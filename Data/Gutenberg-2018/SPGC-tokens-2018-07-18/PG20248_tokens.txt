of
whom
it
may
be
said
how
often
it
has
happened
that
one
man
standing
at
the
right
point
of
view
has
descried
the
truth
and
after
having
been
denounced
and
persecuted
by
all
others
they
have
eventually
been
constrained
to
adopt
his
declarations
draper
the
old
gods
came
to
an
end
long
ago
and
verily
it
was
a
good
and
joyful
end
of
gods
they
did
not
die
lingering
in
the
twilight
although
that
lie
is
told
on
the
contrary
they
once
upon
a
time
laughed
themselves
to
death
that
came
to
pass
when
by
a
god
himself
the
most
ungodly
word
was
uttered
the
word
there
is
but
one
god
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
an
old
grim
beard
of
a
god
a
jealous
one
forgot
himself
thus
and
then
all
gods
laughed
and
shook
on
their
chairs
and
cried
is
godliness
not
just
that
there
are
gods
but
no
god

preface
plain
speaking
is
necessary
in
any
discussion
of
religion
for
if
the
freethinker
attacks
the
religious
dogmas
with
hesitation
the
orthodox
believer
assumes
that
it
is
with
regret
that
the
freethinker
would
remove
the
crutch
that
supports
the
orthodox
and
all
religious
beliefs
are
crutches
hindering
the
free
locomotive
efforts
of
an
advancing
humanity
there
are
no
problems
related
to
human
progress
and
happiness
in
this
age
which
any
theology
can
solve
and
which
the
teachings
of
freethought
can
not
do
better
and
without
the
aid
of
encumbrances
havelock
ellis
has
stated
that
the
man
who
has
never
wrestled
with
his
early
faith
the
faith
that
he
was
brought
up
with
and
that
yet
is
not
truly
his
own
for
no
faith
is
our
own
that
we
have
not
arduously
won
has
missed
not
only
a
moral
but
an
intellectual
discipline
the
absence
of
that
discipline
may
mark
a
man
for
life
and
render
all
his
work
ineffective
he
has
missed
a
training
in
criticism
in
analysis
in
in
the
resolutely
impersonal
treatment
of
personal
problems
which
no
other
training
can
compensate
he
is
for
the
most
part
condemned
to
live
in
a
mental
jungle
where
his
arm
will
soon
be
too
feeble
to
clear
away
the
growths
that
enclose
him
and
his
eyes
too
weak
to
find
the
light
the
man
who
has
allowed
his
mental
capacities
to
clear
his
way
through
the
dense
underbrush
of
religious
dogma
finds
that
he
has
emerged
into
a
purer
and
healthier
atmosphere
in
the
bright
light
of
this
mental
emancipation
a
man
perceives
the
falsities
of
all
religions
in
their
historic
scientific
and
metaphysical
aspects
the
healthier
mental
viewpoint
holds
up
to
scorn
and
discards
the
reactionary
religious
philosophy
of
morals
and
the
sum
total
of
his
conclusions
must
be
that
religion
is
doomed
and
doomed
in
this
modern
day
by
its
absolute
irrelevance
to
the
needs
and
interests
of
modern
life
and
this
not
only
by
the
steadily
increasing
army
of
freethinkers
but
by
the
indifference
and
neglect
of
those
who
still
cling
to
the
fast
slipping
folds
of
religious
creeds
the
future
freethinkers
it
was
spinoza
who
remarked
that
the
proper
study
of
a
wise
man
is
not
how
to
die
but
how
to
live
religious
creeds
can
but
teach
how
man
should
live
so
that
when
he
dies
he
may
be
assured
of
salvation
and
the
important
thing
is
not
what
he
does
to
help
his
fellow
men
while
he
is
living
but
how
closely
he
lives
in
conformity
to
a
reactionary
code
of
dogmas
religion
has
always
aimed
to
smooth
the
sufferer
passage
to
the
next
world
not
to
save
him
for
this
world
freethought
has
dethroned
the
gods
from
the
pedestal
and
has
replaced
not
an
empty
idol
but
an
the
ideal
of
a
man
who
is
his
own
god
it
has
become
increasingly
apparent
that
what
men
have
hitherto
attributed
to
the
gods
are
nothing
but
the
ideals
they
value
and
grope
for
in
themselves
the
ideal
of
the
freethinker
the
conception
that
places
the
supreme
worth
of
human
life
in
the
expanding
horizon
of
usefulness
to
man
is
forever
menaced
by
the
supernaturalism
of
the
theist
which
manifests
itself
in
the
multifarious
religious
sects
that
are
the
most
active
and
constant
menace
to
civilization
and
to
mankind
today
that
religion
in
the
past
has
produced
suffering
incalculable
and
has
been
the
greatest
obstacle
in
the
advance
of
secular
knowledge
is
a
fact
too
well
attested
to
by
history
to
be
denied
by
any
sincere
and
unbiased
intelligent
man
that
today
it
constitutes
a
cultural
lag
an
active
menace
to
the
best
interests
of
humanity
and
the
last
refuge
of
human
savagery
is
the
contention
of
the
freethinker
the
conception
of
the
as
held
by
society
in
general
stands
in
the
same
position
as
the
vermiform
appendix
does
to
the
anatomy
of
man
it
may
have
been
useful
in
some
way
thousands
of
years
ago
but
today
it
constitutes
a
detriment
to
the
of
the
individual
without
offering
any
compensatory
usefulness
agree
or
disagree
with
this
contention
you
may
but
only
when
you
are
made
aware
of
the
facts
that
can
be
brought
to
the
aid
of
this
conviction
just
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
justice
is
outraged
when
a
man
or
an
institution
is
condemned
by
jurist
or
popular
opinion
when
an
opportunity
is
not
given
to
present
the
facts
on
both
aspects
of
the
case
just
so
is
no
man
justified
in
making
a
decision
between
theism
and
atheism
until
he
becomes
acquainted
with
both
sides
of
the
controversy
freethought
but
asks
a
hearing
and
the
exercise
of
the
unbiased
reason
of
the
man
who
has
not
hitherto
been
made
aware
of
its
contentions
in
the
religious
revolution
of
this
twentieth
century
the
battle
ground
is
squarely
seen
to
be
between
supernaturalism
and
secularism
although
the
supernaturalists
are
well
entrenched
and
fortified
it
is
well
to
remember
that
it
is
the
man
with
vision
who
finally
prevails
the
time
has
passed
when
the
freethinker
could
be
held
up
to
the
community
as
an
example
of
a
base
and
degraded
individual
no
manner
of
pulpit
drivel
can
delude
even
the
unthinking
masses
to
this
misconception
the
freethinker
is
today
the
one
who
beholds
the
vision
and
this
vision
does
not
transcend
the
natural
it
is
a
vision
that
is
a
vision
it
may
be
called
since
it
leaps
the
boundary
of
the
present
and
infers
for
him
what
the
future
of
a
secular
organization
of
the
entire
constituency
of
humanity
will
bring
forth
this
vision
is
but
a
product
of
his
scientific
armamentarium
and
is
the
means
by
which
he
is
assured
of
victory
over
the
and
fortified
position
of
the
supernaturalists
who
are
still
to
use
antiquated
and
useless
weapons
the
supernaturalist
armamentarium
of
god
bible
heaven
hell
soul
immortality
sin
the
fall
and
redemption
of
man
prayer
creed
and
dogma
leave
as
much
impression
on
the
mind
of
intelligent
man
as
would
an
arrow
against
a
battleship
and
the
comparison
is
apt
the
supernaturalists
have
made
full
use
of
force
be
it
in
physical
warfare
or
in
mental
coercion
the
freethinker
has
as
much
use
for
physical
force
and
war
as
he
has
for
mental
coercion
both
are
abhorrent
to
him
that
and
that
alone
is
the
field
of
argument
the
supernaturalist
be
he
the
fundamentalist
of
whatever
denomination
or
the
more
advanced
modernist
is
as
tenaciously
clinging
to
the
transcendental
to
revelation
to
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
if
not
in
all
respects
at
least
in
some
although
this
is
a
contradiction
to
the
interdisposition
of
a
deity
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
as
were
his
ancestors
of
five
hundred
years
ago
in
these
aspects
as
well
as
in
the
armamentarium
enumerated
above
the
supernaturalists
are
agreed
and
are
making
their
last
stand
the
secularists
the
opinion
of
the
theists
to
the
contrary
are
also
agreed
it
matters
not
what
a
man
calls
his
mental
process
be
he
infidel
sceptic
rationalist
agnostic
or
atheist
he
is
firm
in
the
conviction
that
religions
of
all
varieties
are
rapidly
sinking
into
the
limbo
of
all
other
ancient
superstitions
to
him
it
is
but
a
matter
of
time
for
the
inevitable
crumbling
and
disappearance
of
these
superstitions
and
the
time
involved
is
directly
proportional
to
the
ease
and
rapidity
with
which
scientific
knowledge
is
disseminated
to
men
who
have
the
mental
capacity
to
understand
the
value
of
this
knowledge
and
its
utter
destruction
of
all
forms
of
supernaturalism
when
man
becomes
fully
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
all
the
knowledge
acquired
by
the
human
race
has
been
the
result
of
human
inquiry
the
result
of
reasoning
processes
and
the
exercise
of
mind
alone
then
secularism
will
have
overcome
the
long
night
of
supernaturalism
and
it
is
this
mental
attitude
of
secularism
that
proceeds
with
an
ever
accelerated
rapidity
to
overcome
the
problems
that
confront
humanity
by
substituting
human
inquiry
for
divine
revelation
thus
this
attitude
of
man
to
proceed
through
life
dependent
only
on
his
own
resources
will
expand
and
strengthen
his
mentality
by
doing
away
with
the
inferiority
complex
of
the
this
vision
of
man
the
master
of
his
own
destinies
the
searcher
for
truth
and
the
shaper
of
a
better
life
for
the
only
existence
that
he
knows
anything
about
this
reliance
of
upon
and
without
the
supposed
interference
of
any
god
constitutes
atheism
in
its
broadest
and
true
sense
science
and
reason
the
constituents
of
secularism
are
the
mortal
enemies
of
supernaturalism
secularism
however
is
at
a
disadvantage
at
this
stage
of
our
mental
development
since
it
is
approached
only
by
the
calm
light
of
the
intellect
and
intellect
can
but
make
an
appeal
to
reason
if
the
seeds
of
these
appeals
fall
on
the
fertile
minds
of
mentally
advanced
humanity
they
will
flourish
if
they
fall
on
the
barren
ground
of
minds
they
take
no
root
recognition
of
facts
and
honest
deductions
are
not
natural
to
the
human
mind
as
far
as
religious
matters
are
concerned
the
vast
majority
of
men
have
not
reached
a
mental
maturity
they
are
still
in
the
infantile
state
where
they
have
not
as
yet
learned
that
the
sequences
of
events
are
not
to
be
interrupted
by
their
desires
the
easier
path
lies
in
the
giving
way
to
the
unstable
emotions
the
primitive
instincts
are
for
emotion
and
for
loose
imaginings
and
these
are
the
provinces
of
supernaturalism
supernaturalism
arouses
the
stupid
interests
and
the
brutish
passions
and
from
these
are
born
the
bitter
fruits
of
ignorance
and
hatred
the
secularist
is
one
in
whom
the
intellect
is
passionate
and
the
passions
cold
the
supernaturalist
on
the
other
hand
reverses
the
order
and
in
him
the
passions
are
active
and
the
intellect
inert
in
each
man
there
dwells
a
tyrant
who
creates
for
him
a
deity
materialized
out
of
these
factors
of
ignorance
and
fear
it
is
science
and
reason
which
must
destroy
for
him
this
monstrous
apparition
but
as
yet
there
is
no
indication
that
our
mental
development
in
relation
to
social
progress
has
made
the
great
strides
that
our
purely
material
progress
has
made
the
twentieth
century
man
utilizes
and
enjoys
the
material
benefits
of
his
century
but
his
mental
progress
lies
bound
and
drugged
by
the
viewpoints
of
years
ago
sir
leslie
stephen
has
declared
how
much
intellect
and
zeal
runs
to
waste
in
the
spasmodic
efforts
of
good
men
to
cling
to
the
last
fragment
of
decaying
systems
to
galvanize
dead
formulæ
into
some
dim
semblance
of
life
society
will
not
improve
as
it
might
when
those
who
should
be
leaders
of
progress
are
staggering
backward
and
forward
with
their
eyes
passionately
reverted
to
the
past
nay
we
shall
never
be
duly
sensitive
to
the
miseries
and
cruelties
which
make
the
world
a
place
of
torture
for
so
many
so
long
as
men
are
encouraged
in
the
name
of
religion
to
look
for
a
remedy
not
in
fighting
against
surrounding
evils
but
in
cultivating
aimless
contemplations
of
an
imaginary
ideal
much
of
our
popular
religion
seems
to
be
expressly
directed
to
deaden
our
sympathies
with
our
fellow
men
by
encouraging
an
indolent
optimism
our
thoughts
of
the
other
world
are
used
in
many
forms
as
an
opiate
to
drug
our
minds
with
indifference
to
the
evils
of
this
and
the
last
word
of
half
of
our
preachers
is
rather
than
work
there
is
always
a
great
deal
of
discrepancy
between
that
which
is
best
for
the
gods
and
that
which
is
best
for
the
individual
and
for
society
in
general
one
can
not
serve
man
perfectly
and
the
traditional
gods
as
well
it
is
therefore
the
contention
of
freethinkers
that
if
man
had
given
to
the
service
of
man
all
that
he
had
given
to
the
gods
in
the
past
our
present
stage
of
civilization
would
be
much
in
advance
of
where
it
is
today
if
there
is
anything
in
the
discussion
to
follow
that
may
seem
irreverent
to
the
reader
the
author
wishes
to
call
attention
that
he
has
but
presented
well
substantiated
facts
it
is
not
only
his
opinion
that
he
is
voicing
but
it
is
the
facts
as
he
has
found
them
recorded
in
the
researches
of
numerous
sincere
men
finally
it
is
the
conviction
of
all
freethinkers
that
as
professor
james
leuba
has
stated
it
is
furthermore
essential
to
intellectual
and
moral
advances
that
the
beliefs
that
come
into
existence
should
have
free
play
antagonistic
beliefs
must
have
the
chance
of
proving
their
worth
in
open
contest
it
is
this
way
scientific
theories
are
tested
and
in
this
way
also
religious
and
ethical
conceptions
should
be
tried
but
a
fair
struggle
can
not
take
place
when
people
are
dissuaded
from
seeking
knowledge
or
when
knowledge
is
hidden
the
cultivation
of
the
intellect
is
a
duty
that
is
imposed
on
all
men
even
those
who
still
cling
to
the
dying
beliefs
must
admit
the
force
of
what
winwood
reade
said
to
cultivate
the
intellect
is
therefore
a
religious
duty
and
when
this
truth
is
fairly
recognized
by
men
the
religion
which
teaches
that
the
intellect
should
be
distrusted
and
that
it
should
be
subservient
to
faith
will
inevitably
fall
when
the
principles
of
freethought
shall
have
dispelled
the
intellectual
cloud
of
the
and
the
vanishing
dream
of
a
heaven
which
has
too
long
drawn
men
eyes
away
from
this
earth
then
and
then
only
will
these
words
of
cicero
have
widespread
meaning
men
were
born
for
the
sake
of
men
that
each
should
assist
the
others
the
necessity
of

chapter
i
the
evolution
of
religious
beliefs
early
man
the
gods
were
real
in
the
same
sense
that
the
mountains
forests
or
waterfalls
which
were
thought
to
be
their
homes
were
real
for
a
long
time
the
spirits
that
lived
in
drugs
or
wines
and
made
them
potent
were
believed
to
be
of
the
same
order
of
fact
as
the
potency
itself
but
the
human
creature
is
curious
and
curiosity
is
bold
hence
the
discovery
that
a
reported
god
may
be
a
max
carl
otto
the
geologists
estimate
that
the
age
of
the
earth
is
somewhere
between
and
millions
of
years
that
the
neanderthal
race
existed
for
more
than
years
that
between
and
years
ago
as
the
fourth
glacial
period
softened
towards
more
temperate
conditions
a
different
human
type
came
upon
the
scene
and
exterminated
homo
neanderthalensis
these
first
true
men
descended
from
some
more
progenitors
and
are
classed
by
ethnologists
with
the
same
species
as
ourselves
and
with
all
human
races
subsequent
to
them
under
one
common
specific
term
homo
sapiens
the
age
of
cultivation
began
with
the
neolithic
phase
of
human
affairs
about
or
years
ago
about
or
years
ago
men
began
to
gather
into
the
first
towns
and
to
develop
something
more
than
the
tribes
which
had
hitherto
been
their
highest
political
organization
altogether
there
must
have
elapsed
about
years
from
the
earliest
human
stage
of
life
on
this
planet
to
the
present
time
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
age
of
our
present
civilization
is
by
no
means
that
which
the
bible
stipulates
but
is
merely
an
atom
in
the
vast
of
this
earth
the
reason
for
this
disparity
is
that
with
the
development
of
the
mind
of
man
throughout
the
ages
there
was
conceived
also
his
religious
systems
based
on
a
subjective
interpretation
of
the
universe
and
not
on
an
objective
one
devoid
of
emotional
bias
primitive
man
did
not
understand
the
natural
cause
of
shadows
echoes
the
birth
and
death
of
vegetable
and
animal
organisms
of
this
ignorance
religion
was
born
and
theology
was
evolved
as
its
art
of
expression
our
story
takes
us
back
some
twelve
thousand
years
to
neolithic
man
squatting
in
his
rude
hovel
or
gloomy
cave
he
listens
to
the
sounds
of
a
storm
without
the
howling
of
the
wind
the
flashes
of
lightning
and
crashing
of
thunder
give
rise
to
that
elemental
emotion
fear
fear
was
always
with
him
as
he
thought
of
the
huge
stones
that
fell
and
crushed
him
and
the
beasts
which
were
so
eager
to
devour
him
all
things
about
him
seemed
to
conspire
for
his
death
the
wind
lightning
thunder
rain
and
storm
as
well
as
the
beasts
and
falling
trees
for
in
his
mind
he
did
not
differentiate
animate
from
inanimate
objects
slowly
through
his
groping
mind
there
evolved
the
thought
due
to
past
experience
that
he
could
not
contend
with
these
things
by
physical
force
but
must
subdue
them
with
magic
his
magic
consisted
of
the
beating
of
crude
instruments
dances
and
the
mumbling
of
words
upon
falling
asleep
he
dreams
and
awakening
he
finds
that
he
is
still
in
the
same
place
where
he
had
lain
the
night
before
yet
he
is
certain
that
during
the
night
he
had
traveled
to
his
favorite
wood
and
killed
an
animal
whose
tender
flesh
he
was
still
savoring
since
the
conception
of
a
dream
was
as
yet
foreign
to
him
the
logical
conclusion
he
arrived
at
was
that
he
had
both
a
body
and
a
spirit
if
he
possessed
a
body
and
a
spirit
then
all
things
about
him
he
reasoned
must
likewise
possess
a
similar
spirit
some
spirits
he
felt
were
friendly
some
hostile
to
him
the
hostile
spirits
were
to
be
feared
but
that
powerful
factor
hope
had
at
last
entered
into
his
mind
and
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
win
them
over
to
the
camp
of
friendly
spirits
in
this
manner
man
passed
from
the
stage
of
contending
against
the
spirits
to
one
of
placating
them
it
was
believed
that
certain
men
carried
more
favor
with
the
spirits
than
others
and
these
became
the
original
priests
called
the
shamans
another
expedient
for
warding
off
evil
spirits
was
by
means
of
the
fetish
the
primitive
fetish
was
an
object
containing
an
active
friendly
spirit
which
if
worn
by
the
individual
protected
him
from
the
evil
spirits
in
a
short
while
the
manufacture
of
fetishes
became
a
sacred
profession
and
the
men
who
were
thought
to
fashion
the
best
ones
became
the
professional
holy
men
of
the
period
the
priests
at
first
idols
were
used
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirits
and
then
the
conception
changed
to
one
of
attracting
the
good
spirits
to
man
from
the
individual
fetish
man
passed
to
tribal
ones
which
in
their
first
form
were
huge
boulders
and
trees
as
the
primitive
mind
gained
cunning
it
slyly
smeared
the
surface
of
the
idol
with
oily
substances
hoping
that
the
spirit
like
some
wild
beast
would
come
and
lick
be
gratified
and
remain
in
the
idol
when
some
favorable
signs
denoted
that
a
good
spirit
had
entered
into
the
idol
it
was
regularly
smeared
with
oils
and
then
blood
in
the
hope
that
the
spirit
would
be
pleased
sufficiently
to
remain
there
permanently
as
time
went
on
it
became
a
custom
a
rite
and
the
spirit
having
performed
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
tribe
ways
were
invented
to
manifest
their
gratitude
instead
of
smearing
the
idol
with
blood
it
was
thought
more
fitting
that
an
animal
be
killed
and
offered
to
the
good
spirit
contained
within
the
idol
in
this
manner
arose
the
beginning
of
sacrifice
it
was
at
this
time
when
man
began
to
persuade
the
idols
or
spirits
to
do
things
for
his
benefit
that
religion
began
slowly
slowly
down
through
the
ages
as
the
mind
of
man
progressed
his
religious
conceptions
advanced
he
now
worshiped
idols
and
these
idols
were
his
gods
the
celts
the
babylonians
the
greeks
the
romans
all
had
their
idols
all
were
certain
that
their
gods
were
the
true
ones
and
that
the
others
were
all
inferior
and
even
false
gods
but
is
the
modern
worshipper
who
is
contemptuous
of
the
ancients
very
different
from
them
the
centuries
pass
by
and
in
their
wake
is
man
religion
now
some
men
take
the
prerogative
in
the
manufacture
of
religion
and
there
evolve
brahmanism
jainism
buddhism
hinduism
confucianism
taoism
and
zoroastrianism
all
inspired
all
supernatural
and
with
their
myriads
of
followers
who
believed
and
still
believe
that
theirs
is
the
only
true
creed
very
recently
in
the
of
our
development
man
adopted
the
methods
of
big
business
and
the
religion
of
many
gods
and
idols
polytheism
has
given
way
to
one
supreme
god
monotheism
man
found
that
it
made
for
simplicity
and
saved
his
valuable
time
if
he
worshiped
one
god
instead
of
obeying
the
hitherto
many
the
chosen
people
took
it
upon
themselves
to
bring
the
next
divinely
concocted
conception
of
a
supreme
god
and
they
manufactured
the
creed
of
judaism
after
many
years
a
rift
arose
among
the
jews
and
the
sectarians
were
defeated
and
expelled
foiled
in
their
first
object
they
cast
aside
the
laws
of
moses
and
offered
the
hebrew
religion
without
the
hebrew
ceremonies
to
the
greek
and
roman
world
jesus
was
the
man
who
prepared
the
way
for
this
remarkable
event
when
mohammed
conceived
the
divine
conception
that
he
would
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
his
moses
and
jesus
the
latest
of
the
major
religions
was
revealed
at
the
present
time
the
hebrews
and
christians
although
worshiping
the
same
jehovah
are
disputing
with
each
other
and
indeed
amongst
themselves
with
regard
to
the
various
attributes
amorous
pursuits
and
lineal
descendants
of
the
godhead
jehovah
himself
appears
to
be
on
the
decline
and
his
unity
is
steadily
disintegrating
into
a
paradoxical
trinity
but
we
are
progressing
for
in
years
no
new
prophet
has
arisen
and
no
new
divine
revelation
is
perturbing
our
race
the
old
ones
however
are
causing
quite
enough
disturbance
it
would
be
of
value
for
the
modern
religionist
who
believes
that
the
worship
of
a
deity
in
our
own
age
is
far
removed
from
the
worship
of
an
idol
by
our
savage
ancestors
to
retrace
his
steps
and
compare
the
savage
mind
worshiping
his
particular
idol
and
a
civilized
mind
of
today
worshiping
his
deity
the
savage
prayed
to
his
idol
that
is
he
he
begged
the
idol
to
watch
over
his
flock
or
his
fields
the
modern
prays
that
is
he
begs
of
his
idol
his
deity
to
prosper
his
business
to
guard
his
life
and
as
one
of
my
acquaintances
recently
informed
me
on
the
eve
of
an
important
golf
match
for
the
deity
to
give
him
endurance
in
other
words
to
cut
down
his
golf
score
the
savage
voiced
his
incantations
the
modern
sings
hymns
that
is
he
flatters
there
is
still
a
great
deal
of
the
charlatanry
of
the
magician
in
the
construction
of
the
houses
of
prayer
with
the
sunlight
shut
out
and
only
filtering
through
the
leaded
and
panes
the
semidarkness
the
solemnity
the
rise
and
swell
of
the
organ
all
things
combined
to
overcome
the
senses
to
play
upon
the
emotions
and
to
subdue
the
reason
the
savage
made
sacrifices
to
his
idols
that
is
he
paid
tribute
chiefly
out
of
fear
but
partly
in
the
hope
of
getting
something
better
in
return
the
modern
does
not
offer
human
or
animal
sacrifice
it
is
true
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
wealth
of
the
savage
consisted
of
his
sheep
oxen
oils
and
wines
not
money
today
the
devout
offer
a
sacrifice
of
money
to
the
deity
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
requests
of
religious
institutions
for
gifts
which
nearly
always
finish
with
the
phrase
and
the
lord
will
repay
you
many
fold
in
other
words
sacrifice
part
of
your
worldly
goods
to
the
idol
and
he
will
repay
with
high
interest
he
will
give
in
return
long
life
and
much
riches
the
savage
was
afraid
to
utter
the
real
name
of
his
god
it
was
taboo
the
modern
says
take
not
the
name
of
the
lord
in
vain
even
today
the
followers
of
moses
consider
it
taboo
to
utter
the
name
of
jehovah
except
in
prayer
the
methods
of
worship
are
no
different
from
those
of
the
savage
the
method
of
supplication
has
changed
with
the
advance
of
the
years
but
the
fundamental
ideas
at
the
base
of
all
worship
are
just
as
crude
today
as
they
were
years
ago
primitive
man
was
no
more
a
fetishist
than
is
the
modern
catholic
the
latter
still
wears
medals
and
images
suspended
from
the
neck
and
pinned
to
the
inner
clothing
moreover
a
survey
of
the
various
religions
extant
indicates
that
the
religious
factor
is
no
less
prevalent
today
than
it
was
in
primitive
societies
in
greenland
one
finds
that
through
nearly
all
of
its
vast
area
religion
has
no
place
but
that
is
chiefly
the
result
of
its
being
largely
uninhabited
in
alaska
the
population
is
for
the
most
part
catholic
although
the
natives
are
animists
in
canada
per
cent
are
catholic
the
rest
are
mainly
protestant
in
the
united
states
per
cent
are
catholic
per
cent
are
jewish
and
the
remainder
are
protestants
mexico
central

south

are
almost
entirely
roman
catholic
in

russia
was
until
recently
dominantly
greek
orthodox
the
scandinavian

the

are
dominantly
protestant
while
france
portugal
spain
italy
and
the
rest
of
the
countries
bordering
the
mediterranean
sea
are
catholic
the
rest
of
the
continent
is
divided
between
jews
and
mohammedans
in
asia
the
entire
vast
area
of
siberia
is
only
sparsely
settled
and
its
religions
include
animism
taoism
and
christianity
in
china
we
find
the
land
of
three
truths
confucianism
taoism
and
buddhism
india
tibet
and
burma
are
dominated
by
hinduism
and
buddhism
arabia
persia
and
the
rest
of
the

are
mohammedan
in
japan
there
are
the
shintoists
the
east
indies
where
the
population
is
native
are
animistic
in
australia
the
dominant
religion
is
protestantism
in
north
africa
the
west

inhabitants
are
mohammedans
while
the
abyssinians
are
christians
there
are
some
coptic
christians
in
egypt
while
in
the
congo
and
south
african
countries
down
to
the
cape
settlements
the
natives
are
animists
the
cape
settlements
themselves
are
protestants
more
concretely
it
is
estimated
that
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
are
protestants
are
catholics
are
greek
orthodox
are
animists
are
shintoists
are
confucians
and
taoists
are
hindus
are
buddhists
are
moslems
and
are
hebrews
and
unclassified
sects
truly
a
religious
babel
and
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
about
the
same
number
of
people
who
profess
to
protestantism
are
animists
this
is
the
lowest
stage
of
primitive
religion
and
millions
of
humans
are
still
quagmired
in
the
sloth
of
a
primitive
faith
which
once
must
have
been
the
faith
of
all
human
beings
the
mohammedan
the
jew
the
christian
will
readily
agree
that
the
animism
the
fetishism
and
idolatry
of
the
savage
were
foolish
beliefs
they
can
readily
perceive
that
there
was
nothing
supernatural
nothing
revealed
in
such
beliefs
but
they
do
not
realize
that
to
him
in
his
infantile
development
the
fetish
and
the
idol
were
just
as
supernatural
and
superior
as
the
modern
conception
of
a
supreme
being
in
each
age
man
creates
his
god
in
his
own
image
and
within
the
confines
of
his
own
mental
development
the
mind
of
man
has
expanded
so
that
it
has
conquered
more
and
more
of
his
environment
it
has
grown
and
wrested
from
nature
those
secrets
which
constitute
his
civilization
along
with
this
has
progressed
the
conception
of
a
deity
but
only
to
a
certain
extent
the
mind
has
embellished
the
outward
appearance
of
its
gods
consolidated
them
and
built
upon
them
intricate
systems
of
theology
upon
which
feed
vast
hordes
of
clergy
but
the
basic
conception
the
fundamental
principle
that
there
must
be
something
supernatural
to
explain
something
which
we
can
not
explain
at
the
present
moment
that
conception
still
drugs
the
mind
of
man
primitive
man
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
lightning
thunder
shadows
echoes
and
he
placed
these
among
the
supernatural
phenomena
the
modern
mind
explains
these
phenomena
understands
the
laws
governing
their
production
yet
it
is
this
same
modern
mind
which
persists
in
going
back
to
our
savage
ancestors
and
their
mental
sloth
by
attributing
the
myriads
of
phenomena
which
still
elude
its
present
stage
of
mental
development
to
a
particular
idol
this
time
a
supreme
being
brahmanism
jainism
buddhism
hinduism
confucianism
taoism
zoroastrianism
hebrewism
mohammedanism
christianity
which
is
the
true
religion
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
an
inhabitant
of
mars
if
there
be
such
were
by
a
miracle
to
be
transported
to
this
earth
and
endowed
with
the
mental
capacity
of
the
average
inhabitant
of
the
earth
a
thing
which
perhaps
would
not
be
so
flattering
to
our
guest
were
to
be
approached
by
a
zealot
of
each
one
of
these
faiths
who
hoped
to
convert
this
stranger
to
its
ranks
since
the
factor
of
coercion
by
force
of
environment
to
which
each
of
these
earthlings
was
subject
would
naturally
be
absent
the
martian
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
fair
choice
how
much
would
the
visitor
be
impressed
by
the
statements
of
the
christian
mohammedan
or
jew
when
advised
that
unless
he
embraced
their
particular
creed
he
would
be
damned
to
eternal
torture
in
their
particular
hell
if
a
christian
were
to
accost
him
and
endeavor
to
put
the
fear
of
god
into
him
and
if
our
visitor
being
from
mars
already
knew
that
of
the
world
population
only
about
per
cent
are
christians
and
the
other
per
cent
are
is
it
logical
to
suppose
that
he
would
ever
be
convinced
that
an
omniscient
omnipotent
benevolent
supreme
being
would
select
only
one
quarter
of
his
children
whom
he
had
created
for
redemption
with
the
infallible
knowledge
that
nearly
of
them
would
be
confined
to
hell
for
not
believing
what
he
could
have
made
them
believe
if
he
were
truly
omnipotent
omniscient
and
benevolent
would
he
not
rather
reply
that
on
his
planet
such
a
father
who
would
select
some
of
his
children
for
rewards
and
maliciously
torture
his
other
children
would
not
be
designated
as
a
god
but
a
devil
were
the
martian
to
be
further
informed
that
each
one
of
children
was
represented
in
actual
figures
by
hundreds
of
millions
and
that
these
have
been
living
on
the
planet
earth
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
and
were
the
visitor
to
contemplate
the
vast
incomprehensible
number
of
souls
that
have
been
confined
to
hell
by
such
a
father
might
he
not
cut
his
visit
short
he
would
be
apt
to
repeat
with
james
mill
think
of
a
being
who
would
make
a
hell
who
would
create
the
human
race
with
the
infallible
foreknowledge
and
therefore
with
the
intention
that
the
great
majority
of
them
should
be
consigned
to
horrible
and
everlasting
torment
i
believe
that
our
guest
would
assert
that
if
such
a
being
actually
existed
and
demanded
worship
he
would
certainly
have
revealed
his
true
belief
to
the
first
man
adam
and
therefore
saved
his
children
an
inestimable
amount
of
suffering
were
the
visitor
to
be
further
pressed
by
the
zealot
with
the
vision
of
eternal
hell
i
believe
he
would
retort
that
there
is
no
reason
for
god
to
punish
those
who
doubt
or
deny
faith
in
his
existence
since
it
is
his
own
doing
and
if
he
desired
each
one
of
his
children
to
worship
him
according
to
the
precepts
of
a
certain
creed
he
surely
would
have
instilled
that
creed
into
man
together
with
the
rest
of
his
characteristics
undoubtedly
he
would
not
esteem
any
creed
which
damned
the
human
intellect
by
cursing
the
doubts
which
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
its
exercise
or
the
creed
which
cursed
the
moral
faculty
by
asserting
the
guilt
of
honest
error
if
our
visitor
would
but
glance
at
the
history
the
evolution
of
religious
beliefs
he
would
realize
and
soundly
assert
that
all
religions
are
human
in
their
origins
erroneous
in
their
theories
and
ridiculous
in
their
threats
and
rewards
chapter

the

and
the

and
new
testaments
jews
emerge
into
history
not
a
nation
of
keen
spiritual
aspirations
and
altruistic
ethics
but
that
pagan
people
worshipping
rocks
sheep
and
cattle
and
spirits
of
caves
and

of
whom
the
old
testament
tending
towards
its

ideal
gives

convincing
james
shotwell
jahveh
cruel
god
of
a
horde
of
nomadic
invaders
settling
in
a
land
of
farmers
he
had
his
images
ranging
in
elaboration
from
an
uncut
mazzebah
or
asherah
to
a
golden
bull
he
was
plural
by
place
and
tribe
and
function
what
did
the
prophetic
movement
do
with
his
sacred
powers
it
identified
his
taboos
with
a
written
horace
kallen
mental
attitude
of
these
ancestors
of
ours
is
amazing
they
were
like
children
in
the
hands
of
unscrupulous
teachers
in
reading
these
old
chronicles
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
shocked
by
the
incongruity
ever
arising
out
of
the
juxtaposition
of
theory
and
llewelyn
powys
our
martian
visitor
having
withstood
the
blasts
of
the
zealot
is
approached
by
a
mohammedan
who
places
in
his
hands
the
koran
and
tells
him
that
it
is
a
divinely
inspired
revelation
as
revealed
by
allah
through
his
prophet
mohammed
having
already
had
some
experience
with
earthly
religionists
the
martian
is
disposed
to
avail
himself
of
the
historical
evidence
regarding
the
life
of
mohammed
he
finds
that
mohammed
from
all
accounts
was
a
demagogue
a
charlatan
and
a
victim
of
mental
disease
it
strikes
him
strangely
that
such
an
individual
should
be
chosen
by
allah
as
his
disciple
on
earth
to
make
known
his
commands
he
notes
mohammed
appearance
on
earth
in
and
wonders
why
the
creator
should
have
procrastinated
for
such
a
long
time
but
decides
to
read
the
revelations
anyhow
he
discovers
that
from
the
literary
point
of
view
the
koran
has
little
merit
declamation
repetition
puerility
a
lack
of
logic
and
incoherence
strike
him
at
every
turn
he
finds
it
humiliating
to
the
human
intellect
to
think
that
this
mediocre
literature
has
been
the
subject
of
innumerable
commentaries
and
that
millions
of
men
are
still
wasting
time
in
absorbing
it
a
hebrew
next
takes
his
turn
at
this
obstinate
guest
and
sets
before
him
the
old
testament
again
the
martian
is
informed
that
it
is
an
inspired
book
actuated
by
god
in
his
attempt
to
find
the
historical
evidence
corroborating
this
book
the
martian
finds
that
authentic
history
begins
for
the
israelites
with
the
constitution
of
saul
monarchy
about
all
that
precedes
this
the
deluge
the
dispersal
of
mankind
abraham
jacob
joseph
the
captivity
in
egypt
moses
joshua
and
the
conquest
of
canaan
is
more
or
less
mythical
in
the
old
testament
our
martian
reads
the
first
chapter
glances
at
the
chronology
and
is
immediately
bewildered
since
he
has
a
fair
knowledge
of
our
scientific
advances
as
he
reads
on
he
becomes
aware
of
a
host
of
errors
contradictions
and
manifest
absurdities
when
he
questions
the
zealous
hebrew
he
comes
in
contact
with
what
he
is
informed
is
concordism
which
he
perceives
is
a
false
science
that
consists
in
determining
at
any
cost
a
perfect
harmony
between
modern
science
and
the
knowledge
possessed
by
god
people
he
is
thus
told
that
the
days
of
creation
were
not
days
at
all
but
periods
although
the
bible
mentions
the
morning
and
evening
of
each
day
delving
further
in
this
most
holy
of
revelations
he
learns
that
god
is
represented
in
a
manner
most
unworthy
of
what
such
a
being
should
be
represented
he
finds
the
lord
walking
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
showing
his
hind
quarters
to
moses
ordering
abominable
massacres
and
punishing
chiefs
who
had
not
killed
enough
people
on
further
perusal
there
is
revealed
a
great
deal
of
oriental
bombast
incoherence
and
absurdity
that
the
marvels
recounted
are
often
ludicrous
or
grotesque
in
a
chance
moment
when
the
hebrew
had
relaxed
his
hold
for
a
second
a
vile
heretic
points
out
to
the
visitor
xxii
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
and
explains
the
witchcraft
delusion
to
him
from
a
comparison
between
exodus
xxxiv
and
exodus
xx
he
is
at
a
loss
to
decipher
which
are
the
true
commandments
that
the
lord
gave
to
moses
the
first
five
books
of
the
pentateuch
he
finds
are
attributed
to
moses
although
they
contain
the
account
of
the
latter
death
on
inquiry
he
learns
that
this
is
still
maintained
by
the
synagogue
his
martian
intellect
is
unable
to
comprehend
the
logic
of
a
god
who
would
demand
human
and
animal
sacrifice
and
the
story
of
abraham
about
to
sacrifice
his
son
isaac
fills
him
with
disgust
his
estimate
of
the
mentality
of
jehovah
receives
a
severe
jolt
when
he
reads
in
leviticus
xvi
herewith
shall
aaron
come
unto
the
holy
place
with
a
young
bullock
for
a
sin
offering
and
a
ram
for
a
burnt
offering
he
shall
put
on
the
holy
linen
coat
and
he
shall
have
the
linen
breeches
upon
his
flesh
and
he
shall
be
girded
with
the
linen
girdle
and
with
the
linen
mitre
shall
he
be
attired
they
are
the
holy
garments
and
he
shall
bathe
his
flesh
in
water
and
put
them
on
and
he
shall
take
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
two
for
a
sin
offering
and
one
ram
for
a
burnt
offering
and
aaron
shall
present
the
bullock
of
the
sin
offering
which
is
for
himself
and
he
shall
make
atonement
for
himself
and
for
his
houses
and
he
shall
take
the
two
goats
and
set
them
before
the
lord
at
the
door
of
the
tent
of
the
meeting
our
visitor
reads
on
to
leviticus
xviii
after
which
he
must
stop
to
question
the
hebrew
for
here
he
finds
none
of
you
shall
approach
to
any
that
is
near
of
kin
to
him
to
uncover
their
nakedness
i
am
the
lord
the
nakedness
of
thy
father
even
the
nakedness
of
thy
mother
shalt
thou
not
uncover
she
is
thy
mother
thou
shalt
not
uncover
her
nakedness
the
nakedness
of
thy
father
wife
shalt
thou
not
uncover
it
is
thy
father
nakedness
the
nakedness
of
thy
sister
the
daughter
of
thy
father
or
daughter
of
thy
mother
whether
she
be
born
at
home
or
abroad
even
their
nakedness
thou
shalt
not
uncover
the
nakedness
of
thy
son
wife
the
nakedness
of
the
wife
of
thy
father
the
nakedness
of
thy
father
sister
thy
mother
sister
the
nakedness
of
thy
thy
brother
wife
the
nakedness
of
a
woman
and
her
daughter
thou
shalt
not
uncover
and
unto
a
woman
separated
by
her
uncleanliness
thou
shalt
not
approach
to
uncover
her
nakedness
thou
shalt
not
be
carnally
with
thy
neighbor
wife
to
defile
thyself
with
her
thou
shalt
not
be
with
mankind
as
with
womankind
and
thou
shalt
not
be
with
any
beast
to
defile
thyself
thereto
neither
shall
any
woman
stand
before
a
beast
to
lie
down
thereto
it
is
confusion
the
martian
totally
aghast
is
constrained
to
exclaim
that
he
can
not
believe
that
a
deity
should
find
it
necessary
to
place
this
in
a
divine
revelation
the
hebrew
zealot
relents
somewhat
to
explain
that
perhaps
this
was
not
revealed
but
found
its
way
into
the
divine
text
as
a
moral
lesson
to
the
primitive
tribes
for
which
it
was
written
to
this
our
guest
counters
with
the
remark
that
if
this
be
a
parable
of
manners
and
morals
then
from
what
he
observes
on
the
earth
we
earthlings
have
certainly
outgrown
the
need
for
such
coarse
and
obscene
statements
made
some
years
ago
and
that
on
mars
although
the
inhabitants
are
not
blessed
with
such
divine
revelations
common
sense
and
reason
have
taught
their
most
primitive
men
the
same
lessons
in
morality
while
they
were
yet
in
their
infancy
reflecting
on
this
maze
of
contradictions
the
martian
determines
to
analyze
the
old
testament
and
the
hebrew
religion
in
the
same
manner
that
he
would
investigate
any
other
problem
presented
to
him
hundred
years
ago
the
hebrews
were
a
pastoral
primitive
people
inhabiting
the
wilderness
known
today
as
the
arabian
desert
their
religion
was
that
of
all
other
primitive
peoples
animism
an
illusion
which
made
primitive
man
recognize
everywhere
spirits
similar
to
his
own
spirit
they
worshiped
the
spirits
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
the
mountains
and
rocks
as
well
as
the
spirits
of
the
dead
it
appears
certain
that
the
barrenness
of
this
desert
land
necessitated
these
wandering
tribes
to
migrate
to
adjacent
areas
of
greater
fertility
to
the
north
lay
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
and
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
sea
to
the
west
lay
the
land
of
the
egyptians
time
and
time
again
these
bedouin
tribes
hurled
themselves
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
fertile
valleys
babylonia
to
the
northeast
was
the
first
country
to
be
invaded
and
later
canaan
to
the
northwest
successful
at
times
in
establishing
themselves
in
babylonia
and
canaan
they
were
at
other
times
driven
back
into
the
desert
when
the
native
inhabitants
in
turn
attacked
the
invaders
migrating
into
egypt
in
search
of
food
they
were
made
a
captive
nation
and
escaped
again
into
the
desert
when
the
egyptians
were
engaged
in
fighting
the
savage
invaders
from
libya
the
leader
of
this
flight
from
egypt
was
the
prophet
moses
the
martian
decides
to
investigate
the
character
and
deeds
of
this
influential
figure
at
another
time
it
is
probable
that
the
exodus
gave
the
proper
stimulus
for
the
beginnings
of
a
distinctive
hebrew
religion
and
was
the
reason
for
their
finally
establishing
themselves
in
canaan
with
jehovah
as
their
chief
deity
it
has
often
been
proclaimed
that
the
value
of
judaism
has
been
in
first
establishing
a
religion
of
monotheism
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
centuries
before
the
hebrews
escaped
into
the
desert
the
egyptians
were
tending
to
monotheism
it
is
known
that
one
god
was
exalted
over
all
the
rest
in
egypt
and
that
as
far
back
as
king
ikhnaton
made
the
religion
of
egypt
an
absolute
monotheism
the
hebrews
in
proclaiming
their
yahveh
as
the
one
and
supreme
deity
were
but
following
what
they
had
assimilated
from
the
egyptians
the
faith
of
these
desert
marauders
at
the
time
of
their
entrance
into
canaan
was
as
crude
and
savage
as
the
hebrews
themselves
brought
into
contact
with
the
gods
of
the
phoenicians
and
babylonians
their
yahveh
underwent
a
change
as
have
all
other
creeds
since
that
time
when
brought
into
contact
with
another
creed
the
final
idea
of
yahveh
accepted
by
the
hebrews
was
not
the
product
of
a
sudden
revelation
but
of
a
gradual
evolution
the
hebrews
about
the
twelfth
century
gained
access
into
canaan
and
at
first
were
successful
in
warfare
so
that
under
king
david
they
presented
the
aspect
of
a
united
nation
however
following
the
extravagant
reign
of
king
solomon
the
nation
was
embroiled
in
a
revolution
and
the
land
was
divided
into
two
kingdoms
israel
in
the
north
judah
in
the
south
these
two
tiny
kingdoms
were
habitually
at
war
with
each
other
and
finally
in
israel
was
conquered
while
in
judah
was
defeated
and
its
population
either
scattered
or
taken
into
captivity
in
cyrus
of
persia
conquered
babylonia
and
set
the
exiles
free
returning
to
their
own
land
the
exiles
took
back
with
them
the
law
code
which
the
priests
had
manufactured
for
them
then
began
a
period
of
priestly
domination
and
corruption
a
period
of
subjugation
to
rome
of
insurrection
against
rome
and
the
capture
and
destruction
of
jerusalem
in
with
the
capture
of
jerusalem
the
hebrew
nation
was
finally
dispersed
just
as
the
martian
was
able
to
trace
the
evolution
of
the
hebrews
from
the
stage
of
the
marauding
tribes
of
the
arabian
desert
who
wandered
into
egypt
canaan
and
babylonia
and
finally
established
a
kingdom
for
themselves
which
was
dispersed
by
rome
just
so
could
he
trace
the
evolution
of
their
religious
beliefs
from
their
incipient
crudities
to
their
not
too
great
refinement
at
this
evolution
of
the
hebrew
religion
is
best
exemplified
by
an
analysis
of
the
old
testament
itself
there
are
several
canons
or
official
collection
of
books
which
comprise
the
old
testament
the
jews
and
protestants
accept
fewer
books
than
the
roman
catholics
the
jewish
canon
consists
of
those
sacred
books
of
which
the
synagogue
possessed
hebrew
texts
about
a
century
before
the
christian
era
about
the
sacred
books
of
the
jews
were
translated
into
greek
for
the
use
of
those
egyptian
jews
who
could
not
read
hebrew
this
translation
is
called
the
septuagint
from
a
tradition
that
seventy
or
translators
had
worked
upon
it
reinach
the
earliest
manuscripts
of
the
hebrew
bible
date
only
from
the
tenth
century
but
there
are
very
much
older
manuscripts
of
the
greek
and
latin
translations
in
existence
at
the
time
of
jesus
christ
three
divisions
of
the
old
testament
were
recognized
these
were
the
law
the
prophets
and
the
other
scriptures
the
first
five
books
genesis
exodus
numbers
leviticus
and
deuteronomy
are
known
as
the
pentateuch
and
are
attributed
to
moses
himself
although
as
has
been
noted
they
contain
the
account
of
his
death
this
conception
of
the
mosaic
origin
of
the
pentateuch
was
accepted
by
the
israelites
as
early
as
the
fifth
century
and
has
been
maintained
by
the
synagogue
since
that
time
following
the
example
of
the
hebrews
the
christian
churches
accepted
this
version
as
to
origin
and
the
roman
catholic
church
still
upholds
this
view
the
jewish
synagogue
and
the
various
christian
churches
further
hold
that
the
old
testament
is
a
collection
of
works
inspired
or
dictated
by
god
even
as
late
as
the
famous
dean
burgon
in
a
sermon
preached
at
oxford
university
declared
the
bible
is
none
other
than
the
voice
of
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
every
book
of
it
every
chapter
of
it
every
verse
of
it
every
syllable
of
it
every
letter
of
it
is
the
direct
utterance
of
the
most
high
the
bible
is
none
other
than
the
word
of
god
not
some
part
of
it
more
some
part
of
it
less
but
all
alike
the
utterance
of
him
who
sitteth
upon
the
throne
faultless
unerring
supreme
the
martian
compared
this
statement
with
the
words
of
the
scholar
loisy
if
god
himself
wrote
the
bible
we
must
believe
him
to
be
either
ignorant
or
untruthful
as
he
delves
further
into
the
intricacies
of
the
construction
of
the
bible
our
visitor
perceives
that
the
old
testament
gradually
evolved
from
the
tenth
century
to
the
second
century
and
in
its
present
form
is
mainly
a
fifth
century
compilation
so
distorting
the
facts
that
it
has
taken
scholars
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
to
get
them
straight
it
may
rightly
be
said
that
there
is
not
a
single
book
in
the
bible
which
is
original
in
the
sense
of
having
been
written
by
one
man
for
all
the
books
are
made
up
of
older
documents
or
sources
which
were
combined
with
later
materials
undergoing
in
this
way
several
revisions
and
editions
at
the
hands
of
different
scribes
or
compilers
deep
traces
have
therefore
been
left
upon
the
text
of
the
bible
by
these
several
stages
of
expansions
additions
modifications
revisions
and
incorporations
they
appear
to
the
scholar
of
biblical
literature
much
like
the
striations
grooved
in
the
rocks
by
large
glaciers
to
the
student
of
geology
unravelling
the
book
of
the
martian
ascertains
that
to
most
thinking
men
it
has
become
very
obvious
that
the
bible
is
the
work
of
man
and
not
the
inspiration
of
a
god
that
an
increasing
number
of
liberal
theologians
are
discarding
the
theory
of
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
bible
he
likewise
clearly
perceives
that
there
are
as
yet
many
men
that
have
given
this
matter
but
little
thought
with
the
divine
inspiration
looming
up
as
a
corner
stone
in
the
hebrew
faith
he
realizes
that
it
behooves
him
to
carry
his
investigations
further
the
christians
accepting
the
old
testament
as
a
book
dictated
by
god
had
fixed
the
age
of
the
earth
as
the
harm
done
by
the
christian
ecclesiastics
in
attempting
to
force
science
to
conform
to
the
ridiculous
concept
of
the
construction
of
the
universe
as
contained
in
the
bible
and
as
interpreted
by
the
church
the
martian
considers
in
a
further
chapter
scientists
incline
to
the
view
that
the
earth
has
existed
as
a
separate
planet
for
something
like
two
thousand
million
years
the
rocks
give
a
history
of
just
as
in
the
study
of
the
origin
of
primitive
beliefs
one
finds
that
man
made
his
gods
and
invented
all
that
they
are
reported
to
have
said
so
a
study
of
the
old
testament
reveals
that
the
ancient
hebrew
invented
his
god
and
manufactured
the
vast
mass
of
myth
and
fable
that
are
recorded
as
the
words
and
deeds
of
god
throughout
the
ages
the
words
of
these
ancient
hebrews
have
been
taken
as
the
words
of
a
god
everything
goes
to
show
that
the
hebrew
literature
was
produced
like
other
literatures
hebrews
were
not
the
first
to
tell
tales
when
they
did
come
to
write
our
learning
they
borrowed
from
other
people
the
only
reason
why
anything
more
than
a
literary
attention
is
paid
to
these
old
jewish
writings
is
that
jesus
was
a
jew
when
christianity
was
founded
a
difficult
date
to
fix
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
bible
the
old
brahmans
and
buddhists
had
holy
scriptures
the
egyptians
had
a
book
of
the
dead
and
the
sayings
of
khuenaten
the
persians
had
the
the
chinese
had
sacred
books
they
were
all
as
sacred
as
the
jewish
books
priests
made
them
sacred
priests
generally
rewrote
and
edited
them
even
if
they
had
not
originally
imagined
them
there
is
nothing
to
guide
the
man
of
common
sense
save
knowledge
and
reason
every
priest
swears
his
religion
and
his
scriptures
are
true
but
they
can
not
all
be
true
if
the
first
are
true
then
the
jews
are
past
further
consideration
for
they
were
not
the
first
in
the
field
with
sacred
writings
holy
scriptures
are
merely
jewish
classics
we
have
had
to
accept
these
old
writings
of
the
hebrews
as
holy
and
inspired
because
the
priests
said
so
and
for
no
other
reason
whatsoever
there
is
no
other
reason
assuming
the
existence
of
a
deity
a
man
exercising
his
common
sense
would
be
compelled
to
deny
that
the
old
testament
is
inspired
of
god
because
it
abounds
in
stupidities
and
errors
such
as
no
god
could
inspire
but
because
the
jews
accumulated
these
writings
the
subsequent
adopters
of
christianity
realizing
that
jesus
was
a
jew
and
had
been
a
professing
jew
promptly
annexed
these
tales
of
fancy
and
of
fear
of
muddled
sensual
silly
things
and
said
they
must
be
accepted
with
the
teachings
of
jesus
and
in
the
course
of
time
people
had
to
believe
these
old
jewish
writings
were
the
word
of
god
williamson
thinker
or
the
hebrews
had
as
one
of
their
gods
yahveh
whom
they
endowed
with
their
qualities
qualities
inherent
in
a
primitive
people
jealousy
and
might
trickery
and
fickleness
they
evolved
a
worship
that
contained
in
a
modified
form
many
of
the
ceremonials
that
they
witnessed
when
they
came
into
contact
with
the
babylonians
and
phoenicians
their
bible
they
maintained
to
be
a
collection
of
books
which
appeared
at
intervals
with
divine
inspiration
during
a
thousand
years
of
jewish
history
similarly
they
insisted
that
moses
wrote
the
pentateuch
that
judges
kings
and
chronicles
go
back
to
the
times
they
describe
that
the
prophecies
were
added
from
the
ninth
century
onward
and
so
on
the
martian
found
that
not
a
single
book
of
the
old
testament
is
older
than
the
ninth
century
and
that
in
the
fifth
century
all
the
older
books
and
fragments
were
combined
together
into
the
old
testament
as
we
have
it
and
were
drastically
altered
so
as
to
yield
a
version
of
early
jewish
history
which
is
not
true
the
manipulation
of
the
hebrew
writings
by
the
jewish
priests
had
for
its
object
to
represent
the
jewish
priesthood
and
its
rights
and
customs
as
having
been
established
in
the
days
of
moses
deuteronomy
and
leviticus
have
been
classed
as
priestly
forgeries
nearly
every
occurrence
from
the
creation
of
the
world
to
the
death
of
moses
is
related
twice
and
in
some
cases
three
times
and
as
the
pentateuch
is
supposed
to
have
been
written
by
moses
one
must
assume
that
moses
had
double
and
triple
vision
chronicles
ezra
and
nehemiah
are
impudent
forgeries
of
the
fourth
century
giving
a
totally
false
version
of
the
events
the
martian
finds
that
the
terms
used
for
these
fabrications
are
redaction
or
recension
but
in
his
understanding
he
finds
the
word
most
descriptive
of
the
process
to
be
forgery
the
main
point
is
that
practically
all
the
experts
assure
you
that
in
scores
of
material
points
the
old
testament
history
has
been
discredited
and
has
only
been
confirmed
in
a
few
unimportant
incidental
statements
and
that
the
books
are
a
tissue
of
inventions
expansions
conflations
or
recensions
dating
centuries
after
the
event
the
martian
in
his
analysis
becomes
aware
of
instances
related
in
the
old
testament
that
on
his
planet
would
have
to
be
termed
forgeries
deliberate
falsifications
or
fabrications
of
documents
or
of
the
signature
to
them
now
the
far
greater
part
of
the
more
learned
clerical
authorities
on
the
bible
say
that
many
books
of
the
old
testament
pretend
to
be
written
by
men
who
did
not
write
them
that
many
books
were
deliberately
written
as
history
when
the
writers
knew
that
they
were
not
history
and
that
the
old
testament
as
a
whole
as
we
have
it
is
a
deliberate
attempt
to
convey
an
historical
belief
which
the
writers
knew
to
be
false
but
these
learned
authorities
do
not
like
the
word
forgery
it
is
crude
mccabe
the
forgery
of
the
old
testament
they
veil
the
meaning
of
this
word
in
the
elegance
the
subtlety
the
resources
of
diplomatic
language
they
talk
of
certain
books
in
terms
of
their
legendary
character
their
conformity
to
a
scheme
and
their
didactic
purpose
to
the
martian
these
are
but
an
extremely
polite
description
of
what
he
would
call
a
forgery
a
theologian
in
speaking
of
david
states
that
keen
criticism
is
necessary
to
arrive
at
the
kernel
of
fact
and
the
imaginative
element
in
the
story
of
david
is
but
the
vesture
which
half
conceals
half
discloses
certain
facts
treasured
in
popular
tradition
the
martian
thinks
this
is
polite
language
but
the
word
forgery
is
much
more
concise
and
to
the
point
and
he
finds
an
excellent
example
of
this
described
by
joseph
mccabe
in
the
forgery
of
the
old
testament
he
states
some
time
ago
we
recovered
tablets
of
the
great
persian
king
cyrus
and
professor
sayre
gives
us
a
translation
of
them
and
he
compares
them
as
you
may
with
the
words
of
daniel
that
night
was
belshazzar
the
king
of
the
chaldeans
slain
and
darius
the
median
took
the
kingdom
the
tablets
of
cyrus
describe
the
taking
of
babylon
and
are
beyond
the
slightest
suspicion
the
persians
had
adopted
the
babylonian
custom
of
writing
on
clay
then
baking
the
brick
or
tablet
and
such
documents
last
forever
and
these
and
other
authentic
and
contemporary
documents
of
the
age
which
describes
show
that
belshazzar
was
not
the
king
of
babylon
that
the
name
of
the
last
king
was
nabonidos
that
the
city
was
taken
peacefully
by
guile
not
by
bloodshed
that
it
was
cyrus
not
darius
the
median
who
took
it
that
darius
who
is
said
xi
by
daniel
to
have
been
the
son
of
ahasuerus
xerxes
was
really
his
father
that
all
the
babylonian
names
in
daniel
are
absurdly
misspelt
and
quite
strange
to
the
writer
that
the
writer
described
the
chaldeans
in
a
way
that
no
writer
could
have
done
before
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
it
is
now
beyond
question
that
the
man
who
wrote
daniel
and
pretended
to
be
alive
in
when
babylon
fell
did
not
live
until
three
or
four
centuries
later
the
book
is
a
tissue
of
errors
as
we
find
by
authentic
documents
and
by
reading
the
real
babylonian
names
on
the
tablets
the
martian
discovers
glaring
instances
of
forgery
in
the
book
of
isaiah
and
the
psalms
of
david
which
while
they
pretend
to
have
been
written
by
isaiah
and
david
are
really
compilations
by
various
writers
similarly
he
finds
that
the
book
of
esther
has
been
pronounced
by
scholars
as
a
clumsy
forgery
of
the
second
century
and
that
the
story
of
the
slaying
of
goliath
by
david
is
not
consistent
with
the
unlegendary
tradition
that
the
slayer
of
goliath
was
elhanan
and
the
period
of
this
adventure
not
in
saul
but
in
david
reign
the
book
of
psalms
although
attributed
to
king
david
was
not
written
by
king
david
and
the
book
of
proverbs
although
attributed
to
solomon
was
not
written
by
king
solomon
the
book
of
genesis
relates
the
mythical
traditions
of
the
hebrews
from
the
creation
of
the
world
to
the
death
of
joseph
a
french
physician
of
the
eighteenth
century
astruc
was
the
first
scholar
to
point
out
that
the
two
principal
designations
of
god
in
genesis
elohim
and
jahveh
are
not
used
arbitrarily
if
we
place
side
by
side
the
passages
in
which
god
is
called
elohim
and
those
in
which
he
is
called
by
the
other
name
we
get
two
perfectly
distinct
narratives
which
the
author
of
the
pentateuch
as
we
possess
it
has
juxtaposed
rather
than
fused
this
one
discovery
suffices
to
discredit
the
attribution
of
these
books
to
moses
who
could
not
have
been
an
unintelligent
compiler
and
also
discredits
the
theory
of
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
bible
text
a
comparison
of
the
two
narratives
shows
that
all
which
relates
to
the
creation
of
eve
the
garden
of
eden
and
adam
transgression
exists
only
in
the
jehovist
text
thus
it
is
evident
that
two
versions
of
the
creation
are
given
in
genesis
but
there
are
traces
in
the
old
testament
of
a
third
legend
akin
to
that
of
the
babylonians
in
which
marduk
creates
the
world
by
virtue
of
a
victory
over
the
waters
of
chaos
tiamat
this
conception
of
a
conflict
between
the
creator
and
hostile
forces
was
contrary
to
the
monotheistic
thesis
and
has
disappeared
from
our
two
versions
of
genesis
but
the
suppression
sufficiently
proves
that
it
was
very
ancient
and
had
long
been
accepted
the
martian
finds
that
theologians
have
attempted
to
crawl
out
of
desperate
situations
in
their
interpretation
of
the
old
testament
by
a
method
of
reading
into
a
passage
or
extracting
out
of
it
ideas
altogether
foreign
to
its
original
intent
this
method
they
call
allegory
by
means
of
this
process
they
have
been
able
to
extract
any
meaning
which
suits
their
purposes
and
by
this
method
of
juggling
could
prove
anything
a
classic
example
is
that
licentious
piece
of
literature
called
the
song
of
solomon
in
which
it
is
claimed
that
a
breasts
thighs
and
belly
are
the
symbols
of
the
union
of
jahveh
and
the
synagogue
continuing
his
researches
the
martian
notices
a
number
of
passages
in
the
old
testament
that
lead
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hebrews
were
originally
polytheists
the
name
elohim
he
finds
is
plural
singular
eloah
meaning
the
gods
again
in
another
passage
of
genesis
god
is
described
as
saying
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
i
and
further
on
the
man
is
become
as
one
of
us
it
becomes
evident
to
him
that
the
hebrews
like
their
neighbors
worshiped
baalim
or
the
gods
of
the
heathens
the
teraphim
the
etymology
of
which
is
unknown
were
little
portable
idols
which
seem
to
have
been
the
lares
of
the
ancient
hebrews
david
owned
some
i
samuel
xix
and
the
prophet
hosea
in
the
eighth
century
before
christ
seems
still
to
have
considered
the
teraphim
as
indispensable
in
worship
hos
iii
these
evidences
of
polytheism
and
fetichism
in
the
people
of
israel
destroy
in
the
mind
of
the
martian
the
claim
of
these
people
to
have
been
faithful
from
their
earliest
origin
to
a
spiritual
monotheism
rather
does
he
find
that
they
took
the
religions
of
other
peoples
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
the
old
testament
contains
numerous
instances
of
the
practice
of
magic
moses
and
aaron
were
magicians
who
rivalled
pharaoh
magicians
ex
vii
and
balaam
was
a
magician
who
pronounced
incantations
against
israel
and
afterwards
passed
over
to
the
service
of
jehovah
jacob
resorted
to
a
kind
of
sympathetic
magic
to
procure
the
birth
of
a
speckled
sheep
xxx
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
is
written
in
exodus
xxii
and
this
phrase
offered
an
affirmation
of
the
reality
of
witchcraft
during
the
period
of
the
witchcraft
delusion
the
martian
notes
that
the
sentence
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
has
caused
more
suffering
torture
and
death
than
probably
any
other
sentence
ever
framed
his
mind
revolts
at
the
stupidity
and
the
slavish
adherence
to
authority
of
the
human
mind
which
is
manifested
in
this
example
of
what
occurred
in
the
period
of
the
witchcraft
delusion
when
the
words
of
an
ignorant
and
barbaric
hebrew
were
taken
by
christian
followers
to
be
the
words
of
a
god
and
yet
our
martian
guest
recognizes
that
in
this
day
all
men
are
aware
of
the
fallacy
of
this
utterance
in
a
book
which
is
still
claimed
to
be
infallible
the
martian
then
considers
the
many
ancient
hebrew
rites
and
religious
taboos
that
have
come
down
through
the
ages
and
are
still
practiced
in
a
modified
form
by
the
modern
hebrew
thus
in
the
old
testament
there
are
numerous
instances
recorded
of
the
practices
of
slaughtering
of
innocent
animals
who
were
offered
as
peace
offerings
to
yahveh
as
time
passed
the
practice
of
slaughtering
and
then
burning
the
sacrificial
animal
gave
way
to
the
practice
of
only
giving
the
blood
of
the
animal
as
an
offering
this
custom
has
come
down
to
the
present
day
in
the
modern
worship
of
jehovah
the
blood
of
animals
is
still
forbidden
to
the
modern
hebrew
therefore
the
orthodox
jew
has
the
neck
of
the
chicken
slit
by
a
shochet
who
allows
the
blood
to
drip
to
the
ground
a
modern
blood
offering
to
the
gods
the
explanations
given
by
the
rabbis
of
our
day
are
spurious
similarly
the
orthodox
jew
of
our
time
still
persists
in
salting
the
meat
before
cooking
a
process
which
is
intended
to
remove
the
blood
which
is
the
portion
of
the
gods
the
reason
that
the
pious
jew
abstains
from
pork
leads
to
the
consideration
of
totemism
as
found
in
the
old
testament
totemism
is
a
kind
of
worship
rendered
to
animals
and
vegetables
considered
as
allied
and
related
to
man
the
worship
of
animals
and
plants
is
found
as
a
survival
in
all
ancient
societies
and
is
the
origin
of
the
belief
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
totemism
seems
to
have
been
as
widespread
as
the
animism
from
which
it
is
derived
and
has
been
closely
intertwined
in
the
development
of
religious
beliefs
totemism
in
a
modified
form
is
found
in
the
old
testament
where
animals
speak
on
occasion
as
the
serpent
in
genesis
or
balaam
ass
in
the
most
remote
periods
it
is
probable
that
every
clan
had
at
least
one
totem
animal
which
might
no
more
be
killed
or
eaten
than
the
human
individuals
of
the
clan
the
totem
was
protected
by
taboo
the
totem
was
sacred
and
in
this
capacity
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
source
of
strength
and
holiness
and
to
live
beside
it
and
under
its
protection
was
considered
as
a
righteous
custom
in
certain
communities
the
idea
that
it
was
necessary
to
abstain
from
eating
certain
totems
survived
the
progress
of
material
civilization
the
cow
is
taboo
to
the
hindus
the
pig
is
taboo
to
the
mohammedans
and
to
the
jews
the
pious
jew
abstains
from
pork
because
his
remote
ancestors
five
or
six
thousand
years
before
our
era
had
the
wild
boar
as
their
totem
this
is
the
origin
of
this
alimentary
taboo
among
the
ancient
hebrews
it
arose
and
only
comparatively
recently
has
it
been
suggested
that
the
flesh
of
these
taboo
animals
was
unwholesome
in
the
eighteenth
century
philosophers
propagated
the
erroneous
notion
that
if
certain
religious
legislators
had
forbidden
various
aliments
it
was
for
hygienic
motives
even
renan
believed
that
dread
of
trichinosis
and
leprosy
had
caused
the
hebrews
to
forbid
the
use
of
pork
to
show
the
irrational
nature
of
this
explanation
it
will
be
enough
to
point
out
that
in
the
whole
of
the
bible
there
is
not
a
single
instance
of
an
epidemic
or
a
malady
attributed
to
the
eating
of
unclean
meats
the
idea
of
hygiene
awoke
very
late
in
the
greek
world
to
the
biblical
writers
as
to
contemporary
savages
illness
is
supernatural
it
is
an
effect
of
the
wrath
of
spirits
primitive
man
ascribed
all
diseases
either
to
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
an
evil
being
the
curing
of
disease
by
the
casting
out
of
devils
and
by
prayers
were
the
means
of
relief
from
sickness
recognized
and
commanded
by
the
old
testament
the
hygienic
explanation
of
an
alimentary
prohibition
as
still
insisted
upon
by
the
rabbis
is
entirely
erroneous
and
marks
the
expounder
of
such
an
explanation
as
one
who
is
entirely
ignorant
of
the
evolution
of
religious
beliefs
the
entire
matter
is
well
stated
in
one
sentence
by
reinach
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
generally
speaking
than
to
explain
the
religious
laws
and
practices
of
the
remote
past
by
considerations
based
on
modern
science
the
martian
is
able
to
trace
some
curious
customs
that
were
exhibited
by
the
ancient
hebrews
as
well
as
most
other
ancient
peoples
and
which
have
persisted
to
this
day
the
customs
remain
the
same
the
meanings
have
become
lost
in
the
blind
adherence
to
custom
it
is
known
that
the
old
jewish
mourning
customs
originated
with
the
desire
for
protection
from
the
liberated
spirit
of
the
deceased
the
loud
cries
uttered
by
the
mourners
were
thought
to
frighten
away
the
spirits
the
change
of
dress
the
covering
of
the
head
with
ashes
and
the
shaving
of
the
hair
of
the
mourners
were
done
with
the
purpose
of
making
themselves
unrecognizable
to
the
spirits
hence
the
custom
still
prevails
of
wearing
the
mourning
veil
the
covering
of
mirrors
when
death
occurs
in
the
household
may
well
be
an
attempt
to
prevent
the
spirit
from
lingering
in
the
vicinity
similarly
even
today
the
orthodox
jew
in
case
of
grave
illness
in
his
family
changes
the
given
name
of
the
sufferer
to
confuse
the
evil
spirit
causing
the
disease
further
survivals
of
totemism
as
found
in
the
old
testament
are
illustrated
by
the
worship
of
the
bull
and
the
serpent
portable
gilded
images
of
bulls
were
consecrated
and
hosea
protested
against
the
worship
of
the
bull
in
the
kingdom
of
israel
hos
viii
x
the
famous
golden
calf
of
the
israelites
which
was
the
object
of
moses
anger
was
a
totemic
idol
the
worship
of
the
serpent
was
practiced
by
moses
himself
num
xxi
a
brazen
serpent
was
worshiped
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
and
was
only
destroyed
by
hezekiah
about
kings
xviii
the
ancient
hebrews
as
well
as
their
neighbors
were
phallic
worshipers
to
primitive
people
it
is
but
a
natural
phase
to
have
the
phallus
become
the
exponent
of
creative
power
and
as
such
to
be
worshiped
to
these
primitive
minds
there
was
nothing
immoral
in
genuine
phallic
worship
signs
of
phallicism
among
the
ancient
hebrews
can
be
clearly
pointed
out
the
serpent
was
a
phallic
symbol
that
the
serpent
was
the
phallus
is
proved
by
the
bible
itself
the
hebrew
word
used
for
serpent
is
which
is
everywhere
else
translated
in
the
bible
in
a
phallic
sense
as
in
ezekiel
xvi
where
it
is
rendered
in
the
sense
of
exposure
like
the
thy
boseth
naked
of
micah
hannay
christianity
the
sources
of
its
teaching
and
symbolism
the
ark
itself
was
a
feminine
symbol
and
phallicism
would
explain
why
moses
made
an
ark
and
put
in
it
a
rod
and
two
stones
the
eduth
the
shechina
the
tsur
and
the
yahveh
were
identical
simply
different
names
for
the
same
thing
the
phallus
they
occupied
the
female
ark
with
which
they
formed
the
double
sexed
life
symbol
the
hebrew
religion
had
thus
a
purely
phallic
basis
as
was
to
be
expected
from
a
ritual
and
symbolism
derived
from
two
extremely
phallic
nations
babylon
and
egypt
hannay
an
intelligent
reading
of
exodus
xxxiv
and
kings
xiv
and
will
prove
the
above
contention

our
martian

besieged
by

nauseated
him
the
hebrew
zealot
observing
the
utter
disgust
with
which
the
reader
was
regarding
his
revelation
is
obliged
to
explain
to
the
bewildered
barbarian
unbeliever
that
the
old
testament
is
the
foundation
for
all
of
our
morals
and
that
without
it
we
would
have
developed
into
a
very
shocking
and
immoral
race
since
the
visitor
wishes
to
remain
courteous
he
proceeds
but
with
a
great
deal
of
hesitation
to
further
examine
the
revelation
of
god
at
this
point
he
is
assured
that
this
work
is
read
in
most
schools
and
taught
to
small
children
however
our
guest
is
again
disillusioned
for
no
sooner
does
he
arrive
at
genesis
xii
than
he
finds
that
abraham
good
abraham
the
pure
the
father
of
all
hebrews
makes
of
the
sacred
relationship
of
marriage
a
means
of
personal
gain
and
safety
by
betraying
his
own
wife
now
it
is
the
martian
turn
to
inquire
of
the
hebrew
whether
the
latter
had
ever
read
this
story
to
his
own
daughter
or
the
story
of
abraham
affair
with
hagar
his
handmaiden
was
the
hebrew
young
daughter
aware
that
isaac
son
of
abraham
was
as
ready
and
willing
to
prostitute
his
wife
for
protection
for
himself
as
was
his
father
abraham
the
martian
is
puzzled
by
the
word
sporting
in
genesis
xxvi
and
is
informed
of
its
meaning
a
few
moments
after
reading
genesis
xix
he
informs
his
converter
that
if
lot
had
lived
in
mars
and
had
offered
his
daughters
to
appease
the
mob
the
account
of
that
incident
would
never
have
found
its
way
into
any
work
on
morals
moreover
he
failed
utterly
to
see
how
the
account
of
lot
daughters
getting
him
into
a
drunken
state
followed
by
a
statement
such
as
thus
were
both
the
daughters
of
lot
with
child
by
their
father
could
ever
have
any
moral
value
the
story
of
jacob
leah
and
rachel
does
not
appeal
to
this
infidel
martian
since
he
still
believes
that
integrity
and
faithfulness
are
virtues
yet
in
his
endeavor
to
respect
the
courtesy
due
to
his
host
he
reaches
for
pencil
and
pad
and
notes
the
various
moral
lessons
he
had
derived
thus
far
from
the
old
testament
he
wrote
lust
incest
infidelity
and
prostitution
arriving
at
the
story
of
dinah
genesis
xxxiv
he
wrote
that
in
addition
to
those
vices
already
listed
rape
should
be
given
a
prominent
place
the
stories
of
joseph
and
potiphar
wife
judah
and
tamar
king
david
and
his
wives
the
rape
of
tamar
by
her
brother
ammon
did
not
impress
the
martian
as
stories
for
the
delectation
of
children
since
he
was
crude
enough
to
hold
that
anything
which
would
shock
the
mind
of
a
child
could
not
have
any
moral
value
and
would
thus
be
automatically
excluded
from
any
religion
he
therefore
returned
the
volume
to
the
hebrew
with
the
remark
that
as
an
adult
he
found
the
stories
of
de
maupassant
and
balzac
more
interesting
even
though
they
belonged
to
the
same
genre
our
guest
now
repaired
to
one
of
our
golf
courses
where
during
the
interval
of
a
few
hours
the
fresh
air
the
sunshine
and
exercise
dispelled
the
mental
nausea
which
the
reading
of
the
old
testament
had
occasioned
in
him
returning
to
his
quarters
he
is
approached
by
one
of
the
christian
brethren
and
the
new
testament
is
placed
in
his
hands
with
these
remarks
the
christian
recognizes
that
in
the
old
testament
the
jews
have
given
to
the
christian
world
its
greatest
heritage
the
fact
that
in
exchange
for
this
priceless
heritage
the
christians
have
given
to
the
jews
a
series
of
persecutions
unequaled
in
the
annals
of
human
warfare
is
explained
by
the
quality
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
that
naturally
manifests
itself
after
a
complete
conversion
to
the
precepts
the
old
testament
contains
the
first
revelations
of
god
the
new
testament
the
last
revelations
our
christian
brother
forgets
to
remind
the
visitor
that
the
difference
of
opinion
regarding
these
two
testaments
of
god
has
caused
more
sorrow
bloodshed
harm
devilment
misery
and
devastation
than
any
other
single
item
in
the
life
and
history
of
the
human
race
the
martian
is
hard
pressed
to
reconcile
the
fact
that
mohammedanism
six
hundred
years
after
the
appearance
of
christianity
triumphed
over
christianity
in
a
great
portion
of
the
earth
surface
yet
he
is
informed
that
christianity
is
religion
of
god
that
allah
made
the
mohammedans
jehovah
the
jews
the
trinity
the
christians
and
the
rest
of
the
believers
were
illegitimate
children
of
the
above
gods
was
the
only
conclusion
he
could
reach
in
a
few
moments
the
myth
of
christ
begins
to
unfold
itself
before
his
eyes
in
the
gospels
of
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
the
acts
of
the
apostles
and
the
apocalypse
he
finds
the
messianic
texts
which
are
supposed
to
prefigure
jesus
in
the
old
testament
have
all
been
either
misunderstood
or
deliberately
misinterpreted
the
most
celebrated
is
that
in
isaiah
vii
which
predicts
that
a
virgin
shall
bear
a
son
emmanuel
but
the
word
which
the
septuagint
rendered
virgin
means
in
hebrew
a
young
woman
and
this
passage
merely
deals
with
the
approaching
birth
of
a
son
to
the
king
or
the
prophet
himself
this
error
of
the
septuagint
is
one
of
the
sources
of
the
legend
relating
to
the
virginal
birth
of
jesus
as
early
as
the
second
century
the
jews
perceived
it
and
pointed
it
out
to
the
greeks
but
the
church
knowingly
persisted
in
the
false
reading
and
for
over
fifteen
centuries
she
has
clung
to
her
error
his
attentive
reading
convinces
him
that
not
one
of
the
gospels
is
the
work
of
an
eyewitness
to
the
scenes
recorded
a
little
side
investigation
reveals
that
there
were
a
great
many
writings
called
gospels
from
which
the
church
finally
adopted
four
guaranteeing
their
inspiration
and
absolute
veracity
no
doubt
because
they
were
in
favor
in
four
very
influential
churches
matthew
at
jerusalem
mark
at
rome
or
at
alexandria
luke
at
antioch
and
john
at
ephesus
moreover
what
the
gospels
tell
him
he
perceives
is
what
different
christian
communities
believed
concerning
jesus
between
the
years
and
in
matthew
xxvi
mark
xiv
and
luke
xxii
there
are
words
such
as
those
jesus
is
supposed
to
have
uttered
during
the
slumber
of
these
very
same
apostles
this
occurrence
enlightens
him
as
to
what
augustine
meant
when
he
wrote
i
should
not
believe
in
the
gospel
if
i
had
not
the
authority
of
the
church
for
so
doing
if
the
documents
are
stuffed
with
the
authority
of
the
church
these
gospels
can
not
be
utilized
for
a
history
of
the
real
life
of
jesus
a
study
of
the
epistles
of
paul
reveals
that
paul
taught
that
sin
and
death
came
into
the
world
by
adam
fall
in
spite
of
a
diligent
search
the
martian
found
no
mention
of
this
in
the
words
ascribed
to
jesus
from
paul
utterances
he
learns
that
christ
came
to
redeem
mankind
by
his
voluntary
oblation
of
himself
he
was
the
son
of
god
paul
not
knowing
that
in
the
future
a
special
form
of
conception
would
be
superimposed
on
jesus
states
that
he
was
of
human
birth
the
martian
determined
to
ascertain
what
effect
the
teachings
of
paul
have
had
on
christianity
he
learns
that
ever
since
paul
the
ruling
idea
of
christianity
has
been
that
of
the
redemption
of
man
guilty
of
a
prehistoric
fault
by
the
voluntary
sacrifice
of
a
superman
this
doctrine
is
founded
upon
that
of
expiation
a
guilty
person
must
suffer
to
atone
for
his
fault
and
that
of
the
substitution
of
victims
the
efficacious
suffering
of
an
innocent
person
for
a
guilty
one
both
are
at
once
pagan
and
jewish
ideas
they
belong
to
the
old
fundamental
errors
of
humanity
yet
plato
knew
that
the
punishment
inflicted
on
a
guilty
person
is
not
nor
should
it
be
a
vengeance
it
is
a
painful
remedy
imposed
on
him
for
his
own
benefit
and
that
of
society
at
about
the
same
period
athenian
law
laid
down
the
principle
that
punishment
should
be
as
personal
as
the
fault
thus
paul
founded
christian
theology
on
two
archaic
ideas
which
had
already
been
condemned
by
enlightened
athenians
of
the
fourth
century
before
our
era
which
no
one
would
dream
of
upholding
in
these
days
though
the
structure
built
upon
them
still
in
chapter
v
of
the
first
epistle
of
john
these
words
strike
the
visitor
there
are
three
that
bear
witness
in
heaven
the
father
and
the
word
and
the
holy
ghost
and
these
three
are
one
if
these
two
verses
are
authentic
they
would
be
an
affirmation
of
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
dating
from
the
first
century
at
a
time
when
the
gospels
the
acts
and
paul
ignore
it
it
was
first
pointed
out
in
that
these
verses
were
an
interpolation
for
they
do
not
appear
in
the
best
manuscripts
notably
all
the
greek
manuscripts
down
to
the
fifteenth
century
the
roman
church
refused
to
bow
to
evidence
the
congregation
of
the
index
on
january
with
the
approbation
of
leo
xiii
forbade
any
question
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
text
relating
to
the
three
heavenly
witnesses
it
appeared
strange
to
the
martian
that
a
god
should
need
the
lies
of
his
disciples
to
be
incorporated
in
a
divine
revelation
but
his
confusion
was
even
greater
when
he
read
we
worship
one
god
in
trinity
and
trinity
in
unity
neither
confounding
the
persons
nor
dividing
the
substance
and
yet
they
are
not
three
eternals
but
one
eternal
not
three
almighties
but
one
almighty
so
the
father
is
god
the
son
god
and
the
holy
ghost
god
and
yet
they
are
not
three
gods
but
one
god
the
father
is
made
of
none
neither
created
nor
begotten
the
son
is
of
the
father
alone
not
made
nor
created
but
begotten
the
holy
ghost
is
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
neither
made
nor
created
nor
begotten
but
proceeding
and
in
this
trinity
none
is
afore
or
after
the
other
none
is
greater
or
less
than
another
but
the
whole
three
persons
are
coeternal
together
and
coequal
he
thought
this
would
make
a
great
puzzle
truly
an
insoluble
conundrum
to
take
back
to
bewilder
his
martian
friends
however
he
was
able
to
comprehend
the
remarks
of
vigilantius
who
returned
from
a
journey
in
italy
and
the
holy
land
disgusted
with
official
christianity
he
protested
vehemently
against
the
idolatrous
worship
of
images
the
legacy
of
paganism
to
the
church
a
practice
directly
opposed
to
that
of
the
mosaic
law
which
jesus
came
not
to
destroy
but
to
fulfill
it
was
idle
to
reply
that
these
images
were
the
scriptures
of
the
illiterate
that
they
were
not
the
object
of
but
the
stimulus
to
worship
experience
showed
that
the
majority
of
the
faithful
confounded
as
indeed
they
still
do
the
sign
with
the
thing
signified
reinach
orpheus
the
result
of
the
critical
examination
of
the
new
testament
by
the
martian
is
that
just
as
most
of
the
old
testament
books
are
not
only
anonymous
but
highly
composite
productions
that
as
certain
writings
traditionally
ascribed
to
moses
david
solomon
daniel
and
others
are
utterly
lacking
in
the
necessary
evidences
in
support
of
authorship
but
bear
unmistakable
evidence
of
having
gone
through
a
long
compilatory
process
so
does
each
gospel
despite
its
seeming
unity
give
evidence
of
being
a
composite
literary
product
scholars
have
agreed
that
mark
first
set
forth
the
doings
of
jesus
and
it
was
out
of
mark
that
both
matthew
and
luke
took
the
framework
of
their
own
writings
cleverly
fitting
into
its
arrangement
their
own
distinctive
material
and
coloring
the
whole
by
their
own
individual
treatment
unravelling
the
book
of
books
it
is
estimated
that
mark
was
written
shortly
before
the
romans
destroyed
jerusalem
in
this
means
that
a
chasm
of
or
years
separates
mark
written
document
from
the
ministry
of
jesus
a
long
enough
time
to
create
a
plastic
body
of
oral
teachings
and
a
highly
colored
tradition
embellished
with
fanciful
stories
luke
was
a
greek
physician
living
somewhere
on
the
shores
of
the
ægean
sea
he
had
been
a
friend
of
paul
just
as
mark
had
been
with
peter
luke
had
no
personal
acquaintance
with
jesus
and
had
to
get
his
information
from
what
others
said
or
from
what
the
friends
of
had
seen
the
gospel
of
matthew
is
an
anonymous
composition
which
on
analysis
has
been
found
to
incorporate
nearly
fifty
per
cent
of
what
is
found
in
mark
it
is
now
believed
by
many
scholars
to
have
been
written
between
the
years
and
at
antioch
not
of
course
by
the
apostle
matthew
but
by
some
unknown
editor
the
fourth
gospel
the
gospel
of
john
is
vastly
different
in
style
arrangement
and
in
the
description
of
the
words
actions
and
general
spiritual
character
of
jesus
many
scholars
believe
that
it
was
written
in
the
city
of
ephesus
somewhere
around
the
year
church
tradition
ascribed
it
to
the
apostle
john
the
son
of
zebedee
one
of
the
fishermen
whom
jesus
called
to
be
a
disciple
years
ago
this
view
was
easily
entertained
but
there
now
exists
too
much
refractory
evidence
against
assigning
this
greek
gospel
to
an
galilean
that
an
untutored
fisherman
could
have
written
so
elaborate
and
so
highly
philosophical
an
account
of
jesus
has
always
presented
a
thorny
problem
and
so
to
most
scholars
john
authorship
of
the
fourth
gospel
is
unthinkable
not
one
of
the
gospels
is
the
work
of
an
eyewitness
and
the
four
gospels
do
not
complete
each
other
they
contradict
each
other
and
when
they
do
not
contradict
they
repeat
each
other
the
christ
of
john
is
a
totally
different
person
from
the
christ
of
mark
matthew
and
luke
loisy
in
his
states
if
there
is
one
thing
above
others
that
is
obvious
but
as
to
which
the
most
powerful
of
theological
interests
have
caused
a
deliberate
or
unconscious
blindness
it
is
the
profound
the
irreducible
incompatibility
of
the
synoptical
gospels
and
the
fourth
gospel
if
jesus
spoke
and
acted
as
he
is
said
to
have
spoken
and
acted
in
the
first
three
gospels
he
did
not
speak
and
act
as
he
is
reported
to
have
done
in
the
fourth
the
martian
is
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
testament
with
its
version
of
the
virgin
birth
elizabeth
the
cousin
of
mary
zacharias
and
the
angel
gabriel
jesus
and
the
sinner
are
on
par
with
the
eroticism
of
the
old
testament
the
interpolations
the
myth
and
fable
also
compare
with
the
first
revelation
and
in
his
opinion
he
prefers
andersen
fairy
tales
or
æsop
fables
meanwhile
a
protestant
brother
mentions
the
name
of
luther
and
the
conclusions
he
draws
are
that
the
exciting
cause
of
the
reformation
was
an
extravagant
sale
of
indulgences
conceded
to
the
german
dominicans
the
augustinians
grew
jealous
of
the
dominicans
and
an
augustinian
monk
martin
luther
affixed
to
the
door
of
wittenberg
cathedral
articles
against
the
abuse
of
indulgences
this
started
the
fray
in
germany
with
luther
at
the
head
of
this
heresy
the
gravest
difference
of
opinion
had
to
do
with
the
communion
luther
retained
of
the
mystery
and
rejected
the
other
half
he
confesses
that
the
body
of
jesus
christ
is
in
the
consecrated
element
but
it
is
he
says
as
fire
is
in
the
iron
the
fire
and
the
iron
subsist
together
this
is
what
they
called
impanation
invination
consubstantiation
thus
while
those
they
called
papists
ate
god
without
bread
the
lutherans
ate
god
and
bread
soon
afterwards
came
the
calvinists
who
ate
bread
and
did
not
eat
god
in
short
luther
was
in
harmony
with
the
roman
church
in
nothing
but
the
doctrines
of
the
trinity
baptism
the
incarnation
and
the
resurrection
luther
thought
it
was
time
to
abolish
private
mass
he
pretended
the
devil
had
appeared
to
him
and
reproached
him
for
saying
mass
and
consecrating
the
elements
the
devil
had
proved
to
him
he
said
that
it
was
idolatry
luther
declared
that
the
devil
was
right
and
must
be
believed
the
mass
was
abolished
in
wittenberg
and
soon
afterwards
throughout
saxony
the
images
were
thrown
down
monks
and
nuns
left
their
cloisters
and
a
few
years
later
luther
married
a
nun
called
catharine
von
bora
this
tale
did
not
greatly
impress
our
guest
a
catholic
brother
not
to
be
outdone
extols
the
glories
of
his
universal
church
and
the
martian
again
sets
out
to
investigate
this
time
he
finds
the
quotations
in
the
new
testament
which
the
catholic
creed
interprets
as
giving
divine
authority
to
its
representatives
on
earth
is
a
late
interpolation
the
trinity
as
stated
above
is
a
paradox
which
no
rational
being
can
understand
and
its
dogmas
and
idolatry
are
consistent
with
a
civilization
of
years
ago
a
study
of
the
lives
of
its
popes
put
to
shame
the
statement
that
they
could
possibly
be
the
earthly
representatives
of
a
benevolent
being
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
the
papacy
passed
through
a
period
of
shameful
disorder
the
rome
of
john
x
was
a
cloaca
in
which
the
popes
set
the
example
of
the
worst
misconduct
for
a
good
short
account
of
the
lives
of
the
popes
see
draper
history
of
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
during
the
complete
control
by
the
church
of
civilization
in
europe
it
has
retarded
the
progress
of
humanity
for
at
least
years
and
its
precepts
and
fundamental
principles
are
today
detrimental
to
the
advance
of
mankind
it
has
to
its
credit
a
long
series
of
judicial
murders
for
differences
of
opinion
the
crusades
instigated
by
the
popes
and
seconded
by
the
monks
cost

lives
and
exhausted
the
resources
of

europe
they
aggravated
fanaticism
exaggerated
the
worship
of

and

to

point
of
mania
and
encouraged

abuse
of
and

in
indulgences
there
had
never
been
a
single
opinion
persecuted
by
the
church
in
the
middle
ages
the
adoption
of
which
would
not
have
brought
about
a
diminution
of
her
revenues
the
church
has
always
primarily
considered
her
finances
the
papacy
was
responsible
for
the
inquisition
and
it
actively
encouraged
and
excited
its
ferocity
it
gave
birth
to
the
witchcraft
mania
the
first
grand
inquisitor
torquemada
received
the
congratulations
of
the
pope
it
diabolically
applauded
the
bartholomew
massacre
and
instigated
the
numerous
religious
wars
that
tore
europe
asunder
and
was
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
and
incalculable
suffering
with
such
savage
alacrity
did
it
carry
out
its
object
of
protecting
the
interests
of
religion
that
between
and
it
had
punished
three
hundred
and
forty
thousand
persons
and
of
these
nearly
had
been
burnt
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
the
catholic
church
has
taught
and
still
teaches
that
intellectual
liberty
is
dangerous
that
it
should
be
forbidden
it
was
driven
to
take
this
position
because
it
had
taken
another
it
taught
and
still
teaches
that
a
certain
belief
is
necessary
to
salvation
it
has
always
known
that
investigation
and
inquiry
led
or
might
lead
to
doubt
that
doubt
leads
or
may
lead
to
heresy
and
that
heresy
leads
to
hell
in
other
words
the
catholic
church
has
something
more
important
than
this
world
more
important
than
the
of
man
here
it
regards
this
life
as
an
opportunity
for
joining
that
church
for
accepting
that
creed
and
for
the
saving
of
your
soul
if
the
history
of
the
world
proves
anything
if
proves
that
the
catholic
church
was
for
many
centuries
the
most
merciless
institution
that
ever
existed
among
men
we
too
know
that
the
catholic
church
was
during
all
the
years
of
its
power
the
enemy
of
every
science
it
preferred
magic
to
medicine
relics
to
remedies
priests
to
physicians
it
hated
geologists
persecuted
the
chemists
and
imprisoned
the
naturalists
and
opposed
every
discovery
of
science
calculated
to
improve
the
condition
of
mankind
there
is
no
crime
that
the
catholic
church
did
not
commit
no
cruelty
that
it
did
not
reward
and
no
virtue
that
it
did
not
persecute
it
was
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
enemy
of
human
rights
in
one
hand
it
carried
an
alms
dish
and
in
the
other
a
dagger
it
argued
with
the
sword
persecuted
with
poison
and
convicted
with
faggot
ingersoll
or
from
the
time
of
newton
to
our
own
day
the
divergence
of
science
from
the
dogmas
of
the
church
has
steadily
increased
the
church
declared
that
the
earth
is
the
central
and
most
important
body
in
the
universe
that
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
are
tributary
to
it
on
these
points
she
was
worsted
by
astronomy
she
affirmed
that
a
universal
deluge
had
covered
the
earth
that
the
only
surviving
animals
were
such
as
had
been
saved
in
the
ark
in
this
her
error
was
established
by
geology
she
taught
that
there
was
a
first
man
who
some
or
years
ago
was
suddenly
created
or
called
into
existence
in
a
condition
of
physical
and
moral
perfection
and
from
that
condition
he
fell
but
anthropology
has
shown
that
human
beings
existed
far
back
in
geological
time
and
in
a
savage
state
but
little
better
than
that
of
the
brute
convicted
of
so
many
errors
the
papacy
makes
no
attempt
at
explanation
it
ignores
the
whole
matter
nay
more
relying
on
the
efficacy
of
audacity
although
confronted
by
these
facts
it
lays
claim
to
infallibility
the
persecutions
of
bruno
galileo
and
copernicus
together
with
the
facts
hitherto
stated
did
not
impress
the
martian
with
the
infallibility
of
the
church
the
only
great
spiritual
power
that
could
have
interposed
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
the
world
war
was
the
papacy
pope
pius
x
had
his
nuncio
admonish
the
austrian
emperor
but
he
failed
even
to
get
an
audition
from
that
old
imbecile
the
next
pope
benedict
xv
was
under
the
influence
of
a
majority
of
cardinals
he
strove
to
remain
neutral
he
attempted
to
solace
the
belgians
with
words
but
he
did
not
reprove
the
murderous
invaders
he
protested
against
the
new
and
devilish
methods
of
warfare
but
he
did
not
condemn
he
did
not
excommunicate
those
that
used
them
had
the
papacy
lost
its
power
of
commanding
kings
and
nations
and
had
it
lost
its
greatest
threat
a
threat
which
hitherto
could
have
thrown
the
masses
of
its
adherents
into
a
panic
the
threat
of
excommunication
no
the
papacy
still
blessed
the
banners
of
the
armies
just
as
it
did
during
the
middle
ages
and
sent
its
adherents
out
to
slaughter
but
first
took
great
care
that
the
minds
of
the
devout
be
completely
drugged
with
the
poison
of
its
creed
a
creed
that
told
its
followers
that
do
what
you
might
no
matter
how
dastardly
that
act
might
be
so
long
as
you
repent
and
confess
your
sins
life
everlasting
will
be
the
reward
what
is
the
value
of
a
church
that
has
claimed
the
moral
leadership
of
the
world
when
such
things
can
happen
now
that
the
martian
has
become
acquainted
with
the
three
major
religions
which
dominate
the
world
judaism
christianity
and
mohammedanism
and
has
been
amazed
and
shocked
at
the
significance
of
their
teachings
in
the
history
of
civilization
his
curiosity
is
further
aroused
and
he
decides
to
obtain
some
information
of
the
respective
personalities
responsible
for
the
amassing
of
devotees
to
these
creeds
all
infallible
and
all
detrimental
to
progress
this
time
his
interest
leads
him
to
ancient
and
contemporary
sources
of
a
literal
rather
than
verbal
nature
sources
dealing
with
the
three
most
influential
prophets
in
the
history
of
mankind
jesus
moses
and
mohammed
chapter
iii
the
prophets
mohammed
jesus
and
moses
charlatans
or
victims
of
mental
and
physical
disease
prophet
or
seer
is
a
man
of
strong
imaginative
powers
which
have
not
been
calmed
by
education
the
ideas
which
occur
to
his
mind
often
present
themselves
to
his
eyes
and
ears
in
corresponding
sights
and
sounds
prophets
have
existed
in
all
countries
and
at
all
times
but
the
gift
becomes
rare
in
the
same
proportion
as
people
learn
to
read
and
winwood
reade
religious
apologists
are
forever
reminding
us
that
we
must
interpret
both
the
lives
and
the
works
of
their
prophets
and
recorders
in
the
spirit
and
meaning
of
the
ages
in
which
they
lived
to
this
i
agree
but
the
apologists
have
so
mutilated
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
seers
and
built
about
them
such
a
mass
of
nonsense
myth
and
fable
that
it
becomes
nearly
impossible
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
to
differentiate
the
actual
man
from
the
fabled
man
but
there
are
certain
facts
that
do
come
down
to
us
recorded
by
disinterested
observers
from
which
can
be
derived
finally
some
conception
of
their
mode
of
life
and
the
content
and
significance
of
their
teachings
although
time
causes
great
changes
in
customs
and
manners
it
only
effects
a
negligible
variation
in
the
vast
majority
of
diseases
which
affect
the
body
and
mind
of
man
we
know
from
the
examination
of
the
skeletal
remains
of
prehistoric
man
that
the
diseases
of
the
bone
of
thousands
of
years
ago
were
similar
in
their
manifestations
to
those
same
diseases
of
bone
of
today
from
the
writings
of
the
early
egyptian
greek
and
roman
physicians
we
identify
diseases
by
their
symptoms
and
recognize
that
the
symptoms
of
these
diseases
have
not
changed
throughout
the
ages
therefore
with
the
knowledge
of
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
various
diseases
which
we
have
today
we
can
safely
assert
that
if
an
ancient
complained
of
the
same
group
of
signs
and
symptoms
which
is
now
termed
a
disease
complex
he
was
suffering
from
the
same
disease
which
we
can
identify
in
modern
man
what
applies
to
physical
disease
is
just
as
applicable
to
mental
disease
in
speaking
of
mental
disease
it
is
important
for
the
layman
to
keep
in
mind
a
few
fundamental
principles
held
by
the
physician
the
physician
in
speaking
of
mental
disease
means
a
more
or
less
permanent
departure
from
the
normal
or
usual
way
of
thinking
acting
or
feeling
in
the
examination
of
a
patient
with
mental
disease
the
physician
looks
for
delusions
illusions
and
hallucinations
a
delusion
is
a
false
belief
concerning
which
the
individual
who
holds
it
is
unable
to
admit
evidence
such
as
would
be
admitted
by
ordinary
individuals
an
illusion
is
a
deception
of
the
senses
a
misinterpretation
of
sensory
impressions
the
normal
person
can
be
convinced
of
this
deception
the
mirage
for
example
is
an
optical
illusion
which
has
a
starting
point
in
an
external
stimulus
a
hallucination
is
a
deception
of
any
of
the
five
senses
in
which
there
is
no
starting
point
but
it
is
fabricated
in
a
disordered
mind
illustrations
of
hallucinations
are
the
hearing
of
voices
when
none
are
present
smelling
of
odors
the
seeing
of
visions
in
a
vacuum
with
the
elementary
understanding
of
fundamental
symptoms
of
mental
diseases
as
a
point
of
departure
let
us
consider
the
cases
of
mohammed
jesus
and
moses
three
of
the
most
influential
prophets
in
the
history
of
civilization
mohammed
of
the
three
mohammed
should
be
considered
before
the
others
for
several
reasons
first
there
is
no
question
regarding
the
actual
existence
of
mohammed
we
know
that
he
was
born
at
mecca
about
and
died
at
medina
on
june
from
the
facts
of
his
life
and
the
religion
which
he
founded
we
are
able
to
see
the
manner
in
which
legend
and
superstition
were
superimposed
on
its
original
simple
form
the
historical
records
of
his
life
and
teachings
are
easier
of
access
since
he
is
nearer
our
time
than
the
other
two
prophets
and
we
can
get
a
better
understanding
of
his
character
it
was
gibbon
who
said
it
may
be
expected
that
i
should
balance
his
faults
and
his
virtues
that
i
should
decide
whether
the
title
of
enthusiast
or
impostor
more
properly
belongs
to
that
extraordinary
man
at
the
distance
of
twelve
centuries
i
darkly
contemplate
his
shade
through
a
cloud
of
incense
in
attempting
to
peer
through
this
cloud
of
religious
incense
we
find
the
following
facts
in
the
city
of
mecca
probably
in
august
in
the
year
mohammed
the
prophet
of
allah
was
born
there
seems
little
doubt
that
he
was
descended
from
those
lofty
koreish
whose
opposition
which
at
first
nearly
succeeded
in
holding
his
name
in
perpetual
oblivion
eventually
caused
him
to
emerge
into
the
light
of
deathless
fame
his
birth
was
surrounded
by
all
manner
of
signs
and
omens
we
are
told
the
labor
of
his
mother
amina
was
entirely
painless
earthquakes
loosed
the
bases
of
mountains
and
caused
great
bodies
of
water
whose
names
were
unfortunately
not
specified
to
wither
away
or
overflow
the
sacred
fire
of
zoroaster
which
under
the
jealous
care
of
the
magi
had
spouted
ceaseless
flames
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
was
extinguished
all
the
idols
in
the
world
except
the
kaaba
tumbled
to
earth
immediately
after
the
babe
was
born
an
ethereal
light
dazzled
the
surrounding
territory
and
on
the
very
moment
when
his
eyes
were
first
opened
he
lifted
them
to
heaven
and
exclaimed
god
is
great
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
i
am
his
prophet
all
these
poetic
fancies
have
been
appropriately
denounced
by
christian
scribes
who
have
claimed
that
nature
would
never
have
dignified
the
birth
of
a
pagan
like
mohammed
with
such
marvelous
prodigies
as
undoubtedly
attended
the
advent
of
christ
however
mohammed
was
born
shortly
after
the
death
of
his
father
at
the
age
of
six
his
mother
died
also
and
he
spent
the
first
ten
years
among
the
bedouins
under
the
care
of
a
named
halima
at
the
age
of
four
it
was
noticed
that
the
child
had
signs
of
convulsive
seizures
which
later
commentators
thought
were
of
an
epileptic
nature
he
was
brought
up
under
the
care
of
his
uncle
abu
talib
and
his
early
manhood
was
spent
in
caring
for
the
flock
and
in
attending
caravan
expeditions
when
the
prophet
was
years
old
his
uncle
secured
for
him
a
position
with
a
caravan
owned
by
a
wealthy
widow
khadija
thanks
to
mohammed
keen
business
sense
the
caravan
was
highly
successful
and
he
was
induced
to
personally
report
his
success
to
khadija
that
lady
a
wealthy
widow
of
forty
years
and
the
mother
of
three
children
was
highly
pleased
at
mohammed
story
as
she
listened
to
the
proof
of
his
business
ability
and
fondly
scanned
his
large
nobly
formed
head
his
curling
hair
his
piercing
eyes
and
his
comely
form
it
naturally
occurred
to
her
that
this
vigorous
and
handsome
young
fellow
would
make
an
excellent
successor
to
her
deceased
husband
she
had
her
way
and
they
were
married
during
the
next
fifteen
years
mohammed
led
a
tranquil
life
his
future
was
provided
for
and
he
had
plenty
of
leisure
to
occupy
himself
as
he
chose
in
these
years
mohammed
and
his
wife
continued
to
be
conventional
worshipers
of
idols
who
nightly
performed
rites
in
honor
of
various
gods
and
goddesses
among
whom
were
allah
and
his
female
consoler
and
so
by
the
year
mohammed
at
the
age
of
forty
was
nothing
more
than
a
respectable
but
unknown
tradesman
who
had
experienced
no
extraordinary
crises
whose
few
existing
utterances
were
dull
and
insipid
and
whose
life
seemed
destined
to
remain
as
insignificant
and
unsung
as
any
other
arab
at
this
time
he
began
to
retire
for
days
at
a
time
to
a
cave
in
the
foothills
of
mount
hira
a
hill
several
miles
north
of
mecca
meanwhile
his
business
languished
as
the
months
passed
he
still
continued
to
act
in
the
same
incomprehensible
manner
it
was
noticed
that
little
by
little
certain
members
of
his
immediate
family
attended
him
to
his
refuge
or
gathered
with
him
in
some
one
of
their
houses
this
continued
for
several
years
until
it
was
rumored
that
mohammed
the
camel
driver
was
confidently
claiming
the
honor
of
having
made
a
great
discovery
namely
that
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
by
what
process
of
thought
had
mohammed
come
to
exalt
allah
not
merely
above
all
arabian
gods
but
above
the
gods
of
all
times
furthermore
why
was
he
so
certain
of
his
own
intimate
association
with
allah
we
can
understand
this
if
we
consider
mohammed
in
the
light
of
a
victim
of
mental
disease
one
account
informs
us
that
as
mohammed
was
wandering
near
the
cave
at
mount
hira
an
angel
from
the
sky
cried
to
him
mohammed
i
am
gabriel
he
was
terrified
and
hurried
home
to
impart
his
experience
to
his
wife
i
see
a
light
he
said
to
his
wife
and
i
hear
a
sound
i
fear
that
i
am
possessed
this
idea
was
most
distressing
to
a
pious
man
he
became
pale
haggard
he
wandered
about
on
the
hill
near
mecca
crying
for
help
to
god
more
than
once
he
drew
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
was
tempted
to
hurl
himself
down
and
so
put
an
end
to
his
misery
at
once
he
lived
much
in
the
open
air
gazing
on
the
stars
watching
the
dry
ground
grow
green
beneath
the
gentle
rain
he
pondered
also
on
the
religious
legends
of
the
jews
which
he
had
heard
related
on
his
journeys
and
as
he
looked
and
thought
the
darkness
was
dispelled
the
clouds
disappeared
and
the
vision
of
god
in
solitary
grandeur
rose
within
his
mind
and
there
came
upon
him
an
impulse
to
speak
of
god
there
came
upon
him
a
belief
that
he
was
a
messenger
of
god
sent
on
earth
to
restore
the
religion
of
abraham
which
the
pagan
arabs
had
polluted
with
idolatry
the
jews
in
corrupting
their
holy
books
at
the
same
time
he
heard
a
voice
and
sometimes
he
felt
a
noise
in
his
ears
like
the
tinkling
of
bells
or
a
low
deep
hum
as
if
bees
were
swarming
round
his
head
at
this
period
of
his
life
the
chapters
of
the
koran
were
delivered
in
throes
of
pain
the
paroxysms
were
preceded
by
depression
of
spirit
his
face
became
clouded
his
extremities
turned
cold
he
shook
like
a
man
in
an
ague
and
he
called
for
coverings
his
face
assumed
an
expression
horrible
to
see
the
vein
between
his
eyebrows
became
distended
his
eyes
were
fixed
his
head
moved
to
and
fro
as
if
he
was
conversing
and
then
he
gave
forth
the
oracle
or
sura
the
hitherto
mentally
and
emotionally
normal
trader
husband
and
father
was
thus
suddenly
swept
off
his
feet
and
carried
irresistibly
away
on
a
mighty
tide
his
perturbed
spirit
now
soared
to
the
heights
of
heaven
now
plunged
into
the
chasms
of
hell
moments
of
ethereal
bliss
would
be
followed
by
periods
of
profoundest
melancholy
it
is
related
that
the
angel
gabriel
who
thus
far
had
labored
only
in
the
field
of
christian
endeavor
was
chosen
by
allah
as
bearer
of
the
divine
revelation
to
mohammed
one
day
while
the
was
wrestling
with
his
doubts
among
the
foothills
of
mount
hira
he
saw
a
wondrous
apparition
floating
downward
on
celestial
wings
art
god
prophet
and
i
am
gabriel
announced
the
guest
before
he
departed
to
receive
the
blessing
of
allah
for
having
so
successfully
executed
the
heavenly
command
gabriel
was
a
very
valuable
ambassador
for
through
the
journeying
of
this
indefatigable
messenger
allah
was
able
to
remain
at
ease
in
heaven
thus
keeping
up
the
appearance
of
intangible
majestic
remoteness
so
necessary
for
dignified
gods
and
thus
mohammed
came
into
his
own
from
that
moment
mohammed
looked
upon
himself
as
allah
vice
regent
through
whom
allah
incontestable
decrees
were
to
be
given
to
man
mohammed
every
doubt
had
now
vanished
his
soul
was
completely
at
ease
and
from
his
lips
there
burst
the
wildly
exultant
chant
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
the
obliging
gabriel
he
said
had
borne
him
on
a
winged
steed
over
medina
to
the
temple
of
jerusalem
and
from
there
he
continued
his
celestial
journey
until
he
was
carried
completely
out
of
this
world
to
those
ethereal
realms
of
bliss
where
the
seven
heavens
are
up
and
up
he
flew
while
he
carefully
noted
the
order
of
precedence
of
those
prophets
whose
model
he
had
proclaimed
himself
to
be
jesus
and
john
were
in
the
second
or
third
he
was
not
quite
sure
which
moses
was
in
the
sixth
while
abraham
alone
had
the
supreme
distinction
of
residing
in
the
seventh
heaven
there
at
the
apex
of
indescribable
glory
mohammed
had
entered
the
awful
presence
of
his
maker
who
after
some
charged
him
to
see
that
all
moslems
should
hereafter
prostrate
themselves
in
prayer
toward
the
temple
of
solomon
five
times
a
day
the
truth
of
this
narrative
rests
upon
two
solid
facts
from
that
day
to
this
all
devout
moslems
have
continued
to
bow
themselves
five
times
daily
in
prayer
and
sceptics
may
still
see
upon
the
rock
where
stands
the
mosque
of
omar
in
jerusalem
the
identical
print
of
the
foot
where
he
leaped
upon
the
heavenly
charger
his
thoughts
whether
conceived
in
a
white
heat
of
frenzy
or
with
deliberate
coolness
and
sly
calculations
for
the
main
chance
were
probably
not
written
down
in
any
definite
manner
during
his
lifetime
it
is
not
even
certain
whether
he
could
read
or
write
he
delighted
in
the
appellation
the
illiterate
prophet
possibly
on
account
of
his
humility
and
possibly
because
he
knew
that
inspired
ignorance
had
been
the
indisputable
prerogative
of
all
successful
prophets
in
the
past
indeed
the
very
fact
that
he
was
unlearned
was
rightly
supposed
to
increase
the
miraculous
nature
of
his
revelations
as
he
tossed
the
divine
emanations
from
his
lips
they
were
sometimes
recorded
by
hireling
scribes
upon
palm
leaves
leather
stones
the
shoulder
blades
or
ribs
of
camels
and
goats
but
often
they
were
not
immediately
written
down
at
all
the
prophet
would
go
around
spouting
forth
his
utterances
to
his
followers
who
trained
from
infancy
to
memorize
verses
and
songs
of
every
sort
with
infallible
precision
would
piously
commit
them
to
memory
such
is
the
koran
and
through
its
instrumentality
allah
the
wise
the
only
wise
revealed
his
immutable
decrees
to
the
good
the
rewards
of
a
paradise
that
utterly
beggared
the
christian
heaven
to
the
bad
the
punishments
of
a
hell
that
contained
an
infinity
of
such
refined
tortures
of
heat
and
even
of
cold
as
neither
the
most
imaginatively
gifted
jew
or
christian
had
yet
conceived
reinach
aptly
states
it
is
humiliating
to
the
human
intellect
to
think
that
this
mediocre
literature
has
been
the
subject
of
innumerable
commentaries
and
that
millions
of
men
are
still
wasting
time
in
absorbing
it
over
one
hundred
and
sixty
million
are
adherents
of
the
koran
in
an
objective
analysis
excluding
the
emotional
factors
of
religious
bias
mohammed
would
as
unquestionably
be
considered
a
victim
of
mental
disturbances
as
an
individual
living
in
our
own
day
and
manifesting
the
same
symptoms
mohammed
was
the
subject
of
illusions
hallucinations
and
delusions
he
had
suicidal
tendencies
and
he
had
alternating
periods
of
exhilaration
and
depression
to
simply
assert
that
he
was
an
epileptic
does
not
explain
these
symptoms
for
epileptics
can
not
throw
a
fit
at
will
however
we
know
that
ten
per
cent
of
epileptics
develop
mental
diseases
no
particular
psychosis
but
a
loss
of
mental
and
moral
sense
there
are
two
types
of
individuals
who
can
produce
seizures
such
as
mohammed
was
wont
to
evoke
at
will
one
type
is
the
hysterical
and
the
other
is
that
degraded
individual
who
for
the
sake
of
collecting
alms
will
place
a
piece
of
soap
in
his
mouth
enter
a
crowded
street
fall
to
the
ground
and
proceed
to
foam
at
the
mouth
and
twist
and
contort
himself
as
an
epileptic
does
that
is
the
charlatan
the
faker
and
that
brings
us
to
the
second
aspect
of
his
mohammed
character
outside
of
arabia
paganism
was
in
general
disrepute
the
dissolute
and
declining
romans
were
cracking
lewd
jokes
in
the
very
faces
of
their
gods
the
myriad
followers
of
confucius
buddha
and
zoroaster
were
either
too
remote
or
too
helpless
to
matter
in
one
way
or
another
talmudic
judaism
and
oriental
christianity
despised
idolatry
and
worshipped
the
same
jehovah
even
though
they
disputed
with
each
other
and
indeed
among
themselves
concerning
the
various
attributes
amorous
pursuits
and
lineal
descendants
of
the
godhead
now
to
one
who
chose
to
regard
himself
as
a
prophet
monotheism
had
distinct
advantages
over
polytheism
in
the
first
place
it
was
rather
confusing
to
attempt
to
obey
the
behests
of
conflicting
deities
in
the
second
place
the
different
prophets
of
jehovah
in
judaism
and
christendom
had
so
far
as
mohammed
knew
been
uniformly
successful
for
he
was
familiar
with
the
glorious
history
of
abraham
moses
and
david
and
he
always
held
to
the
perverse
conception
that
jesus
was
not
crucified
however
deep
in
the
dumps
prophets
may
have
been
on
occasion
they
have
invariably
believed
one
thing
victory
for
their
particular
cause
would
inevitably
come
neither
an
unbroken
series
of
worldly
failures
nor
the
chastisement
of
his
god
have
ever
shaken
the
faith
of
a
prophet
in
himself
or
as
he
would
doubtless
prefer
to
say
in
his
divinity
arabia
broken
unorganized
inglorious
idolistic
arabia
obviously
lacked
one
supreme
being
whose
prerogative
was
greater
than
all
other
supreme
beings
and
that
being
in
turn
needed
a
messenger
to
exploit
his
supremacy
the
messengers
who
had
served
jehovah
had
certainly
prospered
well
but
jehovah
himself
appeared
to
be
on
the
decline
his
unity
was
steadily
disintegrating
into
a
paradoxical
trinity
why
therefore
not
give
allah
the
leading
icon
in
arabia
an
opportunity
such
considerations
quite
probably
never
entered
the
head
of
mohammed
with
any
definiteness
yet
his
behavior
for
the
rest
of
his
days
seems
to
indicate
that
these
or
similar
conceptions
were
subconsciously
egging
him
on
of
certain
facts
moreover
he
was
definitely
aware
he
may
have
had
little
or
no
formal
education
but
his
memory
was
retentive
and
capacious
and
his
caravan
journeys
together
with
the
scores
of
conversations
he
had
held
at
the
yearly
fairs
as
well
as
at
mecca
with
many
cultivated
strangers
had
packed
his
mind
with
a
mass
of
highly
valuable
matter
in
these
ways
he
had
learned
both
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
the
jews
and
christians
their
fanatical
enthusiasm
and
despairs
their
spasmodic
attempts
to
proselytize
as
well
as
the
widespread
defection
from
their
faiths
since
his
conception
of
religion
was
largely
personal
for
he
looked
upon
moses
jesus
and
the
rest
of
the
prophets
as
merely
capable
men
who
had
founded
and
promulgated
religions
and
since
arabia
had
no
ruler
why
should
he
not
seize
the
reins
of
power
and
carry
on
the
great
tradition
of
prophethood
what
a
magnificent
opportunity
beckoned
and
how
fortunate
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
recognize
the
call
by
keeping
only
what
was
best
of
the
arabic
faith
the
kaaba
and
the
black
stone
and
by
a
judicious
selection
of
the
most
feasible
ideas
which
lay
imbedded
in
jewish
and
christian
precepts
he
might
establish
a
code
that
would
supersede
all
others
and
then
might
dictate
to
all
arabs
alike
what
prophets
had
done
he
would
also
do
and
do
better
such
are
the
thoughts
of
a
charlatan
and
demagogue
if
mohammed
actually
had
such
ideas
we
can
never
know
but
a
study
of
his
further
actions
and
conquests
surely
shows
that
he
must
have
had
something
of
the
same
trend
of
thought
in
mind
his
fits
before
the
oncoming
of
a
new
sura
have
been
mentioned
eventually
he
so
perfected
his
technique
that
he
could
throw
a
cataleptic
fit
and
produce
a
message
without
any
previous
preparation
he
would
drum
up
a
crowd
with
his
ludicrous
snortings
and
puffings
until
the
resounding
cry
inspiration
hath
descended
on
the
prophet
assured
him
that
he
had
a
sufficiently
large
audience
to
warrant
the
of
a
new
sura
while
in
a
room
that
was
obviously
empty
he
declared
that
all
seats
were
occupied
by
angels
he
cultivated
suave
and
benign
expression
he
flattered
and
astounded
his
followers
by
telling
them
facts
which
he
had
presumably
acquired
through
private
information
he
took
the
most
painstaking
care
of
his
person
painting
his
eyes
and
perfuming
his
entire
body
daily
and
wearing
his
hair
long
ayesha
one
of
the
prophet
wives
remarked
that
the
prophet
loved
three
things
women
scent
and
food
and
that
he
had
his
heart
content
of
the
first
two
but
not
of
the
last
in
fact
mohammed
himself
argued
that
these
two
innocuous
diversions
intensified
the
ecstasy
of
his
prayers
in
the
koran
description
of
heaven
so
much
emphasis
was
put
on
food
that
a
jolly
jew
objected
on
the
grounds
that
such
continual
feasting
must
of
necessity
be
followed
by
a
purgation
the
prophet
however
swore
that
it
would
not
even
be
necessary
to
blow
the
nose
in
paradise
since
all
bodily
impurities
would
be
carried
off
by
a
perspiration
as
odoriferous
as
musk
when
his
wife
khadija
was
dying
he
comforted
her
with
the
assurance
that
she
together
with
three
other
women
the
virgin
mary
potiphar
wife
and
kulthum
moses
sister
would
occupy
his
chamber
in
paradise
on
mohammed
escape
to
medina
a
long
series
of
holy
wars
began
which
like
all
holy
wars
were
characterized
by
extreme
brutality
the
koran
of
the
period
contains
such
pacific
doctrines
as
these
the
sword
is
the
key
of
heaven
and
hell
a
drop
of
blood
shed
in
the
cause
of
god
a
night
spent
in
arms
is
of
more
avail
than
two
months
of
fasting
or
prayer
whosoever
falls
in
battle
his
sins
are
forgiven
at
the
day
of
judgment
his
wounds
shall
be
resplendent
as
vermilion
and
odoriferous
as
musk
and
the
loss
of
limbs
shall
be
supplied
by
the
wings
of
angels
and
cherubim
god
loveth
not
the
transgressors
kill
them
wheresoever
ye
find
them
mohammed
no
less
than
many
other
emperors
and
tsars
appears
to
have
conducted
himself
in
battle
according
to
the
wise
principle
that
a
head
without
a
halo
is
infinitely
more
desirable
than
a
halo
without
a
head
yet
he
was
profoundly
convinced
that
the
ultimate
victory
of
islam
depended
upon
the
sword
the
koran
of
this
period
breathes
defiance
against
the
enemies
of
islam
on
almost
every
page
its
profuse
maledictions
once
confined
to
the
evildoers
of
mecca
now
include
all
unbelievers
everywhere
when
mohammed
once
had
captured
a
fortress
inhabited
by
a
tribe
of
jews
his
judgment
was
the
men
shall
be
put
to
death
the
women
and
children
sold
into
slavery
and
the
spoil
divided
amongst
the
army
then
trenches
were
dug
some
seven
hundred
men
were
marched
out
forced
to
seat
themselves
in
rows
along
the
top
of
the
trenches
beheaded
and
then
tumbled
into
a
long
gaping
grave
meanwhile
the
prophet
looked
on
until
tiring
of
the
monotonous
spectacle
he
departed
to
amuse
himself
with
a
jewess
whose
husband
had
just
perished
he
continued
these
conquests
until
at
his
death
in
he
was
the
master
of
nearly
all
arabia
and
revered
almost
as
a
god
yet
when
omar
his
first
lieutenant
captured
jerusalem
in
he
ensured
the
conquered
jews
and
christians
free
exercise
of
their
religion
and
the
security
of
their
persons
and
their
goods
but
when
the
crusaders
took
jerusalem
in
they
massacred
all
the
mohammedans
and
burnt
the
jews
alive
it
is
estimated
that
persons
were
put
to
death
in
less
than
a
week
to
attest
the
superior
morality
of
the
christian
faith
the
successors
of
mohammed
the
caliphs
in
less
than
a
century
conquered
syria
egypt
babylonia
persia
turkestan
spain
northern
africa
sicily
and
southern
france
today
are
followers
of
mohammed
a
man
who
began
as
a
humble
religious
leader
and
ended
as
an
adroit
politician
and
powerful
general
a
man
who
hid
during
battles
who
often
broke
faith
with
friend
and
foe
alike
a
charlatan
and
demagogue
of
general
intellectual
incompetency
and
a
victim
of
mental
disease
jesus
when
we
come
to
consider
the
life
of
jesus
a
far
different
and
more
intricate
problem
is
met
with
none
but
the
most
illogical
and
purposely
ignorant
of
religious
apologists
will
admit
that
the
life
of
jesus
has
been
misrepresented
by
his
followers
to
suit
their
particular
aims
had
the
followers
of
the
moralist
epictetus
or
the
rabbi
hillel
written
lives
of
these
two
teachers
they
would
be
quite
similar
to
the
reputed
life
of
jesus
the
moral
sentiments
attributed
to
christ
in
the
gospels
were
borrowed
from
the
jewish
rabbis
and
the
numerous
cults
that
flourished
in
that
age
the
birth
death
and
resurrection
of
christ
is
quite
similar
to
the
myths
of
that
time
concerning
the
savior
gods
adonis
isis
osiris
attis
mithra
and
a
multitude
of
others
a
full
exposition
of
the
subject
the
reader
is
referred
to
carpenter
pagan
and
christian
creeds
the
evidence
for
the
point
of
view
that
jesus
was
actually
a
historic
character
is
so
slight
that
such
scholars
as
robertson
smith
professor
drews
couchoud
and
many
others
deny
the
historic
reality
of
christ
on
the
ground
that
the
gospels
are
totally
unreliable
as
history
that
paul
bears
no
witness
to
a
human
jesus
and
that
the
pagan
and
jewish
writers
are
strangely
silent
about
the
messiah
jesus
there
are
in
existence
only
lines
from
jewish
and
pagan
writers
referring
to
jesus
these
include
a
reference
in
annals
and
brief
references
by
suetonius
and
pliny
the
younger
these
three
references
are
considered
spurious
by
many
scholars
and
even
if
they
were
all
to
be
accepted
it
would
mean
that
the
total
pagan
testimony
as
to
the
historicity
of
jesus
is
confined
to
three
very
vague
and
brief
references
written
a
century
after
the
reputed
time
of
jesus
the
longest
reference
to
jesus
is
in
the
writings
of
the
jewish
historian
josephus
the
passage
referring
to
jesus
in
his
jewish
antiquities
has
been
considered
as
spurious
even
by
conservative
scholars
a
group
of
scholars
has
always
deemed
it
very
probable
however
that
this
spurious
reference
may
have
replaced
an
unfavorable
reference
to
jesus
in
the
original
working
on
this
theory
eisler
has
purged
of
interpolations
this
work
by
a
painstaking
and
scholarly
investigation
however
it
must
be
pointed
out
that
with
regard
to
jesus
actual
existence
what
divided
the
christians
and
was
not
the
question
whether
or
not
jesus
existed
but
the
vastly
more
pertinent
and
essentially
different
question
whether
or
not
the
obscure
galilean
carpenter
executed
by
a
roman
governor
as
king
of
the
jews
was
really
a
superhuman
being
who
had
overcome
death
the
of
mankind
foretold
by
the
prophets
the
son
of
god
himself
to
the
jews
jesus
was
indeed
a
heretic
and
an
agitator
of
the
lower
orders
to
the
pagans
he
was
a
magician
who
through
sham
miracles
and
with
subversive
words
had
incited
the
people
to
rebellion
and
as
a
leader
of
a
gang
of
desperate
men
had
attempted
to
seize
the
royal
crown
of
judæa
as
others
had
done
before
and
after
him
the
writers
referred
to
jesus
as
a
wizard
a
demagogue
and
a
rebel
we
are
fortunate
at
this
date
to
have
brought
to
our
attention
a
masterful
work
by
robert
eisler
a
work
which
will
be
as
revolutionary
to
the
study
of
christianity
as
was
darwin
origin
of
the
species
in
the
realms
of
science
and
similarly
the
former
work
will
be
the
basis
upon
which
much
progress
will
be
made
in
a
great
field
eisler
unfolds
a
great
mass
of
hitherto
unknown
information
concerning
the
life
the
actual
appearance
and
the
doings
of
jesus
he
definitely
establishes
the
proof
of
jesus
actual
existence
and
makes
clear
many
hitherto
obscure
utterances
and
deeds
of
this
prophet
the
descriptions
which
follow
are
based
on
the
material
in
this
work
of
eisler
the
messiah
jesus
in
the
complete
statement
of
josephus
on
pilate
governorship
we
find
at
that
time
there
appeared
a
certain
man
of
magical
power
if
it
is
permissible
to
call
him
a
man
whom
certain
greeks
call
a
son
of
god
but
his
disciples
the
true
prophet
said
to
raise
the
dead
and
heal
all
diseases
his
nature
and
his
form
were
human
a
man
of
simple
appearance
mature
age
small
in
stature
three
cubits
high
with
a
long
face
long
nose
and
meeting
eyebrows
so
that
they
who
see
him
might
be
affrighted
with
scanty
hair
but
with
a
parting
in
the
middle
of
his
head
after
the
manner
of
the
nazarites
and
with
an
undeveloped
beard
only
in
semblance
was
he
superhuman
for
he
gave
some
astonishing
and
spectacular
exhibitions
but
again
if
i
look
at
his
commonplace
physique
i
for
one
can
not
call
him
an
angel
and
everything
whatsoever
he
wrought
through
some
invisible
power
he
wrought
through
some
word
and
a
command
some
said
of
him
first
law
giver
is
risen
again
and
displays
many
healings
and
magic
arts
others
said
is
sent
from
god
howbeit
in
many
things
he
disobeyed
the
law
and
kept
not
the
sabbath
according
to
our
fathers
custom
and
many
of
the
multitude
followed
after
him
and
accepted
his
teachings
and
many
souls
were
excited
thinking
that
thereby
the
jewish
tribes
might
be
freed
from
roman
hands
but
it
was
his
custom
most
of
the
time
to
abide
over
against
the
city
on
the
mount
of
olives
and
there
too
he
bestowed
his
healings
upon
the
people
and
there
assembled
unto
him
of
helpers
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
a
multitude
of
the
mob
now
when
they
saw
his
power
how
he
accomplished
whatsoever
he
would
by
a
magic
word
and
when
they
had
made
known
to
him
their
will
that
he
should
enter
into
the
city
cut
down
the
roman
troops
and
pilate
and
rule
over
us
he
disdained
us
not
and
having
all
flocked
into
jerusalem
they
raised
an
uproar
against
pilate
uttering
blasphemies
alike
against
god
and
against
cæsar
and
when
knowledge
of
it
came
to
the
jewish
leaders
they
assembled
together
with
the
high
priests
and
spake
are
powerless
and
too
weak
to
withstand
the
romans
but
seeing
that
the
is
bent
we
will
go
and
impart
to
pilate
what
we
have
heard
and
we
shall
be
safe
lest
he
hear
of
it
from
others
and
we
be
robbed
of
our
substance
and
ourselves
slaughtered
and
the
children
of
israel
dispersed
and
they
went
and
imparted
the
matter
to
pilate
and
he
sent
and
had
many
of
the
multitude
slain
and
he
had
that
brought
up
and
after
instituting
an
inquiry
concerning
him
he
passed
this
sentence
upon
him
is
a
malefactor
a
rebel
a
robber
thirsting
for
the
crown
and
they
took
him
and
crucified
him
according
to
the
custom
of
their
fathers
such
is
the
history
of
jesus
as
contrasted
with
the
myth
of
jesus
in
the
new
testament
this
description
of
the
actual
appearance
of
jesus
for
the
first
time
gives
us
a
clue
to
the
mental
and
physical
characteristics
of
this
prophet
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
at
the
time
that
jesus
achieved
manhood
his
people
and
his
nation
were
under
the
complete
domination
of
rome
and
oppressed
by
a
race
whom
the
jews
looked
upon
as
cursed
barbarians
and
idolaters
the
country
was
overrun
with
religious
zealots
who
stormed
over
the
cities
and
villages
preaching
the
immediate
destruction
of
the
world
and
the
proximity
of
the
coming
of
the
messiah
the
fact
that
jesus
had
to
bear
the
hard
fate
of
a
deformed
body
may
go
far
in
helping
to
explain
this
remarkable
character
it
is
common
knowledge
how
frequently
weak
and
deformed
children
have
to
suffer
from
the
cruelty
and
neglect
of
environment
a
factor
which
can
not
but
produce
a
peculiar
reaction
on
the
childish
mind
which
has
a
effect
in
later
life
this
accounts
for
jesus
indifference
towards
his
mother
and
brothers
of
a
delicate
constitution
he
must
have
suffered
from
insults
a
great
deal
more
than
the
others
which
throws
some
light
on
the
severe
punishment
demanded
by
jesus
for
comparatively
harmless
insults
under
such
circumstances
it
is
easy
to
explain
how
every
neighbor
and
although
to
the
weak
naturally
an
enemy
came
to
be
included
in
the
sphere
of
that
love
which
is
the
nucleus
of
jesus
teaching
for
the
cripple
has
to
face
the
dilemma
either
of
warping
everything
into
a
powerful
misanthropic
hatred
or
else
to
overcome
this
feeling
of
revenge
for
the
high
moral
superiority
of
a
plato
mendelssohn
or
a
kant
jesus
chose
the
latter
of
the
two
courses
and
we
may
well
imagine
that
it
was
not
at
golgotha
that
he
had
the
first
occasion
to
cry
out
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
in
the
case
of
jesus
the
whole
paradoxical
thought
of
his
being
the
vicarious
and
world
redeemer
can
best
be
understood
as
the
solution
proposed
in
the
of
the
question
which
had
occupied
job
to
wit
why
must
the
innocent
suffer
if
the
maimed
in
body
refuse
to
consider
himself
as
forsaken
by
his
god
as
a
sinner
punished
for
some
guilt
of
which
he
is
unconscious
he
can
not
but
assume
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
vocation
to
suffering
and
believe
in
the
inscrutable
plan
of
salvation
in
which
his
own
life
and
sufferings
are
called
upon
to
play
some
part
nothing
but
this
conviction
of
being
thus
elected
can
afford
him
the
desired
compensation
for
his
depressed
and
hampered
ego
a
repressed
nature
of
this
type
will
in
seeking
such
a
compensation
escape
from
the
harsh
reality
into
the
realm
of
dreams
this
is
the
basis
of
what
the
physician
recognizes
in
hysteria
and
in
the
mental
disease
termed
dementia
præcox
the
glorious
daydreams
of
the
millennium
the
time
of
bliss
when
all
strife
and
all
hate
will
disappear
from
the
earth
when
all
the
crooked
will
be
made
straight
find
their
best
explanation
in
this
peculiarity
they
console
the
suffering
and
for
the
bitter
reality
which
in
the
light
of
the
old
messianic
prophecies
appears
only
as
a
nightmare
promptly
to
be
chased
away
by
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
a
new
a
perfect
era
the
davidic
jesus
in
spite
or
rather
because
of
his
servile
form
feels
that
he
is
himself
the
secret
incognito
king
of
that
wonderful
realm
the
monarch
whom
god
some
time
in
the
future
nay
right
here
and
before
the
passing
of
the
present
generation
will
transform
while
at
the
same
time
revealing
his
kingdom
it
is
but
natural
that
in
the
mental
development
of
such
individuals
they
should
seek
to
be
great
glorious
and
to
achieve
the
supernatural
since
they
themselves
are
denied
the
ordinary
satisfactions
if
in
addition
such
individuals
believe
that
they
have
had
a
divine
call
if
the
disability
of
the
body
so
preys
on
the
mind
that
the
sensitive
structure
gives
way
to
delusions
then
there
results
an
aberration
from
the
normal
and
usual
processes
of
thought
to
be
sure
not
the
rabid
violent
form
of
mental
disease
but
yet
a
deviation
from
the
normal
manner
of
thinking
such
was
the
case
with
the
prophet
jesus
afflicted
in
body
but
endowed
with
a
sensitive
mind
exposed
to
an
unusual
environment
of
seething
unrest
and
political
ferment
and
firmly
convinced
in
the
current
fancies
regarding
the
approaching
destruction
of
the
world
the
conquest
of
the
evil
power
and
the
reign
of
god
jesus
became
the
subject
of
a
delusion
that
he
was
the
only
true
messiah
who
had
been
presaged
by
the
prophets
of
old
the
greatest
difficulty
encountered
in
every
attempt
to
present
the
life
and
work
of
jesus
according
to
the
evidence
of
his
own
words
preserved
in
the
sources
is
the
sharp
irreconcilable
contradiction
between
the
fire
and
sword
sayings
on
the
one
side
and
the
beatitudes
on
the
peacemakers
and
the
meek
the
prohibition
to
kill
to
be
angry
to
resist
wrong
and
the
command
to
love
one
enemy
contained
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
on
the
other
in
the
early
period
of
his
messianic
career
the
period
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
jesus
was
a
thorough
quietist
but
if
we
realize
that
the
delusion
that
he
was
the
messiah
had
entered
his
mind
so
vehemently
that
he
firmly
believed
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
imminent
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
save
as
many
as
possible
we
can
understand
his
acquiescence
to
the
violence
which
followed
moreover
he
was
clearly
forced
to
the
fatal
road
by
the
idea
that
he
must
set
on
foot
a
movement
of
hundreds
of
thousands
the
picture
of
the
exodus
from
egypt
with
the
fantastic
figures
given
in
the
old
testament
the
messianic
rising
he
was
to
initiate
could
not
be
regarded
as
realized
if
he
left
the
country
with
a
band
of
some
hundred
elect
if
he
wished
however
to
put
at
least
of
the
population
in
motion
the
method
of
sending
out
messengers
had
proved
altogether
unsatisfactory
he
must
try
the
effect
of
his
own
words
in
a
place
where
and
at
a
time
when
he
was
sure
to
reach
the
greatest
multitude
of
his
people
that
could
only
be
in
jerusalem
at
the
time
of
the
great
pilgrimage
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
moreover
the
desired
result
could
only
be
obtained
of
course
if
he
openly
proclaimed
himself
to
be
the
messiah
then
it
was
that
the
prophet
of
quiet
reversed
his
words
and
armed
his
disciples
jesus
was
fully
aware
of
the
illegality
of
this
arming
of
his
disciples
and
of
his
own
direction
to
purchase
a
weapon
none
the
less
he
saw
no
escape
from
this
bitter
necessity
the
prediction
of
the
prophet
must
be
fulfilled
according
to
which
the
righteous
servant
of
the
lord
must
be
numbered
among
the
lawless
transgressors
true
it
is
that
he
did
not
lead
the
revolt
himself
but
tarried
with
his
disciples
at
the
last
supper
at
a
house
near
by
the
fighting
when
he
becomes
aware
that
his
secret
hiding
place
on
the
mount
of
olives
has
been
betrayed
jesus
hopes
for
a
miracle
from
god
up
to
the
last
captured
he
is
led
away
to
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
family
on
the
mount
of
olives
where
while
jesus
is
questioned
by
the
high
priest
peter
unrecognized
warms
himself
at
the
fire
in
the
courtyard
and
thrice
denies
his
master
he
was
then
taken
to
the
roman
where
sentence
was
passed
and
he
was
led
off
to
the
place
of
execution
and
there
deserted
by
all
his
followers
except
a
few
galilean
women
then
was
heard
the
last
despairing
cry
of
the
desolate
dying
martyr
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
thus
ended
the
career
of
this
deformed
prophet
with
the
sensitive
deluded
mind
a
martyr
who
attempted
only
to
effect
reforms
amongst
his
own
people
in
his
own
small
locality
moses
with
regard
to
the
life
the
deeds
and
the
words
of
the
prophet
moses
we
have
no
history
only
myth
and
legend
the
existence
of
moses
is
not
demonstrated
by
the
biblical
books
which
are
falsely
ascribed
to
him
yet
we
can
not
be
certain
that
such
a
character
did
not
exist
in
any
event
we
must
judge
his
character
from
the
writings
ascribed
to
him
the
legend
of
the
child
cast
upon
the
waters
is
to
be
found
in
the
folklore
of
all
nations
this
legend
concerning
moses
relates
that
one
day
pharaoh
daughter
while
bathing
with
her
maids
in
the
nile
found
a
hebrew
child
exposed
on
the
waters
in
obedience
to
a
new
decree
she
adopted
the
boy
gave
him
an
egyptian
name
and
brought
him
up
in
her
palace
as
a
prince
she
had
him
educated
and
the
fair
inference
is
that
he
was
schooled
in
the
culture
of
the
egyptians
the
royal
lady
made
of
the
hebrew
an
egyptian
gentleman
yet
although
his
face
was
shaved
and
outwardly
he
appeared
to
be
an
egyptian
at
heart
he
remained
a
hebrew
one
day
when
he
was
grown
moses
went
slumming
among
his
own
people
to
look
at
their
burdens
and
he
spied
an
egyptian
smiting
a
hebrew
he
was
so
overcome
by
passion
at
this
scene
that
he
killed
the
man
on
the
spot
the
crime
became
known
there
was
a
hue
and
cry
raised
and
the
king
had
a
search
made
for
moses
with
the
intention
of
slaying
him
with
all
hope
of
a
career
in
egypt
ended
moses
escaped
to
the
peninsula
of
sinai
and
entered
the
family
of
an
arab
sheik
the
peninsula
of
sinai
lies
clasped
between
two
arms
of
the
red
sea
it
is
a
wilderness
of
mountains
covered
with
a
thin
almost
transparent
coating
of
vegetation
which
serves
as
pasture
to
the
bedouin
flocks
among
the
hills
that
crown
the
high
plateau
there
is
one
which
at
the
time
of
moses
was
called
the
mount
of
god
it
was
holy
ground
to
the
egyptians
and
also
to
the
arabs
who
ascended
as
pilgrims
and
drew
off
their
sandals
when
they
reached
the
top
now
is
it
strange
that
sinai
should
have
excited
reverence
and
dread
it
is
indeed
a
weird
land
vast
and
stern
stand
the
mountains
with
their
five
granite
peaks
pointing
to
the
sky
avalanches
like
those
of
the
alps
but
of
sand
not
of
snow
rush
down
their
naked
sides
with
a
clear
tinkling
sound
a
peculiar
property
resides
in
the
air
the
human
voice
can
be
heard
at
a
surprising
distance
and
swells
out
into
a
reverberating
roar
and
sometimes
there
rises
from
among
the
hills
a
dull
booming
sound
like
the
distant
firing
of
heavy
guns
let
us
attempt
to
realize
what
moses
must
have
felt
when
he
was
driven
out
of
egypt
into
such
a
harsh
and
rugged
land
imagine
this
man
the
adopted
son
of
a
royal
personage
who
was
accustomed
to
all
the
splendor
of
the
egyptian
court
to
the
busy
turmoil
of
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
to
reclining
in
a
carpeted
gondola
or
staying
with
a
noble
at
his
country
house
in
a
moment
all
is
changed
he
dwells
in
a
tent
alone
on
the
mountain
side
a
shepherd
with
a
crook
in
his
hand
he
is
married
to
the
daughter
of
a
barbarian
his
career
is
at
an
end
he
realizes
that
never
again
will
he
enter
that
palace
where
once
he
was
received
with
honor
where
now
his
name
is
uttered
only
with
contempt
never
again
will
he
discourse
with
grave
and
learned
men
in
his
favorite
haunts
and
never
again
will
he
see
the
people
of
his
tribe
whom
he
loves
and
for
whom
he
endures
this
miserable
fate
they
will
suffer
but
he
will
not
help
them
they
will
mourn
but
he
will
not
hear
them
in
his
dreams
he
hears
and
sees
them
he
hears
the
whistling
of
the
lash
and
the
convulsive
sobs
and
groans
he
sees
the
poor
slaves
toiling
in
the
fields
and
sees
the
daughters
of
israel
carried
off
to
the
harem
with
struggling
arms
and
streaming
hair
he
sees
the
chamber
of
the
woman
in
labor
the
seated
shuddering
writhing
form
the
mother
struggling
against
maternity
dreading
her
release
for
the
officer
is
standing
by
the
door
ready
as
soon
as
a
male
child
is
born
to
put
it
to
death
the
arabs
who
gave
him
shelter
were
also
children
of
abraham
and
they
related
to
him
legends
of
the
ancient
days
they
told
him
of
the
patriarchs
who
lay
buried
in
canaan
with
their
wives
they
spoke
of
the
god
whom
his
fathers
had
worshiped
then
as
one
who
returns
to
a
long
lost
home
the
egyptian
returned
to
the
faith
of
the
desert
to
the
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
as
he
wandered
on
the
mountain
heights
he
looked
to
the
west
and
saw
a
desert
beyond
it
lay
canaan
the
home
of
his
ancestors
a
land
of
peace
and
soon
to
be
a
land
of
hope
for
now
new
ideas
rose
tumultuously
within
him
began
to
see
visions
and
to
dream
he
heard
voices
and
beheld
no
form
he
saw
trees
which
blazed
with
fire
and
yet
were
not
consumed
he
became
a
prophet
and
entered
into
the
ecstatic
stage
is
he
began
to
have
illusions
and
dwelling
on
the
misery
and
suffering
of
his
people
his
mind
becomes
deluded
with
the
idea
that
he
has
been
chosen
by
his
god
to
liberate
his
people
from
the
tyranny
of
their
oppressors
meanwhile
the
king
had
died
and
a
new
pharaoh
had
ascended
the
throne
moses
returns
to
egypt
to
carry
out
the
great
designs
which
he
had
formed
he
announces
to
the
elders
of
his
people
to
the
heads
of
the
houses
and
the
sheiks
of
the
tribes
that
the
god
of
abraham
had
appeared
to
him
in
sinai
and
had
revealed
his
true
name
it
was
jehovah
he
had
been
sent
by
jehovah
to
egypt
to
bring
away
his
people
to
lead
them
to
canaan
in
company
with
his
brother
aaron
moses
asked
pharaoh
to
liberate
the
children
of
israel
but
after
several
vain
attempts
to
dazzle
pharaoh
with
his
skill
as
a
magician
he
was
met
with
an
obstinate
refusal
moses
before
pharaoh
descends
to
the
level
of
a
vulgar
sorcerer
armed
with
a
magic
wand
whose
performances
only
draw
our
smiles
this
charlatanry
having
been
unsuccessful
the
wizard
connives
with
his
accomplice
jehovah
to
have
inflicted
upon
the
egyptians
the
ten
plagues
then
the
loving
and
kind
father
having
killed
innumerable
egyptians
as
the
story
relates
so
terrorizes
the
minds
of
his
other
children
in
egypt
that
pharaoh
is
finally
convinced
that
he
must
allow
the
chosen
people
to
leave
his
domain
the
israelites
quitted
egypt
carrying
away
with
them
the
gold
and
silver
of
their
oppressors
they
then
entered
the
desert
the
magic
art
of
moses
enabled
them
to
pass
through
the
red
sea
whereas
the
pharaoh
who
was
pursuing
them
was
engulfed
with
his
whole
army
again
the
chosen
people
are
liberated
by
means
of
the
death
of
multitudes
of
egyptians
truly
jehovah
at
that
time
must
have
loved
them
well
or
did
some
other
deity
form
the
egyptians
it
matters
not
that
the
crossing
of
the
red
sea
and
the
drowning
of
pharaoh
are
romantic
incidents
not
only
unknown
to
the
egyptian
texts
but
even
to
the
earliest
of
hebrew
prophets
it
matters
not
for
the
story
is
the
important
thing
even
though
it
is
an
inspired
story
inspired
by
the
jehovah
who
tortured
and
killed
the
egyptians
to
show
how
well
he
loved
people
this
wild
west
story
with
its
multitudes
of
slaughters
proceeds
to
the
wilderness
of
sinai
and
there
again
the
prophet
moses
goes
into
a
secret
seance
and
finally
announces
that
god
had
delivered
laws
to
him
which
had
been
issued
from
the
clouds
what
a
great
showman
was
this
prophet
barnum
must
have
been
a
devoted
admirer
of
moses
for
moses
was
the
first
to
create
the
circus
for
these
laws
given
by
jehovah
are
described
in
two
places
and
the
circus
varies
in
both
places
exodus
xx
and
exodus
xxxiv
are
the
two
texts
which
differ
considerably
to
further
convince
the
children
of
israel
moses
tells
them
the
story
of
how
he
had
cajoled
jehovah
into
allowing
him
to
see
what
no
man
had
hitherto
seen
the
form
of
jehovah
for
it
appears
that
jehovah
was
so
pleased
with
this
murderer
charlatan
and
wizard
that
he
allowed
him
to
glimpse
his
hind
quarters
at
least
jehovah
had
a
sense
of
humor
what
a
bag
of
tricks
this
prophet
had
at
his
command
the
prophet
waves
his
arms
and
tugs
at
his
gown
and
lo
and
behold
the
lord
has
spoken
the
following
is
a
specimen
of
the
revelations
which
the
lord
is
supposed
to
have
dictated
to
moses
leviticus
xiv
the
priest
shall
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
trespass
offering
and
put
it
upon
the
tip
of
the
ear
of
him
who
is
to
be
cleansed
and
upon
the
thumb
of
his
hand
and
upon
the
great
toe
of
his
foot
and
the
priest
shall
pour
of
the
oil
into
the
palm
of
his
own
hand
and
shall
sprinkle
with
his
finger
some
of
the
oil
that
is
in
his
hand
seven
times
before
the
lord
surely
it
must
have
been
a
god
with
a
superior
mentality
who
dictated
this
for
it
surpasses
our
feeble
comprehension
and
we
can
well
imagine
jehovah
wrath
when
the
priest
confuses
his
and
twirling
his
arms
again
moses
gives
forth
this
oracle
numbers
xv
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
bid
them
that
they
make
them
a
fringe
upon
the
corner
of
their
garments
throughout
their
generations
and
that
they
put
upon
the
fringe
of
each
corner
a
cord
of
blue
etc
jehovah
chooses
blue
as
the
divine
color
royal
purple
divine
blue
then
there
is
the
familiar
myth
of
the
prophet
tapping
of
the
rock
to
bring
forth
water
in
the
desert
the
story
of
the
manna
the
tale
of
the
doves
thus
can
the
fabled
life
of
moses
be
divided
into
two
stages
the
early
period
of
illusions
hallucinations
and
delusions
and
the

charlatanry

demagoguery
neither
must

think
that
we
moderns
are
the
first
to
peer
through
this
sham
for
what
the
israelites
thought
of
these
laws
appears
from
the
bitter
criticism
of
moses
and
aaron
which
the
haggadah
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
rebel
korah
when
we
were
given
the
ten
commandments
each
of
us
learnt
them
directly
from
mount
sinai
there
were
only
the
ten
commandments
and
we
heard
no
orders
about
cake
or
to

or
it
was
only
in

to
usurp
the
dominion
for
himself
and
to
impart
honor

on

of

how

soundness
of

for
a
belief
in

is
better
to

to
insult
its
memory
by
retaining

when
the

thousand

in

our
interplanetary
visitor
is
firmly
convinced
that
all
religion
no
matter
what
its
antiquity
or
its
modernity
may
be
is
an
invention
of
our
groping
earthly
minds
it
occurs
to
him
that
it
would
be
interesting
and
proper
to
lay
aside
all
theology
all
creed
all
the
superficial
trappings
placed
by
man
about
his
conceptions
of
a
deity
and
consider
only
the
basic
the
literature
on
the
subject
revealed
to
him
that
even
on
this
broad
and
basic
principle
not
all
religionists
were
agreed
he
found
a
threefold
classification
those
who
held
to
the
belief
in
an
anthropomorphic
personal
god
who
was
benevolent
omniscient
and
omnipotent
those
who
saw
in
the
constitution
of
our
universe
an
impersonal
supreme
power
who
had
created
the
universe
but
who
had
not
given
us
any
revelation
and
thus
has
no
need
for
worship
by
prayer
and
sacrifice
those
who
very
recently
conceived
of
the
deity
as
a
cosmic
force
an
ultimate
or
as
a
mathematical
or
physical
law
such
are
the
hypotheses
of
jeans
and
eddington
the
martian
set
about
therefore
with
the
principle
that
god
is
a
hypothesis
and
as
such
stands
in
need
of
proof
the
belief
in
a
personal
god
the
martian
as
our
guest
had
by
this
time
had
ample
opportunity
to
survey
our
civilization
and
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
things
with
which
god
in
his
goodness
had
endowed
his
earthly
children
a
proponent
of
a
personal
god
informs
him
that
his
deity
is
an
infinite
personal
being
of
consciousness
intelligence
will
good
unity
and
beauty
the
supreme
the
infinite
personality
who
was
loving
benevolent
omnipotent
and
omniscient
like
the
american
from
missouri
the
visitor
hastened
to
see
for
himself
the
marvelous
workings
of
such
an
exalted
being
for
surely
such
a
being
with
such
attributes
as
he
was
credited
with
would
certainly
be
in
an
excellent
position
to
bestow
great
gifts
upon
his
earthly
children
the
martian
is
informed
that
the
vast
majority
of
our
inhabitants
no
matter
what
their
geographical
distribution
may
be
are
suffering
from
a
financial
depression
brought
on
by
the
last
world
war
war
and
cruelty
are
synonymous
in
the
mind
of
our
seeker
for
god
and
immediately
there
arises
a
conflict
between
the
conception
of
an
omnipotent
and
loving
god
and
one
who
would
permit
war
and
cruelty
fearing
that
he
has
not
comprehended
the
meaning
of
an
omnipotent
being
he
turns
to
the
lexicon
for
verification
only
to
learn
that
it
means
an
being
how
then
could
an
omnipotent
being
permit
wholesale
and
private
murder
is
he
not
rather
a
demon
than
a
god
on
the
other
hand
if
this
being
is
not
omnipotent
then
he
is
a
useless
god
and
there
is
no
need
for
all
the
fears
which
religion
breeds
no
need
for
creed
and
worship
every
war
particularly
this
last
one
is
an
indictment
of
god
god
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
world
is
seemly
only
to
minds
drugged
with
an
irrational
creed
if
there
is
a
god
he
is
quite
careless
of
human
or
human
suffering
the
deaths
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
mean
no
more
to
him
than
the
deaths
of
a
hundred
thousand
ants
a
couple
of
million
men
locked
in
a
death
struggle
on
the
battlefield
is
only
a
replica
of
the
struggle
that
has
been
going
on
in
the
animal
world
throughout
time
if
there
be
a
god
he
made
he
designed
all
this
he
fashioned
the
hooks
for
the
slaughter
the
teeth
for
the
tearing
the
talons
for
destruction
and
man
with
his
multiplied
weapons
of
destruction
has
but
imitated
his
example
a
world
without
god
and
in
which
humanity
is
gradually
learning
the
way
to
better
things
is
an
inspiration
to
renewed
effort
after
the
right
a
world
such
as
this
with
god
is
enough
to
drive
insane
all
with
intelligence
enough
to
appreciate
the
situation
cohen
war
civilization
and
the
churches
when
the
martian
investigated
the
annals
of
the
world
war
he
found
despite
the
opportunities
providence
had
had
of
showing
its
benevolence
the
affair
of
the
sinking
of
the
the
torpedoing
of
hospital
ships
vessels
that
were
not
engaged
in
fighting
but
in
bringing
home
wounded
men
who
had
fought
in
god
cause
he
found
descriptions
of
the
slaughter
of
men
and
women
and
children
in
air
raids
and
he
naturally
concludes
that
the
providence
of
god
is
an
insult
to
the
earthly
intelligence
greatly
disturbed
he
picks
up
one
of
our
newspapers
and
the
stories
of
hate
and
racial
antagonism
rear
their
ugly
heads
these
together
with
jealousy
and
fear
seem
to
him
to
be
the
outstanding
features
of
our
attitudes
a
benevolent
loving
omnipotent
father
guiding
our
destinies
yet
allowing
such
monstrosities
to
exist
the
conundrum
grows
deeper
as
he
proceeds
it
is
a
bright
day
and
the
martian
is
aware
of
a
brought
on
by
the
effort
to
understand
the
ways
of
earthlings
and
therefore
decides
to
drive
through
the
city
streets
yet
this
drive
affords
him
no
relaxation
for
on
every
side
two
diametrically
opposed
sights
meet
his
keen
eyes
luxury
and
poverty
poverty
and
starvation
yet
the
prayer
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
no
martian
father
would
allow
his
children
to
starve
if
he
did
the
law
would
fine
him
and
imprison
him
since
these
earthlings
are
neglected
by
their
heavenly
father
and
are
powerless
to
indict
him
the
least
they
could
do
would
be
to
stop
paying
tribute
to
him
if
the
god
of
these
earthlings
bothers
not
about
them
why
should
they
trouble
about
god
the
son
of
god
who
could
once
create
a
miraculous
batch
of
fish
to
satisfy
a
few
fishermen
can
do
nothing
to
help
these
starving
millions
aloud
he
muses
is
there
no
place
on
earth
which
is
free
from
this
contradiction
his
automobile
happens
to
stop
in
front
of
an
immense
edifice
marked
hospital
and
his
curiosity
is
sufficiently
aroused
to
cause
him
to
alight
and
enter
the
physician
in
charge
courteously
asks
his
distinguished
visitor
to
inspect
this
refuge
for
those
suffering
with
pain
he
remembers
that
a
religionist
had
told
him
that
disease
is
a
visitation
of
the
lord
for
our
sins
in
the
same
breath
with
which
he
had
added
that
the
lord
was
loving
and
compassionate
if
that
were
so
then
this
was
the
ideal
place
to
witness
the
infinite
goodness
and
compassion
of
the
creator
of
all
earthlings
but
the
first
scene
to
meet
his
gaze
was
that
of
a
woman
in
childbirth
the
torture
the
excruciating
pain
and
the
mental
anguish
of
the
human
female
before
his
eyes
defied
his
martian
power
of
expression
this
process
of
birth
it
was
explained
to
him
was
not
a
pathological
one
nor
a
disease
but
a
physiological
function
to
this
the
martian
could
not
refrain
from
replying
from
your
own
words
doctor
it
is
readily
understood
that
your
women
experience
a
torture
more
acute
more
and
of
longer
duration
than
your
jesus
experienced
during
his
crucifixion
and
your
world
commiserates
and
sheds
oceans
of
tears
when
they
contemplate
the
anguish
of
jesus
on
the
cross
but
no
mention
is
made
of
the
agony
which
is
the
fate
of
every
woman
who
brings
another
human
being
into
this
of
worlds
but
my
dear
martian
exclaims
the
physician
the
heavenly
father
has
ordained
that
in
anguish
shall
woman
bring
forth
her
young
the
other
deliberated
on
the
compassion
of
the
benevolent
father
in
silence
and
continued
on
his
rounds
through
the
hospital
nearby
was
the
crib
containing
a
baby
of
a
few
days
suffering
with
a
congenital
heart
disease
the
infant
lips
were
blue
so
was
the
body
blue
and
the
gasping
for
breath
and
heaving
of
the
small
chest
were
pitiful
to
behold
this
infant
nonchalantly
remarked
the
physician
was
born
with
a
greatly
defective
heart
it
will
live
for
a
few
days
it
will
thirst
for
air
it
will
have
intense
the
lungs
will
fill
with
fluid
and
then
it
will
drown
in
its
own
secretions
the
martian
recalled
the
time
he
had
plunged
under
the
water
and
remained
there
too
long
vividly
he
remembered
the
thirst
for
air
the
seeming
bursting
of
the
lungs
the
compression
and
grip
of
the
muscles
of
the
throat
and
chest
and
he
could
not
help
exclaiming
benevolent
compassionate
being
the
physician
continued
this
child
pointing
to
a
beautiful
robust
boy
of
ten
years
was
in
perfect
health
until
he
fell
in
the
street
and
received
a
minor
cut
which
the
parents
treated
with
home
remedies
but
which
in
a
few
days
was
diagnosed
as
tetanus
and
the
doctor
went
on
to
explain
that
the
compassion
of
the
lord
is
great
when
this
occurs
for
the
child
gets
convulsions
the
jaws
become
locked
and
beads
of
cold
sweat
stand
out
on
the
child
forehead
in
his
anguish
the
convulsions
increase
in
severity
and
in
duration
so
that
finally
they
are
continuous
and
the
child
lies
with
the
heels
and
back
of
the
head
only
touching
the
bed
the
rest
of
the
body
is
arched
the
convulsions
then
become
so
severe
that
the
body
is
so
bent
backwards
at
times
that
the
head
and
trunk
touch
the
heels
the
misery
of
such
a
child
is
sufficient
to
cause
a
physician
to
lose
his
reason
again
the
martian
murmurs
verily
the
compassion
of
the
lord
is
beyond
understanding
the
child
in
the
next
bed
had
just
become
paralyzed
by
an
attack
of
poliomyelitis
infantile
paralysis
the
martian
observes
how
the
lord
in
his
compassion
saved
a
certain
number
of
these
children
upon
whom
he
vents
his
anger
for
their
sins
by
inflicting
upon
them
this
hideous
disease
he
saves
their
lives
but
to
serve
as
an
everlasting
reminder
as
a
covenant
between
them
and
their
lord
he
paralyzes
their
limbs
the
spectacle
of
these
children
attempting
to
move
making
intense
effort
to
move
paralyzed
limbs
was
the
most
revolting
and
sight
that
he
had
ever
witnessed
this
time
too
the
martian
remarked
verily
the
lord
in
his
infinite
wisdom
and
goodness
strange
tasks
does
perform
the
physician
then
informed
him
of
the
many
men
and
women
who
have
died
of
cancer
a
large
number
of
these
individuals
had
reached
a
period
in
life
where
they
could
just
afford
to
relax
from
their
struggles
for
mere
sustenance
men
and
women
who
had
reached
a
calm
lake
after
journeying
through
troubled
and
tortuous
waters
who
had
fought
the
good
fight
and
had
won
the
just
reward
of
resting
after
their
labors
but
no
the
lord
must
trouble
them
for
their
sins
a
group
of
these
sufferers
is
shown
to
the
martian
and
the
normal
course
of
this
disease
is
explained
this
time
all
he
can
do
is
to
protest
that
he
firmly
asserts
that
not
one
of
our
savage
chiefs
even
were
he
of
the
most
primitive
tribe
of
the
cruelest
imagination
of
the
most
base
and
insane
nature
would
nor
could
conceive
of
such
torture
as
the
loving
father
conceived
when
he
decided
upon
cancer
as
a
visitation
for
our
sins
the
roasting
of
a
witch
alive
is
but
a
mere
trifle
compared
to
the
agony
the
slow
wasting
the
anguish
of
a
cancer
patient
watching
himself
sink
to
death
and
when
death
mercifully
releases
this
sufferer
from
his
hellish
torture
the
preacher
murmurs
lord
thy
will
be
done
the
martian
talks
for
a
few
moments
with
a
sufferer
from
this
disease
and
ascertains
that
the
latter
is
a
devout
and
true
religionist
that
he
has
been
a
good
moral
and
has
lived
strictly
according
to
the
tenets
of
his
creed
that
he
firmly
and
passionately
believes
that
he
has
lived
so
that
he
will
merit
the
reward
of
heaven
an
everlasting
sojourn
in
a
land
where
there
is
no
pain
and
suffering
and
yet
this
devout
religionist
when
he
was
informed
that
he
had
an
incurable
cancer
traveled
the
length
and
breadth
of
his
land
from
one
surgeon
to
another
allowing
himself
to
be
cut
to
pieces
in
order
that
he
might
remain
on
this
earth
but
a
moment
longer
to
stay
and
suffer
the
tortures
of
the
damned
when
he
might
go
to
heaven
and
get
his
reward
in
the
land
where
there
is
no
pain
i
wonder
mused
the
martian
did
the
grim
spectre
of
death
finally
instill
a
grain
of
scepticism
into
his
mind
later
in
the
quiet
of
his
chambers
he
reviews
the
impressions
cruelty
hate
fear
jealousy
racial
antagonism
poverty
luxury
disease
pain
superstition
church
religion
and
intolerance
if
we
suppose
that
the
universe
is
the
creation
of
an
omnipotent
and
benevolent
god
it
becomes
necessary
to
ask
how
pain
and
evil
arise
pain
and
evil
are
either
real
or
unreal
if
they
are
real
then
god
who
being
omnipotent
was
bound
by
no
limitations
and
constrained
by
no
necessities
willfully
created
them
but
the
being
who
willfully
creates
pain
and
evil
can
not
be
benevolent
if
they
are
unreal
then
the
error
which
we
make
when
we
think
them
real
is
a
real
error
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
believe
we
suffer
if
the
belief
is
erroneous
then
it
follows
that
god
willfully
called
falsehood
into
existence
and
deliberately
involved
us
in
unnecessary
error
it
follows
once
again
that
god
can
not
be
benevolent
if
we
regard
pain
and
evil
as
due
to
the
wickedness
of
man
and
not
as
the
creation
of
god
we
are
constrained
to
remember
that
man
himself
is
one
of
god
creations
god
being
conceived
as
all
creative
and
received
his
wickedness
or
his
capacity
for
it
from
whom
if
we
say
that
man
had
no
wickedness
to
begin
with
but
willfully
generated
wickedness
for
himself
we
have
to
face
the
double
difficulty
of
accounting
for
a
how
man
who
is
an
emanation
from
god
can
will
with
a
will
of
his
own
which
is
not
also
a
piece
of
god
will
and
b
how
a
benevolent
god
could
assuming
pain
and
evil
to
be
a
purely
human
creation
deliberately
allow
them
to
be
introduced
into
a
world
that
knew
them
not
when
it
was
open
to
him
to
prevent
such
introductions
joad
mind
and
matter
he
had
seen
that
crime
and
immorality
exist
now
just
as
they
had
existed
before
the
belief
in
one
personal
god
and
just
as
they
promise
to
exist
beyond
our
time
he
had
scrutinized
evidence
revealing
the
incontestable
fact
that
most
criminals
were
religious
and
absolutely
and
proportionately
a
smaller
number
of
criminals
were
in
a
personal
deity
judging
by
these
alone
a
belief
in
a
benevolent
loving
omniscient
omnipotent
and
compassionate
being
could
not
be
sustained
furthermore
if
such
a
god
ever
existed
he
certainly
would
have
revealed
his
true
religion
to
the
first
man
adam
if
he
required
prayer
to
satisfy
his
vanity
he
surely
would
have
told
adam
how
when
why
and
where
to
pray
then
again
once
having
neglected
to
inform
his
first
model
about
all
this
since
he
is
omnipotent
he
would
certainly
have
instilled
into
the
minds
of
men
the
true
creed
so
that
no
doubt
could
have
ever
entered
into
any
one
mind
what
a
universe
of
suffering
he
would
have
saved
the
martian
is
aware
that
a
great
number
of
earthlings
hold
that
every
event
must
have
a
cause
therefore
the
universe
must
have
had
a
cause
which
cause
was
god
everything
as
it
now
exists
in
the
universe
is
the
result
of
an
infinite
series
of
causes
and
effects
everything
that
happens
is
the
result
of
something
else
that
happened
previously
and
so
on
backwards
to
all
eternity
applying
this
reasoning
that
everything
is
the
effect
of
some
cause
and
that
a
cause
is
the
effect
of
some
other
causes
the
theists
work
back
from
effect
to
cause
and
from
cause
to
effect
until
they
reach
a
first
cause
by
predicating
a
first
cause
however
the
theist
removes
the
mystery
a
stage
further
back
this
first
cause
they
assume
to
be
a
cause
that
was
not
caused
and
this
first
cause
is
god
such
a
belief
is
a
logical
absurdity
and
is
an
example
of
the
ancient
custom
of
creating
a
mystery
to
explain
a
mystery
if
everything
must
have
a
cause
then
the
first
cause
must
be
caused
and
therefore
who
made
god
to
say
that
this
first
cause
always
existed
is
to
deny
the
basic
assumption
of
this
theory
moreover
if
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
a
first
cause
as
having
always
existed
why
is
it
unreasonable
to
assume
that
the
materials
of
the
universe
always
existed
to
explain
the
unknown
by
the
known
is
a
logical
procedure
to
explain
the
known
by
the
unknown
is
a
form
of
theological
lunacy
the
effect
noted
in
any
particular
case
is
not
of
necessity
related
to
a
single
cause
and
science
gives
no
assurance
that
causes
and
effects
can
be
traced
backward
to
a
simple
first
cause
a
man
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
contract
pneumonia
what
is
the
cause
an
infection
of
the
respiratory
tract
by
the
pneumococcus
it
is
not
quite
so
simple
as
to
ultimate
causation
the
person
afflicted
was
harboring
these
germs
in
his
nose
and
throat
and
his
resistance
was
weakened
by
wetting
his
feet
the
day
was
cold
and
his
shoes
were
thin
the
humidity
and
temperature
were
such
that
rain
fell
the
temperature
and
humidity
were
caused
by
air
currents
hundreds
of
miles
distant
from
the
scene
and
so
ad
infinitum
in
this
series
of
complications
where
may
we
discern
a
first
cause
when
applied
to
the
much
more
difficult
problem
of
physical
phenomena
we
can
conceive
of
an
endless
cycle
of
causes
but
we
can
not
conceive
of
a
first
cause
cause
and
effect
are
not
two
separate
things
they
are
the
same
thing
viewed
under
two
separate
aspects
if
cause
and
effect
are
the
expressions
of
a
relation
and
if
they
are
not
two
things
but
only
one
under
two
aspects
being
the
name
for
the
related
powers
of
the
factors
and
the
name
for
their
assemblage
to
talk
as
does
the
theist
of
working
back
along
the
chain
of
causes
until
we
reach
god
is
nonsense
cohen
theism
or
atheism
a
great
many
theists
attempt
to
deduce
the
existence
of
an
invisible
creator
and
ruler
of
the
universe
from
the
visible
features
of
nature
such
as
the
design
regularity
of
movement
and
structure
and
the
various
aspects
of
beauty
which
one
may
find
in
studying
natural
objects
this
argument
from
design
in
nature
has
been
overruled
by
a
study
of
the
evolutionary
processes
paley
based
his
argument
on
the
assertion
of
a
mind
behind
phenomena
the
workings
of
which
could
be
seen
in
the
forms
of
animal
life
the
theists
no
longer
use
original
arguments
but
a
great
deal
of
the
theistic
arguments
are
still
based
on
his
assumptions
from
the
humanistic
point
of
view
and
the
theist
bases
his
entire
arguments
from
design
in
nature
from
the
humanistic
view
an
understanding
of
the
merciless
character
of
organic
evolution
shows
clearly
that
the
forces
at
work
in
nature
are
full
of
waste
there
are
numerous
plans
that
are
futile
there
is
an
unrelenting
preying
of
one
form
of
life
upon
the
other
and
it
is
not
always
the
higher
form
that
is
victor
there
are
myriads
of
living
organisms
coming
to
life
only
to
perish
before
reaching
an
age
at
which
they
can
play
their
part
in
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
and
there
is
a
universe
of
pain
and
misery
that
serves
no
useful
purpose
the
impartial
eye
of
science
observes
ugliness
as
well
as
beauty
disorder
as
well
as
order
in
nature
if
there
is
evidence
of
design
in
a
rose
there
is
at
least
as
much
evidence
of
design
in
the
tubercle
bacillus
and
the
tetanus
bacillus
whatever
in
nature
produced
the
peacock
produced
the
whatever
produced
man
produced
the
spirochete
of
syphilis
if
this
earth
is
evolving
for
the
better
the
past
is
still
vivid
in
all
its
cruelty
the
old
and
familiar
argument
from
design
and
beauty
in
nature
is
so
inconsistent
with
the
facts
at
hand
that
most
theists
have
abandoned
this
attitude
and
the
retreat
from
this
position
has
been
turned
into
a
veritable
rout
by
the
steady
advance
of
scientific
knowledge
god
could
by
exercising
his
omnipotence
reveal
his
existence
with
overpowering
conviction
at
any
moment
yet
men
have
been
searching
for
centuries
for
just
the
slightest
evidence
of
his
presence
the
martian
moreover
holds
that
the
entire
argument
is
irrelevant
for
even
if
he
grants
that
there
is
a
supernatural
being
that
fashions
that
which
we
behold
at
work
in
the
universe
how
can
we
say
that
he
designed
all
this
without
first
knowing
what
his
intention
was
only
by
knowing
the
intention
in
the
mind
of
a
supernatural
being
before
the
act
can
we
infer
that
something
was
designed
when
the
theist
finds
intention
and
design
in
nature
he
is
but
reading
his
own
feeling
and
desires
into
nature
considering
the
universe
as
a
whole
the
martian
fails
to
find
anything
that
suggests
a
conscious
and
purposive
god
and
certainly
nothing
to
suggest
a
being
that
considers
the
welfare
of
man
the
individual
is
not
much
interested
in
god
as
manifested
in
nature
what
he
is
vainly
seeking
is
as
he
is
seeking
an
intelligence
that
his
clergy
tell
him
is
devoted
to
his
welfare
an
intelligence
that
will
guide
his
stumbling
efforts
that
will
relieve
him
from
war
and
misery
that
will
shield
the
innocent
from
pain
and
poverty
he
finds
that
his
clergy
can
not
point
to
one
clear
trace
of
the
action
of
god
in
human
affairs
in
the
whole
long
record
of
man
career
the
finger
of
god
can
not
be
found
pointing
to
one
fact
the
martian
considers
the
theistic
argument
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
have
an
orderly
universe
merely
resulting
from
the
inherent
properties
of
natural
forces
and
that
directivity
is
necessary
to
keep
the
universe
on
its
present
track
keeping
in
mind
the
scientific
conception
of
the
universe
and
the
knowledge
at
hand
concerning
the
atoms
and
their
properties
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
other
arrangement
than
the
present
one
should
have
resulted
the
martian
can
not
marvel
as
most
earthlings
do
that
the
present
order
exists
as
it
does
the
marvel
to
him
would
be
if
any
other
order
should
be
or
that
any
radical
alteration
in
it
should
occur
he
perceives
that
the
state
of
the
universe
at
any
moment
is
the
result
of
all
the
conditions
then
prevailing
and
that
the
natural
forces
possess
the
capacity
to
produce
the
universe
as
we
see
it
it
matters
not
what
the
ultimate
nature
of
these
forces
may
be
electrons
protons
electricity
or
wave
energy
these
material
forces
possess
the
capacity
to
produce
the
universe
as
we
see
it
if
these
forces
do
not
possess
this
capacity
it
is
indeed
difficult
for
the
martian
to
conceive
in
what
way
even
a
directing
and
supreme
mathematician
an
ultimate
or
any
supernatural
power
however
designated
could
produce
this
capacity
unless
the
capacity
for
producing
the
universe
as
we
see
it
existed
in
the
atoms
themselves
no
amount
of
direction
could
have
produced
it
the
property
of
the
atom
and
its
combinations
to
produce
the
material
universe
is
therefore
inherent
in
the
atoms
themselves
and
does
not
necessitate
the
operation
of
a
deity
the
order
manifest
in
the
universe
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
persistence
of
force
if
a
supernatural
intelligent
force
existed
the
martian
believes
that
the
claims
of
the
theist
could
in
no
way
be
better
substantiated
than
if
this
controlling
force
would
in
some
way
manifest
an
inhibitive
influence
and
prevent
certain
things
occurring
which
would
have
transpired
but
for
his
interference
such
manifestations
have
not
occurred
it
is
impossible
for
the
theist
to
show
any
instance
in
which
the
normal
consequences
of
known
forces
did
not
transpire
in
which
the
aberration
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
the
operation
of
other
known
forces
a
law
of
nature
is
not
a
statute
drawn
up
by
a
legislator
it
is
the
interpretation
and
the
summation
which
we
give
to
the
observed
facts
the
phenomena
which
we
observe
do
not
act
in
a
particular
manner
because
there
is
a
law
but
we
state
the
law
because
they
act
in
that
particular
manner
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
laws
of
nature
are
the
result
of
a
lawmaker
it
can
not
be
affirmed
that
a
supreme
intelligence
told
things
in
nature
to
act
just
that
way
and
no
other
if
the
theist
claims
that
a
supreme
intelligence
issued
laws
for
his
own
pleasure
and
without
any
reason
then
he
must
admit
that
there
is
something
which
is
not
subject
to
law
and
the
train
of
natural
law
is
interrupted
if
it
is
claimed
that
a
supreme
intelligence
had
a
reason
for
the
laws
which
he
gave
the
reason
being
to
create
the
best
possible
universe
then
it
follows
that
god
himself
was
subject
to
law
and
there
is
no
advantage
in
introducing
god
as
an
intermediary
this
contention
would
make
it
appear
that
there
is
a
law
outside
and
anterior
to
the
divine
edicts
and
god
does
not
serve
the
purpose
of
the
theist
since
he
is
not
the
ultimate
lawgiver
the
anthropomorphic
conception
of
god
our
martian
finds
is
now
denied
by
most
cultured
theists
nevertheless
they
still
maintain
a
belief
in
a
deity
endowed
with
consciousness
professor
wieman
states
that
god
is
superhuman
but
not
supernatural
he
is
a
present
potent
operative
observable
reality
he
is
more
worthy
of
love
than
any
other
beloved
he
is
one
to
whom
men
can
pray
and
do
pray
and
who
answers
prayer
this
can
be
understood
to
be
not
greatly
removed
from
the
fundamentalists
conception
of
god
but
when
he
continues
to
say
god
is
that
interaction
between
individuals
groups
and
ages
which
generates
and
promotes
the
greatest
possible
mutuality
of
good
and
it
responds
to
prayer
and
is
precisely
what
answers
prayer
when
prayer
is
answered
the
personal
he
has
suddenly
changed
to
the
unpersonal
it
emotions
and
intelligence
are
connected
with
nerve
structures
in
all
sentient
beings
that
we
have
experience
and
knowledge
of
how
can
we
attribute
these
qualities
to
a
being
who
is
described
to
us
as
devoid
of
any
nerve
structure
in
former
ages
the
theist
saw
god
in
the
color
and
construction
of
a
flower
in
the
starry
heavens
and
in
a
sunset
or
sunrise
the
biologists
have
driven
the
theists
from
this
misconception
the
physicists
have
explained
the
phenomena
of
sunset
and
sunrise
and
with
the
advance
of
astronomy
the
heavens
no
longer
proclaim
the
glory
of
god
and
the
theistic
arguments
have
shifted
from
worlds
to
atoms
at
the
present
moment
the
vision
of
god
has
narrowed
down
to
a
perception
of
the
divine
intelligence
noted
in
the
design
of
the
atom
astronomy
physics
geology
chemistry
medicine
psychology
ethics
aesthetics
and
the
social
sciences
have
left
no
room
for
a
theistic
explanation
of
the
universe
the
mystics
who
proclaim
god
in
their
intuitive
trances
are
being
crowded
out
into
the
light
of
reason
by
the
researches
of
psychologists
there
are
still
many
gaps
in
our
knowledge
and
if
the
theist
persists
in
finding
the
manifestation
of
a
supreme
being
in
these
vague
zones
of
our
present
ignorance
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
science
of
the
future
science
is
concerned
with
mind
as
much
as
it
is
with
the
material
aspects
of
atoms
and
stars
hence
the
sciences
of
psychology
ethics
and
aesthetics
the
entire
universe
is
the
province
of
science
and
it
is
rapidly
providing
a
scientific
interpretation
of
all
the
contents
of
the
universe
it
may
well
be
a
few
more
centuries
before
the
scientific
explanation
is
partially
complete
but
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
science
as
we
conceive
the
term
is
less
than
years
old
and
out
of
this
infantile
period
at
least
years
must
be
deducted
for
the
intellectual
stagnation
of
the
dark
ages
in
tracing
the
retreat
of
the
clergy
from
the
arguments
from
the
first
cause
the
arguments
from
design
causation
and
directivity
the
martian
recalls
the
words
of
vivian
phelips
how
is
it
that
god
allowed
earnest
and
learned
divines
to
commit
themselves
to
arguments
in
proof
of
his
existence
the
subsequent
overthrow
of
which
has
been
a
potent
cause
for
unbelief
the
finite
mind
can
not
expect
to
understand
the
infinite
retorts
a
theist
to
our
martian
what
manner
of
reasoning
is
this
asks
our
martian
that
denies
my
finite
mind
the
right
to
question
the
of
the
existence
of
an
infinite
when
these
same
are
derived
by
finite
minds
the
theist
can
not
infer
god
from
the
cosmic
process
until
he
can
discover
some
feature
of
it
which
is
unintelligible
without
him
the
belief
in
a
deity
but
the
rejection
of
revelations
theology
priestcraft
and
church
to
the
martian
the
opinion
held
by
these
individuals
presented
two
difficulties
first
if
the
adherents
of
this
hypothesis
considered
their
deity
as
a
providence
which
took
an
active
part
in
the
life
of
this
world
then
the
objections
heretofore
stated
against
belief
in
a
personal
god
are
still
valid
secondly
if
they
considered
this
being
as
only
a
creator
who
then
leaves
this
world
to
its
own
resources
they
are
only
assuming
a
philosophical
existence
behind
phenomena
such
a
being
they
believe
they
deduce
intellectually
but
actually
who
created
this
creator
they
assume
a
god
who
remains
always
hidden
behind
phenomena
but
such
a
god
has
no
connection
with
the
god
that
the
religious
man
worships
and
to
whom
he
prays
for
guidance
and
for
blessings
for
actual
interference
in
the
life
of
this
world
such
theories
impress
our
visitor
as
but
a
feeble
attempt
at
new
concepts
of
the
same
hypothetical
deity
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
we
already
had
sufficient
ideas
of
god
to
trouble
our
earthly
minds
the
god
of
the
physicists
it
was
brought
to
the
martian
attention
that
two
scientists
sir
arthur
eddington
a
british
astronomer
and
sir
james
jeans
a
mathematical
physicist
had
still
another
concept
of
god
according
to
eddington
phenomena
all
boil
down
to
a
scheme
of
symbols
of
mathematical
equations
he
admits
that
this
mathematics
of
nature
does
not
explain
anything
they
do
not
define
reality
they
only
define
the
relations
that
exist
between
the
phenomena
of
reality
so
far
does
he
go
and
then
his
limited
mind
our
martian
perceives
meets
an
obstacle
that
he
can
not
explain
he
therefore
abandons
the
formula
and
returns
to
the
human
mind
which
has
conceived
this
formula
from
the
spiritual
essence
of
man
nature
he
assumes
the
spiritual
nature
of
the
cosmos
itself
which
he
finds
in
what
religion
has
known
for
centuries
as
god
to
him
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
universe
except
in
terms
of
spirit
professor
jeans
insists
that
in
the
equations
which
reveal
the
relations
between
phenomena
there
may
reside
also
the
revelation
of
the
ultimate
which
these
phenomena
express
he
believes
that
there
may
exist
a
great
architect
of
the
universe
who
is
a
pure
mathematician
however
the
martian
argues
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
your
earthly
experience
you
have
created
your
gods
in
your
own
image
your
savages
created
god
in
the
only
fashion
their
mental
capacities
could
supply
in
the
shape
of
an
idol
now
the
modern
physicist
creates
his
god
in
the
light
of
his
own
intimate
vision
which
is
that
of
a
mathematician
this
is
just
another
attempt
to
formulate
an
hypothetical
existence
of
a
supernatural
being
the
theologians
by
this
time
thoroughly
aroused
lay
down
a
verbal
barrage
and
learned
jesuits
place
before
the
visitor
a
recent
publication
entitled
the
question
and
answer
by
hilaire
belloc
the
author
acting
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
roman
catholic
church
attempts
to
prove
two
things
namely
whether
god
is
and
that
the
witness
to
revelation
is
the
roman
catholic
church
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
work
was
published
by
permission
of
the
church
one
could
logically
suppose
from
its
arguments
that
the
author
was
attempting
to
give
the
answer
no
to
the
question
propounded
as
to
whether
god
is
there
is
one
sentence
however
to
which
the
martian
agrees
this
one
but
religions
though
not
very
numerous
considering
the
vast
spaces
of
time
over
which
we
can
study
them
and
the
vast
number
of
millions
to
which
they
apply
differ
and
contradict
each
other
on
which
account
any
one
approaching
this
problem
for
the
first
time
and
being
made
acquainted
at
the
outset
with
the
variety
of
religions
would
naturally
conclude
that
every
religion
is
and
every
religion
an
illusion
on
reading
the
opening
remarks
the
martian
exclaims
this
earthling
plainly
tells
us
at
the
beginning
that
he
will
make
his
theories
fit
in
with
his
conclusion
he
informs
us
that
he
does
not
seek
the
truth
no
matter
where
it
may
lead
but
he
only
deems
it
necessary
to
fit
ideas
no
matter
how
distorted
in
order
that
the
final
conclusion
will
simulate
what
he
deliberately
sets
out
to
prove
belloc
statement
how
many
men
will
agree
that
wanton
cruelty
treason
to
family
or
the
state
falsehood
for
private
gain
breach
of
faith
are
admirable
strikes
the
martian
as
absurd
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
historical
annals
of
the
church
itself
belloc
creed
must
have
considered
these
very
vices
as
virtues
judging
from
the
actions
of
his
church
in
calling
the
roman
catholic
church
the
witness
to
revelation
the
author
continues
with
yet
that
it
should
suffer
from
men
hatred
and
persecution
if
god
has
divinely
ordained
this
institution
as
his
church
on
earth
and
in
his
omnipotence
and
omniscience
allows
this
church
to
be
hated
then
how
do
the
religionists
assume
that
their
god
is
a
god
of
love
the
author
tells
us
that
he
is
a
god
of
hate
such
a
god
as
was
conceived
of
by
the
barbarians
and
the
hebrews
cruel
vengeful
and
monstrous
does
not
this
apologist
confuse
his
god
with
his
devil
then
again
has
it
not
occurred
to
this
apologist
that
he
is
in
all
futility
attempting
to
prove
something
which
is
a
contradiction
within
itself
if
god
is
and
is
benevolent
is
it
not
logical
to
assume
since
the
theologians
assume
all
sorts
of
attributes
to
this
deity
that
he
would
not
have
constructed
the
minds
of
men
when
he
created
them
so
as
to
desire
to
doubt
his
being
would
not
have
tortured
the
minds
of
men
with
cruel
doubt
as
to
his
existence
if
he
is
omnipotent
it
would
have
been
just
as
easy
to
instill
into
the
minds
of
men
only
the
strongest
desire
to
believe
in
his
reality
and
even
that
would
not
be
necessary
had
he
so
arranged
matters
that
by
his
everlasting
presence
he
would
reveal
himself
or
his
deeds
to
man
in
such
a
conclusive
manner
that
even
the
feeblest
of
intellects
could
not
doubt
his
existence
if
he
is
omniscient
as
the
parable
asserts
that
not
a
hair
falls
from
the
head
of
man
not
a
sparrow
dies
without
his
knowledge
it
must
therefore
be
apparent
that
he
created
man
with
the
foreknowledge
that
man
would
doubt
his
existence
this
is
a
contradiction
in
itself
the
martian
notes
that
in
the
entire
length
of
the
work
not
a
reference
is
made
to
the
theological
defense
the
revelation
which
the
church
has
always
claimed
for
its
scriptures
appended
as
an
afterthought
as
an
apology
as
it
were
for
the
philosophical
defense
and
not
the
theological
the
jesuit
father
reminds
the
reader
of
its
messiah
jesus
and
the
new
testament
the
jesuit
states
the
new
testament
writings
considered
merely
as
trustworthy
historical
documents
inform
us
that
but
at
this
point
the
martian
interrupted
the
speaker
for
the
audacity
of
any
learned
man
terming
the
new
testament
writings
historical
was
beyond
his
comprehension
it
brought
forcibly
to
his
attention
the
great
change
which
the
apologies
for
the
church
had
undergone
and
the
new
methods
which
they
assumed
the
old
theological
defense
of
the
deity
was
gone
not
even
philosophy
was
deemed
strong
enough
support
for
the
present
day
how
the
church
had
fallen
the
church
which
had
persecuted
anathematized
burned
and
tortured
the
scientist
the
geologist
the
astronomer
the
geographer
the
biologist
the
chemist
and
the
physician
this
same
church
in
its
last
extremus
casts
aside
theology
as
its
weapon
and
its
appeal
to
the
minds
of
the
sceptics
whom
they
aim
to
convert
the
church
casts
aside
its
own
theology
having
learned
by
bitter
experience
and
recanting
of
opinions
bulls
and
infallible
statements
by
infallible
popes
and
now
succumbs
to
the
opinions
it
has
formerly
anathematized
in
the
present
age
the
church
calls
science
to
its
aid
and
utterly
disregards
its
obsolete
theology
which
it
still
practices
and
attempts
by
means
of
the
misinterpretation
of
scientific
facts
and
statements
of
a
few
men
such
as
eddington
and
jeans
to
force
science
into
some
illogical
and
unscientific
concordance
with
the
conception
of
a
supreme
being
ironically
it
occurs
to
the
martian
that
the
shades
of
hypatia
bruno
galileo
copernicus
vanini
darwin
and
the
vast
numbers
of
waldenses
albigenses
huguenots
jews
and
the
victims
of
the
inquisition
and
the
witch
hunt
must
as
they
contemplate
the
present
tactics
of
that
holy
institution
the
church
find
some
consolation
in
the
depths
of
that
hell
to
which
the
church
consigned
them
the
martian
logically
deduces
that
by
employing
science
for
its
defense
the
church
admits
the
impotence
of
divine
revelation
in
this
age
to
convince
even
its
own
adherents
of
the
problematical
existence
of
a
divine
being
is
no
longer
recognized
as
authoritative
even
by
theologians
will
the
theologians
now
discard
their
theology
based
on
the
supernatural
and
build
a
system
of
theology
based
on
science
is
this
all
that
is
left
to
the
theologian
that
he
must
use
the
pitiful
theology
of
gaps
that
is
wherever
there
are
gaps
in
scientific
knowledge
the
theologians
insert
their
idea
of
god
this
is
but
the
replacing
of
the
question

with
a
meaningless
label

llewelyn
powys
the
martian
has
had
his
attention
drawn
to
the
statement
that
religion
in
some
form
or
other
has
existed
from
most
primitive
times
down
to
the
present
day
the
theologians
point
to
this
as
a
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
an
investigation
of
this
assertion
leads
the
martian
to
the
conclusion
that
religions
have
continued
to
exist
mainly
because
of
the
power
which
inherited
superstitions
wield
over
mankind
men
are
born
with
a
marked
tendency
towards
superstitions
certain
isolated
families
of
men
are
born
with
an
inherited
tendency
towards
tuberculosis
most
of
these
are
born
not
with
an
active
tuberculosis
but
some
as
yet
imperfectly
understood
tendency
a
defect
in
their
protoplasmic
that
renders
them
an
easy
prey
to
the
tubercle
bacillus
if
they
are
exposed
to
it
similarly
generations
of
men
have
been
born
with
a
weakened
mental
vitality
towards
superstition
a
weakened
mental
capacity
that
renders
their
minds
an
easy
prey
to
that
fear
which
manifests
itself
in
superstition
creed
religion
the
it
was
karl
marx
who
remarked
that
the
tradition
of
all
the
generations
of
the
past
weighs
down
like
an
alp
upon
the
brain
of
the
living
since
the
days
of
our
racial
childhood
our
beliefs
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
and
they
have
persisted
since
in
all
ages
it
was
forbidden
to
question
their
existence
man
has
persuaded
himself
that
it
is
so
just
because
he
has
said
it
for
so
long
and
so
often
the
force
of
repetition
is
great
it
is
in
fact
taken
by
a
vast
majority
of
men
as
the
equivalent
of
proof
most
men
have
to
accept
their
religions
ready
made
their
daily
tasks
leave
them
no
time
or
opportunity
for
a
personal
search
the
toil
for
bread
is
incessant
there
is
not
sufficient
leisure
to
verify
the
sources
of
their
religious
beliefs
moreover
the
ecclesiastic
answers
to
the
riddles
of
life
are
easier
by
far
to
grasp
than
the
answers
of
science
these
two
factors
of
innate
mental
inertia
and
force
of
repetition
are
well
manifested
by
the
present
tactics
of
advertising
the
manufacturer
of
any
product
well
knows
that
constant
repetition
and
the
dangling
of
his
product
before
the
eyes
of
the
public
will
lead
to
a
widespread
acceptance
of
the
advertising
slogans
propounded
for
his
article
the
force
of
authority
has
aggravated
this
mental
inertia
it
takes
a
tremendous
amount
of
will
power
and
mental
courage
for
any
individual
to
assert
an
opinion
that
runs
counter
to
the
accepted
mode
of
thinking
it
is
much
easier
and
much
more
pleasant
to
give
oneself
passively
to
that
delusion
of
grandeur
that
delusion
that
pleasantly
drugs
the
mind
with
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
supreme
being
who
is
personally
interested
in
our
a
providence
who
like
a
school
master
at
his
pleasure
dispenses
rewards
and
punishments
as
immortality
heaven
and
hell
so
firmly
has
this
become
entrenched
in
the
minds
of
men
that
the
irrationalities
which
manifest
themselves
against
such
a
conception
make
no
impression
schopenhauer
well
states
nothing
is
more
provoking
when
we
are
arguing
against
a
man
with
reasons
and
explanations
and
taking
all
pains
to
convince
him
than
to
discover
at
last
that
he
not
understand
that
we
have
to
do
with
his
the
martian
knowing
the
widespread
extent
of
religious
beliefs
and
their
supposed
influence
in
our
daily
lives
is
prepared
to
find
in
our
annals
a
vast
literature
that
would
attest
to
the
overwhelming
benefits
that
mankind
had
derived
from
his
religious
beliefs
he
is
amazed
to
find
that
the
little
good
which
religion
had
accomplished
had
occurred
at
the
time
when
our
race
was
in
its
infancy
just
as
fear
is
instilled
into
the
mind
of
the
child
to
protect
it
from
the
dangers
of
its
environment
before
the
child
has
reached
the
age
when
it
can
use
its
reason
for
protection
just
so
had
religion
by
its
implantation
of
fear
served
its
purpose
in
the
days
of
our
racial
childhood
the
child
however
as
soon
as
it
learns
to
reason
replaces
those
fears
by
a
logical
comprehension
of
the
laws
governing
his
environment
but
in
religious
matters
this
fear
has
clung
to
man
tenaciously
and
while
at
first
serving
a
protective
function
at
the
present
stage
of
civilization
constitutes
an
embryonic
impediment
the
assertion
of
ecclesiastics
that
without
the
aid
of
religious
learning
and
influence
our
civilization
would
have
been
retarded
is
a
statement
that
a
study
of
the
development
of
man
shows
to
be
directly
opposed
to
the
facts
that
religion
has
been
the
greatest
impediment
in
the
road
to
progress
this
will
be
shown
in
the
subsequent
chapters
the
assertion
that
during
the
middle
ages
ecclesiastic
influence
was
the
saving
grace
is
well
refuted
by
william
robinson
we
are
told
by
the
church
apologists
that
during
the
middle
ages
the
priests
and
monks
kept
up
the
torch
of
learning
that
being
the
only
literate
people
they
brought
back
the
study
of
the
classics
historically
speaking
this
is
about
the
most
impudent
statement
that
one
could
imagine
it
was
the
church
that
retarded
human
progress
at
least
one
thousand
years
it
is
the
church
that
put
a
thick
impenetrable
pall
over
the
sun
of
learning
and
science
so
that
humanity
was
enveloped
in
utter
darkness
and
if
the
priests
and
monks
later
learned
to
read
and
write
from
the
arabs
jews
and
greeks
exiled
from
constantinople
after
it
is
because
they
wanted
to
keep
the
power
in
their
hands
the
people
they
did
not
permit
to
learn
either
to
read
or
write
the
reading
of
the
bible
bear
in
mind
was
considered
a
we
are
told
that
the
priests
and
monks
built
hospitals
and
gave
alms
to
the
poor
having
gotten
enormous
tracts
of
the
best
land
into
their
hands
so
that
the
people
were
starving
they
were
willing
to
throw
a
bone
occasionally
to
the
latter
it
cost
them
nothing
and
it
gave
them
a
reputation
for
charity
they
built
enormous
monasteries
with
well
filled
cellars
and
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
while
the
people
lived
in
wretched
hovels
working
their
lives
away
for
a
crust
of
bread
the
beasts
the
domestic
animals
lived
a
more
comfortable
life
than
did
the
men
women
and
children
of
the
people
and
the
church
never
never
raised
a
finger
to
ameliorate
their
condition
it
kept
them
in
superstitious
darkness
and
helped
the
temporal
lords
for
a
long
period
the
spiritual
were
also
the
temporal
lords
to
keep
them
in
fear
subjection
and
slavery
the
martian
being
an
impartial
observer
examined
what
had
been
done
by
christianity
for
the
intellectual
and
material
advancement
of
humanity
during
her
long
reign
and
what
had
been
done
by
science
and
purely
secular
knowledge
in
its
brief
period
of
activity
the
period
when
science
and
secular
knowledge
had
partially
liberated
themselves
from
ecclesiastical
domination
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
instituting
a
comparison
he
had
established
a
contrast
chapter
vi
religion
and
science
then
commands
our
respect
not
on
the
basis
that
its
present
assumptions
and
deductions
are
absolutely
and
for
all
time
true
but
on
the
ground
that
its
method
is
for
all
time
true
the
method
of

the
method
of

the
war
on
modern
science
the
bare
three
and
centuries
since
modern
science
began
the
churches
had
conducted
an
unremitting
crusade
against
it
that
much
of
this
crusade
had
turned
into
a
action
was
due
less
to
the
weakness
of
the
defenders
of
the
faith
than
to
the
invulnerability
of
their
horace
kallen
why
religion
some
sixty
years
ago
in
the
dogmatic
constitution
of
the
catholic
faith
the
church
stated
but
never
can
reason
be
rendered
capable
of
thoroughly
understanding
mysteries
as
it
does
those
truths
which
form
its
proper
subject
we
therefore
pronounce
false
every
assertion
which
is
contrary
to
the
enlightened
truth
of
faith
hence
all
the
christian
faithful
are
not
only
forbidden
to
defend
as
legitimate
conclusions
of
science
those
opinions
which
are
known
to
be
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
faith
especially
when
condemned
by
the
church
but
are
rather
absolutely
bound
to
hold
them
for
errors
wearing
the
deceitful
appearance
of
truth
let
him
be
anathema
who
shall
say
that
human
sciences
ought
to
be
pursued
in
such
a
spirit
of
freedom
that
one
may
be
allowed
to
hold
true
their
assertions
even
when
opposed
to
revealed
doctrine
can
anything
stronger
be
said
to
discourage
research
investigation
experiment
and
retard
progress
and
only
sixty
years
ago
it
is
but
the
restatement
of
what
the
church
has
uttered
so
many
times
and
for
so
long
that
all
knowledge
material
as
well
as
spiritual
is
to
be
found
in
the
bible
as
interpreted
by
the
church
it
was
this
myth
which
had
stultified
the
mind
of
man
for
years
during
the
period
in
which
the
church
was
dominant
it
was
this
that
had
killed
the
urge
to
search
and
seek
for
the
truth
which
is
the
goal
of
all
science
the
means
by
which
humanity
is
set
on
the
road
to
progress
this
was
the
damnable
precept
foisted
on
the
minds
of
men
which
enslaved
them
throughout
the
ages
and
from
which
we
are
just
emerging
this
was
the
precept
that
plunged
the
world
into
the
dark
ages
and
retarded
the
advance
of
mankind
for
centuries
this
is
the
reason
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
the
intellectually
honest
scientist
and
for
that
matter
any
individual
to
reconcile
science
with
religion
on
the
one
hand
that
of
religion
we
have
the
forces
of
intolerance
superstition
and
the
endeavor
to
besmirch
repress
and
ridicule
every
advance
favorable
to
mankind
to
cloak
with
meaningless
words
obsolete
rites
to
stand
in
the
way
of
human
progress
because
it
does
not
permit
men
to
think
boldly
and
logically
science
on
the
other
hand
does
not
hesitate
to
tear
down
old
conceptions
and
has
only
one
motive
the
ultimate
truth
religion
has
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
masses
in
the
narrow
and
false
path
of
only
accepted
doctrines
the
true
scientist
is
the
man
with
the
open
mind
one
who
will
discard
the
worthless
and
accept
only
the
proven
good
the
religionist
closes
his
mind
to
all
facts
which
he
is
unwilling
to
believe
everything
which
will
endanger
his
creed
religion
teaches
the
individual
to
place
all
hope
all
desire
in
a
problematical
hereafter
the
stay
on
earth
is
so
short
compared
to
the
everlasting
life
to
come
that
of
what
interest
is
this
life
all
things
are
vain
the
misery
the
suffering
of
his
fellow
men
leave
him
cold
he
can
only
think
of
living
in
the
light
of
his
narrow
creed
so
that
he
may
gain
his
future
reward
how
well
this
philosophy
has
fitted
in
with
the
schemes
of
the
select
few
for
the
control
of
the
many
truth
to
the
scientific
mind
is
something
provisional
a
hypothesis
that
for
the
present
moment
best
conforms
to
the
recognized
tests
it
is
an
evolving
conception
in
a
constantly
changing
universe
it
is
not
that
science
has
attained
true
conclusions
not
that
the
evidence
at
hand
must
remain
immutable
but
that
the
scientific
method
of
analyzing
and
formulating
assumptions
on
the
basis
of
discovery
on
ascertained
facts
is
a
superior
method
to
the
closed
infallible
method
of
revelation
these
assumptions
based
upon
the
known
facts
lead
to
a
working
hypothesis
which
in
turn
develops
into
a
theory
if
the
theory
is
adopted
it
must
account
for
the
facts
known
but
the
theory
is
not
held
as
final
it
is
always
changed
or
abandoned
if
necessary
to
conform
to
the
new
discovered
data
science
welcomes
the
critical
attitude
that
leads
to
the
refinement
of
its
theories
there
may
be
today
various
theories
held
by
scientists
in
which
they
are
mistaken
but
the
question
of
the
by
which
they
arrive
at
conclusions
can
no
longer
be
under
consideration
with
regard
to
its
validity
to
the
scientific
mind
knowledge
is
something
to
be
arrived
at
by
study
and
research
to
the
religionist
knowledge
is
something
that
is
contained
in
an
infallible
and
supernatural
statement
or
insight
religion
exalts
the
transcendental
science
manipulates
only
the
material
to
the
consistent
religionist
his
belief
as
such
determine
the
fact
to
the
scientist
it
is
the
evidence
that
establishes
the
fact
to
the
religionist
truth
is
something
that
is
unchanging
that
is
fixed
final
and
heretical
to
question
confronted
with
a
constantly
changing
universe
he
would
delude
himself
that
his
inner
convictions
give
him
a
finality
concerning
his
evolving
environment
it
is
therefore
not
so
much
science
that
the
religionist
is
fighting
but
the
this
scientific
method
of
approach
he
rightly
perceives
has
so
pervaded
our
mode
of
thinking
that
it
is
the
subtle
and
most
disintegrating
force
that
is
shattering
the
religious
foundations
james
shotwell
speaking
of
the
scientific
method
concludes
but
whatever
strictures
philosophy
may
pass
upon
the
of
science
as
merely
relative
and
provisional
there
is
no
clearer
fact
in
the
history
of
thought
that
its
and
have
been
at
opposite
poles
from
those
of
religion
it
does
no
good
to
blink
the
fact
established
as
it
is
by
the
most
positive
proofs
of
history
and
psychology
science
has
made
headway
by
attempting
to
eliminate
mystery
so
far
as
it
can
religion
on
the
other
hand
has
stressed
mystery
and
accepted
it
in
its
own
terms
science
is
the
product
of
bold
adventure
pushing
into
the
realm
of
the
mysterious
to
interpret
its
phenomena
in
terms
of
the
investigator
religion
enters
this
same
realm
to
give
itself
up
to
the
emotional
reactions
science
is
the
embodiment
of
the
sense
of
control
religion
yields
the
control
to
that
power
which
moves
in
the
shadow
of
the
woods
by
night
and
the
glory
of
the
morning
hills
science
does
not
justify
by
faith
but
by
works
it
is
the
living
denial
of
that
acceptance
which
we
accord
to
the
mystery
as
such
it
renounces
authority
cuts
athwart
custom
violates
the
sacred
rejects
the
myths
it
adjusts
itself
to
the
process
of
change
whose
creative
impulse
it
itself
supplies
not
but
is
the
keynote
of
science
each
discovery
of
something
new
involves
the
discarding
of
something
old
above
all
it
progresses
by
doubting
rather
than
by
believing
shotwell
the
religious
revolution
of
has
never
been
an
advance
in
science
of
widespread
importance
which
in
some
manner
or
other
endangered
some
mouldy
religious
concept
that
the
church
has
not
bitterly
opposed
an
advance
which
in
time
has
proven
of
inestimable
benefit
for
all
mankind
a
glance
at
the
history
of
human
progress
will
reveal
scores
of
such
the
two
rival
divisions
of
the
christian
church
protestant
and
catholic
have
always
been
in
accord
on
one
point
that
is
to
tolerate
no
science
except
such
as
they
considered
to
be
agreeable
to
the
scriptures
it
was
the
decree
of
the
lateran
council
of
that
ordered
that
no
books
should
be
printed
but
such
as
had
been
inspected
by
the
ecclesiastical
censors
under
pain
of
excommunication
and
fine
it
is
easily
understood
that
having
declared
the
bible
to
contain
all
knowledge
both
scientific
and
spiritual
and
then
passing
a
decree
ordering
no
books
to
be
printed
which
did
not
agree
on
all
points
with
the
church
interpretation
of
the
bible
the
church
was
in
absolute
control
of
all
thought
both
written
and
spoken
it
was
to
no
advantage
for
the
scholar
to
investigate
any
new
fields
for
all
knowledge
which
was
possible
for
the
mind
to
discover
had
already
been
revealed
in
the
scriptures
thus
declared
the
church
we
understand
why
it
was
that
copernicus
did
not
permit
his
book
to
be
published
until
he
was
dying
we
understand
also
that
when
galileo
and
bruno
had
the
courage
of
their
convictions
and
gave
voice
to
their
beliefs
they
were
persecuted
galileo
was
made
to
recant
a
discovery
that
the
youngest
of
children
now
takes
for
granted
bruno
was
burnt
at
the
stake
we
know
that
astronomy
was
at
a
standstill
under
church
domination
chemistry
was
forbidden
and
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
was
contradicted
while
anthropology
which
showed
on
what
mythical
foundations
the
story
of
the
fall
of
man
rests
was
squelched
the
attitude
of
the
church
on
geography
was
hostile
to
the
truth
as
witness
the
persecutions
of
those
who
dared
to
venture
that
the
earth
was
round
botany
mathematics
and
geometry
as
well
as
the
natural
sciences
slumbered
geology
which
proved
that
the
earth
was
more
than
years
old
was
anathematized
archeologists
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
expound
the
truth
concerning
the
antiquity
of
the
human
race
in
purely
civil
matters
the
clergy
opposed
fire
and
marine
insurance
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
tempting
of
providence
life
insurance
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
interference
with
the
consequence
of
god
will
medicine
met
the
most
strenuous
of
opposition
it
is
impossible
in
this
short
study
to
analyze
the
specific
forms
of
retardation
which
the
church
exhibited
to
all
of
these
branches
of
learning
whose
only
endeavor
it
was
to
search
for
the
truth
to
state
the
facts
and
to
alleviate
and
make
more
bearable
man
sojourn
on
this
earth
however
a
few
of
the
many
instances
of
retardation
on
the
part
of
the
church
will
be
pointed
out
chapter
vii
religion
and
medicine
when
physiologists
study
the
living
brain
of
an
ape
they
have
no
grounds
for
supposing
that
they
are
dealing
with
a
dual
structure
the
brain
is
not
a
tenement
inhabited
by
a
spirit
or
soul
the
spirit
or
soul
is
but
a
name
for
the
manifestations
of
the
living
brain
the
leading
neurologists
of
the
world
are
agreed
that
the
same
is
true
of
the
human
brain
it
was
only
when
they
abandoned
the
dual
conception
an
inheritance
from
the
dark
ages
of
medicine
that
they
began
to
understand
the
disorders
of
man
mind
and
how
to
treat
medicine
thus
strikes
at
the
very
root
of
christian
doctrine
for
if
man
is
truly
mortal
if
death
ends
all
if
the
human
soul
is
but
the
manifestation
of
the
living
brain
as
light
and
heat
are
the
manifestations
of
a
glowing
bar
of
steel
then
there
can
be
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
man
has
the
seeds
of
immortality
in
him
but
the
gift
is
for
the
race
not
for
the
sir
arthur
keith
medicine
and
religion
have
been
closely
associated
from
the
most
pristine
time
primitive
medicine
had
its
origin
in
conjunction
with
the
most
primitive
of
religious
conceptions
namely
animism
an
illusion
that
made
primitive
man
recognize
in
all
things
and
everywhere
spirits
such
as
his
supposed
spirit
a
belief
that
the
world
swarms
with
invisible
spirits
which
are
the
cause
of
disease
and
death
and
thus
primitive
medicine
is
inseparable
from
primitive
modes
of
religious
belief
all
these
phenomena
which
we
consider
today
natural
the
rustling
of
leaves
in
a
forest
the
crash
of
thunder
the
flash
of
lightning
winds
clouds
storms
and
earthquakes
were
to
primitive
man
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
angry
gods
demons
and
spirits
similar
spirits
caused
disease
and
death
and
these
evil
spirits
that
produced
disease
and
death
were
to
be
placated
and
cajoled
by
man
just
as
he
did
his
other
deities
by
magic
by
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifice
the
first
holy
man
the
first
priest
was
the
shaman
and
it
was
his
duty
not
only
to
placate
and
cajole
the
spirits
that
were
thought
to
control
the
physical
of
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe
but
it
was
his
duty
also
by
the
exercise
of
his
magic
to
alleviate
and
cure
illness
by
exorcism
the
shaman
was
therefore
the
first
medicine
man
the
first
witch
doctor
the
first
physician
he
relied
chiefly
upon
psychotherapy
as
does
the
modern
witch
doctor
of
christian
science
medicine
could
not
begin
to
be
medicine
until
it
was
disassociated
from
magic
religion
and
theology
this
struggle
has
been
going
on
from
the
time
of
the
shaman
to
the
present
moment
primitive
medicine
stands
midway
between
magic
and
religion
as
an
attempt
to
safeguard
health
by
control
of
supernatural
processes
and
the
warding
off
of
evil
influences
by
appeal
to
the
gods
in
all
primitive
societies
priest
magician
and
medicine
man
were
one
and
the
same
and
medicine
remained
stationary
until
it
could
divorce
itself
completely
from
religion
primitive
medicine
then
springs
from
folklore
legends
credulity
and
superstitions
the
same
forces
that
give
rise
to
all
forms
of
religious
beliefs
huxley
has
stated
science
commits
suicide
when
it
adopts
a
creed
and
from
the
earliest
of
times
those
men
who
had
a
scientific
trend
of
mind
realized
this
however
vaguely
and
have
attempted
to
divorce
science
from
religion
the
science
of
medicine
has
been
divorced
from
superstition
but
its
twin
brother
religion
lies
as
firmly
bogged
in
the
mire
of
superstition
today
as
it
did
in
the
days
of
the
incantations
of
the
first
theologist
the
shaman
and
it
is
due
to
this
close
association
of
religion
and
medicine
that
ideas
of
the
greatest
scientific
moment
have
been
throttled
at
birth
or
veered
into
a
blind
alley
through
some
current
theological
lunacy
medicine
has
advanced
through
its
disassociation
with
supernaturalism
while
religion
still
remains
the
last
refuge
of
human
savagery
and
so
it
had
been
that
throughout
those
long
sterile
and
barbarous
ages
primitive
man
ascribed
all
diseases
either
to
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
an
evil
being
with
the
rise
of
the
greek
philosophers
the
human
mind
for
the
first
time
began
to
throw
off
the
fogs
of
superstition
in
greece
years
before
christ
hippocrates
developed
scientific
thought
and
laid
the
foundations
of
medical
science
upon
observation
experience
and
reason
under
his
guidance
medicine
for
the
first
time
was
separated
from
religion
he
relieved
the
gods
of
the
responsibility
for
disease
and
placed
it
squarely
upon
the
shoulders
of
man
his
findings
were
passed
on
to
the
school
of
alexandria
and
there
medical
science
was
further
developed
at
this
stage
of
history
all
advances
stopped
and
for
the
following
reason
with
the
coming
of
christianity
this
science
as
well
as
all
others
was
stultified
a
retrogression
took
place
to
the
ideation
of
the
most
primitive
of
men
namely
the
conception
of
physical
disease
as
the
result
of
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
satan
or
by
a
combination
of
both
the
old
testament
attributes
such
diseases
as
the
leprosy
of
miriam
and
uzziah
the
boils
of
job
the
dysentery
of
jehoram
the
withered
hand
of
jeroboam
the
fatal
illness
of
asa
and
many
other
ills
to
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
satan
the
new
testament
furnishes
such
examples
as
the
woman
bound
by
satan
the
rebuke
of
the
fever
the
casting
out
of
the
devil
which
was
dumb
the
healing
of
persons
whom
the
devil
oftimes
casteth
into
the
fire
and
various
other
episodes
christian
theology
then
evolved
theories
of
miraculous
methods
of
cure
based
upon
modes
of
appeasing
the
divine
anger
or
of
thwarting
satanic
malice
the
curing
of
disease
by
the
casting
out
of
devils
by
prayers
were
the
means
of
relief
from
sickness
recognized
and
commanded
by
the
bible
thus
christianity

modern

has
no
conception
of
the

of
infections
and

that
swept
over

to

years
ago

thus
houses
were
filled
with

bodies
and
the
streets
with
funerals
alike
slaves
and
plebeians
were
suddenly
taken
off
amidst
lamentations
of
their
wives
and
children
who
while
they
mourned
the
dead
were
themselves
seized
with
the
disease
and
perishing
were
burned
on
the
same
funeral

in
an
epidemic
swept
rome
causing
deaths
daily
during
the
ages
until
the
present
century
wave
after
wave
of
pestilence
swept
over
europe
the
plague
in
took
no
less
than
million
lives
it
was
estimated
that
per
cent
of
the
population
of

the
horrors
of
such
visitations
are
beyond
description
and
can
scarcely
be
imagined
for
a
time
attempts
were
made
to
collect
and
bury
the
dead
wagons
would
pass
through
the
streets
at
night
collecting
the
victims
the
drivers
benumbed
with
drink
frequently
failed
to
ascertain
whether
death
had
occurred
living
patients
desperately
ill
were
piled
into
the
wagons
with
corpses
beneath
about
and
on
them
these
gruesome
loads
were
dumped
into
huge
pits
hastily
dug
for
the
purpose
in
some
instances
living
victims
crawled
out
of
these
pits
and
survived
to
tell
the
tale
as
the
epidemics
progressed
attempts
to
dispose
of
the
dead
were
abandoned
putrefying
bodies
were
everywhere
whole
cities
were
left
desolate
the
few
survivors
having
fled
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
such
epidemics
swept
over
europe
when
it
was
taught
that
these
were
the
vengeance
of
god
how
could
it
be
discovered
that
the
real
causes
were
the
crowded
conditions
and
bad
sanitation
of
the
cities
the
squalor
the
misrule
and
gross
immorality
occasioned
by
the
holy
wars
when
hordes
of
plagued
the
countryside
the
devout
continued
to
live
in
their
squalor
to
trust
in
the
lord
and
to
die
by
the
millions
in
all
pestilences
down
to
the
present
time
the
church
authorities
instead
of
aiding
and
devising
sanitary
measures
have
preached
the
necessity
of
immediate
atonement
for
offenses
against
the
almighty
the
chief
cause
of
the
immense
sacrifice
of
lives
in
these
plagues
was
of
course
the
lack
of
hygienic
precautions
but
how
could
this
be
discovered
when
for
ages
living
in
filth
was
regarded
by
great
numbers
of
holy
men
as
an
evidence
of
sanctity

mary

simeon
stylites
was

the
least
that
can
be
said
is
that
he
lived
in
ordure
and
stench
intolerable
to
his
visitors
for
century
after
century
the
idea
prevailed
that
filthiness
was
akin
to
holiness
another
stumblingblock
hindering
the
beginnings
of
modern
medicine
and
surgery
was
the
theory
regarding
the
unlawfulness
of
meddling
with
the
bodies
of
the
dead
the
dissection
of
the
human
body
was
prohibited
since
the
injury
to
the
body
would
prevent
its
resurrection
on
the
last
day
andreas
vesalius
was
the
pioneer
in
the
movement
for
increased
knowledge
of
anatomy
and
in
when
his
work
appeared
he
was
condemned
to
death
by
the
inquisition
as
a
magician
he
escaped
this
fate
by
undertaking
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
only
to
be
shipwrecked
on
the
island
of
zante
when
he
attempted
to
return
and
there
died
in
misery
and
destitution
in
the
year
cholera
after
having
committed
serious
ravages
in
many
parts
of
europe
visited
scotland
it
was
evident
to
most
thinking
people
that
due
to
the
extreme
poverty
and
squalor
of
most
of
the
scottish
towns
at
that
time
a
great
number
of
people
would
necessarily
succumb
to
this
disease
unless
stringent
sanitary
measures
were
instituted
immediately
instead
the
scotch
clergy
proposed
to
combat
this
scourge
with
prayer
and
fasting
which
would
have
lowered
the
resistance
to
this
disease
by
producing
physical
exhaustion
and
mental
depression
they
proposed
the
ordering
of
a
national
fast
day
in
which
the
people
were
to
sit
the
whole
day
without
nourishment
in
their
churches
and
retire
to
their
beds
at
night
weeping
and
starved
then
it
was
hoped
that
the
deity
would
be
propitiated
and
the
plague
stayed
to
give
greater
effect
to
this
fast
day
they
called
upon
england
to
help
them
and
the
presbytery
of
edinburgh
dispatched
a
letter
to
the
english
minister
requesting
information
as
to
whether
the
queen
would
appoint
a
national
fast
day
the
english
minister
to
his
credit
advised
the
presbytery
of
edinburgh
that
it
was
better
to
cleanse
than
to
fast
and
cleanse
they
must
swiftly
or
else
in
spite
of
all
prayers
and
fastings
of
a
united
but
inactive
nation
the
cholera
would
devastate
them
there
are
today
in
this
twentieth
century
two
pestilences
which
could
be
wiped
from
the
face
of
the
earth
there
are
two
pestilences
which
thus
unfortunately
involve
moral
conceptions
they
are
the
plagues
of
syphilis
and
gonorrhea
against
them
medicine
has
developed
methods
of
control
they
could
be
eradicated
but
as
yet
civilization
has
not
advanced
entirely
beyond
the
ancient
idea
that
disease
is
imposed
by
god
as
a
measure
of
vengeance
for
our
sins
it
still
rejects
protection
when
without
it
these
plagues
will
continue
to
exact
death
and
suffering
on
a
scale
which
probably
exceeds
that
of
any
one
of
the
medieval
plagues
those
who
today
look
upon
syphilis
and
gonorrhea
as
punishment
for
sin
have
not
progressed
beyond
the
ideas
of
medieval
europe
ignorance
and
bigotry
are
the
twin
allies
of
the
plagues
of
syphilis
and
gonorrhea
medicine
and
civilization
advance
and
regress
together
the
conditions
essential
to
advance
are
intellectual
courage
and
a
true
love
for
humanity
it
is
as
true
today
as
always
in
the
past
that
further
advances
or
even
the
holding
of
what
has
already
been
won
depend
upon
the
extent
to
which
intellectual
courage
and
humanity
prevail
against
bigotry
and
obscurantism
devils
doctors
and
drugs
as
a
result
of
the
lack
of
control
of
these
plagues
there
are
in
the
world
at
the
present
moment
thousands
of
children
suffering
from
congenital
syphilis
who
would
never
have
been
born
but
for
the
desire
of
christians
to
see
sinners
punished
with
regard
to
the
spread
of
sex
knowledge
the
clergy
attitude
is
dangerous
to
human
welfare
the
artificial
ignorance
of
sex
subjects
which
orthodox
christians
attempt
to
enforce
upon
the
young
is
extremely
dangerous
to
mental
and
physical
health
the
young
are
much
less
likely
to
act
wisely
when
they
are
ignorant
than
when
they
are
instructed
these
two
venereal
diseases
are
no
more
controlled
under
the
moral
standards
of
today
than
they
were
two
centuries
ago
and
yet
medical
science
offers
for
these
diseases
what
it
can
offer
for
few
others
both
a
prevention
and
a
cure
and
it
is
due
to
the
ignorance
and
the
bigotry
of
the
theists
that
the
spread
of
sex
knowledge
is
hampered
so
that
a
sane
conception
of
sex
and
the
prevention
of
venereal
disease
does
not
eradicate
these
diseases
the
theists
have
therefore
without
sense
or
justice
founded
their
morality
on
disease
neglecting
the
fact
that
all
disease
is
immoral
in
the
widest
sense
since
it
is
detrimental
to
the
happiness
of
man
and
that
no
one
disease
is
more
so
than
another
the
morality
of
the
body
is
health
not
disease
so
much
for
the
actual
facts
and
reality
in
passing
to
the
theoretical
we
again
see
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
religion
is
the
last
resort
of
human
savagery
to
postulate
that
a
supreme
being
is
omnipotent
omniscient
and
and
then
to
assume
that
he
inflicts
disease
on
his
children
as
punishment
for
sin
is
a
sadistic
mental
aberration
in
his
omniscience
he
full
well
knows
beforehand
what
each
of
his
children
will
do
he
foreordains
their
sins
and
then
punishes
his
children
for
sins
that
he
wills
them
to
commit
it
is
just
as
if
a
syphilitic
father
should
punish
his
syphilitic
child
because
the
child
has
that
congenital
disease
for
which
the
father
is
responsible
if
the
theist
insists
that
his
deity
is
all
that
he
claims
him
to
be
then
it
is
only
logical
that
instead
of
man
asking
his
god
for
forgiveness
what
actually
should
be
is
that
god
should
ask
the
forgiveness
of
man
for
his
bungling
and
error
christianity
has
attempted
from
its
inception
to
eradicate
the
sexual
instinct
and
in
so
doing
has
antagonized
an
instinct
that
is
as
fundamental
as
that
of
all
it
has
accomplished
is
a
distortion
the
church
by
claiming
that
it
alone
was
privileged
to
regulate
sexual
desires
has
done
one
of
two
things
to
each
of
its
adherents
it
has
either
made
him
a
hypocrite
or
driven
him
insane
much
of
the
insanity
in
this
country
could
be
overcome
were
religion
and
sex
permanently
divorced
and
an
immediate
amount
of
inestimable
good
could
be
accomplished
when
one
considers
that
fifteen
per
cent
of
all
mental
disease
is
caused
by
syphilis
physical
disease
having
been
considered
as
a
malicious
trick
of
satan
it
was
but
natural
that
the
disease
of
the
mind
was
also
attributed
to
satanic
intervention
the
conception
that
insanity
was
a
brain
disease
and
that
gentleness
and
kindness
were
necessary
for
its
treatment
was
throttled
by
christian
theology
for
fifteen
centuries
instead
the
ecclesiastic
burdened
humanity
with
a
belief
that
madness
was
largely
possession
by
the
devil
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
were
inflicted
with
tortures
both
physical
and
mental
it
was
not
until
that
the
great
french
physician
penel
and
william
tuke
in
england
placed
the
treatment
of
mental
disease
on
a
rational
and
scientific
basis
and
this
in
spite
of
such
ecclesiastical
attacks
as
were
seen
in
the
of
that
period
these
two
men
penel
and
tuke
were
the
first
acknowledged
victors
in
a
struggle
of
science
for
humanity
which
lasted
nearly
two
thousand
years
the
clergy
resisted
jenner
when
he
introduced
vaccination
and
yet
the
application
of
this
measure
of
defense
against
disease
has
probably
saved
more
lives
than
the
total
of
all
the
lives
lost
in
all
wars
the
clergy
maintained
that
smallpox
is
a
visitation
from
god
and
originates
in
man
but
cowpox
is
produced
by
presumptious
impious
men
the
former
heaven
ordained
the
latter
is
perhaps
a
daring
and
profane
violation
of
our
holy
order
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
jesuit
missionaries
in
south
america
learned
from
the
natives
the
value
of
the
peruvian
bark
in
the
treatment
of
ague
in
quinine
derived
from
this
bark
was
introduced
into
europe
as
a
cure
for
malaria
it
was
stigmatized
as
an
invention
of
the
devil
the
ecclesiastical
opposition
to
this
drug
was
so
strong
that
it
was
not
introduced
into
england
until
the
medieval
christians
saw
in
childbirth
the
result
of
a
carnal
sin
to
be
expiated
in
pain
as
defined
in
genesis
accordingly
the
treatment
given
the
woman
was
vastly
worse
than
the
mere
neglect
among
the
primitive
peoples
her
sufferings
were
augmented
by
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
a
primitive
woman
and
had
become
more
difficult
in
these
ages
of
faith
which
could
be
better
called
the
ages
of
filth
nothing
was
done
to
overcome
the
enormous
mortality
of
the
mother
and
child
at
birth
attempts
however
were
made
to
form
baptismal
tubes
by
which
the
child
when
it
was
locked
by
some
ill
chance
in
its
mother
womb
could
be
baptized
and
its
soul
saved
before
the
mother
and
child
were
left
to
die
together
but
nothing
was
done
to
save
their
lives
no
greater
crimes
were
ever
committed
in
the
name
of
civilization
religious
faith
and
smug
ignorance
than
the
sacrifice
of
the
lives
of
countless
mothers
and
children
in
the
first
fifteen
centuries
after
christ
among
civilized
mankind
approaching
our
own
time
we
have
the
example
of
james
simpson
professor
of
obstetrics
at
the
university
of
glasgow
about
first
administering
an
anesthetic
to
alleviate
the
pain
of
childbirth
he
was
bitterly
opposed
by
the
clergy
on
the
ground
that
it
was
impious
to
attempt
to
escape
from
the
curse
pronounced
against
all
women
in
genesis
it
was
simpson
who
in
defending
this
humanitarian
practice
asserted
that
opposition
particularly
on
theological
grounds
had
been
presented
against
every
humane
innovation
in
the
past
when
paul
ehrlich
in
announced
his
discovery
of
salvarsan
for
the
treatment
of
syphilis
the
clergy
again
were
that
man
should
interfere
with
a
visitation
of
the
lord
the
resistance
to
the
spread
of
information
concerning
contraception
commonly
known
as
birth
control
is
an
example
of
the
church
dominance
of
government
today
and
yet
this
information
is
as
vital
to
the
welfare
of
humanity
as
is
the
control
of
cancer
in
our
newspapers
carried
conspicuous
headlines
episcopal
church
joins
catholic
to
gag
birth
control
four
years
later
bishops
of
the
episcopal
church
met
in
london
and
by
a
majority
of
to
voted
in
favor
of
contraception
when
there
is
morally
sound
reason
for
avoiding
complete
abstinence
the
bishops
had
by
this
time
become
well
aware
of
the
insistence
of
secular
opinion
towards
this
movement
and
having
done
their
best
to
prevent
this
progressive
movement
for
the
past
one
hundred
years
they
finally
accepted
defeat
proving
once
again
that
religion
has
never
accepted
anything
that
science
has
shown
to
be
a
fact
or
of
benefit
to
humanity
until
it
was
compelled
to
do
so
to
save
its
face
the
infallible
church
however
still
persists
in
its
opposition
and
in
the
encyclical
of
pope
pius
xi
published
in
january
it
is
said
the
conjugal
act
is
destined
primarily
by
nature
for
the
begetting
of
children
those
who
in
exercising
it
deliberately
frustrate
its
natural
power
and
purpose
are
against
nature
and
commit
a
deed
which
is
shameful
and
intrinsically
vicious
so
speaks
the
infallible
pope
but
the
great
majority
of
physicians
hold
that
there
are
few
things
more
perilous
to
mental
health
intellectual
efficiency
moral
equanimity
and
physical
than
prolonged
denial
of
the
sex
urge
for
the
average
normal
human
being
every
physician
can
furnish
numerous
case
histories
to
substantiate
the
statement
that
continual
sexual
abstinence
is
prejudicial
to
the
health
and
happiness
of
the
man
and
woman
and
is
the
causation
of
hundreds
of
semiderelicts
and
psychoneurotics
furthermore
the
rising
tide
of
insanity
in
this
country
would
be
stemmed
were
religion
and
sex
permanently
divorced
today
the
modern
clergy
still
endeavor
to
explain
natural
phenomena
by
supernatural
theories
and
while
they
do
not
assign
preternatural
powers
to
witches
and
demons
they
yet
persist
in
attempting
to
pervert
facts
of
science
and
delude
themselves
with
faith
in
some
supernatural
force
the
clergy
state
that
the
physician
cures
disease
through
the
mediation
of
god
the
physician
merely
playing
the
part
of
the
agent
of
god
through
whom
the
real
cure
is
effected
is
anything
more
ridiculous
and
at
the
same
time
more
contradictory
than
to
suppose
that
an
god
should
have
to
appoint
an
intermediary
to
perform
his
work
and
if
it
is
only
by
god
will
and
aid
that
a
cure
takes
place
then
it
follows
that
god
must
be
willing
for
the
individual
to
be
cured
why
in
the
name
of
reason
did
he
not
prevent
the
initial
step
the
contracting
of
the
disease
what
a
mass
of
suffering
of
mental
anguish
might
thus
have
been
spared
us
thus
this
omnipotent
being
either
did
not
desire
to
spare
us
this
misery
and
suffering
in
which
case
he
must
surely
be
a
monster
incarnate
or
on
the
other
hand
he
is
powerless
to
halt
it
and
thus
can
not
be
omnipotent
while
the
clergy
maintain
that
a
cure
is
only
effected
by
god
will
the
physician
knows
otherwise
the
physician
accomplishes
his
cures
alone
and
definitely
cures
and
saves
the
lives
of
human
beings
by
his
own
skill
intelligence
and
application
of
methods
which
have
been
developed
by
the
exercise
of
secular
knowledge
not
theological
nonsense
when
man
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
contract
an
infection
of
the
appendix
and
that
inflammation
succeeds
to
so
that
this
diseased
and
part
of
the
human
anatomy
is
on
the
point
of
rupturing
and
causing
a
fatal
peritonitis
it
is
not
by
god
will
and
intervention
that
a
cure
is
effected
but
by
the
intervention
of
the
surgeon
who
removes
the
diseased
part
if
man
depended
upon
god
will
to
save
him
as
he
did
in
the
past
the
appendix
would
rupture
peritonitis
would
set
in
and
despite
prayers
and
sacrificial
offerings
the
deity
would
exact
his
life
when
an
innocent
infant
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
life
develops
an
intussusception
an
infolding
of
the
bowel
which
causes
an
acute
obstruction
the
prayers
and
supplication
of
the
parents
avail
not
a
particle
if
the
surgeon
did
not
save
the
infant
life
by
operating
and
removing
the
obstruction
the
benevolent
being
would
allow
the
child
to
die
the
adult
who
develops
a
hernia
which
is
due
to
a
defect
in
the
construction
of
the
human
body
which
is
assigned
to
an
omniscient
being
who
still
persists
in
forming
bodies
that
are
defective
and
this
hernia
becomes
strangulated
twisted
the
deity
sits
calmly
by
in
omnipotent
inaction
while
the
prompt
interference
of
the
surgeon
saves
the
individual
life
when
the
surgeon
observes
a
superficial
cancerous
growth
or
an
internal
growth
which
can
be
removed
in
its
entirety
does
he
trust
to
the
lord
to
halt
this
pernicious
development
no
the
surgeon
does
not
consult
god
but
resorts
to
his
own
knowledge
and
skill
to
save
a
human
life
the
diphtheritic
child
who
is
strangling
to
death
with
a
diphtheritic
membrane
in
its
throat
is
not
permitted
by
the
physician
to
be
left
to
the
benevolent
being
will
nor
to
the
prayers
of
the
parents
the
physician
prayer
is
the
diphtheria
antitoxin
which
in
his
hands
is
the
device
when
the
physician
administers
quinine
for
malaria
or
salvarsan
for
syphilis
he
effects
cures
for
these
diseases
by
using
agents
to
which
the
clergy
strenuously
objected
when
they
were
first
introduced
and
when
the
ecclesiastic
attributes
to
the
deity
whatever
laws
man
has
been
able
to
evolve
out
of
his
own
experience
and
wisdom
he
establishes
fallaciously
the
corollary
that
if
god
is
responsible
for
the
cures
he
is
also
responsible
for
the
then
what
of
the
countless
number
that
died
of
disease
before
man
evolved
those
cures
and
what
of
the
wholesale
murder
of
his
children
in
the
past
ages
do
certain
diseases
still
baffle
the
physician
surely
it
is
less
often
than
the
pestilences
of
old
which
baffled
sacrifice
and
prayer
the
cruelest
laws
ever
devised
by
man
have
more
equity
and
benevolence
in
them
than
the
appalling
and
irrational
jurisprudence
of
the
deity
do
certain
diseases
as
yet
remain
to
plague
man
then
it
is
only
because
religion
has
for
the
past
years
been
the
greatest
obstacle
in
the
development
of
cures
for
these
diseases
every
single
individual
in
the
past
years
who
has
succumbed
to
a
disease
for
which
medical
science
has
no
cure
has
died
directly
at
the
hands
of
religion
the
obstruction
which
religion
has
placed
on
the
development
of
medical
science
has
laid
at
its
feet
the
responsibility
for
the
deaths
of
countless
millions
throughout
the
ages
the
religionist
replies
that
man
mind
can
not
fathom
the
will
of
god
which
is
an
irrational
statement
for
it
is
a
well
established
fact
and
indeed
a
criterion
of
insanity
that
when
the
deranged
are
confronted
with
facts
which
are
conclusive
and
with
creations
of
the
imagination
they
can
not
differentiate
fact
from
fancy
and
maintain
instead
that
fancy
is
the
real
fact
the
religionists
are
guilty
of
the
same
breach
of
reason
they
suffer
with
what
may
be
termed
dementia
religiosa
the
remarkable
feature
of
the
latter
disease
is
its
wide
prevalence
haggard
in
his
book
devils
drugs
and
doctors
declares
the
early
and
medieval
christians
accepted
the
doctrine
of
the
power
of
demons
in
the
lives
of
men
they
saw
this
power
particularly
in
the
demoniac
production
of
diseases
they
believed
in
miracles
and
especially
in
the
miraculous
healing
of
diseases
the
demonological
belief
of
the
christians
was
inherited
from
the
doctrine
of
the
jews
who
were
believers
in
demons
and
the
by
the
devil
jesus
himself
cured
by
casting
out
of
devils
following
his
example
christians
everywhere
became
exorcists
jewish
demonology
was
continued
among
christian
converts
and
the
belief
in
supernatural
interpositions
in
human
affairs
was
widely
accepted
has
retarded
the
growth
of
scientific
medicine
during
the
past
years
so
much
as
the
iron
grip
of
theology
in
maintaining
practices
based
on
belief
in
this
supernatural
origin
of
the
fabled
curing
of
disease
by
casting
out
devils
and
the
new
testament
recordings
of
conviction
that
disease
was
caused
by
evil
spirits
have
had
an
inestimable
detrimental
result
on
the
development
of
medical
science
the
fact
that
jesus
believed
in
the
demoniacal
production
of
diseases
and
cured
them
by
exorcism
was
deemed
so
important
by
the
author
of
the
gospel
according
to
mark
that
he
has
actually
recorded
the
aramaic
words
jesus
was
reported
to
have
used
in
addressing
his
patients
in
mark
jesus
is
reported
to
have
given
the
command
talitha
cumi
to
a
little
jewish
girl
whom
her
parents
believed
dead
in
mark
jesus
is
reported
as
uttering
the
magical
word
ephphatha
as
he
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
he
spit
and
touched
his
tongue
in
behalf
of
one
that
was
deaf
and
had
an
impediment
in
his
speech
an
excellent
and
timely
illustration
of
what
occurs
when
secular
knowledge
has
not
yet
replaced
ecclesiastical
ignorance
and
bigotry
particularly
in
the
field
of

was

it
is
especially
true
that
there
is

much
at

yet
to
be
done
but
all
this
has
been
achieved
so
recently
what
might
not
have
been
won
had
not
the
minds
of
men
been
polluted
from
infancy
warped
by
the
first
professional
holy
men
the
religionists
the
priests
had
the
idea
of
a
supernatural
force
been
allowed
to
die
in
the
dark
ages
as
it
surely
would
have
as
man
mind
expanded
and
developed
humanity
would
today
find
itself
more
advanced
on
the
road
to
progress
but
as
it
was
the
myth
of
religion
was
foisted
on
the
superstitious
brain
and
man
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
and
lived
in
such
a
manner
as
to
please
this
hypothetical
supernatural
being
the
inevitable
result
was
the
abject
misery
both
material
and
spiritual
of
europe
during
the
period
when
the
church
was
in
absolute
control
if
this
myth
and
mystification
had
died
with
the
dead
ages
as
it
should
have
done
what
a
fitter
place
to
live
in
this
world
would
be
today
consider
the
needless
misery
and
the
agony
of
those
who
died
of
the
various
plagues
and
think
of
the
advanced
stage
of
medicine
of
alexandria
three
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
where
the
physicians
were
welcomed
to
the
famous
library
by
the
emperors
the
state
gave
them
their
livelihood
and
their
duties
were
to
advance
medicine
by
study
and
research
anatomy
was
studied
and
dissection
was
allowed
with
the
coming
of
christianity
the
remnants
of
this
library
were
destroyed
and
with
them
went
all
progress
in
that
field
if
such
had
been
the
enlightened
state
in
egypt
three
hundred
years
before
christianity
appeared
then
why
had
not
science
made
the
same
progress
then
as
it
does
now
because
to
the
knowledge
stored
in
the
library
at
alexandria
had
not
been
added
a
progression
of
learning
a
continued
process
of
research
if
this
had
not
been
halted
by
christianity
how
much
vaster
would
our
achievements
be
today
it
was
not
necessary
for
all
of
those
millions
to
have
been
the
victims
of
plagues
of
inquisitions
of
witchcraft
burnings
of
religious
persecutions
and
wars
the
sorrow
and
pain
brought
to
untold
numbers
throughout
the
centuries
could
have
been
prevented
and
would
have
been
if
man
had
been
interested
in
the
welfare
of
his
fellowmen
instead
of
the
glorification
of
an
almighty
being
future
generations
may
well
declare
religion
to
have
been
the
curse
of
humanity
the
church
had
cursed
the
human
intellect
by
cursing
the
doubts
which
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
its
exercise
she
had
cursed
even
the
moral
faculty
by
asserting
the
guilt
of
honest
error
medicine
which
has
for
its
sole
objects
the
alleviation
of
sufferings
to
cure
them
when
possible
to
relieve
more
often
the
pains
and
ills
which
make
this
life
a
living
hell
what
might
it
not
have
accomplished
ages
ago
had
religion
not
interfered
with
its
progress
whatever
cures
are
known
and
preventions
that
are
practiced
now
could
have
been
common
knowledge
centuries
ago
and
what
of
the
multitudes
that
perished
who
might
have
been
saved
and
what
of
the
misery
which
might
have
been
prevented
had
not
this
curse
fallen
upon
man
since
there
have
been
only
five
deaths
from
yellow
fever
in
the
united
states
outbreaks
of
cholera
and

these

which
medical

in

indeed
if

there

he
could
not

more
than
by

the

as

we
would
not
be

behind
in
all
branches

learning
but
there
has
never
been
an
advance
in
science
of
widespread
importance
which
in
some
manner
endangered
some
mouldy
religious
concept
that
the

has
not
bitterly
opposed
an

in

has
proven
of
inestimable
good
for
all
mankind
a

at
the

will
reveal
scores
of
such
instances
the
opposition
to
medicine
as
previously
noted
is
only
one
of
many
examples
which
might
have
been
chosen
in
proportion
as
the

education
tightened
medicine
declined
and

religion
and
astronomy
in
the
early
church
astronomy
like
other
branches
of
science
was
looked
upon
as
futile
since
the
new
testament
taught
that
the
earth
was
soon
to
be
destroyed
and
new
heavens
created
the
heavenly
bodies
were
looked
upon
by
the
theologians
as
either
living
beings
possessing
souls
or
as
the
habitation
of
the
angels
however
as
time
passed
the
geocentric
doctrine
the
doctrine
that
the
earth
is
the
center
of
the
universe
and
that
the
sun
and
planets
revolve
about
it
was
the
theory
that
held
the
highest
respect
copernicus
in
was
first
to
bring
clearly
before
the
world
the
then
astounding
theory
that
the
earth
and
planets
revolve
about
the
sun
but
not
until
he
was
on
his
deathbed
did
he
dare
to
publish
it
for
he
well
knew
the
opposition
with
which
it
would
be
met
even
then
he
published
it
with
an
apologetic
lie
by
a
friend
osiander
that
copernicus
had
propounded
the
doctrine
of
the
earth
movement
not
as
a
fact
but
as
a
hypothesis
thus
was
the
greatest
and
most
ennobling
perhaps
of
scientific
truths
a
truth
not
less
ennobling
to
religion
than
to
science
forced
in
coming
before
the
world
to
sneak
and
crawl
history
of
warfare
of
science
with
theology
during
the
next
seventy
years
the
matter
slumbered
until
galileo
upheld
the
copernican
doctrine
as
the
truth
and
proved
it
to
be
the
truth
by
his
telescope
immediately
the
church
condemned
the
statements
of
copernicus
and
forbade
galileo
to
teach
or
discuss
them
all
books
which
affirmed
the
motion
of
the
earth
were
forbidden
and
to

the
climax
of
this

occurred

the
ancient
greeks
especially
the
pythagoreans
plato
and

had
evolved
theories
of
the

sphericity
which
while
vague
were
basic
for
subsequent
accurate
ideas
that
developed
later
when
christianity
sprang
into
existence
eusebius
john
chrysostom
and
cosmos
evolved
a
complete
description
of
the
earth
they
considered
the
earth
as
a
parallelogram
flat
and
surrounded
by
four
seas
as
a
kind
of
house
with
heaven
as
its
upper
story
and
the
earth
as
its
ground
floor
to
the
north
of
the

was
a

at

the

was
pushed
into

and
pulled
out

of
the

luther
melanchthon
calvin

held
to
the
opinion
that
a

firmament

floor
separated
the

from
the
earth
that
above
it
were
the
waters
and
angels
and
below
it
the
earth
and
man
during
the
time
that
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
was
still
undecided
another
question
arose
that
was
considered
of
far
greater
importance
namely
the
conception
of
the
antipodes
and
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
human
beings
existed
on
the
earth
opposite
side
it
was
lactantius
who
asked
is
there
any
one
so
senseless
as
to
believe
that
there
are
men
whose
footsteps
are
higher
than
their
heads
that
the

grow
downward
that

in

a

dared
to
assert
that

living
in

he
was
strongly
attacked
by

who
appealed
to

zachary
for

decision
the
pope
as
the
infallible
teacher
of

made
the
following
response
he
declared
it
perverse
iniquitous
and
against
soul
and
again
another
infallible
statement
by
the
infallible
pope
zachary
became
a
doctrine
of
the
church
in
italy
in
peter
of
abano
famous
as

promulgated
the

view
to
that
of

the

was
created
by
the
trinity
on
the
of
october
at
nine
in
the
morning
when
the
egyptologists
assyriologists
archeologists
and
anthropologists
showed
that
man
had
reached
a
far
advanced
stage
of
civilization
long
before
the
years
given
as
the
age
of
the
earth
their
efforts
were
ridiculed
by
the
clergy
and
these
scientists
were
forced
to
bring
their
findings
before
the
world
in
the
face
of
the
well
known
methods
of
ecclesiastical
opposition
at
a
very
early
period
in
the
evolution
of
civilization
men
began
to
ask
questions
regarding
language
and
the
answers
to
these
questions
were
naturally
embodied
in
the
myths
legends
and
chronicles
of
their
sacred
books
language
was
considered
and
complete
the
diversity
of
language
was
firmly
held
to
be
explained
by
the
story
of
the
tower
of
babel
and
since
the
writers
of
the
bible
were
merely
pens
in
the
hand
of
god
the
conclusion
was
reached
that
not
only
the
sense
but
the
words
letters
and
even
the
punctuation
proceeded
from
the
holy
spirit
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
ecclesiastical
contention
that
the
hebrew
punctuation
was
divinely
inspired
seemed
to
be
generally
disproven
the
great
orthodox
body
of
religiosa
dementia
fell
back
upon
the
remainder
of
the
theory
that
the
hebrew
language
was
the
first
of
all
languages
which
was
spoken
by
the
almighty
given
by
him
to
adam
transmitted
through
noah
to
the
world
after
the
deluge
and
that
the
confusion
of
tongues
was
the
origin
of
all
other
tongues
it
has
only
been
in
comparatively
recent
time
and
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
clergy
that
language
has
been
accepted
as
the
result
of
evolutionary
processes
in
obedience
to
laws
more
or
less
clearly
ascertained
babel
thus
takes
its
place
quietly
among
the
other
myths
of
the
bible
in
a
purely
civil
matter
the
infallible
church
from
its
inception
had
displayed
a
marked
hostility
to
loans
at
interest
from
the
earliest
period
the
whole
weight
of
the
church
was
brought
to
bear
against
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
pope
leo
the
great
solemnly
adjudged
it
a
sin
worthy

in
the
thirteenth

pope
gregory

an
especially
severe
blow
at
commerce
by
his
declaration
that
even
to

the

was
damnable
usury
the
whole

of

was
greatly
hindered
by
this
policy

darwinism
which
at
first
was
declared
by
the
clergy
to
be
brutal
degrading
atheistic
and
is
now
included
as
part
of
the
bible
teaching
in
a
similar

the
copernican
theory
the
theory
of
gravitation
the
nebular
hypothesis
the
theory
of
uniformity
in
geology
and
every
scientific
advance
has
been
opposed
on
the
same
grounds
that
is
that
these
are
against
the
teachings
of
the
christian
church
and
how
many
galileos
brunos
and
darwins
and
other
benefactors
to
the
human
race
have
died
mute
because
of
this
opposition
and
fear
of

the

eminent

who
was
so
pleased
with
it
that
he
sent
the
author
a

in
which
he
stated
that
it
refutes
so
well
the
aberrations
of
darwinism
a
system
which
is
repugnant
at
once
to
history
to
the
traditions
of
all
peoples
to

to

facts
and
even
to

the

with
which
this

at
this
late
date
was
met
with
by
the
comments
of
the

in
this
country
and

is
at

encouraging
but
it
is
an
excellent

of

exert
in

of

attention
to
the
following
take
the

the
more
we
learn
about
biological
history
the
clearer
it
becomes
that
the
process
has
been
from
the
human
point
of
view
incredibly
bungling
and
wasteful
there
have
been
futile
experiments
without
number
highly
successful
achievements
have
been
thrown
aside
one
type
of
life
after
another
has
arisen
and
has
pushed
up
a
blind
alley
to
extinction
if
there
is
a
god
whose
method
has
been
evolution
then
seemingly
his
slogan
was
fight
it
out
along
this
line
if
it
takes
a
but
unlike

he
has
always
surrendered
in
this
maelstrom
the
human
species
as
thomas
huxley
said
and
floundered
amid
the
general
stream
of
evolution
keeping
its
head
above
water
as
best
it
might
and
thinking
neither
of
whence
nor
whither
many
volumes
have
been
written
to
give
a
purposive
interpretation
of
the
rise
and
evolutionary
ramifications
of
living
forms
the
course
of
evolution
itself
is
their
refutation
when
the
churches
could
no
longer
ignore
the
rising
tide
of
secular
opinion
they
resorted
to
compromise
and
called
to
their
aid
a
certain
number
of
intellectually
dishonest
scientists
the
attempt
to
harmonize
christianity
and
evolution
can
only
be
accounted
for
in
terms
of
either
dishonesty
or
stupidity
and
that
is
true
of
the
whole
range
of
science
science
is
in
fact
atheistic
or
nothing
it
knows
nothing
of
god
it
does
not
bother
about
god
its
triumphs
are
achieved
by
leaving
god
out
of
account
what
has
heretofore
been
mentioned
is
but
a
mere
trifle
when
one
considers
the
vast
number
of
similar
incidents
in
which
religion
has
played
the
rôle
of
barrier
to
progress
these
examples
though
few
are
sufficient
to
impress
the
mind
of
any
intelligent
individual
with
the
conviction
in
spite
of
all
the
sophistry
and
casuistry
of
the
ecclesiastical
apologies
that
progress
in
this
world
has
taken
place
in
direct
proportion
to
the
degree
that
the
mind
of
man
has
liberated
itself
from
the
control
of
theology
and
the

of

chapter

religion

that
a

should
be
destroyed
than

the
worst
death
of
the

is
freedom
to

would
be
hard
to
calculate
the
perilous

treacherous

an

the

has
been

for
i
know
not
how
much
human
agony
menacing
indeed
to
human
happiness
was
such
a
claim
and
in
the
course
of
time
when
the
corporate
body
of
the
church
became
in
christendom
it
put
into
tyrannical
practice
what
had
been
but
a
theological
llewelyn
powys
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
chapter
to
trace
the
origin
of
witches
wizards
and
devils
the
widespread
belief
in
them
at
the
time
of
pagan
rome
and
the
manner
in
which
these
were
incorporated
into
christian
theology
with
the
rise
of
christianity
and
the
gain
of
political
power
by
its
adherents
the
perverted
pagan
idea
of
witchcraft
became
the
source
of
the
most
terrible
persecutions
in
the
bloody
history
of
religion
the
numerous
references
to
witches
and
devils
in
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
established
the
authority
for
the
organized
religious
mania
that
scourged
both
roman
catholic
and
protestant
europe
and
extended
its
tentacles
into
the
new
england
colonies
instigated
by
ecclesiastics
and
carried
into
effect
by
the
intellectual
serfs
their
adherents
hundreds
of
thousands
of
witches
were
tortured
and
burned
during
the
sway
of
the
witchcraft
delusion
with
the
bible
as
an
inspiration
the
clergy
inflamed
the
superstitious
minds
of
the
masses
of
that
time
with
the
conception
of
a
ceaseless
strife
between
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
kingdom
of
satan
for
possession
of
their
souls
and
their
bodies
we
of
the
present
age
may
readily
wonder
how
such
a
belief
could
have
had
so
firm
a
grasp
on
the
minds
of
our
ancestors
perhaps
we
will
be
tempted
to
attribute
it
to
the
ignorance
of
that
time
particularly
to
the
ignorance
of
the
untutored
masses
on
the
contrary
this
does
not
approximate
the
actual
situation
history
reveals
that
the
greatest
minds
of
that
age
men
eminent
in
law
letters
and
philosophy
not
only
defended
this
conception
strenuously
but
even
engaged
in
the
extermination
of
witches
that
men
of
such
superior
intellect
could
defend
such
a
barbaric
institution
which
today
is
revolting
to
our
senses
necessitates
the
conclusion
formulated
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
believed
that
it
was
possible
by
supernatural
means
to
inflict
evil
on
their
fellowmen
and
all
the
sects
of
philosophers
admitted
this
with
the
exception
of
the
epicureans
who
denied
the
existence
of
evil
spirits
the
magicians
in
greece
and
rome
were
at
times
punished
because
they
injured
men
and
not
because
they
offended
the
gods
during
the
latter
period
of
pagan
rome
some
of
the
emperors
passed
laws
against
the
magicians
if
it
was
proven
that
by
casting
the
horoscope
the
magicians
had
ascertained
what
was
according
to
their
belief
the
most
auspicious
time
to
start
a
rebellion
against
their
rule
the
emperors
however
notably
marcus
aurelius
and
julian
were
the
patrons
of
magicians
who
foretold
coming
events
to
them
the
public
methods
of
foretelling
the
future
such
as
the
oracle
of
the
gods
formed
part
of
their
religion
when
the
first
christians
came
into
rome
and
spread
christianity
throughout
the
empire
they
were
inspired
by
an
intense
religious
enthusiasm
they
thought
much
less
of
the
civil
than
of
the
religious
consequence
of
magic
and
sacrilege
seemed
much
more
terrible
in
their
eyes
than
anarchy
the
christians
found
in
rome
a
vast
polytheistic
religion
in
contrast
to
their
own
in
which
the
entire
world
was
divided
into
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
kingdom
of
satan
for
them
the
world
seemed
to
be
teeming
with
malignant
demons
who
had
in
all
ages
persecuted
and
deluded
mankind
according
to
these
christians
the
immediate
objects
of
the
devotions
of
the
pagan
world
were
subsidiary
spirits
of
finite
power
and
imperfect
morality
angels
or
as
they
were
then
called
demons
who
acted
the
part
of
mediators
and
who
by
permission
of
the
supreme
and
inaccessible
deity
regulated
the
religious
government
of
mankind
the
christians
had
adopted
this
conception
of
subsidiary
spirits
but
they
maintained
them
to
be
not
the
willing
agents
but
the
adversaries
of
the
deity
and
the
word
demon
which
among
the
pagans
signified
only
a
spirit
below
the
level
of
a
divinity
among
the
christians
signified
a
devil
this
notion
seems
to
have
existed
in
the
very
earliest
period
of
christianity
and
in
the
second
century
we
find
it
elaborated
with
the
most
minute
and
detailed
care
tertullian
who
wrote
in
that
century
assures
us
that
the
world
was
full
of
these
evil
spirits
whose
influence
might
be
descried
in
every
portion
of
the
pagan
creed
if
a
christian
in
any
respect
deviated
from
the
path
of
duty
a
visible
manifestation
of
the
devil
sometimes
appeared
to
terrify
him
the
terror
which
such
a
doctrine
must
have
spread
among
the
early
christians
may
be
easily
conceived
they
seemed
to
breathe
an
atmosphere
of
miracles
wherever
they
turned
they
were
surrounded
and
beleaguered
by
malicious
spirits
who
were
perpetually
manifesting
their
presence
by
supernatural
arts
watchful
fiends
stood
beside
every
altar
they
mingled
with
every
avocation
of
life
and
the
christians
were
the
special
objects
of
their
hatred
all
this
was
universally
believed
and
was
realized
with
an
intensity
which
in
this
secular
age
we
can
scarcely
conceive
the
bearing
of
this
view
upon
the
conception
of
magic
is
very
obvious
among
the
more
civilized
pagans
magic
was
mainly
a
civil
and
in
the
last
days
of
the
empire
a
political
crime
in
the
early
church
on
the
other
hand
it
was
esteemed
the
most
horrible
form
of
sacrilege
effected
by
the
direct
agency
of
evil
spirits
it
included
the
whole
system
of
paganism
explained
all
its
prodigies
and
gave
a
fearful
significance
to
all
its
legends
when
the
church
obtained
the
direction
of
the
civil
power
she
soon
modified
or
abandoned
the
tolerant
maxims
she
had
formerly
inculcated
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
restrictive
laws
were
enacted
both
against
jews
and
heretics
constantine
after
his
conversion
to
christianity
enacted
laws
against
the
magicians
these
were
made
more
rigid
under
constantius
his
son
but
suspended
under
julian
these
persecutions
were
renewed
by
valentinian
spasmodically
carried
on
to
a
slight
extent
and
then
lapsed
during
the
period
that
elapsed
between
the
sixth
and
thirteenth
centuries
the
executions
for
sorcery
were
comparatively
rare
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
then
that
magic
as
existing
in
pagan
rome
was
part
of
the
religious
conceptions
of
the
romans
the
oracle
as
well
as
the
various
demons
which
to
them
signified
what
the
word
angel
signifies
to
us
now
formed
an
elaborate
system
of
mythology
and
idolatry
the
early
christians
coming
into
contact
with
these
conceptions
at
first
found
an
insurmountable
difficulty
in
spreading
their
beliefs
among
the
rural
inhabitants
of
the
roman
empire
polytheism
was
dominant
while
their
monotheism
was
as
yet
a
persecuted
belief
the
road
of
least
resistance
was
compromise
and
so
this
vast
system
of
polytheism
was
perverted
while
seemingly
accepted
into
their
beliefs
by
making
these
angels
demons
as
we
now
understand
the
word
since
the
early
christians
were
dominated
by
a
belief
in
constant
satanic
presence
these
demons
were
said
to
be
the
hosts
of
satan
it
was
firmly
believed
that
the
satan
was
forever
hovering
about
the
christians
but
it
was
also
believed
that
the
sign
of
the
cross
or
a
few
drops
of
holy
water
or
the
name
of
mary
could
put
him
to
an
immediate
and
ignominious
flight
in
the
twelfth
century
however
the
subject
passed
into
an
entirely
new
phase
the
conception
of
a
witch
as
we
now
conceive
it
that
is
to
say
of
a
woman
who
had
entered
into
a
deliberate
compact
with
satan
who
was
endowed
with
the
power
of
working
miracles
whenever
she
pleased
and
who
was
continually
transported
through
the
air
to
the
sabbath
where
she
paid
her
homage
to
the
evil
one
first
appeared
the
panic
created
by
the
belief
at
first
advanced
slowly
but
after
a
time
with
a
fearfully
accelerated
rapidity
thousands
of
victims
were
sometimes
burnt
alive
in
a
few
years
every
country
in
europe
was
stricken
with
the
wildest
fever
hundreds
of
the
ablest
judges
were
selected
for
the
extirpation
of
this
crime
a
vast
literature
was
created
on
the
subject
and
it
was
not
until
a
considerable
portion
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
passed
away
that
the
executions
finally
ceased
the
vast
majority
of
those
accused
of
witchcraft
were
women
and
again
the
bible
furnished
the
authority
for
the
belief
that
women
were
inherently
wicked
that
the
fathers
of
the
church
believed
this
is
exemplified
by
the
statement
of
chrysostom
in
which
he
said
that
women
were
a
evil
a
natural
temptation
a
desirable
calamity
a
domestic
peril
a
deadly
fascination
and
a
painted
at
this
period
the
conception
of
a
witch
is
radically
different
from
that
which
was
prevalent
in
the
era
prior
to
this
one
the
popular
belief
of
the
witchcraft
ages
a
belief
sanctioned
by
most
of
the
learned
men
of
the
time
was
that
the
earth
swarmed
with
millions
upon
millions
of
demons
they
multiplied
by
reproduction
in
the
usual
way
by
the
accession
of
the
souls
of
wicked
men
of
women
dying
in
childbirth
of
children
of
men
killed
in
duels
the
air
was
filled
with
them
and
one
was
always
in
danger
of
inspiring
them
with
the
air
of
swallowing
them
in
food
and
drink
most
christian
writers
and
legendists
said
that
there
were
so
many
of
them
they
could
not
be
counted
but
wierus
took
a
census
of
them
and
reported
that
there
were
only
divided
into
companies
each
commanded
by
a
captain
or
prince
they
could
make
themselves
hideous
or
beautiful
as
suited
their
purposes
and
assume
any
shape
while
capable
of
appearing
at
any
time
they
preferred
the
night
between
friday
and
saturday
any
human
being
who
gave
up
to
them
his
immortal
soul
could
command
their
services
for
a
certain
time
occasionally
general
conferences
took
place
at
the
pleasure
of
satan
which
were
attended
by
all
the
demons
and
all
the
witches
these
were
held
on
the
brocken
or
other
high
mountain
upon
the
spot
where
they
met
nothing
would
ever
grow
afterwards
as
their
hot
feet
burnt
all
the
fecundity
out
of
the
soil
in
france
england
and
the
american
colonies
it
was
supposed
that
witches
made
their
trips
on
broomsticks
in
spain
and
italy
it
was
believed
that
they
twirled
on
the
back
of
the
devil
himself
who
for
the
occasion
transformed
himself
into
male
goat
on
no
account
would
a
witch
when
starting
for
a
sabbath
go
out
through
the
open
door
or
window
she
would
pass
through
the
keyhole
or
up
the
chimney
while
they
were
gone
inferior
demons
assumed
their
shape
and
lay
in
their
beds
feigning
illness
assembled
on
the
brocken
the
devil
as
a
goat
took
his
seat
on
the
throne
his
subjects
paid
their
respects
to
him
kissing
his
posterior
face
with
a
master
of
ceremonies
appointed
for
the
occasion
he
made
a
personal
examination
of
all
the
wizards
and
witches
to
see
if
they
had
the
secret
mark
about
them
by
which
they
were
stamped
as
the
own
this
mark
was
always
insensible
to
pain
and
it
was
the
sure
proof
of
witchery
when
found
by
the
inquisitor
any
witches
found
by
the
devil
not
so
marked
received
the
mark
from
him
then
and
there
also
a
nickname
then
they
all
sang
and
danced
furiously
if
a
stranger
came
to
be
admitted
silence
reigned
while
he
denied
his
salvation
spat
upon
the
bible
kissed
the
devil
and
swore
absolute
obedience
to
him
singing
and
dancing
was
resumed
a
mythical
formula
being
used
in
the
singing
when
tired
they
sat
down
and
told
of
their
evil
deeds
those
who
had
not
been
bad
enough
were
scourged
by
satan
himself
with
thorns
and
scorpions
until
they
could
neither
sit
nor
stand
then
came
a
dance
by
thousands
of
toads
who
were
conjured
out
of
the
ground
and
standing
on
their
hind
legs
kept
time
to
the
music
satan
evoked
from
bagpipes
or
a
trumpet
they
could
all
talk
and
asked
the
witches
to
give
them
the
flesh
of
unbaptized
babes
for
food
the
witches
promised
to
do
so
the
devil
told
them
to
remember
and
keep
their
word
and
then
stamped
his
foot
and
the
frogs
disappeared
instantly
into
the
earth
next
came
a
most
disgusting
banquet
except
for
a
few
of
the
most
wicked
witches
to
whom
were
given
rich
viands
on
golden
plates
and
expensive
wines
in
crystal
goblets
then
came
more
dancing
those
who
did
not
care
for
that
amused
themselves
by
mocking
the
sacrament
of
baptism
for
this
purpose
the
toads
were
again
called
up
and
sprinkled
with
filthy
water
the
devil
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
while
the
witches
repeated
a
formula
as
absurd
as
that
used
in
ordinary
baptisms
sometimes
the
devil
made
the
witches
take
off
their
clothes
and
dance
before
him
each
with
a
cat
tied
around
her
neck
and
another
dangling
behind
as
a
tail
sometimes
again
there
were
lascivious
orgies
at
all
disappeared
the
sabbath
was
over
the
story
of
the
inquisition
freethought
press
this
conception
of
a
witch
continued
from
the
twelfth
century
to
the
time
ceased
with
this
idea
of
a
witch
being
constantly
instilled
into
the
minds
of
their
listeners
the
clergy
set
loose
fervidly
religious
mobs
to
scourge
the
countries
of
innocent
women
with
the
entire
world
divided
into
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
the
hosts
of
satan
with
witches
abounding
in
the
air
in
the
water
and
in
the
food
and
with
their
immortal
souls
at
stake
the
frenzied
population
found
evidences
of
witchcraft
in
all
manner
of
happenings
pope
after
pope
set
the
seal
of
his
infallibility
upon
the
bloody
persecutions
at
length
came

who
on
the
of
december
sent
forth
his
bull
summis

of
all
documents
ever
issued
from
rome
imperial
and
papal
this
doubtless
first
and
last
caused
the
greatest
shedding
of
innocent
blood
yet
no
document
was
ever
more
clearly
dictated
by
conscience
inspired
by
the
scriptural
command
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
pope
innocent
exhorted
the
clergy
of
germany
to
leave
no
means
untried
to
detect
sorcerers
and
especially
those
who
by
evil
practice
destroy
vineyards
gardens
meadows
and
growing
crops
these
precepts
were
based
upon
various
texts
of
scripture
especially
upon
the
famous
statement
in
the
book
of
job
and
to
carry
them
out
inquisitors
were
authorized
by
the
pope
to
scour
europe
especially
germany
and
a
manual
was
prepared
for
their
use
the
malleus
maleficarum
warfare
of
science
another
important
and
much
discussed
department
was
the
connection
between
evil
spirits
and
animals
that
the
devil
could
assume
the
form
of
any
animal
he
pleased
seems
to
have
been
generally
admitted
and
it
presented
no
difficulty
to
those
who
remembered
that
the
first
appearance
of
that
personage
on
earth
was
as
a
serpent
and
that
on
one
occasion
a
legion
of
devils
had
entered
into
a
herd
of
swine
saint
jerome
also
assures
us
that
in
the
desert
anthony
had
met
a
centaur
and
a
faun
a
little
man
with
horns
growing
from
his
forehead
who
were
possibly
devils
and
at
all
events
at
a
later
period
the
lives
of
the
saints
represent
evil
spirits
in
the
form
of
animals
as
not
infrequent
lycanthropy
however
or
the
transformation
of
witches
into
wolves
presented
more
difficulty
the
history
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
conversion
of
lot
wife
were
it
is
true
eagerly
alleged
in
support
of
its
possibility
but
it
was
impossible
to
forget
that
augustine
appeared
to
regard
lycanthropy
as
a
fable
and
a
canon
of
the
council
of
ancyra
had
emphatically
condemned
the
belief
on
the
other
hand
that
belief
has
been
very
widely
diffused
among
the
ancients
it
had
been
accepted
by
many
of
the
greatest
and
most
orthodox
theologians
by
the
inquisitors
who
were
commissioned
by
the
popes
and
by
the
law
courts
of
most
countries
the
evidence
on
which
it
rested
was
very
curious
and
definite
if
the
witch
was
wounded
in
the
form
of
an
animal
she
retained
that
wound
in
her
human
form
and
hundreds
of
such
cases
were
alleged
before
tribunals
sometimes
the
hunter
having
severed
the
paw
of
his
assailant
retained
it
as
a
trophy
but
when
he
opened
his
bag
he
discovered
in
it
only
a
bleeding
hand
which
he
recognized
as
the
hand
of
his
wife
a
french
judge
named
boguet
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
devoted
himself
especially
to
the
subject
and
burnt
multitudes
of
lycanthropes
he
wrote
a
book
about
them
and
drew
up
a
code
in
which
he
permitted
ordinary
witches
to
be
strangled
before
they
were
burnt
but
excepted
lycanthropes
who
were
to
be
burnt
alive
now
let
us
examine
on
what
authority
the
popes
and
afterwards
the
reformers
so
rigorously
persecuted
the
witches
both
the
old
and
the
new
testaments
are
riddled
with
references
to
witches
wizards
and
devils
for
example
this
passage
from
exodus
xxii
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
from
matthew
viii
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
devils
coming
out
of
the
tombs
exceeding
fierce
so
that
no
man
might
pass
by
that
way
and
behold
they
cried
out
saying
have
we
to
do
with
thee
jesus
son
of
god
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
time
and
there
was
a
good
way
off
from
them
a
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
so
the
devils
besought
him
saying
thou
cast
us
out
suffer
us
to
go
away
into
the
herd
of
swine
and
he
said
unto
them
and
when
they
were
come
out
they
went
into
the
herd
of
swine
and
behold
the
whole
herd
of
swine
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
and
perished
in
the
waters
the
old
testament
therefore
definitely
commands
its
adherents
to
kill
and
the
new
testament
gives
a
brilliant
example
of
its
chief
magician
jesus
exorcising
devils
from
men
and
driving
them
into
swine
there
are
numerous
passages
of
the
bible
which
speak
of
the
devil
the
devil
and
his
angels
spirit
of
an
unclean
devil
dumb
spirit
foul
spirit
unclean
spirit
evil
spirit
witch
witchcraft
wizards
necromancers
satan
the
tempter
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
prince
of
devils
etc
these
passages
in
the
bible
were
at
once
the
chief
source
and
sanction
of
the
terrible
atrocities
which
extended
over
several
centuries
and
have
come
to
be
known
taken
collectively
as
the
witchcraft
persecutions
the
devil
with
his
subordinate
demons
and
the
human
beings
who
sold
their
souls
to
him
were
supposed
to
be
both
capable
and
guilty
of
blighting
the
crops
causing
the
lightning
bringing
destructive
storms
withholding
the
rain
drying
up
cows
killing
domestic
and
wild
beasts
afflicting
the
nations
with
pestilence
famine
and
war
causing
all
manner
of
diseases
betwitching
men
women
and
children
planting
doubts
in
the
mind
and
weeds
in
the
fields
and
in
brief
doing
about
everything
that
was
disagreeable
to
man
in
general
or
that
offended
the
priests
as
a
caste
thus
buttressed
by
the
bible
and
with
the
nearly
entire
current
of
church
literature
setting
in
the
same
direction
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
witchcraft
delusion
became
one
of
the
most
appalling
if
not
the
most
appalling
fact
in
the
development
of
the
christian
religion
there
is
extant
no
other
record
of
destruction
and
cruel
slaughter
growing
out
of
such
beliefs
in
supernatural
persons
and
powers
that
can
ever
begin
to
tell
such
a
story
of
degradation
and
mercilessness
as
the
record
made
by
the
christian
church
theologians
laid
stress
especially
upon
the
famous
utterances
of
the
psalmist
that
all
the
gods
of
the
heathens
are
devils
and
paul
the
things
which
the
gentiles
sacrifice
they
sacrifice
to
the
devils
those
suspected
of
heresy
and
witchcraft
must
confess
they
were
to
be
tortured
until
they
did
confess
this
made
suspicion
equivalent
to
confession
and
conviction
in
the
witch
trial
the
victim
must
not
only
incriminate
herself
but
her
accomplices
or
all
whom
she
knew
to
be
in
partnership
with
the
devil
she
was
bound
to
be
tortured
until
she
had
given
the
names
or
described
the
persons
of
those
she
had
seen
at
the
witches
sabbath
then
they
would
be
put
to
the
torture
and
the
process
repeated
it
was
not
in
human
nature
long
to
bear
the
awful
pain
soon
the
leading
questions
of
the
inquisitors
would
be
answered
as
they
wanted
them
answered
it
would
be
incredible
were
it
not
attested
by
such
a
multitude
of
witnesses
that
men
could
honestly
believe
that
testimony
so
extorted
had
the
slightest
value
but
it
is
indisputable
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
human
beings
were
sent
to
a
cruel
death
on
this
utterly
worthless
evidence
as
few
people
realize
the
degree
in
which
these
superstitions
were
encouraged
by
the
church
that
claims
infallibility
i
may
mention
that
the
reality
of
this
particular
crime
was
implied
and
its
perpetrators
anathematized
by
the
provincial
councils
or
synods
of
troyes
lyons
milan
tours
bourges
narbonne
ferrar

and
grenoble

rituals
of

evreux
paris
chalons
bologna
troyes
beauvais
meaux
rheims
and
by
the
decrees
of
a
long
series
of
bishops
the
infection
was
everywhere
germany
spain
portugal
france
italy
england
scotland
and
even
america
was
scourged
it
has
been
estimated
that
one
hundred
thousand
perished
in
germany
from
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
to
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
pope
gregory

a
great
mass
of
nonsense
to

other
chiefs

stringent
methods
against
the
stedingers

inhabiting
the
country
between

wrote
the

to
them
the
stedingers
in
different
shapes
sometimes
as
a
goose
or
duck

at
other
times
in
the
figure
of
a
pale
youth
with
a
melancholy
aspect
whose
embrace
fills
their
hearts
with
eternal
hatred
against
the
holy
church
of
christ
this
devil
presides
at
their
sabbath
when
they
all
kiss
him
and
dance
around
him
he
then
envelops
them
in
total
darkness
and
they
all
male
and
female
give
themselves
up
to
the
grossest
and
most
disgusting
debauchery
the
infallible
pope
of

the
result
was
that
the
stedingers
men
women
and
children
were
slain
the
cottages
and

burned
the
cattle
stolen
and
the

laid

theological
literature

slaughter
of

stedingers
an
average
illustration
of
the
evangelistic
methods
of
the
church
millions
of
men

were
tortured
strangled
drowned

burned
on
evidence
that

would
be
accepted
nowhere
unless
by
a
court

jury
composed
of
the
inmates
of
a
lunatic
asylum
if
even
by

it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the

severe

persecution

more
widespread

french
bishop
in

during

sixteenth
century
as
well
as
the
seventeenth
were
seen
the
most
horrible
examples
of
what
domination
of
superstitious
minds
by
ecclesiastics
could
do
nothing
was
natural
all
was
supernatural
the
entire
course
of
affairs
was
governed
not
by
their
antecedents
but
by
a
series
of
miracles
going
still
further
they
claimed
the
power
the
clergy
not
only
of
foretelling
the
future
state
but
also
of
controlling
it
and
they
did
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
by
their
censures
they
could
open
and
shut
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
if
this
were
not
enough
they
also
gave
out
that
a
word
of
theirs
could
hasten
the
moment
of
death

by
cutting
off
the
sinner
in
his
prime
could
bring
him

say
spent
his
previous
leisure
in
preparing
and
completing
this
place
of
torture
so
that
when
the
human
race
appeared
it
might
be
ready
for
their
reception
of
all
the
means
of
intimidation
employed
by
the
scotch
clergy
none
was
more
efficacious
than
the
doctrines
they
propounded
respecting
evil
spirits
and
future
punishment
on
these
subjects
they
constantly
uttered
the
most
appalling
threats
the
language
which
they
used
was
calculated
to
madden
men
with
fear
and
to
drive
them
to
the
depths
of
despair
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
world
was
overrun
by
evil
spirits
who
went
not
only
up
and
down
the
earth
but
also
lived
in
the
air
and
whose
business
it
was
to
tempt
and
hurt
mankind
their
number
was
infinite
and
they
were
to
be
found
at
all
places
and
in
all
seasons
at
their
head
was
satan
himself
whose
delight
it
was
to
appear
in
person
ensnaring
or
terrifying
every
one
he
met
with
this
object
he
assumed
various
forms
one
day
he
would
visit
the
earth
as
a
black
dog
on
another
day
as
a
raven
on
still
another
day
he
would
be
heard
in
the
distance
roaring
like
a
bull
he
appeared
sometimes
as
a
white
man
in
black
clothes
and
sometimes
he
became
a
black
man
in
black
clothes
when
it
was
remarked
that
his
voice
was
ghastly
that
he
wore
no
shoes
and
that
one
of
his
feet
was
cloven
his
stratagems
were
endless
for
in
the
opinion
of
divines
his
cunning
increased
with
his
age
and
having
been
studying
for
more
than
years
he
had
now
attained
to
unexampled
dexterity
he
could
and
he
did
seize
both
men
and
women
and
carry
them
away
through
the
air
usually
he
wore
the
garb
of
laymen
but
it
was
said
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
had
impudently
attired
himself
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
at
all
events
in
one
dress
or
other
he
frequently
appeared
to
the
clergy
and
tried
to
coax
them
over
to
his
side
in
that
of
course
he
failed
but
out
of
the
ministers
thus
tempted
few
indeed
could
withstand
him
he
could
raise
storms
and
tempests
he
could
work
not
only
on
the
mind
but
also
on
the
organs
of
the
body
making
men
hear
and
see
whatever
he
chose
of
his
victims
some
he
prompted
to
suicide
others
to
commit
murder
still
formidable
as
he
was
no
christian
was
considered
to
have
attained
to
a
full
religious
experience
unless
he
had
literally
seen
him
talked
to
him
and
fought
with
him
the
clergy
were
constantly
preaching
about
him
and
preparing
their
audiences
for
an
interview
with
their
great
enemy
the
consequence
was
that
the
people
became
almost
crazed
with
fear
whenever
the
preacher
mentioned
satan
the
consternation
was
so
great
that
the
church
resounded
with
sighs
and
groans
they
believed
that
the
devil
was
always
and
literally
at
hand
that
he
was
haunting
them
speaking
to
them
and
tempting
them
the
clergy
boasted
that
it
was
their
special
mission
to
thunder
out
the
wrath
and
curses
of
the
lord
in
their
eyes
the
deity
was
not
a
beneficent
being
but
a
cruel
and
remorseless
tyrant
they
declared
that
all
mankind
a
very
small
portion
only
excepting
were
doomed
to
eternal
misery
the
scotch
clergy
taught
their
hearers
that
the
almighty
was
sanguinary
and
so
prone
to
anger
that
he
raged
even
against
walls
and
houses
and
senseless
creatures
wreaking
his
fury
more
than
ever
and
scattering
desolation
on
every
side
the
people
credulous
and
ignorant
listened
and
believed
for
in
scotland
as
elsewhere
directly
the
clergy
succeeded
in
occupying
a
more
than
ordinary
amount
of
public
attention
they
availed
themselves
of
that
circumstance
to
propagate
those
ascetic
doctrines
which
while
they
strike
at
the
root
of
human
happiness
benefit
no
one
except
the
class
which
advocates
them
that
class
indeed
can
hardly
fail
to
reap
the
advantages
from
a
policy
which
by
increasing
the
apprehensions
to
which
the
ignorance
and
timidity
of
men
make
them
liable
does
also
increase
their
eagerness
to
fly
for
support
to
their
spiritual
advisers
and
the
greater
their
apprehension
the
greater
the
eagerness
the
history
of
civilization
in
england
james
i
of
england
had
become
imbued
with
the
idea
of
witchcraft
while
in
scotland
and
he
believed
that
his
stormy
passage
on
his
return
from
denmark
was
due
to
witches
this
storm
was
the
origin
of
one
of
the
most
horrible
of
the
many
horrible
scotch
trials
on
record
one
fian
was
suspected
of
having
aroused
the
wind
and
a
confession
was
wrung
from
him
by
torture
which
however
he
almost
immediately
retracted
every
form
of
torture
was
in
vain
employed
to
vanquish
his
obduracy
the
bones
of
his
legs
were
broken
into
small
pieces
in
the
boot
all
the
torments
that
scottish
law
knew
of
were
successively
applied
at
last
the
king
who
personally
presided
over
the
tortures
suggested
a
new
and
more
horrible
device
the
prisoner
who
had
been
removed
during
the
deliberation
was
brought
in
and
his
nails
upon
his
fingers
were
riven
and
pulled
off
with
an
instrument
called
in
scottish
a
which
in
england
we
call
a
or
and
under
everie
nayle
there
was
thrust
in
two
needles
over
even
up
to
the
heads
so
deeply
had
the
devil
entered
his
heart
that
he
utterly
denied
all
that
which
he
avouched
and
he
was
burnt
unconfessed
and
this
from
a
king
of
england
the
methods
of
obtaining
a
confession
were
as
follows
if
the
witch
was
obdurate
the
first
and
it
was
said
the
most
effective
method
of
obtaining
confession
was
by
what
was
termed
waking
her
an
iron
bridle
or
hoop
was
bound
across
her
face
with
four
prongs
which
were
thrust
into
her
mouth
it
was
fastened
behind
to
the
wall
by
a
chain
in
such
a
manner
that
the
victim
was
unable
to
lie
down
and
in
this
position
she
was
sometimes
kept
for
several
days
while
men
were
constantly
with
her
to
prevent
her
from
closing
her
eyes
for
a
moment
in
sleep
partly
in
order
to
effect
this
object
and
partly
to
discover
the
insensible
mark
which
was
the
sure
sign
of
a
witch
long
pins
were
thrust
into
her
body
at
the
same
time
as
it
was
a
saying
in
scotland
that
a
witch
would
never
confess
while
she
could
drink
excessive
thirst
was
added
to
her
torments
some
prisoners
have
been
waked
for
five
nights
one
it
is
said
even
for
nine
the
physical
and
mental
suffering
of
such
a
process
was
sufficient
to
overcome
the
resolution
of
many
and
to
distract
the
understanding
of
not
a
few
but
other
and
perhaps
worse
tortures
were
in
reserve
the
three
principal
ones
that
were
habitually
applied
were
the
pennywinks
the
boot
and
the
caschielawis
the
first
was
a
kind
of
thumbscrew
the
second
was
a
frame
in
which
the
leg
was
inserted
and
in
which
it
was
broken
by
wedges
driven
in
by
a
hammer
the
third
was
also
an
iron
frame
for
the
leg
which
was
from
time
to
time
heated
over
a
brazier
were
sometimes
applied
to
the
body
of
the
victim
we
read
in
a
contemporary
legal
register
of
one
man
who
was
kept
for
hours
in
vehement
torture
in
the
caschielawis
and
of
another
who
remained
in
the
same
frightful
machine
for
eleven
days
and
nights
whose
legs
were
broken
daily
for
fourteen
days
in
the
boots
and
who
was
so
scourged
that
the
whole
skin
was
torn
from
his
body
this
was
it
is
true
censured
as
an
extreme
case
but
it
was
only
an
excessive
application
of
the
common
torture
the
witches
were
commonly
strangled
before
they
were
burnt
but
this
merciful
provision
was
very
frequently
omitted
an
earl
of
wear
tells
how
with
a
piercing
yell
some
women
once
broke
from
the
slow
fire
consuming
them
struggled
for
a
few
moments
with
a
despairing
energy
among
the
spectators
but
soon
with
shrieks
of
blasphemy
and
wild
protestations
of
innocence
sank
writhing
in
agony
amid
the
flames
but
just
picture
this
scene
for
a
moment
the
horror
of
such
a
scene
what
a
crime
for
one
human
to
commit
against
another
a
burnt
offering
to
the
gods
how
well
pleased
the
almighty
god
must
have
been
with
the
stench
of
burning
human
flesh
rising
to
his
nostrils
and
how
well
he
must
have
rewarded
his
faithful
servants
for
was
this
not
done
in
his
name
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
as
lecky
points
out
in
his
famous
work
on
the
history
of
european
morals
such
incidents
are
but
illustrations
of
the
great
truth
that
when
men
have
come
to
regard
a
certain
class
of
their
fellow
creatures
as
doomed
by
the
almighty
to
eternal
and
excruciating
agonies
and
when
their
theology
directs
their
minds
with
intense
and
realizing
earnestness
to
the
contemplation
of
such
agonies
the
result
will
be
an
indifference
to
the
suffering
of
those
whom
they
deem
the
enemies
of
their
god
as
absolute
as
it
is
perhaps
possible
for
human
nature
to
attain
it
is
a
historical
fact
that
in
a
lady
of
rank
eufame
macalyane
sought
the
assistance
of
agnes
sampson
for
the
relief
of
pain
at
the
time
of
birth
of
her
two
sons
agnes
sampson
was
tried
before
king
james
for
her
heresy
was
condemned
as
a
witch
and
was
burned
alive
on
the
castle
hill
of
edinburgh
it
is
generally
said
that
the
last
execution
in
scotland
was
in
but
captain
burt
who
visited
the
country
in
speaks
of
a
woman
who
was
burnt
as
late
as
as
late
as
the
divines
of
the
associated
presbytery
passed
a
resolution
declaiming
their
belief
in
witchcraft
and
deploring
the
scepticism
that
was
then
general
the
pilgrim
fathers
brought
to
our
shores
the
seeds
of
the
witchcraft
delusion
at
a
time
when
it
was
rapidly
fading
in
england
and
again
history
furnishes
us
with
an
example
of
a
people
with
strong
religious
instincts
who
being
freed
from
their
persecutors
became
in
turn
the
most
violent
persecutors
of
those
that
did
not
profess
their
particular
creed
it
was
particularly
due
to
the
preaching
of
cotton
mather
that
a
panic
of
fear
was
created
through
the
new
england
colonies
ann
hibbons
was
tried
before
the
great
and
general
court
of
massachusetts
sentenced
and
hanged
on
the
of
june
goody
oliver
was
executed
as
a
witch
on
november
there
were
twenty
murders
in
and
these
before
a
civil
court
the
trials
took
place
before
the
illegal
court
of
oyer
and
terminer
appointed
by
governor
phipps
at
the
instigation
of
the
and
chief
justice
stoughton
and
joseph
dudley
formerly
governor
and
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
which
in
had
sent
goody
oliver
to
her
death
at
the
gallows
cotton
mather
defended
this
practice
in
his
book
the
wonders
of
the
invisible
world
and
increase
mather
the
father
of
cotton
was
equally
as
strenuous
in
the
witch
hunt
increase
mather
survived
this
massacre
thirty
years
and
his
son
five
years
longer
but
there
is
hardly
a
word
of
regret
or
sympathy
to
be
found
anywhere
even
in
their
private
diaries
and
correspondence
these
executions
in
massachusetts
form
one
of
the
darkest
pages
in
the
history
of
america
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
clergy
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
supported
both
in
practice
and
theory
the
witchcraft
delusion
but
when
we
find
the
ablest
minds
of
the
laity
bursting
into
print
with
a
vehement
defense
of
this
belief
it
is
difficult
for
us
in
the
present
day
to
conceive
of
such
folly
and
yet
today
we
have
able
minds
defending
a
precept
of
which
the
witchcraft
delusion
is
but
a
part
the
defenders
of
the
belief
witchcraft
who
were
men
of
great
and
distinguished
talent
maintained
that
there
was
no
fact
in
all
history
more
fully
attested
and
that
to
reject
it
would
be
to
strike
at
the
root
of
all
historical
evidence
of
the
miraculous
the
subject
was
examined
in
tens
of
thousands
of
cases
in
almost
every
country
in
europe
by
tribunals
which
included
the
acutest
lawyers
and
ecclesiastics
of
the
ages
on
the
scene
and
at
the
time
when
the
alleged
acts
had
taken
place
and
with
the
assistance
of
innumerable
sworn
witnesses
the
judges
had
no
motive
whatever
to
desire
the
condemnation
of
the
accused
and
as
conviction
would
be
followed
by
fearful
death
they
had
the
strongest
motives
to
exercise
their
power
with
caution
and
deliberation
the
whole
force
of
public
opinion
was
directed
constantly
and
earnestly
to
the
question
for
many
centuries
and
although
there
was
some
controversy
concerning
the
details
of
witchcraft
the
fact
of
its
existence
was
long
considered
undoubted
for
many
centuries
the
ablest
men
were
not
merely
unwilling
to
repudiate
the
superstition
but
they
often
pressed
forward
earnestly
and
with
the
utmost
conviction
to
defend
it
indeed
during
the
period
when
witchcraft
was
most
prevalent
there
were
few
writers
of
real
eminence
who
did
not
on
some
occasion
take
especial
pains
to
throw
the
weight
of
their
authority
into
the
scales
thomas
aquinas
was
probably
the
ablest
writer
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
he
assures
us
that
diseases
and
tempests
are
often
the
direct
act
of
the
devil
and
the
devil
can
transform
men
into
any
shape
and
transport
them
through
the
air
gerson
the
chancellor
of
the
university
of
paris
and
as
many
think
the
author
of
the
imitation
is
justly
regarded
as
one
of
the
master
minds
of
his
age
he
too
wrote
in
defense
of
this
belief
these
men
he
wrote
should
be
treated
with
scorn
and
indeed
sternly
corrected
who
ridicule
theologians
whenever
they
speak
of
demons
or
attribute
to
demons
any
effects
as
if
these
things
were
entirely
fabulous
this
error
has
arisen
among
some
learned
men
partly
through
want
of
faith
and
partly
through
weakness
and
imperfection
of
intellect
bodin
was
unquestionably
the
most
original
political
philosopher
who
had
arisen
since
machiavelli
and
he
devoted
all
his
learning
and
acuteness
to
crushing
the
rising
scepticism
on
the
subject
of
witches
the
truth
is
that
in
those
ages
ability
was
no
guarantee
against
error
for
the
single
employment
of
the
reason
was
to
develop
and
expand
premises
that
were
furnished
by
the
church
and
this
statement
is
as
valid
today
as
it
was
three
hundred
years
ago
bodin
was
esteemed
by
many
of
his
contemporaries
the
ablest
man
who
had
then
arisen
in
france
and
the
verdict
has
been
but
little
qualified
by
later
writers
amid
all
the
distractions
of
a
dissipated
and
an
intriguing
court
and
all
the
labors
of
a
judicial
position
he
had
amassed
an
amount
of
learning
so
vast
and
so
various
as
to
place
him
in
the
very
first
rank
of
the
scholars
of
his
nation
he
has
also
the
greater
merit
of
being
one
of
the
chief
founders
of
political
philosophy
and
political
history
and
of
having
anticipated
on
these
subjects
many
of
the
conclusions
of
our
own
day
in
his
judicial
capacity
he
had
presided
at
some
trials
of
witchcraft
he
had
brought
all
the
resources
of
his
scholarship
to
bear
upon
the
subject
and
he
had
written
a
great
part
of
his
demonomanie
des
sorciers
before
the
appearance
of
the
last
work
of
wier
john
wier
was
a
physician
of
cleves
who
had
in
published
a
work
which
he
called
de
præstigus
dæmonum
he
was
quite
convinced
that
the
world
was
peopled
by
crowds
of
demons
who
were
constantly
working
miracles
among
mankind
and
his
only
object
was
to
reconcile
his
sense
of
their
ubiquity
with
his
persuasion
that
some
of
the
phenomena
that
were
deemed
supernatural
arose
from
disease
wier
said
bodin
had
armed
himself
against
god
his
book
was
a
tissue
of
blasphemies
for
the
word
of
god
is
very
certain
that
he
who
suffers
a
man
worthy
of
death
to
escape
draws
the
punishment
upon
himself
as
the
prophet
said
to
king
ahab
that
he
would
die
for
having
pardoned
a
man
worthy
of
death
for
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
pardon
accorded
to
sorcerers
such
were
the
opinions
which
were
promulgated
towards
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
by
one
of
the
most
advanced
intellects
of
one
of
the
leading
nations
of
europe
at
that
time
promulgated
too
with
a
tone
of
confidence
and
of
triumph
that
shows
how
fully
the
writer
could
count
upon
the
religious
sympathies
of
his
readers
the
demonomanie
des
sorciers
appeared
in
with
a
man
of
the
caliber
of
bodin
writing
the
above
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
mobs
were
so
active
in
the
witch
hunt
for
as
lecky
cites
although
the
illiterate
can
not
follow
the
more
intricate
speculations
of
their
teachers
they
can
catch
the
general
tone
and
character
of
thought
which
these
speculations
produce
and
they
readily
apply
them
to
their
own
sphere
of
thought
in
montaigne
published
the
first
great
sceptical
work
in
the
french
language
the
vast
mass
of
authority
which
those
writers
loved
to
array
and
by
which
they
shaped
the
whole
course
of
their
reasoning
is
calmly
and
unhesitatingly
discarded
the
passion
for
the
miraculous
the
absorbing
sense
of
diabolical
capacities
have
all
vanished
like
a
dream
the
old
theological
measure
of
probability
has
completely
disappeared
and
is
replaced
by
a
shrewd
secular
common
sense
the
statements
of
the
witches
were
pronounced
intrinsically
incredible
the
dreams
of
a
disordered
imagination
or
the
terrors
of
the
rack
would
account
for
many
of
them
but
even
when
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
evidence
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
believe
it
after
all
montaigne
said
it
is
setting
a
high
value
upon
our
opinions
to
roast
men
alive
on
account
of
them
it
was
the
merit
of
montaigne
to
rise
by
the
force
of
his
masculine
genius
into
the
clear
world
of
reality
to
judge
the
opinions
of
his
age
with
an
intellect
that
was
invigorated
but
not
enslaved
by
knowledge
and
to
contemplate
the
systems
of
the
past
without
being
dazzled
by
the
reverence
that
had
surrounded
them
he
was
the
first
great
representative
of
the
modern
secular
and
rationalistic
spirit
the
strong
predisposition
of
montaigne
was
to
regard
witchcraft
as
the
result
of
natural
causes
and
therefore
though
he
did
not
attempt
to
explain
all
the
statements
which
he
had
heard
he
was
convinced
that
no
conceivable
improbability
could
be
as
great
as
that
which
would
be
involved
in
their
reception
thirteen
years
after
montaigne
charron
wrote
his
famous
treatise
on
wisdom
in
this
work
he
systematized
many
of
the
opinions
of
montaigne
voltaire
treated
the
whole
subject
with
a
scornful
ridicule
and
observed
that
since
there
had
been
philosophers
in
france
witches
had
become
proportionately
rare
in
joseph
glanvil
a
divine
who
in
his
day
was
very
famous
took
up
the
defense
of
the
dying
belief
the
sadducismus
triumphatus
which
he
published
is
probably
the
ablest
book
ever
published
in
defense
of
the
superstition
and
although
men
of
the
ability
of
henry
more
the
famous
philosopher
casaubon
the
learned
dean
of
canterbury
boyle
and
cudworth
came
to
his
defense
the
delusion
was
fast
losing
ground
lecky
points
out
that
by
this
time
the
sense
of
the
improbability
of
witchcraft
became
continually
stronger
till
any
anecdote
which
involved
the
intervention
of
the
devil
was
on
that
account
generally
ridiculed
this
spirit
was
exhibited
especially
among
those
whose
habits
of
thought
were
most
secular
and
whose
minds
were
least
governed
by
authority
but
the
belief
did
not
become
extinguished
immediately
in
france
in
the
civil
tribunal
of
chartres
tried
a
man
and
woman
named
soubervie
for
having
caused
the
death
of
a
woman
called
bedouret
they
believed
she
was
a
witch
and
declared
that
the
had
told
them
she
was
the
cause
of
an
illness
under
which
the
woman
soubervie
was
suffering
they
accordingly
drew
bedouret
into
a
private
room
held
her
down
upon
some
burning
straw
and
placed
a
iron
across
her
mouth
the
unhappy
woman
soon
died
in
extreme
agony
the
soubervies
confessed
and
indeed
exulted
in
their
act
at
their
trials
they
obtained
the
highest
possible
characters
it
was
shown
that
they
had
been
actuated
solely
by
superstition
and
it
was
urged
that
they
only
followed
the
highest
ecclesiastical
precedent
the
jury
recommended
them
to
mercy
and
they
were
only
sentenced
to
pay
francs
a
year
to
the
husband
of
the
victim
and
to
be
imprisoned
for
four
months
in
a
great
many
may
remember
the
hex
murder
case
near
lancaster
pennsylvania
in
this
is
scarcely
different
from
an
incident
which
had
occurred
in
in
wemding
germany
an
hysterical
woman
was
exorcised
by
the
capuchin
father
aurelian
who
accused
a
peasant
woman
of
bewitching
him
the
foregoing
has
shown
that
witchcraft
is
not
an
isolated
incident
in
the
history
of
christianity
as
the
ecclesiastics
would
have
us
believe
but
is
a
vital
part
of
their
religion
witchcraft
bears
the
same
relation
to
christianity
that
an
arm
bears
to
the
body
neither
can
be
removed
without
destroying
the
symmetrical
aspect
of
the
whole
witchcraft
is
an
integral
part
of
the
christian
religion
but
its
falsity
has
become
so
obvious
that
even
the
most
devout
have
had
to
abandon
it
yet
the
other
precepts
are
still
maintained
and
in
the
bible
which
is
claimed
to
be
infallible
something
is
forgotten
and
discarded
something
is
declared
to
be
ridiculous
and
yet
they
call
the
bible
infallible
again
if
witchcraft
is
given
up
why
not
the
chief
witch
of
the
bible
the
devil
yet
if
this
be
yielded
then
the
idea
of
atonement
the
central
doctrine
of
the
christian
church
must
also
go
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
if
this
be
god
word
did
god
err
when
he
said
it
if
he
erred
he
probably
did
so
in
many
other
things
if
he
did
not
christians
must
either
still
maintain
the
witchcraft
delusion
or
deny
the
bible
delusion
the
witchcraft
delusion
is
denied
and
forgotten
and
no
one
thinks
of
quoting
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
but
the
bible
delusion
despite
all
manner
of
ecclesiastical
sophistry
still
maintains
that
man
was
created
miraculously
some
years
ago
from
the
dust
of
the
earth
that
woman
was
made
from
a
bone
taken
from
the
side
of
man
that
language
came
into
existence
in
the
course
of
a
single
night
that
god
instituted
a
horrible
massacre
of
the
people
by
drowning
because
they
did
not
come
up
to
his
expectations
it
maintains
miracles
virgin
births
resurrections
from
the
dead
and
a
literal
heaven
and
hell
again
in
the
new
testament
matthew
tells
how
the
chief
magician
of
the
new
testament
jesus
exorcised
the
devils
from
men
and
drove
them
into
swine
what
could
be
more
explicit
if
men
were
possessed
of
devils
in
jesus
time
what
has
happened
to
these
devils
now
surely
jesus
could
not
misinterpret
his
own
words
or
deeds
if
the
religionists
contend
that
we
are
now
misinterpreting
the
bible
if
they
state
that
his
recorders
were
in
error
then
they
admit
the
error
of
the
entire
bible
for
it
is
illogical
for
one
part
to
be
true
and
another
to
be
false
when
both
are
components
of
an
infallible
statement
but
they
who
abandon
belief
in
maleficent
demons
and
in
witches
as
also
for
this
follows
in
beneficent
agents
such
as
angels
find
themselves
in
a
serious
dilemma
for
to
this
are
such
committed
if
jesus
who
came
that
he
might
destroy
the
devil
and
who
is
reported
among
other
proofs
of
his
divine
ministry
to
have
cast
out
demons
from
the
human
beings
and
in
one
case
to
have
permitted
a
crowd
of
infernal
agents
to
enter
into
a
herd
of
swine
if
he
verily
believed
that
he
did
these
things
and
if
it
be
true
that
the
belief
is
a
superstition
limited
to
the
ignorant
or
barbaric
mind
then
what
value
can
be
attached
to
any
statement
that
jesus
is
reported
to
have
made
about
the
spiritual
world
clodd
pioneers
of
evolution
the
old
adage
that
a
chain
is
just
as
strong
as
its
weakest
link
is
very
apt
in
this
case
a
belief
in
witches
is
part
of
the
bible
and
if
the
civilized
world
rejects
that
concept
it
must
reject
the
bible
for
it
is
no
longer
infallible
since
it
is
in
error
disregarding
the
internal
evidence
which
declares
the
bible
to
be
spurious
and
the
scientific
advances
which
have
proven
the
bible
to
be
a
myth
and
a
fable
if
man
still
insists
on
revealed
religion
he
must
admit
that
sorcery
and
witchcraft
are
an
integral
part
of
the
bible
teaching
he
must
still
either
believe
in
witchcraft
or
disbelieve
all
of
the
bible
for
again
one
part
can
not
be
true
and
another
false
of
an
infallible
statement
i
thoroughly
and
emphatically
agree
with
john
wesley
who
in
wrote
the
english
in
general
and
indeed
most
of
the
men
of
learning
in
europe
have
given
up
all
accounts
of
witches
and
apparitions
as
mere
old
wives
fables
i
am
sorry
for
it
and
i
willingly
take
this
opportunity
of
entering
my
solemn
protest
against
this
violent
compliment
which
so
many
that
believe
in
the
bible
pay
to
those
who
do
not
believe
it
i
owe
them
no
such
service
i
take
knowledge
that
these
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
outcry
which
has
been
raised
and
with
such
insolence
spread
through
the
land
in
direct
opposition
not
only
to
the
bible
but
to
the
suffrage
of
the
wisest
and
best
of
men
in
all
ages
and
nations
they
well
know
whether
christians
know
it
or
not
the
giving
up
of
witchcraft
is
in
effect
giving
up
the
lecky
in
that
masterful
work
the
rise
and
influence
of
rationalism
in
europe
from
which
i
have
so
freely
quoted
states
a
disbelief
in
ghosts
and
witches
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
characteristics
of
scepticism
in
the
seventeenth
century
yet
for
more
than
fifteen
hundred
years
it
was
universally
believed
that
the
bible
established
in
the
clearest
manner
the
validity
of
the
crime
and
that
an
amount
of
evidence
so
varied
and
so
ample
as
to
preclude
the
very
possibility
of
doubt
attested
its
continuance
and
its
prevalence
in
our
own
day
it
may
be
said
with
confidence
that
it
would
be
altogether
impossible
for
such
an
amount
of
evidence
to
accumulate
around
a
conception
which
has
no
substantial
basis
in
fact
and
yet
today
in
the
twentieth
century
we
do
have
an
amount
of
evidence
accumulated
around
a
conception
which
had
no
substantial
basis
of
fact
what
a
perfect
analogy
presents
itself
between
one
precept
of
revealed
religion
and
religion
in
its
entirety
in
the
seventeenth
century
scepticism
confined
itself
to
a
disbelief
in
witchcraft
one
particular
of
revealed
religion
in
the
twentieth
century
scepticism
expands
and
reveals
the
absurdity
of
all
revealed
religion
just
as
when
we
read
the
annals
of
witchcraft
today
we
sicken
with
the
horror
of
this
insane
conception
so
will
posterity
in
the
none
too
distant
future
perhaps
three
more
centuries
do
for
what
three
centuries
did
for
witchcraft
just
so
will
they
regard
revealed
religion
in
its
entirety
as
we
look
upon
the
one
factor
the
men
came
gradually
to
disbelieve
in
witchcraft
because
they
learned
gradually
to
look
upon
it
as
absurd
this
new
tone
of
thought
appeared
first
of
all
in
those
who
were
least
subject
to
theological
influences
and
soon
spread
through
the
educated
laity
and
last
of
all
took
possession
of
the
clergy
so
shall
it
be
with
all
religions
a
belief
that
was
held
for
years
in
the
comparatively
insignificant
period
of
years
sinks
into
oblivion
for
the
last
judicial
execution
occurred
in
switzerland
in
and
the
last
law
on
the
subject
the
irish
statute
was
repealed
in
it
is
not
therefore
too
much
of
a
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
conceive
what
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
will
think
of
all
religion
years
from
now
we
have
the
sterling
example
of
the
witchcraft
delusion
before
us
yes
despite
the
otherwise
brilliant
men
of
today
who
still
maintain
the
bible
delusion
and
the
hedgers
that
group
of
religious
apologists
who
form
those
various
sects
such
as
the
unitarians
the
humanists
etc
they
are
but
the
middle
ground
they
are
but
the
intermediate
between
the
delusionists
and
those
that
maintain
the
philosophy
that
eventually
must
triumph
the
philosophy
of
atheism
when
we
think
back
to
that
group
of
capable
men
headed
by
bodin
gerson
and
joseph
glanvil
who
turned
their
ability
and
learning
to
the
defense
of
the
witchcraft
delusion
we
find
the
answer
to
that
response
which
the
confused
of
this
age
give
when
confronted
with
the
incompatabilities
in
their
religion
namely
oh
well
more
brilliant
men
than
i
believe
in
this
delusion
bodin
gerson
and
glanvil
could
not
bolster
up
a
dying
belief
and
the
bodins
gersons
and
glanvils
of
today
can
not
long
bolster
up
the
dying
belief
in
all
religions
no
matter
what
their
ability
or
capacities
may
be
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall
the
past
teaches
us
what
the
future
may
be
but
there
is
still
much
work
to
be
done
chapter

religion
and
morality
current
religion
is
indirectly
adverse
to
morals
because
it
is
adverse
to
the
freedom
of
the
intellect
but
it
is
also
directly
adverse
to
morals
by
inventing
spurious
and
bastard
winwood
reade
martyrdom
of
man
it
had
been
formerly
asserted
by
theologians
that
our
moral
laws
were
given
to
man
by
a
supernatural
intuitive
process
however
professor

origin
and
development
of
the
moral
ideas
and
similar
researches
give
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
moral
ideas
and
practices
of
all
the
backward
fragments
of
the
human
race
and
conclusively
prove
the
social
nature
of
moral
law
the
moral
laws
have
evolved
much
the
same
as
physical
man
has
evolved
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
the
moral
laws
came
from
any
revelation
since
the
sense
of
moral
law
was
just
as
strong
amongst
civilized
peoples
beyond
the
range
of
christianity
or
before
the
christian
era
joseph
mccabe
commenting
on
professor
westermarck
work
states
all
the
fine
theories
of
the
philosophers
break
down
before
this
vast
collection
of
facts
there
is
no
intuition
whatever
of
an
august
and
eternal
law
and
the
less
god
is
brought
into
connection
with
these
pitiful
blunders
and
often
monstrous
perversions
of
the
moral
sense
the
better
what
we
see
is
just
man
mind
in
possession
of
the
idea
that
his
conduct
must
be
regulated
by
law
and
clumsily
working
out
the
correct
application
of
that
idea
as
his
intelligence
grows
and
his
social
life
becomes
more
complex
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
mind
of
the
savage
imperfectly
seeing
the
law
it
is
a
plain
case
of
the
ideas
of
the
savage
reflecting
and
changing
with
his
environment
and
the
interest
of
his
priests
justice
is
a
fundamental
and
essential
moral
law
because
it
is
a
vital
regulation
of
social
life
and
murder
is
the
greatest
crime
because
it
is
the
greatest
social
delinquency
and
these
are
inherent
in
the
social
nature
of
moral
law
moral
law
slowly
dawns
in
the
mind
of
the
human
race
as
a
regulation
of
a
man
relation
with
his
fellows
in
the
interest
of
social
life
it
is
quite
independent
of

since
it
has
entirely
different

there

and

society
is
the
school
in
which
men
learn
to
distinguish
between
right

wrong
the

the

for
all
the
first
moral

public

are
the
prototypes
of

westermarck
origin

development
of
the
moral

moral
ideas

have
their
source
in
social
life
it
is
only
in
a
more
advanced
society
that
moral
qualities
are
assumed
for
the
gods
and
indeed
it
is
known
that
in
some
primitive
tribes
the
gods
are
not
necessarily
conceived
as
good
they
may
have
evil
qualities
also
if
they
are

better
but
whether
they
are
good
or
bad
they
have
to
be
faced
as
facts
the
gods
in
short
belong
to
the
region
of
belief
while
morality
belongs
to
that
of
practice
it
is
in
the
nature
of
morality
that
it
should
be
implicit
in
practice
long
before
it
is
explicit
in
theory
morality
belongs
to
the
group
and
is
rooted
in
certain
impulses
that
are
a
product
of
the
essential
conditions
of
group
life
it
is
as
reflection
awakens
that
men
are
led
to
speculate
upon
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
moral
feelings
morality
whether
in
practice
or
theory
is
thus
based
upon
what
is
on
the
other
hand
religion
whether
it
be
true
or
false
is
in
the
nature
of
a
discovery
one
can
not
conceive
man
actually
ascribing
ethical
qualities
to
his
gods
before
he
becomes
sufficiently
developed
to
formulate
moral
rules
for
his
own
guidance
and
to
create
moral
laws
for
his
fellowmen
the
moralization
of
the
gods
will
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
man
really
modifies
his
gods
in
terms
of
the
ideal
human
being
it
is
not
the
gods
who
moralize
man
it
is
man
who
moralizes
the
gods
cohen
theism
or
atheism
in
the
formation
of
the
old
testament
the
moralization
of
yahveh
led
to
the
creation
of
a
god
who
coincided
more
with
the
morality
of
the
later
writers
the
god
elohim
rather
must
we
say
that
morality
begins
in
human
social
relations
and
passes
from
them
to
the
relations
maintained
with
the
other
life
and
with
the
gods
or
if
one
prefers
to
consider
ghosts
and
gods
as
inseparable
elements
of
the
primary
organism
then
we
should
say
that
morality
is
born
in
that
psychical
atmosphere
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that
fact
that
the
rise
and
development
of
morality
are
conditioned
by
belief
in
gods
and
in
immortality
merely
human
relations
are
sufficient
to
the
production
of
ethical
appreciations
the
invisible
ghosts
and
gods
would
never
have
been
thought
interested
in
the
morality
of
the
tribe
had
not
the
leaders
realized
the
importance
of
courage
of
loyalty
of
respect
for
neighbors
possessions
and
the
other
elementary
virtues
it
is
when
the
disastrous
consequences
of
their
absence
became
evident
that
the
gods
were
made
to
sanction
these
virtues
god
or
no
god
immortality
or
no
immortality
the
essential
morality
of
man
would
have
been
what
it
is
leuba
belief
in
god
and
immortality
the
best
that
is
in
man
is
generated
in
the
experiences
of
his
daily
life
the
attributing
of
moral
qualities
to
the
gods
was
a
much
later
development
in
the
evolution
of
the
moral
ideas
at
this
stage
of
our
development
man
is
fortified
by
a
sense
of
human
fellowship
and
in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory
has
long
since
given
up
the
assumption
that
he
needed
superhuman
beliefs
he
has
fully
recognized
the
independence
of
morality
from
superhuman
beliefs
james
mill
and
mill
taught
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
as
the
supreme
object
of
action
and
the
basis
of
morality
and
it
was
this
conception
that
introduced
the
new
ethical
principles
of
duty
to
posterity
this
conception
is
a
much
nobler
one
than
the
religious
interpretation
of
morality
to
consist
in
mainly
defining
what
man
duty
to
god
is
a
morality
whose
chief
selfish
inspiration
is
not
the
helping
of
one
fellowmen
but
the
saving
of
one
own
soul
a
secular
morality
teaches
that
what
man
thinks
says
and
does
lives
after
him
and
influences
for
good
or
ill
future
generations
this
is
a
higher
nobler
and
greater
incentive
to
righteousness
than
any
life
of
personal
reward
or
fear
of
punishment
in
a
future
life
there
are
today
a
rapidly
growing
number
of
eminent
moral
teachers
who
condemn
the
clinging
to
the
belief
of
personal
existence
after
death
as
a
hindrance
to
the
best
life
on
earth
professor
leuba
in
his
work
the
belief
in
god
and
immortality
concludes
that
these
facts
and
considerations
indicate
that
the
reality
of
the
belief
in
immortality
to
civilized
nations
is
much
more
limited
than
is
commonly
supposed
and
that
if
we
bring
into
calculation
all
the
consequences
of
the
belief
and
not
merely
its
gratifying
effects
we
may
even
be
brought
to
conclude
that
its
disappearance
from
among
the
most
civilized
nations
would
be
on
the
whole
a
gain
there
are
few
educated
men
nowadays
who
would
claim
that
morality
can
not
exist
apart
from
religion
theists
are
desperately
attempting
to
harmonize
a
primitive
theory
of
things
with
a
larger
knowledge
and
a
more
developed
moral
sense
morality
is
fundamentally
the
expression
of
those
conditions
under
which
associated
life
is
found
possible
and
profitable
and
that
so
far
as
any
quality
is
declared
to
be
moral
its
justification
and
meaning
must
be
found
in
that
direction
our
alleged
essential
dependence
upon
transcendental
beliefs
is
belied
by
the
most
common
experiences
of
daily
life
who
does
not
feel
the
absurdity
of
the
opinion
that
the
lavish
care
for
a
sick
child
by
a
mother
is
given
because
of
a
belief
in
god
and
immortality
are
love
of
father
and
mother
on
the
part
of
children
affection
and
serviceableness
between
brothers
and
sisters
and
truthfulness
between
business
men
essentially
dependent
upon
these
beliefs
what
sort
of
person
would
be
the
father
who
would
announce
divine
punishment
or
reward
in
order
to
obtain
the
love
and
respect
of
his
children
and
if
there
are
business
men
preserved
from
unrighteousness
by
the
fear
of
future
punishment
they
are
far
more
numerous
who
are
deterred
by
the
threat
of
human
law
most
of
them
would
take
their
chances
with
heaven
a
hundred
times
before
they
would
once
with
society
or
perchance
with
the
imperative
voice
of
humanity
heard
in
the
conscience
the
primary
motive
of
moral
standards
and
practices
is
man
desire
to
seek
happiness
and
avoid
pain
and
so
it
is
not
strange
that
morality
has
become
stronger
as
the
power
of
religion
has
weakened
right
through
history
it
has
been
the
social
instincts
that
have
acted
as
a
corrective
to
religious
extravagances
and
it
is
worth
noting
that
with
the
exception
of
a
little
gain
from
the
practice
of
casuistry
religions
have
contributed
nothing
towards
the
building
up
of
a
science
of
ethics
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
a
very
potent
cause
of
confusion
and
obstruction
fictitious
vices
and
virtues
have
been
created
and
the
real
moral
problems
lost
sight
of
it
gave
the
world
the
morality
of
the
prison
cell
instead
of
the
tonic
of
the
rational
life
and
it
was
indeed
fortunate
for
the
race
that
conduct
was
not
ultimately
dependent
upon
a
mass
of
teachings
that
had
their
origin
in
the
brains
of
savages
and
were
brought
to
maturity
during
the
darkest
period
of
european
civilization
and
we
know
that
the
period
during
which
the
influence
of
christian
theism
was
strongest
was
the
period
when
the
intellectual
life
of
civilized
man
was
at
its
lowest
morality
at
its
weakest
and
the
general
outlook
hopeless
religious
control
gave
us
heresy
hunts
jew
hunts
burning
for
witchcraft
and
magic
in
place
of
medicine
it
gave
us
the
inquisition
and
the
da
the
fires
of
smithfield
and
the
night
of
bartholomew
it
gave
us
the
war
of
sects
and
it
helped
powerfully
to
establish
the
sect
of
war
it
gave
us
life
without
happiness
and
death
cloaked
with
terror
the
christian
record
is
before
us
and
it
is
such
that
every
church
blames
the
others
for
its
existence
quite
as
certainly
we
can
not
point
to
a
society
that
has
been
dominated
by
freethinking
ideals
but
we
can
point
to
their
existence
in
all
ages
and
can
show
that
all
progress
is
due
to
their
presence
we
can
show
that
progressive
ideals
have
originated
with
the
least
and
have
been
opposed
by
the
most
religious
sections
of
society
the
puerile
conception
of
heaven
and
the
savage
conception
of
hell
are
still
in
modified
form
deemed
necessary
for
a
religious
morality
why
it
should
be
necessary
for
a
supreme
intelligence
to
make
all
things
straight
in
another
world
that
he
could
more
convincingly
rectify
in
this
one
is
a
conception
which
has
escaped
the
reason
of
a
freethinker
but
has
been
very
profitable
to
those
on

their
adherents
to

of

prevention

the

are

is
contradicted
by
the
facts
of

in

dark
ages
there

elevated

above

in

natures
and
to
which
intellectual
culture
is
propitious
for
as
we
become
more
and
more
clearly
enlightened
we
perceive
more
and
more
clearly
that
it
was
with
the
whole
human
population
as
it
was
with
the
primeval
clan
the
welfare
of

is

the
teachings
of
christianity
towards
marriage
furnishes
a
well
known
example
of
a
reactionary
philosophy
of
morals
the
views
of
paul
on
marriage
are
set
forth
in
i
corinthians
vii
now
concerning
the
things
whereof
ye
wrote
unto
me
it
is
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman
nevertheless
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
husband
let
the
husband
render
unto
the
wife
due
benevolence
and
likewise
also
the
wife
unto
the
husband
the
wife
hath
not
power
of
her
own
body
but
the
husband
and
likewise
also
the
husband
hath
not
power
of
his
own
body
but
the
wife
defraud
ye
not
one
the
other
except
it
be
with
consent
for
a
time
that
ye
may
give
yourselves
to
fasting
and
prayer
and
come
together
again
that
satan
tempt
you
not
for
your
incontinency
but
i
speak
this
by
permission
and
not
of
commandment
for
i
would
that
all
men
were
even
as
i
myself
but
every
man
has
his
proper
gift
of
god
one
after
this
manner
and
another
after
that
i
say
therefore
to
the
unmarried
and
widows
it
is
good
for
them
to
abide
even
as
i
but
if
they
can
not
contain
let
them
marry
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
burn
these
precepts
furnish
an
example
of
the
harm
that
can
be
done
when
man
follows
the
absurd
and
unsocial
decrees
of
an
ascetic
individual
written
in
a
barbaric
age
and
maintained
as
law
in
a
more
advanced
period
the
enlightened
physician
holds
that
it
is
not
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman
and
one
wonders
what
would
have
become
of
our
race
if
all
women
had
carried
paul
teaching
it
is
good
for
them
if
they
abide
even
as
i
into
practice
bertrand
russell
in
his
marriage
and
morals
has
gone
to
the
root
of
the
matter
when
he
states
he
does
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
there
may
be
any
positive
good
in
marriage
or
that
affection
between
husband
and
wife
may
be
a
beautiful
and
desirable
thing
nor
does
he
take
the
slightest
interest
in
the
family
fornication
holds
the
center
of
the
stage
in
his
thoughts
and
the
whole
of
his
sexual
ethics
is
arranged
with
reference
to
it
it
is
just
as
if
one
were
to
maintain
that
the
sole
reason
for
baking
bread
is
to
prevent
people
from
stealing
cake
but
then
it
is
too
much
to
expect
of
a
man
living
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
to
have
known
the
psychology
of
the
emotions
but
we
do
know
the
great
harm
that
his
ascetic
principles
have
done
paul
took
the
standpoint
that
sexual
intercourse
even
in
marriage
is
regrettable
this
view
is
utterly
contrary
to
biological
facts
and
has
caused
in
its
adherents
a
great
deal
of
mental
disorder
paul
views
were
emphasized
and
exaggerated
by
the
early
church
and
celibacy
was
considered
holy
men
retired
into
the
desert
to
wrestle
with
satan
and
when
their
abnormal
manner
of
living
fired
their
imagination
with
erotic
visions
mutilated
their
bodies
to
cleanse
their
souls
there
is
no
place
in
the
moral
history
of
mankind
of
a
deeper
or
more
painful
interest
than
this
ascetic
epidemic
a
hideous
sordid
and
emaciated
maniac
without
knowledge
without
patriotism
without
natural
affections
passing
his
life
in
a
long
routine
of
useless
and
atrocious
and
quailing
before
the
ghastly
phantoms
of
his
delirious
brain
had
become
the
ideal
of
the
nations
which
had
known
the
writings
of
plato
and
cicero
and
the
lives
of
socrates
and
cato
history
of
european
morals
this
concept
that
the
closest
of
association
between
man
and
wife
is
an
obnoxious
deed
has
strewn
its
evil
influence
down
through
the
ages
to
the
present
day
the
stealth
and
obscurity
placed
upon
sexual
matters
has
had
its
roots
so
firmly
fixed
in
our
manner
of
dealing
with
this
purely
normal
function
that
at
this
late
date
medical
science
is
just
beginning
to
eradicate
the
evils
it
is
now
well
recognized
by
educators
and
physicians
and
all
individuals
that
it
is
extremely
harmful
for
men
women
and
children
to
be
kept
in
artificial
ignorance
of
the
facts
relating
to
sexual
affairs
the
obscurantism
placed
upon
sexual
matters
has
caused
more
physical
and
mental
distress
than
most
of
our
organic
diseases
the
physician
is
constantly
correcting
the
abnormal
conceptions
that
exist
the
sex
act
had
become
something
in
the
nature
of
a
crime
which
could
not
be
avoided
instead
of
assuming
the
manifestation
of
the
consummation
of
the
greatest
love
and
tenderness
that
can
exist
between
two
individuals
keenly
attuned
to
the
natural
desires
of
a
natural
act
the
love
of
man
and

at
its
best
is
free
and
fearless
compounded
of
body
and
mind
in
equal
proportions
not
dreading
to
idealize
because
there
is
a
physical
basis
not
dreading
the
physical
basis
lest
it
should
interfere
with
the
idealization
to

to
fear

russell
marriage
and
morals
religion
has
brutalized
the
marital
relations
and
lecky
dealing
with
this
subject
states
the
tender
love
which
it
elicits
the
holy
and
beautiful
domestic
qualities
that
follow
in
its
train
were
almost
absolutely
omitted
from
consideration
the
object
of
the
ascetic
was
to
attract
men
to
a
life
of
virginity
and
as
a
necessary
consequence
marriage
was
treated
as
an
inferior
state
it
was
regarded
as
being
necessary
indeed
and
therefore
justifiable
for
the
propagation
of
the
species
and
to
free
men
from
great
evils
but
still
as
a
condition
of
degradation
from
which
all
who
aspired
to
real
sanctity
could
fly
to
down
by
the
axe
of
virginity
the
wood
of
marriage
was
in
the
energetic
language
of
jerome
the
end
of
the
saint
and
if
he
consented
to
praise
marriage
it
was
merely
because
it
produced
virgins
indeed
the
entire
ascetic
attitude
was
well
summed
up
by
jerome
when
exhorting
heliodorus
to
desert
his
family
and
become
a
hermit
he
expatiated
with
foul
minuteness
on
every
form
of
natural
affection
he
desired
him
to
violate
though
your
little
nephew
twine
his
arms
around
your
neck
though
your
mother
with
dishevelled
hair
and
tearing
her
robe
asunder
point
to
the
breast
with
which
she
suckled
you
though
your
father
fall
down
on
the
threshold
before
you
pass
over
your
father
body
you
say
that
scripture
orders
you
to
obey
parents
but
he
who
loves
them
more
than
christ
loses
his
soul
it
has
only
been
with
the
advance
of
secular
literature
that
the
degrading
assumption
of
paul
that
marriage
is
to
be
regarded
solely
as
a
more
or
less
legitimate
outlet
for
lust
has
been
discarded
and
the
act
of
love
as
applied
to
marriage
has
come
to
have
any
meaning
and
in
this
modern
day
the
conception
of
the
relationship
of
the
sex
act
to
marriage
is
far
from
being
on
the
high
plane
where
it
rightly
belongs

marriage
in
the
orthodox
christian
doctrine
has
two
purposes
one
that
recognized
by
paul
the
other
the
procreation
of
children
the
consequence
has
been
to
make
sexual
morality
even
more
difficult
than
it
was
made
by
paul
not
only
is
sexual
intercourse
only
legitimate
within
marriage
but
even
between
husband
and
wife
it
becomes
a
sin
unless
it
is
hoped
that
it
will
lead
to
pregnancy
the
desire
for
legitimate
offspring
is
in
fact
according
to
the
catholic
church
the
only
motive
which
can
justify
sexual
intercourse
but
this
motive
always
justifies
it
no
matter
what
cruelty
may
accompany
it
if
the
wife
hates
sexual
intercourse
if
she
is
likely
to
die
of
another
pregnancy
if
the
child
is
likely
to
be
diseased
or
insane
if
there
is
not
enough
money
to
prevent
the
utmost
extreme
of
misery
that
does
not
prevent
the
man
from
being
justified
in
insisting
on
his
conjugal
rights
provided
only
that
he
hopes
to
beget
a
child
what
effect
has
christianity
had
upon
our
moral
life
upon
crime
sexual
immorality
prostitution
and
perversion
these
blights
upon
our
moral
character
existed
long
before
christianity
and
after
christianity
but
what
effectual
check
has
christianity
contributed
the
agitation
concerning
increased
crime
after
the
recent
world
conflict
has
brought
this
subject
to
the
fore
and
aroused
a
great
deal
of
discussion
and
consideration
of
this
problem
in
its
relation
to
religion
we
have
but
one
undeniable
fact
to
bring
before
the
thinking
public
an
examination
of
the
statistics
of
penal
institutions
reveals
that
practically
all
criminals
are
religious
and
proportionately
smaller
numbers
of
criminals
are
although
church
members
nowhere
constitute
even
half
the
population
outside
the
prisons
they
constitute
from
eighty
to
per
cent
of
the
population
inside
the
prison
this
can
be
verified
by
reference
to
any
census
of
any
penal
institution
as
strangely
as
this
may
strike
a
great
many
readers
just
so
strange
did
it
appear
at
one
time
to
the
multitude
that
the
earth
was
round
it
is
years
since
the
earth
was
proven
to
be
round
yet
there
is
a
large
colony
of
christians
near
chicago
officially
maintaining
that
the
earth
is
as
flat
and
as
the
bible
states
neither
christianity
nor
any
religious
creed
has
proved
an
effectual
check
on
civil
crime
the
prostitute
has
been
hounded
and
abused
by
ecclesiastics
since
biblical
times
yet
it
is
only
true
to
say
that
the
religionist
is
not
vitally
interested
in
prostitution
outwardly
he
may
pour
forth
a
verbal
barrage
of
condemnation
but
if
he
believes
he
can
save
her
immortal
soul
ahunting
he
goes
he
does
not
attempt
to
ameliorate
the
social
welfare
of
this
poor
degraded
individual
as
he
thinks
her
pitiful
condition
in
the
everlasting
present
on
this
earth
interests
him
not
at
all
although
it
is
this
existence
about
which
he
raves
his
only
interest
is
in
redeeming
her
soul
not
her
body
if
when
the
religionist
tells
the
prostitute
that
only
those
who
believe
in
christ
as
god
in
his
virgin
birth
and
in
his
resurrection
in
the
body
will
go
to
heaven
and
she
agrees
and
repents
all
is
well
the
religionist
has
saved
a
soul
and
the
prostitute
goes
about
her
business
of
spreading
hideous
venereal
disease
to
others
whose
souls
are
saved
by
believing
in
christ
as
a
god
her
soul
is
saved
and
safe
but
the
scholar
the
poet
the
scientist
the
benefactor
to
mankind
all
those
who
make
this
life
bearable
and
livable
their
souls
must
roast
in
hell
forever
if
they
do
not
believe
in
the
creed
divine
justice
the
greatest
number
of
prostitutes
are
religious
yet
prostitution
continues
to
flourish
the
ecclesiastic
condemns
the
prostitute
as
the
cause
never
stopping
to
think
that
the
cause
must
have
an
effect
and
that
prostitution
is
but
the
effect
the
cause
is
our
economic
conditions
prostitution
is
purely
a
problem
and
the
more
the
ecclesiastic
keeps
his
hands
off
the
problem
the
sooner
will
the
condition
be
remedied
to
its
best
attempts
to
repress
prostitution
without
changing
the
economic
organization
will
always
result
in
failure
prostitution
has
always
existed
and
will
continue
to
exist
until
our
economic
system
has
undergone
a
radical
change
so
long
as
girls
have
to
fight
with
starvation
or
with
beggarly
wages
so
long
as
men
are
deterred
from
early
marriage
by
inability
to
support
a
family
and
so
long
as
many
married
men
remain
polygamous
in
their
tastes
just
so
long
will
prostitution
exist
but
we
have
seen
that
the
clergy
is
never
anxious
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
few
to
tyrannize
the
many
and
since
prostitution
is
an
economic
problem
religion
never
has
and
never
will
be
of
any
help
in
this
case
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
are
many
instances
of
a
few
centuries
ago
where
the
church
in
a
period
of
temporary
financial
distress
has
owned
well
paying
brothels
when
we
think
of
morality
we
are
apt
to
concentrate
more
on
sexual
morality
than
on
the
more
obtuse
moral
duties
religion
has
from
time
immemorial
been
held
up
to
our
minds
as
a
great
force
in
the
production
of
this
morality
that
is
another
myth
in
our
own
country
it
is
a
trite
phrase
that
a
man
has
a
puritan
code
of
ethics
or
as
straight
laced
as
a
puritan
when
the
puritan
fathers
landed
in
this
country
they
began
an
existence
that
has
revealed
to
the
world
for
all
time
the
value
of
a
burning
religious
zeal
in
a
sense
they
showed
this
zeal
in
regard
to
the
witchcraft
delusion
coming
as
they
did
to
avoid
religious
persecution
in
their
own
native
country
they
should
have
established
a
colony
which
for
meekness
and
beneficence
would
have
shown
the
value
of
a
true
religious
fervor
instead
the
persecuted
immediately
became
the
persecutors
again
proving
the
worth
of
a
mind
that
is
imbued
with
a
dominating
religious
zeal
secondly
the
principal
vocation
and
recreation
of
these
fathers
was
their
religion
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
in
such
a
truly
religious
atmosphere
morality
should
have
reached
its
zenith
of
perfection
what
actually
happened
is
well
illustrated
in
a
very
informative
and
case
reporting
work
by
rupert
hughes
the
novelist
facts
about
puritan
morals
everybody
seems
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
behavior
of
the
early
settlers
of
new
england
was
far
above
normal
nobody
seems
to
take
the
trouble
to
verify
this
assumption
the
facts
are
amazingly
opposite
the
puritans
admitted
incessantly
that
they
were
exceedingly
bad
the
records
sustain
them
the
puritans
wallowed
in
every
known
form
of
wickedness
to
a
disgusting
degree
considering
the
extremely
meagre
population
of
the
early
colonies
they
were
appallingly
busy
in
evil
i
do
not
refer
to
the
doctrinal
crimes
that
they
artificially
construed
and
dreaded
and
persecuted
with
such
severity
that
england
had
to
intervene
the
crimes
of
being
a
quaker
a
presbyterian
which
they
punished
with
lash
with
the
gallows
and
with
exile
i
do
not
refer
to
their
inclusion
of
lawyers
among
keepers
of
disorderly
houses
and
people
of
i
refer
to
what
every
people
savage
or
civilized
has
forbidden
by
law
murder
arson
adultery
infanticide
drunkenness
theft
rape
sodomy
and
bestiality
the
standard
of
sexual
morality
among
the
unmarried
youth
was
lower
in
puritan
england
than
it
is
today
for
both
sexes
it
is
important
that
the
truth
be
known
is
religion
is
church
membership
a
help
to
virtue
the
careless
will
answer
without
hesitation
yes
of
course
the
statistics
when
they
are
not
smothered
cry
no
if
keeps
down
sin
then
the
puritans
should
have
been
sinless
because
they
compelled
everybody
to
go
to
church
they
actually
regarded
absence
from
church
as
worse
than
adultery
or
theft
they
dragged
prisoners
from
jail
under
guard
to
church
they
whipped
old
men
and
women
bloodily
for
staying
away
they
fined
the
and
confiscated
their
goods
and
their
cattle
to
bankruptcy
when
all
else
failed
they
used
exile
disobedience
of
parents
was
voted
a
capital
offense
and
so
was
even
to
the
extent
of
picking
up
sticks
yet
as
a
result
of
all
this
religion
the
sex
life
of
the
puritan
was
abnormal
their
sex
sins
were
enormous
their
form
of
spooning
was
an
astonishing
custom
that
permitted
lovers
to
lie
down
in
bed
together
in
the
dark
under
covers
they
were
supposed
to
keep
all
their
clothes
on
but
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
somewhere
for
the
number
of
illegitimate
children
and
premature
children
was
stupefying
dunton
tells
us
that
there
hardly
passed
a
court
day
in
massachusetts
without
some
convictions
for
fornication
and
although
the
penalty
was
fine
and
whipping
the
crime
was
very
frequent
nothing
i
repeat
would
have
surprised
the
puritans
more
than
to
learn
that
their
descendants
accepted
them
as
saints
they
wept
wailed
and
refused
to
be
comforted
they
were
terrified
and
horrified
by
their
own
wickedness
the
harsh
granite
puritan
of
our
sermons
on
statues
and
frescoes
was
unknown
in
real
life
the
real
puritan
zealot
spent
an
incredible
amount
of
his
time
in
weeping
like
a
silly
old
woman
famous
puritan
preachers
boast
of
lying
on
a
floor
all
night
and
drenching
the
carpet
with
their
tears
their
church
services
according
to
their
own
accounts
must
have
been
cyclones
of
hysteria
with
the
preacher
sobbing
and
streaming
and
the
congregation
in
a
state
of
ululant
frenzy
with
men
and
women
fainting
on
all
sides
the
authorities
are
the
best
possible
not
the
reports
of
travelers
or
the
satires
of
enemies
but
the
statements
of
the
puritans
themselves
governors
eminent
clergymen
and
the
official
records
of
the
colonies
hereafter
anybody
who
refers
to
the
puritans
as
people
of
exemplary
life
or
morality
above
the
ordinary
is
either
ignorant
or
a
liar
in
our
own
day
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
crime
and
vice
among
the
clergy
most
horrible
murders
abound
by
ministers
of

and
for
ministers
published
and
unpublished
adulteries
seductions
rapes
elopements
embezzlements
homosexual
entanglements
bigamies
financial
turpitudes
are
far
more
numerous
than
they
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
clerical
population
governor
bradford
breaks
out
in
his
bewilderment
and
unwittingly
condemns
the
whole
spirit
and
pretense
of
puritanism
the
puritans
fled
from
the
wicked
old
world
for
purity
sake
they
were
relentless
in
prayer
they
were
absolutely
under
the
control
of
the
church
and
clergy
and
yet
their
governor
says
that
sin
flourished
more
in
plymouth
colony
than
in
vile
london
if
our
people
are
wicked
nowadays
because
they
lack
religion
what
shall
be
said
of
the
puritans
who
were
far
more
wicked
though
they
lived
moved
and
had
their
being
in
an
atmosphere
so
surcharged
with
religion
that
children
and
grown
persons
lay
awake
all
night
sobbing
and
rolling
on
the
floor
in
search
of
secret
sins
that
they
could
not
remember
well
enough
to
repent
it
is
well
to
remember
that
there
has
perhaps
never
been
in
history
a
community
in
which
christianity
had
so
perfect
a
laboratory
in
which
to
experiment
the
very
purpose
of
the
colony
was
announced
as
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
the
bible
was
the
law
book
the
colony
lacked
all
the
things
on
which
preachers
lay
the
blame
for
ungodliness
yet
every
infamy
known
to
history
from
fiendish
torture
to
luxurious
degeneracy
flourished
amazingly
this
ancient
and
impregnable
fact
has
been
ignored
the
records
have
been
studiously
veiled
in
a
cloud
of
misty
reverence
and
concealed
under
every
form
of
rhetoric
known
to
apologists
we
can
only
conclude
that
religion
does
not
seem
to
act
as
an
effectual
check
against
sexual
immorality
furthermore
high
moral
principles
can
be
inculcated
without
any
religious
background
and
have
been
in
spite
of
religion
a
man
who
is
moral
because
of
his
reason
and
his
sensibilities
and
his
comprehension
of
the
necessary
social
structure
of
the
world
is
a
far
better
citizen
than
the
man
who
feebly
attempts
a
moral
life
because
he
expects
a
mythical
existence
in
a
delusional
heaven
or
wishes
to
avoid
a
secular
code
of
morals
based
upon
the
best
experiences
of
communal
and
national
life
would
place
its
highest
obligation
not
to
a
deity
but
to
the
welfare
of
all
fellowmen

for

with

the

then
we
must
admit
that

still

more

battlefield
their
common
religious
belief
did
not
render
the
war
less
bitter
nor
less
bloodthirsty
is
it
not
a
fact
that
if
the
christian
nations
of
the
world
would
only
live
at
peace
together
war
would
be
impossible
neither
mohammedan
nations
nor
japan
could
threaten
when
the
christian
speaks
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
he
means
a
brotherhood
of
only
what
kind
of
brotherhood
did
christians
bestow
on
jews
or
heretics
in
the
middle
ages
was
it
the
brotherhood
of
man
that
christianity
bestowed
on
the
conquered
mexican
and
peruvian
nations
and
on
the
indians
of
our
own
country
if
christianity
had
expended
as
much
energy
in
teaching
its
adherents
the
fundamentals
of
a
sane
social
life
as
it
did
to
prepare
mankind
for
a
mythical
life
in
heaven
civilization
would
be
today
greatly
in

of
where
it

does
any
one
believe
that
jew
mohammedan
catholic
and
protestant
can
long
live
in
peace
together
common
social
needs
bring
mankind
together
but
religion
drives
them
apart
there
can
never
be
a
lasting
peace
until
the
myth
of
god
is
dispelled
forever
from
the
minds
of
men
then
and
then
only
can
the

christianity
and
slavery
during
the
american
struggle
against
the
slave
system
did
more
to
wean
religious
and
men
and
women
from
the
old
interpretation
of
scripture
than
the
use
of
it
to
justify
andrew
dickson
white
the
christian
church
has
had
the
audacity
in
modern
times
to
proclaim
that
it
had
abolished
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
any
righteous
man
could
make
that
contention
remembering
that
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
slavery
became
illegal
in
christian
countries
with
one
exception
abyssinia
the
oldest
of
the
christian
countries
which
still
maintains
slavery
in
our
own
country
a
nation
had
to
be
embroiled
in
a
civil
war
before
slavery
could
be
abolished
abolished
by
christianity
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
christianity
has
been
dominant
in
most
civilized
countries
since
the
third
century
and
when
the
traffic
in
human
flesh
flourished
right
through
those
centuries
in
which
christianity
was
most
powerful
a
reference
to
the
facts
show
that
this
claim
is
as
spurious
as
many
others
which
the
ecclesiastics
have
boldly
affirmed
throughout
the
ages
for
not
only
is
this
contrary
to
the
truth
but
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
it
was
only
by
the
aid
and
sanction
of
the
theological
forces
that
slavery
was
able
to
degrade
our
civilization
as
long
as
it
did
on
referring
to
that
legend
which
has
been
the
source
of
most
of
our
suffering
and
inhumanity
the
bible
a
direct
sanction
for
slavery
is
given
in
the
old
testament
leviticus
xxv
gives
explicit
instructions
as
to
where
and
from
whom
slaves
should
be
bought
and
sanctions
the
repulsive
feature
of
separation
of
the
slave
from
his
family
leviticus
xxvii
gives
the
price
of
human
beings
the
koran
which
the
christians
look
upon
as
a
ridiculous
smattering
of
utterances
of
a
spurious
prophet
sets
a
superior
example
to
the
christian
divine
revelations
god
hath
ordained
that
your
brothers
should
be
your
slaves
therefore
let
him
whom
god
hath
ordained
to
be
the
slave
of
his
brother
his
brother
must
give
him
of
the
clothes
wherewith
he
clotheth
himself
and
not
order
him
to
do
anything
beyond
his
power
a
man
who
illtreats
his
slave
will
not
enter
paradise
whoever
is
the
cause
of
separation
between
mother
and
child
by
selling
and
giving
god
will
separate
him
from
his
friends
on
the
day
of
resurrection
the
new
testament
follows
the
old
testament
and
there
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
its
contents
anything
to
suggest
the
elimination
of
this
practice
jesus
did
not
condemn
this
practice
but
accepted
slavery
as
he
accepted
most
institutions
about
him
and
all
superstitions
the
teachings
of
paul
on
the
question
of
slavery
are
clear
and
explicit
pope
leo
in
his
letter
of
to
the
bishop
of
brazil
remarks
when
amid
the
slave
multitude
whom
she
has
numbered
among
her
children
some
led
astray
by
some
hope
of
liberty
have
had
recourse
to
violence
and
sedition
the
church
has
always
condemned
these
unlawful
efforts
and
through
her
ministers
has
applied
the
remedy
of
patience
peter
was
addressing
himself
especially
to
the
slaves
when
he
wrote
for
this
is
thankworthy
if
for
conscience
towards
god
a
man
endures
sorrows
suffering
wrongfully
the
church
certainly
saw
nothing
wrong
with
slavery
when
she
preached
patience
to
her
slaves
it
did
not
condemn
slavery
but
condemned
the
slaves
for
revolting
this
in
in
the
encyclopedia
of
religion
and
ethics
is
found
there
is
no
explicit
condemnation
in
the
teaching
of
our
lord
it
remains
true
that
the
abolitionist
could
point
to
no
one
text
in
the
gospels
in
defense
of
his
position
while
those
who
defended
slavery
could
appeal
at
any
rate
to
the
letter
of
scripture
it
is
true
that
slavery
existed
under
pagan
civilization
but
there
it
represented
a
phase
of
social
development
while
christian
slavery
stood
for
a
deliberate
retrogression
in
social
life
it
was
seneca
who
said
live
gently
and
kindly
with
your
slave
and
admit
him
to
conversation
with
you
to
council
with
you
and
to
share
in
your
meals
think
of
what
would
have
occurred
if
one
of
our
philosophers
had
admonished
a
christian
in
the
above
manner
we
are
apt
to
think
of
the
ancient
slave
as
being
identical
with
the
miserable
and
degraded
being
that
disgraced
christian
countries
less
than
a
century
ago
this
however
is
far
from
the
truth
the
roman
slave
did
not
of
necessity
lack
education
slaves
were
to
be
found
who
were
doctors
writers
poets
philosophers
and
moralists
plautus
phædrus
terence
epictetus
were
slaves
slaves
were
the
intimates
of
men
of
all
stations
of
life
even
the
emperor
certainly
it
never
dawned
on
the
roman
mind
to
prohibit
education
to
the
slave
that
was
left
for
the
christian
world
and
almost
within
our
own
time
for
a
good
account
of
the
close
association
of
christianity
with
slavery
see
slavery
and
labor
chapman
in
rome
the
slave
kept
his
individuality
and
outwardly
there
was
no
distinction
in
color
and
clothing
there
was
very
little
sound
barrier
between
the
slave
and
the
freeman
the
slave
attended
the
same
games
as
the
freeman
participated
in
the
affairs
of
the
municipality
and
attended
the
same
college
the
ancients
kept
the
bodies
of
their
slaves
in
bondage
but
they
placed
no
restraint
upon
the
mind
and
no
check
upon
his
education
it
has
even
been
said
that
the
slave
class
of
antiquity
really
corresponded
to
our
free
laboring
class
it
is
also
well
known
that
a
slave
by
his
own
earnings
was
able
to
purchase
his
freedom
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
there
can
be
no
comparison
therefore
between
pagan
and
christian
slavery
except
to
the
detriment
of
the
latter
the
christian
slave
trade
represents
one
of
the
most
frightful
and
systematic
brutalities
the
world
has
ever
known
the
contrast
between
the
pagan
and
christian
slavery
is
even
more
marked
when
the
dependence
of
the
christian
slave
upon
the
good
nature
of
his
master
is
considered
compare
this
with
the
decrees
of
the
roman
emperors
masters
were
prohibited
sending
their
slaves
into
the
arena
without
a
judicial
sentence
claudius
punished
as
a
murderer
any
master
who
killed
his
slave
nero
appointed
judges
to
hear
the
complaints
of
slaves
as
to
or
insufficient
feeding
domitian
forbade
the
mutilation
of
slaves
hadrian
forbade
the
selling
of
slaves
to
gladiators
destroyed
private
prisons
for
them
and
ordered
that
they
who
were
proved
to
have
their
slaves
be
forced
to
sell
them
caracalla
forbade
the
selling
of
children
into
slavery
all
that
need
be
added
to
this
is
that
the
later
christian
slavery
represented
a
distinct
retrogression
deliberately
revived
from
motives
of
sheer
cupidity
and
accompanied
by
more
revolting
features
than
the
slavery
of
ancient
times
in
the
history
of
ethics
within
organized
christianity
is
recorded
the
church
as
such
never
contemplated
doing
away
with
slavery
as
such
even
though
stoicism
had
denounced
it
as
mundum
nowhere
does
the
early
church
condemn
slavery
as
an
institution
kindness
to
the
slave
is
frequently
recommended
but
this
was
done
quite
as
forcibly
and
upon
a
much
broader
ground
by
the
pagan
writers
it
would
be
indeed
nearer
the
truth
to
say
that
the
christians
who
wrote
in
favor
of
the
mitigation
of
the
lot
of
the
slave
were
far
more
indebted
to
pagans
than
to
christian
influence
the
church
itself
owned
many
slaves
advised
its
adherents
to
will
their
slaves
to
her
and
was
the
last
to
liberate
the
slaves
which
she
owned
yet
the
apologists
for
the
church
would
have
us
believe
that
she
was
instrumental
in
the
destruction
of
slavery
when
it
is
a
fact
that
there
is
nowhere
a
clear
condemnation
of
slavery
on
the
part
of
the
church
lea
in
his
studies
of
the
church
history
says
the
church
held
many
slaves
and
while
their
treatment
was
in
general
sufficiently
humane
to
cause
the
number
to
grow
by
voluntary
accretions
yet
it
had
no
scruple
to
assert
vigorously
their
claim
to
ownership
when
the
papal
church
granted
a
slave
to
a
monastery
the
dread
anathema
involving
eternal
perdition
was
pronounced
against
anyone
daring
to
interfere
with
the
gift
and
those
who
were
appointed
to
take
charge
of
the
lands
and
farms
of
the
church
were
especially
instructed
that
it
was
part
of
their
duty
to
pursue
and
recapture
fugitive
bondsmen
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
the
catholic
church
was
the
only
ecclesiastical
body
to
condone
slavery
or
that
it
was
only
the
traffic
in
black
slaves
that
flourished
a
few
hundred
years
ago
in
the
seventeenth
century
thousands
of
irish
men
women
and
children
were
seized
by
the
order
or
under
the
license
of
the
english
government
and
sold
as
slaves
for
use
in
the
west
indies
in
the
calendar
of
state
papers
under
various
dates
between
the
following
entries

to
sir
john
clotworthy

a

dealer
named
schlick

for

and
virginia
later
irish
girls
and
a
like
number
of
youths
are
sold
to
the
planters
in
jamaica
had
the
church
been
against
slavery
it
would
have
branded
it
as
a
wrong
and
have
set
the
example
of
liberating
its
own
slaves
it
did
neither
nay
the
church
not
only
held
slaves
itself
not
only
protected
others
who
held
slaves
but
it
thundered
against
all
who
should
despoil
its
property
by
selling
or
liberating
slaves
belonging
to
the
church
the
whole
history
of
the
christian
church
shows
that
it
has
never
felt
itself
called
upon
to
fight
any
sound
institution
no
matter
what
its
character
so
long
as
it
favored
the
church
slavery
and
serfdom
war
piracy
child

have
all
been

in

the
influence
of
christianity
has
been
dominant
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
the
population
of
abyssinia
is
at

ten
million
and
of
this
population
not
less
than
probably
more
are
slaves
in
lady
kathleen
simon
published
her
book
entitled
slavery
dealing
with
the
slave
trade
of
the
world
in
this
work
it
is
pointed
out
that
is
an
integral
part
of
the
religion
of
the
country
and
that
opposition
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
comes
principally
from
the
priesthood
which
considers
itself
the
guardian
of
the
mosaic
law
and
regards
slavery
as
an
institution
ordered
by
jehovah
slave
raids
are
constant
in
this
country
and
are
accompanied
by
the
greatest
brutality
and
cruelty
vast
areas
are
depopulated
by
these
raids
and
even
at
this
date
gangs
of
slaves
may
be
seen
by
travelers
with
the
dead
and
dying
bodies
of
those
that
have
fallen
strewn
along
the
roadside
the
slave
trade
in
abyssinia
is
open
its
horrors
are
well
known
and
it
is
supported
by
the
christian
church
of
the
country
such
is
slavery
in
the
most
christian
country
in
the
world
today
the
country
which
has
the
longest
christian
history
of
any
nation
in
the
world
its
existence
helps
us
to
realize
the
value
of
the
statement
that
the
power
of
christianity
in
the
world
destroyed
the
slave
trade
slavery
flourishes
in
the
oldest
of
christian
countries
in
the
world
backed
up
by
the
church
the
old
bible
and
the
new
testament
it
has
all
the
horrors
all
the
brutalities
all
the
degradations
of
the
slave
trade
at
its
worst
such
is
christian
abyssinia
and
such
but
for
the
saving
grace
of
secular
civilization
would
be
the
rest
of
the
world
the
slave
system
that
arose
in
christian
times
created
by
and
continued
by
christians
in
the
most
christian
of
countries
provides
the
final
and
unanswerable
indictment
of
the
christian
church
slavery
was
unknown
to
the
africans
until
it
was
introduced
by
the
christian
portuguese
in
the
spaniards
began
to
ship
negro
slaves
to
hispaniola
cuba
jamaica
and
porto
rica
john
hawkins
was
the
first
englishman
of
note
to
engage
in
the
traffic
and
queen
elizabeth
loaned
this
virtuous
and
pious
gentleman
the
ship
english
companies
were
licensed
to
engage
in
this
trade
and
during
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
it
was
thrown
open
to
all
between
and
it
has
been
said
that
negroes
were
imported
by
the
company
and
about
more
by
private
traders
between
and
as
many
as
were
transported
to
jamaica
alone
in
the
hundred
years
ending
the
english
carried
into
the
spanish
french
and
english
colonies
three
million
slaves
the
cruelty
experienced
by
these
human
cargoes
on
their
transportation
defies
description
the
chaining
the
branding
the
mutilation
the
close
quarters
the
deaths
by
suffocation
and
disease
are
a
sterling
example
of
man
inhumanity
to
man
when
his
conscience
is
relieved
by
finding
support
of
his
inhumane
actions
sanctioned
in
that
most
holy
of
holies
the
bible
exclusive
of
the
slaves
who
died
before
leaving
africa
not
more
than
fifty
out
of
a
hundred
lived
to
work
on
the
plantations
ingram
history
of
slavery
calculates
that
although
between
and
no
less
than
negroes
had
been
imported
to
jamaica
yet
at
the
latter
date
only
were
on
the
island
slavery
in
america
received
the
same
sanction
by
the
religionists
which
it
received
on
the
continent
george
whitefield
the
great
methodist
preacher
was
an
earnest
supporter
of
slavery
when
the
importation
of
slaves
finally
ceased
the
states
began
the
new
industry
of
breeding
slaves
the
leading
state
for
this
breeding
and
the
one
which
contained
the
largest
number
of
stud
farms
was
virginia
lord
macaulay
in
a
speech
delivered
before
the
house
of
commons
on
february
said
the
slave
states
of
the
union
are
of
two
classes
the
breeding
states
where
the
human
beast
of
burden
increases
and
multiplies
and
becomes
strong
for
labor
and
the
sugar
and
cotton
states
to
which
these
beasts
of
burden
are
sent
to
be
worked
to
death
bad
enough
it
is
that
civilized
man
should
sail
to
an
uncivilized
quarter
of
the
world
where
slavery
existed
should
buy
wretched
barbarians
and
should
carry
them
away
to
labor
in
a
distant
land
bad
enough
but
that
a
civilized
man
a
baptized
man
a
man
proud
of
being
a
citizen
of
a
free
state
a
man
frequenting
a
christian
church
should
breed
slaves
for
exportation
and
if
the
whole
horrible
truth
must
be
told
should
even
beget
slaves
for
exportation
should
see
children
sometimes
his
own
children
gambolling
from
infancy
should
watch
their
growth
should
become
familiar
with
their
faces
and
should
sell
them
for
or
a
head
and
send
them
to
lead
in
a
remote
country
a
life
which
is
a
lingering
death
a
life
about
which
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
is
sure
to
be
short
this
does
i
own
excite
a
horror
exceeding
even
the
horror
excited
by
that
slave
trade
which
is
the
curse
of

between

or
as

it
has
been
estimated
that
the

of

in

owned
no
less
than
slaves
thomas
paine
in
when
he
wrote
his
article
on
justice
and
humanity
was
the
first
to
demand
emancipation
in
a
lucid
manner
the
campaign
for
liberation
of
the
slaves
was
therefore
inaugurated
by
a
freethinker
and
triumphantly
closed
by
another
freethinker
abraham
lincoln
in
this
manner
did
the
church
abolish
slavery
with
characteristic
disregard
for
the
truth
the
religionists
have
laid
claim
to
lincoln
which
claim
has
been
amply
refuted
but
we
are
still
awaiting
the
church
claim
to
paine
as
one
of
her
devotees
and
truly
the
case
against
christianity
is
plain
and
damning
never
during
the
whole
of
its
history
has
it
spoken
in
a
clear
voice
against
slavery
always
as
we
have
seen
its
chief
supporters
have
been
pronounced
believers
they
have
cited
religious
teaching
in
its
defence
they
have
used
all
the
power
of
the
church
for
its
maintenance
naturally
in
a
world
in
which
the
vast
majority
are
professing
christians
believers
are
to
be
found
on
the
side
of
humanity
and
justice
but
to
that
the
reply
is
plain
men
are
human
before
they
are
christians
both
history
and
experience
point
to
the
constant
lesson
of
the
many
cases
in
which
the
claims
of
a
developing
humanity
override
those
of
an
inculcated
religious
teaching
but
the
damning
fact
against
christianity
is
not
that
it
found
slavery
here
when
it
arrived
and
accepted
it
as
a
settled
institution
not
even
that
it
is
plainly
taught
in
its
books
but
that
it
deliberately
created
a
new
form
of
slavery
and
for
hundreds
of
years
invested
it
with
a
brutality
greater
than
that
which
existed
centuries
before
a
religion
which
could
tolerate
this
slavery
argue
for
it
and
fight
for
it
can
not
by
any
stretch
of
reasoning
be
credited
with
an
influence
in
forwarding
emancipation
christianity
no
more
abolished
slavery
than
it
abolished
witchcraft
the
belief
in
demonism
or
punishment
for
heresy
it
was
the
growing
moral
and
social
sense
of
mankind
that
compelled
christians
and
christianity
to
give
up
these
and
other
things

the

the

is
the

why
religion
during
the
middle
ages
the
heads
of
the
church
exercised
all
the
rights
of
a
feudal
lord
and
were
even
more
tenacious
of
their
privileges
the
serfs
were
prohibited
from
migrating
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
the
daughter
of
a
serf
could
not
marry
without
the
consent
of
the
lord
who
frequently
demanded
payment
for
permission
or
worse
still
the
infamous
right
of
the
first
night
the
serf
was
bonded
in
a
hundred
different
ways
and
it
is
significant
of
the
esteem
in
which
the
church
was
held
that
in
every
peasant
revolt
which
occurred
there
was
always
a
direct
attack
on
the
church
professor
thorold
rogers
writing
of
the
twelfth
century
gives
the
following
picture
of
the
poorer
classes
the
houses
of
these
villagers
were
mean
and
dirty
brickmaking
was
a
lost
art
stone
was
found
only
in
a
few
places
the
wood
fire
was
on
a
hob
of
clay
chimneys
were
unknown
except
in
castles
and
manor
houses
and
the
smoke
escaped
through
the
door
or
whatever
other
aperture
it
could
reach
the
floor
of
the
homestead
was
filthy
enough
but
the
surroundings
were
filthier
still
close
by
the
door
stood
the
mixen
a
collection
of
every
abomination
streams
from
which
in
rainy
weather
fertilized
the
lower
meadows
generally
the
lord
pasture
and
polluted
the
stream
the
house
of
the
peasant
cottager
was
poorer
still
most
of
them
were
probably
built
of
posts
wattled
and
plastered
with
clay
or
mud
with
an
upper
storey
of
poles
reached
by
a
ladder
what
the
lord
took
he
held
by
right
of
force
what
the
church
had
it
held
by
force
of
cunning
and
as
in
the
long
run
the
cunning
of
the
church
was
more
powerful
than
the
force
of
the
the
priesthood
grew
in
riches
until
its
wealth
became
a
threat
to
the
whole
of
the
community
in
england
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
clergy
numbered
one
in
of
the
population
and
the
possessions
of
the
church
included
a
third
of
the
land
of
england
no
opportunity
was
lost
by
the
church
to
drain
money
from
the
people
whether
they
were
rich
or
poor
the
trade
done
in
candles
and
sales
of
indulgences
brought
in
large
sums
of
money
and
there
were
continuous
disputes
between
the
clergy
and
the
king
and
the
pope
as
to
the
divisions
of
the
spoil
the
picture
of
the
church
watching
over
the
poor
sheltering
them
from
wrong
tending
them
in
sickness
and
relieving
them
in
their
poverty
will
not
do
it
is
totally
without
historic
foundation
when
the
poor
revolted
and
apart
from
the
great
revolts
there
were
many
small
and
local
outbreaks
the
anger
of
the
poor
was
directed
as
much
against
the
church
as
it
was
against
the
nobles
cohen
christianity
slavery
and
labor
when
the
downtrodden
masses
of
spain
mexico
and
russia
revolted
against
the
tyranny
which
had
held
them
in
the
slough
of
medieval
degradation
they
likewise
in
recent
times
proved
that
they
realized
that
their
submission
was
as
much
caused
by
the
church
allied
as
it
is
with
the
state
as
by
the
government
itself
the
church
did
attend
the
sick
but
its
trade
was
in
the
miracle
cures
and
prayers
and
so
they
very
much
resembled
men
hawking
their
own
goods
and
attending
to
their
own
business
and
there
is
the
plain
historic
fact
that
in
defense
of
its
miracle
cures
it
did
what
it
could
to
obstruct
the
growth
of
both
medical
and
sanitary
science
it
did
give
alms
but
these
constituted
but
a
small
part
of
what
it
had
previously
taken
through
all
the
changes
of
the
sixteenth
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
it
is
impossible
to
detect
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
churches
roman
catholic
or
protestant
to
better
the
status
of
or
improve
the
condition
of
the
working
classes
whatever
improvements
may
have
come
about
and
they
were
few
enough
came
independently
of
christianity
organized
or
unorganized
controversies
about
religious
matters
might
and
did
grow
more
acute
controversies
about
bettering
the
position
of
the
working
classes
only
began
with
the
breaking
down
of
christianity
and
when
as
in
germany
there
occurred
a
revolt
and
the
peasants
appealed
to
luther
for
assistance
he
wrote
after
exhorting
the
peasants
to
resignation
to
the
nobles
a
rebel
is
outlawed
of
god
and
kaiser
therefore
who
can
and
will
first
slaughter
such
a
man
does
right
well
since
upon
such
a
common
rebel
every
man
is
alike
the
judge
and
executioner
therefore
who
can
shall
openly
or
secretly
smite
slaughter
and
stab
and
hold
that
there
is
nothing
more
poisonous
more
harmful
more
devilish
than
a
rebellious
man
and
in
france
the
church
saw
unmoved
a
state
of
affairs
almost
unimaginable
so
far
as
the
masses
of
the
people
were
concerned
in
their
misery
and
demoralization
and
this
at
a
time
when
half
the
land
of
france
in
addition
to
palaces
chateaux
and
other
forms
of
wealth
were
possessed
by
the
nobility
and
clergy
and
were
practically
free
from
taxation
a
contemporary
observer
writes
certain
beings
male
and
female
are
seen
in
the
country
black
livid
and
sunburnt
and
belonging
to
the
soil
which
they
dig
and
grub
with
invincible
stubbornness
they
stand
erect
they
display
human
lineaments
and
seem
capable
of
articulation
they
are
in
fact
men
they
retire
at
night
into
their
dens
where
they
live
on
black
bread
water
and
roots
they
spare
other
human
beings
the
trouble
of
sowing
in
france
the
clergy
counting
monks
and
nuns
numbered
in
over
with
total
possessions
estimated
at
two
thousand
million
pounds
producing
an
annual
revenue
of
about
one
hundred
and
forty
millions
the
clergy
were
free
from
taxation
and
the
higher
members
of
the
order
possessed
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
feudal
nobility
to
the
end
the
church
in
france
as
in
our
day
in
russia
remained
the
champion
of
privilege
and
misgovernment
in
england
during
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
developed
the
english
manufacturing
system
were
common
in
both
mines
and
factories
the
regular
working
hours
were
from
to
with
six
full
days
labor
per
week
one
investigator
remarks
it
is
a
very
common
practice
with
the
great
populous
parishes
in
london
to
bind
children
in
large
numbers
to
the
proprietors
of
in
lancashire
and
yorkshire
at
a
distance
of
miles
the
children
are
sent
off
by
waggon
loads
at
a
time
and
are
as
much
lost
for
ever
to
their
parents
as
if
they
were
shipped
off
for
the
west
indies
the
parishes
that
bind
them
by
procuring
a
settlement
for
the
children
at
the
end
of
forty
days
get
rid
of
them
for
ever
and
the
poor
children
have
not
a
human
being
in
the
world
to
whom
they
can
look
up
for
redress
against
the
wrongs
they
may
be
exposed
to
from
these
wholesale
dealers
in
them
whose
object
it
is
to
get
everything
they
can
possibly
wring
from
their
excessive
labor
and
fatigue
in
the
mines
conditions
were
still
worse
and
a
report
in
states
children
are
taken
at
the
earliest
ages
if
only
to
be
used
as
living
and
waving
candlesticks
or
to
keep
rats
from
a
dinner
and
it
is
in
pits
of
the
worst
character
too
in
which
most
female
children
are
employed
it
would
appear
from
the
practical
returns
obtained
by
the
commissioner
that
about
of
the
persons
employed
in
coal
mines
are
under
eighteen
years
of
age
and
that
much
more
than
of
this
proportion
are
under
thirteen
years
of
age
in
certain
mines
there
was
no
distinction
of
sex
so
far
as
underground
labor
was
concerned
the
men
worked
entirely
naked
and
were
assisted
by
females
of
all
ages
from
girls
of
six
years
to
women
of
who
were
quite
naked
down
to
the
waist
but
if
oppression
was
rife
education
at
a
low
ebb
and
misery
prevalent
the
religion
of
the
people
was
receiving
attention
the
period
was
in
fact
one
of
revival
in
religion
the
wesleyan
revival
was
in
full
swing
and
evangelical
christianity
was
making
great
advances
between
and
there
were
founded
the
british
and
foreign
bible
society
the
london
missionary
society
and
the
mission
to
the
jews
when
the
education
bill
of
came
before
the
house
of
lords
out
of
eighteen
bishops
who
voted
on
the
measure
fifteen
voted
against
it
thus
the
religionists
were
most
active
during
the
period
when
a
condition
approximating
white
slavery
existed
and
why
should
this
not
have
been
so
when
the
church
is
not
interested
in
the
social
and
economic
status
of
its
adherents
during
their
existence
on
this
planet
but
is
avowedly
concerned
with
deluding
its
devotees
into
a
mythical
belief
in
a
life
hereafter
the
greatest
number
of
slaves
and
the
greatest
degradation
of
workers
is
to
be
found
in
those
times
and
places
where
religious
superstition
is
most
powerful
in
our
own
country
as
well
as
in
england
the
labor
movement
has
developed
not
merely
outside
the
range
of
organized
christianity
but
in
the
teeth
of
the
bitterest
opposition
to
it
christianity
since
it
came
into
power
has
always
preached
to
the
poor
in
defense
of
the
privileges
and
possessions
of
the
rich
in
a
recent
publication
by
jerome
davis
which
is
entitled
labor
speaks
for
itself
on
religion
the
author
has
compiled
the
opinions
of
labor
leaders
in
the
united
states
canada
great
britain
russia
germany
czechoslovakia
mexico
china
austria
australia
belgium
and
japan
it
is
a
terrific
indictment
by
labor
against
organized
religion
the
author
tells
us
here
is
labor
speaking
for
itself
and
in
the
by
and
large
it
feels
that
the
church
has
not
understood
or
helped
it
to
secure
justice
the
majority
believe
that
the
church
has
a
capitalistic
bias
it
is
a
class
institution
for
the
upper
and
middle
classes
this
is
putting
the
matter
rather
mildly
when
one
considers
their
grievances
expressed
in
their
own
words
again
jerome
davis
asks
is
it
possible
that
our
church
leaders
are
to
some
extent
blinded
by
current
conventional
standards
are
they
so
busy
sharing
the
wealth
of
the
prosperous
with
others
in
spiritual
quests
that
they
fail
to
see
some
areas
of
desperate
social
need
do
they
to
some
degree
unconsciously
exchange
the
gift
of
prophecy
for
yearly
budgets
and
business
boards
james

the

of

pennsylvania

of

and
the
title
of
his
subject
is
has
the
church
betrayed
labor
maurer
opinion
follows
a
worker
living
from
hand
to
mouth
and
lucky
if
he
is
not
hopelessly
in
debt
besides
working
at
speed
when
he
has
work
with
no
security
against
enforced
idleness
sickness
and
old
age
can
hardly
be
expected
to
become
deeply
interested
in
or
a
very
enthusiastic
listener
to
sermons
about
lot
disobedient
wife
who
because
she
looked
back
was
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
he
is
far
more
concerned
about
his
own
overworked
and
perhaps
underfed
wife
who
due
to
the
strain
of
trying
to
raise
his
family
on
a
meager
income
that
permits
of
no
rest
or
proper
medical
care
is
slowly
but
surely
turning
into
a
corpse
to
go
to
a
church
and
listen
to
a
sermon
about
the
sublimeness
of
being
humble
and
meek
that
no
matter
how
desperate
the
struggle
to
live
may
be
one
should
be
contented
and
not
envy
the
more
fortunate
because
god
in
his
infinite
wisdom
has
ordained
that
there
shall
be
rich
and
poor
and
that
no
matter
how
heavy
one
burdens
on
this
earth
one
should
bear
them
meekly
and
look
for
reward
in
the
world
to
come
and
remember
that
god
loves
the
poor
such
sermons
naturally
sound
pleasing
to
the
ears
of
the
wealthy
listeners
and
the
usual
reward
is
a
shower
of
gold
and
hearty
congratulations
by
the
sleek
and
members
of
the
congregation
but
to
an
intelligent
worker
such
sermons
sound
like
capitalistic
propaganda
upon
which
he
is
constantly
being
fed
by
every
concern
in
the
country
and
quite
naturally
he
tries
to
avoid
getting
an
extra
dose
of
the
same
kind
of
buncombe
on
sunday
in
churches
men
have
listened
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
to
lessons
and
sermons
about
brotherhood
of

of
swords
of
war
into
plowshares
of
peace
is
his
brother
helper
on

good
will
toward
men
shalt
not

we
are
taught
to
say
the
lord
prayer
and
ask
for
heaven
on
earth
and
yet
at
every
war
opportunity
with
a
very
few
noble
exceptions
the
church
at
the
command
of
the
war
lords
has
scrapped
its
peace
sentiments
and
turned
its
back
to
the
prince
of
peace
and
heaven
on
earth
and
has
shouted
itself
hoarse
for
hell
on
earth
and
then
the
spokesmen
of
the
churches
of
each
nation
at
war
have
had
the
impudence
to
pray
to
a
just
god
and
ask
him
to
play
favorites
to
use
his
infinite
power
on
their
side
and
join
in
the
mad
slaughter
of
his
own
beloved
children
and
those
slaughtered
are
the
workers
and
their
folks
at
home
naturally
wonder
why
the
one

international

out

to

he
concludes
by
citing
this
occurrence
for
a
good
illustration
of
what
the
church
is
sometimes
guilty
of
let
us
take
a
glimpse
at
what
happened
in
detroit
during
the
month
of
october
when
the
american
federation
of
labor
was
holding
its
annual
convention
there
nearly
every
church
in
detroit
sent
invitations
to
prominent
labor
officials
to
speak
in
their
churches
before
bible
classes
sunday
schools
and
young
men
christian
associations
most
of
the
invitations
were
accepted
by
the
labor
officials
including
president
green
of
the
of
as
soon
as
the
big
employers
learned
about
the
program
they
not
only
frowned
upon
the
idea
of
allowing
their
sacred
temples
to
be
contaminated
with
representatives
of
the
working
class
but
put
both
feet
down
as
hard
as
they
could
on
the
proposition
did
the
clergymen
stand
firm
when
men
with
dollars
talked
to
their
everlasting
shame
they
did
not
percent
of
them
bowed
to
the
will
of
mammon
and
the
representatives
of
labor
were
barred
from
the
sacred
temples
erected
in
the
name
of
god
and
the
lowly
nazarene
proving
conclusively
to
the
minds
of
the
average
citizen
who
controls
the
churches
and
whom
they
serve
small
wonder
that
many
workers
have
a
poor
opinion
of
the
church
and
that
so
many
pews
are
empty
j
hardman
the
editor
of
the
official
journal
of
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
gives
us
his
opinion
regarding
the
religion
of
labor
it
lulls
the
social
underdog
with
a
sham
consolation
for
the
oppression
and
exploitation
which
are
his
lot
and
furnishes
the
exploiter
and
oppressor
with
graceful
distraction
and
absolution
from
his
daily
practice
and
meanness
this
is
the
actual
basis
of
church
activity
the
religion
of
labor
is
godless
for
it
seeks
to
restore
the
divinity
of
man
james
thompson
the
national
organizer
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
heads
his
article
for
jerome
davis
religion
is
the
negation
of
the
truth
and
in
his
militant
manner
proclaims
this
organization
designed
to
praise
god
and
help
him
run
the
universe
is
known
as
the
church
the
established
church
has
always
been
on
the
side
of
the
rich
and
powerful
its
robed
representatives
pretending
to
be
godlike
and
favorites
of
god
having
special
influence
with
him
have
ever
functioned
as
the
moral
police
agents
of
the
ruling
classes
at
one
time
or
another
they
have
asked
god
to
bless
nearly
everything
from
the
slave
driver
lash
to
murderous
wars
thus
they
strive
to
extend
the
blessings
of
god
to
the
infamies
of
men
under
capitalism
they
teach
the
working
class
the
doctrine
of
humility
tell
them
that
if
they
get
a
slap
on
one
cheek
to
turn
the
other
and
are
the
poor
they
tell
us
to
bear
the
cross
and
wear
the
crown
that
we
will
get
back
in
the
next
world
what
is
stolen
from
us
in
this
in
other
words
they
try
to
chloroform
us
with
stories
of
heaven
while
the
robbers
plunder
the
world
for
this
support
the
ruling
classes
donate
liberally
to
the
church
the
organized
robbers
and
organized
beggars
support
each
other
james
noonan
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
asks
a
pertinent
question
labor
observes
an
increasing
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
church
to
regulate
what
man
may
eat
drink
or
smoke
where
and
how
he
shall
spend
his
sundays
the
character
and
kind
of
amusements
he
may
participate
in
and
various
other
activities
many
of
which
seem
more
or
less
trivial
all
of
which
leads
the
average
worker
to
ponder
rather
seriously
just
why
it
is
that
the
church
can
vigorously
advocate
and
promote
legislation
seeking
to
curtail
his
liberty
to
enjoy
in
his
own
way
the
limited
number
of
leisure
hours
at
his
disposal
and
yet
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
cry
of
tortured
men
women
and
children
for
relief
from
the
curse
of
low
wages
long
hours
and
scores
of
other
industrial
conditions
and
abuses
which
inevitably
pave
the
way
for
numberless
cases
of
moral
turpitude
james
woodsworth
a
former
minister
speaking
for
the
canadian
labor
party
exclaims
the

a

james
simpson
secretary
of
the
canadian
labor
party
makes
this
statement
i
found
that
the
conditions
which
called
for
radical
change
if
the
social
and
economic
security
of
the
people
was
going
to
be
established
did
not
concern
the
church
as
an
institution
it
was
concerned
in
establishing
an
outlook
upon
life
that
would
induce
men
to
do
the
right
but
if
the
right
was
not
done
there
was
very
little
distinction
drawn
between
the
and
the
this
lack
of
distinction
did
not
apply
so
much
to
what
were
as
moral
indiscretions
as
it
did
to
the
larger
failures
to
recognize
relationship
to
man
in
the
industrial
and
commercial
activities
of
life
labor
thinks
the
church
is
insincere
it
is
an
exceptional
case
for
a
minister
to
take
a
stand
on
the
side
of
the
workers
even
when
the
issue
between
the
employers
and
employees
is
a
clear
case
of
the
former
trying
to
enforce
conditions
upon
the
latter
which
are
unfair
and
inhuman
fenner
brockway
the
political
secretary
of
the
independent
labor
party
in
england
writes
in
this
manner
the
hymns
of
the
church
are
obsolete
the
sermons
are
very
rarely
worth
listening
to
the
forms
of
worship
are
unrelated
to
life
and
such
inspiration
as
comes
from
the
devotion
and
beauty
of
some
church
services
and
buildings
can
be
found
ever
more
intimately
and
fully
in
the
silences
and
beauty
of
nature
george
lansbury
is
another
englishman
speaking
for

labor
and
he
tells
us
that
ordinary
working
people
in
britain
think
very
little
about
churches
or
about
religion
years
ago
i
was
asked
people
accept
religion
why
do
the
masses
go
to

then

arthur
crispien
president
of
the
german
social
democratic
party
gives
us
his
opinion
men
should
not
look
upon
this
earth
as
a
vale
of
tears
and
fly
from
rude
realities
to
a
world
of
phantasms
they
should
embrace
the
beauties
of
the
world
and
realize
and
fulfill
their
social
rights
and
duties
our
work
lies
in
this
world
as
to
the
other
each
is
at

to
decide
according
to
his
needs
karl
mennicke
another
former
minister
points
out
the
attitude
of
german
labor
for
modern
labor
the
feeling
that
human
life
is
first
of
all
a
matter
of
eternal
life
and
only
secondarily
a
matter
of
this
world
has
been
entirely
lost
the
eschatologic
mood
or
expectation
of
jesus
has
no
sounding
board
in
the
masses
of
the
proletariat
of
the
christian
epoch
in
history
is
obviously
on
its
way
to
extinction
the
eschatological
mood
of
christianity
has
been
a
handicap
and
still
is
for
the
christian
community
has
difficulty
finding
an
organic
relationship
to
the
creative
problems
of
social
life
emanuel
radl
speaks
of
labor
and
the
church
in
czechoslovakia
in
general
the
churches
play
a
far
lesser
part
in
our
public
life
than
in
the
united
states
people
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
churches
as
exploded
institutions
that
are
factors
only
among
the
uneducated
classes
the
churches
are
not
measuring
up
in
understanding
and
helping
the
poor
robert
haberman
representing
the
mexican
labor
party
gives
a
summation
of
the
tyranny
that
the
clergy
of
that
country
yoked
upon
the
masses
and
the
retardation
that
it
has
produced
it
furnishes
striking
and
conclusive
evidence
of
the
harm
that
is
done
when
the
church
and
state
are
still
integrally
intertwined
there
is
no
better
example
of
the
efforts
of
a
reactionary
clergy
to
keep
the
masses
in
poverty
and
ignorance
than
is
this
study
of
the
church
in
modern
mexico
haberman
gives
an
account
of
the
church
activities
in
old
mexico
and
coming
to
the
present
by
the
year
the
church
had
gained
possession
of
about
of
all
the
lands
of
mexico
almost
every
bank
and
every
large
business
the
rest
of
the
country
was
mortgaged
to
the
church
then
came
the
revolution
of
led
by
benito
juarez
it
culminated
in
the
constitution
of
which
secularized
the
schools
and
confiscated
church
property
all
the
churches
were
nationalized
many
of
them
were
turned
into
schools
hospitals
and
orphan
asylums
civil
marriages
were
made
obligatory
pope
pius
ix
immediately
issued
a
mandate
against
the
constitution
and
called
upon
all
catholics
of
mexico
to
disobey
it
ever
since
then
the
clergy
has
been
fighting
to
regain
its
lost
temporal
power
and
wealth
it
has
been
responsible
for
civil
wars
and
for
foreign
intervention
under
the
rule
of
diaz
the
constitution
was
disregarded
and
the
church
was
permitted
to
regain
most
of
its
lost
privileges
the
church
bells
rang
out
at
sunrise
to
call
the
peons
out
with
nothing
more
to
eat
than
some
tortillas
and
chili
to
work
all
day
long
in
the
burning
fields
until
sunset
when
the
church
bells
rang
again
to
send
them
home
to
their
mud
huts
during
their
work
they
were
beaten
on
sundays
they
were
lashed
and
sent
bleeding
to
mass
after
church
they
had
to
do
faenas
free
work
for
the
church
in
the
name
of
some
saint
or
other
either
to
build
a
new
church
or
do
some
special
work
for
the
priests
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
after
the
revolution
against
diaz
in
many
places
as
soon
as
the
peons
were
told
they
were
free
their
first
act
was
to
climb
up
the
church
steeples
and
smash
the
bells
after
that
they
rushed
inside
the
churches
and
destroyed
the
statues
and
paintings
of
the
saints
during
the
whole
period
of
havoc
and
exploitation
was
the
voice
of
the
church
heard
in
behalf
of
the
downtrodden
illiteracy
amounted
to
percent
but
the
church
helped
the
further
enslavement
of
the
workers
there
was
not
a
church
ceremony
birth
marriage
or
death
that
did
not
cost
money
the
worker
had
to
borrow
for
each
and
the
more
he
borrowed
the
more
closely
he
riveted
upon
himself
the
chains
of
peonage
the
present
conflict
started
in
february
when
archbishop
jose
mora
del
rio
head
of
the
church
in
mexico
issued
a
statement
in
the
press
declaring
war
against
the
constitution
gideon
chen
speaking
for
chinese
labor
asserts
the
christian
church
in
china
brought
up
in
a
western
greenhouse
with
all
its
achievements
and
shortcomings
does
not
speak
a
language
intelligible
to
the
labor
world
karl
kautsky
the
austrian
representative
of
labor
takes
the
attitude
that
the
less
labor
as
a
whole
has
to
do
with
church
questions
and
the
less
it
is
interested
in
the
churches
the
more
successful
will
be
its
strife
for
emancipation
otto
bauer
another
representative
of
austrian
labor
makes
the
assertion
capitalism
forces
the
worker
into
the
class
struggle
in
this
class
struggle
he
comes
across
the
clergy
and
finds
it
the
champion
of
his
class
adversary
the
worker
transfers
his
hate
from
the
clergyman
to
religion
itself
in
whose
name
this
clergyman
is
defending
the
social
order
of
the
middle
classes
in
austria
the
bourgeois
parties
take
advantage
of
the
belief
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
proletarians
in
a
lord
in
heaven
to
keep
them
in
subjection
to
their
earthly
masters
ernest
barker
the
general
secretary
of
the
australian
labor
party
holds
forth
in
an
article
entitled
the
church
is
weighed
and
found
wanting
he
is
quite
emphatic
in
his
statements
the
attitude
of
the
labor
movement
in
australia
to
the
church
is
one
of
supreme
indifference
there
is
little
or
no
point
of
contact
between
the
two
and
apparently
neither
considers
the
other
in
its
activities
and
plan
of
campaign
the
church
preaches
the
brotherhood
of
man
what
brotherhood
can
exist
between
the
wealthy
receiver
of
interest
profit
and
rent
and
the
struggling
worker
who
sees
his
wife
dragged
down
by
poverty
and
overwork
and
his
children
stunted
and
dwarfed
physically
and
intellectually
between
the
underworked
and
overfed
commercial
or
industrial
magnate
and
the
underfed
overworked
denizen
of
the
slums
the
church
is
put
on
trial
in
the
minds
of
men
they
ask
did
the
church
do
when
we
sought
a
living
wage
shorter
hours
of
work
safer
working
conditions
abolition
of
sunday
work
abolition
of
child
labor
the
answer
is
an
almost
entirely
negative
one
the
few
instances
when
church
officials
have
helped
are
so
conspicuous
as
to
emphasize
the
general
aloofness
in
how
many
of
the
advanced
ideas
of
our
time
has
the
church
taken
the
lead
is
it
not
renowned
for
being
a
long
way
in
the
rear
rather
than
in
the
vanguard
of
progressive
thought
and
action
it
resents
any
challenge
to
its
ideas
doctrines
or
authority
emile
vandervelde
the
leader
of
the
belgian
labor
party
discusses
the
personal
religious
convictions
of
the
labor
leaders
in
france
and
belgium
today
as
yesterday
the
immense
majority
are
atheists
materialists
or
at
least
agnostics
to
whom
it
would
never
occur
to
profess
any
creed
no
matter
how
liberal
it
might
be
toyohiko
kogawa
the
secretary
of
the
japan
labor
federation
says
labor
considers
the
church
too
it
thinks
it
has
no
concern
with
the
interests
of
labor
and
that
the
church
has
lost
her
aim
in
this
world
and
is
looking
up
only
into
heaven
and
labor
forgets
where
to
go
loses
its
sense
of
direction
so
labor
stops
thinking
about
religion
and
religion
stops
thinking
about
industry
the
church
has
no
principle
of
economics
and
labor
has
no
religious
aspiration
the
opinions
of
these
men
who
are
daily
in
contact
with
the
problem
of
social
justice
the
world
over
surely
furnish
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
regarding
both
the
unconcern
of
religion
upon
the
furtherance
of
social
justice
and
its
actual
negative
and
harmful
influence
the
devout
sherwood
eddy
a
sincere
and
noble
exponent
of
social
justice
is
forced
to
exclaim
but
i
saw
that
there
would
be
much
more
opposition
from
professing
christians
if
i
preached
a
gospel
of
social
justice
than
ever
there
had
been
from
so
called
nations
in
calling
them
to
turn
from
their
idols
indeed
mammon
is
a
much
more
potent
idol
it
is
more
cruel
smeared
with
more
human
blood
than
kali
of
siva
they
sacrifice
goats
to
kali
and
we
shudder
we
sacrifice
men
to
mammon
and
justify
our
in
simple
fact
though
they
are
not
worthy
of
mention
i
have
met
with
more
opposition
and
misrepresentation
ten
times
over
in
america
than
i
ever
met
in
fifteen
years
in
india
or
in
repeated
visits
to
china
turkey
or
russia
eddy
religion
and
social
justice
religious
philosophy
is
slave
philosophy
it
teaches
of
a
god
who
is
personally
interested
in
the
individual
and
who
will
reward
present
misery
with
future
bliss
the
demoralizing
effect
of
this
infamous
fraud
is
apparent
everywhere
if
a
worker
is
constantly
assailed
with
this
nonsense
from
the
pulpit
the
result
is
the
production
in
him
of
a
mental
as
well
as
a
physical
slavery
it
aggravates
his
mental
inertia
and
the
force
of

achieving
its
effects
he
soon
resigns
himself
to
his
present
miserable
state
drugged
with
the
delusion
of
a
better
life
in
the
hereafter
he
believes
that
his
destiny
is

that

will
be
rewarded
in

for

on
earth
what
a
marvelous
opiate
the
ecclesiastics
have
been
injecting
into
the
minds
of
the
masses
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
capital
has
aided
throughout
the
ages
and
has
stood
by
religion
the
irony
of
the
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
slave
will
fight
so
valiantly
for
his
tyrannical
master
that
the
unscrupulous
few
who
derive
all
the
benefits
can
like
a
malignant
parasite
suck
the
of
its
victims
while
their
still
living
prey
submits
without
a
struggle
the
worker
inebriated
with
his
religious
delusion
calmly
allows
his
very
substance
to
be
the
means
through
which
his
parasitic
employer
grows
fat
that
was
the
net
result
of
christianity
and
of
the
activity
of
the
christian
church
in
spreading
abroad
a
spirit
of
kindliness
humanity
and
brotherhood
the
coquetry
of
christianity
with
labor
within
the
last
generation
or
two
is
only
what
one
would
expect
but
it
is
clear
that
the
one
constant
function
of
christianity
has
been
to
encourage
loyalty
to
existing
institutions
no
matter
what
their
character
so
long
as
they
were
not
unfriendly
to
the
church
slavery
and
the
oppression
of

continued
while
christianity
was
at
its
strongest
and
wealthiest
its
own
wealth
derived
from
the
oppression
it
encouraged
slavery
died
out
when
social
and
economic
conditions
rendered
its
continuance
more
and
more
difficult
and
the
conditions
of
labor
improved
when
men
ceased
to
talk
of
a
order
of
decree
and
dismissed
the
evangelical
narcotic
served
out
by
the

and
began
to
realize
that

were
the

elizabeth
cady
stanton
it
is
noticed
in
most
calculations
of
churchgoers
that
women
have
remained
attached
to
the
churches
in
a
far
higher
proportion
than
men
the
proportion
of
women
in
the
churches
is
vastly
greater
than
their
proportion
in
the
general
population
most
of
the
men
who
still
passively
attend
their
churches
do
so
under
the
pressure
of
professional
interest
or
social
or
domestic
influence
the
degree
of
religiosity
has
always
been
associated
with
the
free
play
of
the
emotions
and
woman
being
more
imaginative
and
emotional
than
man
it
seems
clear
that
this
strong
emotional
factor
in
woman
accounts
at
least
partly
for
the
greater
proportion
of
women
as
churchgoers
and
this
be
it
noted
lies
not
in
any
inherent
inferiority
in
the
mental
of
woman
but
rather
in
the
environmental
influences
that
until
very
recently
shaped
woman
education
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
little
adapted
to
strengthening
her
reason
but
rather
calculated
to
enhance
her
emotionalism
ecclesiastic
historians
have
a
notorious
habit
of
viewing
times
for
the
single
biased
purpose
of
only
stating
the
aspects
of
that
civilization
which
they
deemed
inferior
to
that
exerted
by
christianity
researches
have
established
fairly
well
the
position
of
women
in
the
egyptian
community
of
years
ago
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
she
was
free
and
more
honored
in
egypt
years
ago
than
she
was
in
any
country
of
the
earth
until
only
recently
scholars
assure
us
that
at
a
period
which
the
bible
claims
the
earth
was
just
coming
into
being
the
egyptian
matron
was
mistress
of
her
home
she
inherited
equally
with
her
brothers
and
had
full
control
of
her
property
she
could
go
where
she
liked
and
speak
to
whom
she
pleased
she
could
bring
actions
in
the
courts
and
even
plead
in
the
courts
the
traditional
advice
to
the
husband
was
make
glad
her
heart
during
the
time
that
thou
hast
contrast
this
position
of
woman
in
the
community
and
society
in
general
with
the
statement
given
in
cady
stanton
history
of
suffrage
in
which
she
speaks
of
the
status
of
the
female
of
the
species
in
boston
about
the
year
women
could
not
hold
any
property
either
earned
or
inherited
if
unmarried
she
was
obliged
to
place
it
in
the
hands
of
a
trustee
to
whose
will
she
was
subject
if
she
contemplated
marriage
and
desired
to
call
her
property
her
own
she
was
forced
by
law
to
make
a
contract
with
her
intended
husband
by
which
she
gave
up
all
title
or
claim
to
it
a
woman
either
married
or
unmarried
could
hold
no
office
or
trust
or
power
she
was
not
a
person
she
was
not
recognized
as
a
citizen
she
was
not
a
factor
in
the
human
family
she
was
not
a
unit
but
a
zero
in
the
sum
of
civilization
the
status
of
a
married
woman
was
little
better
than
that
of
a
domestic
servant
by
the
english
common
law
her
husband
was
her
lord
and
master
he
had
the
sole
custody
of
her
person
and
of
her
minor
children
he
could
punish
her
a
stick
no
bigger
than
his
thumb
and
she
could
not
complain
against
him
the
common
law
of
the
state
massachusetts
held
man
and
wife
to
be
one
person
but
that
person
was
the
husband
he
could
by
will
deprive
her
of
every
part
of
his
property
and
also
of
what
had
been
her
own
before
marriage
he
was
the
owner
of
all
her
real
estate
and
earnings
the
wife
could
make
no
contract
and
no
will
nor
without
her
husband
consent
dispose
of
the
legal
interest
of
her
real
estate
she
did
not
own
a
rag
of
her
clothing
she
had
no
personal
rights
and
could
hardly
call
her
soul
her
own
her
husband
could
steal
her
children
rob
her
of
her
clothing
neglect
to
support
the
family
she
had
no
legal
redress
if
a
wife
earned
money
by
her
own
labor
the
husband
could
claim
the
pay
as
his
share
of
the
proceeds
with
such
a
contrast
in
mind
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
see
where
the
truth
of
the
assertion
lies
when
it
is
stated
that
the
status
of
woman
was
indeed
pitiful
until
christianity
exerted
its
influence
for
her
betterment
and
it
is
again
curious
to
note
that
after
a
period
of
nearly
years
of
christian
influence
it
was
left
for
a
sceptic
such
as
stanton
and
her
sceptical
to
bring
about
an
amelioration
of
the
degrading
position
of
woman
in
christian
society
the
degrading
picture
of
womankind
as
depicted
in
the
old
testament
is
well
known
to
anyone
who
has
glanced
through
this
storehouse
of
mythology
it
would
be
well
for
the
multitude
of
devout
female
adherents
of
all
creeds
to
take
the
time
just
a
little
of
the
time
they
give
to
the
plight
of
the
poor
benighted
heathen
and
read
some
of
the
passages
in
the
old
testament
dealing
with
their
lot
the
entire
history
of
woman
under
the
administration
of
these
laws
is
a
record
of
her
serviture
and
humility
in
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
we
find
the
right
of
divorce
given
to
the
husband
let
him
write
her
a
bill
of
divorcement
and
give
it
in
her
hand
and
send
her
out
of
his
house
the
discarded
wife
must
acquiesce
to
divine
justice
but
if
the
wife
is
displeased
is
there
any
justice
under
no
clause
of
the
divorce
law
could
the
wife
have
a
divorce
on
her
part
none
but
the
husband
could
put
her
asunder
from
him
in
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
is
enacted
the
law
for
test
of
virginity
which
states
that
if
any
man
take
a
wife
and
is
disappointed
in
her
and
reports
found
her
not
a
maid
then
her
father
and
mother
shall
bring
forth
the
tokens
of
the
damsel
virginity
unto
the
elders
of
the
city
in
the
gate
the
gynecological
elders
then
go
into
a
peeping
tom
conference
and
if
virginity
be
not
found
for
the
damsel
then
they
shall
bring
out
the
damsel
to
the
door
of
her
father
house
and
the
men
of
the
city
shall
stone
her
with
stones
that
she
die
most
probably
the
male
partner
in
her
crime
was
the
first
to
cast
the
largest
stone
the
law
laid
down
in
the
chapter
of
leviticus
may
have
been
intended
for
hygienic
purposes
but
it
is
cruel
and
degrading
to
women
because
it
assumes
that
the
parturient
woman
who
has
borne
a
female
child
is
twice
as
impure
as
one
who
has
borne
a
male
child
the
law
of
jealousies
as
described
in
the
chapter
of
numbers
is
a
good
example
of
the
mentality
of
the
writers
of
this
divine
revelation
god
in
his
infinite
wisdom
had
caused
to
be
written
for
him
that
to
test
whether
a
woman
has
laid
carnally
with
another
man
the
priest
shall
take
holy
water
in
an
earthen
vessel
and
of
the
dust
that
is
on
the
floor
of
the
tabernacle
the
priest
shall
take
and
put
it
in
the
water
the
bitter
water
that
causeth
the
curse
and
shall
cause
the
woman
to
drink
the
water
the
divine
revelation
then
continues
with
if
she
be
defiled
her
belly
shall
swell
and
her
thigh
shall
rot
but
after
all
god
did
not
know
that
in
the
dust
of
the
tabernacle
sprawled
the
germs
of
dysentery
cholera
and
tuberculosis
and
a
few
other
such
mild
infections
or
did
the
divine
father
know
that
even
a
germ
could
not
inhabit
the
filthy
floor
of
the
tabernacle
consequently
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
in
the
good
old
days
of
the
woman
the
acme
of
hospitality
was
the
giving
of
wife
or
daughter
to
a
visitor
for
the
night
it
was
not
religion
that
put
an
end
to
this
barbarous
custom
it
was
the
advance
of
civilization
not
the
religious
force
but
the
place
rational
thinking
assumed
in
the
life
of
people
the
following
is
a
description
of
a
religious
riot
which
took
place
in
alexandria
during
the
early
days
of
the
church
among
the
many
victims
of
these
unhappy
tumults
was
hypatia
a
maiden
not
more
distinguished
for
her
beauty
than
for
her
learning
and
her
virtues
her
father
was
theon
the
illustrious
mathematician
who
had
early
initiated
his
daughter
in
the
mysteries
of
philosophy
the
classic
groves
of
athens
and
the
schools
of
alexandria
equally
applauded
her
attainments
and
listened
to
the
pure
music
of
her
lips
she
respectfully
declined
the
tender
attentions
of
lovers
but
raised
to
the
chair
of
gamaliel
suffered
youth
and
age
without
preference
or
favor
to
sit
indiscriminately
at
her
feet
her
fame
and
increasing
popularity
ultimately
excited
the
jealousy
of
cyril
at
that
time
the
bishop
of
alexandria
and
her
friendship
for
his
antagonist
orestes
the
prefect
of
the
city
entailed
on
her
devoted
head
the
crushing
weight
of
his
enmity
in
her
way
through
the
city
her
chariot
was
surrounded
by
his
creatures
headed
by
a
crafty
and
savage
fanatic
named
peter
the
reader
and
the
young
and
innocent
woman
was
dragged
to
the
ground
stripped
of
her
garments
paraded
naked
through
the
streets
and
then
torn
limb
from
limb
on
the
steps
of
the
cathedral
the
still
warm
flesh
was
scraped
from
her
bones
with
and
the
bleeding
fragments
thrown
into
a
furnace
so
that
not
an
atom
of
the
beautiful
virgin
should
escape
destruction
the
cruelty
of
man
when
spurred
on
by
the
mania
of
religious
zeal
in
more
historic
times
there
are
numerous
instances
of
the
tyranny
exercised
over
women
by
the
feudal
system
feudalism
composed
as
it
was
of
military
ideas
and
ecclesiastical
traditions
exercised
the
well
known
rights
of
seigniory
these
rights
comprised
a
jurisdiction
which
is
now
unprintable
and
had
even
the
power
to
deprive
woman
of
life
itself
a
history
of
the
licentiousness
of
the
monks
and
the
early
popes
would
fill
a
great
number
of
volumes
and
indeed
many
are
the
volumes
which
have
been
devoted
to
this
subject
it
will
suffice
to
point
out
only
a
few
representative
incidents
in
alexander

the
shameful
union
between

successful
in
reducing
such
powerful
enemies
as
the
archbishop
of
cologne
and
the

by
fire
and

was
powerless
against
the
dissolute
morals
of
his
own
monks
who
were
chiefly
engaged
in
the
corruption
of
women
indeed
the
swiss
clergy
in
frankly
stated
that
they
were
flesh
and
blood
unequal
to
the
task
of
living
like
angels
the
council
of
cologne
in
tried
in

to
give
the

a
chance
to
live
virtuous
lives
to
protect
them

to
have
no
less
than
seventy
concubines
the
old
and
wealthy
abbey
of
albans
was
little
more
than
a
den
of
prostitutes
with
whom
the
monks
lived
openly
and
avowedly
the
duke
of
nuremburg
in
was
concerned
with
the
clerical
immunity
of
monks
who
night
and
day
preyed
upon
the
virtue
of
the
wives

of
the
laity
the
church
openly
carried
on
a
sale
of
indulgences
in
lust
to
ecclesiastics
which
finally
took
the
form
of
a
tax
the
bishop
of
utrecht
in
issued
an
order
prohibiting
the
admittance
of
men
to
nunneries
in
spain
conditions
became
so
intolerable
that
the
communities
forced
their
priests
to
select
concubines
so
that
the
wives
and
daughters
would
be
safe
from
the
ravages
of
the
clergy
the
torture
the
maiming
and
the
murder
of
elgira
by
dunstan
illustrates
further
amongst
thousands
and
thousands
of
similar
bloody
deeds
the
diabolical
brutality
of
superstition
perpetuated
in
the
name
of
christianity
upon

contrived

to
degrade

the
ages
in

the

domination

the
status
of

was
no
better
than
the

of

this

religion

the

was
chiefly
responsible
for
the
terrible
persecutions
inflicted
on

on
the
ground

and
this
must
be
taken
into
calculation
when
one
considers
what
woman
owes
to

the

reduced

to
the

the
battle
was
begun
by
freethinkers
in
defiance
of
the
clergy
and
it
was
only
when
the
inevitable
conquest
of
this
movement
was
manifest
that
any
considerable
number
of
clergy
came
to
the
aid
of
this
progressive
movement
the
righting
of
the
wrongs
imposed
on
womankind
therefore
had
been
started
not
only
without
the
aid
of
the
churches
but
in
face
of
their
determined
opposition
it
was
not
the
clergy
that
discovered
the
injustice
that
had
been
done
to
women
throughout
the
centuries
and
when
it
was
finally
pointed
out
to
them
by
sceptics
it
was
the
rare
ecclesiastic
that
could
see
it
so
and
attempt
to
right
the
wrong
bell

tracing
this
struggle
of

this
pertinent
remark
to
make
if
there
are
any
personal
rights
in
this
world
over
which
church
and

should
have
no
control
it
is
the
sexual
right
of

say

these

are
so
deeply
imbedded
in

no

controvert
them

the

the
great

the
powers
of

so
far
as
experience

can
guide
us
are
unlimited
nor
are
we
possessed
of
any
evidence

authorizes
us
to
assign
even
an
imaginary
boundary
at
which
the
human

will
of
necessity
be

there
has
been
an
effort
made
in
certain
religious
publications
to
imply
that
there
is
a
dearth
of
thought
and
thinkers
beyond
the
pale
of
theism
the
subsequent
examination
of
the
theological
beliefs
of
great
minds
will
show
that
there
has
never
been
a
lack
of
brilliant
thinkers
who
have
not
sought
truth
apart
from
the
dominant
faith
of
their
age
it
was
socrates
i
believe
who
first
asked
if
it
was
not
a
base
superstition
that
mere
numbers
will
give
wisdom
granting
this
truth
it
certainly
can
not
be
claimed
that
the
philosophers
of
any
time
constituted
a
majority
of
any
population
nor
that
the
philosopher
as
such
was
not
greatly
in
advance
of
the
mental
status
of
the
populace
of
his
particular
age
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
briefly
comment
on
the
opinions
of
the
philosophers
both
ancient
and
modern
concerning
their
views
on
man
giant
shadow
hailed
divine
in
former
ages
philosophy
was
the
handmaiden
of
theology
from
the
time
of
socrates
and
plato
and
throughout
the
medieval
ages
the
foremost
task
of
the
philosopher
seemed
to
be
to
attempt
the
proof
of
the
existence
and
nature
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
leading
thinkers
of
the
seventeenth
century
hobbes
descartes
spinoza
leibnitz
and
malebranche
liberated
philosophy
from
its
bondage
to
theology
the
criticism
of
kant
of
the
philosophical
foundations
of
belief
destroyed
the
theological
proofs
and
modern
thinkers
now
spend
little
time
on
the
question
of
the
existence
and
nature
of
god
and
the
soul
modern
philosophy
has
been
completely
secularized
and
it
is
a
rare
occasion
to
find
a
philosopher
dwelling
on
the
problems
of
god
and
immortality
this
question
in
philosophy
as
in
all
other
branches
of
thought
is
utterly
irrelevant
and
at
present
there
is
less
insistence
on
god
and
more
on
the
world
man
morals
and
the
conditions
of
social
life
it
can
not
be
denied
that
we
are
under
a
heavy
obligation
intellectually
to
the
greek
philosophers
and
it
may
be
that
the
fruitful
efforts
of
those
minds
were
largely
due
to
their
unhampered
intellectual
freedom
they
had
no
holy
books
and
few
authorities
to
check
their
free
speculation
and
hence
these
greek
thinkers
furnish
the
first
instance
of
intellectual
freedom
from
which
arose
their
intelligent
criticism
and
speculation
they
discovered
skepticism
in
the
higher
and
proper
significance
of
the
word
and
this
was
their
supreme
contribution
to
human
thought
harvey
robinson
the
mind
in
the
making
we
know
the
teachings
of
socrates
only
through
his
disciple
plato
as
socrates
wrote
nothing
himself
from
this
source
we
gather
that
socrates
firmly
upheld
the
right
and
necessity
of
free
thought
he
was
mainly
a
moralist
and
reformer
and
attempted
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
by
finding
evidence
of
design
in
nature
he
rejected
the
crude
religious
ideas
of
his
nation
was
opposed
to
anthropomorphism
but
considered
it
his
duty
to
conform
publicly
to
this
belief
in
his
old
age
he
was
charged
with
rejecting
the
gods
of
the
state
and
was
sentenced
to
death
the
philosophy
of
plato
has
given
rise
to
diverse
interpretations
and
there
are
those
who
on
reading
the
dialogues
believe
that
it
is
not
amiss
to
state
that
in
certain
utterances
there
is
ground
to
hold
that
plato
argued
for
the
pragmatic
value
of
a
belief
in
god
and
personal
immortality
that
he
does
not
stress
the
truth
of
the
matter
but
argues
mainly
for
the
benefit
which
the
state
derives
from
the
belief
that
such
theistic
beliefs
can
not
be
demonstrated
and
may
well
be
but
a
craving
and
a
hope
yet
it
will
be
of
no
harm
to
believe
he
inferred
the
existence
of
god
from
what
he
considered
the
intelligence
and
design
manifested
in
natural
objects
mainly
however
plato
theism
was
founded
upon
his
doctrine
of
a
universe
of
ideas
and
as
no
one
today
holds
that
ideas
are
realities
the
foundation
of
his
theism
is
destroyed
james
harvey
robinson
in
his
mind
in
the
making
discusses
the
influence
of
plato
and
remarks
plato
made
terms
with
the
welter
of
things
but
sought
relief
in
the
conception
of
supernal
models
eternal
in
the
heavens
after
which
all
things
were
imperfectly
fashioned
he
confessed
that
he
could
not
bear
to
accept
a
world
which
was
like
a
leaky
pot
or
a
man
running
at
the
nose
in
short
he
ascribed
the
highest
form
of
existence
to
ideals
and
abstractions
this
was
a
new
and
sophisticated
republication
of
savage
animism
it
invited
lesser
minds
than
his
to
indulge
in
all
sorts
of
noble
vagueness
and
impertinent
jargon
which
continue
to
curse
our
popular
discussions
of
human
affairs
he
consecrated
one
of
the
chief
foibles
of
the
human
mind
and
elevated
it
to
a
religion
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
is
commonly
known
to
be
the
reverse
of
plato
plato
started
with
universals
the
very
existence
of
which
was
a
matter
of
faith
and
from
these
he
descended
to
particulars
aristotle
on
the
other
hand
argued
from
particulars
to
universals
and
this
inductive
method
was
the
true
beginning
of
science
the
accumulated
knowledge
of
his
age
did
not
furnish
him
facts
enough
upon
which
to
build
and
he
had
to
resort
to
speculation
it
does
not
detract
from
the
stupendous
achievement
of
this
man
that
the
clergy
of
the
middle
ages
in
control
of
the
few
isolated
centers
of
learning
looked
upon
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
as
final
and
considered
his
works
as
and
in
their
immersion
in
and
unreality
exalted
as
immutable
and
infallible
the
absurdities
in
the
speculations
of
a
mind
limited
to
the
knowledge
of
centuries
before
theirs
in
the
attempt
to
explain
plant
and
animal
life
aristotle
formulated
the
theory
that
a
special
form
of
animating
principle
was
involved
the
élan
vital
of
bergson
and
the
theory
of
joad
are
modern
reiterations
of
this
conception
aristotle
is
not
quite
consistent
when
he
attempts
to
give
us
his
theistic
beliefs
at
times
god
is
for
him
a
mysterious
spirit
that
never
does
anything
and
has
not
any
desire
or
will
elsewhere
he
conceives
god
as
pure
energy
a
prime
mover
unmoved
certain
modern
physicists
still
cling
to
this
aristotelian
god
this
conception
of
a
deity
was
far
from
the
beliefs
of
his
age
and
it
is
not
strange
that
aristotle
was
charged
with
impiety
and
with
having
taught
that
prayer
and
sacrifice
were
of
no
avail
he
fled
from
athens
and
shortly
afterwards
died
in
exile
these
three
supreme
greek
thinkers
socrates
plato
and
aristotle
have
not
contributed
a
single
argument
for
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
which
is
now
not
discredited
socrates
relied
on
the
now
outmoded
argument
from
design
and
only
in
a
greatly
modified
form
are
the
arguments
of
plato
and
aristotle
accepted
by
modern
theists
holding
such
heretical
views
in
an
age
when
history
was
a
frail
fabric
of
legends
and
the
scientific
explanation
of
nature
in
its
extreme
infancy
what
would
their
views
be
today
in
the
consideration
of
the
greek
thinkers
of
lesser
importance
one
finds
that
they
were
continually
storming
against
the
religious
conceptions
of
the
populace
the
philosophers
were
ever
unpopular
with
the
credulous
damon
and
anaxagoras
were
banished
aspasia
was
impeached
for
blasphemy
and
the
tears
of
pericles
alone
saved
her
socrates
was
put
to
death
plato
was
obliged
to
reserve
pure
reason
for
a
chosen
few
and
to
adulterate
it
with
revelation
for
the
generality
of
his
disciples
aristotle
fled
from
athens
for
his
life
and
became
the
tutor
of
alexander
reade
the
martyrdom
of
man
anaxagoras
the
friend
and
master
of
pericles
euripides
and
socrates
was
accused
by
the
superstitious
athenians
of
atheism
and
impiety
to
the
gods
he
was
condemned
to
death
and
barely
escaped
this
fate
through
the
influence
of
pericles
which
resulted
in
the
accusation
of
atheism
against
pericles
euripides
was
accused
of
heresy
and
aeschylus
was
condemned
to
be
stoned
to
death
for
blasphemy
and
was
saved
from
this
fate
by
his
brother
aminias
the
philosophy
of
parmenides
was
distinctly
pantheistic
and
pythagoras
who
attempted
to
purify
the
religion
of
the
greeks
and
free
it
from
its
absurdities
and
superstitions
was

his
scepticism
democritus

mechanical
view
of
phenomena
in

with
which
everything
that
happens

such
a
materialism
was
a
great
liberation
from

and
had
it
survived
in
its
integrity
the

wisdom
would
have
been
vastly
different
from
what
it
was
what
the
path
would
have
been
we
are
beginning
to
see
for
since
the
nineteenth
century
we
have
been
treading
it
more
or
less
consistently
but
by
no
means
so
gallantly
and
courageously
as
democritus
boas
the
adventures
of
human
thought
democritus
and
the
epicureans
strove
to
deliver
men
from
their
two
chief
apprehensions
the
fear
of
the
gods
and
the
fear
of
death
and
in
so
doing
rejected
the
religious
beliefs
and
substituted
a
rational
and
scientific
conception
of
the
universe
it
was
xenophanes
the
voltaire
of
greece
who
brought
to
the
attention
of
his
countrymen
the
discovery
that
man
created
the
gods
in
his
own
image
he
attacked
the
conceptions
of
the
greek
deities
with
these
words
mortals
deem
that
the
gods
are
begotten
as
they
are
and

considering
greek
philosophy
in
its
entirety
we
see
that
it
was
naturalistic
rather
than
supernaturalistic
and
rationalistic
rather
than
mystical
these
gifted
men
saw
no
clear
indication
for
the
existence

professor
boas
in
contrasting
asiatic
mythology
with
greek
philosophy
remarks
the
asiatic
myths
assumed
the
existence
of
beings
beyond
the
world
not
subject
to
mundane
laws
who
made
and
controlled
the
course
of
events
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
have
made
a
world
they
seemed
to
be
living
as
divine
a
life
without
it
as
with
it
the
question
was
one
which
persisted
in
asiatic
thought
and
when
christianity
became
dominant
in
europe
much
of
its
theologians
time
was
spent
in
answering
it
the
only
plausible
answer
then
was
that
god
made
the
world
because
he
felt
like
it
for
no
reason
could
be
given
sufficiently
compelling
to
sway
the
will
of
the
omnipotent
but
such
an
answer
was
unsatisfactory
to
the
greek
in
his
philosophy
all
this
is
changed
no

steps
out
of
the

thing
which

by
the

its
own
nature
its
every
movement
is
theoretically
open
to
the
scrutiny
of
reason
and
hence
a
scientific
rather
than
a
religious
answer
can
be
given
to
every
question
at
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
the
cultured
romans
were
stoics
or
epicureans
the
poet
lucretius
was
an
epicurean
who
regarded
the
belief
in
the
gods
as
a
product
of
the
terrors
of
primitive
man
and
recommended
that
the
mind
should
be
emancipated
from
the
fear
of
the
gods
and
argued
against
the
immortality
of
the
soul
seneca
epictetus
and
marcus
aurelius
were
stoics
cicero
insinuates
that
the
gods
are
only
poetical
creations
that
the
popular
doctrine
of
punishment
in
a
world
to
come
is
only
an
idle
fable
and
is
uncertain
whether
the
soul
is
immortal
seneca

of

country
and

philosophy
of
cultured
romans
of
the
time
of
the
physician
galen
tended
towards
atheism
the
prime
factor
of
greek
philosophy
was
the
insistence
on
intelligence
and
knowledge
and
by
these
means
it
reached
its
pinnacle
of
reasoning
the
blight
that
exterminated
all
scientific
progress
with
the
fall
of
the

empire
carried
with
it
the
neglect
of
the
greek
thinkers
similar
to
the
retrogression
of
scientific
thought
traced
in

the
corresponding
retrogression
in
philosophic
thought
in

the

that
of

time
of

most
of

greek
writings
had
disappeared
in
western
europe
the
greatest
store
of
greek
thought
was
in
the
hands
of
the
arab
scholars
and
led
to
a
marked
scepticism
as
we
see
manifested
in
the
writings
of
the
spanish
moors
it
is
significant
that
during
the
age
of
faith
in
europe
no
philosopher
of
merit
arose
and
the
only
philosophy
permitted
was
the
puerile
this
scholastic
philosophy
hemmed
in
between
metaphysics
and
theology
sought
to
reconcile
plato
plotinus
and
aristotle
with
the
needs
of
orthodoxy
and
split
hairs
over
subtle
essences
and
entities
francis

and

wits

reading

their
wits

up
in

their
persons
were
shut
up
in
the
cells
of
monasteries

and
knowing
little
history
either
of
nature

did
out

no

quantity

matter
and
infinite
agitation
of
wit
spin
out
unto
us
those
laborious
webs
of
learning
which
are
extant
in
their
books
the
sole
preoccupation
of
medieval
philosophy
seemed
to
be
conjectures
as
to
what
would
happen
to
man
after
death
and
the
entire
system
of
thought
was
based
on
authority
the
medieval
philosopher
turned
in
disdain
from
the
arduous
path
of
investigation
of
actual
phenomena
and
confidently
believed
that
he
could
find
truth
by
easy
reliance
upon
revelation
and
the
elaboration
of
dogmas
a

brave
minds
rebelled
against
this
unnatural
imprisonment
of
the
intellect

usual
consequences

montaigne
the
pioneer
of

scepticism
gave
voice
to
his
repugnance
for
dogmas
in
his
brilliant
essays
in
which
he
stated
that
all

are
the

of

and
that
he
doubted
if
out
of
the
immense
number
of
religious

there
were
any

were

bacon
hobbes
locke
and
descartes
were
the
inaugurators
of
a
school
of
thought
which
is
characterized
by
its
practical
spirit
and
while
these
men
professed
theistic
beliefs
their
systems
of
thought
had
done
much
when
applied
and
amplified
by
their
followers
to
undermine
that
belief
these
men
furnished
the
source
of
a
later
agnosticism
thomas
hobbes
agreed
with
bacon
and
galileo
that
all
knowledge
starts
from
experience
and
carrying
out
the
inductive
method
of
bacon
he
produced
his
leviathan
in
it
was
promptly
attacked
by
the
clergy
of
every
country
in
europe
hobbes
says
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
it
is
a
belief
grounded
upon
other
men
sayings
that
they
knew
it
supernaturally
or
that
they
knew
those
who
knew
them
that
knew
others
that
knew
it
supernaturally
locke
concerned
himself
with
a
philosophic
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
mind
itself
and
was
looked
upon
as
a
destroyer
of
the
faith
descartes
based
his
philosophy
on
the
rejection
of
authority
in
favor
of
human
reason
for
which
his
works
were
honored
by
being
placed
on
the
index
in
hume
with
the
publication
of
the
highly
heretical
treatise
on
human
nature
threw
consternation
into
the
ranks
of
the
theists
his
theory
of
knowledge
played
havoc
with
the
old
arguments
for
belief
in
god
and
immortality
of
the
soul
his
works
were
widely
read
and
were
instrumental
in
leading
to
the
philosophical
agnosticism
of
the
nineteenth
century
spinoza
religious
views
seemed
in
his
time
little
short
of
atheism
and
brought
him
the
hostility
of
both
jews
and
christians
to
which
was
added
the
excommunication
from
the
synagogue
in
his
philosophy
god
and
nature
are
equivalent
terms
and
it
is
pantheistic
only
in
the
sense
that
if
man
is
to
have
a
god
at
all
nature
must
be
that
god
and
whatever
man
considers
godlike
must
be
found
in
nature
spinoza
recognizes
no
supernatural
realm
and
denies
the
survival
of
personal
memory
professor

in
his
adventures
of
human
thought
discusses
the
attitude
of
public
opinion
of
the
time
of
spinoza
he
was
the
the
materialist
the
subverter
of
all
that
was
held
most
dear
by
the
reigning
powers
it
was
only
after
the
french
revolution
that
he
came
into
his
own
when
certain
germans
captivated
by
emphasized
the
pantheistic
element
in
him
but
by
then
christianity
had
ceased
to
be
a
dominant
intellectual
force
and
had
become
what
it
is
today
a
folk
belief
in
the
tractus
spinoza
states
when
people
declare
as
all
are
ready
to
do
that
the
bible
is
the
word
of
god
teaching
men
true
blessedness
and
the
way
of
salvation
they
evidently
do
not
mean
what
they
say
for
the
masses
take
no
pains
at
all
to
live
according
to
scripture
and
we
see
most
people
endeavoring
to
hawk
about
their
own
commentaries
as
the
word
of
god
and
giving
their
best
efforts
under
the
guise
of
religion
to
compelling
others
to
think
as
they
do
we
generally
see
i
say
theologians
anxious
to
learn
how
to
wring
their
inventions
and
sayings
out
of
the
sacred
text
and
to
fortify
them

as

taught
that

should
be

the

opposition
of

little
need
be
said
except
to
recall
our
debt
to
his
victory
over
ecclesiasticism
and
superstition
his
assertion
that
a
fanaticism
composed
of
superstition
and
ignorance
has
been
the
sickness
of
all
the
centuries
still
holds
too
great
an
extent
of
truth
his
denial
of
miracles
the
supernatural
efficacy
of
prayer
and
the
immortality
of

earned

the
critique

of

demolished
the
ontological
and
the
cosmological
arguments
for
the
existence
of
god
and
showed
the
weakness
in
the
teleological
argument
he
demonstrated
that
all
the
current
arguments
for

the
entire
basis
of
rational
proof
of

were
invalid

immanuel
kant
in
his
critique
of
practical
reason
however
he
went
on
to
restore
the
credit
of
religion
through
the
moral
sense
the
categorical
imperative
and
as
certain
commentators
have
stated
after
having
excluded
god
from
the
cosmos
he
attempted
to
find
him
again
in
ethics
holding
that
the
moral
sense
is
innate
and
not
derived
from
experience
he
reduced
the
truth
of
religion
to
moral
faith
kant
believed
that
he
found
a
divine
command
in
his
own
conscience
but
the
science
of
ethics
now
gives
a
natural
account
of
moral
laws
and
sentiments
the
study
of
the
evolution
of
our
moral
ideas
has
today
destroyed
kant
theory
of
an
innate
and
absolute
moral
sense
when
franklin
showed
the
nature
of
lightning
the
voice
of
god
was
displaced
from
that
of
thunder
the
sciences
of
ethics
and
psychology
like
modern
franklins
show
plainly
that
conscience
is
no
more
the
voice
of
god
than
is
thunder
schopenhauer
commenting
on
kantian
theology
offers
the
suggestion
that
kant
was
really
a
sceptic
but
became
frightened
when
he
contemplated
what
he
thought
would
happen
to
public
morals
if
belief
were
to
be
denied
to
the
masses
nietzsche
speaks
of
kant
with
the
aid
of
his
concept
of
reason
he
produced
a
special
kind
of
reason
for
use
on
occasions
when
reason
can
not
function
namely
when
the
sublime
command
shalt
resounds
in
his
old
age
kant
became
more
bold
and
perhaps
voiced
his
true
views
for
we
find
that
in
religion
within
the
limits
of
pure
reason
he
is
actively
antagonistic
to
ecclesiasticism
so
much
so
that
for
publishing
this
work
he
was
censured
by
the
prussian
king
who
wrote
our
highest
person
has
been
greatly
displeased
to
observe
how
you
misuse
your
philosophy
to
undermine
and
destroy
many
of
the
most
important
and
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
of
christianity
indeed
many
a
man
approaching
kant
with
a
firm
theistic
belief
finds
his
belief
somewhat
shaken
by
kantian
logic
schopenhauer
will
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
as
commonly
held
and
he
was
bitterly
in
a
dialogue
entitled

he
places
these
words
in
the
mouth
of
his
character
philalethes
a
certain
amount
of
general
ignorance
is
the
condition
of
all

the
element
in
which
alone
they
can
exist
and
as
soon
as
astronomy

science

history
the
knowledge
of
countries
and
peoples
have
spread
their
light
broadcast
and
philosophy
finally
is
permitted
to
say
a
word
every
faith
founded
on

must
disappear

takes
its

herbert

spencer
in

argues
in
this
manner
those
who
can
not
conceive
of
a
universe
and
therefore
assume
a
creator
as
the
source
of
the
universe
take
for

that
they
can
conceive
a
creator
the
mystery
which
they
recognize
in
this
great
fact
surrounding
them
on
every
side
they
transfer
to
an
alleged
source
of
this
great
fact
and
then
suppose
that
they
have
solved
the
mystery
but
they
delude
themselves
is
inconceivable
and
this
holds
true
whatever
be
the
nature
of
the
object
of
which
it
is
predicated
whoever
agrees
that
the
atheistic
hypothesis
is
untenable
because
it
involves
the
impossible
idea
of

perforce
admit
that
the
theistic
hypothesis
is
untenable
if
it
contains
the
same
impossible
idea
if
religion
and
science
are
to
be
reconciled
the
basis
of
reconciliation
must
be
this
deepest
widest
and
most
certain
of
all
facts
that
the
power
which
the
universe
manifests
to
us
is
inscrutable
nietzsche
the
great
liberator
of
modern

vigorously
opposed
religious
morality
the
influence
of

and
all
religious
beliefs
when
the
natural
consequences
of

action
he

are
no

looked
upon
as
natural
but
are
considered
to
be
produced
by
the
phantasms
of
superstition
by

and
appear
as
consequences
as
rewards
punishments

then
the
whole

is
destroyed

the
greatest
possible
crime
against
humanity
has
been
committed
william
james
claimed
as
a
supporter
of

argues
that
our
inner
experience
makes
us
cognizant
of

the

of
psychological
research
does
not
deal
kindly
with

he
stated
drawn
from

order
of

which
a
century
ago
seemed
so
overwhelmingly
convincing
today
does
little
more
than
gather
dust
in

for
the
simple
reason
that
our
generation
has

to
be
a
pluralist
in
the
sense
that
there
are
several

one

just
as

outside

the

sorts
intellectual

moral
the
intellectual
objection
is
that
there

no
reason
to
suppose
any
religion
true
the
moral
objection
is
that
religious
precepts
date
from
a
time
when
men
were
more
cruel
than
they
are
now
and
therefore
tend
to
perpetuate
inhumanities

a
quotation
from
the
associated
press
appearing
recently
in
one
of

magazines
states
the
need
for
this
new
religion
as
being
the
inadequacy
of
the
religious
forms
and
ideas
of
our
fathers
and
the
new
creed
to
be
religious
humanists
regard
the
universe
as
and
not
created
religion
must
formulate
its
hopes
and
plans
in
the
light
of
the
scientific
spirit
and
method
the
distinction
between
the
sacred
and
secular
can
no
longer
be
maintained
religious
humanism
considers
the
complete
realization
of
human
personality
to
be
the
end
of
a
man
life
and
seeks
its
development
and
fulfilment
in
the
here
and
now
in
place
of
the
old
attitudes
involved
in
worship
and
prayer
the
humanist
finds
his
religious
emotions
exprest
in
a
heightened
sense
of
personal
life
and
in
a
cooperative
effort
to
promote
social
there
will
be
no
uniquely
religious
emotions
and
attitudes
of
the
kind
hitherto
associated
with
belief
in
the
supernatural
man
will
learn
to
face
the
crises
of
life
in
terms
of
his
knowledge
of
their
naturalness
and
probability
reasonable
and
manly
attitudes
will
be
fostered
by
education
and
supported
custom
we
assume
that
humanism
will
take
the
path
of
social
and
mental
hygiene
and
discourage
sentimental
and
unreal
hopes
and
wishful
thinking
the
goal
of
humanism
is
a
free
and
universal
society
in
which
the
people
voluntarily
and
intelligently
cooperate
for
the
common
good
the
time
has
come
for
widespread
recognition
of
the
radical
changes

thoughts
throughout

disrupted
the
old

religions
the
world
over
are
under
the
necessity
of
coming
to

created

vastly
increased
knowledge

professors
john

burtt
and
roy
wood
sellars
are
among
the
signers
of
this
statement
it
is
an
excellent
and
comprehensive
statement
but
one
is
left
wondering
why
the
name
religious
humanism
it
is
difficult
to
become
enthusiastic
when
one
realizes
that
these
men
take
to
themselves
the
thunder
of
the
atheists
of
the
past
and
under
the
misnomer
religious
place
before
the
public
what
all
atheists
of
the
past
ages
have
been
preaching
it
is
most
gratifying
to
perceive
that
such
distinguished
men
as
signed
this
statement
are
frank
enough
to
admit
the
extent
of
the
religious
revolution
and
determined
enough
to
take
a
hand
in
the
clearing
away
of
the
débris
that
clutters
the
crumbling
of
all
religious
creeds
yet
it
is
only
fair
to
point
out
that
this
statement
contains
nothing
that
would
not
be
recognized
by
those
intrepid
atheists
of
the
past
and
little
more
than
they
urged
in
their
time
i

those
brilliant

the
doom
of

the
necessity
of

should
recall
the
charge
of
atheism
directed
against
the
keenest
thinkers
of
antiquity
and
the
greatest
of
its
moral
reformers
but
what
was
personal
and
incidental
in
the
past
depending
largely
upon
the
genius
and
inspiration
of
seers
and
leaders
has
now
become
a
social
movement
as
wide
as

drift

in

christianity
has
divided
itself
into
catholicism

protestantism
and
when
protestantism
gave
the
right
of
interpretation
of

to

there
were
evolved
such
forms
of
protestantism
as

doukhobors
the

the

the

and
the

army
in
the
early
days
of

the
wrangling
of
sects
the
incomprehensible
jargon
of
arians
nestorians
eutychians
monotheists
monophysites
mariolatrists
etc
today
we
behold
the
incomprehensible
jargon
of
the
sects
christ
born
of
an
immaculate
virgin
died
for
mankind
arose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
into
heaven
buddha
who
lived
over
years
before
jesus
was
born
of
the
virgin
maya
which
is
the
same
as
mary
maya
conceived
by
the
holy
ghost
and
thus
buddha
was
of
the
nature
of
god
and
man
combined
buddha
was
born
on
december
his
birth
was
announced
in
the
heavens
by
a
star
and
angels
sang
he
stood
upon
his
feet
and
spoke
at
the
moment
of
his
birth
at
five
months
of
age
he
sat
unsupported
in
the
air
and
at
the
moment
of
his
conversion
he
was
attacked
by
a
legion
of
demons
he
was
visited
by
wise
men
he
was
baptized
transfigured
performed
miracles
rose
from
the
dead
and
on
his
ascension
through
the
air
to
heaven
he
left
his
footprint
on
a
mountain
in
ceylon
the
hindu
savior
krishna
was
born
of
a
virgin
years
before
christ
a
star
shone
at
his
birth
which
took
place
in
a
cave
he
was
adored
by
cowherds
who
recognized
his
greatness
he
performed
miracles
was
crucified
and
is
to
come
to
judge
the
earth
christ
died
for
mankind
so
did
buddha
and
krishna
adonis
osiris
horus
and
tammuz
all
gods
were
saviors
and
suffered
death
christ
rose
from
the
dead
so
have
krishna
and
buddha
arisen
from
the
dead
and
ascended
into
heaven
so
did
lao
kium
zoroaster
and
mithra
a

shone
in
the
sky
at
the
births
of
krishna
rama
yu
lao
tsze
moses
quetzalcoatl
ormuzd
rama
buddha
and
others
christ
was
born
of

so
was
krishna
and
buddha
lao
tsze
was
also
born
of
a

horus
in

was

isis
with

were

born
by

zeus
father

visited

and
she
gave

to
the
great

dionysis
mithra
was
born
of
a

in

on

of

he
was
buried
in
a
tomb
from
which
he
rose
again
he
was
called
savior
and
mediator
and
sometimes
figured
as
a

osiris
was
also
said
to
be
born
about
the
of
december
he
suffered
died
and
was
resurrected
hercules
was
miraculously
conceived
from
a
divine
father
and
was
everywhere
invoked
as

minerva
had

quetzalcoatl
the

was
the
son
of
chimalman
the
virgin
queen
of
heaven
he
was
tempted
fasted
forty
days
was
done
to
death
and
his
second
coming
was
eagerly
looked
for
by
the
natives
the
teutonic
goddess
hertha
was
a
virgin
and
the
sacred

of
germany
contained
her
image
with
a

in
her
arms
the
scandinavian
goddess
frigga
was
a
virgin
who
bore
a
son
balder
healer
and
savior
of
mankind
when
one
considers
the
similarity
of
these
ancient
pagan
legends
and
beliefs
with
christian
traditions
if
one
believes
with
justin
martyr
then
indeed
the
devil
must
have
been
a
very
busy
person
to
have
caused
these
pagans
to
imitate
for
such
long
ages
and
in
such
widespread
localities
the
christian
mysteries
indeed

comments
one
has
only
instead
of
the
word
to
read
dionysis
or
krishna
or
hercules
or
osiris
or
attis
and
instead
of
to
insert
semele
or
devaki

or
nona
and
for
pontius
pilate
to
use
the
name
of
any

who

and
lo
the

fits
in

particulars
into
the

and
worship
of

the
parentage
of

was
said
to
be
the
offspring
of
an
immaculate

he
was
free
from

was

as
the
adopted
son
of

mary
francis
the

peace

the

in

centuries
before

we
find
the

as
well
as

the
ninth

professor
james
shotwell
when
speaking
of
paganism
reminds
us
who
of
us
can
appreciate
antique
paganism
the
gods
of
greece
or
rome
are
for
us
hardly
more
than
the
mutilated
statues
of
them
in
our
own
museums
pitiable
helpless
objects
before
the
scrutiny
and
comments
of
a
passing
crowd
venus
is
an
armless
figure
from
the
louvre
dionysos
does
not
mean
to
us
divine
possession
the
gift
of
tongues
or
immortality
attis
brings
no
salvation
but
to
antiquity
the
cults
were
no
mockery
they
were
as
real
as
polynesian
heathenism
or
christianity
religious
revolution
of
it
is
seen
therefore
that
from
time
immemorial
man
does
not
discover
his
gods
invents
he
invents
them
in
the
light
of
his
experience
and
endows
them
with
capacities
that
indicate
the
stage
of
man
mental
development
religion
is
not
the
product
of
civilized
man
man
inherits
his
god
just
as
he
inherits
his
physical
qualities
the
idea
of
a
supernatural
being
creating
and
governing
this
earth
is
a
phantom
born
in
the
mind
of
the
savage
if
it
had
not
been
born
in
the
early
stages
of
man
mental
development
it
surely
would
not
come
into
existence
now
history
proves
that
as
the
mind
of
man
expands
it
does
not
discover
new
gods
but
that
it
discards
them
it
is
not
strange
therefore
that
there
has
not
been
advanced
a
new
major
religious
belief
in
the
last
years
all
modern
religious
conceptions
no
matter
how
disguised
find
their
origin
in
the
ignorance
of
the
primitive
savage
a
christian
will
admit
that
the
gods
of
others
are
and
that
their
creed
is
similar
to
the
worship
of
the
savage
he
looks
at
their
gods
with
the
vision
of
a
civilized
being
but
when
he
looks
at
his
own
god
he
forgets
his
civilization
he
relapses
centuries
of
time
and
mental
viewpoint
is
that
of
the
savage
christianity
with
its
primitive
concepts
can
make
its
adherents
firm
in
the
belief
of
great
monstrosities
when
its
adherents
believed
that
the
bible
sanctioned
the
destruction
of
heretics
and
witches
they
were
certainly
doing
things
from
a
christian
standpoint
it
was
this
standpoint
that
justified
an
embittered
denunciation
of
evolution
at
one
time
and
then
recanting
adopted
it
as
a
part
of
the
bible
teaching
when
the
spaniards
blotted
out
an
entire
civilization
in
south
america
when
catholics
butchered
protestants
or
protestants
butchered
catholics
they
were
all
justified
from
the
christian
standpoint
man
has
been
living
on
this
planet
some
years
jesus
appeared
less
than
years
ago
to
save
mankind
what
of
those
countless
millions
of
men
that
died
before
christ
came
to
save
the
world
from
damnation
if
the
christian
creed
that
except
a
man
believes
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
he
can
not
be
saved
is
maintained
then
it
must
be
that
those
millions
of
human
beings
who
lived
before
christ
and
had
no
chance
to
believe
are
in
it
is
probable
that
one
of
the
factors
that
turned
primitive
attention
away
from
his
cruel
and
short
earthly
existence
to
the
thought
of
a
more
lengthy
and
less
cruel
existence
in
a
hereafter
was
the
extreme
uncertainty
and
short
duration
of
his
own
life
and
this
primitive
trend
of
thought
that
turns
man
mind
from
the
here
and
now
to
a
contemplation
of
a
mythical
hereafter
persists
to
this
day
produces
the
same
slavish
resignation
this
false
release
from
the
actualities
constitute
a
mental
aberration
which
we
see
in
the
hysterical
and
when
such
an
individual
is
confronted
by
problems
that
tax
his
mental
strength
if
that
individual
has
not
strength
of
mind
to
reason
and
to
persevere
so
that
he
overcomes
his
environmental
difficulties
he
will
seek
an
avenue
of
escape
in
a
fanciful
existence
which
the
physician
recognizes
in
hysteria
and
certain
forms
of
mental
disease
so
throughout
the
ages
man
has
sought
release
from
the
realities
of
his
existence
into
a
fanciful
and
pleasantly
delusional
flight
into
a
hereafter
there
is
no
salvation
in
that
sickly
obscurantism
which
attempts
to
evade
realities
by
confusing
itself
about
them
safety
lies
only
in
clarity
and
the
struggle
for
the
light
no
subliminal
nor
fringe
of
consciousness
can
rank
in
the
intellectual
life
beside
the
burning
focal
center
where
the
rays
of
knowledge
converge
the
hope
must
be
in
following
reason
not
in
thwarting
it
to
turn
back
from
it
is
not
mysticism
it
is
superstition
no
we
must
be
prepared
to
see
the
higher
criticism
destroy
the
historicity
of
the
most
sacred
texts
of
the
bible
psychology
analyze
the
phenomena
of
conversion
on
the
basis
of
adolescent
passion
anthropology
explain
the
genesis
of
the
very
idea
of
god
an
where
can
understand
it
is
a
moral
crime
to
cherish
the
religious
revolution
of
religious
beliefs
are
clearly
mental
aberrations
from
which
it
is
high
time
that
the
progress
of
knowledge
should
lead
to
a
logical
cure
man
is
steadily
overcoming
and
conquering
his
environment
the
uncertainty
of
life
and
cruelty
are
much
diminished
as
compared
with
the
past
ages
but
man
has
not
as
yet
fully
utilized
the
means
of
an
emancipating
measure
from
his
mental
enslavement
and
fear
of
his
environment
chapman
cohen
in
his
theism
or
atheism
clearly
states
we
know
that
man
does
not
discover
god
he
invents
him
and
an
invention
is
properly
discarded
when
a
better
instrument
is
forthcoming
the
hypothesis
of
god
stands
in
just
the
same
relation
to
the
better
life
of
as
the
fire
drill
of
the
savage
does
to
the
modern
method
of
obtaining
a
light
the
belief
in
god
may
continue
awhile
in
virtue
of
the
lack
of
intelligence
of
some
of
the
carelessness
of
others
and
of
the
conservative
character
of
the
mass
but
no
amount
of
apologizing
can
make
up
for
the
absence
of
genuine
knowledge
nor
can
the
flow
of
the
finest
eloquence
do
aught
but
clothe
in
regal
raiment
the
body
of
a
corpse
religion
arose
as
a
means
of
explanation
of
natural
phenomena
at
a
time
when
no
other
explanation
of
the
origin
of
natural
phenomena
had
been
ascertained
god
is
always
what
spinoza
called
it
the
asylum
of
ignorance
when
causes
are
unknown
god
is
brought
forward
when
causes
are
known
god
retires
into
the
background
in
an
age
of
ignorance
god
is
active
in
an
age
of
science
he
is
impotent
history
attests
this
fact
the
single
and
outstanding
characteristic
of
the
conception
of
god
at
all
times
and
under
all
conditions
is
that
it
is
the
equivalent
of
ignorance
in
primitive
times
it
is
ignorance
of
the
character
of
the
natural
forces
that
leads
to
the
assumption
of
the
existence
of
gods
and
in
this
respect
the
god
idea
has
remained
true
to
itself
throughout
even
whenever
the
principle
of
god
is
invoked
a
very
slight
examination
is
enough
to
show
that
the
only
reason
for
this
being
done
is
our
ignorance
of
the
subject
before
us
the
belief
in
god
is
least
questioned
where
civilization
is
lowest
it
is
called
into
the
most
serious
question
where
civilization
is
most
advanced
it
is
clear
that
had
primitive
man
known
what
we
know
today
about
nature
the
gods
would
never
have
been
born
the
suspicious
feature
must
be
pointed
out
that
the
belief
in
god
owes
its
existence
not
to
the
trained
and
educated
observation
of
civilized
times
but
to
the
uncritical
reflection
of
the
primitive
mind
it
has
its
origin
there
and
it
would
indeed
be
remarkable
if
while
in
almost
every
other
direction
the
primitive
mind
showed
itself
to
be
hopelessly
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
the
world
in
this
particular
respect
it
has
proved
itself
to
be
altogether
right
all
intelligent
men
admit
that
human
welfare
depends
upon
our
knowledge
and
our
ability
to
harness
the
forces
of
nature
i
myself
writes
llewelyn
powys
do
not
doubt
that
the
good
fortune
of
the
human
race
depends
more
on
science
than
on
religion
in
all
directions
the
bigotry
of
the
churches
obstructs
amelioration
as
long
as
the
majority
of
men
rely
upon
supernatural
interference
supernatural
guidance
from
a
human
point
of
view
all
is
likely
to
be
confusion
trusting
in
god
rather
than
in
man
it
is
in
the
nature
of
these
blind
worshippers
to
oppose
every
advance
of
human
knowledge
it
was
they
who
condemned
galileo
who
resisted
darwin
and
who
deride
the
doctrines
of
freud
science
has
given
us
an
account
of
the
operation
of
the
universe
god
and
investigation
has
also
given
us
a
clear
conception
of
the
evolution
of
all
religious
beliefs
from
the
crude
conceptions
of
the
savage
to
the
but
little
altered
form
of
the
modern
conception
if
we
are
to
regard
the
god
idea
as
an
evolution
which
began
in
the
ignorance
of
primitive
man
it
would
seem
clear
that
no
matter
how
refined
or
developed
the
idea
may
become
it
can
rest
on
no
other
or
sounder
basis
than
which
is
presented
to
us
in
the
psychology
of
primitive
man
each
stage
of
theistic
belief
grows
out
of
the
proceeding
stage
and
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
beginning
of
this
evolution
arose
in
a
huge
blunder
i
quite
fail
to
see
how
any
subsequent
development
can
convert
this
unmistakable
blunder
into
a
demonstrable
truth
men
of
today
are
trying
to
force
themselves
to
believe
that
there
must
be
something
true
in
that
which
had
been
believed
by
so
many
great
and
pious
men
of
old
but
it
is
in
vain
intellect
has
outgrown
faith
they
are
aware
of
the
fallacy
of
their
opinions
yet
angry
that
another
should
remind
them
of
it
and
these
men
who
today
are
secretly
sceptics
are
loudest
in
their
public
denunciation
of
others
who
publicly
announce
their
scepticism
in
ancient
greece
when
the
philosophers
came
into
prominence
zeus
was
superseded
by
the
air
and
poseidon
by
the
water
in
modern
times
all
hitherto
supernatural
events
are
being
explained
by
physical
laws
plato
regarded
it
as
a
patriotic
duty
to
accept
the
public
faith
although
he
full
well
knew
the
absurdities
of
that
faith
today
there
are
many
platos
that
hold
to
the
same
conviction
the
freethinkers
hold
to
the
view
of
xenophanes
who
denounced
the
public
faith
as
an
ancient
blunder
which
had
been
converted
by
time
into
a
national
imposture
all
religion
is
a
delusion
which
transfers
the
motives
and
thoughts
of
men
to
those
who
are
not
men
no
ecclesiastic
has
as
yet
offered
a
satisfactory
answer
as
to
why
there
has
been
a
marvelous
disappearance
of
the
working
of
miracles
and
why
human
actions
alone
are
now
to
be
seen
in
this
world
of
ours
we
are
witnessing
today
what
happened
in
the
roman
empire
during
the
decline
of
polytheism
draper
states
between
that
period
during
which
a
nation
has
been
governed
by
its
imagination
and
that
in
which
it
submits
to
reason
there
is
a
melancholy
interval
the
constitution
of
man
is
such
that
for
a
long
time
after
he
has
discovered
the
incorrectness
of
the
ideas
prevailing
around
him
he
shrinks
from
openly
emancipating
himself
from
their
dominion
and
constrained
by
the
force
of
circumstances
he
becomes
a
hypocrite
publicly
applauding
what
his
private
judgment
condemns
where
a
nation
is
making
this
passage
so
universal
do
these
practices
become
that
it
may
be
truly
said
hypocrisy
is
organized
it
is
possible
that
whole
communities
might
be
found
living
in
this
deplorable
state
and
indeed
in
our
own
country
we
are
witnessing
an
example
of
this
very
thing
religion
has
led
to
widespread
hypocrisy
our
religious
influences
have
created
a
race
of
men
mentally
docile
and
obedient
to
the
dictates
of
tyrannical
ecclesiasticism
it
has
created
a
fear
of
truth
and
our
minds
are
still
brutish
and
puerile
in
our
methods
of
reasoning
credulity
has
led
to
stultification
and
stultification
of
the
mind
is
the
bitter
fruit
which
we
have
been
reaping
for
thousands
of
years
there
are
probably
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
in
these
united
states
that
give
to
their
creed
but
deep
in
the
recesses
of
their
minds
a
small
voice
cries
to
them
and
shames
them
for
as
soon
as
they
reason
they
become
sceptics
how
can
we
know
the
actual
number
of
earthlings
that
are
sceptics
it
is
impossible
in
our
present
state
of
development
religious
persecution
today
is
just
as
active
as
it
was
during
the
middle
ages
surely
a
man
is
not
burned
at
the
stake
for
his
scepticism
in
this
age
but
is
he
not
done
to
death
if
the
grocer
the
butcher
the
doctor
the
lawyer
the
scholar
the
business
man
were
to
boldly
announce
his
scepticism
what
would
happen
to
him
the
answer
is
well
known
to
all
immediately
each
of
his
religious
customers
would
take
it
upon
himself
to
act
as
a
personal
inquisition
the
sceptic
would
be
shunned
socially
he
would
be
ignored
his
wares
would
be
sought
after
elsewhere
and
he
would
suffer
his
wife
his
family
his
children
would
suffer
with
him
for
our
economic
scheme
makes
the
sceptic
dependent
upon
the
whims
of
the
majority
believers
he
is
forced
to
hold
his
tongue
or
else
is
tortured
are
not
the
wants
of
his
family
the
hunger
and
ostracism
torture
thus
thousands
are
forced
into
hypocrisy
many
others
although
they
have
outgrown
all
fear
of
the
god
of
orthodoxy
the
fear
of
the
god
of
social
pressure
remains
there
are
embodied
in
all
creeds
three
human
impulses
fear
conceit
and
hatred
and
religion
has
given
an
air
of
respectability
to
these
passions
religion
is
a
malignant
disease
born
of
fear
a
cancer
which
has
been
eating
into
the
vitals
of
everything
that
is
worth
while
in
our
civilization
and
by
its
growth
obstructing
those
advances
which
make
for
a
more
healthful
life
morally
and
intellectually
socially
and
historically
religion
has
been
shown
to
be
a
pernicious
influence
some
of
these
influences
falling
into
these
classifications
have
been
considered
in
previous
chapters
the
modern
christian
in
his
amusing
ignorance
asserts
that
christianity
is
now
mild
and
rationalistic
ignoring
the
fact
that
all
its
mildness
and
rationalism
is
due
to
the
teaching
of
men
who
in
their
own
day
were
persecuted
by
all
orthodox
christians
historically
churches
have
stood
on
the
side
of
the
powers
that
be
they
have
defended
slavery
or
have
held
their
tongues
about
it
they
have
maintained
serfdom
and
kept
serfs
they
have
opposed
every
movement
undertaken
for
the
liberation
of
the
masses
of
men
the
ideals
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
are
the
creations
of
the
camps
of
their
enemies
of
the
rationalists
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
liberals
and
socialists
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
have
defended
and
condoned
the
industrial
exploitation
of
children
they
have
fought
bitterly
the
enfranchisement
of
women
they
have
justified
unjust
war
they
have
fought
with
book
and
bill
and
candle
and
fagot
every
new
great
step
in
the
advancement
of
science
from
gravitation
to
evolution
wardens
ever
since
constantine
gave
the
schools
of
antiquity
into
the
keeping
of
the
christian
bishops
of
the
education
of
the
people
they
have
fought
with
all
their
power
the
establishment
of
free
public
schools
and
the
spread
of
literacy
and
knowledge
among
the
people
kallen
why
religion
if
christianity
has
made
any
progress
in
the
assimilation
of
doctrines
that
are
less
barbarous
than
heretofore
they
have
been
effected
in
spite
of
the
most
vigorous
resistance
and
solely
as
a
result
of
the
onslaught
of
freethinkers
throughout
the
ages
when
a
thinking
man
had
questioned
the
how
and
why
of
any
secular
problem
so
long
as
that
problem
had
no
direct
or
indirect
bearing
upon
religion
or
upon
any
branch
of
knowledge
that
was
assumed
to
be
infallibly
foretold
in
the
bible
that
man
was
unmolested
the
problems
falling
into
the
above
classification
were
extremely
small
due
to
the
strongly
defended
theological
lunacy
that
asserted
itself
in
the
declaration
that
all
knowledge
both
spiritual
and
material
was
contained
in
the
bible
as
interpreted
by
the
church
man
however
when
he
broached
his
religious
doubts
was
regarded
as
the
most
sinful
of
beings
and
it
was
forbidden
him
to
question
and
yield
to
the
conclusions
that
his
mind
evolved
think
of
the
irony
and
tragedy
of
this
of
the
human
mind
there
is
one
characteristic
that
man
prides
himself
as
having
apart
from
all
lower
animals
his
ability
to
reason
and
to
think
is
it
his
superior
musculature
and
brute
strength
that
has
placed
man
upon
his
present
pinnacle
of
advanced
civilization
or
is
it
his
mental
development
his
mind
that
has
taught
him
to
harness
the
forces
of
nature
has
not
his
mind
so
his
movements
that
he
has
enslaved
those
forces
of
nature
to
be
his
aid
and
yet
if
mind
is
one
thing
that
has
enabled
man
to
pull
himself
out
of
the
morass
of
brute
life
why
has
it
been
that
man
himself
has
been
so
persistently
decrying
and
degrading
the
efforts
of
that
mind
the
answer
is
that
religion
has
provided
the
shackles
and
securely
and
jealously
enslaved
the
mind
with
the
aid
of
his
religious
beliefs
man
has
been
ensnared
into
a
mental
prison
in
which
he
has
been
an
all
too
willing
captive
surely
it
is
easier
to
believe
than
to
think
napoleon
himself
a
sceptic
was
cognizant
of
this
slave
philosophy
what
is
it
he
is
reported
to
have
asked
that
makes
the
poor
man
think
it
is
quite
natural
that
there
are
fires
in
my
castle
when
he
is
dying
of
cold
that
i
have
ten
coats
in
my
wardrobe
while
he
goes
naked
that
at
each
of
my
meals
enough
is
served
to
feed
his
family
for
a
week
it
is
simply
religion
which
tells
him
that
in
another
life
i
shall
be
only
his
equal
and
that
he
actually
has
more
chance
of
being
happy
than
i
yes
we
must
see
to
it
that
the
doors
of
the
churches
are
open
to
all
and
that
it
does
not
cost
the
poor
man
much
to
have
prayers
said
on
his
tomb
how
well
the
ecclesiastical
psychologists
have
grasped
this
fact
and
how
well
they
have
fashioned
a
strong
chain
for
the
mind
out
of
this
weakness
of
human
minds
church
and
government
have
been
well
aware
of
this
psychology
and
have
fought
constantly
the
spread
of
freethought
literature
to
the
masses
professor
bury
in
his
history
of
freedom
of
thought
speaking
of
england
tells
us
if
we
take
the
cases
in
which
the
civil
authorities
have
intervened
to
repress
the
publication
of
unorthodox
opinions
during
the
last
two
centuries
we
find
that
the
object
has
always
been
to
prevent
the
spread
of
free
thought
among
the
masses
think
but
a
moment
how
well
the
above
is
borne
out
by
the
attitude
of
the
church
in
the
stand
that
it
took
during
the
middle
ages
when
she
prohibited
the
reading
of
the
bible
by
any
person
except
her
clergy
when
she
prohibited
the
printing
of
all
books
except
those
that
she
approved
of
books
that
minutely
agreed
in
all
details
with
the
phantastic
fables
of
her
bible
were
the
only
ones
allowed
to
be
printed
the
church
also
strenuously
objected
to
the
printing
of
bibles
in
the
languages
of
the
masses
that
most
efficient
shackle
to
the
mind
that
precept
that
there
was
no
knowledge
whether
material
or
spiritual
that
was
not
contained
in
the
bible
how
strenuously
the
church
upheld
that
doctrine
and
in
our
own
day
the
ridiculous
assumption
that
mysteries
a
special
form
of
ignorance
are
the
special
province
of
the
church
considering
these
few
examples
as
well
as
all
ecclesiastical
endeavor
no
rational
mind
can
escape
the
fact
that
that
primeval
curse
religion
has
had
for
its
object
down
through
the
centuries
the
sadistic
desire
to
enslave
and
trample
on
the
mind
of
man
it
has
been
a
defensive
measure
on
the
part
of
the
church
for
she
well
recognizes
that
once
the
mind
is
free
it
will
free
itself
of
the
shackles
of
religion
also
nor
is
this
all
i
execrate
the
enslavement
of
the
mind
of
our
young
children
by
the
ecclesiastics
is
anything
so
pitiful
to
behold
as
the
firm
grasp
that
the
church
places
on
the
mind
of
the
youngest
of
children
children
at
play
children
of
four
and
five
years
of
age
will
be
heard
to
mention
with
fearful
tones
various
religious
rites
such
as
baptism
and
confirmation
and
to
perform
in
their
manner
these
rites
with
their
dolls
fear
fear
instilled
into
the
minds
of
the
impressionable
children
think
of
the
degradation
that
the
ecclesiastics
practice
when
they
insist
that
from
the
time
a
child
is
out
of
its
infancy
its
instruction
shall
be
placed
in
their
hands
they
take
the
most
precious
possession
of
man
his
mind
and
mould
it
to
their
desire
the
mind
of
a
child
is
plastic
it
is
like
a
moist
piece
of
clay
and
they
mould
it
and
form
it
to
their
desire
warped
and
poured
into
the
ecclesiastic
mould
of
fear
the
mind
of
the
child
becomes
set
and
fixed
with
the
years
then
it
is
too
late
for
rational
thinking
as
far
as
religious
matters
go
the
mind
of
the
adult
is
firmly
set
in
the
form
that
the
ecclesiastic
has
fashioned
for
him
in
his
youth
it
is
impossible
for
the
adult
so
taught
to
reason
clearly
and
rationally
concerning
his
religion
the
mould
is
too
strong
the
clay
has
set
reason
can
not
penetrate
into
that
hardened
form
that
is
why
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
adult
who
has
been
exposed
to
this
mental
moulding
from
his
infancy
to
break
away
from
the
fears
and
superstitions
learned
on
his
mother
knee
if
christianity
hebrewism
mohammedanism
or
any
other
creed
is
true
its
truth
must
be
more
apparent
at
the
age
of
than
it
is
at
the
age
of
five
why
does
the
ecclesiastic
not
leave
off
his
advances
until
the
child
reaches
a
mature
age
an
age
when
he
can
reason
then
if
theism
is
true
he
can
accept
it
with
a
reasoning
mind
not
a
blindly
faithful
mind
the
theist
realizes
however
that
belief
is
at
one
pole
reason
at
the
other
belief
creed
religion
are
ideations
of
the
primitive
mind
and
the
mind
of
the
child
reason
is
the
product
of
mature
thought
schopenhauer
remarked
that
the
power
of
religious
dogma
when
inculcated
early
is
such
as
to
stifle
conscience
compassion
and
finally
every
feeling
of
humanity
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
if
the
clergy
would
but
leave
their
tainted
hands
off
the
minds
of
our
children
until
they
would
have
reached
a
mature
age
there
would
be
no
religious
instinct
religious
instinct
is
a
myth
give
me
but
two
generations
of
men
who
have
not
been
subjected
to
this
religious
influence
in
childhood
and
there
will
be
a
race
of
atheists
the
ecclesiastic
has
from
earliest
times
taken
the
standpoint
that
the
masses
of
people
are
of
crude
susceptibility
and
clumsy
intelligence
sordid
in
their
pursuits
and
sunk
in
drudgery
and
religion
provides
the
only
means
of
proclaiming
and
making
them
feel
the
high
import
of
life
thus
the
theist
is
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
theism
is
a
hypothesis
which
among
other
things
attempts
an
explanation
of
the
universe
the
theist
recognizes
a
creator
who
created
the
universe
and
is
responsible
for
its
operation
the
atheist
clearly
perceives
that
the
assumption
of
a
creator
does
not
advance
him
in
the
slightest
degree
towards
the
solution
of
the
mysterious
problem
of
the
universe
the
question
still
admits
of
no
answer
who
created
the
creator
it
is
an
absurd
answer
to
reply
that
the
creator
created
himself
yet
even
if
this
is
granted
may
not
the
universe
have
created
itself
if
the
theist
puts
forward
the
statement
that
god
has
always
existed
the
atheist
may
well
reply
that
if
god
has
always
existed
why
can
he
not
say
that
the
universe
has
always
existed
the
atheist
is
not
concerned
with
the
creation
of
the
universe
to
him
it
presents
a
problem
which
is
beyond
the
comprehension
of
his
present
mental
capacities
he
comprehends
the
fact
of
its
being
and
that
is
as
far
as
he
or
any
rational
mind
can
go
atheism
confines
itself
to
a
refutation
of
theism
and
avoids
the
theistic
fallacy
of
assuming
without
any
proofs
or
reasonable
arguments
to
substantiate
the
assumption
of
an
intelligent
omnipotent
omniscient
anthropomorphic
and
anthropocentric
creator
the
theistic
assumption
has
but
retarded
the
advance
of
practical
knowledge
and
prepared
the
soil
for
superstition
and
the
countless
terrors
of
religious
beliefs
atheism
as
far
as
a
rational
explanation
of
the
universe
is
covered
although
it
does
not
offer
an
explanation
of
the
ultimate
or
the
riddle
of
the
universe
does
insist
that
any
view
held
be
one
that
shall
be
based
on
truth
and
conformity
to
reality
it
further
maintains
that
if
a
view
be
propagated
it
should
be
held
in
the
same
position
that
any
scientific
proposition
is
held
it
must
be
open
to
verification
if
it
be
verified
as
any
scientific
theory
is
verified
it
will
be
accepted
in
part
or
in
toto
and
be
proven
to
be
true
or
displaced
by
a
closer
approximation
to
the
truth
to
certain
types
of
men
there
may
be
a
negative
attitude
expressed
in
this
credo
which
leaves
the
mind
unsatisfied
this
is
but
an
emotional
bias
and
has
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
attainment
of
truth
a
delusion
may
be
more
comforting
than
the
truth
but
that
does
not
necessitate
the
conclusion
that
a
delusion
may
be
of
more
ultimate
benefit
than
a
constant
striving
for
the
truth
it
has
often
been
said
that
atheism
in
that
negative
aspect
places
a
question
mark
upon
our
problems
however
while
a
question
mark
may
indicate
a
negative
value
it
may
also
prove
to
be
a
mental
provocative
a
period
placed
at
the
end
of
a
problem
denotes
that
it
has
been
definitely
solved
in
connection
with
the
origin
of
the
universe
no
period
can
be
placed
at
the
end
of
that
problem
and
since
we
are
awaiting
the
solution
it
is
much
more
to
the
interest
of
further
advances
to
place
the
question
mark
there
than
to
consider
the
matter
solved
surely
sufficient
instances
have
been
enumerated
in
this
discussion
to
show
the
stultification
and
retardation
that
ensues
when
an
institution
maintains
an
insistence
that
a
problem
be
held
to
conform
in
any
of
its
explanatory
aspects
to
a
preconceived
infallible
statement
or
considers
a
problem
not
to
exist
or
closes
its
eyes
to
the
inconsistencies
in
an
explanation
which
is
being
maintained
by
mental
persuasion
and
force
when
the
bible
was
considered
as
containing
the
answer
to
all
our
problems
we
have
seen
what
the
result
was
if
atheism
places
a
question
mark
upon
the
problem
of
the
universe
it
does
so
in
a
constructive
manner
for
that
mark
points
to
the
direction
in
which
a
logical
solution
may
be
possible
such
is
the
mental
attitude
of
the
scientist
he
places
an
interrogation
point
upon
his
problems
and
that
mark
is
the
impetus
the
mental
stimulus
that
leads
him
on
to
take
infinite
pains
in
his
labors
and
as
time
passes
each
question
mark
is
replaced
by
knowledge
it
is
knowledge
and
knowledge
alone
reason
not
faith
that
furnishes
the
period
it
was
haeckel
who
asserted
that
the
most
dangerous
of
the
three
great
enemies
of
reason
and
knowledge
is
not
malice
but
ignorance
or
perhaps
indolence
the
question
mark
as
applied
to
a
problem
that
is
recognizably
not
solved
is
a
signpost
to
the
knowledge
that
time
must
bring
the
spurious
period
placed
at
the
end
of
a
problem
is
the
death
warrant
for
that
problem
and
there
it
must
lie
devitalized
by
ignorance
and
indolence
it
has
often
been
affirmed
that
what
we
see
in
this
universe
is
phenomena
and
all
explanations
but
interpret
the
manifestations
of
these
phenomena
what
is
in
back
of
and
beyond
these
phenomena
may
never
be
known
and
if
it
be
known
would
be
of
no
further
use
to
us
it
is
equally
as
true
that
if
we
but
see
phenomena
and
our
mental
capacities
deny
us
a
conception
of
the
reality
beyond
phenomena
yet
we
have
a
growing
knowledge
of
the
laws
that
govern
these
phenomena
and
it
is
a
comprehensive
knowledge
of
these
invariable
laws
that
govern
the
universe
that
are
of
universal
value
these
laws
have
been
ascertained
by
the
questioning
mental
attitude
and
not
by
a
futile
reliance
on
faith
human
knowledge
has
expanded
immensely
in
the
last
fifty
years
and
this
by
the
purely
scientific
method
the
materialistic
method
and
the
questioning
attitude
the
value
of
these
findings
when
they
can
be
converted
into
practical
applications
in
industry
are
well
known
to
all
we
have
added
nothing
to
our
store
of
knowledge
except
by
the
exercise
of
our
mentality
and
reason
the
application
of
the
scientific
method
to
the
workings
of
the
mind
has
made
more
progress
in
explaining
the
mind
in
the
brief
period
of
fifty
years
than
philosophical
deductions
had
made
in
the
past
two
thousand
years
every
new
fact
that
has
been
discovered
has
fitted
into
the
mechanistic
scheme
of
the
universe
and
not
one
new
fact
has
been
disclosed
that
suggested
anything
beyond
nature
the
theistic
interpretation
of
the
universe
has
been
completely
discredited
by
the
scientific
investigations
science
has
brought
to
the
confines
of
invariable
laws
multitudes
of
problems
that
had
hitherto
been
supposed
to
point
to
spiritual
interference
theology
has
been
driven
out
of
the
open
spaces
of
reason
and
still
persists
in
clinging
to
the
twilight
zone
of
the
present
unknown
only
to
be
driven
from
its
precarious
position
constantly
by
our
increasing
knowledge
and
with
increasing
rapidity
from
shadow
to
shadow
there
has
been
an
increasing
tendency
shown
by
physicists
to
consider
that
matter
and
energy
are
interchangeable
and
that
the
one
ultimate
reality
is
energy
if
this
be
so
we
are
still
dealing
with
an
ultimate
that
is
a
material
reality
the
nobel
prize
in
medicine
for
the
year
was
awarded
to
two
british
investigators
sir
charles
scott
sherrington
professor
of
physiology
at
oxford
university
and
edgar
douglas
adrian
professor
of
physiology
at
cambridge
university
their
researches
seem
to
have
settled
definitely
a
problem
that
has
long
been
a
bone
for
contention
nerve
energy
has
been
shown
conclusively
to
be
of
an
electric
type
of
energy
the
old
question
of
whether
mind
was
part
of
the
material
world
has
been
shown
by
these
experiments
to
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
there
is
no
duality
mind
and
matter
are
one
and
mind
is
but
a
special
property
of
highly
specialized
matter
it
is
with
a
great
deal
of
regret
that
the
freethinker
contemplates
the
attitude
of
such
scientists
as
jeans
eddington
millikan
and
the
philosopher
professor
whitehead
their
hesitation
to
divorce
themselves
completely
from
all
conceptions
of
a
supernatural
force
leads
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
an
acquaintance
with
the
writings
of
einstein
brings
one
the
certainty
that
he
is
as
much
in
accordance
with
the
attitude
of
freethought
as
is
the
most
militant
atheist
the
cosmic
sense
and
totality
of
existence
of
einstein
is
as
far
removed
from
the
conception
of
a
yahveh
as
is
the
mentality
of
an
australian
black
man
from
that
of
einstein
mental
grasp
similarly
with
the
cosmic
consciousness
expressed
in
the
writings
of
jeans
eddington
and
whitehead
with
characteristic
disregard
for
the
truth
certain
modern
theologians
have
grasped
this
cringing
attitude
of
the
men
and
have
stressed
their
viewpoints
by
a
dishonest
interpretation
that
these
men
actually
give
a
scientific
certitude
to
their
own
theologic
creeds
and
dogmas
nothing
can
be
further
from
the
truth
the
freethinker
would
have
each
theologian
who
tells
his
adherents
that
these
men
lend
credence
to
their
beliefs
to
consider
the
following
if
the
men
would
be
asked
if
they
believed
in
a
deity
who
actively
interposed
his
will
and
influence
in
the
lives
of
men
as
is
commonly
expressed
in
the
term
providence
if
they
ascribed
to
the
belief
in
personal
immorality
if
they
themselves
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
soul
if
they
ascribed
to
the
statement
that
prayer
influenced
the
opinion
of
an
being
to
intercede
for
them
in
their
problems
and
grief
if
they
believed
that
the
bible
was
a
book
dictated
by
god
or
that
a
god
caused
to
be
written
for
him
his
revelations
that
heaven
and
hell
exist
in
the
meaning
that
theologians
assure
their
adherents
that
they
do
that
sin
and
morality
is
what
theologians
still
hold
it
to
be
that
there
has
been
a
fall
and
therefore
the
necessity
for
a
redemption
of
man
and
that
creed
and
dogma
are
necessary
factors
in
the
worship
of
a
deity
what
would
their
answers
be
eddington
jeans
einstein
and
whitehead
would
answer
these
questions
exactly
as
would
the
most
militant
atheists
the
mental
attitude
of
these
men
can
best
be
explained
when
one
considers
certain
similarities
between
theological
asceticism
and
scientific
asceticism
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
freethinker
clearly
to
point
out
why
this
confusion
has
arisen
during
the
ages
of
faith
the
world
beheld
a
swarm
of
men
and
women
who
retired
from
the
grim
realities
of
a
world
which
at
that
time
was
made
abhorrent
to
all
sensitive
men
by
the
most
exacting
insistence
of
theologians
that
faith
was
the
all
necessary
ingredient
of
life
and
that
closed
its
eyes
completely
to
the
degrading
actualities
of
life
that
this
insistence
led
to
multitudes
of
men
retired
to
the
desert
and
to
the
protective
walls
of
monasteries
there
by
constant
privations
fastings
continual
prayer
flagellation
and
introspection
they
spent
their
lives
these
ascetic
individuals
by
these
means
were
enabled
to
enter
what
may
be
called
a
theologic
trance
and
their
subsequent
hallucinations
illusions
and
delusions
gave
to
them
what
they
deemed
to
be
a
transcendental
insight
into
the
construction
of
the
universe
and
what
was
expected
between
fallen
and
debased
man
and
his
omnipotent
creator
these
men
keenly
apprehended
what
some
today
in
a
gentler
age
have
called
cosmic
consciousness
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
these
scientists
have
applied
such
a
rigor
to
their
lives
what
is
meant
to
be
stated
is
that
these
men
by
their
research
and
comprehension
of
the
vastness
of
the
universe
stand
in
awe
and
fear
before
this
aspect
modern
astrophysics
to
one
who
attempts
to
comprehend
its
vastness
imposes
on
the
mind
but
a
faint
comprehension
of
the
vastness
of
the
universe
in
space
time
and
size
but
imposes
a
deep
conviction
of
the
infinitesimal
meaning
of
our
planet
earth
both
as
to
size
and
its
relation
to
the
millions
of
related
heavenly
bodies
the
evolution
of
man
on
our
planet
in
this
broad
conception
of
space
and
time
is
most
infinitesimal
it
has
been
just
a
few
hours
ago
in
this
widened
conception
of
time
that
halley
comet
was
excommunicated
from
the
skies
by
pope
calixitus
iii
who
looked
upon
this
comet
as
one
of
magnitude
and
from
the
tail
of
which
was
flung
down
upon
the
earth
disease
pestilence
and
war
most
certainly
the
minds
of
jeans
and
eddington
carry
in
their
recesses
a
vast
amount
of
knowledge
that
was
not
common
to
men
living
in
the
year
in
which
the
comet
caused
such
consternation
much
as
one
admires
the
superiority
of
the
minds
of
these
physicists
yet
one
can
not
help
but
think
that
if
our
present
rate
of
progress
meets
no
serious
obstacle
then
in
another
five
hundred
years
the
attitude
of
awe
of
jeans
and
eddington
towards
the
vastness
of
our
universe
will
be
held
in
some
similar
position
to
which
jeans
and
eddington
now
hold
the
misguided
conception
of
halley
comet
in
the
year
the
mind
of
man
is
just
beginning
to
emerge
from
its
swaddling
clothes
and
we
can
not
assume
to
judge
what
its
broadest
capabilities
may
be
certain
great
modern
minds
therefore
when
they
contemplate
this
vastness
of
astrophysics
are
apt
to
dwell
a
bit
too
literally
on
the
music
of
the
heavenly
spheres
and
under
the
influence
of
these
celestial
harmonies
fall
into
the
trance
of
scientific
asceticism
men
who
can
no
longer
seriously
hold
to
a
belief
in
an
anthropomorphic
god
the
soul
and
immortality
are
apt
to
allow
themselves
when
in
this
mood
to
emotionalize
their
knowledge
and
these
same
men
are
the
ones
who
would
in
their
scientific
endeavors
be
the
first
to
eliminate
all
emotions
from
their
reasoning
efforts
in
their
laboratories
one
seems
justified
therefore
in
stating
that
this
conception
of
cosmic
consciousness
is
but
another
instance
of
the
mere
illusions
of
a
craving
heart
discussing
the
question
as
to
whether
science
and
religion
conflict
the
physicist
professor
bazzoni
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
in
a
recent
work
energy
and
matter
makes
the
following
pointed
comment
some
scientists
resort
to
metaphysics
and
make
contact
with
a
kind
of
mysticism
which
may
be
taken
for
a
religious
belief
at
precisely
that
point
where
ignorance
prevents
further
progress
along
sound
scientific
lines
the
primitive
medicine
man
appealed
to
the
gods
to
explain
the
precipitation
of
rain
and
the
phase
changes
of
the
moon
and
some
modern
scientists
appeal
to
metaphysics
and
mysticism
to
explain
the
limits
of
the
infinite
and
the
nature
of
electricity
he
further
cautions
theologians
against
placing
undue
emphasis
on
the
opinions
of
scientists
when
they
express
their
minds
on
religious
topics
and
he
remarks
they
the
laity
should
realize
that
in
the
spiritual
field
the
opinion
of
an
eminent
scientist
has
exactly
the
same
weight
as
the
opinion
of
any
other
cultivated
and
thoughtful
individual
when
the
scientist
examines
with
the
impartial
mind
of
the
laboratory
the
science
of
the
origin
of
religious
beliefs
and
delves
into
the
complicated
intricacies
of
religious
history
he
becomes
as
convinced
as
any
other
thoughtful
individual
that
the
facts
of
science
and
history
are
deadly
to
religion
moreover
as
man
contemplates
the
construction
and
forces
at
work
in
the
universe
he
still
must
exclaim
end
beginning
or
purpose
it
knows
not
of
the
theologians
are
devoting
a
great
deal
of
their
time
to
the
writings
of
physicists
who
venture
into
the
field
of
theology
it
may
be
that
in
this
manner
they
can
divert
attention
from
the
drastic
findings
concerning
all
religious
beliefs
that
the
anthropologists
and
psychologists
are
patiently
accumulating
many
physicists
and
biologists
like
pupin
millikan
oliver
lodge
arthur
thomson
and
henry
fairfield
osborn
have
recently
blossomed
forth
as
liberal
theologians
they
are
still
emotionally
attached
to
the
older
religious
faith
they
are
aware
that
modern
physics
and
biology
have
abandoned
doctrines
that
once
were
hostile
to
religious
claims
they
therefore
proclaim
that
there
is
no
further
conflict
between
religion
and
science
in
so
doing
however
they
show
themselves
abysmally
ignorant
of
all
that
anthropology
and
psychology
have
done
to
study
religion
and
religious
man
scientifically
they
show
their
ignorance
of
the
philosophy
that
has
built
upon
such
data
they
do
not
realize
that
the
conflict
between
religious
faith
and
science
is
no
longer
with
a
scientific
explanation
of
the
world
but
with
a
scientific
explanation
of
religion
randall
and
randall
religion
and
the
modern
world
the
cultured
greeks
and
romans
had
their
omnipotent
gods
and
these
have
long
ago
died
a
death
of
ridicule
at
a
time
when
beauty
and
sculpture
were
at
their
height
the
religion
of
these
ancient
artists
was
absurd
similarly
with
some
of
our
modern
scientists
their
religion
has
not
kept
pace
with
their
intellect
their
emotions
have
overbalanced
their
reason
in
this
field
professor
levy
of
the
university
of
london
tersely
remarks
the
assertion
of
contemporary
scientists
who
state
that
the
universe
is
a
fickle
collection
of
indeterminate
happenings
and
a
great
thought
in
the
mind
of
its
architect
a
pure
mathematician
serves
merely
to
divert
the
activity
of
the
scientific
brain
from
its
concentration
on
the
contradictions
and
confusions
of
the
all
too
real
outward
world
to
a
state
of
passive
and
unreal
contemplation
levy
the
universe
of
science
among
the
theologians
some
at
least
have
learned
the
futility
of
waxing
indignant
at
each
new
scientific
hypothesis
that
encroached
as
they
thought
within
their
domain
a
great
many
liberal
theologians
have
as
yet
not
learned
the
extreme
danger
to
their
theology
in
grasping
at
some
concept
of
science
that
for
the
present
moment
does
not
appear
to
be
detrimental
to
their
theology
or
as
they
think
seems
to
bolster
up
their
particular
creed
the
enthusiasm
aroused
in
certain
theological
circles
by
recent
developments
in
mathematical
physics
states
otto
seems
to
me
to
indicate
just
one
thing
that
these
theologians
felt
themselves
to
be
in
so
desperate
a
state
that
a
floating
straw
assumed
the
appearance
of
a

i
am
of
the
opinion
that
all
persons
who
would
work
for
a
more
decent
and
happy
existence
for
themselves
and
for
their
fellows
must
turn
their
backs
upon
religion
just
to
the
extent
that
religious
leadership
seeks
spiritual
renewal
in
these
hallucinations
of
despair
wieman
macintosh
and
otto
is
there
a
god
it
is
only
proper
to
point
out
that
what
certain
emancipated
minds
are
trying
to
reconstruct
as
a
basis
of
religious
belief
is
not
what
is
held
by
the
masses
as
their
conception
of
religion
in
a
recent
clear
and
frank
statement
of
the
religious
revolution
john
herman
randall
and
john
herman
randall
state
such
beliefs
even
so
fundamental
a
one
as
belief
in
god
must
stand
their
chances
with
the
philosophic
interpretation
men
give
their
experience
the
really
revolutionary
effect
of
the
scientific
faith
so
far
as
religion
is
concerned
has
been
not
its
new
view
of
the
world
but
its
new
view
of
religion
reinterpretations
of
religious
belief
have
been
unimportant
compared
with
reinterpretations
of
religion
itself
for
those
who
have
come
to
share
the
scientific
even
more
for
those
who
have
absorbed
the
spirit
of
scientific
inquiry
it
has
been
impossible
to
view
religion
as
a
divine
revelation
entrusted
to
man
it
has
even
been
impossible
to
see
it
as
a
relation
between
man
and
a
cosmic
deity
religion
has
rather
appeared
a
human
enterprise
an
organization
of
human
life
an
experience
a
social
bond
and
an
inspiration
randall
and
randall
religion
and
the
modern
world
to
the
man
who
literally
entreats
his
deity
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
grant
us
our
daily
bread
the
above
reinterpretation
of
what
is
meant
by
religion
can
have
no
meaning
to
the
cultivated
mind
that
comprehends
what
is
meant
the
above
interpretation
is
what
he
conceives
of
as
his
social
secular
activities
for
the
betterment
of
his
fellowmen
a
living
philosophy
of
life
is
a
much
better
name
for
this
attitude
than
is
the
misnomer
religion
and
avoids
a
great
deal
of
confusion
some
of
our
scientists
on
a
holiday
as
they
have
been
facetiously
called
when
they
stepped
into
a
field
in
which
they
had
not
become
well
acquainted
with
the
ground
have
proceeded
to
lend
assurance
that
god
by
subtracting
so
drastically
from
what
is
generally
attributed
to
the
conception
of
god
that
there
is
nothing
much
left
to
what
they
conceive
as
what
god
they
have
stripped
the
conception
of
what
has
been
heretofore
regarded
as
fundamental
namely
the
conception
that
god
is
a
superhuman
personality
or
mind
in
whitehead
philosophy
god
is
spoken
of
as
god
is
not
concrete
but
he
is
the
ground
for
concrete
actuality
i
believe
such
confusion
of
language
may
have
been
in
the
mind
of
otto
when
he
remarked
some
persons
endeavor
more
than
ever
to
make
necessary
distinctions
to
keep
meanings
as
clear
as
possible
and
to
have
an
eye
on
the
tendency
of
language
to
become
its
own
object
other
persons
repudiate
these
obligations
they
act
as
if
it
were
a
virtue
to
love
darkness
rather
than
light
if
your
intentions
are
good
under
their
manipulations
conceptions
are
dimmed
or
replaced
by
vague
intimations
one
boundary
line
after
another
is
obliterated
until
the
whole
substance
of
things
swims
in
mists
history
has
illustrated
that
the
greatest
source
of
evil
on
this
planet
has
arisen
from
the
fact
that
physical
phenomena
for
which
our
limited
mental
capacities
were
not
able
to
formulate
a
logical
solution
were
ascribed
to
preternatural
causes
from
this
original
stem
arose
religion
and
the
church
the
two
greatest
obstacles
which
have
been
a
burden
to
mankind
for
years
and
a
barrier
to
all
progress
which
has
made
life
endurable
and
desirable
the
lower
man
is
in
the
scale
of
civilization
the
more
does
he
call
in
the
supernatural
to
explain
all
the
happenings
and
experiences
of
his
life
when
he
had
been
beset
by
an
intellectual
failure
he
had
been
thrown
back
to
religion
lacking
the
courage
and
mental
capacity
to
proceed
further
against
obstacles
he
succumbed
to
the
drug
of
religious
explanations
the
need
was
not
for
a
narcotic
but
for
a
stimulant
the
mental
stimulant
was
provided
for
man
in
the
form
of
science
science
is
but
organized
knowledge
and
it
is
this
knowledge
that
has
elevated
man
to
the
position
where
he
is
now
his
own
god
when
difficulties
confront
him
in
this
age
he
blames
them
upon
his
own
ignorance
and
incompetence
and
when
he
sets
about
to
overcome
these
difficulties
he
does
not
rely
on
divine
revelation
or
supernatural
aid
or
on
miracles
he
relies
on
his
reason
he
knows
that
when
a
problem
eludes
his
mental
capacity
it
is
not
the
supernatural
which
eludes
him
but
some
natural
force
some
law
which
he
has
not
been
able
to
grasp
as
yet
there
is
no
resignation
in
this
attitude
only
resolute
peaceful
patience
the
problem
that
he
can
not
solve
at
present
will
yield
to
his
reason
eventually
the
ecclesiastic
is
well
aware
that
science
is
his
natural
and
implacable
enemy
he
knows
that
every
time
the
bounds
of
exact
knowledge
are
widened
the
domain
of
religion
is
narrowed
man
knowledge
of
the
universe
is
still
incomplete
but
it
is
certainly
more
complete
than
it
was
fifty
years
ago
and
when
we
consider
what
that
knowledge
was
a
few
thousand
years
ago
it
is
no
breach
of
logic
to
state
that
all
natural
processes
in
the
course
of
time
will
be
brought
into
the
confines
of
invariable
laws
sir
arthur
keith
clearly
states
the
ancient
seeker
to
explain
the
kingdom
of
life
with
man
as
its
regent
had
to
call
in
the
miracle
of
creation
the
modern
seeker
finds
that
although
life
has
the
appearance
of
the
miraculous
yet
all
its
manifestations
can
be
studied
and
measured
and
that
there
is
a
machinery
at
work
in
every
living
thing
which
shapes
evolves
and
creates
his
inquiries
have
led
him
to
replace
the
miracle
of
creation
by
the
laws
of
evolution
whichever
department
of
the
realm
of
nature
the
man
of
science
has
chosen
for
investigation
the
result
has
always
been
the
same
the
supernatural
has
given
place
to
the
natural
superstition
is
succeeded
by
reason
the
world
has
never
had
such
armies
of
truth
seekers
as
it
now
has
those
equipped
with
ladders
of
science
have
so
often
scaled
the
walls
which
surround
cities
of
ignorance
that
they
march
forward
in
the
sure
faith
that
none
of
nature
battlements
are
impregnable
in
the
last
analysis
if
we
reach
a
point
in
thinking
where
we
can
not
proceed
further
a
fathomless
landmark
must
we
revert
to
the
theological
error
of
thinking
and
assume
it
must
be
of
supernatural
character
because
the
unknown
in
the
past
has
been
assigned
to
the
supernatural
is
no
indication
for
us
also
in
the
present
age
to
relegate
the
unknown
to
divine
cause
it
is
unseemly
that
minds
that
have
emancipated
themselves
should
go
just
so
far
as
far
as
own
can
explain
the
unknown
and
when
their
limited
reason
can
go
no
further
to
revert
back
to
the
primitive
stage
where
solution
is
considered
impossible
to
man
save
it
be
revealed
to
him
by
god
if
man
mind
is
free
if
no
coercion
of
any
kind
is
placed
on
its
exercise
it
will
expand
and
unravel
what
at
present
is
still
fathomless
give
man
endless
centuries
and
ample
opportunities
and
he
will
unravel
the
miracles
of
development
and
growth
just
as
he
has
done
other
miracles
which
at
first
seemed
impossible
of
rational
solution
for
how
much
longer
will
man
be
a
slave
to
his
inferiority
complex
with
regard
to
his
own
rational
capacities
if
faith
is
vital
to
man
why
not
relate
it
to
that
which
at
least
holds
a
promise
of
solution
man
mind
has
not
as
yet
arrived
at
the
point
which
might
give
even
the
slightest
indication
of
its
ultimate
exhaustion
we
can
not
assume
the
knowledge
of
what
man
fullest
capacities
are
all
things
must
unravel
themselves
with
the
progress
of
his
mind
those
things
that
he
can
not
explain
now
he
must
not
assign
to
a
superhuman
force
man
must
use
his
reasoning
faculties
to
investigate
and
search
for
the
truth
so
that
these
unknown
may
become
part
of
the
known
again
to
quote
sir
arthur
keith
only
eighty
years
have
come
and
gone
since
the
anatomist
obtained
his
first
glimpse
of
the
structural
complexity
of
the
human
brain
it
will
take
him
eight
thousand
years
and
more
to
find
out
the
exact
part
played
by
every
departmental
unit
of
this
colossal
system
of
government
which
carries
on
the
mental
life
of
a
human
being
have
no
reason
to
think
there
is
anything
supernatural
in
its
as
our
knowledge
of
the
brain
accumulates
the
names
and
terms
we
now
use
will
give
place
to
others
which
have
a
more
precise
meaning
in
our
present
state
of
ignorance
we
have
to
use
familiar
and
loose
terms
to
explain
the
workings
of
the
brain
such
words
as
soul
spirit
heart
superstition
and
prejudice
these
manifestations
of
the
mind
will
be
dissected
and
made
understandable
science
has
as
yet
not
fully
explained
the
origin
of
life
on
earth
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
do
so
in
the
future
the
laws
governing
the
production
of
life
itself
are
under
investigation
in
the
laboratories
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
this
law
will
be
unraveled
at
some
future
date
it
will
be
interesting
for
our
posterity
to
witness
the
confusion
of
the
ecclesiastics
and
their
attempted
confirmation
of
this
fact
in
the
bible
their
finding
of
some
obscure
phrase
that
will
be
interpreted
by
them
as
a
prediction
of
the
fact
in
the
bible
the
theists
have
maintained
as
we
have
seen
many
false
beliefs
that
have
cost
the
lives
of
innumerable
men
and
suffering
incalculable
beliefs
which
they
themselves
have
subsequently
recognized
as
false
but
relinquished
only
by
the
onslaught
of
rising
secular
knowledge
it
was
the
ecclesiastic
who
pointed
to
the
phrase
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
and
the
various
precepts
that
have
been
enumerated
in
the
preceding
chapters
surely
sufficient
evidence
has
been
noted
to
convince
a
thinking
being
that
reason
is
a
better
guide
than
theism
belief
is
the
antithesis
of
reason
reason
is
rationality
religious
belief
is
clearly
mental
abnormality
if
a
religionist
is
asked
what
he
thinks
of
a
secular
institution
which
vigorously
condemns
and
persecutes
inquiry
experiment
and
truth
he
will
reply
with
the
logical
answer
when
it
is
pointed
out
to
him
that
religion
has
done
and
still
is
doing
this
he
will
hem
and
haw
until
he
manufactures
some
illogical
answer
it
has
been
stated
that
the
more
we
think
the
less
we
believe
and
that
the
less
we
think
the
more
we
believe
the
christian
will
analyze
the
creed
of
the
mohammedan
and
find
it
ridiculous
the
mohammedan
analyzes
the
creed
of
the
christian
and
in
turn
finds
it
ridiculous
that
is
thinking
but
does
the
mohammedan
or
the
christian
analyze
as
critically
each
his
own
belief
will
he
endeavor
to
analyze
it
at
all
that
is
believing
the
ecclesiastic
concerns
himself
not
with
truth
or
knowledge
it
is
creed
which
is
his
shrine
he
definitely
is
at
war
with
knowledge
and
he
wants
to
learn
only
such
things
as
fit
in
with
his
preconceived
notions
and
prejudices
when
the
minds
of
men
are
from
infancy
perverted
with
these
ideals
how
can
mankind
build
a
virile
race
it
is
often
asserted
that
the
alleged
universality
of
the
belief
in
god
is
an
argument
for
its
truth
but
what
of
the
fact
that
men
had
everywhere
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
earth
was
flat
and
yet
a
wider
and
truer
knowledge
proved
that
universal
belief
to
be
false
in
the
discussion
of
witchcraft
it
has
been
shown
that
a
delusion
may
be
as
widespread
as
a
truth
during
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
the
spanish
moors
had
recognized
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
and
were
teaching
geography
from
globes
in
their
common
schools
rome
during
the
same
ages
was
asserting
in
all
its
absurdity
the
flatness
of
the
earth
it
was
not
until
almost
five
hundred
years
later
that
rome
was
forced
to
see
its
absurdity
and
then
only
when
the
enlightened
world
mocked
at
its
error
in
this
twentieth
century
certain
enlightened
men
are
teaching
the
absurdity
and
harmfulness
of
a
belief
in
a
deity
must
it
take
five
hundred
years
for
all
mankind
to
come
to
a
similar
conclusion
may
it
not
well
be
that
in
a
few
centuries
our
posterity
will
view
belief
in
a
deity
in
the
same
light
that
we
in
this
age
view
the
church
insistence
that
the
earth
was
flat
the
god
idea
has
been
one
of
the
most
divisive
and
notions
cherished
by
mankind
in
fact
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
idea
of
god
has
been
the
enemy
of
man
it
has
driven
multitudes
of
men
and
women
into
the
unnatural
asceticisms
and
wasted
lives
of
the
convent
and
abbey
it
has
taxed
the
economic
resources
of
every
nation
every
church
no
matter
of
what
creed
is
a
pathetic
monument
of
humanity
which
has
been
built
by
the
pennies
sweated
by
the
poor
and
wrested
from
them
by
fraudulent
promises
of
reward
appeals
to
fear
and
the
pathetic
human
tendency
to
sacrifice
the
theologians
have
in
their
arguments
resorted
to
philosophy
the
consequence
of
this
transference
of
the
idea
of
god
to
the
sphere
of
philosophy
is
the
curious
position
that
the
god
in
which
people
believe
is
not
the
god
whose
existence
is
made
the
product
of
an
experimental
argument
and
the
god
of
the
argument
is
not
the
god
of
belief
it
is
a
nice
question
remarks
walter
lippmann
whether
the
use
of
god
name
is
not
misleading
when
it
is
applied
by
modernists
to
ideas
so
remote
from
the
god
men
have
worshipped
plainly
the
modernist
churchman
does
not
believe
in
the
god
of
genesis
who
walked
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
called
for
adam
and
his
wife
who
had
hidden
themselves
behind
a
tree
nor
in
the
god
of
exodus
who
appeared
to
moses
and
aaron
and
seventy
of
the
elders
of
israel
standing
with
his
feet
upon
a
paved
walk
as
if
it
were
a
sapphire
stone
nor
even
in
the
god
of
the
chapter
of
isaiah
who
in
his
compassion
for
the
sheep
who
had
gone
astray
having
turned
everyone
to
his
own
way
laid
on
the
man
of
sorrows
the
iniquity
of
us
all
lippmann
a
preface
to
morals
it
is
one
kind
of
god
that
is
being
set
up
in
argument
and
it
is
really
another
god
that
is
being
depended
upon
and
believed
the
philosophical
conception
of
a
deity
that
may
be
in
control
of
phenomena
is
an
impersonal
physical
law
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
conception
of
a
personal
deity
to
whom
people
pray
for
active
intervention
in
their
troubles
religious
belief
is
a
monstrous
apparition
the
philosophy
of
atheism
is
a
solid
structure
laboriously
founded
on
solid
rock
the
philosophy
of
atheism
had
temporarily
failed
in
previous
ages
since
the
knowledge
of
those
ages
did
not
furnish
facts
enough
upon
which
to
build
at
the
present
although
our
knowledge
is
far
from
complete
and
the
surface
has
only
been
scratched
yet
sufficient
facts
have
been
unearthed
to
reveal
that
there
is
no
supernatural
and
the
greatest
hope
of
advancement
lies
in
the
philosophy
of
atheism
a
philosophy
that
builds
upon
a
foundation
of
purely
secular
thought
that
leaves
the
idea
of
god
completely
discarded
as
a
useless
and
false
relic
of
bygone
days
is
the
essence
of
atheism
atheism
is
more
than
the
speculative
philosophy
of
a
few
that
it
is
in
sober
truth
the
logical
outcome
of
mental
growth
so
far
as
any
phase
of
human
life
can
be
called
inevitable
atheism
may
lay
claim
to
being
inescapable
all
mental
growth
can
be
seen
leading
to
it
just
as
we
can
see
one
stage
of
social
development
giving
a
logical
starting
point
for
another
stage
and
which
could
have
been
foretold
had
our
knowledge
of
all
the
forces
in
operation
been
precise
enough
atheism
is
so
to
speak
implicit
in
the
growth
of
knowledge
its
complete
expression
is
the
consummation
of
a
process
that
began
with
the
first
questionings
of
religion
and
the
completion
of
the
process
means
the
death
of
supernaturalisms
in
all
forms
circumstances
may
obstruct
its
universal
acceptance
as
a
reasoned
mental
attitude
but
that
merely
delays
it
does
not
destroy
the
certainty
of
its
final
triumph
the
philosophy
of
atheism
leads
man
to
a
critical
analytical
and
logical
examination
of
his
environment
and
it
is
this
that
has
lead
to
all
of
our
advances
religion
creates
a
stunted
standard
of
reasoning
the
pathetic
cry
of
augustine
but
if
i
was
shapen
in
iniquity
and
in
sin
did
my
mother
conceive
me
where
i
pray
thee
o
my
god
where
lord
or
when
was
i
thy
servant
innocent
typifies
the
major
concern
of
the
narrow
egotistical
mystic
from
the
time
that
the
ideas
of
the
later
greek
philosophers
had
been
forgotten
until
the
present
time
man
has
floundered
in
a
sea
of
supernaturalism
it
is
high
time
that
man
faced
his
realities
with
fortitude
in
his
own
mentality
and
when
he
does
this
there
will
be
produced
a
race
of
men
who
will
seek
for
truth
for
truth
sake
a
race
of
supermen
who
will
lead
the
world
intellectually
it
is
to
russia
that
all
eyes
will
turn
in
the
next
few
generations
at
the
present
she
is
going
through
the
throes
of
childbirth
she
is
immature
and
as
a
child
she
staggers
the
abuse
and
ridicule
heaped
upon
her
now
is
but
the
repetition
of
that
given
by
all
frightened
societies
of
past
ages
when
they
contemplated
new
ideas
which
their
immature
minds
could
not
fathom
but
russia
will
emerge
in
the
not
too
distant
future
and
the
infant
will
shortly
reach
maturity
and
that
maturity
may
set
a
standard
for
those
timid
and
frightened
societies
that
at
present
look
with
dilated
eyes
upon
her
daring
the
age
is
approaching
when
the
god
idea
in
its
entirety
will
be
classed
with
the
gods
of
the
egyptians
and
babylonians
when
surplices
and
sacramental
plate
will
be
exhibited
in
museums
when
nurses
will
relate
to
children
the
legends
of
the
christian
mythology
as
they
now
tell
them
fairy
tales
the
gods
of
monotheism
will
join
the
gods
of
polytheism
and
yahveh
and
his
associates
will
occupy
in
the
minds
of
men
the
position
now
held
by
the
gods
of
olympus
to
our
ancestors
jupiter
and
yahveh
will
have
the
same
significance
in
a
little
time
the
cathedrals
and
churches
will
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
proud
poetical
glamour
of
abandoned
temples
men
and
women
will
enter
them
with
reverent
indulgence
as
they
now
in
meditative
mood
visit
the
few
remaining
pantheons
of
the
pagan
worship
hour
on
the
age
is
approaching
when
the
current
idea
of
the
hereafter
will
be
accounted
a
strange
and
selfish
idea
just
as
we
smile
at
the
savage
chief
who
believes
that
his
station
will
be
continued
in
the
world
beneath
the
ground
and
that
he
will
there
be
attended
by
his
concubines
and
slaves
the
age
is
fast
approaching
when
love
not
fear
will
unite
the
human
race
in
that
age
the
not
the
will
be
truth
and
the
one
faith
not
religion
but
a
sincere
and
lofty
conception
of
the
dignity
and
resourcefulness
of
the
human
mind
and
an
overwhelming
desire
to
aid
in
the
progress
of
all
mankind
the
extinction
of
disease
the
perfection
of
genius
the
perfection
of
love
and
therefore
the
abolition
of
war
the
exploration
of
the
infinite
and
the
conquest
of
creation
such
an
age
can
never
come
to
be
during
the
maljurisdiction
of
a
theistic
philosophy
it
can
only
come
into
being
when
the
vast
majority
of
men
are
by
the
force
of
advancing
knowledge
made
aware
of
the
truth
of
the
atheistic
philosophy
an
english
observer
joad
remarks
the
churches
no
doubt
will
continue
to
function
for
a
time
but
they
will
be
attended
increasingly
and
in
the
end
exclusively
by
ignorant
men
women
and
children
already
a
stranger
attending
an
average
church
of
england
service
would
almost
be
justified
in
assuming
that
the
churches
like
theatre
matinées
were
kept
up
for
the
benefit
of
women
and
children
so
far
as
present
indications
go
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
science
will
deliver
the
coup
de
grace
to
organized
christianity
within
the
next
hundred
years
we
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
theism
has
done
and
what
the
philosophy
of
atheism
might
have
done
and
will
yet
achieve
has
man
profited
by
having
remained
in
his
mental
infancy
so
long
atheism
is
an
emancipating
system
of
thought
that
frees
the
mind
from
myths
fables
and
childish
fancies
there
can
be
no
inquisition
no
witchcraft
delusion
no
religious
wars
no
persecutions
of
one
sect
by
another
no
impediment
to
science
and
progress
no
stultification
of
the
mind
as
a
result
of
its
teachings
the
philosophy
of
atheism
teaches
man
to
stand
on
his
own
feet
instills
confidence
in
his
reasoning
powers
and
forces
him
to
conquer
his
environment
it
teaches
him
not
to
subject
himself
and
debase
himself
before
mythical
superhuman
powers
for
his
reason
is
his
power
the
march
from
faith
to
reason
is
the
march
on
which
dwells
the
future
hope
of
a
really
civilized
mankind
atheism
teaches
man
to
endeavor
constantly
to
better
his
own
condition
and
that
of
all
of
his
fellowmen
to
make
his
children
wiser
and
happier
it
supplies
the
powerful
urge
to
add
something
new
to
the
knowledge
of
mankind
and
all
this
not
in
the
vain
hope
of
being
rewarded
in
another
world
but
from
a
pure
sense
of
duty
as
a
citizen
of
nature
as
a
patriot
of
the
planet
on
which
he
dwells
this
is
no
cold
and
cheerless
philosophy
it
is
an
elevating
and
ennobling
ideal
which
may
console
him
in
his
afflictions
and
teach
him
how
to
live
and
how
to
die
it
is
a
philosophy
that
makes
a
man
intellectually
free
and
this
mental
emancipation
allows
him
to
face
the
world
without
fear
of
ghosts
and
gods
it
relates
solely
to
facts
while
theism
resorts
to
opinions
that
are
grounded
only
upon
emotionalism
joseph
lewis
has
well
noted
that
atheism
does
not
believe
that
man
mission
on
earth
is
to
love
and
glorify
god
but
it
does
believe
in
living
this
life
so
that
when
you
pass
on
the
world
will
be
better
for
your
having
lived
the
history
of
the
past
ages
informs
us
what
the
world
was
like
with
god
the
progress
of
secular
knowledge
and
science
have
given
us
measures
by
which
we
could
produce
a
better
society
than
has
ever
existed
under
the
obstructionism
of
the
gods
the
knowledge
exists
by
which
universal
happiness
can
be
secured
the
chief
obstacle
to
its
utilization
for
that
purpose
is
the
teaching
of
religion
religion
prevents
our
children
from
having
a
rational
education
religion
prevents
us
from
removing
the
fundamental
causes
of
war
religion
prevents
us
from
teaching
the
ethics
of
scientific
cooperation
in
place
of
the
old
fierce
doctrines
of
sin
and
punishment
it
is
possible
that
mankind
is
on
the
threshold
of
a
golden
age
but
if
so
it
will
be
necessary
to
slay
the
dragon
that
guards
the
door
and
this
dragon
is
religion
it
is
interesting
to
contemplate
the
changes
that
may
occur
in
our
civilization
in
the
next
few
centuries
on
the
one
hand
we
have
that
long
period
of
sterile
time
years
for
the
stage
of
neolithic
man
and
on
the
other
the
vast
material
progress
of
the
past
three
hundred
years
we
may
not
be
able
to
discern
with
clarity
in
what
direction
changes
will
occur
but
in
one
aspect
we
can
discern
a
tendency
that
is
the
inevitable
conquest
of
the
philosophy
of
atheism
and
with
this
conquest
can
be
clearly
seen
that
it
would
give
to
this
earth
a
much
sounder
foundation
upon
which
to
build
our
progress
and
that
freedom
the
emancipation
of
the
mind
from
all
myths
and
fables
the
inevitableness
of
atheism
has
been
well
summed
up
by
chapman
cohen
looking
at
the
whole
course
of
human
history
and
noting
how
the
vilest
and
most
ruinous
practices
have
been
ever
associated
with
religion
and
have
ever
relied
upon
religion
for
support
the
cause
for
speculation
is
not
what
will
happen
to
the
world
when
religion
dies
out
but
how
human
society
has
managed
to
flourish
while
the
belief
in
the
gods
ruled
substantially
we
have
by
searching
found
out
god
we
know
the
origin
and
history
of
one
of
the
greatest
delusions
that
ever
possessed
the
human
mind
god
has
been
found
out
analytically
and
synthetically
we
understand
the
as
previous
generations
could
not
understand
it
it
has
been
explained
and
the
logical
consequence
of
the
explanation
is
atheism
man
is
fast
attaining
a
mastery
of
his
environment
and
his
religious
creeds
are
becoming
as
irrational
to
him
as
the
witchcraft
delusion
religion
with
its
burden
of
fear
ties
him
to
the
dead
ages
but
knowledge
not
only
supplies
him
with
power
but
also
furnishes
him
with
courage
and
that
courage
will
aid
him
in
freeing
himself
from
that
fear
religion
religion
is
doomed
to
occupy
the
same
place
in
history
as
the
institution
of
slavery
lies
and
imposture
no
matter
how
powerfully
sustained
can
be
dispelled
by
knowledge
the
church
will
destroy
itself
with
its
own
poison
knowledge
and
courage
spell
the
doom
of

my
own
view
on
religion
is
that
of
lucretius
i
regard
it
as
a
disease
born
of
fear
and
as
a
source
of
untold
misery
to
the
human
race
i
can
not
however
deny
that
it
has
made
contributions
to
civilization
it
helped
in
early
days
to
fix
the
calendar
and
it
caused
egyptian
priests
to
chronicle
eclipses
with
such
care
that
in
time
they
became
able
to
predict
them
these
two
services
i
am
prepared
to
acknowledge
but
i
do
not
know
of
any
others
max

it
is
my
conviction
that
the
happiest
and
noblest
life
attainable
by
men
and
women
is
jeopardized
by
reliance
upon
a
superhuman
cosmic
being
for
guidance
and
help
i
know
of
course
that
god
has
been
defined
in
various
terms
i
do
not
choose
among
them
for
it
seems
to
me
indisputable
that
those
who
turn
to
god
however
god
be
defined
do
so
because
consciously
or
unconsciously
they
seek
there
the
satisfaction
of
wants
the
worth
of
living
and
security
for
what
they
passionately
prize
which
they
have
not
found
and
despair
of
finding
in
the
human
venture
as
they
know
it
reliance
upon
god
for
what
life
does
not
afford
has
in
my
opinion
harmful
consequences
it
diverts
attention
from
the
specific
conditions
upon
which
a
better
or
a
worse
life
depends
it
leads
men
to
regard
themselves
as
spectators
of
a
course
of
events
which
they
in
reality
help
to
determine
it
makes
the
highest
human
excellence
consist
in
acquiescence
in
the
supposed
will
of
a
being
that
is
defined
as
not
human
a
being
that
is
above
the
driving
force
of
impulse
that
does
not
experience
vacillating
moods
or
conflicting
desires
that
is
never
harassed
by
doubts
or
misled
by
ignorance
theism
is
in
essence
repressive
prohibitory
ascetic
the
outcome
of
its
influence
is
that
expertness
in
practical
living
and
expertness
in
evaluating
life
instead
of
uniting
to
take
advantage
of
a
common
opportunity
are
set
against
each
other
this
is
the
profound
dualism
which
remains
to
be
mastered
it
can
be
mastered
by
the
concentration
upon
human
needs
and
powers
john

the
method

he
lives

in
this
they
are

carrying
on

order

looks
back

history
one
realizes

any
discovery

has
made

have

the

record
in
the
past
it
is
not

thousand

mould

to

we
still
have
our
prisons
our
judges
and
our
wars
and
it
remains
today
as
it
has
done
for
two
thousand
years
past
an
arguable
question
whether
men
are
better
or
worse
than
they
were

was

by
a
tradition
of
divine
authority
and
with
no
more
sacredness
than
a
newly
discovered
writing
of
ancient
china
or
egypt
we
can
see
quite
readily
that
it
would
occur
to
nobody
who
took
the
work
merely
on
its
merits
either
to
accept
it
as
scientifically
and
historically
true
or
to
twist
its
statements
into
a
allegory
of
the
truth
religion
will
be
and
its
tidings
of
escape
to
another
and
better
world
will
ring
cold
in
the
ears
of
those
who
love
this
the
new
worldliness
that
religion
must
face
is
based
on
the
faith
that
there
is
not
only
no
for

no
for
it

walter
lippmann
many
reasons
have
been
adduced
to
explain
why
people
do
not
go
to
church
as
much
as
they
once
did
surely
the
most
important
reason
is
that
they
are
not
so
certain
that
they
are
going
to
meet
god
when
they
go
to
church
if
they
had
that
certainty
they
would
go
if
they
really
believed
that
they
were
being
watched
by
a
supreme
being
who
is
more
powerful
than
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
put
together
if
they
really
believed
that
not
only
their
actions
but
their
secret
thoughts
were
known
and
would
be
remembered
by
the
creator
and
ultimate
judge
of
the
universe
there
would
be
no
complaint
whatever
about
church
attendance
the
most
worldly
would
be
in
the
front
pews
and
preachers
would
not
have
to
resort
so
often
to
their
rather
desperate
expedients
to
attract
an
audience
if
the
conviction
were
there
that
the
creed
professed
was
invincibly
true
the
modern
congregation
would
not
come
to
church
as
they
usually
do
today
to
hear
the
preacher
and
to
listen
to
the
music
they
would
come
to
worship
god
mencken
alone
among
the
great
nations
of
history
we
have
got
rid
of
religion
as
a
serious
scourge
and
by
the
simple
process
of
reducing
it
to
a
petty
nuisance
for
men
become

not
in
proportion
to
their
willingness
to
believe

in
proportion
to
their
readiness
to
doubt
the
more
stupid
the
man
the
larger
his
stock
of
adamantine
assurances
the
heavier
his
load
of
faith
when
copernicus
proved
that
the
earth
revolved
around
the
sun
he
did
not
simply
prove
that
the
earth
revolved
around
the
sun
he
also
proved
that
the
revelation
of
god
as
contained
in
the
old
testament
was
rubbish
the
first
fact
was
relatively
trivial
it
made
no
difference
to
the
average
man
then
as
it
makes
no
difference
to
him
today
but
the
second
fact
was
of
stupendous
importance
for
it
disposed
at
one
stroke
of
a
mass
of
bogus
facts
that
had
been
choking
the
intelligence
and
retarding
the
progress
of
humanity
for
a
millennium
and
a
half
i
believe
that
religion
generally
speaking
has
been
a
curse
to
mankind
that
its
modest
and
greatly
overestimated
services
on
the
ethical
side
have
been
more
than
overborne
by
the
damage
it
has
done

it
is
a
significant
trait
of

that
the
times

most

are
also
most
distinguished
for
backwardness

from

the

states
of

for

everywhere
the
scope
and
intensity
of
belief
in
the
supernatural
seem
to
be
directly
proportional
to
the
misery
and
weakness
of
the
believer
one

for
the

of

which
means
generally
restraint
of
all
interference
in

amicable
threshing
out
of
conflicting
opinions
means
with
respect
to
religious
beliefs
refraining
from
talking
writing
or
discussing
candidly
at
all
in
every
society
belief
in
the
supernatural
is
privileged
belief
and
there
accrue
to
it
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
privilege

are
not
silent
on
the
contrary

albert

i
do
not

we
can
have
any
freedom
at
all
in
the
philosophical
sense
for
we
act
not
only
under
external
compulsion
but
also
by
inner
necessity
i
can
not
imagine
a
god
who
rewards
and
punishes
the
objects
of
his
creation
whose
purposes
are
modelled
after
our
own
a
god

who
is

a
reflection
of

frailty
neither

the
death
of
his

although
feeble
souls
harbor
such
thoughts
through

or
ridiculous
egotism
it
is
enough
for
me
to
contemplate
the
mystery
of
conscious
life
perpetuating
itself
through
all
eternity
to
reflect
upon
the
marvelous
structure
of
the

the

charles

the

nature

toward
the

which
are
intolerable
to

ethical
mind
of
the

the
conception
of
one
being
human
or
divine
suffering
though
innocent
for
the
sins
of
others
is
revolting
to
the
universal
sense

justice

no

no

would
punish
the
innocent
when
the
guilty
were

this
conception

is
hideous
