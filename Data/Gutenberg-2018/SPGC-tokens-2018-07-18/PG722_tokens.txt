together
with
anecdotes
characteristics
and
chronology
near
the
northeast
corner
of
the
old
common
of
boston
a
section
of
ground
was
put
apart
long
before
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
be
a
burying
ground
for
some
of
the
heroic
dead
of
the
city
of
the
puritans
for
some
quaint
reason
or
caprice
this
acre
of
god
was
called
the
granary
and
is
so
called
to
this
day
perhaps
the
name
was
given
because
the
dead
were
here
garnered
as
grain
from
the
reaping
until
the
bins
be
opened
at
the
last
day
threshing
when
the
chaff
shall
be
driven
from
the
wheat
here
the
thoughtless
throng
looking
through
the
iron
railing
may
see
the
old
and
slabs
with
their
curious
lettering
which
designate
the
spots
where
many
of
the
men
of
the
epoch
were
laid
to
their
last
repose
the
word
cemetery
is
from
greek
and
means
the
little
place
where
i
lie
down
in
the
granary
burying
ground
are
the
tombs
of
many
whom
history
has
gathered
and
recorded
as
her
own
but
history
looks
in
vain
among
the
slabs
of
for
the
name
of
one
who
was
greatest
perhaps
of
them
all
but
whose
last
days
were
so
strangely
clouded
and
whose
sepulchre
was
so
obscure
as
to
leave
the
world
in
doubt
for
more
than
a
half
century
as
to
where
the
body
of
the
great
sleeper
had
been
laid
curiosity
whetted
by
patriotism
then
discovered
the
spot
but
the
name
of
another
was
on
the
covering
slab
and
no
small
token
was
to
be
found
indicative
of
the
last
resting
place
of
the
body
of
james
otis
the
prophetic
giant
of
the
days
he
who
had
lived
like
one
of
the
homeric
heroes
who
had
died
like
a
titan
under
a
thunderbolt
and
had
been
buried
as
obscurely
as
richard
the
lion
hearted
or
frederick
barbarossa
must
lie
neglected
in
an
unknown
tomb
within
a
few
rods
of
the
spot
where
his
eloquence
aforetime
had
aroused
his
countrymen
to
national
consciousness
and
made
a
foreign
tyranny
forever
impossible
in
that
old
boston
the
very
name
of
which
became
henceforth
the
menace
of
kings
and
the
synonym
of
liberty
tradition
rather
than
history
has
preserved
thus
much
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
a
row
of
great
elms
known
as
the
paddock
elms
stood
in
what
is
now
the
sidewalk
on
the
west
side
of
tremont
street
skirting
the
granary
burying
ground
these
trees
were
cut
away
and
the
first
section
of
the
burial
space
was
invaded
with
the
spade
tomb
no
over
which
the
iron
railing
now
passes
was
divided
down
as
far
as
where
the
occupants
are
lying
within
the
sepulchre
were
several
bodies
one
was
the
body
of
nathaniel
cunningham
another
was
ruth
cunningham
his
wife
the
younger
members
of
the
family
were
also
there
in
death
when
the
lid
of
one
coffin
in
this
invaded
tomb
was
lifted
it
was
found
that
a
mass
of
the
living
roots
of
the
old
strong
elm
near
by
had
twined
about
the
skull
of
the
sleeper
had
entered
through
the
apertures
and
had
eaten
up
the
brain
it
was
the
brain
of
james
otis
which
had
given
itself
to
the
life
of
the
elm
and
had
been
transformed
into
branch
and
leaf
and
blossom
thus
breathing
itself
forth
again
into
the
free
air
and
the
universal
flow
the
body
of
the
patriot
had
been
deposited
in
this
tomb
of
his
the
nathaniel
cunningham
just
referred
to
and
had
there
reposed
until
the
searching
fibres
of
another
order
of
life
had
found
it
out
and
lifted
and
dispensed
its
sublimer
part
into
the
viewless
air
over
the
grave
in
which
the
body
was
laid
is
still
one
of
the
rude
slabs
which
the
fathers
provided
and
on
this
is
cut
the
name
of
george
longley
he
being
the
successor
of
the
cunninghams
in
the
ownership
of
tomb
no
here
then
was
witnessed
the
last
transformation
of
the
material
visible
man
called
james
otis
the
courageous
herald
who
ran
swinging
a
torch
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
american
revolution
the
are
the
titans
of
human
history
the
revolutionists
proper
are
only
heroes
and
the
are
too
frequently
dwarfs
and
weaklings
this
signifies
that
civilization
advances
by
revolutionary
stages
and
that
history
sends
out
her
tallest
and
best
sons
to
explore
the
line
of
march
and
to
select
the
spot
for
the
next
it
is
not
they
who
actually
command
the
oncoming
columns
and
who
seem
so
huge
against
the
historical
background
it
is
not
these
but
rather
the
hoarse
forerunners
and
shaggy
prophets
of
progress
who
are
the
real
kings
of
men
the
true
princes
of
the
human
empire
these
principles
of
the
civilized
life
were
strongly
illustrated
in
our
war
of
independence
the
forerunners
of
that
war
were
a
race
of
giants
their
like
has
hardly
been
seen
in
any
other
epoch
of
that
sublime
scrimmage
called
history
five
or
six
names
may
be
selected
from
the
list
of
the
early
american
prophets
whose
deeds
and
outcry
if
reduced
to
hexameters
would
be
not
the
iliad
not
the
jerusalem
delivered
but
the
epic
of
human
liberty
the
greatest
of
these
our
protagonists
of
freedom
was
benjamin
franklin
after
him
it
were
difficult
to
name
the
second
it
is
always
difficult
to
find
the
second
man
for
there
are
several
who
come
after
in
the
case
of
our
forerunners
the
second
may
have
been
thomas
jefferson
it
may
have
been
samuel
adams
it
may
have
been
his
cousin
it
may
have
been
thomas
paine
it
may
have
been
patrick
henry
it
may
have
been
james
otis
the
subject
of
this
monograph
it
is
remarkable
to
note
how
elusive
are
the
lives
of
many
great
men
some
of
the
greatest
have
hardly
been
known
at
all
others
are
known
only
by
glimpses
and
outlines
some
are
known
chiefly
by
myth
and
tradition
nor
does
the
effort
to
discover
the
details
of
such
lives
yield
any
considerable
results
there
are
great
names
which
have
come
to
us
from
antiquity
or
out
of
the
middle
ages
that
are
known
only
as
names
or
only
by
a
few
striking
incidents
in
some
cases
our
actual
knowledge
of
men
who
are
believed
to
have
taken
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
drama
of
their
times
is
so
meagre
and
uncertain
that
critical
disputes
have
arisen
respecting
the
very
existence
of
such
personages
homer
for
example
was
he
myth
or
man
the
christ
where
was
he
and
how
did
he
pass
his
life
from
his
twelfth
year
to
the
beginning
of
his
ministry
what
were
the
dates
of
his
birth
and
death
shakespeare
why
should
not
the
details
of
his
life
or
some
considerable
portion
of
the
facts
compare
in
plenitude
and
authenticity
with
the
events
in
johnson
career
it
seems
to
be
the
law
of
biography
that
those
characters
who
are
known
to
the
world
by
a
few
brilliant
strokes
of
genius
have
as
a
rule
only
a
meagre
personal
history
while
they
whose
characters
have
been
built
up
painfully
and
slowly
out
of
the
commonplace
like
the
coral
islands
of
the
atlantic
have
a
great
variety
and
multitude
of
materials
ready
for
the
hands
of
the
biographer
james
otis
belonged
to
the
first
of
these
classes
there
is
a
measure
of
elusiveness
about
his
life
our
lack
of
knowledge
respecting
him
however
is
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
near
the
close
of
his
life
while
he
was
oscillating
in
a
condition
between
andover
and
boston
with
an
occasional
visit
to
plymouth
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
pessimism
and
despair
during
which
he
spent
two
days
in
obliterating
the
materials
for
his
biography
by
destroying
all
his
letters
and
manuscripts
he
did
as
much
as
he
could
to
make
impossible
any
adequate
account
of
his
career
or
any
suitable
revelation
of
his
character
as
developed
in
his
correspondence
over
and
above
this
however
the
materials
of
his
life
are
of
small
extent
and
fragmentary
it
is
to
his
formal
publications
and
the
common
tradition
of
what
he
did
that
we
must
turn
for
our
biographical
and
historical
estimate
of
the
man
in
this
respect
he
is
in
analogy
with
patrick
henry
who
appears
only
fitfully
in
history
but
with
meteoric
brilliancy
or
with
abraham
lincoln
the
narrative
of
whose
life
for
the
first
years
can
be
adequately
written
in
ten
pages
the
american
otises
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
of
english
descent
the
emigration
of
the
family
from
the
mother
country
occurred
at
an
early
day
when
the
settlements
in
new
england
were
still
infrequent
and
weak
the
otis
family
was
among
the
first
to
settle
at
the
town
of
hingham
nor
was
it
long
until
the
name
appeared
in
the
public
records
indicating
official
rank
and
leadership
from
hingham
john
otis
who
was
born
in
ancestor
of
the
subject
of
this
sketch
removed
to
barnstable
near
the
center
of
the
peninsula
of
massachusetts
and
became
one
of
the
first
men
of
that
settlement
he
was
sent
to
the
legislature
and
thence
to
the
council
of
the
colony
in
which
he
had
a
seat
for
years
during
this
period
he
was
promoted
to
the
place
of
chief
justice
of
the
common
pleas
and
while
holding
this
important
place
he
was
also
judge
of
the
probate
court
the
family
rose
and
flourished
in
reputation
in
james
otis
son
of
judge
john
otis
was
born
he
followed
in
his
father
footsteps
becoming
a
lawyer
and
colonial
publicist
afterwards
a
colonel
of
the
militia
a
judge
of
the
common
pleas
a
judge
of
the
probate
court
and
a
member
of
the
council
of
massachusetts
just
after
reaching
his
majority
colonel
otis
took
in
marriage
mary
alleyne
and
of
this
union
were
born
thirteen
children
the
eldest
was
a
son
and
to
him
was
given
his
father
name
it
was
to
this
child
that
destiny
had
assigned
the
heroic
work
of
confronting
the
aggressions
of
great
britain
on
the
american
colonists
and
of
inspiring
the
latter
to
forcible
resistance
james
otis
junior
was
born
at
a
place
called
great
marshes
now
known
as
west
barnstable
on
the
of
february
he
inherited
from
his
father
and
grandfather
not
only
a
large
measure
of
talents
but
also
a
passion
for
public
life
which
impelled
him
strongly
to
the
study
and
solution
of
those
questions
which
related
to
the
welfare
of
the
american
colonies
and
to
the
means
by
which
their
political
independence
might
be
ultimately
secured
the
character
and
intellect
of
colonel
otis
of
barnstable
were
transmitted
to
other
members
of
his
family
also
the
daughter
mercy
oldest
sister
of
james
otis
was
married
to
james
warren
who
made
his
home
at
plymouth
this
lady
had
her
passion
for
politics
an
enthusiasm
which
could
hardly
be
restrained
she
wrote
and
conversed
in
a
fiery
manner
on
the
revolutionary
topics
of
the
day
almost
coincidently
with
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
she
composed
and
published
without
her
name
however
a
biting
satire
on
the
colonial
policy
of
great
britain
calling
her
brochure
the
group
fifteen
years
afterwards
she
published
a
volume
of
poems
mostly
patriotic
pieces
and
finally
in
a
brief
history
of
the
american
revolution
which
was
considered
a
reputable
work
after
its
kind
samuel
alleyne
otis
youngest
brother
of
james
outlived
nearly
all
the
other
members
of
the
family
and
was
recognized
as
a
prominent
political
leader
he
also
had
the
strong
patriotic
and
revolutionary
bent
of
the
family
was
popular
and
influential
and
was
honored
with
a
long
term
of
service
as
secretary
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
in
this
capacity
he
participated
april
in
the
inauguration
of
washington
holding
the
bible
on
which
the
father
of
his
country
took
the
oath
of
office
the
other
brothers
and
sisters
were
of
less
conspicuous
ability
and
were
not
so
well
known
to
their
own
and
other
times
in
new
england
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
sentiment
of
education
was
universal
among
the
leading
people
the
sentiment
was
intense
colonel
otis
of
barnstable
was
alert
with
respect
to
the
discipline
and
development
of
his
children
he
gave
to
them
all
to
the
sons
especially
the
best
advantages
which
the
commonwealth
afforded
james
otis
was
assigned
to
the
care
of
reverend
jonathan
russell
the
minister
at
barnstable
who
prepared
the
youth
for
college
by
the
middle
of
his
fifteenth
year
he
was
thought
to
be
ready
for
matriculation
he
was
accordingly
entered
as
a
freshman
at
harvard
in
june
of
the
incidents
of
his
preceding
boyhood
we
know
but
little
a
tradition
exists
that
he
was
more
precocious
than
diligent
that
his
will
was
strong
that
his
activities
were
marked
with
a
reckless
audacity
which
however
did
not
distinguish
him
much
from
the
other
promising
new
england
boys
of
his
age
something
of
these
characteristics
are
noticeable
in
his
college
career
at
harvard
he
showed
an
abundance
of
youthful
spirits
a
strong
social
disposition
and
a
discrimination
between
his
friends
and
his
enemies
at
times
he
applied
himself
assiduously
and
at
other
times
mused
and
read
rather
than
studied
on
the
whole
he
did
not
greatly
distinguish
himself
as
a
student
his
passion
for
literature
was
marked
and
he
became
conspicuous
for
his
forensic
abilities
towards
the
end
of
his
course
his
character
as
a
student
was
intensified
and
he
was
not
often
seen
away
from
his
books
out
of
term
time
he
would
return
to
his
father
home
taking
his
books
with
him
at
such
times
he
was
rarely
seen
by
his
former
companions
of
barnstable
because
of
his
habit
of
secluding
himself
for
study
it
is
narrated
that
at
this
period
of
his
life
young
otis
gave
strong
evidence
of
the
excitable
temperament
with
which
he
was
endowed
in
the
intervals
of
his
study
his
nervous
system
under
the
stimulus
of
games
or
controversial
dispute
would
become
so
tense
with
excitement
as
to
provoke
remark
nor
may
we
in
the
retrospect
fail
to
discover
in
this
quality
of
mind
and
temper
the
premonitions
of
that
malady
which
finally
prevailed
over
the
lucid
understanding
and
rational
activities
of
james
otis
the
youth
did
not
much
effect
social
accomplishments
he
had
a
passion
for
music
and
learned
to
play
the
violin
with
this
instrument
he
was
wont
to
entertain
himself
in
the
intervals
of
study
sometimes
he
would
play
for
company
it
was
one
of
his
habits
to
break
off
suddenly
and
rather
capriciously
in
the
midst
of
what
he
was
doing
thus
did
he
with
his
music
it
is
narrated
that
on
a
certain
occasion
while
playing
by
invitation
for
some
friends
he
suddenly
put
aside
the
instrument
saying
in
a
sort
of
declamatory
manner
as
was
his
wont
so
fiddled
orpheus
and
so
danced
the
brutes
he
then
ran
into
the
garden
and
could
not
be
induced
to
play
the
violin
again
young
otis
passed
through
the
regular
classes
at
harvard
and
was
graduated
in
on
that
occasion
he
took
part
in
a
disputation
which
was
one
of
the
exercises
of
his
class
otherwise
his
record
at
the
college
is
not
accented
with
any
special
work
which
he
did
at
the
time
of
his
graduation
he
was
in
his
nineteenth
year
it
had
been
his
father
purpose
and
his
own
that
his
profession
should
be
the
law
it
does
not
appear
however
that
his
college
studies
were
especially
directed
to
this
end
at
any
rate
he
did
not
devote
himself
at
once
to
the
law
but
assiduously
for
two
years
to
a
general
course
of
study
chosen
and
directed
by
himself
with
a
view
to
the
further
discipline
of
his
mind
and
the
widening
of
his
information
it
was
an
educational
theory
with
otis
that
such
an
interval
of
personal
and
spontaneous
application
should
intervene
between
a
young
man
graduation
and
the
beginning
of
his
professional
career
having
pursued
this
course
with
himself
he
insisted
that
his
younger
brother
samuel
alleyne
otis
should
take
the
same
course
in
one
of
his
letters
to
his
father
a
communication
fortunately
rescued
from
the
holocaust
of
his
correspondence
he
discusses
the
question
and
urges
the
propriety
of
the
young
man
devoting
a
year
or
two
to
general
study
before
taking
up
his
law
books
an
extract
from
the
letter
will
prove
of
interest
the
writer
says
it
is
with
sincerest
pleasure
i
find
my
brother
samuel
has
well
employed
his
time
during
his
residence
at
home
i
am
sure
you
do
think
the
time
long
he
is
spending
in
his
present
course
of
studies
since
it
is
past
all
doubt
they
are
not
only
ornamental
and
useful
but
indispensably
necessary
preparatories
for
the
figure
i
hope
one
day
for
his
and
your
sake
as
well
as
my
own
to
see
him
make
in
the
profession
he
is
determined
to
pursue
i
am
sure
the
year
and
a
half
i
spent
in
the
same
way
after
leaving
the
academy
was
as
well
spent
as
any
part
of
my
life
and
i
shall
always
lament
i
did
not
take
a
year
or
two
further
for
more
general
inquiries
in
the
arts
and
sciences
before
i
sat
down
to
the
laborious
study
of
the
laws
of
my
country
my
brother
judgment
ca
at
present
be
supposed
to
be
ripe
enough
for
so
severe
an
exercise
as
the
proper
reading
and
well
digesting
the
common
law
very
sure
i
am
if
he
would
stay
a
year
or
two
from
the
time
of
his
degree
before
he
begins
with
the
law
he
will
be
able
to
make
better
progress
in
one
week
than
he
could
now
without
a
miracle
in
six
early
and
short
clerkships
and
a
premature
rushing
into
practice
without
a
competent
knowledge
in
the
theory
of
law
have
blasted
the
hopes
and
ruined
the
expectations
formed
by
the
parents
of
most
of
the
students
in
the
profession
who
have
fallen
within
my
observation
for
these
ten
or
fifteen
years
past
the
writer
of
this
communication
then
adds
in
proof
of
his
position
the
names
of
several
distinguished
jurists
who
postponed
the
beginning
of
their
legal
studies
or
at
least
their
legal
practice
to
a
time
of
life
quite
beyond
the
conventional
student
period
otis
then
declares
his
conviction
that
a
young
man
may
well
procrastinate
his
legal
studies
until
he
shall
have
attained
the
age
of
thirty
or
even
of
forty
years
he
declares
his
belief
that
such
postponement
will
as
a
rule
lead
to
better
result
than
can
be
attained
by
a
youth
who
begins
at
twenty
however
brilliant
his
genius
may
be
this
view
of
the
case
was
with
james
otis
both
theory
and
practice
he
began
his
legal
studies
in
in
that
year
he
became
a
law
student
under
the
tuition
of
jeremiah
gridley
who
at
that
time
was
already
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
able
and
accomplished
lawyers
in
massachusetts
preceptor
and
student
were
at
the
first
in
accord
in
their
political
and
social
principles
at
the
time
of
the
young
man
law
course
gridley
was
a
member
of
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
he
belonged
to
the
party
called
whig
for
the
political
jargon
of
great
britain
had
infected
the
americans
also
and
they
divided
according
to
the
names
and
principles
of
the
british
partisans
of
the
period
judge
gridley
while
he
remained
on
the
bench
took
sides
with
the
colonists
in
their
oncoming
contention
with
the
mother
country
afterwards
however
by
accepting
the
appointment
of
attorney
general
he
became
one
of
the
king
officers
and
it
was
in
this
relation
that
he
was
subsequently
brought
face
to
face
with
his
distinguished
pupil
in
the
trial
of
the
most
remarkable
case
which
preceded
the
revolutions
otis
devoted
two
years
of
time
to
his
legal
studies
before
beginning
the
practice
of
his
profession
the
study
of
law
at
that
time
was
much
more
difficult
than
at
the
present
day
the
student
was
obliged
to
begin
de
novo
with
the
old
statutes
and
decisions
and
to
make
up
the
science
for
himself
by
a
difficult
induction
which
not
many
young
men
were
able
to
do
successfully
law
were
virtually
unknown
otis
did
not
even
have
access
to
blackstone
commentaries
no
authoritative
works
on
evidence
or
pleading
existed
in
the
english
language
the
student
must
get
down
his
acts
of
parliament
his
decisions
of
the
king
bench
his
coke
his
dissertations
on
the
common
law
and
out
of
these
construct
the
best
he
could
a
legal
system
for
himself
to
this
work
otis
devoted
himself
from
to
after
which
he
left
the
office
of
judge
gridley
and
went
to
plymouth
where
he
applied
for
admission
to
the
bar
and
was
accepted
by
the
court
he
began
to
practice
in
the
year
of
the
treaty
of
when
the
political
and
historical
status
of
europe
was
again
fixed
for
a
brief
period
the
young
attorney
almost
immediately
took
rank
at
the
plymouth
bar
the
old
records
of
the
court
at
that
place
still
show
the
frequent
appearance
of
otis
for
one
or
the
other
of
the
parties
in
this
manner
were
passed
the
years
and
it
does
not
appear
that
at
this
time
he
concerned
himself
very
much
with
the
affairs
of
the
town
or
the
larger
affairs
of
the
commonwealth
the
tax
records
show
his
name
with
an
entry
to
the
effect
that
in
he
estimated
his
personal
estate
at
twenty
pounds
besides
his
faculty
by
which
was
meant
his
professional
value
a
few
incidents
of
this
period
in
otis
life
have
come
down
by
tradition
he
soon
made
a
favorable
impression
on
the
court
and
bar
he
gained
the
good
opinion
of
his
fellows
for
both
ability
and
integrity
of
character
this
reputation
he
carried
with
him
to
boston
whither
he
removed
early
in
the
year
he
had
already
acquired
sufficient
character
to
bring
his
services
into
requisition
at
places
somewhat
distant
from
plymouth
his
reception
in
boston
was
accordingly
favorable
beyond
the
limits
of
the
colony
he
became
known
as
an
advocate
he
was
sent
for
in
important
cases
and
showed
such
signal
ability
as
to
attract
the
admiring
attention
of
both
court
and
people
already
at
the
conclusion
of
his
year
he
was
a
young
man
of
note
rising
to
eminence
there
was
good
ground
for
this
reputation
in
both
his
principles
of
conduct
and
his
legal
abilities
from
the
first
he
avoided
the
littleness
and
quibble
which
are
the
bane
of
the
bar
he
had
a
high
notion
of
what
a
lawyer
should
be
and
of
the
method
and
spirit
in
which
he
should
conduct
his
cases
he
had
as
much
dignity
as
audacity
a
sense
of
justice
as
keen
as
the
purpose
was
zealous
in
pursuing
it
it
came
to
be
understood
in
the
courts
of
boston
when
otis
appeared
as
an
advocate
that
he
had
a
case
and
believed
in
it
he
avoided
accepting
retainers
in
cases
of
the
justice
of
which
he
was
in
doubt
pursuing
this
method
he
was
sometimes
involved
in
in
which
he
was
constrained
to
turn
upon
his
own
client
the
story
goes
of
one
such
instance
in
which
he
brought
suit
for
the
collection
of
a
bill
believing
in
his
client
and
in
the
justice
of
the
claim
he
pressed
the
matter
in
court
and
was
about
to
obtain
a
judgment
when
he
accidentally
discovered
among
his
client
papers
a
receipt
which
the
plaintiff
had
signed
for
the
very
claim
under
consideration
through
some
mistake
the
receipt
had
again
got
back
into
the
man
possession
and
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
fact
to
institute
a
suit
for
the
collection
of
the
claim
a
second
time
seeing
through
the
matter
at
once
otis
took
the
plaintiff
aside
confronted
him
with
the
receipt
and
denounced
him
to
his
face
as
a
rascal
the
man
gave
down
and
begged
for
quarter
but
otis
was
inexorable
he
went
back
to
the
bar
and
stated
to
the
court
that
reasons
existed
why
the
case
of
his
client
should
be
dismissed
the
court
presided
over
by
judge
hutchinson
afterward
and
chief
justice
of
massachusetts
expressed
its
surprise
at
the
turn
of
affairs
complimented
otis
for
his
honorable
course
as
an
advocate
commended
his
conduct
to
the
bar
and
dismissed
the
case
with
the
spread
of
his
reputation
otis
was
summoned
on
legal
business
to
distant
parts
on
one
occasion
he
was
called
to
halifax
to
defend
some
prisoners
under
arrest
for
piracy
believing
them
to
be
innocent
he
convinced
the
court
in
an
eloquent
plea
and
secured
the
acquittal
of
the
prisoners
on
another
occasion
he
was
summoned
to
plymouth
to
defend
some
citizens
of
that
town
who
had
become
involved
in
a
riot
on
the
anniversary
of
the
gunpowder
plot
it
was
the
custom
in
the
new
england
towns
to
observe
this
day
with
a
mock
procession
in
which
effigies
representing
the
pope
the
old
bad
one
and
james
the
pretender
were
carried
through
the
streets
to
be
consigned
at
the
end
to
a
bonfire
in
this
instance
violence
was
done
by
some
of
the
participants
windows
were
smashed
gates
were
broken
down
etc
otis
conducted
the
defense
showing
that
the
arrested
persons
taking
part
in
a
noisy
anniversary
and
committing
acts
that
were
innocent
in
spirit
if
not
innocent
per
se
ought
not
to
be
adjudged
guilty
of
serious
misdemeanor
this
plea
prevailed
and
the
young
men
were
acquitted
it
is
to
be
greatly
regretted
that
the
legal
pleas
and
addresses
of
james
otis
have
not
been
preserved
a
volume
of
his
speeches
would
reveal
not
only
his
style
and
character
but
also
much
of
the
history
of
the
times
the
materials
however
are
wanting
he
kept
a
commonplace
book
in
which
most
of
his
business
letters
of
the
period
under
consideration
were
recorded
but
these
give
hardly
a
glimpse
at
the
man
the
orator
or
his
work
tradition
however
is
rife
with
the
myth
of
his
method
and
manner
he
was
essentially
an
orator
he
had
the
orator
fire
and
passion
also
the
orator
eccentricities
his
sudden
high
flights
and
transitions
his
quick
appeals
and
succession
of
images
to
these
qualities
of
the
orator
in
general
otis
added
the
power
of
applying
himself
to
the
facts
also
the
power
of
cogent
reasoning
and
masterful
search
for
the
truth
which
gained
for
him
at
length
the
fame
of
first
orator
of
the
revolution
the
passion
and
vehemence
of
the
man
made
him
at
times
censorious
and
satirical
his
manner
towards
his
opponents
was
at
times
hard
to
bear
his
wit
was
of
that
sarcastic
kind
which
like
a
hot
wind
withers
its
object
all
of
these
dispositions
seemed
to
increase
his
power
and
to
augment
his
reputation
but
they
did
not
augment
his
happiness
his
character
as
an
advocate
and
as
a
man
came
out
in
full
force
during
the
first
period
of
his
boston
practice
that
is
in
the
interval
from
to
on
attaining
his
thirtieth
year
otis
came
to
the
event
of
his
marriage
he
took
in
union
in
the
spring
of
ruth
cunningham
daughter
of
a
boston
merchant
from
one
point
of
view
his
choice
was
opportune
for
it
added
to
his
social
standing
and
also
to
his
means
from
another
aspect
however
the
marriage
was
less
fortunate
the
cunningham
family
was
not
well
grounded
in
the
principles
of
patriotism
the
timid
commercial
spirit
showed
itself
in
the
father
and
with
this
the
daughter
sympathized
the
sharp
line
of
division
between
patriotism
and
loyalty
had
not
yet
been
drawn
as
it
was
drawn
five
years
afterward
but
it
began
to
be
drawn
very
soon
after
the
marriage
with
serious
consequences
to
the
domestic
peace
of
the
family
it
appears
that
beside
this
general
cause
of
divergence
the
staid
and
unenthusiastic
character
of
otis
rather
chilled
the
ardor
of
the
husband
and
he
for
his
part
by
his
vehemence
and
eccentricity
did
not
strongly
conciliate
her
favor
there
were
times
of
active
disagreement
in
the
family
and
in
later
years
the
marriage
was
rather
a
fact
than
a
principle
the
result
of
otis
marriage
was
a
family
of
one
son
and
two
daughters
the
son
who
was
given
his
father
name
showed
his
father
characteristics
from
childhood
and
certainly
a
measure
of
his
genius
the
lad
however
entered
the
navy
at
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
became
a
midshipman
and
died
in
his
eighteenth
year
the
oldest
daughter
elizabeth
went
wholly
against
her
father
grain
and
purpose
just
before
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
but
after
the
case
had
been
clearly
made
up
she
was
married
to
a
certain
captain
brown
at
that
time
a
british
officer
in
boston
cordially
disliked
if
not
hated
by
james
otis
personally
brown
was
respectable
but
his
cause
was
odious
he
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
afterwards
he
was
promoted
and
was
given
a
command
in
england
thither
his
wife
went
with
him
and
otis
discarded
them
both
if
not
with
anathema
at
least
with
contempt
it
would
appear
that
his
natural
affection
was
blotted
out
at
least
his
resentment
was
and
when
he
came
to
make
his
will
he
described
the
circumstances
and
disinherited
elizabeth
with
a
shilling
the
fact
that
otis
favored
the
unfortunate
marriage
and
perhaps
brought
it
about
availing
herself
as
it
is
said
of
one
of
otis
spells
of
mental
aberration
to
carry
out
her
purposes
aggravated
the
difficulty
and
made
her
husband
exasperation
everlasting
the
younger
daughter
of
the
family
shared
her
patriotism
she
was
married
to
benjamin
lincoln
a
young
lawyer
of
boston
whose
father
was
general
benjamin
lincoln
of
revolutionary
fame
the
marriage
was
a
happy
one
but
ultimately
clouded
with
honorable
grief
two
promising
sons
were
born
but
each
died
before
reaching
his
majority
the
father
also
died
when
he
was
years
old
the
wife
and
mother
resided
in
cambridge
and
died
there
in
the
second
period
in
james
otis
life
may
be
regarded
as
extending
from
to
that
is
from
his
thirtieth
to
his
year
it
was
in
this
period
that
he
rose
to
eminence
already
distinguished
as
a
lawyer
he
now
became
more
distinguished
as
a
civilian
and
a
man
of
public
affairs
he
caught
the
rising
interest
as
at
the
springing
of
the
tide
and
rose
with
it
until
it
broke
in
lines
of
foam
along
the
shores
of
new
england
he
gained
the
confidence
of
the
patriot
party
of
which
he
was
the
natural
leader
his
influence
became
predominant
he
was
the
peer
of
the
two
adamses
and
touched
hands
right
and
left
with
the
foremost
men
of
all
the
colonies
it
surprises
us
to
note
that
at
this
time
james
otis
devoted
a
considerable
section
of
his
time
to
scholastic
and
literary
pursuits
he
was
a
student
not
only
of
men
and
affairs
but
of
books
now
it
was
that
the
influence
of
his
harvard
education
was
seen
in
both
his
studies
and
his
works
we
are
surprised
to
find
him
engaged
in
the
composition
of
a
which
is
still
extant
and
however
obsolete
by
no
means
devoid
of
merits
the
work
was
clearly
a
result
left
on
his
mind
from
his
student
days
he
composed
and
in
the
year
published
by
the
house
of
mecom
in
boston
a
page
brochure
entitled
the
rudiments
of
latin
prosody
with
a
dissertation
on
letters
and
the
principles
of
harmony
in
poetic
and
prosaic
composition
collected
from
some
of
the
best
writers
the
work
is
primarily
a
text
in
latin
prosody
in
which
the
author
thought
himself
to
improve
on
the
existing
treatises
on
that
subject
the
afterpart
of
the
pamphlet
is
devoted
to
a
curious
examination
of
the
qualities
of
the
letters
of
the
greek
and
roman
alphabets
in
this
he
attempts
to
teach
the
distinction
between
quantity
and
accent
in
the
greek
language
but
more
particularly
to
describe
the
position
and
physiological
action
of
the
organs
of
speech
in
producing
the
elementary
sounds
in
the

the
author
declares
his
conviction
that
the
growth
of
science
had
been
seriously
impeded
by
the
inattention
of
people
to
the
correct
utterance
of

he
also
points
out
the
great
abuses
in

prevailing
methods
and
declares
that
these
abuses
have
so
impeded
the
work
of
education
that
many
have
remained
children
all
their
days
having
written
and
published
his
work
on
latin
prosody
otis
next
produced
a
similar
work
on
the
prosody
of
greek
this
however
he
did
not
publish
and
he
is
said
to
have
destroyed
the
manuscript
at
the
time
of
burning
his
correspondence
near
the
end
of
his
life
a
conversation
of
james
otis
is
narrated
by
francis
bowen
in
jared
sparks
american
biography
in
which
the
orator
is
represented
in
speaking
of
the
bad
literary
taste
prevalent
among
the
boys
of
the
time
as
saying
these
lads
are
very
fond
of
talking
about
poetry
and
repeating
passages
of
it
the
poets
they
quote
i
know
nothing
of
but
do
you
take
care
james
otis
was
addressing
james
perkins
of
boston
that
you
give
in
to
this
folly
if
you
want
to
read
poetry
read
shakespeare
milton
dryden
and
pope
and
throw
all
the
rest
into
the
fire
these
are
all
that
are
worth
reading
in
this
brief
comment
the
severity
of
otis
literary
taste
is
indicated
and
also
something
of
the
rather
abrupt
and
dogmatic
character
of
his
mind
his
criticism
though
true
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
judicious
in
order
to
understand
the
part
which
james
otis
played
in
the
great
work
of
revolution
and
independence
it
is
now
necessary
to
note
with
care
the
conditions
into
which
he
was
cast
and
with
which
he
was
environed
at
that
period
of
his
life
when
the
flames
highest
and
the
audacity
of
the
soul
bounds
furthest
into
the
arena
of
danger
every
man
is
the
joint
product
of
himself
and
his
environment
his
life
is
the
resultant
of
the
two
forces
by
which
he
is
held
and
balanced
at
the
time
when
james
otis
reached
his
year
a
condition
had
supervened
in
the
american
colonies
which
reacted
upon
his
passionate
and
patriotic
nature
so
powerfully
as
to
bring
into
full
play
all
of
his
faculties
and
to
direct
the
whole
force
of
his
nature
against
the
tyrannical
method
of
the
mother
country
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
the
course
of
events
which
had
preceded
and
which
succeeded
the
crisis
in
james
otis
life
and
made
him
the
born
leader
of
his
countrymen
in
their
first
conflict
for
independence
great
britain
had
aforetime
permitted
the
american
colonists
to
plant
themselves
where
when
and
as
they
would
almost
every
colonial
settlement
had
been
an
adventure
the
emigrants
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
had
been
squeezed
out
by
the
hard
discipline
of
church
and
state
in
america
they
settled
as
they
might
and
england
did
look
to
know
or
care
in
the
language
of
one
of
the
bards
of
this
age
that
is
england
awful
way
of
doing
business
she
permitted
her
persecuted
children
to
brave
the
intolerable
ocean
in
leaking
ships
to
reach
the
new
world
if
they
could
and
survive
if
they
might
notwithstanding
this
hard
strain
on
the
sentiment
of
the
pilgrims
the
cavaliers
and
the
hugenots
they
remained
loyal
to
the
mother
country
they
built
their
little
states
in
the
wilderness
and
were
proud
to
christen
their
towns
and
villages
with
the
cherished
names
of
the
home
places
in
england
they
defended
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
against
the
inhospitality
of
nature
the
neglect
of
the
mother
country
and
the
cruelty
of
savage
races
it
was
only
when
they
grew
and
multiplied
and
flourished
that
our
little
seashore
republics
attracted
the
attention
of
the
mother
land
and
suggested
to
the
ministers
of
the
crown
the
possibility
of
plucking
something
from
the
new
states
which
had
now
demonstrated
their
ability
to
exist
and
to
yield
an
increase
meanwhile
for
six
generations
the
colonists
had
developed
their
own
social
affairs
and
managed
their
own
civil
affairs
according
to
the
exegencies
of
the
case
and
the
principles
of
democracy
their
methods
of
government
were
necessarily
republican
the
military
necessities
which
were
ever
at
the
door
had
taught
our
fathers
the
availability
of
arms
as
the
final
argument
in
the
debate
with
wrong
the
conflicts
with
the
indians
and
the
experiences
of
the
french
and
indian
war
had
shown
that
the
americans
were
able
to
hold
their
own
in
battle
under
these
conditions
there
was
a
natural
growth
of
public
opinion
in
the
colonies
tending
to
independence
of
action
and
to
indignant
protest
against
foreign
dictation
in
the
sixth
decade
of
the
eighteenth
century
many
of
the
leading
young
men
of
america
talked
and
wrote
of
independence
as
a
thing
desirable
and
possible
in
when
james
otis
was
thirty
years
of
age
his
young
friend
john
adams
sitting
one
day
in
his
school
house
in
connecticut
wrote
this
in
his
diary
in
another
century
all
europe
will
not
be
able
to
subdue
us
the
only
way
to
keep
us
from
setting
up
for
ourselves
is
to
disunite
us
we
thus
note
natural
conditions
as
tending
to
produce
a
rebellion
of
the
american
colonies
also
the
inherited
disposition
of
the
colonists
under
the
discipline
of
their
times
also
the
growth
of
public
opinion
among
the
leading
spirits
to
which
we
must
add
the
character
of
the
reigning
king
and
of
the
ministers
to
whom
he
entrusted
his
government
as
the
general
conditions
antecedent
to
the
revolutionary
movement
of
our
fathers
but
there
were
more
immediate
and
forceful
causes
which
operated
to
the
same
end
among
these
should
be
mentioned
as
a
prevailing
influence
the
right
of
arbitrary
government
claimed
by
great
britain
and
at
length
resisted
by
the
colonists
the
right
of
arbitrarily
controlling
the
american
states
was
shown
in
a
number
of
specific
acts
which
we
must
here
discuss
the
first
of
these
was
the
old
navigation
act
of
the
measure
adopted
by
the
government
of
cromwell
had
never
been
strenuously
enforced
it
was
the
peculiarity
of
all
the
early
legislation
of
great
britain
relative
to
the
colonies
that
it
was
either
misdirected
or
permitted
to
lapse
by
disuse
the
colonies
thus
literally
grew
with
little
home
direction
after
the
navigation
act
had
been
nominally
in
force
for
years
it
was
revived
and
supplemented
by
another
measure
known
as
the
importation
act
this
statute
dating
from
the
year
was
intended
to
be
an
actual
device
for
controlling
the
commercial
relations
with
the
colonies
by
the
terms
of
the
act
heavy
duties
were
laid
on
all
the
sugar
molasses
and
rum
which
should
be
imported
into
the
colonies
the
customs
were
exorbitant
and
were
from
the
first
evaded
as
far
as
possible
by
the
american
merchants
this
may
be
regarded
as
the
first
actual
breach
of
justice
on
the
one
side
and
good
faith
on
the
other
as
between
the
home
government
and
the
american
dependencies
of
great
britain
the
reader
will
note
that
the
question
at
issue
was
from
the
first
commercial
it
was
a
question
of
taking
something
from
the
colonists
and
of
giving
no
equivalent
either
in
value
or
political
rights
had
the
american
colonists
been
willing
to
be
taxed
and
searched
without
an
equivalent
then
would
there
have
been
no
revolution
it
will
be
noted
from
the
nature
of
the
question
that
the
issue
since
it
was
a
matter
of
the
merchants
was
also
a
matter
of
the
cities
for
the
merchant
and
the
city
go
together
with
the
country
folk
of
the
era
the
faultfinding
and
dispute
related
always
to
political
questions
proper
to
questions
of
rights
as
between
the
king
and
his
subjects
to
questions
of
institutional
forms
the
best
method
of
governing
etc
all
of
these
matters
however
could
have
been
easily
adjusted
and
if
there
were
an
if
in
history
they
would
have
been
adjusted
without
revolution
and
without
independence
the
commercial
question
however
involving
money
rights
and
implying
the
privilege
and
power
of
the
mother
country
to
take
from
the
colonists
their
property
however
small
the
amount
could
but
engender
resistance
and
if
the
claim
were
not
relinquished
could
but
lead
to
war
and
disruption
the
neglected
growth
of
the
colonies
had
in
the
meantime
established
in
the
seaboard
towns
of
america
usages
and
customs
which
were
repugnant
to
british
notions
of
regular
and
orderly
government
the
commercial
life
had
taken
a
form
of
its
own
the
americans
had
built
ships
and
warehouses
they
had
engaged
in
commerce
as
they
would
they
had
made
their
trade
as
free
as
possible
they
had
ignored
the
old
navigation
act
and
when
the
importation
act
was
passed
it
confronted
a
condition
in
america
it
applied
to
a
state
of
affairs
that
already
existed
the
american
ship
trading
with
the
west
indies
and
bringing
back
to
boston
a
cargo
of
molasses
or
rum
was
met
at
custom
house
with
an
exorbitant
requisition
the
officer
acting
under
the
importation
act
virtually
said
stand
and
deliver
if
it
were
a
british
ship
the
resistance
to
the
duty
would
be
offered
by
the
land
merchants
rather
than
by
the
sea
traders
for
the
merchants
did
not
desire
that
the
cost
of
the
merchandise
to
themselves
and
their
customers
should
be
doubled
without
some
equivalent
advantage
no
equivalent
advantage
was
either
visible
or
invisible
what
therefore
should
they
do
but
first
evade
and
then
openly
resist
there
was
an
epoch
of
evasion
this
covered
a
period
of
about
seventeen
years
extending
from
to
in
the
latter
year
an
act
was
passed
by
parliament
forbidding
the
erection
of
iron
works
in
america
the
manufacture
of
steel
was
especially
interdicted
the
measure
which
was
in
reality
directed
against
shipbuilding
included
a
provision
which
forbade
the
felling
of
pines
outside
of
enclosures
it
was
thus
sought
by
indirection
to
prevent
the
creation
of
a
merchant
marine
by
the
american
colonists
and
to
limit
their
commerce
to
british
ships
this
measure
like
the
importation
act
was
also
ignored
and
resisted
for
eleven
years
the
americans
persisted
in
their
usual
course
making
iron
cutting
pine
timber
and
building
ships
importing
molasses
and
rum
evading
the
duties
and
thus
getting
themselves
into
the
category
of
smugglers
it
was
this
precise
condition
of
affairs
which
led
to
a
still
more
stringent
measure
on
the
part
of
the
home
government
it
was
determined
in
parliament
to
put
an
end
to
the
evasion
and
resistance
of
the
american
merchants
and
importers
with
respect
to
the
existing
laws
the
customs
should
be
collected
it
was
deemed
best
however
that
the
new
measure
should
issue
from
the
judiciary
an
appeal
was
made
to
the
court
of
exchequer
in
england
for
the
granting
of
search
warrants
to
be
issued
in
america
by
the
officers
for
the
purpose
of
ferreting
out
contraband
goods
these
warrants
granted
by
the
court
of
exchequer
were
the
writs
of
assistance
the
name
of
which
appears
so
frequently
and
with
so
much
odium
in
the
colonial
history
of
the
times
these
writs
were
granted
by
the
court
under
pressure
of
the
ministry
in
the
year
the
writs
of
assistance
were
directed
to
the
officers
of
the
customs
in
america
but
any
officer
could
arm
one
of
his
subordinates
or
indeed
any
other
person
whom
he
should
designate
with
one
of
the
writs
and
the
person
so
appointed
might
act
in
the
name
of
the
king
officer
the
thing
to
be
done
was
the
examination
of
any
place
and
all
places
where
contraband
goods
might
be
supposed
to
be
lodged
whether
there
were
evidence
or
no
evidence
the
case
was
the
same
the
document
was
a
writ
of
arbitrary
search
any
house
public
or
private
might
be
entered
at
any
time
any
closet
or
any
cellar
might
be
opened
neither
the
bridal
chamber
nor
the
room
of
the
dead
was
sacred
on
the
approach
of
any
petty
customs
constable
or
deputy
in
whose
hands
a
writ
of
assistance
had
been
placed
the
antecedent
proceedings
required
no
affidavit
or
any
other
legal
formality
the
object
was
to
lay
bare
the
whole
privacy
of
a
people
on
sheer
suspicion
of
smuggling
it
could
hardly
be
supposed
that
our
fathers
would
tamely
submit
to
such
an
odious
and
despotic
procedure
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
to
subscribe
to
a
statute
for
their
own
enslavement
nor
may
we
pass
from
the
consideration
of
these
writs
and
the
resistance
offered
thereto
by
the
patriots
of
all
our
colonies
without
noticing
the
character
of
these
laws
of
a
certainty
englishmen
in
whatever
continent
or
island
of
this
world
would
never
tolerate
such
a
tyrannical
interference
with
their
rights
this
was
demonstrated
not
only
in
america
but
in
england
also
the
issuance
in
england
of
just
such
illegal
and
arbitrary
warrants
was
one
of
the
causes
that
led
to
the
tremendous
agitation
headed
by
john
wilkes
the
excitement
in
that
controversy
grew
and
notwithstanding
the
repeated
arrests
of
wilkes
and
his
expulsions
from
parliament
his
reelection
was
repeated
as
often
and
his
following
increased
until
not
only
the
ministry
but
the
throne
itself
was
shaken
by
the
cry
of
wilkes
and
liberty
nor
did
this
ebullition
of
human
rights
subside
until
the
arbitrary
warrants
were
annulled
by
a
decision
of
the
king
bench
it
was
the
trial
of
this
issue
in
america
that
brought
on
the
revolution
it
was
a
great
cause
that
had
to
be
pleaded
and
the
occasion
and
the
city
and
the
man
were
as
great
as
the
cause
the
parties
to
it
were
clearly
defined
and
were
set
in
sharp
antagonism
on
the
one
side
were
the
king
officers
in
the
province
headed
by
the
governor
this
following
included
the
officers
of
the
customs
in
particular
it
also
included
the
not
inconsiderable
class
of
american
respectabilities
who
were
feeble
in
american
sentiments
and
who
belonged
by
nature
and
affiliation
to
the
established
order
these
were
the
loyalists
destined
to
be
designated
as
tories
and
to
become
the
bete
noire
of
patriotism
on
the
other
side
was
a
whole
phalanx
of
the
common
people
a
phalanx
bounded
on
the
popular
side
by
the
outskirt
of
society
and
on
the
side
by
the
intellectual
and
philosophical
patriots
who
were
as
pronounced
as
any
for
the
cause
of
their
country
and
with
better
reason
than
the
reason
of
the
many
the
officers
of
the
province
elected
by
the
home
folks
were
all
patriots
but
the
appointed
officers
of
the
crown
were
quite
unanimous
for
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
holding
severe
measures
should
be
taken
with
the
resisting
colonists
and
in
particular
that
the
writs
of
assistance
were
good
law
and
correct
policy
we
should
here
note
the
particular
play
of
the
personal
forces
in
the
year
there
were
two
notable
deaths
the
one
notable
in
massachusetts
and
the
other
in
the
world
the
first
was
that
of
chief
justice
stephen
sewall
of
massachusetts
and
the
other
was
that
of
his
majesty
george
ii
the
snuffy
old
drone
from
the
german
hive
as
he
is
described
by
the
autocrat
of
the
breakfast
table
the
first
was
succeeded
in
office
by
thomas
hutchinson
of
the
province
under
sir
fraucis
bernard
who
was
appointed
governor
in
this
notable
year
as
the
successor
of
thomas
pownall
who
had
succeeded
governor
william
shirley
hutchinson
to
use
the
adjective
which
john
adams
was
wont
to
apply
to
himself
and
other
patriots
to
the
manner
born
was
a
massachusettensian
he
had
sympathized
with
the
people
but
he
now
turned
against
them
before
judge
sewall
went
away
it
was
said
and
believed
that
governor
shirley
had
promised
the
place
of
chief
justice
when
the
same
should
be
vacant
to
no
other
than
colonel
james
otis
of
barnstable
father
of
the
subject
of
this
sketch
but
governor
bernard
shirley
second
successor
in
office
took
another
view
of
the
matter
and
appointed
hutchinson
to
the
high
office
of
chief
justice
it
was
the
belief
and
allegation
of
the
king
party
that
this
appointment
and
this
disappointment
the
first
of
hutchinson
and
the
second
of
colonel
otis
bore
heavily
on
all
the
otises
and
indeed
converted
them
from
royalism
to
patriotism
chief
justice
hutchinson
himself
is
on
record
to
this
effect
in
his
history
of
massachusetts
speaking
of
his
own
appointment
to
the
judicial
office
he
says
the
expected
opposition
ensued
both
gentlemen
that
is
colonel
otis
and
james
otis
had
been
friends
to
the
government
from
this
time
they
were
at
the
head
of
every
measure
in
opposition
not
merely
in
those
points
which
concerned
the
governor
in
his
administration
but
in
such
as
concerned
the
authority
of
parliament
the
opposition
to
which
first
began
in
this
colony
and
was
moved
and
conducted
by
one
of
them
both
in
the
assembly
and
the
town
of
boston
from
so
small
a
spark
a
great
fire
seems
to
have
been
kindled
the
statement
of
a
partisan
especially
if
he
be
a
beneficiary
must
be
taken
with
the
usual
allowance
of
salt
it
may
be
that
the
patriotic
trend
of
the
otises
was
intensified
a
little
by
a
personal
pique
in
the
matter
referred
to
but
that
either
father
or
son
was
transferred
from
the
king
party
to
the
people
party
by
the
failure
of
colonel
otis
to
be
appointed
chief
justice
is
not
to
be
believed
other
stories
are
to
be
dismissed
in
the
same
manner
one
slander
prevalent
about
the
custom
house
ran
to
the
effect
that
james
otis
had
declared
that
he
would
set
the
province
on
fire
even
if
he
had
to
perish
in
the
flames
the
art
of
political
lying
was
known
even
among
our
fathers
such
was
the
situation
of
affairs
when
the
sycophants
of
the
foreign
government
in
boston
undertook
to
enforce
the
writs
of
assistance
they
soon
found
that
they
needed
more
assistance
to
do
it
the
banded
merchants
and
the
patriots
generally
said
that
the
acts
were
illegal
and
that
they
would
not
submit
to
the
officers
the
governor
and
his
subordinates
and
the
retinue
in
particular
said
that
the
writs
were
legal
and
that
they
should
be
enforced
the
matter
came
to
a
clash
and
a
trial
the
case
as
made
up
presented
this
question
shall
the
persons
employed
in
enforcing
the
acts
of
trade
have
the
power
to
invoke
generally
the
assistance
of
all
the
executive
officers
of
the
colony
this
issue
was
in
february
of
taken
into
court
in
the
old
town
house
afterwards
the
old
state
house
of
boston
there
were
sitting
the
five
judges
of
the
superior
court
of
the
province
chief
justice
hutchinson
still
holding
the
office
of
his
membership
in
the
council
and
his
position
of
judge
of
probate
presided
at
the
trial
perhaps
there
was
never
in
america
an
instance
in
which
a
high
official
so
nearly
fulfilled
the
part
of
pooh
bah
the
trial
evoked
an
attendance
of
all
who
could
be
admitted
and
of
many
more
the
officers
of
the
crown
were
out
in
full
force
and
resolute
patriotism
completed
the
crowd
john
adams
was
one
of
the
spectators
another
element
in
the
dramatic
situation
was
the
fact
that
james
otis
had
in
the
meantime
received
the
appointment
to
the
crown
office
of
advocate
general
to
which
an
ample
salary
was
attached
in
this
relation
it
would
be
his
especial
duty
to
support
the
petition
of
the
officers
in
upholding
the
writs
of
assistance
and
in
constraining
the
executive
officers
of
the
province
to
support
them
in
doing
so
this
contingency
brought
out
the
mettle
of
the
man
when
the
revenue
officers
came
to
him
with
the
request
that
he
defend
their
case
he
at
once
resigned
his
office
and
this
being
known
the
merchants
immediately
sought
his
services
as
counsel
to
uphold
their
protest
against
the
writs
for
his
assistant
they
selected
oxenbridge
thatcher
otis
accepted
the
invitation
without
a
fee
his
action
involved
the
loss
of
his
official
position
as
well
as
his
means
of
living
it
chanced
at
this
time
that
his
old
law
preceptor
jeremiah
gridley
was
selected
as
king
attorney
and
it
fell
to
his
lot
to
take
the
place
which
otis
would
not
accept
thus
master
and
pupil
were
brought
face
to
face
at
the
bar
in
the
hottest
legal
encounter
which
preceded
our
rupture
with
the
mother
country
the
trial
that
ensued
has
been
described
by
john
adams
an
eye
witness
of
the
whole
proceedings
he
gives
in
his
works
a
description
of
the
conduct
of
the
case
as
it
was
presented
for
and
against
the
crown
and
also
notes
of
otis
argument
after
the
pleas
were
presented
and
other
preliminary
matters
arranged
gridley
addressed
the
court
in
support
of
the
government
position
he
defended
the
petition
of
the
officials
as
both
legal
and
just
two
statutes
of
the
time
of
charles
ii
empowering
the
court
of
exchequer
to
issue
writs
such
as
those
which
were
now
denied
were
adduced
he
then
cited
the
statute
of
the
sixth
year
of
queen
anne
which
continued
to
inforce
the
processes
which
had
been
authorized
in
the
twelfth
and
fourteenth
years
of
the
reign
of
charles
still
more
to
the
point
were
the
statutes
of
the
seventh
and
eighth
years
of
william
iii
which
authorized
the
collection
of
revenue
in
the
british
plantations
by
officers
who
might
search
both
public
and
private
houses
to
find
goods
that
had
evaded
the
duty
these
statutes
gridley
claimed
as
a
warrant
for
the
like
usage
in
america
in
answer
to
gridley
oxenbridge
thatcher
himself
a
lawyer
of
no
mean
abilities
spoke
for
the
counter
petitioners
his
plea
was
a
strong
confutation
of
gridley
arguments
after
this
brief
address
otis
rose
to
continue
the
plea
for
the
people
of
the
speech
which
followed
we
have
no
complete
record
or
wholly
satisfactory
summary
it
is
to
john
adams
and
to
the
notes
which
he
made
on
the
occasion
that
we
must
look
for
our
opinion
of
what
was
if
we
mistake
not
the
greatest
and
most
effective
oration
delivered
in
the
american
colonies
before
the
revolution
such
was
the
accepted
belief
of
those
who
heard
otis
and
witnessed
the
effect
of
his
tremendous
oratory
making
all
allowance
for
exaggeration
it
seems
to
have
been
one
of
those
inspired
appeals
by
which
history
and
providence
at
critical
epochs
make
themselves
known
to
mankind
john
adams
then
years
of
age
passing
from
his
notes
of
thatcher
speech
says
of
the
greater
actor
but
otis
was
a
flame
of
fire
with
a
promptitude
of
classical
allusions
a
depth
of
research
a
rapid
summary
of
historical
events
and
dates
a
profusion
of
legal
authorities
a
prophetic
glance
of
his
eyes
into
futurity
and
a
rapid
torrent
of
impetuous
eloquence
he
hurried
away
all
before
him
american
independence
was
then
and
there
born
the
seeds
of
patriots
and
heroes
to
defend
the
non
sine
diis
animosus
infans
to
defend
the
vigorous
youth
were
then
and
there
sown
every
man
of
an
immense
crowded
audience
appeared
to
me
to
go
away
as
i
did
ready
to
take
arms
against
writs
of
assistance
then
and
there
was
the
first
scene
of
the
first
act
of
opposition
to
the
arbitrary
claims
of
great
britain
then
and
there
the
child
independence
was
born
in
fifteen
years
that
is
in
he
grew
up
to
manhood
and
declared
himself
free
we
may
allow
a
little
for
the
enthusiasm
of
a
young
patriot
such
as
adams
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
unmeasured
eulogy
was
well
deserved
such
was
the
description
of
otis
speech
as
to
the
speech
itself
we
have
only
a
and
inadequate
report
minot
in
his
history
of
massachusetts
presents
what
purports
to
be
a
tolerably
full
outline
of
the
great
address
otis
spoke
for
five
hours
during
which
time
with
his
rather
rapid
utterance
he
would
perhaps
deliver
an
oration
of
words
minot
report
appears
to
have
been
derived
from
notes
done
into
full
form
by
an
unknown
writer
who
probably
put
in
here
and
there
some
rather
florid
paragraphs
of
his
own
at
a
subsequent
period
adams
took
up
the
subject
and
corrected
minot
report
giving
the
revised
address
to
william
tudor
who
used
the
same
in
his
biography
of
james
otis
from
these
sources
we
are
able
to
present
a
fair
abstract
of
what
were
the
leading
parts
of
otis
speech
in
the
beginning
he
said
may
it
please
your
honors
i
was
desired
by
one
of
the
court
to
look
into
the
books
and
consider
the
question
now
before
them
concerning
writs
of
assistance
i
have
accordingly
considered
it
and
now
appear
not
only
in
obedience
to
your
order
but
likewise
in
behalf
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
town
who
have
present
another
petition
and
out
of
regard
to
the
liberties
of
the
subject
and
i
take
this
liberty
to
declare
that
whether
under
a
fee
or
not
for
in
such
a
cause
as
this
i
despise
a
fee
i
will
to
my
dying
day
oppose
with
all
the
powers
and
faculties
god
has
given
me
all
such
instruments
of
slavery
on
the
one
hand
and
villainy
on
the
other
as
this
writ
of
assistance
is
it
appears
to
me
the
worst
instrument
of
arbitrary
power
the
most
destructive
of
english
liberty
and
the
fundamental
principles
of
law
that
was
ever
found
in
an
english
i
must
therefore
beg
your
honors
patience
and
attention
to
the
whole
range
of
an
argument
that
may
perhaps
appear
uncommon
in
many
things
as
well
as
to
points
of
learning
that
are
more
remote
and
unusual
that
the
whole
tendency
of
my
design
may
the
more
easily
be
perceived
the
conclusions
better
descend
and
the
force
of
them
be
better
felt
i
shall
not
think
much
of
my
pains
in
this
case
as
i
engaged
in
it
from
principle
i
was
solicited
to
argue
this
case
as
and
because
i
would
not
i
have
been
charged
with
desertion
from
my
office
to
this
charge
i
can
give
a
very
sufficient
answer
i
renounced
that
office
and
i
argue
this
case
from
the
same
principle
and
i
argue
it
with
the
greater
pleasure
as
it
is
in
favor
of
british
liberty
at
a
time
when
we
hear
the
greatest
monarch
upon
earth
declaring
from
his
throne
that
he
glories
in
the
name
of
briton
and
that
the
privileges
of
his
people
are
dearer
to
him
than
the
most
valuable
prerogatives
of
his
crown
and
it
is
in
opposition
to
a
kind
of
power
the
exercise
of
which
in
former
periods
of
english
history
cost
one
king
of
england
his
head
and
another
his
throne
i
have
taken
more
pains
in
this
case
than
i
ever
will
take
again
although
my
engaging
in
this
and
another
popular
case
has
raised
much
resentment
but
i
think
i
can
sincerely
declare
that
i
cheerfully
submit
myself
to
every
odious
name
for
conscience
sake
and
from
my
soul
i
despise
all
those
whose
guilt
malice
or
folly
has
made
them
my
foes
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
will
i
am
determined
to
proceed
the
only
principles
of
public
conduct
that
are
worthy
of
a
gentleman
or
a
man
are
to
sacrifice
estate
ease
health
and
applause
and
even
life
to
the
sacred
calls
of
his
country
these
manly
sentiments
in
private
life
make
the
good
citizen
in
public
life
the
patriot
and
the
hero
i
do
not
say
that
when
brought
to
the
test
i
shall
be
invincible
i
pray
god
i
may
never
be
brought
to
the
melancholy
trial
but
if
ever
i
should
it
will
then
be
known
how
far
i
can
reduce
to
practice
principles
which
i
know
to
be
founded
in
truth
in
the
meantime
i
will
proceed
to
the
subject
of
this
writ
after
this
introductory
part
we
are
obliged
to
fall
back
on
the
summary
given
by
adams
according
to
his
report
otis
in
the
next
place
went
into
fundamentals
and
discussed
the
rights
of
man
in
a
state
of
nature
in
this
part
the
argument
ran
in
an
analagous
vein
to
that
of
rousseau
in
the
contrat
social
that
is
man
in
the
first
place
is
a
sovereign
subject
only
to
the
higher
laws
revealed
in
his
own
conscience
in
this
state
he
has
a
right
to
life
to
liberty
to
property
here
the
speaker
fell
into
the
manner
of
jefferson
in
the
opening
paragraphs
of
the
declaration
it
is
to
be
noted
that
otis
presented
the
truth
absolutely
he
including
negroes
in
the
common
humanity
to
whom
inalienable
rights
belong
otis
next
took
up
the
social
compact
and
showed
that
society
is
the
individual
enlarged
and
generalized
this
brought
him
to
the
question
before
the
court
for
the
conflict
now
on
was
a
struggle
of
society
endowed
with
inalienable
rights
against
arbitrary
authority
and
its
abusive
exercise
the
abusive
exercise
was
shown
in
the
attempts
to
enforce
the
acts
of
trade
of
this
kind
was
the
old
navigation
act
and
of
like
character
was
the
importation
act
it
was
to
enforce
these
that
the
writs
of
assistance
had
been
devised
otis
then
continued
your
honors
will
find
in
the
old
books
concerning
the
office
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
precedents
of
general
warrants
to
search
suspected
houses
but
in
more
modern
books
you
will
find
only
special
warrants
to
search
such
and
such
houses
specially
named
in
which
the
complainant
has
before
sworn
that
he
suspects
his
goods
are
concealed
and
will
find
it
adjudged
that
special
warrants
only
are
legal
in
the
same
manner
i
rely
in
it
that
the
writ
prayed
for
in
this
petition
being
general
is
illegal
it
is
a
power
that
places
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
the
hands
of
every
petty
officer
i
say
i
admit
that
special
writs
of
assistance
to
search
special
places
may
be
granted
to
certain
persons
on
oath
but
i
deny
that
the
writ
now
prayed
for
can
be
granted
for
i
beg
leave
to
make
some
observations
on
the
writ
itself
before
i
proceed
to
other
acts
of
parliament
in
the
first
place
the
writ
is
universal
being
directed
to
and
singular
justices
sheriffs
constables
and
all
other
officers
and
subjects
so
that
in
short
it
is
directed
to
every
subject
in
the
king
dominions
every
one
with
this
writ
may
be
a
tyrant
in
a
legal
manner
and
may
control
imprison
or
murder
any
one
within
the
realm
in
the
next
place
it
is
perpetual
there
is
no
return
a
man
is
accountable
to
no
person
for
his
doings
every
man
may
reign
secure
in
his
petty
tyranny
and
spread
terror
and
desolation
around
him
until
the
trump
of
the
archangel
shall
excite
different
emotions
in
his
soul
in
the
third
place
a
person
with
this
writ
in
the
daytime
may
enter
all
houses
shops
at
will
and
command
all
to
assist
him
fourthly
by
this
writ
not
only
deputies
but
even
their
menial
servants
are
allowed
to
lord
it
over
us
what
is
this
but
to
have
the
curse
of
canaan
with
a
witness
on
us
to
be
the
servant
of
servants
the
most
despicable
of
god
creation
now
one
of
the
most
essential
branches
of
english
liberty
is
the
freedom
of
one
house
a
man
house
is
his
castle
and
whilst
he
is
quiet
he
is
as
well
guarded
as
a
prince
in
his
castle
this
writ
if
it
should
be
declared
legal
would
totally
annihilate
this
privilege
officers
may
enter
our
houses
when
they
please
we
are
commanded
to
permit
their
entry
their
menial
servants
may
enter
may
break
locks
bars
and
every
thing
in
their
way
and
whether
they
break
through
malice
or
revenge
no
man
no
court
can
inquire
bare
suspicion
without
oath
is
sufficient
this
wanton
exercise
of
this
power
is
not
a
chimerical
suggestion
of
a
heated
brain
i
will
mention
some
facts
pew
had
one
of
these
writs
and
when
ware
succeeded
him
he
endorsed
this
writ
over
to
ware
so
that
these
writs
are
negotiable
from
one
officer
to
another
and
so
your
honors
have
no
opportunity
of
judging
the
persons
to
whom
this
vast
power
is
delegated
another
instance
is
this
justice
walley
had
called
this
same
ware
before
him
by
a
constable
to

and

this
extract
may
serve
to
show
the
demosthenic
power
of
james
otis
as
an
orator
we
can
not
within
our
limits
present
many
additional
paragraphs
from
his
great
plea
in
the
cause
of
his
countrymen
to
the
next
division
of
his
argument
he
confuted
the
position
taken
by
gridley
with
respect
to
the
alleged
legal
precedents
for
the
writs
of
assistance
he
showed
that
the
writs
were
wholly
different
from
those
provided
for
in
the
time
of
charles
ii
even
if
they
had
not
been
so
the
epoch
and
the
manner
of
king
charles
had
passed
away
neither
could
the
writs
be
justified
by
inferences
and
constructions
deduced
from
any
previous
statutes
of
parliament
besides
such
odious
writs
could
never
be
enforced
they
could
never
be
enforced
in
the
city
of
the
pilgrims
if
the
king
of
england
should
himself
encamp
with
twenty
thousand
soldiers
on
the
common
of
boston
he
could
not
enforce
such
laws
he
assailed
the
sugar
tax
with
unmeasured
invective
and
over
and
above
all
this
despotic
legislation
was
in
direct
conflict
with
the
charter
of
massachusetts
here
the
orator
broke
forth
in
his
most
impassioned
strain
declaring
that
the
british
king
the
british
parliament
and
the
british
nation
were
all
guilty
of
ingratitude
and
oppression
in
attempting
to
impose
tyrannical
enactment
on
the
people
of
america
thus
he
concluded
his
argument
appeal
those
who
heard
the
oration
were
convulsed
with
excitement
the
king
party
was
enraged
the
patriots
were
inspired
and
defiant
it
was
in
every
respect
a
critical
and
a
historic
hour
what
would
the
court
do
with
the
case
the
action
of
that
body
was
obscure
and
double
there
seems
to
have
been
a
disposition
of
the
associate
judges
to
decide
for
the
but
chief
justice
hutchinson
induced
them
to
assent
to
his
policy
of
withholding
a
decision
he
accordingly
announced
that
the
court
would
decide
the
case
at
the
ensuing
session
he
then
wrote
to
the
home
government
and
the
records
show
that
the
decision
was
rendered
for
the
petitioners
that
is
for
the
custom
house
officials
and
in
favor
of
the
writs
the
chief
justice
is
also
on
record
to
the
effect
that
he
continued
to
issue
the
writs
but
if
so
no
officer
of
the
king
ever
dared
to
present
one
of
them
in
boston
the
famous
and
infamous
writs
of
assistance
were
as
dead
as
the
mummies
of
egypt
it
is
from
this
point
of
view
that
the
character
and
work
of
james
otis
appear
to
the
greatest
historical
advantage
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
was
the
living
voice
which
called
to
resistance
first
boston
then
massachusetts
then
new
england
and
then
the
world
for
ultimately
the
world
heard
the
sound
thereof
and
was
glad
the
american
colonies
resisted
and
at
length
won
their
independence
the
sparks
fell
in
france
and
the
jets
of
flame
ran
together
in
a
conflagration
the
light
of
which
was
seen
over
europe
and
if
over
europe
then
over
the
world
the
had
cried
out
and
mankind
heard
him
resistance
to
tyranny
became
obedience
to
god
we
shall
here
sketch
rapidly
and
briefly
the
unsteady
way
and
unfortunate
decline
of
james
otis
down
to
the
time
of
the
eclipse
of
his
intellect
and
his
tragic
death
three
months
after
he
had
according
to
john
adams
breathed
into
the
nation
the
breath
of
life
he
was
chosen
to
represent
boston
in
the
legislature
of
the
commonwealth
all
of
his
colleagues
were
patriots
boston
was
in
that
mood
there
runs
a
story
that
when
he
was
entering
upon
his
duties
he
was
counselled
by
a
friend
to
curb
his
impetuosity
and
to
gain
leadership
by
the
mastery
of
self
advice
most
salutary
to
one
of
his
temperament
but
it
was
much
like
advising
general
putnam
to
be
calm
at
bunker
hill
otis
promised
however
that
if
his
friends
would
warn
him
when
his
temperature
was
rising
he
would
command
himself
it
is
also
narrated
that
his
friends
did
attempt
to
pluck
him
by
the
coat
but
he
turned
upon
them
demanding
to
know
if
he
was
a
school
boy
to
be
called
down
at
this
time
the
relations
between
governor
bernard
and
the
legislature
were
greatly
strained
otis
rather
increased
the
tension
a
question
arose
about
a
financial
measure
whereby
gold
was
to
be
exported
and
silver
money
retained
as
the
currency
of
the
colony
the
former
at
less
than
its
nominal
value
in
a
manner
to
juggle
the
people
into
paying
their
obligations
twice
over
the
argument
became
hot
and
the
council
taking
the
side
of
the
administration
was
opposed
by
the
legislative
assembly
chief
justice
hutchinson
and
james
otis
got
into
a
controversy
which
was
bitter
enough
and
which
may
be
illustrated
with
the
following
letter
which
james
otis
addressed
to
the
printer
of
a
newspaper
perhaps
i
should
not
have
troubled
you
or
the
public
with
any
thoughts
of
mine
had
not
his
honor
the
condescended
to
give
me
a
personal
challenge
this
is
an
honor
that
i
never
had
vanity
enough
to
aspire
after
and
i
shall
ever
respect
hutchinson
for
it
so
long
as
i
live
as
he
certainly
consulted
my
reputation
more
than
his
own
when
he
bestowed
it
a
general
officer
in
the
army
would
be
thought
very
condescending
to
accept
much
more
to
give
a
challenge
to
a
subaltern
the
honor
of
entering
the
lists
with
a
gentleman
so
much
superior
in
one
view
is
certainly
tempting
it
is
at
least
possible
that
his
honor
may
lose
much
but
from
those
who
have
and
desire
but
little
but
little
can
possibly
be
taken
away
i
am
your
humble
servant
james
otis
this
controversy
continued
for
some
time
and
it
is
thought
that
to
it
must
be
attributed
much
of
the
animosity
displayed
by
the
chief
justice
towards
otis
in
the
history
of
massachusetts
bay
otis
continued
his
aggressive
policy
in
the
session
of
the
assembly
held
in
it
was
at
this
session
that
the
government
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
sum
of
money
adopted
the
ruse
of
creating
an
alarm
relative
to
a
french
invasion
of
newfoundland
but
the
patriots
would
have
none
of
it
they
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
arbitrary
government
was
to
be
established
in
america
it
made
no
difference
whether
the
americans
should
have
king
stork
or
king
log
to
this
effect
ran
a
resolution
offered
by
james
otis
no
necessity
can
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
house
of
representatives
in
giving
up
such
a
privilege
for
it
would
be
of
little
consequence
to
the
people
whether
they
were
subject
to
george
or
louis
the
king
of
great
britain
or
the
french
king
if
both
were
arbitrary
as
both
would
be
if
both
could
levy
taxes
without
parliament
it
is
said
that
when
this
resolution
was
offered
a
loyalist
member
cried
out
in
the
virginian
manner
treason
treason
it
was
in
this
way
that
otis
gained
the
undying
enmity
of
the
king
party
in
america
it
was
in
the
period
following
his
legislative
service
that
james
otis
prepared
his
powerful
pamphlet
entitled
a
vindication
of
the
conduct
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
province
of
the
massachusetts
bay
in
this
work
he
traverses
and
justifies
the
course
pursued
by
the
patriot
legislature
during
the
sessions
of
his
attendance
great
was
the
joy
of
the
american
colonies
at
the
conclusion
of
the
french
and
indian
war
the
treaty
of
paris
in
february
of
conceded
canada
to
great
britain
and
insured
the
predominance
of
english
institutions
in
the
new
world
the
animosities
of
the
americans
towards
the
mother
country
rapidly
subsided
meetings
were
held
in
the
principal
towns
to
ratify
the
peace
at
the
jubilee
in
boston
james
otis
presided
he
made
on
the
occasion
one
of
his
notable
addresses
he
referred
with
enthusiasm
to
the
expulsion
of
the
heathen
meaning
the
french
and
then
expressed
sentiments
of
strong
affection
for
great
britain
and
appreciation
of
the
filial
relations
of
the
american
colonies
to
her
in
these
utterances
otis
reflected
the
sentiment
of
the
bostonians
and
of
the
whole
people
the
general
assembly
of
massachusetts
took
up
the
theme
and
passed
resolutions
of
gratitude
and
loyalty
at
this
particular
juncture
the
americans
did
not
anticipate
what
was
soon
to
follow
the
english
ministry
was
already
preparing
a
scheme
for
the
raising
of
revenue
in
america
the
question
of
the
right
of
taxation
suddenly
obtruded
itself
the
americans
claimed
the
right
as
englishmen
to
tax
themselves
the
english
ministers
replied
that
parliament
and
not
the
colonial
assemblies
was
the
proper
body
to
vote
taxes
in
any
and
all
parts
of
the
british
empire
the
americans
replied
that
they
were
not
represented
in
parliament
parliament
replied
that
many
of
the
towns
shires
and
boroughs
in
england
were
not
represented
if
they
were
not
represented
they
ought
to
be
said
the
americans
and
thus
the
case
was
made
up
by
the
beginning
of
it
was
known
that
the
ministers
had
determined
to
make
a
rigorous
enforcement
of
the
sugar
act
than
this
nothing
could
be
more
odious
to
america
in
the
spring
of
the
year
just
named
the
citizens
of
boston
held
a
great
meeting
to
protest
against
the
impending
policy
of
the
crown
as
a
member
of
the
assembly
and
as
chairman
of
a
committee
otis
made
a
report
which
was
ordered
to
be
sent
to
the
agent
of
the
government
along
with
the
copy
of
otis
recent
pamphlet
the
rights
of
the
british
colonies
asserted
and
proved
at
this
time
hutchinson
was
about
to
become
the
representative
of
the
colony
in
its
contention
with
the
crown
and
for
some
reason
not
very
apparent
otis
favored
his
appointment
governor
bernard
however
opposed
the
measure
and
hutchinson
declined
the
appointment
otis
course
was
censured
by
the
patriots
and
his
popularity
was
for
the
while
impaired
however
he
took
strong
grounds
against
the
sugar
act
and
soon
afterward
still
more
strenuously
opposed
the
stamp
act
he
regained
the
impaired
confidence
of
the
people
and
at
the
close
of
the
session
of
the
assembly
he
was
appointed
chairman
of
a
committee
to
correspond
with
the
other
colonies
and
thus
to
promote
the
common
interest
of
all
this
after
the
intercolonial
conference
which
franklin
had
promoted
was
perhaps
the
first
step
towards
the
creation
of
the
continental
congress
otis
letter
to
the
provincial
agent
went
to
england
though
it
was
sent
in
the
name
of
the
lower
house
only
in
this
document
the
writer
said
granting
the
time
may
come
which
we
hope
is
far
off
when
the
british
parliament
shall
think
fit
to
oblige
the
north
americans
not
only
to
maintain
civil
government
among
themselves
for
this
they
have
already
done
but
to
support
an
army
to
protect
them
can
it
be
possible
that
the
duties
to
be
imposed
and
the
taxes
to
be
levied
shall
be
assessed
without
the
voice
or
consent
of
one
american
in
parliament
if
we
are
not
represented
we
are
slaves
this
document
was
one
of
the
few
american
papers
which
was
read
and
criticized
in
the
british
parliament
the
merits
of
otis
pamphlet
were
actually
debated
in
the
house
of
lords
by
lord
littleton
and
lord
mansfield
the
latter
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
said
otis
is
a
man
of
consequence
among
the
people
there
they
have
chosen
him
for
one
of
their
deputies
at
the
congress
and
general
meeting
from
the
respective
governments
it
is
said
the
man
is
mad
what
then
one
madman
often
makes
many
massaniello
was
mad
nobody
doubts
yet
for
all
that
he
overturned
the
government
of
naples
madness
is
catching
in
all
popular
assemblies
and
upon
all
popular
matters
the
book
is
full
of
wildness
i
never
read
it
till
a
few
days
ago
for
i
seldom
look
into
such
things
it
was
in
the
course
of
this
pamphlet
that
the
otis
spoke
so
strongly
on
taxation
and
representation
the
very
act
of
taxing
said
he
exercised
over
those
who
are
not
represented
appears
to
me
to
be
depriving
them
of
one
of
their
most
essential
rights
and
if
continued
seems
to
be
in
effect
an
entire
disfranchisement
of
every
civil
right
for
what
one
civil
right
is
worth
a
rush
after
a
man
property
is
subject
to
be
taken
from
him
at
pleasure
without
his
consent
in
this
was
the
germ
of
the
stern
resistance
offered
by
the
americans
to
the
stamp
act
no
man
in
the
colonies
did
so
much
to
confute
the
principles
on
which
the
stamp
act
rested
as
did
james
otis
when
the
general
assembly
of
massachusetts
met
in
may
of
governor
bernard
urged
in
his
address
the
duty
of
submission
to
parliament
as
to
the
conservators
of
liberty
it
was
this
recommendation
which
being
referred
to
a
committee
of
which
otis
was
a
member
led
to
the
adoption
of
a
resolution
for
the
holding
of
a
colonial
congress
in
new
york
nine
colonies
accepted
the
invitation
of
massachusetts
and
james
otis
headed
the
delegation
of
three
members
chosen
to
represent
the
mother
colony
in
that
prophetic
body
the
story
of
the
contest
of
the
americans
with
the
home
government
on
the
subject
of
the
stamp
act
is
well
known
the
controversy
resulted
on
the
of
march
in
the
repeal
of
the
act
by
parliament
but
the
repeal
was
accompanied
with
a
salvo
to
british
obduracy
in
the
form
of
a
declaration
that
parliament
had
the
right
to
bind
the
colonies
in
all
cases
whatsoever
notwithstanding
this
hateful
addendum
the
repeal
of
the
act
was
received
in
america
with
the
greatest
joy
during
the
excitement
antecedent
to
the
repeal
mobs
had
surged
through
the
streets
of
boston
building
bonfires
and
burning
effigies
of
officers
and
other
adherents
of
the
king
party
in
one
of
these
ebullitions
the
house
of
hutchinson
was
attacked
and
pillaged
the
better
people
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
many
were
arrested
and
imprisoned
governor
bernard
was
so
much
alarmed
that
he
declared
himself
to
be
a
governor
only
in
name
the
partisans
of
the
crown
started
a
story
that
james
otis
was
the
instigator
of
the
riots
there
is
a
hint
to
this
effect
in
hutchinson
history
of
massachusetts
bay
but
it
is
evident
that
the
charge
was
unfounded
except
in
this
that
in
times
of
public
excitement
the
utterances
of
orators
are
frequently
wrested
from
their
purpose
by
the
ignorant
and
made
to
do
service
in
the
cause
of
anarchy
meanwhile
on
the
first
of
november
otis
returned
from
the
congress
in
new
york
laid
a
copy
of
the
proceedings
before
the
assembly
and
was
formally
thanked
for
his
services
during
the
stamp
act
year
otis
found
time
to
compose
two
pamphlets
setting
forth
his
views
on
the
great
questions
of
the
day
there
had
recently
appeared
a
letter
written
by
a
halifax
gentleman
and
addressed
to
a
rhode
island
friend
the
latter
personage
was
unknown
the
former
was
ascertained
to
be
a
certain
howard
the
letter
was
written
with
much
ability
and
in
a
bitter
spirit
to
this
otis
replied
with
great
asperity
and
with
his
power
of
invective
untrammeled
he
called
his
pamphlet
a
vindication
of
the
british
colonies
against
the
aspersions
of
the
halifax
gentleman
in
his
letter
to
a
rhode
island
friend
a
single
passage
from
the
work
may
serve
to
show
the
cogency
of
the
writer
style
and
especially
his
anticipation
of
the
doctrines
of
the
declaration
of
independence
is
the
gentleman
said
he
a
subject
and
a
lawyer
and
ignorant
that
charters
from
the
crown
have
usually
been
given
for
enlarging
the
liberties
and
privileges
of
the
grantees
not
for
limiting
them
much
less
for
curtailing
those
essential
rights
which
all
his
majesty
subjects
are
entitled
to
by
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
as
well
as
by
the
common
law
and
by
the
constitution
of
their
country
the
gentleman
positions
and
principles
if
true
would
afford
a
curious
train
of
consequences
life
liberty
and
property
are
by
the
law
of
nature
as
well
as
by
the
common
law
secured
to
the
happy
inhabitants
of
south
britain
and
constitute
their
primary
civil
or
political
rights
the
other
pamphlet
bearing
date
of
september
was
entitled
considerations
on
behalf
of
the
colonists
in
a
letter
to
a
noble
lord
in
this
the
writer
discusses
the
question
of
taxation
and
in
particular
the
specious
claim
of
the
british
ministry
that
the
home
government
might
justly
tax
the
colonists
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
french
and
indian
war
in
answer
to
this
otis
says
in
a
manner
worthy
of
an
american
patriot
in
the
year
the
national
debt
is
confessed
on
all
hands
to
be
a
terrible
evil
and
may
in
time
ruin
the
state
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
colonies
never
occasioned
its
increase
nor
ever
reaped
any
of
the
sweet
fruits
of
involving
the
finest
kingdom
in
the
world
in
the
sad
calamity
of
an
enormous
overgrown
mortgage
to
state
and
the
period
here
under
consideration
was
that
in
which
the
stamp
act
was
nominally
in
force
the
law
required
all
legal
business
to
be
done
on
stamped
paper
therefore
no
legal
business
was
done
hutchinson
in
his
history
says
no
wills
were
proved
no
administrations
granted
no
deeds
nor
bonds
executed
of
course
matters
could
not
go
on
in
this
manner
forever
governor
bernard
was
induced
to
call
the
legislature
together
when
that
body
convened
an
answer
to
the
governor
previous
message
was
adopted
by
the
house
and
the
answer
was
the
work
of
james
otis
an
extract
will
show
the
temper
of
the
people
at
that
juncture
the
courts
of
justice
must
be
open
open
immediately
and
the
law
the
great
rule
of
right
in
every
county
in
the
province
executed
the
stopping
the
courts
of
justice
is
a
grievance
which
this
house
must
inquire
into
justice
must
be
fully
administered
through
the
province
by
which
the
shocking
effects
which
your
excellency
apprehended
from
the
with
the
stamp
act
will
be
prevented
meanwhile
the
public
agitation
continued
the
newspapers
teemed
with
controversy
the
administration
was
firm
but
patriotism
was
rampant
the
party
of
the
people
adopted
the
policy
of
embarrassing
the
government
as
much
as
possible
then
came
the
news
of
the
repeal
of
the
act
and
the
jubilation
of
the
people
to
which
we
have
already
referred
came
after
when
the
legislature
met
in
may
of
james
otis
was
chosen
speaker
but
his
election
was
vetoed
by
the
governor
the
house
was
obliged
to
submit
which
it
did
in
sullen
temper
and
then
chose
thomas
cushing
for
its
presiding
officer
the
other
elections
indicated
the
patriotic
purpose
of
the
house
there
was
almost
a
deadlock
between
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
governor
bernard
addressed
the
representatives
in
a
supercilious
and
dogmatic
manner
which
they
for
their
part
resented
with
scant
courtesy
on
one
occasion
they
said
the
language
being
otis
in
a
concluding
paragraph
with
regard
to
the
rest
of
your
excellency
speech
we
are
sorry
we
are
constrained
to
observe
that
the
general
air
and
style
of
it
savor
much
more
of
an
act
of
free
grace
and
pardon
than
of
a
parliamentary
address
to
the
two
houses
of
assembly
and
we
most
sincerely
wish
your
excellency
had
been
pleased
to
reserve
it
if
needful
for
a
proclamation
the
state
papers
on
affairs
at
least
that
portion
of
them
emanating
from
the
legislative
department
were
up
to
the
year
nearly
all
prepared
by
otis
but
it
was
generally
necessary
to
tone
down
the
first
drafts
of
his
work
for
this
duty
the
speaker
thomas
cushing
and
samuel
adams
were
generally
selected
it
was
reckoned
necessary
to
put
the
damper
on
the
fire
the
popular
tendency
at
this
time
was
illustrated
in
a
proposition
made
by
otis
to
open
the
gallery
of
the
house
to
such
of
the
people
as
might
wish
to
hear
the
debates
otis
continued
his
correspondence
a
great
deal
of
which
was
official
his
style
and
spirit
suited
the
temper
of
the
representatives
and
they
kept
him
occupied
as
chairman
of
a
committee
to
answer
messages
from
the
government
and
indeed
messages
from
anybody
who
might
assail
the
patriot
party
in
the
meantime
the
animosity
between
him
and
the
governor
of
the
province
waxed
hot
the
governor
constantly
charged
the
patriot
leader
with
being
an
incendiary
and
the
latter
replied
in
a
manner
to
convict
governor
bernard
of
despotic
usages
and
a
spirit
hostile
to
american
liberty
the
next
measure
adopted
by
parliament
inimical
to
the
colonies
was
the
act
of
imposing
duties
on
glass
paper
colors
and
tea
and
appointing
a
commission
for
the
special
purpose
of
collecting
the
revenues
the
commissioners
so
appointed
were
to
reside
in
the
colonies
this
measure
hardly
less
odious
than
the
stamp
act
was
strangely
enough
resisted
with
less
vehemence
several
of
the
popular
leaders
were
disposed
to
counsel
moderation
among
these
was
otis
himself
but
nearly
all
outside
of
the
official
circles
were
united
against
the
new
act
they
formed
associations
and
signed
agreements
not
to
use
any
of
the
articles
on
which
the
duty
was
imposed
this
was
equivalent
to
making
the
act
of
no
effect
in
the
legislative
assembly
of
otis
was
appointed
with
samuel
adams
to
prepare
an
important
paper
on
the
state
of
public
affairs
this
they
did
by
drawing
up
a
petition
which
has
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
ablest
of
its
kind
there
is
some
controversy
as
to
who
actually
wrote
this
famous
paper
but
it
appears
to
have
been
done
mostly
by
otis
though
the
refining
hand
of
samuel
adams
may
be
clearly
seen
in
the
style
the
publication
of
the
paper
still
further
strained
the
relations
between
governor
bernard
and
the
representative
branch
meanwhile
the
news
of
the
assembling
of
the
colonial
congress
in
new
york
had
produced
a
sensation
in
england
and
the
petition
of
the
massachusetts
legislature
added
to
the
temper
of
the
ministry
in
may
of
bernard
sent
to
the
assembly
a
requisition
that
that
body
should
rescind
the
resolution
which
they
had
passed
for
sending
a
circular
letter
to
the
other
colonies
to
this
otis
acting
for
the
assembly
prepared
a
reply
which
while
it
was
not
less
severe
was
more
respectful
and
concessive
than
were
most
of
his
communications
at
the
conclusion
he
says
we
have
now
only
to
inform
your
excellency
that
this
house
have
voted
not
to
rescind
as
required
the
resolution
of
the
last
house
and
that
upon
a
decision
on
the
question
there
were
nays
and
seventeen
yeas
in
this
manner
the
controversy
dragged
on
through
the
years
but
in
the
summer
of
the
former
year
an
event
occurred
which
roused
the
people
to
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
some
of
the
officers
seized
a
vessel
belonging
to
john
hancock
for
this
they
were
assailed
by
a
mob
which
burned
the
boat
of
the
collector
of
customs
the
officers
fled
to
the
castle
it
was
for
this
business
that
a
body
of
british
soldiers
was
first
sent
to
boston
on
the
of
september
a
great
meeting
was
held
in
faneuil
hall
but
the
crowd
was
such
as
to
make
necessary
and
adjournment
to
sewall
james
otis
was
moderator
of
the
meeting
the
presence
of
british
soldiers
evidently
sent
to
boston
to
enforce
the
decrees
of
an
arbitrary
government
was
sufficient
to
bring
into
play
all
the
elements
of
patriotism
the
british
soldier
coat
in
the
old
town
was
of
the
same
color
as
the
scarf
which
the
picador
shakes
in
the
face
of
the
enraged
animal
the
effect
in
either
case
was
the
same
at
the
meeting
just
mentioned
otis
presided
and
spoke
a
report
of
what
occurred
was
written
presumptively
by
some
enemy
of
the
patriots
and
was
sent
as
a
report
to
the
british
ministry
in
this
otis
was
charged
with
saying
in
case
great
britain
is
not
disposed
to
redress
our
grievances
after
proper
application
the
people
have
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
gird
the
sword
on
the
thigh
and
shoulder
the
musket
doubtless
this
report
was
a
perversion
of
the
truth
other
meetings
were
held
and
resolutions
were
the
order
of
the
day
on
the
of
june
faneuil
hall
was
again
crowded
james
otis
thomas
cushing
samuel
adams
and
john
hancock
were
selected
as
representatives
to
meet
committees
of
other
towns
in
a
convention
at
this
meeting
it
was
voted
that
the
people
should
arm
themselves
the
convention
met
with
delegates
present
from
nearly
ninety
towns
the
movement
against
the
ministerial
scheme
had
already
become
revolutionary
meanwhile
in
the
general
assembly
was
unceremoniously
prorogued
by
governor
bernard
but
in
may
of
the
following
year
the
body
was
on
the
meeting
day
the
building
was
surrounded
with
british
troops
otis
made
an
address
declaring
that
free
legislation
would
be
impossible
in
the
presence
of
an
armed
soldiery
he
moved
the
appointment
of
a
committee
to
remonstrate
with
the
governor
and
to
request
the
withdrawal
of
the
soldiers
to
this
the
governor
replied
evasively
that
he
had
not
the
authority
to
order
the
withdrawal
of
the
military
otis
in
answer
reported
that
the
governor
reply
was
according
to
english
law
more
impossible
than
the
thing
which
the
assembly
had
petitioned
for
the
matter
resulted
in
the
adjournment
of
the
body
to
meet
at
cambridge
in
the
chapel
of
harvard
college
assembled
at
that
place
the
legislature
was
addressed
by
otis
with
impassioned
eloquence
the
people
as
well
as
the
legislators
were
gathered
the
times
are
dark
and
trying
said
the
speaker
we
may
soon
be
called
on
in
turn
to
act
or
to
suffer
you
he
continued
should
study
and
emulate
the
models
of
ancient
patriotism
to
you
your
country
may
one
day
look
for
support
and
you
should
recollect
that
the
noblest
of
all
duties
is
to
serve
that
country
and
if
necessary
to
devote
your
lives
in
her
cause
the
house
soon
prepared
a
paper
to
be
sent
to
the
british
ministry
denouncing
the
administration
of
governor
bernard
and
protesting
against
the
further
presence
of
a
british
soldiery
in
boston
on
the
of
june
the
representatives
went
further
and
prepared
a
petition
praying
for
the
removal
of
bernard
from
the
government
this
they
might
well
do
for
the
king
had
already
recalled
him
the
governor
went
away
in
such
odor
as
the
breezes
of
the
old
bay
have
hardly
yet
dissipated
he
went
away
but
in
the
fall
added
his
compliments
to
the
americans
by
the
publication
of
sundry
letters
in
which
they
were
traduced
and
vilified
to
this
james
otis
and
samuel
adams
were
appointed
a
committee
to
reply
they
did
so
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
an
appeal
to
the
world
or
a
vindication
of
the
town
of
boston
etc
it
was
in
these
tumultuous
and
honorable
labors
and
excitements
extending
over
a
period
of
fully
ten
years
that
the
intellect
of
james
otis
became
overstrained
and
at
length
warped
from
its
purpose
we
may
regard
his
rational
career
as
ending
with
the
year
in
september
of
this
year
it
was
noticed
that
he
had
become
excitable
and
that
his
natural
eccentricity
was
accented
at
times
to
the
extent
of
rendering
his
conduct
irrational
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
published
in
the
boston
gazette
what
he
called
an
advertisement
in
which
he
placarded
the
four
commissioners
of
customs
on
the
ground
that
they
had
assailed
his
character
declaring
that
they
had
formed
a
confederacy
of
villainy
and
warning
the
officers
of
the
crown
to
pay
no
attention
to
them
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
otis
went
into
a
where
john
robinson
one
of
the
commissioners
whom
he
had
lampooned
was
sitting
on
entering
the
room
otis
was
attacked
by
robinson
who
struck
him
with
his
cane
otis
struck
back
there
was
a
battle
those
who
were
present
were
robinson
friends
the
fight
became
a
melee
a
young
man
named
gridley
undertook
to
assist
otis
but
was
himself
overpowered
and
pitched
out
of
the
house
otis
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
head
and
was
taken
to
his
house
bleeding
and
exhausted
the
principle
wound
appeared
to
be
inflicted
with
a
sword
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cut
and
an
empty
scabbard
was
found
on
the
floor
of
the
room
in
which
the
altercation
occurred
on
the
morrow
boston
was
aflame
with
excitement
otis
was
seriously
injured
in
fact
he
never
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
assault
he
brought
suit
against
robinson
and
a
jury
gave
a
judgment
of
two
thousand
pounds
damages
against
the
defendant
the
latter
arose
in
court
with
a
writing
of
open
confession
and
apology
and
hereupon
the
spirited
and
generous
otis
refused
to
avail
himself
of
the
verdict
could
he
have
thrown
off
the
effects
of
the
injury
in
like
manner
his
last
years
might
have
been
a
happier
sequel
to
a
useful
and
patriotic
life
during
the
sessions
of
the
assembly
in
the
years
and
james
otis
retained
his
membership
but
the
mental
disease
which
afflicted
him
began
to
grow
worse
and
he
participated
only
at
intervals
and
eccentrically
in
the
business
of
legislation
in
may
of
a
town
meeting
was
held
in
boston
and
a
resolution
of
thanks
was
passed
to
the
distinguished
representative
for
his
services
in
the
general
assembly
this
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
retirement
into
the
country
in
the
hope
of
regaining
his
health
at
the
close
the
resolution
declared
the
town
can
not
but
express
their
ardent
wishes
for
the
recovery
of
his
otis
health
and
the
continuance
of
those
public
services
that
must
long
be
remembered
with
gratitude
and
distinguish
his
name
among
the
patriots
of
america
from
this
time
forth
the
usefulness
of
james
otis
was
virtually
at
an
end
in
the
immortal
drama
on
which
the
curtain
was
rising
the
drama
of
liberty
and
independence
he
was
destined
to
take
no
part
the
in
eclipse
must
give
place
to
the
revolutionist
who
was
rising
john
adams
came
after
not
wholly
by
his
own
ambition
but
at
the
call
of
inexorable
history
to
take
the
part
and
place
of
the
great
forerunner
what
must
have
been
the
thoughts
and
emotions
of
that
forerunner
when
the
minute
men
of
massachusetts
came
firing
and
charging
after
the
british
soldiers
in
full
retreat
from
concord
bridge
and
lexington
with
what
convulsion
must
his
mind
in
and
ruin
have
received
the
news
of
the
still
greater
deed
at
bunker
hill
history
is
silent
as
to
what
the
broken
titan
thought
and
said
in
those
heroic
days
the
patriot
in
dim
eclipse
became
at
times
wholly
rational
but
with
the
least
excitement
his
malady
would
return
in
conversation
something
of
his
old
brilliancy
would
return
in
flashes
for
the
rest
the
chimes
in
that
high
soul
no
longer
played
the
music
of
reason
but
gave
out
only
the
discords
of
insanity
he
was
never
reduced
to
serious
delirium
or
to
violent
frenzy
but
he
was
an
insane
man
and
under
this
shadow
he
walked
for
the
greater
part
of
ten
years
during
which
independence
was
declared
and
the
revolution
fought
out
to
a
victorious
end
it
was
in
this
period
of
decline
and
obscuration
that
james
otis
witnessed
through
the
gathering
shadows
the
rise
to
distinction
and
fame
of
many
of
the
patriots
whom
he
had
led
in
the
first
campaigns
for
liberty
john
adams
and
hancock
were
now
at
the
fore
battling
for
independence
among
those
who
rose
to
eminence
in
the
immortal
eighth
decade
was
samuel
alleyne
otis
who
in
was
elected
a
representative
in
the
great
congress
of
the
revolution
james
did
not
live
to
see
his
brother
become
speaker
of
the
house
but
he
witnessed
in
his
service
as
a
member
of
the
constitutional
convention
of
massachusetts
afterward
in
he
was
a
commissioner
to
negotiate
a
settlement
with
the
participants
in
shay
rebellion
with
the
organization
of
the
new
national
government
he
became
secretary
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
served
in
that
capacity
until
his
death
april
in
otis
was
taken
by
his
friend
colonel
samuel
osgood
to
the
home
of
the
latter
in
andover
there
the
enfeebled
patriot
passed
the
remainder
of
his
life
he
became
very
obese
and
his
nervous
excitability
to
an
extent
subsided
he
was
amiable
and
interesting
to
his
friends
his
health
was
in
some
measure
restored
but
his
intellectual
strength
did
not
return
he
thought
of
going
back
to
boston
and
in
one
instance
he
accepted
and
conducted
a
case
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
but
his
manner
was
that
of
a
paretic
giant
the
favorable
turn
in
otis
condition
was
at
length
arrested
by
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
dine
with
governor
hancock
at
the
dinner
he
was
observed
to
become
first
sad
and
then
to
waver
into
mental
occultation
he
was
taken
by
his
brother
hon
samuel
alleyne
otis
to
andover
the
event
convinced
the
sufferer
that
the
end
of
his
life
was
not
distant
strange
strange
are
the
foregleams
of
the
things
to
come
on
one
occasion
he
said
to
his
sister
warren
i
hope
when
god
almighty
in
his
providence
shall
take
me
out
of
time
into
eternity
it
will
be
by
a
flash
of
lightning
the
tradition
goes
that
he
frequently
gave
expression
to
this
wish
did
the
soul
foresee
the
manner
of
its
exit
a
marvelous
and
tragic
end
was
indeed
at
hand
on
the
of
may
only
a
few
months
before
the
briton
left
our
shores
never
to
return
but
by
the
courtesy
of
the
republic
a
thundercloud
such
as
the
season
brings
in
new
england
passed
over
andover
james
otis
stood
against
the
lintel
of
the
door
watching
the
commotion
of
the
elements
there
was
a
crash
of
thunder
the
lightning
darted
from
heaven
to
earth
and
passed
through
the
body
of
the
patriot
instantly
he
was
dead
there
was
no
mark
upon
him
no
contortion
left
its
snarling
twist
on
the
placid
features
of
him
who
had
contributed
so
much
of
genius
and
patriotic
fire
to
the
freedom
and
future
greatness
of
his
country
so
much
to
the
happiness
of
his
countrymen
on
the
of
the
month
the
body
of
otis
was
taken
to
boston
and
was
placed
in
modest
state
in
his
former
home
the
funeral
on
the
was
conducted
by
the
brotherhood
of
free
and
accepted
masons
to
which
otis
belonged
the
sepulture
was
made
as
narrated
in
the
first
pages
of
this
monograph
in
the
cunningham
tomb
in
the
old
granary
burying
ground
in
that
tomb
also
was
laid
six
years
afterwards
the
body
of
ruth

wife
out
of
this
brief
narrative
of
a
great
life
let
each
reader
for
himself
deduce
as
he
may
the
inspiration
and
purpose
without
which
american
citizenship
is
no
better
that
some
other
since
the
first
pages
of
this
monograph
were
written
in
march
the
sons
of
the
american
revolution
have
marked
the
grave
of
james
otis
with
a
bronze
reproduction
of
their
armorial
badge
and
a
small
tablet

should

the

his

between

when

shall

the

will
be
as
clear
as
their
power
is
at
present
of
doing
it
if
they
please
the
character
of
james
otis
by
charles
edmunds
ph
in
viewing
washington
as
the
father
of
our
country
as
he
certainly
was
in
a
sense
which
we
of
are
coming
more
and
more
to
appreciate
in
classing
hamilton
and
jefferson
as
brothers
of
washington
in
his
great
work
and
in
ascribing
to
franklin
even
a
greater
share
in
establishing
the
united
states
of
america
than
to
any
of
these
three
we
are
apt
to
forget
those
patriots
who
did
so
much
to
keep
alive
the
spirit
of
liberty
and
justice
in
our
land
during
the
troublesome
times
preceding
the
actual
rupture
between
england
and
her
american
colonies
while
we
ascribe
great
and
merited
praise
to
those
who
not
only
helped
to
lay
the
foundation
but
also
actually
began
to
build
the
superstructure
of
our
nationhood
let
us
not
forget
those
who
by
reason
of
the
slightly
earlier
day
in
which
they
strove
needed
even
a
clearer
vision
to
follow
the
same
plans
they
labored
before
the
day
had
dawned
and
yet
they
held
ever
before
them
the
same
general
principles
of
liberty
and
justice
which
actuated
the
lives
of
those
who
took
up
their
work
after
them
when
the
light
of
independence
was
fast
breaking
on
our
shores
among
these
there
is
none
more
worthy
of
remembrance
and
admiration
than
james
otis
the
foremost
advocate
of
his
time
in
the
colonies
very
vigorously
he
toiled
in
sowing
seed
the
fruits
of
which
he
himself
was
not
to
see
but
which
under
the
nurture
of
other
able
hands
and
in
the
providence
of
the
god
of
nations
budded
at
last
into
the
great
republic
thus
it
becomes
the
purpose
of
this
article
to
recall
briefly
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
him
whose
name
must
always
be
intimately
associated
with
the
ardent
debates
and
the
troublesome
events
which
foreshadowed
the
great
struggle
between
the
greatest
of
colonizing
nations
and
her
greatest
colonies
the
exigency
of
these
times
was
great
and
men
of
courage
and
capacity
wise
in
council
and
prompt
in
action
rose
to
meet
it
they
were
not
men
ennobled
merely
by
their
appearance
on
the
stage
at
the
time
when
great
scenes
were
passing
they
took
a
part
in
those
scenes
with
a
degree
of
aptness
and
energy
proportional
to
the
magnitude
of
the
occasion
and
throughout
displayed
high
qualities
of
character
otis
part
was
played
not
so
much
in
the
revolution
itself
as
in
the
agitations
and
controversies
by
which
it
was
heralded
and
its
way
prepared
admirably
fitted
by
his
popular
talents
legal
acquirements
and
ardent
temperament
to
take
an
active
share
in
the
discussion
respecting
the
comparative
rights
of
the
colonies
and
the
british
parliament
and
in
preparing
the
minds
of
his
countrymen
for
the
great
step
of
a
final
separation
from
england
and
having
exhausted
as
it
were
his
mental
powers
in
this
preparatory
effort
his
mind
was
darkened
when
the
contest
really
came
and
he
remained
an
impotent
spectator
of
the
struggle
by
which
the
liberties
of
his
native
land
were
at
last
permanently
established
the
life
of
james
otis
as
narrated
by
william
tudor
is
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
instructive
in
the
whole
range
of
american
biographies
and
leaves
few
particulars
in
the
personal
life
of
otis
to
be
gathered
by
the
subsequent
investigator
the
sketch
by
francis
bowen
in
jared
sparks
library
of
american
biography
furnishes
additional
and
valuable
illustrations
of
the
character
and
services
of
otis
which
were
secured
from
the
third
volume
of
thomas
hutchinson
history
of
massachusetts
first
published
after
tudor
life
of
otis
appeared
from
the
copies
of
papers
in
the
office
of
the
english
board
of
trade
relating
to
the
colonial
history
of
massachusetts
and
from
the
private
correspondence
of
governors
bernard
and
hutchinson
with
the
english
ministry
during
the
time
of
otis
public
career
these
sources
throw
much
light
on
the
conduct
of
otis
as
the
chief
political
opponent
of
the
these
two
colonial
executives
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
present
article
merely
to
emphasize
the
three
striking
traits
of
his
character
his
impetuosity
and
earnestness
his
high
integrity
and
devotion
to
truth
and
justice
and
his
marked
ability
as
an
advocate
before
the
bar
in
reading
the
memoirs
of
james
otis
one
is
struck
from
first
to
last
with
the
impetuosity
the
earnestness
the
ardent
temper
of
his
nature
this
was
at
once
the
secret
of
a
great
measure
of
his
power
and
also
the
partial
source
of
his
mental
undoing
as
a
student
at
harvard
the
last
two
years
of
his
college
life
were
marked
with
great
assiduity
in
study
and
while
at
home
during
the
vacations
in
this
period
he
devoted
himself
so
closely
to
his
books
that
he
was
seldom
seen
by
his
friends
and
often
it
was
not
known
that
he
had
returned
till
he
had
been
in
his
father
house
for
some
days
such
severe
application
doubtless
served
to
sow
the
first
seeds
of
mental
derangement
which
falling
on
the
fertile
soil
of
his
feverish
disposition
and
nutured
by
the
constant
and
intense
argumentative
strife
of
his
later
political
career
finally
found
their
fruition
in
the
mental
collapse
which
so
distressingly
darkened
his
latter
days
when
participating
in
the
common
amusements
of
youth
he
exhibited
all
the
vivacity
of
an
excitable
temperament
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
led
him
to
resign
a
lucrative
office
renounce
the
favor
of
government
abandon
the
fairest
prospects
of
professional
emolument
and
distinction
and
to
devote
himself
to
the
service
of
his
country
with
unflinching
courage
quenchless
zeal
and
untiring
energy
as
an
orator
the
impetuosity
of
his
speech
and
the
earnestness
of
his
voice
and
manner
were
so
impressive
that
they
forced
conviction
upon
his
hearers
even
when
his
arguments
did
not
reach
their
judgment
such
was
the
fluency
and
animation
of
his
language
whether
written
or
spoken
that
though
it
was
sometimes
coarse
and
defective
in
taste
it
was
always
as
will
be
seen
from
the
examples
quoted
in
this
paper
extremely
effective
in
political
controversy
the
impetuosity
of
his
nature
led
him
to
be
irascible
and
harsh
towards
his
opponents
and
sometimes
hasty
in
judgment
but
towards
those
whom
he
liked
he
was
equally
effusive
in
expressions
of
regard
and
was
generous
and
placable
the
fiery
and
impetuous
temper
of
otis
is
well
illustrated
by
the
following
anecdote
given
by
tudor
who
however
does
not
vouch
for
its
authenticity
upon
first
taking
his
seat
in
the
house
a
friend
sitting
near
said
otis
you
have
great
abilities
but
are
too
warm
too
impetuous
your
opponents
though
they
can
not
meet
you
in
argument
will
get
the
advantage
by
interrupting
you
and
putting
you
in
a
passion
well
said
otis
if
you
see
me
growing
warm
give
me
a
hint
and
command
myself
later
on
when
a
question
of
some
importance
arose
otis
and
this
friend
were
on
the
boston
seat
together
otis
said
he
was
going
to
speak
and
his
companion
again
warned
him
against
being
irritated
by
interruptions
from
the
opposition
he
soon
rose
and
was
speaking
with
great
fluency
and
powerful
logic
when
timothy
ruggles
interrupted
him
he
grew
warm
in
reply
and
his
friend
pulled
his
coat
slightly
otis
scowled
as
he
turned
round
but
taking
the
hint
moderated
his
tone
soon
afterwards
choate
of
ipswich
broke
in
on
him
again
this
aroused
his
temper
and
his
coat
was
pulled
a
second
time
turning
round
quickly
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
his
monitor
let
me
alone
do
you
take
me
for
a
schoolboy
and
continuing
his
address
with
great
impetuosity
he
overwhelmed
his
opponent
with
sarcasm
and
invective
without
doubt
james
otis
was
a
strong
man
a
man
of
strong
and
positive
character
whose
friends
and
enemies
were
equally
strong
in
their
feelings
of
like
and
dislike
the
men
who
were
ranged
as
his
enemies
have
for
the
most
part
been
relegated
to
a
second
place
on
the
page
of
history
this
does
not
apply
to
thomas
hutchinson
who
in
his
official
capacity
was
otis
chief
political
opponent
but
who
did
not
exhibit
the
personal
enemity
of
bernard
and
others
while
those
who
were
his
friends
stand
out
boldly
among
the
notable
characters
of
the
past
as
otis
himself
remarked
concerning
charles
lee
we
are
not
at
a
loss
to
know
which
is
the
highest
evidence
of
his
virtues
the
greatness
and
number
of
his
friends
or
the
malice
and
envy
of
his
foes
but
friends
and
foes
alike
agree
in
ascribing
to
him
a
very
ardent
temperament
though
with
the
latter
it
is
unjustly
regarded
as
violent
there
is
a
great
contrast
between
the
estimate
of
otis
given
by
hutchinson
quoted
below
and
that
exhibited
in
the
following
extract
from
a
long
letter
written
by
governor
bernard
to
lord
shelburne
near
the
end
of
the
year
which
is
entirely
filled
with
a
review
of
otis
career
and
character
and
is
a
curious
specimen
of
studied
calumniation
the
introductory
remarks
show
sufficiently
well
the
spirit
of
the
whole
i
would
avoid
personalities
but
in
the
present
case
it
is
impossible
the
troubles
in
this
country
take
their
rise
from
and
owe
their
continuance
to
one
man
so
much
that
this
history
alone
would
contain
a
full
account
of
them
this
man
james
otis
was
a
lawyer
at
boston
when
i
first
came
to
the
government
he
is
by
nature
a
passionate
violent
and
desperate
man
which
qualities
sometimes
work
him
up
to
an
absolute
i
say
nothing
of
him
which
is
not
known
to
be
his
certain
character
confirmed
by
frequent
experience
while
sympathy
for
otis
made
the
public
commonly
ascribe
the
alienation
of
his
reason
chiefly
to
the
injuries
received
during
his
encounter
with
robinson
in
the
british
coffee
house
it
is
fairly
certain
that
the
commencement
of
the
disease
dates
further
back
and
that
the
blows
on
the
head
hastened
and
aggravated
an
already
incipient
malady
superinduced
by
very
different
causes
in
the
ardor
and
assiduity
of
his
devotion
to
the
colonial
cause
otis
had
overtaxed
his
mental
powers
his
fine
faculties
that
had
been
exerted
so
strenuously
and
with
such
striking
effect
in
the
service
of
his
country
were
sinking
under
the
excitement
and
the
effort
which
had
sustained
them
in
the
heat
of
action
for
ten
years
he
had
abandoned
the
ordinary
practice
of
his
profession
and
renouncing
all
recreation
had
given
his
entire
time
and
thought
himself
verily
to
the
great
argument
which
involved
the
welfare
of
the
colonies
and
as
we
now
see
it
of
the
world
to
allow
one
idea
exclusive
occupancy
of
the
mind
and
constantly
to
ponder
a
single
topic
is
a
very
frequent
and
almost
sure
cause
of
mental
distress
it
was
his
highest
merit
and
at
the
same
time
his
greatest
misfortune
that
otis
permitted
this
political
controversy
to
have
such
an
absorbing
and
despotic
command
of
his
attention
that
melancholy
consequences
gradually
appeared
and
left
little
hope
of
his
final
restoration
his
excitable
and
passionate
temperament
allowed
the
fire
to
be
soon
kindled
and
nourished
the
flame
in
which
his
intellect
strong
as
it
had
been
was
ultimately
destroyed
otis
mental
malady
first
appeared
in
a
form
which
was
mistaken
for
mere
eccentricity
of
humor
and
some
time
elapsed
before
his
oddities
of
fancy
and
conduct
deepened
into
acknowledged
insanity
an
incident
which
might
have
aroused
the
suspicions
of
his
friends
occurred
during
the
legislative
session
of
when
at
the
close
of
a
powerful
and
ingenious
speech
by
brigadier
ruggles
in
which
he
had
made
a
deep
impression
otis
at
once
arose
and
in
an
impassioned
tone
and
manner
which
struck
awe
upon
all
those
present
exclaimed
speaker
the
liberty
of
this
country
is
gone
forever
and
i
go
after
it
and
turning
round
immediately
left
the
house
some
members
stared
some
laughed
but
none
seemed
to
suspect
the
true
cause
of
this
odd
behavior
how
after
the
encounter
with
robinson
this
mental
disease
made
inroads
on
his
fine
powers
we
best
know
from
john
adams
who
on
september
wrote
otis
talks
all
he
grows
the
most
talkative
man
alive
no
other
gentleman
in
company
can
find
space
to
put
in
a
word
he
grows
narrative
like
an
old
man
on
september
occurred
the
encounter
with
robinson
one
of
the
commissioners
of
customs
at
the
british
coffee
house
which
greatly
aggravated
his
mental
disorder
from
this
time
on
he
was
a
subject
of
some
perplexity
to
the
whig
leaders
though
the
spell
with
which
he
influenced
the
people
was
long
in
breaking
on
january
adams
again
wrote
otis
is
in
confusion
yet
he
loses
himself
he
rambles
and
wanders
like
a
ship
without
a
helm
attempted
to
tell
a
story
which
took
up
almost
all
the
evening
in
one
word
otis
will
spoil
the
club
he
talks
so
much
and
takes
up
so
much
of
our
time
and
fills
it
with
trash
obsceneness
profaneness
nonsense
and
distraction
that
we
have
none
left
for
rational
amusements
or
inquiries
i
fear
i
tremble
i
mourn
for
the
man
and
for
his
country
many
others
mourn
over
him
with
tears
in
their
eyes
in
connection
with
otis
charge
against
hutchinson
as
to
rapacious
the
following
extract
from
john
adams
diary
is
of
curious
interest
after
detailing
certain
detractions
of
which
he
had
been
the
victim
the
diarist
breaks
out
testily
this
is
the
rant
of
otis
concerning
me
but
be
it
known
to
otis
i
have
been
in
the
public
cause
as
long
as
he
though
i
was
never
in
the
general
court
but
one
year
i
have
sacrificed
as
much
to
it
as
he
i
have
never
got
my
father
chosen
speaker
and
counselor
by
it
my
chosen
into
the
house
and
chosen
speaker
by
it
nor
a
into
the
house
and
council
by
it
nor
did
i
ever
turn
about
in
the
house
and
rant
it
on
the
side
of
the
prerogative
for
a
whole
year
to
get
a
father
into
a
probate
office
first
justice
of
a
court
of
common
pleas
and
a
brother
into
a
clerk
office
there
is
a
complication
of
malice
envy
and
jealousy
in
this
man
in
the
present
disordered
state
of
his
mind
which
is
quite
shocking
in
this
incapacity
of
otis
who
at
last
had
to
seek
confinement
samuel
adams
came
to
the
front
of
the
opposition
to
hutchinson
as
representing
the
government
policy
and
in
nothing
did
he
show
more
adroitness
than
in
the
manner
in
which
he
humored
and
exploited
the
colleague
whom
though
sick
the
people
would
not
suffer
to
be
withdrawn
as
is
shown
by
the
following
resolution
resolution
adopted
at
a
town
meeting
in
boston
may
the
honorable
james
otis
having
by
advice
of
his
physician
retired
into
the
country
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
voted
that
thanks
of
the
town
be
given
to
the
honorable
james
otis
for
the
great
and
important
services
which
as
a
representative
in
the
general
assembly
through
a
course
of
years
he
has
rendered
to
this
town
and
province
particularly
for
his
undaunted
exertions
in
the
common
cause
of
the
colonies
from
the
beginning
of
the
present
glorious
struggle
for
the
rights
of
the
british
consituation
at
the
same
time
the
town
can
not
but
express
their
ardent
wishes
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
and
the
continuance
of
those
public
services
that
must
long
be
remembered
with
gratitude
and
distinguish
his
name
among
the
patriots
of
america
during
short
periods
of
sanity
or
of
only
partial
aberration
otis
wit
and
humor
rendered
more
quaint
and
striking
by
the
peculiarities
of
his
mental
condition
made
him
the
delight
of
a
small
circle
of
friends
the
following
anecdote
admirably
told
by
president
adams
presents
in
a
very
graphic
manner
the
peculiarities
of
his
character
otis
belonged
to
a
club
who
met
on
evenings
of
which
club
william
molineux
was
a
member
molineux
had
a
petition
before
the
legislature
which
did
not
succeed
to
his
wishes
and
he
became
for
several
evenings
sour
and
wearied
the
company
with
his
complaints
of
services
losses
sacrifices
and
said
a
man
who
has
behaved
as
i
have
should
be
treated
as
i
am
is
intolerable
etc
otis
had
said
nothing
but
the
company
were
disgusted
and
out
of
patience
when
otis
rose
from
his
seat
and
said
come
will
quit
this
subject
and
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
i
also
have
a
list
of
grievances
will
you
hear
it
the
club
expected
some
fun
and
all
cried
out
ay
let
us
hear
your
list
then
will
in
the
first
place
i
resigned
the
office
of
the
which
i
held
from
the
crown
that
produced
me
how
much
do
you
think
great
deal
no
doubt
said
molineux
we
say
two
hundred
sterling
a
year
more
i
believe
said
molineux
let
it
be
two
hundred
that
for
ten
years
is
two
thousand
in
the
next
place
i
have
been
obliged
to
relinquish
the
greatest
part
of
my
business
at
the
bar
will
you
set
that
at
two
hundred
more
i
believe
it
much
more
than
that
let
it
be
two
hundred
this
for
ten
years
is
two
thousand
you
allow
then
i
have
lost
four
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
much
more
too
said
molineux
the
next
place
i
have
lost
a
hundred
friends
among
whom
were
the
men
of
the
first
rank
fortune
and
power
in
the
province
at
what
price
will
you
estimate
them
n
them
said
molineux
nothing
you
are
better
without
them
than
with
them
a
loud
laugh
it
so
said
otis
the
next
place
i
have
made
a
thousand
enemies
among
whom
are
the
government
of
the
province
and
the
nation
what
do
you
think
of
this
item
is
as
it
may
happen
said
molineux
the
next
place
you
know
i
love
pleasure
but
i
have
renounced
all
amusement
for
ten
years
what
is
that
worth
to
a
man
of
pleasure
great
matter
said
molineux
have
made
politics
your
amusement
a
hearty
laugh
the
next
place
i
have
ruined
as
fine
health
and
as
good
a
constitution
of
body
as
nature
ever
gave
to
man
is
melancholy
indeed
said
molineux
is
nothing
to
be
said
on
that
point
more
said
otis
holding
his
head
down
before
molineux
upon
this
head
where
was
a
scar
in
which
a
man
might
bury
his
finger
do
you
think
of
this
and
what
is
worse
my
friends
think
i
have
a
monstrous
crack
in
my
skull
this
made
all
the
company
very
grave
and
look
very
solemn
but
otis
setting
up
a
laugh
and
with
a
gay
countenance
said
to
molineux
willy
my
advice
to
you
is
to
say
no
more
about
your
grievances
for
you
and
i
had
better
put
up
our
accounts
of
profit
and
loss
in
our
pockets
and
say
no
more
about
them
lest
the
world
should
laugh
at
us
this
whimsical
dialogue
put
all
the
company
including
molineux
in
a
good
humor
and
they
passed
the
rest
of
the
evening
very
pleasantly
one
of
the
few
fragments
in
otis
handwriting
now
extant
is
a
memorandum
made
during
the
two
years
of
transient
sanity
just
preceding
his
tragic
death
returning
one
sunday
from
public
worship
he
wrote
i
have
this
day
attended
divine
service
and
heard
a
sensible
discourse
and
thanks
be
to
god
i
now
enjoy
the
greatest
of
all
blessings
mens
sana
in
copore
sano
a
sound
mind
in
a
sound
body
but
this
gleam
of
reason
was
as
transient
as
others
that
had
preceded
and
with
bowen
we
willingly
draw
a
veil
over
the
sad
record
of
this
most
terrible
misfortune
of
our
hero
to
be
among
men
and
yet
not
of
them
to
preserve
the
outward
form
and
lineaments
of
a
human
being
while
the
spirit
within
is
wanting
or
is
transformed
into
a
wreck
of
what
it
has
been
is
surely
one
of
the
most
impressive
and
affecting
instances
of
the
ills
to
which
mortality
is
exposed
it
enforces
with
melancholy
earnestness
the
moral
lesson
that
the
only
objects
of
the
affections
are
the
character
and
the
intellect
and
when
these
are
destroyed
we
look
upon
the
external
shape
and
features
only
as
on
the
tomb
in
which
the
mortal
remains
of
a
friend
repose
we
even
long
for
the
closing
of
the
scene
and
think
it
would
be
far
better
if
the
now
tenantless
and
ruined
house
were
levelled
with
the
ground
a
nice
sense
of
honor
was
perhaps
the
second
most
striking
point
in
otis
energetic
and
character
called
by
reason
of
his
fame
as
an
advocate
to
the
management
of
suits
even
at
a
distance
from
home
and
receiving
the
largest
fees
ever
given
to
an
advocate
in
the
province
he
yet
disdained
to
suffer
the
success
of
any
of
his
cases
to
rest
on
any
petty
arts
or
undue
evasions
conscious
of
possessing
eminent
abilities
and
sufficient
learning
he
undertook
to
advocate
no
cause
that
he
did
not
truly
and
fully
believe
in
his
ardent
pleading
and
the
fairness
of
his
dealing
before
the
courts
was
the
result
of
his
firm
belief
in
the
justice
of
his
cause
nothing
but
truth
could
give
him
this
firmness
but
plain
truth
and
clear
evidence
can
be
beat
down
by
no
ability
in
handling
the
quirks
and
substitutes
of
the
law
it
was
from
this
source
as
from
no
other
that
otis
drew
his
power
as
a
pleader
he
was
as
john
adams
records
concerning
his
speech
on
the
writs
of
assistance
a
flame
of
fire
but
he
was
a
flame
of
fire
set
burning
to
consume
the
dross
of
injustice
and
to
purify
and
rescue
the
gold
of
liberty
and
thomas
hutchinson
before
whom
otis
often
pleaded
and
whose
testimony
is
of
the
greatest
weight
when
we
remember
that
otis
was
his
political
opponent
has
said
that
he
never
knew
fairer
or
more
noble
conduct
in
a
pleader
than
in
otis
that
he
always
disdained
to
take
advantage
of
any
clerical
error
or
similar
inadvertence
but
passed
over
minor
points
and
defended
his
causes
solely
on
their
broad
and
substantial
foundations
in
this
regard
otis
seems
to
satisfy
emerson
definition
of
a
great
man
when
in
his
essay
on
the
uses
of
great
men
the
latter
declares
i
count
him
a
great
man
who
inhabits
a
higher
sphere
of
thought
into
which
other
men
rise
with
labor
and
difficulty
he
has
but
to
open
his
eyes
to
see
things
in
a
true
light
and
in
large
relations
whilst
they
must
make
painful
corrections
and
keep
a
vigilant
eye
on
many
sources
of
error
indeed
it
can
be
said
of
otis
as
coleridge
said
of
see
how
triumphant
in
debate
and
action
he
is
and
why
because
he
asserts
a
broad
principle
acts
up
to
it
rests
his
body
upon
it
and
has
faith
in
it
the
world
is
upheld
as
emerson
says
by
the
veracity
of
good
men
and
so
the
great
power
of
otis
as
an
advocate
before
the
civil
bar
in
the
minor
cases
of
his
career
and
as
an
advocate
of
the
people
in
the
larger
court
in
the
great
case
of
his
life
for
the
liberty
of
opposing
arbitrary
power
by
speaking
and
writing
the
truth
arose
almost
entirely
from
his
absolute
integrity
and
fairmindedness
clarendon
portrait
of
falkland
applies
equally
as
well
to
otis
he
was
so
severe
an
adorer
of
the
truth
that
he
could
as
easily
have
given
himself
leave
to
steal
as
to
dissemble
in
short
otis
acted
aright
and
feared
not
the
consequences
and
thus
became
a
power
in
the
community
because
of
his
personal
character
the
great
popularity
that
he
immediately
acquired
he
used
for
no
sinister
or
selfish
ends
he
stooped
to
none
of
the
arts
of
the
demagogue
he
was
never
carried
away
by
a
blind
spirit
of
faction
he
opposed
the
arbitrary
design
of
the
english
ministry
with
great
spirit
and
firmness
though
with
some
indiscretion
but
he
was
no
advocate
of
turbulent
dissensions
or
causeless
revolt
he
allowed
himself
to
be
ruled
by
the
greater
moderation
and
prudence
of
his
associates
while
he
inspired
them
with
his
own
resistless
energy
and
determination
no
imputation
can
justly
be
thrown
on
the
sincerity
of
his
patriotism
although
the
attempt
was
made
by
some
of
his
contemporaries
when
in
otis
as
chairman
of
a
committee
of
the
assembly
appointed
to
consider
the
status
of
the
sugar
act
favored
the
commission
of
hutchinson
as
a
special
agent
of
the
colony
to
go
to
england
and
present
the
claims
of
the
colonists
he
was
accused
of
inconsistency
in
opinion
and
action
and
of
dereliction
of
duty
as
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the
patriotic
party
combined
with
the
extraordinary
appointment
of
hutchinson
which
however
never
took
effect
owing
to
the
opposition
of
governor
bernard
otis
was
also
charged
with
a
too
absolute
recognition
of
the
supremacy
of
parliament
in
his
pamphlet
on
the
rights
of
the
colonies
as
his
father
had
recently
received
a
judicial
appointment
of
no
great
importance
however
some
persons
went
so
far
as
to
suspect
otis
fidelity
to
the
cause
among
whom
was
john
adams
as
we
see
from
his
diary
quoted
elsewhere
in
this
paper
people
talked
of
a
compromise
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
for
gradually
withdrawing
all
resistance
to
the
proceedings
of
the
ministry
such
charges
however
were
but
the
indications
of
the
unsteadiness
and
injustice
of
fickle
popular
favor
the
sacrifices
which
otis
made
for
the
cause
as
told
of
by
himself
in
the
narrative
given
in
this
paper
were
far
too
heavy
for
his
patriotism
to
be
doubted
for
an
instant
and
any
remaining
doubt
must
certainly
be
removed
by
a
glance
at
the
official
correspondence
of
governor
bernard
in
which
he
is
from
first
to
last
regarded
as
the
chief
opponent
of
the
prerogative
and
is
subjected
to
much
calumny
on
that
account
the
selection
of
hutchinson
as
the
special
agent
of
the
colony
though
appearing
at
first
sight
somewhat
strange
is
easily
explained
and
appears
as
the
best
possible
choice
he
was
a
native
of
the
province
and
as
such
thoroughly
acquainted
with
its
interests
and
desirous
of
promoting
them
a
few
years
before
he
had
given
sound
advice
to
both
houses
in
relation
to
the
very
matter
of
the
sugar
act
counselling
them
not
to
apply
for
a
reduction
of
the
duty
lest
they
should
appear
as
indirectly
consenting
to
pay
it
under
any
circumstances
advice
which
had
prevailed
against
the
preconceived
opinion
of
a
majority
of
both
branches
of
the
legislature
moreover
hutchinson
attachment
to
the
interests
of
the
crown
and
his
intimate
relations
with
the
ministry
would
enable
him
to
prosecute
the
suit
of
the
province
to
great
advantage
whereas
a
known
leader
of
the
popular
party
in
massachusetts
would
not
be
received
with
much
favor
at
the
board
of
trade
whatever
his
errand
as
to
otis
rather
unstinted
recognition
of
the
prerogatives
of
the
crown
and
the
right
of
parliament
to
tax
the
colonies
we
remark
that
he
had
undoubtedly
the
same
ends
in
view
as
the
other
popular
leaders
but
he
differed
from
them
in
the
choice
of
the
means
the
selection
of
arguments
and
the
proper
mode
of
conducting
the
controversy
all
certainly
desired
to
be
exempt
from
taxation
and
to
secure
freedom
of
trade
the
question
was
how
best
attain
these
ends
and
reconcile
their
pretensions
with
the
acknowledged
principles
of
english
law
otis
opposed
both
the
sugar
act
and
the
stamp
act
on
the
same
broad
principle
on
which
hampden
in
england
resisted
the
payment
of
namely
that
neither
measure
was
sanctioned
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
on
whom
these
contributions
for
the
support
of
the
government
were
to
be
levied
he
was
too
good
a
lawyer
to
question
openly
the
abstract
supremacy
of
parliament
or
to
deny
the
technical
right
of
this
body
to
tax
america
or
to
do
anything
else
but
he
affirmed
that
he
could
not
justifiably
exercise
this
right
unless
representatives
elected
by
america
were
admitted
to
sit
in
the
house
of
commons
when
parliament
said
he
shall
think
fit
to
allow
the
colonists
a
representation
in
the
house
of
commons
the
equity
of
their
taxing
the
colonists
will
be
as
clear
as
their
power
is
at
present
of
doing
it
if
they
please
these
opinions
did
not
coincide
with
the
sentiments
of
the
greater
part
of
the
people
at
this
period
and
they
were
displeased
with
the
explicit
and
comprehensive
terms
in
which
otis
acknowledged
the
authority
of
parliament
they
did
not
care
to
be
reminded
of
their
subjection
in
such
positive
language
otis
incautious
use
of
words
may
have
led
him
to
exaggerate
the
sovereignty
of
england
over
her
colonies
but
the
course
which
he
pursued
was
undoubtedly
the
most
judicious
one
for
the
interests
of
america
that
this
criticism
and
disaffection
concerning
otis
was
of
short
duration
and
justly
so
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
at
the
end
of
the
legislative
session
he
was
appointed
chairman
of
the
committee
charged
with
securing
the
of
the
other
colonies
in
a
united
effort
of
opposition
to
the
scheme
for
taxing
america
that
he
was
sufficiently
alive
to
the
true
interests
of
the
colonies
and
watchful
of
any
imposition
upon
their
rights
as
subjects
under
the
english
constitution
we
may
cite
one
or
two
brief
extracts
from
the
letter
of
instructions
to
the
provincial
agent
in
england
written
by
him
and
adopted
by
the
representatives
the
silence
of
the
province
he
says
in
regard
to
the
sugar
act
should
have
been
imputed
to
any
cause
even
to
despair
rather
than
be
construed
into
tacit
cession
of
their
rights
or
an
acknowledgment
of
a
right
in
the
parliament
of
great
britain
to
impose
duties
and
taxes
upon
a
people
who
are
not
represented
in
the
house
of
commons
ireland
is
a
conquered
country
which
is
not
the
case
with
the
northern
colonies
except
canada
yet
no
duties
have
been
levied
by
the
british
parliament
on
ireland
no
internal
or
external
taxes
have
been
assessed
on
them
but
by
their
own
parliament
granting
that
the
time
may
come
which
we
hope
is
far
off
when
the
british
parliament
shall
think
fit
to
oblige
the
north
americans
not
only
to
maintain
civil
government
among
themselves
for
this
they
have
already
done
but
to
support
an
army
to
protect
them
can
it
be
possible
that
the
duties
to
be
imposed
and
the
taxes
to
be
levied
shall
be
assessed
without
the
voice
or
consent
of
one
american
in
parliament
if
we
are
not
represented
we
are
slaves
the
charge
that
otis
turned
from
his
support
of
the
government
policy
because
his
father
failed
to
receive
the
desired
appointment
as
chief
justice
is
as
unfounded
as
it
is
improbable
the
office
of
chief
justice
was
worth
not
over
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
sterling
a
year
and
as
colonel
otis
practice
at
the
bar
was
worth
much
more
than
this
and
his
seat
in
the
legislature
gave
him
all
the
power
and
reputation
he
needed
the
loss
of
the
chief
justiceship
could
not
have
been
a
very
great
concern
to
him
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
first
measures
of
otis
in
coming
into
public
life
was
to
resign
his
office
as
which
was
worth
twice
as
much
as
the
seat
on
the
bench
of
course
a
person
of
his
fiery
disposition
felt
keenly
the
insult
involved
in
the
rejection
of
his
father
and
doubtless
the
event
imbittered
his
language
towards
hutchinson
but
it
would
hardly
be
likely
to
shape
his
whole
political
career
when
public
questions
of
such
great
moment
were
at
stake
there
was
no
trace
of
meanness
or
selfishness
in
his
disposition
to
be
sure
otis
admitted
superiority
over
his
legal
associates
and
the
natural
impetuosity
of
his
nature
sometimes
made
him
excessively
dogmatic
and
his
manner
though
courteous
even
to
a
fineness
towards
those
whom
he
liked
was
imperious
and
even
unguarded
toward
his
political
enemies
at
one
time
having
cited
dormat
the
noted
french
jurist
author
of
the
civil
laws
in
their
natural
order
in
the
course
of
an
argument
governor
bernard
inquired
who
dormat
was
otis
answered
that
he
was
a
very
distinguished
civilian
and
not
the
less
an
authority
for
being
unknown
to
your
excellency
yet
notice
the
courtesy
exhibited
in
the
following
incident
when
charles
lee
was
in
command
of
the
left
wing
of
the
army
with
his
headquarters
at
winter
hill
in
what
is
now
somerville
he
refused
to
have
an
interview
and
conference
with
his
old
friend
burgoyne
then
lately
arrived
in
boston
looking
toward
the
restoration
of
an
amicable
understanding
between
the
colonies
and
the
mother
country
four
months
later
a
letter
came
from
the
old
world
containing
a
warning
that
lee
was
not
a
man
of
trustworthy
character
otis
was
at
that
time
the
executive
head
of
the
provisional
government
which
had
been
formed
in
massachusetts
during
one
of
the
last
of
his
lucid
intervals
on
behalf
of
the
government
he
sent
a
letter
to
lee
quite
touching
for
its
fairminded
simplicity
the
council
had
come
into
possesssion
of
a
letter
from
ireland
making
very
unfavorable
mention
of
lee
it
produced
no
impression
upon
the
council
on
the
contrary
says
otis
we
are
at
a
loss
to
know
which
is
the
highest
evidence
of
your
virtues
the
greatness
and
number
of
your
friends
or
the
malice
and
envy
of
your
foes
this
was
a
most
delicate
and
effective
way
of
offering
good
advice
when
he
had
suffered
so
cruelly
at
the
hands
of
commissioner
robinson
and
his
companions
at
the
british
coffee
house
and
had
been
awarded
damages
by
the
court
otis
high
spirit
revolted
at
the
idea
of
receiving
pecuniary
compensation
for
a
personal
insult
and
robinson
release
drawn
up
by
otis
himself
is
to
be
found
in
the
files
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
along
with
robinson
written
acknowledgment
and
apology
next
to
his
impetuous
devotion
to
the
true
relations
of
things
the
source
of
otis
power
lay
in
his
adequate
preparation
for
the
life
of
an
advocate
bred
to
the
law
at
a
time
long
before
the
pathway
had
been
smoothed
by
the
multiplication
of
elementary
works
and
other
modern
improvements
he
yet
fully
mastered
that
abstruse
science
which
perhaps
does
more
to
quicken
and
invigorate
the
understanding
than
many
of
the
other
kinds
of
learning
put
together
as
a
sufficient
foundation
for
his
later
legal
studies
he
had
pursued
at
harvard
the
foremost
college
in
the
colonies
not
only
the
regular
undergraduate
classical
course
but
also
the
three
years
of
work
required
for
the
master
degree
moreover
in
conformity
with
his
views
on
the
necessity
of
a
generous
and
comprehensive
culture
of
the
mind
as
a
means
of
success
at
the
bar
or
in
any
professional
career
otis
did
not
plunge
at
once
from
his
collegiate
courses
into
the
routine
of
the
legal
office
but
allowed
himself
two
years
of
general
study
with
a
view
toward
further
disciplining
his
mind
and
widening
his
information
the
subjects
thus
pursued
and
the
general
culture
which
he
acquired
served
to
open
and
to
liberalize
his
mind
in
nearly
the
same
proportion
as
the
assiduous
study
of
the
law
was
next
to
invigorate
and
quicken
it
in
conversation
with
his
brother
he
remarked
that
blackstone
commentaries
would
have
saved
him
seven
years
labor
pouring
over
and
delving
in
black
letter
he
appears
to
have
formed
a
very
correct
judgment
respecting
the
nature
of
professional
education
and
the
best
means
of
mastering
its
abstruse
details
he
constantly
inculcated
upon
the
young
men
who
came
to
study
in
his
office
the
maxim
that
a
lawyer
ought
never
to
be
without
a
volume
of
natural
or
public
law
or
moral
philosophy
on
his
table
or
in
his
pocket
after
two
years
of
practice
in
plymouth
he
removed
to
boston
where
he
found
the
larger
field
which
was
demanded
by
his
superior
training
and
abilities
and
he
very
soon
rose
to
the
front
rank
of
his
profession
the
regard
which
he
entertained
for
his
master
in
the
law
is
well
shown
by
his
conduct
as
the
opposing
advocate
during
the
hearing
on
the
writs
of
assistance
when
otis
having
resigned
his
post
of
of
the
province
in
order
to
champion
the
people
cause
the
vacancy
was
filled
by
the
appointment
of
gridley
otis
held
the
character
and
abilities
of
his
former
teacher
in
very
high
respect
and
allowed
this
differential
feeling
to
appear
throughout
the
trial
it
was
says
john
adams
who
was
present
on
this
occasion
and
from
whom
nearly
all
the
details
of
the
course
of
this
affair
are
derived
it
was
a
moral
spectacle
more
affecting
to
me
than
any
i
have
ever
seen
upon
the
stage
to
observe
a
pupil
treating
his
master
with
all
the
deference
respect
esteem
and
affection
of
a
son
to
a
father
and
that
without
the
least
affectation
while
he
baffled
and
confounded
all
his
authorities
confuted
all
his
arguments
and
reduced
him
to
silence
nor
was
a
suitable
return
wanting
on
the
part
of
gridley
who
seemed
to
me
to
exult
inwardly
at
the
glory
and
triumph
of
his
pupil
though
he
made
no
pretensions
to
scholarship
some
of
his
writings
showed
a
cultivated
taste
and
a
love
of
literary
pursuits
which
were
gratified
so
far
as
his
numerous
engagements
in
public
service
would
permit
with
a
literary
taste
formed
and
matured
by
the
study
of
latin
and
greek
prosidy
as
constituted
in
the
best
models
of
antiquity
it
is
not
surprising
that
his
opinions
on
matters
of
criticism
and
scholarship
were
those
of
the
odd
school
and
that
he
decried
all
the
forms
of
innovation
in
letters
which
had
begun
to
show
themselves
in
his
day
and
which
he
regarded
as
affectations
his
constant
advice
to
young
people
was
if
you
want
to
read
poetry
read
shakespeare
milton
dryden
and
pope
throw
all
the
rest
in
the
fire
and
with
the
addition
of
but
one
or
two
names
which
have
appeared
since
his
time
such
counsel
is
judicious
advice
even
his
abilities
were
perhaps
somewhat
overrated
in
the
admiring
judgment
of
his
contemporaries
his
style
as
a
writer
was
copious
and
energetic
but
it
was
sometimes
careless
coarse
and
even
incorrect
his
eloquence
was
better
adapted
to
popular
assemblies
than
to
the
graver
occasions
of
legislative
debate
in
the
halls
of
justice
it
produced
a
greater
effect
on
the
jury
than
on
the
judge
the
few
fragments
of
his
speeches
that
were
reported
and
are
now
extant
give
no
idea
of
the
enthusiasm
that
was
created
by
their
delivery
the
elevation
of
his
mind
and
the
known
integrity
of
his
purposes
enabled
him
to
speak
with
decision
and
dignity
and
commanded
the
respect
as
well
as
the
admiration
of
his
audience
while
his
arguments
were
sometimes
comprehensive
and
varied
they
generally
related
only
to
a
few
points
which
they
placed
in
a
very
clear
and
convincing
light
his
object
was
immediate
effect
he
had
studied
the
art
of
clear
expression
and
forcible
argument
in
order
to
act
with
facility
and
force
upon
the
minds
of
others
to
such
an
extent
as
to
convince
them
and
then
to
convert
their
conviction
into
action
he
employed
the
facility
and
the
power
thus
gained
not
for
any
personal
agrandizement
but
to
advocate
political
reform
for
the
good
of
the
whole
people
in
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
on
the
writs
of
assistance
he
discussed
the
incompatibility
of
the
acts
of
trade
as
lately
adopted
by
the
english
ministry
with
the
charter
of
the
colony
in
so
doing
he
reproached
the
nation
parliament
and
king
says
john
adams
with
injustice
illiberality
ingratitude
and
oppression
in
their
conduct
towards
the
people
of
this
country
in
a
style
of
oratory
that
i
never
heard
equalled
in
this
or
any
other
country
as
to
the
effect
of
this
oration
in
increasing
the
courage
of
the
colonists
inciting
them
to
scrutinize
more
closely
and
resist
more
strenuously
the
claims
of
the
british
ministry
and
parliament
we
have
adams
significant
statement
i
do
say
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
otis
oration
against
writs
of
assistance
breathed
into
this
nation
the
breath
of
life
the
longest
and
most
elaborate
production
from
his
pen
is
the
pamphlet
on
the
rights
of
the
colonies
it
affords
a
fair
specimen
of
his
impetuous
and
inaccurate
rhetoric
his
rapid
and
eager
manner
of
accumulating
facts
arguments
and
daring
assertions
and
the
glowing
earnestness
and
depth
of
patriotic
feeling
with
which
all
his
compositions
are
animated
it
is
not
surprising
that
a
book
written
in
this
style
caused
the
author
to
be
suspected
of
wildness
and
even
of
madness
but
there
was
as
bowen
remarks
a
method
and
a
good
deal
of
logical
power
in
his
madness
the
pamphlet
was
reprinted
circulated
and
read
in
great
britain
and
even
attracted
the
attention
of
the
house
of
lords
in
february
during
a
debate
in
that
body
on
the
disturbances
in
america
lord
littleton
made
some
allusion
to
the
peculiar
opinions
of
otis
and
spoke
slightingly
of
his
book
lord
mansfield
replied
with
respect
to
what
has
been
said
or
written
upon
this
subject
i
differ
from
the
noble
lord
who
spoke
of
otis
and
his
book
with
contempt
though
he
maintained
the
same
doctrine
in
some
points
although
in
others
he
carried
it
further
than
otis
himself
who
allows
everywhere
the
supremacy
of
the
crown
over
the
colonies
no
man
on
such
a
subject
is
contemptible
otis
is
a
man
of
consequence
among
the
people
there
they
have
chosen
him
for
one
of
their
deputies
at
the
congress
and
general
meeting
from
the
respective
governments
it
was
said
the
man
is
mad
what
then
one
madman
often
makes
many
massaniello
was
mad
no
body
doubts
yet
for
all
that
he
overturned
the
government
of
naples
madness
is
catching
in
all
popular
assemblies
and
upon
all
popular
matters
the
book
is
full
of
wildness
i
never
read
it
till
a
few
days
ago
for
i
seldom
look
into
such
things
in
some
of
his
arguments
he
lays
down
general
principles
with
a
quaint
extravagance
which
marks
the
peculiar
humor
of
the
man
no
government
has
the
right
to
make
asses
and
slaves
of
the
subject
nature
having
made
sufficient
of
the
two
former
for
all
the
lawful
purposes
of
man
from
the
harmless
peasant
in
the
field
to
the
most
refined
politician
in
the
cabinet
but
none
of
the
last
which
infallibly
proves
that
they
are
unnecessary
the
british
constitution
of
government
as
now
established
in
his
majesty
person
and
family
is
the
wisest
and
best
in
the
world
the
king
of
great
britain
is
the
best
as
well
as
the
most
glorious
monarch
upon
the
globe
and
his
subjects
the
happiest
in
the
universe
the
french
king
is
a
despotic
arbitrary
prince
and
consequently
his
subjects
are
very
miserable
the
last
specimen
which
we
shall
quote
comes
from
his
defence
of
the
objectionable
passage
in
the
remonstrance
drawn
up
by
otis
on
behalf
of
the
assembly
of
against
governor
bernard
conduct
in
increasing
the
expenses
of
the
colony
without
previously
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
legislature
this
passage
was
as
follows
no
necessity
can
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
house
of
representatives
in
giving
up
such
a
privilege
for
it
would
be
of
little
consequence
to
the
people
whether
they
were
subject
to
george
or
louis
the
king
of
great
britain
or
the
french
king
if
both
were
arbitrary
as
both
would
be
if
both
could
levy
taxes
without
parliament
afterwards
in
commenting
on
this
passage
he
made
the
following
defense
of
its
apparent
unpatriotic
sentiment
it
may
be
objected
that
there
are
some
differences
between
arbitrary
princes
in
this
respect
at
least
that
some
are
more
rigorous
than
others
it
is
granted
but
then
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
life
of
man
is
a
vapor
that
soon
vanisheth
away
and
we
know
not
who
may
come
after
him
a
wise
man
or
a
fool
though
the
chances
before
and
since
solomon
have
ever
been
in
favor
of
the
latter
that
i
should
die
very
soon
after
my
head
should
be
struck
off
whether
by
a
sabre
or
a
broadsword
whether
chopped
off
to
gratify
a
tyrant
by
the
christian
name
of
tom
dick
or
harry
is
evident
that
the
name
of
the
tyrant
would
be
of
no
more
avail
to
save
my
life
than
the
name
of
the
executioner
needs
no
proof
it
is
therefore
manifestly
of
no
importance
what
a
prince
christian
name
is
if
he
be
arbitrary
any
more
indeed
than
if
he
were
not
arbitrary
so
the
whole
amount
of
this
dangerous
proposition
may
at
least
in
one
view
be
reduced
to
this
viz
it
is
of
little
importance
what
a
christian
name
is
it
is
indeed
of
importance
that
a
king
a
governor
and
all
good
christians
should
have
a
christian
name
but
whether
edward
francis
or
william
is
of
none
that
i
can
discern
a
passage
ascribed
to
otis
during
a
session
of
the
legislature
at
cambridge
gives
some
idea
of
the
character
of
his
invective
it
had
been
said
in
defence
of
some
measure
that
it
had
been
taken
by
the
advice
of
council
when
otis
exclaimed
ay
by
the
advice
of
council
forsooth
and
so
it
goes
and
so
we
are
to
be
ruined
the
council
are
governed
by
his
excellency
his
excellency
by
lord
hillsborough
lord
hillsborough
by
his
majesty
his
majesty
by
lord
bute
and
lord
bute
by
the
lord
knows
who
this
recalls
to
mind
what
used
to
be
said
when
i
was
a
student
in
this
place
it
was
observed
at
that
time
that
the
president
directed
the
scholars
how
they
should
act
madame
directed
the
president
titus
their
black
servant
governed
madame
and
the
devil
prompted
titus
the
most
comprehensive
and
just
appreciation
of
the
character
and
work
of
otis
is
given
us
by
francis
bowen
in
jared
library
of
american
biography
in
part
he
says
the
services
which
otis
rendered
to
this
country
were
so
conspicuous
and
important
that
it
is
difficult
to
form
an
estimate
of
his
character
with
the
impartiality
that
history
requires
gratitude
might
justly
efface
the
memory
of
his
faults
from
the
minds
of
those
who
have
profited
so
largely
by
his
patriotism
and
his
virtues
but
it
is
not
necessary
thus
to
seek
excuses
for
his
failings
or
reasons
for
covering
up
the
errors
that
he
committed
the
defects
of
his
temperament
and
conduct
may
be
freely
mentioned
for
they
are
not
such
as
materially
lessen
our
respect
for
him
as
a
man
as
the
vindicator
of
american
rights
during
the
period
of
colonial
subordination
as
the
acknowledged
leader
in
massachusetts
of
the
constitutional
opposition
to
ministerial
influence
and
parliamentary
usurpation
the
services
of
otis
can
not
be
too
highly
appreciated
he
was
not
permitted
to
witness
the
grand
result
of
his
labors
he
did
not
live
to
enjoy
the
final
triumph
he
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
survived
till
the
opening
of
the
struggle
but
the
historian
who
searches
into
the
causes
of
this
great
event
and
seeks
to
determine
the
comparative
merits
of
the
men
who
achieved
it
will
dwell
long
upon
the
services
and
pay
a
just
tribute
of
admiration
and
respect
to
the
memory
of
james
otis
the
use
and
abuse
of
arbitrary
power
including
tracts
from
burke
and
wilkes
by
charles
edmunds
it
is
the
honor
of
england
that
she
had
deposited
in
the
virgin
soil
of
her
colonies
the
germ
of
freedom
nearly
all
at
their
foundation
or
shortly
after
received
charters
which
conferred
the
franchises
of
the
mother
country
on
the
colonists
these
charters
were
neither
a
vain
show
nor
a
dead
letter
but
really
did
establish
and
allow
powerful
institutions
which
impelled
the
colonists
to
defend
their
liberty
and
to
control
the
power
by
participating
in
it
as
constituted
in
the
grant
of
supplies
the
election
of
public
councils
trial
by
jury
and
the
right
of
assembling
to
discuss
the
general
affairs
to
us
of
these
appear
as
or
logically
necessary
rights
but
we
must
remember
that
in
those
early
days
of
colonization
they
were
distinct
privileges
accorded
in
power
to
the
colonists
and
it
is
in
these
very
privileges
that
we
behold
the
germinating
principle
which
was
ultimately
to
bring
to
life
the
new
republic
then
as
yet
unborn
for
as
thomas
jefferson
afterward
wrote
where
every
man
is
a
sharer
in
the
direction
of
his
and
feels
that
he
is
a
participator
in
the
government
of
affairs
not
merely
at
an
election
one
day
in
the
year
but
every
day
when
there
shall
not
be
a
man
in
the
state
who
will
not
be
a
member
of
some
one
of
its
councils
great
or
small
he
will
let
the
heart
be
torn
out
of
his
body
sooner
than
allow
his
power
to
be
wrested
from
him
by
a
caesar
or
a
bonaparte
how
powerfully
did
we
feel
the
energy
of
this
organization
in
the
case
of
the
embargo
notwithstanding
the
widely
different
origin
of
the
various
colonists
the
circumstances
in
which
they
were
placed
were
so
similar
that
the
same
general
form
of
personal
character
must
inevitably
have
developed
itself
and
produced
a
growing
consciousness
of
power
and
impatience
of
foreign
imposition
the
proximate
independence
of
america
need
not
have
been
a
certainty
however
had
the
eyes
of
english
statesmen
not
been
blinded
to
the
truth
of
the
principles
urged
by
such
men
as
otis
in
america
and
burke
in
england
the
causes
which
were
to
produce
a
final
rupture
were
to
be
sure
already
at
work
their
full
operation
being
delayed
by
the
lack
of
union
among
the
different
provinces
but
there
was
at
the
same
time
a
warm
hereditary
attachment
to
the
parent
country
under
whose
wings
the
provinces
had
grown
up
by
whose
arms
they
had
been
shielded
and
by
whose
commerce
in
spite
of
jealous
restrictions
they
had
been
enriched
indeed
life
in
the
colonies
was
so
closely
related
to
that
in
the
mother
country
that
in
a
very
marked
degree
the
history
of
the
colonies
is
only
the
more
practical
and
laborious
development
of
the
spirit
of
liberty
flourishing
amid
the
conditions
of
life
in
the
new
country
under
the
standard
of
the
laws
and
traditions
of
the
old
country
as
the
eminent
philosophical
historian
guizat
has
said
it
might
be
considered
the
history
of
england
herself
the
resemblance
is
the
more
striking
when
we
remember
that
the
majority
of
the
american
colonies
and
the
more
important
of
them
were
founded
or
increased
the
most
rapidly
at
the
very
epoch
when
england
was
preparing
to
sustain
and
in
part
already
sustaining
those
fierce
conflicts
against
the
pretensions
of
absolute
power
which
were
to
obtain
for
her
the
honor
of
giving
to
the
world
the
first
example
of
a
great
nation
free
and
well
governed
how
similarly
the
state
of
affairs
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
were
not
blinded
by
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
is
shown
by
the
following
extracts
from
burke
and
otis
in
burke
thus
described
the
social
and
political
conditions
both
at
home
and
in
the
colonies
that
the
government
is
at
once
dreaded
and
contemned
that
the
laws
are
despoiled
of
all
their
respected
and
salutary
terrors
that
their
inaction
is
a
subject
of
ridicule
and
their
enforcement
of
abhorrence
that
rank
and
office
and
title
and
all
the
solemn
plausibilities
of
the
world
have
lost
their
reverence
and
effect
that
our
foreign
politics
are
as
much
deranged
as
our
domestic
economy
that
our
dependencies
are
slackened
in
their
affection
and
loosened
from
their
obedience
that
we
know
neither
how
to
yield
nor
how
to
enforce
that
hardly
anything
above
or
below
abroad
or
at
home
is
sound
and
entire
but
that
disconnection
and
confusion
in
office
in
parties
in
families
in
parliament
in
the
nation
prevail
beyond
the
disorders
of
any
former
time
these
are
facts
universally
admitted
and
lamented
when
in
troops
were
sent
to
boston
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
disturbances
which
had
resulted
from
the
arbitrary
and
insulting
manner
in
which
the
commissioners
of
customs
exercised
their
office
otis
was
chosen
moderator
of
the
town
meeting
held
in
protest
and
is
reported
to
have
declared
that
in
case
great
britain
was
not
disposed
to
redress
their
grievances
after
proper
applications
the
inhabitants
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
gird
the
sword
to
the
thigh
and
shoulder
the
musket
another
account
presents
a
somewhat
more
temperate
tone
representing
otis
as
strongly
recommending
peace
and
good
order
and
the
grievances
the
people
labored
under
might
in
time
be
removed
if
not
and
we
were
called
on
to
defend
our
liberties
and
privileges
he
hoped
and
believed
we
should
one
and
all
resist
even
unto
blood
but
at
the
same
time
he
prayed
almighty
god
it
might
never
so
happen
the
change
from
favorable
conditions
both
in
england
and
in
the
colonies
to
the
state
of
unrest
depicted
by
these
passages
from
burke
and
otis
had
been
brought
about
by
the
attempt
to
use
strong
measures
enforced
with
no
just
regard
for
the
welfare
of
the
whole
people
the
english
ministry
failed
to
realize
that
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
not
to
make
mistakes
in
the
use
of
strong
measures
that
firmness
is
a
virtue
only
when
it
accompanies
the
most
perfect
wisdom
their
course
of
political
conduct
combined
with
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
favoritism
both
at
home
and
abroad
like
that
adopted
by
henry
the
third
of
france
produced
results
of
the
same
kind
as
the
latter
members
of
parliament
for
the
most
part
were
practically
convinced
that
they
did
not
depend
on
the
affection
or
opinion
of
the
people
for
their
political
being
and
gave
themselves
over
with
scarcely
the
appearance
of
reserve
to
the
influence
of
the
court
there
was
thus
developed
both
a
ministry
and
parliament
unconnected
with
the
people
and
we
have
the
deplorable
picture
of
the
executive
and
legislative
parts
of
a
government
attempting
to
exist
apart
from
their
true
foundation
the
opinion
of
the
people
how
signally
such
attempts
have
always
failed
is
a
matter
of
historical
record
and
the
steadfast
belief
that
they
always
will
so
fail
constitutes
the
great
force
of
public
opinion
had
the
english
ministry
and
the
colonial
governors
in
particular
governor
bernard
of
massachusetts
recognized
certain
cardinal
principles
of
individual
and
national
liberty
which
were
so
strongly
advocated
by
burke
and
otis
the
course
of
events
in
their
dealing
with
the
colonists
would
in
all
probability
have
been
greatly
different
from
that
actually
developed
burke
declared
that
as
long
as
reputation
the
most
precious
possession
of
every
individual
and
as
long
as
opinion
the
great
support
of
the
state
depend
entirely
upon
the
voice
of
the
people
the
latter
can
never
be
considered
as
a
thing
of
little
consequence
either
to
individuals
or
to
governments
he
pointed
out
that
nations
are
governed
by
the
same
methods
and
on
the
same
principles
by
which
an
individual
without
authority
is
often
able
to
govern
those
who
are
his
equals
or
even
his
superiors
namely
by
a
knowledge
of
their
temper
and
by
a
judicious
management
of
it
that
is
when
public
affairs
are
steadily
and
quietly
conducted
not
when
government
descends
to
a
continued
scuffle
between
the
magistrate
and
the
multitude
in
which
sometimes
the
one
and
sometimes
the
other
is
uppermost
each
alternately
yielding
and
prevailing
in
a
series
of
contemptible
victories
and
scandalous
submissions
the
temper
of
the
people
amongst
whom
he
presides
ought
therefore
to
be
the
first
study
of
a
statesman
and
the
knowledge
of
this
temper
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
for
him
to
attain
if
he
has
not
an
interest
in
being
ignorant
of
what
it
is
his
duty
to
learn
of
course
it
will
not
do
to
think
that
the
people
are
never
in
the
wrong
they
have
frequently
been
so
both
in
other
countries
and
in
england
but
in
all
disputes
between
them
and
their
rulers
the
presumption
is
at
least
upon
a
par
in
favor
of
the
people
history
justifies
us
in
going
even
further
for
when
popular
discontents
have
been
very
prevalent
something
has
generally
been
found
amiss
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
conduct
of
the
government
as
burke
declares
the
people
have
no
interest
in
disorder
when
they
do
wrong
it
is
their
error
and
not
their
crime
but
with
the
governing
part
of
the
state
it
is
far
otherwise
they
certainly
may
act
ill
by
design
as
well
as
by
mistake
if
this
presumption
in
favor
of
the
subjects
against
the
trustees
of
power
be
not
the
more
probable
i
am
sure
it
is
the
more
comfortable
speculation
because
it
is
more
easy
to
change
an
administration
than
to
reform
a
people
very
much
the
same
ideas
are
presented
by
otis
in
his
article
on
the
rights
of
the
colonists
and
the
passage
bearing
on
this
present
topic
will
be
given
for
comparison
with
treatment
the
pamphlet
is
divided
into
four
parts
treating
respectively
of
the
origin
of
government
of
colonies
in
general
of
the
natural
rights
of
colonists
and
of
the
political
and
civil
rights
of
the
british
colonists
the
writer
maintains
that
government
is
founded
not
as
some
had
supposed
on
compact
but
as
paley
afterwards
affirmed
on
the
will
of
god
by
the
divine
will
the
supreme
power
is
placed
originally
and
ultimately
in
the
people
and
they
never
did
in
fact
freely
nor
can
they
rightfully
make
an
absolute
unlimited
renunciation
of
this
divine
right
it
is
ever
in
the
nature
of
a
thing
given
in
trust
and
on
a
condition
the
performance
of
which
no
mortal
can
dispense
with
namely
that
the
person
or
persons
on
whom
the
sovereignty
is
conferred
by
the
people
shall
incessantly
consult
their
good
tyranny
of
all
kinds
is
to
be
abhorred
whether
it
be
in
the
hands
of
one
or
of
the
few
or
of
the
many
the
colonies
were
not
at
all
unwilling
to
pay
revenue
to
the
home
government
if
the
manner
of
payment
was
just
and
right
they
were
so
far
from
refusing
to
grant
money
that
the
assembly
of
pennsylvania
resolved
to
the
following
effect
that
they
always
had
so
they
always
should
think
it
their
duty
to
grant
aid
to
the
crown
according
to
their
abilities
whenever
required
of
them
in
the
usual
constitutional
manner
this
resolution
was
presented
by
franklin
who
was
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania
assembly
to
the
prime
minister
of
england
grenville
before
the
latter
introduced
the
stamp
act
into
parliament
other
colonies
made
similar
resolutions
and
had
grenville
instead
of
the
stamp
act
applied
to
the
king
for
proper
requisitional
letters
to
be
circulated
among
the
colonies
by
the
secretary
of
state
it
is
highly
probable
that
he
would
have
obtained
more
money
from
the
colonies
by
their
voluntary
grants
than
he
himself
expected
from
the
stamps
such
at
any
rate
is
the
claim
of
franklin
who
was
surely
in
a
position
to
feel
the
pulse
of
the
colonies
better
than
any
other
one
man
but
he
grenville
chose
compulsion
rather
than
persuasion
and
would
not
receive
from
their
what
he
thought
he
could
obtain
without
it
thus
the
golden
bridge
which
the
americans
were
charged
with
unwisely
and
unbecomingly
refusing
to
hold
out
to
the
minister
and
parliament
was
actually
held
out
to
them
but
they
refused
to
walk
over
it
the
action
of
the
english
ministry
in
the
matter
of
the
tea
tax
in
particular
and
of
the
whole
question
of
american
taxation
in
general
is
thus
spoken
of
by
burke
in
his
famous
address
in
the
house
of
commons
there
is
nothing
simple
nothing
manly
nothing
ingenious
open
decisive
or
steady
in
the
proceeding
with
regard
either
to
the
continuance
or
the
repeal
of
the
taxes
the
whole
has
an
air
of
littleness
and
fraud
there
is
no
fair
dealing
in
any
part
of
the
transaction
no
man
ever
doubted
that
the
commodity
of
tea
could
bear
an
imposition
of
but
no
commodity
will
bear
or
will
bear
a
penny
when
the
general
feelings
of
men
are
irritated
and
two
millions
of
people
are
resolved
not
to
pay
the
feelings
of
the
colonists
were
formerly
the
feelings
of
great
britain
theirs
were
formerly
the
feelings
of
hampden
when
called
upon
for
the
payment
of
twenty
shillings
would
twenty
shillings
have
ruined
hampden
fortune
no
but
the
payment
of
half
twenty
shillings
on
the
principle
it
was
demanded
would
have
made
him
a
slave
it
is
then
upon
the
principle
of
this
measure
and
nothing
else
that
we
are
at
issue
i
select
the
obnoxious
colony
of
massachusetts
bay
which
at
this
time
but
without
hearing
her
is
so
heavily
a
culprit
before
parliament
i
will
select
their
proceedings
even
under
circumstances
of
no
small
irritation
for
a
little
imprudently
i
must
say
governor
bernard
mixed
in
the
administration
of
the
lenitive
of
the
repeal
no
small
acrimony
arising
from
matters
of
a
separate
nature
yet
see
sir
the
effect
of
that
lenitive
though
mixed
with
these
bitter
ingredients
and
how
this
rugged
people
can
express
themselves
on
a
measure
of
concession
it
is
not
in
our
power
say
they
in
their
address
to
governor
bernard
in
so
full
a
manner
as
will
be
expected
to
show
our
respectful
gratitude
to
the
mother
country
or
to
make
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
return
to
the
indulgence
of
the
king
and
parliament
it
shall
be
no
fault
of
ours
for
this
we
intend
and
hope
we
shall
be
able
fully
to
effect
would
to
god
that
this
tender
had
been
cultivated
managed
and
set
in
action
other
effects
than
those
which
we
have
since
felt
would
have
resulted
from
it
on
the
requisition
for
compensation
to
those
who
had
suffered
from
the
violence
of
the
populace
in
the
same
address
they
say
recommendation
enjoined
by
secretary
conway
letter
and
in
consequence
thereof
made
to
us
we
will
embrace
the
first
convenient
opportunity
to
consider
and
act
upon
they
did
consider
they
did
act
upon
it
they
obeyed
the
requisition
i
know
the
mode
has
been
chicaned
upon
but
it
was
substantially
obeyed
and
much
better
obeyed
than
i
fear
the
parliamentary
requisition
of
this
session
will
be
though
enforced
by
all
your
rigour
and
backed
with
all
your
power
in
a
word
the
damages
of
popular
fury
were
compensated
by
legislative
gravity
almost
every
other
part
of
america
in
various
ways
demonstrated
their
gratitude
i
am
bold
to
say
that
so
sudden
a
calm
recovered
after
so
violent
a
storm
is
without
parallel
in
history
to
say
that
no
other
disturbance
should
happen
from
any
other
cause
is
folly
but
as
far
as
appearances
went
by
the
judicious
sacrifice
of
one
law
you
procured
an
acquiescence
in
all
that
remained
after
this
experience
nobody
shall
persuade
me
when
a
whole
people
are
concerned
that
acts
of
lenity
are
not
means
of
conciliation
arbitrary
power
by
john
wilkes
while
otis
and
other
patriots
were
opposing
the
arbitrary
measures
of
the
english
ministry
in
their
dealings
with
the
colonies
certain
men
in
england
were
equally
as
ardent
in
their
opposition
to
such
a
course
whether
pursued
at
home
or
abroad
most
prominent
among
these
were
edmund
burke
and
john
wilkes
both
members
of
parliament
in
this
connection
the
following
extracts
frown
wilkes
article
on
opposition
to
arbitrary
power
will
be
of
interest
this
article
appeared
in
the
famous
no
of
the
north
briton
edited
by
wilkes
who
was
very
clever
but
somewhat
profligate
in
vain
will
such
a
minister
referring
to
lord
bute
or
the
foul
dregs
of
his
power
the
tools
of
corruption
and
despotism
preach
up
in
the
speech
that
spirit
of
concord
and
that
obedience
to
the
laws
which
is
essential
to
good
order
they
have
sent
the
spirit
of
discord
through
the
land
and
i
will
prophesy
that
it
will
never
be
extinguished
but
by
the
extinction
of
their
power
is
the
spirit
of
concord
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
peace
and
excise
through
this
nation
is
it
to
be
expected
between
an
insolent
excisemen
and
a
peer
gentleman
freeholder
or
farmer
whose
private
houses
are
now
made
liable
to
be
entered
and
searched
at
pleasure
the
spirit
of
concord
hath
not
gone
forth
among
men
but
the
spirit
of
liberty
has
and
a
noble
opposition
has
been
given
to
the
wicked
instruments
of
oppression
a
nation
as
sensible
as
the
english
will
see
that
a
spirit
of
concord
when
they
are
oppressed
means
a
tame
submission
to
injury
and
that
a
spirit
of
liberty
ought
then
to
arise
and
i
am
sure
ever
will
in
proportion
to
the
weight
of
the
grievance
they
feel
every
legal
attempt
of
a
contrary
tendency
to
the
spirit
of
concord
will
be
deemed
a
justifiable
resistance
warranted
by
the
spirit
of
the
english
constitution
a
despotic
minister
will
always
endeavor
to
dazzle
his
prince
with
ideas
of
the
prerogative
and
honor
of
the
crown
which
the
minister
will
make
a
parade
of
firmly
maintaining
i
wish
as
much
as
any
man
in
the
kingdom
to
see
the
honor
of
the
crown
maintained
in
a
manner
truly
becoming
royalty
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
is
to
exert
the
constitutional
powers
entrusted
to
it
in
a
way
not
of
blind
favor
and
partiality
but
of
wisdom
and
judgment
this
is
the
spirit
of
our
constitution
the
people
too
have
their
prerogative
and
i
hope
the
fine
words
of
dryden
will
be
engraven
on
our
hearts
is
the
english
subject

joseph

of

bernard
otis
principal
enemy
governor
bernard
bad
temper
and
bad
taste
in
dealing
with
the
legislature
may
justly
be
ranked
among
the
principal
causes
which
gradually
but
effectually
alienated
the
affections
of
the
people
of
massachusetts
first
from
the
persons
immediately
charged
with
the
government
of
the
province
and
finally
from
the
royal
authority
and
whole
english
dominion
with
an
arrogant
and
manner
constantly
identifying
himself
with
the
authority
of
which
he
was
merely
the
representative
and
constantly
indulging
in
irritating
personal
allusions
he
entirely
lost
sight
of
the
courtesy
and
respect
due
to
a
branch
of
the
government
and
made
himself
ridiculous
while
he
was
ruining
the
interests
of
the
sovereign
whom
he
was
most
anxious
to
serve
even
hutchinson
as
we
learn
from
the
third
volume
of
his
history
though
he
was
attached
to
the
same
policy
and
favored
the
same
measures
censures
the
tone
of
bernard
messages
as
ungracious
impolitic
and
offensive
popular
animosity
against
governor
bernard
waxed
exceedingly
strong
during
the
controversy
concerning
the
circular
letter
sent
by
the
massachusetts
assembly
to
each
house
of
representatives
in
the
thirteen
colonies
in
which
the
colonies
were
urged
to
concert
a
uniform
plan
for
remonstrance
against
the
government
policy
bernard
sent
advices
to
england
declaring
that
stringent
measures
were
imperative
among
those
who
were
particularly
vehement
in
their
denunciation
of
bernard
character
and
conduct
was
joseph
warren
a
young
physician
of
years
otis
for
some
time
a
writer
for
the
papers
who
was
even
more
drastic
than
otis
in
his
arraignment
of
bernard
tactics
as
governor
and
who
caused
somewhat
of
a
sensation
by
publishing
the
following
in
the
boston
gazette
of
february
warren
was
killed
while
serving
as
a
volunteer
aide
at
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
we
have
for
a
long
time
known
your
enmity
to
this
province
we
have
had
full
proof
of
your
cruelty
to
a
loyal
people
no
age
has
perhaps
furnished
a
more
glaring
instance
of
obstinate
perseverance
in
the
path
of
malice
could
you
have
reaped
any
advantage
from
injuring
this
people
there
would
have
been
some
excuse
for
the
manifold
abuses
with
which
you
have
loaded
them
but
when
a
diabolical
thirst
for
mischief
is
the
alone
motive
of
your
conduct
you
must
not
wonder
if
you
are
treated
with
open
dislike
for
it
is
impossible
how
much
soever
we
endeavor
it
to
feel
any
esteem
for
a
man
like
you
nothing
has
ever
been
more
intolerable
than
your
insolence
upon
a
late
occasion
when
you
had
by
your
jesuitical
insinuations
induced
a
worthy
minister
of
state
to
form
a
most
unfavorable
opinion
of
the
province
in
general
and
some
of
the
most
respectable
inhabitants
in
particular
you
had
the
effrontery
to
produce
a
letter
from
his
lordship
as
a
proof
of
your
success
in
calumniating
us
we
never
can
treat
good
and
patriotic
rulers
with
too
great
reverence
but
it
is
certain
that
men
totally
abandoned
to
wickedness
can
never
merit
our
regard
be
their
stations
ever
so
high
such
men
are
by
god
appointed
the
devil
may
be
the
anointed
a
true
patriot
hutchinson
tried
to
induce
the
grand
jury
to
indict
warren
for
libel
on
account
of
this
intemperate
attack
the
jury
however
returned
ignoramus
and
the
governor
had
to
bear
the
affront
which
was
but
one
of
a
series
directed
against
him
during
his
remaining
days
in
america
on
the
other
hand
direct
attacks
were
also
made
against
otis
and
some
were
marked
by
scurrility
and
coarseness
of
language
which
could
not
fail
to
arouse
a
man
of
his
temper
and
fine
sense
of
honor
how
he
did
regard
them
appears
from
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
to
his
sister
warren
tell
my
dear
brother
warren
to
give
himself
no
concern
about
the
scurrilous
piece
in
tom
fleet
paper
it
has
served
me
as
much
as
the
song
did
last
year
the
tories
are
all
ashamed
of
this
as
they
were
of
that
the
author
is
not
yet
certainly
known
though
i
think
i
am
within
a
week
of
detecting
him
for
certain
if
i
should
i
shall
try
to
cure
him
once
for
all
by
stringing
him
up
not
bodily
but
in
such
a
way
as
shall
gibbet
his
memory
in
terrorem
it
lies
between
bernard
waterhouse
and
jonathan
sewall
the
first
they
say
has
not
wit
enough
to
write
anything
the
second
swears
off
and
the
third
must
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
as
soon
as
i
see
him
till
matters
are
settled
in
england
i
dare
not
leave
this
town
as
men
minds
are
in
such
a
situation
that
every
nerve
is
requisite
to
keep
them
from
running
to
some
irregularity
and
imprudence
and
some
are
yet
wishing
for
an
opportunity
to
hurt
the
country
otis
affection
for
england
in
spite
of
his
opposition
to
the
arbitrary
measures
of
her
ministry
by
charles
edmunds
ph
otis
defended
the
rights
of
his
countrymen
by
vindicating
their
enjoyment
of
english
liberty
not
by
asserting
the
demand
for
american
independence
he
however
sowed
the
seed
without
knowing
what
kind
of
harvest
it
was
to
produce
for
his
writings
and
speeches
did
more
than
those
of
any
other
man
toward
preparing
the
minds
of
others
for
the
final
separation
from
england
that
such
was
his
purpose
he
steadfastly
repudiated
and
the
following
quotations
from
his
pen
exhibit
full
well
his
attachment
to
the
mother
country
and
to
the
principles
of
her
constitution
when
in
january
the
joyful
news
was
received
at
boston
that
the
preliminaries
of
peace
between
great
britain
and
france
had
been
signed
and
that
canada
was
permanently
annexed
to
the
former
country
the
colonists
justly
rejoiced
and
a
town
meeting
was
held
of
which
otis
was
chosen
moderator
in
the
course
of
his
speech
otis
declared
in
his
usual
earnest
way
that
the
true
interests
of
great
britain
and
her
plantations
are
mutual
and
what
god
in
his
providence
united
let
no
man
dare
attempt
to
pull
asunder
similar
sentiments
expressed
by
other
leaders
among
the
various
colonies
might
be
quoted
we
give
one
more
from
otis
pamphlet
on
the
rights
of
the
colonies
published
in
in
speaking
of
the
colonists
he
says
their
loyalty
has
been
abundantly
proved
especially
in
the
late
war
their
affection
and
reverence
for
their
mother
country
are
unquestionable
they
yield
the
most
cheerful
and
ready
obedience
to
her
laws
particularly
to
the
power
of
that
august
body
the
parliament
of
great
britain
the
supreme
legislative
of
the
kingdom
and
its
dominions
these
i
declare
are
my
own
sentiments
of
duty
and
loyalty
he
angrily
repels
the
charge
that
the
colonies
were
seeking
for
independence
insisting
that
the
people
had
a
natural
and
almost
mechanical
affection
for
great
britain
which
they
conceive
under
no
other
sense
and
call
by
no
other
name
than
that
of
home
we
all
think
ourselves
happy
under
great
britain
we
love
esteem
and
reverence
our
mother
country
and
adore
our
king
and
could
the
choice
of
independency
be
offered
the
colonies
or
subjection
to
great
britain
on
any
terms
above
absolute
slavery
i
am
convinced
they
would
accept
the
latter
in
he
wrote
the
cause
of
america
is
in
my
humble
opinion
the
cause
of
the
whole
british
empire
an
empire
which
from
my
youth
i
have
been
taught
to
love
and
revere
as
founded
in
the
principles
of
natural
reason
and
justice
and
upon
the
whole
best
calculated
for
general
happiness
of
any
yet
risen
in
the
world
in
this
view
of
the
british
empire
my
lord
i
sincerely
pray
for
its
prosperity
and
sincerely
lament
all
adverse
circumstances
situated
as
we
are
my
lord
in
the
wilderness
of
america
a
thousand
leagues
distant
from
the
fountains
of
honor
and
justice
in
all
our
distresses
we
pride
ourselves
in
loyalty
to
the
king
and
affection
to
the
mother
country
otis
as
a
prophet
otis
was
not
much
given
to
general
speculations
upon
the
future
but
there
is
something
very
striking
in
the
following
language
taken
from
his
pamphlet
the
rights
of
the
colonies
if
we
consider
how
soon
after
there
occurred
the
two
great
crises
in
the
world
affairs
the
american
and
french
revolutions
i
pretend
neither
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
nor
to
any
uncommon
skill
in
predicting
a
crisis
much
less
to
tell
when
it
begins
to
be
nascent
or
is
fairly
midwived
into
the
world
but
i
should
say
the
world
was
at
the
eve
of
the
highest
scene
of
earthly
power
and
grandeur
that
has
ever
yet
been
displayed
to
the
view
of
mankind
the
cards
are
shuffling
fast
through
all
europe
who
will
win
the
prize
is
with
god
this
however
i
know
detur
digniori
the
next
universal
monarchy
will
be
favorable
to
the
human
race
for
it
must
be
founded
on
the
principles
of
equity
moderation
and
justice
james
otis
by
mercer
adam
the
character
and
of
few
men
belonging
to
the
era
are
better
worth
studying
than
are
those
of
james
otis
the
of
massachusetts
who
took
so
prominent
a
part
in
opposing
england
obnoxious
stamp
act
and
in
arousing
the
american
colonies
to
a
sense
of
the
outrage
done
them
by
the
issue
of
the
arbitrary
writs
of
assistance
though
the
records
of
his
personal
life
are
somewhat
meagre
sufficient
is
known
of
otis
public
career
to
interest
students
of
his
country
history
and
entitle
him
to
the
admiration
of
all
as
one
of
the
most
earnest
and
eloquent
advocates
of
liberty
in
the
nation
and
a
sturdy
and
noble
defender
of
its
cause
at
the
critical
era
of
england
injustice
and
oppression
no
man
of
the
period
it
may
be
hazarded
did
more
yeoman
service
than
otis
did
in
the
cause
of
american
freedom
or
was
more
sensible
of
the
rights
of
the
colonists
and
of
the
injustice
done
them
by
the
motherland
in
her
assaults
on
their
civil
and
political
status
in
the
years
preceding
the
revolution
not
only
was
he
one
of
the
most
fearless
asserters
of
the
great
principles
for
which
our
forefathers
fought
and
bled
but
few
men
better
than
he
saw
more
clearly
the
malign
character
of
the
arbitrary
acts
imposed
upon
the
colonies
that
brought
about
separation
and
laid
the
foundation
of
american
independence
in
resisting
the
enforcement
of
these
acts
otis
was
actuated
not
only
by
disinterested
and
patriotic
motives
but
by
a
statesmanlike
discernment
of
their
unconstitutional
character
and
the
wrong
they
would
inflict
in
being
inconsistent
with
the
foundation
charter
of
the
massachusetts
colony
like
many
of
the
revolutionary
fathers
otis
was
not
at
heart
a
rebel
or
from
the
outset
disloyal
to
the
crown
in
its
administration
of
the
affairs
of
the
colonies
his
occupancy
of
the
crown
post
of
and
his
own
integrity
and
conscientiousness
forbid
that
idea
not
to
speak
of
his
pride
in
the
fact
that
his
ancestors
were
english
and
for
generations
had
held
high
judicial
offices
and
militia
appointments
in
the
gift
of
the
king
and
the
ministry
of
the
period
but
though
by
tradition
and
training
at
the
outset
of
his
career
a
subject
of
monarchy
and
a
true
man
in
his
official
relations
with
england
otis
was
at
the
same
time
ardent
in
his
interests
for
the
wellbeing
of
the
colonies
and
zealous
for
their
rights
and
privileges
when
these
came
into
conflict
the
stand
he
took
was
staunchly
patriotic
even
to
the
sacrifice
of
his
office
and
its
emoluments
while
in
espousing
the
popular
cause
against
the
king
and
the
ministry
he
stood
forth
as
john
adams
expressed
it
as
a
flame
of
fire
full
of
consuming
zeal
for
his
country
and
an
ardent
upholder
of
its
rights
and
prerogatives
in
assuming
this
attitude
that
otis
zeal
and
energy
were
at
times
unrestrained
and
his
language
occasionally
unguarded
and
overvehement
is
doubtless
true
but
this
was
certainly
excusable
in
a
man
of
his
ardent
temperament
and
strength
of
character
while
the
situation
of
affairs
was
such
as
to
call
not
only
for
patriotic
enthusiasm
but
for
righteous
indignation
and
heated
denunciation
in
a
cause
that
stirred
to
the
depths
the
heart
and
brain
of
an
impetuous
and
commanding
orator
nor
do
we
well
to
forget
what
this
consuming
patriotic
passion
and
heated
vindication
of
his
country
rights
cost
otis
in
the
responsibility
he
felt
and
the
solicitation
he
manifested
especially
in
the
middle
and
later
stages
of
his
strenuous
career
for
the
cause
he
had
so
keenly
at
heart
pathetic
is
the
story
of
the
ailment
that
clouded
his
closing
years
and
only
exculpatory
can
be
the
judgment
now
passed
upon
the
man
and
his
work
when
we
consider
what
the
strain
was
that
he
had
long
and
anxiously
borne
and
that
revealed
its
effects
in
periods
of
sad
mental
alienation
and
incipient
madness
to
speak
and
write
strongly
on
taxation
and
its
injustice
in
the
case
of
the
colonies
might
well
however
disturb
the
mental
equilibrium
of
even
a
strong
man
and
the
more
so
when
actively
protesting
as
otis
long
continued
to
protest
against
unlawful
encroachments
upon
the
liberties
of
the
colonies
and
the
other
arbitrary
acts
that
then
characterized
the
administration
of
the
crown
whatever
it
cost
otis
personally
to
engage
in
this
defence
the
result
as
we
all
now
know
and
admit
was
only
and
wholly
beneficent
in
the
defeat
of
an
unrighteous
autocracy
and
the
emancipation
of
a
continent
from
a
fettering
and
baleful
administration
this
herald
of
and

the
great

of

james
otis
whom
we
know
as
one
of
the
most
eloquent
orators
of
the
revolutionary
era
and
an
ardent
promoter
of
american
independence
was
educated
for
his
career
at
harvard
which
institution
he
entered
as
a
freshman
in
having
previously
been
prepared
for
college
by
the
rev
jonathan
russell
his
university
course
so
far
as
can
be
gathered
from
any
account
of
it
that
has
come
down
to
us
was
not
a
notable
one
though
he
had
a
fair
scholastic
career
and
graduated
at
the
age
of
nineteen
in
while
popular
after
a
fashion
at
college
he
was
a
bit
of
a
recluse
and
a
diligent
student
of
literature
with
a
predilection
it
is
said
for
music
playing
well
on
the
violin
after
graduating
he
wisely
spent
two
years
in
general
reading
before
entering
upon
the
study
of
the
law
which
he
did
in
under
james
gridley
a
prominent
jurist
of
massachusetts
and
sometime
crown
three
years
later
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
in
began
to
practice
his
profession
at
plymouth
mass
in
he
removed
to
boston
and
there
became
known
as
an
advocate
of
note
and
high
promise
actuated
by
nice
professional
instincts
with
a
fine
sense
of
honor
and
keenly
appreciating
it
is
recorded
his
responsibilities
in
his
relations
with
his
clients
which
led
him
to
accept
only
such
cases
as
he
could
conscientiously
defend
and
take
retainers
from
this
characteristic
scruple
in
the
lawyer
gave
him
a
high
standing
in
his
profession
and
naturally
led
to
success
at
the
bar
besides
winning
for
him
the
respect
and
admiration
of
troops
of
warm
and
attached
friends
about
this
time
he
appears
to
have
developed
uncommon
gifts
as
an
orator
and
his
rather
irascible
nature
gave
scope
to
his
keen
wit
and
powers
of
sarcasm
his
extensive
reading
and
ultimate
study
of
good
literary
models
naturally
bore
fruit
in
the
practice
of
the
forensic
art
and
gave
him
prestige
at
the
bar
as
well
as
later
on
in
taking
to
public
life
and
to
the
advocacy
of
the
rights
of
the
colonists
in
the
controversy
with
the
crown
in
when
he
had
attained
his
thirtieth
year
otis
married
ruth
cunningham
the
daughter
of
an
influential
boston
merchant
the
lady
from
all
accounts
was
undemonstrative
and
devoid
of
her
husband
patriotic
ardor
traits
that
did
not
tend
to
domestic
felicity
or
lead
on
the
wife
part
to
a
commanding
influence
over
her
vehement
and
somewhat
eccentric
husband
the
fruit
of
the
union
was
one
son
and
two
daughters
the
son
entered
the
navy
but
unhappily
died
in
his
eighteenth
year
one
of
the
daughters
the
elder
of
the
two
probably
under
the
mother
influence
angered
her
father
by
espousing
the
english
cause
and
marrying
a
captain
brown
a
british
officer
on
duty
at
boston
the
marriage
was
a
source
of
irritation
and
unhappiness
to
otis
who
after
his
had
fought
and
been
wounded
at
bunker
hill
withdrew
with
his
wife
to
england
and
was
there
disowned
and
cut
off
by
the
irate
patriot
whose
affection
was
also
dried
up
for
the
erring
daughter
the
younger
daughter
on
the
other
hand
was
a
devoted
and
patriotic
woman
who
shared
her
father
enthusiasm
for
the
popular
cause
she
married
benjamin
lincoln
of
boston
but
early
became
a
widow
by
this
time
otis
had
become
not
only
a
man
eminent
in
his
profession
in
boston
but
a
powerful
factor
in
the
public
life
of
the
city
the
new
england
commonwealth
was
then
beginning
to
be
greatly
exercised
over
the
aggressions
of
the
motherland
and
this
was
keenly
watched
by
otis
who
took
a
lively
and
patriotic
interest
in
colonial
affairs
beyond
his
profession
which
had
closely
engrossed
him
he
had
heretofore
taken
little
part
in
public
life
his
leisure
indeed
he
had
employed
more
as
a
student
of
books
rather
than
of
national
affairs
as
his
work
on
the
rudiments
of
latin
prosody
published
in
bears
witness
as
the
era
of
a
conflict
with
england
neared
he
however
altered
in
this
respect
and
became
a
zealous
advocate
of
on
the
part
of
the
crown
in
the
affairs
of
the
colonies
and
an
ardent
protester
against
english
oppression
and
injustice
soon
grievances
arose
in
the
relations
between
the
colonies
and
england
which
gave
otis
the
right
to
denounce
the
motherland
and
excite
dissaffection
among
the
people
of
the
new
world
these
grievances
arose
out
of
the
strained
commercial
relations
between
the
two
countries
and
the
attempt
of
england
to
devise
and
enforce
irritating
schemes
of
colonial
control
of
these
causes
of
outcry
in
the
new
world
the
two
chief
were
the
revival
and
rigid
execution
of
the
english
navigation
acts
designed
to
limit
the
freedom
of
the
american
colonies
in
trading
with
west
indian
ports
in
american
built
vessels
and
the
insistence
on
the
part
of
the
crown
and
the
british
government
that
the
colonies
should
be
taxed
for
the
partial
support
of
english
garrisons
in
the
country
in
the
development
of
trade
in
the
new
world
the
colonies
reasonably
felt
that
they
should
not
be
harassed
by
the
mother
country
and
so
they
permitted
commerce
to
expand
as
it
would
and
when
this
was
enjoined
by
england
they
naturally
resented
interference
by
her
and
began
to
evade
the
laws
which
she
imposed
upon
the
young
country
and
bid
defiance
to
the
crown
customs
officers
in
the
measures
resorted
to
in
the
way
of
restriction
and
imposed
penalty
this
attitude
of
the
colonists
in
ignoring
or
defying
english
laws
was
soon
now
specially
emphasized
when
the
crown
resorted
to
more
stringent
measures
to
curb
colonial
trade
and
impose
heavy
customs
duties
on
articles
entering
new
world
ports
flagrant
acts
of
evasion
followed
and
defiant
smuggling
at
length
brought
its
legal
consequences
in
the
issue
by
the
english
court
of
exchequer
of
search
warrants
or
writs
of
assistance
as
they
were
called
by
which
it
was
sought
to
put
a
stop
to
smuggling
by
resorting
to
humiliating
arbitrary
measures
sure
to
be
resented
by
the
colonies
these
writs
of
assistance
empowered
the
officers
or
others
delegated
by
them
to
board
vessels
in
port
and
enter
and
search
warehouses
and
even
the
private
homes
of
the
colonists
for
contraband
goods
and
all
importations
that
had
not
paid
toll
to
his
majesty
customs
this
attempted
rigid
execution
of
the
acts
of
trade
together
with
other
arbitrary
measures
on
the
part
of
the
crown
which
followed
such
as
the
imposition
of
the
stamp
act
and
the
coercive
levy
of
taxes
to
pay
part
of
the
cost
of
maintaining
english
troops
in
the
colonies
was
soon
to
cost
england
dear
and
end
in
the
loss
of
her
possessions
in
america
and
the
rise
of
the
new
world
republic
one
of
the
most
active
men
in
the
colonies
to
oppose
this
colonial
policy
of
england
was
as
we
know
the
patriot
james
otis
at
the
time
of
the
crown
who
took
strong
ground
against
the
writs
of
assistance
arguing
that
they
were
not
only
arbitrary
and
despotic
in
their
operation
but
unconstitutional
in
their
imposition
on
the
colony
since
they
were
irreconcilable
with
the
colonial
charters
and
a
violation
of
the
rights
and
prerogatives
of
the
people
rather
than
uphold
them
as
a
crown
officer
otis
resigned
his
post
of
and
became
a
fervent
pleader
of
the
popular
cause
and
denouncer
of
the
legal
processes
by
which
the
crown
sought
to
impose
with
its
authority
its
obnoxious
trammellings
and
restrictions
without
the
consent
of
and
in
defiance
of
the
inalienable
rights
of
the
american
people
otis
not
only
resisted
the
enforcement
by
the
king
officers
of
the
odious
warrants
and
denounced
their
arbitrary
character
but
inveighed
hotly
against
english
oppression
and
all
attempts
of
the
crown
and
its
deputy
in
the
province
the
of
massachusetts
to
restrict
the
liberties
of
the
people
and
impose
unconstitutional
laws
upon
the
colony
the
writs
of
assistance
were
of
course
defended
by
the
representatives
of
the
crown
in
the
colony
and
on
the
plea
that
without
some
such
legal
process
the
laws
could
not
be
executed
and
that
similar
writs
were
in
existence
in
england
and
made
use
of
there
on
the
authority
of
english
statutes
the
pleas
against
them
advanced
by
otis
took
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
the
writs
were
irreconcilable
with
the
charter
of
the
massachusetts
colony
that
english
precedent
for
their
enforcement
had
no
application
in
america
and
that
taxation
by
the
motherland
and
compulsory
acts
of
the
nature
of
the
writs
did
open
violence
to
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people
and
were
inherently
arbitrary
and
despotic
being
imposed
without
the
consent
of
the
colonies
and
to
their
grave
hurt
and
detriment
in
pleading
the
colonial
cause
against
the
writs
otis
struck
a
chord
in
the
heart
of
the
people
which
tingled
and
vibrated
while
stirring
up
such
opposition
to
them
that
the
authorities
were
fain
to
hold
their
hand
and
await
instructions
from
the
english
ministry
as
to
their
withdrawal
or
enforcement
the
response
of
the
home
government
was
that
they
should
be
enforced
but
little
advantage
was
taken
of
this
mandate
in
the
colonies
since
opposition
to
the
writs
had
thanks
to
the
patriot
otis
denunciation
of
them
became
almost
universal
while
the
people
had
been
roused
to
a
sharp
sense
of
their
situation
in
view
of
the
tyrannous
attitude
of
england
towards
the
colonies
and
the
next
step
taken
by
the
crown
under
prime
minister
grenville
in
threatening
them
with
the
no
less
hated
stamp
tax
this
new
fiscal
infatuation
on
the
the
english
ministry
strained
the
relations
of
the
colonies
toward
the
crown
to
almost
the
point
of
rupture
it
was
moreover
an
unwise
exhibition
of
english
stubbornness
and
impolicy
since
it
revealed
the
mistake
which
england
fell
into
at
the
time
of
considering
the
settlements
of
the
new
world
as
colonial
possessions
to
be
held
solely
for
the
financial
benefit
of
the
mother
country
rather
than
for
their
own
advancement
and
material
it
is
true
that
the
seven
years
war
which
had
been
waged
chiefly
for
the
protection
of
the
american
dependencies
of
the
crown
had
left
a
heavy
burden
of
debt
upon
england
which
she
naturally
looked
to
the
colonies
in
some
measure
to
repay
but
the
colonies
had
ready
their
argument
they
objected
to
being
taxed
without
their
consent
and
without
representation
in
the
british
parliament
besides
being
as
they
thought
sufficiently
oppressed
by
the
burden
of
customs
duties
already
imposed
upon
them
the
spirit
of
resistance
therefore
grew
and
was
ere
long
to
take
a
more
determined
and
to
england
fatal
form
for
the
stamp
act
though
later
on
repealed
was
passed
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
the
colonial
assemblies
and
the
increasing
soreness
of
feeling
in
america
against
the
mother
country
the
like
service
james
otis
did
for
the
community
of
the
new
world
in
opposing
the
writs
of
assistance
he
also
did
in
opposing
the
enforcement
of
the
stamp
act
remonstrances
suggested
by
the
patriot
love
of
independence
and
which
besides
numberless
letters
speeches
and
addresses
drew
from
the
trenchant
pen
several
able
pamphlets
one
vindicating
the
action
of
the
massachusetts
house
of
representatives
of
which
otis
was
now
a
member
in
protesting
against
england
intolerance
in
laying
grievous
taxation
on
the
colonies
and
the
others
upholding
the
rights
of
the
colonies
in
resisting
the
crown
misgovernment
as
well
as
its
purpose
to
tax
the
colonies
to
defray
some
of
the
cost
england
had
incurred
in
prosecuting
the
french
and
indian
war
in
these
patriotic
services
and
labors
otis
as
a
public
man
took
an
active
and
zealous
part
besides
conducting
a
large
correspondence
as
chairman
of
the
house
committee
of
the
legislature
on
subjects
relating
to
the
weal
of
the
whole
country
nor
were
his
duties
confined
to
these
matters
alone
for
we
find
him
at
this
period
engaged
in
controversies
first
with
governor
hutchinson
and
then
with
his
successor
governor
bernard
both
of
whom
deemed
otis
an
and
incendiary
a
man
not
only
without
the
pale
of
considerate
treatment
by
lawfully
constituted
authority
in
the
colonies
but
the
object
of
contumely
and
loathing
by
the
obsequious
loyalists
of
the
motherland
and
all
who
desired
her
continued
dominance
and
supremacy
in
the
country
history
has
happily
long
since
done
justice
to
james
otis
and
seen
him
in
a
fairer
and
far
more
worthy
light
the
light
not
only
of
a
patriot
lover
of
liberty
but
an
ardent
and
invincible
defender
of
his
country
against
autocratic
encroachment
and
a
fearless
asserter
of
the
principles
which
have
become
the
foundation
stone
of
the
american
nation
in
his
masterful
way
otis
was
at
times
heedlessly
bitter
and
inveterate
in
his
prejudices
against
the
mother
country
and
the
king
officers
in
the
colony
but
we
must
remember
the
strength
as
well
as
the
ardor
of
his
affection
for
his
native
land
and
the
righteousness
of
the
cause
he
lovingly
espoused
and
so
nobly
advocated
we
must
remember
also
the
antagonisms
he
naturally
aroused
and
the
hatreds
of
which
he
was
the
object
on
the
part
of
loyal
authority
in
the
colony
which
feared
while
it
traduced
him
this
is
shown
in
the
mishap
that
befell
him
in
a
british
coffeehouse
in
boston
where
he
was
roughly
assaulted
by
a
man
named
robinson
an
ally
of
the
revenue
officers
whom
he
had
denounced
in
an
article
in
the
boston
gazette
an
attack
that
left
its
traces
in
the
mental
ailment
which
afterwards
distressingly
incapacitated
him
and
shortened
his
bright
public
career
he
nevertheless
lived
to
see
the
fruition
of
his
hopes
in
the
throwing
off
by
the
colonies
of
all
allegiance
to
britain
and
take
part
himself
in
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
the
harvest
reaped
by
his
country
from
the
seeds
of
liberty
he
had
planted
in
his
day
was
such
as
might
well
cheer
him
in
the
period
of
mental
darkness
which
fell
upon
him
and
regretfully
clouded
his
closing
years
nor
was
he
in
his
own
era
without
regard
and
honor
among
those
who
delighted
in
his
splendid
patriotism
in
the
days
of
his
manly
strength
mental
as
well
as
physical
and
who
held
him
in
high
esteem
as
a
patriot
orator
and
the
staunchly
loyal
tribune
of
the
new
world
peoples
in
these
days
of
flaccid
patriotism
and
moral
declension
in
public
life
his
example
may
well
stimulate
and
inspire
in
his
wholehearted
devotion
to
the
hopes
as
well
as
to
the
interests
of
the
colonies
most
notable
was
the
polemical
fervor
with
which
he
espoused
their
cause
and
noble
the
stand
he
took
for
liberty
and
independence
like
many
men
who
have
attained
eminence
in
public
life
james
otis
was
the
victim
in
his
day
of
detraction
and
envy
a
specially
malignant
slander
was
current
with
reference
to
him
and
his
father
at
the
period
of
the
patriot
resigning
his
crown
post
of
the
motive
for
throwing
up
his
appointment
and
pleading
the
people
cause
against
the
writs
of
assistance
it
was
at
the
time
said
was
the
disappointment
of
the
otis
family
at
the
then
vacant
going
to
governor
hutchinson
instead
of
to
colonel
james
otis
of
barnstable
father
of
our
hero
this
aspersion
of
the
fair
name
of
the
otises
as
patriots
and
gentlemen
and
the
lying
assertion
that
it
was
this
disappointment
that
led
the
otises
father
and
son
to
abandon
the
crown
side
for
that
of
the
people
was
cruelly
false
and
especially
so
as
hutchinson
who
got
the
post
repeats
the
falsehood
in
his
history
of
massachusetts
in
explanation
of
the
otises
turning
their
coats
and
becoming
partisans
of
the
popular
cause
nothing
could
well
be
more
unjust
and
untrue
for
both
men
were
of
far
too
honorable
a
character
and
too
ardently
patriotic
to
justify
the
slander
and
give
even
the
slightest
color
to
the
misrepresentation
were
it
necessary
more
emphatically
to
characterize
the
slander
as
false
one
might
confidently
point
to
the
happy
relations
of
the
otises
with
the
other
patriots
of
the
time
to
men
of
the
stamp
of
the
two
adams
statesmen
to
hancock
randolph
warren
and
other
leaders
of
the
revolutionary
era
as
well
as
to
the
contemporary
repute
and
influence
of
both
men
in
the
heroic
annals
of
the
colonial
period
the
times
were
indeed
trying
and
critical
and
at
the
outset
of
the
movement
for
independence
and
relief
from
the
irritating
aggressions
of
the
crown
the
attitude
we
may
be
sure
was
closely
watched
and
not
over
truthfully
reported
of
men
of
influence
who
took
the
patriot
side
and
helped
on
the
great
cause
which
was
afterwards
to
be
gloriously
and
triumphantly
crowned
but
we
pass
on
to
relate
in
a
few
brief
words
what
remains
yet
to
be
told
of
james
otis
career
and
of
the
pathetic
declining
days
of
the
hero
and
his
tragic
end
while
mind
and
body
were
intact
and
working
perfectly
in
unison
otis
continued
to
give
himself
heart
and
soul
to
the
cause
he
had
so
patriotically
and
zealously
espoused
even
when
his
malady
showed
itself
there
were
brief
returns
of
useful
activity
and
mental
alertness
only
however
to
be
followed
by
sad
relapses
into
the
of
his
powers
at
periods
of
respite
from
his
ailment
otis
took
part
fitfully
in
his
duties
as
member
of
the
massachusetts
legislature
of
which
body
he
had
been
speaker
and
did
what
he
could
to
further
the
work
of
legislation
he
also
at
this
time
appeared
once
or
twice
as
an
advocate
in
court
and
also
continued
his
correspondence
in
committee
of
the
general
assembly
with
prominent
men
in
the
other
colonies
seeking
successfully
cooperation
with
them
in
the
great
drama
of
the
time
but
for
the
most
part
we
now
find
him
a
considerately
guest
of
his
friend
colonel
samuel
osgood
at
the
latter
farmhouse
at
andover
here
the
distinguished
had
phenomenal
premonitions
of
the
coming
manner
of
his
death
related
to
his
sister
warren
to
whom
the
patriot
on
more
than
one
occasion
said
that
when
god
in
his
providence
should
take
him
hence
into
the
eternal
world
he
hoped
it
would
be
by
a
stroke
of
lightning
this
tragic
fate
was
ere
long
to
be
his
for
on
the
afternoon
of
may
when
otis
was
standing
amid
a
family
group
at
the
door
of
the
osgood
homestead
at
andover
a
bolt
from
the
blue
flashed
down
from
aloft
and
felled
the
hero
to
the
ground
death
was
instantaneous
and
happily
it
left
no
mark
or
contortion
on
his
body
while
his
features
had
the
repose
and
placidity
of
seeming
sleep
thus
passed
the
hero
from
the
scenes
of
earth
and
in
a
sense
fitly
for
the
period
was
that
which
saw
the
close
of
the
drama
of
the
revolution
he
had
been
instrumental
in
bringing
about
and
the
departure
from
the
soil
of
the
republic
of
the
last
of
the
english
soldiery
historian
biographer
essayist
author
of
a
precis
of
english
history
a
continuation
of
grecian
history
and
for
many
years
editor
of
the
publishers
james
on
the
writs
assistance
february
may
it
please
your
honours
i
was
desired
by
one
of
the
court
to
look
into
the
law
books
and
consider
the
question
now
before
them
concerning
writs
of
assistance
i
have
accordingly
considered
it
and
now
appear
not
only
in
obedience
to
your
order
but
likewise
in
behalf
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
town
who
have
presented
another
petition
and
out
of
regard
to
the
liberties
of
the
subject
and
i
take
this
opportunity
to
declare
that
whether
under
a
fee
or
not
for
in
such
a
cause
as
this
i
despise
a
fee
i
will
to
my
dying
day
oppose
with
all
the
powers
and
faculties
god
has
given
me
all
such
instruments
of
slavery
on
the
one
hand
and
villainly
on
the
other
as
this
writ
of
assistance
is
it
appears
to
me
the
worst
instrument
of
arbitrary
power
the
most
destructive
of
english
liberty
and
the
fundamental
principles
of
law
that
ever
was
found
in
an
english
lawbook
i
must
therefore
beg
your
honours
patience
and
attention
to
the
whole
range
of
an
argument
that
may
perhaps
appear
uncommon
in
many
things
as
well
as
to
points
of
learning
that
are
more
remote
and
unusual
that
the
whole
tendency
of
my
design
may
the
more
easily
be
perceived
the
conclusions
better
descend
and
the
force
of
them
be
better
felt
i
shall
not
think
much
of
my
pains
in
this
cause
as
i
engaged
in
it
from
principle
i
was
solicited
to
argue
this
case
as
and
because
i
would
not
i
have
been
charged
with
desertion
from
my
office
to
this
charge
i
can
give
a
very
sufficient
answer
i
renounced
that
office
and
i
argue
this
cause
from
the
same
principle
and
i
argue
it
with
the
greatest
pleasure
as
it
is
in
favour
of
british
liberty
at
a
time
when
we
hear
the
greatest
monarch
upon
earth
declaring
from
his
throne
that
he
glories
in
the
name
of
briton
and
that
the
privileges
of
his
people
are
dearer
to
him
than
the
most
valuable
prerogatives
of
his
crown
and
as
it
is
in
opposition
to
a
kind
of
power
the
exercise
of
which
in
former
periods
of
history
cost
one
king
of
england
his
head
and
another
his
crown
i
have
taken
more
pains
in
this
cause
than
i
ever
will
take
again
although
my
engaging
in
this
and
another
popular
cause
has
raised
much
resentment
but
i
think
i
can
sincerely
declare
that
i
cheerfully
submit
myself
to
every
odious
name
for
conscience
sake
and
from
my
soul
i
despise
all
those
whose
guilt
malice
or
folly
has
made
them
my
foes
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
will
i
am
determined
to
proceed
the
only
principles
of
public
conduct
that
are
worthy
of
a
gentleman
or
a
man
are
to
sacrifice
estate
ease
health
and
applause
and
even
life
to
the
sacred
calls
of
his
country
these
manly
sentiments
in
private
life
make
good
citizens
in
public
life
the
patriot
and
the
hero
i
do
not
say
that
when
brought
to
the
test
i
shall
be
invincible
i
pray
god
i
may
never
be
brought
to
the
melancholy
trial
but
if
ever
i
should
it
will
then
be
known
how
far
i
can
reduce
to
practice
principles
which
i
know
to
be
founded
in
truth
in
the
meantime
i
will
proceed
to
the
subject
of
this
writ
in
the
first
place
may
it
please
your
honours
i
will
admit
that
writs
of
one
kind
may
be
legal
that
is
special
writs
directed
to
special
officers
and
to
search
certain
houses
specially
set
forth
in
the
writ
may
be
granted
by
the
court
of
exchequer
at
home
upon
oath
made
before
the
lord
treasurer
by
the
person
who
asks
it
that
he
suspects
such
goods
to
be
concealed
in
those
very
places
he
desires
to
search
the
act
of
charles
which
gridley
mentions
proves
this
and
in
this
light
the
writ
appears
like
a
warrant
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
to
search
for
stolen
goods
your
honours
will
find
in
the
old
books
concerning
the
office
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
precedents
of
general
warrants
to
search
suspected
houses
but
in
more
modern
books
you
will
find
only
special
warrants
to
search
such
and
such
houses
specially
named
in
which
the
complainant
has
before
sworn
that
he
suspects
his
goods
are
concealed
and
will
find
it
adjudged
that
special
warrants
only
are
legal
in
the
same
manner
i
rely
on
it
that
the
writ
prayed
for
in
this
petition
is
illegal
it
is
a
power
that
places
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
the
hands
of
every
petty
officer
i
say
i
admit
that
special
writs
of
assistance
to
search
special
places
may
be
granted
to
certain
persons
on
oath
but
i
deny
that
the
writ
now
prayed
for
can
be
granted
for
i
beg
leave
to
make
some
observations
on
the
writ
itself
before
i
proceed
to
other
acts
of
parliament
in
the
first
place
the
writ
is
universal
being
directed
to
all
and
singular
justices
sheriffs
constables
and
all
other
officers
and
subjects
so
that
in
short
it
is
directed
to
every
subject
in
the
domains
every
one
with
this
writ
may
be
a
tyrant
if
this
commission
be
legal
a
tyrant
in
a
legal
manner
also
may
control
imprison
or
murder
any
one
within
the
realm
in
the
next
place
it
is
perpetual
there
is
no
return
a
man
is
accountable
to
no
person
for
his
doings
every
man
may
reign
secure
in
his
petty
tyranny
and
spread
terror
and
desolation
around
him
until
the
trump
of
the
archangel
shall
excite
different
emotions
in
his
soul
in
the
third
place
a
person
with
this
writ
in
the
daytime
may
enter
all
houses
shops
at
will
and
command
all
to
assist
him
fourthly
by
this
writ
not
only
deputies
but
even
their
menial
servants
are
allowed
to
lord
it
over
us
what
is
this
but
to
have
the
curse
of
canaan
with
a
witness
on
us
t
o
be
the
servants
of
servants
the
most
despicable
of
god
creation
now
one
of
the
most
essential
branches
of
english
liberty
is
the
freedom
of
house
a
man
house
is
his
castle
and
whilst
he
is
quiet
he
is
as
well
guarded
as
a
prince
in
his
castle
this
writ
if
it
should
be
declared
legal
would
totally
annihilate
this
privilege
officers
may
enter
our
houses
when
they
please
we
are
commanded
to
permit
their
entry
their
menial
servants
may
enter
may
break
locks
bars
and
everything
in
their
way
and
whether
they
break
through
malice
or
revenge
no
man
no
court
can
inquire
bare
suspicion
without
oath
is
sufficient
this
wanton
exercise
of
this
power
is
not
a
chimerical
suggestion
of
a
heated
brain
i
will
mention
some
facts
pew
had
one
of
these
writs
and
when
ware
succeeded
him
he
endorsed
this
writ
over
to
ware
so
that
these
writs
are
negotiable
from
one
officer
to
another
and
so
your
honours
have
no
opportunity
of
judging
the
persons
to
whom
this
vast
power
is
delegated
another
instance
is
this
justice
walley
had
called
this
same
ware
before
him
by
a
constable
for
a
breach
of
the
acts
or
that
of
profane
swearing
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
ware
asked
him
if
he
had
done
he
replied
yes
well
then
said
ware
i
will
show
you
a
little
of
my
power
i
command
you
to
permit
me
to
search
your
house
for
uncustomed
goods
and
went
on
to
search
the
house
from
garret
to
cellar
and
then
served
the
constable
in
the
same
manner
but
to
show
another
absurdity
in
this
writ
if
it
should
be
established
i
insist
upon
it
every
person
by
the
charles
has
this
power
as
well
as
the
officers
the
words
are
it
shall
be
lawful
for
any
person
or
persons
authorized
etc
what
a
scene
does
this
open
every
man
prompted
by
revenge
or
wantonness
to
inspect
the
inside
of
his
neighbour
house
may
get
a
writ
of
assistance
others
will
ask
it
from
self
defence
one
arbitrary
exertion
will
provoke
another
until
society
be
involved
in
tumult
and
in
blood
again
these
writs
are
not
returned
writs
in
their
nature
are
temporary
things
when
the
purposes
for
which
they
are
issued
are
answered
they
exist
no
more
but
these
live
forever
no
one
can
be
called
to
account
thus
reason
and
the
constitution
are
both
against
this
writ
let
us
see
what
authority
there
is
for
it
not
more
than
one
instance
can
be
found
of
it
in
all
our
and
that
was
in
the
zenith
of
arbitrary
power
namely
in
the
reign
of
charles
when
powers
were
pushed
to
extremity
by
some
ignorant
clerk
of
the
exchequer
but
had
this
writ
been
in
any
book
whatever
it
would
have
been
illegal
all
precedents
are
under
the
control
of
the
principles
of
law
lord
talbot
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
an
english
peer
of
the
era
of
william
and
mary
says
it
is
better
to
observe
these
than
any
precedents
though
in
the
house
of
lords
the
last
resort
of
the
subject
no
acts
of
parliament
can
establish
such
a
writ
though
it
should
be
made
in
the
very
words
of
the
petition
it
would
be
void
an
act
against
the
constitution
is
void
but
this
proves
no
more
than
what
i
before
observed
that
special
writs
may
be
granted
on
oath
and
probable
suspicion
the
act
of
and
william
iii
that
the
officers
of
the
plantations
shall
have
the
same
powers
is
confined
to
this
sense
that
an
officer
should
show
probable
ground
should
take
his
oath
of
it
should
do
this
before
a
magistrate
and
that
such
magistrate
if
he
think
proper
should
issue
a
special
warrant
to
a
constable
to
search
the
places
that
of
anne
can
prove
no
more
otis
opponent
his
legal
preceptor
who
argued
in
favor
of
the
writs
james
otis
on
the
stamp
act
an
oration
delivered
before
the
governor
and
council
in
boston
december
it
is
with
great
grief
that
i
appear
before
your
excellency
governor
hutchinson
and
honours
of
the
city
council
on
this
occasion
a
wicked
and
unfeeling
minister
earl
grenville
has
caused
a
people
the
most
loyal
and
affectionate
that
ever
king
was
blest
with
to
groan
under
the
most
insupportable
oppression
but
i
think
sir
that
he
now
stands
upon
the
brink
of
inevitable
destruction
and
trust
that
soon
very
soon
he
will
feel
the
full
weight
of
his
injured
sovereign
righteous
indignation
i
have
no
doubt
sir
but
that
the
loyal
and
dutiful
representations
of
nine
provinces
the
cries
and
supplications
of
a
distressed
people
the
united
voice
of
all
his
majesty
most
loyal
and
affectionate
subjects
will
obtain
all
that
ample
redress
which
they
have
a
right
to
expect
and
that
erelong
they
will
see
their
cruel
and
insidious
enemies
both
at
home
and
abroad
put
to
shame
and
confusion
my
brother
adams
has
entered
so
largely
into
the
validity
of
the
act
that
i
shall
not
enlarge
on
that
head
indeed
what
has
been
observed
is
sufficient
to
convince
the
most
illiterate
savage
that
the
parliament
of
england
had
no
regard
to
the
very
first
principles
of
their
own
liberties
only
the
preamble
of
that
oppressive
act
is
enough
to
rouse
the
blood
of
every
generous
we
your
majesty
subjects
the
commons
of
great
britain
do
give
and
grant
what
their
own
property
no
the
treasure
the
heart
blood
of
all
your
majesty
dutiful
and
affectionate
subjects
but
the
time
is
far
spent
i
will
not
tire
your
patience
it
was
once
a
fundamental
maxim
that
every
subject
had
the
same
right
to
his
life
liberty
property
and
the
law
that
the
king
had
to
his
crown
and
is
yet
i
venture
to
say
as
much
as
a
crown
is
worth
to
deny
the
subject
his
law
which
is
his
birthright
is
a
first
principle
that
majesty
should
not
only
shine
in
arms
but
be
armed
with
the
laws
the
administration
of
justice
is
necessary
to
the
very
existence
of
governments
nothing
can
warrant
the
stopping
the
course
of
justice
but
the
impossibility
of
holding
courts
by
reason
of
war
invasion
rebellion
or
insurrection
this
was
law
at
a
time
when
the
whole
island
of
great
britain
was
divided
into
an
infinite
number
of
petty
baronies
and
principalities
as
germany
is
at
this
day
insurrections
then
and
even
invasions
put
the
whole
nation
into
such
confusion
that
justice
could
not
have
her
equal
course
especially
as
the
kings
in
ancient
times
frequently
sat
as
judges
but
war
has
now
become
so
much
of
a
science
and
gives
so
little
disturbance
to
a
nation
engaged
that
no
war
foreign
or
domestic
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
shutting
up
the
courts
but
if
it
were
we
are
not
in
such
a
state
but
far
otherwise
the
whole
people
being
willing
and
demanding
the
full
administration
of
justice
the
shutting
up
of
the
courts
is
an
abdication
a
total
dissolution
of
government
whoever
takes
from
the
king
his
executive
power
takes
from
the
king
his
kingship
the
laws
which
forbid
a
man
to
pursue
his
right
one
way
ought
to
be
understood
with
this
equitable
restriction
that
one
finds
judges
to
whom
he
may
apply
i
ca
but
observe
that
cruel
and
neglect
of
that
enemy
to
his
king
and
country
the
author
of
this
act
that
when
all
business
the
very
life
and
being
of
a
commercial
state
was
to
be
carried
on
by
the
use
of
stamps
that
wicked
and
execrable
minister
never
paid
the
least
regard
to
the
miseries
of
this
extensive
continent
but
suffered
the
time
for
the
taking
place
of
the
act
to
elapse
months
before
a
single
stamp
was
received
though
this
was
a
high
piece
of
infidelity
to
the
interest
of
his
royal
master
yet
it
makes
it
evident
that
it
could
never
be
intended
that
if
stamps
were
not
to
be
had
it
should
put
a
stop
to
all
justice
which
is
ipse
facto
a
dissolution
of
society
it
is
a
strange
kind
of
law
which
we
hear
advanced
nowadays
that
because
one
unpopular
act
ca
be
carried
into
execution
that
therefore
there
shall
be
an
end
of
all
law
we
are
not
the
first
people
who
have
risen
to
prevent
the
execution
of
a
law
the
very
people
of
england
themselves
rose
in
opposition
to
the
famous
and
got
that
immediately
repealed
and
lawyers
know
that
there
are
limits
beyond
which
if
parliaments
go
their
acts
bind
not
the
king
is
always
presumed
to
be
present
in
his
courts
holding
out
the
law
to
his
subjects
and
when
he
shuts
his
courts
he
unkings
himself
in
the
most
essential
point
magna
charter
and
the
other
statutes
are
full
that
they
will
not
defer
delay
nor
deny
any
man
justice
that
it
shall
not
be
commanded
by
the
great
seal
or
in
any
other
way
to
disturb
or
delay
common
right
the
judges
of
england
are
not
to
counsel
or
assent
to
anything
which
may
turn
to
the
damage
or
disherison
of
the
crown
they
are
sworn
not
to
deny
to
any
man
common
right
by
the
king
letters
nor
none
other
man
nor
for
none
other
cause
is
not
the
dissolution
of
society
a
disherison
of
the
crown
the
justices
are
commanded
that
they
shall
do
even
law
and
execution
of
right
to
all
our
subjects
rich
and
poor
without
having
regard
to
any

anecdotes
and
characteristics
of
otis
etc
otis
and
his
fellow
patriots
professor
hosmer
draws
the
following
pictures
of
otis
and
his
contemporaries
the
splendid
otis
whose
leadership
was
at
first
unquestioned
was
like
the
huge
cannon
on
the
in
victor
story
that
had
broken
from
its
moorings
in
the
storm
and
become
a
terror
to
those
whom
it
formerly
defended
he
was
indeed
a
great
gun
from
whom
in
the
time
of
the
stamp
act
had
been
sent
the
most
powerful
bolts
against
unconstitutional
oppression
with
lashings
parted
however
as
the
storm
grew
violent
he
plunged
dangerously
from
side
to
side
almost
sinking
the
ship
all
the
more
an
object
to
dread
from
the
calibre
that
had
once
made
him
so
serviceable
it
was
a
melancholy
sight
and
yet
a
great
relief
when
his
friends
saw
him
at
last
bound
hand
and
foot
and
carried
into
retirement
bowdoin
also
was
not
firm
in
health
and
though
most
active
and
useful
in
the
council
had
thus
far
done
little
elsewhere
hawley
far
in
the
interior
was
often
absent
from
the
centre
in
critical
times
and
somewhat
unreliable
through
a
strange
moodiness
cushing
was
weak
hancock
was
hampered
by
foibles
that
some
times
quite
canceled
his
merits
quincy
was
a
brilliant
youth
and
like
a
youth
sometimes
fickle
we
have
seen
him
ready
to
temporize
when
to
falter
was
destruction
as
at
the
time
of
the
casting
over
of
the
tea
again
in
unwise
fervor
he
would
counsel
assassination
as
a
proper
expedient
warren
too
could
rush
into
extremes
of
rashness
and
ferocity
wishing
that
he
might
wade
to
the
knees
in
blood
and
had
just
reached
sober
manhood
when
he
was
taken
off
john
adams
showed
only
an
intermittent
zeal
in
the
public
cause
until
the
preliminary
work
was
done
and
benjamin
church
and
venal
early
began
the
which
was
to
bring
him
to
a
traitor
end
there
was
need
in
this
group
of
a
man
of
sufficient
ascendency
thorough
intellect
and
character
to
win
deference
from
all
wise
enough
to
see
always
the
supreme
end
to
know
what
each
instrument
was
fit
for
and
to
bring
all
forces
to
bear
in
the
right
way
a
man
of
consummate
adroitness
to
sail
in
waters
without
exciting
an
explosion
though
conducting
wires
of
local
prejudice
class
sensitiveness
and
personal
foible
on
every
hand
led
straight
down
to
magazines
of
wrath
which
might
shatter
the
cause
in
a
moment
a
man
having
resources
of
his
own
to
such
an
extent
that
he
could
supplement
from
himself
what
was
wanting
in
others
always
awake
though
others
might
want
to
sleep
always
at
work
though
others
might
be
tired
a
man
devoted
without
thought
of
personal
gain
or
fame
simply
and
solely
to
the
public
cause
such
a
man
there
was
and
his
name
was
samuel
adams
otis
and
adams
professor
hosmer
thus
compares
otis
and
adams
otis
power
was
so
magnetic
that
a
boston
town
meeting
upon
his
mere
entering
would
break
out
into
shouts
and
clapping
and
if
he
spoke
he
produced
effects
which
may
be
compared
with
the
sway
exercised
by
chatham
whom
as
an
orator
he
much
resembled
long
after
disease
had
made
him
utterly
untrustworthy
his
spell
remained
he
brought
the
american
cause
to
the
brink
of
ruin
because
the
people
would
follow
him
though
he
was
shattered
of
this
gift
samuel
adams
possessed
little
he
was
always
in
speech
straightforward
and
sensible
and
upon
occasion
could
be
impressive
but
his
endowment
was
not
that
of
the
mouth
of
gold
while
otis
was
fitful
vacillating
and
morbid
samuel
adams
was
persistent
undeviating
and
sanity
itself
while
samuel
adams
never
abated
by
a
hair
his
opposition
to
the
british
policy
james
otis
who
at
the
outset
had
given
the
to
the
patriots
later
after
parliament
had
passed
the
stamp
act
said
is
the
duty
of
all
humbly
and
silently
to
acquiesce
in
all
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
legislature
nine
hundred
and
in
a
thousand
will
never
entertain
the
thought
but
of
submission
to
our
sovereign
and
to
the
authority
of
parliament
in
all
possible
contingencies
otis
as
an
author
in
a
pamphlet
appeared
bearing
the
following
title
a
vindication
of
the
conduct
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
province
of
the
massachusetts
bay
more
particularly
in
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly
by
james

a
member
of
said
house

such

this
sacred
floor
who

to
love
their
country
and
be

or

though
rich

and

though

but
these
we
naught
to
fear
from
fate
boston
printed
by
edes
and
gill
instead
of
copious
quotations
from
this
patriotic
work
we
present
the
following
judgment
upon
its
merits
by
one
best
qualified
to
estimate
its
worth
how
many
volumes
says
john
adams
are
concentrated
in
this
little
fugitive
pamphlet
the
production
of
a
few
hurried
hours
amidst
the
continual
solicitation
of
a
crowd
of
clients
for
his
business
at
the
bar
at
that
time
was
very
extensive
and
of
the
first
importance
and
amidst
the
host
of
politicians
suggesting
their
plans
and
schemes
look
over
the
declarations
of
rights
and
wrongs
issued
by
congress
in
look
into
the
declaration
of
independence
in
look
into
the
writings
of
price
and
priestley
look
into
all
the
french
constitutions
of
government
and
to
cap
the
climax
look
into
thomas
paine
sense
crisis
and
rights
of
man
what
can
you
find
that
is
not
to
be
found
in
solid
substance
in
this
vindication
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
town
meeting
another
important
feature
in
the
unfolding
of
our
free
institutions
was
the
system
of
town
meetings
which
began
to
be
held
as
early
as
the
chief
arena
of
james
otis
and
sam
adams
influence
as
governor
hutchinson
wrote
to

was
the

the
effect
of

set
the
universe
in
motion
one
held
in

presided
over
by
james

was
called
to
resist
new
acts
of

aggression
on

on
september
a
town
meeting
was
held
which
was
opened
with
a
prayer
by
cooper
otis
was
chosen
moderator
the
petition
for
calling
the
meeting
requested
that
inquiry
should
be
made
of
his
excellency
for
the
grounds
and
reasons
of
sundry
declarations
made
by
him
that
three
regiments
might
be
daily
expected
etc
a
committee
was
appointed
to
wait
upon
the
governor
urging
him
in
the
present
critical
state
of
affairs
to
issue
precepts
for
a
general
assembly
of
the
province
to
take
suitable
measures
for
the
preservation
of
their
rights
and
privileges
and
that
he
should
be
requested
to
favor
the
town
with
an
immediate
answer
in
october
several
of
troops
arrive
the
storm
thickens
another
town
meeting
is
called
and
it
is
voted
that
the
several

be
requested
to
appoint
the
next

in

of
the

under
circumstances
that
strongly
attest
his
heroism
cannon
were
planted
at
the
entrance
of
the
building
and
a
body
of
troops
were
quartered
in
the
representatives
chamber
after
the
court
was
opened
otis
rose
and
moved
that
they
should
adjourn
to
faneuil
hall
with
a
significant
expression
of
loathing
and
scorn
he
observed
that
the
stench
occasioned
by
the
troops
in
the
hall
of
legislation
might
prove
infectious
and
that
it
was
utterly
derogatory

by
the
house

the
sister
of

with
whom
he
was
living
at
watertown
mass
at
this
time
he
was
harmlessly
insane
and
did
not
need
special
watching
but
as
he
saw
the
patriotic
farmers
hurrying
by
and
heard
of
the
rumor
of
the
impending
conflict
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
martial
spirit
without
saying
a
word
to
a
single
soul
he
slipped
away
unobserved
and
hurried
on
towards
boston
on
the
roadside
he
stopped
at
a
farmhouse
and

hastened
on
and
was

joined
by

he
took
an

wearied
beyond

though

was

pursued
his
sad
and

two
days
before

had
been

the

entered

and
the
next
day
news
was
brought

this
put
fire
into

patrick

hearing

am
glad

england

forever
the
ancestors
of
james
otis
carlyle
says
i
never
knew
a
clever
man
who
came
out
of
entirely
stupid
people
james
otis
great
qualities
were
an
inheritance
not
an
accident
and
inheritance
from
the
best
blood
of
old
england
many
years
ago
when
george
ticknor
of
boston
was
a
guest
of
lady
holland
at
the
famous
holland
house
in
london
her
ladyship
remarked
to
him
in
her
not
very
engaging
way
i
understand
ticknor
that
massachusetts
was
settled
by
convicts
indeed
said
ticknor
i
thought
i
was
somewhat
familiar
with
the
history
of
my
state
but
i
was
not
aware
that
what
you
say
was
the
case
but
he
continued
i
do
now
remember
that
some
of
your
ladyship
ancestors
settled
in
boston
for
there
is
a
monument
to
one
of
them
in
king
chapel
james
otis
inherited
that
sturdy
new
england
pride
which
puts
manhood
above
dukedoms
and
coronets
a
king
may
make
a
belted
knight
a
marquis
duke
and
a
that
but
an
honest
man
aboon
his
might
from
a
race
of
the
true
kings
of
men
he
was
descended
who
conquered
out
of
the
jaws
of
the
wilderness
the
priceless
inheritance
of
american
privilege
and
freedom
and
while
kings
at
home
were
trying
to
crush
out
the
liberties
of
their
subjects
or
were
dallying
with
wantons
in
the
palaces
built
out
of
the
unrequited
toil
of
the
and
downtrodden
people
these
men
of
iron
were
the
pioneers
of
american
civilization
at
a
time
which
holmes
so
graphically
describes
when
the
crows
came
cawing
through
the
air
to
pluck
the
pilgrim
corn
and
bears
came
snuffing
round
the
door
wherever

barre
on
james
otis
in
the
debate
on
the
boston
port
bill
in
parliament
april
colonel
barre
referred
to
the
ruffianly
attack
made
on
otis
and
his
treatment
of
the
injury
in
a
manner
that
reflects
honor
on
both
of
the
orators
is
this
the
return
you
make
them
inquired
the
british
statesman
when
a
commissioner
of
the
customs
aided
by
a
number
of
ruffians
assaulted
the
celebrated
otis
in
the
midst
of
the
town
of
boston
and
with
the
most
barbarous
violence
almost
murdered
him
did
the
mob
which
is
said
to
rule
that
town
take
vengeance
on
the
perpetrators
of
this
inhuman
outrage
against
a
person
who
is
supposed
to
be
their
demagogue
no
sir
the
law
tried
them
the
law
gave
heavy
damages
against
them
which
the
irreparably
injured
otis
most
generously
forgave
upon
an
acknowledgment
of
the
offense
can
you
expect
any
more
such
instances
of
magnanimity
under
the
principle
of
the
bill
now
proposed
the
generosity
of
otis
he
was
distinguished
for
generosity
to
both
friends
and
foes
governor
hutchinson
said
of
him
that
he
never
knew
fairer
or
more
noble
conduct
in
a
speaker
than
in
otis
that
he
always
disdained
to
take
advantage
of
any
clerical
error
or
similar
inadvertence
but
passed
over
minor
points
and
defended
his
causes
solely
on
their
broad
and
substantial
foundations
john
adams
on
otis
but
in
that
contest
over
the
writs
of
assistance
there
was
something
nobler
exhibited
than
superiority
to
mercenary
consideration
it
was
says
the
venerable
president
john
adams
a
moral
spectacle
more
affecting
to
me
than
any
i
have
since
seen
upon
the
stage
to
observe
a
pupil
treating
his
master
with
all
the
deference
respect
esteem
and
affection
of
a
son
to
a
father
and
that
without
the
least
affectation
while
he
baffled
and
confounded
all
his
authorities
confuted
all
his
arguments
and
reduced
him
to
silence
the
crown
by
its
agents
accumulated
construction
upon
construction
and
inference
upon
inference
as
the
giants
heaped
pelion
upon
ossa
but
otis
like
jupiter
dashed
this
whole
building
to
pieces
and
scattered
the
pulverized
atoms
to
the
four
winds
and
no
judge
lawyer
or
crown
officer
dared
to
say
why
do
ye
so
he
raised
such
a
storm
of
indignation
that
even
hutchinson
who
had
been
appointed
on
purpose
to
sanction
this
writ
dared
not
utter
a
word
in
its
favor
and
gridley
himself
seemed
to
me
to
exult
inwardly
at
the
glory
and
triumph
of
his
pupil
otis
compared
with
randolph
the
wit
exemplified
by
otis
in
debate
says
magoon
was
often
keen
but
never
malignant
as
in
john
randolph
the
attacks
of
the
latter
were
often
fierce
and
virulent
not
unfrequently
in
an
inverse
proportion
to
the
necessity
of
the
case
he
would
yield
himself
up
to
a
blind
and
passionate
obstinacy
and
lacerate
his
victims
for
no
apparent
reason
but
the
mere
pleasure
of
inflicting
pangs
in
this
respect
the
orator
of
roanoke
resembled
the
sicilian
tyrant
whose
taste
for
cruelty
led
him
to
seek
recreation
in
putting
insects
to
the
torture
if
such
men
can
not
strike
strong
blows
they
know
how
to
fight
with
poisonous
weapons
thus
by
their
malignity
rather
than
by
their
honorable
skill
they
can
bring
the
noblest
antagonist
to
the
ground
but
otis
pursued
more
dignified
game
and
with
a
loftier
purpose
he
indeed
possessed
a
swiftian
gift
of
sarcasm
but
unlike
the
dean
of
patrick
and
the
forensic
gladiator
alluded
to
above
he
never
employed
it
in
a
spirit
of
hatred
and
contempt
towards
the
mass
of
mankind
such
persons
should
remember
the
words
of
colton
that
and
sharp
as
our
wit
may
be
it
is
not
so
strong
as
the
memory
of
fools
nor
so
keen
as
their
resentment
he
that
has
strength
of
mind
to
forgive
is
by
no
means
weak
enough
to
forget
and
it
is
much
more
easy
to
do
a
cruel
thing
than
to
say
a
severe
one
oratorical
powers
many
of
the
most
effective
orators
of
all
ages
have
not
been
most
successful
in
long
and
formal
efforts
nor
have
they
always
been
close
and
ready
debaters
sudden
bursts
which
seemed
to
be
the
effect
of
inspiration
short
sentences
which
came
like
lightning
dazzling
burning
striking
down
everything
before
them
sentences
which
spoken
at
critical
moments
decided
the
fate
of
great
questions
sentences
which
at
once
became
proverbs
sentences
which
everybody
still
knows
by
heart
in
these
chiefly
lay
the
oratorical
power
of
mirabeau
and
chatham
patrick
henry
and
james
e
magoon
the
eloquence
of
otis
otis
was
naturally
elevated
in
thought
and
dwelt
with
greatest
delight
in
the
calm
contemplation
of
the
lofty
principles
which
should
govern
political
and
moral
conduct
and
yet
he
was
keenly
suspectible
to
excitement
his
intellect
explored
the
wilderness
of
the
universe
only
to
increase
the
discontent
of
those
noble
aspirations
of
his
soul
which
were
never
at
rest
in
early
manhood
he
was
a
close
student
but
as
he
advanced
in
age
he
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
public
action
as
ominous
storms
threatened
the
common
weal
he
found
less
delight
in
his
library
than
in
the
stern
strife
of
the
forum
as
he
prognosticated
the
coming
tempest
and
comprehended
its
fearful
issue
he
became
transformed
in
aspect
like
one
inspired
his
appearance
in
public
always
commanded
prompt
and
profound
attention
he
both
awed
and
delighted
the
multitudes
whom
his
bold
wisdom
so
opportunely
fortified
old
south
the
old
court
house
and
the
cradle
of
liberty
in
boston
were
familiar
with
his
eloquence
that
resounded
like
a
cheerful
clarion
in
days
that
tried
men
souls
it
was
then
that
his
great
heart
and
fervid
intellect
wrought
with
disinterested
and
noble
zeal
his
action
became
vehement
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
unutterable
fire
his
voice
distinct
melodious
swelling
and
increasing
in
height
and
depth
with
each
new
and
bolder
sentiment
filled
as
with
the
palpable
presence
of
a
deity
the
shaking
walls
the
listeners
became
rapt
and
impassioned
like
the
speaker
till
their
very
breath
forsook
them
he
poured
forth
a
flood
of
argument
and
passion
which
achieved
the
sublimes
earthly
good
and
happily
exemplified
the
description
which
percival
has
given
of
indignant
patriotism
expressed
in
eloquence
its
words
are
few
but
deep
and
solemn
and
they
break
fresh
from
the
fount
of
feeling
and
are
full
of
all
that
passion
which
on
carmel
fired
the
holy
prophet
when
his
lips
were
coals
the
language
winged
with
terror
as
when
bolts
leap
from
the
brooding
tempest
armed
with
wrath
commissioned
to
affright
us
and
e
magoon
otis
compared
with
american
orators
his
eloquence
like
that
of
his
distinguished
successors
was
marked
by
a
striking
individuality
it
did
not
partake
largely
of
the
placid
firmness
of
samuel
adams
or
of
the
intense
brilliancy
and
exquisite
taste
of
the
younger
quincy
or
the
subdued
and
elaborate
beauty
of
lee
or
the
philosophical
depth
of
john
adams
or
the
rugged
and
overwhelming
energy
of
patrick
henry
though
he
most
of
all
americans
resembled
the
e
magoon
otis
compared
with
english
orators
compared
with
english
orators
magoon
says
our
great
countryman
was
not
unlike
sheridan
in
natural
endowment
like
him
he
was
unequaled
in
impassioned
appeals
to
the
general
heart
of
mankind
he
swayed
all
by
his
electric
fire
charmed
the
timid
and
inspired
the
weak
subdued
the
haughty
and
enthralled
the
prejudiced
he
traversed
the
field
of
argument
and
invective
as
a
scythian
warrior
scours
the
plain
shooting
most
deadly
arrows
when
at
the
greatest
speed
he
rushed
into
forensic
battle
fearless
of
all
consequences
and
as
the
ancient
would
sometimes
set
its
axle
on
fire
by
the
rapidity
of
its
own
movement
so
would
the
ardent
soul
of
otis
become
ignited
and
fulminate
with
thought
as
he
swept
irresistibly
to
the
goal
when
aroused
by
some
great
crisis
his
eloquent
words
were
like
bolts
of
granite
heated
in
a
volcano
and
shot
forth
with
unerring
aim
crashing
where
they
fell
physical
appearance
in
respect
to
physical
ability
otis
was
happily
endowed
one
who
knew
him
well
has
recorded
that
he
was
finely
formed
and
had
an
intelligent
countenance
his
eye
voice
and
manner
were
very
impressive
the
elevation
of
his
mind
and
the
known
integrity
of
his
purposes
enabled
him
to
speak
with
decision
and
dignity
and
commanded
the
respect
as
well
as
the
admiration
of
his
audience
his
eloquence
showed
but
little
imagination
yet
it
was
instinct
with
the
fire
of
passion
it
may
be
not
unjustly
said
of
otis
as
of
judge
marshall
that
he
was
one
of
those
rare
beings
that
seem
to
be
sent
among
men
from
time
to
time
to
keep
alive
our
faith
in
humanity
he
had
a
wonderful
power
over
the
popular
feelings
but
he
employed
it
only
for
great
public
benefits
he
seems
to
have
said
to
himself
in
the
language
of
the
great
master
of
the
maxims
of
life
and
conduct
this
above
all
to
thine
own
self

true
and
it
must
follow

portrait
of

the
portrait
of
james

published
as
a
frontispiece
to
this
sketch
is
from
the
loaned
to
the
bostonian
society
by
harrison
gray
otis
of
winthrop
massachusetts
the
painting
from
which
it
is
taken
now
hanging
in
the
old
state
house
of
boston
is
a
reproduction
of
the
original
portrait
by
blackburn
to
whom
otis
sat
for
his
portrait
in
the
original
in
possession
of
rogers
a
descendant
of
james
otis
may
be
seen
at
her
residence
no
otis

boston
but
the
original
is
not
so
well
adapted
as
is
the
copy
to
photographic
reproduction
the
two
portraits
are
identical
in
feature
and
character
but
the
original
having
a
light
background
offends
the
camera
the
source
and
occasion
of
the
war
of
the
revolution
the
question
is
perhaps
more
curious
than
profitable
that
relates
to
the
source
and
occasion
of
the
first
of
that
series
of
events
which
produced
the
war
of
the
revolution
men
have
often
asked
what
was
its
original
cause
and
who
struck
the
first
blow
this
inquiry
was
well
answered
by
president
jefferson
in
a
letter
to
waterhouse
of
cambridge
written
march
suppose
it
would
be
difficult
to
trace
our
revolution
to
its
first
embryo
we
do
not
know
how
long
it
was
hatching
in
the
british
cabinet
before
they
ventured
to
make
the
first
of
the
experiments
which
were
to
develop
it
in
the
end
and
to
produce
complete
parliamentary
supremacy
you
mention
in
massachusetts
as
preceding
the
stamp
act
might
be
the
first
visible
symptoms
of
that
design
the
proposition
of
that
act
in
was
the
first
here
your
opposition
therefore
preceded
ours
as
occasion
was
sooner
given
there
than
here
and
the
truth
i
suppose
is
that
the
opposition
in
every
colony
began
whenever
the
encroachment
was
presented
to
it
question
of
priority
is
as
the
inquiry
would
be
who
first
of
the
three
hundred
spartans
offered
his
name
to
leonidas
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
justice
done
to
the
merits
of
all
in
the
primitive
opposition
made
by
otis
to
the
arbitrary
acts
of
trade
aided
by
the
writs
of
assistance
he
announced
two
maxims
which
lay
at
the
foundation
of
all
the
subsequent
war
one
was
that
without
representation
was
tyranny
the
other
expenditures
of
public
money
without
appropriations
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
were
arbitrary
and
therefore
unconstitutional
this
early
and
acute
sagacity
of
our
statesman
led
burke
finely
to
describe
the
political
feeling
in
america
as
follows
other
countries
the
people
more
simple
of
a
less
mercurial
cast
judge
of
an
ill
principle
in
government
only
by
an
actual
grievance
here
they
anticipate
the
evil
and
judge
of
the
pressure
of
the
grievance
by
the
badness
of
the
principle

a
distance

i
turned

george

the
boston
common

the
boston
common
schools
were
the
pride
of
the
town
they
were
most
jealously
guarded
and
were
opened
each
day
with
public
prayer
they
were
the
nurseries
of
a
true
democracy
in
them
the
men
who
played
the
most
important

in
the

received
their

and
the

breathed
their
bracing

england
and
america
i
have
already
dwelt
on
the
significance
of
the
way
in
which
the
pilgrim
fathers
driven
out
of
england
begin
this
compact
with
which
they
begin
their
life
in
this
new
world
with
warm
professions
of
allegiance
to
england
king
old
england
whose
king
and
bishops
drove
them
out
is
proud
of
them
and
counts
them
as
truly
her
children
as
shakespeare
and
milton
and
vane
as
the
american
walks
the
corridors
and
halls
of
the
parliament
house
at
westminster
he
pays
no
great
heed
to
the
painted
kings
upon
the
painted
windows
and
cares
little
for
the
gilded
throne
in
the
gilded
house
of
lords
the
speaker
chair
in
the
commons
does
not
stir
him
most
nor
the
white
form
of
hampden
that
stands
silent
at
the
door
but
his
heart
beats
fastest
where
among
great
scenes
from
english
triumphs
of
the
days
of
puritanism
and
the
revolution
he
sees
the
departure
of
the
pilgim
fathers
to
found
new
england
england
will
not
let
that
scene
go
as
a
part
of
american
history
only
but
claims
it
now
as
one
of
the
proudest
scenes
in
her
own
history
too
it
is
a
bud
of
promise
i
said
when
i
first
saw
it
there
shall
not
its
full
unfolding
be
some
great
reunion
of
the
english
race
a
prelude
to
the
federation
of
the
world
let
that
picture
there
in
the
parliament
house
at
westminster
stay
always
in
your
mind
to
remind
you
of
the
england
in
you
let
the
picture
of
the
signing
of
the
compact
on
the
mayflower
stay
with
it
to
remind
you
of
progress
and
greater
freedom
that
i

now
tempered

edwin
mead
the
universities
and
the
men
of
the
revolution
you
may
perhaps
remember
how
wendell
phillips
in
his
great
harvard
address
on
the
scholar
and
the
republic
reproached
some
men
of
learning
for
their
conservatism
and
timidity
their
backwardness
in
reform
and
it
is
true
that
conservatism
and
timidity
are
never
so
hateful
and
harmful
as
in
the
scholar
be
bold
be
bold
and
evermore
be
bold
those
words
which
emerson
liked
to
quote
are
words
which
should
ever
ring
in
the
ear
but
you
must
remember
that
roger
williams
and
sir
harry
vane
the
very
men
whom
wendell
phillips
named
as
two
men
deepest
in
thought
and
bravest
in
speech
of
all
who
spoke
english
in
their
day
came
the
one
from
cambridge
the
other
from
oxford
and
that
sam
adams
and
jefferson
the
two
men
whom
he
named
as
preeminent
in
the
early
days
of
the
republic
for
their
trust
in
the
people
were
the
sons
of
harvard
and
william
and
mary
john
adams
and
john
hancock
and
james
otis
and
joseph
warren
the
great
boston
leaders
in
the
revolution
were
all
harvard
men
like
samuel
adams
and
you
will
remember
how
many
of
the
great
virginians
were
like
jefferson
sons
of
william
and
mary
and
never
was
a
revolution
so
completely
led
by
scholars
as
the
great
puritan
revolution
which
planted
new
england
and
established
the
english
commonwealth
no
scholars
have
often
enough
been
cowards
and
trimmers
but
from
the
days
when
moses
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
brought
his
people
up
out
of
bondage
and
paul
who
had
sat
at
the
feet
of

christ
and

to
the
time
when
eliot

cromwell
and

and

all
scholars
of
oxford
and
cambridge
worked
for
english
commonwealth
to
the
time
of

of

was
born
in

barnstable
near
the

february
his
ancestors
were
of

the
founder
of
the

in
america
john
otis
came
from
hingham
in
norfolk
england
and
settled
in
hingham
massachusetts
in
the
year
his
grandson
john
otis
was
born
in
he
removed
from
hingham
to
barnstable
where
he
became
a
prominent
man
and
held
several
important
positions
for
eighteen
years
he
was

twenty
years
representative
for

member
of
the

for
thirteen
years
chief
justice
of

his
two
sons
john
and
james
became
distinguished
in
public
life
james
the
father
of
the
subject
of
this
sketch
was
an
eminent
lawyer
he
like
his
father
became
colonel
of
militia
chief
justice
of
common
pleas
and
judge
of
probate
james
otis
thus
by
inheritance
derived
his
legal
bent
and
love
for
political
life
his
mother
name
was
mary
allyne
or
alleyne
of
wethersfield
daughter
of
joseph
allyne
of
plymouth
she
was
connected
with
the
founders
of

the
mayflower
in
james
was
the
oldest
of
thirteen
children
several
of
whom
died
in
infancy
others
lived
to
attain
distinction
he
was
fitted
for
college
by
the
rev
jonathan
russell
of
barnstable
and
was
so
industrious
in
his
studies
that
he
was
ready
in
his
fifteenth
year
to
enter
as
a
freshman
at
harvard
in
june
there
is
grave
reason
for
believing
that
his
excessive
devotion
to
study
at
this
early
period
had
much
to
do
with
his
nervous
and
excitable
condition
in
succeeding
years
make
haste
slowly
is
the
translation
of
a
latin
motto
which
parents
and
teachers
ought
to
observe
in
the
education
of
children
far
better
is
it
for
the
student
to
take
time
in
making
a
thorough
preparation
for
the
great
work
of
life
than
to
rush
through
his
preparatory
course
at
the
great
risk
of
health
and
strength
let
him
aim

to
present
a

in
a
sound
body
james
otis
was
graduated
from
college
in
after
completing
a
four
years
successful
course
after
graduation
he
wisely
gave
nearly
two
years
to
the
pursuits
of
general
literature
and
science
before
entering
upon
the
law
in
this
he
set
a
good
example
to
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
who
are
so
strongly
tempted
to
enter
at
once
upon
professional
life
without
laying
a
broad
and
deep
foundation
for
future
usefulness
james
otis
was
very
fond
of
the
best
poets
and
in
the
zealous
emulation
of
their
beauties
says
magoon
he
energized
his
spirit
and
power
of
expression
he
did
not
merely
read
over
the
finest
passages
he
pondered
them
he
fused
them
into
his
own
soul
and
reproduced
their
charms
with
an
energy
all
his
own
in
he
entered
the
law
office
of
jeremiah
gridley
in
boston
who
was
then
one
of
the
most
distinguished
lawyers
in
the
country
he
began
the
practice
of
law
in
plymouth
in
but
soon
found
that
he
was
cabined
cribbed
and
confined
in
the
opportunity
to
rise
in
such
a
small
place
in
he
removed
to
boston
and
there
finding
full
scope
for
his
powers
soon
rose
to
the
foremost
rank
in
his
profession
he
justly
won
the
high
place
so
generally
accorded
him
by
his
learning
his
integrity
and
his
marvelous
eloquence
in
acting
successfully
as
counsel
for
the
three
men
who
were
accused
of
piracy
in
halifax
he
received
a
well
earned
fee
which
was
the
largest
that
had
ever
been
paid
to
a
massachusetts
lawyer
like
james
garfield
he
kept
up
a
lively
interest
in
classical
studies
during
his
entire
professional
career
james
otis
married
miss
ruth
cunningham
daughter
of
a
boston
merchant
early
in
the
marriage
was
not
in
all
respects
a
happy
one
partly
on
account
of
political
differences
while
he
became
an
ardent
patriot
she
remained
a
staunch
loyalist
until
her
death
on
another
reason
for
the
want
of
complete
domestic
felicity
was
the
peculiar
character
of
his
genius
which
so
often
glowing
excitable
and
irregular
must
have
frequently
demanded
a
home
forbearance
almost
miraculous

and
ended

days
in

the
younger
daughter
mary
married
benjamin
the
eldest
son
of
the
distinguished
general
lincoln
in
when
he
was
years
of
age
his
great
political
career
began
by
his
determined
opposition
to
the
writs
of
assistance
he
said
with
an
eloquence
that
thrilled
every
heart
a
house
is
his
castle
and
while
he
is
quiet
he
is
as
well
guarded
as
a
prince
in
his
castle
this
writ
if
it
should
be
declared
legal
would
totally
annihilate
this
privilege
i
am
determined
to
sacrifice
estate
ease
health
applause
and
even
life
to
the
sacred
calls
of
my
country
in
opposition
to
a
kind
of
power
the
exercise
of
which
cost
one
king
his
head
and
another
his
throne
in
he
published
a
pamphlet
entitled
the
rights
of
the
colonies
vindicated
which
attracted
great
attention
in
england
for
its
finished
diction
and
masterly
arguments
in
this
production
he
firmly
took
the
unassailable
position
that
in
all
questions
relating
to
the
expenditure
of
public
money
the
rights
of
a
colonial
legislature
were
as
sacred
as
the
rights
of
the
house
of
commons
some
of
the
parliamentary
leaders
in
england
spoke
of
the
work
with
contempt
lord
mansfield
the
great
english
legal
luminary
who
had
carefully
read
it
rebuked
them
for
their
attitude
towards
it
but
they
rejoined
as
quoted
by
bancroft
the
man
is
mad
what
then
answered
mansfield
one
mad
man
often
makes
many
massaniello
was
mad
nobody
doubted
it
yet
for
all
that
he
overturned
the
government
of
naples
in
june
otis
proposed
the
calling
of
a
congress
of
delegates
from
all
the
colonies
to
consider
the
stamp
act
in
that
famous
congress
which
met
in
october
in
new
york
he
was
one
of
the
delegates
and
was
appointed
on
the
committee
to
prepare
an
address
to
the
commons
of
england
in
he
was
elected
speaker
of
the
massachusetts
assembly
governor
bernard
took
a
decidedly
negative
position
against
the
fiery
orator
whom
he
feared
as
much
as
he
did
the
intrepid
sam
adams
but
bernard
could
not
put
a
padlock
upon
the
lips
of
otis
when
the
king
who
was
greatly
offended
at
the
circular
letter
to
the
colonies
which
requested
them
to
unite
in
measures
for
redress
demanded
of
bernard
to
dismiss
the
assembly
unless
it
should
rescind
its
action
otis
made
a
flaming
speech
his
adversaries
said
it
was
the
most
violent
abusive
and
treasonable
declaration
that
perhaps
was
ever
uttered
in
the
debate
which
ensued
upon
this
royal
order
otis
said
we
are
asked
to
rescind
are
we
let
great
britain
rescind
her
measures
or
the
colonies
are
lost
to
her
forever
otis
carried
the
house
triumphantly
with
him
and
it
refused
to
rescind
by
a
vote
of
to
seventeen
in
the
summer
of
he
attacked
some
of
the
revenue
officers
in
an
article
in
the
boston
gazette
a
few
evenings
afterwards
while
sitting
in
the
british
in
boston
he
was
savagely
assaulted
by
a
man
named
robinson
who
struck
him
on
the
head
with
a
heavy
cane
or
sword
the
severe
wound
which
was
produced
so
greatly
aggravated
the
mental
disease
which
had
before
been
somewhat
apparent
that
his
reason
rapidly
forsook
him
otis
obtained
a
judgment
of
against
robinson
for
the
attack
but
when
the
penitent
officer
made
a
written
apology
for
his
irreparable
offense
the
sufferer
refused
to
take
a
penny
in
he
was
elected
to
the
legislature
and
sometimes
afterward
appeared
in
court
and
in
the
town
meeting
but
found
himself
unable
to
take
part
in
public
business
in
june
while
living
in
a
state
of
harmless
insanity
with
his
sister
mercy
warren
at
watertown
he
heard
according
to
appleton
cyclopedia
of
american
biography
the
rumor
of
battle
on
the
he
slipped
away
unobserved
borrowed
a
musket
from
some
farmhouse
by
the
roadside
and
joined
the
minute
men
who
were
marching
to
the
aid
of
the
troops
on
bunker
hill
he
took
an
active
part
in
that
battle
and
after
it
was
over
made
his
way
home
again
after
midnight
the
last
years
of
his
life
were
spent
at
the
residence
of
osgood
in
andover
for
a
brief
season
it
seemed
as
though
his
reason
was
restored
he
even
undertook
a
case
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
boston
but
found
himself
unequal
to
the
exertion
demanded
of
him
he
had
been
persuaded
to
dine
with
governor
hancock
and
some
other
friends
but
the
presence
of
his
former
friends
and
the
revived
memories
of
previous
events
gave
a
great
shock
to
his
broken
mind
he
was
persuaded
to
go
back
at
once
to
the
residence
of
osgood
after
his
mind
had
become
unsettled
he
said
to
warren
my
dear
sister
i
hope
when
god
almighty
in
his
righteous
providence
shall
take
me
out
of
time
into
eternity
that
it
will
be
by
a
flash
of
lightning
and
this
wish
he
often
repeated
six
weeks
exactly
after
his
return
on
may
while
standing
in
the
side
doorway
during
a
with
his
cane
in
his
hand
and
telling
the
assembled
family
a
story
he
was
struck
by
lightning
and
instantly
killed
not
one
of
the
seven
or
eight
persons
in
the
room
was
injured
no
mark
of
any
kind
could
be
found
on
otis
nor
was
there
the
slightest
change
or
convulsion
on
his
features
his
remains
were
brought
to
boston
and
interred
in
the
granary
burying
ground
with
every
mark
of
respect
a
great
number
of
the
citizens
attending
his
funeral
james
otis
sowed
the
seeds
of
liberty
in
this
new
world
without
living
to
see
the
harvest
and
probably
without
ever
dreaming
what
magnificent
crops
would
be
produced
when
the
usurpations
of
parliamentarians
and
their
allies
at
home
became
as
burdensome
as
they
were
unjust
he
defended
his
countrymen
in
whose
veins
flowed
the
best
of
english
blood
with
an
eloquence
whose
ultimate
influence
transcended
his
own
sublime
aspirations
