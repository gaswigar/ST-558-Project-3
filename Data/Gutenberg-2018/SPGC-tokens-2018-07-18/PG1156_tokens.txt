chapter
i
the
towers
of
zenith
aspired
above
the
morning
mist
austere
towers
of
steel
and
cement
and
limestone
sturdy
as
cliffs
and
delicate
as
silver
rods
they
were
neither
citadels
nor
churches
but
frankly
and
beautifully
the
mist
took
pity
on
the
fretted
structures
of
earlier
generations
the
post
office
with
its
mansard
the
red
brick
minarets
of
hulking
old
houses
factories
with
stingy
and
sooted
windows
wooden
tenements
colored
like
mud
the
city
was
full
of
such
grotesqueries
but
the
clean
towers
were
thrusting
them
from
the
business
center
and
on
the
farther
hills
were
shining
new
houses
homes
they
seemed
for
laughter
and
tranquillity
over
a
concrete
bridge
fled
a
limousine
of
long
sleek
hood
and
noiseless
engine
these
people
in
evening
clothes
were
returning
from
an
rehearsal
of
a
little
theater
play
an
artistic
adventure
considerably
illuminated
by
champagne
below
the
bridge
curved
a
railroad
a
maze
of
green
and
crimson
lights
the
new
york
flyer
boomed
past
and
twenty
lines
of
polished
steel
leaped
into
the
glare
in
one
of
the
skyscrapers
the
wires
of
the
associated
press
were
closing
down
the
telegraph
operators
wearily
raised
their
celluloid
after
a
night
of
talking
with
paris
and
peking
through
the
building
crawled
the
scrubwomen
yawning
their
old
shoes
slapping
the
dawn
mist
spun
away
cues
of
men
with
clumped
toward
the
immensity
of
new
factories
sheets
of
glass
and
hollow
tile
glittering
shops
where
five
thousand
men
worked
beneath
one
roof
pouring
out
the
honest
wares
that
would
be
sold
up
the
euphrates
and
across
the
veldt
the
whistles
rolled
out
in
greeting
a
chorus
cheerful
as
the
april
dawn
the
song
of
labor
in
a
city
built
it
seemed
for
giants
ii
there
was
nothing
of
the
giant
in
the
aspect
of
the
man
who
was
beginning
to
awaken
on
the
of
a
dutch
colonial
house
in
that
residential
district
of
zenith
known
as
floral
heights
his
name
was
george
babbitt
he
was
years
old
now
in
april
and
he
made
nothing
in
particular
neither
butter
nor
shoes
nor
poetry
but
he
was
nimble
in
the
calling
of
selling
houses
for
more
than
people
could
afford
to
pay
his
large
head
was
pink
his
brown
hair
thin
and
dry
his
face
was
babyish
in
slumber
despite
his
wrinkles
and
the
red
on
the
slopes
of
his
nose
he
was
not
fat
but
he
was
exceedingly
well
fed
his
cheeks
were
pads
and
the
unroughened
hand
which
lay
helpless
upon
the
blanket
was
slightly
puffy
he
seemed
prosperous
extremely
married
and
unromantic
and
altogether
unromantic
appeared
this
which
looked
on
one
sizable
elm
two
respectable
a
cement
driveway
and
a
corrugated
iron
garage
yet
babbitt
was
again
dreaming
of
the
fairy
child
a
dream
more
romantic
than
scarlet
pagodas
by
a
silver
sea
for
years
the
fairy
child
had
come
to
him
where
others
saw
but
georgie
babbitt
she
discerned
gallant
youth
she
waited
for
him
in
the
darkness
beyond
mysterious
groves
when
at
last
he
could
slip
away
from
the
crowded
house
he
darted
to
her
his
wife
his
clamoring
friends
sought
to
follow
but
he
escaped
the
girl
fleet
beside
him
and
they
crouched
together
on
a
shadowy
hillside
she
was
so
slim
so
white
so
eager
she
cried
that
he
was
gay
and
valiant
that
she
would
wait
for
him
that
they
would
sail
rumble
and
bang
of
the
babbitt
moaned
turned
over
struggled
back
toward
his
dream
he
could
see
only
her
face
now
beyond
misty
waters
the
slammed
the
basement
door
a
dog
barked
in
the
next
yard
as
babbitt
sank
blissfully
into
a
dim
warm
tide
the
went
by
whistling
and
the
advocate
thumped
the
front
door
babbitt
roused
his
stomach
constricted
with
alarm
as
he
relaxed
he
was
pierced
by
the
familiar
and
irritating
rattle
of
some
one
cranking
a
ford
himself
a
pious
motorist
babbitt
cranked
with
the
unseen
driver
with
him
waited
through
taut
hours
for
the
roar
of
the
starting
engine
with
him
agonized
as
the
roar
ceased
and
again
began
the
infernal
patient
a
round
flat
sound
a
shivering
sound
a
sound
infuriating
and
inescapable
not
till
the
rising
voice
of
the
motor
told
him
that
the
ford
was
moving
was
he
released
from
the
panting
tension
he
glanced
once
at
his
favorite
tree
elm
twigs
against
the
gold
patina
of
sky
and
fumbled
for
sleep
as
for
a
drug
he
who
had
been
a
boy
very
credulous
of
life
was
no
longer
greatly
interested
in
the
possible
and
improbable
adventures
of
each
new
day
he
escaped
from
reality
till
the
rang
at
iii
it
was
the
best
of
nationally
advertised
and
quantitatively
produced
with
all
modern
attachments
including
cathedral
chime
intermittent
alarm
and
a
phosphorescent
dial
babbitt
was
proud
of
being
awakened
by
such
a
rich
device
socially
it
was
almost
as
creditable
as
buying
expensive
cord
tires
he
sulkily
admitted
now
that
there
was
no
more
escape
but
he
lay
and
detested
the
grind
of
the
business
and
disliked
his
family
and
disliked
himself
for
disliking
them
the
evening
before
he
had
played
poker
at
vergil
gunch
till
midnight
and
after
such
holidays
he
was
irritable
before
breakfast
it
may
have
been
the
tremendous
beer
of
the
and
the
cigars
to
which
that
beer
enticed
him
it
may
have
been
resentment
of
return
from
this
fine
bold
to
a
restricted
region
of
wives
and
stenographers
and
of
suggestions
not
to
smoke
so
much
from
the
bedroom
beside
the
his
wife
detestably
cheerful
time
to
get
up
georgie
boy
and
the
itchy
sound
the
brisk
and
scratchy
sound
of
combing
hairs
out
of
a
stiff
brush
he
grunted
he
dragged
his
thick
legs
in
faded
pajamas
from
under
the
khaki
blanket
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
running
his
fingers
through
his
wild
hair
while
his
plump
feet
mechanically
felt
for
his
slippers
he
looked
regretfully
at
the
blanket
forever
a
suggestion
to
him
of
freedom
and
heroism
he
had
bought
it
for
a
camping
trip
which
had
never
come
off
it
symbolized
gorgeous
loafing
gorgeous
cursing
virile
flannel
shirts
he
creaked
to
his
feet
groaning
at
the
waves
of
pain
which
passed
behind
his
eyeballs
though
he
waited
for
their
scorching
recurrence
he
looked
blurrily
out
at
the
yard
it
delighted
him
as
always
it
was
the
neat
yard
of
a
successful
business
man
of
zenith
that
is
it
was
perfection
and
made
him
also
perfect
he
regarded
the
corrugated
iron
garage
for
the
time
in
a
year
he
reflected
no
class
to
that
tin
shack
have
to
build
me
a
frame
garage
but
by
golly
it
the
only
thing
on
the
place
that
is
while
he
stared
he
thought
of
a
community
garage
for
his
acreage
development
glen
oriole
he
stopped
puffing
and
jiggling
his
arms
were
akimbo
his
petulant
face
was
set
in
harder
lines
he
suddenly
seemed
capable
an
official
a
man
to
contrive
to
direct
to
get
things
done
on
the
vigor
of
his
idea
he
was
carried
down
the
hard
clean
hall
into
the
bathroom
though
the
house
was
not
large
it
had
like
all
houses
on
floral
heights
an
altogether
royal
bathroom
of
porcelain
and
glazed
tile
and
metal
sleek
as
silver
the
was
a
rod
of
clear
glass
set
in
nickel
the
tub
was
long
enough
for
a
prussian
guard
and
above
the
set
bowl
was
a
sensational
exhibit
of
holder
holder
and
so
glittering
and
so
ingenious
that
they
resembled
an
electrical
but
the
babbitt
whose
god
was
modern
appliances
was
not
pleased
the
air
of
the
bathroom
was
thick
with
the
smell
of
a
heathen
toothpaste
verona
been
at
it
again
of
sticking
to
lilidol
like
i
asked
her
she
gone
and
gotten
some
confounded
stinkum
stuff
that
makes
you
sick
the
was
wrinkled
and
the
floor
was
wet
his
daughter
verona
eccentrically
took
baths
in
the
morning
now
and
then
he
slipped
on
the
mat
and
slid
against
the
tub
he
said
damn
furiously
he
snatched
up
his
tube
of
furiously
he
lathered
with
a
belligerent
slapping
of
the
unctuous
brush
furiously
he
raked
his
plump
cheeks
with
a
it
pulled
the
blade
was
dull
he
said
damn
oh
oh
damn
it
he
hunted
through
the
for
a
packet
of
new
reflecting
as
invariably
be
cheaper
to
buy
one
of
these
dinguses
and
strop
your
own
blades
and
when
he
discovered
the
packet
behind
the
round
box
of
bicarbonate
of
soda
he
thought
ill
of
his
wife
for
putting
it
there
and
very
well
of
himself
for
not
saying
but
he
did
say
it
immediately
afterward
when
with
wet
and
fingers
he
tried
to
remove
the
horrible
little
envelope
and
crisp
clinging
oiled
paper
from
the
new
blade
then
there
was
the
problem
never
solved
of
what
to
do
with
the
old
blade
which
might
imperil
the
fingers
of
his
young
as
usual
he
tossed
it
on
top
of
the
with
a
mental
note
that
some
day
he
must
remove
the
fifty
or
sixty
other
blades
that
were
also
temporarily
piled
up
there
he
finished
his
shaving
in
a
growing
testiness
increased
by
his
spinning
headache
and
by
the
emptiness
in
his
stomach
when
he
was
done
his
round
face
smooth
and
streamy
and
his
eyes
stinging
from
soapy
water
he
reached
for
a
towel
the
family
towels
were
wet
wet
and
clammy
and
vile
all
of
them
wet
he
found
as
he
blindly
snatched
them
his
own
his
wife
verona
ted
tinka
and
the
lone
with
the
huge
welt
of
initial
then
george
babbitt
did
a
dismaying
thing
he
wiped
his
face
on
the
it
was
a
trifle
which
always
hung
there
to
indicate
that
the
babbitts
were
in
the
best
floral
heights
society
no
one
had
ever
used
it
no
guest
had
ever
dared
to
guests
secretively
took
a
corner
of
the
nearest
regular
towel
he
was
raging
by
golly
here
they
go
and
use
up
all
the
towels
every
doggone
one
of
and
they
use
and
get
all
wet
and
sopping
and
never
put
out
a
dry
one
for
me
of
course
i
the
goat
and
then
i
want
one
and
i
the
only
person
in
the
doggone
house
that
got
the
slightest
doggone
bit
of
consideration
for
other
people
and
thoughtfulness
and
consider
there
may
be
others
that
may
want
to
use
the
doggone
bathroom
after
me
and
consider
he
was
pitching
the
chill
abominations
into
the
pleased
by
the
vindictiveness
of
that
desolate
flapping
sound
and
in
the
midst
his
wife
serenely
trotted
in
observed
serenely
why
georgie
dear
what
are
you
doing
are
you
going
to
wash
out
the
towels
why
you
need
wash
out
the
towels
oh
georgie
you
did
go
and
use
the
did
you
it
is
not
recorded
that
he
was
able
to
answer
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
he
was
sufficiently
roused
by
his
wife
to
look
at
her
iv
myra
babbitt
george
babbitt
was
definitely
mature
she
had
creases
from
the
corners
of
her
mouth
to
the
bottom
of
her
chin
and
her
plump
neck
bagged
but
the
thing
that
marked
her
as
having
passed
the
line
was
that
she
no
longer
had
reticences
before
her
husband
and
no
longer
worried
about
not
having
reticences
she
was
in
a
petticoat
now
and
corsets
which
bulged
and
unaware
of
being
seen
in
bulgy
corsets
she
had
become
so
dully
habituated
to
married
life
that
in
her
full
matronliness
she
was
as
sexless
as
an
anemic
nun
she
was
a
good
woman
a
kind
woman
a
diligent
woman
but
no
one
save
perhaps
tinka
her
was
at
all
interested
in
her
or
entirely
aware
that
she
was
alive
after
a
rather
thorough
discussion
of
all
the
domestic
and
social
aspects
of
towels
she
apologized
to
babbitt
for
his
having
an
alcoholic
headache
and
he
recovered
enough
to
endure
the
search
for
a
undershirt
which
had
he
pointed
out
malevolently
been
concealed
among
his
clean
pajamas
he
was
fairly
amiable
in
the
conference
on
the
brown
suit
what
do
you
think
myra
he
pawed
at
the
clothes
hunched
on
a
chair
in
their
bedroom
while
she
moved
about
mysteriously
adjusting
and
patting
her
petticoat
and
to
his
jaundiced
eye
never
seeming
to
get
on
with
her
dressing
how
about
it
shall
i
wear
the
brown
suit
another
day
well
it
looks
awfully
nice
on
i
know
but
gosh
it
needs
that
so
perhaps
it
it
certainly
could
stand
being
pressed
all
yes
perhaps
it
would
hurt
it
to
be
but
gee
the
coat
does
need
pressing
no
sense
in
having
the
whole
darn
suit
pressed
when
the
coat
does
need
that
but
the
pants
certainly
need
it
all
right
look
at
them
look
at
those
wrinkles
the
pants
certainly
do
need
that
so
oh
georgie
why
could
you
wear
the
brown
coat
with
the
blue
trousers
we
were
wondering
what
we
do
with
them
good
lord
did
you
ever
in
all
my
life
know
me
to
wear
the
coat
of
one
suit
and
the
pants
of
another
what
do
you
think
i
am
a
busted
bookkeeper
well
why
do
you
put
on
the
dark
gray
suit
and
stop
in
at
the
tailor
and
leave
the
brown
trousers
well
they
certainly
need
now
where
the
devil
is
that
gray
suit
oh
yes
here
we
he
was
able
to
get
through
the
other
crises
of
dressing
with
comparative
resoluteness
and
calm
his
first
adornment
was
the
sleeveless
dimity
undershirt
in
which
he
resembled
a
small
boy
humorlessly
wearing
a
cheesecloth
tabard
at
a
civic
pageant
he
never
put
on
without
thanking
the
god
of
progress
that
he
did
wear
tight
long
undergarments
like
his
and
partner
henry
thompson
his
second
embellishment
was
combing
and
slicking
back
his
hair
it
gave
him
a
tremendous
forehead
arching
up
two
inches
beyond
the
former
but
most
of
all
was
the
donning
of
his
spectacles
there
is
character
in
spectacles
the
pretentious
tortoiseshell
the
meek
of
the
school
teacher
the
twisted
glasses
of
the
old
villager
babbitt
spectacles
had
huge
circular
frameless
lenses
of
the
very
best
glass
the
were
thin
bars
of
gold
in
them
he
was
the
modern
business
man
one
who
gave
orders
to
clerks
and
drove
a
car
and
played
occasional
golf
and
was
scholarly
in
regard
to
salesmanship
his
head
suddenly
appeared
not
babyish
but
weighty
and
you
noted
his
heavy
blunt
nose
his
straight
mouth
and
thick
long
upper
lip
his
chin
overfleshy
but
strong
with
respect
you
beheld
him
put
on
the
rest
of
his
uniform
as
a
solid
citizen
the
gray
suit
was
well
cut
well
made
and
completely
undistinguished
it
was
a
standard
suit
white
piping
on
the
v
of
the
vest
added
a
flavor
of
law
and
learning
his
shoes
were
black
laced
boots
good
boots
honest
boots
standard
boots
extraordinarily
uninteresting
boots
the
only
frivolity
was
in
his
purple
knitted
scarf
with
considerable
comment
on
the
matter
to
babbitt
who
acrobatically
fastening
the
back
of
her
blouse
to
her
skirt
with
a
did
not
hear
a
word
he
said
he
chose
between
the
purple
scarf
and
a
tapestry
effect
with
stringless
brown
harps
among
blown
palms
and
into
it
he
thrust
a
pin
with
opal
eyes
a
sensational
event
was
changing
from
the
brown
suit
to
the
gray
the
contents
of
his
pockets
he
was
earnest
about
these
objects
they
were
of
eternal
importance
like
baseball
or
the
republican
party
they
included
a
fountain
pen
and
a
silver
pencil
always
lacking
a
supply
of
new
leads
which
belonged
in
the
righthand
upper
vest
pocket
without
them
he
would
have
felt
naked
on
his
were
a
gold
penknife
silver
seven
keys
the
use
of
two
of
which
he
had
forgotten
and
incidentally
a
good
watch
depending
from
the
chain
was
a
large
yellowish
of
his
membership
in
the
brotherly
and
protective
order
of
elks
most
significant
of
all
was
his
pocket
that
modern
and
efficient
which
contained
the
addresses
of
people
whom
he
had
forgotten
prudent
memoranda
of
postal
which
had
reached
their
destinations
months
ago
stamps
which
had
lost
their
mucilage
clippings
of
verses
by
cholmondeley
frink
and
of
the
newspaper
editorials
from
which
babbitt
got
his
opinions
and
his
polysyllables
notes
to
be
sure
and
do
things
which
he
did
not
intend
to
do
and
one
curious
inscription
but
he
had
no
no
one
had
ever
happened
to
give
him
one
so
he
had
the
habit
and
people
who
carried
he
regarded
as
effeminate
last
he
stuck
in
his
lapel
the
boosters
club
button
with
the
conciseness
of
great
art
the
button
displayed
two
words
it
made
babbitt
feel
loyal
and
important
it
associated
him
with
good
fellows
with
men
who
were
nice
and
human
and
important
in
business
circles
it
was
his
his
legion
of
honor
ribbon
his
phi
beta
kappa
key
with
the
subtleties
of
dressing
ran
other
complex
worries
i
feel
kind
of
punk
this
morning
he
said
i
think
i
had
too
much
dinner
last
evening
you
ought
to
serve
those
heavy
banana
but
you
asked
me
to
have
i
know
but
i
tell
you
when
a
fellow
gets
past
forty
he
has
to
look
after
his
digestion
there
a
lot
of
fellows
that
do
take
proper
care
of
themselves
i
tell
you
at
forty
a
man
a
fool
or
his
doctor
i
mean
his
own
doctor
folks
do
give
enough
attention
to
this
matter
of
dieting
now
i
think
course
a
man
ought
to
have
a
good
meal
after
the
day
work
but
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
both
of
us
if
we
took
lighter
but
georgie
here
at
home
i
always
do
have
a
light
mean
to
imply
i
make
a
hog
of
myself
eating
yes
sure
you
have
a
swell
time
if
you
had
to
eat
the
truck
that
new
steward
hands
out
to
us
at
the
athletic
club
but
i
certainly
do
feel
out
of
sorts
this
morning
funny
got
a
pain
down
here
on
the
left
side
but
no
that
would
be
appendicitis
would
it
last
night
when
i
was
driving
over
to
verg
gunch
i
felt
a
pain
in
my
stomach
too
right
here
it
was
kind
of
a
sharp
shooting
pain
i
where
that
dime
go
to
why
do
you
serve
more
prunes
at
breakfast
of
course
i
eat
an
apple
every
evening
an
apple
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
but
still
you
ought
to
have
more
prunes
and
not
all
these
fancy
the
last
time
i
had
prunes
you
did
eat
well
i
did
feel
like
eating
i
suppose
matter
of
fact
i
think
i
did
eat
some
of
anyway
i
tell
you
it
mighty
important
to
i
was
saying
to
verg
gunch
just
last
evening
most
people
do
take
sufficient
care
of
their
diges
shall
we
have
the
gunches
for
our
dinner
next
week
why
sure
you
now
see
here
george
i
want
you
to
put
on
your
nice
that
rats
the
rest
of
wo
want
to
of
course
they
will
you
remember
when
you
did
dress
for
the
littlefields
and
all
the
rest
did
and
how
embarrassed
you
embarrassed
hell
i
was
embarrassed
everybody
knows
i
can
put
on
as
expensive
a
tux
as
anybody
else
and
i
should
worry
if
i
happen
to
have
it
on
sometimes
all
a
darn
nuisance
anyway
all
right
for
a
woman
that
stays
around
the
house
all
the
time
but
when
a
fellow
worked
like
the
dickens
all
day
he
does
want
to
go
and
hustle
his
head
off
getting
into
the
for
a
lot
of
folks
that
he
seen
in
just
ordinary
clothes
that
same
you
know
you
enjoy
being
seen
in
one
the
other
evening
you
admitted
you
were
glad
i
insisted
on
your
dressing
you
said
you
felt
a
lot
better
for
it
and
oh
georgie
i
do
wish
you
would
say
rats
what
the
odds
well
it
what
all
the
nice
folks
say
suppose
lucile
mckelvey
heard
you
calling
it
a
well
that
all
right
now
lucile
mckelvey
ca
pull
anything
on
me
her
folks
are
common
as
mud
even
if
her
husband
and
her
dad
are
millionaires
i
suppose
you
trying
to
rub
in
your
exalted
social
position
well
let
me
tell
you
that
your
revered
paternal
ancestor
henry
does
even
call
it
a
he
calls
it
a
jacket
for
a
ringtail
monkey
and
you
could
get
him
into
one
unless
you
chloroformed
him
now
do
be
horrid
well
i
do
want
to
be
horrid
but
lord
you
getting
as
fussy
as
verona
ever
since
she
got
out
of
college
she
been
too
rambunctious
to
live
with
does
know
what
she
wants
well
i
know
what
she
wants
all
she
wants
is
to
marry
a
millionaire
and
live
in
europe
and
hold
some
preacher
hand
and
simultaneously
at
the
same
time
stay
right
here
in
zenith
and
be
some
blooming
kind
of
a
socialist
agitator
or
boss
or
some
damn
thing
lord
and
ted
is
just
as
bad
he
wants
to
go
to
college
and
he
does
want
to
go
to
college
only
one
of
the
three
that
knows
her
own
mind
is
tinka
simply
understand
how
i
ever
came
to
have
a
pair
of
shillyshallying
children
like
rone
and
ted
i
may
not
be
any
rockefeller
or
james
shakespeare
but
i
certainly
do
know
my
own
mind
and
i
do
keep
right
on
plugging
along
in
the
office
and
do
you
know
the
latest
far
as
i
can
figure
out
ted
new
bee
is
he
like
to
be
a
movie
actor
and
and
here
told
him
a
hundred
times
if
he
go
to
college
and
and
make
good
i
set
him
up
in
business
and
verona
just
exactly
as
bad
does
know
what
she
wants
well
well
come
on
are
you
ready
yet
the
girl
rang
the
bell
three
minutes
v
before
he
followed
his
wife
babbitt
stood
at
the
westernmost
window
of
their
room
this
residential
settlement
floral
heights
was
on
a
rise
and
though
the
center
of
the
city
was
three
miles
away
zenith
had
between
three
and
four
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
now
he
could
see
the
top
of
the
second
national
tower
an
indiana
limestone
building
of
stories
its
shining
walls
rose
against
april
sky
to
a
simple
cornice
like
a
streak
of
white
fire
integrity
was
in
the
tower
and
decision
it
bore
its
strength
lightly
as
a
tall
soldier
as
babbitt
stared
the
nervousness
was
soothed
from
his
face
his
slack
chin
lifted
in
reverence
all
he
articulated
was
that
one
lovely
sight
but
he
was
inspired
by
the
rhythm
of
the
city
his
love
of
it
renewed
he
beheld
the
tower
as
a
of
the
religion
of
business
a
faith
passionate
exalted
surpassing
common
men
and
as
he
clumped
down
to
breakfast
he
whistled
the
ballad
oh
by
gee
by
gosh
by
jingo
as
though
it
were
a
hymn
melancholy
and
noble
chapter
ii
relieved
of
babbitt
bumbling
and
the
soft
grunts
with
which
his
wife
expressed
the
sympathy
she
was
too
experienced
to
feel
and
much
too
experienced
not
to
show
their
bedroom
settled
instantly
into
impersonality
it
gave
on
the
it
served
both
of
them
as
and
on
the
coldest
nights
babbitt
luxuriously
gave
up
the
duty
of
being
manly
and
retreated
to
the
bed
inside
to
curl
his
toes
in
the
warmth
and
laugh
at
the
january
gale
the
room
displayed
a
modest
and
pleasant
after
one
of
the
best
standard
designs
of
the
decorator
who
did
the
interiors
for
most
of
the
houses
in
zenith
the
walls
were
gray
the
woodwork
white
the
rug
a
serene
blue
and
very
much
like
mahogany
was
the
furniture
the
bureau
with
its
great
clear
mirror
with
of
almost
solid
silver
the
plain
twin
beds
between
them
a
small
table
holding
a
standard
electric
bedside
lamp
a
glass
for
water
and
a
standard
bedside
book
with
colored
illustrations
what
particular
book
it
was
can
not
be
ascertained
since
no
one
had
ever
opened
it
the
mattresses
were
firm
but
not
hard
triumphant
modern
mattresses
which
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
the
radiator
was
of
exactly
the
proper
scientific
surface
for
the
cubic
contents
of
the
room
the
windows
were
large
and
easily
opened
with
the
best
catches
and
cords
and
holland
guaranteed
not
to
crack
it
was
a
masterpiece
among
bedrooms
right
out
of
cheerful
modern
houses
for
medium
incomes
only
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
babbitts
nor
with
any
one
else
if
people
had
ever
lived
and
loved
here
read
thrillers
at
midnight
and
lain
in
beautiful
indolence
on
a
sunday
morning
there
were
no
signs
of
it
it
had
the
air
of
being
a
very
good
room
in
a
very
good
hotel
one
expected
the
chambermaid
to
come
in
and
make
it
ready
for
people
who
would
stay
but
one
night
go
without
looking
back
and
never
think
of
it
again
every
second
house
in
floral
heights
had
a
bedroom
precisely
like
this
the
babbitts
house
was
five
years
old
it
was
all
as
competent
and
glossy
as
this
bedroom
it
had
the
best
of
taste
the
best
of
inexpensive
rugs
a
simple
and
laudable
architecture
and
the
latest
conveniences
throughout
electricity
took
the
place
of
candles
and
slatternly
along
the
bedroom
baseboard
were
three
plugs
for
electric
lamps
concealed
by
little
brass
doors
in
the
halls
were
plugs
for
the
vacuum
cleaner
and
in
the
plugs
for
the
piano
lamp
for
the
electric
fan
the
trim
with
its
admirable
oak
buffet
its
cupboard
its
creamy
plaster
walls
its
modest
scene
of
a
salmon
expiring
upon
a
pile
of
oysters
had
plugs
which
supplied
the
electric
percolator
and
the
electric
toaster
in
fact
there
was
but
one
thing
wrong
with
the
babbitt
house
it
was
not
a
home
ii
often
of
a
morning
babbitt
came
bouncing
and
jesting
in
to
breakfast
but
things
were
mysteriously
awry
as
he
pontifically
tread
the
upper
hall
he
looked
into
verona
bedroom
and
protested
what
the
use
of
giving
the
family
a
house
when
they
do
appreciate
it
and
tend
to
business
and
get
down
to
brass
tacks
he
marched
upon
them
verona
a
dumpy
girl
of
just
out
of
bryn
mawr
given
to
solicitudes
about
duty
and
sex
and
god
and
the
unconquerable
bagginess
of
the
gray
she
was
now
wearing
ted
theodore
roosevelt
babbitt
a
decorative
boy
of
seventeen
tinka
katherine
still
a
baby
at
ten
with
radiant
red
hair
and
a
thin
skin
which
hinted
of
too
much
candy
and
too
many
ice
cream
sodas
babbitt
did
not
show
his
vague
irritation
as
he
tramped
in
he
really
disliked
being
a
family
tyrant
and
his
nagging
was
as
meaningless
as
it
was
frequent
he
shouted
at
tinka
well
kittiedoolie
it
was
the
only
pet
name
in
his
vocabulary
except
the
dear
and
with
which
he
recognized
his
wife
and
he
flung
it
at
tinka
every
morning
he
gulped
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
hope
of
pacifying
his
stomach
and
his
soul
his
stomach
ceased
to
feel
as
though
it
did
not
belong
to
him
but
verona
began
to
be
conscientious
and
annoying
and
abruptly
there
returned
to
babbitt
the
doubts
regarding
life
and
families
and
business
which
had
clawed
at
him
when
his
and
the
slim
fairy
girl
had
fled
verona
had
for
six
months
been
at
the
gruensberg
leather
company
offices
with
a
prospect
of
becoming
secretary
to
gruensberg
and
thus
as
babbitt
defined
it
getting
some
good
out
of
your
expensive
college
education
till
you
ready
to
marry
and
settle
but
now
said
verona
father
i
was
talking
to
a
classmate
of
mine
that
working
for
the
associated
charities
oh
dad
there
the
sweetest
little
babies
that
come
to
the
there
and
i
feel
as
though
i
ought
to
be
doing
something
worth
while
like
what
do
you
mean
while
if
you
get
to
be
secretary
and
maybe
you
would
if
you
kept
up
your
shorthand
and
go
sneaking
off
to
concerts
and
talkfests
every
evening
i
guess
find
or
forty
bones
a
week
worth
while
i
know
but
oh
i
want
to
contribute
i
wish
i
were
working
in
a
i
wonder
if
i
could
get
one
of
the
to
let
me
put
in
a
with
a
nice
and
chintzes
and
wicker
chairs
and
so
on
and
so
forth
or
i
could
now
you
look
here
the
first
thing
you
got
to
understand
is
that
all
this
uplift
and
flipflop
and
and
recreation
is
nothing
in
god
world
but
the
entering
wedge
for
socialism
the
sooner
a
man
learns
he
is
going
to
be
coddled
and
he
need
expect
a
lot
of
free
grub
and
uh
all
these
free
classes
and
flipflop
and
doodads
for
his
kids
unless
he
earns
why
the
sooner
he
get
on
the
job
and
produce
produce
produce
that
what
the
country
needs
and
not
all
this
fancy
stuff
that
just
enfeebles
the
of
the
working
man
and
gives
his
kids
a
lot
of
notions
above
their
class
and
you
if
tend
to
business
instead
of
fooling
and
fussing
all
the
time
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
made
up
my
mind
what
i
wanted
to
do
and
stuck
to
it
through
thick
and
thin
and
that
why
i
where
i
am
and
myra
what
do
you
let
the
girl
chop
the
toast
up
into
these
dinky
little
chunks
for
ca
get
your
fist
onto
half
cold
anyway
ted
babbitt
junior
in
the
great
east
side
high
school
had
been
making
sounds
of
interruption
he
blurted

babbitt
flung
in
mechanically
as
he
lighted
the
gloriously
satisfying
first
cigar
of
the
day
and
tasted
the
exhilarating
drug
of
the
headlines

have
a
car
of
my
own
like
lots
of
the
babbitt
almost
rose
a
car
of
your
own
do
you
want
a
yacht
and
a
house
and
lot
that
pretty
nearly
takes
the
cake
a
boy
that
ca
pass
his
latin
examinations
like
any
other
boy
ought
to
and
he
expects
me
to
give
him
a
and
i
suppose
a
chauffeur
and
an
areoplane
maybe
as
a
reward
for
the
hard
work
he
puts
in
going
to
the
movies
with
eunice
littlefield
well
when
you
see
me
giving
you
somewhat
later
after
diplomacies
ted
persuaded
verona
to
admit
that
she
was
merely
going
to
the
armory
that
evening
to
see
the
dog
and
cat
show
she
was
then
ted
planned
to
park
the
car
in
front
of
the
across
from
the
armory
and
he
would
pick
it
up
there
were
masterly
arrangements
regarding
leaving
the
key
and
having
the
gasoline
tank
filled
and
passionately
devotees
of
the
great
god
motor
they
hymned
the
patch
on
the
spare
and
the
lost
their
truce
dissolving
ted
observed
that
her
friends
were
a
scream
of
a
gabby
his
friends
she
indicated
were
disgusting
imitation
sports
and
horrid
little
shrieking
ignorant
further
it
disgusting
of
you
to
smoke
cigarettes
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
those
clothes
you
got
on
this
morning
they
too
utterly
ridiculous
honestly
simply
ted
balanced
over
to
the
low
beveled
mirror
in
the
buffet
regarded
his
charms
and
smirked
his
suit
the
latest
thing
in
old
eli
togs
was
with
skimpy
trousers
to
the
tops
of
his
glaring
tan
boots
a
waistline
pattern
of
an
agitated
check
and
across
the
back
a
belt
which
belted
nothing
his
scarf
was
an
enormous
black
silk
wad
his
flaxen
hair
was
pasted
back
without
parting
when
he
went
to
school
he
would
add
a
cap
with
a
long
vizor
like
a
proudest
of
all
was
his
waistcoat
saved
for
begged
for
plotted
for
a
real
fancy
vest
of
fawn
with
polka
dots
of
a
decayed
red
the
points
astoundingly
long
on
the
lower
edge
of
it
he
wore
a
button
a
class
button
and
a
fraternity
pin
and
none
of
it
mattered
he
was
supple
and
swift
and
flushed
his
eyes
which
he
believed
to
be
cynical
were
candidly
eager
but
he
was
not
he
waved
his
hand
at
poor
dumpy
verona
and
drawled
yes
i
guess
we
pretty
ridiculous
and
disgusticulus
and
i
rather
guess
our
new
necktie
is
some
smear
babbitt
barked
it
is
and
while
you
admiring
yourself
let
me
tell
you
it
might
add
to
your
manly
beauty
if
you
wiped
some
of
that
egg
off
your
mouth
verona
giggled
momentary
victor
in
the
greatest
of
great
wars
which
is
the
family
war
ted
looked
at
her
hopelessly
then
shrieked
at
tinka
for
the
love
o
pete
quit
pouring
the
whole
sugar
bowl
on
your
corn
flakes
when
verona
and
ted
were
gone
and
tinka
upstairs
babbitt
groaned
to
his
wife
nice
family
i
must
say
i
do
pretend
to
be
any
and
maybe
i
a
little
at
breakfast
sometimes
but
the
way
they
go
on
i
simply
ca
stand
it
i
swear
i
feel
like
going
off
some
place
where
i
can
get
a
little
peace
i
do
think
after
a
man
spent
his
lifetime
trying
to
give
his
kids
a
chance
and
a
decent
education
it
pretty
discouraging
to
hear
them
all
the
time
scrapping
like
a
bunch
of
hyenas
and
never
and
never
curious
here
in
the
paper
it
says
never
silent
for
one
mom
seen
the
morning
paper
yet
no
in
years
of
married
life
babbitt
had
seen
the
paper
before
her
husband
just
times
lots
of
news
terrible
big
tornado
in
the
south
hard
luck
all
right
but
this
say
this
is
corking
beginning
of
the
end
for
those
fellows
new
york
assembly
has
passed
some
bills
that
ought
to
completely
outlaw
the
socialists
and
there
an
strike
in
new
york
and
a
lot
of
college
boys
are
taking
their
places
that
the
stuff
and
a
in
birmingham
demanded
that
this
mick
agitator
this
fellow
de
valera
be
deported
dead
right
by
golly
all
these
agitators
paid
with
german
gold
anyway
and
we
got
no
business
interfering
with
the
irish
or
any
other
foreign
government
keep
our
hands
strictly
off
and
there
another
rumor
from
russia
that
lenin
is
dead
that
fine
it
beyond
me
why
we
do
just
step
in
there
and
kick
those
bolshevik
cusses
that
so
said
babbitt
and
it
says
here
a
fellow
was
inaugurated
mayor
in
overalls
a
preacher
too
what
do
you
think
of
that
humph
well
he
searched
for
an
attitude
but
neither
as
a
republican
a
presbyterian
an
elk
nor
a
broker
did
he
have
any
doctrine
about
laid
down
for
him
so
he
grunted
and
went
on
she
looked
sympathetic
and
did
not
hear
a
word
later
she
would
read
the
headlines
the
society
columns
and
the
advertisements
what
do
you
know
about
this
charley
mckelvey
still
doing
the
sassiety
stunt
as
heavy
as
ever
here
what
that
gushy
woman
reporter
says
about
last
night
never
is
society
with
the
big
big
s
more
flattered
than
when
they
are
bidden
to
partake
of
good
cheer
at
the
distinguished
and
hospitable
residence
of
and
charles
mckelvey
as
they
were
last
night
set
in
its
spacious
lawns
and
landscaping
one
of
the
notable
sights
crowning
royal
ridge
but
merry
and
homelike
despite
its
mighty
stone
walls
and
its
vast
rooms
famed
for
their
decoration
their
home
was
thrown
open
last
night
for
a
dance
in
honor
of
mckelvey
notable
guest
miss
sneeth
of
washington
the
wide
hall
is
so
generous
in
its
proportions
that
it
made
a
perfect
ballroom
its
hardwood
floor
reflecting
the
charming
pageant
above
its
polished
surface
even
the
delights
of
dancing
paled
before
the
alluring
opportunities
for
that
invited
the
soul
to
loaf
in
the
long
library
before
the
baronial
fireplace
or
in
the
with
its
deep
comfy
armchairs
its
shaded
lamps
just
made
for
a
sly
whisper
of
pretty
nothings
all
a
deux
or
even
in
the
billiard
room
where
one
could
take
a
cue
and
show
a
prowess
at
still
another
game
than
that
sponsored
by
cupid
and
terpsichore
there
was
more
a
great
deal
more
in
the
best
urban
journalistic
style
of
miss
elnora
pearl
bates
the
popular
society
editor
of
the
but
babbitt
could
not
abide
it
he
grunted
he
wrinkled
the
newspaper
he
protested
can
you
beat
it
i
willing
to
hand
a
lot
of
credit
to
charley
mckelvey
when
we
were
in
college
together
he
was
just
as
hard
up
as
any
of
us
and
he
made
a
million
good
bucks
out
of
contracting
and
has
been
any
dishonester
or
bought
any
more
city
councils
than
was
necessary
and
that
a
good
house
of
his
though
it
ai
any
stone
walls
and
it
ai
worth
the
ninety
thousand
it
cost
him
but
when
it
comes
to
talking
as
though
charley
mckelvey
and
all
that
set
of
his
are
any
blooming
bunch
of
of
of
vanderbilts
why
it
makes
me
tired
timidly
from
babbitt
i
would
like
to
see
the
inside
of
their
house
though
it
must
be
lovely
i
never
been
well
i
have
lots
of
couple
of
times
to
see
chaz
about
business
deals
in
the
evening
it
not
so
much
i
would
want
to
go
there
to
dinner
with
that
gang
of
of
and
i
bet
i
make
a
whole
lot
more
money
than
some
of
those
that
spend
all
they
got
on
and
have
got
a
decent
suit
of
underwear
to
their
name
hey
what
do
you
think
of
this
babbitt
was
strangely
unmoved
by
the
tidings
from
the
real
estate
and
building
column
of
the
ashtabula
street
dawson
to
thomas
mullally
april
x
mtg
nom
and
this
morning
babbitt
was
too
disquieted
to
entertain
her
with
items
from
mechanics
liens
mortgages
recorded
and
contracts
awarded
he
rose
as
he
looked
at
her
his
eyebrows
seemed
shaggier
than
usual
suddenly
yes
maybe
kind
of
shame
to
not
keep
in
touch
with
folks
like
the
mckelveys
we
might
try
inviting
them
to
dinner
some
evening
oh
thunder
let
not
waste
our
good
time
thinking
about
our
little
bunch
has
a
lot
liver
times
than
all
those
plutes
just
compare
a
real
human
like
you
with
these
neurotic
birds
like
lucile
mckelvey
all
highbrow
talk
and
dressed
up
like
a
plush
horse
you
a
great
old
girl
hon
he
covered
his
betrayal
of
softness
with
a
complaining
say
do
let
tinka
go
and
eat
any
more
of
that
poison
nutfudge
for
heaven
sake
try
to
keep
her
from
ruining
her
digestion
i
tell
you
most
folks
appreciate
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
good
digestion
and
regular
habits
be
back
usual
time
i
he
kissed
her
he
did
quite
kiss
her
he
laid
unmoving
lips
against
her
unflushing
cheek
he
hurried
out
to
the
garage
muttering
lord
what
a
family
and
now
myra
is
going
to
get
pathetic
on
me
because
we
do
train
with
this
millionaire
outfit
oh
lord
sometimes
i
like
to
quit
the
whole
game
and
the
office
worry
and
detail
just
as
bad
and
i
act
cranky
and
i
do
mean
to
but
i
get
so
darn
tired
chapter
iii
to
george
babbitt
as
to
most
prosperous
citizens
of
zenith
his
motor
car
was
poetry
and
tragedy
love
and
heroism
the
office
was
his
pirate
ship
but
the
car
his
perilous
excursion
ashore
among
the
tremendous
crises
of
each
day
none
was
more
dramatic
than
starting
the
engine
it
was
slow
on
cold
mornings
there
was
the
long
anxious
whirr
of
the
starter
and
sometimes
he
had
to
drip
ether
into
the
cocks
of
the
cylinders
which
was
so
very
interesting
that
at
lunch
he
would
chronicle
it
drop
by
drop
and
orally
calculate
how
much
each
drop
had
cost
him
this
morning
he
was
darkly
prepared
to
find
something
wrong
and
he
felt
belittled
when
the
mixture
exploded
sweet
and
strong
and
the
car
even
brush
the
gouged
and
splintery
with
many
bruisings
by
fenders
as
he
backed
out
of
the
garage
he
was
confused
he
shouted
morning
to
sam
doppelbrau
with
more
cordiality
than
he
had
intended
babbitt
green
and
white
dutch
colonial
house
was
one
of
three
in
that
block
on
chatham
road
to
the
left
of
it
was
the
residence
of
samuel
doppelbrau
secretary
of
an
excellent
firm
of
jobbers
his
was
a
comfortable
house
with
no
architectural
manners
whatever
a
large
wooden
box
with
a
squat
tower
a
broad
porch
and
glossy
paint
yellow
as
a
yolk
babbitt
disapproved
of
and
doppelbrau
as
from
their
house
came
midnight
music
and
obscene
laughter
there
were
neighborhood
rumors
of
bootlegged
whisky
and
fast
motor
rides
they
furnished
babbitt
with
many
happy
evenings
of
discussion
during
which
he
announced
firmly
i
not
and
i
mind
seeing
a
fellow
throw
in
a
drink
once
in
a
while
but
when
it
comes
to
deliberately
trying
to
get
away
with
a
lot
of
all
the
while
like
the
doppelbraus
do
it
too
rich
for
my
blood
on
the
other
side
of
babbitt
lived
howard
littlefield
in
a
strictly
modern
house
whereof
the
lower
part
was
dark
red
tapestry
brick
with
a
leaded
oriel
the
upper
part
of
pale
stucco
like
spattered
clay
and
the
roof
littlefield
was
the
great
scholar
of
the
neighborhood
the
authority
on
everything
in
the
world
except
babies
cooking
and
motors
he
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
of
blodgett
college
and
a
doctor
of
philosophy
in
economics
of
yale
he
was
the
and
of
the
zenith
street
traction
company
he
could
on
ten
hours
notice
appear
before
the
board
of
aldermen
or
the
state
legislature
and
prove
absolutely
with
figures
all
in
rows
and
with
precedents
from
poland
and
new
zealand
that
the
company
loved
the
public
and
yearned
over
its
employees
that
all
its
stock
was
owned
by
widows
and
orphans
and
that
whatever
it
desired
to
do
would
benefit
by
increasing
rental
values
and
help
the
poor
by
lowering
rents
all
his
acquaintances
turned
to
littlefield
when
they
desired
to
know
the
date
of
the
battle
of
saragossa
the
definition
of
the
word
sabotage
the
future
of
the
german
mark
the
translation
of
hinc
illae
lachrimae
or
the
number
of
products
of
coal
tar
he
awed
babbitt
by
confessing
that
he
often
sat
up
till
midnight
reading
the
figures
and
footnotes
in
government
reports
or
skimming
with
amusement
at
the
author
mistakes
the
latest
volumes
of
chemistry
archeology
and
ichthyology
but
littlefield
great
value
was
as
a
spiritual
example
despite
his
strange
learnings
he
was
as
strict
a
presbyterian
and
as
firm
a
republican
as
george
babbitt
he
confirmed
the
business
men
in
the
faith
where
they
knew
only
by
passionate
instinct
that
their
system
of
industry
and
manners
was
perfect
howard
littlefield
proved
it
to
them
out
of
history
economics
and
the
confessions
of
reformed
radicals
babbitt
had
a
good
deal
of
honest
pride
in
being
the
neighbor
of
such
a
savant
and
in
ted
intimacy
with
eunice
littlefield
at
sixteen
eunice
was
interested
in
no
statistics
save
those
regarding
the
ages
and
salaries
of
stars
but
as
babbitt
definitively
put
it
she
was
her
father
the
difference
between
a
light
man
like
sam
doppelbrau
and
a
really
fine
character
like
littlefield
was
revealed
in
their
appearances
doppelbrau
was
disturbingly
young
for
a
man
of
he
wore
his
derby
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
red
face
was
wrinkled
with
meaningless
laughter
but
littlefield
was
old
for
a
man
of
he
was
tall
broad
thick
his
spectacles
were
engulfed
in
the
folds
of
his
long
face
his
hair
was
a
tossed
mass
of
greasy
blackness
he
puffed
and
rumbled
as
he
talked
his
phi
beta
kappa
key
shone
against
a
spotty
black
vest
he
smelled
of
old
pipes
he
was
altogether
funereal
and
archidiaconal
and
to
brokerage
and
the
jobbing
of
he
added
an
aroma
of
sanctity
this
morning
he
was
in
front
of
his
house
inspecting
the
grass
parking
between
the
curb
and
the
broad
cement
sidewalk
babbitt
stopped
his
car
and
leaned
out
to
shout
mornin
littlefield
lumbered
over
and
stood
with
one
foot
up
on
the
fine
morning
said
babbitt
lighting
illegally
early
his
second
cigar
of
the
day
yes
it
a
mighty
fine
morning
said
littlefield
spring
coming
along
fast
yes
it
real
spring
now
all
right
said
littlefield
still
cold
nights
though
had
to
have
a
couple
blankets
on
the
last
yes
it
was
any
too
warm
last
night
said
littlefield
but
i
do
anticipate
we
have
any
more
real
cold
weather
no
but
still
there
was
snow
at
tiflis
montana
yesterday
said
the
scholar
and
you
remember
the
blizzard
they
had
out
west
three
days
ago
thirty
inches
of
snow
at
greeley
colorado
and
two
years
ago
we
had
a
right
here
in
zenith
on
the
of
is
that
a
fact
say
old
man
what
do
you
think
about
the
republican
candidate
who
they
nominate
for
president
do
you
think
about
time
we
had
a
real
business
administration
in
my
opinion
what
the
country
needs
first
and
foremost
is
a
good
sound
conduct
of
its
affairs
what
we
need
is
a
business
administration
said
littlefield
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
certainly
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
did
know
how
you
feel
about
it
with
all
your
associations
with
colleges
and
so
on
and
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
what
the
country
needs
just
at
this
present
juncture
is
neither
a
college
president
nor
a
lot
of
monkeying
with
foreign
affairs
but
a
good
sound
economical
business
administration
that
will
give
us
a
chance
to
have
something
like
a
decent
yes
it
is
generally
realized
that
even
in
china
the
schoolmen
are
giving
way
to
more
practical
men
and
of
course
you
can
see
what
that
is
that
a
fact
well
well
breathed
babbitt
feeling
much
calmer
and
much
happier
about
the
way
things
were
going
in
the
world
well
been
nice
to
stop
and
parleyvoo
a
second
guess
i
have
to
get
down
to
the
office
now
and
sting
a
few
clients
well
so
long
old
man
see
you
tonight
so
ii
they
had
labored
these
solid
citizens
twenty
years
before
the
hill
on
which
floral
heights
was
spread
with
its
bright
roofs
and
immaculate
turf
and
amazing
comfort
had
been
a
wilderness
of
rank
elms
and
oaks
and
maples
along
the
precise
streets
were
still
a
few
wooded
vacant
lots
and
the
fragment
of
an
old
orchard
it
was
brilliant
the
apple
boughs
were
lit
with
fresh
leaves
like
torches
of
green
fire
the
first
white
of
cherry
blossoms
flickered
down
a
gully
and
robins
clamored
babbitt
sniffed
the
earth
chuckled
at
the
hysteric
robins
as
he
would
have
chuckled
at
kittens
or
at
a
comic
movie
he
was
to
the
eye
the
perfect
executive
a
man
in
a
correct
brown
soft
hat
and
frameless
spectacles
smoking
a
large
cigar
driving
a
good
motor
along
a
parkway
but
in
him
was
some
genius
of
authentic
love
for
his
neighborhood
his
city
his
clan
the
winter
was
over
the
time
was
come
for
the
building
the
visible
growth
which
to
him
was
glory
he
lost
his
dawn
depression
he
was
ruddily
cheerful
when
he
stopped
on
smith
street
to
leave
the
brown
trousers
and
to
have
the
filled
the
familiarity
of
the
rite
fortified
him
the
sight
of
the
tall
red
iron
the
and
garage
the
window
full
of
the
most
agreeable
accessories
shiny
casings
with
immaculate
porcelain
jackets
of
gold
and
silver
he
was
flattered
by
the
friendliness
with
which
sylvester
moon
dirtiest
and
most
skilled
of
motor
mechanics
came
out
to
serve
him
mornin
babbitt
said
moon
and
babbitt
felt
himself
a
person
of
importance
one
whose
name
even
busy
garagemen
remembered
not
one
of
these
flying
around
in
flivvers
he
admired
the
ingenuity
of
the
automatic
dial
clicking
off
gallon
by
gallon
admired
the
smartness
of
the
sign
a
fill
in
time
saves
getting
stuck
gas
cents
admired
the
rhythmic
gurgle
of
the
gasoline
as
it
flowed
into
the
tank
and
the
mechanical
regularity
with
which
moon
turned
the
handle
how
much
we
takin
asked
moon
in
a
manner
which
combined
the
independence
of
the
great
specialist
the
friendliness
of
a
familiar
gossip
and
respect
for
a
man
of
weight
in
the
community
like
george
babbitt
fill
who
you
rootin
for
for
republican
candidate
babbitt
it
too
early
to
make
any
predictions
yet
after
all
there
still
a
good
month
and
two
weeks
no
three
weeks
must
be
almost
three
weeks
well
there
more
than
six
weeks
in
all
before
the
republican
convention
and
i
feel
a
fellow
ought
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
give
all
the
candidates
a
show
look
all
over
and
size
up
and
then
decide
that
a
fact
but
i
tell
you
and
my
stand
on
this
is
just
the
same
as
it
was
four
years
ago
and
eight
years
ago
and
it
be
my
stand
four
years
from
now
yes
and
eight
years
from
now
what
i
tell
everybody
and
it
be
too
generally
understood
is
that
what
we
need
first
last
and
all
the
time
is
a
good
sound
business
administration
by
golly
that
right
how
do
those
front
tires
look
to
you
fine
fine
would
be
much
work
for
garages
if
everybody
looked
after
their
car
the
way
you
well
i
do
try
and
have
some
sense
about
babbitt
paid
his
bill
said
adequately
oh
keep
the
change
and
drove
off
in
an
ecstasy
of
honest
it
was
with
the
manner
of
a
good
samaritan
that
he
shouted
at
a
man
who
was
waiting
for
a
trolley
car
have
a
lift
as
the
man
climbed
in
babbitt
condescended
going
clear
whenever
i
see
a
fellow
waiting
for
a
trolley
i
always
make
it
a
practice
to
give
him
a
lift
unless
of
course
he
looks
like
a
wish
there
were
more
folks
that
were
so
generous
with
their
machines
dutifully
said
the
victim
of
benevolence
oh
no
a
question
of
generosity
hardly
fact
i
always
feel
i
was
saying
to
my
son
just
the
other
night
it
a
fellow
duty
to
share
the
good
things
of
this
world
with
his
neighbors
and
it
gets
my
goat
when
a
fellow
gets
stuck
on
himself
and
goes
around
tooting
his
horn
merely
because
the
victim
seemed
unable
to
find
the
right
answer
babbitt
boomed
on
pretty
punk
service
the
company
giving
us
on
these
nonsense
to
only
run
the
portland
road
cars
once
every
seven
minutes
fellow
gets
mighty
cold
on
a
winter
morning
waiting
on
a
street
corner
with
the
wind
nipping
at
his
that
right
the
street
car
company
do
care
a
damn
what
kind
of
a
deal
they
give
us
something
ought
to
happen
to
babbitt
was
alarmed
but
still
of
course
it
wo
do
to
just
keep
knocking
the
traction
company
and
not
realize
the
difficulties
operating
under
like
these
cranks
that
want
municipal
ownership
the
way
these
workmen
hold
up
the
company
for
high
wages
is
simply
a
crime
and
of
course
the
burden
falls
on
you
and
me
that
have
to
pay
a
fare
fact
there
remarkable
service
on
all
their
lines
well
uneasily
darn
fine
morning
babbitt
explained
spring
coming
along
yes
it
real
spring
the
victim
had
no
originality
no
wit
and
babbitt
fell
into
a
great
silence
and
devoted
himself
to
the
game
of
beating
trolley
cars
to
the
corner
a
spurt
a
nervous
speeding
between
the
huge
yellow
side
of
the
trolley
and
the
jagged
row
of
parked
motors
shooting
past
just
as
the
trolley
stopped
a
rare
game
and
valiant
and
all
the
while
he
was
conscious
of
the
loveliness
of
zenith
for
weeks
together
he
noticed
nothing
but
clients
and
the
vexing
to
rent
signs
of
rival
brokers
in
mysterious
malaise
he
raged
or
rejoiced
with
equal
nervous
swiftness
and
the
light
of
spring
was
so
winsome
that
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
he
admired
each
district
along
his
familiar
route
to
the
office
the
bungalows
and
shrubs
and
winding
irregular
drive
ways
of
floral
heights
the
shops
on
smith
street
a
glare
of
and
new
yellow
brick
groceries
and
laundries
and
to
supply
the
more
immediate
needs
of
east
side
housewives
the
market
gardens
in
dutch
hollow
their
shanties
patched
with
corrugated
iron
and
stolen
doors
billboards
with
crimson
goddesses
nine
feet
tall
advertising
cinema
films
pipe
tobacco
and
talcum
powder
the
old
mansions
along
ninth
street
like
aged
dandies
in
filthy
linen
wooden
castles
turned
into
with
muddy
walks
and
rusty
hedges
jostled
by
garages
cheap
and
conducted
by
bland
sleek
athenians
across
the
belt
of
factories
with
and
tall
producing
condensed
milk
paper
boxes
motor
cars
then
the
business
center
the
thickening
darting
traffic
the
crammed
trolleys
unloading
and
high
doorways
of
marble
and
polished
granite
it
was
big
and
babbitt
respected
bigness
in
anything
in
mountains
jewels
muscles
wealth
or
words
he
was
for
a
moment
the
lyric
and
almost
unselfish
lover
of
zenith
he
thought
of
the
outlying
factory
suburbs
of
the
chaloosa
river
with
its
strangely
eroded
banks
of
the
tonawanda
hills
to
the
north
and
all
the
fat
dairy
land
and
big
barns
and
comfortable
herds
as
he
dropped
his
passenger
he
cried
gosh
i
feel
pretty
good
this
morning
iii
epochal
as
starting
the
car
was
the
drama
of
parking
it
before
he
entered
his
office
as
he
turned
from
oberlin
avenue
round
the
corner
into
third
street
he
peered
ahead
for
a
space
in
the
line
of
parked
cars
he
angrily
just
missed
a
space
as
a
rival
driver
slid
into
it
ahead
another
car
was
leaving
the
curb
and
babbitt
slowed
up
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
cars
pressing
on
him
from
behind
agitatedly
motioning
an
old
woman
to
go
ahead
avoiding
a
truck
which
bore
down
on
him
from
one
side
with
front
wheels
nicking
the
bumper
of
the
car
in
front
he
stopped
feverishly
cramped
his
slid
back
into
the
vacant
space
and
with
eighteen
inches
of
room
manoeuvered
to
bring
the
car
level
with
the
curb
it
was
a
virile
adventure
masterfully
executed
with
satisfaction
he
locked
a
steel
wedge
on
the
front
wheel
and
crossed
the
street
to
his
office
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
reeves
building
the
reeves
building
was
as
fireproof
as
a
rock
and
as
efficient
as
a
typewriter
fourteen
stories
of
yellow
pressed
brick
with
clean
upright
unornamented
lines
it
was
filled
with
the
offices
of
lawyers
doctors
agents
for
machinery
for
emery
wheels
for
wire
fencing
for
their
gold
signs
shone
on
the
windows
the
entrance
was
too
modern
to
be
flamboyant
with
pillars
it
was
quiet
shrewd
neat
along
the
third
street
side
were
a
western
union
telegraph
office
the
blue
delft
candy
shop
shotwell
stationery
shop
and
the
realty
company
babbitt
could
have
entered
his
office
from
the
street
as
customers
did
but
it
made
him
feel
an
insider
to
go
through
the
corridor
of
the
building
and
enter
by
the
back
door
thus
he
was
greeted
by
the
villagers
the
little
unknown
people
who
inhabited
the
reeves
building
corridors
starter
engineers
superintendent
and
the
lame
man
who
conducted
the
news
and
cigar
stand
were
in
no
way
they
were
rustics
living
in
a
constricted
valley
interested
only
in
one
another
and
in
the
building
their
main
street
was
the
entrance
hall
with
its
stone
floor
severe
marble
ceiling
and
the
inner
windows
of
the
shops
the
liveliest
place
on
the
street
was
the
reeves
building
barber
shop
but
this
was
also
one
embarrassment
himself
he
patronized
the
glittering
pompeian
barber
shop
in
the
hotel
thornleigh
and
every
time
he
passed
the
reeves
shop
ten
times
a
day
a
hundred
times
he
felt
untrue
to
his
own
village
now
as
one
of
the
squirearchy
greeted
with
honorable
salutations
by
the
villagers
he
marched
into
his
office
and
peace
and
dignity
were
upon
him
and
the
morning
dissonances
all
unheard
they
were
heard
again
immediately
stanley
graff
the
outside
salesman
was
talking
on
the
telephone
with
tragic
lack
of
that
firm
manner
which
disciplines
clients
say
uh
i
think
i
got
just
the
house
that
would
suit
you
the
percival
house
in
linton
oh
you
seen
it
well
how
it
strike
you
huh
oh
irresolutely
oh
i
as
babbitt
marched
into
his
private
room
a
coop
with
of
oak
and
frosted
glass
at
the
back
of
the
office
he
reflected
how
hard
it
was
to
find
employees
who
had
his
own
faith
that
he
was
going
to
make
sales
there
were
nine
members
of
the
staff
besides
babbitt
and
his
partner
and
henry
thompson
who
rarely
came
to
the
office
the
nine
were
stanley
graff
the
outside
salesman
a
youngish
man
given
to
cigarettes
and
the
playing
of
pool
old
mat
penniman
general
utility
man
collector
of
rents
and
salesman
of
insurance
broken
silent
gray
a
mystery
reputed
to
have
been
a
crack
man
with
a
firm
of
his
own
in
haughty
brooklyn
chester
kirby
laylock
resident
salesman
out
at
the
glen
oriole
acreage
development
an
enthusiastic
person
with
a
silky
mustache
and
much
family
miss
theresa
mcgoun
the
swift
and
rather
pretty
stenographer
miss
wilberta
bannigan
the
thick
slow
laborious
accountant
and
and
four
freelance
commission
salesmen
as
he
looked
from
his
own
cage
into
the
main
room
babbitt
mourned
mcgoun
a
good
smart
a
whip
but
stan
graff
and
all
those
bums
the
zest
of
the
spring
morning
was
smothered
in
the
stale
office
air
normally
he
admired
the
office
with
a
pleased
surprise
that
he
should
have
created
this
sure
lovely
thing
normally
he
was
stimulated
by
the
clean
newness
of
it
and
the
air
of
bustle
but
it
seemed
flat
the
tiled
floor
like
a
bathroom
the
metal
ceiling
the
faded
maps
on
the
hard
plaster
walls
the
chairs
of
varnished
pale
oak
the
desks
and
of
steel
painted
in
olive
drab
it
was
a
vault
a
steel
chapel
where
loafing
and
laughter
were
raw
sin
he
had
even
any
satisfaction
in
the
new
and
it
was
the
very
best
of
scientific
and
it
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
in
itself
a
virtue
it
possessed
a
fiber
a
porcelain
guaranteed
hygienic
a
sanitary
faucet
and
decorations
in
two
tones
of
gold
he
looked
down
the
relentless
stretch
of
tiled
floor
at
the
and
assured
himself
that
no
tenant
of
the
reeves
building
had
a
more
expensive
one
but
he
could
not
recapture
the
feeling
of
social
superiority
it
had
given
him
he
astoundingly
grunted
i
like
to
beat
it
off
to
the
woods
right
now
and
loaf
all
day
and
go
to
gunch
again
and
play
poker
and
cuss
as
much
as
i
feel
like
and
drink
a
hundred
and
bottles
of
he
sighed
he
read
through
his
mail
he
shouted
msgoun
which
meant
miss
mcgoun
and
began
to
dictate
this
was
his
own
version
of
his
first
letter
omar
gribble
send
it
to
his
office
miss
mcgoun
yours
of
twentieth
to
hand
and
in
reply
would
say
look
here
gribble
i
awfully
afraid
if
we
go
on
like
this
we
just
naturally
lose
the
allen
sale
i
had
allen
up
on
carpet
day
before
yesterday
and
got
right
down
to
cases
and
think
i
can
assure
you
uh
uh
no
change
that
all
my
experience
indicates
he
is
all
right
means
to
do
business
looked
into
his
financial
record
which
is
fine
that
sentence
seems
to
be
a
little
balled
up
miss
mcgoun
make
a
couple
sentences
out
of
it
if
you
have
to
period
new
paragraph
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
pro
rate
the
special
assessment
and
strikes
me
am
dead
sure
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
pay
for
title
insurance
so
now
for
heaven
sake
let
get
busy
no
make
that
so
now
let
go
to
it
and
get
down
no
that
enough
you
can
tie
those
sentences
up
a
little
better
when
you
type
miss
mcgoun
your
sincerely
this
is
the
version
of
his
letter
which
he
received
typed
from
miss
mcgoun
that
afternoon
realty
homes
for
folks
reeves
oberlin
avenue
zenith
omar
gribble
north
american
building
zenith
dear
gribble
your
letter
of
the
twentieth
to
hand
i
must
say
i
awfully
afraid
that
if
we
go
on
like
this
we
just
naturally
lose
the
allen
sale
i
had
allen
up
on
the
carpet
day
before
yesterday
and
got
right
down
to
cases
all
my
experience
indicates
that
he
means
to
do
business
i
have
also
looked
into
his
financial
record
which
is
fine
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
pro
rate
the
special
assessment
and
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
pay
for
title
insurance
so
let
go
yours
sincerely
as
he
read
and
signed
it
in
his
correct
flowing
hand
babbitt
reflected
now
that
a
good
strong
letter
and
clear
a
bell
now
what
the
i
never
told
mcgoun
to
make
a
third
paragraph
there
wish
she
quit
trying
to
improve
on
my
dictation
but
what
i
understand
is
why
ca
stan
graff
or
chet
laylock
write
a
letter
like
that
with
punch
with
a
kick
the
most
important
thing
he
dictated
that
morning
was
the
fortnightly
to
be
mimeographed
and
sent
out
to
a
thousand
it
was
diligently
imitative
of
the
best
literary
models
of
the
day
of
advertisements
letters
discourses
on
the
development
of
and
as
richly
poured
forth
by
the
new
school
of
poets
of
business
he
had
painfully
written
out
a
first
draft
and
he
intoned
it
now
like
a
poet
delicate
and
distrait
say
old
man
i
just
want
to
know
can
i
do
you
a
whaleuva
favor
honest
no
kidding
i
know
you
interested
in
getting
a
house
not
merely
a
place
where
you
hang
up
the
old
bonnet
but
a
for
the

babbitt
sat
creakily
back
in
his
revolving
and
beamed
on
miss
mcgoun
he
was
conscious
of
her
as
a
girl
of
black
bobbed
hair
against
demure
cheeks
a
longing
which
was
indistinguishable
from
loneliness
enfeebled
him
while
she
waited
tapping
a
long
precise
on
the
he
half
identified
her
with
the
fairy
girl
of
his
dreams
he
imagined
their
eyes
meeting
with
terrifying
recognition
imagined
touching
her
lips
with
frightened
reverence
and
she
was
chirping
any
more
mist
babbitt
he
grunted
that
winds
it
up
i
guess
and
turned
heavily
away
for
all
his
wandering
thoughts
they
had
never
been
more
intimate
than
this
he
often
reflected
nev
forget
how
old
jake
offutt
said
a
wise
bird
never
goes
in
his
own
office
or
his
own
home
start
trouble
sure
but
in
years
of
married
life
he
had
peered
uneasily
at
every
graceful
ankle
every
soft
shoulder
in
thought
he
had
treasured
them
but
not
once
had
he
hazarded
respectability
by
adventuring
now
as
he
calculated
the
cost
of
repapering
the
styles
house
he
was
restless
again
discontented
about
nothing
and
everything
ashamed
of
his
discontentment
and
lonely
for
the
fairy
girl
chapter
iv
it
was
a
morning
of
artistic
creation
fifteen
minutes
after
the
purple
prose
of
babbitt
chester
kirby
laylock
the
resident
salesman
at
glen
oriole
came
in
to
report
a
sale
and
submit
an
advertisement
babbitt
disapproved
of
laylock
who
sang
in
choirs
and
was
merry
at
home
over
games
of
hearts
and
old
maid
he
had
a
tenor
voice
wavy
chestnut
hair
and
a
mustache
like
a
brush
babbitt
considered
it
excusable
in
a
to
growl
seen
this
new
picture
of
the
kid
husky
little
devil
eh
but
laylock
domestic
confidences
were
as
bubbling
as
a
girl
say
i
think
i
got
a
peach
of
an
ad
for
the
glen
babbitt
why
do
we
try
something
in
poetry
honest
it
have
wonderful
listen
pleasures
and
palaces
wherever
you
may
roam
you
just
provide
the
little
bride
and
we
provide
the
home
do
you
get
it
see
like
sweet
home
do
you
yes
yes
yes
hell
yes
of
course
i
get
it
but
oh
i
think
better
use
something
more
dignified
and
forceful
like
lead
others
follow
or
why
not
now
course
i
believe
in
using
poetry
and
humor
and
all
that
junk
when
it
turns
the
trick
but
with
a
restricted
development
like
the
glen
we
better
stick
to
the
more
dignified
approach
see
how
i
mean
well
i
guess
that
all
this
morning
ii
by
a
tragedy
familiar
to
the
world
of
art
the
april
enthusiasm
of
chet
laylock
served
only
to
stimulate
the
talent
of
the
older
craftsman
george
babbitt
he
grumbled
to
stanley
graff
that
voice
of
chet
gets
on
my
nerves
yet
he
was
aroused
and
in
one
swoop
he
wrote
do
you
respect
your
loved
ones
when
the
last
sad
rites
of
bereavement
are
over
do
you
know
for
certain
that
you
have
done
your
best
for
the
departed
you
have
unless
they
lie
in
the
cemetery
beautiful
linden
lane
the
only
strictly
burial
place
in
or
near
zenith
where
exquisitely
gardened
plots
look
from
across
the
smiling
fields
of
dorchester
sole
agents
realty
company
reeves
building
he
rejoiced
i
guess
that
show
chan
mott
and
his
weedy
old
wildwood
cemetery
something
about
modern
merchandizing
iii
he
sent
mat
penniman
to
the
recorder
office
to
dig
out
the
names
of
the
owners
of
houses
which
were
displaying
for
rent
signs
of
other
brokers
he
talked
to
a
man
who
desired
to
lease
a
for
a
he
ran
over
the
list
of
which
were
about
to
expire
he
sent
thomas
bywaters
a
conductor
who
played
at
real
estate
in
spare
time
to
call
on
prospects
who
were
unworthy
the
strategies
of
stanley
graff
but
he
had
spent
his
credulous
excitement
of
creation
and
these
routine
details
annoyed
him
one
moment
of
heroism
he
had
in
discovering
a
new
way
of
stopping
smoking
he
stopped
smoking
at
least
once
a
month
he
went
through
with
it
like
the
solid
citizen
he
was
admitted
the
evils
of
tobacco
courageously
made
resolves
laid
out
plans
to
check
the
vice
tapered
off
his
allowance
of
cigars
and
expounded
the
pleasures
of
virtuousness
to
every
one
he
met
he
did
everything
in
fact
except
stop
smoking
two
months
before
by
ruling
out
a
schedule
noting
down
the
hour
and
minute
of
each
smoke
and
ecstatically
increasing
the
intervals
between
smokes
he
had
brought
himself
down
to
three
cigars
a
day
then
he
had
lost
the
schedule
a
week
ago
he
had
invented
a
system
of
leaving
his
and
in
an
unused
drawer
at
the
bottom
of
the
in
the
outer
office
i
just
naturally
be
ashamed
to
go
poking
in
there
all
day
long
making
a
fool
of
myself
before
my
own
employees
he
reasoned
by
the
end
of
three
days
he
was
trained
to
leave
his
desk
walk
to
the
file
take
out
and
light
a
cigar
without
knowing
that
he
was
doing
it
this
morning
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
it
had
been
too
easy
to
open
the
file
lock
it
that
was
the
thing
inspired
he
rushed
out
and
locked
up
his
cigars
his
cigarettes
and
even
his
box
of
safety
matches
and
the
key
to
the
file
drawer
he
hid
in
his
desk
but
the
crusading
passion
of
it
made
him
so
that
he
immediately
recovered
the
key
walked
with
forbidding
dignity
to
the
file
took
out
a
cigar
and
a
match
but
only
one
match
if
ole
cigar
goes
out
by
golly
have
to
stay
out
later
when
the
cigar
did
go
out
he
took
one
more
match
from
the
file
and
when
a
buyer
and
a
seller
came
in
for
a
conference
at
naturally
he
had
to
offer
them
cigars
his
conscience
protested
why
you
smoking
with
them
but
he
bullied
it
oh
shut
up
i
busy
now
of
course
there
was
no
yet
his
belief
that
he
had
crushed
the
unclean
habit
made
him
feel
noble
and
very
happy
when
he
called
up
paul
riesling
he
was
in
his
moral
splendor
unusually
eager
he
was
fonder
of
paul
riesling
than
of
any
one
on
earth
except
himself
and
his
daughter
tinka
they
had
been
classmates
roommates
in
the
state
university
but
always
he
thought
of
paul
riesling
with
his
dark
slimness
his
precisely
parted
hair
his
his
hesitant
speech
his
moodiness
his
love
of
music
as
a
younger
brother
to
be
petted
and
protected
paul
had
gone
into
his
father
business
after
graduation
he
was
now
a
wholesaler
and
small
manufacturer
of
roofing
but
babbitt
strenuously
believed
and
lengthily
announced
to
the
world
of
good
fellows
that
paul
could
have
been
a
great
violinist
or
painter
or
writer
why
say
the
letters
that
boy
sent
me
on
his
trip
to
the
canadian
rockies
they
just
absolutely
make
you
see
the
place
as
if
you
were
standing
there
believe
me
he
could
have
given
any
of
these
bloomin
authors
a
whale
of
a
run
for
their
money
yet
on
the
telephone
they
said
only
south
no
no
no
i
said
south
south
say
operator
what
the
dickens
is
the
trouble
ca
you
get
me
south
why
certainly
they
answer
oh
hello
wanta

to
middlin
how

how
lil
lunch
noon
be
all
right
with
me
i
guess
club
yuh
meet
you
there
a
right
s
long
iv
his
morning
was
not
sharply
marked
into
divisions
interwoven
with
correspondence
and
were
a
thousand
nervous
details
calls
from
clerks
who
were
incessantly
and
hopefully
seeking
five
furnished
rooms
and
bath
at
sixty
dollars
a
month
advice
to
mat
penniman
on
getting
money
out
of
tenants
who
had
no
money
babbitt
virtues
as
a
broker
as
the
servant
of
society
in
the
department
of
finding
homes
for
families
and
shops
for
distributors
of
food
were
steadiness
and
diligence
he
was
conventionally
honest
he
kept
his
records
of
buyers
and
sellers
complete
he
had
experience
with
leases
and
titles
and
an
excellent
memory
for
prices
his
shoulders
were
broad
enough
his
voice
deep
enough
his
relish
of
hearty
humor
strong
enough
to
establish
him
as
one
of
the
ruling
caste
of
good
fellows
yet
his
eventual
importance
to
mankind
was
perhaps
lessened
by
his
large
and
complacent
ignorance
of
all
architecture
save
the
types
of
houses
turned
out
by
speculative
builders
all
landscape
gardening
save
the
use
of
curving
roads
grass
and
six
ordinary
shrubs
and
all
the
commonest
axioms
of
economics
he
serenely
believed
that
the
one
purpose
of
the
business
was
to
make
money
for
george
babbitt
true
it
was
a
good
advertisement
at
boosters
club
lunches
and
all
the
varieties
of
annual
banquets
to
which
good
fellows
were
invited
to
speak
sonorously
of
unselfish
public
service
the
broker
obligation
to
keep
inviolate
the
trust
of
his
clients
and
a
thing
called
ethics
whose
nature
was
confusing
but
if
you
had
it
you
were
a
realtor
and
if
you
had
you
were
a
shyster
a
piker
and
a
these
virtues
awakened
confidence
and
enabled
you
to
handle
bigger
propositions
but
they
did
imply
that
you
were
to
be
impractical
and
refuse
to
take
twice
the
value
of
a
house
if
a
buyer
was
such
an
idiot
that
he
did
jew
you
down
on
the
babbitt
spoke
well
and
often
at
these
orgies
of
commercial
righteousness
about
the
realtor
function
as
a
seer
of
the
future
development
of
the
community
and
as
a
prophetic
engineer
clearing
the
pathway
for
inevitable
changes
which
meant
that
a
broker
could
make
money
by
guessing
which
way
the
town
would
grow
this
guessing
he
called
vision
in
an
address
at
the
boosters
club
he
had
admitted
it
is
at
once
the
duty
and
the
privilege
of
the
realtor
to
know
everything
about
his
own
city
and
its
environs
where
a
surgeon
is
a
specialist
on
every
vein
and
mysterious
cell
of
the
human
body
and
the
engineer
upon
electricity
in
all
its
phases
or
every
bolt
of
some
great
bridge
majestically
arching
a
mighty
flood
the
realtor
must
know
his
city
inch
by
inch
and
all
its
faults
and
though
he
did
know
the
inch
by
inch
of
certain
districts
of
zenith
he
did
not
know
whether
the
police
force
was
too
large
or
too
small
or
whether
it
was
in
alliance
with
gambling
and
prostitution
he
knew
the
means
of
buildings
and
the
relation
of
to
but
he
did
not
know
how
many
firemen
there
were
in
the
city
how
they
were
trained
and
paid
or
how
complete
their
apparatus
he
sang
eloquently
the
advantages
of
proximity
of
to
rentable
homes
but
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
worth
while
to
know
whether
the
city
schoolrooms
were
properly
heated
lighted
ventilated
furnished
he
did
not
know
how
the
teachers
were
chosen
and
though
he
chanted
one
of
the
boasts
of
zenith
is
that
we
pay
our
teachers
adequately
that
was
because
he
had
read
the
statement
in
the
himself
he
could
not
have
given
the
average
salary
of
teachers
in
zenith
or
anywhere
else
he
had
heard
it
said
that
conditions
in
the
county
jail
and
the
zenith
city
prison
were
not
very
scientific
he
had
with
indignation
at
the
criticism
of
zenith
skimmed
through
a
report
in
which
the
notorious
pessimist
seneca
doane
the
radical
lawyer
asserted
that
to
throw
boys
and
young
girls
into
a
crammed
with
men
suffering
from
syphilis
delirium
tremens
and
insanity
was
not
the
perfect
way
of
educating
them
he
had
controverted
the
report
by
growling
folks
that
think
a
jail
ought
to
be
a
bloomin
hotel
thornleigh
make
me
sick
if
people
do
like
a
jail
let
behave
and
keep
out
of
it
besides
these
reform
cranks
always
that
was
the
beginning
and
quite
completely
the
end
of
his
investigations
into
charities
and
corrections
and
as
to
the
vice
districts
he
brightly
expressed
it
those
are
things
that
no
decent
man
monkeys
with
besides
smatter
fact
i
tell
you
confidentially
it
a
protection
to
our
daughters
and
to
decent
women
to
have
a
district
where
tough
nuts
can
raise
cain
keeps
away
from
our
own
as
to
industrial
conditions
however
babbitt
had
thought
a
great
deal
and
his
opinions
may
be
coordinated
as
follows
a
good
labor
union
is
of
value
because
it
keeps
out
radical
unions
which
would
destroy
property
no
one
ought
to
be
forced
to
belong
to
a
union
however
all
labor
agitators
who
try
to
force
men
to
join
a
union
should
be
hanged
in
fact
just
between
ourselves
there
ought
to
be
any
unions
allowed
at
all
and
as
it
the
best
way
of
fighting
the
unions
every
business
man
ought
to
belong
to
an
and
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
in
union
there
is
strength
so
any
selfish
hog
who
does
join
the
chamber
of
commerce
ought
to
be
forced
in
nothing
as
the
expert
on
whose
advice
families
moved
to
new
neighborhoods
to
live
there
for
a
generation
was
babbitt
more
splendidly
innocent
than
in
the
science
of
sanitation
he
did
not
know
a
mosquito
from
a
bat
he
knew
nothing
about
tests
of
drinking
water
and
in
the
matters
of
plumbing
and
sewage
he
was
as
unlearned
as
he
was
voluble
he
often
referred
to
the
excellence
of
the
bathrooms
in
the
houses
he
sold
he
was
fond
of
explaining
why
it
was
that
no
european
ever
bathed
some
one
had
told
him
when
he
was
that
all
cesspools
were
unhealthy
and
he
still
denounced
them
if
a
client
impertinently
wanted
him
to
sell
a
house
which
had
a
cesspool
babbitt
always
spoke
about
it
before
accepting
the
house
and
selling
it
when
he
laid
out
the
glen
oriole
acreage
development
when
he
ironed
woodland
and
dipping
meadow
into
a
glenless
orioleless
sunburnt
flat
prickly
with
small
boards
displaying
the
names
of
imaginary
streets
he
righteously
put
in
a
complete
it
made
him
feel
superior
it
enabled
him
to
sneer
privily
at
the
martin
lumsen
development
avonlea
which
had
a
cesspool
and
it
provided
a
chorus
for
the
advertisements
in
which
he
announced
the
beauty
convenience
cheapness
and
supererogatory
healthfulness
of
glen
oriole
the
only
flaw
was
that
the
glen
oriole
sewers
had
insufficient
outlet
so
that
waste
remained
in
them
not
very
agreeably
while
the
avonlea
cesspool
was
a
waring
septic
tank
the
whole
of
the
glen
oriole
project
was
a
suggestion
that
babbitt
though
he
really
did
hate
men
recognized
as
swindlers
was
not
too
unreasonably
honest
operators
and
buyers
prefer
that
brokers
should
not
be
in
competition
with
them
as
operators
and
buyers
themselves
but
attend
to
their
clients
interests
only
it
was
supposed
that
the
company
were
merely
agents
for
glen
oriole
serving
the
real
owner
jake
offutt
but
the
fact
was
that
babbitt
and
thompson
owned
per
cent
of
the
glen
the
president
and
purchasing
agent
of
the
zenith
street
traction
company
owned
per
and
jake
offutt
a
a
small
manufacturer
a
old
farceur
who
enjoyed
dirty
politics
business
diplomacy
and
cheating
at
poker
had
only
ten
per
which
babbitt
and
the
traction
officials
had
given
to
him
for
fixing
health
inspectors
and
fire
inspectors
and
a
member
of
the
state
transportation
commission
but
babbitt
was
virtuous
he
advocated
though
he
did
not
practise
the
prohibition
of
alcohol
he
praised
though
he
did
not
obey
the
laws
against
he
paid
his
debts
he
contributed
to
the
church
the
red
cross
and
the
he
followed
the
custom
of
his
clan
and
cheated
only
as
it
was
sanctified
by
precedent
and
he
never
descended
to
trickery
though
as
he
explained
to
paul
riesling
course
i
do
mean
to
say
that
every
ad
i
write
is
literally
true
or
that
i
always
believe
everything
i
say
when
i
give
some
buyer
a
good
strong
you
see
you
see
it
like
this
in
the
first
place
maybe
the
owner
of
the
property
exaggerated
when
he
put
it
into
my
hands
and
it
certainly
is
my
place
to
go
proving
my
principal
a
liar
and
then
most
folks
are
so
darn
crooked
themselves
that
they
expect
a
fellow
to
do
a
little
lying
so
if
i
was
fool
enough
to
never
whoop
the
ante
i
get
the
credit
for
lying
anyway
in
i
got
to
toot
my
own
horn
like
a
lawyer
defending
a
client
his
bounden
duty
ai
it
to
bring
out
the
poor
dub
good
points
why
the
judge
himself
would
bawl
out
a
lawyer
that
did
even
if
they
both
knew
the
guy
was
guilty
but
even
so
i
do
pad
out
the
truth
like
cecil
rountree
or
thayer
or
the
rest
of
these
realtors
fact
i
think
a
fellow
that
willing
to
deliberately
up
and
profit
by
lying
ought
to
be
shot
babbitt
value
to
his
clients
was
rarely
better
shown
than
this
morning
in
the
conference
at
between
himself
conrad
lyte
and
archibald
purdy
v
conrad
lyte
was
a
speculator
he
was
a
nervous
speculator
before
he
gambled
he
consulted
bankers
lawyers
architects
contracting
builders
and
all
of
their
clerks
and
stenographers
who
were
willing
to
be
cornered
and
give
him
advice
he
was
a
bold
entrepreneur
and
he
desired
nothing
more
than
complete
safety
in
his
investments
freedom
from
attention
to
details
and
the
thirty
or
forty
per
cent
profit
which
according
to
all
authorities
a
pioneer
deserves
for
his
risks
and
foresight
he
was
a
stubby
man
with
a
mass
of
short
gray
curls
and
clothes
which
no
matter
how
well
cut
seemed
shaggy
below
his
eyes
were
semicircular
hollows
as
though
silver
dollars
had
been
pressed
against
them
and
had
left
an
imprint
particularly
and
always
lyte
consulted
babbitt
and
trusted
in
his
slow
cautiousness
six
months
ago
babbitt
had
learned
that
one
archibald
purdy
a
grocer
in
the
indecisive
residential
district
known
as
linton
was
talking
of
opening
a
butcher
shop
beside
his
grocery
looking
up
the
ownership
of
adjoining
parcels
of
land
babbitt
found
that
purdy
owned
his
present
shop
but
did
not
own
the
one
available
lot
adjoining
he
advised
conrad
lyte
to
purchase
this
lot
for
eleven
thousand
dollars
though
an
appraisal
on
a
basis
of
rents
did
not
indicate
its
value
as
above
nine
thousand
the
rents
declared
babbitt
were
too
low
and
by
waiting
they
could
make
purdy
come
to
their
price
this
was
vision
he
had
to
bully
lyte
into
buying
his
first
act
as
agent
for
lyte
was
to
increase
the
rent
of
the
battered
on
the
lot
the
tenant
said
a
number
of
rude
things
but
he
paid
now
purdy
seemed
ready
to
buy
and
his
delay
was
going
to
cost
him
ten
thousand
extra
dollars
the
reward
paid
by
the
community
to
conrad
lyte
for
the
virtue
of
employing
a
broker
who
had
vision
and
who
understood
talking
points
strategic
values
key
situations
underappraisals
and
the
psychology
of
salesmanship
lyte
came
to
the
conference
exultantly
he
was
fond
of
babbitt
this
morning
and
called
him
old
purdy
the
grocer
a
man
and
solemn
seemed
to
care
less
for
babbitt
and
for
vision
but
babbitt
met
him
at
the
street
door
of
the
office
and
guided
him
toward
the
private
room
with
affectionate
little
cries
of
this
way
brother
purdy
he
took
from
the
the
entire
box
of
cigars
and
forced
them
on
his
guests
he
pushed
their
chairs
two
inches
forward
and
three
inches
back
which
gave
an
hospitable
note
then
leaned
back
in
his
and
looked
plump
and
jolly
but
he
spoke
to
the
weakling
grocer
with
firmness
well
brother
purdy
we
been
having
some
pretty
tempting
offers
from
butchers
and
a
slew
of
other
folks
for
that
lot
next
to
your
store
but
i
persuaded
brother
lyte
that
we
ought
to
give
you
a
shot
at
the
property
first
i
said
to
lyte
be
a
rotten
shame
i
said
somebody
went
and
opened
a
combination
grocery
and
meat
market
right
next
door
and
ruined
purdy
nice
little
business
especially
babbitt
leaned
forward
and
his
voice
was
harsh
it
would
be
hard
luck
if
one
of
these
got
in
there
and
started
cutting
prices
below
cost
till
they
got
rid
of
competition
and
forced
you
to
the
wall
purdy
snatched
his
thin
hands
from
his
pockets
pulled
up
his
trousers
thrust
his
hands
back
into
his
pockets
tilted
in
the
heavy
oak
chair
and
tried
to
look
amused
as
he
struggled
yes
they
bad
competition
but
i
guess
you
do
realize
the
pulling
power
that
personality
has
in
a
neighborhood
the
great
babbitt
smiled
that
so
just
as
you
feel
old
man
we
thought
we
give
you
first
chance
all
right
then
now
look
here
purdy
wailed
i
know
a
fact
that
a
piece
of
property
same
size
right
near
sold
for
less
hundred
two
years
ago
and
here
you
fellows
are
asking
me
thousand
dollars
why
i
have
to
mortgage
i
would
mind
so
much
paying
twelve
thousand
but
why
good
god
babbitt
asking
more
twice
its
value
and
threatening
to
ruin
me
if
i
take
it
purdy
i
do
like
your
way
of
talking
i
do
like
it
one
little
bit
supposing
lyte
and
i
were
stinking
enough
to
want
to
ruin
any
fellow
human
do
you
suppose
we
know
it
to
our
own
selfish
interest
to
have
everybody
in
zenith
prosperous
but
all
this
is
beside
the
point
tell
you
what
we
do
we
come
down
to
thousand
down
and
the
rest
on
mortgage
and
if
you
want
to
wreck
the
old
shack
and
rebuild
i
guess
i
can
get
lyte
here
to
loosen
up
for
a
on
good
liberal
terms
heavens
man
be
glad
to
oblige
you
we
do
like
these
foreign
grocery
trusts
any
better
you
do
but
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
us
to
sacrifice
eleven
thousand
or
more
just
for
neighborliness
is
it
how
about
it
lyte
you
willing
to
come
down
by
warmly
taking
purdy
part
babbitt
persuaded
the
benevolent
lyte
to
reduce
his
price
to
thousand
dollars
at
the
right
moment
babbitt
snatched
from
a
drawer
the
agreement
he
had
had
miss
mcgoun
type
out
a
week
ago
and
thrust
it
into
purdy
hands
he
genially
shook
his
fountain
pen
to
make
certain
that
it
was
flowing
handed
it
to
purdy
and
approvingly
watched
him
sign
the
work
of
the
world
was
being
done
lyte
had
made
something
over
nine
thousand
dollars
babbitt
had
made
a
dollar
commission
purdy
had
by
the
sensitive
mechanism
of
modern
finance
been
provided
with
a
and
soon
the
happy
inhabitants
of
linton
would
have
meat
lavished
upon
them
at
prices
only
a
little
higher
than
those
it
had
been
a
manly
battle
but
after
it
babbitt
drooped
this
was
the
only
really
amusing
contest
he
had
been
planning
there
was
nothing
ahead
save
details
of
leases
appraisals
mortgages
he
muttered
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
lyte
carrying
off
most
of
the
profit
when
i
did
all
the
work
the
old
skinflint
and
what
else
have
i
got
to
do
like
to
take
a
good
long
vacation
motor
trip
he
sprang
up
rekindled
by
the
thought
of
lunching
with
paul
riesling
chapter
v
babbitt
preparations
for
leaving
the
office
to
its
feeble
self
during
the
hour
and
a
half
of
his
were
somewhat
less
elaborate
than
the
plans
for
a
general
european
war
he
fretted
to
miss
mcgoun
what
time
you
going
to
lunch
well
make
sure
miss
bannigan
is
in
then
explain
to
her
that
if
wiedenfeldt
calls
up
she
to
tell
him
i
already
having
the
title
traced
and
oh
b
the
way
remind
me
to
have
penniman
trace
it
now
if
anybody
comes
in
looking
for
a
cheap
house
remember
we
got
to
shove
that
bangor
road
place
off
onto
somebody
if
you
need
me
i
be
at
the
athletic
club
and
uh
and
uh
i
be
back
by
he
dusted
the
off
his
vest
he
placed
a
difficult
unanswered
letter
on
the
pile
of
unfinished
work
that
he
might
not
fail
to
attend
to
it
that
afternoon
for
three
noons
now
he
had
placed
the
same
letter
on
the
unfinished
pile
he
scrawled
on
a
sheet
of
yellow
the
memorandum
see
abt
apt
h
drs
which
gave
him
an
agreeable
feeling
of
having
already
seen
about
the
doors
he
discovered
that
he
was
smoking
another
cigar
he
threw
it
away
protesting
darn
it
i
thought
you
quit
this
darn
smoking
he
courageously
returned
the
to
the
locked
it
up
hid
the
key
in
a
more
difficult
place
and
raged
ought
to
take
care
of
myself
and
need
more
exercise
walk
to
the
club
every
single
noon
just
what
i
do
every
noon
cut
out
this
motoring
all
the
the
resolution
made
him
feel
exemplary
immediately
after
it
he
decided
that
this
noon
it
was
too
late
to
walk
it
took
but
little
more
time
to
start
his
car
and
edge
it
into
the
traffic
than
it
would
have
taken
to
walk
the
three
and
a
half
blocks
to
the
club
ii
as
he
drove
he
glanced
with
the
fondness
of
familiarity
at
the
buildings
a
stranger
suddenly
dropped
into
the
of
zenith
could
not
have
told
whether
he
was
in
a
city
of
oregon
or
georgia
ohio
or
maine
oklahoma
or
manitoba
but
to
babbitt
every
inch
was
individual
and
stirring
as
always
he
noted
that
the
california
building
across
the
way
was
three
stories
lower
therefore
three
stories
less
beautiful
than
his
own
reeves
building
as
always
when
he
passed
the
parthenon
shoe
shine
parlor
a
hut
which
beside
the
granite
and
ponderousness
of
the
old
california
building
resembled
a
under
a
cliff
he
commented
gosh
ought
to
get
my
shoes
shined
this
afternoon
keep
forgetting
at
the
simplex
office
furniture
shop
the
national
cash
register
agency
he
yearned
for
a
dictaphone
for
a
typewriter
which
would
add
and
multiply
as
a
poet
yearns
for
quartos
or
a
physician
for
radium
at
the
nobby
men
wear
shop
he
took
his
left
hand
off
the
to
touch
his
scarf
and
thought
well
of
himself
as
one
who
bought
expensive
ties
and
could
pay
cash
for
too
by
golly
and
at
the
united
cigar
store
with
its
crimson
and
gold
alertness
he
reflected
wonder
if
i
need
some
cigars
idiot
plumb
forgot
going
t
cut
down
my
fool
he
looked
at
his
bank
the
miners
and
drovers
national
and
considered
how
clever
and
solid
he
was
to
bank
with
so
marbled
an
establishment
his
high
moment
came
in
the
clash
of
traffic
when
he
was
halted
at
the
corner
beneath
the
lofty
second
national
tower
his
car
was
banked
with
four
others
in
a
line
of
steel
restless
as
cavalry
while
the
cross
town
traffic
limousines
and
enormous
and
insistent
poured
by
on
the
farther
corner
pneumatic
riveters
rang
on
the
skeleton
of
a
new
building
and
out
of
this
tornado
flashed
the
inspiration
of
a
familiar
face
and
a
fellow
booster
shouted
h
are
you
george
babbitt
waved
in
neighborly
affection
and
slid
on
with
the
traffic
as
the
policeman
lifted
his
hand
he
noted
how
quickly
his
car
picked
up
he
felt
superior
and
powerful
like
a
shuttle
of
polished
steel
darting
in
a
vast
machine
as
always
he
ignored
the
next
two
blocks
decayed
blocks
not
yet
reclaimed
from
the
grime
and
shabbiness
of
the
zenith
of
while
he
was
passing
the
store
the
dakota
lodging
house
concordia
hall
with
its
and
the
offices
of
and
chiropractors
he
thought
of
how
much
money
he
made
and
he
boasted
a
little
and
worried
a
little
and
did
old
familiar
sums
four
hundred
fifty
plunks
this
morning
from
the
lyte
deal
but
taxes
due
let
see
i
ought
to
pull
out
eight
thousand
net
this
year
and
save
fifteen
hundred
of
that
no
not
if
i
put
up
garage
and
see
six
hundred
and
forty
clear
last
month
and
twelve
times
makes
makes
let
see
six
times
twelve
is
hundred
and
oh
rats
anyway
i
make
eight
thousand
gee
now
that
not
so
bad
mighty
few
fellows
pulling
down
eight
thousand
dollars
a
year
eight
thousand
good
hard
iron
dollars
bet
there
is
more
than
five
per
cent
of
the
people
in
the
whole
united
states
that
make
more
than
uncle
george
does
by
golly
right
up
at
the
top
of
the
heap
but
way
expenses
are
family
wasting
gasoline
and
always
dressed
like
millionaires
and
sending
that
eighty
a
month
to
mother
and
all
these
stenographers
and
salesmen
gouging
me
for
every
cent
they
can
get
the
effect
of
his
scientific
was
that
he
felt
at
once
triumphantly
wealthy
and
perilously
poor
and
in
the
midst
of
these
dissertations
he
stopped
his
car
rushed
into
a
small
shop
and
bought
the
electric
which
he
had
coveted
for
a
week
he
dodged
his
conscience
by
being
jerky
and
noisy
and
by
shouting
at
the
clerk
guess
this
will
prett
near
pay
for
itself
in
matches
eh
it
was
a
pretty
thing
a
nickeled
cylinder
with
an
almost
silvery
socket
to
be
attached
to
the
dashboard
of
his
car
it
was
not
only
as
the
placard
on
the
counter
observed
a
dandy
little
refinement
lending
the
last
touch
of
class
to
a
gentleman
auto
but
a
priceless
by
freeing
him
from
halting
the
car
to
light
a
match
it
would
in
a
month
or
two
easily
save
ten
minutes
as
he
drove
on
he
glanced
at
it
pretty
nice
always
wanted
one
he
said
wistfully
the
one
thing
a
smoker
needs
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
given
up
smoking
darn
it
he
mourned
oh
well
i
suppose
i
hit
a
cigar
once
in
a
while
and
be
a
great
convenience
for
other
folks
might
make
just
the
difference
in
getting
chummy
with
some
fellow
that
would
put
over
a
sale
and
certainly
looks
nice
there
certainly
is
a
mighty
clever
little
jigger
gives
the
last
touch
of
refinement
and
class
i
by
golly
i
guess
i
can
afford
it
if
i
want
to
not
going
to
be
the
only
member
of
this
family
that
never
has
a
single
doggone
luxury
thus
laden
with
treasure
after
three
and
a
half
blocks
of
romantic
adventure
he
drove
up
to
the
club
iii
the
zenith
athletic
club
is
not
athletic
and
it
is
exactly
a
club
but
it
is
zenith
in
perfection
it
has
an
active
and
billiard
room
it
is
represented
by
baseball
and
football
teams
and
in
the
pool
and
the
gymnasium
a
tenth
of
the
members
sporadically
try
to
reduce
but
most
of
its
three
thousand
members
use
it
as
a
cafe
in
which
to
lunch
play
cards
tell
stories
meet
customers
and
entertain
town
uncles
at
dinner
it
is
the
largest
club
in
the
city
and
its
chief
hatred
is
the
conservative
union
club
which
all
sound
members
of
the
athletic
call
a
rotten
snobbish
dull
expensive
old
hole
not
one
good
mixer
in
the
place
you
could
hire
me
to
statistics
show
that
no
member
of
the
athletic
has
ever
refused
election
to
the
union
and
of
those
who
are
elected
per
cent
resign
from
the
athletic
and
are
thereafter
heard
to
say
in
the
drowsy
sanctity
of
the
union
lounge
the
athletic
would
be
a
pretty
good
hotel
if
it
were
more
the
athletic
club
building
is
nine
stories
high
yellow
brick
with
glassy
above
and
portico
of
huge
limestone
columns
below
the
lobby
with
its
thick
pillars
of
porous
caen
stone
its
pointed
vaulting
and
a
brown
floor
like
is
a
combination
of
and
rathskellar
the
members
rush
into
the
lobby
as
though
they
were
shopping
and
had
much
time
for
it
thus
did
babbitt
enter
and
to
the
group
standing
by
the
he
whooped
how
the
boys
how
the
boys
well
well
fine
day
jovially
they
whooped
back
vergil
gunch
the
sidney
finkelstein
the
buyer
for
parcher
and
professor
joseph
pumphrey
owner
of
the
riteway
business
college
and
instructor
in
public
speaking
business
english
scenario
writing
and
commercial
law
though
babbitt
admired
this
savant
and
appreciated
sidney
finkelstein
as
a
mighty
smart
buyer
and
a
good
liberal
spender
it
was
to
vergil
gunch
that
he
turned
with
enthusiasm
gunch
was
president
of
the
boosters
club
a
weekly
local
chapter
of
a
national
organization
which
promoted
sound
business
and
friendliness
among
regular
fellows
he
was
also
no
less
an
official
than
esteemed
leading
knight
in
the
benevolent
and
protective
order
of
elks
and
it
was
rumored
that
at
the
next
election
he
would
be
a
candidate
for
exalted
ruler
he
was
a
jolly
man
given
to
oratory
and
to
chumminess
with
the
arts
he
called
on
the
famous
actors
and
vaudeville
artists
when
they
came
to
town
gave
them
cigars
addressed
them
by
their
first
names
and
sometimes
succeeded
in
bringing
them
to
the
boosters
lunches
to
give
the
boys
a
free
entertainment
he
was
a
large
man
with
hair
en
brosse
and
he
knew
the
latest
jokes
but
he
played
poker
close
to
the
chest
it
was
at
his
party
that
babbitt
had
sucked
in
the
virus
of
restlessness
gunch
shouted
how
the
old
bolsheviki
how
do
you
feel
the
morning
after
the
night
before
oh
boy
some
head
that
was
a
regular
party
you
threw
verg
hope
you
have
forgotten
i
took
that
last
cute
little
babbitt
bellowed
he
was
three
feet
from
gunch
that
all
right
now
what
i
hand
you
next
time
georgie
say
juh
notice
in
the
paper
the
way
the
new
york
assembly
stood
up
to
the
reds
you
bet
i
did
that
was
fine
eh
nice
day
yes
it
one
mighty
fine
spring
day
but
nights
still
yeh
you
right
they
are
had
to
have
coupla
blankets
last
night
out
on
the
say
sid
babbitt
turned
to
finkelstein
the
buyer
got
something
wanta
ask
you
about
i
went
out
and
bought
me
an
electric
for
the
car
this
noon
and
good
hunch
said
finkelstein
while
even
the
learned
professor
pumphrey
a
bulbous
man
with
a
cutaway
and
a
voice
commented
that
makes
a
dandy
accessory
gives
tone
to
the
yep
finally
decided
i
buy
me
one
got
the
best
on
the
market
the
clerk
said
it
was
paid
five
bucks
for
it
just
wondering
if
i
got
stuck
what
do
they
charge
for
at
the
store
sid
finkelstein
asserted
that
five
dollars
was
not
too
great
a
sum
not
for
a
really
lighter
which
was
suitably
nickeled
and
provided
with
connections
of
the
very
best
quality
i
always
say
and
believe
me
i
base
it
on
a
pretty
fairly
extensive
mercantile
experience
the
best
is
the
cheapest
in
the
long
run
of
course
if
a
fellow
wants
to
be
a
jew
about
it
he
can
get
cheap
junk
but
in
the
long
run
the
cheapest
thing
is
the
best
you
can
get
now
you
take
here
just
th
other
day
i
got
a
new
top
for
my
old
boat
and
some
upholstery
and
i
paid
out
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
of
course
a
lot
of
fellows
would
say
that
was
too
much
lord
if
the
old
folks
they
live
in
one
of
these
hick
towns
and
they
simply
ca
get
onto
the
way
a
city
fellow
mind
works
and
then
of
course
they
jews
and
lie
right
down
and
die
if
they
knew
sid
had
anted
up
a
hundred
and
bones
but
i
do
figure
i
was
stuck
george
not
a
bit
machine
looks
brand
new
now
not
that
it
so
darned
old
of
course
had
it
less
three
years
but
i
give
it
hard
service
never
drive
less
a
hundred
miles
on
sunday
and
uh
oh
i
do
really
think
you
got
stuck
george
in
the
long
run
the
best
is
you
might
say
unquestionably
the
that
right
said
vergil
gunch
that
the
way
i
look
at
it
if
a
fellow
is
keyed
up
to
what
you
might
call
intensive
living
the
way
you
get
it
here
in
zenith
all
the
hustle
and
mental
activity
that
going
on
with
a
bunch
of
like
the
boosters
and
here
in
the
why
he
got
to
save
his
nerves
by
having
the
babbitt
nodded
his
head
at
every
fifth
word
in
the
roaring
rhythm
and
by
the
conclusion
in
gunch
renowned
humorous
vein
he
was
enchanted
still
at
that
george
do
know
you
can
afford
it
i
heard
your
business
has
been
kind
of
under
the
eye
of
the
since
you
stole
the
tail
of
eathorne
park
and
sold
it
oh
you
a
great
little
josher
verg
but
when
it
comes
to
kidding
how
about
this
report
that
you
stole
the
black
marble
steps
off
the
and
sold
for
coal
in
delight
babbitt
patted
gunch
back
stroked
his
arm
that
all
right
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
who
the
shark
that
bought
that
coal
for
his
i
guess
that
hold
you
for
a
while
george
said
finkelstein
tell
you
though
boys
what
i
did
hear
george
missus
went
into
the
gents
wear
department
at
parcher
to
buy
him
some
collars
and
before
she
could
give
his
the
clerk
slips
her
some
thirteens
juh
know
the
size
says
babbitt
and
the
clerk
says
that
let
their
wives
buy
collars
for
always
wear
thirteen
madam
that
that
pretty
good
eh
how
that
eh
i
guess
that
about
fix
you
george
i
i
babbitt
sought
for
amiable
insults
in
answer
he
stopped
stared
at
the
door
paul
riesling
was
coming
in
babbitt
cried
see
you
later
boys
and
hastened
across
the
lobby
he
was
just
then
neither
the
sulky
child
of
the
the
domestic
tyrant
of
the
breakfast
table
the
crafty
of
the
conference
nor
the
blaring
good
fellow
the
josher
and
regular
guy
of
the
athletic
club
he
was
an
older
brother
to
paul
riesling
swift
to
defend
him
admiring
him
with
a
proud
and
credulous
love
passing
the
love
of
women
paul
and
he
shook
hands
solemnly
they
smiled
as
shyly
as
though
they
had
been
parted
three
years
not
three
days
and
they
said
how
the
old
all
right
i
guess
how
you
you
poor
shrimp
i
you
hunk
o
reassured
thus
of
their
high
fondness
babbitt
grunted
you
a
fine
guy
you
are
ten
minutes
late
riesling
snapped
well
you
lucky
to
have
a
chance
to
lunch
with
a
gentleman
they
grinned
and
went
into
the
neronian
washroom
where
a
line
of
men
bent
over
the
bowls
inset
along
a
prodigious
slab
of
marble
as
in
religious
prostration
before
their
own
images
in
the
massy
mirror
voices
thick
satisfied
authoritative
hurtled
along
the
marble
walls
bounded
from
the
ceiling
of
milky
tiles
while
the
lords
of
the
city
the
barons
of
insurance
and
law
and
fertilizers
and
motor
tires
laid
down
the
law
for
zenith
announced
that
the
day
was
indisputably
of
spring
that
wages
were
too
high
and
the
interest
on
mortgages
too
low
that
babe
ruth
the
eminent
player
of
baseball
was
a
noble
man
and
that
those
two
nuts
at
the
climax
vaudeville
theater
this
week
certainly
are
a
slick
pair
of
babbitt
though
ordinarily
his
voice
was
the
surest
and
most
episcopal
of
all
was
silent
in
the
presence
of
the
slight
dark
reticence
of
paul
riesling
he
was
awkward
he
desired
to
be
quiet
and
firm
and
deft
the
entrance
lobby
of
the
athletic
club
was
gothic
the
washroom
roman
imperial
the
lounge
spanish
mission
and
the
in
chinese
chippendale
but
the
gem
of
the
club
was
the
the
masterpiece
of
ferdinand
reitman
zenith
busiest
architect
it
was
lofty
and
with
tudor
leaded
casements
an
oriel
a
somewhat
musicianless
and
tapestries
believed
to
illustrate
the
granting
of
magna
charta
the
open
beams
had
been
at
jake
offutt
works
the
hinge
were
of
iron
the
wainscot
studded
with
handmade
wooden
pegs
and
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
heraldic
and
hooded
stone
fireplace
which
the
club
asserted
to
be
not
only
larger
than
any
of
the
fireplaces
in
european
castles
but
of
a
draught
incomparably
more
scientific
it
was
also
much
cleaner
as
no
fire
had
ever
been
built
in
it
half
of
the
tables
were
mammoth
slabs
which
seated
twenty
or
thirty
men
babbitt
usually
sat
at
the
one
near
the
door
with
a
group
including
gunch
finkelstein
professor
pumphrey
howard
littlefield
his
neighbor
cholmondeley
frink
the
poet
and
and
orville
jones
whose
laundry
was
in
many
ways
the
best
in
zenith
they
composed
a
club
within
the
club
and
merrily
called
themselves
the
as
he
passed
their
table
the
roughnecks
greeted
him
come
on
sit
in
you
paul
too
proud
to
feed
with
poor
folks
afraid
somebody
might
stick
you
for
a
bottle
of
bevo
george
strikes
me
you
swells
are
getting
awful
darn
exclusive
he
thundered
you
bet
we
ca
afford
to
have
our
reps
ruined
by
being
seen
with
you
tightwads
and
guided
paul
to
one
of
the
small
tables
beneath
the
he
felt
guilty
at
the
zenith
athletic
club
privacy
was
very
bad
form
but
he
wanted
paul
to
himself
that
morning
he
had
advocated
lighter
lunches
and
now
he
ordered
nothing
but
english
mutton
chop
radishes
peas
apple
pie
a
bit
of
cheese
and
a
pot
of
coffee
with
cream
adding
as
he
did
invariably
and
uh
oh
and
you
might
give
me
an
order
of
french
fried
when
the
chop
came
he
vigorously
peppered
it
and
salted
it
he
always
peppered
and
salted
his
meat
and
vigorously
before
tasting
it
paul
and
he
took
up
the
quality
of
the
spring
the
virtues
of
the
electric
and
the
action
of
the
new
york
state
assembly
it
was
not
till
babbitt
was
thick
and
disconsolate
with
mutton
grease
that
he
flung
out
i
wound
up
a
nice
little
deal
with
conrad
lyte
this
morning
that
put
five
hundred
good
round
plunks
in
my
pocket
pretty
nice
pretty
nice
and
yet
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
maybe
it
an
attack
of
spring
fever
or
staying
up
too
late
at
verg
gunch
or
maybe
it
just
the
winter
work
piling
up
but
i
felt
kind
of
down
in
the
mouth
all
day
long
course
i
would
beef
about
it
to
the
fellows
at
the
roughnecks
table
there
but
you
ever
feel
that
way
paul
kind
of
comes
over
me
here
i
pretty
much
done
all
the
things
i
ought
to
supported
my
family
and
got
a
good
house
and
a
car
and
built
up
a
nice
little
business
and
i
have
any
vices
except
smoking
and
i
practically
cutting
that
out
by
the
way
and
i
belong
to
the
church
and
play
enough
golf
to
keep
in
trim
and
i
only
associate
with
good
decent
fellows
and
yet
even
so
i
do
know
that
i
entirely
satisfied
it
was
drawled
out
broken
by
shouts
from
the
neighboring
tables
by
mechanical
to
the
waitress
by
stertorous
grunts
as
the
coffee
filled
him
with
dizziness
and
indigestion
he
was
apologetic
and
doubtful
and
it
was
paul
with
his
thin
voice
who
pierced
the
fog
good
lord
george
you
do
suppose
it
any
novelty
to
me
to
find
that
we
hustlers
that
think
we
so
successful
getting
much
out
of
it
you
look
as
if
you
expected
me
to
report
you
as
seditious
you
know
what
my
own
life
i
know
old
i
ought
to
have
been
a
fiddler
and
i
a
pedler
of
and
zilla
oh
i
do
want
to
squeal
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
about
how
inspiring
a
wife
she
is
typical
instance
last
evening
we
went
to
the
movies
there
was
a
big
crowd
waiting
in
the
lobby
us
at
the
she
began
to
push
right
through
it
with
her
how
dare
you
manner
honestly
sometimes
when
i
look
at
her
and
see
how
always
so
made
up
and
stinking
of
perfume
and
looking
for
trouble
and
kind
of
always
yelping
tell
yuh
i
a
lady
damn
yuh
why
i
want
to
kill
her
well
she
keeps
elbowing
through
the
crowd
me
after
her
feeling
good
and
ashamed
till
she
almost
up
to
the
velvet
rope
and
ready
to
be
the
next
let
in
but
there
was
a
little
squirt
of
a
man
there
probably
been
waiting
half
an
hour
i
kind
of
admired
the
little
cuss
and
he
turns
on
zilla
and
says
perfectly
polite
why
are
you
trying
to
push
past
me
and
she
simply
god
i
was
so
ashamed
she
rips
out
at
him
no
gentleman
and
she
drags
me
into
it
and
hollers
this
person
insulted
me
and
the
poor
skate
he
got
ready
to
fight
i
made
out
i
had
heard
them
sure
same
as
you
would
hear
a
and
i
tried
to
look
away
i
can
tell
you
exactly
how
every
tile
looks
in
the
ceiling
of
that
lobby
there
one
with
brown
spots
on
it
like
the
face
of
the
devil
and
all
the
time
the
people
there
they
were
packed
in
like
sardines
they
kept
making
remarks
about
us
and
zilla
went
right
on
talking
about
the
little
chap
and
screeching
that
like
him
ought
to
be
admitted
in
a
place
that
supposed
to
be
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
will
you
kindly
call
the
manager
so
i
can
report
this
dirty
rat
and
oof
maybe
i
was
glad
when
i
could
sneak
inside
and
hide
in
the
dark
after
years
of
that
kind
of
thing
you
do
expect
me
to
fall
down
and
foam
at
the
mouth
when
you
hint
that
this
sweet
clean
respectable
moral
life
is
all
it
cracked
up
to
be
do
you
i
even
talk
about
it
except
to
you
because
anybody
else
would
think
i
was
yellow
maybe
i
am
do
care
any
longer
gosh
you
had
to
stand
a
lot
of
whining
from
me
first
and
last
georgie
rats
now
paul
you
never
really
what
you
could
call
whined
sometimes
i
always
blowing
to
myra
and
the
kids
about
what
a
whale
of
a
realtor
i
am
and
yet
sometimes
i
get
a
sneaking
idea
i
not
such
a
pierpont
morgan
as
i
let
on
to
be
but
if
i
ever
do
help
by
jollying
you
along
old
paulski
i
guess
maybe
saint
pete
may
let
me
in
after
all
yuh
you
an
old
georgie
you
cheerful
but
you
certainly
kept
me
why
do
you
divorce
zilla
why
do
i
if
i
only
could
if
she
just
give
me
the
chance
you
could
hire
her
to
divorce
me
no
nor
desert
me
she
too
fond
of
her
three
squares
and
a
few
pounds
of
chocolates
in
between
if
she
only
be
what
they
call
unfaithful
to
me
george
i
do
want
to
be
too
much
of
a
stinker
back
in
college
i
thought
a
man
who
could
say
that
ought
to
be
shot
at
sunrise
but
honestly
i
be
tickled
to
death
if
she
really
go
making
love
with
somebody
fat
chance
of
course
she
flirt
with
anything
you
know
how
she
holds
hands
and
laughs
that
laugh
that
horrible
brassy
laugh
the
way
she
yaps
naughty
man
you
better
be
careful
or
my
big
husband
will
be
after
you
and
the
guy
looking
me
over
and
thinking
you
cute
little
thing
you
run
away
now
or
i
spank
you
and
she
let
him
go
just
far
enough
so
she
gets
some
excitement
out
of
it
and
then
she
begin
to
do
the
injured
innocent
and
have
a
beautiful
time
wailing
did
think
you
were
that
kind
of
a
person
they
talk
about
these
in
stories
these
whats
but
the
wise
hard
corseted
old
married
women
like
zilla
are
worse
than
any
girl
that
ever
went
boldly
out
into
storm
of
life
and
kept
her
umbrella
slid
up
her
sleeve
but
rats
you
know
what
zilla
is
how
she
nags
nags
nags
how
she
wants
everything
i
can
buy
her
and
a
lot
that
i
ca
and
how
absolutely
unreasonable
she
is
and
when
i
get
sore
and
try
to
have
it
out
with
her
she
plays
the
perfect
lady
so
well
that
even
i
get
fooled
and
get
all
tangled
up
in
a
lot
of
did
you
say
and
did
mean
i
tell
you
georgie
you
know
my
tastes
are
pretty
fairly
simple
in
the
matter
of
food
at
least
course
as
you
always
complaining
i
do
like
decent
cigars
not
those
flor
de
cabagos
you
smoking
that
all
right
now
that
a
good
by
the
way
paul
did
i
tell
you
i
decided
to
practically
cut
out
smok
yes
you
at
the
same
time
if
i
ca
get
what
i
like
why
i
can
do
without
it
i
do
mind
sitting
down
to
burnt
steak
with
canned
peaches
and
store
cake
for
a
thrilling
little
dessert
afterwards
but
i
do
draw
the
line
at
having
to
sympathize
with
zilla
because
so
rotten
that
the
cook
has
quit
and
she
been
so
busy
sitting
in
a
dirty
lace
negligee
all
afternoon
reading
about
some
brave
manly
western
hero
that
she
has
had
time
to
do
any
cooking
always
talking
about
meaning
monogamy
i
suppose
you
been
the
rock
of
ages
to
me
all
right
but
you
essentially
a
simp
you
where
d
you
get
that
little
man
let
me
tell
you
love
to
look
earnest
and
inform
the
world
that
it
the
of
responsible
business
men
to
be
strictly
moral
as
an
example
to
the
community
in
fact
you
so
earnest
about
morality
old
georgie
that
i
hate
to
think
how
essentially
immoral
you
must
be
underneath
all
right
you
can
wait
wait
now
what
talk
about
morals
all
you
want
to
old
thing
but
believe
me
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
an
occasional
evening
playing
the
violin
to
terrill
and
three
or
four
darling
girls
that
let
me
forget
this
beastly
joke
they
call
life
i
killed
myself
years
ago
and
business
the
roofing
business
roofs
for
cowsheds
oh
i
mean
i
have
had
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
the
game
out
of
putting
it
over
on
the
labor
unions
and
seeing
a
big
check
coming
in
and
the
business
increasing
but
what
the
use
of
it
you
know
my
business
distributing
roofing
it
principally
keeping
my
competitors
from
distributing
roofing
same
with
you
all
we
do
is
cut
each
throats
and
make
the
public
pay
for
it
look
here
now
paul
you
pretty
darn
near
talking
socialism
oh
yes
of
course
i
do
really
exactly
mean
that
i
course
competition
brings
out
the
best
survival
of
the
fittest
but
but
i
mean
take
all
these
fellows
we
know
the
kind
right
here
in
the
club
now
that
seem
to
be
perfectly
content
with
their
and
their
businesses
and
that
boost
zenith
and
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
holler
for
a
million
population
i
bet
if
you
could
cut
into
their
heads
you
find
that
of
are
satisfied
with
their
wives
and
kids
and
friends
and
their
offices
and
feel
kind
of
restless
but
wo
admit
it
and
are
miserable
and
know
it
they
hate
the
whole
peppy
boosting
game
and
they
bored
by
their
wives
and
think
their
families
are
fools
at
least
when
they
come
to
forty
or
they
bored
and
they
hate
business
and
they
go
why
do
you
suppose
there
so
many
suicides
why
do
you
suppose
so
many
substantial
citizens
jumped
right
into
the
war
think
it
was
all
patriotism
babbitt
snorted
what
do
you
expect
think
we
were
sent
into
the
world
to
have
a
soft
time
and
what
is
it
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
think
man
was
just
made
to
be
happy
why
not
though
i
never
discovered
anybody
that
knew
what
the
deuce
man
really
was
made
for
well
we
know
not
just
in
the
bible
alone
but
it
stands
to
reason
a
man
who
does
buckle
down
and
do
his
duty
even
if
it
does
bore
him
sometimes
is
nothing
but
a
well
he
simply
a
weakling
mollycoddle
in
fact
and
what
do
you
advocate
come
down
to
cases
if
a
man
is
bored
by
his
wife
do
you
seriously
mean
he
has
a
right
to
chuck
her
and
take
a
sneak
or
even
kill
himself
good
lord
i
do
know
what
a
man
has
and
i
do
know
the
solution
of
boredom
if
i
did
i
be
the
one
philosopher
that
had
the
cure
for
living
but
i
do
know
that
about
ten
times
as
many
people
find
their
lives
dull
and
unnecessarily
dull
as
ever
admit
it
and
i
do
believe
that
if
we
busted
out
and
admitted
it
sometimes
instead
of
being
nice
and
patient
and
loyal
for
sixty
years
and
then
nice
and
patient
and
dead
for
the
rest
of
eternity
why
maybe
possibly
we
might
make
life
more
they
drifted
into
a
maze
of
speculation
babbitt
was
elephantishly
uneasy
paul
was
bold
but
not
quite
sure
about
what
he
was
being
bold
now
and
then
babbitt
suddenly
agreed
with
paul
in
an
admission
which
contradicted
all
his
defense
of
duty
and
christian
patience
and
at
each
admission
he
had
a
curious
reckless
joy
he
said
at
last
look
here
old
paul
you
do
a
lot
of
talking
about
kicking
things
in
the
face
but
you
never
kick
why
do
you
nobody
does
habit
too
strong
but
georgie
i
been
thinking
of
one
mild
bat
oh
do
worry
old
pillar
of
monogamy
it
highly
proper
it
seems
to
be
settled
now
is
it
though
of
course
zilla
keeps
rooting
for
a
nice
expensive
vacation
in
new
york
and
atlantic
city
with
the
bright
lights
and
the
bootlegged
cocktails
and
a
bunch
of
to
dance
with
but
the
babbitts
and
the
rieslings
are
going
to
lake
sunasquam
are
we
why
could
you
and
i
make
some
excuse
say
business
in
new
york
and
get
up
to
maine
four
or
five
days
before
they
do
and
just
loaf
by
ourselves
and
smoke
and
cuss
and
be
natural
great
great
idea
babbitt
admired
not
for
fourteen
years
had
he
taken
a
holiday
without
his
wife
and
neither
of
them
quite
believed
they
could
commit
this
audacity
many
members
of
the
athletic
club
did
go
camping
without
their
wives
but
they
were
officially
dedicated
to
fishing
and
hunting
whereas
the
sacred
and
unchangeable
sports
of
babbitt
and
paul
riesling
were
golfing
motoring
and
bridge
for
either
the
fishermen
or
the
golfers
to
have
changed
their
habits
would
have
been
an
infraction
of
their
discipline
which
would
have
shocked
all
and
regularized
citizens
babbitt
blustered
why
do
we
just
put
our
foot
down
and
say
going
on
ahead
of
you
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
nothing
criminal
in
it
simply
say
to
zilla
you
do
say
anything
to
zilla
simply
why
georgie
she
almost
as
much
of
a
moralist
as
you
are
and
if
i
told
her
the
truth
she
believe
we
were
going
to
meet
some
dames
in
new
york
and
even
myra
she
never
nags
you
the
way
zilla
does
but
she
worry
she
say
you
want
me
to
go
to
maine
with
you
i
should
dream
of
going
unless
you
wanted
me
and
you
give
in
to
save
her
feelings
oh
the
devil
have
a
shot
at
during
the
game
of
a
juvenile
form
of
bowling
paul
was
silent
as
they
came
down
the
steps
of
the
club
not
more
than
half
an
hour
after
the
time
at
which
babbitt
had
sternly
told
miss
mcgoun
he
would
be
back
paul
sighed
look
here
old
man
ought
to
talked
about
zilla
way
i
rats
old
man
it
lets
off
oh
i
know
after
spending
all
noon
sneering
at
the
conventional
stuff
i
conventional
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
saving
my
life
by
busting
out
with
my
fool
troubles
old
paul
your
nerves
are
kind
of
on
the
bum
i
going
to
take
you
away
i
going
to
rig
this
thing
i
going
to
have
an
important
deal
in
new
york
and
and
sure
of
course
i
need
you
to
advise
me
on
the
roof
of
the
building
and
the
ole
deal
will
fall
through
and
be
nothing
for
us
but
to
go
on
ahead
to
maine
i
paul
when
it
comes
right
down
to
it
i
do
care
whether
you
bust
loose
or
not
i
do
like
having
a
rep
for
being
one
of
the
bunch
but
if
you
ever
needed
me
i
chuck
it
and
come
out
for
you
every
time
not
of
course
but
what
you
course
i
do
mean
you
ever
do
anything
that
would
put
that
would
put
a
decent
position
on
the
fritz
but
see
how
i
mean
i
kind
of
a
clumsy
old
codger
and
i
need
your
fine
eyetalian
hand
we
oh
hell
i
ca
stand
here
gassing
all
day
on
the
job
s
long
take
any
wooden
money
paulibus
see
you
soon
s
long
chapter
vi
i
he
forgot
paul
riesling
in
an
afternoon
of
not
unagreeable
details
after
a
return
to
his
office
which
seemed
to
have
staggered
on
without
him
he
drove
a
prospect
out
to
view
a
tenement
in
the
linton
district
he
was
inspired
by
the
customer
admiration
of
the
new
thrice
its
novelty
made
him
use
it
and
thrice
he
hurled
cigarettes
from
the
car
protesting
i
got
to
quit
smoking
so
blame
much
their
ample
discussion
of
every
detail
of
the
led
them
to
speak
of
electric
and
babbitt
apologized
for
being
so
shabbily
as
still
to
use
a
bottle
and
he
announced
that
he
would
have
the
wired
at
once
he
had
enormous
and
poetic
admiration
though
very
little
understanding
of
all
mechanical
devices
they
were
his
symbols
of
truth
and
beauty
regarding
each
new
intricate
mechanism
metal
lathe
carburetor
machine
gun
oxyacetylene
welder
he
learned
one
good
phrase
and
used
it
over
and
over
with
a
delightful
feeling
of
being
technical
and
initiated
the
customer
joined
him
in
the
worship
of
machinery
and
they
came
buoyantly
up
to
the
tenement
and
began
that
examination
of
plastic
slate
roof
kalamein
doors
and
flooring
began
those
diplomacies
of
hurt
surprise
and
readiness
to
be
persuaded
to
do
something
they
had
already
decided
to
do
which
would
some
day
result
in
a
sale
on
the
way
back
babbitt
picked
up
his
partner
and
henry
thompson
at
his
works
and
they
drove
through
south
zenith
a
banging
exciting
region
new
factories
of
hollow
tile
with
gigantic
windows
surly
old
factories
stained
with
tar
big
red
trucks
like
locomotives
and
on
a
score
of
hectic
from
the
new
york
central
and
apple
orchards
the
great
northern
and
the
southern
pacific
and
orange
groves
they
talked
to
the
secretary
of
the
zenith
foundry
company
about
an
interesting
artistic
project
a
fence
for
linden
lane
cemetery
they
drove
on
to
the
zeeco
motor
company
and
interviewed
the
noel
ryland
about
a
discount
on
a
zeeco
car
for
thompson
babbitt
and
ryland
were
of
the
boosters
club
and
no
booster
felt
right
if
he
bought
anything
from
another
booster
without
receiving
a
discount
but
henry
thompson
growled
oh
t
hell
with
i
not
going
to
crawl
around
mooching
discounts
not
from
it
was
one
of
the
differences
between
thompson
the
lean
yankee
rugged
traditional
stage
type
of
american
business
man
and
babbitt
the
plump
smooth
efficient
and
otherwise
perfected
modern
whenever
thompson
twanged
put
your
john
hancock
on
that
line
babbitt
was
as
much
amused
by
the
antiquated
provincialism
as
any
proper
englishman
by
any
american
he
knew
himself
to
be
of
a
breeding
altogether
more
esthetic
and
sensitive
than
thompson
he
was
a
college
graduate
he
played
golf
he
often
smoked
cigarettes
instead
of
cigars
and
when
he
went
to
chicago
he
took
a
room
with
a
private
bath
the
whole
thing
is
he
explained
to
paul
riesling
these
old
codgers
lack
the
subtlety
that
you
got
to
have
this
advance
in
civilization
could
be
carried
too
far
babbitt
perceived
noel
ryland
of
the
zeeco
was
a
frivolous
graduate
of
princeton
while
babbitt
was
a
sound
and
standard
ware
from
that
great
the
state
university
ryland
wore
spats
he
wrote
long
letters
about
city
planning
and
community
singing
and
though
he
was
a
booster
he
was
known
to
carry
in
his
pocket
small
volumes
of
poetry
in
a
foreign
language
all
this
was
going
too
far
henry
thompson
was
the
extreme
of
insularity
and
noel
ryland
the
extreme
of
frothiness
while
between
them
supporting
the
state
defending
the
evangelical
churches
and
domestic
brightness
and
sound
business
were
babbitt
and
his
friends
with
this
just
estimate
of
himself
and
with
the
promise
of
a
discount
on
thompson
car
he
returned
to
his
office
in
triumph
but
as
he
went
through
the
corridor
of
the
reeves
building
he
sighed
poor
old
paul
i
got
to
oh
damn
noel
ryland
damn
charley
mckelvey
just
because
they
make
more
money
than
i
do
they
think
they
so
superior
i
would
be
found
dead
in
their
stuffy
old
union
club
i
somehow
i
do
feel
like
going
back
to
work
oh
well
ii
he
answered
telephone
calls
he
read
the
four
mail
he
signed
his
morning
letters
he
talked
to
a
tenant
about
repairs
he
fought
with
stanley
graff
young
graff
the
outside
salesman
was
always
hinting
that
he
deserved
an
increase
of
commission
and
he
complained
i
think
i
ought
to
get
a
bonus
if
i
put
through
the
heiler
sale
i
chasing
around
and
working
on
it
every
single
evening
babbitt
frequently
remarked
to
his
wife
that
it
was
better
to
con
your
along
and
keep
happy
of
jumping
on
and
poking
up
get
more
work
out
of
that
way
but
this
unexampled
lack
of
appreciation
hurt
him
and
he
turned
on
graff
look
here
stan
let
get
this
clear
you
got
an
idea
somehow
that
it
you
that
do
all
the
selling
where
d
you
get
that
stuff
where
d
you
think
you
be
if
it
was
for
our
capital
behind
you
and
our
lists
of
properties
and
all
the
prospects
we
find
for
you
all
you
got
to
do
is
follow
up
our
tips
and
close
the
deal
the
could
sell
listings
you
say
you
engaged
to
a
girl
but
have
to
put
in
your
evenings
chasing
after
buyers
well
why
the
devil
should
you
what
do
you
want
to
do
sit
around
holding
her
hand
let
me
tell
you
stan
if
your
girl
is
worth
her
salt
she
be
glad
to
know
you
out
hustling
making
some
money
to
furnish
the
instead
of
doing
the
the
kind
of
fellow
that
kicks
about
working
overtime
that
wants
to
spend
his
evenings
reading
trashy
novels
or
spooning
and
exchanging
a
lot
of
nonsense
and
foolishness
with
some
girl
he
ai
the
kind
of
upstanding
energetic
young
man
with
a
future
and
with
vision
that
we
want
here
how
about
it
what
your
ideal
anyway
do
you
want
to
make
money
and
be
a
responsible
member
of
the
community
or
do
you
want
to
be
a
loafer
with
no
inspiration
or
pep
graff
was
not
so
amenable
to
vision
and
ideals
as
usual
you
bet
i
want
to
make
money
that
why
i
want
that
bonus
honest
babbitt
i
do
want
to
get
fresh
but
this
heiler
house
is
a
terror
fall
for
it
the
flooring
is
rotten
and
the
walls
are
full
of
that
exactly
what
i
mean
to
a
salesman
with
a
love
for
his
profession
it
hard
problems
like
that
that
inspire
him
to
do
his
best
besides
stan
matter
o
fact
thompson
and
i
are
against
bonuses
as
a
matter
of
principle
we
like
you
and
we
want
to
help
you
so
you
can
get
married
but
we
ca
be
unfair
to
the
others
on
the
staff
if
we
start
giving
you
bonuses
do
you
see
we
going
to
hurt
the
feeling
and
be
unjust
to
penniman
and
laylock
right
right
and
discrimination
is
unfair
and
there
ai
going
to
be
any
of
it
in
this
office
do
get
the
idea
stan
that
because
during
the
war
salesmen
were
hard
to
hire
now
when
there
a
lot
of
men
out
of
work
there
are
a
slew
of
bright
young
fellows
that
would
be
glad
to
step
in
and
enjoy
your
opportunities
and
not
act
as
if
thompson
and
i
were
his
enemies
and
not
do
any
work
except
for
bonuses
how
about
it
heh
how
about
it
oh
well
gee
of
course
sighed
graff
as
he
went
out
crabwise
babbitt
did
not
often
squabble
with
his
employees
he
liked
to
like
the
people
about
him
he
was
dismayed
when
they
did
not
like
him
it
was
only
when
they
attacked
the
sacred
purse
that
he
was
frightened
into
fury
but
then
being
a
man
given
to
oratory
and
high
principles
he
enjoyed
the
sound
of
his
own
vocabulary
and
the
warmth
of
his
own
virtue
today
he
had
so
passionately
indulged
in
that
he
wondered
whether
he
had
been
entirely
just
after
all
stan
is
a
boy
any
more
ought
to
call
him
so
hard
but
rats
got
to
haul
folks
over
the
coals
now
and
then
for
their
own
good
unpleasant
duty
but
i
wonder
if
stan
is
sore
what
he
saying
to
mcgoun
out
there
so
chill
a
wind
of
hatred
blew
from
the
outer
office
that
the
normal
comfort
of
his
evening
was
ruined
he
was
distressed
by
losing
that
approval
of
his
employees
to
which
an
executive
is
always
slave
ordinarily
he
left
the
office
with
a
thousand
enjoyable
fussy
directions
to
the
effect
that
there
would
undoubtedly
be
important
tasks
and
miss
mcgoun
and
miss
bannigan
would
do
well
to
be
there
early
and
for
heaven
sake
remind
him
to
call
up
conrad
lyte
soon
he
came
in
he
departed
with
feigned
and
apologetic
liveliness
he
was
as
afraid
of
his
clerks
of
the
eyes
focused
on
him
miss
mcgoun
staring
with
head
lifted
from
her
typing
miss
bannigan
looking
over
her
ledger
mat
penniman
craning
around
at
his
desk
in
the
dark
alcove
stanley
graff
sullenly
expressionless
as
a
parvenu
before
the
bleak
propriety
of
his
butler
he
hated
to
expose
his
back
to
their
laughter
and
in
his
effort
to
be
casually
merry
he
stammered
and
was
raucously
friendly
and
oozed
wretchedly
out
of
the
door
but
he
forgot
his
misery
when
he
saw
from
smith
street
the
charms
of
floral
heights
the
roofs
of
red
tile
and
green
slate
the
shining
new
and
the
stainless
walls
iii
he
stopped
to
inform
howard
littlefield
his
scholarly
neighbor
that
though
the
day
had
been
springlike
the
evening
might
be
cold
he
went
in
to
shout
where
are
you
at
his
wife
with
no
very
definite
desire
to
know
where
she
was
he
examined
the
lawn
to
see
whether
the
had
raked
it
properly
with
some
satisfaction
and
a
good
deal
of
discussion
of
the
matter
with
babbitt
ted
and
howard
littlefield
he
concluded
that
the
had
not
raked
it
properly
he
cut
two
tufts
of
wild
grass
with
his
wife
largest
he
informed
ted
that
it
was
all
nonsense
having
a
big
husky
fellow
like
you
ought
to
do
all
the
work
around
the
house
and
privately
he
meditated
that
it
was
agreeable
to
have
it
known
throughout
the
neighborhood
that
he
was
so
prosperous
that
his
son
never
worked
around
the
house
he
stood
on
the
and
did
his
day
exercises
arms
out
sidewise
for
two
minutes
up
for
two
minutes
while
he
muttered
ought
take
more
exercise
keep
in
shape
then
went
in
to
see
whether
his
collar
needed
changing
before
dinner
as
usual
it
apparently
did
not
the
maid
a
powerful
woman
beat
the
the
roast
of
beef
roasted
potatoes
and
string
beans
were
excellent
this
evening
and
after
an
adequate
sketch
of
the
day
progressive
his
fee
his
lunch
with
paul
riesling
and
the
proven
merits
of
the
new
he
was
moved
to
a
benign
sort
o
thinking
about
buyin
a
new
car
believe
we
get
one
till
next
year
but
still
we
verona
the
older
daughter
cried
oh
dad
if
you
do
why
do
you
get
a
sedan
that
would
be
perfectly
slick
a
closed
car
is
so
much
more
comfy
than
an
open
well
now
i
do
know
about
that
i
kind
of
like
an
open
car
you
get
more
fresh
air
that
oh
shoot
that
just
because
you
never
tried
a
sedan
let
get
one
it
got
a
lot
more
class
said
ted
a
closed
car
does
keep
the
clothes
nicer
from
babbitt
you
do
get
your
hair
blown
all
to
pieces
from
verona
it
a
lot
sportier
from
ted
and
from
tinka
the
youngest
oh
let
have
a
sedan
mary
ellen
father
has
got
ted
wound
up
oh
got
a
closed
car
now
except
us
babbitt
faced
them
i
guess
you
got
nothing
very
terrible
to
complain
about
anyway
i
do
keep
a
car
just
to
enable
you
children
to
look
like
millionaires
and
i
like
an
open
car
so
you
can
put
the
top
down
on
summer
evenings
and
go
out
for
a
drive
and
get
some
good
fresh
air
besides
a
closed
car
costs
more
aw
gee
whiz
if
the
doppelbraus
can
afford
a
closed
car
i
guess
we
can
prodded
ted
humph
i
make
eight
thousand
a
year
to
his
seven
but
i
do
blow
it
all
in
and
waste
it
and
throw
it
around
the
way
he
does
do
believe
in
this
business
of
going
and
spending
a
whole
lot
of
money
to
show
off
and
they
went
with
ardor
and
some
thoroughness
into
the
matters
of
streamline
bodies
power
wire
wheels
chrome
steel
ignition
systems
and
body
colors
it
was
much
more
than
a
study
of
transportation
it
was
an
aspiration
for
knightly
rank
in
the
city
of
zenith
in
the
barbarous
twentieth
century
a
family
motor
indicated
its
social
rank
as
precisely
as
the
grades
of
the
peerage
determined
the
rank
of
an
english
family
indeed
more
precisely
considering
the
opinion
of
old
county
families
upon
newly
created
brewery
barons
and
viscounts
the
details
of
precedence
were
never
officially
determined
there
was
no
court
to
decide
whether
the
second
son
of
a
pierce
arrow
limousine
should
go
in
to
dinner
before
the
first
son
of
a
buick
roadster
but
of
their
respective
social
importance
there
was
no
doubt
and
where
babbitt
as
a
boy
had
aspired
to
the
presidency
his
son
ted
aspired
to
a
packard
and
an
established
position
in
the
motored
gentry
the
favor
which
babbitt
had
won
from
his
family
by
speaking
of
a
new
car
evaporated
as
they
realized
that
he
did
intend
to
buy
one
this
year
ted
lamented
oh
punk
the
old
boat
looks
as
if
it
had
fleas
and
been
scratching
its
varnish
babbitt
said
abstractedly
snoway
talkcher
babbitt
raged
if
you
too
much
of
a
gentleman
and
you
belong
to
the
bon
ton
and
so
on
why
you
need
take
the
car
out
this
ted
explained
i
did
mean
and
dinner
dragged
on
with
normal
domestic
delight
to
the
inevitable
point
at
which
babbitt
protested
come
come
now
we
ca
sit
here
all
evening
give
the
girl
a
chance
to
clear
away
the
he
was
fretting
what
a
family
i
do
know
how
we
all
get
to
scrapping
this
way
like
to
go
off
some
place
and
be
able
to
hear
myself
think
paul
maine
wear
old
pants
and
loaf
and
he
said
cautiously
to
his
wife
i
been
in
correspondence
with
a
man
in
new
york
wants
me
to
see
him
about
a
trade
may
not
come
off
till
summer
hope
it
does
break
just
when
we
and
the
rieslings
get
ready
to
go
to
maine
be
a
shame
if
we
could
make
the
trip
there
together
well
no
use
worrying
verona
escaped
immediately
after
dinner
with
no
discussion
save
an
automatic
why
do
you
ever
stay
home
from
babbitt
in
the
in
a
corner
of
the
davenport
ted
settled
down
to
his
home
study
plain
geometry
cicero
and
the
agonizing
metaphors
of
comus
i
do
see
why
they
give
us
this
junk
by
milton
and
shakespeare
and
wordsworth
and
all
these
he
protested
oh
i
guess
i
could
stand
it
to
see
a
show
by
shakespeare
if
they
had
swell
scenery
and
put
on
a
lot
of
dog
but
to
sit
down
in
cold
blood
and
read
these
teachers
how
do
they
get
that
way
babbitt
darning
socks
speculated
yes
i
wonder
why
of
course
i
do
want
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
professors
and
everybody
but
i
do
think
there
things
in
shakespeare
not
that
i
read
him
much
but
when
i
was
young
the
girls
used
to
show
me
passages
that
were
really
they
were
at
all
babbitt
looked
up
irritably
from
the
comic
strips
in
the
evening
advocate
they
composed
his
favorite
literature
and
art
these
illustrated
chronicles
in
which
mutt
hit
jeff
with
a
rotten
egg
and
mother
corrected
father
vulgarisms
by
means
of
a
with
the
solemn
face
of
a
devotee
breathing
heavily
through
his
open
mouth
he
plodded
nightly
through
every
picture
and
during
the
rite
he
detested
interruptions
furthermore
he
felt
that
on
the
subject
of
shakespeare
he
was
really
an
authority
neither
the
the
evening
advocate
nor
the
bulletin
of
the
zenith
chamber
of
commerce
had
ever
had
an
editorial
on
the
matter
and
until
one
of
them
had
spoken
he
found
it
hard
to
form
an
original
opinion
but
even
at
risk
of
floundering
in
strange
bogs
he
could
not
keep
out
of
an
open
controversy
i
tell
you
why
you
have
to
study
shakespeare
and
those
it
because
they
required
for
college
entrance
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
personally
i
do
see
myself
why
they
stuck
into
an
system
like
we
have
in
this
state
be
a
good
deal
better
if
you
took
business
english
and
learned
how
to
write
an
ad
or
letters
that
would
pull
but
there
it
is
and
there
no
talk
argument
or
discussion
about
it
trouble
with
you
ted
is
you
always
want
to
do
something
different
if
you
going
to
and
you
are
i
never
had
a
chance
to
but
i
see
that
you
do
why
you
want
to
lay
in
all
the
english
and
latin
you
can
oh
punk
i
do
see
what
the
use
of
or
even
finishing
high
school
i
do
want
to
go
to
college
honest
lot
of
fellows
that
have
graduated
from
colleges
that
do
begin
to
make
as
much
money
as
fellows
that
went
to
work
early
old
shimmy
peters
that
teaches
latin
in
the
high
he
a
from
columbia
and
he
sits
up
all
night
reading
a
lot
of
greasy
books
and
he
always
spieling
about
the
of
languages
and
the
poor
soak
does
make
but
eighteen
hundred
a
year
and
no
traveling
salesman
would
think
of
working
for
that
i
know
what
i
like
to
do
i
like
to
be
an
aviator
or
own
a
corking
big
garage
or
else
a
fellow
was
telling
me
about
it
yesterday
i
like
to
be
one
of
these
fellows
that
the
standard
oil
company
sends
out
to
china
and
you
live
in
a
compound
and
do
have
to
do
any
work
and
you
get
to
see
the
world
and
pagodas
and
the
ocean
and
everything
and
then
i
could
take
up
the
real
stuff
you
do
have
to
recite
to
some
old
dame
that
trying
to
show
off
to
the
principal
and
you
can
study
any
subject
you
want
to
just
listen
to
these
i
clipped
out
the
ads
of
some
swell
he
snatched
from
the
back
of
his
geometry
half
a
hundred
advertisements
of
those
courses
which
the
energy
and
foresight
of
american
commerce
have
contributed
to
the
science
of
education
the
first
displayed
the
portrait
of
a
young
man
with
a
pure
brow
an
iron
jaw
silk
socks
and
hair
like
patent
leather
standing
with
one
hand
in
his
and
the
other
extended
with
chiding
forefinger
he
was
bewitching
an
audience
of
men
with
gray
beards
paunches
bald
heads
and
every
other
sign
of
wisdom
and
prosperity
above
the
picture
was
an
inspiring
educational
symbol
no
antiquated
lamp
or
torch
or
owl
of
minerva
but
a
row
of
dollar
signs
the
text
ran
power
and
prosperity
in
public
speaking
a
yarn
told
at
the
club
who
do
you
think
i
ran
into
the
other
evening
at
the
de
luxe
restaurant
why
old
freddy
durkee
that
used
to
be
a
dead
shipping
clerk
in
my
old
place
we
used
to
laughingly
call
the
dear
fellow
one
time
he
was
so
timid
he
was
plumb
scared
of
the
super
and
never
got
credit
for
the
dandy
work
he
did
him
at
the
de
luxe
and
if
he
was
ordering
a
tony
feed
with
all
the
fixings
from
celery
to
nuts
and
instead
of
being
embarrassed
by
the
waiters
like
he
used
to
be
at
the
little
dump
where
we
lunched
in
old
lang
syne
he
was
bossing
them
around
like
he
was
a
millionaire
i
cautiously
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
freddy
laughed
and
said
say
old
chum

guess
you
wondering
what
come
over
me
you
be
glad
to
know

the
old
shop
and
right
on
the
high
road

prosperity
and
domination
and
i
look
forward
with
confidence
to
a
car
and
the
wife
is
making
things

in
the

there
were
eight
simple
lessons
in
plain
language
anybody
could
understand
and
i
studied
them
just
a
few
hours
a
night
then
started
practising
on
the
wife
soon
found
i
could
talk
right
up
to
the
super
and
get
due
credit
for
all
the
good
work
i
did
they
began
to
appreciate
me
and
advance
me
fast
and
say
old
doggo
what
do
you
think
they
paying
me
now
per
year
and
say
i
find
i
can
keep
a
big
audience
fascinated
speaking
on
any
topic
as
a
friend
old
boy
i
advise
you
to
send
for
circular
no
obligation
and
valuable
free

babbitt
was
again
without
a
canon
which
would
enable
him
to
speak
with
authority
nothing
in
motoring
or
real
estate
had
indicated
what
a
solid
citizen
and
regular
fellow
ought
to
think
about
culture
by
mail
he
began
with
hesitation
well
sounds
as
if
it
covered
the
ground
it
certainly
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
able
to
orate
i
sometimes
thought
i
had
a
little
talent
that
way
myself
and
i
know
darn
well
that
one
reason
why
a
fourflushing
old
like
chan
mott
can
get
away
with
it
in
real
estate
is
just
because
he
can
make
a
good
talk
even
when
he
has
got
a
doggone
thing
to
say
and
it
certainly
is
pretty
cute
the
way
they
get
out
all
these
courses
on
various
topics
and
subjects
nowadays
i
tell
you
though
no
need
to
blow
in
a
lot
of
good
money
on
this
stuff
when
you
can
get
a
course
in
eloquence
and
english
and
all
that
right
in
your
own
school
and
one
of
the
biggest
school
buildings
in
the
entire
country
that
so
said
babbitt
comfortably
while
ted
complained
yuh
but
dad
they
just
teach
a
lot
of
old
junk
that
is
any
practical
use
except
the
manual
training
and
typewriting
and
basketball
and
dancing
and
in
these
gee
you
can
get
all
kinds
of
stuff
that
would
come
in
handy
say
listen
to
this
one
you
play
a
man
part
you
are
walking
with
your
mother
sister
or
best
girl
and
some
one
passes
a
slighting
remark
or
uses
improper
language
wo
you
be
ashamed
if
you
ca
take
her
part
well
can
you
teach
boxing
and
by
mail
many
pupils
have
written
saying
that
after
a
few
lessons
they
outboxed
bigger
and
heavier
opponents
the
lessons
start
with
simple
movements
practised
before
your
mirror
holding
out
your
hand
for
a
coin
the
in
swimming
etc
before
you
realize
it
you
are
striking
scientifically
ducking
guarding
and
feinting
just
as
if
you
had
a
real
opponent
before
you
oh
baby
maybe
i
would
like
that
ted
chanted
i
tell
the
world
gosh
i
like
to
take
one
fellow
i
know
in
school
that
always
shooting
off
his
mouth
and
catch
him
alone
nonsense
the
idea
most
useless
thing
i
ever
heard
of
babbitt
fulminated
well
just
suppose
i
was
walking
with
mama
or
rone
and
somebody
passed
a
slighting
remark
or
used
improper
language
what
would
i
do
why
you
probably
bust
the
record
for
the
dash
i
would
not
i
stand
right
up
to
any
mucker
that
passed
a
slighting
remark
on
my
sister
and
i
show
him
look
here
young
dempsey
if
i
ever
catch
you
fighting
i
whale
the
everlasting
daylights
out
of
you
and
i
do
it
without
practising
holding
out
my
hand
for
a
coin
before
the
mirror
too
why
ted
dear
babbitt
said
placidly
it
not
at
all
nice
your
talking
of
fighting
this
way
well
gosh
almighty
that
a
fine
way
to
appreciate
and
then
suppose
i
was
walking
with
you
ma
and
somebody
passed
a
slighting
remark
nobody
going
to
pass
no
slighting
remarks
on
nobody
babbitt
observed
not
if
they
stay
home
and
study
their
geometry
and
mind
their
own
affairs
instead
of
hanging
around
a
lot
of
poolrooms
and
and
places
where
nobody
got
any
business
to
be
but
gooooooosh
dad
if
they
did
babbitt
chirped
well
if
they
did
i
would
do
them
the
honor
of
paying
any
attention
to
them
besides
they
never
do
you
always
hear
about
these
women
that
get
followed
and
insulted
and
all
but
i
believe
a
word
of
it
or
it
their
own
fault
the
way
some
women
look
at
a
person
i
certainly
never
been
insulted
by
aw
shoot
mother
just
suppose
you
were
sometime
just
suppose
you
suppose
something
ca
you
imagine
things
certainly
i
can
imagine
things
the
idea
certainly
your
mother
can
imagine
things
and
suppose
things
think
you
the
only
member
of
this
household
that
got
an
imagination
babbitt
demanded
but
what
the
use
of
a
lot
of
supposing
supposing
never
gets
you
anywhere
no
sense
supposing
when
there
a
lot
of
real
facts
to
take
into
considera
look
here
dad
suppose
i
mean
just
just
suppose
you
were
in
your
office
and
some
rival
man
realtor
some
realtor
that
you
hated
came
in
i
do
hate
any
but
suppose
you
did
i
do
intend
to
suppose
anything
of
the
kind
there
plenty
of
fellows
in
my
profession
that
stoop
and
hate
their
competitors
but
if
you
were
a
little
older
and
understood
business
instead
of
always
going
to
the
movies
and
running
around
with
a
lot
of
fool
girls
with
their
dresses
up
to
their
knees
and
powdered
and
painted
and
rouged
and
god
knows
what
all
as
if
they
were
then
you
know
and
you
suppose
that
if
there
any
one
thing
that
i
stand
for
in
the
circles
of
zenith
it
is
that
we
ought
to
always
speak
of
each
other
only
in
the
friendliest
terms
and
institute
a
spirit
of
brotherhood
and
cooperation
and
so
i
certainly
ca
suppose
and
i
ca
imagine
my
hating
any
realtor
not
even
that
dirty
fourflushing
society
sneak
cecil
rountree
but
and
there
no
if
and
or
but
about
it
but
if
i
were
going
to
lambaste
somebody
i
would
require
any
fancy
ducks
or
before
a
mirror
or
any
of
these
doodads
and
flipflops
suppose
you
were
out
some
place
and
a
fellow
called
you
vile
names
think
you
want
to
box
and
jump
around
like
a
you
just
lay
him
out
cold
at
least
i
certainly
hope
any
son
of
mine
would
and
then
you
dust
off
your
hands
and
go
on
about
your
business
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
and
you
are
going
to
have
any
by
mail
either
well
but
yes
i
just
wanted
to
show
how
many
different
kinds
of
there
are
instead
of
all
the
camembert
they
teach
us
in
the
but
i
thought
they
taught
boxing
in
the
school
that
different
they
stick
you
up
there
and
some
big
stiff
amuses
himself
pounding
the
stuffin
out
of
you
before
you
have
a
chance
to
learn
hunka
not
any
but
anyway
listen
to
some
of
these
the
advertisements

truly
philanthropic
one
of
them

the
rousing
headline

you

this
is
the
profession
you
have
been
looking
for
there
money
in
it
big
money
and
that
rapid
change
of
scene
that
entrancing
and
compelling
interest
and
fascination
which
your
active

and
adventurous
spirit
crave
think
of
being
the
chief
figure
and

factor
in
solving
strange
mysteries
and
baffling
crimes
this
wonderful
profession
brings
you
into
contact
with
influential
men
on
the
basis
of
equality
and
often
calls
upon
you
to
travel
everywhere
maybe
to
distant
lands
all
expenses
paid
no
special
education
oh
boy
i
guess
that
wins
the
necklace
would
it
be
swell
to
travel
everywhere
and
nab
some
famous
crook
whooped
ted
well
i
do
think
much
of
that
doggone
likely
to
get
hurt
still
that
stunt
might
be
pretty
fair
though
there
no
reason
why
if
put
their
minds
to
it
the
way
they
have
to
routing
products
in
a
factory
they
could
figure
out
some
scheme
so
a
person
would
have
to
monkey
with
all
this
practising
and
exercises
that
you
get
in
babbitt
was
impressed
and
he
had
a
delightful
parental
feeling
that
they
two
the
men
of
the
family
understood
each
other
he
listened
to
the
notices
of
universities
which
taught
writing
and
improving
the
memory
and
developing
the
banking
and
spanish
chiropody
and
photography
electrical
engineering
and
and
chemistry
well
well
babbitt
sought
for
adequate
expression
of
his
admiration
i
a
son
of
a
gun
i
knew
this
business
had
become
a
mighty
profitable
game
makes
suburban
look
like
two
cents
but
i
did
realize
it
got
to
be
such
a
must
rank
right
up
with
groceries
and
movies
always
figured
somebody
come
along
with
the
brains
to
not
leave
education
to
a
lot
of
bookworms
and
impractical
theorists
but
make
a
big
thing
out
of
it
yes
i
can
see
how
a
lot
of
these
courses
might
interest
you
i
must
ask
the
fellows
at
the
athletic
if
they
ever
realized
but
same
time
ted
you
know
how
advertisers
i
means
some
advertisers
exaggerate
i
do
know
as
they
be
able
to
jam
you
through
these
courses
as
fast
as
they
claim
they
oh
sure
dad
of
ted
had
the
immense
and
joyful
maturity
of
a
boy
who
is
respectfully
listened
to
by
his
elders
babbitt
concentrated
on
him
with
grateful
affection
i
can
see
what
an
influence
these
courses
might
have
on
the
whole
educational
works
course
i
never
admit
it
publicly
fellow
like
myself
a
state
graduate
it
only
decent
and
patriotic
for
him
to
blow
his
horn
and
boost
the
alma
mater
but
smatter
of
fact
a
whole
lot
of
valuable
time
lost
even
at
the
studying
poetry
and
french
and
subjects
that
never
brought
in
anybody
a
cent
i
do
know
but
what
maybe
these
might
prove
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
american
inventions
trouble
with
a
lot
of
folks
is
they
so
blame
material
they
see
the
spiritual
and
mental
side
of
american
supremacy
they
think
that
inventions
like
the
telephone
and
the
areoplane
and
wireless
no
that
was
a
wop
invention
but
anyway
they
think
these
mechanical
improvements
are
all
that
we
stand
for
whereas
to
a
real
thinker
he
sees
that
spiritual
and
uh
dominating
movements
like
efficiency
and
rotarianism
and
prohibition
and
democracy
are
what
compose
our
deepest
and
truest
wealth
and
maybe
this
new
principle
in
may
be
another
may
be
another
factor
i
tell
you
ted
we
got
to
have
vision
i
think
those
are
terrible
the
philosophers
gasped
it
was
babbitt
who
had
made
this
discord
in
their
spiritual
harmony
and
one
of
babbitt
virtues
was
that
except
during
when
she
was
transformed
into
a
raging
hostess
she
took
care
of
the
house
and
did
bother
the
males
by
thinking
she
went
on
firmly
it
sounds
awful
to
me
the
way
they
coax
those
poor
young
folks
to
think
they
learning
something
and
nobody
to
help
them
and
you
two
learn
so
quick
but
me
i
always
was
slow
but
just
the
same
babbitt
attended
to
her
nonsense
get
just
as
much
studying
at
home
you
do
think
a
fellow
learns
any
more
because
he
blows
in
his
father
money
and
sits
around
in
morris
chairs
in
a
swell
harvard
dormitory
with
pictures
and
shields
and
and
those
doodads
do
you
i
tell
you
i
a
college
man
i
know
there
is
one
objection
you
might
make
though
i
certainly
do
protest
against
any
effort
to
get
a
lot
of
fellows
out
of
barber
shops
and
factories
into
the
professions
they
too
crowded
already
and
what
we
do
for
workmen
if
all
those
fellows
go
and
get
educated
ted
was
leaning
back
smoking
a
cigarette
without
reproof
he
was
for
the
moment
sharing
the
high
thin
air
of
babbitt
speculation
as
though
he
were
paul
riesling
or
even
howard
littlefield
he
hinted
well
what
do
you
think
then
dad
would
it
be
a
good
idea
if
i
could
go
off
to
china
or
some
peppy
place
and
study
engineering
or
something
by
mail
no
and
i
tell
you
why
son
i
found
out
it
a
mighty
nice
thing
to
be
able
to
say
you
a
some
client
that
does
know
what
you
are
and
thinks
you
just
a
plug
business
man
he
gets
to
shooting
off
his
mouth
about
economics
or
literature
or
foreign
trade
conditions
and
you
just
ease
in
something
like
i
was
in
college
course
i
got
my
in
sociology
and
all
that
junk
oh
it
puts
an
awful
crimp
in
their
style
but
there
would
be
any
class
to
saying
got
the
degree
of
from
the
bezuzus
university
you
see
my
dad
was
a
pretty
good
old
coot
but
he
never
had
much
style
to
him
and
i
had
to
work
darn
hard
to
earn
my
way
through
college
well
it
been
worth
it
to
be
able
to
associate
with
the
finest
gentlemen
in
zenith
at
the
clubs
and
so
on
and
i
would
want
you
to
drop
out
of
the
gentlemen
class
the
class
that
are
just
as
as
the
common
people
but
still
have
power
and
personality
it
would
kind
of
hurt
me
if
you
did
that
old
man
i
know
dad
sure
all
right
i
stick
to
it
say
gosh
gee
whiz
i
forgot
all
about
those
kids
i
was
going
to
take
to
the
chorus
rehearsal
i
have
to
duck
but
you
have
done
all
your
do
it
first
thing
in
the
well
six
times
in
the
past
sixty
days
babbitt
had
stormed
you
will
not
it
first
thing
in
the
morning
you
do
it
right
now
but
he
said
well
better
hustle
and
his
smile
was
the
rare
shy
radiance
he
kept
for
paul
riesling
iv
ted
a
good
boy
he
said
to
babbitt
oh
he
is
who
these
girls
he
going
to
pick
up
are
they
nice
decent
girls
i
do
know
oh
dear
ted
never
tells
me
anything
any
more
i
understand
what
come
over
the
children
of
this
generation
i
used
to
have
to
tell
papa
and
mama
everything
but
seems
like
the
children
have
just
slipped
away
from
all
i
hope
they
decent
girls
course
ted
no
longer
a
kid
and
i
would
want
him
to
uh
get
mixed
up
and
george
i
wonder
if
you
ought
to
take
him
aside
and
tell
him
about
things
she
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
well
i
do
know
way
i
figure
it
myra
no
sense
suggesting
a
lot
of
things
to
a
boy
mind
think
up
enough
devilment
by
himself
but
i
wonder
it
kind
of
a
hard
question
wonder
what
littlefield
thinks
about
it
course
papa
agrees
with
you
he
says
all
this
instruction
is
he
says
oh
he
does
does
he
well
let
me
tell
you
that
whatever
henry
thompson
thinks
about
morals
i
mean
though
course
you
ca
beat
the
old
duffer
why
what
a
way
to
talk
of
papa
simply
ca
beat
him
at
getting
in
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
deal
but
let
me
tell
you
whenever
he
springs
any
ideas
about
higher
things
and
education
then
i
know
i
think
just
the
opposite
you
may
not
regard
me
as
any
great
but
believe
me
i
a
regular
college
president
compared
with
henry
yes
sir
by
golly
i
going
to
take
ted
aside
and
tell
him
why
i
lead
a
strictly
moral
oh
will
you
when
when
when
what
the
use
of
trying
to
pin
me
down
to
when
and
why
and
where
and
how
and
when
that
the
trouble
with
women
that
why
they
do
make
executives
they
have
any
sense
of
diplomacy
when
the
proper
opportunity
and
occasion
arises
so
it
just
comes
in
natural
why
then
i
have
a
friendly
little
talk
with
him
and
and
was
that
tinka
hollering
she
ought
to
been
asleep
long
he
prowled
through
the
and
stood
in
the
that
room
of
wicker
chairs
and
swinging
couch
in
which
they
loafed
on
sunday
afternoons
outside
only
the
lights
of
house
and
the
dim
presence
of
babbitt
favorite
elm
broke
the
softness
of
april
night
good
visit
with
the
boy
getting
over
feeling
cranky
way
i
did
this
morning
and
restless
though
by
golly
i
will
have
a
few
days
alone
with
paul
in
maine
that
devil
zilla
but
ted
all
right
whole
family
all
right
and
good
business
not
many
fellows
make
four
hundred
and
fifty
bucks
practically
half
of
a
thousand
dollars
easy
as
i
did
maybe
when
we
all
get
to
rowing
it
just
as
much
my
fault
as
it
is
theirs
ought
to
get
grouchy
like
i
do
but
wish
i
been
a
pioneer
same
as
my
but
then
would
have
a
house
like
this
i
oh
gosh
i
do
know
he
thought
moodily
of
paul
riesling
of
their
youth
together
of
the
girls
they
had
known
when
babbitt
had
graduated
from
the
state
university
years
ago
he
had
intended
to
be
a
lawyer
he
had
been
a
ponderous
debater
in
college
he
felt
that
he
was
an
orator
he
saw
himself
becoming
governor
of
the
state
while
he
read
law
he
worked
as
a
salesman
he
saved
money
lived
in
a
supped
on
poached
egg
on
hash
the
lively
paul
riesling
who
was
certainly
going
off
to
europe
to
study
violin
next
month
or
next
year
was
his
refuge
till
paul
was
bespelled
by
zilla
colbeck
who
laughed
and
danced
and
drew
men
after
her
plump
and
gaily
wagging
finger
babbitt
evenings
were
barren
then
and
he
found
comfort
only
in
second
cousin
myra
thompson
a
sleek
and
gentle
girl
who
showed
her
capacity
by
agreeing
with
the
ardent
young
babbitt
that
of
course
he
was
going
to
be
governor
some
day
where
zilla
mocked
him
as
a
country
boy
myra
said
indignantly
that
he
was
ever
so
much
solider
than
the
young
dandies
who
had
been
born
in
the
great
city
of
zenith
an
ancient
settlement
in
one
hundred
and
five
years
old
with
two
hundred
thousand
population
the
queen
and
wonder
of
all
the
state
and
to
the
catawba
boy
george
babbitt
so
vast
and
thunderous
and
luxurious
that
he
was
flattered
to
know
a
girl
ennobled
by
birth
in
zenith
of
love
there
was
no
talk
between
them
he
knew
that
if
he
was
to
study
law
he
could
not
marry
for
years
and
myra
was
distinctly
a
nice
girl
one
did
kiss
her
one
did
think
about
her
that
way
at
all
unless
one
was
going
to
marry
her
but
she
was
a
dependable
companion
she
was
always
ready
to
go
skating
walking
always
content
to
hear
his
discourses
on
the
great
things
he
was
going
to
do
the
distressed
poor
whom
he
would
defend
against
the
unjust
rich
the
speeches
he
would
make
at
banquets
the
inexactitudes
of
popular
thought
which
he
would
correct
one
evening
when
he
was
weary
and
he
saw
that
she
had
been
weeping
she
had
been
left
out
of
a
party
given
by
zilla
somehow
her
head
was
on
his
shoulder
and
he
was
kissing
away
the
tears
and
she
raised
her
head
to
say
trustingly
now
that
we
engaged
shall
we
be
married
soon
or
shall
we
wait
engaged
it
was
his
first
hint
of
it
his
affection
for
this
brown
tender
woman
thing
went
cold
and
fearful
but
he
could
not
hurt
her
could
not
abuse
her
trust
he
mumbled
something
about
waiting
and
escaped
he
walked
for
an
hour
trying
to
find
a
way
of
telling
her
that
it
was
a
mistake
often
in
the
month
after
he
got
near
to
telling
her
but
it
was
pleasant
to
have
a
girl
in
his
arms
and
less
and
less
could
he
insult
her
by
blurting
that
he
did
love
her
he
himself
had
no
doubt
the
evening
before
his
marriage
was
an
agony
and
the
morning
wild
with
the
desire
to
flee
she
made
him
what
is
known
as
a
good
wife
she
was
loyal
industrious
and
at
rare
times
merry
she
passed
from
a
feeble
disgust
at
their
closer
relations
into
what
promised
to
be
ardent
affection
but
it
drooped
into
bored
routine
yet
she
existed
only
for
him
and
for
the
children
and
she
was
as
sorry
as
worried
as
himself
when
he
gave
up
the
law
and
trudged
on
in
a
rut
of
listing
real
estate
poor
kid
she
has
had
much
better
time
than
i
have
babbitt
reflected
standing
in
the
dark
but
i
wish
i
could
had
a
whirl
at
law
and
politics
seen
what
i
could
do
well
maybe
i
made
more
money
as
it
he
returned
to
the
but
before
he
settled
down
he
smoothed
his
wife
hair
and
she
glanced
up
happy
and
somewhat
surprised
chapter
vii
i
he
solemnly
finished
the
last
copy
of
the
american
magazine
while
his
wife
sighed
laid
away
her
darning
and
looked
enviously
at
the
lingerie
designs
in
a
women
magazine
the
room
was
very
still
it
was
a
room
which
observed
the
best
floral
heights
standards
the
gray
walls
were
divided
into
artificial
paneling
by
strips
of
pine
from
the
babbitts
former
house
had
come
two
but
the
other
chairs
were
new
very
deep
and
restful
upholstered
in
blue
and
velvet
a
blue
velvet
davenport
faced
the
fireplace
and
behind
it
was
a
cherrywood
table
and
a
tall
with
a
shade
of
golden
silk
two
out
of
every
three
houses
in

heights
had
before
the

a

a
mahogany
table
real
or
imitation
and
a

a

on
the
table
was
a
runner
of
chinese
fabric
four
magazines
a
silver
box
containing

three
large
expensive
editions
of

by
english
artists
and
as
yet
unread
by
any
babbitt
save
tinka
in
a
corner
by
the
front
windows
was
a
large
cabinet
victrola

out
of

had
a

among
the

hung
in
the

of
each

were
a
red

black
imitation

an
anemic
imitation
with
a
french
caption
of
whose
morality
babbitt
had
always
been
rather
suspicious
and
a
photograph
of
a
colonial
room
rag

maiden
spinning

demure
before
a
white

nineteen
out

a
colored
photograph
of
a
new
england
house
a
photograph
of
a
rocky
mountain
or
all
four
it
was
a
room
as
superior
in
comfort
to
the
parlor
of
boyhood
as
his
motor
was
superior
to
his
father
buggy
though
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
that
was
interesting
there
was
nothing
that
was
offensive
it
was
as
neat
and
as
negative
as
a
block
of
artificial
ice
the
fireplace
was
unsoftened
by
downy
ashes
or
by
sooty
brick
the
brass
were
of
immaculate
polish
and
the
grenadier
andirons
were
like
samples
in
a
shop
desolate
unwanted
lifeless
things
of
commerce
against
the
wall
was
a
piano
with
another
but
no
one
used
it
save
tinka
the
hard
briskness
of
the
phonograph
contented
them
their
store
of
jazz
records
made
them
feel
wealthy
and
cultured
and
all
they
knew
of
creating
music
was
the
nice
adjustment
of
a
bamboo
needle
the
books
on
the
table
were
unspotted
and
laid
in
rigid
parallels
not
one
corner
of
the
was
curled
and
nowhere
was
there
a
a
torn
an
old
cap
or
a
gregarious
and
disorganizing
dog
ii
at
home
babbitt
never
read
with
absorption
he
was
concentrated
enough
at
the
office
but
here
he
crossed
his
legs
and
fidgeted
when
his
story
was
interesting
he
read
the
best
that
is
the
funniest
paragraphs
to
his
wife
when
it
did
not
hold
him
he
coughed
scratched
his
ankles
and
his
right
ear
thrust
his
left
thumb
into
his
vest
pocket
jingled
his
silver
whirled
the
and
the
keys
on
one
end
of
his
watch
chain
yawned
rubbed
his
nose
and
found
errands
to
do
he
went
upstairs
to
put
on
his
slippers
his
elegant
slippers
of
shaped
like
medieval
shoes
he
brought
up
an
apple
from
the
barrel
which
stood
by
the
in
the
basement
an
apple
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
he
enlightened
babbitt
for
quite
the
first
time
in
fourteen
hours
that
an
apple
is
nature
best
yes
it
trouble
with
women
is
they
never
have
sense
enough
to
form
regular
well
i
always
nibbling
and
eating
between
george
she
looked
up
from
her
reading
did
you
have
a
light
lunch
like
you
were
going
to
i
did
this
malicious
and
unprovoked
attack
astounded
him
well
maybe
it
was
as
light
as
went
to
lunch
with
paul
and
did
have
much
chance
to
diet
oh
you
need
to
grin
like
a
chessy
cat
if
it
was
for
me
watching
out
and
keeping
an
eye
on
our
diet
i
the
only
member
of
this
family
that
appreciates
the
value
of
oatmeal
for
breakfast
i
she
stooped
over
her
story
while
he
piously
sliced
and
gulped
down
the
apple
discoursing
one
thing
i
done
cut
down
my
smoking
had
kind
of
a
with
graff
in
the
office
he
getting
too
darn
fresh
i
stand
for
a
good
deal
but
once
in
a
while
i
got
to
assert
my
authority
and
i
jumped
him
i
said
well
i
told
him
just
exactly
where
he
got
off
funny
kind
of
a
day
makes
you
feel
restless
wellllllllll
uh
that
sleepiest
sound
in
the
world
the
terminal
yawn
babbitt
yawned
with
it
and
looked
grateful
as
he
droned
how
about
going
to
bed
eh
do
suppose
rone
and
ted
will
be
in
till
all
hours
yep
funny
kind
of
a
day
not
terribly
warm
but
yet
gosh
i
like
some
day
i
going
to
take
a
long
motor
yes
we
enjoy
that
she
yawned
he
looked
away
from
her
as
he
realized
that
he
did
not
wish
to
have
her
go
with
him
as
he
locked
doors
and
tried
windows
and
set
the
heat
regulator
so
that
the
would
open
automatically
in
the
morning
he
sighed
a
little
heavy
with
a
lonely
feeling
which
perplexed
and
frightened
him
so
was
he
that
he
could
not
remember
which
he
had
inspected
and
through
the
darkness
fumbling
at
unseen
perilous
chairs
he
crept
back
to
try
them
all
over
again
his
feet
were
loud
on
the
steps
as
he
clumped
upstairs
at
the
end
of
this
great
and
treacherous
day
of
veiled
rebellions
iii
before
breakfast
he
always
reverted
to
village
boyhood
and
shrank
from
the
complex
urban
demands
of
shaving
bathing
deciding
whether
the
current
shirt
was
clean
enough
for
another
day
whenever
he
stayed
home
in
the
evening
he
went
to
bed
early
and
thriftily
got
ahead
in
those
dismal
duties
it
was
his
luxurious
custom
to
shave
while
sitting
snugly
in
a
tubful
of
hot
water
he
may
be
viewed
as
a
plump
smooth
pink
baldish
podgy
goodman
robbed
of
the
importance
of
spectacles
squatting
in
water
scraping
his
cheeks
with
a
like
a
tiny
and
with
melancholy
dignity
clawing
through
the
water
to
recover
a
slippery
and
active
piece
of
soap
he
was
lulled
to
dreaming
by
the
caressing
warmth
the
light
fell
on
the
inner
surface
of
the
tub
in
a
pattern
of
delicate
wrinkled
lines
which
slipped
with
a
green
sparkle
over
the
curving
porcelain
as
the
clear
water
trembled
babbitt
lazily
watched
it
noted
that
along
the
silhouette
of
his
legs
against
the
radiance
on
the
bottom
of
the
tub
the
shadows
of
the
clinging
to
the
hairs
were
reproduced
as
strange
jungle
mosses
he
patted
the
water
and
the
reflected
light
capsized
and
leaped
and
volleyed
he
was
content
and
childish
he
played
he
shaved
a
swath
down
the
calf
of
one
plump
leg
the
was
dripping
a
dulcet
and
lively
song
drippety
drip
drip
dribble
drippety
drip
drip
drip
he
was
enchanted
by
it
he
looked
at
the
solid
tub
the
beautiful
nickel
taps
the
tiled
walls
of
the
room
and
felt
virtuous
in
the
possession
of
this
splendor
he
roused
himself
and
spoke
gruffly
to
his
come
here
you
done
enough
fooling
he
reproved
the
treacherous
soap
and
defied
the
scratchy
with
oh
you
would
would
you
he
soaped
himself
and
rinsed
himself
and
austerely
rubbed
himself
he
noted
a
hole
in
the
turkish
towel
and
meditatively
thrust
a
finger
through
it
and
marched
back
to
the
bedroom
a
grave
and
unbending
citizen
there
was
a
moment
of
gorgeous
abandon
a
flash
of
melodrama
such
as
he
found
in
when
he
laid
out
a
clean
collar
discovered
that
it
was
frayed
in
front
and
tore
it
up
with
a
magnificent
yeeeeeing
sound
most
important
of
all
was
the
preparation
of
his
bed
and
the
it
is
not
known
whether
he
enjoyed
his
because
of
the
fresh
air
or
because
it
was
the
standard
thing
to
have
a
just
as
he
was
an
elk
a
booster
and
a
member
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
just
as
the
priests
of
the
presbyterian
church
determined
his
every
religious
belief
and
the
senators
who
controlled
the
republican
party
decided
in
little
smoky
rooms
in
washington
what
he
should
think
about
disarmament
tariff
and
germany
so
did
the
large
national
advertisers
fix
the
surface
of
his
life
fix
what
he
believed
to
be
his
individuality
these
standard
advertised
wares
toothpastes
socks
tires
cameras
instantaneous
heaters
were
his
symbols
and
proofs
of
excellence
at
first
the
signs
then
the
substitutes
for
joy
and
passion
and
wisdom
but
none
of
these
advertised
tokens
of
financial
and
social
success
was
more
significant
than
a
with
a
below
the
rites
of
preparing
for
bed
were
elaborate
and
unchanging
the
blankets
had
to
be
tucked
in
at
the
foot
of
his
cot
also
the
reason
why
the
maid
had
tucked
in
the
blankets
had
to
be
discussed
with
mrs
babbitt
the
rag
rug
was
adjusted
so
that
his
bare
feet
would
strike
it
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
the
alarm
clock
was
wound
the
bottle
was
filled
and
placed
precisely
two
feet
from
the
bottom
of
the
cot
these
tremendous
undertakings
yielded
to
his
determination
one
by
one
they
were
announced
to
babbitt
and
smashed
through
to
accomplishment
at
last
his
brow
cleared
and
in
his
gnight
rang
virile
power
but
there
was
yet
need
of
courage
as
he
sank
into
sleep
just
at
the
first
exquisite
relaxation
the
doppelbrau
car
came
home
he
bounced
into
wakefulness
lamenting
why
the
devil
ca
some
people
never
get
to
bed
at
a
reasonable
hour
so
familiar
was
he
with
the
process
of
putting
up
his
own
car
that
he
awaited
each
step
like
an
able
executioner
condemned
to
his
own
rack
the
car
insultingly
cheerful
on
the
driveway
the
car
door
opened
and
banged
shut
then
the
garage
door
slid
open
grating
on
the
sill
and
the
car
door
again
the
motor
raced
for
the
climb
up
into
the
garage
and
raced
once
more
explosively
before
it
was
shut
off
a
final
opening
and
slamming
of
the
car
door
silence
then
a
horrible
silence
filled
with
waiting
till
the
leisurely
doppelbrau
had
examined
the
state

for

blessed
state
of
oblivion
iv
at
that
moment
in
the
city
of
zenith
horace
updike
was
making
love
to
lucile
mckelvey
in
her
mauve
on
royal
ridge
after
their
return
from
a
lecture
by
an
eminent
english
novelist
updike
was
zenith
professional
bachelor
a
man
of
with
an
effeminate
voice
and
taste
in
flowers
cretonnes
and
flappers
mckelvey
was
creamy
discontented
exquisite
rude
and
honest
updike
tried
his
invariable
first
maneuver
touching
her
nervous
wrist
do
be
an
idiot
she
said
do
you
mind
awfully
no
that
what
i
mind
he
changed
to
conversation
he
was
famous
at
conversation
he
spoke
reasonably
of
psychoanalysis
long
island
polo
and
the
ming
platter
he
had
found
in
vancouver
she
promised
to
meet
him
in
deauville
the
coming
summer
though
she
sighed
it
becoming
too
dreadfully
banal
nothing
but
americans
and
frowsy
english
and
at
that
moment
in
zenith
a
and
a
prostitute
were
drinking
cocktails
in
healey
hanson
saloon
on
front
street
since
national
prohibition
was
now
in
force
and
since
zenith
was
notoriously
they
were
compelled
to
keep
the
cocktails
innocent
by
drinking
them
out
of
the
lady
threw
her
cup
at
the
head
he
worked
his
revolver
out
of
the
pocket
in
his
sleeve
and
casually
murdered
her
at
that
moment
in
zenith
two
men
sat
in
a
laboratory
for
hours
now
they
had
been
working
on
a
report
of
their
investigations
of
synthetic
rubber
at
that
moment
in
zenith
there
was
a
conference
of
four
union
officials
as
to
whether
the
twelve
thousand
within
a
hundred
miles
of
the
city
should
strike
of
these
men
one
resembled
a
testy
and
prosperous
grocer
one
a
yankee
carpenter
one
a
and
one
a
russian
jewish
actor
the
russian
jew
quoted
kautsky
gene
debs
and
abraham
lincoln
at
that
moment
a
veteran
was
dying
he
had
come
from
the
civil
war
straight
to
a
farm
which
though
it
was
officially
within
the
of
zenith
was
primitive
as
the
backwoods
he
had
never
ridden
in
a
motor
car
never
seen
a
never
read
any
book
save
the
bible
mcguffey
readers
and
religious
tracts
and
he
believed
that
the
earth
is
flat
that
the
english
are
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
and
that
the
united
states
is
a
democracy
at
that
moment
the
steel
and
cement
town
which
composed
the
factory
of
the
pullmore
tractor
company
of
zenith
was
running
on
night
shift
to
fill
an
order
of
tractors
for
the
polish
army
it
hummed
like
a
million
bees
glared
through
its
wide
windows
like
a
volcano
along
the
high
wire
fences
searchlights
played
on
yards
and
armed
guards
on
patrol
at
that
moment
mike
monday
was
finishing
a
meeting
monday
the
distinguished
evangelist
the
protestant
pontiff
in
america
had
once
been
a
satan
had
not
dealt
justly
with
him
as
a
he
gained
nothing
but
his
crooked
nose
his
celebrated
vocabulary
and
his
the
service
of
the
lord
had
been
more
profitable
he
was
about
to
retire
with
a
fortune
it
had
been
well
earned
for
to
quote
his
last
report
rev
monday
the
prophet
with
a
punch
has
shown
that
he
is
the
world
greatest
salesman
of
salvation
and
that
by
efficient
organization
the
overhead
of
spiritual
regeneration
may
be
kept
down
to
an
unprecedented
basis
he
has
converted
over
two
hundred
thousand
lost
and
priceless
souls
at
an
average
cost
of
less
than
ten
dollars
a
of
the
larger
cities
of
the
land
only
zenith
had
hesitated
to
submit
its
vices
to
mike
monday
and
his
expert
reclamation
corps
the
more
enterprising
organizations
of
the
city
had
voted
to
invite
him
george
babbitt
had
once
praised
him
in
a
speech
at
the
club
but
there
was
opposition
from
certain
episcopalian
and
congregationalist
ministers
those
renegades
whom
monday
so
finely
called
a
bunch
of
with
instead
of
blood
a
gang
of
squealers
that
need
more
dust
on
the
knees
of
their
pants
and
more
hair
on
their
skinny
old
this
opposition
had
been
crushed
when
the
secretary
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
had
reported
to
a
committee
of
manufacturers
that
in
every
city
where
he
had
appeared
monday
had
turned
the
minds
of
workmen
from
wages
and
hours
to
higher
things
and
thus
averted
strikes
he
was
immediately
invited
an
expense
fund
of
forty
thousand
dollars
had
been
underwritten
out
on
the
county
fair
grounds
a
mike
monday
tabernacle
had
been
erected
to
seat
fifteen
thousand
people
in
it
the
prophet
was
at
this
moment
concluding
his
message
there
a
lot
of
smart
college
professors
and
slobs
in
this
burg
that
say
i
a
roughneck
and
a
and
my
knowledge
of
history
is
oh
there
a
gang
of
that
think
they
know
more
than
almighty
god
and
prefer
a
lot
of
hun
science
and
smutty
german
criticism
to
the
straight
and
simple
word
of
god
oh
there
a
swell
bunch
of
lizzie
boys
and
and
and
infidels
and
scribblers
that
love
to
fire
off
their
filthy
mouths
and
yip
that
mike
monday
is
vulgar
and
full
of
mush
those
pups
are
saying
now
that
i
hog
the
that
i
in
it
for
the
coin
well
now
listen
folks
i
going
to
give
those
birds
a
chance
they
can
stand
right
up
here
and
tell
me
to
my
face
that
i
a
galoot
and
a
liar
and
a
hick
only
if
they
do
if
they
do
do
faint
with
surprise
if
some
of
those
liars
get
one
good
swift
poke
from
mike
with
all
the
kick
of
god
flaming
righteousness
behind
the
wallop
well
come
on
folks
who
says
it
who
says
mike
monday
is
a
fourflush
and
a
yahoo
huh
do
i
see
anybody
standing
up
well
there
you
are
now
i
guess
the
folks
in
this
man
town
will
quit
listening
to
all
this
kyoodling
from
behind
the
fence
i
guess
you
quit
listening
to
the
guys
that
pan
and
roast
and
kick
and
beef
and
vomit
out
filthy
atheism
and
all
of
you
come
in
with
every
grain
of
pep
and
reverence
you
got
and
boost
all
together
for
jesus
christ
and
his
everlasting
mercy
and
tenderness
at
that
moment
seneca
doane
the
radical
lawyer
and
kurt
yavitch
the
histologist
whose
report
on
the
destruction
of
epithelial
cells
under
radium
had
made
the
name
of
zenith
known
in
munich
prague
and
rome
were
talking
in
doane
library
zenith
a
city
with
gigantic
power
gigantic
buildings
gigantic
machines
gigantic
transportation
meditated
doane
i
hate
your
city
it
has
standardized
all
the
beauty
out
of
life
it
is
one
big
railroad
station
with
all
the
people
taking
tickets
for
the
best
cemeteries
yavitch
said
placidly
doane
roused
i
hanged
if
it
is
you
make
me
sick
kurt
with
your
perpetual
whine
about
do
you
suppose
any
other
nation
is
is
anything
more
standardized
than
england
with
every
house
that
can
afford
it
having
the
same
muffins
at
the
same
and
every
retired
general
going
to
exactly
the
same
evensong
at
the
same
gray
stone
church
with
a
square
tower
and
every
golfing
prig
in
harris
tweeds
saying
you
are
to
every
other
prosperous
ass
yet
i
love
england
and
for
standardization
just
look
at
the
sidewalk
cafes
in
france
and
the
in
italy
standardization
is
excellent
per
se
when
i
buy
an
ingersoll
watch
or
a
ford
i
get
a
better
tool
for
less
money
and
i
know
precisely
what
i
getting
and
that
leaves
me
more
time
and
energy
to
be
individual
in
and
i
remember
once
in
london
i
saw
a
picture
of
an
american
suburb
in
a
toothpaste
ad
on
the
back
of
the
saturday
evening
post
an
snowy
street
of
these
new
houses
georgian
some
of
or
with
low
raking
roofs
and
the
kind
of
street
you
find
here
in
zenith
say
in
floral
heights
open
trees
grass
and
i
was
homesick
no
other
country
in
the
world
that
has
such
pleasant
houses
and
i
care
if
they
are
standardized
it
a
corking
standard
no
what
i
fight
in
zenith
is
standardization
of
thought
and
of
course
the
traditions
of
competition
the
real
villains
of
the
piece
are
the
clean
kind
industrious
family
men
who
use
every
known
brand
of
trickery
and
cruelty
to
insure
the
prosperity
of
their
cubs
the
worst
thing
about
these
fellows
is
that
they
so
good
and
in
their
work
at
least
so
intelligent
you
ca
hate
them
properly
and
yet
their
standardized
minds
are
the
enemy
then
this
boosting
sneakingly
i
have
a
notion
that
zenith
is
a
better
place
to
live
in
than
manchester
or
glasgow
or
lyons
or
berlin
or
turin
it
is
not
and
i
have
lift
in
most
of
them
murmured
yavitch
well
matter
of
taste
personally
i
prefer
a
city
with
a
future
so
unknown
that
it
excites
my
imagination
but
what
i
particularly
want
you
said
yavitch
are
a
liberal
and
you
the
slightest
idea
what
you
want
i
being
a
revolutionist
know
exactly
what
i
want
and
what
i
want
now
is
a
vi
at
that
moment
in
zenith
jake
offutt
the
politician
and
henry
thompson
were
in
conference
offutt
suggested
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
your
fool
babbitt
to
put
it
over
he
one
of
these
patriotic
guys
when
he
grabs
a
piece
of
property
for
the
gang
he
makes
it
look
like
we
were
dyin
of
love
for
the
dear
peepul
and
i
do
love
to
buy
respectability
reasonable
wonder
how
long
we
can
keep
it
up
hank
we
safe
as
long
as
the
good
little
boys
like
george
babbitt
and
all
the
nice
respectable
think
you
and
me
are
rugged
patriots
there
swell
pickings
for
an
honest
politician
here
hank
a
whole
city
working
to
provide
cigars
and
fried
chicken
and
dry
martinis
for
us
and
rallying
to
our
banner
with
indignation
oh
fierce
indignation
whenever
some
squealer
like
this
fellow
seneca
doane
comes
along
honest
hank
a
smart
codger
like
me
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
if
he
did
milk
cattle
like
them
when
they
come
around
mooing
for
it
but
the
traction
gang
ca
get
away
with
grand
larceny
like
it
used
to
i
wonder
when
hank
i
wish
we
could
fix
some
way
to
run
this
fellow
seneca
doane
out
of
town
it
him
or
us
at
that
moment
in
zenith
three
hundred
and
forty
or
fifty
thousand
ordinary
people
were
asleep
a
vast
unpenetrated
shadow
in
the
slum
beyond
the
railroad
tracks
a
young
man
who
for
six
months
had
sought
work
turned
on
the
gas
and
killed
himself
and
his
wife
at
that
moment
lloyd
mallam
the
poet
owner
of
the
hafiz
book
shop
was
finishing
a
rondeau
to
show
how
diverting
was
life
amid
the
feuds
of
medieval
florence
but
how
dull
it
was
in
so
obvious
a
place
as
zenith
and
at
that
moment
george
babbitt
turned
ponderously
in
bed
the
last
turn
signifying
that
he
had
enough
of
this
worried
business
of
falling
asleep
and
was
about
it
in
earnest
instantly
he
was
in
the
magic
dream
he
was
somewhere
among
unknown
people
who
laughed
at
him
he
slipped
away
ran
down
the
paths
of
a
midnight
garden
and
at
the
gate
the
fairy
child
was
waiting
her
dear
and
tranquil
hand
caressed
his
cheek
he
was
gallant
and
wise
and
warm
ivory
were
her
arms
and
beyond
perilous
moors
the
brave
sea
glittered
chapter
viii
i
the
great
events
of
babbitt
spring
were
the
secret
buying
of
options
in
linton
for
certain
officials
before
the
public
announcement
that
the
linton
avenue
car
line
would
be
extended
and
a
dinner
which
was
as
he
rejoiced
to
his
wife
not
only
a
regular
society
spread
but
a
real
highbrow
affair
with
some
of
the
keenest
intellects
and
the
brightest
bunch
of
little
women
in
it
was
so
absorbing
an
occasion
that
he
almost
forgot
his
desire
to
run
off
to
maine
with
paul
riesling
though
he
had
been
born
in
the
village
of
catawba
babbitt
had
risen
to
that
metropolitan
social
plane
on
which
hosts
have
as
many
as
four
people
at
dinner
without
planning
it
for
more
than
an
evening
or
two
but
a
dinner
of
twelve
with
flowers
from
the
florist
and
all
the
out
staggered
even
the
babbitts
for
two
weeks
they
studied
debated
and
arbitrated
the
list
of
guests
babbitt
marveled
of
course
we
ourselves
but
still
think
of
us
entertaining
a
famous
poet
like
chum
frink
a
fellow
that
on
nothing
but
a
poem
or
so
every
day
and
just
writing
a
few
advertisements
pulls
down
fifteen
thousand
berries
a
year
yes
and
howard
littlefield
do
you
know
the
other
evening
eunice
told
me
her
papa
speaks
three
languages
said
babbitt
huh
that
nothing
so
do
i
american
baseball
and
poker
i
do
think
it
nice
to
be
funny
about
a
matter
like
that
think
how
wonderful
it
must
be
to
speak
three
languages
and
so
useful
and
and
with
people
like
that
i
do
see
why
we
invite
the
orville
well
now
orville
is
a
mighty
fellow
yes
i
know
but
a
laundry
i
admit
a
laundry
has
got
the
class
of
poetry
or
real
estate
but
just
the
same
orvy
is
mighty
deep
ever
start
him
spieling
about
gardening
say
that
fellow
can
tell
you
the
name
of
every
kind
of
tree
and
some
of
their
greek
and
latin
names
too
besides
we
owe
the
joneses
a
dinner
besides
gosh
we
got
to
have
some
boob
for
audience
when
a
bunch
of
artists
like
frink
and
littlefield
get
well
dear
i
meant
to
speak
of
this
i
do
think
that
as
host
you
ought
to
sit
back
and
listen
and
let
your
guests
have
a
chance
to
talk
once
in
a
while
oh
you
do
do
you
sure
i
talk
all
the
time
and
i
just
a
business
man
oh
sure
i
no
like
littlefield
and
no
poet
and
i
anything
to
spring
well
let
me
tell
you
just
the
other
day
your
darn
chum
frink
comes
up
to
me
at
the
club
begging
to
know
what
i
thought
about
the
springfield
issue
and
who
told
him
i
did
you
bet
your
life
i
told
him
little
me
i
certainly
did
he
came
up
and
asked
me
and
i
told
him
all
about
it
you
bet
and
he
was
darn
glad
to
listen
to
me
and
duty
as
a
host
i
guess
i
know
my
duty
as
a
host
and
let
me
tell
you
in
fact
the
orville
joneses
were
invited
ii
on
the
morning
of
the
dinner
babbitt
was
restive
now
george

want
you

be
sure

be
home
early
tonight

minutes
later

a
manner
which

table
and
order
the
salted
almonds
and
look
at
the
chickens
and
arrange
for
the
children
to
have
their
supper
upstairs
and
and
i
simply
must
depend
on
you
to
go
to
vecchia
for
the
ice
all
riiiiiight
gosh
i
going
to
get
it
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
in
and
say
you
want
the
ice
cream
that
babbitt
ordered
yesterday
by
and
it
will
be
all
ready
for
at
she
telephoned
to
him
not
to
forget
the
ice
cream
from
vecchia
he
was
surprised
and
blasted
then
by
a
thought
he
wondered
whether
floral
heights
dinners
were
worth
the
hideous
toil
involved
but
he
repented
the
sacrilege
in
the
excitement
of
buying
the
materials
for
cocktails
now
this
was
the
manner
of
obtaining
alcohol
under
the
reign
of
righteousness
and
prohibition
he
drove
from
the
severe
rectangular
streets
of
the
modern
business
center
into
the
tangled
byways
of
old
town
jagged
blocks
filled
with
sooty
warehouses
and
lofts
on
into
the
arbor
once
a
pleasant
orchard
but
now
a
morass
of
tenements
and
brothels
exquisite
shivers
chilled
his
spine
and
stomach
and
he
looked
at
every
policeman
with
intense
innocence
as
one
who
loved
the
law
and
admired
the
force
and
longed
to
stop
and
play
with
them
he
parked
his
car
a
block
from
healey
hanson
saloon
worrying
well
rats
if
anybody
did
see
me
they
think
i
was
here
on
he
entered
a
place
curiously
like
the
saloons
of
days
with
a
long
greasy
bar
with
sawdust
in
front
and
streaky
mirror
behind
a
pine
table
at
which
a
dirty
old
man
dreamed
over
a
glass
of
something
which
resembled
whisky
and
with
two
men
at
the
bar
drinking
something
which
resembled
beer
and
giving
that
impression
of
forming
a
large
crowd
which
two
men
always
give
in
a
saloon
the
bartender
a
tall
pale
swede
with
a
diamond
in
his
lilac
scarf
stared
at
babbitt
as
he
stalked
plumply
up
to
the
bar
and
whispered
i
uh
friend
of
hanson
sent
me
here
like
to
get
some
the
bartender
gazed
down
on
him
in
the
manner
of
an
outraged
bishop
i
guess
you
got
the
wrong
place
my
friend
we
sell
nothing
but
soft
drinks
he
cleaned
the
bar
with
a
rag
which
would
itself
have
done
with
a
little
cleaning
and
glared
across
his
mechanically
moving
elbow
the
old
dreamer
at
the
table
petitioned
the
bartender
say
oscar
oscar
did
not
listen
aw
say
oscar
listen
will
yuh
say
the
decayed
and
drowsy
voice
of
the
loafer
the
agreeable
stink
of
threw
a
spell
of
inanition
over
babbitt
the
bartender
moved
grimly
toward
the
crowd
of
two
men
babbitt
followed
him
as
delicately
as
a
cat
and
wheedled
say
oscar
i
want
to
speak
to
whajuh
wanta
see
him
for
i
just
want
to
talk
to
him
here
my
it
was
a
beautiful
card
an
engraved
card
a
card
in
the
blackest
black
and
the
sharpest
red
announcing
that
george
babbitt
was
estates
insurance
rents
the
bartender
held
it
as
though
it
weighed
ten
pounds
and
read
it
as
though
it
were
a
hundred
words
long
he
did
not
bend
from
his
episcopal
dignity
but
he
growled
i
see
if
he
from
the
back
room
he
brought
an
immensely
old
young
man
a
quiet
man
in
tan
silk
shirt
checked
vest
hanging
open
and
burning
brown
trousers
healey
hanson
hanson
said
only
yuh
but
his
implacable
and
contemptuous
eyes
queried
babbitt
soul
and
he
seemed
not
at
all
impressed
by
the
new
suit
for
which
as
he
had
admitted
to
every
acquaintance
at
the
athletic
club
babbitt
had
paid
a
hundred
and
dollars
glad
meet
you
hanson
say
uh
i
george
babbitt
of
the
realty
company
i
a
great
friend
of
jake
well
what
of
it
say
uh
i
going
to
have
a
party
and
jake
told
me
you
be
able
to
fix
me
up
with
a
little
in
alarm
in
obsequiousness
as
eyes
grew
more
bored
you
telephone
to
jake
about
me
if
you
want
hanson
answered
by
jerking
his
head
to
indicate
the
entrance
to
the
back
room
and
strolled
away
babbitt
melodramatically
crept
into
an
apartment
containing
four
round
tables
eleven
chairs
a
brewery
calendar
and
a
smell
he
waited
thrice
he
saw
healey
hanson
saunter
through
humming
hands
in
pockets
ignoring
him
by
this
time
babbitt
had
modified
his
valiant
morning
vow
i
wo
pay
one
cent
over
seven
dollars
a
quart
to
i
might
pay
on
next
weary
entrance
he
besought
could
you
fix
that
up
hanson
scowled
and
grated
just
a
minute
pete
sake
just
a
in
growing
meekness
babbitt
went
on
waiting
till
hanson
casually
reappeared
with
a
quart
of
gin
what
is
euphemistically
known
as
a
quart
in
his
disdainful
long
white
hands
twelve
bucks
he
snapped
say
uh
but
say
jake
thought
you
be
able
to
fix
me
up
for
eight
or
nine
a
nup
twelve
this
is
the
real
stuff
smuggled
from
canada
this
is
none
o
your
neutral
spirits
with
a
drop
of
juniper
extract
the
honest
merchant
said
virtuously
twelve
bones
if
you
want
it
course
understand
i
just
doing
this
anyway
as
a
friend
of
sure
sure
i
understand
babbitt
gratefully
held
out
twelve
dollars
he
felt
honored
by
contact
with
greatness
as
hanson
yawned
stuffed
the
bills
uncounted
into
his
radiant
vest
and
swaggered
away
he
had
a
number
of
titillations
out
of
concealing
the
under
his
coat
and
out
of
hiding
it
in
his
desk
all
afternoon
he
snorted
and
chuckled
and
gurgled
over
his
ability
to
give
the
boys
a
real
shot
in
the
arm
he
was
in
fact
so
exhilarated
that
he
was
within
a
block
of
his
house
before
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
certain
matter
mentioned
by
his
wife
of
fetching
ice
cream
from
vecchia
he
explained
well
darn
it
and
drove
back
vecchia
was
not
a
caterer
he
was
the
caterer
of
zenith
most
parties
were
held
in
the
white
and
gold
ballroom
of
the
maison
vecchia
at
all
nice
teas
the
guests
recognized
the
five
kinds
of
vecchia
sandwiches
and
the
seven
kinds
of
vecchia
cakes
and
all
really
smart
dinners
ended
as
on
a
resolving
chord
in
vecchia
neapolitan
ice
cream
in
one
of
the
three
reliable
molds
the
melon
mold
the
round
mold
like
a
layer
cake
and
the
long
brick
vecchia
shop
had
pale
blue
woodwork
tracery
of
plaster
roses
attendants
in
frilled
aprons
and
glass
shelves
of
kisses
with
all
the
refinement
that
inheres
in
whites
of
eggs
babbitt
felt
heavy
and
thick
amid
this
professional
daintiness
and
as
he
waited
for
the
ice
cream
he
decided
with
hot
prickles
at
the
back
of
his
neck
that
a
girl
customer
was
giggling
at
him
he
went
home
in
a
touchy
temper
the
first
thing
he
heard
was
his
wife
agitated
george
did
you
remember
to
go
to
vecchia
and
get
the
ice
cream
say
look
here
do
i
ever
forget
to
do
things
yes
often
well
now
it
darn
seldom
i
do
and
it
certainly
makes
me
tired
after
going
into
a
joint
like
vecchia
and
having
to
stand
around
looking
at
a
lot
of
young
girls
all
rouged
up
like
they
were
sixty
and
eating
a
lot
of
stuff
that
simply
ruins
their
stomachs
oh
it
too
bad
about
you
i
noticed
how
you
hate
to
look
at
pretty
girls
with
a
jar
babbitt
realized
that
his
wife
was
too
busy
to
be
impressed
by
that
moral
indignation
with
which
males
rule
the
world
and
he
went
humbly
to
dress
he
had
an
impression
of
a
glorified
of
candles
polished
wood
lace
silver
roses
with
the
awed
swelling
of
the
heart
suitable
to
so
grave
a
business
as
giving
a
dinner
he
slew
the
temptation
to
wear
his
plaited
for
a
fourth
time
took
out
an
entirely
fresh
one
tightened
his
black
bow
and
rubbed
his
pumps
with
a
handkerchief
he
glanced
with
pleasure
at
his
garnet
and
silver
studs
he
smoothed
and
patted
his
ankles
transformed
by
silk
socks
from
the
sturdy
shanks
of
george
babbitt
to
the
elegant
limbs
of
what
is
called
a
clubman
he
stood
before
the
viewing
his
trim
his
beautiful
trousers
and
murmured
in
lyric
beatitude
by
golly
i
do
look
so
bad
i
certainly
do
look
like
catawba
if
the
hicks
back
home
could
see
me
in
this
rig
they
have
a
fit
he
moved
majestically
down
to
mix
the
cocktails
as
he
chipped
ice
as
he
squeezed
oranges
as
he
collected
vast
stores
of
bottles
glasses
and
spoons
at
the
sink
in
the
pantry
he
felt
as
authoritative
as
the
bartender
at
healey
hanson
saloon
true
babbitt
said
he
was
under
foot
and
matilda
and
the
maid
hired
for
the
evening
brushed
by
him
elbowed
him
shrieked
pleasopn
door
as
they
tottered
through
with
trays
but
in
this
high
moment
he
ignored
them
besides
the
new
bottle
of
gin
his
cellar
consisted
of
one
of
bourbon
whisky
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
of
italian
vermouth
and
approximately
one
hundred
drops
of
orange
bitters
he
did
not
possess
a
a
shaker
was
proof
of
dissipation
the
symbol
of
a
drinker
and
babbitt
disliked
being
known
as
a
drinker
even
more
than
he
liked
a
drink
he
mixed
by
pouring
from
an
ancient
into
a
handleless
pitcher
he
poured
with
a
noble
dignity
holding
his
alembics
high
beneath
the
powerful
mazda
globe
his
face
hot
his
a
glaring
white
the
copper
sink
a
scoured
he
tasted
the
sacred
essence
now
by
golly
if
that
is
pretty
near
one
fine
old
cocktail
kind
of
a
bronx
and
yet
like
a
manhattan
ummmmmm
hey
myra
want
a
little
nip
before
the
folks
come
bustling
into
the
moving
each
glass
a
quarter
of
an
inch
rushing
back
with
resolution
implacable
on
her
face
her
gray
and
party
frock
protected
by
a
denim
towel
babbitt
glared
at
him
and
rebuked
him
certainly
not
well
in
a
loose
jocose
manner
i
think
the
old
man
will
the
cocktail
filled
him
with
a
whirling
exhilaration
behind
which
he
was
aware
of
devastating
desires
to
rush
places
in
fast
motors
to
kiss
girls
to
sing
to
be
witty
he
sought
to
regain
his
lost
dignity
by
announcing
to
matilda
i
going
to
stick
this
pitcher
of
cocktails
in
the
refrigerator
be
sure
you
do
upset
any
of
well
be
sure
now
do
go
putting
anything
on
this
top
well
be
he
was
dizzy
his
voice
was
thin
and
distant
whee
with
enormous
impressiveness
he
commanded
well
be
sure
now
and
minced
into
the
safety
of
the
he
wondered
whether
he
could
persuade
as
slow
a
bunch
as
myra
and
the
littlefields
to
go
some
place
aft
dinner
and
raise
cain
and
maybe
dig
up
smore
he
perceived
that
he
had
gifts
of
profligacy
which
had
been
neglected
by
the
time
the
guests
had
come
including
the
inevitable
late
couple
for
whom
the
others
waited
with
painful
amiability
a
great
gray
emptiness
had
replaced
the
purple
swirling
in
babbitt
head
and
he
had
to
force
the
tumultuous
greetings
suitable
to
a
host
on
floral
heights
the
guests
were
howard
littlefield
the
doctor
of
philosophy
who
furnished
publicity
and
comforting
economics
to
the
street
traction
company
vergil
gunch
the
equally
powerful
in
the
elks
and
in
the
boosters
club
eddie
swanson
the
agent
for
the
javelin
motor
car
who
lived
across
the
street
and
orville
jones
owner
of
the
lily
white
laundry
which
justly
announced
itself
the
biggest
busiest
bulliest
cleanerie
shoppe
in
but
naturally
the
most
distinguished
of
all
was
cholmondeley
frink
who
was
not
only
the
author
of
poemulations
which
syndicated
daily
in
leading
newspapers
gave
him
one
of
the
largest
audiences
of
any
poet
in
the
world
but
also
an
optimistic
lecturer
and
the
creator
of
ads
that
despite
the
searching
philosophy
and
high
morality
of
his
verses
they
were
humorous
and
easily
understood
by
any
child
of
twelve
and
it
added
a
neat
air
of
pleasantry
to
them
that
they
were
set
not
as
verse
but
as
prose
frink
was
known
from
coast
to
coast
as
with
them
were
six
wives
more
or
less
it
was
hard
to
tell
so
early
in
the
evening
as
at
first
glance
they
all
looked
alike
and
as
they
all
said
oh
is
this
nice
in
the
same
tone
of
determined
liveliness
to
the
eye
the
men
were
less
similar
littlefield
a
tall
and
chum
frink
a
trifle
of
a
man
with
soft
and
hair
advertising
his
profession
as
poet
by
a
silk
cord
on
his
vergil
gunch
broad
with
coarse
black
hair
en
brosse
eddie
swanson
a
bald
and
bouncing
young
man
who
showed
his
taste
for
elegance
by
an
evening
waistcoat
of
figured
black
silk
with
glass
buttons
orville
jones
a
stubby
not
very
memorable
person
with
a
toothbrush
mustache
yet
they
were
all
so
well
fed
and
clean
they
all
shouted
georgie
with
such
robustness
that
they
seemed
to
be
cousins
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
the
longer
one
knew
the
women
the
less
alike
they
seemed
while
the
longer
one
knew
the
men
the
more
alike
their
bold
patterns
appeared
the
drinking
of
the
cocktails
was
as
canonical
a
rite
as
the
mixing
the
company
waited
uneasily
hopefully
agreeing
in
a
strained
manner
that
the
weather
had
been
rather
warm
and
slightly
cold
but
still
babbitt
said
nothing
about
drinks
they
became
despondent
but
when
the
late
couple
the
swansons
had
arrived
babbitt
hinted
well
folks
do
you
think
you
could
stand
breaking
the
law
a
little
they
looked
at
chum
frink
the
recognized
lord
of
language
frink
pulled
at
his
cord
as
at
a
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
that
which
was
the
custom
i
tell
you
george
i
a
man
but
they
do
say
verg
gunch
is
a
regular
yegg
and
of
course
he
bigger
i
am
and
i
just
ca
figure
out
what
i
do
if
he
tried
to
force
me
into
anything
criminal
gunch
was
roaring
well
i
take
a
chance
when
frink
held
up
his
hand
and
went
on
so
if
verg
and
you
insist
georgie
i
park
my
car
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
because
i
take
it
for
granted
the
crime
you
hinting
at
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
jones
asserted
mr
frink
is
simply
too
killing
you
think
he
was
so
innocent
babbitt
clamored
how
did
you
guess
it
chum
well
just
wait
a
moment
while
i
go
out
and
get
the
keys
to
your
cars
through
a
froth
of
merriment
he
brought
the
shining
promise
the
mighty
tray
of
glasses
with
the
cloudy
yellow
cocktails
in
the
glass
pitcher
in
the
center
the
men
babbled
oh
gosh
have
a
look
and
this
gets
me
right
where
i
live
and
let
me
at
it
but
chum
frink
a
traveled
man
and
not
unused
to
woes
was
stricken
by
the
thought
that
the
potion
might
be
merely
with
a
little
neutral
spirits
he
looked
timorous
as
babbitt
a
moist
and
ecstatic
almoner
held
out
a
glass
but
as
he
tasted
it
he
piped
oh
man
let
me
dream
on
it
ai
true
but
waken
me
jus
lem
me
slumber
two
hours
before
frink
had
completed
a
newspaper
lyric
beginning
i
sat
alone
and
groused
and
thunk
and
scratched
my
head
and
sighed
and
wunk
and
groaned
there
still
are
boobs
alack
who
like
the
back
that
den
that
makes
a
sage
a
loon
the
vile
and
smelly
old
saloon
i
never
miss
their
poison
booze
whilst
i
the
bubbling
spring
can
use
that
leaves
my
head
at
merry
morn
as
clear
as
any
babe
babbitt
drank
with
the
others
his
moment
depression
was
gone
he
perceived
that
these
were
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
he
wanted
to
give
them
a
thousand
cocktails
think
you
could
stand
another
he
cried
the
wives
refused
with
giggles
but
the
men
speaking
in
a
wide
elaborate
enjoyable
manner
gloated
well
sooner
than
have
you
get
sore
at
me
georgie
you
got
a
little
dividend
coming
said
babbitt
to
each
of
them
and
each
intoned
squeeze
it
georgie
squeeze
it
when
beyond
hope
the
pitcher
was
empty
they
stood
and
talked
about
prohibition
the
men
leaned
back
on
their
heels
put
their
hands
in
their
and
proclaimed
their
views
with
the
booming
profundity
of
a
prosperous
male
repeating
a
thoroughly
hackneyed
statement
about
a
matter
of
which
he
knows
nothing
whatever
now
i
tell
you
said
vergil
gunch
way
i
figure
it
is
this
and
i
can
speak
by
the
book
because
i
talked
to
a
lot
of
doctors
and
fellows
that
ought
to
know
and
the
way
i
see
it
is
that
it
a
good
thing
to
get
rid
of
the
saloon
but
they
ought
to
let
a
fellow
have
beer
and
light
howard
littlefield
observed
what
is
generally
realized
is
that
a
dangerous
to
invade
the
rights
of
personal
liberty
now
take
this
for
instance
the
king
of
bavaria
i
think
it
was
bavaria
yes
bavaria
it
was
in
march
he
issued
a
proclamation
against
public
grazing
of
the
peasantry
had
stood
for
overtaxation
without
the
slightest
complaint
but
when
this
proclamation
came
out
they
rebelled
or
it
may
have
been
saxony
but
it
just
goes
to
show
the
dangers
of
invading
the
rights
of
personal
that
it
no
one
got
a
right
to
invade
personal
liberty
said
orville
jones
just
the
same
you
do
want
to
forget
prohibition
is
a
mighty
good
thing
for
the
keeps
from
wasting
their
money
and
lowering
their
productiveness
said
vergil
gunch
yes
that
so
but
the
trouble
is
the
manner
of
enforcement
insisted
howard
littlefield
congress
did
understand
the
right
system
now
if
i
been
running
the
thing
i
have
arranged
it
so
that
the
drinker
himself
was
licensed
and
then
we
could
have
taken
care
of
the
shiftless
workman
kept
him
from
drinking
and
yet
not
interfered
with
the
rights
with
the
personal
liberty
of
fellows
like
they
bobbed
their
heads
looked
admiringly
at
one
another
and
stated
that
so
that
would
be
the
the
thing
that
worries
me
is
that
a
lot
of
these
guys
will
take
to
cocaine
sighed
eddie
swanson
they
bobbed
more
violently
and
groaned
that
so
there
is
a
danger
of
chum
frink
chanted
oh
say
i
got
hold
of
a
swell
new
receipt
for
beer
the
other
day
you
take
gunch
interrupted
wait
let
me
tell
you
mine
littlefield
snorted
beer
rats
thing
to
do
is
to
ferment
cider
jones
insisted
got
the
receipt
that
does
the
business
swanson
begged
oh
say
lem
me
tell
you
the
story
but
frink
went
on
resolutely
you
take
and
save
the
shells
from
peas
and
pour
six
gallons
of
water
on
a
bushel
of
shells
and
boil
the
mixture
till
babbitt
turned
toward
them
with
yearning
sweetness
frink
hastened
to
finish
even
his
best
and
she
said
gaily
dinner
is
there
was
a
good
deal
of
friendly
argument
among
the
men
as
to
which
should
go
in
last
and
while
they
were
crossing
the
hall
from
the
to
the
vergil
gunch
made
them
laugh
by
thundering
if
i
ca
sit
next
to
myra
babbitt
and
hold
her
hand
under
the
table
i
wo
play
i
goin
in
the
they
stood
embarrassed
while
babbitt
fluttered
now
let
me
see
oh
i
was
going
to
have
some
nice
for
you
but
oh
let
me
see
frink
you
sit
the
dinner
was
in
the
best
style
of
art
whereby
the
salad
was
served
in
hollowed
apples
and
everything
but
the
invincible
fried
chicken
resembled
something
else
ordinarily
the
men
found
it
hard
to
talk
to
the
women
flirtation
was
an
art
unknown
on
floral
heights
and
the
realms
of
offices
and
of
kitchens
had
no
alliances
but
under
the
inspiration
of
the
cocktails
conversation
was
violent
each
of
the
men
still
had
a
number
of
important
things
to
say
about
prohibition
and
now
that
each
had
a
loyal
listener
in
his
he
burst
out
i
found
a
place
where
i
can
get
all
the
hootch
i
want
at
eight
a
quart
did
you
read
about
this
fellow
that
went
and
paid
a
thousand
dollars
for
ten
cases
of
that
proved
to
be
nothing
but
water
seems
this
fellow
was
standing
on
the
corner
and
fellow
comes
up
to
him
they
say
there
a
whole
raft
of
stuff
being
smuggled
across
at
detroit
what
i
always
say
is
what
a
lot
of
folks
do
realize
about
prohibition
and
then
you
get
all
this
awful
poison
stuff
wood
alcohol
and
everything
course
i
believe
in
it
on
principle
but
i
do
propose
to
have
anybody
telling
me
what
i
got
to
think
and
do
no
american
ever
stand
for
that
but
they
all
felt
that
it
was
rather
in
bad
taste
for
orville
jones
and
he
not
recognized
as
one
of
the
wits
of
the
occasion
anyway
to
say
in
fact
the
whole
thing
about
prohibition
is
this
it
is
the
initial
cost
it
the
not
till
the
one
required
topic
had
been
dealt
with
did
the
conversation
become
general
it
was
often
and
admiringly
said
of
vergil
gunch
gee
that
fellow
can
get
away
with
murder
why
he
can
pull
a
raw
one
in
mixed
company
and
all
the
ladies
laugh
their
heads
off
but
me
gosh
if
i
crack
anything
that
just
the
least
bit
off
color
i
get
the
razz
for
fair
now
gunch
delighted
them
by
crying
to
eddie
swanson
youngest
of
the
women
louetta
i
managed
to
pinch
eddie
doorkey
out
of
his
pocket
and
what
say
you
and
me
sneak
across
the
street
when
the
folks
are
looking
got
something
with
a
gorgeous
leer
awful
important
to
tell
you
the
women
wriggled
and
babbitt
was
stirred
to
like
naughtiness
say
folks
i
wished
i
dared
show
you
a
book
i
borrowed
from
doc
patten
now
george
the
idea
babbitt
warned
him
this
book
racy
is
the
word
it
some
kind
of
an
anthropological
report
about
about
customs
in
the
south
seas
and
what
it
does
say
it
a
book
you
ca
buy
verg
i
lend
it
to
me
first
insisted
eddie
swanson
sounds
spicy
orville
jones
announced
say
i
heard
a
good
one
the
other
day
about
a
coupla
swedes
and
their
wives
and
in
the
best
jewish
accent
he
resolutely
carried
the
good
one
to
a
slightly
disinfected
ending
gunch
capped
it
but
the
cocktails
waned
the
seekers
dropped
back
into
cautious
reality
chum
frink
had
recently
been
on
a
among
the
small
towns
and
he
chuckled
awful
good
to
get
back
to
civilization
i
certainly
been
seeing
some
hick
towns
i
mean
course
the
folks
there
are
the
best
on
earth
but
gee
whiz
those
main
street
burgs
are
slow
and
you
fellows
ca
hardly
appreciate
what
it
means
to
be
here
with
a
bunch
of
live
ones
you
bet
exulted
orville
jones
they
the
best
folks
on
earth
those
folks
but
oh
mama
what
conversation
why
say
they
ca
talk
about
anything
but
the
weather
and
the
ford
by
heckalorum
that
right
they
all
talk
about
just
the
same
things
said
eddie
swanson
do
they
though
they
just
say
the
same
things
over
and
over
said
vergil
gunch
yes
it
really
remarkable
they
seem
to
lack
all
power
of
looking
at
things
impersonally
they
simply
go
over
and
over
the
same
talk
about
fords
and
the
weather
and
so
said
howard
littlefield
still
at
that
you
ca
blame
they
have
got
any
intellectual
stimulus
such
as
you
get
up
here
in
the
city
said
chum
frink
gosh
that
right
said
babbitt
i
do
want
you
highbrows
to
get
stuck
on
yourselves
but
i
must
say
it
keeps
a
fellow
right
up
on
his
toes
to
sit
in
with
a
poet
and
with
howard
the
guy
that
put
the
con
in
economics
but
these
boobs
with
nobody
but
each
other
to
talk
to
no
wonder
they
get
so
sloppy
and
uncultured
in
their
speech
and
so
in
their
thinking
orville
jones
commented
and
then
take
our
other
advantages
the
movies
frinstance
these
yapville
sports
think
they
if
they
have
one
change
of
bill
a
week
where
here
in
the
city
you
got
your
choice
of
a
dozen
movies
any
evening
you
want
to
name
sure
and
the
inspiration
we
get
from
rubbing
up
against
hustlers
every
day
and
getting
jam
full
of
ginger
said
eddie
swanson
same
time
said
babbitt
no
sense
excusing
these
rube
burgs
too
easy
fellow
own
fault
if
he
does
show
the
initiative
to
up
and
beat
it
to
the
city
like
we
done
did
and
just
speaking
in
confidence
among
friends
they
jealous
as
the
devil
of
a
city
man
every
time
i
go
up
to
catawba
i
have
to
go
around
apologizing
to
the
fellows
i
was
brought
up
with
because
i
more
or
less
succeeded
and
they
have
and
if
you
talk
natural
to
way
we
do
here
and
show
finesse
and
what
you
might
call
a
broad
point
of
view
why
they
think
you
putting
on
side
there
my
own
martin
runs
the
little
ole
general
store
my
dad
used
to
keep
say
i
bet
he
do
know
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
tux
as
a
if
he
was
to
come
in
here
now
he
think
we
were
a
bunch
of
of
why
gosh
i
swear
he
would
know
what
to
think
yes
sir
they
jealous
chum
frink
agreed
that
so
but
what
i
mind
is
their
lack
of
culture
and
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
if
you
excuse
me
for
being
highbrow
now
i
like
to
give
a
lecture
and
read
some
of
my
best
poetry
not
the
newspaper
stuff
but
the
magazine
things
but
say
when
i
get
out
in
the
tall
grass
there
nothing
will
take
but
a
lot
of
cheesy
old
stories
and
slang
and
junk
that
if
any
of
us
were
to
indulge
in
it
here
he
get
the
gate
so
fast
it
would
make
his
head
vergil
gunch
summed
it
up
fact
is
we
mighty
lucky
to
be
living
among
a
bunch
of
that
recognize
artistic
things
and
equally
we
feel
pretty
glum
if
we
got
stuck
in
some
main
street
burg
and
tried
to
wise
up
the
old
codgers
to
the
kind
of
life
we
used
to
here
but
by
golly
there
this
you
got
to
say
for
every
small
american
town
is
trying
to
get
population
and
modern
ideals
and
darn
if
a
lot
of
do
put
it
across
somebody
starts
panning
a
rube
crossroads
telling
how
he
was
there
in
and
it
consisted
of
one
muddy
street
count
one
and
nine
hundred
human
clams
well
you
go
back
there
in
and
you
find
pavements
and
a
swell
little
hotel
and
a
ladies
shop
real
perfection
in
fact
you
do
want
to
just
look
at
what
these
small
towns
are
you
want
to
look
at
what
they
aiming
to
become
and
they
all
got
an
ambition
that
in
the
long
run
is
going
to
make
the
finest
spots
on
earth
they
all
want
to
be
just
like
zenith
iii
however
intimate
they
might
be
with
cholmondeley
frink
as
a
neighbor
as
a
borrower
of
and
they
knew
that
he
was
also
a
famous
poet
and
a
distinguished
that
behind
his
easiness
were
sultry
literary
mysteries
which
they
could
not
penetrate
but
in
the
confidence
he
admitted
them
to
the
arcanum
i
got
a
literary
problem
that
worrying
me
to
death
i
doing
a
series
of
ads
for
the
zeeco
car
and
i
want
to
make
each
of
a
real
little
gem
stylistic
stuff
i
all
for
this
theory
that
perfection
is
the
stunt
or
nothing
at
all
and
these
are
as
tough
things
as
i
ever
tackled
you
might
think
it
be
harder
to
do
my
poems
all
these
heart
topics
home
and
fireside
and
happiness
but
they
cinches
you
ca
go
wrong
on
you
know
what
sentiments
any
decent
fellow
must
have
if
he
plays
the
game
and
you
stick
right
to
but
the
poetry
of
industrialism
now
there
a
literary
line
where
you
got
to
open
up
new
territory
do
you
know
the
fellow
who
really
the
american
genius
the
fellow
who
you
do
know
his
name
and
i
do
either
but
his
work
ought
to
be
preserved
so
future
generations
can
judge
our
american
thought
and
originality
why
the
fellow
that
writes
the
prince
albert
tobacco
ads
just
listen
to
this
it
that
jams
such
joy
in
jimmy
pipes
say
bet
you
often
to
that
about
hopping
from
five
to
by
stepping
on
her
a
bit
guess
that
going
some
all
right
but
just
among
ourselves
you
better
start
a
rapidwhiz
system
to
keep
tabs
as
to
how
fast
you
buzz
from
low
smoke
spirits
to
once
you
line
up
behind
a
jimmy
pipe
that
all
aglow
with
that
prince
albert
prince
albert
is
always
in
flavor
always
delightfully
cool
and
fragrant
for
a
fact
you
never
hooked
such
smoke
enjoyment
go
to
a
pipe
like
you
light
on
a
good
thing
why
packed
with
prince
albert
you
can
play
a
jimmy
straight
across
the
boards
and
you
know
what
that
means
now
that
caroled
the
motor
agent
eddie
swanson
that
what
i
call
that
prince
albert
fellow
though
gosh
there
be
just
one
fellow
that
writes
must
be
a
big
board
of
classy
in
conference
but
anyway
now
him
he
does
write
for
pikers
he
writes
for
regular
guys
he
writes
for
me
and
i
tip
my
benny
to
him
the
only
thing
is
i
wonder
if
it
sells
the
goods
course
like
all
these
poets
this
prince
albert
fellow
lets
his
idea
run
away
with
him
it
makes
elegant
reading
but
it
do
say
nothing
i
never
go
out
and
buy
prince
albert
tobacco
after
reading
it
because
it
does
tell
me
anything
about
the
stuff
it
just
a
bunch
of
frink
faced
him
oh
you
crazy
have
i
got
to
sell
you
the
idea
of
style
anyway
that
the
kind
of
stuff
i
like
to
do
for
the
zeeco
but
i
simply
ca
so
i
decided
to
stick
to
the
straight
poetic
and
i
took
a
shot
at
a
highbrow
ad
for
the
zeeco
how
do
you
like
this
the
long
white
trail
is
calling
calling
and
it
over
the
hills
and
far
away
for
every
man
or
woman
that
has
red
blood
in
his
veins
and
on
his
lips
the
ancient
song
of
the
buccaneers
it
away
with
dull
drudging
and
a
fig
for
care
speed
glorious
speed
it
more
than
just
a
moment
exhilaration
it
life
for
you
and
me
this
great
new
truth
the
makers
of
the
zeeco
car
have
considered
as
much
as
price
and
style
it
fleet
as
the
antelope
smooth
as
the
glide
of
a
swallow
yet
powerful
as
the
charge
of
a
class
breathes
in
every
line
listen
brother
you
never
know
what
the
high
art
of
hiking
is
till
you
try
life
zippingest
zest
the
zeeco
yes
frink
mused
that
got
an
elegant
color
to
it
if
i
do
say
so
but
it
ai
got
the
originality
of
the
whole
company
sighed
with
sympathy
and
admiration
chapter
ix
i
babbitt
was
fond
of
his
friends
he
loved
the
importance
of
being
host
and
shouting
certainly
you
going
to
have
smore
chicken
the
idea
and
he
appreciated
the
genius
of
cholmondeley
frink
but
the
vigor
of
the
cocktails
was
gone
and
the
more
he
ate
the
less
joyful
he
felt
then
the
amity
of
the
dinner
was
destroyed
by
the
nagging
of
the
swansons
in
floral
heights
and
the
other
prosperous
sections
of
zenith
especially
in
the
young
married
set
there
were
many
women
who
had
nothing
to
do
though
they
had
few
servants
yet
with
gas
stoves
electric
ranges
and
and
vacuum
cleaners
and
tiled
kitchen
walls
their
houses
were
so
convenient
that
they
had
little
housework
and
much
of
their
food
came
from
bakeries
and
delicatessens
they
had
but
two
one
or
no
children
and
despite
the
myth
that
the
great
war
had
made
work
respectable
their
husbands
objected
to
their
wasting
time
and
getting
a
lot
of
crank
ideas
in
unpaid
social
work
and
still
more
to
their
causing
a
rumor
by
earning
money
that
they
were
not
adequately
supported
they
worked
perhaps
two
hours
a
day
and
the
rest
of
the
time
they
ate
chocolates
went
to
the
went
went
in
gossiping
twos
and
threes
to
read
magazines
thought
timorously
of
the
lovers
who
never
appeared
and
accumulated
a
splendid
restlessness
which
they
got
rid
of
by
nagging
their
husbands
the
husbands
nagged
back
of
these
naggers
the
swansons
were
perfect
specimens
throughout
the
dinner
eddie
swanson
had
been
complaining
publicly
about
his
wife
new
frock
it
was
he
submitted
too
short
too
low
too
immodestly
thin
and
much
too
expensive
he
appealed
to
babbitt
honest
george
what
do
you
think
of
that
rag
louetta
went
and
bought
do
you
think
it
the
limit
what
eating
you
eddie
i
call
it
a
swell
little
oh
it
is
swanson
it
a
sweet
frock
babbitt
protested
there
now
do
you
see
smarty
you
such
an
authority
on
clothes
louetta
raged
while
the
guests
ruminated
and
peeped
at
her
shoulders
that
all
right
now
said
swanson
i
authority
enough
so
i
know
it
was
a
waste
of
money
and
it
makes
me
tired
to
see
you
not
wearing
out
a
whole
closetful
of
clothes
you
got
already
i
expressed
my
idea
about
this
before
and
you
know
good
and
well
you
did
pay
the
least
bit
of
attention
i
have
to
camp
on
your
trail
to
get
you
to
do
anything
there
was
much
more
of
it
and
they
all
assisted
all
but
babbitt
everything
about
him
was
dim
except
his
stomach
and
that
was
a
bright
scarlet
disturbance
had
too
much
grub
ought
to
eat
this
stuff
he
groaned
while
he
went
on
eating
while
he
gulped
down
a
chill
and
glutinous
slice
of
the
brick
and
cocoanut
cake
as
oozy
as
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
stuffed
with
clay
his
body
was
bursting
his
throat
was
bursting
his
brain
was
hot
mud
and
only
with
agony
did
he
continue
to
smile
and
shout
as
became
a
host
on
floral
heights
he
would
except
for
his
guests
have
fled
outdoors
and
walked
off
the
intoxication
of
food
but
in
the
haze
which
filled
the
room
they
sat
forever
talking
talking
while
he
agonized
darn
fool
to
be
eating
all
this
not
mouthful
and
discovered
that
he
was
again
tasting
the
sickly
welter
of
melted
ice
cream
on
his
plate
there
was
no
magic
in
his
friends
he
was
not
uplifted
when
howard
littlefield
produced
from
his
of
scholarship
the
information
that
the
chemical
symbol
for
raw
rubber
is
which
turns
into
isoprene
or
suddenly
without
precedent
babbitt
was
not
merely
bored
but
admitting
that
he
was
bored
it
was
ecstasy
to
escape
from
the
table
from
the
torture
of
a
straight
chair
and
loll
on
the
davenport
in
the
the
others
from
their
fitful
unconvincing
talk
their
expressions
of
being
slowly
and
painfully
smothered
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
the
toil
of
social
life
and
the
horror
of
good
food
as
much
as
himself
all
of
them
accepted
with
relief
the
suggestion
of
bridge
babbitt
recovered
from
the
feeling
of
being
boiled
he
won
at
bridge
he
was
again
able
to
endure
vergil
gunch
inexorable
heartiness
but
he
pictured
loafing
with
paul
riesling
beside
a
lake
in
maine
it
was
as
overpowering
and
imaginative
as
homesickness
he
had
never
seen
maine
yet
he
beheld
the
shrouded
mountains
the
tranquil
lake
of
evening
that
boy
paul
worth
all
these
ballyhooing
highbrows
put
together
he
muttered
and
i
like
to
get
away
from
even
louetta
swanson
did
not
rouse
him
swanson
was
pretty
and
pliant
babbitt
was
not
an
analyst
of
women
except
as
to
their
tastes
in
furnished
houses
to
rent
he
divided
them
into
real
ladies
working
women
old
cranks
and
fly
chickens
he
mooned
over
their
charms
but
he
was
of
opinion
that
all
of
them
save
the
women
of
his
own
family
were
different
and
yet
he
had
known
by
instinct
that
louetta
swanson
could
be
approached
her
eyes
and
lips
were
moist
her
face
tapered
from
a
broad
forehead
to
a
pointed
chin
her
mouth
was
thin
but
strong
and
avid
and
between
her
brows
were
two
outcurving
and
passionate
wrinkles
she
was
thirty
perhaps
or
younger
gossip
had
never
touched
her
but
every
man
naturally
and
instantly
rose
to
flirtatiousness
when
he
spoke
to
her
and
every
woman
watched
her
with
stilled
blankness
between
games
sitting
on
the
davenport
babbitt
spoke
to
her
with
the
requisite
gallantry
that
sonorous
floral
heights
gallantry
which
is
not
flirtation
but
a
terrified
flight
from
it
you
looking
like
a
new
to
night
am
i
ole
eddie
kind
of
on
the
yes
i
get
so
sick
of
well
when
you
get
tired
of
hubby
you
can
run
off
with
uncle
if
i
ran
away
oh
well
anybody
ever
tell
you
your
hands
are
awful
pretty
she
looked
down
at
them
she
pulled
the
lace
of
her
sleeves
over
them
but
otherwise
she
did
not
heed
him
she
was
lost
in
unexpressed
imaginings
babbitt
was
too
languid
this
evening
to
pursue
his
duty
of
being
a
captivating
though
strictly
moral
male
he
ambled
back
to
the
he
was
not
much
thrilled
when
frink
a
small
twittering
woman
proposed
that
they
try
and
do
some
spiritualism
and
you
know
chum
can
make
the
spirits
come
honest
he
just
scares
me
the
ladies
of
the
party
had
not
emerged
all
evening
but
now
as
the
sex
given
to
things
of
the
spirit
while
the
men
warred
against
base
things
material
they
took
command
and
cried
oh
let
in
the
dimness
the
men
were
rather
solemn
and
foolish
but
the
goodwives
quivered
and
adored
as
they
sat
about
the
table
they
laughed
now
you
be
good
or
i
tell
when
the
men
took
their
hands
in
the
circle
babbitt
tingled
with
a
slight
return
of
interest
in
life
as
louetta
swanson
hand
closed
on
his
with
quiet
firmness
all
of
them
hunched
over
intent
they
startled
as
some
one
drew
a
strained
breath
in
the
dusty
light
from
the
hall
they
looked
unreal
they
felt
disembodied
gunch
squeaked
and
they
jumped
with
unnatural
jocularity
but
at
frink
hiss
they
sank
into
subdued
awe
suddenly
incredibly
they
heard
a
knocking
they
stared
at
hands
and
found
them
lying
still
they
wriggled
and
pretended
not
to
be
impressed
frink
spoke
with
gravity
is
some
one
there
a
thud
is
one
knock
to
be
the
sign
for
a
thud
and
two
for
a
thud
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
shall
we
ask
the
guide
to
put
us
into
communication
with
the
spirit
of
some
great
one
passed
over
frink
mumbled
mrs
orville
jones
begged
oh
let
talk
to
dante
we
studied
him
at
the
reading
circle
you
know
who
he
was
certainly
i
know
who
he
was
the
wop
poet
where
do
you
think
i
was
raised
from
her
insulted
husband
sure
the
fellow
that
took
the
cook
tour
to
hell
i
never
waded
through
his
but
we
learned
about
him
in
the
said
babbitt
page
dannnnnty
intoned
eddie
swanson
you
ought
to
get
him
easy
frink
you
and
he
being
said
louetta
swanson
rats
where
d
you
get
that
stuff
protested
vergil
gunch
i
suppose
dante
showed
a
lot
of
speed
for
an
not
that
i
actually
read
him
of
course
but
to
come
right
down
to
hard
facts
he
would
stand
if
he
had
to
buckle
down
to
practical
literature
and
turn
out
a
poem
for
the
every
day
like
chum
does
that
so
from
eddie
swanson
those
old
birds
could
take
their
time
judas
priest
i
could
write
poetry
myself
if
i
had
a
whole
year
for
it
and
just
wrote
about
that
junk
like
dante
wrote
frink
demanded
hush
now
i
call
him
o
laughing
eyes
emerge
forth
into
the
uh
the
ultimates
and
bring
hither
the
spirit
of
dante
that
we
mortals
may
list
to
his
words
of
you
forgot
to
give
um
the
address
brimstone
avenue
fiery
heights
hell
gunch
chuckled
but
the
others
felt
that
this
was
irreligious
and
besides
probably
it
was
just
chum
making
the
knocks
but
still
if
there
did
happen
to
be
something
to
all
this
be
exciting
to
talk
to
an
old
fellow
belonging
to
way
back
in
early
times
a
thud
the
spirit
of
dante
had
come
to
the
parlor
of
george
babbitt
he
was
it
seemed
quite
ready
to
answer
their
questions
he
was
glad
to
be
with
them
this
frink
spelled
out
the
messages
by
running
through
the
alphabet
till
the
spirit
interpreter
knocked
at
the
right
letter
littlefield
asked
in
a
learned
tone
do
you
like
it
in
the
paradiso
messire
we
are
very
happy
on
the
higher
plane
signor
we
are
glad
that
you
are
studying
this
great
truth
of
spiritualism
dante
replied
the
circle
moved
with
an
awed
creaking
of
stays
and
suppose
suppose
there
were
something
to
this
babbitt
had
a
different
worry
suppose
chum
frink
was
really
one
of
these
spiritualists
chum
had
for
a
literary
fellow
always
seemed
to
be
a
regular
guy
he
belonged
to
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
church
and
went
to
the
boosters
lunches
and
liked
cigars
and
motors
and
racy
stories
but
suppose
that
secretly
after
all
you
never
could
tell
about
these
darn
highbrows
and
to
be
an
spiritualist
would
be
almost
like
being
a
socialist
no
one
could
long
be
serious
in
the
presence
of
vergil
gunch
ask
how
jack
shakespeare
and
old
verg
the
guy
they
named
after
me
are
gettin
along
and
do
they
wish
they
could
get
into
the
movie
game
he
blared
and
instantly
all
was
mirth
jones
shrieked
and
eddie
swanson
desired
to
know
whether
dante
did
catch
cold
with
nothing
on
but
his
wreath
the
pleased
dante
made
humble
answer
but
babbitt
the
curst
discontent
was
torturing
him
again
and
heavily
in
the
impersonal
darkness
he
pondered
i
do
we
all
so
flip
and
think
we
so
smart
there
be
a
fellow
like
dante
i
wish
i
read
some
of
his
pieces
i
do
suppose
i
ever
will
he
had
without
explanation
the
impression
of
a
slaggy
cliff
and
on
it
in
silhouette
against
menacing
clouds
a
lone
and
austere
figure
he
was
dismayed
by
a
sudden
contempt
for
his
surest
friends
he
grasped
louetta
swanson
hand
and
found
the
comfort
of
human
warmth
habit
came
a
veteran
warrior
and
he
shook
himself
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
me
this
evening
he
patted
louetta
hand
to
indicate
that
he
had
meant
anything
improper
by
squeezing
it
and
demanded
of
frink
say
see
if
you
can
get
old
dant
to
spiel
us
some
of
his
poetry
talk
up
to
him
tell
him
giorna

com
sa
va

keskersaykersa
a
little
pome
senor
ii
the
lights
were
switched
on
the
women
sat
on
the
fronts
of
their
chairs
in
that
determined
suspense
whereby
a
wife
indicates
that
as
soon
as
the
present
speaker
has
finished
she
is
going
to
remark
brightly
to
her
husband
well
dear
i
think
it
about
time
for
us
to
be
saying
for
once
babbitt
did
not
break
out
in
blustering
efforts
to
keep
the
party
going
he
had
there
was
something
he
wished
to
think
out
but
the
psychical
research
had
started
them
off
again
why
did
they
go
home
why
did
they
go
home
though
he
was
impressed
by
the
profundity
of
the
statement
he
was
only
when
howard
littlefield
lectured
the
united
states
is
the
only
nation
in
which
the
government
is
a
moral
ideal
and
not
just
a
social
true
true
were
they
ever
going
home
he
was
usually
delighted
to
have
an
inside
view
of
the
momentous
world
of
motors
but
he
scarcely
listened
to
eddie
swanson
revelation
if
you
want
to
go
above
the
javelin
class
the
zeeco
is
a
mighty
good
buy
couple
weeks
ago
and
mind
you
this
was
a
fair
square
test
they
took
a
zeeco
stock
and
they
slid
up
the
tonawanda
hill
on
high
and
fellow
told
me
zeeco
good
boat
but
were
they
planning
to
stay
all
night
they
really
were
going
with
a
flutter
of
we
did
have
the
best
time
most
aggressively
friendly
of
all
was
babbitt
yet
as
he
burbled
he
was
reflecting
i
got
through
it
but
for
a
while
there
i
did
hardly
think
i
last
he
prepared
to
taste
that
most
delicate
pleasure
of
the
host
making
fun
of
his
guests
in
the
relaxation
of
midnight
as
the
door
closed
he
yawned
voluptuously
chest
out
shoulders
wriggling
and
turned
cynically
to
his
wife
she
was
beaming
oh
it
was
nice
was
it
i
know
they
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
do
you
think
so
he
could
do
it
he
could
mock
it
would
have
been
like
sneering
at
a
happy
child
he
lied
ponderously
you
bet
best
party
this
year
by
a
long
was
the
dinner
good
and
honestly
i
thought
the
fried
chicken
was
delicious
you
bet
fried
to
the
queen
taste
best
fried
chicken
i
tasted
for
a
coon
did
matilda
fry
it
beautifully
and
do
you
think
the
soup
was
simply
delicious
it
certainly
was
it
was
corking
best
soup
i
tasted
since
heck
was
a
pup
but
his
voice
was
seeping
away
they
stood
in
the
hall
under
the
electric
light
in
its
square
shade
of
red
glass
bound
with
nickel
she
stared
at
him
why
george
you
do
sound
you
sound
as
if
you
had
really
enjoyed
sure
i
did
course
i
did
george
what
is
it
oh
i
kind
of
tired
i
guess
been
pounding
pretty
hard
at
the
office
need
to
get
away
and
rest
up
a
well
we
going
to
maine
in
just
a
few
weeks
now
yuh
then
he
was
pouring
it
out
nakedly
robbed
of
reticence
myra
i
think
be
a
good
thing
for
me
to
get
up
there
but
you
have
this
man
you
have
to
meet
in
new
york
about
what
man
oh
sure
him
oh
that
all
off
but
i
want
to
hit
maine
early
get
in
a
little
fishing
catch
me
a
big
trout
by
golly
a
nervous
artificial
laugh
well
why
do
we
do
it
verona
and
matilda
can
run
the
house
between
them
and
you
and
i
can
go
any
time
if
you
think
we
can
afford
but
that
i
been
feeling
so
jumpy
lately
i
thought
maybe
it
might
be
a
good
thing
if
i
kind
of
got
off
by
myself
and
sweat
it
out
of
george
do
you
want
me
to
go
along
she
was
too
wretchedly
in
earnest
to
be
tragic
or
gloriously
insulted
or
anything
save
dumpy
and
defenseless
and
flushed
to
the
red
steaminess
of
a
boiled
beet
of
course
i
do
i
just
meant
remembering
that
paul
riesling
had
predicted
this
he
was
as
desperate
as
she
i
mean
sometimes
it
a
good
thing
for
an
old
grouch
like
me
to
go
off
and
get
it
out
of
his
he
tried
to
sound
paternal
then
when
you
and
the
kids
arrive
i
figured
maybe
i
might
skip
up
to
maine
just
a
few
days
ahead
of
you
i
be
ready
for
a
real
bat
see
how
i
mean
he
coaxed
her
with
large
booming
sounds
with
affable
smiles
like
a
popular
preacher
blessing
an
easter
congregation
like
a
humorous
lecturer
completing
his
stint
of
eloquence
like
all
perpetrators
of
masculine
wiles
she
stared
at
him
the
joy
of
festival
drained
from
her
face
do
i
bother
you
when
we
go
on
vacations
do
i
add
anything
to
your
fun
he
broke
suddenly
dreadfully
he
was
hysterical
he
was
a
yelping
baby
yes
yes
yes
hell
yes
but
ca
you
understand
i
shot
to
pieces
i
all
in
i
got
to
take
care
of
myself
i
tell
you
i
got
to
i
sick
of
everything
and
everybody
i
got
to
it
was
she
who
was
mature
and
protective
now
why
of
course
you
shall
run
off
by
yourself
why
do
you
get
paul
to
go
along
and
you
boys
just
fish
and
have
a
good
time
she
patted
his
shoulder
reaching
up
to
it
while
he
shook
with
palsied
helplessness
and
in
that
moment
was
not
merely
by
habit
fond
of
her
but
clung
to
her
strength
she
cried
cheerily
now
you
go
and
pop
into
bed
we
fix
it
all
up
i
see
to
the
doors
now
skip
for
many
minutes
for
many
hours
for
a
bleak
eternity
he
lay
awake
shivering
reduced
to
primitive
terror
comprehending
that
he
had
won
freedom
and
wondering
what
he
could
do
with
anything
so
unknown
and
so
embarrassing
as
freedom
chapter
x
no
in
zenith
had
more
resolutely
experimented
in
condensation
than
the
revelstoke
arms
in
which
paul
and
zilla
riesling
had
a
flat
by
sliding
the
beds
into
low
closets
the
bedrooms
were
converted
into
the
kitchens
were
cupboards
each
containing
an
electric
range
a
copper
sink
a
glass
refrigerator
and
very
intermittently
a
balkan
maid
everything
about
the
arms
was
excessively
modern
and
everything
was
compressed
except
the
garages
the
babbitts
were
calling
on
the
rieslings
at
the
arms
it
was
a
speculative
venture
to
call
on
the
rieslings
interesting
and
sometimes
disconcerting
zilla
was
an
active
strident
blonde
when
she
condescended
to
be
she
was
nervously
amusing
her
comments
on
people
were
saltily
satiric
and
penetrative
of
accepted
hypocrisies
that
so
you
said
and
looked
sheepish
she
danced
wildly
and
called
on
the
world
to
be
merry
but
in
the
midst
of
it
she
would
turn
indignant
she
was
always
becoming
indignant
life
was
a
plot
against
her
and
she
exposed
it
furiously
she
was
affable
she
merely
hinted
that
orville
jones
wore
a
toupe
that
cholmondeley
frink
singing
resembled
a
ford
going
into
high
and
that
the
hon
otis
deeble
mayor
of
zenith
and
candidate
for
congress
was
a
flatulent
fool
which
was
quite
true
the
babbitts
and
rieslings
sat
doubtfully
on
brocade
chairs
in
the
small
of
the
flat
with
its
mantel
unprovided
with
a
fireplace
and
its
strip
of
heavy
gilt
fabric
upon
a
glaring
new
till
riesling
shrieked
come
on
let
put
some
pep
in
it
get
out
your
fiddle
paul
and
i
try
to
make
georgie
dance
the
babbitts
were
in
earnest
they
were
plotting
for
the
escape
to
maine
but
when
babbitt
hinted
with
plump
smilingness
does
paul
get
as
tired
after
the
winter
work
as
georgie
does
then
zilla
remembered
an
injury
and
when
zilla
riesling
remembered
an
injury
the
world
stopped
till
something
had
been
done
about
it
does
he
get
tired
no
he
does
get
tired
he
just
goes
crazy
all
you
think
paul
is
so
reasonable
oh
yes
and
he
loves
to
make
out
he
a
little
lamb
but
he
stubborn
as
a
mule
oh
if
you
had
to
live
with
him
you
find
out
how
sweet
he
is
he
just
pretends
to
be
meek
so
he
can
have
his
own
way
and
me
i
get
the
credit
for
being
a
terrible
old
crank
but
if
i
did
blow
up
once
in
a
while
and
get
something
started
we
die
of
he
never
wants
to
go
any
place
and
why
last
evening
just
because
the
car
was
out
of
order
and
that
was
his
fault
too
because
he
ought
to
have
taken
it
to
the
and
had
the
battery
looked
at
and
he
did
want
to
go
down
to
the
movies
on
the
trolley
but
we
went
and
then
there
was
one
of
those
impudent
conductors
and
paul
would
do
a
thing
i
was
standing
on
the
platform
waiting
for
the
people
to
let
me
into
the
car
and
this
beast
this
conductor
hollered
at
me
on
you
move
up
why
i
never
had
anybody
speak
to
me
that
way
in
all
my
life
i
was
so
astonished
i
just
turned
to
him
and
said
i
thought
there
must
be
some
mistake
and
so
i
said
to
him
perfectly
pleasant
you
speaking
to
me
and
he
went
on
and
bellowed
at
me
i
was
you
keeping
the
whole
car
from
starting
he
said
and
then
i
saw
he
was
one
of
these
dirty
hogs
that
kindness
is
wasted
on
and
so
i
stopped
and
looked
right
at
him
and
i
said
beg
your
pardon
i
am
not
doing
anything
of
the
kind
i
said
the
people
ahead
of
me
who
wo
move
up
i
said
furthermore
let
me
tell
you
young
man
that
you
a
impertinent
skunk
i
said
you
no
gentleman
i
certainly
intend
to
report
you
and
see
i
said
a
lady
is
to
be
insulted
by
any
drunken
bum
that
chooses
to
put
on
a
ragged
uniform
and
i
thank
you
i
said
keep
your
filthy
abuse
to
yourself
and
then
i
waited
for
paul
to
show
he
was
half
a
man
and
come
to
my
defense
and
he
just
stood
there
and
pretended
he
had
heard
a
word
and
so
i
said
to
him
i
said
oh
cut
it
cut
it
zill
paul
groaned
we
all
know
i
a
mollycoddle
and
you
a
tender
bud
and
let
let
it
go
at
let
it
go
zilla
face
was
wrinkled
like
the
medusa
her
voice
was
a
dagger
of
corroded
brass
she
was
full
of
the
joy
of
righteousness
and
bad
temper
she
was
a
crusader
and
like
every
crusader
she
exulted
in
the
opportunity
to
be
vicious
in
the
name
of
virtue
let
it
go
if
people
knew
how
many
things
i
let
go
oh
quit
being
such
a
yes
a
fine
figure
you
cut
if
i
did
bully
you
you
lie
abed
till
noon
and
play
your
idiotic
fiddle
till
midnight
you
born
lazy
and
you
born
shiftless
and
you
born
cowardly
paul
riesling
oh
now
do
say
that
zilla
you
do
mean
a
word
of
it
protested
babbitt
i
will
say
that
and
i
mean
every
single
last
word
of
it
oh
now
zilla
the
idea
babbitt
was
maternal
and
fussy
she
was
no
older
than
zilla
but
she
seemed
so
at
first
she
was
placid
and
puffy
and
mature
where
zilla
at
was
so
bleached
and
that
you
knew
only
that
she
was
older
than
she
looked
the
idea
of
talking
to
poor
paul
like
that
poor
paul
is
right
we
both
be
poor
we
be
in
the
poorhouse
if
i
did
jazz
him
up
why
now
zilla
georgie
and
i
were
just
saying
how
hard
paul
been
working
all
year
and
we
were
thinking
it
would
be
lovely
if
the
boys
could
run
off
by
themselves
i
been
coaxing
george
to
go
up
to
maine
ahead
of
the
rest
of
us
and
get
the
tired
out
of
his
system
before
we
come
and
i
think
it
would
be
lovely
if
paul
could
manage
to
get
away
and
join
at
this
exposure
of
his
plot
to
escape
paul
was
startled
out
of
impassivity
he
rubbed
his
fingers
his
hands
twitched
zilla
bayed
yes
you
lucky
you
can
let
george
go
and
not
have
to
watch
him
fat
old
georgie
never
peeps
at
another
woman
has
got
the
spunk
the
hell
i
have
babbitt
was
fervently
defending
his
priceless
immorality
when
paul
interrupted
him
and
paul
looked
dangerous
he
rose
quickly
he
said
gently
to
zilla
i
suppose
you
imply
i
have
a
lot
of
yes
i
do
well
then
my
dear
since
you
ask
for
it
there
has
been
a
time
in
the
last
ten
years
when
i
have
found
some
nice
little
girl
to
comfort
me
and
as
long
as
you
continue
your
amiability
i
shall
probably
continue
to
deceive
you
it
is
hard
you
so
zilla
gibbered
she
howled
words
could
not
be
distinguished
in
her
slaver
of
abuse
then
the
bland
george
babbitt
was
transformed
if
paul
was
dangerous
if
zilla
was
a
fury
if
the
neat
emotions
suitable
to
the
revelstoke
arms
had
been
slashed
into
raw
hatreds
it
was
babbitt
who
was
the
most
formidable
he
leaped
up
he
seemed
very
large
he
seized
zilla
shoulder
the
cautions
of
the
broker
were
wiped
from
his
face
and
his
voice
was
cruel
i
had
enough
of
all
this
damn
nonsense
i
known
you
for
years
zil
and
i
never
knew
you
to
miss
a
chance
to
take
your
disappointments
out
on
paul
you
not
wicked
you
worse
you
a
fool
and
let
me
tell
you
that
paul
is
the
finest
boy
god
ever
made
every
decent
person
is
sick
and
tired
of
your
taking
advantage
of
being
a
woman
and
springing
every
mean
innuendo
you
can
think
of
who
the
hell
are
you
that
a
person
like
paul
should
have
to
ask
your
permission
to
go
with
me
you
act
like
you
were
a
combination
of
queen
victoria
and
cleopatra
you
fool
ca
you
see
how
people
snicker
at
you
and
sneer
at
you
zilla
was
sobbing
i
never
i
never
nobody
ever
talked
to
me
like
this
in
all
my
life
no
but
that
the
way
they
talk
behind
your
back
always
they
say
you
a
scolding
old
woman
old
by
god
that
cowardly
attack
broke
her
her
eyes
were
blank
she
wept
but
babbitt
glared
stolidly
he
felt
that
he
was
the
official
in
charge
that
paul
and
babbitt
looked
on
him
with
awe
that
he
alone
could
handle
this
case
zilla
writhed
she
begged
oh
they
do
they
certainly
do
i
been
a
bad
woman
i
terribly
sorry
i
kill
myself
i
do
anything
oh
i
what
do
you
want
she
abased
herself
completely
also
she
enjoyed
it
to
the
connoisseur
of
scenes
nothing
is
more
enjoyable
than
a
thorough
melodramatic
egoistic
humility
i
want
you
to
let
paul
beat
it
off
to
maine
with
me
babbitt
demanded
how
can
i
help
his
going
you
just
said
i
was
an
idiot
and
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
oh
you
can
help
it
all
right
all
right
what
you
got
to
do
is
to
cut
out
hinting
that
the
minute
he
gets
out
of
your
sight
he
go
chasing
after
some
petticoat
matter
fact
that
the
way
you
start
the
boy
off
wrong
you
ought
to
have
more
sense
oh
i
will
honestly
i
will
george
i
know
i
was
bad
oh
forgive
me
all
of
you
forgive
me
she
enjoyed
it
so
did
babbitt
he
condemned
magnificently
and
forgave
piously
and
as
he
went
parading
out
with
his
wife
he
was
grandly
explanatory
to
her
kind
of
a
shame
to
bully
zilla
but
course
it
was
the
only
way
to
handle
her
gosh
i
certainly
did
have
her
crawling
she
said
calmly
yes
you
were
horrid
you
were
showing
off
you
were
having
a
lovely
time
thinking
what
a
great
fine
person
you
were
well
by
golly
can
you
beat
it
of
course
i
might
of
expected
you
to
not
stand
by
me
i
might
of
expected
you
stick
up
for
your
own
sex
yes
poor
zilla
she
so
unhappy
she
takes
it
out
on
paul
she
a
single
thing
to
do
in
that
little
flat
and
she
broods
too
much
and
she
used
to
be
so
pretty
and
gay
and
she
resents
losing
it
and
you
were
just
as
nasty
and
mean
as
you
could
be
i
not
a
bit
proud
of
you
or
of
paul
boasting
about
his
horrid
he
was
sulkily
silent
he
maintained
his
bad
temper
at
a
high
level
of
outraged
nobility
all
the
four
blocks
home
at
the
door
he
left
her
in
haughtiness
and
tramped
the
lawn
with
a
shock
it
was
revealed
to
him
gosh
i
wonder
if
she
was
right
if
she
was
partly
right
overwork
must
have
flayed
him
to
abnormal
sensitiveness
it
was
one
of
the
few
times
in
his
life
when
he
had
queried
his
eternal
excellence
and
he
perceived
the
summer
night
smelled
the
wet
grass
then
i
do
care
i
pulled
it
off
going
to
have
our
spree
and
for
paul
i
do
ii
they
were
buying
their
maine
tackle
at
ijams
brothers
the
sporting
goods
mart
with
the
help
of
willis
ijams
fellow
member
of
the
boosters
club
babbitt
was
completely
mad
he
trumpeted
and
danced
he
muttered
to
paul
say
this
is
pretty
good
eh
to
be
buying
the
stuff
eh
and
good
old
willis
ijams
himself
coming
down
on
the
floor
to
wait
on
us
say
if
those
fellows
that
are
getting
their
kit
for
the
north
lakes
knew
we
were
going
clear
up
to
maine
they
have
a
fit
eh
well
come
on
brother
ijams
willis
i
mean
here
your
chance
a
couple
of
easy
marks
whee
let
me
at
it
i
going
to
buy
out
the
store
he
gloated
on
and
gorgeous
rubber
on
tents
with
celluloid
windows
and
folding
chairs
and
he
wanted
to
buy
all
of
them
it
was
the
paul
whom
he
was
always
vaguely
protecting
who
kept
him
from
his
drunken
desires
but
even
paul
lightened
when
willis
ijams
a
salesman
with
poetry
and
diplomacy
discussed
flies
now
of
course
you
boys
he
said
the
great
scrap
is
between
dry
flies
and
wet
flies
personally
i
for
dry
flies
more
that
so
lots
more
sporting
fulminated
babbitt
who
knew
very
little
about
flies
either
wet
or
dry
now
if
you
take
my
advice
georgie
you
stock
up
well
on
these
pale
evening
dims
and
silver
sedges
and
red
ants
oh
boy
there
a
fly
that
red
ant
you
bet
that
what
it
is
a
fly
rejoiced
babbitt
yes
sir
that
red
ant
said
ijams
is
a
real
fly
oh
i
guess
ole
trout
wo
come
when
i
drop
one
of
those
red
ants
on
the
water
asserted
babbitt
and
his
thick
wrists
made
a
rapturous
motion
of
casting
yes
and
the
landlocked
salmon
will
take
it
too
said
ijams
who
had
never
seen
a
landlocked
salmon
salmon
trout
say
paul
can
you
see
uncle
george
with
his
khaki
pants
on
haulin
in
some
morning
seven
whee
iii
they
were
on
the
new
york
express
incredibly
bound
for
maine
incredibly
without
their
families
they
were
free
in
a
man
world
in
the
of
the
pullman
outside
the
car
window
was
a
glaze
of
darkness
stippled
with
the
gold
of
infrequent
mysterious
lights
babbitt
was
immensely
conscious
in
the
sway
and
authoritative
clatter
of
the
train
of
going
of
going
on
leaning
toward
paul
he
grunted
gosh
pretty
nice
to
be
hiking
eh
the
small
room
with
its
walls
of
steel
was
filled
mostly
with
the
sort
of
men
he
classified
as
the
best
fellows
you
ever
meet
real
good
mixers
there
were
four
of
them
on
the
long
seat
a
fat
man
with
a
shrewd
fat
face
a
man
in
a
green
velour
hat
a
very
young
young
man
with
an
imitation
amber
and
babbitt
facing
them
on
two
movable
leather
chairs
were
paul
and
a
lanky
man
very
cunning
with
wrinkles
bracketing
his
mouth
they
all
read
newspapers
or
trade
journals
journals
crockery
journals
and
waited
for
the
joys
of
conversation
it
was
the
very
young
man
now
making
his
first
journey
by
pullman
who
began
it
say
gee
i
had
a
wild
old
time
in
zenith
he
gloried
say
if
a
fellow
knows
the
ropes
there
he
can
have
as
wild
a
time
as
he
can
in
new
york
yuh
i
bet
you
simply
raised
the
old
ned
i
figured
you
were
a
bad
man
when
i
saw
you
get
on
the
train
chuckled
the
fat
one
the
others
delightedly
laid
down
their
papers
well
that
all
right
now
i
guess
i
seen
some
things
in
the
arbor
you
never
seen
complained
the
boy
oh
i
bet
you
did
i
bet
you
lapped
up
the
malted
milk
like
a
little
devil
then
the
boy
having
served
as
introduction
they
ignored
him
and
charged
into
real
talk
only
paul
sitting
by
himself
reading
at
a
serial
story
in
a
newspaper
failed
to
join
them
and
all
but
babbitt
regarded
him
as
a
snob
an
eccentric
a
person
of
no
spirit
which
of
them
said
which
has
never
been
determined
and
does
not
matter
since
they
all
had
the
same
ideas
and
expressed
them
always
with
the
same
ponderous
and
brassy
assurance
if
it
was
not
babbitt
who
was
delivering
any
given
verdict
at
least
he
was
beaming
on
the
chancellor
who
did
deliver
it
at
that
though
announced
the
first
they
selling
quite
some
booze
in
zenith
guess
they
are
everywhere
i
do
know
how
you
fellows
feel
about
prohibition
but
the
way
it
strikes
me
is
that
it
a
mighty
beneficial
thing
for
the
poor
zob
that
has
got
any
but
for
fellows
like
us
it
an
infringement
of
personal
that
a
fact
congress
has
got
no
right
to
interfere
with
a
personal
liberty
contended
the
second
a
man
came
in
from
the
car
but
as
all
the
seats
were
full
he
stood
up
while
he
smoked
his
cigarette
he
was
an
outsider
he
was
not
one
of
the
old
families
of
the
they
looked
upon
him
bleakly
and
after
trying
to
appear
at
ease
by
examining
his
chin
in
the
mirror
he
gave
it
up
and
went
out
in
silence
just
been
making
a
trip
through
the
south
business
conditions
not
very
good
down
there
said
one
of
the
council
is
that
a
fact
not
very
good
eh
no
did
strike
me
they
were
up
to
not
up
to
normal
eh
no
i
would
hardly
say
they
the
whole
council
nodded
sagely
and
decided
yump
not
hardly
up
to
well
business
conditions
ai
what
they
ought
to
be
out
west
neither
not
by
a
long
that
a
fact
and
i
guess
the
hotel
business
feels
it
that
one
good
thing
though
these
hotels
that
been
charging
five
bucks
a
day
yes
and
maybe
six
seven
for
a
rotten
room
are
going
to
be
darn
glad
to
get
four
and
maybe
give
you
a
little
that
a
fact
say
uh
speaknubout
hotels
i
hit
the
francis
at
san
francisco
for
the
first
time
the
other
day
and
say
it
certainly
is
a
you
right
brother
the
francis
is
a
swell
place
absolutely
that
a
fact
i
right
with
you
it
a
yuh
but
say
any
of
you
fellows
ever
stay
at
the
rippleton
in
chicago
i
do
want
to
knock
i
believe
in
boosting
wherever
you
can
but
say
of
all
the
rotten
dumps
that
pass
off
as
hotels
that
the
worst
i
going
to
get
those
guys
one
of
these
days
and
i
told
so
you
know
how
i
am
well
maybe
you
do
know
but
i
accustomed
to
accommodations
and
perfectly
willing
to
pay
a
reasonable
price
i
got
into
chicago
late
the
other
night
and
the
rippleton
near
the
station
i
never
been
there
before
but
i
says
to
the
i
always
believe
in
taking
a
taxi
when
you
get
in
late
may
cost
a
little
more
money
but
gosh
worth
it
when
you
got
to
be
up
early
next
morning
and
out
selling
a
lot
of
crabs
and
i
said
to
him
just
drive
me
over
to
the
rippleton
well
we
got
there
and
i
breezed
up
to
the
desk
and
said
to
the
clerk
brother
got
a
nice
room
with
bath
for
cousin
bill
saaaay
you
thought
i
sold
him
a
second
or
asked
him
to
work
on
yom
kippur
he
hands
me
the
stare
and
yaps
dunno
friend
i
see
and
he
ducks
behind
the
rigamajig
they
keep
track
of
the
rooms
on
well
i
guess
he
called
up
the
credit
association
and
the
american
security
league
to
see
if
i
was
all
right
he
certainly
took
long
enough
or
maybe
he
just
went
to
sleep
but
finally
he
comes
out
and
looks
at
me
like
it
hurts
him
and
croaks
think
i
can
let
you
have
a
room
with
bath
that
awful
nice
of
you
sorry
to
trouble
you
how
much
it
set
me
back
i
says
real
sweet
cost
you
seven
bucks
a
day
friend
he
says
well
it
was
late
and
anyway
it
went
down
on
my
gosh
if
i
been
paying
it
instead
of
the
firm
tramped
the
streets
all
night
before
i
let
any
hick
tavern
stick
me
seven
great
big
round
dollars
believe
me
so
i
lets
it
go
at
that
well
the
clerk
wakes
a
nice
young
bell
hop
fine
lad
not
a
day
over
years
old
fought
at
the
battle
of
gettysburg
and
does
know
it
over
yet
thought
i
was
one
of
the
confederates
i
guess
from
the
way
he
looked
at
me
and
rip
van
winkle
took
me
up
to
something
i
found
out
afterwards
they
called
it
a
room
but
first
i
thought
there
been
some
mistake
i
thought
they
were
putting
me
in
the
salvation
army
at
seven
per
each
and
every
diem
gosh
yuh
i
heard
the
rippleton
was
pretty
cheesy
now
when
i
go
to
chicago
i
always
stay
at
the
blackstone
or
the
la
salle
say
any
of
you
fellows
ever
stay
at
the
birchdale
at
terre
haute
how
is
it
oh
the
birchdale
is
a
twelve
minutes
of
conference
on
the
state
of
hotels
in
south
bend
flint
dayton
tulsa
wichita
fort
worth
winona
erie
fargo
and
moose
jaw
speaknubout
prices
the
man
in
the
velour
hat
observed
fingering
the
on
his
heavy
i
like
to
know
where
they
get
this
stuff
about
clothes
coming
down
now
you
take
this
suit
i
got
he
pinched
his
four
years
ago
i
paid
fifty
for
it
and
it
was
real
value
well
here
the
other
day
i
went
into
a
store
back
home
and
asked
to
see
a
suit
and
the
fellow
yanks
out
some
that
honest
i
would
put
on
a
hired
man
just
out
of
curiosity
i
asks
him
you
charging
for
that
junk
he
says
d
you
mean
junk
that
a
swell
piece
of
goods
all
wool
like
hell
it
was
nice
vegetable
wool
right
off
the
ole
plantation
all
wool
he
says
we
get
ninety
for
it
you
do
do
you
i
says
from
me
you
do
i
says
and
i
walks
right
out
on
him
you
bet
i
says
to
the
wife
i
said
long
as
your
strength
holds
out
and
you
can
go
on
putting
a
few
more
patches
on
papa
pants
we
just
pass
up
buying
that
right
brother
and
just
look
at
collars
frinstance
hey
wait
the
fat
man
protested
what
the
matter
with
collars
selling
collars
d
you
realize
the
cost
of
labor
on
collars
is
still
two
hundred
and
seven
per
cent
above
they
voted
that
if
their
old
friend
the
fat
man
sold
collars
then
the
price
of
collars
was
exactly
what
it
should
be
but
all
other
clothing
was
tragically
too
expensive
they
admired
and
loved
one
another
now
they
went
profoundly
into
the
science
of
business
and
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
a
plow
or
a
brick
was
so
that
it
might
be
sold
to
them
the
romantic
hero
was
no
longer
the
knight
the
wandering
poet
the
cowpuncher
the
aviator
nor
the
brave
young
district
attorney
but
the
great
who
had
an
analysis
of
merchandizing
problems
on
his
desk
whose
title
of
nobility
was
and
who
devoted
himself
and
all
his
young
samurai
to
the
cosmic
purpose
of
selling
not
of
selling
anything
in
particular
for
or
to
anybody
in
particular
but
pure
selling
the
roused
paul
riesling
though
he
was
a
player
of
violins
and
an
interestingly
unhappy
husband
he
was
also
a
very
able
salesman
of
he
listened
to
the
fat
man
remarks
on
the
value
of
and
bulletins
as
a
method
of
the
boys
out
on
the
road
and
he
himself
offered
one
or
two
excellent
thoughts
on
the
use
of
stamps
on
circulars
then
he
committed
an
offense
against
the
holy
law
of
the
clan
of
good
fellows
he
became
highbrow
they
were
entering
a
city
on
the
outskirts
they
passed
a
which
flared
in
scarlet
and
orange
flame
that
licked
at
the
cadaverous
stacks
at
the
walls
and
sullen
converters
my
lord
look
at
that
beautiful
said
paul
you
bet
it
beautiful
friend
that
the
steel
plant
and
they
tell
me
old
john
shelling
made
a
good
three
million
bones
out
of
munitions
during
the
war
the
man
with
the
velour
hat
said
reverently
i
did
mean
i
mean
it
lovely
the
way
the
light
pulls
that
picturesque
yard
all
littered
with
junk
right
out
of
the
darkness
said
paul
they
stared
at
him
while
babbitt
crowed
paul
there
has
certainly
got
one
great
little
eye
for
picturesque
places
and
quaint
sights
and
all
that
stuff
of
been
an
author
or
something
if
he
had
gone
into
the
roofing
paul
looked
annoyed
babbitt
sometimes
wondered
if
paul
appreciated
his
loyal
boosting
the
man
in
the
velour
hat
grunted
well
personally
i
think
keep
their
works
awful
dirty
bum
routing
but
i
do
suppose
there
any
law
against
calling
if
it
gets
you
that
way
paul
sulkily
returned
to
his
newspaper
and
the
conversation
logically
moved
on
to
trains
what
time
do
we
get
into
pittsburg
asked
babbitt
pittsburg
i
think
we
get
in
at
no
that
was
last
schedule
wait
a
minute
let
see
got
a
right
i
wonder
if
we
on
time
yuh
sure
we
must
be
just
about
on
no
we
are
we
were
seven
minutes
late
last
were
we
straight
why
gosh
i
thought
we
were
right
on
no
we
about
seven
minutes
yuh
that
right
seven
minutes
the
porter
entered
a
negro
in
white
jacket
with
brass
buttons
how
late
are
we
george
growled
the
fat
man
i
do
know
sir
i
think
we
about
on
time
said
the
porter
folding
towels
and
deftly
tossing
them
up
on
the
rack
above
the
washbowls
the
council
stared
at
him
gloomily
and
when
he
was
gone
they
wailed
i
do
know
what
come
over
these
niggers
nowadays
they
never
give
you
a
civil
that
a
fact
they
getting
so
they
do
have
a
single
bit
of
respect
for
you
the
coon
was
a
fine
old
cuss
he
knew
his
place
but
these
young
dinges
do
want
to
be
porters
or
oh
no
they
got
to
be
lawyers
and
professors
and
lord
knows
what
all
i
tell
you
it
becoming
a
pretty
serious
problem
we
ought
to
get
together
and
show
the
black
man
yes
and
the
yellow
man
his
place
now
i
have
got
one
particle
of
i
the
first
to
be
glad
when
a
nigger
succeeds
so
long
as
he
stays
where
he
belongs
and
does
try
to
usurp
the
rightful
authority
and
business
ability
of
the
white
that
the
and
another
thing
we
got
to
do
said
the
man
with
the
velour
hat
whose
name
was
koplinsky
is
to
keep
these
damn
foreigners
out
of
the
country
thank
the
lord
we
putting
a
limit
on
immigration
these
dagoes
and
hunkies
have
got
to
learn
that
this
is
a
white
man
country
and
they
ai
wanted
here
when
we
assimilated
the
foreigners
we
got
here
now
and
learned
the
principles
of
americanism
and
turned
into
regular
folks
why
then
maybe
we
let
in
a
few
you
bet
that
a
fact
they
observed
and
passed
on
to
lighter
topics
they
rapidly
reviewed
prices
fishing
and
the
prospects
for
the
in
dakota
but
the
fat
man
was
impatient
at
this
waste
of
time
he
was
a
veteran
traveler
and
free
of
illusions
already
he
had
asserted
that
he
was
an
old
he
leaned
forward
gathered
in
their
attention
by
his
expression
of
sly
humor
and
grumbled
oh
hell
boys
let
cut
out
the
formality
and
get
down
to
the
stories
they
became
very
lively
and
intimate
paul
and
the
boy
vanished
the
others
slid
forward
on
the
long
seat
unbuttoned
their
vests
thrust
their
feet
up
on
the
chairs
pulled
the
stately
brass
cuspidors
nearer
and
ran
the
green
down
on
its
little
trolley
to
shut
them
in
from
the
uncomfortable
strangeness
of
night
after
each
bark
of
laughter
they
cried
say
jever
hear
the
one
about
babbitt
was
expansive
and
virile
when
the
train
stopped
at
an
important
station
the
four
men
walked
up
and
down
the
cement
platform
under
the
vast
smoky
roof
like
a
stormy
sky
under
the
elevated
footways
beside
crates
of
ducks
and
sides
of
beef
in
the
mystery
of
an
unknown
city
they
strolled
abreast
old
friends
and
well
content
at
the
alllll
aboarrrrrd
like
a
mountain
call
at
dusk
they
hastened
back
into
the
and
till
two
of
the
morning
continued
the
droll
tales
their
eyes
damp
with
and
laughter
when
they
parted
they
shook
hands
and
chuckled
well
sir
it
been
a
great
session
sorry
to
bust
it
up
mighty
glad
to
met
babbitt
lay
awake
in
the
close
hot
tomb
of
his
pullman
berth
shaking
with
remembrance
of
the
fat
man
limerick
about
the
lady
who
wished
to
be
wild
he
raised
the
shade
he
lay
with
a
puffy
arm
tucked
between
his
head
and
the
skimpy
pillow
looking
out
on
the
sliding
silhouettes
of
trees
and
village
lamps
like
he
was
very
happy
chapter
xi
i
they
had
four
hours
in
new
york
between
trains
the
one
thing
babbitt
wished
to
see
was
the
pennsylvania
hotel
which
had
been
built
since
his
last
visit
he
stared
up
at
it
muttering
hundred
rooms
and
hundred
baths
that
got
everything
in
the
world
beat
lord
their
turnover
must
be
well
suppose
price
of
rooms
is
four
to
eight
dollars
a
day
and
i
suppose
maybe
some
ten
and
four
times
six
times
hundred
well
anyway
with
restaurants
and
everything
say
summers
between
eight
and
fifteen
thousand
a
day
every
day
i
never
thought
i
see
a
thing
like
that
some
town
of
course
the
average
fellow
in
zenith
has
got
more
individual
initiative
than
the
fourflushers
here
but
i
got
to
hand
it
to
new
york
yes
sir
town
you
all
right
some
ways
well
old
paulski
i
guess
seen
everything
that
worth
while
how
we
kill
the
rest
of
the
time
movie
but
paul
desired
to
see
a
liner
always
wanted
to
go
to
europe
and
by
thunder
i
will
too
some
day
before
i
past
out
he
sighed
from
a
rough
wharf
on
the
north
river
they
stared
at
the
stern
of
the
aquitania
and
her
stacks
and
wireless
antenna
lifted
above
the
which
shut
her
in
by
golly
babbitt
droned
would
be
so
bad
to
go
over
to
the
old
country
and
take
a
squint
at
all
these
ruins
and
the
place
where
shakespeare
was
born
and
think
of
being
able
to
order
a
drink
whenever
you
wanted
one
just
range
up
to
a
bar
and
holler
out
loud
gim
me
a
cocktail
and
darn
the
police
not
bad
at
all
what
juh
like
to
see
over
there
paulibus
paul
did
not
answer
babbitt
turned
paul
was
standing
with
clenched
fists
head
drooping
staring
at
the
liner
as
in
terror
his
thin
body
seen
against
the
planks
of
the
wharf
was
childishly
meager
again
what
would
you
hit
for
on
the
other
side
paul
scowling
at
the
steamer
his
breast
heaving
paul
whispered
oh
my
god
while
babbitt
watched
him
anxiously
he
snapped
come
on
get
out
of
this
and
hastened
down
the
wharf
not
looking
back
that
funny
considered
babbitt
the
boy
did
care
for
seeing
the
ocean
boats
after
all
i
thought
he
be
interested
in
ii
though
he
exulted
and
made
sage
speculations
about
locomotive
as
their
train
climbed
the
maine
and
from
the
summit
he
looked
down
the
shining
way
among
the
pines
though
he
remarked
well
by
golly
when
he
discovered
that
the
station
at
katadumcook
the
end
of
the
line
was
an
aged
moment
of
impassioned
release
came
when
they
sat
on
a
tiny
wharf
on
lake
sunasquam
awaiting
the
launch
from
the
hotel
a
raft
had
floated
down
the
lake
between
the
logs
and
the
shore
the
water
was
transparent
flashing
with
minnows
a
guide
in
black
felt
hat
with
in
the
band
and
flannel
shirt
of
a
peculiarly
daring
blue
sat
on
a
log
and
whittled
and
was
silent
a
dog
a
good
country
dog
black
and
woolly
gray
a
dog
rich
in
leisure
and
in
meditation
scratched
and
grunted
and
slept
the
thick
sunlight
was
lavish
on
the
bright
water
on
the
rim
of
balsam
boughs
the
silver
birches
and
tropic
ferns
and
across
the
lake
it
burned
on
the
sturdy
shoulders
of
the
mountains
over
everything
was
a
holy
peace
silent
they
loafed
on
the
edge
of
the
wharf
swinging
their
legs
above
the
water
the
immense
tenderness
of
the
place
sank
into
babbitt
and
he
murmured
i
just
like
to
sit
here
the
rest
of
my
life
and
whittle
and
sit
and
never
hear
a
typewriter
or
stan
graff
fussing
in
the
or
rone
and
ted
scrapping
just
sit
gosh
he
patted
paul
shoulder
how
does
it
strike
you
old
snoozer
oh
it
darn
good
georgie
there
something
sort
of
eternal
about
for
once
babbitt
understood
him
iii
their
launch
rounded
the
bend
at
the
head
of
the
lake
under
a
mountain
slope
they
saw
the
little
central
of
their
hotel
and
the
crescent
of
squat
log
cottages
which
served
as
bedrooms
they
landed
and
endured
the
critical
examination
of
the
habitues
who
had
been
at
the
hotel
for
a
whole
week
in
their
cottage
with
its
high
stone
fireplace
they
hastened
as
babbitt
expressed
it
to
get
into
some
regular
they
came
out
paul
in
an
old
gray
suit
and
soft
white
shirt
babbitt
in
khaki
shirt
and
vast
and
flapping
khaki
trousers
it
was
excessively
new
khaki
his
rimless
spectacles
belonged
to
a
city
office
and
his
face
was
not
tanned
but
a
city
pink
he
made
a
discordant
noise
in
the
place
but
with
infinite
satisfaction
he
slapped
his
legs
and
crowed
say
this
is
getting
back
home
eh
they
stood
on
the
wharf
before
the
hotel
he
winked
at
paul
and
drew
from
his
back
pocket
a
plug
of
a
vulgarism
forbidden
in
the
babbitt
home
he
took
a
chew
beaming
and
wagging
his
head
as
he
tugged
at
it
um
um
maybe
i
have
been
hungry
for
a
wad
of
have
some
they
looked
at
each
other
in
a
grin
of
understanding
paul
took
the
plug
gnawed
at
it
they
stood
quiet
their
jaws
working
they
solemnly
spat
one
after
the
other
into
the
placid
water
they
stretched
voluptuously
with
lifted
arms
and
arched
backs
from
beyond
the
mountains
came
the
shuffling
sound
of
a
train
a
trout
leaped
and
fell
back
in
a
silver
circle
they
sighed
together
iv
they
had
a
week
before
their
families
came
each
evening
they
planned
to
get
up
early
and
fish
before
breakfast
each
morning
they
lay
abed
till
the
pleasantly
conscious
that
there
were
no
efficient
wives
to
rouse
them
the
mornings
were
cold
the
fire
was
kindly
as
they
dressed
paul
was
distressingly
clean
but
babbitt
reveled
in
a
good
sound
dirtiness
in
not
having
to
shave
till
his
spirit
was
moved
to
it
he
treasured
every
grease
spot
and
on
his
new
khaki
trousers
all
morning
they
fished
unenergetically
or
tramped
the
dim
and
trails
among
rank
ferns
and
moss
sprinkled
with
crimson
bells
they
slept
all
afternoon
and
till
midnight
played
with
the
guides
poker
was
a
serious
business
to
the
guides
they
did
not
gossip
they
shuffled
the
thick
greasy
cards
with
a
deft
ferocity
menacing
to
the
sports
and
joe
paradise
king
of
guides
was
sarcastic
to
loiterers
who
halted
the
game
even
to
scratch
at
midnight
as
paul
and
he
blundered
to
their
cottage
over
the
pungent
wet
grass
and
confusing
in
the
darkness
babbitt
rejoiced
that
he
did
not
have
to
explain
to
his
wife
where
he
had
been
all
evening
they
did
not
talk
much
the
nervous
loquacity
and
opinionation
of
the
zenith
athletic
club
dropped
from
them
but
when
they
did
talk
they
slipped
into
the
naive
intimacy
of
college
days
once
they
drew
their
canoe
up
to
the
bank
of
sunasquam
water
a
stream
walled
in
by
the
dense
green
of
the
hardhack
the
sun
roared
on
the
green
jungle
but
in
the
shade
was
sleepy
peace
and
the
water
was
golden
and
rippling
babbitt
drew
his
hand
through
the
cool
flood
and
mused
we
never
thought
we
come
to
maine
together
no
we
never
done
anything
the
way
we
thought
we
would
i
expected
to
live
in
germany
with
my
granddad
people
and
study
the
that
so
and
remember
how
i
wanted
to
be
a
lawyer
and
go
into
politics
i
still
think
i
might
have
made
a
go
of
it
i
kind
of
got
the
gift
of
the
gab
anyway
i
can
think
on
my
feet
and
make
some
kind
of
a
spiel
on
most
anything
and
of
course
that
the
thing
you
need
in
politics
by
golly
ted
going
to
even
if
i
did
well
i
guess
it
worked
out
all
right
myra
been
a
fine
wife
and
zilla
means
well
yes
up
here
i
figure
out
all
sorts
of
plans
to
keep
her
amused
i
kind
of
feel
life
is
going
to
be
different
now
that
we
getting
a
good
rest
and
can
go
back
and
start
over
i
hope
so
old
shyly
say
gosh
it
been
awful
nice
to
sit
around
and
loaf
and
gamble
and
act
regular
with
you
along
you
old
well
you
know
what
it
means
to
me
georgie
saved
my
the
shame
of
emotion
overpowered
them
they
cursed
a
little
to
prove
they
were
good
rough
fellows
and
in
a
mellow
silence
babbitt
whistling
while
paul
hummed
they
paddled
back
to
the
hotel
v
though
it
was
paul
who
had
seemed
overwrought
babbitt
who
had
been
the
protecting
big
brother
paul
became
and
merry
while
babbitt
sank
into
irritability
he
uncovered
layer
on
layer
of
hidden
weariness
at
first
he
had
played
nimble
jester
to
paul
and
for
him
sought
amusements
by
the
end
of
the
week
paul
was
nurse
and
babbitt
accepted
favors
with
the
condescension
one
always
shows
a
patient
nurse
the
day
before
their
families
arrived
the
women
guests
at
the
hotel
bubbled
oh
is
it
nice
you
must
be
so
excited
and
the
proprieties
compelled
babbitt
and
paul
to
look
excited
but
they
went
to
bed
early
and
grumpy
when
myra
appeared
she
said
at
once
now
we
want
you
boys
to
go
on
playing
around
just
as
if
we
were
the
first
evening
he
stayed
out
for
poker
with
the
guides
and
she
said
in
placid
merriment
my
you
a
regular
bad
one
the
second
evening
she
groaned
sleepily
good
heavens
are
you
going
to
be
out
every
single
night
the
third
evening
he
did
play
poker
he
was
tired
now
in
every
cell
funny
vacation
does
seem
to
have
done
me
a
bit
of
good
he
lamented
paul
frisky
as
a
colt
but
i
swear
i
crankier
and
nervouser
than
when
i
came
up
he
had
three
weeks
of
maine
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
he
began
to
feel
calm
and
interested
in
life
he
planned
an
expedition
to
climb
sachem
mountain
and
wanted
to
camp
overnight
at
box
car
pond
he
was
curiously
weak
yet
cheerful
as
though
he
had
cleansed
his
veins
of
poisonous
energy
and
was
filling
them
with
wholesome
blood
he
ceased
to
be
irritated
by
ted
infatuation
with
a
waitress
his
seventh
tragic
affair
this
year
he
played
catch
with
ted
and
with
pride
taught
him
to
cast
a
fly
in
the
silence
of
skowtuit
pond
at
the
end
he
sighed
hang
it
i
just
beginning
to
enjoy
my
vacation
but
well
i
feel
a
lot
better
and
it
going
to
be
one
great
year
maybe
the
real
estate
board
will
elect
me
president
instead
of
some
fuzzy
faker
like
chan
on
the
way
home
whenever
he
went
into
the
he
felt
guilty
at
deserting
his
wife
and
angry
at
being
expected
to
feel
guilty
but
each
time
he
triumphed
oh
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
year
a
great
old
year
chapter
xii
i
all
the
way
home
from
maine
babbitt
was
certain
that
he
was
a
changed
man
he
was
converted
to
serenity
he
was
going
to
cease
worrying
about
business
he
was
going
to
have
more
interests
theaters
public
affairs
reading
and
suddenly
as
he
finished
an
especially
heavy
cigar
he
was
going
to
stop
smoking
he
invented
a
new
and
perfect
method
he
would
buy
no
tobacco
he
would
depend
on
borrowing
it
and
of
course
he
would
be
ashamed
to
borrow
often
in
a
spasm
of
righteousness
he
flung
his
out
of
the
window
he
went
back
and
was
kind
to
his
wife
about
nothing
in
particular
he
admired
his
own
purity
and
decided
absolutely
simple
just
a
matter
of
he
started
a
magazine
serial
about
a
scientific
detective
ten
miles
on
he
was
conscious
that
he
desired
to
smoke
he
ducked
his
head
like
a
turtle
going
into
its
shell
he
appeared
uneasy
he
skipped
two
pages
in
his
story
and
know
it
five
miles
later
he
leaped
up
and
sought
the
porter
say
uh
george
have
you
got
a
the
porter
looked
patient
have
you
got
a
babbitt
finished
at
the
next
stop
he
went
out
and
bought
a
cigar
since
it
was
to
be
his
last
before
he
reached
zenith
he
finished
it
down
to
an
inch
stub
four
days
later
he
again
remembered
that
he
had
stopped
smoking
but
he
was
too
busy
catching
up
with
his
to
keep
it
remembered
ii
baseball
he
determined
would
be
an
excellent
hobby
no
sense
a
working
his
fool
head
off
i
going
out
to
the
game
three
times
a
week
besides
fellow
ought
to
support
the
home
he
did
go
and
support
the
team
and
enhance
the
glory
of
zenith
by
yelling
attaboy
and
rotten
he
performed
the
rite
scrupulously
he
wore
a
cotton
handkerchief
about
his
collar
he
became
sweaty
he
opened
his
mouth
in
a
wide
loose
grin
and
drank
lemon
soda
out
of
a
bottle
he
went
to
the
game
three
times
a
week
for
one
week
then
he
compromised
on
watching
the
he
stood
in
the
thickest
and
steamiest
of
the
crowd
and
as
the
boy
up
on
the
lofty
platform
recorded
the
achievements
of
big
bill
bostwick
the
pitcher
babbitt
remarked
to
complete
strangers
pretty
nice
good
work
and
hastened
back
to
the
office
he
honestly
believed
that
he
loved
baseball
it
is
true
that
he
had
in
years
himself
played
any
baseball
except
catch
with
ted
very
gentle
and
strictly
limited
to
ten
minutes
but
the
game
was
a
custom
of
his
clan
and
it
gave
outlet
for
the
homicidal
and
instincts
which
babbitt
called
patriotism
and
love
of
as
he
approached
the
office
he
walked
faster
and
faster
muttering
guess
better
all
about
him
the
city
was
hustling
for
hustling
sake
men
in
motors
were
hustling
to
pass
one
another
in
the
hustling
traffic
men
were
hustling
to
catch
trolleys
with
another
trolley
a
minute
behind
and
to
leap
from
the
trolleys
to
gallop
across
the
sidewalk
to
hurl
themselves
into
buildings
into
hustling
express
elevators
men
in
dairy
lunches
were
hustling
to
gulp
down
the
food
which
cooks
had
hustled
to
fry
men
in
barber
shops
were
snapping
shave
me
once
over
got
ta
men
were
feverishly
getting
rid
of
visitors
in
offices
adorned
with
the
signs
this
is
my
busy
day
and
the
lord
created
the
world
in
six
days
you
can
spiel
all
you
got
to
say
in
six
men
who
had
made
five
thousand
year
before
last
and
ten
thousand
last
year
were
urging
on
bodies
and
parched
brains
so
that
they
might
make
twenty
thousand
this
year
and
the
men
who
had
broken
down
immediately
after
making
their
twenty
thousand
dollars
were
hustling
to
catch
trains
to
hustle
through
the
vacations
which
the
hustling
doctors
had
ordered
among
them
babbitt
hustled
back
to
his
office
to
sit
down
with
nothing
much
to
do
except
see
that
the
staff
looked
as
though
they
were
hustling
iii
every
saturday
afternoon
he
hustled
out
to
his
country
club
and
hustled
through
nine
holes
of
golf
as
a
rest
after
the
week
hustle
in
zenith
it
was
as
necessary
for
a
successful
man
to
belong
to
a
country
club
as
it
was
to
wear
a
linen
collar
babbitt
was
the
outing
golf
and
country
club
a
pleasant
building
with
a
broad
porch
on
a
cliff
above
lake
kennepoose
there
was
another
the
tonawanda
country
club
to
which
belonged
charles
mckelvey
horace
updike
and
the
other
rich
men
who
lunched
not
at
the
athletic
but
at
the
union
club
babbitt
explained
with
frequency
you
hire
me
to
join
the
tonawanda
even
if
i
did
have
a
hundred
and
eighty
bucks
to
throw
away
on
the
initiation
fee
at
the
outing
we
got
a
bunch
of
real
human
fellows
and
the
finest
lot
of
little
women
in
town
just
as
good
at
joshing
as
the
men
but
at
the
tonawanda
nothing
but
these
in
new
york
drinking
tea
too
much
dog
altogether
why
i
would
join
the
tonawanda
even
if
they
i
would
join
it
on
a
bet
when
he
had
played
four
or
five
holes
he
relaxed
a
bit
his
heart
beat
more
normally
and
his
voice
slowed
to
the
drawling
of
his
hundred
generations
of
peasant
ancestors
iv
at
least
once
a
week
and
babbitt
and
tinka
went
to
the
movies
their
favorite
theater
was
the
chateau
which
held
three
thousand
spectators
and
had
an
orchestra
of
fifty
pieces
which
played
arrangements
from
the
operas
and
suites
portraying
a
day
on
the
farm
or
a
fire
in
the
stone
rotunda
decorated
with
velvet
chairs
and
almost
medieval
tapestries
parrakeets
sat
on
gilded
lotos
columns
with
exclamations
of
well
by
golly
and
you
got
to
go
some
to
beat
this
dump
babbitt
admired
the
chateau
as
he
stared
across
the
thousands
of
heads
a
gray
plain
in
the
dimness
as
he
smelled
good
clothes
and
mild
perfume
and
he
felt
as
when
he
had
first
seen
a
mountain
and
realized
how
very
very
much
earth
and
rock
there
was
in
it
he
liked
three
kinds
of
films
pretty
bathing
girls
with
bare
legs
policemen
or
cowboys
and
an
industrious
shooting
of
revolvers
and
funny
fat
men
who
ate
spaghetti
he
chuckled
with
immense
sentimentality
at
interludes
portraying
puppies
kittens
and
chubby
babies
and
he
wept
at
deathbeds
and
old
mothers
being
patient
in
mortgaged
cottages
babbitt
preferred
the
pictures
in
which
handsome
young
women
in
elaborate
frocks
moved
through
sets
ticketed
as
the
of
new
york
millionaires
as
for
tinka
she
preferred
or
was
believed
to
prefer
whatever
her
parents
told
her
to
all
his
relaxations
baseball
golf
movies
bridge
motoring
long
talks
with
paul
at
the
athletic
club
or
at
the
good
red
beef
and
old
english
chop
house
were
necessary
to
babbitt
for
he
was
entering
a
year
of
such
activity
as
he
had
never
known
chapter
xiii
i
it
was
by
accident
that
babbitt
had
his
opportunity
to
address
the
b
the
as
its
members
called
it
with
the
universal
passion
for
mysterious
and
initials
was
the
state
association
of
real
estate
boards
the
organization
of
brokers
and
operators
it
was
to
hold
its
annual
convention
at
monarch
chief
rival
among
the
cities
of
the
state
babbitt
was
an
official
delegate
another
was
cecil
rountree
whom
babbitt
admired
for
his
picaresque
speculative
building
and
hated
for
his
social
position
for
being
present
at
the
smartest
dances
on
royal
ridge
rountree
was
chairman
of
the
convention
babbitt
had
growled
to
him
makes
me
tired
the
way
these
doctors
and
profs
and
preachers
put
on
lugs
about
being
men
a
good
realtor
has
to
have
more
knowledge
and
finesse
than
any
of
right
you
are
i
say
why
do
you
put
that
into
a
paper
and
give
it
at
the
e
suggested
rountree
well
if
it
would
help
you
in
making
up
the
program
tell
you
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
this
first
place
we
ought
to
insist
that
folks
call
us
and
not
men
sounds
more
like
a
profession
second
place
what
is
it
distinguishes
a
profession
from
a
mere
trade
business
or
occupation
what
is
it
why
it
the
public
service
and
the
skill
the
trained
skill
and
the
knowledge
and
uh
all
that
whereas
a
fellow
that
merely
goes
out
for
the
jack
he
never
considers
service
and
trained
skill
and
so
on
now
as
a
professional
rather
that
perfectly
bully
perfectly
corking
now
you
write
it
in
a
paper
said
rountree
as
he
rapidly
and
firmly
moved
away
ii
however
accustomed
to
the
literary
labors
of
advertisements
and
correspondence
babbitt
was
dismayed
on
the
evening
when
he
sat
down
to
prepare
a
paper
which
would
take
a
whole
ten
minutes
to
read
he
laid
out
a
new
school
on
his
collapsible
set
up
for
the
event
in
the
the
household
had
been
bullied
into
silence
verona
and
ted
requested
to
disappear
and
tinka
threatened
with
if
i
hear
one
sound
out
of
you
if
you
holler
for
a
glass
of
water
one
single
solitary
time
you
better
not
that
all
babbitt
sat
over
by
the
piano
making
a
nightgown
and
gazing
with
respect
while
babbitt
wrote
in
the
to
the
rhythmical
wiggling
and
squeaking
of
the
when
he
rose
damp
and
jumpy
and
his
throat
dusty
from
cigarettes
she
marveled
i
do
see
how
you
can
just
sit
down
and
make
up
things
right
out
of
your
own
head
oh
it
the
training
in
constructive
imagination
that
a
fellow
gets
in
modern
business
he
had
written
seven
pages
whereof
the
first
page
set
forth
illustration
omitted
consists
of
several
doodles
and
a
profession
not
just
a
trade
crossed
out
skill
vision
shd
be
called
realtor
not
just
real
est
man
the
other
six
pages
were
rather
like
the
first
for
a
week
he
went
about
looking
important
every
morning
as
he
dressed
he
thought
aloud
jever
stop
to
consider
myra
that
before
a
town
can
have
buildings
or
prosperity
or
any
of
those
things
some
realtor
has
got
to
sell
the
land
all
civilization
starts
with
him
jever
realize
that
at
the
athletic
club
he
led
unwilling
men
aside
to
inquire
say
if
you
had
to
read
a
paper
before
a
big
convention
would
you
start
in
with
the
funny
stories
or
just
kind
of
scatter
all
through
he
asked
howard
littlefield
for
a
set
of
statistics
about
sales
something
good
and
impressive
and
littlefield
provided
something
exceedingly
good
and
impressive
but
it
was
to
cholmondeley
frink
that
babbitt
most
often
turned
he
caught
frink
at
the
club
every
noon
and
demanded
while
frink
looked
hunted
and
evasive
say
chum
you
a
shark
on
this
writing
stuff
how
would
you
put
this
sentence
see
here
in
my
manuscript
manuscript
now
where
the
deuce
is
that
oh
yes
here
would
you
say
ought
not
also
to
alone
think
or
ought
also
not
to
think
alone
or
one
evening
when
his
wife
was
away
and
he
had
no
one
to
impress
babbitt
forgot
about
style
order
and
the
other
mysteries
and
scrawled
off
what
he
really
thought
about
the
business
and
about
himself
and
he
found
the
paper
written
when
he
read
it
to
his
wife
she
yearned
why
dear
it
splendid
beautifully
written
and
so
clear
and
interesting
and
such
splendid
ideas
why
it
just
it
just
splendid
next
day
he
cornered
chum
frink
and
crowed
well
old
son
i
finished
it
last
evening
just
lammed
it
out
i
used
to
think
you
must
have
a
hard
job
making
up
pieces
but
lord
it
a
cinch
pretty
soft
for
you
fellows
you
certainly
earn
your
money
easy
some
day
when
i
get
ready
to
retire
guess
i
take
to
writing
and
show
you
boys
how
to
do
it
i
always
used
to
think
i
could
write
better
stuff
and
more
punch
and
originality
than
all
this
stuff
you
see
printed
and
now
doggone
sure
of
it
he
had
four
copies
of
the
paper
typed
in
black
with
a
gorgeous
red
title
had
them
bound
in
pale
blue
manilla
and
affably
presented
one
to
old
ira
runyon
the
managing
editor
of
the
who
said
yes
indeed
yes
he
was
very
glad
to
have
it
and
he
certainly
would
read
it
all
through
as
soon
as
he
could
find
time
babbitt
could
not
go
to
monarch
she
had
a
meeting
babbitt
said
that

was
very
sorry

of

was
such
a

in

by

they
formed
impromptu
processions
through

depicting

as

babbitt
was
stirred
to
hysteric
patriotism
he
leaped
on
a
bench
shouting
to
the
crowd
what
the
matter
with
zenith
she
all
right
what
best
ole
town
in
the
s
the
patient
poor
people
waiting
for
the
midnight
train
stared
in
unenvious
wonder
italian
women
with
shawls
old
weary
men
with
broken
shoes
roving
boys
in
suits
which
had
been
flashy
when
they
were
new
but
which
were
faded
now
and
wrinkled
babbitt
perceived
that
as
an
official
delegate
he
must
be
more
dignified
with
wing
and
rogers
he
tramped
up
and
down
the
cement
platform
beside
the
waiting
pullmans
and
porters
carrying
bags
sped
down
the
platform
with
an
agreeable
effect
of
activity
glared
and
stammered
overhead
the
glossy
yellow
shone
impressively
babbitt
made
his
voice
to
be
measured
and
lordly
he
thrust
out
his
abdomen
and
rumbled
we
got
to
see
to
it
that
the
convention
lets
the
legislature
understand
just
where
they
get
off
in
this
matter
of
taxing
realty
wing
uttered
approving
grunts
and
babbitt
swelled
gloated
the
blind
of
a
pullman
compartment
was
raised
and
babbitt
looked
into
an
unfamiliar
world
the
occupant
of
the
compartment
was
lucile
mckelvey
the
pretty
wife
of
the
millionaire
contractor
possibly
babbitt
thrilled
she
was
going
to
europe
on
the
seat
beside
her
was
a
bunch
of
orchids
and
violets
and
a
yellow
book
which
seemed
foreign
while
he
stared
she
picked
up
the
book
then
glanced
out
of
the
window
as
though
she
was
bored
she
must
have
looked
straight
at
him
and
he
had
met
her
but
she
gave
no
sign
she
languidly
pulled
down
the
blind
and
he
stood
still
a
cold
feeling
of
insignificance
in
his
heart
but
on
the
train
his
pride
was
restored
by
meeting
delegates
from
sparta
pioneer
and
other
smaller
cities
of
the
state
who
listened
respectfully
when
as
a
magnifico
from
the
metropolis
of
zenith
he
explained
politics
and
the
value
of
a
good
sound
business
administration
they
fell
joyfully
into
the
purest
and
most
rapturous
form
of
conversation
how
this
fellow
rountree
make
out
with
this
big
he
was
going
to
put
up
whadde
do
get
out
bonds
to
finance
it
asked
a
sparta
broker
well
i
tell
you
said
babbitt
now
if
i
been
handling
it
so
elbert
wing
was
droning
i
hired
this
for
a
week
and
put
up
a
big
sign
town
for
tiny
tots
and
stuck
in
a
lot
of
doll
houses
and
some
dinky
little
trees
and
then
down
at
the
bottom
likes
this
dollydale
but
papa
and
mama
will
prefer
our
beautiful
bungalows
and
you
know
that
certainly
got
folks
talking
and
first
week
we
sold
the
trucks
sang
as
the
train
ran
through
the
factory
district
furnaces
spurted
flame
and
were
clanging
red
lights
green
lights
furious
white
lights
rushed
past
and
babbitt
was
important
again
and
eager
iv
he
did
a
voluptuous
thing
he
had
his
clothes
pressed
on
the
train
in
the
morning
half
an
hour
before
they
reached
monarch
the
porter
came
to
his
berth
and
whispered
there
a
vacant
sir
i
put
your
suit
in
in
tan
autumn
overcoat
over
his
pajamas
babbitt
slipped
down
the
aisle
to
the
glory
of
his
first
private
compartment
the
porter
indicated
that
he
knew
babbitt
was
used
to
a
he
held
the
ends
of
babbitt
trousers
that
the
beautifully
sponged
garment
might
not
be
soiled
filled
the
bowl
in
the
private
washroom
and
waited
with
a
towel
to
have
a
private
washroom
was
luxurious
however
enlivening
a
pullman
was
by
night
even
to
babbitt
it
was
depressing
in
the
morning
when
it
was
jammed
with
fat
men
in
woolen
undershirts
every
hook
filled
with
wrinkled
cottony
shirts
the
leather
seat
piled
with
dingy
and
the
air
nauseating
with
the
smell
of
soap
and
toothpaste
babbitt
did
not
ordinarily
think
much
of
privacy
but
now
he
reveled
in
it
reveled
in
his
valet
and
purred
with
pleasure
as
he
gave
the
man
a
tip
of
a
dollar
and
a
half
he
rather
hoped
that
he
was
being
noticed
as
in
his
newly
pressed
clothes
with
the
adoring
porter
carrying
his
he
disembarked
at
monarch
he
was
to
share
a
room
at
the
hotel
sedgwick
with
rogers
that
shrewd
zenith
dealer
in
together
they
had
a
noble
breakfast
with
waffles
and
coffee
not
in
exiguous
cups
but
in
large
pots
babbitt
grew
expansive
and
told
rogers
about
the
art
of
writing
he
gave
a
bellboy
a
quarter
to
fetch
a
morning
newspaper
from
the
lobby
and
sent
to
tinka
a
papa
wishes
you
were
here
to
bat
round
with
v
the
meetings
of
the
convention
were
held
in
the
ballroom
of
the
allen
house
in
an
anteroom
was
the
office
of
the
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
he
was
the
busiest
man
in
the
convention
he
was
so
busy
that
he
got
nothing
done
whatever
he
sat
at
a
marquetry
table
in
a
room
littered
with
crumpled
paper
and
all
day
long
and
lobbyists
and
orators
who
wished
to
lead
debates
came
and
whispered
to
him
whereupon
he
looked
vague
and
said
rapidly
yes
yes
that
a
fine
idea
we
do
that
and
instantly
forgot
all
about
it
lighted
a
cigar
and
forgot
that
too
while
the
telephone
rang
mercilessly
and
about
him
men
kept
beseeching
say
chairman
say
chairman
without
penetrating
his
exhausted
hearing
in
the
were
plans
of
the
new
suburbs
of
sparta
pictures
of
the
new
state
capitol
at
galop
de
vache
and
large
ears
of
corn
with
the
label

gold
from
shelby
county
the
garden
spot
of
own
the
real
convention
consisted
of
men
muttering
in
hotel
bedrooms
or
in
groups
amid
the
crowd
in
the
but
there
was
a
show
of
public
meetings
the
first
of
them
opened
with
a
welcome
by
the
mayor
of
monarch
the
pastor
of
the
first
christian
church
of
monarch
a
large
man
with
a
long
damp
frontal
lock
informed
god
that
the
men
were
here
now
the
venerable
minnemagantic
realtor
major
carlton
tuke
read
a
paper
in
which
he
denounced
cooperative
stores
william
larkin
of
eureka
gave
a
comforting
prognosis
of
the
prospects
for
increased
construction
and
reminded
them
that
prices
were
two
points
lower
the
convention
was
on
the
delegates
were
entertained
incessantly
and
firmly
the
monarch
chamber
of
commerce
gave
them
a
banquet
and
the
association
an
afternoon
reception
at
which
a
chrysanthemum
was
presented
to
each
of
the
ladies
and
to
each
of
the
men
a
leather
inscribed
from
monarch
the
mighty
motor
crosby
knowlton
wife
of
the
manufacturer
of
fleetwing
automobiles
opened
her
celebrated
italian
garden
and
served
tea
six
hundred
men
and
wives
ambled
down
the
autumnal
paths
perhaps
three
hundred
of
them
were
quietly
inconspicuous
perhaps
three
hundred
vigorously
exclaimed
this
is
pretty
slick
eh
surreptitiously
picked
the
late
asters
and
concealed
them
in
their
pockets
and
tried
to
get
near
enough
to
knowlton
to
shake
her
lovely
hand
without
request
the
zenith
delegates
except
rountree
gathered
round
a
marble
dancing
nymph
and
sang
here
we
come
the
fellows
from
zenith
the
zip
it
chanced
that
all
the
delegates
from
pioneer
belonged
to
the
brotherly
and
protective
order
of
elks
and
they
produced
an
enormous
banner
lettered
b
best
people
on
earth
boost
pioneer
oh
nor
was
galop
de
vache
the
state
capital
to
be
slighted
the
leader
of
the
galop
de
vache
delegation
was
a
large
reddish
roundish
man
but
active
he
took
off
his
coat
hurled
his
broad
black
felt
hat
on
the
ground
rolled
up
his
sleeves
climbed
upon
the
sundial
spat
and
bellowed
we
tell
the
world
and
the
good
lady
who
giving
the
show
this
afternoon
that
the
bonniest
burg
in
this
man
state
is
galop
de
vache
you
boys
can
talk
about
your
zip
but
jus
lem
me
murmur
that
old
galop
has
the
largest
proportion
of
citizens
in
the
state
and
when
folks
own
their
homes
they
ai
starting
and
they
raising
kids
instead
of
raising
hell
galop
de
vache
the
town
for
homey
folks
the
town
that
eats
alive
oh
bosco
we
tell
the
world
the
guests
drove
off
the
garden
shivered
into
quiet
but
crosby
knowlton
sighed
as
she
looked
at
a
marble
seat
warm
from
five
hundred
summers
of
amalfi
on
the
face
of
a
winged
sphinx
which
supported
it
some
one
had
drawn
a
mustache
in
crumpled
paper
napkins
were
dumped
among
the
michaelmas
daisies
on
the
walk
like
shredded
lovely
flesh
were
the
petals
of
the
last
gallant
rose
cigarette
stubs
floated
in
the
goldfish
pool
trailing
an
evil
stain
as
they
swelled
and
disintegrated
and
beneath
the
marble
seat
the
fragments
carefully
put
together
was
a
smashed
teacup
vi
as
he
rode
back
to
the
hotel
babbitt
reflected
myra
would
have
enjoyed
all
this
social
for
himself
he
cared
less
for
the
garden
party
than
for
the
motor
tours
which
the
monarch
chamber
of
commerce
had
arranged
indefatigably
he
viewed
suburban
and
tanneries
he
devoured
the
statistics
which
were
given
to
him
and
marveled
to
his
roommate
rogers
of
course
this
town
is
a
patch
on
zenith
it
has
got
our
outlook
and
natural
resources
but
did
you
know
i
nev
did
till
that
they
manufactured
seven
hundred
and
million
feet
of
lumber
last
year
what
d
you
think
of
that
he
was
nervous
as
the
time
for
reading
his
paper
approached
when
he
stood
on
the
low
platform
before
the
convention
he
trembled
and
saw
only
a
purple
haze
but
he
was
in
earnest
and
when
he
had
finished
the
formal
paper
he
talked
to
them
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
spectacled
face
a
flashing
disk
like
a
plate
set
up
on
edge
in
the
lamplight
they
shouted
that
the
stuff
and
in
the
discussion
afterward
they
referred
with
impressiveness
to
our
friend
and
brother
george
he
had
in
fifteen
minutes
changed
from
a
minor
delegate
to
a
personage
almost
as
well
known
as
that
diplomat
of
business
cecil
rountree
after
the
meeting
delegates
from
all
over
the
state
said
hower
you
brother
babbitt
sixteen
complete
strangers
called
him
george
and
three
men
took
him
into
corners
to
confide
mighty
glad
you
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
give
the
profession
a
real
boost
now
i
always
maintained
next
morning
with
tremendous
casualness
babbitt
asked
the
girl
at
the
hotel
for
the
newspapers
from
zenith
there
was
nothing
in
the
press
but
in
the
on
the
third
page
he
gasped
they
had
printed
his
picture
and
a
account
the
heading
was
sensation
at
annual
convention
babbitt
prominent
ziptown
realtor
keynoter
in
fine
he
murmured
reverently
i
guess
some
of
the
folks
on
floral
heights
will
sit
up
and
take
notice
now
and
pay
a
little
attention
to
old
georgie
vii
it
was
the
last
meeting
the
delegations
were
presenting
the
claims
of
their
several
cities
to
the
next
year
convention
orators
were
announcing
that
galop
de
vache
the
capital
city
the
site
of
kremer
college
and
of
the
upholtz
knitting
works
is
the
recognized
center
of
culture
and
enterprise
and
that
hamburg
the
big
little
city
with
the
logical
location
where
every
man
is
and
every
woman
a
hostess
throws
wide
to
you
her
hospitable
in
the
midst
of
these
more
diffident
invitations
the
golden
doors
of
the
ballroom
opened
with
a
blatting
of
trumpets
and
a
circus
parade
rolled
in
it
was
composed
of
the
zenith
brokers
dressed
as
cowpunchers
bareback
riders
japanese
jugglers
at
the
head
was
big
warren
whitby
in
the
bearskin
and
coat
of
a
behind
him
as
a
clown
beating
a
bass
drum
extraordinarily
happy
and
noisy
was
babbitt
warren
whitby
leaped
on
the
platform
made
merry
play
with
his
baton
and
observed
boyses
and
girlses
the
time
has
came
to
get
down
to
cases
a
zenithite
sure
loves
his
neighbors
but
made
up
our
minds
to
grab
this
convention
off
our
neighbor
burgs
like
we
grabbed
the
business
and
the
business
and
harry
barmhill
the
convention
chairman
hinted
we
grateful
to
you
mr
uh
but
you
must
give
the
other
boys
a
chance
to
hand
in
their
bids
a
voice
blared
in
eureka
we
promise
free
motor
rides
through
the
prettiest
country
running
down
the
aisle
clapping
his
hands
a
lean
bald
young
man
cried
i
from
sparta
our
chamber
of
commerce
has
wired
me
they
set
aside
eight
thousand
dollars
in
real
money
for
the
entertainment
of
the
convention
a
man
rose
to
clamor
money
talks
move
we
accept
the
bid
from
sparta
it
was
accepted
viii
the
committee
on
resolutions
was
reporting
they
said
that
whereas
almighty
god
in
his
beneficent
mercy
had
seen
fit
to
remove
to
a
sphere
of
higher
usefulness
some
realtors
of
the
state
the
past
year
therefore
it
was
the
sentiment
of
this
convention
assembled
that
they
were
sorry
god
had
done
it
and
the
secretary
should
be
and
hereby
was
instructed
to
spread
these
resolutions
on
the
minutes
and
to
console
the
bereaved
families
by
sending
them
each
a
copy
a
second
resolution
authorized
the
president
of
the
to
spend
fifteen
thousand
dollars
in
lobbying
for
sane
tax
measures
in
the
state
legislature
this
resolution
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
menaces
to
sound
business
and
clearing
the
wheels
of
progress
from
and
shortsighted
obstacles
the
committee
on
committees
reported
and
with
startled
awe
babbitt
learned
that
he
had
been
appointed
a
member
of
the
committee
on
torrens
titles
he
rejoiced
i
said
it
was
going
to
be
a
great
year
georgie
old
son
you
got
big
things
ahead
of
you
you
a
orator
and
a
good
mixer
and
zowie
ix
there
was
no
formal
entertainment
provided
for
the
last
evening
babbitt
had
planned
to
go
home
but
that
afternoon
the
jered
sassburgers
of
pioneer
suggested
that
babbitt
and
rogers
have
tea
with
them
at
the
catalpa
inn
teas
were
not
unknown
to
babbitt
his
wife
and
he
earnestly
attended
them
at
least
twice
a
year
but
they
were
sufficiently
exotic
to
make
him
feel
important
he
sat
at
a
table
in
the
art
room
of
the
inn
with
its
painted
rabbits
mottoes
lettered
on
birch
bark
and
waitresses
being
artistic
in
dutch
caps
he
ate
insufficient
lettuce
sandwiches
and
was
lively
and
naughty
with
sassburger
who
was
as
smooth
and
as
a
sassburger
and
he
had
met
two
days
before
so
they
were
calling
each
other
georgie
and
sassburger
said
prayerfully
say
boys
before
you
go
seeing
this
is
the
last
chance
i
got
it
up
in
my
room
and
miriam
here
is
the
best
little
mixelogist
in
the
stati
unidos
like
us
italians
with
wide
flowing
gestures
babbitt
and
rogers
followed
the
sassburgers
to
their
room
sassburger
shrieked
oh
how
terrible
when
she
saw
that
she
had
left
a
chemise
of
sheer
lavender
crepe
on
the
bed
she
tucked
it
into
a
bag
while
babbitt
giggled
do
mind
us
we
a
couple
o
little
divvils
sassburger
telephoned
for
ice
and
the
who
brought
it
said
prosaically
and
unprompted
highball
glasses
or
cocktail
miriam
sassburger
mixed
the
cocktails
in
one
of
those
dismal
nakedly
white
which
exist
only
in
hotels
when
they
had
finished
the
first
round
she
proved
by
intoning
think
you
boys
could
stand
another
you
got
a
dividend
coming
that
though
she
was
but
a
woman
she
knew
the
complete
and
perfect
rite
of
outside
babbitt
hinted
to
rogers
say
old
rooster
it
comes
over
me
that
i
could
stand
it
if
we
did
go
back
to
the
lovin
wives
this
handsome
abend
but
just
kind
of
stayed
in
monarch
and
threw
a
party
heh

with
the
tongue
of
wisdom
and
sagashiteriferousness
el
wing
wife
has
gone
on
to
pittsburg
let
see
if
we
ca
gather
him
at
seven
they
sat
in
their
room
with
elbert
wing
and
two
delegates
their
coats
were
off
their
vests
open
their
faces
red
their
voices
emphatic
they
were
finishing
a
bottle
of
corrosive
bootlegged
whisky
and
imploring
the
say
son
can
you
get
us
some
more
of
this
embalming
fluid
they
were
smoking
large
cigars
and
dropping
ashes
and
stubs
on
the
carpet
with
windy
guffaws
they
were
telling
stories
they
were
in
fact
males
in
a
happy
state
of
nature
babbitt
sighed
i
do
know
how
it
strikes
you
hellions
but
personally
i
like
this
busting
loose
for
a
change
and
kicking
over
a
couple
of
mountains
and
climbing
up
on
the
north
pole
and
waving

aurora
borealis
the

a
grave
intense
youngster

have
gathered
in
two
other
comrades

manufacturer

and
a
dentist
they
all
drank
whisky
from
and
they
were

in
said
babbitt
but
they
put
off
departure
as
long
as
they
could
they
were
safe
while
they
sat
here
legs
firmly
crossed
under
the
table
but
they
felt
unsteady
they
were
afraid
of
navigating
the
long
and
slippery
floor
of
the
grillroom
under
the
eyes
of
the
other
guests
and
the
waiters
when
they
did
venture
tables
got
in
their
way
and
they
sought
to
cover
embarrassment
by
heavy
jocularity
at
the
coatroom
as
the
girl
handed
out
their
hats
they
smiled
at
her
and
hoped
that
she
a
cool
and
expert
judge
would
feel
that
they
were
gentlemen
they
croaked
at

tried
to

i
got
it
right
here
among
them
they
gave
her
three
dollars
xi
flamboyantly
smoking
cigars
they
sat
in
a
box
at
the
burlesque
show
their
feet
up
on
the
rail
while
a
chorus
of
twenty
daubed
worried
and
inextinguishably
respectable
grandams
swung
their
legs
in
the
more
elementary
and
a
jewish
comedian
made
vicious
fun
of
jews
in
the
they
met
other
lone
delegates
a
dozen
of
them
went
in
taxicabs
out
to
bright
blossom
inn
where
the
blossoms
were
made
of
dusty
paper
festooned
along
a
room
low
and
stinking
like
a
no
longer
wisely
used
here
whisky
was
served
openly
in
glasses
two
or
three
clerks
who
on
longed
to
be
taken
for
millionaires
sheepishly
danced
with
and
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
tables
fantastically
whirled
the
professionals
a
young
man
in
sleek
and
a
slim
mad
girl
in
emerald
silk
with
amber
hair
flung
up
as
jaggedly
as
flames
babbitt
tried
to
dance
with
her
he
shuffled
along
the
floor
too
bulky
to
be
guided
his
steps
unrelated
to
the
rhythm
of
the
jungle
music
and
in
his
staggering
he
would
have
fallen
had
she
not
held
him
with
supple
kindly
strength
he
was
blind
and
deaf
from
alcohol
he
could
not
see
the
tables
the
faces
but
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
girl
and
her
young
pliant
warmth
when
she
had
firmly
returned
him
to
his
group
he
remembered
by
a
connection
quite
untraceable
that
his
mother
mother
had
been
scotch
and
with
head
thrown
back
eyes
closed
wide
mouth
indicating
ecstasy
he
sang
very
slowly
and
richly
loch
but
that
was
the
last
of
his
mellowness
and
jolly
companionship
the
man
from
sparta
said
he
was
a
bum
singer
and
for
ten
minutes
babbitt
quarreled
with
him
in
a
loud
unsteady
heroic
indignation
they
called
for
drinks
till
the
manager
insisted
that
the
place
was
closed
all
the
while
babbitt
felt
a
hot
raw
desire
for
more
brutal
amusements
when
rogers
drawled
what
say
we
go
down
the
line
and
look
over
the
girls
he
agreed
savagely
before
they
went
three
of
them
secretly
made
appointments
with
the
professional
dancing
girl
who
agreed
yes
yes
sure
darling
to
everything
they
said
and
amiably
forgot
them
as
they
drove
back
through
the
outskirts
of
monarch
down
streets
of
small
brown
wooden
cottages
of
workmen
characterless
as
cells
as
they
rattled
across
which
by
drunken
night
seemed
vast
and
perilous
as
they
were
borne
toward
the
red
lights
and
violent
automatic
pianos
and
the
stocky
women
who
simpered
babbitt
was
frightened
he
wanted
to
leap
from
the
taxicab
but
all
his
body
was
a
murky
fire
and
he
groaned
too
late
to
quit
now
and
knew
that
he
did
not
want
to
quit
there
was
they
felt
one
very
humorous
incident
on
the
way
a
broker
from
minnemagantic
said
monarch
is
a
lot
sportier
than
zenith
you
zenith
tightwads
have
got
any
joints
like
these
babbitt
raged
that
a
dirty
lie
snothin
you
ca
find
in
zenith
believe
me
we
got
more
houses
and
an
all
kinds
o
dives
than
any
burg
in
the
he
realized
they
were
laughing
at
him
he
desired
to
fight
and
forgot
it
in
such
musty
unsatisfying
experiments
as
he
had
not
known
since
college
in
the
morning
when
he
returned
to
zenith
his
desire
for
rebellion
was
partly
satisfied
he
had
retrograded
to
a
shamefaced
contentment
he
was
irritable
he
did
not
smile
when
rogers
complained
ow
what
a
head
i
certainly
do
feel
like
the
wrath
of
god
this
morning
say
i
know
what
was
the
trouble
somebody
went
and
put
alcohol
in
my
booze
last
babbitt
excursion
was
never
known
to
his
family
nor
to
any
one
in
zenith
save
rogers
and
wing
it
was
not
officially
recognized
even
by
himself
if
it
had
any
consequences
they
have
not
been
discovered

his
district
was
safe
and
he
longed
for
stouter
battling
his
convention
paper
had
given
him
the
beginning
of
a
reputation
for
oratory
so
the
central
committee
sent
him
to
the
seventh
ward
and
south
zenith
to
address
small
audiences
of
workmen
and
clerks
and
wives
uneasy
with
their
new
votes
he
acquired
a
fame
enduring
for
weeks
now
and
then
a
reporter
was
present
at
one
of
his
meetings
and
the
headlines
though
they
were
not
very
large
indicated
that
george
babbitt
had
addressed
cheering
throng
and
distinguished
man
of
affairs
had
pointed
out
the
fallacies
of
doane
once
in
the
rotogravure
section
of
the
sunday
there
was
a
photograph
of
babbitt
and
a
dozen
other
business
men
with
the
caption
leaders
of
zenith
finance
and
commerce
who
back
he
deserved
his
glory
he
was
an
excellent
campaigner
he
had
faith
he
was
certain
that
if
lincoln
were
alive
he
would
be
electioneering
for
harding
unless
he
came
to
zenith
and
electioneered
for
lucas
prout
he
did
not
confuse
audiences
by
silly
subtleties
prout
represented
honest
industry
seneca
doane
represented
whining
laziness
and
you
could
take
your
choice
with
his
broad
shoulders
and
vigorous
voice
he
was
obviously
a
good
fellow
and
rarest
of
all
he
really
liked
people
he
almost
liked
common
workmen
he
wanted
them
to
be
well
paid
and
able
to
afford
high
rents
though
naturally
they
must
not
interfere
with
the
reasonable
profits
of
stockholders
thus
nobly
endowed
and
keyed
high
by
the
discovery
that
he
was
a
natural
orator
he
was
popular
with
audiences
and
he
raged
through
the
campaign
renowned
not
only
in
the
seventh
and
eighth
wards
but
even
in
parts
of
the
sixteenth
ii
crowded
in
his
car
they
came
driving
up
to
turnverein
hall
south
zenith
babbitt
his
wife
verona
ted
and
paul
and
zilla
riesling
the
hall
was
over
a
delicatessen
shop
in
a
street
banging
with
trolleys
and
smelling
of
onions
and
gasoline
and
fried
fish
a
new
appreciation
of
babbitt
filled
all
of
them
including
babbitt
do
know
how
you
keep
it
up
talking
to
three
bunches
in
one
evening
wish
i
had
your
strength
said
paul
and
ted
exclaimed
to
verona
the
old
man
certainly
does
know
how
to
kid
these
roughnecks
along
men
in
black
sateen
shirts
their
faces
but
with
a
hint
of
grime
under
their
eyes
were
loitering
on
the
broad
stairs
up
to
the
hall
babbitt
party
politely
edged
through
them
and
into
the
whitewashed
room
at
the
front
of
which
was
a
dais
with
a
throne
and
a
pine
altar
painted
watery
blue
as
used
nightly
by
the
grand
masters
and
supreme
potentates
of
innumerable
lodges
the
hall
was
full
as
babbitt
pushed
through
the
fringe
standing
at
the
back
he
heard
the
precious
tribute
that
him
the
chairman
bustled
down
the
center
aisle
with
an
impressive
the
speaker
all
ready
sir
uh
see
what
was
the
name
sir
then
babbitt
slid
into
a
sea
of
eloquence
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
sixteenth
ward
there
is
one
who
can
not
be
with
us
here
a
man
than
whom
there
is
no
more
stalwart
trojan
in
all
the
political
arena
i
refer
to
our
leader
the
honorable
lucas
prout
of
the
city
and
county
of
zenith
since
he
is
not
here
i
trust
that
you
will
bear
with
me
if
as
a
friend
and
neighbor
as
one
who
is
proud
to
share
with
you
the
common
blessing
of
being
a
resident
of
the
great
city
of
zenith
i
tell
you
in
all
candor
honesty
and
sincerity
how
the
issues
of
this
critical
campaign
appear
to
one
plain
man
of
business
to
one
who
brought
up
to
the
blessings
of
poverty
and
of
manual
labor
has
even
when
fate
condemned
him
to
sit
at
a
desk
yet
never
forgotten
how
it
feels
by
heck
to
be
up
at
and
at
the
factory
with
the
ole
in
his
hardened
mitt
when
the
whistle
blew
at
seven
unless
the
owner
sneaked
in
ten
minutes
on
us
and
blew
it
early
laughter
to
come
down
to
the
basic
and
fundamental
issues
of
this
campaign
the
great
error
insincerely
promulgated
by
seneca
doane
there
were
workmen
who
jeered
young
cynical
workmen
for
the
most
part
foreigners
jews
swedes
irishmen
italians
but
the
older
men
the
patient
bleached
stooped
carpenters
and
mechanics
cheered
him
and
when
he
worked
up
to
his
anecdote
of
lincoln
their
eyes
were
wet
modestly
busily
he
hurried
out
of
the
hall
on
delicious
applause
and
sped
off
to
his
third
audience
of
the
evening
ted
you
better
drive
he
said
kind
of
all
in
after
that
spiel
well
paul
how
it
go
did
i
get
bully
corking
you
had
a
lot
of
babbitt
worshiped
oh
it
was
fine
so
clear
and
interesting
and
such
nice
ideas
when
i
hear
you
orating
i
realize
i
do
appreciate
how
profoundly
you
think
and
what
a
splendid
brain
and
vocabulary
you
have
just
but
verona
was
irritating
dad
she
worried
how
do
you
know
that
public
ownership
of
utilities
and
so
on
and
so
forth
will
always
be
a
failure
babbitt
reproved
rone
i
should
think
you
could
see
and
realize
that
when
your
father
all
worn
out
with
orating
it
no
time
to
expect
him
to
explain
these
complicated
subjects
i
sure
when
rested
he
be
glad
to
explain
it
to
you
now
let
all
be
quiet
and
give
papa
a
chance
to
get
ready
for
his
next
speech
just
think
right
now
they
gathering
in
maccabee
temple
and
waiting
for
us
iii
lucas
prout
and
sound
business
defeated
seneca
doane
and
class
rule
and
zenith
was
again
saved
babbitt
was
offered
several
minor
appointments
to
distribute
among
poor
relations
but
he
preferred
advance
information
about
the
extension
of
paved
highways
and
this
a
grateful
administration
gave
to
him
also
he
was
one
of
only
nineteen
speakers
at
the
dinner
with
which
the
chamber
of
commerce
celebrated
the
victory
of
righteousness
his
reputation
for
oratory
established
at
the
dinner
of
the
zenith
real
estate
board
he
made
the
annual
address
the
reported
this
speech
with
unusual
fullness
one
of
the
livest
banquets
that
has
recently
been
pulled
off
occurred
last
night
in
the
annual
fest
of
the
zenith
real
estate
board
held
in
the
venetian
ball
room
of
the
house
mine
host
gil
had
as
usual
done
himself
proud
and
those
assembled
feasted
on
such
an
assemblage
of
plates
as
could
be
rivaled
nowhere
west
of
new
york
if
there
and
washed
down
the
plenteous
feed
with
the
cup
which
inspired
but
did
not
inebriate
in
the
shape
of
cider
from
the
farm
of
chandler
mott
president
of
the
board
and
who
acted
as
witty
and
efficient
chairman
as
mott
was
suffering
from
slight
infection
and
sore
throat
babbitt
made
the
principal
talk
besides
outlining
the
progress
of
torrensing
real
estate
titles
babbitt
spoke
in
part
as
follows
rising
to
address
you
with
my
impromptu
speech
carefully
tucked
into
my
vest
pocket
i
am
reminded
of
the
story
of
the
two
irishmen
mike
and
pat
who
were
riding
on
the
pullman
both
of
them
i
forgot
to
say
were
sailors
in
the
navy
it
seems
mike
had
the
lower
berth
and
by
and
by
he
heard
a
terrible
racket
from
the
upper
and
when
he
yelled
up
to
find
out
what
the
trouble
was
pat
answered
shure
an
bedad
an
how
can
i
ever
get
a
night
sleep
at
all
at
all
i
been
trying
to
get
into
this
darned
little
hammock
ever
since
eight
bells
gentlemen
standing
up
here
before
you
i
feel
a
good
deal
like
pat
and
maybe
after
i
spieled
along
for
a
while
i
may
feel
so
darn
small
that
i
be
able
to
crawl
into
a
pullman
hammock
with
no
trouble
at
all
at
all
it
strikes
me
that
each
year
at
this
annual
occasion
when
friend
and
foe
get
together
and
lay
down
the
and
let
the
waves
of
waft
them
up
the
flowery
slopes
of
amity
it
behooves
us
standing
together
eye
to
eye
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
of
the
best
city
in
the
world
to
consider
where
we
are
both
as
regards
ourselves
and
the
common
weal
is
true
that
even
with
our
or
practically
population
there
are
by
the
last
census
almost
a
score
of
larger
cities
in
the
united
states
but
gentlemen
if
by
the
next
census
we
do
not
stand
at
least
tenth
then
i
be
the
first
to
request
any
knocker
to
remove
my
shirt
and
to
eat
the
same
with
the
compliments
of
babbitt
esquire
it
may
be
true
that
new
york
chicago
and
philadelphia
will
continue
to
keep
ahead
of
us
in
size
but
aside
from
these
three
cities
which
are
notoriously
so
overgrown
that
no
decent
white
man
nobody
who
loves
his
wife
and
kiddies
and
god
good
and
likes
to
shake
the
hand
of
his
neighbor
in
greeting
would
want
to
live
in
them
and
let
me
tell
you
right
here
and
now
i
would
trade
a
zenith
acreage
development
for
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
broadway
or
state
street
aside
from
these
three
it
evident
to
any
one
with
a
head
for
facts
that
zenith
is
the
finest
example
of
american
life
and
prosperity
to
be
found
anywhere
do
mean
to
say
we
perfect
we
got
a
lot
to
do
in
the
way
of
extending
the
paving
of
motor
boulevards
for
believe
me
it
the
fellow
with
four
to
ten
thousand
a
year
say
and
an
automobile
and
a
nice
little
family
in
a
bungalow
on
the
edge
of
town
that
makes
the
wheels
of
progress
go
round
the
type
of
fellow
that
ruling
america
in
fact
the
ideal
type
to
which
the
entire
world
must
tend
if
there
to
be
a
decent
christian
future
for
this
little
old
planet
once
in
a
while
i
just
naturally
sit
back
and
size
up
this
solid
american
citizen
with
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
satisfaction
ideal
citizen
i
picture
him
first
and
foremost
as
being
busier
than
a
not
wasting
a
lot
of
good
time
in
or
going
to
sassiety
teas
or
kicking
about
things
that
are
none
of
his
business
but
putting
the
zip
into
some
store
or
profession
or
art
at
night
he
lights
up
a
good
cigar
and
climbs
into
the
little
old
and
maybe
cusses
the
carburetor
and
shoots
out
home
he
mows
the
lawn
or
sneaks
in
some
practice
putting
and
then
he
ready
for
dinner
after
dinner
he
tells
the
kiddies
a
story
or
takes
the
family
to
the
movies
or
plays
a
few
fists
of
bridge
or
reads
the
evening
paper
and
a
chapter
or
two
of
some
good
lively
western
novel
if
he
has
a
taste
for
literature
and
maybe
the
folks
drop
in
and
they
sit
and
visit
about
their
friends
and
the
topics
of
the
day
then
he
goes
happily
to
bed
his
conscience
clear
having
contributed
his
mite
to
the
prosperity
of
the
city
and
to
his
own
politics
and
religion
this
sane
citizen
is
the
canniest
man
on
earth
and
in
the
arts
he
invariably
has
a
natural
taste
which
makes
him
pick
out
the
best
every
time
in
no
country
in
the
world
will
you
find
so
many
reproductions
of
the
old
masters
and
of
paintings
on
parlor
walls
as
in
these
united
states
no
country
has
anything
like
our
number
of
phonographs
with
not
only
dance
records
and
comic
but
also
the
best
operas
such
as
verdi
rendered
by
the
world
singers
other
countries
art
and
literature
are
left
to
a
lot
of
shabby
bums
living
in
attics
and
feeding
on
booze
and
spaghetti
but
in
america
the
successful
writer
or
is
indistinguishable
from
any
other
decent
business
man
and
i
for
one
am
only
too
glad
that
the
man
who
has
the
rare
skill
to
season
his
message
with
interesting
reading
matter
and
who
shows
both
purpose
and
pep
in
handling
his
literary
wares
has
a
chance
to
drag
down
his
fifty
thousand
bucks
a
year
to
mingle
with
the
biggest
executives
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
and
to
show
as
big
a
house
and
as
swell
a
car
as
any
captain
of
industry
but
mind
you
it
the
appreciation
of
the
regular
guy
who
i
have
been
depicting
which
has
made
this
possible
and
you
got
to
hand
as
much
credit
to
him
as
to
the
authors
themselves
but
most
important
our
standardized
citizen
even
if
he
is
a
bachelor
is
a
lover
of
the
little
ones
a
supporter
of
the
hearthstone
which
is
the
basic
foundation
of
our
civilization
first
last
and
all
the
time
and
the
thing
that
most
distinguishes
us
from
the
decayed
nations
of
europe
have
never
yet
toured
europe
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
such
an
awful
lot
as
long
as
there
our
own
mighty
cities
and
mountains
to
be
seen
but
the
way
i
figure
it
out
there
must
be
a
good
many
of
our
own
sort
of
folks
abroad
indeed
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
rotarians
i
ever
met
boosted
the
tenets
of
pep
in
a
burr
that
smacked
o
bonny
scutlond
and
all
ye
bonny
braes
o
bobby
burns
but
same
time
one
thing
that
distinguishes
us
from
our
good
brothers
the
hustlers
over
there
is
that
they
willing
to
take
a
lot
off
the
snobs
and
journalists
and
politicians
while
the
modern
american
business
man
knows
how
to
talk
right
up
for
himself
knows
how
to
make
it
good
and
plenty
clear
that
he
intends
to
run
the
works
he
does
have
to
call
in
some
highbrow
when
it
necessary
for
him
to
answer
the
crooked
critics
of
the
sane
and
efficient
life
he
not
dumb
like
the
merchant
he
got
a
vocabulary
and
a
punch
all
modesty
i
want
to
stand
up
here
as
a
representative
business
man
and
gently
whisper
here
our
kind
of
folks
here
the
specifications
of
the
standardized
american
citizen
here
the
new
generation
of
americans
fellows
with
hair
on
their
chests
and
smiles
in
their
eyes
and
in
their
offices
we
not
doing
any
boasting
but
we
like
ourselves
and
if
you
do
like
us
look
out
better
get
under
cover
before
the
cyclone
hits
town
in
my
clumsy
way
i
have
tried
to
sketch
the
real
the
fellow
with
zip
and
bang
and
it
because
zenith
has
so
large
a
proportion
of
such
men
that
it
the
most
stable
the
greatest
of
our
cities
new
york
also
has
its
thousands
of
real
folks
but
new
york
is
cursed
with
unnumbered
foreigners
so
are
chicago
and
san
francisco
oh
we
have
a
golden
roster
of
cities
detroit
and
cleveland
with
their
renowned
factories
cincinnati
with
its
great
and
soap
products
pittsburg
and
birmingham
with
their
steel
kansas
city
and
minneapolis
and
omaha
that
open
their
bountiful
gates
on
the
bosom
of
the
wheatlands
and
countless
other
magnificent
for
by
the
last
census
there
were
no
less
than
glorious
american
burgs
with
a
population
of
over
one
hundred
thousand
and
all
these
cities
stand
together
for
power
and
purity
and
against
foreign
ideas
and
communism
atlanta
with
hartford
rochester
with
denver
milwaukee
with
indianapolis
los
angeles
with
scranton
portland
maine
with
portland
oregon
a
good
live
wire
from
baltimore
or
seattle
or
duluth
is
the
of
every
like
fellow
booster
from
buffalo
or
akron
fort
worth
or
oskaloosa
it
here
in
zenith
the
home
for
manly
men
and
womanly
women
and
bright
kids
that
you
find
the
largest
proportion
of
these
regular
guys
and
that
what
sets
it
in
a
class
by
itself
that
why
zenith
will
be
remembered
in
history
as
having
set
the
pace
for
a
civilization
that
shall
endure
when
the
old
ways
are
gone
forever
and
the
day
of
earnest
efficient
endeavor
shall
have
dawned
all
round
the
world
time
i
hope
folks
will
quit
handing
all
the
credit
to
a
lot
of
mildewed
old
european
dumps
and
give
proper
credit
to
the
famous
zenith
spirit
that
clean
fighting
determination
to
win
success
that
has
made
the
little
old
zip
city
celebrated
in
every
land
and
clime
wherever
condensed
milk
and
pasteboard
cartons
are
known
believe
me
the
world
has
fallen
too
long
for
these
countries
that
are
producing
anything
but
bootblacks
and
scenery
and
booze
that
have
got
one
bathroom
per
hundred
people
and
that
know
a
ledger
from
a
and
it
just
about
time
for
some
zenithite
to
get
his
back
up
and
holler
for
a
tell
you
zenith
and
her
are
producing
a
new
type
of
civilization
there
are
many
resemblances
between
zenith
and
these
other
burgs
and
i
darn
glad
of
it
the
extraordinary
growing
and
sane
standardization
of
stores
offices
streets
hotels
clothes
and
newspapers
throughout
the
united
states
shows
how
strong
and
enduring
a
type
is
ours
always
like
to
remember
a
piece
that
chum
frink
wrote
for
the
newspapers
about
his
it
is
doubtless
familiar
to
many
of
you
but
if
you
will
permit
me
i
take
a
chance
and
read
it
one
of
the
classic
poems
like
if
by
kipling
or
ella
wheeler
the
man
worth
while
and
i
always
carry
this
clipping
of
it
in
my
when
i
am
out
upon
the
road
a
poet
with
a
pedler
load
i
mostly
sing
a
hearty
song
and
take
a
chew
and
hike
along
out
my
samples
fine
of
cheero
brand
of
sweet
sunshine
and
peddling
optimistic
pokes
and
stable
lines
of
japes
and
jokes
to
lyceums
and
other
folks
to
rotarys
kiwanis
clubs
and
feel
i
ai
like
other
dubs
and
then
old
major
silas
satan
a
brainy
cuss
who
always
waitin
he
gives
his
tail
a
lively
quirk
and
gets
in
quick
his
dirty
work
he
fills
me
up
with
mullygrubs
my
hair
the
backward
way
he
rubs
he
makes
me
lonelier
than
a
hound
on
sunday
when
the
folks
ai
round
and
then
b
gosh
i
would
prefer
to
never
be
a
lecturer
round
in
classy
cars
and
smoking
cigars
and
never
more
i
want
to
roam
i
simply
want
to
be
back
home
flap
jacks
hash
and
ham
with
folks
who
savvy
whom
i
am
but
when
i
get
that
lonely
spell
i
simply
seek
the
best
hotel
no
matter
in
what
town
i
be
paul
toledo
or
in
washington
schenectady
in
louisville
or
albany
and
at
that
inn
it
hits
my
dome
that
i
again
am
right
at
home
if
i
should
stand
a
lengthy
spell
in
front
of
that
hotel
that
to
the
drummers
loves
to
cater
across
from
some
big
film
theayter
if
i
should
look
around
and
buzz
and
wonder
in
what
town
i
was
i
swear
that
i
could
never
tell
for
all
the
crowd
would
be
so
swell
in
just
the
same
fine
sort
of
jeans
they
wear
at
home
and
all
the
queens
with
spiffy
bonnets
on
their
beans
and
all
the
fellows
standing
round
always
i
be
bound
the
same
good
jolly
kind
of
guff
autos
politics
and
stuff
and
baseball
players
of
renown
that
nice
guys
talk
in
my
home
town
then
when
i
entered
that
hotel
i
look
around
and
say
well
well
for
there
would
be
the
same
same
magazines
and
candies
grand
same
smokes
of
famous
standard
brand
i
find
at
home
tell
and
when
i
saw
the
jolly
bunch
come
waltzing
in
for
eats
at
lunch
and
squaring
up
in
natty
duds
to
platters
large
of
french
fried
spuds
why
then
i
stand
right
up
and
bawl
i
never
left
my
home
at
all
and
all
replete
i
sit
me
down
beside
some
guy
in
derby
brown
upon
a
lobby
chair
of
plush
and
murmur
to
him
in
a
rush
hello
bill
tell
me
good
old
scout
how
is
your
stock
out
then
we
be
off
two
solid
pals
like
giddy
gals
of
flivvers
weather
home
and
wives
then
for
all
our
lives
so
when
sam
satan
makes
you
blue
good
friend
that
what
i
up
and
do
for
in
these
states
you
roam
you
never
leave
your
home
sweet
sir
these
other
burgs
are
our
true
partners
in
the
great
game
of
vital
living
but
let
not
have
any
mistake
about
this
i
claim
that
zenith
is
the
best
partner
and
the
partner
of
the
whole
caboodle
i
trust
i
may
be
pardoned
if
i
give
a
few
statistics
to
back
up
my
claims
if
they
are
old
stuff
to
any
of
you
yet
the
tidings
of
prosperity
like
the
good
news
of
the
bible
never
become
tedious
to
the
ears
of
a
real
hustler
no
matter
how
oft
the
sweet
story
is
told
every
intelligent
person
knows
that
zenith
manufactures
more
condensed
milk
and
evaporated
cream
more
paper
boxes
and
more
than
any
other
city
in
the
united
states
if
not
in
the
world
but
it
is
not
so
universally
known
that
we
also
stand
second
in
the
manufacture
of
sixth
in
the
giant
realm
of
motors
and
automobiles
and
somewhere
about
third
in
cheese
leather
findings
tar
roofing
breakfast
food
and
overalls
greatness
however
lies
not
alone
in
punchful
prosperity
but
equally
in
that
public
spirit
that
idealism
and
brotherhood
which
has
marked
zenith
ever
since
its
foundation
by
the
fathers
we
have
a
right
indeed
we
have
a
duty
toward
our
fair
city
to
announce
broadcast
the
facts
about
our
high
schools
characterized
by
their
complete
plants
and
the
finest
systems
in
the
country
bar
none
our
magnificent
new
hotels
and
banks
and
the
paintings
and
carved
marble
in
their
lobbies
and
the
second
national
tower
the
second
highest
business
building
in
any
inland
city
in
the
entire
country
when
i
add
that
we
have
an
unparalleled
number
of
miles
of
paved
streets
bathrooms
vacuum
cleaners
and
all
the
other
signs
of
civilization
that
our
library
and
art
museum
are
well
supported
and
housed
in
convenient
and
roomy
buildings
that
our
is
more
than
up
to
par
with
its
handsome
driveways
adorned
with
grass
shrubs
and
statuary
then
i
give
but
a
hint
of
the
all
round
unlimited
greatness
of
zenith
believe
however
in
keeping
the
best
to
the
last
when
i
remind
you
that
we
have
one
motor
car
for
every
five
and
persons
in
the
city
then
i
give
a
practical
indication
of
the
kind
of
progress
and
braininess
which
is
synonymous
with
the
name
zenith
the
way
of
the
righteous
is
not
all
roses
before
i
close
i
must
call
your
attention
to
a
problem
we
have
to
face
this
coming
year
the
worst
menace
to
sound
government
is
not
the
avowed
socialists
but
a
lot
of
cowards
who
work
under
cover
the
gentry
who
call
themselves
liberals
and
radicals
and
and
intelligentsia
and
god
only
knows
how
many
other
trick
names
irresponsible
teachers
and
professors
constitute
the
worst
of
this
whole
gang
and
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
several
of
them
are
on
the
faculty
of
our
great
state
university
the
is
my
own
alma
mater
and
i
am
proud
to
be
known
as
an
alumni
but
there
are
certain
instructors
there
who
seem
to
think
we
ought
to
turn
the
conduct
of
the
nation
over
to
hoboes
and
roustabouts
profs
are
the
snakes
to
be
scotched
they
and
all
their
ilk
the
american
business
man
is
generous
to
a
fault
but
one
thing
he
does
demand
of
all
teachers
and
lecturers
and
journalists
if
we
going
to
pay
them
our
good
money
they
got
to
help
us
by
selling
efficiency
and
whooping
it
up
for
rational
prosperity
and
when
it
comes
to
these
pessimistic
cynical
university
teachers
let
me
tell
you
that
during
this
golden
coming
year
it
just
as
much
our
duty
to
bring
influence
to
have
those
cusses
fired
as
it
is
to
sell
all
the
real
estate
and
gather
in
all
the
good
shekels
we
can
till
that
is
done
will
our
sons
and
daughters
see
that
the
ideal
of
american
manhood
and
culture
is
a
lot
of
cranks
sitting
around
chewing
the
rag
about
their
rights
and
their
wrongs
but
a
hustling
successful
regular
guy
who
belongs
to
some
church
with
pep
and
piety
to
it
who
belongs
to
the
boosters
or
the
rotarians
or
the
kiwanis
to
the
elks
or
moose
or
red
men
or
knights
of
columbus
or
any
one
of
a
score
of
organizations
of
good
jolly
kidding
laughing
sweating
upstanding
royal
good
fellows
who
plays
hard
and
works
hard
and
whose
answer
to
his
critics
is
a
boot
that
teach
the
grouches
and
smart
alecks
to
respect
the
and
get
out
and
root
for
uncle
samuel
iv
babbitt
promised
to
become
a
recognized
orator
he
entertained
a
smoker
of
the
men
club
of
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
church
with
irish
jewish
and
chinese
dialect
stories
but
in
nothing
was
he
more
clearly
revealed
as
the
prominent
citizen
than
in
his
lecture
on
brass
tacks
facts
on
real
estate
as
delivered
before
the
class
in
sales
methods
at
the
zenith
the
reported
the
lecture
so
fully
that
vergil
gunch
said
to
babbitt
you
getting
to
be
one
of
the
classiest
spellbinders
in
town
seems
if
i
could
pick
up
a
paper
without
reading
about
your
eloquence
all
this
guff
ought
to
bring
a
lot
of
business
into
your
office
good
work
keep
it
up
go
on
quit
your
kidding
said
babbitt
feebly
but
at
this
tribute
from
gunch
himself
a
man
of
no
mean
oratorical
fame
he
expanded
with
delight
and
wondered
how
before
his
vacation
he
could
have
questioned
the
joys
of
being
a
solid
citizen
chapter
xv
his
march
to
greatness
was
not
without
disastrous
stumbling
fame
did
not
bring
the
social
advancement
which
the
babbitts
deserved
they
were
not
asked
to
join
the
tonawanda
country
club
nor
invited
to
the
dances
at
the
union
himself
babbitt
fretted
he
did
care
a
fat
hoot
for
all
these
highrollers
but
the
wife
would
kind
of
like
to
be
among
those
he
nervously
awaited
his
university
and
an
evening
of
furious
intimacy
with
such
social
leaders
as
charles
mckelvey
the
millionaire
contractor
max
kruger
the
banker
irving
tate
the
and
adelbert
dobson
the
fashionable
interior
decorator
theoretically
he
was
their
friend
as
he
had
been
in
college
and
when
he
encountered
them
they
still
called
him
georgie
but
he
did
seem
to
encounter
them
often
and
they
never
invited
him
to
dinner
with
champagne
and
a
butler
at
their
houses
on
royal
ridge
all
the
week
before
the
he
thought
of
them
no
reason
why
we
should
become
real
chummy
now
ii
like
all
true
american
diversions
and
spiritual
outpourings
the
dinner
of
the
men
of
the
class
of
was
thoroughly
organized
the
hammered
like
a
once
a
week
they
sent
out
reminders
tickler
no
old
man
are
you
going
to
be
with
us
at
the
livest
friendship
feed
the
alumni
of
the
good
old
u
have
ever
known
the
alumnae
of
turned
out
strong
are
we
boys
going
to
be
beaten
by
a
bunch
of
skirts
come
on
fellows
let
work
up
some
real
genuine
enthusiasm
and
all
boost
together
for
the
snappiest
dinner
yet
elegant
eats
short
and
memories
shared
together
of
the
brightest
gladdest
days
of
life
the
dinner
was
held
in
a
private
room
at
the
union
club
the
club
was
a
dingy
building
three
pretentious
old
dwellings
knocked
together
and
the
resembled
a
potato
cellar
yet
the
babbitt
who
was
free
of
the
magnificence
of
the
athletic
club
entered
with
embarrassment
he
nodded
to
the
doorman
an
ancient
proud
negro
with
brass
buttons
and
a
blue
and
paraded
through
the
hall
trying
to
look
like
a
member
sixty
men
had
come
to
the
dinner
they
made
islands
and
eddies
in
the
hall
they
packed
the
elevator
and
the
corners
of
the
private
they
tried
to
be
intimate
and
enthusiastic
they
appeared
to
one
another
exactly
as
they
had
in
college
as
raw
youngsters
whose
present
mustaches
baldnesses
paunches
and
wrinkles
were
but
jovial
disguises
put
on
for
the
evening
you
have
changed
a
particle
they
marveled
the
men
whom
they
could
not
recall
they
addressed
well
well
great
to
see
you
again
old
man
what
are
you
still
doing
the
same
thing
some
one
was
always
starting
a
cheer
or
a
college
song
and
it
was
always
thinning
into
silence
despite
their
resolution
to
be
democratic
they
divided
into
two
sets
the
men
with
and
the
men
without
babbitt
extremely
in
went
from
one
group
to
the
other
though
he
was
almost
frankly
out
for
social
conquest
he
sought
paul
riesling
first
he
found
him
alone
neat
and
silent
paul
sighed
i
no
good
at
this
handshaking
and
look
here
rats
now
paulibus
loosen
up
and
be
a
mixer
finest
bunch
of
boys
on
earth
say
you
seem
kind
of
glum
what
matter
oh
the
usual
with
come
on
let
wade
in
and
forget
our
he
kept
paul
beside
him
but
worked
toward
the
spot
where
charles
mckelvey
stood
warming
his
admirers
like
a
furnace
mckelvey
had
been
the
hero
of
the
class
of
not
only
football
captain
and
but
debater
and
passable
in
what
the
state
university
considered
scholarship
he
had
gone
on
had
captured
the
once
owned
by
the
dodsworths
pioneer
family
of
zenith
he
built
state
capitols
skyscrapers
railway
terminals
he
was
a
man
but
not
sluggish
there
was
a
quiet
humor
in
his
eyes
a
quickness
in
his
speech
which
intimidated
politicians
and
warned
reporters
and
in
his
presence
the
most
intelligent
scientist
or
the
most
sensitive
artist
felt
unworldly
and
a
little
shabby
he
was
particularly
when
he
was
influencing
legislatures
or
hiring
very
easy
and
lovable
and
gorgeous
he
was
baronial
he
was
a
peer
in
the
rapidly
crystallizing
american
aristocracy
inferior
only
to
the
haughty
old
families
in
zenith
an
old
family
is
one
which
came
to
town
before
his
power
was
the
greater
because
he
was
not
hindered
by
scruples
by
either
the
vice
or
the
virtue
of
the
older
puritan
tradition
mckelvey
was
being
placidly
merry
now
with
the
great
the
manufacturers
and
bankers
the
and
lawyers
and
surgeons
who
had
chauffeurs
and
went
to
europe
babbitt
squeezed
among
them
he
liked
smile
as
much
as
the
social
advancement
to
be
had
from
his
favor
if
in
paul
company
he
felt
ponderous
and
protective
with
mckelvey
he
felt
slight
and
adoring
he
heard
mckelvey
say
to
max
kruger
the
banker
yes
we
put
up
sir
gerald
babbitt
democratic
love
for
titles
became
a
rich
relish
you
know
he
one
of
the
biggest
in
england
max
horribly
why
hello
old
georgie
say
max
george
babbitt
is
getting
fatter
than
i
am
the
chairman
shouted
take
your
seats
fellows
shall
we
make
a
move
charley
babbitt
said
casually
to
mckelvey
right
hello
paul
how
the
old
fiddler
planning
to
sit
anywhere
special
george
come
on
let
grab
some
seats
come
on
max
georgie
i
read
about
your
speeches
in
the
campaign
bully
work
after
that
babbitt
would
have
followed
him
through
fire
he
was
enormously
busy
during
the
dinner
now
bumblingly
cheering
paul
now
approaching
mckelvey
with
hear
you
going
to
build
some
piers
in
brooklyn
now
noting
how
enviously
the
failures
of
the
class
sitting
by
themselves
in
a
weedy
group
looked
up
to
him
in
his
association
with
the
nobility
now
warming
himself
in
the
society
talk
of
mckelvey
and
max
kruger
they
spoke
of
a
jungle
dance
for
which
mona
dodsworth
had
decorated
her
house
with
thousands
of
orchids
they
spoke
with
an
excellent
imitation
of
casualness
of
a
dinner
in
washington
at
which
mckelvey
had
met
a
senator
a
balkan
princess
and
an
english
mckelvey
called
the
princess
jenny
and
let
it
be
known
that
he
had
danced
with
her
babbitt
was
thrilled
but
not
so
weighted
with
awe
as
to
be
silent
if
he
was
not
invited
by
them
to
dinner
he
was
yet
accustomed
to
talking
with
congressmen
and
clubwomen
who
entertained
poets
he
was
bright
and
referential
with
mckelvey
say
charley
juh
remember
in
junior
year
how
we
chartered
a
hack
and
chased
down
to
riverdale
to
the
big
show
madame
brown
used
to
put
on
remember
how
you
beat
up
that
hick
constabule
that
tried
to
run
us
in
and
we
pinched
the
sign
and
took
and
hung
it
on
morrison
door
oh
gosh
those
were
the
days
those
mckelvey
agreed
were
the
days
babbitt
had
reached
it
is
the
books
you
study
in
college
but
the
friendships
you
make
that
counts
when
the
men
at
head
of
the
table
broke
into
song
he
attacked
mckelvey
it
a
shame
uh
shame
to
drift
apart
because
our
uh
business
activities
lie
in
different
fields
i
enjoyed
talking
over
the
good
old
days
you
and
mckelvey
must
come
to
dinner
some
vaguely
yes
indeed
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
growth
of
real
estate
out
beyond
your
grantsville
warehouse
i
might
be
able
to
tip
you
off
to
a
thing
or
two
splendid
we
must
have
dinner
together
georgie
just
let
me
know
and
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
have
your
wife
and
you
at
the
house
said
mckelvey
much
less
vaguely
then
the
chairman
voice
that
prodigious
voice
which
once
had
roused
them
to
cheer
defiance
at
rooters
from
ohio
or
michigan
or
indiana
whooped
come
on
you
wombats
all
together
in
the
long
yell
babbitt
felt
that
life
would
never
be
sweeter
than
now
when
he
joined
with
paul
riesling
and
the
newly
recovered
hero
mckelvey
in
get
an
ax
who
who
the
hooroo
iii
the
babbitts
invited
the
mckelveys
to
dinner
in
early
december
and
the
mckelveys
not
only
accepted
but
after
changing
the
date
once
or
twice
actually
came
the
babbitts
somewhat
thoroughly
discussed
the
details
of
the
dinner
from
the
purchase
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
the
number
of
salted
almonds
to
be
placed
before
each
person
especially
did
they
mention
the
matter
of
the
other
guests
to
the
last
babbitt
held
out
for
giving
paul
riesling
the
benefit
of
being
with
the
mckelveys
good
old
charley
would
like
paul
and
verg
gunch
better
than
some
highfalutin
willy
boy
he
insisted
but
babbitt
interrupted
his
observations
with
yes
perhaps
i
think
i
try
to
get
some
lynnhaven
oysters
and
when
she
was
quite
ready
she
invited
angus
the
oculist
and
a
dismally
respectable
lawyer
named
maxwell
with
their
glittering
wives
neither
angus
nor
maxwell
belonged
to
the
elks
or
to
the
athletic
club
neither
of
them
had
ever
called
babbitt
brother
or
asked
his
opinions
on
carburetors
the
only
human
people
whom
she
invited
babbitt
raged
were
the
littlefields
and
howard
littlefield
at
times
became
so
statistical
that
babbitt
longed
for
the
refreshment
of
gunch
well
old
what
the
good
word
immediately
after
lunch
babbitt
began
to
set
the
table
for
the
dinner
to
the
mckelveys
and
babbitt
was
by
order
home
at
four
but
they
did
find
anything
for
him
to
do
and
three
times
babbitt
scolded
do
please
try
to
keep
out
of
the
way
he
stood
in
the
door
of
the
garage
his
lips
drooping
and
wished
that
littlefield
or
sam
doppelbrau
or
somebody
would
come
along
and
talk
to
him
he
saw
ted
sneaking
about
the
corner
of
the
house
what
the
matter
old
man
said
babbitt
is
that
you
thin
owld
one
gee
ma
certainly
is
on
the
warpath
i
told
her
rone
and
i
would
jus
soon
not
be
let
in
on
the
fiesta
and
she
bit
me
she
says
i
got
to
take
a
bath
too
but
say
the
babbitt
men
will
be
some
lookers
little
theodore
in
a
the
babbitt
men
babbitt
liked
the
sound
of
it
he
put
his
arm
about
the
boy
shoulder
he
wished
that
paul
riesling
had
a
daughter
so
that
ted
might
marry
her
yes
your
mother
is
kind
of
rouncing
round
all
right
he
said
and
they
laughed
together
and
sighed
together
and
dutifully
went
in
to
dress
the
mckelveys
were
less
than
fifteen
minutes
late
babbitt
hoped
that
the
doppelbraus
would
see
the
mckelveys
limousine
and
their
uniformed
chauffeur
waiting
in
front
the
dinner
was
well
cooked
and
incredibly
plentiful
and
babbitt
had
brought
out
her
grandmother
silver
candlesticks
babbitt
worked
hard
he
was
good
he
told
none
of
the
jokes
he
wanted
to
tell
he
listened
to
the
others
he
started
maxwell
off
with
a
resounding
hear
about
your
trip
to
the
he
was
laudatory
extremely
laudatory
he
found
opportunities
to
remark
that
angus
was
a
benefactor
to
humanity
maxwell
and
howard
littlefield
profound
scholars
charles
mckelvey
an
inspiration
to
ambitious
youth
and
mckelvey
an
adornment
to
the
social
circles
of
zenith
washington
new
york
paris
and
numbers
of
other
places
but
he
could
not
stir
them
it
was
a
dinner
without
a
soul
for
no
reason
that
was
clear
to
babbitt
heaviness
was
over
them
and
they
spoke
laboriously
and
unwillingly
he
concentrated
on
lucille
mckelvey
carefully
not
looking
at
her
blanched
lovely
shoulder
and
the
tawny
silken
bared
which
supported
her
frock
i
suppose
you
be
going
to
europe
pretty
soon
again
wo
you
he
invited
i
like
awfully
to
run
over
to
rome
for
a
few
i
suppose
you
see
a
lot
of
pictures
and
music
and
curios
and
everything
no
what
i
really
go
for
is
there
a
little
trattoria
on
the
via
della
scrofa
where
you
get
the
best
fettuccine
in
the
oh
i
yes
that
must
be
nice
to
try
that
at
a
quarter
to
ten
mckelvey
discovered
with
profound
regret
that
his
wife
had
a
headache
he
said
blithely
as
babbitt
helped
him
with
his
coat
we
must
lunch
together
some
time
and
talk
over
the
old
when
the
others
had
labored
out
at
ten
babbitt
turned
to
his
wife
pleading
charley
said
he
had
a
corking
time
and
we
must
lunch
said
they
wanted
to
have
us
up
to
the
house
for
dinner
before
she
achieved
oh
it
just
been
one
of
those
quiet
evenings
that
are
often
so
much
more
enjoyable
than
noisy
parties
where
everybody
talks
at
once
and
does
really
settle
down
quiet
but
from
his
cot
on
the
he
heard
her
weeping
slowly
without
hope
iv
for
a
month
they
watched
the
social
columns
and
waited
for
a
return
as
the
hosts
of
sir
gerald
doak
the
mckelveys
were
headlined
all
the
week
after
the
babbitts
dinner
zenith
ardently
received
sir
gerald
who
had
come
to
america
to
buy
coal
the
newspapers
interviewed
him
on
prohibition
ireland
unemployment
naval
aviation
the
rate
of
exchange
versus
the
psychology
of
american
women
and
daily
life
as
lived
by
english
county
families
sir
gerald
seemed
to
have
heard
of
all
those
topics
the
mckelveys
gave
him
a
singhalese
dinner
and
miss
elnora
pearl
bates
society
editor
of
the
rose
to
her
highest
babbitt
read
aloud
at
the
original
and
oriental
decorations
the
strange
and
delicious
food
and
the
personalities
both
of
the
distinguished
guests
the
charming
hostess
and
the
noted
host
never
has
zenith
seen
a
more
recherche
affair
than
the
ceylon
given
last
evening
by
and
charles
mckelvey
to
sir
gerald
doak
methought
as
we
fortunate
one
were
privileged
to
view
that
fairy
and
foreign
scene
nothing
at
monte
carlo
or
the
choicest
ambassadorial
sets
of
foreign
capitals
could
be
more
lovely
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
zenith
is
in
matters
social
rapidly
becoming
known
as
the
choosiest
inland
city
in
the
country
though
he
is
too
modest
to
admit
it
lord
doak
gives
a
cachet
to
our
smart
quartier
such
as
it
has
not
received
since
the
visit
of
the
earl
of
sittingbourne
not
only
is
he
of
the
british
peerage
but
he
is
also
on
dit
a
leader
of
the
british
metal
industries
as
he
comes
from
nottingham
a
favorite
haunt
of
robin
hood
though
now
we
are
informed
by
lord
doak
a
live
modern
city
of
inhabitants
and
important
lace
as
well
as
other
industries
we
like
to
think
that
perhaps
through
his
veins
runs
some
of
the
blood
both
virile
red
and
bonny
blue
of
that
earlier
lord
o
the
good
greenwood
the
roguish
robin
the
lovely
mckelvey
never
was
more
fascinating
than
last
evening
in
her
black
net
gown
relieved
by
dainty
bands
of
silver
and
at
her
exquisite
waist
a
glowing
cluster
of
aaron
ward
roses
babbitt
said
bravely
i
hope
they
do
invite
us
to
meet
this
lord
doak
guy
darn
sight
rather
just
have
a
nice
quiet
little
dinner
with
charley
and
the
at
the
zenith
athletic
club
they
discussed
it
amply
i
have
to
call
mckelvey
chaz
from
now
on
said
sidney
finkelstein
it
beats
all
meditated
that
man
of
data
howard
littlefield
how
hard
it
is
for
some
people
to
get
things
straight
here
they
call
this
fellow
doak
when
it
ought
to
be
gerald
babbitt
marvelled
is
that
a
fact
well
well
gerald
eh
what
you
call
um
eh
well
sir
i
glad
to
know
later
he
informed
his
salesmen
it
funnier
a
goat
the
way
some
folks
that
just
because
they
happen
to
lay
up
a
big
wad
go
entertaining
famous
foreigners
do
have
any
more
idea
a
rabbit
how
to
address
so
to
make
feel
at
home
that
evening
as
he
was
driving
home
he
passed
mckelvey
limousine
and
saw
sir
gerald
a
large
ruddy
teutonic
englishman
whose
dribble
of
yellow
mustache
gave
him
an
aspect
sad
and
doubtful
babbitt
drove
on
slowly
oppressed
by
futility
he
had
a
sudden
unexplained
and
horrible
conviction
that
the
mckelveys
were
laughing
at
him
he
betrayed
his
depression
by
the
violence
with
which
he
informed
his
wife
folks
that
really
tend
to
business
have
got
the
time
to
waste
on
a
bunch
like
the
mckelveys
this
society
stuff
is
like
any
other
hobby
if
you
devote
yourself
to
it
you
get
on
but
i
like
to
have
a
chance
to
visit
with
you
and
the
children
instead
of
all
this
idiotic
chasing
they
did
not
speak
of
the
mckelveys
again
v
it
was
a
shame
at
this
worried
time
to
have
to
think
about
the
overbrooks
ed
overbrook
was
a
classmate
of
babbitt
who
had
been
a
failure
he
had
a
large
family
and
a
feeble
insurance
business
out
in
the
suburb
of
dorchester
he
was
gray
and
thin
and
unimportant
he
had
always
been
gray
and
thin
and
unimportant
he
was
the
person
whom
in
any
group
you
forgot
to
introduce
then
introduced
with
extra
enthusiasm
he
had
admired
babbitt
in
college
had
admired
ever
since
his
power
in
real
estate
his
beautiful
house
and
wonderful
clothes
it
pleased
babbitt
though
it
bothered
him
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
at
the
he
had
seen
poor
overbrook
in
a
shiny
blue
serge
being
diffident
in
a
corner
with
three
other
failures
he
had
gone
over
and
been
cordial
why
hello
young
ed
i
hear
writing
all
the
insurance
in
dorchester
now
bully
work
they
recalled
the
good
old
days
when
overbrook
used
to
write
poetry
overbrook
embarrassed
him
by
blurting
say
georgie
i
hate
to
think
of
how
we
been
drifting
apart
i
wish
you
and
babbitt
would
come
to
dinner
some
babbitt
boomed
fine
sure
just
let
me
know
and
the
wife
and
i
want
to
have
you
at
the
he
forgot
it
but
unfortunately
ed
overbrook
did
not
repeatedly
he
telephoned
to
babbitt
inviting
him
to
dinner
might
as
well
go
and
get
it
over
babbitt
groaned
to
his
wife
but
do
it
simply
amaze
you
the
way
the
poor
fish
does
know
the
first
thing
about
social
etiquette
think
of
him
me
instead
of
his
wife
sitting
down
and
writing
us
a
regular
bid
well
i
guess
we
stuck
for
it
that
the
trouble
with
all
this
he
accepted
overbrook
next
plaintive
invitation
for
an
evening
two
weeks
off
a
dinner
two
weeks
off
even
a
family
dinner
never
seems
so
appalling
till
the
two
weeks
have
astoundingly
disappeared
and
one
comes
dismayed
to
the
ambushed
hour
they
had
to
change
the
date
because
of
their
own
dinner
to
the
mckelveys
but
at
last
they
gloomily
drove
out
to
the
overbrooks
house
in
dorchester
it
was
miserable
from
the
beginning
the
overbrooks
had
dinner
at
while
the
babbitts
never
dined
before
seven
babbitt
permitted
himself
to
be
ten
minutes
late
let
make
it
as
short
as
possible
i
think
we
duck
out
quick
i
say
i
have
to
be
at
the
office
extra
early
he
planned
the
overbrook
house
was
depressing
it
was
the
second
story
of
a
wooden
dwelling
a
place
of
old
hats
hung
in
the
hall
and
a
family
bible
on
the
parlor
table
ed
overbrook
and
his
wife
were
as
awkward
and
threadbare
as
usual
and
the
other
guests
were
two
dreadful
families
whose
names
babbitt
never
caught
and
never
desired
to
catch
but
he
was
touched
and
disconcerted
by
the
tactless
way
in
which
overbrook
praised
him
we
mighty
proud
to
have
old
george
here
of
course
you
all
read
about
his
speeches
and
oratory
in
the
papers
and
the
boy
too
eh
but
what
i
always
think
of
is
back
in
college
and
what
a
great
old
mixer
he
was
and
one
of
the
best
swimmers
in
the
babbitt
tried
to
be
jovial
he
worked
at
it
but
he
could
find
nothing
to
interest
him
in
overbrook
timorousness
the
blankness
of
the
other
guests
or
the
drained
stupidity
of
overbrook
with
her
spectacles
drab
skin
and
hair
he
told
his
best
irish
story
but
it
sank
like
soggy
cake
most
bleary
moment
of
all
was
when
overbrook
peering
out
of
her
fog
of
nursing
eight
children
and
cooking
and
scrubbing
tried
to
be
conversational
i
suppose
you
go
to
chicago
and
new
york
right
along
babbitt
she
prodded
well
i
get
to
chicago
fairly
it
must
be
awfully
interesting
i
suppose
you
take
in
all
the
well
to
tell
the
truth
overbrook
thing
that
hits
me
best
is
a
great
big
beefsteak
at
a
dutch
restaurant
in
the
loop
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
babbitt
was
sorry
but
there
was
no
hope
the
dinner
was
a
failure
at
ten
rousing
out
of
the
stupor
of
meaningless
talk
he
said
as
cheerily
as
he
could
we
got
to
be
starting
ed
i
got
a
fellow
coming
to
see
me
early
as
overbrook
helped
him
with
his
coat
babbitt
said
nice
to
rub
up
on
the
old
days
we
must
have
lunch
together
babbitt
sighed
on
their
drive
home
it
was
pretty
terrible
but
how
overbrook
does
admire
you
yep
poor
cuss
seems
to
think
i
a
little
tin
archangel
and
the
man
in
well
you
certainly
not
that
but
oh
georgie
you
do
suppose
we
have
to
invite
them
to
dinner
at
our
house
now
do
we
ouch
gaw
i
hope
not
see
here
now
george
you
did
say
anything
about
it
to
overbrook
did
you
no
gee
no
honest
i
did
just
made
a
bluff
about
having
him
to
lunch
some
well
oh
dear
i
do
want
to
hurt
their
feelings
but
i
do
see
how
i
could
stand
another
evening
like
this
one
and
suppose
somebody
like
and
angus
came
in
when
we
had
the
overbrooks
there
and
thought
they
were
friends
of
ours
for
a
week
they
worried
we
really
ought
to
invite
ed
and
his
wife
poor
devils
but
as
they
never
saw
the
overbrooks
they
forgot
them
and
after
a
month
or
two
they
said
that
really
was
the
best
way
just
to
let
it
slide
it
would
be
kind
to
them
to
have
them
here
feel
so
out
of
place
and
in
our
they
did
not
speak
of
the
overbrooks
again
chapter
xvi
the
certainty
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
accepted
by
the
mckelveys
made
babbitt
feel
guilty
and
a
little
absurd
but
he
went
more
regularly
to
the
elks
at
a
chamber
of
commerce
luncheon
he
was
oratorical
regarding
the
wickedness
of
strikes
and
again
he
saw
himself
as
a
prominent
citizen
his
clubs
and
associations
were
food
comfortable
to
his
spirit
of
a
decent
man
in
zenith
it
was
required
that
he
should
belong
to
one
preferably
two
or
three
of
the
innumerous
lodges
and
to
the
rotarians
the
kiwanis
or
the
boosters
to
the
oddfellows
moose
masons
red
men
woodmen
owls
eagles
maccabees
knights
of
pythias
knights
of
columbus
and
other
secret
orders
characterized
by
a
high
degree
of
heartiness
sound
morals
and
reverence
for
the
constitution
there
were
four
reasons
for
joining
these
orders
it
was
the
thing
to
do
it
was
good
for
business
since
frequently
became
customers
it
gave
to
americans
unable
to
become
geheimrate
or
commendatori
such
unctuous
honorifics
as
high
worthy
recording
scribe
and
grand
hoogow
to
add
to
the
commonplace
distinctions
of
colonel
judge
and
professor
and
it
permitted
the
swaddled
american
husband
to
stay
away
from
home
for
one
evening
a
week
the
lodge
was
his
piazza
his
pavement
cafe
he
could
shoot
pool
and
talk
and
be
obscene
and
valiant
babbitt
was
what
he
called
a
joiner
for
all
these
reasons
behind
the
gold
and
scarlet
banner
of
his
public
achievements
was
the
dun
background
of
leases
lists
of
properties
to
rent
the
evenings
of
oratory
and
committees
and
lodges
stimulated
him
like
brandy
but
every
morning
he
was
week
by
week
he
accumulated
nervousness
he
was
in
open
disagreement
with
his
outside
salesman
stanley
graff
and
once
though
her
charms
had
always
kept
him
nickeringly
polite
to
her
he
snarled
at
miss
mcgoun
for
changing
his
letters
but
in
the
presence
of
paul
riesling
he
relaxed
at
least
once
a
week
they
fled
from
maturity
on
saturday
they
played
golf
jeering
as
a
golfer
you
a
fine
or
they
motored
all
sunday
afternoon
stopping
at
village
lunchrooms
to
sit
on
high
stools
at
a
counter
and
drink
coffee
from
thick
cups
sometimes
paul
came
over
in
the
evening
with
his
violin
and
even
zilla
was
silent
as
the
lonely
man
who
had
lost
his
way
and
forever
crept
down
unfamiliar
roads
spun
out
his
dark
soul
in
music
ii
nothing
gave
babbitt
more
purification
and
publicity
than
his
labors
for
the
sunday
school
his
church
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
was
one
of
the
largest
and
richest
one
of
the
most
oaken
and
velvety
in
zenith
the
pastor
was
the
reverend
john
jennison
drew
the
and
the
were
from
elbert
university
nebraska
the
from
waterbury
college
oklahoma
he
was
eloquent
efficient
and
versatile
he
presided
at
meetings
for
the
denunciation
of
unions
or
the
elevation
of
domestic
service
and
confided
to
the
audiences
that
as
a
poor
boy
he
had
carried
newspapers
for
the
saturday
edition
of
the
evening
advocate
he
wrote
editorials
on
the
manly
man
religion
and
the
dollars
and
sense
value
of
christianity
which
were
printed
in
bold
type
surrounded
by
a
wiggly
border
he
often
said
that
he
was
proud
to
be
known
as
primarily
a
business
man
and
that
he
certainly
was
not
going
to
permit
the
old
satan
to
monopolize
all
the
pep
and
he
was
a
thin
young
man
with
gold
spectacles
and
a
bang
of
dull
brown
hair
but
when
he
hurled
himself
into
oratory
he
glowed
with
power
he
admitted
that
he
was
too
much
the
scholar
and
poet
to
imitate
the
evangelist
mike
monday
yet
he
had
once
awakened
his
fold
to
new
life
and
to
larger
collections
by
the
challenge
my
brethren
the
real
cheap
skate
is
the
man
who
wo
lend
to
the
lord
he
had
made
his
church
a
true
community
center
it
contained
everything
but
a
bar
it
had
a
nursery
a
thursday
evening
supper
with
a
short
bright
missionary
lecture
afterward
a
gymnasium
a
fortnightly
show
a
library
of
technical
books
for
young
workmen
though
unfortunately
no
young
workman
ever
entered
the
church
except
to
wash
the
windows
or
repair
the
furnace
and
a
which
made
short
little
pants
for
the
children
of
the
poor
while
drew
read
aloud
from
earnest
novels
though
drew
theology
was
presbyterian
his
was
gracefully
episcopalian
as
he
said
it
had
the
most
perdurable
features
of
those
noble
ecclesiastical
monuments
of
grand
old
england
which
stand
as
symbols
of
the
eternity
of
faith
religious
and
it
was
built
of
cheery
brick
in
an
improved
gothic
style
and
the
main
auditorium
had
indirect
lighting
from
electric
globes
in
lavish
alabaster
bowls
on
a
december
morning
when
the
babbitts
went
to
church
john
jennison
drew
was
unusually
eloquent
the
crowd
was
immense
ten
brisk
young
ushers
in
morning
coats
with
white
roses
were
bringing
folding
chairs
up
from
the
basement
there
was
an
impressive
musical
program
conducted
by
sheldon
smeeth
educational
director
of
the
who
also
sang
the
offertory
babbitt
cared
less
for
this
because
some
misguided
person
had
taught
young
smeeth
to
smile
smile
smile
while
he
was
singing
but
with
all
the
appreciation
of
a
he
admired
drew
sermon
it
had
the
intellectual
quality
which
distinguished
the
chatham
road
congregation
from
the
grubby
chapels
on
smith
street
at
this
abundant
of
all
the
year
drew
chanted
when
though
stormy
the
sky
and
laborious
the
path
to
the
drudging
wayfarer
yet
the
hovering
and
bodiless
spirit
swoops
back
all
the
labors
and
desires
of
the
past
twelve
months
oh
then
it
seems
to
me
there
sounds
behind
all
our
apparent
failures
the
golden
chorus
of
greeting
from
those
passed
happily
on
and
lo
on
the
dim
horizon
we
see
behind
dolorous
clouds
the
mighty
mass
of
mountains
mountains
of
melody
mountains
of
mirth
mountains
of
might
i
certainly
do
like
a
sermon
with
culture
and
thought
in
it
meditated
babbitt
at
the
end
of
the
service
he
was
delighted
when
the
pastor
actively
shaking
hands
at
the
door
twittered
oh
brother
babbitt
can
you
wait
a
jiffy
want
your
sure
doctor
you
bet
drop
into
my
office
i
think
you
like
the
cigars
babbitt
did
like
the
cigars
he
also
liked
the
office
which
was
distinguished
from
other
offices
only
by
the
spirited
change
of
the
familiar
to
this
is
the
lord
busy
chum
frink
came
in
then
william
eathorne
eathorne
was
the
president
of
the
first
state
bank
of
zenith
he
still
wore
the
delicate
patches
of
which
had
been
the
uniform
of
bankers
in
if
babbitt
was
envious
of
the
smart
set
of
the
mckelveys
before
william
washington
eathorne
he
was
reverent
eathorne
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
smart
set
he
was
above
it
he
was
the
of
one
of
the
five
men
who
founded
zenith
in
and
he
was
of
the
third
generation
of
bankers
he
could
examine
credits
make
loans
promote
or
injure
a
man
business
in
his
presence
babbitt
breathed
quickly
and
felt
young
the
reverend
drew
bounced
into
the
room
and
flowered
into
speech
i
asked
you
gentlemen
to
stay
so
i
can
put
a
proposition
before
you
the
sunday
school
needs
bucking
up
it
the
fourth
largest
in
zenith
but
there
no
reason
why
we
should
take
anybody
dust
we
ought
to
be
first
i
want
to
request
you
if
you
will
to
form
a
committee
of
advice
and
publicity
for
the
sunday
school
look
it
over
and
make
any
suggestions
for
its
betterment
and
then
perhaps
see
that
the
press
gives
us
some
attention
give
the
public
some
really
helpful
and
constructive
news
instead
of
all
these
murders
and
excellent
said
the
banker
babbitt
and
frink
were
enchanted
to
join
him
iii
if
you
had
asked
babbitt
what
his
religion
was
he
would
have
answered
in
sonorous
rhetoric
my
religion
is
to
serve
my
fellow
men
to
honor
my
brother
as
myself
and
to
do
my
bit
to
make
life
happier
for
one
and
if
you
had
pressed
him
for
more
detail
he
would
have
announced
i
a
member
of
the
presbyterian
church
and
naturally
i
accept
its
if
you
had
been
so
brutal
as
to
go
on
he
would
have
protested
there
no
use
discussing
and
arguing
about
religion
it
just
stirs
up
bad
actually
the
content
of
his
theology
was
that
there
was
a
supreme
being
who
had
tried
to
make
us
perfect
but
presumably
had
failed
that
if
one
was
a
good
man
he
would
go
to
a
place
called
heaven
babbitt
unconsciously
pictured
it
as
rather
like
an
excellent
hotel
with
a
private
garden
but
if
one
was
a
bad
man
that
is
if
he
murdered
or
committed
burglary
or
used
cocaine
or
had
mistresses
or
sold
real
estate
he
would
be
punished
babbitt
was
uncertain
however
about
what
he
called
this
business
of
he
explained
to
ted
of
course
i
pretty
liberal
i
do
exactly
believe
in
a
hell
stands
to
reason
though
that
a
fellow
get
away
with
all
sorts
of
vice
and
not
get
nicked
for
it
see
how
i
mean
upon
this
theology
he
rarely
pondered
the
kernel
of
his
practical
religion
was
that
it
was
respectable
and
beneficial
to
one
business
to
be
seen
going
to
services
that
the
church
kept
the
worst
elements
from
being
still
worse
and
that
the
pastor
sermons
however
dull
they
might
seem
at
the
time
of
taking
yet
had
a
voodooistic
power
which
did
a
fellow
good
kept
him
in
touch
with
higher
his
first
investigations
for
the
sunday
school
advisory
committee
did
not
inspire
him
he
liked
the
busy
folks
bible
class
composed
of
mature
men
and
women
and
addressed
by
the
physician
atkins
jordan
in
a
sparkling
style
comparable
to
that
of
the
more
refined
humorous
speakers
but
when
he
went
down
to
the
junior
classes
he
was
disconcerted
he
heard
sheldon
smeeth
educational
director
of
the
and
leader
of
the
a
pale
but
strenuous
young
man
with
curly
hair
and
a
smile
teaching
a
class
of
boys
smeeth
lovingly
admonished
them
now
fellows
i
going
to
have
a
heart
to
heart
talk
evening
at
my
house
next
thursday
we
get
off
by
ourselves
and
be
frank
about
our
secret
worries
you
can
just
tell
old
sheldy
anything
like
all
the
fellows
do
at
the
i
going
to
explain
frankly
about
the
horrible
practises
a
kiddy
falls
into
unless
guided
by
a
big
brother
and
about
the
perils
and
glory
of
old
sheldy
beamed
damply
the
boys
looked
ashamed
and
babbitt
did
know
which
way
to
turn
his
embarrassed
eyes
less
annoying
but
also
much
duller
were
the
minor
classes
which
were
being
instructed
in
philosophy
and
oriental
ethnology
by
earnest
spinsters
most
of
them
met
in
the
highly
varnished
sunday
school
room
but
there
was
an
overflow
to
the
basement
which
was
decorated
with
varicose
and
lighted
by
small
windows
high
up
in
the
oozing
wall
what
babbitt
saw
however
was
the
first
congregational
church
of
catawba
he
was
back
in
the
sunday
school
of
his
boyhood
he
smelled
again
that
polite
stuffiness
to
be
found
only
in
church
parlors
he
recalled
the
case
of
drab
sunday
school
books
hetty
a
humble
heroine
and
josephus
a
lad
of
palestine
he
thumbed
once
more
the
which
no
boy
wanted
but
no
boy
liked
to
throw
away
because
they
were
somehow
sacred
he
was
tortured
by
the
stumbling
rote
of
years
ago
as
in
the
vast
zenith
church
he
listened
to
now
edgar
you
read
the
next
verse
what
does
it
mean
when
it
says
it
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
needle
eye
what
does
this
teach
us
clarence
please
do
wiggle
so
if
you
had
studied
your
lesson
you
would
be
so
fidgety
now
earl
what
is
the
lesson
jesus
was
trying
to
teach
his
disciples
the
one
thing
i
want
you
to
especially
remember
boys
is
the
words
god
all
things
are
possible
just
think
of
that
always
clarence
please
pay
attention
just
say
god
all
things
are
possible
whenever
you
feel
discouraged
and
alec
will
you
read
the
next
verse
if
you
pay
attention
you
would
lose
your
place
drone
drone
drone
gigantic
bees
that
boomed
in
a
cavern
of
drowsiness
babbitt
started
from
his
nap
thanked
the
teacher
for
the
privilege
of
listening
to
her
splendid
teaching
and
staggered
on
to
the
next
circle
after
two
weeks
of
this
he
had
no
suggestions
whatever
for
the
reverend
drew
then
he
discovered
a
world
of
sunday
school
journals
an
enormous
and
busy
domain
of
weeklies
and
monthlies
which
were
as
technical
as
practical
and
as
the
columns
or
the
magazines
he
bought
half
a
dozen
of
them
at
a
religious
and
till
after
midnight
he
read
them
and
admired
he
found
many
lucrative
tips
on
focusing
appeals
scouting
for
new
members
and
getting
prospects
to
sign
up
with
the
sunday
he
particularly
liked
the
word
prospects
and
he
was
moved
by
the
rubric
the
moral
springs
of
the
community
life
lie
deep
in
its
sunday
schools
its
schools
of
religious
instruction
and
inspiration
neglect
now
means
loss
of
spiritual
vigor
and
moral
power
in
years
to
come
facts
like
the
above
followed
by
a
appeal
will
reach
folks
who
can
never
be
laughed
or
jollied
into
doing
their
babbitt
admitted
that
so
i
used
to
skin
out
of
the
ole
sunday
school
at
catawba
every
chance
i
got
but
same
time
i
would
be
where
i
am
maybe
if
it
had
been
for
its
training
in
in
moral
power
and
all
about
the
bible
great
literature
have
to
read
some
of
it
again
one
of
these
days
how
scientifically
the
sunday
school
could
be
organized
he
learned
from
an
article
in
the
westminster
adult
bible
class
the
second
looks
after
the
fellowship
of
the
class
she
chooses
a
group
to
help
her
these
become
ushers
every
one
who
comes
gets
a
glad
hand
no
one
goes
away
a
stranger
one
member
of
the
group
stands
on
the
doorstep
and
invites
to
come
perhaps
most
of
all
babbitt
appreciated
the
remarks
by
william
ridgway
in
the
sunday
school
times
if
you
have
a
sunday
school
class
without
any
pep
and
in
it
that
is
without
interest
that
is
uncertain
in
attendance
that
acts
like
a
fellow
with
the
spring
fever
let
old
ridgway
write
you
a
prescription
rx
invite
the
bunch
for
the
sunday
school
journals
were
as
well
rounded
as
they
were
practical
they
neglected
none
of
the
arts
as
to
music
the
sunday
school
times
advertised
that
harold
lowden
known
to
thousands
through
his
sacred
compositions
had
written
a
new
masterpiece
entitled
for
you
the
poem
by
harry
kerr
is
one
of
the
daintiest
you
could
imagine
and
the
music
is
indescribably
beautiful
critics
are
agreed
that
it
will
sweep
the
country
may
be
made
into
a
charming
sacred
song
by
substituting
the
hymn
words
heard
the
voice
of
jesus
say
even
manual
training
was
adequately
considered
babbitt
noted
an
ingenious
way
of
illustrating
the
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
model
for
pupils
to
make
tomb
with
rolling
use
a
square
covered
box
turned
upside
down
pull
the
cover
forward
a
little
to
form
a
groove
at
the
bottom
cut
a
square
door
also
cut
a
circle
of
cardboard
to
more
than
cover
the
door
cover
the
circular
door
and
the
tomb
thickly
with
stiff
mixture
of
sand
flour
and
water
and
let
it
dry
it
was
the
heavy
circular
stone
over
the
door
the
women
found
away
on
easter
morning
this
is
the
story
we
are
to
in
their
advertisements
the
sunday
school
journals
were
thoroughly
efficient
babbitt
was
interested
in
a
preparation
which
takes
the
place
of
exercise
for
sedentary
men
by
building
up
depleted
nerve
tissue
nourishing
the
brain
and
the
digestive
he
was
edified
to
learn
that
the
selling
of
bibles
was
a
hustling
and
strictly
competitive
industry
and
as
an
expert
on
hygiene
he
was
pleased
by
the
sanitary
communion
outfit
company
announcement
of
an
improved
and
satisfactory
outfit
throughout
including
highly
polished
beautiful
mahogany

eliminates
all
noise
is
lighter
and
more
easily
handled
than
others
and
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
furniture
of
the
church
than
a
tray
of
any
other
iv
he
dropped
the
pile
of
sunday
school
journals
he
pondered
now
there
a
real
corking
ashamed
i
have
sat
in
more
fellow
that
an
influence
in
the
community
shame
if
he
does
take
part
in
a
real
virile
hustling
religion
sort
of
christianity
incorporated
you
might
say
but
with
all
reverence
some
folks
might
claim
these
sunday
school
fans
are
undignified
and
unspiritual
and
so
on
sure
always
some
skunk
to
spring
things
like
that
knocking
and
sneering
and
so
much
easier
than
building
up
but
me
i
certainly
hand
it
to
these
magazines
brought
ole
george
babbitt
into
camp
and
that
the
answer
to
the
critics
the
more
manly
and
practical
a
fellow
is
the
more
he
ought
to
lead
the
enterprising
christian
life
me
for
it
cut
out
this
carelessness
and
boozing
and
rone
where
the
devil
you
been
this
is
a
fine
time
night
to
be
coming
in
chapter
xvii
i
there
are
but
three
or
four
old
houses
in
floral
heights
and
in
floral
heights
an
old
house
is
one
which
was
built
before
the
largest
of
these
is
the
residence
of
william
washington
eathorne
president
of
the
first
state
bank
the
eathorne
mansion
preserves
the
memory
of
the
nice
parts
of
zenith
as
they
appeared
from
to
it
is
a
red
brick
immensity
with
gray
sandstone
lintels
and
a
roof
of
slate
in
courses
of
red
green
and
dyspeptic
yellow
there
are
two
anemic
towers
one
roofed
with
copper
the
other
crowned
with
castiron
ferns
the
porch
is
like
an
open
tomb
it
is
supported
by
squat
granite
pillars
above
which
hang
frozen
cascades
of
brick
at
one
side
of
the
house
is
a
huge
window
in
the
shape
of
a
keyhole
but
the
house
has
an
effect
not
at
all
humorous
it
embodies
the
heavy
dignity
of
those
victorian
financiers
who
ruled
the
generation
between
the
pioneers
and
the
brisk
and
created
a
somber
oligarchy
by
gaining
control
of
banks
mills
land
railroads
mines
out
of
the
dozen
contradictory
zeniths
which
together
make
up
the
true
and
complete
zenith
none
is
so
powerful
and
enduring
yet
none
so
unfamiliar
to
the
citizens
as
the
small
still
dry
polite
cruel
zenith
of
the
william
eathornes
and
for
that
tiny
hierarchy
the
other
zeniths
unwittingly
labor
and
insignificantly
die
most
of
the
castles
of
the
testy
victorian
tetrarchs
are
gone
now
or
decayed
into
but
the
eathorne
mansion
remains
virtuous
and
aloof
reminiscent
of
london
back
bay
rittenhouse
square
its
marble
steps
are
scrubbed
daily
the
brass
plate
is
reverently
polished
and
the
lace
curtains
are
as
prim
and
superior
as
william
washington
eathorne
himself
with
a
certain
awe
babbitt
and
chum
frink
called
on
eathorne
for
a
meeting
of
the
sunday
school
advisory
committee
with
uneasy
stillness
they
followed
a
uniformed
maid
through
catacombs
of
to
the
library
it
was
as
unmistakably
the
library
of
a
solid
old
banker
as
eathorne
were
the
of
a
solid
old
banker
the
books
were
most
of
them
standard
sets
with
the
correct
and
traditional
touch
of
dim
blue
dim
gold
and
glossy
the
fire
was
exactly
correct
and
traditional
a
small
quiet
steady
fire
reflected
by
polished
the
oak
desk
was
dark
and
old
and
altogether
perfect
the
chairs
were
gently
supercilious
eathorne
inquiries
as
to
the
healths
of
babbitt
miss
babbitt
and
the
other
children
were
softly
paternal
but
babbitt
had
nothing
with
which
to
answer
him
it
was
indecent
to
think
of
using
the
tricks
ole
socks
which
gratified
vergil
gunch
and
frink
and
howard
littlefield
men
who
till
now
had
seemed
successful
and
urbane
babbitt
and
frink
sat
politely
and
politely
did
eathorne
observe
opening
his
thin
lips
just
wide
enough
to
dismiss
the
words
gentlemen
before
we
begin
our
conference
you
may
have
felt
the
cold
in
coming
here
so
good
of
you
to
save
an
old
man
the
journey
shall
we
perhaps
have
a
whisky
toddy
so
well
trained
was
babbitt
in
all
the
conversation
that
befits
a
good
fellow
that
he
almost
disgraced
himself
with
rather
than
make
trouble
and
always
providin
there
ai
any
enforcement
officers
hiding
in
the
the
words
died
choking
in
his
throat
he
bowed
in
flustered
obedience
so
did
chum
frink
eathorne
rang
for
the
maid
the
modern
and
luxurious
babbitt
had
never
seen
any
one
ring
for
a
servant
in
a
private
house
except
during
meals
himself
in
hotels
had
rung
for
but
in
the
house
you
did
hurt
matilda
feelings
you
went
out
in
the
hall
and
shouted
for
her
nor
had
he
since
prohibition
known
any
one
to
be
casual
about
drinking
it
was
extraordinary
merely
to
sip
his
toddy
and
not
cry
oh
maaaaan
this
hits
me
right
where
i
live
and
always
with
the
ecstasy
of
youth
meeting
greatness
he
marveled
that
little
there
why
he
could
make
me
or
break
me
if
he
told
my
banker
to
call
my
loans
gosh
that
squirt
and
looking
like
he
had
got
a
single
bit
of
hustle
to
him
i
wonder
do
we
boosters
throw
too
many
fits
about
pep
from
this
thought
he
shuddered
away
and
listened
devoutly
to
ideas
on
the
advancement
of
the
sunday
school
which
were
very
clear
and
very
bad
diffidently
babbitt
outlined
his
own
suggestions
i
think
if
you
analyze
the
needs
of
the
school
in
fact
going
right
at
it
as
if
it
was
a
merchandizing
problem
of
course
the
one
basic
and
fundamental
need
is
growth
i
presume
we
all
agreed
we
wo
be
satisfied
till
we
build
up
the
biggest
darn
sunday
school
in
the
whole
state
so
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
wo
have
to
take
anything
off
anybody
now
about
jazzing
up
the
campaign
for
prospects
already
used
contesting
teams
and
given
prizes
to
the
kids
that
bring
in
the
most
members
and
they
made
a
mistake
there
the
prizes
were
a
lot
of
folderols
and
doodads
like
poetry
books
and
illustrated
testaments
instead
of
something
a
real
live
kid
would
want
to
work
for
like
real
cash
or
a
speedometer
for
his
motor
cycle
course
i
suppose
it
all
fine
and
dandy
to
illustrate
the
lessons
with
these
decorated
and
blackboard
drawings
and
so
on
but
when
it
comes
down
to
real
getting
out
and
drumming
up
customers
or
members
i
mean
why
you
got
to
make
it
worth
a
fellow
while
now
i
want
to
propose
two
stunts
first
divide
the
sunday
school
into
four
armies
depending
on
age
everybody
gets
a
military
rank
in
his
own
army
according
to
how
many
members
he
brings
in
and
the
duffers
that
lie
down
on
us
and
do
bring
in
any
they
remain
privates
the
pastor
and
superintendent
rank
as
generals
and
everybody
has
got
to
give
salutes
and
all
the
rest
of
that
junk
just
like
a
regular
army
to
make
feel
it
worth
while
to
get
rank
then
second
course
the
school
has
its
advertising
committee
but
lord
nobody
ever
really
works
good
nobody
works
well
just
for
the
love
of
it
the
thing
to
do
is
to
be
practical
and
and
hire
a
real
paid
for
the
sunday
newspaper
fellow
who
can
give
part
of
his
sure
you
bet
said
chum
frink
think
of
the
nice
juicy
bits
he
could
get
in
babbitt
crowed
not
only
the
big
salient
vital
facts
about
how
fast
the
sunday
school
and
the
collection
is
growing
but
a
lot
of
humorous
gossip
and
kidding
about
how
some
blowhard
fell
down
on
his
pledge
to
get
new
members
or
the
good
time
the
sacred
trinity
class
of
girls
had
at
their
wieniewurst
party
and
on
the
side
if
he
had
time
the
might
even
boost
the
lessons
themselves
do
a
little
advertising
for
all
the
sunday
schools
in
town
in
fact
no
use
being
hoggish
toward
the
rest
of
providing
we
can
keep
the
bulge
on
in
membership
frinstance
he
might
get
the
papers
to
course
i
have
got
a
literary
training
like
frink
here
and
i
just
guessing
how
the
pieces
ought
to
be
written
but
take
frinstance
suppose
the
week
lesson
is
about
jacob
well
the
might
get
in
something
that
would
have
a
fine
moral
and
yet
with
a
trick
headline
that
get
folks
to
read
it
say
like
fools
the
old
man
makes
getaway
with
girl
and
bankroll
see
how
i
mean
that
get
their
interest
now
course
eathorne
you
conservative
and
maybe
you
feel
these
stunts
would
be
undignified
but
honestly
i
believe
they
bring
home
the
eathorne
folded
his
hands
on
his
comfortable
little
belly
and
purred
like
an
aged
pussy
may
i
say
first
that
i
have
been
very
much
pleased
by
your
analysis
of
the
situation
babbitt
as
you
surmise
it
necessary
in
my
position
to
be
conservative
and
perhaps
endeavor
to
maintain
a
certain
standard
of
dignity
yet
i
think
you
find
me
somewhat
progressive
in
our
bank
for
example
i
hope
i
may
say
that
we
have
as
modern
a
method
of
publicity
and
advertising
as
any
in
the
city
yes
i
fancy
find
us
oldsters
quite
cognizant
of
the
shifting
spiritual
values
of
the
age
yes
oh
yes
and
so
in
fact
it
pleases
me
to
be
able
to
say
that
though
personally
i
might
prefer
the
sterner
presbyterianism
of
an
earlier
era
babbitt
finally
gathered
that
eathorne
was
willing
chum
frink
suggested
as
one
kenneth
escott
reporter
on
the
they
parted
on
a
high
plane
of
amity
and
christian
helpfulness
babbitt
did
not
drive
home
but
toward
the
center
of
the
city
he
wished
to
be
by
himself
and
exult
over
the
beauty
of
intimacy
with
william
washington
eathorne
ii
a
evening
of
ringing
pavements
and
eager
lights
great
golden
lights
of
sliding
along
the
packed
snow
of
the
roadway
demure
lights
of
little
houses
the
belching
glare
of
a
distant
foundry
wiping
out
the
stars
lights
of
neighborhood
drug
stores
where

gossiped
well
pleased
after

the
green
light

and
greener
radiance
on

snow
the
drama
of
a
gong
beating
like
a
terrified
heart

dangling

in

boy

rich
the
air
was
shrewd
the
snow
was
deep
in
uncleared
alleys
and
beyond

city
babbitt
knew
were
hillsides
of
among
wintry
oaks
and
the
curving
river
he
loved
his
city
with
passionate
wonder
he
lost
the
accumulated
weariness
of
business
worry
and
expansive
oratory
he
felt
young
and
potential
he
was

was
not
enough
to
be

simply
lovely
but

rigorous
coldly
powerful

iii
young
kenneth

reporter
on
the
was
appointed
of
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
sunday
school
he
gave
six
hours
a
week
to
it
at
least
he
was
paid
for
giving
six
hours
a
week
he
had
friends
on
the
press
and
the
gazette
and
he
was
not
officially
known
as
a
he
procured
a
trickle
of
insinuating
items
about
neighborliness
and
the
bible
about
jolly
but
educational
and
the
value
of
the
in
attaining
financial
success
the
sunday
school
adopted
babbitt
system
of
military
ranks
quickened
by
this
spiritual
refreshment
it
had
a
boom
it
did
not
become
the
largest
school
in
zenith
the
central
methodist
church
kept
ahead
of
it
by
methods
which
drew
scored
as
unfair
undignified
ungentlemanly
and
unchristian
but
it
climbed
from
fourth
place
to
second
and
there
was
rejoicing
in
heaven
or
at
least
in
that
portion
of
heaven
included
in
the
parsonage
of
drew
while
babbitt
had
much
praise
and
good
repute
he
had
received
the
rank
of
colonel
on
the
general
staff
of
the
school
he
was
plumply
pleased
by
salutes
on
the
street
from
unknown
small
boys
his
ears
were
tickled
to
ruddy
ecstasy
by
hearing
himself
called
colonel
and
if
he
did
not
attend
sunday
school
merely
to
be
thus
exalted
certainly
he
thought
about
it
all
the
way
there
he
was
particularly
pleasant
to
the
kenneth
escott
he
took
him
to
lunch
at
the
athletic
club
and
had
him
at
the
house
for
dinner
like
many
of
the
cocksure
young
men
who
forage
about
cities
in
apparent
contentment
and
who
express
their
cynicism
in
supercilious
slang
escott
was
shy
and
lonely
his
shrewd
starveling
face
broadened
with
joy
at
dinner
and
he
blurted
gee
whillikins
babbitt
if
you
knew
how
good
it
is
to
have
home
eats
again
escott
and
verona
liked
each
other
all
evening
they
talked
about
they
discovered
that
they
were
radicals
true
they
were
sensible
about
it
they
agreed
that
all
communists
were
criminals
that
this
vers
libre
was
and
that
while
there
ought
to
be
universal
disarmament
of
course
great
britain
and
the
united
states
must
on
behalf
of
oppressed
small
nations
keep
a
navy
equal
to
the
tonnage
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
but
they
were
so
revolutionary
that
they
predicted
to
babbitt
irritation
that
there
would
some
day
be
a
third
party
which
would
give
trouble
to
the
republicans
and
democrats
escott
shook
hands
with
babbitt
three
times
at
parting
babbitt
mentioned
his
extreme
fondness
for
eathorne
within
a
week
three
newspapers
presented
accounts
of
babbitt
sterling
labors
for
religion
and
all
of
them
tactfully
mentioned
william
washington
eathorne
as
his
collaborator
nothing
had
brought
babbitt
quite
so
much
credit
at
the
elks
the
athletic
club
and
the
boosters
his
friends
had
always
congratulated
him
on
his
oratory
but
in
their
praise
was
doubt
for
even
in
speeches
advertising
the
city
there
was
something
highbrow
and
degenerate
like
writing
poetry
but
now
orville
jones
shouted
across
the
athletic
here
the
new
director
of
the
first
state
bank
grover
butterbaugh
the
eminent
wholesaler
of
plumbers
supplies
chuckled
wonder
you
mix
with
common
folks
after
holding
eathorne
hand
and
emil
wengert
the
jeweler
was
at
last
willing
to
discuss
buying
a
house
in
dorchester
iv
when
the
sunday
school
campaign
was
finished
babbitt
suggested
to
kenneth
escott
say
how
about
doing
a
little
boosting
for
doc
drew
personally
escott
grinned
you
trust
the
doc
to
do
a
little
boosting
for
himself
babbitt
there
hardly
a
week
goes
by
without
his
ringing
up
the
paper
to
say
if
we
chase
a
reporter
up
to
his
study
he
let
us
in
on
the
story
about
the
swell
sermon
he
going
to
preach
on
the
wickedness
of
short
skirts
or
the
authorship
of
the
pentateuch
you
worry
about
him
there
just
one
better
in
town
and
that
this
dora
gibson
tucker
that
runs
the
child
welfare
and
the
americanization
league
and
the
only
reason
she
got
drew
beaten
is
because
she
has
got
some
brains
well
now
kenneth
i
do
think
you
ought
to
talk
that
way
about
the
doctor
a
preacher
has
to
watch
his
interests
has
he
you
remember
that
in
the
bible
about
about
being
diligent
in
the
lord
business
or
something
all
right
i
get
something
in
if
you
want
me
to
babbitt
but
i
have
to
wait
till
the
managing
editor
is
out
of
town
and
then
blackjack
the
city
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
sunday
under
a
picture
of
drew
at
his
earnestest
with
eyes
alert
jaw
as
granite
and
rustic
lock
flamboyant

he
holds
the
local
record
for
conversions
during
his
shepherdhood
an
average
of
almost
a
hundred
persons
per
year
have
declared
their
resolve
to
lead
a
new
life
and
have
found
a
harbor
of

and
peace
everything

at

the
subsidiary

are
keyed
to
the
of

drew
is
especially
keen
on
good
congregational
singing
bright
cheerful

the
special

well
as

a
renowned
and
during
the
course
of
the
year
he
receives
literally
scores
of
invitations
to

both
here
and
elsewhere
v
babbitt
let
drew
know
that
he
was
responsible
for
this
tribute
drew
called
him
brother
and
shook
his
hand
a
great
many
times
during
the
meetings
of
the
advisory
committee
babbitt
had
hinted
that
he
would
be
charmed
to
invite
eathorne
to
dinner
but
eathorne
had
murmured
so
nice
of
you
old
man
now
almost
never
go
surely
eathorne
would
not
refuse
his
own
pastor
babbitt
said
boyishly
to
drew
say
doctor
now
we
put
this
thing
over
strikes
me
it
up
to
the
dominie
to
blow
the
three
of
us
to
a
dinner
bully
you
bet
delighted
cried
drew
in
his
manliest
way
some
one
had
once
told
him
that
he
talked
like
the
late
president
roosevelt
and
uh
say
doctor
be
sure
and
get
eathorne
to
come
insist
on
it
it
uh
i
think
he
sticks
around
home
too
much
for
his
own
eathorne
came
it
was
a
friendly
dinner
babbitt
spoke
gracefully
of
the
stabilizing
and
educational
value
of
bankers
to
the
community
they
were
he
said
the
pastors
of
the
fold
of
commerce
for
the
first
time
eathorne
departed
from
the
topic
of
sunday
schools
and
asked
babbitt
about
the
progress
of
his
business
babbitt
answered
modestly
almost
filially
a
few
months
later
when
he
had
a
chance
to
take
part
in
the
street
traction
company
terminal
deal
babbitt
did
not
care
to
go
to
his
own
bank
for
a
loan
it
was
rather
a
quiet
sort
of
deal
and
if
it
had
come
out
the
public
might
not
have
understood
he
went
to
his
friend
eathorne
he
was
welcomed
and
received
the
loan
as
a
private
venture
and
they
both
profited
in
their
pleasant
new
association
after
that
babbitt
went
to
church
regularly
except
on
spring
sunday
mornings
which
were
obviously
meant
for
motoring
he
announced
to
ted
i
tell
you
boy
there
no
stronger
bulwark
of
sound
conservatism
than
the
evangelical
church
and
no
better
place
to
make
friends
help
you
to
gain
your
rightful
place
in
the
community
than
in
your
own
chapter
xviii
i
though
he
saw
them
twice
daily
though
he
knew
and
amply
discussed
every
detail
of
their
expenditures
yet
for
weeks
together
babbitt
was
no
more
conscious
of
his
children
than
of
the
buttons
on
his
the
admiration
of
kenneth
escott
made
him
aware
of
verona
she
had
become
secretary
to
gruensberg
of
the
gruensberg
leather
company
she
did
her
work
with
the
thoroughness
of
a
mind
which
reveres
details
and
never
quite
understands
them
but
she
was
one
of
the
people
who
give
an
agitating
impression
of
being
on
the
point
of
doing
something
desperate
of
leaving
a
job
or
a
husband
without
ever
doing
it
babbitt
was
so
hopeful
about
escott
hesitant
ardors
that
he
became
the
playful
parent
when
he
returned
from
the
elks
he
peered
coyly
into
the
and
gurgled
has
our
kenny
been
here
he
never
credited
verona
protest
why
ken
and
i
are
just
good
friends
and
we
only
talk
about
ideas
i
wo
have
all
this
sentimental
nonsense
that
would
spoil
it
was
ted
who
most
worried
babbitt
with
conditions
in
latin
and
english
but
with
a
triumphant
record
in
manual
training
and
the
organization
of
dances
ted
was
struggling
through
his
senior
year
in
the
east
side
high
school
at
home
he
was
interested
only
when
he
was
asked
to
trace
some
subtle
ill
in
the
ignition
system
of
the
car
he
repeated
to
his
father
that
he
did
not
wish
to
go
to
college
or
and
babbitt
was
equally
disturbed
by
this
shiftlessness
and
by
ted
relations
with
eunice
littlefield
next
door
though
she
was
the
daughter
of
howard
littlefield
that
that
priest
of
private
ownership
eunice
was
a
midge
in
the
sun
she
danced
into
the
house
she
flung
herself
into
babbitt
lap
when
he
was
reading
she
crumpled
his
paper
and
laughed
at
him
when
he
adequately
explained
that
he
hated
a
crumpled
newspaper
as
he
hated
a
broken
she
was
seventeen
now
her
ambition
was
to
be
a
cinema
actress
she
did
not
merely
attend
the
showing
of
every
feature
film
she
also
read
the
magazines
those
extraordinary
symptoms
of
the
age
of
pep
monthlies
and
weeklies
gorgeously
illustrated
with
portraits
of
young
women
who
had
recently
been
manicure
girls
not
very
skilful
manicure
girls
and
who
unless
their
every
grimace
had
been
arranged
by
a
director
could
not
have
acted
in
the
easter
cantata
of
the
central
methodist
church
magazines
reporting
quite
seriously
in
interviews
plastered
with
pictures
of
and
california
bungalows
the
views
on
sculpture
and
international
politics
of
blankly
beautiful
suspiciously
beautiful
young
men
outlining
the
plots
of
films
about
pure
prostitutes
and
and
giving
directions
for
making
bootblacks
into
celebrated
scenario
authors
overnight
these
authorities
eunice
studied
she
could
she
frequently
did
tell
whether
it
was
in
november
or
december
that
mack
harker
the
renowned
screen
cowpuncher
and
badman
began
his
public
career
as
chorus
man
in
oh
you
naughty
on
the
wall
of
her
room
her
father
reported
she
had
pinned
up
photographs
of
actors
but
the
signed
portrait
of
the
most
graceful
of
the
movie
heroes
she
carried
in
her
young
bosom
babbitt
was
bewildered
by
this
worship
of
new
gods
and
he
suspected
that
eunice
smoked
cigarettes
he
smelled
the
cloying
reek
from
and
heard
her
giggling
with
ted
he
never
inquired
the
agreeable
child
dismayed
him
her
thin
and
charming
face
was
sharpened
by
bobbed
hair
her
skirts
were
short
her
stockings
were
rolled
and
as
she
flew
after
ted
above
the
caressing
silk
were
glimpses
of
soft
knees
which
made
babbitt
uneasy
and
wretched
that
she
should
consider
him
old
sometimes
in
the
veiled
life
of
his
dreams
when
the
fairy
child
came
running
to
him
she
took
on
the
semblance
of
eunice
littlefield
ted
was
as
eunice
was
a
thousand
sarcastic
refusals
did
not
check
his
teasing
for
a
car
of
his
own
however
lax
he
might
be
about
early
rising
and
the
prosody
of
vergil
he
was
tireless
in
tinkering
with
three
other
boys
he
bought
a
rheumatic
ford
chassis
built
an
amazing
out
of
tin
and
pine
went
skidding
round
corners
in
the
perilous
craft
and
sold
it
at
a
profit
babbitt
gave
him
a
and
every
saturday
afternoon
with
seven
sandwiches
and
a
bottle
of
in
his
pockets
and
eunice
perched
eerily
on
the
rumble
seat
he
went
roaring
off
to
distant
towns
usually
eunice
and
he
were
merely
neighborhood
chums
and
quarreled
with
a
wholesome
and
violent
lack
of
delicacy
but
now
and
then
after
the
color
and
scent
of
a
dance
they
were
silent
together
and
a
little
furtive
and
babbitt
was
worried
babbitt
was
an
average
father
he
was
affectionate
bullying
opinionated
ignorant
and
rather
wistful
like
most
parents
he
enjoyed
the
game
of
waiting
till
the
victim
was
clearly
wrong
then
virtuously
pouncing
he
justified
himself
by
croaking
well
ted
mother
spoils
him
got
to
be
somebody
who
tells
him
what
what
and
me
i
elected
the
goat
because
i
try
to
bring
him
up
to
be
a
real
decent
human
being
and
not
one
of
these
sapheads
and
of
course
they
all
call
me
a
grouch
throughout
with
the
eternal
human
genius
for
arriving
by
the
worst
possible
routes
at
surprisingly
tolerable
goals
babbitt
loved
his
son
and
warmed
to
his
companionship
and
would
have
sacrificed
everything
for
him
if
he
could
have
been
sure
of
proper
credit
ii
ted
was
planning
a
party
for
his
set
in
the
senior
class
babbitt
meant
to
be
helpful
and
jolly
about
it
from
his
memory
of
pleasures
back
in
catawba
he
suggested
the
nicest
games
going
to
boston
and
charades
with
for
helmets
and
in
which
you
were
an
adjective
or
a
quality
when
he
was
most
enthusiastic
he
discovered
that
they
were
paying
attention
they
were
only
tolerating
him
as
for
the
party
it
was
as
fixed
and
standardized
as
a
union
club
hop
there
was
to
be
dancing
in
the
a
noble
collation
in
the
and
in
the
hall
two
tables
of
bridge
for
what
ted
called
the
poor
old
that
you
ca
get
to
dance
hardly
more
half
the
every
breakfast
was
monopolized
by
conferences
on
the
affair
no
one
listened
to
babbitt
bulletins
about
the
february
weather
or
to
his
comments
on
the
headlines
he
said
furiously
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
interrupt
your
engrossing
private
conversation
juh
hear
what
i
said
oh
do
be
a
spoiled
baby
ted
and
i
have
just
as
much
right
to
talk
as
you
have
flared
babbitt
on
the
night
of
the
party
he
was
permitted
to
look
on
when
he
was
not
helping
matilda
with
the
vecchia
ice
cream
and
the
petits
fours
he
was
deeply
disquieted
eight
years
ago
when
verona
had
given
a
party
the
children
had
been
featureless
gabies
now
they
were
men
and
women
of
the
world
very
supercilious
men
and
women
the
boys
condescended
to
babbitt
they
wore
and
with
hauteur
they
accepted
cigarettes
from
silver
cases
babbitt
had
heard
stories
of
what
the
athletic
club
called
goings
on
at
young
parties
of
girls
parking
their
corsets
in
the
of
cuddling
and
petting
and
a
presumable
increase
in
what
was
known
as
immorality
he
believed
the
stories
these
children
seemed
bold
to
him
and
cold
the
girls
wore
misty
chiffon
coral
velvet
or
cloth
of
gold
and
around
their
dipping
bobbed
hair
were
shining
wreaths
he
had
it
upon
urgent
and
secret
inquiry
that
no
corsets
were
known
to
be
parked
upstairs
but
certainly
these
eager
bodies
were
not
stiff
with
steel
their
stockings
were
of
lustrous
silk
their
slippers
costly
and
unnatural
their
lips
carmined
and
their
eyebrows
penciled
they
danced
cheek
to
cheek
with
the
boys
and
babbitt
sickened
with
apprehension
and
unconscious
envy
worst
of
them
all
was
eunice
littlefield
and
maddest
of
all
the
boys
was
ted
eunice
was
a
flying
demon
she
slid
the
length
of
the
room
her
tender
shoulders
swayed
her
feet
were
deft
as
a
weaver
shuttle
she
laughed
and
enticed
babbitt
to
dance
with
her
then
he
discovered
the
annex
to
the
party
the
boys
and
girls
disappeared
occasionally
and
he
remembered
rumors
of
their
drinking
together
from
flasks
he
tiptoed
round
the
house
and
in
each
of
the
dozen
cars
waiting
in
the
street
he
saw
the
points
of
light
from
cigarettes
from
each
of
them
heard
high
giggles
he
wanted
to
denounce
them
but
standing
in
the
snow
peering
round
the
dark
corner
he
did
not
dare
he
tried
to
be
tactful
when
he
had
returned
to
the
front
hall
he
coaxed
the
boys
say
if
any
of
you
fellows
are
thirsty
there
some
dandy
ginger
oh
thanks
they
condescended
he
sought
his
wife
in
the
pantry
and
exploded
i
like
to
go
in
there
and
throw
some
of
those
young
pups
out
of
the
house
they
talk
down
to
me
like
i
was
the
butler
i
like
to
i
know
she
sighed
only
everybody
says
all
the
mothers
tell
me
unless
you
stand
for
them
if
you
get
angry
because
they
go
out
to
their
cars
to
have
a
drink
they
wo
come
to
your
house
any
more
and
we
would
want
ted
left
out
of
things
would
we
he
announced
that
he
would
be
enchanted
to
have
ted
left
out
of
things
and
hurried
in
to
be
polite
lest
ted
be
left
out
of
things
but
he
resolved
if
he
found
that
the
boys
were
drinking
he
would
well
he
hand
something
that
would
surprise
while
he
was
trying
to
be
agreeable
to
young
bullies
he
was
earnestly
sniffing
at
them
twice
he
caught
the
reek
of
whisky
but
then
it
was
only
twice
howard
littlefield
lumbered
in
he
had
come
in
a
mood
of
solemn
parental
patronage
to
look
on
ted
and
eunice
were
dancing
moving
together
like
one
body
littlefield
gasped
he
called
eunice
there
was
a
whispered
duologue
and
littlefield
explained
to
babbitt
that
eunice
mother
had
a
headache
and
needed
her
she
went
off
in
tears
babbitt
looked
after
them
furiously
that
little
devil
getting
ted
into
trouble
and
littlefield
the
conceited
old
acting
like
it
was
ted
that
was
the
bad
influence
later
he
smelled
whisky
on
ted
breath
after
the
civil
farewell
to
the
guests
the
row
was
terrific
a
thorough
family
scene
like
an
avalanche
devastating
and
without
reticences
babbitt
thundered
babbitt
wept
ted
was
unconvincingly
defiant
and
verona
in
confusion
as
to
whose
side
she
was
taking
for
several
months
there
was
coolness
between
the
babbitts
and
the
littlefields
each
family
sheltering
their
lamb
from
the
next
door
babbitt
and
littlefield
still
spoke
in
pontifical
periods
about
motors
and
the
senate
but
they
kept
bleakly
away
from
mention
of
their
families
whenever
eunice
came
to
the
house
she
discussed
with
pleasant
intimacy
the
fact
that
she
had
been
forbidden
to
come
to
the
house
and
babbitt
tried
with
no
success
whatever
to
be
fatherly
and
advisory
with
her
iii
gosh
all
fishhooks
ted
wailed
to
eunice
as
they
wolfed
hot
chocolate
lumps
of
nougat
and
an
assortment
of
glace
nuts
in
the
mosaic
splendor
of
the
royal
drug
store
it
gets
me
why
dad
just
pass
out
from
being
so
poky
every
evening
he
sits
there
about
and
if
rone
or
i
say
come
on
let
do
something
he
does
even
take
the
trouble
to
think
about
it
he
just
yawns
and
says
this
suits
me
right
here
he
does
know
there
any
fun
going
on
anywhere
i
suppose
he
must
do
some
thinking
same
as
you
and
i
do
but
gosh
there
no
way
of
telling
it
i
do
believe
that
outside
of
the
office
and
playing
a
little
bum
golf
on
saturday
he
knows
anything
in
the
world
to
do
except
just
keep
sitting
there
sitting
there
every
night
not
wanting
to
go
anywhere
not
wanting
to
do
anything
thinking
us
kids
are
crazy
sitting
there
lord
iv
if
he
was
frightened
by
ted
slackness
babbitt
was
not
sufficiently
frightened
by
verona
she
was
too
safe
she
lived
too
much
in
the
neat
little
airless
room
of
her
mind
kenneth
escott
and
she
were
always
under
foot
when
they
were
not
at
home
conducting
their
cautiously
radical
courtship
over
sheets
of
statistics
they
were
trudging
off
to
lectures
by
authors
and
hindu
philosophers
and
swedish
lieutenants
gosh
babbitt
wailed
to
his
wife
as
they
walked
home
from
the
fogartys
it
gets
me
how
rone
and
that
fellow
can
be
so
poky
they
sit
there
night
after
night
whenever
he
is
working
and
they
do
know
there
any
fun
in
the
world
all
talk
and
discussion
lord
sitting
there
sitting
there
night
after
night
not
wanting
to
do
anything
thinking
i
crazy
because
i
like
to
go
out
and
play
a
fist
of
cards
sitting
there
gosh
then
round
the
swimmer
bored
by
struggling
through
the
perpetual
surf
of
family
life
new
combers
swelled
v
babbitt
and
and
henry
thompson
rented
their
old
house
in
the
bellevue
district
and
moved
to
the
hotel
hatton
that
glorified
filled
with
widows
furniture
and
the
sound
of
pitchers
they
were
lonely
there
and
every
other
sunday
evening
the
babbitts
had
to
dine
with
them
on
fricasseed
chicken
discouraged
celery
and
cornstarch
ice
cream
and
afterward
sit
polite
and
restrained
in
the
hotel
lounge
while
a
young
woman
violinist
played
songs
from
the
german
via
broadway
then
babbitt
own
mother
came
down
from
catawba
to
spend
three
weeks
she
was
a
kind
woman
and
magnificently
uncomprehending
she
congratulated
the
verona
on
being
a
nice
loyal
without
all
these
ideas
that
so
many
girls
seem
to
have
nowadays
and
when
ted
filled
the
differential
with
grease
out
of
pure
love
of
mechanics
and
filthiness
she
rejoiced
that
he
was
so
handy
around
the
house
and
helping
his
father
and
all
and
not
going
out
with
the
girls
all
the
time
and
trying
to
pretend
he
was
a
society
babbitt
loved
his
mother
and
sometimes
he
rather
liked
her
but
he
was
annoyed
by
her
christian
patience
and
he
was
reduced
to
pulpiness
when
she
discoursed
about
a
quite
mythical
hero
called
your
father
you
wo
remember
it
georgie
you
were
such
a
little
fellow
at
the
time
my
i
remember
just
how
you
looked
that
day
with
your
goldy
brown
curls
and
your
lace
collar
you
always
were
such
a
dainty
child
and
kind
of
puny
and
sickly
and
you
loved
pretty
things
so
much
and
the
red
tassels
on
your
little
bootees
and
all
and
your
father
was
taking
us
to
church
and
a
man
stopped
us
and
said
so
many
of
the
neighbors
used
to
call
your
father
of
course
he
was
only
a
private
in
the
war
but
everybody
knew
that
was
because
of
the
jealousy
of
his
captain
and
he
ought
to
have
been
a
officer
he
had
that
natural
ability
to
command
that
so
very
very
few
men
have
and
this
man
came
out
into
the
road
and
held
up
his
hand
and
stopped
the
buggy
and
said
he
said
a
lot
of
the
folks
around
here
that
have
decided
to
support
colonel
scanell
for
congress
and
we
want
you
to
join
us
meeting
people
the
way
you
do
in
the
store
you
could
help
us
a
lot
well
your
father
just
looked
at
him
and
said
certainly
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
do
like
his
politics
he
said
well
the
man
captain
smith
they
used
to
call
him
and
heaven
only
knows
why
because
he
had
the
shadow
or
vestige
of
a
right
to
be
called
or
any
other
title
this
captain
smith
said
make
it
hot
for
you
if
you
do
stick
by
your
friends
major
well
you
know
how
your
father
was
and
this
smith
knew
it
too
he
knew
what
a
real
man
he
was
and
he
knew
your
father
knew
the
political
situation
from
a
to
z
and
he
ought
to
have
seen
that
here
was
one
man
he
could
impose
on
but
he
went
on
trying
to
and
hinting
and
trying
till
your
father
spoke
up
and
said
to
him
smith
he
said
have
a
reputation
around
these
parts
for
being
one
who
is
amply
qualified
to
mind
his
own
business
and
let
other
folks
mind
theirs
and
with
that
he
drove
on
and
left
the
fellow
standing
there
in
the
road
like
a
bump
on
a
log
babbitt
was
most
exasperated
when
she
revealed
his
boyhood
to
the
children
he
had
it
seemed
been
fond
of
had
worn
the
loveliest
little
pink
bow
in
his
curls
and
corrupted
his
own
name
to
he
heard
though
he
did
not
officially
hear
ted
admonishing
tinka
come
on
now
kid
stick
the
lovely
pink
bow
in
your
curls
and
beat
it
down
to
breakfast
or
will
jaw
your
head
babbitt
martin
with
his
wife
and
youngest
baby
came
down
from
catawba
for
two
days
martin
bred
cattle
and
ran
the
dusty
he
was
proud
of
being
a
freeborn
independent
american
of
the
good
old
yankee
stock
he
was
proud
of
being
honest
blunt
ugly
and
disagreeable
his
favorite
remark
was
how
much
did
you
pay
for
that
he
regarded
verona
books
babbitt
silver
pencil
and
flowers
on
the
table
as
citified
extravagances
and
said
so
babbitt
would
have
quarreled
with
him
but
for
his
gawky
wife
and
the
baby
whom
babbitt
teased
and
poked
fingers
at
and
addressed
i
think
this
baby
a
bum
yes
sir
i
think
this
little
baby
a
bum
he
a
bum
yes
sir
he
a
bum
that
what
he
is
he
a
bum
this
baby
a
bum
he
nothing
but
an
old
bum
that
what
he
is
a
bum
all
the
while
verona
and
kenneth
escott
held
long
inquiries
into
epistemology
ted
was
a
disgraced
rebel
and
tinka
aged
eleven
was
demanding
that
she
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
movies
thrice
a
week
like
all
the
babbitt

and
not
a

one
of
grateful
no

and
no

and
no

from
anybody
and
to
keep
it
up
for
good
lord
how
long
he
enjoyed
being
sick
in
february
he
was
delighted
by
their
consternation
that
he
the
rock
should
give
way
he
had
eaten
a
questionable
clam
for
two
days
he
was
languorous
and
petted
and
esteemed
he
was
allowed
to
snarl
oh
let
me
alone
without
reprisals
he
lay
on
the
and
watched
the
winter
sun
slide
along
the
taut
curtains
turning
their
ruddy
khaki
to
pale
blood
red
the
shadow
of
the
was
dense
black
in
an
enticing
ripple
on
the
canvas
he
found
pleasure
in
the
curve
of
it
sighed
as
the
fading
light
blurred
it
he
was
conscious
of
life
and
a
little
sad
with
no
vergil
gunches
before
whom
to
set
his
face
in
resolute
optimism
he
beheld
and
half
admitted
that
he
beheld
his
way
of
life
as
incredibly
mechanical
mechanical
business
a
brisk
selling
of
badly
built
houses
mechanical
religion
a
dry
hard
church
shut
off
from
the
real
life
of
the
streets
inhumanly
respectable
as
a
mechanical
golf
and
and
bridge
and
conversation
save
with
paul
riesling
mechanical
friendships
and
jocular
never
daring
to
essay
the
test
of
quietness
he
turned
uneasily
in
bed
he
saw
the
years
the
brilliant
winter
days
and
all
the
long
sweet
afternoons
which
were
meant
for
summery
meadows
lost
in
such
brittle
pretentiousness
he
thought
of
telephoning
about
leases
of
cajoling
men
he
hated
of
making
business
calls
and
waiting
in
dirty
anterooms
hat
on
knee
yawning
at
calendars
being
polite
to
i
do
hardly
want
to

of

temper
chapter

i
the
zenith
street
traction
company
planned
to
build
shops
in
the
suburb
of
dorchester
but
when
they
came
to
buy
the
land
they
found
it
held
on
options
by
the
realty
company
the
the
first
and
even
the
president
of
the
traction
company
protested
against
the
babbitt
price
they
mentioned
their
duty
toward
stockholders
they
threatened
an
appeal
to
the
courts
though
somehow
the
appeal
to
the
courts
was
never
carried
out
and
the
officials
found
it
wiser
to
compromise
with
babbitt
carbon
copies
of
the
correspondence
are
in
the
company
files
where
they
may
be
viewed
by
any
public
commission
just
after
this
babbitt
deposited
three
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
the
of
the
street
traction
company
bought
a
five
thousand
dollar
car
the
first
built
a
home
in

and
the
president
was
appointed
minister
to
a
foreign
country
to
obtain
the
options
to
tie
up
one
man
land
without
letting
his
neighbor
know
had
been
an
unusual
strain
on
babbitt
it
was
necessary
to
introduce
rumors
about
planning
garages
and
stores
to
pretend
that
he
was
taking
any
more
options
to
wait
and
look
as
bored
as
a
at
a
time
when
the
failure
to
secure
a
threatened
his
whole
plan
to
all
this
was
added
a
quarrel
with
his
secret
associates
in
the
deal
they
did
not
wish
babbitt
and
thompson
to
have
any
share
in
the
deal
except
as
brokers
babbitt
rather
agreed
ethics
of
the
ought
to
strictly
represent
his
principles
and
not
get
in
on
the
buying
he
said
to
thompson
ethics
rats
think
i
going
to
see
that
bunch
of
holy
grafters
get
away
with
the
swag
and
us
not
climb
in
snorted
old
henry
well
i
do
like
to
do
it
kind
of
it
ai
it
it
the
public
that
gets
well
now
we
been
ethical
and
got
it
out
of
our
systems
the
question
is
where
we
can
raise
a
loan
to
handle
some
of
the
property
for
ourselves
on
the
we
ca
go
to
our
bank
for
it
might
come
i
could
see
old
eathorne
he
close
as
the
that
the
eathorne
was
glad
he
said
to
invest
in
character
to
make
babbitt
the
loan
and
see
to
it
that
the
loan
did
not
appear
on
the
books
of
the
bank
thus
certain
of
the
options
which
babbitt
and
thompson
obtained
were
on
parcels
of
real
estate
which
they
themselves
owned
though
the
property
did
not
appear
in
their
names
in
the
midst
of
closing
this
splendid
deal
which
stimulated
business
and
public
confidence
by
giving
an
example
of
increased
activity
babbitt
was
overwhelmed
to
find
that
he
had
a
dishonest
person
working
for
him
the
dishonest
one
was
stanley
graff
the
outside
salesman
for
some
time
babbitt
had
been
worried
about
graff
he
did
not
keep
his
word
to
tenants
in
order
to
rent
a
house
he
would
promise
repairs
which
the
owner
had
not
authorized
it
was
suspected
that
he
juggled
inventories
of
furnished
houses
so
that
when
the
tenant
left
he
had
to
pay
for
articles
which
had
never
been
in
the
house
and
the
price
of
which
graff
put
into
his
pocket
babbitt
had
not
been
able
to
prove
these
suspicions
and
though
he
had
rather
planned
to
discharge
graff
he
had
never
quite
found
time
for
it
now
into
babbitt
private
room
charged
a
man
panting
look
here
i
come
to
raise
particular
merry
hell
and
unless
you
have
that
fellow
pinched
i
will
what
calm
down
o
man
what
trouble
trouble
huh
here
the
trouble
sit
down
and
take
it
easy
they
can
hear
you
all
over
the
building
this
fellow
graff
you
got
working
for
you
he
leases
me
a
house
i
was
in
yesterday
and
signs
the
lease
all
and
he
was
to
get
the
owner
signature
and
mail
me
the
lease
last
night
well
and
he
did
this
morning
i
comes
down
to
breakfast
and
the
girl
says
a
fellow
had
come
to
the
house
right
after
the
early
delivery
and
told
her
he
wanted
an
envelope
that
had
been
mailed
by
mistake
big
long
envelope
with
in
the
corner
of
it
sure
enough
there
it
was
so
she
lets
him
have
it
and
she
describes
the
fellow
to
me
and
it
was
this
graff
so
i
to
him
and
he
the
poor
fool
he
admits
it
he
says
after
my
lease
was
all
signed
he
got
a
better
offer
from
another
fellow
and
he
wanted
my
lease
back
now
what
you
going
to
do
about
it
your
name
is
william
varney
oh
yes
that
was
the
garrison
babbitt
sounded
the
buzzer
when
miss
mcgoun
came
in
he
demanded
graff
gone
out
yes
will
you
look
through
his
desk
and
see
if
there
is
a
lease
made
out
to
varney
on
the
garrison
house
to
varney
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
this
happened
needless
to
say
i
fire
graff
the
minute
he
comes
in
and
of
course
your
lease
stands
but
there
one
other
thing
like
to
do
i
tell
the
owner
not
to
pay
us
the
commission
but
apply
it
to
your
rent
no
straight
i
want
to
to
be
frank
this
thing
shakes
me
up
bad
i
suppose
i
always
been
a
practical
business
man
probably
i
told
one
or
two
fairy
stories
in
my
time
when
the
occasion
called
for
it
you
know
sometimes
you
have
to
lay
things
on
thick
to
impress
boneheads
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
had
to
accuse
one
of
my
own
employees
of
anything
more
dishonest
than
pinching
a
few
stamps
honest
it
would
hurt
me
if
we
profited
by
it
so
you
let
me
hand
you
the
commission
good
ii
he
walked
through
the
february
city
where
trucks
flung
up
a
spattering
of
slush
and
the
sky
was
dark
above
dark
brick
cornices
he
came
back
miserable
he
who
respected
the
law
had
broken
it
by
concealing
the
federal
crime
of
interception
of
the
mails
but
he
could
not
see
graff
go
to
jail
and
his
wife
suffer
worse
he
had
to
discharge
graff
and
this
was
a
part
of
office
routine
which
he
feared
he
liked
people
so
much
he
so
much
wanted
them
to
like
him
that
he
could
not
bear
insulting
them
miss
mcgoun
dashed
in
to
whisper
with
the
excitement
of
an
approaching
scene
he
here
mr
graff
ask
him
to
come
he
tried
to
make
himself
heavy
and
calm
in
his
chair
and
to
keep
his
eyes
expressionless
graff
stalked
in
a
man
of
dapper
with
a
foppish
mustache
want
me
said
graff
yes
sit
graff
continued
to
stand
grunting
i
suppose
that
old
nut
varney
has
been
in
to
see
you
let
me
explain
about
him
he
a
regular
tightwad
and
he
sticks
out
for
every
cent
and
he
practically
lied
to
me
about
his
ability
to
pay
the
rent
i
found
that
out
just
after
we
signed
up
and
then
another
fellow
comes
along
with
a
better
offer
for
the
house
and
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
the
firm
to
get
rid
of
varney
and
i
was
so
worried
about
it
i
skun
up
there
and
got
back
the
lease
honest
babbitt
i
did
intend
to
pull
anything
crooked
i
just
wanted
the
firm
to
have
all
the
commis
wait
now
stan
this
may
all
be
true
but
i
been
having
a
lot
of
complaints
about
you
now
i
do
you
ever
mean
to
do
wrong
and
i
think
if
you
just
get
a
good
lesson
that
jog
you
up
a
little
you
turn
out
a
realtor
yet
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
keep
you
graff
leaned
against
the
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
laughed
so
i
fired
well
old
vision
and
ethics
i
tickled
to
death
but
i
do
want
you
to
think
you
can
get
away
with
any
stuff
sure
i
pulled
some
raw
stuff
a
little
of
it
but
how
could
i
help
it
in
this
office
now
by
god
young
man
tut
tut
keep
the
naughty
temper
down
and
do
holler
because
everybody
in
the
outside
office
will
hear
you
they
probably
listening
right
now
babbitt
old
dear
you
crooked
in
the
first
place
and
a
damn
skinflint
in
the
second
if
you
paid
me
a
decent
salary
i
would
have
to
steal
pennies
off
a
blind
man
to
keep
my
wife
from
starving
us
married
just
five
months
and
her
the
nicest
girl
living
and
you
keeping
us
flat
broke
all
the
time
you
damned
old
thief
so
you
can
put
money
away
for
your
saphead
of
a
son
and
your
wishywashy
fool
of
a
daughter
wait
now
you
by
god
take
it
or
i
bellow
so
the
whole
office
will
hear
it
and
crooked
say
if
i
told
the
prosecuting
attorney
what
i
know
about
this
last
street
traction
option
steal
both
you
and
me
would
go
to
jail
along
with
some
nice
clean
pious
traction
guns
well
stan
looks
like
we
were
coming
down
to
cases
that
deal
there
was
nothing
crooked
about
it
the
only
way
you
can
get
progress
is
for
the
men
to
get
things
done
and
they
got
to
be
rewarded
oh
for
pete
sake
do
get
virtuous
on
me
as
i
gather
it
fired
all
right
it
a
good
thing
for
me
and
if
i
catch
you
knocking
me
to
any
other
firm
i
squeal
all
i
know
about
you
and
henry
and
the
dirty
little
lickspittle
deals
that
you
corporals
of
industry
pull
off
for
the
bigger
and
brainier
crooks
and
you
get
chased
out
of
town
and
me
you
right
babbitt
i
been
going
crooked
but
now
i
going
straight
and
the
first
step
will
be
to
get
a
job
in
some
office
where
the
boss
does
talk
about
ideals
bad
luck
old
dear
and
you
can
stick
your
job
up
the
sewer
babbitt
sat
for
a
long
time
alternately
raging
i
have
him
arrested
and
yearning
i
wonder
no
i
never
done
anything
that
was
necessary
to
keep
the
wheels
of
progress
next
day
he
hired
in
graff
place
fritz
weilinger
the
salesman
of
his
most
injurious
rival
the
east
side
homes
and
development
company
and
thus
at
once
annoyed
his
competitor
and
acquired
an
excellent
man
young
fritz
was
a
merry
youngster
he
made
customers
welcome
to
the
office
babbitt
thought
of
him
as
a
son
and
in
him
had
much
comfort
iii
an
abandoned
on
the
outskirts
of
chicago
a
plot
excellent
for
factory
sites
was
to
be
sold
and
jake
offut
asked
babbitt
to
bid
on
it
for
him
the
strain
of
the
street
traction
deal
and
his
disappointment
in
stanley
graff
had
so
shaken
babbitt
that
he
found
it
hard
to
sit
at
his
desk
and
concentrate
he
proposed
to
his
family
look
here
folks
do
you
know
who
going
to
trot
up
to
chicago
for
a
couple
of
days
just
wo
lose
but
one
day
of
school
know
who
going
with
that
celebrated
george
babbitt
why
theodore
roosevelt
babbitt
hurray
ted
shouted
and
oh
maybe
the
babbitt
men
wo
paint
that
lil
ole
town
red
and
once
away
from
the
familiar
implications
of
home
they
were
two
men
together
ted
was
young
only
in
his
assumption
of
oldness
and
the
only
realms
apparently
in
which
babbitt
had
a
larger
and
more
knowledge
than
ted
were
the
details
of
real
estate
and
the
phrases
of
politics
when
the
other
sages
of
the
pullman
had
left
them
to
themselves
babbitt
voice
did
not
drop
into
the
playful
and
otherwise
offensive
tone
in
which
one
addresses
children
but
continued
its
overwhelming
and
monotonous
rumble
and
ted
tried
to
imitate
it
in
his
strident
tenor
gee
dad
you
certainly
did
show
up
that
poor
boot
when
he
got
flip
about
the
league
of
nations
well
the
trouble
with
a
lot
of
these
fellows
is
they
simply
know
what
they
talking
about
they
do
get
down
to
facts
what
do
you
think
of
ken
escott
i
tell
you
dad
it
strikes
me
ken
is
a
nice
lad
no
special
faults
except
he
smokes
too
much
but
slow
lord
why
if
we
do
give
him
a
shove
the
poor
never
will
propose
and
rone
just
as
bad
yes
i
guess
you
right
they
slow
they
have
either
one
of
got
our
that
right
they
slow
i
swear
dad
i
do
know
how
rone
got
into
our
family
i
bet
if
the
truth
were
known
you
were
a
bad
old
egg
when
you
were
a
kid
well
i
was
so
slow
i
bet
you
were
i
bet
you
did
miss
many
tricks
well
when
i
was
out
with
the
girls
i
did
spend
all
the
time
telling
about
the
strike
in
the
knitting
industry
they
roared
together
and
together
lighted
cigars
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
babbitt
consulted
gosh
i
do
know
i
swear
sometimes
i
feel
like
taking
ken
aside
and
putting
him
over
the
jumps
and
saying
to
him
fella
me
lad
are
you
going
to
marry
young
rone
or
are
you
going
to
talk
her
to
death
here
you
are
getting
on
toward
thirty
and
you
only
making
twenty
or
a
week
when
you
going
to
develop
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
get
a
raise
if
there
anything
that
george
or
i
can
do
to
help
you
call
on
us
but
show
a
little
speed
anyway
well
at
that
it
might
not
be
so
bad
if
you
or
i
talked
to
him
except
he
might
not
understand
he
one
of
these
high
brows
he
ca
come
down
to
cases
and
lay
his
cards
on
the
table
and
talk
straight
out
from
the
shoulder
like
you
or
i
that
right
he
like
all
these
that
so
like
all
of
that
a
they
sighed
and
were
silent
and
thoughtful
and
happy
the
conductor
came
in
he
had
once
called
at
babbitt
office
to
ask
about
houses
h
are
you
babbitt
we
going
to
have
you
with
us
to
chicago
this
your
boy
yes
this
is
my
son
well
now
what
do
you
know
about
that
here
i
been
thinking
you
were
a
youngster
yourself
not
a
day
over
forty
hardly
and
you
with
this
great
big
fellow
forty
why
brother
i
never
see
again
is
that
a
fact
would
hardly
thought
it
yes
sir
it
a
bad
for
the
old
man
when
he
has
to
travel
with
a
young
whale
like
ted
here
you
right
it
to
ted
i
suppose
you
in
college
now
proudly
no
not
till
next
fall
i
just
kind
of
giving
the
colleges
the
as
the
conductor
went
on
his
affable
way
huge
jingling
against
his
blue
chest
babbitt
and
ted
gravely
considered
colleges
they
arrived
at
chicago
late
at
night
they
lay
abed
in
the
morning
rejoicing
pretty
nice
not
to
have
to
get
up
and
get
down
to
breakfast
heh
they
were
staying
at
the
modest
eden
hotel
because
zenith
business
men
always
stayed
at
the
eden
but
they
had
dinner
in
the
brocade
and
crystal
versailles
room
of
the
regency
hotel
babbitt
ordered
blue
point
oysters
with
cocktail
sauce
a
tremendous
steak
with
a
tremendous
platter
of
french
fried
potatoes
two
pots
of
coffee
apple
pie
with
ice
cream
for
both
of
them
and
for
ted
an
extra
piece
of
mince
pie
hot
stuff
some
feed
young
fella
ted
admired
huh
you
stick
around
with
me
old
man
and
i
show
you
a
good
time
they
went
to
a
musical
comedy
and
nudged
each
other
at
the
matrimonial
jokes
and
the
prohibition
jokes
they
paraded
the
lobby
arm
in
arm
between
acts
and
in
the
glee
of
his
first
release
from
the
shame
which
dissevers
fathers
and
sons
ted
chuckled
dad
did
you
ever
hear
the
one
about
the
three
milliners
and
the
judge
when
ted
had
returned
to
zenith
babbitt
was
lonely
as
he
was
trying
to
make
alliance
between
offutt
and
certain
milwaukee
interests
which
wanted
the
plot
most
of
his
time
was
taken
up
in
waiting
for
telephone
calls
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
holding
the
portable
telephone
asking
wearily
mr
sagen
not
in
yet
didn
he
leave
any
message
for
me
all
right
i
hold
the
staring
at
a
stain
on
the
wall
reflecting
that
it
resembled
a
shoe
and
being
bored
by
this
twentieth
discovery
that
it
resembled
a
shoe
lighting
a
cigarette
then
bound
to
the
telephone
with
no
ashtray
in
reach
wondering
what
to
do
with
this
burning
menace
and
anxiously
trying
to
toss
it
into
the
tiled
bathroom
at
last
on
the
telephone
no
message
eh
all
right
i
call
up
one
afternoon
he
wandered
through
streets
of
which
he
had
never
heard
streets
of
small
tenements
and
houses
and
marooned
cottages
it
came
to
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
that
there
was
nothing
he
wanted
to
do
he
was
bleakly
lonely
in
the
evening
when
he
dined
by
himself
at
the
regency
hotel
he
sat
in
the
lobby
afterward
in
a
plush
chair
bedecked
with
the
arms
lighting
a
cigar
and
looking
for
some
one
who
would
come
and
play
with
him
and
save
him
from
thinking
in
the
chair
next
to
him
showing
the
arms
of
lithuania
was
a
man
a
large
man
with
pop
eyes
and
a
deficient
yellow
mustache
he
seemed
kind
and
insignificant
and
as
lonely
as
babbitt
himself
he
wore
a
tweed
suit
and
a
reluctant
orange
tie
it
came
to
babbitt
with
a
pyrotechnic
crash
the
melancholy
stranger
was
sir
gerald
doak
instinctively
babbitt
rose
bumbling
how
you
sir
gerald
we
met
in
zenith
at
charley
mckelvey
babbitt
my
name
real
oh
how
d
you
sir
gerald
shook
hands
flabbily
embarrassed
standing
wondering
how
he
could
retreat
babbitt
maundered
well
i
suppose
you
been
having
a
great
trip
since
we
saw
you
in
quite
british
columbia
and
california
and
all
over
the
place
he
said
doubtfully
looking
at
babbitt
lifelessly
how
did
you
find
business
conditions
in
british
columbia
or
i
suppose
maybe
you
did
look
into
scenery
and
sport
and
so
on
scenery
oh
capital
but
business
conditions
you
know
babbitt
they
having
almost
as
much
unemployment
as
we
sir
gerald
was
speaking
warmly
now
so
business
conditions
not
so
doggone
good
eh
no
business
conditions
were
at
all
what
i
hoped
to
find
not
good
eh
no
not
not
really
that
a
darn
shame
well
i
suppose
you
waiting
for
somebody
to
take
you
out
to
some
big
shindig
sir
shindig
oh
shindig
no
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
wondering
what
the
deuce
i
could
do
this
evening
do
know
a
soul
in
tchicahgo
i
wonder
if
you
happen
to
know
whether
there
a
good
theater
in
this
city
good
why
say
they
running
grand
opera
right
now
i
guess
maybe
you
like
eh
eh
went
to
the
opera
once
in
london
covent
garden
sort
of
thing
shocking
no
i
was
wondering
if
there
was
a
good
babbitt
was
sitting
down
hitching
his
chair
over
shouting
movie
say
sir
gerald
i
supposed
of
course
you
had
a
raft
of
dames
waiting
to
lead
you
out
to
some
soiree
god
forbid
but
if
you
have
what
do
you
say
you
and
me
go
to
a
movie
a
peach
of
a
film
at
the
grantham
bill
hart
in
a
bandit
just
a
moment
while
i
get
my
swollen
with
greatness
slightly
afraid
lest
the
noble
blood
of
nottingham
change
its
mind
and
leave
him
at
any
street
corner
babbitt
paraded
with
sir
gerald
doak
to
the
movie
palace
and
in
silent
bliss
sat
beside
him
trying
not
to
be
too
enthusiastic
lest
the
knight
despise
his
adoration
of
and
broncos
at
the
end
sir
gerald
murmured
jolly
good
picture
this
so
awfully
decent
of
you
to
take
me
have
enjoyed
myself
so
much
for
weeks
all
these
hostesses
they
never
let
you
go
to
the
cinema
the
devil
you
say
babbitt
speech
had
lost
the
delicate
refinement
and
all
the
broad
a
with
which
he
had
adorned
it
and
become
hearty
and
natural
well
i
tickled
to
death
you
liked
it
sir
they
crawled
past
the
knees
of
fat
women
into
the
aisle
they
stood
in
the
lobby
waving
their
arms
in
the
rite
of
putting
on
overcoats
babbitt
hinted
say
how
about
a
little
something
to
eat
i
know
a
place
where
we
could
get
a
swell
rarebit
and
we
might
dig
up
a
little
drink
that
is
if
you
ever
touch
the
rather
but
why
do
you
come
to
my
room
i
some
scotch
not
half
oh
i
do
want
to
use
up
all
your
hootch
it
darn
nice
of
you
but
you
probably
want
to
hit
the
sir
gerald
was
transformed
he
was
beefily
yearning
oh
really
now
i
have
had
a
decent
evening
for
so
long
having
to
go
to
all
these
dances
no
chance
to
discuss
business
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
be
a
good
chap
and
come
along
wo
you
will
i
you
bet
i
just
thought
maybe
say
by
golly
it
does
do
a
fellow
good
do
it
to
sit
and
visit
about
business
conditions
after
he
been
to
these
balls
and
masquerades
and
banquets
and
all
that
society
stuff
i
often
feel
that
way
in
zenith
sure
you
bet
that
awfully
nice
of
they
beamed
along
the
street
look
here
old
chap
can
you
tell
me
do
american
cities
always
keep
up
this
dreadful
social
pace
all
these
magnificent
parties
go
on
now
quit
your
kidding
gosh
you
with
court
balls
and
functions
and
everything
no
really
old
chap
mother
and
i
lady
doak
i
should
say
we
usually
play
a
hand
of
bezique
and
go
to
bed
at
ten
bless
my
soul
i
keep
up
your
beastly
pace
and
talking
all
your
american
women
they
know
so
much
culture
and
that
sort
of
thing
this
mckelvey
your
friend
yuh
old
lucile
good
she
asked
me
which
of
the
galleries
i
liked
best
in
florence
or
was
it
in
firenze
never
been
in
italy
in
my
life
and
primitives
did
i
like
primitives
do
you
know
what
the
deuce
a
primitive
is
me
i
should
say
not
but
i
know
what
a
discount
for
cash
rather
so
do
i
by
george
but
primitives
yuh
primitives
they
laughed
with
the
sound
of
a
boosters
luncheon
sir
gerald
room
was
except
for
his
ponderous
and
durable
english
bags
very
much
like
the
room
of
george
babbitt
and
quite
in
the
manner
of
babbitt
he
disclosed
a
huge
whisky
flask
looked
proud
and
hospitable
and
chuckled
say
when
old
it
was
after
the
third
drink
that
sir
gerald
proclaimed
how
do
you
yankees
get
the
notion
that
writing
chaps
like
bertrand
shaw
and
this
wells
represent
us
the
real
business
england
we
think
those
chaps
are
traitors
both
our
countries
have
their
comic
old
aristocracy
you
know
old
county
families
hunting
people
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
we
both
have
our
wretched
labor
leaders
but
we
both
have
a
backbone
of
sound
business
men
who
run
the
whole
you
bet
here
to
the
real
guys
i
with
you
here
to
ourselves
it
was
after
the
fourth
drink
that
sir
gerald
asked
humbly
what
do
you
think
of
north
dakota
mortgages
but
it
was
not
till
after
the
fifth
that
babbitt
began
to
call
him
jerry
and
sir
gerald
confided
i
say
do
you
mind
if
i
pull
off
my
boots
and
ecstatically
stretched
his
knightly
feet
his
poor
tired
hot
swollen
feet
out
on
the
bed
after
the
sixth
babbitt
irregularly
arose
well
i
better
be
hiking
along
jerry
you
a
regular
human
being
i
wish
to
thunder
we
been
better
acquainted
in
zenith
lookit

while

have
let
them
give
me
the
beastly
title
and
i
did
get
it
for
nothing
eh
if
i
thought
have
to
talk
to
women
about
primitives
and
polo
goodish
thing
to
have
in
nottingham
though
annoyed
the
mayor
most
frightfully
when
i
got
it
and
of
course
the
missus
likes
it
but
nobody
calls
me
now
he
was
almost
weeping
and
nobody
in
the
states
has
treated
me
like
a
friend
till
old
chap
thanks
awfully
do
mention
it
jerry
and
remember
whenever
you
get
to
zenith
the
is
always
and
do
forget
old
boy
if
you
ever
come
to
nottingham
mother
and
i
will
be
frightfully
glad
to
see
you
i
shall
tell
the
fellows
in
nottingham
your
ideas
about
visions
and
real
guys
at
our
next
rotary
club
iv
babbitt
lay
abed
at
his
hotel
imagining
the
zenith
athletic
club
asking
him
what
kind
of
a
time
have
in
chicago
and
his
answering
oh
fair
ran
around
with
sir
gerald
doak
a
lot
picturing
himself
meeting
lucile
mckelvey
and
admonishing
her
you
all
right
mac
when
you
are
trying
to
pull
this
highbrow
pose
it
just
as
gerald
doak
says
to
me
in
chicago
oh
yes
jerry
an
old
friend
of
mine
the
wife
and
i
are
thinking
of
running
over
to
england
to
stay
with
jerry
in
his
castle
next
year
and
he
said
to
me
old
bean
i
like
lucile
but
you
and
me
george
we
got
to
make
her
get
over
this
hooptediddle
way
she
but
that
evening
a
thing
happened
which
wrecked
his
pride
v
at
the
regency
hotel
he
fell
to
talking
with
a
salesman
of
pianos
and
they
dined
together
babbitt
was
filled
with
friendliness
and
he
enjoyed
the
gorgeousness
of
the
the
chandeliers
the
looped
brocade
curtains
the
portraits
of
french
kings
against
panels
of
gilded
oak
he
enjoyed
the
crowd
pretty
women
good
solid
fellows
who
were
liberal
he
gasped
he
stared
and
turned
away
and
stared
again
three
tables
off
with
a
doubtful
sort
of
woman
a
woman
at
once
coy
and
withered
was
paul
riesling
and
paul
was
supposed
to
be
in
akron
selling
the
woman
was
tapping
his
hand
mooning
at
him
and
giggling
babbitt
felt
that
he
had
encountered
something
involved
and
harmful
paul
was
talking
with
the
rapt
eagerness
of
a
man
who
is
telling
his
troubles
he
was
concentrated
on
the
woman
faded
eyes
once
he
held
her
hand
and
once
blind
to
the
other
guests
he
puckered
his
lips
as
though
he
was
pretending
to
kiss
her
babbitt
had
so
strong
an
impulse
to
go
to
paul
that
he
could
feel
his
body
uncoiling
his
shoulders
moving
but
he
felt
desperately
that
he
must
be
diplomatic
and
not
till
he
saw
paul
paying
the
check
did
he
bluster
to
the
by
golly
friend
of
mine
over
there
me
second
just
say
hello
to
he
touched
paul
shoulder
and
cried
well
when
did
you
hit
town
paul
glared
up
at
him
face
hardening
oh
hello
george
thought
gone
back
to
he
did
not
introduce
his
companion
babbitt
peeped
at
her
she
was
a
flabbily
pretty
weakly
flirtatious
woman
of
or
three
in
an
atrocious
flowery
hat
her
rouging
was
thorough
but
unskilful
where
you
staying
paulibus
the
woman
turned
yawned
examined
her
nails
she
seemed
accustomed
to
not
being
introduced
paul
grumbled
campbell
inn
on
the
south
alone
it
sounded
insinuating
yes
unfortunately
furiously
paul
turned
toward
the
woman
smiling
with
a
fondness
sickening
to
babbitt
may
want
to
introduce
you
arnold
this
is
my
george
pleasmeech
growled
babbitt
while
she
gurgled
oh
i
very
pleased
to
meet
any
friend
of
riesling
i
babbitt
demanded
be
back
there
later
this
evening
paul
i
drop
down
and
see
no
better
we
better
lunch
together
all
right
but
i
see
you
too
paul
i
go
down
to
your
hotel
and
i
wait
for
you
chapter
xx
i
he
sat
smoking
with
the
clinging
to
the
warm
refuge
of
gossip
afraid
to
venture
into
thoughts
of
paul
he
was
the
more
affable
on
the
surface
as
secretly
he
became
more
apprehensive
felt
more
hollow
he
was
certain
that
paul
was
in
chicago
without
knowledge
and
that
he
was
doing
things
not
at
all
moral
and
secure
when
the
salesman
yawned
that
he
had
to
write
up
his
orders
babbitt
left
him
left
the
hotel
in
leisurely
calm
but
savagely
he
said
campbell
inn
to
the
he
sat
agitated
on
the
slippery
leather
seat
in
that
chill
dimness
which
smelled
of
dust
and
perfume
and
turkish
cigarettes
he
did
not
heed
the
snowy
the
dark
spaces
and
sudden
bright
corners
in
the
unknown
land
south
of
the
loop
the
office
of
the
campbell
inn
was
hard
bright
new
the
night
clerk
harder
and
brighter
yep
he
said
to
babbitt
mr
paul
riesling
registered
here
is
he
in
now
then
if
you
give
me
his
key
i
wait
for
ca
do
that
brother
wait
down
here
if
you
babbitt
had
spoken
with
the
deference
which
all
the
clan
of
good
fellows
give
to
hotel
clerks
now
he
said
with
snarling
abruptness
i
may
have
to
wait
some
time
i
riesling
i
go
up
to
his
room
d
i
look
like
a
his
voice
was
low
and
not
pleasant
with
considerable
haste
the
clerk
took
down
the
key
protesting
i
never
said
you
looked
like
a
just
rules
of
the
hotel
but
if
you
want
to
on
his
way
up
in
the
elevator
babbitt
wondered
why
he
was
here
why
should
paul
be
dining
with
a
respectable
married
woman
why
had
he
lied
to
the
clerk
about
being
paul
he
had
acted
like
a
child
he
must
be
careful
not
to
say
foolish
dramatic
things
to
paul
as
he
settled
down
he
tried
to
look
pompous
and
placid
then
the
thought
suicide
he
been
dreading
that
without
knowing
it
paul
would
be
just
the
person
to
do
something
like
that
he
must
be
out
of
his
head
or
he
would
be
confiding
in
that
that
hag
zilla
oh
damn
zilla
how
gladly
he
throttle
that
nagging
fiend
of
a
woman
she
probably
succeeded
at
last
and
driven
paul
crazy
suicide
out
there
in
the
lake
way
out
beyond
the
piled
ice
along
the
shore
it
would
be
ghastly
cold
to
drop
into
the
water
or
throat
cut
in
the
bathroom
babbitt
flung
into
paul
bathroom
it
was
empty
he
smiled
feebly
he
pulled
at
his
choking
collar
looked
at
his
watch
opened
the
window
to
stare
down
at
the
street
looked
at
his
watch
tried
to
read
the
evening
paper
lying
on
the
bureau
looked
again
at
his
watch
three
minutes
had
gone
by
since
he
had
first
looked
at
it
and
he
waited
for
three
hours
he
was
sitting
fixed
chilled
when
the
doorknob
turned
paul
came
in
glowering
hello
paul
said
been
waiting
yuh
little
well
well
what
just
thought
i
drop
in
to
see
how
you
made
out
in
i
did
all
right
what
difference
does
it
make
why
gosh
paul
what
are
you
sore
about
what
are
you
butting
into
my
affairs
for
why
paul
that
no
way
to
talk
i
not
butting
into
nothing
i
was
so
glad
to
see
your
ugly
old
phiz
that
i
just
dropped
in
to
say
well
i
not
going
to
have
anybody
following
me
around
and
trying
to
boss
me
i
had
all
of
that
i
going
to
stand
well
gosh
i
not
i
did
like
the
way
you
looked
at
may
arnold
or
the
snooty
way
you
well
all
right
then
if
you
think
i
a
buttinsky
then
i
just
butt
in
i
do
know
who
your
may
arnold
is
but
i
know
doggone
good
and
well
that
you
and
her
were
talking
about
no
nor
about
playing
the
violin
neither
if
you
have
got
any
moral
consideration
for
yourself
you
ought
to
have
some
for
your
position
in
the
community
the
idea
of
your
going
around
places
gawping
into
a
female
eyes
like
a
pup
i
can
understand
a
fellow
slipping
once
but
i
propose
to
see
a
fellow
that
been
as
chummy
with
me
as
you
have
getting
started
on
the
downward
path
and
sneaking
off
from
his
wife
even
as
cranky
a
one
as
zilla
to
go
oh
you
a
perfectly
moral
little
husband
i
am
by
god
i
never
looked
at
any
woman
except
myra
since
been
married
practically
and
i
never
will
i
tell
you
there
nothing
to
immorality
it
do
pay
ca
you
see
old
man
it
just
makes
zilla
still
crankier
slight
of
resolution
as
he
was
of
body
paul
threw
his
overcoat
on
the
floor
and
crouched
on
a
flimsy
cane
chair
oh
an
old
blowhard
and
you
know
less
about
morality
than
tinka
but
all
right
georgie
but
you
ca
understand
that
i
through
i
go
zilla
hammering
any
longer
she
made
up
her
mind
that
i
a
devil
and
inquisition
torture
she
enjoys
it
it
a
game
to
see
how
sore
she
can
make
me
and
me
either
it
find
a
little
comfort
any
comfort
anywhere
or
else
do
something
a
lot
worse
now
this
arnold
she
not
so
young
but
she
a
fine
woman
and
she
understands
a
fellow
and
she
had
her
own
yea
i
suppose
she
one
of
these
hens
whose
husband
understand
her
i
do
know
maybe
he
was
killed
in
the
babbitt
lumbered
up
stood
beside
paul
patting
his
shoulder
making
soft
apologetic
noises
honest
george
she
a
fine
woman
and
she
had
one
hell
of
a
time
we
manage
to
jolly
each
other
up
a
lot
we
tell
each
other
we
the
dandiest
pair
on
earth
maybe
we
do
believe
it
but
it
helps
a
lot
to
have
somebody
with
whom
you
can
be
perfectly
simple
and
not
all
this
discussing
explaining
and
that
as
far
as
you
go
it
is
not
go
on
say
it
well
i
do
i
ca
say
i
like
it
but
with
a
burst
which
left
him
feeling
large
and
shining
with
generosity
it
none
of
my
darn
business
i
do
anything
i
can
for
you
if
there
anything
i
can
there
might
be
i
judge
from
zilla
letters
that
been
forwarded
from
akron
that
she
getting
suspicious
about
my
staying
away
so
long
she
be
perfectly
capable
of
having
me
shadowed
and
of
coming
to
chicago
and
busting
into
a
hotel
and
bawling
me
out
before
i
take
care
of
zilla
i
hand
her
a
good
when
i
get
back
to
i
do
know
i
do
think
you
better
try
it
you
a
good
fellow
but
i
do
know
that
diplomacy
is
your
strong
babbitt
looked
hurt
then
irritated
i
mean
with
women
with
women
i
mean
course
they
got
to
go
some
to
beat
you
in
business
diplomacy
but
i
just
mean
with
women
zilla
may
do
a
lot
of
rough
talking
but
she
pretty
shrewd
she
have
the
story
out
of
you
in
no
well
all
right
but
babbitt
was
still
pathetic
at
not
being
allowed
to
play
secret
agent
paul
soothed
course
maybe
you
might
tell
her
you
been
in
akron
and
seen
me
why
sure
you
bet
do
i
have
to
go
look
at
that
property
in
akron
do
i
ai
it
a
shame
i
have
to
stop
off
there
when
i
so
anxious
to
get
home
ai
it
a
regular
shame
i
say
it
is
i
say
it
a
doggone
shame
fine
but
for
glory
hallelujah
sake
do
go
putting
any
fancy
fixings
on
the
story
when
men
lie
they
always
try
to
make
it
too
artistic
and
that
why
women
get
suspicious
and
let
have
a
drink
georgie
i
got
some
gin
and
a
little
the
paul
who
normally
refused
a
second
cocktail
took
a
second
now
and
a
third
he
became
and
he
was
embarrassingly
jocular
and
salacious
in
the
taxicab
babbitt
incredulously
found
tears
crowding
into
his
eyes
ii
he
had
not
told
paul
of
his
plan
but
he
did
stop
at
akron
between
trains
for
the
one
purpose
of
sending
to
zilla
a
postcard
with
had
to
come
here
for
the
day
ran
into
in
zenith
he
called
on
her
if
for
public
appearances
zilla
was
and
resolutely
corseted
for
private
misery
she
wore
a
filthy
blue
and
torn
stockings
thrust
into
streaky
pink
satin
mules
her
face
was
sunken
she
seemed
to
have
but
half
as
much
hair
as
babbitt
remembered
and
that
half
was
stringy
she
sat
in
a
rocker
amid
a
debris
of
and
cheap
magazines
and
she
sounded
dolorous
when
she
did
not
sound
derisive
but
babbitt
was
exceedingly
breezy
well
well
zil
old
dear
having
a
good
loaf
while
hubby
away
that
the
ideal
i
bet
a
hat
myra
never
got
up
till
ten
while
i
was
in
chicago
say
could
i
borrow
your
thermos
just
dropped
in
to
see
if
i
could
borrow
your
thermos
bottle
we
going
to
have
a
toboggan
party
want
to
take
some
coffee
mit
oh
did
you
get
my
card
from
akron
saying
i
run
into
paul
yes
what
was
he
doing
how
do
you
mean
he
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
sat
tentatively
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
you
know
how
i
mean
she
slapped
the
pages
of
a
magazine
with
an
irritable
clatter
i
suppose
he
was
trying
to
make
love
to
some
hotel
waitress
or
manicure
girl
or
hang
it
you
always
letting
on
that
paul
goes
round
chasing
skirts
he
does
in
the
first
place
and
if
he
did
it
would
be
because
you
keep
hinting
at
him
and
dinging
at
him
so
much
i
meant
to
zilla
but
since
paul
is
away
in
akron
he
really
is
in
akron
i
know
he
has
some
horrible
woman
that
he
writes
to
in
did
i
tell
you
i
saw
him
in
akron
what
you
trying
to
do
make
me
out
a
liar
no
but
i
just
i
get
so
now
there
you
are
that
what
gets
me
here
you
love
paul
and
yet
you
plague
him
and
cuss
him
out
as
if
you
hated
him
i
simply
understand
why
it
is
that
the
more
some
folks
love
people
the
harder
they
try
to
make
you
love
ted
and
rone
i
suppose
and
yet
you
nag
oh
well
that
that
different
besides
i
do
nag
not
what
you
call
nagging
but
zize
saying
now
here
paul
the
nicest
most
sensitive
critter
on
god
green
earth
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
the
way
you
pan
him
why
you
talk
to
him
like
a
washerwoman
i
surprised
you
can
act
so
doggone
common
zilla
she
brooded
over
her
linked
fingers
oh
i
know
i
do
go
and
get
mean
sometimes
and
i
sorry
afterwards
but
oh
georgie
paul
is
so
aggravating
honestly
i
tried
awfully
hard
these
last
few
years
to
be
nice
to
him
but
just
because
i
used
to
be
spiteful
or
i
seemed
so
i
was
really
but
i
used
to
speak
up
and
say
anything
that
came
into
my
head
and
so
he
made
up
his
mind
that
everything
was
my
fault
everything
ca
always
be
my
fault
can
it
and
now
if
i
get
to
fussing
he
just
turns
silent
oh
so
dreadfully
silent
and
he
wo
look
at
me
he
just
ignores
me
he
simply
is
human
and
he
deliberately
keeps
it
up
till
i
bust
out
and
say
a
lot
of
things
i
mean
so
silent
oh
you
righteous
men
how
wicked
you
are
how
rotten
wicked
they
thrashed
things
over
and
over
for
half
an
hour
at
the
end
weeping
drably
zilla
promised
to
restrain
herself
paul
returned
four
days
later
and
the
babbitts
and
rieslings
went
festively
to
the
movies
and
had
chop
suey
at
a
chinese
restaurant
as
they
walked
to
the
restaurant
through
a
street
of
tailor
shops
and
barber
shops
the
two
wives
in
front
chattering
about
cooks
babbitt
murmured
to
paul
zil
seems
a
lot
nicer
yes
she
has
been

once
or
twice
but
it
too
late
now
i
just
i
not
going
to
discuss
it
but
i
afraid
of

nothing

do
ever
want
to

day
i
going

chapter
xxi
the
international
organization
of
boosters
clubs
has
become
a
for
optimism
manly
pleasantry
and
good
business
chapters
are
to
be
found
now
in
thirty
countries
nine
hundred
and
twenty
of
the
thousand
chapters
however
are
in
the
united
states
none
of
these
is
more
ardent
than
the
zenith
boosters
club
the
second
march
lunch
of
the
zenith
boosters
was
the
most
important
of
the
year
as
it
was
to
be
followed
by
the
annual
election
of
officers
there
was
agitation
abroad
the
lunch
was
held
in
the
ballroom
of
the
house
as
each
of
the
four
hundred
boosters
entered
he
took
from
a
a
huge
celluloid
button
announcing
his
name
his
nick
name
and
his
business
there
was
a
fine
of
ten
cents
for
calling
a
fellow
booster
by
anything
but
his
nickname
at
a
lunch
and
as
babbitt
jovially
checked
his
hat
the
air
was
radiant
with
shouts
of
hello
chet
and
how
you
shorty
and
top
o
the
mornin
mac
they
sat
at
friendly
tables
for
eight
choosing
places
by
lot
babbitt
was
with
albert
boos
the
merchant
tailor
hector
seybolt
of
the
little
sweetheart
condensed
milk
company
emil
wengert
the
jeweler
professor
pumphrey
of
the
riteway
business
college
walter
gorbutt
roy
teegarten
the
photographer
and
ben
berkey
the
one
of
the
merits
of
the
boosters
club
was
that
only
two
persons
from
each
department
of
business
were
permitted
to
join
so
that
you
at
once
encountered
the
ideals
of
other
occupations
and
realized
the
metaphysical
oneness
of
all
occupations
plumbing
and
medicine
and
the
manufacture
of
babbitt
table
was
particularly
happy
because
professor
pumphrey
had
just
had
a
birthday
and
was
therefore
open
to
teasing
let
pump
pump
about
how
old
he
is
said
emil
wengert
no
let
paddle
him
with
a
said
ben
berkey
but
it
was
babbitt
who
had
the
applause
with
do
talk
about
pumps
to
that
guy
the
only
pump
he
knows
is
a
bottle
honest
they
tell
me
starting
a
class
in
at
the
ole
college
at
each
place
was
the
boosters
club
booklet
listing
the
members
though
the
object
of
the
club
was
yet
they
never
lost
sight
of
the
importance
of
doing
a
little
more
business
after
each
name
was
the
member
occupation
there
were
scores
of
advertisements
in
the
booklet
and
on
one
page
the
admonition
there
no
rule
that
you
have
to
trade
with
your
fellow
boosters
but
get
wise
boy
what
the
use
of
letting
all
this
good
money
get
outside
of
our
happy
fambly
and
at
each
place
there
was
a
present
a
card
printed
in
artistic
red
and
black
service
and
boosterism
service
finds
its
finest
opportunity
and
development
only
in
its
broadest
and
deepest
application
and
the
consideration
of
its
perpetual
action
upon
reaction
i
believe
the
highest
type
of
service
like
the
most
progressive
tenets
of
ethics
senses
unceasingly
and
is
motived
by
active
adherence
and
loyalty
to
that
which
is
the
essential
principle
of
boosterism
good
citizenship
in
all
its
factors
and
aspects
dad

compliments
of

petersen
advertising

not
fads
at

the
boosters
all
read
peterson
aphorism
and
said
they
understood
it
perfectly
the
meeting
opened
with
the
regular
weekly
retiring
president
vergil
gunch
was
in
the
chair
his
stiff
hair
like
a
hedge
his
voice
like
a
brazen
gong
of
festival
members
who
had
brought
guests
introduced
them
publicly
this
tall
piece
of
misinformation
is
the
sporting

of
the
press
said

ijams
and
hazen
the
druggist
chanted
boys
when
you
on
a
long
motor
tour
and
finally
get
to
a
romantic
spot
or
scene
and
draw
up
and
remark
to
the
wife
is
certainly
a
romantic
place
it
sends
a
glow
right
up
and
down
your
vertebrae
well
my
guest
is
from
such
a
place
harper
ferry
virginia
in
the
beautiful
southland
with
memories
of
good
old
general
robert
lee
and
of
that
brave
soul
john
brown
who
like
every
good
booster
goes
marching
on
there
were
two
especially
distinguished
guests
the
leading
man
of
the
bird
of
paradise
company
playing
this
week
at
the
dodsworth
theater
and
the
mayor
of
zenith
the
hon
lucas
prout
vergil
gunch
thundered
when
we
manage
to
grab
this
celebrated
thespian
off
his
lovely
aggregation
of
beautiful
actresses
and
i
got
to
admit
i
butted
right
into
his
and
told
him
how
the
boosters
appreciated
the
artistic
performance
he
giving
us
and
do
forget
that
the
treasurer
of
the
dodsworth
is
a
booster
and
will
appreciate
our
patronage
and
when
on
top
of
that
we
yank
hizzonor
out
of
his
multifarious
duties
at
city
hall
then
i
feel
we
done
ourselves
proud
and
prout
will
now
say
a
few
words
about
the
problems
and
duties
by
rising
vote
the
boosters
decided
which
was
the
handsomest
and
which
the
ugliest
guest
and
to
each
of
them
was
given
a
bunch
of
carnations
donated
president
gunch
noted
by
brother
booster
yeager
the
jennifer
avenue
florist
each
week
in
rotation
four
boosters
were
privileged
to
obtain
the
pleasures
of
generosity
and
of
publicity
by
donating
goods
or
services
to
four
chosen
by
lot
there
was
laughter
this
week
when
it
was
announced
that
one
of
the
contributors
was
barnabas
joy
the
undertaker
everybody
whispered
i
can
think
of
a
coupla
good
guys
to
be
buried
if
his
donation
is
a
free
funeral
through
all
these
diversions
the
boosters
were
lunching
on
chicken
croquettes
peas
fried
potatoes
coffee
apple
pie
and
american
cheese
gunch
did
not
lump
the
speeches
presently
he
called
on
the
visiting
secretary
of
the
zenith
rotary
club
a
rival
organization
the
secretary
had
the
distinction
of
possessing
state
motor
car
license
number
the
rotary
secretary
laughingly
admitted
that
wherever
he
drove
in
the
state
so
low
a
number
created
a
sensation
and
though
it
was
pretty
nice
to
have
the
honor
yet
traffic
cops
remembered
it
only
too
darn
well
and
sometimes
he
did
know
but
what
he
almost
as
soon
have
just
plain
or
something
like
that
only
let
any
doggone
booster
try
to
get
number
away
from
a
live
rotarian
next
year
and
watch
the
fur
fly
and
if
they
permit
him
he
wind
up
by
calling
for
a
cheer
for
the
boosters
and
rotarians
and
the
kiwanis
all
together
babbitt
sighed
to
professor
pumphrey
be
pretty
nice
to
have
as
low
a
number
as
that
everybody
say
must
be
an
important
guy
wonder
how
he
got
it
i
bet
he
wined
and
dined
the
superintendent
of
the
motor
license
bureau
to
a
then
chum
frink
addressed
them
some
of
you
may
feel
that
it
out
of
place
here
to
talk
on
a
strictly
highbrow
and
artistic
subject
but
i
want
to
come
out
flatfooted
and
ask
you
boys
to
the
proposition
of
a
symphony
orchestra
for
zenith
now
where
a
lot
of
you
make
your
mistake
is
in
assuming
that
if
you
do
like
classical
music
and
all
that
junk
you
ought
to
oppose
it
now
i
want
to
confess
that
though
i
a
literary
guy
by
profession
i
do
care
a
rap
for
all
this
music
i
rather
listen
to
a
good
jazz
band
any
time
than
to
some
piece
by
beethoven
that
has
any
more
tune
to
it
than
a
bunch
of
fighting
cats
and
you
could
whistle
it
to
save
your
life
but
that
is
the
point
culture
has
become
as
necessary
an
adornment
and
advertisement
for
a
city
as
pavements
or
it
culture
in
theaters
and
and
so
on
that
brings
thousands
of
visitors
to
new
york
every
year
and
to
be
frank
for
all
our
splendid
attainments
we
have
yet
got
the
culture
of
a
new
york
or
chicago
or
boston
or
at
least
we
do
get
the
credit
for
it
the
thing
to
do
then
as
a
live
bunch
of
is
to
capitalize
culture
to
go
right
out
and
grab
it
pictures
and
books
are
fine
for
those
that
have
the
time
to
study
but
they
do
shoot
out
on
the
road
and
holler
is
what
little
old
zenith
can
put
up
in
the
way
of
culture
that
precisely
what
a
symphony
orchestra
does
do
look
at
the
credit
minneapolis
and
cincinnati
get
an
orchestra
with
musickers
and
a
swell
conductor
and
i
believe
we
ought
to
do
the
thing
up
brown
and
get
one
of
the
conductors
on
the
market
providing
he
ai
a
hun
it
goes
right
into
beantown
and
new
york
and
washington
it
plays
at
the
best
theaters
to
the
most
cultured
and
moneyed
people
it
gives
such
as
a
town
can
get
in
no
other
way
and
the
guy
who
is
so
as
to
crab
this
orchestra
proposition
is
passing
up
the
chance
to
impress
the
glorious
name
of
zenith
on
some
big
new
york
millionaire
that
might
establish
a
branch
factory
here
i
could
also
go
into
the
fact
that
for
our
daughters
who
show
an
interest
in
highbrow
music
and
may
want
to
teach
it
having
an
local
organization
is
of
great
benefit
but
let
keep
this
on
a
practical
basis
and
i
call
on
you
good
brothers
to
whoop
it
up
for
culture
and
a
symphony
orchestra
they
applauded
to
a
rustle
of
excitement
president
gunch
proclaimed
gentlemen
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
annual
election
of

each
of
the
six

a
committee

surprised

gunch
said
a
pleasure
to
announce
that

babbitt

our
best
long
yell
as
they
adjourned
a
hundred
men
crushed
in
to
slap
his
back
he
had
never
known
a
higher
moment
he
drove
away
in
a
blur
of
wonder
he
lunged
into
his
office
chuckling
to
miss
mcgoun
well
i
guess

this
noon
she
may
not
chapter
xxii
i
he
drove
to
the
city
prison
not
blindly
but
with
unusual
fussy
care
at
corners
the
fussiness
of
an
old
woman
potting
plants
it
kept
him
from
facing
the
obscenity
of
fate
the
attendant
said
naw
you
ca
see
any
of
the
prisoners
till
it
was
three
for
half
an
hour
babbitt
sat
looking
at
a
calendar
and
a
clock
on
a
whitewashed
wall
the
chair
was
hard
and
mean
and
creaky
people
went
through
the
office
and
he
thought
stared
at
him
he
felt
a
belligerent
defiance
which
broke
into
a
wincing
fear
of
this
machine
which
was
grinding
paul
paul
exactly
at
three
he
sent
in
his
name
the
attendant
returned
with
riesling
says
he
do
want
to
see
you
crazy
you
did
give
him
my
name

him
it
george

to
see
him
george
yuh

told
him

said

me
in
nothing
doing
if
you
ai
his
lawyer
if
he
do
want
to
see

that
all
there
is
to
but
my
god
say
let
me
see
the
he
busy
come
on
now
you
babbitt
reared
over
him
the
attendant
hastily
changed
to
a
coaxing
you
can
come
back
and
try
probably
the
poor
guy
is
off
his
babbitt
drove
not
at
all
carefully
or
fussily
sliding
viciously
past
trucks
ignoring
the
truckmen
curses
to
the
city
hall
he
stopped
with
a
grind
of
wheels
against
the
curb
and
ran
up
the
marble
steps
to
the
office
of
the
hon
lucas
prout
the
mayor
he
bribed
the
doorman
with
a
dollar
he
was
instantly
inside
demanding
you
remember
me
prout
babbitt
of
the
boosters
campaigned
for
you
say
have
you
heard
about
poor
riesling
well
i
want
an
order
on
the
warden
or
whatever
you
call
um
of
the
city
prison
to
take
me
back
and
see
him
good
in
fifteen
minutes
he
was
pounding
down
the
prison
corridor
to
a
cage
where
paul
riesling
sat
on
a
cot
twisted
like
an
old
beggar
legs
crossed
arms
in
a
knot
biting
at
his
clenched
fist
paul
looked
up
blankly
as
the
keeper
unlocked
the
cell
admitted
babbitt
and
left
them
together
he
spoke
slowly
go
on
be
moral
babbitt
plumped
on
the
couch
beside
him
i
not
going
to
be
moral
i
do
care
what
happened
i
just
want
to
do
anything
i
can
i
glad
zilla
got
what
was
coming
to
paul
said
argumentatively
now
do
go
jumping
on
zilla
i
been
thinking
maybe
she
has
had
any
too
easy
a
time
just
after
i
shot
her
i
did
hardly
mean
to
but
she
got
to
deviling
me
so
i
went
crazy
just
for
a
second
and
pulled
out
that
old
revolver
you
and
i
used
to
shoot
rabbits
with
and
took
a
crack
at
her
did
hardly
mean
to
after
that
when
i
was
trying
to
stop
the
blood
it
was
terrible
what
it
did
to
her
shoulder
and
she
had
beautiful
skin
maybe
she
die
i
hope
it
wo
leave
her
skin
all
scarred
but
just
afterward
when
i
was
hunting
through
the
bathroom
for
some
cotton
to
stop
the
blood
i
ran
onto
a
little
fuzzy
yellow
duck
we
hung
on
the
tree
one
christmas
and
i
remembered
she
and
i
been
awfully
happy
then
hell
i
ca
hardly
believe
it
me
as
babbitt
arm
tightened
about
his
shoulder
paul
sighed
i
glad
you
came
but
i
thought
maybe
lecture
me
and
when
you
committed
a
murder
and
been
brought
here
and
everything
there
was
a
big
crowd
outside
the
apartment
house
all
staring
and
the
cops
took
me
through
it
oh
i
not
going
to
talk
about
it
any
but
he
went
on
in
a
monotonous
terrified
insane
mumble
to
divert
him
babbitt
said
why
you
got
a
scar
on
your
yes
that
where
the
cop
hit
me
i
suppose
cops
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
lecturing
murderers
too
he
was
a
big
fellow
and
they
would
let
me
help
carry
zilla
down
to
the
paul
quit
it
listen
she
wo
die
and
when
it
all
over
you
and
i
go
off
to
maine
again
and
maybe
we
can
get
that
may
arnold
to
go
along
i
go
up
to
chicago
and
ask
her
good
woman
by
golly
and
afterwards
i
see
that
you
get
started
in
business
out
west
somewhere
maybe
seattle
they
say
that
a
lovely
paul
was
half
smiling
it
was
babbitt
who
rambled
now
he
could
not
tell
whether
paul
was
heeding
but
he
droned
on
till
the
coming
of
lawyer
maxwell
a
thin
busy
unfriendly
man
who
nodded
at
babbitt
and
hinted
if
riesling
and
i
could
be
alone
for
a
moment
babbitt
wrung
paul
hands
and
waited
in
the
office
till
maxwell
came
pattering
out
look
old
man
what
can
i
do
he
begged
nothing
not
a
thing
not
just
now
said
maxwell
sorry
got
to
hurry
and
do
try
to
see
him
i
had
the
doctor
give
him
a
shot
of
morphine
so
he
it
seemed
somehow
wicked
to
return
to
the
office
babbitt
felt
as
though
he
had
just
come
from
a
funeral
he
drifted
out
to
the
city
hospital
to
inquire
about
zilla
she
was
not
likely
to
die
he
learned
the
bullet
from
paul
huge
old
army
revolver
had
smashed
her
shoulder
and
torn
upward
and
out
he
wandered
home
and
found
his
wife
radiant
with
the
horified
interest
we
have
in
the
tragedies
of
our
friends
of
course
paul
altogether
to
blame
but
this
is
what
comes
of
his
chasing
after
other
women
instead
of
bearing
his
cross
in
a
christian
way
she
exulted
he
was
too
languid
to
respond
as
he
desired
he
said
what
was
to
be
said
about
the
christian
bearing
of
crosses
and
went
out
to
clean
the
car
dully
patiently
he
scraped
linty
grease
from
the
gouged
at
the
mud
caked
on
the
wheels
he
used
up
many
minutes
in
washing
his
hands
scoured
them
with
gritty
kitchen
soap
rejoiced
in
hurting
his
plump
knuckles
damn
soft
hands
like
a
woman
aah
at
dinner
when
his
wife
began
the
inevitable
he
bellowed
i
forbid
any
of
you
to
say
a
word
about
paul
i
to
all
the
talking
about
this
that
necessary
hear
me
there
going
to
be
one
house
in
this
town
that
is
going
to
spring
the
and
throw
those
filthy
evening
papers
out
of
the
house
but
he
himself
read
the
papers
after
dinner
before
nine
he
set
out
for
the
house
of
lawyer
maxwell
he
was
received
without
cordiality
well
said
maxwell
i
want
to
offer
my
services
in
the
trial
i
got
an
idea
why
could
i
go
on
the
stand
and
swear
i
was
there
and
she
pulled
the
gun
first
and
he
wrestled
with
her
and
the
gun
went
off
accidentally
and
perjure
yourself
huh
yes
i
suppose
it
would
be
perjury
oh
would
it
help
but
my
dear
fellow
perjury
oh
do
be
a
fool
excuse
me
maxwell
i
did
mean
to
get
your
goat
i
just
mean
i
known
and
you
known
many
and
many
a
case
of
perjury
just
to
annex
some
rotten
little
piece
of
real
estate
and
here
where
it
a
case
of
saving
paul
from
going
to
prison
i
perjure
myself
black
in
the
no
aside
from
the
ethics
of
the
matter
i
afraid
it
practicable
the
prosecutor
would
tear
your
testimony
to
pieces
known
that
only
riesling
and
his
wife
were
there
at
the
then
look
here
let
me
go
on
the
stand
and
swear
and
this
would
be
the
god
truth
that
she
pestered
him
till
he
kind
of
went
no
sorry
riesling
absolutely
refuses
to
have
any
testimony
reflecting
on
his
wife
he
insists
on
pleading
then
let
me
get
up
and
testify
something
whatever
you
say
let
me
do
something
i
sorry
babbitt
but
the
best
thing
you
can
do
i
hate
to
say
it
but
you
could
help
us
most
by
keeping
strictly
out
of
babbitt
revolving
his
hat
like
a
defaulting
poor
tenant
winced
so
visibly
that
maxwell
condescended
i
do
like
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
you
see
we
both
want
to
do
our
best
for
riesling
and
we
must
consider
any
other
factor
the
trouble
with
you
babbitt
is
that
you
one
of
these
fellows
who
talk
too
readily
you
like
to
hear
your
own
voice
if
there
were
anything
for
which
i
could
put
you
in
the
you
get
going
and
give
the
whole
show
away
sorry
now
i
must
look
over
some
papers
so
ii
he
spent
most
of
the
next
morning
nerving
himself
to
face
the
garrulous
world
of
the
athletic
club
they
would
talk
about
paul
they
would
be
and
rotten
but
at
the
roughnecks
table
they
did
not
mention
paul
they
spoke
with
zeal
of
the
coming
baseball
season
he
loved
them
as
he
never
had
before
iii
he
had
doubtless
from
some
pictured
paul
trial
as
a
long
struggle
with
bitter
arguments
a
taut
crowd
and
sudden
and
overwhelming
new
testimony
actually
the
trial
occupied
less
than
fifteen
minutes
largely
filled
with
the
evidence
of
doctors
that
zilla
would
recover
and
that
paul
must
have
been
temporarily
insane
next
day
paul
was
sentenced
to
three
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
and
taken
off
quite
undramatically
not
handcuffed
merely
plodding
in
a
tired
way
beside
a
cheerful
deputy
sheriff
and
after
saying
to
him
at
the
station
babbitt
returned
to
his
office
to
realize
that
he
faced
a
world
which
without
paul
was
meaningless
chapter
xxiii
i
he
was
busy
from
march
to
june
he
kept
himself
from
the
bewilderment
of
thinking
his
wife
and
the
neighbors
were
generous
every
evening
he
played
bridge
or
attended
the
movies
and
the
days
were
blank
of
face
and
silent
in
june
babbitt
and
tinka
went
east
to
stay
with
relatives
and
babbitt
was
free
to
do
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
all
day
long
after
their
departure
he
thought
of
the
emancipated
house
in
which
he
could
if
he
desired
go
mad
and
curse
the
gods
without
having
to
keep
up
a
husbandly
front
he
considered
i
could
have
a
party
stay
out
till
two
and
not
do
any
explaining
afterwards
cheers
he
telephoned
to
vergil
gunch
to
eddie
swanson
both
of
them
were
engaged
for
the
evening
and
suddenly
he
was
bored
by
having
to
take
so
much
trouble
to
be
riotous
he
was
silent
at
dinner
unusually
kindly
to
ted
and
verona
hesitating
but
not
disapproving
when
verona
stated
her
opinion
of
kenneth
opinion
of
john
jennison
drew
opinion
of
the
opinions
of
the
evolutionists
ted
was
working
in
a
garage
through
the
summer
vacation
and
he
related
his
daily
triumphs
how
he
had
found
a
cracked
what
he
had
said
to
the
old
grouch
what
he
had
said
to
the
foreman
about
the
future
of
wireless
telephony
ted
and
verona
went
to
a
dance
after
dinner
even
the
maid
was
out
rarely
had
babbitt
been
alone
in
the
house
for
an
entire
evening
he
was
restless
he
vaguely
wanted
something
more
diverting
than
the
newspaper
comic
strips
to
read
he
ambled
up
to
verona
room
sat
on
her
maidenly
blue
and
white
bed
humming
and
grunting
in
a
manner
as
he
examined
her
books
conrad
rescue
a
volume
strangely
named
figures
of
earth
poetry
quite
irregular
poetry
babbitt
thought
by
vachel
lindsay
and
essays
by
mencken
highly
improper
essays
making
fun
of
the
church
and
all
the
decencies
he
liked
none
of
the
books
in
them
he
felt
a
spirit
of
rebellion
against
niceness
and
these
authors
and
he
supposed
they
were
famous
ones
too
did
not
seem
to
care
about
telling
a
good
story
which
would
enable
a
fellow
to
forget
his
troubles
he
sighed
he
noted
a
book
the
three
black
pennies
by
joseph
hergesheimer
ah
that
was
something
like
it
it
would
be
an
adventure
story
maybe
about
counterfeiting
detectives
sneaking
up
on
the
old
house
at
night
he
tucked
the
book
under
his
arm
he
clumped
and
solemnly
began
to
read
under
the
a
twilight
like
blue
dust
sifted
into
the
shallow
fold
of
the
thickly
wooded
hills
it
was
early
october
but
a
crisping
frost
had
already
stamped
the
maple
trees
with
gold
the
spanish
oaks
were
hung
with
patches
of
wine
red
the
sumach
was
brilliant
in
the
darkening
underbrush
a
pattern
of
wild
geese
flying
low
and
unconcerned
above
the
hills
wavered
against
the
serene
ashen
evening
howat
penny
standing
in
the
comparative
clearing
of
a
road
decided
that
the
shifting
regular
flight
would
not
come
close
enough
for
a
shot
he
had
no
intention
of
hunting
the
geese
with
the
drooping
of
day
his
keenness
had
evaporated
an
habitual
indifference
strengthened
permeating
him
there
it
was
again
discontent
with
the
good
common
ways
babbitt
laid
down
the
book
and
listened
to
the
stillness
the
inner
doors
of
the
house
were
open
he
heard
from
the
kitchen
the
steady
drip
of
the
refrigerator
a
rhythm
demanding
and
disquieting
he
roamed
to
the
window
the
summer
evening
was
foggy
and
seen
through
the
wire
screen
the
street
lamps
were
crosses
of
pale
fire
the
whole
world
was
abnormal
while
he
brooded
verona
and
ted
came
in
and
went
up
to
bed
silence
thickened
in
the
sleeping
house
he
put
on
his
hat
his
respectable
derby
lighted
a
cigar
and
walked
up
and
down
before
the
house
a
portly
worthy
unimaginative
figure
humming
silver
threads
among
the
he
casually
considered
might
call
up
then
he
remembered
he
saw
paul
in
a
jailbird
uniform
but
while
he
agonized
he
did
believe
the
tale
it
was
part
of
the
unreality
of
this
evening
if
she
were
here
myra
would
be
hinting
is
it
late
georgie
he
tramped
in
forlorn
and
unwanted
freedom
fog
hid
the
house
now
the
world
was
uncreated
a
chaos
without
turmoil
or
desire
through
the
mist
came
a
man
at
so
feverish
a
pace
that
he
seemed
to
dance
with
fury
as
he
entered
the
orb
of
glow
from
a
at
each
step
he
brandished
his
stick
and
brought
it
down
with
a
crash
his
glasses
on
their
broad
pretentious
ribbon
banged
against
his
stomach
babbitt
incredulously
saw
that
it
was
chum
frink
frink
stopped
focused
his
vision
and
spoke
with
gravity
there
another
fool
george
babbitt
lives
for
renting
howshes
houses
know
who
i
am
i
traitor
to
poetry
i
drunk
talking
too
much
i
do
care
know
what
i
could
been
i
could
been
a
gene
field
or
a
james
whitcomb
riley
maybe
a
stevenson
i
could
whimsies
lissen
lissen
to
this
just
made
it
up
glittering
summery
meadowy
noise
of
beetles
and
bums
and
respectable
boys
hear
that
whimzh
whimsy
i
made
that
up
i
do
know
what
it
means
beginning
good
verse
chile
garden
verses
and
whadi
write
tripe
poems
all
tripe
could
have
written
too
late
he
darted
on
with
an
alarming
plunge
seeming
always
to
pitch
forward
yet
never
quite
falling
babbitt
would
have
been
no
more
astonished
and
no
less
had
a
ghost
skipped
out
of
the
fog
carrying
his
head
he
accepted
frink
with
vast
apathy
he
grunted
poor
boob
and
straightway
forgot
him
he
plodded
into
the
house
deliberately
went
to
the
refrigerator
and
rifled
it
when
babbitt
was
at
home
this
was
one
of
the
major
household
crimes
he
stood
before
the
covered
laundry
tubs
eating
a
chicken
leg
and
half
a
saucer
of
raspberry
jelly
and
grumbling
over
a
clammy
cold
boiled
potato
he
was
thinking
it
was
coming
to
him
that
perhaps
all
life
as
he
knew
it
and
vigorously
practised
it
was
futile
that
heaven
as
portrayed
by
the
reverend
john
jennison
drew
was
neither
probable
nor
very
interesting
that
he
had
much
pleasure
out
of
making
money
that
it
was
of
doubtful
worth
to
rear
children
merely
that
they
might
rear
children
who
would
rear
children
what
was
it
all
about
what
did
he
want
he
blundered
into
the
lay
on
the
davenport
hands
behind
his
head
what
did
he
want
wealth
social
position
travel
servants
yes
but
only
incidentally
i
give
it
up
he
sighed
but
he
did
know
that
he
wanted
the
presence
of
paul
riesling
and
from
that
he
stumbled
into
the
admission
that
he
wanted
the
fairy
girl
in
the
flesh
if
there
had
been
a
woman
whom
he
loved
he
would
have
fled
to
her
humbled
his
forehead
on
her
knees
he
thought
of
his
stenographer
miss
mcgoun
he
thought
of
the
prettiest
of
the
manicure
girls
at
the
hotel
thornleigh
barber
shop
as
he
fell
asleep
on
the
davenport
he
felt
that
he
had
found
something
in
life
and
that
he
had
made
a
terrifying
thrilling
break
with
everything
that
was
decent
and
normal
ii
he
had
forgotten
next
morning
that
he
was
a
conscious
rebel
but
he
was
irritable
in
the
office
and
at
the
eleven
drive
of
telephone
calls
and
visitors
he
did
something
he
had
often
desired
and
never
dared
he
left
the
office
without
excuses
to
those
his
employees
and
went
to
the
movies
he
enjoyed
the
right
to
be
alone
he
came
out
with
a
vicious
determination
to
do
what
he
pleased
as
he
approached
the
roughnecks
table
at
the
club
everybody
laughed
well
here
the
millionaire
said
sidney
finkelstein
yes
i
saw
him
in
his
locomobile
said
professor
pumphrey
gosh
it
must
be
great
to
be
a
smart
guy
like
georgie
moaned
vergil
gunch
he
probably
stolen
all
of
dorchester
i
hate
to
leave
a
poor
little
defenseless
piece
of
property
lying
around
where
he
could
get
his
hooks
on
it
they
had
babbitt
perceived
something
on
also
they
had
their
kidding
clothes
ordinarily
he
would
have
been
delighted
at
the
honor
implied
in
being
chaffed
but
he
was
suddenly
touchy
he
grunted
yuh
sure
maybe
i
take
you
guys
on
as
office
boys
he
was
impatient
as
the
jest
elaborately
rolled
on
to
its
denouement
of
course
he
may
have
been
meeting
a
girl
they
said
and
no
i
think
he
was
waiting
for
his
old
roommate
sir
jerusalem
he
exploded
oh
spring
it
spring
it
you
boneheads
what
the
great
joke
hurray
george
is
peeved
snickered
sidney
finkelstein
while
a
grin
went
round
the
table
gunch
revealed
the
shocking
truth
he
had
seen
babbitt
coming
out
of
a
theater
at
noon
they
kept
it
up
with
a
hundred
variations
a
hundred
guffaws
they
said
that
he
had
gone
to
the
movies
during
he
did
so
much
mind
gunch
but
he
was
annoyed
by
sidney
finkelstein
that
brisk
lean
explainer
of
jokes
he
was
bothered
too
by
the
lump
of
ice
in
his
glass
of
water
it
was
too
large
it
spun
round
and
burned
his
nose
when
he
tried
to
drink
he
raged
that
finkelstein
was
like
that
lump
of
ice
but
he
won
through
he
kept
up
his
banter
till
they
grew
tired
of
the
superlative
jest
and
turned
to
the
great
problems
of
the
day
he
reflected
what
the
matter
with
me
seems
like
i
got
an
awful
grouch
only
they
talk
so
darn
much
but
i
better
steer
careful
and
keep
my
mouth
as
they
lighted
their
cigars
he
mumbled
got
to
get
back
and
on
a
chorus
of
if
you
will
go
spending
your
mornings
with
lady
ushers
at
the
movies
he
escaped
he
heard
them
giggling
he
was
embarrassed
while
he
was
most
bombastically
agreeing
with
the
that
the
weather
was
warm
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
longing
to
run
childishly
with
his
troubles
to
the
comfort
of
the
fairy
child
iii
he
kept
miss
mcgoun
after
he
had
finished
dictating
he
searched
for
a
topic
which
would
warm
her
office
impersonality
into
friendliness
where
you
going
on
your
vacation
he
purred
i
think
i
go
to
a
farm
do
you
want
me
to
have
the
siddons
lease
copied
this
afternoon
oh
no
hurry
about
it
i
suppose
you
have
a
great
time
when
you
get
away
from
us
cranks
in
the
she
rose
and
gathered
her
pencils
oh
nobody
cranky
here
i
think
i
can
get
it
copied
after
i
do
the
she
was
gone
babbitt
utterly
repudiated
the
view
that
he
had
been
trying
to
discover
how
approachable
was
miss
mcgoun
course
knew
there
was
nothing
doing
he
said
iv
eddie
swanson
the
agent
who
lived
across
the
street
from
babbitt
was
giving
a
sunday
supper
his
wife
louetta
young
louetta
who
loved
jazz
in
music
and
in
clothes
and
laughter
was
at
her
wildest
she
cried
we
have
a
real
party
as
she
received
the
guests
babbitt
had
uneasily
felt
that
to
many
men
she
might
be
alluring
now
he
admitted
that
to
himself
she
was
overwhelmingly
alluring
babbitt
had
never
quite
approved
of
louetta
babbitt
was
glad
that
she
was
not
here
this
evening
he
insisted
on
helping
louetta
in
the
kitchen
taking
the
chicken
croquettes
from
the
the
lettuce
sandwiches
from
the
he
held
her
hand
once
and
she
depressingly
did
notice
it
she
caroled
you
a
good
little
georgie
now
trot
in
with
the
tray
and
leave
it
on
the
he
wished
that
eddie
swanson
would
give
them
cocktails
that
louetta
would
have
one
he
wanted
oh
he
wanted
to
be
one
of
these
bohemians
you
read
about
studio
parties
wild
lovely
girls
who
were
independent
not
necessarily
bad
certainly
not
but
not
tame
like
floral
heights
how
he
ever
stood
it
all
these
years
eddie
did
not
give
them
cocktails
true
they
supped
with
mirth
and
with
several
repetitions
by
orville
jones
of
any
time
louetta
wants
to
come
sit
on
my
lap
i
tell
this
sandwich
to
beat
it
but
they
were
respectable
as
befitted
sunday
evening
babbitt
had
discreetly
preempted
a
place
beside
louetta
on
the
piano
bench
while
he
talked
about
motors
while
he
listened
with
a
fixed
smile
to
her
account
of
the
film
she
had
seen
last
wednesday
while
he
hoped
that
she
would
hurry
up
and
finish
her
description
of
the
plot
the
beauty
of
the
leading
man
and
the
luxury
of
the
setting
he
studied
her
slim
waist
girdled
with
raw
silk
strong
brows
ardent
eyes
hair
parted
above
a
broad
forehead
she
meant
youth
to
him
and
a
charm
which
saddened
he
thought
of
how
valiant
a
companion
she
would
be
on
a
long
motor
tour
exploring
mountains
picnicking
in
a
pine
grove
high
above
a
valley
her
frailness
touched
him
he
was
angry
at
eddie
swanson
for
the
incessant
family
bickering
all
at
once
he
identified
louetta
with
the
fairy
girl
he
was
startled
by
the
conviction
that
they
had
always
had
a
romantic
attraction
for
each
other
i
suppose
you
leading
a
simply
terrible
life
now
you
a
widower
she
said
you
bet
i
a
bad
little
fellow
and
proud
of
it
some
evening
you
slip
eddie
some
dope
in
his
coffee
and
sneak
across
the
road
and
i
show
you
how
to
mix
a
cocktail
he
roared
well
now
i
might
do
it
you
never
can
tell
well
whenever
you
ready
you
just
hang
a
towel
out
of
the
attic
window
and
i
jump
for
the
gin
every
one
giggled
at
this
naughtiness
in
a
pleased
way
eddie
swanson
stated
that
he
would
have
a
physician
analyze
his
coffee
daily
the
others
were
diverted
to
a
discussion
of
the
more
agreeable
recent
murders
but
babbitt
drew
louetta
back
to
personal
things
that
the
prettiest
dress
i
ever
saw
in
my
do
you
honestly
like
it
like
it
why
say
i
going
to
have
kenneth
escott
put
a
piece
in
the
paper
saying
that
the
swellest
dressed
woman
in
the
is
louetta
now
you
stop
teasing
me
but
she
beamed
let
dance
a
little
george
you
got
to
dance
with
even
as
he
protested
oh
you
know
what
a
rotten
dancer
i
am
he
was
lumbering
to
his
feet
i
teach
you
i
can
teach
her
eyes
were
moist
her
voice
was
jagged
with
excitement
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
won
her
he
clasped
her
conscious
of
her
smooth
warmth
and
solemnly
he
circled
in
a
heavy
version
of
the
he
bumped
into
only
one
or
two
people
gosh
i
not
doing
so
bad
up
like
a
regular
stage
dancer
he
gloated
and
she
answered
busily
yes
yes
i
told
you
i
could
teach
anybody
do
take
such
long
steps
for
a
moment
he
was
robbed
of
confidence
with
fearful
concentration
he
sought
to
keep
time
to
the
music
but
he
was
enveloped
again
by
her
enchantment
she
got
to
like
me
i
make
her
he
vowed
he
tried
to
kiss
the
lock
beside
her
ear
she
mechanically
moved
her
head
to
avoid
it
and
mechanically
she
murmured
do
for
a
moment
he
hated
her
but
after
the
moment
he
was
as
urgent
as
ever
he
danced
with
orville
jones
but
he
watched
louetta
swooping
down
the
length
of
the
room
with
her
husband
careful
you
getting
foolish
he
cautioned
himself
the
while
he
hopped
and
bent
his
solid
knees
in
dalliance
with
jones
and
to
that
worthy
lady
rumbled
gee
it
hot
without
reason
he
thought
of
paul
in
that
shadowy
place
where
men
never
dance
i
crazy
better
go
home
he
worried
but
he
left
jones
and
dashed
to
louetta
lovely
side
demanding
the
next
is
oh
i
so
hot
i
not
going
to
dance
this
then
boldly
come
out
and
sit
on
the
porch
and
get
all
nice
and
well
in
the
tender
darkness
with
the
clamor
in
the
house
behind
them
he
resolutely
took
her
hand
she
squeezed
his
once
then
relaxed
louetta
i
think
you
the
nicest
thing
i
know
well
i
think
you
very
do
you
you
got
to
like
me
i
so
lonely
oh
you
be
all
right
when
your
wife
comes
no
i
always
she
clasped
her
hands
under
her
chin
so
that
he
dared
not
touch
her
he
sighed
when
i
feel
punk
and
he
was
about
to
bring
in
the
tragedy
of
paul
but
that
was
too
sacred
even
for
the
diplomacy
of
love
when
i
get
tired
out
at
the
office
and
everything
i
like
to
look
across
the
street
and
think
of
you
do
you
know
i
dreamed
of
you
one
time
was
it
a
nice
dream
lovely
oh
well
they
say
dreams
go
by
opposites
now
i
must
run
she
was
on
her
feet
oh
do
go
in
yet
please
louetta
yes
i
must
have
to
look
out
for
my
let
look
out
for
i
could
do
she
carelessly
tapped
his
shoulder
and
slipped
away
but
after
two
minutes
of
shamed
and
childish
longing
to
sneak
home
he
was
snorting
certainly
i
was
trying
to
get
chummy
with
her
knew
there
was
nothing
doing
all
the
time
and
he
ambled
in
to
dance
with
orville
jones
and
to
avoid
louetta
virtuously
and
conspicuously
chapter
xxiv
i
his
visit
to
paul
was
as
unreal
as
his
night
of
fog
and
questioning
unseeing
he
went
through
prison
corridors
stinking
of
carbolic
acid
to
a
room
lined
with
pale
yellow
settees
pierced
in
rosettes
like
the
benches
he
had
known
as
a
boy
the
guard
led
in
paul
above
his
uniform
of
linty
gray
paul
face
was
pale
and
without
expression
he
moved
timorously
in
response
to
the
guard
commands
he
meekly
pushed
babbitt
gifts
of
tobacco
and
magazines
across
the
table
to
the
guard
for
examination
he
had
nothing
to
say
but
oh
i
getting
used
to
it
and
i
working
in
the
tailor
shop
the
stuff
hurts
my
babbitt
knew
that
in
this
place
of
death
paul
was
already
dead
and
as
he
pondered
on
the
train
home
something
in
his
own
self
seemed
to
have
died
a
loyal
and
vigorous
faith
in
the
goodness
of
the
world
a
fear
of
public
disfavor
a
pride
in
success
he
was
glad
that
his
wife
was
away
he
admitted
it
without
justifying
it
he
did
not
care
ii
her
card
read
mrs
daniel
babbitt
knew
of
her
as
the
widow
of
a
wholesale
she
must
have
been
forty
or
but
he
thought
her
younger
when
he
saw
her
in
the
office
that
afternoon
she
had
come
to
inquire
about
renting
an
apartment
and
he
took
her
away
from
the
unskilled
girl
accountant
he
was
nervously
attracted
by
her
smartness
she
was
a
slender
woman
in
a
black
swiss
frock
dotted
with
white
a
graceful
frock
a
broad
black
hat
shaded
her
face
her
eyes
were
lustrous
her
soft
chin
of
an
agreeable
plumpness
and
her
cheeks
an
even
rose
babbitt
wondered
afterward
if
she
was
made
up
but
no
man
living
knew
less
of
such
arts
she
sat
revolving
her
violet
parasol
her
voice
was
appealing
without
being
coy
i
wonder
if
you
can
help
me
be
i
looked
everywhere
and
i
want
a
little
flat
just
a
bedroom
or
perhaps
two
and
and
kitchenette
and
bath
but
i
want
one
that
really
has
some
charm
to
it
not
these
dingy
places
or
these
new
ones
with
terrible
gaudy
chandeliers
and
i
ca
pay
so
dreadfully
much
my
name
tanis
i
think
maybe
i
got
just
the
thing
for
you
would
you
like
to
chase
around
and
look
at
it
now
yes
i
have
a
couple
of
in
the
new
cavendish
apartments
babbitt
had
a
flat
which
he
had
been
holding
for
sidney
finkelstein
but
at
the
thought
of
driving
beside
this
agreeable
woman
he
threw
over
his
friend
finkelstein
and
with
a
note
of
gallantry
he
proclaimed
i
let
you
see
what
i
can
do
he
dusted
the
seat
of
the
car
for
her
and
twice
he
risked
death
in
showing
off
his
driving
you
do
know
how
to
handle
a
car
she
said
he
liked
her
voice
there
was
he
thought
music
in
it
and
a
hint
of
culture
not
a
bouncing
giggle
like
louetta
swanson
he
boasted
you
know
there
a
lot
of
these
fellows
that
are
so
scared
and
drive
so
slow
that
they
get
in
everybody
way
the
safest
driver
is
a
fellow
that
knows
how
to
handle
his
machine
and
yet
is
scared
to
speed
up
when
it
necessary
do
you
think
so
oh
yes
i
bet
you
drive
like
a
oh
no
i
mean
not
really
of
course
we
had
a
car
i
mean
before
my
husband
passed
on
and
i
used
to
make
believe
drive
it
but
i
think
any
woman
ever
learns
to
drive
like
a
well
now
there
some
mighty
good
woman
oh
of
course
these
women
that
try
to
imitate
men
and
play
golf
and
everything
and
ruin
their
complexions
and
spoil
their
hands
that
so
i
never
did
like
these
mannish
i
mean
of
course
i
admire
them
dreadfully
and
i
feel
so
weak
and
useless
beside
oh
rats
now
i
bet
you
play
the
piano
like
a
oh
no
i
mean
not
well
i
bet
you
do
he
glanced
at
her
smooth
hands
her
diamond
and
ruby
rings
she
caught
the
glance
snuggled
her
hands
together
with
a
kittenish
curving
of
slim
white
fingers
which
delighted
him
and
yearned
i
do
love
to
play
i
mean
i
like
to
drum
on
the
piano
but
i
had
any
real
training
judique
used
to
say
i
would
been
a
good
pianist
if
i
had
any
training
but
then
i
guess
he
was
just
flattering
i
bet
he
was
i
bet
you
got
oh
do
you
like
music
mr
babbitt
you
bet
i
do
only
i
do
know
i
care
so
much
for
all
this
classical
oh
i
do
i
just
love
chopin
and
all
do
you
honest
well
of
course
i
go
to
lots
of
these
highbrow
concerts
but
i
do
like
a
good
jazz
orchestra
right
up
on
its
toes
with
the
fellow
that
plays
the
bass
fiddle
spinning
it
around
and
beating
it
up
with
the
oh
i
know
i
do
love
good
dance
music
i
love
to
dance
do
you
babbitt
sure
you
bet
not
that
i
very
darn
good
at
it
oh
i
sure
you
are
you
ought
to
let
me
teach
you
i
can
teach
anybody
to
would
you
give
me
a
lesson
some
time
indeed
i
better
be
careful
or
i
be
taking
you
up
on
that
proposition
be
coming
up
to
your
flat
and
making
you
give
me
that
she
was
not
offended
but
she
was
he
warned
himself
have
some
sense
now
you
chump
do
go
making
a
fool
of
yourself
again
and
with
loftiness
he
discoursed
i
wish
i
could
dance
like
some
of
these
young
fellows
but
i
tell
you
i
feel
it
a
man
place
to
take
a
full
you
might
say
a
creative
share
in
the
world
work
and
mold
conditions
and
have
something
to
show
for
his
life
do
you
think
so
oh
i
do
and
so
i
have
to
sacrifice
some
of
the
things
i
might
like
to
tackle
though
i
do
by
golly
play
about
as
good
a
game
of
golf
as
the
next
fellow
oh
i
sure
you
do
are
you
married
uh
yes
and
uh
of
course
official
duties
i
the
of
the
boosters
club
and
i
running
one
of
the
committees
of
the
state
association
of
real
estate
boards
and
that
means
a
lot
of
work
and
responsibility
and
practically
no
gratitude
for
oh
i
know
public
men
never
do
get
proper
they
looked
at
each
other
with
a
high
degree
of
mutual
respect
and
at
the
cavendish
apartments
he
helped
her
out
in
a
courtly
manner
waved
his
hand
at
the
house
as
though
he
were
presenting
it
to
her
and
ponderously
ordered
the
elevator
boy
to
hustle
and
get
the
she
stood
close
to
him
in
the
elevator
and
he
was
stirred
but
cautious
it
was
a
pretty
flat
of
white
woodwork
and
soft
blue
walls
judique
gushed
with
pleasure
as
she
agreed
to
take
it
and
as
they
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
elevator
she
touched
his
sleeve
caroling
oh
i
so
glad
i
went
to
you
it
such
a
privilege
to
meet
a
man
who
really
understands
oh
the
flats
some
people
have
showed
me
he
had
a
sharp
instinctive
belief
that
he
could
put
his
arm
around
her
but
he
rebuked
himself
and
with
excessive
politeness
he
saw
her
to
the
car
drove
her
home
all
the
way
back
to
his
office
he
raged
glad
i
had
some
sense
for
once
curse
it
i
wish
i
tried
she
a
darling
a
corker
a
charmer
lovely
eyes
and
darling
lips
and
that
trim
waist
never
get
sloppy
like
some
women

real
cultured
lady

of
the
brightest
little
women
i
met
these
many
moons
understands
about
public
topics
and
but
darn
it
why
did
i
try
tanis
iii
he
was
harassed
and
puzzled
by
it
but
he
found
that
he
was
turning
toward
youth
as
youth
the
girl
who
especially
disturbed
him
though
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
was
the
last
manicure
girl
on
the
right
in
the
pompeian
barber
shop
she
was
small
swift
smiling
she
was
nineteen
perhaps
or
twenty
she
wore
thin
blouses
which
exhibited
her
shoulders
and
her
camisoles
he
went
to
the
pompeian
for
his
fortnightly
as
always
he
felt
disloyal
at
deserting
his
neighbor
the
reeves
building
barber
shop
then
for
the
first
time
he
overthrew
his
sense
of
guilt
doggone
it
i
do
have
to
go
here
if
i
do
want
to
i
do
own
the
reeves

by
people
unless
i
want
to
it

get
you
anywhere
i
through
the
pompeian
barber
shop
was
in
the
basement
of
the
hotel
thornleigh
largest
and
most
dynamically
modern
hotel
in
zenith
curving
marble
steps
with
a
rail
of
polished
brass
led
from
the
down
to
the
barber
shop
the
interior
was
of
black
and
white
and
crimson
tiles
with
a
sensational
ceiling
of
burnished
gold
and
a
fountain
in
which
a
massive
nymph
forever
emptied
a
scarlet
cornucopia
forty
barbers
and
nine
manicure
girls
worked
desperately
and
at
the
door
six
colored
porters
lurked
to
greet
the
customers
to
care
reverently
for
their
hats
and
collars
to
lead
them
to
a
place
of
waiting
where
on
a
carpet
like
a
tropic
isle
in
the
stretch
of
white
stone
floor
were
a
dozen
leather
chairs
and
a
table
heaped
with
magazines
babbitt
porter
was
an
obsequious
negro
who
did
him
an
honor
highly
esteemed
in
the
land
of
zenith
greeted
him
by
name
yet
babbitt
was
unhappy
his
bright
particular
manicure
girl
was
engaged
she
was
doing
the
nails
of
an
overdressed
man
and
giggling
with
him
babbitt
hated
him
he
thought
of
waiting
but
to
stop
the
powerful
system
of
the
pompeian
was
inconceivable
and
he
was
instantly
wafted
into
a
chair
about
him
was
luxury
rich
and
delicate
one
votary
was
having
a
facial
treatment
the
next
an
oil
shampoo
boys
wheeled
about
miraculous
electrical
the
barbers
snatched
steaming
towels
from
a
machine
like
a
howitzer
of
polished
nickel
and
disdainfully
flung
them
away
after
a
second
use
on
the
vast
marble
shelf
facing
the
chairs
were
hundreds
of
tonics
amber
and
ruby
and
emerald
it
was
flattering
to
babbitt
to
have
two
personal
slaves
at
once
the
barber
and
the
bootblack
he
would
have
been
completely
happy
if
he
could
also
have
had
the
manicure
girl
the
barber
snipped
at
his
hair
and
asked
his
opinion
of
the
havre
de
grace
races
the
baseball
season
and
mayor
prout
the
young
negro
bootblack
hummed
the
camp
meeting
blues
and
polished
in
rhythm
to
his
tune
drawing
the
shiny
so
taut
at
each
stroke
that
it
snapped
like
a
banjo
string
the
barber
was
an
excellent
salesman
he
made
babbitt
feel
rich
and
important
by
his
manner
of
inquiring
what
is
your
favorite
tonic
sir
have
you
time
sir
for
a
facial
massage
your
scalp
is
a
little
tight
shall
i
give
you
a
scalp
massage
babbitt
best
thrill
was
in
the
shampoo
the
barber
made
his
hair
creamy
with
thick
soap
then
as
babbitt
bent
over
the
bowl
muffled
in
towels
drenched
it
with
hot
water
which
prickled
along
his
scalp
and
at
last
ran
the
water
at
the
shock
the
sudden
burning
cold
on
his
skull
babbitt
heart
thumped
his
chest
heaved
and
his
spine
was
an
electric
wire
it
was
a
sensation
which
broke
the
monotony
of
life
he
looked
grandly
about
the
shop
as
he
sat
up
the
barber
obsequiously
rubbed
his
wet
hair
and
bound
it
in
a
towel
as
in
a
turban
so
that
babbitt
resembled
a
plump
pink
calif
on
an
ingenious
and
adjustable
throne
the
barber
begged
in
the
manner
of
one
who
was
a
good
fellow
yet
was
overwhelmed
by
the
splendors
of
the
calif
how
about
a
little
eldorado
oil
rub
sir
very
beneficial
to
the
scalp
sir
did
i
give
you
one
the
last
time
he
had
but
babbitt
agreed
well
all
with
quaking
eagerness
he
saw
that
his
manicure
girl
was
free
i
do
know
i
guess
i
have
a
manicure
after
all
he
droned
and
excitedly
watched
her
coming
smiling
tender
little
the
manicuring
would
have
to
be
finished
at
her
table
and
he
would
be
able
to
talk
to
her
without
the
barber
listening
he
waited
contentedly
not
trying
to
peep
at
her
while
she
filed
his
nails
and
the
barber
shaved
him
and
smeared
on
his
burning
cheeks
all
the
interesting
mixtures
which
the
pleasant
minds
of
barbers
have
devised
through
the
revolving
ages
when
the
barber
was
done
and
he
sat
opposite
the
girl
at
her
table
he
admired
the
marble
slab
of
it
admired
the
sunken
set
bowl
with
its
tiny
silver
taps
and
admired
himself
for
being
able
to
frequent
so
costly
a
place
when
she
withdrew
his
wet
hand
from
the
bowl
it
was
so
sensitive
from
the
warm
soapy
water
that
he
was
abnormally
aware
of
the
clasp
of
her
firm
little
paw
he
delighted
in
the
pinkness
and
glossiness
of
her
nails
her
hands
seemed
to
him
more
adorable
than
judique
thin
fingers
and
more
elegant
he
had
a
certain
ecstasy
in
the
pain
when
she
gnawed
at
the
cuticle
of
his
nails
with
a
sharp
knife
he
struggled
not
to
look
at
the
outline
of
her
young
bosom
and
her
shoulders
the
more
apparent
under
a
film
of
pink
chiffon
he
was
conscious
of
her
as
an
exquisite
thing
and
when
he
tried
to
impress
his
personality
on
her
he
spoke
as
awkwardly
as
a
country
boy
at
his
first
party
well
kinda
hot
to
be
working
oh
yes
it
is
hot
you
cut
your
own
nails
last
time
did
you
guess
i
must
you
always
ought
to
go
to
a
yes
maybe
that
so
i
there
nothing
looks
so
nice
as
nails
that
are
looked
after
good
i
always
think
that
the
best
way
to
spot
a
real
gent
there
was
an
auto
salesman
in
here
yesterday
that
claimed
you
could
always
tell
a
class
by
the
car
he
drove
but
i
says
to
him
be
silly
i
says
wisenheimers
grab
a
look
at
a
fellow
nails
when
they
want
to
tell
if
he
a
or
a
real
gent
yes
maybe
there
something
to
that
course
that
is
with
a
pretty
kiddy
like
you
a
man
ca
help
coming
to
get
his
mitts
yeh
i
may
be
a
kid
but
i
a
wise
bird
and
i
know
nice
folks
when
i
see
um
i
can
read
character
at
a
glance
and
i
never
talk
so
frank
with
a
fellow
if
i
could
see
he
was
a
nice
she
smiled
her
eyes
seemed
to
him
as
gentle
as
april
pools
with
great
seriousness
he
informed
himself
that
there
were
some
roughnecks
who
would
think
that
just
because
a
girl
was
a
manicure
girl
and
maybe
not
awful
well
educated
she
was
no
good
but
as
for
him
he
was
a
democrat
and
understood
people
and
he
stood
by
the
assertion
that
this
was
a
fine
girl
a
good
girl
but
not
too
uncomfortably
good
he
inquired
in
a
voice
quick
with
sympathy
i
suppose
you
have
a
lot
of
fellows
who
try
to
get
fresh
with
say
gee
do
i
say
listen
there
some
of
these
sports
that
think
because
a
girl
working
in
a
barber
shop
they
can
get
away
with
anything
the
things
they
saaaaaay
but
believe
me
i
know
how
to
hop
those
birds
i
just
give
um
the
north
and
south
and
ask
um
who
do
you
think
you
talking
to
and
they
fade
away
like
young
nightmare
and
oh
do
you
want
a
box
of
it
will
keep
the
nails
as
shiny
as
when
first
manicured
harmless
to
apply
and
lasts
for
sure
i
try
some
say

broker

course

i

much
time
to
read
but
i
guess
you
think
an
awfully
silly
little
nit
i
think
you
a
little
darling
well
there
one
nice
thing
about
this
job
it
gives
a
girl
a
chance
to
meet
some
awfully
nice
gentlemen
and
improve
her
mind
with
conversation
and
you
get
so
you
can
read
a
guy
character
at
the
first
look
here
ida
please
do
think
i
getting
fresh
he
was
hotly
reflecting
that
it
would
be
humiliating
to
be
rejected
by
this
child
and
dangerous
to
be
accepted
if
he
took
her
to
dinner
if
he
were
seen
by
censorious
friends
but
he
went
on
ardently
do
think
i
getting
fresh
if
i
suggest
it
would
be
nice
for
us
to
go
out
and
have
a
little
dinner
together
some
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
but
my
always
wanting
to
take
me
out
but
maybe
i
could
iv
there
was
no
reason
he
assured
himself
why
he
should
have
a
quiet
dinner
with
a
poor
girl
who
would
benefit
by
association
with
an
educated
and
mature
person
like
himself
but
lest
some
one
see
them
and
not
understand
he
would
take
her
to
biddlemeier
inn
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
they
would
have
a
pleasant
drive
this
hot
lonely
evening
and
he
might
hold
her
hand
no
he
would
even
do
that
ida
was
complaisant
her
bare
shoulders
showed
it
only
too
clearly
but
he
be
hanged
if
he
make
love
to
her
merely
because
she
expected
it
then
his
car
broke
down
something
had
happened
to
the
ignition
and
he
had
to
have
the
car
this
evening
furiously
he
tested
the
stared
at
the
commutator
his
angriest
glower
did
not
seem
to
stir
the
sulky
car
and
in
disgrace
it
was
hauled
off
to
a
garage
with
a
renewed
thrill
he
thought
of
a
taxicab
there
was
something
at
once
wealthy
and
interestingly
wicked
about
a
taxicab
but
when
he
met
her
on
a
corner
two
blocks
from
the
hotel
thornleigh
she
said
a
taxi
why
i
thought
you
owned
a
car
i
do
of
course
i
do
but
it
out
of
commission
oh
she
remarked
as
one
who
had
heard
that
tale
before
all
the
way
out
to
biddlemeier
inn
he
tried
to
talk
as
an
old
friend
but
he
could
not
pierce
the
wall
of
her
words
with
interminable
indignation
she
narrated
her
retorts
to
that
fresh
and
the
drastic
things
she
would
do
to
him
if
he
persisted
in
saying
that
she
was
better
at
gassing
than
at
at
biddlemeier
inn
they
were
unable
to
get
anything
to
drink
the
refused
to
understand
who
george
babbitt
was
they
sat
steaming
before
a
vast
mixed
grill
and
made
conversation
about
baseball
when
he
tried
to
hold
ida
hand
she
said
with
bright
friendliness
careful
that
fresh
waiter
is
but
they
came
out
into
a
treacherous
summer
night
the
air
lazy
and
a
little
moon
above
transfigured
maples
let
drive
some
other
place
where
we
can
get
a
drink
and
dance
he
demanded
sure
some
other
night
but
i
promised
ma
i
be
home
early
rats
it
too
nice
to
go
i
just
love
to
but
ma
would
give
me
he
was
trembling
she
was
everything
that
was
young
and
exquisite
he
put
his
arm
about
her
she
snuggled
against
his
shoulder
unafraid
and
he
was
triumphant
then
she
ran
down
the
steps
of
the
inn
singing
come
on
georgie
we
have
a
nice
drive
and
get
it
was
a
night
of
lovers
all
along
the
highway
into
zenith
under
the
low
and
gentle
moon
motors
were
parked
and
dim
figures
were
clasped
in
revery
he
held
out
hungry
hands
to
ida
and
when
she
patted
them
he
was
grateful
there
was
no
sense
of
struggle
and
transition
he
kissed
her
and
simply
she
responded
to
his
kiss
they
two
behind
the
stolid
back
of
the
chauffeur
her
hat
fell
off
and
she
broke
from
his
embrace
to
reach
for
it
oh
let
it
be
he
implored
huh
my
hat
not
a
chance
he
waited
till
she
had
pinned
it
on
then
his
arm
sank
about
her
she
drew
away
from
it
and
said
with
maternal
soothing
now
do
be
a
silly
boy
must
make
ittle
mama
scold
just
sit
back
dearie
and
see
what
a
swell
night
it
is
if
you

good
boy
maybe
i
kiss
you
when
we
say
now
give
me
a
he
was
solicitous
about
lighting
her
cigarette
and
inquiring
as
to
her
comfort
then
he
sat
as
far
from
her
as
possible
he
was
cold
with
failure
no
one
could
have
told
babbitt
that
he
was
a
fool
with
more
vigor
precision
and
intelligence
than
he
himself
displayed
he
reflected
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
rev
john
jennison
drew
he
was
a
wicked
man
and
from
the
standpoint
of
miss
ida
putiak
an
old
bore
who
had
to
be
endured
as
the
penalty
attached
to
eating
a
large
dinner
dearie
you
are
going
to
go
and
get
peevish
are
you
she
spoke
pertly
he
wanted
to
spank
her
he
brooded
i
do
have
to
take
anything
off
this
darn
immigrant
well
let
get
it
over
as
quick
as
we
can
and
sneak
home
and
kick
ourselves
for
the
rest
of
the
he
snorted
huh
me
peevish
why
you
baby
why
should
i
be
peevish
now
listen
ida
listen
to
uncle
george
i
want
to
put
you
wise
about
this
scrapping
with
your
all
the
time
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
employees
and
let
me
tell
you
it
does
pay
to
antagonize
at
the
drab
wooden
house
in
which
she
lived
he
said
briefly
and
amiably
but
as
the
taxicab
drove
off
he
was
praying
oh
my
god
chapter
xxv
i
he
awoke
to
stretch
cheerfully
as
he
listened
to
the
sparrows
then
to
remember
that
everything
was
wrong
that
he
was
determined
to
go
astray
and
not
in
the
least
enjoying
the
process
why
he
wondered
should
he
be
in
rebellion
what
was
it
all
about
why
not
be
sensible
stop
all
this
idiotic
running
around
and
enjoy
himself
with
his
family
his
business
the
fellows
at
the
club
what
was
he
getting
out
of
rebellion
misery
and
shame
the
shame
of
being
treated
as
an
offensive
small
boy
by
a
ragamuffin
like
ida
putiak
and
yet
always
he
came
back
to
and
whatever
the
misery
he
could
not
regain
contentment
with
a
world
which
once
doubted
became
absurd
only
he
assured
himself
he
was
through
with
this
chasing
after
by
noontime
he
was
not
so
sure
even
of
that
if
in
miss
mcgoun
louetta
swanson
and
ida
he
had
failed
to
find
the
lady
kind
and
lovely
it
did
not
prove
that
she
did
not
exist
he
was
hunted
by
the
ancient
thought
that
somewhere
must
exist
the
not
impossible
she
who
would
understand
him
value
him
and
make
him
happy
ii
babbitt
returned
in
august
on
her
previous
absences
he
had
missed
her
reassuring
buzz
and
of
her
arrival
he
had
made
a
fête
now
though
he
dared
not
hurt
her
by
letting
a
hint
of
it
appear
in
his
letters
he
was
sorry
that
she
was
coming
before
he
had
found
himself
and
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
need
of
meeting
her
and
looking
joyful
he
loitered
down
to
the
station
he
studied
the
posters
lest
he
have
to
speak
to
acquaintances
and
expose
his
uneasiness
but
he
was
well
trained
when
the
train
clanked
in
he
was
out
on
the
cement
platform
peering
into
the
and
as
he
saw
her
in
the
line
of
passengers
moving
toward
the
vestibule
he
waved
his
hat
at
the
door
he
embraced
her
and
announced
well
well
well
well
by
golly
you
look
fine
you
look
then
he
was
aware
of
tinka
here
was
something
this
child
with
her
absurd
little
nose
and
lively
eyes
that
loved
him
believed
him
great
and
as
he
clasped
her
lifted
and
held
her
till
she
squealed
he
was
for
the
moment
come
back
to
his
old
steady
self
tinka
sat
beside
him
in
the
car
with
one
hand
on
the
pretending
to
help
him
drive
and
he
shouted
back
to
his
wife
i
bet
the
kid
will
be
the
best
chuffer
in
the
family
she
holds
the
wheel
like
an
old
professional
all
the
while
he
was
dreading
the
moment
when
he
would
be
alone
with
his
wife
and
she
would
patiently
expect
him
to
be
ardent
iii
there
was
about
the
house
an
unofficial
theory
that
he
was
to
take
his
vacation
alone
to
spend
a
week
or
ten
days
in
catawba
but
he
was
nagged
by
the
memory
that
a
year
ago
he
had
been
with
paul
in
maine
he
saw
himself
returning
finding
peace
there
and
the
presence
of
paul
in
a
life
primitive
and
heroic
like
a
shock
came
the
thought
that
he
actually
could
go
only
he
could
really
he
could
leave
his
business
and
myra
would
think
it
sort
of
funny
his
going
way
off
there
alone
course
he
decided
to
do
whatever
he
darned
pleased
from
now
on
but
still
to
go
way
off
to
maine
he
went
after
lengthy
meditations
with
his
wife
since
it
was
inconceivable
to
explain
that
he
was
going
to
seek
paul
spirit
in
the
wilderness
he
frugally
employed
the
lie
prepared
over
a
year
ago
and
scarcely
used
at
all
he
said
that
he
had
to
see
a
man
in
new
york
on
business
he
could
not
have
explained
even
to
himself
why
he
drew
from
the
bank
several
hundred
dollars
more
than
he
needed
nor
why
he
kissed
tinka
so
tenderly
and
cried
god
bless
you
baby
from
the
train
he
waved
to
her
till
she
was
but
a
scarlet
spot
beside
the
brown
bulkier
presence
of
babbitt
at
the
end
of
a
steel
and
cement
aisle
ending
in
vast
barred
gates
with
melancholy
he
looked
back
at
the
last
suburb
of
zenith
all
the
way
north
he
pictured
the
maine
guides
simple
and
strong
and
daring
jolly
as
they
played
in
their
unceiled
shack
wise
in
woodcraft
as
they
tramped
the
forest
and
shot
the
rapids
he
particularly
remembered
joe
paradise
half
yankee
half
indian
if
he
could
but
take
up
a
backwoods
claim
with
a
man
like
joe
work
hard
with
his
hands
be
free
and
noisy
in
a
flannel
shirt
and
never
come
back
to
this
dull
decency
or
like
a
trapper
in
a
northern
canada
movie
plunge
through
the
forest
make
camp
in
the
rockies
a
grim
and
wordless
caveman
why
not
he
could
do
it
there
be
enough
money
at
home
for
the
family
to
live
on
till
verona
was
married
and
ted
old
henry
would
look
out
for
them
honestly
why
not
really
live
he
longed
for
it
admitted
that
he
longed
for
it
then
almost
believed
that
he
was
going
to
do
it
whenever
common
sense
snorted
nonsense
folks
do
run
away
from
decent
families
and
partners
just
simply
do
do
it
that
all
then
babbitt
answered
pleadingly
well
it
would
take
any
more
nerve
than
for
paul
to
go
to
jail
and
lord
how
i
like
to
do
it
moccasins
frontier
town
gamblers
sleep
under
the
stars
be
a
regular
man
with
like
joe
paradise
gosh
so
he
came
to
maine
again
stood
on
the
wharf
before
the
again
spat
heroically
into
the
delicate
and
shivering
water
while
the
pines
rustled
the
mountains
glowed
and
a
trout
leaped
and
fell
in
a
sliding
circle
he
hurried
to
the
guides
shack
as
to
his
real
home
his
real
friends
long
missed
they
would
be
glad
to
see
him
they
would
stand
up
and
shout
why
here
babbitt
he
ai
one
of
these
ordinary
sports
he
a
real
guy
in
their
boarded
and
rather
littered
cabin
the
guides
sat
about
the
greasy
table
playing
with
greasy
cards
half
a
dozen
wrinkled
men
in
old
trousers
and
easy
old
felt
hats
they
glanced
up
and
nodded
joe
paradise
the
swart
aging
man
with
the
big
mustache
grunted
how
do
back
again
silence
except
for
the
clatter
of
chips
babbitt
stood
beside
them
very
lonely
he
hinted
after
a
period
of
highly
concentrated
playing
guess
i
might
take
a
hand
sure
sit
in
how
many
chips
you
want
let
see
you
were
here
with
your
wife
last
year
you
said
joe
paradise
that
was
all
of
babbitt
welcome
to
the
old
home
he
played
for
half
an
hour
before
he
spoke
again
his
head
was
reeking
with
the
smoke
of
pipes
and
cheap
cigars
and
he
was
weary
of
pairs
and
resentful
of
the
way
in
which
they
ignored
him
he
flung
at
joe
working
now
like
to
guide
me
for
a
few
days
well
jus
soon
i
ai
engaged
till
next
only
thus
did
joe
recognize
the
friendship
babbitt
was
offering
him
babbitt
paid
up
his
losses
and
left
the
shack
rather
childishly
joe
raised
his
head
from
the
coils
of
smoke
like
a
seal
rising
from
surf
grunted
i
come
and
dived
down
to
his
three
aces
neither
in
his
voiceless
cabin
fragrant
with
planks
of
pine
nor
along
the
lake
nor
in
the
sunset
clouds
which
presently
eddied
behind
the
mountains
could
babbitt
find
the
spirit
of
paul
as
a
reassuring
presence
he
was
so
lonely
that
after
supper
he
stopped
to
talk
with
an
ancient
old
lady
a
gasping
and
steadily
discoursing
old
lady
by
the
stove
in
the
he
told
her
of
ted
presumable
future
triumphs
in
the
state
university
and
of
remarkable
vocabulary
till
he
was
homesick
for
the
home
he
had
left
forever
through
the
darkness
through
that
northern
silence
he
blundered
down
to
the
and
found
a
canoe
there
were
no
paddles
in
it
but
with
a
board
sitting
awkwardly
amidships
and
poking
at
the
water
rather
than
paddling
he
made
his
way
far
out
on
the
lake
the
lights
of
the
hotel
and
the
cottages
became
yellow
dots
a
cluster
of
at
the
base
of
sachem
mountain
larger
and
ever
more
imperturbable
was
the
mountain
in
the
darkness
and
the
lake
a
limitless
pavement
of
black
marble
he
was
dwarfed
and
dumb
and
a
little
awed
but
that
insignificance
freed
him
from
the
pomposities
of
being
george
babbitt
of
zenith
saddened
and
freed
his
heart
now
he
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
paul
fancied
him
rescued
from
prison
from
zilla
and
the
brisk
exactitudes
of
the
business
playing
his
violin
at
the
end
of
the
canoe
he
vowed
i
will
go
on
i
never
go
back
now
that
paul
out
of
it
i
do
want
to
see
any
of
those
damn
people
again
i
was
a
fool
to
get
sore
because
joe
paradise
did
jump
up
and
hug
me
he
one
of
these
woodsmen
too
wise
to
go
yelping
and
talking
your
arm
off
like
a
cityman
but
get
him
back
in
the
mountains
out
on
the
trail
that
real
living
iv
joe
reported
at
babbitt
cabin
at
nine
the
next
morning
babbitt
greeted
him
as
a
fellow
caveman
well
joe
how
d
you
feel
about
hitting
the
trail
and
getting
away
from
these
darn
soft
summerites
and
these
women
and
all
all
right
what
do
you
say
we
go
over
to
box
car
pond
they
tell
me
the
shack
there
is
being
used
and
camp
out
well
all
right
babbitt
but
it
nearer
to
skowtuit
pond
and
you
can
get
just
about
as
good
fishing
no
i
want
to
get
into
the
real
well
all
we
put
the
old
packs
on
our
backs
and
get
into
the
woods
and
really
i
think
maybe
it
would
be
easier
to
go
by
water
through
lake
chogue
we
can
go
all
the
way
by
motor
boat
boat
with
an
no
sir
bust
up
the
quiet
with
a
chugging
motor
not
on
your
life
you
just
throw
a
pair
of
socks
in
the
old
pack
and
tell
what
you
want
for
eats
i
be
ready
soon
you
most
of
the
sports
go
by
boat
babbitt
it
a
long
walk
look
here
joe
are
you
objecting
to
walking
oh
no
i
guess
i
can
do
it
but
i
have
tramped
that
far
for
sixteen
years
most
of
the
sports
go
by
boat
but
i
can
do
it
if
you
say
so
i
joe
walked
away
in
sadness
babbitt
had
recovered
from
his
touchy
wrath
before
joe
returned
he
pictured
him
as
warming
up
and
telling
the
most
entertaining
stories
but
joe
had
not
yet
warmed
up
when
they
took
the
trail
he
persistently
kept
behind
babbitt
and
however
much
his
shoulders
ached
from
the
pack
however
sorely
he
panted
babbitt
could
hear
his
guide
panting
equally
but
the
trail
was
satisfying
a
path
brown
with
and
rough
with
roots
among
the
balsams
the
ferns
the
sudden
groves
of
white
birch
he
became
credulous
again
and
rejoiced
in
sweating
when
he
stopped
to
rest
he
chuckled
guess
we
hitting
it
up
pretty
good
for
a
couple
o
old
birds
eh
admitted
joe
this
is
a
mighty
pretty
place
look
you
can
see
the
lake
down
through
the
trees
i
tell
you
joe
you
do
appreciate
how
lucky
you
are
to
live
in
woods
like
this
instead
of
a
city
with
trolleys
grinding
and
typewriters
clacking
and
people
bothering
the
life
out
of
you
all
the
time
i
wish
i
knew
the
woods
like
you
do
say
what
the
name
of
that
little
red
flower
rubbing
his
back
joe
regarded
the
flower
resentfully
well
some
folks
call
it
one
thing
and
some
calls
it
another
i
always
just
call
it
pink
babbitt
blessedly
ceased
thinking
as
tramping
turned
into
blind
plodding
he
was
submerged
in
weariness
his
plump
legs
seemed
to
go
on
by
themselves
without
guidance
and
he
mechanically
wiped
away
the
sweat
which
stung
his
eyes
he
was
too
tired
to
be
consciously
glad
as
after
a
mile
of
corduroy
through
a
swamp
where
flies
hovered
over
a
hot
waste
of
brush
they
reached
the
cool
shore
of
box
car
pond
when
he
lifted
the
pack
from
his
back
he
staggered
from
the
change
in
balance
and
for
a
moment
could
not
stand
erect
he
lay
beneath
an
maple
tree
near
the
and
joyously
felt
sleep
running
through
his
veins
he
awoke
toward
dusk
to
find
joe
efficiently
cooking
bacon
and
eggs
and
flapjacks
for
supper
and
his
admiration
of
the
woodsman
returned
he
sat
on
a
stump
and
felt
virile
joe
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
a
lot
of
money
would
you
stick
to
guiding
or
would
you
take
a
claim
back
in
the
woods
and
be
independent
of
people
for
the
first
time
joe
brightened
he
chewed
his
cud
a
second
and
bubbled
i
often
thought
of
that
if
i
had
the
money
i
go
down
to
tinker
falls
and
open
a
swell
shoe
after
supper
joe
proposed
a
game
of
but
babbitt
refused
with
brevity
and
joe
contentedly
went
to
bed
at
eight
babbitt
sat
on
the
stump
facing
the
dark
pond
slapping
mosquitos
save
the
snoring
guide
there
was
no
other
human
being
within
ten
miles
he
was
lonelier
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
then
he
was
in
zenith
he
was
worrying
as
to
whether
miss
mcgoun
was
paying
too
much
for
carbon
paper
he
was
at
once
resenting
and
missing
the
persistent
teasing
at
the
roughnecks
table
he
was
wondering
what
zilla
riesling
was
doing
now
he
was
wondering
whether
after
the
summer
maturity
of
being
a
garageman
ted
would
get
busy
in
the
university
he
was
thinking
of
his
wife
if
she
would
only
if
she
would
be
so
darn
satisfied
with
just
settling
down
no
i
wo
i
wo
go
back
be
fifty
in
three
years
sixty
in
thirteen
years
i
going
to
have
some
fun
before
it
too
late
i
do
care
i
will
he
thought
of
ida
putiak
of
louetta
swanson
of
that
nice
widow
what
was
her
name
tanis
judique
the
one
for
whom
he
found
the
flat
he
was
enmeshed
in
imaginary
conversations
then
gee
i
ca
seem
to
get
away
from
thinking
about
folks
thus
it
came
to
him
merely
to
run
away
was
folly
because
he
could
never
run
away
from
himself
that
moment
he
started
for
zenith
in
his
journey
there
was
no
appearance
of
flight
but
he
was
fleeing
and
four
days
afterward
he
was
on
the
zenith
train
he
knew
that
he
was
slinking
back
not
because
it
was
what
he
longed
to
do
but
because
it
was
all
he
could
do
he
scanned
again
his
discovery
that
he
could
never
run
away
from
zenith
and
family
and
office
because
in
his
own
brain
he
bore
the
office
and
the
family
and
every
street
and
disquiet
and
illusion
of
zenith
but
i
going
to
oh
i
going
to
start
something
he
vowed
and
he
tried
to
make
it
valiant
chapter
xxvi
i
as
he
walked
through
the
train
looking
for
familiar
faces
he
saw
only
one
person
whom
he
knew
and
that
was
seneca
doane
the
lawyer
who
after
the
blessings
of
being
in
babbitt
own
class
at
college
and
of
becoming
a
had
turned
crank
had
headed
tickets
and
fraternized
with
admitted
socialists
though
he
was
in
rebellion
naturally
babbitt
did
not
care
to
be
seen
talking
with
such
a
fanatic
but
in
all
the
pullmans
he
could
find
no
other
acquaintance
and
reluctantly
he
halted
seneca
doane
was
a
slight
man
rather
like
chum
frink
except
that
he
had
grin
he
was
reading
a
book
called
the
way
of
all
it
looked
religious
to
babbitt
and
he
wondered
if
doane
could
possibly
have
been
converted
and
turned
decent
and
patriotic
why
hello
doane
he
said
doane
looked
up
his
voice
was
curiously
kind
oh
how
do
been
away
eh
yes
i
been
in
washington
eh
how
the
old
government
making
out
it
wo
you
sit
down
thanks
do
care
if
i
do
well
well
been
quite
a
while
since
had
a
good
chance
to
talk
to
you
doane
i
was
uh
sorry
you
turn
up
at
the
last
oh
how
the
unions
coming
going
to
run
for
mayor
again
doane
seemed
restless
he
was
fingering
the
pages
of
his
book
he
said
i
might
as
though
it
did
mean
anything
in
particular
and
he
smiled
babbitt
liked
that
smile
and
hunted
for
conversation
saw
a
cabaret
in
new
york
the
cutie
bunch
at
the
hotel
yes
they
pretty
girls
i
danced
there
one
oh
like
dancing
naturally
i
like
dancing
and
pretty
women
and
good
food
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
most
men
but
gosh
doane
i
thought
you
fellows
wanted
to
take
all
the
good
eats
and
everything
away
from
no
not
at
all
what
i
like
to
see
is
the
meetings
of
the
garment
workers
held
at
the
ritz
with
a
dance
afterward
is
that
reasonable
yuh
might
be
good
idea
all
right
well
shame
i
have
seen
more
of
you
recent
years
oh
say
hope
you
have
held
it
against
me
my
bucking
you
as
mayor
going
on
the
stump
for
prout
you
see
i
an
organization
republican
and
i
kind
of
felt
there
no
reason
why
you
should
fight
me
i
have
no
doubt
good
for
the
organization
i
remember
in
college
you
were
an
unusually
liberal
sensitive
chap
i
can
still
recall
your
saying
to
me
that
you
were
going
to
be
a
lawyer
and
take
the
cases
of
the
poor
for
nothing
and
fight
the
rich
and
i
remember
i
said
i
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
rich
myself
and
buy
paintings
and
live
at
newport
i
sure
you
inspired
us
well
well
i
always
aimed
to
be
babbitt
was
enormously
shy
and
proud
and
he
tried
to
look
like
the
boy
he
had
been
a
ago
and
he
shone
upon
his
old
friend
seneca
doane
as
he
rumbled
trouble
with
a
lot
of
these
fellows
even
the
live
wires
and
some
of
that
think
they
is
they
are
and
liberal
now
i
always
believe
in
giving
the
other
fellow
a
chance
and
listening
to
his
that
tell
you
how
i
figure
it
a
little
opposition
is
good
for
all
of
us
so
a
fellow
especially
if
he
a
business
man
and
engaged
in
doing
the
work
of
the
world
ought
to
be
yes
i
always
say
a
fellow
ought
to
have
vision
and
ideals
i
guess
some
of
the
fellows
in
my
business
think
i
pretty
visionary
but
i
just
let
think
what
they
want
to
and
go
right
on
same
as
you
do
by
golly
this
is
nice
to
have
a
chance
to
sit
and
visit
and
kind
of
you
might
say
brush
up
on
our
but
of
course
we
visionaries
do
rather
get
beaten
does
it
bother
you
not
a
bit
nobody
can
dictate
to
me
what
i
think
you
the
man
i
want
to
help
me
i
want
you
to
talk
to
some
of
the
business
men
and
try
to
make
them
a
little
more
liberal
in
their
attitude
toward
poor
beecher
ingram
but
why
he
this
nut
preacher
that
got
kicked
out
of
the
congregationalist
church
is
he
and
preaches
free
love
and
sedition
this
doane
explained
was
indeed
the
general
conception
of
beecher
ingram
but
he
himself
saw
beecher
ingram
as
a
priest
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
of
which
babbitt
was
notoriously
an
upholder
so
would
babbitt
keep
his
acquaintances
from
hounding
ingram
and
his
forlorn
little
church
you
bet
i
call
down
any
of
the
boys
i
hear
getting
funny
about
ingram
babbitt
said
affectionately
to
his
dear
friend
doane
doane
warmed
up
and
became
reminiscent
he
spoke
of
student
days
in
germany
of
lobbying
for
single
tax
in
washington
of
international
labor
conferences
he
mentioned
his
friends
lord
wycombe
colonel
wedgwood
professor
piccoli
babbitt
had
always
supposed
that
doane
associated
only
with
the
but
now
he
nodded
gravely
as
one
who
knew
lord
wycombes
by
the
score
and
he
got
in
two
references
to
sir
gerald
doak
he
felt
daring
and
idealistic
and
cosmopolitan
suddenly
in
his
new
spiritual
grandeur
he
was
sorry
for
zilla
riesling
and
understood
her
as
these
ordinary
fellows
at
the
club
never
could
ii
five
hours
after
he
had
arrived
in
zenith
and
told
his
wife
how
hot
it
was
in
new
york
he
went
to
call
on
zilla
he
was
buzzing
with
ideas
and
forgiveness
he
get
paul
released
he
do
things
vague
but
highly
benevolent
things
for
zilla
he
be
as
generous
as
his
friend
seneca
doane
he
had
not
seen
zilla
since
paul
had
shot
her
and
he
still
pictured
her
as
buxom
lively
and
a
little
blowsy
as
he
drove
up
to
her
in
a
depressing
back
street
below
the
wholesale
district
he
stopped
in
discomfort
at
an
upper
window
leaning
on
her
elbow
was
a
woman
with
the
features
of
zilla
but
she
was
bloodless
and
aged
like
a
yellowed
wad
of
old
paper
crumpled
into
wrinkles
where
zilla
had
bounced
and
jiggled
this
woman
was
dreadfully
still
he
waited
half
an
hour
before
she
came
into
the
parlor
fifty
times
he
opened
the
book
of
photographs
of
the
chicago
fair
of
fifty
times
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
the
court
of
honor
he
was
startled
to
find
zilla
in
the
room
she
wore
a
black
streaky
gown
which
she
had
tried
to
brighten
with
a
girdle
of
crimson
ribbon
the
ribbon
had
been
torn
and
patiently
mended
he
noted
this
carefully
because
he
did
not
wish
to
look
at
her
shoulders
one
shoulder
was
lower
than
the
other
one
arm
she
carried
in
contorted
fashion
as
though
it
were
paralyzed
and
behind
a
high
collar
of
cheap
lace
there
was
a
gouge
in
the
anemic
neck
which
had
once
been
shining
and
softly
plump
yes
she
said
well
well
old
zilla
by
golly
it
good
to
see
you
again
he
can
send
his
messages
through
a
why
rats
zilla
i
did
come
just
because
of
him
came
as
an
old
you
waited
long
enough
well
you
know
how
it
is
figured
you
would
want
to
see
a
friend
of
his
for
quite
some
time
and
sit
down
honey
let
be
sensible
all
of
us
done
a
bunch
of
things
that
we
had
ought
to
but
maybe
we
can
sort
of
start
over
again
honest
zilla
i
like
to
do
something
to
make
you
both
happy
know
what
i
thought
mind
you
paul
know
a
thing
about
this
does
know
i
was
going
to
come
see
you
i
got
to
thinking
zilla
a
fine
woman
and
she
understand
that
uh
paul
had
his
lesson
now
why
would
it
be
a
fine
idea
if
you
asked
the
governor
to
pardon
him
believe
he
would
if
it
came
from
you
no
wait
just
think
how
good
you
feel
if
you
were
yes
i
wish
to
be
she
was
sitting
primly
speaking
icily
for
that
reason
i
wish
to
keep
him
in
prison
as
an
example
to
i
gotten
religion
george
since
the
terrible
thing
that
man
did
to
me
sometimes
i
used
to
be
unkind
and
i
wished
for
worldly
pleasures
for
dancing
and
the
theater
but
when
i
was
in
the
hospital
the
pastor
of
the
pentecostal
communion
faith
used
to
come
to
see
me
and
he
showed
me
right
from
the
prophecies
written
in
the
word
of
god
that
the
day
of
judgment
is
coming
and
all
the
members
of
the
older
churches
are
going
straight
to
eternal
damnation
because
they
only
do
and
swallow
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
for
fifteen
wild
minutes
she
talked
pouring
out
admonitions
to
flee
the
wrath
to
come
and
her
face
flushed
her
dead
voice
recaptured
something
of
the
shrill
energy
of
the
old
zilla
she
wound
up
with
a
furious
it
the
blessing
of
god
himself
that
paul
should
be
in
prison
now
and
torn
and
humbled
by
punishment
so
that
he
may
yet
save
his
soul
and
so
other
wicked
men
these
horrible
chasers
after
women
and
lust
may
have
an
babbitt
had
itched
and
twisted
as
in
church
he
dared
not
move
during
the
sermon
so
now
he
felt
that
he
must
seem
attentive
though
her
screeching
denunciations
flew
past
him
like
carrion
birds
he
sought
to
be
calm
and
brotherly
yes
i
know
zilla
but
gosh
it
certainly
is
the
essence
of
religion
to
be
charitable
is
it
let
me
tell
you
how
i
figure
it
what
we
need
in
the
world
is
liberalism
liberality
if
we
going
to
get
anywhere
i
always
believed
in
being
and
liberal
you
liberal
it
was
very
much
the
old
zilla
why
george
babbitt
you
about
as
and
liberal
as
a
oh
i
am
am
i
well
just
let
me
tell
you
just
let
me
tell
you
i
as
by
golly
liberal
as
you
are
religious
anyway
you
religious
i
am
so
our
pastor
says
i
sustain
him
in
the
faith
i
bet
you
do
with
paul
money
but
just
to
show
you
how
liberal
i
am
i
going
to
send
a
check
for
ten
bucks
to
this
beecher
ingram
because
a
lot
of
fellows
are
saying
the
poor
cuss
preaches
sedition
and
free
love
and
they
trying
to
run
him
out
of
and
they
right
they
ought
to
run
him
out
of
town
why
he
preaches
if
you
can
call
it
preaching
in
a
theater
in
the
house
of
satan
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
find
god
to
find
peace
to
behold
the
snares
that
the
devil
spreads
out
for
our
feet
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
the
mysterious
purposes
of
god
in
having
paul
harm
me
and
stop
my
wickedness
and
paul
getting
his
good
and
plenty
for
the
cruel
things
he
did
to
me
and
i
hope
he
dies
in
prison
babbitt
was
up
hat
in
hand
growling
well
if
that
what
you
call
being
at
peace
for
heaven
sake
just
warn
me
before
you
go
to
war
will
you
iii
vast
is
the
power
of
cities
to
reclaim
the
wanderer
more
than
mountains
or
the
sea
a
city
retains
its
character
imperturbable
cynical
holding
behind
apparent
changes
its
essential
purpose
though
babbitt
had
deserted
his
family
and
dwelt
with
joe
paradise
in
the
wilderness
though
he
had
become
a
liberal
though
he
had
been
quite
sure
on
the
night
before
he
reached
zenith
that
neither
he
nor
the
city
would
be
the
same
again
ten
days
after
his
return
he
could
not
believe
that
he
had
ever
been
away
nor
was
it
at
all
evident
to
his
acquaintances
that
there
was
a
new
george
babbitt
save
that
he
was
more
irritable
under
the
incessant
chaffing
at
the
athletic
club
and
once
when
vergil
gunch
observed
that
seneca
doane
ought
to
be
hanged
babbitt
snorted
oh
rats
he
not
so
at
home
he
grunted
eh
across
the
newspaper
to
his
commentatory
wife
and
was
delighted
by
tinka
new
red
tam
and
announced
no
class
to
that
corrugated
iron
garage
have
to
build
me
a
nice
frame
verona
and
kenneth
escott
appeared
really
to
be
engaged
in
his
newspaper
escott
had
conducted
a
crusade
against
as
a
result
he
had
been
given
an
excellent
job
in
a
and
he
was
making
a
salary
on
which
he
could
marry
and
denouncing
irresponsible
reporters
who
wrote
stories
criticizing
without
knowing
what
they
were
talking
about
this
september
ted
had
entered
the
state
university
as
a
freshman
in
the
college
of
arts
and
sciences
the
university
was
at
mohalis
only
fifteen
miles
from
zenith
and
ted
often
came
down
for
the
babbitt
was
worried
ted
was
going
in
for
everything
but
books
he
had
tried
to
make
the
football
team
as
a
light
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
season
he
was
on
the
committee
for
the
freshman
hop
and
as
a
zenithite
an
aristocrat
among
the
yokels
he
was
being
rushed
by
two
fraternities
but
of
his
studies
babbitt
could
learn
nothing
save
a
mumbled
oh
gosh
these
old
stiffs
of
teachers
just
give
you
a
lot
of
junk
about
literature
and
one
ted
proposed
say
dad
why
ca
i
transfer
over
from
the
college
to
the
school
of
engineering
and
take
mechanical
engineering
you
always
holler
that
i
never
study
but
honest
i
would
study
no
the
engineering
school
has
got
the
standing
the
college
has
fretted
babbitt
i
like
to
know
how
it
has
the
engineers
can
play
on
any
of
the
teams
there
was
much
explanation
of
the
value
of
being
known
as
a
college
man
when
you
go
into
the
law
and
a
truly
oratorical
account
of
the
lawyer
life
before
he
was
through
with
it
babbitt
had
ted
a
united
states
senator
among
the
great
lawyers
whom
he
mentioned
was
seneca
doane
but
gee
whiz
ted
marveled
i
thought
you
always
said
this
doane
was
a
nut
that
no
way
to
speak
of
a
great
man
doane
always
been
a
good
friend
of
mine
fact
i
helped
him
in
college
i
started
him
out
and
you
might
say
inspired
him
just
because
he
sympathetic
with
the
aims
of
labor
a
lot
of
chumps
that
lack
liberality
and
think
he
a
crank
but
let
me
tell
you
there
mighty
few
of
that
rake
in
the
fees
he
does
and
he
a
friend
of
some
of
the
strongest
most
conservative
men
in
the
world
like
lord
wycombe
this
uh
this
big
english
nobleman
that
so
well
known
and
you
now
which
would
you
rather
do
be
in
with
a
lot
of
greasy
mechanics
and
or
chum
up
to
a
real
fellow
like
lord
wycombe
and
get
invited
to
his
house
for
parties
well
gosh
sighed
ted
the
next
he
came
in
joyously
with
say
dad
why
could
i
take
mining
engineering
instead
of
the
academic
course
you
talk
about
standing
maybe
there
is
much
in
mechanical
engineering
but
the
miners
gee
they
got
seven
out
of
eleven
in
the
new
elections
to
nu
tau

chapter
xxvii
i
the
strike
which
turned
zenith
into
two
belligerent
camps
white
and
red
began
late
in
september
with
a
of
telephone
girls
and
linemen
in
protest
against
a
reduction
of
wages
the
newly
formed
union
of
workers
went
out
partly
in
sympathy
and
partly
in
demand
for
a
hour
week
they
were
followed
by
the
union
industry
was
tied
up
and
the
whole
city
was
nervous
with
talk
of
a
trolley
strike
a
printers
strike
a
general
strike
furious
citizens
trying
to
get
telephone
calls
through
girls
danced
helplessly

made
its

attacked

from

and
merry
man
who
told
stories
at
the

and
who
strangely
resembled
a
victorian
was
to
be
seen
as
a
waddling
but
ferocious
captain
with
his
belt
tight
about
his
comfortable
little
belly
and
his
round
little
mouth
petulant
as
he
piped
to
chattering
groups
on
corners
move
on
there
now
i
ca
have
any
of
this
loitering
every
newspaper
in
the
city
save
one
was
against
the
strikers
when
mobs
raided
the
at
each
was
stationed
a
militiaman
a
young
embarrassed
with
bookkeeper
or
in
private
life
trying
to
look
dangerous
while
small
boys
yelped
get
onto

tin
soldier
and
striking
inquired
tenderly
say
joe
when
i
was
fighting
in
france
was
you
in
camp
in
the
states
or
was
you
doing
swede
exercises
in
the
be
careful
of
that
bayonet
now
or
you
cut
yourself
there
was
no
one
in
zenith
who
talked
of
anything
but
the
strike
and
no
one
who
did
not
take
sides
you
were
either
a
courageous
friend
of
labor
or
you
were
a
fearless
supporter
of
the
rights
of
property
and
in
either
case
you
were
belligerent
and
ready
to
disown
any
friend
who
did
not
hate
the
enemy
a
plant
was
set
afire
each
side
charged
it
to
the
other
and
the
city
was
hysterical
and
babbitt
chose
this
time
to
be
publicly
liberal
he
belonged
to
the
sound
sane
wing
and
at
first
he
agreed
that
the
crooked
agitators
ought
to
be
shot
he
was
sorry
when
his
friend
seneca
doane
defended
arrested
strikers
and
he
thought
of
going
to
doane
and
explaining
about
these
agitators
but
when
he
read
a
broadside
alleging
that
even
on
their
former
wages
the
telephone
girls
had
been
hungry
he
was
troubled
all
lies
and
fake
figures
he
said
but
in
a
doubtful
croak
for
the
sunday
after
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
church
announced
a
sermon
by
john
jennison
drew
on
how
the
saviour
would
end
babbitt
had
been
negligent
about
lately
but
he
went
to
the
service
hopeful
that
drew
really
did
have
the
information
as
to
what
the
divine
powers
thought
about
strikes
beside
babbitt
in
the
large
curving
glossy
pew
was
chum
frink
frink
whispered
hope
the
doc
gives
the
strikers
hell
ordinarily
i
do
believe
in
a
preacher
butting
into
political
matters
let
him
stick
to
straight
religion
and
save
souls
and
not
stir
up
a
lot
of
discussion
but
at
a
time
like
this
i
do
think
he
ought
to
stand
right
up
and
bawl
out
those
to
a
yes
well
said
babbitt
the
rev
drew
his
rustic
bang
flopping
with
the
intensity
of
his
poetic
and
sociologic
ardor
trumpeted
during
the
untoward
series
of
industrial
dislocations
which
have
let
us
be
courageous
and
admit
it
boldly
throttled
the
business
life
of
our
fair
city
these
past
days
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
loose
talk
about
scientific
prevention
of
scientific
scientific
now
let
me
tell
you
that
the
most
unscientific
thing
in
the
world
is
science
take
the
attacks
on
the
established
fundamentals
of
the
christian
creed
which
were
so
popular
with
the
a
generation
ago
oh
yes
they
were
mighty
fellows
and
great
of
criticism
they
were
going
to
destroy
the
church
they
were
going
to
prove
the
world
was
created
and
has
been
brought
to
its
extraordinary
level
of
morality
and
civilization
by
blind
chance
yet
the
church
stands
just
as
firmly
as
ever
and
the
only
answer
a
christian
pastor
needs
make
to
the
opponents
of
his
simple
faith
is
just
a
pitying
smile
and
now
these
same
want
to
replace
the
natural
condition
of
free
competition
by
crazy
systems
which
no
matter
by
what
names
they
are
called
are
nothing
but
a
despotic
paternalism
naturally
i
not
criticizing
labor
courts
injunctions
against
men
proven
to
be
striking
unjustly
or
those
excellent
unions
in
which
the
men
and
the
boss
get
together
but
i
certainly
am
criticizing
the
systems
in
which
the
free
and
fluid
motivation
of
independent
labor
is
to
be
replaced
by
and
minimum
salaries
and
government
commissions
and
labor
federations
and
all
that
poppycock
what
is
not
generally
understood
is
that
this
whole
industrial
matter
is
a
question
of
economics
it
essentially
and
only
a
matter
of
love
and
of
the
practical
application
of
the
christian
religion
imagine
a
factory
instead
of
committees
of
workmen
alienating
the
boss
the
boss
goes
among
them
smiling
and
they
smile
back
the
elder
brother
and
the
younger
brothers
that
what
they
must
be
loving
brothers
and
then
strikes
would
be
as
inconceivable
as
hatred
in
the
home
it
was
at
this
point
that
babbitt
muttered
oh
rot
huh
said
chum
frink
he
does
know
what
he
talking
about
it
just
as
clear
as
mud
it
does
mean
a
darn
maybe
but
frink
looked
at
him
doubtfully
through
all
the
service
kept
glancing
at
him
doubtfully
till
babbitt
was
nervous
ii
the
strikers
had
announced
a
parade
for
tuesday
morning
but
colonel
nixon
had
forbidden
it
the
newspapers
said
when
babbitt
drove
west
from
his
office
at
ten
that
morning
he
saw
a
drove
of
shabby
men
heading
toward
the
tangled
dirty
district
beyond
court
house
square
he
hated
them
because
they
were
poor
because
they
made
him
feel
insecure
damn
loafers
would
be
common
workmen
if
they
had
any
pep
he
complained
he
wondered
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
riot
he
drove
toward
the
of
the
parade
a
triangle
of
limp
and
faded
grass
known
as
moore
street
park
and
halted
his
car
the
park
and
streets
were
buzzing
with
strikers
young
men
in
blue
denim
shirts
old
men
with
caps
through
them
keeping
them
stirred
like
a
boiling
pot
moved
the
militiamen
babbitt
could
hear
the
monotonous
orders
keep
moving
move
on
keep
your
feet
warm
babbitt
admired
their
stolid
good
temper
the
crowd
shouted
tin
soldiers
and
dirty
dogs
servants
of
the
capitalists
but
the
militiamen
grinned
and
answered
only
sure
that
right
keep
moving
billy
babbitt
thrilled
over
the
hated
the
scoundrels
who
were
obstructing
the
pleasant
ways
of
prosperity
admired
colonel
nixon
striding
contempt
for
the
crowd
and
as
captain
clarence
drum
that
rather
puffing
came
raging
by
babbitt
respectfully
clamored
great
work
captain
do
let
march
he
watched
the
strikers
filing
from
the
park
many
of
them
bore
posters
with
they
ca
stop
our
peacefully
the
militiamen
tore
away
the
posters
but
the
strikers
fell
in
behind
their
leaders
and
straggled
off
a
thin
unimpressive
trickle
between
lines
of
soldiers
babbitt
saw
with
disappointment
that
there
was
going
to
be
any
violence
nothing
interesting
at
all
then
he
gasped
among
the
marchers
beside
a
bulky
young
workman
was
seneca
doane
smiling
content
in
front
of
him
was
professor
brockbank
head
of
the
history
department
in
the
state
university
an
old
man
and
known
to
come
from
a
distinguished
massachusetts
family
why
gosh
babbitt
marveled
a
swell
like
him
in
with
the
strikers
and
good
ole
senny
doane
they
fools
to
get
mixed
up
with
this
bunch
they
parlor
socialists
but
they
have
got
nerve
and
nothing
in
it
for
them
not
a
cent
and
i
do
know
all
the
strikers
look
like
such
tough
nuts
look
just
about
like
anybody
else
to
me
the
militiamen
were
turning
the
parade
down
a
side
street
they
got
just
as
much
right
to
march
as
anybody
else
they
own
the
streets
as
much
as
clarence
drum
or
the
american
legion
does
babbitt
grumbled
of
course
they
they
a
bad
element
but
oh
rats
at
the
athletic
club
babbitt
was
silent
during
lunch
while
the
others
fretted
i
do
know
what
the
world
coming
to
or
solaced
their
spirits
with
captain
clarence
drum
came
swinging
by
splendid
in
khaki
how
it
going
captain
inquired
vergil
gunch
oh
we
got
stopped
we
worked
off
on
side
streets
and
separated
and
they
got
discouraged
and
went
fine
work
no
fine
work
nothing
groaned
mr
drum
if
i
had
my
way
there
be
a
whole
lot
of
violence
and
i
start
it
and
then
the
whole
thing
would
be
over
i
do
believe
in
standing
back
and
these
fellows
and
letting
the
disturbances
drag
on
i
tell
you
these
strikers
are
nothing
in
god
world
but
a
lot
of
socialists
and
thugs
and
the
only
way
to
handle
is
with
a
club
that
what
i
do
beat
up
the
whole
lot
of
babbitt
heard
himself
saying
oh
rats
clarence
they
look
just
about
like
you
and
me
and
i
certainly
did
notice
any
drum
complained
oh
you
did
eh
well
maybe
you
like
to
take
charge
of
the
strike
just
tell
colonel
nixon
what
innocents
the
strikers
are
he
be
glad
to
hear
about
it
drum
strode
on
while
all
the
table
stared
at
babbitt
what
the
idea
do
you
want
us
to
give
those
love
and
kisses
or
what
said
orville
jones
do
you
defend
a
lot
of
hoodlums
that
are
trying
to
take
the
bread
and
butter
away
from
our
families
raged
professor
pumphrey
vergil
gunch
intimidatingly
said
nothing
he
put
on
sternness
like
a
mask
his
jaw
was
hard
his
bristly
short
hair
seemed
cruel
his
silence
was
a
ferocious
thunder
while
the
others
assured
babbitt
that
they
must
have
misunderstood
him
gunch
looked
as
though
he
had
understood
only
too
well
like
a
robed
judge
he
listened
to
babbitt
stammering
no
sure
course
they
a
bunch
of
toughs
but
i
just
mean
strikes
me
it
bad
policy
to
talk
about
clubbing
cabe
nixon
does
got
the
fine
italian
hand
and
that
why
he
colonel
clarence
drum
is
jealous
of
well
said
professor
pumphrey
you
hurt
clarence
feelings
george
he
been
out
there
all
morning
getting
hot
and
dusty
and
no
wonder
he
wants
to
beat
the
tar
out
of
those
sons
of
guns
gunch
said
nothing
and
watched
and
babbitt
knew
that
he
was
being
watched
iii
as
he
was
leaving
the
club
babbitt
heard
chum
frink
protesting
to
gunch
do
know
what
got
into
him
last
sunday
doc
drew
preached
a
corking
sermon
about
decency
in
business
and
babbitt
kicked
about
that
too
near
i
can
figure
out
babbitt
was
vaguely
frightened
iv
he
saw
a
crowd
listening
to
a
man
who
was
talking
from
the
rostrum
of
a
he
stopped
his
car
from
newspaper
pictures
he
knew
that
the
speaker
must
be
the
notorious
freelance
preacher
beecher
ingram
of
whom
seneca
doane
had
spoken
ingram
was
a
gaunt
man
with
flamboyant
hair
cheeks
and
worried
eyes
he
was
pleading
if
those
telephone
girls
can
hold
out
living
on
one
meal
a
day
doing
their
own
washing
starving
and
smiling
you
big
hulking
men
ought
to
be
able
babbitt
saw
that
from
the
sidewalk
vergil
gunch
was
watching
him
in
vague
disquiet
he
started
the
car
and
mechanically
drove
on
while
gunch
hostile
eyes
seemed
to
follow
him
all
the
way
v
there
a
lot
of
these
fellows
babbitt
was
complaining
to
his
wife
that
think
if
workmen
go
on
strike
they
a
regular
bunch
of
fiends
now
of
course
it
a
fight
between
sound
business
and
the
destructive
element
and
we
got
to
lick
the
stuffin
out
of
when
they
challenge
us
but
doggoned
if
i
see
why
we
ca
fight
like
gentlemen
and
not
go
calling
dirty
dogs
and
saying
they
ought
to
be
shot
why
george
she
said
placidly
i
thought
you
always
insisted
that
all
strikers
ought
to
be
put
in
i
never
did
well
i
mean
some
of
of
course
irresponsible
leaders
but
i
mean
a
fellow
ought
to
be
and
liberal
about
things
like
but
dearie
i
thought
you
always
said
these
people
were
the
worst
of
rats
woman
never
can
understand
the
different
definitions
of
a
word
depends
on
how
you
mean
it
and
it
do
pay
to
be
too
cocksure
about
anything
now
these
strikers
honest
they
not
such
bad
people
just
foolish
they
do
understand
the
complications
of
merchandizing
and
profit
the
way
we
business
men
do
but
sometimes
i
think
about
like
the
rest
of
us
and
no
more
hogs
for
wages
than
we
are
for
george
if
people
were
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
of
course
i
know
you
i
remember
what
a
wild
crazy
boy
you
were
i
know
you
do
mean
a
word
you
say
but
if
people
that
did
understand
you
were
to
hear
you
talking
they
think
you
were
a
regular
socialist
what
do
i
care
what
anybody
thinks
and
let
me
tell
you
right
now
i
want
you
to
distinctly
understand
i
never
was
a
wild
crazy
kid
and
when
i
say
a
thing
i
mean
it
and
i
stand
by
it
and
honest
do
you
think
people
would
think
i
was
too
liberal
if
i
just
said
the
strikers
were
decent
of
course
they
would
but
do
worry
dear
i
know
you
do
mean
a
word
of
it
time
to
trot
up
to
bed
now
have
you
enough
covers
for
on
the
he
puzzled
she
does
understand
me
hardly
understand
myself
why
ca
i
take
things
easy
way
i
used
to
wish
i
could
go
out
to
senny
doane
house
and
talk
things
over
with
him
no
suppose
verg
gunch
saw
me
going
in
there
wish
i
knew
some
really
smart
woman
and
nice
that
would
see
what
trying
to
get
at
and
let
me
talk
to
her
and
i
wonder
if
myra
right
could
the
fellows
think
i
gone
nutty
just
because
i
and
liberal
way
verg
looked
at
me
chapter
xxviii
i
miss
mcgoun
came
into
his
private
office
at
three
in
the
afternoon
with
lissen
babbitt
there
a
judique
on
the
wants
to
see
about
some
repairs
and
the
salesmen
are
all
out
want
to
talk
to
her
all
the
voice
of
tanis
judique
was
clear
and
pleasant
the
black
cylinder
of
the
seemed
to
hold
a
tiny
animated
image
of
her
lustrous
eyes
delicate
nose
gentle
chin
this
is
judique
do
you
remember
me
you
drove
me
up
here
to
the
cavendish
apartments
and
helped
me
find
such
a
nice
sure
bet
i
remember
what
can
i
do
for
you
why
it
just
a
little
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
bother
you
but
the
janitor
does
seem
to
be
able
to
fix
it
you
know
my
flat
is
on
the
top
floor
and
with
these
autumn
rains
the
roof
is
beginning
to
leak
and
i
be
awfully
glad
if
sure
i
come
up
and
take
a
look
at
nervously
when
do
you
expect
to
be
in
why
i
in
every
be
in
this
afternoon
in
an
hour
or
so
perhaps
i
could
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
i
think
i
ought
to
after
all
your
fine
i
run
up
there
soon
as
i
can
get
he
meditated
now
there
a
woman
that
got
refinement
savvy
class
all
your
trouble
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
she
appreciate
a
fellow
i
a
fool
but
i
not
such
a
bad
cuss
get
to
know
me
and
not
so
much
a
fool
as
they
think
the
great
strike
was
over
the
strikers
beaten
except
that
vergil
gunch
seemed
less
cordial
there
were
no
visible
effects
of
treachery
to
the
clan
the
oppressive
fear
of
criticism
was
gone
but
a
diffident
loneliness
remained
now
he
was
so
exhilarated
that
to
prove
he
was
he
droned
about
the
office
for
fifteen
minutes
looking
at
explaining
to
miss
mcgoun
that
this
scott
wanted
more
money
for
her
house
had
raised
the
raised
it
from
seven
thousand
to
hundred
would
miss
mcgoun
be
sure
and
put
it
down
on
the
card
scott
house
raise
when
he
had
thus
established
himself
as
a
person
unemotional
and
interested
only
in
business
he
sauntered
out
he
took
a
particularly
long
time
to
start
his
car
he
kicked
the
tires
dusted
the
glass
of
the
speedometer
and
tightened
the
screws
holding
the
he
drove
happily
off
toward
the
bellevue
district
conscious
of
the
presence
of
judique
as
of
a
brilliant
light
on
the
horizon
the
maple
leaves
had
fallen
and
they
lined
the
gutters
of
the
asphalted
streets
it
was
a
day
of
pale
gold
and
faded
green
tranquil
and
lingering
babbitt
was
aware
of
the
meditative
day
and
of
the
barrenness
of
bellevue
blocks
of
wooden
houses
garages
little
shops
weedy
lots
needs
pepping
up
needs
the
touch
that
people
like
judique
could
give
a
place
he
ruminated
as
he
rattled
through
the
long
crude
airy
streets
the
wind
rose
enlivening
keen
and
in
a
blaze
of
he
came
to
the
flat
of
tanis
judique
she
was
wearing
when
she
flutteringly
admitted
him
a
frock
of
black
chiffon
cut
modestly
round
at
the
base
of
her
pretty
throat
she
seemed
to
him
immensely
sophisticated
he
glanced
at
the
cretonnes
and
colored
prints
in
her
and
gurgled
gosh
you
fixed
the
place
nice
takes
a
clever
woman
to
know
how
to
make
a
home
all
right
you
really
like
it
i
so
glad
but
you
neglected
me
scandalously
you
promised
to
come
some
time
and
learn
to
rather
unsteadily
oh
but
you
did
mean
it
seriously
perhaps
not
but
you
might
have
tried
well
here
i
come
for
my
lesson
and
you
might
just
as
well
prepare
to
have
me
stay
for
supper
they
both
laughed
in
a
manner
which
indicated
that
of
course
he
mean
it
but
first
i
guess
i
better
look
at
that
she
climbed
with
him
to
the
flat
roof
of
the
a
detached
world
of
slatted
wooden
walks
clotheslines
in
a
penthouse
he
poked
at
things
with
his
toe
and
sought
to
impress
her
by
being
learned
about
copper
gutters
the
desirability
of
passing
plumbing
pipes
through
a
lead
collar
and
sleeve
and
flashing
them
with
copper
and
the
advantages
of
cedar
over
for
you
have
to
know
so
much
in
real
estate
she
admired
he
promised
that
the
roof
should
be
repaired
within
two
days
do
you
mind
my
from
your
apartment
he
asked
heavens
no
he
stood
a
moment
at
the
coping
looking
over
a
land
of
hard
little
bungalows
with
abnormally
large
porches
and
new
small
but
brave
with
variegated
brick
walls
and
trimmings
beyond
them
was
a
hill
with
a
gouge
of
yellow
clay
like
a
vast
wound
behind
every
beside
each
dwelling
were
small
garages
it
was
a
world
of
good
little
people
comfortable
industrious
credulous
in
the
autumnal
light
the
flat
newness
was
mellowed
and
the
air
was
a
pool
golly
it
one
fine
afternoon
you
get
a
great
view
here
right
up
tanner
hill
said
babbitt
yes
is
it
nice
and
so
darn
few
people
appreciate
a
do
you
go
raising
my
rent
on
that
account
oh
that
was
naughty
of
me
i
was
just
teasing
seriously
though
there
are
so
few
who
respond
who
react
to
views
i
mean
they
have
any
feeling
of
poetry
and
that
a
fact
they
have
he
breathed
admiring
her
slenderness
and
the
absorbed
airy
way
in
which
she
looked
toward
the
hill
chin
lifted
lips
smiling
well
guess
i
better
telephone
the
plumbers
so
get
on
the
job
first
thing
in
the
when
he
had
telephoned
making
it
conspicuously
authoritative
and
gruff
and
masculine
he
looked
doubtful
and
sighed
i
better
be
oh
you
must
have
that
cup
of
tea
first
well
it
would
go
pretty
good
at
it
was
luxurious
to
loll
in
a
deep
green
rep
chair
his
legs
thrust
out
before
him
to
glance
at
the
black
chinese
telephone
stand
and
the
colored
photograph
of
mount
vernon
which
he
had
always
liked
so
much
while
in
the
tiny
kitchen
so
near
judique
sang
my
creole
in
an
intolerable
sweetness
a
contentment
so
deep
that
he
was
wistfully
discontented
he
saw
magnolias
by
moonlight
and
heard
plantation
darkies
crooning
to
the
banjo
he
wanted
to
be
near
her
on
pretense
of
helping
her
yet
he
wanted
to
remain
in
this
still
ecstasy
languidly
he
remained
when
she
bustled
in
with
the
tea
he
smiled
up
at
her
this
is
awfully
nice
for
the
first
time
he
was
not
fencing
he
was
quietly
and
securely
friendly
and
friendly
and
quiet
was
her
answer
it
nice
to
have
you
here
you
were
so
kind
helping
me
to
find
this
little
they
agreed
that
the
weather
would
soon
turn
cold
they
agreed
that
prohibition
was
prohibitive
they
agreed
that
art
in
the
home
was
cultural
they
agreed
about
everything
they
even
became
bold
they
hinted
that
these
modern
young
girls
well
honestly
their
short
skirts
were
short
they
were
proud
to
find
that
they
were
not
shocked
by
such
frank
speaking
tanis
ventured
i
know
you
understand
i
mean
i
do
quite
know
how
to
say
it
but
i
do
think
that
girls
who
pretend
they
bad
by
the
way
they
dress
really
never
go
any
farther
they
give
away
the
fact
that
they
have
the
instincts
of
a
womanly
remembering
ida
putiak
the
manicure
girl
and
how
ill
she
had
used
him
babbitt
agreed
with
enthusiasm
remembering
how
ill
all
the
world
had
used
him
he
told
of
paul
riesling
of
zilla
of
seneca
doane
of
the
strike
see
how
it
was
course
i
was
as
anxious
to
have
those
beggars
licked
to
a
standstill
as
anybody
else
but
gosh
no
reason
for
not
seeing
their
side
for
a
fellow
own
sake
he
got
to
be
and
liberal
do
you
think
so
oh
i
do
sitting
on
the
hard
little
couch
she
clasped
her
hands
beside
her
leaned
toward
him
absorbed
him
and
in
a
glorious
state
of
being
appreciated
he
proclaimed
so
i
up
and
said
to
the
fellows
at
the
club
here
i
do
you
belong
to
the
union
club
i
think
it
no
the
athletic
tell
you
course
they
always
asking
me
to
join
the
union
but
i
always
say
sir
nothing
doing
i
do
mind
the
expense
but
i
ca
stand
all
the
old
oh
yes
that
so
but
tell
me
what
did
you
say
to
them
oh
you
do
want
to
hear
it
i
probably
boring
you
to
death
with
my
troubles
you
would
hardly
think
i
was
an
old
duffer
i
sound
like
a
kid
oh
you
a
boy
yet
i
mean
you
ca
be
a
day
over
well
i
not
much
but
by
golly
i
begin
to
feel
sometimes
all
these
responsibilities
and
oh
i
know
her
voice
caressed
him
it
cloaked
him
like
warm
silk
and
i
feel
lonely
so
lonely
some
days
we
a
sad
pair
of
birds
but
i
think
we
pretty
darn
nice
yes
i
think
we
lots
nicer
than
most
people
i
know
they
smiled
but
please
tell
me
what
you
said
at
the
well
it
was
like
this
course
seneca
doane
is
a
friend
of
mine
they
can
say
what
they
want
to
they
can
call
him
anything
they
please
but
what
most
folks
here
do
know
is
that
senny
is
the
bosom
pal
of
some
of
the
biggest
statesmen
in
the
world
lord
wycombe
frinstance
you
know
this
big
british
nobleman
my
friend
sir
gerald
doak
told
me
that
lord
wycombe
is
one
of
the
biggest
guns
in
england
well
doak
or
somebody
told
oh
do
you
know
sir
gerald
the
one
that
was
here
at
the
mckelveys
know
him
well
say
i
know
him
just
well
enough
so
we
call
each
other
george
and
jerry
and
we
got
so
pickled
together
in
chicago
that
must
have
been
fun
but
she
shook
a
finger
at
him
i
have
you
getting
pickled
i
have
to
take
you
in
hand
wish
you
would
well
zize
saying
you
see
i
happen
to
know
what
a
big
noise
senny
doane
is
outside
of
zenith
but
of
course
a
prophet
has
got
any
honor
in
his
own
country
and
senny
darn
his
old
hide
he
so
blame
modest
that
he
never
lets
folks
know
the
kind
of
an
outfit
he
travels
with
when
he
goes
abroad
well
during
the
strike
clarence
drum
comes
up
to
our
table
all
dolled
up
fit
to
kill
in
his
nice
lil
uniform
and
somebody
says
to
him
the
strike
clarence
well
he
swells
up
like
a
and
he
hollers
so
you
could
hear
him
way
up
in
the
sure
i
told
the
where
they
got
off
and
so
they
went
home
i
says
to
him
there
was
any
violence
he
says
if
i
had
kept
my
eye
skinned
there
would
been
all
those
fellows
had
bombs
in
their
pockets
they
anarchists
rats
clarence
i
says
looked
all
over
carefully
and
they
did
have
any
more
bombs
a
rabbit
i
says
i
says
foolish
but
they
a
good
deal
like
you
and
me
after
all
and
then
vergil
gunch
or
somebody
no
it
was
chum
frink
you
know
this
famous
poet
great
pal
of
mine
he
says
to
me
here
he
says
you
mean
to
say
you
advocate
these
strikes
well
i
was
so
disgusted
with
a
fellow
whose
mind
worked
that
way
that
i
swear
i
had
a
good
mind
to
not
explain
at
all
just
ignore
him
oh
that
so
wise
said
judique
but
finally
i
explains
to
him
you
done
as
much
as
i
have
on
chamber
of
commerce
committees
and
all
i
says
you
have
the
right
to
talk
but
same
time
i
says
believe
in
treating
your
opponent
like
a
gentleman
well
sir
that
held
frink
chum
i
always
call
him
he
did
have
another
word
to
say
but
at
that
i
guess
some
of
kind
o
thought
i
was
too
liberal
what
do
you
think
oh
you
were
so
wise
and
courageous
i
love
a
man
to
have
the
courage
of
his
convictions
but
do
you
think
it
was
a
good
stunt
after
all
some
of
these
fellows
are
so
darn
cautious
and
that
they
prejudiced
against
a
fellow
that
talks
right
out
in
what
do
you
care
in
the
long
run
they
bound
to
respect
a
man
who
makes
them
think
and
with
your
reputation
for
oratory
you
what
do
you
know
about
my
reputation
for
oratory
oh
i
not
going
to
tell
you
everything
i
know
but
seriously
you
do
realize
what
a
famous
man
you
well
though
i
have
done
much
orating
this
fall
too
kind
of
bothered
by
this
paul
riesling
business
i
guess
but
do
you
know
you
the
first
person
that
really
understood
what
i
was
getting
at
tanis
listen
to
me
will
you
fat
nerve
i
got
calling
you
tanis
oh
do
and
shall
i
call
you
george
do
you
think
it
awfully
nice
when
two
people
have
so
much
what
shall
i
call
it
so
much
analysis
that
they
can
discard
all
these
stupid
conventions
and
understand
each
other
and
become
acquainted
right
away
like
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
i
certainly
do
i
certainly
do
he
was
no
longer
quiescent
in
his
chair
he
wandered
about
the
room
he
dropped
on
the
couch
beside
her
but
as
he
awkwardly
stretched
his
hand
toward
her
fragile
immaculate
fingers
she
said
brightly
do
give
me
a
cigarette
would
you
think
poor
tanis
was
dreadfully
naughty
if
she
smoked
lord
no
i
like
it
he
had
often
and
weightily
pondered
flappers
smoking
in
zenith
restaurants
but
he
knew
only
one
woman
who
smoked
sam
doppelbrau
his
flighty
neighbor
he
ceremoniously
lighted
tanis
cigarette
looked
for
a
place
to
deposit
the
burnt
match
and
dropped
it
into
his
pocket
i
sure
you
want
a
cigar
you
poor
man
she
crooned
do
you
mind
one
oh
no
i
love
the
smell
of
a
good
cigar
so
nice
and
so
nice
and
like
a
man
you
find
an
in
my
bedroom
on
the
table
beside
the
bed
if
you
do
mind
getting
he
was
embarrassed
by
her
bedroom
the
broad
couch
with
a
cover
of
violet
silk
mauve
curtains
striped
with
gold
chinese
chippendale
bureau
and
an
amazing
row
of
slippers
with
and
primrose
stockings
lying
across
them
his
manner
of
bringing
the
had
just
the
right
note
of
easy
friendliness
he
felt
a
boob
like
verg
gunch
would
try
to
get
funny
about
seeing
her
bedroom
but
i
take
it
he
was
not
casual
afterward
the
contentment
of
companionship
was
gone
and
he
was
restless
with
desire
to
touch
her
hand
but
whenever
he
turned
toward
her
the
cigarette
was
in
his
way
it
was
a
shield
between
them
he
waited
till
she
should
have
finished
but
as
he
rejoiced
at
her
quick
crushing
of
its
light
on
the
ashtray
she
said
do
you
want
to
give
me
another
cigarette
and
hopelessly
he
saw
the
screen
of
pale
smoke
and
her
graceful
tilted
hand
again
between
them
he
was
not
merely
curious
now
to
find
out
whether
she
would
let
him
hold
her
hand
all
in
the
purest
friendship
naturally
but
agonized
with
need
of
it
on
the
surface
appeared
none
of
all
this
fretful
drama
they
were
talking
cheerfully
of
motors
of
trips
to
california
of
chum
frink
once
he
said
delicately
i
do
hate
these
guys
i
hate
these
people
that
invite
themselves
to
meals
but
i
seem
to
have
a
feeling
i
going
to
have
supper
with
the
lovely
tanis
judique
but
i
suppose
you
probably
have
seven
dates
well
i
was
thinking
some
of
going
to
the
movies
yes
i
really
think
i
ought
to
get
out
and
get
some
fresh
she
did
not
encourage
him
to
stay
but
never
did
she
discourage
him
he
considered
i
better
take
a
sneak
she
will
let
me
stay
there
is
something
doing
and
i
must
get
mixed
up
with
i
must
i
got
to
beat
then
no
it
too
late
suddenly
at
seven
brushing
her
cigarette
away
brusquely
taking
her
hand
tanis
stop
teasing
me
you
know
we
here
we
are
a
couple
of
lonely
birds
and
we
awful
happy
together
anyway
i
am
never
been
so
happy
do
let
me
stay
i
gallop
down
to
the
delicatessen
and
buy
some
stuff
cold
chicken
maybe
or
cold
turkey
and
we
can
have
a
nice
little
supper
and
afterwards
if
you
want
to
chase
me
out
i
be
good
and
go
like
a
well
yes
it
would
be
nice
she
said
nor
did
she
withdraw
her
hand
he
squeezed
it
trembling
and
blundered
toward
his
coat
at
the
delicatessen
he
bought
preposterous
stores
of
food
chosen
on
the
principle
of
expensiveness
from
the
drug
store
across
the
street
he
telephoned
to
his
wife
got
to
get
a
fellow
to
sign
a
lease
before
he
leaves
town
on
the
midnight
wo
be
home
till
late
do
wait
up
for
me
kiss
tinka
he
expectantly
lumbered
back
to
the
flat
oh
you
bad
thing
to
buy
so
much
food
was
her
greeting
and
her
voice
was
gay
her
smile
acceptant
he
helped
her
in
the
tiny
white
kitchen
he
washed
the
lettuce
he
opened
the
olive
bottle
she
ordered
him
to
set
the
table
and
as
he
trotted
into
the
as
he
hunted
through
the
buffet
for
knives
and
forks
he
felt
utterly
at
home
now
the
only
other
thing
he
announced
is
what
you
going
to
wear
i
ca
decide
whether
you
to
put
on
your
swellest
evening
gown
or
let
your
hair
down
and
put
on
short
skirts
and
you
a
little
i
going
to
dine
just
as
i
am
in
this
old
chiffon
rag
and
if
you
ca
stand
poor
tanis
that
way
you
can
go
to
the
club
for
dinner
stand
you
he
patted
her
shoulder
child
you
the
brainiest
and
the
loveliest
and
finest
woman
i
ever
met
come
now
lady
wycombe
if
you
take
the
duke
of
zenith
arm
we
will
proambulate
in
to
the
magnolious
feed
oh
you
do
say
the
funniest
nicest
things
when
they
had
finished
the
picnic
supper
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
reported
it
turned
awful
chilly
and
i
think
it
going
to
rain
you
do
want
to
go
to
the
well
i
wish
we
had
a
fireplace
i
wish
it
was
raining
like
all
and
we
were
in
a
funny
little
cottage
and
the
trees
thrashing
like
everything
outside
and
a
great
big
log
fire
and
i
tell
you
let
draw
this
couch
up
to
the
radiator
and
stretch
our
feet
out
and
pretend
it
a
oh
i
think
that
pathetic
you
big
child
but
they
did
draw
up
to
the
radiator
and
propped
their
feet
against
it
his
clumsy
black
shoes
her
slippers
in
the
dimness
they
talked
of
themselves
of
how
lonely
she
was
how
bewildered
he
and
how
wonderful
that
they
had
found
each
other
as
they
fell
silent
the
room
was
stiller
than
a
country
lane
there
was
no
sound
from
the
street
save
the
whir
of
the
rumble
of
a
distant
was
the
room
warm
secure
insulated
from
the
harassing
world
he
was
absorbed
by
a
rapture
in
which
all
fear
and
doubting
were
smoothed
away
and
when
he
reached
home
at
dawn
the
rapture
had
mellowed
to
contentment
serene
and
full
of
memories
chapter
xxix
i
the
assurance
of
tanis
judique
friendship
fortified
at
the
athletic
club
he
became
experimental
though
vergil
gunch
was
silent
the
others
at
the
roughnecks
table
came
to
accept
babbitt
as
having
for
no
visible
reason
turned
they
argued
windily
with
him
and
he
was
cocky
and
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
his
interesting
martyrdom
he
even
praised
seneca
doane
professor
pumphrey
said
that
was
carrying
a
joke
too
far
but
babbitt
argued
no
fact
i
tell
you
he
got
one
of
the
keenest
intellects
in
the
country
why
lord
wycombe
said
that
oh
who
the
hell
is
lord
wycombe
what
you
always
lugging
him
in
for
you
been
touting
him
for
the
last
six
weeks
protested
orville
jones
george
ordered
him
from
you
can
get
those
english
by
mail
for
two
bucks
apiece
suggested
sidney
finkelstein
that
all
right
now
lord
wycombe
he
one
of
the
biggest
intellects
in
english
political
life
as
i
was
saying
of
course
i
conservative
myself
but
i
appreciate
a
guy
like
senny
doane
because
vergil
gunch
interrupted
harshly
i
wonder
if
you
are
so
conservative
i
find
i
can
manage
to
run
my
own
business
without
any
skunks
and
reds
like
doane
in
it
the
grimness
of
gunch
voice
the
hardness
of
his
jaw
disconcerted
babbitt
but
he
recovered
and
went
on
till
they
looked
bored
then
irritated
then
as
doubtful
as
gunch
ii
he
thought
of
tanis
always
with
a
stir
he
remembered
her
every
aspect
his
arms
yearned
for
her
i
found
her
i
dreamed
of
her
all
these
years
and
now
i
found
her
he
exulted
he
met
her
at
the
movies
in
the
morning
he
drove
out
to
her
flat
in
the
late
afternoon
or
on
evenings
when
he
was
believed
to
be
at
the
elks
he
knew
her
financial
affairs
and
advised
her
about
them
while
she
lamented
her
feminine
ignorance
and
praised
his
masterfulness
and
proved
to
know
much
more
about
bonds
than
he
did
they
had
remembrances
and
laughter
over
old
times
once
they
quarreled
and
he
raged
that
she
was
as
bossy
as
his
wife
and
far
more
whining
when
he
was
inattentive
but
that
passed
safely
their
high
hour
was
a
tramp
on
a
ringing
december
afternoon
through
meadows
down
to
the
icy
chaloosa
river
she
was
exotic
in
an
astrachan
cap
and
a
short
beaver
coat
she
slid
on
the
ice
and
shouted
and
he
panted
after
her
rotund
with
laughter
myra
babbitt
never
slid
on
the
ice
he
was
afraid
that
they
would
be
seen
together
in
zenith
it
is
impossible
to
lunch
with
a
neighbor
wife
without
the
fact
being
known
before
nightfall
in
every
house
in
your
circle
but
tanis
was
beautifully
discreet
however
appealingly
she
might
turn
to
him
when
they
were
alone
she
was
gravely
detached
when
they
were
abroad
and
he
hoped
that
she
would
be
taken
for
a
client
orville
jones
once
saw
them
emerging
from
a
movie
theater
and
babbitt
bumbled
let
me
make
you
with
judique
now
here
a
lady
who
knows
the
right
broker
to
come
to
orvy
jones
though
he
was
a
man
censorious
of
morals
and
of
laundry
machinery
seemed
satisfied
his
predominant
fear
not
from
any
especial
fondness
for
her
but
from
the
habit
of
propriety
was
that
his
wife
would
learn
of
the
affair
he
was
certain
that
she
knew
nothing
specific
about
tanis
but
he
was
also
certain
that
she
suspected
something
indefinite
for
years
she
had
been
bored
by
anything
more
affectionate
than
a
farewell
kiss
yet
she
was
hurt
by
any
slackening
in
his
irritable
periodic
interest
and
now
he
had
no
interest
rather
a
revulsion
he
was
completely
faithful
to
tanis
he
was
distressed
by
the
sight
of
his
wife
slack
plumpness
by
her
puffs
and
billows
of
flesh
by
the
tattered
petticoat
which
she
was
always
meaning
and
always
forgetting
to
throw
away
but
he
was
aware
that
she
so
long
attuned
to
him
caught
all
his
repulsions
he
elaborately
heavily
jocularly
tried
to
check
them
he
could
they
had
a
tolerable
christmas
kenneth
escott
was
there
admittedly
engaged
to
verona
babbitt
was
tearful
and
called
kenneth
her
new
son
babbitt
was
worried
about
ted
because
he
had
ceased
complaining
of
the
state
university
and
become
suspiciously
acquiescent
he
wondered
what
the
boy
was
planning
and
was
too
shy
to
ask
himself
babbitt
slipped
away
on
christmas
afternoon
to
take
his
present
a
silver
to
tanis
when
he
returned
babbitt
asked
much
too
innocently
did
you
go
out
for
a
little
fresh
air
yes
just
lil
drive
he
mumbled
after
new
year
his
wife
proposed
i
heard
from
my
sister
george
she
is
well
i
think
perhaps
i
ought
to
go
stay
with
her
for
a
few
now
babbitt
was
not
accustomed
to
leave
home
during
the
winter
except
on
violently
demanding
occasions
and
only
the
summer
before
she
had
been
gone
for
weeks
nor
was
babbitt
one
of
the
detachable
husbands
who
take
separations
casually
he
liked
to
have
her
there
she
looked
after
his
clothes
she
knew
how
his
steak
ought
to
be
cooked
and
her
clucking
made
him
feel
secure
but
he
could
not
drum
up
even
a
dutiful
oh
she
does
really
need
you
does
she
while
he
tried
to
look
regretful
while
he
felt
that
his
wife
was
watching
him
he
was
filled
with
exultant
visions
of
tanis
do
you
think
i
better
go
she
said
sharply
you
got
to
decide
honey
i
she
turned
away
sighing
and
his
forehead
was
damp
till
she
went
four
days
later
she
was
curiously
still
he
cumbrously
affectionate
her
train
left
at
noon
as
he
saw
it
grow
small
beyond
the
he
longed
to
hurry
to
tanis
no
by
golly
i
wo
do
that
he
vowed
i
wo
go
near
her
for
a
week
but
he
was
at
her
flat
at
four
iii
he
who
had
once
controlled
or
seemed
to
control
his
life
in
a
progress
unimpassioned
but
diligent
and
sane
was
for
that
fortnight
borne
on
a
current
of
desire
and
very
bad
whisky
and
all
the
complications
of
new
acquaintances
those
furious
new
intimates
who
demand
so
much
more
attention
than
old
friends
each
morning
he
gloomily
recognized
his
idiocies
of
the
evening
before
with
his
head
throbbing
his
tongue
and
lips
stinging
from
cigarettes
he
incredulously
counted
the
number
of
drinks
he
had
taken
and
groaned
i
got
to
quit
he
had
ceased
saying
i
will
quit
for
however
resolute
he
might
be
at
dawn
he
could
not
for
a
single
evening
check
his
drift
he
had
met
tanis
friends
he
had
with
the
ardent
haste
of
the
midnight
people
who
drink
and
dance
and
rattle
and
are
ever
afraid
to
be
silent
been
adopted
as
a
member
of
her
group
which
they
called
the
he
first
met
them
after
a
day
when
he
had
worked
particularly
hard
and
when
he
hoped
to
be
quiet
with
tanis
and
slowly
sip
her
admiration
from
down
the
hall
he
could
hear
shrieks
and
the
grind
of
a
phonograph
as
tanis
opened
the
door
he
saw
fantastic
figures
dancing
in
a
haze
of
cigarette
smoke
the
tables
and
chairs
were
against
the
wall
oh
is
this
dandy
she
gabbled
at
him
carrie
nork
had
the
loveliest
idea
she
decided
it
was
time
for
a
party
and
she
the
bunch
and
told
to
gather
round
george
this
is
carrie
was
in
the
less
desirable
aspects
of
both
at
once
matronly
and
spinsterish
she
was
perhaps
forty
her
hair
was
an
unconvincing
and
if
her
chest
was
flat
her
hips
were
ponderous
she
greeted
babbitt
with
a
giggling
welcome
to
our
little
midst
tanis
says
you
a
real
he
was
apparently
expected
to
dance
to
be
boyish
and
gay
with
carrie
and
he
did
his
unforgiving
best
he
towed
her
about
the
room
bumping
into
other
couples
into
the
radiator
into
cunningly
ambushed
as
he
danced
he
surveyed
the
rest
of
the
bunch
a
thin
young
woman
who
looked
capable
conceited
and
sarcastic
another
woman
whom
he
could
never
quite
remember
three
overdressed
and
slightly
effeminate
young
men
clerks
or
at
least
born
for
that
profession
a
man
of
his
own
age
immovable
resentful
of
presence
when
he
had
finished
his
dutiful
dance
tanis
took
him
aside
and
begged
dear
would
you
like
to
do
something
for
me
i
all
out
of
booze
and
the
bunch
want
to
celebrate
could
you
just
skip
down
to
healey
hanson
and
get
some
sure
he
said
trying
not
to
sound
sullen
i
tell
you
i
get
minnie
sonntag
to
drive
down
with
tanis
was
pointing
to
the
thin
sarcastic
young
woman
miss
sonntag
greeted
him
with
an
astringent
how
do
babbitt
tanis
tells
me
you
a
very
prominent
man
and
i
honored
by
being
allowed
to
drive
with
you
of
course
i
not
accustomed
to
associating
with
society
people
like
you
so
i
do
know
how
to
act
in
such
exalted
circles
thus
miss
sonntag
talked
all
the
way
down
to
healey
hanson
to
her
jibes
he
wanted
to
reply
oh
go
to
the
devil
but
he
never
quite
nerved
himself
to
that
reasonable
comment
he
was
resenting
the
existence
of
the
whole
bunch
he
had
heard
tanis
speak
of
darling
carrie
and
min
sonntag
she
so
clever
you
adore
her
but
they
had
never
been
real
to
him
he
had
pictured
tanis
as
living
in
a
vacuum
waiting
for
him
free
of
all
the
complications
of
a
floral
heights
when
they
returned
he
had
to
endure
the
patronage
of
the
young
they
were
as
damply
friendly
as
miss
sonntag
was
dryly
hostile
they
called
him
old
georgie
and
shouted
come
on
now
sport
shake
a
leg
boys
in
belted
coats
pimply
boys
as
young
as
ted
and
as
flabby
as
but
powerful
to
dance
and
to
mind
the
phonograph
and
smoke
cigarettes
and
patronize
tanis
he
tried
to
be
one
of
them
he
cried
good
work
pete
but
his
voice
creaked
tanis
apparently
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
the
dancing
darlings
she
bridled
to
their
bland
flirtation
and
casually
kissed
them
at
the
end
of
each
dance
babbitt
hated
her
for
the
moment
he
saw
her
as
he
studied
the
wrinkles
in
the
softness
of
her
throat
the
slack
flesh
beneath
her
chin
the
taut
muscles
of
her
youth
were
loose
and
drooping
between
dances
she
sat
in
the
largest
chair
waving
her
cigarette
summoning
her
callow
admirers
to
come
and
talk
to
her
she
thinks
she
a
blooming
queen
growled
babbitt
she
chanted
to
miss
sonntag
is
my
little
studio
sweet
studio
rats
it
a
plain
flat
oh
god
i
wish
i
was
home
i
wonder
if
i
ca
make
a
getaway
now
his
vision
grew
blurred
however
as
he
applied
himself
to
healey
hanson
raw
but
vigorous
whisky
he
blended
with
the
bunch
he
began
to
rejoice
that
carrie
nork
and
pete
the
most
nearly
intelligent
of
the
nimble
youths
seemed
to
like
him
and
it
was
enormously
important
to
win
over
the
surly
older
man
who
proved
to
be
a
railway
clerk
named
fulton
bemis
the
conversation
of
the
bunch
was
exclamatory
full
of
references
to
people
whom
babbitt
did
not
know
apparently
they
thought
very
comfortably
of
themselves
they
were
the
bunch
wise
and
beautiful
and
amusing
they
were
bohemians
and
urbanites
accustomed
to
all
the
luxuries
of
zenith
and
roadhouses
and
in
a
cynical
superiority
to
people
who
were
slow
or
tightwad
they
cackled
oh
pete
did
i
tell
you
what
that
dub
of
a
cashier
said
when
i
came
in
late
yesterday
oh
it
was
priceless
oh
but
was
stewed
say
he
was
simply
ossified
what
did
gladys
say
to
him
think
of
the
nerve
of
bob
bickerstaff
trying
to
get
us
to
come
to
his
house
say
the
nerve
of
him
can
you
beat
it
for
nerve
some
nerve
i
call
it
did
you
notice
how
dotty
was
dancing
gee
was
she
the
limit
babbitt
was
to
be
heard
sonorously
agreeing
with
the
miss
minnie
sonntag
that
persons
who
let
a
night
go
by
without
dancing
to
jazz
music
were
crabs
pikers
and
poor
fish
and
he
roared
you
bet
when
carrie
nork
gurgled
do
you
love
to
sit
on
the
floor
so
bohemian
he
began
to
think
extremely
well
of
the
bunch
when
he
mentioned
his
friends
sir
gerald
doak
lord
wycombe
william
washington
eathorne
and
chum
frink
he
was
proud
of
their
condescending
interest
he
got
so
thoroughly
into
the
jocund
spirit
that
he
did
much
mind
seeing
tanis
drooping
against
the
shoulder
of
the
youngest
and
milkiest
of
the
young
men
and
he
himself
desired
to
hold
carrie
nork
pulpy
hand
and
dropped
it
only
because
tanis
looked
angry
when
he
went
home
at
two
he
was
fully
a
member
of
the
bunch
and
all
the
week
thereafter
he
was
bound
by
the
exceedingly
straitened
conventions
the
exceedingly
wearing
demands
of
their
life
of
pleasure
and
freedom
he
had
to
go
to
their
parties
he
was
involved
in
the
agitation
when
everybody
telephoned
to
everybody
else
that
she
meant
what
she
said
when
she
said
that
and
anyway
why
was
pete
going
around
saying
she
said
it
never
was
a
family
more
insistent
on
learning
one
another
movements
than
were
the
bunch
all
of
them
volubly
knew
or
indignantly
desired
to
know
where
all
the
others
had
been
every
minute
of
the
week
babbitt
found
himself
explaining
to
carrie
or
fulton
bemis
just
what
he
had
been
doing
that
he
should
not
have
joined
them
till
ten
and
apologizing
for
having
gone
to
dinner
with
a
business
acquaintance
every
member
of
the
bunch
was
expected
to
telephone
to
every
other
member
at
least
once
a
week
why
have
you
called
me
up
babbitt
was
asked
accusingly
not
only
by
tanis
and
carrie
but
presently
by
new
ancient
friends
jennie
and
capitolina
and
toots
if
for
a
moment
he
had
seen
tanis
as
withering
and
sentimental
he
lost
that
impression
at
carrie
nork
dance
nork
had
a
large
house
and
a
small
husband
to
her
party
came
all
of
the
bunch
perhaps
of
them
when
they
were
completely
mobilized
babbitt
under
the
name
of
old
georgie
was
now
a
pioneer
of
the
bunch
since
each
month
it
changed
half
its
membership
and
he
who
could
recall
the
prehistoric
days
of
a
fortnight
ago
before
absolom
the
had
gone
to
indianapolis
and
mac
had
got
sore
at
minnie
was
a
venerable
leader
and
able
to
condescend
to
new
petes
and
minnies
and
gladyses
at
carrie
tanis
did
not
have
to
work
at
being
hostess
she
was
dignified
and
sure
a
clear
fine
figure
in
the
black
chiffon
frock
he
had
always
loved
and
in
the
wider
spaces
of
that
ugly
house
babbitt
was
able
to
sit
quietly
with
her
he
repented
of
his
first
revulsion
mooned
at
her
feet
and
happily
drove
her
home
next
day
he
bought
a
violent
yellow
tie
to
make
himself
young
for
her
he
knew
a
little
sadly
that
he
could
not
make
himself
beautiful
he
beheld
himself
as
heavy
hinting
of
fatness
but
he
danced
he
dressed
he
chattered
to
be
as
young
as
she
was
as
young
as
she
seemed
to
be
iv
as
all
converts
whether
to
a
religion
love
or
gardening
find
as
by
magic
that
though
hitherto
these
hobbies
have
not
seemed
to
exist
now
the
whole
world
is
filled
with
their
fury
so
once
he
was
converted
to
dissipation
babbitt
discovered
agreeable
opportunities
for
it
everywhere
he
had
a
new
view
of
his
sporting
neighbor
sam
doppelbrau
the
doppelbraus
were
respectable
people
industrious
people
prosperous
people
whose
ideal
of
happiness
was
an
eternal
cabaret
their
life
was
dominated
by
suburban
bacchanalia
of
alcohol
nicotine
gasoline
and
kisses
they
and
their
set
worked
capably
all
the
week
and
all
week
looked
forward
to
saturday
night
when
they
would
as
they
expressed
it
throw
a
party
and
the
thrown
party
grew
noisier
and
noisier
up
to
sunday
dawn
and
usually
included
an
extremely
rapid
motor
expedition
to
nowhere
in
particular
one
evening
when
tanis
was
at
the
theater
babbitt
found
himself
being
lively
with
the
doppelbraus
pledging
friendship
with
men
whom
he
had
for
years
privily
denounced
to
babbitt
as
a
rotten
bunch
of
that
i
would
go
out
with
not
if
they
were
the
last
people
on
that
evening
he
had
sulkily
come
home
and
poked
about
in
front
of
the
house
chipping
off
the
walk
the
like
fossil
footprints
made
by
the
steps
of
during
the
recent
snow
howard
littlefield
came
up
snuffling
still
a
widower
george
yump
cold
again
what
do

hear
from
the
wife
she
feeling
fine
but
her
sister
is
still
pretty
say
better
come
in
and
have
dinner
with
us
oh
oh
thanks
have
to
go
suddenly
he
could
not
endure
littlefield
recitals
of
the
more
interesting
statistics
about
totally
uninteresting
problems
he
scraped
at
the
walk
and
grunted
sam
doppelbrau
appeared
evenin
babbitt
working
hard
yuh
lil
cold
enough
for
you
well
just
still
a
widower
say
babbitt
while
she

care
much
for
but

missus

i
be
awfully
glad

fella

bet
old
uncle
george

mix
the
best
cocktail
in
these
united
states
hurray

the
way

folks

bottle
of
gin

while

and
jazz

little
just
for
a
change

at
nine
it
was
the
third
time
he
had
entered
the
house
by
ten
he
was
calling
doppelbrau
sam
old
at
eleven
they
all
drove
out
to
the
old
farm
inn
babbitt
sat
in
the
back
of
doppelbrau
car
with
louetta
swanson
once
he
had
timorously
tried
to
make
love
to
her
now
he
did
not
try
he
merely
made
love
and
louetta
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
told
him
what
a
nagger
eddie
was
and
accepted
babbitt
as
a
decent
and
libertine
with
the
assistance
of
tanis
bunch
the
doppelbraus
and
other
companions
in
forgetfulness
there
was
not
an
evening
for
two
weeks
when
he
did
not
return
home
late
and
shaky
with
his
other
faculties
blurred
he
yet
had
the
motorist
gift
of
being
able
to
drive
when
he
could
scarce
walk
of
slowing
down
at
corners
and
allowing
for
approaching
cars
he
came
wambling
into
the
house
if
verona
and
kenneth
escott
were
about
he
got
past
them
with
a
hasty
greeting
horribly
aware
of
their
level
young
glances
and
hid
himself
he
found
when
he
came
into
the
warm
house
that
he
was
hazier
than
he
had
believed
his
head
whirled
he
dared
not
lie
down
he
tried
to
soak
out
the
alcohol
in
a
hot
bath
for
the
moment
his
head
was
clearer
but
when
he
moved
about
the
bathroom
his
calculations
of
distance
were
wrong
so
that
he
dragged
down
the
towels
and
knocked
over
the
with
a
clatter
which
he
feared
would
betray
him
to
the
children
chilly
in
his
he
tried
to
read
the
evening
paper
he
could
follow
every
word
he
seemed
to
take
in
the
sense
of
things
but
a
minute
afterward
he
could
not
have
told
what
he
had
been
reading
when
he
went
to
bed
his
brain
flew
in
circles
and
he
hastily
sat
up
struggling
for
at
last
he
was
able
to
lie
still
feeling
only
a
little
sick
and
dizzy
and
enormously
ashamed
to
hide
his
condition
from
his
own
children
to
have
danced
and
shouted
with
people
whom
he
despised
to
have
said
foolish
things
sung
idiotic
songs
tried
to
kiss
silly
girls
incredulously
he
remembered
that
he
had
by
his
roaring
familiarity
with
them
laid
himself
open
to
the
patronizing
of
youths
whom
he
would
have
kicked
out
of
his
office
that
by
dancing
too
ardently
he
had
exposed
himself
to
rebukes
from
the
rattiest
of
withering
women
as
it
came
relentlessly
back
to
him
he
snarled
i
hate
myself
god
how
i
hate
myself
but
he
raged
i
through
no
more
had
enough
plenty
he
was
even
surer
about
it
the
morning
after
when
he
was
trying
to
be
grave
and
paternal
with
his
daughters
at
breakfast
at
noontime
he
was
less
sure
he
did
not
deny
that
he
had
been
a
fool
he
saw
it
almost
as
clearly
as
at
midnight
but
anything
he
struggled
was
better
than
going
back
to
a
life
of
barren
heartiness
at
four
he
wanted
a
drink
he
kept
a
whisky
flask
in
his
desk
now
and
after
two
minutes
of
battle
he
had
his
drink
three
drinks
later
he
began
to
see
the
bunch
as
tender
and
amusing
friends
and
by
six
he
was
with
them
and
the
tale
was
to
be
told
all
over
each
morning
his
head
ached
a
little
less
a
bad
head
for
drinks
had
been
his
safeguard
but
the
safeguard
was
crumbling
presently
he
could
be
drunk
at
dawn
yet
not
feel
particularly
wretched
in
his
conscience
or
in
his
stomach
when
he
awoke
at
eight
no
regret
no
desire
to
escape
the
toil
of
keeping
up
with
the
arduous
merriment
of
the
bunch
was
so
great
as
his
feeling
of
social
inferiority
when
he
failed
to
keep
up
to
be
the
livest
of
them
was
as
much
his
ambition
now
as
it
had
been
to
excel
at
making
money
at
playing
golf
at
at
oratory
at
climbing
to
the
mckelvey
set
but
occasionally
he
failed
he
found
that
pete
and
the
other
young
men
considered
the
bunch
too
austerely
polite
and
the
carrie
who
merely
kissed
behind
doors
too
embarrassingly
monogamic
as
babbitt
sneaked
from
floral
heights
down
to
the
bunch
so
the
young
gallants
sneaked
from
the
proprieties
of
the
bunch
off
to
times
with
bouncing
young
women
whom
they
picked
up
in
department
stores
and
at
hotel
coatrooms
once
babbitt
tried
to
accompany
them
there
was
a
motor
car
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
for
him
a
grubby
shrieking
from
parcher
and
stein
he
sat
beside
her
and
worried
he
was
apparently
expected
to
jolly
her
along
but
when
she
sang
out
hey
leggo
quit
crushing
me
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
go
on
they
sat
in
the
back
room
of
a
saloon
and
babbitt
had
a
headache
was
confused
by
their
new
slang
looked
at
them
benevolently
wanted
to
go
home
and
had
a
drink
a
good
many
drinks
two
evenings
after
fulton
bemis
the
surly
older
man
of
the
bunch
took
babbitt
aside
and
grunted
look
here
it
none
of
my
business
and
god
knows
i
always
lap
up
my
share
of
the
hootch
but
do
you
think
you
better
watch
yourself
you
one
of
these
enthusiastic
chumps
that
always
overdo
things
d
you
realize
you
throwing
in
the
booze
as
fast
as
you
can
and
you
eat
one
cigarette
right
after
another
better
cut
it
out
for
a
babbitt
tearfully
said
that
good
old
fult
was
a
prince
and
yes
he
certainly
would
cut
it
out
and
thereafter
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
took
a
drink
and
had
a
terrific
quarrel
with
tanis
when
she
caught
him
being
affectionate
with
carrie
nork
next
morning
he
hated
himself
that
he
should
have
sunk
into
a
position
where
a
like
fulton
bemis
could
rebuke
him
he
perceived
that
since
he
was
making
love
to
every
woman
possible
tanis
was
no
longer
his
one
pure
star
and
he
wondered
whether
she
had
ever
been
anything
more
to
him
than
a
woman
and
if
bemis
had
spoken
to
him
were
other
people
talking
about
him
he
suspiciously
watched
the
men
at
the
athletic
club
that
noon
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
uneasy
they
had
been
talking
about
him
then
he
was
angry
he
became
belligerent
he
not
only
defended
seneca
doane
but
even
made
fun
of
the
vergil
gunch
was
rather
brief
in
his
answers
afterward
babbitt
was
not
angry
he
was
afraid
he
did
not
go
to
the
next
lunch
of
the
boosters
club
but
hid
in
a
cheap
restaurant
and
while
he
munched
a
sandwich
and
sipped
coffee
from
a
cup
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
worried
four
days
later
when
the
bunch
were
having
one
of
their
best
parties
babbitt
drove
them
to
the
which
had
been
laid
out
on
the
chaloosa
river
after
a
thaw
the
streets
had
frozen
in
smooth
ice
down
those
wide
endless
streets
the
wind
rattled
between
the
rows
of
wooden
houses
and
the
whole
bellevue
district
seemed
a
frontier
town
even
with
skid
chains
on
all
four
wheels
babbitt
was
afraid
of
sliding
and
when
he
came
to
the
long
slide
of
a
hill
he
crawled
down
both
brakes
on
slewing
round
a
corner
came
a
less
cautious
car
it
skidded
it
almost
raked
them
with
its
rear
fenders
in
relief
at
their
escape
the
bunch
tanis
minnie
sonntag
pete
fulton
bemis
shouted
oh
baby
and
waved
their
hands
to
the
agitated
other
driver
then
babbitt
saw
professor
pumphrey
laboriously
crawling
up
hill
afoot
staring
owlishly
at
the
revelers
he
was
sure
that
pumphrey
recognized
him
and
saw
tanis
kiss
him
as
she
crowed
you
such
a
good
driver
at
lunch
next
day
he
probed
pumphrey
with
out
last
night
with
my
brother
and
some
friends
of
his
gosh
what
driving
slippery
glass
thought
i
saw
you
hiking
up
the
bellevue
avenue
no
i
was
i
did
see
you
said
pumphrey
hastily
rather
guiltily
perhaps
two
days
afterward
babbitt
took
tanis
to
lunch
at
the
hotel
thornleigh
she
who
had
seemed
well
content
to
wait
for
him
at
her
flat
had
begun
to
hint
with
melancholy
smiles
that
he
must
think
but
little
of
her
if
he
never
introduced
her
to
his
friends
if
he
was
unwilling
to
be
seen
with
her
except
at
the
movies
he
thought
of
taking
her
to
the
ladies
annex
of
the
athletic
club
but
that
was
too
dangerous
he
would
have
to
introduce
her
and
oh
people
might
misunderstand
and
he
compromised
on
the
thornleigh
she
was
unusually
smart
all
in
black
small
black
tricorne
hat
short
black
caracul
coat
loose
and
swinging
and
austere
black
velvet
frock
at
a
time
when
most
street
costumes
were
like
evening
gowns
perhaps
she
was
too
smart
every
one
in
the
gold
and
oak
restaurant
of
the
thornleigh
was
staring
at
her
as
babbitt
followed
her
to
a
table
he
uneasily
hoped
that
the
would
give
them
a
discreet
place
behind
a
pillar
but
they
were
stationed
on
the
center
aisle
tanis
seemed
not
to
notice
her
admirers
she
smiled
at
babbitt
with
a
lavish
oh
is
this
nice
what
a
orchestra
babbitt
had
difficulty
in
being
lavish
in
return
for
two
tables
away
he
saw
vergil
gunch
all
through
the
meal
gunch
watched
them
while
babbitt
watched
himself
being
watched
and
lugubriously
tried
to
keep
from
spoiling
tanis
gaiety
i
felt
like
a
spree
she
rippled
i
love
the
thornleigh
do
you
it
so
live
and
yet
so
so
he
made
talk
about
the
thornleigh
the
service
the
food
the
people
he
recognized
in
the
restaurant
all
but
vergil
gunch
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
else
to
talk
of
he
smiled
conscientiously
at
her
fluttering
jests
he
agreed
with
her
that
minnie
sonntag
was
so
hard
to
get
along
with
and
young
pete
such
a
silly
lazy
kid
really
just
no
good
at
but
he
himself
had
nothing
to
say
he
considered
telling
her
his
worries
about
gunch
but
oh
gosh
it
was
too
much
work
to
go
into
the
whole
thing
and
explain
about
verg
and
he
was
relieved
when
he
put
tanis
on
a
trolley
he
was
cheerful
in
the
familiar
simplicities
of
his
office
at
four
vergil
gunch
called
on
him
babbitt
was
agitated
but
gunch
began
in
a
friendly
way
how
the
boy
say
some
of
us
are
getting
up
a
scheme
we
kind
of
like
to
have
you
come
in
fine
verg
you
know
during
the
war
we
had
the
undesirable
element
the
reds
and
walking
delegates
and
just
the
plain
common
grouches
dead
to
rights
and
so
did
we
for
quite
a
while
after
the
war
but
folks
forget
about
the
danger
and
that
gives
these
cranks
a
chance
to
begin
working
underground
again
especially
a
lot
of
these
parlor
socialists
well
it
up
to
the
folks
that
do
a
little
sound
thinking
to
make
a
conscious
effort
to
keep
bucking
these
fellows
some
guy
back
east
has
organized
a
society
called
the
good
citizens
league
for
just
that
purpose
of
course
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
american
legion
and
so
on
do
a
fine
work
in
keeping
the
decent
people
in
the
saddle
but
devoted
to
so
many
other
causes
that
they
ca
attend
to
this
one
problem
properly
but
the
good
citizens
league
the
they
stick
right
to
it
oh
the
has
to
have
some
other
ostensible
purposes
frinstance
here
in
zenith
i
think
it
ought
to
support
the
project
and
the
city
planning
committee
and
then
too
it
should
have
a
social
aspect
being
made
up
of
the
best
people
have
dances
and
so
on
especially
as
one
of
the
best
ways
it
can
put
the
kibosh
on
cranks
is
to
apply
this
social
boycott
business
to
folks
big
enough
so
you
ca
reach
otherwise
then
if
that
do
work
the
can
finally
send
a
little
delegation
around
to
inform
folks
that
get
too
flip
that
they
got
to
conform
to
decent
standards
and
quit
shooting
off
their
mouths
so
free
do
it
sound
like
the
organization
could
do
a
great
work
we
already
got
some
of
the
strongest
men
in
town
and
of
course
we
want
you
in
how
about
it
babbitt
was
uncomfortable
he
felt
a
compulsion
back
to
all
the
standards
he
had
so
vaguely
yet
so
desperately
been
fleeing
he
fumbled
i
suppose
you
especially
light
on
fellows
like
seneca
doane
and
try
to
make
you
bet
your
sweet
life
we
would
look
here
old
georgie
i
never
for
one
moment
believed
you
meant
it
when
you
defended
doane
and
the
strikers
and
so
on
at
the
club
i
knew
you
were
simply
kidding
those
poor
galoots
like
sid
finkelstein
at
least
i
certainly
hope
you
were
kidding
oh
well
sure
course
you
might
say
babbitt
was
conscious
of
how
feeble
he
sounded
conscious
of
gunch
mature
and
relentless
eye
gosh
you
know
where
i
stand
i
no
labor
agitator
i
a
business
man
first
last
and
all
the
time
but
but
honestly
i
do
think
doane
means
so
badly
and
you
got
to
remember
he
an
old
friend
of
george
when
it
comes
right
down
to
a
struggle
between
decency
and
the
security
of
our
homes
on
the
one
hand
and
red
ruin
and
those
lazy
dogs
plotting
for
free
beer
on
the
other
you
got
to
give
up
even
old
friendships
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
i
suppose
how
about
it
going
to
join
us
in
the
good
citizens
league
i
have
to
think
it
over
all
right
just
as
you
babbitt
was
relieved
to
be
let
off
so
easily
but
gunch
went
on
george
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
none
of
us
do
and
we
talked
a
lot
about
you
for
a
while
we
figured
out
you
been
upset
by
what
happened
to
poor
riesling
and
we
forgave
you
for
any
fool
thing
you
said
but
that
old
stuff
now
george
and
we
ca
make
out
what
got
into
you
personally
i
always
defended
you
but
i
must
say
it
getting
too
much
for
me
all
the
boys
at
the
athletic
club
and
the
boosters
are
sore
the
way
you
go
on
deliberately
touting
doane
and
his
bunch
of
and
talking
about
being
liberal
which
means
being
and
even
saying
this
preacher
guy
ingram
is
a
professional
artist
and
then
the
way
you
been
carrying
on
personally
joe
pumphrey
says
he
saw
you
out
the
other
night
with
a
gang
of
totties
all
stewed
to
the
gills
and
here
coming
right
into
the
thornleigh
with
a
well
she
may
be
all
right
and
a
perfect
lady
but
she
certainly
did
look
like
a
pretty
gay
skirt
for
a
fellow
with
his
wife
out
of
town
to
be
taking
to
lunch
did
look
well
what
the
devil
has
come
over
you
george
strikes
me
there
a
lot
of
fellows
that
know
more
about
my
personal
business
than
i
do
myself
now
do
go
getting
sore
at
me
because
i
come
out
flatfooted
like
a
friend
and
say
what
i
think
instead
of
tattling
behind
your
back
the
way
a
whole
lot
of
do
i
tell
you
george
you
got
a
position
in
the
community
and
the
community
expects
you
to
live
up
to
it
and
better
think
over
joining
the
good
citizens
league
see
you
about
it
he
was
gone
that
evening
babbitt
dined
alone
he
saw
all
the
clan
of
good
fellows
peering
through
the
restaurant
window
spying
on
him
fear
sat
beside
him
and
he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
go
to
tanis
flat
and
he
did
not
go
till
late
chapter
xxx
i
the
summer
before
babbitt
letters
had
crackled
with
desire
to
return
to
zenith
now
they
said
nothing
of
returning
but
a
wistful
i
suppose
everything
is
going
on
all
right
without
me
among
her
dry
chronicles
of
weather
and
sicknesses
hinted
to
babbitt
that
he
been
very
urgent
about
her
coming
he
worried
it
if
she
were
here
and
i
went
on
raising
cain
like
i
been
doing
have
a
fit
i
got
to
get
hold
of
myself
i
got
to
learn
to
play
around
and
yet
not
make
a
fool
of
myself
i
can
do
it
too
if
folks
like
verg
gunch
let
me
alone
and
myra
stay
away
but
poor
kid
she
sounds
lonely
lord
i
do
want
to
hurt
her
impulsively
he
wrote
that
they
missed
her
and
her
next
letter
said
happily
that
she
was
coming
home
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
eager
to
see
her
he
bought
roses
for
the
house
he
ordered
squab
for
dinner
he
had
the
car
cleaned
and
polished
all
the
way
home
from
the
station
with
her
he
was
adequate
in
his
accounts
of
ted
success
in
at
the
university
but
before
they
reached
floral
heights
there
was
nothing
more
to
say
and
already
he
felt
the
force
of
her
stolidity
wondered
whether
he
could
remain
a
good
husband
and
still
sneak
out
of
the
house
this
evening
for
half
an
hour
with
the
bunch
when
he
had
housed
the
car
he
blundered
upstairs
into
the
familiar
warmth
of
her
presence
blaring
help
you
unpack
your
bag
no
i
can
do
slowly
she
turned
holding
up
a
small
box
and
slowly
she
said
i
brought
you
a
present
just
a
new
i
do
know
if
you
care
to
have
it
she
was
the
lonely
girl
the
brown
appealing
myra
thompson
whom
he
had
married
and
he
almost
wept
for
pity
as
he
kissed
her
and
besought
oh
honey
honey
care
to
have
it
of
course
i
do
i
awful
proud
you
brought
it
to
me
and
i
needed
a
new
case
he
wondered
how
he
would
get
rid
of
the
case
he
had
bought
the
week
before
and
you
really
are
glad
to
see
me
back
why
you
poor
kiddy
what
you
been
worrying
about
well
you
did
seem
to
miss
me
very
by
the
time
he
had
finished
his
stint
of
lying
they
were
firmly
bound
again
by
ten
that
evening
it
seemed
improbable
that
she
had
ever
been
away
there
was
but
one
difference
the
problem
of
remaining
a
respectable
husband
a
floral
heights
husband
yet
seeing
tanis
and
the
bunch
with
frequency
he
had
promised
to
telephone
to
tanis
that
evening
and
now
it
was
melodramatically
impossible
he
prowled
about
the
telephone
impulsively
thrusting
out
a
hand
to
lift
the
receiver
but
never
quite
daring
to
risk
it
nor
could
he
find
a
reason
for
slipping
down
to
the
drug
store
on
smith
street
with
its
he
was
laden
with
responsibility
till
he
threw
it
off
with
the
speculation
why
the
deuce
should
i
fret
so
about
not
being
able
to
tanis
she
can
get
along
without
me
i
do
owe
her
anything
she
a
fine
girl
but
i
given
her
just
as
much
as
she
has
me
oh
damn
these
women
and
the
way
they
get
you
all
tied
up
in
complications
ii
for
a
week
he
was
attentive
to
his
wife
took
her
to
the
theater
to
dinner
at
the
littlefields
then
the
old
weary
dodging
and
shifting
began
and
at
least
two
evenings
a
week
he
spent
with
the
bunch
he
still
made
pretense
of
going
to
the
elks
and
to
but
less
and
less
did
he
trouble
to
have
his
excuses
interesting
less
and
less
did
she
affect
to
believe
them
he
was
certain
that
she
knew
he
was
associating
with
what
floral
heights
called
a
sporty
crowd
yet
neither
of
them
acknowledged
it
in
matrimonial
geography
the
distance
between
the
first
mute
recognition
of
a
break
and
the
admission
thereof
is
as
great
as
the
distance
between
the
first
naive
faith
and
the
first
doubting
as
he
began
to
drift
away
he
also
began
to
see
her
as
a
human
being
to
like
and
dislike
her
instead
of
accepting
her
as
a
comparatively
movable
part
of
the
furniture
and
he
compassionated
that
relation
which
in
years
of
married
life
had
become
a
separate
and
real
entity
he
recalled
their
high
lights
the
summer
vacation
in
virginia
meadows
under
the
blue
wall
of
the
mountains
their
motor
tour
through
ohio
and
the
exploration
of
cleveland
cincinnati
and
columbus
the
birth
of
verona
their
building
of
this
new
house
planned
to
comfort
them
through
a
happy
old
age
chokingly
they
had
said
that
it
might
be
the
last
home
either
of
them
would
ever
have
yet
his
most
softening
remembrance
of
these
dear
moments
did
not
keep
him
from
barking
at
dinner
yep
going
out
f
few
hours
do
sit
up
for
he
did
not
dare
now
to
come
home
drunk
and
though
he
rejoiced
in
his
return
to
high
morality
and
spoke
with
gravity
to
pete
and
fulton
bemis
about
their
drinking
he
prickled
at
myra
unexpressed
criticisms
and
sulkily
meditated
that
a
fellow
could
ever
learn
to
handle
himself
if
he
was
always
bossed
by
a
lot
of
he
no
longer
wondered
if
tanis
was
a
bit
worn
and
sentimental
in
contrast
to
the
complacent
myra
he
saw
her
as
swift
and
and
radiant
a
tenderly
stooping
to
the
hearth
and
however
pitifully
he
brooded
on
his
wife
he
longed
to
be
with
tanis
then
babbitt
tore
the
decent
cloak
from
her
unhappiness
and
the
astounded
male
discovered
that
she
was
having
a
small
determined
rebellion
of
her
own
iii
they
were
beside
the
fireless
in
the
evening
georgie
she
said
you
have
given
me
the
list
of
your
household
expenses
while
i
was
no
i
have
made
it
out
very
affably
gosh
we
must
try
to
keep
down
expenses
this
that
so
i
do
know
where
all
the
money
goes
to
i
try
to
economize
but
it
just
seems
to
i
suppose
i
ought
to
spend
so
much
on
cigars
do
know
but
what
i
cut
down
my
smoking
maybe
cut
it
out
entirely
i
was
thinking
of
a
good
way
to
do
it
the
other
day
start
on
these
cubeb
cigarettes
and
they
kind
of
disgust
me
with
oh
i
do
wish
you
would
it
is
that
i
care
but
honestly
george
it
is
so
bad
for
you
to
smoke
so
much
do
you
think
you
could
reduce
the
amount
and
george
i
notice
now
when
you
come
home
from
these
lodges
and
all
that
sometimes
you
smell
of
whisky
dearie
you
know
i
worry
so
much
about
the
moral
side
of
it
but
you
have
a
weak
stomach
and
you
ca
stand
all
this
weak
stomach
hell
i
guess
i
can
carry
my
booze
about
as
well
as
most
folks
well
i
do
think
you
ought
to
be
careful
do
you
see
dear
i
want
you
to
get
sick
rats
i
not
a
baby
i
guess
i
ai
going
to
get
sick
just
because
maybe
once
a
week
i
shoot
a
highball
that
the
trouble
with
women
they
always
exaggerate
george
i
do
think
you
ought
to
talk
that
way
when
i
just
speaking
for
your
own
i
know
but
gosh
all
fishhooks
that
the
trouble
with
women
always
criticizing
and
commenting
and
bringing
things
up
and
then
they
say
it
your
own
good
why
george
that
not
a
nice
way
to
talk
to
answer
me
so
well
i
did
mean
to
answer
short
but
gosh
talking
as
if
i
was
a
kindergarten
brat
not
able
to
tote
one
highball
without
calling
for
the
mary
ambulance
a
fine
idea
you
must
have
of
me
oh
it
is
that
it
just
i
do
want
to
see
you
get
sick
and
my
i
did
know
it
was
so
late
do
forget
to
give
me
those
household
accounts
for
the
time
while
i
was
oh
thunder
what
the
use
of
taking
the
trouble
to
make
out
now
let
just
skip
for
that
why
george
babbitt
in
all
the
years
we
been
married
we
never
failed
to
keep
a
complete
account
of
every
penny
we
spent
no
maybe
that
the
trouble
with
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
oh
i
do
mean
anything
only
sometimes
i
get
so
darn
sick
and
tired
of
all
this
routine
and
the
accounting
at
the
office
and
expenses
at
home
and
fussing
and
stewing
and
fretting
and
wearing
myself
out
worrying
over
a
lot
of
junk
that
does
really
mean
a
doggone
thing
and
being
so
careful
and
good
lord
what
do
you
think
i
made
for
i
could
have
been
a
darn
good
orator
and
here
i
fuss
and
fret
and
worry
do
you
suppose
i
ever
get
tired
of
fussing
i
get
so
bored
with
ordering
three
meals
a
day
three
hundred
and
days
a
year
and
ruining
my
eyes
over
that
horrid
and
looking
after
your
clothes
and
rone
and
ted
and
tinka
and
everybody
and
the
laundry
and
darning
socks
and
going
down
to
the
piggly
wiggly
to
market
and
bringing
my
basket
home
to
save
money
on
the
and
everything
well
gosh
with
a
certain
astonishment
i
suppose
maybe
you
do
but
talk
about
here
i
have
to
be
in
the
office
every
single
day
while
you
can
go
out
all
afternoon
and
see
folks
and
visit
with
the
neighbors
and
do
any
blinkin
thing
you
want
to
yes
and
a
fine
lot
of
good
that
does
me
just
talking
over
the
same
old
things
with
the
same
old
crowd
while
you
have
all
sorts
of
interesting
people
coming
in
to
see
you
at
the
interesting
cranky
old
dames
that
want
to
know
why
i
have
rented
their
dear
precious
homes
for
about
seven
times
their
value
and
bunch
of
old
crabs
panning
the
everlasting
daylights
out
of
me
because
they
do
receive
every
cent
of
their
rentals
by
three
on
the
second
of
the
month
sure
interesting
just
as
interesting
as
the
small
pox
now
george
i
will
not
have
you
shouting
at
me
that
way
well
it
gets
my
goat
the
way
women
figure
out
that
a
man
does
do
a
darn
thing
but
sit
on
his
chair
and
have
conferences
with
a
lot
of
classy
dames
and
give
the
glad
eye
i
guess
you
manage
to
give
them
a
glad
enough
eye
when
they
do
come
what
do
you
mean
mean
i
chasing
flappers
i
should
hope
not
at
your
age
now
you
look
here
you
may
not
believe
it
of
course
all
you
see
is
fat
little
georgie
babbitt
sure
handy
man
around
the
house
fixes
the
furnace
when
the
does
show
up
and
pays
the
bills
but
dull
awful
dull
well
you
may
not
believe
it
but
there
some
women
that
think
old
george
babbitt
is
such
a
bad
scout
they
think
not
so
not
so
bad
that
it
hurts
anyway
and
he
got
a
pretty
good
line
of
guff
and
some
even
think
he
shakes
a
darn
wicked
walkover
at
dancing
she
spoke
slowly
i
have
much
doubt
that
when
i
away
you
manage
to
find
people
who
properly
appreciate
well
i
just
mean
he
protested
with
a
sound
of
denial
then
he
was
angered
into
you
bet
i
do
i
find
plenty
of
folks
and
doggone
nice
ones
that
do
think
i
a
baby
that
exactly
what
i
was
saying
you
can
run
around
with
anybody
you
please
but
i
supposed
to
sit
here
and
wait
for
you
you
have
the
chance
to
get
all
sorts
of
culture
and
everything
and
i
just
stay
home
well
gosh
almighty
there
nothing
to
prevent
your
reading
books
and
going
to
lectures
and
all
that
junk
is
there
george
i
told
you
i
wo
have
you
shouting
at
me
like
that
i
know
what
come
over
you
you
never
used
to
speak
to
me
in
this
cranky
i
did
mean
to
sound
cranky
but
gosh
it
certainly
makes
me
sore
to
get
the
blame
because
you
do
keep
up
with
i
going
to
will
you
help
me
sure
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
in
the
line
yours
to
oblige
very
well
then
i
want
you
to
go
to
mudge
new
thought
meeting
with
me
next
sunday
mrs
who
which
mrs
opal
emerson
mudge
the
for
the
american
new
thought
league
she
going
to
speak
on
the
sun
before
the
league
of
the
higher
illumination
at
the
oh
punk
new
thought
hashed
thought
with
a
poached
egg
the
it
sounds
like
is
a
mouse
when
it
spins
that
a
fine
spiel
for
a
good
presbyterian
to
be
going
to
when
you
can
hear
doc
drew
reverend
drew
is
a
scholar
and
a
pulpit
orator
and
all
that
but
he
has
got
the
inner
ferment
as
mudge
calls
it
he
has
any
inspiration
for
the
new
era
women
need
inspiration
now
so
i
want
you
to
come
as
you
iv
the
zenith
branch
of
the
league
of
the
higher
illumination
met
in
the
smaller
ballroom
at
the
hotel
thornleigh
a
refined
apartment
with
pale
green
walls
and
plaster
wreaths
of
roses
refined
parquet
flooring
and
frail
gilt
chairs
here
were
gathered
women
and
ten
men
most
of
the
men
slouched
in
their
chairs
and
wriggled
while
their
wives
sat
rigidly
at
attention
but
two
of
them
meaty
men
were
as
respectably
devout
as
their
wives
they
were
newly
rich
contractors
who
having
bought
houses
motors
pictures
and
gentlemanliness
were
now
buying
a
refined
philosophy
it
had
been
a
with
them
whether
to
buy
new
thought
christian
science
or
a
good
standard
model
of
episcopalianism
in
the
flesh
opal
emerson
mudge
fell
somewhat
short
of
a
prophetic
aspect
she
was
and
plump
with
the
face
of
a
haughty
pekingese
a
button
of
a
nose
and
arms
so
short
that
despite
her
most
indignant
endeavors
she
could
not
clasp
her
hands
in
front
of
her
as
she
sat
on
the
platform
waiting
her
frock
of
taffeta
and
green
velvet
with
three
strings
of
glass
beads
and
large
folding
dangling
from
a
black
ribbon
was
a
triumph
of
refinement
mudge
was
introduced
by
the
president
of
the
league
of
the
higher
illumination
an
oldish
young
woman
with
a
yearning
voice
white
spats
and
a
mustache
she
said
that
mudge
would
now
make
it
plain
to
the
simplest
intellect
how
the
sun
spirit
could
be
cultivated
and
they
who
had
been
thinking
about
cultivating
one
would
do
well
to
treasure
mudge
words
because
even
zenith
and
everybody
knew
that
zenith
stood
in
the
van
of
spiritual
and
new
thought
progress
did
often
have
the
opportunity
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
such
an
inspiring
optimist
and
metaphysical
seer
as
opal
emerson
mudge
who
had
lived
the
life
of
wider
usefulness
through
concentration
and
in
the
silence
found
those
secrets
of
mental
control
and
the
inner
key
which
were
immediately
going
to
transform
and
bring
peace
power
and
prosperity
to
the
unhappy
nations
and
so
friends
would
they
for
this
precious
hour
forget
the
illusions
of
the
seeming
real
and
in
the
actualization
of
the
veritas
pass
along
with
opal
emerson
mudge
to
the
realm
beautiful
if
mudge
was
rather
pudgier
than
one
would
like
one
swamis
yogis
seers
and
initiates
yet
her
voice
had
the
real
professional
note
it
was
refined
and
optimistic
it
was
overpoweringly
calm
it
flowed
on
relentlessly
without
one
comma
till
babbitt
was
hypnotized
her
favorite
word
was
always
which
she
pronounced
her
principal
gesture
was
a
pontifical
but
thoroughly
ladylike
blessing
with
two
stubby
fingers
she
explained
about
this
matter
of
spiritual
saturation
there
are
those
of
those
she
made
a
linked
sweetness
long
drawn
out
a
delicate
call
in
a
twilight
minor
it
chastely
rebuked
the
restless
husbands
yet
brought
them
a
message
of
healing
there
are
those
who
have
seen
the
rim
and
outer
seeming
of
the
logos
there
are
those
who
have
glimpsed
and
in
enthusiasm
possessed
themselves
of
some
segment
and
portion
of
the
logos
there
are
those
who
thus
flicked
but
not
penetrated
and
radioactivated
by
the
dynamis
go
always
to
and
fro
assertative
that
they
possess
and
are
possessed
of
the
logos
and
the
metaphysikos
but
this
word
i
bring
you
this
concept
i
enlarge
that
those
that
are
not
utter
are
not
even
inceptive
and
that
holiness
is
in
its
definitive
essence
always
always
always
and
it
proved
that
the
essence
of
the
sun
spirit
was
truth
but
its
aura
and
effluxion
were
cheerfulness
face
always
the
day
with
the
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
initiate
who
perceives
that
all
works
together
in
the
revolutions
of
the
wheel
and
who
answers
the
strictures
of
the
soured
souls
of
the
destructionists
with
a
glad
affirmation
it
went
on
for
about
an
hour
and
seven
minutes
at
the
end
mudge
spoke
with
more
vigor
and
punctuation
now
let
me
suggest
to
all
of
you
the
advantages
of
the
theosophical
and
pantheistic
oriental
reading
circle
which
i
represent
our
object
is
to
unite
all
the
manifestations
of
the
new
era
into
one
cohesive
whole
new
thought
christian
science
theosophy
vedanta
bahaism
and
the
other
sparks
from
the
one
new
light
the
subscription
is
but
ten
dollars
a
year
and
for
this
mere
pittance
the
members
receive
not
only
the
monthly
magazine
pearls
of
healing
but
the
privilege
of
sending
right
to
the
president
our
revered
mother
dobbs
any
questions
regarding
spiritual
progress
matrimonial
problems
health
and
questions
financial
difficulties
and
they
listened
to
her
with
adoring
attention
they
looked
genteel
they
looked
they
coughed
politely
and
crossed
their
legs
with
quietness
and
in
expensive
linen
handkerchiefs
they
blew
their
noses
with
a
delicacy
altogether
optimistic
and
refined
as
for
babbitt
he
sat
and
suffered
when
they
were
blessedly
out
in
the
air
again
when
they
drove
home
through
a
wind
smelling
of
snow
and
honest
sun
he
dared
not
speak
they
had
been
too
near
to
quarreling
these
days
babbitt
forced
it
did
you
enjoy
mudge
talk
well
i
what
did
you
get
out
of
it
oh
it
starts
a
person
thinking
it
gets
you
out
of
a
routine
of
ordinary
well
i
hand
it
to
opal
she
is
ordinary
but
gosh
honest
did
that
stuff
mean
anything
to
you
of
course
i
not
trained
in
metaphysics
and
there
was
lots
i
quite
grasp
but
i
did
feel
it
was
inspiring
and
she
speaks
so
readily
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
got
something
out
of
well
i
did
i
swear
i
was
simply
astonished
the
way
those
women
lapped
it
up
why
the
dickens
they
want
to
put
in
their
time
listening
to
all
that
blaa
when
they
it
certainly
better
for
them
than
going
to
roadhouses
and
smoking
and
drinking
i
do
know
whether
it
is
or
not
personally
i
do
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
in
both
cases
they
trying
to
get
away
from
themselves
most
everybody
is
these
days
i
guess
and
i
certainly
get
a
whole
lot
more
out
of
hoofing
it
in
a
good
lively
dance
even
in
some
dive
than
sitting
looking
as
if
my
collar
was
too
tight
and
feeling
too
scared
to
spit
and
listening
to
opal
chewing
her
i
sure
you
do
you
very
fond
of
dives
no
doubt
you
saw
a
lot
of
them
while
i
was
away
look
here
you
been
doing
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
insinuating
and
hinting
around
lately
as
if
i
were
leading
a
double
life
or
something
and
damn
sick
of
it
and
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
it
why
george
babbitt
do
you
realize
what
you
saying
why
george
in
all
our
years
together
you
never
talked
to
me
like
that
it
about
time
then
lately
you
been
getting
worse
and
worse
and
now
finally
cursing
and
swearing
at
me
and
shouting
at
me
and
your
voice
so
ugly
and
hateful
i
just
shudder
oh
rats
quit
exaggerating
i
was
shouting
or
swearing
i
wish
you
could
hear
your
own
voice
maybe
you
do
realize
how
it
sounds
but
even
so
you
never
used
to
talk
like
that
you
simply
could
talk
this
way
if
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
his
mind
was
hard
with
amazement
he
found
that
he
was
particularly
sorry
it
was
only
with
an
effort
that
he
made
himself
more
agreeable
well
gosh
i
did
mean
to
get
george
do
you
realize
that
we
ca
go
on
like
this
getting
farther
and
farther
apart
and
you
ruder
and
ruder
to
me
i
just
do
know
what
going
to
he
had
a
moment
pity
for
her
bewilderment
he
thought
of
how
many
deep
and
tender
things
would
be
hurt
if
they
really
could
go
on
like
but
his
pity
was
impersonal
and
he
was
wondering
would
it
maybe
be
a
good
thing
if
not
a
divorce
and
all
that
o
course
but
kind
of
a
little
more
independence
while
she
looked
at
him
pleadingly
he
drove
on
in
a
dreadful
silence
chapter
xxxi
i
when
he
was
away
from
her
while
he
kicked
about
the
garage
and
swept
the
snow
off
the
and
examined
a
cracked
he
repented
he
was
alarmed
and
astonished
that
he
could
have
flared
out
at
his
wife
and
thought
fondly
how
much
more
lasting
she
was
than
the
flighty
bunch
he
went
in
to
mumble
that
he
was
sorry
did
mean
to
be
grouchy
and
to
inquire
as
to
her
interest
in
movies
but
in
the
darkness
of
the
movie
theater
he
brooded
that
he
gone
and
tied
himself
up
to
myra
all
over
he
had
some
satisfaction
in
taking
it
out
on
tanis
judique
hang
tanis
anyway
why
she
gone
and
got
him
into
these
and
made
him
all
jumpy
and
nervous
and
cranky
too
many
complications
cut
out
he
wanted
peace
for
ten
days
he
did
not
see
tanis
nor
telephone
to
her
and
instantly
she
put
upon
him
the
compulsion
which
he
hated
when
he
had
stayed
away
from
her
for
five
days
hourly
taking
pride
in
his
resoluteness
and
hourly
picturing
how
greatly
tanis
must
miss
him
miss
mcgoun
reported
mrs
judique

thursday
the
of
tanis
note
was
full
of
emotional
crises
at
the
roughnecks
table
at
the
club
verg
gunch
talked
of
the
good
citizens
league
and
it
seemed
to
babbitt
deliberately
left
him
out
of
the
invitations
to
join
old
mat
penniman
the
general
utility
man
at
babbitt
office
had
troubles
and
came
in
to
groan
about
them
his
oldest
boy
was
no
good
his
wife
was
sick
and
he
had
quarreled
with
his
conrad
lyte
also
had
troubles
and
since
lyte
was
one
of
his
best
clients
babbitt
had
to
listen
to
them
lyte
it
appeared
was
suffering
from
a
peculiarly
interesting
neuralgia
and
the
garage
had
overcharged
him
when
babbitt
came
home
everybody
had
troubles
his
wife
was
simultaneously
thinking
about
discharging
the
impudent
new
maid
and
worried
lest
the
maid
leave
and
tinka
desired
to
denounce
her
teacher
oh
quit
fussing
babbitt
fussed
you
never
hear
me
whining
about
my
troubles
and
yet
if
you
had
to
run
a
office
why
i
found
miss
bannigan
was
two
days
behind
with
her
accounts
and
i
pinched
my
finger
in
my
desk
and
lyte
was
in
and
just
as
unreasonable
as
he
was
so
vexed
that
after
dinner
when
it
was
time
for
a
tactful
escape
to
tanis
he
merely
grumped
to
his
wife
got
to
go
out
be
back
by
eleven
should
oh
you
going
out
again
again
what
do
you
mean
have
hardly
been
out
of
the
house
for
a
week
are
you
are
you
going
to
the
elks
nope
got
to
see
some
though
this
time
he
heard
his
own
voice
and
knew
that
it
was
curt
though
she
was
looking
at
him
with
reproach
he
stumped
into
the
hall
jerked
on
his
ulster
and
furlined
gloves
and
went
out
to
start
the
car
he
was
relieved
to
find
tanis
cheerful
unreproachful
and
brilliant
in
a
frock
of
brown
net
over
gold
tissue
you
poor
man
having
to
come
out
on
a
night
like
this
it
terribly
cold
do
you
think
a
small
highball
would
be
nice
now
by
golly
there
a
woman
with
savvy
i
think
we
could
more
or
less
stand
a
highball
if
it
was
too
long
a
one
not
over
a
foot
tall
he
kissed
her
with
careless
heartiness
he
forgot
the
compulsion
of
her
demands
he
stretched
in
a
large
chair
and
felt
that
he
had
beautifully
come
home
he
was
suddenly
loquacious
he
told
her
what
a
noble
and
misunderstood
man
he
was
and
how
superior
to
pete
fulton
bemis
and
the
other
men
of
their
acquaintance
and
she
bending
forward
chin
in
charming
hand
brightly
agreed
but
when
he
forced
himself
to
ask
well
honey
how
things
with
you
she
took
his
seriously
and
he
discovered
that
she
too
had
troubles
oh
all
right
but
i
did
get
so
angry
with
carrie
she
told
minnie
that
i
told
her
that
minnie
was
an
awful
tightwad
and
minnie
told
me
carrie
had
told
her
and
of
course
i
told
her
i
had
said
anything
of
the
kind
and
then
carrie
found
minnie
had
told
me
and
she
was
simply
furious
because
minnie
had
told
me
and
of
course
i
was
just
boiling
because
carrie
had
told
her
i
told
her
and
then
we
all
met
up
at
fulton
his
wife
is
away
thank
heavens
oh
there
the
dandiest
floor
in
his
house
to
dance
on
and
we
were
all
of
us
simply
furious
at
each
other
and
oh
i
do
hate
that
kind
of
a
do
you
i
mean
it
so
lacking
in
refinement
but
and
mother
wants
to
come
and
stay
with
me
for
a
whole
month
and
of
course
i
do
love
her
i
suppose
i
do
but
honestly
she
cramp
my
style
something
dreadful
she
never
can
learn
not
to
comment
and
she
always
wants
to
know
where
i
going
when
i
go
out
evenings
and
if
i
lie
to
her
she
always
spies
around
and
ferrets
around
and
finds
out
where
i
been
and
then
she
looks
like
patience
on
a
monument
till
i
could
just
scream
and
oh
i
must
tell
you
you
know
i
never
talk
about
myself
i
just
hate
people
who
do
do
you
but
i
feel
so
stupid
and
i
know
i
must
be
boring
you
with
all
this
but
what
would
you
do
about
mother
he
gave
her
facile
masculine
advice
she
was
to
put
off
her
stay
she
was
to
tell
carrie
to
go
to
the
deuce
for
these
valuable
revelations
she
thanked
him
and
they
ambled
into
the
familiar
gossip
of
the
bunch
of
what
a
sentimental
fool
was
carrie
of
what
a
lazy
brat
was
pete
of
how
nice
fulton
bemis
could
be
course
lots
of
people
think
he
a
regular
old
grouch
when
they
meet
him
because
he
give
the
glad
hand
the
first
crack
out
of
the
box
but
when
they
get
to
know
him
he
a
but
as
they
had
gone
conscientiously
through
each
of
these
analyses
before
the
conversation
staggered
babbitt
tried
to
be
intellectual
and
deal
with
general
topics
he
said
some
thoroughly
sound
things
about
disarmament
and
and
liberalism
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
general
topics
interested
tanis
only
when
she
could
apply
them
to
pete
carrie
or
themselves
he
was
distressingly
conscious
of
their
silence
he
tried
to
stir
her
into
chattering
again
but
silence
rose
like
a
gray
presence
and
hovered
between
them
i
uh
he
labored
it
strikes
me
it
strikes
me
that
unemployment
is
maybe
pete
will
get
a
decent
job
silence
desperately
he
essayed
what
the
trouble
old
honey
you
seem
kind
of
quiet
am
i
oh
i
not
but
do
you
really
care
whether
i
am
or
not
care
sure
course
i
do
do
you
really
she
swooped
on
him
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
hated
the
emotional
drain
of
having
to
appear
fond
of
her
he
stroked
her
hand
smiled
up
at
her
dutifully
and
sank
back
george
i
wonder
if
you
really
like
me
at
all
course
i
do
do
you
really
precious
do
you
care
a
bit
why
certainly
you
do
suppose
i
be
here
if
i
did
now
see
here
young
man
i
wo
have
you
speaking
to
me
in
that
huffy
way
i
did
mean
to
sound
huffy
i
just
in
injured
and
rather
childish
tones
gosh
almighty
it
makes
me
tired
the
way
everybody
says
i
sound
huffy
when
i
just
talk
natural
do
they
expect
me
to
sing
it
or
something
who
do
you
mean
by
how
many
other
ladies
have
you
been
consoling
look
here
now
i
wo
have
this
hinting
humbly
i
know
dear
i
was
only
teasing
i
know
it
did
mean
to
talk
huffy
it
was
just
tired
forgive
bad
tanis
but
say
you
love
me
say
it
i
love
you
course
i
yes
you
do
cynically
oh
darling
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
get
so
lonely
i
feel
so
useless
nobody
needs
me
nothing
i
can
do
for
anybody
and
you
know
dear
i
so
active
i
could
be
if
there
was
something
to
do
and
i
am
young
are
i
i
not
an
old
thing
i
not
old
and
stupid
am
i
he
had
to
assure
her
she
stroked
his
hair
and
he
had
to
look
pleased
under
that
touch
the
more
demanding
in
its
beguiling
softness
he
was
impatient
he
wanted
to
flee
out
to
a
hard
sure
unemotional
through
her
delicate
and
caressing
fingers
she
may
have
caught
something
of
his
shrugging
distaste
she
left
him
he
was
for
the
moment
buoyantly
relieved
she
dragged
a
footstool
to
his
feet
and
sat
looking
beseechingly
up
at
him
but
as
in
many
men
the
cringing
of
a
dog
the
flinching
of
a
frightened
child
rouse
not
pity
but
a
surprised
and
jerky
cruelty
so
her
humility
only
annoyed
him
and
he
saw
her
now
as
as
beginning
to
be
old
even
while
he
detested
his
own
thoughts
they
rode
him
she
was
old
he
winced
old
he
noted
how
the
soft
flesh
was
creasing
into
webby
folds
beneath
her
chin
below
her
eyes
at
the
base
of
her
wrists
a
patch
of
her
throat
had
a
minute
roughness
like
the
crumbs
from
a
rubber
eraser
old
she
was
younger
in
years
than
himself
yet
it
was
sickening
to
have
her
yearning
up
at
him
with
rolling
great
eyes
as
if
he
shuddered
his
own
aunt
were
making
love
to
him
he
fretted
inwardly
i
through
with
this
asinine
fooling
around
going
to
cut
her
out
she
a
darn
decent
nice
woman
and
i
do
want
to
hurt
her
but
it
hurt
a
lot
less
to
cut
her
right
out
like
a
good
clean
surgical
he
was
on
his
feet
he
was
speaking
urgently
by
every
rule
of
he
had
to
prove
to
her
and
to
himself
that
it
was
her
fault
i
suppose
maybe
i
kind
of
out
of
sorts
but
honest
honey
when
i
stayed
away
for
a
while
to
catch
up
on
work
and
everything
and
figure
out
where
i
was
at
you
ought
to
have
been
cannier
and
waited
till
i
came
back
ca
you
see
dear
when
you
made
me
come
i
being
about
an
average
chump
my
tendency
was
to
resist
listen
dear
i
going
now
not
for
a
while
precious
no
yep
right
now
and
then
sometime
we
see
about
the
what
do
you
mean
dear
the
future
have
i
done
something
i
ought
to
oh
i
so
dreadfully
sorry
he
resolutely
put
his
hands
behind
him
not
a
thing
god
bless
you
not
a
thing
you
as
good
as
they
make
but
it
just
good
lord
do
you
realize
i
got
things
to
do
in
the
world
i
got
a
business
to
attend
to
and
you
might
not
believe
it
but
i
got
a
wife
and
kids
that
i
awful
fond
of
then
only
during
the
murder
he
was
committing
was
he
able
to
feel
nobly
virtuous
i
want
us
to
be
friends
but
gosh
i
ca
go
on
this
way
feeling
i
got
to
come
up
here
every
so
often
oh
darling
darling
and
i
always
told
you
so
carefully
that
you
were
absolutely
free
i
just
wanted
you
to
come
around
when
you
were
tired
and
wanted
to
talk
to
me
or
when
you
could
enjoy
our
parties
she
was
so
reasonable
she
was
so
gently
right
it
took
him
an
hour
to
make
his
escape
with
nothing
settled
and
everything
horribly
settled
in
a
barren
freedom
of
icy
northern
wind
he
sighed
thank
god
over
poor
tanis
poor
darling
decent
tanis
but
it
is
over
absolute
i
free
chapter
xxxii
i
his
wife
was
up
when
he
came
in
did
you
have
a
good
time
she
sniffed
i
did
not
i
had
a
rotten
time
anything
else
i
got
to
explain
george
how
can
you
speak
like
oh
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
good
lord
there
nothing
come
over
me
why
do
you
look
for
trouble
all
the
time
he
was
warning
himself
careful
stop
being
so
disagreeable
course
she
feels
it
being
left
alone
here
all
but
he
forgot
his
warning
as
she
went
on
why
do
you
go
out
and
see
all
sorts
of
strange
people
i
suppose
say
you
been
to
another
this
evening
nope
i
been
calling
on
a
woman
we
sat
by
the
fire
and
kidded
each
other
and
had
a
whale
of
a
good
time
if
you
want
to
know
well
from
the
way
you
say
it
i
suppose
it
my
fault
you
went
there
i
probably
sent
you
you
did
well
upon
my
word
you
hate
people
as
you
call
if
you
had
your
way
i
be
as
much
of
an
old
as
howard
littlefield
you
never
want
to
have
anybody
with
any
git
to
at
the
house
you
want
a
bunch
of
old
stiffs
that
sit
around
and
gas
about
the
weather
you
doing
your
level
best
to
make
me
old
well
let
me
tell
you
i
not
going
to
have
overwhelmed
she
bent
to
his
unprecedented
tirade
and
in
answer
she
mourned
oh
dearest
i
do
think
that
true
i
do
mean
to
make
you
old
i
know
perhaps
you
partly
right
perhaps
i
am
slow
about
getting
acquainted
with
new
people
but
when
you
think
of
all
the
dear
good
times
we
have
and
the
and
the
movies
and
all
with
true
masculine
wiles
he
not
only
convinced
himself
that
she
had
injured
him
but
by
the
loudness
of
his
voice
and
the
brutality
of
his
attack
he
convinced
her
also
and
presently
he
had
her
apologizing
for
his
having
spent
the
evening
with
tanis
he
went
up
to
bed
well
pleased
not
only
the
master
but
the
martyr
of
the
household
for
a
distasteful
moment
after
he
had
lain
down
he
wondered
if
he
had
been
altogether
just
ought
to
be
ashamed
bullying
her
maybe
there
is
her
side
to
things
maybe
she
has
had
such
a
bloomin
hectic
time
herself
but
i
do
care
good
for
her
to
get
waked
up
a
little
and
i
going
to
keep
free
of
her
and
tanis
and
the
fellows
at
the
club
and
everybody
going
to
run
my
own
life
ii
in
this
mood
he
was
particularly
objectionable
at
the
boosters
club
lunch
next
day
they
were
addressed
by
a
congressman
who
had
just
returned
from
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
finances
ethnology
political
systems
linguistic
divisions
mineral
resources
and
agriculture
of
germany
france
great
britain
italy
austria
czechoslovakia
jugoslavia
and
bulgaria
he
told
them
all
about
those
subjects
together
with
three
funny
stories
about
european
misconceptions
of
america
and
some
spirited
words
on
the
necessity
of
keeping
ignorant
foreigners
out
of
america
say
that
was
a
mighty
informative
talk
real
said
sidney
finkelstein
but
the
disaffected
babbitt
grumbled
bunch
of
hot
air
and
what
the
matter
with
the
immigrants
gosh
they
all
ignorant
and
i
got
a
hunch
we
all
descended
from
immigrants
oh
you
make
me
tired
said
finkelstein
babbitt
was
aware
that
dilling
was
sternly
listening
from
across
the
table
dilling
was
one
of
the
most
important
men
in
the
boosters
he
was
not
a
physician
but
a
surgeon
a
more
romantic
and
sounding
occupation
he
was
an
intense
large
man
with
a
boiling
of
black
hair
and
a
thick
black
mustache
the
newspapers
often
chronicled
his
operations
he
was
professor
of
surgery
in
the
state
university
he
went
to
dinner
at
the
very
best
houses
on
royal
ridge
and
he
was
said
to
be
worth
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
it
was
dismaying
to
babbitt
to
have
such
a
person
glower
at
him
he
hastily
praised
the
wit
to
sidney
finkelstein
but
for
dilling
benefit
iii
that
afternoon
three
men
shouldered
into
babbitt
office
with
the
air
of
a
vigilante
committee
in
frontier
days
they
were
large
resolute
men
and
they
were
all
high
lords
in
the
land
of
zenith
dilling
the
surgeon
charles
mckelvey
the
contractor
and
most
dismaying
of
all
the
colonel
rutherford
snow
owner
of
the
in
their
whelming
presence
babbitt
felt
small
and
insignificant
well
well
great
pleasure
have
chairs
what
i
do
for
you
he
babbled
they
neither
sat
nor
offered
observations
on
the
weather
babbitt
said
colonel
snow
we
come
from
the
good
league
we
decided
we
want
you
to
join
vergil
gunch
says
you
care
to
but
i
think
we
can
show
you
a
new
light
the
league
is
going
to
combine
with
the
chamber
of
commerce
in
a
campaign
for
the
open
shop
so
it
time
for
you
to
put
your
name
in
his
embarrassment
babbitt
could
not
recall
his
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
join
the
league
if
indeed
he
had
ever
definitely
known
them
but
he
was
passionately
certain
that
he
did
not
wish
to
join
and
at
the
thought
of
their
forcing
him
he
felt
a
stirring
of
anger
against
even
these
princes
of
commerce
sorry
colonel
have
to
think
it
over
a
little
he
mumbled
mckelvey
snarled
that
means
you
not
going
to
join
george
something
black
and
unfamiliar
and
ferocious
spoke
from
babbitt
now
you
look
here
charley
i
damned
if
i
going
to
be
bullied
into
joining
anything
not
even
by
you
plutes
we
not
bullying
anybody
dilling
began
but
colonel
snow
thrust
him
aside
with
certainly
we
are
we
do
mind
a
little
bullying
if
it
necessary
babbitt
the
has
been
talking
about
you
a
good
deal
you
supposed
to
be
a
sensible
clean
responsible
man
you
always
have
been
but
here
lately
for
god
knows
what
reason
i
hear
from
all
sorts
of
sources
that
you
running
around
with
a
loose
crowd
and
what
a
whole
lot
worse
you
actually
been
advocating
and
supporting
some
of
the
most
dangerous
elements
in
town
like
this
fellow
colonel
that
strikes
me
as
my
private
possibly
but
we
want
to
have
an
understanding
you
stood
in
you
and
your
with
some
of
the
most
substantial
and
interests
in
town
like
my
friends
of
the
street
traction
company
and
my
papers
have
given
you
a
lot
of
boosts
well
you
ca
expect
the
decent
citizens
to
go
on
aiding
you
if
you
intend
to
side
with
precisely
the
people
who
are
trying
to
undermine
babbitt
was
frightened
but
he
had
an
agonized
instinct
that
if
he
yielded
in
this
he
would
yield
in
everything
he
protested
you
exaggerating
colonel
i
believe
in
being
and
liberal
but
of
course
i
just
as
much
agin
the
cranks
and
blatherskites
and
labor
unions
and
so
on
as
you
are
but
fact
is
i
belong
to
so
many
organizations
now
that
i
ca
do
justice
and
i
want
to
think
it
over
before
i
decide
about
coming
into
the
colonel
snow
condescended
oh
no
i
not
exaggerating
why
the
doctor
here
heard
you
cussing
out
and
defaming
one
of
the
finest
types
of
republican
congressmen
just
this
noon
and
you
have
entirely
the
wrong
idea
about
over
joining
we
not
begging
you
to
join
the
we
permitting
you
to
join
i
not
sure
my
boy
but
what
if
you
put
it
off
it
be
too
late
i
not
sure
we
want
you
then
better
think
quick
better
think
quick
the
three
vigilantes
formidable
in
their
righteousness
stared
at
him
in
a
taut
silence
babbitt
waited
through
he
thought
nothing
at
all
he
merely
waited
while
in
his
echoing
head
buzzed
i
do
want
to
join
i
do
want
to
join
i
do
want
all
right
sorry
for
you
said
colonel
snow
and
the
three
men
abruptly
turned
their
beefy
backs
iv
as
babbitt
went
out
to
his
car
that
evening
he
saw
vergil
gunch
coming
down
the
block
he
raised
his
hand
in
salutation
but
gunch
ignored
it
and
crossed
the
street
he
was
certain
that
gunch
had
seen
him
he
drove
home
in
sharp
discomfort
his
wife
attacked
at
once
georgie
dear
muriel
frink
was
in
this
afternoon
and
she
says
that
chum
says
the
committee
of
this
good
citizens
league
especially
asked
you
to
join
and
you
would
you
think
it
would
be
better
you
know
all
the
nicest
people
belong
and
the
league
stands
for
i
know
what
the
league
stands
for
it
stands
for
the
suppression
of
free
speech
and
free
thought
and
everything
else
i
do
propose
to
be
bullied
and
rushed
into
joining
anything
and
it
is
a
question
of
whether
it
a
good
league
or
a
bad
league
or
what
the
hell
kind
of
a
league
it
is
it
just
a
question
of
my
refusing
to
be
told
i
got
to
but
dear
if
you
do
join
people
might
criticize
let
criticize
but
i
mean
nice
people
rats
i
matter
of
fact
this
whole
league
is
just
a
fad
it
like
all
these
other
organizations
that
start
off
with
such
a
rush
and
let
on
they
going
to
change
the
whole
works
and
pretty
soon
they
peter
out
and
everybody
forgets
all
about
but
if
it
the
fad
now
do
you
think
you
no
i
do
oh
myra
please
quit
nagging
me
about
it
i
sick
of
hearing
about
the
confounded
i
almost
wish
i
joined
it
when
verg
first
came
around
and
got
it
over
and
maybe
i
come
in
if
the
committee
had
tried
to
bullyrag
me
but
by
god
as
long
as
i
a
independent
american
cit
now
george
you
talking
exactly
like
the
german
oh
i
am
am
i
then
i
wo
talk
at
all
he
longed
that
evening
to
see
tanis
judique
to
be
strengthened
by
her
sympathy
when
all
the
family
were
he
got
as
far
as
telephoning
to
her
but
he
was
agitated
about
it
and
when
the
janitor
answered
he
blurted
nev
mind
i
call
later
and
hung
up
the
receiver
v
if
babbitt
had
not
been
certain
about
vergil
gunch
avoiding
him
there
could
be
little
doubt
about
william
washington
eathorne
next
morning
when
babbitt
was
driving
down
to
the
office
he
overtook
eathorne
car
with
the
great
banker
sitting
in
anemic
solemnity
behind
his
chauffeur
babbitt
waved
and
cried
mornin
eathorne
looked
at
him
deliberately
hesitated
and
gave
him
a
nod
more
contemptuous
than
a
direct
cut
babbitt
partner
and
came
in
at
ten
george
what
this
i
hear
about
some
song
and
dance
you
gave
colonel
snow
about
not
wanting
to
join
the
what
the
dickens
you
trying
to
do
wreck
the
firm
you
do
suppose
these
big
guns
will
stand
your
bucking
them
and
springing
all
this
poppycock
you
been
getting
off
lately
do
you
oh
rats
henry
you
been
reading
bum
fiction
there
ai
any
such
a
thing
as
these
plots
to
keep
folks
from
being
liberal
this
is
a
free
country
a
man
can
do
anything
he
wants
course
th
ai
any
plots
who
said
they
was
only
if
folks
get
an
idea
you
and
unstable
you
do
suppose
they
want
to
do
business
with
you
do
you
one
little
rumor
about
your
being
a
crank
would
do
more
to
ruin
this
business
than
all
the
plots
and
stuff
that
these
fool
could
think
up
in
a
month
of
that
afternoon
when
the
old
reliable
conrad
lyte
the
merry
miser
conrad
lyte
appeared
and
babbitt
suggested
his
buying
a
parcel
of
land
in
the
new
residential
section
of
dorchester
lyte
said
hastily
too
hastily
no
no
do
want
to
go
into
anything
new
just
a
week
later
babbitt
learned
through
henry
thompson
that
the
officials
of
the
street
traction
company
were
planning
another
coup
and
that
sanders
torrey
and
wing
not
the
company
were
to
handle
it
for
them
i
figure
that
jake
offutt
is
kind
of
leery
about
the
way
folks
are
talking
about
you
of
course
jake
is
a
old
and
he
probably
advised
the
traction
fellows
to
get
some
other
broker
george
you
got
to
do
something
trembled
thompson
and
in
a
rush
babbitt
agreed
all
nonsense
the
way
people
misjudged
him
but
still
he
determined
to
join
the
good
citizens
league
the
next
time
he
was
asked
and
in
furious
resignation
he
waited
he
asked
they
ignored
him
he
did
not
have
the
courage
to
go
to
the
league
and
beg
in
and
he
took
refuge
in
a
shaky
boast
that
he
had
gotten
away
with
bucking
the
whole
city
nobody
could
dictate
to
him
how
he
was
going
to
think
and
act
he
was
jarred
as
by
nothing
else
when
the
paragon
of
stenographers
miss
mcgoun
suddenly
left
him
though
her
reasons
were
excellent
she
needed
a
rest
her
sister
was
sick
she
might
not
do
any
more
work
for
six
months
he
was
uncomfortable
with
her
successor
miss
havstad
what
miss
havstad
given
name
was
no
one
in
the
office
ever
knew
it
seemed
improbable
that
she
had
a
given
name
a
lover
a
or
a
digestion
she
was
so
impersonal
this
slight
pale
industrious
swede
that
it
was
vulgar
to
think
of
her
as
going
to
an
ordinary
home
to
eat
hash
she
was
a
perfectly
oiled
and
enameled
machine
and
she
ought
each
evening
to
have
been
dusted
off
and
shut
in
her
desk
beside
her
pencil
points
she
took
dictation
swiftly
her
typing
was
perfect
but
babbitt
became
jumpy
when
he
tried
to
work
with
her
she
made
him
feel
puffy
and
at
his
daily
jokes
she
looked
gently
inquiring
he
longed
for
miss
mcgoun
return
and
thought
of
writing
to
her
then
he
heard
that
miss
mcgoun
had
a
week
after
leaving
him
gone
over
to
his
dangerous
competitors
sanders
torrey
and
wing
he
was
not
merely
annoyed
he
was
frightened
why
did
she
quit
then
he
worried
did
she
have
a
hunch
my
business
is
going
on
the
rocks
and
it
was
sanders
got
the
street
traction
deal
rats
sinking
ship
gray
fear
loomed
always
by
him
now
he
watched
fritz
weilinger
the
young
salesman
and
wondered
if
he
too
would
leave
daily
he
fancied
slights
he
noted
that
he
was
not
asked
to
speak
at
the
annual
chamber
of
commerce
dinner
when
orville
jones
gave
a
large
poker
party
and
he
was
not
invited
he
was
certain
that
he
had
been
snubbed
he
was
afraid
to
go
to
lunch
at
the
athletic
club
and
afraid
not
to
go
he
believed
that
he
was
spied
on
that
when
he
left
the
table
they
whispered
about
him
everywhere
he
heard
the
rustling
whispers
in
the
offices
of
clients
in
the
bank
when
he
made
a
deposit
in
his
own
office
in
his
own
home
interminably
he
wondered
what
they
were
saying
of
him
all
day
long
in
imaginary
conversations
he
caught
them
marveling
babbitt
why
say
he
a
regular
anarchist
you
got
to
admire
the
fellow
for
his
nerve
the
way
he
turned
liberal
and
by
golly
just
absolutely
runs
his
life
to
suit
himself
but
say
he
dangerous
that
what
he
is
and
he
got
to
be
shown
he
was
so
twitchy
that
when
he
rounded
a
corner
and
chanced
on
two
acquaintances
talking
whispering
his
heart
leaped
and
he
stalked
by
like
an
embarrassed
schoolboy
when
he
saw
his
neighbors
howard
littlefield
and
orville
jones
together
he
peered
at
them
went
indoors
to
escape
their
spying
and
was
miserably
certain
that
they
had
been
whispering
plotting
whispering
through
all
his
fear
ran
defiance
he
felt
stubborn
sometimes
he
decided
that
he
had
been
a
very
devil
of
a
fellow
as
bold
as
seneca
doane
sometimes
he
planned
to
call
on
doane
and
tell
him
what
a
revolutionist
he
was
and
never
got
beyond
the
planning
but
just
as
often
when
he
heard
the
soft
whispers
enveloping
him
he
wailed
good
lord
what
have
i
done
just
played
with
the
bunch
and
called
down
clarence
drum
about
being
such
a
sodger
never
catch
me
criticizing
people
and
trying
to
make
them
accept
my
ideas
he
could
not
stand
the
strain
before
long
he
admitted
that
he
would
like
to
flee
back
to
the
security
of
conformity
provided
there
was
a
decent
and
creditable
way
to
return
but
stubbornly
he
would
not
be
forced
back
he
would
not
he
swore
eat
only
in
spirited
engagements
with
his
wife
did
these
turbulent
fears
rise
to
the
surface
she
complained
that
he
seemed
nervous
that
she
could
understand
why
he
did
not
want
to
drop
in
at
the
littlefields
for
the
evening
he
tried
but
he
could
not
express
to
her
the
nebulous
facts
of
his
rebellion
and
punishment
and
with
paul
and
tanis
lost
he
had
no
one
to
whom
he
could
talk
good
lord
tinka
is
the
only
real
friend
i
have
these
days
he
sighed
and
he
clung
to
the
child
played
with
her
all
evening
he
considered
going
to
see
paul
in
prison
but
though
he
had
a
pale
curt
note
from
him
every
week
he
thought
of
paul
as
dead
it
was
tanis
for
whom
he
was
longing
i
thought
i
was
so
smart
and
independent
cutting
tanis
out
and
i
need
her
lord
how
i
need
her
he
raged
myra
simply
ca
understand
all
she
sees
in
life
is
getting
along
by
being
just
like
other
folks
but
tanis
she
tell
me
i
was
all
then
he
broke
and
one
evening
late
he
did
run
to
tanis
he
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
it
but
she
was
in
and
alone
only
she
was
tanis
she
was
a
courteous
woman
who
looked
like
tanis
she
said
yes
george
what
is
it
in
even
and
uninterested
tones
and
he
crept
away
whipped
his
first
comfort
was
from
ted
and
eunice
littlefield
they
danced
in
one
evening
when
ted
was
home
from
the
university
and
ted
chuckled
what
this
i
hear
from
euny
dad
she
says
her
dad
says
you
raised
cain
by
boosting
old
seneca
doane
hot
dog
give
fits
stir
up
this
old
burg
is
asleep
eunice
plumped
down
on
lap
kissed
him
nestled
her
bobbed
hair
against
his
chin
and
crowed
i
think
you
lots
nicer
than
howard
why
is
it
confidentially
that
howard
is
such
an
old
grouch
the
man
has
a
good
heart
and
honestly
he
awfully
bright
but
he
never
will
learn
to
step
on
the
gas
after
all
the
training
i
given
him
do
you
think
we
could
do
something
with
him
dearest
why
eunice
that
is
a
nice
way
to
speak
of
your
papa
babbitt
observed
in
the
best
floral
heights
manner
but
he
was
happy
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
he
pictured
himself
as
the
veteran
liberal
strengthened
by
the
loyalty
of
the
young
generation
they
went
out
to
rifle
the
babbitt
gloated
if
your
mother
caught
us
at
this
we
certainly
get
our
and
eunice
became
maternal
scrambled
a
terrifying
number
of
eggs
for
them
kissed
babbitt
on
the
ear
and
in
the
voice
of
a
brooding
abbess
marveled
it
beats
the
devil
why
feminists
like
me
still
go
on
nursing
these
men
thus
stimulated
babbitt
was
reckless
when
he
encountered
sheldon
smeeth
educational
director
of
the
and
of
the
chatham
road
church
with
one
of
his
damp
hands
smeeth
imprisoned
babbitt
thick
paw
while
he
chanted
brother
babbitt
we
have
seen
you
at
church
very
often
lately
i
know
you
busy
with
a
multitude
of
details
but
you
must
forget
your
dear
friends
at
the
old
church
babbitt
shook
off
the
affectionate
clasp
sheldy
liked
to
hold
hands
for
a
long
time
and
snarled
well
i
guess
you
fellows
can
run
the
show
without
me
sorry
smeeth
got
to
beat
it
but
afterward
he
winced
if
that
white
worm
had
the
nerve
to
try
to
drag
me
back
to
the
old
church
home
then
the
holy
outfit
must
have
been
doing
a
lot
of
talking
about
me
he
heard
them
whispering
whispering
john
jennison
drew
cholmondeley
frink
even
william
washington
eathorne
the
independence
seeped
out
of
him
and
he
walked
the
streets
alone
afraid
of
cynical
eyes
and
the
incessant
hiss
of
whispering
chapter
xxxiii
i
he
tried
to
explain
to
his
wife
as
they
prepared
for
bed
how
objectionable
was
sheldon
smeeth
but
all
her
answer
was
he
has
such
a
beautiful
voice
so
spiritual
i
do
think
you
ought
to
speak
of
him
like
that
just
because
you
ca
appreciate
music
he
saw
her
then
as
a
stranger
he
stared
bleakly
at
this
plump
and
fussy
woman
with
the
broad
bare
arms
and
wondered
how
she
had
ever
come
here
in
his
chilly
cot
turning
from
aching
side
to
side
he
pondered
of
tanis
he
been
a
fool
to
lose
her
he
had
to
have
somebody
he
could
really
talk
to
he
oh
he
bust
if
he
went
on
stewing
about
things
by
himself
and
myra
useless
to
expect
her
to
understand
well
rats
no
use
dodging
the
issue
darn
shame
for
two
married
people
to
drift
apart
after
all
these
years
darn
rotten
shame
but
nothing
could
bring
them
together
now
as
long
as
he
refused
to
let
zenith
bully
him
into
taking
orders
and
he
was
by
golly
not
going
to
let
anybody
bully
him
into
anything
or
wheedle
him
or
coax
him
either
he
woke
at
three
roused
by
a
passing
motor
and
struggled
out
of
bed
for
a
drink
of
water
as
he
passed
through
the
bedroom
he
heard
his
wife
groan
his
resentment
was
he
was
solicitous
in
inquiring
what
the
trouble
hon
i
got
such
a
pain
down
here
in
my
side
oh
it
just
it
tears
at
bad
indigestion
shall
i
get
you
some
bicarb
do
think
that
would
help
i
felt
funny
last
evening
and
yesterday
and
then
oh
it
passed
away
and
i
got
to
sleep
and
that
auto
woke
me
her
voice
was
laboring
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
he
was
alarmed
i
better
call
the
no
no
it
go
away
but
maybe
you
might
get
me
an
he
stalked
to
the
bathroom
for
the
down
to
the
kitchen
for
ice
he
felt
dramatic
in
this
expedition
but
as
he
gouged
the
chunk
of
ice
with
the
pick
he
was
cool
steady
mature
and
the
old
friendliness
was
in
his
voice
as
he
patted
the
into
place
on
her
groin
rumbling
there
there
that
be
better
he
retired
to
bed
but
he
did
not
sleep
he
heard
her
groan
again
instantly
he
was
up
soothing
her
still
pretty
bad
honey
yes
it
just
gripes
me
and
i
ca
get
to
her
voice
was
faint
he
knew
her
dread
of
doctors
verdicts
and
he
did
not
inform
her
but
he
creaked
telephoned
to
earl
patten
and
waited
shivering
trying
with
fuzzy
eyes
to
read
a
magazine
till
he
heard
the
doctor
car
the
doctor
was
youngish
and
professionally
breezy
he
came
in
as
though
it
were
sunny
noontime
well
george
little
trouble
eh
how
is
she
now
he
said
busily
as
with
tremendous
and
rather
irritating
cheerfulness
he
tossed
his
coat
on
a
chair
and
warmed
his
hands
at
a
radiator
he
took
charge
of
the
house
babbitt
felt
ousted
and
unimportant
as
he
followed
the
doctor
up
to
the
bedroom
and
it
was
the
doctor
who
chuckled
oh
just
little
when
verona
peeped
through
her
door
begging
what
is
it
dad
what
is
it
to
babbitt
the
doctor
said
with
amiable
belligerence
after
his
examination
kind
of
a
bad
old
pain
eh
i
give
you
something
to
make
you
sleep
and
i
think
you
feel
better
in
the
morning
i
come
in
right
after
but
to
babbitt
lying
in
wait
in
the
lower
hall
the
doctor
sighed
i
do
like
the
feeling
there
in
her
belly
there
some
rigidity
and
some
inflammation
she
never
had
her
appendix
out
has
she
um
well
no
use
worrying
i
be
here
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
meantime
she
get
some
rest
i
given
her
a
hypo
good
then
was
babbitt
caught
up
in
the
black
tempest
instantly
all
the
indignations
which
had
been
dominating
him
and
the
spiritual
dramas
through
which
he
had
struggled
became
pallid
and
absurd
before
the
ancient
and
overwhelming
realities
the
standard
and
traditional
realities
of
sickness
and
menacing
death
the
long
night
and
the
thousand
steadfast
implications
of
married
life
he
crept
back
to
her
as
she
drowsed
away
in
the
tropic
languor
of
morphia
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
holding
her
hand
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
her
hand
abode
trustfully
in
his
he
draped
himself
grotesquely
in
his
toweling
bathrobe
and
a
pink
and
white
and
sat
lumpishly
in
a
the
bedroom
was
uncanny
in
its
which
turned
the
curtains
to
lurking
robbers
the
to
a
turreted
castle
it
smelled
of
cosmetics
of
linen
of
sleep
he
napped
and
woke
napped
and
woke
a
hundred
times
he
heard
her
move
and
sigh
in
slumber
he
wondered
if
there
was
some
officious
brisk
thing
he
could
do
for
her
and
before
he
could
quite
form
the
thought
he
was
asleep
racked
and
aching
the
night
was
infinite
when
dawn
came
and
the
waiting
seemed
at
an
end
he
fell
asleep
and
was
vexed
to
have
been
caught
off
his
guard
to
have
been
aroused
by
verona
entrance
and
her
agitated
oh
what
is
it
dad
his
wife
was
awake
her
face
sallow
and
lifeless
in
the
morning
light
but
now
he
did
not
compare
her
with
tanis
she
was
not
merely
a
woman
to
be
contrasted
with
other
women
but
his
own
self
and
though
he
might
criticize
her
and
nag
her
it
was
only
as
he
might
criticize
and
nag
himself
interestedly
unpatronizingly
without
the
expectation
of
changing
or
any
real
desire
to
change
the
eternal
essence
with
verona
he
sounded
fatherly
again
and
firm
he
consoled
tinka
who
satisfactorily
pointed
the
excitement
of
the
hour
by
wailing
he
ordered
early
breakfast
and
wanted
to
look
at
the
newspaper
and
felt
somehow
heroic
and
useful
in
not
looking
at
it
but
there
were
still
crawling
and
totally
unheroic
hours
of
waiting
before
patten
returned
do
see
much
change
said
patten
i
be
back
about
eleven
and
if
you
do
mind
i
think
i
bring
in
some
other
for
consultation
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
now
george
there
nothing
you
can
do
i
have
verona
keep
the
filled
might
as
well
leave
that
on
i
guess
and
you
you
better
beat
it
to
the
office
instead
of
standing
around
her
looking
as
if
you
were
the
patient
the
nerve
of
husbands
lot
more
neurotic
than
the
women
they
always
have
to
horn
in
and
get
all
the
credit
for
feeling
bad
when
their
wives
are
ailing
now
have
another
nice
cup
of
coffee
and
git
under
this
derision
babbitt
became
more
he
drove
to
the
office
tried
to
dictate
letters
tried
to
telephone
and
before
the
call
was
answered
forgot
to
whom
he
was
telephoning
at
a
quarter
after
ten
he
returned
home
as
he
left
the
traffic
and
sped
up
the
car
his
face
was
as
grimly
creased
as
the
mask
of
tragedy
his
wife
greeted
him
with
surprise
why
did
you
come
back
dear
i
think
i
feel
a
little
better
i
told
verona
to
skip
off
to
her
office
was
it
wicked
of
me
to
go
and
get
sick
he
knew
that
she
wanted
petting
and
she
got
it
joyously
they
were
curiously
happy
when
he
heard
patten
car
in
front
he
looked
out
of
the
window
he
was
frightened
with
patten
was
an
impatient
man
with
turbulent
black
hair
and
a
hussar
mustache
dilling
the
surgeon
babbitt
sputtered
with
anxiety
tried
to
conceal
it
and
hurried
down
to
the
door
patten
was
profusely
casual
do
want
to
worry
you
old
man
but
i
thought
it
might
be
a
good
stunt
to
have
dilling
examine
he
gestured
toward
dilling
as
toward
a
master
dilling
nodded
in
his
curtest
manner
and
strode
babbitt
tramped
the
in
agony
except
for
his
wife
confinements
there
had
never
been
a
major
operation
in
the
family
and
to
him
surgery
was
at
once
a
miracle
and
an
abomination
of
fear
but
when
dilling
and
patten
came
down
again
he
knew
that
everything
was
all
right
and
he
wanted
to
laugh
for
the
two
doctors
were
exactly
like
the
bearded
physicians
in
a
musical
comedy
both
of
them
rubbing
their
hands
and
looking
foolishly
sagacious
dilling
spoke
i
sorry
old
man
but
it
acute
appendicitis
we
ought
to
operate
of
course
you
must
decide
but
there
no
question
as
to
what
has
to
be
babbitt
did
not
get
all
the
force
of
it
he
mumbled
well
i
suppose
we
could
get
her
ready
in
a
couple
o
days
probably
ted
ought
to
come
down
from
the
university
just
in
case
anything
dilling
growled
nope
if
you
do
want
peritonitis
to
set
in
we
have
to
operate
right
away
i
must
advise
it
strongly
if
you
say
go
ahead
i
for
the
mary
ambulance
at
once
and
have
her
on
the
table
in
of
an
i
i
of
course
i
suppose
you
know
what
but
great
god
man
i
get
her
clothes
ready
and
everything
in
two
seconds
you
know
and
in
her
state
so
and
weak
just
throw
her
and
comb
and
in
a
bag
all
she
need
for
a
day
or
two
said
dilling
and
went
to
the
telephone
babbitt
galloped
desperately
he
sent
the
frightened
tinka
out
of
the
room
he
said
gaily
to
his
wife
well
old
thing
the
doc
thinks
maybe
we
better
have
a
little
operation
and
get
it
over
just
take
a
few
minutes
not
half
as
serious
as
a
confinement
and
you
be
all
right
in
a
she
gripped
his
hand
till
the
fingers
ached
she
said
patiently
like
a
cowed
child
i
afraid
to
go
into
the
dark
all
alone
maturity
was
wiped
from
her
eyes
they
were
pleading
and
terrified
will
you
stay
with
me
darling
you
do
have
to
go
to
the
office
now
do
you
could
you
just
go
down
to
the
hospital
with
me
could
you
come
see
me
this
evening
if
everything
all
right
you
wo
have
to
go
out
this
evening
will
you
he
was
on
his
knees
by
the
bed
while
she
feebly
ruffled
his
hair
he
sobbed
he
kissed
the
lawn
of
her
sleeve
and
swore
old
honey
i
love
you
more
than
anything
in
the
world
i
kind
of
been
worried
by
business
and
everything
but
that
all
over
now
and
i
back
are
you
really
george
i
was
thinking
lying
here
maybe
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
i
just
went
i
was
wondering
if
anybody
really
needed
me
or
wanted
me
i
was
wondering
what
was
the
use
of
my
living
i
been
getting
so
stupid
and
ugly
why
you
old
humbug
fishing
for
compliments
when
i
ought
to
be
packing
your
bag
me
sure
i
young
and
handsome
and
a
regular
village
and
he
could
not
go
on
he
sobbed
again
and
in
muttered
incoherencies
they
found
each
other
as
he
packed
his
brain
was
curiously
clear
and
swift
he
have
no
more
wild
evenings
he
realized
he
admitted
that
he
would
regret
them
a
little
grimly
he
perceived
that
this
had
been
his
last
despairing
fling
before
the
paralyzed
contentment
of
well
and
he
grinned
impishly
it
was
one
doggone
good
party
while
it
lasted
and
how
much
was
the
operation
going
to
cost
i
ought
to
have
fought
that
out
with
dilling
but
no
damn
it
i
do
care
how
much
it
costs
the
motor
ambulance
was
at
the
door
even
in
his
grief
the
babbitt
who
admired
all
technical
excellences
was
interested
in
the
kindly
skill
with
which
the
attendants
slid
babbitt
upon
a
stretcher
and
carried
her
the
ambulance
was
a
huge
suave
varnished
white
thing
babbitt
moaned
it
frightens
me
it
just
like
a
hearse
just
like
being
put
in
a
hearse
i
want
you
to
stay
with
i
be
right
up
front
with
the
driver
babbitt
promised
no
i
want
you
to
stay
inside
with
to
the
attendants
ca
he
be
inside
sure
you
bet
there
a
fine
little
in
there
the
older
attendant
said
with
professional
pride
he
sat
beside
her
in
that
traveling
cabin
with
its
cot
its
stool
its
active
little
electric
radiator
and
its
quite
unexplained
calendar
displaying
a
girl
eating
cherries
and
the
name
of
an
enterprising
grocer
but
as
he
flung
out
his
hand
in
hopeless
cheerfulness
it
touched
the
radiator
and
he
squealed
ouch
jesus
why
george
babbitt
i
wo
have
you
cursing
and
swearing
and
blaspheming
i
know
awful
sorry
but
gosh
all
look
how
i
burned
my
hand
gee
whiz
it
hurts
it
hurts
like
the
mischief
why
that
damn
radiator
is
hot
as
it
hot
as
it
hotter
the
hinges
of
hades
look
you
can
see
the
mark
so
as
they
drove
up
to
mary
hospital
with
the
nurses
already
laying
out
the
instruments
for
an
operation
to
save
her
life
it
was
she
who
consoled
him
and
kissed
the
place
to
make
it
well
and
though
he
tried
to
be
gruff
and
mature
he
yielded
to
her
and
was
glad
to
be
babied
the
ambulance
whirled
under
the
hooded
of
the
hospital
and
instantly
he
was
reduced
to
a
zero
in
the
nightmare
succession
of
halls
endless
doors
open
on
old
women
sitting
up
in
bed
an
elevator
the
anesthetizing
room
a
young
interne
contemptuous
of
husbands
he
was
permitted
to
kiss
his
wife
he
saw
a
thin
dark
nurse
fit
the
cone
over
her
mouth
and
nose
he
stiffened
at
a
sweet
and
treacherous
odor
then
he
was
driven
out
and
on
a
high
stool
in
a
laboratory
he
sat
dazed
longing
to
see
her
once
again
to
insist
that
he
had
always
loved
her
had
never
for
a
second
loved
anybody
else
or
looked
at
anybody
else
in
the
laboratory
he
was
conscious
only
of
a
decayed
object
preserved
in
a
bottle
of
yellowing
alcohol
it
made
him
very
sick
but
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
he
was
more
aware
of
it
than
of
waiting
his
mind
floated
in
abeyance
coming
back
always
to
that
horrible
bottle
to
escape
it
he
opened
the
door
to
the
right
hoping
to
find
a
sane
and
office
he
realized
that
he
was
looking
into
the
in
one
glance
he
took
in
dilling
strange
in
white
gown
and
bandaged
head
bending
over
the
steel
table
with
its
screws
and
wheels
then
nurses
holding
basins
and
cotton
sponges
and
a
swathed
thing
just
a
lifeless
chin
and
a
mound
of
white
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
square
of
sallow
flesh
with
a
gash
a
little
bloody
at
the
edges
protruding
from
the
gash
a
cluster
of
forceps
like
clinging
parasites
he
shut
the
door
with
haste
it
may
be
that
his
frightened
repentance
of
the
night
and
morning
had
not
eaten
in
but
this
dehumanizing
interment
of
her
who
had
been
so
pathetically
human
shook
him
utterly
and
as
he
crouched
again
on
the
high
stool
in
the
laboratory
he
swore
faith
to
his
wife
to
zenith
to
business
efficiency
to
the
club
to
every
faith
of
the
clan
of
good
fellows
then
a
nurse
was
soothing
all
over
perfect
success
she
come
out
fine
she
be
out
from
under
the
anesthetic
soon
and
you
can
see
he
found
her
on
a
curious
tilted
bed
her
face
an
unwholesome
yellow
but
her
purple
lips
moving
slightly
then
only
did
he
really
believe
that
she
was
alive
she
was
muttering
he
bent
and
heard
her
sighing
hard
get
real
maple
syrup
for
he
laughed
inexhaustibly
he
beamed
on
the
nurse
and
proudly
confided
think
of
her
talking
about
maple
syrup
by
golly
i
going
to
go
and
order
a
hundred
gallons
of
it
right
from
vermont
ii
she
was
out
of
the
hospital
in
seventeen
days
he
went
to
see
her
each
afternoon
and
in
their
long
talks
they
drifted
back
to
intimacy
once
he
hinted
something
of
his
relations
to
tanis
and
the
bunch
and
she
was
inflated
by
the
view
that
a
wicked
woman
had
captivated
her
poor
george
if
once
he
had
doubted
his
neighbors
and
the
supreme
charm
of
the
good
fellows
he
was
convinced
now
you
did
he
noted
see
seneca
doane
coming
around
with
any
flowers
or
dropping
in
to
chat
with
the
missus
but
howard
littlefield
brought
to
the
hospital
her
priceless
wine
jelly
flavored
with
real
wine
orville
jones
spent
hours
in
picking
out
the
kind
of
novels
babbitt
liked
nice
love
stories
about
new
york
millionaries
and
wyoming
cowpunchers
louetta
swanson
knitted
a
pink
sidney
finkelstein
and
his
merry
flapper
of
a
wife
selected
the
prettiest
nightgown
in
all
the
stock
of
parcher
and
stein
all
his
friends
ceased
whispering
about
him
suspecting
him
at
the
athletic
club
they
asked
after
her
daily
club
members
whose
names
he
did
not
know
stopped
him
to
inquire
how
your
good
lady
getting
on
babbitt
felt
that
he
was
swinging
from
bleak
uplands
down
into
the
rich
warm
air
of
a
valley
pleasant
with
cottages
one
noon
vergil
gunch
suggested
you
planning
to
be
at
the
hospital
about
six
the
wife
and
i
thought
we
drop
they
did
drop
in
gunch
was
so
humorous
that
babbitt
said
he
must
stop
making
her
laugh
because
honestly
it
was
hurting
her
as
they
passed
down
the
hall
gunch
demanded
amiably
george
old
scout
you
were
soreheaded
about
something
here
a
while
back
i
do
know
why
and
it
none
of
my
business
but
you
seem
to
be
feeling
all
again
and
why
do
you
come
join
us
in
the
good
citizens
league
old
man
we
have
some
corking
times
together
and
we
need
your
then
did
babbitt
almost
tearful
with
joy
at
being
coaxed
instead
of
bullied
at
being
permitted
to
stop
fighting
at
being
able
to
desert
without
injuring
his
opinion
of
himself
cease
utterly
to
be
a
domestic
revolutionist
he
patted
gunch
shoulder
and
next
day
he
became
a
member
of
the
good
citizens
league
within
two
weeks
no
one
in
the
league
was
more
violent
regarding
the
wickedness
of
seneca
doane
the
crimes
of
labor
unions
the
perils
of
immigration
and
the
delights
of
golf
morality
and
than
was
george
babbitt
chapter
xxxiv
i
the
good
citizens
league
had
spread
through
the
country
but
nowhere
was
it
so
effective
and
well
esteemed
as
in
cities
of
the
type
of
zenith
commercial
cities
of
a
few
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
most
of
which
though
not
all
lay
inland
against
a
background
of
cornfields
and
mines
and
of
small
towns
which
depended
upon
them
for
art
social
philosophy
and
millinery
to
the
league
belonged
most
of
the
prosperous
citizens
of
zenith
they
were
not
all
of
the
kind
who
called
themselves
regular
besides
these
hearty
fellows
these
salesmen
of
prosperity
there
were
the
aristocrats
that
is
the
men
who
were
richer
or
had
been
rich
for
more
generations
the
presidents
of
banks
and
of
factories
the
the
corporation
lawyers
the
fashionable
doctors
and
the
few
men
who
worked
not
at
all
but
reluctantly
remaining
in
zenith
collected
and
first
editions
as
though
they
were
back
in
paris
all
of
them
agreed
that
the
must
be
kept
in
their
place
and
all
of
them
perceived
that
american
democracy
did
not
imply
any
equality
of
wealth
but
did
demand
a
wholesome
sameness
of
thought
dress
painting
morals
and
vocabulary
in
this
they
were
like
the
of
any
other
country
particularly
of
great
britain
but
they
differed
in
being
more
vigorous
and
in
actually
trying
to
produce
the
accepted
standards
which
all
classes
everywhere
desire
but
usually
despair
of
realizing
the
longest
struggle
of
the
good
citizens
league
was
against
the
open
shop
which
was
secretly
a
struggle
against
all
union
labor
accompanying
it
was
an
americanization
movement
with
evening
classes
in
english
and
history
and
economics
and
daily
articles
in
the
newspapers
so
that
newly
arrived
foreigners
might
learn
that
the
and
one
hundred
per
cent
american
way
of
settling
was
for
workmen
to
trust
and
love
their
employers
the
league
was
more
than
generous
in
approving
other
organizations
which
agreed
with
its
aims
it
helped
the
to
raise
a
fund
for
a
new
building
babbitt
vergil
gunch
sidney
finkelstein
and
even
charles
mckelvey
told
the
spectators
at
movie
theaters
how
great
an
influence
for
manly
christianity
the
good
old
had
been
in
their
own
lives
and
the
hoar
and
mighty
colonel
rutherford
snow
owner
of
the
was
photographed
clasping
the
hand
of
sheldon
smeeth
of
the
it
is
true
that
afterward
when
smeeth
lisped
you
must
come
to
one
of
our
the
ferocious
colonel
bellowed
what
the
hell
would
i
do
that
for
i
got
a
bar
of
my
own
but
this
did
not
appear
in
the
public
prints
the
league
was
of
value
to
the
american
legion
at
a
time
when
certain
of
the
lesser
and
looser
newspapers
were
criticizing
that
organization
of
veterans
of
the
great
war
one
evening
a
number
of
young
men
raided
the
zenith
socialist
headquarters
burned
its
records
beat
the
office
staff
and
agreeably
dumped
desks
out
of
the
window
all
of
the
newspapers
save
the
and
the
evening
advocate
attributed
this
valuable
but
perhaps
hasty
to
the
american
legion
then
a
flying
squadron
from
the
good
citizens
league
called
on
the
unfair
papers
and
explained
that
no
could
possibly
do
such
a
thing
and
the
editors
saw
the
light
and
retained
their
advertising
when
zenith
lone
conscientious
objector
came
home
from
prison
and
was
righteously
run
out
of
town
the
newspapers
referred
to
the
perpetrators
as
an
unidentified
ii
in
all
the
activities
and
triumphs
of
the
good
citizens
league
babbitt
took
part
and
completely
won
back
to
placidity
and
the
affection
of
his
friends
but
he
began
to
protest
gosh
i
done
my
share
in
cleaning
up
the
city
i
want
to
tend
to
business
think
just
kind
of
slacken
up
on
this
stuff
he
had
returned
to
the
church
as
he
had
returned
to
the
boosters
club
he
had
even
endured
the
lavish
greeting
which
sheldon
smeeth
gave
him
he
was
worried
lest
during
his
late
discontent
he
had
imperiled
his
salvation
he
was
not
quite
sure
there
was
a
heaven
to
be
attained
but
john
jennison
drew
said
there
was
and
babbitt
was
not
going
to
take
a
chance
one
evening
when
he
was
walking
past
drew
parsonage
he
impulsively
went
in
and
found
the
pastor
in
his
study
jus
minute
getting
call
said
drew
in
businesslike
tones
then
aggressively
to
the
telephone
this
berkey
and
hannis
reverend
drew
speaking
where
the
dickens
is
the
proof
for
next
calendar
huh
y
ought
to
have
it
here
well
i
ca
help
it
if
they
all
sick
i
got
to
have
it
get
an
boy
and
shoot
it
up
here
he
turned
without
slackening
his
briskness
well
brother
babbitt
what
i
do
for
you
i
just
wanted
to
ask
tell
you
how
it
is
dominie
here
a
while
ago
i
guess
i
got
kind
of
slack
took
a
few
drinks
and
so
on
what
i
wanted
to
ask
is
how
is
it
if
a
fellow
cuts
that
all
out
and
comes
back
to
his
senses
does
it
sort
of
well
you
might
say
does
it
score
against
him
in
the
long
run
the
reverend
drew
was
suddenly
interested
and
uh
brother
the
other
things
too
women
no
practically
you
might
say
practically
not
at
do
hesitate
to
tell
me
brother
that
what
i
here
for
been
going
on
squeezing
girls
in
cars
the
reverend
eyes
glistened
no
no
well
i
tell
you
i
got
a
deputation
from
the
do
make
prohibition
a
joke
association
coming
to
see
me
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
one
from
the
union
at
a
quarter
of
he
busily
glanced
at
his
watch
but
i
can
take
five
minutes
off
and
pray
with
you
kneel
right
down
by
your
chair
brother
do
be
ashamed
to
seek
the
guidance
of
babbitt
scalp
itched
and
he
longed
to
flee
but
drew
had
already
flopped
down
beside
his
and
his
voice
had
changed
from
rasping
efficiency
to
an
unctuous
familiarity
with
sin
and
with
the
almighty
babbitt
also
knelt
while
drew
gloated
o
lord
thou
seest
our
brother
here
who
has
been
led
astray
by
manifold
temptations
o
heavenly
father
make
his
heart
to
be
pure
as
pure
as
a
little
child
oh
let
him
know
again
the
joy
of
a
manly
courage
to
abstain
from
evil
sheldon
smeeth
came
frolicking
into
the
study
at
the
sight
of
the
two
men
he
smirked
forgivingly
patted
babbitt
on
the
shoulder
and
knelt
beside
him
his
arm
about
him
while
he
authorized
imprecations
with
moans
of
yes
lord
help
our
brother
lord
though
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
eyes
closed
babbitt
squinted
between
his
fingers
and
saw
the
pastor
glance
at
his
watch
as
he
concluded
with
a
triumphant
and
let
him
never
be
afraid
to
come
to
us
for
counsel
and
tender
care
and
let
him
know
that
the
church
can
lead
him
as
a
little
drew
sprang
up
rolled
his
eyes
in
the
general
direction
of
heaven
chucked
his
watch
into
his
pocket
and
demanded
has
the
deputation
come
yet
sheldy
yep
right
outside
sheldy
answered
with
equal
liveliness
then
caressingly
to
babbitt
brother
if
it
would
help
i
love
to
go
into
the
next
room
and
pray
with
you
while
drew
is
receiving
the
brothers
from
the
do
make
prohibition
a
joke
no
no
thanks
ca
take
the
time
yelped
babbitt
rushing
toward
the
door
thereafter
he
was
often
seen
at
the
chatham
road
presbyterian
church
but
it
is
recorded
that
he
avoided
shaking
hands
with
the
pastor
at
the
door
iii
if
his
moral
fiber
had
been
so
weakened
by
rebellion
that
he
was
not
quite
dependable
in
the
more
rigorous
campaigns
of
the
good
league
nor
quite
appreciative
of
the
church
yet
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
joy
with
which
babbitt
returned
to
the
pleasures
of
his
home
and
of
the
athletic
club
the
boosters
the
elks
verona
and
kenneth
escott
were
eventually
and
hesitatingly
married
for
the
wedding
babbitt
was
dressed
as
carefully
as
was
verona
he
was
crammed
into
the
he
wore
to
teas
thrice
a
year
and
with
a
certain
relief
after
verona
and
kenneth
had
driven
away
in
a
limousine
he
returned
to
the
house
removed
the
morning
coat
sat
with
his
aching
feet
up
on
the
davenport
and
reflected
that
his
wife
and
he
could
have
the
to
themselves
now
and
not
have
to
listen
to
verona
and
kenneth
worrying
in
a
cultured
collegiate
manner
about
minimum
wages
and
the
drama
league
but
even
this
sinking
into
peace
was
less
consoling
than
his
return
to
being
one
of
the
men
in
the
boosters
club
iv
president
willis
ijams
began
that
boosters
club
luncheon
by
standing
quiet
and
staring
at
them
so
unhappily
that
they
feared
he
was
about
to
announce
the
death
of
a
brother
booster
he
spoke
slowly
then
and
gravely
boys
i
have
something
shocking
to
reveal
to
you
something
terrible
about
one
of
our
own
several
boosters
including
babbitt
looked
disconcerted
a
knight
of
the
grip
a
trusted
friend
of
mine
recently
made
a
trip
and
in
a
certain
town
where
a
certain
booster
spent
his
boyhood
he
found
out
something
which
can
no
longer
be
concealed
in
fact
he
discovered
the
inward
nature
of
a
man
whom
we
have
accepted
as
a
real
guy
and
as
one
of
us
gentlemen
i
can
not
trust
my
voice
to
say
it
so
i
have
written
it
he
uncovered
a
large
blackboard
and
on
it
in
huge
capitals
was
the
legend
george
follansbee
babbitt
oh
you
folly
the
boosters
cheered
they
laughed
they
wept
they
threw
rolls
at
babbitt
they
cried
speech
speech
oh
you
folly
president
ijams
continued
that
gentlemen
is
the
awful
thing
georgie
babbitt
has
been
concealing
all
these
years
when
we
thought
he
was
just
plain
george
now
i
want
you
to
tell
us
taking
it
in
turn
what
you
always
supposed
the
stood
flivver
they
suggested
and
and
flathead
and
farinaceous
and
freezone
and
flapdoodle
and
foghorn
by
the
joviality
of
their
insults
babbitt
knew
that
he
had
been
taken
back
to
their
hearts
and
happily
he
rose
boys
i
got
to
admit
it
i
never
worn
a
or
parted
my
name
in
the
middle
but
i
will
confess
to
my
only
justification
is
that
my
old
dad
though
otherwise
he
was
perfectly
sane
and
packed
an
awful
wallop
when
it
came
to
trimming
the
city
fellers
at
checkers
named
me
after
the
family
doc
old
ambrose
follansbee
i
apologize
boys
in
my
next
i
see
to
it
that
i
get
named
something
really
practical
something
that
sounds
swell
and
yet
is
good
and
virile
something
in
fact
like
that
grand
old
name
so
familiar
to
every
household
that
bold
and
almost
overpowering
name
willis
jimjams
ijams
he
knew
by
the
cheer
that
he
was
secure
again
and
popular
he
knew
that
he
would
no
more
endanger
his
security
and
popularity
by
straying
from
the
clan
of
good
fellows
v
henry
thompson
dashed
into
the
office
clamoring
george
big
news
jake
offutt
says
the
traction
bunch
are
dissatisfied
with
the
way
sanders
torrey
and
wing
handled
their
last
deal
and
they
willing
to
dicker
with
us
babbitt
was
pleased
in
the
realization
that
the
last
scar
of
his
rebellion
was
healed
yet
as
he
drove
home
he
was
annoyed
by
such
background
thoughts
as
had
never
weakened
him
in
his
days
of
belligerent
conformity
he
discovered
that
he
actually
did
not
consider
the
traction
group
quite
honest
well
he
carry
out
one
more
deal
for
them
but
as
soon
as
it
was
practicable
maybe
as
soon
as
old
henry
thompson
died
he
break
away
from
all
association
from
them
he
was
in
twelve
years
he
be
sixty
he
wanted
to
leave
a
clean
business
to
his
grandchildren
course
there
was
a
lot
of
money
in
negotiating
for
the
traction
people
and
a
fellow
had
to
look
at
things
in
a
practical
way
only
he
wriggled
uncomfortably
he
wanted
to
tell
the
traction
group
what
he
thought
of
them
oh
he
could
do
it
not
now
if
he
offended
them
this
second
time
they
would
crush
him
but
he
was
conscious
that
his
line
of
progress
seemed
confused
he
wondered
what
he
would
do
with
his
future
he
was
still
young
was
he
through
with
all
adventuring
he
felt
that
he
had
been
trapped
into
the
very
net
from
which
he
had
with
such
fury
escaped
and
supremest
jest
of
all
been
made
to
rejoice
in
the
trapping
they
licked
me
licked
me
to
a
finish
he
whimpered
the
house
was
peaceful
that
evening
and
he
enjoyed
a
game
of
pinochle
with
his
wife
he
indignantly
told
the
tempter
that
he
was
content
to
do
things
in
the
good
old
fashioned
way
the
day
after
he
went
to
see
the
of
the
street
traction
company
and
they
made
plans
for
the
secret
purchase
of
lots
along
the
evanston
road
but
as
he
drove
to
his
office
he
struggled
i
going
to
run
things
and
figure
out
things
to
suit
myself
when
i
vi
ted
had
come
down
from
the
university
for
the
though
he
no
longer
spoke
of
mechanical
engineering
and
though
he
was
reticent
about
his
opinion
of
his
instructors
he
seemed
no
more
reconciled
to
college
and
his
chief
interest
was
his
wireless
telephone
set
on
saturday
evening
he
took
eunice
littlefield
to
a
dance
at
devon
woods
babbitt
had
a
glimpse
of
her
bouncing
in
the
seat
of
the
car
brilliant
in
a
scarlet
cloak
over
a
frock
of
thinnest
creamy
silk
they
two
had
not
returned
when
the
babbitts
went
to
bed
at
eleven
at
a
blurred
indefinite
time
of
late
night
babbitt
was
awakened
by
the
ring
of
the
telephone
and
gloomily
crawled
howard
littlefield
was
speaking
george
euny
is
back
yet
is
ted
no
at
least
his
door
is
open
they
ought
to
be
home
eunice
said
the
dance
would
be
over
at
midnight
what
the
name
of
those
people
where
they
going
why
gosh

the
truth

do
know
howard

classmate
of

devon
woods

what
we
can
do
wait
i
skip
up
and
ask
myra
if
she
knows
their
babbitt
turned
on
the
light
in
ted
room
it
was
a
brown
boyish
room
disordered
dresser
worn
books
a
pennant
photographs
of
teams
and
baseball
teams
ted
was
decidedly
not
there
babbitt
awakened
irritably
observed
that
she
certainly
did
not
know
the
name
of
ted
host
that
it
was
late
that
howard
littlefield
was
but
little
better
than
a
born
fool
and
that
she
was
sleepy
but
she
remained
awake
and
worrying
while
babbitt
on
the
struggled
back
into
sleep
through
the
incessant
soft
rain
of
her
remarks
it
was
after
dawn
when
he
was
aroused
by
her
shaking
him
and
calling
george
george
in
something
like
horror
wha
wha
what
is
it
come
here
quick
and
see
be
quiet
she
led
him
down
the
hall
to
the
door
of
ted
room
and
pushed
it
gently
open
on
the
worn
brown
rug
he
saw
a
froth
of
chiffon
lingerie
on
the
sedate
morris
chair
a
girl
silver
slipper
and
on
the
pillows
were
two
sleepy
heads
ted
and
eunice
ted
woke
to
grin
and
to
mutter
with
unconvincing
defiance
good
morning

me
introduce
my
wife
theodore
roosevelt
eunice
littlefield
babbitt
good
god
from
babbitt
and
from

pretty
good

shoulders
and
her
charming
wild
hair
under

by
nine
the
assembly
which
was
gathered
about
ted
and
eunice

and
kenneth
escott
and
henry
thompson
and
tinka
babbitt
who
was
the
only
pleased
member
of
the
inquisition
a
crackling
shower
of
phrases
filled
the
room
at
their
age
ought
to
be
annulled
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
fault
of
both
of
them
and
keep
it
out
of
the
papers

to
be
packed
off
to
school

something
about
it
at
once
and
what
i
say
is
damn
good
spanking
worst
of
them
all
was
verona
ted
some
way
must
be
found
to
make
you
understand
how
dreadfully
serious
this
is
instead
of
standing
around
with
that
silly
foolish
smile
on
your
face
he
began
to
revolt
gee
whittakers
rone

getting
sick
and
tired
of
being
the
corpse
in
this
post
mortem
if
you
want
to
kill
somebody
go
kill
the
preacher
that
married
us
why
he
stung
me
five
dollars
and
all
the
money
i
had
in
the
world
was
six
dollars
and
two
bits
i
getting
just
about
enough
of
being
hollered
at
a
new
voice
booming
authoritative
dominated
the
room
it
was
babbitt
yuh
there
too
darn
many
putting
in
their
oar
rone
you
dry
up
howard
and
i
are
still
pretty
strong
and
able
to
do
our
own
cussing
ted
come
into
the
and
we
talk
this
in
the
the
door
firmly
closed
babbitt
walked
to
his
son
put
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
you
more
or
less

too
much
now
what

you
plan
to
do
old
man
gosh

you
really
going
to
be
human
well
i
remember
one
time
you
called
us
babbitt
men
and
said
we
ought
to
stick
together
i
want
to
i
do
pretend
to
think
this
serious
the
way
the
cards
are
stacked
against
a
young
fellow
i
ca
say
i
approve
of
early
marriages
but
you
could
have
married
a
better
girl
than
eunice
and
way
i
figure
it
littlefield
is
darn
lucky
to
get
a
babbitt
for
a
but
what
do
you
plan
to
do
course
you
could
go
right
ahead
with
the
and
when
you
finished
dad
i
ca
stand
it
any
more
maybe
it
all
right
for
some
fellows
maybe
i
want
to
go
back
some
day
but
me
i
want
to
get
into
mechanics
i
think
i
get
to
be
a
good
inventor
there
a
fellow
that
would
give
me
twenty
dollars
a
week
in
a
factory
right
well
babbitt
crossed
the
floor
slowly
ponderously
seeming
a
little
old
i
always
wanted
you
to
have
a
college
he
meditatively
stamped
across
the
floor
again
but
i
never
now
for
heaven
sake
do
repeat
this
to
your
mother
or
she
remove
what
little
hair
i
got
left
but
practically
i
never
done
a
single
thing
i
wanted
to
in
my
whole
life
i
do
know
i
accomplished
anything
except
just
get
along
i
figure
out
i
made
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
out
of
a
possible
hundred
rods
well
maybe
you
carry
things
on
further
i
do
know
but
i
do
get
a
kind
of
sneaking
pleasure
out
of
the
fact
that
you
knew
what
you
wanted
to
do
and
did
it
well
those
folks
in
there
will
try
to
bully
you
and
tame
you
down
tell
to
go
to
the
devil
i
back
you
take
your
factory
job
if
you
want
to
do
be
scared
of
the
family
no
nor
all
of
zenith
nor
of
yourself
the
way
i
been
go
ahead
old
man
the
world
is
yours
arms
about
each
other
shoulders
the
babbitt
men
marched
into
the
and
faced
the
swooping
family
