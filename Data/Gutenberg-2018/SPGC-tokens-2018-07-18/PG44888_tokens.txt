cambridge
ever
panting
and
for
ever
acknowledgment
is
here
made
to
the
saturday
evening
post
philadelphia
in
which
these
papers
first
saw
the
diary
mamma
left
for
home
this
afternoon
as
i
want
to
be
perfectly
truthful
in
my
diary
i
suppose
i
must
confess
that
before
she
actually
went
away
i
sometimes
thought
i
should
be
rather
relieved
when
she
was
no
longer
here
mamma
has
a
fixed
idea
that
i
came
to
college
for
the
express
purpose
of
getting
my
feet
wet
by
day
and
sleeping
in
a
draught
by
night
she
began
the
furnishing
of
my
rooms
by
investing
in
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
kind
you
tie
around
your
waist
with
a
string
the
clerk
in
the
shop
asked
her
if
i
was
fond
of
and
she
explained
to
him
that
i
had
always
lived
in
the
west
where
the
climate
was
dry
and
that
she
did
n
t
know
how
i
would
stand
the
dampness
of
the
seacoast
mamma
thought
the
clerk
was
so
interested
in
my
last
attack
of
tonsillitis
i
didn
t
have
the
heart
to
tell
her
that
all
the
time
he
was
looking
sympathetic
with
his
right
eye
he
was
winking
at
me
with
his
left
now
that
she
is
gone
however
i
don
t
see
how
i
could
have
thought
even
for
a
moment
that
i
should
be
glad
and
i
ve
been
sitting
here
for
an
hour
just
looking
at
my
room
and
all
the
nice
things
she
advised
me
about
and
helped
me
to
she
could
see
how
cosey
it
is
late
at
night
with
the
green
lamp
lighted
and
a
little
fire
going
it
is
n
t
really
cool
enough
for
a
fire
i
had
to
take
my
coat
off
for
a
while
the
room
got
so
i
was
anxious
to
know
how
the
andirons
looked
with
a
blaze
behind
them
i
suppose
she
is
lying
awake
in
the
thinking
of
me
she
made
me
move
my
bed
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
so
that
it
would
n
t
be
near
the
window
i
moved
it
back
again
but
i
think
now
i
ll
change
it
again
to
the
way
she
liked
it
of
course
i
was
disappointed
last
may
when
i
found
i
hadn
t
drawn
a
room
in
one
of
the
college
buildings
i
had
an
idea
that
if
you
did
n
t
live
in
one
of
the
buildings
owned
by
the
college
you
would
n
t
feel
somehow
as
if
you
belonged
before
i
arrived
in
cambridge
i
worried
a
good
deal
over
it
the
old
harvard
men
at
home
were
most
unsatisfactory
about
this
when
i
asked
their
advice
the
ones
who
had
lived
in
the
yard
when
they
were
in
college
seemed
to
think
there
was
n
t
any
particular
use
in
going
to
college
at
all
unless
you
could
live
either
in
their
old
rooms
or
some
in
the
same
building
and
the
ones
who
had
lived
outside
as
i
am
going
to
do
this
year
anyhow
said
the
college
buildings
were
nice
enough
in
their
way
but
if
i
could
only
get
the
dear
old
place
which
was
pulled
down
fifteen
years
ago
where
james
russell
lowell
had
scratched
his
name
on
the
and
where
somebody
else
i
ve
forgotten
who
it
was
crawled
up
the
big
chimney
when
the
sheriff
came
to
arrest
him
for
debt
and
was
discovered
because
he
did
not
crawl
far
enough
i
should
be
all
right
i
don
t
see
how
the
good
times
and
the
advantages
of
a
place
like
this
hold
out
for
so
long
everybody
who
has
been
here
speaks
as
if
he
had
about
used
them
up
well
we
found
rooms
pleading
to
be
rented
every
other
house
in
cambridge
has
a
student
s
room
to
let
card
in
the
window
even
some
of
the
rooms
in
the
yard
had
been
given
up
at
the
last
minute
by
fellows
who
flunked
their
exams
mamma
said
she
felt
very
sorry
for
the
poor
boys
and
after
that
the
enormity
of
my
having
been
conditioned
in
physics
and
solid
geometry
decreased
considerably
the
trouble
there
were
four
days
full
of
it
wasn
t
in
finding
a
good
place
but
in
trying
to
decide
on
some
one
place
for
a
while
it
looked
as
though
i
should
either
have
to
live
in
five
separate
of
them
over
a
mile
give
up
going
to
college
we
dragged
up
and
down
all
the
quiet
side
streets
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
yard
ringing
bells
and
asking
questions
until
the
words
i
should
like
to
look
at
and
what
is
the
price
of
began
to
sound
like
some
kind
of
a
silly
english
meisterschaft
system
several
times
when
we
were
very
tired
we
wandered
by
mistake
into
houses
we
had
been
to
before
this
made
the
landladies
exceedingly
peevish
but
mamma
said
it
was
just
as
well
because
now
we
knew
what
their
true
characters
really
were
we
found
that
we
could
rent
some
of
the
rooms
lighted
and
heated
but
most
of
them
were
merely
lit
and
het
all
the
houses
in
cambridge
and
many
of
the
buildings
in
the
yard
seemed
to
be
disgorging
roomfuls
of
old
furniture
and
consuming
cartloads
of
new
and
everywhere
we
went
we
met
strings
of
cheerful
energetic
mothers
with
tired
rather
sons
i
ve
seen
only
one
fellow
with
his
father
so
far
and
they
sort
of
apologized
for
the
fact
by
being
dressed
in
deep
mourning
at
the
end
of
three
days
we
d
picked
out
five
rooms
considered
in
a
lump
they
seemed
fine
but
tackling
them
separately
mamma
could
n
t
decide
which
one
was
least
objectionable
one
was
in
a
part
of
town
that
looked
damp
man
across
the
street
unfortunately
sneezed
just
as
we
were
passing
a
stone
wall
covered
with
green
moss
the
second
smelt
of
cooking
on
the
steps
of
the
third
a
groceryman
was
waiting
to
deliver
several
gallons
of
gasoline
this
one
was
almost
struck
off
the
list
the
fourth
was
near
the
river
we
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
in
that
part
of
town
when
the
tide
was
out
and
from
the
windows
of
the
fifth
there
was
a
merry
little
view
of
a
graveyard
we
simply
could
n
t
make
up
our
minds
and
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
narrow
rather
shabby
little
street
two
or
three
blocks
below
the
square
discussing
the
matter
when
a
door
behind
us
opened
and
a
mother
and
son
we
turned
to
look
came
out
followed
by
a
the
was
doing
the
talking
in
a
very
new
england
voice
for
all
three
the
mother
was
slim
and
pretty
and
had
on
a
beautiful
dress
that
went
when
she
walked
away
and
the
fellow
looked
like
her
he
was
very
handsome
well
i
m
real
glad
to
know
you
the
landlady
said
to
the
fellow
s
mother
jus
seems
s
if
i
could
n
t
rest
till
i
knew
the
young
men
s
folks
dustin
their
photographs
every
day
makes
it
sort
of
different
it
t
it
oh
ll
take
care
of
him
they
get
real
mad
at
me
the
young
men
do
sometimes
for
makin
them
change
their
shoes
when
it
s
and
makin
them
wear
their
rubber
coats
when
it
s
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
are
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
she
gave
the
fellow
a
roguish
look
and
he
and
his
mother
walked
up
the
street
laughing
as
if
they
were
very
much
pleased
i
think
said
mamma
who
had
become
strangely
animated
on
hearing
of
the
change
of
shoes
i
think
that
before
we
decide
on
one
of
these
five
rooms
we
ll
go
in
there
so
we
went
up
to
the
woman
who
had
lingered
outside
to
talk
baby
talk
to
a
cat
that
was
making
gothic
arches
of
itself
all
over
the
piazza
and
in
about
seven
minutes
by
the
watch
we
d
signed
the
lease
of
the
last
vacant
rooms
in
the
house
a
short
steep
staircase
like
the
companionway
of
a
ship
leads
up
to
a
landing
about
the
size
of
a
kitchen
table
the
edges
of
the
steps
are
covered
with
tin
and
are
terribly
slippery
the
door
on
the
left
opens
into
my
study
and
at
the
end
of
that
is
my
bedroom
and
next
to
that
is
a
great
big
bathroom
it
s
bigger
than
the
other
two
with
a
porcelain
tub
and
a
shower
which
i
am
to
share
with
the
fellow
who
lives
just
across
the
staircase
on
the
right
chester
the
landlady
says
all
the
young
men
thinks
an
awful
lot
of
that
bathroom
the
study
is
so
small
that
we
did
n
t
have
to
buy
as
much
furniture
as
we
expected
to
i
have
an
oak
desk
with
a
rolling
top
that
makes
a
noise
like
some
one
shovelling
coal
when
you
open
and
shut
it
and
usually
sticks
of
course
when
we
finally
got
it
out
from
town
boston
is
about
four
miles
from
cambridge
and
it
takes
anywhere
from
three
days
to
a
week
for
an
express
wagon
to
make
the
trip
we
found
that
it
was
much
too
large
to
go
up
the
staircase
but
chester
said
we
could
take
out
the
back
of
the
house
and
have
it
swung
up
to
the
room
on
young
men
always
did
that
when
they
wanted
pianos
or
sofas
or
desks
like
mine
i
wasn
t
present
at
the
operation
as
i
had
to
go
in
town
to
lunch
with
mamma
but
it
was
successfully
performed
by
a
real
handy
gentleman
from
down
gloucester
way
who
used
to
be
a
fisherman
and
is
a
carpenter
now
for
i
found
the
desk
in
the
room
when
i
returned
and
the
walls
of
the
house
looked
about
the
same
besides
the
desk
i
have
an
oak
chair
with
a
back
that
lets
up
and
down
by
means
of
a
brass
rod
its
cushions
are
covered
with
gray
corduroy
then
there
is
another
chair
a
revolving
one
very
painful
that
goes
with
the
desk
we
bought
a
bookcase
at
a
shop
just
off
the
square
from
an
odious
little
man
who
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
to
mamma
they
grow
up
won
t
they
it
looks
rather
bare
as
there
aren
t
any
books
in
it
yet
but
mamma
would
n
t
let
me
fill
it
although
right
next
door
to
the
place
where
we
bought
it
there
were
loads
of
books
in
the
window
for
five
and
ten
cents
apiece
we
got
some
turkish
rugs
at
an
auction
in
town
the
man
said
they
never
would
wear
out
when
they
arrived
here
and
i
saw
them
for
the
first
time
by
daylight
they
had
gas
at
the
sale
i
knew
what
he
meant
however
mamma
darned
them
very
nicely
and
as
everything
else
looks
so
new
perhaps
it
s
just
as
well
i
ve
put
the
photographs
of
mamma
and
papa
and
the
one
of
mildred
in
the
ball
dress
and
big
hat
with
white
ostrich
feathers
and
the
one
of
sidney
in
his
little
cart
with
the
two
goats
on
the
mantelpiece
i
m
afraid
i
never
cared
much
for
the
goats
when
i
was
at
home
but
i
ve
been
thinking
of
all
the
funny
things
they
used
to
do
and
wondering
if
i
ll
ever
see
them
again
they
re
such
cute
little
beasts
over
the
mantelpiece
i
have
two
crimson
flags
with
the
sticks
crossed
this
evening
while
i
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
trying
to
decide
whether
i
ought
to
begin
my
diary
now
or
wait
until
college
opened
and
things
began
to
happen
the
door
downstairs
suddenly
rattled
and
slammed
and
some
one
came
clattering
up
the
tin
steps
at
a
great
rate
then
the
door
across
the
landing
was
unlocked
and
i
heard
whoever
it
was
falling
over
chairs
and
upsetting
things
in
the
dark
and
all
the
time
he
kept
roaring
at
the
top
of
his
voice
oh
chester
chester
where
are
you
chester
had
told
me
a
few
minutes
before
that
she
was
just
goin
to
step
up
street
to
see
how
mis
buckson
s
comin
along
with
them
rooms
o
hers
so
i
called
out
that
she
was
n
t
at
home
then
the
voice
answered
oh
thank
you
and
after
a
few
more
things
in
the
other
room
had
fallen
on
the
floor
and
smashed
the
fellow
who
was
making
all
the
fuss
came
across
and
stood
in
my
doorway
i
thought
for
a
second
that
the
reason
he
did
n
t
come
in
was
that
he
was
so
big
he
could
n
t
i
knew
that
the
ceilings
of
the
house
were
low
and
that
my
study
wasn
t
very
large
but
i
had
n
t
realized
before
how
small
it
all
was
the
fellow
blocked
up
the
whole
doorway
his
shoulders
in
a
loose
shaggy
gray
coat
stretched
clear
across
his
face
was
burned
a
deep
brown
and
his
hair
was
very
black
and
looked
rather
long
as
it
evidently
had
n
t
been
brushed
for
a
good
while
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
could
let
him
have
a
match
i
could
see
that
he
was
taking
in
my
room
as
he
stood
there
and
i
think
he
smiled
a
little
at
something
but
then
he
seemed
to
be
smiling
anyhow
in
a
different
way
so
i
was
n
t
sure
i
jumped
up
and
got
him
a
box
of
matches
somehow
i
knew
at
once
that
he
wasn
t
the
other
freshman
who
has
rooms
in
the
house
although
i
can
t
think
why
as
he
did
n
t
look
old
and
he
thanked
me
saying
he
was
sorry
to
trouble
me
and
went
back
to
his
room
i
felt
sort
of
excited
and
restless
after
that
and
thought
i
would
sit
down
and
write
mamma
all
about
him
but
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
he
stopped
humming
i
don
t
think
he
can
be
a
member
of
the
glee
club
as
he
only
struck
the
right
note
once
by
accident
still
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
was
trying
to
sing
and
began
to
laugh
then
he
came
over
to
my
door
again
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
said
you
did
n
t
happen
to
see
an
iron
bedstead
lying
around
the
streets
anywhere
did
you
the
good
chester
has
evidently
spent
the
last
three
months
in
putting
my
rooms
in
order
and
i
can
t
find
a
thing
i
told
him
i
had
seen
a
bed
in
the
back
yard
this
afternoon
but
that
i
did
n
t
think
it
could
be
his
he
asked
me
very
seriously
why
not
and
then
all
at
once
i
got
horribly
rattled
i
didn
t
like
to
tell
him
that
the
bed
had
n
t
looked
nearly
big
enough
for
him
it
was
a
little
narrow
thing
for
i
was
afraid
he
might
think
me
fresh
then
besides
i
found
that
i
had
instinctively
stood
up
when
i
saw
him
and
as
there
wasn
t
any
particular
reason
why
i
should
have
done
this
i
got
sort
of
confused
of
course
it
s
a
very
nice
little
bed
i
hastened
to
add
whereupon
he
burst
out
laughing
with
a
loud
whoop
if
it
s
such
a
nice
one
it
certainly
can
t
be
mine
and
i
d
better
go
down
and
swipe
it
right
away
he
said
at
last
and
clattered
downstairs
i
tried
again
to
write
to
mamma
but
he
made
such
a
noise
coming
upstairs
with
pieces
of
bed
and
running
down
again
that
i
could
n
t
fix
my
mind
then
too
i
kept
wondering
whether
i
ought
to
offer
to
help
him
finally
i
went
out
as
he
was
coming
up
with
a
mattress
on
his
shoulder
and
asked
was
it
your
bed
after
all
which
made
him
laugh
again
and
say
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
for
anything
in
the
world
if
you
aren
t
too
busy
though
i
wish
you
would
help
me
put
the
beastly
thing
together
we
tried
for
about
half
an
hour
to
make
the
bed
stand
up
it
looked
simple
enough
but
whenever
we
got
the
sides
firm
and
more
or
less
parallel
the
back
and
front
would
wobble
and
fall
to
the
floor
once
we
had
all
four
pieces
standing
beautifully
but
just
as
we
put
on
the
woven
wire
business
and
duggie
that
s
what
chester
calls
don
t
think
it
s
his
real
name
though
exclaimed
i
have
the
honor
to
report
sir
that
the
allied
forces
have
taken
new
bedford
the
whole
thing
collapsed
and
pinched
his
finger
fearfully
as
it
came
down
after
that
we
sat
on
the
floor
awhile
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
glanced
meditatively
at
the
ruins
of
the
bed
every
now
and
then
and
at
last
turned
to
me
and
said
is
this
your
first
year
here
i
didn
t
let
him
see
how
pleased
i
was
that
he
had
not
discovered
i
was
a
freshman
and
merely
answered
yes
we
talked
a
long
all
kinds
of
things
i
asked
him
a
string
of
questions
that
had
been
on
my
mind
for
months
whether
it
is
better
to
live
in
a
private
house
one
of
the
big
private
halls
or
in
the
yard
i
called
it
the
campus
and
he
looked
queer
for
a
moment
and
said
it
was
known
as
the
yard
here
where
would
be
a
good
place
to
eat
whether
he
thought
my
allowance
was
big
enough
i
told
him
how
much
i
was
going
to
have
and
what
was
the
best
way
to
make
friends
and
get
on
teams
and
clubs
and
musical
societies
and
crews
and
papers
he
answered
everything
although
once
or
twice
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
looked
at
me
a
good
while
before
speaking
i
couldn
t
tell
whether
the
questions
had
n
t
occurred
to
him
before
or
whether
he
didn
t
know
just
what
to
tell
me
of
course
i
can
t
remember
all
he
said
but
it
sounded
so
important
that
afterward
i
scribbled
as
much
of
it
as
i
could
in
a
notebook

i
was
just
going
to
ask
him
something
else
when
we
heard
chester
exclaiming
land
sakes
if
it
ain
t
duggie
i
saw
the
light
from
mis
buckson
s
parlor
hello
you
dear
old
buzzard
how
dare
you
turn
me
out
in
the
cold
this
way
he
called
to
her
and
as
she
came
in
he
jumped
up
and
took
both
her
hands
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
again
she
gave
him
a
little
push
and
looked
pleased
law
you
talk
he
s
got
real
t
he
she
added
looking
at
me
she
asked
him
where
he
d
been
all
summer
and
he
told
her
he
d
been
off
shooting
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
had
brought
her
a
breastpin
made
of
an
elk
s
tooth
that
she
d
have
to
wear
on
sundays
when
she
went
to
see
her
married
daughter
in
somerville
i
thought
i
ought
to
leave
but
did
not
know
how
to
interrupt
them
exactly
so
i
turned
and
examined
some
silver
cups
on
the
mantelpiece
there
were
five
beauties
but
i
could
n
t
make
out
the
inscriptions
on
them
you
ve
had
lots
of
visitors
the
last
few
days
they
kept
to
find
out
when
you
ll
be
back
the
dean
was
here
real
sociable
gentleman
aren
t
he
he
wants
you
to
go
right
round
and
see
him
as
soon
as
you
can
and
yesterday
that
little
forget
his
you
know
he
s
the
president
of
the
to
find
out
about
something
he
said
you
were
the
only
one
who
could
tell
him
and
then
there
ve
been
lots
of
young
men
to
see
about
the
my
just
crowds
of
them
and
they
all
left
notes
i
ll
run
down
and
get
them
and
then
i
ll
put
up
your
bed
after
she
left
i
said
it
s
awfully
late
and
i
have
to
get
up
early
to
be
in
time
to
register
i
wonder
who
he
is
i
hope
he
didn
t
think
i
was
fresh
i
don
t
believe
he
did
though
for
as
i
was
going
he
said
we
re
such
near
neighbors
you
must
drop
in
when
you
haven
t
anything
better
to
do
mamma
s
train
must
have
passed
utica
by
this
time
well
i
ve
learned
a
lot
of
things
during
the
past
week
that
are
n
t
advertised
in
the
catalogue
if
i
ve
neglected
to
make
a
note
of
them
until
now
it
has
been
my
misfortune
and
not
my
fault
we
registered
on
wednesday
have
to
register
the
day
before
college
really
i
confess
i
was
a
little
disappointed
at
the
informal
way
such
an
important
act
of
one
s
life
is
done
in
the
first
place
as
you
can
drop
in
any
time
between
nine
and
one
you
don
t
see
the
whole
class
together
then
the
room
we
registered
in
might
have
been
in
the
high
school
at
home
i
don
t
know
what
i
expected
exactly
but
it
certainly
was
n
t
a
bare
square
room
a
desk
on
a
low
platform
some
plaster
casts
and
a
lot
of
plain
wooden
chairs
arranged
in
rows
on
an
inclined
plane
however
when
i
think
the
matter
over
i
don
t
see
what
else
they
could
have
a
little
man
with
a
red
necktie
sat
reading
a
newspaper
at
the
desk
when
i
went
in
and
near
a
a
younger
fellow
who
looked
as
if
he
might
be
a
student
there
were
piles
of
registration
cards
on
the
desk
and
after
i
had
stood
there
a
moment
not
knowing
what
to
do
the
little
man
looked
up
absently
from
his
paper
handed
me
some
cards
with
a
feeble
sort
of
gesture
and
murmured
in
a
melancholy
slightly
trembling
and
very
sarcastic
voice
this
gentleman
is
come
to
me
with
commendation
from
great
potentates
and
here
he
means
to
spend
his
time
awhile
then
he
yawned
and
took
up
the
paper
again
the
young
man
without
apparently
thinking
this
remark
in
the
least
odd
closed
his
book
on
his
thumb
so
as
not
to
lose
the
place
and
gave
me
another
card
saying
in
a
perfectly
businesslike
voice
please
fill
this
one
out
too
i
sat
down
at
a
bench
to
write
and
just
then
five
or
six
other
fellows
came
in
one
of
them
was
the
chap
with
the
pretty
mother
who
rooms
in
the
same
house
with
me
i
hadn
t
seen
him
since
the
day
i
signed
my
lease
i
listened
to
hear
if
the
little
man
at
the
desk
would
spring
anything
weird
on
them
but
as
they
went
right
up
to
him
and
took
cards
as
if
they
knew
all
about
it
and
retreated
to
the
back
of
the
room
he
didn
t
have
time
they
talked
and
laughed
a
good
deal
and
once
they
got
into
a
scuffle
but
the
instructors
didn
t
even
glance
up
i
finished
answering
the
questions
on
my
cards
and
was
reading
them
over
when
one
of
the
fellows
behind
me
said
i
ll
ask
live
in
the
same
house
and
the
handsome
one
came
and
sat
down
beside
me
there
was
something
they
did
n
t
understand
in
making
out
the
cards
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
they
were
all
gathered
around
me
examining
mine
i
felt
quite
important
but
the
next
minute
i
felt
equally
cheap
the
cards
that
had
been
given
us
by
the
young
man
with
the
book
had
to
be
filled
out
with
one
s
name
and
address
and
religion
when
the
one
whose
name
i
ve
since
found
out
is
berrisford
came
to
it
he
began
to
giggle
and
after
he
had
written
on
it
he
showed
it
to
the
man
next
to
him
who
burst
out
laughing
and
passed
it
on
to
the
others
they
all
laughed
as
soon
as
they
saw
it
and
i
was
just
about
to
hold
out
my
hand
to
take
it
when
the
young
instructor
closed
his
book
and
said
in
a
rather
tired
dry
tone
by
the
way
unless
you
actually
happen
to
be
buddhists
or
hindus
or
mohammedans
or
followers
of
confucius
kindly
refrain
from
saying
so
on
the
card
only
four
men
have
indulged
in
that
particular
jest
this
morning
which
in
comparison
with
former
years
is
really
very
few
i
begin
to
feel
encouraged
pray
don
t
depress
me
i
don
t
know
what
berrisford
had
written
but
he
got
very
red
while
the
instructor
was
speaking
and
crumpled
the
card
into
a
little
lump
which
he
afterward
slipped
into
his
pocket
the
others
pretended
to
be
deeply
absorbed
in
their
writing
just
then
but
one
of
them
snorted
hysterically
if
anything
like
that
had
happened
to
me
i
think
i
should
have
expired
with
mortification
but
berrisford
after
a
minute
or
two
did
n
t
seem
to
mind
it
at
all
i
almost
think
it
encouraged
him
to
do
something
even
more
idiotic
there
are
two
large
fine
statues
standing
in
the
front
corners
of
the
room
one
of
them
is
a
greek
athlete
in
the
act
of
hurling
something
not
unlike
a
pancake
and
is
called
i
believe
the
discus
thrower
we
have
a
little
one
in
the
library
at
home
the
other
is
a
venerable
old
man
in
flowing
homer
or
sophocles
or
some
such
person
well
we
had
all
gone
up
to
the
desk
with
our
cards
berrisford
was
first
and
just
as
he
got
there
he
stopped
without
giving
his
cards
to
the
little
man
who
reached
out
for
them
and
looked
inquiringly
from
statue
to
statue
berrisford
has
a
beautiful
silly
face
with
big
innocent
eyes
and
when
he
talks
his
manner
is
timid
you
can
t
help
liking
it
i
could
see
that
he
impressed
the
instructors
just
the
way
he
did
mamma
and
me
the
day
we
saw
him
with
his
mother
he
looked
at
the
statues
a
moment
and
then
said
to
the
little
man
would
you
mind
telling
me
please
which
of
these
gentlemen
is
the
president
of
the
college
his
voice
was
so
deferential
and
there
was
something
so
eager
and
earnest
and
pure
in
his
expression
i
really
believe
that
for
a
moment
the
instructor
thought
he
was
just
a
nice
fool
and
was
on
the
point
of
kindly
explaining
what
the
statues
represented
he
didn
t
though
for
one
of
the
fellows
in
the
background
tittered
and
ran
out
of
the
room
and
the
little
man
leaned
back
in
his
chair
examined
berrisford
very
deliberately
and
then
remarked
in
his
queer
sarcastic
way
sir
thy
wit
is
as
quick
as
the
greyhound
s
mouth
but
it
speeds
too
twill
tire
as
soon
as
we
got
outside
berrisford
said
what
a
disappointing
little
creature
i
had
an
idea
he
would
be
very
angry
and
he
was
n
t
at
all
did
you
want
him
to
be
angry
i
asked
rather
surprised
why
yes
of
course
he
answered
it
s
so
interesting
to
watch
them
there
are
so
many
different
ways
of
losing
a
temper
are
the
most
satisfactory
i
think
i
discovered
that
last
spring
on
my
way
to
europe
i
go
up
to
them
when
they
re
very
getting
out
of
a
harbor
or
exclaim
oh
i
say
i
steer
you
can
t
imagine
how
furious
it
makes
them
i
said
i
thought
i
could
and
we
parted
he
seems
to
have
a
great
many
friends
he
has
n
t
spent
a
night
at
home
since
college
week
ago
well
i
went
to
see
my
adviser
who
helped
me
select
my
studies
for
the
year
that
is
to
say
he
hypnotized
me
into
taking
a
lot
of
things
i
really
don
t
see
why
i
should
know
however
as
i
don
t
seem
to
have
what
he
called
a
startling
predilection
for
anything
my
entrance
exams
divulged
this
and
as
he
was
a
pleasant
young
man
who
invited
me
to
dinner
next
week
i
allowed
myself
to
be
influenced
by
him
he
gave
me
a
lot
of
little
pamphlets
with
the
courses
and
the
hours
at
which
they
come
marked
in
red
ink
i
ve
forgotten
what
some
of
them
are
as
we
have
n
t
had
any
real
lectures
rigmaroles
about
what
books
to
buy
for
the
first
few
days
the
whole
college
and
all
the
streets
and
buildings
near
it
seemed
to
be
in
such
confusion
that
i
couldn
t
walk
a
block
without
feeling
terribly
way
i
used
to
feel
when
i
was
a
kid
and
we
were
all
going
to
the
state
fair
or
the
circus
and
mamma
would
insist
on
our
eating
luncheon
although
we
did
n
t
want
a
thing
along
the
sidewalk
in
the
square
there
was
a
barricade
of
trunks
so
high
that
you
could
n
t
see
over
it
to
say
nothing
of
huge
mounds
of
travelling
bags
and
cases
and
leather
things
with
banjos
and
mandolins
and
guitars
and
in
them
and
from
morning
till
night
there
were
always
at
least
four
or
five
fellows
telling
the
expressmen
that
it
was
perfectly
absurd
that
they
simply
had
to
have
their
trunks
immediately
that
the
service
was
abominable
and
that
the
whole
place
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
behind
the
times
anyhow
all
of
which
the
expressmen
may
or
may
not
have
agreed
with
for
they
hardly
ever
answered
back
and
just
went
on
digging
steamer
trunks
and
hatboxes
out
of
the
ruins
and
slamming
them
into
wagons
to
make
room
for
the
loads
that
kept
arriving
every
little
while
from
town
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
so
many
fellows
of
my
own
age
or
a
little
older
hurrying
about
or
standing
in
groups
talking
and
laughing
and
looking
glad
to
be
here
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
sort
of
unsatisfactory
and
hopeless
i
didn
t
like
to
stay
in
my
room
much
of
the
time
as
i
had
a
feeling
i
have
n
t
got
over
it
yet
that
if
i
did
i
might
miss
something
yet
when
i
went
out
i
had
so
few
things
to
do
that
unless
i
took
a
of
course
leads
one
away
from
the
was
n
t
much
point
in
my
being
around
at
all
no
one
stuck
his
head
from
an
upper
window
in
the
yard
and
called
out
tommy
wood
come
up
here
when
passed
by
and
no
one
slipped
up
behind
me
and
put
his
hands
over
my
eyes
and
waited
for
me
to
guess
who
it
was
because
with
the
exception
of
duggie
and
dick
benton
and
berrisford
i
didn
t
know
a
soul
i
often
saw
duggie
in
the
square
but
as
he
was
always
with
a
crowd
or
striding
along
in
a
great
hurry
and
being
stopped
every
few
feet
by
some
one
who
asked
him
questions
that
made
him
laugh
and
run
away
i
got
a
chance
to
speak
to
him
only
once
he
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
in
a
professional
kind
of
way
without
in
the
least
remembering
who
i
was
dick
benton
i
did
n
t
have
any
hesitation
in
going
right
up
to
as
at
home
i
had
heard
him
solemnly
promise
mamma
that
he
would
look
out
for
me
and
keep
his
eye
on
me
of
course
i
don
t
expect
him
to
do
this
but
i
confess
i
did
feel
sort
of
disappointed
for
a
minute
when
he
said
well
wood
he
calls
me
tommy
at
home
when
did
you
arrive
getting
settled
got
your
courses
picked
out
awful
bore
is
n
t
it
well
here
s
my
to
meet
some
people
in
town
and
am
late
now
how
s
wood
so
glad
hunt
me
up
when
you
re
settled
so
long
he
swung
himself
on
a
passing
car
and
i
turned
away
and
stared
at
a
shop
window
i
must
have
stood
there
several
minutes
before
i
realized
it
was
a
bakery
and
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
look
at
behind
the
glass
except
three
loaves
of
bread
and
a
dish
of
imitation
ice
cream
that
had
n
t
been
dusted
for
weeks
it
has
just
this
minute
occurred
to
me
for
the
first
time
that
i
must
have
been
homesick
that
day
and
the
next
isn
t
it
queer
i
didn
t
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
bet
i
can
describe
every
article
in
every
shop
window
in
the
square
for
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
the
first
few
days
except
to
walk
up
and
down
and
pretend
i
was
going
somewhere
of
course
i
tried
to
get
the
books
the
various
instructors
told
me
about
but
every
time
i
asked
for
them
at
the
three
bookstores
i
found
either
that
the
last
one
had
just
been
sold
or
that
they
had
n
t
arrived
yet
muldooney
s
tables
were
unfortunately
full
when
i
applied
and
i
have
been
eating
around
at
the
most
ridiculous
parlors
and
dairy
restaurants
where
you
sit
on
high
stools
and
grab
things
because
you
can
t
get
over
the
feeling
that
a
conductor
will
stick
his
head
in
the
door
pretty
soon
and
say
all
on
bloody
monday
night
the
freshmen
reception
took
place
i
scarcely
know
how
to
touch
on
that
event
as
my
part
in
it
or
rather
in
what
followed
was
so
unexpectedly
prominent
and
terrible
the
old
college
men
at
home
had
let
drop
all
kinds
of
mysterious
hints
about
bloody
monday
in
their
time
apparently
it
was
the
custom
for
the
to
send
grewsome
notices
to
the
freshmen
telling
them
what
would
happen
if
they
did
n
t
have
a
punch
in
their
rooms
on
that
occasion
these
warnings
were
written
in
blood
and
began
and
ended
with
a
skull
and
then
in
the
evening
there
was
a
rush
in
the
yard
between
the
freshmen
and
sophomores
the
old
graduates
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
punches
had
been
given
up
long
ago
but
i
don
t
think
they
liked
to
admit
it
even
to
they
do
groan
a
good
deal
about
college
days
not
being
what
they
used
to
be
from
what
they
said
i
could
not
tell
whether
there
really
were
such
things
nowadays
or
not
so
i
wrote
a
little
note
to
duggie
and
left
it
on
the
stairs
where
the
postman
puts
our
letters
asking
him
what
to
do
if
i
got
a
notice
and
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
rush
he
answered
the
custom
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
it
must
have
been
great
sport
as
for
the
we
don
t
have
it
by
the
way
my
name
chester
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
is
not
duggie
but
douglas
sherwin
at
that
time
i
did
n
t
know
what
the
second
sentence
of
his
note
meant
but
i
understand
now
it
dawned
on
me
during
the
speeches
at
the
reception
in
some
mysterious
indescribable
way
it
was
communicated
to
me
as
i
sat
there
in
the
crowded
theatre
whether
it
came
to
me
most
from
my
into
the
seats
and
standing
in
rows
against
the
from
the
professors
who
spoke
on
the
stage
i
can
t
say
i
simply
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
something
was
going
to
that
wasn
t
on
the
program
it
was
in
the
made
me
restless
and
i
could
n
t
help
thinking
of
that
sultry
afternoon
out
west
when
the
seven
stampeded
just
as
we
were
about
to
start
i
knew
the
little
devils
were
going
to
do
something
and
they
knew
it
too
for
they
all
began
to
buck
at
the
same
instant
but
i
hadn
t
said
anything
about
neither
had
they
it
was
just
like
that
while
the
speeches
of
welcome
were
being
made
in
sanders
theatre
they
were
fine
speeches
they
really
did
make
you
welcome
and
part
of
it
a
way
you
hadn
t
thought
of
before
you
couldn
t
help
being
proud
that
you
belonged
and
after
the
president
had
spoken
and
the
fellow
next
to
me
yelled
in
my
ear
he
had
to
yell
the
cheering
was
so
loud
he
s
a
great
man
all
right
i
felt
all
over
that
he
was
a
great
did
but
nevertheless
there
was
something
else
tingling
through
the
noise
and
excitement
that
we
felt
just
as
much
the
professors
themselves
felt
it
the
elaborate
way
in
which
every
one
of
them
ignored
the
subject
of
bloody
monday
was
almost
pathetic
the
dean
in
his
speech
ignored
it
so
radiantly
that
the
audience
actually
laughed
theoretically
as
douglas
sherwin
had
said
there
would
be
no
rush
the
speeches
made
one
quite
ashamed
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
was
n
t
there
when
it
started
for
after
the
speeches
i
went
with
the
crowd
into
the
great
to
be
received
it
would
be
nice
i
thought
to
be
introduced
to
the
distinguished
men
and
to
get
to
know
some
of
my
classmates
every
one
was
trying
to
move
toward
the
further
corner
of
the
vast
place
and
i
soon
found
myself
hemmed
in
and
so
with
the
tide
it
was
very
hot
and
as
i
am
not
particularly
tall
i
would
more
than
once
have
given
a
good
deal
to
be
out
in
the
fresh
night
air
but
the
thought
of
shaking
hands
with
the
president
and
the
gentleman
who
invented
plane
geometry
i
did
n
t
know
whether
he
had
anything
to
do
with
solid
or
not
i
never
studied
it
and
another
gentleman
a
humorist
who
wrote
a
book
and
called
it
the
easy
greek
reader
cheered
me
up
i
knew
too
that
mamma
would
be
glad
to
hear
i
had
talked
to
these
men
but
when
after
at
least
half
an
hour
of
waiting
and
pushing
i
reached
the
corner
of
the
room
i
discovered
that
it
was
n
t
the
distinguished
men
we
had
all
along
been
gasping
and
struggling
for
it
was
the
ice
cream
the
distinguished
men
were
lined
up
away
across
the
room
all
alone
if
it
had
been
rumored
beforehand
that
they
were
indisposed
with
the
plague
they
could
n
t
have
been
much
more
detached
every
now
and
then
some
young
an
snatch
a
freshman
from
the
throng
say
something
in
his
ear
it
looked
as
if
he
were
murmuring
they
re
all
perfectly
you
mustn
t
prod
them
or
throw
things
in
the
cage
and
march
him
up
to
be
introduced
i
watched
these
proceedings
awhile
and
then
as
the
ice
cream
in
the
meanwhile
had
given
out
i
left
and
started
to
walk
to
my
room
by
way
of
the
yard
a
sound
of
confused
cheering
reached
me
the
moment
i
got
outside
and
when
i
passed
through
the
gate
i
could
see
down
the
long
quadrangle
what
seemed
to
be
a
battle
of
swaying
shifting
meeting
parting
revolving
myriad
of
flickering
lights
and
lurid
faces
i
ran
until
i
reached
the
edge
of
the
crowd
and
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
staring
and
listening
the
fellows
were
surging
wildly
up
and
down
and
across
the
yard
with
torches
in
their
hands
cheering
and
singing
whenever
enough
men
got
together
they
would
lower
their
torches
and
charge
the
whole
length
of
the
a
howl
of
a
company
of
lancers
then
by
the
time
they
had
turned
to
plough
back
again
another
group
would
have
formed
which
usually
met
the
first
one
with
a
terrible
roar
and
a
clash
of
tin
torches
drench
of
kerosene
and
a
burst
of
flame
two
german
bands
that
never
stopped
playing
the
blue
danube
and
the
washington
post
were
huddled
at
either
end
of
the
yard
now
and
then
a
sort
of
tidal
wave
of
lights
and
faces
and
frantic
hands
would
swell
rapidly
toward
them
lap
them
up
engulf
them
and
then
go
swirling
back
again
to
the
middle
but
they
never
stopped
playing
when
they
became
hopelessly
scattered
and
horribly
reunited
i
saw
two
policemen
fluttering
distractedly
on
the
of
conscious
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
things
as
i
was
standing
there
wondering
where
i
could
get
a
torch
a
slim
man
with
an
beard
bustled
up
to
them
and
the
three
held
a
sort
of
hurried
consultation
it
ended
by
the
man
s
he
was
a
professor
suddenly
leaving
them
and
mounting
the
steps
of
university
hall
his
expression
as
he
turned
to
face
the
crowd
was
the
kind
that
tries
its
best
to
be
persuasive
and
popular
and
tremendously
resolute
all
at
once
but
only
succeeds
in
being
wan
and
furtive
he
filled
his
lungs
and
began
to
talk
i
suppose
as
loud
as
he
could
yet
all
i
heard
was
an
occasional
despairing
now
fellows
it
seems
to
me
fellows
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
better
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
however
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
crowd
had
crushed
itself
as
far
away
as
it
could
into
the
quadrangle
s
lower
end
i
made
my
way
over
there
and
as
i
was
pushing
into
the
thick
of
things
a
man
next
to
me
exclaimed
to
no
one
in
particular
they
ve
sent
for
duggie
sherwin
the
captain
of
the
team
as
a
last
s
going
to
say
something
from
the
porch
of
matthews
i
saw
i
never
could
get
near
matthews
by
trying
to
forge
straight
ahead
so
as
i
wanted
to
hear
duggie
i
hadn
t
known
until
that
minute
what
he
was
i
extricated
myself
and
ran
around
the
edge
of
the
crowd
even
then
i
wasn
t
very
near
and
although
i
could
n
t
hear
a
word
he
said
i
could
see
on
a
above
everybody
and
smiling
a
little
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
i
didn
t
know
what
he
said
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
think
anybody
did
except
perhaps
the
men
right
around
him
yet
in
about
a
minute
two
or
three
fellows
began
to
yell
all
over
the
stuff
is
off
and
will
you
be
good
and
the
crowd
fell
back
a
little
attempting
to
spread
out
the
spell
somehow
was
broken
for
owing
to
duggie
s
wonderful
influence
we
would
have
dispersed
quietly
if
it
had
n
t
been
for
that
flighty
idiot
berrisford
i
had
picked
up
a
torch
that
some
one
had
thrown
away
and
was
moving
along
with
it
when
berrisford
dashed
up
to
me
with
something
the
size
of
a
in
a
newspaper
one
of
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
was
gone
he
was
breathing
hard
and
seemed
to
be
fearfully
excited
it
s
your
turn
now
he
gasped
and
thrust
the
parcel
into
my
hand
is
it
are
we
going
to
do
the
rush
is
over
i
answered
for
i
did
n
t
understand
of
course
the
rush
is
he
said
hurriedly
we
re
playing
a
game
the
king
s
helmet
you
re
it
i
i
m
not
any
more
you
are
now
hurry
up
for
heaven
s
sake
or
they
ll
get
it
here
they
for
all
you
re
worth
it
may
mean
a
lot
for
the
class
this
last
and
the
fact
of
my
catching
sight
just
then
of
some
men
running
toward
me
decided
me
i
clutched
the
parcel
to
my
side
and
scudded
down
the
yard
every
one
fell
back
to
let
me
pass
and
my
progress
was
followed
by
screams
of
delight
i
never
had
attracted
so
much
attention
before
and
from
the
things
that
were
shouted
at
me
as
i
flew
along
i
knew
i
was
doing
well
at
the
end
of
the
yard
i
ran
smash
into
a
building
but
although
somewhat
dazed
i
managed
to
hang
on
to
the
parcel
turn
and
look
back
the
only
person
pursuing
me
apparently
was
a
bareheaded
he
was
alarmingly
near
but
i
managed
to
pass
him
and
on
my
return
trip
i
noticed
that
i
received
even
a
greater
ovation
than
the
one
the
fellows
had
given
me
at
first
i
did
n
t
know
what
it
all
meant
and
i
was
nearly
dead
and
suddenly
tripped
staggered
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
a
second
policeman
who
handled
me
very
roughly
and
seized
berrisford
s
package
it
contained
the
helmet
of
the
bareheaded
one
who
arrived
in
a
moment
exceedingly
exhausted
but
able
nevertheless
to
shake
his
fist
in
my
face
the
parade
to
the
police
station
must
have
been
several
blocks
heard
about
it
afterward
first
there
was
me
with
an
escort
of
two
officers
all
the
muckers
in
cambridge
and
the
freshman
class
in
a
body
who
started
a
collection
on
the
way
over
with
which
to
bail
me
out
then
there
was
a
german
band
playing
the
blue
danube
and
after
that
a
vast
concourse
as
berrisford
called
it
of
sophomores
upperclassmen
and
law
students
with
another
german
band
playing
the
washington
post
in
their
midst
i
was
almost
paralyzed
with
fright
and
my
head
ached
dreadfully
from
the
blow
i
had
given
it
against
the
building
but
although
i
did
n
t
show
it
i
could
n
t
help
feeling
furious
at
berrisford
he
stayed
right
behind
me
on
the
way
over
and
kept
saying
at
intervals
it
s
all
right
old
man
don
t
s
no
use
worrying
just
leave
everything
to
me
perhaps
after
all
my
troubles
were
for
the
best
it
was
not
my
fault
that
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
law
nothing
was
further
from
my
thoughts
than
a
desire
to
be
disorderly
of
course
the
teasing
i
have
had
to
endure
is
pretty
hard
and
it
is
most
annoying
to
acquire
a
nickname
at
the
outset
everybody
calls
me
trusting
thomas
or
tommy
trusting
and
although
i
realize
now
that
i
was
pretty
easy
to
do
what
berrisford
told
me
to
my
conscience
has
been
untroubled
from
the
first
that
after
all
is
the
main
thing
berrisford
i
think
would
have
tried
as
he
said
to
smooth
it
all
over
at
the
police
station
but
very
fortunately
the
arrival
of
the
regent
and
my
adviser
and
the
man
at
once
took
the
matter
out
of
his
hands
i
don
t
know
what
they
did
to
the
officers
but
i
was
quickly
transferred
from
the
police
station
to
the
room
of
my
adviser
it
was
more
or
less
impossible
to
return
the
money
that
had
been
collected
from
the
class
to
bail
me
out
with
so
just
as
i
left
a
fellow
with
a
loud
voice
proposed
amid
great
cheering
to
give
it
to
the
freshman
eleven
there
had
been
something
spectacular
and
brilliant
about
my
progress
from
the
yard
to
the
that
terrified
though
i
was
i
could
not
help
appreciating
in
an
abject
wretched
sort
of
a
way
but
the
silent
walk
down
a
back
street
to
the
hall
in
which
my
adviser
lives
was
just
common
or
garden
melancholy
the
sidewalk
was
broad
so
we
swung
along
four
abreast
no
one
followed
us
of
course
and
we
went
the
entire
distance
in
almost
unbroken
silence
once
the
regent
cleared
his
throat
and
said
in
hard
cheerful
deliberate
tones
i
see
by
the
evening
paper
that
japan
will
not
accede
to
the
request
of
the
powers
no
one
answered
for
about
a
minute
and
i
began
to
fear
that
neither
my
adviser
nor
the
man
would
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
exclaim
what
a
wonderful
little
people
they
are
i
was
vaguely
disappointed
for
of
course
when
the
japanese
are
mentioned
one
instinctively
waits
for
somebody
to
say
this
however
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
lose
hope
and
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
risk
the
comment
myself
the
man
burst
out
with
what
a
remarkable
little
people
they
are
and
my
foolish
heart
was
reassured
i
must
say
that
when
we
reached
our
destination
and
the
inquisition
began
they
three
of
fair
and
square
the
circumstances
of
my
capture
were
decidedly
against
me
and
my
defence
i
realized
sounded
simply
foolish
at
one
point
my
adviser
jumped
up
abruptly
and
closed
a
window
i
think
he
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
laugh
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
tell
my
story
how
i
had
watched
the
rush
from
the
bottom
of
the
steps
how
i
had
gone
over
to
hear
duggie
s
speech
and
how
berrisford
i
didn
t
give
his
name
however
had
come
up
to
me
with
the
helmet
in
a
newspaper
and
told
me
we
were
playing
a
game
and
that
i
was
it
i
felt
very
earnest
and
tremulous
when
i
began
but
by
the
time
i
finished
i
could
n
t
help
wanting
to
shut
a
few
windows
myself
of
the
whole
howling
had
succeeded
in
seizing
one
miserable
little
freshman
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
actual
disturbance
struck
me
as
being
like
something
in
an
imbecile
farce
it
impressed
the
others
i
think
in
much
the
same
way
although
the
man
after
a
moment
of
silence
said
do
you
really
expect
us
to
believe
all
this
no
sir
i
answered
i
don
t
see
how
you
conscientiously
can
but
they
decided
to
believe
it
nevertheless
my
adviser
asked
me
if
i
knew
who
gave
me
the
helmet
and
on
learning
that
i
did
he
intimated
that
he
would
like
to
know
the
man
s
name
i
preferred
however
not
to
tell
and
they
were
very
nice
about
that
too
i
shouldn
t
have
told
even
if
they
had
chosen
to
be
disagreeable
about
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
don
t
believe
any
action
will
be
taken
there
is
no
end
though
to
the
ominous
rumors
of
what
the
faculty
will
do
in
general
one
day
we
hear
that
the
two
lower
classes
won
t
be
allowed
to
play
football
this
year
and
the
next
that
all
the
freshmen
are
to
be
put
on
what
is
called
probation
everybody
in
an
indefinite
sort
of
way
is
very
indignant
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
see
why
but
as
all
the
rest
are
i
am
too
berrisford
has
been
very
nice
ever
since
that
monday
night
at
first
i
think
it
was
a
desire
to
make
amends
that
caused
him
to
spend
so
much
time
in
my
room
and
ask
me
to
do
so
many
things
with
him
and
his
friends
but
of
course
he
never
put
it
that
way
he
was
very
much
worried
when
i
told
him
that
my
adviser
and
the
regent
had
tried
to
find
out
who
had
given
me
the
helmet
and
he
wanted
to
rush
and
confess
it
took
me
a
good
while
to
persuade
him
not
to
in
fact
i
did
n
t
persuade
him
exactly
but
only
got
him
to
agree
at
length
to
let
duggie
decide
duggie
thought
the
matter
over
for
a
moment
and
said
that
as
my
refusal
to
tell
hadn
t
so
far
as
he
could
see
made
me
a
martyr
on
the
altar
of
friendship
he
thought
it
would
be
unnecessarily
theatrical
for
berrisford
to
give
himself
up
one
day
berrisford
asked
me
where
i
ate
and
when
i
told
him
i
had
been
trying
the
places
in
and
about
the
square
he
said
why
you
silly
don
t
you
join
my
crowd
at
mrs
brown
s
he
spoke
as
if
the
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
but
that
same
morning
when
he
introduced
me
to
a
man
who
came
up
to
his
room
the
fellow
said
i
hear
you
re
coming
to
our
table
that
s
good
so
it
must
have
all
been
arranged
beforehand
berrisford
s
awfully
generous
and
impulsive
and
kind
only
he
s
so
and
eccentric
you
never
know
what
he
s
going
to
do
next
i
ve
done
no
end
of
interesting
things
since
i
last
wrote
in
my
diary
i
bought
a
song
called
love
s
sorrow
at
a
music
store
had
the
man
play
it
for
me
five
or
six
times
learned
the
words
and
then
attempted
to
sing
it
at
the
trial
of
glee
club
candidates
i
m
sure
i
sang
all
the
notes
and
i
remembered
the
words
without
a
mistake
but
something
was
wrong
for
after
i
stopped
singing
the
fellow
at
the
piano
went
on
playing
the
accompaniment
several
minutes
and
when
i
took
my
seat
i
heard
one
of
the
judges
murmur
as
he
wrote
something
on
a
slip
of
paper
fourth
heat
tommy
trusting
shows
heels
to
the
bunch
and
wins
in
a
canter
they
told
me
i
would
see
my
name
in
the
crimson
when
they
wanted
me
for
rehearsal
it
hasn
t
appeared
yet
and
that
was
some
time
ago
then
one
morning
i
borrowed
a
jersey
and
some
moleskins
from
a
fellow
at
our
table
and
went
over
to
soldiers
field
to
try
for
the
football
team
first
we
lined
up
for
short
sprints
of
twenty
yards
or
so
then
they
divided
us
into
squads
and
made
us
practise
falling
on
the
ball
i
found
chloroform
liniment
very
good
for
this
but
berrisford
maintains
that
there
s
nothing
like
osteopathy
afterward
we
practised
place
kicks
drop
kicks
and
punts
candidates
for
tackle
were
lined
up
against
one
another
and
tried
breaking
through
and
practised
passing
and
snapping
back
the
ball
i
tried
the
dummy
the
dummy
is
an
imitation
man
in
football
clothes
suspended
by
pulley
from
a
wire
stretched
between
posts
or
thirty
feet
apart
it
is
weighted
by
sand
in
a
bag
that
is
supposed
to
slide
up
toward
the
pulley
as
you
tackle
the
thing
and
grind
its
nose
in
the
dirt
only
it
does
n
t
what
actually
happens
is
that
some
one
pulls
the
dummy
rapidly
from
one
post
to
the
other
and
while
the
creature
is
spinning
through
the
air
you
hurl
yourself
at
it
cling
to
it
desperately
with
your
and
teeth
for
about
the
tenth
of
a
second
and
are
then
flicked
a
drop
of
water
from
a
the
next
lot
when
you
return
the
coach
says
he
thinks
that
will
do
for
this
morning
and
enrolls
your
name
in
squad
the
members
of
this
s
the
told
to
report
for
practice
when
they
see
their
names
in
the
crimson
all
the
others
have
been
out
every
day
or
so
but
although
i
ve
read
the
crimson
carefully
every
morning
i
haven
t
seen
squad
h
notified
once
i
ve
got
so
that
i
don
t
have
to
look
at
the
printed
schedule
any
more
to
see
the
days
and
hours
of
my
various
lectures
i
just
go
to
the
right
one
when
the
bell
rings
as
if
i
had
been
doing
it
all
my
life
in
fact
the
college
world
has
settled
down
to
a
routine
of
lectures
and
recitations
pleasantly
broken
by
football
games
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
dining
in
town
now
and
then
and
the
theatre
afterward
come
to
think
of
it
i
ve
been
to
the
theatre
rather
oftener
than
now
and
then
at
home
there
are
only
two
and
the
things
we
have
once
in
a
long
pretty
fierce
but
here
there
are
about
seven
or
eight
big
ones
and
all
sorts
of
continuous
performance
places
dime
museums
and
nickelodeons
besides
you
simply
have
to
go
pretty
often
or
you
miss
something
good
that
everybody
s
talking
about
berrisford
goes
every
night
i
know
now
what
duggie
meant
when
he
said
my
allowance
would
not
be
big
enough
he
said
it
was
generous
there
however
i
disagree
with
him
i
m
not
in
the
extravagant
but
papa
does
n
t
seem
to
appreciate
how
many
unexpected
things
happen
that
cost
money
there
was
my
new
overcoat
for
instance
berrisford
was
having
one
made
and
i
realized
when
i
saw
him
trying
it
on
at
the
tailor
s
it
s
a
great
soft
loose
thing
the
kind
all
the
fellows
are
wearing
now
that
my
old
one
wouldn
t
do
at
all
in
fact
i
had
n
t
cared
to
put
mine
on
although
the
wind
has
been
pretty
sharp
once
or
twice
on
the
way
home
from
town
late
at
night
the
tailor
said
that
now
was
the
time
to
get
a
coat
like
berrisford
s
as
it
would
be
much
more
expensive
later
in
the
season
so
i
ordered
one
in
a
certain
way
it
was
real
economy
to
do
so
then
i
ve
gone
to
town
in
the
afternoon
several
times
with
some
of
the
fellows
who
are
at
our
table
and
stayed
at
the
last
moment
to
dinner
and
the
theatre
i
did
n
t
have
enough
money
with
me
to
do
all
this
and
was
n
t
going
to
at
first
but
i
found
that
the
others
did
n
t
either
and
expected
to
charge
their
dinners
at
the
hotel
you
can
even
charge
theatre
tickets
if
you
get
them
from
an
agent
and
pay
fifty
cents
more
it
s
very
convenient
i
bought
a
few
pictures
for
my
looked
so
bare
berrisford
has
all
sorts
of
queer
interesting
prints
and
embroideries
on
his
walls
that
he
brought
back
from
abroad
and
i
simply
had
to
get
some
more
chairs
for
i
had
only
one
the
whirligig
in
front
of
the
desk
doesn
t
count
it
s
too
uncomfortable
which
made
it
embarrassing
when
four
or
five
men
dropped
in
then
i
had
a
dozen
shirts
made
at
a
place
just
off
tremont
street
the
shirts
mamma
got
me
at
home
are
very
nice
and
all
that
but
they
re
not
the
kind
the
fellows
are
wearing
here
everybody
has
colored
pinks
and
blues
or
white
with
a
little
stripe
of
something
running
through
them
mine
were
all
white
i
really
did
n
t
need
more
than
six
new
ones
i
suppose
but
the
man
said
they
were
cheaper
by
the
dozen
he
showed
me
some
really
beautiful
neckties
that
had
arrived
that
day
from
london
against
the
materials
i
had
picked
out
for
the
shirts
they
were
stunning
and
as
they
weren
t
the
duty
the
originality
of
the
designs
and
the
heavy
silks
they
were
made
let
him
send
me
five
of
them
there
were
the
prettiest
old
pair
of
brass
andirons
and
a
fender
in
the
window
of
an
antique
shop
on
beacon
street
that
i
used
to
stop
and
covet
whenever
i
went
into
town
they
were
just
the
things
for
my
fireplace
which
looked
rather
comfortable
i
didn
t
think
i
could
afford
them
at
first
but
one
day
when
i
happened
to
be
passing
everything
in
the
window
was
for
sale
at
a
discount
of
ten
per
cent
the
man
was
very
kind
and
obliging
and
let
me
charge
them
they
let
you
do
that
at
all
the
shops
it
seems
but
i
do
think
they
might
have
a
little
more
decency
about
sending
in
their
bills
the
first
of
november
is
three
days
yet
i
ve
heard
from
every
cent
i
ve
spent
i
don
t
quite
know
what
to
do
about
it
as
my
when
it
t
be
nearly
enough
to
pay
for
everything
and
of
course
i
ll
have
to
keep
some
of
it
for
my
board
and
washing
and
schoolbooks
and
all
the
other
little
expenses
one
can
t
very
well
steer
clear
of
before
going
to
bed
the
last
two
nights
i
ve
spent
an
hour
or
more
in
itemizing
everything
and
adding
it
all
up
and
then
checking
off
the
people
who
have
to
be
paid
immediately
the
ones
who
could
wait
a
short
time
and
the
ones
about
whom
there
is
no
particular
hurry
this
makes
the
financial
outlook
a
little
more
possible
but
not
much
and
yet
duggie
had
the
to
say
he
thought
my
allowance
another
matter
that
i
try
not
to
think
of
is
the
fact
that
very
soon
we
are
to
be
given
what
is
called
hour
examinations
in
all
our
studies
i
never
imagined
they
would
come
abruptly
when
we
began
it
seemed
as
if
we
would
take
much
longer
to
learn
enough
to
be
examined
in
to
tell
the
the
exception
of
my
english
haven
t
become
deeply
interested
as
yet
in
the
lectures
after
the
first
few
times
i
gave
up
trying
to
take
notes
everything
i
wrote
seemed
so
unimportant
and
i
haven
t
done
any
of
the
reading
either
they
expect
you
to
do
a
lot
of
reading
at
home
or
in
the
library
and
hold
you
responsible
for
it
in
the
examination
the
man
berrisford
and
i
have
in
history
is
a
dreamy
old
thing
who
goes
into
thoughtful
trances
every
now
and
then
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
while
three
hundred
and
fifty
stylographic
pens
hang
in
waiting
to
harpoon
the
next
word
one
day
after
telling
us
to
read
a
certain
work
on
the
feudal
system
he
added
in
a
kind
of
vague
helpless
way
we
haven
t
the
book
in
the
library
and
i
believe
it
is
out
of
print
so
i
don
t
think
you
will
be
able
to
buy
it
anywhere
but
it
s
a
singularly
perfect
exposition
of
the
subject
and
i
strongly
advise
you
all
to
read
it
they
say
he
knows
more
about
in
the
thirteenth
century
than
any
other
living
person
except
one
dreadfully
old
man
in
germany
who
s
beginning
to
forget
about
it
we
were
instructed
to
make
ourselves
familiar
with
another
work
that
is
in
the
library
and
told
that
without
a
knowledge
of
it
we
could
not
expect
to
accomplish
much
in
the
examination
i
don
t
suppose
many
of
you
will
read
every
word
of
it
the
old
man
said
although
it
will
do
you
a
vast
amount
of
good
if
you
do
i
privately
made
up
my
mind
to
plough
through
the
whole
if
it
were
in
two
volumes
i
thought
it
would
please
him
so
the
other
day
as
it
was
raining
and
there
was
n
t
anything
in
particular
going
on
berrisford
suggested
that
we
run
over
to
the
library
and
glance
through
the
book
we
d
never
been
in
the
library
before
and
had
to
ask
one
of
the
pages
at
the
delivery
desk
where
the
history
alcove
was
he
couldn
t
attend
to
us
at
first
as
there
was
an
angry
old
gentleman
with
a
very
red
face
prancing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
desk
exclaiming
it
s
an
outrage
i
shall
certainly
speak
to
the
president
about
this
before
the
sun
goes
down
upon
my
wrath
several
other
pages
were
cowering
behind
the
desk
and
a
terrified
librarian
was
murmuring
i
can
have
it
here
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
first
thing
can
you
wait
that
long
but
i
want
it
the
old
gentleman
declared
i
shall
wait
until
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
you
re
preposterous
it
s
an
outrage
he
was
so
emphatic
and
peevish
that
some
of
the
students
in
the
big
pushed
open
the
swinging
doors
and
stuck
their
heads
in
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
well
berrisford
and
i
found
out
from
the
page
that
he
is
the
greatest
philosopher
of
modern
times
he
had
come
in
to
get
a
book
that
hadn
t
been
asked
for
in
fourteen
years
and
had
just
learned
that
it
had
been
carted
away
to
the
crypt
of
appleton
chapel
to
make
room
for
something
that
seemed
to
be
rather
more
universal
in
its
appeal
the
page
took
us
to
the
alcove
we
were
looking
for
and
berrisford
found
our
book
almost
immediately
my
back
was
toward
him
when
he
discovered
it
and
i
turned
around
only
because
of
his
unusual
and
prolonged
silence
he
was
standing
petrified
in
front
of
eighteen
fat
volumes
with
his
big
eyes
blinking
like
an
owl
confronted
by
a
dazzling
light
is
that
it
i
inquired
after
a
moment
in
a
cold
hushed
voice
by
way
of
answer
he
merely
rolled
his
eyes
and
swallowed
as
if
his
throat
were
dry
it
s
a
masterly
little
t
it
he
at
length
managed
to
say
then
without
further
comment
we
removed
the
volumes
from
the
shelf
and
piled
them
on
a
table
in
the
alcove
they
almost
covered
it
when
we
had
finished
berrisford
with
a
grim
look
about
his
under
lip
opened
one
of
them
and
began
to
read
i
did
the
same
it
was
just
three
o
clock
we
read
for
an
hour
without
speaking
or
looking
at
each
other
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
berrisford
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
make
calculations
on
the
back
of
a
letter
at
last
he
looked
up
as
if
to
demand
my
attention
i
have
read
this
book
and
an
hour
he
said
he
was
deliberate
and
there
was
an
air
of
finality
in
his
tone
i
find
that
i
have
completed
five
meaning
of
which
has
since
escaped
me
now
as
there
are
four
hundred
pages
in
this
volume
and
as
many
presumably
in
every
one
of
the
other
seventeen
it
will
take
me
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
forty
days
or
two
familiarize
myself
with
the
whole
set
if
we
sit
here
night
and
day
for
the
next
two
months
without
taking
a
second
off
to
eat
sleep
or
bathe
we
shall
have
glanced
through
this
superficial
pamphlet
and
pleased
the
old
man
i
think
it
has
stopped
raining
i
replied
we
have
a
new
inmate
at
our
house
i
woke
up
one
morning
hearing
such
a
strange
wild
sad
little
song
coming
from
my
study
at
first
i
thought
i
must
have
dreamed
it
but
even
after
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
knew
i
was
awake
the
sound
continued
it
was
the
queerest
most
barbaric
little
refrain
all
in
a
minor
key
with
words
i
could
n
t
make
out
and
was
the
sort
of
thing
one
could
imagine
a
native
of
some
kind
crooning
to
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
i
listened
to
it
afraid
to
go
in
but
when
it
began
to
grow
louder
and
then
was
interrupted
from
time
to
time
by
the
most
horrible
gurgling
and
strangling
noises
i
jumped
up
and
opened
my
study
door
at
the
same
moment
berrisford
and
chester
appeared
at
the
other
door
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
bristling
brown
thing
with
pointed
ears
and
muzzle
and
shrewd
little
eyes
it
had
absurdly
big
feet
and
looked
like
a
baby
wolf
something
that
seemed
to
be
a
piece
of
leather
was
dangling
from
its
mouth
berrisford
threw
himself
on
the
floor
exclaiming
my
is
to
me
and
pulled
gently
at
the
piece
of
leather
the
brute
rolled
his
eyes
gagged
a
little
and
let
him
have
it
why
it
s
the
thumb
of
a
glove
berrisford
said
holding
up
his
prize
for
us
to
look
at
and
he
dess
tould
n
t
eat
it
tause
it
had
a
nassy
tin
button
wivetted
on
uzzer
end
so
he
tould
n
t
he
added
to
the
animal
that
doesn
t
seem
to
have
stood
in
the
way
of
his
eating
the
other
one
i
remarked
coldly
for
there
was
enough
of
the
chewed
thing
in
berrisford
s
hand
to
enable
me
to
identify
the
remains
of
a
pair
of
very
expensive
gloves
i
had
bought
two
days
before
heavens
you
suppose
he
really
did
berrisford
asked
in
great
alarm
do
you
think
it
will
hurt
him
of
course
he
ate
it
i
don
t
see
it
anywhere
and
they
were
both
together
on
that
chair
i
hope
it
hurt
him
i
said
it
is
n
t
like
you
wood
to
talk
that
way
about
a
poor
lonely
foreign
thing
who
s
never
been
in
a
house
before
in
all
his
life
berrisford
muttered
resentfully
well
he
certainly
do
make
the
most
outlandish
sounds
chester
interposed
it
isn
t
s
icelandic
berrisford
replied
he
came
all
the
way
from
reikiavik
on
a
gloucester
i
bought
him
at
gloucester
yesterday
for
a
t
i
my
booful
saga
ess
he
did
and
he
dess
chewed
all
de
checks
often
de
trunks
in
dat
nassy
old
baggage
car
on
de
way
t
he
darlin
and
dat
horrid
baggage
man
was
dess
crazy
tause
he
did
n
t
know
where
to
put
off
any
baggage
and
had
to
delay
de
twain
like
evvysing
berrisford
became
quite
incoherent
after
this
so
i
returned
to
my
bedroom
and
slammed
the
door
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
for
any
one
man
to
inflict
a
whole
community
with
a
beast
like
saga
and
i
ve
told
berrisford
so
several
times
but
he
always
says
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
suffer
as
much
if
not
more
than
any
one
do
you
ever
hear
complain
when
he
wallows
in
the
mud
and
then
snuggles
up
in
bed
was
there
any
outcry
when
he
ate
gloves
and
patent
leather
shoes
and
russia
leather
notebook
with
hundreds
of
exhaustive
priceless
notes
on
the
first
part
of
paradise
lost
did
i
make
a
violent
way
you
and
duggie
do
every
i
gave
the
tea
for
my
sister
and
found
him
just
before
the
people
the
bathtub
in
a
state
of
coma
from
having
eaten
perfectly
lettuce
sandwiches
you
might
at
least
admit
that
you
think
he
s
just
as
distinguished
and
as
he
can
be
because
of
course
you
do
think
so
you
know
you
love
him
to
follow
you
through
the
everybody
turning
to
know
you
do
does
n
t
he
mon
bébé
mon
chien
de
one
of
the
fellows
at
the
table
invited
us
to
dine
at
his
house
in
town
last
sunday
evening
berrisford
was
to
meet
me
at
a
hotel
in
the
back
bay
at
a
quarter
past
seven
and
we
were
to
go
together
i
took
a
long
walk
that
afternoon
and
the
air
was
so
delicious
and
the
autumn
foliage
in
the
country
so
beautiful
that
i
didn
t
realize
how
late
it
was
until
i
looked
at
a
clock
in
a
jeweller
s
window
on
the
way
back
i
hurried
to
my
room
to
dress
and
as
i
opened
the
front
door
my
heart
suddenly
upstairs
i
heard
saga
chanting
his
terrible
little
refrain
we
have
all
come
to
dread
that
sound
at
our
house
for
it
invariably
means
the
loss
of
a
cherished
object
to
somebody
berrisford
calls
it
the
icelandic
hunger
and
death
motif
i
ran
upstairs
and
found
saga
eating
one
of
the
tails
of
my
which
i
had
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
in
my
study
to
get
the
creases
out
he
had
apparently
first
torn
it
off
then
divided
it
into
small
pieces
and
was
consuming
them
one
by
one
as
i
came
in
i
was
already
late
for
dinner
and
as
it
was
sunday
evening
there
was
no
one
in
town
from
whom
i
could
borrow
another
coat
for
a
moment
i
could
n
t
decide
whether
to
sit
down
and
cry
or
to
commit
sagacide
of
course
i
went
to
the
what
is
more
i
arrived
almost
on
time
i
can
t
give
myself
any
particular
credit
for
this
achievement
however
as
it
was
luck
pure
and
simple
that
got
me
there
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
i
am
marvellously
lucky
i
seem
to
have
a
knack
of
falling
on
my
feet
and
although
duggie
has
taken
to
worrying
about
my
shiftlessness
as
he
is
pleased
to
call
it
in
money
matters
and
the
calmness
with
which
i
regard
the
approaching
examinations
and
the
academic
side
of
college
in
general
i
have
a
feeling
that
everything
will
come
out
all
right
somehow
it
would
sound
heartless
i
suppose
to
speak
as
if
i
thought
it
fortunate
that
jerry
brooks
had
been
stricken
with
appendicitis
just
in
time
to
get
me
into
the
dinner
if
it
were
n
t
for
the
fact
that
he
is
recovering
so
splendidly
i
went
up
to
the
hospital
this
afternoon
to
inquire
but
under
the
circumstances
it
is
hard
not
to
look
upon
his
sudden
seizure
rather
i
know
he
will
enjoy
hearing
about
it
when
he
is
well
enough
to
see
people
i
was
in
despair
that
evening
when
his
roommate
came
clattering
up
our
tin
steps
and
pounded
on
berrisford
s
door
but
the
instant
i
ran
into
the
hall
and
saw
him
my
heart
gave
a
great
throb
of
hope
he
had
his
dress
clothes
on
but
he
didn
t
look
in
the
least
like
a
person
on
the
way
to
dine
in
i
felt
with
indescribable
relief
that
if
this
were
the
case
i
could
have
his
coat
isn
t
berrisford
here
has
he
gone
he
exclaimed
excitedly
i
had
never
seen
him
i
knew
his
chum
brooks
slightly
we
were
going
to
dine
at
the
same
house
in
town
but
my
roommate
jerry
brooks
got
sick
just
as
i
was
starting
and
i
can
t
go
and
two
doctors
have
taken
him
up
to
the
hospital
and
the
hemingtons
haven
t
a
telephone
and
i
thought
i
d
let
berrisford
know
for
of
well
his
coat
didn
t
fit
me
in
a
way
to
make
a
tailor
expire
with
envy
exactly
but
i
was
mighty
glad
to
get
anyhow
i
think
people
are
inclined
to
take
a
for
granted
berrisford
attached
no
importance
whatever
to
the
fact
that
his
beast
had
ruined
my
coat
but
merely
said
reproachfully
i
hope
you
let
him
have
the
pieces
to
play
with
he
ll
be
so
lonely
this
evening
with
no
one
in
the
house
except
mrs
chester
i
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
of
late
duggie
has
given
intimations
of
having
me
on
his
mind
of
course
when
a
man
like
duggie
finds
time
to
care
one
way
or
the
other
about
what
he
thinks
you
ought
to
do
it
s
a
great
honor
he
is
the
busiest
hardest
worked
and
most
influential
person
i
ever
knew
he
belongs
to
no
end
of
clubs
and
besides
being
captain
of
the
team
he
s
at
the
head
of
a
lot
of
other
college
things
almost
every
day
there
s
a
reporter
or
two
lying
in
wait
for
him
out
here
to
ask
about
the
team
and
whether
he
approves
of
the
athletic
committee
s
latest
mandate
and
what
he
thinks
about
all
sorts
of
things
in
regard
to
which
he
hasn
t
any
opinion
would
n
t
express
it
even
if
he
had
besides
all
this
he
manages
in
some
way
to
study
awfully
hard
and
to
get
high
marks
in
everything
he
takes
furthermore
he
s
in
training
most
of
the
year
and
just
now
he
has
to
go
to
bed
every
night
except
saturday
at
nine
or
ten
he
s
almost
always
amiable
and
kind
to
people
and
i
think
he
s
great
i
can
t
help
liking
the
fact
that
he
drops
into
my
room
and
sits
down
and
talks
the
way
he
does
some
of
the
fellows
at
our
table
found
him
there
the
other
day
and
were
scared
to
death
but
at
the
same
time
i
have
a
feeling
that
he
does
n
t
think
berrisford
and
i
are
just
what
we
ought
to
be
as
if
people
could
be
different
from
the
way
they
re
made
i
know
that
sometimes
he
would
like
to
say
things
that
after
all
he
never
quite
does
of
berrisford
i
m
sure
he
doesn
t
approve
at
all
i
don
t
of
course
believe
for
a
moment
that
he
was
anything
but
amused
at
the
way
berrisford
conjugated
the
french
verb
for
him
the
other
day
but
as
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
berri
takes
an
uncontrollable
joy
in
doing
i
think
duggie
has
an
idea
that
he
is
n
t
good
for
anything
else
can
t
imagine
never
studied
french
until
this
year
he
enrolled
in
a
class
only
a
week
or
so
ago
and
though
it
s
merely
an
extra
course
with
him
and
he
could
get
his
degree
just
as
easily
without
it
he
goes
at
it
as
if
it
were
berrisford
knows
french
as
well
as
he
knows
english
and
volunteered
to
help
him
with
his
exercises
the
other
afternoon
duggie
ran
into
berri
s
room
and
said
i
ve
an
idea
that
we
re
going
to
have
suis
in
french
i
wish
you
would
write
out
a
few
tenses
for
me
so
i
can
learn
them
on
the
way
simply
have
n
t
had
a
minute
to
myself
for
two
days
naturally
berrisford
seemed
delighted
to
help
him
and
gravely
wrote
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
duggie
carried
off
just
as
the
bell
was
ringing
when
he
got
into
the
yard
and
slowed
up
to
look
at
it
this
is
what
he
found
suis
es
est
sommes
êtes
sont
of
course
he
did
n
t
actually
care
but
i
don
t
think
the
incident
helped
in
duggie
s
opinion
to
throw
any
very
dazzling
light
on
berrisford
s
really
serious
qualities
duggie
regarded
it
i
m
sure
as
about
on
a
par
with
the
way
we
get
out
of
sitting
through
our
history
lecture
one
day
when
the
dreamy
old
gentleman
who
conducts
the
history
course
was
trying
to
prove
that
charlemagne
either
was
or
was
n
t
surprised
i
ve
forgotten
which
when
the
pope
suddenly
produced
a
crown
and
stuck
it
on
his
head
a
ripple
of
mirth
swept
gently
across
the
room
very
much
as
a
light
breeze
ruffles
the
surface
of
a
wheatfield
no
one
laughed
out
loud
but
when
between
three
and
four
hundred
men
all
smile
at
once
it
makes
a
curious
little
disturbance
i
can
t
quite
describe
the
old
gentleman
looked
up
from
his
notes
took
off
his
spectacles
chose
one
of
the
other
pairs
lying
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
he
has
three
or
four
kinds
that
he
uses
for
different
distances
and
inspected
the
room
but
by
the
time
he
had
got
himself
properly
focused
there
was
nothing
to
see
the
fellow
who
had
made
every
one
giggle
by
climbing
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
was
probably
a
block
away
so
after
a
troubled
inquiring
look
from
side
to
side
the
dear
old
man
changed
his
spectacles
again
and
went
on
with
the
lecture
now
although
it
had
never
occurred
to
any
one
to
crawl
down
the
until
that
day
every
one
in
our
part
of
the
room
has
become
infatuated
with
the
idea
and
three
times
a
after
is
a
continuous
stream
of
men
backing
out
the
window
down
the
iron
ladder
and
into
the
yard
in
fact
the
struggle
to
escape
became
so
universal
and
there
were
so
many
scraps
at
the
window
and
in
on
the
way
down
over
who
should
go
first
that
berrisford
evolved
the
idea
of
distributing
numbers
the
way
they
do
in
barbershops
on
saturday
afternoon
when
everybody
in
the
world
becomes
inspired
with
the
desire
to
be
shaved
at
the
same
time
it
works
beautifully
but
of
late
the
undertaking
is
attended
by
considerable
risk
at
first
professor
kinde
stopped
lecturing
and
fumbled
for
his
other
spectacles
only
when
he
heard
the
class
titter
i
don
t
believe
he
in
the
least
knew
what
was
going
on
but
recently
he
has
become
extremely
foxy
although
he
has
n
t
spoken
of
the
matter
he
realizes
what
is
happening
and
i
think
the
ambition
of
his
declining
years
is
to
catch
somebody
in
the
act
of
darting
toward
the
window
at
irregular
intervals
now
throughout
his
lectures
of
his
notes
seizes
a
fresh
pair
of
spectacles
makes
a
lightning
change
and
then
peeks
craftily
about
the
room
while
the
class
tries
hard
not
to
hurt
his
feelings
by
laughing
then
disappointed
but
with
an
air
of
i
he
changes
back
again
and
continues
the
lectures
have
become
so
exciting
and
fragmentary
that
berrisford
and
i
are
torn
with
the
conflicting
desires
to
stay
and
see
what
happens
and
to
get
out
into
the
wonderful
autumn
weather
usually
however
we
leave
and
the
last
time
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
drop
to
the
ground
duggie
strode
in
sight
berrisford
down
happened
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
when
he
saw
duggie
he
swung
around
struck
an
alexandre
dumas
attitude
and
exclaimed
dramatically
sire
we
have
liberated
the
prisoners
cut
away
the
portcullis
and
fired
the
powder
magazine
is
t
well
duggie
laughed
powder
magazines
aren
t
the
only
things
that
get
fired
around
these
parts
monsieur
he
answered
as
he
passed
on
now
there
was
nothing
disagreeable
either
in
the
remark
or
the
way
duggie
made
it
he
seemed
perfectly
and
although
in
a
great
hurry
very
much
amused
but
somehow
it
was
n
t
quite
as
if
any
one
else
had
said
it
i
don
t
know
what
reading
between
the
lines
is
called
when
there
aren
t
any
lines
to
read
between
but
anyhow
that
s
what
i
couldn
t
help
doing
duggie
s
little
thrust
was
made
at
it
was
intended
for
me
and
that
s
what
i
mean
when
i
say
duggie
has
me
on
his
mind
he
would
have
berri
there
too
if
he
liked
him
but
he
does
n
t
i
think
he
firmly
believes
that
he
regards
us
both
with
the
utmost
impartiality
yet
i
know
this
is
recorded
in
all
modesty
merely
as
a
fact
that
he
likes
me
and
that
for
poor
berri
he
has
no
use
at
all
berrisford
is
tactless
he
had
no
business
for
instance
to
tell
duggie
about
the
watch
one
saturday
morning
when
berrisford
had
finished
his
lectures
for
the
day
and
i
found
that
a
cut
was
to
be
given
in
my
last
one
we
strolled
along
massachusetts
avenue
without
really
meaning
to
go
anywhere
until
we
came
to
the
bridge
across
the
back
bay
we
leaned
over
the
rail
awhile
and
watched
the
tide
clutching
viciously
at
the
piers
as
it
swirled
out
and
then
farther
up
i
noticed
a
flock
of
ducks
paddling
about
in
a
most
delightful
little
left
by
the
falling
tide
i
could
hit
one
of
those
birdies
if
i
had
a
shotgun
i
said
closing
one
eye
it
just
shows
what
a
trivial
remark
may
sometimes
lead
one
into
it
wouldn
t
do
you
any
good
berrisford
yawned
you
couldn
t
get
it
i
don
t
see
why
not
i
could
borrow
a
boat
from
the
humane
society
and
row
out
i
answered
rather
irritated
by
berrisford
s
languid
scepticism
well
what
on
earth
would
you
do
with
the
poor
little
beast
after
you
did
get
him
he
pursued
what
do
you
suppose
i
exclaimed
what
do
people
usually
do
when
they
shoot
a
duck
i
think
they
usually
say
that
they
really
hit
two
but
that
the
other
one
managed
to
crawl
into
a
dense
patch
of
wild
rice
growing
near
by
berrisford
answered
i
should
have
it
cooked
and
then
i
d
eat
it
i
said
ignoring
his
remark
what
an
extremely
piggish
performance
there
would
not
be
enough
for
any
one
but
yourself
i
would
much
rather
go
into
town
with
somebody
and
have
one
apiece
at
the
touraine
oh
berrisford
i
murmured
this
is
so
sudden
when
we
reached
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
we
got
on
a
passing
car
and
after
we
sat
down
berrisford
said
you
ll
have
to
pay
for
me
i
have
n
t
any
money
either
here
or
in
cambridge
as
i
had
just
eight
cents
in
the
world
and
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
berri
was
going
to
pay
for
me
we
jumped
out
before
the
conductor
came
around
and
resumed
our
walk
if
you
have
n
t
any
money
and
i
haven
t
any
money
i
m
inclined
to
think
the
ducks
will
not
fly
well
i
mused
for
the
last
time
we
had
been
to
the
touraine
the
head
most
tiresome
me
we
could
n
t
charge
anything
more
there
until
we
paid
our
bills
i
suppose
you
would
just
sit
on
the
curbstone
and
starve
berrisford
sniffed
and
as
we
walked
along
i
saw
that
he
had
some
kind
of
a
plan
he
took
me
through
one
of
the
queer
little
alleys
with
which
boston
is
honeycombed
and
out
into
a
noisy
narrow
street
lined
with
shabby
stores
and
snuffy
restaurants
kind
that
have
red
tablecloths
at
first
i
thought
it
was
berri
s
intention
to
get
luncheon
in
one
of
these
places
although
i
did
n
t
see
how
even
he
could
manage
it
very
well
on
eight
cents
however
i
asked
no
questions
suddenly
he
stopped
and
took
off
his
then
we
walked
on
a
few
steps
and
went
into
a
pawnbroker
s
it
sounds
absurd
but
when
i
discovered
what
berrisford
was
about
to
do
i
felt
curiously
excited
and
embarrassed
of
course
i
knew
that
lots
of
people
pawn
things
but
i
had
never
seen
it
done
before
and
like
most
of
the
things
you
can
think
about
and
read
about
in
cold
blood
i
found
that
it
made
my
heart
beat
a
good
deal
faster
actually
to
do
it
in
fact
i
did
n
t
care
to
do
it
at
all
and
told
berrisford
so
in
an
undertone
but
he
said
why
not
there
s
nothing
wrong
in
it
you
own
something
more
or
less
valuable
and
you
happen
for
the
moment
to
need
something
else
why
should
n
t
you
exchange
them
if
the
soiled
vampire
who
runs
this
place
what
s
become
of
him
anyhow
would
give
me
two
small
roasted
ducks
and
some
bread
and
butter
and
currant
jelly
and
two
little
cups
of
coffee
and
a
waiter
to
serve
them
and
a
mediæval
banquet
hall
to
eat
them
in
and
a
perfectly
awful
orchestra
behind
a
thicket
of
imitation
to
play
hungarian
rhapsodies
while
we
of
five
dollars
and
a
half
i
should
be
just
as
well
pleased
because
it
will
amount
to
about
the
same
thing
in
the
end
just
then
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
emerged
from
behind
a
mound
of
trousers
and
overcoats
and
shuffled
toward
us
very
unwillingly
it
seemed
to
me
but
berrisford
said
he
was
always
like
that
you
can
t
expect
a
display
of
pleasing
emotions
for
a
paltry
five
per
cent
a
month
berrisford
whispered
in
my
ear
i
don
t
think
however
that
the
pawnbroker
could
have
looked
pleasant
no
matter
what
per
cent
he
got
he
took
berri
s
beautiful
they
re
made
of
four
antique
japanese
gold
pieces
went
into
a
sort
of
glass
cage
built
around
a
high
desk
and
a
safe
and
did
all
sorts
of
queer
things
to
them
he
scratched
the
under
side
of
two
of
the
coins
with
a
small
file
then
he
dabbed
some
kind
of
a
liquid
that
he
got
out
of
a
tiny
bottle
on
the
rough
places
and
examined
them
through
one
of
those
inane
spool
things
that
jewellers
hang
on
their
eyeballs
just
before
telling
you
that
you
ve
busted
your
mainspring
next
he
weighed
them
in
a
pair
of
scales
that
he
fished
out
of
a
drawer
in
the
desk
and
finally
he
held
up
his
claw
of
a
hand
with
all
the
fingers
distended
for
us
to
inspect
through
the
glass
why
you
dreadful
old
man
berrisford
exclaimed
indignantly
you
gave
me
five
and
a
half
last
time
i
wouldn
t
think
of
taking
less
for
a
moment
i
supposed
that
the
game
was
up
and
we
d
have
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
cambridge
and
be
too
late
for
luncheon
when
we
got
there
for
berrisford
took
his
and
strolled
over
to
the
door
saying
in
a
loud
voice
come
on
tommy
there
s
a
better
one
across
the
street
but
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
soiled
vampire
made
a
guttural
sound
that
berrisford
seemed
to
understand
and
we
went
back
and
got
the
amount
berri
considered
himself
entitled
to
the
quality
of
mercy
is
a
little
strained
this
morning
he
said
when
hirsch
went
into
the
glass
cage
again
to
make
out
the
ticket
i
always
had
an
idea
that
a
pawn
ticket
was
a
piece
of
blue
like
a
return
theatre
ticket
but
it
is
n
t
at
all
it
s
simply
a
thin
slip
of
paper
resembling
a
smaller
well
we
had
a
delightful
luncheon
after
luncheon
we
thought
of
going
to
the
matinée
and
sitting
in
the
gallery
but
berri
all
at
once
exclaimed
as
if
the
idea
were
a
sort
of
inspiration
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
ll
do
let
s
economize
i
ve
always
wanted
to
they
say
you
can
be
awfully
nice
and
contented
if
you
never
spend
a
cent
but
just
think
noble
thoughts
we
might
go
and
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
public
library
and
then
cross
over
to
the
art
museum
i
suggested
it
s
free
on
saturdays
you
know
berri
thought
that
would
be
charming
so
we
walked
up
boylston
street
stopping
at
a
florist
s
on
the
way
to
send
some
american
beauties
and
some
violets
to
hemington
at
whose
house
we
dined
that
sunday
night
she
was
thrown
out
of
a
carriage
the
other
day
and
sprained
her
thumb
and
we
thought
we
ought
to
take
some
notice
of
it
as
she
was
very
nice
about
asking
us
to
come
to
sunday
luncheon
whenever
we
wanted
to
berrisford
did
n
t
care
much
for
the
puvis
de
chavannes
pictures
in
the
library
is
after
he
found
out
that
they
were
as
finished
as
they
were
ever
going
to
be
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
think
them
rather
promising
and
said
that
by
the
time
they
got
the
second
and
third
coats
of
paint
on
they
would
no
doubt
do
very
nicely
but
the
artist
is
dead
i
explained
and
anyhow
he
always
painted
like
that
why
did
n
t
some
one
speak
to
him
about
it
said
berri
there
would
n
t
have
been
any
use
he
painted
that
way
on
purpose
it
was
his
individuality
i
said
do
you
like
it
he
suddenly
demanded
he
was
looking
at
me
very
intently
and
i
did
n
t
know
just
what
to
say
for
although
i
ve
gone
to
see
the
pictures
several
times
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
ask
myself
whether
i
really
liked
them
or
not
i
every
one
says
they
are
so
i
did
i
don
t
mean
do
you
know
how
much
they
cost
or
what
people
said
about
them
in
the
backs
of
magazines
when
they
were
first
put
up
what
i
want
to
know
does
looking
at
them
give
you
great
pleasure
i
think
they
re
simply
preposterous
i
said
and
then
we
went
outdoors
again
and
over
to
the
art
museum
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
there
sitting
in
front
of
a
painting
by
turner
called
the
slave
ship
and
listening
to
what
the
people
who
passed
by
said
about
it
i
did
n
t
think
there
was
very
much
to
s
merely
some
small
dark
brown
legs
in
a
storm
at
sea
with
a
fire
burning
but
the
people
who
came
to
look
at
it
murmured
all
sorts
of
things
in
low
sad
voices
and
several
of
them
read
long
extracts
from
a
book
that
berri
said
was
by
ruskin
when
i
asked
him
how
he
knew
he
answered
that
it
could
n
t
well
be
by
any
one
else
a
great
many
people
say
that
berri
s
a
fool
but
i
think
he
knows
an
awful
lot
it
makes
one
tired
and
hungry
to
criticise
pictures
all
afternoon
and
when
we
left
the
gallery
berri
sat
down
on
the
steps
and
said
he
could
never
walk
all
the
way
to
cambridge
in
his
exhausted
condition
so
once
more
we
found
ourselves
confronted
by
famine
now
if
mamma
were
only
here
i
know
i
could
explain
everything
to
her
and
she
would
n
t
think
me
so
lacking
in
respect
for
my
utterly
she
evidently
does
but
until
she
gets
my
letter
and
perhaps
even
afterward
she
will
be
unhappy
over
the
crude
unqualified
fact
that
i
pawned
my
watch
it
belonged
to
my
and
is
a
fine
old
thing
with
a
wreath
of
gold
and
platinum
roses
on
its
round
gold
face
i
got
dollars
on
it
nobody
but
berri
would
have
known
and
there
would
n
t
have
been
the
least
fuss
if
uncle
peter
had
n
t
come
to
town
he
was
in
boston
on
business
and
appeared
in
my
room
one
afternoon
a
few
days
afterward
i
was
ever
so
glad
to
see
somebody
from
home
and
i
introduced
him
to
berri
who
helped
me
show
him
the
gym
and
soldiers
field
and
the
glass
flowers
and
pretty
much
everything
open
to
visitors
he
had
a
lovely
time
and
asked
us
to
dinner
in
the
evening
we
had
a
pleasant
uncle
peter
kept
glancing
at
his
watch
every
few
minutes
he
was
leaving
on
an
early
train
finally
he
said
what
time
is
it
tommy
i
m
afraid
i
m
slow
from
force
of
habit
i
felt
for
my
watch
and
then
i
suppose
i
must
have
looked
queer
for
berrisford
began
to
chuckle
and
uncle
peter
after
a
moment
of
mystification
jumped
hastily
to
a
conclusion
that
i
am
sorry
to
say
happened
to
be
correct
he
rubbed
it
in
all
through
dinner
and
on
the
way
to
the
station
and
i
suppose
when
he
reached
home
he
told
mamma
the
first
thing
for
the
evening
of
the
day
he
arrived
i
got
a
telegram
from
mamma
that
said
redeem
watch
immediately
keep
this
from
your
father
it
would
kill
him
of
course
berri
had
to
elaborate
the
thing
in
his
best
style
and
keep
duggie
awake
for
half
an
hour
while
he
told
him
about
it
i
made
it
very
graphic
he
said
to
me
gloomily
but
somehow
or
other
it
didn
t
seem
to
take
the
crash
has
come
and
the
dean
and
my
adviser
two
or
three
instructors
some
of
the
fellows
at
the
table
and
even
berrisford
this
last
is
a
little
too
much
have
all
taken
occasion
to
inform
me
regretfully
that
they
foresaw
it
from
the
first
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
a
man
bitter
how
did
i
know
what
was
ahead
of
me
if
they
all
realized
so
well
that
i
was
going
to
flunk
the
hour
exams
why
did
n
t
they
let
me
know
then
it
might
have
done
some
good
if
they
had
told
me
three
weeks
ago
that
they
thought
me
stupid
but
i
fail
to
see
the
point
of
their
giving
me
to
understand
at
this
stage
of
the
game
that
they
themselves
all
along
have
been
so
awfully
clever
yet
that
s
just
what
they
ve
done
all
except
duggie
and
strangely
enough
it
was
duggie
that
i
most
dreaded
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
scarcely
mentioned
the
subject
when
i
went
into
his
room
one
night
and
stood
around
for
a
while
without
knowing
how
to
begin
and
finally
came
out
with
well
i
suppose
berri
s
told
you
that
i
didn
t
get
through
a
single
exam
merely
said
that
s
tough
luck
i
m
darned
sorry
and
then
after
a
moment
he
added
oh
well
there
ll
be
some
more
coming
along
in
february
it
is
n
t
as
if
they
were
n
t
going
to
let
you
have
another
whack
at
things
of
course
i
know
it
is
n
t
my
last
chance
i
answered
drearily
but
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
the
fact
of
its
being
my
first
makes
it
almost
as
bad
it
starts
me
all
wrong
in
the
opinion
of
the
dean
and
my
adviser
and
the
college
generally
somehow
i
could
n
t
bring
myself
to
tell
duggie
what
i
thought
and
what
in
a
measure
i
still
that
the
marks
i
got
were
most
unjust
there
s
something
about
don
t
know
what
it
is
always
makes
you
try
to
take
the
tone
when
you
re
telling
him
anything
that
you
feel
he
would
take
if
he
were
telling
the
same
thing
to
you
this
sounds
rather
complicated
but
what
i
mean
for
instance
is
that
if
he
got
e
in
all
his
exams
and
thought
the
instructors
had
been
unjust
he
would
probably
go
and
have
it
out
with
them
but
he
would
n
t
complain
to
any
one
else
of
course
it
s
simply
nonsense
even
to
pretend
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
duggie
could
flunk
in
anything
but
anyhow
that
s
what
i
mean
however
i
did
n
t
have
the
same
hesitation
in
saying
to
berrisford
that
i
considered
myself
pretty
badly
treated
i
know
of
course
that
i
didn
t
write
clever
papers
i
told
him
but
i
at
least
wrote
long
ones
they
ought
to
give
me
some
credit
for
that
enough
to
squeeze
through
on
anyhow
berri
agreed
with
me
perfectly
that
all
the
instructors
were
unjust
yet
at
the
same
time
he
said
with
a
peculiarly
irritating
judicial
manner
that
he
sometimes
assumes
when
you
least
expect
it
but
i
can
can
understand
it
s
most
it
s
very
natural
as
long
as
we
employ
this
primitive
inadequate
method
of
determining
the
amount
of
a
man
s
knowledge
we
must
expect
to
collide
every
now
and
then
with
the
personal
equation
this
sounded
like
a
new
superintendent
addressing
the
village
school
board
for
the
first
time
but
i
did
n
t
say
anything
as
i
knew
there
was
something
behind
it
that
berri
did
n
t
care
just
then
to
make
more
clear
berri
has
exceedingly
definite
ideas
about
things
but
he
aims
to
please
he
finds
it
hard
to
express
himself
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
everything
come
out
pleasantly
in
the
end
what
you
say
is
no
doubt
important
and
true
i
answered
but
i
don
t
know
what
it
means
why
i
simply
mean
that
in
thinking
the
matter
over
one
can
t
get
around
the
fact
that
ever
since
college
opened
you
ve
shall
i
say
people
have
been
more
aware
of
you
than
your
size
would
seem
to
justify
you
ve
been
as
it
were
a
cinder
in
the
public
eye
berrisford
stopped
abruptly
and
for
a
moment
looked
sort
of
aghast
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
he
exclaimed
more
in
his
natural
tone
i
had
n
t
any
idea
it
was
coming
out
that
way
that
s
the
trouble
with
metaphors
i
don
t
see
how
i
ve
been
more
of
a
cinder
than
any
one
you
ve
been
for
instance
i
objected
i
ve
seen
more
of
you
than
i
ve
seen
of
any
one
and
i
ve
been
seen
more
with
you
i
added
that
s
the
frightful
injustice
of
it
berrisford
put
in
triumphantly
that
s
what
i
m
trying
to
get
at
i
don
t
believe
he
was
at
all
but
i
let
him
continue
we
ve
always
done
about
the
same
fate
has
ordained
that
in
every
instance
you
were
to
leave
your
impress
upon
the
wax
of
hostile
opinion
while
i
was
as
the
house
of
sand
effaced
by
neptune
s
briny
hand
doesn
t
that
last
sound
exactly
like
pope
at
his
worst
you
see
you
got
yourself
arrested
at
the
very
beginning
of
things
of
course
socially
speaking
it
was
a
brilliant
move
it
simply
made
you
but
on
the
other
hand
i
don
t
think
it
helped
very
much
to
bring
you
thoroughly
in
touch
with
the
faculty
and
one
has
to
look
out
for
that
then
you
know
of
all
the
hundreds
that
swarmed
down
the
during
professor
kinde
s
lectures
you
were
the
only
one
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
caught
this
naturally
made
the
impossible
from
then
on
and
once
more
turned
the
garish
light
of
publicity
upon
you
and
to
cap
were
inspired
to
give
much
the
fine
arts
book
why
my
dear
child
your
name
is
a
household
word
the
incident
of
the
fine
arts
book
i
confess
was
enough
to
make
a
man
just
give
up
and
turn
cynical
much
is
a
boston
architect
who
comes
out
from
town
twice
a
week
to
lecture
on
ancient
art
they
think
a
great
deal
of
him
in
boston
he
stands
at
the
head
of
his
profession
there
because
as
he
s
never
built
anything
even
the
most
critical
have
no
grounds
for
complaint
berri
says
there
are
lots
of
people
like
that
in
boston
and
writers
and
musicians
who
are
really
very
great
but
think
it
more
refined
just
to
live
their
works
he
meets
them
at
his
aunt
s
house
where
they
often
gather
to
talk
it
all
over
well
at
the
first
lecture
much
told
us
to
buy
and
read
carefully
a
certain
treatise
on
ancient
art
and
always
bring
it
to
the
lectures
as
he
would
refer
to
it
frequently
i
acted
on
his
advice
to
the
extent
of
examining
the
book
in
the
store
one
day
but
it
was
large
and
heavy
and
the
illustrations
were
rather
and
it
cost
two
dollars
so
i
decided
i
could
get
along
without
it
most
of
the
fellows
did
the
same
thing
and
the
impulsive
few
who
actually
bought
it
got
tired
after
a
while
of
lugging
it
to
the
lectures
as
much
did
n
t
show
any
intention
of
ever
referring
to
it
one
morning
as
i
was
strolling
over
to
hear
him
tell
about
the
influence
of
greek
something
or
other
on
something
else
and
the
deplorable
decadence
it
had
undergone
later
at
the
hands
of
the
romans
hemington
darted
out
of
a
bookstore
in
the
square
and
said
if
you
re
going
to
fine
arts
just
take
this
book
and
give
it
to
bertie
stockbridge
bertie
is
his
roommate
i
m
going
to
cut
i
have
to
meet
my
father
in
town
i
took
the
book
and
pursued
my
way
now
that
morning
for
the
first
time
much
after
lecturing
for
about
half
an
hour
surprised
every
one
by
breaking
off
abruptly
and
saying
there
s
a
very
helpful
note
on
page
eighteen
of
geschmitzenmenger
s
ancient
art
that
i
wish
you
would
all
turn
to
then
after
a
moment
he
added
as
some
of
us
may
have
failed
to
bring
the
book
this
morning
i
think
i
shall
read
the
note
in
question
aloud
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
with
a
solicitous
smile
held
out
his
hand
but
no
one
in
the
front
row
had
a
book
to
lend
him
his
smile
changed
to
an
expression
of
mild
disgust
and
he
glanced
along
the
second
row
of
seats
no
one
responded
however
and
he
swept
the
room
with
a
look
of
annoyance
exclaiming
and
snapping
his
fingers
impatiently
just
then
the
fellow
next
to
me
murmured
will
any
lady
or
gentleman
in
the
audience
kindly
lend
me
a
high
hat
three
rabbits
and
a
dozen
fresh
eggs
and
i
laughed
and
as
i
laughed
i
leaned
over
to
hide
my
there
on
my
lap
was
geschmitzenmenger
s
ancient
art
after
hemington
had
given
it
to
me
i
was
so
interested
in
whether
he
would
catch
his
car
or
not
that
i
had
never
looked
at
it
at
all
is
it
possible
that
no
one
has
provided
himself
with
the
book
i
requested
you
to
procure
much
was
asking
incredulously
i
saw
my
chance
to
make
a
hit
and
after
a
moment
of
impressive
silence
i
arose
and
walked
to
the
platform
there
was
a
gust
of
dumfounded
laughter
followed
by
prolonged
applause
as
i
went
back
to
my
seat
all
the
fellows
who
could
reach
me
insisted
on
patting
me
on
the
back
and
grasping
me
by
the
hand
it
was
most
embarrassing
but
the
really
sickening
part
of
it
was
to
come
much
made
a
little
speech
about
me
saying
i
am
glad
that
there
is
at
least
one
and
when
he
had
finished
he
opened
the
book
with
a
flourish
and
found
as
was
quite
natural
that
none
of
the
leaves
had
been
cut
i
suppose
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
last
straw
for
he
simply
stood
there
a
minute
fingering
the
pages
helplessly
and
smiling
the
pitiful
philosophic
smile
of
one
who
has
lived
long
enough
to
have
had
even
his
most
conservative
illusions
dispelled
then
he
turned
the
book
around
and
held
it
open
for
every
one
to
howl
at
and
finally
he
dismissed
us
with
a
hopeless
gesture
that
expressed
the
unutterable
whereupon
i
was
seized
by
strong
willing
hands
and
borne
aloft
all
over
the
yard
followed
by
the
whole
class
hooting
and
jeering
it
was
this
that
led
berri
to
say
that
my
name
had
become
a
household
word
you
see
berri
went
on
when
an
instructor
reads
my
examination
book
for
instance
the
signature
of
the
writer
conveys
nothing
to
him
but
when
he
strikes
stops
and
exclaims
where
have
i
seen
that
name
before
then
he
sharpens
his
pencil
to
its
finest
possible
point
and
gives
you
but
you
do
agree
with
me
that
it
s
terribly
unjust
i
asked
him
for
that
after
all
seemed
to
be
the
main
thing
why
of
course
it
s
unjust
berrisford
answered
decidedly
it
s
one
of
the
worst
cases
that
has
ever
come
to
my
notice
it
did
n
t
occur
to
me
until
afterward
that
as
these
were
our
first
examinations
berrisford
s
notice
had
not
been
particularly
extensive
for
i
felt
so
badly
about
the
whole
thing
that
it
was
agreeable
to
know
that
an
intelligent
person
like
berrisford
believed
i
had
been
shabbily
treated
it
was
his
moral
support
i
think
that
gave
me
nerve
enough
to
complain
to
my
adviser
my
adviser
is
a
young
man
and
seems
like
an
appreciative
sort
of
person
he
offered
me
a
cigar
after
i
had
sat
down
in
his
study
so
i
did
n
t
have
any
difficulty
in
telling
him
right
off
what
i
had
come
for
i
ve
heard
from
my
hour
examinations
i
said
and
i
find
that
i
have
been
given
e
in
all
of
them
i
was
careful
not
to
say
that
i
had
failed
or
flunked
or
had
n
t
passed
as
that
was
not
the
impression
i
wished
to
convey
we
have
met
the
enemy
and
we
are
theirs
he
answered
pleasantly
yes
i
heard
about
that
he
went
on
and
i
hoped
you
would
come
in
to
see
me
then
he
waited
the
clock
began
to
get
at
last
he
glanced
up
and
said
what
was
it
doing
when
you
came
in
it
looked
like
snow
this
afternoon
but
i
had
n
t
gone
there
to
discuss
meteorology
so
i
ignored
his
remark
i
can
scarcely
think
i
could
have
failed
in
everything
i
suggested
it
is
somewhat
incredible
isn
t
it
the
young
man
murmured
i
never
stopped
writing
from
the
time
an
examination
began
until
it
stopped
i
said
what
did
you
think
it
strength
test
he
asked
brutally
i
told
all
i
knew
yes
he
acknowledged
your
instructors
were
convinced
of
that
and
i
don
t
think
i
got
enough
credit
for
it
if
i
had
the
books
here
i
feel
sure
i
could
make
this
plain
well
let
s
look
them
over
he
answered
readily
and
much
to
my
astonishment
he
went
to
his
desk
and
brought
back
all
my
i
confess
i
had
n
t
expected
anything
quite
so
definite
as
this
but
i
tried
to
appear
as
if
i
had
hoped
that
it
was
just
what
might
happen
we
sat
down
side
by
side
and
read
an
examination
question
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
full
set
of
the
papers
and
then
my
answer
to
it
explain
polarized
light
he
read
the
subject
of
polarized
light
as
i
understand
it
is
not
very
well
understood
i
began
at
which
my
adviser
put
his
hands
to
his
head
and
rocked
to
and
fro
if
you
don
t
mind
i
said
i
think
i
d
rather
begin
on
one
of
the
others
this
physics
course
is
merely
to
make
up
a
condition
and
perhaps
i
ve
not
devoted
very
much
time
to
it
it
isn
t
a
fair
test
so
we
took
up
the
history
paper
and
read
the
first
question
which
was
what
was
the
lombard
league
my
answer
i
considered
rather
neat
for
i
had
written
the
lombard
league
was
a
coalition
formed
by
the
lombards
i
paused
after
reading
it
and
glanced
at
my
adviser
it
was
a
simple
question
and
i
gave
it
a
simple
answer
i
murmured
i
m
afraid
you
depreciate
yourself
wood
he
replied
your
use
of
the
word
coalition
is
masterly
but
what
more
could
i
have
said
i
protested
i
don
t
think
you
could
have
said
anything
more
he
answered
inscrutably
i
read
on
and
on
and
he
interrupted
me
only
in
the
philosophy
course
to
point
out
politely
that
what
i
constantly
referred
to
as
hobbe
s
octopus
ought
to
be
hobbe
s
leviathan
and
once
in
the
questions
in
english
literature
to
explain
that
somebody
or
other
s
apologia
pro
vita
sua
was
i
had
translated
an
apology
for
living
in
a
sewer
i
could
have
killed
berrisford
for
it
sounded
so
plausible
too
for
any
one
who
lived
in
a
sewer
would
naturally
apologize
he
let
me
proceed
and
after
a
time
i
could
n
t
even
bring
myself
to
stop
and
contest
the
decisions
as
i
had
done
at
first
for
i
dreaded
the
way
he
had
of
making
my
most
serious
remarks
sound
rather
childish
so
i
rattled
on
faster
and
faster
until
i
found
myself
mumbling
in
a
low
tone
without
pronouncing
half
the
words
and
then
i
suddenly
stopped
and
put
the
on
the
table
and
stared
across
the
room
at
the
wall
he
did
n
t
express
any
surprise
which
on
the
whole
was
very
decent
of
him
and
after
a
minute
or
two
of
silence
during
which
he
gathered
up
the
evidence
and
put
it
back
in
his
desk
we
began
to
talk
football
and
our
chances
of
winning
the
big
game
he
said
some
nice
things
about
duggie
and
hoped
the
rumor
that
he
was
overtrained
was
n
t
true
i
told
him
that
i
lived
in
the
same
house
with
duggie
and
knew
him
very
well
and
feared
it
was
true
he
seemed
glad
that
i
knew
duggie
i
stayed
for
about
fifteen
minutes
so
as
not
to
seem
abrupt
or
angry
at
the
way
my
visit
had
turned
out
and
then
left
we
did
n
t
refer
to
the
exams
again
so
i
don
t
see
exactly
how
i
can
ever
right
the
wrong
they
have
done
me
if
my
adviser
were
a
different
kind
of
man
i
could
have
managed
it
i
think
i
have
n
t
seen
very
much
of
the
fellows
lately
except
of
course
at
is
to
say
at
luncheon
and
dinner
for
i
can
t
stand
their
comments
at
breakfast
they
greet
me
with
hello
old
s
this
i
hear
about
your
trying
for
the
phi
beta
kappa
is
it
true
that
you
re
going
to
get
your
degree
in
three
years
i
should
n
t
go
in
for
a
if
i
were
you
a
is
just
as
good
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
they
evidently
find
it
very
humorous
for
it
never
fails
to
make
them
all
laugh
i
ve
taken
to
breakfasting
at
the
holly
tree
as
i
don
t
often
meet
any
one
i
know
there
i
did
one
morning
however
come
across
the
little
instructor
who
had
charge
of
the
freshman
registration
and
made
quavering
remarks
at
me
in
a
kind
of
elizabethan
dialect
he
s
a
most
extraordinary
person
as
he
does
n
t
say
more
than
half
he
means
and
as
i
don
t
understand
more
than
half
he
says
i
find
conversation
with
him
very
exhausting
but
i
like
him
somehow
i
was
reading
a
newspaper
when
he
came
in
and
did
n
t
realize
that
he
was
standing
near
me
until
i
heard
a
slow
tremulous
reproachful
voice
saying
who
s
been
sitting
in
my
chair
it
seems
that
he
always
has
his
breakfast
at
the
same
table
in
the
chair
that
i
in
my
ignorance
had
taken
i
jumped
up
of
course
and
after
he
had
sat
down
and
leaned
back
he
murmured
feebly
i
m
an
old
man
but
i
know
my
place
i
did
n
t
know
why
he
said
this
as
he
is
n
t
an
old
man
at
all
he
can
t
be
more
than
or
i
m
a
young
man
but
i
seem
to
know
your
place
too
i
laughed
as
i
looked
around
for
another
chair
you
clever
boys
chaff
me
so
he
replied
mournfully
you
mustn
t
chaff
me
i
m
only
a
simple
villager
just
then
the
waitress
appeared
at
a
hole
in
the
fence
that
deludes
itself
into
thinking
it
differentiates
the
kitchen
from
the
and
the
little
man
pounded
softly
and
gently
on
the
table
exclaiming
what
some
sack
a
request
that
katy
evidently
understood
better
than
i
did
for
she
withdrew
and
came
back
in
a
moment
with
a
cup
of
tea
how
now
sir
not
my
hostess
of
the
tavern
a
most
sweet
wench
the
instructor
inquired
of
me
which
caused
had
lingered
to
hear
what
we
wanted
for
twist
a
corner
of
her
apron
around
her
finger
and
gurgle
ecstatically
now
fleetwood
you
stop
we
sat
there
talking
for
more
than
an
hour
and
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
had
so
improving
a
conversation
we
talked
mostly
about
books
and
plays
fleetwood
seems
to
care
a
great
deal
about
both
and
discussed
them
differently
from
the
way
most
people
do
at
our
table
at
brown
s
for
instance
a
book
or
a
play
is
always
either
rotten
or
a
corker
but
fleetwood
has
no
end
of
things
to
tell
about
them
he
seems
to
know
all
the
people
who
do
the
writing
and
acting
and
remembers
all
the
clever
remarks
they
ve
made
to
him
at
various
times
and
the
even
cleverer
ones
he
made
in
reply
finally
when
i
got
up
to
go
he
relapsed
suddenly
into
his
more
doleful
manner
and
said
you
will
come
to
my
wednesday
t
you
i
felt
as
if
i
ought
to
have
known
what
they
were
but
i
d
never
heard
of
them
so
i
suppose
i
looked
mystified
the
lions
roar
at
my
wednesday
evenings
he
explained
turning
on
the
tremolo
in
his
voice
but
they
won
t
hurt
they
like
me
they
ll
like
you
too
if
you
ll
come
i
said
i
should
like
to
come
very
much
when
do
you
have
your
wednesday
evenings
i
asked
for
he
was
so
dreadfully
vague
he
looked
at
me
vacantly
and
then
stared
at
the
ceiling
awhile
as
if
trying
to
think
on
wednesday
evenings
he
at
last
petulantly
quavered
and
i
left
for
i
began
to
think
i
was
losing
my
mind
with
the
exception
of
fleetwood
that
morning
i
have
n
t
met
any
one
else
i
know
at
the
holly
tree
to
tell
the
truth
i
haven
t
been
very
sociable
of
late
the
result
of
the
exams
was
rather
depressing
and
can
t
help
realizing
that
solitude
is
inexpensive
if
nothing
else
i
don
t
like
to
go
in
town
unless
i
can
pay
my
share
and
as
i
have
n
t
been
able
as
yet
even
to
get
my
watch
out
of
hock
in
spite
of
mamma
s
urgent
telegram
i
don
t
see
my
way
to
going
to
the
theatre
and
eating
around
at
expensive
hotels
of
course
i
could
have
the
tickets
they
re
the
least
of
it
and
anyhow
i
owe
so
much
already
i
hate
to
make
it
worse
berri
advised
me
to
pawn
the
fob
that
belongs
to
my
watch
and
get
the
watch
back
the
fob
has
a
huge
topaz
or
some
such
thing
in
it
that
ought
to
bring
a
lot
but
i
m
tired
of
disposing
of
heirlooms
i
went
to
the
first
symphony
in
sanders
theatre
the
other
night
duggie
gave
me
his
ticket
as
the
head
coach
and
the
doctor
who
looks
after
the
team
told
him
he
was
n
t
feeling
well
and
made
him
go
to
bed
instead
it
was
a
wonderful
concert
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
although
i
could
n
t
help
wondering
all
the
time
why
i
was
enjoying
it
for
a
man
who
looked
like
a
skye
terrier
played
beautiful
sad
things
on
the
cello
until
i
felt
so
lonely
and
homesick
and
as
if
i
had
wasted
my
life
and
broken
my
mother
s
heart
that
i
began
to
sniff
and
the
lady
who
was
sitting
next
to
me
she
had
a
huge
music
book
on
her
lap
and
was
following
every
note
with
her
finger
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
like
a
cobra
turned
and
glared
at
me
on
saturday
afternoon
they
would
n
t
let
duggie
play
in
the
game
and
advised
him
to
go
home
for
sunday
he
came
into
my
room
where
i
was
sitting
by
the
fire
feeling
pretty
blue
and
after
talking
awhile
said
he
wanted
me
to
go
with
him
berrisford
came
in
while
i
was
getting
ready
and
when
he
saw
how
little
i
was
taking
with
me
he
exclaimed
good
heavens
can
t
go
that
way
duggie
wouldn
t
mind
and
neither
would
his
family
but
you
must
show
consideration
for
the
servants
and
you
d
better
take
a
piece
of
bread
in
your
pocket
to
munch
when
nobody
s
looking
as
you
ll
get
there
too
late
for
tea
and
they
don
t
dine
until
sometime
during
the
middle
of
the
night
he
made
me
pack
my
they
ve
been
mended
and
gave
me
his
hairbrushes
as
they
have
ivory
backs
with
black
monograms
on
them
i
can
t
feel
thankful
enough
that
he
warned
me
in
time
for
everything
turned
out
just
as
he
said
berri
clever
there
s
no
getting
around
it
i
can
t
write
about
my
visit
it
s
too
late
to
do
justice
to
the
novel
and
delightful
time
i
had
i
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
even
the
thing
that
duggie
told
me
on
sunday
morning
did
n
t
spoil
it
berri
said
he
probably
took
me
home
with
him
in
order
to
break
the
news
gently
we
had
been
sitting
on
the
rocks
in
the
sun
looking
out
to
sea
and
listening
to
the
lazy
waves
break
over
the
beach
about
half
a
mile
away
at
that
distance
they
looked
like
a
flock
of
sheep
playing
on
the
sand
when
duggie
told
me
in
as
nice
a
way
as
one
possibly
can
tell
disagreeable
news
that
the
administrative
board
had
decided
to
put
me
on
probation
it
s
curious
how
little
you
know
after
all
about
the
fellows
here
of
whom
you
know
most
as
time
goes
on
i
suppose
you
gradually
learn
i
ve
been
told
by
upperclassmen
that
they
ve
seen
certain
fellows
every
day
for
years
and
while
apparently
intimate
with
them
have
never
taken
the
trouble
to
find
out
their
real
first
names
that
is
to
say
and
as
for
knowing
what
their
families
are
they
ve
been
used
to
before
they
came
to
can
only
guess
and
you
usually
guess
wrong
at
least
i
do
berrisford
however
is
very
wonderful
he
has
a
mind
as
comprehensive
in
its
scope
as
the
last
pages
of
an
unabridged
dictionary
and
his
talent
for
sizing
people
up
and
telling
you
all
about
them
is
really
remarkable
he
is
the
last
person
in
the
world
though
that
i
should
have
picked
out
as
a
citizen
of
salem
and
one
day
i
told
him
so
he
explained
himself
by
saying
that
his
mother
had
made
an
unfortunate
marriage
i
felt
very
sorry
as
the
only
time
i
saw
his
mother
i
thought
her
lovely
he
was
very
handsome
and
had
a
great
deal
of
money
and
was
the
best
and
most
delightful
man
i
ever
knew
berri
went
on
well
i
don
t
see
anything
so
dreadfully
unfortunate
in
all
that
i
ventured
ah
but
he
was
n
t
from
salem
berri
explained
simply
he
didn
t
even
have
any
cousins
there
although
for
a
time
mamma
s
family
tried
to
delude
themselves
into
believing
they
were
on
the
track
of
some
they
traced
him
back
to
humphrey
de
bohun
and
elizabeth
plantagenet
but
there
they
lost
the
scent
and
as
mamma
s
you
from
the
king
of
navarre
and
urracca
heiress
of
arragon
you
know
how
people
talk
it
was
all
very
sad
naturally
mamma
never
cared
to
live
in
salem
after
that
and
i
think
my
grandparents
were
rather
relieved
that
she
preferred
to
stay
most
of
the
time
in
france
they
used
to
come
over
and
see
us
every
few
years
but
of
course
no
one
in
salem
ever
knew
about
that
every
one
believed
that
grandfather
had
to
take
a
cure
at
least
that
was
what
was
given
out
whenever
he
went
abroad
i
suppose
i
can
t
help
seeming
somewhat
crude
now
and
then
he
mused
dismally
dilute
the
strain
and
it
s
bound
to
show
sooner
or
later
but
don
t
know
why
i
ve
told
you
all
this
it
is
n
t
the
sort
of
thing
one
can
discuss
with
everybody
all
this
was
intensely
interesting
and
mysterious
to
me
but
i
don
t
think
i
can
ever
get
on
to
it
entirely
just
when
i
m
beginning
to
feel
that
i
ve
mastered
the
details
i
collide
with
a
perfectly
new
phase
and
find
i
don
t
know
anything
at
all
my
ignorance
has
led
to
several
discussions
with
heated
kind
that
always
result
in
coldness
when
i
told
him
for
instance
that
i
d
met
billy
in
town
one
morning
and
he
d
taken
me
home
for
luncheon
berri
said
how
nice
and
proceeded
to
effect
a
union
of
his
eyebrows
and
the
top
of
his
head
now
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
billy
i
exclaimed
indignantly
for
i
d
enjoyed
my
luncheon
exceedingly
and
the
house
was
the
biggest
thing
i
had
ever
seen
oh
billy
s
all
right
he
s
really
very
nice
i
of
course
i
don
t
know
him
very
well
said
berri
why
do
you
ask
who
wouldn
t
ask
when
you
hang
your
eyebrows
on
your
front
hair
that
way
at
the
mere
mention
of
his
name
i
demanded
why
do
you
say
of
course
and
why
do
you
always
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
you
don
t
know
him
well
who
cares
whether
you
do
or
not
i
pursued
for
i
wanted
to
clear
this
mystery
up
once
and
for
all
well
you
seem
to
care
a
good
deal
berrisford
laughed
oh
not
personally
i
assured
him
only
in
the
interest
of
science
we
squabbled
for
an
hour
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
had
discovered
that
billy
s
family
spell
their
name
with
an
most
incriminating
thing
to
do
apparently
and
their
house
is
on
the
side
of
the
street
as
you
go
up
which
makes
it
easier
for
a
rich
man
to
pass
through
the
moat
into
heaven
than
to
draw
a
beam
of
recognition
from
the
eye
of
his
neighbor
it
was
all
very
as
berrisford
insisted
that
no
one
had
ever
told
him
these
had
known
that
they
were
so
when
he
came
into
the
world
well
i
don
t
see
how
you
ve
allowed
yourself
to
be
so
friendly
with
me
i
wondered
sarcastically
you
ve
been
pretty
reckless
it
strikes
me
how
do
you
know
what
side
of
the
street
our
house
is
on
in
perugia
whether
indeed
we
live
in
a
house
at
all
oh
you
re
different
berri
laughed
different
from
what
from
everything
that
s
why
i
m
willing
to
run
the
risk
you
re
a
strange
barbarous
thing
and
i
like
you
immensely
that
was
all
the
satisfaction
i
got
the
reason
i
thought
of
this
was
because
duggie
and
i
discussed
it
among
other
things
that
sunday
morning
on
the
rocks
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
duggie
s
family
lived
on
the
right
side
of
the
street
and
didn
t
spell
their
name
with
an
e
although
i
should
never
have
seen
them
in
this
light
if
berrisford
hadn
t
opened
my
eyes
poisoned
my
mind
duggie
called
it
duggie
s
father
resembles
the
duke
in
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
his
his
mother
is
like
duggie
one
could
n
t
say
very
much
more
than
that
my
impression
of
them
is
that
they
are
between
nineteen
and
twenty
feet
high
and
when
they
and
duggie
and
his
elder
sister
and
two
younger
brothers
were
assembled
they
looked
the
way
family
groups
of
crowned
heads
ought
to
look
and
don
t
the
sister
met
us
at
the
station
with
a
cart
and
two
ponies
they
told
me
to
take
care
of
myself
duggie
said
to
her
sort
of
doubtfully
he
s
afraid
of
my
nags
she
explained
to
me
as
i
clambered
up
beside
her
i
m
afraid
of
your
driving
duggie
answered
i
brought
jack
hollis
down
here
to
rest
one
saturday
and
sunday
he
said
to
me
and
after
she
d
whirled
him
around
the
country
for
several
hours
on
two
wheels
and
run
into
a
few
trees
and
spilled
him
over
a
cliff
the
poor
thing
went
back
to
town
with
heart
disease
and
has
never
been
the
same
since
now
of
course
duggie
merely
meant
to
give
me
an
exaggerated
idea
of
his
sister
s
driving
and
she
of
course
knew
that
his
remark
was
quite
innocent
but
nevertheless
she
began
to
blush
it
was
then
i
think
that
i
first
noticed
how
pretty
she
was
and
abruptly
gave
one
of
the
horses
a
slap
with
the
whip
that
sent
us
plunging
and
nearly
snapped
my
head
off
hold
on
tommy
duggie
called
to
me
this
is
what
i
go
through
every
time
i
come
home
then
as
a
flock
of
terrified
hens
scuttled
shrieking
from
under
the
ponies
feet
he
added
tell
them
i
was
very
brave
and
hopeful
to
the
end
and
that
my
last
words
were
about
the
team
but
pretty
soon
the
horses
settled
down
into
a
fast
steady
trot
and
we
bowled
along
the
prettiest
road
i
ve
ever
thick
woods
and
farther
on
great
uneven
meadows
marked
off
in
irregular
shapes
with
low
fences
of
rough
stone
the
meadows
to
the
right
ran
back
to
the
woods
but
the
ones
on
the
left
stretched
away
ahead
of
us
into
a
vast
plain
it
gave
me
a
queer
happy
feeling
that
i
can
t
if
i
were
going
to
soar
out
of
the
cart
and
over
the
on
into
space
i
could
n
t
imagine
where
such
a
sweep
of
luminous
horizon
led
seemed
extraordinary
to
come
across
anything
so
much
like
a
prairie
in
new
england
the
air
too
had
a
lot
to
do
with
the
way
i
felt
it
was
wonderful
cold
exactly
and
not
wet
although
i
thought
every
minute
that
it
was
going
to
be
both
it
had
a
peculiar
smell
to
it
that
without
knowing
why
i
liked
i
filled
my
lungs
with
it
and
somehow
it
made
me
feel
bigger
than
i
usually
do
then
all
at
once
the
ponies
scampered
over
the
top
of
a
little
incline
and
although
miss
sherwin
was
telling
me
something
i
gasped
out
s
the
ocean
and
forgot
what
she
was
saying
and
even
that
she
and
duggie
and
the
cart
were
with
me
at
all
for
i
had
never
seen
it
before
and
it
was
right
there
in
front
of
over
in
long
slow
green
pillowy
things
that
rolled
forward
and
slipped
back
forward
and
back
until
all
at
once
they
got
top
heavy
and
lost
control
of
themselves
and
tumbled
over
the
edge
in
a
delirious
white
and
green
confusion
that
slid
across
the
sand
in
swift
foamy
triangles
almost
up
to
our
wheels
and
made
the
ponies
shrink
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
in
a
sort
of
coquettish
dance
then
there
was
a
very
slim
lighthouse
on
a
gray
rock
bordered
by
a
little
white
frill
where
it
touched
the
water
and
beyond
that
putting
out
to
sea
was
a
great
ship
with
bulging
sails
and
a
steamer
that
left
a
lonely
trail
of
black
smoke
sagging
after
it
for
miles
i
don
t
know
how
long
i
stared
at
these
things
or
how
long
i
should
have
kept
on
staring
at
them
if
i
had
n
t
happened
to
glance
up
and
see
that
miss
sherwin
was
looking
down
at
me
and
laughing
i
think
she
expected
me
to
say
something
but
i
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
come
out
with
either
of
the
only
two
things
that
occurred
to
of
which
was
that
as
it
looked
so
exactly
as
i
always
thought
it
was
going
to
i
did
n
t
see
why
i
felt
almost
like
bursting
into
tears
when
we
came
over
the
and
actually
saw
it
and
the
other
i
should
have
very
much
liked
to
get
down
and
taste
it
however
miss
sherwin
had
about
all
she
could
do
to
attend
to
the
horses
and
did
n
t
insist
on
an
explanation
so
we
said
hardly
anything
all
the
rest
of
the
way
and
just
let
the
wind
blow
in
our
faces
and
watched
the
waves
tumble
across
the
hard
sand
for
miles
at
first
nothing
at
the
sherwins
seemed
in
the
least
real
to
me
even
duggie
struck
me
as
altogether
different
although
he
was
of
course
just
the
seen
in
unexpected
surroundings
first
of
all
when
we
arrived
a
groom
popped
up
from
behind
a
hedge
and
took
the
horses
then
two
young
men
in
dark
green
clothes
with
brass
buttons
and
yellow
waistcoats
bustled
down
from
the
piazza
to
get
our
things
out
of
the
cart
they
were
rather
handsome
but
had
very
troubled
expressions
and
looked
as
if
they
worried
a
good
deal
for
fear
they
shouldn
t
do
it
right
duggie
nodded
to
them
over
his
shoulder
and
i
think
they
were
secretly
gratified
at
i
suspect
them
of
having
worried
terribly
for
fear
they
might
betray
it
they
helped
us
off
with
our
coats
and
hats
when
we
got
inside
which
is
all
well
enough
and
makes
you
feel
as
grand
as
you
do
in
a
but
has
its
disadvantages
for
they
run
away
with
everything
you
have
and
lock
them
up
somewhere
in
a
safe
and
when
you
want
to
go
out
to
play
with
the
dogs
or
take
a
walk
and
think
it
all
over
you
usually
have
to
tell
vincent
to
tell
dempsey
to
tell
chamberlain
that
you
would
like
a
hat
miss
sherwin
led
me
through
some
beautiful
rooms
and
as
we
walked
along
she
turned
to
me
and
exclaimed
aren
t
you
fearfully
keen
for
your
tea
i
really
don
t
care
in
the
least
for
tea
in
fact
i
rather
dislike
it
but
she
seemed
to
take
it
so
for
granted
that
i
should
be
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
by
five
o
clock
that
i
hated
to
disappoint
her
and
was
going
to
say
oh
when
it
flashed
through
me
that
i
could
make
my
reply
more
elaborate
and
interesting
than
this
and
thought
it
would
be
rather
effective
to
murmur
one
gets
so
out
of
the
habit
in
cambridge
then
all
this
took
only
about
a
second
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
d
never
in
my
whole
life
drunk
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
afternoon
with
the
exception
of
the
time
that
berrisford
had
some
people
out
to
his
rooms
so
i
merely
was
perfectly
true
i
don
t
like
tea
but
i
like
those
thin
round
cakes
that
are
brown
at
the
edges
and
yellow
in
the
middle
this
made
her
laugh
and
i
was
glad
i
had
n
t
said
the
other
thing
because
she
s
very
pretty
when
she
laughs
one
corner
of
the
piazza
is
enclosed
in
glass
and
we
had
tea
out
there
where
we
could
watch
the
sunset
and
the
pink
lights
on
the
water
as
it
rolled
up
almost
to
the
lawn
in
the
front
yard
the
two
younger
brothers
came
of
them
has
a
tutor
and
the
other
goes
to
timothy
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
tea
things
to
be
brought
and
sherwin
sauntered
across
the
grass
i
forget
whether
they
had
been
gathering
orchids
in
the
conservatory
or
merely
feeding
the
peacocks
but
they
were
both
exceedingly
gracious
and
glad
to
see
me
yet
their
very
way
of
taking
me
so
for
granted
just
as
miss
sherwin
had
about
the
tea
made
me
uncomfortable
at
first
they
could
n
t
of
course
have
asked
me
to
explain
tell
them
what
right
i
had
to
consume
cakes
in
their
crystal
palace
and
enjoy
their
sunset
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
did
n
t
seem
to
expect
me
to
justify
myself
in
any
way
made
me
feel
like
an
impostor
the
man
who
brought
in
the
tea
things
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
this
i
m
quite
sure
that
he
disapproved
of
me
from
the
first
he
was
older
than
the
two
who
met
us
at
the
door
and
i
think
he
had
probably
long
since
ceased
to
worry
on
his
own
account
but
he
worried
a
lot
over
me
just
gave
up
all
his
other
duties
and
stood
behind
my
chair
mentally
calculating
the
chances
of
my
coming
out
even
or
behind
the
game
in
the
matter
of
knives
and
forks
whenever
i
used
too
many
or
too
few
which
i
did
constantly
he
would
glide
away
and
remedy
the
defect
or
craftily
remove
the
damning
evidence
of
my
inattention
in
writing
to
mamma
about
my
visit
i
ended
my
letter
by
saying
i
had
a
delightful
it
would
take
me
years
to
get
used
to
their
butler
to
which
mamma
replied
i
m
glad
you
enjoyed
yourself
dear
they
must
live
charmingly
but
i
simply
can
t
see
why
they
should
n
t
have
good
butter
it
s
so
easy
to
get
it
now
almost
anywhere
perhaps
they
don
t
eat
it
themselves
and
don
t
realize
that
they
are
being
imposed
upon
this
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
triumphs
of
papa
s
declining
years
as
he
is
always
blowing
me
up
about
my
handwriting
whenever
dempsey
the
other
servants
call
him
dempsey
came
into
the
glass
place
i
waited
in
a
sort
of
trembling
eagerness
half
expecting
him
to
announce
lord
and
lady
belgrave
and
miss
muriel
fitz
desmond
but
the
only
person
who
dropped
in
was
an
old
man
named
snagg
and
although
dempsey
made
as
much
out
of
his
arrival
as
any
one
possibly
can
t
after
all
do
miracles
with
a
name
like
snagg
however
i
was
grateful
to
snagg
for
coming
as
it
brought
me
back
to
earth
again
to
tell
the
truth
before
the
evening
was
finished
i
began
to
get
over
the
unreal
sensation
i
had
at
first
and
saw
very
plainly
that
whether
or
not
i
felt
at
home
depended
entirely
on
me
duggie
and
his
n
t
have
any
idea
that
their
dempsey
paralyzed
me
with
fright
or
that
just
as
berri
had
predicted
by
the
time
dinner
was
ready
i
was
shaky
in
the
knees
with
hunger
they
assumed
that
a
friend
of
duggie
s
naturally
would
feel
at
home
and
know
beforehand
what
was
going
to
happen
this
dawned
on
me
when
i
realized
that
duggie
was
exactly
as
he
always
is
and
that
the
others
were
probably
exactly
as
they
always
were
and
i
couldn
t
help
appreciating
after
a
time
that
if
they
took
me
so
calmly
it
was
rather
unreasonable
of
me
not
to
feel
the
same
way
about
them
no
one
made
any
effort
to
entertain
me
which
is
very
you
get
used
to
it
sherwin
played
solitaire
after
dinner
while
duggie
and
his
sister
she
was
embroidering
something
and
i
sat
around
a
fire
that
miss
sherwin
said
was
built
of
driftwood
from
an
old
whaler
and
duggie
declared
was
manufactured
with
chemicals
by
a
shrewd
person
in
maine
i
don
t
know
who
was
right
but
with
the
sea
murmuring
just
outside
the
windows
and
coming
down
every
now
and
then
with
a
great
thud
on
the
little
beach
at
the
end
of
the
lawn
i
preferred
to
believe
in
the
old
whaler
theory
sherwin
would
appear
every
few
minutes
to
read
us
something
he
had
come
across
in
a
volume
of
literary
reminiscences
which
reminded
him
of
something
entirely
different
that
had
happened
to
thoreau
or
emerson
or
hawthorne
or
margaret
of
whom
he
had
as
a
young
man
known
very
well
indeed
he
was
delightful
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
as
no
one
awoke
me
i
found
when
i
got
downstairs
that
it
was
after
ten
o
clock
and
that
everybody
with
the
exception
of
duggie
had
gone
to
church
duggie
had
been
up
for
hours
taking
a
long
walk
with
the
dogs
he
came
into
the
glass
place
on
the
piazza
where
i
had
breakfast
and
read
aloud
about
the
game
of
the
day
before
it
was
almost
as
warm
as
in
summer
so
we
took
some
books
and
strolled
along
a
cliff
to
a
sheltered
place
on
the
rocks
and
sat
down
in
the
sun
i
did
n
t
feel
much
like
reading
although
when
you
re
sitting
in
the
sun
i
think
it
s
rather
pleasanter
somehow
to
have
a
book
on
your
lap
duggie
had
a
shabby
little
volume
that
he
read
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
then
he
would
stop
for
five
or
ten
and
look
at
the
sea
swirling
around
a
rock
away
below
us
after
a
while
i
became
curious
to
know
what
the
book
was
and
the
next
time
he
closed
it
over
his
finger
i
reached
out
and
took
it
the
name
of
it
was
aurelius
antoninus
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
series
of
short
disconnected
paragraphs
with
a
great
many
footnotes
a
good
many
of
the
paragraphs
were
marked
the
only
one
i
can
remember
went
something
like
this
don
t
act
as
if
thou
wert
going
to
live
ten
thousand
years
death
hangs
over
thee
while
thou
it
is
in
thy
power
be
good
i
suppose
you
re
studying
this
for
some
course
i
remarked
after
i
had
read
the
extract
aloud
it
s
so
solemn
i
didn
t
think
you
could
be
reading
it
for
fun
i
added
i
don
t
suppose
i
am
reading
it
for
fun
exactly
duggie
laughed
it
isn
t
very
funny
to
realize
the
force
of
that
paragraph
when
there
are
so
many
things
you
hope
to
do
well
of
course
i
know
i
m
not
going
to
live
ten
thousand
years
but
it
s
so
lovely
down
here
that
i
don
t
feel
a
bit
as
if
i
were
n
t
i
said
lying
back
in
the
sun
and
closing
my
eyes
that
s
why
i
read
the
book
answered
duggie
it
s
tremendously
easy
to
feel
that
way
almost
here
particularly
he
was
more
serious
i
think
than
he
looked
why
should
n
t
one
i
asked
but
he
only
laughed
and
told
me
i
d
better
read
the
book
too
and
find
out
it
might
be
a
short
sort
of
revelation
it
took
me
a
good
while
to
arrive
at
it
by
myself
he
added
why
when
i
first
went
to
cambridge
i
had
an
idea
that
if
a
man
s
family
were
what
s
called
nice
and
well
known
and
if
he
had
good
manners
and
knew
a
lot
of
other
fellows
whose
families
were
nice
and
well
known
and
people
went
around
saying
that
he
d
make
the
first
ten
of
the
dickey
and
be
elected
into
some
club
or
had
an
idea
that
he
really
amounted
to
a
great
deal
well
does
n
t
he
i
asked
boldly
for
all
that
seemed
to
me
pretty
fine
i
think
duggie
was
going
to
answer
rather
sharply
but
he
must
have
decided
not
to
for
after
a
moment
he
said
i
suppose
whether
he
does
or
not
depends
on
the
point
of
view
from
yours
i
take
it
he
doesn
t
i
mused
he
has
a
lot
in
his
sorts
of
opportunities
that
other
people
have
n
t
duggie
admitted
but
i
ve
come
to
look
at
him
as
quite
unimportant
until
he
tries
at
least
to
take
some
advantage
of
them
good
heavens
the
wheels
of
the
world
are
clogged
with
nice
people
said
duggie
but
what
on
earth
can
a
person
do
in
a
place
like
college
for
instance
i
objected
you
re
there
and
you
know
your
own
crowd
and
you
re
satisfied
with
it
because
it
s
i
hesitated
awfully
nice
duggie
laughed
and
you
never
see
any
one
else
and
they
re
all
more
or
less
like
the
rest
of
your
class
is
composed
of
grinds
muckers
and
probably
very
decent
sort
of
chaps
here
duggie
reached
over
and
gave
me
a
push
that
nearly
sent
me
into
the
sea
but
dontche
didn
t
mean
to
get
started
and
anyhow
there
s
plenty
of
time
only
ten
thousand
years
i
replied
fleetwood
s
wednesday
evenings
begin
next
week
if
you
want
to
remove
your
infamous
towhead
from
its
richly
upholstered
barrel
for
a
minute
you
d
better
come
around
he
suggested
fleetwood
had
his
wednesday
evenings
on
friday
last
year
because
he
thought
it
was
more
i
see
he
s
changed
back
he
told
me
if
i
came
i
should
hear
a
lion
roar
i
said
trying
to
remember
my
talk
with
fleetwood
at
the
holly
tree
at
this
duggie
lay
back
and
shrieked
aloud
that
man
will
be
found
some
day
torn
into
small
neat
shreds
he
managed
to
say
at
last
why
i
i
knew
he
liked
fleetwood
why
because
i
m
the
lion
duggie
giggled
it
must
be
several
weeks
since
i
ve
written
a
word
in
my
diary
to
tell
the
truth
i
spend
so
much
time
writing
other
that
are
printed
and
the
somehow
my
own
affairs
don
t
seem
so
important
as
they
did
in
a
ve
been
made
an
editor
of
the
advocate
it
seems
so
wonderful
to
be
an
anything
of
anything
with
my
name
in
print
on
the
front
page
just
above
the
editorials
that
as
duggie
says
sarcastically
have
made
the
president
and
the
university
what
they
are
mamma
was
delighted
at
my
success
and
so
was
she
tried
to
be
funny
over
my
triolet
when
gladys
sings
in
the
last
number
and
wrote
me
that
unless
gladys
were
the
name
of
a
quadruped
of
some
kind
amputation
here
and
there
would
have
improved
her
even
papa
was
pleased
i
think
although
my
first
story
made
him
very
angry
and
he
wrote
me
a
terrible
letter
about
it
i
had
simply
described
as
accurately
as
i
could
remember
it
the
time
he
went
as
the
orator
from
perugia
to
make
a
political
speech
in
the
country
and
took
mildred
and
me
with
him
i
told
about
the
people
at
whose
house
we
stayed
described
the
house
and
recorded
our
conversations
at
dinner
and
supper
that
was
really
all
there
was
to
it
i
considered
it
quite
harmless
the
crimson
in
criticising
it
said
the
humorous
sketch
by
a
new
the
only
ray
of
sunlight
in
a
number
devoted
almost
exclusively
to
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
a
boston
paper
reprinted
it
in
full
and
papa
was
perfectly
furious
he
wrote
to
me
saying
among
several
pages
of
other
things
while
admitting
that
your
description
of
my
friends
is
photographic
and
in
an
inexpensive
and
altogether
odious
fashion
rather
amusing
i
take
occasion
to
call
your
attention
to
the
seems
to
have
escaped
they
are
after
all
my
friends
furthermore
passing
from
the
purely
ethical
to
the
sternly
practical
it
is
among
just
these
people
that
you
will
in
the
not
very
distant
future
be
engaged
in
making
or
trying
to
make
a
living
kindly
snatch
a
moment
or
two
from
your
literary
pursuits
and
think
this
over
in
some
of
its
more
grim
possibilities
he
also
rather
superfluously
informed
me
that
i
would
be
older
some
day
than
i
am
now
this
remark
by
the
way
seems
to
have
a
peculiar
fascination
for
men
who
have
passed
the
age
of
fifty
i
showed
the
letter
to
berri
and
when
he
had
finished
it
he
said
thoughtfully
a
few
communications
like
this
and
the
keen
edge
of
one
s
humor
would
become
a
trifle
dulled
my
election
to
the
advocate
came
about
in
the
most
unexpected
way
possible
it
s
queer
how
things
happen
berri
was
sitting
in
my
room
one
afternoon
apparently
reading
by
the
fire
suddenly
he
looked
up
and
exclaimed
do
you
realize
tommy
that
failure
is
staring
us
in
the
face
why
i
was
in
hopes
that
it
had
begun
avert
its
gaze
somewhat
i
answered
for
i
thought
of
course
he
was
referring
to
the
hour
i
ve
studied
a
little
every
day
since
that
calamity
besides
i
added
i
don
t
see
why
you
need
complain
you
got
through
oh
i
m
not
talking
about
our
studies
berri
said
impatiently
they
re
a
detail
i
mean
that
we
don
t
seem
to
be
getting
anywhere
we
re
not
turning
our
accomplishments
to
any
practical
account
we
re
not
helping
the
college
any
and
making
ourselves
in
a
lawful
sense
i
mean
but
we
haven
t
any
accomplishments
i
objected
we
both
tried
for
the
glee
club
and
they
would
n
t
have
us
and
everybody
agreed
that
we
couldn
t
play
we
went
out
and
did
everything
they
told
us
to
we
can
t
play
the
banjo
or
mandolin
and
it
s
too
early
in
the
year
to
find
out
whether
we
re
any
good
at
rowing
or
track
athletics
or
baseball
so
there
s
nothing
left
what
on
earth
can
a
person
do
who
has
n
t
any
talent
or
skill
or
ability
of
any
kind
i
demanded
gloomily
he
can
always
write
berri
answered
and
he
can
always
be
an
editor
oh
you
mean
we
ought
to
try
for
the
crimson
or
something
well
not
the
crimson
exactly
berrisford
mused
they
say
you
have
to
work
like
anything
on
the
crimson
they
make
you
rush
about
finding
out
when
things
are
going
to
happen
or
why
they
didn
t
happen
when
they
said
they
would
that
would
be
awfully
of
course
you
wouldn
t
care
whether
they
happened
or
not
i
d
just
like
to
sit
around
and
edit
any
one
could
do
that
i
should
think
you
d
go
in
for
the
lampoon
i
suggested
for
i
remembered
that
one
of
the
lampoon
men
had
drawn
a
picture
of
something
berri
had
done
professor
snook
who
knows
such
a
lot
about
was
going
to
give
a
lecture
in
sever
hall
on
the
devil
it
was
announced
on
all
the
bulletin
boards
by
means
of
printed
placards
that
read
like
this
thursday
november
professor
john
snook
will
deliver
a
lecture
on
the
devil
and
under
the
one
outside
of
university
berri
wrote
in
pencil
the
first
of
a
series
on
personalities
that
have
influenced
me
if
he
got
himself
noticed
by
the
lampoon
without
trying
i
thought
there
was
no
telling
what
he
could
do
if
he
put
his
mind
to
it
we
discussed
the
matter
awhile
without
however
deciding
on
any
definite
plan
that
night
we
went
to
fleetwood
s
first
wednesday
evening
and
there
i
was
introduced
but
i
m
going
too
fast
i
d
better
tell
about
the
wednesday
evening
first
when
i
suggested
going
berri
was
n
t
particularly
enthusiastic
about
it
he
said
he
was
afraid
it
would
resemble
one
of
his
aunt
s
receptions
where
everybody
was
so
cultivated
that
it
was
just
like
reading
half
hours
with
the
best
authors
on
a
warm
sunday
afternoon
i
had
an
idea
that
it
might
be
something
like
that
myself
but
i
finally
persuaded
berri
to
go
with
me
notwithstanding
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
myself
sometimes
when
i
m
with
duggie
i
m
inclined
to
take
things
rather
seriously
but
when
i
m
with
berri
it
all
seems
like
a
joke
they
re
so
different
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
i
were
so
much
a
friend
of
both
when
all
three
of
us
happen
to
be
together
i
find
it
most
uncomfortable
of
course
berri
thought
the
wednesday
evening
highly
amusing
it
was
rather
late
when
we
arrived
and
the
room
was
crowded
with
fellows
very
few
of
whom
i
had
ever
seen
before
fleetwood
opened
the
door
for
us
with
a
shakespearian
quotation
trembling
aptly
on
his
lips
and
led
us
through
the
crowd
to
his
inside
room
where
we
left
our
coats
and
hats
you
must
come
and
meet
my
lions
and
hear
them
roar
fleetwood
said
to
us
and
was
about
to
take
us
across
the
study
to
where
duggie
was
standing
against
the
wall
with
a
semicircle
of
freshmen
in
front
of
him
drinking
in
his
every
word
good
gracious
don
t
mean
to
say
you
got
me
away
over
here
on
a
cold
night
to
hear
duggie
sherwin
drool
about
football
berri
exclaimed
to
me
fleetwood
laughed
and
seemed
to
think
this
was
very
funny
just
look
how
glad
of
the
chance
all
those
others
are
you
unappreciative
boy
he
said
reproachfully
to
berri
oh
doesn
t
wake
them
up
at
a
horrible
hour
every
morning
yelling
like
a
fiend
under
a
berri
explained
you
see
the
lion
and
i
occupy
the
same
do
lions
live
in
a
den
i
never
can
remember
perhaps
ranny
knows
said
fleetwood
to
a
tall
fellow
who
had
evidently
planned
his
escape
and
was
in
the
act
of
shyly
carrying
it
out
when
fleetwood
detained
him
fleetwood
introduced
him
to
berri
and
slid
away
to
greet
another
man
who
had
just
opened
the
door
as
i
moved
off
to
join
duggie
s
group
berri
gave
me
a
queer
look
but
a
few
minutes
later
i
happened
to
glance
across
at
him
and
as
the
tall
fellow
was
laughing
at
everything
berri
said
i
knew
that
berri
was
enjoying
himself
duggie
shook
hands
with
me
and
said
just
as
if
he
had
n
t
been
in
my
room
sprawling
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fire
an
hour
and
a
half
before
and
then
went
on
with
what
he
was
saying
to
the
fellows
nearest
polite
looking
little
chaps
freshmen
although
i
had
never
seen
them
before
the
talk
was
mostly
about
football
the
games
that
had
been
played
and
the
ones
still
to
scores
and
the
merits
and
defects
of
players
at
other
colleges
of
course
duggie
could
discuss
only
with
the
fellows
just
in
front
of
him
i
think
he
realized
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
to
any
of
the
others
if
he
were
to
single
them
out
and
address
remarks
to
them
besides
it
might
have
sounded
patronizing
yet
every
now
and
then
when
whoever
was
talking
happened
to
say
something
funny
duggie
somehow
included
the
whole
crowd
in
the
laugh
that
followed
i
think
he
managed
it
by
catching
everybody
s
eye
at
just
the
right
time
i
know
i
was
merely
standing
there
looking
he
caught
mine
i
felt
as
if
i
were
right
in
the
game
this
often
had
the
effect
of
causing
a
fellow
to
say
something
to
the
fellow
next
to
him
and
so
it
frequently
happened
that
people
who
had
joined
the
group
merely
to
rubber
in
embarrassed
silence
at
duggie
found
themselves
making
acquaintances
and
talking
on
their
own
account
i
learned
afterward
that
this
was
precisely
what
fleetwood
and
duggie
counted
on
it
was
fleetwood
s
chief
reason
for
having
duggie
as
often
as
he
could
at
his
wednesday
evenings
and
duggie
s
only
reason
for
going
across
the
room
there
was
another
centre
of
attraction
in
the
person
of
a
fine
but
rather
old
gentleman
with
a
pink
face
and
a
snowy
beard
his
audience
was
more
talkative
than
duggie
s
but
not
so
large
it
was
n
t
composed
entirely
of
freshmen
either
as
i
was
standing
there
making
up
my
mind
to
slide
through
the
intervening
crowd
and
find
out
what
he
was
talking
about
berri
who
had
been
standing
with
a
rapt
expression
on
the
outskirts
of
the
second
group
detached
himself
and
came
over
to
me
you
simply
must
come
and
listen
to
him
it
s
perfectly
thrilling
he
said
i
was
just
going
over
to
investigate
i
answered
what
s
his
specialty
i
don
t
know
how
to
describe
it
exactly
berri
replied
he
s
a
kind
of
connecting
link
with
the
literary
past
he
s
what
phonographs
will
be
when
we
get
them
perfected
dickens
once
borrowed
his
on
the
evening
of
the
twelfth
of
june
years
ago
and
some
years
later
thackeray
stepped
on
his
foot
at
a
he
remembers
what
they
said
perfectly
and
gets
asked
out
a
lot
i
ve
heard
him
tell
the
thackeray
thing
twice
now
and
he
s
going
to
do
it
again
in
a
minute
if
there
s
enough
of
a
crowd
we
went
over
and
listened
to
him
for
ever
so
long
and
although
dickens
borrowed
his
and
thackeray
stepped
on
his
foot
he
was
n
t
in
the
least
what
berri
had
led
me
to
expect
i
found
him
delightful
and
was
sorry
when
he
had
to
leave
berri
insisted
that
he
was
driven
rapidly
to
town
to
the
palace
theatre
where
he
was
due
to
appear
at
a
trick
bicyclist
and
a
dutch
comedian
when
we
had
said
to
him
fleetwood
came
up
bringing
a
chap
with
spectacles
i
had
often
seen
him
in
the
yard
this
is
paul
fleetwood
said
to
me
and
he
wants
to
have
words
with
you
paul
talked
about
the
old
gentleman
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
quite
abruptly
we
ve
been
reading
your
stuff
in
english
wood
and
the
fellows
think
it
s
darned
good
i
wish
you
d
let
us
have
some
of
it
for
the
advocate
i
was
so
astonished
i
just
looked
at
him
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
wanted
to
print
two
of
my
jimsons
and
a
description
of
something
i
saw
one
night
in
that
if
i
wrote
a
third
and
it
turned
out
to
be
good
they
would
make
me
an
editor
he
had
said
that
the
monthly
had
designs
on
me
imagine
and
that
although
the
advocate
did
n
t
often
do
things
so
hastily
it
i
wonder
if
it
s
silly
of
me
to
write
this
down
didn
t
want
to
lose
me
i
told
him
that
i
d
never
dreamed
of
getting
on
one
of
the
papers
and
felt
as
if
he
were
making
fun
of
me
but
he
assured
me
he
was
n
t
duggie
and
berrisford
and
i
walked
home
together
and
when
we
reached
my
room
duggie
and
berri
began
to
squabble
over
fleetwood
s
wednesday
evenings
and
talked
and
talked
until
duggie
seeing
how
late
it
was
got
undressed
talking
all
the
time
and
left
his
clothes
on
my
floor
and
continued
the
conversation
even
after
he
had
gone
into
his
own
room
turned
out
the
lights
and
got
into
bed
berri
of
course
started
out
by
saying
well
i
don
t
see
what
s
the
good
of
it
and
duggie
immediately
undertook
to
enlighten
him
whereupon
that
the
attempt
might
be
another
tack
and
exclaimed
i
should
think
you
d
feel
so
ridiculous
backed
up
there
against
the
wall
making
perhaps
you
enjoy
being
an
object
of
curiosity
duggie
got
very
red
and
i
think
he
considered
berri
unusually
cheeky
and
impertinent
but
he
did
n
t
snub
him
and
i
m
sure
berri
was
disappointed
he
loves
to
irritate
people
i
don
t
think
my
feelings
in
the
matter
are
particularly
important
duggie
answered
i
don
t
see
why
you
haul
them
in
oh
but
they
are
berri
insisted
i
was
n
t
in
the
least
interested
in
you
when
you
were
over
there
doing
your
stunts
but
here
at
the
bosom
of
the
family
so
to
re
perfectly
absorbing
now
honestly
duggie
don
t
you
think
that
in
the
end
it
ll
do
you
a
lot
of
yourself
this
way
and
sort
of
saying
to
yourself
i
am
the
only
duggie
sherwin
when
fleetwood
tells
the
freshmen
that
i
am
going
to
be
there
the
room
is
jammed
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
of
course
that
s
what
it
amounts
to
duggie
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
then
he
leaned
forward
and
gave
berrisford
who
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
his
hands
clasped
around
his
knees
a
neat
little
push
that
rolled
him
back
until
he
seemed
to
be
standing
on
his
neck
and
groping
for
the
ceiling
with
his
feet
berrisford
sometimes
you
make
me
very
very
sick
duggie
said
to
him
but
own
up
like
a
t
that
the
way
you
look
at
it
berri
pursued
after
he
had
collected
himself
of
course
it
is
n
duggie
declared
indignantly
fleetwood
can
t
do
the
whole
thing
himself
he
can
t
turn
a
lot
of
shy
kids
into
a
pen
and
say
now
talk
and
get
to
know
one
so
he
asks
other
people
to
help
him
once
in
a
while
he
asks
me
there
were
two
of
us
two
little
uncle
topsies
berri
giggled
heaven
knows
i
can
talk
about
other
things
than
football
duggie
went
on
but
i
like
to
talk
about
it
and
they
do
why
shouldn
t
we
and
when
they
have
enough
of
me
they
get
to
talking
with
some
one
one
in
their
own
class
very
maybe
to
two
or
three
then
they
come
back
again
next
week
and
after
a
few
times
they
find
that
they
ve
made
a
lot
of
acquaintances
and
perhaps
some
friends
and
there
you
are
their
whole
four
years
is
probably
changed
for
them
and
made
infinitely
more
worth
while
merely
because
fleetwood
takes
the
trouble
to
round
them
up
and
make
them
feel
that
somebody
really
wants
them
it
s
perfectly
natural
that
you
should
think
his
wednesdays
funny
and
boresome
you
always
had
dozens
of
rooms
to
go
to
from
the
first
day
you
came
here
and
some
one
in
every
room
who
was
glad
to
see
you
when
you
went
but
i
tell
you
it
isn
t
that
way
with
everybody
and
you
re
not
the
kind
that
fleetwood
tries
to
get
at
why
did
he
invite
me
then
berri
asked
upon
my
soul
i
don
t
know
duggie
declared
sarcastically
but
i
d
be
willing
to
bet
that
if
i
see
him
first
he
won
t
invite
you
again
he
laughed
then
berri
admitted
that
fleetwood
s
idea
was
well
enough
in
theory
but
doubted
if
it
really
worked
that
tall
spook
i
jollied
this
evening
for
a
while
was
exceedingly
nice
but
i
sha
n
t
dash
off
and
call
on
him
i
don
t
suppose
i
ll
ever
see
him
again
berri
said
no
probably
not
duggie
assented
but
it
s
altogether
likely
that
after
time
has
healed
the
wound
left
by
your
indifference
he
may
find
consolation
in
the
companionship
of
some
one
else
you
may
not
be
able
to
grasp
the
fact
berri
but
it
is
a
fact
that
there
are
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
that
he
began
to
get
ready
for
bed
why
don
t
you
open
a
salon
yourself
if
you
think
they
re
such
berri
called
after
him
when
he
went
into
his
own
room
when
i
come
to
the
law
school
next
year
i
m
going
to
duggie
shouted
back
but
never
see
the
inside
of
it
i
ll
tell
you
that
right
now
i
did
n
t
join
in
the
discussion
at
all
for
i
got
to
thinking
how
lucky
i
had
been
from
the
first
mamma
overheard
an
old
woman
on
a
piazza
say
that
she
made
the
young
men
change
their
shoes
when
it
was
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
that
chance
remark
led
to
my
living
in
the
same
house
with
duggie
and
berri
and
what
a
difference
it
has
made
without
berri
i
never
in
the
world
should
have
known
such
a
lot
of
people
in
so
short
a
time
and
without
i
think
i
understand
what
my
adviser
meant
when
he
said
he
was
glad
i
knew
duggie
there
has
been
one
advocate
meeting
since
my
election
and
i
thought
it
was
great
all
the
editors
meet
in
the
advocate
president
s
room
on
tuesday
evening
to
hear
the
secretary
read
the
manuscripts
that
have
been
sent
in
or
collected
from
the
english
courses
during
the
week
it
took
them
a
long
time
to
settle
down
to
business
in
fact
no
one
seemed
to
want
to
hear
the
manuscripts
at
i
secretly
thought
this
would
be
very
several
fellows
made
remarks
and
tried
to
interrupt
the
poetry
especially
all
the
time
the
secretary
was
reading
but
he
read
on
in
a
businesslike
voice
and
never
paid
any
attention
to
them
except
once
when
he
grabbed
a
college
catalogue
from
the
table
and
without
looking
away
from
the
page
shied
it
at
a
fellow
who
was
repeating
the
verses
the
secretary
was
trying
to
repeating
them
all
wrong
and
making
them
sound
ridiculous
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
contributions
the
fellows
began
to
vote
no
before
they
had
read
them
half
through
but
several
of
them
were
hard
to
decide
on
and
the
board
had
a
lively
time
making
up
its
mind
after
the
reading
we
sat
around
the
fire
and
had
beer
and
crackers
and
cheese
while
as
several
of
the
manuscripts
expressed
it
the
storm
howled
without
a
few
afternoons
ago
the
secretary
he
has
such
a
queer
s
duncan
duncan
came
to
my
room
to
see
how
much
i
had
done
on
a
story
i
was
writing
it
was
a
little
after
six
o
clock
when
he
got
up
to
go
and
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
dinner
at
memorial
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
i
had
never
been
to
memorial
at
meal
time
and
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
go
it
s
a
very
interesting
experience
although
i
think
i
prefer
the
comparative
peacefulness
of
brown
s
as
a
usual
thing
we
were
joined
in
the
yard
by
a
friend
of
duncan
s
who
sits
at
the
same
table
duncan
is
a
thoughtful
rather
dreamy
kind
of
person
he
writes
a
lot
of
poetry
for
the
advocate
and
on
the
way
over
he
told
me
how
much
he
enjoyed
living
at
he
never
got
tired
of
looking
up
at
the
windows
and
the
severe
portraits
even
with
the
crowd
and
clatter
there
s
always
something
inspiring
about
its
length
and
height
he
said
it
has
a
calmness
and
dignity
that
quite
transcend
the
fact
of
people
s
eating
there
it
s
so
academic
it
s
so
cheap
the
other
fellow
amended
but
duncan
did
n
t
mind
him
and
became
almost
sentimental
on
the
subject
well
i
felt
sorry
for
duncan
we
had
hardly
begun
on
our
turkey
and
cranberry
sauce
when
two
of
the
colored
waiters
got
into
the
most
dreadful
fight
and
rushed
at
each
other
with
drawn
forks
all
the
men
jumped
up
on
their
chairs
and
waved
their
napkins
and
yelled
down
in
in
front
and
trun
him
out
as
the
newspapers
say
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
a
scene
of
indescribable
confusion
ensued
it
was
several
minutes
before
the
combatants
were
hustled
off
to
the
kitchen
and
we
could
go
on
with
our
dinner
then
a
party
appeared
in
the
visitors
man
two
women
and
some
girls
one
of
the
girls
was
decidedly
pretty
and
attracted
everybody
s
attention
the
moment
she
leaned
over
the
rail
the
man
however
was
what
caused
the
demonstration
in
the
first
place
he
didn
t
take
his
hat
off
which
duncan
says
always
makes
trouble
i
don
t
think
anybody
really
cares
one
way
or
the
other
but
it
furnishes
an
excuse
for
noise
a
murmur
of
disapproval
travelled
across
the
room
and
grew
louder
and
louder
until
the
man
with
a
genial
air
of
boys
have
recognized
me
came
to
the
front
of
the
gallery
and
bowed
he
took
off
his
hat
which
produced
a
burst
of
applause
from
below
and
then
put
it
on
again
which
changed
the
clapping
of
hands
to
ominous
groans
the
poor
thing
looked
mystified
and
embarrassed
and
i
don
t
know
how
it
would
have
ended
if
the
pretty
girl
hadn
t
just
at
that
instant
been
inspired
to
pluck
a
big
rose
from
her
belt
and
toss
it
over
the
rail
it
fell
with
a
thud
in
the
middle
of
our
table
and
eager
hands
shot
out
to
seize
it
i
grabbed
instinctively
with
the
others
and
with
the
others
i
m
exceedingly
ashamed
of
what
happened
the
tablecloth
and
all
the
dishes
were
swept
off
and
in
the
scrimmage
that
followed
the
table
was
overturned
i
have
a
terrifying
hideous
recollection
of
everybody
in
the
world
kneeling
on
my
chest
and
of
something
warm
and
wet
on
my
face
and
neck
then
duncan
was
saying
it
s
all
right
old
perfectly
still
you
ve
cut
yourself
a
little
but
it
doesn
t
amount
to
anything
only
don
t
exert
yourself
he
looked
so
scared
and
white
that
i
began
to
be
frightened
myself
and
tried
to
get
up
but
he
and
some
of
the
other
fellows
very
gently
restrained
me
saying
that
i
was
all
right
in
the
peculiar
hurried
fashion
that
more
than
anything
else
convinces
you
that
you
re
all
wrong
duncan
s
friend
and
another
fellow
were
mumbling
somewhere
near
me
i
caught
these
fragments
of
their
conversation
it
be
an
or
ten
minutes
if
it
is
n
t
attended
banning
and
doctor
t
talk
so
might
hear
then
i
lay
quite
still
and
closed
my
eyes
and
tried
to
think
looked
at
in
one
way
it
was
a
humiliating
thing
to
have
happen
but
on
the
other
hand
after
it
was
all
over
i
was
able
to
derive
considerable
satisfaction
from
the
fact
that
i
had
n
t
lost
my
presence
of
mind
the
remarks
i
overheard
as
i
lay
on
the
floor
of
memorial
were
anything
but
reassuring
i
realized
that
in
the
scrimmage
for
the
rose
i
had
been
submerged
in
china
glass
and
cutlery
some
of
these
things
had
severed
one
of
my
arteries
and
that
the
worst
might
happen
of
course
i
was
very
much
frightened
at
first
and
it
was
then
that
i
tried
to
get
up
but
after
they
restrained
me
i
sank
back
and
began
to
think
of
poor
mamma
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
for
writing
materials
but
on
remembering
that
an
accident
of
this
kind
was
always
attended
by
a
sort
of
dreamy
weakness
i
languid
that
i
recall
telling
myself
that
it
would
be
of
no
would
n
t
have
strength
with
which
to
write
even
if
a
pen
were
thrust
into
my
hand
so
i
went
on
thinking
about
mamma
until
suddenly
a
man
with
a
pointed
beard
i
have
since
learned
he
was
a
medical
student
who
happened
to
be
dining
with
some
friends
at
memorial
dropped
on
one
knee
beside
me
and
with
rapid
skilful
fingers
began
to
open
my
shirt
then
he
stopped
very
abruptly
and
with
the
most
disgusted
expression
i
ever
saw
turned
toward
the
light
and
examined
his
fingers
after
which
he
got
up
brushed
the
dust
from
his
knee
and
said
in
a
loud
peevish
voice
tell
that
child
to
get
up
and
go
home
and
wash
the
off
his
face
and
neck
and
put
on
clean
clothes
which
i
did
as
quickly
as
possible
without
even
waiting
to
say
to
duncan
they
don
t
call
me
tommy
trusting
any
more
it
became
cranberry
for
a
day
or
two
then
it
was
shortened
to
cranny
and
now
it
s
granny
granny
wood
berri
says
that
it
has
a
ring
of
finality
to
it
and
that
i
ll
never
be
known
by
any
other
name
since
the
great
game
i
don
t
believe
i
ve
touched
upon
the
great
game
the
college
seems
to
have
settled
down
once
more
to
an
sort
of
existence
with
the
christmas
holidays
looming
up
now
and
then
in
letters
from
home
as
i
was
going
out
this
morning
the
postman
met
me
at
the
gate
and
gave
me
four
letters
with
the
perugia
postmark
it
s
funny
how
my
feelings
toward
that
poor
man
vary
when
he
hands
me
letters
from
home
i
think
he
s
one
of
the
persons
i
ever
saw
but
when
he
doles
out
a
lot
of
bills
he
seems
to
have
a
hard
cynical
expression
that
i
hate
i
meet
him
at
the
holly
tree
occasionally
where
he
goes
to
snatch
a
nourishing
breakfast
of
coffee
and
i
have
n
t
alluded
to
the
great
game
for
several
chief
one
being
that
as
berri
says
when
people
explain
why
they
didn
t
pass
certain
exams
i
dislike
i
suppose
it
might
have
been
in
various
ways
a
more
distressing
event
than
it
actually
was
the
seats
for
instance
might
have
collapsed
and
killed
all
the
spectators
there
might
have
been
a
railway
collision
on
the
way
down
there
might
have
been
an
earthquake
or
a
that
none
of
these
things
happened
is
of
course
cause
for
not
for
bonfires
and
red
lights
on
holmes
field
it
is
always
well
i
suppose
to
have
something
definite
to
rejoice
over
the
long
trip
in
the
train
back
to
boston
after
the
game
with
every
one
hoarse
and
tired
out
and
cross
and
depressed
but
i
had
determined
not
to
mention
it
at
all
poor
duggie
i
know
it
nearly
killed
him
he
has
tried
to
refer
to
it
philosophically
and
calmly
in
my
room
once
or
twice
since
then
but
he
never
gets
very
far
he
knows
what
he
wants
to
say
and
ought
to
say
but
he
s
so
intimate
with
berri
and
me
that
i
don
t
think
he
altogether
trusts
himself
to
say
it
i
imagine
he
finds
it
easier
to
talk
to
comparative
strangers
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
berri
was
going
to
find
in
the
subject
a
sort
of
inexhaustible
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
his
genius
for
making
people
uncomfortable
but
instead
of
that
i
ve
never
known
him
to
be
so
nice
for
the
first
time
he
has
allowed
himself
to
show
some
of
the
admiration
for
duggie
that
all
along
i
ve
felt
sure
he
really
has
and
duggie
appreciates
his
in
one
way
it
grates
on
him
almost
as
much
i
think
as
if
berri
were
just
as
he
always
is
the
other
day
mamma
said
in
one
of
her
letters
i
often
wonder
how
you
spend
your
days
just
what
you
do
from
the
time
you
go
out
to
breakfast
until
you
go
to
bed
hesitate
to
think
o
clock
so
when
i
answered
her
letter
i
tried
to
put
in
everything
i
did
that
day
and
here
it
is
up
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
dream
in
which
a
burglar
was
pressing
a
revolver
to
my
temple
and
found
that
beast
saga
standing
by
my
bed
with
his
cold
moist
nose
against
my
cheek
i
threw
shoes
at
him
until
he
ran
away
yelping
which
hurt
berri
s
feelings
and
made
him
very
disagreeable
to
duggie
and
me
about
the
bathtub
he
said
we
ought
to
let
him
have
his
bath
first
as
it
took
him
so
much
longer
breakfast
at
the
holly
tree
berri
came
with
me
as
he
said
he
disliked
last
chapters
and
it
was
brown
s
day
for
concluding
her
great
serial
story
entitled
corned
beef
at
the
holly
tree
we
found
fleetwood
who
hid
coquettishly
behind
a
newspaper
when
he
saw
us
coming
and
exclaimed
go
away
away
you
unreverend
clever
boy
he
added
shaking
his
finger
at
berri
i
don
t
mind
the
other
little
one
he
went
on
when
we
had
hung
up
our
coats
and
hats
and
went
over
to
his
table
but
you
have
a
tongue
with
a
i
sha
n
t
ask
you
again
to
my
wednesday
evenings
of
course
this
was
perfect
fruit
for
berri
who
sat
down
at
once
and
implored
fleetwood
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
tell
him
what
he
had
done
and
begged
him
not
to
blight
his
berri
s
career
at
the
outset
by
denying
him
admission
to
the
wednesday
evenings
he
vowed
that
he
felt
ever
so
much
older
and
broader
and
thoughtfuller
and
all
sorts
of
things
that
he
never
in
the
world
will
feel
just
for
going
that
once
but
fleetwood
pretended
not
to
listen
to
him
and
went
on
reading
the
paper
interrupting
berri
every
now
and
then
with
or
i
think
he
really
likes
berri
immensely
but
is
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
he
never
can
get
at
him
by
being
serious
we
had
a
very
jolly
breakfast
and
berri
left
declaring
that
he
would
n
t
rest
until
he
had
induced
some
famous
man
to
step
on
his
feet
then
i
ll
be
a
lion
myself
and
i
sha
n
t
go
to
your
wednesday
evenings
no
matter
how
much
you
ask
me
he
said
at
which
fleetwood
held
his
head
with
one
hand
and
waved
toward
the
door
with
the
other
moaning
go
away
away
both
of
you
you
ve
caused
me
to
drink
four
cups
of
tea
without
knowing
what
i
was
doing
i
think
you
want
to
drive
me
mad
neither
of
us
had
a
lecture
until
eleven
o
clock
and
we
were
looking
at
some
new
books
in
a
window
on
the
square
when
hemington
appeared
he
touched
us
on
the
shoulders
in
a
confidential
kind
of
way
and
then
looking
furtively
at
the
people
who
were
waiting
near
by
for
a
car
lowered
his
voice
mysteriously
and
asked
us
to
go
with
him
to
his
room
i
have
something
over
there
that
i
don
t
mind
letting
you
in
on
he
said
only
you
must
n
t
of
course
speak
of
it
it
might
get
us
into
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
the
government
this
sounded
rather
exciting
so
we
hurried
to
hemington
s
room
without
talking
much
on
the
way
over
as
hemington
did
n
t
communicate
anything
further
and
we
of
course
could
n
t
help
wondering
what
he
was
going
to
show
us
when
we
got
into
his
study
he
gave
a
peculiar
rap
on
his
bedroom
door
and
out
came
a
little
person
and
plump
with
black
curly
hair
and
big
black
eyes
and
a
sallow
almost
dusky
skin
a
bright
red
handkerchief
knotted
loosely
around
his
neck
gave
him
a
picturesque
a
tropical
air
that
considering
we
were
in
hemington
s
prosaic
study
in
stoughton
hall
thrilled
us
from
the
first
this
is
amadéo
said
hemington
hemi
is
taking
spanish
and
i
think
he
enjoyed
as
much
as
anything
pronouncing
the
name
in
a
deep
rich
careless
sort
of
way
he
hauled
it
in
every
other
second
it
s
all
right
amadéo
he
went
on
for
although
amadéo
smiled
a
most
beautiful
smile
full
of
very
regular
and
dazzling
teeth
he
turned
to
hemington
with
a
look
intended
to
express
inquiry
and
misgiving
you
can
trust
these
men
they
are
your
friends
at
this
amadéo
flashed
his
teeth
again
and
kissed
berri
s
hands
berri
looked
exceedingly
shocked
and
i
craftily
put
mine
in
my
pocket
he
s
a
deserter
hemington
explained
for
berri
began
to
rub
his
knuckles
with
a
handkerchief
amadéo
looked
hurt
and
there
was
a
moment
of
embarrassment
all
round
he
escaped
from
a
merchantman
that
got
in
a
few
days
ago
from
as
i
don
t
take
spanish
it
s
impossible
for
me
to
give
the
luscious
name
of
the
island
that
amadéo
s
boat
had
come
from
it
sounded
something
like
santa
bawthawthawthoth
the
skipper
was
a
regular
old
timer
and
amadéo
could
n
t
stand
it
any
longer
he
and
a
pal
swam
ashore
with
all
their
worldly
possessions
on
their
backs
done
up
in
tarpaulins
they
were
fired
at
six
times
when
they
were
in
the
water
and
his
possessions
here
hemington
lowered
his
voice
and
amadéo
glanced
sharply
at
the
door
consisted
of
three
or
four
hundred
of
the
best
cigars
you
ever
smoked
in
your
life
he
got
them
at
santa
bawthawthawthoth
and
as
he
has
n
t
a
cent
of
course
he
wants
to
sell
them
he
asks
about
a
fourth
as
much
as
you
have
to
pay
for
a
perfectly
wretched
cigar
at
any
place
in
town
they
naturally
did
n
t
go
through
the
custom
house
and
that
s
why
you
have
to
keep
it
all
so
quiet
amadéo
went
into
hemington
s
bedroom
and
returned
with
an
bundle
that
looked
like
those
round
flat
cheeses
you
see
under
cages
of
green
wire
in
grocery
stores
he
untied
it
glancing
apprehensively
at
the
door
from
time
to
time
and
once
clasping
it
to
his
breast
when
he
heard
a
step
in
the
hall
outside
and
disclosed
the
smuggled
treasure
i
have
n
t
begun
to
smoke
yet
but
berri
and
hemington
each
took
a
cigar
and
after
puffing
away
for
several
seconds
berri
said
his
was
simply
delicious
it
certainly
smelled
very
good
and
i
was
very
sorry
i
had
to
run
away
in
a
few
minutes
to
my
eleven
o
clock
lecture
for
amadéo
began
to
tell
of
some
of
his
experiences
on
the
merchantman
and
they
were
pretty
fierce
berri
cut
his
lecture
and
i
should
have
if
i
were
n
t
on
probation
one
of
the
penalties
of
probation
is
that
you
can
t
cut
without
an
excuse
that
holds
water
at
every
pore
listened
to
a
physics
the
experiments
did
n
t
turn
out
well
and
the
instructor
seemed
much
annoyed
i
don
t
think
he
has
the
right
idea
my
experiments
in
the
laboratory
always
give
beautiful
results
i
find
out
first
of
all
from
the
book
what
nature
is
expected
to
do
and
then
i
see
that
she
does
it
i
m
one
of
the
most
successful
little
experimenters
in
the
class
ran
back
to
hemington
s
room
amadéo
had
gone
but
berri
and
hemington
had
bought
all
the
cigars
berri
had
learned
a
lot
of
spanish
in
my
absence
and
could
say
amadéo
and
santa
bawthawthawthoth
with
almost
as
fluent
a
effect
as
hemington
could
he
packed
his
share
of
the
cigars
in
hemi
s
case
and
we
took
them
over
to
our
house
went
to
luncheon
at
brown
s
and
tried
to
borrow
a
shirt
from
everybody
at
the
table
but
without
success
duncan
duncan
asked
me
to
a
tea
in
his
rooms
this
afternoon
to
meet
his
mother
and
sisters
and
some
girls
from
town
i
promised
to
go
but
miss
shedd
my
washerwoman
slipped
on
the
ice
and
hurt
herself
and
has
n
t
been
able
to
do
my
clothes
for
more
than
two
weeks
and
i
discovered
this
morning
that
there
were
no
more
shirts
in
my
drawer
berri
or
duggie
would
lend
me
one
but
berri
unfortunately
hasn
t
any
either
as
miss
shedd
does
his
washing
too
and
of
course
anything
of
duggie
s
on
me
is
ridiculous
i
wore
a
suit
of
his
pajamas
one
night
when
i
had
a
cold
as
they
re
thicker
than
mine
and
the
shoulders
hung
down
around
my
elbows
well
nobody
would
lend
me
a
no
reason
in
the
world
except
that
they
realized
i
simply
had
to
have
one
and
thought
it
would
be
amusing
not
to
while
we
were
at
luncheon
berri
and
hemington
gave
every
one
two
or
three
cigars
and
berri
said
knowingly
i
wish
you
fellows
would
try
these
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
i
happened
to
get
hold
of
them
in
a
rather
odd
way
i
can
t
tell
you
how
least
not
for
a
few
days
they
re
not
the
usual
thing
you
buy
at
a
store
they
come
from
santa
bawthawthawthoth
we
went
on
talking
and
forgot
all
about
the
cigars
until
berri
who
is
very
sensitive
to
any
kind
of
scent
or
odor
suddenly
looked
up
and
said
what
a
perfectly
excruciating
smell
it
s
like
overshoes
on
a
hot
register
only
much
worse
what
on
earth
is
it
at
this
the
rest
of
us
at
the
table
began
to
sniff
the
air
and
i
confess
it
was
pretty
bad
bertie
stockbridge
had
finished
his
luncheon
while
we
were
still
eating
and
had
taken
his
chair
over
to
the
window
where
he
was
reading
something
for
a
one
recitation
and
smoking
one
of
amadéo
s
cigars
he
was
too
absorbed
in
his
book
to
hear
the
rest
of
us
but
all
at
once
he
looked
up
with
a
very
pained
expression
and
exclaimed
what
a
beastly
cigar
i
was
reading
and
did
n
t
notice
how
queer
it
was
it
s
made
me
very
sick
then
of
course
we
all
discovered
at
once
where
the
hot
rubbery
fumes
came
from
but
berri
and
hemington
that
is
to
say
they
refused
to
believe
it
so
everybody
began
to
light
cigars
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
room
was
simply
unendurable
stockbridge
said
they
were
like
the
trick
cigars
you
see
advertised
sometimes
the
kind
that
explode
with
a
red
light
the
smoker
and
amusing
the
spectators
we
dissected
several
of
them
they
seemed
to
contain
a
little
of
everything
except
tobacco
the
fellows
insisted
on
knowing
all
the
details
of
the
colossal
sell
and
although
berri
and
hemington
felt
awfully
cheap
about
their
part
in
it
they
finally
told
duggie
says
an
amadéo
or
a
manuele
or
a
luigi
or
an
anselmo
appears
in
cambridge
every
year
at
about
this
time
and
invariably
returns
to
santa
bawthawthawthoth
laden
with
freshman
gold
rushed
home
got
a
shirt
and
took
it
to
a
chinese
laundry
just
off
mt
auburn
street
and
implored
the
proprietor
to
wash
it
and
have
it
ready
for
me
by
five
o
clock
he
seemed
to
think
me
somewhat
insane
and
said
in
a
soothing
fatherly
kind
of
way
you
come
back
day
aftle
then
i
explained
the
situation
and
told
him
i
would
give
him
anything
he
asked
if
he
would
do
me
this
favor
he
made
strange
oriental
sounds
at
which
sleepy
gibbering
things
tumbled
out
of
a
shelf
behind
a
green
calico
curtain
and
from
a
black
hole
in
the
partition
at
the
end
of
the
shelf
there
began
a
tremendous
grunting
and
snuffling
pierced
by
squeaks
of
rage
and
anguish
then
five
chinamen
swarmed
about
my
shirt
gesticulating
murderously
and
uttering
raucous
cries
like
impossible
birds
i
wanted
to
stay
and
see
how
it
all
turned
out
but
the
bell
had
rung
for
my
one
o
clock
and
i
hurried
away
the
oriental
temperament
is
an
impassive
deliberative
inscrutable
thing
this
hour
i
spent
in
class
listening
to
a
lecture
on
narration
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
the
hour
went
by
so
quickly
that
when
the
instructor
dismissed
us
i
thought
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
gave
us
short
scenes
from
various
famous
books
in
illustration
of
his
points
and
ended
as
usual
by
reading
a
lot
of
daily
themes
written
by
the
class
two
of
them
were
mine
he
said
they
were
good
but
pointed
out
how
they
could
have
been
better
one
of
his
suggestions
i
agree
with
perfectly
but
i
think
he
s
all
off
in
regard
to
the
other
i
ll
talk
it
over
with
him
at
his
next
consultation
hour
some
of
the
fellows
thought
the
whole
thing
perfect
drool
but
i
confess
it
interested
me
very
much
i
never
feel
like
cutting
this
course
somehow
went
to
my
room
with
the
intention
of
reading
history
until
it
was
time
to
go
for
my
shirt
it
was
done
ready
for
the
tea
i
had
read
only
part
of
a
chapter
when
some
fellows
passing
by
yelled
at
my
windows
i
had
made
up
my
mind
when
i
began
to
read
not
to
answer
any
one
as
it
s
impossible
to
accomplish
anything
if
you
do
but
of
course
i
forgot
and
yelled
back
and
in
a
minute
three
fellows
clattered
up
the
stairs
and
i
realized
that
they
were
good
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
it
s
a
queer
thing
about
going
to
see
people
here
i
don
t
think
that
any
one
ever
goes
with
the
intention
of
staying
any
length
of
time
or
even
of
sitting
down
you
merely
drop
in
as
you
re
passing
by
and
happen
to
think
of
it
you
would
n
t
believe
it
if
somebody
told
you
you
were
destined
to
stay
for
several
hours
but
that
s
what
usually
happens
another
queer
thing
is
that
very
few
fellows
admit
that
they
re
studying
when
you
come
in
unless
of
course
it
s
in
the
midst
of
the
exams
if
you
find
a
man
at
a
desk
with
a
and
several
large
open
volumes
spread
out
before
him
and
you
say
to
him
don
t
mind
on
with
your
grinding
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
ll
answer
oh
i
wasn
t
grinding
i
was
just
glancing
over
these
notes
the
tenth
man
fixes
you
with
a
determined
eye
and
replies
you
get
out
of
here
or
take
a
book
and
go
into
a
corner
and
shut
up
we
all
took
a
walk
up
brattle
street
past
the
longfellow
house
as
far
as
james
russell
lowell
s
place
and
back
it
s
a
great
old
street
even
with
the
leaves
all
makes
ordinary
places
so
dreary
duggie
pointed
out
the
most
famous
houses
to
me
one
day
and
told
me
who
had
lived
in
them
i
tried
to
do
it
this
afternoon
but
the
fellows
said
they
did
n
t
care
got
my
shirt
at
the
chinaman
s
it
looked
all
right
but
it
was
still
damp
in
in
fact
i
went
prepared
to
pay
almost
any
price
after
all
the
excitement
i
had
caused
but
the
proprietor
was
surprisingly
moderate
in
his
demands
i
gave
him
something
more
than
he
asked
but
he
would
n
t
take
it
until
i
accepted
some
dried
berries
done
up
in
a
piece
of
oiled
paper
he
seemed
to
have
grasped
the
idea
of
a
tea
for
he
kept
saying
over
and
over
again
with
a
delighted
smile
you
go
see
go
see
girl
went
to
duncan
s
tea
and
saw
girl
of
them
they
were
very
nice
and
pretended
they
were
dreadfully
excited
at
being
in
a
college
room
they
asked
all
sorts
of
silly
questions
and
the
fellows
replied
with
even
sillier
answers
duncan
had
taken
them
to
see
the
museums
and
the
glass
flowers
and
memorial
and
the
gym
and
had
done
the
honors
of
cambridge
generally
went
to
dinner
at
brown
s
but
as
i
had
just
come
from
duncan
s
where
i
had
drunk
two
cups
of
tea
i
don
t
know
why
as
i
hate
it
and
had
eaten
several
kinds
of
little
cakes
i
had
no
appetite
whatever
somebody
had
put
a
chocolate
cigar
on
berri
s
and
hemington
s
plate
kind
that
has
a
piece
of
gilt
paper
glued
to
the
large
end
berri
and
hemington
had
to
stand
a
good
deal
of
guying
during
dinner
but
were
consoled
by
the
fact
that
amadéo
s
pal
had
worked
precisely
the
same
game
on
some
other
men
we
know
slightly
at
the
very
moment
that
amadéo
himself
was
doing
us
went
to
my
room
and
made
a
big
fire
as
i
had
a
curious
kind
of
chill
although
the
house
was
warm
and
it
was
n
t
cold
outside
i
had
just
decided
to
stay
at
home
and
read
when
i
came
across
an
advocate
postal
card
on
my
desk
and
remembered
that
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
board
in
the
secretary
s
room
at
eight
o
clock
listened
to
manuscripts
and
voted
on
them
and
then
sat
around
and
talked
afterwards
it
s
rather
embarrassing
sometimes
when
a
story
happens
to
be
by
one
of
the
editors
and
isn
t
good
this
evening
we
had
a
long
terribly
sentimental
passage
from
the
life
of
a
member
of
the
board
we
all
knew
who
had
written
it
and
although
it
was
ever
so
much
worse
than
the
tale
that
had
just
been
read
which
had
been
most
unmercifully
jumped
on
the
criticisms
were
painfully
cautious
and
generously
sprinkled
with
the
praise
that
damns
of
course
it
isn
t
always
this
way
when
the
editors
submit
things
they
re
often
made
more
fun
of
than
anybody
else
but
this
man
for
some
reason
is
n
t
the
kind
with
whom
that
sort
of
thing
goes
down
he
has
been
known
to
refer
to
writing
for
the
advocate
as
my
art
one
thing
that
happened
during
the
evening
made
a
good
deal
of
fun
the
advertisers
have
kicked
about
our
not
having
the
leaves
of
the
paper
cut
they
say
that
the
subscribers
cut
the
leaves
of
the
reading
matter
only
and
never
get
a
chance
to
see
the
advertisements
at
all
we
think
it
is
ever
so
much
nicer
not
to
have
it
done
by
machinery
for
when
the
subscribers
do
it
themselves
with
a
the
effect
on
the
thick
paper
is
very
rough
and
artistic
well
we
discussed
this
for
a
long
time
until
some
one
exclaimed
i
don
t
see
why
we
shouldn
t
have
it
done
by
hand
it
would
take
a
little
longer
but
the
expense
would
n
t
amount
to
much
and
in
that
way
we
could
have
our
rough
edges
and
appease
the
advertisers
at
the
same
time
so
after
some
more
talk
it
was
voted
on
and
carried
unanimously
then
the
president
got
up
and
turning
to
a
solemn
person
who
had
been
very
much
in
favor
of
the
motion
said
it
has
been
moved
and
carried
that
the
leaves
of
the
advocate
be
cut
henceforth
by
hand
hand
you
will
kindly
see
that
the
work
is
done
on
time
i
think
there
are
only
eight
or
nine
hundred
copies
printed
this
year
on
the
way
home
from
the
advocate
meeting
i
saw
the
most
gorgeous
northern
lights
i
ever
imagined
shafts
of
deep
pink
that
shot
up
from
the
horizon
and
all
joined
at
the
middle
of
the
sky
like
a
glorious
umbrella
i
ran
upstairs
to
get
duggie
and
berri
but
neither
of
them
was
in
so
as
i
simply
had
to
have
some
one
to
marvel
with
i
called
chester
she
and
another
old
having
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
and
did
n
t
seem
particularly
enthusiastic
over
my
invitation
to
come
out
and
see
the
display
but
they
finally
bundled
up
in
shawls
and
followed
me
to
the
piazza
we
stood
there
a
minute
or
two
looking
up
in
silence
and
i
thought
at
first
that
they
were
as
much
impressed
as
i
was
finally
however
chester
gave
a
little
society
cough
and
remarked
it
s
real
chilly
aren
t
it
and
mis
buckson
drawing
her
shawl
more
tightly
about
her
bent
shoulders
jerked
her
chin
in
an
omnipotent
blasé
kind
of
fashion
towards
the
heavens
and
croaked
that
there
s
a
sign
o
war
then
they
both
limped
back
to
the
house
made
a
big
blaze
in
the
fireplace
as
i
was
cold
again
and
did
n
t
feel
well
at
all
i
sat
down
to
write
to
mamma
and
was
just
finishing
when
duggie
came
in
on
his
way
to
bed
he
s
not
in
training
now
and
can
stay
up
as
long
as
he
pleases
he
asked
me
how
often
i
wrote
to
mamma
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
written
twice
a
week
at
first
because
there
was
so
much
to
tell
but
that
now
since
things
had
settled
down
and
i
did
n
t
have
so
much
to
say
i
write
about
once
a
week
he
answered
that
there
was
just
as
much
to
say
now
as
there
ever
was
and
told
me
to
write
twice
a
week
or
he
d
know
the
reason
why
then
i
went
to
bed
and
had
a
chill
and
that
s
how
a
whole
day
was
spent
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
twelve
at
night
the
next
morning
i
woke
up
with
a
very
bad
sore
throat
and
a
stiff
neck
and
pains
all
over
duggie
and
berri
made
me
send
for
a
doctor
and
signed
off
for
me
at
the
office
i
can
t
imagine
how
i
caught
cold
unless
perhaps
it
was
from
wearing
that
wet
shirt
i
was
very
sick
for
about
three
days
and
just
sick
for
three
or
four
days
more
when
berri
signed
off
for
me
at
the
office
the
college
doctor
bustled
around
to
my
room
at
noon
to
see
what
was
the
matter
his
motives
in
doing
this
are
somewhat
mixed
i
believe
he
has
not
only
the
health
but
the
veracity
of
the
undergraduate
very
much
at
heart
if
you
are
laid
up
of
course
he
has
to
know
about
it
and
if
you
are
n
t
well
enough
to
attend
lectures
but
manage
with
a
heroic
effort
to
go
skating
he
likes
to
know
about
that
too
of
course
you
haven
t
measles
duggie
said
when
he
came
in
a
few
minutes
after
tush
had
gone
but
equally
of
course
he
said
you
had
n
t
he
yes
he
did
i
answered
dismally
for
he
had
told
me
this
at
considerable
length
and
i
remembered
that
measles
a
good
many
years
before
had
almost
been
the
end
of
me
well
s
a
relief
duggie
went
on
cheerfully
you
may
have
all
sorts
of
things
but
it
s
a
cinch
that
you
have
n
t
measles
tush
is
a
conservative
old
soul
he
always
gambles
on
measles
and
of
course
every
now
and
then
he
wins
it
pleases
him
immensely
he
usually
celebrates
his
success
by
writing
a
paper
on
the
university
s
health
and
getting
it
printed
in
the
graduates
magazine
when
the
other
real
he
found
that
i
was
threatened
with
pneumonia
oh
i
had
a
perfectly
miserable
time
of
it
at
first
the
feeling
dreadfully
all
over
and
not
being
able
to
breathe
was
bad
enough
but
i
think
the
and
the
worrying
about
mamma
were
worse
i
was
afraid
all
the
time
that
she
would
hear
although
i
could
n
t
imagine
how
that
would
be
possible
and
then
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
lay
awake
hoping
and
praying
that
she
hear
and
leave
for
cambridge
by
the
next
train
i
don
t
suppose
i
realized
just
then
how
wonderfully
good
duggie
and
berri
and
chester
were
to
me
duggie
and
berri
took
turns
in
sitting
up
all
night
and
putting
flannel
soaked
in
hot
on
my
chest
ugh
how
i
loathe
the
smell
of
mustard
and
when
they
had
to
go
to
lectures
during
the
day
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
cut
a
great
many
of
them
chester
would
come
in
and
hem
endless
by
the
window
berri
says
that
he
ceased
to
worry
about
me
from
the
time
i
looked
over
at
chester
after
about
half
an
hour
s
silence
and
exclaimed
sew
some
more
with
the
crisscross
pattern
i
m
tired
of
those
dingy
white
ones
as
i
began
to
get
better
i
appreciated
how
much
trouble
i
d
given
them
all
and
tried
to
thank
them
but
berri
said
why
your
illness
has
been
a
perfect
to
me
i
ve
done
more
grinding
lately
between
midnight
and
six
in
the
morning
than
i
ever
thought
would
be
possible
i
ve
caught
up
with
almost
everything
and
duggie
stopped
me
with
but
if
it
had
n
t
been
berri
and
i
it
would
have
been
someone
we
re
very
glad
it
was
n
t
old
chester
is
a
jewel
i
didn
t
pay
much
attention
to
her
at
first
but
was
just
glad
to
know
she
was
in
the
room
later
however
when
i
began
to
want
to
get
up
and
she
devoted
the
whole
of
her
marvellous
art
to
keeping
me
amused
i
appreciated
her
she
is
wonderful
i
was
going
to
assert
that
she
inspires
the
kind
of
affection
one
can
t
help
feeling
for
a
person
who
is
all
heart
and
no
intelligence
but
that
somehow
misses
the
mark
she
has
of
it
s
different
and
before
my
recovery
was
complete
i
began
to
wonder
if
it
wasn
t
the
only
kind
that
is
after
all
worth
while
for
it
s
the
kind
with
which
books
and
newspapers
and
going
a
journey
and
other
mechanical
aids
have
nothing
to
do
perhaps
i
should
concede
something
to
the
influence
of
foreign
travel
as
there
was
a
very
memorable
expedition
to
goshen
in
new
york
state
some
time
in
the
early
sixties
chester
s
intelligence
gushes
undefiled
from
the
rock
and
then
flows
along
in
a
limpid
ungrammatical
stream
that
soothes
at
first
and
then
enslaves
her
gift
for
narrative
of
the
detailed
photographic
new
england
variety
positively
mary
and
i
am
perhaps
the
greatest
living
male
authority
on
what
berri
calls
cronique
of
cambridge
one
of
her
studies
in
the
life
of
the
town
forty
years
ago
it
was
a
sort
of
epic
trilogy
that
lasted
all
morning
and
afternoon
and
part
of
the
evening
with
intermissions
for
luncheon
and
dinner
i
mean
to
write
some
time
for
the
advocate
it
all
leads
up
to
the
new
year
s
eve
on
which
old
burlap
passed
away
but
it
includes
several
new
and
startling
theories
as
to
the
real
cause
of
the
civil
war
an
impartial
account
of
the
war
itself
a
magnificent
tribute
to
the
late
general
butler
a
description
of
chester
s
wedding
gifts
and
floral
tributes
displayed
on
that
occasion
together
with
a
dreamy
surmise
as
to
their
probable
cost
brief
history
of
religion
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
who
is
at
times
assailed
by
doubt
who
doesn
t
make
a
practice
of
rushin
around
town
tellin
folks
who
d
only
be
too
glad
to
have
it
to
say
this
last
i
assumed
to
be
a
thrust
at
mis
buckson
spirited
word
picture
of
the
festivities
that
took
place
when
cambridge
celebrated
its
fiftieth
anniversary
as
a
city
and
at
the
end
a
brilliant
comparison
between
cambridge
and
goshen
in
new
york
state
there
was
i
believe
some
mention
of
the
passing
away
of
old
burlap
on
new
year
s
eve
but
of
this
i
am
not
sure
one
thing
i
discovered
that
rather
astonished
me
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
locality
that
berri
in
one
of
his
themes
called
a
cold
of
erudition
and
that
chester
doesn
t
know
how
to
read
i
never
would
have
found
it
out
but
for
an
embarrassing
little
miscalculation
on
her
part
in
the
method
by
which
until
then
she
had
delightfully
concealed
the
fact
more
than
once
while
i
was
sick
she
sat
by
the
lamp
apparently
enjoying
the
evening
paper
that
duggie
subscribes
to
and
i
had
n
t
the
slightest
suspicion
that
she
was
probably
holding
it
upside
down
even
when
i
would
ask
her
what
the
news
was
and
she
would
reply
oh
papers
they
re
every
one
of
em
alike
they
don
t
seem
to
be
any
news
to
em
i
don
t
see
why
you
young
gentlemen
waste
your
good
money
em
often
on
the
way
upstairs
she
takes
the
letters
that
the
postman
leaves
between
the
banisters
in
the
little
hall
below
and
manages
to
distribute
them
with
more
or
less
accuracy
i
ve
got
somethin
for
you
and
it
s
from
your
mother
too
you
naughty
little
man
you
is
her
usual
way
of
handing
me
a
communication
from
mamma
i
did
n
t
realise
until
the
other
day
that
as
mamma
s
letters
always
came
in
the
same
kind
of
envelopes
it
doesn
t
take
a
chirographic
expert
to
tell
whom
they
are
from
nor
did
i
recall
that
when
chester
appears
with
a
whole
handful
of
things
she
invariably
stops
short
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
artlessly
exclaims
well
now
if
that
does
n
t
beat
all
here
i
ve
climbed
up
them
steep
stairs
again
and
forgotten
my
specs
who
s
gettin
all
these
letters
anyhow
a
few
mornings
ago
however
they
let
me
sit
up
for
the
first
time
chester
appeared
with
two
letters
one
of
them
was
unmistakably
but
the
other
was
white
and
oblong
and
she
paused
at
the
door
as
if
about
to
examine
the
address
and
then
suddenly
if
i
ain
t
the
most
careless
woman
in
the
world
she
said
i
ve
gone
and
brought
up
the
letters
again
and
but
just
at
this
point
we
both
became
aware
that
her
spectacles
were
dangling
in
her
other
hand
they
not
only
dangled
but
they
seemed
to
me
a
moment
later
to
dangle
almost
spitefully
for
chester
s
worn
cheeks
became
very
pink
she
looked
at
the
spectacles
and
at
the
white
envelope
and
at
me
then
she
said
with
a
sort
of
wistful
lightness
maybe
you
can
make
it
out
your
eyes
are
younger
than
mine
i
never
seen
such
a
letter
it
s
s
so
flung
together
like
it
t
it
i
agreed
hastily
as
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
receive
a
letter
from
papa
with
the
address
in
just
as
i
thought
would
happen
mamma
heard
i
was
sick
and
was
of
course
very
much
worried
dick
has
never
come
near
me
and
whom
i
ve
only
seen
twice
on
the
street
since
college
the
fact
of
my
illness
in
a
letter
home
i
suppose
he
did
it
in
a
despairing
effort
to
make
his
sentences
reach
the
middle
of
page
two
of
course
benton
had
to
throw
a
shawl
around
her
meddling
old
back
and
waddle
across
the
street
to
our
house
to
find
out
the
latest
news
and
as
there
had
n
t
been
any
news
mamma
s
letter
to
me
expressed
a
state
of
mind
but
i
fixed
her
and
incidentally
dick
benton
with
a
telegram
by
the
way
i
really
must
speak
to
mamma
about
her
recent
letters
to
me
mildred
has
been
away
from
home
and
as
mamma
writes
very
regularly
to
both
of
us
she
often
refers
to
things
she
remembers
having
written
to
somebody
but
without
pausing
to
consider
how
maddening
they
are
when
the
somebody
doesn
t
happen
to
be
myself
from
her
last
for
instance
i
gleaned
these
interesting
items
without
having
the
vaguest
idea
what
they
belong
to
your
father
and
i
have
just
got
back
from
the
funeral
i
suppose
when
one
arrives
at
such
a
great
age
death
is
a
relief
but
it
is
always
solemn
is
n
t
it
nice
about
the
tilestons
i
don
t
know
a
purely
impersonal
ve
been
so
pleased
they
ve
struggled
so
long
and
so
bravely
and
now
it
seems
as
if
their
ship
had
come
in
at
last
of
course
i
should
n
t
care
to
spend
so
much
time
in
south
america
myself
guatemala
in
south
america
is
n
t
it
but
they
all
seem
delighted
at
the
prospect
now
would
n
t
that
jar
you
my
acquaintances
generally
found
out
that
i
was
sick
about
the
time
that
duggie
and
berri
and
chester
discharged
me
so
to
speak
as
well
i
could
n
t
go
out
and
the
doctor
made
me
stay
in
bed
longer
than
was
really
necessary
as
the
bottom
of
the
furnace
fell
to
pieces
one
morning
and
it
was
impossible
to
heat
the
house
for
several
days
but
i
felt
pretty
well
by
that
time
as
i
say
there
was
all
at
once
a
ripple
of
interest
among
my
friends
over
the
fact
that
i
was
sick
they
were
awfully
kind
and
came
to
my
room
from
early
in
the
after
late
at
night
when
they
would
drop
in
on
their
way
back
from
the
theatre
my
desk
was
a
perfect
of
illustrated
magazines
and
funny
papers
and
i
had
left
in
my
probably
the
queerest
collection
of
novels
that
was
ever
assembled
outside
of
a
city
hospital
duggie
had
a
fit
over
them
and
as
he
read
out
the
titles
one
evening
he
kept
exclaiming
what
oh
what
are
the
children
coming
to
the
only
volume
that
was
n
t
fiction
was
a
thing
called
the
statesman
s
year
book
and
was
brought
by
a
queer
sort
of
chap
who
is
very
much
interested
in
sociology
i
know
him
pretty
well
so
after
i
thanked
him
i
could
n
t
help
saying
what
on
earth
did
you
lug
this
thing
up
here
for
looks
like
an
almanac
to
which
he
replied
well
it
s
darned
interesting
i
can
tell
you
until
i
got
it
i
never
knew
for
instance
how
many
quarts
of
alcohol
per
head
were
consumed
annually
in
finland
although
duggie
did
n
t
say
anything
i
don
t
think
he
was
particularly
pleased
at
the
fellows
dropping
in
so
often
and
staying
so
long
they
played
cards
a
lot
and
smoked
all
the
time
until
you
could
hardly
see
across
the
room
and
sometimes
when
night
came
i
felt
rather
tired
and
my
eyes
and
throat
hurt
a
good
deal
but
i
confess
i
liked
it
even
if
duggie
and
chester
did
n
t
only
one
change
of
any
importance
took
place
while
i
was
laid
up
berri
s
icelandic
been
removed
from
our
midst
i
was
aware
that
an
unusual
spirit
of
peace
and
order
reigned
in
the
house
as
soon
as
i
began
to
be
about
once
more
but
i
attributed
it
vaguely
to
the
chastening
influence
of
my
illness
however
one
morning
when
on
my
way
to
a
lecture
i
remembered
that
i
had
noticed
my
best
hat
lying
on
a
chair
in
my
study
as
i
came
away
and
ran
back
to
save
it
from
being
eaten
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
n
t
seen
saga
for
days
so
while
berri
and
i
were
strolling
home
from
luncheon
i
asked
him
what
had
happened
he
s
poor
old
darling
said
berri
i
hate
to
speak
of
it
he
was
n
t
stolen
or
run
over
or
anything
was
he
i
asked
sympathetically
for
now
that
saga
was
no
longer
an
hourly
source
of
anxiety
and
conflict
i
felt
reasonably
safe
in
expressing
some
regret
did
he
run
away
no
he
did
n
t
leave
me
berri
answered
sadly
i
gave
him
up
you
found
out
that
there
is
a
law
against
bringing
them
into
the
state
they
always
go
mad
as
soon
as
the
warm
weather
comes
so
i
gave
him
to
one
of
the
little
cabot
girls
on
her
birthday
she
was
awfully
pleased
i
am
rather
worried
over
something
that
i
got
into
lately
without
stopping
to
think
how
much
it
might
involve
berri
and
that
tall
spook
named
ranny
that
he
met
at
fleetwood
s
wednesday
evening
struck
up
quite
an
intimacy
not
long
ago
although
i
can
t
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
they
managed
it
he
isn
t
a
freshman
as
we
thought
but
a
sophomore
berri
was
waiting
in
a
bookstore
in
town
one
day
to
go
to
a
matinée
with
a
fellow
who
did
n
t
turn
up
and
while
he
was
standing
there
ranny
came
in
and
began
to
drive
the
clerks
insane
over
some
greek
and
sanscrit
books
he
had
ordered
weeks
before
and
that
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
berri
looked
on
for
a
while
and
as
his
friend
did
n
t
come
and
it
was
getting
late
and
n
t
like
to
waste
the
extra
ticket
he
invited
ranny
to
go
with
him
well
they
not
only
went
to
the
matinée
they
dined
in
town
together
and
went
again
to
another
show
in
the
evening
between
the
acts
ranny
explained
to
him
just
wherein
the
wit
of
the
girl
from
oskosh
differed
from
the
comedies
of
aristophanes
and
berri
says
that
before
they
parted
he
had
learned
all
about
the
greek
drama
from
a
to
izzard
since
then
ranny
has
been
to
our
house
several
times
and
although
berri
likes
him
he
usually
finds
after
about
an
hour
that
he
isn
t
equal
to
the
intellectual
strain
so
he
lures
ranny
into
my
room
and
then
gracefully
fades
away
now
i
like
ranny
too
he
has
in
his
ponderous
bespectacled
way
an
enthusiasm
for
several
bespectacled
ponderous
subjects
that
is
simply
irresistible
one
of
them
is
egyptology
and
the
study
of
hieroglyphics
of
course
i
don
t
know
anything
about
this
any
more
than
berri
knew
about
the
greek
drama
as
much
even
for
he
did
at
least
pretend
to
play
a
pagan
instrument
of
some
kind
in
a
play
they
gave
at
school
once
while
a
frenchman
behind
the
scenes
toodled
away
on
a
flute
but
when
ranny
gets
to
talking
about
dynasties
and
cartouches
and
draws
fascinating
little
pictures
of
gods
and
goddesses
named
ma
and
pa
and
explains
how
the
whole
business
was
deciphered
by
means
of
a
piece
of
stone
somebody
picked
up
in
the
mud
one
day
regular
old
sherlock
holmes
he
must
have
been
simply
can
t
help
being
carried
away
and
wishing
you
could
discover
something
on
your
own
account
he
talked
so
much
about
it
and
made
it
all
seem
so
real
and
important
that
one
day
when
he
exclaimed
and
the
mystery
is
that
the
university
ignores
this
it
i
really
felt
that
the
faculty
was
treating
us
rather
shabbily
and
that
we
were
n
t
somehow
getting
our
money
s
worth
we
talked
the
matter
over
very
seriously
and
decided
at
last
that
it
could
n
t
be
stinginess
on
the
part
of
the
corporation
why
should
it
allow
courses
in
higher
mathematics
and
philosophy
and
italian
literature
to
which
only
three
or
four
fellows
went
if
it
wanted
to
save
the
pennies
it
was
more
likely
just
ignorance
of
the
importance
of
hieroglyphics
and
the
growing
demand
for
a
thorough
course
of
it
we
probably
could
get
a
course
all
right
if
we
showed
them
how
some
of
us
feel
about
it
ranny
mused
there
s
a
chap
in
latin
who
d
join
i
ve
seen
that
man
with
the
long
sandy
beard
have
n
t
you
he
tries
almost
everything
the
person
ranny
referred
to
did
n
t
seem
very
promising
to
me
we
sleep
next
each
other
in
a
history
course
he
never
wears
a
necktie
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
there
were
a
lot
of
dead
maple
leaves
tangled
up
in
his
beard
no
one
seems
to
know
why
he
is
here
well
that
makes
three
right
away
ranny
declared
enthusiastically
perhaps
berrisford
will
join
but
even
if
he
does
n
t
three
s
enough
the
very
next
morning
after
this
ranny
appeared
to
say
he
was
going
to
consult
professor
pallas
about
the
new
course
and
wanted
me
to
go
along
and
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
this
seemed
a
little
sudden
to
me
and
i
said
that
perhaps
i
ought
to
consult
my
adviser
before
taking
up
a
new
study
as
i
had
n
t
done
particularly
well
in
the
old
ones
however
ranny
said
that
my
adviser
ought
to
be
thankful
at
my
showing
so
much
interest
and
public
spirit
so
we
went
over
to
professor
pallas
s
little
private
room
in
sever
he
was
very
glad
to
see
us
and
when
ranny
began
to
explain
the
subject
of
our
coming
his
old
eyes
just
glittered
he
kept
smiling
to
himself
and
nodding
his
head
in
assent
and
once
when
ranny
paused
for
breath
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
exclaiming
i
predicted
it
then
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
paced
excitedly
up
and
down
the
room
ranny
was
of
course
tremendously
encouraged
and
i
was
somewhat
horrified
a
moment
later
to
have
him
turn
toward
me
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
declare
my
friend
wood
feels
this
weakness
in
the
curriculum
more
perhaps
than
any
of
us
for
long
before
he
entered
college
with
the
purpose
of
specialising
in
the
subject
he
surrounded
himself
with
a
collection
of
egyptian
antiquities
that
far
excels
anything
of
the
kind
on
this
side
of
the
british
museum
he
was
referring
in
his
intense
way
to
a
handful
of
imitation
scarabs
and
a
old
mummified
parrot
that
uncle
peter
brought
home
from
his
trip
up
the
nile
i
had
indiscreetly
mentioned
them
one
afternoon
we
are
sure
of
four
earnest
workers
and
there
are
no
doubt
many
more
now
the
thing
that
worries
me
about
all
this
is
that
professor
pallas
seemed
so
gratified
and
eager
to
help
the
cause
his
attitude
toward
us
was
that
of
a
scholar
among
scholars
calling
unto
deep
he
said
that
he
would
love
to
conduct
a
course
in
hieroglyphics
himself
but
feared
he
was
n
t
competent
as
he
had
merely
taken
up
the
subject
as
a
kind
of
recreation
at
odd
moments
during
the
last
six
or
eight
years
he
could
n
t
recall
any
one
in
the
united
states
who
was
competent
in
fact
but
he
knew
of
a
splendid
authority
in
germany
the
man
for
the
place
he
would
speak
to
the
president
about
him
at
the
next
faculty
meeting
ranny
and
i
thanked
him
profusely
and
that
at
present
is
where
the
matter
stands
i
wake
up
in
the
night
sometimes
positively
cold
at
the
thought
of
having
added
hieroglyphics
to
my
other
worries
think
of
a
course
for
which
you
could
n
t
buy
typewritten
notes
course
the
very
lectures
of
which
would
be
in
german
course
so
terrible
that
no
one
in
the
united
states
would
dare
undertake
to
tutor
you
in
it
when
you
got
stuck
the
christmas
holidays
are
almost
here
but
it
has
not
been
decided
yet
whether
or
not
i
am
to
spend
them
at
home
mildred
is
still
gadding
about
and
papa
may
have
to
go
to
new
york
on
business
if
he
does
mamma
will
no
doubt
go
with
him
and
i
ll
join
them
there
and
we
ll
all
have
thin
slabs
of
christmas
turkey
surrounded
by
bird
at
a
hotel
berri
has
invited
me
to
spend
the
vacation
with
him
his
mother
is
living
in
washington
this
winter
but
as
he
remarks
dolefully
every
now
and
then
that
he
has
to
stay
in
cambridge
to
write
a
thesis
that
is
due
immediately
after
the
holidays
i
don
t
see
how
he
means
to
manage
he
s
been
putting
off
that
thesis
from
day
to
day
until
i
don
t
see
how
he
can
possibly
do
all
the
reading
and
writing
and
it
necessitates
i
ve
tried
to
get
him
started
once
or
twice
but
he
has
merely
groaned
and
said
you
re
a
nice
one
to
preach
industry
are
n
t
you
so
i
ve
given
up
well
it
s
none
of
my
business
if
he
gets
fired
from
the
course
i
might
have
spared
myself
my
anxiety
in
regard
to
the
course
in
hieroglyphics
my
adviser
overtook
me
in
the
yard
a
day
or
so
after
our
interview
with
professor
pallas
and
after
walking
along
with
me
for
a
while
he
said
well
wood
i
m
glad
to
see
you
looking
about
as
usual
i
had
almost
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
d
gone
stark
mad
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
and
it
seems
that
old
pallas
had
made
a
speech
at
a
faculty
meeting
in
which
he
declared
that
the
deep
and
interest
throughout
the
undergraduate
body
in
the
subject
of
egyptology
had
reached
a
climax
that
demanded
a
course
of
some
kind
he
was
very
eloquent
and
caused
a
good
deal
of
mild
excitement
then
some
one
got
up
and
asked
who
were
concerned
in
the
movement
and
pallas
after
fumbling
in
his
side
pocket
finally
produced
a
memorandum
and
said
the
names
of
those
imbued
with
a
spirit
for
serious
archaeological
research
are
many
but
i
think
that
the
youth
who
by
his
zeal
in
collecting
and
preserving
valuable
antiquities
has
done
more
than
any
one
else
to
further
this
study
among
his
fellows
is
thomas
wood
of
the
class
of
but
the
poor
old
man
did
n
t
get
any
further
my
adviser
says
for
everybody
in
the
room
began
to
roar
and
the
meeting
broke
up
in
confusion
well
that
s
off
my
mind
anyhow
although
i
don
t
see
why
they
should
have
taken
it
the
way
they
did
there
s
nothing
so
very
extraordinary
in
acquiring
a
love
for
study
when
that
s
what
you
re
supposed
to
come
here
for
berri
and
i
discovered
the
most
fascinating
little
place
the
other
evening
we
had
been
in
town
all
afternoon
on
the
trail
of
an
express
package
of
berri
s
that
had
been
lost
for
days
and
were
running
along
tremont
street
on
the
way
to
the
cambridge
car
when
berri
suddenly
stopped
in
front
of
a
sort
of
alley
and
clutched
me
from
the
other
end
came
the
sound
of
music
harp
a
flute
and
a
violin
playing
one
of
those
neapolitan
yayayama
songs
that
always
somehow
make
you
feel
as
if
you
d
been
abroad
even
when
you
ve
never
been
nearer
naples
than
waving
to
your
sister
from
a
north
german
lloyd
dock
in
hoboken
let
s
go
see
what
it
is
berri
said
so
we
skipped
to
the
other
end
of
the
alley
and
found
a
brightly
lighted
little
restaurant
with
the
music
wailing
away
in
the
vestibule
we
stood
listening
for
a
time
and
watching
the
people
who
went
in
they
all
stopped
to
peer
through
a
glass
door
and
then
after
a
moment
of
indecision
passed
a
flight
of
steep
stairs
berri
of
course
could
n
t
be
satisfied
until
he
had
solved
the
mystery
of
the
glass
door
and
it
was
n
t
long
before
we
were
doing
just
as
every
one
else
did
we
saw
a
long
narrow
room
with
three
rows
of
little
tables
reaching
from
end
to
end
the
walls
were
covered
with
gay
frescos
of
some
kind
i
could
n
t
make
them
out
the
tobacco
smoke
was
so
thick
waiters
were
tearing
in
and
out
among
the
tables
flower
girls
were
wandering
up
and
down
with
of
roses
and
carnations
for
sale
and
everybody
was
laughing
and
gesticulating
and
having
such
a
good
time
apparently
music
was
so
shrill
and
the
clatter
of
dishes
so
incessant
berri
and
i
turned
and
gazed
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
after
all
these
years
we
ve
found
it
at
last
but
a
moment
later
we
realized
why
the
people
we
had
seen
go
in
had
after
a
glance
turned
away
and
climbed
the
stairs
all
the
tables
were
occupied
i
think
we
must
have
looked
as
dissatisfied
as
the
others
for
we
felt
that
nothing
upstairs
could
equal
the
scene
we
had
just
discovered
and
we
were
right
the
upper
rooms
were
comparatively
empty
and
quiet
and
rather
dreary
so
we
came
down
again
and
were
about
to
take
a
farewell
look
and
start
for
home
when
berri
with
his
nose
flattened
against
the
glass
suddenly
exclaimed
saved
saved
and
pushing
open
the
door
made
his
way
across
the
room
who
should
be
there
but
fleetwood
dining
alone
at
a
table
in
the
corner
berri
after
shaking
hands
with
him
beckoned
to
me
and
in
a
moment
we
had
both
seated
ourselves
at
fleetwood
s
table
this
is
almost
as
nice
as
if
we
d
really
been
invited
isn
t
it
said
berri
in
his
easy
way
you
know
we
were
just
on
the
point
of
giving
up
and
going
home
why
didn
t
you
go
upstairs
fleetwood
inquired
he
pretended
all
through
dinner
that
we
had
spoiled
his
evening
it
is
n
t
too
late
even
now
he
suggested
it
s
much
nicer
up
there
there
s
more
air
there
s
plenty
of
air
but
no
atmosphere
berri
answered
this
is
what
we
enjoy
he
added
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
i
m
glad
you
like
my
bohemia
fleetwood
quavered
oh
bohemia
s
all
right
replied
berri
bohemia
would
be
it
weren
t
for
the
bohemians
what
are
bohemians
i
asked
for
i
d
often
heard
people
called
that
without
understanding
just
what
it
meant
bohemians
berri
repeated
why
bohemians
are
perfectly
horrid
things
who
exist
exclusively
on
welsh
rabbits
and
use
the
word
conventional
as
a
term
of
reproach
my
aunt
knows
hundreds
of
them
i
wrote
a
paper
once
on
what
is
a
bohemian
fleetwood
put
in
if
you
would
really
like
to
of
course
you
would
n
t
he
broke
off
sadly
no
one
does
any
more
you
clever
boys
know
everything
before
you
come
oh
fleetwood
please
let
us
read
your
paper
we
both
begged
him
enthusiastically
i
think
he
was
a
little
flattered
for
we
would
n
t
allow
him
to
talk
about
anything
else
until
he
had
promised
to
tell
me
where
i
could
find
his
article
berri
however
he
refused
absolutely
and
made
me
promise
in
turn
not
to
let
him
know
where
to
look
for
it
and
never
to
quote
from
it
in
berri
s
presence
i
know
him
he
muttered
dolefully
i
know
these
memories
that
turn
again
and
rend
you
i
m
an
old
man
habe
and
well
we
had
a
most
delightful
dinner
fleetwood
when
he
saw
that
he
was
n
t
going
to
get
rid
of
us
cheered
up
and
made
himself
very
agreeable
he
can
be
charming
when
he
wants
to
be
he
and
berri
did
most
of
the
talking
although
his
remarks
as
a
rule
were
addressed
to
me
the
fact
is
he
likes
me
because
i
m
sympathetic
and
a
good
listener
but
berri
he
finds
vastly
more
interesting
berri
has
travelled
such
a
lot
and
besides
he
has
the
knack
i
haven
t
it
at
all
of
being
able
to
discuss
things
of
which
he
knows
nothing
in
a
way
that
commands
not
only
attention
but
respect
for
instance
they
got
into
a
perfectly
absorbing
squabble
over
the
novelist
henry
james
in
which
fleetwood
deplored
and
berri
defended
what
fleetwood
called
his
later
manner
fleetwood
ended
up
with
i
ve
read
everything
he
s
ever
of
them
many
times
i
wrote
a
paper
on
him
for
lesper
s
not
long
ago
but
i
could
n
t
conscientiously
come
to
any
other
conclusion
to
which
berri
replied
as
he
smiled
indulgently
to
himself
and
broke
a
bit
of
bread
with
his
slim
brown
fingers
i
often
wonder
if
you
people
over
here
who
write
things
about
harry
james
from
time
to
time
really
comprehend
the
man
at
that
i
say
james
the
man
not
james
the
style
c
est
l
you
know
is
n
t
it
bossuet
who
tells
us
that
no
it
is
n
t
said
fleetwood
rather
peevishly
it
s
he
probably
stole
it
from
the
latin
virum
fleetwood
of
course
knows
what
he
s
talking
about
but
nevertheless
i
could
see
that
berri
s
general
air
of
being
foreign
and
detached
and
knowing
james
from
the
rather
from
the
other
him
and
as
for
me
i
was
simply
paralyzed
for
i
could
have
testified
under
oath
that
berri
had
never
read
a
word
of
henry
james
in
his
life
and
that
he
d
never
laid
eyes
on
the
man
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
afterward
and
asked
him
how
he
dared
to
do
such
things
have
you
ever
read
anything
by
you
ever
seen
harry
james
the
man
as
you
called
him
i
inquired
no
of
course
not
berri
answered
what
difference
does
it
make
but
you
went
on
as
if
you
knew
more
about
him
than
even
fleetwood
and
i
think
that
toward
the
end
fleetwood
almost
thought
you
did
himself
berri
shrugged
after
trying
to
recall
the
conversation
that
was
merely
what
an
old
frump
of
a
woman
said
at
my
aunt
s
one
day
when
i
dropped
in
for
luncheon
she
and
aunt
josephine
gabbled
and
gabbled
and
never
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
me
and
although
they
were
both
unusually
tiresome
i
suppose
i
could
n
t
avoid
remembering
some
of
the
things
they
said
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
dwell
any
longer
on
that
particular
topic
with
fleetwood
even
if
my
life
had
depended
on
it
because
that
day
at
luncheon
just
as
my
aunt
s
friend
got
started
on
james
the
man
i
happened
to
glance
up
and
notice
that
she
was
wearing
an
entirely
different
kind
of
wig
from
the
ratty
old
thing
she
d
flourished
in
before
she
went
abroad
she
had
brought
back
a
new
one
that
it
was
an
architectural
marvel
it
looked
like
the
dome
of
a
mosque
and
covered
her
whole
head
from
eyebrows
to
neck
with
little
places
for
her
ears
to
peek
through
it
hypnotized
me
all
through
luncheon
and
i
never
heard
a
word
about
james
the
man
of
course
when
i
got
that
far
with
fleetwood
i
had
to
change
the
subject
don
t
you
remember
that
we
began
to
discuss
bernhardt
s
conception
of
hamlet
rather
abruptly
i
ll
never
trust
that
old
woman
making
the
mistake
about
buffon
why
she
s
positively
illiterate
fleetwood
told
me
a
lot
about
mazuret
s
the
name
of
the
made
me
glad
that
we
had
come
across
it
accidentally
it
out
for
ourselves
it
s
very
famous
all
sorts
of
and
painters
and
actors
and
exiled
to
make
a
kind
of
headquarters
of
it
and
dine
there
whenever
they
happened
to
be
in
town
fleetwood
has
been
going
there
for
years
and
always
sits
at
the
same
table
that
s
the
proper
thing
to
do
you
must
have
a
favorite
table
and
when
you
come
in
and
find
it
occupied
you
must
scowl
and
shrug
and
complain
to
the
waiters
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
place
is
going
to
the
dogs
then
everybody
in
the
room
takes
it
for
granted
that
you
re
a
writer
or
a
painter
an
actor
or
an
exiled
nobleman
and
looks
interested
and
sympathetic
we
saw
several
performances
of
this
kind
but
the
place
of
course
isn
t
what
it
used
to
be
i
m
seven
or
eight
years
too
late
as
usual
some
of
the
poets
have
become
very
means
fleetwood
says
that
they
re
doing
newspaper
work
in
new
york
some
of
the
painters
and
actors
are
beyond
the
reach
of
means
that
they
re
dead
and
some
of
the
noblemen
are
confident
that
their
respective
governments
are
about
to
recall
them
to
posts
of
responsibility
and
means
that
they
are
in
jail
it
was
more
entertaining
fleetwood
says
in
the
days
of
leontine
shrewd
vivacious
businesslike
frenchwoman
who
when
monsieur
mazuret
became
too
ill
and
madame
too
old
used
to
make
change
and
scold
the
waiters
and
say
good
evening
to
you
and
whose
gingham
fitted
her
like
models
from
paquin
it
was
leontine
who
brought
back
the
wonderful
from
paris
through
the
glass
door
it
looked
like
a
painting
that
represents
a
hunting
scene
with
willowy
ladies
in
preposterous
pink
velvet
and
waving
plumes
and
gentlemen
blowing
tasselled
horns
and
hounds
and
plunging
through
a
perfectly
impenetrable
forest
whose
improbable
luxuriance
berri
brilliantly
accounted
for
by
saying
that
it
was
evidently
paris
green
attend
tell
you
something
leontine
used
to
say
confidentially
when
the
evening
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
but
one
or
two
stragglers
were
left
in
the
these
stay
so
long
sometimes
i
tell
to
them
that
they
must
go
but
will
not
go
and
they
stay
and
they
stay
and
they
stay
and
all
at
once
you
call
begin
to
move
the
gallop
the
scream
of
laughing
the
make
toot
toot
toot
tooooo
the
deer
carried
away
by
these
midnight
memories
leontine
would
become
a
galloping
horse
a
screaming
lady
a
master
of
hounds
a
savage
pack
and
a
terrified
monarch
of
the
at
once
then
overpowered
by
the
weird
horror
of
it
she
would
cover
her
face
with
her
apron
and
run
coquettishly
as
if
for
protection
to
another
table
there
was
another
description
of
a
regular
it
must
have
one
afternoon
overtook
madame
and
leontine
in
the
place
de
la
madeleine
leontine
personifying
the
truly
gallic
lightning
reels
covered
with
hands
thunder
fingers
in
open
and
emitting
groans
rain
hissing
back
from
the
asphalt
in
a
million
silver
bubbles
skirts
exit
to
kitchen
bringing
this
incoherent
scene
vividly
before
one
was
worth
one
s
eating
a
worse
dinner
fleetwood
says
than
the
dinner
at
mazuret
s
but
monsieur
is
dead
and
madame
just
dried
up
and
blew
away
and
leontine
is
married
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
enjoyed
a
dinner
so
the
place
isn
t
what
it
used
to
be
while
fleetwood
was
telling
me
all
this
i
noticed
that
berri
called
one
of
the
waiters
and
spoke
to
him
in
french
i
don
t
know
what
he
said
as
he
talked
very
anyhow
it
did
n
t
sound
much
like
the
kind
of
french
i
ve
been
used
to
the
waiter
disappeared
and
in
half
an
hour
or
so
a
messenger
boy
came
in
and
gave
berri
a
little
envelope
which
he
put
in
his
pocket
without
saying
anything
then
when
we
had
finished
dinner
and
were
just
about
to
push
away
from
the
table
berri
exclaimed
now
we
ll
all
go
to
the
theatre
my
dear
young
man
if
you
could
see
the
work
i
have
to
do
this
night
fleetwood
protested
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
express
mountains
of
uncorrected
themes
you
would
realize
for
once
in
your
life
what
work
really
is
but
i
have
the
tickets
berri
explained
and
he
brought
forth
the
little
envelope
that
the
messenger
boy
had
given
him
fleetwood
answered
decidedly
and
started
for
the
door
but
berri
detained
him
by
inflicting
our
company
on
you
we
ve
spoiled
the
evening
for
you
i
know
but
you
won
t
spoil
it
for
me
by
depriving
us
of
yours
he
begged
in
his
engaging
way
sweet
invocation
of
a
child
most
pretty
and
pathetical
fleetwood
laughed
and
backed
into
the
vestibule
we
followed
and
surrounded
him
so
to
speak
each
taking
hold
of
an
arm
then
we
all
walked
through
the
alley
toward
tremont
street
fleetwood
quavering
apprehensively
from
time
to
time
now
you
ll
take
me
to
my
car
and
then
bid
me
adieu
like
two
good
boys
won
t
you
while
we
agreed
to
everything
he
said
and
clung
to
him
like
sheriffs
berri
was
giggling
hysterically
but
although
i
thought
the
situation
rather
amusing
i
did
n
t
see
anything
so
terribly
funny
about
it
until
we
got
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
fleetwood
stopped
then
i
noticed
that
in
addition
to
the
three
great
red
roses
that
berri
had
bought
for
our
fleetwood
had
a
fourth
one
with
a
long
flexible
stem
growing
apparently
out
of
the
top
of
his
head
he
was
so
unconscious
of
the
absurd
lanky
thing
nodding
solemnly
over
him
whenever
he
spoke
that
when
he
held
out
his
hand
exclaiming
tremulously
and
so
in
the
words
of
jessica
farewell
i
will
not
have
my
father
see
me
talk
with
thee
and
the
rose
emphasized
every
word
as
if
it
were
imitating
him
i
gave
an
uncontrollable
whoop
and
berri
doubled
up
on
a
doorstep
i
only
would
that
my
father
were
alive
at
the
present
moment
to
see
me
talking
with
thee
berri
gasped
i
don
t
know
anything
he
would
have
enjoyed
more
fleetwood
looked
hurt
and
mystified
and
vaguely
suspicious
and
he
stood
there
merely
long
enough
to
say
you
break
jests
as
braggarts
do
their
blades
which
god
be
thanked
hurt
then
as
berri
was
still
sitting
on
the
doorstep
and
i
was
leaning
against
the
wall
he
made
a
sudden
dash
for
the
other
side
of
the
street
we
caught
him
of
course
grasped
his
arms
once
more
and
walked
him
off
to
the
theatre
pretending
all
the
time
that
we
did
n
t
notice
his
struggles
and
how
furious
he
was
at
having
to
go
with
us
berri
kept
up
an
incessant
stream
of
conversation
saying
things
that
to
an
outsider
would
have
given
the
impression
that
the
was
fleetwood
s
and
that
we
were
the
ones
who
were
being
dragged
reluctantly
away
from
the
cambridge
car
just
before
we
got
to
the
theatre
the
solemn
rose
in
fleetwood
s
hat
toppled
over
and
dangled
against
his
face
this
also
we
pretended
not
to
see
and
as
we
had
him
firmly
by
the
arms
he
was
unable
to
reach
up
and
throw
it
away
so
we
made
a
spectacular
entrance
through
the
brightly
lighted
doorway
with
fleetwood
ineffectually
blowing
at
the
rose
and
shaking
his
head
like
an
angry
bull
a
party
of
four
or
five
had
been
unable
to
get
tickets
were
turning
away
from
the
as
we
appeared
and
they
naturally
stopped
to
look
at
us
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
last
straw
for
fleetwood
almost
tearfully
broke
out
with
you
dreadful
dreadful
boys
my
reputation
is
ruined
they
ll
think
i
ve
been
drinking
even
berri
began
to
see
that
we
had
gone
somewhat
far
for
he
plucked
the
rose
from
fleetwood
s
cheek
exclaiming
good
gracious
man
where
did
you
get
this
you
must
n
t
go
to
the
theatre
looking
that
way
just
because
bernhardt
plays
hamlet
is
no
reason
why
you
should
undertake
to
do
ophelia
and
then
he
threw
it
on
the
floor
fleetwood
rolled
his
eyes
hopelessly
well
we
never
got
home
until
almost
four
in
the
morning
a
man
whose
seat
was
behind
ours
at
the
play
tapped
fleetwood
on
the
shoulder
as
soon
as
we
had
sat
down
and
after
a
whispered
conversation
he
got
up
and
went
away
then
fleetwood
told
us
the
man
was
a
dramatic
acquaintance
of
had
been
sent
to
write
up
the
play
for
a
morning
paper
but
that
as
he
did
n
t
understand
french
and
was
n
t
much
of
a
shakespearian
scholar
and
wanted
to
go
to
a
progressive
peanut
party
in
west
roxbury
anyhow
he
had
asked
fleetwood
to
do
the
thing
for
him
fleetwood
used
to
be
on
a
paper
himself
and
was
delighted
to
renew
old
times
so
all
during
the
performance
he
made
notes
on
the
margin
of
his
program
and
chuckled
to
himself
the
occupation
i
think
diverted
his
mind
from
berri
and
me
and
helped
him
to
forgive
us
afterward
we
went
to
newspaper
row
and
waited
for
hours
in
a
bare
rather
dirty
little
room
while
fleetwood
standing
at
a
high
desk
under
an
electric
light
in
the
corner
wrote
his
review
he
spent
much
more
time
in
groaning
my
facility
is
hand
has
lost
its
cunning
than
in
actual
writing
by
the
time
he
was
ready
to
leave
we
were
all
famished
so
before
catching
the
owl
car
from
bowdoin
square
we
stopped
at
an
restaurant
that
fleetwood
used
to
patronize
when
he
was
a
reporter
and
had
buckwheat
cakes
and
maple
syrup
i
ve
never
tasted
anything
so
good
the
cambridge
car
was
interesting
but
fearful
it
was
jammed
with
people
and
i
wondered
where
so
many
could
have
come
from
that
hour
of
the
morning
they
could
n
t
all
have
been
dramatic
critics
the
majority
of
those
who
got
seats
went
sound
asleep
and
as
the
conductor
could
n
t
very
well
wake
them
up
at
every
street
he
found
out
beforehand
where
they
wanted
to
get
off
and
then
hung
little
tags
on
their
coats
that
told
their
destination
when
we
were
saying
to
fleetwood
in
the
square
berri
laughed
and
asked
have
you
decided
yet
what
you
re
going
to
do
to
me
fleetwood
i
know
you
would
like
to
give
me
e
on
my
thesis
but
i
don
t
think
i
deserve
quite
that
instead
of
answering
him
however
fleetwood
ran
away
exclaiming
don
t
talk
shop
t
talk
shop
berri
has
begun
to
get
awfully
scared
about
the
thesis
that
he
s
afraid
that
fleetwood
will
give
it
a
low
mark
but
because
it
does
n
t
look
at
present
as
if
there
would
be
anything
to
mark
at
all
i
found
him
in
his
room
the
other
day
with
a
pile
of
books
and
a
on
his
table
but
he
had
n
t
taken
a
note
and
his
attitude
was
one
of
utter
despair
of
course
he
can
t
possibly
write
it
unless
he
stays
here
during
the
holidays
for
they
begin
day
after
i
don
t
think
i
ve
had
a
pen
in
my
hand
except
when
i
wrote
a
note
to
berri
for
more
than
two
weeks
in
the
first
place
i
left
in
such
a
hurry
to
meet
the
family
in
new
york
that
among
the
various
things
i
forgot
to
pack
at
the
last
minute
my
diary
was
one
even
if
i
had
taken
it
i
probably
shouldn
t
have
found
time
to
record
all
we
did
then
as
i
was
with
mamma
and
papa
and
mildred
during
the
entire
vacation
there
was
no
necessity
for
writing
letters
i
did
n
t
go
to
washington
with
berri
for
two
reasons
the
family
naturally
wanted
me
to
spend
the
holidays
with
them
and
i
could
n
t
help
feeling
that
if
i
refused
berri
s
kind
invitation
he
would
be
much
more
likely
to
stay
part
of
the
time
at
least
in
cambridge
and
write
his
thesis
in
a
way
i
was
right
for
when
i
told
him
i
simply
could
n
t
go
with
him
he
said
sort
of
listlessly
well
then
i
suppose
i
ought
to
stay
here
and
finish
that
thing
oughtn
t
i
which
was
an
optimistic
way
of
letting
me
know
that
it
had
n
t
even
been
begun
i
did
n
t
know
what
to
answer
exactly
because
if
i
d
agreed
with
him
he
would
have
thought
me
unsympathetic
and
looked
hurt
and
if
i
had
advised
him
to
let
the
whole
matter
slide
and
forget
about
it
and
have
a
good
time
which
was
of
course
what
he
wanted
me
to
do
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
eventually
blame
me
for
giving
him
bad
advice
that
s
berri
all
over
so
i
merely
remarked
you
ll
have
to
be
the
judge
it
s
too
serious
a
matter
for
any
one
else
to
meddle
with
and
felt
like
a
nasty
little
prig
as
i
said
it
he
was
restless
and
gloomy
after
that
and
took
a
long
walk
all
alone
during
which
i
m
convinced
that
he
very
nearly
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
in
cambridge
and
slave
i
say
very
nearly
because
he
didn
t
bring
himself
quite
to
the
point
of
telling
anybody
about
it
but
the
next
afternoon
college
closed
with
the
last
lecture
of
that
day
when
i
turned
into
our
street
on
the
way
to
my
room
there
was
a
cab
with
a
steamer
trunk
on
it
standing
in
front
of
our
house
and
as
i
opened
the
front
door
berri
and
a
case
clattered
down
the
stairs
he
stopped
just
long
enough
to
shake
hands
and
exclaim
a
good
left
a
note
for
you
on
your
desk
the
train
goes
in
less
than
an
hour
then
he
rushed
out
of
the
gate
and
jumped
into
the
cab
slamming
the
door
after
him
with
that
sharp
thrilling
now
they
re
off
clack
that
cabs
and
cabs
only
possess
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
new
york
was
a
pleasing
delirium
of
theatres
and
operas
and
automobile
rides
up
and
down
fifth
avenue
with
just
enough
rows
between
mildred
and
me
and
papa
and
me
and
mildred
and
mamma
the
other
possible
combinations
never
scrap
to
make
us
realize
that
the
family
tie
was
the
same
dear
old
family
tie
and
had
n
t
been
in
any
way
severed
by
my
long
absence
it
took
us
three
days
to
persuade
mamma
to
ride
in
an
automobile
triumph
that
we
all
lived
bitterly
to
repent
for
she
ever
afterwards
refused
to
be
transported
from
place
to
place
by
any
other
means
was
not
only
inconvenient
but
ruinous
she
justified
her
extravagance
by
declaring
that
in
an
emergency
she
preferred
to
be
the
smasher
to
the
smashed
i
met
lots
of
fellows
i
knew
on
the
street
and
some
of
them
took
me
home
with
them
to
luncheon
or
to
that
curious
meal
they
call
tea
meeting
their
families
was
very
nice
and
i
felt
as
if
i
knew
the
fellows
ever
so
much
better
than
i
did
in
cambridge
one
incident
might
have
ended
in
a
tragedy
if
i
hadn
t
happened
to
preserve
a
certain
letter
of
mamma
s
never
write
anything
and
never
burn
t
it
talleyrand
who
tells
us
that
as
the
friend
of
berri
s
aunt
would
say
it
was
the
real
reason
of
our
spending
the
last
two
days
of
the
vacation
in
boston
and
came
about
in
the
following
way
one
day
at
luncheon
we
were
going
to
a
matinée
afterwards
i
glanced
at
my
watch
to
see
how
late
we
were
and
mamma
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
carrying
a
cheap
sort
of
an
affair
instead
of
the
heirloom
that
has
been
reposing
for
lo
these
many
weeks
in
hirsch
s
since
our
meeting
she
hadn
t
referred
to
this
painful
subject
and
as
i
had
become
used
to
the
dollar
watch
on
the
end
of
my
chain
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
say
anything
about
it
that
day
she
looked
at
the
watch
and
then
at
me
and
finally
she
murmured
why
tommy
with
the
expression
of
one
who
seems
to
see
the
foundations
of
truth
respectability
and
honor
crumbling
to
dust
and
she
finished
her
luncheon
in
silence
breathing
in
a
resigned
kind
of
way
and
studying
the
with
eyes
like
smitten
nots
on
the
way
upstairs
i
lagged
behind
and
mildred
said
to
me
mamma
has
on
her
look
what
on
earth
s
the
matter
now
but
i
was
unable
to
enlighten
her
mamma
had
known
from
the
first
that
the
watch
had
been
pawned
i
could
n
t
imagine
why
she
was
so
upset
all
was
explained
however
when
i
went
to
her
room
some
time
ago
she
had
sent
me
a
draft
for
thirty
dollars
it
came
in
a
cheerful
letter
no
letter
containing
a
draft
for
thirty
dollars
is
sad
about
nothing
in
particular
i
remembered
that
at
the
time
the
postscript
had
puzzled
me
for
it
said
of
course
i
have
told
your
father
nothing
about
this
and
there
was
no
clew
in
the
body
of
the
letter
to
what
this
referred
the
draft
wasn
t
mentioned
it
seems
that
mamma
was
under
the
impression
she
had
written
me
several
pages
on
the
evils
of
extravagance
the
horrors
of
debt
and
the
general
desirability
of
redeeming
one
s
watch
as
soon
as
possible
she
hadn
t
at
all
not
being
a
i
assumed
that
her
draft
was
a
spontaneous
outburst
of
maternal
esteem
had
it
cashed
with
a
loving
grateful
heart
and
spent
the
money
in
three
days
therefore
when
she
caught
sight
of
my
tin
timepiece
it
keeps
much
better
time
by
the
way
than
the
heirloom
ever
did
she
had
distressing
visions
of
me
indulging
in
a
perfect
carnival
of
embezzlement
and
finally
ending
up
with
shorn
locks
striped
clothes
and
a
chain
on
my
leg
i
never
realized
before
that
the
human
brain
is
perfectly
capable
under
certain
circumstances
of
harboring
two
distinct
beliefs
at
the
same
time
truth
of
either
one
of
which
necessarily
excludes
the
other
there
is
probably
a
more
technical
way
of
stating
this
but
i
haven
t
got
that
far
in
my
philosophy
course
as
yet
now
when
i
solemnly
declared
to
mamma
that
she
had
never
mentioned
her
check
in
connection
with
my
watch
or
anything
else
in
fact
i
am
sure
she
believed
me
she
said
she
believed
me
and
seemed
greatly
relieved
but
on
the
other
hand
although
she
knew
i
was
telling
the
truth
and
rejoiced
in
the
fact
i
am
certain
that
she
was
unable
at
the
same
time
to
abandon
her
equally
strong
conviction
that
she
had
written
and
sent
precisely
the
letter
she
had
intended
to
i
don
t
pretend
to
explain
this
mental
phenomenon
and
i
discreetly
refrained
from
discussing
it
with
mamma
for
in
the
midst
of
our
talk
i
began
to
have
a
dim
delicious
suspicion
that
her
letter
was
at
that
moment
reposing
in
my
inside
pocket
when
i
am
away
from
home
i
always
carry
several
plainly
addressed
letters
in
order
that
there
may
be
as
little
trouble
as
possible
in
case
anything
should
happen
to
me
i
remembered
having
put
the
letter
with
the
postscript
into
my
instead
of
my
desk
as
i
wished
to
refer
to
it
when
i
next
wrote
home
so
when
mamma
finally
said
well
i
believe
you
and
then
added
with
an
air
of
abstraction
but
i
wish
you
had
saved
that
letter
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
pocket
glanced
at
several
envelopes
and
exclaimed
dramatically
as
i
showed
her
one
of
them
madam
your
most
idle
whim
is
my
inexorable
law
then
we
all
went
to
the
matinée
but
that
wasn
t
the
end
of
the
watch
mamma
made
me
give
her
the
and
insisted
on
going
home
by
way
of
boston
for
the
purpose
of
redeeming
it
herself
the
reason
of
this
change
in
the
family
plans
was
not
explained
to
mildred
and
papa
but
they
were
docile
and
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
very
nice
to
see
my
rooms
before
leaving
for
home
there
was
no
opportunity
to
visit
hirsch
when
we
arrived
yesterday
as
we
spent
most
of
the
day
in
exploring
cambridge
but
this
morning
they
all
left
for
the
west
this
afternoon
while
mildred
was
packing
and
papa
had
gone
to
see
about
tickets
mamma
with
her
head
swathed
in
a
thick
black
veil
and
i
slipped
out
to
go
to
the
pawnbroker
s
i
have
an
idea
that
by
going
herself
instead
of
simply
sending
me
mamma
had
a
vague
but
noble
belief
that
she
was
rescuing
me
somehow
from
moral
shipwreck
and
then
no
doubt
the
mere
fact
of
one
s
venturing
out
incognito
as
it
were
to
wrest
ancestral
relics
from
usurious
fingers
is
not
without
a
certain
charm
well
of
course
we
met
papa
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
the
was
just
around
the
corner
and
he
had
engaged
berths
and
tickets
with
a
rapidity
that
was
as
unfortunate
as
it
was
incredible
for
he
greeted
us
with
starting
for
a
walk
i
m
just
in
time
and
proceeded
to
join
the
expedition
with
evident
pleasure
mamma
lingered
uneasily
on
the
sidewalk
a
moment
and
then
said
we
re
not
going
for
amusement
dear
we
re
going
to
shop
you
know
how
that
always
tires
you
but
papa
who
was
in
good
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
for
home
quite
unsuspiciously
ignored
the
suggestion
and
replied
cheerily
well
i
think
i
ll
go
along
i
might
want
to
buy
something
myself
i
exclaimed
how
jolly
in
a
sepulchral
tone
and
we
started
now
mamma
in
the
role
of
a
gay
deceiver
is
sublime
the
fact
that
she
is
trying
to
play
a
part
and
perhaps
setting
an
awful
example
makes
her
miserable
although
she
sometimes
succeeds
in
concealing
the
fact
until
afterwards
i
saw
that
we
were
in
for
a
delightful
morning
and
would
probably
end
by
missing
the
train
we
loitered
unscrupulously
in
front
of
shop
windows
apparently
entranced
by
everything
from
hardware
to
cigars
we
sauntered
in
and
out
of
countless
places
in
quest
of
ribbon
of
such
an
unusual
shade
that
boston
had
never
seen
its
like
we
paused
for
half
an
hour
now
and
then
to
inquire
the
price
of
diamond
tiaras
and
alabaster
clocks
set
with
rhinestones
we
bought
a
bouquet
of
roses
i
had
to
carry
it
from
a
man
and
tarried
to
hear
his
reminiscences
of
life
in
a
sawmill
we
went
to
pianola
recitals
phonograph
exhibits
and
assisted
at
an
auction
sale
of
furniture
and
papa
wearied
not
mamma
and
i
were
nearly
dead
but
he
not
only
wasn
t
bored
seemed
to
be
having
the
time
of
his
life
we
could
n
t
devise
anything
too
silly
and
futile
and
tiresome
for
him
to
enjoy
and
as
the
time
before
the
train
left
was
beginning
to
grow
ominously
short
mamma
at
last
resorted
to
heroic
measures
i
don
t
think
she
had
formed
any
definite
plan
when
she
abruptly
led
us
into
the
subway
but
our
going
there
was
probably
not
unconnected
in
her
imagination
with
the
boundless
opportunities
for
losing
oneself
in
the
sewers
of
paris
and
the
catacombs
of
rome
the
subway
may
or
may
not
resemble
these
historic
places
m
sure
i
don
t
know
at
any
rate
after
we
had
been
there
five
or
six
minutes
we
lost
papa
we
all
three
had
stood
aimlessly
watching
the
cars
whizz
up
to
the
platform
and
away
again
into
the
subterranean
dusk
until
papa
this
was
his
first
sign
of
impatience
mildly
remarked
i
think
dear
that
as
you
and
tommy
seem
to
be
rather
attached
to
this
place
i
ll
buy
a
newspaper
then
he
strolled
off
and
mamma
clutched
me
we
watched
him
approach
the
and
pick
up
a
magazine
his
back
was
partly
turned
it
s
our
only
chance
said
mamma
hoarsely
with
a
glance
towards
the
i
understood
and
seizing
her
hand
ran
with
her
to
the
nearest
car
an
instant
later
we
were
buzzing
through
the
bowels
of
the
earth
in
quite
the
opposite
direction
from
the
to
tell
the
truth
the
only
thing
i
knew
about
the
locality
of
hirsch
s
establishment
was
that
we
should
never
reach
it
unless
we
got
out
and
took
a
car
going
the
other
way
this
we
did
and
when
i
thought
we
had
gone
far
enough
on
the
return
trip
and
we
emerged
once
more
into
the
daylight
we
seemed
to
be
miles
from
the
only
which
i
could
have
found
my
way
so
we
jumped
into
a
cab
and
told
the
man
to
drive
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
that
place
i
had
to
describe
it
at
some
length
as
i
don
t
as
yet
know
the
names
of
many
streets
here
he
was
very
intelligent
however
and
it
was
n
t
his
fault
that
after
we
had
jolted
along
for
four
or
five
blocks
the
horse
fell
down
we
left
him
lifting
one
of
the
poor
thing
s
nervous
hind
legs
in
and
out
of
the
tangled
harness
he
looked
as
if
he
were
trying
to
solve
some
kind
of
a
gigantic
hopeless
puzzle
we
hurried
on
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
i
suddenly
discovered
that
we
had
been
in
the
right
street
all
the
time
it
was
one
of
those
queer
streets
that
never
look
familiar
when
you
re
going
the
other
way
i
confess
it
took
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
impart
this
discovery
to
mamma
but
she
appreciated
the
fact
that
we
had
very
little
time
to
lose
and
did
n
t
stop
to
point
out
to
me
that
if
i
ever
become
a
business
man
i
ll
be
a
failure
the
horse
was
on
his
feet
again
when
we
got
back
to
the
cab
so
we
jumped
in
once
more
and
after
an
interminable
drive
half
of
me
was
out
of
the
window
most
of
the
time
like
a
doll
directing
the
cabman
we
finally
drew
up
in
front
of
the
it
was
then
that
we
really
distinguished
ourselves
i
ve
come
for
my
watch
i
said
to
hirsch
he
gave
me
the
look
of
a
bird
of
prey
it
reminded
me
of
an
eagle
i
had
seen
once
eagle
that
had
been
stuffed
by
an
amateur
he
held
out
his
hand
and
spoke
a
solitary
fateful
word
mamma
s
the
excitement
of
the
moment
she
had
pushed
up
her
dim
with
horror
her
features
for
an
instant
were
positively
incoherent
the
ticket
she
whispered
gropingly
it
s
in
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
mildred
and
papa
and
a
group
of
porters
peering
up
and
down
the
street
like
a
concourse
of
sister
annes
were
on
the
curbstone
in
front
of
the
hotel
when
we
got
back
the
baggage
was
piled
on
a
wagon
papa
looked
haggard
and
years
older
than
when
i
had
last
seen
him
and
mildred
gave
us
a
haughty
stare
as
we
alighted
mamma
was
hustled
wildly
from
the
cab
to
the
carriage
and
i
had
time
merely
to
peck
hastily
at
their
tense
faces
and
gasp
as
the
carriage
swung
around
the
corner
mamma
appeared
for
a
moment
at
the
window
exclaiming
i
ll
send
it
to
you
in
my
first
letter
and
then
sank
from
view
this
afternoon
when
i
returned
to
my
peaceful
little
abode
in
cambridge
who
should
be
in
his
room
but
berri
he
was
at
his
desk
bending
earnestly
over
a
big
pad
of
thesis
paper
you
ve
finished
it
after
all
i
said
for
the
floor
near
his
chair
was
littered
with
neat
manuscript
yes
it
s
finished
beastly
pages
of
it
berri
answered
as
he
jumped
up
to
meet
me
i
wanted
to
ask
him
all
about
it
he
had
managed
to
do
it
during
the
gayeties
of
washington
and
if
it
had
taken
much
time
but
he
said
rather
wearily
oh
don
t
let
s
talk
about
it
i
m
so
sick
of
it
and
began
at
once
to
question
me
about
my
trip
to
new
york
we
chatted
for
about
half
an
hour
and
then
i
got
up
to
go
into
my
room
and
unpack
my
trunk
thesis
paper
is
n
t
like
the
ordinary
paper
on
which
themes
are
written
it
has
a
margin
on
all
four
sides
and
as
i
had
never
used
any
i
went
over
to
berri
s
desk
to
examine
a
sheet
of
his
why
you
ve
had
the
thing
i
exclaimed
for
there
was
a
pile
of
notes
in
front
of
the
thesis
paper
why
don
t
you
hand
it
in
that
way
instead
of
copying
it
again
your
hand
is
so
hard
to
read
berri
wrinkled
his
forehead
in
a
queer
annoyed
kind
of
way
then
he
looked
confused
and
blushed
a
little
and
finally
he
gave
an
uncomfortable
laugh
oh
granny
you
re
so
brutally
guileless
he
murmured
why
can
t
you
just
see
and
understand
things
it
sounds
so
much
worse
than
it
really
is
when
you
make
me
say
it
in
so
many
words
even
then
i
didn
t
altogether
grasp
the
situation
you
mean
that
somebody
helped
you
i
asked
that
did
n
t
seem
to
me
worth
making
such
a
fuss
about
somehow
well
that
s
a
very
refined
and
ladylike
way
of
putting
it
he
answered
i
got
a
man
in
the
law
school
to
write
it
for
me
and
paid
him
ten
dollars
for
his
trouble
i
had
never
thought
much
about
this
sort
of
thing
and
it
was
impossible
all
at
once
to
know
just
where
i
stood
in
the
matter
i
didn
t
know
what
to
say
and
i
think
i
blurted
out
oh
berri
i
m
so
sorry
well
i
m
sorry
you
know
about
it
berri
mused
drearily
no
i
m
not
either
he
added
quickly
after
a
moment
i
m
darned
glad
now
that
you
know
you
can
do
what
you
like
i
m
not
playing
the
hypocrite
anyhow
only
don
t
talk
to
me
about
it
i
ve
thought
the
whole
thing
over
from
every
point
of
view
it
s
the
only
thing
i
can
do
i
m
willing
to
run
the
risks
and
i
m
going
to
do
it
it
was
impossible
to
go
back
to
other
topics
after
that
so
i
went
into
my
room
and
unpacked
my
trunk
i
don
t
believe
i
ever
unpacked
so
carefully
and
put
everything
away
so
neatly
before
chester
came
in
and
complimented
me
as
i
was
finishing
it
must
have
been
because
i
was
thinking
with
all
my
thinking
however
i
can
t
say
that
i
ve
got
much
farther
than
i
was
when
berri
first
told
me
i
simply
know
that
he
oughtn
t
to
have
done
it
and
am
very
very
sorry
that
he
has
if
he
tried
to
defend
himself
in
any
way
i
could
have
it
out
with
him
but
he
does
n
t
when
he
finished
copying
the
thesis
he
came
into
my
room
and
said
i
m
going
over
to
drop
this
through
fleetwood
s
door
do
you
want
to
go
along
and
i
went
with
him
hoping
that
at
the
last
minute
he
might
in
his
unexpected
way
change
his
mind
on
the
way
over
he
did
burst
out
with
you
see
it
s
this
way
if
i
didn
t
know
fleetwood
so
well
i
should
n
t
do
it
i
shouldn
t
care
but
he
ll
think
if
i
fail
to
hand
in
the
written
work
that
i
m
presuming
on
the
fact
that
we
ve
breakfasted
together
at
the
holly
tree
and
gone
to
the
theatre
and
all
that
i
hate
that
kind
of
thing
i
tried
to
make
him
see
that
fleetwood
would
n
t
look
at
it
in
this
way
at
all
and
that
even
if
he
did
it
would
be
his
fault
not
berri
s
but
berri
answered
you
need
n
t
go
on
to
tell
me
how
dishonest
it
is
know
all
that
i
m
not
worse
than
lots
of
other
people
though
and
by
that
time
we
had
reached
fleetwood
s
door
i
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
as
he
was
about
to
drop
the
thesis
through
fleetwood
s
and
said
please
don
t
berri
wait
until
morning
anyhow
but
he
pushed
the
roll
through
the
door
and
as
it
fell
with
a
thud
inside
he
laughed
and
answered
too
late
now
i
m
going
to
forget
about
it
he
went
to
town
for
dinner
and
i
had
mine
about
an
hour
ago
at
brown
s
i
was
the
only
one
there
in
a
few
minutes
i
have
to
go
out
again
as
i
just
as
i
had
written
that
far
the
front
door
opened
and
slammed
and
the
tin
steps
clattered
as
they
only
do
when
duggie
is
coming
up
the
loneliness
of
the
house
and
the
feeling
that
college
opened
and
duggie
on
the
stairs
all
took
me
back
to
my
first
evening
in
cambridge
the
only
difference
was
that
instead
of
going
to
his
own
room
duggie
this
time
came
bursting
into
mine
i
came
to
say
he
exclaimed
and
when
i
got
over
my
astonishment
he
went
on
to
tell
me
that
he
had
decided
during
the
vacation
to
go
stay
until
class
day
he
had
never
told
me
before
that
he
had
taken
his
degree
in
three
years
and
that
it
would
n
t
have
been
necessary
for
him
to
come
back
this
year
at
all
if
he
had
n
t
wanted
to
he
has
been
entitled
to
his
degree
for
months
but
of
course
he
is
anxious
to
graduate
with
his
own
class
in
the
spring
he
has
n
t
talked
to
any
one
about
going
abroad
as
he
was
n
t
sure
of
it
until
a
few
days
ago
i
m
leaving
on
the
midnight
train
he
said
and
i
came
out
here
on
the
chance
of
your
having
got
back
my
family
are
all
in
the
country
i
left
them
this
afternoon
i
wanted
to
tell
him
how
sorry
i
was
that
he
was
leaving
us
and
how
glad
i
was
that
he
could
go
but
somehow
i
don
t
think
i
showed
what
i
really
felt
the
time
was
so
short
i
had
promised
duncan
duncan
to
help
him
with
some
advocate
editorials
at
half
past
eight
and
those
things
never
seem
to
sound
the
way
i
should
like
to
have
them
but
in
a
way
i
had
an
opportunity
to
let
him
know
how
i
felt
toward
him
for
while
we
were
sitting
there
he
laughed
and
said
as
you
won
t
stay
and
talk
to
me
i
think
you
might
at
least
do
the
next
best
thing
you
know
i
ve
always
wanted
to
read
this
and
now
that
i
m
going
away
you
ought
to
let
me
then
he
took
my
diary
from
the
mantelpiece
and
pretended
to
read
the
first
page
my
first
impulse
was
to
ask
him
not
to
if
he
had
been
going
to
stay
in
cambridge
i
should
n
t
have
let
him
of
course
but
as
he
was
leaving
in
a
few
hours
and
seemed
anxious
to
read
the
thing
and
as
it
really
did
n
t
make
any
difference
whether
he
did
or
not
i
finally
let
him
i
don
t
see
why
you
want
to
and
you
probably
won
t
get
beyond
the
first
few
pages
but
you
may
i
said
so
i
left
him
by
the
fire
with
the
diary
in
his
hand
i
thought
perhaps
i
should
find
a
note
about
it
when
i
got
back
this
evening
but
i
didn
t
poor
berri
i
felt
so
sorry
for
him
i
do
yet
in
fact
for
although
things
can
t
possibly
turn
out
in
the
way
he
thinks
they
may
i
can
t
tell
him
so
and
he
lives
in
a
state
of
perpetual
dread
but
it
won
t
last
long
now
duggie
s
steamer
must
have
almost
reached
southampton
by
this
time
and
it
won
t
take
more
than
a
week
or
eight
days
for
berri
to
hear
from
duggie
himself
i
came
very
near
giving
the
thing
away
at
one
time
it
s
hard
not
to
although
i
realize
that
duggie
was
wise
when
he
asked
me
to
let
matters
take
their
course
it
just
happened
that
the
next
day
after
berri
had
delivered
his
thesis
the
talk
at
luncheon
turned
on
cheating
at
exams
and
handing
in
written
work
that
is
n
t
your
own
the
sentiment
against
cheating
seemed
to
be
strong
partly
from
a
sense
of
honor
and
partly
from
a
sense
of
risk
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don
t
see
how
fellows
can
very
well
manage
to
cheat
an
examination
that
is
to
if
they
want
to
there
are
always
a
lot
of
proctors
prowling
up
and
down
the
room
ready
to
jump
on
anybody
who
has
bits
of
paper
on
his
desk
or
who
seems
to
be
unduly
interested
in
his
lap
or
the
condition
of
his
cuffs
and
then
besides
assuming
that
the
instructor
occasionally
gets
absorbed
in
a
newspaper
and
the
proctors
stroll
to
the
windows
to
watch
the
muckers
throwing
snowballs
in
the
yard
how
could
a
student
prepare
himself
for
this
rare
opportunity
it
may
be
different
in
courses
that
involve
the
exact
sciences
where
certain
definite
formulas
copied
on
a
small
bit
of
paper
might
be
of
use
but
in
the
sort
of
things
i
take
one
would
have
to
conceal
upon
oneself
the
encyclopædia
britannica
ploetz
s
epitome
of
history
geschmitzenmenger
s
ancient
art
or
the
dictionary
of
biography
in
order
to
accomplish
any
really
effective
deception
with
written
work
it
seems
to
be
easier
if
a
man
hands
in
a
theme
or
a
thesis
in
his
own
hand
the
instructors
are
more
or
less
forced
to
accept
it
as
original
unless
of
course
it
was
taken
outright
from
a
book
and
they
happen
to
be
familiar
with
the
book
from
what
the
fellows
at
the
table
said
there
must
be
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
done
than
i
had
imagined
although
since
berri
opened
my
eyes
i
could
believe
almost
anything
one
of
the
fellows
told
about
a
had
heard
of
who
succeeded
in
getting
himself
fired
two
or
three
years
ago
in
a
rather
complicated
way
he
was
engaged
and
his
sent
him
a
poem
in
one
of
her
letters
saying
that
she
had
written
it
for
him
the
letter
arrived
while
he
was
struggling
with
a
daily
theme
so
he
murmured
to
himself
tush
i
ll
copy
araminta
s
pretty
verses
and
send
them
in
as
my
own
as
they
have
just
gushed
from
her
surcharged
heart
into
her
letter
no
one
will
be
the
wiser
a
few
days
later
the
omnivorous
advocate
asked
permission
to
print
them
and
as
they
had
received
words
of
praise
from
the
instructor
and
as
the
fellow
by
that
time
had
no
doubt
begun
to
believe
he
had
written
them
himself
he
allowed
them
to
be
published
under
his
name
somebody
sent
a
copy
of
the
advocate
to
araminta
who
replied
with
an
indignant
letter
to
her
and
while
he
was
trying
to
think
up
an
explanation
of
the
matter
with
which
to
pacify
her
somebody
else
came
out
in
the
crimson
with
a
most
withering
communication
asking
how
the
advocate
dared
to
print
as
original
a
poem
that
had
been
written
by
his
grandfather
the
late
donovan
dennison
whose
complete
poetical
works
dan
cupid
and
other
idyls
could
be
found
in
the
college
library
at
any
time
whereupon
the
student
disgusted
at
his
s
dishonesty
in
palming
off
the
late
donovan
dennison
s
verses
as
original
broke
his
engagement
and
the
college
disgusted
with
the
student
for
precisely
the
same
reason
separated
him
to
use
the
suave
official
phrase
from
the
university
there
was
as
i
said
a
great
deal
of
talk
at
luncheon
that
day
about
cheating
some
of
the
men
seemed
to
think
the
presence
of
proctors
during
an
exam
was
insulting
but
as
bertie
stockbridge
remarked
this
struck
me
as
unanswerable
if
you
don
t
cheat
yourself
and
don
t
want
to
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
re
there
or
not
and
if
you
do
cheat
why
of
course
proctors
are
necessary
in
the
matter
of
dishonest
written
work
the
same
honorable
sentiments
were
expressed
everybody
was
sincere
but
i
could
n
t
help
realizing
a
little
that
they
could
not
have
had
very
much
temptation
as
yet
if
it
had
n
t
been
for
berri
i
probably
should
have
laid
down
the
law
as
loudly
as
the
rest
but
he
sat
there
eating
in
silence
irritated
and
oppressed
by
so
much
babbling
and
i
hated
to
hurt
him
by
adding
to
it
usually
he
is
one
of
the
last
to
leave
the
table
that
day
however
he
hurried
through
his
luncheon
and
slipped
away
alone
oh
dear
how
silly
those
two
words
look
written
down
and
yet
it
was
what
was
passing
through
my
mind
as
i
wrote
them
i
suppose
that
what
i
really
mean
is
how
tiresome
it
is
that
a
person
s
acts
don
t
begin
and
end
with
himself
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
any
limit
to
the
reach
of
their
influence
it
would
be
so
much
more
simple
and
easy
if
you
knew
just
where
the
consequences
of
a
mistake
or
an
indiscretion
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
began
and
ended
now
for
instance
take
berri
and
the
thesis
of
course
i
think
it
was
all
wrong
and
was
sorry
he
handed
it
in
but
i
wasn
t
going
to
let
it
make
any
difference
in
my
feelings
toward
berri
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
don
t
think
it
has
made
a
difference
yet
the
beastly
thing
cast
a
sort
of
gloom
over
the
house
for
berri
after
luncheon
that
day
rather
avoided
the
table
in
general
and
me
in
particular
what
his
object
was
in
doing
this
i
don
t
know
it
was
probably
just
a
feeling
on
his
part
but
it
made
me
feel
as
if
i
d
been
putting
myself
on
a
moral
pedestal
somehow
and
that
berri
saw
in
me
a
perpetual
accusation
our
relations
became
indescribably
changed
and
sort
of
formal
and
i
did
n
t
see
how
i
could
make
them
different
what
could
i
have
done
there
was
nothing
under
the
circumstances
for
me
to
say
he
stopped
in
my
room
that
night
to
warm
himself
for
a
minute
before
going
to
bed
but
i
don
t
think
he
said
anything
except
that
it
was
snowing
outside
the
next
day
we
had
the
blizzard
people
here
usually
assume
that
in
the
part
of
the
country
i
come
from
we
have
nine
months
of
winter
and
three
of
cold
weather
but
nevertheless
i
had
to
come
to
the
staid
and
temperate
east
to
see
the
kind
of
a
winter
storm
you
read
about
in
books
regular
old
wreck
of
the
hesperus
kind
in
which
the
crew
are
swept
like
icicles
from
the
deck
and
men
get
hopelessly
lost
and
are
frozen
to
death
in
their
own
front
yards
i
was
to
have
dined
in
town
that
night
with
hemington
who
had
tickets
for
a
paderewski
recital
but
he
did
n
t
turn
up
so
i
joined
some
fellows
who
found
me
in
the
restaurant
eating
alone
and
afterwards
went
to
the
theatre
with
them
it
was
snowing
when
we
left
the
restaurant
in
fact
great
wet
cottony
flakes
had
been
falling
at
intervals
all
day
it
reminded
me
of
those
marvellous
paper
weights
i
haven
t
seen
for
years
and
years
globes
filled
with
water
in
which
a
white
powdery
sediment
swirls
and
drifts
and
finally
settles
in
the
most
lifelike
way
on
a
beautiful
little
tin
landscape
what
s
become
of
them
all
i
wonder
but
there
was
no
wind
and
it
was
n
t
particularly
cold
so
i
don
t
think
that
anybody
suspected
what
was
going
to
happen
before
the
show
was
over
it
took
an
unusually
long
time
to
get
out
of
the
theatre
that
night
the
people
in
the
aisles
hardly
moved
at
all
but
after
we
had
forced
our
way
through
the
crowd
and
climbed
over
seats
and
finally
reached
the
narrow
corridor
leading
to
the
entrance
we
saw
why
it
was
the
ones
who
had
got
to
the
door
first
were
afraid
to
leave
within
an
hour
or
two
the
wind
had
risen
and
risen
until
it
screamed
through
the
streets
blasting
up
the
fallen
snow
in
wild
bewildering
spirals
and
then
fiercely
slapping
it
back
again
in
slants
of
hard
biting
cold
from
the
door
of
the
theatre
it
was
impossible
to
see
beyond
the
curbstone
except
when
the
lights
of
a
cab
lurched
by
over
the
drifts
the
rumor
went
through
the
crowd
that
the
wires
were
down
and
that
all
the
cars
had
stopped
no
one
seemed
to
know
quite
what
to
do
just
as
the
people
nearest
the
door
would
make
up
their
minds
to
start
bravely
out
a
thick
hurricane
would
strike
erratically
in
at
them
causing
the
ladies
to
shrink
back
with
little
exclamations
of
dismay
nobody
s
carriage
had
arrived
and
the
few
cabs
that
appeared
ploughed
laboriously
past
us
our
crowd
waited
a
few
moments
to
share
the
excitement
of
the
others
than
for
anything
else
then
we
turned
up
our
collars
and
plunged
out
standing
at
the
door
of
the
theatre
the
world
outside
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
in
a
sort
of
insane
uproar
but
as
soon
as
we
got
away
from
the
human
babble
and
i
lifted
my
head
and
opened
my
eyes
and
deliberately
relaxed
my
ears
so
to
speak
i
found
the
city
almost
solemnly
silent
every
now
and
then
when
we
came
to
a
cross
street
or
turned
a
corner
there
was
it
is
true
a
sudden
shriek
and
a
sort
of
rattle
of
fine
stinging
ice
particles
but
as
long
as
i
could
keep
myself
from
being
confused
inside
of
me
while
we
were
floundering
over
drifts
and
burrowing
with
our
heads
through
the
walls
of
wind
that
blocked
the
way
and
seemed
to
be
falling
on
us
i
could
n
t
help
noticing
the
terrible
muffledness
of
everything
it
was
as
if
the
place
were
being
swamped
blotted
out
suffocated
when
we
reached
the
hotel
where
we
had
dined
earlier
in
the
evening
the
other
fellows
went
in
to
have
something
to
eat
but
for
several
reasons
i
decided
not
to
in
the
first
place
i
promised
papa
that
i
would
try
to
economize
and
i
had
already
unexpectedly
squandered
two
dollars
on
a
theatre
ticket
owing
to
hemington
s
failure
to
appear
then
i
felt
that
if
i
did
n
t
make
a
dash
for
cambridge
right
away
i
should
n
t
get
there
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
never
did
reach
there
until
nine
the
next
morning
but
it
was
n
t
because
i
did
n
t
try
hard
enough
the
other
fellows
put
up
at
the
hotel
so
i
just
shouted
that
i
was
going
on
and
as
we
were
all
about
half
frozen
no
one
stopped
to
persuade
me
not
to
well
i
found
a
string
of
cars
about
a
mile
long
that
were
rapidly
turning
into
esquimau
huts
and
was
told
by
one
of
the
conductors
that
something
had
broken
down
ahead
and
that
as
the
could
n
t
get
by
they
probably
would
n
t
move
again
until
morning
he
thought
however
that
the
other
line
was
running
and
i
started
to
grope
my
way
to
bowdoin
square
i
would
n
t
go
through
that
experience
again
for
gold
and
precious
stones
and
i
can
t
imagine
now
why
i
did
it
in
the
first
place
except
that
i
had
acquired
by
that
time
a
kind
of
determination
to
reach
cambridge
and
did
n
t
know
what
i
was
in
for
it
was
n
t
so
bad
while
i
was
staggering
along
by
the
side
of
the
blocked
cars
they
were
lighted
and
i
knew
that
if
i
changed
my
mind
about
going
on
i
could
pop
into
one
of
them
and
be
safe
but
when
i
passed
the
last
one
and
found
myself
after
a
while
among
back
streets
choked
with
drifts
and
could
n
t
see
my
way
and
fell
down
twice
and
got
snow
up
my
sleeves
and
my
face
and
hands
and
feet
pained
so
with
cold
that
i
could
n
t
help
crying
actually
and
i
realized
at
last
that
i
did
n
t
in
the
least
know
where
i
was
i
began
to
be
i
m
not
the
huskiest
person
in
the
world
and
all
at
once
the
wind
blew
me
smash
against
an
iron
railing
and
almost
into
a
basement
of
some
kind
i
think
i
should
have
hunted
for
a
and
tried
to
get
into
a
house
if
i
hadn
t
a
moment
later
collided
with
a
policeman
fell
down
again
who
helped
me
up
and
led
me
to
a
sheltered
place
behind
a
wall
where
i
managed
to
collect
myself
and
tell
him
what
i
was
looking
for
he
too
was
on
his
way
to
bowdoin
square
so
after
that
i
just
hung
on
to
his
coat
most
of
the
time
and
tried
to
keep
my
legs
in
motion
without
really
knowing
much
where
he
was
leading
me
or
whether
we
were
making
any
progress
once
there
was
a
crash
over
our
heads
the
policeman
jumped
aside
and
then
stopped
to
exclaim
well
i
never
seen
the
likes
o
that
i
think
a
sign
had
blown
off
a
building
through
a
window
farther
on
a
dangling
wire
romped
in
the
wind
it
spat
dazzling
blue
and
purple
at
us
until
we
retreated
and
went
around
another
way
muttering
strange
hibernian
mutters
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
we
were
in
front
of
the
hotel
in
bowdoin
square
and
the
policeman
was
advising
me
through
his
frozen
mustache
not
to
go
to
cambridge
he
said
the
cars
had
stopped
long
ago
so
i
said
to
him
and
was
just
stumbling
into
the
café
when
who
should
come
out
but
berri
and
a
cabman
they
had
gone
in
to
get
warm
before
starting
across
the
bridge
i
m
not
sure
that
we
can
make
it
berri
said
but
the
man
says
he
s
willing
to
try
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
don
t
want
to
stay
at
the
hotel
when
we
get
inside
look
out
he
cried
to
me
as
i
opened
the
cab
door
and
was
about
to
jump
in
i
drew
back
expecting
at
least
to
be
decapitated
or
electrocuted
and
then
berri
explained
that
he
was
afraid
i
might
sit
on
the
pigeons
he
entered
the
cab
first
and
removed
some
indistinguishable
objects
from
the
back
seat
to
the
narrow
seat
that
lifts
up
in
front
that
s
why
i
can
t
very
well
stay
at
the
hotel
he
went
on
as
soon
as
these
poor
exhausted
little
darlings
begin
to
thaw
they
ll
fly
around
and
make
a
dreadful
fuss
i
d
rather
have
them
in
my
own
room
he
had
picked
up
four
half
frozen
pigeons
in
the
street
on
his
way
to
the
square
and
had
carried
in
his
pockets
and
two
in
the
bosom
of
his
he
came
across
the
cab
after
we
got
started
he
lighted
matches
every
now
and
then
to
see
how
they
were
getting
along
and
we
took
turns
at
blowing
on
their
pink
feet
all
shrivelled
with
cold
one
of
them
to
berri
s
grief
was
dead
but
by
the
time
the
cab
stopped
suddenly
and
for
the
last
time
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
it
had
been
going
slower
and
slower
and
tipping
more
perilously
over
mounds
of
snow
as
we
proceeded
the
other
three
looked
scared
and
intelligent
and
began
to
feel
warm
under
their
wings
the
driver
opened
the
door
and
said
he
could
n
t
go
on
as
a
fallen
wire
was
sagging
across
the
street
in
front
of
the
horse
s
nose
we
jumped
out
and
berri
was
just
about
to
seize
the
thing
and
try
to
lift
it
over
the
horse
s
head
when
i
remembered
the
murderous
ecstasy
of
the
other
one
and
jerked
him
back
ahead
of
us
there
was
a
drift
almost
as
high
as
the
cab
itself
and
the
man
said
that
even
without
the
wire
we
never
could
drive
over
or
through
it
so
after
a
short
consultation
he
decided
to
blanket
his
nag
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
in
the
cab
the
horse
was
dead
beat
he
said
and
he
very
much
doubted
if
it
could
pull
back
to
town
against
the
wind
even
after
turning
around
which
was
a
more
or
less
impossible
undertaking
in
itself
berri
and
i
packed
up
the
dead
one
included
as
berri
remembered
having
read
in
the
paper
that
morning
of
a
case
of
suspended
animation
somewhere
in
pushed
on
to
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
that
was
a
queer
night
i
was
simply
played
out
when
i
got
inside
the
and
i
had
n
t
been
there
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
i
discovered
that
my
ear
was
frozen
a
kind
officious
woman
all
but
broke
it
off
rubbing
snow
on
it
but
though
it
pained
excruciatingly
during
the
night
and
is
still
sensitive
and
has
a
tendency
to
stick
out
at
right
angles
from
my
head
i
think
it
will
recover
there
must
have
been
fifteen
or
twenty
people
cooped
up
in
the
and
the
with
hot
and
candy
facilities
next
door
some
of
them
were
cross
and
unhappy
and
some
of
them
were
facetious
one
of
them
had
a
small
dog
berri
s
pigeons
created
a
sensation
the
gave
us
a
box
to
put
them
under
and
berri
bought
them
popcorn
for
fear
they
might
be
hungry
during
the
night
the
warmth
of
the
room
revived
them
completely
all
but
the
dead
one
we
talked
for
a
while
but
as
berri
remembered
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
to
be
formal
and
impersonal
once
more
it
was
rather
dreary
we
could
have
slept
i
think
fact
we
were
asleep
when
one
of
the
facetious
refugees
woke
us
up
to
ask
if
we
did
n
t
want
to
join
him
and
some
other
gentlemen
in
a
game
of
euchre
disappointed
at
his
unsuccessful
efforts
to
interest
people
in
this
diversion
he
chased
the
little
dog
about
the
room
declaring
that
he
intended
to
tie
a
glass
of
chocolate
around
its
neck
and
send
it
out
in
the
storm
to
look
for
travellers
who
had
lost
their
way
it
was
impossible
after
that
to
get
to
sleep
again
we
had
been
sitting
with
our
heads
against
the
wall
for
almost
an
hour
waiting
for
daylight
when
berri
who
hadn
t
said
anything
for
ever
so
long
suddenly
came
out
with
oh
granny
i
m
so
sorry
i
did
it
i
knew
what
he
meant
at
once
although
the
thesis
had
n
t
been
in
my
mind
at
all
and
i
was
just
about
to
advise
him
to
have
a
talk
with
fleetwood
and
tell
him
everything
when
he
added
that
he
would
have
to
stand
by
himself
now
as
it
was
too
late
to
draw
back
the
worst
of
the
storm
was
over
the
cabman
had
come
in
to
get
warm
and
tell
us
that
his
horse
had
frozen
to
death
and
the
windows
of
the
had
begun
to
look
pale
instead
of
black
by
the
time
i
convinced
berri
that
it
wasn
t
too
late
and
that
as
soon
as
we
got
to
cambridge
he
ought
to
go
to
the
holly
tree
and
wait
until
fleetwood
came
in
for
his
breakfast
when
he
finally
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
i
never
saw
any
one
in
such
a
state
of
impatience
he
could
n
t
sit
still
and
kept
running
to
the
door
every
other
minute
to
see
if
the
was
coming
over
the
bridge
once
he
suggested
that
we
should
walk
but
although
the
morning
was
clear
and
beautiful
i
had
had
enough
of
struggling
through
mountains
of
snow
the
night
before
and
refused
the
plough
appeared
at
last
preceded
by
a
whirling
cloud
and
followed
by
a
car
we
set
the
pigeons
free
berri
told
them
all
to
return
with
olive
branches
as
quickly
as
possible
and
watched
them
fly
to
the
nearest
and
proceed
to
make
their
toilets
for
the
day
it
must
have
been
about
half
an
hour
after
i
parted
with
berri
he
went
on
to
the
holly
tree
and
i
came
to
my
room
that
he
bounded
up
the
stairs
pale
with
excitement
he
had
met
fleetwood
and
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
about
the
blizzard
the
whole
place
was
submerged
he
had
blurted
out
fleetwood
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
my
thesis
i
did
n
t
write
it
to
which
the
instructor
replied
almost
indifferently
yes
i
noticed
that
what
was
the
trouble
berri
just
looked
at
him
in
amazement
i
said
i
did
n
t
write
it
he
faltered
well
i
know
that
fleetwood
replied
a
trifle
sharply
he
was
inclined
to
be
peevish
berri
said
because
the
morning
papers
had
n
t
been
delivered
but
i
want
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
berri
added
the
situation
was
much
worse
berri
says
than
it
would
have
been
if
fleetwood
had
seemed
more
impressed
by
his
dishonesty
as
a
matter
of
fact
fleetwood
merely
smiled
oh
i
never
had
the
vaguest
idea
that
you
write
it
he
remarked
airily
but
if
you
don
t
care
i
don
t
it
s
much
easier
for
me
to
give
you
an
e
for
having
failed
to
hand
it
in
than
it
is
to
read
fifty
or
sixty
pages
of
your
impossible
writing
at
this
berri
said
he
almost
reeled
from
his
chair
did
n
t
i
hand
it
in
he
asked
while
his
heart
thumped
painfully
fleetwood
glanced
up
from
his
oatmeal
only
long
enough
to
say
i
wish
you
would
go
some
place
else
to
eat
you
bother
me
but
berri
insisted
dear
fleetwood
he
pleaded
eagerly
please
answer
me
just
that
one
thing
did
n
t
you
find
my
thesis
pushed
through
your
door
at
this
fleetwood
put
his
hands
to
his
head
as
he
always
does
when
he
s
pretending
that
we
re
trying
to
drive
him
mad
and
moaned
first
you
tell
me
you
have
n
t
written
your
thesis
and
then
you
ask
me
if
i
ve
picked
it
up
on
my
floor
oh
go
away
go
away
i
shall
never
be
able
to
finish
my
breakfast
and
get
back
through
all
that
ghastly
snow
to
my
clock
lecture
then
berri
dashed
out
forgetting
to
pay
for
his
breakfast
and
came
to
find
me
fleetwood
must
think
that
berri
isn
t
quite
right
for
he
followed
the
instructor
around
all
day
more
or
less
waiting
for
him
at
the
doors
of
lecture
halls
intercepting
him
in
front
of
the
colonial
club
at
running
after
him
in
the
square
and
calling
on
him
twice
at
his
room
to
ask
if
the
thesis
had
turned
up
yet
but
of
course
it
never
had
at
that
time
neither
of
us
could
account
for
its
disappearance
and
berri
can
t
yet
he
is
existing
in
a
state
of
nervous
dread
for
fear
it
may
have
fallen
behind
something
in
the
dark
vestibule
and
will
eventually
turn
up
well
it
will
turn
up
but
not
in
fleetwood
s
room
berri
spent
most
of
the
time
in
which
he
wasn
t
dogging
fleetwood
s
footsteps
discussing
the
thing
with
me
but
i
could
n
t
help
him
much
beyond
hoping
that
the
the
or
the
lost
will
in
dramas
at
the
bowdoin
square
t
be
found
until
the
fifth
act
after
an
elapse
of
twenty
years
i
had
to
leave
him
alone
part
of
the
afternoon
duncan
duncan
sent
me
word
that
he
was
sick
and
that
the
advocate
was
in
dire
need
so
i
floundered
through
the
alley
to
the
and
learned
from
the
that
they
had
to
have
six
inches
of
poetry
immediately
or
the
paper
would
be
very
much
delayed
i
did
n
t
know
what
to
do
as
we
had
n
t
any
poems
of
that
length
in
stock
so
to
speak
while
i
was
sitting
there
in
despair
one
of
the
printers
gave
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
said
here
hurry
up
and
write
a
couple
of
sticks
of
po
try
i
want
to
go
home
he
was
quite
serious
so
i
got
to
work
and
in
about
fifteen
minutes
had
written
twenty
lines
about
the
pigeons
in
the
blizzard
only
i
referred
to
them
for
various
technical
reasons
as
doves
there
was
a
heavenly
smell
of
printer
s
ink
in
the
place
which
made
it
easier
to
write
somehow
no
letters
came
that
day
from
any
direction
on
account
of
the
storm
the
next
afternoon
i
met
the
postman
on
the
steps
he
stopped
to
chat
and
i
thought
i
should
grab
the
letters
from
his
hand
before
he
finished
as
i
caught
sight
of
one
in
duggie
s
handwriting
addressed
to
me
i
thought
of
course
that
he
had
postponed
his
trip
and
had
written
to
tell
me
why
the
postman
talked
on
and
on
but
he
told
me
one
tale
that
interested
me
in
spite
of
myself
one
sunday
morning
old
professor
pallas
my
ally
in
the
hieroglyphics
course
went
over
to
the
for
his
letters
he
must
have
been
thinking
very
deeply
about
recent
discoveries
or
cuneiform
inscriptions
or
some
such
thing
because
when
he
went
up
to
the
window
he
could
n
t
remember
whose
letters
he
had
come
for
so
he
said
to
the
clerk
young
man
do
you
know
who
i
am
the
clerk
unfortunately
was
a
new
one
and
had
to
confess
with
regret
that
he
did
n
t
so
professor
pallas
after
a
moment
or
two
of
reflection
looked
up
and
murmured
through
the
window
i
ask
you
this
because
i
am
equally
at
a
loss
myself
but
perhaps
if
i
take
a
little
walk
it
may
come
to
me
then
he
strolled
away
and
in
about
ten
minutes
returned
very
much
pleased
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
remembered
it
all
by
myself
he
exclaimed
and
wrote
it
down
i
got
duggie
s
letter
at
last
and
ran
upstairs
to
read
it
this
is
what
it
said
dear
granny
are
steaming
slowly
out
of
the
harbor
and
i
am
sitting
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
deck
writing
you
this
note
for
the
pilot
to
take
back
with
him
my
fingers
are
stiff
with
cold
but
as
the
air
down
below
is
thick
with
what
chester
calls
floral
tributes
i
d
rather
stay
here
and
say
to
you
and
the
goddess
of
liberty
at
the
same
time
what
i
wish
particularly
to
do
however
is
to
thank
you
for
letting
me
read
your
diary
last
night
i
have
some
things
to
say
about
parts
where
i
come
in
i
that
can
wait
and
to
make
a
confession
when
i
got
to
the
last
page
where
the
ink
was
scarcely
dry
i
dashed
over
to
fleetwood
s
room
although
i
had
lingered
so
long
in
your
room
i
did
n
t
have
any
too
much
time
in
which
to
catch
my
train
fortunately
there
was
a
light
in
fleetwood
s
window
while
i
was
talking
to
him
i
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
the
great
pile
the
plural
theses
or
thesises
his
desk
and
when
he
went
into
his
bedroom
for
a
minute
to
get
a
book
for
me
to
read
going
over
i
sniped
berri
s
performance
from
the
top
of
the
pile
and
stuck
it
in
my
pocket
i
did
it
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
and
i
may
have
been
all
don
t
know
the
whole
thing
worries
me
but
don
t
say
anything
to
berri
about
it
i
should
n
t
care
to
get
you
and
the
diary
into
trouble
when
i
reach
southampton
i
ll
send
the
thing
back
to
him
with
a
letter
granny
take
care
of
yourself
and
write
often
duggie
some
day
i
m
going
to
write
a
book
about
boston
because
it
s
the
most
wonderful
place
in
the
world
i
suppose
i
really
mean
by
this
that
it
is
so
different
from
perugia
berri
of
course
would
have
to
help
me
is
he
would
unless
i
lived
here
fifty
or
sixty
years
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
notes
it
would
take
about
that
long
to
understand
everything
and
be
able
to
write
intelligently
and
sympathetically
anybody
of
course
may
sojourn
for
a
time
among
the
as
he
may
among
the
chinese
or
the
strange
races
of
the
pacific
record
his
impressions
of
them
but
i
don
t
think
his
remarks
would
be
more
valuable
than
the
ordinary
travel
book
that
tells
you
merely
the
things
you
could
tell
yourself
if
you
were
on
the
spot
with
a
pencil
and
a
strong
right
arm
really
to
know
the
place
you
have
to
be
born
and
brought
up
here
which
in
itself
amounts
to
saying
that
boston
will
never
never
be
understood
for
the
people
who
were
born
and
brought
up
here
know
and
won
t
tell
know
and
can
t
tell
berri
declares
it
would
take
a
genius
to
do
the
thing
properly
he
says
and
boston
went
out
of
the
genius
business
some
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
now
berri
was
born
in
paris
kentucky
as
a
southern
girl
once
asked
him
and
i
don
t
suppose
he
s
a
genius
actually
but
as
he
has
on
his
mother
s
side
more
cousins
and
aunts
and
things
in
boston
than
anybody
i
m
ever
likely
to
know
so
very
intimately
and
as
he
seems
more
like
a
genius
than
anybody
i
ve
ever
seen
before
what
he
tells
me
always
sounds
somehow
as
if
it
were
the
real
thing
he
laughed
though
the
other
were
taking
a
long
i
said
this
to
him
and
answered
that
it
was
very
evident
i
did
n
t
know
what
the
real
thing
was
not
he
added
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
am
able
quite
seriously
at
times
to
consider
going
some
place
else
to
live
after
i
finish
with
all
this
and
he
fluttered
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
cambridge
does
n
t
anybody
else
i
asked
mercy
you
talk
he
exclaimed
why
should
they
i
suppose
i
was
thinking
of
papa
i
replied
meekly
he
believes
it
s
better
for
most
young
men
to
get
away
from
home
and
start
life
for
themselves
as
soon
as
they
grow
up
they
re
always
boys
to
somebody
unless
they
do
he
says
then
besides
he
has
great
faith
in
perfectly
new
places
he
s
often
told
me
that
even
perugia
was
too
old
and
crowded
for
a
young
man
perugia
was
years
old
last
spring
berri
laughed
that
s
important
if
true
he
answered
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
boston
why
i
merely
imagined
that
some
one
in
this
part
of
the
world
might
have
the
same
idea
i
suggested
now
take
duggie
for
instance
don
t
you
think
that
duggie
wants
to
get
out
and
try
to
do
something
oh
duggie
said
berri
with
a
shrug
he
thinks
he
does
now
but
he
really
doesn
t
of
course
duggie
is
simply
slopping
over
with
strenuousness
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
he
gets
most
of
it
out
of
books
s
books
at
that
and
after
all
as
i
say
he
slops
over
it
ll
just
run
into
the
sand
without
making
even
a
silly
little
hole
after
a
while
when
he
gets
tired
of
reading
and
thinking
how
unworthy
everybody
else
is
it
won
t
do
even
that
duggie
in
college
is
stunning
and
a
leader
of
men
but
duggie
at
forty
will
be
leading
nothing
but
a
beautiful
purple
life
down
there
at
his
of
course
he
gets
fat
if
he
gets
fat
he
ll
be
a
stockbroker
say
berri
how
old
are
you
anyhow
i
asked
i
know
he
is
older
than
i
am
but
he
never
will
tell
me
how
much
didn
t
this
time
just
laughs
and
says
his
early
education
was
grossly
neglected
over
there
in
europe
or
he
would
have
been
classes
and
classes
ahead
of
me
i
did
n
t
like
what
he
said
about
duggie
and
told
him
so
he
answered
that
i
d
brought
it
on
myself
and
i
suppose
i
had
maybe
we
d
better
talk
about
bertie
stockbridge
he
added
he
s
my
third
cousin
you
dear
me
if
people
begin
to
be
loyal
to
third
cousins
boston
would
turn
into
a
sort
of
gigantic
asylum
for
deaf
mutes
i
don
t
mind
you
say
about
bertie
besides
he
s
a
more
perfect
specimen
than
duggie
because
duggie
is
passing
through
a
phase
even
bostonians
sometimes
pass
through
phases
when
they
re
very
young
it
doesn
t
happen
often
though
the
truth
is
duggie
can
t
decide
whether
to
be
a
greek
god
or
a
college
settlement
he
d
really
rather
be
a
greek
god
only
it
s
so
immoral
he
ll
probably
end
you
know
by
coming
out
of
his
trance
some
june
morning
and
finding
himself
married
then
it
will
be
too
late
to
be
either
one
or
the
other
but
what
was
it
we
were
talking
about
oh
now
bertie
isn
t
passing
through
a
phase
not
on
your
life
bertie
just
rose
in
a
state
of
hopeless
completion
from
the
crystal
waters
of
the
back
bay
he
never
disappoints
but
i
like
bertie
i
protested
not
as
much
as
i
do
duggie
of
course
but
i
do
like
him
he
s
sensible
berri
screamed
why
child
the
stockbridge
family
is
sense
with
trousers
bagging
at
the
knee
and
adam
s
apples
rising
and
falling
above
their
abashed
collars
bertie
s
ancestors
came
into
a
lovely
foolish
world
and
sense
that
s
all
they
ever
do
now
create
one
another
and
sense
so
the
next
time
you
hear
some
old
thing
groaning
about
the
scarcity
of
you
ll
know
that
it
s
because
the
stockbridges
have
it
all
and
a
few
friends
who
live
in
the
same
street
during
the
winter
and
share
several
thousand
front
feet
of
the
atlantic
ocean
from
may
to
november
but
you
mustn
t
think
i
don
t
like
bertie
and
his
family
i
should
simply
say
bertie
for
bertie
is
his
family
i
do
you
know
i
admire
him
very
much
berri
added
after
a
moment
he
radiates
a
sort
of
atmosphere
of
modest
infallibility
that
makes
me
feel
exactly
as
i
should
feel
if
i
suddenly
went
into
appleton
chapel
and
found
the
pope
there
reading
the
boston
transcript
calmly
and
without
the
slightest
tinge
of
bitterness
i
admit
that
bertie
is
always
right
you
heard
what
he
said
to
bobbie
colburn
didn
t
you
it
was
after
the
hour
exam
in
english
and
we
were
all
in
bobbie
s
room
comparing
notes
now
bertie
had
passed
of
course
because
he
ll
always
pass
in
everything
whether
he
has
any
talent
for
it
or
not
but
he
had
n
t
passed
particularly
well
it
takes
a
person
of
some
imagination
to
get
a
good
mark
in
that
course
bobbie
colburn
on
the
other
hand
who
apparently
hadn
t
studied
at
all
and
who
d
been
having
a
fierce
time
the
night
before
the
exam
just
sailed
into
the
with
a
on
under
his
overcoat
and
got
through
brilliantly
which
worried
bertie
to
death
we
d
all
made
some
comment
on
the
matter
and
finally
colburn
as
if
to
end
it
said
in
his
breezy
way
well
you
know
the
old
proverb
laughs
best
who
drinks
most
whereupon
bertie
fixed
him
with
his
fine
gray
eyes
and
remarked
that
is
n
t
the
way
it
goes
colburn
you
ve
got
it
then
he
repeated
the
words
correctly
with
triumph
exactly
but
with
the
cold
joy
of
one
whose
life
is
spent
in
righting
unimportant
wrongs
and
yet
i
can
t
help
confessing
berri
mused
that
i
m
exceedingly
glad
to
acknowledge
my
relationship
to
bertie
and
his
tribe
they
madden
me
at
times
they
have
such
clear
narrow
unelastic
admirable
intellects
their
attitude
toward
all
questions
public
or
private
is
so
definite
and
uncompromising
they
re
so
why
american
history
is
just
one
glad
sweet
testimonial
to
the
fact
that
they
re
never
wrong
they
re
not
always
on
the
popular
side
or
the
successful
they
re
merely
right
any
other
human
beings
would
keep
on
trying
to
make
use
of
such
a
splendid
faculty
years
and
years
ago
they
did
make
use
of
it
but
nowadays
it
s
enough
just
to
know
that
they
have
it
and
pretty
much
all
to
themselves
but
as
i
was
saying
i
m
secretly
darned
glad
that
bertie
and
i
belong
to
each
other
so
to
speak
is
n
t
it
m
not
a
bit
loyal
to
bertie
but
he
s
perfectly
loyal
to
me
he
does
n
t
in
the
least
understand
me
i
don
t
think
he
even
likes
me
although
that
disturbing
thought
probably
has
n
t
occurred
to
him
yet
but
there
s
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
i
m
one
of
his
relatives
and
he
accepts
me
me
in
a
way
he
never
will
accept
no
matter
how
well
he
gets
to
know
you
and
like
you
there
s
something
rather
fine
in
that
don
t
you
think
of
course
it
might
be
a
good
deal
of
a
bore
if
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
but
as
he
won
t
it
s
really
a
great
comfort
the
fact
that
that
plain
but
silent
person
in
the
very
badly
made
dark
gray
suit
accepts
me
and
will
always
accept
me
is
equivalent
to
an
illuminated
address
of
welcome
and
the
freedom
of
the
city
you
really
can
t
imagine
how
it
simplifies
things
berri
continued
it
s
such
a
relief
such
an
absolution
it
leaves
me
as
some
one
says
with
nothing
on
my
mind
but
my
hair
and
my
hat
and
even
they
don
t
have
to
be
brushed
as
long
as
people
consider
me
a
stockbridge
at
heart
why
if
i
didn
t
feel
like
it
i
shouldn
t
have
to
be
even
polite
of
course
i
am
polite
but
it
s
a
mere
habit
with
me
i
dare
say
i
ll
get
out
of
it
you
ve
noticed
haven
t
you
how
brusque
and
sort
of
primitive
bertie
s
manner
is
as
a
rule
well
they
re
all
more
or
less
like
that
people
who
like
them
say
it
arises
from
shyness
and
simplicity
and
people
who
don
t
like
them
declare
that
it
s
just
common
or
domestic
rudeness
but
it
really
is
n
t
one
or
the
other
and
i
think
i
ought
to
know
the
family
manner
comes
from
a
curious
conviction
that
politeness
grace
practice
of
making
oneself
agreeable
free
of
charge
so
to
to
do
with
the
emotions
which
is
perfectly
absurd
the
habit
of
politeness
is
about
as
emotional
as
the
habit
of
brushing
one
s
teeth
but
bertie
s
tribe
does
n
t
think
so
and
emotion
with
them
is
simply
another
word
for
effeminacy
you
see
they
re
so
sure
of
coming
up
to
the
scratch
in
the
big
things
that
they
let
the
little
ones
slide
i
think
they
always
vaguely
associate
politeness
with
french
waiters
and
neapolitan
cripples
so
in
a
way
they
ll
rather
expect
it
of
you
they
like
all
foreigners
to
seem
foreign
bertie
gabbled
about
no
end
of
things
that
afternoon
he
had
what
he
calls
a
dry
jag
and
hardly
ever
stopped
talking
from
the
time
we
left
our
house
just
after
luncheon
until
we
came
down
brattle
street
on
the
way
back
and
went
into
brown
s
for
dinner
once
he
and
a
lot
of
kids
coming
out
of
a
schoolhouse
away
across
the
river
somewhere
pasted
one
another
with
snowballs
i
joined
them
until
a
policeman
made
us
stop
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
torrent
of
talk
was
interrupted
but
he
made
up
for
it
by
yelling
every
time
he
hit
any
one
or
got
hit
himself
he
told
me
all
sorts
of
tales
and
i
could
n
t
help
thinking
how
different
everything
was
from
perugia
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
before
that
perugia
was
so
and
uncivilized
why
out
there
we
just
seem
to
grow
up
like
those
great
round
weeds
on
the
prairie
that
suddenly
let
go
for
no
particular
reason
and
then
bound
along
in
the
breeze
through
the
wide
flat
streets
until
they
run
against
a
fence
or
a
house
and
for
a
while
stick
there
it
does
n
t
seem
to
me
that
anything
much
is
decided
for
us
in
advance
i
did
n
t
know
even
that
i
was
coming
to
college
until
about
a
year
and
a
half
beforehand
made
it
simply
awful
as
i
had
to
study
everything
at
once
and
did
n
t
learn
much
of
anything
now
berri
says
that
with
the
exception
of
himself
who
was
grossly
neglected
and
never
studied
anything
but
french
and
german
his
entire
family
for
generations
has
lived
by
a
sort
of
educational
and
social
calendar
from
which
they
never
deviate
except
in
the
event
of
a
civil
war
he
says
he
should
n
t
be
a
bit
surprised
to
learn
that
there
were
certain
definite
unalterable
dates
at
which
the
little
boys
began
and
left
off
tin
soldiers
and
the
breeding
of
and
the
little
girls
began
and
left
off
and
dressing
up
he
declares
that
providing
the
laws
of
nature
are
reasonably
consistent
they
all
know
exactly
what
they
ll
be
doing
at
any
period
of
their
lives
that
even
matrimony
has
ceased
to
be
a
lottery
with
them
as
they
go
in
for
marrying
not
individuals
but
types
isn
t
it
perfectly
wonderful
now
take
bertie
he
said
bertie
knew
who
his
classmates
in
college
were
going
to
be
at
the
age
of
five
they
re
the
same
chaps
he
s
been
going
to
school
with
and
to
the
kid
you
know
the
saturday
mornings
and
thursday
afternoons
or
whatever
they
are
all
these
years
they
go
to
the
friday
evenings
this
year
and
next
year
they
ll
go
to
the
saturday
evenings
and
at
all
these
morns
and
noons
and
dewy
eves
they
dance
with
the
same
girls
that
two
years
from
now
they
ll
meet
in
society
and
subsequently
marry
just
because
it
s
part
of
the
routine
after
they
get
out
of
college
they
ll
all
go
abroad
for
a
few
months
in
groups
of
three
and
four
and
when
they
get
back
they
ll
be
taken
into
the
same
club
their
names
will
have
been
on
the
waiting
list
some
years
and
they
ll
join
a
lunch
club
down
town
in
order
not
to
miss
seeing
one
another
every
day
at
noon
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
then
berri
told
me
about
the
girls
really
my
heart
bleeds
for
the
girls
because
apparently
unless
they
are
terribly
pretty
or
terribly
clever
or
terribly
rich
they
must
have
a
devil
of
a
time
berri
says
that
although
they
all
come
out
they
don
t
all
stay
out
that
after
about
a
year
or
so
a
good
many
of
them
sort
of
slink
in
again
by
unanimous
consent
imagine
such
a
thing
in
perugia
why
every
girl
has
a
good
time
there
for
just
as
long
as
she
wants
to
the
pretty
ones
however
never
go
in
again
because
if
you
once
get
a
reputation
for
beauty
here
berri
says
it
never
leaves
you
the
reputation
i
mean
and
that
s
why
an
evening
party
in
boston
often
strikes
a
stranger
as
being
so
largely
a
matter
of
physical
traditions
at
a
dance
the
rich
plain
girls
he
says
have
a
good
time
too
but
only
for
the
first
part
of
the
evening
the
men
speak
of
them
as
pills
a
quaint
chivalrous
custom
is
it
not
and
try
to
dance
with
them
as
early
in
the
evening
as
possible
because
everybody
else
is
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
and
there
isn
t
so
great
a
chance
of
getting
stuck
for
an
hour
or
so
but
later
on
they
ask
only
the
ones
they
really
want
to
dance
with
and
the
plain
rich
girl
finds
herself
spending
a
cozy
eternity
with
some
one
who
is
inwardly
moaning
because
he
delayed
until
the
rush
was
over
the
girls
too
are
born
into
a
sort
of
rut
berri
says
it
takes
the
form
of
berri
can
discourse
for
hours
at
a
time
on
these
institutions
his
aunt
josephine
has
been
going
to
the
same
one
every
week
for
fifty
years
he
said
that
once
when
he
was
a
little
child
he
heard
an
englishman
who
had
lived
in
india
telling
about
the
mysterious
rapidity
with
which
a
piece
of
news
spread
among
the
natives
of
that
country
within
half
a
day
this
man
declared
a
rumor
would
sort
of
leap
through
the
air
from
calcutta
to
the
most
obscure
villages
on
the
afghan
frontier
and
no
one
could
explain
how
it
was
done
berri
used
to
fall
asleep
at
night
worrying
over
it
but
now
even
in
india
romance
is
dead
berri
says
he
s
convinced
that
the
whole
thing
was
nothing
but
just
why
granny
if
i
were
to
lock
myself
up
in
my
room
in
cambridge
and
draw
the
curtains
and
stuff
the
keyhole
and
then
murmur
in
a
low
voice
for
instance
that
you
and
sarah
bernhardt
had
been
quietly
married
at
the
first
baptist
church
in
somerville
that
afternoon
and
then
dash
in
to
my
aunt
josephine
s
as
fast
as
a
car
could
take
me
she
would
greet
me
in
the
library
with
my
dear
you
heard
i
ve
just
come
from
the
and
they
course
i
don
t
believe
it
so
on
and
this
is
n
t
any
idle
jest
either
it
s
a
fact
he
was
just
beginning
to
tell
me
something
else
about
forget
we
both
realized
that
it
was
rather
late
and
that
if
we
expected
to
get
back
in
time
for
dinner
we
should
have
to
find
a
shorter
way
or
take
the
car
we
neither
of
us
knew
where
we
were
although
berri
said
the
place
looked
as
if
it
might
be
called
corners
so
we
stopped
a
little
girl
who
was
trudging
along
with
a
pitcher
of
milk
in
her
hand
little
girl
can
you
tell
me
where
we
are
berri
asked
her
solemnly
she
stared
at
us
for
a
moment
with
great
round
eyes
berri
admitted
afterwards
that
the
question
was
a
stupid
one
and
finally
answered
in
a
high
scornful
little
voice
main
street
berri
refused
to
ask
again
after
that
and
we
strolled
about
for
a
time
until
we
caught
sight
of
the
tower
of
memorial
suddenly
appeared
against
the
sky
in
quite
the
wrong
direction
then
of
course
getting
home
was
easy
enough
we
were
rather
confidential
on
the
way
back
and
talked
about
the
dickey
which
we
had
never
discussed
before
the
dickey
is
the
great
sophomore
secret
society
i
don
t
remember
just
how
the
subject
came
up
but
something
reminded
berri
of
one
night
earlier
in
the
year
of
the
nights
on
which
the
society
takes
on
ten
new
members
they
choose
them
from
the
sophomore
class
always
except
late
in
the
spring
just
before
college
closes
when
first
ten
elected
from
among
the
freshmen
however
by
that
time
the
freshmen
are
almost
sophomores
so
it
amounts
to
about
the
same
thing
when
a
ten
is
taken
on
the
whole
club
marches
through
the
streets
at
about
eleven
o
clock
at
night
singing
a
song
that
has
no
words
but
tra
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
it
s
a
wonderful
little
tune
it
s
very
short
and
simple
and
after
you
ve
heard
it
once
it
sticks
in
your
head
you
can
t
forget
it
unlike
other
catchy
airs
though
you
somehow
don
t
get
tired
of
it
i
ve
heard
it
over
and
over
again
since
i
ve
been
here
pianos
as
i
passed
under
the
windows
of
upper
classmen
whistled
by
muckers
in
the
yard
and
sung
by
the
club
at
night
it
always
gives
me
a
thrill
i
suppose
it
s
because
it
means
such
a
lot
and
because
you
realize
that
no
one
except
the
muckers
would
play
it
or
sing
it
or
whistle
it
who
was
n
t
entitled
to
on
the
night
that
berri
referred
to
the
club
must
have
been
half
a
mile
away
when
we
first
heard
it
berri
was
in
my
room
reading
and
i
was
writing
a
letter
my
back
was
toward
him
and
we
neither
of
us
said
anything
when
the
vague
musical
tra
la
la
las
floated
up
from
away
down
by
the
river
somewhere
they
were
very
faint
and
after
a
minute
or
two
stopped
entirely
then
just
as
i
had
forgotten
about
it
the
song
began
again
little
louder
and
more
distinct
this
time
and
getting
louder
every
second
then
it
suddenly
broke
off
once
more
but
i
didn
t
forget
it
for
i
knew
that
the
club
had
stopped
to
take
some
one
out
of
his
one
who
had
just
been
march
him
along
with
the
others
and
i
waited
kind
of
nervously
for
the
refrain
to
begin
again
it
never
gets
started
quite
evenly
a
few
voices
at
first
the
rest
joining
in
as
the
crowd
turns
away
from
the
door
of
the
neophyte
s
house
and
starts
along
the
street
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
song
grew
louder
and
louder
some
of
the
fellows
were
singing
a
clear
tenor
that
made
the
last
few
notes
of
every
verse
die
away
in
a
kind
of
high
sad
wail
it
seemed
ridiculous
for
me
to
be
sitting
there
pretending
to
write
a
letter
with
berri
reading
in
such
elaborate
unconsciousness
by
the
fire
when
the
ears
of
both
of
us
were
strained
to
catch
every
note
and
the
hoarse
fierce
shouts
that
suddenly
broke
through
the
song
as
the
dickey
turned
into
our
street
but
neither
of
us
knew
what
to
say
exactly
at
last
however
i
could
n
t
stand
it
any
longer
and
jumped
up
and
blew
out
both
the
lamps
with
the
room
dark
we
could
stand
at
the
window
and
not
be
seen
freshmen
are
n
t
expected
to
show
any
particular
interest
in
the
proceedings
of
the
dickey
it
s
considered
fresh
they
were
just
tramping
past
our
house
when
we
leaned
out
singing
shouting
irresistible
mob
berri
and
i
looked
down
at
them
in
silence
we
were
both
excited
and
i
felt
chilly
all
that
may
have
been
on
account
of
the
open
window
the
crowd
did
not
pass
on
as
we
thought
it
would
but
stopped
at
a
house
across
the
street
a
few
doors
down
once
more
the
song
ceased
men
formed
in
a
double
line
that
reached
from
the
piazza
to
the
street
and
there
were
hoarse
cries
of
pull
him
him
out
then
the
front
door
burst
open
and
a
seemed
to
be
half
hurtling
through
the
air
between
the
double
row
waiting
for
him
there
was
a
moment
of
confusion
and
savage
yells
during
which
it
looked
as
if
the
whole
crowd
was
trying
to
get
its
hands
on
him
we
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
shuffle
and
in
another
instant
the
song
began
louder
than
before
and
the
dickey
swayed
away
into
the
darkness
we
stood
at
the
window
until
the
clearness
and
energy
of
the
tra
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
faded
to
a
thin
dim
uncertain
rhythm
suggestion
of
tenor
that
all
but
lost
itself
in
the
pearly
fog
rolling
up
from
the
marshes
i
fumbled
for
a
match
when
we
turned
at
last
to
the
room
but
before
i
found
one
berri
said
i
think
i
ll
go
to
bed
granny
and
by
the
time
i
got
the
lamp
lighted
he
had
slipped
away
i
don
t
know
why
exactly
but
i
was
rather
glad
he
hadn
t
waited
after
that
i
tried
to
finish
my
letter
but
i
could
n
t
make
myself
end
the
sentence
i
had
been
writing
the
way
i
had
meant
to
end
it
in
the
first
place
so
i
put
the
thing
in
the
fire
and
sat
there
awhile
thinking
and
then
went
to
bed
myself
well
as
i
said
something
reminded
berri
of
that
night
and
as
we
were
on
a
deserted
road
far
from
cambridge
he
referred
to
it
at
first
and
afterwards
right
out
in
so
many
words
but
he
didn
t
talk
in
the
same
free
and
airy
strain
he
had
been
talking
in
before
and
although
i
wanted
to
hear
what
he
said
and
ask
questions
and
say
a
few
things
myself
i
had
a
feeling
all
the
time
that
perhaps
we
ought
to
change
the
subject
it
made
me
uncomfortable
then
i
thought
of
the
way
i
had
talked
to
duggie
the
first
evening
away
back
in
september
and
positively
blushed
when
i
remembered
that
i
had
asked
him
outright
how
one
ought
to
go
about
getting
on
clubs
why
that
was
enough
to
sewer
me
with
almost
anybody
in
the
world
but
duggie
imagine
my
doing
such
a
thing
now
no
one
ever
thinks
of
mentioning
the
clubs
in
general
conversation
of
course
once
in
a
while
some
fresh
kid
who
happens
to
live
next
door
to
one
of
them
comes
out
with
an
allusion
of
some
kind
and
embarrasses
everybody
to
death
and
i
ve
had
one
or
two
upper
or
hadn
t
made
the
dickey
and
didn
t
belong
to
a
club
talk
to
me
quite
freely
about
the
whole
matter
in
a
tone
that
implied
that
such
things
were
all
very
well
no
doubt
but
did
n
t
interest
them
particularly
you
can
get
a
good
deal
of
information
from
upper
classmen
of
this
kind
who
are
n
t
on
clubs
and
have
given
up
expecting
to
be
they
don
t
think
you
fresh
but
it
would
never
do
to
ask
for
any
from
a
dickey
man
that
would
be
awful
why
you
d
never
be
taken
on
if
you
did
that
even
berri
does
n
t
seem
to
know
much
about
the
dickey
or
if
he
does
he
did
n
t
tell
me
anything
very
definite
he
said
though
that
if
you
didn
t
make
it
you
might
just
as
well
pack
up
and
go
home
that
dickey
men
kind
of
flocked
together
and
did
n
t
go
outside
much
for
their
friends
and
that
the
fellows
you
wanted
to
know
usually
were
on
the
dickey
then
too
he
said
that
if
a
man
did
n
t
make
the
dickey
he
wasn
t
likely
to
be
taken
into
a
club
berri
seemed
to
know
a
lot
about
the
clubs
i
knew
hardly
anything
at
all
in
fact
i
thought
the
dickey
was
a
club
but
he
says
it
isn
t
it
s
a
society
the
clubs
he
says
are
great
his
uncle
took
him
to
one
for
breakfast
once
before
into
college
of
course
he
couldn
t
be
taken
to
one
now
he
said
he
did
n
t
notice
anything
particularly
secret
about
it
it
was
just
like
one
of
the
good
clubs
in
town
i
found
out
the
names
of
most
of
them
from
seem
to
have
greek
names
yet
are
called
by
queer
nicknames
as
a
where
they
are
this
last
however
i
knew
pretty
well
before
but
i
did
n
t
know
which
was
which
and
could
n
t
ask
exactly
i
had
often
seen
fellows
going
in
and
out
of
certain
houses
along
mount
auburn
street
that
did
n
t
look
like
residences
somehow
although
they
might
have
been
and
wondered
just
what
they
were
at
night
even
with
the
shades
down
they
were
always
lighted
from
top
to
bottom
no
matter
how
late
it
was
the
lights
were
there
cheerful
and
inviting
in
itself
seemed
remarkable
when
i
considered
how
early
cambridge
the
town
i
mean
goes
to
bed
but
one
morning
when
i
was
hurrying
to
a
lecture
two
fellows
came
out
of
claverly
hall
and
one
of
them
said
to
the
other
hold
up
a
minute
i
left
my
at
the
club
and
dashed
across
the
street
then
it
suddenly
dawned
on
me
of
course
i
never
look
curiously
at
them
any
more
but
just
walk
right
on
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
something
in
the
distance
as
if
they
were
ordinary
houses
i
can
t
help
wondering
sometimes
whether
anybody
ever
noticed
me
staring
at
them
and
at
the
fellows
going
in
and
i
knew
i
hope
not
when
i
asked
duggie
about
getting
into
clubs
that
time
i
remember
he
evaded
the
subject
which
was
darned
good
of
him
it
seems
to
me
now
by
saying
something
about
being
polite
to
everybody
that
s
all
very
well
berri
answered
when
i
laughed
a
little
and
told
him
about
it
but
there
s
such
a
thing
as
being
too
polite
you
see
there
are
fellows
right
now
in
our
know
who
they
are
and
i
do
are
even
as
early
as
this
being
considered
for
the
first
ten
if
you
suddenly
turned
in
and
tried
to
make
yourself
nice
to
them
why
everybody
would
say
you
were
swiping
and
so
you
would
be
the
first
ten
elects
the
second
ten
you
know
duggie
did
n
t
mean
that
you
ought
to
be
polite
only
to
the
fellows
you
think
are
going
to
help
you
along
i
answered
it
was
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
what
he
meant
was
that
you
ought
to
be
the
same
to
everybody
i
wonder
if
was
berri
mused
it
s
so
easy
after
you
ve
once
got
to
the
top
yourself
to
think
you
did
it
all
with
the
help
of
the
scriptures
it
s
like
these
old
vultures
who
ve
stolen
everything
in
sight
ever
since
they
were
born
beginning
their
magazine
articles
on
how
to
get
rich
with
honesty
and
industry
must
be
the
motto
of
him
who
would
attain
wealth
i
refused
to
see
any
connection
between
duggie
and
the
old
vultures
and
tried
to
get
back
to
the
clubs
however
we
did
n
t
say
much
more
about
them
and
squabbled
most
of
the
way
home
over
the
subject
of
popularity
it
does
seem
queer
that
some
fellows
have
so
many
friends
while
others
who
start
with
about
the
same
opportunities
and
even
greater
natural
advantages
now
and
then
have
so
few
i
suggested
that
when
a
fellow
was
tremendously
popular
and
in
i
could
n
t
see
why
it
was
probably
had
very
interesting
or
fascinating
qualities
that
i
had
n
t
perhaps
discovered
berri
however
maintained
that
popularity
was
often
nothing
but
an
idiotic
fashion
and
mentioned
several
popular
fellows
he
did
n
t
like
to
prove
it
now
look
at
tucker
ludlow
he
burst
out
what
is
he
a
dissipated
little
beast
you
know
he
is
everybody
knows
he
is
not
that
i
should
mind
his
being
dissipated
and
a
beast
if
he
were
ever
anything
else
but
he
isn
t
he
s
stupid
and
he
s
ignorant
and
he
is
n
t
even
yet
he
moves
in
a
crowd
nice
crowd
too
and
when
he
moves
the
crowd
moves
with
him
that
s
nothing
but
fashion
it
is
n
t
possible
that
anybody
can
really
like
the
creature
but
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
i
ve
already
heard
it
kind
of
whispered
around
that
he
ll
be
on
the
first
ten
what
berri
said
interested
me
very
much
for
ludlow
and
i
had
agreed
a
few
days
before
to
grind
together
on
a
course
for
the
exams
i
had
intended
to
remind
him
of
it
but
now
that
berri
said
he
was
spoken
of
for
the
first
ten
i
don
t
like
to
people
might
think
i
was
swiping
i
don
t
care
much
for
ludlow
myself
but
he
doesn
t
irritate
me
the
way
he
does
berri
and
i
do
think
there
must
be
something
to
him
after
the
freaks
of
fashion
berri
seemed
to
think
that
the
most
popular
one
s
freshman
year
the
fellows
whose
opportunities
for
making
friends
were
good
to
begin
with
and
who
were
n
t
in
any
way
particularly
startling
of
course
always
excepted
athletes
never
lack
a
following
but
it
does
n
t
do
he
says
to
be
different
or
to
excel
at
first
in
much
of
anything
else
you
may
with
perfect
safety
have
the
reputation
for
knowing
things
or
being
clever
but
that
s
very
different
from
really
knowing
or
being
the
man
who
actually
knows
or
is
is
doomed
what
about
reggie
howard
then
i
asked
everybody
likes
howard
and
yet
he
knows
a
fearful
amount
and
is
as
clever
as
any
one
could
be
i
knew
berri
thought
so
and
wondered
how
he
would
get
out
of
it
yes
reggie
s
wise
wise
he
admitted
but
with
the
exception
of
you
and
me
almost
no
one
suspects
it
he
does
n
t
object
to
my
knowing
because
he
feels
sure
i
don
t
mind
and
you
re
safe
because
you
re
so
kind
but
he
takes
care
that
people
generally
don
t
get
on
to
it
that
s
part
of
his
wisdom
one
thing
i
ve
learned
here
that
surprised
me
a
good
deal
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
money
i
always
had
an
idea
that
people
with
money
to
throw
to
the
birds
could
n
t
help
being
liked
but
that
evidently
is
n
t
the
case
and
berri
did
n
t
have
to
tell
me
i
found
it
out
for
myself
of
course
it
s
nice
to
be
able
to
live
in
comfortable
rooms
and
have
plenty
to
eat
and
wear
decent
clothes
no
one
objects
to
that
and
no
one
objects
apparently
to
a
fellow
s
doing
more
than
that
spending
indeed
a
good
deal
of
money
if
he
has
it
to
spend
but
the
mere
fact
of
a
man
s
having
a
allowance
does
n
t
seem
to
interest
people
in
the
least
and
if
some
frightfully
rich
fellow
comes
to
college
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
in
the
sunday
papers
about
his
father
s
income
and
how
many
horses
he
intends
to
keep
and
how
much
the
furnishing
of
his
rooms
will
probably
cost
it
s
decidedly
against
him
i
was
thinking
i
suppose
of
tony
earle
in
our
class
his
father
makes
millions
and
millions
out
of
believe
it
is
anyhow
everybody
speaks
of
tony
as
his
matchesty
and
has
very
little
to
do
with
him
the
fellows
are
simply
prejudiced
against
him
because
the
papers
said
he
had
so
much
money
and
he
s
really
a
perfectly
harmless
rather
quiet
sort
of
person
who
plays
well
on
the
piano
berri
and
i
spent
an
evening
with
him
once
we
were
dining
in
town
and
earle
was
all
alone
across
the
room
he
looked
so
dreary
that
berri
finally
exclaimed
for
heaven
s
sake
why
doesn
t
some
one
take
pity
on
that
poor
wretched
millionaire
it
s
positively
pathetic
i
suggested
asking
him
to
come
over
and
have
his
dinner
with
us
but
berri
like
every
one
else
objected
he
d
probably
order
nightingales
or
peacocks
or
some
such
thing
and
then
insist
on
paying
for
us
he
said
well
let
s
ask
him
and
see
i
urged
we
ll
make
that
the
test
if
he
tries
to
pay
the
whole
bill
he
won
t
do
so
berri
went
over
and
asked
him
to
join
us
and
he
turned
out
just
as
i
said
and
not
especially
interesting
but
a
good
deal
nicer
than
a
lot
of
fellows
who
won
t
know
him
when
it
came
to
paying
the
waiter
berri
kicked
me
under
the
table
and
spent
an
indecently
long
time
in
looking
over
the
check
i
think
he
was
actually
disappointed
when
earle
glanced
across
the
table
and
merely
said
by
the
way
what
s
my
share
when
we
got
to
cambridge
he
asked
us
over
to
his
rooms
they
certainly
are
dreams
even
berri
could
n
t
find
anything
wrong
with
them
he
bangs
the
box
like
a
wizard
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
say
he
was
lonely
or
something
melodramatic
like
that
when
we
got
up
to
leave
and
he
asked
us
to
come
again
berri
remarked
on
the
way
home
of
course
he
is
horribly
lonely
and
it
was
very
considerate
of
him
not
to
spoil
everything
by
saying
so
i
think
we
ll
have
to
go
back
at
luncheon
we
can
start
a
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
millionaires
well
if
i
m
ever
ostracized
it
won
t
be
because
people
are
scared
at
my
allowance
papa
and
i
have
been
having
an
exceedingly
brisk
correspondence
lately
just
after
the
family
got
back
to
perugia
mildred
wrote
me
that
papa
had
won
an
important
lawsuit
and
was
going
to
get
an
unusually
large
fee
so
i
bought
some
clothes
and
a
few
things
i
really
needed
on
the
strength
of
it
and
had
the
bill
sent
home
as
he
made
me
promise
to
let
him
know
just
what
i
spent
he
replied
at
some
length
declaring
among
other
things
that
i
reminded
him
of
what
charles
lamb
says
of
a
poor
relation
lamb
s
remark
being
a
poor
relation
is
a
preposterous
shadow
lengthening
in
the
noontide
of
your
prosperity
i
expostulated
and
told
him
about
willie
jackson
willie
s
elder
brother
passed
through
boston
not
long
ago
and
when
willie
went
in
to
see
him
he
asked
for
money
with
which
to
buy
a
case
and
some
shoes
he
needed
badly
no
one
knows
exactly
how
it
happened
think
that
willie
had
been
brooding
over
the
fine
arts
course
he
is
taking
and
the
instructor
s
plea
for
more
beauty
in
one
s
environment
anyhow
when
willie
stepped
off
the
car
in
cambridge
he
the
shoes
and
the
case
but
a
palm
and
a
to
this
papa
replied
that
he
didn
t
see
why
i
had
taken
the
trouble
to
record
for
his
benefit
the
exploits
of
willie
jackson
as
he
never
for
a
moment
had
doubted
that
there
were
as
many
fools
in
college
as
elsewhere
that
is
where
the
matter
rests
at
present
as
there
is
nothing
doing
now
that
you
can
watch
in
the
afternoon
as
you
can
the
football
practice
in
the
autumn
and
the
baseball
and
crews
in
the
spring
some
of
us
at
the
table
have
become
athletes
on
our
own
account
we
go
to
the
gym
every
day
at
about
five
and
work
with
and
dumbbells
and
are
put
through
all
sorts
of
agonizing
performances
in
a
large
class
of
hard
students
who
never
take
any
other
kind
of
exercise
then
we
run
up
north
avenue
as
far
as
the
and
back
to
our
rooms
i
don
t
know
how
far
it
is
but
the
return
trip
at
first
seemed
to
be
about
a
hundred
miles
it
s
a
little
shorter
now
and
gets
shorter
every
day
after
a
hot
and
then
a
cold
one
you
feel
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
walk
through
the
square
to
dinner
sticking
out
your
chest
it
s
queer
you
don
t
catch
cold
running
in
the
icy
wind
with
literally
nothing
on
but
a
pair
of
tennis
shoes
loose
short
cotton
drawers
and
a
thin
sleeveless
undershirt
but
you
never
seem
to
the
gym
made
me
stiff
all
over
for
a
day
or
two
but
i
feel
fine
now
and
wonder
why
we
never
thought
of
it
before
the
muckers
on
the
avenue
bother
us
a
good
deal
with
snowballs
when
we
run
hemington
very
foolishly
chased
one
of
them
not
long
ago
and
washed
his
face
with
snow
the
paternal
mucker
has
since
sued
hemi
for
assault
and
battery
hemi
is
in
a
great
state
about
it
and
we
are
all
looking
forward
to
cutting
a
morningful
of
lectures
and
testifying
in
court
the
are
almost
here
and
i
feel
as
if
it
were
only
about
the
day
before
yesterday
that
i
was
failing
in
the
hour
exams
i
simply
must
do
well
in
the
for
if
i
don
t
they
will
probably
change
my
probation
to
special
probation
as
it
is
called
which
is
the
limit
my
adviser
says
of
everything
obnoxious
i
should
have
to
him
most
morning
at
eight
just
to
show
that
i
was
up
bright
and
early
and
in
sympathy
with
the
work
so
to
speak
then
at
ten
or
eleven
in
the
evening
i
should
have
to
drop
in
again
which
of
course
would
make
it
impossible
to
go
to
the
theatre
without
permission
an
lookout
would
be
kept
on
my
work
and
altogether
special
probation
is
easily
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
avoided
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
grind
and
grind
night
and
day
in
order
to
get
everything
down
cold
i
wish
now
that
i
had
kept
on
studying
an
hour
or
two
every
day
as
i
did
for
about
a
week
after
my
encounter
with
the
exams
in
october
i
should
n
t
be
well
prepared
even
then
but
it
would
n
t
all
seem
so
perfectly
hopeless
as
it
does
now
it
s
so
hard
though
to
do
anything
regularly
when
the
front
door
is
unlocked
most
of
the
time
as
ours
is
and
there
s
no
use
in
locking
the
door
of
my
room
as
the
fellows
don
t
knock
once
and
go
away
but
pound
and
rattle
and
shout
insulting
remarks
through
the
keyhole
all
of
which
makes
me
feel
disagreeable
and
rather
affected
myself
up
when
other
people
get
along
so
well
without
that
sort
of
thing
i
have
n
t
done
it
more
than
once
or
twice
anyhow
i
ll
probably
get
a
good
mark
in
my
english
composition
the
instructor
seems
to
like
my
themes
and
reads
a
good
many
of
them
in
class
lately
however
he
has
developed
the
unnecessary
trick
of
pronouncing
the
words
when
he
is
reading
exactly
as
they
are
spelled
which
is
extremely
trying
for
me
and
not
fair
to
the
theme
it
has
made
several
really
good
ones
sound
ridiculous
spelling
is
n
t
my
strong
point
i
know
but
i
draw
the
line
at
berri
s
guying
me
about
it
whose
spelling
unless
he
digs
every
other
word
out
of
the
dictionary
looks
like
some
kind
of
absurd
french
dialect
he
has
recently
taken
to
getting
off
a
rigmarole
it
s
supposed
to
be
about
me
that
begins
something
like
this
berri
how
do
you
spell
parallel
why
of
thank
you
that
s
the
way
i
have
then
nothing
was
heard
but
the
scratching
of
a
penknife
i
think
they
re
rather
fussy
about
details
here
on
the
back
of
my
last
theme
the
instructor
wrote
by
the
way
dotting
one
s
s
and
crossing
one
s
s
are
charming
literary
habits
when
once
acquired
however
i
think
i
shall
get
a
good
mark
in
this
course
notwithstanding
but
life
isn
t
all
english
composition
and
i
have
a
terrible
amount
of
work
to
do
in
the
other
things
berri
and
i
began
in
a
way
to
prepare
for
the
ordeal
by
going
to
the
theatre
for
the
last
time
until
the
period
is
at
an
end
we
made
an
occasion
of
it
and
ended
by
doing
something
that
i
had
never
dreamed
we
were
going
to
do
when
we
started
out
it
was
foolish
i
suppose
and
i
don
t
know
exactly
what
mamma
would
think
about
it
i
should
like
to
tell
her
and
find
out
but
i
m
afraid
papa
might
get
hold
of
it
and
my
idea
of
his
opinion
on
the
subject
is
somewhat
less
vague
what
we
did
was
to
invite
one
of
the
girls
in
the
show
to
supper
berri
proposed
it
we
were
sitting
in
the
front
row
away
to
one
side
and
when
the
second
act
was
about
half
over
he
exclaimed
to
me
there
she
s
done
it
again
that
s
the
third
time
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
and
he
replied
that
one
of
the
girls
on
our
side
of
the
stage
had
winked
at
us
the
attention
he
explained
must
have
been
meant
for
us
and
for
a
variety
of
reasons
it
did
n
t
seem
as
if
it
could
have
been
intended
for
any
one
else
in
the
first
place
our
seats
were
the
last
in
the
row
behind
us
were
some
ladies
and
on
the
other
side
of
berri
was
a
very
old
man
who
sat
half
turned
away
from
the
stage
holding
a
great
black
tin
trumpet
to
his
ear
as
if
he
were
expecting
the
actors
to
lean
over
the
footlights
and
pour
something
into
it
i
don
t
want
to
appear
vain
berri
went
on
but
as
a
mere
matter
of
geographical
position
i
think
that
we
re
it
the
comedian
was
singing
a
song
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
and
on
either
side
of
him
was
a
row
of
girls
they
were
supposed
to
joined
in
the
chorus
at
the
end
of
every
verse
and
shook
their
fingers
at
him
reprovingly
they
were
all
dressed
in
tights
this
was
n
t
the
convent
uniform
they
had
appeared
in
that
during
the
first
act
and
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
had
been
rehearsing
for
private
theatricals
when
the
comedian
fell
in
through
the
window
the
comedian
was
a
burglar
and
tights
were
merely
a
clever
disguise
he
was
making
the
girls
believe
that
he
was
a
professional
actor
hired
by
the
mother
superior
to
teach
them
how
to
sing
and
dance
this
was
the
plot
and
it
was
really
rather
complicated
for
when
they
all
decided
to
leave
the
convent
with
the
burglar
and
spend
the
evening
at
a
they
rushed
in
dressed
as
policemen
pretending
that
they
had
come
to
arrest
the
burglar
the
mother
superior
did
n
t
recognize
them
of
course
and
was
naturally
glad
to
have
the
burglar
taken
away
then
at
the
the
third
appeared
as
waiters
all
of
which
made
it
hard
for
me
to
keep
track
of
them
very
well
but
berri
could
spot
our
girl
every
time
and
by
carefully
examining
the
program
and
comparing
the
names
of
the
chorus
with
the
various
changes
of
costume
she
went
through
he
managed
in
some
way
by
the
end
of
the
second
act
to
discover
her
name
it
was
miss
mae
ysobelle
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
n
t
think
her
particularly
pretty
she
was
tall
and
not
a
bit
graceful
and
when
she
danced
she
looked
as
if
it
were
hard
work
to
move
her
arms
and
legs
the
right
number
of
times
and
finish
with
the
others
she
smiled
a
great
deal
but
the
moment
she
stopped
dancing
her
mouth
sort
of
snapped
back
to
place
as
if
it
were
made
of
stiff
red
rubber
i
found
after
watching
her
for
a
long
time
that
my
own
mouth
got
very
tired
i
told
berri
this
also
that
her
clothes
looked
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
some
one
else
but
berri
somehow
seemed
to
think
she
might
be
unusually
agreeable
if
one
knew
her
very
often
you
know
really
pretty
people
don
t
make
up
well
at
all
and
as
for
her
clothes
looking
as
if
they
did
n
t
belong
to
her
why
she
can
t
help
that
poor
thing
they
probably
don
t
she
is
a
little
but
you
would
n
t
notice
that
if
she
had
a
skirt
on
well
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
any
immediate
danger
of
our
seeing
her
with
a
skirt
i
answered
for
some
of
the
convent
ysobelle
among
suddenly
changed
their
minds
about
being
waiters
and
had
decided
to
give
the
interrupted
private
theatricals
right
there
on
the
stage
they
came
prancing
in
dressed
as
jockeys
while
the
man
in
the
orchestra
who
as
berri
says
supplies
music
with
local
color
slapped
two
thin
boards
together
to
imitate
the
crack
of
a
whip
oh
i
don
t
know
berri
mused
we
might
manage
to
meet
her
after
the
show
her
to
supper
or
something
she
seems
friendly
enough
he
added
for
as
he
was
speaking
the
jockeys
drew
up
at
the
edge
of
the
stage
touched
their
caps
then
leaned
over
and
winked
miss
ysobelle
was
unmistakably
looking
at
us
as
she
did
it
i
did
n
t
believe
she
would
go
with
us
even
if
we
asked
her
but
berri
said
we
d
rush
out
after
the
third
act
and
buy
her
some
flowers
and
send
an
usher
behind
the
scenes
with
them
we
ended
by
doing
got
her
a
big
box
of
writing
a
note
asking
her
to
meet
us
at
the
stage
door
when
the
performance
was
ended
berri
signed
it
front
left
we
did
n
t
get
an
answer
to
it
at
least
not
in
words
but
when
the
curtain
went
up
again
on
a
scene
in
the
convent
garden
miss
ysobelle
had
one
of
our
roses
in
her
hair
and
another
at
her
belt
and
i
began
to
feel
excited
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
her
in
fact
the
whole
last
act
had
a
personal
interest
for
us
that
the
others
had
not
it
was
almost
like
being
on
the
stage
and
enjoying
everything
from
the
inside
i
even
felt
rather
sorry
for
the
rest
of
the
audience
who
were
sitting
there
perfectly
oblivious
to
the
intrigue
going
on
in
the
blaze
of
the
footlights
before
their
unsuspecting
eyes
one
thing
struck
us
both
as
rather
odd
at
first
miss
ysobelle
except
for
the
roses
scrupulously
ignored
us
through
the
entire
act
she
not
only
never
winked
at
us
she
never
even
looked
at
us
in
fact
she
gave
us
both
the
impression
that
she
had
become
absorbed
in
something
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
i
could
n
t
understand
this
and
neither
could
berri
although
he
said
there
was
probably
some
theatrical
etiquette
connected
with
her
averted
gaze
or
perhaps
the
had
told
her
to
be
more
dignified
we
decided
to
ask
her
about
it
at
supper
well
we
never
got
a
chance
to
ask
her
but
we
found
out
soon
enough
for
ourselves
as
we
had
the
last
seats
on
the
left
side
of
the
front
row
we
were
naturally
the
last
to
get
into
the
middle
aisle
on
the
way
out
or
rather
we
and
the
people
who
had
the
corresponding
seats
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
were
the
last
we
met
them
when
we
reached
the
end
of
our
row
and
had
to
stop
a
moment
as
they
stood
there
putting
on
their
overcoats
and
blocking
the
way
one
of
them
i
noticed
particularly
great
big
thug
of
a
creature
who
had
shiny
black
hair
slicked
up
in
front
with
a
barbery
flourish
and
a
very
fancy
waistcoat
and
cravat
they
kept
just
ahead
of
us
on
the
way
out
and
laughed
a
good
deal
berri
and
i
were
unusually
silent
we
did
n
t
go
quite
to
the
stage
door
as
the
electric
light
fizzing
right
over
it
made
everything
in
the
little
alley
as
bright
as
day
neither
of
us
was
very
keen
to
join
the
group
loitering
near
by
so
we
stood
a
little
back
in
the
shadow
and
waited
finally
some
men
with
their
collars
turned
up
came
out
then
two
women
with
thick
veils
on
they
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
and
for
a
few
seconds
we
were
afraid
that
one
of
them
might
be
miss
ysobelle
but
we
remembered
how
tall
she
was
and
did
n
t
run
after
them
then
more
men
came
and
more
girls
of
whom
were
joined
by
men
waiting
at
the
door
it
seemed
at
last
as
if
the
whole
company
must
have
come
out
and
berri
and
i
were
beginning
to
think
that
miss
mae
ysobelle
must
have
left
before
we
arrived
when
the
door
opened
once
more
and
she
appeared
with
our
box
of
flowers
in
her
arms
for
a
moment
she
stood
on
the
step
and
looked
around
expectantly
i
think
we
ought
to
go
up
berri
murmured
nervously
but
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
wait
and
join
her
as
she
passed
by
then
a
queer
thing
happened
just
as
she
decided
to
leave
the
step
who
should
go
up
to
her
but
the
big
thug
with
the
shiny
hair
and
loud
waistcoat
he
lifted
his
hat
and
shook
hands
with
her
very
cordially
then
took
the
box
of
strolled
away
with
her
out
of
the
alley
to
the
street
as
they
passed
by
we
heard
her
exclaim
say
it
was
awful
nice
of
you
to
send
those
jacques
when
myrtle
seen
me
open
the
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
the
rattle
of
a
cab
berri
and
i
waited
a
moment
before
coming
out
of
the
shadow
then
we
looked
at
each
other
and
berri
shrieked
with
laughter
we
laughed
all
the
way
back
to
cambridge
the
people
in
the
car
must
have
don
t
know
what
they
could
have
thought
for
a
long
time
we
could
n
t
imagine
why
things
had
turned
out
as
they
had
until
berri
remembered
that
he
had
signed
the
note
front
left
he
had
meant
our
left
but
miss
ysobelle
no
doubt
thought
that
it
referred
to
her
left
was
quite
another
matter
i
ve
been
dead
to
the
world
for
more
than
a
month
it
seems
about
a
year
yet
when
i
came
to
look
at
the
situation
squarely
there
wasn
t
anything
else
to
do
exactly
it
was
a
case
of
getting
the
drop
on
my
exams
or
letting
them
get
the
drop
on
me
of
course
i
could
have
sort
of
fooled
with
them
and
thought
i
was
learning
something
about
them
and
then
perhaps
have
scraped
through
in
one
or
two
and
failed
in
the
others
and
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
the
way
in
which
tucker
ludlow
and
i
did
go
at
them
at
first
tucker
came
up
to
my
room
two
or
three
times
armed
with
some
notes
on
greek
architecture
that
he
had
bought
at
one
of
the
book
stores
in
the
square
the
first
time
he
came
was
rather
late
in
the
afternoon
he
examined
everything
in
my
room
and
we
talked
a
good
deal
he
had
been
out
west
once
and
seemed
to
know
much
more
about
that
part
of
the
country
than
i
did
however
we
finally
got
to
work
and
had
read
about
two
pages
of
the
notes
when
hemington
came
in
he
saw
that
we
were
grinding
and
said
he
would
n
t
sit
down
and
interrupt
us
especially
as
he
ought
to
be
in
his
own
room
grinding
himself
he
did
n
t
actually
sit
down
but
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
smoked
for
a
while
and
then
compromised
by
half
sitting
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
in
a
temporary
way
and
swinging
his
leg
when
at
last
he
got
up
to
leave
it
was
so
near
dinner
that
ludlow
went
with
him
and
said
he
would
continue
some
other
time
he
left
the
notes
with
me
and
at
first
i
thought
i
should
study
them
alone
but
as
ludlow
and
i
had
agreed
to
grind
the
course
up
together
there
did
n
t
seem
to
be
any
point
in
getting
ahead
of
him
so
in
a
few
minutes
i
went
to
dinner
myself
the
next
time
ludlow
came
to
study
was
in
the
evening
he
proposed
that
i
should
read
the
notes
aloud
as
he
found
the
architectural
terms
so
hard
to
pronounce
we
were
to
stop
and
talk
over
anything
we
did
n
t
understand
i
made
myself
comfortable
in
a
chair
near
the
lamp
and
ludlow
drew
up
to
the
fire
after
droning
along
for
about
ten
minutes
about
triglyphs
and
epistyles
and
entablatures
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
suddenly
had
a
jealous
feeling
that
he
was
getting
more
good
from
the
performance
than
i
was
for
he
had
n
t
asked
a
question
while
i
had
n
t
understood
a
single
sentence
finally
without
looking
up
i
said
tucker
if
you
really
know
what
means
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
tucker
didn
t
answer
and
i
thought
he
was
probably
trying
to
get
at
a
definition
simple
enough
for
me
to
grasp
but
when
i
glanced
over
toward
the
fireplace
i
saw
that
he
was
asleep
with
his
mouth
open
well
i
felt
rather
angry
at
first
all
seemed
such
a
waste
of
time
but
it
struck
me
too
as
being
funny
so
i
did
n
t
wake
him
he
must
have
slept
for
at
least
ten
minutes
longer
of
course
i
did
n
t
bother
about
reading
aloud
any
more
and
then
he
came
to
exclaiming
read
that
about
the
ground
plan
once
more
i
don
t
think
i
quite
got
that
as
the
ground
plan
was
almost
the
first
topic
mentioned
i
suppose
he
had
dozed
off
almost
immediately
after
that
i
made
him
do
the
reading
but
he
had
n
t
stumbled
through
many
pages
before
he
put
down
the
notes
and
said
granny
don
t
you
think
that
if
we
tackled
this
beastly
drivel
in
the
daytime
our
heads
would
be
clearer
that
was
the
end
of
our
grinding
together
he
came
to
my
room
once
more
but
i
was
out
it
was
after
this
experience
that
i
thought
the
matter
over
and
decided
i
should
have
to
do
the
thing
differently
and
for
the
most
part
alone
my
most
brilliant
stroke
was
getting
the
key
of
duggie
s
room
from
chester
i
could
lock
myself
up
there
and
be
perfectly
safe
when
fellows
saw
my
own
door
wide
open
and
no
one
at
home
they
went
away
at
once
without
making
a
row
of
course
i
had
to
let
berri
into
the
game
but
as
he
began
to
be
scared
about
some
of
his
own
exams
he
was
grateful
for
the
refuge
and
did
n
t
give
it
away
i
went
to
work
at
the
whole
business
scientifically
determined
not
to
leave
a
single
thing
however
unimportant
to
chance
and
i
m
convinced
now
that
if
i
have
the
nerve
always
to
do
this
i
can
get
through
any
examination
i
m
ever
likely
to
have
brilliantly
perhaps
but
very
respectably
first
of
all
i
spent
a
day
in
the
library
and
got
hold
of
a
lot
of
books
that
gave
my
various
courses
in
their
simplest
clearest
form
for
the
fine
arts
course
i
found
that
a
copy
of
the
notes
that
ludlow
had
was
better
than
anything
they
stated
facts
in
a
condensed
way
that
made
it
possible
to
keep
in
your
head
a
bird
view
of
the
entire
course
as
far
as
we
had
gone
then
i
made
a
list
of
the
number
of
pages
of
general
reading
we
had
to
accomplish
in
every
course
and
split
them
up
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
through
them
notes
as
i
reading
a
certain
number
of
pages
a
day
i
left
a
margin
at
the
end
for
review
and
in
case
of
accidents
and
finally
after
i
had
made
these
preparations
and
collected
as
many
of
the
necessary
books
as
i
could
i
had
to
do
some
of
my
reading
in
the
library
i
locked
duggie
s
door
one
morning
after
breakfast
and
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
stayed
there
until
luncheon
and
after
luncheon
i
went
back
and
stayed
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
gym
and
take
a
run
and
after
dinner
i
went
back
and
stayed
until
bedtime
and
i
did
this
every
day
with
very
few
interruptions
until
i
could
pick
up
any
of
the
turn
to
the
alphabetical
index
and
plough
right
through
it
describing
in
detail
every
darned
thing
it
mentioned
and
an
alphabetical
index
mentions
a
good
deal
if
i
slipped
up
on
anything
i
would
mark
it
with
a
pencil
go
back
and
learn
it
oh
it
was
perfectly
awful
i
got
so
tired
and
discouraged
and
maudlin
at
times
that
i
would
have
to
lean
back
and
close
my
eyes
and
let
my
bursting
mind
become
a
throbbing
blank
for
a
few
minutes
in
order
to
keep
from
screaming
but
after
the
gym
and
the
run
and
the
i
felt
all
right
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
two
physics
and
had
to
tutor
in
for
a
while
there
was
no
use
pegging
away
at
them
by
myself
for
i
simply
did
n
t
understand
some
of
the
experiments
and
logic
i
could
n
t
make
head
or
tail
of
a
senior
who
lived
in
college
house
explained
them
to
me
in
simple
golden
words
three
dollars
an
hour
were
his
terms
and
when
i
once
saw
through
it
all
and
had
it
down
on
paper
in
my
own
language
i
could
let
it
soak
in
at
home
the
other
ones
i
did
understand
like
history
and
fine
merely
a
matter
of
incessant
repetition
and
memory
the
night
before
the
fine
arts
exam
i
went
to
what
is
called
a
seminar
in
that
subject
i
could
have
got
along
very
well
without
it
after
my
days
and
days
of
slavery
but
about
every
one
i
knew
was
going
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
there
are
several
men
here
who
make
a
business
of
boiling
popular
courses
down
to
their
most
painlessly
swallowable
dimensions
and
then
giving
the
thing
the
evening
before
the
examination
in
a
kind
of
lecture
for
which
they
charge
an
admittance
fee
of
three
or
four
dollars
this
performance
is
a
seminar
kind
of
royal
road
if
not
to
learning
at
least
to
passing
examinations
they
say
that
fellows
who
never
look
at
a
book
or
take
a
note
in
class
often
go
to
a
seminar
and
providing
they
have
good
memories
are
able
to
answer
enough
questions
on
the
exam
paper
the
next
morning
to
get
through
with
colors
flying
a
certain
number
of
questions
on
almost
every
paper
simply
have
to
deal
with
cold
isolated
facts
rather
than
with
the
generalities
comparisons
and
discussions
that
necessitate
a
real
knowledge
of
the
subject
and
it
is
with
these
in
at
a
one
puts
up
a
successful
bluff
the
authorities
naturally
object
to
all
this
as
berri
remarked
about
the
seminar
we
went
to
after
a
professor
has
earnestly
expounded
a
subject
for
half
a
year
it
must
make
him
rather
sore
to
have
a
cheeky
parrot
get
up
and
do
the
whole
thing
much
better
in
four
hours
the
fine
arts
seminar
was
held
in
a
huge
room
almost
a
hall
in
a
kind
of
office
building
near
the
square
it
was
advertised
to
begin
at
seven
and
pretty
much
every
one
was
there
on
time
the
sports
of
the
freshman
and
sophomore
classes
some
juniors
and
even
a
few
seniors
it
was
what
the
society
reporter
refers
to
as
a
large
and
fashionable
gathering
it
certainly
was
a
mighty
crowd
of
fellows
clean
well
dressed
and
to
quote
berri
much
more
intelligent
in
appearance
than
we
actually
are
or
we
should
n
t
be
here
at
all
as
every
man
came
in
he
was
given
a
large
sheet
of
stiff
paper
on
which
was
printed
a
synopsis
of
the
course
with
all
the
subjects
that
had
been
touched
on
methodically
arranged
and
a
list
of
definitions
simple
and
easily
remembered
but
adequate
it
was
greek
art
in
a
nutshell
perfect
marvel
of
clearness
and
condensation
the
little
folding
chairs
had
been
neatly
arranged
in
a
semicircle
at
first
but
by
the
time
the
fellows
had
taken
possession
of
them
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
thrown
in
at
random
a
good
many
men
who
were
evidently
old
hands
at
the
business
arranged
themselves
comfortably
in
two
chairs
leaning
back
in
one
with
their
legs
stretched
across
another
as
if
prepared
to
spend
the
night
a
lot
of
them
took
off
their
coats
and
crowd
and
the
gas
made
the
already
overheated
room
unbearably
i
ve
never
seen
so
many
pretty
shirts
in
my
life
as
i
did
that
evening
after
every
one
was
settled
the
man
who
was
giving
the
seminar
took
a
chair
on
a
little
platform
in
front
of
us
and
to
talk
exactly
but
to
drone
he
had
a
harsh
monotonous
voix
trainante
berri
called
spoke
with
painful
slowness
as
if
trying
not
to
emphasize
any
one
topic
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
had
the
effect
of
making
his
entire
discourse
from
beginning
to
end
horribly
important
except
for
this
crawling
sound
the
room
was
absolutely
silent
for
once
nobody
seemed
conscious
of
himself
or
of
any
one
else
even
when
the
man
on
the
platform
pronounced
greek
words
in
a
novel
fashion
that
was
all
his
own
there
was
n
t
a
smile
i
don
t
think
we
realized
the
intense
strain
of
attention
we
were
undergoing
until
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
three
quarters
tucker
ludlow
who
had
gone
to
sleep
fell
off
his
chair
the
second
or
two
of
relaxation
that
followed
the
crash
was
exquisite
we
stretched
our
arms
and
swabbed
our
foreheads
with
our
handkerchiefs
and
then
sank
back
again
for
another
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
until
the
bell
in
the
tower
of
memorial
boomed
out
ten
o
clock
this
seemed
to
be
the
signal
for
a
short
vacation
for
the
on
the
platform
finished
the
sentence
he
had
begun
and
then
stood
up
there
was
a
general
shuffling
of
chairs
and
a
babbling
of
voices
and
the
crowd
divided
into
chattering
groups
some
of
the
fellows
did
n
t
seem
to
know
anybody
and
they
either
went
out
and
strolled
up
and
down
the
corridor
or
sat
studying
the
synopsis
the
host
of
the
evening
had
provided
beer
and
ginger
ale
and
cheese
and
crackers
with
which
to
sustain
life
until
the
ordeal
was
over
he
could
well
afford
it
as
there
were
at
least
men
in
the
room
every
one
of
whom
would
deposit
three
dollars
and
a
half
before
he
left
while
berri
and
i
and
most
of
our
table
were
talking
in
a
corner
a
fellow
named
smith
a
sophomore
sauntered
over
to
us
berri
and
i
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
him
so
of
course
he
must
have
come
just
to
speak
to
us
i
don
t
remember
what
he
said
exactly
as
the
conversation
of
the
others
sort
of
faded
away
when
he
approached
and
berri
and
i
were
fearfully
rattled
he
s
very
prominent
and
belongs
to
everything
after
we
had
stood
there
for
a
minute
or
two
hemington
and
bertie
stockbridge
and
the
others
drifted
off
leaving
us
three
together
and
in
a
moment
more
berri
said
i
m
going
over
to
get
another
cracker
and
also
left
us
i
happened
to
notice
that
he
did
n
t
go
near
the
crackers
and
furthermore
he
never
came
back
this
seemed
so
queer
and
unlike
berri
that
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
on
the
way
home
and
asked
him
why
he
had
done
it
he
answered
by
saying
you
don
t
have
to
be
much
of
a
fox
to
know
when
you
re
wanted
and
when
you
re
not
and
that
happened
to
be
one
of
the
times
when
i
wasn
t
this
struck
me
as
absurd
and
does
still
berri
knew
smith
every
bit
as
well
as
i
did
for
the
only
other
time
he
had
ever
spoken
to
us
we
happened
to
be
together
just
as
we
were
the
night
of
the
seminar
i
reminded
berri
of
this
but
he
only
laughed
a
little
and
replied
well
as
fleetwood
says
i
m
an
old
man
and
i
know
my
since
then
smith
has
joined
me
twice
when
i
was
walking
through
the
yard
and
seemed
very
friendly
in
a
distant
kind
of
way
i
mean
that
his
joining
me
at
all
was
friendly
he
is
n
t
much
of
a
talker
and
i
never
know
quite
what
to
say
to
him
of
course
it
s
very
nice
in
him
to
do
it
but
it
makes
me
rather
uncomfortable
for
both
times
we
stopped
a
moment
on
the
steps
of
bell
had
n
t
rung
although
there
were
a
lot
of
fellows
i
knew
waiting
to
go
in
they
merely
nodded
to
me
and
then
looked
away
but
i
m
forgetting
about
the
seminar
we
went
back
to
our
chairs
again
and
once
more
tuned
our
ears
to
the
monotonous
voice
of
the
lecturer
that
dragged
on
and
on
till
midnight
it
became
harder
and
harder
to
take
in
everything
he
said
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smoke
of
egyptian
cigarettes
and
i
counted
nine
men
who
were
sound
asleep
i
suppose
that
even
though
asleep
they
were
more
likely
to
acquire
a
fact
or
two
than
if
they
hadn
t
been
there
at
all
just
at
the
can
hear
him
man
on
the
platform
leaned
back
wearily
with
closed
eyes
and
chanted
in
the
same
hopeless
tone
let
me
once
more
urge
upon
you
the
importance
of
expressing
in
your
examination
papers
sympathy
with
the
greek
life
the
greek
art
and
the
greek
ideals
of
the
best
period
a
page
or
two
of
sincere
regret
that
we
moderns
do
not
possess
the
innate
sense
of
beauty
the
joy
of
life
civic
pride
harmony
and
all
the
other
things
that
the
greeks
went
in
for
will
help
you
to
get
a
passing
mark
remember
what
i
told
you
about
greek
sophrosúne
refer
to
greek
sophrosúne
constantly
john
addington
symonds
calls
it
that
truly
greek
virtue
the
correlative
in
morals
to
the
passion
for
and
there
are
two
in
addington
if
you
get
stuck
make
use
of
the
quotation
i
gave
you
from
comes
in
well
almost
anywhere
and
good
luck
he
stood
at
the
door
as
we
passed
out
holding
a
box
in
his
hand
into
which
every
one
dropped
three
plunks
and
a
half
i
was
tired
when
we
got
home
and
went
right
to
bed
but
berri
sat
up
almost
until
morning
studying
the
synopsis
and
going
over
his
notes
it
must
have
been
some
time
before
this
that
berri
s
thesis
arrived
from
england
one
morning
with
a
long
letter
from
duggie
i
have
kept
a
sort
of
lookout
for
it
right
along
but
that
morning
berri
saw
the
postman
from
my
window
and
ran
downstairs
to
meet
him
as
he
was
coming
up
he
exclaimed
in
a
surprised
voice
what
on
earth
do
you
and
then
broke
off
abruptly
he
passed
quickly
through
my
room
dropping
a
bill
on
my
desk
as
he
went
and
after
that
the
house
for
about
half
an
hour
was
very
silent
i
had
so
often
wondered
what
berri
would
do
what
he
would
say
how
he
would
take
duggie
s
letter
when
it
came
that
i
instinctively
knew
it
had
at
last
arrived
and
asked
no
questions
he
surprised
me
by
neither
saying
nor
doing
anything
and
for
two
days
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
thesis
had
wandered
back
to
cambridge
at
all
beyond
the
feeling
in
my
bones
that
it
had
on
the
third
day
however
berri
who
was
just
starting
off
to
spend
sunday
at
his
aunt
s
stopped
in
my
room
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
it
doubtfully
for
a
moment
as
if
making
up
his
mind
about
something
and
then
tossed
it
into
my
lap
i
got
that
from
sherwin
the
other
day
he
said
and
then
added
as
he
made
for
the
door
and
i
drew
the
letter
from
its
envelope
well
it
may
be
all
for
the
best
i
don
t
think
anybody
could
read
duggie
s
letter
and
not
feel
that
it
was
for
the
best
berri
has
n
t
said
anything
more
about
it
and
neither
have
i
there
really
is
n
t
anything
to
say
i
passed
all
my
exams
my
marks
are
n
t
anything
to
be
stuck
up
about
but
they
let
me
through
decently
and
in
three
courses
were
even
a
little
better
than
they
actually
had
to
be
is
a
comfort
in
a
way
for
my
adviser
says
he
thinks
that
in
a
few
weeks
it
would
n
t
do
any
harm
to
petition
the
administrative
board
or
whatever
it
is
that
has
charge
of
such
things
to
let
me
off
probation
he
says
he
can
t
promise
anything
of
course
but
that
stranger
things
have
happened
all
of
which
seems
to
me
rather
to
explode
berri
s
conviction
that
every
adviser
in
college
spends
all
his
odd
moments
in
devising
fiendish
schemes
for
the
destruction
of
his
freshmen
charges
but
then
berri
was
unfortunate
in
his
adviser
he
is
n
t
young
and
does
n
t
try
to
be
sympathetic
like
mine
and
he
annoys
berri
extremely
by
glaring
at
him
over
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
exclaiming
of
nothing
you
can
t
fool
can
t
fool
me
my
adviser
has
had
me
to
dinner
twice
at
the
professors
club
he
invites
his
freshmen
four
or
five
at
a
time
to
dinner
in
order
i
suppose
to
get
to
know
them
better
of
course
he
never
really
does
get
to
know
us
better
by
having
these
stiff
little
parties
but
it
s
awfully
kind
of
him
to
ask
us
and
he
thinks
he
does
so
it
s
all
right
i
dreaded
the
first
one
but
my
dread
was
n
t
a
patch
on
the
dread
with
which
i
dreaded
the
second
because
i
d
been
to
the
first
naturally
i
did
n
t
dare
refuse
to
go
to
either
of
them
nobody
does
the
dinner
itself
is
good
and
my
adviser
not
only
lays
himself
out
to
be
just
as
nice
as
possible
succeeds
yet
the
fellows
don
t
feel
altogether
at
their
ease
somehow
and
are
n
t
themselves
they
want
to
be
and
try
to
be
and
once
in
a
while
they
put
up
a
pretty
good
bluff
at
it
but
they
never
quite
are
i
don
t
know
how
to
explain
it
exactly
but
when
you
can
t
help
feeling
that
your
host
is
sizing
you
up
and
talking
only
about
the
things
he
thinks
you
like
to
talk
if
you
do
like
to
talk
about
them
why
you
just
can
t
i
ve
read
that
sentence
over
six
times
and
it
means
a
little
less
every
time
after
dinner
he
takes
the
fellows
up
to
his
room
and
asks
them
to
smoke
and
they
never
know
which
would
be
the
better
swipe
accept
or
to
refuse
some
decide
one
way
and
some
the
other
but
whether
they
want
to
smoke
or
not
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
decision
the
best
part
of
the
evening
comes
when
somebody
gets
up
enough
nerve
to
murmur
that
he
is
very
sorry
he
has
to
say
as
he
has
a
lot
of
studying
to
do
this
usually
makes
the
others
laugh
and
it
always
breaks
up
the
party
then
the
fellows
get
together
in
somebody
s
they
know
one
another
well
talk
the
thing
over
oh
i
wish
spring
would
come
this
seems
to
be
the
time
of
year
when
nothing
much
happens
as
long
as
we
were
all
grinding
most
of
the
day
for
the
i
didn
t
think
much
about
the
weather
except
that
when
it
was
bad
there
wasn
t
so
much
temptation
to
idle
out
of
doors
now
however
everybody
wants
the
weather
to
be
good
and
it
s
vile
it
always
manages
to
do
four
or
five
different
things
in
the
course
of
a
day
and
the
walking
is
unspeakable
to
a
certain
extent
though
this
is
the
fault
of
the
town
itself
most
of
the
residence
streets
have
dirt
sidewalks
and
curbstones
that
might
be
very
picturesque
in
egypt
or
some
place
where
it
did
n
t
rain
and
snow
and
freeze
and
melt
all
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
but
here
they
turn
into
troughs
full
of
mud
and
slush
and
the
curbstones
keep
the
mixture
from
running
into
the
gutter
i
know
i
ought
n
t
to
criticise
such
a
fine
old
town
so
many
great
people
have
all
their
lives
floundered
uncomplainingly
through
cambridge
mud
that
i
suppose
it
s
cheeky
of
me
to
notice
it
but
in
wet
weather
the
sidewalks
are
really
not
nice
in
front
of
a
few
houses
the
owners
put
down
temporary
wooden
walks
boards
wide
running
lengthwise
you
invariably
meet
a
lady
in
the
middle
of
them
and
have
to
jump
gracefully
into
the
nearest
puddle
looking
as
if
you
considered
this
the
dearest
privilege
of
your
young
life
the
candidates
for
the
track
team
are
crazy
to
get
out
of
doors
and
begin
regular
practice
on
the
soldiers
field
cinder
track
but
it
s
too
soft
yet
to
be
raked
and
rolled
and
they
have
to
keep
working
in
the
gym
and
on
the
tiresome
old
board
track
behind
it
dick
smith
was
talking
about
this
not
long
ago
when
he
joined
me
in
the
yard
he
says
it
s
great
on
a
warm
spring
morning
to
go
across
the
river
and
sit
on
the
bleachers
and
watch
the
fellows
practise
starting
and
short
sprints
well
there
s
nothing
like
that
now
i
hardly
know
how
the
days
go
by
i
notice
that
when
i
last
wrote
in
my
diary
i
was
wishing
for
spring
and
here
it
is
almost
the
end
of
june
where
did
all
those
slow
days
i
complained
of
go
to
so
quickly
i
wonder
how
did
i
spend
them
and
why
haven
t
i
tried
to
tell
about
them
i
don
t
know
unless
it
was
because
they
were
so
slow
and
did
go
so
quickly
nothing
ever
happened
really
until
just
at
the
end
but
with
cambridge
sizzling
hot
i
can
smell
the
asphalt
on
the
main
street
even
here
in
my
room
and
perfectly
deserted
except
for
its
inhabitants
who
don
t
count
and
the
kids
who
have
come
to
take
their
entrance
exams
the
last
three
months
and
a
half
seem
like
a
dream
the
spring
is
scarcely
over
and
yet
i
ve
already
begun
to
look
forward
to
it
again
next
year
i
liked
it
so
much
i
suppose
because
in
perugia
we
don
t
as
a
rule
have
any
out
there
it
s
very
much
like
what
you
read
about
russia
for
a
long
time
it
s
winter
and
then
you
wake
up
some
morning
feeling
as
if
you
had
spent
the
night
in
a
turkish
bath
and
know
that
it
is
summer
you
know
that
the
are
hissing
that
a
is
jolting
past
leaving
behind
it
a
damp
earthy
sensation
something
between
an
odor
and
a
faint
breeze
that
an
italian
is
leaning
over
the
fence
languidly
calling
out
that
a
is
in
the
distance
and
that
of
course
a
is
whirring
sharply
back
and
forth
under
your
windows
here
warm
weather
comes
slowly
and
shyly
as
if
it
could
n
t
quite
make
up
its
mind
to
come
at
all
there
are
many
days
that
from
the
other
side
of
a
pane
of
glass
look
all
blue
and
white
and
gold
and
tempt
you
to
snatch
up
a
cap
and
run
out
you
do
this
and
stand
undecidedly
on
the
sidewalk
for
a
moment
then
you
go
in
again
and
put
on
your
overcoat
and
gloves
somehow
the
leaves
don
t
seem
to
burst
out
all
at
once
as
they
do
with
us
you
notice
first
on
brattle
street
and
in
the
yard
that
the
trees
have
undergone
a
change
that
is
you
think
they
have
the
change
is
so
slight
you
aren
t
sure
and
may
have
only
imagined
it
after
all
but
in
a
few
can
t
now
remember
how
know
that
you
were
right
the
branches
and
twigs
that
have
stood
out
so
hard
and
definite
against
all
the
winter
sunsets
have
blurred
a
little
are
no
longer
altogether
in
focus
they
blur
more
and
more
as
the
days
go
by
i
ever
forget
it
cease
to
think
of
them
as
trees
and
only
know
that
over
and
beyond
you
there
is
a
faint
uncertain
mist
of
tenderest
green
faint
so
uncertain
that
you
almost
glance
up
to
see
whether
it
has
drifted
away
on
a
slow
pungent
gust
from
the
marshes
but
instead
of
doing
that
it
grows
denser
and
greener
against
the
blue
until
it
is
no
longer
a
mist
but
a
cloud
then
at
last
there
is
a
delicious
crinkling
and
the
leaves
have
come
in
may
and
june
bleak
shabby
cambridge
covers
all
its
angles
and
corners
they
are
softened
and
filled
with
billows
and
jets
and
sprays
and
garlands
gold
silver
mauve
is
the
color
of
apple
blossoms
they
are
such
a
tremor
of
white
and
pink
that
i
never
really
know
the
wind
loses
its
bite
and
then
its
chill
the
air
is
moist
and
warm
and
as
you
walk
slowly
through
the
quiet
leafy
streets
at
night
the
damp
fresh
lilacs
stretch
out
to
dabble
against
your
face
and
may
be
the
stillness
and
sweetness
of
it
all
or
it
may
be
just
the
penetrating
smell
of
the
box
makes
you
very
sad
and
very
happy
at
the
same
time
during
the
day
between
lectures
we
loafed
a
good
deal
brattle
street
chiefly
and
often
in
the
afternoon
when
we
were
beginning
to
think
of
thinking
of
grinding
for
the
finals
berri
and
i
and
occasionally
hemington
used
to
take
a
book
or
some
notes
and
go
up
to
the
vacant
lot
across
the
street
from
the
longfellow
house
at
the
further
end
of
this
open
meadow
during
the
poet
s
lifetime
but
now
unfortunately
a
rather
ugly
little
is
a
stone
terrace
with
a
short
flight
of
steps
and
two
broad
stone
seats
against
the
wall
below
passionate
pilgrims
come
there
for
a
moment
once
in
a
while
but
as
a
rule
it
is
deserted
we
pretended
to
study
here
but
dates
and
formulas
and
geschmitzenmenger
s
reflections
on
the
building
materials
of
ancient
rome
always
got
mixed
up
in
hemington
s
tobacco
smoke
or
we
forgot
about
them
in
watching
the
sun
sparkle
on
the
pools
left
by
the
falling
tide
berri
said
that
even
italy
had
very
little
more
to
offer
one
than
a
stone
bench
soaked
in
sunlight
and
the
delusion
that
one
was
accomplishing
something
now
and
then
we
strolled
in
longfellow
s
garden
the
family
were
out
of
town
and
berri
inherits
the
privilege
of
doing
this
from
his
aunt
i
can
t
get
away
from
the
idea
that
although
the
days
were
getting
longer
and
slower
as
class
day
drew
near
they
went
ever
so
much
more
quickly
than
they
had
at
first
notwithstanding
also
the
fact
that
i
got
up
earlier
i
happened
to
do
this
the
first
time
by
accident
bertie
stockbridge
was
the
only
person
at
breakfast
and
when
i
asked
him
not
to
leave
me
alone
he
said
he
had
to
or
he
would
be
late
for
chapel
i
had
n
t
known
before
that
he
went
to
chapel
but
he
told
me
he
never
missed
a
morning
i
had
n
t
been
there
myself
at
all
but
that
morning
i
went
with
him
it
was
very
nice
the
president
was
there
and
the
dean
and
several
of
the
professors
and
a
good
many
of
whom
i
would
n
t
have
suspected
of
even
knowing
where
the
chapel
was
the
music
was
fine
the
little
boys
in
the
choir
sang
like
angels
same
little
boys
who
used
to
paste
us
with
snowballs
during
the
winter
after
that
i
went
to
chapel
almost
every
morning
until
college
closed
it
was
a
good
way
to
begin
the
day
somehow
berri
began
to
go
too
after
a
while
but
he
said
he
did
it
to
give
him
luck
in
his
exams
on
saturday
afternoons
and
sundays
we
bicycled
a
great
deal
when
the
roads
began
to
get
into
shape
the
whole
table
would
start
off
and
explore
the
park
system
and
once
we
made
a
historical
tour
of
lexington
and
concord
which
berri
wrote
up
for
the
lampoon
i
think
berri
will
make
the
lampoon
next
year
if
he
keeps
on
his
way
of
going
about
it
is
killing
he
writes
things
and
then
comes
into
my
room
with
a
solemn
anxious
face
and
says
do
you
think
this
is
funny
glance
through
it
carelessly
and
tell
me
just
how
it
strikes
you
i
think
it
s
perfectly
myself
do
really
but
it
mightn
t
strike
anybody
else
that
way
then
there
was
riverside
where
the
charles
all
but
loses
itself
between
steep
cool
shady
banks
under
trees
that
peer
over
the
edges
all
through
the
long
drowsy
summer
or
flows
brimming
across
a
meadow
where
a
man
ploughs
a
rich
black
border
and
talks
to
his
horses
and
sings
it
takes
just
the
amount
of
effort
you
like
to
make
to
follow
in
a
canoe
the
course
of
this
lazy
stream
riverside
is
another
place
to
which
you
like
to
take
all
the
essentials
for
study
except
the
power
of
will
as
the
board
decided
to
let
me
off
probation
late
in
the
spring
i
could
cut
lectures
once
more
without
anything
very
terrible
happening
and
it
was
great
on
a
warm
morning
to
walk
into
town
for
luncheon
and
keep
our
hats
off
while
we
were
on
the
bridge
there
s
almost
always
a
on
the
bridge
i
hardly
know
how
to
write
of
the
surprising
and
wonderful
thing
that
happened
to
me
at
the
end
of
may
it
came
so
unexpectedly
that
even
now
i
sometimes
stop
to
wonder
if
it
ever
happened
at
all
and
if
i
can
be
really
i
but
when
i
think
it
all
over
carefully
remembering
a
few
of
the
situations
that
led
up
to
it
incidents
that
were
inexplicable
at
the
time
and
worried
me
very
much
see
now
that
i
wasn
t
very
intelligent
in
not
suspecting
a
little
what
they
meant
i
never
did
though
not
in
the
least
the
thing
that
little
the
simple
statement
would
mean
to
papa
for
instance
and
how
much
it
really
does
mean
thing
that
happened
was
that
i
made
the
first
ten
of
the
dickey
as
long
ago
as
april
the
first
ten
began
to
it
began
to
be
very
much
on
people
s
minds
although
of
course
hardly
anything
was
said
about
it
berri
and
i
used
to
talk
about
it
a
little
hemington
and
i
mentioned
it
once
in
a
while
i
suppose
there
are
about
four
men
in
our
class
that
i
knew
well
enough
to
discuss
it
with
but
naturally
we
spoke
of
it
only
when
we
were
absolutely
alone
if
any
one
else
came
into
the
room
we
began
to
talk
about
something
else
yet
although
the
subject
could
n
t
come
up
in
general
conversation
i
often
knew
that
it
was
everybody
s
the
atmosphere
every
day
some
little
thing
would
happen
that
almost
made
you
jump
as
it
suddenly
brought
the
question
into
your
mind
who
is
going
to
make
the
first
ten
things
for
instance
like
seeing
some
one
in
our
class
walking
through
the
square
with
a
dickey
man
who
was
in
the
sophomore
class
that
always
looked
as
if
it
meant
something
because
it
very
often
mean
something
one
night
berri
told
me
in
the
strictest
confidence
of
course
that
phil
upper
met
a
girl
cousin
of
his
in
town
at
a
tea
and
had
said
to
her
that
he
liked
berri
and
thought
he
was
great
fun
to
talk
to
she
had
told
this
to
berri
s
aunt
who
had
repeated
the
remark
to
berri
who
was
in
a
great
state
about
it
and
wondered
how
much
importance
he
ought
to
attach
to
it
it
really
did
sound
to
me
as
if
something
might
come
of
it
we
made
lists
of
names
and
bet
on
them
and
then
locked
them
up
in
our
desks
i
put
berri
s
name
on
my
list
but
whether
or
not
he
put
mine
on
his
i
don
t
know
for
after
the
crash
came
we
forgot
to
compare
notes
as
the
time
grew
near
not
only
berri
but
a
good
many
fellows
i
knew
well
began
to
treat
me
in
a
way
i
did
n
t
understand
and
did
n
t
like
i
don
t
know
just
how
to
describe
the
gradual
change
in
their
manner
toward
me
because
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
you
feel
without
being
able
to
put
your
finger
on
the
cause
or
even
on
the
change
itself
without
seeming
morbid
and
exaggerated
but
i
could
n
t
help
realizing
that
they
treated
me
rather
coolly
they
stopped
coming
to
my
room
as
often
as
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
they
left
me
out
of
all
sorts
of
little
things
i
had
always
been
in
before
as
a
matter
of
course
and
more
than
once
as
i
took
my
seat
at
the
table
or
went
into
somebody
s
room
i
could
see
that
my
appearance
made
the
fellows
uncomfortable
for
a
moment
or
at
least
gave
the
talk
a
different
turn
all
this
hurt
my
feelings
terribly
and
i
tried
to
think
what
i
could
have
done
to
make
the
fellows
i
liked
best
and
considered
my
friends
treat
me
this
way
but
i
could
n
t
think
of
a
thing
i
supposed
i
must
have
done
something
without
appreciating
what
the
consequences
would
be
it
made
me
feel
pretty
badly
i
can
tell
you
and
several
times
i
was
on
the
point
of
demanding
an
explanation
but
they
were
all
so
polite
and
distant
and
reserved
that
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
of
course
now
i
understand
exactly
why
it
was
and
see
how
hopelessly
stupid
i
must
have
been
not
to
have
suspected
anything
the
whole
situation
arose
from
the
fact
that
there
was
a
rumor
in
the
class
to
the
effect
that
i
was
being
considered
for
the
first
ten
rumor
that
was
apparently
given
foundation
by
my
being
seen
several
times
with
dick
smith
this
made
the
fellows
instinctively
avoid
me
a
little
from
a
feeling
that
i
and
the
class
generally
might
imagine
that
they
were
trying
to
swipe
if
they
went
around
much
with
me
it
seems
to
me
now
particularly
dense
on
my
part
not
to
have
had
a
glimmer
of
this
because
it
was
just
the
way
i
felt
myself
toward
tucker
ludlow
who
had
gone
to
the
theatre
one
night
with
phil
blackwood
and
two
or
three
other
men
who
were
spoken
of
for
the
first
ten
yet
i
never
dreamed
that
any
one
could
look
at
me
in
this
way
well
things
went
on
getting
more
whispery
and
panicky
and
uncomfortable
until
finally
one
night
at
the
end
of
last
month
the
crash
came
just
how
anybody
really
knew
that
the
dickey
was
having
its
great
spring
meeting
for
the
purpose
of
electing
the
first
ten
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
for
i
can
t
believe
that
it
was
breathed
in
so
many
words
but
we
did
know
it
and
we
knew
that
it
lasted
for
three
days
and
three
nights
before
the
decision
was
reached
in
the
afternoon
dick
smith
overtook
me
in
the
street
and
after
walking
along
for
half
a
block
said
abruptly
by
the
way
wood
stay
in
your
room
and
then
disappeared
in
a
doorway
i
think
my
heart
stopped
beating
i
did
n
t
dare
let
myself
dwell
on
the
meaning
of
his
words
but
stumbled
to
my
lecture
and
sat
there
simply
dazed
at
the
end
of
the
hour
i
ran
back
to
my
room
when
i
heard
berri
come
in
i
grabbed
a
book
and
stared
at
it
blindly
without
seeing
a
word
but
berri
passed
along
the
hall
to
his
own
study
without
so
much
as
stopping
at
my
open
door
i
did
n
t
go
to
our
table
for
luncheon
i
slipped
into
the
holly
tree
later
instead
but
i
could
n
t
eat
anything
i
was
so
excited
and
nervous
and
full
of
doubt
and
fright
that
i
don
t
remember
just
how
i
got
through
the
afternoon
i
know
i
tried
to
sit
in
my
room
but
gave
it
up
and
buried
myself
for
a
while
in
one
of
the
alcoves
of
the
library
later
i
walked
in
back
streets
and
then
ran
all
the
way
home
when
the
light
began
to
fade
fearing
that
could
n
t
bring
myself
to
think
just
happen
in
my
absence
by
that
time
i
was
painfully
hungry
and
managed
to
swallow
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
of
toast
at
the
holly
tree
the
evening
was
endless
i
tried
to
read
but
by
the
time
i
reached
the
end
of
a
sentence
i
had
forgotten
the
beginning
of
it
then
i
tried
to
write
a
letter
to
mamma
but
my
hand
trembled
so
that
the
writing
scarcely
looked
like
mine
at
all
and
anyhow
i
couldn
t
think
of
enough
to
fill
the
first
page
it
was
as
if
i
were
two
distinct
persons
trying
to
write
a
calm
letter
to
mamma
and
the
other
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
and
uncertainty
i
don
t
know
which
was
worse
feeling
that
the
dickey
was
coming
for
me
or
the
feeling
that
perhaps
it
wasn
t
could
dick
smith
have
merely
meant
that
he
might
drop
in
to
see
me
that
evening
he
had
never
been
in
my
room
and
it
seemed
unlikely
that
he
should
come
in
that
way
his
manner
too
of
telling
me
to
stay
at
home
had
been
so
odd
his
so
abrupt
i
turned
these
things
over
in
my
mind
interminably
then
i
would
glance
at
the
clock
and
find
the
hands
glued
to
the
same
old
place
to
make
things
worse
berri
had
come
home
almost
as
soon
as
i
had
and
was
in
his
room
with
the
door
shut
i
longed
to
go
in
but
the
feeling
that
i
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
say
if
i
did
kept
me
back
he
made
me
even
more
nervous
than
i
really
was
by
walking
up
and
down
up
and
down
and
occasionally
moving
a
chair
as
if
he
had
run
into
it
in
his
restless
promenade
and
were
pushing
it
viciously
out
of
the
way
if
his
manner
hadn
t
been
so
strained
and
queer
i
think
i
should
have
gone
in
anyhow
and
relieved
my
mind
i
did
n
t
intend
to
do
quite
this
but
at
the
end
of
about
two
hours
i
could
n
t
endure
the
lonely
suspense
any
longer
and
decided
at
least
to
knock
on
his
door
and
borrow
did
n
t
know
what
when
i
started
chester
had
forgotten
to
light
the
lamp
in
the
hall
and
as
i
was
feeling
my
way
through
the
darkness
and
deciding
that
a
match
would
be
the
most
plausible
excuse
for
going
in
and
then
going
out
again
almost
immediately
i
bumped
into
somebody
coming
the
other
way
we
both
jumped
back
and
i
thought
for
a
second
that
i
was
about
to
collapse
at
the
knees
oh
it
s
you
berri
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
i
just
recognized
as
his
heavens
but
you
scared
me
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
room
to
borrow
oh
granny
he
broke
off
with
a
kind
of
gulp
and
threw
his
arms
around
me
isn
t
this
ghastly
then
i
knew
that
he
had
been
told
to
stay
in
his
room
too
and
had
been
suffering
the
same
horrors
ever
since
dinner
he
had
been
pacing
the
floor
unable
just
as
i
had
been
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
exact
significance
of
the
advice
to
be
at
home
that
evening
he
could
n
t
help
feeling
that
it
might
have
been
a
mistake
that
something
would
go
wrong
and
that
again
if
nothing
go
wrong
there
was
the
hideous
conjecture
as
to
what
would
happen
to
you
to
look
forward
to
we
sat
down
in
my
study
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
his
hands
folded
with
desperate
calmness
on
his
lap
i
at
my
desk
where
i
found
after
a
minute
or
two
of
strained
silence
that
i
had
dug
a
great
hole
in
my
blotter
and
ruined
a
stylographic
pen
if
they
do
come
berri
at
last
whispered
how
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
found
i
don
t
know
that
it
would
be
altogether
the
thing
to
be
dressed
and
apparently
waiting
our
extreme
preparedness
did
seem
rather
assuming
now
that
he
spoke
of
it
i
was
far
from
wanting
to
appear
of
my
election
or
of
anything
else
to
a
fiendish
mob
such
as
we
had
watched
from
my
window
that
night
in
the
autumn
and
yet
i
answered
if
we
took
off
very
much
i
don
t
suppose
they
would
wait
for
us
to
dress
in
fact
i
don
t
think
i
dress
and
when
i
came
in
it
seemed
to
be
getting
cool
ssssshh
i
thought
i
heard
something
berri
broke
in
he
leaned
toward
the
window
and
as
the
lamplight
fell
on
his
face
i
saw
for
the
first
time
how
pale
he
was
we
listened
the
clock
ticked
with
a
queer
little
hum
on
two
notes
that
i
had
never
known
it
to
make
before
the
grumbled
twice
and
each
time
the
flame
rose
and
fell
i
had
never
noticed
this
either
i
was
perfectly
sure
berri
whispered
his
whisper
was
several
times
louder
than
his
ordinary
tone
how
do
you
think
it
would
do
to
take
off
our
coats
and
neckties
i
suggested
that
would
look
as
if
we
had
begun
to
get
ready
for
bed
without
any
suspicion
and
at
the
same
time
we
would
have
pretty
much
everything
on
you
talk
now
as
if
you
had
made
up
your
mind
that
they
were
coming
berri
said
nervously
do
you
think
they
are
the
fact
of
his
asking
me
this
dropped
me
back
once
more
into
all
the
sickening
doubt
from
which
for
a
minute
or
two
i
had
been
unconsciously
lifted
i
don
t
know
i
faltered
what
do
you
think
but
instead
of
telling
me
berri
exclaimed
oh
this
is
awful
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
walked
he
took
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
in
a
corner
then
he
gave
the
end
of
his
necktie
a
jerk
that
not
only
undid
the
knot
but
ripped
his
shirt
open
from
his
neck
to
his
shoulders
for
he
had
forgotten
that
on
one
side
the
thing
was
pinned
i
don
t
think
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
as
he
went
on
pulling
and
pulling
until
he
had
torn
out
a
narrow
strip
of
linen
at
least
a
foot
and
a
half
long
berri
pacing
the
floor
and
tearing
himself
to
pieces
in
a
nervous
frenzy
as
he
paced
struck
me
all
at
once
as
the
funniest
thing
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
began
first
to
giggle
and
then
to
laugh
with
the
kind
of
laughter
that
takes
possession
of
you
all
over
and
leaves
you
helpless
i
was
leaning
back
in
my
chair
weak
and
hysterical
when
berri
stopped
as
abruptly
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
stood
petrified
in
the
middle
of
the
room
away
in
the
distance
the
chanting
cry
of
the
dickey
had
begun
to
rise
and
fall
die
with
a
tenor
wail
and
begin
again
my
laughter
died
with
it
and
as
i
lay
there
hypnotized
by
the
sound
i
think
i
must
have
forgotten
to
close
my
mouth
for
when
berri
spoke
again
my
throat
was
parched
and
rough
perhaps
he
did
n
t
think
he
just
made
a
feeble
motion
with
his
hand
that
i
interpreted
as
a
sign
to
take
off
my
coat
and
necktie
but
i
couldn
t
act
on
it
i
could
n
t
do
anything
but
lean
back
with
my
eyes
fixed
and
listen
to
the
approaching
song
it
grew
louder
and
louder
clearer
and
clearer
fiercer
and
fiercer
until
it
broke
all
at
once
into
a
great
roar
and
i
knew
that
they
had
turned
the
corner
and
were
coming
down
our
little
street
then
i
felt
berri
s
hand
in
mine
was
cold
and
wet
he
was
saying
incoherently
good
by
mustn
t
be
found
in
your
must
be
found
in
my
own
a
a
then
the
exultant
song
and
the
heavy
rhythm
of
feet
under
my
window
suddenly
stopped
there
was
a
moment
almost
of
silence
followed
by
a
hoarse
yell
from
what
seemed
like
a
thousand
savage
throats
in
the
pandemonium
my
ears
distinguished
here
and
there
the
sound
of
my
own
name
shouted
and
shrieked
in
various
tones
of
impatient
unbridled
vindictive
eagerness
and
for
a
second
my
thoughts
flashed
back
to
the
night
berri
and
i
had
seen
some
one
else
pulled
out
that
had
thrilled
me
but
this
reduced
me
to
a
quaking
pulp
the
door
downstairs
crashed
was
a
deafening
scramble
on
the
tin
own
door
burst
room
was
full
of
greedy
hands
and
vengeful
faces
i
was
through
the
air
out
into
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
in
two
the
piazza
down
the
steps
along
the
walk
out
of
the
gate
between
a
double
line
of
executioners
into
the
hungry
mob
that
dragged
me
this
way
and
that
tore
at
my
hair
and
clothes
rolled
me
in
the
dirt
and
finally
jerked
me
upright
linked
my
arms
in
those
of
some
other
neophytes
i
could
n
t
see
who
they
were
and
started
me
down
the
street
with
a
kick
we
swayed
million
devils
behind
the
dickey
song
as
we
had
been
commanded
to
at
the
top
of
our
lungs
for
obvious
reasons
certain
parts
of
granny
wood
s
diary
have
not
been
printed
of
the
passages
that
refer
to
the
dickey
only
those
describing
the
society
s
public
practices
have
been
editor
most
of
the
time
i
was
on
my
knees
there
were
only
two
moments
of
relief
in
the
painful
march
they
came
when
the
crowd
stopped
to
pull
out
two
other
unfortunates
and
hurl
them
as
i
had
been
hurled
from
their
respective
front
doors
for
the
time
being
it
was
a
very
short
time
however
the
rest
of
us
were
neglected
but
as
soon
as
the
arms
of
our
fellow
neophyte
were
linked
in
ours
the
irresistible
impetus
from
behind
began
once
more
and
we
continued
our
perilous
way
at
last
all
ten
of
us
were
dazed
and
gasping
the
steps
of
claverly
hall
and
our
names
were
cheered
in
the
order
of
our
election
with
the
exception
of
berri
i
had
n
t
known
before
who
the
others
were
in
the
darkness
and
excitement
it
had
been
impossible
to
see
there
was
something
ominous
and
depressing
in
the
cheers
they
gave
us
berri
said
in
talking
about
it
the
week
afterward
that
it
was
as
if
the
cannibal
band
should
cheer
the
missionary
then
the
crowd
melted
away
with
vague
threats
as
to
what
was
to
come
and
i
was
taken
back
to
my
room
weary
and
stupid
by
dick
smith
he
was
to
be
my
guide
and
only
friend
during
the
week
that
was
to
follow
before
he
left
me
he
told
me
the
conditions
of
my
servitude
that
week
was
the
longest
and
most
absolutely
wretched
of
my
life
i
think
although
now
that
it
is
over
i
would
n
t
give
up
the
memory
of
it
for
almost
anything
even
in
the
midst
of
it
the
idea
of
chucking
the
whole
thing
as
i
suppose
i
might
have
done
never
occurred
to
me
i
could
at
times
conceive
of
my
giving
out
but
never
of
my
giving
up
the
first
day
of
my
running
as
it
is
called
from
six
in
the
morning
until
ten
o
clock
at
night
was
one
long
embarrassment
mortification
and
mental
agony
to
me
i
set
my
teeth
and
forced
myself
through
it
doggedly
the
days
that
followed
were
just
as
bad
worse
perhaps
i
did
n
t
have
to
compel
myself
to
do
things
i
went
through
them
mechanically
where
almost
everything
was
a
hideous
nightmare
no
one
incident
after
a
time
had
the
power
to
overwhelm
me
as
at
first
i
was
too
tired
and
dirty
and
unshaven
and
cowed
to
care
particularly
what
they
made
me
do
or
to
have
a
feeling
of
any
kind
other
than
one
of
hopeless
submission
in
the
morning
after
an
early
breakfast
at
the
holly
tree
then
some
one
usually
three
or
four
would
get
hold
of
me
and
make
me
do
perfectly
awful
things
in
the
college
yard
or
on
the
streets
i
had
to
perform
so
many
crazy
acts
that
i
can
t
remember
them
all
or
on
what
days
they
came
and
as
i
said
i
grew
perfectly
indifferent
to
what
i
had
to
do
or
who
saw
me
do
it
one
warm
afternoon
they
made
me
put
on
three
soft
thick
sweaters
and
then
took
me
to
a
in
the
square
where
they
poured
over
me
half
the
contents
of
a
long
line
of
perfumery
bottles
on
the
counter
heliotrope
patchouly
musk
ylangylang
violet
and
several
kinds
of
cologne
the
deadly
scents
that
one
investigates
while
waiting
for
a
prescription
to
be
put
up
then
we
got
on
an
electric
car
fellows
who
were
running
me
at
one
end
and
i
at
the
other
they
of
course
after
instructing
me
to
snuggle
up
to
my
fellow
passengers
old
ladies
and
peevish
gentlemen
in
particular
pretended
to
ignore
me
but
the
other
passengers
did
n
t
everybody
i
sat
next
to
would
turn
after
about
three
seconds
look
at
me
with
a
slight
contraction
of
the
nostrils
and
then
move
away
in
less
than
ten
seconds
more
they
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
one
side
of
the
car
all
to
myself
also
i
had
been
ordered
to
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
bridge
i
jumped
up
and
as
a
sort
of
climax
threw
a
fit
passengers
in
street
cars
always
find
this
very
trying
especially
if
you
fall
down
in
the
aisle
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
clutch
at
their
feet
before
my
five
days
of
running
were
over
i
grew
exceedingly
expert
at
throwing
fits
i
certainly
had
enough
practice
at
it
well
when
we
got
across
the
bridge
i
was
hustled
out
of
the
car
into
a
where
i
recovered
in
time
to
catch
the
next
car
do
the
whole
thing
over
again
it
was
on
the
evening
of
that
day
i
think
that
they
took
me
to
the
i
should
say
the
theatres
as
we
visited
several
they
had
in
the
mean
time
taken
off
the
garments
not
through
consideration
for
my
feelings
but
for
their
own
one
might
think
that
under
the
circumstances
going
to
the
theatre
would
have
been
a
delightful
rest
but
it
wasn
t
i
had
a
seat
all
to
myself
down
in
front
and
the
fellows
who
took
me
sat
ten
or
twelve
rows
back
beyond
the
fact
that
the
first
play
we
went
to
was
a
nice
staid
performance
that
had
attracted
a
large
and
very
dressy
audience
i
have
no
recollection
of
it
for
my
thoughts
were
all
centred
on
the
dreadful
thing
that
was
going
to
happen
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
the
curtain
went
down
there
was
a
polite
flutter
of
applause
and
then
while
the
orchestra
was
getting
ready
and
the
house
was
perfectly
quiet
except
for
a
murmur
of
talk
i
stood
up
facing
everybody
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
distinct
voice
this
show
is
bum
and
i
want
my
money
back
the
effect
was
electrical
all
conversation
stopped
instantly
and
i
could
actually
hear
the
craning
of
necks
from
one
end
of
the
theatre
to
the
other
this
show
is
bum
and
i
want
my
money
back
i
declared
again
louder
than
before
some
men
near
me
began
to
laugh
the
ladies
looked
scared
to
death
and
from
the
gallery
came
a
wild
clapping
of
hands
and
yells
of
that
s
no
lie
and
he
s
all
right
whereupon
as
per
instructions
i
began
to
yell
the
thing
over
and
over
again
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
kept
it
up
until
four
ushers
skated
down
the
aisle
and
threw
me
out
still
yelling
i
had
visions
as
i
flew
along
toward
the
exit
of
women
indulging
in
hysterics
i
did
this
at
two
other
shows
and
the
fellows
regretted
very
much
that
there
didn
t
happen
to
be
any
plays
in
town
for
they
said
my
technique
got
better
and
better
as
the
evening
went
on
then
i
spent
whole
afternoons
in
creeping
up
behind
the
sparrows
in
the
square
and
endeavoring
to
put
salt
on
their
tails
in
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
the
clerks
to
change
a
cent
in
holding
up
baby
carriages
kissing
the
occupants
and
then
remarking
that
i
was
passionately
fond
of
animals
i
kissed
babies
on
commonwealth
avenue
in
one
afternoon
i
stalked
indians
with
a
little
bow
and
arrow
in
the
yard
one
morning
between
lectures
cutting
lectures
is
n
t
allowed
craftily
creeping
from
tree
to
tree
hiding
a
moment
peeping
out
warily
and
finally
exclaiming
as
i
shot
an
arrow
and
dashed
into
the
open
another
bit
the
dust
this
was
one
of
the
few
times
except
in
the
evening
that
i
saw
berri
during
the
entire
week
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
stone
parapet
of
matthews
with
a
silly
little
false
red
fringe
of
beard
around
his
neck
proclaiming
to
all
the
listen
to
me
i
am
a
berrisford
of
salem
in
a
pair
of
green
tights
and
on
horseback
i
distributed
armfuls
of
the
smuggled
cigars
from
santa
bawthawthawthoth
to
the
inhabitants
of
cambridgeport
and
when
a
great
crowd
had
collected
around
me
delivered
a
lecture
on
the
evils
of
smoking
i
intercepted
at
various
times
many
respectable
old
ladies
on
their
way
across
the
streets
for
the
purpose
of
confidentially
whispering
madam
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
you
are
holding
your
skirts
just
a
leetle
too
high
i
also
had
to
stop
car
after
car
put
my
foot
on
the
step
tie
my
shoestring
and
then
stand
back
saying
to
the
conductor
thank
you
you
may
go
on
now
this
is
an
old
game
but
it
s
a
great
favorite
two
things
happened
and
only
two
that
i
liked
one
was
when
i
had
to
call
on
a
girl
in
had
never
seen
her
write
all
my
part
of
the
conversation
on
a
slate
she
was
very
pretty
and
good
to
me
for
instead
of
being
disgusted
at
my
appearance
she
had
every
reason
to
be
and
having
me
put
out
of
the
house
she
made
me
sit
down
and
ordered
tea
i
realized
for
the
first
time
how
nice
tea
could
be
and
was
altogether
a
perfect
peach
she
said
among
other
things
that
she
had
been
at
the
theatre
the
night
i
made
the
row
i
wrote
on
the
slate
which
one
the
performance
was
given
by
special
request
at
three
different
places
which
made
her
laugh
i
stayed
talking
or
rather
writing
to
her
for
more
than
half
an
hour
the
fellows
who
had
brought
me
to
the
door
were
very
angry
for
thinking
that
i
would
be
chased
away
by
a
husky
footman
at
the
end
of
a
minute
or
two
they
had
n
t
told
me
how
long
to
stay
and
were
waiting
outside
to
see
what
happened
when
at
last
i
got
up
to
go
the
pretty
girl
held
out
her
hand
very
graciously
and
said
we
ll
meet
again
someday
i
m
sure
and
i
wrote
on
the
slate
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
we
don
t
she
took
the
slate
and
the
pencil
drew
a
line
through
the
last
word
and
wrote
under
it
au
revoir
then
i
left
i
meet
her
again
very
soon
afterwards
at
the
beck
spread
on
class
day
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
there
she
s
going
abroad
in
three
days
and
as
papa
let
me
engage
passage
for
our
trip
he
and
mamma
and
mildred
will
be
here
to
morrow
it
did
n
t
take
me
long
to
decide
on
the
steamer
when
he
found
that
i
had
picked
out
for
no
apparent
reason
one
of
the
old
cunarders
sailing
from
boston
he
was
perfectly
furious
but
it
s
too
late
for
him
to
change
now
the
other
thing
i
enjoyed
during
my
running
was
the
day
that
fleetwood
stole
me
away
from
some
fellows
and
took
me
up
to
his
room
overlooking
the
yard
he
is
an
old
dickey
man
himself
and
had
as
much
right
to
my
services
as
any
one
i
embarrassed
him
at
first
i
think
strangely
enough
i
appreciated
this
a
little
even
then
when
i
had
no
business
to
be
appreciating
anything
beyond
the
fact
that
i
was
a
mere
grovelling
worm
he
sat
down
when
we
went
into
his
room
and
looked
at
me
curiously
diffidently
for
a
moment
as
if
he
did
n
t
quite
know
how
to
begin
then
he
said
with
something
of
an
effort
as
if
he
considered
himself
a
little
foolish
to
say
anything
what
pray
is
your
name
i
gave
the
required
answer
at
which
he
sadly
i
thought
although
i
did
n
t
see
what
reason
had
to
look
that
way
then
he
asked
me
to
do
several
things
old
things
that
neophytes
probably
had
to
do
when
the
dickey
was
first
started
things
that
have
become
conventions
the
kind
of
things
you
are
always
asked
to
do
by
fellows
who
have
n
t
enough
imagination
to
think
of
anything
new
he
gave
his
commands
with
him
however
they
became
requests
slowly
as
if
he
couldn
t
remember
just
how
they
went
and
he
didn
t
always
express
them
the
way
the
fellows
do
i
could
n
t
help
feeling
that
if
shakespeare
had
ever
tried
to
torment
a
neophyte
he
had
done
it
in
very
much
the
same
way
he
scarcely
noticed
my
attempts
to
do
what
he
asked
he
was
interested
i
think
not
so
much
in
discovering
my
feeble
talents
as
in
recalling
the
general
situation
but
he
stopped
doing
even
this
in
a
short
time
and
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
into
the
wilderness
of
elm
leaves
and
down
at
the
cool
shady
stretches
of
grass
and
the
yellow
paths
of
the
yard
i
really
think
he
forgot
all
about
me
for
i
stood
there
an
interminable
time
waiting
for
him
to
turn
around
just
before
he
did
turn
he
yawned
and
said
listlessly
to
himself
well
i
suppose
it
s
as
it
should
be
he
must
have
said
this
to
himself
as
he
seemed
surprised
to
find
me
standing
patiently
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
he
had
left
me
my
dear
boy
sit
down
sit
down
he
exclaimed
that
is
unless
you
would
rather
go
away
i
answered
that
i
should
rather
stay
there
if
he
did
n
t
mind
it
was
so
cool
and
quiet
and
safe
in
his
room
i
knew
that
no
one
could
ever
find
me
and
i
was
very
tired
i
have
some
themes
to
read
fleetwood
went
on
but
you
won
t
disturb
me
do
whatever
you
want
to
and
if
you
feel
like
it
talk
we
did
talk
a
little
then
i
stretched
out
on
his
divan
and
tried
to
read
but
before
i
had
finished
half
a
chapter
i
drifted
away
into
the
most
blissful
sleep
i
ve
ever
had
i
can
just
remember
the
whispering
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
pavement
under
the
windows
and
the
rustle
of
the
crisp
new
leaves
when
i
awoke
the
room
was
dark
there
was
a
sheet
of
paper
pinned
to
my
coat
and
when
i
got
into
the
lighted
corridor
i
saw
written
on
it
in
reply
to
any
questions
as
to
your
disappearance
you
may
truthfully
explain
that
you
did
a
difficult
and
important
bit
of
work
for
j
fleetwood
i
don
t
know
yet
what
he
meant
some
day
next
year
i
think
i
ll
ask
him
i
don
t
believe
i
know
any
one
who
is
so
very
clever
and
so
very
kind
the
next
night
of
the
it
was
only
natural
i
suppose
that
for
a
week
or
so
after
we
had
become
dickey
men
the
first
ten
should
have
stuck
pretty
close
together
we
had
such
a
lot
to
talk
about
that
we
could
n
t
very
well
talk
about
to
outsiders
to
tell
the
truth
the
rest
of
the
class
for
a
time
seemed
like
outsiders
to
me
they
had
n
t
been
through
what
we
had
and
i
confess
that
i
could
n
t
help
looking
on
our
little
crowd
as
something
apart
from
the
others
and
taken
all
in
all
rather
extraordinary
i
don
t
know
that
i
thought
this
in
so
many
words
but
i
did
feel
it
and
it
was
all
brought
me
back
to
earth
one
day
with
a
jerk
i
forget
just
what
i
said
to
call
forth
his
remarks
but
it
was
something
in
the
nature
of
a
complaint
that
the
fellows
at
the
table
did
n
t
seem
to
have
as
much
time
for
me
so
to
speak
as
they
once
had
berri
puffed
at
his
pipe
for
a
while
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
and
finally
said
of
course
i
see
what
you
mean
but
it
s
not
them
you
s
us
i
m
sure
i
don
t
i
began
defensively
no
i
don
t
believe
you
do
realize
the
true
state
of
affairs
berri
interrupted
lots
of
fellows
would
and
then
pretend
all
the
time
that
they
did
n
t
that
s
what
i
do
but
you
don
t
you
just
have
the
from
pure
delight
and
go
around
swelled
up
like
a
without
in
the
least
knowing
it
your
old
friends
know
it
though
and
it
naturally
makes
them
a
dash
tired
and
besides
what
do
you
expect
them
to
do
anyhow
run
after
us
of
course
they
won
t
do
that
in
the
first
place
we
ve
both
become
rather
obnoxious
i
don
t
mind
it
in
myself
but
with
you
it
s
scarcely
in
character
and
in
the
second
place
none
of
the
fellows
at
our
table
are
swipes
and
if
any
advances
are
made
well
they
won
t
make
them
so
there
you
are
there
was
nothing
much
to
say
to
this
because
after
a
few
minutes
of
resentment
i
felt
all
over
that
it
was
perfectly
true
i
did
n
t
say
anything
but
you
bet
it
was
n
t
more
than
a
day
or
two
before
the
fellows
seemed
to
me
just
the
way
they
always
had
seemed
i
think
i
had
a
pretty
close
call
i
might
have
turned
into
a
dick
benton
three
days
before
class
day
who
should
blow
in
but
duggie
he
literally
did
blow
in
come
to
think
of
it
as
he
crossed
from
cadiz
in
a
and
was
as
brown
as
a
spaniard
he
brought
chester
a
black
lace
shawl
and
told
her
that
if
she
d
drape
it
around
her
head
and
sit
at
her
upstairs
window
some
evening
he
d
come
and
serenade
her
to
which
the
old
girl
responded
with
one
of
her
roguish
little
digs
at
duggie
s
ribs
and
exclaimed
land
sakes
duggie
you
can
t
sing
and
never
could
duggie
wanted
berri
and
me
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
but
berri
s
last
examination
was
to
come
the
next
morning
i
had
finished
all
of
mine
and
he
could
n
t
i
did
though
and
we
walked
out
to
cambridge
afterwards
in
the
moonlight
he
told
me
all
about
his
trip
and
when
i
let
him
know
that
we
were
going
abroad
for
the
summer
and
that
berri
was
going
over
with
us
to
join
his
mother
at
dinard
he
said
i
had
a
letter
from
berri
in
answer
to
mine
i
don
t
often
keep
letters
but
i
ve
kept
his
i
suppose
you
know
i
did
n
t
think
much
of
berri
at
first
but
i
don
t
mind
confessing
that
i
sized
him
up
all
wrong
it
was
such
a
beautiful
night
that
when
we
got
to
our
gate
it
seemed
like
wasting
something
to
go
in
the
house
berri
had
finished
his
grind
and
was
leaning
out
of
my
window
he
said
that
his
brain
felt
like
a
dead
jellyfish
i
think
that
was
the
pretty
simile
and
told
us
not
to
go
in
as
he
would
put
on
his
coat
and
come
down
to
us
so
we
strolled
all
three
over
to
the
yard
and
sat
on
the
steps
in
front
of
one
of
the
holworthy
entries
it
was
very
late
but
the
finals
were
not
yet
over
and
the
yellow
of
many
windows
blurred
through
the
trees
the
long
quadrangle
was
flecked
with
moonlight
and
little
groups
like
our
own
were
sitting
in
front
of
almost
every
doorway
the
yard
except
on
great
occasions
is
rarely
noisy
and
that
night
it
seemed
particularly
quiet
kind
of
lull
before
the
crash
of
class
day
and
commencement
duggie
and
berri
and
i
sat
there
talking
until
the
air
and
the
sky
had
changed
from
summer
night
to
summer
morning
even
then
a
few
of
the
windows
were
still
glowing
the
end
