chapter
i
a
new
winnebago
sahwah
the
sunfish
sat
on
top
of
the
diving
tower
squinting
through
nakwisi
at
the
distant
horizon
sister
anne
sister
anne
called
migwan
from
the
rocks
below
do
you
see
any
one
coming
sahwah
lowered
her
glass
and
shook
her
head
no
sign
of
the
yet
she
answered
if
gladys
does
come
pretty
soon
i
shall
die
of
impatience
oh
what
do
you
suppose
be
like
anyway
beautiful
beyond
compare
answered
migwan
promptly
and
skilled
in
every
art
we
ever
thought
or
dreamed
of
she
is
going
to
be
my
affinity
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
sahwah
looked
rather
pensive
nobody
in
her
right
mind
would
choose
me
for
an
affinity
she
said
with
a
sigh
squinting
sidewise
down
her
nose
and
mentally
counting
the
freckles
thereon
i
not
interesting
enough
looking
goosie
said
migwan
laughing
affinities
are
chosen
they
just
happen
you
see
somebody
for
the
first
time
and
you
know
a
thing
about
her
perhaps
not
even
her
name
and
yet
something
tells
you
that
you
two
belong
together
that
an
affinity
but
how
can
you
tell
in
advance
that
you
and
gladys
are
going
to
be
affinities
asked
sahwah
how
do
you
know
that
when
she
sees
me
waving
the
sheet
from
the
tower
she
wo
say
to
herself
energetic
maiden
on
yon
lofty
tower
is
my
one
and
only
love
i
can
only
see
one
bloomer
leg
and
a
hank
of
hair
but
that
is
enough
to
recognize
my
soul
mate
by
come
to
my
arms
finny
migwan
laughed
at
the
picture
and
replied
mysteriously
oh
i
have
a
way
of
telling
things
beforehand
i
can
read
them
in
the
stars
sahwah
sniffed
and
resumed
her
watch
holding
the
sheet
in
readiness
to
wave
the
instant
the
little
steamer
should
appear
around
blueberry
island
the
minutes
passed
without
a
sign
of
the
and
sahwah
grew
tired
of
looking
at
nothing
she
ceased
staring
fixedly
at
the
distant
gap
between
blueberry
island
and
the
mainland
and
pointed
the
glass
around
at
the
objects
near
her
at
migwan
washing
middies
in
the
lake
her
soap
tied
to
the
dock
to
keep
it
from
floating
away
at
the
toothbrushes
strewn
over
the
rocks
like
bones
bleaching
in
the
sun
at
the
smooth
strip
of
shining
sand
aiming
her
glass
idly
now
here
now
there
her
feet
swinging
in
the
air
eighteen
feet
above
the
water
her
long
brown
hair
flying
in
the
wind
high
up
on
the
cliff
hinpoha
stood
nailing
the
railing
around
the
crow
nest
a
tiny
just
big
enough
for
two
built
in
the
branches
of
a
tall
pine
tree
she
finished
her
pounding
and
stood
looking
out
over
the
gleaming
lake
dotted
with
rocky
islands
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
her
gaze
strayed
again
and
again
to
the
narrow
gap
between
blueberry
island
and
the
mainland
and
now
and
then
she
heaved
an
impatient
sigh
oh
please
dear
she
said
aloud
please
hurry
up
by
and
by
her
eyes
rested
upon
sahwah
silhouetted
against
the
sky
on
top
of
the
diving
tower
picking
up
a
big
dry
pine
cone
from
the
floor
of
the
crow
nest
she
took
careful
aim
and
sent
it
sailing
downward
in
a
swift
curving
flight
the
prickly
missile
hit
sahwah
squarely
in
the
back
of
the
neck
she
started
violently
and
threw
up
her
arms
while
the
spyglass
fell
into
the
water
with
a
loud
splash
hinpoha
laughed
a
ringing
laugh
when
she
beheld
the
effect
of
her
handiwork
sahwah
turned
around
and
saw
hinpoha
perched
in
the
crow
nest
nearly
doubled
up
with
laughter
and
she
too
laughed
and
then
shaking
her
fist
amiably
in
hinpoha
direction
she
prepared
to
dive
from
the
tower
bloomers
and
all
in
search
of
the
as
she
stood
there
poised
on
the
end
of
the
springboard
her
ears
caught
the
sound
of
a
swinging
boating
song
borne
on
the
breeze
across
the
water
across
the
silver
lake
the
moonlit
ripples
break
their
path
a
magic
highway
seems
we
send
our
good
canoe
along
that
highway
too
and
follow
where
the
moonlight
gleams
around
the
cliff
which
jutted
out
just
beyond
the
camp
there
appeared
two
canoes
containing
four
more
of
the
winnebagos
making
all
speed
ahead
the
girls
singing
in
time
to
the
dipping
of
their
paddles
sahwah
curved
her
hands
around
her
mouth
and
set
forth
a
long
yodling
hail
which
was
answered
in
kind
by
the
paddlers
then
the
four
girls
in
the
boats
speaking
all
together
as
with
one
voice
called
to
sahwah
sahwah
waved
her
arm
as
a
signal
that
she
understood
and
then
stood
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
shadow
of
the
springboard
on
the
water
watching
to
see
which
canoe
would
cross
it
first
in
a
few
moments
the
slender
green
craft
bearing
nyoda
and
medmangi
shot
into
view
beneath
her
the
two
paddlers
shouting
triumphantly
scarcely
a
behind
came
the
other
pair
choosing
the
instant
when
the
second
canoe
was
directly
beneath
her
sahwah
jumped
from
the
springboard
and
landed
neatly
in
the
bow
upsetting
the
craft
and
dumping
the
girls
into
the
lake
the
other
girls
in
the
first
canoe
just
ahead
turned
to
see
what
was
happening
and
in
their
laughter
over
the
upset
forgot
to
hold
their
own
boat
steady
and
presently
there
was
a
second
spill
sahwah
came
up
choking
with
laughter
and
was
immediately
ducked
under
again
by
nakwisi
and
chapa
the
two
she
had
dropped
in
upon
the
water
flew
in
all
directions
and
migwan
fled
over
the
rocks
to
avoid
being
drenched
medmangi
and
nyoda
also
came
up
thirsting
for
vengeance
but
sahwah
escaped
by
swimming
under
water
around
the
dock
and
clambering
out
on
the
rocks
she
made
an
impish
grimace
at
migwan
who
was
standing
on
the
rock
where
she
came
up
migwan
leaned
over
and
put
a
streak
of
soap
on
her
face
sahwah
promptly
caught
migwan
by
the
feet
and
pulled
her
off
the
rock
into
the
water
struggling
they
both
went
under
and
came
up
choking
and
giggling
hinpoha
from
her
airy
perch
in
the
tree
cheered
the
combatants
on
good
work
migwan
hang
on
to
the
rock
that
the
stuff
sahwah
pull
her
off
meanwhile
the
four
racers
at
nyoda
suggestion
had
towed
their
canoes
out
some
distance
from
the
dock
and
were
trying
to
right
them
and
climb
in
this
was
easier
said
than
done
for
as
fast
as
they
splashed
the
water
out
on
one
side
it
ran
in
at
the
other
nyoda
and
medmangi
were
trying
to
get
all
the
water
out
of
theirs
before
getting
in
themselves
while
nakwisi
and
chapa
had
theirs
half
empty
and
had
managed
to
get
in
and
were
splashing
the
water
out
from
both
sides
at
once
sahwah
and
migwan
stopped
ducking
each
other
to
watch
the
righting
process
nakwisi
and
chapa
had
just
triumphantly
paddled
up
to
the
canoe
dock
and
nyoda
and
medmangi
were
just
about
ready
to
start
when
hinpoha
shouted
that
the
was
coming
the
girls
looked
up
to
find
the
little
steamer
hardly
a
hundred
yards
from
the
dock
sahwah
cried
nyoda
hastily
coming
up
on
the
dock
where
is
the
sheet
you
were
going
to
wave
from
the
tower
when
the
came
in
sight
it
up
on
top
said
sahwah
running
for
the
ladder
an
instant
later
she
was
frantically
waving
the
sheet
from
the
top
of
the
tower
there
was
no
time
for
the
girls
to
get
dry
clothes
on
before
the
boat
stopped
beside
the
dock
they
lined
up
all
dripping
except
hinpoha
to
greet
the
newcomer
and
looked
on
expectantly
when
a
young
girl
of
about
sixteen
stepped
ashore
nyoda
advanced
and
held
out
her
hand
welcome
to
camp
winnebago
she
said
cordially
girls
this
is
gladys
evans
our
new
member
whose
father
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
camp
here
this
summer
winnebago
maidens
stand
forth
and
tell
your
names
you
begin
i
am
hinpoha
said
the
girl
addressed
an
extremely
fat
girl
with
an
amazing
quantity
of
bright
red
hair
that
curled
below
her
waist
it
means
haired
i
am
sahwah
the
sunfish
said
a
slim
maiden
with
dancing
eyes
i
chose
the
sun
part
because
i
like
sunshine
and
the
fish
part
because
i
like
to
swim
i
am
very
virtuous
and
a
pattern
of
propriety
the
girls
shouted
with
laughter
my
name
is
migwan
said
the
next
girl
it
means
pen
and
stands
for
my
ambition
to
write
stories
and
things
she
was
a
girl
with
a
beautiful
high
forehead
and
large
dreamy
eyes
so
all
the
girls
introduced
themselves
chapa
the
chipmunk
medmangi
the
medicine
man
girl
and
nakwisi
the
star
maiden
and
this
they
cried
in
unison
encircling
one
of
their
number
with
affectionate
arms
is
nyoda
the
best
guardian
that
ever
lived
how
do
you
do
miss
kent
said
gladys
in
a
high
artificially
sweet
voice
staring
amazedly
at
her
wet
clothes
and
then
around
at
the
dishevelled
group
she
was
a
very
fair
girl
rather
tall
but
slender
and
pale
and
delicate
looking
stuck
up
was
sahwah
mental
estimate
how
do
you
do
girls
she
continued
edging
back
a
little
as
if
she
were
afraid
they
might
also
enfold
her
in
a
wet
embrace
would
you
mind
telling
me
your
names
we
told
you
our
names
said
sahwah
i
mean
your
real
names
answered
gladys
you
do
expect
me
to
remember
all
those
camp
fire
names
do
you
oh
you
learn
them
soon
enough
said
nyoda
we
left
our
old
names
behind
us
when
we
came
to
camp
silence
fell
on
the
group
and
each
girl
was
acutely
conscious
of
her
wet
clothes
sahwah
looked
to
see
migwan
and
gladys
fall
into
each
arms
but
nothing
happened
nyoda
was
busy
checking
over
the
supplies
brought
by
the
boat
the
silence
became
awkward
look
there
an
eagle
shrieked
hinpoha
suddenly
pointing
to
a
large
winged
bird
that
was
circling
slowly
above
the
lake
quick
where
my
glass
said
nakwisi
wait
a
minute
i
get
it
for
you
said
sahwah
and
quick
as
a
flash
she
dove
off
the
end
of
the
dock
coming
up
with
the
in
her
hand
gladys
eyes
nearly
popped
out
of
her
head
as
sahwah
cast
herself
headlong
into
the
water
awfully
sorry
i
dropped
it
in
off
the
tower
said
sahwah
tendering
her
the
glass
will
getting
it
wet
hurt
it
any
nakwisi
screwed
her
beloved
glass
back
and
forth
and
wiped
the
lenses
and
finally
reported
it
unharmed
sahwah
sahwah
said
nyoda
shaking
her
head
you
will
never
learn
to
be
careful
of
other
people
things
sahwah
flushed
i
did
mean
to
be
careless
with
it
it
just
slipped
out
of
my
hand
here
hinpoha
spoke
up
it
all
my
fault
nyoda
she
explained
i
hit
her
with
a
pine
cone
and
made
her
drop
it
nyoda
could
do
nothing
but
laugh
at
the
sparring
that
was
continually
going
on
between
those
two
come
on
girls
she
called
and
get
dry
clothes
on
whoever
gets
dressed
first
may
go
to
the
village
with
me
this
afternoon
the
girls
scurried
up
the
steep
path
like
squirrels
and
nyoda
followed
more
slowly
with
gladys
whose
city
shoes
made
it
hard
for
her
to
climb
as
they
went
up
she
explained
how
she
happened
to
be
so
wet
describing
in
detail
the
upsetting
of
the
canoes
gladys
eyes
opened
wide
at
the
tale
of
sahwah
pranks
how
dreadful
she
said
with
a
shudder
and
nyoda
sighed
inwardly
for
she
realized
that
she
had
a
problem
on
her
hands
gladys
evans
was
not
a
regular
member
of
the
winnebago
camp
fire
she
did
not
attend
the
public
high
school
where
the
other
girls
went
but
went
to
a
private
girls
school
in
the
east
early
in
the
spring
evans
with
whom
miss
kent
was
slightly
acquainted
came
to
her
and
offered
her
group
the
use
of
his
camping
grounds
on
loon
lake
in
maine
for
the
summer
if
they
would
take
gladys
in
and
teach
her
to
do
the
things
they
did
he
had
become
interested
in
the
winnebago
group
through
a
picture
of
them
in
the
newspaper
and
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
gladys
he
and
evans
were
going
on
an
trip
through
canada
with
a
party
of
friends
and
wanted
to
put
gladys
where
she
would
have
a
good
time
he
added
in
confidence
that
gladys
had
been
in
the
company
of
so
much
that
she
felt
altogether
too
grown
up
herself
and
he
wished
her
to
romp
a
whole
summer
in
bloomers
and
forget
about
styles
miss
kent
gladly
accepted
the
charge
aside
from
her
willingness
to
help
gladys
the
offer
of
a
camping
ground
for
the
summer
was
irresistible
all
winter
the
girls
had
been
trying
to
find
a
place
to
camp
for
at
least
a
few
weeks
the
next
summer
and
had
given
a
play
to
raise
the
money
they
had
not
thought
of
going
so
far
away
as
maine
but
now
that
they
could
have
the
camp
without
paying
for
it
they
could
use
the
money
for
railroad
fares
such
a
shout
went
up
from
the
winnebagos
when
miss
kent
broke
the
news
that
passersby
paused
to
listen
they
sang
a
dozen
different
cheers
to
gladys
and
her
father
then
they
cheered
for
the
lake
and
the
camp
and
the
good
time
they
were
going
to
have
until
they
were
too
hoarse
to
speak
gladys
was
then
away
at
school
and
was
to
be
in
new
york
city
with
her
parents
until
the
first
of
july
so
miss
kent
and
her
girls
came
up
the
last
week
in
june
to
open
camp
gladys
had
never
seen
the
place
until
that
day
for
her
father
had
just
bought
it
the
previous
winter
that
she
did
not
want
to
come
was
evident
to
miss
kent
she
was
overdressed
and
rather
supercilious
looking
and
was
not
strong
enough
to
really
enjoy
the
rough
and
tumble
life
of
the
camp
miss
kent
realized
that
some
adjusting
would
be
necessary
before
gladys
would
be
transformed
into
a
genuine
winnebago
but
we
do
it
never
fear
she
thought
brightly
with
the
unquenchable
optimism
that
had
won
for
her
the
name
of
face
toward
the
mountain
chapter
ii
the
council

gladys
of

out
of

into

trimmed
with

on
a
pair
of
beaded
moccasins
what
that
asked
gladys

said
nyoda
follow
the
girls
when
i
call
them
nyoda
slipped
out
of
her
tent
and
disappeared
into
the
woods
in
a
few
minutes
a
clear
call
rang
out
through
the
stillness
wohelo
wohelo
come
ye
all
wohelo
the
girls
stepped
forward
in
a
single
file
their
arms
folded
in
front
of
them
singing
as
they
went
wohelo
wohelo
come
we
all
wohelo
gladys
followed
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
nyoda
stood
in
the
center
of
a
circular
space
about
twenty
feet
across
among
the
trees
completely
surrounded
by
high
pines
in
the
middle
the
fire
was
laid
the
girls
took
their
places
in
the
circle
and
gladys
now
arrayed
in
bloomers
and
middy
with
her
hair
down
in
two
braids
and
a
leather
band
around
her
forehead
sat
under
a
tree
and
looked
on
not
being
a
camp
fire
girl
she
could
not
sit
in
the
council
circle
nyoda
made
fire
with
the
bow
and
drill
and
when
the
leaping
flames
lit
up
the
circle
of
faces
the
girls
sprang
to
their
feet
and
sang
burn
fire
burn
and
then
mystic
fire
with
its
dramatic
gestures
gladys
sitting
in
the
shadows
looked
on
curiously
at
the
fantastically
clad
figures
passing
back
and
forth
around
the
fire
singing
round
the
mystic
ring
faces
in
the
starlight
glow
maids
of
wohelo
praises
to
wokanda
sing
while
the
music
soft
and
low
rubbing
sticks
grind
slow
dusky
forest
now
darker
grown
broods
in
silence
its
own
till
the
wee
spark
to
a
flame
has
blown
and
living
fire
leaps
up
to
greet
the
song
of
wohelo
as
they
chanted
the
words
the
girls
acted
out
with
gestures
the
dancing
ghosts
the
brooding
forest
the
rubbing
sticks
and
the
leaping
fire
so
they
proceeded
through
the
strange
measures
ending
up
in
a
close
circle
around
the
fire
all
making
the
hand
sign
of
fire
together
gladys
began
to
be
stirred
with
a
desire
to
sit
in
the
circle
when
the
girls
were
again
seated
in
their
original
places
and
the
roll
called
nyoda
rose
and
read
the
rules
of
camp
no
one
was
to
leave
the
camp
without
telling
at
least
one
person
where
she
was
going
or
the
general
direction
in
which
she
was
going
and
the
length
of
time
she
expected
to
be
gone
no
candy
was
to
be
bought
in
the
village
no
one
was
to
go
in
swimming
except
at
the
regular
swimming
time
every
one
pointed
a
finger
at
sahwah
when
this
was
read
for
she
had
been
going
into
the
lake
at
least
a
dozen
times
a
day
no
one
could
go
in
swimming
whose
belongings
were
not
in
order
at
tent
inspection
time
a
groan
went
around
the
circle
at
this
nyoda
dwelt
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
rules
governing
the
canoes
no
one
could
go
out
in
a
canoe
who
had
not
taken
the
swimming
test
no
one
could
go
out
in
a
canoe
unless
sahwah
hinpoha
or
herself
were
along
disobedience
to
these
rules
would
mean
having
to
stay
out
of
the
canoes
altogether
she
explained
to
the
girls
the
importance
of
implicit
obedience
to
the
one
in
charge
of
a
boat
regardless
of
personal
feeling
and
how
the
captain
of
a
vessel
had
absolute
authority
over
those
on
board
she
spoke
of
the
necessity
of
coolheadedness
and
courage
on
the
part
of
the
girl
in
charge
and
ability
to
control
her
temper
she
said
she
knew
sahwah
and
hinpoha
were
well
able
to
have
charge
of
a
canoe
and
she
would
never
feel
uneasy
to
have
the
other
girls
go
out
with
them
hinpoha
and
sahwah
flushed
with
pleasure
and
mentally
resolved
to
die
rather
than
prove
unworthy
of
her
trust
gladys
gave
a
little
start
when
the
canoe
rules
were
read
she
could
not
swim
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
going
out
in
a
canoe
very
shortly
the
rest
of
the
rules
dealt
with
the
day
schedule
which
was
as
follows

ceremonial
meeting
would
be
held
every
week
on
monday
night
because
the
girls
had
so
many
opportunities
to
win
honors
now
that
a
whole
month
would
be
too
long
to
wait
after
the
announcements
nyoda
awarded
the
honors
medmangi
had
taken
the
swimming
test
nakwisi
and
chapa
had
righted
an
overturned
canoe
sahwah
had
built
a
reflecting
oven
and
baked
biscuits
in
it
all
the
girls
had
won
some
kind
of
an
honor
gladys
listened
wonderingly
to
the
account
of
the
things
they
had
accomplished
things
she
did
not
have
the
faintest
notion
of
how
to
do
then
came
the
elevating
of
migwan
to
the
rank
of
fire
maker
proudly
she
exhibited
her
fourteen
purple
beads
indicating
the
fulfilment
of
the
fourteen
requirements
nyoda
asked
her
questions
on
the
things
she
had
learned
and
asked
her
to
explain
to
the
girls
how
much
better
she
had
gotten
along
since
she
started
to
keep
an
itemized
account
book
migwan
blushed
and
hung
her
head
for
figures
were
an
abomination
to
her
and
keeping
accounts
a
fearful
task
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
ambition
to
be
a
fire
maker
she
would
never
have
attempted
it
at
all
but
once
having
learned
how
she
realized
their
value
and
heroically
resolved
to
keep
accurate
accounts
right
along
when
it
came
to
the
subject
of
bandaging
she
had
to
give
demonstrations
of
triangular
and
roller
bandaging
with
hinpoha
as
the
subject
then
in
a
clear
earnest
voice
she
dedicated
her
strength
her
ambition
her
heart
desire
her
joy
and
her
sorrow
to
the
keeping
up
of
the
flame
of
love
for
her
fellow
creatures
satisfied
that
migwan
was
a
worthy
candidate
nyoda
slipped
the
silver
bracelet
on
her
arm
and
proclaimed
her
a
fire
maker
migwan
blushed
fiery
red
and
hung
her
head
modestly
speech
speech
shouted
the
girls
give
us
a
poem
migwan
migwan
thought
a
moment
and
then
recited
dramatically
i
am
a
fire
maker
i
have
completed
the
fourteen
requirements
i
have
repeated
the
fire
maker
desire
now
i
may
light
the
great
council
fire
now
i
may
kindle
the
wohelo
candles
long
months
have
i
labored
gathering
firewood
that
i
might
kindle
the
fire
of
wohelo
my
arm
is
encircled
with
a
silver
bracelet
the
outward
symbol
of
the
fire
i
have
kindled
and
those
who
behold
it
shall
say
to
each
other
she
has
labored
she
has
given
service
she
has
pursued
knowledge
she
has
been
trustworthy
fulfilled
the
requirements
she
is
a
fire
maker
that
symbol
is
sacred
a
charm
against
evil
evil
thoughts
and
dark
passions
against
envy
and
hatred
one
step
am
i
nearer
the
goal
of
my
ambition
to
be
a
torch
bearer
is
now
my
desire
to
carry
aloft
the
threefold
flame
the
symbol
of
work
of
health
and
of
love
the
flaming
enveloping
symbol
of
love
triumphant
where
might
fails
i
conquer
by
love
where
i
have
been
led
i
now
will
lead
others
undimmed
will
i
pass
on
the
light
i
have
kindled
the
flame
in
my
hand
shall
mount
higher
and
higher
to
be
a
torch
bearer
is
now
my
desire
a
round
of
applause
followed
next
the
count
was
called
for
this
had
also
been
written
by
migwan
in
rippling
hiawatha
meter
it
told
how
the
winnebagos
had
journeyed
from
their
homes
in
distant
cleveland
to
loon
lake
inviting
waters
how
they
pitched
the
tents
and
made
the
beds
how
they
named
the
tents
alpha
and
omega
how
eagerly
they
awaited
gladys
coming
how
sahwah
was
placed
on
the
tower
to
wave
at
her
and
the
telescope
descending
fell
kersplash
into
the
water
and
all
the
rest
of
the
doings
up
to
the
beginning
of
council
fire
nyoda
then
rose
and
said
that
as
the
camp
fire
was
a
singing
movement
she
wished
the
girls
to
write
as
many
songs
as
possible
and
to
encourage
this
had
worked
out
a
system
of
local
honors
for
songs
which
could
be
sung
by
the
winnebagos
any
girl
writing
the
words
of
a
song
which
was
adopted
for
use
would
receive
a
leather
w
cut
in
the
form
of
wings
to
represent
winged
words
or
poetry
the
honor
for
composing
the
music
for
a
song
would
be
a
winged
note
cut
from
leather
and
the
honor
for
writing
both
words
and
music
would
be
a
combination
of
the
two
these
were
to
be
known
as
the
olowan
honors
because
olowan
was
the
winnebago
word
for
song
and
were
quite
independent
of
the
national
song
honors
because
a
great
many
songs
which
could
not
be
adopted
by
the
national
organization
would
be
admirable
for
use
in
the
local
group
on
account
of
their
aptness
just
before
they
sang
the
goodnight
song
nyoda
drew
gladys
into
the
group
and
officially
invited
her
to
become
a
winnebago
at
the
next
council
fire
gladys
accepted
the
invitation
and
the
girls
sang
a
ringing
cheer
to
her
because
her
coming
made
it
possible
for
them
to
have
the
camp
to
close
the
ceremonial
meeting
the
girls
sang
mammy
moon
ending
up
by
lying
in
a
circle
around
the
fire
their
heads
pillowed
on
one
another
the
fire
was
burning
very
low
now
and
great
shadows
from
the
woods
lay
across
the
open
space
nyoda
stole
silently
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
the
girls
rose
and
filed
past
her
softly
singing
now
our
camp
fire
burning
low
nyoda
held
each
girl
hand
in
a
warm
clasp
for
a
moment
as
she
passed
before
her
and
the
girls
clung
to
her
lovingly
the
forest
was
so
big
and
dark
and
they
were
so
far
from
home
and
nyoda
was
so
strong
and
tender
was
it
wonderful
whispered
migwan
to
sahwah
as
they
picked
their
way
back
to
the
tents
in
the
darkness
was
it
though
answered
sahwah
flashing
her
little
bug
light
on
the
path
before
her
gladys
bed
was
in
the
omega
tent
with
sahwah
hinpoha
and
migwan
one
end
faced
the
lake
and
the
stars
peeked
in
with
friendly
twinkles
while
the
moon
flooded
the
place
with
silver
light
the
three
girls
were
out
of
their
ceremonial
costumes
and
into
their
nightgowns
in
no
time
while
gladys
fussed
around
nervously
are
we
going
to
have
the
lantern
lit
she
asked
what
for
said
sahwah
the
moon
makes
it
as
bright
as
day
gladys
took
off
her
middy
where
are
we
going
to
hang
our
clothes
she
asked
next
throw
them
across
the
foot
of
your
bed
answered
hinpoha
or
lay
them
on
the
stool
or
up
on
the
swinging
shelf
or
hang
them
on
the
floor
the
way
sahwah
does
at
this
sahwah
sat
up
in
bed
and
threw
her
pillow
at
hinpoha
hinpoha
sent
it
back
and
sahwah
threw
it
the
second
time
instead
of
hitting
hinpoha
however
it
landed
in
the
basin
of
water
in
which
gladys
was
trying
to
wash
herself
knocking
it
off
the
stand
and
out
of
the
tent
door
gladys
gave
an
exclamation
of
impatience
sahwah
hastened
to
apologize
i
awfully
sorry
gladys
but
you
saw
how
it
was
i
was
trying
to
hit
and
hit
you
by
mistake
here
the
laughter
of
the
three
girls
broke
forth
and
they
shouted
in
unison
gladys
did
not
laugh
i
get
you
some
more
water
said
sahwah
getting
out
of
bed
the
pail
was
empty
so
sahwah
went
all
the
way
down
to
the
lake
for
water
on
the
way
back
she
rescued
the
pillow
which
was
soaking
wet
and
stood
it
up
against
the
tent
pole
to
dry
just
then
came
a
loud
hail
from
the
other
tent
goodnight
omegas
good
night
alphas
they
answered
sleep
tight
again
came
the
fourfold
voice
out
of
alpha
goodnight
gladys
gladys
was
finally
ready
for
bed
you
are
going
to
leave
the
sides
of
the
tent
rolled
up
all
night
are
you
she
asked
in
a
horrified
tone
we
surely
are
said
sahwah
we
always
do
what
if
it
rains
plenty
of
time
then
to
put
them
down
gladys
stood
irresolute
beside
the
bed
we
put
your
side
down
if
you
prefer
it
said
migwan
but
really
pleasanter
with
it
up
it
seemed
rather
airy
to
me
at
first
but
now
i
would
have
it
down
for
anything
do
trouble
yourself
said
gladys
sure
i
put
it
down
said
migwan
making
a
motion
to
rise
but
just
then
the
second
bugle
rang
out
and
she
subsided
gladys
got
into
bed
and
pulled
the
blankets
over
her
head
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
slept
out
of
doors
she
felt
very
small
and
lonesome
and
neglected
she
had
not
wanted
to
come
to
this
camp
the
least
bit
other
summers
she
had
always
gone
to
atlantic
city
or
some
other
crowded
lively
summer
resort
with
her
parents
where
she
had
received
considerable
attention
from
young
men
just
like
the
older
girls
with
whom
she
associated
here
banished
to
the
silent
woods
she
saw
the
summer
stretch
out
endlessly
before
her
intolerably
dull
and
uninteresting
she
loved
fluffy
clothes
and
despised
the
bloomers
and
middies
which
the
girls
wore
she
loved
dainty
table
service
and
hated
to
cook
up
here
she
would
be
expected
to
help
with
the
meals
and
all
there
was
to
cook
on
was
an
open
fire
and
a
gasoline
stove
what
could
her
father
have
been
thinking
of
to
want
her
to
join
such
a
club
these
girls
were
not
in
her
own
class
they
went
to
public
school
they
were
rough
and
horrid
and
threw
each
other
into
the
water
gladys
could
not
go
to
sleep
she
tossed
restlessly
thinking
rebellious
thoughts
and
shuddering
at
the
night
noises
in
the
woods
the
lapping
of
the
water
on
the
rocks
below
had
a
lonesome
sound
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
hear
its
soft
crooning
lullaby
the
wind
rustled
in
the
pine
trees
with
a
ghostly
mysterious
sound
from
somewhere
in
the
woods
came
a
mournful
cry
that
sent
the
chills
up
and
down
her
spine
it
was
only
a
whippoorwill
but
gladys
did
not
know
a
whippoorwill
from
a
bluebird
then
the
frogs
in
a
distant
pool
began
their
concert
blub
blub
better
go
round
better
go
round
skeel
skeek
skeel
skeek
blub
glub
chralk
gladys
eyes
started
out
of
her
head
at
the
unearthly
noises
her
nerves
were
just
about
on
edge
from
their
incessant
piping
when
suddenly
a
long
eerie
laugh
rang
out
over
the
water
she
screamed
aloud
and
sat
up
in
bed
what
the
matter
said
migwan
waking
up
what
was
it
oh
what
was
it
asked
gladys
in
a
voice
cold
with
terror
what
was
what
said
migwan
just
then
the
sound
rang
out
again
that
said
gladys
why
that
nothing
but
a
loon
answered
migwan
is
it
lovely
and
she
fell
asleep
again
but
slumber
would
not
come
to
gladys
the
bed
sagged
in
the
middle
and
she
could
not
get
herself
adjusted
to
it
she
was
finally
in
the
act
of
dozing
off
when
the
bed
collapsed
with
a
jarring
crash
instantly
the
whole
camp
was
awake
migwan
jumped
up
and
lit
the
lantern
and
nyoda
came
running
over
from
alpha
to
see
what
was
the
matter
there
was
much
laughter
over
the
mishap
but
unfortunately
gladys
got
the
idea
that
sahwah
who
had
giggled
uncontrollably
from
the
start
was
responsible
for
the
bed
going
down
you
made
it
fall
down
she
said
to
her
and
burst
into
tears
sahwah
stared
at
her
open
mouthed
i
never
touched
it
she
declared
nyoda
hastened
to
smooth
things
over
nobody
made
your
bed
collapse
dear
she
said
putting
her
arm
around
gladys
it
a
trick
camp
beds
have
gladys
went
on
crying
however
so
nyoda
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
talked
soothingly
to
her
she
realized
that
gladys
felt
strange
in
camp
and
was
probably
homesick
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
girls
had
received
her
with
open
arms
so
to
divert
the
girl
attention
from
herself
she
pointed
out
the
constellations
blazing
in
the
sky
and
told
some
of
their
stories
and
gladys
gradually
relaxed
and
fell
asleep
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
it
was
broad
daylight
and
the
sun
was
shining
into
the
tent
she
looked
around
at
the
others
hinpoha
was
still
asleep
migwan
was
coaxing
a
chipmunk
up
on
the
bed
with
peanuts
sahwah
was
noiselessly
getting
into
her
bathing
suit
seeing
that
gladys
was
awake
both
girls
waved
their
arms
in
friendly
greeting
talking
was
not
allowed
before
the
first
bugle
there
was
a
soft
scurry
of
little
feet
on
the
floor
and
another
chipmunk
darted
in
and
paused
inquiringly
beside
bed
migwan
tossed
her
some
peanuts
and
gladys
held
one
out
gingerly
to
the
little
creature
he
hopped
up
boldly
and
took
it
from
her
fingers
stuffing
it
into
his
baggy
cheek
then
his
bright
little
eyes
spied
the
rest
of
the
peanuts
on
gladys
bed
and
quick
as
a
wink
he
was
up
after
them
his
tail
whisking
right
into
her
face
gladys
screamed
and
wriggled
and
he
fled
for
his
life
pausing
a
short
distance
from
the
tent
to
scold
about
the
peanuts
he
had
left
behind
in
his
flight
just
then
the
bugle
blew
and
with
a
whoop
sahwah
leapt
from
bed
while
migwan
rose
and
donned
her
bathing
suit
coming
in
for
a
dip
gladys
she
asked
is
the
water
cold
asked
gladys
well
yes
said
migwan
honestly
it
usually
is
in
the
morning
before
the
sun
has
shone
very
long
on
it
gladys
decided
she
would
not
take
a
dip
hinpoha
slumbered
calmly
on
sahwah
pulled
the
pillow
from
under
her
head
with
a
quick
jerk
and
plucked
the
blankets
off
hinpoha
opened
her
eyes
sleepily
wake
up
lazy
bones
said
sahwah
it
time
to
dip
have
a
heart
mumbled
hinpoha
opening
her
eyes
a
little
farther
the
bugle
has
blown
yet
indeed
it
has
a
whole
minute
ago
hurry
up
or
you
miss
the
dip
sahwah
prodded
hinpoha
energetically
hinpoha
struggled
into
her
bathing
suit
and
sped
down
the
path
to
the
lake
hot
in
pursuit
of
sahwah
migwan
had
already
gone
down
a
minute
later
the
girls
from
the
other
tent
ran
out
calling
a
cheery
to
gladys
a
series
of
splashes
and
shrieks
followed
which
proclaimed
the
coldness
of
the
water
gladys
lay
cozily
in
bed
watching
the
chipmunks
as
they
scampered
across
the
floor
of
the
tent
presently
another
bugle
sounded
from
somewhere
and
the
girls
returned
dripping
and
rosy
to
hustle
into
middies
and
bloomers
are
you
going
to
get
up
gladys
asked
migwan
that
second
bugle
means
up
you
know
does
it
said
gladys
and
rose
reluctantly
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
just
gone
to
sleep
she
was
still
combing
her
hair
before
the
tiny
mirror
that
hung
on
the
tent
pole
swinging
in
the
wind
when
the
breakfast
bugle
blew
migwan
waited
for
her
dutifully
and
escorted
her
to
the
mess
tent
where
the
other
girls
were
already
gathered
around
the
table
we
call
it
the
tent
until
we
can
find
a
prettier
name
for
it
explained
migwan
sahwah
thinks
we
should
call
it
the
gorge
have
you
anything
to
suggest
no
replied
gladys
i
have
nyoda
greeted
gladys
cordially
and
asked
how
she
slept
and
the
other
girls
sang
her
a
kindergarten
good
morning
song
making
funny
little
bows
and
bobs
then
they
sang
the
camp
fire
grace
if
we
have
earned
the
right
to
eat
this
bread
and
set
to
work
making
the
fruit
and
pancakes
and
cocoa
disappear
like
magic
gladys
ate
nearly
as
much
as
the
others
although
she
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
if
you
had
told
her
so
the
meal
over
each
girl
carried
her
dishes
and
stacked
them
in
a
neat
pile
on
the
table
in
the
tiny
kitchen
which
formed
a
part
of
the
small
wooden
shack
which
stood
on
the
camp
grounds
and
dropped
her
cup
into
a
pan
of
water
this
made
very
light
work
for
the
dishes
committee
which
consisted
of
two
different
girls
each
week
the
dishes
committee
took
care
of
all
three
meals
a
day
for
the
entire
week
as
this
duty
did
not
require
much
time
but
there
was
a
different
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
committee
each
pair
serving
a
whole
week
at
their
job
up
until
gladys
arrival
there
had
been
only
seven
in
camp
and
nyoda
had
been
working
alone
but
now
the
division
was
equal
gladys
was
assigned
to
the
supper
committee
for
the
rest
of
the
week
with
migwan
as
a
partner
for
nyoda
thought
it
would
help
her
get
acquainted
faster
to
let
her
work
with
one
of
the
girls
as
soon
as
the
dishes
were
washed
the
girls
gathered
in
the
front
part
of
the
shack
where
there
was
an
old
piano
and
sang
hymns
and
camp
songs
let
pick
out
some
hymns
to
learn
by
heart
suggested
nyoda
think
how
lovely
they
sound
sung
out
on
the
lake
in
canoes
nyoda
suggestion
found
favor
with
the
girls
and
they
set
immediately
to
work
learning
the
crusaders
hymn
do
you
know
said
nyoda
from
her
seat
on
the
piano
stool
after
they
had
sung
it
through
a
couple
of
times
i
believe
that
the
last
verse
of
that
song
should
be
sung
first
the
climax
seems
be
in
the
first
verse
and
the
rest
beginning
with
the
last
merely
lead
up
to
it
try
it
that
way
once
the
girls
sang
it
through
in
the
new
order
and
declared
they
liked
the
effect
much
better
so
the
change
was
adopted
migwan
and
nyoda
sang
a
strong
alto
and
sahwah
a
clear
though
somewhat
uncertain
high
tenor
so
the
little
band
succeeded
in
making
a
considerable
amount
of
harmony
a
tiny
song
bird
perched
on
the
limb
of
a
tall
pine
tree
just
before
the
shack
blended
his
notes
with
theirs
and
poured
out
his
enjoyment
of
the
universe
in
a
thrilling
flood
of
song
the
girls
sang
their
hymn
over
and
over
again
just
to
hear
him
join
in
until
nyoda
looking
at
her
watch
exclaimed
ten
minutes
until
tent
inspection
the
girls
scattered
to
their
tents
and
began
a
hasty
cleaning
up
gladys
had
never
made
a
bed
before
and
had
trouble
getting
hers
straight
and
smooth
but
migwan
took
a
hand
and
showed
her
how
to
spread
the
sheets
evenly
and
tuck
them
in
neatly
her
night
gown
she
folded
and
tucked
under
the
pillow
one
quarter
of
this
swinging
shelf
belongs
to
you
gladys
so
you
might
as
well
put
some
of
your
stuff
up
here
she
said
when
the
bed
was
finished
as
well
as
part
of
the
table
and
the
washstand
she
moved
things
around
as
she
spoke
leaving
spaces
clear
for
gladys
possessions
we
are
supposed
to
have
anything
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
shelf
or
out
of
the
compartment
of
the
table
she
explained
as
she
moved
about
nothing
is
to
be
left
on
the
bed
except
one
sweater
or
one
folded
up
blanket
and
not
more
than
two
pairs
of
shoes
under
the
bed
our
towels
and
bathing
suits
are
to
be
hung
on
the
tent
flies
as
inconspicuously
as
possible
we
also
clean
up
our
dooryards
and
see
that
there
is
no
waste
paper
about
what
happens
if
everything
is
in
applepie
order
asked
gladys
mentally
remarking
that
such
rules
were
an
unnecessary
nuisance
we
get
marked
down
in
tent
inspection
and
if
our
things
are
left
in
very
bad
order
we
forfeit
our
swimming
hour
for
that
day
besides
we
are
all
working
for
the
camp
craft
honor
of
doing
the
work
in
a
tent
for
a
week
and
if
the
tent
is
properly
cared
for
it
does
count
toward
the
honor
more
than
all
that
the
two
tents
are
racing
to
see
which
one
gets
the
highest
average
at
the
end
of
the
summer
for
nyoda
has
offered
a
banner
to
the
members
of
the
winning
family
she
had
hardly
finished
her
explanation
when
the
bugle
announced
the
imminent
approach
of
nyoda
on
her
tour
of
inspection
and
the
three
girls
ran
from
the
tent
pulling
gladys
with
them
the
matter
panted
gladys
what
are
we
running
away
for
we
never
stay
in
the
tent
while
it
being
inspected
explained
migwan
nyoda
tells
us
our
standing
during
craft
hour
and
what
the
matter
was
if
there
was
anything
and
the
weekly
averages
are
to
be
read
at
council
fire
the
girls
settled
down
to
craft
work
in
the
shack
for
they
had
chosen
that
as
their
workroom
on
account
of
the
hinged
shelves
around
the
walls
which
were
so
convenient
to
spread
work
out
on
the
front
wall
of
the
shack
facing
the
lake
was
all
windows
which
could
be
lowered
making
the
room
as
cool
and
airy
as
could
be
desired
the
special
work
which
the
girls
had
just
begun
was
the
painting
of
their
paddles
with
their
symbols
gladys
having
neither
paddle
nor
symbol
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
here
take
the
symbol
book
said
migwan
and
begin
working
on
your
symbol
gladys
took
the
book
and
began
idly
turning
the
pages
symbolism
was
an
entirely
new
thing
to
her
and
she
was
unable
to
decide
on
any
of
the
queerly
shaped
things
in
the
little
book
i
ca
find
a
thing
that
i
like
she
said
to
nyoda
when
she
joined
the
girls
in
the
shack
have
you
decided
on
a
name
asked
nyoda
gladys
shook
her
head
well
then
said
nyoda
i
would
wait
with
the
symbol
until
i
had
chosen
a
name
and
i
would
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
about
it
either
take
time
to
look
about
you
and
make
your
name
express
something
that
you
like
to
do
better
than
anything
else
or
something
that
you
earnestly
aspire
to
do
or
be
then
choose
your
symbol
in
keeping
with
your
name
but
suppose
there
should
be
a
symbol
in
the
book
that
fitted
the
name
i
chose
asked
gladys
then
we
would
be
put
to
the
painful
necessity
of
finding
a
brand
new
one
answered
nyoda
with
a
mock
tragic
air
here
the
others
girls
flung
themselves
upon
nyoda
and
demanded
to
be
told
their
standing
in
tent
inspection
alpha
omega
she
replied
the
omegas
hugged
each
other
with
joy
at
having
received
a
higher
mark
than
the
alphas
what
was
wrong
with
us
chorused
the
disappointed
alphas
one
bed
had
not
been
swept
under
one
pair
of
shoes
were
lying
down
instead
of
standing
up
and
the
wash
bowl
contained
a
answered
nyoda
nakwisi
blushed
at
the
mention
of
the
i
did
mean
to
leave
it
there
really
and
truly
i
did
nyoda
i
was
just
looking
over
the
lake
when
chapa
wanted
me
to
help
her
move
her
bed
and
i
laid
it
in
the
first
convenient
place
and
then
forgot
to
remove
it
no
explanations
called
the
girls
nakwisi
laughed
and
subsided
where
did
we
lose
our
two
points
nyoda
demanded
the
omegas
there
was
a
pillow
propped
against
the
tent
pole
and
one
bed
looked
decidedly
lumpy
said
nyoda
i
knew
you
go
off
and
leave
that
pillow
there
sahwah
exclaimed
hinpoha
i
knew
your
shoes
would
show
if
you
tried
to
hide
them
in
the
bed
returned
sahwah
murder
will
out
said
nyoda
laughing
i
was
not
going
to
mention
any
names
chapter
iii
independence
day
girls
exclaimed
nyoda
one
day
at
the
dinner
table
is
the
fourth
of
july
shall
we
have
a
celebration
sahwah
looked
at
hinpoha
and
slowly
lowered
one
eyelid
yes
yes
cried
all
the
girls
in
chorus
let
do
well
what
shall
it
be
continued
nyoda
a
flag
raising
and
a
bonfire
and
some
canoe
races
oh
a
flag
raising
by
all
means
said
migwan
they
always
have
one
in
the
scout
camps
my
brother
is
a
scout
and
he
thinks
awful
because
we
do
have
more
flag
exercises
where
will
we
get
the
flag
asked
sahwah
it
here
already
answered
nyoda
in
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
we
would
want
it
so
i
brought
it
along
who
will
do
the
raising
asked
hinpoha
why
nyoda
of
course
said
migwan
who
else
and
i
move
said
nyoda
that
migwan
write
a
poem
suitable
to
the
occasion
and
deliver
same
yes
yes
cried
all
the
girls
a
poem
from
migwan
migwan
demurred
at
first
but
finally
promised
just
as
she
always
did
wait
a
minute
said
sahwah
suddenly
where
are
we
going
to
get
the
pole
to
raise
the
flag
on
all
the
girls
looked
blank
for
a
moment
we
run
it
up
on
the
diving
tower
said
nyoda
promptly
we
can
find
a
small
dry
tree
in
the
woods
and
strip
the
branches
off
and
fasten
it
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
run
the
flag
up
on
it
there
that
settled
now
what
kind
of
water
sports
shall
we
have
sahwah
and
hinpoha
exchanged
glances
and
sahwah
wriggled
in
her
chair
would
you
like
a
committee
to
arrange
that
she
asked
trying
to
make
her
voice
sound
natural
and
disinterested
why
yes
that
would
be
a
good
idea
said
nyoda
and
i
appoint
you
and
hinpoha
as
the
committee
to
do
the
arranging
i
am
very
glad
you
suggested
that
for
it
leaves
me
free
to
go
to
the
village
this
afternoon
now
do
we
need
any
more
committees
there
ought
to
be
one
on
seating
arrangements
said
sahwah
on
what
asked
nyoda
seating
arrangements
repeated
sahwah
where
to
place
our
guests
may
i
ask
who
our
guests
are
going
to
be
said
nyoda
i
do
know
yet
myself
said
sahwah
calmly
but
we
ought
to
have
some
it
would
be
sort
of
flat
to
have
a
celebration
just
for
ourselves
we
all
have
to
be
in
it
and
there
wo
be
any
audience
how
would
you
feel
like
giving
a
show
for
benefit
so
i
thought
we
do
it
this
we
have
a
committee
on
seating
arrangements
and
they
would
have
to
furnish
the
audience
as
well
as
the
seats
is
that
a
good
idea
it
an
original
one
anyway
said
nyoda
somewhat
breathlessly
however
i
think
you
are
quite
right
if
there
is
an
audience
to
be
had
by
all
means
let
us
have
one
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
it
may
not
be
the
easiest
thing
to
pick
up
an
audience
in
the
maine
woods
there
are
other
campers
around
the
lake
replied
sahwah
and
there
are
the
people
in
the
village
we
could
bring
them
here
in
the
boats
they
might
have
plans
of
their
own
though
said
nyoda
so
we
must
count
too
much
on
having
them
come
to
visit
us
by
the
way
sahwah
whom
would
you
suggest
for
a
committee
oh
you
would
be
the
best
one
for
that
nyoda
answered
sahwah
nyoda
bowed
laughing
i
accept
the
position
of
audience
furnisher
she
said
formally
now
every
man
to
his
task
gladys
would
you
like
to
come
to
the
village
with
me
this
afternoon
sahwah
and
hinpoha
also
went
to
the
village
but
they
waited
until
nyoda
was
well
out
of
sight
then
they
paddled
across
the
lake
with
strong
swift
strokes
that
sent
the
canoe
fairly
flying
through
the
water
i
thought
nyoda
would
want
some
kind
of
a
celebration
said
sahwah
so
it
a
good
thing
we
have
our
plans
made
although
we
did
want
them
to
be
a
complete
surprise
instead
of
getting
out
at
the
regular
landing
they
paddled
around
the
village
and
up
the
mouth
of
a
small
creek
where
they
beached
the
canoe
and
crept
stealthily
toward
the
store
after
peeking
through
the
window
and
satisfying
themselves
that
nyoda
was
not
within
sahwah
entered
while
hinpoha
kept
watch
in
the
doorway
did
you
get
everything
asked
hinpoha
as
sahwah
emerged
with
her
arms
full
of
bundles
sahwah
nodded
but
it
took
every
yard
of
bunting
they
had
they
hastened
back
to
camp
and
preparations
for
the
next
celebration
were
soon
under
way
when
nyoda
returned
at
supper
time
she
was
immediately
surrounded
by
an
eager
group
clamoring
to
know
who
was
going
to
be
the
audience
nyoda
shook
her
head
sadly
there
ai
no
such
animal
she
replied
tragically
we
stopped
everybody
we
met
on
the
street
in
the
village
we
only
met
five
people
and
invited
them
we
invited
the
storekeeper
and
the
man
who
rents
the
boats
but
none
of
them
could
come
then
we
went
around
to
the
houses
to
see
if
we
could
find
some
women
and
girls
but
with
the
same
result
it
seems
that
some
local
magnate
is
giving
a
barbecue
out
at
his
farm
and
the
whole
town
is
invited
but
the
other
campers
said
sahwah
hopefully
again
nyoda
shook
her
head
we
took
the
launch
and
ran
in
at
every
landing
for
several
miles
around
there
are
so
many
campers
up
here
yet
as
you
might
think
a
great
many
of
the
cottages
were
closed
the
few
people
we
did
talk
to
had
their
plans
already
made
do
look
so
disappointed
sahwah
if
we
were
out
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
or
shipwrecked
on
a
lonely
island
there
would
be
any
possibility
of
an
audience
and
yet
we
would
be
having
a
celebration
for
our
own
benefit
just
the
same
of
course
we
would
said
migwan
stoutly
and
to
tell
the
truth
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
to
ask
any
one
else
to
our
celebration
i
think
it
lovely
to
have
it
just
by
ourselves
i
tell
you
what
we
do
said
hinpoha
with
a
burst
of
inspiration
we
take
turns
being
the
audience
the
seating
committee
can
usher
us
to
our
seats
between
our
own
performances
and
we
can
pretend
that
we
do
know
what
is
coming
you
forget
that
i
for
one
do
know
what
is
coming
said
nyoda
and
will
be
a
very
appreciative
spectator
indeed
behold
me
ladies
at
your
service
the
audience
and
nyoda
swept
them
a
low
curtsey
whereupon
they
fell
on
her
neck
with
one
accord
sahwah
woke
with
the
dawn
the
next
morning
and
craned
her
neck
to
look
at
the
weather
to
her
great
disappointment
the
lake
was
covered
with
a
heavy
mist
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
sun
the
woods
looked
dark
and
gloomy
rain
she
exclaimed
tragically
and
buried
her
head
in
the
blankets
the
clouds
were
still
thick
at
breakfast
time
although
no
actual
rain
had
fallen
the
flag
raising
took
place
right
after
breakfast
with
due
ceremony
up
went
the
stars
and
stripes
without
a
pause
and
just
as
it
reached
the
top
of
the
pole
and
yielded
its
folds
to
the
breeze
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
bathed
it
in
a
golden
glory
the
girls
cheered
and
burst
into
a
lusty
rendition
of
the
star
spangled
banner
after
which
migwan
patriotic
poem
was
recited
amid
much
applause
then
began
the
water
sports
which
opened
with
canoe
races
the
four
who
were
not
in
this
took
their
seats
on
the
shore
being
placed
by
nyoda
with
great
formality
and
passed
from
hand
to
hand
hinpoha
and
nakwisi
and
sahwah
and
migwan
were
partners
in
the
races
first
they
raced
for
distance
paddling
around
the
nearest
island
and
coming
back
to
the
dock
hinpoha
and
nakwisi
came
out
ahead
because
migwan
who
was
paddling
stem
in
her
canoe
lost
time
steering
around
the
island
then
came
an
obstacle
race
in
which
the
girls
paddled
up
to
the
dock
disembarked
dragged
the
canoes
across
the
dock
and
launched
them
again
on
the
other
side
again
hinpoha
and
nakwisi
won
then
came
a
race
between
the
two
crews
with
the
paddlers
standing
on
the
gunwales
which
tested
the
skill
of
the
girls
to
the
uttermost
with
superhuman
effort
they
kept
their
balance
and
came
sweeping
in
neck
and
neck
the
watchers
on
shore
cheering
lustily
go
it
hinpoha
shouted
nyoda
and
hinpoha
raised
her
head
to
look
at
her
lost
her
balance
and
upset
the
canoe
leaving
sahwah
and
migwan
the
victors
the
spectators
applauded
heartily
and
sang
cheers
for
the
winners
when
suddenly
the
applause
was
echoed
from
behind
them
nyoda
wheeled
swiftly
around
and
faced
two
gentlemen
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
path
leading
to
the
dock
as
she
turned
they
came
forward
hats
in
hand
the
elder
man
spoke
i
am
professor
bentley
of
harvard
university
and
this
is
professor
wheeler
nyoda
graciously
acknowledged
the
introductions
we
have
been
staying
at
the
other
end
of
the
lake
resumed
the
stranger
and
intended
to
return
home
but
missed
the
steamer
we
were
told
that
a
steamer
passed
wharton
landing
at
noon
so
we
walked
over
for
it
can
you
tell
us
which
is
wharton
landing
that
is
wharton
landing
directly
opposite
replied
nyoda
but
the
steamer
has
already
gone
past
there
is
a
different
schedule
on
holidays
however
it
passes
again
at
six
this
evening
wo
you
be
our
guests
until
then
we
can
take
you
across
in
the
launch
the
strangers
accepted
the
invitation
and
nyoda
introduced
the
other
girls
professor
wheeler
looked
long
and
hard
at
hinpoha
he
seemed
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
her
hair
and
now
said
professor
bentley
when
they
were
all
comfortably
seated
upon
the
rocks
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
are
and
what
you
were
doing
when
we
came
up
we
are
camp
fire
girls
they
cried
in
chorus
and
celebrating
the
fourth
of
july
so
you
camp
fire
girls
are
you
answered
professor
bentley
that
is
a
species
of
the
female
that
i
am
greatly
interested
in
how
fortunate
that
i
should
have
come
upon
them
in
their
native
wilds
is
this
where
you
hibernate
excuse
me
i
mean
sunburnate
he
wanted
to
ask
a
great
many
questions
about
the
girls
but
professor
wheeler
was
anxious
for
the
water
sports
to
continue
the
audience
exclaimed
sahwah
in
a
rapturous
aside
to
hinpoha
it
fell
right
kerplunk
off
the
knees
of
the
gods
sahwah
who
was
by
far
the
best
diver
in
camp
now
performed
a
series
of
spectacular
dives
which
she
had
been
practising
early
and
late
including
forward
backward
somersault
angel
sailor
and
springboard
from
the
top
of
the
tower
then
she
produced
a
hoop
which
she
made
hinpoha
hold
while
she
dove
through
it
forward
and
backward
from
the
high
springboard
she
ended
her
number
with
what
she
called
the
wohelo
dive
in
which
she
jumped
from
the
dock
to
the
low
springboard
landing
in
a
sitting
position
bounced
up
three
times
for
work
health
and
love
and
then
turned
a
somersault
into
the
water
whew
whistled
professor
bentley
what
a
diver
she
a
regular
annette
kellerman
this
was
repeated
to
sahwah
later
to
her
great
gratification
after
the
diving
was
over
the
girls
did
a
stunt
which
called
for
a
great
deal
of
endurance
it
was
invented
by
sahwah
and
called
a
submarine
race
sahwah
hinpoha
and
nakwisi
the
three
girls
who
could
swim
under
water
each
tied
a
toy
balloon
around
her
neck
and
jumping
from
the
dock
on
signal
swam
beneath
the
surface
to
see
who
could
reach
the
shore
without
coming
up
for
air
the
balloons
of
course
stayed
in
the
air
and
indicated
the
progress
of
the
swimmers
this
stunt
amused
both
the
visitors
highly
and
they
grew
quite
excited
over
which
one
was
going
to
stay
down
the
longest
i
bet
on
the
red
balloon
said
professor
bentley
who
knew
that
sahwah
was
attached
to
it
the
green
one
for
mine
answered
professor
wheeler
who
was
keeping
his
eye
on
hinpoha
it
was
the
weirdest
thing
said
migwan
afterward
to
see
those
balloons
go
darting
and
wobbling
back
and
forth
and
the
weirdest
feeling
when
you
were
attached
to
them
said
sahwah
i
felt
like
the
keel
of
a
boat
when
the
sails
are
full
of
wind
the
second
part
of
the
program
was
a
series
of
tableaux
showing
events
of
american
history
the
first
represented
washington
crossing
the
delaware
the
sponson
a
canoe
with
air
tanks
in
the
sides
came
into
view
around
the
cliff
propelled
by
one
paddler
in
the
stern
in
the
bottom
sat
two
devoted
patriots
carrying
hatchets
the
great
george
stood
in
the
bow
in
defiance
of
all
canoe
laws
with
one
foot
up
on
the
bow
point
his
hand
on
his
sword
his
eyes
on
the
distant
shore
his
hair
had
turned
bright
red
and
he
had
taken
on
considerable
flesh
since
his
friends
had
seen
him
last
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
military
attitude
in
the
water
around
the
sponson
floated
a
number
of
water
wings
tied
to
the
boat
to
represent
floating
ice
cakes
the
audience
applauded
vigorously
as
the
skiff
drew
near
at
the
psychological
moment
when
nyoda
had
her
camera
focused
for
a
snap
a
huge
mosquito
settled
on
george
extended
calf
he
uttered
a
sudden
yell
brought
his
hand
down
on
his
leg
and
pitched
headfirst
into
the
water
the
patriots
rescued
him
and
set
him
on
the
dock
and
professor
wheeler
who
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
rescue
himself
sat
down
again
amid
the
general
laughter
what
next
he
murmured
chuckling
extravagantly
the
next
was
an
episode
entitled
the
pirates
of
tripoli
chapa
medmangi
and
nakwisi
came
swaggering
out
on
the
dock
dressed
as
pirates
with
turbans
and
sashes
and
fearful
knives
stuck
in
their
belts
singing
fifteen
men
on
a
dead
chest
striking
piratical
attitudes
on
the
end
of
the
dock
they
sang
the
pirate
song
from
peter
pan
making
savage
gestures
and
pointing
downward
dramatically
at
the
line
we
sure
to
meet
below
chorus
over
the
captain
bold
set
his
men
to
swabbing
decks
and
ordered
the
watch
up
aloft
on
the
tower
to
plant
the
flag
with
the
skull
and
crossbones
and
keep
the
lookout
boldly
he
paced
up
and
down
on
top
of
the
tower
sweeping
the
seas
with
his
suddenly
he
paused
and
uttered
a
shout
the
pirates
crowded
to
the
edge
of
the
dock
looking
in
the
direction
he
pointed
they
beheld
two
sailors
approaching
in
a
small
open
boat
seeing
the
pirates
the
sailors
were
overcome
with
terror
and
tried
to
avoid
passing
the
dock
but
the
ruthless
flung
out
a
rope
and
lassoed
them
pulling
them
up
on
the
dock
they
blindfolded
them
and
tied
their
hands
behind
them
then
in
spite
of
pitiful
shrieks
for
mercy
the
pirate
captain
ordered
the
poor
sailors
up
the
ladder
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
made
them
walk
the
plank
off
the
high
springboard
still
blindfolded
it
was
so
thrilling
the
audience
squealed
with
excitement
as
sahwah
jumped
she
flung
out
her
arms
in
a
despairing
gesture
and
wobbled
beautifully
all
the
way
down
through
the
air
it
was
migwan
though
who
created
the
most
merriment
the
two
sailors
were
dressed
very
correctly
in
white
duck
trousers
middies
and
sailor
caps
the
trousers
were
part
of
the
outfit
that
sahwah
had
purchased
in
the
village
the
day
before
and
the
pair
that
fell
to
migwan
were
much
too
big
for
her
when
it
came
her
turn
to
walk
the
plank
she
remembered
sahwah
parting
injunction
to
hang
on
to
whatever
you
do
and
in
a
sudden
panic
lest
she
should
fall
out
of
them
in
her
flight
through
the
air
she
grabbed
them
firmly
by
both
sides
of
the
belt
and
jumped
in
that
position
the
watchers
on
the
beach
were
convulsed
and
struggled
for
some
minutes
to
regain
their
composure
the
last
tableau
brought
tears
to
nyoda
eyes
tears
of
joy
and
pride
around
the
cliff
came
a
gay
craft
moving
slowly
and
majestically
through
the
water
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
paddle
as
it
drew
nearer
the
watchers
saw
that
it
was
a
canoe
its
sides
covered
with
red
white
and
blue
bunting
before
it
swam
sahwah
and
medmangi
inside
on
a
seat
sat
hinpoha
dressed
as
columbia
with
a
crown
on
her
head
her
glorious
hair
rippling
down
to
her
waist
and
shining
like
copper
in
the
sunlight
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
torch
in
the
other
she
held
two
white
streamers
these
streamers
were
fastened
to
sahwah
and
medmangi
waists
who
drew
the
canoe
as
they
swam
the
spectators
drew
a
long
breath
and
exclaimed
with
delight
professor
wheeler
sprang
to
his
feet
camera
in
hand
and
snapped
the
ship
of
state
at
least
a
dozen
times
glory
what
a
head
of
hair
he
muttered
to
himself
the
cortege
approached
the
dock
and
those
on
shore
thrilled
with
a
fearful
realism
as
the
swimmers
reared
up
their
heads
and
blew
jets
of
water
out
through
their
mouths
and
noses
just
like
sea
horses
as
the
boat
passed
the
dock
the
watchers
with
one
accord
stood
and
sang
america
and
kept
on
singing
until
it
had
vanished
from
sight
around
the
next
cliff
great
cried
professor
bentley
applauding
until
he
was
red
in
the
face
great
when
the
three
girls
came
out
on
the
beach
after
having
changed
their
fancy
costumes
they
were
met
with
another
round
of
applause
that
little
pageant
of
yours
said
professor
bentley
was
about
the
neatest
thing
i
have
ever
seen
was
it
an
original
idea
the
girls
proudly
replied
that
it
was
and
not
only
original
added
nyoda
but
executed
entirely
without
my
help
the
whole
program
was
a
surprise
to
me
you
do
say
so
said
professor
bentley
well
all
i
can
say
is
you
are
a
pretty
clever
lot
of
girls
chapa
had
been
busy
for
the
last
few
minutes
gathering
driftwood
and
getting
a
fire
started
the
girls
had
decided
to
cook
dinner
down
on
the
beach
in
order
to
show
the
visitors
their
skill
in
cooking
in
the
most
primitive
way
a
big
kettle
of
clams
was
hung
over
a
fire
all
its
own
while
another
fire
was
kindled
between
two
long
logs
and
the
pots
and
pans
set
along
on
it
in
a
row
migwan
tended
the
clams
sahwah
put
on
a
kettle
of
potatoes
and
then
began
making
toast
nakwisi
made
cocoa
medmangi
fried
bacon
and
hinpoha
flew
about
concocting
a
delicious
compound
which
was
her
own
invention
and
with
which
no
one
dared
to
meddle
the
two
men
watched
with
interest
every
move
of
the
girls
as
they
went
about
preparing
dinner
look
at
that
said
professor
bentley
to
his
friend
that
happened
to
be
hinpoha
who
was
momentarily
left
alone
with
the
fire
the
cocoa
kettle
started
to
sag
as
the
wood
burned
away
and
at
the
same
time
the
mixture
in
the
other
kettle
began
to
boil
over
bracing
the
cocoa
kettle
with
one
foot
she
snatched
the
other
kettle
from
the
fire
and
stood
there
on
one
foot
holding
the
steaming
pot
professor
wheeler
sprang
to
her
assistance
and
propped
up
the
cocoa
kettle
dinner
was
the
merriest
meal
imaginable
and
food
just
faded
away
as
sahwah
declared
hinpoha
won
much
praise
for
her
concoction
which
she
called
slumgullion
it
was
a
sort
of
glorified
tomato
soup
made
with
a
thick
white
sauce
containing
pimentoes
and
eggs
the
mixture
being
served
over
toast
the
clams
of
course
were
the
main
dainty
and
when
dipped
in
butter
slid
down
with
amazing
rapidity
after
dinner
the
girls
threw
themselves
down
in
the
sand
in
various
attitudes
of
relaxation
while
professor
wheeler
his
eyes
straying
again
and
again
toward
hinpoha
told
stories
of
camping
in
the
canadian
rockies
when
he
had
finished
the
girls
rose
and
stretched
themselves
and
then
began
to
clamor
for
more
celebration
nyoda
suggested
a
contest
each
girl
was
to
have
three
minutes
in
which
to
collect
material
and
get
a
fire
started
no
paper
was
allowed
and
only
three
matches
what
a
scramble
there
was
to
find
small
dry
twigs
there
was
a
smart
breeze
blowing
and
most
of
the
matches
went
out
as
soon
as
lighted
putting
their
owners
out
of
the
contest
sahwah
was
wise
and
piled
her
twigs
where
a
huge
stump
sheltered
them
from
the
wind
hinpoha
sat
between
hers
and
the
wind
even
then
it
was
difficult
to
get
the
twigs
to
burn
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
in
league
against
the
contestants
and
firmly
refused
to
light
two
and
a
half
minutes
called
nyoda
warningly
her
watch
in
her
hand
mine
burning
shouted
hinpoha
jumping
up
as
the
flames
began
to
curl
up
from
the
twigs
just
then
a
gust
of
wind
came
up
and
pouf
out
went
the
fire
time
up
called
nyoda
and
sahwah
rose
from
her
knees
disclosing
a
neat
little
blaze
she
had
wisely
sheltered
her
fire
until
the
last
second
giving
it
a
chance
to
kindle
well
now
it
was
the
custom
of
the
winnebagos
to
have
a
folk
story
told
by
one
of
their
number
right
after
supper
but
as
the
visitors
would
have
to
leave
early
nyoda
asked
if
the
girls
would
like
to
tell
the
folk
story
before
supper
they
agreed
as
usual
to
anything
that
would
give
pleasure
to
a
guest
it
was
turn
to
tell
the
story
so
seating
herself
on
a
rock
in
the
midst
of
the
group
she
related
the
story
of
aliquipiso
the
heroic
oneida
maiden
once
upon
a
time
the
savage
mingoes
made
war
upon
the
oneidas
so
the
oneidas
were
obliged
to
flee
from
their
pleasant
village
and
seek
refuge
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
so
well
did
they
hide
their
traces
that
the
mingoes
were
not
able
to
find
their
hiding
place
and
they
remained
safe
their
food
supply
however
began
to
be
exhausted
for
they
were
hemmed
in
by
the
mingoes
and
could
not
break
through
the
lines
they
were
facing
destruction
in
two
ways
either
by
slow
starvation
should
they
remain
in
hiding
or
a
cruel
death
at
the
hands
of
the
mingoes
should
they
venture
out
the
chiefs
and
warriors
of
the
oneidas
held
a
council
but
none
had
a
plan
to
offer
which
would
effect
their
salvation
then
the
maiden
aliquipiso
stepped
forward
with
becoming
modesty
she
addressed
the
chiefs
and
warriors
saying
that
the
great
manitou
had
sent
her
a
dream
in
which
he
showed
her
how
great
boulders
could
be
dashed
on
the
heads
of
the
mingoes
if
they
could
be
lured
to
a
spot
directly
beneath
the
bluff
on
which
the
oneidas
were
hiding
she
went
on
to
say
that
the
great
manitou
had
inspired
her
with
the
desire
to
be
the
means
of
luring
the
mingoes
to
their
destruction
and
she
was
ready
to
start
out
on
her
mission
the
oneida
braves
hailed
her
as
the
saviour
of
her
people
and
the
beloved
of
the
great
spirit
and
hung
strings
of
wampum
around
her
neck
bidding
her
people
farewell
she
left
the
hiding
place
and
was
found
by
the
mingoes
wandering
in
the
forest
apparently
a
lost
maiden
of
the
oneida
tribe
they
took
her
to
their
camp
and
put
her
to
torture
trying
to
make
her
tell
where
her
people
were
hidden
at
last
she
broke
down
and
promised
that
when
night
fell
she
would
lead
the
mingoes
to
the
hiding
place
of
the
oneidas
under
cover
of
the
darkness
she
led
them
to
the
gully
at
the
foot
of
the
ravine
on
each
side
of
her
was
a
mingo
warrior
ready
to
strike
her
dead
at
the
first
cry
for
help
when
she
reached
the
spot
where
she
knew
the
oneidas
were
waiting
to
hurl
immense
boulders
down
over
the
cliff
she
uttered
a
piercing
scream
the
signal
agreed
upon
the
warrior
next
to
her
had
just
time
to
strike
her
dead
with
his
club
when
the
boulders
came
down
crushing
him
and
all
the
mingoes
like
worms
beneath
a
giant
heel
thus
the
oneidas
owed
their
deliverance
to
the
bravery
of
a
maiden
it
must
be
fine
to
be
a
heroine
sighed
sahwah
when
the
applause
was
finished
to
save
a
person
life
or
something
i
wish
i
had
lived
in
the
early
days
of
the
country
nothing
ever
happens
now
unsuspecting
sahwah
little
did
she
dream
what
was
hidden
under
the
wings
of
the
thunder
moon
the
guests
rose
to
depart
after
inspecting
the
tents
and
partaking
of
sandwiches
and
cocoa
out
on
the
sunset
rock
nyoda
took
them
across
the
lake
in
the
the
little
launch
that
belonged
to
camp
both
gentlemen
expressed
their
unbounded
admiration
for
the
physical
prowess
of
the
winnebago
girls
and
remarked
on
their
splendid
ability
to
pull
together
professor
wheeler
raved
about
hinpoha
hair
let
me
come
and
paint
her
he
pleaded
sitting
out
on
the
rocks
with
the
sun
on
that
hair
o
what
a
picture
gently
but
firmly
nyoda
refused
permission
the
girls
have
come
up
here
for
a
summer
all
by
themselves
to
learn
the
joys
of
camping
out
and
of
doing
things
together
such
an
interruption
would
break
up
the
unity
of
their
activities
and
lessen
the
influence
of
camp
professor
wheeler
begged
and
entreated
but
in
vain
nyoda
stood
her
ground
the
most
she
would
promise
to
do
was
to
send
him
hinpoha
address
at
the
close
of
camp
so
that
he
might
take
the
matter
up
with
her
parents
nyoda
returned
home
very
thoughtful
hinpoha
dawning
beauty
was
causing
her
many
thoughtful
moments
of
late
not
that
hinpoha
was
in
the
least
vain
or
on
the
contrary
she
was
the
jolliest
and
most
natural
girl
in
the
group
and
the
least
fastidious
that
same
red
hair
which
professor
wheeler
raved
over
was
the
bane
of
her
existence
and
she
had
more
than
once
threatened
to
cut
it
off
when
the
curls
became
hopelessly
snarled
her
chief
aim
in
life
was
to
have
as
much
fun
as
possible
and
to
get
as
many
others
mixed
up
in
it
as
she
could
hinpoha
haughty
and
proud
because
of
her
good
looks
was
a
picture
that
the
imagination
balked
at
yet
nyoda
could
not
help
noticing
that
wherever
the
group
went
hinpoha
attracted
by
far
the
most
attention
from
outsiders
all
the
way
down
from
cleveland
on
the
train
nyoda
had
watched
men
who
had
scarcely
taken
their
eyes
from
hinpoha
the
guardian
sighed
as
she
reflected
on
the
problem
for
she
knew
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
hinpoha
to
live
out
the
happy
normal
girl
life
which
was
her
birthright
when
nyoda
reached
camp
hinpoha
and
sahwah
were
lying
on
their
stomachs
on
the
dock
rigging
up
a
to
be
sent
over
the
lake
it
consisted
of
a
flat
board
for
a
keel
and
voluminous
sails
dipped
in
turpentine
as
nyoda
landed
they
set
a
match
to
the
sails
and
shoved
the
boat
out
into
the
wind
it
made
a
grand
glare
as
it
glided
out
over
the
lake
and
the
girls
cheered
until
the
last
spark
had
fallen
hissing
into
the
water
was
it
a
grand
success
all
the
way
through
sighed
sahwah
happily
as
they
climbed
the
path
to
the
tents
at
the
sound
of
the
first
bugle
first
we
thought
it
was
going
to
rain
and
then
the
sun
shone
and
first
we
thought
we
were
going
to
have
any
audience
and
then
we
did
anyway
and
the
dinner
did
burn
and
everything
was
lovely
the
day
had
been
pretty
strenuous
for
most
of
the
girls
and
it
was
not
long
before
nepahwin
the
spirit
of
sleep
claimed
them
for
his
own
then
it
was
that
the
dream
manitou
hovering
over
the
omega
tent
fluttered
down
on
sahwah
pillow
in
fancy
she
roamed
through
the
virgin
forest
before
the
white
man
had
come
to
destroy
the
indian
lodges
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
chieftain
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the
other
maidens
now
there
was
a
young
brave
belonging
to
a
neighboring
tribe
with
whom
she
was
in
love
but
there
was
enmity
between
her
tribe
and
his
and
he
dared
not
ask
for
her
hand
so
they
were
in
the
habit
of
meeting
secretly
in
the
forest
one
day
when
they
were
together
they
became
aware
of
footsteps
approaching
and
peering
through
the
bushes
saw
a
number
of
braves
belonging
to
the
young
man
tribe
close
upon
them
so
great
was
their
hatred
of
her
father
that
for
them
to
find
her
would
mean
instant
death
fly
fly
whispered
her
lover
fly
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
jump
for
your
life
my
canoe
is
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
take
it
and
escape
while
i
divert
the
attention
of
these
braves
like
an
arrow
from
the
bow
she
set
out
reaching
the
edge
of
the
cliff
she
poised
for
an
instant
then
leaped
into
the
lake
twenty
feet
below
as
she
struck
the
water
sahwah
woke
up
all
about
her
was
darkness
and
seeming
chaos
there
was
a
swirling
about
her
ears
and
her
limbs
seemed
detached
from
her
body
she
seemed
to
be
rising
rapidly
suddenly
her
head
shot
clear
of
the
enveloping
gloom
and
she
saw
the
moon
and
stars
overhead
just
above
her
reared
a
black
framework
mechanically
she
flung
out
her
hand
and
grasped
solid
wood
the
next
moment
a
voice
rang
out
above
her
head
sahwah
what
are
you
doing
then
a
hand
came
over
the
edge
of
the
dock
and
pulled
her
up
it
was
nyoda
sahwah
blinked
at
her
stupidly
whatever
possessed
you
to
jump
off
the
tower
persisted
nyoda
he
told
me
to
jump
and
i
did
said
sahwah
still
in
a
daze
then
suddenly
her
eyes
fell
on
her
nightdress
dripping
at
every
fold
where
am
i
she
said
sharply
her
teeth
beginning
to
chatter
why
nyoda
laughed
you
dreamed
it
dear
she
said
you
jumped
off
the
tower
in
your
sleep
come
up
to
bed
now
before
you
take
cold
putting
her
arm
around
the
shivering
girl
she
led
her
up
the
path
to
the
tent
and
tucked
her
in
between
dry
blankets
too
much
celebration
she
reflected
and
then
added
to
herself
it
a
good
thing
i
happened
to
see
her
nyoda
had
wakened
in
the
night
and
lay
looking
out
through
the
tent
door
at
the
lake
bathed
in
moonlight
the
diving
tower
was
right
in
her
line
of
vision
solitary
and
black
against
the
moonlight
suddenly
she
became
aware
of
a
figure
climbing
up
the
ladder
to
the
top
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
rubbed
her
eyes
and
recognized
sahwah
the
girl
poised
for
an
instant
on
the
edge
and
then
jumped
into
the
water
nyoda
sped
down
the
path
and
reached
the
dock
just
as
sahwah
came
up
and
up
until
now
thought
nyoda
as
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
i
did
think
they
were
safe
in
their
beds
chapter
iv
in
search
of
adventure
at
the
close
of
singing
hour
one
morning
the
week
following
the
celebration
nyoda
rose
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
requested
the
girls
not
to
make
up
their
beds
as
usual
but
instead
to
roll
their
blankets
in
their
ponchos
and
pile
them
up
together
a
shriek
of
joy
went
up
from
the
girls
what
is
it
nyoda
a
canoe
trip
nyoda
shook
her
head
you
see
was
all
she
would
say
immediately
she
was
surrounded
by
the
girls
clamoring
to
be
told
where
they
were
going
i
surrender
she
said
laughing
at
migwan
who
was
embracing
her
feet
in
supplication
we
going
hunting
hunting
what
clamored
the
chorus
oh
adventures
and
such
things
said
nyoda
in
an
manner
where
are
we
going
how
are
we
going
when
are
we
going
to
start
shouted
the
girls
from
all
sides
nyoda
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
and
tapped
for
silence
with
her
foot
one
at
a
time
please
ladies
and
i
will
endeavor
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
come
into
your
minds
she
said
in
her
best
manner
oh
nyoda
tell
us
begged
the
girls
having
your
kind
permission
to
speak
resumed
nyoda
i
will
try
to
state
the
case
briefly
now
then
one
two
three
going
to
balsam
lake
it
a
hike
shouted
sahwah
turning
a
handspring
is

nyoda
asked
migwan
nyoda
nodded
that
it
we

to
hike
through
the
woods
to
balsam
lake
which
is
a
distance
of
about
twelve
miles
camp

for
the
night
and
return
by
another
route
o

cried
sahwah
hopping
up
and
down
on
one
foot
when
are
we
going
to
start
the
first
two
will
start
at
ten
said
nyoda
the
first
two
echoed
the
girls
are
we
all
going
together
then
nyoda
outlined
her
plan
believing
that
the
girls
would
collect
more
adventures
by
going
in
pairs
instead
of
all
together
besides
the
fun
of
following
a
trail
marked
out
by
leaders
she
had
arranged
the
girls
two
by
two
the
first
pair
who
would
be
the
pathfinders
and
blaze
the
trail
for
those
coming
after
would
leave
at
ten
the
next
pair
twenty
minutes
later
then
the
next
and
so
on
their
ponchos
would
be
brought
in
a
wagon
over
the
main
road
and
left
for
them
they
would
buy
their
supplies
for
supper
and
breakfast
at
the
last
village
they
passed
through
their
lunches
they
would
carry
with
them
the
first
two
were
to
buy
potatoes
and
start
the
fire
and
put
them
in
while
the
rest
would
bring
the
other
supplies
who
and
who
are
going
to
be
partners
demanded
sahwah
listen
while
i
read
the
list
answered
nyoda
sahwah
and
nakwisi
hinpoha
and
migwan
gladys
and
chapa
medmangi
and
myself
you
will
leave
camp
in
the
order
i
have
named
you
sahwah
and
nakwisi
will
be
the
pathfinders
sahwah
seized
nakwisi
around
the
waist
and
the
two
danced
for
joy
who
take
care
of
the
camp
while
we
away
asked
chapa
i
have
arranged
with
a
man
from
the
village
to
look
after
things
until
we
get
back
answered
nyoda
what
are
we
to
carry
with

asked
migwan
you
will
each
carry
a
hatchet
flashlight
notebook
and
pencil
a
camera
a
roll
of
antiseptic
gauze
and
a
roll
of
plaster
sahwah
and
nakwisi
here
is
a
chart
of
the
road
you
are
to
take
and
a
can
of
vermilion
paint
with
which
to
mark
the
trail
take
all
the
pictures
you
can
along
the
road
girls
and
keep
a
list
of
the
birds
animals
trees
and
flowers
that
you
recognize
we
will
compare
them
afterward
and
the
pair
who
has
observed
the
most
will
receive
a
local
honor
hurry
up
you
pathfinders
you
have
only
an
hour
to
get
ready
with
a
wild
scramble
the
girls
made
for
their
tents
to
get
their
ponchos
rolled
and
things
collected
nyoda
had
given
them
a
demonstration
of
poncho
rolling
the
week
before
so
they
all
knew
how
gladys
however
had
to
have
a
good
deal
of
help
from
chapa
before
she
was
ready
to
start
chapa
folded
her
blankets
so
the
poncho
extended
on
all
sides
and
spread
her
nightgown
towel
brush
and
comb
and
toothbrush
crosswise
so
they
would
roll
now
gladys
understood
why
nyoda
had
told
her
especially
to
bring
a
small
pillow
it
was
to
roll
in
the
poncho
when
it
came
to
the
actual
rolling
gladys
had
to
take
a
hand
herself
for
it
takes
two
to
roll
a
poncho
successfully
now
you
tie
it
up
with
a
square
knot
directed
chapa
when
the
roll
had
been
bent
into
a
horseshoe
what
a
square
knot
asked
gladys
why
this
kind
said
chapa
dexterously
tying
one
gladys
tried
several
times
but
failed
to
produce
a
square
knot
o
dear
she
exclaimed
impatiently
i
ca
tie
the
crazy
thing
why
wo
the
other
kind
do
a
granny
knot
always
comes
untied
explained
chapa
here
tie
your
poncho
up
it
getting
late
and
i
want
to
help
make
the
sandwiches
for
the
girls
who
are
starting
first
close
your
tents
before
you
leave
girls
said
nyoda
appearing
in
the
doorway
it
may
rain
while
we
are
away
very
neatly
done
she
said
indicating
gladys
poncho
with
its
smooth
ties
you
are
fast
learning
to
be
a
camper
gladys
said
nothing
about
chapa
having
done
it
up
for
her
and
of
course
chapa
would
not
say
so
promptly
at
ten
the
pathfinders
marched
away
looking
quite
explorerfied
with
their
hatchets
hanging
from
their
belts
and
their
wohelo
knives
chained
to
their
bloomer
pockets
at
intervals
the
other
pairs
started
nyoda
going
the
rounds
before
she
left
to
see
who
had
left
her
things
in
the
neatest
order
and
whose
poncho
looked
the
best
a
banner
would
go
to
the
pair
who
kept
up
the
best
style
throughout
the
hike
she
and
medmangi
ate
their
lunch
before
starting
as
they
left
so
near
noon
leaving
camp
in
the
care
of
the
man
from
the
village
they
struck
into
the
path
through
the
woods
the
whole
earth
seemed
filled
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
invigorating
odor
of
the
pines
here
in
maine
the
wild
strawberries
were
in
full
prime
early
in
july
and
the
path
was
bordered
with
daisies
and
other
bright
flowers
the
two
swung
along
in
silence
with
an
enjoyment
too
deep
for
words
for
they
appreciated
as
only
camp
fire
girls
can
the
beauties
and
wonders
of
nature
back
somewhere
in
the
world
they
had
left
behind
dull
care
might
be
beating
its
incessant
and
the
air
was
full
of
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
but
here
every
harsh
note
was
drowned
in
the
singing
of
birds
is
it
glorious
said
nyoda
fervently
drinking
in
a
long
breath
of
the
air
and
swelling
out
her
already
chest
presently
the
path
they
were
on
was
crossed
by
another
and
at
the
intersection
there
was
a
splash
of
bright
red
paint
on
a
tree
a
blaze
cried
nyoda
stopping
short
which
path
did
they
take
i
wonder
in
the
road
at
the
foot
of
the
blazed
tree
lay
a
small
heap
of
stones
pointing
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
leaders
what
this
asked
nyoda
picking
up
a
small
box
from
beside
the
stones
it
was
marked
for
nyoda
she
lifted
the
lid
and
out
hopped
a
tiny
live
frog
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
was
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
drawn
a
sunfish
so
they
went
on
for
nearly
half
an
hour
following
the
red
blazes
when
suddenly
they
came
upon
chapa
and
gladys
sitting
in
the
road
gladys
had
a
blister
on
her
heel
nyoda
bandaged
it
for
her
and
showed
her
how
to
put
a
piece
of
adhesive
on
the
other
heel
to
keep
it
from
blistering
the
rule
of
the
road
was
that
if
one
pair
caught
up
with
another
they
were
to
sit
down
and
give
them
a
ten
minutes
start
so
nyoda
and
medmangi
sat
down
and
waited
until
gladys
and
chapa
were
well
under
way
the
next
blaze
they
struck
was
truly
startling
it
was
a
little
silver
birch
tree
with
the
stem
painted
entirely
red
nailed
to
it
with
a
big
rusty
nail
was
a
piece
of
cardboard
at
the
top
was
written
sahwah
and
the
starlore
maiden
keep
ahead
though
heavy
laden
then
followed
a
symbol
and
the
words
see
our
combination
symbol
it
a
starfish
underneath
was
a
couplet
in
a
different
writing
here
come
migwan
and
hinpoha
two
and
two
like
the
beasts
of
noah
underneath
that
was
a
verse
signed
by
the
chipmunk
gladys
heel
is
full
of
plaster
or
else
we
would
travel
faster
nyoda
and
medmangi
shouted
and
took
the
card
along
for
a
souvenir
adding
the
lines
here
nyoda
and
medmangi
read
the
blaze
and
held
a
tangi
a
little
farther
on
they
discovered
the
legend
here
we
sit
down
in
the
road
for
sahwah
stocking
must
be
sewed
what
the
matter
grumpy
said
migwan
to
hinpoha
who
had
been
stewing
around
to
herself
for
the
last
ten
minutes
it
this
old
orange
i
brought
along
for
lunch
burst
out
hinpoha
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
if
i
put
it
in
my
bloomers
it
bangs
against
my
leg
and
if
i
carry
it
in
my
bag
it
bangs
against
my
stomach
and
if
i
carry
it
in
my
hand
i
drop
it
every
other
minute
it
driving
me
crazy
why
do
you
eat
it
asked
migwan
simply
why
i
never
thought
of
that
exclaimed
hinpoha
and
soon
had
the
offending
orange
safely
disposed
of
lunch
time
found
sahwah
and
nakwisi
close
to
a
farm
house
and
they
went
in
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
the
farmer
wife
looked
curiously
at
the
two
girls
in
bloomers
carrying
a
can
of
red
paint
sahwah
introduced
nakwisi
and
herself
and
explained
what
they
were
doing
land
sakes
alive
exclaimed
the
wife
what
girls
do
do
nowadays
livin
like
indians
and
walkin
their
legs
off
just
for
the
fun
of
it
come
right
in
and
i
see
if
i
ca
find
something
better
than
water
to
give
you
she
bustled
out
into
the
summer
kitchen
and
returned
with
a
pitcher
of
milk
and
two
glasses
here
drink
this
along
with
your
sandwiches
and
try
a
dish
of
berries
sahwah
and
nakwisi
needed
no
second
invitation
their
sandwiches
had
been
pretty
well
baked
in
the
sun
for
the
last
two
hours
and
were
as
dry
as
straw
so
the
milk
and
berries
were
decidedly
refreshing
how
restful
it
is
here
sighed
sahwah
luxuriously
leaning
back
in
the
cushioned
rocking
chair
ca
you
stay
a
spell
girls
and
rest
up
said
their
hostess
cordially
we
have
half
an
hour
for
our
noonday
rest
said
sahwah
and
i
like
to
take
it
right
in
this
chair
if
you
do
mind
she
slipped
off
her
shoes
and
stretched
her
feet
to
rest
them
closing
her
eyes
meanwhile
and
nakwisi
followed
suit
when
they
finally
rose
to
go
the
farmer
wife
brought
out
a
plate
of
cookies
which
she
urged
them
to
take
along
to
eat
on
the
road
she
stood
looking
after
them
for
a
long
time
as
they
trudged
along
in
the
yellow
dust
i
wish
i
could
go
along
with
over
the
hills
she
exclaimed
suddenly
to
the
unheeding
hens
that
were
walking
up
and
down
the
steps
i
tired
of
staying
at
home
and
doing
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
i
wish
i
could
go
along
too
chapa
and
gladys
following
the
blazes
through
the
woods
found
their
path
barred
at
one
place
by
a
rather
wide
brook
the
trail
was
marked
again
on
the
other
side
how
are
we
going
to
get
across
asked
gladys
wade
through
said
chapa
briefly
sitting
down
and
commencing
to
pull
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
gladys
put
her
hand
into
the
water
and
shook
her
head
it
too
cold
she
said
drawing
back
no
it
is
said
chapa
the
rest
went
through
it
come
on
you
be
all
right
stuffing
her
stockings
into
her
shoes
she
threw
them
to
the
farther
bank
and
then
stepping
into
the
swift
little
stream
she
waded
across
calmly
gladys
hesitated
for
several
minutes
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
put
her
feet
in
the
water
but
finally
encouraged
by
chapa
she
stepped
gingerly
in
be
careful
of
the
rocks
they
slippery
warned
chapa
but
the
warning
was
hardly
out
of
her
mouth
when
gladys
slipped
on
one
of
the
smooth
stones
and
sat
down
with
a
mighty
splash
chapa
flew
to
the
rescue
and
pulled
her
out
on
the
bank
what
will
i
do
wailed
gladys
i
ca
go
on
with
these
wet
bloomers
wear
my
bathing
suit
suggested
chapa
untying
it
from
around
her
waist
where
she
had
been
wearing
it
as
a
sort
of
sash
with
all
her
impedimenta
stuck
into
the
folds
so
gladys
changed
to
the
bathing
suit
and
chapa
fixed
the
wet
bloomers
on
a
stick
which
they
could
carry
between
them
so
they
would
be
dry
by
the
time
they
reached
the
night
encampment
we
ought
to
be
pretty
near
the
end
of
our
journey
said
nyoda
to
medmangi
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
have
you
caught
sight
of
balsam
lake
yet
medmangi
shook
her
head
the
woods
are
too
thick
to
see
anything
through
she
answered
let
call
said
nyoda
together
they
raised
their
hands
to
their
mouths
and
sent
out
the
long
yodling
call
of
the
camp
fire
girls
and
then
stood
silent
listening
before
the
echoes
had
ceased
coming
out
of
the
woods
the
call
was
answered
from
somewhere
beyond
the
trees
nearly
there
said
nyoda
and
they
quickened
their
pace
as
they
went
through
the
last
strip
of
woods
soon
they
heard
voices
and
saw
figures
moving
about
in
the
distance
and
presently
they
came
upon
the
rest
of
the
girls
on
the
shore
of
the
tiny
lake
some
of
the
girls
were
lying
at
full
length
on
the
soft
ground
others
were
preparing
supper
hinpoha
was
chopping
wood
with
her
hatchet
sahwah
was
shaving
chocolate
with
hers
the
fire
was
built
close
to
the
water
edge
and
the
firelight
shone
out
redly
across
the
water
migwan
set
a
can
of
beans
in
the
embers
to
warm
then
she
sat
down
on
the
beach
to
enjoy
the
view
the
late
afternoon
sun
was
pouring
its
full
glory
on
the
lake
making
its
surface
one
dazzling
sheet
of
light
migwan
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
drank
in
the
splendor
of
the
scene
with
all
her
soul
now
i
know
how
scott
felt
when
he
wrote
one
burnished
sheet
of
living
gold
loch
katrine
lay
beneath
him
rolled
mused
migwan
and
fell
to
dreaming
dreams
as
golden
as
the
setting
sun
around
the
fire
the
tongues
were
wagging
merrily
we
met
a
man
with
a
wagon
and
he
said
in
and
we
said
thank
you
and
he
said
do
then
ding
it
we
ate
our
lunch
beside
a
brook
and
migwan
dropped
her
sandwiches
in
and
had
bread
soup
we
met
a
bull
and
hinpoha
climbed
the
fence
into
a
field
and
there
were
two
bulls
in
that
field
nyoda
sat
down
in
a
potato
patch
to
tie
her
shoe
and
the
farmer
came
out
and
yelled
bang
there
was
a
terrific
explosion
that
scattered
the
firebrands
among
the
girls
and
showered
them
with
ashes
and
fragments
of
potatoes
they
sprang
to
their
feet
extinguishing
the
fires
that
started
in
various
places
and
asking
what
had
happened
nyoda
glance
happened
to
fall
on
hinpoha
who
had
sat
nearest
the
fire
the
whole
front
of
her
middy
was
plastered
with
on
the
ground
by
the
fire
lay
the
flattened
remains
of
a
tin
can
migwan
had
put
the
beans
to
heat
without
opening
the
can
shrieks
of
laughter
arose
when
the
truth
dawned
on
the
girls
and
it
was
many
a
day
before
they
left
off
teasing
migwan
about
it
the
fire
was
built
up
again
bacon
frizzled
and
toast
and
cocoa
made
and
my
mouth
was
just
watering
for
baked
potatoes
wailed
hinpoha
and
mine
for
baked
beans
echoed
sahwah
you
should
eat
potatoes
if
you
want
to
get
thin
said
migwan
should
i
nyoda
asked
hinpoha
appealing
to
her
guardian
nyoda
pursed
up
her
lips
and
recited
with
a
judicial
air
if
you
would
slimmer
grow
my
daughter
eat
no
starches
drink
no
water
sahwah
then
took
up
the
tale
look
not
on
the
candy
sweet
fall
not
for
the
fat
of
meat
thus
it
went
round
the
circle
each
girl
pointing
her
finger
at
hinpoha
and
reciting
a
couplet
if
your
fat
you
wear
away
exercise
ten
hours
a
day
if
you
would
grow
thin
and
graceful
eat
of
lemons
this
whole
caseful
if
you
think
that
you
too
large
swim
ahead
and
tow
the
barge
if
you
really
would
grow
small
do
eat
anything
at
all
i
think
you
mean
said
hinpoha
wiping
away
mock
tears
immediately
all
the
girls
flung
themselves
on
her
hugging
and
caressing
her
never
mind
they
comforted
we
love
you
anyhow
we
could
live
without
you
did
anybody
catch
up
with
anybody
else
today
asked
sahwah
nyoda
and
medmangi
sprang
to
their
feet
and
pointing
scornfully
at
chapa
and
gladys
sang
to
the
tune
of
forsaken
were
they
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
they
sat
plain
as
day
we
sat
down
beside
them
and
sang
them
this
song
which
caused
them
to
rise
up
and
travel
along
we
made
a
song
too
cried
migwan
and
hinpoha
springing
to
their
feet
it
to
the
tune
of
bells
and
keeping
time
with
their
feet
they
sang
marching
through
the
woods
onward
day
by
day
round
the
lake
we
go
singing
all
the
way
packs
strapped
to
our
backs
there
our
eats
we
stow
oh
what
fun
it
is
to
hike
with
the
girls
of
wohelo
wohelo
wohelo
singing
all
the
day
o
what
fun
it
is
to
hike
around
the
world
away
the
girls
joined
in
the
chorus
and
then
went
back
to
the
beginning
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
song
had
been
adopted
for
use
by
this
time
the
fire
was
burning
low
and
nyoda
reminded
the
girls
that
they
had
walked
twelve
miles
that
day
and
had
a
still
longer
tramp
ahead
on
the
morrow
it
does
seem
possible
that
i
walked
so
far
today
said
migwan
sitting
up
and
stretching
i
not
nearly
as
tired
as
i
have
been
some
days
last
winter
after
school
the
girls
had
all
picked
out
their
sleeping
places
before
dark
and
made
up
their
beds
on
the
ground
before
retiring
they
all
took
a
dip
in
the
lake
splashing
around
in
the
darkness
and
barking
their
shins
on
the
rocks
gladys
and
chapa
sought
their
beds
first
it
was
the
first
time
that
gladys
had
ever
slept
on
the
ground
there
a
rock
in
my
back
and
my
feet
are
higher
than
my
head
she
wailed
then
let
move
said
chapa
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
she
picked
up
the
bed
and
deposited
it
in
another
place
this
was
fairly
comfortable
and
they
subsided
next
an
uproar
arose
from
a
bed
near
the
beach
there
a
million
ants
in
my
bed
shrieked
migwan
jumping
up
and
shaking
her
blankets
she
had
spread
her
bed
on
a
colony
of
ant
hills
and
the
ants
had
improved
the
shining
hours
until
bedtime
by
crawling
between
the
blankets
sahwah
was
the
last
in
bed
having
stayed
in
the
water
longer
than
the
others
she
was
strangely
wakeful
and
lay
for
a
long
time
staring
up
at
the
pines
towering
above
her
that
seemed
to
rise
hundreds
of
feet
before
a
branch
appeared
she
amused
herself
by
reaching
out
her
hand
and
identifying
her
belongings
which
hung
on
a
bush
at
her
head
her
hand
closed
over
the
can
of
red
paint
like
lightning
she
had
an
inspiration
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
the
next
bed
it
migwan
she
said
to
herself
grasping
the
paint
brush
she
reached
over
and
daubed
the
face
of
the
sleeper
then
she
settled
down
and
slept
gladys
woke
up
in
the
gray
dawn
and
looked
out
from
her
sandwich
bed
the
lake
was
completely
hidden
by
a
thick
mist
drops
were
coming
down
patter
patter
on
her
poncho
chapa
she
whispered
excitedly
to
her
partner
it
raining
well
what
of
it
answered
chapa
without
opening
her
eyes
and
pulling
the
poncho
over
their
heads
she
resumed
her
slumbers
gladys
drew
a
horrified
breath
at
the
idea
of
sleeping
on
the
ground
in
the
rain
but
the
cozy
dryness
of
her
bed
soon
wooed
her
back
to
slumber
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
the
sun
was
rising
over
the
lake
no
there
were
two
suns
one
in
the
lake
which
was
making
it
boil
and
send
up
clouds
of
steam
and
another
in
the
sky
which
was
drawing
up
the
vapor
soon
the
bugle
blew
and
the
camp
woke
to
activity
with
a
whoop
the
girls
made
for
the
lake
for
their
morning
plunge
gladys
said
nyoda
what
is
the
matter
with
your
face
on
each
cheek
as
well
as
on
her
nose
and
forehead
there
was
a
daub
of
red
sahwah
stared
then
she
giggled
i
thought
it
was
migwan
beside
me
she
explained
excuse
me
gladys
i
did
mean
to
decorate
you
gladys
however
evidently
thought
differently
for
she
was
decidedly
cool
to
sahwah
from
then
on
just
before
breakfast
the
girls
assembled
on
the
high
cliff
to
sing
the
morning
song
their
choice
was
rousseau
beautiful
hymn
when
the
mists
have
rolled
in
splendor
from
the
beauty
of
the
hills
the
mist
curtains
were
rolling
up
from
the
lake
in
the
morning
sun
disclosing
the
lofty
brow
of
mount
washington
in
the
distance
and
the
girls
felt
very
near
to
god
and
nature
as
they
sang
the
inspired
words
breakfast
was
cooked
in
the
open
and
consisted
of
fruit
pancakes
and
cocoa
hinpoha
heroically
passed
up
both
the
pancakes
and
the
cocoa
and
contented
herself
with
one
piece
of
dry
toast
the
hike
proceeded
in
order
just
as
on
the
previous
day
right
after
breakfast
the
ponchos
were
rolled
and
the
pathfinders
struck
the
trail
through
the
woods
the
first
note
left
by
them
read
first
rest
the
pest
wonder
what
they
meant
by
that
said
hinpoha
to
migwan
they
soon
found
out
at
the
last
blaze
the
path
dipped
into
dense
woods
from
all
sides
rose
a
cloud
of
mosquitoes
which
settled
on
every
exposed
portion
of
their
persons
and
stung
viciously
ooo
wow
they
cried
breaking
into
a
run
and
brushing
the
mosquitoes
off
with
branches
before
they
entered
the
next
woods
they
stripped
the
bark
off
a
fallen
birch
log
and
made
leggings
of
it
tying
them
on
with
their
handkerchiefs
migwan
made
up
a
song
as
they
went
along
and
taught
it
to
hinpoha
the
tune
was
solomon
levi
oh
we
are
winnebagos
and
our
color
is
the
red
over
the
hills
and
down
the
dales
we
go
wherever
we
led
we
follow
the
blazes
through
the
wood
like
hounds
upon
the
hunt
we
keep
our
feet
upon
the
path
and
our
faces
to
the
front
oh
winnebagos
tra
la
la
la
oh
winnebagos
tra
la
la
la
la
la
la
oh
we
are
winnebagos
and
our
color
is
the
red
over
the
hills
and
down
the
dales
we
go
wherever
we
led
i
suppose
you
be
a
great
poet
when
you
grow
up
said
hinpoha
stooping
to
pick
a
cluster
of
ripe
strawberries
migwan
sighed
no
i
never
be
a
great
poet
she
answered
but
i
may
be
able
to
write
stories
in
time
if
i
learn
enough
about
composition
what
college
are
you
going
to
asked
hinpoha
i
not
going
at
all
said
migwan
seriously
you
know
since
father
died
we
have
had
to
live
very
carefully
and
high
school
is
all
mother
can
do
for
me
i
have
to
go
to
work
as
soon
as
i
graduate
it
too
bad
sympathized
hinpoha
you
ought
to
go
to
college
more
than
any
of
us
here
am
i
with
no
more
brains
than
a
rabbit
going
to
smith
it
is
fair
ca
you
work
your
way
through
and
go
anyhow
migwan
shook
her
head
you
see
we
will
need
the
money
i
earn
to
send
betty
and
tom
to
high
school
thus
talking
earnestly
they
followed
the
blazes
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
path
divided
around
a
very
dense
piece
of
woods
you
take
one
path
and
i
take
the
other
said
migwan
and
we
see
who
comes
out
first
they
separated
and
migwan
plunged
into
the
darker
of
the
two
paths
it
was
hard
breaking
through
small
scrub
pines
closed
over
the
path
their
branches
intertwined
so
that
more
than
once
she
had
to
use
her
hatchet
roots
and
vines
tangled
her
feet
and
made
her
stumble
then
she
wedged
her
foot
in
between
two
stumps
and
could
not
get
it
out
she
pulled
and
twisted
and
finally
grasped
hold
of
the
stem
of
a
small
tree
and
braced
herself
firmly
while
she
endeavored
to
free
herself
with
a
sudden
jerk
her
foot
came
free
and
at
the
same
instant
the
tree
came
up
by
the
roots
the
ground
caved
in
beneath
it
and
migwan
began
to
fall
she
now
discovered
what
she
had
not
noticed
before
that
the
path
was
on
the
edge
of
a
very
deep
ravine
which
was
hidden
by
the
thick
bushes
straight
down
she
rolled
for
about
fifty
feet
vainly
trying
to
stop
herself
by
grasping
the
small
bushes
deep
down
in
the
gully
she
came
to
a
stop
not
two
feet
away
from
a
small
stream
i
not
dead
anyhow
was
her
first
thought
as
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
a
stab
of
agony
went
through
her
left
knee
and
she
sank
down
again
white
and
faint
dislocated
she
said
to
herself
after
inspecting
the
injured
member
let
see
if
i
can
put
it
back
migwan
had
had
work
and
had
learned
to
set
dislocations
so
she
slipped
the
joint
back
into
place
before
it
could
get
a
chance
to
swell
and
bound
it
fast
with
a
strip
of
the
bandage
the
girls
always
carried
with
them
at
that
the
pain
made
her
sick
to
her
stomach
and
she
lay
back
her
head
reeling
when
she
could
see
clearly
again
she
sat
up
and
looked
around
it
was
nearly
dark
as
the
thick
pines
shut
out
the
declining
rays
of
the
sun
she
called
aloud
till
the
echoes
rang
but
there
was
no
answering
call
the
gravity
of
the
situation
came
home
to
her
but
migwan
was
not
one
to
whimper
she
had
nothing
with
her
to
eat
but
there
was
clear
water
at
hand
and
she
drank
and
bathed
her
scratched
face
and
hands
then
she
lay
still
and
thought
things
out
they
surely
find
me
sometime
she
reflected
for
hinpoha
knows
which
path
i
took
the
will
tell
the
tale
there
nothing
in
the
woods
to
hurt
me
either
man
or
beast
my
knee
is
back
in
joint
and
will
begin
to
heal
while
i
stay
here
things
might
have
been
worse
beside
her
lay
a
dry
pine
tree
and
she
chopped
it
up
and
built
a
fire
for
a
long
time
she
lay
looking
up
at
the
great
pines
above
her
lost
in
romantic
fancies
her
beautiful
expressive
eyes
shining
in
the
firelight
by
and
by
she
slept
her
head
pillowed
on
her
sweater
she
was
aroused
by
the
squalling
of
the
jays
in
the
pine
trees
sunlight
was
filtering
down
through
the
branches
she
felt
chilly
from
her
sleep
on
the
ground
although
the
trees
had
kept
the
dew
from
her
sitting
up
she
exercised
her
arms
to
get
up
the
circulation
then
leaning
on
a
heavy
stick
and
hobbling
on
one
foot
she
began
to
look
about
her
not
far
from
where
she
had
fallen
there
was
an
opening
in
the
undergrowth
and
through
this
migwan
could
see
another
path
about
six
feet
lower
down
the
slope
i
wonder
if
they
would
come
this
way
thought
migwan
i
had
better
put
a
blaze
in
the
road
so
they
can
find
me
she
was
casting
about
for
something
that
would
attract
the
attention
of
the
searchers
when
she
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
path
they
coming
she
thought
and
was
just
ready
to
fall
on
hinpoha
neck
when
out
of
the
woods
came
two
men
one
of
them
carrying
a
little
boy
a
few
paces
from
where
migwan
stood
hidden
by
a
large
tree
trunk
they
came
to
a
halt
and
the
one
man
pulling
out
a
purse
began
to
count
money
the
little
boy
was
dressed
in
a
white
sailor
suit
and
hat
and
his
hair
under
the
hat
brim
was
yellow
and
curly
a
beam
of
sunlight
fell
directly
on
him
making
such
a
pretty
picture
that
migwan
could
not
help
him
her
camera
still
hung
around
her
neck
in
its
case
having
luckily
escaped
injury
by
her
fall
then
she
stepped
out
and
called
to
the
men
both
started
violently
migwan
hastened
to
explain
her
plight
sorry
we
ca
carry
you
along
said
the
man
with
the
purse
but
we
have
to
catch
the
boat
at
the
lake
and
that
would
make
us
miss
it
ca
you
tell
someone
where
i
am
asked
migwan
why
yes
yes
answered
the
man
pulling
out
his
watch
send
some
one
for
you
they
disappeared
down
the
path
at
a
quick
pace
and
migwan
sat
down
by
the
opening
and
waited
hinpoha
following
the
path
taken
by
the
leaders
was
tripping
blithely
along
not
looking
where
she
was
going
with
the
result
that
she
ran
into
a
pine
branch
which
caught
her
long
hair
and
in
freeing
herself
broke
the
chain
of
her
locket
which
slipped
to
the
ground
and
hid
among
the
leaves
hinpoha
got
down
on
her
knees
and
hunted
for
it
the
minutes
passed
but
still
she
did
not
find
it
she
did
not
worry
about
migwan
because
she
knew
she
would
wait
where
the
paths
met
chapa
and
gladys
caught
up
and
helped
her
search
and
finally
they
found
it
upon
reaching
the
main
path
however
they
did
not
see
migwan
probably
got
tired
waiting
and
went
on
by
herself
said
hinpoha
serves
me
right
and
she
walked
on
with
gladys
and
chapa
two
hours
later
they
reached
camp
and
hinpoha
began
calling
around
for
migwan
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
are
you
sure
she
is
hiding
about
the
camp
to
surprise
us
asked
hinpoha
hopefully
sahwah
seized
the
bugle
and
blew
the
call
which
meant
come
at
once
no
matter
what
you
are
doing
but
there
was
no
answer
thoroughly
frightened
they
started
back
on
the
trail
meeting
nyoda
and
medmangi
just
coming
in
at
the
story
of
migwan
disappearance
nyoda
immediately
planned
a
search
but
first
of
all
she
insisted
on
the
girls
eating
their
supper
then
she
reminded
them
that
they
had
walked
fifteen
miles
that
day
and
most
of
them
needed
rest
hinpoha
stoutly
maintained
that
she
was
as
fresh
as
a
may
morning
and
declared
she
would
walk
all
night
to
find
migwan
what
if
she
never
comes
back
she
wailed
her
knees
gave
way
under
her
at
the
thought
and
she
sank
down
at
nyoda
feet
her
head
on
her
arms
of
course
she
come
back
said
nyoda
confidently
but
her
heart
was
like
water
within
her
these
girls
were
all
in
her
charge
for
the
summer
and
she
was
responsible
for
their
welfare
what
had
become
of
migwan
the
party
that
finally
started
out
were
nyoda
hinpoha
sahwah
and
the
man
who
had
watched
the
camp
while
the
girls
were
away
who
drove
his
wagon
along
the
roadway
and
let
the
girls
ride
in
turn
they
explored
the
woods
back
to
where
the
two
paths
emerged
from
the
thicket
calling
and
searching
with
lanterns
all
to
no
purpose
they
went
over
every
inch
of
the
path
down
which
migwan
had
disappeared
now
migwan
in
coming
through
had
strayed
off
the
path
which
was
very
hard
to
follow
and
the
place
where
she
had
gone
over
the
edge
was
at
least
twenty
feet
from
the
true
path
the
searchers
therefore
did
not
find
the
evidence
of
her
fall
and
as
the
time
when
they
stood
there
and
called
to
her
corresponded
with
the
time
when
migwan
lay
in
a
dead
faint
she
made
no
response
and
they
passed
on
the
night
wore
on
and
the
searchers
grew
more
and
more
alarmed
hinpoha
dissolved
in
tears
and
declared
she
just
could
live
without
migwan
nyoda
tried
to
comfort
her
with
all
sorts
of
cheering
possibilities
but
her
own
heart
was
troubled
and
anxious
they
retraced
their
route
back
to
the
place
where
they
had
camped
the
night
before
but
found
nothing
then
discouraged
and
they
began
to
retrace
their
steps
to
camp
morning
light
brought
a
new
disclosure
not
only
had
they
lost
migwan
somewhere
in
the
great
woods
but
they
themselves
were
completely
off
the
trail
of
the
day
before
at
one
of
the
dim
they
had
made
a
misturn
and
were
now
wandering
around
without
the
slightest
notion
of
where
they
were
going
well
i
be
jiggered
said
the
man
with
the
wagon
i
thought
i
knew
these
here
woods
pretty
well
but
i
blamed
if
i
know
where
we
are
now
everything
looks
turned
around
i
swear
now
that
that
was
the
west
over
there
yet
there
is
the
sun
as
big
as
life
i
plumb
addled
they
advanced
uncertainly
looking
closely
for
the
trees
of
the
hike
this
road
looks
as
if
it
went
somewhere
said
hinpoha
they
stuck
to
the
road
for
a
while
but
soon
saw
a
sign
board
reading
cambridge
miles
cambridge
was
a
town
lying
exactly
in
the
opposite
direction
from
loon
lake
bewildered
they
turned
back
and
hinpoha
left
the
main
road
and
followed
a
narrow
path
that
led
into
the
woods
wearily
nyoda
walked
after
her
she
was
at
her
wits
end
it
no
use
hinpoha
she
said
sadly
this
path
is
any
better
than
the
road
we
never
went
through
this
gully
on
the
hike
still
it
might
lead
to
one
we
know
answered
hinpoha
and
they
kept
on
the
path
seemed
endless
and
was
hard
to
walk
in
for
it
was
on
the
side
of
a
hill
let
turn
back
pleaded
nyoda
we
only
wasting
our
strength
without
getting
anywhere
maybe
we
had
better
answered
hinpoha
in
a
discouraged
tone
just
then
the
path
turned
sharply
and
as
they
rounded
the
corner
they
came
upon
a
figure
sitting
in
the
long
grass
migwan
cried
nyoda
and
stood
as
if
petrified
hinpoha
pointed
her
finger
and
tried
to
sing
but
burst
into
tears
instead
and
fell
on
migwan
neck
explanations
were
soon
made
and
migwan
was
carried
to
the
wagon
to
be
petted
and
fussed
over
as
if
she
had
been
lost
for
a
year
so
wearied
but
triumphant
the
hunting
party
returned
to
camp
with
the
trophy
of
the
chase
chapter
in
which
a
film
tells
a
tale
it
was
the
end
of
the
swimming
period
and
nyoda
was
thoroughly
exhausted
she
had
been
giving
gladys
her
first
swimming
lesson
it
had
taken
a
week
to
coax
the
girl
into
the
water
at
all
and
nearly
another
one
to
get
her
in
over
her
knees
she
showed
a
perfectly
unreasoning
terror
of
the
water
in
vain
did
sahwah
dive
off
the
tower
and
come
up
safe
and
sound
in
vain
did
hinpoha
demonstrate
how
impossible
it
was
to
sink
if
you
relaxed
gladys
doubled
up
in
a
tense
knot
and
grew
sick
with
fear
regardless
of
nyoda
supporting
hand
finally
nyoda
took
her
farther
up
the
beach
away
from
the
other
girls
now
gladys
she
said
reassuringly
do
you
believe
down
deep
in
your
heart
that
i
would
let
go
of
you
and
let
you
drown
no
said
gladys
then
said
nyoda
you
come
along
and
let
me
hold
you
up
while
you
float
gladys
swallowed
hard
and
stiffened
out
like
a
crowbar
then
as
a
wavelet
washed
over
her
face
she
clutched
wildly
at
nyoda
and
put
her
feet
on
solid
bottom
and
so
she
went
on
with
inexhaustible
patience
nyoda
tried
again
and
again
to
get
her
to
lie
out
flat
on
the
water
but
was
compelled
to
admit
at
the
end
of
the
hour
that
she
had
made
no
progress
whatever
for
gladys
had
not
made
the
slightest
effort
to
control
either
her
muscles
or
her
fears
nyoda
sympathized
with
her
great
fear
of
the
water
for
she
realized
that
it
was
a
very
real
thing
but
she
was
disappointed
that
she
had
not
tried
to
conquer
it
her
first
impression
of
gladys
bad
been
borne
out
by
later
events
she
was
vain
and
silly
and
shallow
she
lacked
the
good
sportsmanship
which
made
the
rest
of
the
winnebagos
such
successful
campers
of
team
work
she
had
no
idea
at
all
she
wanted
to
order
her
day
to
suit
herself
and
put
on
an
injured
air
if
one
of
the
girls
declined
to
help
her
make
a
stencil
when
it
was
time
to
clean
up
the
tent
for
inspection
her
corner
of
the
tent
was
never
in
order
and
as
a
result
the
omegas
were
getting
low
marks
in
inspection
much
to
their
disgust
for
the
rivalry
between
the
two
tents
was
very
keen
gladys
had
officially
joined
the
winnebagos
having
come
into
the
group
at
the
last
council
fire
as
kamama
the
butterfly
the
very
name
she
chose
was
an
illustration
of
her
character
she
had
no
higher
ambition
than
to
be
a
society
butterfly
nyoda
sighed
but
she
knew
gladys
was
not
to
blame
for
she
had
been
brought
up
in
an
artificial
atmosphere
of
fashion
and
snobbery
nyoda
saw
at
once
that
in
order
to
get
the
most
good
out
of
camp
gladys
must
be
on
the
same
basis
as
the
other
girls
so
she
defined
their
relative
positions
clearly
at
the
beginning
gladys
father
owned
the
camp
so
they
were
in
a
measure
her
guests
therefore
nyoda
would
not
let
her
pay
a
share
of
the
provisions
thus
evening
things
up
gladys
had
now
been
in
camp
nearly
two
weeks
but
she
had
not
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
life
as
the
others
had
and
it
was
not
because
they
had
left
her
out
of
things
every
girl
had
gone
out
of
her
way
to
make
her
feel
at
home
the
fault
was
clearly
gladys
own
nyoda
was
thinking
about
all
these
things
when
her
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
an
automobile
horn
and
in
a
few
moments
a
man
came
down
the
path
from
the
road
he
approached
her
and
introduced
himself
as
bailey
he
was
a
private
detective
he
said
and
was
trying
to
locate
a
child
that
had
strayed
or
been
kidnapped
from
a
family
on
the
other
end
of
the
lake
he
was
visiting
all
the
camps
to
see
if
any
one
had
seen
the
child
nyoda
shook
her
head
we
have
seen
any
child
around
here
she
said
was
it
a
girl
or
a
boy
a
boy
answered
bailey
three
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
disappearance
he
wore
a
white
sailor
suit
and
hat
when
did
he
disappear
asked
nyoda
last
thursday
night
we
were
just
coming
home
from
a
hiking
trip
then
and
had
lost
one
of
our
own
girls
and
were
paying
much
attention
to
anything
else
said
nyoda
but
i
ask
the
girls
who
were
in
camp
while
we
were
looking
for
migwan
she
blew
the
bugle
and
called
the
girls
together
and
when
they
had
come
she
introduced
bailey
and
asked
if
they
had
seen
anything
of
the
little
boy
at
the
mention
of
a
boy
in
a
white
sailor
suit
migwan
pricked
up
her
ears
why
i
saw
him
when
i
was
lying
in
the
woods
waiting
for
the
girls
to
come
for
me
there
were
two
men
with
him
one
carrying
him
i
spoke
to
them
and
asked
them
to
send
somebody
after
me
they
said
they
were
hurrying
to
catch
the
boat
what
boat
asked
the
detective
it
must
have
been
the
the
loon
lake
boat
for
they
were
going
in
the
direction
of
loon
lake
can
you
describe
the
men
asked
bailey
migwan
tilted
back
her
head
and
squinted
her
eyes
in
an
effort
to
bring
back
the
picture
one
was
tall
and
had
a
black
mustache
he
was
the
one
who
carried
the
boy
the
other
was
shorter
and
she
said
could
you
swear
to
that
description
asked
the
detective
migwan
suddenly
clapped
her
hands
i
can
do
better
than
that
she
said
i
can
show
a
picture
of
them
the
little
boy
looked
so
cute
i
snapped
them
you
have
this
picture
said
the
detective
eagerly
the
film
is
developed
yet
answered
migwan
how
soon
can
you
have
it
developed
asked
bailey
we
do
it
right
away
said
nyoda
we
have
a
dark
room
rigged
up
nyoda
took
every
precaution
to
guard
against
spoiling
the
film
and
hinpoha
who
was
in
the
dark
room
with
her
hardly
dared
breathe
for
fear
of
working
some
harm
what
an
exciting
moment
it
was
when
the
figures
finally
stood
out
plainly
on
the
film
the
girls
crowded
around
the
detective
as
he
held
the
picture
to
the
light
there
were
the
two
men
and
the
little
boy
just
as
migwan
had
described
them
what
will
you
take
for
this
film
asked
the
detective
take
for
it
said
migwan
you
perfectly
welcome
to
it
i
only
too
glad
to
help
if
the
picture
will
be
of
any
benefit
migwan
a
heroine
sighed
sahwah
after
the
detective
had
departed
i
wish
i
had
a
chance
to
do
something
big
and
noble
the
only
time
i
can
be
heroic
is
in
my
sleep
and
then
i
make
myself
ridiculous
cheer
up
sahwah
said
hinpoha
i
ca
even
be
heroic
in
my
sleep
come
on
i
beat
you
a
game
of
tennis
and
off
went
the
two
cronies
arm
in
arm
gladys
came
and
sat
beside
migwan
who
was
spending
her
convalescent
days
in
a
steamer
chair
on
the
porch
of
the
shack
where
she
could
watch
the
girls
in
the
lake
and
be
with
them
during
craft
hour
nyoda
had
summoned
a
doctor
from
the
village
who
proclaimed
migwan
dislocation
a
slight
one
and
her
prompt
setting
of
it
a
good
thing
and
promised
that
in
a
few
weeks
it
would
be
as
good
as
ever
meanwhile
however
she
had
to
keep
off
her
feet
and
the
enforced
rest
bothered
her
more
than
the
pain
did
at
first
she
read
a
good
deal
however
and
did
much
craft
work
and
the
days
went
by
somehow
what
are
you
doing
asked
gladys
making
a
woodblock
said
migwan
what
it
for
why
you
cut
a
design
in
the
wood
explained
migwan
and
then
use
it
to
stamp
things
with
either
scarfs
or
table
covers
or
this
is
for
a
what
a
asked
gladys
it
a
thin
sheet
of
paper
stamped
with
a
design
bearing
your
name
you
paste
it
in
the
front
of
your
books
see
my
design
the
tall
pine
trees
on
either
side
mean
friendship
the
rocks
underneath
signify
that
my
friendships
have
a
firm
foundation
the
letters
underneath
read
her
book
you
have
to
carve
the
letters
backward
so
they
will
print
forward
the
feather
design
around
the
letters
is
made
from
my
symbol
which
is
the
quill
pen
gladys
sat
watching
migwan
busy
knife
cutting
out
the
design
why
do
you
bring
your
craft
work
and
keep
me
company
asked
migwan
presently
i
hate
craft
work
said
gladys
fretfully
but
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
work
on
my
ceremonial
gown
she
brought
the
gown
and
sat
down
beside
migwan
do
you
think
these
beads
would
be
pretty
hanging
down
this
way
she
asked
pinning
several
strings
of
beads
to
the
leather
collar
you
are
going
to
put
those
beads
on
your
dress
are
you
asked
migwan
in
surprise
why
not
said
gladys
you
got
beads
hanging
all
over
yours
but
they
all
honor
beads
explained
migwan
and
stand
for
something
but
i
have
no
honor
beads
said
gladys
then
you
must
win
some
we
all
went
with
our
dresses
undecorated
until
we
had
won
honors
i
do
care
said
gladys
i
going
to
decorate
mine
i
wo
be
the
only
plain
one
miss
kent
she
called
as
their
guardian
passed
by
with
an
armful
of
firewood
i
may
put
these
beads
on
my
ceremonial
costume
may
i
nyoda
dumped
her
burden
on
the
ground
and
came
over
to
the
girls
of
course
you
may
if
you
want
to
she
said
genially
it
your
dress
but
do
you
want
to
what
does
the
ceremonial
dress
mean
to
you
is
it
only
a
sort
of
masquerade
costume
to
be
decorated
up
just
anyhow
to
make
it
look
fantastic
or
is
it
a
record
of
achievements
written
in
a
language
that
only
camp
fire
girls
understand
just
think
what
it
means
to
sit
in
a
circle
of
girls
and
be
able
to
tell
by
their
costumes
what
kind
of
things
they
have
done
we
pretend
that
a
guardian
from
another
group
has
come
to
look
on
at
our
ceremonial
the
first
one
she
happens
to
see
is
myself
she
looks
at
my
costume
sees
the
symbol
on
the
back
and
the
border
of
small
symbols
around
the
bottom
she
counts
them
there
are
seven
she
says
to
herself
is
the
guardian
and
there
are
seven
girls
in
her
group
she
then
sees
migwan
costume
with
the
four
wakan
honors
for
written
thought
she
knows
that
migwan
has
literary
ability
and
that
her
symbol
is
the
quill
pen
because
there
is
a
quill
sewn
to
the
front
of
her
dress
and
feathers
are
never
used
for
decoration
except
in
case
of
a
personal
symbol
she
knows
that
migwan
had
to
work
hard
for
her
wakan
honors
because
above
the
first
one
there
are
two
shuta
buttons
and
a
keda
showing
that
her
first
efforts
won
only
third
and
second
class
honors
but
she
persevered
until
she
reached
the
first
class
she
knows
sahwah
can
swim
well
because
she
has
a
fish
on
the
side
seam
of
her
gown
which
is
the
place
for
local
or
national
honors
she
knows
chapa
must
be
very
dexterous
in
handcraft
for
she
has
a
great
many
green
beads
on
her
thong
and
then
she
sees
you
with
a
number
of
gaudy
and
meaningless
beads
sewn
around
your
collar
just
what
would
be
her
estimate
of
you
whereas
if
you
had
no
decoration
whatever
on
your
gown
she
would
know
at
once
that
you
had
lately
joined
the
group
and
had
not
yet
won
honors
the
beads
gradually
slipped
from
gladys
hands
i
guess
i
wo
put
them
on
anyhow
she
said
not
without
some
regret
however
said
nyoda
there
is
no
need
of
your
costume
being
utterly
bare
of
ornamentation
i
can
suggest
several
things
which
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
wear
on
your
dress
what
are
they
asked
gladys
looking
interested
the
first
thing
to
do
said
nyoda
is
to
get
your
symbol
put
in
a
conspicuous
place
you
have
designed
your
collar
with
the
long
bands
dropping
from
the
shoulders
now
i
would
apply
your
butterfly
symbol
to
each
band
about
six
inches
from
the
bottom
and
then
cut
the
leather
below
the
symbol
into
fringe
i
would
paint
the
butterflies
red
yellow
and
blue
which
are
the
colors
that
represent
work
health
and
love
you
could
also
produce
the
colors
by
sewing
beads
over
the
design
so
much
for
your
symbol
now
in
the
middle
of
the
hem
in
the
front
of
your
dress
you
may
put
the
winnebago
symbol
the
sign
of
your
tribe
you
will
find
it
on
the
banner
before
the
tents
and
over
the
fireplace
in
the
shack
as
well
as
on
all
the
girls
costumes
it
is
the
indian
sign
and
means
together
it
is
the
secret
of
the
wonderful
team
work
of
the
winnebagos
develop
this
in
wood
brown
and
green
when
you
put
the
fringe
on
the
bottom
instead
of
using
a
straight
piece
leave
the
top
edge
in
uneven
peaks
to
represent
mountains
and
outline
them
with
blue
beads
for
the
sky
above
them
this
will
indicate
that
you
love
nature
there
you
have
the
costume
with
the
thongs
and
fringes
all
ready
to
receive
the
honor
beads
and
there
are
some
honors
you
should
be
able
to
win
very
soon
you
will
receive
a
handcraft
honor
for
making
the
costume
and
a
campcraft
bead
for
making
the
headband
you
have
walked
forty
miles
in
ten
days
on
the
hike
and
the
rest
going
to
and
from
the
village
you
have
done
enough
camp
cooking
to
win
a
bead
you
will
receive
these
beads
next
monday
night
if
you
are
sharp
you
can
have
enough
to
get
your
woodgatherer
ring
ask
nakwisi
to
tell
you
star
lore
also
get
her
to
take
you
into
the
woods
and
help
you
identify
trees
you
can
get
enough
beads
very
soon
to
take
away
your
reproach
of
being
undecorated
while
nyoda
was
instructing
gladys
in
the
mysteries
of
symbolic
decoration
sahwah
and
hinpoha
finishing
their
tennis
game
strolled
into
the
woods
beyond
the
court
looking
for
berries
let
make
a
leaf
cup
and
fill
it
for
migwan
said
thoughtful
hinpoha
poor
migwan
said
sahwah
she
certainly
is
having
a
time
with
that
knee
i
do
see
how
she
can
be
so
patient
i
die
if
i
had
to
sit
in
one
place
all
day
she
a
dead
game
sport
though
and
never
complains
she
does
bushels
of
craft
work
and
studies
i
proud
to
be
in
the
same
group
with
her
all
our
girls
are
good
sports
said
hinpoha
all
but
one
which
one
you
know
you
mean
gladys
yes
she
is
a
good
sport
now
said
hinpoha
but
she
may
develop
into
one
before
the
summer
is
over
let
hope
so
then
she
added
she
surely
has
it
in
for
you
for
some
reason
i
know
it
said
sahwah
and
that
what
gives
me
a
pain
i
never
touched
her
bed
the
night
it
fell
down
but
i
might
as
well
have
but
you
did
paint
her
face
that
night
at
balsam
lake
said
hinpoha
with
a
giggle
at
the
remembrance
yes
but
i
thought
it
was
migwan
and
anyhow
i
apologized
well
said
hinpoha
with
a
burst
of
altruism
it
this
way
gladys
is
as
shallow
as
a
and
a
big
cry
baby
and
all
that
but
if
she
had
been
like
that
her
father
would
have
wanted
her
to
be
a
camp
fire
girl
and
we
never
would
have
come
to
this
camp
it
an
ill
wind
you
know
anyway
she
a
winnebago
now
and
we
have
to
make
something
out
of
her
you
so
said
sahwah
i
wish
i
could
like
everybody
the
way
you
do
hinpoha
opened
her
mouth
to
reply
but
instead
uttered
a
prolonged
they
were
sitting
on
a
log
when
the
above
conversation
took
place
and
hinpoha
had
poked
her
hand
into
the
hollow
end
now
she
drew
it
out
hastily
and
began
to
dance
around
shaking
her
hand
violently
oh
what
is
it
cried
sahwah
bees
shrieked
hinpoha
run
for
your
life
an
angry
buzz
sounded
from
the
log
and
the
bees
began
crawling
out
at
the
end
hinpoha
fled
through
the
woods
with
sahwah
close
at
her
heels
by
the
time
they
reached
camp
hinpoha
hand
was
swelled
all
out
of
shape
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
repress
a
cry
of
pain
nyoda
rose
quickly
when
she
took
in
the
situation
get
some
moist
clay
at
once
she
commanded
there
is
some
in
the
woods
behind
the
shack
sahwah
sped
after
the
clay
and
returned
with
a
large
lump
now
you
make
mud
pies
until
the
inflammation
is
drawn
out
of
your
hand
said
nyoda
hinpoha
dutifully
sat
down
beside
migwan
and
played
in
the
clay
after
she
had
rolled
it
around
in
her
hand
awhile
it
became
a
beautiful
consistency
for
modeling
so
she
began
making
statuettes
of
the
different
girls
she
had
a
great
deal
of
aptness
in
modeling
and
managed
to
make
her
figures
resemble
somewhat
the
girls
they
were
supposed
to
represent
she
became
so
absorbed
in
her
new
occupation
that
she
forgot
the
burning
pain
in
her
hand
and
gradually
the
swelling
went
down
sahwah
came
along
to
see
how
she
was
feeling
and
exclaimed
in
delight
at
the
statuettes
hinpoha
held
up
her
hand
warningly
for
migwan
was
asleep
sahwah
promptly
fell
to
making
hand
signs
of
admiration
hinpoha
laughed
at
her
antics
and
falling
into
her
mood
arrayed
her
figures
in
a
semicircle
on
the
ground
and
sitting
behind
them
made
a
gesture
to
intimate
that
they
were
for
sale
sahwah
sat
down
and
signalled
that
she
had
come
to
buy
she
indicated
several
that
she
would
like
to
have
and
hinpoha
held
up
fingers
for
the
price
nyoda
came
along
and
watched
them
with
keen
amusement
gladys
looked
on
uncomprehendingly
sahwah
purchased
the
winnebagos
in
effigy
paying
for
them
with
pebbles
and
making
hand
signs
to
the
effect
that
she
considered
them
a
bargain
at
the
price
finally
there
was
only
one
left
this
was
gladys
sahwah
refused
to
purchase
hinpoha
lowered
her
price
step
by
step
but
sahwah
waved
her
away
the
other
girls
crowding
around
to
see
the
fun
caught
on
and
giggled
what
the
joke
asked
gladys
nobody
answered
finding
the
eyes
of
several
girls
fixed
on
her
gladys
flushed
something
about
me
she
cried
passionately
i
know
something
about
me
you
know
i
ca
understand
your
old
signs
and
motions
and
you
can
talk
about
me
all
you
want
i
hate
you
she
cried
bursting
into
tears
i
going
home
sahwah
sprang
to
her
feet
the
realization
of
what
she
had
done
knocking
her
speechless
one
look
at
nyoda
pained
and
surprised
face
upset
her
completely
and
she
rushed
off
to
the
woods
by
herself
with
rare
tact
nyoda
smoothed
over
the
difficult
situation
confronting
her
it
was
no
use
to
pass
the
thing
over
as
a
misunderstanding
on
gladys
part
for
flight
condemned
her
putting
her
arm
around
gladys
she
led
her
down
to
the
dock
and
into
the
launch
she
set
the
engine
going
at
full
speed
sending
the
small
craft
through
the
water
like
a
torpedo
the
spray
dashing
over
the
bow
and
drenching
them
both
the
excitement
of
this
mad
flight
through
the
water
made
gladys
forget
her
hurt
feelings
she
watched
nyoda
fascinated
nyoda
was
of
a
decided
athletic
build
tall
and
with
black
hair
and
dark
eyes
and
high
color
she
was
the
picture
of
health
and
joyousness
as
she
stood
at
the
wheel
of
the
launch
her
hair
streaming
out
in
the
wind
her
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
gladys
had
a
real
admiration
for
nyoda
which
was
developing
into
a
crush
and
liked
to
be
alone
with
her
nyoda
could
not
help
seeing
this
and
with
her
deep
insight
into
girl
nature
knew
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
had
worried
her
so
at
first
was
in
her
hands
by
and
by
she
slackened
the
speed
of
the
boat
and
calling
gladys
up
into
the
bow
with
her
she
showed
her
how
to
steer
and
gave
the
wheel
into
her
hands
she
made
no
mention
of
the
occurrence
of
the
afternoon
not
being
clear
in
her
mind
just
how
to
begin
gladys
finally
relieved
her
of
the
task
by
asking
what
was
it
sahwah
was
saying
about
me
this
afternoon
when
she
was
talking
with
her
hands
nyoda
eyed
her
calmly
she
was
saying
anything
about
you
at
all
she
and
hinpoha
were
playing
a
game
a
very
clever
and
original
game
by
the
way
having
an
auction
sale
in
sign
language
sahwah
bought
all
the
figures
but
one
and
then
wishing
a
diversion
refused
the
last
one
it
just
happened
to
be
the
one
representing
you
i
see
cried
gladys
breaking
into
nyoda
explanation
she
would
buy
me
nyoda
felt
weak
inside
and
tingled
with
a
desire
to
shake
sahwah
but
she
never
changed
countenance
i
do
believe
that
ever
occurred
to
her
she
said
loyally
you
are
so
quick
to
jump
at
conclusions
gladys
just
because
you
could
understand
what
they
were
doing
you
thought
it
must
be
something
unpleasant
about
you
your
outburst
at
that
time
frightened
sahwah
so
she
probably
thought
she
had
done
something
dreadful
now
sahwah
feels
badly
and
so
do
all
the
girls
you
do
want
her
to
go
on
feeling
that
way
do
you
gladys
said
nothing
nyoda
slipped
her
arm
around
her
and
smiled
down
at
her
you
know
that
the
girls
are
not
trying
to
make
it
unpleasant
for
you
do
you
now
gladys
smiled
faintly
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
pretty
pleading
nyoda
watching
her
face
saw
that
she
had
gained
her
point
and
you
like
sahwah
and
let
her
like
you
wo
you
she
said
hugging
gladys
to
her
sahwah
was
nowhere
to
be
found
when
nyoda
returned
to
camp
neither
did
she
appear
when
the
supper
bugle
blew
hinpoha
drooped
visibly
without
her
side
partner
but
nyoda
refused
her
permission
to
go
out
and
look
for
sahwah
when
it
began
to
grow
dark
nyoda
took
her
lantern
and
went
into
the
woods
by
herself
she
soon
found
sahwah
crouching
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
sahwah
dear
look
up
said
nyoda
gently
setting
her
lantern
on
the
ground
and
seating
herself
beside
sahwah
sahwah
uncovered
one
eye
oh
nyoda
she
exclaimed
tragically
what
will
i
do
i
never
dare
show
my
face
in
camp
again
what
ever
possessed
me
this
afternoon
and
what
must
you
think
of
me
nyoda
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
depth
of
cheer
up
sister
she
said
kindly
it
not
as
bad
as
all
that
you
were
thoughtless
that
was
all
for
i
will
not
believe
that
you
were
slighting
gladys
intentionally
that
it
cried
sahwah
eagerly
i
never
stopped
to
think
what
i
was
doing
and
i
never
dreamed
that
she
would
catch
on
nyoda
nodded
sympathetically
i
know
just
how
it
is
she
said
we
never
mean
to
do
unkind
things
and
yet
we
do
them
right
along
without
thinking
the
only
remedy
is
to
get
a
habit
of
thinking
before
we
do
anything
not
thinking
is
my
besetting
sin
said
sahwah
dolefully
yes
said
nyoda
frankly
i
believe
it
is
you
do
so
many
things
impulsively
that
you
never
would
have
done
on
second
thought
take
the
time
for
instance
that
you
jumped
off
the
tower
into
the
canoe
and
upset
it
that
was
a
very
dangerous
thing
to
do
you
might
have
landed
on
top
of
one
of
those
girls
and
hurt
her
badly
or
been
hurt
yourself
even
granting
that
you
were
so
sure
of
yourself
that
you
could
do
it
successfully
you
set
a
bad
example
some
of
the
other
girls
might
be
tempted
to
try
it
sometime
with
disastrous
results
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
said
sahwah
seriously
awfully
sorry
i
hurt
gladys
feelings
and
i
apologize
to
her
this
very
night
i
do
believe
an
apology
would
help
matters
any
said
nyoda
slowly
there
are
some
things
you
ca
make
right
with
an
apology
any
more
than
you
could
mend
migwan
dislocated
knee
by
saying
you
were
sorry
it
got
fallen
on
it
takes
special
treatment
what
shall
i
do
then
asked
sahwah
be
especially
nice
to
gladys
from
now
on
offer
to
help
her
learn
to
swim
and
go
out
with
her
in
the
sponson
until
she
may
go
out
in
a
canoe
let
her
see
by
your
actions
that
you
want
to
be
her
friend
and
then
she
wo
suspect
you
of
saying
unkind
things
about
her
put
yourself
in
her
place
she
feels
just
as
strange
among
you
strong
girls
as
you
would
among
her
friends
you
know
a
great
deal
that
she
does
not
and
she
undoubtedly
knows
a
great
deal
that
you
do
not
she
has
been
abroad
several
times
and
spent
a
whole
year
in
school
in
france
while
her
father
was
there
on
business
she
paints
china
beautifully
sings
well
and
does
fancy
dancing
in
fact
she
dances
so
well
that
various
people
have
tried
to
persuade
her
father
to
allow
her
to
take
it
up
as
a
profession
this
last
statement
did
not
make
such
an
impression
on
sahwah
as
nyoda
expected
it
would
for
gladys
had
boasted
of
her
dancing
to
the
girls
ever
since
she
had
come
to
camp
and
had
made
fun
of
the
simple
folk
dances
the
girls
did
among
themselves
sahwah
however
was
still
deeply
ashamed
of
her
performance
of
the
afternoon
and
eager
to
atone
for
it
and
regain
her
standing
in
nyoda
eyes
so
she
made
up
her
mind
that
gladys
was
a
superior
being
whose
superiority
would
be
unveiled
by
constant
effort
on
her
part
and
promised
to
devote
her
entire
time
to
teaching
her
the
delights
of
camping
then
hand
in
hand
she
and
nyoda
returned
to
the
tents
chapter
vi
the
rain
bird
shakes
his
wings
true
to
her
promise
sahwah
began
the
very
next
morning
cultivating
gladys
have
you
any
middies
you
want
washed
she
asked
as
she
dumped
her
own
into
the
kettle
over
the
fire
every
one
i
own
is
soiled
replied
gladys
bring
them
along
then
said
sahwah
and
we
do
them
together
gladys
brought
her
middies
and
sahwah
popped
them
into
the
boiling
soapsuds
stirring
them
around
with
a
stick
when
they
had
boiled
a
few
minutes
she
fished
them
out
into
a
pail
and
carried
them
down
to
the
lake
for
rinsing
gladys
walked
along
but
she
did
not
offer
to
help
carry
the
pail
sahwah
rinsed
the
soapy
pieces
in
the
clear
water
and
was
spreading
them
out
on
the
rocks
in
the
sun
when
she
noticed
that
the
which
had
been
making
its
morning
stop
at
wharton
landing
was
headed
their
way
instead
of
passing
out
through
the
gap
who
can
be
coming
to
see
us
she
said
to
gladys
the
boat
stop
unless
it
had
a
passenger
for
our
supplies
came
yesterday
it
was
not
a
passenger
however
that
was
left
on
the
winnebago
dock
but
a
wooden
box
from
the
express
company
the
girls
crowded
around
to
get
a
look
at
it
it
was
addressed
to
the
winnebago
camp
fire
girls
camp
winnebago
loon
lake
maine
sahwah
ran
and
got
a
hammer
and
soon
had
the
box
open
what
is
it
cried
the
girls
it
a
sail
exclaimed
sahwah
looking
at
it
closely
the
kind
you
put
on
canoes
attached
to
the
lid
of
the
box
was
a
card
which
read
to
the
winnebagos
to
save
them
the
trouble
of
harnessing
themselves
to
their
canoe
to
make
it
go
in
remembrance
of
a
delightful
day
spent
in
their
camp
emerson
bentley
frank
d
wheeler
o
joy
exclaimed
sahwah
clapping
her
hands
maybe
we
have
some
fun
now
just
wait
until
i
get
it
adjusted
she
spent
most
of
the
day
hoisting
that
sail
on
one
of
the
canoes
but
finally
had
it
finished
and
went
darting
around
on
the
lake
like
a
bird
taking
the
other
girls
out
with
her
in
turn
it
too
bad
you
ca
go
out
in
a
canoe
she
said
to
gladys
with
real
regret
i
should
love
to
have
you
go
sailing
with
me
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
and
gladys
had
to
stay
on
shore
wo
you
let
me
help
you
she
asked
gladys
at
the
next
swimming
period
i
hold
you
up
if
you
try
to
float
but
gladys
would
not
let
any
one
touch
her
in
the
water
except
nyoda
when
nyoda
was
directing
the
other
girls
gladys
stood
out
on
the
beach
how
am
i
going
to
help
gladys
learn
to
swim
if
she
let
me
thought
sahwah
in
despair
do
go
too
far
out
on
the
lake
nyoda
warned
sahwah
that
afternoon
her
eye
on
a
bank
of
clouds
that
was
rolling
up
in
the
west
i
know
there
a
storm
coming
and
i
be
careful
promised
sahwah
mindful
of
her
new
resolution
to
think
before
she
acted
but
the
wind
is
so
strong
now
it
great
fun
to
be
out
sailing
i
stay
near
shore
the
storm
that
had
been
threatening
broke
loose
about
supper
time
and
the
girls
ran
to
fasten
down
their
tents
whew
said
sahwah
struggling
with
a
tent
flap
listen
to
the
wind
the
great
pines
were
roaring
deafeningly
and
the
lake
lashed
into
fury
was
dashing
high
against
the
cliff
where
are
you
going
said
nyoda
imperatively
as
hinpoha
started
down
the
path
to
the
lake
in
her
bathing
suit
to
bring
in
the
flag
answered
hinpoha
it
be
torn
to
pieces
in
that
gale
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
stand
upright
on
the
dock
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
slanting
sheets
that
closed
round
her
like
a
fog
she
untied
the
ropes
that
held
the
flag
and
tried
to
lower
it
but
it
would
not
come
something
was
wrong
with
the
pulley
the
flag
was
flapping
in
the
wind
and
straining
at
the
ropes
like
a
spirited
horse
no
help
for
it
said
hinpoha
to
herself
i
have
to
go
up
on
top
the
tower
swayed
in
the
wind
as
she
mounted
the
ladder
and
the
rain
dashed
in
her
face
blinding
her
great
crashes
of
thunder
sounded
in
her
ears
and
the
lightning
flashed
all
around
her
up
on
top
it
was
worse
yet
the
wind
whipped
her
long
hair
out
and
threatened
to
hurl
her
from
the
little
platform
so
she
did
not
dare
let
go
of
the
railing
with
one
hand
while
she
released
the
pulley
with
the
other
glory
she
whispered
as
she
cautiously
descended
the
ladder
but
the
thunder
bird
has
it
in
for
us
she
sped
up
the
path
with
the
precious
flag
held
against
her
bosom
and
found
the
girls
gathered
in
the
shack
nyoda
was
kindling
a
fire
in
the
big
open
fireplace
and
the
girls
were
seated
in
a
circle
before
it
then
nyoda
raising
her
voice
above
the
patter
of
the
raindrops
on
the
roof
read
aloud
while
the
girls
did
craft
work
by
the
light
of
lanterns
the
evening
wore
away
pleasantly
but
the
rain
continued
at
bed
time
they
wrapped
their
ponchos
around
them
and
ran
for
the
tents
the
hollows
between
the
rocks
were
veritable
rivers
and
in
the
inky
darkness
more
than
one
girl
stepped
squarely
into
the
flood
i
soaked
to
the
skin
panted
sahwah
running
into
the
tent
and
quickly
closing
the
flap
behind
her
and
i
stepped
into
a
puddle
up
to
my
knees
so
am
i
said
hinpoha
who
was
divesting
herself
of
her
clothes
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
did
you
ever
see
such
a
downpour
cheer
up
said
migwan
who
had
gone
to
bed
early
in
the
evening
with
a
headache
and
stayed
in
during
the
storm
the
tent
leak
anyway
we
be
perfectly
dry
in
here
it
be
all
right
if
the
tent
does
blow
over
said
sahwah
whew
listen
to
that
the
girls
held
their
breath
as
a
particularly
fierce
blast
hurled
itself
against
the
canvas
sides
of
their
shelter
gladys
sat
on
the
bed
and
trembled
sahwah
hastened
to
reassure
her
it
probably
blow
down
she
said
cheerfully
these
tents
are
made
pretty
strong
and
the
ropes
on
this
one
are
all
new
but
there
is
always
the
possibility
do
you
mind
if
i
take
your
laundry
bag
down
it
is
pinned
to
the
side
of
the
tent
and
will
lead
the
water
through
the
girls
slept
very
little
that
night
although
the
tent
withstood
the
storm
and
remained
standing
the
rain
still
fell
with
unabated
vigor
at
dawn
at
about
six
nyoda
put
her
head
into
the
tent
and
called
sahwah
sahwah
was
alert
instantly
nyoda
had
on
her
bathing
suit
and
cap
what
is
it
asked
sahwah
one
of
the
canoes
has
broken
away
and
is
floating
off
nyoda
said
in
a
low
tone
so
as
not
to
disturb
gladys
and
migwan
who
were
still
sleeping
hinpoha
sat
up
and
listened
i
am
going
after
it
in
the
launch
continued
nyoda
and
will
need
help
put
on
your
bathing
suit
and
come
let
me
come
too
begged
hinpoha
all
right
said
nyoda
and
the
three
crept
out
of
the
tent
and
down
the
path
to
the
lake
the
water
had
risen
at
least
a
foot
and
the
floor
of
the
dock
was
flooded
about
half
a
mile
out
in
the
lake
they
saw
the
runaway
canoe
now
standing
on
end
now
floating
bottom
up
would
it
float
in
by
itself
asked
sahwah
nyoda
shook
her
head
it
might
float
in
all
right
she
said
but
it
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
on
the
other
side
you
notice
it
is
being
carried
farther
away
from
us
all
the
time
if
we
want
that
canoe
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
we
have
to
go
after
it
that
was
the
most
exciting
launch
ride
the
two
girls
had
ever
taken
the
little
boat
rode
up
and
down
on
the
waves
like
an
egg
shell
the
water
going
over
her
constantly
drenching
the
girls
and
threatening
to
swamp
the
engine
the
wind
whirled
the
rain
against
their
faces
nyoda
stood
up
in
the
bow
handling
the
wheel
as
calmly
as
if
she
were
pouring
tea
at
a
reception
nyoda
strong
point
was
her
composure
it
was
next
thing
to
impossible
to
get
her
excited
they
caught
up
with
the
canoe
and
sahwah
and
hinpoha
managed
to
right
it
and
fasten
it
to
the
launch
with
a
rope
they
got
back
to
the
dock
without
mishap
and
pulled
the
canoe
high
up
where
it
could
not
be
washed
away
a
second
time
sahwah
and
hinpoha
returned
to
the
tent
red
as
roses
from
their
exposure
to
the
wind
and
rain
and
recounted
their
early
morning
adventure
to
migwan
and
gladys
at
breakfast
time
they
had
to
put
on
their
ponchos
again
and
pick
their
way
through
the
puddles
to
the
shack
where
they
ate
their
breakfast
the
mess
tent
was
leaking
merrily
in
a
dozen
places
by
noon
there
was
still
no
let
up
in
the
downpour
rest
hour
was
spent
on
the
floor
in
the
shack
when
nyoda
came
in
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
from
a
tour
of
inspection
she
announced
that
both
the
alpha
and
omega
tents
were
leaking
badly
and
the
bedding
was
getting
wet
she
made
the
girls
bring
their
blankets
rolled
up
in
their
ponchos
into
the
shack
and
spread
them
out
before
the
fire
the
shack
was
pretty
well
crowded
before
the
afternoon
was
over
besides
all
the
girls
and
the
bedding
and
the
partially
painted
paddles
that
stood
around
everywhere
nyoda
brought
in
a
large
supply
of
fire
wood
it
was
all
damp
and
had
to
be
dried
out
before
it
would
burn
the
rain
whirled
against
the
windows
as
if
seeking
entrance
by
force
but
the
girls
inside
safe
and
dry
made
merry
before
the
fire
nyoda
taught
them
a
new
game
called
johnny
where
are
you
she
blindfolded
hinpoha
and
sahwah
and
set
them
on
the
floor
then
each
one
in
turn
had
to
call
johnny
where
are
you
and
upon
the
other
one
answering
here
whacked
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
with
a
newspaper
both
had
to
keep
one
hand
on
a
on
the
floor
between
them
sahwah
and
hinpoha
both
gave
and
received
some
sounding
whacks
and
kept
the
watchers
in
a
roar
of
laughter
with
their
efforts
to
dodge
each
other
towards
the
end
nyoda
slipped
up
and
removed
the
bandage
from
hinpoha
eyes
and
let
her
whack
sahwah
with
her
eyes
open
and
poor
sahwah
wondered
why
she
could
not
dodge
the
attacks
any
better
after
supper
nyoda
proposed
playing
aeroplane
she
shooed
all
the
girls
but
hinpoha
out
into
the
kitchen
one
by
one
they
were
blindfolded
and
led
in
sahwah
was
the
first
she
was
led
into
the
center
of
the
room
and
there
brought
to
a
halt
step
up
commanded
some
one
sahwah
did
as
she
was
told
and
her
feet
were
planted
on
something
that
felt
like
a
platform
now
hang
on
they
ordered
she
hung
it
seemed
to
be
hair
she
was
hanging
on
to
up
with
her
sahwah
felt
herself
rising
up
up
the
hair
sank
out
of
her
grasp
the
board
wobbled
under
her
feet
straight
up
toward
the
ceiling
she
went
past
the
rafters
and
on
up
until
her
head
struck
the
roof
the
board
wobbled
much
worse
jump
they
shouted
sahwah
gathered
her
forces
for
a
mighty
leap
determining
to
strike
the
floor
with
knees
bent
so
as
to
break
the
shock
she
struck
solid
ground
before
she
had
fairly
started
the
bandage
was
taken
from
her
eyes
she
was
standing
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fireplace
beside
her
was
the
aeroplane
it
was
a
plain
wooden
board
when
she
had
stood
on
it
they
had
lifted
it
up
and
hinpoha
whose
head
she
had
seized
upon
to
support
herself
had
gradually
stooped
down
to
enhance
sahwah
sensation
of
going
up
to
complete
illusion
they
hit
her
on
the
head
with
a
book
to
make
her
think
she
had
struck
the
ceiling
she
had
risen
about
six
inches
from
the
floor
in
all
although
she
was
sure
she
had
gone
up
six
feet
at
least
her
mighty
leap
caused
the
conductors
much
merriment
gladys
did
still
better
she
fell
off
without
jumping
when
bedtime
came
there
was
no
thinking
of
going
to
the
tents
so
the
beds
were
made
up
on
the
floor
in
a
circle
about
the
fireplace
does
this
count
toward
our
honor
for
sleeping
five
nights
on
the
ground
asked
sahwah
it
ought
to
said
hinpoha
it
harder
than
the
ground
morning
found
the
rain
still
unabated
this
is
getting
monotonous
said
migwan
looking
out
at
the
grey
skies
and
the
lake
shrouded
in
mist
ca
we
take
our
dip
even
if
it
is
raining
asked
sahwah
anxiously
i
do
see
why
not
said
nyoda
but
when
they
were
in
their
bathing
suits
and
ready
to
start
they
found
they
could
not
open
the
porch
door
of
the
shack
what
the
matter
said
nyoda
lowering
one
of
the
windows
and
looking
out
oh
look
at
the
porch
floor
she
cried
the
flooring
had
warped
up
into
a
great
hump
before
the
door
preventing
its
being
opened
it
looks
like
a
roller
coaster
said
migwan
the
girls
were
obliged
to
make
their
exit
and
through
the
window
hurray
no
tent
inspection
cried
hinpoha
picking
up
her
blankets
from
the
floor
to
make
room
for
craft
work
it
take
more
than
inspection
to
fix
your
tent
up
again
said
nyoda
looking
out
of
the
side
window
of
the
shack
why
said
hinpoha
come
here
and
look
said
nyoda
why
it
fallen
down
cried
hinpoha
looking
over
shoulder
the
girls
pressed
to
the
window
to
see
the
heap
of
canvas
that
had
been
the
omega
tent
is
alpha
still
standing
asked
the
inhabitants
of
that
tent
craning
their
necks
yes
answered
nyoda
which
proves
its
superiority
once
for
all
the
alphas
swelled
out
their
chests
and
made
triumphant
grimaces
at
the
omegas
i
do
care
declared
sahwah
i
rather
be
an
omega
any
day
than
an
alpha
we
have
a
better
view
of
the
lake
but
we
keep
our
tent
neater
said
chapa
and
so
it
looks
better
like
fun
you
keep
yours
neater
returned
sahwah
we
get
higher
marks
than
you
right
along
said
chapa
and
that
goes
to
show
well
flashed
sahwah
we
get
higher
marks
if
it
for
just
in
time
she
remembered
her
promise
and
broke
off
abruptly
if
it
was
for
what
asked
chapa
for
the
wind
blowing
our
things
around
so
she
finished
lamely
and
fell
to
carving
her
wood
block
furiously
let
sing
something
said
nyoda
hastily
migwan
and
hinpoha
sing
owl
and
the
pussy
cat
cried
the
girls
in
chorus
thus
urged
the
two
mounted
the
piano
bench
and
acted
out
the
romantic
tale
as
they
sang
the
words
now
let
all
sing
something
said
nyoda
when
the
amorous
owl
and
the
impassioned
pussy
had
danced
themselves
off
the
bench
what
were
some
of
those
songs
we
sang
on
the
hike
let
sing
migwan
latest
song
we
are
winnebagos
said
hinpoha
that
has
a
good
swing
to
it
said
nyoda
when
they
had
sung
it
several
times
sahwah
dear
follow
the
tune
more
closely
with
your
tenor
you
put
us
out
well
i
to
sing
anyhow
said
sahwah
even
if
i
ca
and
that
more
than
some
people
do
this
last
was
a
direct
reference
to
gladys
although
she
was
supposed
to
have
a
very
good
and
voice
and
had
done
much
solo
singing
in
her
time
gladys
steadfastly
refused
to
sing
along
with
the
other
girls
in
chorus
once
or
twice
after
much
coaxing
on
nyoda
part
she
had
consented
to
sing
a
solo
on
sunday
morning
or
on
stunt
night
but
sing
mornings
in
the
shack
with
the
others
she
would
not
they
laid
it
to
the
fact
that
she
considered
herself
better
than
themselves
and
did
not
want
to
mix
in
their
doings
and
it
put
a
damper
on
their
own
singing
because
they
thought
she
was
criticising
them
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
once
an
enthusiastic
teacher
of
hers
had
pronounced
her
voice
different
from
others
and
told
her
that
chorus
singing
would
spoil
it
so
from
then
on
she
refused
to
blend
her
voice
with
others
she
knew
well
enough
that
this
was
ridiculous
but
it
pleased
her
vanity
and
she
kept
it
up
she
would
not
come
right
out
and
tell
why
however
but
simply
said
she
did
feel
like
singing
naturally
the
girls
thought
her
reason
a
personal
one
and
it
made
bad
feeling
all
around
her
refusal
to
sing
puzzled
and
grieved
nyoda
more
than
anything
else
she
did
the
winnebagos
were
known
as
a
singing
group
and
the
addition
of
a
trained
voice
was
very
welcome
nyoda
thought
of
course
that
gladys
would
lead
the
singing
in
great
shape
and
her
disappointment
at
her
attitude
was
very
keen
yes
sahwah
said
nyoda
warmly
your
willingness
to
use
the
talents
you
have
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
love
you
so
i
think
that
any
one
who
can
sing
and
wo
is
is
a
sport
said
hinpoha
emphatically
maybe
i
have
a
reason
for
not
singing
said
gladys
in
a
lofty
manner
well
what
is
it
said
sahwah
exasperated
into
sharp
speech
gladys
pursed
up
her
lips
but
did
not
reply
nyoda
saw
that
a
storm
was
brewing
it
was
the
inevitable
result
of
the
girls
having
been
pent
up
so
close
together
for
over
two
days
she
pulled
out
her
watch
it
time
for
folk
dancing
she
announced
briskly
the
girls
looked
out
of
the
window
the
rain
was
still
teeming
down
who
game
to
put
on
her
bathing
suit
and
dance
in
the
rain
asked
nyoda
i
i
cried
all
the
girls
they
followed
her
to
the
tennis
court
where
they
did
such
dances
as
they
could
without
music
and
ended
up
with
a
lively
game
of
three
deep
the
water
running
down
over
their
faces
let
play
the
leader
said
nyoda
when
they
had
grown
tired
of
three
deep
follow
me
she
led
them
a
wild
chase
all
over
the
camp
over
rocks
and
stumps
around
trees
and
through
puddles
then
down
on
the
dock
she
dove
into
the
lake
swam
around
the
dock
climbed
out
on
the
rocks
out
on
the
dock
again
and
climbed
the
tower
from
which
she
jumped
the
girls
keeping
close
behind
her
all
except
gladys
by
the
time
swimming
hour
was
over
the
girls
had
let
off
enough
steam
to
dwell
together
again
in
peace
and
amity
late
that
afternoon
the
rain
ceased
and
the
sun
peeped
out
pale
and
wan
from
his
long
imprisonment
at
the
first
beam
that
shone
through
the
girls
were
out
of
the
shack
with
a
whoop
and
began
putting
up
the
omega
tent
let
hinpoha
and
me
do
it
alone
shrieked
sahwah
pushing
the
others
away
if
only
two
do
it
we
get
an
honor
if
more
help
we
do
said
nyoda
stepping
back
do
your
worst
you
two
the
tent
was
and
the
girls
scrambled
around
looking
for
their
scattered
possessions
and
the
looking
glass
did
even
break
said
migwan
picking
it
up
from
one
of
the
beds
where
it
had
landed
when
the
tent
went
down
the
next
morning
the
sun
shone
in
splendor
and
the
sky
was
deep
blue
and
cloudless
while
a
high
wind
did
its
best
to
dry
up
the
ground
is
it
fine
to
be
dry
again
said
migwan
looking
approvingly
at
her
canvas
shoes
for
the
last
three
days
felt
like
a
sponge
goodness
but
the
lake
is
rough
said
nyoda
watching
sahwah
out
in
a
canoe
which
was
nearly
standing
on
end
her
hair
stood
out
straight
behind
her
in
the
wind
and
she
reminded
nyoda
of
the
picture
of
the
girl
going
over
the
falls
in
the
legend
of
niagara
there
i
knew
she
would
tip
for
goodness
sake
what
is
she
doing
now
for
sahwah
had
climbed
on
top
of
the
overturned
canoe
and
was
trying
to
paddle
it
in
wrong
side
up
she
kept
her
eyes
on
sahwah
watching
her
rather
slow
progress
through
the
waves
and
did
not
see
a
party
of
people
who
were
coming
up
the
path
from
the
road
until
they
were
right
beside
her
her
attention
was
attracted
by
a
cry
from
migwan
she
turned
and
saw
a
man
and
woman
with
a
little
boy
about
three
years
old
why
that
little
boy
said
migwan
the
one
i
saw
in
the
woods
that
morning
then
you
are
the
young
lady
we
are
looking
for
said
the
man
coming
forward
we
have
you
to
thank
that
we
have
our
boy
with
us
it
was
you
who
put
us
on
the
track
of
the
men
who
had
kidnapped
him
he
kidnapped
then
said
migwan
yes
answered
the
boy
father
he
was
taken
from
our
camp
by
those
two
men
whom
you
saw
thanks
to
your
picture
of
them
we
put
the
police
on
their
trail
and
caught
them
in
portland
we
are
just
coming
home
with
him
now
and
wanted
to
see
you
this
is
bartlett
my
wife
and
our
son
raymond
whom
you
have
already
seen
come
right
up
and
sit
down
said
nyoda
cordially
and
tell
us
all
about
it
we
have
been
curious
to
know
whether
the
little
boy
was
ever
found
or
not
they
told
how
the
little
boy
was
missed
from
their
camp
that
thursday
night
and
of
their
frantic
search
along
the
shore
thinking
he
had
fallen
into
the
lake
then
some
one
found
a
toy
sailboat
of
his
in
the
woods
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
either
wandered
off
or
been
carried
away
no
trace
of
any
abductor
could
be
found
however
and
it
would
have
been
hard
work
running
the
men
down
if
it
had
not
been
for
migwan
picture
of
them
with
the
boy
and
her
report
that
they
were
headed
for
the
loon
lake
boat
when
found
little
raymond
was
dressed
in
clothes
and
effectually
disguised
then
migwan
told
the
story
of
her
fall
down
the
cliff
and
her
night
in
the
woods
and
her
seeing
the
three
on
the
path
in
the
morning
it
was
just
like
a
fairy
tale
by
the
way
said
bartlett
when
she
had
finished
did
you
know
that
i
had
offered
a
reward
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
to
any
one
giving
information
which
would
lead
to
recovery
no
said
migwan
i
did
well
said
bartlett
that
what
i
did
and
i
do
see
that
any
one
is
entitled
to
it
but
yourself
you
gave
us
the
only
definite
clue
we
had
to
work
on
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
madam
to
pay
my
just
debts
and
he
handed
migwan
a
check
migwan
stared
at
the
slip
of
paper
in
a
dazed
fashion
she
could
not
comprehend
the
good
fortune
that
had
suddenly
come
to
her
then
she
handed
the
check
back
to
bartlett
i
ca
take
your
money
she
said
i
really
did
do
anything
you
know
that
all
right
said
bartlett
waving
her
back
you
did
a
whole
lot
more
than
you
know
young
lady
just
think
of
the
worry
and
anxiety
you
have
saved
us
it
worth
the
money
every
cent
of
it
i
only
wish
i
could
offer
a
larger
reward
so
migwan
still
protesting
was
forced
to
accept
the
check
and
the
bartletts
rose
to
go
come
over
and
see
us
sometime
said
bartlett
cordially
and
bring
all
the
girls
along
you
might
have
a
sleeping
party
on
our
lawn
that
will
be
fine
and
i
accept
the
invitation
in
behalf
of
my
girls
said
nyoda
as
she
accompanied
them
to
the
road
where
their
car
stood
up
on
the
shack
porch
migwan
was
the
center
of
an
excited
group
and
the
check
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
sahwah
sighed
enviously
and
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
she
might
be
the
heroine
of
the
hour
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
that
money
asked
one
of
the
girls
it
looks
said
migwan
in
an
awed
tone
hugging
the
precious
check
in
her
hands
as
if
i
were
really
going
to
college
after
all
chapter
vii
sahwah
the
sunfish
migwan
sat
on
a
rock
on
the
beach
making
notes
in
her
journal
now
and
then
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
lake
to
watch
the
shadows
gliding
across
the
water
as
the
clouds
floated
by
overhead
sometimes
the
sunlight
was
darkened
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
lake
looked
gray
and
cold
but
on
the
opposite
shore
a
tiny
village
nestled
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
and
over
there
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
white
houses
gleamed
brightly
against
the
dull
brown
background
it
looks
like
a
mirage
said
migwan
to
hinpoha
who
had
dropped
down
on
the
sand
at
her
feet
hinpoha
glanced
across
the
lake
at
the
fairy
scene
and
then
back
at
migwan
what
are
you
always
writing
in
that
book
of
yours
she
asked
curiously
would
you
like
to
know
though
replied
migwan
closing
it
up
oh
let
me
see
some
of
it
wo
you
migwan
dear
said
hinpoha
coaxingly
i
love
to
read
what
you
write
and
i
never
make
fun
of
it
you
know
that
please
do
after
a
little
more
coaxing
migwan
relented
and
handed
hinpoha
the
page
she
had
just
written
hinpoha
spread
it
out
on
her
knee
and
read
i
was
sitting
in
the
woods
rather
pensively
the
other
day
when
i
suddenly
became
aware
of
two
merry
eyes
fixed
on
me
from
the
ground
beside
me
there
was
something
so
irresistibly
roguish
in
their
expression
that
my
sadness
leaked
out
of
me
unceremoniously
as
i
looked
the
eyes
disappeared
behind
a
leaf
only
to
appear
an
instant
later
on
the
other
side
and
a
tiny
round
red
face
nodded
cheerfully
at
me
visions
of
wood
sprites
went
through
my
head
and
i
sat
perfectly
still
so
as
not
to
frighten
him
away
he
had
retired
behind
his
leaf
after
that
last
nod
but
as
i
made
no
sound
he
soon
looked
out
again
to
see
if
i
was
still
there
this
time
i
got
a
good
look
at
him
he
was
no
elf
but
a
berry
a
brilliant
round
red
berry
with
two
little
holes
in
him
that
looked
just
like
eyes
a
cheerful
berry
i
thought
a
whole
face
so
i
made
him
a
nose
and
mouth
with
my
pencil
when
last
i
saw
him
he
was
still
playing
among
the
leaves
enjoying
the
world
for
all
he
was
worth
oh
how
lovely
exclaimed
hinpoha
when
she
had
read
that
far
you
must
let
the
other
girls
read
this
would
you
like
me
to
illustrate
it
for
you
i
just
itching
to
paint
that
little
red
berry
that
will
be
fine
said
migwan
and
hinpoha
sped
after
her
paint
box
hinpoha
could
not
have
written
that
little
sketch
if
her
life
depended
upon
it
but
her
talent
with
the
brush
was
unmistakable
with
a
few
deft
strokes
she
pictured
migwan
sitting
in
the
woods
and
beside
her
the
little
red
berry
with
its
comical
face
now
it
was
migwan
turn
to
admire
hinpoha
went
on
to
the
next
paragraph
i
walked
on
through
the
wood
admiring
the
little
green
moss
stars
that
twinkled
up
from
the
ground
i
must
get
a
closer
view
i
said
half
aloud
and
immediately
my
wish
was
granted
for
a
pine
tree
put
out
his
foot
and
tripped
me
and
i
fell
with
my
face
right
in
the
moss
how
i
should
like
to
have
seen
you
laughed
hinpoha
as
she
painted
migwan
sprawling
on
the
ground
have
you
some
more
stuff
i
can
illustrate
there
such
a
lot
of
paint
mixed
up
oh
here
another
one
she
said
turning
over
the
pages
i
am
sitting
in
the
woods
near
sandy
beach
have
been
gathering
blueberries
and
my
cup
runneth
over
the
sun
has
turned
the
beach
into
a
sahara
but
here
in
the
woods
it
is
dim
and
cool
and
pleasant
i
am
leaning
against
a
big
tree
with
my
feet
stretched
out
in
front
of
me
there
is
a
spider
weaving
a
web
from
one
foot
to
the
other
i
hate
to
break
down
his
handiwork
or
rather
his
footiwork
but
i
ca
stay
here
forever
much
as
i
would
like
to
he
ought
to
have
been
more
careful
about
getting
a
clear
title
to
his
property
before
building
this
will
teach
him
a
lesson
i
think
just
now
a
tiny
red
squirrel
ran
down
a
tree
paused
beside
me
gave
an
impertinent
whisk
of
his
tail
and
disappeared
girl
he
seemed
to
say
away
this
beautiful
summer
weather
when
you
ought
to
be
storing
nuts
for
the
winter
repent
when
the
snow
begins
to
fly
idle
in
summer
hungry
in
winter
with
a
disapproving
cough
he
disappeared
there
is
a
blueberry
bush
nearby
hanging
full
of
large
luscious
berries
i
never
saw
blueberries
in
their
native
wilds
before
i
had
a
sort
of
hazy
notion
that
blueberries
grew
in
quart
boxes
in
market
stalls
that
reminds
me
said
hinpoha
suddenly
it
must
be
getting
near
time
for
our
promised
trip
to
blueberry
island
she
painted
a
bush
with
berries
nearly
as
big
as
marbles
and
read
on
eagerly
i
have
surprised
an
acorn
in
a
gross
neglect
of
duty
he
is
lying
on
the
ground
where
he
fell
last
fall
and
has
sprouted
in
the
least
i
thought
all
acorns
aspired
to
be
oak
trees
think
of
being
a
nut
half
an
inch
long
and
in
that
half
inch
to
have
the
power
of
becoming
the
king
of
the
forest
and
then
let
that
power
lie
unused
if
i
were
an
acorn
i
would
feel
eternally
disgraced
if
i
had
sprouted
hinpoha
duly
portrayed
the
delinquent
acorn
i
tell
you
what
we
do
when
we
grow
up
she
said
leaning
back
and
surveying
her
work
critically
you
write
books
and
i
illustrate
them
all
this
time
nyoda
and
sahwah
had
been
working
on
a
canoe
a
little
farther
up
the
beach
sahwah
had
crossed
the
lake
in
the
dark
the
night
before
and
had
grounded
on
a
sharp
rock
that
jutted
up
just
underneath
the
surface
ripping
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
nearly
a
foot
long
now
she
and
nyoda
were
repairing
the
damage
do
anybody
take
this
canoe
out
for
a
couple
of
days
said
nyoda
to
the
girls
the
pine
pitch
we
put
on
is
hard
yet
hinpoha
showed
nyoda
the
leaves
from
migwan
journal
which
she
had
illustrated
and
nyoda
was
delighted
you
two
had
better
form
a
permanent
partnership
she
advised
you
will
produce
something
worth
while
in
time
then
she
added
would
it
be
a
fine
idea
for
you
to
make
an
illustrated
book
of
the
camp
doings
and
send
it
to
professor
bentley
and
professor
wheeler
as
long
as
they
are
so
much
interested
in
camp
fire
girls
nothing
would
please
them
better
migwan
and
hinpoha
were
enthusiastic
over
the
idea
and
promised
to
begin
that
very
day
sahwah
having
determined
not
to
clash
with
gladys
again
and
to
make
a
friend
of
her
at
all
costs
lost
no
opportunity
to
do
her
service
she
filled
gladys
water
pail
in
the
morning
she
hung
up
her
wet
bathing
suit
when
gladys
had
gone
off
and
left
it
lying
on
the
tent
floor
she
paddled
her
out
in
the
heavy
sponson
when
she
was
dying
to
skim
over
the
lake
in
the
sailing
canoe
and
in
short
sacrificed
herself
at
every
turn
for
gladys
and
gladys
in
time
began
to
look
on
her
as
a
sort
of
serving
maid
who
would
do
any
unpleasant
task
she
happened
to
want
done
nyoda
could
not
help
noticing
this
and
wondered
how
long
sahwah
would
stand
for
it
but
she
said
nothing
to
either
one
of
them
preferring
to
watch
matters
take
their
course
things
finally
came
to
a
head
one
afternoon
during
rest
hour
sahwah
was
out
of
sorts
that
day
the
night
before
she
had
stayed
out
on
the
lake
after
she
had
promised
to
come
in
and
as
a
result
had
injured
the
canoe
in
the
darkness
while
nyoda
had
not
scolded
her
for
staying
out
so
long
she
knew
she
was
disappointed
in
her
and
it
made
her
cross
with
herself
then
the
first
thing
that
morning
she
had
received
a
letter
from
her
mother
chiding
her
for
not
having
written
home
for
two
weeks
that
made
her
crosser
yet
during
the
folk
dancing
hour
she
could
not
keep
her
mind
on
her
feet
and
blundered
so
many
times
that
gladys
who
was
her
partner
left
the
ring
in
disgust
sahwah
was
sensitive
about
her
dancing
which
did
not
come
very
easy
to
her
and
tried
especially
hard
when
dancing
with
gladys
who
did
the
figures
with
wonderful
grace
and
skill
and
gladys
conduct
on
this
occasion
filled
her
with
unutterable
mortification
sahwah
rushed
away
to
her
tent
and
got
into
her
bathing
suit
and
sat
down
on
the
dock
impatiently
waiting
for
nyoda
all
in
in
swimming
hour
she
managed
to
get
herself
into
disfavor
again
hinpoha
was
taking
her
test
for
towing
a
person
to
shore
and
was
swimming
with
nakwisi
in
tow
she
was
just
nearing
the
dock
where
nyoda
stood
watching
to
see
if
she
could
land
her
burden
when
sahwah
dove
off
the
high
tower
right
on
top
of
her
and
nakwisi
carrying
them
both
under
the
surface
and
breaking
up
the
test
nyoda
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
and
sent
sahwah
out
of
the
water
as
a
reminder
to
look
before
she
dove
the
next
time
sahwah
heart
was
nearly
broken
and
she
could
hardly
eat
her
dinner
she
and
gladys
were
washing
dishes
that
day
but
when
the
time
came
gladys
pleaded
a
headache
and
went
to
the
tent
to
lie
down
leaving
sahwah
to
do
them
alone
it
seemed
that
every
dish
in
camp
had
been
used
that
day
she
finished
at
last
all
tired
out
and
flung
herself
on
her
bed
resolved
not
to
move
until
rest
hour
was
over
and
not
then
if
she
did
feel
like
it
she
was
just
sinking
off
into
a
delicious
doze
when
gladys
reached
over
and
pulled
her
by
the
foot
what
do
you
want
said
sahwah
drowsily
come
on
take
me
for
a
ride
in
the
sponson
said
gladys
ca
it
rest
hour
answered
sahwah
what
of
it
said
gladys
let
go
anyway
everybody
asleep
they
never
know
the
difference
sahwah
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
horror
it
matter
whether
any
one
knows
it
or
not
she
said
stiffly
it
is
a
custom
of
the
winnebagos
to
go
boating
in
rest
hour
it
does
seem
to
be
a
custom
of
the
winnebagos
to
do
anything
they
want
to
said
gladys
sneeringly
you
girls
let
miss
kent
lead
you
around
by
the
nose
as
if
you
were
six
years
old
it
a
pity
if
girls
as
old
as
we
are
have
to
take
a
nap
after
dinner
like
babies
i
for
one
wo
stand
for
it
i
do
want
to
lie
down
for
an
hour
every
afternoon
and
i
not
going
to
do
it
so
there
if
you
had
any
spirit
you
rebel
too
but
you
have
you
just
like
wax
in
her
hands
if
she
told
you
to
go
bed
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
stay
there
you
do
it
i
dare
you
to
slip
out
and
go
for
a
boat
ride
with
me
now
i
dare
you
i
dare
you
sahwah
hair
nearly
stood
on
end
with
fury
at
this
attack
on
her
beloved
nyoda
dare
all
you
like
she
said
in
a
choking
voice
i
not
break
a
camp
rule
to
please
you
very
well
then
do
said
gladys
and
see
if
i
care
if
you
would
rather
abide
by
silly
old
rules
than
have
a
good
time
it
your
loss
not
mine
i
would
be
such
a
baby
she
went
back
to
her
bed
and
lay
down
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
every
few
seconds
she
would
look
over
at
sahwah
and
pronounce
the
word
baby
in
a
taunting
tone
sahwah
closed
her
eyes
resolutely
and
pretended
not
to
hear
her
she
was
filled
from
head
to
foot
with
contempt
for
gladys
sahwah
was
heedless
and
and
undiplomatic
but
in
matters
where
honor
was
concerned
she
was
true
blue
all
her
admiration
for
gladys
vanished
when
she
tried
to
lead
her
into
dishonor
as
she
lay
there
thinking
over
her
attempts
to
win
gladys
friendship
she
saw
clearly
how
gladys
had
been
working
her
all
this
time
getting
her
to
wait
on
her
hand
and
foot
and
in
return
treating
her
in
a
patronizing
manner
as
if
she
were
an
inferior
being
from
whom
such
service
was
no
more
than
due
her
rage
rose
at
the
very
thought
of
gladys
catch
me
doing
anything
for
her
again
she
muttered
to
herself
she
lay
very
still
with
her
eyes
closed
for
a
long
time
feigning
sleep
after
a
while
a
stealthy
rustle
from
gladys
bed
caught
her
ear
she
opened
one
eye
slightly
and
then
opened
both
very
wide
in
surprise
gladys
was
in
the
act
of
drawing
a
box
of
candy
from
under
her
blankets
opening
it
she
proceeded
to
eat
one
piece
after
another
sahwah
was
so
astonished
that
she
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
gladys
looked
in
her
direction
have
a
piece
of
candy
she
said
mockingly
holding
out
the
box
or
are
you
afraid
to
do
that
too
sahwah
disregarded
the
taunt
where
did
you
get
that
candy
she
asked
sternly
i
bought
it
down
in
the
village
miss
simplicity
answered
gladys
did
you
know
that
we
were
to
buy
candy
and
eat
it
between
meals
or
did
you
continued
sahwah
certainly
i
knew
it
was
against
the
rules
said
gladys
but
i
do
intend
to
have
any
one
dictate
to
me
whether
or
not
i
shall
eat
candy
i
eaten
candy
all
my
life
and
it
never
hurt
me
if
i
ca
eat
it
openly
i
eat
it
on
the
sly
but
i
will
eat
it
did
it
occur
to
you
that
it
dishonest
to
do
things
on
the
sly
like
that
said
sahwah
in
a
husky
voice
if
she
had
held
gladys
in
contempt
before
there
was
no
name
for
what
she
thought
of
her
now
who
says
it
dishonest
to
break
silly
rules
said
gladys
putting
another
piece
into
her
mouth
such
rules
were
made
to
be
broken
what
would
nyoda
say
asked
sahwah
i
do
care
what
she
says
said
gladys
recklessly
i
thought
you
admired
her
so
much
said
sahwah
remembering
how
gladys
was
constantly
fawning
on
nyoda
i
do
admire
her
more
than
any
of
you
said
gladys
loftily
but
that
no
sign
she
can
order
me
around
go
and
tell
her
if
you
like
old
busybody
tell
her
what
asked
nyoda
appearing
in
the
door
of
the
tent
that
i
buy
candy
in
the
village
and
keep
it
in
my
bed
to
eat
during
rest
hour
said
gladys
brazenly
nyoda
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
that
you
do
what
she
asked
gladys
held
up
the
box
nyoda
said
nothing
but
merely
looked
at
her
and
before
the
expression
in
her
eyes
gladys
wilted
and
was
covered
with
confusion
i
do
care
i
want
some
candy
she
said
looking
ready
to
burst
into
tears
why
did
you
wait
until
supper
time
and
pass
it
around
asked
nyoda
quietly
but
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
that
robbed
gladys
of
her
air
of
bravado
because
i
wanted
it
now
she
said
sulkily
gladys
said
nyoda
trying
to
conceal
her
disgust
at
this
untrustworthy
trait
revealed
in
the
character
of
her
charge
by
the
episode
have
you
any
idea
why
that
candy
rule
was
made
gladys
shook
her
head
it
was
made
said
nyoda
to
keep
me
from
dishonor
gladys
looked
at
her
uncomprehendingly
it
is
a
very
responsible
thing
continued
nyoda
to
take
a
group
of
girls
so
far
away
from
home
many
of
the
girls
mothers
were
unwilling
to
have
them
go
and
i
promised
every
one
of
them
on
my
honor
that
no
harm
should
come
to
their
girls
that
i
could
in
any
way
prevent
and
that
we
should
all
come
back
in
better
health
than
we
went
now
a
change
of
climate
and
drinking
water
is
hard
on
any
one
and
you
girls
have
enough
to
do
adjusting
your
systems
to
the
new
order
of
things
even
with
a
carefully
regulated
diet
eating
candy
between
meals
is
one
good
way
to
produce
an
upset
stomach
and
up
here
we
ca
take
any
chances
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
take
care
of
a
sick
person
in
camp
and
besides
think
of
all
the
fun
you
would
lose
so
when
we
were
discussing
the
difficulties
of
camping
out
for
so
long
we
all
agreed
willingly
and
cheerfully
to
live
on
a
strict
schedule
recommended
by
experienced
campers
and
to
run
no
risks
by
eating
candy
between
meals
so
you
see
that
the
rule
which
you
probably
consider
merely
a
piece
of
tyranny
on
my
part
is
not
my
rule
at
all
but
was
adopted
by
unanimous
consent
at
a
meeting
of
the
group
if
i
were
to
allow
you
to
eat
candy
between
meals
i
would
be
breaking
my
promise
to
your
parents
and
you
know
that
we
camp
fire
girls
have
taken
a
vow
to
be
trustworthy
gladys
flushed
and
hung
her
head
although
nyoda
had
made
no
reference
to
her
breaking
of
trust
nyoda
continued
you
of
all
the
girls
here
have
need
to
be
the
most
careful
you
are
the
least
robust
of
them
all
and
enter
into
our
sports
with
the
least
vigor
your
racket
stroke
is
weak
and
your
paddle
stroke
is
weak
and
exertion
which
does
not
affect
the
other
girls
at
all
leaves
you
exhausted
that
is
a
condition
of
which
you
should
be
ashamed
inasmuch
as
you
have
no
definite
ailment
on
to
health
is
only
another
form
of
trustworthy
for
it
means
taking
good
care
of
the
body
which
has
been
given
into
our
keeping
i
know
you
never
thought
about
it
in
just
that
way
and
broke
the
rule
because
you
saw
no
reason
for
it
not
because
you
have
no
sense
of
honor
and
now
about
this
candy
you
have
on
hand
i
will
ask
you
to
put
it
in
the
kitchen
where
it
will
keep
dry
and
pass
it
around
to
the
girls
at
meal
time
as
long
as
it
lasts
after
that
i
must
request
you
not
to
buy
any
more
even
to
eat
with
meals
we
have
candy
three
times
a
week
and
that
is
sufficient
nyoda
withdrew
from
the
tent
leaving
gladys
feeling
very
small
hinpoha
and
migwan
had
waked
in
time
to
hear
the
last
of
speech
and
saw
the
candy
and
while
they
were
too
polite
to
make
any
remarks
their
attitude
plainly
showed
their
disapproval
and
this
state
of
things
galled
gladys
more
than
nyoda
chiding
sahwah
with
a
fine
sense
of
charity
had
left
the
tent
when
nyoda
appeared
her
generous
nature
forbade
her
to
crow
over
a
fallen
foe
a
nature
walk
was
on
the
program
for
the
afternoon
but
gladys
feigned
a
headache
and
remained
at
home
somehow
i
do
feel
like
going
on
a
nature
walk
either
said
sahwah
when
they
were
ready
to
start
this
was
so
unusual
from
sahwah
who
was
generally
enthusiastic
about
everything
that
was
proposed
that
nyoda
looked
at
her
in
some
anxiety
do
you
feel
well
dear
she
asked
yes
i
feel
perfectly
well
said
sahwah
that
the
trouble
i
feel
too
well
to
go
on
a
nature
walk
feel
too
well
to
go
on
a
nature
walk
repeated
nyoda
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
do
know
said
sahwah
i
feel
so
full
of
of
something
that
i
like
to
wrestle
with
an
elephant
nyoda
understood
the
feeling
she
had
watched
sahwah
growing
irritation
all
day
long
and
knew
that
in
her
case
the
only
relief
would
be
strenuous
activity
then
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
stay
at
home
she
said
lightly
you
might
do
some
damage
to
us
peaceful
citizens
by
the
way
have
you
ever
swum
as
far
as
blueberry
island
it
a
mile
i
think
that
ought
to
work
off
some
of
your
superfluous
energy
you
have
special
permission
to
go
in
this
afternoon
when
you
get
there
wait
until
i
come
for
you
in
the
launch
we
can
keep
our
eye
on
you
from
the
road
while
you
are
swimming
sahwah
jumped
for
joy
and
ran
to
get
into
her
bathing
suit
the
cool
water
closed
around
her
limbs
like
the
caress
of
a
loving
hand
and
her
irritation
vanished
like
magic
water
was
sahwah
element
and
as
she
propelled
herself
gracefully
across
the
sparkling
lake
feeling
the
absolute
mastery
of
her
muscles
changing
regularly
from
left
to
right
in
her
side
stroke
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
mermaid
by
some
neckan
of
the
deep
she
reached
blueberry
island
in
good
time
and
climbing
up
on
the
rocky
shore
sat
down
in
the
sun
to
dry
meanwhile
gladys
was
not
having
anywhere
near
such
a
glorious
time
she
tossed
on
her
bed
for
a
long
time
feeling
more
sorry
for
herself
every
minute
she
still
thought
nyoda
explanation
of
the
candy
rule
a
weak
excuse
for
an
act
of
tyranny
and
was
furious
at
the
thought
of
having
been
caught
in
an
undignified
position
the
tears
which
she
had
managed
to
hold
back
in
front
of
nyoda
came
now
and
she
cried
herself
into
a
genuine
headache
but
it
was
all
there
was
no
real
sorrow
for
her
fault
she
considered
herself
the
most
abused
girl
in
the
world
deserted
by
her
parents
disliked
by
girls
whom
she
considered
beneath
her
and
deprived
of
her
rights
by
a
young
woman
who
had
no
real
authority
over
her
i
bet
the
other
girls
eat
candy
between
meals
too
she
said
to
herself
viciously
only
they
too
clever
to
get
found
out
i
would
have
been
found
out
either
if
it
had
been
for
that
snippy
little
sahwah
making
a
fuss
she
worked
herself
into
a
perfect
fury
and
blamed
sahwah
for
all
of
her
troubles
give
a
whole
lot
to
get
even
with
her
she
said
to
herself
and
immediately
began
looking
around
the
tent
for
something
of
sahwah
which
she
could
damage
the
only
thing
in
evidence
was
her
tennis
racket
and
gladys
took
it
out
and
deliberately
put
a
stone
through
it
then
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
and
thoroughly
homesick
and
miserable
she
sat
down
and
began
a
letter
to
her
father
begging
him
to
send
for
her
immediately
dear
papa
she
wrote
if
you
only
knew
what
a
dreadful
place
this
is
you
would
not
leave
me
here
another
day
the
girls
are
very
rude
and
horrid
and
low
class
they
are
continually
fighting
and
playing
rough
jokes
on
each
other
and
especially
on
me
i
do
like
miss
kent
as
well
as
you
said
i
would
she
makes
me
go
in
bathing
until
i
all
tired
out
and
cold
and
tries
to
make
me
swim
when
it
impossible
for
me
to
learn
she
takes
me
out
beyond
my
depth
and
ducks
me
under
when
i
do
make
my
hands
go
right
she
treats
me
as
if
i
were
a
baby
and
wo
trust
me
out
of
her
sight
it
seems
they
have
a
rule
here
about
not
eating
candy
between
meals
and
i
did
know
it
and
i
bought
some
and
ate
it
and
she
called
me
a
sneak
before
all
the
girls
and
made
me
throw
the
candy
into
the
lake
i
am
very
miserable
and
sick
most
of
the
time
as
we
do
get
enough
to
eat
and
what
we
do
get
is
good
i
always
cold
at
night
and
they
often
let
it
rain
right
in
on
our
beds
if
you
do
send
for
me
right
away
i
may
get
sick
and
die
before
very
long
your
miserable
daughter
gladys
aunt
sally
is
going
to
atlantic
city
in
august
may
i
go
with
her
she
gave
the
letter
to
the
captain
of
the
steamer
when
he
stopped
to
bring
the
supplies
and
then
sat
down
on
the
dock
and
stared
moodily
out
over
the
lake
she
was
lonesome
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
stayed
home
of
her
own
accord
she
resented
the
fact
that
the
girls
had
gone
off
and
left
her
the
canoes
lay
side
by
side
on
the
beach
and
gladys
was
seized
with
a
fancy
to
get
into
one
and
go
gliding
out
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
lake
she
was
not
allowed
in
a
canoe
because
she
had
not
taken
the
swimming
test
but
she
considered
this
another
piece
of
tyranny
on
nyoda
part
she
could
paddle
pretty
well
as
sahwah
had
taught
her
to
handle
the
sponson
and
she
saw
no
reason
at
all
why
she
could
enjoy
a
quiet
canoe
ride
up
and
down
the
beach
while
no
one
was
around
to
interfere
i
stay
near
shore
she
told
herself
as
she
laid
hold
of
one
of
the
canoes
and
launched
it
as
she
had
seen
the
girls
do
she
managed
to
seat
herself
in
the
right
end
and
pushed
off
from
the
shore
it
was
more
fun
even
than
she
had
imagined
and
the
canoe
seemed
so
light
in
comparison
to
the
sponson
that
she
sent
it
flying
through
the
water
with
little
effort
i
bet
keeping
me
out
of
the
canoes
on
purpose
so
they
have
more
use
of
them
themselves
she
thought
ungraciously
and
it
not
because
i
ca
swim
at
all
that
was
a
safe
rule
to
make
when
i
the
only
one
who
ca
swim
and
they
my
own
canoes
gladys
edged
a
little
farther
out
from
the
shore
then
a
little
farther
and
a
little
farther
the
end
of
the
canoe
swung
around
until
it
pointed
directly
out
across
the
lake
and
gladys
kept
on
paddling
in
the
way
it
pointed
when
she
had
reached
a
distance
about
halfway
between
blueberry
island
and
the
dock
she
noticed
with
terror
that
the
canoe
was
leaking
she
had
not
been
in
the
group
when
nyoda
had
warned
them
about
not
using
the
one
canoe
for
several
days
and
as
luck
would
have
it
the
canoe
she
picked
out
was
the
very
one
which
sahwah
had
grounded
on
the
rock
the
gash
was
opening
again
and
the
canoe
was
filling
with
water
helpless
from
fright
gladys
dropped
her
paddle
overboard
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
after
one
wild
look
at
the
distant
shore
it
seemed
to
her
like
a
swift
judgment
from
heaven
for
her
outrageous
conduct
that
day
sahwah
grown
weary
of
sitting
in
the
sun
doing
nothing
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
camp
dock
to
watch
for
the
putting
out
of
the
launch
no
launch
was
forthcoming
but
she
saw
a
canoe
gliding
out
from
the
dock
something
must
be
the
matter
with
the
launch
and
nyoda
coming
for
me
in
a
canoe
thought
sahwah
how
slowly
she
is
paddling
it
will
take
her
an
age
to
get
here
sahwah
waited
a
little
while
and
then
slid
off
the
rocks
into
the
water
i
swim
out
and
meet
her
she
said
to
herself
when
she
had
gone
about
half
the
distance
she
saw
that
it
was
not
nyoda
in
the
canoe
but
gladys
and
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
escaped
from
her
lips
coming
nearer
yet
she
saw
that
gladys
was
in
distress
and
had
dropped
her
paddle
overboard
and
she
doubled
her
speed
shooting
through
the
water
like
a
speed
boat
raising
up
her
head
once
she
shouted
to
attract
gladys
attention
gladys
evidently
did
not
hear
her
for
she
did
not
turn
around
when
she
was
nearly
there
sahwah
saw
that
the
canoe
was
sinking
and
with
a
mighty
spurt
she
reached
it
just
as
it
settled
to
the
water
edge
and
gladys
with
a
wild
scream
fell
into
the
lake
sahwah
caught
her
by
the
hair
as
she
came
up
and
held
her
head
out
of
water
what
did
you
take
a
canoe
out
for
you
goose
she
sputtered
you
deserve
to
drown
the
canoe
had
not
sunk
entirely
yet
and
sahwah
thought
that
if
she
could
turn
it
over
keel
up
it
would
be
all
right
until
they
could
come
for
it
so
turning
gladys
over
on
her
back
she
bade
her
float
while
she
kept
one
hand
on
her
to
keep
her
above
water
and
reached
out
for
the
canoe
with
the
other
gladys
struggled
and
choked
but
sahwah
paid
no
attention
to
her
for
she
knew
that
she
was
safe
and
could
not
get
a
strangle
hold
on
her
grasping
one
end
of
the
canoe
she
tried
to
turn
it
over
at
first
it
would
not
move
and
so
sahwah
exerted
all
her
strength
in
a
mighty
push
the
canoe
stood
partly
on
end
and
then
came
down
with
a
crashing
thud
on
her
outstretched
arm
an
instant
of
numbness
was
followed
by
the
most
excruciating
pain
and
the
arm
sank
limply
through
the
water
sahwah
knew
that
it
was
broken
but
even
then
her
presence
of
mind
did
not
desert
her
shoving
gladys
out
ahead
of
her
with
her
good
arm
she
propelled
herself
with
her
legs
swimming
on
her
back
and
slowly
they
began
to
move
toward
the
distant
shore
the
half
mile
that
was
nothing
to
sahwah
ordinarily
now
became
an
endless
stretch
the
pain
in
her
arm
made
her
feel
faint
and
her
limbs
tired
from
her
long
swim
seemed
suddenly
to
have
turned
into
lead
the
clouds
above
turned
black
then
blood
red
then
every
color
of
the
rainbow
strange
lights
and
shadows
danced
in
front
of
her
eyes
and
there
were
strange
noises
in
her
ears
her
breath
came
in
long
sobbing
gasps
the
arm
that
was
holding
gladys
became
cramped
and
weak
but
there
was
no
relief
draw
kick
close
draw
kick
close
the
monotonous
rhythm
beat
itself
into
her
brain
draw
kick
close
throb
throb
throb
would
the
nightmare
never
come
to
an
end
through
the
sound
of
strange
voices
that
were
echoing
in
her
ears
sahwah
heard
a
cry
that
sounded
like
nyoda
and
then
darkness
settled
around
her
and
her
efforts
ceased
nyoda
coming
down
to
untie
the
launch
reached
the
dock
just
as
sahwah
and
gladys
came
alongside
of
it
and
held
out
her
hand
to
help
gladys
up
she
thought
she
was
being
towed
for
fun
sahwah
you
naughty
girl
what
did
you
swim
all
the
way
home
for
she
began
and
then
gasped
in
astonishment
as
sahwah
stiffened
out
in
the
water
and
went
down
she
grasped
her
by
the
collar
as
she
came
up
and
pulled
her
out
on
the
dock
limp
and
dripping
what
does
this
mean
she
asked
gladys
she
towed
me
in
when
the
canoe
went
down
said
gladys
her
teeth
chattering
with
fright
she
broke
her
arm
and
held
me
up
with
the
other
while
she
swam
with
her
legs
gladys
knees
gave
way
and
she
sank
down
on
the
dock
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sahwah
the
sunfish
the
lover
of
maiden
bravery
the
envier
of
heroines
was
the
greatest
of
them
all
and
knew
it
not
chapter
viii
a
serenade
is
she
dead
cried
the
girls
gathering
around
with
frightened
faces
gladys
caught
the
word
dead
and
her
heart
turned
to
water
within
her
the
horror
of
the
afternoon
experience
had
made
her
see
herself
in
her
true
light
and
she
was
overwhelmed
with
shame
at
the
sight
this
sahwah
whom
she
had
twitted
as
being
a
coward
and
a
baby
because
she
would
not
break
her
word
was
made
of
the
stuff
that
heroes
are
made
of
and
had
probably
given
her
brave
life
to
save
her
worthless
one
looking
back
over
the
weeks
she
had
spent
in
camp
she
could
not
remember
one
instance
where
she
had
done
anybody
a
favor
or
entered
with
enthusiasm
into
their
plans
while
sahwah
unselfish
devotion
to
her
during
these
last
days
smote
her
with
sharp
remorse
in
the
new
light
she
suddenly
saw
the
vast
difference
between
herself
and
these
other
girls
verily
they
were
not
of
her
class
because
they
were
far
above
it
how
could
she
ever
take
her
hands
from
her
face
and
look
at
them
again
if
sahwah
dies
she
sobbed
to
herself
i
kill
myself
too
meanwhile
nyoda
was
working
hard
to
bring
sahwah
around
it
was
not
a
case
of
reviving
a
drowned
person
for
sahwah
had
swallowed
no
water
she
had
fainted
from
exhaustion
nyoda
rubbed
her
and
held
salts
to
her
nose
and
sahwah
finally
opened
her
eyes
did
i
jump
off
in
my
sleep
she
asked
dreamily
no
my
dear
you
did
not
said
nyoda
you
a
real
heroine
this
time
and
no
mistake
where
gladys
cried
sahwah
wildly
starting
up
suddenly
and
falling
back
with
a
groan
she
all
right
said
nyoda
without
looking
around
sahwah
was
carried
up
the
hill
and
rolled
in
warm
blankets
and
put
to
bed
with
a
hot
drink
while
nyoda
sped
the
launch
across
the
lake
for
the
nearest
doctor
vell
vich
von
of
de
ladies
has
been
celebrating
dis
time
he
said
with
his
german
accent
as
he
entered
the
tent
he
was
the
same
doctor
who
had
come
to
look
at
migwan
knee
a
broken
arm
ach
so
he
said
patting
the
injured
member
and
for
vy
did
you
not
set
it
right
away
yourself
like
dat
missis
migvan
did
he
asked
she
vas
a
hustler
now
he
talked
on
jovially
all
the
while
he
set
the
bone
and
sahwah
stuffed
the
corners
of
the
pillow
into
her
mouth
so
that
no
sound
should
escape
her
vell
vell
he
continued
dropped
a
canoe
on
her
funny
bone
and
kicked
herself
all
de
vay
across
de
lake
now
and
pushed
anoder
lady
by
de
neck
i
gif
it
up
and
now
missis
sahvah
he
said
holding
up
one
finger
at
her
you
lie
on
de
bed
until
i
say
you
should
get
out
you
could
get
a
fever
pushing
ladies
around
by
de
neck
now
he
said
looking
around
de
lady
vot
got
drowned
vere
is
she
the
girls
searched
through
the
camp
for
gladys
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
he
was
obliged
to
depart
without
seeing
her
far
out
in
the
woods
gladys
wandered
about
distractedly
until
her
anxiety
regarding
sahwah
drove
her
back
to
camp
to
face
the
girls
and
find
out
bow
she
was
near
the
tent
she
stumbled
against
something
on
the
ground
and
stooping
to
see
what
it
was
found
the
racket
on
which
she
had
vented
her
fury
that
afternoon
the
sight
of
it
nearly
made
her
i
get
her
another
she
resolved
the
best
that
money
can
buy
hers
was
only
a
cheap
one
after
all
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
enter
the
tent
but
she
finally
crept
in
hoping
to
remain
unnoticed
and
hear
how
sahwah
was
getting
along
nyoda
looked
up
as
she
came
in
and
pitied
her
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
come
in
gladys
she
said
softly
and
gladys
approached
how
is
she
began
and
then
her
voice
broke
fine
and
dandy
said
sahwah
herself
rather
weakly
the
fever
that
the
doctor
had
predicted
was
rising
and
her
lips
were
dry
nyoda
feared
that
the
presence
of
gladys
would
excite
sahwah
and
led
her
out
of
the
tent
now
gladys
she
said
sitting
down
on
the
steps
of
the
shack
i
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
that
happened
this
afternoon
how
did
it
come
that
you
were
out
in
a
canoe
and
had
to
be
rescued
gladys
told
a
straight
story
not
sparing
herself
in
the
least
she
told
about
the
dreadful
mood
she
had
been
in
that
afternoon
after
the
girls
had
gone
away
how
she
had
broken
racket
and
then
filled
with
a
very
devil
of
rebellion
had
taken
out
one
of
the
canoes
it
happened
to
be
the
leaky
one
and
her
punishment
overtook
her
swift
as
the
wings
of
a
bird
she
had
given
up
all
hope
when
sahwah
had
appeared
magically
from
somewhere
and
towed
her
in
in
spite
of
her
broken
arm
face
was
crimson
with
shame
when
she
told
how
she
had
tried
to
make
sahwah
take
her
out
in
the
sponson
during
rest
hour
and
had
called
her
a
coward
because
she
refused
she
told
nyoda
everything
except
the
letter
she
had
written
to
her
father
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
that
it
lay
on
her
conscience
like
a
lump
of
lead
nyoda
said
very
little
about
the
matter
and
did
not
upbraid
her
at
all
she
saw
that
gladys
sins
had
come
down
on
her
head
in
a
manner
which
would
make
a
very
deep
impression
and
that
gladys
would
emerge
from
the
experience
a
sadder
and
wiser
girl
i
have
been
a
very
good
camper
nyoda
said
gladys
humbly
but
i
going
to
try
to
be
after
this
i
know
you
will
said
nyoda
putting
her
arm
around
her
and
you
are
going
to
succeed
too
and
now
let
go
and
see
how
sahwah
is
sahwah
was
tossing
on
the
bed
and
muttering
when
they
came
in
she
had
a
high
fever
and
was
living
over
again
her
strenuous
escapade
of
the
afternoon
she
cried
aloud
that
the
shore
was
running
away
from
her
that
the
clouds
were
tumbling
down
on
her
that
a
big
fish
had
a
hold
of
her
arm
this
rock
i
am
pushing
against
she
moaned
is
so
heavy
i
shall
never
get
around
it
nyoda
gave
her
the
fever
medicine
left
by
the
doctor
and
she
sank
into
a
heavy
sleep
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
she
alternately
raved
and
slept
nyoda
fetched
the
doctor
again
the
next
day
and
he
predicted
that
sahwah
would
soon
be
better
she
is
a
strong
von
dat
missis
sahvah
he
said
she
has
bones
like
iron
a
weak
von
vould
maybe
haf
brain
fever
but
not
she
i
do
tink
nor
did
sahwah
disappoint
him
she
had
a
constitution
like
a
cat
and
her
active
outdoor
life
kept
her
blood
in
perfect
condition
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
began
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
the
fever
during
the
second
night
she
woke
up
feeling
delightfully
cool
and
comfortable
the
fever
had
left
her
sometime
during
sleep
the
moon
was
setting
over
the
lake
making
a
long
golden
streak
across
the
water
sahwah
smiled
happily
at
the
peaceful
scene
then
she
became
aware
of
a
figure
crouching
on
the
floor
beside
her
bed
it
was
gladys
sitting
on
a
low
stool
beside
her
keeping
watch
hello
gladys
she
said
weakly
but
cheerfully
gladys
started
up
do
you
really
know
me
she
said
joyfully
sure
i
know
you
said
sahwah
why
should
i
you
did
yesterday
you
know
said
gladys
did
my
arm
make
me
so
sick
asked
sahwah
feeling
gingerly
of
the
white
bandage
and
moving
her
feet
to
make
sure
that
they
were
not
similarly
adorned
gladys
nodded
have
you
been
sitting
here
all
night
asked
sahwah
yes
said
gladys
nyoda
sat
up
last
night
but
i
made
her
go
to
bed
she
is
here
in
my
bed
and
i
to
call
her
if
she
needed
let
her
sleep
said
sahwah
softly
and
you
go
back
to
bed
too
i
wo
need
anything
really
i
wo
i
feel
fine
now
gladys
shook
her
head
resolutely
i
promised
to
sit
up
with
you
and
i
going
to
keep
my
promise
you
see
i
can
be
trustworthy
sometimes
o
sahwah
she
cried
burying
her
face
in
the
blankets
how
can
i
ever
repay
you
for
what
you
have
done
do
try
said
sahwah
cheerfully
what
a
miserable
sneak
you
must
think
me
continued
gladys
o
shucks
said
sahwah
who
hated
scenes
forget
it
start
all
over
from
the
beginning
are
you
really
willing
to
give
me
another
chance
said
gladys
joyfully
sure
said
sahwah
here
my
hand
on
it
she
slid
her
hand
out
from
under
the
covers
and
caught
gladys
in
a
warm
clasp
she
fell
asleep
soon
after
that
and
did
not
waken
again
during
the
night
but
gladys
sat
beside
her
until
morning
watching
her
slightest
movement
and
the
camp
fire
leaven
was
beginning
to
work
in
her
and
she
was
learning
to
fulfil
the
law
which
says
give
service
the
girls
were
filled
with
delight
the
next
morning
to
hear
sahwah
calling
for
her
breakfast
in
her
natural
voice
and
clucking
to
the
chipmunks
as
of
old
migwan
sped
to
the
woods
for
a
bouquet
of
the
brightest
flowers
she
could
find
to
adorn
the
tent
while
hinpoha
clattered
around
the
kitchen
concocting
delicacies
gladys
hovered
over
her
like
a
fond
grandmama
brushing
her
hair
washing
her
face
and
plumping
up
the
pillows
and
the
rest
of
the
winnebagos
looked
in
every
five
minutes
to
see
how
she
felt
sahwah
had
never
had
so
much
attention
before
in
her
life
her
slightest
want
was
attended
to
as
soon
as
expressed
the
suffering
of
the
last
two
days
was
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
joys
of
being
a
heroine
and
sahwah
drank
deep
of
the
cup
that
was
offered
her
this
tent
is
getting
famous
said
hinpoha
as
she
moved
about
setting
it
to
rights
there
are
already
two
heroines
in
it
we
have
to
change
the
name
from
to
lodge
quite
a
good
idea
that
and
picking
up
a
piece
of
she
painted
the
name
on
it
in
large
letters
and
tacked
it
to
the
tent
pole
now
she
continued
we
name
your
bed
roost
and
migwan
cradle
and
she
made
two
more
signs
and
hung
them
on
the
foot
rails
of
the
beds
sahwah
sat
up
for
an
hour
in
the
afternoon
and
gladys
danced
for
her
amusement
the
girls
gasped
with
wonder
and
delight
for
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
she
was
as
light
on
her
feet
as
thistledown
and
as
graceful
as
a
swaying
rose
nyoda
watched
her
with
keen
pleasure
but
it
was
not
her
twinkling
feet
nor
the
artistic
posing
of
her
limbs
that
held
her
attention
but
the
new
expression
on
her
face
the
old
selfish
blase
look
was
gone
and
her
features
were
lit
up
by
an
eager
smile
that
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
curved
up
the
corners
of
her
pretty
mouth
again
the
leaven
was
at
work
in
her
and
she
was
fulfilling
the
law
of
the
camp
fire
which
is
to
seek
beauty
sahwah
slept
again
after
that
and
gladys
called
all
the
girls
together
around
the
piano
in
the
shack
where
they
stayed
until
supper
time
singing
softly
under
gladys
direction
sahwah
had
finished
her
supper
and
had
been
made
comfortable
for
the
night
and
lay
staring
out
into
the
gathering
darkness
and
wondering
where
the
girls
were
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
neither
could
she
hear
their
voices
then
all
at
once
she
heard
the
sound
of
singing
wafted
up
from
the
lake
it
was
stars
of
the
summer
night
sung
exquisitely
in
three
parts
sahwah
could
hardly
believe
it
was
the
winnebagos
so
perfect
was
the
harmony
this
was
followed
by
i
would
that
my
love
sung
by
gladys
and
nyoda
sahwah
drew
a
long
rapturous
breath
at
the
beautiful
blending
of
alto
and
soprano
she
was
passionately
fond
of
music
then
gladys
sang
come
where
my
love
lies
dreaming
her
clear
high
voice
ringing
over
the
water
like
a
flute
the
notes
died
lingeringly
away
and
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
soft
chugging
of
the
launch
as
it
bore
the
serenaders
back
to
shore
sahwah
composed
herself
to
sleep
the
melodies
she
had
just
heard
still
echoing
in
her
ears
a
soft
rustling
outside
the
tent
door
made
her
open
her
eyes
and
she
started
in
surprise
at
the
fairy
scene
which
was
being
enacted
there
in
the
open
grassy
space
before
the
tent
figures
were
passing
back
and
forth
and
winding
in
and
out
in
the
mazes
of
a
dance
so
silently
they
moved
they
scarcely
seemed
flesh
and
blood
but
rather
a
band
of
woodland
nymphs
performing
their
nightly
revels
there
was
one
figure
among
them
who
was
lighter
and
airier
than
all
the
rest
and
she
darted
in
and
out
between
the
lines
and
round
and
round
them
like
a
butterfly
fluttering
around
a
bed
of
tossing
flowers
at
last
after
joining
hands
and
whirling
madly
in
a
circle
they
broke
ranks
and
vanished
among
the
trees
sahwah
tried
to
applaud
but
could
not
manage
it
and
shouted
her
appreciation
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
which
brought
the
whole
troupe
to
the
edge
of
the
tent
to
bow
and
curtsey
nyoda
drew
them
away
again
immediately
however
declaring
that
it
was
high
time
sahwah
went
to
sleep
long
after
the
other
girls
lay
motionless
in
their
beds
gladys
was
wakeful
and
restless
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
spent
the
entire
day
in
the
service
of
others
she
had
no
peace
nyoda
had
praised
her
warmly
for
arranging
the
serenade
and
dance
but
this
only
aggravated
the
trouble
she
was
having
in
her
mind
namely
the
letter
which
she
had
written
her
father
the
horrid
lying
epistle
in
which
she
had
cruelly
wronged
nyoda
and
all
these
wonderful
girls
he
must
have
it
by
now
and
would
undoubtedly
send
for
her
immediately
and
furthermore
he
would
probably
make
all
the
others
go
home
too
at
this
thought
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
there
was
only
one
thing
that
could
prevent
it
and
that
was
for
her
to
write
him
another
letter
contradicting
the
first
it
sounded
easy
to
say
it
but
it
would
mean
that
her
father
would
know
she
had
told
an
untruth
and
she
shrank
back
miserably
from
the
revelation
she
admired
her
father
and
cared
much
for
his
opinion
of
her
and
to
be
branded
as
a
liar
in
his
sight
was
more
than
she
could
bear
he
would
never
believe
her
again
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
of
breaking
up
this
jolly
summer
camp
and
sending
the
girls
home
unhappy
made
the
chills
run
down
her
back
and
the
perspiration
start
out
on
her
forehead
sahwah
and
her
swimming
could
she
have
the
heart
to
separate
them
her
other
indebtedness
to
sahwah
she
dared
not
even
think
of
wherever
she
turned
her
face
she
saw
nyoda
trusting
eyes
looking
into
hers
with
a
smile
as
they
had
done
that
very
evening
could
she
bear
to
cloud
them
over
with
grief
and
disappointment
she
was
just
beginning
to
rise
in
nyoda
good
graces
could
she
bear
to
fall
forever
the
hours
dragged
wakefully
and
her
thoughts
tortured
her
like
searing
irons
in
all
her
life
gladys
had
never
done
the
hard
thing
when
there
was
an
easier
alternative
and
the
struggle
between
the
two
forces
in
her
was
a
mortal
one
but
the
constant
example
of
unselfishness
which
the
girls
had
set
for
her
all
summer
had
had
its
effect
and
by
morning
the
balance
had
swung
over
to
the
side
of
and
she
was
fully
resolved
to
write
the
letter
which
would
make
her
father
despise
her
she
rose
as
soon
as
it
was
light
brought
out
her
writing
materials
and
with
an
unfaltering
pen
wrote
the
sentences
which
branded
her
with
dishonor
it
was
the
most
difficult
letter
she
had
ever
written
but
she
kept
on
steadily
to
the
end
and
sealed
and
addressed
it
as
the
rising
bugle
blew
when
it
was
all
over
a
load
seemed
lifted
from
her
heart
and
breakfast
was
the
jolliest
meal
she
had
eaten
for
some
time
for
the
last
three
days
her
meals
had
been
nightmares
the
happy
chatter
of
the
girls
nearly
maddened
her
when
she
thought
that
it
would
soon
be
hushed
and
she
had
done
the
deed
which
was
to
silence
it
she
could
not
look
a
single
girl
in
the
face
and
her
food
choked
her
but
this
morning
all
that
was
over
she
joined
in
making
plans
for
future
trips
with
enthusiasm
for
she
felt
that
she
had
a
right
to
whatever
would
be
the
consequences
of
her
confession
to
her
father
all
the
suffering
would
be
borne
by
her
alone
and
she
had
nothing
more
on
her
conscience
feeling
curiously
she
ran
down
to
the
dock
to
give
the
letter
to
the
steamer
captain
nyoda
had
already
received
the
incoming
mail
and
was
distributing
it
here
gladys
something
for
you
she
said
handing
her
an
envelope
at
the
sight
of
it
gladys
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
dock
it
was
the
very
letter
she
had
written
to
her
father
on
that
memorable
afternoon
it
had
missed
her
father
in
his
travels
and
been
returned
to
her
what
the
matter
gladys
have
you
seen
a
ghost
asked
hinpoha
as
gladys
stood
staring
at
the
envelope
nothing
said
gladys
and
sped
up
the
path
clutching
the
two
letters
in
her
hand
i
did
deserve
it
she
panted
as
she
reached
the
shelter
of
the
woods
some
good
angel
had
me
under
its
wing
that
time
for
sure
she
tore
both
letters
into
bits
and
then
burned
them
and
scattered
the
ashes
to
the
winds
then
taking
her
knife
she
cut
a
letter
l
in
the
bark
of
the
tree
under
which
she
stood
and
pierced
it
with
an
arrow
to
signify
that
a
letter
can
do
as
much
harm
as
an
arrow
every
time
she
passed
that
tree
she
saw
the
mark
and
renewed
her
vow
never
to
write
another
letter
in
anger
the
next
mail
did
carry
another
letter
to
her
father
but
its
composing
cost
gladys
no
pain
it
contained
an
enthusiastic
account
of
her
rescue
by
sahwah
and
then
she
went
on
to
tell
what
a
good
time
she
was
having
and
what
wonderful
girls
the
winnebagos
were
she
ended
up
with
the
statement
that
they
had
such
good
eats
here
that
she
never
knew
when
to
stop
and
had
already
gained
five
pounds
she
also
sent
to
portland
for
a
new
racket
for
sahwah
paying
eight
dollars
for
it
she
did
not
ask
her
father
for
the
money
but
took
the
whole
amount
out
of
her
own
allowance
sahwah
was
up
now
and
running
around
the
camp
as
lively
as
ever
in
spite
of
her
splinted
arm
is
it
blessed
luck
that
it
my
left
one
she
declared
over
and
over
again
and
does
interfere
much
with
what
i
want
to
do
she
insisted
on
taking
her
morning
dip
with
the
rest
of
them
although
of
course
she
could
neither
swim
nor
dive
she
waded
out
to
her
waist
and
with
her
good
hand
managed
to
splash
the
water
over
her
chest
and
head
this
proceeding
generally
filled
her
with
profound
disgust
when
she
saw
the
others
jumping
in
with
a
grand
gurgle
and
splash
but
it
was
better
than
staying
out
of
the
water
altogether
but
the
greatest
phenomenon
in
the
water
just
now
was
the
way
gladys
was
learning
to
swim
thoroughly
ashamed
of
her
backwardness
in
this
matter
she
made
up
her
mind
once
for
all
that
she
was
going
to
overcome
her
fear
of
the
water
and
let
herself
be
helped
of
late
the
girls
had
about
given
up
trying
to
teach
her
she
confided
her
determination
to
nyoda
and
asked
her
to
be
patient
with
her
a
little
while
longer
nyoda
overjoyed
at
this
sudden
show
of
spirit
took
her
under
her
wing
immediately
gladys
struck
out
bravely
lost
her
balance
and
went
under
came
up
blind
and
strangling
blew
the
water
out
of
her
nose
and
laughed
and
then
went
at
it
again
she
repeated
the
performance
more
than
a
dozen
times
and
every
time
she
went
down
she
came
up
more
determined
than
ever
to
master
that
stroke
at
the
end
of
the
swimming
hour
she
had
taken
six
strokes
in
succession
with
nyoda
just
barely
supporting
her
the
next
day
nyoda
began
by
holding
her
up
and
then
when
her
arms
and
legs
were
working
rhythmically
slyly
withdrew
her
hand
and
let
her
go
alone
gladys
went
a
dozen
strokes
before
she
perceived
that
nyoda
had
let
go
of
her
she
progressed
so
much
that
day
that
the
next
swimming
period
nyoda
considered
it
unnecessary
to
help
her
at
all
and
let
her
swim
up
and
down
the
beach
by
herself
and
practise
for
distance
until
she
could
take
the
test
sahwah
no
longer
had
the
doctor
come
over
to
see
her
as
this
took
a
great
deal
of
his
time
but
went
across
the
lake
in
the
launch
to
his
office
to
have
the
splints
looked
after
vell
missis
sahvah
he

these
occasions

he
always
exclaimed
in
delight
at
the
progress

eloquently

up
his
deep
laugh
boomed
out
pleasantly
at
his
own
joke
on
another
occasion
he
led
them
with
an
air
of
great
mystery
into
the
kitchen
of
his
house
and
showed
them
a
basket
wherein
five
kittens
were
lying
on
a
soft
bed
he
sat
down
and
took
all
five
of
them
into
his
lap
they
scampered
all
over
him
up
and
down
his
arms
on
top
of
his
head
up
and
down
his
legs
while
he
laughed
heartily
at
their
antics
he
shouted
with
glee
when
one
of
them
darted
a
furry
paw
into
his
open
mouth

nyoda

and
sahwah
picked
out
the
liveliest
one
which
was
coal
black
from
his
nose
to
the
tip
of
his
tail
vait
a
minute
said
the
doctor
when
they
were
about
to
start
and
after
fumbling
in
a
drawer
he
produced
a
red
ribbon
with
a
little
bell
attached
dere
now
you
can
find
him
in
de
dark
he
said
tying
it
round
the
kitten
neck
the
girls
were
enchanted
with
the
new
pet
and
promptly
christened
it
kitty
wohelo
playing
with
it
whiled
away
many
a
tedious
hour
for
sahwah
when
she
could
not
join
in
the
sports
with
the
other
girls
one
morning
the
steamer
stopped
at
the
dock
and
unloaded
two
express
packages
of
enormous
size
both
addressed
to
sahwah
what
on
earth
can
it
be
she
said
i
do
know
a
soul
who
would
be
sending
me
anything
by
express
there
was
a
letter
for
her
in
the
mail
and
she
opened
this
first
it
was
from
father
and
read
i
am
sending
you
by
express
a
few
trifles
i
picked
up
among
the
indians
here
in
gratitude
for
the
service
you
rendered
my
daughter
gladys
on
the
of
july
may
you
live
a
hundred
years
and
wear
every
one
of
them
out
the
first
of
the
trifles
was
a
pair
of
indian
moccasins
made
of
finest
doe
skin
and
elaborately
beaded
then
came
a
variety
of
reed
and
birch
baskets
of
different
shapes
and
sizes
most
of
these
were
filled
with
strings
of
wampum
arrow
heads
pieces
of
bead
work
and
other
indian
curios
under
the
baskets
was
an
indian
girl
costume
made
of
doe
skin
with
leggings
to
match
the
next
thing
that
came
to
light
was
a
large
muff
of
finest
black
fox
fur
and
another
package
contained
the
neckpiece
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
were
a
sealskin
cap
a
hunting
knife
in
a
soft
leather
case
a
small
winchester
rifle
and
a
pair
of
fine
hockey
skates
with
shoes
attached
sahwah
rendered
speechless
by
this
sudden
rain
of
presents
could
only
hop
up
and
down
for
joy
as
each
new
treasure
was
brought
to
light
but
if
the
contents
of
the
first
box
took
her
breath
away
when
she
saw
what
was
in
the
other
her
delight
knew
no
bounds
it
was
a
long
narrow
crate
built
of
wooden
slats
and
careful
opening
revealed
a
birchbark
canoe
big
enough
to
paddle
on
the
lake
its
sides
were
decorated
with
indian
craft
work
and
in
it
lay
two
paddles
it
took
almost
physical
restraint
to
keep
sahwah
from
launching
it
right
then
and
there
as
she
was
and
trying
it
out
only
the
promise
of
a
grand
ceremony
of
launching
when
she
could
use
her
arm
again
comforted
her
for
the
delay
one
morning
not
long
afterward
gladys
announced
modestly
that
she
thought
she
could
take
the
swimming
test
nyoda
and
hinpoha
got
into
the
sponson
and
the
three
set
out
gladys
swimming
alongside
the
boat
all
fear
of
deep
water
had
left
her
now
and
she
moved
along
easily
and
swiftly
the
first
half
of
the
distance
was
covered
without
difficulty
and
then
she
began
to
tire
even
a
vaulting
ambition
can
not
supply
a
powerful
body
on
short
notice
her
breath
grew
short
and
the
water
began
to
run
into
her
throat
and
choke
her
she
struggled
on
valiantly
for
some
time
until
nyoda
seeing
that
she
was
going
beyond
her
strength
reached
out
and
pulled
her
into
the
boat
gladys
crouched
in
a
disconsolate
heap
in
the
bottom
of
the
sponson
and
refused
to
be
comforted
by
the
assurance
that
she
had
done
wonderfully
well
all
things
considered
and
that
a
number
of
the
other
girls
had
failed
their
first
test
i
do
it
she
said
clenching
her
hands
or
die
and
she
did
the
old
weakness
overcame
her
at
the
same
distance
out
but
this
time
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
turn
over
on
her
back
and
rest
and
went
on
again
when
she
had
her
breath
back
nyoda
noted
this
manoeuver
approvingly
it
indicated
good
sense
gladys
covered
the
last
yards
by
sheer
grit
every
breath
was
a
gasp
the
shore
line
wavered
dizzily
before
her
and
it
seemed
that
she
was
pushing
against
an
immovable
wall
nyoda
watched
her
closely
and
saw
her
rear
up
her
head
and
set
her
teeth
and
battle
on
against
wind
and
wave
do
she
said
to
herself
joyfully
she
has
physical
courage
as
well
as
the
others
she
will
uphold
the
honor
of
the
winnebagos
that
will
do
she
said
gently
as
the
boat
grounded
noiselessly
on
the
sloping
beach
gladys
feet
struck
solid
ground
and
she
opened
her
eyes
in
surprise
is
it
all
over
she
asked
wonderingly
all
over
said
nyoda
congratulations
she
was
borne
back
to
the
dock
in
triumph
to
be
praised
and
patted
on
the
head
by
all
the
girls
like
a
conquering
hero
sahwah
was
particularly
pleased
at
her
success
when
you
first
came
i
did
think
you
had
it
in
you
she
said
but
now
i
believe
you
can
do
anything
you
want
to
when
may
i
go
out
in
a
canoe
asked
gladys
right
this
very
minute
said
nyoda
and
took
her
out
for
a
ride
in
the
sailing
canoe
the
morning
song
hour
had
now
become
a
time
of
keenest
pleasure
for
gladys
threw
herself
into
the
work
with
heart
and
voice
her
strong
sure
soprano
led
the
girls
through
many
a
difficult
passage
which
they
could
not
have
attempted
without
her
help
and
she
taught
them
much
about
expression
she
took
great
pleasure
in
singing
solo
parts
and
having
the
girls
hum
the
accompaniment
this
last
arrangement
was
particularly
effective
on
the
water
and
the
hills
echoed
nightly
with
don
you
cry
ma
honey
mammy
lou
rockin
in
the
wind
and
other
negro
melodies
besides
boating
songs
galore
migwan
won
a
local
song
honor
by
writing
a
lullaby
beginning
over
the
water
night
steers
her
canoe
she
coming
she
coming
for
me
and
for
you
but
the
favorite
canoe
song
was
and
always
would
be
across
the
silver
lake
and
the
girls
sang
it
first
and
last
every
night
the
moon
was
in
full
glory
at
that
time
of
the
month
and
the
glittering
lake
closed
in
by
high
dark
pines
made
a
scene
of
indescribable
beauty
it
was
harder
each
night
to
break
away
and
go
to
bed
o
dear
sighed
migwan
one
night
why
do
we
have
to
go
to
bed
at
all
i
like
to
stay
up
and
serenade
the
moon
all
night
i
do
know
as
i
care
about
wasting
songs
on
that
old
dead
moon
said
practical
sahwah
but
there
is
one
thing
i
like
to
do
and
that
is
serenade
the
doctor
that
a
good
idea
said
nyoda
and
one
which
we
must
carry
out
so
the
next
morning
they
gathered
around
the
piano
to
practise
a
song
to
sing
under
hoffman
window
we
ought
to
sing
a
german
one
said
sahwah
that
would
please
him
more
than
anything
they
picked
out
the
lorelei
and
began
learning
the
german
words
the
night
was
one
of
magic
splendor
and
the
lake
was
without
a
ripple
as
the
two
long
dark
canoes
glided
silently
over
the
water
toward
the
opposite
shore
the
doctor
house
which
was
a
summer
cottage
stood
close
to
the
beach
and
a
light
on
the
side
where
his
office
was
assured
them
that
he
was
at
home
gladys
started
them
off
and
the
beautiful
strains
rose
on
the
still
air
ich
weiss
nicht
wass
soll
es
bedeuten
dass
ich
so
traurig
bin
inside
the
office
the
doctor
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
his
whole
body
bowed
in
grief
and
despair
on
the
table
beside
him
lay
an
open
letter
and
in
his
hand
he
clasped
a
small
iron
cross
heinrich
he
cried
brokenly
my
heinrich
the
letter
told
the
story
when
the
war
broke
out
the
young
man
had
been
called
from
his
studies
in
the
university
to
take
up
arms
for
his
country
and
fell
in
the
very
first
battle
at
the
storming
of
liege
not
before
he
had
distinguished
himself
for
bravery
however
he
received
the
bullet
which
caused
his
death
while
carrying
a
wounded
comrade
off
the
battlefield
in
the
face
of
a
murderous
fire
from
the
enemy
and
wounded
and
suffering
had
borne
his
friend
to
safety
he
lived
just
long
enough
to
be
decorated
with
the
iron
cross
which
he
begged
the
captain
to
send
to
his
father
as
his
last
message
it
was
a
heavy
blow
for
the
old
man
who
was
counting
the
days
until
his
son
should
come
to
america
and
go
into
partnership
with
him
the
world
became
a
dark
and
sad
place
for
him
and
he
had
no
ambition
to
go
on
living
the
only
consolation
he
had
was
the
thought
that
his
son
had
died
a
hero
and
his
last
act
had
brought
honor
to
his
family
he
gripped
the
iron
cross
tightly
and
wished
passionately
that
heinrich
had
lived
to
wear
it
as
the
lonely
old
doctor
sat
there
with
his
head
in
his
hands
trying
to
realize
the
misfortune
which
had
crushed
him
he
heard
strains
of
music
floating
up
from
the
lake
ich
weiss
nicht
wass
soll
es
bedeuten
dass
ich
so
traurig
bin
the
sweet
girlish
voices
rang
out
in
fine
harmony
the
doctor
raised
his
head
to
listen
bless
dere
liddle
hearts
he
murmured
dey
are
bringing
me
a
serenade
to
please
me
a
tiny
ray
of
pleasure
visited
his
sad
heart
tell
dem
he
said
to
his
housekeeper
dat
de
old
doctor
has
too
much
sorrow
to
speak
to
dem
but
he
tanks
dem
for
de
song
and
hopes
dey
will
come
again
chapter
ix
the
white
men
lodges
do
stand
so
stiffly
sahwah
said
gladys
bend
your
knees
a
little
let
yourself
go
in
the
air
the
way
you
were
always
telling
me
to
let
myself
go
in
the
water
see
this
way
she
took
a
few
graceful
dancing
steps
back
and
forth
in
front
of
sahwah
sahwah
did
her
best
to
imitate
her
there
that
a
little
better
said
gladys
but
there
is
lots
of
room
for
improvement
still
now
one
two
three
point
step

sahwah
struggled
to
follow
her
directions
poising
her
free
hand
in
the
air
as
gladys
did
you
handle
your
feet
fairly
well
said
gladys
but
you
ought
to
see
your
face
you
look
as
if
you
were
performing
the
most
disagreeable
task
and
were
in
perfect
misery
over
it
smile
when
you
dance
and
incline
your
head
gracefully
and
do
act
as
if
it
were
glued
immovably
onto
your
shoulders
sahwah
dutifully
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
and
gladys
shook
her
head
again
no
not
like
that
it
makes
you
look
like
a
clown
just
smile
slightly
and
naturally
act
as
if
you
were
enjoying
yourself
thus
the
lesson
proceeded
gladys
had
undertaken
the
task
of
teaching
sahwah
fancy
dancing
and
drilled
her
every
morning
in
the
shack
sahwah
was
eager
to
learn
and
practised
the
steps
until
her
feet
ached
with
weariness
there
said
gladys
as
sahwah
succeeded
in
memorizing
a
number
of
steps
now
we
try
it
with
the
music
remember
you
are
impersonating
a
tree
swaying
in
the
wind
and
bend
from
your
waist
line
that
the
right
way
now
everybody
up
for
the
she
called
when
sahwah
flushed
and
panting
sat
down
in
a
corner
to
rest
the
girls
lined
up
briskly
for
their
lesson
nearly
all
of
them
knew
the
correct
steps
of
the
modern
society
dances
but
few
of
them
danced
really
well
and
it
was
the
little
fine
touches
and
graces
that
gladys
was
teaching
them
lightness
of
foot
stateliness
of
carriage
graceful
disposing
of
arms
and
hands
gladys
had
taken
charge
of
the
entire
dancing
hour
now
and
it
was
the
most
popular
class
in
the
whole
schedule
nyoda
was
a
little
breathless
at
the
way
gladys
was
developing
into
a
leader
she
who
a
few
weeks
before
was
not
able
to
reach
the
standards
which
the
winnebagos
had
set
for
themselves
was
now
calmly
leading
them
on
to
greater
heights
now
that
gladys
had
learned
to
swim
the
next
thing
for
her
to
do
was
to
get
used
to
jumping
into
deep
water
she
stood
out
on
the
end
of
the
low
springboard
a
long
time
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
to
go
off
and
finally
shrank
back
thoroughly
disgusted
with
herself
but
unable
to
bring
herself
to
make
the
leap
shall
i
hold
your
hand
the
first
time
said
nyoda
holding
tightly
to
nyoda
hand
gladys
jumped
from
the
board
and
sank
down
down
through
the
glassy
translucent
depths
holding
her
breath
and
trying
to
keep
her
eyes
open
as
she
had
been
bidden
at
first
all
was
darkness
then
a
mass
of
bubbles
became
visible
then
light
shone
through
the
water
and
the
next
moment
her
head
shot
out
above
the
surface
and
nyoda
pulled
her
up
on
the
dock
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
that
she
had
no
time
to
be
frightened
why
it
she
said
in
amazement
all
the
girls
laughed
at
the
comical
expression
on
her
face
now
do
it
alone
said
nyoda
and
this
time
try
to
right
yourself
and
begin
to
swim
again
gladys
jumped
into
the
depths
and
as
soon
as
her
head
was
clear
of
the
water
struck
out
of
her
own
accord
and
swam
around
the
dock
now
come
up
and
turn
over
on
your
back
and
float
said
nyoda
gladys
accomplished
this
also
she
could
not
overcome
her
astonishment
at
the
feats
she
was
able
to
perform
in
the
water
now
that
she
had
lost
her
fear
of
it
she
became
bolder
and
bolder
with
each
new
trial
and
finally
took
every
one
breath
away
by
announcing
that
she
was
going
off
the
top
of
the
tower
and
she
did
it
too
without
a
moment
hesitation
there
was
one
trick
she
had
which
caused
them
all
great
amusement
she
hold
her
nose
when
she
jumped
which
nyoda
laughingly
explained
was
bad
form
indeed
it
was
a
sight
to
see
her
going
off
the
tower
feet
together
like
a
statue
one
hand
held
straight
above
her
head
and
the
other
tight
over
her
nose
sahwah
arm
had
fully
healed
by
this
time
and
the
splints
were
taken
off
the
old
doctor
tried
hard
to
be
cheerful
when
she
came
to
him
the
last
time
but
his
heart
had
gone
out
of
his
work
he
told
sahwah
about
his
son
and
showed
her
the
iron
cross
led
on
by
her
sympathetic
manner
he
talked
a
long
time
about
heinrich
told
her
little
incidents
of
his
school
days
and
dwelt
with
pride
on
the
record
he
had
made
in
the
class
room
in
the
gymnasium
in
the
klinik
when
he
spoke
of
the
brave
deed
which
had
won
him
the
iron
cross
his
voice
sank
into
a
reverent
whisper
and
his
stooped
figure
straightened
up
into
the
bearing
of
a
soldier
it
was
no
light
thing
to
be
the
father
of
a
hero
then
he
added
but
i
forget
missis
sahwah
you
haf
also
done
a
brave
deed
and
brought
honor
to
your
family
you
should
also
haf
de
iron
cross
sahwah
smiled
at
the
idea
of
being
decorated
for
pushing
a
lady
by
de
neck
across
de
top
of
de
lake
as
the
doctor
had
expressed
it
she
and
the
doctor
had
become
great
friends
while
he
was
taking
care
of
her
arm
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
from
the
start
sahwah
had
no
german
blood
in
her
she
was
straight
puritan
descent
and
knew
only
the
few
words
of
the
german
language
she
had
acquired
in
school
and
pronounced
them
badly
she
reminded
him
of
nothing
in
the
fatherland
and
he
was
unlike
any
one
she
had
ever
associated
with
and
yet
between
these
two
there
had
sprung
up
the
warmest
kind
of
friendship
he
opened
up
his
cabinet
and
let
her
handle
the
instruments
a
thing
it
would
have
been
worth
his
housekeeper
life
to
have
tried
he
pulled
out
old
pipes
and
pieces
of
pewter
and
told
her
their
stories
he
showed
her
pictures
of
his
wife
and
little
heinrich
and
sahwah
in
turn
took
his
breath
away
recounting
the
escapades
of
the
winnebagos
she
made
him
promise
to
come
over
to
camp
to
see
her
new
canoe
launched
promptly
at
the
time
appointed
he
came
in
his
own
launch
with
a
big
straw
hat
shading
his
face
and
his
surgical
case
in
his
hand
in
case
von
of
de
ladies
should
break
her
a
bone
sahwah
had
named
her
new
canoe
the
or
and
the
launching
proceeded
ceremoniously
the
seven
girls
carried
it
down
to
the
water
edge
its
sides
decorated
with
balsam
boughs
saluted
it
by
raising
it
three
times
above
their
heads
at
arm
length
and
then
held
it
while
migwan
recited
a
poem
in
honor
of
the
launching
out
the
shining
lake
glide
thou
my
bark
canoe
out
toward
the
purple
hills
lovely
swift
as
the
seabird
wing
light
as
the
ocean
foam
speed
the
dancing
wave
lovely
the
canoe
was
lowered
to
the
water
edge
and
sahwah
and
gladys
got
in
and
paddled
out
from
shore
followed
by
the
cheers
of
the
girls
when
the
had
returned
from
her
maiden
voyage
hinpoha
and
migwan
were
ready
with
a
stunt
to
amuse
the
audience
they
dramatized
that
classic
argument
between
the
man
and
his
wife
as
to
whether
the
crime
was
committed
with
a
knife
or
a
scissors
migwan
as
the
husband
stoutly
maintained
that
it
was
a
knife
and
hinpoha
as
his
spouse
fiercely
declared
it
was
a
scissors
arguing
hotly
they
went
out
in
a
canoe
and
soon
came
to
blows
about
the
point
in
question
the
man
threw
his
wife
overboard
and
hit
her
with
a
paddle
every
time
she
poked
her
head
up
she
kept
coming
up
and
saying
scissors
while
he
insisted
knife
as
the
story
goes
the
wife
finally
drowns
and
the
last
minute
her
fingers
come
up
making
a
scissors
motion
migwan
however
after
hinpoha
went
overboard
hit
out
so
energetically
with
her
paddle
that
the
canoe
went
over
and
the
climax
was
lost
in
the
splash
the
girls
did
everything
they
could
think
of
to
cheer
up
the
doctor
and
made
a
great
feast
in
his
honor
sahwah
baked
her
feathery
biscuits
migwan
stirred
up
a
pan
of
delicious
fudge
hinpoha
made
her
famous
slumgullion
nyoda
broiled
fish
while
the
rest
of
the
girls
gathered
blueberries
in
the
woods
the
cooking
must
have
tasted
good
to
the
doctor
for
he
passed
his
plate
three
times
for
slumgullion
and
ate
so
many
biscuits
he
lost
count
hinpoha
too
throwing
her
vow
of
abstinence
to
the
winds
ate
until
she
groaned
and
while
she
was
clearing
away
the
dishes
finished
up
all
that
was
left
of
the
fudge
and
the
blueberries
the
doctor
took
his
leave
in
the
afternoon
declaring
he
had
never
eaten
anything
so
good
as
biscuits
she
can
make
he
said
impressively
better
biscuits
dan
my
grandmama
and
she
made
de
best
biscuits
in
hamburg
strange
to
say
the
girls
were
not
very
hungry
at
supper
time
and
ate
nothing
but
wafers
and
lemonade
where
are
you
going
with
your
blankets
said
nyoda
stopping
in
surprise
as
she
met
migwan
coming
out
of
her
tent
with
all
her
bedding
in
her
arms
i
going
to
sleep
in
the
answered
migwan
sleep
in
the
echoed
nyoda
is
there
room
enough
in
the
tent
oh
there
room
enough
said
migwan
that
is
the
reason
i
just
want
to
do
it
for
the
experience
i
was
lying
awake
the
other
night
listening
to
the
wind
singing
through
the
treetops
and
i
thought
of
all
the
little
birds
sleeping
up
in
the
trees
and
decided
i
would
try
it
and
see
what
it
was
like
her
poet
soul
spurns
the
common
earth
and
she
seeks
the
treetops
to
be
nearer
the
sky
said
nyoda
banteringly
if
i
may
intrude
such
a
material
question
among
your
ethereal
desires
she
continued
how
are
you
going
to
get
your
blankets
up
there
migwan
stopped
a
little
taken
aback
the
was
more
than
thirty
feet
from
the
ground
and
in
order
to
get
into
it
the
girls
had
to
climb
up
the
limbs
of
the
tree
some
of
the
branches
were
far
apart
and
it
was
quite
a
stretch
to
make
the
distance
while
the
long
space
from
the
ground
to
the
first
branch
was
notched
to
assure
a
foothold
it
was
easy
enough
climbing
but
scrambling
up
there
with
an
armful
of
blankets
was
another
matter
nyoda
watched
the
expression
on
migwan
face
with
keen
amusement
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
was
always
doing
her
poetic
fancy
would
be
kindled
to
a
certain
idea
without
ever
stopping
to
consider
the
practical
side
but
migwan
was
resourceful
as
well
as
romantic
she
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
laid
her
blankets
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
repaired
to
the
kitchen
whence
she
presently
emerged
with
a
long
rope
made
of
sundry
short
ropes
tied
together
and
pieced
out
with
strips
of
cloth
winding
this
around
her
waist
she
climbed
the
tree
and
fastened
one
end
of
it
to
the
railing
of
the
crow
nest
then
she
let
the
other
end
down
asked
nyoda
to
tie
her
bedding
to
it
and
hauled
it
up
with
the
greatest
ease
the
floor
struck
her
as
being
far
from
soft
when
she
spread
her
blankets
out
and
by
dint
of
much
labor
she
also
hauled
up
her
mattress
then
she
had
a
further
inspiration
and
laid
the
mattress
across
two
poles
which
kept
it
up
off
the
floor
and
made
it
softer
yet
the
moon
and
stars
seemed
very
close
when
she
finally
had
the
bed
fixed
to
her
satisfaction
and
stood
looking
around
her
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
put
out
her
hand
and
grasp
the
great
bear
by
the
tail
jupiter
was
just
at
her
left
hand
peeking
impudently
through
the
branches
while
she
undressed
down
below
the
tents
gleamed
ghostly
in
the
pale
light
what
an
airy
cradle
it
was
after
she
was
rolled
in
the
blankets
and
fixed
comfortably
for
sight
seeing
the
breezes
fiddled
through
the
twigs
making
elfin
music
and
the
swayed
gently
it
was
too
beautiful
to
sleep
through
and
migwan
lay
awake
hour
after
hour
in
wonder
and
delight
watching
the
moon
steer
her
placid
course
across
the
sky
she
saw
jupiter
culminate
and
incline
to
westward
saw
arcturus
sink
behind
the
hills
and
watched
the
dipper
go
wheeling
round
the
pole
like
the
hand
of
an
enormous
clock
off
somewhere
in
the
woods
a
was
lamenting
the
waves
splashed
against
the
rocks
below
a
cricket
chirped
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
migwan
turned
over
to
get
a
look
at
the
view
on
the
other
side
and
her
pillow
went
overboard
with
a
soft
plop
she
leaned
over
the
edge
to
see
where
it
had
gone
and
the
poles
slid
gently
apart
letting
the
mattress
down
flat
on
the
floor
she
adjusted
herself
to
the
new
position
and
continued
looking
up
when
all
the
stars
had
traveled
to
the
morning
side
of
the
sky
she
finally
dropped
off
to
sleep
only
to
waken
again
with
the
first
faint
gray
light
of
dawn
a
frowzy
bird
flew
into
the
tree
just
above
her
head
and
balanced
himself
on
the
limb
he
had
evidently
been
out
all
night
and
was
sneaking
home
in
the
wee
sma
hours
much
the
worse
for
dissipation
he
teetered
back
and
forth
for
a
moment
then
began
unsteadily
climbing
the
stairs
up
the
branches
migwan
hoped
his
wife
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
top
step
and
listened
to
hear
the
curtain
lecture
he
would
receive
she
heard
no
uproar
however
and
concluded
he
was
a
bachelor
and
could
go
and
come
when
he
pleased
in
contrast
to
migwan
peaceful
night
hinpoha
lay
tossing
in
dire
distress
she
was
no
sooner
in
bed
than
the
biscuits
she
had
gobbled
for
dinner
started
to
make
war
on
the
slumgullion
and
the
lemonade
began
to
have
words
with
the
blueberries
the
fudge
was
a
power
unto
itself
and
made
war
on
all
the
rest
hinpoha
tried
to
get
up
and
get
something
to
relieve
herself
but
she
was
so
dizzy
she
could
stand
a
great
monstrous
biscuit
was
sitting
on
the
pit
of
her
stomach
squeezing
the
breath
out
of
her
and
she
sank
back
on
the
pillow
sahwah
finally
heard
her
groan
and
got
up
and
brought
her
some
hot
water
which
settled
the
dispute
going
on
in
her
stomach
gladys
and
sahwah
were
coming
home
from
the
village
in
the
launch
one
afternoon
where
they
had
been
to
get
the
milk
it
looked
like
rain
and
they
were
hastening
to
get
back
to
camp
great
was
their
vexation
therefore
when
the
engine
wheezed
a
few
times
and
then
stopped
dead
still
investigation
revealed
that
the
gasoline
had
given
out
why
did
i
think
to
fill
her
up
before
we
left
said
sahwah
impatiently
here
we
are
out
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
with
never
an
oar
or
a
paddle
and
not
a
bit
of
breeze
blowing
why
we
are
even
drifting
to
all
appearances
it
looked
as
if
they
were
becalmed
there
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
until
they
would
be
missed
from
camp
and
gladys
said
so
resignedly
i
should
say
i
wo
stay
here
all
afternoon
said
sahwah
i
swim
ashore
first
the
girls
are
waiting
for
this
milk
i
wonder
if
anybody
would
see
us
if
we
ran
up
a
distress
signal
what
could
we
use
for
one
asked
gladys
sahwah
looked
around
for
a
moment
and
then
calmly
took
off
her
middy
and
waved
it
around
her
head
by
one
sleeve
they
were
hidden
from
camp
by
a
bend
in
the
shore
line
but
they
hoped
to
attract
the
attention
of
some
of
the
other
campers
along
the
lake
besides
waving
the
middy
both
girls
called
and
yodled
until
they
were
hoarse
at
last
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
a
launch
coming
across
the
lake
toward
them
with
a
flag
waving
in
answer
to
their
signal
sahwah
hastily
put
on
her
middy
again
there
were
two
boys
of
about
sixteen
in
the
launch
and
they
stopped
alongside
of
the
and
inquired
the
trouble
we
have
run
out
of
gasoline
said
sahwah
would
you
like
us
to
tow
you
in
so
you
can
get
a
asked
the
boy
who
was
running
the
launch
we
from
the
mountain
lake
camp
over
yonder
and
have
plenty
of
gasoline
to
spare
the
girls
agreed
and
the
boys
threw
them
a
tow
line
and
off
they
went
toward
the
shore
upon
landing
they
found
themselves
in
a
large
summer
camp
for
boys
boys
of
every
age
and
size
from
six
years
up
to
eighteen
were
swarming
around
the
dock
waiting
to
see
who
the
distressed
sailors
were
and
the
girls
became
the
center
of
interest
the
two
boys
who
had
brought
them
in
and
who
had
introduced
themselves
as
the
roberts
brothers
ed
and
ned
called
one
of
the
senior
counsellors
and
told
him
the
trouble
and
he
willingly
agreed
to
sell
sahwah
and
gladys
a
quantity
of
gasoline
great
interest
was
aroused
when
the
girls
said
they
were
from
camp
winnebago
for
the
fame
of
some
of
their
doings
had
gone
about
the
village
and
their
singing
on
the
lake
at
night
had
been
heard
by
more
people
than
they
knew
did
one
of
your
girls
tow
in
another
one
with
both
her
arms
broken
asked
one
of
the
boys
standing
near
sahwah
and
gladys
laughed
outright
at
this
version
of
the
story
when
gladys
announced
that
sahwah
was
the
heroine
in
question
and
she
the
nearly
drowned
maiden
a
ripple
went
went
through
the
camp
i
do
see
how
you
ever
did
it
said
another
of
the
boys
you
so
little
sahwah
was
sorely
tempted
to
do
one
of
her
famous
dives
right
then
and
there
only
she
knew
that
such
an
exhibition
would
be
entirely
out
of
place
and
so
restrained
herself
it
began
to
rain
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
gasoline
and
the
counsellor
insisted
upon
their
remaining
until
it
stopped
and
took
them
up
into
one
of
the
bungalows
in
which
the
boys
lived
before
they
left
he
showed
them
all
over
the
camp
the
boys
lived
in
little
wooden
lodges
called
senior
and
junior
lodges
the
younger
ones
on
one
side
of
the
camp
and
the
older
ones
on
the
other
they
were
divided
into
three
classes
according
to
their
swimming
ability
namely
minnows
perch
and
salmon
and
the
different
groups
had
different
swimming
hours
do
you
have
different
grades
in
swimming
too
asked
ned
roberts
no
replied
sahwah
we
all
salmon
ned
looked
at
gladys
expressively
and
sahwah
read
his
meaning
oh
she
swims
beautifully
now
she
said
loyally
at
any
rate
i
would
have
to
be
rescued
any
more
even
if
i
do
classify
as
a
salmon
said
gladys
sahwah
could
not
help
noticing
how
much
gladys
was
at
her
ease
among
these
boys
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
lips
smiled
and
she
displayed
a
lively
interest
in
all
that
they
showed
her
one
of
the
roberts
boys
ed
was
quite
taken
with
her
and
determined
to
see
more
of
her
before
the
summer
was
over
when
they
took
their
departure
these
two
boys
asked
permission
to
call
on
her
and
sahwah
would
you
like
to
bring
some
more
of
the
boys
and
come
and
see
all
of
us
said
gladys
i
bring
the
boys
over
sometime
promised
the
counsellor
the
very
next
morning
a
boy
wearing
the
uniform
of
the
mountain
lake
camp
came
in
a
launch
and
presented
a
note
to
nyoda
it
read
mountain
lake
camp
sends
greetings
to
camp
winnebago
and
begs
permission
to
send
a
delegation
to
call
and
pay
its
respects
nyoda
wrote
in
answer
camp
winnebago
heartily
returns
mountain
lake
camp
greetings
and
begs
to
say
that
it
will
be
at
home
this
very
sundown
what
a
flutter
of
excitement
there
was
after
the
envoy
had
gone
gladys
and
sahwah
were
overwhelmed
with
questions
about
the
boys
and
conjectures
as
to
how
many
and
which
ones
were
coming
tents
were
cleaned
and
put
in
such
order
as
they
had
never
known
before
the
shack
was
decorated
with
grasses
and
wild
flowers
canoe
cushions
were
brushed
songs
were
practised
and
lemons
squeezed
that
everything
might
be
in
readiness
for
the
visitors
skirts
which
had
not
been
worn
since
the
beginning
of
summer
were
brought
out
of
trunks
and
the
wrinkles
pressed
out
then
there
rose
such
a
chorus
of
exclamations
that
the
birds
stopped
their
own
chattering
to
listen
oh
i
ca
get
my
skirt
shut
why
i
ca
either
not
by
two
inches
oh
fudge
there
goes
the
button
from
every
side
came
the
same
wail
not
a
girl
there
who
had
not
gained
from
five
to
fifteen
pounds
and
the
tight
skirts
made
to
fit
in
their
slenderer
days
were
a
sorry
sight
what
we
do
nyoda
they
groaned
to
their
guardian
who
was
in
the
same
plight
herself
the
only
thing
we
can
do
said
nyoda
inasmuch
as
we
time
to
make
them
over
is
for
all
of
us
to
wear
our
white
linen
skirts
with
our
middies
outside
so
it
wo
show
how
much
they
gap
and
let
this
be
a
solemn
warning
to
every
girl
to
look
over
her
clothes
before
it
is
time
to
go
home
promptly
at
sundown
four
canoes
appeared
around
the
cliff
each
manned
by
two
paddlers
and
drew
up
alongside
the
winnebago
dock
where
the
girls
stood
to
welcome
them
the
counsellor
who
had
shown
sahwah
and
gladys
around
the
boys
camp
was
there
and
the
roberts
brothers
and
five
more
of
the
senior
campers
ed
roberts
looked
around
for
gladys
the
first
thing
and
his
brother
for
sahwah
while
the
rest
paired
off
with
the
other
girls
as
they
went
up
the
hill
to
the
shack
nyoda
was
not
very
fond
of
having
her
company
sitting
around
in
pairs
and
immediately
started
them
to
playing
games
which
took
them
all
in
and
followed
the
games
up
with
a
virginia
reel
ed
roberts
was
filled
with
impatience
at
this
method
of
entertainment
for
it
gave
him
no
chance
to
monopolize
gladys
as
he
would
have
liked
to
he
saw
that
she
was
a
good
dancer
and
was
eager
to
try
a
new
hesitation
step
with
her
by
and
by
gladys
slipped
from
the
room
and
returned
dressed
in
a
fancy
dancing
costume
poising
on
her
toes
as
lightly
as
a
butterfly
she
did
some
of
her
choicest
dances
the
dance
of
the
snowflake
the
daffodil
the
fairy
in
the
fountain
the
admiration
of
the
boys
knew
no
bounds
and
she
received
a
perfect
ovation
now
sahwah
do
your
dance
commanded
nyoda
sahwah
shrank
back
and
did
not
want
to
saying
that
after
gladys
performance
anything
she
could
do
would
seem
pitifully
flat
but
the
boys
all
urged
her
to
try
it
and
at
last
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
out
on
the
floor
by
gladys
she
was
still
in
an
agony
of
embarrassment
and
wished
the
floor
would
open
and
swallow
her
but
it
was
a
rule
of
the
winnebagos
that
if
they
were
called
on
to
perform
for
the
entertainment
of
visitors
they
must
do
the
thing
called
for
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
sahwah
knew
that
if
she
refused
to
dance
the
reckoning
with
nyoda
would
be
worse
than
the
embarrassment
of
dancing
so
she
swallowed
hard
and
went
to
work
she
got
through
it
very
creditably
indeed
and
was
rewarded
with
hearty
applause
which
made
her
more
fussed
than
ever
then
boys
and
girls
alike
clamored
to
be
allowed
to
just
dance
and
ed
roberts
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
try
his
new
hesitation
with
gladys
but
after
she
had
danced
three
or
four
times
with
him
in
succession
she
left
him
for
another
partner
this
made
him
cross
and
he
would
not
ask
any
one
else
to
dance
until
a
quiet
word
from
his
counsellor
sent
him
rather
unwillingly
on
to
the
floor
again
may
i
have
this
one
he
pleaded
every
time
after
that
but
gladys
smilingly
declined
saying
she
had
promised
every
one
of
the
boys
a
dance
and
would
not
get
around
if
she
gave
him
any
more
to
which
he
assented
politely
fuming
inwardly
and
wanted
gladys
to
himself
more
than
ever
bet
i
do
get
another
dance
with
her
he
thought
crossly
and
this
was
exactly
the
case
for
nyoda
presently
suggested
lemonade
and
the
dancing
stopped
it
was
nearly
nine
by
this
time
but
the
boys
pleaded
so
hard
for
a
ride
on
the
lake
in
the
canoes
that
nyoda
yielded
and
granted
fifteen
minutes
extra
ed
roberts
took
immediate
possession
of
gladys
and
led
her
into
his
canoe
before
she
had
time
to
say
a
word
he
pushed
off
before
there
was
time
to
put
any
one
else
in
with
them
for
some
of
the
canoes
had
to
carry
four
as
they
paddled
through
the
moonlit
water
the
girls
sang
across
the
silver
lake
and
by
and
by
the
boys
added
a
few
bass
and
tenor
notes
to
it
fairly
in
tune
now
they
sang
song
after
song
in
time
to
the
dipping
of
their
paddles
how
much
better
any
song
sounds
with
a
bass
to
it
said
nyoda
to
the
counsellor
in
the
canoe
with
her
which
remark
though
merely
an
effort
to
start
a
conversation
on
nyoda
part
caused
the
counsellor
to
flush
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
get
completely
out
of
stroke
sahwah
up
at
the
head
of
the
procession
with
ned
roberts
was
in
her
element
he
was
a
fine
paddler
and
his
stroke
matched
hers
exactly
they
were
in
her
own
little
canoe
the
and
as
it
was
so
much
lighter
than
the
others
they
were
continually
getting
ahead
she
taught
him
the
silent
paddle
of
the
indians
which
they
used
to
hide
their
approach
twisting
the
paddle
around
under
the
surface
to
avoid
the
sound
of
dipping
she
told
him
about
the
rifle
which
gladys
father
had
sent
her
and
he
promised
to
teach
her
to
shoot
it
when
the
boys
made
the
visit
which
nyoda
had
suggested
ed
roberts
managed
to
keep
himself
and
gladys
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
he
was
continually
stopping
to
let
the
canoe
drift
and
gradually
widening
the
distance
between
them
and
the
others
when
they
rounded
one
of
the
little
islands
he
stopped
so
long
that
the
first
canoes
got
out
of
sight
around
the
bend
leaving
them
hidden
behind
the
island
gladys
would
have
paddled
on
but
he
begged
her
to
stop
and
talk
awhile
let
land
on
the
island
and
sit
on
the
rocks
in
the
moonlight
he
proposed
gladys
refused
nyoda
would
like
it
she
said
and
it
past
our
bed
time
already
the
other
canoes
have
started
for
home
o
bother
bed
time
said
ed
petulantly
who
could
bear
to
go
to
bed
on
a
night
like
this
besides
you
can
tell
miss
kent
that
i
broke
my
paddle
and
we
had
trouble
getting
home
gladys
shook
her
head
indignantly
i
do
no
such
thing
she
said
you
take
me
home
immediately
ed
roberts
or
i
send
out
a
call
for
nyoda
sulkily
he
picked
up
his
paddle
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
gladys
paddled
so
energetically
that
they
soon
came
up
with
the
others
and
landed
at
the
dock
with
them
and
as
the
rest
had
been
so
occupied
with
their
own
affairs
the
disappearance
of
the
one
canoe
for
several
minutes
had
gone
unnoticed
the
boys
shook
hands
all
around
and
departed
in
their
canoes
singing
until
they
disappeared
around
the
cliff
chapter
blueberry
island
gladys
sat
poring
over
the
list
of
honors
in
the
handbook
looking
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
she
had
been
a
wood
gatherer
for
several
weeks
and
was
hoping
to
be
made
a
fire
maker
before
the
end
of
the
summer
with
considerable
pride
she
painted
in
the
pictographs
on
her
record
sheet
which
stood
for
the
honors
already
won
swim
one
hundred
yards
was
it
really
true
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
this
honor
had
seemed
as
unattainable
as
flying
the
same
distance
in
the
air
she
was
also
learning
to
recognize
the
different
birds
trees
and
flowers
that
she
found
in
the
woods
and
along
the
roads
she
was
a
very
much
surprised
girl
indeed
when
nyoda
pointed
out
at
least
a
half
dozen
different
varieties
of
ferns
and
grasses
on
one
afternoon
walk
are
there
different
kinds
of
ferns
and
grasses
she
asked
in
astonishment
i
thought
grass
was
just
grass
and
ferns
were
just
ferns
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
winning
honors
had
become
a
fascinating
game
and
she
read
carefully
through
the
list
putting
a
mark
opposite
those
she
thought
she
could
accomplish
before
the
next
council
fire
sahwah
sitting
near
her
similarly
occupied
suddenly
called
to
nyoda
how
about
all
of
us
winning
this
honor
for
planning
an
outing
to
include
as
many
boys
as
girls
she
asked
we
have
never
had
our
trip
to
blueberry
island
and
it
would
be
fun
to
have
the
boys
along
for
a
whole
day
all
the
girls
immediately
shouted
their
approval
and
nyoda
said
it
would
be
a
fine
idea
we
have
to
go
in
a
couple
of
days
though
for
the
blueberries
will
not
last
much
longer
she
said
we
ask
them
this
very
day
nyoda
delivered
the
invitation
in
person
sherry
the
counsellor
who
had
escorted
the
boys
the
other
night
was
mending
the
dock
when
she
approached
in
the
and
was
very
much
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
her
he
received
the
idea
of
a
joint
excursion
with
enthusiasm
but
said
he
would
have
to
wait
until
the
camp
director
returned
from
a
day
trip
with
three
of
the
older
boys
before
he
could
accept
definitely
he
would
let
her
know
in
the
evening
now
sherry
knew
well
enough
that
there
was
no
question
about
accepting
the
invitation
but
he
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
a
visit
to
camp
winnebago
that
night
would
benefit
his
health
considerably
and
so
delayed
his
answer
nyoda
returned
to
camp
and
reported
the
result
of
her
mission
and
the
girls
settled
down
to
wait
for
definite
news
ned
roberts
told
me
he
wished
they
could
come
over
every
night
said
sahwah
poising
her
woodblock
in
the
air
preparatory
to
stamping
it
down
on
the
table
cover
she
was
decorating
gracious
said
migwan
what
a
bore
that
would
be
we
never
get
anything
done
for
ourselves
because
we
spend
all
day
getting
ready
for
them
migwan
begrudged
every
minute
that
she
lost
from
the
book
she
was
making
for
professor
bentley
it
impossible
anyway
said
gladys
in
a
tone
of
finality
because
we
have
enough
skirts
to
last
i
have
to
let
out
the
belt
of
mine
before
i
can
wear
it
again
it
was
so
tight
last
night
i
nearly
died
that
reminds
me
she
went
on
has
anybody
seen
that
yellow
scarf
i
had
last
night
when
i
was
dancing
the
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
find
it
this
morning
nobody
had
seen
the
scarf
but
all
promised
to
look
through
their
belongings
to
see
if
it
had
accidentally
been
put
in
among
them
i
thought
i
left
it
hanging
on
the
railing
of
the
shack
said
gladys
i
might
as
well
fix
my
skirt
right
away
said
sahwah
when
conjectures
about
the
whereabouts
of
the
scarf
had
ceased
never
have
any
more
time
than
now
she
rose
and
went
to
her
tent
but
returned
in
a
few
moments
looking
mystified
i
find
my
white
skirt
she
announced
i
hung
it
on
the
tent
ropes
last
night
because
it
got
splashed
with
water
in
the
canoe
has
somebody
taken
it
for
a
joke
hinpoha
she
cried
pointing
her
finger
at
her
you
did
it
hinpoha
shook
her
head
in
all
seriousness
not
guilty
this
time
she
said
the
funny
part
of
it
is
that
i
saw
that
skirt
hanging
in
the
moonlight
after
i
was
in
bed
and
thought
what
a
good
joke
it
would
be
to
throw
it
up
on
top
of
the
tent
but
i
was
too
sleepy
to
get
up
and
do
it
sahwah
still
suspected
hinpoha
and
hinpoha
went
on
declaring
her
innocence
when
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
from
the
mountain
lake
camp
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
he
bringing
the
answer
to
our
invitation
cried
the
girls
as
the
young
lad
came
up
the
path
from
the
dock
but
instead
of
approaching
nyoda
with
his
message
as
they
expected
he
asked
for
miss
gladys
and
handed
her
the
envelope
gladys
opened
the
note
and
read
dear
miss
gladys
the
lateness
of
the
hour
kept
us
from
having
a
pleasant
talk
on
the
island
the
other
night
but
i
hope
we
may
have
an
opportunity
some
other
time
if
i
come
for
you
will
you
go
out
canoeing
with
me
just
you
alone
and
please
get
permission
to
stay
out
as
long
as
you
like
as
the
counsellor
in
our
lodge
will
be
away
and
if
i
not
in
when
blows
nobody
will
know
the
difference
in
hopes
ed
roberts
gladys
flushed
painfully
and
all
the
girls
crowding
around
teased
her
and
asked
if
it
was
a
love
letter
she
wrote
an
answer
and
gave
it
to
the
boy
dear
roberts
is
our
council
fire
and
naturally
i
would
not
care
to
leave
camp
i
do
not
think
i
care
to
go
any
other
night
either
as
a
winnebago
could
never
take
advantage
of
a
counsellor
absence
to
stay
out
after
hours
i
am
surprised
and
disappointed
in
you
the
boy
departed
and
she
threw
ed
note
into
the
fire
simply
telling
the
girls
that
he
had
asked
her
to
go
out
canoeing
that
night
and
that
she
had
refused
she
said
nothing
about
the
underhand
business
he
had
proposed
or
the
episode
of
the
other
night
the
camp
fire
leaven
had
done
its
work
thoroughly
and
gladys
had
fulfilled
that
part
of
the
law
which
reads
be
trustworthy
sherry
the
senior
counsellor
left
the
mountain
lake
camp
in
the
gathering
dusk
heading
his
canoe
in
the
opposite
direction
from
camp
winnebago
far
out
in
the
lake
he
turned
right
about
face
and
pulled
rapidly
toward
the
winnebago
dock
a
steady
rain
was
falling
and
he
drew
the
canoe
up
on
the
sand
and
turned
it
upside
down
carefully
before
mounting
the
path
he
thought
of
course
the
girls
would
be
in
the
shack
and
bent
his
steps
thither
but
it
was
deserted
neither
was
there
a
sign
of
any
one
in
the
tents
he
looked
into
the
mess
tent
and
into
the
kitchen
end
of
the
shack
but
found
no
one
must
be
off
for
a
ride
he
reflected
no
that
ca
be
either
because
all
the
boats
are
in
they
must
have
walked
to
the
village
and
with
disappointment
showing
in
every
line
of
his
face
he
turned
his
steps
back
toward
his
boat
just
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
singing
coming
from
somewhere
burn
fire
burn
burn
fire
burn
flicker
flicker
flicker
flicker
flame
with
ears
strained
to
listen
he
began
to
walk
toward
the
sound
soon
he
saw
the
soft
glow
of
a
fire
shining
through
the
distant
trees
and
hastened
toward
it
the
torch
shall
draw
them
to
the
fire
the
wind
carried
the
words
distinctly
to
his
ears
through
the
wet
loneliness
of
the
woods
the
flame
drew
him
like
a
magnet
drawing
nearer
he
saw
a
bright
fire
burning
high
in
the
middle
of
an
open
space
unchecked
by
the
rain
and
around
it
moved
a
number
of
figures
he
recognized
the
winnebagos
clad
in
bathing
suits
and
bathing
caps
and
covered
with
their
ponchos
calmly
having
their
ceremonial
meeting
in
the
pouring
rain
the
song
over
they
sat
down
in
a
circle
and
went
through
their
ritual
with
the
water
streaming
over
their
firelit
faces
a
play
was
enacted
which
he
made
out
to
be
a
pantomime
presentation
of
cinderella
and
he
recognized
nyoda
in
the
guise
of
the
fairy
godmother
hinpoha
was
the
prince
and
migwan
cinderella
in
the
teeming
rain
she
was
rescued
from
her
ashy
seat
by
the
fireplace
and
borne
to
the
ball
as
the
prince
bent
over
to
fit
the
slipper
to
her
foot
a
perfect
torrent
rolled
off
his
poncho
into
her
lap
and
threatened
to
swamp
the
romance
they
plighted
their
troth
with
one
hand
and
held
their
ponchos
around
them
with
the
other
sherry
pulled
his
down
over
his
ears
and
standing
under
the
shelter
of
a
pine
tree
watched
the
performance
to
the
end
glory
what
a
bunch
of
girls
he
muttered
to
himself
having
fun
out
in
the
wet
woods
while
our
boys
are
sticking
around
in
their
dry
bungalows
the
council
fire
came
to
an
end
and
the
girls
filed
out
among
the
trees
singing
the
goodnight
song
of
course
sherry
did
know
the
difference
but
instead
of
singing
the
regular
words
may
the
peace
of
our
firelit
faces
most
of
the
girls
were
singing
may
the
peace
of
our
dripping
noses
nyoda
was
the
last
to
come
as
she
had
lingered
to
extinguish
the
fire
and
sherry
placed
himself
directly
in
her
path
and
stepped
out
from
behind
a
tree
as
she
came
along
she
started
violently
and
flashed
her
bug
light
in
his
face
be
afraid
he
said
embarrassed
and
blushing
it
only
i
come
to
tell
you
that
the
boys
can
accept
your
invitation
to
go
to
blueberry
island
next
wednesday
oh
said
nyoda
lowering
her
bug
light
and
laughing
very
good
news
indeed
the
girls
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
i
must
tell
them
right
away
sherry
thought
to
himself
that
the
news
might
keep
awhile
as
he
had
several
other
topics
of
conversation
which
would
have
beguiled
the
way
up
to
the
tents
but
nyoda
called
out
to
the
girls
and
they
came
running
back
and
swarmed
all
over
her
and
there
was
no
chance
for
the
poor
man
to
say
a
word
after
standing
around
for
a
few
minutes
he
took
his
leave
and
paddled
back
to
mountain
lake
camp
looking
rather
drenched
and
forlorn
the
girls
spent
the
next
day
in
preparation
for
the
picnic
full
of
joyous
anticipation
but
gladys
was
filled
with
secret
trepidation
she
knew
ed
roberts
would
be
there
and
would
try
to
force
himself
upon
her
and
she
was
afraid
her
pleasure
would
be
spoiled
she
said
nothing
about
it
however
for
she
feared
nyoda
would
take
some
decisive
action
which
might
result
in
none
of
the
boys
being
allowed
to
go
migwan
came
along
in
the
midst
of
the
preparation
and
announced
that
her
red
middy
tie
had
disappeared
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
her
mouth
when
hinpoha
came
in
declaring
that
her
bathing
cap
must
have
evaporated
for
it
was
gone
from
the
tent
ropes
where
she
had
left
it
the
girls
looked
at
one
another
with
consternation
in
their
faces
if
some
one
was
playing
a
joke
there
must
be
a
thief
in
camp
that
one
of
the
winnebagos
should
be
taking
the
other
girls
things
was
inconceivable
they
were
bound
to
each
other
by
bonds
stronger
than
sisterhood
they
knew
each
other
very
thoughts
almost
and
to
suspect
one
of
their
number
of
stealing
hurt
worse
than
a
blow
and
yet
here
were
their
things
disappearing
almost
under
their
hands
no
the
thing
was
impossible
what
would
one
winnebago
gain
by
taking
the
other
girls
clothes
she
could
not
wear
them
without
instant
detection
and
they
would
be
worth
nothing
if
sold
a
scarf
a
white
skirt
with
a
seam
burst
open
a
tie
with
a
spot
of
ink
in
it
a
bathing
cap
what
could
induce
any
one
to
take
them
the
thing
became
uncanny
nyoda
wondered
uncomfortably
how
long
sherry
had
been
in
camp
the
previous
night
before
he
had
made
himself
known
and
gladys
shuddered
at
the
possibility
of
ed
roberts
having
a
hand
in
it
each
time
things
had
disappeared
some
one
from
mountain
lake
camp
had
been
over
the
girls
had
been
in
the
habit
of
leaving
all
their
belongings
open
and
spread
around
with
never
a
thought
for
their
safety
but
now
they
began
putting
them
away
carefully
they
all
felt
uncomfortable
doing
it
and
each
one
hoped
she
was
unobserved
there
was
an
air
of
restraint
about
the
camp
that
had
never
existed
before
and
it
reacted
in
a
general
crossness
the
singing
in
the
evening
seemed
all
out
of
tune
and
the
fire
smoked
because
the
wood
was
damp
and
everything
had
a
false
note
in
it
nyoda
was
glad
when
it
was
time
to
blow
the
bugle
even
then
there
was
no
immediate
peace
no
sooner
were
they
settled
in
bed
than
from
the
lake
below
came
the
sound
of
a
manly
voice
raised
in
song
accompanied
by
the
strumming
of
a
guitar
there
your
lover
gladys
giggled
sahwah
i
recognize
his
voice
he
plays
the
guitar
his
brother
told
me
so
gladys
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
the
girls
kept
on
teasing
her
are
you
going
to
reward
your
gallant
troubadour
by
tossing
him
a
flower
or
a
glove
or
something
called
nyoda
from
the
other
tent
i
like
to
toss
him
a
rock
said
gladys
savagely
to
herself
finding
his
efforts
unrecognized
the
serenader
finally
desisted
and
they
heard
the
dipping
of
his
paddle
as
he
departed
the
girls
were
at
work
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
for
they
were
to
be
ready
to
leave
for
blueberry
island
by
nine
with
a
great
waving
of
paddles
the
boys
arrived
promptly
on
the
dot
and
jumped
out
to
help
stow
the
empty
baskets
for
berries
and
the
full
baskets
of
lunch
into
the
boats
together
with
the
cups
and
kettles
gladys
had
been
wondering
all
morning
how
she
should
treat
ed
roberts
and
stood
around
so
quiet
and
pensive
that
nyoda
rallied
her
on
her
lack
of
spirits
are
you
so
anxious
to
see
your
troubadour
that
you
forget
to
talk
she
asked
gladys
suddenly
grown
weary
of
all
this
teasing
said
vehemently
i
do
like
ed
roberts
and
i
wish
you
would
stop
talking
about
him
to
me
do
you
really
like
him
said
nyoda
grown
serious
in
an
instant
gladys
shook
her
head
he
thinks
i
should
talk
to
any
one
but
himself
and
he
forever
trying
to
get
me
off
into
corners
away
from
the
others
all
he
talks
is
nonsense
calls
me
and
and
actually
tried
to
hold
my
hand
when
we
were
going
down
to
the
canoes
that
night
it
makes
me
tired
i
wish
i
did
have
to
go
nyoda
puckered
her
brows
but
thought
best
not
to
treat
the
matter
too
seriously
and
merely
said
stay
near
me
all
day
and
i
do
think
he
will
act
that
way
there
were
sixteen
of
them
altogether
and
only
seven
canoes
counting
the
so
one
canoe
had
to
carry
four
when
nyoda
got
in
with
sherry
gladys
got
in
right
after
her
and
ed
roberts
who
was
trying
to
get
a
canoe
for
himself
either
had
to
get
in
also
or
let
some
one
else
have
the
place
he
chose
the
former
and
was
placed
as
bow
paddler
with
his
back
to
the
others
and
nyoda
between
him
and
gladys
the
day
was
perfect
and
every
one
in
high
spirits
the
berries
were
thick
on
the
island
and
the
baskets
were
filled
with
little
trouble
gladys
kept
close
to
nyoda
after
a
courteous
greeting
she
had
paid
no
further
attention
to
ed
and
during
the
picking
he
stayed
in
the
background
sulky
and
chagrined
when
the
berries
were
picked
gladys
went
to
help
nyoda
make
the
blueberry
pudding
which
was
to
crown
the
feast
sherry
sought
out
ed
roberts
you
big
boob
he
said
why
do
you
take
that
gladys
girl
away
from
miss
kent
and
keep
her
entertained
sticking
so
close
beside
her
i
have
no
chance
to
talk
at
all
where
are
your
manners
anyway
leaving
her
without
a
partner
ed
looked
at
him
sourly
and
then
he
brightened
at
the
prospect
of
having
sherry
for
an
ally
if
you
can
manage
to
lose
her
somewhere
near
me
i
be
delighted
he
said
but
gladys
steadfastly
refused
to
be
lost
and
nyoda
was
constantly
requiring
her
assistance
so
the
two
were
never
very
far
away
from
each
other
sahwah
and
ned
were
having
a
glorious
time
he
was
teaching
her
to
shoot
her
rifle
and
she
was
proving
a
very
apt
pupil
indeed
hitting
the
paper
three
times
out
of
five
the
first
round
not
so
hinpoha
who
was
also
being
taught
she
took
aim
with
her
left
eye
and
pulled
the
trigger
with
her
right
hand
and
the
result
was
that
she
could
not
even
hit
the
tree
on
which
the
paper
was
fastened
she
screwed
her
face
up
into
a
frightful
grimace
and
turned
her
head
away
when
she
fired
as
if
she
expected
the
explosion
to
blow
her
head
off
but
ned
gallantly
assured
her
that
she
would
be
a
good
shot
in
time
and
never
made
one
remark
about
the
way
girls
do
such
things
hinpoha
persisted
until
she
had
hit
the
paper
once
and
then
left
to
put
her
slumgullion
over
the
fire
assisted
by
lane
allen
who
had
followed
her
around
since
the
first
night
he
visited
the
camp
soon
dinner
was
ready
and
the
hungry
crowd
spread
out
on
the
rocks
to
be
served
with
good
things
cooked
over
the
open
fire
leave
room
for
blueberry
pudding
gladys
cautioned
every
one
viewing
with
alarm
the
quantities
of
slumgullion
and
sandwiches
that
were
being
consumed
no
danger
laughed
ned
i
could
eat
everything
in
sight
and
still
have
room
for
all
the
blueberry
pudding
you
have
bring
it
on
gladys
served
every
one
with
a
heaping
big
dish
and
with
and
ahs
of
enjoyment
they
sent
it
the
way
of
the
rest
of
the
feast
now
we
must
heat
water
to
wash
the
dishes
said
nyoda
when
every
one
had
reached
the
limit
of
eating
you
let
us
fellows
attend
to
that
said
sherry
decisively
it
enough
that
you
got
the
dinner
he
calmly
took
her
big
cook
apron
away
from
her
and
put
it
on
himself
the
boys
fell
to
with
a
will
and
the
dishes
were
soon
off
the
scene
in
the
afternoon
they
divided
the
company
into
two
parts
and
had
a
shooting
match
with
sahwah
rifle
some
of
the
girls
surprised
themselves
by
hitting
the
paper
the
first
time
and
more
than
one
hit
the
bull
eye
before
her
round
was
over
ed
roberts
called
out
the
wrath
of
sherry
because
he
would
point
the
gun
at
people
and
lost
his
turn
in
consequence
which
did
not
improve
his
temper
later
he
received
a
sharp
rebuke
from
sahwah
because
he
wanted
her
to
shoot
at
a
song
sparrow
and
retired
to
the
beach
by
himself
to
mope
he
was
no
more
like
his
frank
courteous
twin
brother
than
day
is
like
night
and
nyoda
understood
fully
gladys
aversion
to
him
they
went
paddling
home
in
the
rosy
sunset
singing
a
perfect
day
which
it
had
been
to
every
one
but
ed
roberts
all
vowing
that
they
must
get
together
again
before
the
camps
broke
up
long
after
the
others
were
wrapped
in
slumber
sahwah
lay
staring
into
the
moonlight
she
was
never
more
wide
awake
the
night
was
hot
and
the
blankets
seemed
to
stifle
her
i
ca
sleep
she
declared
to
herself
as
she
thumped
her
pillow
for
the
twentieth
time
i
going
to
get
up
awhile
she
stepped
softly
out
of
bed
slipped
on
her
sweater
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
tent
looking
out
into
the
night
by
and
by
her
feet
began
to
move
as
by
their
own
impulse
and
carried
her
down
the
path
to
the
lake
the
lay
on
the
beach
bathed
in
moonlight
and
scarcely
knowing
what
she
was
doing
she
drew
it
down
to
the
water
edge
launched
it
and
got
in
she
had
no
thought
of
disobeying
nyoda
by
going
out
after
bedtime
she
was
not
thinking
at
all
she
was
moving
in
a
sort
of
dream
it
was
one
of
those
strange
wild
fancies
that
seize
girls
in
their
teens
and
she
was
going
out
to
play
in
the
moonlight
like
an
elf
the
lake
exerted
its
magic
influence
over
her
and
drew
her
to
itself
when
awake
as
it
had
done
once
before
in
her
sleep
straight
across
the
lake
she
paddled
following
the
path
of
the
moonbeams
to
where
the
rocky
shore
reared
its
steep
cliffs
on
the
other
side
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
highest
cliffs
there
was
a
tiny
cave
and
into
this
sahwah
steered
the
inside
it
was
as
black
as
ink
and
so
low
that
she
had
to
bend
her
head
chaos
and
ancient
night
the
words
came
aimlessly
into
her
mind
from
afar
off
in
the
depths
of
the
cave
came
the
sound
of
water
falling
she
shuddered
at
the
awfulness
of
it
and
backed
the
canoe
out
during
those
minutes
she
had
spent
in
the
cave
a
change
had
come
over
the
moon
it
was
fast
becoming
veiled
and
a
heavy
mist
was
settling
on
the
lake
closing
around
her
like
a
mantle
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
where
she
was
nor
in
which
direction
she
was
going
the
spell
of
the
moonlight
was
gone
and
she
was
wide
awake
she
felt
chilly
and
very
much
afraid
she
lost
her
sense
of
direction
and
dared
not
steer
out
toward
the
middle
of
the
lake
but
kept
close
to
the
shore
following
the
sound
of
the
waves
as
they
dashed
on
the
rocks
a
strong
breeze
sprang
up
and
the
light
canoe
tossed
like
a
blossom
in
the
wind
on
and
on
around
that
great
curve
of
the
shore
line
she
paddled
until
her
arms
ached
from
the
strain
the
waves
flung
themselves
upon
the
rocks
with
a
horrible
moaning
sound
that
chilled
the
marrow
of
her
bones
then
came
the
weirdest
sensation
that
something
was
swimming
after
the
boat
it
was
really
only
the
swirls
made
by
the
rocks
below
but
in
that
queer
light
every
wave
seemed
topped
by
a
head
that
twisted
its
neck
after
her
and
then
started
in
pursuit
her
teeth
chattered
and
her
hands
trembled
so
she
could
hardly
hold
the
paddle
thus
passed
the
night
fearful
unreal
endless
when
morning
came
the
mists
began
to
lift
and
she
could
see
where
she
was
she
was
quite
close
to
camp
still
very
near
to
shore
she
had
paddled
halfway
around
the
circumference
of
the
lake
a
distance
of
nearly
twelve
miles
in
the
hush
of
dawn
she
beached
the
and
crept
up
to
bed
falling
asleep
immediately
from
exhaustion
no
one
knew
that
she
had
gone
out
and
she
never
told
any
one
not
even
nyoda
it
was
not
that
she
was
afraid
to
tell
nyoda
that
she
had
broken
bounds
but
the
whole
experience
seemed
so
unreal
to
her
that
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
ever
explain
it
at
all
she
knew
it
was
not
her
fault
and
at
the
same
time
she
knew
that
she
would
never
do
it
again
and
so
it
remained
a
secret
in
fact
in
a
few
days
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
had
not
dreamed
the
whole
thing
except
for
her
shoulder
which
was
lame
for
a
week
the
morning
after
sahwah
nocturnal
journey
the
camp
was
thrown
into
consternation
by
the
discovery
that
nyoda
sweater
was
gone
the
last
time
she
remembered
having
it
was
coming
home
from
blueberry
island
when
she
had
given
it
to
sherry
to
hold
while
she
unpacked
the
cups
from
the
canoes
this
was
the
first
thing
of
value
that
had
been
taken
but
it
might
not
be
the
last
and
nyoda
was
really
worried
sahwah
fine
furs
were
in
a
trunk
in
the
shack
along
with
the
rest
of
her
presents
and
she
remembered
with
a
start
that
sahwah
had
shown
them
all
to
the
boys
when
they
were
over
since
yesterday
a
distrust
of
ed
roberts
sprang
up
in
her
mind
and
she
wondered
if
there
could
be
any
connection
between
his
determined
hanging
around
the
camp
and
the
disappearance
of
the
articles
might
not
the
taking
of
the
unimportant
things
at
first
be
a
deliberate
blind
calling
sahwah
she
made
her
put
all
the
things
from
canada
in
the
trunk
and
locked
it
securely
after
first
weighting
it
down
with
stones
so
that
it
could
not
be
carried
away
bodily
by
less
than
six
men
a
short
time
later
sahwah
came
in
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
her
bathing
suit
was
gone
here
was
trouble
indeed
sahwah
would
have
been
sorry
if
the
furs
had
been
stolen
but
it
would
not
have
roused
her
half
so
much
as
the
taking
of
her
bathing
suit
sahwah
without
a
bathing
suit
was
like
a
horse
without
a
head
i
going
to
sit
up
all
night
and
watch
she
declared
we
all
sit
up
i
think
said
nyoda
if
the
thief
comes
again
he
find
a
bivouac
accordingly
that
night
they
all
stayed
up
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
the
shack
the
tents
were
plainly
visible
in
the
moonlight
the
place
was
as
calm
and
still
as
a
churchyard
and
did
not
look
as
if
it
could
be
the
scene
of
such
mysterious
doings
hour
after
hour
passed
and
nothing
happened
the
thief
had
evidently
changed
his
mind
the
girls
yawned
and
dozed
and
wished
they
were
in
bed
suddenly
there
was
a
crashing
in
the
underbrush
that
made
the
girls
sit
up
as
if
an
electric
shock
had
passed
through
them
with
a
rapid
snapping
of
dry
twigs
and
waving
of
tall
grass
the
bushes
parted
and
a
great
bernard
puppy
dashed
up
the
path
to
the
tents
seizing
a
bath
towel
that
hung
on
a
rope
he
worried
it
for
a
moment
with
his
jaws
and
then
made
off
with
it
in
the
direction
he
had
come
for
a
moment
astonishment
held
them
speechless
then
sahwah
broke
into
her
giggle
and
they
all
screamed
with
laughter
the
thought
of
the
weighted
trunk
overcame
them
and
they
doubled
up
weakly
on
the
shack
floor
ten
minutes
later
the
puppy
was
back
again
looking
for
something
else
to
chew
they
drove
him
off
with
switches
and
he
ran
yelping
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
he
never
came
again
i
do
doubt
but
what
we
find
all
our
belongings
scattered
through
the
woods
said
nyoda
which
was
exactly
the
case
a
search
by
daylight
disclosed
all
the
missing
articles
strewn
through
the
various
paths
and
hollows
all
more
or
less
chewed
but
still
recognizable
thus
the
specter
of
suspicion
that
had
been
hovering
over
the
camp
vanished
into
thin
air
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
gladys
had
made
her
feeling
toward
ed
roberts
perfectly
plain
the
nocturnal
serenades
continued
nightly
at
about
nine
they
would
hear
a
canoe
scrape
on
the
rocks
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
cliff
and
then
the
voice
and
the
guitar
would
begin
for
fifteen
minutes
or
more
the
songs
would
float
up
to
the
occupants
of
the
tents
and
then
the
serenader
would
paddle
away
the
girls
never
gave
any
sign
of
hearing
but
this
did
not
seem
to
discourage
the
singer
any
they
had
ceased
to
tease
gladys
about
ed
and
were
no
longer
thrilled
at
the
serenades
the
business
was
getting
monotonous
nyoda
thought
of
sending
word
over
to
the
head
of
the
boys
camp
and
having
him
put
a
stop
to
it
but
this
course
struck
her
as
ridiculous
and
she
determined
to
go
down
herself
the
next
night
and
send
ed
about
his
business
accordingly
when
the
first
strains
rose
from
the
lake
the
next
night
she
went
down
the
path
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
while
the
girls
above
listened
breathless
for
what
would
happen
she
saw
the
dim
figure
in
the
canoe
outlined
against
the
tall
rock
and
crossed
the
beach
toward
him
roberts
she
called
sharply
ed
roberts
the
singer
ceased
his
song
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
looked
around
nyoda
stopped
in
confusion
the
youth
in
the
boat
was
not
ed
roberts
it
was
sherry
the
senior
counsellor
you
came
down
at
last
he
said
joyfully
when
nyoda
returned
to
the
tents
the
girls
eagerly
demanded
to
know
what
he
had
said
but
she
waved
all
their
questions
and
sent
them
back
to
bed
only
to
gladys
will
he
stop
serenading
us
now
she
returned
a
short
yes
chapter
xi
on
shadow
river
the
long
awaited
canoe
trip
which
had
been
put
off
until
gladys
learned
to
swim
had
at
last
become
a
reality
and
bright
and
early
one
morning
the
winnebagos
started
off
on
a
paddle
up
the
shadow
river
sahwah
led
the
procession
in
the
uttering
shouts
which
she
fondly
believed
to
be
in
imitation
of
an
indian
warrior
her
new
hunting
knife
hung
at
one
side
of
her
belt
her
own
hatchet
on
the
other
while
the
rest
of
the
space
was
decorated
with
her
wohelo
knife
and
a
string
of
enormous
safety
pins
with
which
to
pin
her
blankets
together
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
reposed
her
rifle
nyoda
had
to
turn
her
head
away
to
hide
a
smile
when
she
saw
the
outfit
sahwah
looked
like
a
floating
cutlery
store
just
why
she
should
elect
to
impersonate
a
brave
instead
of
an
indian
maiden
was
not
clear
to
nyoda
but
this
was
only
another
illustration
of
her
whimsical
temperament
part
of
the
time
the
duties
appealed
to
her
the
care
of
the
hearthfire
the
cooking
and
cleaning
and
and
then
again
her
imagination
was
kindled
by
tales
of
scouts
and
warriors
and
she
longed
for
the
wild
life
of
the
hunter
migwan
on
the
other
hand
was
the
picture
of
shy
dreamy
girlhood
as
she
sat
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
herself
be
paddled
along
by
two
other
girls
so
she
might
have
her
hands
free
for
writing
down
her
impressions
of
the
trip
describing
it
in
a
letter
to
her
mother
she
wrote
i
am
packed
in
like
a
sardine
between
the
ponchos
and
supplies
can
you
imagine
me
sitting
in
an
inch
of
water
with
one
foot
straight
up
in
the
air
the
other
doubled
under
poncho
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
balance
placidly
doing
beadwork
it
is
quite
an
accomplishment
to
thread
a
needle
in
a
pitching
canoe
but
every
one
has
mastered
the
art
the
trip
up
the
shadow
river
was
ideally
beautiful
the
scenery
was
still
wild
and
natural
and
the
foliage
very
dense
many
of
the
trees
along
the
banks
had
four
or
five
trunks
and
leaned
far
out
over
the
water
making
the
shadows
which
gave
the
river
its
name
a
crane
startled
by
the
approach
of
the
canoes
rose
in
wheeling
flight
over
their
heads
the
willows
waved
their
feathery
boughs
in
the
sun
and
gleamed
bright
against
the
dark
background
of
the
pines
migwan
noted
down
the
different
contours
of
the
trees
how
the
elms
spread
out
wide
at
the
top
how
the
pines
tapered
to
a
point
how
the
maples
spread
out
irregularly
a
flock
of
wild
ducks
passed
them
in
some
places
the
banks
of
the
river
were
honeycombed
by
the
holes
of
bank
swallows
a
turtle
sitting
on
a
log
stretched
his
neck
and
looked
after
them
as
long
as
he
could
see
them
all
these
things
migwan
saw
and
set
down
in
her
book
with
a
quiet
enjoyment
a
ripple
of
excitement
ran
through
the
girls
as
they
saw
far
in
the
distance
the
big
river
steamer
approaching
shall
we
land
until
it
has
passed
called
sahwah
we
ca
land
here
answered
nyoda
the
banks
are
nothing
but
mud
and
slime
come
in
as
close
to
shore
as
possible
and
keep
paddling
so
the
waves
from
the
steamer
wo
swamp
you
the
big
passenger
boat
nearly
filled
the
river
from
bank
to
bank
but
she
came
very
slowly
and
the
waves
she
made
did
not
amount
to
much
after
all
the
people
on
board
ran
to
the
rail
with
their
cameras
to
snapshot
the
three
canoes
full
of
girls
a
birchbark
canoe
ahead
bearing
the
huntress
with
her
rifle
a
big
green
canoe
next
packed
with
ponchos
and
supplies
followed
by
a
canoe
with
sails
at
the
top
of
which
floated
the
winnebago
banner
sahwah
saluted
with
her
paddle
as
she
passed
the
other
girls
waved
their
handkerchiefs
in
friendly
greeting
farther
up
the
river
there
were
rapids
and
the
paddling
became
strenuous
indeed
the
sails
had
to
come
down
from
the
sailing
canoe
and
the
crew
who
had
been
having
an
easy
time
of
it
had
to
bend
to
their
paddles
with
all
their
might
going
through
a
rapid
requires
short
hard
strokes
in
swift
succession
to
make
any
headway
at
all
and
more
than
once
a
canoe
was
whirled
around
in
the
rushing
water
and
hurled
back
downstream
sahwah
was
having
a
great
time
she
pretended
that
she
was
in
the
rapids
of
the
niagara
paddling
for
her
life
and
put
forth
such
strenuous
efforts
that
she
soon
left
the
others
behind
the
girls
were
so
tired
by
the
time
they
reached
calm
waters
again
that
nyoda
ordered
them
to
land
on
a
low
green
bank
and
rest
for
an
hour
they
built
a
fire
and
cooked
their
dinner
and
then
stretched
themselves
in
the
shade
of
a
large
oak
tree
for
a
nap
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
on
every
side
there
was
no
trace
of
a
human
being
no
house
no
boat
no
cultivated
land
it
was
as
though
they
had
stepped
back
a
hundred
years
and
were
in
the
midst
of
the
primeval
forest
of
song
and
story
migwan
lay
on
her
back
in
lazy
contentment
watching
the
sunshine
filter
through
the
leaves
idly
she
drew
out
her
pencil
and
began
scribbling
words
in
her
notebook
underneath
this
spreading
tree
let
us
rest
luxuriously
and
caressed
by
breezes
mild
and
with
song
of
birds
beguiled
interweave
our
bright
day
dream
with
a
tale
of
wondrous
theme
up
up
comrades
cried
nyoda
rising
and
returning
to
her
canoe
all
through
the
lovely
golden
afternoon
they
paddled
steadily
upstream
and
just
about
sunset
landed
on
a
low
green
meadow
that
ran
down
to
the
water
edge
behind
the
tiny
plain
the
woods
grew
high
and
dark
sahwah
watching
the
other
girls
picking
out
their
sleeping
sites
for
the
night
had
an
inspiration
may
i
sleep
out
in
the
she
asked
nyoda
why
yes
said
nyoda
if
you
will
tie
it
securely
to
a
tree
the
current
is
pretty
strong
they
lingered
long
around
the
camp
fire
that
night
telling
stories
and
watching
the
moon
rise
over
the
treetops
none
of
them
had
ever
experienced
that
feeling
of
being
so
absolutely
by
themselves
quiet
and
unmolested
as
camp
winnebago
was
it
seemed
the
center
of
civilization
compared
to
this
migwan
who
was
in
a
poetical
mood
made
up
a
new
camp
fire
song
and
taught
it
to
the
girls
lofty
pine
tree
old
and
grim
with
the
horned
moon
hooked
round
the
topmost
limb
and
the
owl
awatch
on
the
branch
below
what
is
the
song
of
the
winds
that
blow
through
your
boughs
so
mysteriously
they
sing
a
song
of
the
wide
green
world
of
the
leaves
in
the
merry
breezes
whirled
and
rustle
and
murmur
and
moan
and
sigh
of
the
storm
that
darkened
the
sunny
sky
and
the
ship
that
was
lost
at
sea
lofty
pine
tree
lone
and
grim
with
the
moon
peering
over
the
topmost
limb
and
the
owl
asleep
on
the
branch
below
what
is
the
song
of
the
winds
that
blow
through
your
twigs
so
caressingly
before
rolling
into
their
beds
they
all
went
for
a
moonlight
swim
in
the
river
which
each
girl
declared
to
be
the
most
wonderful
experience
of
her
life
no
outdoor
bed
is
quite
so
comfortable
as
a
grassy
meadow
and
the
winnebagos
settled
themselves
with
sighs
of
contentment
in
her
letter
to
her
mother
migwan
wrote
i
have
never
seen
such
cloud
pictures
as
i
saw
that
night
once
it
looked
as
if
a
priest
were
holding
the
moon
before
him
like
a
basin
while
a
polar
bear
stood
upright
beside
him
his
paws
resting
on
a
carved
pillar
once
it
seemed
as
if
the
moon
were
about
to
enter
a
vast
cavern
at
the
door
of
which
stood
the
figure
of
a
youth
with
hands
outstretched
in
welcome
the
moon
paused
before
the
door
but
did
not
enter
the
youth
slid
to
the
ground
and
crouched
with
head
on
knee
in
an
attitude
of
despair
a
gigantic
figure
stood
out
in
the
light
before
him
danced
a
circle
of
elves
the
figure
in
the
doorway
leaned
back
and
slept
watching
this
strange
panorama
i
fell
asleep
nyoda
awoke
before
sunrise
and
sat
up
to
see
if
the
rest
were
all
right
all
those
girls
sleeping
on
the
ground
looked
like
an
army
she
could
not
help
wondering
would
it
ever
come
to
that
in
earnest
was
this
training
of
the
camp
fire
girls
all
over
the
country
a
prophetic
flash
she
looked
fondly
around
at
her
charges
hinpoha
and
migwan
were
sleeping
together
and
the
bed
would
hardly
hold
them
both
were
still
sound
asleep
and
both
mechanically
swatting
mosquitoes
in
their
sleep
at
the
foot
of
her
own
bed
the
winnebago
banner
was
stuck
into
the
ground
keeping
silent
guard
gladys
bed
had
come
apart
and
her
bare
feet
were
sticking
out
between
the
ponchos
nyoda
lay
back
for
another
nap
to
waken
when
the
rising
sun
shone
in
her
face
she
sat
up
again
and
this
time
she
beheld
a
curious
sight
one
of
the
ponchos
tied
up
in
a
long
roll
suddenly
rose
in
the
air
and
after
waving
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
slowly
descended
smothered
giggles
burst
from
the
beds
about
again
the
phenomenon
occurred
nyoda
jumped
up
suddenly
seizing
the
poncho
she
shook
it
and
a
head
appeared
at
the
bottom
end
it
was
hinpoha
the
girls
had
rolled
her
into
her
poncho
and
tied
it
up
and
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
with
her
legs
in
the
air
when
nyoda
first
spied
her
it
was
two
hours
before
rising
time
but
the
girls
were
all
wide
awake
and
ready
for
larks
they
sat
up
in
bed
and
began
to
throw
shoes
at
each
other
until
nyoda
in
sheer
blew
the
rising
bugle
the
river
was
hidden
from
the
girls
by
a
heavy
fringe
of
willows
and
sahwah
had
not
joined
in
the
early
morning
frolic
when
she
did
not
appear
at
the
sound
of
the
bugle
nyoda
went
down
to
call
her
there
was
no
sign
of
the
nyoda
knew
well
that
sahwah
would
not
have
paddled
off
by
herself
without
saying
anything
the
canoe
had
broken
away
and
floated
downstream
while
she
was
asleep
calling
hinpoha
to
come
and
paddle
bow
nyoda
launched
a
canoe
and
started
in
pursuit
a
great
fear
tugged
at
her
heart
the
rapids
the
first
one
was
not
three
miles
down
what
if
sahwah
should
not
wake
up
in
time
to
see
her
danger
with
powerful
strokes
she
sent
the
canoe
flying
downstream
fifteen
anxious
minutes
passed
and
then
they
saw
the
floating
merrily
along
ahead
of
them
with
the
rope
trailing
out
behind
it
and
sahwah
still
sound
asleep
in
the
bottom
they
caught
the
runaway
and
sahwah
sat
up
in
great
surprise
sahwah
said
nyoda
severely
is
that
the
best
you
can
tie
you
come
back
to
camp
and
tie
fifty
secure
before
you
get
a
bite
of
breakfast
migwan
fully
dressed
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
river
admiring
the
scenery
without
moment
warning
the
ground
gave
way
under
her
feet
and
she
tumbled
headlong
into
the
water
it
was
only
up
to
her
waist
but
the
suddenness
of
the
slide
took
her
breath
away
and
she
blinked
dazedly
at
the
laughing
girls
recovering
herself
however
she
asked
them
to
throw
her
her
toothbrush
as
she
might
as
well
finish
her
toilet
while
she
had
the
water
so
handy
an
instant
later
gladys
was
in
trouble
watch
me
dive
she
called
and
sprang
from
the
bank
the
water
was
shallow
and
the
bottom
soft
and
her
head
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
while
her
feet
waved
in
the
air
she
was
rescued
from
her
uncomfortable
position
her
face
and
hair
plastered
with
mud
next
hinpoha
swimming
under
water
with
the
swift
current
struck
her
head
against
a
log
and
emerged
with
a
great
bruise
nyoda
trying
to
get
the
pancake
batter
ready
for
breakfast
was
nearly
distracted
with
this
swift
succession
of
accidents
every
one
of
you
come
here
and
sit
in
a
row
beside
me
she
commanded
and
the
first
one
that
causes
any
excitement
until
breakfast
is
over
will
get
spanked
what
a
lovely
cave
exclaimed
migwan
later
when
they
were
exploring
the
woods
it
a
regular
witch
cave
nyoda
you
dress
up
like
a
witch
and
tell
our
fortunes
nyoda
consented
and
the
girls
scoured
the
woods
for
hanging
moss
to
decorate
the
cave
and
for
pine
cones
to
build
a
charmed
fire
they
were
busily
transforming
the
bare
rocks
into
a
green
tapestried
chamber
when
sahwah
came
up
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
carrying
in
her
arms
a
dead
wild
duck
what
the
matter
asked
nyoda
in
alarm
i
shot
it
sobbed
sahwah
but
that
nothing
to
cry
about
said
nyoda
do
you
know
that
wild
ducks
are
game
birds
it
a
bit
out
of
season
and
you
must
shoot
any
more
but
i
must
congratulate
you
on
your
aim
sahwah
was
a
living
riddle
to
her
fearless
as
an
indian
in
the
woods
and
possessing
the
skill
with
a
rifle
to
bring
down
a
bird
on
the
wing
she
was
so
that
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
having
killed
any
living
thing
nyoda
bade
her
cheer
up
and
pluck
the
fowl
for
roasting
and
the
girls
danced
for
joy
at
the
thought
of
the
feast
in
store
for
them
they
left
off
decorating
the
cave
and
went
to
constructing
a
stone
oven
in
which
to
cook
the
bird
it
was
a
bit
scorched
on
the
outside
when
done
but
the
meat
was
so
tender
it
nearly
fell
apart
sahwah
who
at
first
wanted
to
bury
the
martyr
with
full
honors
changed
her
mind
when
she
smelled
the
savory
odor
and
enjoyed
the
dinner
as
much
as
the
rest
when
night
fell
the
girls
repaired
one
by
one
to
the
cave
in
the
woods
to
have
their
fortunes
read
nyoda
clad
in
her
gray
bathrobe
in
lieu
of
a
witch
cloak
trimmed
with
streamers
of
ground
pine
and
with
a
hat
with
a
pine
tassel
on
top
was
a
weird
figure
as
she
bent
over
the
low
fire
stirring
her
kettle
and
muttering
incantations
she
read
such
amazing
things
in
the
extended
palms
that
the
truth
seekers
eyes
began
to
pop
out
of
their
heads
the
grinning
toothless
old
hag
nyoda
had
blackened
all
her
teeth
but
one
was
so
realistic
that
they
had
to
look
closely
to
make
sure
that
it
was
their
beloved
friend
and
not
a
real
witch
near
by
sahwah
and
hinpoha
were
conducting
a
turkish
bath
for
the
entertainment
of
the
girls
who
were
through
having
their
fortunes
told
they
had
built
a
shelter
of
ponchos
and
had
a
fire
going
they
heated
small
stones
red
hot
and
then
plunged
them
into
a
pail
of
water
the
resulting
steam
heated
the
tiny
chamber
and
threw
the
patients
into
a
dripping
perspiration
which
limbered
up
their
muscles
which
were
stiff
from
paddling
they
took
the
turkish
bath
in
their
bathing
suits
and
went
into
the
river
immediately
afterward
so
as
not
to
take
cold
nyoda
was
the
last
customer
and
helped
take
down
the
ponchos
and
as
sahwah
and
hinpoha
had
their
beds
to
make
up
she
sent
migwan
to
put
out
the
fire
instead
of
putting
it
out
immediately
migwan
sat
down
to
dream
fire
dreams
until
nyoda
called
her
to
come
to
bed
hastily
scattering
the
fire
brands
with
her
feet
she
ran
in
obedience
to
nyoda
call
and
the
camp
was
soon
wrapped
in
slumber
in
the
place
where
the
fire
had
been
a
tiny
spark
lay
on
a
dry
leaf
soon
there
was
only
a
little
curl
of
smoke
where
the
leaf
had
been
and
the
spark
looked
around
for
another
leaf
to
eat
up
he
found
it
and
then
put
his
teeth
into
a
pine
cone
from
a
tiny
spark
he
had
grown
to
a
hungry
flame
the
pine
cone
crackled
and
snapped
and
jumped
into
a
dry
pine
tree
that
lay
nearby
in
a
few
minutes
the
twigs
were
burning
merrily
and
the
flame
was
twice
as
big
as
when
sahwah
was
heating
stones
then
the
wind
came
along
and
carried
a
flock
of
sparks
into
another
dry
tree
and
that
one
outdid
the
other
and
made
a
still
bigger
blaze
the
ground
was
covered
with
dry
sticks
and
pine
cones
and
the
fire
leaped
along
with
giant
strides
then
it
did
a
cruel
thing
it
caught
hold
of
a
living
pine
tree
and
thrust
its
fiery
tongues
deep
into
its
bark
after
that
it
took
no
heed
whether
a
tree
was
living
or
dead
whole
families
of
tender
green
needles
blazed
up
together
and
when
they
fled
into
the
arms
of
their
relatives
for
shelter
started
them
blazing
too
nyoda
waking
suddenly
from
a
dream
sat
up
and
saw
the
glare
in
the
woods
and
blew
the
alarm
call
on
the
bugle
in
an
instant
the
girls
were
awake
and
saw
what
was
the
matter
getting
quickly
into
their
bloomers
and
sweaters
instead
of
white
middies
they
dipped
into
the
river
to
get
wet
all
over
and
then
ran
for
the
blazing
woods
the
fire
was
spreading
alarmingly
through
the
underbrush
and
nyoda
set
half
the
girls
to
clearing
away
the
dry
wood
in
the
path
of
the
flames
while
the
others
threw
water
into
the
blazing
trees
and
beat
the
fire
with
wet
ponchos
sahwah
worked
like
a
trojan
with
her
hatchet
cutting
down
young
trees
bodily
and
hurling
them
out
of
the
way
every
now
and
then
a
shower
of
blazing
pine
needles
would
envelop
the
workers
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
wet
clothes
and
hair
they
would
have
been
in
constant
peril
of
blazing
up
themselves
it
took
several
hours
of
the
liveliest
fighting
before
the
last
spark
was
extinguished
and
the
danger
past
now
then
said
nyoda
when
they
had
washed
their
blackened
hands
and
faces
who
had
charge
of
putting
out
the
camp
fire
last
night
i
did
said
migwan
in
a
small
voice
you
a
fire
maker
said
nyoda
unbelievingly
that
was
all
she
said
but
migwan
crept
away
overwhelmed
with
shame
the
privilege
of
tending
the
fire
was
counted
an
honor
among
the
winnebagos
to
let
a
fire
go
out
that
you
had
been
set
to
watch
or
to
leave
a
fire
not
properly
extinguished
was
a
disgrace
migwan
learned
an
effective
lesson
that
night
about
the
consequences
of
dreaming
when
she
should
have
been
doing
nyoda
thought
that
the
girls
would
be
tired
out
the
next
morning
after
their
strenuous
midnight
exercise
and
planned
to
let
them
sleep
several
hours
later
than
usual
but
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
sun
on
the
river
they
were
wide
awake
and
impatient
to
get
up
pulling
downstream
seemed
like
play
after
having
come
up
and
going
through
the
rapids
with
the
current
was
a
delirious
delight
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
keep
the
canoe
headed
straight
migwan
paddled
on
the
trip
home
and
hinpoha
sat
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
doing
beadwork
hi
you
up
in
front
called
the
girls
in
the
sailing
canoe
look
at
the
way
the
wind
is
filling
out
our
sails
hinpoha
turned
to
look
and
shifted
her
weight
which
was
considerable
to
the
side
of
the
canoe
the
result
was
inevitable
and
in
a
moment
the
three
girls
were
in
the
river
the
water
was
not
very
deep
here
and
they
were
able
to
touch
bottom
migwan
and
gladys
set
to
work
righting
the
canoe
and
fishing
out
the
ponchos
the
current
caught
hinpoha
bead
loom
and
it
went
sailing
merrily
downstream
with
hinpoha
in
hot
pursuit
the
girls
shouted
as
they
watched
her
how
did
you
happen
to
tip
over
asked
nyoda
when
they
were
back
in
the
canoe
and
the
line
had
proceeded
again
i
just
looked
back
to
see
your
sails
said
hinpoha
like
this
she
craned
her
neck
back
to
show
nyoda
what
she
had
done
and
presto
over
went
the
canoe
again
is
the
water
delicious
she
cried
lazily
swimming
in
with
a
poncho
in
tow
let
all
go
in
said
sahwah
we
have
our
bathing
suits
on
anyway
nyoda
gave
the
word
and
the
girls
hopped
into
the
water
like
frogs
swam
around
for
a
while
and
then
got
back
into
the
canoes
where
the
sun
soon
dried
their
bathing
suits
and
so
they
paddled
on
mile
after
mile
singing
laughing
talking
following
the
winding
course
of
the
river
down
to
its
mouth
and
back
into
the
wide
waters
of
loon
lake
toward
the
camp
which
they
had
come
to
speak
of
as
home
the
boys
of
mountain
lake
camp
having
their
swimming
hour
saw
the
three
canoes
passing
out
in
the
lake
and
heard
the
song
of
the
girls
floating
in
on
the
wind
as
their
voices
kept
time
to
the
dipping
of
their
paddles
oh
the
laughing
life
oh
the
joyous
strife
as
my
paddlers
struggling
bend
low
and
the
big
rocks
sing
to
the
river
king
and
the
waters
forever
flow
chapter
xii
now
our
camp
fire
burning
low
it
does
seem
possible
that
the
summer
is
nearly
over
and
we
are
going
home
next
week
said
migwan
it
seems
like
only
yesterday
that
we
came
and
yet
somehow
i
feel
as
if
we
had
always
been
here
together
wo
it
seem
queer
not
to
be
eating
and
sleeping
together
any
more
the
winnebagos
were
taking
a
walk
down
the
road
that
ran
along
beside
the
woods
seeking
specimens
of
flowers
and
weeds
they
could
not
help
noticing
the
changes
in
the
trees
and
flowers
along
the
way
many
of
the
leaves
were
already
crimson
and
the
wild
asters
were
blooming
in
profusion
everywhere
the
air
had
the
cool
crisp
clearness
of
autumn
the
sky
had
become
that
deep
blue
which
marks
the
passing
of
summer
and
the
clouds
seemed
thicker
in
texture
the
girls
drank
in
the
air
in
great
draughts
like
strong
new
wine
rejoicing
in
the
glorious
weather
yet
it
made
them
feel
sad
because
it
meant
that
this
most
wonderful
of
all
summers
was
very
near
its
end
this
would
probably
be
their
last
nature
walk
and
the
girls
were
taking
a
sample
of
every
growing
thing
that
looked
in
the
least
promising
and
snapshotting
all
the
dear
familiar
scenes
to
be
taken
home
and
shown
to
friends
and
the
events
connected
with
them
lived
over
again
in
the
telling
nyoda
and
sahwah
covering
the
ground
with
their
swift
stride
soon
left
the
others
far
behind
we
really
ought
to
wait
for
the
girls
said
nyoda
coming
to
a
halt
when
she
discovered
that
they
were
so
far
in
the
lead
and
seating
herself
on
a
stone
fence
she
helped
herself
to
the
blackberries
which
grew
against
it
and
held
out
a
handful
to
sahwah
opposite
them
was
an
old
house
weatherbeaten
and
bare
of
paint
its
empty
window
sashes
gaping
like
eyeless
sockets
the
girls
had
named
it
the
haunted
house
and
wove
many
a
tale
of
mystery
about
it
beside
it
was
an
apple
orchard
its
trees
dying
of
old
age
and
under
one
of
them
was
a
grave
with
a
headstone
nyoda
swung
her
heels
against
the
stone
wall
and
contemplated
this
gaunt
remnant
of
other
days
she
glanced
down
the
road
to
see
if
the
girls
were
coming
they
were
not
yet
in
sight
sahwah
she
said
in
a
tone
that
proclaimed
a
sudden
inspiration
i
you
to
go
into
the
haunted
house
and
make
ghostly
noises
when
the
girls
come
along
sahwah
needed
no
urging
to
undertake
a
mission
of
this
kind
hand
in
hand
the
two
stole
across
the
road
and
climbed
in
one
of
the
windows
of
the
house
the
door
locked
years
ago
was
still
holding
its
ground
against
intruders
the
room
they
stepped
into
was
empty
save
for
an
old
spinning
wheel
thick
with
dust
and
cobwebs
which
stood
in
the
corner
the
floor
echoed
hollowly
to
their
footsteps
and
instinctively
they
rose
up
on
tiptoe
to
stop
the
noise
thus
they
walked
cautiously
about
making
believe
that
they
were
followed
by
ghostly
footsteps
and
clinging
to
each
other
in
mock
terror
there
was
a
closed
door
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
nyoda
whispered
dramatically
in
one
minute
that
door
will
swing
open
and
a
ghostly
hand
will
be
thrust
in
she
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
the
door
did
swing
open
and
a
hand
clutching
a
paint
brush
came
through
nyoda
gave
a
fine
shriek
and
fell
over
backwards
as
if
fainting
the
hand
was
followed
by
a
body
and
a
head
what
the
devil
said
a
voice
excuse
me
ladies
what
the
devil
finding
that
the
haunted
house
was
haunted
by
a
painter
they
returned
to
the
road
and
resumed
their
seat
on
the
fence
to
wait
for
the
girls
thus
the
days
slipped
by
each
more
lovely
than
the
last
filled
to
the
brim
with
joyous
incidents
that
would
linger
in
the
memories
of
the
girls
as
long
as
they
lived
one
of
the
big
events
of
this
last
week
was
the
dancing
party
given
for
them
by
the
mountain
lake
boys
the
boys
big
assembly
hall
was
decorated
with
flags
in
honor
of
the
occasion
in
addition
to
the
trophies
and
banners
lining
the
walls
which
mountain
lake
camp
had
won
in
athletic
and
aquatic
contests
with
other
camps
hinpoha
and
gladys
were
easily
the
belles
of
the
ball
and
had
so
many
partners
to
choose
from
that
it
was
hard
choosing
sahwah
said
afterward
that
she
was
glad
she
was
not
so
popular
because
she
did
not
have
to
spend
so
much
time
splitting
dances
up
and
consequently
had
more
time
to
dance
now
all
the
girls
were
glad
indeed
for
gladys
rigorous
coaching
for
they
were
complimented
on
every
side
upon
their
different
way
of
dancing
nyoda
fell
in
love
with
little
manuel
a
spanish
boy
from
cuba
it
was
his
first
visit
to
america
and
his
first
experience
with
american
boys
and
he
often
felt
very
homesick
nyoda
with
her
dark
hair
and
eyes
reminded
him
of
the
young
women
at
home
and
he
warmed
to
her
like
an
old
friend
i
like
not
the
baseball
he
confided
when
she
inquired
as
to
his
favorite
sports
i
like
the
high
joomp
he
and
nyoda
danced
together
so
much
that
sherry
regretted
his
intercession
with
the
camp
director
that
the
little
boys
be
allowed
to
stay
up
all
evening
gladys
had
arranged
a
fancy
dance
taking
in
all
of
the
girls
which
they
presented
during
the
course
of
the
evening
the
music
for
it
was
the
beautiful
blue
danube
waltz
and
the
girls
impersonated
in
their
dance
the
danube
river
winding
through
its
green
valley
the
girls
dressed
in
light
green
were
the
river
itself
while
gladys
in
a
filmy
white
dress
with
water
lilies
twined
in
her
long
yellow
hair
was
the
spirit
of
the
danube
and
frolicked
among
the
rhythmically
swaying
girls
like
a
real
river
nymph
on
the
rocking
waves
of
the
mighty
stream
their
dance
brought
down
the
house
and
the
girls
were
obliged
to
do
it
three
times
before
they
would
stop
applauding
ed
roberts
watched
with
jealous
eyes
as
gladys
glided
off
with
one
or
another
of
the
boys
but
beyond
the
one
dance
she
granted
him
for
politeness
sake
she
paid
no
further
attention
to
him
and
he
retired
to
the
side
lines
to
scowl
upon
the
gay
scene
the
evening
drew
to
a
close
all
too
quickly
and
the
boys
and
girls
parted
with
many
regrets
and
promises
to
write
the
next
day
the
mountain
lake
boys
broke
camp
and
departed
for
their
homes
and
the
girls
gathered
on
the
dock
to
see
the
steamer
go
by
there
was
a
great
waving
of
handkerchiefs
when
the
rounded
the
cliff
o
look
what
they
doing
gasped
sahwah
as
a
commotion
rose
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
the
boys
had
seized
one
of
their
number
and
were
dragging
him
to
the
rail
in
spite
of
vigorous
resistance
superior
forces
won
out
and
he
went
overboard
with
a
mighty
splash
in
accordance
with
an
immemorial
custom
of
the
mountain
lake
camp
that
at
least
one
boy
be
thrown
into
the
water
with
his
city
clothes
on
the
boy
did
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
but
climbed
aboard
again
perfectly
and
waved
his
dripping
hat
at
the
girls
until
a
bend
in
the
shore
line
hid
them
from
sight
o
dear
cried
migwan
to
think
that
the
next
time
the
comes
we
get
aboard
her
and
sail
out
through
the
gap
and
leave
dear
camp
winnebago
behind
forever
but
nyoda
would
not
let
them
be
sad
even
though
it
was
all
coming
to
an
end
and
kept
up
such
a
perfect
whirl
of
merrymaking
that
they
did
not
have
any
time
to
think
of
the
evil
day
so
near
at
hand
seeing
sahwah
sitting
pensively
on
the
dock
one
day
she
fastened
a
rope
to
the
launch
and
bade
her
hang
on
to
it
and
then
drove
the
launch
around
in
swift
circles
sahwah
shot
through
the
water
like
a
torpedo
holding
on
for
dear
life
and
shrieking
with
excitement
the
other
girls
came
running
at
the
sound
and
demanded
to
be
towed
likewise
and
soon
the
launch
had
a
tail
like
a
kite
that
swished
along
at
a
fearful
rate
leaving
a
long
foaming
ridge
in
its
wake
until
one
by
one
the
joy
riders
dropped
off
and
swam
ashore
the
nights
were
very
cool
now
and
the
girls
required
sweaters
and
sometimes
blankets
when
they
sat
on
the
high
rocks
after
sundown
and
watched
the
stars
rise
over
the
lake
nakwisi
was
in
constant
demand
in
those
star
watches
to
introduce
the
girls
to
their
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
sky
and
under
her
guidance
they
soon
learned
where
to
look
for
corona
arcturus
the
twins
spica
vega
regulus
and
all
the
gentle
summer
stars
the
wide
open
spaces
of
the
sky
over
the
lake
were
a
constant
delight
to
nakwisi
and
she
kept
saying
what
a
joy
it
is
not
to
have
your
favorite
constellation
cut
in
half
by
a
chimney
or
a
telegraph
pole
willingly
she
told
over
and
over
again
the
story
of
castor
and
pollux
of
the
great
bear
and
the
little
bear
of
cassiopeia
and
corona
borealis
they
were
thrilled
night
after
night
when
scorpio
sprawled
his
great
length
over
the
hilltops
with
fiery
antares
glowing
like
a
jewel
in
his
shell
they
traced
out
the
filmy
scarf
of
the
milky
way
and
recalled
the
indian
legend
of
this
being
the
pathway
of
the
departed
spirits
nakwisi
told
another
tale
about
two
lovers
who
were
separated
in
death
and
placed
on
different
spheres
and
who
built
the
milky
way
as
a
bridge
so
they
could
communicate
with
each
other
nyoda
had
taught
the
girls
the
three
ways
the
indians
had
of
testing
eyesight
namely
by
reproducing
the
spots
on
the
rabbit
counting
the
pleiades
and
spying
out
the
little
companion
star
to
the
one
in
the
handle
of
the
big
dipper
the
pair
which
the
arabs
call
the
horse
and
rider
and
the
girls
would
not
rest
until
they
too
had
caught
sight
of
the
tiny
point
of
light
and
in
learning
to
know
the
stars
they
were
doing
much
more
than
just
that
they
were
making
friends
whom
they
would
always
keep
and
love
and
who
would
greet
them
with
the
same
cheery
twinkle
wherever
they
were
rich
or
poor
or
joyful
or
sad
as
surely
as
the
seasons
came
round
the
camp
book
was
finished
and
sent
off
to
professor
bentley
with
its
clever
descriptions
and
cunning
illustrations
bound
in
a
leather
cover
with
the
winnebago
symbol
on
the
front
the
doings
and
adventures
recounted
in
it
made
it
very
thick
and
heavy
and
yet
there
were
so
many
things
they
had
planned
to
do
that
were
left
undone
we
never
had
our
sleeping
party
on
the
bartletts
lawn
said
migwan
regretfully
do
you
remember
said
sahwah
suddenly
grown
reminiscent
when
we
were
waiting
for
gladys
to
come
you
said
she
was
going
to
be
your
affinity
and
i
was
afraid
she
would
never
look
at
me
at
all
and
sahwah
smiled
happily
for
if
gladys
had
any
affinity
at
all
it
certainly
was
sahwah
herself
meanwhile
gladys
and
nyoda
were
sitting
up
on
the
sunset
rock
looking
out
over
the
water
and
enjoying
their
own
thoughts
the
lake
was
absolutely
calm
except
for
a
few
long
ripples
like
folds
in
satin
a
motor
boat
cutting
through
left
a
long
tail
like
a
peacock
there
was
a
faint
rosy
tint
on
the
water
as
if
the
lake
were
blushing
at
the
consciousness
of
her
own
loveliness
nyoda
noted
idly
that
the
rocks
under
the
water
looked
warm
and
green
those
above
cold
and
gray
nyoda
said
gladys
what
is
it
dear
answered
nyoda
taking
her
eyes
from
the
lake
i
been
thinking
a
great
deal
of
late
went
on
gladys
about
what
i
shall
do
this
winter
you
know
mother
has
her
heart
set
on
my
finishing
at
miss
russell
school
but
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
see
what
i
have
lost
by
not
going
to
the
public
high
school
so
in
my
last
letter
to
papa
i
asked
him
if
i
might
not
go
to
public
school
the
last
two
years
and
i
now
have
his
answer
she
spread
out
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
nyoda
it
read
my
dear
daughter
nothing
could
please
me
more
than
your
request
to
take
the
last
two
years
of
your
high
school
work
in
the
public
school
instead
of
at
miss
russell
although
i
must
say
your
mother
made
a
considerable
fuss
at
first
on
account
of
the
various
classes
of
girls
you
would
be
thrown
with
however
she
thought
better
of
the
plan
when
she
heard
that
your
little
friend
sahwah
is
a
brewster
of
the
samuel
brewsters
and
this
hinpoha
person
you
are
so
fond
of
is
judge
bradford
granddaughter
as
long
as
miss
kent
is
a
teacher
in
the
high
school
and
takes
such
an
interest
in
you
there
is
no
objection
on
our
part
to
your
going
on
to
school
in
the
company
of
your
new
friends
you
are
old
enough
to
choose
your
companions
so
from
now
on
it
going
to
be
to
you
lovingly
your
daddy
my
dear
child
said
nyoda
this
is
certainly
good
news
i
have
wanted
very
much
to
have
you
continue
in
the
winnebago
group
this
winter
but
thought
of
course
this
was
impossible
as
you
were
going
away
to
school
how
glad
i
am
their
hands
met
in
a
warm
clasp
setting
a
new
seal
on
their
friendship
the
girls
who
had
begun
to
dread
the
separation
from
gladys
were
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
having
her
in
school
with
them
to
think
said
sahwah
that
i
have
lived
in
the
next
block
to
you
for
fifteen
years
and
never
knew
you
until
now
hoffman
was
very
sorry
indeed
to
say
goodbye
to
sahwah
you
vill
write
to
me
yes
he
begged
in
vinter
i
lif
in
boston
in
such
a
street
and
he
scribbled
the
address
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
and
if
you
should
break
any
more
bones
you
let
me
know
and
i
vill
come
and
tie
dem
up
then
came
the
last
council
fire
at
camp
with
misty
eyes
they
rose
to
sing
mystic
fire
once
more
under
the
spell
of
the
forest
with
hand
uplifted
we
claim
thy
power
guide
and
keep
us
as
we
go
true
to
wohelo
thy
law
is
our
law
from
this
hour
thy
mystic
spirit
flame
will
show
us
the
way
to
go
the
glow
of
their
faces
was
not
entirely
from
the
fire
which
flickered
over
them
as
they
danced
but
was
mingled
with
the
light
of
that
inner
flame
of
wohelo
which
had
been
kindled
in
their
hearts
and
which
would
mould
and
color
their
whole
lives
gladys
was
to
be
made
a
fire
maker
at
this
council
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
bestowing
of
rank
nyoda
called
for
kamama
the
butterfly
to
stand
and
present
her
qualifications
gladys
stood
and
before
the
initiation
began
asked
if
she
might
make
a
request
nyoda
nodded
and
gladys
asked
if
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
change
her
camp
fire
name
state
your
reason
said
nyoda
if
it
is
a
plausible
one
the
change
is
permissible
gladys
spoke
in
a
firm
clear
voice
when
i
was
choosing
my
name
i
took
the
butterfly
because
it
was
such
a
pretty
design
to
put
on
my
dress
and
not
because
it
meant
anything
to
me
i
do
not
wish
to
be
known
as
the
butterfly
any
longer
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
take
the
name
geyahi
which
means
woman
your
reason
is
a
good
and
sufficient
one
said
nyoda
and
you
may
make
the
change
then
followed
the
pretty
ceremony
of
taking
a
new
camp
fire
name
the
old
one
was
written
on
a
piece
of
birchbark
and
put
in
the
fire
to
signify
that
it
was
to
be
in
existence
no
longer
and
as
it
burned
the
girls
all
pronounced
the
new
name
in
concert
and
promised
to
forget
the
old
one
proudly
gladys
displayed
her
fourteen
required
honors
and
her
twenty
others
and
passed
her
examination
admirably
she
stepped
back
into
the
circle
a
fire
maker
with
flushed
face
and
downcast
eyes
her
new
rank
filling
her
with
a
great
sense
of
responsibility
nyoda
then
awarded
the
special
honors
for
which
the
girls
had
been
trying
all
summer
sahwah
and
nakwisi
won
the
banner
for
keeping
up
the
best
form
on
the
hike
migwan
and
hinpoha
had
made
the
best
nature
count
the
alphas
were
the
best
housekeepers
and
had
planned
their
menus
the
most
economically
gladys
had
learned
the
greatest
number
of
birds
flowers
and
trees
migwan
had
written
the
most
songs
each
girl
thus
honored
felt
prouder
to
wear
the
bit
of
painted
leather
bestowed
upon
her
than
if
it
had
been
a
crown
jewel
after
the
summer
honors
had
all
been
given
out
nyoda
rose
again
and
said
there
was
one
more
honor
to
be
awarded
before
the
council
was
over
and
called
on
sahwah
to
stand
sahwah
rose
wonderingly
sahwah
the
sunfish
said
nyoda
impressively
on
the
thirtieth
day
of
the
thunder
moon
you
rescued
from
drowning
at
considerable
inconvenience
to
yourself
the
maiden
we
now
know
as
geyahi
through
some
mysterious
agency
which
we
will
not
mention
our
good
friends
professor
bentley
and
professor
wheeler
heard
of
your
little
escapade
and
made
it
known
to
a
national
society
which
takes
delight
in
hearing
such
tales
this
society
has
sent
you
a
little
badge
for
a
keepsake
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
bestow
upon
you
this
carnegie
hero
medal
distinguished
bravery
a
which
stammered
sahwah
abandoning
both
ceremonial
etiquette
and
grammar
in
her
amazement
yes
it
true
laughed
nyoda
stand
forth
and
be
decorated
speech
cried
the
girls
when
the
medal
had
been
fastened
on
sahwah
ceremonial
gown
but
instead
of
making
a
speech
sahwah
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
burst
into
tears
and
had
to
be
patted
on
the
back
before
she
was
herself
again
so
the
last
council
meeting
ended
with
a
great
feather
in
the
cap
of
the
winnebagos
and
the
fire
sank
to
embers
and
the
girls
filed
out
softly
to
the
tune
of
their
song
now
our
camp
fire
burning
low
wohelo
wohelo
off
to
slumber
we
must
go
wohelo
wohelo
and
the
next
morning
they
all
stood
on
the
dock
waiting
for
the
to
come
and
carry
them
off
laughing
at
each
funny
appearance
in
city
clothes
and
winking
the
tears
back
whenever
they
thought
of
what
they
were
leaving
behind
gladys
who
had
never
seen
the
other
girls
in
suits
scarcely
knew
them
at
all
the
was
crated
up
and
ready
to
be
taken
along
to
the
city
and
sahwah
bathing
suit
still
wet
was
tied
to
the
outside
of
her
suitcase
for
she
had
stayed
in
the
lake
until
the
very
last
minute
dear
beloved
lake
nyoda
heard
her
whisper
as
she
rose
from
the
depths
for
the
last
time
and
gladys
who
had
been
so
loth
to
come
to
camp
with
the
winnebagos
was
still
more
loth
to
go
and
her
only
consolation
was
that
she
could
be
with
the
girls
during
the
winter
and
by
and
by
the
came
and
they
got
aboard
and
went
sailing
out
through
the
gap
and
left
the
lake
and
mountains
and
islands
and
forest
behind
them
forever
but
the
strangest
part
was
that
they
took
with
them
as
much
as
they
left
behind
