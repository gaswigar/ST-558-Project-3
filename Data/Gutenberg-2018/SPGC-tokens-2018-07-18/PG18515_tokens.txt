preface
on
a
beautiful
day
in
spring
as
i
was
running
as
hard
as
i
could
run
pursued
by
the
new
york
police
and
a
number
of
excited
citizens
my
mind
which
becomes
brilliantly
active
under
physical
exhilaration
began
to
work
busily
i
thought
about
all
sorts
of
things
i
thought
about
hard
times
and
financial
depression
and
about
our
great
president
who
is
in
a
class
all
alone
with
himself
and
soon
to
become
extinct
i
thought
about
art
and
why
there
is
any
when
it
talked
about
i
thought
of
of
metagrammatism
monoliths
manicures
and
monsoons
and
all
the
time
i
was
running
as
fast
as
i
could
run
and
the
faster
i
ran
the
more
things
i
thought
about
until
my
terrific
pace
set
my
brain
whizzing
like
a
wheel
i
felt
no
remorse
at
having
published
these
memoirs
of
my
life
which
was
why
the
police
and
populace
were
pursuing
me
maddened
to
frenzy
by
the
fearless
revelation
of
mighty
scientific
truths
in
this
little
volume
you
are
about
to
attempt
to
read
ars
ostentatur
veritas
abesse
videtur
i
thought
about
it
clearly
calmly
concisely
as
i
fled
the
maddened
shouts
of
the
prejudiced
populace
did
not
disturb
me
around
and
around
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
i
ran
the
inmates
of
that
institution
came
out
to
watch
me
and
they
knew
at
a
glance
that
i
was
one
of
them
for
they
set
up
a
clamor
like
a
bunch
of
decoy
ducks
when
one
of
their
wild
comrades
comes
whirling
by
police
police
they
shouted
but
i
went
careering
on
uptown
afraid
only
that
the
park
squirrels
might
club
together
to
corner
me
there
are
corners
in
grain
why
not
in
but
let
that
pass
i
took
the
park
wall
in
front
of
the
great
carnegie
cottage
at
a
single
bound
he
stood
on
his
terrace
and
shouted
police
he
was
quite
logical
the
equal
franchise
society
was
having
a
may
party
in
the
park
near
the
harlem
mere
they
had
chosen
the
honorable
william
jennings
bryan
as
queen
of
the
may
he
wore
low
and
white
socks
he
was
walking
under
a
canopy
crowned
with
paper
flowers
his
hair
curled
over
his
coat
collar
the
tips
of
his
fingers
were
suavely
joined
over
his
abdomen
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
shouted
police
he
was
right
the
cabinet
lacked
only
me
and
i
might
have
consented
to
tarry
might
have
allowed
myself
to
be
apprehended
for
political
purposes
had
not
a
nobler
holier
more
imperative
duty
urged
me
northward
still
though
all
bloomingdale
shouted
stop
him
and
all
matteawan
yelled
police
i
should
not
have
consented
to
pause
even
the
quackitudinous
recognition
spontaneously
offered
by
the
metropolitan
museum
had
not
been
sufficient
to
decoy
me
to
my
fellows
i
knew
of
course
that
i
could
find
a
sanctuary
and
a
welcome
in
many
places
in
almost
any
sectarian
edifice
any
club
any
newspaper
office
any
of
the
great
publishers
any
school
any
museum
i
knew
that
i
would
be
welcomed
at
columbia
university
at
the
annex
to
the
hall
of
fame
in
the
bishop
palace
on
morningside
heights
there
were
many
places
all
ready
to
receive
understand
and
honour
me
for
a
sufficiently
crippled
intellect
for
a
brain
for
the
intellectually
aborted
there
is
always
a
place
on
some
editorial
sectarian
or
educational
staff
try
it
but
i
had
other
ideas
as
i
galloped
northward
the
voiceless
summons
of
the
most
jealous
of
mistresses
was
making
siren
music
in
my
ears
that
coquettish
jade
science
was
calling
me
by
wireless
and
i
was
responding
with
both
legs
and
so
at
last
i
arrived
at
the
bronx
park
and
dashed
into
the
administration
building
where
everybody
rose
and
cheered
me
to
the
echo
i
was
at
home
at
last
unterrified
undismayed
and
ready
again
as
always
to
dedicate
my
life
to
the
service
of
truth
and
to
every
caprice
and
whim
of
my
immortal
mistress
science
but
i
do
want
to

the
third
eye
although
the
man
back
was
turned
toward
me
i
was
uncomfortably
conscious
that
he
was
watching
me
how
he
could
possibly
be
watching
me
while
i
stood
directly
behind
him
i
did
not
ask
myself
yet
nevertheless
instinct
warned
me
that
i
was
being
inspected
that
somehow
or
other
the
man
was
staring
at
me
as
steadily
as
though
he
and
i
had
been
face
to
face
and
his
faded
eyes
were
focussed
upon
me
it
was
an
odd
sensation
which
persisted
in
spite
of
logic
and
of
which
i
could
not
rid
myself
yet
the
little
waitress
did
not
seem
to
share
it
perhaps
she
was
not
under
his
glassy
inspection
but
then
of
course
i
could
not
be
either
no
doubt
the
nervous
tension
incident
to
the
expedition
was
making
me
supersensitive
and
even
morbid
our
rode
the
shallow
waters
at
anchor
rocking
gently
just
off
the
snowy
coral
reef
on
which
we
were
now
camping
the
youthful
waitress
who
for
economy
sake
wore
her
cap
apron
collar
and
cuffs
over
her
dainty
print
dress
was
seated
by
the
signal
fire
writing
in
her
diary
sometimes
she
thoughtfully
touched
her
pencil
point
with
the
tip
of
her
tongue
sometimes
she
replenished
the
fire
from
a
pile
of
dead
mangrove
branches
heaped
up
on
the
coral
reef
beside
her
whatever
she
did
she
accomplished
gracefully
as
for
the
man
grue
his
back
remained
turned
toward
us
both
and
he
continued
apparently
to
scan
the
horizon
for
the
sail
which
we
all
expected
and
all
the
time
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
unpleasant
idea
that
somehow
or
other
he
was
looking
at
me
watching
attentively
the
expression
of
my
features
and
noting
my
every
movement
the
smoke
of
our
fire
blew
wide
across
leagues
of
shallow
sparkling
water
or
when
the
wind
veered
whirled
back
into
our
faces
across
the
reef
curling
and
eddying
among
the
standing
mangroves
like
fog
drifting
seated
there
near
the
fire
from
time
to
time
i
swept
the
horizon
with
my
marine
glasses
but
there
was
no
sign
of
kemper
no
sail
broke
the
far
sweep
of
sky
and
water
nothing
moved
out
there
save
when
a
wild
duck
took
wing
amid
the
dark
raft
of
its
companions
to
circle
low
above
the
ocean
and
settle
at
random
invisible
again
except
when
at
intervals
its
white
breast
flashed
in
the
sunshine
meanwhile
the
waitress
had
ceased
to
write
in
her
diary
and
now
sat
with
the
closed
book
on
her
knees
and
her
pencil
resting
against
her
lips
gazing
thoughtfuly
at
the
back
of
grue
head
it
was
a
ratty
head
of
straight
black
hair
and
looked
greasy
the
rest
of
him
struck
me
as
equally
unkempt
and
dingy
a
youngish
man
lean
deeply
bitten
by
the
sun
of
the
to
a
mahogany
hue
and
unusually
hairy
i
do
mind
a
brawny
hairy
man
but
the
hair
on
grue
arms
and
chest
was
a
rusty
red
and
like
a
chimpanzee
in
texture
and
sometimes
a
wildly
absurd
idea
possessed
me
that
the
man
needed
it
when
he
went
about
in
the
palm
forests
without
his
clothes
but
he
was
only
a
poor
white
a
cracker
recruited
from
one
of
the
reefs
near
pelican
light
where
he
lived
alone
by
fishing
and
selling
his
fish
to
the
hotels
at
heliatrope
city
the
was
his
he
figured
as
our
official
guide
on
this
expedition
an
expedition
which
already
had
begun
to
worry
me
a
great
deal
for
it
was
perhaps
the
wildest
goose
chase
and
the
most
absurdly
hopeless
enterprise
ever
undertaken
in
the
interest
of
science
by
the
bronx
park
authorities
nothing
is
more
dreaded
by
scientists
than
ridicule
and
it
was
in
spite
of
this
terror
of
ridicule
that
i
summoned
sufficient
courage
to
organize
an
exploring
party
and
start
out
in
search
of
something
so
extraordinary
so
hitherto
unheard
of
that
i
had
not
dared
reveal
to
kemper
by
letter
the
object
of
my
quest
no
i
did
not
care
to
commit
myself
to
writing
just
yet
i
had
merely
sent
kemper
a
letter
to
join
me
on
key
he
telegraphed
me
from
tampa
that
he
would
join
me
at
the
rendezvous
and
i
started
directly
from
bronx
park
for
heliatrope
city
arrived
there
in
three
days
found
the
waitress
all
ready
to
start
with
me
inquired
about
a
guide
and
discovered
the
man
grue
in
his
hut
off
pelican
light
made
my
bargain
with
him
and
set
sail
for
key
the
most
excited
and
the
most
nervous
young
man
who
ever
had
dared
disaster
in
the
sacred
cause
of
science
everything
was
now
at
stake
my
honour
reputation
career
fortune
for
as
chief
of
the
anthropological
field
survey
department
of
the
great
bronx
park
zoölogical
society
i
was
perfectly
aware
that
no
scientific
reputation
can
survive
ridicule
nevertheless
the
die
had
been
cast
the
rubicon
crossed
in
a
containing
one
beachcombing
cracker
one
hotel
waitress
a
pile
of
camping
kit
and
special
utensils
and
myself
how
was
i
going
to
tell
kemper
how
was
i
going
to
confess
to
him
that
i
was
staking
my
reputation
as
an
anthropologist
upon
a
letter
or
two
and
a
personal
interview
with
a
young
girl
a
waitress
at
the
hotel
gardenia
in
heliatrope
city
i
lowered
my
and
glanced
sideways
at
the
waitress
she
was
still
chewing
the
end
of
her
pencil
reflectively
she
was
a
pretty
girl
one
evelyn
grey
and
had
been
a
country
in
massachusetts
until
her
health
broke
florida
was
what
she
required
but
that
healing
climate
was
possible
to
her
only
if
she
could
find
there
a
position
also
she
had
nourished
an
ambition
for
a
postgraduate
education
with
further
aspirations
to
a
government
appointment
in
the
smithsonian
institute
all
very
worthy
no
doubt
in
fact
particularly
commendable
because
the
wages
she
saved
as
waitress
in
a
florida
hotel
during
the
winter
were
her
only
means
of
support
while
studying
for
college
examinations
during
the
summer
in
boston
where
she
lived
yet
although
she
was
an
inmate
of
massachusetts
her
face
and
figure
would
have
ornamented
any
stage
i
never
looked
at
her
but
i
thought
so
and
her
cuffs
and
apron
merely
accentuated
the
delusion
such
ankles
are
seldom
seen
when
the
curtain
rises
after
the
overture
odd
that
frivolous
thoughts
could
flit
through
an
intellect
dedicated
only
to
science
the
man
grue
had
not
stirred
from
his
survey
of
the
atlantic
ocean
he
had
a
somewhat
disturbing
capacity
for
remaining
motionless
like
a
stealthy
and
predatory
bird
which
depends
on
immobility
for
aggressive
and
defensive
existence
the
fluttered
his
cotton
shirt
and
trousers
and
the
tattered
brim
of
his
straw
hat
and
always
i
felt
as
though
he
were
watching
me
out
of
the
back
of
his
ratty
head
through
the
ravelled
straw
brim
that
sagged
over
his
neck
the
pretty
waitress
had
now
chewed
the
end
of
her
pencil
to
a
satisfactory
pulp
and
she
was
writing
again
in
her
diary
very
intently
so
that
my
cautious
touch
on
her
arm
seemed
to
startle
her
meeting
her
inquiring
eyes
i
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
not
sure
why
but
i
do
seem
to
care
very
much
for
that
man
grue
do
you
she
glanced
at
the
water
edge
where
grue
stood
immovable
his
back
still
turned
to
us
i
never
liked
him
she
said
under
her
breath
why
i
asked
cautiously
she
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
did
it
gracefully
i
said
have
you
any
particular
reason
for
disliking
him
he
dirty
he
dirty
yet
every
day
he
goes
into
the
sea
and
swims
about
he
ought
to
be
clean
enough
she
thought
for
a
moment
then
he
seems
somehow
to
be
fundamentally
unclean
i
do
mean
that
he
does
wash
himself
but
there
are
certain
sorts
of
animals
and
birds
and
other
creatures
from
which
one
instinctively
shrinks
not
perhaps
because
they
are
materially
unclean
i
understand
i
said
after
a
silence
i
added
well
there
no
chance
now
of
sending
him
back
even
if
i
were
inclined
to
do
so
he
appears
to
be
familiar
with
these
latitudes
i
do
suppose
we
could
find
a
better
man
for
our
purpose
do
you
no
he
was
a
sponge
fisher
once
i
believe
did
he
tell
you
so
no
but
yesterday
when
you
took
the
boat
and
cruised
to
the
south
i
sat
writing
here
and
keeping
up
the
fire
and
i
saw
grue
climbing
about
among
the
mangroves
over
the
water
in
a
most
uncanny
way
and
two
sat
watching
him
and
they
never
moved
he
did
seem
to
see
them
his
back
was
toward
them
and
then
all
at
once
he
leaped
backward
at
them
where
they
sat
on
a
mangrove
and
he
got
one
of
them
by
the
neck
illustration
climbing
about
among
the
mangroves
above
the
water
what
the
girl
nodded
by
the
neck
she
repeated
and
down
they
went
into
the
water
and
what
do
you
suppose
happened
i
ca
imagine
said
i
with
a
grimace
well
grue
went
under
still
clutching
the
squirming
flapping
bird
and
he
under
stayed
under
the
yes
longer
than
any
sponge
diver
i
ever
heard
of
and
i
was
becoming
frightened
when
the
bloody
bubbles
and
feathers
began
to
come
up
was
he
doing
under
water
he
must
have
been
tearing
the
bird
to
pieces
oh
it
was
quite
unpleasant
i
assure
you
smith
and
when
he
came
up
and
looked
at
me
out
of
those
very
vitreous
eyes
he
resembled
something
horridly
amphibious
and
i
felt
rather
sick
and
dizzy
he
got
to
stop
that
sort
of
thing
i
said
angrily
are
harmless
and
i
wo
have
him
killing
them
in
that
barbarous
fashion
i
warned
him
already
to
let
birds
alone
i
do
know
how
he
catches
them
or
why
he
kills
them
but
he
seems
to
have
a
mania
for
doing
it
i
was
interrupted
by
grue
soft
and
rather
pleasant
voice
from
the
water
edge
announcing
a
sail
on
the
horizon
he
did
not
turn
when
speaking
the
next
moment
i
made
out
the
sail
and
focussed
my
glasses
on
it
it
professor
kemper
i
announced
presently
i
so
glad
remarked
evelyn
grey
i
do
know
why
it
should
have
suddenly
occurred
to
me
apropos
of
nothing
that
billy
kemper
was
unusually
handsome
or
why
i
should
have
turned
and
looked
at
the
pretty
waitress
except
that
she
was
perhaps
worth
gazing
upon
from
a
purely
point
of
view
in
fact
to
a
man
not
entirely
absorbed
in
scientific
research
and
not
passionately
and
irrevocably
wedded
to
his
profession
her
eyes
and
rather
sweet
mouth
might
have
proved
disturbing
as
i
was
thinking
about
this
she
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
it
a
good
thing
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
am
irrevocably
wedded
to
my
profession
and
i
gazed
fixedly
across
the
atlantic
ocean
there
was
scarcely
sufficient
breeze
of
a
steady
character
to
bring
kemper
to
key
but
he
got
out
his
sweeps
when
i
hailed
him
and
came
in
at
a
lively
clip
anchoring
alongside
of
our
boat
and
leaping
ashore
with
that
unnecessary
dash
and
abandon
which
women
find
pleasing
glancing
sideways
at
my
waitress
through
my
spectacles
i
found
her
looking
into
a
small
hand
mirror
and
patting
her
hair
with
one
slim
and
suntanned
hand
when
professor
kemper
landed
on
the
coral
he
shot
a
curious
look
at
grue
and
then
came
striding
across
the
reef
to
me
hello
smithy
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
here
i
am
you
see
now
what
up
just
then
evelyn
grey
got
up
from
her
seat
beside
the
fire
and
kemper
turned
and
gazed
at
her
with
every
symptom
of
unfeigned
approbation
i
introduced
him
evelyn
grey
seemed
a
trifle
indifferent
a
man
does
last
long
with
a
clever
woman
i
smiled
to
myself
polishing
my
spectacles
gleefully
yet
i
had
no
idea
why
i
was
smiling
we
three
people
turned
and
walked
toward
the
comb
of
the
reef
a
solitary
palm
represented
the
island
vegetation
except
of
course
for
the
mangroves
i
asked
miss
grey
to
precede
us
and
wait
for
us
under
the
palm
and
she
went
forward
in
that
way
of
hers
which
to
any
man
might
have
been
a
trifle
disturbing
it
had
no
effect
upon
me
besides
i
was
looking
at
grue
who
had
gone
to
the
fire
and
was
evidently
preparing
to
fry
our
evening
meal
of
fish
and
rice
i
like
to
have
him
cook
but
i
was
going
to
do
it
myself
and
my
pretty
waitress
did
know
how
to
cook
anything
more
complicated
than
beans
we
had
no
beans
kemper
said
to
me
why
on
earth
did
you
bring
a
waitress
not
to
wait
on
table
i
replied
amused
i
explain
her
later
meanwhile
i
merely
want
to
say
that
you
need
not
remain
with
this
expedition
if
you
do
want
to
it
optional
with
you
that
a
funny
thing
to
say
no
not
funny
sad
the
truth
is
that
if
i
fail
i
be
driven
into
obscurity
by
the
ridicule
of
my
brother
scientists
the
world
over
i
had
to
tell
them
at
the
bronx
what
i
was
going
after
every
man
connected
with
the
society
attempted
to
dissuade
me
saying
that
the
whole
thing
was
absurd
and
that
my
reputation
would
suffer
if
i
engaged
in
such
a
ridiculous
quest
so
when
you
hear
what
that
girl
and
i
are
after
out
here
in
the
and
when
you
are
in
possession
of
the
only
evidence
i
have
to
justify
my
credulity
if
you
want
to
go
home
go
because
i
do
wish
to
risk
your
reputation
as
a
scientist
unless
you
choose
to
risk
it
yourself
he
regarded
me
curiously
then
his
eyes
strayed
toward
the
which
evelyn
grey
was
now
approaching
all
right
he
said
briefly
let
hear
what
up
so
we
moved
forward
to
rejoin
the
girl
who
had
already
seated
herself
under
the
tree
she
looked
very
attractive
in
her
neat
cuffs
tiny
cap
and
pink
print
gown
as
we
approached
her
why
does
she
dress
that
way
asked
kemper
uneasily
economy
she
desires
to
use
up
the
habiliments
of
a
service
which
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
her
to
reënter
if
this
expedition
proves
successful
oh
but
smithy
what
was
it
moral
to
bring
a
waitress
perfectly
i
replied
sharply
science
knows
no
sex
i
do
understand
how
a
waitress
can
be
scientific
he
muttered
and
there
seems
to
be
no
question
about
her
possessing
plenty
of
sex
if
that
girl
conclusions
are
warranted
i
interrupted
coldly
she
is
a
most
intelligent
and
clever
person
think
they
are
warranted
if
you
do
you
may
go
home
as
soon
as
you
like
i
glanced
at
him
he
was
smiling
at
her
with
that
strained
politeness
which
alters
the
natural
expression
of
men
in
the
imminence
of
a
conversation
with
a
new
and
pretty
woman
i
often
wonder
what
particular
combination
of
facial
muscles
are
brought
into
play
when
that
politely
receptive
expression
transforms
the
normal
and
masculine
features
into
a
fixed
simper
when
kemper
and
i
had
seated
ourselves
i
calmly
cut
short
the
small
talk
in
which
he
was
already
indulging
and
to
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
my
pretty
waitress
was
beginning
to
respond
i
had
scarcely
thought
it
of
her
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
and
i
invited
her
to
recapitulate
the
circumstances
which
had
resulted
in
our
present
foregathering
here
on
this
strip
of
coral
in
the
atlantic
ocean
she
did
so
very
modestly
and
without
embarrassment
stating
the
case
and
reviewing
the
evidence
so
clearly
and
so
simply
that
i
could
see
how
every
word
she
uttered
was
not
only
amazing
but
also
convincing
kemper
when
she
had
ended
he
asked
a
few
questions
very
seriously
granted
he
said
that
the
pituitary
gland
represents
what
we
assume
it
represents
how
much
faith
is
to
be
placed
in
the
testimony
of
a
seminole
indian
a
seminole
indian
she
replied
has
seldom
or
never
been
known
to
lie
and
where
a
whole
tribe
testify
alike
the
truth
of
what
they
assert
can
not
be
questioned
how
did
you
make
them
talk
they
are
a
sullen
suspicious
people
haughty
uncommunicative
seldom
even
replying
to
an
ordinary
question
from
a
white
man
they
consider
me
one
of
them
why
he
asked
in
surprise
i
tell
you
why
it
came
about
through
a
mere
accident
i
was
waitress
at
the
hotel
it
happened
to
be
my
afternoon
off
so
i
went
down
to
the
coquina
dock
to
study
i
study
in
my
leisure
moments
because
i
wish
to
fit
myself
for
a
college
examination
her
charming
face
became
serious
she
picked
up
the
hem
of
her
apron
and
continued
to
pleat
it
slowly
and
with
precision
as
she
talked
there
was
a
seminole
named
sitting
there
his
feet
dangling
above
his
moored
canoe
evidently
waiting
for
the
tide
to
turn
before
he
went
out
to
spear
crayfish
i
merely
noticed
he
was
sitting
there
in
the
sunshine
that
all
and
then
i
opened
my
mythology
book
and
turned
to
the
story
of
argus
on
which
i
was
reading
up
and
this
is
what
happened
there
was
a
picture
of
the
death
of
argus
facing
the
printed
page
which
i
was
reading
the
picture
where
juno
is
holding
the
head
of
the
decapitated
monster
and
i
had
read
scarcely
a
dozen
words
in
the
book
before
the
seminole
beside
me
leaned
over
and
placed
his
forefinger
squarely
upon
the
head
of
argus
he
demanded
i
looked
around
and
was
surprised
at
the
evident
excitement
of
the
indian
they
not
excitable
you
know
said
i
a
greek
gentleman
named
argus
i
suppose
he
thought
i
meant
a
minorcan
for
he
nodded
then
without
further
comment
he
placed
his
finger
on
juno
he
inquired
emphatically
i
said
flippantly
that
only
my
aunt
juno
of
you
kill
argus
had
been
depicted
with
three
eyes
i
said
aunt
juno
had
argus
killed
kill
aunty
needed
his
eyes
to
set
in
the
tails
of
the
peacocks
which
drew
her
automobile
so
when
they
cut
off
the
head
of
argus
my
aunt
had
the
eyes
taken
out
and
that
a
picture
of
how
she
set
them
into
the
peacock
of
he
repeated
i
said
gravely
am
a
direct
descendant
of
the
goddess
of
wisdom
that
why
i
always
studying
when
you
see
me
down
on
the
dock
here
seminole
he
said
emphatically
i
repeated
puzzled
seminole
aunty
seminole
seminole
hunt
long
time
hundred
hundred
year
hunt
kill
say
that
for
hundreds
of
years
the
seminoles
have
hunted
a
creature
with
three
eyes
hunt
now
if
the
legends
of
your
people
tell
you
that
the
seminoles
hunted
a
creature
with
three
eyes
hundreds
of
years
ago
certainly
no
such
creatures
remain
today
where
bayou
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
living
creature
with
three
eyes
still
inhabits
the
forests
of
black
bayou
me
see
me
kill
man
have
killed
a
man
who
had
man
three
eyes
the
pretty
waitress
excitedly
engrossed
in
her
story
was
unconsciously
acting
out
the
thrilling
scene
of
her
dialogue
with
the
indian
even
imitating
his
voice
and
gestures
and
kemper
and
i
listened
and
watched
her
breathlessly
fascinated
by
her
lithe
and
supple
grace
as
well
as
by
the
astounding
story
she
was
so
frankly
unfolding
with
the
consummate
artlessness
of
a
natural
actress
she
turned
her
flushed
face
to
us
i
made
up
my
mind
she
said
that
story
was
worth
investigating
it
was
perfectly
easy
for
me
to
secure
corroboration
because
that
seminole
went
back
to
his
everglade
camp
and
told
every
one
of
his
people
that
i
was
a
white
seminole
because
my
ancestors
also
hunted
the
man
and
nobody
except
a
seminole
could
know
that
such
a
thing
as
a
man
existed
so
the
next
afternoon
off
i
embarked
in
canoe
and
he
took
me
to
his
camp
and
there
i
talked
to
his
people
men
and
women
questioning
listening
putting
this
and
that
together
trying
to
discover
some
foundation
for
their
persistent
statements
concerning
men
still
living
in
the
jungles
of
black
bayou
who
had
three
eyes
instead
of
two
all
told
the
same
story
all
asserted
that
since
the
time
their
records
ran
the
seminoles
had
hunted
and
slain
every
man
they
could
catch
and
that
as
long
as
the
seminoles
had
lived
in
the
everglades
the
men
had
lived
in
the
forests
beyond
black
bayou
she
paused
dramatically
cooling
her
cheeks
in
her
palms
and
looking
from
kemper
to
me
with
eyes
made
starry
by
excitement
and
do
you
think
she
continued
under
her
breath
to
prove
what
they
said
they
brought
for
my
inspection
a
skull
and
then
two
more
skulls
like
the
first
one
every
skull
had
been
painted
with
spanish
red
the
coarse
black
hair
still
stuck
to
the
scalps
and
behind
just
over
where
the
pituitary
gland
is
situated
was
a
hollow
bony
orbit
unmistakably
the
socket
of
a
are
those
skulls
demanded
kemper
in
a
voice
not
entirely
under
control
they
would
part
with
one
of
them
i
tried
every
possible
persuasion
on
my
own
responsibility
and
even
before
i
communicated
with
smith
turning
toward
me
i
offered
them
twenty
thousand
dollars
for
a
single
skull
staking
my
word
of
honour
that
the
bronx
museum
would
pay
that
sum
it
was
useless
not
only
do
the
seminoles
refuse
to
part
with
one
of
those
skulls
but
i
have
also
learned
that
i
am
the
first
person
with
a
white
skin
who
has
ever
even
heard
of
their
existence
so
profoundly
have
these
red
men
of
the
everglades
guarded
their
secret
through
centuries
after
a
silence
kemper
rather
pale
remarked
this
is
a
most
astonishing
business
miss
grey
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
demanded
is
it
not
worth
while
for
us
to
explore
black
bayou
he
nodded
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
but
his
gaze
remained
riveted
on
the
girl
presently
he
said
why
does
miss
grey
go
she
turned
in
surprise
why
am
i
going
but
it
is
discovery
contribution
to
science
is
it
certainly
we
exclaimed
warmly
and
in
unison
and
kemper
added
i
was
only
thinking
of
the
dangers
and
hardships
smith
and
i
could
do
the
actual
work
oh
she
cried
in
quick
protest
i
would
miss
one
moment
of
the
excitement
one
pain
one
pang
i
it
it
would
simply
break
my
heart
not
to
share
every
chance
hazard
danger
of
this
expedition
every
atom
of
hope
excitement
despair
uncertainty
and
the
ultimate
success
the
unsurpassable
thrill
of
exultation
in
the
final
instant
of
triumph
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
a
flash
of
uncontrollable
enthusiasm
and
stood
there
aglow
with
courage
and
resolution
making
a
highly
agreeable
picture
in
her
apron
and
cuffs
the
sea
wind
fluttering
the
bright
tendrils
of
her
hair
under
her
dainty
cap
we
got
to
our
feet
much
impressed
and
now
absolutely
convinced
that
there
did
exist
somewhere
descendants
of
prehistoric
men
in
whom
the
third
eye
placed
in
the
back
of
the
head
for
purposes
of
defensive
observation
had
not
become
obsolete
and
reduced
to
the
traces
which
we
know
only
as
the
pituitary
body
or
pituitary
gland
kemper
and
i
were
of
course
aware
that
in
the
insect
world
the
ocelli
served
the
same
purpose
that
the
degenerate
pituitary
body
once
served
in
the
occiput
of
man
as
we
three
walked
slowly
back
to
the
campfire
where
our
evening
meal
was
now
ready
evelyn
grey
who
walked
between
us
told
us
what
she
knew
about
the
hunting
of
these
men
by
the
seminoles
how
intense
was
the
hatred
of
the
indians
for
these
people
how
murderously
they
behaved
toward
any
one
of
them
whom
they
could
track
down
and
catch
told
me
she
went
on
that
in
all
probability
the
strange
race
was
nearing
extinction
but
that
all
had
not
yet
been
exterminated
because
now
and
then
when
hunting
along
black
bayou
traces
of
living
men
were
still
found
by
him
and
his
people
no
later
than
last
week
himself
had
startled
one
of
these
strange
denizens
of
black
bayou
from
a
meal
of
fish
and
had
heard
him
leap
through
the
bushes
and
plunge
into
the
water
it
appears
that
centuries
of
persecution
have
made
these
men
partly
amphibious
that
is
capable
of
filling
their
lungs
with
air
and
remaining
under
water
almost
as
long
as
a
turtle
that
impossible
said
kemper
bluntly
i
thought
so
myself
she
said
with
a
smile
until
told
me
a
little
more
about
them
he
says
that
they
can
breathe
through
the
pores
of
their
skins
that
their
bodies
are
covered
with
a
thick
silky
hair
and
that
when
they
dive
they
carry
down
with
them
enough
air
to
form
a
sort
of
skin
over
them
so
that
under
water
their
bodies
appear
to
be
good
lord
faltered
kemper
that
is
a
little
too
much
yet
said
i
that
is
exactly
what
water
beetles
do
the
globules
of
air
clinging
to
the
appear
to
them
and
they
can
remain
below
indefinitely
breathing
through
spiracles
doubtless
the
skin
pores
of
these
men
have
taken
on
the
character
of
spiracles
you
know
he
said
in
a
curious
flat
voice
which
sounded
like
the
tones
of
a
partly
stupified
man
this
whole
business
is
so
grotesque
apparently
so
wildly
absurd
that
it
having
a
sort
of
nightmare
effect
on
me
and
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
close
to
my
ear
good
heavens
he
said
can
you
reconcile
such
a
creature
as
we
are
starting
out
to
hunt
with
anything
living
known
to
science
no
i
replied
in
guarded
tones
and
there
are
moments
kemper
since
i
have
come
into
possession
of
miss
grey
story
when
i
find
myself
seriously
doubting
my
own
sanity
i
doubting
mine
now
he
whispered
only
that
girl
is
so
fresh
and
wholesome
and
human
and
sane
she
is
a
very
clever
girl
i
said
and
really
beautiful
she
is
intelligent
i
remarked
there
was
a
chill
in
my
tone
which
doubtless
discouraged
kemper
for
he
ventured
nothing
further
concerning
her
superficially
personal
attractions
after
all
if
any
questions
of
priority
were
to
arise
the
pretty
waitress
was
discovery
and
in
the
scientific
world
it
is
an
inflexible
rule
that
he
who
first
discovers
any
particular
specimen
of
any
species
whatever
is
first
entitled
to
describe
and
comment
upon
that
specimen
without
interference
or
unsolicited
advice
from
anybody
maybe
there
was
in
my
eye
something
that
expressed
as
much
for
when
kemper
caught
my
cold
gaze
fixed
upon
him
he
winced
and
looked
away
like
a
reproved
setter
dog
who
knew
better
which
also
for
the
moment
put
an
end
to
the
rather
gay
and
frivolous
line
of
small
talk
which
he
had
again
begun
with
the
pretty
waitress
i
was
exceedingly
surprised
at
professor
william
henry
kemper
as
we
approached
the
campfire
the
loathsome
odour
of
frying
mullet
saluted
my
nostrils
kemper
glancing
at
grue
said
aside
to
me
that
an
fellow
what
is
he
minorcan
oh
just
a
beachcomber
i
do
know
what
he
is
he
strikes
me
as
dirty
though
he
ca
be
so
physically
i
do
like
him
and
i
know
why
and
i
wish
we
engaged
somebody
else
to
guide
us
toward
dawn
something
awoke
me
and
i
sat
up
in
my
blanket
under
the
moon
but
my
leg
had
not
been
pulled
kemper
snored
at
my
side
in
her
little
the
pretty
waitress
probably
was
fast
asleep
i
knew
it
because
the
string
she
had
tied
to
one
of
her
ornamental
ankles
still
lay
across
the
ground
convenient
to
my
hand
in
any
emergency
i
had
only
to
pull
it
to
awake
her
a
similar
string
tied
to
my
ankle
ran
parallel
to
hers
and
disappeared
under
the
flap
of
her
tent
this
was
for
her
to
pull
if
she
liked
she
had
never
yet
pulled
it
nor
i
the
other
nevertheless
i
truly
felt
that
these
humble
strings
were
in
a
subtler
sense
ties
that
bound
us
together
no
wonder
kemper
behaviour
had
slightly
irritated
me
i
looked
up
at
the
silver
moon
i
glanced
at
kemper
unlovely
bulk
swathed
in
a
blanket
i
contemplated
the
with
perhaps
that
slight
trace
of
sentiment
which
a
moon
is
likely
to
inspire
even
in
a
jellyfish
and
suddenly
i
remembered
grue
and
looked
for
him
he
was
accustomed
to
sleep
in
his
boat
but
i
did
not
see
him
in
either
of
the
boats
here
and
there
were
a
few
lumpy
shadows
in
the
moonlight
but
none
of
them
was
grue
lying
prone
on
the
ground
where
the
devil
had
he
gone
cautiously
i
untied
my
ankle
string
rose
in
my
pajamas
stepped
into
my
slippers
and
walked
out
through
the
moonlight
there
was
nothing
to
hide
grue
no
rocks
or
vegetation
except
the
solitary
palm
on
the
of
the
reef
i
walked
as
far
as
the
tree
and
looked
up
into
the
arching
fronds
nobody
was
up
there
i
could
see
the
moonlit
sky
through
the
fronds
nor
was
grue
lying
asleep
anywhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
coral
ridge
and
suddenly
i
became
aware
of
all
my
latent
distrust
and
dislike
for
the
man
and
the
vigour
of
my
sentiments
surprised
me
because
i
really
had
not
understood
how
deep
and
thorough
my
dislike
had
been
also
his
utter
disappearance
struck
me
as
uncanny
both
boats
were
there
and
there
were
many
leagues
of
sea
to
the
nearest
coast
troubled
and
puzzled
i
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
dead
embers
of
the
fire
kemper
had
merely
changed
the
timbre
of
his
snore
to
a
whistling
aria
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
enraged
me
now
somehow
it
almost
comforted
me
seated
on
the
shore
i
looked
out
to
sea
racking
my
brains
for
an
explanation
of
grue
disappearance
and
while
i
sat
there
racking
them
far
out
on
the
water
a
little
flock
of
ducks
suddenly
scattered
and
rose
with
frightened
quackings
and
furiously
beating
wings
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
saw
a
round
dark
object
on
the
waves
where
the
flock
had
been
and
while
i
sat
there
watching
up
out
of
the
sea
along
the
reef
to
my
right
crawled
a
naked
dripping
figure
holding
a
dead
duck
in
his
mouth
fascinated
i
watched
it
recognising
grue
with
his
ratty
black
hair
all
plastered
over
his
face
whether
he
caught
sight
of
me
or
not
i
do
know
but
he
suddenly
dropped
the
dead
duck
from
his
mouth
turned
and
dived
under
water
it
was
a
grim
and
horrid
species
of
sport
or
pastime
this
amphibious
business
of
his
catching
wild
birds
and
dragging
them
about
as
though
he
were
an
animal
evidently
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
he
had
dropped
the
duck
i
watched
it
floating
by
on
the
waves
its
head
under
water
suddenly
something
jerked
it
under
a
fish
perhaps
for
it
did
not
come
up
and
float
again
as
far
as
i
could
see
when
i
went
back
to
camp
grue
lay
apparently
asleep
on
the
north
side
of
the
fire
i
glanced
at
him
in
disgust
and
crawled
into
my
tent
the
next
day
evelyn
grey
awoke
with
a
headache
and
kept
her
tent
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
prevent
kemper
from
prescribing
for
her
i
did
that
myself
sitting
beside
her
and
testing
her
pulse
for
hours
at
a
time
while
kemper
took
one
of
grue
grains
and
went
off
into
the
mangroves
and
speared
grunt
and
eels
for
a
chowder
which
he
said
he
knew
how
to
concoct
toward
afternoon
the
pretty
waitress
felt
much
better
and
i
warned
kemper
and
grue
that
we
should
sail
for
black
bayou
after
dinner
dinner
was
a
mess
as
usual
consisting
of
fried
mullet
and
rice
and
a
sort
of
chowder
in
which
the
only
ingredients
i
recognised
were
sections
of
crayfish
after
we
had
finished
and
had
withdrawn
from
the
fire
grue
scraped
every
remaining
shred
of
food
into
a
kettle
and
went
for
it
to
see
him
feed
made
me
sick
so
i
rejoined
miss
grey
and
kemper
who
had
found
a
green
cocoanut
and
were
alternately
deriving
nourishment
from
the
milk
inside
it
illustration
to
see
him
feed
made
me
sick
somehow
or
other
there
seemed
to
me
a
certain
levity
about
that
performance
and
it
made
me
uncomfortable
but
i
managed
to
smile
a
rather
sickly
smile
when
they
offered
me
a
draught
and
i
took
a
pull
at
the
milk
i
do
exactly
know
why
because
i
do
like
it
but
the
moon
was
up
over
the
sea
now
and
the
dusk
was
languorously
balmy
and
i
did
care
to
leave
those
two
drinking
milk
out
of
the
same
cocoanut
under
a
tropic
moon
not
that
my
interest
in
evelyn
grey
was
other
than
scientific
but
after
all
it
was
i
who
had
discovered
her
we
sailed
as
soon
as
grue
gobbling
and
snuffling
had
cleaned
up
the
last
crumb
of
food
kemper
blandly
offered
to
take
miss
grey
into
his
boat
saying
that
he
feared
my
boat
was
overcrowded
what
with
the
paraphernalia
the
folding
cages
grue
miss
grey
and
myself
i
sat
on
that
suggestion
but
offered
to
take
my
own
tiller
and
lend
him
grue
he
could
wriggle
out
of
it
seeing
that
his
alleged
motive
had
been
the
overcrowding
of
my
boat
but
he
looked
rather
sick
when
grue
went
aboard
his
boat
as
for
me
i
hoisted
sail
with
something
so
near
a
chuckle
that
it
surprised
me
and
i
looked
at
evelyn
grey
to
see
whether
she
had
noticed
the
unseemly
symptom
apparently
she
had
not
she
sat
forward
her
eyes
fixed
soulfully
upon
the
moon
had
i
been
dedicated
to
any
profession
except
a
scientific
one
but
let
that
pass
grue
in
kemper
led
and
my
boat
followed
out
into
the
silvery
and
purple
dusk
now
all
sparkling
under
the
high
lustre
of
the
moon
dimly
i
saw
vast
rafts
of
wild
duck
part
and
swim
leisurely
away
to
port
and
starboard
leaving
a
glittering
lane
of
water
for
us
to
sail
through
into
the
scintillant
night
from
the
sea
sprang
mullet
silvery
quivering
falling
back
into
the
wash
with
a
splash
here
and
there
in
the
moonlight
steered
ominous
black
triangles
circling
us
leading
us
sheering
across
bow
and
flashing
wake
all
phosphorescent
with
lambent
the
fins
of
great
sharks
you
need
have
no
fear
said
i
to
the
pretty
waitress
she
said
nothing
of
course
if
you
afraid
i
added
perhaps
you
might
care
to
change
your
seat
there
was
room
in
the
stern
where
i
sat
do
you
think
there
is
any
danger
she
asked
from
sharks
yes
reaching
up
and
biting
you
yes
oh
i
do
really
suppose
there
is
i
said
managing
to
convey
the
idea
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
the
catastrophe
was
a
possibility
she
came
over
and
seated
herself
beside
me
i
was
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
could
not
repress
a
triumphant
glance
ahead
at
the
other
boat
where
kemper
sat
huddled
forward
evidently
bored
to
extinction
every
now
and
then
i
could
see
him
turn
and
crane
his
neck
as
though
in
an
effort
to
distinguish
what
was
going
on
in
our
boat
there
was
nothing
going
on
absolutely
nothing
the
moon
was
magnificent
and
i
think
the
pretty
waitress
must
have
been
a
little
tired
for
her
head
drooped
and
nodded
at
moments
even
while
i
was
talking
to
her
about
a
specimen
of
on
which
i
had
written
a
monograph
so
she
must
have
been
really
tired
for
the
subject
was
interesting
you
wo
incommode
my
operations
with
sheet
and
tiller
i
said
to
her
kindly
if
you
care
to
rest
your
head
against
my
shoulder
evidently
she
was
very
tired
for
she
did
so
and
closed
her
eyes
after
a
while
fearing
that
she
might
fall
over
backward
into
the
sea
but
let
that
pass
i
do
know
whether
or
not
kemper
could
distinguish
anything
aboard
our
boat
he
craned
his
head
enough
to
twist
it
off
his
neck
to
be
so
utterly
so
blindly
devoted
to
science
is
a
great
safeguard
for
a
man
however
need
not
induce
atrophy
of
every
humane
impulse
i
drew
the
pretty
waitress
closer
not
that
the
night
was
cold
but
it
might
become
so
changes
in
the
tropics
come
swiftly
it
is
well
to
be
prepared
her
cheek
felt
very
soft
against
my
shoulder
there
seemed
to
be
a
faint
perfume
about
her
hair
it
really
was
odd
how
subtly
fragrant
she
seemed
to
be
almost
perhaps
a
matter
of
scientific
interest
her
hands
did
not
seem
to
be
chilled
they
did
seem
unusually
smooth
and
soft
i
said
to
her
when
at
home
i
suppose
your
mother
tucks
you
in
she
yes
she
nodded
sleepily
and
what
does
she
do
then
said
i
with
something
of
that
ponderous
playfulness
with
which
i
make
scientific
jokes
at
a
meeting
of
the
bronx
anthropological
association
when
i
preside
she
kisses
me
and
turns
out
the
light
said
evelyn
grey
innocently
i
do
know
how
much
kemper
could
distinguish
he
kept
dodging
about
and
twisting
his
head
until
i
really
thought
it
would
come
off
unless
it
had
been
screwed
on
like
the
top
of
a
piano
stool
a
few
minutes
later
he
fired
his
pistol
twice
and
evelyn
sat
up
i
never
knew
why
he
fired
he
never
offered
any
explanation
toward
midnight
i
could
hear
the
roar
of
breakers
on
our
starboard
bow
evelyn
heard
them
too
and
sat
up
inquiringly
grue
has
found
the
inlet
to
black
bayou
i
suppose
said
i
and
it
proved
to
be
the
case
for
with
the
surf
thundering
on
either
hand
we
sailed
into
a
smoothly
flowing
inlet
through
which
the
flood
tide
was
running
between
high
dunes
all
sparkling
in
the
moonlight
and
crowned
with
shadowy
palms
occasionally
i
heard
noises
ahead
of
us
from
the
other
boat
as
though
kemper
was
trying
to
converse
with
us
but
as
his
apropos
was
as
unintelligible
as
it
was
inopportune
i
pretended
not
to
hear
him
besides
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
manoeuvre
the
tiller
and
prevent
evelyn
grey
from
falling
off
backward
into
the
bayou
besides
it
is
not
customary
to
converse
with
the
man
at
the
helm
after
a
while
during
which
i
seemed
to
distinguish
in
kemper
voice
a
quality
that
rhymes
with
his
name
his
tones
varied
through
phases
all
the
way
from
irony
to
exasperation
after
a
while
he
gave
it
up
and
took
to
singing
there
was
a
moon
and
i
suppose
he
thought
he
had
a
voice
it
strike
me
so
after
several
somewhat
melancholy
songs
he
let
off
his
pistol
two
or
three
times
and
then
subsided
into
silence
i
did
care
neither
his
songs
nor
his
shots
interrupted
but
let
that
pass
also
we
were
now
sailing
into
the
forest
through
pool
after
pool
of
interminable
lagoons
startling
into
unseen
and
clattering
flight
hundreds
of
waterfowl
i
could
feel
the
wind
from
their
whistling
wings
in
the
darkness
as
they
drove
by
us
out
to
sea
it
seemed
to
startle
the
pretty
waitress
it
is
a
solemn
thing
to
be
responsible
for
a
pretty
girl
peace
of
mind
i
reassured
her
continually
perhaps
a
trifle
nervously
but
there
were
no
more
pistol
shots
perhaps
kemper
had
used
up
his
cartridges
we
were
still
drifting
along
under
drooping
sails
borne
inland
almost
entirely
by
the
tide
when
the
first
pale
watery
gray
light
streaked
the
east
when
it
grew
a
little
lighter
evelyn
sat
up
all
danger
of
sharks
being
over
also
i
could
begin
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
other
boat
which
was
nothing
remarkable
kemper
slumped
against
the
mast
his
head
turned
in
our
direction
grue
sat
at
the
helm
motionless
his
tattered
straw
hat
sagging
on
his
neck
when
the
sun
rose
i
called
out
cheerily
to
kemper
asking
him
how
he
had
passed
the
night
evelyn
also
raised
her
head
pausing
while
bringing
her
disordered
hair
under
discipline
to
listen
to
his
reply
but
he
merely
mumbled
something
perhaps
he
was
still
sleepy
as
for
me
i
felt
exceedingly
well
and
when
grue
turned
his
craft
in
shore
i
did
so
too
and
when
under
the
overhanging
foliage
of
the
forest
the
nose
of
my
boat
grated
on
the
sand
i
rose
and
crossed
the
deck
with
a
step
distinctly
frolicsome
kemper
seemed
distant
and
glum
evelyn
grey
spoke
to
him
shyly
now
and
then
and
i
noticed
she
looked
at
him
only
when
he
was
gazing
elsewhere
than
at
her
she
had
a
funny
conciliatory
air
with
him
half
ashamed
partly
humorous
and
amused
as
though
something
about
kemper
sulky
was
continually
making
tiny
inroads
on
her
gravity
some
mullet
had
jumped
into
the
two
boats
half
a
dozen
during
our
moonlight
voyage
and
these
were
now
being
fried
with
rice
for
us
by
grue
lord
how
i
hated
to
eat
them
after
we
had
finished
breakfast
grue
as
usual
did
everything
to
the
remainder
except
to
get
into
the
with
both
feet
and
as
usual
he
sickened
me
when
he
cleaned
up
everything
i
sent
him
off
into
the
forest
to
find
a
dry
for
camping
purposes
then
i
made
fast
both
boats
and
kemper
and
i
carried
ashore
our
paraphernalia
spare
firearms
fishing
tackle
spears
harpoons
grains
oars
sails
spars
folding
cage
everything
with
which
a
strictly
scientific
expedition
is
usually
burdened
evelyn
was
washing
her
face
in
the
crystal
waters
of
a
branch
that
flowed
into
the
lagoon
from
under
the
she
looked
very
pretty
doing
it
like
a
naiad
or
dryad
scrubbing
away
at
her
forest
toilet
it
was
in
fact
such
a
pretty
spectacle
that
i
was
going
over
to
sit
beside
her
while
she
did
it
but
kemper
started
just
when
i
was
going
to
and
i
turned
away
some
men
invariably
do
the
wrong
thing
but
a
handsome
man
does
last
long
with
a
pretty
girl
i
was
thinking
of
this
as
i
stood
contemplating
an
alligator
slide
when
grue
came
back
saying
that
the
shore
on
which
we
had
landed
was
the
termination
of
a
and
that
it
was
the
only
dry
place
he
had
found
so
i
bade
him
pitch
our
tents
a
few
feet
back
from
the
shore
and
stood
watching
him
while
he
did
so
one
eye
reverting
occasionally
to
evelyn
grey
and
kemper
they
both
were
seated
beside
the
branch
and
they
seemed
to
be
talking
a
great
deal
and
rather
earnestly
i
could
quite
understand
what
they
found
to
talk
about
so
earnestly
and
volubly
all
of
a
sudden
inasmuch
as
they
had
heretofore
exchanged
very
few
observations
during
a
most
brief
and
formal
acquaintance
dating
only
from
sundown
the
day
before
grue
set
up
our
three
tents
carried
the
luggage
inland
and
then
hung
about
for
a
while
until
the
vast
shadow
of
a
vulture
swept
across
the
trees
i
never
saw
such
an
indescribable
expression
on
a
human
face
as
i
saw
on
grue
as
he
looked
up
at
the
huge
unclean
bird
his
vitreous
eyes
fairly
glittered
the
corners
of
his
mouth
quivered
and
grew
wet
and
to
my
astonishment
he
seemed
to
emit
a
low
mewing
noise
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
i
said
impulsively
in
my
amazement
and
disgust
he
looked
at
me
his
eyes
still
glittering
the
corners
of
his
mouth
still
wet
but
the
curious
sounds
had
ceased
what
he
asked
nothing
i
thought
you
spoke
i
did
know
what
else
to
say
he
made
no
reply
once
when
i
had
partly
turned
my
head
i
was
aware
that
he
was
warily
turning
his
to
look
at
the
vulture
which
had
alighted
heavily
on
the
ground
near
the
entrails
and
heads
of
the
mullet
where
he
had
cast
them
on
the
dead
leaves
i
walked
over
to
where
evelyn
grey
and
kemper
sat
so
busily
conversing
and
their
volubility
ceased
as
they
glanced
up
and
saw
me
approaching
which
phenomenon
both
perplexed
and
displeased
me
i
said
this
is
the
black
bayou
forest
and
we
have
the
most
serious
business
of
our
lives
before
us
suppose
you
and
i
start
out
kemper
and
see
if
there
are
any
traces
of
what
we
are
after
in
the
neighborhood
of
our
camp
do
you
think
it
safe
to
leave
miss
grey
alone
in
camp
he
asked
gravely
i
had
thought
of
that
no
of
course
not
i
said
grue
can
stay
i
do
need
anybody
she
said
quickly
anyway
i
rather
afraid
of
grue
afraid
of
grue
i
repeated
not
exactly
afraid
but
he
unpleasant
i
remain
with
miss
grey
said
kemper
politely
oh
she
exclaimed
i
could
ask
that
it
is
true
that
i
feel
a
little
tired
and
nervous
but
i
can
go
with
you
and
smith
and
grue
i
surveyed
kemper
in
cold
perplexity
as
chief
of
the
expedition
i
could
very
well
offer
to
remain
with
evelyn
grey
but
i
did
propose
that
kemper
should
either
take
grue
he
suggested
and
look
about
the
woods
for
a
while
perhaps
after
dinner
miss
grey
may
feel
sufficiently
rested
to
join
us
i
am
sure
she
said
that
a
few
hours
rest
in
camp
will
set
me
on
my
feet
all
i
need
is
rest
i
did
sleep
very
soundly
last
night
i
felt
myself
growing
red
and
i
looked
away
from
them
both
oh
said
kemper
in
apparent
surprise
i
thought
you
had
slept
soundly
all
night
long
nobody
said
i
could
have
slept
very
pleasantly
during
that
musical
performance
of
yours
were
you
singing
she
asked
innocently
of
kemper
he
was
singing
when
he
was
firing
off
his
pistol
i
remarked
no
wonder
you
could
sleep
with
any
satisfaction
to
yourself
grue
had
disappeared
into
the
forest
i
stood
watching
for
him
to
come
out
again
after
a
few
minutes
i
heard
a
furious
but
distant
noise
of
flapping
the
others
also
heard
it
and
we
listened
in
silence
wondering
what
it
was
it
grue
killing
something
faltered
evelyn
grey
turning
a
trifle
pale
confound
it
i
exclaimed
i
going
to
stop
that
right
now
kemper
rose
and
followed
me
as
i
started
for
the
woods
but
as
we
passed
the
beached
boats
grue
appeared
from
among
the
trees
where
have
you
been
i
demanded
in
the
woods
doing
what
nothing
there
was
a
bit
of
down
here
and
there
clinging
to
his
cotton
shirt
and
trousers
and
one
had
caught
and
stuck
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
see
here
grue
i
said
i
do
want
you
to
kill
any
birds
except
for
camp
purposes
why
do
you
try
to
catch
and
kill
birds
i
do
i
stared
at
the
man
and
he
stared
back
at
me
out
of
his
glassy
eyes
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
somehow
or
other
manage
to
catch
and
kill
birds
no
i
do
there
was
nothing
further
for
me
to
say
unless
i
gave
him
the
lie
i
did
care
to
do
that
needing
his
services
evelyn
grey
had
come
up
to
join
us
there
was
a
brief
silence
we
all
stood
looking
at
grue
and
he
looked
back
at
us
out
of
his
pale
and
unblinking
eyes
grue
i
said
i
have
yet
explained
to
you
the
object
of
this
expedition
to
black
bayou
now
i
tell
you
what
i
want
but
first
let
me
ask
you
a
question
or
two
you
know
the
black
bayou
forests
you
yes
did
you
ever
see
anything
unusual
in
these
forests
no
are
you
sure
the
man
stared
at
us
one
after
another
then
he
said
what
are
you
looking
for
in
black
bayou
something
very
curious
very
strange
very
unusual
so
strange
and
unusual
in
fact
that
the
great
zoölogical
society
of
the
bronx
in
new
york
has
sent
me
down
here
at
the
head
of
this
expedition
to
search
the
forests
of
black
bayou
for
what
he
demanded
in
a
dull
accentless
voice
for
a
totally
new
species
of
human
being
grue
i
wish
to
catch
one
and
take
it
back
to
new
york
in
that
folding
cage
his
green
eyes
had
grown
narrow
as
though
kemper
had
stepped
behind
us
into
the
woods
and
was
now
busy
setting
up
the
folding
cage
grue
remained
motionless
i
am
going
to
offer
you
i
said
the
sum
of
one
thousand
dollars
in
gold
if
you
can
guide
us
to
a
spot
where
we
may
see
this
hitherto
unknown
species
a
creature
which
is
apparently
a
man
but
which
has
in
the
back
of
his
head
a
i
paused
in
amazement
grue
cheeks
had
suddenly
puffed
out
and
were
quivering
and
from
the
corners
of
his
slitted
mouth
he
was
emitting
a
whimpering
sound
like
the
noise
made
by
a
pigeon
grue
i
cried
what
the
matter
with
you
what
is
doing
screamed
grue
quivering
from
head
to
foot
but
not
turning
around
who
i
cried
the
man
behind
me
professor
kemper
he
setting
up
the
folding
cage
with
a
screech
that
raised
my
hair
grue
whipped
out
his
murderous
knife
and
himself
at
kemper
but
the
latter
shrank
aside
behind
the
partly
erected
cage
and
grue
whirled
around
snarling
hacking
and
even
biting
at
the
wood
frame
and
steel
bars
and
then
occurred
a
thing
so
horrid
that
it
sickened
me
to
the
pit
of
my
stomach
for
the
man
sagging
straw
hat
had
fallen
off
and
there
in
the
back
of
his
head
through
the
coarse
black
ratty
hair
i
saw
a
glassy
eye
glaring
at
me
kemper
i
shouted
he
got
a
third
eye
he
one
of
them
knock
him
flat
with
your
riflestock
and
i
seized
a
from
the
top
of
the
baggage
bundle
on
the
ground
beside
me
and
leaped
at
grue
aiming
a
terrific
blow
at
him
illustration
i
shouted
is
one
of
them
knock
him
flat
with
your
riflestock
but
the
glassy
eye
in
the
back
of
his
head
was
watching
me
between
the
clotted
strands
of
hair
and
he
dodged
both
kemper
and
me
swinging
his
heavy
knife
in
circles
and
glaring
at
us
both
out
of
the
front
and
back
of
his
head
kemper
seized
him
by
his
arm
but
grue
shirt
came
off
and
i
saw
his
entire
body
was
as
furry
as
an
ape
and
all
the
while
he
was
snapping
at
us
and
leaping
hither
and
thither
to
avoid
our
blows
and
from
the
corners
of
his
puffed
cheeks
he
whined
and
whimpered
and
mewed
through
the
saliva
foam
keep
him
from
the
water
i
panted
following
him
with
clubbed
and
as
i
advanced
i
almost
stepped
on
a
soiled
heap
of
foulness
the
dead
buzzard
which
he
had
caught
and
worried
to
death
with
his
teeth
suddenly
he
threw
his
knife
at
my
head
hurling
it
backward
dodged
screeched
and
bounded
by
me
toward
the
shore
of
the
lagoon
where
the
pretty
waitress
was
standing
petrified
for
one
moment
i
thought
he
had
her
but
she
picked
up
her
skirts
ran
for
the
nearest
boat
and
seized
a
harpoon
and
in
his
fierce
eagerness
to
catch
her
he
leaped
clear
over
the
boat
and
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
lagoon
as
kemper
and
i
sprang
aboard
and
looked
over
into
the
water
we
could
see
him
going
down
out
of
reach
of
a
harpoon
and
his
body
seemed
to
be
flashing
and
glittering
like
a
burnished
eel
so
completely
did
the
skin
of
air
envelope
him
held
there
by
the
fur
that
covered
him
and
as
he
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
bottom
deep
down
through
the
clear
waters
of
the
lagoon
where
he
lay
prone
i
could
see
as
the
current
stirred
his
long
black
hair
the
third
eye
looking
up
at
us
glassy
unwinking
horrible
a
bubble
or
two
like
globules
of
quicksilver
were
detached
from
the
burnished
skin
of
air
that
clothed
him
and
came
glittering
upward
suddenly
there
was
a
flash
a
flurrying
cloud
of
blue
mud
and
grue
was
gone
after
a
long
while
i
turned
around
in
the
muteness
of
my
despair
and
slowly
froze
for
the
pretty
waitress
becomingly
pale
was
gathered
in
kemper
arms
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
neither
seemed
to
be
aware
of
me
darling
he
said
in
the
imbecile
voice
of
a
man
in
love
why
do
you
tremble
so
when
i
am
here
to
protect
you
do
you
love
and
trust
me
oo
h
yes
she
sighed
pressing
her
cheek
closer
to
his
shoulder
i
shoved
my
hands
into
my
pockets
passed
them
without
noticing
them
and
stepped
ashore
and
there
i
sat
down
under
a
tree
with
my
back
toward
them
all
alone
and
face
to
face
with
the
greatest
grief
of
my
life
but
which
it
was
the
loss
of
her
or
the
loss
of
grue
i
had
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
the
immortal
i
as
everybody
knows
the
great
majority
of
americans
upon
reaching
the
age
of
natural
selection
are
elected
to
the
american
institute
of
arts
and
ethics
which
is
so
to
speak
the
ellis
island
of
the
academy
occasionally
a
general
mobilization
of
the
academy
is
ordered
and
from
the
teeming
population
of
the
institute
a
new
immortal
is
selected
for
the
american
academy
of
moral
endeavor
by
the
simple
process
of
blindfolded
selection
from
the
motto
of
this
most
stately
of
earthly
institutions
is
a
peculiarly
modest
truthful
and
unintentional
epigram
by
tupper
unknown
i
became
famous
famous
i
remain
unknown
and
so
i
found
it
to
be
the
case
for
when
at
last
i
was
privileged
to
write
my
name
smith
academician
i
discovered
to
my
surprise
that
i
knew
none
of
my
brother
immortals
and
more
amazing
still
none
of
them
had
ever
heard
of
me
this
latter
fact
became
the
more
astonishing
to
me
as
i
learned
the
identity
of
the
other
immortals
even
the
president
of
our
great
republic
was
numbered
among
these
olympians
i
had
every
right
to
suppose
that
he
had
heard
of
me
i
had
happened
to
hear
of
him
because
his
secretary
of
state
once
mentioned
him
at
chautauqua
it
was
a
wonderfully
meaningless
sensation
to
know
nobody
and
to
discover
myself
equally
unknown
amid
that
matchless
companionship
we
were
like
a
mixed
bunch
of
gods
greek
norse
hindu
hottentot
all
gathered
on
olympus
having
never
heard
of
each
other
but
taking
it
for
granted
that
we
were
all
gods
together
and
all
members
of
this
club
my
initiation
into
the
academy
had
been
fixed
for
april
first
and
i
was
much
worried
concerning
the
address
which
i
was
of
course
expected
to
deliver
on
that
occasion
before
my
fellow
members
it
had
to
be
an
exciting
address
because
slumber
was
not
an
infrequent
phenomenon
among
the
immortals
on
such
solemn
occasions
like
dozens
of
dozing
joves
a
dull
discourse
always
set
them
nodding
but
always
under
such
circumstances
the
pretty
ushers
from
barnard
college
passed
around
refreshments
a
suffragette
orchestra
struck
up
the
ushers
uprooted
the
seated
immortals
and
them
into
comparative
consciousness
but
i
did
wish
to
have
my
inaugural
address
interrupted
therefore
i
was
at
my
wits
ends
to
discover
a
subject
of
such
exciting
scientific
interest
that
my
august
audience
could
not
choose
but
listen
as
attentively
as
they
would
listen
from
the
front
row
to
some
deathless
stunt
in
vaudeville
that
morning
i
had
left
the
bronx
rather
early
hoping
that
a
long
walk
might
compose
my
thoughts
and
enable
me
to
think
of
some
sufficiently
entertaining
and
unusual
subject
for
my
inaugural
address
i
walked
as
far
as
columbia
university
gazed
with
rapture
upon
its
magnificent
architecture
until
i
was
as
satiated
as
though
i
had
arisen
from
a
banquet
at
childs
to
aid
mental
digestion
i
strolled
over
to
the
noble
home
of
the
academy
and
institute
adjoining
huntington
museum
it
was
a
fine
sunny
morning
and
the
immortals
were
being
exercised
by
a
number
of
pretty
ushers
from
barnard
i
gazed
upon
the
impressive
procession
with
pride
unutterable
very
soon
i
also
should
walk
two
and
two
in
the
sunshine
my
dome
crowned
with
figurative
laurels
cracking
scientific
witticisms
with
my
fellow
inmates
or
perhaps
squeezing
the
pretty
fingers
of
some
but
let
that
pass
i
was
as
i
say
gazing
upon
this
inspiring
scene
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
february
when
i
became
aware
of
a
short
and
visibly
vulgar
person
beside
me
plucking
persistently
at
my
elbow
are
you
the
great
academician
perfessor
smith
he
asked
tipping
his
and
somewhat
soiled
bowler
yes
i
said
condescendingly
your
description
of
me
precludes
further
doubt
what
can
i
do
for
you
my
good
man
are
you
this
here
perfessor
smith
of
the
department
of
anthropology
in
the
bronx
park
zoölogical
society
he
persisted
what
do
you
desire
of
me
i
repeated
taking
another
look
at
him
he
was
exceedingly
ordinary
prof
old
sport
he
said
cordially
i
took
a
slant
at
the
papers
yesterday
an
i
seen
all
about
the
big
time
these
guys
had
when
you
rode
the
goat
rode
when
you
was
elected
get
me
i
stared
at
him
he
grinned
in
a
friendly
way
the
privacy
of
those
solemn
proceedings
should
remain
sacred
it
were
unfit
to
discuss
such
matters
with
the
world
at
large
i
said
coldly
i
get
you
he
rejoined
cheerfully
what
do
you
desire
of
me
i
repeated
why
this
unseemly
apropos
i
was
comin
to
it
perfessor
i
be
frank
i
need
money
you
need
brains
no
he
said
i
got
plenty
of
overstocked
with
idees
what
i
want
to
do
is
to
sell
a
few
do
you
know
you
are
impudent
listen
friend
i
seen
a
piece
in
the
papers
as
how
you
was
to
make
the
speech
of
your
life
when
you
ride
the
goat
for
these
here
guys
on
april
first
i
decline
to
listen
minute
friend
i
want
to
ask
you
one
thing
are
you
going
to
talk
about
i
was
already
moving
away
but
i
stopped
and
stared
at
him
that
the
question
he
nodded
with
unimpaired
cheerfulness
are
you
going
to
talk
about
on
april
first
remember
it
the
party
of
your
life
that
each
an
every
paper
in
the
united
states
will
print
what
you
say
now
how
about
it
friend
are
you
up
in
your
lines
swallowing
my
repulsion
for
him
i
said
why
are
you
concerned
as
to
what
may
be
the
subject
of
my
approaching
address
there
you
are
prof
he
exclaimed
delightedly
i
want
to
do
business
with
you
that
me
i
frank
about
it
say
there
ought
to
be
a
wad
of
the
joyful
in
it
for
us
both
what
sure
we
can
work
it
any
old
way
take
tyng
tyng
and
company
the
typewriter
people
i
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
what
i
can
get
out
them
if
you
mention
the
typewriter
in
your
speech
what
you
suggest
is
infamous
i
said
haughtily
believe
there
enough
in
it
to
make
it
a
financial
coup
and
i
ask
you
prof
is
a
financial
coup
respectable
you
seem
to
be
morally
unfitted
to
comprehend
pardon
i
fitted
up
regardless
with
all
kinds
of
fixtures
fixed
to
undertake
anything
now
if
you
prefer
the
bunsen
baby
biscuit
bunch
why
old
man
bunsen
would
come
across
i
wo
do
such
things
i
said
angrily
very
well
very
well

get
riled

only
one
way
to
build
on
fifth
avenoo
i
got
one
hundred
thousand
other
ways
i

some
of
them

the
money

as
big
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
yes

why

to
make
the
holler
of
your
life
ai
you
what
are
you

to
say
hey
what
you
aimin
to
say
to
make
those
guys
set
up
what
the
use
of
ai
you
willin
to
pay
me
a
few
plunks
if
i
to
you
the
most
startlin
phenomena
that
has
ever
electrified
civilization
sense
the
era
of
barnum
i
was
already
hurrying
away
when
the
mention
of
that
great
name
halted
me
once
more
the
little
flashy
man
had
been
tagging
along
at
my
heels
talking
cheerfully
and
volubly
all
the
while
and
now
as
i
halted
again
he
struck
an
attitude
legs
apart
thumbs
hooked
in
his
and
his
head
cocked
knowingly
on
one
side
prof
he
said
if
you
work
in
the
company
or
fix
it
up
with
bunsen
to
mention
his
baby
biscuits
as
the
most
nootritious
of
condeements
there
be
more
in
it
for
you
an
me
but
it
up
to
you
well
i
wo
i
retorted
very
well
well
he
said
soothingly
then
look
over
another
line
o
samples
no
trouble
to
show
none
at
all
sir
now
if
barnum
was
alive
i
said
very
seriously
the
name
of
that
great
discoverer
falling
from
your
illiterate
lips
has
halted
me
a
second
time
his
name
alone
invests
your
somewhat
suspicious
conversation
with
a
dignity
and
authority
heretofore
conspicuously
absent
if
as
you
hint
you
have
any
scientific
information
for
sale
which
barnum
might
have
considered
worth
purchasing
you
may
possibly
find
in
me
a
client
proceed
young
sir
say
listen
bo
i
mean
prof
i
got
the
goods
do
worry
i
got
information
in
my
that
would
make
your
speech
the
event
of
the
century
the
question
remains
do
i
get
mine
illustration
listen
bo
i
mean
prof
i
got
the
goods
what
is
this
scientific
information
we
had
now
walked
as
far
as
riverside
drive
there
were
plenty
of
unoccupied
benches
i
sat
down
and
he
seated
himself
beside
me
for
a
few
moments
i
gazed
upon
the
magnificent
view
even
he
seemed
awed
by
the
proportions
of
the
superb
iron
gas
tank
dominating
the
prospect
i
gazed
at
the
colossal
advertisements
across
the
hudson
at
the
freight
trains
below
i
gazed
upon
the
lordly
hudson
itself
that
majestic
sewer
which
drains
the
empire
state
bearing
within
its
resistless
flood
millions
of
tons
of
insoluble
matter
from
that
magic
fairyland
which
we
call
to
the
sea
and
thinking
of
disposal
plants
i
thought
of
that
sublime
paraphrase
from
the
mohawk
to
the
hudson
and
from
the
hudson
to
the
sea
bo
he
said
i
got
ta
hand
it
to
you
them
guys
might
have
got
wise
if
you
had
worked
in
the
company
or
the
bunsen
stuff
there
was
big
money
into
it
but
it
might
not
have
went
i
waited
curiously
but
this
here
dope
i
startin
in
to
cook
for
you
is
a
straight
reelible
an
hones
pill
barnum
he
would
have
went
a
million
miles
to
see
what
i
seen
last
janooary
down
in
the
coquina
country
where
is
that
say
that
what
costs
money
to
know
when
i
put
you
wise

due
to
retire
from

me

on

get
me
he
bestowed
upon
me
a
loathsome
wink
well
it
went
big
till
i
made
a
break
and
got
in
dutch
with
the
navy
department
what
was
surveyin
the
everglades
for
a
safe
and
sane
harbor
of
refuge

an
the
sheriff
of
pickalocka
county
racin
me

got
lost
for
fair
yes
sir
he
smiled
reminiscently
produced
from
his
pockets
the
cold
and
offensive
remains
of
a
partly
consumed
cigar
and
examined
it
critically
then
he
requested
a
match
i
shall
now
pass
over
lightly
or
in
subdood
silence
the
painful
events
of
my
flight
he
remarked
waving
his
cigar
and
expelling
a
long
squirt
of
smoke
from
his
unshaven
lips
surfice
it
to
say
that
i
got
that
was
comin
to
me
an
then
some
what
with
snakes
and
murskeeters
an
briers
an
mud
an
hunger
an
thirst
an
heat
was
there
a
wop
named
pizarro
or
somethin
what
got
lost
down
in
florida
well
he
got
nothin
on
me
i
never
want
to
see
the
dam
state
again
but
i
go
back
if
say
so
his
small
rat
eyes
rested
musingly
upon
the
river
he
sucked
thoughtfully
at
his
cigar
hooked
one
soiled
thumb
into
the
armhole
of
his
fancy
vest
and
crossed
his
legs
to
resoom
he
said
cheerily
i
come
out
one
day
half
nood
onto
the
banks
of
the
miami
river
the
rest
was
a
pipe
after
what
i
had
went
through
i
trimmed
a
guy
at
miami
got
clothes
and
railroad
fare
an
ducked
now
the
valyble
portion
of
my
discourse
is
this
here
partial
information
concernin
what
i
seen
or
rather
what
i
run
onto
durin
my
crool
flight
from
my
persecutors
an
these
here
is
the
facts
there
is
contrary
to
maps
coast
survey
guys
an
general
opinion
a
range
of
hills
in
florida
made
entirely
of
coquina
it
a
good
big
range
too
fifty
miles
long
an
anywhere
from
one
to
five
miles
acrost
an
what
i
got
to
say
is
this
into
them
there
coquina
hills
there
still
lives
the
expirin
remains
of
the
what
i
exclaimed
incredulously
or
he
continued
calmly
to
speak
more
the
few
individools
of
that
there
expirin
race
is
now
totally
reduced
to
a
few
women
your
statement
is
wild
no
but
they
wild
i
seen
bein
extremely
i
approached
nearer
but
they
hove
rocks
at
me
they
did
an
they
run
into
the
rocks
like
they
did
an
i
was
too
much
on
the
blink
to
stick
around
whistlin
for
dearie
but
i
seen
they
was
all
dolled
up
in
the
skins
of
wild
annermals
when
i
see
the
first
one
she
was
eatin
onto
a
ear
of
corn
an
i
nearly
ketched
her
but
she
run
like
hellnall
yes
sir
just
like
that
so
next
i
looked
for
some
cave
guy
to
waltz
up
an
paste
me
but
no
after
i
had
went
through
them
dam
coquina
mountains
i
realized
that
there
was
nary
a
guy
left
in
this
here
expirin
race
only
women
only
about
a
dozen
o
them
he
ceased
meditatively
expelled
a
cloud
of
pungent
smoke
and
folded
his
arms
of
course
said
i
with
a
sneer
you
have
proofs
to
back
your
pleasant
tale
sure
i
made
a
map
i
see
said
i
sarcastically
you
propose
to
have
me
pay
you
for
that
map
sure
how
much
my
confiding
friend
ten
thousand
plunks
i
began
to
laugh
he
laughed
too
you
pay
if
you
take
my
map
go
to
the
coquina
hills
he
said
i
stopped
laughing
do
you
mean
that
i
am
to
go
there
and
investigate
before
i
pay
you
for
this
information
sure
if
the
goods
ai
up
to
sample
the
deal
is
off
sample
what
sample
i
demanded
derisively
he
made
a
gesture
with
one
soiled
hand
as
though
quieting
a
balky
horse
i
took
a
snapshot
friend
you
wanta
take
a
slant
at
it
you
took
a
photograph
of
one
of
these
alleged
i
took
ten
but
when
these
here
hove
rocks
at
me
the
fillums
was
put
on
the
blink
all
excep
this
one
which
i
printed
he
drew
from
his
inner
coat
pocket
a
photograph
and
handed
it
to
me
the
most
amazing
photograph
i
ever
gazed
upon
astounded
almost
convinced
i
sat
looking
at
this
irrefutable
evidence
in
silence
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
drifting
into
my
face
aroused
me
from
a
sort
of
dazed
inertia
listen
i
said
half
strangled
are
you
willing
to
wait
for
payment
until
i
personally
have
verified
the
existence
of
these
er
creatures
you
betcher
when
you
have
went
there
an
have
saw
the
goods
just
let
me
have
mine
if
they
up
to
sample
is
that
right
it
seems
perfectly
fair
it
is
fair
i
would
try
to
do
a
scientific
guy
no
sir
me
without
no
eddycation
only
brains
fat
chance
i
have
to
put
one
over
on
a
academy
sport
what
with
latin
an
greek
an
scientific
stuff
an
all
like
that
i
admitted
to
myself
that
he
stand
no
chance
is
it
a
go
he
asked
where
is
the
map
i
inquired
trembling
internally
with
excitement
ha
ha
he
said
listen
to
my
mirth
the
map
is
inside
here
old
sport
and
he
tapped
his
retreating
forehead
with
one
finger
i
see
said
i
trying
to
speak
carelessly
you
desire
to
pilot
me
i
do
desire
to
but
i
got
ta
go
with
you
an
accurate
map
can
it
old
sport
a
accurate
map
is
all
right
when
it
pasted
over
the
front
of
your
head
for
a
face
but
i
wear
the
other
kind
of
map
me
conk
get
me
i
confess
that
i
do
not
well
get
then
it
a
cash
deal
if
the
goods
is
up
to
sample
you
hand
me
mine
then
an
there
i
do
deliver
no
goods
i
shows
to
you
after
you
have
saw
them
it
up
to
you
to
round
up
that
all
as
they
say
when
our
great
president
pulls
a
gun
there
goin
to
be
no
shootin
walk
out
quietly
ladies
after
i
had
sat
there
for
fully
ten
minutes
staring
at
him
i
came
to
the
only
logical
conclusion
possible
to
a
scientific
mind
i
said
you
are
admittedly
unlettered
you
are
confessedly
a
chevalier
of
industry
personally
you
are
exceedingly
distasteful
to
me
but
it
is
useless
to
deny
that
you
are
the
most
extraordinary
man
i
ever
saw
how
soon
can
you
take
me
to
these
coquina
hills
gim
me
hours
to
fix
things
he
said
gaily
is
that
all
it
plenty
i
guess
an
say
what
it
a
cash
deal
get
me
i
shall
have
with
me
a
certified
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
also
a
pair
of
automatics
he
laughed
huh
he
said
i
could
loco
your
soup
if
i
was
kind
i
on
the
level
perfessor
if
i
was
i
could
get
you
in
about
a
hundred
styles
while
you
was
blinkin
at
what
you
was
about
but
i
ai
no
you
had
oughta
pull
that
stuff
on
me
i
give
you
your
chanst
take
it
or
leave
it
i
pondered
profoundly
for
another
ten
minutes
and
at
last
my
decision
was
irrevocably
reached
it
a
bargain
i
said
firmly
what
is
your
name
sam
mink
write
it
samuel
onto
that
there
certyfied
check
if
you
can
spare
the
extra
seconds
from
your
valooble
time
ii
on
monday
the
first
day
of
march
about
we
came
in
sight
of
something
which
until
i
had
met
mink
i
never
had
dreamed
existed
in
southern
florida
a
high
range
of
hills
it
had
been
an
eventless
journey
from
new
york
to
miami
from
miami
to
fort
coquina
but
from
there
through
an
absolutely
pathless
wilderness
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
the
journey
had
been
exasperating
where
we
went
i
do
not
know
even
now
and
water
hammock
and
shell
mound
palm
forests
swamps
wildernesses
of
and
vast
stretches
of
pine
lagoons
sloughs
branches
muddy
creeks
reedy
reaches
from
which
wild
fowl
rose
in
clouds
where
alligators
lurked
or
lumbered
about
after
stranded
fish
horrible
mangrove
thickets
full
of
moccasins
and
heronry
more
horrible
still
out
of
which
the
heat
from
a
vertical
sun
distilled
the
last
atom
of
nauseating
effluvia
all
these
choice
spots
we
visited
under
the
guidance
of
the
wretched
mink
i
seemed
to
be
missing
nothing
that
might
discourage
or
disgust
me
he
appeared
to
know
the
way
somehow
although
my
compass
became
mysteriously
lost
the
first
day
out
from
fort
coquina
again
and
again
i
felt
instinctively
that
we
were
travelling
in
a
vast
circle
but
mink
always
denied
it
and
i
had
no
scientific
instruments
to
verify
my
deepening
suspicions
another
thing
bothered
me
mink
did
not
seem
to
suffer
from
insects
or
heat
in
fact
to
my
intense
annoyance
he
appeared
to
be
having
a
comfortable
time
of
it
eating
and
drinking
with
gusto
sleeping
snugly
under
a
mosquito
bar
permitting
me
to
do
all
camp
work
the
paddling
as
long
as
we
used
a
canoe
and
all
the
cooking
too
claiming
on
his
part
a
complete
ignorance
of
culinary
art
sometimes
he
condescended
to
catch
a
few
fish
for
the
common
pan
sometimes
he
bestirred
himself
to
shoot
a
duck
or
two
but
usually
he
played
on
his
concertina
during
his
leisure
moments
which
were
plentiful
i
began
to
detest
samuel
mink
at
first
i
was
murderously
suspicious
of
him
and
i
walked
about
with
my
automatic
arsenal
ostentatiously
displayed
but
he
looked
like
such
a
miserable
little
shrimp
that
i
became
ashamed
of
my
precautions
besides
as
he
cheerfully
pointed
out
a
little
koonti
soaked
in
my
drinking
water
would
have
done
my
business
for
me
if
he
had
meant
me
any
physical
harm
also
he
had
a
horrid
habit
of
noosing
moccasins
for
sport
and
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
introduce
one
to
me
while
i
slept
really
what
most
worried
me
was
the
feeling
which
i
could
not
throw
off
that
somehow
or
other
we
were
making
very
little
progress
in
any
particular
direction
he
even
admitted
that
there
was
reason
for
my
doubts
but
he
confided
to
me
that
to
find
these
coquina
hills
was
like
traversing
a
maze
doubling
to
and
fro
among
forests
and
swamps
he
insisted
was
the
only
possible
path
of
access
to
the
undiscovered
coquina
hills
of
florida
otherwise
he
argued
these
coquina
hills
would
long
ago
have
been
discovered
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
been
right
when
at
last
we
came
out
on
the
edge
of
a
palm
forest
and
beheld
that
astounding
blue
outline
of
hills
in
a
country
which
has
always
been
supposed
to
lie
as
flat
as
a
flabby
a
desert
of
stretched
away
before
us
to
the
base
of
the
hills
game
trails
ran
through
it
in
every
direction
like
sheep
paths
a
few
florida
deer
trotted
away
as
we
appeared
into
one
of
these
trails
stepped
samuel
mink
burdened
only
with
his
concertina
and
a
box
of
cigars
i
loaded
with
seventy
pounds
of
impedimenta
including
a
apparatus
reeled
after
him
he
walked
on
jauntily
toward
the
hills
his
bowler
hat
at
an
angle
occasionally
he
played
upon
his
concertina
as
he
advanced
now
and
then
he
cut
a
pigeon
wing
i
hated
him
at
every
toilsome
step
i
hated
him
more
deeply
he
played
tipperary
on
his
concertina
see
old
top
he
inquired
nodding
toward
the
hills
i
a
man
of
my
word
i
am
look
at
take
in
old
sport
an
reemember
each
an
every
hill
is
guaranteed
to
contain
one
bony
fidy
what
is
the
last
vanishin
traces
of
a
extinc
an
dissappeerin
race
we
toiled
on
that
is
i
did
bowed
under
my
sweating
load
of
paraphernalia
he
skipped
in
advance
like
some
degenerate
twentieth
century
faun
playing
on
his
pipes
the
unmitigated
melodies
of
george
cohan
watch
your
step
he
cried
nimbly
avoiding
the
attentions
of
a
which
tried
to
caress
his
ankle
from
under
a
with
a
shudder
i
gave
the
deadly
little
reptile
room
and
floundered
forward
a
prey
to
exhaustion
melancholy
and
a
few
buzzards
kept
pace
with
me
their
broad
black
shadows
gliding
ominously
over
the
earth
lizards
went
rustling
and
leaping
away
on
every
side
floppy
butterflies
escorted
me
a
strange
bird
which
seemed
to
be
dressed
in
a
union
suit
of
checked
gingham
flew
from
tree
to
tree
as
i
plodded
on
and
squealed
at
me
persistently
at
last
i
felt
the
hard
coquina
under
foot
the
cool
blue
shadow
of
the
hills
enveloped
me
i
slipped
off
my
pack
dumped
it
beside
a
little
rill
of
crystal
water
which
ran
sparkling
from
the
hills
and
sat
down
on
a
soft
and
fragrant
carpet
of
after
a
while
i
drank
my
fill
at
the
rill
bathed
head
neck
face
and
arms
and
feeling
delightfully
refreshed
leaned
back
against
the
slab
of
coquina
what
are
you
doing
i
demanded
of
mink
who
was
unpacking
the
kit
and
disengaging
the
machine
gettin
ready
he
replied
fussing
busily
with
the
camera
you
do
expect
to
see
any
cave
people
here
do
you
i
asked
with
a
thrill
of
reviving
excitement
why
not
why
the
first
one
i
seen
was
into
this
brook
here
where
i
sitting
i
asked
incredulously
yes
sir
right
there
it
was
this
way
i
was
lyin
down
tryin
to
figure
the
shortes
way
to
fort
coquina
an
wishin
i
was
nearer
broadway
than
i
was
to
the
equator
when
i
heard
a
voice
say
an
then
i
seen
two
come
along
right
there
where
you
are
say
they
was
lookers
an
they
come
along
quiet
like
two
deer
kinder
nosin
the
air
and
listenin
whiz
thinks
i
ai
got
so
much
on
them
dames
an
at
that
one
o
them
wore
a
skin
an
that
all
an
a
ai
big
and
she
sported
pyjamas
so
when
they
do
see
nothin
around
to
hinder
they
just
lays
down
flat
and
takes
a
drink
into
that
pool
lookin
up
every
swallow
like
little
birds
listenin
and
kinder
thankin
god
for
a
good
square
drink
i
knowed
they
was
wild
girls
soon
as
i
seen
also
they
sez
to
one
another
kinder
all
the
same
i
seen
wilder
ladies
on
broadway
so
i
took
a
chanst
where
i
was
squattin
behind
a
rock
so
sez
i
there
sweetie
have
a
taxi
on
me
an
with
that
they
is
on
their
feet
quiverin
all
over
an
nosin
the
wind
so
first
i
took
some
snapshots
at
with
my
bijoo
camera
i
guess
they
scented
me
all
right
for
i
seen
their
eyes
grow
bigger
then
they
give
a
bound
an
was
off
over
the
rocks
an
me
after
say
that
was
some
until
a
few
more
come
out
on
them
rocks
above
us
an
hove
chunks
of
coquina
at
me
an
with
all
that
dodgin
an
duckin
of
them
there
rocks
the
got
away
an
i
seen
an
the
other
scurryin
into
little
caves
one
whisked
into
this
hole
another
scuttled
into
that
bing
all
over
all
i
could
think
of
was
to
light
a
cigar
an
blow
the
smoke
in
after
the
but
i
could
smoke
her
out
an
i
time
to
starve
her
out
so
that
all
i
know
about
this
here
an
extinc
race
o
vanishin
as
his
simple
and
illiterate
narrative
advanced
i
became
proportionally
excited
and
when
he
ended
i
sprang
to
my
feet
in
an
uncontrollable
access
of
scientific
enthusiasm
was
she
really
pretty
i
asked
listen
she
was
that
peachy
enough
i
cried
science
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
are
your
films
ready
to
record
a
scene
without
precedent
in
the
scientific
annals
of
creation
they
sure
is
then
place
your
camera
and
your
person
in
a
strategic
position
this
is
a
magnificent
spot
for
an
ambush
come
over
beside
me
he
came
across
to
where
i
had
taken
cover
among
the
ferns
behind
the
parapet
of
coquina
and
with
a
thrill
of
pardonable
joy
i
watched
him
unlimber
his
photographic
artillery
and
place
it
in
battery
where
my
every
posture
and
action
would
be
recorded
for
posterity
if
a
came
down
to
the
to
drink
it
were
futile
i
explained
to
him
in
a
guarded
voice
for
me
to
attempt
to
cajole
her
as
you
attempted
it
neither
playful
nor
moral
suasion
could
avail
for
it
is
certain
that
no
understands
english
i
thought
o
that
too
he
remarked
i
said
to
when
they
started
to
run
but
it
did
do
no
good
i
smiled
doubtless
said
i
the
spoken
language
of
the
is
made
up
of
similarly
primitive
exclamations
and
you
were
quite
right
in
attempting
to
communicate
with
the
and
establish
a
cordial
entente
professor
garner
has
done
so
among
the
simian
population
of
gaboon
your
attempt
is
most
creditable
and
i
shall
make
it
part
of
my
record
but
the
main
idea
is
to
capture
a
living
specimen
of
and
corroborate
every
detail
of
that
pursuit
and
capture
upon
the
films
and
believe
me
mink
i
added
my
voice
trembling
with
emotion
no
academician
is
likely
to
go
to
sleep
when
i
illustrate
my
address
with
such
pictures
as
you
are
now
about
to
take
the
police
might
pull
the
show
he
suggested
no
said
i
science
is
already
immune
art
is
becoming
so
only
nature
need
fear
the
violence
of
prejudice
and
doubtless
she
will
continue
to
wear
pantalettes
and
nighties
as
long
as
our
great
republic
endures
i
unslung
my
adjusted
them
and
took
a
penetrating
squint
at
the
hillside
above
nothing
stirred
up
there
except
a
buzzard
or
two
wheeling
on
pinions
above
the
palms
presently
mink
inquired
whether
i
had
lamped
anything
and
i
replied
that
i
had
not
they
may
be
snoozin
in
their
caves
he
suggested
but
do
you
fret
old
top
you
get
what
comin
to
you
and
i
get
mine
about
that
check
i
began
and
hesitated
sure
what
about
it
i
suppose
i
to
give
it
to
you
when
the
first
appears
that
what
i
pondered
the
matter
for
a
while
in
silence
i
could
see
no
risk
in
paying
him
this
draft
on
sight
all
right
i
said
bring
on
your
hour
succeeded
hour
but
no
came
down
to
the
pool
to
drink
we
ate
luncheon
a
bit
of
cold
duck
some
and
a
dish
of
i
smoked
an
inexpensive
cigar
mink
lit
a
more
pretentious
one
afterward
he
played
on
his
concertina
at
my
suggestion
on
the
chance
that
the
music
might
lure
a
down
the
hill
nymphs
were
sometimes
caught
that
way
and
modern
science
seems
to
be
reverting
more
and
more
closely
to
the
simpler
truths
of
the
classics
which
in
our
ignorance
and
arrogance
we
once
dismissed
as
fables
unworthy
of
scientific
notice
illustration
he
played
on
his
concertina
on
the
chance
that
the
music
might
lure
a
down
the
hill
however
this
broadway
faun
piped
in
vain
no
dryad
came
stealing
through
the
ferns
to
gaze
perhaps
to
dance
to
the
plaintive
melodies
so
after
a
while
he
put
his
concertina
into
his
pocket
cocked
his
derby
hat
on
one
side
gathered
his
little
bandy
legs
under
his
person
and
squatted
there
in
silence
chewing
the
wet
and
bitter
end
of
his
extinct
cigar
toward
i
unslung
my
again
and
surveyed
the
hill
at
first
i
noticed
nothing
not
even
a
buzzard
then
of
a
sudden
my
attention
was
attracted
to
something
moving
among
the
slabs
of
coquina
just
above
where
we
lay
concealed
a
slim
graceful
shape
half
shadowed
under
a
veil
of
lustrous
hair
which
glittered
like
gold
in
the
sun
mink
i
whispered
hoarsely
one
of
them
is
coming
this
this
indeed
is
the
stupendous
and
crowning
climax
of
my
scientific
career
his
comment
was
incredibly
coarse
gim
me
the
dough
he
said
without
a
tremor
of
surprise
indeed
there
was
a
metallic
ring
of
menace
in
his
low
and
entirely
cold
tones
as
he
laid
one
hand
on
my
arm
no
welchin
he
said
or
i
put
the
whole
show
on
the
bum
the
overwhelming
excitement
of
the
approaching
crisis
neutralized
my
disgust
i
fished
out
the
certified
check
from
my
pocket
and
flung
the
miserable
scrap
of
paper
at
him
get
your
machine
ready
i
hissed
do
you
understand
what
these
moments
mean
to
the
civilized
world
i
sure
do
he
said
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
lithe
white
figure
under
its
glorious
crown
of
hair
moving
warily
and
gracefully
amid
the
great
coquina
slabs
nearer
nearer
until
i
no
longer
required
my
glasses
illustration
moving
warily
and
gracefully
amid
the
great
coquina
slabs
she
was
a
slender
thing
dainty
of
hand
and
foot
the
spotted
pelt
of
a
covered
her
or
attempted
to
i
unfolded
a
large
canvas
sack
as
she
approached
the
pool
for
a
moment
or
two
she
stood
gazing
around
her
and
her
ears
seemed
to
be
listening
then
apparently
satisfied
she
threw
back
her
beautiful
young
head
and
sent
a
sweet
wild
call
floating
back
to
the
sunny
hillside
rang
her
silvery
voice
and
from
the
hollows
above
other
voices
replied
joyously
to
her
reassuring
call
the
whole
bunch
was
coming
down
to
drink
the
entire
remnant
of
a
prehistoric
and
almost
extinct
race
of
human
creatures
was
coming
to
quench
its
thirst
at
this
how
i
wished
for
james
barnes
at
the
camera
crank
he
alone
could
do
justice
to
this
golden
girl
before
me
one
by
one
clad
in
their
simple
yet
modest
gowns
of
pelts
and
garlands
five
exquisitively
superb
specimens
of
came
gracefully
down
to
the
to
drink
almost
swooning
with
scientific
excitement
i
whispered
to
the
unspeakable
mink
begin
to
crank
as
soon
as
i
move
and
gathering
up
my
big
canvas
sack
i
rose
and
still
crouching
stole
through
the
ferns
on
they
had
already
begun
to
drink
when
they
heard
me
i
must
have
made
some
slight
sound
in
the
ferns
for
their
keen
ears
detected
it
and
they
sprang
to
their
feet
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
to
see
them
there
by
the
pool
tense
motionless
at
gaze
their
dainty
noses
to
the
wind
their
beautiful
eyes
wide
and
alert
for
a
moment
enchanted
i
remained
spellbound
in
the
presence
of
this
prehistoric
spectacle
then
waving
my
sack
i
sprang
out
from
behind
the
rock
and
cantered
toward
them
instead
of
scattering
and
flying
up
the
hillside
they
seemed
paralyzed
huddling
together
as
though
to
get
into
the
picture
delighted
i
turned
and
glanced
at
mink
he
was
cranking
furiously
with
an
uncontrollable
shout
of
triumph
and
delight
i
pranced
toward
the
huddling
arms
outspread
as
though
heading
a
horse
or
concentrating
chickens
and
totally
forgetting
the
uselessness
of
urbanity
and
civilized
speech
as
i
danced
around
that
lovely
but
terrified
group
ladies
i
cried
do
not
be
alarmed
because
i
mean
only
kindness
and
proper
respect
civilization
calls
you
from
the
wilds
sentiment
pity
piety
propel
my
legs
not
the
ruthless
desire
to
injure
or
enslave
you
ladies
you
are
under
the
wing
of
science
an
anthropologist
is
speaking
to
you
fear
nothing
rather
rejoice
your
wonderful
race
shall
be
rescued
from
extinction
even
if
i
have
to
do
it
myself
ladies
do
run
they
had
suddenly
scattered
and
were
now
beginning
to
dodge
me
i
come
among
you
bearing
the
precious
promises
of
education
of
religion
of
equal
franchise
of
fashion
they
whimpered
continuing
to
dodge
me
yes
i
cried
in
an
excess
of
transcendental
enthusiasm
and
though
i
do
not
comprehend
the
exquisite
simplicity
of
your
primeval
speech
i
answer
with
all
my
heart
meanwhile
they
were
dodging
and
eluding
me
as
i
chased
first
one
then
another
one
hand
outstretched
the
other
invitingly
clutching
the
sack
a
hasty
glance
at
mink
now
and
then
revealed
him
industriously
cranking
away
once
i
fell
into
the
pool
that
section
of
the
film
should
never
be
released
i
determined
as
i
blew
the
water
out
of
my
mouth
gasped
and
started
after
a
lovely
whose
curiosity
had
led
her
to
linger
beside
the
pool
in
which
i
was
floundering
but
run
as
fast
as
i
could
and
skip
hither
and
thither
with
all
the
agility
i
could
muster
i
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
seize
a
single
every
few
minutes
baffled
and
breathless
i
rested
and
they
always
clustered
together
uttering
their
plaintively
musical
not
apparently
very
much
afraid
of
me
and
even
exhibiting
curiosity
now
and
then
they
cast
glances
toward
mink
who
was
grinding
away
steadily
and
i
could
scarcely
retain
a
shout
of
joy
as
i
realized
what
wonderful
pictures
he
was
taking
indeed
luck
seemed
to
be
with
me
so
far
for
never
once
did
these
beautiful
prehistoric
creatures
retire
out
of
photographic
range
but
otherwise
the
problem
was
becoming
serious
i
could
not
catch
one
of
them
they
eluded
me
with
maddening
swiftness
and
grace
my
pauses
to
recover
my
breath
became
more
frequent
at
last
dead
beat
i
sat
down
on
a
slab
of
coquina
and
when
i
was
able
to
articulate
i
turned
around
toward
mink
you
have
to
drop
your
camera
and
come
over
and
help
me
i
panted
i
all
in
not
quite
he
said
for
a
moment
i
did
not
understand
him
then
under
my
outraged
eyes
and
within
the
hearing
of
my
horrified
ears
a
terrible
thing
occurred
now
ladies
yelled
mink
all
on
for
the
there
you
little
mabel
take
the
call
now
smile
the
whole
bloomin
bunch
of
you
what
was
he
saying
i
did
not
comprehend
i
stared
dully
at
the
six
as
they
grouped
themselves
in
a
behind
me
then
as
one
of
them
came
up
and
unfolded
a
white
strip
of
cloth
behind
my
head
the
others
drew
from
concealed
pockets
in
their
kilts
of
little
silk
flags
of
all
nations
and
began
to
wave
them
paralyzed
i
turned
my
head
on
the
strip
of
white
cloth
which
the
tallest
was
holding
directly
behind
my
head
was
printed
in
large
black
letters
sunset
soap
for
one
cataclysmic
instant
i
gazed
upon
this
hideous
spectacle
then
with
an
unearthly
cry
i
collapsed
into
the
arms
of
the
nicest
looking
one
illustration
i
collapsed
into
the
arms
of
the
nicest
looking
one
there
is
little
more
to
say
contrary
to
my
fears
the
release
of
this
outrageous
film
did
not
injure
my
scientific
standing
modern
science
accustomed
to
proprietary
testimonials
has
become
reconciled
to
such
things
my
appearance
upon
the
films
in
the
movies
in
behalf
of
sunset
soap
oddly
enough
seemed
to
enhance
my
scientific
reputation
even
such
austere
purists
as
guilford
the
cubist
poet
congratulated
me
upon
my
fearless
independence
of
ethical
tradition
and
i
had
lived
to
learn
a
gentler
truth
than
that
for
the
pretty
girl
who
had
been
cast
for
no
but
let
that
pass
est
in
jocando
sweet
are
the
uses
of
advertisement
the
ladies
of
the
lake
i
at
the
suggestion
of
several
hundred
thousand
ladies
desiring
to
revel
and
possibly
riot
in
the
saturnalia
of
equal
franchise
the
unnamed
lakes
in
that
vast
and
little
known
region
in
alaska
bounded
by
the
ylanqui
river
and
the
thunder
mountains
were
now
being
inexorably
named
after
women
it
was
a
beautiful
thought
already
several
exquisite
lonely
bits
of
water
among
the
eternal
peaks
mirrors
for
cloud
and
soaring
eagle
a
glass
for
the
moon
as
keystone
to
the
towering
arch
of
stars
had
been
irrevocably
labelled
already
there
was
lake
amelia
jones
lake
sadie
dingleheimer
lake
maggie
mcfadden
and
lake
gladys
doolittle
batt
i
longed
to
see
these
lakes
under
the
glamour
of
their
newly
added
beauty
imagine
therefore
my
surprise
and
happiness
when
i
received
the
following
communication
from
my
revered
and
beloved
chief
professor
farrago
dated
from
the
smithsonian
institute
washington
whither
he
had
been
summoned
in
haste
to
examine
and
pronounce
upon
the
identity
of
a
very
small
bird
supposed
to
be
a
specimen
of
that
rare
and
almost
extinct
creature
the
titmouse
to
be
scientifically
exact
as
i
invariably
strive
to
be
the
important
letter
in
question
was
as
follows
to
percy
smith
curator
department
of
anthropology
administration
building
bronx
park
dear
several
very
important
and
determined
ladies
recently
honoured
by
the
government
in
having
a
number
of
lakes
in
alaska
named
after
them
have
decided
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
that
region
inspired
by
a
characteristic
desire
to
gaze
upon
the
lakes
named
after
them
individually
they
request
information
upon
the
following
points
are
the
waters
of
the
lakes
in
that
locality
sufficiently
clear
for
a
lady
to
do
her
hair
by
in
that
event
the
expedition
will
not
burden
itself
with
are
there
any
hotels
you
need
merely
say
no
i
have
tried
to
explain
to
them
that
it
is
for
the
most
part
an
unexplored
wilderness
but
they
insist
upon
further
information
from
you
if
there
are
hotels
is
there
also
running
water
to
be
had
you
may
tell
them
that
there
is
plenty
of
running
water
what
are
the
summer
outdoor
amusements
you
may
inform
them
that
there
is
plenty
of
bathing
boating
fishing
and
an
abundance
of
shade
trees
also
excellent
to
be
had
in
the
vicinity
you
need
not
mention
the
pastimes
of
hunt
the
flea
or
dodge
the
skeeter
i
am
not
by
nature
cruel
smith
but
when
these
ladies
informed
me
that
they
had
decided
to
penetrate
that
howling
and
unexplored
wilderness
without
being
burdened
or
interfered
with
by
any
member
of
my
sex
for
one
horrid
and
criminal
moment
i
hoped
they
would
because
in
that
event
none
of
them
would
ever
come
back
however
in
my
heart
milder
and
more
humane
sentiments
prevailed
i
pointed
out
to
them
the
peril
of
their
undertaking
the
dangers
of
an
unexplored
region
the
necessity
of
masculine
guidance
and
support
my
earnestness
and
solicitude
were
i
admit
prompted
partly
by
a
desire
to
utilize
this
expensively
projected
expedition
as
a
vehicle
for
the
accumulation
of
scientific
data
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
it
i
conceived
the
plan
of
attaching
two
members
of
our
bronx
park
scientific
staff
to
the
expedition
you
and
brown
but
no
sooner
did
these
determined
ladies
hear
of
it
than
they
repelled
the
suggestion
with
indignation
now
the
matter
stands
as
follows
these
ladies
do
want
any
man
in
the
expedition
but
they
have
at
last
realized
that
they
got
to
take
a
guide
or
two
and
there
are
no
feminine
guides
in
alaska
therefore
considering
the
immense
and
vital
importance
of
such
an
opportunity
to
explore
and
report
upon
this
unknown
region
at
somebody
else
expense
i
suggest
that
you
and
brown
meet
these
ladies
at
lake
susan
pillsbury
which
lies
on
the
edge
of
the
region
to
be
explored
that
you
without
actually
perjuring
yourselves
too
horribly
convey
to
them
the
misleading
impression
that
you
are
the
promised
guides
provided
for
them
by
a
cowed
and
avuncular
government
and
that
you
take
these
fearsome
ladies
about
and
let
them
gaze
at
their
reflections
in
the
various
lakes
named
after
them
and
that
while
the
expedition
lasts
you
secretly
make
such
observations
notes
reports
and
collections
of
the
flora
and
fauna
of
the
region
as
your
opportunities
may
permit
no
time
is
to
be
lost
if
at
lake
susan
pillsbury
you
find
regular
guides
awaiting
these
ladies
you
will
bribe
these
guides
to
go
away
and
you
yourselves
will
then
impersonate
the
guides
i
know
of
no
other
way
for
you
to
explore
this
region
as
all
our
available
resources
at
bronx
park
have
already
been
spent
in
painting
appropriate
scenery
to
line
the
cages
of
the
mammalia
and
also
in
the
present
exceedingly
expensive
expedition
in
search
of
the
which
is
supposed
to
inhabit
the
jungle
beyond
lake
niggerplug
my
most
solemn
and
sincere
wishes
accompany
you
bless
you
farrago
ii
this
then
is
how
it
came
about
that
kitten
brown
and
i
were
seated
one
midgeful
morning
in
july
by
the
pellucid
waters
of
lake
susan
pillsbury
gnawing
sections
from
a
greasily
fried
trout
upon
which
i
had
attempted
culinary
operations
brown
baptismal
name
was
william
but
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
once
discovered
indiscreetly
embracing
a
pretty
assistant
in
the
administration
building
at
bronx
and
furthermore
was
overheard
to
address
her
as
kitten
so
kitten
brown
it
was
for
him
in
future
after
he
had
fought
all
the
younger
members
of
the
scientific
staff
in
turn
he
gradually
became
resigned
to
this
annoying
lightly
but
thoroughly
equipped
for
scientific
field
research
we
had
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
in
time
to
bribe
the
two
guides
engaged
by
the
government
to
go
back
to
their
own
firesides
a
week
later
the
formidable
expedition
of
representative
ladies
arrived
and
now
they
were
sitting
on
the
shore
of
lake
susan
pillsbury
at
a
little
distance
from
us
trying
to
keep
the
midges
from
their
features
and
attempting
to
eat
the
fare
provided
for
them
by
me
i
myself
could
eat
it
no
wonder
they
murmured
but
hunger
goaded
them
to
attack
the
greasy
mess
of
trout
and
fried
cornmeal
kitten
was
saying
to
me
our
medicine
chest
is
very
extensive
i
hope
they
brought
their
own
if
they
did
some
among
us
will
never
again
see
new
york
i
stole
a
furtive
glance
at
the
unfortunate
women
there
was
one
among
them
but
let
me
first
enumerate
their
heavy
artillery
there
was
the
reverend
amelia
jones
blond
adipose
and
close
to
the
mark
she
stepped
high
in
the
equal
franchise
ranks
nobody
had
ever
had
the
temerity
to
answer
her
back
there
was
miss
sadie
dingleheimer
fifty
emaciated
anemic
and
gauntly
glittering
with
she
was
the
president
of
the
national
prophylactic
club
whatever
that
may
be
there
was
miss
margaret
mcfadden
a
titian
profusely
toothed
muscular
and
president
of
the
hair
dressers
union
of
the
united
states
there
was
gladys
doolittle
batt
a
grass
one
batt
being
represented
as
a
vanishing
point
president
of
the
national
eugenic
and
purity
league
tall
gnarled
sinuously
powerful
and
prone
to
emotional
attacks
the
attacks
were
directed
toward
others
these
then
composed
the
heavy
artillery
the
artillery
of
the
light
brigade
consisted
only
of
a
single
piece
her
name
was
angelica
white
a
delegate
from
the
trained
nurses
association
of
america
the
nurses
had
been
too
busy
with
their
business
to
attend
such
picnics
so
one
had
been
selected
by
lot
to
represent
the
busy
association
on
this
expedition
angelica
white
was
a
tall
fair
girl
of
or
three
with
eyes
and
red
lips
and
a
way
of
smiling
a
little
when
spoken
to
but
let
that
pass
i
mean
only
to
be
scientifically
minute
a
passion
for
fact
has
ever
obsessed
me
i
have
little
literary
ability
and
less
desire
to
sully
my
pen
with
that
degraded
form
of
letters
known
as
fiction
once
in
my
life
my
mania
for
accuracy
involved
me
lyrically
it
was
a
short
poem
but
an
earnest
one
truth
is
mighty
and
must
prevail
otherwise
it
were
inadvisable
to
tell
the
tale
i
bestowed
it
upon
the
new
york
but
declined
remuneration
my
message
belonged
to
the
world
i
do
mean
the
newspaper
her
eyes
then
were
tinted
with
that
indefinable
and
agreeable
nuance
which
modifies
blue
to
a
lilac
or
violet
hue
watching
her
askance
i
was
deeply
sorry
that
my
cooking
seemed
to
pain
her
guide
said
doolittle
batt
in
that
remarkable
booming
voice
of
hers
said
kitten
brown
and
i
with
spontaneous
alacrity
leaping
from
the
ground
as
though
shot
at
this
cooking
she
said
with
an
ominous
stare
at
us
is
atrocious
do
you
know
how
to
cook
i
said
with
a
smiling
attempt
at
ease
there
are
various
ways
of
cooking
food
for
the
several
species
of
mammalia
which
an
providence
do
you
think
you
cooking
for
she
demanded
our
smiles
faded
it
my
opinion
that
you
incompetent
remarked
the
reverend
jones
slapping
at
midges
with
a
hand
that
might
have
rocked
all
the
cradles
of
the
nation
but
had
not
rocked
any
we
not
getting
our
money
worth
said
miss
dingleheimer
even
if
the
government
does
pay
your
salaries
i
looked
appealingly
from
one
stony
face
to
another
in
miss
eye
there
was
the
somber
glint
of
battle
she
said
if
you
can
guide
us
no
better
than
you
cook
god
save
us
all
this
day
week
and
she
hurled
the
contents
of
her
tin
plate
into
lake
susan
pillsbury
doolittle
batt
arose
come
she
said
it
is
time
we
started
what
is
the
name
of
the
first
lake
we
may
hope
to
encounter
we
knew
no
more
than
did
they
but
we
said
that
lake
gladys
doolittle
batt
was
the
first
hoping
to
placate
that
fearsome
woman
come
on
then
she
cried
picking
up
her
carved
and
varnished
mountain
staff
miss
dingleheimer
had
brought
one
too
from
the
catskills
so
kitten
brown
and
i
loaded
our
mule
set
him
in
motion
and
drove
him
forward
into
the
unknown
where
we
were
going
we
had
not
the
slightest
idea
the
margin
of
the
lake
was
easy
travelling
so
easy
that
we
never
noticed
that
we
had
already
gone
around
the
lake
three
times
until
batt
recognized
the
fact
and
turned
on
us
furiously
i
did
know
how
to
explain
it
except
to
say
feebly
that
i
was
doing
it
as
a
sort
of
preliminary
canter
to
harden
and
inure
the
ladies
we
do
need
hardening
she
snarled
do
you
understand
that
i
comprehended
that
at
once
but
i
forced
a
sickly
smile
and
skipped
forward
in
the
wake
of
my
mule
with
something
of
the
same
abandon
which
characterizes
the
flight
of
an
unwelcome
dog
in
the
terrified
ear
of
kitten
i
voiced
my
doubts
concerning
the
prospects
of
a
pleasant
journey
we
marched
in
the
following
order
arthur
the
heavily
laden
mule
led
then
came
kitten
brown
and
myself
all
hung
over
with
shotguns
rifles
ponchos
and
the
toilet
reticules
of
the
ladies
then
marched
the
reverend
jones
and
in
order
filing
behind
her
miss
dingleheimer
batt
miss
mcfadden
and
miss
white
the
latter
in
her
trained
nurse
costume
and
wearing
a
red
cross
on
her
sleeve
an
idea
of
batt
who
believed
in
emergency
methods
batt
also
bore
a
banner
much
interfered
with
by
the
foliage
bearing
the
inscription
equal
rights
eugenics
or
extermination
after
a
while
she
shouted
guide
here
you
may
carry
this
banner
for
a
while
i
tired
kitten
and
i
took
turns
with
it
after
that
it
was
hard
work
particularly
as
one
by
one
in
turn
they
came
up
and
hung
their
parasols
and
shopping
reticules
all
over
us
we
plodded
forward
like
a
pair
of
moving
department
stores
not
daring
to
shift
our
burdens
to
arthur
because
we
had
already
stuffed
into
the
panniers
of
that
simple
and
dignified
animal
all
our
collecting
boxes
cyanide
jars
butterfly
nets
reels
of
piano
wire
thermometers
barometers
hydrometers
stereometers
aeronoids
adnoids
everything
in
fact
that
guides
are
not
supposed
to
pack
into
the
woods
but
which
we
had
smuggled
unbeknown
to
those
misguided
ones
we
guided
and
to
make
room
for
our
scientific
paraphernalia
we
had
been
obliged
to
do
a
thing
so
mean
so
inexpressibly
low
that
i
blush
to
relate
it
but
facts
are
facts
we
discarded
nearly
a
ton
of
feminine
impedimenta
there
was
fancy
work
of
all
sorts
in
the
making
or
in
the
raw
materials
for
knitting
embroidering
tatting
sewing
hemming
stitching
crocheting
also
we
disposed
of
almost
half
a
ton
of
toilet
necessities
powder
perfumery
cosmetics
bags
slippers
negligees
novels
magazines
gloves
stockings
underwear
we
left
enough
apparel
for
each
lady
to
change
once
they
have
to
do
some
scrubbing
now
science
can
not
be
halted
by
hatpins
cosmos
can
not
be
by
cosmetics
toward
sunset
we
came
upon
a
small
crystal
clear
pond
set
between
the
bases
of
several
lofty
mountains
i
was
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
but
i
nerved
myself
drew
a
deep
exultant
breath
and
with
one
of
those
fine
sweeping
gestures
i
cried
lake
gladys
doolittle
batt
eureka
at
last
excelsior
there
was
a
profound
silence
behind
me
i
turned
striving
to
mask
my
apprehension
with
a
smile
the
ladies
were
regarding
the
pond
in
surprise
i
admit
that
it
was
a
pond
not
a
lake
injecting
into
my
voice
the
last
remnants
of
glee
which
i
could
summon
i
shouted
eureka
and
began
to
caper
about
as
though
the
size
and
beauty
of
the
pond
had
affected
me
with
irrepressible
enthusiasm
hoping
by
my
emotion
to
stampede
the
convention
the
cold
voice
of
doolittle
batt
checked
my
transports
is
that
puddle
named
after
me
she
demanded
i
stammered
if
that
wretched
has
been
christened
with
my
name
somebody
is
going
to
get
into
trouble
she
said
ominously
a
profound
silence
ensued
arthur
patiently
switched
at
flies
as
for
me
i
looked
up
at
the
majestic
pines
gazed
upon
the
lofty
and
eternal
hills
then
ventured
a
sneaking
glance
all
around
me
but
i
could
discover
no
avenue
of
escape
in
case
batt
should
charge
me
i
had
been
informed
she
began
dangerously
that
the
majestic
body
of
water
which
i
understood
had
been
honoured
with
my
name
was
twelve
miles
long
and
three
miles
wide
this
appears
to
be
a
puddle
it
very
i
protested
feebly
it
quite
round
and
clear
and
it
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
mind
your
business
retorted
doolittle
batt
i
been
swindled
kitten
brown
knew
more
about
women
than
did
i
he
said
in
a
fairly
steady
voice
madame
it
is
an
outrage
the
women
of
this
mighty
nation
should
make
the
government
answerable
for
its
duplicity
your
lake
should
have
been
at
least
twenty
miles
long
everybody
turned
and
looked
at
kitten
he
was
a
handsome
dog
this
young
man
appears
to
have
some
trace
of
said
batt
i
shall
see
to
it
that
the
government
is
held
responsible
for
this
odious
act
of
insulting
duplicity
i
i
wo
have
my
name
given
to
this
this
wallow
she
advanced
toward
me
her
small
eyes
blazing
i
retreated
to
leeward
of
arthur
guide
she
said
in
a
voice
still
trembling
with
passion
are
you
certain
that
you
have
made
no
mistake
you
appear
to
be
unusually
ignorant
i
am
afraid
there
can
be
no
room
for
doubt
i
said
almost
scared
out
of
my
senses
and
on
top
of
this
outrage
am
i
to
eat
your
cooking
she
demanded
passionately
did
i
come
here
to
look
at
this
and
choke
on
your
cooking
i
can
cook
said
a
clear
pleasant
voice
at
my
elbow
and
miss
white
came
forward
cool
clean
fresh
as
a
posy
in
her
uniform
and
cap
i
immediately
got
behind
her
i
can
cook
very
nicely
she
said
smilingly
it
is
part
of
my
profession
you
know
so
if
you
two
guides
will
be
kind
enough
to
build
the
fire
and
help
me
she
let
her
violet
eyes
linger
on
me
for
an
instant
then
on
brown
a
moment
later
he
and
i
were
jostling
each
other
in
our
eagerness
to
obey
her
slightest
suggestion
it
is
that
way
with
men
so
we
built
her
a
fire
and
unpacked
our
provisions
and
we
waited
very
politely
on
the
ladies
when
dinner
was
ready
it
was
a
fine
dinner
coffee
bacon
soup
stewed
chicken
the
heavy
artillery
made
ravenous
by
their
journey
required
vast
quantities
of
ammunition
they
banqueted
largely
i
gazed
in
amazement
at
doolittle
batt
as
she
swallowed
one
after
another
while
her
eyes
bulged
larger
and
larger
nor
was
the
capacity
of
miss
dingleheimer
and
the
reverend
jones
to
be
mocked
at
by
pachyderms
brown
and
i
left
them
eating
while
we
erected
the
row
of
little
tents
every
lady
had
demanded
a
separate
tent
so
we
cut
saplings
set
up
the
silk
drove
pegs
and
brought
armfuls
of
balsam
boughs
i
was
afraid
they
demand
their
knitting
and
other
utensils
but
they
had
eaten
to
repletion
and
were
sleepy
and
as
each
toilet
case
or
reticule
contained
also
a
nightgown
they
drew
the
flaps
of
their
several
tents
without
insisting
that
we
unpack
arthur
panniers
they
all
had
disappeared
within
their
tents
except
miss
white
who
insisted
on
cooking
something
for
us
although
we
protested
that
the
scraps
of
the
banquet
were
all
right
for
mere
guides
she
stood
beside
us
for
a
few
minutes
watching
us
busy
with
our
delicious
dinner
you
poor
fellows
she
said
gently
you
are
nearly
starved
it
is
agreeable
to
be
sympathized
with
by
a
tall
fair
fresh
young
girl
we
looked
up
simpering
gratefully
this
is
really
a
most
lovely
little
lake
she
said
gazing
out
across
the
still
crystalline
water
which
was
all
rose
and
gold
in
the
sunset
save
where
the
sombre
shapes
of
the
towering
mountains
were
mirrored
in
glassy
depths
it
odd
i
said
that
no
trout
are
jumping
there
ought
to
be
lots
of
them
there
and
this
is
their
jumping
hour
we
all
looked
at
the
quiet
oval
bit
of
water
not
a
circle
not
the
slightest
ripple
disturbed
it
it
must
be
deep
remarked
brown
we
gazed
up
at
the
three
lofty
peaks
the
bases
of
which
were
the
shores
of
this
tiny
gem
among
lakes
deep
deep
plunging
down
into
dusky
profundity
the
rocks
fell
away
sheer
into
limpid
depths
that
little
lake
may
be
a
thousand
feet
deep
i
said
in

of
bronx
park
measured
a
lake
in
the
thunder
mountains
which
was
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
feet
deep
miss
white
looked
at
me
curiously
into
a
patch
of
late
sunshine
flitted
a
small
butterfly
one
of
the
species
it
settled
on
a
chip
of
wood
uncoiled
its
delicate
proboscis
and
spread
its
fulvous
and
deeply
indented
wings
remarked
brown
to
me
i
corrected
him
note
the
anal
angle
of
the
secondaries
and
the
argentiferous
discal
area
bordering
the
subcostal
nervule
the
characteristic
stripes
on
the
primaries
are
wanting
he
demurred
it
is
double
brooded
the
summer
form
lacks
the
three
darker
bands
a
few
moments
silence
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
miss
white
i
had
no
idea
she
remarked
that
alaskan
guides
were
so
familiar
with
entomological
terms
and
nomenclature
we
both
turned
very
red
brown
mumbled
something
about
having
picked
up
a
smattering
i
added
that
brown
had
taught
me
perhaps
she
believed
us
her
blue
eyes
rested
on
us
curiously
musingly
also
at
moments
i
fancied
there
was
the
faintest
glint
of
amusement
in
them
she
said
two
scientific
gentlemen
from
new
york
requested
permission
to
join
this
expedition
but
batt
refused
them
she
gazed
thoughtfully
upon
the
waters
of
lake
gladys
doolittle
batt
i
wonder
she
murmured
what
became
of
those
two
gentlemen
it
was
evident
that
we
had
betrayed
ourselves
to
this
young
girl
she
glanced
at
us
again
and
perhaps
she
noticed
in
our
fascinated
gaze
an
expression
akin
to
terror
for
suddenly
she
laughed
such
a
clear
sweet
silvery
little
laugh
for
my
part
she
said
i
wish
they
had
come
with
us
i
like
men
with
that
she
bade
us
goodnight
very
politely
and
went
off
to
her
tent
leaving
us
with
our
hats
pressed
against
our
stomachs
attempting
by
the
profundity
of
our
bows
to
indicate
the
depth
of
our
gratitude
a
girl
exclaimed
brown
as
soon
as
she
had
disappeared
behind
her
tent
flaps
she
never
let
on
to
medusa
xantippe
cassandra
and
company
i
that
girl
smith
you
not
the
only
one
imbued
by
such
sentiments
said
i
he
smiled
a
fatuous
and
reminiscent
smile
he
certainly
was
presently
he
said
she
has
the
most
delightful
way
of
gazing
at
a
man
i
noticed
i
said
pleasantly
oh
did
she
happen
to
glance
at
that
way
he
inquired
i
wanted
to
beat
him
all
i
said
was
she
certainly
some
kitten
which
bottled
that
young
man
for
a
while
we
lay
on
the
bank
of
the
tiny
lake
our
backs
against
a
huge
watching
the
last
traces
of
colour
fading
from
peak
and
is
it
queer
i
said
that
not
a
trout
has
splashed
it
ca
be
that
there
are
no
fish
in
the
lake
there
such
lakes
yes
very
deep
ones
i
wonder
how
deep
this
is
we
be
out
at
sunrise
with
our
reel
of
piano
wire
and
take
soundings
he
said
the
heavy
artillery
wo
wake
until
they
ready
to
be
loaded
with
i
shuddered
they
fearsome
creatures
brown
somehow
that
resolute
and
bony
one
has
inspired
me
with
a
terror
unutterable
mrs
batt
yes
he
said
seriously
she
make
a
horrid
outcry
when
she
asks
for
her
knitting
what
are
you
going
to
tell
her
i
shall
say
that
indians
ambuscaded
us
while
she
was
asleep
and
carried
off
all
those
things
you
lie
very
nicely
do
you
he
remarked
admiringly
vitium
ducit
culpæ
said
i
besides
they
do
really
need
those
articles
he
laughed
he
did
seem
to
be
very
much
afraid
of
batt
it
had
grown
deliciously
dusky
and
myriads
of
stars
were
coming
out
little
by
little
the
lake
lost
its
shape
in
the
darkness
until
only
an
irregular
area
of
quiet
water
indicated
that
there
was
any
lake
there
at
all
i
remember
that
brown
and
i
reclining
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
were
looking
at
the
still
and
starry
surface
of
the
lake
over
which
numbers
of
bats
were
darting
after
insects
and
i
recollect
that
i
was
just
about
to
speak
when
of
a
sudden
the
silent
and
luminous
surface
of
the
water
was
shattered
as
with
a
subterranean
explosion
a
geyser
of
scintillating
spray
shot
upward
flashing
foaming
towering
a
hundred
feet
into
the
air
and
through
it
i
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
vast
quivering
twisting
mass
of
silver
falling
back
with
a
crash
into
the
lake
while
the
huge
fountain
rained
spray
on
every
side
and
the
little
lake
rocked
and
heaved
from
shore
to
shore
sending
great
sheets
of
surf
up
over
the
rocks
so
high
that
the
very
dripped
petrified
dumb
our
senses
almost
paralyzed
by
the
shock
our
ears
still
deafened
by
the
watery
crash
of
that
gigantic
something
that
had
fallen
into
the
lake
and
our
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
we
stared
at
the
darkness
slap
slash
slush
went
the
waves
hitting
the
shore
with
a
clashing
sound
almost
metallic
vision
and
hearing
told
us
that
the
water
in
the
lake
was
rocking
like
the
contents
of
a
lord
whispered
brown
is
there
a
under
that
lake
did
you
see
that
huge
glittering
shape
that
seemed
to
fall
into
the
water
i
gasped
yes
what
was
it
a
meteor
no
it
was
something
that
first
came
out
of
the
lake
and
fell
back
the
way
a
trout
leaps
heavens
it
could
have
been
alive
could
it
do
you
mean
stammered
brown
it
could
have
been
a
could

asked
with
chattering
teeth
no
it
was
as
big
as
a
pullman
car
it
must
have
been
a
falling
star
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
fish
as
big
as
a
sleeping
car
i
was
too
thoroughly
unnerved
to
reply
the
roaring
of
the
surf
had
subsided
somewhat
enough
for
another
sound
to
reach
our
ears
a
raucous
gallinacious
squawking
sound
i
sprang
up
and
looked
at
the
row
of
tents
figures
loomed
in
front
of
them
the
heavy
artillery
was
evidently
frightened
illustration
the
heavy
artillery
was

frightened
we
went
over
to
them
and
when
we
got
nearer
they
chastely
scuttled
into
their
tents
and
thrust
out
a
row
of
heads

hideous
with
what
was

awful
noise
an
earthquake

the
reverend
jones

it
an
avalanche
demanded
batt
in
a
deep
and
shaky
voice
are
we
in
any
immediate
danger
young
man

said
that
it
was
probably
a
which
had
happened
to
strike
the
lake
and
explode
what
an
awful
region
wailed
miss
dingleheimer
i
had

meteor
falls

latitude

said
soothingly

it
might
be
ten
minutes
sobbed
miss
dingleheimer
what
do
know
about
it
anyway
i
want
to
go
home

putting
on
my
stockings
now
i
getting
dressed
as
fast
as
i
can
her
voice
was
blotted
out
in
a
mighty
crash
from
the
lake
appalled
i
whirled
on
my
heel
just
in
time
to
see
another
huge
jet
of
water
rise
high
in
the
starlight
another
another
until
the
entire
lake
was
but
a
cluster
of
gigantic
geysers
exploding
a
hundred
feet
in
the
air
while
through
them
falling
back
into
the
smother
of
furious
foam
great
silvery
bulks
dropped
crashing
one
after
another
i
do
know
how
long
the
incredible
vision
lasted
the
woods
roared
with
the
infernal
pandemonium
echoed
and
from
mountain
to
mountain
the
fairly
stormed
spray
driving
it
in
sheets
through
the
leaves
and
the
shores
of
the
lake
spouted
surf
long
after
the
last
vast
silvery
shape
had
fallen
back
again
into
the
water
as
my
senses
gradually
recovered
i
found
myself
supporting
batt
on
one
arm
and
the
reverend
jones
upon
my
bosom
both
had
fainted
i
released
them
with
a
shudder
and
turned
to
look
for
brown
somebody
had
swooned
in
his
arms
too
illustration
somebody
had
swooned
in
his
arms
too
he
was
not
noticing
me
and
as
i
approached
him
i
heard
him
say
something
resembling
the
word
kitten
in
spite
of
my
demoralization
another
fear
seized
me
and
i
drew
nearer
and
peered
closely
at
what
he
was
holding
so
nobly
in
his
arms
it
was
as
i
supposed
angelica
white
i
do
know
whether
my
arrival
occultly
revived
her
for
as
i
stumbled
over
a
she
opened
her
blue
eyes
and
then
disengaged
herself
from
brown
arms
oh
i
am
frightened
she
murmured
she
looked
at
me
sideways
when
she
said
it
come
said
i
coldly
to
brown
let
miss
white
retire
and
lie
down
this
meteoric
shower
is
over
and
so
is
the
danger
he
evinced
a
desire
to
further
soothe
and
minister
to
miss
white
but
she
said
with
considerable
composure
that
she
was
feeling
better
and
brown
came
unwillingly
with
me
to
inspect
the
heavy
artillery
lines
that
formidable
battery
was
wrecked
the
pieces
dismounted
and
lying
tumbled
about
in
their
emplacements
but
a
vigorous
course
of
cold
water
in
dippers
revived
them
and
we
herded
them
into
one
tent
and
quieted
them
with
some
soothing
prevarication
the
details
of
which
i
have
forgotten
but
it
was
something
about
a
flock
of
meteors
which
hit
the
earth
every
twelve
billion
years
and
that
it
was
now
all
over
for
another
such
interim
and
everybody
could
sleep
soundly
with
the
consciousness
of
having
assisted
at
a
spectacle
never
before
beheld
except
by
a
primordial
protoplasmic
cell
which
flattered
them
i
think
for
seated
once
more
at
the
base
of
our
tree
presently
we
heard
weird
noises
from
the
reconcentrados
like
the
moaning
of
the
harbour
bar
they
slept
the
heavy
guns
like
unawakened
engines
of
destruction
all
in
battery
but
brown
and
i
fearfully
excited
still
dazed
and
bewildered
sat
with
our
fascinated
eyes
fixed
on
the
lake
asking
each
other
what
in
the
name
of
miracles
it
was
that
we
had
witnessed
and
heard
on
one
thing
we
were
agreed
a
scientific
discovery
of
the
most
enormous
importance
awaited
our
investigation
this
was
no
time
for
temporising
for
deception
for
any
species
of
polite
we
must
on
the
morrow
tear
off
our
masks
and
appear
before
these
misguided
and
feminine
victims
of
our
duplicity
in
our
own
characters
as
scientists
we
must
boldly
avow
our
identities
and
flatly
refuse
to
stir
from
this
spot
until
the
mystery
of
this
astounding
lake
had
been
thoroughly
investigated
and
so
discussing
our
policy
our
plans
for
the
morrow
and
mutually
reassuring
each
other
concerning
our
common
ability
to
successfully
defy
the
heavy
artillery
we
finally
fell
asleep
iii
dawn
awoke
me
and
i
sat
up
in
my
blanket
and
aroused

no
birds
were
singing
it
seemed
unusual
and
i
spoke
of
it
to
brown
never
have
i
witnessed
such
a
still
strange
daybreak
mountains
woods
and
water
were
curiously
silent
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
nothing
stirred
except
the
thin
veil
of
vapour
over
the
water
shreds
of
which
were
now
parting
from
the
shore
and
steaming
slowly
upward
there
was
it
seemed
to
me
something
slightly
uncanny
about
this
lake
even
in
repose
the
water
seemed
as
translucent
as
a
dark
crystal
and
as
motionless
as
the
surface
of
a
mirror
nothing
stirred
its
placid
surface
not
a
ripple
not
an
insect
not
a
leaf
floating
brown
had
lugged
the
pneumatic
raft
down
to
the
shore
where
he
was
now
pumping
it
full
i
followed
with
the
paddles
pole
and
hydroscope
when
the
raft
had
been
pumped
up
and
was
afloat
we
carried
the
reel
of
gossamer
aboard
followed
it
pushed
off
and
paddled
quietly
through
the
level
cobwebs
of
mist
toward
the
centre
of
the
lake
from
the
shore
i
heard
a
gruesome
noise
it
originated
under
one
of
the
row
of
tents
of
the
heavy
artillery
medusa
snoring
was
an
awesome
sound
in
that
wilderness
and
solitude
of
dawn
i
was
unscrewing
the
from
the
raft
and
screwing
into
the
empty
socket
the
lens
of
the
hydroscope
and
attaching
the
battery
while
brown
started
his
sounding
and
i
was
still
busy
when
an
exclamation
from
my
companion
started
me
we
breaking
some
records
do
you
know
it
smith
where
is
the
lead
three
hundred
fathoms
and
still
running
nonsense
look
at
it
yourself
it
goes
on
unreeling
i
put
the
drag
on
hurry
and
adjust
the
hydroscope
i
sighted
the
powerful
instrument
for
two
thousand
feet
altering
it
from
minute
to
minute
as
brown
excitedly
announced
the
amazing
depth
of
the
lake
when
he
called
out
four
thousand
feet
i
stared
at
him
there
something
wrong
i
began
there
wrong
he
interrupted
four
thousand
five
hundred
five
thousand
five
thousand
five
hundred
are
you
squatting
there
and
trying
to
tell
me
that
this
lake
is
over
a
mile
deep
look
for
yourself
he
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
here
is
the
tape
you
can
read
ca
you
six
thousand
feet
and
running
evenly
six
thousand
five
hundred
seven
thousand
seven
thousand
five
it
be
i
protested
but
it
was
true
astounded
i
continued
to
adjust
the
hydroscope
to
a
range
incredible
turning
the
screw
to
focus
at
a
mile
and
a
half
at
two
miles
at
two
and
a
quarter
a
half
three
miles
three
miles
and
a
quarter
click
good
heavens
he
whispered
this
lake
is
three
miles
and
a
quarter
deep
mechanically
i
set
the
lachet
screwed
the
hood
firm
drew
out
the
black
locked
it
then
kneeling
on
the
raft
i
rested
my
face
in
the
mask
felt
for
the
lever
and
switched
on
the
electric
light
quicker
than
thought
the
solid
lance
of
dazzling
light
plunged
down
through
profundity
and
the
vast
abyss
of
water
was
revealed
along
its
pathway
nothing
moved
in
those
tremendous
depths
except
nearly
two
miles
below
a
few
spots
of
tinsel
glittered
and
drifted
like
flakes
of
mica
at
first
i
scarcely
noticed
them
supposing
them
to
be
vast
beds
of
silvery
bottom
sand
glittering
under
the
electric
pencil
of
the
hydroscope
but
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
these
brilliant
specks
in
motion
were
not
on
the
bottom
were
a
little
less
than
two
miles
deep
and
therefore
suspended
to
be
seen
at
all
at
two
miles
depth
whatever
they
were
they
must
have
considerable
bulk
do
you
see
anything
demanded
brown
some
silvery
specks
at
a
depth
of
two
miles
what
do
they
look
like
specks
are
they
in
motion
they
seem
to
be
do
they
come
any
nearer
after
a
while
i
answered
one
of
the
specks
seems
to
be
growing
larger
i
believe
it
is
in
motion
and
is
floating
slowly
upward
it
certainly
getting
bigger
it
getting
longer
is
it
a
fish
it
ca
be
why
not
it
impossible
fish
do
attain
the
size
of
whales
in
mountain
ponds
there
was
a
silence
after
an
interval
i
said
brown
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
that
thing
is
it
coming
any
nearer
yes
what
does
it
look
like
now
it
like
a
fish
but
it
ca
be
it
looks
like
a
tiny
silver
minnow
but
it
ca
be
why
if
it
resembles
a
minnow
in
size
at
this
distance
what
can
be
its
actual
dimensions
let
me
look
he
said
unwillingly
i
raised
my
head
from
the
mask
and
yielded
him
my
place
a
long
silence
followed
the
western
reddened
under
the
rising
sun
the
sky
grew
faintly
bluer
yet
there
was
not
a
in
that
still
place
not
a
flash
of
wings
nothing
stirring
here
and
there
along
the
lake
shore
i
noticed
trees
very
trees
indeed
for
their
trunks
seemed
bleached
and
dead
and
as
though
no
bark
covered
them
yet
every
stark
limb
was
covered
with
foliage
a
thick
foliage
so
dark
in
colour
that
it
seemed
black
to
me
i
glanced
at
my
motionless
companion
where
he
knelt
with
his
face
in
the
mask
then
i
unslung
my
and
focussed
them
on
the
nearest
of
the
curious
trees
at
first
i
could
not
quite
make
out
what
i
was
looking
at
then
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
that
these
stark
gray
trees
were
indeed
lifeless
and
that
what
i
had
mistaken
for
dark
foliage
were
velvety
clusters
of
bats
hanging
there
asleep
thousands
of
them
thickly
infesting
and
clotting
the
dead
branches
with
a
sombre
and
horrid
effect
of
foliage
i
do
mind
bats
in
ordinary
numbers
but
in
such
soft
motionless
masses
they
slightly
sickened
me
there
must
have
been
literally
tons
of
them
hanging
to
the
dead
trees
this
is
pleasant
i
said
look
at
those
bats
brown
when
brown
spoke
without
lifting
his
head
his
voice
was
so
shaken
so
altered
that
the
mere
sound
of
it
scared
me
smith
he
said
there
is
a
fish
in
here
shaped
exactly
like
a
brook
minnow
and
i
should
judge
by
the
depth
it
is
swimming
in
that
it
is
about
as
long
as
an
ordinary
pullman
car
his
voice
shook
but
his
words
were
calm
to
the
point
of
commonplace
which
made
the
effect
of
his
statement
all
the
more
terrific
a
a
as
big
as
a
pullman
car
i
repeated
dazed
larger
i
think
it
looks
to
me
through
the
hydroscope
at
this
distance
exactly
like
a
tiny
silvery
minnow
it
half
a
mile
down
swimming
about
i
can
see
its
eyes
they
must
be
about
ten
feet
in
diameter
i
can
see
its
fins
moving
and
there
are
about
a
dozen
others
much
deeper
swimming
around
this
is
easily
the
most
overwhelming
contribution
made
to
science
since
the
discovery
of
the
we
got
to
catch
one
of
those
gigantic
fish
how
i
gasped
how
are
we
going
to
catch
a
minnow
as
large
as
a
sleeping
car
i
do
know
but
we
got
to
do
it
we
got
to
manage
it
somehow
it
would
require
a
steel
cable
to
hold
such
a
fish
and
a
donkey
engine
to
reel
him
in
and
what
about
a
hook
and
if
we
had
hook
line
and
everything
else
about
bait
he
knelt
for
some
time
longer
watching
the
fish
before
he
resigned
the
hydroscope
to
me
then
i
watched
it
but
it
came
no
nearer
seeming
contented
to
swim
about
at
the
depth
of
a
little
more
than
half
a
mile
deep
under
this
fish
i
could
see
others
glittering
as
they
sailed
or
darted
to
and
fro
presently
i
raised
my
head
and
sat
thinking
the
sun
now
gilded
the
water
a
little
breeze
ruffled
it
here
and
there
where
dainty
played
over
the
surface
what
on
earth
do
you
suppose
those
gigantic
fish
feed
on
asked
brown
under
his
breath
i
thought
a
moment
longer
then
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
of
understanding
and
i
pointed
at
the
dead
trees
bats
i
muttered
they
feed
on
bats
as
other
fish
feed
on
the
little
flies
which
dance
over
ponds
you
saw
those
bats
flying
over
the
pond
last
night
did
you
that
explains
the
whole
thing
do
you
understand
why
what
we
saw
were
these
gigantic
fish
leaping
like
trout
after
the
bats
it
was
their
feeding
time
i
do
not
imagine
that
two
more
excited
scientists
ever
existed
than
brown
and
i
the
joy
of
discovery
transfigured
us
here
we
had
discovered
a
lake
in
the
thunder
mountains
which
was
the
deepest
lake
in
the
world
and
it
was
inhabited
by
a
few
gigantic
fish
of
the
minnow
species
the
existence
of
which
hitherto
had
never
even
been
dreamed
of
by
science
kitten
i
said
my
voice
broken
by
emotion
which
will
you
have
named
after
you
the
lake
or
the
fish
shall
it
be
lake
kitten
brown
or
shall
it
be
speak
what
about
that
old
party
whose
name
you
said
had
already
been
given
to
the
lake
he
asked
piteously
who
batt
do
you
think
i
name
such
an
important
lake
after
anyway
she
has
declined
the
honour
very
well
he
said
i
accept
it
and
the
fish
shall
be
known
as
too
deeply
moved
to
speak
we
bent
over
and
shook
hands
with
each
other
in
that
solemn
and
holy
moment
surcharged
with
ecstatic
emotion
a
deep
distant
reverberation
came
across
the
water
to
our
ears
it
was
the
heavy
artillery
snoring
never
can
i
forget
that
scene
sunshine
glittering
on
the
pond
the
silent
forests
and
towering
peaks
the
blue
sky
overhead
the
dead
trees
where
thousands
of
bats
hung
in
nauseating
clusters
thicker
than
the
leaves
in
valembrosa
and
kitten
brown
and
i
upon
our
pneumatic
raft
hands
clasped
in
pledge
of
deathless
devotion
to
science
and
a
fraternity
unending
and
how
about
that
girl
he
asked
what
girl
angelica
white
well
said
i
about
her
does
she
go
with
the
lake
or
with
the
fish
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
coldly
withdrawing
my
hand
from
his
clasp
i
mean
which
of
us
gets
the
first
chance
to
win
her
he
said
blushing
there
no
use
denying
that
we
both
have
been
bowled
over
by
her
is
there
i
pondered
for
several
moments
she
is
an
extremely
intelligent
girl
i
said
stalling
yes
and
then
some
after
a
few
minutes
further
thought
i
said
possibly
i
am
in
error
but
at
moments
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
my
marked
attentions
to
miss
white
are
not
wholly
displeasing
to
her
i
may
be
mistaken
i
think
you
are
smith
why
because
well
because
i
seem
to
think
so
i
said
coldly
because
she
happened
to
faint
away
in
your
arms
last
night
is
no
symptom
that
she
prefers
you
is
it
no
then
why
do
you
seem
to
think
that
tactful
delicate
and
assiduous
attentions
on
my
part
may
prove
not
entirely
unwelcome
to
this
unusually
intelligent
smith
what
miss
white
is
not
only
a
trained
nurse
but
she
also
is
about
to
receive
her
diploma
as
a
physician
how
do
you
know
she
told
me
when
when
you
were
building
the
fire
last
night
also
she
informed
me
that
she
had
relentlessly
dedicated
herself
to
a
eugenic
marriage
when
did
she
tell
you
while
you
were
bringing
in
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
lake
last
night
and
furthermore
she
told
me
that
was
perfectly
suited
for
a
eugenic
marriage
did
she
tell
you
i
demanded
when
she
had
fainted
in
my
arms
how
the
devil
did
she
come
to
say
a
thing
like
that
he
became
conspicuously
red
about
the
ears
well
i
had
just
told
her
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
damn
i
said
and
that
all
i
said
and
seizing
a
paddle
i
made
furiously
for
shore
behind
me
i
heard
the
whirr
of
the
piano
wire
as
brown
started
the
electric
reel
later
i
heard
him
clamping
the
hood
on
the
hydroscope
but
i
was
too
disgusted
for
any
further
words
and
i
dug
away
at
the
water
with
my
paddle
in
various
and
weird
stages
of
morning
déshabillé
the
heavy
artillery
came
down
to
the
shore
for
morning
ablutions
all
like
a
file
of
ducks
they
glared
at
me
as
i
leaped
ashore
i
want
my
breakfast
snapped
batt
do
you
hear
what
i
say
guide
and
i
do
wish
to
be
kept
waiting
for
it
either
i
desire
to
get
out
of
this
place
as
soon
as
possible
i
sorry
i
said
but
i
intend
to
stay
here
for
some
time
what
bawled
the
heavy
artillery
in
booming
unison
but
my
temper
had
been
sorely
tried
and
i
was
in
a
mood
to
tell
the
truth
and
make
short
work
of
it
too
ladies
i
said
i
not
mince
matters
brown
and
i
are
not
guides
we
are
scientists
from
bronx
park
and
we
do
know
a
bally
thing
about
this
wilderness
we
in
swindler
shouted
batt
in
an
enraged
voice
i
knew
very
well
that
the
united
states
government
would
never
have
named
that
puddle
of
water
after
do
worry
madam
i
named
it
after
brown
and
the
new
species
of
gigantic
fish
which
i
discovered
in
this
lake
i
have
named
after
myself
as
for
leaving
this
spot
until
i
have
concluded
my
scientific
study
of
these
fish
i
simply
wo
i
intend
to
observe
their
habits
and
to
capture
one
of
them
if
it
requires
the
remainder
of
my
natural
life
to
do
so
i
shall
be
sorry
to
detain
you
here
during
such
a
period
but
it
ca
be
helped
and
now
you
know
what
the
situation
is
and
you
are
at
liberty
to
think
it
over
after
you
have
washed
your
countenances
in
lake
kitten
brown
rage
possessed
the
heavy
artillery
and
a
fury
indescribable
seized
them
when
they
discovered
that
indians
had
raided
their
half
ton
of
feminine
perquisites
i
went
up
a
tree
when
the
tumult
had
calmed
sufficiently
for
them
to
distinguish
what
i
said
i
made
a
speech
to
them
from
the
higher
branches
of
a
neighboring
tree
kitten
brown
applauded
and
cried
hear
hear
ladies
i
said
you
know
the
worst
now
if
you
keep
me
up
this
tree
and
starve
me
to
death
it
will
be
murder
also
you
do
know
enough
to
get
out
of
these
forests
but
i
can
guide
you
back
the
way
you
came
do
it
if
you
cease
your
dangerous
demonstrations
and
permit
brown
and
myself
to
remain
here
and
study
these
giant
fish
for
a
week
or
two
illustration
you
keep
me
up
this
tree
and
starve
me
to
death
it
will
be
murder
they
now
seemed
disposed
to
consider
the
idea
there
was
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
so
after
an
hour
or
two
brown
and
i
ventured
to
descend
from
our
trees
and
we
went
among
them
to
placate
them
and
ingratiate
ourselves
as
best
we
might
think
i
argued
what
a
matchless
opportunity
for
you
to
be
among
the
first
discoverers
of
a
totally
new
and
undescribed
species
of
giant
fish
think
what
a
legacy
it
will
be
to
leave
such
a
record
to
posterity
think
how
proud
and
happy
your
descendants
will
be
to
know
that
their
ancestors
assisted
at
the
discovery
of
why
ca
they
be
named
after
demanded
batt
because
i
explained
patiently
they
have
already
been
named
after
could
be
named
after
me
inquired
that
fearsome
lady
the
bats
suggested
brown
politely
we
could
name
a
bat
after
you
with
pleasure
i
thought
for
a
moment
she
meant
to
swing
on
him
he
thought
so
too
and
ducked
a
bat
she
shouted
name
a
after
many
a
celebrated
scientist
has
been
honoured
by
having
his
name
conferred
upon
humbler
fauna
i
explained
but
she
remained
dangerous
so
i
went
and
built
the
fire
and
squatted
there
frying
bacon
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
sitting
side
by
side
kitten
brown
and
angelica
white
gazed
upon
each
other
with
enraptured
eyes
it
was
slightly
sickening
but
let
that
pass
i
was
beginning
to
understand
that
science
is
a
jealous
mistress
and
that
any
contemplated
infidelity
of
mine
stood
every
chance
of
being
squelched
no
evidently
i
had
not
been
fashioned
for
the
joys
of
legal
domesticity
science
the
wanton
jade
had
not
yet
finished
her
dance
with
me
apparently
my
maxixe
with
her
was
to
be
external
servanda
that
afternoon
the
heavy
artillery
held
a
council
of
war
and
evidently
came
to
a
conclusion
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
for
toward
sundown
they
accosted
me
with
a
request
for
the
raft
explaining
that
they
desired
to
picnic
aboard
and
afterward
row
about
the
lake
and
indulge
in
song
so
brown
and
i
put
aboard
the
craft
a
substantial
cold
supper
and
the
heavy
artillery
embarked
taking
aboard
a
guitar
to
be
worked
by
miss
dingleheimer
and
knitting
for
the
others
it
was
a
lovely
evening
brown
and
i
had
been
discussing
a
plan
to
dynamite
the
lake
and
stun
the
fish
that
method
appealing
to
us
as
the
only
possible
way
to
secure
a
specimen
of
the
stupendous
minnows
which
inhabited
the
depths
in
fact
it
was
our
only
hope
of
possessing
one
of
these
creatures
fishing
with
a
donkey
engine
steel
cable
and
a
hook
baited
with
a
bat
being
too
uncertain
and
far
more
laborious
and
expensive
i
was
still
smoking
my
pipe
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
big
watching
the
water
turn
from
gold
to
pink
brown
sat
higher
up
the
slope
his
arm
around
angelica
white
i
carefully
kept
my
back
toward
them
on
the
lake
the
heavy
artillery
were
revelling
loudly
banqueting
singing
strumming
the
guitar
and
trailing
their
hands
overboard
across
the
water
i
was
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
as
i
now
remember
except
that
i
noticed
the
bats
beginning
to
flit
over
the
lake
when
brown
called
to
me
from
the
slope
above
asking
whether
it
was
perfectly
safe
for
the
heavy
artillery
to
remain
out
so
late
why
i
demanded
suppose
he
shouted
that
those
fish
should
begin
to
jump
and
feed
on
the
bats
again
i
had
never
thought
of
that
i
rose
and
hurried
nervously
down
to
the
shore
and
making
a
megaphone
of
my
hands
i
shouted
come
in
it
is
safe
to
remain
out
any
longer
scornful
laughter
from
the
artillery
answered
my
appeal
you
better
come
in
i
called
you
ca
tell
what
might
happen
if
any
of
those
fish
should
jump
mind
your
business
retorted
batt
we
had
enough
of
your
prevarications
then
suddenly
without
the
faintest
shadow
of
warning
from
the
centre
of
the
lake
a
vast
geyser
of
water
towered
a
hundred
feet
in
the
air
for
one
dreadful
second
i
saw
the
raft
hurled
skyward
balanced
on
the
crest
of
the
stupendous
fountain
spilling
ladies
supper
guitars
and
knitting
in
every
direction
then
a
horrible
thing
occurred
fish
after
fish
shot
up
out
of
the
storm
of
water
and
foam
seizing
as
they
fell
ladies
luncheon
and
knitting
in
falling
back
with
a
crashing
shock
which
seemed
to
rock
the
very
mountains
illustration
then
a
horrible
thing
occurred
help
i
screamed
and
fainted
dead
away
is
it
necessary
to
proceed
literature
nods
science
shakes
her
head
no
nothing
but
literature
lies
beyond
the
ripples
which
splashed
musically
upon
the
shore
terminating
forever
the
last
vibration
from
that
immeasurable
catastrophe
why
should
i
go
on
the
newspapers
of
the
nation
have
recorded
the
last
scenes
of
the
tragedy
we
know
that
tons
of
dynamite
are
being
forwarded
to
that
solitary
lake
we
know
that
it
is
the
determination
of
the
government
to
rid
the
world
of
those
gigantic
minnows
and
yet
somehow
it
seems
to
me
as
i
sit
writing
here
in
my
office
amid
the
verdure
of
bronx
park
that
the
destruction
of
these
enormous
fish
is
a
mistake
what
more
splendid
sarcophagus
could
the
ladies
of
the
lake
desire
than
these
huge
silvery
itinerant
and
living
tombs
what
reward
more
sumptuous
could
anybody
wish
for
than
to
rest
at
last
within
the
interior
dimness
of
an
absolutely
new
species
of
anything
for
me
such
a
final
repose
as
this
would
represent
the
highest
pinnacle
of
sublimity
the
uttermost
zenith
of
mortal
dignity
so
what
more
is
there
for
me
to
say
as
for
angelica
but
no
matter
i
hope
she
may
be
comparatively
happy
with
kitten
brown
yet
as
i
have
said
before
handsome
men
never
last
but
she
should
have
thought
of
that
in
time
i
absolve
myself
of
all
responsibility
she
had
her
chance
one
over
i
professor
farrago
had
remarked
to
me
that
morning
the
city
of
new
york
always
reminds
me
of
a
slovenly
fat
woman
with
her
dress
unbuttoned
behind
i
nodded
new
york
architecture
said
i
or
what
popularly
passes
for
it
is
all
in
front
the
minute
you
get
to
the
rear
a
pitiable
condition
is
exposed
he
said
professor
jane
bottomly
is
all
façade
the
remainder
of
her
is
merely
an
occiputal
backyard
full
of
theoretical
tin
cans
and
broken
bottles
i
think
we
all
had
better
resign
it
was
a
fearsome
description
i
trembled
as
i
lighted
an
inexpensive
cigar
the
sentimental
feminist
movement
in
america
was
clearly
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottomly
affair
long
ago
in
a
reactionary
burst
of
hysteria
the
north
enfranchised
the
ethiopian
in
a
similar
sentimental
explosion
of
dementia
some
sixty
years
later
the
united
states
wept
violently
over
the
immemorial
wrongs
perpetrated
upon
the
restless
sex
opened
the
front
and
back
doors
of
opportunity
and
sobbed
out
go
to
it
ladies
they
are
still
going
professor
jane
bottomly
was
wished
on
us
out
of
a
pleasant
april
sky
she
fell
like
a
meteoric
mass
of
molten
metal
upon
the
bronx
park
zoölogical
society
splashing
her
excoriating
personality
over
everybody
until
everybody
writhed
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
lady
i
did
not
care
to
sooner
or
later
i
be
obliged
to
meet
her
but
i
was
not
impatient
now
the
field
expeditionary
force
of
the
bronx
park
zoölogical
society
is
perhaps
the
most
important
arm
of
the
service
professor
bottomly
had
just
been
appointed
official
head
of
all
field
work
why
nobody
knew
it
is
true
that
she
had
written
several
combination
nature
and
love
romances
in
these
popular
volumes
trees
flowers
butterflies
birds
animals
dialect
sobs
and
were
stirred
up
together
into
a
saccharine
mess
eagerly
gulped
down
by
a
provincial
reading
public
which
immediately
protruded
its
tongue
for
more
the
news
of
her
impending
arrival
among
us
was
an
awful
blow
to
everybody
at
the
bronx
professor
farrago
fainted
in
the
arms
of
his
pretty
stenographer
professor
cornelius
lezard
of
the
batrachian
department
ran
around
his
desk
all
day
long
in
narrowing
circles
and
was
discovered
on
his
stomach
still
feebly
squirming
like
an
expiring
top
hans
fooss
our
beloved
professor
of
pachydermatology
sat
for
hours
weeping
into
his
noodle
soup
as
for
me
i
was
both
furious
and
frightened
for
within
the
hearing
of
several
people
professor
bottomly
had
remarked
in
a
very
clear
voice
to
her
new
assistant
daisy
delmour
that
she
intended
to
get
rid
of
me
for
the
good
of
the
bronx
because
of
my
reputation
for
indiscreet
gallantry
among
the
feminine
employees
of
the
bronx
society
professor
lezard
overhead
that
outrageous
remark
and
he
hastened
to
repeat
it
to
me
i
was
lunching
at
the
time
in
my
private
office
in
the
administration
building
with
hans
fooss
he
and
i
being
too
busy
dissecting
an
unusually
fine
specimen
of
dingue
to
go
to
the
rolling
stone
inn
for
luncheon
when
professor
lezard
rushed
in
with
the
scandalous
libel
still
sizzling
in
his
ears
everybody
heard
her
say
it
he
went
on
wringing
his
hands
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
thing
for
anybody
to
say
about
you
before
all
those
young
ladies
every
stenographer
and
typewriter
there
turned
pale
and
then
red
what
i
exclaimed
conscious
that
my
own
ears
were
growing
large
and
hot
did
that
outrageous
woman
have
the
bad
taste
to
say
such
a
thing
before
all
those
sensitive
girls
she
did
she
glared
at
them
when
she
said
it
several
blondes
and
one
brunette
began
to
cry
i
hope
said
i
a
trifle
tremulously
that
no
typewriter
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
admit
noticing
playfulness
on
my
part
they
all
were
tearfully
unanimous
in
declaring
you
to
be
a
perfect
gentleman
i
am
i
said
i
am
also
a
married
man
irrevocably
wedded
to
science
i
desire
no
other
spouse
i
am
ineligible
and
everybody
knows
it
if
at
times
a
purely
scientific
curiosity
leads
me
into
a
detached
and
impersonally
psychological
investigation
of
certain
ah
feminine
idiosyncrasies
certainly
said
lezard
to
investigate
the
feminine
is
more
than
a
science
it
is
a
duty
of
a
surety
nodded
fooss
i
looked
proudly
upon
my
two
loyal
friends
and
bit
into
my
cheese
sandwich
only
men
know
men
a
jury
of
my
peers
had
exonerated
me
what
did
i
care
for
professor
bottomly
all
the
same
added
lezard
you
better
be
careful
or
professor
bottomly
will
put
one
over
on
you
yet
i
am
always
careful
i
said
with
dignity
all
men
should
be
it
is
the
only
protection
of
a
defenseless
coast
line
nodded
lezard
und
neffer
neffer

to

added
fooss

so

it
he

stein
in

he
beamed
upon
us
benevolently
over
his
knifeful
of
sauerfisch
then
he
fed
himself
and
rammed
it
down
with
a
hearty
draught
of
pilsner
we
gazed
with
reverence
upon
kultur
as
embodied
in
this
great
teuton
that
woman
remarked
lezard
to
me
certainly
means
to
get
rid
of
you
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
only
two
possible
ways
for
you
to
hold
down
your
job
at
the
bronx
you
know
it
do
you
i
nodded
yes
i
said
either
i
must
pay
marked
masculine
attention
to
professor
bottomly
or
i
must
manage
to
put
one
over
on
her
of
course
said
lezard
the
first
method
is
the
easier
for
not
for
a
minute
i
said
hastily
i
simply
could
become
frolicsome
with
her
you
say
she
got
a
voice
like
a
and
she
when
she
walks
and
i
do
mind
admitting
she
has
me
badly
scared
already
no
she
must
be
scientifically
ruined
it
is
the
only
method
which
makes
her
elimination
certain
but
if
her
popular
nature
books
did
ruin
her
scientifically
how
can
we
hope
to
lead
her
astray
inquired
lezard
there
is
i
said
thoughtfully
only
one
thing
that
can
really
ruin
a
scientist
ridicule
i
have
braved
it
many
a
time
taking
my
scientific
life
in
my
hands
in
pursuit
of
unknown
specimens
which
might
have
proved
only
imaginary
public
ridicule
would
have
ended
my
scientific
career
in
such
an
event
i
know
of
no
better
way
to
end
professor
scientific
career
and
capability
for
mischief
than
to
start
her
out
after
something
which
does
exist
inform
the
newspapers
and
let
her
suffer
the
agonising
consequences
fooss
began
to
shout
the
idea
iss
schön
colossal
prachtvol
ausgezeichnet
wunderbar
wunderschön
gemütlich
a
large
tough
noodle
checked
him
while
he
labored
with
teutonic
imperturbability
to
master
it
lezard
and
i
exchanged
suggestions
regarding
the
proposed
annihilation
of
this
fearsome
woman
who
had
come
ravening
among
us
amid
the
peaceful
and
soporific
environment
of
bronx
park
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
for
us
to
have
our
balmy
paradise
so
startlingly
invaded
by
a
large
loquacious
lady
who
had
already
stirred
us
all
out
of
our
agreeable
traditional
and
leisurely
inertia
inertia
begets
cogitation
and
cogitation
begets
ideas
and
ideas
beget
reflexion
and
profound
reflexion
is
the
fundamental
cornerstone
of
that
immortal
temple
in
which
the
goddess
science
sits
asleep
between
her
dozing
sisters
custom
and
religion
this
thought
seemed
to
me
so
unusually
beautiful
that
i
wrote
it
with
a
pencil
upon
my
cuff
while
i
was
writing
it
quietly
happy
in
the
deep
pleasure
that
my
intellectual
allegory
afforded
me
fooss
swabbed
the
last
morsel
of
nourishment
from
his
plate
with
a
wad
of
rye
bread
then
bolting
the
bread
and
wiping
his
beard
with
his
fingers
and
his
fingers
on
his
waistcoat
he
made
several
guttural
observations
too
profoundly
german
to
be
immediately
intelligible
and
lighted
his
porcelain
pipe
ach
wass
he
remarked
in
ruminative
fashion
dot
frauenzimmer
she
iss
to
raise
hell
alretty
determined
von
pachydermatology
she

nodding
maybe
she
leaves
me
alone
maybe
it
is
to
be
mit
me
i
weis
ni
it
iss
aber
besser
one
over
on
dat
lady
to
put
yess
it
certainly
is
advisable
replied
lezard
let
us
try
to
think
of
something
sufficiently
disastrous
to
terminate
her
scientific
career
said
i
and
i
bowed
my
rather
striking
head
and
rested
the
point
of
my
forefinger
upon
my
forehead
thought
crystallises
more
quickly
for
me
when
i
assume
this
attitude
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
lezard
fold
his
arms
and
sit
frowning
at
infinity
fooss
lay
back
in
a
big
deeply
padded
armchair
and
closed
his
prominent
eyes
his
pipe
went
out
presently
and
now
and
then
he
made
nasal
remarks
in
german
too
complicated
for
either
lezard
or
for
me
to
entirely
comprehend
we
must
try
to
get
her
as
far
away
from
here
as
possible
mused
lezard
is
oyster
bay
far
and
too
cruel
i
pondered
darkly
upon
the
suggestion
but
it
seemed
unpleasantly
like
murder
lezard
said
i
come
let
us
reason
together
now
is
besetting
emotion
curiosity
very
well
assuming
that
to
be
true
what
ah
quality
particularly
characterizes
woman
when
so
beset
ruthless
determination
then
said
i
we
ought
to
begin
my
exciting
the
curiosity
of
professor
bottomly
and
her
ruthless
determination
to
satisfy
that
curiosity
should
logically
follow
how
he
asked
are
we
to
arouse
her
curiosity
by
pretending
that
we
have
knowledge
of
something
hitherto
undiscovered
the
discovery
of
which
would
redound
to
our
scientific
glory
i
see
she
want
the
glory
for
herself
she
swipe
it
she
would
said
i
tee
hee
he
giggled
would
it
be
funny
to
plant
something
phony
on
her
i
waved
my
arms
rather
gracefully
in
my
excitement
that
is
the
germ
of
an
idea
i
said
if
we
could
plant
something
something
far
away
from
here
very
far
away
if
we
could
bury
something
like
the
cardiff
giant
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
away
thousands
i
insisted
enthusiastically
in
tasmania
for
example
maybe
a
tasmanian
devil
might
acquire
her
there
exists
a
gnat
said
i
in
borneo
and
when
this
tiny
gnat
stings
people
they
never
entirely
wake
up
really
rather
a
pleasurable
catastrophe
i
understand
life
becomes
one
endless
one
delightful
siesta
with
intervals
for
light
nourishment
she
ah
could
sit
very
comfortably
in
some
pleasant
retreat
and
rock
in
a
and
doze
quite
happily
through
the
years
to
come
and
from
your
description
of
her
i
should
say
that
the
soldiers
home
might
receive
her
it
wo
do
he
said
gloomily
why
is
it
too
much
like
crime
oh
not
at
all
only
if
she
went
to
borneo
she
be
sure
to
take
a
with
her
in
the
depressed
silence
which
ensued
fooss
suddenly
made
several
futurist
observations
through
his
nose
with
monotonous
but
authoritative
regularity
i
tried
to
catch
his
meaning
and
his
eye
the
one
remained
cryptic
the
other
shut
lezard
sat
thinking
very
hard
and
as
i
fidgetted
in
my
chair
fiddling
nervously
with
various
objects
lying
on
my
desk
i
chanced
to
pick
up
a
letter
from
the
pile
of
still
unopened
mail
at
my
elbow
still
pondering
on
professor
bottomly
proposed
destruction
i
turned
the
letter
over
idly
and
my
preoccupied
gaze
rested
on
the
postmark
after
a
moment
i
leaned
forward
and
examined
it
more
attentively
the
letter
directed
to
me
was
postmarked
fort
carcajou
cook
peninsula
baffin
land
and
now
i
recalled
the
handwriting
having
already
seen
it
three
or
four
times
within
the
last
month
or
so
lezard
i
said
that
lunatic
trapper
from
baffin
land
has
written
to
me
again
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
matter
with
him
is
he
just
plain
crazy
or
does
he
think
he
can
be
funny
with
me
lezard
gazed
at
me
absently
then
all
at
once
a
gleam
of
savage
interest
lighted
his
somewhat
solemn
features
read
the
letter
to
me
he
said
with
an
evil
smile
which
instantly
animated
my
own
latent
imagination
and
immediately
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
in
the
humble
letter
from
the
wilds
of
baffin
land
which
i
was
now
opening
with
eager
and
unsteady
fingers
might
lie
concealed
the
professional
undoing
of
professor
jane
bottomly
and
the
only
hope
of
my
own
ultimate
and
scientific
salvation
the
room
became
hideously
still
as
i
unfolded
the
sheets
of
cheap
ruled
letter
paper
fooss
opened
his
eyes
looked
at
me
made
porcine
sounds
indicative
of
personal
relighted
his
pipe
and
disposed
himself
to
listen
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
begin
lezard
suddenly
laid
his
forefinger
across
his
lips
conjuring
us
to
densest
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
i
heard
nothing
except
the
buzzing
of
flies
then
i
stole
a
startled
glance
at
my
door
it
was
opening
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
but
it
did
not
open
very
far
just
a
crack
remained
then
listening
with
all
our
might
we
heard
the
cautiously
suppressed
breathing
of
somebody
in
the
hallway
just
outside
of
my
door
lezard
turned
and
cast
at
me
a
glance
of
horrified
intelligence
in
dumb
pantomime
he
outlined
in
the
air
with
one
hand
the
large
and
feminine
amplification
of
his
own
person
conveying
to
us
the
certainty
of
his
suspicions
concerning
the
unseen
eavesdropper
we
nodded
we
understood
perfectly
that
was
out
there
prepared
to
listen
to
every
word
we
uttered
a
flicker
of
ferocious
joy
disturbed
lezard
otherwise
innocuous
features
he
winked
horribly
at
fooss
and
at
me
and
uttered
a
faint
click
with
his
teeth
and
tongue
like
the
snap
of
a
closing
trap
gentlemen
he
said
in
the
guarded
yet
excited
voice
of
a
man
who
is
confident
of
not
being
overheard
the
matter
under
discussion
admits
of
only
one
interpretation
a
discovery
perhaps
the
most
vitally
important
discovery
of
all
the
centuries
is
imminent
secrecy
is
imperative
the
scientific
glory
is
to
be
shared
by
us
alone
and
there
is
enough
of
glory
to
go
around
chairman
i
move
that
letter
be
read
aloud
i
second
dot
motion
said
fooss
winking
so
violently
at
me
that
his
glasses
wabbled
gentlemen
said
i
it
has
been
moved
and
seconded
that
this
letter
be
read
aloud
all
those
in
favor
will
kindly
say
aye
aye
they
exclaimed
fairly
wriggling
in
their
furtive
joy
the
will
kindly
emit
the
usual
negation
i
went
on
it
seems
to
be
carried
it
carried
the
chairman
will
proceed
to
the
reading
of
the
letter
i
quietly
lighted
a
cigar
unfolded
the

and
read
aloud

professor
dear
sir
i
already
wrote
you
three
times
no
answer
having
been
rec
perhaps
you
think
i
kiddin
you
a
dam
liar
i
ai
hoping
to
tempt
you
to
come
i
will
hereby
tell
you
i
told
you
in
my
other
letters
the
terminal
moraine
of
this
here
golden
glacier
finishes
into
a
marsh
nothing
to
see
for
miles
excep
frozen
tussock
and
mud
and
all
flat
as
hell
for
fifty
miles
which
is
where
i
am
trappin
it
for
mink
and
otter
and
now
ready
to
go
back
to
fort
carcajou
i
told
you
what
i
seen
stickin
in
under
this
here
marsh
where
anything
sticks
out
the
wolves
have
eat
it
but
most
of
them
there
ellerphants
is
in
under
the
ice
and
mud
too
far
for
the
wolves
to
git
i
ai
kiddin
you
there
is
a
whole
herd
of
furry
ellerphants
in
the
marsh
like
as
they
were
stuck
there
and
all
lay
down
and
was
drownded
like
some
has
tusks
and
some
has
two
ellerphants
stuck
out
of
the
ice
i
eat
onto
one
the
meat
was
good
and
sweet
and
joosy
the
damn
wolves
eat
it
up
that
night
i
had
cut
stakes
and
rost
for
three
months
though
and
am
eating
off
it
yet
thinking
as
how
ellerphants
and
all
like
that
is
your
graft
i
being
a
keeper
in
the
mouse
house
once
in
the
bronx
and
seein
you
around
like
you
was
full
of
scientific
thinks
it
comes
to
me
to
write
you
and
put
you
next
if
you
say
so
i
wait
here
and
help
you
with
them
ellerphants
livin

is
all
i
ask

if
you
mean
bizness
so
no
more
respectfully
james
skaw
when
i
finished
reading
i
cautiously
glanced
at
the
door
and
finding
it
still
on
the
crack
turned
and
smiled
subtly
upon
lezard
and
fooss
in
their
slowly
spreading
grins
i
saw
they
agreed
with
me
that
somebody
signing
himself
james
skaw
was
still
trying
to
hoax
the
great
zoölogical
society
of
bronx
park
gentlemen
i
said
aloud
injecting
innocent
enthusiasm
into
my
voice
this
secret
expedition
to
baffin
land
which
we
three
are
about
to
organise
is
destined
to
be
without
doubt
the
most
scientifically
prolific
field
expedition
ever
organised
by
man
imagine
an
entire
herd
of
mammoths
preserved
in
mud
and
ice
through
all
these
thousands
of
years
gentlemen
no
discovery
ever
made
has
even
remotely
approached
in
importance
the
discovery
made
by
this
simple
illiterate
trapper
james
skaw
i
thought
protested
lezard
that
are
to
be
announced
as
the
discoverers
we
are
said
i
the
discoverers
of
james
skaw
which
makes
us
technically
the
finders
of
the
herd
of
mammoths
you
understand
a
few
thousand
dollars
i
added
carelessly
ought
to
satiate
james
skaw
we
could
name
dot
glacier
after
him
suggested
fooss
certainly
the
skaw
glacier
that
ought
to
be
enough
glory
for
him
it
ought
to
satisfy
him
and
prevent
any
indiscreet
remarks
nodded
lezard
gentlemen
said
i
there
is
only
one
detail
that
really
troubles
me
ought
we
to
notify
our
honoured
and
respected
chief
of
division
concerning
this
discovery
do
you
mean
should
we
tell
that
accomplished
and
fascinating
lady
professor
bottomly
about
this
herd
of
mammoths
i
asked
in
a
loud
clear
voice
and
immediately
answered
my
own
question
no
i
said
no
dear
friends
professor
bottomly
already
has
too
much
responsibility
weighing
upon
her
distinguished
mind
no
dear
brothers
in
science
we
should
steal
away
unobserved
as
though
setting
out
upon
an
ordinary
field
expedition
and
when
we
return
with
fresh
and
immortal
laurels
such
as
no
man
before
has
ever
worn
no
doubt
that
our
chief
of
division
will
weave
for
us
further
wreaths
to
crown
our
brows
the
priceless
garlands
of
professional
approval
and
i
made
a
horrible
face
at
my
before
i
finished
lezard
had
taken
his
own
face
in
his
hands
for
the
purpose
of
stifling
raucous
and
untimely
mirth
as
for
fooss
his
small
porcine
eyes
snapped
and
twinkled
madly
behind
his
spectacles
but
he
seemed
rather
inclined
to
approve
my
flowers
of
rhetoric
ja
said
he
so

yet
again
once
more

bring
we
shall
therefore
much
praise
thereby
bekommen
ach
wass
gentlemen
said
i
distinctly
it
is
decided
then
that
we
shall
say
nothing
concerning
the
true
object
of
this
expedition
to
professor
bottomly
lezard
and
fooss
nodded
assent
then
in
the
silence
we
all
strained
our
ears
to
listen
and
presently
we
detected
the
scarcely
heard
sound
of
cautiously
retreating
footsteps
down
the
corridor
when
it
was
safe
to
do
so
i
arose
and
closed
my
door
i
think
said
i
with
a
sort
of
infernal
cheerfulness
in
my
tones
that
we
are
about
to
do
something
jocose
to
jane
bottomly
a
few
said
professor
lezard
he
rose
and
silently
executed
a
complicated
i
shall

said
fooss
earnestly
und
i
shall
laff
und
i
shall
laff
ach
gott
how
i
shall
laff
my
pally
head
off
i
folded
my
arms
and
turned
romanesquely
toward
the
direction
in
which
professor
bottomly
had
retreated
viper
i
said
the
bronx
shall
nourish
you
in
its
bosom
no
more
fade
away
ophidian
the
sentiment
was
applauded
by
all
there
chanced
to
be
in
my
desk
a
bottle
marked
that
all
on
the
label
somebody
had
written
do
it
now
we
did
iii
it
was
given
out
at
the
bronx
that
our
field
expedition
to
baffin
land
was
to
be
undertaken
solely
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
back
living
specimens
of
the
arctic
woodcock
in
order
to
add
to
our
onomatology
and
our
glossary
of
onomatopoeia
an
ontogenesis
of
this
important
but
hitherto
unstudied
i
trust
i
make
myself
clear
scientific
statements
should
be
as
clear
as
the
spuyten
duyvil
in
stagno
salus
but
two
things
immediately
occurred
which
worried
us
professor
bottomly
sent
us
official
notification
that
she
approved
our
expedition
to
baffin
land
designated
the
steamer
we
were
to
take
and
enclosed
tickets
that
scared
us
then
to
add
to
our
perplexity
professor
bottomly
disappeared
leaving
daisy
delmour
in
charge
of
her
department
during
what
she
announced
might
be
a
somewhat
prolonged
absence
on
business
and
during
the
four
feverish
weeks
of
our
pretended
preparations
for
baffin
land
not
one
word
did
we
hear
from
jane
bottomly
which
caused
us
painful
inquietude
as
the
hour
approached
for
our
departure
was
this
formidable
woman
actually
intending
to
let
us
depart
alone
for
the
golden
glacier
was
she
too
lazy
to
rob
us
of
the
secretly
contemplated
glory
which
we
had
pretended
awaited
us
we
had
been
so
absolutely
convinced
that
she
would
forbid
our
expedition
pack
us
off
elsewhere
and
take
charge
herself
of
an
exploring
party
to
baffin
land
that
as
the
time
for
our
leaving
drew
near
we
became
first
uneasy
and
then
really
alarmed
it
would
be
a
dreadful
jest
on
us
if
she
made
us
swallow
our
own
concoction
if
she
revealed
to
our
colleagues
our
pretended
knowledge
of
the
golden
glacier
and
james
skaw
and
the
supposedly
herd
of
mammoths
and
then
publicly
forced
us
to
investigate
this
hoax
more
horrible
still
would
it
be
if
she
informed
the
newspapers
and
gave
them
a
hint
to
make
merry
over
the
three
wise
men
of
the
bronx
who
went
to
baffin
land
in
a
boat
do
you
suppose
that
devious
and
secretive
female
is
up
to
inquired
lezard
who
within
the
last
few
days
had
grown
thin
with
worry
is
it
possible
that
she
is
sufficiently
degraded
to
suspect
us
of
trying
to
put
one
over
on
her
is
that
what
she
is
now
doing
to
us
it
is
the
limit
said
i
he
turned
a
morbid
eye
upon
me
she
is
making
a
monkey
of
us
what
omnia
i
nodded
sed
when
i
think
aloud
in
latin
it
means
that
i
am
deeply
troubled
quemque
scelus
do
you
get
me
professor
i
sorry
i
attempted
to
be
sportive
with
this
terrible
woman
the
curse
of
my
scientific
career
has
been
periodical
excesses
of
frivolity
see
where
this
frolicsome
impulse
has
landed
me
abyssum

she
means
to
let
us
go

fooss

i

so

it
ve

but
why
has
she
stopped
our
preparations
i
demanded
if
she
wants
all
the
glory
herself
why
does
she
permit
us
to
incur
this
expense
in
getting

no

by
a
frauenzimmer
said
fooss
wagging
his
head
the
suspense
became
we
were
obliged
to
pack
our
camping
kits
and
it
began
to
look
as
though
we
would
have
either
to
sail
the
next
morning
or
to
resign
from
the
bronx
park
zoölogical
society
because
all
the
evening
papers
had
the
story
in
big
type
the
details
and
objects
of
the
expedition
the
discovery
of
the
herd
of
mammoths
in
cold
storage
the
prompt
organization
of
an
expedition
to
secure
this
unparalleled
deposit
of
prehistoric
mammalia
everything
was
there
staring
at
us
in
violent
print
excepting
only
the
name
of
the
discoverer
and
the
names
of
those
composing
the
field
expedition
she
means
to
betray
us
after
we
have
sailed
said
lezard
greatly
depressed
we
might
just
as
well
resign
now
before
this
hoax
explodes
and
bespatters
us
we
can
take
our
chances
in
vaudeville
or
as
lecturing
professors
with
the
movies
i
thought
so
too
in
point
of
fact
we
all
had
gathered
in
my
study
to
write
out
our
resignations
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
daisy
delmour
walked
in
oddly
enough
i
had
not
before
met
delmour
personally
only
formal
written
communications
had
hitherto
passed
between
us
my
idea
of
her
had
doubtless
been
inspired
by
the
physical
and
intellectual
aberrations
of
her
chief
i
naturally
supposed
her
to
be
either
impossible
and
corporeally
redundant
or
intellectually
and
otherwise
as
weazened
as
last
year
nut
i
was
criminally
mistaken
and
why
lezard
who
knew
her
had
never
set
me
right
i
could
not
then
understand
i
comprehended
later
for
the
feminine
assistant
of
professor
jane
bottomly
who
sauntered
into
my
study
and
announced
herself
had
the
features
of
athene
the
smile
of
aphrodite
and
the
figure
of
psyche
i
believe
i
do
not
exaggerate
these
scientific
details
although
it
has
been
said
of
me
that
any
pretty
girl
distorts
my
vision
and
my
intellectual
balance
to
the
detriment
of
my
calmer
reason
and
my
differentiating
ability
gentlemen
said
delmour
while
we
stood
in
a
respectful
before
her
modestly
conscious
of
our
worth
our
toes
turned
out
and
each
man
features
wreathed
with
that
politely
unnatural
smirk
which
masculine
features
assume
when
confronted
by
feminine
beauty
gentlemen
on
the
eve
of
your
proposed
departure
for
baffin
land
in
quest
of
living
specimens
of
the
i
have
been
instructed
by
professor
bottomly
to
announce
to
you
a
great
good
fortune
for
her
for
you
for
the
bronx
for
america
for
the
entire
civilized
world
it
has
come
to
professor
bottomly
knowledge
recently
i
believe
that
an
entire
herd
of
mammoths
lie
encased
in
the
mud
and
ice
of
the
vast
flat
marshes
which
lie
south
of
the
terminal
moraine
of
the
golden
glacier
in
that
part
of
baffin
land
known
as
cook
peninsula
the
credit
of
this
discovery
is
professor
entirely
how
it
happened
she
did
not
inform
me
one
month
ago
today
she
sailed
in
great
haste
for
baffin
land
at
this
very
hour
she
is
doubtless
standing
all
alone
upon
the
frozen
surface
of
that
wondrous
marsh
contemplating
with
reverence
and
awe
and
similar
holy
emotions
the
fruits
of
her
own
unsurpassed
discovery
delmour
lovely
features
became
delicately
suffused
and
transfigured
as
she
spoke
her
exquisite
voice
thrilled
with
generous
emotion
she
clasped
her
snowy
hands
and
gazed
enraptured
at
the
picture
of
bottomly
which
her
mind
was
so
charmingly
evoking
perhaps
she
whispered
perhaps
at
this
very
instant
in
the
midst
of
that
vast
and
flat
and
solemn
desolation
the
only
protuberance
visible
for
miles
and
miles
is
professor
bottomly
perhaps
the
pallid
arctic
sun
is
setting
behind
the
majestic
figure
of
professor
bottomly
radiating
a
blinding
glory
to
the
zenith
illuminating
the
crowning
act
of
her
career
with
its
unearthly
aura
she
gazed
at
us
out
of
dimmed
and
violet
eyes
gentlemen
she
said
i
am
ordered
to
take
command
of
this
expedition
of
yours
i
am
ordered
to
sail
with
you
tomorrow
morning
on
the
labrador
and
baffin
line
steamer
the
object
of
your
expedition
therefore
is
not
to
be
the
quest
of
your
duty
now
is
to
corroborate
the
almost
miraculous
discovery
of
professor
bottomly
and
to
disinter
for
her
the
vast
herd
of
frozen
mammoths
pack
and
pickle
them
and
get
them
to
the
bronx
tomorrow
morning
papers
will
have
the
entire
story
the
credit
and
responsibility
for
the
discovery
and
the
expedition
belong
to
professor
bottomly
and
will
be
given
to
her
by
the
press
and
the
populace
of
our
great
republic
it
is
her
wish
that
no
other
names
be
mentioned
which
is
right
to
the
discoverer
belongs
the
glory
therefore
the
marsh
is
to
be
named
bottomly
marsh
and
the
glacier
bottomly
glacier
yours
and
mine
is
to
be
the
glory
of
laboring
incognito
under
the
direction
of
the
towering
scientific
intellect
of
the
age
professor
bottomly
and
the
most
precious
legacy
you
can
leave
your
children
if
you
get
married
and
have
any
is
that
you
once
wielded
the
humble
pick
and
shovel
for
jane
bottomly
on
the
bottomless
marsh
which
bears
her
name
after
a
moment
silence
we
three
men
ventured
to
look
sideways
at
each
other
we
had
certainly
killed
professor
bottomly
scientifically
speaking
the
lady
was
practically
dead
the
morning
papers
would
consummate
the
murder
we
did
know
whether
we
wanted
to
laugh
or
not
she
was
now
virtually
done
for
that
seemed
certain
so
greedily
had
this
egotistical
female
swallowed
the
silly
bait
we
offered
so
arrogantly
had
she
planned
to
eliminate
everybody
excepting
herself
from
the
credit
of
the
discovery
that
there
seemed
now
nothing
left
for
us
to
do
except
to
watch
her
hurdling
deliriously
toward
destruction
we
burst
into
hellish
laughter
we
looked
hard
at
delmour
and
we
decided
not
to
yet
said
i
to
assist
at
the
final
apotheosis
of
professor
bottomly
makes
us
very
very
happy
we
are
happy
to
remain
incognito
mere
ciphers
blotted
out
by
the
fierce
white
light
which
is
about
to
beat
upon
professor
bottomly
fore
and
aft
we
are
happy
that
our
participation
in
this
astonishing
affair
shall
never
be
known
to
science
but
happiest
of
all
are
we
dear
delmour
in
the
knowledge
that
are
to
be
with
us
and
of
us
incognito
on
this
voyage
now
imminent
that
you
are
to
be
our
revered
and
beloved
leader
and
i
for
one
promise
you
personally
the
undivided
devotion
of
a
man
whose
entire
and
austere
career
has
been
dedicated
to
science
in
its
branches
i
stepped
forward
rather
gracefully
and
raised
her
little
hand
to
my
lips
to
let
her
see
that
even
the
science
of
gallantry
had
not
been
neglected
by
me
daisy
delmour
blushed
therefore
said
i
considering
the
fact
that
our
names
are
not
to
figure
in
this
expedition
and
furthermore
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
are
going
we
shall
be
very
very
happy
to
accompany
you
dr
delmour
i
again
saluted
her
hand
and
again
delmour
blushed
and
looked
sideways
at
professor
lezard
iv
it
was
to
be
accurate
exactly
days
later
that
our
voyage
by
sea
and
land
ended
one
monday
morning
upon
the
gigantic
terminal
moraine
of
the
golden
glacier
cook
peninsula
baffin
land
four
carried
our
luggage
four
more
bore
our
persons
an
arctic
sat
on
a
bowlder
and
said
tweet
tweet
as
we
rode
out
to
the
edge
of
the
moraine
the
rising
sun
greeted
us
cordially
illuminating
below
us
the
flat
surface
of
the
marsh
which
stretched
away
to
the
east
and
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
so
flat
was
it
that
we
immediately
made
out
the
silhouettes
of
two
mules
tethered
below
us
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
something
about
the
attitude
of
these
mules
arrested
our
attention
and
gazing
upon
them
through
our
we
beheld
professor
bottomly
that
resourceful
lady
had
mounted
a
pneumatic
hammock
upon
the
two
mules
their
saddles
had
sockets
to
fit
the
legs
of
the
galvanized
iron
tripod
no
matter
in
which
way
the
mules
turned
sliding
swivels
on
the
hollow
steel
frames
regulated
the
hammock
slung
between
them
it
was
an
infernal
invention
there
lay
jane
bottomly
asleep
her
black
hair
drying
over
the
edge
gilded
to
a
peroxide
lustre
by
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
i
gazed
upon
her
with
a
sort
of
ferocious
pity
her
professional
days
were
numbered
also
had
her
number
how
majestically
she
slumbers
whispered
delmour
to
me
dreaming
doubtless
of
her
approaching
triumph
fooss
and
professor
lezard
driving
the
ahead
of
them
were
already
riding
out
across
the
marsh
daisy
i
said
leaning
from
my
saddle
and
taking
one
of
her
gloved
hands
into
mine
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
disillusion
you
there
are
no
mammoths
in
that
mud
down
there
she
looked
at
me
in
amazement
you
are
mistaken
she
said
professor
bottomly
is
celebrated
for
the
absolute
and
painstaking
accuracy
of
her
deductions
and
the
boldness
and
the
imagination
of
her
scientific
investigations
she
is
the
most
cautious
scientist
in
america
she
would
never
announce
such
a
discovery
to
the
newspapers
unless
she
were
perfectly
certain
of
its
truth
i
was
sorry
for
this
young
girl
i
pressed
her
hand
because
i
was
sorry
for
her
after
a
few
moments
of
deepest
thought
i
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
i
kissed
her
illustration
i
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
i
kissed
her
you
must
said
delmour
blushing
the
things
we
must
do
are
so
many
that
i
ca
always
remember
all
of
them
daisy
i
said
shall
we
pledge
ourselves
to
each
other
for
eternity
here
in
the
presence
of
this
immemorial
glacier
which
moves
a
thousand
inches
a
year
i
mean
an
inch
every
thousand
years
here
in
these
awful
solitudes
where
incalculable
calculations
could
not
enlighten
us
concerning
the
number
of
cubic
tons
of
mud
in
that
marsh
here
in
the
presence
of
these
innocent
mules
oh
look
exclaimed
delmour
lifting
her
flushed
cheek
from
my
shoulder
there
is
a
man
in
the
hammock
with
professor
bottomly
i
levelled
my
incredulously
good
heavens
there
a
man
there
he
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
hammock
in
a
dejected
attitude
his
booted
legs
dangling
and
as
i
gazed
i
saw
the
arm
of
professor
bottomly
raised
as
though
groping
instinctively
for
something
in
her
slumber
saw
her
fingers
close
upon
the
shirt
of
her
companion
saw
his
timid
futile
attempts
to
elude
her
saw
him
inexorably
hauled
back
and
his
head
forcibly
pillowed
upon
her
ample
chest
daisy
i
faltered
what
does
yonder
scene
of
presumable
domesticity
mean
i
i
have
the
faintest
idea
she
stammered
is
that
lady
married
or
is
this
revelry
i
asked
sternly
she
was
married
when
she
sailed
from
faltered
delmour
we
rode
forward
in
pained
silence
spurring
on
until
we
caught
up
with
lezard
and
fooss
and
the
then
we
all
pressed
ahead
a
prey
now
to
the
deepest
moral
anxiety
and
agitation
the
splashing
of
our
mule
feet
on
the
partly
melted
surface
of
the
mud
aroused
the
man
as
we
rode
up
and
he
scrambled
madly
to
get
out
of
the
hammock
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
a
detaining
feminine
hand
reached
mechanically
for
his
collar
groped
aimlessly
for
a
moment
and
fell
across
the
hammock
edge
evidently
its
owner
was
too
sleepy
for
effort
meanwhile
the
man
who
had
floundered
free
from
the
hammock
leaped
overboard
and
came
hopping
stiffly
over
the
slush
toward
us
like
a
snipe
who
are
you
i
demanded
drawing
bridle
so
suddenly
that
i
found
myself
astride
of
my
mule
ears
sliding
back
into
the
saddle
i
repeated
the
challenge
haughtily
inwardly
cursing
my
horsemanship
he
stood
balancing
his
lank
six
feet
six
of
bony
altitude
for
a
few
moments
without
replying
his
large
gentle
eyes
of
baby
blue
were
fixed
on
me
speak
i
said
the
reputation
of
a
lady
is
at
stake
who
are
you
we
ask
before
we
shoot
you
for
purpose
of
future
identification
he
gazed
at
me
wildly
i
dunno
who
i
be
he
replied
my
name
james
skaw
before
that
there
lady
went
an
changed
it
on
me
she
says
she
has
changed
my
name
to
hers
i
dunno
all
i
know

echoed
delmour
he
looked
dully
at
the
girl
then
fixed
his
large
mild
eyes
on
me
a
mission
priest
done
it
for
her
a
month
ago
when
we
was
hikin
towards
fort
carcajou

he
added
i
informed
him
with
dignity
he
blinked
at
me
at
the
others
at
the
mules
then
he
said
with
infinite
bitterness

fine
guy

hammick

her
onto
me
yaas

did
whatnhel
have
i
done
to
you
hey
we
were
dumb
he
shoved
his
hand
into
his
pocket
produced
a
slug
of
twist
slowly
gnawed
off
a
portion
and
buried
the
remains
in
his
vast
jaw
all
i
done
to
you
he
said
was
to
write
you
them
letters
sayin
as
how

that
gratitood
man

ask

a
loud
snore
from
the
hammock
startled
us
all
james
skaw
twisted
his
neck
and
looked
warily
at
the
hammock
then
turning
toward
me
aw
he
said
she

them

job

we
camped
there
an
slep
for
two
days
without
wakin
when
i
waked
up
i
was
convalescent
she
was
good
to
me
she
made

an
she
wrapped

until
i
was
well
enough
to
endoor
it
an
she
brooke
the
nooze
to
me
that
we
was
married
an
that
she
had
went
as
far
as
to
marry
me
in
the
sacred
cause
of
science
because
man
an
wife
is
one
an
what
i
knowed
about
them
ellerphants
she
now
had
a
right
to
know
sir
she
had
put
one
over
on
me
so
bein
strickly
hones
i
had
to
show
her
where
them
ellerphants
lay
froze
up
under
the
marsh
v
where
the
ambition
of
this
infatuated
woman
had
led
her
appalled
us
all
the
personal
sacrifice
she
had
made
in
the
name
of
science
awed
us
still
when
i
remembered
that
detaining
arm
sleepily
lifted
from
the
nuptual
hammock
i
was
not
so
certain
concerning
her
continued
martyrdom
i
cast
an
involuntary
glance
of
critical
appraisal
upon
james
skaw
he
had
the
golden
hair
and
beard
of
the
early
christian
martyr
his
features
were
classically
regular
he
stood
six
feet
six
he
was
lean
because
fit
sound
as
a
hound
tooth
and
really
a
superb
specimen
of
masculine
health
curry
him
and
trim
him
and
clothe
him
in
evening
dress
and
his
physical
appearance
would
make
a
sensation
at
the
court
of
james
only
his
english
required
manicuring
the
longer
i
looked
at
him
the
better
i
comprehended
that
detaining
hand
from
the
hammock
indulcet
then
with
a
shock
it
rushed
over
me
that
there
evidently
had
been
some
ground
for
this
man
letters
to
me
concerning
a
herd
of
frozen
mammoths
professor
bottomly
had
not
only
married
him
to
obtain
the
information
but
here
she
was
still
camping
on
the
marsh
james
skaw
i
said
tremulously
where
are
those
mammoths
he
looked
at
me
then
made
a
vague
gesture
under
the
mud
everywhere
all
around
us
has
seen
them
yes
i
showed
her
about
a
hundred
there
one
under
you
look
you
can
see
him
through
the
slush
ach
gott
burst
from
fooss
and
he
tottered
in
his
saddle
lezard
frightfully
pale
passed
a
shaking
hand
over
his
brow
as
for
me
my
hair
became
dank
with
misery
for
there
directly
under
my
feet
the
vast
hairy
bulk
of
a
mammoth
lay
dimly
visible
through
the
muddy
ice
what
i
had
done
to
myself
when
i
was
planning
to
do
professor
bottomly
suddenly
burst
upon
me
in
all
its
hideous
proportions
fame
the
plaudits
of
the
world
the
highest
scientific
honours
all
these
in
my
effort
to
annihilate
her
i
had
deliberately
thrust
upon
this
woman
to
my
own
everlasting
detriment
and
disgrace
a
sort
of
howl
escaped
from
fooss
who
had
dismounted
and
who
had
been
scratching
in
the
slush
with
his
feet
like
a
hen
for
already
this
slight
gallinaceous
effort
of
his
had
laid
bare
a
hairy
section
of
frozen
mammoth
lezard
weeping
bitterly
squatted
beside
him
clawing
at
the
thin
skin
of
ice
with
a
it
seemed
more
than
i
could
bear
and
i
flung
myself
from
my
mule
and
seizing
a
spade
fell
violently
to
work
the
tears
of
rage
and
mortification
coursing
down
my
cheeks
hurrah
cried
delmour
excitedly
scrambling
down
from
her
mule
and
lifting
a
box
of
dynamite
from
her
transfigured
with
enthusiasm
she
seized
a
crowbar
traced
in
the
slush
the
huge
outlines
of
the
buried
beast
then
measuring
with
practiced
eye
the
irregular
zone
of
cleavage
she
marked
out
a
vast
oval
dug
holes
along
it
with
her
bar
dropped
into
each
hole
a
stick
of
dynamite
got
out
the
batteries
and
wires
attached
the
fuses
covered
each
charge
and
retired
on
a
run
toward
the
moraine
unreeling
wire
as
she
sped
upward
among
the
bowlders
half
frantic
with
grief
and
half
mad
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
we
still
had
sense
enough
to
shoulder
our
tools
and
drive
our
mules
back
across
the
moraine
only
the
in
which
reposed
professor
bottomly
remained
on
the
marsh
for
one
horrid
instant
temptation
assailed
me
to
press
the
button
before
james
skaw
could
lead
the
up
to
the
moraine
it
was
my
closest
approach
to
crime
with
a
shudder
i
viewed
the
approach
of
the
mules
james
skaw
led
them
by
the
head
the
hammock
on
its
bar
and
swivels
swung
gently
between
them
professor
bottomly
slept
lulled
no
doubt
to
deeper
slumber
by
the
gently
swaying
hammock
when
the
hammock
came
up
one
by
one
we
gazed
upon
its
unconscious
occupant
and
even
amid
dark
and
revengeful
thoughts
amid
a
mental
chaos
of
grief
and
fury
and
frantic
i
had
to
admit
to
myself
that
jane
bottomly
was
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
and
too
and
that
her
hair
was
all
her
own
and
almost
magnificent
at
that
with
a
modiste
to
advise
her
a
maid
to
dress
her
i
myself
might
have
but
let
that
pass
only
as
i
gazed
upon
her
fresh
complexion
and
the
softly
parted
red
lips
of
professor
bottomly
and
as
i
noted
the
beautiful
white
throat
and
prettily
shaped
hands
a
newer
bitterer
and
more
overwhelming
despair
seized
me
and
i
realized
now
that
perhaps
i
had
thrown
away
more
than
fame
honours
applause
i
had
perhaps
thrown
away
love
at
that
moment
professor
bottomly
awoke
for
a
moment
her
eyes
had
a
dazed
expression
then
they
widened
and
she
lay
very
quietly
looking
from
one
to
another
of
us
cradled
in
the
golden
glory
of
her
hair
perfectly
mistress
of
herself
and
her
mind
as
clear
as
a
bell
well
she
said
so
you
have
arrived
at
last
and
to
delmour
she
smilingly
extended
a
cool
fresh
hand
have
you
met
my
husband
she
inquired
we
admitted
that
we
had
james
she
called
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
james
skaw
hopped
nimbly
to
do
her
bidding
a
tender
smile
came
into
her
face
as
she
gazed
upon
her
husband
she
made
no
explanation
concerning
him
no
apology
for
him
and
watching
her
it
slowly
filtered
into
my
mind
that
she
liked
him
with
one
hand
in
her
husband
and
one
on
delmour
arm
she
listened
to
daisy
account
of
what
we
were
about
to
do
to
the
imbedded
mammoth
and
nodded
approval
james
skaw
turned
the
mules
so
that
she
might
watch
the
explosion
she
twisted
up
her
hair
then
sat
up
in
her
hammock
daisy
delmour
pressed
the
electric
button
there
came
a
deep
jarring
sound
a
vast
upheaval
and
up
out
of
the
mud
rose
or
six
dozen
and
toppled
gently
over
upon
the
surface
of
the
ice
illustration
out
of
the
mud
rose
or
six
dozen
miserable
as
we
were
at
such
an
astonishing
spectacle
we
raised
a
tragic
cheer
as
professor
bottomly
sprang
out
of
her
hammock
and
telling
delmour
to
get
a
camera
seized
her
husband
and
sped
down
to
where
one
of
the
great
hairy
frozen
beasts
lay
on
the
ice
in
full
sunshine
and
then
we
tasted
the
last
drop
of
gall
which
our
cup
of
bitterness
held
for
us
professor
bottomly
climbed
up
the
sides
of
the
frozen
mammoth
dragging
her
husband
with
her
and
stood
there
waving
a
little
american
flag
while
delmour
used
up
every
film
in
the
camera
to
record
the
scientific
triumph
of
the
ages
illustration
delmour
used
up
every
film
in
the
camera
to
record
the
scientific
triumph
of
the
ages
almost
idiotic
with
the
shock
of
my
great
grief
i
reeled
and
tottered
away
among
the
bowlders
fooss
came
to
find
me
and
when
he
found
me
he
kicked
me
violently
for
some
time
esel
dumkopf
he
said
when
he
was
tired
lezard
came
and
fell
upon
me
showering
me
with
kicks
and
anathema
when
he
went
away
i
beat
my
head
with
my
fists
for
a
while
every
little
helped
after
a
time
i
smelled
cooking
and
presently
delmour
came
to
where
i
sat
huddled
up
miserably
in
the
sun
behind
the
bowlder
luncheon
is
ready
she
said
i
groaned
do
you
feel
well
i
said
that
i
did
not
she
lingered
apparently
with
the
idea
of
cheering
me
up
it
been
such
fun
she
said
professor
lezard
and
i
have
already
located
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
mammoths
within
a
short
distance
of
here
and
apparently
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands
more
in
the
vicinity
the
ivory
alone
is
worth
over
a
million
dollars
is
it
wonderful
she
laughed
excitedly
and
danced
away
to
join
the
others
then
out
of
the
black
depth
of
my
misery
a
feeble
gleam
illuminated
the
stygian
obscurity
there
was
one
way
left
to
stay
my
approaching
downfall
only
one
professor
bottomly
meant
to
get
rid
of
me
for
the
good
of
the
bronx
but
there
remained
a
way
to
ward
off
impending
disaster
and
though
i
had
lost
the
opportunity
of
my
life
by
disbelieving
the
simple
honesty
of
james
skaw
and
though
the
honors
and
emoluments
and
applause
which
ought
to
have
been
mine
were
destined
for
this
determined
woman
still
if
i
kept
my
head
i
should
be
able
to
hold
my
job
at
the
bronx
delmour
was
immovable
in
the
good
graces
of
professor
bottomly
and
the
only
way
for
me
to
retain
my
position
was
to
marry
her
the
thought
comforted
me
after
a
while
i
felt
well
enough
to
arise
and
partake
of
some
luncheon
they
were
all
seated
around
the
campfire
when
i
approached
i
was
welcomed
politely
inquiries
concerning
my
health
were
offered
but
the
coldly
malevolent
glare
of
fooss
and
the
calm
contempt
in
gaze
chilled
me
and
i
squatted
down
by
daisy
delmour
and
accepted
a
dish
of
soup
from
her
in
mortified
silence
professor
bottomly
and
james
skaw
were
feasting
connubially
side
by
side
and
she
was
selecting
titbits
for
him
which
he
dutifully
swallowed
his
large
mild
eyes
gazing
at
vacancy
in
a
gentle
surprised
sort
of
way
as
he
gulped
down
what
she
offered
him
neither
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
anybody
else
fooss
gobbled
his
lunch
in
a
sort
of
raging
silence
lezard
on
the
other
side
of
delmour
conversed
with
her
continually
in
undertones
after
a
while
his
persistent
murmuring
began
to
make
me
uneasy
even
suspicious
and
i
glared
at
him
sideways
daisy
delmour
catching
my
eye
blushed
hesitated
then
leaning
over
toward
me
with
delightful
confusion
she
whispered
i
know
that
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
have
just
promised
to
marry
your
closest
friend
professor
lezard
what
i
shouted
with
all
my
might
have
put
one
over
on
me
too
lezard
and
fooss
seized
me
for
i
had
risen
and
was
jumping
up
and
down
and
splashing
them
with
soup
everybody
has
put
one
over
on
me
i
shrieked
everybody
now
i
going
to
put
one
over
on
myself
illustration
has
put
one
over
on
me
i
shrieked
and
i
lifted
my
plate
of
soup
and
reversed
it
on
my
head
they
told
me
later
that
i
screamed
for
half
an
hour
before
i
swooned
afterward
my
intellect
being
impaired
instead
of
being
dismissed
from
my
department
i
was
promoted
to
the
position
which
i
now
hold
as
president
emeritus
of
the
consolidated
art
museums
and
zoölogical
gardens
of
the
city
of
new
york
i
have
easy
hours
little
to
do
and
twenty
ornamental
stenographers
and
typewriters
engaged
upon
my
memoirs
which
i
dictate
when
i
feel
like
it
steeped
in
the
aroma
of
the
most
inexpensive
cigar
i
can
buy
at
the
rolling
stone
inn
there
is
one
typist
in
particular
but
let
that
pass
sapit
qui
pauca
un
peu
when
i
returned
to
the
plateau
from
my
investigation
of
the
crater
i
realized
that
i
had
descended
the
grassy
pit
as
far
as
any
human
being
could
descend
no
living
creature
could
pass
that
barrier
of
flame
and
vapour
of
that
i
was
convinced
now
not
only
the
crater
but
its
steaming
effluvia
was
utterly
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
before
beheld
there
was
no
trace
of
lava
to
be
seen
or
of
pumice
ashes
or
of
volcanic
rejecta
in
any
form
whatever
there
were
no
sulphuric
odours
no
pungent
fumes
nothing
to
teach
the
olfactory
nerves
what
might
be
the
nature
of
the
silvery
steam
rising
from
the
crater
incessantly
in
a
vast
circle
ringing
its
circumference
halfway
down
the
slope
under
this
thin
curtain
of
steam
a
ring
of
pale
yellow
flames
played
and
sparkled
completely
encircling
the
slope
the
crater
was
about
half
a
mile
deep
the
sides
sloped
gently
to
the
bottom
but
the
odd
feature
of
the
entire
phenomenon
was
this
the
bottom
of
the
crater
seemed
to
be
entirely
free
from
fire
and
vapour
it
was
sandy
and
flat
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
diameter
through
my
i
could
see
patches
of
grass
and
wild
flowers
growing
in
the
sand
here
and
there
and
the
sparkle
of
water
and
a
crow
or
two
feeding
and
walking
about
i
looked
at
the
girl
who
was
standing
beside
me
then
cast
a
glance
around
at
the
very
unusual
landscape
we
were
standing
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
some
two
thousand
feet
high
looking
into
a
depression
or
crater
on
the
edges
of
which
we
stood
this
low
mountain
as
i
say
was
grassy
and
quite
treeless
although
it
rose
like
a
truncated
out
of
a
wilderness
of
trees
which
stretched
for
miles
below
us
north
south
east
and
west
bordered
on
the
horizon
by
towering
blue
mountains
their
distant
ranges
enclosing
the
forests
as
in
a
vast
amphitheatre
from
the
centre
of
this
enormous
green
floor
of
foliage
rose
our
grassy
hill
and
it
appeared
to
be
the
only
irregularity
which
broke
the
level
wilderness
as
far
as
the
base
of
the
dim
blue
ranges
encircling
the
horizon
except
for
the
log
bungalow
of
blythe
on
the
eastern
edge
of
this
grassy
plateau
there
was
not
a
human
habitation
in
sight
nor
a
trace
of
man
devastating
presence
in
the
wilderness
around
us
again
i
looked
questioningly
at
the
girl
beside
me
and
she
looked
back
at
me
rather
seriously
shall
we
seat
ourselves
here
in
the
sun
she
asked
i
nodded
very
gravely
we
settled
down
side
by
side
on
the
thick
green
grass
now
she
said
i
shall
tell
you
why
i
wrote
you
to
come
out
here
shall
i
by
all
means
miss
blythe
sitting
she
gathered
her
ankles
into
her
hands
settling
herself
as
snugly
on
the
grass
as
a
bird
settles
on
its
nest
the
phenomena
of
nature
she
said
have
always
interested
me
intensely
not
only
from
the
artistic
angle
but
from
the
scientific
point
of
view
it
is
different
with
father
he
is
a
painter
he
cares
only
for
the
artistic
aspects
of
nature
phenomena
of
a
scientific
nature
bore
him
also
you
may
have
noticed
that
he
is
of
a
a
slightly
impatient
disposition
i
had
noticed
it
he
had
been
anything
but
civil
to
me
when
i
arrived
the
night
before
after
a
mile
trip
on
a
mule
from
the
nearest
railroad
a
journey
performed
entirely
alone
and
by
compass
there
being
no
trail
after
the
first
fifty
miles
to
characterize
blythe
as
slightly
impatient
was
letting
him
down
easy
he
was
a
selfish
old
pig
yes
i
said
answering
her
i
did
notice
a
negligible
trace
of
impatience
about
your
father
she
flushed
you
see
i
did
not
inform
my
father
that
i
had
written
to
you
he
like
strangers
he
does
like
scientists
i
did
not
dare
tell
him
that
i
had
asked
you
to
come
out
here
it
was
entirely
my
own
idea
i
felt
that
i
write
you
because
i
am
positive
that
what
is
happening
in
this
wilderness
is
of
vital
scientific
importance
how
did
you
get
a
letter
out
of
this
distant
and
desolate
place
i
asked
every
two
months
the
storekeeper
at
windflower
station
sends
in
a
man
and
a
string
of
mules
with
staples
for
us
the
man
takes
our
further
orders
and
our
letters
back
to
civilization
i
nodded
he
took
my
letter
to
you
among
one
or
two
others
i
sent
a
charming
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
she
was
really
extremely
pretty
i
liked
that
girl
when
a
girl
blushes
when
she
speaks
to
a
man
he
immediately
accepts
her
heightened
colour
as
a
personal
tribute
this
is
not
vanity
it
is
merely
a
proper
sense
of
personal
worthiness
she
said
thoughtfully
the
mail
bag
which
that
man
brought
to
us
last
week
contained
a
letter
which
had
i
received
it
earlier
would
have
made
my
invitation
to
you
unnecessary
i
sorry
i
disturbed
you
am
not
said
i
looking
into
her
beautiful
eyes
i
twisted
my
mustache
into
two
attractive
points
shot
my
cuffs
and
glanced
at
her
again
receptively
she
had
a
expression
in
her
eyes
i
straightened
my
necktie
a
man
without
being
vain
ought
to
be
conscious
of
his
own
worth
and
now
she
continued
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
various
reasons
why
i
asked
so
celebrated
a
scientist
as
yourself
to
come
here
i
thanked
her
for
her
encomium
ever
since
my
father
retired
from
boston
to
purchase
this
hill
and
the
wilderness
surrounding
it
she
went
on
ever
since
he
came
here
to
live
a
hermit
life
a
life
devoted
solely
to
painting
landscapes
i
also
have
lived
here
all
alone
with
him
that
is
three
years
now
and
from
the
very
beginning
from
the
very
first
day
of
our
arrival
somehow
or
other
i
was
conscious
that
there
was
something
abnormal
about
this
corner
of
the
world
she
bent
forward
lowering
her
voice
a
trifle
have
you
noticed
she
asked
that
so
many
things
seem
to
be
out
here
circular
i
repeated
surprised
yes
that
crater
is
circular
so
is
the
bottom
of
it
so
is
this
plateau
and
the
hill
and
the
forests
surrounding
us
and
the
mountain
ranges
on
the
horizon
but
all
this
is
natural
perhaps
but
in
those
woods
down
there
there
are
here
and
there
great
circles
of
crumbling
soil
circles
a
mile
in
diameter
mounds
built
by
prehistoric
man
no
doubt
she
shook
her
head
these
are
not
prehistoric
mounds
why
not
because
they
have
been
freshly
made
how
do
you
know
the
earth
is
freshly
upheaved
great
trees
partly
uprooted
slant
at
every
angle
from
the
sides
of
the
enormous
piles
of
newly
upturned
earth
sand
and
stones
are
still
sliding
from
the
raw
ridges
she
leaned
nearer
and
dropped
her
voice
still
lower
more
than
that
she
said
my
father
and
i
both
have
seen
one
of
these
huge
circles
the
what
i
exclaimed
incredulously
it
is
true
we
have
seen
several
and
it
enrages
father
enrages
yes
because
it
upsets
the
trees
where
he
is
painting
landscapes
and
tilts
them
in
every
direction
which
of
course
ruins
his
picture
and
he
is
obliged
to
start
another
which
vexes
him
dreadfully
i
think
i
must
have
gaped
at
her
in
sheer
astonishment
but
there
is
something
more
singular
than
that
for
you
to
investigate
she
said
calmly
look
down
at
that
circle
of
steam
which
makes
a
perfect
ring
around
the
bowl
of
the
crater
halfway
down
do
you
see
the
flicker
of
fire
under
the
vapour
yes
she
leaned
so
near
and
spoke
in
such
a
low
voice
that
her
fragrant
breath
fell
upon
my
cheek
in
the
fire
under
the
vapours
there
are
little
animals
what
little
beasts
live
in
the
fire
slim
furry
creatures
smaller
than
a
weasel
i
seen
them
peep
out
of
the
fire
and
scurry
back
into
it
are
you
sorry
that
i
wrote
you
to
come
and
will
you
forgive
me
for
bringing
you
out
here
an
indescribable
excitement
seized
me
endowing
me
with
a
fluency
and
eloquence
unusual
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
cried
from
the
depths
of
a
heart
the
emotions
of
which
are
entirely
and
exclusively
of
scientific
origin
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
held
out
my
hand
she
laid
hers
in
it
with
charming
diffidence
yours
is
the
discovery
i
said
yours
shall
be
the
glory
fame
shall
crown
you
and
perhaps
if
there
remains
any
reflected
light
in
the
form
of
a
some
modest
and
negligible
little
ray
may
chance
to
illuminate
me
surprised
and
deeply
moved
by
my
eloquence
i
bent
over
her
hand
and
saluted
it
with
my
lips
she
thanked
me
her
pretty
face
was
rosy
it
appeared
that
she
had
three
cows
to
milk
eggs
to
gather
and
the
construction
of
some
fresh
butter
to
be
accomplished
at
the
bars
of
the
grassy
pasture
slope
she
dropped
me
a
curtsey
declining
very
shyly
to
let
me
carry
her
lacteal
paraphernalia
so
i
continued
on
to
the
bungalow
garden
where
blythe
sat
on
a
camp
stool
under
a
green
umbrella
painting
a
picture
of
something
or
other
mr
blythe
i
cried
striving
to
subdue
my
enthusiasm
the
eyes
of
the
scientific
world
are
now
open
upon
this
house
the
searchlight
of
fame
is
about
to
be
turned
upon
you
i
prefer
privacy
he
interrupted
that
why
i
came
here
i
be
obliged
if
you
turn
off
that
searchlight
but
my
dear
blythe
i
want
to
be
let
alone
he
repeated
irritably
i
came
out
here
to
paint
and
to
enjoy
privately
my
own
paintings
if
what
stood
on
his
easel
was
a
sample
of
his
pictures
nobody
was
likely
to
share
his
enjoyment
your
work
said
i
politely
is
is
is
what
he
snapped
is
it
if
you
think
you
know
it
is
entirely
so
to
speak
by
itself
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
that
i
looked
at
his
picture
appalled
the
entire
canvas
was
one
monotonous
vermillion
conflagration
i
examined
it
with
my
head
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
side
i
made
a
funnel
with
both
hands
and
peered
intently
through
it
at
the
picture
a
menacing
murmuring
sound
came
from
him
satisfying
exquisitely
satisfying
i
concluded
i
have
often
seen
such
sunsets
what
i
mean
such
prairie
fires
damnation
he
exclaimed
i
painting
a
bowl
of
nasturtiums
i
was
speaking
purely
in
metaphor
said
i
with
a
sickly
smile
to
me
a
nasturtium
by
the
river
brink
is
more
than
a
simple
flower
it
is
a
broader
grander
more
magnificent
more
stupendous
symbol
it
may
mean
anything
everything
such
as
sunsets
and
conflagrations
and
götterdämmerungs
or
and
my
voice
was
subtly
modulated
to
an
appealing
and
persuasive
softness
it
may
mean
nothing
at
all
chaos
void
vacuum
negation
the
exquisite
annihilation
of
what
has
never
even
existed
he
glared
at
me
over
his
shoulder
if
he
was
infected
by
cubist
tendencies
he
evidently
had
not
understood
what
i
said
if
you
wo
talk
about
my
pictures
i
do
mind
your
investigating
this
district
he
grunted
dabbing
at
his
palette
and
plastering
a
wad
of
vermilion
upon
his
canvas
but
i
object
to
any
public
invasion
of
my
artistic
privacy
until
i
am
ready
for
it
when
will
that
be
he
pointed
with
one
brush
toward
a
long
low
log
building
in
that
structure
he
said
are
packed
one
thousand
and
paintings
all
signed
by
me
i
have
executed
one
or
two
every
day
since
i
came
here
when
i
have
painted
exactly
ten
thousand
pictures
no
more
no
less
i
shall
erect
here
a
gallery
large
enough
to
contain
them
all
only
real
lovers
of
art
will
ever
come
here
to
study
them
it
is
five
hundred
miles
from
the
railroad
therefore
i
shall
never
have
to
endure
the
praises
of
the
dilettante
the
patronage
of
the
idler
the
vapid
rhapsodies
of
the
vulgar
only
those
who
understand
will
care
to
make
the
pilgrimage
he
waved
his
brushes
at
me
the
conservation
of
national
resources
is
all
well
enough
the
setting
aside
of
timber
reserves
game
preserves
bird
refuges
all
these
projects
are
very
good
in
a
way
but
i
have
dedicated
this
wilderness
as
a
last
and
only
refuge
in
all
the
world
for
true
art
because
true
art
except
for
my
pictures
is
i
believe
now
practically
extinct
you
in
my
way
would
you
mind
getting
out
i
had
sidled
around
between
him
and
his
bowl
of
nasturtiums
and
i
hastily
stepped
aside
he
squinted
at
the
flowers
mixed
up
a
flamboyant
mess
of
colour
on
his
palette
and
daubed
away
with
unfeigned
satisfaction
no
longer
noticing
me
until
i
started
to
go
then
what
is
it
you
here
for
anyway
he
demanded
abruptly
i
said
with
dignity
i
am
here
to
investigate
those
huge
rings
of
earth
thrown
up
in
the
forest
as
by
a
gigantic
mole
he
continued
to
paint
for
a
few
moments
well
go
and
investigate
he
snapped
i
not
infatuated
with
your
society
what
do
you
think
they
are
i
asked
mildly
ignoring
his
wretched
manners
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
except
that
sometimes
when
i
begin
to
paint
several
trees
the
very
trees
i
painting
are
suddenly
heaved
up
and
tilted
in
every
direction
and
all
my
work
goes
for
nothing
makes
me
mad
otherwise
the
matter
has
no
interest
for
me
but
what
in
the
world
could
cause
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
he
shouted
waving
palette
and
brushes
angrily
maybe
it
an
army
of
moles
working
all
together
under
the
ground
maybe
it
some
species
of
circular
earthquake
i
do
know
i
do
care
but
it
annoys
me
and
if
you
can
devise
any
scientific
means
to
stop
it
i
be
much
obliged
to
you
otherwise
to
be
perfectly
frank
you
bore
me
the
mission
of
science
said
i
solemnly
is
to
alleviate
the
inconveniences
of
mundane
existence
science
therefore
shall
extend
a
helping
hand
to
her
frailer
sister
art
science
ca
patronize
art
while
i
around
he
retorted
i
have
it
but
my
dear
blythe
i
wo
dispute
with
you
either
i
do
like
to
dispute
he
shouted
do
try
to
make
me
do
attempt
to
inveigle
me
into
discussion
i
know
all
i
want
to
know
i
do
want
to
know
anything
you
want
me
to
know
either
i
looked
at
the
old
pig
in
haughty
silence
nauseated
by
his
conceit
after
he
had
plastered
a
few
more
tubes
of
vermilion
over
his
canvas
he
quieted
down
and
presently
gave
me
an
oblique
glance
over
his
shoulder
well
he
said
what
else
are
you
intending
to
investigate
those
little
animals
that
live
in
the
crater
fires
i
said
bluntly
yes
he
nodded
indifferently
there
are
creatures
which
live
somewhere
in
the
fires
of
that
crater
do
you
realize
what
an
astounding
statement
you
are
making
i
asked
it
does
astound
what
do
i
care
whether
it
astounds
you
or
anybody
else
nothing
interests
me
except
art
but
i
tell
you
nothing
interests
me
except
art
he
yelled
do
dispute
it
do
answer
me
do
irritate
me
i
do
care
whether
anything
lives
in
the
fire
or
not
let
it
live
there
but
have
you
actually
seen
live
creatures
in
the
flames
plenty
what
of
it
what
about
it
let
live
there
for
all
i
care
i
painted
pictures
of
too
that
all
that
interests
me
what
do
they
look
like
mr
blythe
look
like
do
know
they
look
like
weasels
or
rats
or
bats
or
cats
or
stop
asking
me
questions
it
irritates
me
it
depresses
me
do
ask
any
more
why
do
you
go
in
to
lunch
and
tell
my
daughter
to
bring
me
a
bowl
of
salad
out
here
no
time
to
stuff
myself
some
people
have
have
you
better
go
in
to
lunch
and
tell
my
daughter
to
bring
me
seven
tubes
of
chinese
vermilion
with
my
salad
you
do
mean
to
mix
i
began
then
checked
myself
before
his
fury
i
rather
eat
vermilion
paint
on
my
salad
than
sit
here
talking
to
he
shouted
i
cast
a
pitying
glance
at
this
impossible
man
and
went
into
the
house
after
all
he
was
father
i
to
endure
him
after
miss
blythe
had
carried
to
her
father
a
large
bucket
of
lettuce
leaves
she
returned
to
the
veranda
of
the
bungalow
illustration
miss
blythe
had
carried
to
her
father
a
large
bucket
of
lettuce
leaves
a
delightful
luncheon
awaited
us
i
seated
her
then
took
the
chair
opposite
a
delicious
omelette
fresh
biscuit
salad
and
strawberry
preserves
and
a
tall
tumbler
of
iced
tea
imbued
me
with
a
sort
of
mild
exhilaration
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
blythe
down
in
the
garden
munching
his
lettuce
leaves
like
an
rabbit
and
daubing
away
at
his
picture
while
he
munched
your
father
said
i
politely
is
something
of
a
genius
i
am
so
glad
you
think
so
she
said
gratefully
but
do
tell
him
so
he
has
been
surfeited
with
praise
in
boston
that
is
why
we
came
out
here
art
said
i
is
like
science
or
tobacco
or
every
man
to
his
own
brand
personally
i
do
care
for
his
kind
but
who
can
say
which
is
the
best
kind
of
anything
only
the
consumer
your
father
is
his
own
consumer
he
is
the
best
judge
of
what
he
likes
and
that
is
the
only
true
test
of
art
or
anything
else
how
delightfully
you
reason
she
said
how
logically
how
generously
reason
is
the
handmaid
of
science
miss
blythe
she
seemed
to
understand
me
her
quick
intelligence
surprised
me
because
i
myself
was
not
perfectly
sure
whether
i
had
emitted
piffle
or
an
epigram
as
we
ate
our
strawberry
preserves
we
discussed
ways
and
means
of
capturing
a
specimen
of
the
little
fire
creatures
which
as
she
explained
so
frequently
peeped
out
at
her
from
the
crater
fires
and
at
her
slightest
movement
scurried
back
again
into
the
flames
of
course
i
believed
that
this
was
only
her
imagination
yet
for
years
i
had
entertained
a
theory
that
fire
supported
certain
unknown
forms
of
life
i
have
long
believed
said
i
that
fire
is
inhabited
by
living
organisms
which
require
the
elements
and
temperature
of
active
combustion
for
their
existence
microörganisms
but
not
i
added
smilingly
any
higher
type
of
life
in
the
fireplace
she
ventured
diffidently
i
sometimes
see
curious
things
dragons
and
snakes
and
creatures
of
grotesque
and
peculiar
shapes
i
smiled
indulgently
charmed
by
this
innocently
offered
contribution
to
science
then
she
rose
and
i
rose
and
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
we
wandered
over
the
grass
toward
the
crater
while
i
explained
to
her
the
difference
between
what
we
imagine
we
see
in
the
glowing
coals
of
a
grate
fire
and
my
own
theory
that
fire
is
the
abode
of
living
animalculae
on
the
grassy
edge
of
the
crater
we
paused
and
looked
down
the
slope
where
the
circle
of
steam
rose
partly
veiling
the
pale
flash
of
fire
underneath
how
near
can
we
go
i
inquired
quite
near
come
i
guide
you
leading
me
by
the
hand
she
stepped
over
the
brink
and
we
began
to
descend
the
easy
grass
slope
together
there
was
no
difficulty
about
it
at
all
down
we
went
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
wall
of
steam
until
at
last
when
but
fifteen
feet
away
from
it
i
felt
the
heat
from
the
flames
which
sparkled
below
the
wall
of
vapour
here
we
seated
ourselves
upon
the
grass
and
i
knitted
my
brows
and
fixed
my
eyes
upon
this
curious
phenomenon
striving
to
discover
some
reason
for
it
except
for
the
vapour
and
the
fires
there
was
nothing
whatever
volcanic
about
this
spectacle
or
in
the
surroundings
from
where
i
sat
i
could
see
that
the
bed
of
fire
which
encircled
the
crater
and
the
wall
of
vapour
which
crowned
the
flames
were
about
three
hundred
feet
wide
of
course
this
barrier
was
absolutely
impassable
there
was
no
way
of
getting
through
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
crater
a
slight
pressure
from
miss
blythe
fingers
engaged
my
attention
i
turned
toward
her
and
she
said
there
is
one
more
thing
about
which
i
have
not
told
you
i
feel
a
little
guilty
because
is
the
real
reason
i
asked
you
to
come
here
what
is
it
i
think
there
are
emeralds
on
the
floor
of
that
crater
emeralds
i
so
she
felt
in
the
ruffled
pocket
of
her
apron
drew
out
a
fragment
of
mineral
and
passed
it
to
me
i
screwed
a
jeweler
glass
into
my
eye
and
examined
it
in
astonished
silence
it
was
an
emerald
a
fine
large
immensely
valuable
stone
if
my
experience
counted
for
anything
one
side
of
it
was
thickly
coated
with
vermilion
paint
where
did
this
come
from
i
asked
in
an
agitated
voice
from
the
floor
of
the
crater
is
it
an
emerald
i
lifted
my
head
and
stared
at
the
girl
incredulously
it
happened
this
way
she
said
excitedly
father
was
painting
a
picture
up
there
by
the
edge
of
the
crater
he
left
his
palette
on
the
grass
to
go
to
the
bungalow
for
some
more
tubes
of
colour
while
he
was
in
the
house
hunting
for
the
colours
which
he
wanted
i
stepped
out
on
the
veranda
and
i
saw
some
crows
alight
near
the
palette
and
begin
to
stalk
about
in
the
grass
one
bird
walked
right
over
his
wet
palette
i
stepped
out
and
waved
my
to
frighten
him
off
but
he
had
both
feet
in
a
sticky
mass
of
chinese
vermilion
and
for
a
moment
was
unable
to
free
himself
i
almost
caught
him
but
he
flapped
away
over
the
edge
of
the
crater
high
above
the
wall
of
vapour
sailed
down
onto
the
crater
floor
and
alighted
but
his
feet
bothered
him
he
kept
hopping
about
on
the
bottom
of
the
crater
half
running
half
flying
and
finally
he
took
wing
and
rose
up
over
the
hill
as
he
flew
above
me
and
while
i
was
looking
up
at
his
vermilion
feet
something
dropped
from
his
claws
and
nearly
struck
me
it
was
that
emerald
when
i
had
recovered
sufficient
composure
to
speak
steadily
i
took
her
beautiful
little
hand
in
mine
this
said
i
is
the
most
exciting
locality
i
have
ever
visited
for
purposes
of
scientific
research
within
this
crater
may
lie
millions
of
value
in
emeralds
you
are
probably
today
the
wealthiest
heiress
upon
the
face
of
the
globe
i
gave
her
a
winning
glance
she
smiled
shyly
and
blushingly
withdrew
her
hand
for
several
exquisite
minutes
i
sat
there
beside
her
in
a
sort
of
heavenly
trance
how
beautiful
she
was
how
engaging
how
sweet
how
modestly
appreciative
of
the
man
beside
her
who
had
little
beside
his
scientific
learning
his
fame
and
a
kind
heart
to
appeal
to
such
youth
and
loveliness
as
hers
there
was
something
about
her
that
delicately
appealed
to
me
sometimes
i
pondered
what
this
might
be
sometimes
i
wondered
how
many
emeralds
lay
on
that
floor
of
sandy
gravel
below
us
yes
i
loved
her
i
realised
it
now
i
could
even
endure
her
father
for
her
sake
i
should
make
a
good
husband
i
was
quite
certain
of
that
i
turned
and
gazed
upon
her
meltingly
but
i
did
not
wish
to
startle
her
so
i
remained
silent
permitting
the
chaste
language
of
my
eyes
to
interpret
for
her
what
my
lips
had
not
yet
murmured
it
was
a
brief
but
beautiful
moment
in
my
life
the
way
to
do
said
i
is
to
trap
several
dozen
crows
smear
their
feet
with
glue
tie
a
ball
of
indian
twine
to
the
ankle
of
every
bird
then
liberate
them
some
are
certain
to
fly
into
the
crater
and
try
to
scrape
the
glue
off
in
the
sand
then
i
added
triumphantly
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
haul
in
our
birds
and
detach
the
wealth
of
midas
from
their
sticky
claws
that
is
an
excellent
suggestion
she
said
gratefully
but
i
can
do
that
after
you
have
gone
all
i
wanted
you
to
tell
me
was
whether
the
stone
is
a
genuine
emerald
i
gazed
at
her
blankly
you
are
here
for
purposes
of
scientific
investigation
she
added
sweetly
i
should
not
think
of
taking
your
time
for
the
mere
sake
of
accumulating
wealth
for
my
father
and
me
there
did
seem
to
be
anything
for
me
to
say
at
that
moment
chilled
i
gazed
at
the
flashing
ring
of
fire
and
as
i
gazed
suddenly
i
became
aware
of
a
little
pointed
muzzle
two
ears
and
two
eyes
gazing
intently
out
at
me
from
the
mass
of
flames
the
girl
beside
me
saw
it
too
do
move
she
whispered
that
is
one
of
the
flame
creatures
it
may
venture
out
if
you
keep
perfectly
still
rigid
with
amazement
i
sat
like
a
stone
image
staring
at
the
most
astonishing
sight
i
had
ever
beheld
for
several
minutes
the
creature
never
stirred
from
where
it
crouched
in
the
crater
fire
the
alert
head
remained
pointed
toward
us
i
could
even
see
that
its
thick
fur
must
have
possessed
the
qualities
of
asbestos
because
here
and
there
a
hair
or
two
glimmered
incandescent
and
its
eyes
nose
and
whiskers
glowed
and
glowed
as
the
flames
pulsated
around
it
after
a
long
while
it
began
to
move
out
of
the
fire
slowly
cautiously
cunning
eyes
fixed
on
us
a
small
slim
wiry
creature
on
which
the
sunlight
fell
with
a
vitreous
glitter
as
it
crept
forward
into
the
grass
then
from
the
fire
behind
another
creature
of
the
same
sort
appeared
another
others
then
dozens
of
eager
lithe
little
animals
appeared
everywhere
from
the
flames
and
began
to
frisk
and
play
and
run
about
in
the
grass
and
nibble
the
fresh
green
succulent
herbage
with
a
snipping
sound
quite
audible
to
us
one
came
so
near
my
feet
that
i
could
examine
it
minutely
its
fur
and
whiskers
seemed
heavy
and
dense
and
like
asbestos
fibre
yet
so
fine
as
to
appear
silky
its
eyes
nose
and
claws
were
scarlet
and
seemed
to
possess
a
glassy
surface
i
waited
my
opportunity
and
when
the
little
thing
came
nosing
along
within
reach
i
seized
it
instantly
it
emitted
a
bewildering
series
of
whistling
shrieks
and
twisted
around
to
bite
me
its
body
was
icy
do
let
it
bite
cried
the
girl
be
careful
mr
smith
illustration
let
it
bite
cried
the
girl
careful
mr
smith
but
its
jaws
were
toothless
only
soft
cold
gums
pinched
me
and
i
held
it
twisting
and
writhing
while
the
icy
temperature
of
its
body
began
to
benumb
my
fingers
and
creep
up
my
wrist
paralyzing
my
arm
and
its
incessant
and
piercing
shrieks
deafened
me
in
vain
i
transferred
it
to
the
other
hand
and
then
passed
it
from
one
hand
to
the
other
as
one
shifts
a
lump
of
ice
or
a
hot
potato
in
an
attempt
to
endure
the
temperature
it
shrieked
and
squirmed
and
doubled
and
finally
wriggled
out
of
my
stiffened
and
useless
hands
and
scuttled
away
into
the
fire
it
was
an
overwhelming
disappointment
for
a
moment
it
seemed
unendurable
never
mind
i
said
huskily
if
i
caught
one
in
my
hands
i
can
surely
catch
another
in
a
trap
i
am
so
sorry
for
your
disappointment
she
said
pitifully
do
care
miss
blythe
i
asked
she
blushed
of
course
i
care
she
murmured
my
hands
were
too
badly
to
become
eloquent
i
merely
sighed
and
thrust
them
into
my
pockets
even
my
arm
was
too
stiff
to
encircle
her
shapeful
waist
devotion
to
science
had
temporarily
crippled
me
love
must
wait
but
as
we
ascended
the
grassy
slope
together
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
make
her
a
good
husband
and
that
i
should
spend
at
least
part
of
every
day
of
my
life
in
trapping
crows
and
smearing
their
claws
with
glue
that
evening
i
was
seated
on
the
veranda
beside
wilna
miss
blythe
name
was
wilna
and
what
with
gazing
at
her
and
fitting
together
some
of
the
folding
which
i
always
carried
with
me
and
what
with
trying
to
realise
the
pecuniary
magnificence
of
our
future
existence
together
i
was
exceedingly
busy
when
blythe
came
in
to
display
as
i
supposed
his
most
recent
daub
to
me
the
canvas
he
carried
presented
a
series
of
crimson
speckles
out
of
which
burst
an
eruption
of
green
streaks
and
it
made
me
think
of
stepping
on
a
caterpillar
my
instinct
was
to
placate
this
impossible
man
he
was
father
i
meant
to
honour
him
if
i
had
to
assault
him
to
do
it
supremely
satisfying
i
nodded
chary
of
naming
the
subject
it
is
a
stride
beyond
the
art
of
the
future
it
is
a
flying
leap
out
of
the
not
yet
into
the
possibly
perhaps
i
thank
you
for
enlightening
me
blythe
i
am
your
debtor
he
fairly
snarled
at
me
what
are
talking
about
he
demanded
i
remained
modestly
mute
to
wilna
he
said
pointing
passionately
at
his
canvas
the
crows
have
been
walking
all
over
it
again
i
going
to
paint
in
the
woods
after
this
earthquakes
or
no
earthquakes
have
the
trees
been
heaved
up
anywhere
recently
not
since
last
week
she
said
soothingly
it
usually
happens
after
a
rain
i
think
i
risk
it
then
although
it
did
rain
early
this
morning
do
a
moonlight
down
there
this
evening
and
turning
to
me
if
you
know
as
much
about
science
as
you
do
about
art
you
wo
have
to
remain
here
long
i
trust
what
said
i
very
red
he
laughed
a
highly
disagreeable
laugh
and
marched
into
the
house
presently
he
bawled
for
dinner
and
wilna
went
away
for
her
sake
i
had
remained
calm
and
dignified
but
presently
i
went
out
and
kicked
up
the
turf
two
or
three
times
and
having
foozled
my
wrath
i
went
back
to
dinner
realising
that
i
might
as
well
begin
to
accustom
myself
to
my
future
it
seemed
that
he
had
a
mania
for
prunes
and
that
all
he
permitted
anybody
to
have
for
dinner
disgusted
i
attempted
to
swallow
the
loathly
stewed
fruit
watching
blythe
askance
as
he
hurriedly
stuffed
himself
using
a
tablespoon
with
every
symptom
of
relish
now
he
cried
shoving
back
his
chair
i
going
to
paint
a
moonlight
by
moonlight
wilna
if
billy
arrives
make
him
comfortable
and
tell
him
i
return
by
midnight
and
without
taking
the
trouble
to
notice
me
at
all
he
strode
away
toward
the
veranda
chewing
vigorously
upon
his
last
prune
your
father
said
i
is
eccentric
genius
usually
is
but
he
is
a
most
interesting
and
estimable
man
i
revere
him
it
is
kind
of
you
to
say
so
said
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
i
thought
deeply
for
a
few
moments
then
who
is
i
inquired
casually
i
could
tell
whether
it
was
a
sudden
gleam
of
sunset
light
on
her
face
or
whether
she
blushed
billy
she
said
softly
is
a
friend
of
father
his
name
is
william
green
oh
he
is
coming
out
here
to
visit
father
i
believe
oh
an
artist
and
doubtless
of
mature
years
he
is
a
mineralogist
by
profession
she
said
and
somewhat
young
oh
years
old
she
added
upon
her
pretty
face
was
an
absent
expression
vaguely
pleasant
her
blue
eyes
became
dreamy
and
exquisitely
remote
i
pondered
deeply
for
a
while
wilna
i
said
yes
mr
smith
as
though
aroused
from
agreeable
meditation
but
i
did
know
exactly
what
to
say
and
i
remained
uneasily
silent
thinking
about
that
man
green
and
his
years
and
his
profession
and
the
bottom
of
the
crater
and
wilna
and
striving
to
satisfy
myself
that
there
was
no
logical
connection
between
any
of
these
i
think
said
i
that
i
take
a
bucket
of
salad
to
your
father
why
i
should
have
so
suddenly
determined
to
ingratiate
myself
with
the
old
grouch
i
scarcely
understood
for
the
construction
of
a
salad
was
my
very
best
accomplishment
wilna
looked
at
me
in
a
peculiar
manner
almost
as
though
she
were
controlling
a
sudden
and
not
unpleasant
inward
desire
to
laugh
evidently
the
finer
and
more
delicate
instincts
of
a
woman
were
divining
my
motive
and
sympathizing
with
my
mental
and
sentimental
perplexity
so
when
she
said
i
do
think
you
had
better
go
near
my
father
i
was
convinced
of
her
gentle
solicitude
in
my
behalf
with
a
bucket
of
salad
i
whispered
softly
much
may
be
accomplished
wilna
and
i
took
her
little
hand
and
pressed
it
gently
and
respectfully
trust
all
to
me
i
murmured
she
stood
with
her
head
turned
away
from
me
her
slim
hand
resting
limply
in
mine
from
the
slight
tremor
of
her
shoulders
i
became
aware
how
deeply
her
emotion
was
now
swaying
her
evidently
she
was
nearly
ready
to
become
mine
but
i
remained
calm
and
alert
the
time
was
not
yet
her
father
had
had
his
prunes
in
which
he
delighted
and
when
pleasantly
approached
with
a
bucket
of
salad
he
could
not
listen
otherwise
than
politely
to
what
i
had
to
say
to
him
quick
action
was
necessary
quick
but
diplomatic
action
in
view
of
the
imminence
of
this
young
man
green
who
evidently
was
at
the
bungalow
of
this
irritable
old
dodo
tenderly
pressing
the
pretty
hand
which
i
held
and
saluting
the
with
a
gesture
which
was
perhaps
not
wholly
ungraceful
i
stepped
into
the
kitchen
washed
out
several
heads
of
lettuce
deftly
chopped
up
some
youthful
onions
constructed
a
seductive
french
dressing
and
stirring
together
the
crisp
ingredients
set
the
savoury
masterpiece
away
in
the
after
tasting
it
it
was
delicious
enough
to
draw
sobs
from
any
pig
when
i
went
out
to
the
veranda
wilna
had
disappeared
so
i
unfolded
and
set
up
some
more
determined
to
lose
no
time
sunset
still
lingered
beyond
the
chain
of
western
mountains
as
i
went
out
across
the
grassy
plateau
to
the
cornfield
here
i
set
and
baited
several
dozen
aluminium
padding
the
jaws
so
that
no
injury
could
be
done
to
the
birds
when
the
springs
snapped
on
their
legs
then
i
went
over
to
the
crater
and
descended
its
gentle
grassy
slope
and
there
all
along
the
borders
of
the
vapoury
wall
i
set
for
the
lithe
little
denizens
of
the
fire
baiting
every
trap
with
a
handful
of
fresh
sweet
clover
which
i
had
pulled
up
from
the
pasture
beyond
the
cornfield
my
task
ended
i
ascended
the
slope
again
and
for
a
while
stood
there
immersed
in
pleasurable
premonitions
everything
had
been
accomplished
swiftly
and
methodically
within
the
few
hours
in
which
i
had
first
set
eyes
upon
this
extraordinary
place
everything
love
at
first
sight
the
delightfully
wooing
and
winning
of
an
incomparable
maiden
and
heiress
the
discovery
of
the
fire
creatures
the
solving
of
the
emerald
problem
and
now
everything
was
ready
a
bucket
of
irresistible
salad
for
blythe
a
modest
and
tremulous
avowal
for
wilna
as
soon
as
her
father
tasted
the
salad
and
i
had
pleasantly
notified
him
of
my
intentions
concerning
his
lovely
offspring
daylight
faded
from
rose
to
lilac
already
the
mountains
were
growing
under
that
vague
diffuse
lustre
which
heralds
the
rise
of
the
full
moon
it
rose
enormous
yellow
unreal
becoming
imperceptibly
silvery
as
it
climbed
the
sky
and
hung
aloft
like
a
stupendous
flooding
the
world
with
a
radiance
so
white
and
clear
that
i
could
very
easily
have
written
verses
by
it
if
i
wrote
verses
down
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
i
could
see
blythe
on
his
madly
besmearing
his
moonlit
canvas
but
i
could
not
see
wilna
anywhere
maybe
she
had
shyly
retired
somewhere
by
herself
to
think
of
me
so
i
went
back
to
the
house
filled
a
bucket
with
my
salad
and
started
toward
the
edge
of
the
woods
singing
happily
as
i
sped
on
feet
so
light
and
frolicsome
that
they
seemed
to
skim
the
ground
how
wonderful
is
the
power
of
love
when
i
approached
blythe
he
heard
me
coming
and
turned
around
what
the
devil
do
want
he
asked
with
characteristic
civility
i
have
brought
you
said
i
gaily
a
bucket
of
salad
i
do
want
any
salad
i
never
eat
it
at
night
i
said
confidently
blythe
if
you
will
taste
this
salad
i
am
sure
you
will
not
regret
it
and
with
hideous
cunning
i
set
the
bucket
beside
him
on
the
grass
and
seated
myself
near
it
the
old
dodo
grunted
and
continued
to
daub
the
canvas
but
presently
as
though
forgetfully
and
from
sheer
instinct
he
reached
down
into
the
bucket
pulled
out
a
leaf
of
lettuce
and
shoved
it
into
his
mouth
my
heart
leaped
exultantly
i
had
him
blythe
i
began
in
a
winningly
modulated
voice
and
at
the
same
instant
he
sprang
from
his
his
face
distorted
there
are
onions
in
this
salad
he
yelled
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
are
you
trying
to
poison
me
what
are
you
following
me
about
for
anyway
why
are
you
running
about
under
foot
every
minute
my
dear
blythe
i
protested
but
he
barked
at
me
kicked
over
the
bucket
of
salad
and
began
to
dance
with
rage
illustration
kicked
over
the
bucket
of
salad
and
began
to
dance
with
rage
what
the
matter
with
you
anyway
he
bawled
why
are
you
trying
to
feed
me
what
do
you
mean
by
trying
to
be
attentive
to
me
i
i
admire
and
revere
you
no
you
do
he
shouted
i
do
want
you
to
admire
me
i
desire
to
be
revered
i
do
like
attention
and
politeness
do
you
hear
it
artificial
out
of
date
ridiculous
the
only
thing
that
recommends
a
man
to
me
is
his
bad
manners
bad
temper
and
violent
habits
some
meaning
to
such
a
man
none
at
all
to
men
like
you
he
ran
at
the
salad
bucket
and
kicked
it
again
they
all
fawned
on
me
in
boston
he
panted
they
ran
about
under
foot
they
bought
my
pictures
and
they
made
me
sick
i
came
out
here
to
be
rid
of
i
rose
from
the
grass
pale
and
determined
you
listen
to
me
you
old
grouch
i
hissed
i
go
but
before
i
go
i
tell
you
why
i
been
civil
to
you
there
only
one
reason
in
the
world
i
want
to
marry
your
daughter
and
i
going
to
do
it
i
stepped
nearer
him
menacing
him
with
outstretched
hand
as
for
you
you
pitiable
old
dodo
with
your
bad
manners
and
your
worse
pictures
and
your
degraded
mania
for
prunes
you
are
a
necessary
evil
that
all
and
i
have
the
slightest
respect
for
either
you
or
your
art
is
that
true
he
said
in
an
altered
voice
true
i
laughed
bitterly
of
course
it
true
you
miserable
dauber
he
stammered
certainly
i
and
i
mean
it
why
your
work
would
shame
the
pictures
on
a
child
slate
smith
he
said
unsteadily
i
believe
i
have
utterly
misjudged
you
i
believe
you
are
a
good
deal
of
a
man
after
all
i
man
enough
said
i
fiercely
to
go
back
saddle
my
mule
kidnap
your
daughter
and
start
for
home
and
i
going
to
do
it
wait
he
cried
i
do
want
you
to
go
if
you
remain
i
be
very
glad
i
do
anything
you
like
i
quarrel
with
you
and
you
can
insult
my
pictures
it
will
agreeably
stimulate
us
both
do
go
smith
if
i
stay
may
i
marry
wilna
if
you
ask
me
i
wo
let
you
very
well
i
retorted
angrily
then
i
marry
her
anyway
that
the
way
to
talk
do
go
smith
i
really
beginning
to
like
you
and
when
billy
green
arrives
you
and
he
will
have
a
delightfully
violent
scene
what
he
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
he
in
love
with
wilna
you
and
he
wo
get
on
it
is
going
to
be
very
stimulating
for
me
i
can
see
that
you
and
he
are
going
to
behave
most
disagreeably
to
each
other
and
i
shall
be
exceedingly
unpleasant
to
you
both
come
smith
promise
me
that
you
stay
profoundly
worried
i
stood
staring
at
him
in
the
moonlight
gnawing
my
mustache
very
well
i
said
i
remain
if
something
checked
me
i
did
not
quite
know
what
for
a
moment
blythe
too
was
staring
at
me
in
an
odd
apprehensive
way
suddenly
i
realised
that
under
my
feet
the
ground
was
stirring
look
out
i
cried
but
speech
froze
on
my
lips
as
beneath
me
the
solid
earth
began
to
rock
and
crack
and
billow
up
into
a
high
crumbling
ridge
moving
continually
as
the
sod
cracks
heaves
up
and
crumbles
above
the
subterranean
progress
of
a
mole
up
into
the
air
we
were
slowly
pushed
on
the
ridge
and
with
us
were
carried
rocks
and
bushes
and
sod
and
even
forest
trees
i
could
hear
their
part
with
reports
see
great
pines
and
hemlocks
and
oaks
moving
slanting
settling
tilting
crazily
in
every
direction
as
they
were
heaved
upward
in
this
gigantic
disturbance
blythe
caught
me
by
the
arm
we
clutched
each
other
balancing
on
the
crest
of
the
steadily
rising
mound
is
it
he
stammered
look
it
circular
the
woods
are
rising
in
a
huge
circle
what
happening
do
you
know
over
me
crept
a
horrible
certainty
that
was
moving
under
us
through
the
depths
of
the
earth
something
that
as
it
progressed
was
heaping
up
the
surface
of
the
world
above
its
unseen
and
burrowing
course
something
dreadful
enormous
sinister
and
look
out
screamed
blythe
and
at
the
same
instant
the
crumbling
summit
of
the
ridge
opened
under
our
feet
and
a
fissure
hundreds
of
yards
long
yawned
ahead
of
us
and
along
it
shining
slimily
in
the
moonlight
a
vast
viscous
ringed
surface
was
moving
retracting
undulating
elongating
writhing
squirming
shuddering
it
a
worm
shrieked
blythe
oh
god
it
a
mile
long
illustration
a
worm
shrieked
blythe
as
in
a
nightmare
we
clutched
each
other
struggling
frantically
to
avoid
the
fissure
but
the
soft
earth
slid
and
gave
way
under
us
and
we
fell
heavily
upon
that
ghastly
living
surface
instantly
a
violent
convulsion
hurled
us
upward
we
fell
on
it
again
rebounding
from
the
rubbery
thing
strove
to
regain
our
feet
and
scramble
up
the
edges
of
the
fissure
strove
madly
while
the
mammoth
worm
slid
more
rapidly
through
the
rocking
forests
carrying
us
forward
with
a
speed
increasing
through
the
forest
we
tore
reeling
about
on
the
slippery
back
of
the
thing
as
though
riding
on
a
plowshare
while
trees
clashed
and
tilted
and
fell
from
the
enormous
furrow
on
every
side
then
suddenly
out
of
the
woods
into
the
moonlight
far
ahead
of
us
we
could
see
the
grassy
upland
heave
up
cake
break
and
crumble
above
the
burrowing
course
of
the
monster
it
making
for
the
crater
gasped
blythe
and
horror
spurred
us
on
and
we
scrambled
and
slipped
and
clawed
the
billowing
sides
of
the
furrow
until
we
gained
the
heaving
top
of
it
as
one
runs
in
a
bad
dream
heavily
so
ran
blythe
and
i
toiling
over
the
undulating
tumbling
upheaval
until
we
fell
and
rolled
down
the
shifting
slope
onto
solid
and
unvexed
sod
on
the
very
edges
of
the
crater
below
us
we
saw
with
sickened
eyes
the
entire
circumference
of
the
crater
agitated
saw
it
rise
and
fall
as
avalanches
of
rock
and
earth
slid
into
it
tons
and
thousands
of
tons
rushing
down
the
slope
blotting
from
our
sight
the
flickering
ring
of
flame
and
extinguishing
the
last
filmy
jet
of
vapour
suddenly
the
entire
crater
caved
in
and
filled
up
under
my
anguished
eyes
quenching
for
all
eternity
the
vapour
wall
the
fire
and
burying
the
little
denizens
of
the
flames
and
perhaps
a
billion
dollars
worth
of
emeralds
under
as
many
billion
tons
of
earth
quieter
and
quieter
grew
the
earth
as
the
gigantic
worm
bored
straight
down
into
depths
immeasurable
and
at
last
the
moon
shone
upon
a
world
that
lay
without
a
tremor
in
its
milky
lustre
i
shall
name
it
said
i
with
a
hysterical
sob
but
nobody
will
ever
believe
me
when
i
tell
this
story
still
terribly
shaken
we
turned
toward
the
house
and
as
we
approached
the
lamplit
veranda
i
saw
a
horse
standing
there
and
a
young
man
hastily
dismounting
and
then
a
terrible
thing
occurred
for
before
i
could
even
shriek
wilna
had
put
both
arms
around
that
young
man
neck
and
both
of
his
arms
were
clasping
her
waist
blythe
was
kind
to
me
he
took
me
around
the
back
way
and
put
me
to
bed
and
there
i
lay
through
the
most
awful
night
i
ever
experienced
listening
to
the
piano
below
where
wilna
and
william
green
were
singing
un
peu
the
eggs
of
the
silver
moon
in
the
new
white
marble
administration
building
at
bronx
park
my
private
office
separated
the
offices
of
silas
quint
and
professor
boomly
and
it
had
been
arranged
so
on
purpose
because
of
the
increasingly
frequent
personal
misunderstanding
between
these
two
celebrated
entomologists
it
was
very
plain
to
me
that
a
crisis
in
this
quarrel
was
rapidly
approaching
a
bitter
animosity
had
for
some
months
existed
on
both
sides
born
of
the
most
intense
professional
jealousy
they
had
been
friends
for
years
no
unseemly
rivalry
disturbed
this
friendship
as
long
as
it
was
merely
a
question
of
collecting
preparing
and
mounting
for
exhibition
the
vast
numbers
of
butterflies
and
moths
which
haunt
this
insectivorous
earth
even
their
zeal
in
the
eternal
hunt
for
new
and
undescribed
species
had
not
made
them
enemies
i
am
afraid
that
my
suggestion
for
the
construction
of
a
great
glass
for
specimens
of
moths
and
butterflies
started
the
trouble
between
these
hitherto
godly
and
men
that
and
the
carnegie
educational
medal
were
the
causes
which
began
this
deplorable
affair
various
field
collectors
employed
by
both
quint
and
boomly
were
always
out
all
over
the
world
foraging
for
specimens
also
they
were
constantly
returning
with
spoils
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
now
to
secure
rare
and
beautiful
living
specimens
of
butterflies
and
moths
for
the
crystal
was
a
serious
and
delicate
job
such
tropical
insects
could
not
survive
the
journey
of
several
months
from
the
wilds
of
australia
india
asia
africa
or
the
jungles
of
south
america
nor
could
species
endure
the
captivity
of
a
few
weeks
or
even
days
when
captured
in
the
west
indies
mexico
or
florida
only
our
smaller
and
hardier
native
species
tolerated
capture
and
exhibition
therefore
the
mode
of
procedure
which
i
suggested
was
for
our
field
expeditions
to
obtain
males
and
females
of
the
same
species
of
butterfly
or
moth
mate
them
and
as
soon
as
any
female
deposited
her
eggs
place
the
tiny
eggs
in
cold
storage
to
retard
their
hatching
which
normally
occurs
in
the
majority
of
species
within
ten
days
or
two
weeks
this
now
was
the
usual
mode
of
procedure
followed
by
the
field
collectors
employed
by
quint
and
professor
boomly
and
not
only
were
the
eggs
of
various
butterflies
and
moths
so
packed
for
transportation
but
a
sufficient
store
of
their
various
native
was
also
preserved
where
such
could
not
be
procured
in
the
united
states
so
when
the
eggs
arrived
at
bronx
park
and
were
hatched
there
in
due
time
the
young
caterpillars
had
plenty
of
nourishment
ready
for
them
in
cold
storage
might
i
not
legitimately
have
expected
the
carnegie
educational
medal
for
all
this
i
have
never
received
it
i
say
this
without
indignation
even
without
sorrow
i
merely
make
the
statement
yet
my
system
was
really
a
very
beautiful
system
a
tiny
batch
of
eggs
would
arrive
from
ceylon
or
sumatra
or
africa
when
taken
from
cold
storage
and
placed
in
the
herbarium
they
would
presently
hatch
the
caterpillars
were
fed
with
their
accustomed
a
few
leaves
being
taken
from
cold
storage
every
day
for
them
they
would
pass
through
their
three
or
four
moulting
periods
cease
feeding
in
due
time
transform
into
the
chrysalis
stage
and
finally
appear
in
all
the
splendour
and
magnificence
of
butterfly
or
moth
the
great
glass
was
now
alive
with
superb
moths
and
butterflies
flitting
darting
fluttering
among
the
flowering
bushes
or
feeding
along
the
sandy
banks
of
the
brook
which
flowed
through
the
bordered
by
thickets
of
scented
flowers
and
it
was
like
looking
at
a
meteoric
shower
of
winged
jewels
where
the
huge
from
south
america
flapped
and
sailed
and
the
orange
and
gold
and
green
from
borneo
pursued
their
majestic
flight
where
big
glittering
flashed
through
the
bushes
or
alighted
nervously
to
feed
for
a
few
moments
on
jasmine
and
phlox
and
where
the
slowly
flopping
winged
their
way
amid
the
denser
tangles
of
tropical
vegetation
nothing
like
this
had
ever
before
been
seen
in
new
york
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
thronged
the
lawn
about
the
all
day
long
by
night
also
the
effect
was
wonderful
the
electric
lights
among
the
foliage
broke
out
the
great
moths
which
had
been
asleep
all
day
while
the
butterflies
flitted
through
the
sunshine
now
came
out
to
display
their
crimson
or
wings
and
the
butterflies
folded
their
wings
and
went
to
bed
for
the
night
the
public
was
enchanted
the
authorities
of
the
bronx
proud
and
delighted
all
apparently
was
happiness
and
harmony
except
that
nobody
offered
me
the
carnegie
medal
i
was
sitting
one
morning
in
my
office
which
as
i
have
said
separated
the
offices
of
quint
and
professor
boomly
when
there
came
a
loud
rapping
on
my
door
and
at
my
invitation
quint
bustled
in
a
little
meagre
excitable
man
with
pointed
mustaches
and
a
fleck
of
an
imperial
smudging
his
lower
lip
last
week
he
began
angrily
young
jones
arrived
from
singapore
bringing
me
the
eggs
of
the
great
silver
moon
butterfly
attempts
to
destroy
them
have
been
made
last
night
i
left
them
in
a
on
my
desk
has
anybody
been
in
there
i
do
know
i
said
what
has
happened
i
found
an
ichneumon
fly
in
the
cage
yesterday
he
shouted
and
this
morning
the
eggs
have
either
shrunk
to
half
their
size
or
else
the
eggs
of
another
species
have
been
secretly
substituted
for
them
and
the
silver
moon
eggs
stolen
has
been
in
there
who
i
asked
pretending
to
misunderstand
demanded
quint
fiercely
if
he
has
i
kill
him
some
day
meant
his
friend
boomly
alas
for
heaven
sake
why
are
you
two
perpetually
squabbling
i
asked
wearily
you
used
to
be
inseparable
friends
why
ca
you
make
up
because
i
come
to
know
him
that
why
i
have
unmasked
this
this
borgia
this
machiavelli
this
monster
of
duplicity
matters
are
approaching
a
point
where
something
has
got
to
be
done
short
of
murder
i
stood
all
his
envy
and
jealousy
and
cheap
imputations
and
hints
and
contemptible
innuendoes
that
i
going
to
he
stopped
short
glaring
at
the
doorway
which
had
suddenly
been
darkened
by
the
vast
bulk
of
professor
boomly
a
figure
largely
abdominal
but
majestic
like
the
massive
butt
end
of
an
elephant
for
the
rest
he
had
a
rather
insignificant
and
peevish
face
and
a
melancholy
mustache
that
usually
looked
damp
smith
he
said
to
me
in
his
thin
high
sarcastic
voice
a
voice
incongruously
at
variance
with
his
bulk
has
anybody
had
the
infernal
impudence
to
enter
my
room
and
nose
about
my
desk
yes
have
replied
quint
excitedly
i
been
in
your
room
what
of
it
what
about
it
boomly
permitted
his
eyes
to
rest
on
quint
for
a
moment
then
turning
to
me
i
want
a
patent
lock
put
on
my
door
will
you
speak
to
professor
farrago
i
want
one
put
on
mine
too
cried
quint
i
want
a
lock
put
on
my
door
which
will
keep
envious
mentally
impertinent
and
fat
people
out
of
my
office
boomly
flushed
heavily
fat
he
repeated
glaring
at
quint
did
you
say
yes
fat
intellectually
and
corporeally
fat
i
want
that
kind
of
individual
kept
out
i
do
trust
them
i
afraid
of
them
their
minds
are
atrophied
they
are
unmoral
possibly
even
criminal
i
do
want
them
in
my
room
snooping
about
to
see
what
i
have
and
what
i
doing
i
do
want
them
to
sneak
in
eaten
up
with
jealousy
and
envy
and
try
to
damage
the
eggs
of
the
silver
moon
butterfly
because
the
honour
and
glory
of
hatching
them
would
probably
procure
for
me
the
carnegie
educational
medal
why
you
little
protoplasmic
atom
burst
out
boomly
his
face
suffused
with
passion
are
you
insinuating
that
i
have
any
designs
on
your
batch
of
eggs
it
my
belief
shouted
quint
that
you
want
that
medal
yourself
and
that
you
put
an
ichneumon
fly
in
my
in
hopes
it
would
sting
the
eggs
of
the
silver
moon
if
you
found
an
ichneumon
fly
there
retorted
boomly
you
probably
hatched
it
in
mistake
for
a
butterfly
and
he
burst
into
a
peal
of
contemptuous
laughter
but
his
little
eyes
under
the
heavy
lids
were
furious
i
now
believe
said
quint
trembling
with
rage
that
you
have
criminally
substituted
a
batch
of
common
eggs
for
the
silver
moon
eggs
i
had
in
my
i
believe
you
are
sufficiently
abandoned
to
do
it
ha
ha
retorted
boomly
scornfully
i
do
believe
you
ever
had
anything
in
your
except
a
few
clothes
moths
and
cockroaches
quint
began
to
dance
you
take
them
he
yelled
and
you
left
me
a
bunch
of
milkweed
butterflies
eggs
give
me
my
eggs
or
i
shall
violently
assault
you
assault
your
grandmother
remarked
boomly
with
unscientific
brevity
what
do
you
suppose
i
want
of
your
ridiculous
eggs
have
i
enough
eggs
of
hatching
to
give
me
the
carnegie
medal
if
i
want
it
the
silver
moon
eggs
are
unique
cried
quint
you
know
it
you
know
that
if
they
hatch
pupate
and
become
perfect
insects
that
i
shall
certainly
be
awarded
you
be
awarded
the
matteawan
medal
remarked
boomly
with
venom
quint
ran
at
him
with
a
howl
his
momentum
carrying
him
halfway
up
professor
boomly
person
then
losing
foothold
he
fell
to
the
floor
and
began
to
kick
in
the
general
direction
of
professor
boomly
it
was
a
sorrowful
sight
to
see
these
two
celebrated
scientists
panting
mauling
scuffling
and
punching
each
other
around
the
room
tables
and
chairs
and
scrapbaskets
flying
in
every
direction
and
i
mounted
on
the
horrified
speechless
trying
to
keep
clear
of
the
revolving
storm
centre
where
are
my
silver
moon
eggs
screamed
quint
where
are
my
eggs
that
jones
brought
me
from
singapore
you
entomological
robber
got
somewhere
if
you
do
give
up
i
find
means
to
destroy
you
you
insignificant
pair
of
maxillary
palpi
bellowed
professor
boomly
galloping
after
quint
as
he
dodged
around
my
desk
i
pull
off
those
antennæ
you
call
whiskers
if
i
can
get
hold
of
em
quint
threatened
mustaches
bristled
as
he
fled
before
the
elephantine
charge
of
professor
boomly
once
again
around
my
desk
then
out
into
the
hall
where
i
heard
the
door
of
his
office
slam
and
boomly
gasping
panting
breathing
vengeance
outside
and
vowing
to
leave
quint
quite
whiskerless
when
he
caught
him
it
was
a
painful
scene
for
scientists
to
figure
in
or
to
gaze
upon
profoundly
shocked
and
upset
i
locked
up
the
anthropological
department
offices
and
went
out
into
the
park
where
the
sun
was
shining
and
a
gentle
june
wind
stirred
the
trees
too
completely
upset
to
do
any
more
work
that
day
i
wandered
about
amid
the
gaily
dressed
crowds
at
hazard
sometimes
i
contemplated
the
monkeys
sometimes
gazed
sadly
upon
the
seals
they
dashed
and
splashed
and
raced
round
and
round
their
tank
or
crawled
up
on
the
rocks
craned
their
wet
sleek
necks
and
barked
houp
houp
houp
for
luncheon
i
went
over
to
the
rolling
stone
restaurant
there
was
a
very
pretty
girl
there
an
unusually
pretty
girl
or
perhaps
it
was
one
of
those
days
on
which
every
girl
looked
unusually
pretty
to
me
there
are
such
days
her
voice
was
exquisite
when
she
spoke
she
said
we
have
today
corned
beef
hash
fried
ham
and
eggs
liver
and
bacon
but
let
that
pass
too
i
took
my
tea
very
weak
by
that
time
i
learned
that
her
name
was
mildred
case
that
she
had
been
a
private
detective
employed
in
a
department
store
and
that
her
duties
had
been
to
nab
wealthy
ladies
who
forgot
to
pay
for
objects
usually
discovered
in
their
reticules
bosoms
and
sometimes
in
their
stockings
but
the
confinement
of
indoor
work
had
been
too
much
for
mildred
case
and
the
only
outdoor
job
she
could
find
was
the
position
of
lady
waitress
in
the
rustic
rolling
stone
inn
she
was
very
very
beautiful
or
perhaps
it
was
one
of
those
days
but
let
that
pass
too
you
are
the
great
percy
smith
curator
of
the
anthropological
department
are
you
not
she
asked
shyly
yes
i
said
modestly
and
to
slightly
rebuke
any
superfluous
pride
in
me
i
paraphrased
with
becoming
humility
pointing
upward
but
remember
mildred
there
is
one
greater
than
i
mr
carnegie
she
nodded
innocently
that
was
true
too
i
let
it
go
at
that
we
chatted
she
mentioned
professor
boomly
and
quint
gently
deploring
the
rupture
of
their
friendship
both
gentlemen
in
common
with
the
majority
of
the
administration
personnel
were
daily
customers
at
the
rolling
stone
inn
i
usually
took
my
lunch
from
my
to
my
office
being
too
busy
to
go
out
for
mere
nourishment
that
is
why
i
had
hitherto
missed
mildred
case
mildred
i
said
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
wholesome
for
a
man
to
eat
sandwiches
while
taking
minute
measurements
of
defunct
monkeys
also
it
is
not
a
fragrant
pastime
hereafter
i
shall
lunch
here
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
serve
you
said
that
unusually
there
i
go
again
it
was
an
unusually
beautiful
day
in
june
which
careful
exact
and
scientific
statement
i
think
ought
to
cover
the
subject
under
consideration
after
luncheon
i
sadly
selected
a
cigar
and
as
i
hesitated
lingering
over
the
glass
case
undecided
still
whether
to
give
full
rein
to
this
contemplated
extravagance
i
looked
up
and
found
her
beautiful
grey
eyes
gazing
into
mine
what
gentle
thoughts
are
yours
mildred
i
said
softly
the
cigar
you
have
selected
she
murmured
is
deeply
touched
that
this
young
girl
should
have
cared
that
she
should
have
expressed
her
solicitude
so
modestly
so
sweetly
concerning
the
maculatory
condition
of
my
cigar
i
thanked
her
and
purchased
for
the
same
sum
a
packet
of
cigarettes
that
was
going
somewhat
far
for
me
i
had
never
in
all
my
life
even
dreamed
of
smoking
a
cigarette
to
a
reserved
thoughtful
and
scientific
mind
there
is
about
a
packet
of
cigarettes
something
undignified
something
vaguely
frolicsome
when
i
paid
her
for
them
i
felt
as
though
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
let
myself
go
oddly
enough
in
this
uneasy
feeling
of
gaiety
and
abandon
a
curious
sensation
of
exhilaration
persisted
we
had
quite
a
merry
little
contretemps
when
i
tried
to
light
my
cigarette
and
the
match
went
out
and
then
struck
another
match
and
we
both
laughed
and
match
was
extinguished
by
her
breath
instantly
i
quoted
breath
was
like
the
hay
mr
smith
she
said
flushing
slightly
eyes
i
quoted
like
the
stars
at
even
you
do
mean
eyes
do
you
i
took
a
puff
at
my
unlighted
cigarette
it
also
smelled
like
recently
mown
hay
i
felt
that
i
was
slipping
my
cables
and
heading
toward
an
unknown
and
tempestuous
sea
what
time
are
you
free
mildred
i
asked
scarcely
recognising
my
own
voice
in
such
reckless
apropos
she
shyly
informed
me
i
struck
a
match
relighted
my
cigarette
and
took
one
puff
that
was
sufficient
i
was
adrift
i
realised
it
trembled
internally
took
another
puff
if
said
i
carelessly
on
your
way
home
you
should
chance
to
stroll
along
the
path
beyond
the
path
that
leads
to
the
path
which
i
paused
checked
by
her
bewildered
eyes
we
both
blushed
which
way
do
you
usually
go
home
i
asked
my
ears
afire
illustration
way
do
you
usually
go
home
i
asked
she
told
me
it
was
a
suitably
unfrequented
path
so
presently
i
strolled
thither
and
seated
myself
under
the
trees
in
a
bosky
dell
now
there
is
a
quality
in
boskiness
not
inappropriate
to
romantic
thoughts
boskiness
cigarettes
a
soft
afternoon
in
june
the
hum
of
bees
and
the
distant
barking
of
the
seals
all
these
were
delicately
blending
to
inspire
in
me
a
bashful
sentiment
a
specimen
of
form
alighted
near
me
i
marked
its
flight
with
scientific
indifference
yet
it
is
a
rare
species
in
bronx
park
a
bush
was
in
snowy
bloom
behind
me
great
bunches
of
wistaria
hung
over
the
rock
beside
me
the
combination
of
these
two
exquisite
perfumes
seemed
to
make
the
boskiness
more
bosky
there
was
an
unaccustomed
and
sportive
lightness
to
my
step
when
i
rose
to
meet
mildred
where
she
came
loitering
along
the
path
she
seemed
surprised
to
see
me
she
thought
it
rather
late
to
sit
down
but
she
seated
herself
i
talked
to
her
enthusiastically
about
anthropology
she
was
so
interested
that
after
a
while
she
could
scarcely
keep
still
moving
her
slim
little
feet
restlessly
biting
her
pretty
lower
lip
shifting
her
position
all
certain
symptoms
of
an
interest
in
science
which
even
approached
excitement
warmed
to
the
heart
by
her
eager
and
sympathetic
interest
in
the
noble
science
so
precious
so
dear
to
me
i
took
her
little
hand
to
soothe
and
quiet
her
realizing
that
she
might
become
overexcited
as
i
described
the
pituitary
body
and
why
its
former
functions
had
become
atrophied
until
the
gland
itself
was
nearly
obsolete
so
intense
her
interest
had
been
that
she
seemed
a
little
tired
i
decided
to
give
adequate
material
support
to
her
spinal
process
it
seemed
to
rest
and
soothe
her
i
do
remember
that
she
said
anything
except
mr
i
do
recollect
what
we
were
saying
when
she
mentioned
me
by
name
rather
abruptly
the
afternoon
was
wonderfully
still
and
calm
the
month
was
june
after
a
while
quite
a
while
some
little
time
in
point
of
accurate
fact
she
detected
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
i
remember
that
she
was
seated
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
bench
rather
feverishly
occupied
with
her
hat
and
her
hair
when
young
jones
came
hastily
along
the
path
caught
sight
of
us
halted
turned
violently
red
being
a
shy
young
man
but
instead
of
taking
himself
off
he
seemed
to
recover
from
a
momentary
paralysis
mr
smith
he
said
sharply
professor
boomly
has
disappeared
a
pool
of
blood
on
his
desk
his
coat
hat
and
waistcoat
are
lying
on
the
floor
the
room
is
a
wreck
and
quint
is
in
there
tearing
up
the
carpet
and
behaving
like
a
madman
we
think
he
suddenly
went
insane
and
murdered
professor
boomly
what
is
to
be
done
horrified
i
had
risen
at
his
first
word
and
now
as
i
understood
the
full
purport
of
his
dreadful
message
my
hair
stirred
under
my
hat
and
i
gazed
at
him
appalled
what
is
to
be
done
he
demanded
shall
i
telephone
for
the
police
do
you
actually
believe
i
faltered
that
this
unfortunate
man
has
murdered
boomly
i
do
know
i
looked
over
the
transom
but
i
could
see
professor
boomly
quint
has
locked
the
door
and
he
tearing
up
the
carpet
like
a
lunatic
i
did
want
to
call
in
the
police
until
i
asked
you
such
a
scandal
in
bronx
park
would
be
a
frightful
thing
for
us
all
he
hesitated
looked
around
coldly
it
seemed
to
me
at
mildred
case
a
scandal
he
repeated
is
scarcely
what
might
be
expected
among
a
harmonious
and
earnest
band
of
seekers
after
scientific
knowledge
is
it
mil
miss
case
now
i
do
know
why
mildred
should
have
blushed
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
see
in
this
young
man
question
to
embarrass
her
preoccupied
still
confused
by
the
shock
of
this
terrible
news
i
looked
at
jones
and
at
mildred
and
they
were
staring
rather
oddly
at
each
other
i
said
if
this
affair
turns
out
to
be
as
ghastly
as
it
seems
to
promise
we
have
to
call
in
a
detective
i
go
back
immediately
why
not
take
me
also
asked
mildred
case
quietly
what
i
asked
looking
at
her
why
not
smith
i
was
once
a
private
detective
surprised
at
the
suggestion
i
hesitated
if
you
desire
to
keep
this
matter
secret
if
you
wish
to
have
it
first
investigated
privately
and
quietly
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
let
me
use
my
professional
knowledge
before
you
call
in
the
police
because
as
soon
as
the
police
are
summoned
all
hope
of
avoiding
publicity
is
at
an
end
she
spoke
so
sensibly
so
quietly
so
modestly
that
her
offer
of
assistance
deeply
impressed
me
as
for
young
jones
he
looked
at
her
steadily
in
that
odd
chilling
manner
which
finally
annoyed
me
there
was
no
need
of
his
being
snobbish
because
this
very
lovely
and
intelligent
young
girl
happened
to
be
a
waitress
at
the
rolling
stone
inn
come
i
said
unsteadily
again
a
prey
to
terrifying
emotions
let
us
go
to
the
administration
building
and
learn
how
matters
stand
if
this
affair
is
as
terrible
as
i
fear
it
to
be
science
has
received
the
deadliest
blow
ever
dealt
it
since
cagliostro
perished
as
we
three
strode
hastily
along
the
path
in
the
direction
of
the
administration
building
i
took
that
opportunity
to
read
these
two
youthful
fellow
beings
a
sermon
on
envy
jealousy
and
coveteousness
see
said
i
to
what
a
miserable
condition
the
desire
for
notoriety
and
fame
has
brought
two
learned
and
enthusiastic
delvers
in
the
vineyard
of
endeavor
the
mad
desire
for
the
carnegie
medal
completely
turned
the
hitherto
perfectly
balanced
brains
of
these
devoted
disciples
of
science
envy
begat
envy
jealousy
begat
jealousy
pride
begat
pride
hatred
begat
hatred
it
like
that
book
in
the
bible
where
everybody
begat
everybody
else
said
mildred
seriously
at
first
i
thought
she
had
made
an
apt
and
clever
remark
but
on
thinking
it
over
i
could
quite
see
its
relevancy
i
turned
and
looked
into
her
sweet
face
her
eyes
were
dancing
with
brilliancy
and
her
sensitive
lips
quivered
i
feared
she
was
near
to
tears
from
the
reaction
of
the
shock
had
jones
not
been
walking
with
us
but
let
that
go
too
we
were
now
entering
the
administration
building
almost
running
and
as
soon
as
we
came
to
the
closed
door
of
quint
room
i
could
hear
a
commotion
inside
desk
drawers
being
pulled
out
and
their
contents
dumped
curtains
being
jerked
from
their
rings
an
unmistakable
sound
indicating
the
ripping
up
of
a
carpet
and
through
all
this
din
the
agitated
scuffle
of
footsteps
i
rapped
on
the
door
no
notice
taken
i
rapped
and
knocked
and
called
in
a
low
distinct
voice
suddenly
i
recollected
i
had
a
general
on
my
ring
which
unlocked
any
door
in
the
building
i
nodded
to
jones
and
to
mildred
to
stand
aside
then
gently
fitting
the
key
i
suddenly
pushed
out
the
key
which
remained
on
the
inside
turned
the
lock
and
flung
open
the
door
a
terrible
sight
presented
itself
quint
hair
on
end
both
mustaches
pulled
out
shirt
cuffs
and
white
waistcoat
smeared
with
blood
knelt
amid
the
general
wreckage
on
the
floor
in
the
act
of
ripping
up
the
carpet
doctor
i
cried
in
a
trembling
voice
what
have
you
done
to
professor
boomly
he
paused
in
his
carpet
ripping
and
looked
around
at
us
with
a
terrifying
laugh
i
settled
he
said
if
you
do
want
to
get
all
over
dust
you
better
keep
out
quint
i
cried
are
you
crazy
pretty
nearly
let
me
alone
where
is
boomly
i
demanded
in
a
tragic
voice
where
is
your
old
friend
billy
boomly
where
is
he
quint
and
what
does
mean
that
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
whose
is
it
it
bill
said
quint
coolly
ripping
up
another
breadth
of
carpet
and
peering
under
it
what
i
exclaimed
do
you
admit
that
certainly
i
admit
it
i
told
him
i
terminate
him
if
he
meddled
with
my
silver
moon
eggs
you
mean
to
say
that
you
shed
blood
the
blood
of
your
old
friend
merely
because
he
meddled
with
a
miserable
batch
of
eggs
i
asked
astounded
i
certainly
did
shed
his
blood
for
just
that
particular
thing
and
listen
you
in
my
way
you
standing
on
a
part
of
the
carpet
which
i
want
to
tear
up
do
you
mind
moving
such
calmness
infuriated
me
i
sprang
at
quint
seized
him
and
shouted
to
jones
to
tie
his
hands
behind
him
with
the
handkerchief
which
lay
on
the
floor
at
first
while
jones
and
i
were
engaged
in
the
operation
of
securing
the
wretched
man
quint
looked
at
us
both
as
though
surprised
then
he
grew
angry
and
asked
us
what
the
devil
we
were
about
those
who
shed
blood
must
answer
for
it
i
said
solemnly
what
what
the
matter
with
you
he
demanded
in
a
rage
shed
blood
what
if
i
did
what
that
to
you
untie
this
handkerchief
you
unmentionable
idiot
i
looked
at
jones
his
mind
totters
i
said
hoarsely
what
that
cried
quint
struggling
to
get
off
the
chair
whither
i
had
pushed
him
but
with
my
handkerchief
we
tied
his
ankles
to
the
rung
of
the
chair
heedless
of
his
attempts
to
kick
us
and
sprang
back
out
of
range
now
i
said
what
have
you
done
with
the
poor
victim
of
your
fury
where
is
he
where
is
all
that
remains
of
professor
boomly
boomly
i
do
know
where
he
is
how
the
devil
should
i
know
do
lie
i
said
solemnly
lie
see
here
smith
when
i
get
out
of
this
chair
i
settle
you
too
quint
there
is
another
and
more
terrible
chair
which
awaits
such
criminals
as
you
you
old
fluff
he
shouted
i
knock
your
head
off
too
do
you
understand
i
attend
to
you
as
i
attended
to
boomly
assassin
i
retorted
calmly
only
an
alienist
can
save
you
now
in
this
awful
moment
a
light
touch
on
my
arm
interrupted
me
and
a
trifle
irritated
as
any
man
might
be
when
checked
in
the
full
flow
of
eloquence
i
turned
to
find
mildred
at
my
elbow
let
me
talk
to
him
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
perhaps
i
may
not
irritate
him
as
you
seem
to
very
well
i
said
jones
and
i
are
here
as
witnesses
and
i
folded
my
arms
in
an
attitude
not
perhaps
unpicturesque
quint
said
mildred
in
her
soft
agreeable
voice
and
actually
smiling
slightly
at
the
murderer
is
it
really
true
that
you
are
guilty
of
shedding
the
blood
of
professor
boomly
it
is
said
quint
coolly
she
seemed
rather
taken
aback
at
that
but
presently
recovered
her
equanimity
why
she
asked
gently
because
he
attempted
a
most
hellish
crime
yelled
quint
crime
she
asked
faintly
i
tell
you
he
wanted
the
carnegie
medal
and
he
knew
it
would
be
given
to
me
if
i
could
incubate
and
hatch
my
batch
of
silver
moon
butterfly
eggs
he
realised
well
enough
that
his
heliconian
eggs
were
not
as
valuable
as
my
silver
moon
eggs
so
first
he
sneaked
in
here
and
put
an
ichneumon
fly
in
my
and
next
he
stole
the
silver
moon
eggs
and
left
in
their
place
some
common
eggs
thinking
that
because
they
were
very
similar
i
would
not
notice
the
substitution
i
did
notice
it
i
charged
him
with
that
cataclysmic
outrage
he
laughed
we
came
into
personal
collision
he
chased
me
into
my
room
panting
breathless
with
rage
at
the
memory
of
the
morning
defeat
which
i
had
witnessed
quint
glared
at
me
for
a
moment
then
he
jerked
his
head
toward
mildred
as
soon
as
he
went
to
luncheon
boomly
i
mean
i
climbed
over
that
transom
and
dropped
into
this
room
i
had
been
hunting
for
ten
minutes
before
i
found
my
silver
moon
eggs
hidden
under
the
carpet
so
i
pocketed
them
climbed
back
over
the
transom
and
went
to
my
room
he
paused
dramatically
staring
from
one
to
another
of
us
boomly
was
there
he
said
slowly
where
asked
mildred
with
a
shudder
in
my
room
he
had
picked
the
lock
i
told
him
to
get
out
he
went
i
shouted
after
him
that
i
had
recovered
the
silver
moon
eggs
and
that
i
should
certainly
be
awarded
the
carnegie
medal
then
that
monster
in
human
form
laughed
a
horrible
laugh
avowing
himself
guilty
of
a
crime
still
more
hideous
than
the
theft
of
the
silver
moon
eggs
do
you
know
what
he
had
done
faltered
mildred
he
had
stolen
from
cold
storage
and
had
concealed
the
leaves
of
the
bimba
bush
brought
from
singapore
to
feed
the
silver
moon
caterpillars
what
boomly
had
done
and
my
silver
moon
eggs
had
already
begun
to
hatch
and
my
caterpillars
would
starve
his
voice
ended
in
a
yell
he
struggled
on
his
chair
until
it
nearly
upset

the
infuriated
entomologist
and
laid
a
firm
hand
on
his
shoulder

said

that
professor
boomly
has
not
concealed
these
bimba
leaves
on
his
own
person
quint
ceased
his
contortions
and
gaped
at
her
i
never
thought
of
that
he
said
what
have
you
done
with
him
she
asked
very
pale
i
tell
you
i
do
know
you
must
know
what
you
did
with
him
she
insisted
quint
shook
his
head
impatiently
apparently
preoccupied
with
other
thoughts
we
stood
watching
him
in
silence
until
he
looked
up
and
became
conscious
of
our
concentrated
gaze
my
caterpillars
are
starving
he
began
violently
i
have
anything
else
they
eat
they
feed
only
on
the
bimba
leaf
they
eat
anything
else
it
a
fact
that
they
wo
why
in
johore
where
they
came
from
they
travel
miles
over
the
ground
to
find
a
bimba
bush
what
exclaimed
mildred
certainly
miles

starve
sooner
than

anything
except
bimba
leaves
if

a
bush

twenty
miles

said
mildred
quietly
where
are
these
starving
caterpillars
in
a
glass
jar
in
my
pocket
here
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
for
the
girl
had
dexterously
slipped
the
glass
jar
from
his
coat
pocket
and
was
holding
it
up
to
the
light
inside
it
were
several
dozen
tiny
dark
caterpillars
some
resting
disconsolately
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
hungrily
travelling
over
the
bottom
in
pitiful
and
hopeless
quest
of
nourishment
heedless
of
the
shouts
and
threats
of
quint
the
girl
calmly
uncorked
the
jar
took
on
her
slender
forefinger
a
single
little
caterpillar
replaced
the
cork
and
kneeling
down
gently
disengaged
the
caterpillar
it
dropped
upon
the
floor
remained
motionless
for
a
moment
then
turning
began
to
travel
rapidly
toward
the
doorway
behind
us
now
she
said
if
poor
professor
boomly
really
has
concealed
these
bimba
leaves
upon
his
own
person
this
little
caterpillar
according
to
quint
is
certain
to
find
those
leaves
illustration
little
caterpillar
is
certain
to
find
those
leaves
overcome
with
excitement
and
admiration
for
this
intelligent
and
unusually
beautiful
girl
i
seized
her
hands
and
congratulated
her
murder
said
i
to
the
miserable
quint
will
out
this
infant
caterpillar
shall
lead
us
to
that
dark
and
secret
spot
where
you
had
hoped
to
conceal
the
horrid
evidence
of
your
guilt
three
things
have
undone
you
a
caterpillar
replete
with
mysterious
instinct
a
humble
bunch
of
bimba
leaves
and
the
marvellous
intelligence
of
this
young
and
lovely
girl
madman
your
hour
has
struck
he
looked
at
me
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
as
though
astonishment
had
left
him
unable
to
articulate
but
i
had
become
tired
of
his
violence
and
his
shouts
and
yells
so
i
asked
jones
for
his
handkerchief
and
before
quint
knew
what
i
was
up
to
i
had
tied
it
over
his
mouth
he
became
a
brilliant
purple
but
all
he
could
utter
was
a
furious
humming
buzzing
noise
meanwhile
jones
had
opened
the
door
the
little
caterpillar
followed
by
mildred
and
myself
continued
to
hustle
along
as
though
he
knew
quite
well
where
he
was
going
down
the
hallway
he
went
in
undulating
haste
past
my
door
we
all
following
in
silent
excitement
as
we
discovered
that
parallel
to
the
caterpillar
course
ran
a
gruesome
trail
of
blood
drops
and
when
the
little
creature
turned
and
made
straight
for
the
door
of
professor
farrago
our
revered
chief
the
excitement
among
us
was
terrific
the
caterpillar
halted
i
gently
tried
the
door
it
was
open
instantly
the
caterpillar
crossed
the
threshold
wriggling
forward
at
top
speed
we
followed
peering
fearfully
around
us
nobody
was
visible
could
quint
have
dragged
his
victim
here
by
heaven
he
had
for
the
caterpillar
was
travelling
straight
under
the
lounge
upon
which
professor
farrago
was
accustomed
to
repose
after
luncheon
and
dropping
on
one
knee
i
saw
a
fat
foot
partly
protruding
from
under
the
shirred
edges
of
the
fringed
drapery
he
there
i
whispered
in
an
awed
voice
to
the
others
courage
miss
case
try
not
to
faint
jones
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
that
same
odd
expression
then
he
went
over
to
where
she
stood
and
coolly
passed
one
arm
around
her
waist
try
not
to
faint
mildred
he
said
it
might
muss
your
hair
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
say
but
i
had
no
time
then
to
analyze
it
for
i
had
seized
the
fat
foot
which
partly
protruded
from
under
the
sofa
clad
in
a
congress
gaiter
and
a
white
sock
and
then
nearly
fainted
for
instead
of
the
dreadful
inert
resistance
of
lifeless
clay
the
foot
wriggled
and
tried
to
kick
at
me
help
came
a
thin
but
muffled
voice
help
help
in
the
name
of
heaven
boomly
i
cried
scarcely
believing
my
ears
take
that
man
away
smith
whimpered
boomly
he
a
devil
murder
me
he
made
my
nose
bleed
all
over
everything
boomly
you
dead
yes
i
am
he
whined
i
dead
enough
to
suit
me
keep
that
little
lunatic
off
that
all
i
ask
he
can
have
his
carnegie
medal
for
all
i
care
only
tie
him
up
somewhere
professor
boomly
cried
mildred
excitedly
have
you
any
bimba
leaves
concealed
about
your
person
yes
i
have
he
said
sulkily
there
came
a
hitch
of
the
fat
foot
a
heavy
scuffling
sound
heavy
panting
and
then
skittering
out
across
the
floor
came
a
flat
sealed
parcel
there
you
are
he
said
now
let
me
alone
until
that
fiend
has
gone
home
he
wo
attack
you
again
i
said
come
out
but
professor
boomly
flatly
declined
to
stir
i
looked
at
the
parcel
it
was
marked
bimba
leaves
johore
with
a
sigh
of
unutterable
relief
i
picked
up
the
ravenous
little
caterpillar
placed
him
on
the
packet
and
turned
to
go
and
did
it
is
a
very
sickening
fact
i
have
now
to
record
but
to
a
scientist
all
facts
are
sacred
sickening
or
otherwise
for
what
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
just
outside
the
door
in
the
hallway
was
jones
kissing
mildred
case
and
being
shyly
indemnified
for
his
trouble
with
a
gentle
return
in
kind
both
his
arms
were
around
her
waist
both
her
hands
rested
upon
his
shoulders
and
as
i
looked
but
let
it
pass
let
it
pass
deliberately
i
fished
in
my
pocket
found
my
packet
of
cigarettes
lighted
one
diffugiunt
mordaces
curae
et
laetificat
cor
hominis
