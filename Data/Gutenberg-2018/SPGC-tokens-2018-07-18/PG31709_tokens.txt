something
hidden
go
and
find
it
in
one
of
poe
minor
tales
written
in
there
is
a
vague
allusion
to
wild
mountains
in
western
virginia
tenanted
by
fierce
and
uncouth
races
of
men
this
so
far
as
i
know
was
the
first
reference
in
literature
to
our
southern
mountaineers
and
it
stood
as
their
only
characterization
until
miss
murfree
charles
egbert
craddock
began
her
stories
of
the
cumberland
hills
time
and
retouching
have
done
little
to
soften
our
portrait
among
reading
people
generally
south
as
well
as
north
to
name
him
is
to
conjure
up
a
tall
slouching
figure
in
homespun
who
carries
a
rifle
as
habitually
as
he
does
his
hat
and
who
may
tilt
its
muzzle
toward
a
stranger
before
addressing
him
the
form
of
salutation
being
stop
thar
whut
name
whar
ter
let
us
admit
that
there
is
just
enough
truth
in
this
caricature
to
give
it
a
point
that
will
stick
our
typical
mountaineer
is
lank
he
is
always
unkempt
he
is
fond
of
toting
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
his
curiosity
about
a
stranger
name
and
business
is
promptly
though
politely
outspoken
for
the
rest
he
is
a
man
of
mystery
the
great
world
outside
his
mountains
knows
almost
as
little
about
him
as
he
does
of
it
and
that
is
little
indeed
news
in
order
to
reach
him
must
be
of
such
widespread
interest
as
fairly
to
fall
from
heaven
correspondingly
scarce
any
incidents
of
mountain
life
will
leak
out
unless
they
be
of
sensational
nature
such
as
the
shooting
of
a
revenue
officer
in
carolina
the
massacre
of
a
virginia
court
or
the
outbreak
of
another
feud
in
bloody
breathitt
and
so
from
the
grim
sameness
of
such
reports
the
world
infers
that
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
are
commonplaces
in
appalachia
to
be
sure
in
miss
murfree
novels
as
in
those
of
john
fox
and
of
alice
macgowan
we
do
meet
characters
more
genial
than
feudists
and
illicit
distillers
none
the
less
when
we
have
closed
the
book
who
is
it
that
stands
out
clearest
as
type
and
pattern
of
the
mountaineer
is
it
not
he
of
the
long
rifle
and
peremptory
challenge
and
whether
this
be
because
he
gets
most
of
the
limelight
or
because
we
have
a
furtive
liking
for
that
sort
of
thing
on
paper
or
whether
the
armed
outlaw
be
indeed
a
genuine
protagonist
in
any
case
the
appalachian
people
remain
in
public
estimation
as
poe
judged
them
an
uncouth
and
fierce
race
of
men
inhabiting
a
wild
mountain
region
little
known
the
southern
highlands
themselves
are
a
mysterious
realm
when
i
prepared
eight
years
ago
for
my
first
sojourn
in
the
great
smoky
mountains
which
form
the
master
chain
of
the
appalachian
system
i
could
find
in
no
library
a
guide
to
that
region
the
most
diligent
research
failed
to
discover
so
much
as
a
magazine
article
written
within
this
generation
that
described
the
land
and
its
people
nay
there
was
not
even
a
novel
or
a
story
that
showed
intimate
local
knowledge
had
i
been
going
to
teneriffe
or
timbuctu
the
libraries
would
have
furnished
information
but
about
this
housetop
of
eastern
america
they
were
strangely
silent
it
was
on
the
map
i
could
see
that
the
southern
appalachians
cover
an
area
much
larger
than
new
england
and
that
they
are
nearer
the
center
of
our
population
than
any
other
mountains
that
deserve
the
name
why
then
so
little
known
quaintly
there
came
to
mind
those
lines
familiar
to
my
boyhood
get
you
up
this
way
southward
and
go
up
into
the
mountain
and
see
the
land
what
it
is
and
the
people
that
dwelleth
therein
whether
they
be
strong
or
weak
few
or
many
and
what
the
land
is
that
they
dwell
in
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
and
what
cities
they
be
that
they
dwell
in
whether
in
tents
or
in
strongholds
and
what
the
land
is
whether
it
be
fat
or
lean
whether
there
be
wood
therein
or
not
in
that
dustiest
room
of
a
great
library
where
pub
docs
are
stored
i
unearthed
a
government
report
on
forestry
that
gave
at
last
a
clear
idea
of
the
lay
of
the
land
and
here
was
news
we
are
wont
to
think
of
the
south
as
a
low
country
with
sultry
climate
yet
its
mountain
chains
stretch
uninterruptedly
southwestward
from
virginia
to
alabama
miles
in
an
air
line
they
spread
over
parts
of
eight
contiguous
states
and
cover
an
area
somewhat
larger
than
england
and
scotland
or
about
the
same
as
that
of
the
alps
in
short
the
greatest
mountain
system
of
eastern
america
is
massed
in
our
southland
in
its
upper
zone
one
sleeps
under
blankets
the
year
round
in
all
the
region
north
of
virginia
and
east
of
the
black
hills
of
dakota
there
is
but
one
summit
mount
washington
in
new
hampshire
that
reaches
feet
above
sea
level
and
there
are
only
a
dozen
others
that
exceed
feet
by
contrast
south
of
the
potomac
there
are
peaks
and
miles
of
dividing
ridges
that
rise
above
feet
besides
mountains
and
some
miles
of
divide
that
stand
more
than
feet
above
the
sea
in
north
carolina
alone
the
mountains
cover
square
miles
with
an
elevation
of
feet
and
with
peaks
that
overtop
mount
washington
i
repeated
to
myself
why
then
so
little
known
the
alps
and
the
rockies
the
pyrennees
and
the
harz
are
more
familiar
to
the
american
people
in
print
and
picture
if
not
by
actual
visit
than
are
the
black
the
balsam
and
the
great
smoky
mountains
it
is
true
that
summer
tourists
flock
to
asheville
and
toxaway
linville
and
highlands
passing
their
time
at
modern
hotels
and
motoring
along
a
few
macadamed
roads
but
what
do
they
see
of
the
billowy
wilderness
that
conceals
most
of
the
native
homes
glimpses
from
afar
what
do
they
learn
of
the
real
mountaineer
hearsay
for
mark
you
of
the
appalachian
population
are
a
sequestered
folk
the
typical
the
average
mountain
man
prefers
his
native
hills
and
his
primitive
ancient
ways
we
read
more
and
talk
more
about
the
filipinos
see
more
of
the
chinese
and
the
syrians
than
of
these
three
million
americans
who
are
of
colonial
ancestry
and
mostly
of
british
stock
new
york
we
say
is
a
cosmopolitan
city
more
irish
than
in
dublin
more
germans
than
in
munich
more
italians
than
in
rome
more
jews
than
in
nine
jerusalems
but
how
many
new
yorkers
ever
saw
a
southern
mountaineer
i
am
sure
that
a
party
of
hillsmen
fresh
from
the
back
settlements
of
the
unakas
if
dropped
on
the
streets
of
any
large
city
in
the
union
and
left
to
their
own
guidance
would
stir
up
more
comment
and
probably
more
trouble
than
would
a
similar
body
of
whites
from
any
other
quarter
of
the
earth
and
yet
this
same
odd
people
is
more
purely
bred
from
old
american
stock
than
any
other
element
of
our
population
that
occupies
by
itself
so
great
a
territory
the
mountaineers
of
the
south
are
marked
apart
from
all
other
folks
by
dialect
by
customs
by
character
by
isolation
so
true
is
this
that
they
call
all
outsiders
furriners
it
matters
not
whether
your
descent
be
from
puritan
or
cavalier
whether
you
come
from
boston
or
chicago
savannah
or
new
orleans
in
the
mountains
you
are
a
furriner
a
traveler
puzzled
and
scandalized
at
this
asked
a
native
of
the
cumberlands
what
he
would
call
a
dutchman
or
a
dago
the
fellow
studied
a
bit
and
then
replied
them
the
outlandish
illustration
a
family
of
pioneers
in
the
twentieth
century
foreigner
outlander
it
is
all
one
we
are
different
we
are
quar
to
the
mountaineer
he
knows
he
is
an
american
but
his
conception
of
the
metes
and
bounds
of
america
is
vague
to
the
vanishing
point
as
for
countries
well
when
a
celebrated
nebraskan
returned
from
his
trip
around
the
globe
one
of
my
backwoods
neighbors
proudly
informed
me
i
see
they
give
bryan
a
lot
of
receptions
when
he
kem
back
from
the
other
world
no
one
can
understand
the
attitude
of
our
highlanders
toward
the
rest
of
the
earth
until
he
realizes
their
amazing
isolation
from
all
that
lies
beyond
the
blue
hazy
skyline
of
their
mountains
conceive
a
shipload
of
emigrants
cast
away
on
some
unknown
island
far
from
the
regular
track
of
vessels
and
left
there
for
five
or
six
generations
unaided
and
untroubled
by
the
growth
of
civilization
among
the
descendants
of
such
a
company
we
would
expect
to
find
customs
and
ideas
unaltered
from
the
time
of
their
forefathers
and
that
is
just
what
we
do
find
among
our
castaways
in
the
sea
of
mountains
time
has
lingered
in
appalachia
the
mountain
folk
still
live
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
progress
of
mankind
from
that
age
to
this
is
no
heritage
of
theirs
our
backwoodsmen
of
the
blue
ridge
and
the
unakas
of
their
connecting
chains
and
of
the
outlying
cumberlands
are
still
thinking
essentially
the
same
thoughts
still
living
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
did
their
ancestors
in
the
days
of
daniel
boone
nor
is
this
their
fault
they
are
a
people
of
keen
intelligence
and
strong
initiative
when
they
can
see
anything
to
win
but
as
president
frost
says
they
have
been
beleaguered
by
nature
they
are
belated
ghettoed
in
the
midst
of
a
civilization
that
is
as
aloof
from
them
as
if
it
existed
only
on
another
planet
and
so
in
order
to
be
fair
and
just
with
these
our
backward
kinsmen
we
must
for
the
time
decivilize
ourselves
to
the
extent
of
and
getting
an
eighteenth
century
point
of
view
but
first
how
comes
it
that
the
mountain
folk
have
been
so
long
detached
from
the
life
and
movement
of
their
times
why
are
they
so
foreign
to
americanism
that
they
innocently
call
all
the
rest
of
us
foreigners
the
answer
lies
on
the
map
they
are
creatures
of
environment
enmeshed
in
a
labyrinth
that
has
deflected
and
repelled
the
march
of
our
nation
for
three
hundred
years
in
when
colonel
william
byrd
of
westover
was
running
the
boundary
line
between
virginia
and
north
carolina
he
finally
was
repulsed
by
parallel
chains
of
savage
unpeopled
mountains
that
rose
tier
beyond
tier
to
the
westward
everywhere
densely
forested
and
matted
into
jungle
by
laurel
and
other
undergrowth
in
his
writing
in
the
quaint
way
he
said
our
country
has
now
been
inhabited
more
than
years
by
the
english
and
still
we
hardly
know
anything
of
the
appalachian
mountains
that
are
nowhere
above
miles
from
the
sea
whereas
the
french
who
are
later
comers
have
rang
from
quebec
southward
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
mississippi
in
the
bay
of
mexico
and
to
the
west
almost
as
far
as
california
which
is
either
way
above
miles
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
later
the
same
thing
could
have
been
said
of
these
same
mountains
for
the
fierce
and
uncouth
races
of
men
that
poe
faintly
heard
of
remained
practically
undiscovered
until
they
startled
the
nation
on
the
scene
of
our
civil
war
by
sending
of
their
riflemen
into
the
union
army
if
a
corps
of
surveyors
should
be
engaged
to
run
a
line
due
west
from
eastern
virginia
to
the
blue
grass
of
kentucky
they
would
have
an
arduous
task
let
us
suppose
that
they
start
from
near
richmond
and
proceed
along
the
line
of
the
blue
ridge
is
not
especially
difficult
only
eight
transverse
ridges
to
climb
up
and
down
in
fourteen
miles
and
none
of
them
more
than
feet
high
from
bottom
to
top
then
thirteen
miles
across
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
a
curious
formation
begins
as
a
foretaste
in
the
three
and
a
half
miles
crossing
little
house
and
big
house
mountains
one
ascends
feet
descends
climbs
again
and
goes
down
feet
on
the
far
side
beyond
lie
steep
and
narrow
ridges
athwart
the
way
paralleling
each
other
like
waves
at
sea
ten
distinct
mountain
chains
are
scaled
and
descended
in
the
next
forty
miles
there
are
few
leads
rising
gradually
to
their
crests
each
and
every
one
of
these
ridges
is
a
chinese
wall
magnified
to
altitudes
of
from
a
thousand
to
two
thousand
feet
and
covered
with
thicket
the
hollows
between
them
are
merely
deep
troughs
in
the
next
thirty
miles
we
come
upon
novel
topography
instead
of
wave
following
wave
in
orderly
procession
we
find
here
a
choppy
sea
of
small
mountains
with
hollows
running
toward
all
points
of
the
compass
instead
of
chinese
walls
we
now
have
chinese
puzzles
the
innate
perversity
of
such
configuration
grows
more
and
more
exasperating
as
we
toil
westward
in
the
two
hundred
miles
from
the
greenbrier
to
the
kentucky
river
the
ridges
are
all
but
unscalable
and
the
streams
sprangle
in
every
direction
like
branches
of
mountain
laurel
the
only
roads
follow
the
beds
of
tortuous
and
water
courses
which
may
be
nearly
dry
when
you
start
out
in
the
morning
but
within
an
hour
may
be
raging
torrents
there
are
no
bridges
one
may
ford
a
dozen
times
in
a
mile
a
spring
tide
will
stop
all
travel
even
from
neighbor
to
neighbor
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
buggies
and
carriages
are
unheard
of
in
many
districts
the
only
means
of
transportation
is
with
saddlebags
on
horseback
or
with
a
tow
sack
afoot
if
the
pedestrian
tries
a
he
will

james
lane
allen
was
not
writing
fiction
when
he
said
of
the
wilderness
road
into
kentucky
despite
all
that
has
been
done
to
civilize
it
since
boone
traced
its
course
in
this
honored
historic
thoroughfare
remains
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
with
all
its
sloughs
and
sands
its
mud
and
holes
and
jutting
ledges
of
rock
and
loose
boulders
and
twists
and
turns
and
general
total
depravity
one
such
road
was
enough
they
are
said
to
have
been
notorious
for
profanity
those
who
came
into
kentucky
from
this
side
naturally
many
were
infidels
there
are
roads
that
make
a
man
lose
faith
it
is
known
that
the
more
pious
companies
of
them
as
they
traveled
along
would
now
and
then
give
up
in
despair
sit
down
raise
a
hymn
and
have
prayers
before
they
could
go
further
perhaps
one
of
the
provocations
to
homicide
among
the
mountain
people
should
be
reckoned
this
road
i
have
seen
two
of
the
mildest
of
men
after
riding
over
it
for
a
few
hours
lose
their
temper
and
begin
to
fight
fight
their
horses
fight
the
flies
fight
the
cobwebs
on
their
noses
such
difficulties
of
intercommunication
are
enough
to
explain
the
isolation
of
the
mountaineers
in
the
more
remote
regions
this
loneliness
reaches
a
degree
almost
unbelievable
miss
ellen
semple
in
a
fine
monograph
published
in
the
of
london
in
gave
us
some
examples
these
kentucky
mountaineers
are
not
only
cut
off
from
the
outside
world
but
they
are
separated
from
each
other
each
is
confined
to
his
own
locality
and
finds
his
little
world
within
a
radius
of
a
few
miles
from
his
cabin
there
are
many
men
in
these
mountains
who
have
never
seen
a
town
or
even
the
poor
village
that
constitutes
their
the
women
are
almost
as
rooted
as
the
trees
we
met
one
woman
who
during
the
twelve
years
of
her
married
life
had
lived
only
ten
miles
across
the
mountain
from
her
own
home
but
had
never
in
this
time
been
back
home
to
visit
her
father
and
mother
another
back
in
perry
county
told
me
she
had
never
been
farther
from
home
than
hazard
the
which
is
only
six
miles
distant
another
had
never
been
to
the
four
miles
away
and
another
had
never
seen
the
ford
of
the
rockcastle
river
only
two
miles
from
her
home
and
marked
moreover
by
the
country
store
of
the
district
when
i
first
went
into
the
smokies
i
stopped
one
night
in
a
log
cabin
and
soon
had
the
good
people
absorbed
in
my
tales
of
travel
beyond
the
seas
finally
the
housewife
said
to
me
with
pathetic
resignation
bushnell
the
furdest
ever
i
been
bushnell
at
that
time
was
a
hamlet
of
thirty
people
only
seven
miles
from
where
we
sat
when
i
lived
alone
on
the
little
fork
of
sugar
fork
of
hazel
creek
there
were
women
in
the
neighborhood
young
and
old
who
had
never
seen
a
railroad
and
men
who
had
never
boarded
a
train
although
the
murphy
branch
ran
within
sixteen
miles
of
our
the
first
time
that
a
party
of
these
people
went
to
the
railroad
they
were
uneasy
and
suspicious
nearing
the
a
girl
in
advance
came
upon
the
first
negro
she
ever
saw
in
her
life
and
ran
screaming
back
my
goddamighty
mam
thar
the
boogerman
i
done
seed
him
but
before
discussing
the
mountain
people
and
their
problems
let
us
take
an
imaginary
balloon
voyage
over
their
vast
domain
south
of
the
potomac
the
blue
ridge
is
a
narrow
rampart
rising
abruptly
from
the
east
one
or
two
thousand
feet
above
its
base
and
descending
sharply
to
the
shenandoah
valley
on
the
west
across
the
valley
begin
the
alleghanies
these
mountains
from
the
potomac
through
to
the
northern
tennessee
border
consist
of
a
multitude
of
narrow
ridges
with
steep
escarpment
on
both
sides
running
southwesterly
in
parallel
chains
and
each
chain
separated
from
its
neighbors
by
deep
slender
dales
wherever
one
goes
westward
from
the
valley
he
will
encounter
tier
after
tier
of
these
ridges
as
i
have
already
described
illustration
photo
by
forest
service
the
very
cliffs
are
sheathed
with
trees
and
shrubs
linville
river
and
falls
the
walls
of
one
gorge
are
from
to
feet
high
as
a
rule
the
links
in
each
chain
can
be
passed
by
following
small
gaps
but
often
one
must
make
very
wide
detours
for
example
pine
mountain
every
link
has
its
own
distinct
name
is
practically
impassable
for
nearly
miles
except
for
two
water
gaps
and
five
difficult
crossings
although
it
averages
only
a
mile
thick
the
people
on
its
north
side
generally
know
less
about
those
on
the
south
than
a
maine
yankee
does
about
pennsylvania
dutchmen
the
alleghanies
together
have
a
width
of
from
forty
to
sixty
miles
westward
of
them
for
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
are
the
labyrinthine
roughs
of
west
virginia
and
eastern
kentucky
in
southwestern
virginia
the
blue
ridge
and
the
alleghanies
coalesce
but
soon
spread
apart
again
the
blue
ridge
retaining
its
name
as
well
as
its
general
character
although
much
loftier
and
more
massive
than
in
the
north
the
southeast
front
of
the
blue
ridge
is
a
steep
escarpment
rising
abruptly
from
the
piedmont
plateau
of
carolina
not
one
river
cuts
through
the
ridge
notwithstanding
that
the
mountains
to
the
westward
are
higher
and
much
more
massive
it
is
the
watershed
of
this
whole
mountain
region
the
streams
rising
on
its
northwestern
front
flow
down
into
central
plateaus
and
thence
cut
their
way
through
the
unakas
in
deep
and
precipitous
gorges
draining
finally
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
through
the
tennessee
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers
the
northwestern
range
which
corresponds
to
the
alleghanies
of
virginia
now
assumes
a
character
entirely
different
from
them
instead
of
parallel
chains
of
low
ridges
we
have
here
on
the
border
of
north
carolina
and
tennessee
a
single
chain
that
dwarfs
all
others
in
the
appalachian
system
it
is
cut
into
segments
by
the
rivers
nolichucky
french
broad
pigeon
little
tennessee
hiwassee
that
drain
the
interior
plateaus
and
each
segment
has
a
distinct
name
of
its
own
iron
northern
unaka
bald
great
smoky
southern
unaka
or
unicoi
mountains
the
carolina
mountaineers
still
call
this
system
collectively
the
alleghanies
but
the
geological
survey
has
given
it
a
more
distinctive
name
the
unakas
while
the
blue
ridge
has
only
seven
peaks
that
rise
above
feet
the
unakas
have
summits
exceeding
and
ten
that
are
over
feet
connecting
the
unaka
chain
with
the
blue
ridge
are
several
transverse
ranges
the
stone
beech
roan
yellow
black
newfound
pisgah
balsam
cowee
nantahala
tusquitee
and
a
few
minor
mountains
which
as
a
whole
are
much
higher
than
the
blue
ridge
summits
rising
over
feet
and
over
feet
above
in
northern
georgia
the
unakas
and
the
blue
ridge
gradually
fade
away
into
straggling
ridges
and
foothills
which
extend
into
small
parts
of
south
carolina
and
alabama
the
cumberland
plateau
is
not
attached
to
either
of
these
mountain
systems
but
is
rather
a
prolongation
of
the
roughs
of
eastern
kentucky
it
is
separated
from
the
unakas
by
the
broad
valley
of
the
tennessee
river
the
plateau
rises
very
abruptly
from
the
surrounding
plains
it
consists
mainly
of
tableland
gashed
by
streams
that
have
cut
their
way
down
in
deep
narrow
gulches
with
precipitous
sides
most
of
the
literature
about
our
southern
mountaineers
refers
only
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
comparatively
meagre
hills
of
eastern
kentucky
or
to
the
cumberlands
of
tennessee
little
has
been
written
about
the
real
mountaineers
of
southwestern
virginia
western
north
carolina
and
the
extreme
north
of
georgia
the
great
mountain
masses
still
await
their
annalist
their
artist

some
places

jane
barlow
says
in

if
you
inquire
the
address
of
such
or
such
person
you
will
hear
not
very
infrequently
that
he
or
she
lives
away
at
the
back
of
a
traveler
to
the
back
of

consider

at

by
any
mode
of
conveyance
other
than
two
standin

of
him
often
enough
the
last
stage
of
his
journey
proceeds
down
some
boggy
or
up
some
craggy
inaccessible
to
any
wheel
or

that
ever
was
shod
so
in
appalachia
one
steps
shortly
from
the
railway
into
the
primitive
most
of
the
river
valleys
are
narrow
in
their
bottoms
the
soil
is
rich
the
farms
well
kept
and
generous
the
owners
comfortable
and
urbane
but
from
the
valleys
directly
spring
the
mountains
with
slopes
rising
twenty
to
forty
degrees
or
more
these
mountains
cover
of
western
north
carolina
and
among
them
dwell
a
majority
of
the
native
people
the
back
country
is
rough
no
boat
nor
canoe
can
stem
its
brawling
waters
no
bicycle
nor
automobile
can
enter
it
no
coach
can
endure
its
roads
here
is
a
land
of
lumber
wagons
and
and
shackly
little
sleds
that
are
dragged
over
the
bare
ground
by
harnessed
steers
this
is
the
country
that
ordinary
tourists
shun
and
well
for
such
that
they
do
since
whoso
cares
more
for
bodily
comfort
than
for
freedom
and
air
and
should
tarry
by
still
waters
and
pleasant
pastures
to
him
the
backwoods
could
be
only
what
burns
called
argyleshire
a
country
where
savage
streams
tumble
over
savage
mountains
thinly
overspread
with
savage
flocks
which
starvingly
support
as
savage
inhabitants
when
i
went
south
into
the
mountains
i
was
seeking
a
back
of
beyond
this
for
more
reasons
than
one
with
an
inborn
taste
for
the
wild
and
romantic
i
yearned
for
a
strange
land
and
a
people
that
had
the
charm
of
originality
again
i
had
a
passion
for
early
american
history
and
in
far
appalachia
it
seemed
that
i
might
realize
the
past
in
the
present
seeing
with
my
own
eyes
what
life
must
have
been
to
my
pioneer
ancestors
of
a
century
or
two
ago
besides
i
wanted
to
enjoy
a
free
life
in
the
open
air
the
thrill
of
exploring
new
ground
the
joys
of
the
chase
and
the
man
game
of
matching
my
woodcraft
against
the
forces
of
nature
with
no
help
from
servants
or
hired
guides
so
casting
about
for
a
biding
place
that
would
fill
such
needs
i
picked
out
the
upper
settlement
of
hazel
creek
far
up
under
the
lee
of
those
smoky
mountains
that
i
had
learned
so
little
about
on
the
edge
of
this
settlement
scant
two
miles
from
the
of
medlin
there
was
a
copper
mine
long
disused
on
account
of
litigation
and
i
got
permission
to
occupy
one
of
its
abandoned
cabins
a
mountain
settlement
consists
of
all
who
get
their
mail
at
the
same
place
ours
was
made
up
of
households
about
two
hundred
souls
scattered
over
an
area
eight
miles
long
by
two
wide
these
are
measurements
all
roads
and
trails
wiggled
and
wingled
around
so
that
some
families
were
several
miles
from
a
neighbor
fifteen
homes
had
no
wagon
road
and
could
be
reached
by
no
vehicle
other
than
a
narrow
sled
quill
rose
had
not
even
a
sledpath
but
journeyed
full
five
miles
by
trail
to
the
nearest
wagon
road
medlin
itself
comprised
two
little
stores
built
of
rough
planks
and
bearing
no
signs
a
corn
mill
and
four
dwellings
a
mile
and
a
half
away
was
the
log
schoolhouse
which
once
or
twice
a
month
served
also
as
church
scattered
about
the
settlement
were
seven
tiny
for
grinding
corn
some
of
them
mere
open
sheds
with
a
capacity
of
about
a
bushel
a
day
most
of
the
dwellings
were
built
of
logs
two
or
three
only
were
weatherboarded
frame
houses
and
attained
the
dignity
of
a
story
and
a
half
all
about
us
was
the
forest
primeval
where
roamed
some
sparse
herds
of
cattle
razorback
hogs
and
the
wild
beasts
speckled
trout
were
in
all
the
streams
bears
sometimes
raided
the
fields
and
wildcats
were
a
common
nuisance
our
settlement
was
a
mere
slash
in
the
vast
woodland
that
encompassed
it
the
occupied
a
space
about
five
feet
square
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
stores
there
was
a
daily
mail
by
rider
serving
four
other
communities
along
the
way
the
contractor
for
this
service
had
to
furnish
two
horses
working
turnabout
pay
the
rider
and
squeeze
his
own
profit
out
of
a
year
in
star
route
days
the
mail
was
carried
afoot
two
barefooted
young
men
toting
the
sacks
on
their
own
wethers
over
this
round
trip
for
cents
a
day
and
they
boarded
themselves
in
the
group
that
gathered
at
mail
time
i
often
was
solicited
to
back
envelopes
give
out
the
news
or
decipher
letters
for
men
who
could
not
read
several
times
in
the
postmaster
absence
i
registered
letters
for
myself
or
for
someone
else
the
law
of
the
nation
being
suspended
by
general
consent
our
stores
as
i
have
said
were
small
yet
many
of
their
shelves
were
empty
oftentimes
there
was
no
flour
to
be
had
no
meat
cereals
canned
goods
coffee
sugar
or
oil
it
excited
no
comment
at
all
when
old
pete
would
lean
across
his
bare
counter
and
lament
that
thar
lots
o
folks
around
hyur
for
lard
and
i
ai
got
none
i
have
seen
the
time
when
our
neighborhood
could
get
no
salt
nor
tobacco
without
making
a
trip
over
the
mountain
and
back
in
the
dead
of
winter
this
was
due
partly
to
the
state
of
the
roads
and
to
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
wagon
available
for
weeks
at
a
time
wagoning
by
the
way
was
no
sinecure
often
it
meant
to
chop
a
fallen
tree
out
of
the
road
and
then
with
handspikes
the
log
outen
the
way
sometimes
an
axle
would
break
far
upon
the
mountain
of
course
then
a
tree
must
be
felled
and
a
new
axle
made
on
the
spot
from
the
green
wood
with
no
tools
but
axe
and
jackknife
illustration
at
the
trade
was
mostly
by
barter
in
which
skins
and
ginseng
had
the
same
rank
as
in
the
days
of
davy
crockett
and
daniel
boone
long
credits
were
given
on
anticipated
crops
but
the
risks
were
great
and
the
market
limited
by
local
consumption
as
it
did
not
pay
to
haul
bulky
commodities
to
the
railroad
hence
it
was
for
the
storekeepers
to
carry
only
a
slender
stock
of
essentials
and
take
pains
to
have
little
left
through
unproductive
times
as
a
rule
credit
would
not
be
asked
so
long
as
anything
at
all
could
be
offered
in
trade
when
bill
took
the
last
quart
of
meal
from
the
house
as
rations
for
a
bear
hunt
his
patient
marg
walked
five
miles
to
the
store
with
a
skinny
old
chicken
last
of
the
flock
and
offered
to
barter
it
for
a
dustin
o
salt
there
was
not
a
bite
in
her
house
beyond
potatoes
and
do
go
good
salt
in
our
primitive
community
there
were
no
trades
no
professions
every
man
was
his
own
farmer
blacksmith
gunsmith
carpenter
cobbler
miller
tinker
someone
in
his
family
or
a
near
neighbor
served
him
as
barber
and
dentist
and
would
make
him
a
coffin
when
he
died
one
farmer
was
also
the
wagoner
of
the
district
as
well
as
storekeeper
magistrate
veterinarian
and
accoucheur
he
also
owned
the
only
in
the
settlement
a
pair
of
universal
forceps
that
he
designed
forged
filed
out
and
wielded
with
barbaric
grit
his
wife
kept
the
only
for
leagues
around
truly
an
accomplished
couple
about
of
our
householders
owned
their
homes
of
the
remainder
about
were
renters
and
were
squatters
in
the
sense
that
these
last
were
permitted
to
occupy
ground
for
the
sake
of
reporting
trespass
and
putting
out
fires
or
maybe
to
prevent
them
doing
both
nearly
all
of
the
wild
land
belonged
to
northern
timber
companies
who
had
not
yet
begun
operations
they
have
done
so
within
the
past
three
years
titles
were
confused
owing
to
careless
surveys
or
guesswork
in
the
past
many
boundaries
overlapped
and
there
were
bits
of
land
here
and
there
covered
by
no
deed
and
subject
to
entry
by
anyone
who
discovered
them
our
old
frontier
always
was
notorious
for
surveys
and
neglect
to
make
legal
entry
of
claims
thus
boone
lost
the
fairest
parts
of
the
kentucky
he
founded
and
was
ejected
and
sent
adrift
in
our
own
time
overlapping
boundaries
have
led
to
bitter
litigation
and
murderous
feuds
as
our
territory
was
sparsely
occupied
there
were
none
of
those
perpendicular
farms
so
noticeable
in
older
settlements
near
the
river
valleys
where
men
plow
fields
as
steep
as
their
own
house
roofs
and
till
with
the
hoe
many
an
acre
that
is
steeper
still
john
fox
tells
of
a
kentucky
farmer
who
fell
out
of
his
own
cornfield
and
broke
his
neck
i
have
seen
fields
in
carolina
where
this
might
occur
as
where
a
degree
slope
is
tilled
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
a
woman
told
me
i
hoed
corn
many
a
time
on
my
knees
yes
i
have
and
another
many
the
hill
o
corn
i
propped
up
with
a
rock
to
keep
it
from
fallin
even
in
our
new
region
many
of
the
fields
suffered
quickly
from
erosion
when
a
forest
is
cleared
there
is
a
spongy
humus
on
the
ground
surface
that
is
extremely
rich
but
this
washes
away
in
a
single
season
the
soil
beneath
is
good
but
thin
on
the
hillsides
and
its
soluble
fertile
ingredients
soon
leach
out
and
vanish
without
terracing
which
i
have
never
seen
practiced
in
the
mountains
of
the
south
no
field
with
a
surface
slope
of
more
than
ten
degrees
about
two
feet
in
ten
will
last
more
than
a
few
years
as
one
of
my
neighbors
put
it
thar
me
a
patch
and
grubbed
hit
out
now
i
can
raise
me
two
or
three
severe
craps
then
what
i
asked
when
corn
wo
grow
no
more
i
can
turn
the
field
into
grass
a
couple
o
years
then
you
rotate
and
grow
corn
again
la
no
by
that
time
the
land
will
be
so
poor
hit
would
raise
a
but
then
you
must
move
and
begin
all
over
again
this
continual
moving
must
be
a
great
nuisance
he
rolled
his
quid
and
placidly
answered
when
i
move
all
i
haffter
do
is
put
out
the
fire
and
call
the
dog
his
apparent
indifference
was
only
philosophy
expressed
with
sardonic
humor
just
as
another
neighbor
would
say
this
is
good
strong
land
or
it
would
hold
up
all
the
rocks
there
is
around
hyur
right
here
is
the
basis
for
much
of
what
strangers
call
shiftlessness
among
the
mountaineers
but
of
that
more
anon
in
other
chapters
in
clearing
new
ground
everyone
followed
the
ancient
custom
of
girdling
the
tree
trunks
and
letting
them
stand
in
spectral
ugliness
until
they
rotted
and
fell
this
is
a
quick
and
easy
way
to
get
rid
of
the
shade
that
otherwise
would
stunt
the
crops
and
it
prevents
such
trees
as
chestnut
buckeye
and
basswood
from
sprouting
from
the
stumps
in
the
fields
stood
scores
of
gigantic
hemlocks
deadened
that
never
would
be
used
even
for
fuel
save
as
their
bark
furnished
the
women
with
in
wet
weather
no
one
dreamt
that
hemlock
ever
would
be
marketable
and
this
was
only
five
years
ago
the
tillage
was
as
rude
and
destructive
as
anything
we
read
of
in
pioneer
history
the
common
plow
was
a
which
has
aptly
been
described
as
hardly
more
than
a
sharpened
stick
with
a
metal
rim
the
harrows
were
of
wood
throughout
with
locust
teeth
a
friend
and
i
made
one
from
the
green
trees
in
half
a
day
and
it
lasted
three
seasons
on
rocky
ground
sometimes
no
harrow
was
used
at
all
the
plowed
ground
being
drug
with
a
big
evergreen
bough
this
needed
only
to
be
withed
directly
to
a
pony
tail
as
they
used
to
do
in
ancient
ireland
and
the
picture
of
prehistoric
agriculture
would
have
been
complete
after
the
corn
was
up
all
cultivating
was
done
with
the
hoe
for
this
the
entire
family
turned
out
the
toddlers
being
left
to
play
in
the
furrows
while
their
mother
toiled
like
a
man
corn
was
the
staple
crop
in
fact
the
only
crop
of
most
farmers
some
rye
was
raised
along
the
creek
and
a
little
oats
but
our
settlement
grew
no
wheat
there
was
no
mill
that
could
grind
it
wheat
is
raised
to
some
extent
in
the
river
bottoms
and
on
the
plateaus
of
the
interior
i
have
seen
it
flailed
out
on
the
bare
ground
and
winnowed
by
pouring
the
grain
and
chaff
from
basket
to
basket
while
the
women
fluttered
aprons
or
corn
is
topped
for
the
the
ears
gathered
from
the
stalk
and
the
main
stalks
afterwards
used
as
roughness
roughage
the
cribs
generally
are
ramshackle
pens
and
there
is
much
waste
from
mold
and
vermin
the
carolina
mountains
are
by
nature
one
of
the
best
fruit
regions
in
eastern
america
apples
grapes
and
berries
especially
thrive
exceeding
well
but
our
mountaineer
is
no
horticulturist
he
lets
his
fruit
trees
take
care
of
themselves
and
so
everywhere
except
on
select
farms
near
the
towns
we
see
old
apple
and
peach
trees
that
never
were
pruned
bristling
with
shoots
and
often
bearing
wizened
fruit
dry
and
bitter
or
half
rotted
on
the
stem
so
too
the
gardens
are
slighted
late
in
the
season
our
average
garden
is
a
miniature
jungle
chiefly
of
weeds
that
stand
high
as
one
head
cabbage
and
field
beans
survive
and
figure
mightily
in
the
diet
of
the
mountaineer
potatoes
generally
do
well
but
few
farmers
raise
enough
to
see
them
through
the
winter
generally
some
tobacco
is
grown
for
family
consumption
the
strong
twist
being
smoked
or
chewed
indifferently
an
interesting
crop
in
our
neighborhood
was
ginseng
of
which
there
were
several
patches
in
cultivation
this
curious
plant
is
native
throughout
the
appalachians
but
has
been
exterminated
in
all
but
the
wildest
regions
on
account
of
the
high
price
that
its
dried
root
brings
it
has
long
since
passed
out
of
our
pharmacopoeia
and
is
marketed
only
in
china
though
our
own
people
formerly
esteemed
it
as
a
panacea
for
all
ills
of
the
flesh
colonel
byrd
in
his
history
of
the
dividing
line
says
of
it
though
practice
wilt
soon
make
a
man
of
tolerable
vigour
an
able
footman
yet
as
a
help
to
bear
fatigue
i
us
to
chew
a
root
of
ginseng
as
i
along
this
kept
up
my
spirits
and
made
me
trip
away
as
nimbly
in
my
half
as
younger
men
cou
in
their
shoes
this
plant
is
in
high
esteem
in
china
where
it
sells
for
its
weight
in
silver
its
vertues
are
that
it
gives
an
uncommon
warmth
and
vigour
to
the
blood
and
frisks
the
spirits
beyond
any
other
cordial
it
chears
the
heart
even
of
a
man
that
has
a
bad
wife
and
makes
him
look
down
with
great
composure
on
the
crosses
of
the
world
it
promotes
insensible
perspiration
dissolves
all
phlegmatick
and
viscous
humours
that
are
apt
to
obstruct
the
narrow
channels
of
the
nerves
it
helps
the
memory
and
would
quicken
even
helvetian
dullness
is
friendly
to
the
lungs
much
more
than
scolding
itself
it
comforts
the
stomach
and
strengthens
the
bowels
preventing
all
colicks
and
fluxes
in
one
word
it
will
make
a
man
live
a
great
while
and
very
well
while
he
does
live
and
what
is
more
it
will
even
make
old
age
amiable
by
rendering
it
lively
chearful
and
alas
that
only
chinamen
and
cavaliers
could
absorb
the
virtues
of
this
sovereign
herb
a
successful
ginseng
grower
of
our
settlement
told
me
that
two
acres
of
the
plant
will
bring
an
income
of
to
a
year
planting
to
the
acre
the
roots
take
eight
years
to
mature
they
weigh
from
one
and
a
half
to
four
ounces
each
when
fresh
and
of
this
dried
two
acres
produce
roots
a
year
by
progression
the
dried
root
at
that
time
brought
five
dollars
a
pound
at
present
i
believe
it
is
higher
another
friend
of
mine
who
is
in
this
business
extensively
tried
exporting
for
himself
but
got
only
a
pound
in
amoy
when
the
consul
at
that
port
assured
him
that
the
real
market
price
was
from
to
the
local
trader
knowing
american
prices
pocketed
the
difference
illustration
the
author
in
camp
in
the
big
smokies
in
times
of
scarcity
many
of
our
people
took
to
the
woods
and
gathered
commoner
medicinal
roots
such
as
bloodroot
and
wild
ginger
there
are
scores
of
others
growing
wild
in
great
profusion
but
made
only
a
pittance
at
it
as
synthetic
drugs
have
mostly
taken
the
place
of
herbal
simples
in
modern
medicine
women
and
children
did
better
in
the
days
before
christmas
by
gathering
galax
hemlock
and
mistletoe
selling
to
the
dealers
at
the
railroad
who
ship
them
north
for
holiday
decorations
one
bright
lad
from
town
informed
me
with
evident
pride
of
geography
that
some
of
this
goes
to
london
england
nearly
everywhere
in
our
woods
the
beautiful
galax
is
abundant
along
the
which
similarly
turns
bronze
in
autumn
and
lasts
throughout
the
winter
is
so
prolific
as
to
be
a
nuisance
to
travelers
being
hard
to
push
through
most
of
our
farmers
had
neither
horse
nor
mule
for
the
rough
work
of
cultivating
the
hillsides
a
single
steer
hitched
to
the
was
better
adapted
and
the
same
steer
patiently
dragged
a
little
sled
to
the
trading
post
on
steep
declivities
the
sled
is
more
practical
than
a
cart
or
wagon
because
it
can
go
where
wheels
can
not
it
does
not
require
so
wide
a
track
and
it
brakes
automatically
in
going
downhill
nearly
all
the
farmer
hauling
is
downhill
to
his
home
or
down
farther
to
the
village
a
sled
can
be
made
quite
easily
by
one
man
out
of
wood
growing
on
the
spot
and
with
few
iron
fittings
or
none
at
all
the
runners
are
usually
made
of
natural
sourwood
crooks
this
timber
being
chosen
because
it
wears
very
smooth
and
does
not
fur
up
nor
splinter
the
hinterland
is
naturally
adapted
to
grazing
rather
than
to
agriculture
as
it
stands
the
best
pasturage
is
high
up
in
the
mountains
where
there
are
balds
covered
with
succulent
wild
grass
that
resembles
kentucky
bluegrass
clearing
and
sowing
would
extend
such
areas
indefinitely
the
cattle
forage
for
themselves
through
eight
or
nine
months
of
the
year
running
wild
like
the
razorbacks
and
the
only
attention
given
them
is
when
the
herdsmen
go
out
to
salt
them
or
to
mark
the
calves
nearly
all
the
beasts
are
scrub
stock
jerseys
and
other
blooded
cattle
thrive
in
the
valleys
where
there
are
no
free
ranges
but
the
backwoodsman
does
not
want
critters
that
haffter
be
gentled
and
the
result
is
that
many
families
go
without
milk
a
great
part
of
the
year
and
seldom
indeed
taste
butter
or
beef
the
truth
is
that
mountain
beef
being
fed
nothing
but
grass
and
browse
with
barely
enough
corn
and
roughage
to
keep
the
animal
alive
through
winter
is
watery
and
tough
if
properly
reared
the
quality
would
be
as
good
as
any
almost
any
of
our
farmers
could
have
had
a
pasture
near
home
and
could
have
grown
hay
but
not
one
in
ten
would
take
the
trouble
his
cattle
were
only
for
export
let
the
buyer
fatten
them
it
should
be
understood
that
nobody
had
any
provision
for
taking
care
of
fresh
meat
when
the
weather
was
not
frosty
on
those
rare
occasions
when
somebody
killed
a
beef
he
had
to
travel
all
over
the
neighborhood
to
dispose
of
it
in
small
portions
the
carcass
was
cut
up
in
the
same
way
as
a
hog
and
all
parts
except
the
cheap
bilin
pieces
were
sold
at
the
same
price
ten
cents
a
pound
or
whatever
they
would
bring
on
the
spot
the
butchering
was
done
with
an
axe
and
a
jackknife
the
meat
was
either
sliced
thin
and
fried
to
a
crackling
or
cut
in
chunks
and
boiled
furiously
just
long
enough
to
fit
it
for
what
the
butcher
mangled
the
cook
damned
few
sheep
were
raised
in
our
settlement
and
these
only
for
their
wool
the
untamed
smokies
were
no
place
for
such
defenseless
creatures
sheep
will
not
can
not
run
wild
they
are
wholly
dependent
on
the
fostering
hand
of
man
and
perish
without
his
shepherding
curiously
enough
our
mountaineer
knows
little
or
nothing
about
the
goat
an
animal
perfectly
adapted
to
the
free
range
of
the
smokies
i
am
convinced
that
goats
would
be
more
profitable
to
the
small
farmers
of
the
wild
mountains
than
cattle
goats
do
not
graze
but
browse
upon
the
shrubbery
of
which
there
is
a
vast
superfluity
in
all
the
southern
mountains
unlike
the
weak
timorous
and
stupid
sheep
a
flock
of
goats
can
fight
their
own
battles
against
wild
animals
they
are
hardy
in
any
weather
and
thrive
from
their
own
pickings
where
other
foragers
would
starve
a
good
milch
goat
gives
more
and
richer
milk
than
the
average
mountain
cow
and
a
kid
yields
excellent
fresh
meat
in
quantity
at
a
time
when
no
one
would
butcher
a
beef
because
it
would
spoil
i
used
to
shut
my
eyes
and
imagine
the
transformation
that
would
be
wrought
in
these
mountains
by
a
colony
of
swiss
who
would
turn
the
coves
into
gardens
the
moderate
slopes
into
orchards
the
steeper
ones
into
vineyards
by
terracing
and
who
would
export
the
finest
of
cheese
made
from
the
surplus
milk
of
their
goats
but
our
native
mountaineers
well
a
man
who
will
not
eat
beef
nor
drink
fresh
cow
milk
and
who
despises
butter
can
not
be
interested
in
anything
of
the
dairy
order
the
chickens
ran
wild
and
scratched
for
a
living
hence
were
thin
tough
and
poor
layers
eggs
seldom
were
for
sale
it
was
not
of
much
use
to
try
to
raise
many
chickens
where
they
were
unprotected
from
hawks
minks
foxes
weasels
and
snakes
honey
often
was
procured
by
spotting
wild
bees
to
their
hoard
and
chopping
the
tree
a
mild
form
of
sport
in
which
most
settlers
are
expert
our
local
preacher
had
a
hundred
hives
of
tame
bees
producing
pounds
of
honey
a
year
for
which
he
got
ten
cents
a
pound
at
the
railroad
the
mainstay
of
every
farmer
aside
from
his
cornfield
was
his
litter
of
razorback
hogs
old
cornbread
and
sowbelly
are
a
menu
complete
for
the
mountaineer
the
wild
pig
roaming
and
free
over
hill
and
dale
picks
up
his
own
living
at
all
seasons
and
requires
no
attention
at
all
he
is
the
cheapest
possible
source
of
meat
and
yields
the
quickest
return
no
other
food
animal
can
increase
his
own
weight
a
hundred
and
fifty
fold
in
the
first
eight
months
of
his
life
and
so
he
is
regarded
by
his
owner
with
the
same
affection
that
connemara
paddy
bestows
upon
the
gintleman
that
pays
the
rint
in
physique
and
mentality
the
razorback
differs
even
more
from
a
domestic
hog
than
a
wild
goose
does
from
a
tame
one
shaped
in
front
like
a
thin
wedge
he
can
go
through
laurel
thickets
like
a
bear
armored
with
tough
hide
cushioned
by
bristles
he
despises
thorns
brambles
and
rattlesnakes
alike
his
extravagantly
long
snout
can
scent
like
a
cat
and
yet
burrow
uproot
overturn
as
if
made
of
metal
the
long
legs
thin
flanks
pliant
hoofs
fit
him
to
run
like
a
deer
and
climb
like
a
goat
in
courage
and
sagacity
he
outranks
all
other
beasts
a
warrior
born
he
is
also
a
strategist
of
the
first
order
like
man
he
lives
a
communal
life
and
unites
with
others
of
his
kind
for
purposes

the
pig
is
the
only
large
mammal
i
know
of
besides
man
whose
eyes
will
not
shine
by
reflected
light
they
are
too
bold
and
crafty
i
wit
the
razorback
has
a
mind
of
his
own
not
instinct
but
whatever
psychologists
may
say
he
thinks
anybody
can
see
that
when
he
is
not
rooting
or
sleeping
he
is
studying
devilment
he
shows
remarkable
understanding
of
human
speech
especially
profane
speech
and
even
an
uncanny
gift
of
reading
men
thoughts
whenever
those
thoughts
are
directed
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
pigship
he
bears
grudges
broods
over
indignities
and
plans
redresses
for
the
morrow
or
the
week
after
if
he
can
not
get
even
with
you
he
will
lay
for
your
unsuspecting
friend
and
at
the
last
when
arrested
in
his
crimes
and
lodged
in
the
pen
he
is
liable
to
attacks
of
mania
from
sheer
helpless
rage
if
you
camp
out
in
the
mountains
nothing
will
molest
you
but
razorback
hogs
bears
will
flee
and
wildcats
sneak
to
their
dens
but
the
moment
incense
of
cooking
arises
from
your
camp
every
pig
within
two
miles
will
scent
it
and
hasten
to
call
you
may
throw
your
arm
out
of
joint
they
will
laugh
in
your
face
you
may
curse
in
five
languages
it
is
music
to
their
titillating
ears
throughout
summer
and
autumn
i
cooked
out
of
doors
on
the
range
of
forked
stakes
and
a
spanning
parallel
beds
of
rock
when
the
pigs
came
i
fed
them
pie
then
all
said
to
my
hospitality
save
one
tusky
old
boar
and
he
planned
a
campaign
at
the
first
smell
of
smoke
he
would
start
for
my
premises
hiding
securely
in
a
nearby
thicket
he
would
spy
on
the
operations
until
my
stew
got
to
simmering
gently
and
i
would
retire
to
the
cabin
and
get
my
fists
in
the
dough
then
charging
at
speed
he
would
knock
down
a
stake
trip
the
and
send
my
dinner
flying
every
day
he
would
do
this
it
got
so
that
i
had
to
sit
there
facing
the
fire
all
through
my
cooking
or
that
beast
of
a
hog
would
ruin
me
with
this
i
thought
he
was
outgeneraled
idle
dream
he
would
slip
off
to
my
favorite
neighbor
break
through
the
garden
fence
and
raise
ned
instanter
all
because
he
hated
for
that
peppery
fraud
and
knew
that
bob
and
i
were
cronies
i
dubbed
this
pig
belial
a
name
that
bob
promptly
adapted
to
his
own
notion
by
calling
it
that
swore
he
would
cross
hell
on
a
rotten
rail
to
git
into
my
patch
finally
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
took
down
my
rifle
it
was
a
and
i
through
constant
practice
in
beheading
squirrels
was
in
good
form
however
in
the
mountains
it
is
more
heinous
to
kill
another
man
pig
than
to
shoot
the
owner
so
i
took
craft
for
my
guide
and
guile
for
my
heart
counsel
i
stalked
belial
as
stealthily
as
ever
hunter
crept
on
an
antelope
against
the
wind
at
last
i
had
him
dead
right
broadside
to
me
and
motionless
as
if
in
a
daydream
i
knew
that
if
i
drilled
his
ear
or
shot
his
tail
clean
off
it
would
only
make
him
meaner
than
ever
he
sported
an
uncommonly
fine
tail
and
was
proud
to
flaunt
it
i
drew
down
on
that
member
purposely
a
trifle
scant
fired
and
away
scuttled
that
boar
with
a
tail
that
would
dangle
and
cling
to
him
disgracefully
through
life
illustration
bob
exit
belial
it
was
equivalent
to
a
broken
heart
he
emigrated
or
committed
suicide
i
know
not
which
but
the
smoky
mountains
knew
him
no
more
chapter
iii
the
great
smoky
mountains
for
a
long
time
my
chief
interest
was
not
in
human
neighbors
but
in
the
mountains
themselves
in
that
mysterious
beckoning
hinterland
which
rose
right
back
of
my
chimney
and
spread
upward
outward
almost
to
three
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
mile
after
mile
hour
after
hour
of
lusty
climbing
an
eden
still
unpeopled
and
unspoiled
i
loved
of
a
morning
to
slip
on
my
haversack
pick
up
my
rifle
or
maybe
a
mere
staff
and
stride
forth
alone
over
haphazard
routes
to
enjoy
in
my
own
untutored
way
the
infinite
variety
of
form
and
color
and
shade
of
plant
and
tree
and
animal
life
in
that
superb
wilderness
that
towered
there
far
above
all
homes
of
men
and
i
love
it
still
albeit
the
charm
of
new
discovery
is
gone
from
those
heights
and
gulfs
that
are
now
so
intimate
and
full
of
memories
the
carolina
mountains
have
a
character
all
their
own
rising
abruptly
from
a
low
base
and
then
rounding
more
gradually
upward
for
to
feet
above
their
valleys
their
apparent
height
is
more
impressive
than
that
of
many
a
loftier
summit
in
the
west
which
forms
only
a
protuberance
on
an
elevated
plateau
nearly
all
of
them
are
clad
to
their
tops
in
dense
forest
and
thick
undergrowth
here
and
there
is
a
grassy
bald
a
natural
meadow
curiously
perched
on
the
very
top
of
a
mountain
there
are
no
bare
rocky
summits
rising
above
few
jutting
crags
no
ribs
and
vertebræ
of
the
earth
exposed
seldom
does
one
see
even
a
naked
ledge
of
rock
the
very
cliffs
are
sheathed
with
trees
and
shrubs
so
that
one
treading
their
edges
has
no
fear
of
falling
into
an
abyss
pinnacles
or
serrated
ridges
are
rare
there
are
few
commanding
peaks
from
almost
any
summit
in
carolina
one
looks
out
upon
a
sea
of
flowing
curves
and
eminences
undulating
with
no
great
disparity
of
height
unto
the
horizon
almost
everywhere
the
contours
are
similar
steep
sides
gradually
rounding
to
the
tops
to
the
eye
because
of
the
endless
verdure
every
ridge
is
separated
from
its
sisters
by
deep
and
narrow
ravines
not
one
of
the
thousand
water
courses
shows
a
glint
of
its
dashing
stream
save
where
some
river
may
reveal
through
a
gap
in
the
mountain
one
single
shimmering
curve
in
all
this
vast
prospect
a
keen
eye
knowing
where
to
look
may
detect
an
occasional
farmer
clearing
but
to
the
stranger
there
is
only
mountain
and
forest
mountain
and
forest
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
characteristic
too
is
the
dreamy
blue
haze
like
that
of
indian
summer
intensified
that
ever
hovers
over
the
mountains
unless
they
be
swathed
in
cloud
or
for
a
few
minutes
after
a
sharp
has
cleared
the
atmosphere
both
the
blue
ridge
and
the
smoky
mountains
owe
their
names
to
this
tenuous
mist
it
softens
all
outlines
and
lends
a
effect
of
great
distance
to
objects
that
are
but
a
few
miles
off
while
those
farther
removed
grow
more
and
more
intangible
until
finally
the
blends
with
the
sky
itself
the
foreground
of
such
a
landscape
in
summer
is
warm
soft
dreamy
caressing
habitable
beyond
it
are
gentle
and
luring
solitudes
the
remote
ranges
are
inexpressibly
lonesome
isolated
and
mysterious
but
everywhere
the
green
forest
mantle
bespeaks
a
vital
present
nowhere
does
cold
bare
granite
stand
as
the
sepulchre
of
an
immemorial
past
and
yet
these
very
mountains
of
carolina
are
among
the
ancients
of
the
earth
they
were
old
very
old
before
the
alps
and
the
andes
the
rockies
and
the
himalayas
were
molded
into
their
primal
shapes
upon
them
in
after
ages
were
born
the
first
hardwoods
of
america
perhaps
those
of
europe
too
and
upon
them
the
last
great
hardwood
forests
of
our
country
stand
in
primeval
majesty
mutely
awaiting
their
imminent
doom
the
richness
of
the
great
smoky
forest
has
been
the
wonder
and
the
admiration
of
everyone
who
has
traversed
it
as
one
climbs
from
the
river
to
one
of
the
main
peaks
he
passes
successively
through
the
same
floral
zones
he
would
encounter
in
traveling
from
to
southern
canada
starting
amid
sycamores
elms
gums
willows
persimmons
chinquapins
he
soon
enters
a
region
of
beech
birch
basswood
magnolia
cucumber
butternut
holly
sourwood
box
elder
ash
maple
buckeye
poplar
hemlock
and
a
great
number
of
other
growths
along
the
creeks
and
branches
on
the
lower
slopes
are
many
species
of
oaks
with
hickory
hemlock
pitch
pine
locust
dogwood
chestnut
in
this
region
nearly
all
trees
attain
their
fullest
development
on
north
fronts
of
hills
the
oaks
reach
a
diameter
of
five
to
six
feet
in
cool
rich
coves
chestnut
trees
grow
from
six
to
nine
feet
across
the
stump
and
tulip
poplars
up
to
ten
or
eleven
feet
their
straight
trunks
towering
like
gigantic
columns
with
scarcely
a
noticeable
taper
seventy
or
eighty
feet
to
the
nearest
limb
ascending
above
the
zone
of
feet
white
oak
is
replaced
by
the
no
less
valuable
mountain
oak
beech
birch
buckeye
and
chestnut
persist
to
feet
then
where
the
beeches
dwindle
until
adult
trees
are
only
there
begins
a
zone
of
black
spruce
balsam
striped
maple
aspen
and
the
peruvian
or
red
cherry
i
have
named
only
a
few
of
the
prevailing
growths
nowhere
else
in
the
temperate
zone
is
there
such
a
variety
of
merchantable
timber
as
in
western
carolina
and
the
tennessee
front
of
the
unaka
system
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
species
of
native
trees
grow
in
the
smoky
forest
itself
when
asa
gray
visited
the
north
carolina
mountains
he
identified
in
a
trip
a
greater
variety
of
indigenous
trees
than
could
be
observed
in
crossing
europe
from
england
to
turkey
or
in
a
trip
from
boston
to
the
rocky
mountain
plateau
as
john
muir
has
said
our
forests
however
slighted
by
man
must
have
been
a
great
delight
to
god
for
they
were
the
best
he
ever
planted
the
undergrowth
is
of
almost
tropical
luxuriance
and
variety
botanists
say
that
this
is
the
richest
collecting
ground
in
the
united
states
whether
one
be
seeking
ferns
or
fungi
or
orchids
or
almost
anything
else
vegetal
each
hour
will
bring
him
some
new
delight
in
summer
the
upper
mountains
are
one
vast
flower
garden
the
white
and
pink
of
rhododendron
the
blaze
of
azalea
conspicuous
above
all
else
in
settings
of
every
imaginable
shade
of
green
it
was
the
botanist
who
discovered
this
eden
for
us
far
back
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
this
was
still
cherokee
country
inhabited
by
no
whites
but
a
few
william
bartram
of
philadelphia
came
into
the
mountains
of
western
carolina
and
spread
their
fame
to
the
world
one
of
his
choicest
finds
was
the
fiery
azalea
of
which
he
recorded
the
epithet
fiery
i
annex
to
this
most
celebrated
species
of
azalea
as
being
expressive
of
the
appearance
of
its
flowers
which
are
in
general
of
the
color
of
the
finest
orange
and
bright
gold
as
well
as
yellow
and
these
various
splendid
colors
are
not
only
in
separate
plants
but
frequently
all
the
varieties
and
shades
are
seen
in
separate
branches
on
the
same
plant
and
the
clusters
of
the
blossoms
cover
the
shrubs
in
such
incredible
profusion
on
the
hillsides
that
suddenly
opening
to
view
from
dark
shades
we
are
alarmed
with
apprehension
of
the
woods
being
set
on
fire
this
is
certainly
the
most
gay
and
brilliant
flowering
shrub
yet
known
and
we
of
a
later
age
seeing
the
same
wild
gardens
still
unspoiled
can
appreciate
the
almost
religious
fervor
of
those
early
botanists
as
of
michaux
for
example
who
in
ascending
the
peak
of
grandfather
broke
out
in
song
au
sommet
de
la
plus
haut
montagne
de
tout
septentrionale
chante
avec
mon
de
marsellois
et
crié
la
liberté
et
la
république
française
of
course
michaux
was
wildly
mistaken
in
thinking
grandfather
the
highest
mountain
in
all
north
america
it
is
far
from
being
even
the
highest
of
the
appalachians
yet
we
scarcely
know
to
a
downright
certainty
which
peak
is
supreme
among
our
southern
highlands
the
honor
is
conceded
to
mount
mitchell
in
the
black
mountains
northeast
of
asheville
still
the
heights
of
the
carolina
peaks
have
been
taken
with
but
one
exception
so
far
as
i
know
only
by
barometric
measurements
and
these
even
when
official
may
vary
as
much
as
a
hundred
feet
for
the
same
mountain
since
the
highest
ten
or
a
dozen
of
our
carolina
peaks
differ
in
altitude
only
one
or
two
hundred
feet
their
actual
rank
has
not
yet
been
determined
illustration
photo
by
forest
service
there
are
few
jutting
crags
southeast
profile
of
whiteside
mountain
for
a
long
time
there
was
controversy
as
to
whether
mount
mitchell
or
clingman
dome
was
the
crowning
summit
of
eastern
america
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey
gave
the
height
of
mount
mitchell
as
feet
but
later
figures
of
the
geological
survey
are
and
in
buckley
claimed
for
clingman
dome
of
the
smokies
an
altitude
of
feet
in
recent
government
reports
the
dome
appears
variously
as
and
in
i
was
told
by
ramseur
that
when
he
laid
out
the
route
of
the
railroad
from
asheville
to
murphy
he
ran
a
line
of
levels
from
a
known
datum
on
this
road
to
the
top
of
clingman
and
that
the
result
was
four
sixes
feet
above
it
is
probable
that
second
place
among
the
peaks
of
appalachia
may
belong
either
to
clingman
dome
or
guyot
or
leconte
of
the
smokies
or
to
balsam
cone
of
the
black
mountains
in
any
case
the
great
smoky
mountains
are
the
master
chain
of
the
appalachian
system
the
greatest
mass
of
highland
east
of
the
rockies
this
segment
of
the
unakas
forms
the
boundary
between
north
carolina
and
tennessee
from
the
big
pigeon
river
to
the
mcdaniel
bald
although
some
parts
of
the
smokies
are
very
rugged
with
sharp
changes
of
elevation
yet
the
range
as
a
whole
has
no
one
dominating
peak
mount
guyot
pronounced
with
as
in
get
mount
leconte
and
clingman
dome
all
are
over
feet
and
under
according
to
the
most
trustworthy
measurements
many
miles
of
the
divide
rise
feet
above
with
only
small
undulations
like
ocean
swells
the
most
rugged
and
difficult
part
of
the
smokies
and
of
the
united
states
east
of
colorado
is
in
the
sawtooth
mountains
between
collins
and
guyot
at
the
headwaters
of
the
okona
lufty
river
i
know
but
few
men
who
have
ever
followed
this
part
of
the
divide
although
during
the
present
year
trails
have
been
cut
from
clingman
to
collins
or
near
it
and
possibly
others
beyond
to
the
northeastward
in
august
and
september
james
ferriss
and
wife
naturalists
from
joliet
illinois
explored
the
smokies
to
the
lufty
gap
northeast
of
clingman
collecting
rare
species
of
snails
and
ferns
no
doubt
ferriss
is
the
only
white
woman
who
ever
went
beyond
clingman
or
even
ascended
the
dome
itself
she
stayed
at
the
lufty
gap
while
her
husband
and
a
carolina
mountaineer
of
my
acquaintance
struggled
through
to
guyot
and
returned
of
this
trip
ferriss
sent
me
the
following
account
we
bought
another
axe
of
a
moonshiner
and
with
a
week
provisions
on
our
backs
one
of
the
guides
and
i
took
the
consolidated
american
black
bear
and
ruffed
grouse
line
for
mount
guyot
twenty
miles
farther
by
map
measurement
the
bears
were
in
full
possession
of
the
property
and
we
could
get
no
information
in
the
settlements
as
the
settlers
do
not
travel
this
line
they
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
peaks
other
than
as
tops
of
the
great
smokies
knew
nothing
of
the
character
of
the
country
except
that
it
was
rough
the
tennesseeans
seem
afraid
of
the
mountains
and
the
cherokees
of
the
north
carolina
side
equally
so
for
two
miles
from
camp
all
traces
of
man
except
surveyors
marks
had
disappeared
in
the
first
two
days
we
routed
eight
bears
out
of
their
nests
and
mud
wallows
and
they
seemed
to
stay
routed
for
upon
our
return
we
found
the
blackberry
crop
unharvested
and
had
a
bag
pudding
or
what
you
call
it
a
surveyor
had
run
part
of
the
line
this
year
which
helped
us
greatly
and
the
bears
had
made
trails
part
of
the
way
in
places
they
had
mussed
up
the
ground
as
much
as
a
barnyard
we
tried
to
follow
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
which
is
exactly
upon
the
top
of
the
smokies
but
often
missed
it
the
government
state
surveyor
many
years
ago
made
two
hacks
upon
the
trees
but
sometimes
the
linemen
neglected
to
use
their
axes
for
half
a
mile
or
so
it
took
us
three
and
days
to
go
and
two
and
to
return
and
we
arose
with
the
morning
star
and
worked
hard
all
day
the
last
day
and
a
half
going
there
was
nothing
to
guide
us
but
the
old
hacks
equipped
with
government
maps
a
good
compass
and
a
little
conceit
i
thought
i
could
follow
the
in
fact
at
one
time
we
intended
to
go
through
without
a
guide
a
trail
that
runs
through
blackberry
bushes
two
miles
out
of
three
is
hard
to
follow
then
there
was
a
huckleberry
bush
reaching
to
our
waists
growing
thickly
upon
the
ground
as
tomato
vines
curled
hard
and
stubborn
and
laurel
much
like
a
field
of
lilac
bushes
crooked
and
strong
as
iron
in
one
place
we
walked
fully
a
quarter
of
a
mile
over
the
tops
of
laurel
bushes
and
these
were
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
height
but
blown
over
one
way
by
the
wind
much
of
the
trail
was
along
rocky
edges
sometimes
but
six
inches
or
so
wide
but
almost
straight
down
on
both
sides
for
hundreds
of
feet
one
night
delayed
by
lack
of
water
we
did
not
camp
till
dark
and
finding
a
smooth
spot
lay
down
with
a
small
log
on
each
side
to
hold
us
from
rolling
out
of
bed
when
daylight
came
we
found
that
had
we
rolled
over
the
logs
my
partner
would
have
dropped
feet
into
tennessee
and
i
would
have
dropped
as
far
into
north
carolina
unless
some
friendly
tree
top
had
caught
us
sometimes
the
mountain
forked
and
these
ridges
concealed
by
the
balsams
would
not
be
seen
then
there
were
round
knobs
and
who
can
tell
where
the
highest
ridge
lies
on
a
round
mountain
or
a
ball
my
woolen
shirt
was
torn
off
to
the
shoulders
and
my
partner
who
had
started
out
with
corduroys
stayed
in
the
brush
until
i
got
him
a
pair
of
overalls
from
camp
even
to
the
west
of
clingman
a
stranger
is
likely
to
find
some
desperately
rough
travel
if
he
should
stray
from
the
trail
that
follows
the
divide
it
is
easy
going
for
anyone
in
fair
weather
but
when
cloud
settles
on
the
mountain
as
it
often
does
without
warning
it
may
be
so
thick
that
one
can
not
see
a
tree
ten
feet
away
under
such
circumstances
i
have
myself
floundered
from
daylight
till
dark
through
laurel
thickets
and
without
a
bite
to
eat
not
knowing
whither
i
was
going
except
that
it
was
toward
the
little
tennessee
river
in
i
spent
the
summer
in
a
herders
hut
on
top
of
the
divide
just
west
of
the
locust
ridge
miscalled
chestnut
ridge
on
the
map
about
six
miles
east
of
thunderhead
this
time
i
had
a
partner
and
we
had
a
glorious
three
months
of
it
nearly
a
mile
above
and
only
half
a
day
climb
from
the
nearest
settlement
one
day
i
was
alone
andy
having
gone
down
to
medlin
for
the
mail
it
had
rained
a
good
deal
in
fact
there
was
a
shower
nearly
every
day
throughout
the
summer
the
only
semblance
of
a
dry
season
in
the
smokies
being
the
autumn
and
early
winter
the
nights
were
cold
enough
for
fires
and
blankets
even
in
our
cabin
well
i
had
finished
my
lonesome
dinner
and
was
washing
up
when
i
saw
a
man
approaching
this
was
an
event
for
we
seldom
saw
other
men
than
our
two
selves
he
was
a
lame
man
wearing
an
iron
extension
on
one
foot
and
he
hobbled
with
a
cane
he
looked
and
gaunt
i
met
him
outside
he
smiled
as
though
i
looked
good
to
him
and
asked
with
some
eagerness
can
i
buy
something
to
eat
here
no
i
answered
you
ca
buy
anything
here
how
his
face
fell
but
i
give
you
the
best
we
have
and
you
welcome
then
you
should
have
seen
that
smile
he
seemed
to
have
just
enough
strength
left
to
drag
himself
into
the
hut
i
asked
no
questions
though
wondering
what
a
cripple
evidently
a
gentleman
though
in
rather
bad
repair
was
doing
on
top
of
the
smoky
mountains
it
was
plain
that
he
had
spent
more
than
one
night
shelterless
in
the
cold
rain
and
that
he
was
quite
famished
while
i
was
baking
the
biscuit
and
cooking
some
meat
he
told
his
story
this
is
the
short
of
it
i
am
a
canadian
mcgill
university
man
electrician
my
company
sent
me
to
cincinnati
i
got
a
vacation
of
a
couple
of
weeks
and
thought
take
a
pedestrian
tour
i
can
walk
better
than
you
think
and
he
tapped
the
short
leg
i
liked
his
grit
i
knew
no
place
to
go
he
continued
so
i
took
a
map
and
looked
for
what
might
be
interesting
country
not
too
far
from
cincinnati
i
picked
out
these
mountains
got
a
couple
of
government
topographical
sheets
and
thinking
they
would
serve
like
european
ordnance
maps
i
had
no
fear
of
going
astray
it
was
my
plan
to
walk
through
to
the
balsam
mountains
and
so
on
to
the
big
pigeon
river
i
went
to
maryville
tennessee
and
there
i
was
told
that
i
would
find
a
cabin
every
five
or
six
miles
along
the
summit
from
thunderhead
to
the
balsams
i
broke
in
abruptly
whoever
told
you
that
was
either
an
impostor
or
an
ignoramus
there
are
only
four
of
these
shacks
on
the
whole
smoky
range
two
of
them
the
russell
cabin
and
the
spencer
place
you
have
already
passed
without
knowing
it
this
is
called
the
hall
cabin
none
of
these
three
are
occupied
save
for
a
week
or
so
in
the
fall
when
the
cattle
are
being
rounded
up
or
by
chance
as
my
partner
and
i
happen
to
be
here
now
beyond
this
there
is
just
one
shack
at
siler
meadow
it
is
down
below
the
summit
hidden
in
timber
and
you
would
never
have
seen
it
even
if
you
had
you
would
have
found
it
as
bare
as
a
last
year
mouse
nest
for
nobody
ever
goes
there
except
a
few
from
there
onward
for
forty
miles
is
an
uninhabited
wilderness
so
rough
that
you
could
not
make
seven
miles
a
day
in
it
to
save
your
life
even
if
you
knew
the
course
and
there
is
no
trail
at
all
those
government
maps
are
good
and
reliable
to
show
the
to
this
wild
country
but
where
you
need
them
most
they
are
good
for
nothing
illustration
the
bears
home
laurel
and
rhododendron
then
said
he
if
i
had
missed
your
cabin
i
would
have
starved
to
death
for
i
depended
on
finding
a
house
to
the
eastward
and
would
have
followed
the
trail
till
i
dropped
i
have
been
out
in
the
laurel
thickets
now
three
days
and
two
nights
so
nothing
could
have
induced
me
to
leave
this
trail
once
i
found
it
or
until
i
could
see
out
to
a
house
on
one
side
or
other
of
the
mountain
you
would
see
no
house
on
either
side
from
here
to
beyond
guyot
about
forty
miles
had
you
no
rations
at
all
i
traveled
light
expecting
to
find
entertainment
among
the
natives
here
is
what
i
have
left
he
showed
me
a
crumpled
buckwheat
flapjack
a
pinch
of
tea
and
a
couple
of
ounces
of
brandy
i
was
saving
them
for
the
last
extremity
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
morning
drink
the
brandy
please
it
came
from
montreal
no
my
boy
that
liquor
goes
down
your
own
throat
instanter
you
the
chap
that
needs
it
this
coffee
will
boil
now
in
a
minute
i
wo
give
you
all
the
food
you
want
for
it
would
be
prudent
but
by
and
by
you
shall
have
a
bellyful
then
as
well
as
he
could
he
sketched
the
route
he
had
followed
where
the
trail
from
tennessee
crosses
from
thunderhead
to
haw
gap
he
had
swerved
off
from
the
divide
and
he
discovered
his
error
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
blockhouse
there
instead
of
retracing
his
steps
he
sought
a
by
plunging
down
to
the
headwaters
of
haw
creek
thus
worming
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
devil
nest
one
more
day
would
have
finished
him
when
i
told
him
that
the
trip
from
clingman
to
guyot
would
be
hard
work
for
a
party
of
experienced
mountaineers
and
that
it
would
probably
take
them
a
week
during
which
time
they
would
have
to
pack
all
supplies
on
their
own
backs
he
agreed
that
his
best
course
would
be
down
into
carolina
and
out
to
the
railroad
of
animal
life
in
the
mountains
i
was
most
entertained
by
the
raven
this
extraordinary
bird
was
the
first
creature
noah
liberated
from
the
ark
he
must
have
known
even
at
that
early
period
of
nature
study
that
it
was
the
most
sagacious
of
all
winged
things
or
perhaps
noah
and
the
raven
did
not
get
on
well
together
and
he
rid
himself
of
the
pest
at
first
opportunity
doubtless
there
could
have
been
no
peace
aboard
a
craft
that
harbored
so
inquisitive
and
talkative
a
fowl
anyway
the
wild
raven
has
been
superlatively
shy
of
man
ever
since
the
flood
probably
there
is
no
place
south
of
labrador
where
our
raven
corax
is
seen
so
often
as
in
the
smokies
and
yet
even
here
a
man
may
haunt
the
tops
for
weeks
without
sight
or
sound
of
the
ebon
mystery
then
for
a
few
days
they
will
be
common
on
the
southeast
side
of
the
locust
ridge
opposite
huggins
hell
between
bone
valley
and
the
main
fork
of
hazel
creek
there
is
a
raven
cliff
where
they
winter
and
breed
using
the
same
nests
year
after
year
occasionally
one
is
trapped
with
bloody
groundhog
for
bait
but
i
have
yet
to
meet
a
man
who
has
succeeded
in
shooting
one
if
the
raven
body
be
elusive
his
tongue
assuredly
is
not
no
other
animal
save
man
has
anything
like
his
vocal
range
the
raven
croaks
clucks
caws
chuckles
squalls
pleads
grunts
barks
mimics
small
birds
hectors
cajoles
yes
pulls
a
cork
whets
a
scythe
files
a
saw
with
his
throat
as
is
well
known
ravens
can
be
taught
human
speech
like
parrots
and
i
am
told
they
show
the
same
preference
for
bad
words
which
i
think
is
quite
in
character
with
their
reputation
as
thieves
and
butchers
however
i
may
be
prejudiced
seeing
that
the
raven
favorite
dainties
for
his
menu
are
the
eyes
of
living
fawns
and
lambs
a
stranger
in
these
mountains
will
be
surprised
at
the
apparent
scarcity
of
game
animals
it
is
not
unusual
for
one
to
hunt
all
day
in
an
absolute
wilderness
where
he
sees
never
a
fresh
track
of
man
and
not
get
a
shot
at
anything
fit
to
eat
the
cover
is
so
dense
that
one
going
without
dogs
has
poor
chance
of
spying
the
game
that
lurks
about
him
and
there
really
is
little
of
it
by
comparison
with
such
huntings
fields
as
the
adirondacks
maine
canada
where
game
has
been
conserved
for
many
years
it
used
to
be
the
same
up
there
the
late
stillman
writing
in
of
the
maine
woods
said
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
forest
after
one
has
become
habituated
to
the
gloom
the
pathlessness
and
the
apparent
impenetrability
of
the
screen
it
forms
around
him
is
the
absence
of
animal
life
you
may
wander
for
hours
without
seeing
a
living
creature
one
thinks
of
the
woods
and
the
wild
beasts
yet
in
all
the
years
of
my
wilderness
living
i
can
catalogue
the
wild
creatures
other
than
squirrels
grouse
and
small
birds
never
plenty
generally
very
rare
which
i
have
accidentally
encountered
and
seen
while
wandering
for
hunting
or
mere
pastime
in
the
wild
forest
one
deer
one
porcupine
one
marten
commonly
called
sable
and
maybe
half
a
dozen
hares
you
may
walk
hours
and
not
see
a
living
creature
larger
than
a
fly
for
days
together
and
not
see
a
grouse
a
squirrel
or
a
bird
larger
than
the
canada
jay
lands
running
with
game
are
like
those
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
when
the
sporting
books
tell
you
that
game
is
abundant
imagine
that
you
are
assured
from
starvation
thereby
i
have
been
reduced
in
a
country
where
deer
were
swarming
to
live
several
days
together
on
corn
meal
it
is
much
the
same
in
our
appalachian
wilderness
where
no
protection
worthy
the
name
has
ever
been
afforded
the
game
and
fish
since
indian
times
there
is
a
class
of
very
common
here
that
ranges
the
forest
at
all
seasons
with
shotguns
or
hog
rifles
killing
bearing
females
as
well
as
legitimate
game
fishing
at
night
even
using
dynamite
in
the
streams
and
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
better
game
harborage
granted
by
nature
on
our
continent
than
the
carolina
mountains
the
deer
are
all
but
exterminated
in
most
districts
turkeys
and
even
squirrels
are
rather
scarce
and
good
trout
fishing
is
limited
to
stocked
waters
or
streams
flowing
through
virgin
forest
the
only
game
animal
that
still
holds
his
own
is
the
black
bear
and
he
endures
in
few
places
other
than
the
roughest
districts
such
as
that
southwest
of
the
sugarland
mountains
where
laurel
and
cliffs
daunt
all
but
the
hardiest
of
men
the
only
venomous
snakes
in
the
mountains
are
rattlers
and
copperheads
the
former
common
the
latter
rare
the
chance
of
being
bitten
by
one
is
about
as
remote
as
that
of
being
struck
by
lightning
either
accident
happen
of
course
the
mountaineers
have
an
absurd
notion
that
the
little
lizard
so
common
in
the
hills
is
rank
pizen
oddly
enough
they
call
it
a
scorpion
from
those
two
pests
of
the
north
woods
and
mosquitoes
the
smokies
are
mercifully
exempt
at
least
there
are
no
mosquitoes
that
bite
or
sting
except
down
in
the
river
valleys
where
they
have
been
introduced
by
railroad
trains
and
even
there
they
are
but
a
feeble
folk
the
reason
is
that
in
the
mountains
there
is
almost
no
standing
water
where
they
can
breed
on
the
other
hand
the
common
is
extraordinarily
numerous
and
persistent
a
daily
curse
even
on
top
of
smoky
i
imagine
this
is
due
to
the
wet
climate
as
in
ireland
minute
gnats
the
punkies
or
of
the
north
are
also
offensively
present
in
time
and
every
cabin
is
alive
with
fleas
a
hundred
nights
i
have
anointed
myself
with
citronella
from
head
to
foot
and
outsmelt
a
cheap
to
escape
their
plague
in
a
tent
and
without
dogs
one
can
be
immune
in
most
years
there
are
very
few
chiggers
except
on
pine
ridges
they
are
worse
along
rivers
than
in
the
mountains
the
ticks
of
this
country
are
not
numerous
and
seldom
fasten
on
man
the
climate
of
the
carolina
mountains
is
pleasantly
cool
in
summer
even
at
low
altitudes
to
feet
the
nights
generally
are
refreshing
it
may
be
hot
in
the
sun
but
always
cool
in
the
shade
the
air
is
drier
less
relative
humidity
than
in
the
lowlands
notwithstanding
that
there
is
greater
rainfall
here
than
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
outside
of
florida
and
the
puget
sound
country
the
annual
rainfall
varies
a
great
deal
according
to
locality
being
least
at
asheville
inches
and
greatest
on
the
southeastern
slope
of
the
blue
ridge
where
as
much
as
inches
has
been
recorded
in
a
year
the
average
rainfall
of
the
whole
region
is
inches
a
year
in
general
the
mornings
are
apt
to
be
lowery
with
fogs
hanging
low
until
say
so
that
one
can
not
predict
weather
for
the
day
heavy
dews
remain
on
the
bushes
until
about
the
same
hour
the
winters
are
short
what
northerners
would
call
cold
weather

snow
sometimes
falls
on

exceptionally
it

tornadoes
are

sometimes
a
hurricane
will
sweep

on

a
blizzard
from
the
northwest
struck
the
smokies
in
twenty
minutes
everything
was
frozen
at
siler
meadow
seventeen
cattle
climbed
upon
each
other
for
warmth
and
froze
to
death

hecatomb
a
herdsman
who
was
out
at
the
time

escaped

may

in

drops

the

cold
often
is
intense
and
on

the

mine
undoubtedly
there
is

hidden
in

carolina
mountains
a
greater
variety
of
minerals
has
been
found
here
than
in
any
other
state
save
colorado
but
for
the
present
it
is
a
hard
country
to
prospect
in
owing
to
the
thick
covering
of
the
forest
floor
not
only
is
the
underbrush
very
dense
but
beneath
it
there
generally
is
a
thick
stratum

clay
overlaying
the
rocks

on
steep
slopes
gold
has
been

in
numberless
places
but
finely
disseminated
i
do
not
know
a
locality
in
the
mountains
proper
where
a
working
vein
has
been
discovered
at
my
cabin
i
did
just
enough
panning
to
get
a
notion
that
if
i
could
stand
working
in
icy
water
ten
hours
a
day
i
might
average
a
dollar
in
yellow
dust

the

copper
mine

gold
silver
and
lead
are
not
common
so
far
as
known
but
there
are
many
good
copper
and
iron
properties
gems
are
mined
profitably
in
several
of
the
western
counties
the
corundum
mica
talc
and
monazite
are
i
believe
unexcelled
in
the
united
states
building
stone
is
abundant
and
there
is
fine
marble
in

kaolin
is
shipped
out
in

quantities
the
rocks
chiefly
are
gneisses
granites
metamorphosed
marbles
quartzites
and
slates
all
of
them
far
too
old
to
bear

some

from

a

hunchback
reached
his
long

to
a

that
hung
under

drew
out
a
chuck
of
salt
pork
and
began
slicing

with

i
learned
that

out
upon

of

for

of

covered
its

we
called

there
had
risen
a

made

abominably
that

gathered
about

served

sat

was

a

could

in

i
had
lain
flat
on

clinging

the

turned

you

big
storm
three
year
ago
come

when
the
cattle
all
huddled
up
o
each
other
and
friz
in
one
pile
solid
bill
grunted
an
affirmative
wal
sir
i
was
over
at
the
spencer
place
and
was
out
on
thunderhead
when
the
wind
sprung
up
thar
come
one
turrible
blow
that
jest
nacherally
lifted
the
ground
i
went
up
in
the
sky
my
coat
ripped
off
and
i
went
yes
yes
about
half
an
hour
later
i
lit
in
the
mud
way
down
yander
in
tuckaleechee
cove
yes
sir
ten
mile
as
the
crow
flies
and
a
mile
deeper
swim
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
little
john
spoke
up
i
mind
about
that
time
doc
but
i
disremember
which
planted
ye
in
planted
huh
but
i
had
one
tormentin
time
findin
my
hat
the
cabin
shook
under
a
heavier
blast
to
match
bill
yarn
old
blowin
liars
out
o
north
hang
on
to
yer

doc
whoop
hear
durn
this
blow
anyhow
no
bear
cross
the
mountain
sich
a
night
as
this
ca
we
hunt
down
on
the
carolina
side
i
asked
that
whar
we
goin
to
drive
but
hit
no
use
if
the
bear
come
over
how
is
that
do
they
sleep
in
one
state
and
eat
in
the
other
yes
you
see
the
tennessee
side
of
the
mountain
is
powerful
steep
and
laurely
so
man
nor
dog
cai
git
over
it
in
lots
o
places
whar
the
bears
den
but
the
mast
sich
as
acorns
and
beech
and
hickory
nuts
is
mostly
on
the
side
that
whar
they
hafter
come
to
feed
so
when
it
blows
like
this
they
stay
at
home
and
suck
their
paws
till
the
weather
clars
so
we
have
to
do
at
this
rate
i
go
see
whut
the
looks
like
we
arose
from
our
squatting
postures
john
opened
the
little
clapboard
door
which
swung
violently
backward
as
another
gust
boomed
against
the
cabin
dust
and
hot
ashes
scattered
in
every
direction
the
dogs
sprang
up
one
encroached
upon
another
and
they
flew
at
each
other
throats
they
were
powerful
beasts
dangerous
to
man
as
well
as
to
the
brutes
they
were
trained
to
fight
but
john
was
their
master
and
he
soon
booted
them
into
surly
subjection
the
older
dog
do
ginerally
raise
no
ruction
hit
the
younger
one
that
ill
by
which
he
meant
vicious
you
coaly
you
git
some
that
meanness
shuck
outen
you
if
you
tackle
an
old
has
the
young
dog
ever
fought
a
bear
no
he
do
know
nothin
but
i
reckon
he
pick
up
some
larnin
in
the
next
two
three
days
have
these
dogs
got
the
plott
strain
i
been
told
that
the
plott
hounds
are
the
best
bear
dogs
in
the
country
so
snorted
john
the
plott
curs
are
the
best
that
is
half
hound
half
cur
though
what
calls
the
cur
in
this
case
raelly
comes
from
a
big
furrin
dog
that
i
do
rightly
know
the
breed
of
fellers
you
can
talk
as
you
please
about
a
streak
o
the
cur
spilin
a
dog
but
i
know
hit
ai
so
not
for
bear
fightin
in
these
mountains
whar
you
cai
foller
up
on
hossback
but
hafter
do
your
own
runnin
what
is
the
reason
john
illustration
what
soldiers
these
fellows
would
make
under
leadership
of
some
backwoods
napoleon
waal
hit
like
this
a
plumb
cur
of
course
cai
foller
a
cold
track
he
just
runs
by
sight
and
he
wo
hang
he
quits
but
way
no
hound
raelly
fight
a
bear
hit
takes
a
big
severe
dog
to
do
that
hounds
has
the
best
noses
and
they
run
a
bear
all
day
and
night
and
the
next
day
too
but
they
wo
never
tree
afeared
to
close
in
now
look
at
them
dogs
o
mine
a
cur
ai
got
no
them
dogs
has
my
dogs
can
foller
ary
trail
same
a
hound
but
they
run
right
in
on
the
varmint
snappin
and
chawin
and
worryin
him
till
he
gits
so
mad
you
can
hear
his
tushes
pop
half
a
mile
he
cai
run
away
he
haster
stop
every
bit
and
fight
finally
he
gits
so
tired
and
het
up
that
he
trees
to
rest
hisself
then
ketches
up
and
finishes
him
mebbe
do
know
that
a
dog
is
but
somebody
thinking
that
had
gone
far
enough
produced
a
bottle
of
that
was
too
new
to
have
paid
tax
then
we
discovered
that
there
was
musical
talent
of
a
sort
in
little
john
he
cut
a
twirled
around
with
an
imaginary
banjo
and
sang
in
a
quaint
minor
did
you
see
the
devil
with
his
and
ladle
and
his
iron
shovel
and
his
old
gourd
head
o
i
go
to
meetin
and
i
go
to
meetin
yes
i
go
to
meetin
in
an
old
tin
pan
other
songs
followed
with
utter
irrelevance
mere
snatches
from
ballets
composed
mainly
by
the
mountaineers
themselves
though
some
dated
back
to
a
age
when
the
british
ancestors
of
these
carolina
woodsmen
were
battling
with
lance
and
it
was
one
of
modern
and
local
origin
that
john
was
singing
when
there
came
a
diversion
from
without
down
boys
le
take
a
nap
thar
goin
to
be
trouble
in
the
cumberland
gap
our
ears
were
stunned
by
one
sudden
thundering
crash
the
roof
rose
visibly
as
though
pushed
upward
from
within
in
an
instant
we
were
blinded
by
moss
and
dried
mud
the
chinking
blown
from
between
the
logs
of
our
shabby
cabin
dred
and
coaly
cowered
as
though
whipped
while
doc
little
hound
slunk
away
in
the
keen
misery
of
fear
we
men
looked
at
each
other
with
lowered
eyelids
and
the
grim
smile
that
denotes
readiness
though
no
special
eagerness
for
dissolution
beyond
the
we
could
hear
trees
and
limbs
popping
like
skirmishers
in
action
then
that
tidal
wave
of
air
swept
by
the
roof
settled
again
with
only
a
few
shingles
missing
we
went
to
redding
up
squalls
broke
against
the
mountainside
hither
and
yon
like
the
hammer
of
thor
testing
the
foundations
of
the
earth
but
they
were
below
us
here
on
top
there
was
only
the
steady
drive
of
a
great
surge
of
wind
and
speech
was
possible
once
more
fellers
you
want
to
mark
whut
you
dream
about
hit
shore
come
true
yes
but
you
must
tell
whut
yer
dream
was
till
the
hunt
over
or
it
spile
the
charm
there
ensued
a
grave
discussion
of
in
which
the
illiterates
of
our
party
declared
solemn
faith
if
one
dreamt
of
blood
he
would
surely
see
blood
the
next
day
another
lucky
sign
for
a
hunter
was
to
dream
of
quarreling
with
a
woman
for
that
meant
a
it
was
favorable
to
dream
of
clear
water
but
muddy
water
meant
trouble
the
wind
died
away
when
we
went
out
for
a
last
observation
of
the
weather
we
found
the
air
so
clear
that
the
lights
of
knoxville
were
plainly
visible
in
the
west
miles
in
an
air
line
not
another
light
was
to
be
seen
on
earth
although
in
some
directions
we
could
scan
for
nearly
a
hundred
miles
the
moon
shone
brightly
things
looked
rather
favorable
for
the
morrow
after
all
i
awoke
to
a
knowledge
that
somebody
had
built
a
roaring
fire
and
was
stirring
about
between
the
cabin
logs
one
looked
out
upon
a
starry
sky
and
an
almost
world
what
did
that
pottering
vagabond
mean
by
arousing
us
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
i
was
hungry
everybody
half
arose
on
elbows
and
blinked
about
then
we
got
up
each
after
his
fashion
except
one
scamp
who
resumed
snoring
whar
that
brekfust
you
yellin
about
hit
for
to
help
i
knowed
i
could
roust
ye
no
other
way
here
you
go
down
to
the
spring
and
fetch
water
rustle
out
boys
we
got
to
git
a
soon
start
if
you
want
bear
brains
an
liver
for
supper
the
soon
start
tickled
me
into
good
humor
our
dogs
were
curled
together
under
the
long
bunk
having
popped
indoors
as
soon
as
the
way
was
opened
somebody
trod
on
coaly
tail
coaly
snapped
dred
instantly
there
was
action
between
the
four
it
is
interesting
to
observe
what
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
of
dog
can
do
to
a
ramshackle
berth
with
a
man
on
top
of
it
poles
and
hay
and
ragged
quilts
flew
in
every
direction
sleepy
matt
went
down
in
the
midst
of
the
mêlée
swearing
valiantly
i
went
out
and
hammered
ice
out
of
the
while
granville
and
john
quelled
the
riot
presently
our
sputtered
and
the
huge
began
to
get
up
steam
waal
who
dreamt
him
a
good
dream
i
did
affirmed
the
writer
i
dreamt
that
i
had
an
old
colored
woman
by
the
throat
and
was
choking
dollars
out
of
her
mouth
good
la
exclaimed
four
men
in
chorus
you
had
orter
why
was
that
a
lovely
dream
hit
means
a
shore
as
a
gun
but
you
done
spiled
it
all
by
tellin
mebbe
somebody
git
her
but
wo
your
chanct
is
ruined
so
the
reader
will
understand
why
in
this
veracious
narrative
i
can
not
relate
any
heroic
exploits
of
my
own
in
battling
with
ursus
major
and
so
you
ambitious
one
when
you
go
into
the
smokies
after
that
bear
remember
these
two
cardinal
points
of
the
law
dream
that
you
are
fighting
some
poor
old
colored
woman
that
is
easy
the
victuals
you
get
will
fix
up
your
dream
all
right
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
about
it
there
was
still
no
sign
of
in
the
eastern
sky
when
we
sallied
forth
the
ground
to
use
a
mountaineer
expression
was
all
spewed
up
with
frost
rime
crackled
underfoot
and
our
mustaches
soon
stiffened
in
the
icy
wind
it
was
settled
that
little
john
cable
and
the
hunchback
cope
should
take
the
dogs
far
down
into
bone
valley
and
start
the
drive
leaving
granville
doc
matt
and
myself
to
picket
the
mountain
i
was
given
a
stand
about
half
a
mile
east
of
the
cabin
and
had
but
a
vague
notion
of
where
the
others
went
by
jinks
it
was
cold
i
built
a
little
fire
between
the
buttressing
roots
of
a
big
mountain
oak
but
still
my
toes
and
fingers
were
numb
this
was
the
of
november
and
we
were
at
an
altitude
where
sometimes
frost
forms
in
july
the
other
men
were
more
thinly
clad
than
i
and
with
not
a
stitch
of
wool
beyond
their
stockings
but
they
seemed
to
revel
in
the
keen
air
i
wasted
some
pity
on
cope
who
had
no
underwear
worthy
of
the
name
but
afterwards
i
learned
that
he
would
not
have
worn
more
clothes
if
they
had
been
given
him
many
a
night
my
companions
had
slept
out
on
the
mountain
without
blanket
or
shelter
when
the
ground
froze
and
every
twig
in
the
forest
was
coated
with
rime
from
the
winter
fog
away
out
yonder
beyond
the
mighty
bulk
of
clingman
dome
which
black
with
spruce
and
balsam
looked
like
a
vast
bear
rising
to
contemplate
the
northern
world
there
streaked
the
first
faint
nebulous
hint
of
dawn
presently
the
big
bear
head
was
tipped
with
a
golden
crown
flashing
against
the
scarlet
fires
of
the
firmament
and
the
earth
awoke
a
rustling
some
hundred
yards
below
me
gave
signal
that
the
gray
squirrels
were
on
their
way
to
water
out
of
a
tree
overhead
hopped
a
mountain
boomer
red
squirrel
and
down
he
came
eyed
me
and
stopped
cocking
his
head
to
one
side
he
challenged
peremptorily
who
are
you
stump
stump
not
a
stump
what
the
deuce
i
moved
my
hand
lawk
the
run
run
run
somewhere
from
the
sky
came
a
strange
note
as
of
someone
chiding
i
could
get
no
view
for
the
trees
then
the
voice
flexibly
changed
to
a
that
rang
like
a
bell
through
the
forest
aisles
two
names
uttered
distinctly
from
the
air
two
scenes
conjured
in
a
breath
vivid
but
unrelated
as
in
dreams
wallace
an
scottish
coast
cologne
tall
spires
and
cliffs
along
the
rhine
what
magic
had
flashed
such
pictures
upon
a
remote
summit
of
the
smoky
mountains
the
weird
speaker
sailed
into
view
a
raven
forward
it
swept
with
great
speed
of
ebon
wings
fairly
within
gunshot
for
one
teasing
moment
then
as
if
to
mock
my
gaping
stupor
it
hurtled
like
a
hawk
far
into
the
safe
distance
whence
it
flung
back
loud
screams
of
defiance
and
chuckles
of
derision
as
the
morning
drew
on
i
let
the
fire
die
to
ashes
and
basked
lazily
in
the
sun
not
a
sound
had
i
heard
from
the
dogs
my
hoodoo
was
working
malignly
well
let
it
work
i
was
comfortable
now
and
that
old
bear
could
go
to
any
other
doom
she
preferred
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
lie
here
alone
in
the
forest
and
be
free
aye
it
was
good
to
be
alive
and
to
be
far
far
away
from
the
broken
bottles
and
old
tin
cans
of
civilization
illustration
by
and
by
up
they
came
carrying
the
bear
on
a
trimmed
sapling
for
many
a
league
to
the
southward
clouds
covered
all
the
valleys
in
billows
of
white
from
which
rose
a
hundred
mountain
tops
like
islands
in
a
tropic
ocean
my
fancy
sailed
among
and
beyond
them
beyond
the
horizon
rim
even
unto
those
far
seas
that
i
had
sailed
in
my
youth
to
the
old
times
and
the
old
friends
that
i
should
never
see
again
but
a
forenoon
is
when
one
has
breakfasted
before
dawn
and
has
nothing
to
do
but
sit
motionless
in
the
woods
and
watch
and
listen
i
got
to
fingering
my
rifle
trigger
impatiently
and
wishing
that
a
wild
thanksgiving
gobbler
might
blunder
into
view
squirrels
made
ceaseless
chatter
all
around
my
stand
large
hawks
shrilled
by
me
within
tempting
range
whistling
like
spent
bullets
a
groundhog
sat
up
on
a
log
and
whistled
too
after
a
manner
of
his
own
he
was
so
near
that
i
could
see
his
nose
wiggle
a
skunk
waddled
around
for
twenty
minutes
and
once
came
so
close
that
i
thought
he
would
nibble
my
boot
i
was
among
old
mossy
beeches
scaled
with
polyphori
and
twisted
into
postures
of
torture
by
their
battles
with
the
storms
below
among
chestnuts
and
birches
i
could
hear
the
of
towhees
which
winter
in
the
valleys
incessantly
came
the
of
ground
squirrels
the
saucy
bark
of
the
grays
and
great
chirruping
among
the
boomers
which
had
ceased
swearing
and
were
hard
at
work
far
off
on
my
left
a
rifle
cracked
i
pricked
up
and
listened
intently
but
there
was
never
a
yelp
from
a
dog
since
it
is
a
law
of
the
chase
to
fire
at
nothing
smaller
than
turkeys
lest
big
game
be
scared
away
this
shot
might
mean
a
gobbler
i
knew
that
matt
hyde
could
not
to
save
his
soul
sit
ten
minutes
on
a
stand
without
calling
turkeys
and
he
call
them
with
his
unassisted
mouth
better
than
anyone
i
ever
heard
perform
with
leaf
or
or
any
other
contrivance
thus
the
slow
hours
dragged
along
i
yearned
mightily
to
stretch
my
legs
finally
being
certain
that
no
drive
would
approach
my
stand
that
day
i
ambled
back
to
the
hut
and
did
a
turn
at
things
were
smoking
and
smelt
good
by
the
time
four
of
our
men
turned
up
all
of
them
and
disappointed
but
stoical
that
pup
coaly
chased
off
atter
a
wildcat
blurted
john
we
held
the
old
dogs
together
and
let
him
rip
then
dred
started
a
deer
it
was
that
old
buck
that
everybody
shot
at
and
missed
this
three
year
back
believe
he
a
hant
if
was
for
his
tracks
they
the
biggest
i
ever
seen
he
must
weigh
two
hunderd
and
fifty
but
he
a
foxy
cuss
tuk
right
down
the
bed
o
desolation
up
the
left
prong
of
roaring
fork
right
through
the
devil
how
a
deer
can
git
through
thar
i
do
see
crossed
at
the
meadow
gap
went
down
eagle
creek
and
by
now
he
in
the
little
tennessee
that
buck
shorely
to
god
has
wings
we
were
at
table
in
the
carolina
room
when
matt
hyde
appeared
sure
enough
he
bore
a
turkey
hen
i
was
callin
a
gobbler
when
this
fool
thing
showed
up
i
fired
a
shoot
as
she
riz
in
the
air
but
only
bruk
her
wing
she
made
off
on
her
legs
like
the
devil
whoppin
out
fire
i
run
an
she
run
guess
i
run
her
half
a
mile
through
thickets
she
piped
but
i
said
see
you
in
hell
afore
i
quit
and
the
chase
resumed
finally
i
knocked
her
over
with
a
birch
stob
and
here
we
are
matt
ruefully
surveyed
his
almost
denuded
legs
evidence
of
his
chase
boys
said
he
i
nigh
breechless
none
but
mountaineers
could
have
stood
the
strain
of
another
drive
that
day
for
the
country
that
cope
and
cable
had
been
through
was
fearful
especially
the
laurel
up
roaring
fork
and
killpeter
ridge
but
the
stamina
of
these
withey
little
men
was
even
more
remarkable
than
their
endurance
of
cold
after
a
small
slice
of
fried
pork
a
chunk
of
and
a
pint
or
so
of
coffee
they
were
as
fresh
as
ever
what
soldiers
these
fellows
would
make
under
leadership
of
some
backwoods
napoleon
who
could
hold
them
together
some
man
like
daniel
morgan
of
the
revolution
who
was
one
of
them
yet
greater
i
had
made
the
coffee
strong
and
it
was
good
stuff
that
i
had
brought
from
home
after
his
first
deep
draught
little
john
exclaimed
hah
boys
that
coffee
hits
whar
ye
hold
it
i
thought
that
a
neat
compliment
from
a
sharpshooter
we
took
new
stands
but
the
afternoon
passed
without
incident
to
those
of
us
on
the
mountain
tops
i
returned
to
camp
about
five
and
was
surprised
to
see
three
of
our
men
lugging
across
the
toward
the
cabin
a
small
female
bear
hyur
yer
old
nigger
woman
shouted
john
the
hunters
showed
no
elation
in
fact
they
looked
sheepish
and
i
suspected
a
nigger
in
the
woodpile
how
this
i
did
hear
any
drive
there
none
then
where
did
you
get
your
bear

one
of
wit
hensley

hot
coal

the
pup

i
examined
coaly
who
looked
sick
the
flesh
was
torn
from
his
lower
jaw
and
hung
down
a
couple
of
inches
two
holes
in
the
top
of
his
head
showed
where
the
bear
tusks
had
tried
to
crack
his
skull
when
the
other
dogs
found
her
he
rushed
right
in
she
had
been
trapped
a
few
hours
and
she
larned
coaly
somethin
about
the
bear
business
wo
this
spoil

two
words

la
whar
was
you
fotch
up
them
common
they

nigh
about
the
same
thing
only
there
a
differ
when
i
say
that
doc
jones
thar
is
brigaty
among
hit
means
that
he
stuck
on
hisself
and
wants
to
show

when
the
preacher

you
know
a
feist
is
one
o
them
little
bitty
dogs
that
ginerally
runs
on
three
legs
and
pretends
a
whole
lot
all
of
us
were
indignant
at
the
setter
of
the
trap
it
had
been
hidden
in
a
trail
with
no
sign
to
warn
a
man
from
stepping
into
it
in
tennessee
i
was
told
it
is
a
penitentiary
offense
to
set
out
a
bear
trap
we
agreed
that
a
similar
law
ought
to
be
passed
as
soon
as
possible
in
north
carolina
it
only
two
years
ago
said
granville
to
me
that
jasper
millington
an
old
man
living
on
the
tennessee
side
started
acrost
the
mountain
to
get
work
at
the
everett
mine
where
you
live
not
fur
from
where
we
are
now
he
stepped
into
a
bear
trap
that
was
hid
in
the
leaves
like
this
one
it
broke
his
leg
and
he
starved
to
death
in
it
despite
our
indignation
meeting
it
was
decided
to
carry
the
trapped
bear
hide
to
hensley
and
for
us
to
use
only
the
meat
as
recompense
for
trouble
to
say
nothing
of
risk
to
life
and
limb
such
is
the
mountaineers
regard
for
property
rights
the
animal
we
had
ingloriously
won
was
undersized
weighing
scant
pounds
the
average
weight
of
smoky
mountain
bears
is
not
great
but
occasionally
a
very
large
beast
is
killed
matt
hyde
told
us
that
he
killed
one
on
the
welch
divide
in
the
meat
of
which
dressed
without
the
hide
weighed
pounds
and
the
hide
squared
eight
feet
when
stretched
for
drying
doc
jones
killed
a
bear
that
was
kivered
with
fat
five
inches
thick
afterwards
i
took
pains
to
ask
the
most
famous
bear
hunters
of
our
region
what
were
the
largest
bears
they
had
personally
killed
uncle
jimmy
crawford
of
the
balsam
mountains
estimated
his
largest
at
pounds
gross
and
the
hide
of
another
that
he
had
killed
weighed
forty
pounds
after
three
days
drying
quill
rose
of
eagle
creek
said
that
after
stripping
the
hide
from
one
of
his
bears
he
took
the
fresh
skin
by
the
ears
and
raised
it
as
high
as
he
could
reach
above
his
head
and
that
four
inches
of
the
butt
end
of
the
hide
not
legs
trailed
on
the
ground
and
he
added
severely
thar
no
lie
about
it
quill
is
six
feet
one
and
inches
tall
black
bill
walker
of
the
middle
prong
of
little
river
tennessee
side
told
me
the
biggest
one
i
ever
saw
killed
had
a
hide
that
measured
ten
feet
from
nose
to
rump
stretched
for
drying
the
biggest
i
ever
killed
myself
measured
nine
and
a
half
feet
same
way
and
weighed
a
good
four
hundred
net
which
allowin
for
hide
blood
and
entrails
would
run
full
five
hunderd
live
weight
illustration
skinning
a
frozen
bear
within
the
past
two
years
two
bears
of
about
pounds
each
have
been
killed
in
swain
and
graham
counties
the
cables
getting
one
of
them
the
veteran
hunters
that
i
have
named
have
killed
their
hundreds
of
bears
and
are
men
superior
to
silly
exaggeration
in
the
smoky
mountains
the
black
bear
like
most
of
the
trees
attains
its
fullest
development
and
that
it
occasionally
reaches
a
weight
of
pounds
when
hog
fat
is
beyond
reasonable
doubt
though
the
average
would
not
be
more
than
half
that
weight
we
spent
the
evening
in
debate
as
to
where
the
next
drive
should
be
made
some
favored
moving
six
miles
eastward
to
the
old
mining
shack
at
siler
meadow
and
trying
the
headwaters
of
forney
creek
around
rip
shin
thicket
and
the
gunstick
laurel
driving
towards
clingman
dome
and
over
into
the
bleak
gulf
southwest
of
the
sugarland
mountains
that
i
had
named
godforsaken
a
title
that
stuck
we
knew
there
were
bears
in
that
region
though
it
was
a
desperately
rough
country
to
hunt
in
but
john
and
the
hunchback
had
found
sign
in
the
opposite
direction
bears
were
crossing
from
little
river
in
the
neighborhood
of
thunderhead
and
briar
knob
coming
up
just
west
of
the
devil
court
house
and
using
around
block
house
woolly
ridge
bear
pen
and
thereabouts
the
motion
carried
and
we
adjourned
to
bed
we
breakfasted
on
bear
meat
the
remains
of
our
thanksgiving
turkey
and
wheat
bread
shortened
with
bear
grease
until
it
was
light
as
a
feather
and
i
made
tea
it
was
the
first
time
that
little
john
ever
saw
store
tea
he
swallowed
some
of
it
as
if
it
had
been
boneset
under
the
impression
that
it
was
some
sort
of
yerb
that
would
be
good
for
his
insides
without
praising
its
flavor
he
asked
what
it
had
cost
and
when
i
told
him
a
dollar
a
pound
reckoned
that
it
was
rich
man
medicine
said
he
preferred
dittany
or
sassafras
or
goldenrod
doc
jones
opined
that
it
looked
yaller
and
he
even
affirmed
that
it
tasted
yaller
waal
people
exclaimed
matt
i
i
done
growed
a
bit
atter
that
mess
o
meat
le
be
movin
it
was
a
hard
pull
for
me
climbing
up
the
rocky
approach
to
briar
knob
this
was
my
first
trip
to
the
main
divide
and
my
heart
was
not
yet
used
to
mountain
climbing
the
boys
were
anxious
for
me
to
get
a
shot
i
was
paying
them
nothing
it
was
alike
but
their
neighborly
kindness
moved
them
to
do
their
best
for
the
outlander
so
they
put
me
on
what
was
probably
the
best
stand
for
the
day
it
was
above
the
a
brulé
or
space
on
the
steep
southern
side
of
the
ridge
between
briar
knob
and
laurel
top
overlooking
the
grisly
slope
of
killpeter
here
i
could
both
see
and
hear
an
uncommonly
long
distance
and
if
the
bear
went
either
east
or
west
i
would
have
timely
warning
this
by
the
way
is
a
famous
place
for
wildcats
once
in
a
blue
moon
a
lynx
is
killed
in
the
highest
zone
of
the
smokies
up
among
the
balsams
and
spruces
where
both
the
flora
and
fauna
as
well
as
the
climate
resemble
those
of
the
canadian
woods
our
native
hunters
never
heard
the
word
lynx
but
call
the
animal
a
catamount
wolves
and
panthers
used
to
be
common
here
but
it
is
a
long
time
since
either
has
been
killed
in
this
region
albeit
impressionable
people
see
wolf
tracks
or
hear
a
scream
every
now
and
then
i
had
shivered
on
the
mountain
top
for
a
couple
of
hours
hearing
only
an
occasional
yelp
from
the
dogs
which
had
been
working
in
the
thickets
a
mile
or
so
below
me
when
suddenly
there
burst
forth
the
devil
of
a
racket
on
came
the
chase
right
in
my
direction
presently
i
could
distinguish
the
different
notes
the
deep
bellow
of
old
dred
the
baying
of
rock
and
coaly
and
little
towse
feisty
yelp
i
thought
that
the
bear
might
chance
the
comparatively
open
space
of
the
because
there
were
still
some
ashes
on
the
ground
that
would
dust
the
dogs
nostrils
and
throw
them
off
the
scent
and
such
i
believe
was
his
intention
but
the
dogs
caught
up
with
him
they
nipped
him
fore
and
aft
time
after
time
he
shook
them
off
but
they
were
true
bear
dogs
and
like
matt
hyde
after
the
turkey
they
knew
no
such
word
as
quit
i
took
a
last
squint
at
my
rifle
sights
made
sure
there
was
a
cartridge
in
the
chamber
and
then
felt
my
ears
grow
as
i
listened
suddenly
the
chase
swerved
at
a
right
angle
and
took
straight
up
the
side
of
either
the
bear
would
tree
or
he
would
try
to
smash
on
through
to
the
low
rhododendron
of
the
devil
court
house
where
dogs
who
followed
might
break
their
legs
i
girded
myself
and
ran
wiggling
and
wingling
along
the
main
divide
and
then
came
the
steep
pull
up
briar
knob
as
i
was
grading
around
the
summit
with
all
the
lope
that
was
left
in
me
i
heard
a
rifle
crack
half
a
mile
down
old
doc
was
somewhere
in
that
vicinity
i
halted
to
listen
creation
what
a
rumpus
then
another
shot
then
the
warwhoop
of
the
south
that
we
read
about
by
and
by
up
they
came
john
and
cope
and
doc
two
at
a
time
carrying
the
bear
on
a
trimmed
sapling
presently
hyde
joined
us
then
came
granville
and
we
filed
back
to
camp
where
doc
told
his
story
boys
them
dogs
eyes
shined
like
new
money
coaly
fit
agin
all
right
and
got
his
tail
bit
the
bear
div
down
into
a
with
the
dogs
o
him
soon
i
could
shoot
without
hittin
a
dog
i
let
him
have
it
thought
i
shot
him
through
the
head
but
he
fit
on
then
i
jumped
down
into
the
sink
and
kicked
him
loose
from
the
dogs
or
he
coaly
waal
sir
he
hurt
a
bit
the
ball
jest
glanced
off
his
head
he
riz
an
knocked
me
down
with
his
left
paw
an
walked
right
over
me
an
lit
up
the
ridge
the
dogs
treed
him
in
a
minute
i
went
to
shoot
up
at
him
but
my
new
hulls
cartridges
fit
loose
in
this
old
chamber
and
this
one
drap
dropped
out
so
the
gun
stuck
had
to
git
my
knife
out
and
fix
hit
then
the
gun
would
stand
roostered
cocked
the
had
jumped
out
o
place
but
i
held
back
with
my
thumb
and
killed
him
anyhow
fellers
he
added
feelingly
i
wish
t
my
legs
growed
fer
so
i
would
bark
my
shins
bears
remarked
john
is
all
ever
note
that
hit
the
left
paw
you
wanter
look
out
fer
he
somethin
out
o
yer
head
if
there
been
much
in
it
doc
funny
thing
but
hit
true
declared
bill
that
a
bear
allers
dies
flat
on
his
back
onless
he
trapped
so
do
men
said
doc
grimly
men
who
been
shot
in
battle
you
go
along
a
battlefield
right
atter
the
action
and
you
find
most
o
the
dead
faces
pintin
to
the
sky
bears
is
almost
human
anyhow
a
skinned
bear
looks
like
a
great
man
with
long
arms
and
stumpy
legs
i
did
not
relish
this
turn
of
the
conversation
for
we
had
two
bears
to
skin
immediately
the
one
that
had
been
hung
up
over
night
was
frozen
solid
so
i
photographed
her
standing
on
her
legs
as
in
life
when
it
came
to
skinning
this
beast
the
job
was
a
mean
one
a
fellow
had
to
drop
out
now
and
then
to
warm
his
fingers
the
mountaineers
have
an
odd
way
of
sharing
the
spoils
of
the
chase
they
call
it
stoking
the
meat
a
use
of
the
word
that
i
have
never
heard
elsewhere
the
hide
is
sold
and
the
proceeds
divided
equally
among
the
hunters
but
the
meat
is
cut
up
into
as
many
pieces
as
there
are
partners
in
the
chase
then
one
man
goes
indoors
or
behind
a
tree
and
somebody
at
the
carcass
laying
his
hand
on
a
portion
calls
out
whose
piece
is
this
granville
calhoun
cries
the
hidden
man
who
can
not
see
it
whose
is
this
bill
cope
and
so
on
down
the
line
everybody
gets
what
chance
determines
for
him
and
there
can
be
no
charges
of
unfairness
it
turned
very
cold
that
night
the
last
thing
i
heard
was
matt
hyde
protesting
to
the
hunchback
durn
you
bill
cope
you
so
cussed
crooked
a
man
cai
lay
cluss
enough
to
you
to
keep
warm
once
when
i
awoke
in
the
night
the
beech
trees
were
cracking
like
from
the
intense
frost
next
morning
john
announced
that
we
were
going
to
get
another
bear
night
afore
last
he
said
bill
dremp
that
he
seed
a
lot
o
fat
meat
layin
on
the
table
an
it
done
come
true
last
night
i
dremp
me
one
that
never
was
knowed
to
fail
yet
now
you
see
it
did
not
look
like
it
by
evening
we
all
worked
hard
and
endured
much
standers
as
well
as
drivers
but
not
a
rifle
had
spoken
up
to
the
time
when
from
my
stand
i
yearned
for
a
hot
supper
away
down
in
the
rear
i
heard
the
snort
of
a
locomotive
one
of
those
affairs
that
are
specially
built
for
mountain
climbing
with
a
and
three
camps
of
a
hundred
men
each
it
was
despoiling
the
tennessee
forest
slowly
but
inexorably
a
leviathan
was
crawling
into
the
wilderness
and
was
soon
to
consume
it
illustration
steep
and
laurely
all
this
i
apostrophized
shall
be
swept
away
tree
and
plant
beast
and
fish
fire
will
blacken
the
earth
flood
will
swallow
and
spew
forth
the
soil
the
native
men
and
women
will
scatter
and
disappear
in
their
stead
will
come
slaves
speaking
strange
tongues
to
toil
in
the
darkness
under
the
rocks
soot
will
arise
and
foul
gases
the
streams
will
run
murky
death
let
me
not
see
it
no
i
will
get
me
to
some
land
where
higher
mountains
under
heaven
stand
where
other
thunders
roll
amid
the
hills
some
mightier
wind
a
mightier
forest
fills
with
other
strains
through
boughs
wearily
i
plodded
back
to
camp
no
one
had
arrived
but
doc
the
old
man
had
been
thumped
rather
severely
in
yesterday
scrimmage
but
complained
only
of
a
touch
o
rheumatiz
just
how
this
disease
had
left
his
clothes
in
tatters
he
did
not
explain
it
was
late
when
matt
and
granville
came
in
the
crimson
and
yellow
of
sunset
had
turned
to
a
faultless
turquoise
and
this
to
a
violet
afterglow
then
suddenly
night
rose
from
the
valleys
and
enveloped
us
about
nine
i
went
out
on
the
little
chestnut
bald
and
fired
signals
but
there
was
no
answer
the
last
we
had
known
of
the
drivers
was
that
they
had
been
beyond
thunderhead
six
miles
of
hard
travel
to
the
westward
there
was
fog
on
the
mountain
we
did
some
uneasy
speculating
then
granville
and
matt
took
the
lantern
and
set
out
for
briar
knob
doc
was
too
stiff
for
travel
and
i
being
at
that
time
a
stranger
in
the
smokies
would
be
of
no
use
hunting
amid
clouds
and
darkness
doc
and
i
passed
a
dreary
three
hours
finally
at
midnight
my
shots
were
answered
and
soon
the
dogs
came
limping
in
dred
had
been
severely
bitten
in
the
shoulders
and
rock
in
the
head
coaly
was
bloody
about
the
mouth
where
his
first
day
wound
had
reopened
then
came
the
four
men
it
seemed
until
john
slapped
a
bear
melt
spleen
upon
the
table
he
limped
from
a
bruised
hip
that
bear
outsharped
us
and
went
around
all
o
we
follered
him
clar
over
to
the
spencer
place
and
then
he
doubled
and
come
back
on
the
fur
side
o
the
ridge
he
crossed
through
the
laurel
on
the
court
house
and
tuk
down
an
almighty
steep
place
it
was
plumb
night
by
that
time
i
fell
over
a
rock
clift
twenty
feet
down
and
if
been
for
the
laurel
i
some
bones
i
landed
right
in
the
middle
of
them
bear
and
dogs
fightin
like
gamecocks
the
bear
clim
a
tree
bill
sung
out
it
fur
down
thar
and
i
said
fur
says
he
and
with
that
he
grabbed
a
laurel
to
swing
hisself
down
by
but
the
stem
bruk
and
down
he
come
suddent
to
jine
the
music
hit
was
so
dark
i
could
see
my
gun
barrel
and
we
wuz
all
tangled
up
in
greenbriers
as
thick
as
ploughlines
i
had
to
fire
twiste
afore
he
tumbled
then
matt
an
granville
come

four
of
us

at
a
time
and

bear

near

bodaciously
tired

time

i
promise

rest

holler

john
what
was
that
dream
of
yours
i
dremp
i
stole
a
feller
overcoat
now
d
see
that
means
a
hide
coaly
three
days
ago
had
been
an
inconsequential
pup
but
now
he
looked
up
into
my
eyes
with
the
calm
dignity
that
no
fool
or
braggart
can
assume
he
had
been
knighted
as
he
licked
his
wounds
he
was
proud
of
them
scars
of
battle
sir
you
may
have
your
swagger
ribbons
and
prize
collars
in
the
new
york
dog
show
but
for
me
poor
coaly
after
two
more
years
of
valiant
service
he
was
to
meet
an
evil
fortune
in
connection
with
it
i
will
relate
a
queer
coincidence
two
years
after
this
hunt
a
friend
and
i
spent
three
summer
months
in
this
same
old
cabin
on
top
of
smoky
when
andy
had
to
return
north
he
left
with
me
for
sale
a
carbine
as
he
had
more
guns
than
he
needed
i
showed
this
carbine
to
quill
rose
and
the
old
hunter
said
i
do
like
them
you
could
shoot
clar
through
a
bear
and
kill
your
dog
on
the
other
side
the
next
day
i
sold
the
weapon
to
granville
calhoun
within
a
short
time
word
came
from
granville
father
that
old
reelfoot
was
despoiling
his
orchard
this
reelfoot
was
a
large
bear
whose
cunning
had
defied
our
best
hunters
for
five
or
six
years
he
got
his
name
from
the
fact
that
he
reeled
or
twisted
his
hind
feet
in
walking
as
some
horses
do
leaving
a
peculiar
track
this
seems
rather
common
among
old
bears
for
i
have
known
of
several
reelfoots
in
other
and
widely
separated
regions
cable
and
his
dogs
were
sent
for
a
drive
was
made
and
the
bear
was
actually
caught
within
a
few
rods
of
old
calhoun
stable
his
teeth
were
worn
to
the
gums
and
as
he
could
no
longer
kill
hogs
he
had
come
down
to
an
apple
diet
he
was
but
very
poor
the
only
hunters
on
the
spot
were
granville
with
the
and
a
northern
lumberman
named
hastings
with
a
luger
carbine
after
two
or
three
shots
had
wounded
the
bear
he
rose
on
his
hind
feet
and
made
for
granville
a
bullet
went
clear
through
the
beast
at
the
very
instant
that
coaly
who
was
unseen
jumped
up
on
the
log
behind
it
and
the
missile
gave
both
animals
their
death
wound
chapter
v
moonshine
land
i
was
hunting
alone
in
the
mountains
and
exploring
ground
that
was
new
to
me
about
noon
while
descending
from
a
high
ridge
into
a
creek
valley
to
get
some
water
i
became
enmeshed
in
a
rhododendron
slick
and
to
some
extent
lost
my
bearings
after
floundering
about
for
an
hour
or
two
i
suddenly
came
out
upon
a
little
clearing
giant
hemlocks
girdled
and
gaunt
rose
from
a
steep
cornfield
of
five
acres
beyond
which
loomed
the
primeval
forest
of
the
great
smoky
mountains
squat
in
the
foreground
sat
one
of
the
rudest
log
huts
i
had
ever
seen
a
tiny
shack
without
window
cellar
or
loft
and
without
a
sawed
board
showing
in
its
construction
a
thin
curl
of
smoke
rose
from
one
end
of
the
cabin
not
from
a
chimney
but
from
a
mere
of
stones
piled
four
feet
high
around
a
hole
cut
through
the
log
wall
the
stones
of
this
fireplace
were
not
even
plastered
together
with
mud
nor
had
the
builder
ever
intended
to
raise
the
pile
as
high
as
the
roof
to
guard
his
premises
against
the
imminent
risk
of
fire
two
low
doors
of
riven
boards
stood
wide
open
opposite
each
other
these
helped
by
wide
crevices
between
the
unchinked
logs
served
to
let
in
some
sunlight
and
quite
too
much
of
the
raw
november
air
the
surroundings
were
squalid
and
filthy
beyond
anything
i
had
hitherto
witnessed
in
the
mountains
as
i
approached
wading
in
muck
that
reached
to
the
doorsill
two
pigs
scampered
out
through
the
opposite
door
within
the
hut
i
found
only
a
slip
of
a
girl
rocking
a
baby
almost
as
big
as
herself
and
trying
to
knit
a
sock
at
the
same
time
she
was
toasting
her
bare
toes
before
the
fire
and
crooning
in
a
weird
minor
some
mountain
ditty
that
may
have
been
centuries
old
i
shivered
as
i
looked
at
this
midget
comparing
her
only
garment
a
torn
calico
dress
with
my
own
stout
hunter
garb
that
seemed
none
too
warm
for
such
a
day
as
this
knowing
that
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
stranger
would
startle
the
girl
i
chose
the
quickest
way
to
reassure
her
by
saluting
in
the
vernacular
howdy
howdy
she
gasped
who
lives
here
tom
kirby
kirby
oh
yes
i
know
him
we
been
hunting
together
is
your
father
at
home
no
he
out
somewheres
where
is
your
mother
she
in
the
field
up
yan
gittin
roughness
i
took
some
pride
in
not
being
stumped
by
this
answer
roughness
in
mountain
lingo
is
any
kind
of
rough
fodder
specifically
corn
fodder
how
far
is
it
to
the
next
house
i
do
know
maw
she
knows
all
right
i
find
her
i
went
up
to
the
field
no
one
was
in
sight
but
a
shock
of
fodder
was
walking
away
from
me
and
i
conjectured
that
maw
feet
were
under
it
so
i
hailed
hello
the
shock
turned
around
then
tumbled
over
and
there
stood
revealed
a
woman
coarse
featured
but
of
superb
physique
one
of
those
mountain
giantesses
who
think
nothing
of
shouldering
a
sack
of
corn
and
carrying
it
a
mile
or
two
without
letting
it
down
illustration
moonshine
hidden
in
the
laurel
she
flushed
then
paled
staring
at
me
frightened
i
thought
by
this
apparition
of
a
stranger
whose
approach
she
had
not
detected
to
these
people
of
the
far
backwoods
everyone
from
outside
their
mountains
is
a
doubtful
character
at
best
however
mistress
kirby
quickly
recovered
her
aplomb
her
mouth
straightened
to
a
thin
slit
she
planted
herself
squarely
across
my
path
now
regarding
me
with
contracted
lids
and
a
hard
glint
till
i
felt
fairly
bayoneted
by
those
eyes
is
kirby
about
i
inquired
there
was
no
answer
instead
the
thin
slit
opened
and
let
out
a
yell
of
almost
yodel
quality
penetrating
as
a
warwhoop
a
yell
that
would
carry
near
half
a
mile
i
wondered
what
she
meant
by
this
but
she
did
not
enlighten
me
by
so
much
as
a
single
word
it
was
puzzling
not
to
say
disconcerting
but
charging
it
to
the
custom
of
a
country
that
still
was
new
to
me
i
found
my
tongue
again
and
started
to
give
credentials
my
name
is
kephart
i
am
staying
at
the
everett
mine
on
sugar
fork
another
yell
that
set
the
wild
echoes
flying
i
am
acquainted
with
your
husband
we
hunted
together
perhaps
he
has
told
you
yell
number
three
same
pitch
and
vigor
as
before
by
this
time
i
was
quite
nonplussed
i
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
never
a
word
did
the
woman
deign
so
there
we
stood
and
stared
at
each
other
in
silence
i
leaning
on
my
rifle
she
with
red
arms
akimbo
till
i
grew
embarrassed
half
wondering
too
if
the
creature
were
demented
suddenly
a
light
flashed
upon
my
groping
wits
this
amazon
was
on
picket
her
three
shrieks
had
been
a
signal
to
someone
up
the
branch
her
attitude
showed
that
there
was
no
thoroughfare
in
that
direction
at
present
circumstances
whatever
they
were
forbade
explanation
clearly
the
woman
thought
that
i
could
not
help
seeing
how
matters
stood
not
for
a
moment
did
she
suspect
but
that
her
yells
her
belligerent
attitude
and
her
refusal
to
speak
were
the
conventional
way
this
world
over
of
intimating
that
there
was
a
she
considered
that
if
i
was
what
i
claimed
to
be
an
acquaintance
of
her
husband
and
on
friendly
footing
i
would
be
gentleman
enough
to
retire
if
i
was
something
else
an
officer
a
spy
well
she
was
there
to
stop
me
until
the
captain
of
the
guard
arrived
for
one
silly
moment
i
was
tempted
to
advance
and
see
what
this
martial
spouse
would
do
if
i
tried
to
pass
her
on
the
trail
but
a
instinct
made
me
glance
forward
to
the
upper
corner
of
the
field
there
was
thick
cover
beyond
the
fence
with
a
clear
range
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
between
it
and
me
too
far
for
tom
to
recognize
me
i
thought
but
deadly
range
for
his
winchester
i
knew
one
forward
step
of
mine
would
put
me
in
the
status
of
an
armed
intruder
so
i
concluded
that
common
sense
would
better
become
me
at
this
juncture
than
a
bit
of
fooling
that
surely
would
be
misinterpreted
and
that
might
end
ingloriously
ah
well
i
remarked
when
your
husband
gets
back
tell
him
please
that
i
was
sorry
to
miss
him
though
i
did
not
call
on
any
special
business
just
wanted
to
say
you
know
good
day
i
turned
and
went
down
the
valley
all
the
way
home
i
speculated
on
this
queer
adventure
what
was
going
on
up
yan
a
month
before
when
i
had
started
for
this
wildest
nook
of
the
smokies
a
friend
had
intimated
that
i
was
venturing
into
a
dubious
district
moonshine
land
it
is
but
frank
to
confess
that
this
prospect
was
not
unpleasant
my
only
fear
had
been
that
i
might
not
find
any
moonshiners
or
that
having
found
them
i
might
not
succeed
in
winning
their
confidence
to
the
extent
of
learning
their
own
side
of
an
interesting
story
as
to
how
i
could
do
this
without
getting
tarred
with
the
same
stick
i
was
by
no
means
clear
but
i
hoped
that
good
luck
might
find
a
way
and
now
it
seemed
as
if
luck
had
indeed
favored
me
with
an
excuse
for
broaching
the
topic
to
some
friendly
mountaineer
so
i
could
at
least
see
how
he
would
take
it
and
it
chanced
or
was
it
chance
that
i
had
no
more
than
finished
supper
that
evening
when
a
man
called
at
my
lonely
cabin
he
was
the
one
that
i
knew
best
among
my
scattered
neighbors
i
gave
him
a
rather
humorous
account
of
my
reception
by
madame
kirby
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
she
was
yelling
about
there
was
no
answering
smile
on
my
visitor
face
he
pondered
in
silence
weighing
many
contingencies
it
seemed
and
ventured
no
more
than
a
helpless
waal
now
i
wonder
it
did
not
suit
me
to
let
the
matter
go
at
that
so
on
a
sudden
impulse
i
fired
the
question
at
him
do
you
suppose
that
tom
is
running
a
still
up
there
at
the
head
of
that
little
cove
the
man
face
hardened
and
there
came
a
glint
into
his
eyes
such
as
i
had
noticed
in
mistress
kirby
jedgmatically
i
do
know
excuse
me
i
do
want
to
know
either
but
let
me
explain
just
what
i
am
driving
at
people
up
north
and
in
the
lowlands
of
the
south
as
well
have
a
notion
that
there
is
little
or
nothing
going
on
in
these
mountains
except
feuds
and
moonshining
they
think
that
a
stranger
traveling
here
alone
is
in
danger
of
being
potted
by
a
bullet
from
almost
any
laurel
thicket
that
he
passes
on
mere
suspicion
that
he
may
be
a
revenue
officer
or
a
spy
of
course
that
is
nonsense
but
there
is
one
thing
that
i
as
ignorant
about
as
any
of
them
all
you
know
my
habits
i
like
to
explore
i
never
take
a
guide
and
when
i
come
to
a
place
that
particularly
wild
and
primitive
that
just
the
place
i
want
to
peer
into
now
the
dubious
point
is
this
suppose
that
one
of
these
days
when
i
out
hunting
or
looking
for
rare
plants
i
should
stumble
upon
a
moonshine
still
in
full
operation
what
would
happen
what
would
they
do
waal
sir
i
tell
you
whut
they
do
they
ask
you
some
questions
about
yourself
and
whut
was
doin
in
that
thar
neck
o
the
woods
then
they
git
you
to
do
some
triflin
work
about
the
still
feed
the
furnace
or
stir
the
mash
jest
so
they
could
prove
that
you
took
a
hand
in
it
your
own
self
what
good
would
that
do
hit
would
make
you
one
o
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
i
see
but
really
does
that
seem
rather
childish
i
could
easily
convince
any
court
that
i
did
it
under
compulsion
for
that
what
it
would
amount
to
i
reckon
would
find
a
united
states
court
purty
hard
to
convince
the
judge
right
up
and
want
to
know
why
you
let
grass
go
to
seed
afore
you
came
and
informed
on
them
he
paused
watched
my
expression
and
then
continued
quizzically
i
reckon
you
would
be
in
no
great
hurry
to
do
no
then
if
i
stirred
the
mash
and
sampled
their
liquor
nobody
would
be
likely
to
mistreat
me
shucks
why
man
whut
could
they
gain
by
hurtin
you
at
the
wust
they
was
convicted
by
your
own
evidence
they
only
git
a
month
or
two
in
the
pen
so
why
should
they
murder
you
and
get
hung
for
it
hit
all
foolishness
the
notions
some
folks
has
i
thought
so
now
here
the
public
has
been
fed
all
sorts
of
nonsense
about
this
moonshining
business
i
like
to
learn
the
plain
truth
about
it
without
bias
one
way
or
the
other
i
have
no
curiosity
about
personal
affairs
and
do
want
to
learn
incriminating
details
but
i
would
like
to
know
how
the
business
is
conducted
and
especially
how
it
is
regarded
from
the
mountain
people
own
point
of
view
i
have
already
learned
that
a
stranger
life
and
property
are
safer
here
than
they
would
be
on
the
streets
of
chicago
or
of
louis
it
will
do
your
country
good
to
have
that
known
but
i
ca
say
that
there
is
no
moonshining
going
on
here
for
a
man
with
a
wooden
nose
could
smell
it
now
what
is
your
excuse
for
defying
the
law
you
do
seem
ashamed
of
it
the
man
face
turned
an
angry
red
mister
hai
no
call
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
nor
of
ary
thing
we
do
we
poor
but
we
do
ax
no
favors
we
stay
up
hyar
in
these
coves
and
mind
our
own
business
when
a
stranger
comes
along
he
welcome
to
the
best
we
got
such
as
is
but
if
he
imposes
on
us
he
gits
his
medicine
purty
damned
quick
and
you
think
the
government
tax
on
whiskey
is
an
imposition
hit
is
under
some
sarcumstances
my
guest
stretched
his
legs
and
jedgmatically
proceeded
to
enlighten
me
thar
plenty
o
men
and
women
grown
in
these
mountains
who
know
that
the
government
is
ary
thing
but
a
president
in
a
biled
shirt
who
commands
judges
and
a
gang
o
revenue
officers
they
know
thar
a
president
because
the
men
folks
voted
for
him
and
the
women
folks
seed
his
pictur
they
heered
tell
about
the
judges
and
they
seed
the
revenuers
in
flesh
and
blood
they
believe
in
supportin
the
government
because
hit
the
law
nobody
refuses
to
pay
his
taxes
for
taxes
is
fair
and
squar
taxes
cost
mebbe
three
cents
on
the
dollar
and
that
all
right
but
revenue
costs
a
dollar
and
ten
cents
on
twenty
cents
worth
o
liquor
and
that
robbin
the
people
with
a
gun
to
their
faces
of
course
i
ai
so
ignorant
as
all
that
i
traveled
about
the
country
been
to
asheville
wunst
and
to
waynesville
a
heap
times
and
i
know
the
theory
theory
says
revenue
is
a
tax
on
luxury
waal
that
all
right
anything
in
reason
the
big
fellers
that
makes
lots
of
money
out
o
stillin
and
lives
in
luxury
ought
to
pay
handsome
for
it
but
who
ever
seen
luxury
cavortin
around
in
these
smoky
mountains
illustration
moonshine
mill
side
view
the
trails
that
lead
hither
are
blind
and
rough
behind
the
mill
rises
an
almost
precipitous
much
of
the
corn
is
brought
in
on
men
backs
at
the
dead
of
night
he
paused
for
a
reply
even
then
with
my
limited
experience
in
the
mountains
i
could
not
help
wincing
at
the
idea
often
in
later
times
this
man
question
came
back
to
me
with
peculiar
force
luxury
in
a
land
where
the
little
stores
were
often
out
of
coffee
sugar
kerosene
and
even
salt
where
in
dead
of
winter
there
was
no
meal
much
less
flour
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
luxury
where
i
had
to
live
on
tough
old
sow
bear
for
six
weeks
because
the
only
side
of
pork
that
i
could
find
for
sale
was
full
of
maggots
my
friend
continued
whiskey
means
more
to
us
mountain
folks
than
hit
does
to
folks
in
town
whar
thar
and
doctors
let
ary
thing
go
wrong
in
the
fever
or
snake
bite
or
somethin
and
we
ca
git
a
doctor
up
hyar
three
days
and
it
costs
the
only
medicines
has
is
yerbs
which
customarily
ai
no
good
a
leetle
grain
o
whiskey
now
ai
no
saloons
allowed
in
all
these
western
counties
the
nighest
state
dispensary
even
is
sixty
miles
away
the
law
wunt
let
us
have
liquor
shipped
to
us
from
anywhars
in
the
state
if
we
git
it
sent
to
us
from
outside
the
state
it
has
to
come
by
express
and
old
it
is
too
so
to
be
good
citizens
must
travel
back
and
forth
at
a
heap
of
expense
or
pay
express
rates
on
pizened
liquor
and
we
are
too
durned
poor
to
do
ary
one
or
now
yan
my
field
o
corn
i
gather
the
corn
and
shuck
hit
and
grind
hit
my
own
self
and
the
woman
she
bakes
us
a
pone
o
bread
to
eat
and
i
do
pay
no
tax
do
i
then
why
ca
i
make
some
o
my
corn
into
pure
whiskey
to
drink
without
payin
tax
i
tell
you
this
way
the
government
does
but
when
all
said
and
done
the
main
reason
for
this
as
calls
it
is
bad
roads
bad
roads
i
exclaimed
what
the
jest
thisaway
from
hyar
to
the
railroad
is
seventeen
miles
with
two
mountains
to
cross
and
you
seed
that
road
i
recollect
said
every
one
o
them
miles
was
a
thousand
rods
long
nobody
ever
measured
them
except
by
mountain
man
big
feet
and
a
long
stride
between
seven
hundred
pounds
is
all
the
load
a
good
team
can
haul
over
that
road
when
the
weather
good
hit
takes
three
days
to
make
the
round
trip
you
break
an
axle
and
then
hit
takes
four
when
you
do
git
to
the
railroad
ai
no
town
of
a
thousand
people
within
fifty
mile
now
us
folks
ai
even
got
wagons
thar
only
one
sarviceable
wagon
in
this
whole
settlement
and
you
ca
hire
it
without
team
and
driver
which
is
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
day
whar
one
o
our
leetle
sleds
ca
go
we
haffter
pack
on
or
tussle
it
on
our
own
wethers
look
then
the
only
farm
produce
can
sell
is
corn
you
see
for
yourself
that
corn
ca
be
shipped
outen
hyar
we
can
trade
hit
for
store
credit
that
all
corn
is
about
all
we
can
tote
around
over
the
country
and
git
cash
money
for
why
man
the
only
way
some
folks
has
o
payin
their
taxes
but
aside
from
the
work
and
the
worry
i
remarked
there
is
the
danger
of
being
shot
in
this
business
oh
do
lay
up
agin
the
government
hit
as
fair
for
one
as
is
for
when
a
revenuer
comes
sneakin
around
why
whut
he
gits
or
whut
gits
that
a
of
war
as
the
old
sayin
is
there
is
no
telegraph
wired
or
wireless
in
the
mountains
but
there
is
an
efficient
substitute
it
seemed
as
though
in
one
night
the
news
traveled
from
valley
to
cove
and
from
cove
to
nook
that
i
was
investigating
the
moonshining
business
and
that
i
was
apparently
safe
each
individual
interpreted
that
word
to
suit
himself
some
regarded
me
askance
others
were
so
confiding
that
their
very
frankness
threatened
at
times
to
become
embarrassing
thereafter
i
had
many
talks
and
adventures
with
men
who
at
one
time
or
other
had
been
engaged
in
the
moonshining
industry
some
of
these
men
had
known
the
inside
of
the
penitentiary
some
were
not
without
i
doubt
not
that
more
than
one
of
them
could
even
now
find
his
way
through
night
and
fog
and
laurel
thicket
to
some
beautiful
piece
of
copper
that
has
not
yet
been
punched
full
of
holes
they
knew
that
i
was
on
friendly
terms
with
revenue
agents
what
was
worse
they
knew
that
i
was
a
scribbler
more
than
once
i
took
notes
in
their
presence
while
interviewing
them
and
we
had
the
frankest
understanding
as
to
what
would
become
of
those
notes
my
immunity
was
not
due
to
any
promises
made
or
hostages
given
for
there
were
none
i
did
not
even
pose
as
an
apologist
but
merely
volunteered
to
give
a
fair
report
of
what
i
heard
and
saw
they
took
me
at
my
word
had
i
used
such
representations
as
a
mask
and
secretly
played
the
spy
or
informer
well
i
would
have
deserved
whatever
might
have
befallen
me
as
it
was
i
never
met
with
any
but
respectful
treatment
from
these
gentry
nor
to
the
best
of
my
belief
did
they
ever
tell
me
a
lie
chapter
vi
ways
that
are
dark
our
terms
moonshiner
and
moonshining
are
not
used
in
the
mountains
here
an
illicit
distiller
is
called
a
blockader
his
business
is
blockading
and
the
product
is
blockade
liquor
just
as
the
smugglers
of
old
britain
called
themselves
thereby
proclaiming
that
they
risked
and
fought
for
a
principle
so
the
moonshiner
considers
himself
simply
a
dealing
in
contraband
his
offense
is
only
not
in
there
are
two
kinds
of
blockaders
big
and
little
the
big
blockader
makes
unlicensed
whiskey
on
a
fairly
large
scale
he
may
have
several
stills
operating
alternately
in
different
places
so
as
to
avert
suspicion
in
any
case
the
still
is
large
and
the
output
is
quite
profitable
the
owner
himself
may
not
actively
engage
in
the
work
but
may
furnish
the
capital
and
hire
confederates
to
do
the
distilling
for
him
so
that
personally
he
shuns
the
appearance
of
evil
these
big
fellows
are
rare
they
are
the
ones
who
seek
collusion
with
the
of
government
officialdom
or
failing
in
that
instruct
their
minions
to
kill
on
sight
the
little
moonshiner
is
a
more
interesting
character
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
fights
fair
according
to
his
code
and
against
tremendous
odds
he
is
innocent
of
graft
there
is
nothing
between
him
and
the
whole
power
of
the
federal
government
except
his
own
wits
and
a
winchester
or
muzzleloader
he
is
very
poor
he
is
very
ignorant
he
has
no
friends
at
court
his
apparatus
is
crude
in
the
extreme
and
his
output
is
miserably
small
this
man
is
usually
a
good
enough
citizen
in
other
ways
of
decent
standing
in
his
own
community
and
a
right
good
fellow
toward
all
the
world
save
revenue
officers
although
a
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
he
is
soundly
convinced
that
the
law
is
unjust
and
that
he
is
only
exercising
his
natural
rights
such
a
man
as
president
frost
has
pointed
out
suffers
none
of
the
moral
degradation
that
comes
from
violating
his
conscience
his
is
whole
in
describing
the
process
of
making
whiskey
in
the
mountain
stills
i
shall
confine
myself
to
the
operations
of
the
little
moonshiner
because
they
illustrate
the
surprising
shiftiness
of
our
backwoodsmen
every
man
in
the
big
woods
is
a
his
skill
in
extemporizing
utensils
and
even
crude
machines
out
of
the
trees
that
grow
around
him
is
of
no
mean
order
as
good
cider
as
ever
i
drank
was
made
in
a
hollowed
log
fitted
with
a
and
operated
by
a
handspike
it
took
but
half
a
day
work
to
make
this
cider
press
and
the
only
tools
used
in
its
construction
were
an
ax
a
mattock
in
lieu
of
adze
an
auger
and
a
jackknife
it
takes
two
or
three
men
to
run
a
still
it
is
possible
for
one
man
to
do
the
work
on
so
small
a
scale
as
is
usually
practiced
but
it
would
be
a
hard
task
for
him
then
too
there
are
few
mountaineers
who
could
individually
furnish
the
capital
small
though
it
be
so
three
men
let
us
say
will
chip
in
five
or
ten
dollars
apiece
and
purchase
a
still
if
such
is
procurable
otherwise
a
new
one
and
that
is
all
the
apparatus
they
have
to
pay
money
for
if
they
should
be
too
poor
even
to
go
to
this
expense
they
will
make
a
retort
by
inverting
a
or
an
old
wooden
churn
over
a
and
then
all
they
have
to
buy
is
a
piece
of
copper
tubing
for
the
worm
illustration
moonshine
still
in
full
operation
in
choosing
a
location
for
their
clandestine
work
the
first
essential
is
running
water
this
can
be
found
in
almost
any
gulch
yet
out
of
a
hundred
known
only
one
or
two
may
be
suitable
for
the
business
most
of
them
being
too
public
in
a
country
where
cattle
and
hogs
run
wild
and
where
a
good
part
of
every
farmer
time
is
taken
in
keeping
track
of
his
stock
there
is
no
place
so
secret
but
that
it
is
liable
to
be
visited
at
any
time
even
though
it
be
in
the
depths
of
the
great
forest
several
miles
from
any
human
habitation
moreover
cattle
and
especially
hogs
are
passionately
fond
of
and
can
scent
it
a
great
distance
so
that
no
still
can
long
remain
unknown
to
them
consequently
the
still
must
be
placed
several
miles
away
from
the
residence
of
anyone
who
might
be
liable
to
turn
informer
although
nearly
all
the
mountain
people
are
indulgent
in
the
matter
of
blockading
yet
personal
rivalries
and
family
jealousies
are
rife
among
them
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
them
to
inform
against
their
enemies
in
the
neighborhood
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
set
up
a
still
near
a
common
trail
at
least
in
the
settlements
our
mountaineers
habitually
notice
every
track
they
pass
whether
of
beast
or
man
and
read
the
sign
with
facility
often
one
of
my
companions
would
stop
as
though
shot
and
point
with
his
toe
to
the
fresh
imprint
of
a
human
foot
in
the
dust
or
mud
of
a
public
road
exclaiming
now
i
wonder
who
feller
was
for
he
hai
got
no
he
would
be
hyar
at
this
time
o
day
and
so
he
would
go
on
figuring
by
a
process
of
elimination
that
is
extremely
cunning
until
some
such
conclusion
as
this
was
reached
that
some
stranger
goin
over
to
little
river
across
the
line
in
tennessee
and
he
footin
hit
as
if
the
devil
was
atter
him
i
bet
he
stobbed
somebody
and
is
runnin
from
the
sheriff
nor
is
the
incident
closed
with
that
our
mountaineer
will
inquire
of
neighbors
and
passersby
until
he
gets
a
description
of
the
wayfarer
and
then
he
will
pass
the
word
along
some
little
is
chosen
that
runs
through
a
gully
so
choked
with
laurel
and
briers
and
rhododendron
as
to
be
quite
impassable
save
by
such
worming
and
crawling
as
must
make
a
great
noise
doubtless
a
faint
follows
the
backbone
of
the
ridge
above
it
and
this
is
the
workers
ordinary
highway
in
going
to
and
fro
but
the
descent
from
ridge
to
gully
is
seldom
made
twice
over
the
same
course
lest
a
trail
be
printed
direct
to
the
this
house

sometimes
inclosed
with
logs
but
oftener
it
is
no
more
than
a
shed
built
low
so
as
to
be
well
screened
by
the
undergrowth
a
great
hemlock
tree
may
be
felled
in
such
position
as
to
help
the

so
long
as
its
top
stays
green
which
will
be
about
a
year
back
far
enough
from
the
to
remain
in
dark
shadow
when
the
furnace
is
going
there
is
built
a
sort
of
nest
for
the
workmen
barely
high
enough
to
sit
up
in
roofed
with
bark
and
thatched
all
over
with
browse
here
many
a
dismal
hour
of
night
is
passed
when
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
on
the
cooking
now
and
then
a
man
crawls
on
all
fours
to
the
furnace
and
pitches
in
a
few
billets
of
wood
keeping
low
at
the
time
so
as
to
offer
as
small
a
target
as
possible
in
the
flare
of
the
fire
such
precaution
is
especially
needed
when
the
number
of
confederates
is
too
small
for
efficient
picketing
around
the
little
plot
where
the
and
lair
are
hidden
laurel
may
be
cut
in
such
way
as
to
make
a
sharp
stubs
being
entangled
with
branches
so
that
a
quick
charge
through
them
would
be
out
of
the
question
two
or
three
days
work
at
most
will
build
the
and
equip
it
ready
for
business
without
so
much
as
a
shingle
being
brought
from
outside
after
the
blockaders
have
established
their
still
the
next
thing
is
to
make
arrangements
with
some
miller
who
will
jeopardize
himself
by
grinding
the
sprouted
corn
for
be
it
known
that
corn
which
has
been
forced
to
sprout
is
a
prime
essential
in
the
making
of
moonshine
whiskey
and
that
the
unlicensed
grinding
of
such
corn
is
an
offense
against
the
law
of
the
united
states
no
less
than
its
distillation
now
to
any
one
living
in
a
country
where
there
is
perhaps
only
one
mill
to
every
hundred
farms
and
it
is
visited
daily
by
men
from
all
over
the
township
the
finding
of
an
accessory
in
the
person
of
a
miller
would
seem
a
most
hopeless
project
but
when
you
travel
in
our
southern
mountains
one
of
the
first
things
that
will
strike
you
is
that
about
every
fourth
or
fifth
farmer
has
a
tiny
of
his
own
tiny
is
indeed
the
word
for
there
are
few
of
these
mills
that
can
grind
more
than
a
bushel
or
two
of
corn
in
a
day
some
have
a
capacity
of
only
half
a
bushel
in
ten
hours
of
steady
grinding
red
grains
of
corn
being
harder
than
white
ones
it
is
a
humorous
saying
in
the
mountains
that
a
red
grain
in
the
gryste
grist
will
stop
the
mill
the
appurtenances
of
such
a
mill
even
to
the
very
themselves
are
fashioned
on
the
spot
how
primitive
such
a
may
be
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
neighbor
of
mine
recently
offered
a
new
mill
complete
for
sale
at
six
dollars
a
few
nails
and
a
iron
rynd
and
spindle
were
the
only
things
in
it
that
he
had
not
made
himself
from
the
raw
materials
in
making
spirits
from
corn
the
first
step
is
to
convert
the
starch
of
the
grain
into
sugar
regular
distillers
do
this
in
a
few
hours
by
using
malt
but
at
the
little
blockade
still
a
slower
process
is
used
for
malt
is
hard
to
get
the
unground
corn
is
placed
in
a
vessel
that
has
a
small
hole
in
the
bottom
warm
water
is
poured
over
the
corn
and
a
hot
cloth
is
placed
over
the
top
as
water
percolates
out
through
the
hole
the
vessel
is
replenished
with
more
of
the
warm
fluid
this
is
continued
for
two
or
three
days
and
nights
until
the
corn
has
put
forth
sprouts
a
couple
of
inches
long
the
diastase
in
the
germinating
seeds
has
the
same
chemical
effect
as
malt
the
starch
is
changed
to
sugar
the
sprouted
corn
is
then
dried
and
ground
into
meal
this
sweet
meal
is
then
made
into
a
mush
with
boiling
water
and
is
let
stand
two
or
three
days
the
sweet
mash
thus
made
is
then
broken
up
and
a
little
rye
malt
similarly
prepared
in
the
meantime
is
added
to
it
if
rye
is
procurable
fermentation
begins
at
once
in
large
distilleries
yeast
is
added
to
hasten
fermentation
and
the
mash
can
then
be
used
in
three
or
four
days
the
blockader
however
having
no
yeast
must
let
his
mash
stand
for
eight
or
ten
days
keeping
it
all
that
time
at
a
proper
temperature
for
fermentation
this
requires
not
only
constant
attention
but
some
skill
as
well
for
there
is
no
thermometer
nor
saccharometer
in
our
mountain
when
done
the
sugar
of
what
is
now
sour
mash
has
been
converted
into
carbonic
acid
and
alcohol
the
resulting
liquid
is
technically
called
the
wash
but
blockaders
call
it
beer
it
is
intoxicating
of
course
but
sour
enough
to
make
a
pig
squeal
this
beer
is
then
placed
in
the
still
a
vessel
with
a
closed
head
connected
with
a
spiral
tube
the
worm
the
latter
is
surrounded
by
a
closed
jacket
through
which
cold
water
is
constantly
passing
a
wood
fire
is
built
in
the
rude
furnace
under
the
still
the
spirit
rises
in
vapor
along
with
more
or
less
steam
these
vapors
are
condensed
in
the
cold
worm
and
trickle
down
into
the
receiver
the
product
of
this
first
distillation
the
low
wines
of
the
trade
the
singlings
of
the
blockader
is
a
weak
and
impure
liquid
which
must
be
redistilled
at
a
lower
temperature
to
rid
it
of
water
and
rank
oils
in
moonshiners
parlance
the
liquor
of
second
distillation
is
called
the
doublings
it
is
in
watching
and
testing
the
doublings
that
an
accomplished
blockader
shows
his
skill
for
if
distillation
be
not
carried
far
enough
the
resulting
spirits
will
be
rank
though
weak
and
if
carried
too
far
nothing
but
pure
alcohol
will
result
regular
distillers
are
assisted
at
this
stage
by
scientific
instruments
by
which
the
proof
is
tested
but
the
maker
of
mountain
dew
has
no
other
instrument
than
a
small
vial
and
his
testing
is
done
entirely
by
the
bead
of
the
liquor
the
little
iridescent
bubbles
that
rise
when
the
vial
is
tilted
when
a
mountain
man
is
shown
any
brand
of
whiskey
whether
a
regular
distillery
product
or
not
he
invariably
tilts
the
bottle
and
levels
it
again
before
tasting
if
the
bead
rises
and
is
persistent
well
and
good
if
not
he
is
prepared
to
condemn
the
liquor
at
once
it
is
possible
to
make
an
inferior
whiskey
at
one
distillation
by
running
the
singlings
through
a
commonly
known
as
a
the
advantage
claimed
is
that
hit
allows
you
to
make
your
whiskey
afore
the
revenue
gits
it
that
all
the
final
process
is
to
run
the
liquor
through
a
rude
charcoal
filter
to
rid
it
of
most
of
its
fusel
oil
this
having
been
done
we
have
moonshine
whiskey
uncolored
limpid
as
water
and
ready
for
i
fancy
that
some
gentlemen
will
stare
at
the
words
here
italicised
but
i
am
stating
facts
it
is
quite
impracticable
for
a
blockader
to
age
his
whiskey
in
the
first
place
he
is
too
poor
to
wait
in
the
second
place
his
product
is
very
small
and
the
local
demand
is
urgent
in
the
third
place
he
has
enough
trouble
to
conceal
or
run
away
with
a
mere
copper
still
to
say
nothing
of
barrels
of
stored
whiskey
cheerfully
he
might
waive
the
quantum
o
the
sin
but
he
is
quite
alive
to
the
hazard
concealin
so
while
the
stuff
is
yet
warm
from
the
still
it
is
taken
by
confederates
and
quickly
disposed
of
there
is
no
exaggeration
in
the
answer
a
moonshiner
once
made
to
me
when
i
asked
him
how
old
the
best
blockade
liquor
ever
got
to
be
if
it
git
to
be
a
month
old
it
fool
me
illustration

by

they
tell
a
story
on
a
whilom
neighbor
of
mine
the
redoubtable
quill
rose
which
to
those
who
know
him
sounds
like
one
of
his
own
a
dude
from
knoxville
said
quill
told
me
once
that
all
good
was
aged
and
that
if
i
age
my
blockade
it
would
bring
a
fancy
price
well
sir
i
tried
it
i
kept
some
for
three
months
and
by
godlings
aint
as
for
purity
all
of
the
moonshine
whiskey
used
to
be
pure
and
much
of
it
still
is
but
every
blockader
knows
how
to
adulterate
and
when
one
of
them
does
stoop
to
such
tricks
he
will
stop
at
no
halfway
measures
some
add
washing
lye
both
to
increase
the
yield
and
to
give
the
liquor
an
artificial
bead
then
prime
this
abominable
fluid
with
pepper
ginger
tobacco
or
anything
else
that
will
make
it
sting
even
buckeyes
which
are
poisonous
themselves
are
sometimes
used
to
give
the
drink
a
soapy
bead
such
decoctions
are
known
in
the
mountains
by
the
expressive
terms
bust
head
bumblings
they
make
a
bumbly
noise
in
a
feller
head
some
of
them
are
so
toxic
that
their
continued
use
might
be
fatal
to
the
drinker

few
drams
may
turn
a
normally
fellow
into
a
raging
fiend
who
will
shoot
or
stab
without
provocation
as
a
rule
the
mountain
people
have
no
compunctions
about
drinking
their
ideas
on
this
as
on
other
matters
of
conduct
being
those
current
everywhere
in
the
eighteenth
century
men

still
at

she
never

that

liquor
about

a
half
gallons
is
all
that
can
be
got
out
of
a
bushel
by
blockaders
methods
even
with
the
aid
of
a
unless
lye
be
added
with
corn
selling
at
cents
to
a
dollar
a
bushel
as
it
did
in
our
settlement
and
taking
into
account
that
the
average
sales
of
a
little
moonshiner
still
probably
did
not
exceed
a
gallon
a
day
and
that
a
bootlegger
must
be
rewarded
liberally
for
marketing
the
stuff
it
will
be
seen
that
there
was
no
fortune
in
this
mysterious
trade
before
prohibition
raised
the
price
let
me
give
you
a
picture
in
a
few
here
in
the
forest
miles
from
any
wagon
road
is
a
little
still
without
so
much
as
a
roof
over
it
hard
by
is
a
little
mill
there
is
not
a
sawed
board
in
that
mill
even
the
hopper
is
made
of
clapboards
riven
on
the
spot
three
or
four
men
haggard
from
sleepless
vigils
strike
out
into
pathless
forest
through
driving
rain
within
five
minutes
the
wet
underbrush
has
drenched
them
to
the
skin
they
climb
climb
climb
there
is
no
trail
for
a
long
way
then
they
reach
a
faint
one
that
winds
winds
climbs
climbs
hour
after
hour
the
men
climb
then
they
begin
to
descend
they
have
crossed
the
divide
a
mile
above
and
are
in
another
state
hour
after
hour
they
climb
down
as
they
would
say
they
visit
farmers
homes
at
dead
of
night
each
man
shoulders
two
bushels
of
shelled
corn
and
starts
back
again
over
the
highest
mountain
range
in
eastern
america
it
is
twenty
miles
to
the
little
mill
they
carry
the
corn
thither
on
their
own
backs
they
sprout
it
grind
it
distill
it
two
of
them
then
carry
the
whiskey
twenty
miles
in
the
opposite
direction
and
at
the
risk
of
capture
and
imprisonment
or
of
death
if
they
resist
peddle
it
out
by
dodging
secret
methods
this
is
no
fancy
sketch
it
is
literal
truth
it
is
no
story
of
the
olden
time
but
of
our
own
day
do
you
wonder
that
one
of
these
men
should
say
with
a
sigh
should
say
this
blockadin
is
the
hardest
work
a
man
ever
done
and
hit
wearin
on
a
feller
narves
fust
chance
i
git
i
ter
quit
and
it
is
a
fact
that
nine
out
of
ten
of
those
who
try
the
moonshining
game
do
quit
before
long
of
their
own
accord
one
day
there
came
a
ripple
of
excitement
in
our
settlement
a
blockader
had
shot
at
jack
coburn
and
a
posse
had
arrested
the
assassin
so
flew
the
rumor
and
it
proved
to
be
true
coburn
was
a
northern
man
who
years
ago
opened
a
little
store
on
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
bought
timber
land
and
finally
rose
to
affluence
with
ready
wit
he
adapted
himself
to
the
ways
of
the
mountaineers
and
gained
ascendancy
among
them
once
in
a
while
an
emergency
would
arise
in
which
it
was
necessary
either
to
fight
or
to
back
down
and
in
these
contests
a
certain
art
that
jack
had
acquired
in
michigan
lumber
camps
proved
the
undoing
of
more
than
one
mountain
tough
at
the
same
time
winning
the
respect
of
the
spectators
he
was
what
a
mountaineer
described
to
me
as
a
practiced
knocker
this
phrase
far
from
meaning
what
it
would
on
the
bowery
was
interpreted
to
me
as
denoting
a
master
hand
in
a
pugilism
as
distinguished
from
shooting
or
stabbing
was
an
unknown
art
in
the
mountains
until
jack
introduced
it
coburn
had
several
tenants
among
whom
was
a
character
whom
we
will
call
edwards
in
leasing
a
farm
to
edwards
jack
had
expressly
stipulated
that
there
was
to
be
no
moonshining
on
the
premises
but
by
and
by
there
was
reason
to
suspect
that
edwards
was
violating
this
part
of
the
contract
coburn
did
not
send
for
a
revenue
officer
he
merely
set
forth
on
a
little
of
his
own
before
starting
he
picked
up
a
revolver
and
was
about
to
stick
it
in
his
pocket
but
on
second
thought
he
concluded
that
no
man
should
be
trusted
with
a
loaded
gun
even
in
such
a
case
as
this
so
he
thrust
the
weapon
back
into
its
drawer
and
strode
away
with
nothing
but
his
two
big
fists
to
enforce
a
seizure
coburn
searched
long
and
diligently
but
could
find
no
sign
of
a
still
finally
when
he
was
about
to
give
it
up
his
curiosity
was
aroused
by
the
particularly
dense
browse
in
the
top
of
an
enormous
hemlock
that
had
recently
been
felled
pushing
his
way
forward
he
discovered
a
neat
little
copper
still
installed
in
the
treetop
itself
he
picked
up
the
contraband
utensil
and
marched
away
with
it
meantime
edwards
had
not
been
asleep
when
jack
came
in
sight
of
the
farmhouse
humped
under
his
bulky
burden
the
enraged
moonshiner
seized
a
shotgun
and
ran
toward
him
breathing
death
and
destruction
jack
however
trudged
along
about
his
business
edwards
seeing
that
no
bluff
would
work
fired
but
the
range
was
too
great
for
his
birdshot
even
to
pepper
holes
through
the
copper
still
edwards
made
a
mistake
in
firing
that
shot
it
did
not
hurt
skin
but
it
ruffled
his
dignity
in
this
case
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
pommel
the
blackguard
for
he
had
swiftly
reloaded
his
gun
so
jack
ran
off
with
the
still
carried
it
home
sought
out
our
magistrate
brooks
and
forthwith
swore
out
a
warrant
brooks
did
not
fuss
over
any
law
books
moonshining
in
itself
may
be
only
a
peccadillo
a
venial
sin
let
the
government
skin
its
own
skunks
but
when
a
man
has
promised
not
to
moonshine
and
then
goes
and
does
it
why
that
by
jeremy
is
a
breach
of
contract
straightway
the
magistrate
hastened
to
the
and
swore
in
as
a
posse
comitatus
the
first
four
men
that
he
met
now
when
four
men
are
picked
up
at
random
in
our
township
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
at
least
three
of
them
have
been
moonshiners
themselves
and
know
how
this
sort
of
thing
should
be
done
at
any
rate
the
posse
wasted
no
time
in
discussion
they
went
straight
after
that
malefactor
got
him
and
within
an
hour
after
the
shot
was
fired
he
was
drummed
out
of
the
county
for
good
and
forever
but
edwards
had
a
son
who
was
a
trifle
brash
this
son
armed
himself
and
offered
show
of
battle
he
fired
two
or
three
shots
with
his
winchester
wisely
over
the
posse
heads
and
then
took
to
the
tall
timber
dodging
from
tree
to
tree
he
led
the
impromptu
officers
such
a
dance
up
the
mountainside
that
by
the
time
they
had
corralled
him
they
were
plumb
overhet
they
set
that
impetuous
young
man
on
a
little
jackass
strapped
his
feet
under
the
animal
belly
and
their
chief
my
hunting
partner
he
was
drove
him
that
same
night
miles
over
a
horrible
mountain
trail
and
lodged
him
in
the
county
jail
on
a
charge
more
serious
than
that
of
moonshining
in
due
time
a
united
states
deputy
arrived
in
our
midst
bearing
a
hatchet
with
a
pick
at
one
end
which
he
called
a
devil
with
the
pick
end
of
this
instrument
he
punched
numerous
holes
through
the
offending
copper
vessel
until
the
still
looked
somewhat
like
a
gigantic
turned
inside
out
then
he
straightened
out
the
worm
by
ramming
a
long
stick
through
it
and
triumphantly
carried
away
with
him
the
staff
as
legal
proof
trophy
and
burgeon
of
office
the
sorry
old
still
itself
reposes
to
this
day
in
old
brooks
backyard
where
it
is
regarded
by
passersby
as
an
emblem
not
so
much
of
federal
omnipotence
as
of
local
efficiency
in
administering
the
law
with
promptitude
and
without
a
pennyworth
of
cost
to
anybody
save
to
the
offender
chapter
vii
a
leaf
from
the
past
in
the
united
states
moonshining
is
seldom
practiced
outside
the
mountains
and
foothills
of
the
southern
appalachians
and
those
parts
of
the
southwest
namely
in
southern
missouri
arkansas
and
texas
into
which
the
mountaineers
have
immigrated
in
considerable
numbers
here
then
is
a
conundrum
how
does
it
happen
that
moonshining
is
distinctly
a
foible
of
the
southern
mountaineer
to
get
to
the
truth
we
must
hark
back
into
that
eighteenth
century
wherein
as
i
have
already
remarked
our
mountain
people
are
lingering
to
this
day
we
must
leave
the
south
going
first
to
ireland
of
or
years
ago
and
then
to
western
pennsylvania
shortly
after
the
revolution
the
people
of
great
britain
irrespective
of
race
have
always
been
ardent
haters
of
excise
laws
as
blackstone
has
curtly
said
from
its
original
to
the
present
time
the
very
name
of
excise
has
been
odious
to
the
people
of
england
johnson
in
his
dictionary
defined
excise
as
a
hateful
tax
levied
upon
commodities
and
adjudged
not
by
the
common
judges
of
property
but
by
wretches
hired
by
those
to
whom
excise
is
paid
in
when
the
town
of
edinburgh
placed
an
additional
impost
on
ale
the
convenanter
nicoll
proclaimed
it
an
act
so
impious
that
immediately
god
frae
the
heavens
declared
his
anger
by
sending
thunder
and
unheard
tempests
and
storms
and
we
still
recall
burns
fiery
invective
thae
curst
o
the
excise
wha
mak
the
whisky
stills
their
prize
haud
up
thy
han
deil
ance
twice
thrice
there
seize
the
blinkers
wretches
an
bake
them
up
in
brunstane
pies
for
poor
d
n
drinkers
perhaps
the
chief
reason
in
england
for
this
outspoken
detestation
of
the
exciseman
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
law
empowered
him
to
enter
private
houses
and
to
search
at
his
own
discretion
in
scotland
and
ireland
there
was
another
objection
even
more
valid
in
the
eyes
of
the
common
people
excise
struck
heaviest
at
their
national
drink
englishmen
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
were
content
with
their
ale
not
yet
having
contracted
the
habit
of
drinking
gin
but
scotchmen
and
irishmen
preferred
distilled
spirits
manufactured
as
a
rule
out
of
their
own
barley
in
small
means
literally
a
little
pot
the
process
being
a
common
household
art
frequently
practiced
every
man
for
himself
and
his
neighbor
a
tax
then
upon
whiskey
was
as
odious
as
a
tax
upon
bread
baked
on
the
domestic
hearth
if
not
indeed
more
so
now
there
came
a
time
when
the
taxes
laid
upon
spirituous
liquors
had
increased
almost
to
the
point
of
prohibition
this
was
done
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
revenue
as
for
the
sake
of
the
public
health
and
morals
englishmen
had
suddenly
taken
to
drinking
gin
and
the
immediate
effect
was
similar
to
that
of
introducing
firewater
among
a
race
of
savages
there
was
hue
and
cry
apparently
with
good
reason
that
the
gin
habit
spreading
like
a
plague
among
a
people
unused
to
strong
liquors
would
soon
exterminate
the
english
race
parliament
alarmed
at
the
outlook
then
passed
an
excise
law
of
extreme
severity
as
always
happens
in
such
cases
the
law
promptly
defeated
its
own
purpose
by
breeding
a
spirit
of
defiance
and
resistance
among
the
great
body
of
the
people
the
heavier
the
tax
the
more
widespread
became
the
custom
of
illicit
distilling
the
law
was
evaded
in
two
different
ways
the
method
depending
somewhat
upon
the
relative
loyalty
of
the
people
toward
the
crown
and
somewhat
upon
the
character
of
the
country
as
to
whether
it
was
thickly
or
thinly
settled
in
rich
and
populous
districts
as
around
london
and
edinburgh
and
dublin
the
common
practice
was
to
bribe
government
officials
a
historian
of
that
time
declares
that
not
infrequently
the
gauger
could
have
laid
his
hands
upon
a
dozen
stills
within
as
many
hours
but
he
had
cogent
reasons
for
avoiding
discoveries
unless
absolutely
forced
to
make
them
where
informations
were
laid
it
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
a
trusty
messenger
to
be
dispatched
from
the
residence
of
the
gauger
to
give
due
notice
so
that
by
daybreak
next
morning
boys
with
all
their
utensils
might
disappear
now
and
then
they
were
required
to
leave
an
old
and
still
in
place
of
that
which
they
were
to
remove
so
that
a
report
of
actual
seizure
might
be
made
a
good
understanding
was
thus
often
kept
up
between
the
gaugers
and
the
distillers
the
former
not
infrequently
received
a
upon
every
still
within
his
jurisdiction
and
his
cellars
were
never
without
sup
of
the
the
commerce
was
carried
on
to
a
very
great
extent
and
openly
poteen
was
usually
preferred
even
by
the
gentry
to
or
whiskey
it
was
known
to
be
free
from
adulteration
and
had
a
smoky
flavor
arising
from
the
peat
fires
which
many
liked
another
writer
says
that
the
amount
of
spirits
produced
by
distillation
avowedly
illicit
vastly
exceeded
that
produced
by
the
licensed
distilleries
according
to
wakefield
stills
were
erected
even
in
the
kitchens
of
baronets
and
in
the
stables
of
clergymen
however
this
sort
of
thing
was
not
moonshining
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
that
system
of
wholesale
collusion
which
in
later
times
was
perfected
in
our
own
country
by
the
whiskey
ring
moonshining
proper
was
confined
to
the
poorer
class
of
people
especially
in
ireland
who
lived
in
wild
and
sparsely
settled
regions
who
were
governed
by
a
clan
feeling
stronger
than
their
loyalty
to
the
central
government
and
who
either
could
not
afford
to
share
their
profits
with
the
gaugers
or
disdained
to
do
so
such
people
hid
their
little
in
inaccessible
places
as
in
the
savage
mountains
and
glens
of
connemara
where
it
was
impossible
or
at
least
hazardous
for
the
law
to
reach
them
with
arms
in
hand
they
defied
the
officers
the
hatred
of
the
people
toward
the
gauger
was
for
a
very
long
period
intense
the
very
name
invariably
aroused
the
worst
passions
to
kill
a
gauger
was
considered
anything
but
a
crime
wherever
it
could
be
done
with
comparative
safety
he
was
hunted
to
the
death
thus
we
see
that
the
townsman
weapon
against
the
government
was
graft
and
the
mountaineer
weapon
was
his
gun
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
in
ireland
as
they
are
in
america
whether
racial
character
had
much
to
do
with
this
is
a
debatable
question
but
having
spoken
of
race
a
new
factor
and
a
curious
one
steps
into
our
story
let
it
be
noted
closely
for
it
bears
directly
on
a
problem
that
has
puzzled
many
of
our
own
people
namely
what
was
the
origin
of
our
southern
mountaineers
the
north
of
ireland
at
the
time
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
was
not
settled
by
irishmen
but
by
scotchmen
who
had
been
imported
by
james
to
take
the
place
of
native
hibernians
whom
he
had
dispossessed
from
the
three
northern
counties
these
immigrants
came
to
be
known
as
the
they
learned
how
to
make
poteen
in
little
stills
after
the
irish
fashion
and
to
defend
their
stills
from
intrusive
foreigners
also
after
the
irish
fashion
by
and
by
these
fell
out
with
the
british
government
and
large
bodies
of
them
emigrated
to
america
settling
for
the
most
part
in
western
pennsylvania
they
were
a
fighting
race
accustomed
to
plenty
of
hard
knocks
at
home
they
took
to
the
rough
fare
and
indian
wars
of
our
border
as
naturally
as
ducks
take
to
water
they
brought
with
them
too
an
undying
hatred
of
excise
laws
and
a
spirit
of
unhesitating
resistance
to
any
authority
that
sought
to
enforce
such
laws
it
was
these
scotchmen
in
the
main
assisted
by
a
good
sprinkling
of
native
irish
and
by
the
wilder
blades
among
the
who
drove
out
the
indians
from
the
alleghany
border
formed
our
in
the
revolution
won
that
rough
mountain
region
for
civilization
left
it
when
the
game
became
scarce
and
neighbors
houses
too
frequent
followed
the
mountains
southward
settled
western
virginia
and
carolina
and
formed
the
vanguard
westward
into
kentucky
tennessee
missouri
and
so
onward
till
there
was
no
longer
a
west
to
conquer
some
of
their
descendants
remained
behind
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
alleghanies
the
blue
ridge
and
the
unakas
and
became
in
turn
the
progenitors
of
that
singular
race
which
by
an
absurd
pleonasm
is
now
commonly
known
as
the
mountain
whites
but
properly
southern
highlanders
the
first
generation
of
pennsylvania
frontiersmen
knew
no
laws
but
those
of
their
own
making
they
were
too
far
away
too
scattered
and
too
poor
for
the
crown
to
bother
with
them
then
came
the
revolution
the
backwoodsmen
were
loyal
to
the
new
american
government
loyal
to
a
man
they
not
only
fought
off
the
indians
from
the
rear
but
sent
many
of
their
incomparable
riflemen
to
fight
at
the
front
as
well
they
were
the
first
people
to
use
weapons
of
precision
the
rifle
introduced
by
the
about
was
used
by
our
backwoodsmen
exclusively
throughout
the
war
they
were
the
first
to
employ
formation
in
civilized
warfare
they
were
the
first
outside
colonists
to
assist
their
new
england
brethren
at
the
siege
of
boston
they
were
mustered
in
as
the
first
regiment
of
foot
of
the
continental
army
being
the
first
troops
enrolled
by
our
congress
and
the
first
to
serve
under
a
federal
banner
they
carried
the
day
at
saratoga
the
cowpens
and
king
mountain
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
war
they
were
washington
favorite
troops
illustration
a
tub
mill
and
yet
these
same
men
were
the
first
rebels
against
the
authority
of
the
united
states
government
and
it
was
their
old
washington
himself
who
had
the
ungrateful
task
of
bringing
them
to
order
by
a
show
of
federal
bayonets
it
happened
in
this
wise
up
to
the
year
there
had
been
no
excise
tax
in
the
united
colonies
or
the
united
states
one
that
had
been
tried
in
pennsylvania
was
utterly
abortive
then
the
country
fell
upon
hard
times
a
larger
revenue
had
to
be
raised
and
hamilton
suggested
an
excise
the
measure
was
bitterly
opposed
by
many
public
men
notably
by
jefferson
but
it
passed
immediately
there
was
trouble
in
the
tall
timber
western
pennsylvania
and
the
mountains
southward
had
been
settled
as
we
have
seen
by
the
men
who
had
brought
with
them
a
certain
fondness
for
whiskey
a
certain
knack
in
making
it
and
an
intense
hatred
of
excise
on
general
as
well
as
special
principles
there
were
few
roads
across
the
mountains
and
these
few
were
execrable
so
bad
indeed
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
backwoodsmen
to
bring
their
corn
and
rye
to
market
except
in
a
concentrated
form
the
farmers
of
the
seaboard
had
grown
rich
from
the
high
prices
that
prevailed
during
the
french
revolution
but
the
mountain
farmers
had
remained
poor
owing
partly
to
difficulties
of
tillage
but
chiefly
to
difficulties
of
transportation
as
albert
gallatin
said
in
defending
the
western
people
we
have
no
means
of
bringing
the
produce
of
our
lands
to
sale
either
in
grain
or
in
meal
we
are
therefore
distillers
through
necessity
not
choice
that
we
may
comprehend
the
greatest
value
in
the
smallest
size
and
weight
the
inhabitants
of
the
eastern
side
of
the
mountains
can
dispose
of
their
grain
without
the
additional
labor
of
distillation
at
a
higher
price
than
we
can
after
we
have
disposed
that
labor
upon
it
again
as
in
all
frontier
communities
there
was
a
scarcity
of
cash
in
the
mountains
commerce
was
carried
on
by
barter
but
there
had
to
be
some
means
of
raising
enough
cash
to
pay
taxes
and
to
purchase
such
necessities
as
sugar
calico
gun
powder
from
the
peddlers
who
brought
them
by
pack
train
across
the
alleghanies
consequently
a
still
had
been
set
up
on
nearly
every
farm
a
horse
could
carry
about
sixteen
gallons
of
liquor
which
represented
eight
bushels
of
grain
in
weight
and
bulk
and
double
that
amount
in
value
this
whiskey
even
after
it
had
been
transported
across
the
mountains
could
undersell
even
so
cheap
a
beverage
as
new
england
rum
so
long
as
no
tax
was
laid
upon
it
but
when
the
newly
created
congress
passed
an
excise
law
it
virtually
placed
a
heavy
tax
on
the
poor
mountaineers
grain
and
let
the
grain
of
the
wealthy
eastern
farmers
pass
on
to
market
without
a
cent
of
charge
naturally
enough
the
excitable
people
of
the
border
regarded
such
a
law
as
aimed
exclusively
at
themselves
they
remonstrated
petitioned
stormed
from
the
passing
of
the
law
in
january
there
appeared
a
marked
dissatisfaction
in
the
western
parts
of
pennsylvania
maryland
virginia
the
carolinas
and
georgia
the
legislatures
of
north
carolina
virginia
and
maryland
passed
resolutions
against
the
law
and
that
of
pennsylvania
manifested
a
strong
spirit
of
opposition
to
it
as
early
as
washington
was
informed
that
throughout
this
whole
region
the
people
were
ready
for
revolt
to
tax
their
stills
seemed
a
blow
at
the
only
thing
which
obdurate
nature
had
given
them
a
lot
hard
indeed
in
comparison
with
that
of
the
people
of
the
our
western
mountains
we
call
most
of
them
southern
mountains
now
resembled
somewhat
those
wild
highlands
of
connemara
to
which
reference
has
been
made
only
they
were
far
wilder
far
less
populous
and
inhabited
by
a
people
still
prouder
more
independent
more
used
to
being
a
law
unto
themselves
than
were
their
ancestors
in
old
hibernia
when
the
federal
exciseman
came
among
this
border
people
and
sought
to
levy
tribute
they
blackened
or
otherwise
disguised
themselves
and
treated
him
to
a
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
at
the
same
time
threatening
to
burn
his
house
he
resigned
indignation
meetings
were
held
resolutions
were
passed
calling
on
all
good
citizens
to
the
law
and
whenever
anyone
ventured
to
express
a
contrary
opinion
or
rented
a
house
to
a
collector
he
too
was
tarred
and
feathered
if
a
prudent
or
individual
took
out
a
license
and
sought
to
observe
the
law
he
was
visited
by
a
gang
of
whiskey
boys
who
smashed
the
still
and
inflicted
corporal
punishment
upon
its
owner
finally
warrants
were
issued
against
the
lawbreakers
the
attempt
to
serve
these
writs
produced
an
uprising
on
july
a
company
of
mountain
militia
marched
to
the
house
of
the
inspector
general
neville
to
force
him
to
give
up
his
commission
neville
fired
upon
them
and
in
the
skirmish
that
ensued
five
of
the
attacking
force
were
wounded
and
one
was
killed
the
next
day
a
regiment
of
mountaineers
led
by
one
tom
the
tinker
burned
neville
house
and
forced
him
to
flee
for
his
life
his
guard
of
eleven
soldiers
surrendered
after
losing
one
killed
and
several
wounded
a
call
was
then
issued
for
a
meeting
of
the
mountain
militia
at
the
historic
braddock
field
on
a
large
body
assembled
of
whom
were
armed
they
marched
on
pittsburgh
then
a
village
of
souls
the
townsmen
eager
to
conciliate
and
to
ward
off
pillage
appointed
a
committee
to
meet
the
mob
half
way
the
committee
finding
that
it
could
not
induce
the
mountain
men
to
go
home
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
by
escorting
of
them
into
pittsburgh
town
as
fisher
says
the
town
was
warned
by
messengers
and
every
preparation
was
made
not
for
defense
but
to
extinguish
the
fire
of
the
whiskey
thirst
which
would
prevent
the
necessity
of
having
to
extinguish
the
fire
they
might
apply
to
houses
then
the
work
began
every
citizen
worked
like
a
slave
to
carry
provisions
and
buckets
of
whiskey
to
that
camp
judge
brackenridge
tells
us
that
it
was
an
expensive
as
well
as
laborious
day
and
cost
him
personally
four
barrels
of
prime
old
whiskey
the
day
ended
in
a
bloodless
but
probably
uproarious
jollification
on
this
same
day
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
having
declined
to
interfere
washington
issued
a
proclamation
against
the
rioters
and
called
for
militia
to
quell
the
insurrection
meantime
he
had
appointed
commissioners
to
go
into
the
disaffected
region
and
try
to
persuade
the
people
to
submit
peacefully
before
the
troops
should
arrive
peace
was
offered
on
condition
that
the
leaders
of
the
disturbance
should
submit
to
arrest
while
negotiations
were
proceeding
the
army
advanced
eighteen
ringleaders
of
the
mob
were
arrested
and
the
insurrection
faded
away
like
smoke
when
the
troops
arrived
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
the
insurgent
leaders
were
tried
for
treason
and
two
of
them
were
convicted
but
washington
pardoned
both
of
them
the
cost
of
this
expedition
was
more
than
of
the
total
expenditures
of
the
government
for
that
year
for
all
other
purposes
the
moral
effect
upon
the
nation
at
large
was
wholesome
for
the
federal
government
had
demonstrated
on
this
its
first
test
that
it
could
enforce
its
own
laws
and
maintain
domestic
tranquility
the
result
upon
the
mountain
people
themselves
was
dubious
thomas
jefferson
wrote
to
madison
in
december
the
information
of
our
virginia
militia
returned
from
the
westward
is
uniform
that
though
the
people
there
let
them
pass
quietly
they
were
objects
of
their
laughter
not
of
their
fear
that
one
thousand
men
could
have
cut
off
their
whole
force
in
a
thousand
places
of
the
alleghany
that
their
detestation
of
the
excise
law
was
universal
and
has
now
associated
with
it
a
detestation
of
the
government
and
that
a
separation
which
was
perhaps
a
very
distant
and
problematical
event
is
now
near
and
certain
and
determined
in
the
mind
of
every
man
but
jefferson
himself
came
to
the
presidency
within
six
years
and
the
excise
tax
was
promptly
repealed
never
again
to
be
instituted
save
as
a
war
measure
until
within
a
time
so
recent
that
it
is
now
remembered
by
men
whom
we
would
not
call
very
old
the
moonshiners
of
our
own
day
know
nothing
of
the
story
that
has
here
been
written
only
once
within
my
knowledge
has
it
been
told
in
the
mountains
and
then
the
result
was
so
unexpected
that
i
append
the
incident
as
a
color
contrast
to
this
rather
sombre
i
was
calling
on
a
patriarch
who
was
a
trifle
vain
of
his
historical
learning
he
could
not
read
but
one
of
his
daughters
read
to
him
and
he
had
learned
by
heart
nearly
all
that
lay
between
the
two
lids
of
a
universal
history
such
as
book
agents
peddle
about
like
one
of
john
fox
characters
he
was
fond
of
the
expression
says
and
he
considered
it
a
clincher
in
all
matters
of
debate
our
conversation
drifted
to
the
topic
of
moonshining
down
to
the
time
of
the
civil
war
declared
the
old
settler
nobody
paid
tax
on
the
whiskey
he
made
hit
was
thataway
in
my
pa
time
and
in
too
and
so
back
to
the
time
of
george
washington
now
says
that
washington
was
the
father
of
his
country
and
i
reckon
he
was
the
man
that
ever
lived
do
you
i
murmured
a
complaisant
assent
waal
sir
if
was
right
to
make
free
whiskey
in
washington
day
hit
right
and
the
old
man
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
but
that
is
where
you
make
a
mistake
i
replied
washington
did
enforce
a
whiskey
tax
then
i
told
about
the
whiskey
insurrection
of
this
was
news
to
grandpa
he
listened
with
deep
attention
his
brows
lowering
as
the
narrative
proceeded
when
it
was
finished
he
offered
no
comment
but
brooded
to
himself
in
silence
my
own
thoughts
wandered
far
afield
until
recalled
to
the
topic
by
a
blunt
demand
illustration
cabin
on
the
little
fork
of
sugar
fork
of
hazel
creek
in
which
the
author
lived
alone
for
three
years
you
say
washington
done
that
he
did
george
washington
yes
sir
the
father
of
his
country
waal
i
satisfied
now
that
washington
was
a
cracked
the
law
of
although
it
imposed
a
tax
on
whiskey
of
only
to
cents
per
proof
gallon
came
near
bringing
on
a
civil
war
which
was
only
averted
by
the
leniency
of
the
federal
government
in
granting
wholesale
amnesty
the
most
stubborn
malcontents
in
the
mountains
moved
southward
along
the
alleghanies
into
western
virginia
and
the
carolinas
where
no
serious
attempt
was
made
to
collect
the
excise
so
they
could
practice
moonshining
to
their
heart
content
and
there
their
descendants
remain
on
the
accession
of
jefferson
in
the
tax
on
spirits
was
repealed
the
war
of
compelled
the
government
to
tax
whiskey
again
but
as
this
was
a
war
tax
shared
by
commodities
generally
it
aroused
no
opposition
in
the
excise
was
again
repealed
and
from
that
time
until
no
specific
tax
was
levied
on
liquors
during
this
period
of
years
the
average
market
price
of
whiskey
was
cents
a
gallon
sometimes
dropping
as
low
as
cents
spirits
were
so
cheap
that
a
burning
fluid
consisting
of
one
part
spirits
of
turpentine
to
four
or
five
parts
alcohol
was
used
in
the
lamps
of
nearly
every
household
moonshining
of
course
had
ceased
to
exist
then
came
the
civil
war
in
a
tax
of
cents
a
gallon
was
levied
early
in
it
rose
to
cents
this
cut
off
the
industrial
use
of
spirits
but
did
not
affect
its
use
as
a
beverage
in
the
latter
part
of
the
tax
leaped
to
a
gallon
and
the
next
year
it
reached
the
prohibitive
figure
of
the
result
of
such
excessive
taxation
was
just
what
it
had
been
in
the
old
times
in
great
britain
in
and
around
the
centers
of
population
there
was
wholesale
fraud
and
collusion
efforts
made
to
repress
and
punish
frauds
were
of
absolutely
no
account
whatever
the
current
price
at
which
distilled
spirits
were
sold
in
the
markets
was
everywhere
recognized
and
commented
on
by
the
press
as
less
than
the
amount
of
the
tax
allowing
nothing
whatever
for
the
cost
of
manufacture
seeing
that
the
outcome
was
disastrous
from
a
fiscal
point
of
view
the
revenue
from
this
source
was
falling
to
the
vanishing
point
congress
in
cut
down
the
tax
to
cents
a
gallon
illicit
distillation
practically
ceased
the
very
hour
that
the
new
law
came
into
operation
the
government
collected
during
the
second
year
of
the
continuance
of
the
act
for
every
one
that
was
obtained
during
the
last
year
of
the
rate
in
there
came
a
new
administration
with
frequent
removals
of
revenue
officials
for
political
purposes
the
revenue
fell
off
in
the
rate
was
raised
to
cents
and
in
to
cents
the
result
is
thus
summarized
by
david
a
wells
investigation
carefully
conducted
showed
that
on
the
average
the
product
of
illicit
distillation
costs
through
deficient
yields
the
necessary
bribery
of
attendants
and
the
expenses
of
secret
and
unusual
methods
of
transportation
from
two
to
three
times
as
much
as
the
product
of
legitimate
and
legal
distillation
so
that
calling
the
average
cost
of
spirits
in
the
united
states
cents
per
gallon
the
product
of
the
illicit
distiller
would
cost
to
cents
leaving
but
cents
per
gallon
as
the
maximum
profit
to
be
realized
from
fraud
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
an
amount
not
sufficient
to
offset
the
possibility
of
severe
penalties
of
fine
imprisonment
and
confiscation
of
property
the
rate
of
cents
constituted
a
moderate
temptation
to
fraud
its
increase
to
cents
constituted
a
temptation
altogether
too
great
for
human
nature
as
employed
in
manufacturing
and
selling
whiskey
to
resist
during
highwines
sold
openly
in
the
chicago
and
cincinnati
markets
at
prices
less
than
the
average
cost
of
production
plus
the
government
tax
investigations
showed
that
the
persons
mainly
concerned
in
the
work
of
fraud
were
the
government
officials
rather
than
the
distillers
and
that
a
ring
extended
to
washington
and
embraced
within
its
sphere
of
influence
and
participation
not
merely
local
supervisors
collectors
inspectors
and
storekeepers
of
the
revenue
but
even
officers
of
the
internal
revenue
bureau
and
probably
also
persons
occupying
confidential
relations
with
the
executive
of
the
nation
such
being
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
centers
of
civilization
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
let
us
now
turn
to
the
mountains
and
see
how
matters
stood
among
those
primitive
people
who
were
still
tarrying
in
the
eighteenth
their
situation
at
that
time
is
thus
briefly
sketched
by
a
southern
historian
before
the
war
these
simple
folks
made
their
apples
and
peaches
into
brandy
and
their
corn
into
whiskey
and

the
raising
of

of

in

and
the
getting
out

in

were
almost
their
only
resources
the
burden
of
taxation
rested
lightly
on
them
for
near
two
generations
no
excise
duties
had
been
levied
the
war
came
on
they
were
mostly
loyal
to
the
union
they
paid
the
first
moderate
tax
without
a
murmur
they
were
willing
to
pay
any
tax
that
they
were
able
to
pay
but
suddenly
the
tax
jumped
to
and
then
to
a
gallon
the
people
were
goaded
to
open
rebellion
their
corn
at
that
time
brought
only
from
to
cents
a
bushel
apples
and
peaches
rarely
more
than
cents
at
the
stills
these
were
the
only
crops
that
could
be
grown
in
their
deep
and
narrow
valleys
transportation
was
so
difficult
and
markets
so
remote
that
there
was
no
way
to
utilize
the
surplus
except
to
distill
it
their

were
too
small
to
bear
the
cost
of

the
superior

by

by

their

whose
income
depended
upon
the
number
of

they
cut
up

upon
the

made

as

blockaders
and

little
or
no
attention
seems
to
have
been
paid
to
the
moonshining
that
was
going
on
in
the
mountains
until
about
owing
no
doubt
to
the
larger
game
in
registered
distilleries
in
his
report
for
the
new
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
called
attention
to
the
illicit
manufacture
of
whiskey
in
the
mountain
counties
of
the
south
and
urged
vigorous
measures
for
its
immediate
suppression
the
extent
of
these
frauds
said
he
would
startle
belief
i
can
safely
say
that
during
the
past
year
not
less
than
illicit
stills
have
been
operated
in
the
districts
named
those
stills
are
of
a
producing
capacity
of
to
gallons
a
day
they
are
usually
located
at
inaccessible
points
in
the
mountains
away
from
the
ordinary
lines
of
travel
and
are
generally
owned
by
unlettered
men
of
desperate
character
armed
and
ready
to
resist
the
officers
of
the
law
where
occasion
requires
they
come
together
in
companies
of
from
ten
to
fifty
persons
gun
in
hand
to
drive
the
officers
out
of
the
country
they
resist
as
long
as
resistance
is
possible
and
when
their
stills
are
seized
and
they
themselves
are
arrested
they
plead
ignorance
and
poverty
and
at
once
crave
the
pardon
of
the
government
these
frauds
had
become
so
open
and
notorious
that
i
became
satisfied
extraordinary
measures
would
be
required
to
break
them
up
collectors
were
each
authorized
to
employ
from
five
to
ten
additional
deputies
experienced
revenue
agents
of
perseverance
and
courage
were
assigned
to
duty
to
with
the
collectors
united
states
marshals
were
called
upon
to
with
the
collectors
and
to
arrest
all
persons
known
to
have
violated
the
laws
and
were
enjoined
to
prosecute
all
offenders
in
certain
portions
of
the
country
many
citizens
not
guilty
of
violating
the
law
themselves
were
in
strong
sympathy
with
those
who
did
violate
and
the
officers
in
many
instances
found
themselves
unsupported
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
by
a
healthy
state
of
public
opinion
the
distillers
ever
ready
to
forcibly
resist
the
officers
were
i
have
no
doubt
at
times
treated
with
harshness
this
occasioned
much
indignation
on
the
part
of
those
who
sympathized
with
the
lawbreakers
the
commissioner
recommended
in
his
report
the
passage
of
a
law
expressly
providing
that
where
a
person
is
caught
in
the
act
of
operating
an
illicit
still
he
may
be
arrested
without
warrant
in
conclusion
he
said
at
this
time
not
only
is
the
united
states
defrauded
of
its
revenues
and
its
officers
openly
resisted
but
when
arrests
are
made
it
often
occurs
that
prisoners
are
rescued
by
mob
violence
and
officers
and
witnesses
are
often
at
night
dragged
from
their
homes
and
cruelly
beaten
or
waylaid
and
assassinated
one
day
i
asked
a
mountain
man
how
about
the
revenue
officers
what
sort
of
men
are
they
torn
down
scoundrels
every
one
oh
come
now
yes
they
are
plumb
onery
lock
stock
barrel
and
consider
what
they
have
to
go
through
i
remarked
like
other
detectives
they
can
not
secure
evidence
without
practicing
deception
their
occupation
is
hard
and
dangerous
here
in
the
mountains
every
man
hand
is
against
them
why
is
it
agin
them
we
ai
all
blockaders
yet
you
can
search
these
mountains
through
with
a
comb
and
you
wunt
find
ary
critter
as
has
a
good
word
to
say
for
the
revenue
the
reason
is
we
know
them
men
from
back
we
know
whut
they
uster
do
afore
they
jined
the
sarvice
and
why
they
did
it
most
of
them
were
blockaders
their
own
selves
till
they
saw
how
they
could
make
more
money
turncoatin
they
use
their
authority
to
abuse
people
who
ai
never
done
nothin
nohow
dangerous
business
shucks
there
jim
cody
for
a
sample
i
suppress
the
real
name
he
was
principally
raised
in
this
county
and
knowed
him
from
a
boy
he
been
eight
years
in
the
government
sarvice
and
hai
never
been
shot
at
once
but
he
killed
a
blockader
oh
yes
he
arrested
tom
hayward
a
chunk
of
a
boy
that
was
scared
most
fitified
and
never
resisted
a
mouse
cody
who
was
half
drunk
handcuffed
tom
quarreled
with
him
and
shot
the
boy
dead
while
the
handcuffs
was
on
him
tom
relations
sued
cody
in
the
county
court
but
he
carried
the
case
to
the
federal
court
and
they
were
too
poor
to
follow
it
up
i
tell
you
though
thar
a
settlement
less
a
thousand
mile
from
the
river
whar
jim
cody
ai
never
showed
his
nose
sence
he
knows
there
be
another
revenue
it
must
be
ticklish
business
for
an
officer
to
prowl
about
the
headwaters
of
these
mountain
streams
looking
for
hell
banjer
they
do
go
prodjectin
around
looking
for
stills
they
set
at
home
on
their
hunkers
till
some
feller
comes
and
informs
what
class
of
people
does
the
informing
oh
sometimes
hit
some
pizen
old
bum
who
been
refused
credit
sometimes
hit
the
wife
or
mother
of
some
feller
who
drinkin
too
much
then
agin
hit
may
be
some
rival
blockader
who
aims
to
cut
off
the
other
feller
trade
and
same
time
divert
suspicion
from
his
own
self
but
ginerally
hit
jest
somebody
who
has
a
gredge
agin
the
blockader
fer
family
reasons
or
business
reasons
and
turns
informer
to
git
even
it
is
only
fair
to
present
this
side
of
the
case
because
there
is
much
truth
in
it
and
because
it
goes
far
to
explain
the
bitter
feeling
against
revenue
agents
personally
that
is
almost
universal
in
the
mountains
and
is
shared
even
by
the
mountain
preachers
it
should
be
understood
too
in
this
connection
that
the
southern
highlander
has
a
long
memory
slights
and
injuries
suffered
by
one
generation
have
their
scars
transmitted
to
sons
and
grandsons
there
is
no
denying
that
there
have
been
officers
in
the
revenue
service
who
stung
by
the
contempt
in
which
they
were
held
as
renegades
from
their
own
people
have
used
their
authority
in
settling
private
scores
and
have
inflicted
grievous
wrongs
upon
innocent
people
this
is
matter
of
official
record
in
his
report
for
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
himself
declared
that
instances
have
been
brought
to
my
attention
where
numerous
prosecutions
have
been
instituted
for
the
most
trivial
violations
of
law
and
the
arrested
parties
taken
long
distances
and
subjected
to
great
inconveniences
and
expense
not
in
the
interest
of
the
government
but
apparently
for
no
other
reason
than
to
make
costs
an
states
commissioner
told
me
that
in
the
darkest
days
of
this
struggle
when
he
himself
was
obliged
to
buckle
on
a
revolver
every
time
he
put
his
head
out
of
doors
he
had
more
trouble
with
his
own
deputies
than
with
the
moonshiners
as
a
rule
none
but
desperadoes
could
be
hired
for
the
service
he
declared
for
example
one
time
my
deputy
in
your
county
wanted
some
liquor
for
himself
he
and
two
of
his
cronies
crossed
the
line
into
south
carolina
raided
a
still
and
got
beastly
drunk
the
blockaders
bushwhacked
them
riddled
a
mule
and
its
rider
with
buckshot
and
shot
my
deputy
through
the
brain
with
a
squirrel
rifle
we
went
over
there
and
buried
the
victims
a
few
days
later
during
a
snow
storm
working
with
our
holster
flaps
unbuttoned
i
had
all
that
work
and
worry
simply
because
that
rascal
was
bent
on
getting
drunk
without
paying
for
it
however
it
cost
him
his
life
they
were
not
all
like
that
though
continued
the
judge
now
and
then
there
would
turn
up
in
the
service
a
man
who
had
entered
it
from
honorable
motives
and
whose
conduct
at
all
times
was
chivalric
and
clean
there
was
hersh
harkins
for
example
now
united
states
collector
at
asheville
i
had
many
cases
in
which
harkins
figured
tell
me
of
one
i
urged
well
one
time
there
was
a
man
named
jenks
that
was
not
the
real
name
but
it
will
serve
who
was
too
rich
to
be
suspected
of
blockading
jenks
had
a
license
to
make
brandy
but
not
whiskey
one
day
harkins
was
visiting
his
and
he
noticed
something
dubious
thrusting
his
arm
down
through
the
peach
pomace
he
found
mash
underneath
it
is
a
penitentiary
offense
to
mix
the
two
harkins
procured
more
evidence
from
jenk
distiller
and
hauled
the
offender
before
me
the
trial
was
conducted
in
a
hotel
room
full
of
people
we
were
not
very
formal
in
those
days
kept
our
hats
on
there
was
no
thought
of
jenks
trying
to
run
away
for
he
was
so
he
was
given
the
freedom
of
the
room
he
paced
nervously
back
and
forth
between
my
desk
and
the
door
growing
more
restless
as
the
trial
proceeded
a
clerk
sat
near
me
writing
a
bond
and
harkins
stood
behind
him
dictating
its
terms
suddenly
jenks
wheeled
around
near
the
door
jerked
out
a
navy
revolver
fired
and
bolted
it
is
hard
to
say
whom
he
shot
at
for
the
bullet
went
through
harkins
coat
through
the
clerk
hat
and
through
my
hat
too
i
ducked
under
the
desk
to
get
my
revolver
and
harkins
thinking
that
i
was
killed
sprang
to
pick
me
up
but
i
came
up
firing
it
was
wonderful
how
soon
that
room
was
emptied
harkins
took
after
the
fugitive
and
had
a
wild
chase
but
he
got
him
it
was
my
good
fortune
a
few
evenings
later
to
have
a
long
talk
with
harkins
himself
he
was
a
fine
giant
of
a
man
standing
six
feet
three
and
symmetrically
proportioned
no
one
looking
into
his
kindly
gray
eyes
would
suspect
that
they
belonged
to
one
who
had
seen
as
hard
and
dangerous
service
in
the
revenue
department
as
any
man
then
living
in
an
easy
unassuming
way
he
told
me
many
stories
of
his
own
adventures
among
moonshiners
and
counterfeiters
in
the
old
days
when
these
southern
appalachians
fairly
swarmed
with
desperate
characters
one
grim
affair
will
suffice
to
give
an
impression
of
the
man
and
of
the
times
in
which
his
spurs
were
won
there
was
a
man
on
south
mountain
south
carolina
whom
for
the
sake
of
relatives
who
may
still
be
living
we
will
call
lafonte
there
was
information
that
lafonte
was
running
a
blind
tiger
he
got
his
whiskey
from
four
brothers
who
were
blockading
near
his
father
house
just
within
the
north
carolina
line
the
government
had
sent
an
officer
named
merrill
to
capture
lafonte
but
the
latter
drove
merrill
away
with
a
shotgun
harkins
then
received
orders
to
make
the
arrest
taking
merrill
with
him
as
guide
harkins
rode
to
the
father
house
and
found
lafonte
himself
working
near
a
high
fence
as
soon
as
the
criminal
saw
the
officers
approaching
he
ran
for
the
house
to
get
his
gun
harkins
galloped
along
the
other
side
of
the
fence
and
after
a
fight
captured
his
man
the
officers
then
carried
their
prisoner
to
the
house
of
a
man
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
call
him
white
who
lived
about
two
miles
away
meantime
they
had
heard
lafonte
sister
give
three
piercing
screams
as
a
signal
to
his
confederates
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
knew
that
trouble
would
quickly
brew
breakfast
was
ready
in
white
home
when
the
mob
arrived
harkins
sent
merrill
in
to
breakfast
and
himself
went
out
on
the
porch
carbine
in
hand
to
stand
off
the
thoroughly
angry
gang
white
also
went
out
beseeching
the
mob
to
disperse
matters
looked
squally
for
a
time
but
it
was
finally
agreed
that
lafonte
should
give
bond
whereupon
he
was
promptly
released
the
two
officers
then
finished
their
breakfast
and
shortly
set
out
for
the
blue
house
an
abandoned
schoolhouse
about
forty
miles
distant
where
the
trial
was
to
be
conducted
they
were
followed
at
a
distance
by
lafonte
champions
who
were
by
no
means
placated
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
blue
house
was
in
a
neighborhood
friendly
to
the
government
harkins
and
merrill
soon
dodged
to
one
side
in
the
forest
until
the
rioters
had
passed
them
and
then
proceeded
leisurely
in
the
rear
on
their
way
to
the
blue
house
they
cut
up
four
stills
destroyed
a
furnace
and
made
several
arrests
illustration
a
mountain
home
the
next
day
three
united
states
commissioners
opened
court
in
the
old
schoolhouse
the
room
was
crowded
by
curious
spectators
the
trial
had
not
proceeded
beyond
preliminaries
when
shots
and
shouts
from
the
pursuing
mob
were
heard
in
the
distance
immediately
the
room
was
emptied
of
both
crowd
and
commissioners
who
fled
in
all
directions
leaving
harkins
and
merrill
to
fight
their
battle
alone
there
were
thirteen
men
in
the
moonshiners
mob
they
surrounded
the
house
and
immediately
began
shooting
in
through
the
windows
the
officers
returned
the
fire
but
a
ceiling
in
the
room
caused
the
bullets
of
the
attacking
party
to
ricochet
in
all
directions
and
made
the
place
untenable
harkins
and
his
comrade
sprang
out
through
the
windows
but
from
opposite
sides
of
the
house
merrill
ran
but
harkins
grappled
with
the
men
nearest
to
him
and
in
a
moment
the
whole
force
of
desperadoes
was
upon
him
like
a
swarm
of
bees
unfortunately
the
brave
fellow
had
left
his
carbine
at
the
house
where
he
had
spent
the
night
his
only
weapon
was
a
revolver
that
had
only
three
cartridges
in
the
cylinder
each
of
these
shots
dropped
a
man
but
there
were
ten
men
left
nothing
but
harkins
gigantic
strength
saved
him
that
day
from
immediate
death
his
long
arms
tackled
three
or
four
men
at
once
and
all
went
down
in
a
bunch
others
fell
on
top
as
in
a
college
there
had
been
swift
shooting
hitherto
but
now
it
was
mostly
knife
and
it
is
almost
incredible
but
it
is
true
that
this
extraordinary
battle
waged
for
of
an
hour
at
its
end
only
one
man
faced
the
now
thoroughly
exhausted
and
badly
wounded
but
indomitable
officer
at
this
fellow
harkins
hurled
his
pistol
it
struck
him
in
the
forehead
and
the
battle
was
won
a
thick
overcoat
that
harkins
wore
was
pierced
by
bullets
seven
of
which
penetrated
his
body
he
received
besides
three
or
four
bad
in
his
back
and
he
was
literally
dripping
blood
from
head
to
foot
this
tragedy
had
an
almost
comic
sequel
after
all
danger
had
passed
a
sheriff
appeared
on
the
scene
who
placed
not
the
but
the
federal
officer
under
arrest
harkins
left
a
guard
over
the
three
men
whom
he
had
shot
and
submitted
to
arrest
but
demanded
that
he
be
taken
to
the
farmhouse
where
he
had
left
his
horse
this
the
sheriff
actually
refused
to
permit
although
harkins
was
evidently
past
all
possibility
of
continuing
far
afoot
disgusted
at
such
imbecility
the
deputy
stalked
away
from
the
sheriff
leaving
the
latter
with
his
mouth
open
and
utterly
obsessed
a
short
distance
up
the
road
harkins
met
a
countryman
mounted
on
a
sorry
old
mule
loan
me
that
mule
for
half
an
hour
he
requested
you
see
i
can
walk
no
further
but
the
fellow
scared
out
of
his
wits
by
the
spectacle
of
a
man
in
such
desperate
plight
refused
to
accommodate
him
get
down
off
that
mule
or
i
break
your
neck
the
mule
changed
riders
when
the
story
was
finished
i
asked
harkins
if
it
was
true
as
the
reading
public
generally
believes
that
moonshiners
prefer
death
to
capture
do
they
shoot
a
revenue
officer
at
sight
the
answer
was
terse
they
used
to
shoot
nowadays
they
run
we
have
come
to
the
time
when
our
government
began
in
dead
earnest
to
fight
the
moonshiners
and
endeavor
to
suppress
their
traffic
it
was
in
to
give
a
fair
picture
from
the
official
standpoint
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
that
time
i
will
quote
from
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
for
the
year
it
is
with
extreme
regret
he
said
i
find
it
my
duty
to
report
the
great
difficulties
that
have
been
and
still
are
encountered
in
many
of
the
southern
states
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
in
the
mountain
regions
of
west
virginia
virginia
kentucky
tennessee
north
carolina
georgia
and
alabama
and
in
some
portions
of
missouri
arkansas
and
texas
the
illicit
manufacture
of
spirits
has
been
carried
on
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
am
satisfied
that
the
annual
loss
to
the
government
from
this
source
has
been
very
nearly
if
not
quite
equal
to
the
annual
appropriation
for
the
collection
of
the
internal
revenue
tax
throughout
the
whole
country
in
the
regions
of
country
named
there
are
known
to
exist
about
copper
stills
many
of
which
at
certain
times
are
lawfully
used
in
the
production
of
brandy
from
apples
and
peaches
but
i
am
convinced
that
a
large
portion
of
these
stills
have
been
and
are
used
in
the
illicit
manufacture
of
spirits
part
of
the
spirits
thus
produced
has
been
consumed
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
the
balance
has
been
distributed
and
sold
throughout
the
adjacent
districts
this
nefarious
business
has
been
carried
on
as
a
rule
by
a
determined
set
of
men
who
in
their
various
neighborhoods
league
together
for
defense
against
the
officers
of
the
law
and
at
a
given
signal
are
ready
to
come
together
with
arms
in
their
hands
to
drive
the
officers
of
internal
revenue
out
of
the
country
as
illustrating
the
extraordinary
resistance
which
the
officers
have
had
on
some
occasions
to
encounter
i
refer
to
occurrences
in
overton
county
tennessee
in
august
last
where
a
posse
of
eleven
internal
revenue
officers
who
had
stopped
at
a
farmer
house
for
the
night
were
attacked
by
a
band
of
armed
illicit
distillers
who
kept
up
a
constant
fusillade
during
the
whole
night
and
whose
force
was
augmented
during
the
following
day
till
it
numbered
nearly
two
hundred
men
the
officers
took
shelter
in
a
log
house
which
served
them
as
a
fort
returning
the
fire
as
best
they
could
and
were
there
besieged
for
hours
three
of
their
party
being
shot
one
through
the
body
one
through
the
arm
and
one
in
the
face
i
directed
a
strong
force
to
go
to
their
relief
but
in
the
meantime
through
the
intervention
of
citizens
the
besieged
officers
were
permitted
to
retire
taking
their
wounded
with
them
and
without
surrendering
their
arms
so
formidable
has
been
the
resistance
to
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
that
in
the
districts
of
virginia
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
tennessee
west
virginia
arkansas
and
kentucky
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
supply
the
collectors
with
carbines
in
these
districts
and
also
in
the
states
of
georgia
alabama
mississippi
in
the
district
of
north
carolina
and
in
the
and
districts
of
missouri
i
have
authorized
the
organization
of
posses
ranging
from
five
to
sixty
in
number
to
aid
in
making
seizures
and
arrests
the
object
being
to
have
a
force
sufficiently
strong
to
deter
resistance
if
possible
and
if
need
be
to
overcome
it
the
intention
of
the
revenue
department
was
certainly
not
to
inflame
the
mountain
people
but
to
treat
them
as
considerately
as
possible
and
yet
the
policy
of
be
to
their
faults
a
little
blind
had
borne
no
other
fruit
than
to
strengthen
the
combinations
of
moonshiners
and
their
sympathizers
to
such
a
degree
that
they
could
set
the
ordinary
force
of
officers
at
defiance
and
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
men
of
wide
experience
in
the
revenue
service
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
fraud
of
illicit
distilling
was
an
evil
too
firmly
established
to
be
uprooted
and
that
it
must
be
endured
the
real
trouble
was
that
public
sentiment
in
the
mountains
was
almost
unanimously
in
the
moonshiners
favor
leading
citizens
were
either
directly
interested
in
the
traffic
or
were
in
active
sympathy
with
the
distillers
in
some
cases
said
the
commissioner
state
officers
including
judges
on
the
bench
have
sided
with
the
illicit
distillers
and
have
encouraged
the
use
of
the
state
courts
for
the
prosecution
of
the
officers
of
the
united
states
upon
all
sorts
of
charges
with
the
evident
purpose
of
obstructing
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
i
regret
to
have
to
record
the
fact
that
when
the
officers
of
the
united
states
have
been
shot
down
from
ambuscade
in
cold
blood
as
a
rule
no
efforts
have
been
made
on
the
part
of
the
state
officers
to
arrest
the
murderers
but
in
cases
where
the
officers
of
the
united
states
have
been
engaged
in
enforcement
of
the
laws
and
have
unfortunately
come
in
conflict
with
the
violators
of
the
law
and
homicides
have
occurred
active
steps
have
been
at
once
taken
for
the
arrest
of
such
officers
and
nothing
would
be
left
undone
by
the
state
authorities
to
bring
them
to
trial
and
punishment
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
statement
of
the
commissioner
was
a
fair
presentation
of
facts
but
when
he
went
on
to
expose
the
root
of
the
evil
the
underlying
sentiment
that
made
and
still
makes
illicit
distilling
popular
among
our
mountaineers
i
think
that
he
was
singularly
at
fault
this
was
his
explanation
the
only
one
that
i
have
found
in
all
the
reports
of
the
department
from
to
much
of
the
opposition
to
the
enforcement
of
the
internal
revenue
laws
he
does
not
say
but
offers
no
other
theory
is
properly
attributable
to
a
latent
feeling
of
hostility
to
the
government
and
laws
of
the
united
states
still
prevailing
in
the
breasts
of
a
portion
of
the
people
of
these
districts
and
in
consequence
of
this
condition
of
things
the
officers
of
the
united
states
have
often
been
treated
very
much
as
though
they
were
emissaries
from
some
foreign
country
quartered
upon
the
people
for
the
collection
of
tribute
this
shows
an
misunderstanding
of
the
character
of
the
mountain
people
their
history
their
proclivities
and
the
circumstances
of
their
lives
the
southern
mountaineers
as
a
class
have
been
remarkably
loyal
to
the
union
ever
since
it
was
formed
far
more
of
them
fought
for
the
union
than
for
the
confederacy
in
our
civil
war
and
anyway
politics
has
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
moonshining
question
the
reason
for
illicit
distilling
is
purely
an
economic
one
as
i
have
shown
if
officers
of
the
federal
government
have
been
treated
as
foreigners
they
have
met
the
same
reception
that
outsiders
meet
from
the
mountaineers
a
native
of
the
carolina
tidewater
is
a
furriner
in
the
carolina
mountains
and
so
is
a
native
of
the
bluegrass
when
he
enters
the
eastern
hills
of
his
own
state
the
highlander
word
furriner
means
to
him
what
did
to
an
ancient
greek
ordinarily
he
is
courteous
to
the
unfortunate
alien
though
never
deferential
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
regards
the
queer
fellow
with
lofty
superiority
this
trait
is
characteristic
of
all
primitive
peoples
of
all
isolated
peoples
it
is
provincialism
pure
and
simple
a
provincialism
more
crudely
expressed
in
appalachia
than
in
gotham
or
the
hub
but
no
cruder
in
essence
for
all
that
the
vigorous
campaign
of
bore
such
fruit
that
in
the
following
year
the
commissioner
was
able
to
report
we
virtually
have
peaceable
possession
of
the
districts
of
and
north
carolina
georgia
west
tennessee
kentucky
alabama
and
arkansas
in
many
of
which
formidable
resistance
to
the
enforcement
of
the
law
has
prevailed
in
the
western
portion
of
the
virginia
district
in
part
of
west
virginia
in
the
north
carolina
district
in
part
of
south
carolina
and
in
the
and
districts
of
tennessee
i
apprehend
further
serious
difficulties
it
is
very
desirable
in
order
to
prevent
bloodshed
that
the
internal
revenue
forces
sent
into
these
infected
regions
to
make
seizures
and
arrests
shall
be
so
strong
as
to
deter
armed
resistance
in
january
a
combined
movement
by
armed
bodies
of
internal
revenue
officers
was
made
from
west
virginia
southwestward
through
the
mountains
and
foothills
infested
with
illicit
distillers
the
effect
of
this
movement
was
to
convince
violators
of
the
law
that
it
was
the
determination
of
the
government
to
put
an
end
to
frauds
and
resistance
of
authority
and
since
that
time
it
has
been
manifest
to
all
men
in
those
regions
of
the
country
that
the
day
of
the
illicit
distiller
is
past
in
his
report
for
the
commissioner
declared
that
the
supremacy
of
the
laws
has
been
established
in
all
parts
of
the
country
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
number
of
arrests
per
annum
which
hitherto
had
ranged
from
to
now
dropped
off
considerably
and
the
casualties
in
the
service
became
few
and
far
between
but
in
congress
increased
the
tax
on
spirits
from
the
old
cents
figure
to
a
gallon
the
effect
was
almost
instantaneous
we
have
no
means
of
learning
how
many
new
moonshine
stills
were
set
up
but
we
do
know
that
the
number
of
seizures
doubled
and
trebled
and
that
bloodshed
proportionally
increased
again
the
complaint
went
out
that
justice
was
frequently
defeated
even
in
cases
of
conviction
by
failure
to
visit
adequate
punishment
upon
the
offenders
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
our
blockaders
dread
their
own
state
courts
far
more
than
they
do
the
federal
courts
because
the
punishment
for
selling
liquor
in
the
mountain
counties
is
surer
to
follow
conviction
than
is
the
penalty
for
violating
federal
law
the
latter
is
severe
enough
if
it
were
enforced
for
defrauding
or
attempting
to
defraud
the
united
states
of
the
tax
on
spirits
the
law
prescribes
forfeiture
of
the
distillery
and
apparatus
and
of
all
spirits
and
raw
materials
besides
a
fine
of
not
less
than
nor
more
than
imprisonment
for
not
less
than
six
months
nor
longer
than
three
years
i
am
not
able
to
say
what
percentage
of
arrests
is
followed
by
conviction
nor
how
many
convicted
persons
suffer
the
full
penalty
of
the
law
i
only
know
that
public
opinion
in
the
mountains
did
not
consider
an
arrest
or
even
a
conviction
by
the
federal
authorities
as
a
very
serious
matter
during
the
period
from
up
to
the
past
two
or
three
years
and
little
resistance
was
offered
by
blockaders
when
captured
recently
however
a
new
factor
has
entered
the
moonshining
problem
and
profoundly
altered
it
the
south
has
gone
dry
one
might
have
expected
that
prohibition
would
be
bitterly
opposed
in
appalachia
in
view
of
the
fact
that
here
the
principle
still
prevails
in
practice
that
moderate
drinking
is
neither
a
sin
nor
a
disgrace
and
that
a
man
has
the
same
right
to
make
his
own
whiskey
as
his
own
soup
if
he
chooses
undoubtedly
those
who
fight
the
liquor
traffic
on
purely
moral
grounds
are
a
small
minority
in
the
mountains
but
the
blockaders
themselves
are
glad
to
see
prohibitory
laws
enforced
to
the
letter
so
far
as
saloons
and
registered
distilleries
are
concerned
and
the
drinking
public
prefer
their
native
product
from
both
patriotic
and
gustatory
motives
such
a
combination
is
irresistible
when
pure
blockade
of
normal
strength
sold
as
cheaply
as
it
did
before
prohibition
there
was
no
great
profit
in
it
all
risks
and
expenses
considered
but
even
with
interstate
shipments
of
liquors
to
consumers
a
gallon
of
blockade
will
be
watered
to
then
fortified
with
cologne
spirits
or
other
abominations
and
peddled
out
by
bootleggers
at
a
quart
in
villages
and
lumber
camps
where
somebody
always
is
thirsty
and
can
find
the
coin
to
assuage
it
thus
amid
a
class
of
mountaineers
the
temptation
to
run
a
secret
still
and
adulterate
the
output
inflames
and
spreads
in
any
case
the
fact
is
that
blockading
as
a
business
conducted
in
armed
defiance
of
the
law
is
increasing
by
leaps
and
bounds
since
the
mountain
region
went
dry
the
profits
are
much
greater
than
before
because
liquor
is
harder
to
get
in
country
districts
and
consumers
will
pay
higher
prices
without
question
correspondingly
the
risks
are
greater
than
ever
arrests
have
increased
rapidly
and
so
have
mortal
combats
between
officers
and
outlaws
blockading
has
returned
to
much
the
same
status
described
as
previously
quoted
by
our
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
in
i
have
not
seen
recent
revenue
reports
but
i
do
not
need
to
for
the
war
between
officers
and
moonshiners
is
so
close
to
us
that
we
almost
live
within
of
it
if
harkins
were
alive
he
would
say
they
used
to
shoot
and
they
have
taken
it
up
again
observe
please
that
this
is
no
argument
for
or
against
prohibition
that
is
not
my
business
as
a
descriptive
writer
it
is
my
duty
to
collect
facts
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
regardless
of
my
own
or
anyone
else
bias
and
present
them
in
orderly
sequence
it
is
for
the
reader
to
deduce
his
own
conclusions
and
with
them
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
i
have
given
in
brief
the
history
of
illicit
distilling
because
we
must
consider
it
before
we
can
grasp
firmly
the
basic
fact
that
this
is
not
so
much
a
moral
as
an
economic
problem
men
do
not
make
whiskey
in
secret
at
the
peril
of
imprisonment
or
death
because
they
are
outlaws
by
nature
nor
from
any
other
kind
of
depravity
but
simply
and
solely
because
it
looks
like
easy
money
to
poor
folks
if
i
may
voice
my
own
opinion
of
a
working
remedy
it
is
this
give
the
mountaineers
a
lawful
chance
to
make
decent
livings
where
they
are
this
means
first
of
all
decent
roads
whereby
to
market
their
farm
produce
without
losing
all
profit
in
cost
of
transportation
the
first
problem
of
appalachia
is
the
very
same
problem
as
that
of
western
pennsylvania
in
chapter
ix
the
outlander
and
the
native
among
the
many
letters
that
come
to
me
from
men
who
think
of
touring
or
camping
in
highland
dixie
there
are
few
but
ask
how
are
strangers
treated
this
question
natural
and
prudent
though
it
be
never
fails
to
make
me
smile
for
i
know
so
well
the
thoughts
that
lie
back
of
it
suppose
one
should
blunder
innocently
upon
a
moonshine
still
what
would
happen
if
a
feud
were
raging
in
the
land
how
would
a
stranger
fare
if
one
goes
alone
into
the
mountains
does
he
run
any
risk
of
being
robbed
before
i
left
the
tame
west
and
came
into
this
wild
east
i
would
have
asked
a
few
questions
myself
if
i
had
known
anyone
to
answer
them
as
it
was
i
turned
up
rather
abruptly
in
a
backwoods
settlement
where
the
furriner
was
more
than
a
wonder
i
bore
no
credentials
and
it
was
quite
as
well
if
i
had
presented
a
letter
from
some
clergyman
or
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
it
would
have
been
just
what
i
was
myself
a
curiosity
as
when
the
puppy
discovers
some
weird
and
marvelous
new
bug
everyone
greeted
me
politely
but
with
unfeigned
interest
i
was
welcome
to
sup
and
bed
wherever
i
went
moonshiners
and
were
as
affable
as
common
folks
i
dwelt
alone
for
a
long
time
first
in
open
camp
afterwards
in
a
secluded
hut
then
i
boarded
with
a
native
family
often
i
left
my
belongings
to
look
out
for
themselves
whilst
i
went
away
on
expeditions
of
days
or
weeks
at
a
time
and
nobody
ever
stole
from
me
so
much
as
a
or
a
brass
cartridge
so
in
the
retrospect
i
smile
does
this
mean
then
that
poe
characterization
of
the
mountaineers
is
out
of
date
not
at
all
they
are
the
same
fierce
and
uncouth
race
of
men
that
they
were
in
his
time
homicide
is
so
prevalent
in
the
districts
that
i
personally
am
acquainted
with
that
nearly
every
adult
citizen
has
been
directly
interested
in
some
murder
case
either
as
principal
officer
witness
kinsman
or
friend
this
grewsome
subject
i
shall
treat
elsewhere
in
detail
it
is
introduced
here
only
to
emphasize
a
fact
pertinent
to
the
present
topic
namely
that
the
private
wars
of
the
highlanders
are
limited
to
their
own
people
in
our
corner
of
north
carolina
no
traveler
from
the
outside
ever
has
been
a
victim
nor
do
i
know
of
any
such
case
in
the
whole
appalachian
region
illustration
many
of
the
homes
have
but
one
window
and
here
is
another
significant
fact
as
regards
personal
property
i
do
not
know
any
race
in
the
world
that
is
more
honest
than
our
backwoodsmen
of
the
southern
mountains
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
railroad
you
enter
a
land
where
are
rare
and
burglars
almost
unheard
of
in
my
own
county
and
all
those
adjoining
it
there
has
been
only
one
case
of
highway
robbery
and
only
one
of
murder
for
money
so
far
as
i
can
learn
in
the
past
years
the
mountain
code
of
conduct
is
a
curious
mixture
of
savagery
and
civility
one
man
will
kill
another
over
a
pig
or
a
panel
of
fence
not
for
the
property
sake
but
because
of
hot
words
ensuing
and
he
will
come
clear
in
court
because
every
fellow
on
the
jury
feels
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
himself
under
similar
provocation
yet
these
very
men
vengeful
and
cruel
though
they
are
regard
hospitality
as
a
sacred
duty
toward
wayfarers
of
any
degree
and
the
bare
idea
of
stealing
from
a
stranger
would
excite
their
instant
loathing
or
scorn
anyone
of
tact
and
common
sense
can
go
as
he
pleases
through
the
darkest
corner
of
appalachia
without
being
molested
tact
however
implies
the
will
and
the
insight
to
put
yourself
truly
in
the
other
man
place
imagine
yourself
born
bred
circumstanced
like
him
it
implies
also
the
courtesy
of
doing
as
you
would
be
done
by
if
you
were
in
that
fellow
shoes
no
arrogance
no
condescension
but
man
to
man
on
a
footing
of
equal
manliness
and
there
are
manners
in
the
rudest
community
customs
and
rules
of
conduct
that
it
is
well
to
learn
before
one
goes
far
afield
for
example
when
you
stop
at
a
mountain
cabin
if
no
dogs
sound
an
alarm
do
not
walk
up
to
the
door
and
knock
you
are
expected
to
call
out
until
someone
comes
to
inspect
you
none
but
the
most
intimate
neighbors
neglect
this
usage
and
there
is
mighty
good
reason
back
of
it
in
a
land
where
the
path
to
one
door
may
be
a
warpath
if
you
are
armed
as
a
hunter
do
not
fail
to
remove
the
cartridges
from
the
gun
in
your
host
presence
before
you
set
foot
on
his
porch
then
give
him
the
weapon
or
stand
it
in
a
corner
or
hang
it
up
in
plain
view
even
our
sheriff
when
he
stopped
with
us
would
lay
his
revolver
on
the
and
leave
it
there
until
he
went
his
way
if
you
think
a
moment
you
can
see
the
courtesy
of
such
an
act
it
proves
that
the
guest
puts
implicit
trust
in
the
honor
of
his
host
and
in
his
ability
to
protect
all
within
his
house
there
never
has
been
a
case
in
which
such
trust
was
violated
i
knew
a
traveler
who
spending
the
night
in
a
cabin
was
fool
enough
i
can
use
no
milder
term
to
thrust
a
loaded
revolver
under
his
pillow
when
he
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
his
weapon
was
still
there
but
empty
and
its
cartridges
lay
conspicuously
on
a
table
across
the
room
nobody
said
a
word
about
the
incident
the
hint
was
left
to
soak
in
the
only
real
danger
that
one
may
encounter
from
the
native
people
so
long
as
he
behaves
himself
is
when
he
comes
upon
a
man
who
is
wild
with
liquor
and
can
not
sidestep
him
in
such
case
give
him
the
glad
word
and
move
on
at
once
i
have
had
a
drunken
from
the
lumber
camps
fire
five
shots
around
my
head
as
a
and
then
stand
tantalizingly
with
hammer
cocked
over
the
sixth
cartridge
to
see
what
i
would
do
about
it
as
it
chanced
i
did
not
mind
his
fireworks
for
my
head
was
with
the
rising
fever
of
erysipelas
and
i
had
come
dragging
my
heels
many
an
irk
mile
down
from
the
mountains
to
find
a
doctor
so
i
merely
smiled
at
the
fellow
and
asked
if
he
was
having
a
good
time
he
grinned
sheepishly
and
let
me
pass
unharmed
the
chief
drawback
to
travel
in
this
region
aside
from
the
roads
is
not
the
character
of
the
people
but
the
quality
of
bed
and
board
of
course
there
are
good
hotels
at
most
of
the
summer
resorts
but
these
are
few
and
scattering
at
present
for
a
territory
so
immense
in
most
regions
where
there
is
noble
scenery
unspoiled
forest
and
good
fishing
the
accommodations
are
extremely
rude
many
of
the
village
inns
are
dirty
and
their
tables
a
shock
and
a
despair
to
the
hungry
pilgrim
there
are
blessed
exceptions
to
be
sure
but
on
the
other
hand
the
traveler
sometimes
will
encounter
a
cuisine
that
is
neither
edible
nor
speakable
and
will
be
shown
to
a
bed
wherein
it
needs
no
sherlock
holmes
to
detect
that
the
previous
biped
retired
with
his
boots
on
or
at
least
with
much
realty
attached
to
his
person
such
places
often
are
like
that
unpronounceable
town
in
russia
of
which
paragot
said
the
bugs
are
the
most
companionable
creatures
in
it
and
they
are
the
cleanest
if
one
be
of
the
same
mind
as
the
samuel
johnson
that
the
finest
landscape
in
the
world
is
not
worth
a
damn
without
a
cozy
inn
in
the
foreground
he
should
keep
to
the
stock
of
our
highlands
or
seek
other
playgrounds
by
far
the
most
comfortable
way
to
stay
in
the
back
country
at
present
is
in
a
camp
of
one
own
where
he
can
keep
things
tidy
and
have
food
to
suit
him
if
you
be
though
of
stout
stomach
and
wishful
to
get
true
insight
into
mountain
ways
and
character
you
can
find
some
sort
of
almost
anywhere
in
such
case
go
first
to
the
sheriff
of
the
county
in
person
not
by
letter
this
officer
is
a
walking
bureau
of
information
and
dispenses
it
freely
to
any
stranger
he
knows
almost
every
man
in
the
county
his
character
and
his
circumstances
he
may
be
depended
upon
to
direct
you
to
the
best
will
tell
you
how
to
get
hunting
and
fishing
privileges
and
will
recommend
a
good
packer
or
teamster
if
such
help
is
wanted
along
the
railways
and
main
county
roads
the
farmers
show
a
mistrust
about
admitting
company
for
the
night
but
in
the
back
districts
the
generally
is
out
to
all
comers
if
can
stand
what
has
ter
come
right
in
and
set
you
a
cheer
if
the
man
of
the
house
has
misgivings
as
to
the
state
of
the
larder
he
will
say
i
ax
the
woman
gin
she
can
git
ye
a
bite
seldom
does
the
wife
demur
though
sometimes
her
patience
is
sorely
tried
a
stranger
whose
calked
boots
betrayed
his
calling
stopped
at
uncle
mark
to
inquire
can
i
git
to
stay
all
night
aunt
nance
peeping
through
a
crack
warned
her
man
in
a
whisper
them
loggers
jest
louzes
up
folkses
houses
whereat

answered
the
lumberjack
we
ginerally
foller
takin
in
strangers
jack
glanced
significantly
at
the
lowering
clouds
and
grunted
uh
looks
like
i
could
stand
hitched
all
night
this
was
too
much
for
mark
well
he
exclaimed
mebbe
can
find
ye
a
pallet
i
try
to
enjoy
ye
somehow
which
being
interpreted
means
i
entertain
you
as
best
i
can
the
hospitality
of
the
backwoods
knows
no
bounds
short
of
sickness
in
the
family
or
downright
destitution
travelers
often
innocently
impose
on
poor
people
and
even
criticise
the
scanty
fare
when
they
may
be
getting
a
lion
share
of
the
last
loaf
in
the
house
and
few
of
them
realize
the
actual
cost
of
entertaining
company
in
a
home
that
is
long
mountain
miles
from
any
market
fancy
yourself
making
a
round
trip
over
awful
roads
to
carry
back
a
sack
of
flour
on
your
shoulder
and
a
can
of
oil
in
your
hand
then
figure
what
the
transportation
is
worth
once
when
i
was
trying
a
through
the
forest
by
following
vague
directions
i
swerved
to
the
wrong
trail
sunset
found
me
on
the
summit
of
an
unfamiliar
mountain
with
cold
rain
setting
in
and
below
me
lay
the
impenetrable
laurel
of
huggins
hell
i
turned
back
to
the
head
of
the
nearest
water
course
not
knowing
whither
it
led
fought
my
way
through
thicket
and
darkness
to
the
nearest
house
and
asked
for
lodging
the
man
was
just
coming
in
from
work
he
betrayed
some
anxiety
but
admitted
me
with
grave
politeness
then
he
departed
on
an
errand
leaving
his
wife
to
hear
the
story
of
my
wanderings
i
was
eager
for
supper
but
madame
made
no
move
toward
the
kitchen
an
hour
passed
a
little
child
whimpered
with
hunger
the
mother
flushing
soothed
it
on
her
breast
it
was
well
on
in
the
night
when
her
husband
returned
bearing
a
little
poke
of
cornmeal
then
the
woman
flew
to
her
post
soon
we
had
hot
bread
three
or
four
slices
of
pork
and
black
coffee
unsweetened
all
there
was
in
the
house
it
developed
that
when
i
arrived
there
was
barely
enough
meal
for
the
family
supper
and
breakfast
my
host
had
to
shell
some
corn
go
in
almost
pitch
darkness
without
a
lantern
to
a
far
down
the
branch
wait
while
it
ground
out
a
few
spoonfuls
to
the
minute
and
bring
the
meal
back
next
morning
when
i
offered
pay
for
my
entertainment
he
waved
it
aside
i
ai
never
tuk
money
from
company
he
said
and
this
no
time
to
begin
laughing
i
slipped
some
silver
into
the
hand
of
the
eldest
child
this
is
not
pay
it
a
present
the
girl
was
awed
into
speechlessness
at
sight
of
money
of
her
own
and
the
parents
did
not
know
how
to
thank
me
for
her
but
bade
me
stay
on
stranger
pore
folks
has
a
pore
way
but
you
welcome
to
what
we
got
this
incident
is
a
little
out
of
the
common
nowadays
but
it
is
typical
of
what
was
customary
until
lumbering
and
other
industrial
works
began
to
invade
the
solitudes
it
is
the
rule
to
charge
cents
a
meal
and
the
same
for
lodging
regardless
of
what
the
fare
and
the
bed
may
be
when
you
think
of
it
this
is
right
for
the
porer
folks
is
the
harder
it
is
to
things
the
mountaineers
always
are
eager
for
news
in
the
drab
monotony
of
their
lives
the
coming
of
an
unknown
traveler
is
an
event
that
will
set
the
whole
neighborhood
gossiping
every
word
and
action
of
his
will
be
discussed
for
weeks
after
he
has
gone
his
way
this
of
course
is
a
trait
of
rural
people
everywhere
but
imagine
if
you
can
how
it
may
be
intensified
where
there
are
no
newspapers
few
visitors
and
where
the
average
man
gets
maybe
two
or
three
letters
a
year
riding
up
a
branch
road
you
come
upon
a
patriarch
who
halts
you
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
stranger
meanin
no
harm
are
you
gwine
you
tell
him
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
you
had
not
mentioned
it
but
you
do
so
now
what
mought
foller
for
a
living
it
is
wise
to
humor
the
old
man
and
tell
him
frankly
what
is
your
business
up
this
branch
half
a
mile
farther
you
espy
a
girl
coming
toward
you
she
stops
like
a
startled
fawn
with
amazement
then
at
a
bound
she
dodges
into
a
thicket
doubles
on
her
course
and
runs
back
as
fast
as
her
nimble
bare
legs
can
carry
her
to
report
that
comin
at
the
next
house
stopping
for
a
drink
of
water
you
chat
a
few
moments
high
up
the
opposite
hill
is
a
cabin
from
which
keen
eyes
scrutinize
your
every
move
and
a
woman
cries
to
her
boy
run
kit
down
to
mederses
and
ax
who
he
as
you
approach
a
store
every
idler
pricks
up
to
instant
attention
your
presence
is
detected
from
every
neighboring
cabin
and
cornfield
long
john
quits
his
plowing
red
john
drops
his
axe
sick
john
who
allers
ailin
to
hear
tell
pops
out

and
lyin

mouth
ai
no

it
open
and
shet
grabs
his
hat
with
i
jes
got
ter
know
who
that
feller
is
then
all
johns
descend
their
several
paths
to
congregate
at
the
store
and
estimate
the
stranger
as
though
he
were
so
many
of
lumber
in
the
tree
or
so
many
pounds
of
beef
on
the
hoof
in
every
settlement
there
is
somebody
who
makes
a
pleasure
of
gathering
and
spreading
news
such
a
one
we
had
a
fellow
from
whom
they
said
you
can
hear
the
news
jinglin
afore
he
comes
within
gunshot
it
amused
me
to
record
the
many
ways
he
had
of
announcing
his
mission
by
indirection
here
is
the
list
i
jes
broguin
about
yes
i
jest
cooterin
around
i
santerin
about
oh
i
jes
prodjectin
around
jist
traffickin
about
no
i
ai
workin
none
jest
spuddin
around
me
i
jes
shacklin
around
yea
la
i
jist
loaferin
about
and
yet
one
hears
that
our
mountaineers
have
a
limited
vocabulary
although
this
is
no
place
to
discuss
the
mountain
dialect
i
must
explain
that
to
brogue
means
to
go
about
in
brogues
brogans
nowadays
a
cooter
is
a
and
the
noun
is
turned
into
a
verb
with
an
ease
characteristic
of
the
mountaineers
spuddin
around
means
toddling
or
jolting
along
to
shummick
also
shammick
is
to
shuffle
about
idly
nosing
into
things
as
a
bear
does
when
there
is
nothing
serious
in
view
and
shacklin
around
pictures
a
shackly
way
of
walking
expressive
of
the
idle
vagabond
a
stranger
takes
the
mountaineers
for
simple
characters
that
can
be
gauged
at
a
glance
this
illusion
for
it
is
an
illusion
comes
from
the
childlike
directness
with
which
they
ask
him
the
most
intimate
questions
about
himself
from
the
genuine
with
which
they
admit
him
to
their
homes
and
from
the
stark
openness
of
their
domestic
affairs
in
houses
where
no
privacy
can
possibly
exist
in
so
far
as
simplicity
means
only
a
shrewd
regard
for
essentials
a
rigid
exclusion
of
whatever
can
be
done
without
perhaps
no
white
race
is
nearer
a
state
of
nature
than
these
highlanders
of
ours
yet
this
relates
only
to
the
externals
of
life
diogenes
sat
in
a
tub
but
his
thoughts
were
deep
as
the
sea
and
whoever
estimates
our
mountaineers
as
a
or
people
has
much
to
learn
when
long
john
asks
what
you
aimin
to
do
up
hyur
how
much
money
do
you
make
whar
your
old
woman
he
does
not
really
expect
sincere
answers
certainly
he
will
take
them
with
more
than
a
grain
of
salt
conversation
with
him
is
a
game
in
quizzing
you
the
interests
that
he
is
actually
curious
about
lie
hidden
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
will
proceed
toward
them
by
cunning
circumventions
seeking
to
entrap
you
into
telling
the
truth
by
accident
being
himself
born
to
intrigue
and
skilled
in
dodging
the
leading
question
he
assumes
that
you
have
had
equal
advantages
when
you
discuss
with
him
any
business
of
serious
concern
if
you
should
go
straight
to
the
point
and
open
your
mind
frankly
he
would
be
nonplussed
the
fact
is
that
our
highlanders
are
a
sly
suspicious
and
secretive
folk
that
too
is
a
state
of
nature
primitive
society
is
by
no
means
a
utopia
or
a
garden
of
eden
in
wilderness
life
the
feral
arts
of
concealment
spying
false
leads
and
doubling
on
trails
are
the
arts
the
native
backwoodsman
practices
them
as
instinctively
and
with
as
little
compunction
upon
his
own
species
as
upon
the
deer
and
the
wolf
from
whom
he
learned
them
as
a
friend
no
one
will
spring
quicker
to
your
aid
reckless
of
consequences
and
fight
with
you
to
the
last
ditch
but
fear
of
betrayal
lies
at
the
very
bottom
of
his
nature
his
sleepless
suspicion
of
ulterior
motives
is
no
more
no
less
than
a
feral
trait
inherited
from
a
long
line
of
forebears
whose
isolated
lives
were
preserved
only
by
incessant
vigilance
against
enemies
that
stalked
by
night
and
struck
without
warning
casual
visitors
learn
nothing
about
the
true
character
of
the
mountaineers
i
am
not
speaking
of
personal
but
of
race
character
type
no
outsider
can
discern
and
measure
those
powerful
but
obscure
motives
those
rooted
prejudices
that
constitute
their
real
difference
from
other
men
until
he
has
lived
with
the
people
a
long
time
on
terms
of
intimacy
nor
can
anyone
be
trusted
to
portray
them
if
he
holds
a
brief
either
for
or
against
this
people
the
fluttering
tourist
marks
only
the
oddities
he
sees
without
knowing
the
reason
for
them
on
the
other
hand
a
misguided
champion
flies
to
arms
at
first
mention
of
an
unpleasant
fact
and
either
denies
it
clamoring
for
legal
proof
or
tries
to
befog
the
whole
subject
and
run
it
on
the
rocks
of
altercation
the
mountaineers
are
and
sensitive
to
criticism
no
one
has
less
use
for
that
worst
scourge
of
avenging
heaven
the
candid
friend
of
late
years
they
are
growing
conscious
of
their
own
belatedness
and
that
touches
a
tender
spot
hit
do
take
a
big
seed
to
hurt
a
sore
tooth
since
they
do
not
see
how
anyone
can
find
beauty
or
historic
interest
in
ways
of
life
that
the
rest
of
the
world
has
cast
aside
so
they
resent
every
exposure
of
their
peculiarities
as
if
that
were
holding
them
up
to
ridicule
or
blame
strange
to
say
it
provokes
them
to
be
called
mountaineers
that
being
a
furrin
word
which
they
take
as
a
term
of
reproach
they
call
themselves
mountain
people
or
citizens
sometimes
humorously
mountain
boomers
the
word
boomer
being
their
name
for
the
common
red
squirrel
which
is
found
here
only
in
the
upper
zones
of
the
mountains
backwoodsman
is
another
term
that
they
deem
opprobrious
among
themselves
the
backwoods
are
called
the
sticks
hillsman
and
highlander
are
strange
words
to
them
and
anything
that
is
strange
is
suspicious
hence
it
is
next
to
impossible
for
anyone
to
write
much
about
these
people
without
offending
them
or
else
falling
into
singsong
repetition
of
the
same
old
terms
i
have
found
it
beyond
me
to
convince
anyone
here
that
my
studies
of
the
mountain
dialect
are
made
from
any
better
motive
than
vulgar
curiosity
it
has
been
my
habit
to
jot
down
on
the
spot
every
dialectical
word
or
variant
or
idiom
that
i
hear
along
with
the
phrase
or
sentence
in
which
it
occurred
for
i
never
trust
memory
in
such
matters
and
although
i
tell
frankly
what
i
am
about
and
why
yet
all
that
the
folks
can
or
will
see
is
that
a
chiel
amang
ye
takin
notes
and
faith
he
prent
nothing
worse
than
dour
looks
has
yet
befallen
me
but
other
scribes
have
not
got
off
so
easy
on
more
than
one
occasion
newspaper
men
who
went
into
eastern
kentucky
to
report
feuds
were
escorted
forcibly
to
the
railroad
and
warned
never
to
return
the
feudists
are
scarce
to
blame
for
the
average
news
story
of
their
wars
is
neither
sacred
nor
profane
history
it
is
bad
enough
to
be
shown
up
as
an
assassin
but
when
one
is
posed
as
cocking
the
of
a
gun
or
shooting
a
bullet
from
a
automatic
who
in
kentucky
could
be
expected
to
stand
it
the
novelists
have
their
troubles
too
president
frost
relates
that
when
john
fox
gave
a
reading
from
his
cumberland
tales
at
berea
college
the
mountain
boys
were
ready
to
mob
him
they
had
no
comprehension
of
the
nature
of
fiction
fox
stories
were
either
true
or
false
if
they
were
true
then
he
was
gentleman
for
telling
all
the
family
affairs
of
people
who
had
entertained
him
with
their
best
if
they
were
not
true
then
of
course
they
were
libellous
upon
the
mountain
people
such
an
attitude
may
remind
us
of
the
general
condemnation
of
fiction
by
the
gude
a
generation
ago
illustration
the
schoolhouse
as
for
settlement
workers
let
them
teach
more
by
example
than
by
precept
bishop
wilson
has
given
them
some
advice
that
can
not
be
bettered
it
must
be
said
with
emphasis
that
our
problem
is
an
exceedingly
delicate
one
the
highlanders
are
in
their
and
proud
independence
those
who
would
help
them
must
do
so
in
a
perfectly
frank
and
kindly
way
showing
always
genuine
interest
in
them
but
never
a
trace
of
patronizing
condescension
as
quick
as
a
flash
the
mountaineer
will
recognize
and
resent
the
intrusion
of
any
such
spirit
and
will
refuse
even
what
he
sorely
needs
if
he
detects
in
the
accents
or
the
demeanor
of
the
giver
any
indication
of
an
air
of
superiority
the
worker
among
the
mountaineers
he
continues
must
with
them
on
the
level
and
part
on
the
square
and
conquer
their
oftentimes
unreasonable
suspicion
by
genuine
brotherly
friendship
the
less
he
has
to
say
about
the
superiority
of
other
sections
or
of
the
deficiencies
of
the
mountains
the
better
for
his
cause
the
fact
is
that
comparatively
few
workers
are
at
first
able
to
pass
muster
in
this
regard
under
the
searching
and
silent
scrutiny
of
the
mountain
people
allow
me
to
add
that
this
is
no
place
for
the
unco
gude
to
exercise
their
talents
but
rather
for
those
whose
studies
and
travels
have
taught
them
both
tolerance
and
hopefulness
some
missionaries
are
shocked
and
scandalized
at
what
seems
to
them
incurable
perversity
and
race
degeneration
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
there
are
reasons
good
reasons
for
the
worst
that
we
find
in
any
or
loafer
glory
all
that
is
the
inevitable
result
of
isolation
and
lack
of
opportunity
it
is
no
more
hopeless
than
the
same
features
of
life
were
in
the
scotch
highlands
two
centuries
ago
but
it
must
be
known
that
the
future
of
this
really
fine
race
is
at
bottom
an
economic
problem
which
must
be
studied
with
the
educational
one
civilization
only
repels
the
mountaineer
until
you
show
him
something
to
gain
by
it
he
knows
by
instinct
what
he
is
bound
to
lose
there
is
no
use
in
teaching
cleanliness
and
thrift
to
serfs
or
outcasts
the
of
the
mountain
farm
must
be
preserved
or
the
fine
spirit
of
the
race
will
vanish
and
all
that
is
manly
in
the
highlander
will
wither
to
the
core
it
is
far
from
my
own
purpose
to
preach
or
advise
portray
the
struggle
and
you
need
write
no
tract
still
farther
is
it
from
my
thought
to
let
characterization
degenerate
into
caricature
wherever
i
tell
anything
that
is
unusual
or
below
the
average
of
backwoods
life
i
give
fair
warning
that
it
is
admitted
only
for
spice
or
contrast
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
even
in
writing
with
severe
restraint
it
will
be
necessary
at
times
to
show
conditions
so
rude
and
antiquated
that
professional
apologists
will
growl
and
many
others
may
find
my
statements
hard
to
credit
as
typical
of
anything
at
all
in
our
modern
america
so
let
me
remind
the
reader
again
that
full
of
our
mountaineers
still
live
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
that
in
their
wilderness
away
from
large
rivers
and
railways
the
habits
customs
morals
of
the
people
have
changed
but
little
from
those
of
our
old
colonial
frontier
in
essentials
they
are
closely
analogous
to
what
we
read
of
english
and
scottish
life
in
covenanter
and
jacobite
times
chapter
x
the
people
of
the
hills
in
delineating
a
strange
race
we
are
prone
to
disregard
what
is
common
in
our
own
experience
and
observe
sharply
what
is
odd
the
oddities
we
sketch
and
remember
and
tell
about
but
there
is
little
danger
of
misrepresenting
the
physical
features
and
mental
traits
of
the
hill
people
because
among
them
there
is
one
definite
type
that
greatly
predominates
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
when
we
remember
that
fully
of
our
highlanders
are
practically
of
the
same
descent
have
lived
the
same
kind
of
life
for
generations
and
have
intermarried
to
a
degree
unknown
in
other
parts
of
america
our
average
mountaineer
is
lean
inquisitive
shrewd
if
that
be
what
constitutes
a
yankee
as
is
popularly
supposed
outside
of
new
england
then
this
yankee
of
the
south
is
as
true
to
type
as
the
conventional
uncle
sam
himself
a
fat
mountaineer
is
a
curiosity
the
hill
folk
even
seem
to
affect
a
slender
type
of
comeliness
in
alice
macgowan
of
the
old
jepthah
turrentine
says
of
one
of
his
sons
i
named
that
boy
after
the
finest
man
that
ever
walked
god
green
earth
and
then
the
fool
had
to
go
and
git
fat
on
me
think
of
me
with
a
son
i
allers
did
hold
that
a
fat
woman
was
bad
enough
but
a
fat
man
ort
to
be
led
out
and
killed
spartan
diet
does
not
put
on
flesh
still
it
should
be
noted
that
long
legs
baggy
clothing
and
scantiness
or
lack
of
underwear
make
people
seem
thinner
than
they
really
are
our
highlanders
are
conspicuously
a
tall
race
out
of
men
that
i
have
listed
just
as
they
occurred
to
me
but
four
are
below
average
american
height
and
only
two
are
fat
about
of
them
are
brawny
or
sinewy
fellows
of
great
endurance
the
others
generally
are
but
withey
the
townsfolk
and
the
valley
farmers
being
better
nourished
and
more
observant
of
the
prime
laws
of
wholesome
living
are
noticeably
superior
in
appearance
but
not
in
stamina
nearly
all
males
of
the
back
country
have
a
grave
and
deliberate
bearing
they
travel
with
the
long
stride
of
the
born
woodsman
not
graceful
and
lithe
like
a
moccasined
indian
their
coarse
brogans
forbid
it
but
shambling
as
if
every
joint
had
too
much
play
there
is
nothing
about
them
to
suggest
the
swiss
or
tyrolean
mountaineers
rather
they
resemble
the
gillies
of
the
scotch
highlands
generally
they
are
sallow
with
rather
high
gray
eyes
predominate
sometimes
vacuous
but
oftener
hard
searching
crafty
the
feral
eye
of
primitive
man
from
infancy
these
people
have
been
schooled
to
dissimulate
and
hide
emotion
and
ordinarily
their
faces
are
as
opaque
as
those
of
veteran
poker
players
many
wear
habitually
a
sullen
scowl
hateful
and
suspicious
which
in
men
of
combative
age
and
often
in
the
old
women
is
sinister
and
vindictive
the
smile
of
comfortable
assurance
the
frank
eye
of
are
rare
indeed
nearly
all
of
the
young
people
and
many
of
the
adults
plant
themselves
before
a
stranger
and
regard
him
with
a
fixed
stare
peculiarly
annoying
until
one
realizes
that
they
have
no
thought
of
impertinence
many
of
the
women
are
pretty
in
youth
but
hard
toil
in
house
and
field
early
marriage
frequent
with
shockingly
poor
attention
and
ignorance
or
defiance
of
the
plainest
necessities
of
hygiene
soon
warp
and
age
them
at
thirty
or
a
mountain
woman
is
apt
to
have
a
worn
and
faded
look
with
form
prematurely
bent
and
what
wonder
always
bending
over
the
hoe
in
the
cornfield
or
bending
over
the
hearth
as
she
cooks
by
an
open
fire
or
bending
over
her
baby
or
bending
to
pick
up
for
the
thousandth
time
the
wet
duds
that
her
lord
flings
on
the
floor
as
he
enters
from
the
woods
what
wonder
that
she
soon
grows
and
the
voices
of
the
highland
women
low
toned
by
habit
often
are
singularly
sweet
being
pitched
in
a
sad
musical
minor
key
with
strangers
the
women
are
wont
to
be
shy
but
speculative
rather
than
timid
as
they
glance
betimes
with
a
slow
long
look
of
mild
inquiry
or
of
general
listlessness
or
of
unconscious
and
unaccountable
melancholy
many
however
scrutinize
a
visitor
calmly
for
minutes
at
a
time
or
frankly
measure
him
with
the
gipsy
eye
of
carmen
outsiders
judging
from
the
fruits
of
labor
in
more
favored
lands
have
charged
the
mountaineers
with
indolence
it
is
the
wrong
word
shiftless
many
of
them
are
afflicted
with
that
malady
which
barrie
calls
acute
disinclination
to
work
but
that
is
not
so
much
in
their
physical
nature
as
in
their
economic
outlook
rarely
do
we
find
mountaineers
who
loaf
all
day
on
the
floor
or
the
doorstep
like
so
many
of
the
poor
whites
of
the
lowlands
if
not
laboring
they
at
least
must
be
doing
something
be
it
no
more
than
walking
ten
miles
to
shoot
a
squirrel
or
visit
a
crony
as
a
class
they
have
great
and
restless
physical
energy
considering
the
quantity
and
quality
of
what
they
eat
there
is
no
people
who
can
beat
them
in
endurance
of
strain
and
privation
they
are
great
walkers
and
carriers
of
burdens
before
there
was
a
in
our
settlement

of
my
neighbors
used
to
go
every
other
week
thirteen
miles
to
mill
carrying
a
sack
of
corn
pounds
and
returning
with
his
meal
on
the
following
day
this
was
done
without
any
but
simply

the
load

shoulder

eighteen

across

at

elevation

to
shop
more
advantageously
than
she
could
at
home
the
next
day
she
shouldered
fifty
pounds
of
flour
and
some
other
groceries
and
bore
them
home
before
nightfall
uncle
jimmy
crawford
in
his
year
came
to
join
a
party
of
us
on

walked
twelve
miles
across
the

carrying
his
equipment
and
four

for

had
gone
on

it
showers

sometimes
may
see
adults
and
children
going
barefoot
in
snow
that
is
ankle
deep
it
used
to
be
customary
in
our
settlement
to
do
the
morning
chores
barefooted
in
the
snow
then
said
one
our
feet
tingle
and
burn
so
they
would
git
a
bit
cold
all
day
when
we
put
our
shoes
on
i
knew
a
family
whose
children
had
no
shoes
all
one
winter
and
occasionally
we
had
zero
weather
it
seems
to
have
been
common
in
earlier
times
to
go
barefooted
all
the
year
frederick
law
olmsted
a
noted
writer
of
the
civil
war
period
was
told
by
a
squire
of
the
tennessee
hills
that
a
majority
of
the
folks
went
barefoot
all
winter
though
they
had
snow
much
of
the
time
four
or
five
inches
deep
and
the
man
said
he
did
think
most
of
the
men
about
here
had
more
than
one
coat
and
they
never
wore
one
in
winter
except
on
holidays
was
the
healthiest
way
he
reckoned
to
toughen
yourself
and
not
wear
no
coat
no
matter
how
cold
it
was
he
wear
no
coat
one
of
my
own
neighbors
in
the
smokies
never
owned
a
coat
until
after
his
marriage
when
a
friend
of
mine
gave
him
one
it
is
the
usual
thing
for
men
and
boys
to
wade
cold
trout
streams
all
day
come
in
at
sunset
disrobe
to
shirt
and
trousers
and
then
sit
in
the
piercing
drafts
of
an
open
cabin
drying
out
before
the
fire
though
the
night
be
so
cool
that
a
stranger
beside
them
shivers
in
his
dry
flannels
after
supper
the
women
if
they
have
been
wearing
shoes
will
remove
them
to
ease
their
feet
no
matter
if
it
be
freezing
cold
and
the
cracks
in
the
floor
may
be
an
inch
wide
in
bear
hunting
our
parties
usually
camped
at
about
feet
above
sea
level
at
this
elevation
in
the
long
nights
before
christmas
the
cold
often
was
bitter
and
the
wind
might
blow
a
gale
sometimes
the
native
hunters
would
lie
out
in
the
open
all
night
without
a
sign
of
a
blanket
or
an
axe
they
would
say
la
many
the
night
i
been
out
when
the
frost
was
spewed
up
so
high
measuring
three
or
four
inches
with
the
hand
and
that
right
around
the
fire
too
cattle
hunters
in
the
mountains
never
carry
a
blanket
or
a
and
they
sleep
out
wherever
night
finds
them
often
in
pouring
rain
or
flying
snow
on
their
arduous
trips
they
find
it
burden
enough
to
carry
the
salt
for
their
cattle
with
a
cup
corn
pone
coffee
and
all
in
a
grain
sack
strapped
to
the
man
back
such
nurture
from
childhood
makes
white
men
as
indifferent
to
the
elements
as
fuegians
and
it
makes
them
anything
but
comfortable
companions
for
one
who
has
been
differently
reared
during
court
week
when
the
hotels
at
the
are
overcrowded
with
countrymen
the
luckless
drummers
who
happen
to
be
there
have
continuous
exercise
in
closing
doors
no
mountaineer
closes
a
door
behind
him
winter
or
summer
doors
are
to
be
shut
only
when
folks
go
to
bed
that
is
what
they
are
for
after
close
study
of
mountain
speech
i
have
failed
to
discern
that
the
word
draft
is
understood
except
in
parts
of
the
virginia
and
kentucky
mountains
where
it
means
a
brook
one
is
reminded
of
the
colonial
who
visiting
england
remarked
of
the
british
people
it
is
a
survival
of
the
fittest
the
fittest
to
exist
in
fog
here
it
is
the
fittest
to
survive
cold
and
wet
and
drafts
running
barefooted
in
the
snow
is
exceptional
nowadays
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
limit
of
hardiness
or
callosity
that
some
of
these
people
display
it
is
not
so
long
ago
that
i
passed
an
open
of
chestnut
bark
far
back
in
the
wilderness
wherein
a
family
of
tennesseans
was
spending
the
year
there
were
three
children
the
eldest
a
lad
of
twelve
the
entire
worldly
possessions
of
this
family
could
easily
be
packed
around
on
their
backs
poverty
however
does
not
account
for
such
manner
of
living
there
is
none
so
poor
in
the
mountains
that
he
need
rear
his
children
in
a
bark
shed
it
is
all
a
matter
of
taste
there
is
a
wealthy
man
known
to
everyone
around
waynesville
who
being
asked
where
he
resided
as
a
witness
in
court
answered
three
four
miles
up
and
down
jonathan
creek
the
judge
was
about
to
fine
him
for
contempt
when
it
developed
that
the
witness
spoke
literal
truth
he
lives
neither
in
house
nor
camp
but
perambulates
his
large
estate
and
when
night
comes
lies
down
wherever
he
may
happen
to
be
in
winter
he
has
been
known
to
go
where
some
of
his
pigs
bedded
in
the
woods
usurp
the
middle
for
himself
and
borrow
comfort
from
their
bodily
heat
this
man
is
worth
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
he
visited
the
world
fairs
at
chicago
and
louis
wearing
the
old
long
coat
that
serves
him
also
as
blanket
and
carrying
his
rations
in
a
sack
far
from
being
demented
he
is
notoriously
so
shrewd
on
the
stand
and
so
learned
in
the
law
that
he
is
formidable
to
every
attorney
who
him
i
cite
these
last
two
instances
not
merely
as
eccentricities
of
character
but
as
really
typical
of
the
bodily
stamina
that
most
of
the
mountaineers
can
display
if
they
want
to
their
smiling
endurance
of
cold
and
wet
and
privation
would
have
endeared
them
to
the
first
napoleon
who
declared
that
those
soldiers
were
the
best
who
bivouacked
shelterless
throughout
the
year
in
spite
of
such
apparent
toughness
the
mountaineers
are
not
a
notably
healthy
people
the
man
who
exposes
himself
wantonly
year
after
year
must
pay
the
piper
sooner
or
later
he
adopts
a
rheumatiz
and
the
adoption
lasts
till
he
dies
so
also
in
dietary
matters
the
backwoodsmen
through
ruthless
of
the
normally
sensitive
have
acquired
a
wonderful
tolerance
of
swimming
grease
doughy
bread
and
cabbage
but
even
so
they
are
gnawed
by
dyspepsia
this
accounts
in
great
measure
for
the
glunch
o
sour
disdain
that
mars
so
many
countenances
a
neighbor
said
to
me
of
another
he
has
a
gredge
agin
all
creation
and
glories
in
human
misery
so
would
anyone
else
who
ate
at
the
same
table
many
a
homicide
in
the
mountains
can
be
traced
directly
to
bad
food
and
the
raw
whiskey
taken
to
appease
a
soured
stomach
every
stranger
in
appalachia
is
quick
to
note
the
high
percentage
of
defectives
among
the
people
however
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
mountains
proper
there
are
few
if
any
public
refuges
for
this
class
and
that
home
ties
are
so
powerful
that
mountaineers
never
send
their
fitified
folks
or
or
other
unfortunates
to
any
institution
in
the
lowlands
so
long
as
it
is
bearable
to
have
them
around
such
poor
creatures
as
would
be
segregated
in
more
advanced
communities
far
from
the
public
eye
here
go
at
large
and
reproduce
their
kind
extremely
early
marriages
are
tolerated
as
among
all
primitive
people
i
knew
a
hobbledehoy
of
sixteen
who
married
a
frail
tuberculous
girl
of
twelve
and
in
the
same
small
settlement
another
lad
of
sixteen
who
wedded
a
girl
of
thirteen
in
both
cases
the
result
was
wretched
beyond
description
the
evil
consequences
of
inbreeding
of
persons
closely
akin
are
well
known
to
the
mountaineers
but
here
knowledge
is
no
deterrent
since
whole
districts
are
interrelated
to
start
with
owing
to
the
isolation
of
the
clans
and
their
extremely
limited
travels
there
are
abundant
cases
like
those
caustically
mentioned
in
all
skeets
and
bushees
and
married
back
and
forth
and
crossways
and
upside
down
till
man
is
his
own
grandmother
if
he
only
knew
enough
to
figger
relationship
the
mountaineers
are
touchy
on
these
topics
and
it
is
but
natural
that
they
should
be
so
nevertheless
it
is
the
plain
duty
of
society
to
study
such
conditions
and
apply
the
remedy
there
was
a
time
when
the
scotch
people
to
cite
only
one
instance
out
of
many
were
in
still
worse
case
threatened
with
race
degeneration
but
improved
economic
conditions
followed
by
education
made
them
over
into
one
of
the
most
vigorous
of
modern
peoples
when
i
lived
up
in
the
smokies
there
was
no
doctor
within
sixteen
miles
and
then
none
who
ever
had
attended
a
medical
school
it
was
inevitable
that
my
kit
and
limited
knowledge
of
medicine
should
be
requisitioned
until
i
became
a
sort
of
doctor
to
the
my
services
being
free
at
once
became
popular
and
there
was
no
escape
for
if
i
treated
the
smiths
let
us
say
and
ignored
a
call
from
the
robinsons
the
slight
would
be
resented
by
all
robinson
connections
throughout
the
land
so
my
normal
occupations
often
were
interrupted
by
such
calls
as
these

over
to
mis
fullwiler
quick
she
fell
down
and
busted
a
rib
inside
o
her
on
these
errands
of
mercy
i
soon
picked
up
some
rules
of
practice
that
are
not
laid
down
in
the
books
i
learned
to
carry
not
only
my
own
bandages
but
my
own
towels
and
utensils
for
washing
and
sterilizing
i
kept
my
mouth
shut
about
germ
theories
of
disease
having
no
troops
to
enforce
orders
and
finding
that
mere
advice
incited
downright
perversity
i
administered
potent
drugs
in
person
and
left
nothing
to
be
taken
according
to
direction
except
placebos
once
in
forgetfulness
i
left
a
tablet
of
corrosive
sublimate
on
the
mantel
after
dressing
a
wound
and
the
man
of
the
house
told
me
next
day
that
he
had
to
swaller
it
and
see
if
it
would
ease
his
headache
a
geologist
and
i
exploring
the
hills
with
a
mountaineer
fell
into
discussion
of
filth
diseases
and
germs
not
realizing
that
we
were
overheard
happening
to
pass
an
frank
remarked
to
me
that
formic
acid
was
supposed
to
be
antagonistic
to
the
germ
of
laziness
instantly
we
heard
a
growl
from
our
woodsman
by
god
i
was
to
hear
the
like
o
that
ordinarily
wounds
are
stanched
with
dusty
cobwebs
and
bound
up
in
any
old
rag
if
infection
ensues
providence
has
to
take
the
blame
a
woman
gashed
her
foot
badly
with
an
axe
i
asked
her
what
she
did
for
it
disdainfully
she
answered
tied
it
up
in
sut
and
a
rag
and
went
to
hoein
corn
an
injured
person
gets
scant
sympathy
if
any
so
far
as
outward
demeanor
goes
and
public
comment
the
witnesses
are
utterly
callous
the
same
indifference
is
shown
in
the
face
of
impending
death
people
crowd
around
with
no
other
motive
seemingly
than
morbid
curiosity
to
see
a
person
die
i
asked
our
local
preacher
what
the
folks
would
do
if
a
man
broke
his
thigh
so
that
the
bone
protruded
he
merely
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
replied
we
set
around
and
sing
until
he
died
the
mountaineers
fortitude
under
severe
pain
is
heroic
though
often
needless
for
all
minor
operations
and
frequently
for
major
ones
they
obstinately
refuse
to
take
an
anesthetic
being
perversely
suspicious
of
everything
that
they
do
not
understand
their
own
minor
surgery
and
obstetric
practice
is
barbarous
a
large
proportion
of
the
mountain
doctors
know
less
about
human
anatomy
than
a
butcher
does
about
a
pig
sometimes
this
ignorance
passes
below
ordinary
common
sense
there
is
a
doctor
still
practicing
who
after
a
case
of
confinement
sits
beside
the
patient
and
presses
hard
upon
the
hips
for
half
an
hour
explaining
that
it
is
to
push
the
bones
back
into
place
do
you
know
they
allers
comes
uncoupled
in
the
socket
this
i
suppose
is
the
limit
but
there
are
very
many
practicing
physicians
in
the
back
country
who
could
not
name
or
locate
the
arteries
of
either
foot
or
hand
to
save
their
lives
it
was
here
i
first
heard
of
let
one
of
my
old
neighbors
tell
it
in
his
own
way
you
take
a
cut
nail
not
one
o
those
round
wire
nails
and
place
its
squar
agin
the
ridge
of
the
tooth
jest
under
the
edge
of
the
gum
then
jump
the
tooth
out
with
a
hammer
a
man
who
knows
how
can
jump
a
tooth
without
it
hurtin
half
as
bad
as
pullin
but
old
uncle
neddy
cyarter
went
to
jump
one
of
his
own
teeth
out
one
time
and
missed
the
nail
and
mashed
his
nose
with
the
hammer
he
had
the
weak
trembles
i
have
heard
of
said
i
and
reported
it
to
dentists
back
home
but
they
laughed
at
me
well
they
need
laugh
for
it
so
some
men
git
to
be
as
experienced
at
it
as
are
at
pullin
they
cut
around
the
gum
and
then
put
the
nail
at
jest
sich
an
angle
slantin
downward
for
an
upper
tooth
or
upwards
for
a
lower
one
and
hit
one
lick
will
the
tooth
come
at
the
first
lick
ginerally
if
it
did
you
might
as
well
stick
your
head
in
a
swarm
o
bees
and
fergit
who
you
are
are
back
teeth
extracted
in
that
way
yes
sir
any
kind
of
a
tooth
i
burnt
my
holler
teeth
out
with
a
wire
good
god
hit
so
the
wire
sizzle
like
fryin
kill
the
nerve
no
but
it
sear
the
mar
so
it
would
be
so
sensitive
did
hurt
eh
hurt
like
hell
for
a
moment
i
held
the
wire
one
time
for
jim
bob
jimwright
who
could
reach
the
spot
for
hisself
i
him
to
hold
his
tongue
back
but
when
i
touched
the
holler
he
jumped
and
wropped
his
tongue
agin
the
wire
the
words
that
man
used
ai
fitty
to
tell
some
of
the
ailments
common
in
the
mountains
were
new
to
me
for
instance
dew
pizen
presumably
the
poison
of
some
weed
which
dissolved
in
dew
enters
the
blood
through
a
scratch
or
abrasion
as
a
woman
described
it
dew
pizen
comes
like
a
risin
and
how
it
does
hurt
i
stove
a
brier
in
my
heel
wunst
and
then
had
to
hunt
cows
every
morning
in
the
dew
my
leg
swelled
up
black
to
clar
above
the
knee
and
stinchcomb
lanced
the
place
seven
times
i
lay
on
a
pallet
on
the
floor
for
over
a
month
my
leg
like
to
killed
me
i
seed
persons
jest
a
lot
o
sores
all
over
as
big
as
my
hand
from
dew
pizen
a
more
mysterious
disease
is
which
prevails
in
certain
restricted
districts
chiefly
where
the
cattle
graze
in
rich
and
deeply
shaded
coves
if
not
properly
treated
it
is
fatal
both
to
the
cow
and
to
any
human
being
who
drinks
her
fresh
milk
or
eats
her
butter
it
is
not
transmitted
by
sour
milk
or
by
buttermilk
there
is
a
characteristic
fetor
of
the
breath
it
is
said
that
milk
from
an
infected
cow
will
not
foam
and
that
silver
is
turned
black
by
it
mountaineers
are
divided
in
opinion
as
to
whether
this
disease
is
of
vegetable
or
of
mineral
origin
some
think
it
is
an
efflorescence
from
gas
that
settles
on
plants
this
much
is
certain
that
it
disappears
from
coves
when
they
are
cleared
of
timber
and
the
sunlight
let
in
the
prevalent
treatment
is
an
emetic
followed
by
large
doses
of
apple
brandy
and
honey
then
oil
to
open
the
bowels
perhaps
the
extraordinary
distaste
for
fresh
milk
and
butter
or
the
universal
suspicion
of
these
foods
that
mountaineers
evince
in
so
many
localities
may
have
sprung
up
from
experience
with
cows
i
have
not
found
this
malady
mentioned
in
any
treatise
on
medicine
yet
it
has
been
known
from
our
earliest
frontier
times
abraham
lincoln
mother
died
of
it
that
the
hill
folk
remain
a
rugged
and
hardy
people
in
spite
of
unsanitary
conditions
so
gross
that
i
can
barely
hint
at
them
is
due
chiefly
to
their
love
of
pure
air
and
pure
water
no
mountain
cabin
needs
a
window
to
ventilate
it
there
are
cracks
and
everywhere
and
as
i
have
said
the
doors
are
always
open
except
at
night
tight
houses
sheathed
or
plastered
are
universally
despised
partly
from
inherited
shiftlessness
partly
for
less
obvious
reasons
one
of
miss
macgowan
characters
fairly
insulted
the
neighborhood
by
building
a
modern
house
why
lordy
lookee
hyer
creed
remonstrated
doss
provine
over
a
question
of
matching
boards
and
battening
joints
ef
you
git
yo
pen
so
almighty
tight
as
that
you
wo
git
no
fresh
air
man
bound
to
have
ventilation
course
you
can
leave
the
do
open
all
the
time
like
do
but
when
you
and
maybe
you
want
to
shet
the
do
sometimes
and
then
ye
git
breath
to
breathe
all
these
here
glass
winders
is
blame
foolishness
to
ef
ye
need
light
open
the
do
ef
somebody
comes
that
ye
do
want
in
you
can
shet
it
and
put
up
a
bar
but
saw
the
walls
full
o
holes
an
set
in
glass
winders
an
any
feller
that
got
a
mind
to
can
pick
ye
off
with
a
rifle
ball
as
easy
as
not
whilst
ye
set
by
the
fire
of
an
evenin
when
mountain
people
move
to
the
lowlands
and
go
to
living
in
houses
they
soon
deteriorate
like
indians
it
is
of
no
use
to
teach
them
to
ventilate
by
lowering
windows
from
the
top
that
is
some
more
blame
foolishness
their
adherence
to
old
ways
is
stubborn
sullen
and
perverse
to
a
degree
that
others
can
not
comprehend
then
too
in
the
lowlands
they
simply
can
not
stand
the
water
as
emma
miles
says
no
other
advantages
will
ever
make
up
for
the
lack
of
good
water
there
is
a
strong
prejudice
against
pumps
if
a
well
must
be
dug
it
is
usually
left
open
to
the
air
and
the
water
is
reached
by
means
of
a
hooked
pole
which
requires
some
skillful
manipulation
to
prevent
losing
the
bucket
cisterns
are
considered
filthy
water
that
has
stood
overnight
is
water
hardly
fit
to
wash
one
face
in
the
mountaineer
takes
the
same
pride
in
his
water
supply
as
the
rich
man
in
his
wine
cellar
and
is
in
this
respect
a
connoisseur
none
but
the
purest
and
coldest
of
freestone
will
satisfy
him
once
when
i
was
staying
in
a
lumber
camp
on
the
tennessee
side
near
the
top
of
smoky
my
friend
bob
and
i
tramped
down
to
the
nearest
town
ten
miles
for
supplies
we
did
not
start
until
after
dinner
and
intended
to
spend
the
night
at
a
hotel
it
was
a
sultry
day
and
we
arrived
very
thirsty
bob
took
some
into
his
mouth
and
instantly
spat
it
out
exclaiming
be
damned
if
i
stay
here
that
ai
fit
to
drink
i
goin
back
and
back
he
would
have
gone
ten
miles
up
a
hard
grade
at
night
if
someone
had
not
shown
us

a

veil
of
falling

a
little
colony
of
our
hazel
creek
people
took
a
notion
to
try
the
georgia
cotton
mills
they
nearly
died
there
from
homesickness
tight
houses
and
bad
water
all
but
one
family
returned
as
soon
as
they
possibly
could
while
trying
to
save
enough
money
to
get
away
one
old
man
said
i
lied
to
my
god
when
i
left
the
mountains
and
kem
to
these
devilish
cotton
mills
ef
only
he
turn
me
into

run

boys
i
dream
i
in

when
i
wake
up
i
lay

an

o

an
i

could
i
git
me
one

be
content
to
lay

down
and
die
poor
old
john
in
his
country
there
are
a
hundred
spring
branches
running
over
poplar
roots
but
poplar
we
knew
the
very
one
he
meant
it
was
by
the
roadside
the
brooklet
came
from
a
disused
hidden
in
laurel
and
hemlock
so
dense
that
direct
sunlight
never
penetrated
the
glen
cold
and
sparkling
and
crystal
clear
the
gushing
water
enticed
every
wayfarer
to
bend
and
drink
whether
he
was
thirsty
or
no
john
is
back
in
his
own
land
now
and
doubtless
often
goes
to
drink
of
that
veritable
fountain
of
youth
chapter
xi
the
land
of
do
without
homespun
jeans
and
linsey
used
to
be
the
universal
garb
of
the
mountain
people
nowadays
you
will
seldom
find
them
except
in
places
shoddy
store
clothes
are
cheaper
and
easier
to
get
and
this
is
a
sorry
change
for
the
material
was
sound
and
enduring
the
direct
product
of
hard
personal
toil
and
so
it
was
prized
and
taken
care
of
whereas
such
stuff
as
a
backwoodsman
can
buy
in
his
crossroads
store
is
flimsy
soon
loses
shape
and
breaks
down
his
own
pride
of
personal
appearance
our
average
hillsman
now
goes
about
in
a
dirty
blue
shirt
wapsy
and
ragged
trousers
toggled
up
with
a
nail
or
two
thick
socks
sagging
untidily
over
rusty
brogans
and
a
huge
black
floppy
hat
that
desecrates
the
landscape
presently
his
hatband
disappears
to
be
replaced
with
a
groundhog
thong
woven
in
and
out
of
knife
slits
like
a
shoestring
when
he
comes
home
he
hangs
his
hat
on
the
floor
until
his
wife
picks
it
up
he
never
brushes
it
in
time
that
battered
old
headpiece
becomes
as
pliant
to
its
owner
whim
as
expressive
of
his
mood
as
a
cap
in
the
circus
commonly
it
is
a
symbol
of
shiftlessness
and
unconcern
a
touch
and
it
becomes
a
banner
of
defiance
to
law
and
order
to
meet
on
some
lonesome
road
at
night
a
horseman
enveloped
to
the
heels
in
a
black
slicker
and
topped
with
one
of
those
prodigious
funnels
that
conceals
his
features
like
a
cowl
is
to
face
the
ku
klux
or
the
spanish
inquisition
when
your
young
mountaineer
is
properly
filled
up
on
corn
liquor
and
feels
like
challenging
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
he
pins
up
the
front
of
his
hat
with
a
thorn
sticks
a
sprig
of
balsam
or
cedar
in
the
thong
for
an
aigrette
and
then
gallops
forth
with
bottle
and
pistol
to
tilt
against
whatsoever
may
dare
oppose
him
and
on
the
gray
dawn
of
the
morning
after
you
may
find
lying
wilted
in
a
corner
as
crumpled
spiritless
and
forlorn
as
its
owner
upon
whom
we
charitably
drop
the
curtain
i
doubt
though
if
anywhere
in
this
wide
world
mere
personal
appearance
is
more
deceitful
than
among
our
mountaineers
the
slovenly
lout
whom
you
shrink
from
approaching
against
the
wind
is
one
of
the
most
independent
and
fellows
on
earth
as
quick
to
resent
alms
as
to
return
a
blow
and
it
is
wonderful
what
soap
and
clean
clothes
will
do
about
the
worst
specimen
of
that
i
ever
saw
outside
of
trampdom
used
to
come
into
town
every
week
always
with
a
loaded
winchester
on
his
shoulder
he
may
have
washed
his
face
now
and
then
but
there
was
no
sign
that
he
ever
combed
his
mane
i
took
him
for
one
of
those
defectives
alluded
to
in
a
previous
chapter
but
no
i
was
told
he
was
nobody
fool
the
rifle
it
was
explained
never
left
his
hand
when
he
was
abroad
they
said
that
a
feud
was
brewing
over
on
and
that
this
man
was
in
the
bilin
well
it
boiled
over
and
the
person
in
question
killed
two
men
in
front
of
his
own
door
when
the
prisoner
was
brought
into
court
i
could
not
recognize
him
a
bath
the
barber
and
a
new
store
suit
had
transformed
him
into
a
right
fellow
anything
but
a
tramp
anything
but
a
desperado
he
bore
himself
throughout
that
grilling
ordeal
like
the
downright
man
he
was
made
out
a
clear
case
of
was
set
at
liberty
and
promptly
reverted
to
a
condition
in
which
he
is
recognizable
once
more
the
women
of
the
back
country
usually
go
bareheaded
around
home
and
often
barefooted
too
as
did
the
daughters
of
highland
chiefs
a
century
or
two
ago
and
for
the
same
reason
simply
that
they
feel
better
so
when
or
expecting
visitors
their
extremities
are
clad
they
make
their
own
dresses
and
the
style
seems
never
to
change
when
traveling
horseback
they
use
a
man
saddle
and
ride
astride
in
their
ordinary
skirts
with
an
ingenuity
of
tucking
up
that
is
beyond
my
understanding
as
no
doubt
it
should
be
often
one
sees
a
man
and
a
woman
riding
in
which
case
the
lady
perches
sidewise
of
course
if
i
were
disposed
to
startle
the
reader
after
the
manner
of
impressionistic
writers
who
strive
after
effect
at
any
cost
i
could
fill
a
book
with
oddities
observed
in
the
mountains
and
that
without
exaggeration
by
commission
or
omission
let
one
or
two
anecdotes
suffice
and
then
we
will
get
back
to
our
averages
again
i
took
down
the
following
incident
verbatim
save
for
proper
names
from
lips
that
i
know
to
be
truthful
it
is
introduced
here
as
a
specimen
of
vivid
offhand
description
in
few
words
there
was
a
on
that
was
named
higgins
and
another
named
the
mcbees
they
married
through
and
through
till
the
whole
gineration
nigh
run
out
though
what
helped
was
that
they
fly
mad
sometimes
and
kill
one
another
like
fools
they
had
great
big
heads
and
mottly
faces
ears
as
big
as
sheepskins
well
when
they
dressed
up
to
come
to
church
the
men
grown
men
have
shirts
made
of
this
common
domestic
with
the
letters
on
their
backs
and
them
barefooted
and
some
without
hats
but
with
three
yards
of
red
ribbon
around
their
necks
the
sleeves
of
their
shirts
looked
like
a
whole
web
of
cloth
jest
sewed
up
together
and
them
sleeves
git
full
o
wind
and
that
red
ribbon
o
my
la
there
was
lots
o
leetle
boys
of
that
kem
only
in
their
there
was
cracks
between
the
logs
that
a
dog
could
jump
through
and
them
leetle
fellers
git
a
crack
and
grin
in
at
us
all
through
the
sarmon
ai
no
manner
o
use
to
ax
me
what
the
was
that
day
i
may
explain
that
it
still
is
common
in
many
districts
of
the
mountain
country
for
small
boys
to
go
about
through
the
summer
in
a
single
abbreviated
garment
and
that
they
are
called
boys
some
of
the
expedients
that
mountain
girls
invent
to
make
themselves
attractive
are
bizarre
in
the
extreme
without
invading
the
sanctities
of
toilet
i
will
cite
one
instance
that
is
interesting
from
a
scientific
viewpoint
they
told
me
that
a
certain
girl
thought
that
black
eyes
were
purtier
and
that
she
actually
changed
her
eyes
to
jet
black
whenever
she
went
to
meetin
or
other
public
gathering
while
i
could
see
how
the
trick
might
be
worked
it
seemed
utterly
absurd
that
an
unschooled
maid
of
the
wilderness
could
acquire
either
the
knowledge
or
the
means
to
accomplish
such
change
well
one
day
i
was
called
to
treat
a
sick
baby
while
waiting
for
the
medicine
to
react
i
chanced
to
mention
this
tale
as
it
had
been
told
me
the
father
who
had
blue
eyes
solemnly
assured
me
that
there
was
no
lie
about
it
and
said
he
would
convince
me
in
a
few
minutes
he
stepped
to
the
garden
and
plucked
a
leaf
of
jimson
weed
his
wife
crushed
the
leaf
and
instilled
a
drop
of
its
juice
into
one
of
his
eyes
i
took
out
my
watch
one
side
of
the
eyeball
reddened
slightly
the
man
said
hit
smarts
a
leetle
not
much
within
fifteen
minutes
the
pupil
had
expanded
like
a
cat
eye
in
the
dark
leaving
a
rim
of
blue
iris
so
thin
as
to
be
quite
unnoticeable
without
close
inspection
the
eye
consequently
was
jet
black
and
its
expression
utterly
changed
my
host
said
it
did
not
affect
his
vision
materially
save
that
things
glimmer
a
bit
i
met
him
again
the
next
day
and
he
still
was
an
creature
indeed
with
one
eye
a
light
blue
and
the
other
an
absolute
black
the
thing
puzzled
me
until
i
recalled
that
the
latin
name
of
jimson
weed
is
then
in
a
flash
it
came
to
me
that
stramonium
is
a
powerful
mydriatic
if
our
man
killer
hitherto
mentioned
had
had
blue
or
gray
eyes
and
had
not
chosen
to
stand
trial
then
with
a
cake
of
soap
and
a
new
suit
and
a
jimson
leaf
he
might
have
made
himself
over
so
that
his
own
mother
would
not
have
known
him
these
simple
facts
are
offered
gratis
to
writers
of
detective
tales
whose
stock
of
disguises
nowadays
is
so
threadbare
and
pardon
me
so
absurd
the
mountain
home
of
is
the
log
cabin
of
the
american
pioneer
not
such
a
lodge
as
people
affect
in
adirondack
camps
which
cost
more
than
framed
structures
of
similar
size
but
a
pen
that
can
be
erected
by
four
corner
men
in
one
day
and
is
finished
by
the
owner
at
his
leisure
the
commonest
type
is
a
single
large
room
with
maybe
a
narrow
porch
in
front
and
a
plank
door
a
big
stone
chimney
at
one
end
a
single
sash
for
a
window
at
the
other
and
a
seven
or
at
the
rear
for
kitchen
illustration
an
average
mountain
cabin
some
of
the
early
settlers
who
had
first
choice
of
land
took
pains
in
building
their
houses
squaring
the
logs
like
bridge
timbers
joining
them
closely
smoothing
their
puncheons
with
an
adze
almost
as
truly
as
if
they
were
planed
and
using
mortar
instead
of
clay
in
laying
chimney
and
hearth
but
such
houses
nowadays
are
rare
if
a
man
can
afford
so
much
effort
as
all
that
he
will
build
a
framed
dwelling
if
not
he
will
content
himself
with
such
a
cabin
as
i
have
described
if
he
prospers
he
may
add
a
duplicate
of
it
alongside
and
cover
the
whole
with
one
roof
leaving
a
ten
or
entry
between
in
carolina
they
seldom
build
a
house
of
round
logs
but
rather
hew
the
inner
and
outer
faces
flat
out
of
a
curious
notion
that
this
adds
an
appearance
of
finish
to
the
structure
if
only
they
would
turn
the
logs
over
so
that
the
flat
faces
joined
leaving
at
least
the
outside
in
the
natural
round
the
house
would
need
hardly
any
chinking
and
the
effect
would
be
far
more
pleasing
to
good
taste
as
it
is
they
merely
notch
the
logs
at
the
corners
leaving
wide
spaces
to
be
filled
up
with
splits
rocks
mud
anything
to
keep
out
the
weather
as
a
matter
of
fact
few
houses
ever
are
thoroughly
chinked
and
he
who
would
take
pains
to
make
a
workmanlike
job
of
chinking
would
be
ridiculed
as
fussin
around
like
an
old
nobody
but
a
tenderfoot
feels
drafts
you
know
it
is
hard
to
keep
such
a
dwelling
clean
even
if
the
family
be
small
the
whole
structure
being
built
of
green
timber
throughout
soon
shrinks
checks
warps
and
sags
so
that
there
can
not
be
a
square
joint
a
neat
fit
a
perpendicular
face
or
a
level
place
anywhere
about
it
the
roof
droops
in
a
season
or
two
the
shingles
curl
and
leaky
places
open
flooring
shrinks
apart
leaving
wide
and
irregular
cracks
through
which
the
winter
winds
are
sucked
upward
as
through
so
many
flues
no
mountain
home
has
a
cellar
under
it
everywhere
there
are
crannies
and
rough
surfaces
to
hold
dust
and
soot
there
being
probably
not
a
single
planed
board
in
the
whole
house
but
for
all
that
there
is
something
very
attractive
and
picturesque
about
the
little
old
log
cabin
in
its
setting
of
ancient
forests
and
mighty
hills
it
fits
it
harmonizes
where
the
prim
and
precise
product
of
modern
carpentry
would
shock
an
artistic
eye
the
very
roughness
of
the
honest
logs
and
the
furniture
gives
texture
to
the
picture
having
no
mathematically
straight
lines
nor
uniform
curves
the
cabin
outlines
conform
to
its
surroundings
without
artificial
stain
or
varnish
or
veneer
it
what
it
seems
a
genuine
thing
a
jewel
in
the
rough
and
it
is
a
home
when
wind
whistles
through
the
cracks
and
snow
sifts
into
the
corners
of
the
room
one
draws
his
stumpy
little
chair
close
to
the
wide
hearth
and
really
knows
the
comfort
of
fire
leaping
and
sap
singing
from
big
birch
logs
every
room
except
the
kitchen
if
there
be
a
kitchen
has
a
couple
of
beds
in
it
enough
all
told
for
the
family
and
generally
one
spare
bed
if
much
company
comes
some
pallets
are
made
on
the
floor
for
the
women
and
children
of
the
household
in
a
cabin
there
usually
is
a
cockloft
reached
by
a
ladder
for
storage
and
maybe
a
bunk
or
two
closets
and
pantries
there
are
none
for
they
would
only
furnish
good
harborage
for
and
other
vermin
everything
must
be
in
sight
and
accessible
to
the
housewife
little
sedge
broom
linen
and
small
articles
of
apparel
are
stored
in
a
chest
or
a
cheap
little
tin
trunk
or
two
most
of
the
family
wardrobe
hangs
from
pegs
in
the
walls
or
nails
in
the
loft
beams
along
with
strings
of
dried
apples
peppers
bunches
of
herbs
twists
of
tobacco
gourds
full
of
seeds
the
hunter
pouch
and
other
odd
interesting
to
furrin
eyes
the
narrow
holds
pipes
and
snuff
and
various
other
articles
of
frequent
use
among
them
a
twig
or
two
of
sweet
birch
that
has
been
chewed
to
shreds
at
one
end
and
is
queerly
discolored
with
something
brown
this
is
what
the
mountain
woman
calls
her
tooth
brush
a
snuff
stick
understand
for
wall
decorations
there
may
be
a
few
gaudy
advertisements
lithographed
in
colors
perhaps
some
halftones
from
magazines
that
travelers
have
left
a
magazine
is
always
called
a
book
in
this
region
as
i
think
throughout
the
south
of
late
years
the
agents
for
companies
have
invaded
the
mountains
and
have
reaped
a
harvest
for
if
there
be
one
curse
of
civilization
that
our
hillsman
craves
it
is
a
huge
family
group
in
an
abominable
rococo
frame
there
is
an
almanac
in
the
cabin
but
no
clock
what
does
man
need
of
a
clock
when
he
has
a
rooster
strange
as
it
may
seem
in
this
roughest
of
backwoods
countries
i
have
never
seen
candles
unless
they
were
brought
in
by
outsiders
like
myself
beef
you
must
remember
is
exported
not
eaten
by
our
farmers
and
hence
there
is
no
tallow
to
make
candles
with
instead
of
these
every
home
is
provided
with
a
kerosene
lamp
of
narrow
wick
and
seldom
do
you
find
a
chimney
for
it
this
is
partly
because
lamp
chimneys
are
hard
to
carry
safely
over
the
mountain
roads
and
partly
because
man
can
do
without
sich
like
anyhow
but
kerosene
also
is
hard
to
transport
and
so
one
sometimes
will
find
pine
knots
used
for
illumination
but
oftener
the
woman
will
pour
hog
grease
into
a
tin
or
saucer
twist
up
a
bit
of
rag
for
the
wick
and
so
make
a
slut
that
believe
me
deserves
the
name
in
fact
the
supply
of
pine
knots
within
convenient
distance
of
home
is
soon
exhausted
and
anyway
as
the
mountaineer
disdains
to
be
forehanded
he
would
burn
up
the
knots
for
kindling
rather
than
save
any
for
illumination
very
few
cabins
have
carpet
on
the
floor
it
would
hold
too
much
mud
from
the
feet
of
the
men
who
would
not
use
a
scraper
if
there
was
one
beds
generally
are
bought
nowadays
at
the
stores
but
some
are
with
bedcords
of
bast
rope
tables
and
chairs
mostly
are
made
on
the
spot
or
obtained
by
barter
from
some
handy
neighbor
in
many
homes
you
will
still
find
the
ancient
with
a
on
the
porch
and
in
the
loft
there
will
be
a
set
of
quilting
frames
for
making
kivers
out
in
the
yard
you
see
an
ash
hopper
for
running
the
lye
to
make
soap
maybe
a
few
bee
gums
sawed
from
hollow
logs
and
a
crude
but
effective
cider
press
at
the
spring
there
is
a
box
for
cold
storage
in
summer
near
by
stands
the
great
iron
kettle
for
boiling
clothes
making
soap
scalding
pigs
and
a
variety
of
other
uses
alongside
of
it
is
the
battlin
block
on
which
the
family
wash
is
hammered
with
a
beetle
battlin
stick
if
the
woman
has
no
washboard
which
very
often
is
the
case
naturally
there
can
be
no
privacy
and
hence
no
delicacy
in
such
a
home
i
never
will
forget
my
embarrassment
about
getting
to
bed
the
first
night
i
ever
spent
in
a
cabin
where
there
was
a
family
i
did
not
know
what
was
expected
of
me
when
everybody
looked
sleepy
i
went
outdoors
and
strolled
around
in
the
moonlight
until
the
women
had
time
to
retire
on
returning
to
the
house
i
found
them
still
bolt
upright
around
the
hearth
then
the
hostess
pointed
to
the
bed
i
was
to
occupy
and
said
it
was
ready
whenever
i
was
well
i
shucked
off
my
clothes
tumbled
in
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
and
immediately
everybody
else
did
the
same
that
is
the
way
to
do
just
to
bed
i
lay
there
awake
for
a
long
time
finally
i
had
to
roll
over
a
ruddy
glow
from
the
embers
showed
the
family
in
all
postures
of
deep
healthy
slumber
it
also
showed
something
glittering
on
the
nipple
of
the
long
rifle
that
hung
over
the
father
bed
it
was
a
bright
new
percussion
cap
where
a
greased
rag
had
been
when
i
went
out
for
my
moonlight
stroll
there
was
no
need
of
a
curtain
in
that
house
they
could
do
without
i
have
been
describing
an
average
mountain
home
in
valleys
and
coves
there
are
better
ones
of
course
along
the
railroads
and
on
fertile
plateaus
between
the
blue
ridge
and
the
unakas
are
hundreds
of
fine
farms
cultivated
by
machinery
and
here
dwell
a
class
of
farmers
that
are
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
people
of
similar
station
in
the
west
but
a
prosperous
and
educated
few
are
not
the
people
when
speaking
of
southern
mountaineers
i
mean
the
mass
or
the
average
and
the
pictures
here
given
are
typical
of
that
mass
it
is
not
the
valley
people
but
the
real
mountaineers
who
are
especially
interesting
to
the
reading
public
and
they
are
interesting
because
they
preserve
traits
and
manners
that
have
been
transmitted
almost
unchanged
from
ancient
times
because
as
john
fox
puts
it
they
are
a
distinct
remnant
of
an
past
almost
everywhere
in
the
backwoods
of
appalachia
we
have
with
us
in
flesh
and
blood
the
of
our
colonial
border
aye
back
of
him
the
clansman
of
elder
britain
adapted
to
other
conditions
but
still
virtually
the
same
in
character
in
ideas
in
attitude
toward
the
outer
world
here
in
great
part
is
spoken
the
language
of
piers
the
ploughman
a
speech
long
dead
elsewhere
save
as
fragments
survive
in
some
dialects
of
rural
england
no
picture
of
mountain
life
would
be
complete
or
just
if
it
omitted
a
class
lower
than
the
average
hillsman
i
have
been
describing
as
this
is
not
a
pleasant
topic
i
shall
be
terse
hundreds
of
backwoods
families
large
ones
at
that
exist
in
blind
cabins
that
remind
one
somewhat
of
irish
hovels
norwegian
saeters
the
black
houses
of
the
hebrides
the
windowless
rock
piles
inhabited
by
corsican
shepherds
and
by
basques
of
the
pyrenees
such
a
cabin
has
but
one
room
for
all
purposes
in
rainy
or
gusty
weather
when
the
two
doors
must
be
closed
no
light
enters
the
room
save
through
cracks
in
the
wall
and
down
the
chimney
in
the
damp
climate
of
western
carolina
such
an
interior
is
fusty
or
even
wet
in
many
cases
the
chimney
is
no
more
than
a
pile
of
rough
rocks
and
rises
no
higher
than
a
man
shoulder
hence
the
common
saying
you
can
set
by
the
fire
and
spit
out
through
the
chimbly
when
the
wind
blows
contrary
one
lungs
choke
and
his
eyes
stream
from
the
smoke
illustration
a
in
some
of
these
places
you
will
find
a
pet
pig
harbored
in
the
house
i
know
of
two
cases
where
the
pig
was
kept
in
a
box
directly
under
the
table
so
that
scraps
could
be
chucked
to
him
without
rising
from
dinner
hastening
from
this
extreme
we
still
shall
find
dire
poverty
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
among
the
multitude
of
people
one
house
will
have
only
an
earthen
floor
another
will
be
so
small
that
you
cai
cuss
a
cat
in
it
gittin
in
yer
teeth
utensils
are
limited
to
a
an
iron
pot
a
a
bucket
and
some
gourds
there
is
not
enough
tableware
to
go
around
and
children
eat
out
of
their
parents
plates
or
all
together
around
one
bowl
of
stew
or
porridge
even
to
families
that
are
fairly
there
will
come
periods
of
famine
such
as
lincoln
speaking
of
his
boyhood
called
pretty
pinching
times
hickory
ashes
then
are
used
as
a
substitute
for
soda
in
biscuits
and
the
empty
will
be
soaked
for
brine
to
cook
with
once
when
i
was
boarding
with
a
good
family
our
stores
ran
out
of
everything
and
none
of
our
neighbors
had
the
least
to
spare
we
had
no
meat
of
any
kind
for
two
weeks
the
game
had
migrated
and
no
lard
or
other
grease
for
nearly
a
week
then
the
meal
and
salt
played
out
one
day
we
were
reduced
to
potatoes
straight
which
were
parboiled
in
fresh
water
and
then
burnt
a
little
on
the
surface
as
substitute
for
salt
another
day
we
had
not
a
bite
but
string
beans
boiled
in
unsalted
water
it
is
not
uncommon
in
the
far
backwoods
for
a
traveler
asking
for
a
match
to
be
told
there
is
none
in
the
house
nor
even
the
flint
and
steel
should
the
embers
on
the
hearth
go
out
someone
must
tramp
to
a
neighbor
and
fetch
fire
on
a
torch
hence
the
saying
have
you
come
to
borry
fire
that
you
in
sich
a
hurry
you
ca
chat
the
shifts
and
expedients
to
which
some
of
the
mountain
women
are
put
from
lack
of
utensils
and
vessels
are
simply
pathetic
john
fox
tells
of
a
young
preacher
who
stopped
at
a
cabin
in
georgia
to
pass
the
night
his
hostess
as
a
mark
of
unusual
distinction
killed
a
chicken
and
dressed
it
in
a
pan
she
rinsed
the
pan
and
made
up
her
dough
in
it
she
rinsed
it
again
and
went
out
and
used
it
for
a
she
came
in
rinsed
it
again
and
went
to
the
spring
and
brought
it
back
full
of
water
she
filled
up
the
glasses
on
the
table
and
gave
him
the
pan
with
the
rest
of
the
water
in
which
to
wash
his
hands
the
woman
was
not
a
slattern
it
was
the
only
utensil
she
had
such
poverty
is
exceptional
yet
it
is
an
all
but
universal
rule
that
anything
that
can
not
be
cooked
in
a
pot
or
fried
in
a
pan
must
go
begging
in
the
mountains
once
i
helped
my
hostess
to
make
kraut
we
chopped
up
a
hundred
pounds
of
cabbage
with
no
cutter
but
a
tin
holding
this
in
the
two
hands
and
chopping
downward
with
the
edge
many
times
i
stopped
to
hammer
the
edge
smooth
on
a
round
stick
verily
this
is
the
land
of
yet
however
destitute
the
mountain
people
may
be
they
are
never
abject
the
mordant
misery
of
hunger
is
borne
with
a
sardonic
grin
after
a
course
of
such
diet
as
described
above
a
woman
laughingly
said
to
me
i
gittin
the
dropsy
the
meat
is
all
droppin
off
my
bones
during
the
campaign
of
a
brother
democrat
confided
to
me
that
the
people
around
hyur
is
so
pore
that
if
free
silver
war
shipped
in
by
the
carload
could
pay
the
freight
so
when
a
settlement
is
dubbed
poverty
it
is
with
no
suggestion
of
whining
lament
but
with
the
stoical
that
shows
in
needmore
poor
fork
long
hungry
no
pone
and
no
fat
all
of
them
real
names
occasionally
as
at
time
the
poorest
live
in
abundance
occasionally
as
at
christmas
they
will
go
on
sprees
but
taking
them
the
year
through
the
highlanders
are
a
notably
abstemious
race
when
a
family
is
reduced
to
dry
corn
bread
and
black
coffee
unsweetened
so
much
and
no
more
it
will
joke
about
the
lack
of
meat
and
vegetables
and
when
there
is
meat
two
mountaineers
engaged
in
hard
outdoor
work
will
consume
less
of
it
than
a
northern
would
eat
indeed
the
heartiness
with
which
furriners
stuff
themselves
is
a
wonder
and
a
merriment
to
the
people
of
the
hills
when
a
friend
came
to
visit
me
the
landlady
giggled
an
aside
to
her
husband
git
the
almanick
and
see
when
that
feller
full
as
though
she
were
bidding
him
look
to
see
when
the
moon
would
be
full
in
truth
it
is
not
so
bad
to
be
poor
where
everyone
else
is
in
the
same
fix
one
does
not
lose
caste
nor
he
is
not
tempted
by
a
display
of
good
things
all
around
him
nor
is
he
embittered
by
the
haughtiness
and
extravagance
of
the
rich
and
socially
the
mountaineer
is
a
democrat
by
nature
equal
to
any
man
as
all
men
are
equal
before
him
even
though
hunger
be
eating
like
a
slow
acid
into
his
vitals
he
still
will
preserve
a
high
spirit
a
proud
independence
that
accepts
no
favor
unless
it
be
offered
in
a
neighborly
way
as
man
to
man
i
have
never
seen
a
mountain
beggar
never
heard
of
one
charity
or
anything
that
smells
to
him
like
charity
is
declined
with
patrician
dignity
or
open
scorn
in
the
last
house
up
hazel
creek
dwelt
old
man
stiles
he
had
a
large
family
and
was
on
the
verge
of
destitution
his
eldest
son
a
veteran
from
the
philippines
had
been
invalided
home
and
died
there
jack
coburn
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
sent
away
and
got
a
blank
form
of
application
to
the
government
for
funeral
expenses
to
which
the
family
was
entitled
by
law
he
filled
it
out
all
but
the
signature
and
rode
away
up
to
stiles
to
have
the
old
man
sign
it
but
stiles
peremptorily
refused
to
accept
from
the
nation
what
was
due
his
dead
son
i
ai
that
hard
pushed
yit
was
his
first
and
last
word
on
the
subject
this
might
seem
to
be
the
very
perversity
of
ignorance
but
it
was
in
fact
renunciation
on
a
point
of
honor
and
native
pride
refused
to
see
the
matter
in
any
other
light
the
mountaineer
born
and
bred
to
spartan
has
a
scorn
of
luxury
regarding
its
effeminacies
with
the
same
contempt
as
does
the
nomadic
arab
and
any
assumption
of
superiority
he
will
resent
with
blow
or
sarcasm
a
ragged
hobbledehoy
stood
on
the
vanderbilt
grounds
at
biltmore
mouth
open
but
silent
watching
a
gardener
at
work
the
latter
annoyed
by
the
boy
vacuous
stare
spoke
up
sharply
what
do
you
want
like
a
flash
the
lad
retorted
oh
dad
sent
me
down
hyur
to
look
at
the
place
said
if
i
liked
it
he
mought
buy
it
for
me
once
as
an
experiment
i
took
a
backwoodsman
from
the
smokies
to
knoxville
and
put
him
up
at
a
good
hotel
was
he
bashful
not
a
bit
of
it
when
the
waiter
brought
him
a
juicy
tenderloin

my
meat
raw
it
was
hard
to
find
anything
on
the
long
menu
that
he
would
eat
on
the
street
he
held
his
head
proudly
erect
and
regarded
the
crowd
with
an
expression
of
tetch
me
gin

dar
although
the
surroundings
were
as
strange
to
him
as
a
city
of
mars
would
be
to
us
he
showed
neither
concern
nor
approval
but
rather
a
fine
disdain
like
that
of
diogenes
at
the
country
fair
lord
how
many
things
there
be
in
this
world
of
which
diogenes
hath
no
need
the
poverty
of
the
mountain
people
is
naked
but
and
unashamed
to
comment
on
it
as
i
have
done
is
taken
as
an
impertinence
this
is
a
fine
trait
in
its
way
though
rather
hard
on
a
descriptive
writer
whose
motives
are
ascribed
to
mere
vulgarity
and
a
taste
for
the
people
of
course
have
no
ghost
of
an
idea
that
poverty
may
be
more
picturesque
than
luxury
and
they
are
quite
as
far
from
conceiving
that
a
plain
and
friendly
statement
of
their
actual
condition
published
to
the
world
is
the
surest
way
to
awaken
the
nation
to
consciousness
of
its
duties
toward
a
region
that
it
has
so
long
and
so
singularly
neglected
the
worst
enemies
of
the
mountain
people
are
those
public
men
who
knowing
the
true
state
of
things
yet
conceal
or
deny
the
facts
in
order
to
salve
a
sore
local
pride
encourage
the
supine
fatalism
of
what
must
be
will
be
and
so
drug
the
highlanders
back
into
their
rip
van
winkle
sleep
chapter

home
folks
and
neighbor
people
despite
the
low
standard
of
living
that
prevails
in
the
backwoods
the
average
mountain
home
is
a
happy
one
as
homes
go
there
is
little
worry
and
less
fret
nobody
nerves
are
on
edge
our
highlander
views
all
exigencies
of
life
with
the
calm
fortitude
and
tolerant
of
bret
harte
southwesterner
to
whom
cyclones
famine
drought
floods
pestilence
and
savages
were
things
to
be
accepted
and
whom
disaster
if
it
did
not
stimulate
certainly
did
not
appall
it
is
a
patriarchal
existence
the
man
of
the
house
is
lord
he
takes
no
orders
from
anybody
at
home
or
abroad
whether
he
shall
work
or
visit
or
roam
the
woods
with
dog
and
gun
is
nobody
affair
but
his
own
about
family
matters
he
consults
with
his
wife
but
in
the
end
his
word
is
law
if
madame
be
a
bit
shrewish
he
is
likely
to
tolerate
it
as
natural
to
the
weaker
vessel
but
if
she
should
go
too
far
he
checks
her
with
a
curt
shet
up
and
the
incident
is
closed
the
woman
as
every
wife
is
called
has
her
kingdom
within
the
house
and
her
man
seldom
meddles
with
its
administration
now
and
then
he
may
grumble
a
woman
allers
findin
somethin
to
do
that
a
man
ca
see
no
sense
in
but
then
the
lord
made
women
fussy
over
trifles
his
ways
are
inscrutable
so
why
bother
about
it
the
mountain
farmer
wife
is
not
only
a
household
drudge
but
a
as
well
she
helps
to
plant
hoes
corn
gathers
fodder
sometimes
even
plows
or
splits
rails
it
is
the
commonest
of
sights
for
a
woman
to
be
awkwardly
hacking
up
firewood
with
a
dull
axe
when
her
man
leaves
home
on
a
journey
he
is
not
likely
to
have
laid
in
wood
for
the
stove
or
hearth
so
she
and
the
children
must
drag
from
the
hillsides
whatever
dead
timber
they
can
find
outside
the
towns
no
hat
is
lifted
to
maid
or
wife
a
swain
would
consider
it
belittled
his
dignity
at
table
if
women
be
seated
at
all
the
dishes
are
passed
first
to
the
men
but
generally
the
wife
stands
by
and
serves
there
is
no
conscious
discourtesy
in
such
customs
but
they
betoken
an
indifference
to
woman
weakness
a
disregard
for
her
finer
nature
a
denial
of
her
proper
rank
that
are
real
and
in
the
mountaineer
to
him
she
is
little
more
than
a
sort
of
superior
domestic
animal
the
chivalric
regard
for
women
that
characterized
our
pioneers
of
the
far
west
is
altogether
lacking
in
the
habits
of
the
backwoodsman
of
appalachia
and
yet
it
is
seldom
that
a
highland
woman
complains
of
her
lot
she
knows
no
other
from
aboriginal
times
the
men
of
her
race
have
been
warriors
hunters
herdsmen
clearers
of
forests
and
their
women
have
toiled
in
the
fields
indeed
she
would
scarce
respect
her
husband
if
he
did
not
lord
it
over
her
and
cast
upon
her
the
menial
tasks
it
is
manners
for
a
woman
to
drudge
and
obey
all
respectable
wives
do
that
and
they
stay
at
home
where
they
belong
never
visiting
or
going
anywhere
without
first
asking
their
husband
consent
i
am
satisfied
that
there
is
less
bickering
in
mountain
households
than
in
the
most
advanced
society
of
christendom
certainly
there
are
fewer
divorces
in
proportion
to
the
marriages
this
is
not
by
grace
of
any
uncommon
regard
for
the
seventh
commandment
but
rather
from
a
more
tolerant
attitude
of
mind
mountain
women
marry
early
many
of
them
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
and
nearly
all
before
they
are
twenty
large
families
are
the
rule
seven
to
ten
children
being
considered
normal
and
fifteen
is
not
an
uncommon
number
but
the
infant
mortality
is
high
the
children
have
few
toys
other
than
rag
dolls
broken
bits
of
crockery
for
and
such
and
so
forth
as
they
make
for
themselves
they
play
few
games
but
rather
frisk
about
like
young
colts
without
aim
or
method
every
mountain
child
has
at
least
one
dog
for
a
playfellow
and
sometimes
a
pet
pig
is
equally
familiar
in
many
districts
there
is
not
enough
level
land
for
a
ballground
a
prime
amusement
of
the
small
boys
is
rocking
throwing
stones
at
marks
or
at
each
other
in
which
rather
doubtful
pastime
they
become
singularly
expert
to
encourage
a
child
to
do
chores
about
the
house
and
stable
he
may
be
promised
a
pig
of
his
own
the
next
time
a
sow
litters
to
know
when
to
look
for
the
pigs
an
expedient
is
practiced
that
i
never
heard
of
elsewhere
the
child
bores
a
small
hole
at
the
base
of
his
thumbnail
i
was
assured
by
a
mountain
preacher
that
the
hole
will
grow
out
to
the
edge
of
the
nail
in
three
months
and
days
the
period
he
said
of
a
sow
gestation
in
reality
the
average
term
is
about
three
months
most
mountaineers
are
indulgent
parents
the
threat
i
ye
out
with
a
is
seldom
carried
out
the
boys
especially
grow
up
with
little
restraint
beyond
their
own
natural
sense
of
filial
duty
little
children
are
allowed
to
eat
and
drink
anything
they
want
green
fruit
adulterated
candy
fresh
cider
no
matter
what
to
the
limit
of
repletion
and
fatal
consequences
are
not
rare
i
have
observed
the
very
perversity
of
license
allowed
children
similar
to
what
julian
ralph
tells
of
a
man
on
bullskin
creek
who
explaining
why
his
child
died
said
that
no
one
could
make
her
take
no
medicine
she
just
would
take
it
she
was
a
baker
through
and
through
and
you
never
could
make
a
baker
do
nothin
he
did
want
to
the
saddest
spectacle
in
the
mountains
is
the
tiny
without
a
headstone
or
headboard
in
it
all
overgrown
with
weeds
and
perhaps
unfenced
with
cattle
grazing
over
the
low
mounds
or
sunken
graves
the
spot
seems
never
to
be
visited
between
interments
i
have
remarked
elsewhere
that
most
mountaineers
are
singularly
callous
in
the
presence
of
serious
injury
or
death
they
show
a
no
less
remarkable
lack
of
reverence
for
the
dead
nothing
on
earth
can
be
more
poignantly
lonesome
than
one
of
these
mountain
nothing
so
mutely
evident
of
neglect
funeral
services
are
extremely
simple
in
the
backwoods
where
lumber
is
scarce
a
coffin
will
be
knocked
together
from
rough
planks
taken
from
someone
loft
or
out
of
puncheons
hewn
from
the
green
trees
it
is
slung
on
poles
and
carried
like
a
litter
the
only
exercises
at
the
grave
are
singing
and
praying
and
sometimes
even
those
are
omitted
as
in
case
no
preacher
can
be
summoned
in
time
in
all
back
settlements
that
i
have
visited
from
kentucky
southward
there
is
a
strange
custom
as
to
the
funeral
sermon
that
seems
to
have
no
analogue
elsewhere
it
is
not
preached
until
long
after
the
interment
maybe
a
year
or
several
years
in
some
districts
the
practice
is
to
hold
joint
services
at
the
same
time
and
place
for
all
in
the
neighborhood
who
died
within
the
year
the
time
chosen
will
be
after
the
crops
are
gathered
so
that
everybody
can
attend
in
other
places
a
husband
funeral
sermon
is
postponed
until
his
wife
dies
or
though
the
interval
may
be
many
years
these
collective
funeral
services
last
two
or
three
days
and
are
attended
by
hundreds
of
people
like
a
strange
scenes
sometimes
are
witnessed
at
the
graveside
prompted
perhaps
by
weird
superstitions
at
one
of
our
burials
which
was
attended
by
more
than
the
usual
retinue
of
kinsfolk
there
were
present
two
mothers
who
bore
each
other
the
deadliest
hate
that
women
know
each
had
a
child
at
her
breast
when
the
clods
fell
they
silently
exchanged
babies
long
enough
for
each
to
suckle
her
rival
child
was
it
a
reconciliation
cemented
by
the
very
life
of
their
blood
or
was
it
a
charm
to
keep
off
evil
spirits
no
one
could
or
would
explain
it
to
me
weddings
never
are
celebrated
in
church
but
at
the
home
of
the
bride
and
are
jolly
occasions
of
course
often
the
young
men
stimulated
with
more
or
less
moonshine
add
the
literally
stunning
compliment
of
a
shivaree
the
mountaineers
have
a
native
fondness
for
music
and
dancing
which
with
the
of
their
revivals
are
the
only
outlets
for
those
powerful
emotions
which
otherwise
they
studiously
conceal
the
harmony
of
part
singing
is
unknown
in
the
back
districts
where
men
and
women
both
sing
in
a
jerky
treble
most
of
their
music
is
in
the
weird
plaintive
minor
key
that
seems
spontaneous
with
primitive
people
throughout
the
world
not
only
the
tone
but
the
sentiment
of
their
hymns
and
ballads
is
usually
of
a
melancholy
nature
expressing
the
wrath
of
god
and
the
doom
of
sinners
or
the
luckless
adventures
of
wild
blades
and
of
maidens
all
forlorn
a
highlander
might
well
say
with
the
clown
in
winter
i
love
a
ballad
but
even
too
well
if
it
be
doleful
matter
merrily

a
very
pleasant

never

in
memorizing
the

at

the
rivalry
excited
among
the
mountain
swains
by
such
artful
lures
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
in
a
neighborhood
where

the
only
holidays
observed
in
the
mountains
outside
the
towns
are
christmas
and
new
year
christmas
is
celebrated
after
the
southern
fashion
which
seems
bizarre
indeed
to
one
witnessing
it
for
the
first
time
the
boys
and
men
having
no
firecrackers
which
they
would
disdain
anyway
go
about
shooting
revolvers
and
drinking
to
the
limit
of
capacity
or
supply
blank
cartridges
are
never
used
in
this
uproarious
jollification
and
the
courses
of
the
bullets
are
left
to
chance
so
that
discreet
people
keep
their
noses
indoors
christmas
is
a
day
of
license
of
general
indulgence
it
being
tacitly
assumed
that
punishment
is
remitted
for
any
ordinary
sins
of
the
flesh
that
may
be
committed
on
that
day
there
is
no
church
festivity
nor
are
christmas
trees
ever
set
up
few
mountain
children
hang
up
their
stockings
and
many
have
never
heard
of
santa
claus
new
year
day
is
celebrated
with
whatever
effervescence
remains
from
christmas
and
in
the
same
manner
but
generally
it
is
a
feeble
reminder
as
the
liquid
stimulus
has
run
short
and
there
are
many
sore
heads
in
the
neighborhood
most
of
the
mountain
preachers
nowadays
denounce
dances
and
as
sinful
diversions
though
their
real
objection
seems
to
be
that
such
gatherings
are
that
thin
out
the
religious
ones
be
that
as
it
may
they
certainly
have
put
a
damper
on
frolics
so
that
in
very
many
mountain
settlements
goin
to
meetin
is
recognized
primarily
as
a
social
function
and
affords
almost
the
only
chance
for
recreation
in
which
family
can
join
family
without
restraint
meetings
are
held
in
the
log
schoolhouse
the
congregation
ranges
itself
men
on
one
side
women
on
the
other
on
rude
benches
that
sometimes
have
no
backs
everybody
goes
if
one
judged
from
attendance
he
would
rate
our
highlanders
as
the
most
religious
people
in
america
this
impression
is
strengthened
in
a
stranger
by
the
grave
and
astoundingly
patient
attention
that
is
given
an
illiterate
or
nearly
illiterate
minister
while
he
holds
forth
for
two
or
three
mortal
hours
on
the
beauties
of
predestination
foreordination
immersion
or
on
the
delinquencies
of
them
critters
that
has
gone
new
light
over
in
cope
cove
after
an
lunch
everybody
doggedly
returns
to
hear
another
expound
and
denounce
at
the
top
of
his
voice
until
late
afternoon
as
long
as
the
spirit
lasts
and
he
has
good
wind
when
he
warms
up
he
throws
in
a
gasping
or
at
short
intervals
which
constitutes
the
holy
tone
doctor
macclintock
gives
this
example
oh
brethren
repent
ye
and
repent
ye
of
your
sins
ah
fer
if
ye
do
ah
the
lord
ah
he
will
grab

by
the
seat
of
yer

ah
and
held
yer
over

ye
holler
like

during

services
there

running
in
and
out
by
the
men
and
boys
most
of
whom
gradually
congregate
on
the
outside
to
whittle
gossip
drive
bargains
and
debate
among
themselves
some
point
of
dogma
that
is
too
good
to
keep
still
about
nearly
all
of
our
highlanders
from
youth
upward
show
an
amazing
fondness
for
theological
dispute
this
consists
mainly
in
capping
texts
instead
of
reasoning
with
the
purpose
of
confusing
or
downing
an
opponent
into
this
battle
of
memories
rather
than
of
wits
the
most
worthless
scapegrace
will
enter
with
keen
gusto
and
perfect
seriousness
i
have
known
two
or
three
hundred
mountain
and
to
be
whetted
to
a
fighting
edge
over
the
rocky
problem
was
saul
damned
can
a
suicide
enter
the
kingdom
of

the
mountaineers
are
intensely
universally
protestant
you
will
seldom
find
a
backwoodsman
who
knows
what
a
roman
catholic
is
as
john
fox
says
he
is
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
the
catholic
church
has
made
little
or
no
effort
to
proselyte
dislike
of
episcopalianism
is
still
strong
among
people
who
do
not
know
or
pretend
not
to
know
what
the
word
means
episcopalians
around
here
asked
a
clergyman
at
a
mountain
cabin
do
know
said
the
old
woman

skins
of

loft

you
can
find

up
thar
the
first
settlers
of
appalachia
mainly
were
presbyterians
as
became
but
they
fell
away
from
that
faith
partly
because
the
wilderness
was
too
poor
to
support
a
regular
ministry
and
partly
because
it
was
too
democratic
for
calvinism
with
its
supreme
authority
of
the
clergy
this
much
of
seventeenth
century
calvinism
the
mountaineer
retains
a
passion
for
argument
over
points
of
doctrine
and
the
cocksure
intolerance
of
john
knox
but
the
ancestral
creed
itself
has
been
forgotten
the
whether
methodist
or
baptist
found
here
a
field
ripe
for
his
harvest
being
himself
and
unassuming
he
won
easily
the
confidence
of
the
people
he
preached
a
highly
emotional
religion
that
worked
his
audience
into
the
ecstasy
that
all
primitive
people
love
and
he
introduced
a
mighty
agent
of
evangelization
among
outdoor
folk
when
he
started
the
the
season
for
is
from
to
october
the
festival
may
last
a
week
in
one
place
it
is
a
to
the
and
women
their
only
diversion
from
a
year
of
unspeakably
monotonous
toil
and
for
the
young
folks
it
is
their
theater
their
circus
their
county
fair
i
say
this
with
no
disrespect
time
is
a
gala
week
if
there
be
any
such
thing
at
all
in
the
mountains
its
attractiveness
is
full
as
much
secular
as
spiritual
to
the
great
body
of
the
people
it
is
a
camp
by
day
only
or
up
to
closing
time
no
mountaineer
owns
a
tent
preachers
and
exhorters
are
housed
nearby
and
visitors
from
all
the
country
scatter
about
with
their
friends
or
sleep
in
the
open
cooking
their
meals
by
the
wayside
in
these
backwoods
revival
meetings
we
can
witness
the
weird
phenomena
of
ungovernable
shouting
ecstasy
bodily
contortions
trance
catalepsy
and
other
results
of
hypnotic
suggestion
and
the
contagious
of
an
overwrought
crowd
this
is
called
taking
a
big
through
and
is
regarded
as
the
madness
of
supernatural
joy
it
is
a
mild
form
of
that
extraordinary
frenzy
which
swept
the
kentucky
settlements
in
when
thousands
of
men
and
women
at
the
fell
victims
to
the
jerks
barking
exercises
erotic
vagaries
physical
wreckage
or
insanity
to
which
the
frenzy
led
many
mountaineers
are
easily
carried
away
by
new
doctrines
extravagantly
presented
religious
mania
is
taken
for
inspiration
by
the
superstitious
who
are
looking
for
signs
and
wonders
at
one
time
mormon
prophets
lured
women
from
the
backwoods
of
western
carolina
and
eastern
tennessee
later
there
was
a
similar
exodus
of
people
to
the
castellites
a
sect
of
whom
it
was
commonly
remarked
that
everybody
who
joins
the
castellites
goes
crazy
in
our
day
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
holy
rollers
and
holiness
people
in
a
feud
town
of
eastern
kentucky
not
long
ago
i
saw
two
holiness
exhorters
prancing
before
a
solemnly
attentive
crowd
in
the
square
one
of
them
shouting
and
exhibiting
the
holy
laugh
while
the
other
pointed
to
the
cumberland
river
and
cried
i
do
say
i
had
the
faith
i
say
i
the
faith
to
walk
over
that
river
i
scanned
the
crowd
and
saw
nothing
but
belief
or
willingness
to
believe
on
any
countenance
of
course
most
mountaineers
are
more
intelligent
than
that
but
few
of
them
are
free
from
superstitions
of
one
kind
or
other
there
are
many
believers
in
witchcraft
among
them
though
none
own
it
to
any
but
their
intimates
and
nearly
everybody
in
the
hills
has
faith
in
portents
the
mountain
clergy
as
a
general
rule
are
hostile
to
book
larnin
for
there
ai
no
holy
ghost
in
it
one
of
them
who
had
spent
three
months
at
a
theological
school
told
president
frost
yes
the
seminary
is
a
good
place
ter
go
and
git
rested
up
but
worth
while
fer
me
ter
go
thar
no
more
long
as
i
got
good
wind
it
used
to
amuse
me
to
explain
how
i
knew
that
the
earth
was
a
sphere
but
one
day
when
i
was
busy
a
tiresome
old
preacher
put
the
everlasting
question
to
me
do
you
believe
the
yearth
is
round
an
impish
perversity
seized
me
and
i
answered
no
all
blamed
humbug
amen
cried
my
delighted
catechist
i
knowed
in
reason
you
had
more
sense
in
general
the
religion
of
the
mountaineers
has
little
influence
on
behavior
little
to
do
with
the
moral
law
salvation
is
by
faith
alone
and
not
by
works
sometimes
a
man
is
churched
for
breaking
the
sabbath
cussin
but
sins
of
the
flesh
are
rarely
punished
being
regarded
as
amiable
frailties
of
mankind
it
should
be
understood
that
the
mountaineer
morals
are
all
like
those
of
alan
breck
in
stevenson
one
of
our
nonchalantly
admitted
in
court
that
he
and
a
preacher
had
marked
a
false
which
figured
in
an
important
land
suit
on
he
was
asked
you
admit
that
you
and
preacher
x
forged
that
you
give
preacher
x
a
good
character
in
your
testimony
do
you
consider
it
consistent
with
his
profession
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
to
forge
aw
replied
the
witness
religion
ai
got
nothin
to
do
with
john
fox
relates
that
a
feud
leader
who
had
about
exterminated
the
opposing
faction
and
had
made
a
good
fortune
for
a
mountaineer
while
doing
it
for
he
kept
his
men
busy
getting
out
timber
when
they
fighting
said
to
me
in
all
seriousness
have
triumphed
agin
my
enemies
time
and
time
agin
the
lord
on
my
side
and
i
gits
a
better
and
better
christian
ever
year
a
preacher
riding
down
a
ravine
came
upon
an
old
mountaineer
hiding
in
the
bushes
with
his
rifle
are
you
doing
there
my
friend
on
stranger
was
the
easy
answer
fer
jim
johnson
and
with
the
help
of
the
lawd
i
goin
to
blow
his
damn
head
off
but
let
us
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
these
people
intellectually
are
not
living
in
our
age
to
judge
them
fairly
we
must
go
back
and
get
a
medieval
point
of
view
which
by
the
way
persisted
in
europe
and
america
until
well
into
the
georgian
period
if
history
be
too
dry
read
stevenson
and
especially
its
sequel
to
learn
what
that
viewpoint
was
the
parallel
is
so
close
eighteenth
century
britain
and
twentieth
century
appalachia
that
here
we
walk
the
same
paths
with
alan
and
david
the
edinboro
katriona
and
lady
allardyce
the
only
difference
of
moment
is
that
we
have
no
aristocracy
as
for
the
morals
of
our
highlanders
they
are
precisely
what
any
person
would
expect
after
taking
their
belatedness
into
consideration
in
speech
and
conduct
when
at
ease
among
themselves
they
are
frank
englishmen
and
scots
such
as
fielding
and
smollet
and
pepys
and
burns
have
shown
us
to
the
life
their
manners
are
boorish
of
course
judged
by
a
feminized
modern
standard
and
their
home
conversation
is
as
coarse
as
the
speeches
in
shakespeare
comedies
or
the
offhand
pleasantries
of
good
queen
bess
but
what
is
refinement
what
is
morality
i
do
mind
said
the
belovéd
vagabond
i
do
mind
the
frank
dungheap
outside
a
german
peasant
kitchen
window
but
what
i
loathe
and
abominate
is
the
dungheap
hidden
beneath
hedwige
draper
parlor
floor
and
we
do
well
to
consider
that
fine
remark
by
sir
oliver
lodge
vice
is
reversion
to
a
lower
type
perception
of
a
i
have
seen
the
worst
as
well
as
the
best
of
appalachia
there
places
on
sand
mountain
scores
of
them
where
unspeakable
orgies
prevail
at
times
but
i
know
that
between
these
two
extremes
the
great
mass
of
the
mountain
people
are
very
like
persons
of
similar
station
elsewhere
just
human
with
human
frailties
only
a
little
more
honest
i
think
in
owning
them
and
even
in
the
tenebra
of
coves
where
conditions
exist
as
gross
as
anything
to
be
found
in
the
wynds
and
closes
of
our
great
cities
there
is
this
blessed
difference
that
these
creatures
have
not
been
hopelessly
submerged
have
not
been
driven
into
desperate
war
against
society
the
worst
of
them
still
have
good
traits
strong
characters
something
responsive
to
decent
treatment
they
are
loyal
to
their
friends
quick
to
help
anyone
in
distress
they
know
nothing
of
civilization
they
are
simply
and
their
thews
are
sound
chapter
xiii
the
mountain
dialect
one
day
i
handed
a
volume
of
john
fox
stories
to
a
neighbor
and
asked
him
to
read
it
being
curious
to
learn
how
those
vivid
pictures
of
mountain
life
would
impress
one
who
was
born
and
bred
in
the
same
atmosphere
he
scanned
a
few
lines
of
the
dialogue
then
suddenly
stared
at
me
in
amazement
what
the
matter
with
it
i
asked
wondering
what
he
could
have
found
to
startle
him
at
the
very
beginning
of
a
story
why
that
feller
know
how
to
gravely
i
explained
that
dialect
must
be
spelled
as
it
is
pronounced
so
far
as
possible
or
the
life
and
savor
of
it
would
be
lost
but
it
was
of
no
use
my
friend
was
outraged
that
then
is
jest
fun
of
the
mountain
people
by
misspellin
our
talk
you
educated
folks
do
spell
your
own
words
the
way
you
say
them
a
most
palpable
hit
and
it
gave
me
a
new
point
of
view
to
the
mountaineers
themselves
their
speech
is
natural
and
proper
of
course
and
when
they
see
it
bared
to
the
spotlight
all
eyes
drawn
toward
it
by
an
orthography
that
is
as
odd
to
them
as
it
is
to
us
they
are
stirred
to
wrath
just
as
we
would
be
if
our
conversation
were
reported
by
some
josh
billings
or
artemas
ward
the
curse
of
dialect
writing
is
elision
still
no
one
can
write
it
without
using
the
apostrophe
more
than
he
likes
to
for
our
highland
speech
is
excessively
clipped
i
comin
has
a
quaintness
that
should
not
be
lost
we
can
not
visualize
the
shambling
but
eager
mountaineer
with
a
sample
of
ore
in
his
hand
unless
the
writer
reports
him
faithfully
wisht
you
this
rock
fer
me
i
heern
tell
you
was
one
o
them
although
the
hillsmen
save
some
breath
in
this
way
they
waste
a
good
deal
by
inserting
sounds
where
they
do
not
belong
sometimes
it
is
only
an
added
consonant
gyarden
acrost
corkus
caucus
sometimes
a
syllable
loaferer
musicianer
suddenty
occasionally
a
word
is
both
added
to
and
clipped
from
as
cyarn
carrion
they
are
fond
of
grace
syllables
i
got
ta
me
a
deck
o
cyards
there
ai
nary
bitty
sense
in
it
more
interesting
are
substitutions
of
one
sound
for
another
in
mountain
dialect
all
vowels
may
be
interchanged
with
others
various
sounds
of
are
confused
with
as
hed
had
kem
came
keerful
or
with
grit
grate
rifle
raffle
with
pomper
toper
taper
wrop
or
with
fur
ruther
so
any
other
vowel
may
serve
in
place
of
sarve
chist
upsot
tumble
any
other
may
displace
arn
iron
eetch
hender
whope
or
whup
the
sounds
are
more
stable
but
we
have
crap
crop
yan
clus
and
many
similar
variants
any
other
vowel
may
do
for
braysh
or
bresh
brush
shet
sich
shore
sure
mountaineers
have
peculiar
difficulty
with
diphthongs
haar
hair
cheer
chair
brile
and
a
host
of
others
the
word
coil
is
variously
pronounced
quile
querl
or
quorl
substitution
of
consonants
is
not
so
common
as
of
vowels
but
most
hillsmen
say
nabel
navel
ballet
ballad
babtis
rench
or
rinch
brickie
brittle
and
many
say
atter
or
arter
jue
due
tejus
vascinator
fascinator
a
woman
scarf
they
never
drop
nor
substitute
anything
for
it
the
word
woman
has
suffered
some
strange
most
mountaineers
pronounce
it
correctly
but
some
drop
the
others
add
an
womern
and
wimmern
while
in
michell
county
north
carolina
we
hear
the
extraordinary
forms
ummern
and
dummern
la
look
at
all
the
dummerunses
on
the
other
hand
some
words
that
most
americans
mispronounce
are
always
sounded
correctly
in
the
southern
highlands
as
dew
and
new
never
doo
noo
creek
is
always
given
its
true
sound
never
crick
nare
as
we
spell
it
in
dialect
stories
is
simply
the
right
pronunciation
of
and
nary
is
a
with
the
turned
into
a
short
sound
it
should
be
understood
that
the
dialect
varies
a
good
deal
from
place
to
place
and
even
in
the
same
neighborhood
we
rarely
hear
all
families
speaking
it
alike
outlanders
who
essay
to
write
it
are
prone
to
err
by
making
their
characters
speak
it
too
consistently
it
is
only
in
the
backwoods
or
among
old
people
and
the
women
that
the
dialect
is
used
with
any
integrity
in
railroad
towns
we
hear
little
of
it
and
farmers
who
trade
in
those
towns
adapt
their
speech
somewhat
to
the
company
they
may
be
in
the
same
man
at
different
times
may
say
ca
and
cai
set
and
sot
jest
and
jes
and
jist
atter
and
arter
or
after
seed
and
seen
here
and
hyur
and
hyar
heerd
and
heern
or
heard
sich
and
sech
took
and
tuk
there
is
no
uniformity
about
it
an
unconscious
sense
of
euphony
seems
to
govern
the
choice
of
hit
or
it
there
or
thar
since
the
appalachian
people
have
a
marked
strain
we
would
expect
their
speech
to
show
a
strong
scotch
influence
so
far
as
vocabulary
is
concerned
there
is
really
little
of
it
a
few
words
caigy
cadgy
coggled
fernent
gin
for
if
needcessity
trollop
almost
exhaust
the
list
of
distinct
scotticisms
the
as
we
call
them
were
mainly
ulstermen
and
the
ulster
dialect
of
bears
little
analogy
to
that
of
appalachia
scotch
influence
does
appear
however
in
one
vital
characteristic
of
the
pronunciation
with
few
exceptions
our
highlanders
sound
distinctly
wherever
it
occurs
though
they
never
trill
it
in
the
british
isles
this
constant
sounding
of
in
all
positions
is
peculiar
i
think
to
scotland
ireland
and
a
few
small
districts
in
the
northern
border
counties
of
england
with
us
it
is
general
practice
outside
of
new
england
and
those
parts
of
the
southern
lowlands
that
had
no
flood
of
celtic
immigration
in
the
eighteenth
century
i
have
never
heard
a
carolina
mountaineer
say
niggah
or
though
in
the
last
word
the
syllable
is
often
elided
in
some
mountain
districts
we
hear
do
door
flo
mo
yo
long
pusson
but
such
skipping
of
the
is
common
only
where
lowland
influence
has
crept
in
much
oftener
the
is
dropped
from
dare
first
girl
horse
nurse
parcel
worth
dast
fust
gal
hoss
nuss
passel
wuth
by
way
of
compensation
the
hillsmen
sometimes
insert
a
euphonic
where
it
has
no
business
just
as
many
new
englanders
say
the
idear
of
it
throughout
appalachia
such
words
as
last

vowel
sound
as
is
heard
in
man
this
helps
to
delimit
the
people
classifying
them
with
pennsylvanians
and
westerners
a
linguistic
grouping
that
will
prove
significant
when
we
come
to
study
the
origin
and
history
of
this
isolated
race
an
editor
who
had
made
one
or
two
short
trips
into
the
mountains
once
wrote
me
that
he
thought
the
average
mountaineer
vocabulary
did
not
exceed
three
hundred
words
this
may
be
a
natural
inference
if
one
spends
but
a
few
weeks
among
these
people
and
sees
them
only
under
the
prosaic
conditions
of
workaday
life
but
gain
their
intimacy
and
you
shall
find
that
even
the
illiterates
among
them
have
a
range
of
expression
that
is
truly
remarkable
i
have
myself
taken
down
from
the
lips
of
carolina
mountaineers
some
eight
hundred
dialectical
or
obsolete
words
to
say
nothing
of
the
much
greater
number
of
standard
english
terms
that
they
command
seldom
is
a
at
a
loss
for
a
word
lacking
other
means
of
expression
there
will
come
spang
from
his
mouth
a
coinage
of
his
own
instantly
he
will
create
always
from
english
roots
of
course
new
words
by
combination
or
by
turning
nouns
into
verbs
or
otherwise
interchanging
the
parts
of
speech
crudity
or
deficiency
of
the
verb
characterizes
the
speech
of
all
primitive
peoples
in
mountain
vernacular
many
words
that
serve
as

are
only
nouns
of

let
me
study

over
then
i
can
edzact
it
a
verb
so
rare
and
obsolete
that
we
find
it
in
no
american
dictionary
but
only
in
murray
a
remarkable
word
common
in
the
smokies
is
dauncy
defined
for
me
as
mincy
about
eating
which
is
to
say
fastidious
dauncy
probably
is
a
variant
of
daunch
of
which
the
new
english
cites
but
one
example
from
the
of
a
queer
term
used
by
carolina
mountaineers
without
the
faintest
notion
of
its
origin
is
doney
long
or
meaning
a
sweetheart
its
history
is
unique
british
sailors
of
the
olden
time
brought
it
to
england
from
spanish
or
italian
ports
doney
is
simply
or
a
trifle
anglicized
in
pronunciation
odd
though
that
it
should
be
preserved
in
america
by
none
but
backwoodsmen
whose
ancestors
for
two
centuries
never
saw
the
tides
in
the
vocabulary
of
the
mountaineers
i
have
detected
only
three
words
of
directly
foreign
origin
doney
is
one
another
is
kraut
which
is
the
sole
contribution
to
highland
speech
of
those
numerous
germans
mostly
pennsylvania
dutch
who
joined
the
first
settlers
in
this
region
and
whose
descendants
under
wondrously
anglicized
names
form
a
considerable
element
of
the
highland
population
the
third
is
sashiate
french
used
in
calling
figures
at
the
country
dances
there
is
something
intrinsically
stubbornly
english
in
the
nature
of
the
mountaineer
he
will
assimilate
nothing
foreign
in
the
smokies
the
eastern
band
of
cherokees
still
holds
its
ancient
capital
on
the
okona
lufty
river
and
the
whites
mingle
freely
with
these
redskins
bearing
them
no
such
despite
as
they
do
negroes
but
eating
at
the
same
table
and
admitting
indians
to
the
white
compartment
of
a
jim
crow
car
yet
the
mountain
dialect
contains
not
one
word
of
cherokee
origin
albeit
many
of
the
whites
can
speak
a
little
cherokee
in
our
county
some
indians
always
appear
at
each
term
of
court
and
an
interpreter
must
be
engaged
he
never
goes
by
that
name
but
by
the
obsolete
title
linkister
or
by
some
many
other
terms
are
preserved
in
appalachia
that
sound
delightfully
quaint
to
strangers
who
never
met
them
outside
of
books
a
married
woman
is
not
addressed
as
missis
by
the
mountaineers
but
as
mistress
when
they
speak
formally
and
as
mis
or
miz
for
a
contraction
we
will
hear
an
aged
man
referred
to
as

back
this
letter
for
me
is
a
phrase
unchanged
from
the
days
before
envelopes

an
address
had
to
be
written
on
the
back
of
the
letter
itself
can
i
borry
a
race
of
ginger
means
the
unground
root
you
will
find
the
word
in
winter
them
sorry
fellers
denotes
scabby
knaves
sorry
has
no
etymological
connection
with
sorrow
but
literally
means
covered
with
sores
and
the
highlander
sticks
to
its
original
import
we
have
in
the
mountains
many
words
to
fit
the
circumstances
of
backwoods
life
when
maize
has
passed
from
the
soft
and
milky
stage
of
but
is
not
yet
hard
enough
for
grinding
the
ears
are
grated
into
a
soft
meal
and
baked
into
delectable
pones
called
in
some
places
we
still
find
the
ancient
quern
or
jocularly
called
an
someone
who
irked
from
turning
it
invented
the
extraordinary
improvement
that
goes
by
the
name
of
this
consists
of
a
pole
pivoted
horizontally
on
top
of
a
post
and
free
to
move
up
and
down
like
the
of
an
engine
to
one
end
of
this
pole
is
attached
a
heavy
pestle
that
works
in
a
mortar
underneath
at
the
other
end
is
a
box
from
which
water
flows
from
an
elevated
spout
when
the
box
fills
it
will
go
down
lifting
the
pestle
then
the
water
spills
out
and
the

lifts

who
knows
what
a
toddick
or
taddle
is
i
did
not
until
my
friend
dargan
reported
it
from
the
nantahala
ben
did
git
a
full
turn
o
meal
but
jest
a
toddick
when
a
farmer
goes
to
one
of
our
little
mentioned
in
previous
chapters
he
leaves
a
portion
of
the
meal
as
toll
this
he
measures
out
in
a
or
toddick
or
taddle
the
name
varies
with
the
locality
which
the
left
for
that
purpose
toddick
then
is
a
small
measure
a
turn
of
meal
is
so
called
because
each
man
corn
is
ground
in
turn
he
waits
his
turn
when
one
dines
in
a
cabin
back
in
the
hills
he
will
taste
some
strange
dishes
that
go
by
still
stranger
names
beans
dried
in
the
pod
then
boiled
hull
and
all
are
called
this
is
not
slang
but
the
regular
name
green
beans
in
the
pod
are
called
snaps
when
shelled
they
are
the
old
germans
taught
their
scotch
and
english
neighbors
the
merits
of
scrapple
but
here
it
is
known
as
bread
is
made
from
biscuit
dough
with
soda
and
buttermilk
in
the
usual
way
except
that
the
shortening
is
worked
in
last
it
is
then
baked
in
flat
cakes
and
has
the
peculiar
property
of
parting
readily
into
thin
flakes
when
broken
edgewise
i
suppose
that
was
originally
and
bread
denotes
that
it
opens
into
strips
but
etymology
can
not
be
pushed
recklessly
in
the
mountains
and
i
offer
these
clews
as
a
mere
surmise
your
hostess
proffering
apple
sauce
will
ask
do
you
love
sass
i
had
to
kick
my
chum
andy
shins
the
first
time
he
faced
this
question
it
is
well
for
a
traveler
to
be
forewarned
that
the
word
love
is
commonly
used
here
in
the
sense
of
like
or
relish
if
one
is
especially
fond
of
a
certain
dish
he
declares
that
he
is
a
fool
about
it
i
a
plumb
fool
about
conversely
i
ai
much
of
a
fool
about
liver
is
rather
more
than
a
hint
of
distaste
i
et
me
a
bait
literally
means
a
mere
snack
but
jocosely
it
may
admit
a
hearty
meal
if
the
provender
be
scant
the
hostess
may
say
that
right
at
a
smidgen
meaning
little
more
than
a
mite
but
if
plenteous
then
there
are
rimptions
to
grabble
is
to
pick
from
a
hill
of
new
potatoes
a
few
of
the
best
then
smooth
back
the
soil
without
disturbing
the
immature
ones
if
the
house
be
in
disorder
it
is
said
to
be
all
gormed
or
gaumed
up
or
things
are
just
in
a
mommick
when
a
man
is
tired
he
likely
will
call
it
worried
if
in
a
hurry
he
is
in
a
swivvet
if
nervous
he
has
the
if
declining
in
health
he
is
on
the
if
he
and
his
neighbor
dislike
each
other
there
is
a
hardness
between
them
if
they
quarrel
it
is
a
ruction
a
rippit
a
jower
or
an
upscuddle
so
be
it
there
are

rather
laconic
yet
on
occasion
when
the
mountaineer
is
drawn
out
of
his
natural
reserve
and
allows
his
emotions
free
rein
there
are
few
educated
people
who
can
match
his
picturesque
and
pungent
diction
his
trick
of
apt
phrasing
is
intuitive
like
an
artist
striking
off
a
portrait
or
a
caricature
with
a
few
swift
strokes
his
characterization
is
quick
and
vivid
whether
he
use
quaint
obsolete
english
or
equally
delightful
perversions
what
he
says
will
go
straight
to
the
mark
with
epigrammatic
force
i
can
not
quit
this
topic
without
reference
to
the
bizarre
and
original
that
sprinkle
the
map
of
appalachia
many
readers
of
john
fox
novels
take
for
granted
that
the
author
coined
such
piquant
titles
as
lonesome
troublesome
hell
fer
sartin
and
kingdom
come
but
all
of
these
are
real
names
in
the
kentucky
mountains
they
denote
rough
country
and
the
country
rough
so
that
to
a
traveler
it
is
plain
enough
why
travel
and
travail
were
used
interchangeably
in
old
editions
of
shakespeare
there
is
nothing
like
knowledge
of
mountain
roads
to
revive
habits
of
thought
and
speech
the
most
scrupulous
visitor
will
fain
admit
the
aptness
of
mountain
nomenclature
kentucky
has
no
monopoly
of
grotesque
and
whimsical
local
names
the
whole
appalachian
region
from
the
virginias
to
alabama
is
peppered
with
them
whatever
else
the
southern
mountaineer
may
be
he
is
original
elsewhere
throughout
america
we
have
imported
from
the
old
world
as
thick
as

but
the
pioneers
of
the
southern
hills
either
forgot
that
there
was
an
old
world
or
they
disdained
to
borrow
from
it
personal
names

to
localities

common
enough

they
are
those

those
who
have

literally
close

nature
know
her
for
a
tyrant
void
of
pity
and
of
mercy
from
whom
nothing
can
be
wrung
without
toil
and
the
risk
of
death
to
all
pioneer
men
to
their
women
and
children
too
life
has
been
one
long
hard
cruel
war
against
elemental
powers
nothing
else
than
warlike
arts
nothing
short
of
warlike
hazards
could
have
subdued
the
beasts
and
savages
felled
the
forests
and
made
our
land
habitable
for
those
teeming
millions
who
can
exist
only
in
a
state
of
mutual
dependence
and
cultivation
the
first
lesson
of
pioneering
was
provide
with
thine
own
arm
said
the
wilderness
against
frost
and
famine
and
skulking
foes
or
thou
shalt
surely
die
but
there
were
compensations
as
the
school
of
the
woods
was
harsh
and
stern
so
it
brought
up
sons
and
daughters
of
lion
heart
and
its
reward
to
those
who
endured
was
the
most
outright
independence
to
be
had
on
earth
no
king
was
so
irresponsible
as
the
pioneer
no
czar
so
absolute
as
he
it
needed
no
martyr
spirit
in
him
to
sing
i
am
the
master
of
my
fate
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
we
have
seen
that
the
appalachian
region
was
peculiar
in
this
that
good
bottom
lands
were
few
and
far
between
so
our
mountain
farmers
were
cut
off
more
from
the
world
and
from
each
other
were
thrown
still
more
upon
their
individual
resources
than
other
pioneers
by
compulsion
their
was
more
complete
hence
their
independence
grew
more
haughty
their
individualism
more
intense
and
these
traits
exaggerated
as
they
were
by
force
of
environment
remain
unweakened
among
their
descendants
to
the
present
day
here
then
is
a
key
to
much
that
is
puzzling
in
highland
character
in
the
beginning
isolation
was
forced
upon
the
mountaineers
they
accepted
it
as
inevitable
and
bore
it
with
stoical
fortitude
until
in
time
they
came
to
love
solitude
for
its
own
sake
and
to
find
compensations
in
it
for
lack
of
society
says
a
native
writer
miss
emma
miles
in
a
clever
and
illuminating
book
on
spirit
of
the
we
who
live
so
far
apart
that
we
rarely
see
more
of
one
another
than
the
blue
smoke
of
each
chimneys
are
never
at
ease
without
the
feel
of
the
forest
on
every
side
room
to
breathe
to
expand
to
develop
as
well
as
to
hunt
and
to
wander
at
will
the
nature
of
the
mountaineer
demands
that
he
have
solitude
for
the
unhampered
growth
of
his
personality
for
his
eagle
heart
such
feeling
such
longing
most
of
us
have
experienced
in
passing
moods
but
in
the
highlander
it
is
a
permanent
state
of
mind
sustaining
him
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
to
enjoy
freedom
and
air
and
he
cheerfully
puts
aside
all
that
society
can
offer
and
stints
himself
and
bears
adversity
with
a
calm
and
steadfast
soul
to
be
free
unbeholden
lord
of
himself
and
his
surroundings
that
is
the
wine
of
life
to
a
mountaineer
such
a
man
can
not
stand
it
to
be
bossed
around
if
he
works
for
another
it
must
be
on
a
footing
of
equality
poverty
may
oblige
him
to
take
a
turn
on
some
public
works
by
which
he
means
any
job
where
many
men
work
together
such
as
lumbering
or
railroad
building
but
he
must
be
handled
with
more
respect
than
is
shown
common
laborers
elsewhere
at
a
sharp
order
or
a
curse
from
the
foreman
he
will
flare
back
enough
out
o
you
and
immediately
he
will
drop
his
tools
generally
he
will
stay
on
a
job
just
long
enough
to
earn
money
for
immediate
needs
then
back
to
the
farm
he
goes
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
mountains
every
person
is
accorded
the
consideration
that
his
own
qualities
entitle
him
to
and
no
whit
more
it
has
always
been
so
our
highlanders
have
neither
memory
nor
tradition
of
ever
having
been
herded
together
lorded
over
persecuted
or
denied
the
privileges
of
so
even
within
their
clans
there
is
no
servility
nor
any
headship
by
right
of
birth
leaders
arise
when
needed
only
by
virtue
of
acknowledged
ability
and
efficiency
in
this
respect
there
is
no
analogy
whatever
to
the
clan
system
of
ancient
scotland
to
which
the
loose
social
structure
of
our
own
highlanders
has
been
compared
we
might
expect
such

oddly
enough
crowding
only
intensifies
it
in
the

backwoodsman
neighborliness

not
grown
in
the

it
is
on

fewer

in

our
mountain
farmer
seeing
all
arable
land
taken
up
and
the
free
range
ever
narrowing
has
grown
jealous
and
distrustful
resenting
the
encroachment
of
too
many
sharers
in
what
once
he
felt
was
his
own
unfenced
domain
and
so
it
has
come
about
that
the
very
quality
that
is
his
strength
and
charm
as
a
man
his
staunch
individualism
is
proving
his
weakness
and
reproach
as
a
neighbor
and
citizen
the
virtue
of
a
time
has
become
the
vice
of
an
age
the
mountaineers
are
as
they
stand
each
man
fighting
for
his
own
hand
with
his
back
against
the
wall
they
recognize
no
social
compact
each
one
is
suspicious
of
the
other
except
as
kinsmen
or
partisans
they
can
not
pull
together
speak
to
them
of

of
interests
try
to
show
them
the
advantages
of
and
you
might
as
well
be
proffering
advice
to
the
north
star
they
will
not
work
together
zealously
even
to
improve
their
neighborhood
roads
each
mistrusting
that
the
other
may
gain
some
trifling
advantage
over
himself
or
turn
fewer

of

labor
chiefs
fail
to
organize
unions
or
granges
among

because
they
simply
will
not

the
italics
are

there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
community
of

they
are
knit
together
man
to
man
as
friends
but
not
as
a
body
of
men
our
men
are
almost
incapable
of
concerted
action
unless
they
are
needed
by
the
government
between
and
the
federal
government
no
relations
of
master
and
servant
rich
and
poor
learned
and
ignorant
employer
and
employee
are
interposed
to
bind
society
into
a
whole
mountaineers
must
awake
to
a
consciousness
of
themselves
as
a
for
although
throughout
the
highlands
of
kentucky
tennessee
and
the
carolinas
our
nature
is
one
our
hopes
our
loves
our
daily
life
the
same
we
are
yet
a
people
asleep
race
without
knowledge
of
its
own
this
condition
is
due
to
the
isolation
that
separates
the
mountaineer
from
all
the
world
but
his
own
blood
and
kin
and
to
the
consequent
utter
simplicity
of
social
relations
when
they
shall
have
established
a
unity
of
thought
corresponding
to
their
homogeneity
of
character
then
their
love
of
country
will
assume
a
practical
form
and
then
indeed
america
with
all
her
peoples
can
boast
no
stronger
sons
than
these
same
mountaineers
to
the
highlanders
of
four
states
here
mentioned
should
be
added
all
those
of
old
virginia
west
virginia
georgia
and
alabama
making
an
aggregate
of
close
on
four
million
souls
together
they
constitute
a
distinct
people
not
only
are
they
all
closely
akin
in
blood
in
speech
in
ideas
in
manners
in
ways
of
living
but
their
needs
their
problems
are
identical
throughout
this
vast
domain
there
is
no
other
ethnic
group
in
america
so
unmixed
as
these
mountaineers
and
so
segregated
from
all
others
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
they
do
not
know
it
their
isolation
is
so
complete
that
they
have
no
race
consciousness
at
all
in
this
respect
i
can
think
of
no
other
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
to
which
they
may
be
likened
as
compensation
for
the
peculiar
weakness
of
their
social
structure
the
highlanders
display
an
undying
devotion
to
family
and
kindred
mountaineers
everywhere
are
passionately
attached
to
their
homes
tear
away
from
his
native
rock
your
switzer
your
tyrolean
your
basque
your
montenegrin
and
all
alike
are
stricken
with
homesickness
beyond
speech
or
cure
at
the
first
chance
they
will
return
and
thenceforth
will
cling
to
their
patrimonies

to

domestic
affection
is
seldom
expressed
by
the
mountaineers
not
even
by
motherly
or
sisterly
kisses
but
it
is
very
deep
and
real
for
all
that
in
fact
the
ties
of
kinship
are
stronger
with
them
and
extend
to
remoter
degrees
of
consanguinity
than
with
any
other
americans
that
i
know
here
again
we
see
working
the
old
feudal
idea
an
anachronism
but
often
a
beautiful
one
in
this
bustling
commercial
age
our
hived
and
promiscuous
life
in
cities
is
breaking
down
the
old
fealty
of
kith
and
kin
god
gives
us
our
relatives
sighs
the
modern
but
thank
god
we
can
choose
our
friends
such
words
would
strike
a
mountaineer
deep
with
horror
rather
would
he
go
the
limit
of
stevenson
saint
ives
if
it
is
a
question
of
going
to
hell
go
to
hell

were

many

arose

very
slowly
in

we
still
have
clan
loyalty
outside

you
give

against
him
not
if
you
are
a

you
will
hide

out
in

carry

help
him
to
break

perjure
yourself
for

anything
everything
to
get

clear
we
see
here
a
survival
very
real
and
widespread
in
this
appalachia
of
a
condition
that
was
general
throughout
the
scotch
highlands
in
the
far
past
the
great
virtue
of
the
highlander
says
lecky
was
his
fidelity
to
his
chief
and
to
his
clan
it
took
the
place
of
patriotism
and
of
loyalty
to
his
sovereign
in
the
reign
of
james
an
insurrection
of
clan
chattan
having
been
suppressed
by
murray
two
hundred
of
the
insurgents
were
condemned
to
death
each
one
as
he
was
led
to
the
gallows
was
offered
a
pardon
if
he
would
reveal
the
of
his
chief
but
they
all
answered
that
were
they
acquainted
with
it
no
sort
of
punishment
could
induce
them
to
be
guilty
of
treachery
to
their
leader
in
the
house
of
macpherson
of
cluny
was
burnt
to
the
ground
by
the
king
troops
a
reward
of
was
offered
for
his
apprehension
a
large
body
of
soldiers
was
stationed
in
the
district
and
a
step
of
promotion
was
promised
to
any
officer
who
should
secure
him
yet
for
nine
years
the
chief
was
able
to
live
concealed
on
his
own
property
in
a
cave
which
his
clansmen
dug
for
him
during
the
night
and
though
upwards
of
one
hundred
persons
knew
of
his
place
of
retreat
no
bribe
or
menace
could
extort
the
secret
the
same
chivalrous
fidelity
to
family
and
to
clan
leader
is
still
shown
by
our
own
highlanders
as
scores
of
feuds
and
hundreds
of
criminal
trials
attest
all
this
is
openly
and
unblushingly
above
the
law
but
let
us
remember
that
the
law
itself
in
many
of
these
localities
is
but
a
feeble
dilatory
thing
that
offers
practically
no
protection
to
those
who
would
obey
its
letter
so
in
an
imperfectly
organized
society
it
is
good
to
have
that
are
faithful
unto
death
and
none
knows
it
better
than
he
who
has
missed
it
he
who
has
lived
strange
and
alone
in
some
wild
lawless
region
where
everyone
else
had
a
clan
to
back
him
so
far
as
primitive
society
is
concerned
we
may
admit
with
the
scotch
historian
henderson
that
the
clan
system
of
government
was
in
its
way
an
ideally
perfect
one
probably
the
only
perfect
one
that
has
ever
existed
the
clansman
was
not
the
subject
a
term
implying
some
sort
of
conquest
but
the
kinsman
of
his
chief
obedience
became
rather
a
privilege
than
a
task
and
no
possible
bribery
or
menace
could
shake
his
fidelity
towards
the
sassenach
or
the
members
of
clans
at
feud
with
him
he
might
act
meanly
treacherously
and
cruelly
without
check
and
without
compunction
for
there
he
recognized
no
moral
obligations
whatever
but
as
a
clansman
to
his
clan
he
was
courteous
truthful
virtuous
benevolent
with
notions
of
honor
as
punctilious
as
those
of
the
ancient
knight
the
trouble
with
clan
government
was
as
this
same
writer
has
pointed
out
that
it
was
the
very
thoroughness
of
its
adaptation
to
early
needs
that
made
it
so
hard
to
adjust
to
new
necessities
in
its
principles
and
motives
it
was
essentially
opposed
to
the
bent
of
modern
influences
its
appeal
was
to
sentiment
rather
than
to
law
or
even
reason
it
was
a
system
not
of
the
letter
but
of
the
spirit
the
clan
system
was
efficient
only
within
a
narrow
area
it
gave
rise
to
interminable
feuds
and
it
was
inapplicable
to
the
circumstances
created
by
the
rise
of
modern
industry
and
trade
everywhere
throughout
highland
dixie
we
can
observe
how
clan
loyalty
interferes
with
the
administration
of
justice
when
a
case
involving
some
strong
family
comes
up
in
the
courts
immediately
a
cloud
of
false
witnesses
arises
men
who
should
testify
on
the
other
side
are
bribed
or
run
out
of
the
country
before
subpoenas
can
be
served
and
every
juror
knows
that
his
peace
and
prosperity
in
future
depend
largely
upon
which
side
he
espouses
to
what
lengths
the
hostility
of
a
clan
may
go
in
defying
justice
was
shown
recently
in
the
massacre
of
almost
a
whole
court
by
the
allen
clan
at
hillsville
virginia
the
news
of
that
atrocity
swept
like
wildfire
throughout
all
appalachia
its
history
is
being
reviewed
in
thousands
of
mountain
cabins
and
it
is
deeply
significant
that
away
out
here
in
western
carolina
where
no
allen
blood
relationship
prejudices
men
minds
the
prevailing
judgment
of
our
backwoodsmen
is
that
the
state
of
virginia
did
wrong
in
executing
any
of
the
offenders
there
was
something
back
of
it
you
mark
my
words
say
the
country
folk
and
the
drummers
and
others
who
pass
this
way
from
southwestern
virginia
tell
us
everybody
up
our
way
sympathizes
with
the
allens
in
some
measure
this
morbid
sentiment
is
due
to
the
spectacular
features
of
the
hillsville
tragedy
if
there
be
one
human
quality
that
the
mountaineer
admires
above
all
others
it
is
nerve
and
what
greater
display
of
nerve
has
been
made
in
this
generation
than
for
a
few
clansmen
to
shoot
down
a
judge
at
the
bench
the
public
prosecutor
the
sheriff
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
two
jurymen
then
take
to
the
mountain
laurel
like
corsicans
to
the
and
defy
the
armed
power
of
the
country
the
cause
does
not
matter
to
a
mountaineer
our
highlanders
are
anything
but
robbers
for
instance
and
yet
the
only
outsider
who
has
ballads
sung
in
his
memory
throughout
appalachia
is
jesse
james
unless
jack
donohue
was
one
i
do
not
come
all
ye
bold
undaunted
men
and
outlaws
of
the
day
who
rather
wear
the
ball
and
chain
than
work
in
slavery
said
donohue
to
his
comrades
if
you
prove
true
to
me
this
day
i
fight
with
all
my
might
i
fight
for
liberty
be
of
good
courage
be
bold
and
strong
be
galliant
and
be
true
this
day
i
fight
with
all
my
might
says
bold
jack
donohue
six
policemen
he
shot
down
before
the
fatal
ball
pierced
the
heart
of
donohue
and
him
to
fall
and
then
he
closed
his
struggling
eyes
and
bid
this
world
adieu
come
all
ye
boys
that
fear
no
noise
and
pray
for
donohue
no
doubt
the
mountain
minstrels
are
already
composing
ballads
in
honor
of
the
allens
for
it
is
a
fact
we
can
not
blink
at
that
the
outlaw
is
the
popular
hero
of
appalachia
as
rob
roy
and
robin
hood
were
in
the
britain
of
long
ago
this
is
not
due
to
any
ingrained
hostility
to
law
and
order
as
such
but
simply
to
admiration
for
any
men
who
fight
desperately
against
overwhelming
odds
there
is
a
glamour
about
bold
and
lawless
adventure
that
fascinates
mature
men
and
women
who
have
never
outgrown
youthful
habits
of
mind
whoever
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
dangerous
man
to
cross
the
marked
man
who
carries
his
life
upon
his
sleeve
but
bears
himself
as
a
smiling
cavalier
he
is
the
only
true
aristocrat
among
a
valorous
but
primitive
people
but
this
is
only
half
an
explanation
the
statement
that
our
highlanders
are
not
hostile
to
law
and
order
must
be
qualified
to
this
extent
they
have
a
profound
distrust
of
the
courts
the
mountaineer
is
not
only
a
born
fighter
but
he
is
also
litigious
by
nature
and
tradition
a
stranger
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
deeply
the
average
backwoodsman
is
versed
in
the
petty
subtleties
of
legal
practice
it
comes
from
experience
draws
bigger
crowds
than
a
circus
the
mountaineer
who
has
never
served
as
juror
witness
or
principal
in
a
lawsuit
is
a
curiosity
and
this
familiarity
has
bred
secret
contempt
i
violate
no
confidence
in
saying
that
many
a
mountaineer
would
hold
up
one
hand
to
testify
his
respect
for
the
law
while
the
other
hand
hovered
over
his
pistol
why
so
just
because
his
experience
has
taught
him
rightly
or
wrongly
but
he
firmly
believes
it
that
courts
are
swayed
by
sinister
influences
when
important
matters
are
at
stake
those
influences
are
clan
money
and
clan
votes
hence
if
he
or
a
kinsman
be
involved
in
lawin
with
a
member
of
some
rival
tribe
he
does
not
look
for
impartial
treatment
but
prepares
to
fight
cunning
with
cunning
local
influence
with
local
influence
there
are
no
moral
obligations
here
all
fair
in
love
and
war
and
this
is
one
form
of
war
if
the
reader
will
take
down
his
and
read
the
intrigues
plots
and
counterplots
of
david
attorneys
and
those
of
the
crown
he
will
grasp
our
own
highlanders

the
there
may

a

fords

that

due

part
to

hard

too
mountaineers
place
a
low
valuation
on
human
life
i
need
not
go
outside
my
own
habitat
for
illustrations
in
our
judicial
district
which
comprises
the
westernmost
seven
counties
of
north
carolina
the
present
yearly
toll
of
homicides
varies
according
to
counties
from
about
one
in
to
one
in
of
the
population
and
ours
is
not
a
feud
district
nor
are
there
any
negroes
to
speak
of
compare
these
figures
with
the
rate
of
homicide
in
the
united
states
at
large
about
one
to
population
of
italy
one
to
great
britain
one
to
germany
one
to
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
no
black
hand
conspirators
or
ward
or
other
professional
criminals
figure
in
these
killings
practically
all
of
them
are
committed
by
representative
citizens
mostly
farmers
take
that
fact
home
and
think
what
it
means
remember
too
that
most
of
these
murderers
either
escape
with
light
penal
sentences
or
none
at
all
the
only
capital
sentence
imposed
in
our
district
within
the
past
ten
years
was
upon
an
indian
who
had
assaulted
and
murdered
a
white
girl
there
was
no
red
tape
or
procrastination
about
trial
the
being
filled
with
men
who
were
ready
to
lynch
him
under
the
judge
nose
if
the
sentence
were
not
satisfactory
i
said
at
the
very
outset
of
this
book
that
our
mountain
folk
still
live
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
progress
of
mankind
from
that
age
to
this
is
no
heritage
of
theirs
and
so
in
order
to
be
fair
and
just
with
these
our
backward
kinsmen
we
must
for
the
time
decivilize
ourselves
to
the
extent
of
and
getting
an
eighteenth
century
point
of
view
as
regards
the
valuation
of
human
life
what
was
that
point
of
view
the
late
professor
shaler
of
harvard
himself
a
southerner
one
time
explained
the
prevalence
of
manslaughter
among
southern
gentlemen
his
remarks
apply
with
equal
truth
to
our
mountaineers
for
they
however
poor
they
may
be
in
worldly
goods
are
by
no
means
poor
white
trash
but
rather
patricians
like
the
ragged
but
lofty
chiefs
and
clansmen
of
old
nothing
so
surprises
the
northern
people
as
the
fact
that
southern
men
of
good
estate
will
for
what
seems
to
the
distant
onlooker
trifling
matters
of
dispute
proceed
to
slay
each
other
nothing
so
gravely
offends
the
characteristic
southern
man
as
the
incapacity
of
his
brethren
of
northern
societies
to
perceive
that
such
action
is
natural
and
consistent
with
the
rules
of
gentlemanly
behavior
the
only
way
to
understand
these
differences
of
opinion
is
by
a
proper
consideration
of
the
history
of
the
moral
growth
of
these
diverse
peoples
the
southerner
has
retained
and
fostered
in
a
certain
way
reinstated
the
medieval
estimate
as
to
the
value
of
life
in
the
opinion
of
those
ages
it
was
but
lightly
esteemed
it
was
not
a
supreme
good
for
which
almost
all
else
was
to
be
sacrificed
but
something
to
be
taken
in
hand
and
put
in
risk
in
the
pursuit
of
manly
ideals
modernism
has
worked
to
intensify
the
passion
for
existence
until
those
who
are
the
most
under
its
dominion
can
not
well
conceive
how
a
man
except
for
some
supreme
duty
to
which
he
is
pledged
by
altruistic
motives
can
give
up
his
own
life
or
take
that
of
his
neighbor
if
these
people
of
will
but
perceive
that
the
characteristic
southerner
has
preserved
the
motives
of
two
centuries
ago
if
they
will
but
inform
themselves
as
to
the
state
of
mind
on
this
subject
which
prevailed
in
the
epoch
when
those
motives
were
shaped
in
men
they
will
see
that
their
judgment
is
harsh
and
unreasonable
it
is
much
as
if
they
judged
the
actions
of
englishmen
of
the
seventeenth
century
by
the
changed
standards
of
nor
will
it
be
altogether
reasonable
to
condemn
the
lack
of
regard
of
life
which
we
find
in
the
southern
gentleman
as
compared
with
his
northern
contemporary
we
must
of
course
reprobate
in
every
way
the
evil
consequences
of
this
state
of
mind
but
the
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
that
extreme
devotion
to
continued
mundane
existence
which
is
so
manifest
in
our
modern
civilization
is
certainly
open
to
debate
irrational
and
brutal
as
are
the
ways
in
which
the
gentleman
of
the
south
shows
that
his
regard
for
his
own
honor
or
that
of
his
household
outweighs
his
love
of
life
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
same
condition
existed
in
the
richest
ages
of
our
race
those
which
gave
proportionally
the
largest
share
of
ability
and
nobility
to
its
history
as
long
as
men
are
more
keenly
sensitive
to
the
opinions
of
their
fellows
than
they
are
to
the
other
goods
which
existence
brings
them
as
long
as
this
opinion
makes
personal
valor
and
truthfulness
the
jewels
of
their
lives
we
must
expect
now
and
then
to
have
degradation
of
the
essentially
noble
motives
it
is
undoubtedly
a
dangerous
state
of
mind
but
not
one
that
is
degraded
american
october
the
motives
of
two
centuries
ago
are
the
motives
of
appalachia
here
the
right
of
private
war
is
not
questioned
outside
of
a
judge
charge
from
the
bench
which
everybody
takes
as
a
mere
formality
a
convention
that
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously
the
argument
is
this
that
when
society
as
represented
by
the
state
can
not
protect
a
man
or
secure
him
his
dues
then
he
is
not
only
justified
but
in
duty
bound
to
defend
himself
or
seize
what
is
his
own
and
in
the
mountains
society
with
the
big
is
often
powerless
against
the
clan
with
a
bigger
chapter
xv
the
in
corsica
when
a
man
is
wronged
by
another
public
sentiment
requires
that
he
redress
his
own
grievance
and
that
his
family
and
friends
shall
share
the
consequences
before
the
law
made
us
citizens
great
nature
made
us
men
when
one
has
an
enemy
one
must
choose
between
the
three
s
stiletto
the
rifle
the
dagger
or
flight
there
are
two
presents
to
be
made
to
an
enemy
calda
o
ferro
hot
shot
or
cold
steel
the
corsican
code
of
honor
does
not
require
that
vengeance
be
taken
in
fair
fight
rather
should
there
be
a
sudden
thrust
of
the
knife
or
a
pistol
fired
into
the
enemy
breast
or
a
from
some
ambush
picked
in
advance
the
assassin
is
not
conscious
of
any
cowardice
in
such
act
if
the
trouble
between
him
and
his
foe
had
been
strictly
a
personal
matter
to
be
settled
forever
by
one
man
fall
then
he
might
have
welcomed
a
duel
with
all
the
punctilios
but
his
blood
is
not
his
alone
it
belongs
to
his
clan
whenever
a
corsican
is
slain
his
family
takes
up
the
feud
a
vendetta
ensues
a
war
of
extermination
by
clan
against
clan
now
the
chief
object
of
war
as
all
strategists
agree
is
to
inflict
the
greatest
loss
upon
the
enemy
with
the
least
loss
to
one
own
side
hence
we
have
hostilities
without
declaration
of
war
we
have
the
ambush
the
night
attack
masked
batteries
mines
and
submarines
thus
we
murder
hundreds
asleep
or
unshriven
this
is
war
moreover
while
a
soldier
must
be
brave
in
any
extremity
it
is
no
less
his
duty
to
save
himself
unharmed
as
long
as
he
can
so
that
he
may
help
his
own
side
and
kill
more
and
more
of
the
enemy
therefore
it
is
proper
and
military
for
him
to
snipe
his
foes
by
deliberate
sharpshooting
from
behind
any
that
he
can
find
this
is
war
and
the
vendetta
says
our
corsican
is
nothing
else
than
war
when
matteo
has
been
slain
by
an
enemy
his
friends
carry
his
body
home
and
swear
vengeance
over
the
corpse
while
his
wife
soaks
her
handkerchief
in
his
wounds
to
keep
as
a
token
whereby
she
will
incite
her
children
as
they
grow
up
to
war
against
all
kinsmen
of
their
father
murderer
then
a
son
or
brother
of
matteo
slips
forth
into
the
night
to
slay
like
a
dog
any
member
of
the
rival
faction
whom
he
may
find
at
a
disadvantage
the
deed
done
he
flies
to
the
the
mountain
thicket
and
there
he
will
hide
dodging
the
gendarmes
fighting
off
his
enemies
an
outlaw
with
a
price
upon
his
head
but
pitied
or
admired
by
all
corsicans
outside
the
feud
and
succored
by
his
clan
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
mediterranean
to
our
own
appalachia
so
why
this
prelude
our
mountaineers
never
heard
of
corsica
not
a
drop
of
south
european
blood
flows
in
their
veins
few
of
them
ever
heard
one
word
of
a
foreign
tongue
true
and
yet
we
shall
mark
some
strange
analogies
between
corsican
vendettas
and
appalachian
feuds
corsican
clannishness
and
appalachian
clannishness
corsican
women
and
our
mountain
women

long

married
a

daniel
bates
married

sister
but
separated
from
her
in
baker
charged
bates
with
undue
intimacy
with
his
wife
and
killed
him
the
whites
defending
their
kinswoman
prosecuted
the
doctor
but
he
was
acquitted
and
moved
to
cuba
afterwards
baker
returned
in
flat
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
he
was
tried
a
second
time
for
the
murder
of
bates
was
convicted
and
was
hanged
thenceforth
there
was
bad
blood
between
the
bakers
and
the
whites
involving
the
garrards
on
one
side
and
the
howards
on
the
other
as
allies
to
the
respective
clans
in
tom
baker
reputed
to
be
the
best
shot
in
the
kentucky
mountains
bought
a
note
given
by
a
howard
for
whom
he
was
cutting
timber
howard
became
furious
a
fight
ensued
one
of
the
howard
boys
and
burt
stores
were
killed
from
ambush
and
the
elder
howard
was
wounded
thereupon
jim
howard
son
of
the
clan
chief
sought
out
tom
father
who
was
county
attorney
compelled
the
unarmed
old
man
to
fall
upon
his
knees
shot
him
times
with
careful
aim
to
avoid
a
vital
spot
and
so
killed
him
by
inches
howard
was
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
but
it
is
said
that
a
pardon
was
offered
him
if
he
would
go
to
the
state
capitol
at
frankfort
and
assassinate
governor
goebel
which
he
is
charged
with
having
done
in
clay
county
where
this
feud
waged
the
judge
clerk
sheriff
and
jailer
were
of
the
white
clan
tom
baker
killed
a
brother
of
the
sheriff
and
took
to
the
hills
rather
than
give
himself
up
to
a
court
ruled
by
his
foemen
then
albert
garrard
was
fired
upon
from
ambush
while
riding
with
his
wife
to
a
religious
meeting
he
removed
to
pineville
in
another
county
under
guard
of
two
armed
men
both
of
whom
were
shot
dead
from
the
bresh

sent
state
troops
into

county
and
tom
baker
surrendered
to
them
baker
was
tried
in
the
knox
circuit
court
on
a
change
of
venue
and
was
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
life
on
appeal
his
attorneys
secured
a
reversal
of
the
verdict
and
baker
was
released
on
bail
the
new
trial
was
set
for
june
governor
bradley
again
sent
a
company
of
state
militia
with
a
gatling

to
manchester
where
the

was
to
be
held

was
put
in

surrounded
by
a

of
soldiers
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
this
tent
stood
the
unoccupied
residence
of
the
sheriff
at
the
foot
of
a
wooded
mountain
an
assassin
hidden
in
this
house
spied
upon
the
and
when
baker
appeared
shot
him
dead
with
a
rifle
then
took
to
the
woods
and
escaped
i
quote
now
from
a
history
of
this
feud
published
in
of
november
captain
john
bryan
of
the
kentucky
said
to
the
widow
of
the
murdered
tom
baker
after
they
returned
from
the
funeral
baker
why
do
you
leave
this
miserable
country
and
escape
from
these
terrible
feuds
move
away
and
teach
your
children
to
forget
bryan
said
the
widow
and
she
spoke
evenly
and
quietly
have
twelve
sons
it
will
be
the
chief
aim
of
my
life
to
bring
them
up
to
avenge
their
father
death
each
day
i
shall
show
my
boys
handkerchief
stained
with
his
and
tell
them
who
murdered
him
corsican
vendetta
or
kentucky
feud
what
are
language
and
race
against
isolation
and
an
environment
that
keeps
humanity
feral
to
the
core
shortly
after
baker
death
four
griffins
of
the
faction
ambushed
big
john
philpotts
and
his
cousin
wounding
the
former
severely
and
the
latter
mortally
big
john
fought
them
from
behind
a
log
and
killed
all
four
on
july
four
of
the
philpotts
were
attacked
by
four
morrises
of
the
howard
side
three
men
were
killed
three
mortally
wounded
and
the
other
two
were
severely
injured
no
arrests
were
made
finally
in
the
two
clans
fought
a
pitched
battle
in
front
of
the
in
manchester
at
its
conclusion
they
formally
signed
a
truce
this
is
a
mere
scenario
of
a
feud
in
the
wealthiest
and
county
of
eastern
kentucky
two
of
the
families
involved
were
of
distinguished
lineage
counting
in
their
ranks
a
governor
three
generals
a
member
of
congress
and
a
prohibition
candidate
for
the
presidency
in
reviewing
this
feud
governor
bradley
stated
the
whole
fault
in
clay
county
is
a
vitiated
public
sentiment
and
a
failure
of
the
civil
authorities
to
do
their
duty
the
laws
are
insufficient
for
the
governor
to
apply
a
remedy
such
feuds
have
been
in
progress
more
or
less
for
years
and
no
governor
of
the
state
has
ever
been
able
to
quell
them
they
have
terminated
only
when
their
force
was
spent
by
one
side
or
the
other
being
killed
or
moving
out
of
the
country
the
laws
are
insufficient
for
the
governor
to
apply
a
remedy
one
naturally
asks
how
so
the
answer
is
that
the
governor
can
not
send
troops
into
a
county
except
upon
request
of
the
civil
authorities
and
they
must
go
as
a
posse
to
civil
officers
in
most
feuds
these
officers
are
partisans
in
fact
it
is
a
favorite
ruse
for
one
clan
to
win
or
usurp
the
county
offices
before
making
war
hence
the
state
troops
would
only
serve
as
a
reinforcement
to
one
of
the
contending
factions
to
show
how
this
works
out
we
will
sketch
briefly
the
course
of
another
in
rowan
county
kentucky
in
there
was
an
election
quarrel
between
two
members
of
the
martin
and
toliver
families
the
logans
sided
with
the
martins
and
the
youngs
with
the
tolivers
the
faction
elected
their
candidate
for
sheriff
by
a
margin
of
twelve
votes
then
there
was
an
affray
in
which
one
logan
was
killed
and
three
were
wounded
as
usual
in
feuds
no
immediate
redress
was
attempted
but
the
injured
clan
plotted
its
vengeance
with
deadly
deliberation
after
five
months
dick
martin
killed
floyd
toliver
his
own
people
worked
the
trick
of
arresting
him
themselves
and
sent
him
to
winchester
for
the
tolivers
succeeded
in
having
him
brought
back
on
a
forged
order
and
killed
him
when
he
was
bound
and
helpless
the
leader
of
the
faction
was
a
notorious
bravo
named
craig
toliver
to
strengthen
his
power
he
became
candidate
for
town
marshal
of
morehead
and
he
won
the
office
by
intimidation
at
the
polls
then
for
two
years
a
bushwhacking
war
went
on
three
times
the
governor
sent
troops
into
rowan
county
but
each
time
they
found
nothing
but
creeks
and
thickets
to
fight
then
he
prevailed
upon
the
clans
to
sign
a
truce
and
expatriate
their
chiefs
for
one
year
in
distant
states
craig
toliver
obeyed
the
order
by
going
to
missouri
but
returned
several
months
before
the
expiration
of
his
term
and
renewed
his
atrocities
in
the
warfare
that
ensued
all
the
county
officers
were
involved
from
the
judge
down
in
proctor
knott
governor
of
kentucky
said
in
his
message
of
the
feud
though
composed
of
only
a
small
portion
of
the
community
these
factions
have
succeeded
by
their
violence
in
overawing
and
silencing
the
voice
of
the
peaceful
element
and
in
intimidating
the
officers
of
the
law
having
their
origin
partly
in
party
rancor
they
have
ceased
to
have
any
political
significance
and
have
become
contests
of
personal
ambition
and
revenge
each
party
seeking
apparently
to
possess
itself
of
the
machinery
of
justice
in
order
that
it
may
under
the
forms
of
law
seek
the
gratification
of
personal
animosities
during
the
present
year
the
local
leader
of
one
of
these
factions
came
in
possession
of
the
office
of
police
judge
of
the
town
of
morehead
under
color
of
the
authority
of
that
office
and
sustained
by
an
armed
band
of
adherents
he
exercised
despotic
sway
over
the
town
and
its
vicinage
he
banished
citizens
who
were
obnoxious
to
him
and
in
one
instance
after
arresting
two
citizens
who
seem
to
have
been
guilty
of
no
offense
he
and
his
party
attended
by
a
deputy
sheriff
of
the
county
murdered
them
in
cold
blood
this
act
of
atrocity
fully
aroused
the
community
a
posse
acting
under
the
authority
of
a
warrant
from
the
county
judge
attacked
the
police
judge
and
his
adherents
on
the
of
june
last
killed
several
of
their
number
and
put
the
rest
to
flight
and
temporarily
restored
something
like
tranquility
to
the
community
the
proceedings
of
the
circuit
court
which
was
held
in
august
were
not
calculated
to
inspire
the
citizens
with
confidence
in
securing
justice
the
report
of
the
adjutant
general
on
this
subject
shows
from
information
derived
representative
men
without
reference
to
party
affiliations
that
the
judge
of
the
circuit
court
seems
so
far
under
the
influence
of
the
reputed
leader
of
one
of
the
factions
as
to
permit
such
an
organization
of
the
grand
juries
as
will
effectually
prevent
the
indictment
of
members
of
that
faction
for
the
most
flagrant
crimes
the
posse
here
mentioned
was
organized
by
daniel
boone
logan
a
cousin
of
the
two
young
men
who
had
been
murdered
a
college
graduate
and
a
lawyer
of
good
standing
with
the
assent
of
the
governor
he
gathered
fifty
to
picked
men
and
armed
them
with
the
best
modern
rifles
and
revolvers
some
of
the
men
were
of
his
own
clan
others
he
hired
his
plan
was
to
end
the
war
by
exterminating

by
the
posse
boone
logan
was
indicted
for
murder
at
the
trial
he
admitted
the
killings
but
he
showed
that
the
feud
had
cost
the
lives
of
not
less
than
men
that
not
one
person
had
been
legally
punished
for
these
murders
and
that
he
had
acted
for
the
good
of
the
public
in
ending
this
infamous
struggle
the
court
accepted
this
view
of
the
case
the
community
sustained
it
and
the
war
was
closed
a
feud
in
the
restricted
sense
here
used
is
an
armed
conflict
between
families
each
endeavoring
to
exterminate
or
drive
out
the
other
it
spreads
swiftly
not
only
to
and
relatives
by
marriage
but
to
friends
and
retainers
as
well
it
may
lie
dormant
for
a
time
perhaps
for
a
generation
and
then
burst
forth
with
recruited
strength
long
after
its
original
cause
has
ceased
to
interest
anyone
or
maybe
after
it
has
been
forgotten
such
feuds
are
by
no
means
prevalent
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
appalachia
but
are
restricted
mostly
to
certain
well
defined
districts
of
which
the
chief
in
extent
of
territory
as
well
as
in
the
number
and
ferocity
of
its
wars
is
the
country
round
the
upper
waters
of
the
kentucky
licking
big
sandy
tug
and
cumberland
rivers
embracing
many
of
the
mountain
counties
of
eastern
kentucky
and
adjoining
parts
of
west
virginia
old
virginia
and
tennessee
in
this
thinly
settled
region
probably
five
hundred
men
have
been
slain
in
feuds
since
our
centennial
year
and
only
three
of
the
murderers
so
far
as
i
know
have
been
executed
by
law
the
active
feudists
as
a
rule
include
only
a
small
part
of
the
community
but
public
sentiment
in
feud
districts
approves
or
at
least
tolerates
the
vendetta
just
as
it
does
in
corsica
or
the
balkans
those
citizens
who
are
not
directly
implicated
take
pains
to
hear
little
and
see
less
they
keep
their
mouths
shut
they
can
neither
be
persuaded
bribed
nor
coerced
into
informing
or
testifying
against
either
side
but
on
the
contrary
will
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
an
investigator
or
try
to
stare
him
down
a
jury
composed
of
such
men
will
not
convict
anybody
when
a
feud
is
raging
nobody
outside
the
warring
clans
is
in
any
danger
at
all
a
stranger
is
safer
in
the
heart
of
feuddom
than
he
would
be
in
chicago
or
new
york
so
long
as
he
attends
strictly
to
his
own
business
asks
no
questions
and
tells
no
tales
if
on
the
contrary
he
should
express
horror
or
curiosity
he
is
regarded
as
a
busybody
or
suspected
as
a
spy
and
is
likely
to
be
run
out
of
the
country
or
even
laywayed
and
silenced
forever
what
causes
feuds
some
of
them
start
in
mere
drunken
rows
or
in
a
dispute
over
a
game
of
cards
others
in
quarrels
over
land
boundaries
or
other
property
the
feud
started
because
randolph
mccoy
penned
up
two
wild
hogs
that
were
claimed
by
floyd
hatfield
the
spite
over
these
hogs
broke
out
two
years
later
and
one
partisan
was
killed
from
ambush
the
feud
itself
began
in
over
a
debt
of
with
the
hogs
and
the
bushwhacking
brought
up
in
recrimination
love
of
women
is
the
primary
cause
or
the
secondary
aggravation
of
many
a
feud
some
of
the
most
widespread
and
deadliest
vendettas
have
originated
in
political
strifes
it
should
be
understood
that
national
and
state
politics
cut
little
or
no
figure
in
these
wars
local
politics
in
most
of
the
mountain
counties
is
merely
a
factional
fight
in
which
family
matters
and
business
interests
are
involved
and
the
contest
becomes
bitterly
personal
on
that
account
this
explains
most
of
the
collusion
or
partisanship
of
county
officers
and
their
remissness
in
enforcing
the
law
in
murder
cases
family
ties
or
political
alliances
override
even
the
oath
of
office
within
the
past
year
i
have
heard
a
deputy
sheriff
admit
nonchalantly
on
the
stand
that
when
a
homicide
was
committed
near
him
and
he
was
the
only
officer
in
the
vicinity
he
advised
the
slayer
to
take
to
the
mountains
and
hide
out
the
judge
questioned
him
sharply
on
this
point
was
reassured
by
the
witness
that
it
was
so
and
then
offered
no
comment
at
all
within
the
same
period
in
another
but
not
distant
court
a
desperado
from
the
shelton
laurel
on
trial
for
murder
admitted
that
he
had
shot
six
men
since
he
moved
over
from
tennessee
to
north
carolina
and
swore
that
while
he
was
being
held
in
jail
pending
trial
for
this
last
offense
the
sheriff
permitted
him
to
keep
a
gun
in
his
cell
drink
whiskey
in
the
jail
and
eat
at
table
with
the
family
of
the
sheriff
feuds
spread
not
only
through
clan
fealty
but
also
because
they
offer
excellent
chances
to
pay
off
old
scores
the
mountaineer
has
a
long
memory
the
average
highlander
is
fiery
and
combative
by
nature
but
at
the
same
time
cunning
and
vindictive
if
publicly
insulted
he
will
strike
at
once
but
if
he
feels
wronged
by
some
act
that
does
not
demand
instant
retaliation
he
will
brood
over
it
and
plot
patiently
to
get
his
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
some
mountaineers
always
fight
fair
but
many
of
them
prefer
to
wait
and
watch
quietly
until
the
foe
gets
drunk
and
unwary
or
until
he
is
engaged
in
some
illegal
or
scandalous
act
or
until
he
is
known
to
be
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
whereupon
he
can
be
shot
down
unexpectedly
and
his
assailant
can
prove
by
friendly
witnesses
that
he
acted
in
so
if
a
man
be
involved
in
feud
he
may
be
assassinated
from
ambush
by
someone
who
is
not
concerned
in
the
clan
trouble
but
who
has
hated
him
for
years
on
another
account
and
who
knows
that
his
death
now
will
be
charged
up
to
the
opposing
faction
from
the
earliest
times
it
has
been
customary
for
our
highlanders
to
go
armed
most
of
the
time
this
was
a
necessity
in
the
old
days
and
throughout
the
kukluxing
and
era
following
the
civil
war
such
a
habit
once
formed
is
hard
to
eradicate
even
in
all
parts
of
appalachia
that
i
am
familiar
with
most
of
the
young
men
i
judge
and
many
of
the
older
ones
carry
concealed
weapons
among
them
i
have
never
seen
a
and
fight
according
to
the
rules
of
the
ring
they
have
many
brawls
in
which
they
slug
wrestle
kick
bite
strangle
until
one
gets
the
other
down
whereat
the
one
on
top
continues
to
maul
his
victim
until
he
cries
enough
oftener
a
club
or
stone
will
be
used
in
mad
endeavor
to
knock
the
opponent
senseless
at
a
blow
there
is
no
compunction
about
striking
foul
and
very
little
about
let
us
pause
long
enough
to
admit
that
this
was
the
british
and
american
way
of
universal
among
the
common
people
until
well
into
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
mountaineers
are
still
ignorant
of
any
other
except
fighting
with
weapons
many
of
the
young
men
carry
billies
or
brass
knucks
every
man
and
boy
has
at
least
a
with
serviceable
blade
fights
with
such
crude
weapons
are
frequent
there
are
few
spectacles
more
sickening
than
two
powerful
but
awkward
men
slashing
each
other
with
common
though
the
fatalities
are
much
less
frequent
than
in
i
have
known
two
old
mountain
preachers
to
draw
knives
on
each
other
at
the
close
of
a
sermon
the
typical
highland
bravo
always
carries
a
revolver
or
an
automatic
pistol
this
is
likely
to
be
a
weapon
of
large
bore
and
good
that
is
worn
in
a
concealed
under
the
coat
or
vest
or
shirt
most
mountaineers
are
good
shots
with
such
arms
though
not
so
deadly
quick
as
the
frontiersmen
of
our
west
in
fact
they
can
not
be
so
quick
without
wearing
the
weapon
exposed
when
a
highlander
has
time
he
prefers
to
hold
his
pistol
in
both
hands
left
clasped
over
right
and
aims
it
as
he
would
a
rifle
to
a
westerner
such
gun
practice
looks
absurd
but
it
is
accurate
beyond
question
few
mountain
fail
to
score
at
least
one
victim
the
average
mountain
woman
is
as
combative
in
spirit
as
her
menfolk
she
would
despise
any
man
who
took
insult
or
injury
without
showing
fight
in
fact
the
woman
in
many
cases
deliberately
stirs
up
trouble
out
of
vanity
or
for
the
sheer
excitement
of
it
some
of
the
older
women
display
the
ferocity
of
the
mother
of
a
large
family
said
in
my
presence
with
the
calm
earnestness
of
one
fully
experienced
if
a
feller
treated
me
the
way
did
i
git
me
a
and
shoot
enough
meat
off
o
his
bones
to
feed
a
a
week
three
of
this
woman
brothers
had
been
shot
dead
in
frays
one
of
them
killed
the
first
husband
of
her
sister
who
married
again
and
whose
second
husband
was
killed
by
a
man
with
whom
she
then
tried
a
third
matrimonial
venture
such
matters
may
not
be
interesting
in
themselves
but
they
give
one
pause
when
he
learns
in
addition
that
these
people
are
received
as
friends
and
on
a
footing
of
equality
by
everybody
in
their
community
that
the
mountaineers
are
fierce
and
relentless
in
their
feuds
is
beyond
denial
a
warfare
of
bushwhacking
and
assassination
knows
no
refinements
quarter
is
neither
given
nor
expected
property
however
is
not
violated
and
women
are
not
often
injured
there
have
been
some
atrocious
exceptions
in
the
feud
cap
hatfield
and
tom
wallace
attacked
the
latter
wife
and
her
mother
at
night
dragged
both
women
from
bed
and
cap
beat
the
old
woman
with
a
cow
tail
that
he
had
clipped
off
jes
to
see
jump
he
broke
two
of
the
woman
ribs
leaving
her
injured
for
life
while
tom
beat
his
wife
later
on
new
year
night
a
gang
of
the
hatfields
surrounded
the
home
of
randolph
mccoy
killed
the
eldest
daughter
allaphare
broke
her
mother
ribs
and
knocked
her
senseless
with
their
guns
and
killed
a
son
calvin
in
several
instances
women
who
fought
in
defense
of
their
homes
have
been
killed
as
in
the
case
of
charles
daniels
and
her
daughter
in
pike
county
kentucky
in
november
the
mountain
women
do
not
shrink
from
feuds
but
on
the
contrary
excite
and
cheer
their
men
to
desperate
deeds
and
sometimes
fight
by
their
side
in
the
feud
a
woman
learning
that
her
unarmed
husband
was
besieged
by
his
foes
seized
his
rifle
filled
her
apron
with
cartridges
rushed
past
the
and
stood
by
her
old
man
until
he
beat
his
assailants
off
when
men
are
hiding
out
in
the
laurel
it
is
the
women
part
which
they
never
shirk
to
carry
them
food
and
information
in
every
feud
each
clan
has
a
leader
a
man
of
prominence
either
on
account
of
his
wealth
or
his
political
influence
or
his
shrewdness
or
his
physical
prowess
this
leader
orders
are
obeyed
while
hostilities
last
with
the
same
unquestioning
loyalty
that
the
old
scotch
retainer
showed
to
his
chieftain
either
the
leader
or
someone
acting
for
him
supplies
the
men
with
food
with
weapons
if
they
need
them
with
ammunition
and
with
money
sometimes
mercenaries
are
hired
fox
says
that
in
one
local
war
i
remember
four
dollars
per
day
were
the
wages
of
the
fighting
man
and
the
leader
on
one
occasion
while
besieging
his
enemies
in
the
county
tried
to
purchase
a
cannon
and
from
no
other
place
than
the
state
arsenal
and
from
no
other
personage
than
the
governor
himself
in
some
of
the
feuds
professional
bravos
have
been
employed
who
would
assassinate
for
a
few
dollars
anybody
who
was
pointed
out
to
them
provided
he
was
alien
to
their
own
clans
the
character
of
the
highland
bravo
is
precisely
that
of
the
western
bad
man
as
pictured
by
jed
parker
in
stewart
edward
white
a
good
deal
of
romance
been
written
about
the
bad
man
and
there
about
the
same
amount
of
nonsense
the
bad
man
is
just
a
plain
murderer
neither
more
nor
less
he
never
does
get
into
a
real
good
plain
if
he
can
possibly
help
it
his
killin
are
done
from
behind
a
door
or
when
he
got
his
man
dead
to
rights
there
sam
cook
you
all
heard
of
him
he
had
nerve
of
course
and
when
he
was
backed
into
a
corner
he
made
good
and
he
was
sure
sudden
death
with
a
gun
but
when
he
went
out
for
a
man
deliberate
he
did
take
no
special
chances
point
is
that
these
yere
bad
men
are
a
miserable
proposition

there
ai
no
romance
about
that
and
there
is
no
romance
about
a
real
mountain
feud
it
is
marked
by
suave
treachery
laywaying
and
general
heartlessness
and
brutality
if
one
side
refuses
to
assassinate
but
seeks
open
honorable
combat
as
has
happened
in
several
feuds
it
is
sure
to
be
beaten
whoever
appeals
to
the
law
is
sure
to
be
beaten
in
either
case
he
is
considered
a
fool
or
a
coward
by
most
of
the
countryside
our
highlander
untouched
by
the
culture
of
the
world
about
him
has
never
been
taught
the
meaning
of
fair
play
magnanimity
to
a
fallen
foe
he
would
regard
as
sure
proof
of
an
addled
brain
the
motive
of
one
who
forgives
his
enemy
is
utterly
beyond
his
comprehension
as
for
bushwhacking
hit
as
for
one
as
is

squar
who
shoot

man
ca
fight
money
in

in
this
he
is
simply
his
ancient
scotch
or
english
ancestor
born
over
again
such
was
the
code
of
jacobite
scotland
and
tudor
england
and
is
where
our
mountaineer
belongs
in
the
scale
of
human
evolution
the
feud
as
miss
miles
puts
it
is
an
outbreak
of
family
affection
its
mainspring
is
an
honorable
clan
loyalty
it
is
a
direct
consequence
of
the
clan
organization
that
our
mountaineers
preserve
as
it
was
handed
down
to
them
by
their
forefathers
the
implacability
of
their
vengeance
the
treacheries
they
practice
the
murders
from
ambush
are
invariable
features
of
clan
warfare
wherever
and
by
whomsoever
it
is
waged
they
are
not
vices
or
crimes
peculiar
to
the
kentuckian
or
the
corsican
or
the
sicilian
or
the
albanian
or
the
arab
but
natural
results
of
clan
government
which
in
turn
is
a
result
of
isolation
of
physical
environment
of
geographical
position
unfavorable
to
free
intercourse
and
commerce
with
the
world
at
large
the
most
hideous
feature
of
the
feud
is
the
shooting
down
of
unarmed
or
unwarned
men
assassination
in
our
modern
eyes
is
the
last
and
lowest
infamy
of
a
coward
such
it
truly
is
when
committed
in
the
civilized
society
of
our
day
but
in
studying
primitive
races
or
in
going
back
along
the
line
of
our
own
ancestry
to
the
civilized
society
of
two
centuries
ago
we
must
face
and
acknowledge
the
strange
paradox
of
a
valorous
and
honorable
people
according
to
their
lights
who
in
certain
cases
practiced
assassination
without
compunction
and
in
fact
with
pride
history
is
red
with
it
in
those
very
richest
ages
of
our
race
that
professor
shaler
cited
until
a
century
or
two
ago
throughout
christendom
the
secret
murder
of
enemies
was
committed
unblushingly
by
nobles
and
kings
and
prelates
often
with
a
pious
thus
sayeth
the
lord
it
was
practiced
by
men
valiant
in
open
battle
and
by
those
wise
in
the
counsels
of
the
realm
take
scotland
for
example
as
pictured
by
a
native
no
tenet
nor
practice
no
influence
nor
power
nor
principality
in
the
scotland
of
the
past
has
outvied
assassination
in
ascendancy
or
in
moment
not
theoretically
indeed
but
practically
it
occupied
for
centuries
a
distinct
almost
a
supreme
place
in
her
political
constitution
was
in
fact
the
understood
if
not
recognized
expedient
always
in
reserve
should
other
milder
and
more
hallowed
methods
fail
of
accomplishing
the
desired
political
or
it
might
be
religious
consummation
for
centuries
such
justice
as
was
exercised
was
haphazard
and
rude
and
practically
there
was
no
law
but
the
will
of
the
stronger
few
if
any
of
the
great
families
but
had
their
special
feud
and
feuds
once
originated
survived
for
ages
to
forget
them
would
have
been
treason
to
the
dead
and
wild
purposes
of
revenge
were
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
as
a
sacred
legacy
to
take
an
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
was
not
deemed
mean
and
contemptible
but
all
the
arts
in
which
the
wise
excel
nature
chief
masterpiece
to
do
it
boldly
and
adroitly
was
to
win
a
peculiar
halo
of
renown
and
thus
assassination
ceased
to
be
the
weapon
of
the
avowed
desperado
and
came
to
be
wielded
unblushingly
not
only
by
men
of
honor
but
by
the
religious
as
well
a
noble
did
not
scruple
to
use
it
against
his
king
and
the
king
himself
felt
no
dishonor
in
resorting
to
it
against
a
dangerous
noble
james
was
hacked
to
death
in
the
night
by
sir
robert

and
james

himself
of
the
imperious
and
intriguing

by
suddenly
stabbing
him
while
within
his
own
royal
palace
under
protection
of
a
safe
conduct
the
leaders
of
the
reformation
discerned
in
assassination
that
of
their
enemies
the
special
and
judgment
of
when
the
assassination
of
cardinal
beaton
took
place
in
all
the
savage
details
of
it
were
set
down
by
knox
with
unbridled
gusto

is
his

ingenuous
comment
on
his
performance
the
burden
of
george

is
the
lawfulness
or
righteousness
of
the
removal
by
assassination
or
any
other
fitting
or
convenient
means
of
incompetent
kings
whether
heinously
wicked
and
tyrannical
or
merely

and
weak
of

and
he
cites
as
a
case
in

and
an
in

murder
of

which
if
it
were
only
on
account
of
the

hideous
travesty
of
the
last

of

would
deserve
to
be
held
in
unique
and
everlasting
detestation
henderson
yet
the
scots
have
always
been
a
notably
warlike
and
fearless
race
so
too
are
our
southern
mountaineers
in
the
civil
war
and
the
spanish
war
they
sent
a
larger
proportion
of
their
men
into
the
service
than
almost
any
other
section
of
our
country
let
us
not
overlook
the
fact
that
it
demands
courage
of
a
high
order
for
one
to
stay
in
a
district
conscious
of
being
marked
for
slaughter
stay
there
month
in
and
month
out
year
in
and
year
out
not
knowing
at
what
moment
he
may
be
beset
by
overpowering
numbers
from
what
laurel
thicket
he
may
be
shot
or
at
what
hour
of
the
night
he
may
be
called
to
his
door
and
struck
dead
before
his
family
on
the
credit
side
of
their
valor
then
be
it
entered
that
few
mountaineers
will
shrink
from
such
ordeal
when
even
from
no
fault
of
their
own
it
is
thrust
upon
them
the
is
simply
a
horrible
survival
of
medievalism
it
is
the
highlander
misfortune
to
be
stranded
far
out
of
the
course
of
civilization
he
is
no
worse
than
that
bygone
age
that
he
really
belongs
to
in
some
ways
he
is
better
he
is
far
less
cruel
than
his
ancestors
were
than
our
ancestors
were
he
does
not
torture
with
the
tumbril
the
stocks
the
the
pillory
the
the
and
and
that
were
in
everyday
use
under
the
old
criminal
code
he
does
not
tie
a
woman
to
the
tail
and
publicly
lash
her
bare
back
until
it
streams
with
blood
nor
does
he
hang
a
man
for
picking
somebody
pocket
of
twelve
pence
and
a
farthing
he
does
not
go
slumming
in
bedlam
paying
tuppence
for
the
sport
of
mocking
the
maniacs
until
they
rattle
their
chains
in
rage
or
horror
he
does
not
turn
executions
of
criminals
into
public
festivals
he
never
has
been
known
to
burn
a
condemned
one
at
the
stake
if
he
hangs
a
man
he
does
not
first
draw
his
entrails
and
burn
them
before
his
eyes
with
a
mob
crowding
about
to
jeer
the
poor
devil
flinching
or
to
compliment
him
on
his
nerve
yet
all
these
pleasantries
were
proper
and
legal
in
christian
britain
two
centuries
ago
this
isolated
and
belated
people
who
still
carry
on
the
are
not
half
so
much
to
blame
for
such
a
savage
survival
as
the
rich
powerful
educated
nation
that
abandons
them
as
if
they
were
hopelessly
derelict
or
wrecked
it
took
but
a
few
decades
to
civilize
scotland
how
much
swifter
and
surer
and
easier
are
our
means
of
enlightenment
let
us
not
forget
that
these
highlanders
are
blood
of
our
blood
and
bone
of
our
bone
for
they
are
americans
to
a
man
proud
of
their
nationality
and
passionately
loyal
to
the
flag

they
more
than
any
other
of

according
to
their
strength

fought
and

who
are
the
mountaineers
the
southern
appalachian
mountains
happen
to
be
parceled
out
among
eight
different
states
and
for
that
reason
they
are
seldom
considered
as
a
geographical
unit
in
the
same
way
their
inhabitants
are
thought
of
as
kentucky
mountaineers
or
carolina
mountaineers
and
so
on
but
not
often
as
a
body
of
appalachian
mountaineers
and
yet
these
inhabitants
are
as
distinct
an
ethnographic
group
as
the
mountains
themselves
are
a
geographic
group
the
mountaineers
are
homogeneous
so
far
as
speech
and
manners
and
experiences
and
ideals
can
make
them
in
the
aggregate
they
are
nearly
twice
as
numerous
and
cover
twice
as
much
territory
as
any
one
of
the
states
among
which
they
have
been
distributed
but
in
each
of
these
states
they
occupy
only
the
backyard
and
generally
take
back
seats
in
the
councils
of
the
commonwealth
they
have
been
fenced
off
from
each
other
by
political
boundaries
and
have
no
such
coherence
among
themselves
as
would
come
from
common
leadership
or
a
sense
of
common
origin
and
mutual
dependence
and
they
are
a
people
without
annals
back
of
their
grandfathers
they
have
neither
screed
nor
hearsay
borned
in
the
kentry
and
ai
never
been
out
o
hit
is
all
that
most
of
them
can
say
for
themselves
here
and
there
one
will
assert
my
foreparents
war
principally
scotch
or
us
bumgyarners
baumgartners
was
dutch
but
such
traditions
of
a
foreign
origin
are
uncommon
who
are
these
southern
mountaineers
whence
came
they
what
is
the
secret
of
their
belatedness
and
isolation
before
the
civil
war
they
were
seldom
heard
of
in
the
outside
world
vaguely
it
was
understood
that
the
appalachian
highlands
were
occupied
by
a
peculiar
people
called
mountain
whites
this
odd
name
was
given
them
not
to
distinguish
them
from
mountain
negroes
for
there
were
practically
no
mountain
negroes
but
to
indicate
their
similarity
in
social
condition
and
economic
status
to
the
poor
whites
of
the
southern
lowlands
it
was
assumed
on
no
historical
basis
whatever
that
the
highlanders
came
from
the
more
venturesome
or
desperate
element
of
the
poor
whites
and
differed
from
these
only
to
the
extent
that
environment
had
shaped
them
since
this
theory
still
prevails
throughout
the
south
and
is
accepted
generally
elsewhere
on
its
face
value
it
deserves
just
enough
consideration
to
refute
it
the
unfortunate
class
known
as
poor
whites
in
the
south
is
descended
mainly
from
the
convicts
and
indentured
servants
with
which
england
supplied
labor
to
the
southern
plantations
before
slavery
days
the
cavaliers
who
founded
and
dominated
southern
society
came
from
the
conservative
the
feudal
element
of
england
their
character
and
training
were
essentially
aristocratic
and
military
they
were
not
but
masters
of
plantations
their
chief
crop
and
article
of
export
was
tobacco
the
culture
of
tobacco
required
an
abundance
of
cheap
and
servile
labor
on
the
plantations
there
was
little
demand
for
skilled
labor
small
room
anywhere
for
a
middle
class
of
manufacturers
and
merchants
no
inducement
for
independent
farmers
who
would
till
with
their
own
hands
outside
of
the
planters
and
a
small
professional
class
there
was
little
employment
offered
save
what
was
menial
and
degrading
consequently
the
south
was
shunned
from
the
beginning
by
british
yeomanry
and
by
the
thrifty
teutons
such
as
flocked
into
the
northern
provinces
the
demand
for
menials
on
the
plantations
was
met
then
by
importing
from
great
britain
these
were
obtained
in
three
convicted
criminals
were
deported
to
serve
out
their
terms
on
the
plantations
some
of
these
had
been
charged
only
with
political
offenses
and
had
the
making
of
good
citizens
but
the
greater
number
were
rogues
of
the
shiftless
and
petty
delinquent
order
such
as
were
too
lazy
to
work
but
not
desperate
enough
to
have
incurred
capital
sentences
boys
and
girls
chiefly
from
the
slums
of
british
seaports
were
kidnapped
and
sold
into
temporary
slavery
on
the
plantations
impoverished
people
who
wished
to
emigrate
but
could
not
pay
for
their
passage
voluntarily
sold
their
services
for
a
term
of
years
in
return
for
transportation
thus
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
white
laborers
of
the
south
in
the
seventeenth
century
were
criminals
or
from
the
start
a
large
number
of
the
others
came
from
the
dregs
of
society
as
for
the
remainder
the
companionships
into
which
they
were
thrust
the
brutalities
to
which
they
were
subjected
their
impotence
before
the
law
the
contempt
in
which
they
were
held
by
the
ruling
caste
and
the
wretchedness
of
their
prospect
when
released
were
enough
to
undermine
all
but
the
strongest
characters
few
ever
succeeded
in
rising
to
respectable
positions
then
came
a
vast
social
change
at
a
time
when
the
laboring
classes
of
europe
had
achieved
emancipation
from
serfdom
and
feudalism
was
overthrown
african
slavery
in
our
own
southland
laid
the
foundation
for
a
new
feudalism
southern
society
reverted
to
a
type
that
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
had
outgrown
the
effect
upon
white
labor
was
deplorable
the
former
were
now
freedmen
it
is
true
but
freedmen
shorn
of
such
opportunities
as
they
were
fitted
to
use
sprung
from
a
more
or
less
degraded
stock
still
branded
by
caste
untrained
to
any
career
demanding
skill
and
intelligence
devitalized
by
evil
habits
of
life
densely
ignorant
of
the
world
around
them
these
the
naturally
shiftless
were
now
turned
out
into
the
backwoods
to
shift
for
themselves
it
was
inevitable
that
most
of
them
should
degenerate
even
below
the
level
of
their
former
estate
for
they
were
no
longer
forced
into
steady
industry
the
white
freedmen
generally
became
squatters
on
such
land
as
was
unfit
for
tobacco
cotton
and
other
crops
profitable
to
as
the
plantations
expanded
these
freedmen
were
pushed
further
and
further
back
upon
more
and
more
sterile
soil
they
became
or
or
crackers
gaining
a
bare
subsistence
from
corn
planted
and
tended
chiefly
by
the
women
and
children
from
hogs
running
wild
in
the
forest
and
from
desultory
hunting
and
fishing
as
a
class
such
whites
lapsed
into
sloth
and
apathy
even
the
institution
of
slavery
they
regarded
with
cynical
tolerance
doubtless
realizing
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
blacks
they
would
be
slaves
themselves
now
these
poor
whites
had
nothing
to
do
with
settling
the
mountains
there
was
then
and
still
is
plenty
of
wild
land
for
them
in
their
native
lowlands
they
had
neither
the
initiative
nor
the
courage
to
seek
a
promised
land
far
away
among
the
unexplored
and
savage
peaks
of
the
western
country
they
were
a
brave
enough
folk
in
facing
familiar
dangers
but
they
had
a
terror
of
the
unknown
being
densely
ignorant
and
superstitious
the
mountains
to
those
who
ever
heard
of
them
suggested
nothing
but
laborious
climbing
amid
mysterious
and
portentous
perils
the
poor
whites
were
not
highlanders
by
descent
nor
had
they
a
whit
of
the
bold
spirit
of
our
western
pioneers
they
never
entered
appalachia
until
after
it
had
been
won
and
settled
by
a
far
manlier
race
and
even
then
they
went
only
in
driblets
the
theory
that
the
southern
mountains
were
peopled
mainly
by
outcasts
or
refugees
from
old
settlements
in
the
lowlands
rests
on
no
other
basis
than
imagination
how
the
mountains
actually
were
settled
is
another
and
a
very
different
the
first
frontiersmen
of
the
appalachians
were
those
swiss
and
palatine
germans
who
began
flocking
into
pennsylvania
about
they
settled
westward
of
the
quakers
in
the
fertile
limestone
belts
at
the
foot
of
the
blue
ridge
and
the
alleghanies
here
they
formed
the
quakers
buffer
against
the
indians
and
for
some
time
theirs
were
the
westernmost
settlements
of
british
subjects
in
america
these
germans
were
of
the
reformed
or
lutheran
faith
they
were
strongly
democratic
in
a
social
sense
and
detested
slavery
they
were
model
farmers
and
many
of
them
were
skilled
workmen
at
trades
shortly
after
the
tide
of
german
immigration
set
into
pennsylvania
another
and
quite
different
class
of
foreigners
began
to
arrive
in
this
province
attracted
hither
by
the
same
lodestones
that
drew
the
germans
namely
democratic
institutions
and
religious
liberty
these
newcomers
were
the
or
ulstermen
of
ireland
when
james
in
confiscated
the
estates
of
the
native
irish
in
six
counties
of
ulster
he
planted
them
with
scotch
and
english
presbyterians
these
outsiders
came
to
be
known
as
because
they
were
chiefly
of
scotch
blood
and
had
settled
in
ireland
the
native
irish
to
whom
they
were
alien
both
by
blood
and
by
religion
detested
them
as
usurpers
and
fought
them
many
a
bloody
battle
in
time
as
their
leases
in
ulster
began
to
expire
the
themselves
came
in
conflict
with
the
crown
by
whom
they
were
persecuted
and
evicted
then
the
ulstermen
began
immigrating
in
large
numbers
to
pennsylvania
as
froude
says
in
the
two
years
that
followed
the
antrim
evictions
thirty
thousand
protestants
left
ulster
for
a
land
where
there
was
no
legal
robbery
and
where
those
who
sowed
the
seed
could
reap
the
harvest
so
it
was
that
these
people
became
in
their
turn
our
westernmost
frontiersmen
taking
up
land
just
outside
the
german
settlements
immediately
they
began
to
clash
with
the
indians
and
there
followed
a
long
series
of
border
wars
waged
with
extreme
ferocity
in
which
sometimes
it
is
hard
to
say
which
side
was
most
to
blame
one
thing
however
is
certain
if
any
race
was
ordained
to
exterminate
the
indians
that
race
was
the
they
were
a
brave
but
folk
as
might
be
expected
of
a
people
who
for
a
century
had
been
planted
amid
hostile
hibernians
justin
winsor
describes
them
as
having
all
that
excitable
character
which
goes
with
a
adherence
to
original
sin
total
depravity
predestination
and
election
and
as
seeing
no
use
in
an
indian
but
to
be
a
target
for
their
bullets
they
were
as
well
as
rather
visionary
imperious
and
aggressive
being
by
tradition
and
habit
a
border
people
the
pushed
to
the
extreme
western
fringe
of
settlement
amid
the
alleghanies
they
were
not
about
the
quality
of
soil
when
arthur
lee
of
virginia
was
telling
doctor
samuel
johnson
in
london
of
a
colony
of
scotch
who
had
settled
upon
a
particularly
sterile
tract
in
western
virginia
and
had
expressed
his
wonder
that
they
should
do
so
johnson
replied
why
sir
all
barrenness
is
comparative
the
scotch
will
never
know
that
it
is
barren
west
of
the
susquehanna
however
the
land
was
so
rocky
and
poor
that
even
the
scotch
shied
at
it
and
so
when
eastern
pennsylvania
became
crowded
the
overflow
of
settlers
passed
not
westward
but
southwestward
along
the
cumberland
valley
into
western
maryland
and
then
into
the
shenandoah
and
those
other
long
narrow
parallel
valleys
of
western
virginia
that
we
noted
in
our
first
chapter
this
western
region
still
lay
unoccupied
and
scarcely
known
by
the
virginians
themselves
its
fertile
lands
were
discovered
by
pennsylvania
dutchmen
the
first
house
in
western
virginia
was
erected
by
one
of
them
joist
hite
and
he
established
a
colony
of
his
people
near
the
future
site
of
winchester
a
majority
of
those
who
settled
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
shenandoah
valley
were
pennsylvania
dutch
while
the
following
in
their
train
pushed
a
little
to
the
west
of
them
and
occupied
more
exposed
positions
there
were
representatives
of
other
races
along
the
border
english
irish
french
huguenots
and
so
on
but
everywhere
the
and
germans
predominated
and
the
southwestward
movement
once
started
never
stopped
so
there
went
on
a
gradual
but
sure
progress
of
northern
peoples
across
the
potomac
up
the
shenandoah
across
the
staunton
the
dan
the
yadkin
until
the
western
piedmont
and
region
of
carolina
was
similarly
settled
chiefly
by
pennsylvanians
the
archivist
of
north
carolina
the
late
william
saunders
secretary
of
state
said
in
one
of
his
historical
sketches
that
to
lancaster
and
york
counties
in
pennsylvania
north
carolina
owes
more
of
her
population
than
to
any
other
known
part
of
the
world
he
called
attention
to
the
interesting
fact
that
when
the
north
carolina
boys
of
and
pennsylvania
dutch
descent
followed
lee
into
pennsylvania
in
the
gettysburg
campaign
they
were
returning
to
the
homes
of
their
ancestors
by
precisely
the
same
route
that
those
ancestors
had
taken
in
going
south
among
those
who
made
the
long
trek
from
pennsylvania
southward
in
the
eighteenth
century
were
daniel
boone
and
the
ancestors
of
david
crockett
samuel
houston
john
calhoun
stonewall
jackson
and
abraham
lincoln
boone
and
the
lincolns
although
english
themselves
had
been
neighbors
in
berks
county
one
of
the
most
german
parts
of
all
eastern
pennsylvania
so
the
western
piedmont
and
the
mountains
were
settled
neither
by
cavaliers
nor
by
poor
whites
but
by
a
radically
distinct
and
even
antagonistic
people
who
are
appropriately
called
the
roundheads
of
the
south
these
roundheads
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
slavery
detested
the
state
church
loathed
tithes
and
distrusted
all
authority
save
that
of
conspicuous
merit
and
natural
justice
the
first
characteristic
that
these
pioneers
developed
was
an
intense
individualism
the
strong
and
even
violent
independence
that
made
them
forsake
all
the
comforts
of
civilization
and
prefer
the
wild
freedom
of
the
border
was
fanned
at
times
into
turbulence
and
riot
but
it
blazed
forth
at
a
happy
time
for
this
country
when
our
liberties
were
imperilled
daniel
boone
first
appears
in
history
when
from
his
new
home
on
the
yadkin
he
crossed
the
blue
ridge
and
the
unakas
into
that
part
of
western
carolina
which
is
now
eastern
tennessee
he
was
exploring
the
watauga
region
as
early
as
both
british
and
french
indian
traders
and
soldiers
had
been
in
this
region
before
him
but
had
left
few
marks
of
their
wanderings
in
a
party
of
hunters
from
pennsylvania
and
contiguous
counties
of
virginia
piloted
by
boone
began
to
use
this
region
as
a
on
account
of
the
great
abundance
of
game
from
them
and
especially
from
boone
the
fame
of
its
attractions
spread
to
the
settlements
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
mountains
and
in
the
winter
of
the
first
permanent
occupation
of
eastern
tennessee
was
made
by
a
few
families
from
north
carolina
about
this
time
there
broke
out
in
carolina
a
struggle
between
the
independent
settlers
of
the
piedmont
and
the
rich
trading
and
official
class
of
the
coast
the
former
rose
in
bodies
under
the
name
of
regulators
and
a
battle
followed
in
which
they
were
defeated
to
escape
from
the
persecutions
of
the
aristocracy
many
of
the
regulators
and
their
friends
crossed
the
appalachian
mountains
and
built
their
cabins
in
the
watauga
region
here
in
there
was
established
by
these
rebels
the
first
republic
in
america
based
upon
a
written
constitution
the
first
ever
adopted
by
a
community
of
freemen
of
these
pioneers
in
the
winning
of
the
west
theodore
roosevelt
says
as
in
western
virginia
the
first
settlers
came
for
the
most
part
from
pennsylvania
so
in
turn
in
what
was
then
western
north
carolina
and
is
now
eastern
tennessee
the
first
settlers
came
mainly
from
virginia
and
indeed
in
great
part
from
this
same
pennsylvania
stock
boone
first
visited
kentucky
on
a
hunting
trip
in
six
years
later
he
began
to
colonize
it
in
flat
defiance
of
the
british
government
and
in
the
face
of
a
menacing
proclamation
from
the
royal
governor
of
north
carolina
on
the
kentucky
river
three
days
after
the
battle
of
lexington
the
flag
of
the
new
colony
of
transylvania
was
run
up
on
his
fort
at
boonesborough
it
was
not
until
the
following
august
that
these
rebels
of
kentuck
heard
of
the
signing
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
celebrated
it
with
shrill
warwhoops
around
a
bonfire
in
the
center
of
their
stockade
such
was
the
stuff
of
which
the
appalachian
frontiersmen
were
made
they
were
the
first
americans
to
cut
loose
entirely
from
the
seaboard
and
fall
back
upon
their
own
resources
they
were
the
first
to
establish
governments
of
their
own
in
defiance
of
king
and
aristocracy
says
john
fiske
jefferson
is
often
called
the
father
of
modern
american
democracy
in
a
certain
sense
the
shenandoah
valley
and
adjacent
appalachian
regions
may
be
called
its
cradle
in
that
rude
frontier
society
life
assumed
many
new
aspects
old
customs
were
forgotten
old
distinctions
abolished
social
equality
acquired
even
more
importance
than
unchecked
individualism
the
notions
sometimes
crude
and
noxious
sometimes
just
and
wholesome
which
characterized
jeffersonian
democracy
flourished
greatly
on
the
frontier
and
have
thence
been
propagated
eastward
through
the
older
communities
affecting
their
legislation
and
their
politics
more
or
less
according
to
frequency
of
contact
and
intercourse
massachusetts
relatively
remote
and
relatively
ancient
has
been
perhaps
least
affected
by
this
group
of
ideas
but
all
parts
of
the
united
states
have
felt
its
influence
powerfully
this
phase
of
democracy
which
is
destined
to
continue
so
long
as
frontier
life
retains
any
importance
can
nowhere
be
so
well
studied
in
its
beginnings
as
among
the
presbyterian
population
of
the
appalachian
region
in
the
century
during
the
revolution
the
appalachian
frontier
was
held
by
a
double
line
of
the
men
whom
we
have
been
considering
one
line
east
of
the
mountains
and
the
other
west
of
them
the
mountain
region
itself
remained
almost
uninhabited
by
whites
because
the
pioneers
who
crossed
it
were
seeking
better
hunting
grounds
and
farmsteads
than
the
mountains
afforded
it
was
not
until
the
buffalo
and
elk
and
beaver
had
been
driven
out
of
tennessee
and
kentucky
and
those
rolling
savannahs
were
being
fenced
and
tilled
that
much
attention
was
given
to
the
mountains
proper
then
small
companies
of
hunters
and
trappers
from
both
east
and
west
began
to
move
into
the
highlands
and
settle
there
these
explorers
pushing
outward
from
the
trails
in
every
direction
found
many
interesting
things
that
had
been
overlooked
in
the
scurry
of
migration
westward
they
discovered
fair
river
valleys
and
rich
coves
adapted
to
tillage
which
soon
attracted
settlers
of
a
better
class
and
so
gradually
the
mountain
solitudes
began
to
echo
with
the
ring
of
axes
and
the
lowing
of
herds
by
about
a
million
permanent
settlers
occupied
the
southern
appalachians
naturally
most
of
them
came
from
adjoining
regions
from
the
foot
of
the
blue
ridge
on
one
side
and
from
the
foot
of
the
unakas
or
of
the
cumberlands
on
the
other
and
hence
they
were
chiefly
of
the
same
frontier
stock
that
we
have
been
describing
no
colonies
of
farmers
from
a
distance
ever
have
been
imported
into
the
mountains
down
to
our
own
day
deterioration
of
the
mountain
people
began
as
soon
as
population
began
to
press
upon
the
limits
of
subsistence
at
first
naturally
the
best
people
among
the
mountaineers
were
attracted
to
the
best
lands
and
there
in
the
generous
river
valleys
we
find
a
class
of
citizens
superior
to
the
average
mountaineers
that
we
have
been
considering
in
this
book
but
the
number
and
extent
of
such
valleys
was
narrowly
limited
the
united
states
topographers
report
that
in
appalachia
as
a
whole
the
mountain
slopes
occupy
per
cent
of
the
total
area
and
that
per
cent
of
the
land
has
a
steeper
slope
than
one
foot
in
five
so
as
the
years
passed
a
larger
and
larger
proportion
of
the
highlanders
was
forced
back
along
the
creek
branches
and
up
along
the
steep
hillsides
to
scrabble
for
a
living
it
will
be
asked
why
did
not
this
overplus
do
as
other
crowded
americans
did
move
west
first
because
they
were
so
immured
in
the
mountains
so
utterly
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
outer
world
that
they
did
not
know
anything
about
the
opportunities
offered
new
settlers
in
lands
moving
west
to
them
would
have
meant
merely
going
a
few
days
down
into
the
lowlands
of
kentucky
or
tennessee
which
already
were
thickly
settled
by
a
people
of
very
different
social
class
here
they
could
not
hope
to
be
anything
but
tenants
or
menials
ruled
over
by
proprietors
or
bosses
and
they
would
die
rather
than
endure
such
treatment
as
for
the
new
lands
of
the
farther
west
there
was
scarce
a
peasant
in
ireland
or
in
scandinavia
but
knew
more
about
them
than
did
the
southern
mountaineers
second
because
they
were
passionately
attached
to
their
homes
and
kindred
to
their
own
ways
the
mountaineer
shrinks
from
lowland
society
as
he
does
from
the
water
and
the
climate
of
such
regions
he
is
never
at
ease
until
back
with
his
and
free
third
because
there
was
nothing
in
his
environment
to
arouse
ambition
the
hard
hopeless
life
of
the
mountain
farm
sustained
only
by
a
meager
and
diet
begat
laziness
and
shiftless
unconcern
finally
the
poverty
of
the
hillside
farmers
and
people
was
so
extreme
that
they
could
not
gather
funds
to
emigrate
with
there
were
no
industries
to
which
a
man
might
turn
and
earn
ready
money
no
markets
in
which
he
could
sell
a
surplus
from
the
farm
so
while
the
transmontane
settlers
grew
rapidly
in
wealth
and
culture
their
kinsfolk
back
in
the
mountains
either
stood
still
or
retrograded
and
the
contrast
was
due
not
nearly
so
much
to
any
difference
of
capacity
as
to
a
law
of
nature
that
dooms
an
isolated
and
impoverished
people
to
deterioration
beyond
this
it
is
not
to
be
overlooked
that
the
mountains
were
cursed
with
a
considerable
incubus
of
naturally
weak
or
depraved
characters
not
lowland
poor
whites
but
a
miscellaneous
flotsam
from
all
quarters
which
after
more
or
less
circling
round
and
round
was
drawn
into
the
stagnant
eddy
of
highland
society
as
derelicts
drift
into
the
sargasso
sea
in
the
train
of
western
immigration
there
were
some
feeble
souls
who
never
got
across
the
mountains
these
have
been
described
tersely
as
the
men
who
lost
heart
on
account
of
a
broken
axle
the
anemic
element
thus
introduced
is
less
noticeable
in
kentucky
than
in
virginia
and
the
states
farther
south
for
the
reason
no
doubt
that
it
took
at
least
two
axles
to
reach
kentucky
but
it
exists
in
all
parts
of
appalachia
moreover
the
vast
roughs
of
the
mountain
region
offered
harborage
for
outlaws
desperadoes
of
the
border
and
here
many
of
them
settled
and
propagated
their
kind
in
the
backwoods
one
can
not
choose
his
neighbors
all
are
on
equal
footing
hence
the
contagion
of
crime
and
shiftlessness
spreads
to
decent
families
and
tends
to
undermine
them
we
can
understand
then
how
it
happened
in
many
cases
that
highland
families
founded
by
and
thrifty
pioneers
deteriorated
into
illiterate
and
idle
triflers
all
run
down
at
heels
family
is
an
apt
illustration
his
grandfather
sold
his
virginia
farms
for
seventeen
thousand
dollars
and
bought
large
tracts
of
land
in
kentucky
but
abraham
lincoln
father
set
up
housekeeping
in
a
shed
later
built
a
log
hut
of
one
room
without
doors
or
windows
although
he
was
a
carpenter
by
trade
then
moved
to
another
cabin
a
little
better
tired
of
it
moved
over
into
indiana
and
made
his
family
spend
the
winter
in
a
camp
where
they
were
saved
from
freezing
by
keeping
up
a
great
log
fire
in
front
of
the
through
days
and
nights
when
the
temperature
was
far
below
zero
the
lincolns
were
not
mountaineers
but
they
were
of
the
same
stock
and
were
subjected
to
much
the
same
vicissitudes
so
the
southern
highlanders
languished
in
isolation
sunk
in
a
rip
van
winkle
sleep
until
aroused
by
the
of
the
civil
war
let
john
fox
tell
the
extraordinary
result
of
that
the
american
mountaineer
was
discovered
i
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
when
the
confederate
leaders
were
counting
on
the
presumption
that
mason
and
dixon
line
was
the
dividing
line
between
the
north
and
south
and
formed
therefore
the
plan
of
marching
an
army
from
wheeling
in
west
virginia
to
some
point
on
the
lakes
and
thus
dissevering
the
north
at
one
blow
the
plan
seemed
so
feasible
that
it
is
said
to
have
materially
aided
the
sale
of
confederate
bonds
in
england
but
when
captain
garnett
a
west
point
graduate
started
to
carry
it
out
he
got
no
farther
than
harper
ferry
when
he
struck
the
mountains
he
struck
enemies
who
shot
at
his
men
from
ambush
cut
down
bridges
before
him
carried
the
news
of
his
march
to
the
federals
and
garnett
himself
fell
with
a
bullet
from
a
mountaineer
squirrel
rifle
at
harper
ferry
then
the
south
began
to
realize
what
a
long
lean
powerful
arm
of
the
union
it
was
that
the
southern
mountaineer
stretched
through
its
very
vitals
for
that
arm
helped
hold
kentucky
in
the
union
by
giving
preponderance
to
the
union
sympathizers
in
the
it
kept
the
east
tennesseans
loyal
to
the
man
it
made
west
virginia
as
the
phrase
goes
from
secession
it
drew
out
a
horde
of
one
hundred
thousand
volunteers
when
lincoln
called
for
troops
depleting
jackson
county
kentucky
for
instance
of
every
male
under
sixty
years
of
age
and
over
fifteen
and
it
raised
a
hostile
barrier
between
the
armies
of
the
coast
and
the
armies
of
the
mississippi
the
north
has
never
realized
perhaps
what
it
owes
for
its
victory
to
this
southern
mountaineer
president
frost
of
berea
college
says
the
loyalty
of
this
region
in
the
civil
war
was
a
surprise
to
both
northern
and
southern
statesmen
the
mountain
people
owned
land
but
did
not
own
slaves
and
the
national
feeling
of
the
revolutionary
period
had
not
spent
its
force
among
them
their
services
in
west
virginia
and
east
tennessee
are
perhaps
generally
known
but
very
few
know
or
remember
that
the
whole
mountain
region
was
loyal
except
where
conscripted
general
carl
schurz
had
soldiers
enlisted
in
the
mountains
of
alabama
and
the
writer
has
recently
seen
a
letter
written
by
the
confederate
governor
of
south
carolina
in
which
he
relates
to
general
hardee
the
troubles
caused
by
union
sentiment
in
the
mountain
counties
it
is
pathetic
to
know
how
these
mountain
regiments
disbanded
with
no
poet
or
historian
or
monument
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
their
valor
the
very
flag
that
was
first
on
lookout
mountain
and
above
the
clouds
was
lost
to
fame
in
an
obscure
mountain
home
until
berea
discovered
and
rescued
it
from
oblivion
and
destruction
it
may
be
added
that
no
other
part
of
our
country
suffered
longer
or
more
severely
from
the
aftermath
of
war
throughout
that
struggle
the
mountain
region
was
a
nest
for
bushwhackers
and
bandits
that
preyed
upon
the
aged
and
defenseless
who
were
left
at
home
and
thus
there
was
left
an
evil
legacy
of
neighborhood
wrongs
and
private
grudges
most
of
the
mountain
counties
had
incurred
the
bitter
hostility
of
their
own
states
by
standing
loyal
to
the
union
after
appomattox
they
were
cast
back
into
a
worse
isolation
than
they
had
ever
known
most
unfortunately
too
the
federal
government
at
this
juncture
instead
of
interposing
to
restore
law
and
order
in
the
highlands
turned
the
loyalty
of
the
mountaineers
into
outlawry
as
in
by
imposing
a
prohibitive
excise
tax
upon
their
chief
merchantable
commodity
left
then
to
their
own
devices
unchecked
by
any
stronger
arm
inflamed
by
a
multitude
of
personal
wrongs
habituated
to
the
shedding
of
human
blood
contemptuous
of
state
laws
that
did
not
reach
them
enraged
by
federal
acts
that
impugned
as
they
thought
an
inalienable
right
of
man
it
was
inevitable
that
this
fiery
and
vindictive
race
should
fall
speedily
into
warring
among
themselves
old
scores
were
now
to
be
wiped
out
in
a
reign
of
terror
the
open
combat
of
bannered
war
was
turned
into
the
secret
ferocity
of
family
feuds
but
the
mountaineers
of
are
face
to
face
with
a
mighty
change
the
feud
epoch
has
ceased
throughout
the
greater
part
of
appalachia
a
new
era
dawns
everywhere
the
highways
of
civilization
are
pushing
into
remote
mountain
fastnesses
vast
enterprises
are
being
installed
the
timber
and
the
minerals
are
being
garnered
the
mighty
waterpower
that
has
been
running
to
waste
since
these
mountains
rose
from
the
primal
sea
is
now
about
to
be
harnessed
in
the
service
of
man
along
with
this
economic
revolution
will
come
inevitably
good
schools
newspapers
a
finer
and
more
liberal
social
life
the
highlander
at
last
is
to
be
caught
up
in
the
current
of
human
progress
chapter
xvii
when
the
sleeper
wakes
the
southern
mountaineers
are
a
rural
folk
when
the
twentieth
century
opened
only
four
per
cent
of
them
dwelt
in
cities
of
inhabitants
and
upwards
there
were
but
seven
such
cities
in
all
appalachia
a
region
larger
than
england
and
scotland
combined
and
these
owed
their
development
to
outside
influences
only
out
of
mountain
counties
had
towns
of
and
upwards
our
highlanders
are
the
most
homogeneous
people
in
the
united
states
in
out
of
a
total
population
of
there
were
only
of
foreign
birth
this
includes
the
cities
and
industrial
camps
back
in
the
mountains
a
man
using
any
other
tongue
than
english
or
speaking
broken
english
was
regarded
as
a
freak
nine
mountain
counties
of
virginia
four
of
west
virginia
fifteen
of
kentucky
ten
of
tennessee
nine
of
north
carolina
eight
of
georgia
two
of
alabama
and
one
of
south
carolina
had
less
than
ten
residents
each
three
of
them
had
none
at
all
compare
the
north
atlantic
states
in
this
same
census
year
per
cent
of
their
people
lived
in
cities
of
and
upwards
as
for
foreigners
the
one
city
of
fall
river
with
inhabitants
had
of
foreign
birth
the
mountains
proper
are
free
not
only
from
foreigners
but
from
negroes
as
well
there
are
many
blacks
in
the
larger
valleys
and
towns
but
throughout
most
of
appalachia
the
population
is
almost
exclusively
white
in
jackson
county
the
same
that
sent
every
one
of
its
sons
into
the
union
army
who
could
bear
arms
had
only
nineteen
negroes
among
whites
johnson
county
only
one
black
resident
among
whites
dickenson
county
not
a
single
negro
within
its
borders
in
many
mountain
settlements
negroes
are
not
allowed
to
tarry
it
has
been
assumed
that
this
prejudice
against
colored
folk
had
its
origin
far
back
in
the
time
when
poor
whites
found
themselves
thrust
aside
by
competition
with
slave
labor
this
is
an
error
our
mountaineers
never
had
to
compete
with
slavery
few
of
them
knew
anything
about
it
except
from
hearsay
their
dislike
of
negroes
is
simply
an
instinctive
racial
antipathy
plus
a
contempt
for
anyone
who
submits
to
servile
conditions
a
neighbor
in
the
smokies
said
to
me
i
in
treatin
niggers
squar
the
bible
says
they
human
leastways
some
says
it
does
and
so
there
orter
be
a
place
for
them
but
it
place
not
around
me
that
is
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
here
then
is
appalachia
one
of
the
great
areas
of
the
globe
more
english
in
speech
than
britain
itself
more
american
by
blood
than
any
other
part
of
america
encompassed
by
a
civilization
yet
less
affected
by
modern
ideas
less
cognizant
of
modern
progress
than
any
other
part
of
the
world
of
course
such
an
anomaly
can
not
continue
commercialism
has
discovered
the
mountains
at
last
and
no
sentiment
however
honest
however
hallowed
can
keep
it
out
the
transformation
is
swift
suddenly
the
mountaineer
is
awakened
from
his
bed
by
the
blare
of
steam
whistles
and
the
boom
of
dynamite
he
sees
his
forests
leveled
and
whisked
away
his
rivers
dammed
by
concrete
walls
and
shot
into
turbines
that
outpower
all
the
horses
in
appalachia
he
is
dazed
by
electric
lights
nonplussed
by
speaking
wires
awed
by
vast
transfers
of
property
incensed
by
rude
demands
aroused
now
and
he
realizes
with
sinking
heart
that
here
is
a
sudden
end
of
that
old
dispensation
under
which
he
and
his
ancestors
were
born
the
beginning
of
a
new
order
that
heeds
him
and
his
neighbors
not
a
whit
all
this
insults
his
conservatism
the
old
way
was
the
established
order
of
the
universe
to
change
it
is
fairly
impious
what
is
the
good
of
all
this
fuss
and
fury
that
building
they
tell
about
in
their
big
city
what
is
it
but
another
tower
of
babel
and
these
silly
strangers
who
brag
and
brag
about
modern
improvements
what
are
they
under
their
fine
manners
and
fine
clothes
hirelings
all
shrewdly
he
observes
them
in
their
relations
to
each
each
man
is
some
man
servant
every
soul
is
by
some
other
presence
quite
discrowned
proudly
he
contrasts
his
ragged
self
he
who
never
has
acknowledged
a
superior
never
has
taken
an
order
from
living
man
save
as
a
patriot
in
time
of
war
and
he
turns
upon
his
heel
yet
before
he
can
fairly
credit
it
as
a
reality
the
lands
around
his
own
home
are
bought
up
by
corporations
all
about
him
slash
crash
go
the
devastating
forces
his
old
neighbors
vanish
new
and
unwelcome
ones
swarm
in
he
is
crowded
but
ignored
his
patrimony
is
robbed
of
all
that
made
it
precious
its
seclusion
independence
dignity
he
sells
out
and
moves
away
to
some
uninvaded
place
where
he
will
not
be
bothered
i
do
like
these
said
an
old
mountaineer
to
me
some
calls
them
and
says
they
put
money
to
circulatin
so
they
do
but
gits
there
is
a
class
of
highlanders
more
sanguine
more
adaptable
that
welcomes
all
outsiders
who
come
with
skill
and
capital
to
develop
their
country
many
of
these
are
shrewd
traders
in
merchandise
or
in
real
estate
or
they
are
capable
foremen
who
can
handle
native
labor
much
better
than
any
strangers
could
such
men
naturally
profit
by
the
change
others
deluded
by
what
seems
easy
money
sell
their
little
homesteads
for
just
enough
cash
to
set
them
up
as
laborers
in
town
or
camp
being
untrained
to
any
trade
they
can
get
only
the
lowest
wages
which
are
quickly
dissipated
in
rent
and
in
foods
that
formerly
they
raised
for
themselves
unused
to
continuous
labor
they
irk
under
its
discipline
drop
out
and
fall
into
desultory
habits
meantime
false
ambitions
arise
especially
among
the
womenfolk
store
credit
soon
runs
such
a
family
in
debt
when
i
was
a
young
man
said
one
of
my
neighbors
the
traders
never
thought
of
bringin
meal
in
here
if
a
man
run
out
of
meal
why
he
was
and
he
had
to
live
on
or
somethin
else
nowadays
we
dress
better
and
live
better
but
some
other
feller
allers
has
his
hands
in
our
pockets
then
it
is
to
the
old
independence
that
made
such
characters
manly
enmeshed
in
obligations
that
they
can
not
meet
they
struggle
vainly
brood
hopelessly
and
lose
that
dearest
of
all
possessions
their
servility
is
literal
hell
to
a
mountaineer
and
when
it
is
forced
upon
him
he
turns
into
a
mean
underhanded
slinking
fellow
easily
tempted
into
crime
the
curse
of
our
invading
civilization
is
that
its
vanguard
is
composed
of
men
who
care
nothing
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
they
dispossess
a
northern
lumberman
admitted
to
me
with
frankness
unusual
in
his
class
that
all
we
want
here
is
to
get
the
most
we
can
out
of
this
country
as
quick
as
we
can
and
then
get
out
this
is
all
we
can
expect
of
those
who
exploit
raw
materials
or
of
manufactures
that
employ
only
cheap
labor
until
we
have
industries
that
demand
skilled
workmen
and
until
manual
training
schools
are
established
in
the
mountains
we
may
look
for
deterioration
rather
than
betterment
of
those
highlanders
who
leave
their
farms
all
who
know
the
mountaineers
intimately
have
observed
that
the
sudden
inroad
of
commercialism
has
a
bad
effect
upon
them
as
president
frost
says
ruthless
change
is
knocking
at
the
door
of
every
mountain
cabin
the
jackals
of
civilization
have
already
abused
the
confidence
of
many
a
highland
home
the
lumber
coal
and
mineral
wealth
of
the
mountains
is
to
be
possessed
and
the
unprincipled
vanguard
of
commercialism
can
easily
debauch
a
simple
people
the
question
is
whether
the
mountain
people
can
be
enlightened
and
guided
so
that
they
can
have
a
part
in
the
development
of
their
own
country
or
whether
they
must
give
place
to
foreigners
and
melt
away
like
so
many
indians
it
is
easy
to
say
that
the
fittest
will
survive
but
the
fittest
for
what
miss
miles
answers
i
have
heard
it
said
that
civilization
when
it
touches
the
people
of
the
backwoods
acts
as
a
useful
precipitant
in
thus
sending
the
dregs
to
the
bottom
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
only
the
shrewder
and
more
determined
not
the
truly
fit
that
survive
the
struggle
among
these
very
submerged
ones
reduced
to
dependence
on
an
alien
people
there
are
thousands
who
inherit
the
skill
of
their
forefathers
who
fashioned
their
own
locks
musical
instruments
and
guns
and
these
very
women
who
are
breaking
their
health
and
spirit
over
a
thankless
tub
of
suds
ought
surely
to
turn
their
talents
to
better
account
ought
to
be
designing
and
weaving
coverlets
and
rugs
or
the
quilt
patterns
now
so
popular
need
these
razors
be
used
to
cut
grindstones
must
this
free
folk
who
are
in
many
ways
the
truest
americans
of
america
be
brought
under
the
yoke
of
caste
division
to
the
degradation
of
all
their
finer
qualities
merely
for
lack
of
the
right
work
to
do
there
are
some
who
would
have
it
so
who
would
calmly
write
for
these
our
own
kindred
as
for
the
indians
their
day
is
past
in
a
history
of
southern
literature
written
not
long
ago
by
a
professor
in
the
university
of
virginia
a
sketch
of
miss
murfree
work
closes
with
these
words
there
at
beersheba
springs
it
was
that
she
first
studied
the
curious
type
of
humanity
the
tennessee
mountaineer
a
people
so
ignorant
so
superstitious
so
far
behind
the
world
of
as
to
excite
wonder
and
even
pity
in
all
who
see
them
she
is
telling
the
story
of
a
people
who
in
these
opening
years
of
the
century
wander
on
through
their
limited
range
of
life
much
as
their
ancestors
for
generations
have
wandered
they
too
will
some
time
vanish
the
sooner
the
better
one
can
not
read
such
a
sentiment
without
wonder
and
even
pity
for
the
ignorance
of
history
and
of
human
nature
that
it
discloses
is
the
case
of
our
mountaineers
so
much
worse
than
that
of
the
scotch
highlanders
of
two
centuries
ago
we
know
that
those
scotchmen
did
not
vanish
the
quicker
the
better
what
were
they
before
civilization
reached
them
let
us
open
the
ready
pages
of
it
is
not
easy
for
a
modern
englishman
to
believe
that
in
the
time
of
his
saint
james
street
had
as
little
connection
with
the
grampians
as
with
the
andes
yet
so
it
was
in
the
south
of
our
island
scarcely
anything
was
known
about
the
celtic
part
of
scotland
and
what
was
known
excited
no
feeling
but
contempt
and
loathing
it
is
not
strange
that
the
wild
scotch
as
they
were
sometimes
called
should
in
the
century
have
been
considered
by
the
saxons
as
mere
savages
but
it
is
surely
strange
that
considered
as
savages
they
should
not
have
been
objects
of
interest
and
curiosity
the
english
were
then
abundantly
inquisitive
about
the
manners
of
rude
nations
separated
from
our
island
by
great
continents
and
oceans
numerous
books
were
printed
describing
the
laws
the
superstitions
the
cabins
the
repasts
the
dresses
the
marriages
the
funerals
of
laplanders
and
hottentots
mohawks
and
malays
the
plays
and
poems
of
that
age
are
full
of
allusions
to
the
usages
of
the
black
men
of
africa
and
the
red
men
of
america
the
only
barbarian
about
whom
there
was
no
wish
to
have
any
information
was
the
highlander
while
the
old
gaelic
institutions
were
in
full
vigor
no
account
of
them
was
given
by
any
observer
qualified
to
judge
of
them
fairly
had
such
an
observer
studied
the
character
of
the
highlanders
he
would
doubtless
have
found
in
it
closely
intermingled
the
good
and
the
bad
qualities
of
an
uncivilised
nation
he
would
have
found
that
the
people
had
no
love
for
their
country
or
for
their
king
that
they
had
no
attachment
to
any
commonwealth
larger
than
the
clan
or
to
any
magistrate
superior
to
the
chief
he
would
have
found
that
life
was
governed
by
a
code
of
morality
and
honor
widely
different
from
that
which
is
established
in
peaceful
and
prosperous
societies
he
would
have
learned
that
a
stab
in
the
back
or
a
shot
from
behind
a
fragment
of
rock
were
approved
modes
of
taking
satisfaction
for
insults
he
would
have
heard
men
relate
boastfully
how
they
or
their
fathers
had
wracked
on
hereditary
enemies
in
a
neighboring
valley
such
vengeance
as
would
have
made
old
soldiers
of
the
thirty
years
war
shudder
he
would
have
found
that
robbery
was
held
to
be
a
calling
not
merely
innocent
but
honorable
he
would
have
seen
wherever
he
turned
that
dislike
of
steady
industry
and
that
disposition
to
throw
on
the
weaker
sex
the
heaviest
part
of
manual
labor
which
are
characteristic
of
savages
he
would
have
been
struck
by
the
spectacle
of
athletic
men
basking
in
the
sun
angling
for
salmon
or
taking
aim
at
grouse
while
their
aged
mothers
their
pregnant
wives
their
tender
daughters
were
reaping
the
scanty
harvest
of
oats
nor
did
the
women
repine
at
their
hard
lot
in
their
view
it
was
quite
fit
that
a
man
especially
if
he
assumed
the
aristocratic
title
of
duinhe
wassel
and
adorned
his
bonnet
with
the
feather
should
take
his
ease
except
when
he
was
fighting
hunting
or
marauding
to
mention
the
name
of
such
a
man
in
connection
with
commerce
or
with
any
mechanical
art
was
an
insult
agriculture
was
indeed
less
despised
yet
a
highborn
warrior
was
much
more
becomingly
employed
in
plundering
the
land
of
others
than
in
tilling
his
own
the
religion
of
the
greater
part
of
the
highlands
was
a
rude
mixture
of
popery
and
paganism
the
symbol
of
redemption
was
associated
with
heathen
sacrifices
and
incantations
baptised
men
poured
libations
of
ale
on
one
dæmon
and
set
out
drink
offerings
of
milk
for
another
seers
wrapped
themselves
up
in
bulls
hides
and
awaited
in
that
vesture
the
inspiration
which
was
to
reveal
the
future
even
among
those
minstrels
and
genealogists
whose
hereditary
vocation
was
to
preserve
the
memory
of
past
events
an
enquirer
would
have
found
very
few
who
could
read
in
truth
he
might
easily
have
journeyed
from
sea
to
sea
without
discovering
a
page
of
gaelic
printed
or
written
the
price
which
he
would
have
had
to
pay
for
his
knowledge
of
the
country
would
have
been
heavy
he
would
have
had
to
endure
hardships
as
great
as
if
he
had
sojourned
among
the
esquimaux
or
the
samoyeds
here
and
there
indeed
at
the
castle
of
some
great
lord
who
had
a
seat
in
the
parliament
and
privy
council
and
who
was
accustomed
to
pass
a
large
part
of
his
life
in
the
cities
of
the
south
might
have
been
found
wigs
and
embroidered
coats
plate
and
fine
linen
lace
and
jewels
french
dishes
and
french
wines
but
in
general
the
traveler
would
have
been
forced
to
content
himself
with
very
different
quarters
in
many
dwellings
the
furniture
the
food
the
clothing
nay
the
very
hair
and
skin
of
his
hosts
would
have
put
his
philosophy
to
the
proof
his
lodging
would
sometimes
have
been
in
a
hut
of
which
every
nook
would
have
swarmed
with
vermin
he
would
have
inhaled
an
atmosphere
thick
with
peat
smoke
and
foul
with
a
hundred
exhalations
at
supper
grain
fit
only
for
horses
would
have
been
set
before
him
accompanied
with
a
cake
of
blood
drawn
from
living
cows
some
of
the
company
with
whom
he
would
have
feasted
would
have
been
covered
with
cutaneous
eruptions
and
others
would
have
been
smeared
with
tar
like
sheep
his
couch
would
have
been
the
bare
earth
dry
or
wet
as
the
weather
might
be
and
from
that
couch
he
would
have
risen
half
poisoned
with
stench
half
blind
with
the
reek
of
turf
and
half
mad
with
the
itch
this
is
not
an
attractive
picture
and
yet
an
enlightened
and
dispassionate
observer
would
have
found
in
the
character
and
manners
of
this
rude
people
something
which
might
well
excite
admiration
and
a
good
hope
their
courage
was
what
great
exploits
achieved
in
all
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
have
since
proved
it
to
be
their
intense
attachment
to
their
own
tribe
and
to
their
own
patriarch
though
politically
a
great
evil
partook
of
the
nature
of
virtue
the
sentiment
was
misdirected
and
ill
regulated
but
still
it
was
heroic
there
must
be
some
elevation
of
soul
in
a
man
who
loves
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
and
the
leader
whom
he
follows
with
a
love
stronger
than
the
love
of
life
it
was
true
that
the
highlander
had
few
scruples
about
shedding
the
blood
of
an
enemy
but
it
was
not
less
true
that
he
had
high
notions
of
the
duty
of
observing
faith
to
allies
and
hospitality
to
guests
it
was
true
that
his
predatory
habits
were
most
pernicious
to
the
commonwealth
yet
those
erred
greatly
who
imagined
that
he
bore
any
resemblance
to
villains
who
in
rich
and
well
governed
communities
live
by
stealing
when
he
drove
before
him
the
herds
of
lowland
farmers
up
the
pass
which
led
to
his
native
glen
he
no
more
considered
himself
as
a
thief
than
the
raleighs
and
drakes
considered
themselves
as
thieves
when
they
divided
the
cargoes
of
spanish
galleons
he
was
a
warrior
seizing
lawful
prize
of
war
of
war
never
once
intermitted
during
the
generations
which
had
passed
away
since
the
teutonic
invaders
had
driven
the
children
of
the
soil
to
the
mountains
his
inordinate
pride
of
birth
and
his
contempt
for
labor
and
trade
were
indeed
great
weaknesses
and
had
done
far
more
than
the
inclemency
of
the
air
and
the
sterility
of
the
soil
to
keep
his
country
poor
and
rude
yet
even
here
there
was
some
compensation
it
must
in
fairness
be
acknowledged
that
the
patrician
virtues
were
not
less
widely
diffused
among
the
population
of
the
highlands
than
the
patrician
vices
as
there
was
no
other
part
of
the
island
where
men
sordidly
clothed
lodged
and
fed
indulged
themselves
to
such
a
degree
in
the
idle
sauntering
habits
of
an
aristocracy
so
there
was
no
other
part
of
the
island
where
such
men
had
in
such
a
degree
the
better
qualities
of
an
aristocracy
grace
and
dignity
of
manner
and
that
noble
sensibility
which
makes
dishonor
more
terrible
than
death
a
gentleman
of
skye
or
lochaber
whose
clothes
were
begrimed
with
the
accumulated
filth
of
years
and
whose
hovel
smelt
worse
than
an
english
hogstye
would
often
do
the
honors
of
that
hovel
with
a
lofty
courtesy
worthy
of
the
splendid
circle
of
versailles
though
he
had
as
little
as
the
most
stupid
ploughboys
of
england
it
would
have
been
a
great
error
to
put
him
in
the
same
intellectual
rank
with
such
ploughboys
it
is
indeed
only
by
reading
that
men
can
become
profoundly
acquainted
with
any
science
but
the
arts
of
poetry
and
rhetoric
may
be
carried
near
to
absolute
perfection
and
may
exercise
a
mighty
influence
on
the
public
mind
in
an
age
in
which
books
are
wholly
or
almost
wholly
unknown
so
too
in
the
rudest
communities
of
appalachia
among
the
most
trifling
and
unmoral
natives
of
this
region
among
the
illiterate
and
there
still
is
much
to
excite
admiration
and
good
hope
i
have
not
shrunk
from
telling
the
truth
about
these
people
even
when
it
was
far
from
pleasant
but
i
would
have
preserved
strict
silence
had
i
not
seen
in
the
most
backward
of
them
certain
sterling
qualities
of
manliness
that
our
nation
can
ill
afford
to
waste
it
is
a
truth
as
old
as
the
human
race
that
savageries
may
with
admirable
qualities
of
head
and
heart
the
only
people
who
can
consistently
despair
of
the
future
for
even
the
lowest
of
our
mountaineers
are
those
who
deny
evolution
and
who
believe
with

usher
that
man
was
created
at
on
the
of
october
in
the
year
let
us
remember
sir
and
madam
that
we
ourselves
are
descended
from
white
barbarians
from
william
the
conqueror
you
very
well
how
many
other
ancestors
of
yours
were
walking
about
england
and
elsewhere
at
the
time
of
william
untold
thousands
of
them
were
just
such
people
as
you
can
find
brawling
in
some
mountain
unless
there
has
been
a
deal
of
incest
somewhere
along
your
line
and
you
have
infinitely
more
of
their
blood
in
your
veins
than
you
have
of
the
conqueror
who
by
the
way
could
he
be
would
not
be
tolerated
in
your
for
half
an
hour
i
may
have
made
the
point
too
brutally
plain
but
if
it
sinks
through
the
smug
of
those
who
do
not
belong
to
the
masses
who
act
as
though
civilization
and
morals
and
good
manners
were
entailed
to
them
through
a
mere
dozen
or
so
of
selected
ancestors
i
remain
unrepentant
and
unashamed
let
us
thank
whatever
gods
there
be
that
it
is
not
merely
thou
and
i
our
few
friends
and
next
of
kin
but
all
humanity
that
scientific
faith
embraces
and
will
sustain
people
who
have
been
among
the
southern
mountaineers
testify
says
fox
that
as
a
race
they
are
proud
sensitive
hospitable
kindly
obliging
in
an
unreckoning
way
that
is
almost
pathetic
honest
loyal
in
spite
of
their
common
ignorance
poverty
and
isolation
that
they
are
naturally
capable
eager
to
learn
easy
to
uplift
americans
to
the
core
they
make
the
southern
mountains
a
storehouse
of
patriotism
in
themselves
they
are
an
important
offset
to
the
old
world
outcasts
whom
we
have
welcomed
to
our
shores
and
they
surely
deserve
as
much
consideration
from
the
nation
as
the
negroes
or
as
the
heathen
to
whom
we
give
millions

the

the

lies
mostly
in

hands

native

who

education
fitting
them
for
such
leadership
here
is
where
the
nation
at
large
is
summoned
by
a
solemn
duty
and
it
should
act
quickly
because
commercialism
exploits
and
debauches
quickly
but
the
schools
needed
here
are
not
ordinary

schools
they
should
be
vocational

that
will
