introduction
it
is
characteristic
of
the
atmosphere
of
legend
in
which
gabriele
has
lived
that
even
the
authenticity
of
his
name
has
been
disputed
it
was
said
that
his
real
name
was
gaetano
rapagnetta
and
the
curious
will
find
amongst
the
letters
of
james
huneker
the
boast
that
he
was
the
first
person
to
reveal
to
america
the
fact
that
name
was
rapagnetto
a
purely
personal
contribution
to
the
legend
yet
the
plain
fact
as
proven
by
his
birth
certificate
is
that
the
author
of
the
child
of
pleasure
was
born
at
pescara
on
the
of
march
the
son
of
francesco
paolo
and
luisa
de
benedictis
to
give
this
novel
its
italian
name
was
published
when
was
only
years
of
age
and
except
for
an
unimportant
and
imitative
volume
of
short
stories
it
was
his
first
sustained
prose
work
it
is
the
book
which
at
once
made
the
novelist
famous
in
his
own
country
and
very
soon
afterwards
in
england
and
france
where
it
was
the
first
of
his
works
to
be
translated
in
america
was
already
known
as
the
author
of
a
powerful
realistic
novelette
episcopo
which
was
published
in
chicago
in
two
years
before
the
child
of
pleasure
appeared
in
london
as
has
so
often
happened
since
america
led
the
way
in
introducing
into
the
english
language
a
writer
who
is
one
of
the
foremost
figures
in
continental
european
literature
in
order
to
realize
the
sensation
which
gabriele
created
it
is
necessary
to
glance
back
at
the
opinions
of
some
of
his
early
champions
in
foreign
countries
ouida
claims
i
think
rightly
that
her
article
in
the
which
was
reprinted
in
her
critical
studies
was
the
first
account
in
english
of
the
author
and
his
work
in
the
main
although
besprinkled
with
moral
asides
it
is
with
one
exception
as
good
an
essay
as
any
that
has
since
been
written
on
the
subject
ouida
was
sure
that
the
wickedness
of
was
such
that
the
only
work
of
his
which
will
become
known
to
the
english
public
in
general
will
be
the
delle
because
as
far
as
it
has
gone
it
is
not
indecent
the
other
works
could
not
be
reproduced
in
english
in
proof
of
her
contentions
ouida
disclosed
the
fact
that
the
french
versions
of
the
trilogy
the
child
of
pleasure
the
victim
and
the
triumph
of
death
were
bowdlerized
at
the
same
time
she
obligingly
referred
her
readers
to
some
of
the
choicer
passages
in
the
original
such
as
chapter
x
of
the
child
of
pleasure
where
she
claimed
that
ingenuities
of
indecency
had
been
gratuitously
introduced
for
the
guidance
of
those
interested
in
such
matters
i
may
explain
that
by
a
coincidence
the
ingenuity
in
question
is
almost
identical
with
that
which
was
cited
in
the
earlier
part
of
as
proof
that
victor
margueritte
was
unworthy
of
the
legion
of
honor
after
ouida
in
england
came
the
venerable
vicomte
melchior
de
vogüé
in
france
who
is
best
known
to
readers
in
this
country
for
his
standard
tome
on
the
russian
novel
in
the
austere
pages
of
the
des
deux
he
carefully
explained
to
his
readers
that
lewdness
must
not
be
confused
with
the
obscenities
of
zola
whereat
ouida
protested
that
they
were
alike
in
their
complacent
preoccupation
with
mere
filth
the
frenchman
is
the
sounder
critic
it
must
be
said
for
while
frequently
parallels
some
of
the
most
unclean
in
the
literal
not
the
moral
sense
scenes
and
incidents
in
zola
his
attitude
about
sex
is
as
unlike
zola
as
that
of
the
late
howells
only
in
nana
did
zola
describe
the
life
and
emotions
of
a
woman
whose
whole
life
is
given
up
to
love
and
then
as
we
know
he
chose
a
singularly
crude
and
professional
person
using
her
career
as
a
symbol
of
the
second
empire
has
never
described
women
with
any
other
reason
for
existence
but
love
yet
none
of
his
heroines
has
poor
uninspiring
motives
they
are
amateurs
with
a
skill
undreamed
of
in
nana
philosophy
they
believe
in
love
for
art
sake
consequently
the
french
critic
was
right
in
insisting
that
zola
and
are
two
very
different
persons
although
confounded
in
an
identical
obloquy
by
the
moralists
he
is
however
not
quite
so
subtle
when
he
tries
to
argue
from
this
that
in
the
conventional
sense
is
more
moral
at
this
point
i
will
cite
an
unexpectedly
intelligent
witness
one
of
the
early
admirers
of
in
english
and
the
author
of
an
essay
on
him
which
is
assuredly
the
best
which
has
appeared
in
that
language
this
is
what
henry
james
has
to
say
of
the
child
of
pleasure
in
his
notes
on
novelists
count
andrea
sperelli
is
a
young
man
who
pays
pays
heavily
as
we
take
it
we
are
to
understand
for
an
unbridled
surrender
to
the
life
of
the
senses
whereby
it
is
primarily
a
picture
of
that
life
that
the
story
gives
us
he
is
represented
as
inordinately
as
quite
monstrously
endowed
for
the
career
that
from
the
first
absorbs
and
that
finally
is
to
be
held
we
suppose
to
engulf
him
and
it
is
a
tribute
to
the
truth
with
which
his
endowment
is
presented
that
we
should
scarce
know
where
else
to
look
for
so
complete
and
convincing
an
account
of
such
adventures
casanova
de
seingalt
is
of
course
infinitely
more
copious
but
his
autobiography
is
cheap
loose
journalism
compared
with
the
directed
iridescent
epic
of
count
andrea
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
couched
in
such
euphemistically
appreciative
language
so
accurate
a
summary
of
the
intention
and
quality
of
this
book
casanova
is
pale
diffuse
and
unconvincing
indeed
beside
the
who
so
early
gave
his
full
measure
as
the
supreme
novelist
of
sensual
pleasure
in
this
book
as
arthur
symons
so
well
says
gabriele
comes
to
remind
us
very
definitely
as
only
an
italian
can
of
the
reality
and
the
beauty
of
sensation
of
the
primary
sensations
the
sensations
of
pain
and
pleasure
as
these
come
to
us
from
our
actual
physical
conditions
the
sensation
of
beauty
as
it
comes
to
us
from
the
sight
of
our
eyes
and
the
tasting
of
our
several
senses
the
sensation
of
love
which
to
the
italian
comes
up
from
a
root
in
boccaccio
through
the
stem
of
petrarch
to
the
very
flower
of
dante
and
so
he
becomes
the
idealist
of
material
things
while
seeming
to
materialize
spiritual
things
he
accepts
as
no
one
else
of
our
time
does
the
whole
physical
basis
of
life
the
spirit
which
can
be
known
only
through
the
body
has
declared
that
the
central
male
character
in
all
three
novels
andrea
sperelli
in
the
child
of
pleasure
tullio
hermil
in
the
intruder
and
giorgio
aurispa
in
the
triumph
of
death
are
projections
of
himself
they
are
as
autobiographical
as
stelio
effrena
in
the
fire
of
life
which
is
generally
accepted
as
an
elaboration
of
the
poet
life
with
eleonora
duse
his
attitude
therefore
is
clearly
defined
in
the
passage
where
he
says
in
the
tumult
of
contradictory
impulses
sperelli
had
lost
all
sense
of
will
power
and
all
sense
of
morality
in
abdicating
his
will
had
surrendered
the
sceptre
to
his
instincts
the
æsthetic
was
substituted
for
the
moral
sense
this
æsthetic
sense
which
was
very
subtle
very
powerful
and
always
active
maintained
a
certain
equilibrium
in
the
mind
of
sperelli
intellectuals
such
as
he
brought
up
in
the
religion
of
beauty
always
preserve
a
certain
kind
of
order
even
in
their
worst
depravities
the
conception
of
beauty
is
the
axis
of
their
inmost
being
all
their
passions
turn
upon
that
axis
he
is
in
other
words
the
of
don
juan
pursuing
in
woman
an
elusive
and
impossible
ideal
if
had
not
gone
into
the
adventure
of
the
war
with
its
sequel
at
fiume
we
might
have
continued
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
of
the
adventures
of
this
restless
soul
amongst
feminine
masterpieces
as
a
soldier
and
a
statesman
his
prestige
in
the
world
is
low
and
we
are
apt
to
forget
while
reading
the
political
bombast
of
the
years
of
the
war
and
the
period
after
the
armistice
that
it
differs
in
no
respect
from
all
other
patriotic
claptrap
except
that
it
is
the
work
of
the
greatest
living
master
of
italian
prose
of
this
fact
his
early
novels
are
a
needed
reminder
to
a
generation
which
is
making
its
acquaintance
with
italian
writers
of
through
the
intermediary
of
a
converted
who
can
not
even
retell
the
story
of
christ
without
branding
himself
a
vulgarian
in
the
prim
days
when
young
first
flaunted
his
carnal
delights
and
sorrows
before
a
world
not
yet
released
from
victorian
stuffiness
the
word
vulgar
was
a
polite
english
epithet
for
fleshly
an
adjective
much
beloved
by
indignant
gentlemen
who
were
permitting
their
wrath
to
triumph
over
their
desire
to
be
respectable
it
is
a
word
which
we
apply
nowadays
to
the
writings
of
a
vulgarian
like
papini
whose
name
is
now
as
familiar
to
the
general
public
as
was
when
the
child
of
pleasure
was
first
translated
that
is
a
measure
of
progress
in
this
connection
which
justifies
the
hope
that
the
idealist
of
material
things
will
find
again
an
audience
which
can
understand
and
appreciate
his
quest
has
nothing
to
offer
the
sterile
theorists
of
the
new
illiterate
literature
who
are
as
incapable
of
appreciating
his
refined
and
subtle
perversities
as
they
are
of
admiring
the
beautiful
form
in
which
his
and
exuberant
imagination
clothes
his
conceptions
he
is
an
æsthete
but
his
æstheticism
has
never
expressed
itself
in
barren
theory
but
has
always
turned
to
life
itself
he
realized
at
the
outset
of
his
career
that
life
is
a
physical
thing
which
we
must
compel
to
surrender
all
that
it
can
offer
us
which
the
artist
must
bend
and
shape
to
his
own
creative
purposes
it
has
been
said
that
had
a
philosophy
and
nietzsche
and
tolstoy
were
invoked
as
influences
but
there
is
as
little
of
tolstoy
moralizing
in
the
intruder
as
of
nietzsche
pessimistic
idealism
in
the
child
of
pleasure
or
the
triumph
of
death
whatever
conclusions
may
be
drawn
from
the
problem
of
the
eternal
feminine
as
postulated
in
all
his
novels
and
that
is
the
only
problem
which
he
confronts
it
is
hardly
to
be
dignified
by
the
name
of
a
philosophy
one
gathers
that
men
can
be
exalted
and
destroyed
by
the
attraction
of
women
but
the
author
remains
to
the
end
as
late
certainly
as
when
the
last
of
the
novels
in
the
first
mood
che
si
forse
che
appeared
of
the
opinion
that
they
are
the
one
legitimate
preoccupation
of
the
artist

living
elena

the

foscarina
in

ippolita
in

superb
incarnations
of
the
one
and
ever
varied
problem
which
troubles
the
world
in
which
lives
an
american
critic
henry
dwight
sedgwick
once
demanded
in
tones
of
passionate
scorn
that
be
tried
before
a
jury
of
men

he
called

tale

notes
of
exclamation
included
from
which
one
was
to
conclude
that
the
creator
of
sperelli
hermil
and
aurispa
would
slink
away
discomfited
at
the
very
sound
of
those
names
yet
on
the
other
hand
can
one
imagine
andrea
and
elena
giorgio
and
ippolita
arguing
with
our
advanced
thinkers
of
the
moment
is
monogamy
feasible
or
can
men
and
women
be
friends
is
not
to
be
approached
either
in
a
mood
of
radical
earnestness
or
of
evangelical
fervor
he
must
be
regarded
as
an
artist
of
sensations
an
italian
of
the
renaissance
set
down
in
the
middle
of
a
drab
century
he
began
his
life
by
a
quest
for
perfect
physical
pleasure
through
all
the
senses
and
inaugurated
its
last
phase
with
a
gesture
of
military
courage
which
was
not
only
a
retort
to
those
who
like
croce
had
called
him
a
dilettante
but
an
earnest
of
his
conviction
that
he
was
a
great
artist
of
the
lineage
which
bred
men
who
were
simultaneously
great
men
of
action

with

she
attracted
specially
by
her
sparkling
wit
and
gaiety
and
her
inextinguishable

her
charming
and
expressive

recalled
certain
feminine
profiles

vignettes

was
something

no

heightened

is
a
character
i
have
assumed
for
many
an
evening
lately
but
alas
without
result
so
far

sacrifice

be
consummated
victim
is
ready
the
next
evening
he
arrived
at
the
palace
a
few
minutes
earlier
than
usual
with
a
wonderful
gardenia
in
his
and
a
vague
uneasiness
in
his
mind
his
had
to
stop
in
front
of
the
entrance
the
portico
being
occupied
by
another
carriage
from
which
a
lady
was
alighting
the
liveries
the
horses
the
ceremonial
which
accompanied
her
arrival
all
proclaimed
a
great
position
the
count
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tall
and
graceful
figure
a
scintillation
of
diamonds
in
dark
hair
and
a
slender
foot
on
the
step
as
he
went
upstairs
he
had
a
back
view
of
the
lady
she
ascended
in
front
of
him
with
a
slow
and
rhythmic
movement
her
cloak
lined
with
fur
as
white
as
was
unclasped
at
the
throat
and
slipping
back
revealed
her
shoulders
pale
as
polished
ivory
the
disappearing
into
the
lace
of
the
corsage
with
an
indescribably
soft
and
fleeting
curve
as
of
wings
the
neck
rose
slender
and
round
and
the
hair
twisted
into
a
great
knot
on
the
crown
of
her
head
was
held
in
place
by
jewelled
pins
the
harmonious
gait
of
this
unknown
lady
gave
andrea
such
sincere
pleasure
that
he
stopped
a
moment
on
the
first
landing
to
watch
her
her
long
train
swept
rustling
over
the
stairs
behind
her
came
a
servant
not
immediately
in
the
wake
of
his
mistress
on
the
red
carpet
but
at
the
side
along
the
wall
with
irreproachable
gravity
the
absurd
contrast
between
the
magnificent
creature
and
the
automaton
following
her
brought
a
smile
to
andrea
lips
in
the
anteroom
while
the
servant
was
relieving
her
of
her
cloak
the
lady
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
the
young
man
who
entered
the
servant
announced
excellency
the
duchess
of
scerni
and
immediately
afterwards
it
pleased
andrea
that
his
name
should
be
coupled
so
closely
with
that
of
the
lady
in
question
in
the
were
already
assembled
the
marchese
and
marchesa
the
baron
and
baroness
and
don
filippo
del
monte
the
fire
burned
cheerily
on
the
hearth
and
several
low
seats
were
invitingly
disposed
within
range
of
its
warmth
while
large
leaf
plants
spread
their
foliage
over
the
low
backs
the
marchesa
advanced
to
meet
the
two
new
arrivals
with
her
delightful
ready
laugh
she
said
happy
chance

forestalled
me
and
made
it
unnecessary

me
to
tell
you
one
another
names
cousin
sperelli
make
obeisance
before
the
divine
elena
andrea
bowed
profoundly
the
duchess
held
out
her
hand
with
a
frank
and
graceful
gesture
am
very
glad
to
know
you
count
she
said
looking
him
full
in
the
face
heard
so
much
about
you
last
summer
at
lucerne
from
one
of
your
friends
giulio
musellaro
i
must
confess
i
was
rather
curious
besides
musellaro
lent
me
your
exquisite
story
of
the
hermaphrodite
and
made
me
a
present
of
your
etching
sleep
a
proof
copy
a
real
gem
you
have
a
most
ardent
admirer
in
me
please
remember
that
she
spoke
with
little
pauses
in
between
her
voice
was
so
warm
and
insinuating
in
tone
that
it
almost
had
the
effect
of
a
caress
and
her
glance
had
that
unconsciously
voluptuous
and
disturbing
expression
which
instantly
kindles
the
desire
of
every
man
on
whom
it
rests
sakumi
announced
the
servant
as
the
eighth
and
last
guest
made
his
appearance
he
was
one
of
the
secretaries
to
the
japanese
legation
very
small
and
yellow
with
prominent
and
long
slanting
bloodshot
eyes
over
which
the
lids
blinked
incessantly
his
body
was
disproportionately
large
for
his
spindle
legs
and
he
turned
his
toes
in
as
he
walked
the
skirts
of
his
coat
were
too
wide
there
was
a
multitude
of
wrinkles
in
his
trousers
his
necktie
bore
visible
evidence
of
an
unpractised
hand
it
was
as
if
a
had
been
taken
out
of
one
of
those
cuirasses
of
iron
and
lacquer
so
like
the
shell
of
some
monstrous
crustacean
and
thrust
into
the
clothes
of
a
european
waiter
and
yet
with
all
his
ungainliness
and
apparent
stupidity
there
was
a
glint
of
malice
in
his
slits
of
eyes
and
a
sort
of
ironical
cunning
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
bowed
low
his
gibus
slipped
from
his
hand
and
rolled
over
the
floor
at
this
the
baroness
a
tiny
blonde
with
a
cloud
of
fluffy
curls
all
over
her
forehead
vivacious
and
grimacing
as
a
young
monkey
called
to
him
in
her
piping
voice
over
here
sakumi
here
beside
me
the
japanese
cavalier
advanced
with
a
succession
of
bows
and
smiles
we
see
the
princess
issé
this
evening
asked
donna
francesca
who
had
a
mania
for
gathering
in
her
all
the
most
grotesque
specimens
of
the
exotic
colonies
of
rome
out
of
pure
love
of
variety
and
the
picturesque
the
asiatic
replied
in
a
barbarous
jargon
a
scarcely
intelligible
compound
of
english
french
and
italian
for
a
moment
everybody
was
speaking
at
once
a
chorus
through
which
now
and
then
the
fresh
laughter
of
the
marchesa
rang
like
silver
bells
am
sure
i
have
seen
you
before
i
can
not
remember
when
and
i
can
not
remember
where
but
i
am
certain
i
have
seen
you
andrea
sperelli
was
saying
to
the
duchess
as
he
stood
before
her
i
saw
you
going
upstairs
in
front
of
me
a
vague
recollection
rose
up
in
my
mind
something
that
took
shape
from
the
rhythm
of
your
movements
as
a
picture
grows
out
of
a
melody
i
did
not
succeed
in
making
the
recollection
clear
but
when
you
turned
round
i
felt
that
your
profile
answered
incontestably
to
that
picture
it
could
not
have
been
a
divination
therefore
it
must
have
been
some
obscure
phenomenon
of
memory
i
must
have
seen
you
somewhere
before
who
knows
perhaps
in
a
dream
perhaps
in
another
world
a
previous
existence
as
he
pronounced
this
last
decidedly
hackneyed
not
to
say
silly
remark
andrea
laughed
frankly
as
if
to
forestall
the
lady
smile
whether
of
incredulity
or
irony
but
elena
remained
perfectly
serious
was
she
listening
or
was
she
thinking
of
something
else
did
she
accept
that
kind
of
speech
or
was
she
by
her
gravity
amusing
herself
at
his
expense
did
she
intend
assisting
him
in
the
scheme
of
seduction
he
had
begun
with
so
much
care
or
was
she
going
to
shut
herself
up
in
indifference
and
silence
in
short
was
she
or
was
she
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
succumb
to
his
attack
perplexed
disconcerted
andrea
examined
the
mystery
from
all
sides
most
men
especially
those
who
adopt
bold
methods
of
warfare
are
well
acquainted
with
this
perplexity
which
certain
women
excite
by
their
silence
a
servant
threw
open
the
great
doors
leading
to
the
the
marchesa
took
the
arm
of
don
filippo
del
monte
and
led
the
way
said
elena
and
it
seemed
to
andrea
that
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
with
a
certain
abandon
or
was
it
merely
an
illusion
of
his
desire
perhaps
he
continued
in
doubt
and
suspense
but
every
moment
that
passed
drew
him
deeper
within
the
sweet
enchantment
and
with
every
instant
he
became
more
desperately
anxious
to
read
the
mystery
of
this
woman
heart
cousin
said
francesca
pointing
him
to
a
place
at
one
end
of
the
oval
table
between
the
baron
and
the
duchess
of
scerni
with
the
cavaliere
sakumi
as
his
sakumi
sat
between
the
baroness
and
filippo
del
monte
the
marchesa
and
her
husband
occupied
the
two
ends
of
the
table
which
glittered
with
rare
china
silver
crystal
and
flowers
very
few
women
could
compete
with
the
marchesa
in
the
art
of
dinner
giving
she
expended
more
care
and
forethought
in
the
preparation
of
a
menu
than
of
a
toilette
her
exquisite
taste
was
patent
in
every
detail
and
her
word
was
law
in
the
matter
of
elegant
conviviality
her
fantasies
and
her
fashions
were
imitated
on
every
table
of
the
roman
upper
ten
this
winter
for
instance
she
had
introduced
the
fashion
of
hanging
garlands
of
flowers
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
on
the
branches
of
great
candelabras
and
also
that
of
placing
in
front
of
each
guest
among
the
group
of
wine
glasses
a
slender
opalescent
murano
vase
with
a
single
orchid
in
it
a
diabolical
flower
said
elena
muti
taking
up
the
vase
and
examining
the
orchid
which
seemed
all
her
voice
was
of
such
rich
full
that
even
her
most
trivial
remarks
acquired
a
new
significance
a
mysterious
grace
like
that
king
of
phrygia
whose
touch
turned
everything
to
gold
symbolical
flower
in
your
hands
murmured
andrea
gazing
at
his
neighbour
whose
beauty
in
that
attitude
was
really
amazing
she
was
dressed
in
some
delicate
tissue
of
palest
blue
spangled
with
silver
dots
which
glittered
through
antique
burano
lace
of
an
indefinable
tint
of
white
inclining
to
yellow
the
flower
like
something
evil
generated
by
a
malignant
spell
rose
quivering
on
its
slender
stalk
out
of
the
fragile
tube
which
might
have
been
blown
by
some
skilful
artificer
from
a
liquid
gem
i
prefer
roses
observed
elena
replacing
the
orchid
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
very
different
from
her
former
one
of
curiosity
she
then
joined
in
the
general
conversation
donna
francesca
was
speaking
of
the
last
reception
at
the
austrian
embassy
you
see
madame
de
cahen
asked
elena
had
on
a
dress
of
yellow
tulle
covered
with
humming
birds
with
ruby
eyes
a
gorgeous
dancing
and
lady
ouless
did
you
notice
her
in
a
white
gauze
skirt
draped
with
and
little
red
fishes
and
under
the
and
fish
another
skirt
of
gauze
did
you
see
it
a
most
effective
aquarium
and
she
laughed
merrily
andrea
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
sudden
volubility
these
frivolous
and
malicious
things
were
uttered
by
the
same
voice
which
but
a
few
moments
ago
had
stirred
his
soul
to
its
very
depths
they
came
from
the
same
lips
which
in
silence
had
seemed
to
him
like
the
mouth
of
the
medusa
of
leonardo
that
human
flower
of
the
soul
rendered
divine
by
the
fire
of
passion
and
the
anguish
of
death
what
then
was
the
true
essence
of
this
creature
had
she
perception
and
consciousness
of
her
manifold
changes
or
was
she
impenetrable
to
herself
and
shut
from
her
own
mystery
in
her
expression
her
manifestation
of
herself
how
much
was
artificial
and
how
much
spontaneous
the
desire
to
fathom
this
secret
pierced
him
even
through
the
delight
experienced
by
the
proximity
of
the
woman
whom
he
was
beginning
to
love
but
his
wretched
habit
of
analysis
for
ever
prevented
him
losing
sight
of
himself
though
every
time
he
yielded
to
its
temptation
he
was
punished
like
psyche
for
her
curiosity
by
the
swift
withdrawal
of
love
the
frowns
of
the
beloved
object
and
the
cessation
of
all
delights
would
it
not
be
better
to
abandon
oneself
frankly
to
the
first
ineffable
sweetness
of
love
he
saw
elena
in
the
act
of
placing
her
lips
to
a
glass
of
pale
gold
wine
like
liquid
honey
he
selected
from
among
his
own
glasses
the
one
the
servant
had
filled
with
the
same
wine
and
drank
at
the
same
moment
that
she
did
they
replaced
their
glasses
on
the
table
together
the
similarity
of
the
action
made
them
turn
to
one
another
and
the
glance
they
exchanged
inflamed
them
far
more
than
the
wine
are
very
silent
said
elena
affecting
a
lightness
of
tone
which
somewhat
disguised
her
voice
have
the
reputation
of
being
a
brilliant
conversationalist
exert
yourself
therefore
a
little
cousin
cousin
exclaimed
donna
francesca
with
a
comical
air
of
commiseration
while
filippo
del
monte
whispered
something
in
his
ear
andrea
burst
out
laughing
sakumi
we
are
the
silent
members
of
this
party
we
must
wake
up
the
long
narrow
eyes
of
the
asiatic
redder
than
ever
now
that
the
wine
had
kindled
a
deeper
crimson
on
his
high
glittered
with
malice
all
this
time
he
had
done
nothing
but
gaze
at
the
duchess
of
scerni
with
the
ecstatic
look
of
a
in
presence
of
the
divinity
his
broad
flat
face
which
might
have
come
straight
out
of
a
page
of
the
great
classical
humorist
gleamed
red
among
the
chains
of
flowers
like
a
harvest
moon
is
in
love
said
andrea
in
a
low
voice
and
leaning
over
towards
elena
whom
you
have
you
not
observed
it
yet
look
at
him
elena
looked
across
at
him
the
amorous
gaze
of
the
disguised
suddenly
affected
her
with
such
mirth
that
the
japanese
felt
deeply
hurt
and
humiliated
she
said
and
to
console
him
she
detached
a
white
camellia
and
threw
it
across
the
table
to
the
envoy
of
the
rising
sun
some
comparison
in
praise
of
me
the
oriental
carried
the
flower
to
his
lips
with
a
ludicrous
air
of
devotion
ah
sakumi
cried
the
little
baroness
are
unfaithful
to
me
he
stammered
a
few
words
while
his
face
flamed
everybody
laughed
unrestrainedly
as
if
the
foreigner
had
been
invited
solely
to
provide
entertainment
for
the
other
guests
andrea
turned
laughing
towards
elena
her
head
was
raised
and
a
little
thrown
back
and
she
was
gazing
furtively
at
the
young
man
under
her
eyelashes
with
one
of
those
indescribably
feminine
glances
which
seem
to
absorb
almost
one
would
say
drink
in
all
that
is
most
desirable
most
delectable
in
the
man
of
their
choice
the
long
lashes
veiled
the
soft
dark
eyes
which
were
looking
at
him
a
little
and
her
lower
lip
had
a
scarcely
perceptible
tremor
the
full
ray
of
her
glance
seemed
to
rest
upon
his
lips
as
the
most
attractive
point
about
him
and
in
truth
his
mouth
was
very
attractive
pure
and
youthful
in
outline
and
rich
in
colouring
a
little
cruel
when
firmly
closed
it
reminded
one
irresistibly
of
that
portrait
of
an
unknown
gentleman
in
the
borghese
gallery
that
profound
and
mysterious
work
of
art
in
which
the
fascinated
imagination
has
sought
to
recognise
the
features
of
the
divine
cesare
borgia
depicted
by
the
divine
sanzio
as
soon
as
the
lips
parted
in
a
smile
the
resemblance
vanished
and
the
square
even
dazzlingly
white
teeth
lit
up
a
mouth
as
fresh
and
jocund
as
a
child
the
moment
andrea
turned
elena
withdrew
her
eyes
though
not
so
quickly
but
that
the
young
man
caught
the
flash
his
delight
was
so
poignant
that
it
sent
the
blood
flaming
to
his
face
is
attracted
by
me
he
thought
to
himself
inwardly
exulting
in
the
assurance
of
having
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
this
rare
creature
is
a
joy
i
have
never
experienced
before
he
said
to
himself
there
are
certain
glances
from
a
woman
eye
which
a
lover
would
not
exchange
for
anything
else
she
can
offer
him
later
he
who
has
not
seen
that
first
kindle
in
a
limpid
eye
has
never
touched
the
highest
point
of
human
bliss
no
future
moment
can
ever
approach
that
one
the
conversation
around
them
grew
more
animated
and
elena
asked
him
you
staying
the
winter
in
rome
whole
winter
and
longer
was
andrea
reply
to
whom
the
simple
question
seemed
to
open
up
a
promise
then
you
have
set
up
a
home
here
in
the
casa
zuccari
the
trinità
de
monti
lucky
being
lucky
you
live
on
a
spot
i
have
a
great
liking
for
are
quite
right
i
always
think
do
you
that
there
the
most
perfect
essence
of
rome
is
concentrated
as
in
a
cup
true
i
have
hung
up
my
heart
both
catholic
and
pagan
as
an
between
the
obelisk
of
the
trinità
and
the
column
of
the
conception
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
a
sonnet
to
this
suspended
heart
rose
instantly
to
his
lips
but
he
did
not
give
it
utterance
for
he
was
in
no
mood
to
continue
their
conversation
in
this
light
vein
of
false
sentiment
which
broke
the
sweet
spell
she
had
been
weaving
about
him
he
was
silent
therefore
she
too
remained
a
moment
pensive
and
then
threw
herself
with
renewed
vivacity
into
the
general
conversation
prodigal
of
wit
and
laughter
flashing
her
teeth
and
her
at
all
in
turn
francesca
was
retailing
spicily
a
piece
of
gossip
about
the
princess
di
ferentino
on
the
subject
of
a
recent
and
somewhat
risky
adventure
of
hers
with
giovanella
daddi
the
by
the
ferentino
announces
another
charity
bazaar
for
epiphany
said
the
baroness
anybody
know
anything
about
it
yet
am
one
of
the
patronesses
said
elena
muti
you
are
a
most
valuable
patroness
broke
in
don
filippo
del
monte
a
man
of
about
forty
almost
bald
a
keen
sharpener
of
epigrams
whose
face
seemed
a
sort
of
socratic
mask
the
right
eye
was
forever
on
the
move
and
flashed
with
a
thousand
changing
expressions
while
the
left
remained
stationary
and
glazed
behind
the
single
as
if
he
used
the
one
for
expressing
himself
and
the
other
for
seeing
the
may
bazaar
you
brought
in
a
perfect
shower
of
gold
the
may
bazaar
what
a
mad
affair
that
was
exclaimed
the
marchesa
while
the
servants
were
filling
the
glasses
with
iced
champagne
she
added
you
remember
elena
our
stalls
were
close
together
louis
a
drink
five
louis
a
bite
don
filippo
called
in
the
voice
of
a
elena
and
the
marchesa
burst
out
laughing
yes
of
course
filippo
you
cried
the
wares
said
donna
francesca
what
a
pity
you
were
not
there
for
five
louis
you
might
have
eaten
fruit
out
of
which
i
had
had
the
first
bite
and
have
drunk
champagne
out
of
the
hollow
of
elena
hands
for
five
more
scandalous
broke
in
the
baroness
with
a
horrified
grimace
mary
i
like
that
and
did
you
not
sell
cigarettes
that
you
lighted
up
first
yourself
for
a
louis
cried
francesca
through
her
laughter
then
she
became
suddenly
grave
deed
with
a
charitable
object
in
view
is
sacred
she
observed
sententiously
merely
biting
into
fruit
i
collected
at
least
two
hundred
louis
you
andrea
sperelli
turned
to
elena
with
as
constrained
smile
your
human
how
much
did
you
get
oh
two
hundred
and
seventy
louis
everybody
was
full
of
fun
and
laughter
excepting
the
marchese
who
was
old
and
afflicted
with
incurable
deafness
was
padded
and
painted
in
a
word
artificial
from
head
to
foot
he
was
very
like
one
of
the
figures
one
sees
at
a
wax
work
show
from
time
to
time
usually
the
wrong
one
he
would
give
vent
to
a
little
dry
cackling
laugh
like
the
rattle
of
some
rusty
mechanism
inside
him
elena
resumed
must
know
that
after
a
certain
point
in
the
evening
the
price
rose
to
ten
louis
and
at
last
that
lunatic
of
a
galeazzo
secinaro
came
and
offered
me
a
five
hundred
lire
note
if
i
would
dry
my
hands
on
his
great
golden
beard
as
was
ever
the
case
at
the
the
dinner
increased
in
splendour
towards
the
end
for
the
true
luxury
of
the
table
is
shown
in
the
dessert
a
multitude
of
choice
and
exquisite
things
delighting
the
eye
no
less
than
the
palate
were
disposed
with
consummate
art
in
various
crystal
and
dishes
festoons
of
camellias
and
violets
hung
between
the
eighteenth
century
candelabras
round
which
sported
fairies
and
nymphs
and
on
the
more
fairies
and
nymphs
and
all
the
charming
figures
of
the
pastoral
mythology
the
corydons
the
phylises
the
rosalinds
animated
with
their
sylvan
loves
one
of
those
sunny
cytherean
landscapes
originated
by
the
fanciful
imagination
of
antoine
watteau
the
slightly
erotic
excitement
which
is
apt
to
take
hold
upon
the
spirits
at
the
end
of
a
dinner
graced
by
fair
women
and
flowers
betrayed
itself
in
the
tone
of
the
conversations
and
the
reminiscences
of
this
bazaar
at
which
the
ladies
urged
on
by
a
noble
spirit
of
emulation
in
collecting
the
largest
sums
employed
the
most
unheard
of
audacities
to
attract
buyers
did
you
accept
it
asked
andrea
of
the
duchess
sacrificed
my
hands
on
the
altar
of
benevolence
she
replied
louis
more
to
my
account
the
perfumes
of
arabia
will
not
sweeten
this
little
he
laughed
as
he
quoted
lady
macbeth
words
but
in
reality
his
heart
was
sore
with
a
confused
pain
that
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
jealousy
and
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
something
excessive
almost
it
might
be
a
touch
of
the
courtesan
defacing
the
manners
of
the
great
lady
certain
inflections
of
her
voice
certain
tones
of
her
laughter
here
a
gesture
there
an
attitude
certain
glances
exhaled
a
charm
that
was
perhaps
a
trifle
too
aphrodisiac
she
was
besides
somewhat
with
the
visible
favours
of
her
graces
and
the
air
she
breathed
was
continually
surcharged
with
the
desire
she
herself
excited
andrea
heart
swelled
with
bitterness
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
elena
hands
out
of
those
hands
so
delicately
ideally
white
and
transparent
with
their
faint
tracery
of
azure
veins
from
those
rosy
hollowed
palms
wherein
a
chiromancer
would
have
discovered
many
an
intricate
crossing
of
lines
ten
twenty
different
men
had
drunk
at
a
price
he
could
the
heads
of
these
unknown
men
bending
over
her
and
drinking
the
wine
but
secinaro
was
one
of
his
friends
a
great
handsome
jovial
fellow
imperially
bearded
like
a
very
lucius
verus
and
a
most
formidable
rival
to
have
he
felt
as
if
the
dinner
would
never
come
to
an
end
are
such
an
innovator
elena
was
saying
to
donna
francesca
as
she
dipped
her
fingers
into
warm
water
in
a
pale
blue
rimmed
with
silver
do
you
not
revive
the
ancient
fashion
of
having
the
water
offered
to
one
after
dinner
with
a
basin
and
ewer
the
modern
arrangement
is
very
ugly
do
you
not
think
so
sperelli
donna
francesca
rose
every
one
followed
her
example
andrea
with
a
bow
offered
his
arm
to
elena
and
she
looked
at
him
without
smiling
as
she
slowly
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
her
last
words
were
gaily
and
lightly
spoken
but
her
gaze
was
so
grave
and
profound
that
the
young
man
felt
it
sink
into
his
very
soul
you
going
to
the
french
embassy
evening
she
asked
him
you
andrea
asked
in
return
am
am
i
they
smiled
at
one
another
like
two
lovers
down
she
added
as
she
sank
into
a
seat
the
seat
was
far
from
the
fire
with
its
back
to
the
curve
of
a
grand
piano
which
was
partially
draped
in
some
rich
stuff
at
one
end
of
the
divan
a
tall
bronze
crane
held
in
his
beak
a
tray
hanging
by
three
chains
like
one
side
of
a
pair
of
scales
and
on
it
lay
a
new
book
and
a
little
japanese
scimitar
a
the
scabbard
and
hilt
encrusted
with
silver
chrysanthemums
elena
took
up
the
book
which
was
only
half
cut
read
the
title
and
then
replaced
it
on
the
tray
which
swung
to
and
fro
the
scimitar
fell
to
the
ground
as
both
she
and
andrea
stooped
to
pick
it
up
their
hands
met
she
straightened
herself
up
and
examined
the
beautiful
weapon
with
some
curiosity
retaining
it
in
her
hand
while
andrea
talked
about
the
new
novel
insinuating
into
his
remarks
general
arguments
upon
love
and
her
fingers
wandered
absently
over
the
chasing
of
the
weapon
her
polished
nails
seeming
a
repetition
of
the
delicate
gems
that
sparkled
in
her
rings
presently
after
a
pause
elena
said
without
looking
at
him
are
very
young
have
you
often
been
in
love
he
answered
by
another
question
do
you
consider
the
truest
noblest
way
of
love
to
imagine
you
have
discovered
every
aspect
of
the
eternal
feminine
combined
in
one
woman
or
to
run
rapidly
over
the
lips
of
woman
as
you
run
your
fingers
over
the
keys
of
a
piano
till
at
last
you
find
the
sublime
chord
of
harmony
really
can
not
say
and
you
i
either
i
am
unable
to
solve
the
great
problem
of
sentiment
however
by
personal
instinct
i
have
followed
the
latter
plan
and
have
now
i
fear
struck
the
grand
chord
judging
at
least
by
an
inward
premonition
fear
crains
ce
que
he
instinctively
employed
this
language
of
affected
sentiment
to
cloak
his
really
strong
emotion
and
elena
felt
herself
caught
by
his
voice
as
in
a
golden
net
and
drawn
forcibly
out
of
the
life
surrounding
them

the
strident
voice
of
the
bookmaker
stubbs
the
princess
gave
him
an
admonitory
tap
on
the
arm
with
her
red
fan
but
the
joke
seemed
to
amuse
them
hugely
and
the
betting
began
at
once
hearing
the
bursts
of
laughter
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
joined
the
group
in
order
to
share
the
fun
the
news
of
the
approaching
contest
spread
like
lightning
and
soon
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
society
event
me
your
arm
and
let
us
take
a
turn
through
the
rooms
said
elena
to
andrea
sperelli
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
west
room
away
from
the
noisy
crowd
andrea
pressed
her
arm
and
murmured
she
leaned
on
him
stopping
now
and
again
to
reply
to
some
greeting
she
seemed
fatigued
and
was
as
pale
as
the
pearls
of
her
necklace
each
gentleman
addressed
her
with
some
hackneyed
compliment
stupid
they
all
are
it
makes
me
feel
quite
ill
she
said
as
they
turned
she
saw
sakumi
was
following
them
noiselessly
her
camellia
in
his
his
eyes
full
of
yearning
not
daring
to
come
nearer
she
threw
him
a
compassionate
smile
sakumi
you
not
notice
him
before
asked
andrea
we
were
sitting
by
the
piano
he
was
in
the
recess
of
the
window
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
your
hands
when
you
were
playing
with
the
weapon
of
his
native
country
now
reduced
to
being
a
for
a
european
novel
now
do
you
mean
just
now
perhaps
he
was
thinking
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
perform
with
that
little
scimitar
the
chrysanthemums
on
which
seemed
to
blossom
out
of
the
lacquer
and
steel
under
the
touch
of
your
fingers
she
did
not
smile
a
veil
of
sadness
almost
of
suffering
seemed
to
have
fallen
over
her
face
her
eyes
faintly
luminous
under
the
white
lids
seemed
drowned
in
shadow
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
wearily
her
right
arm
hung
straight
and
languid
at
her
side
she
no
longer
held
out
her
hand
to
those
who
greeted
her
she
listened
no
longer
to
their
speeches
is
the
matter
asked
andrea
i
must
go
to
the
van
hueffels
now
take
me
to
francesca
to
say
and
then
come
with
me
down
to
my
carriage
they
returned
to
the
first
where
luigi
gulli
a
young
man
swarthy
and
as
an
arab
who
had
left
his
native
calabria
in
search
of
fortune
was
executing
with
much
feeling
beethoven
sonata
in
c
minor
the
marchesa
a
patroness
of
his
was
standing
near
the
piano
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
keys
by
degrees
the
sweet
and
grave
music
drew
all
these
frivolous
spirits
within
its
magic
circle
like
a
but
irresistible
whirlpool
exclaimed
elena
in
a
tone
of
almost
religious
fervour
as
she
stood
still
and
drew
her
arm
from
andrea
she
had
halted
beside
one
of
the
great
palms
and
extending
her
left
hand
began
very
slowly
to
put
on
her
glove
in
that
attitude
her
whole
figure
continued
by
the
train
seemed
taller
and
more
erect
the
shadow
of
the
palm
veiled
and
so
to
speak
spiritualised
the
pallor
of
her
skin
andrea
gazed
at
her
in
a
kind
of
rapture
increased
by
the
pathos
of
the
music
as
if
drawn
by
the
young
man
impetuous
desire
elena
turned
her
head
a
little
and
smiled
at
him
a
smile
so
subtle
so
spiritual
that
it
seemed
rather
an
emanation
of
the
soul
than
a
movement
of
the
lips
while
her
eyes
remained
sad
and
as
if
lost
in
a
far
away
dream
thus
overshadowed
they
were
verily
the
eyes
of
the
night
such
as
leonardo
da
vinci
might
have
imagined
for
an
allegorical
figure
after
having
seen
lucrezia
crevelli
at
milan
during
the
second
that
the
smile
lasted
andrea
felt
himself
absolutely
alone
with
her
in
the
crowd
an
immense
wave
of
pride
flooded
his
heart
elena
now
prepared
to
put
on
the
other
glove
not
that
one
he
entreated
in
a
low
voice
she
understood
and
left
her
hand
bare
he
was
hoping
to
kiss
that
hand
before
she
left
and
suddenly
he
had
a
vision
of
the
may
bazaar
and
the
men
drinking
champagne
out
of
those
hollowed
palms
and
for
the
second
time
that
night
he
felt
the
keen
stab
of
jealousy
will
go
now
she
said
taking
his
arm
once
more
the
sonata
over
conversation
was
resumed
with
fresh
vigour
three
or
four
new
names
were
announced
amongst
them
that
of
the
princess
issé
who
entered
smiling
with
funny
little
tottering
steps
in
european
dress
her
oval
face
as
white
and
tiny
as
a
little
figurine
a
stir
of
curiosity
ran
round
the
room
francesca
said
elena
taking
leave
of
her
hostess

see
you
so
soon
am
due

the
van

the
marchesa
pressed
a
bunch
of
double
violets
into
her
hand
and
hurried
away
to
receive
the
princess
issé
very
graciously
mary
dyce
in
a
red
dress
slender
and
undulating
as
a
tongue
of
fire
began
to
sing
am
so
tired
murmured
elena
leaning
wearily
on
andrea
arm
ask
for
my
cloak
he
took
her
cloak
from
the
attendant
and
in
helping
her
to
put
it
on
touched
her
shoulder
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
felt
her
shiver
the
words
of
one
of
schumann
songs
was
borne
to
them
on
mary
passionate
soprano
kann
nicht
fassen
nicht
glauben
they
descended
the
stairs
in
silence
a
footman
preceded
them
to
call
the
duchess
carriage
the
stamping
of
the
horses
rang
through
the
echoing
portico
at
every
step
andrea
felt
the
pressure
of
elena
arm
grow
heavier
she
held
her
head
high
and
her
eyes
were
half
closed
you
ascended
these
stairs
my
admiration
followed
you
unknown
to
you
now
as
you
come
down
my
love
accompanies
you
he
said
softly
almost
humbly
faltering
a
little
between
the
two
last
words
she
made
no
reply
but
she
lifted
the
bunch
of
violets
to
her
face
and
inhaled
the
perfume
in
so
doing
the
wide
sleeve
of
her
evening
cloak
slipped
back
over
her
arm
beyond
her
elbow
thrilling
the
young
senses
almost
beyond
control
his
lips
trembled
and
he
with
difficulty
restrained
the
burning
words
that
rose
to
them
the
carriage
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
great
stairway
a
footman
held
open
the
door
madame
van
hueffel
said
the
duchess
to
him
while
andrea
helped
her
in
the
man
left
the
door
and
returned
to
his
seat
beside
the
coachman
the
horses
stamped
striking
out
sparks
from
the
stones
care
cried
elena
holding
out
her
hand
to
the
young
man
her
eyes
and
her
diamonds
flashed
through
the
gloom
to
be
in
there
with
her
in
the
shadow
to
press
my
lips
to
her
satin
neck
under
the
perfumed
fur
of
her
mantle
me
with
you
he
would
like
to
have
cried
but
the
horses
plunged
take
care
elena
repeated
he
kissed
her
hand
pressing
his
lips
to
it
as
if
to
leave
the
mark
of
his
burning
passion
he
closed
the
door
and
the
carriage
rolled
rapidly
away
under
the
porch
and
out
to
the
forum
and
thus
ended
andrea
sperelli
first
meeting
with
the
duchess
of
scerni
chapter
ii
the
gray
deluge
of
democratic
mud
which
swallows
up
so
many
beautiful
and
rare
things
is
likewise
gradually
engulfing
that
particular
class
of
the
old
italian
nobility
in
which
from
generation
to
generation
were
kept
alive
certain
family
traditions
of
eminent
culture
refinement
and
art
to
this
class
which
i
should
be
inclined
to
denominate
arcadian
because
it
shone
with
greatest
splendour
in
the
charming
atmosphere
of
the
eighteenth
century
life
belonged
the
sperelli
urbanity
hellenism
love
of
all
that
was
exquisite
a
predilection
for
studies
an
æsthetic
curiosity
a
passion
for
archæology
and

hereditary
qualities
of
the
house

an
alessandro

brought
in
to
frederic
of
aragon
son
of
ferdinand
king
of
naples
and
brother
to
alfonso
duke
of
calabria
a

containing
the
rude

of
the
old
tuscan
writers
which
lorenzo
de
medici
had
promised
him
at
pisa
in
and
in
concert
with
the
most
erudite
scholars
of
his
time
that
same
alessandro
wrote
a
latin
elegy
on
the
death
of
the
divine

during
the
same
century
in
flanders
in
the
midst
of
all
the
pomp
the
extravagant
elegance
the
almost
fabulous
magnificence
of
the
court
of
charles
the
bold
duke
of
burgundy
where
he
remained
having
allied
himself
with
a
flemish
family
a
son
of
his
named
giusto
learned
painting
under
the
direction
of
gossaert
in
whose
company
he
came
to
italy
in
the
suite
of
philip
of
burgundy
the
ambassador
of
the
emperor
maximilian
to
pope
julius
ii
in
he
settled
in
florence
where
the
chief
branch
of
his
family
continued
to
flourish
and
had
for
his
second
master
piero
di
cosimo
that
jocund
and
facile
painter
and
vivid
and
harmonious
colourist
under
whose
brush
the
pagan
deities
came
to
life
again
this
giusto
was
by
no
means
a
mediocre
artist
but
he
consumed
all
his
forces
in
the
vain
effort
to
reconcile
his
primary
gothic
education
with
the
newly
awakened
spirit
of
the
renaissance
towards
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
sperelli
family
migrated
to
naples
there
a
bartolomeo
sperelli
published
in
an
astrological
treatise
in
a
giovanni
sperelli
wrote
for
the
theatre
an
opera
bouffe
entitled
and
also
a
lyrical
tragedy
entitled
a
carlo
sperelli
brought
out
a
book
of
amatory
verses
in
which
much
licentious
persiflage
was
expressed
with
the
horatian
elegance
so
much
affected
at
that
period
a
better
poet
and
moreover
a
man
of
exquisite
gallantry
was
luigi
sperelli
attached
to
the
court
of
the
king
of
naples
and
his
queen
caroline
his
muse
was
very
charming
and
affected
a
certain
epicurean
melancholy
he
loved
much
and
with
a
fine
discrimination
and
had
innumerable
adventures
some
of
them
famous
as
for
instance
that
with
the
marchesa
di
bugnano
who
poisoned
herself
out
of
jealousy
and
with
the
countess
of
chesterfield
who
died
of
consumption
and
whom
he
mourned
in
a
series
of
odes
sonnets
and
elegies
very
moving
if
perhaps
somewhat
overladen
with
metaphor
count
andrea
sole
heir
to
the
family
carried
on
its
traditions
he
was
in
truth
the
ideal
type
of
the
young
italian
nobleman
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
true
representative
of
a
race
of
chivalrous
gentlemen
and
graceful
artists
the
last
scion
of
an
intellectual
line
he
was
so
to
speak
thoroughly
impregnated
with
art
his
early
youth
nourished
as
it
was
by
the
most
varied
and
profound
studies
promised
wonders
up
to
his
twentieth
year
he
alternated
between
severe
study
and
long
journeys
in
company
with
his
father
and
could
thus
complete
his
extraordinary
æsthetic
education
under
paternal
direction
without
the
restrictions
and
constraints
imposed
by
tutors
and
it
was
to
his
father
that
he
owed
his
taste
for
everything
pertaining
to
art
his
passionate
cult
of
the
beautiful
his
paradoxical
disdain
of
prejudice
and
his
keen
appetite
for
the
sensuous
that
father
who
had
grown
up
in
the
midst
of
the
last
expiring
splendours
of
the
bourbon
court
of
naples
understood
life
on
a
large
scale
was
profoundly
initiated
into
all
the
arts
of
the
voluptuary
combined
with
a
certain
byronic
leaning
towards
fantastic
romanticism
his
marriage
had
occurred
under
tragic
circumstances
the
finale
of
a
mad
passion
then
after
disturbing
and
undermining
the
conjugal
peace
in
every
possible
fashion
he
had
separated
from
his
wife
and
keeping
his
son
always
with
him
had
travelled
about
the
whole
of
europe
andrea
education
had
thus
been
a
living
one
that
is
to
say
derived
less
from
books
than
from
the
study
of
life
as
he
had
seen
it
his
mind
was
corrupted
not
only
by
culture
but
also
by
actual
experiments
and
in
him
curiosity
grew
keener
in
proportion
as
his
knowledge
grew
wider
from
the
beginning
he
had
ever
been
prodigal
of
his
powers
for
the
great
nervous
force
with
which
nature
had
endowed
him
was
inexhaustible
in
providing
him
with
the
treasures
he
dispensed
so
lavishly
but
the
expansion
of
that
energy
caused
in
him
the
destruction
of
another
force
the
moral
one
which
his
own
father
had
not
scrupled
to
repress
in
him
and
he
never
perceived
that
his
whole
life
was
a
steady
retrogression
of
all
his
faculties
of
his
hopes
his
joys
a
species
of
gradual
renunciation
and
that
the
circle
was
slowly
but
inexorably
narrowing
round
him
among
other
fundamental
maxims
his
father
had
given
him
the
following
you
must
your
own
life
as
you
would
any
other
work
of
art
the
life
of
a
man
of
intellect
should
be
of
his
own
designing
herein
lies
the
only
true
superiority
again
never
let
it
cost
what
it
may
lose
the
mastery
over
yourself
even
in
the
most
intoxicating
rapture
of
the
senses
non
is
the
rule
from
which
the
man
of
intellect
should
never
swerve
and
again
regret
is
the
idle
pastime
of
an
unoccupied
mind
the
best
method
therefore
to
avoid
regret
is
to
keep
the
mind
constantly
occupied
with
new
fancies
fresh
sensations
unfortunately
however
these
axioms
which
from
their
ambiguity
might
just
as
easily
be
interpreted
as
lofty
moral
rules
fell
upon
an
nature
that
is
to
say
one
in
which
the
will
power
was
extremely
feeble
another
seed
sown
by
the
paternal
hand
had
borne
evil
fruit
in
spirit
the
seed
of
sophistry
sophistry
said
this
imprudent
teacher
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
human
pleasure
or
pain
therefore
quicken
and
multiply
your
sophisms
and
you
quicken
and
multiply
your
own
pleasure
or
your
own
pain
it
is
possible
that
the
whole
science
of
life
consists
in
obscuring
the
truth
the
word
is
a
very
profound
matter
in
which
inexhaustible
treasure
is
concealed
for
the
man
who
knows
how
to
use
it
the
greeks
who
were
artists
in
words
were
the
most
refined
voluptuaries
of
antiquity
the
sophists
flourished
in
the
greatest
number
during
the
age
of
pericles
the
golden
age
of
pleasure
this
germ
had
found
a
favourable
soil
in
the
unhealthy
culture
of
the
young
man
mind
by
degrees
insincerity
rather
towards
himself
than
towards
others
became
such
a
habit
of
andrea
mind
that
finally
he
was
incapable
of
being
wholly
sincere
or
of
regaining
dominion
over
himself
the
death
of
his
father
left
him
alone
at
the
age
of
twenty
master
of
a
considerable
fortune
separated
from
his
mother
and
at
the
mercy
of
his
passions
and
his
tastes
he
spent
fifteen
months
in
england
his
mother
married
again
and
he
returned
to
rome
from
choice
rome
was
his
passion
not
the
rome
of
the
cæsars
but
the
rome
of
the
popes
not
the
rome
of
the
triumphal
arches
the
forums
the
baths
but
the
rome
of
the
villas
the
fountains
the
churches
he
would
have
given
all
the
colosseums
in
the
world
for
the
villa
medici
the
campo
vaccino
for
the
piazza
di
spagna
the
arch
of
titus
for
the
fountain
of
the
tortoises
the
princely
magnificence
of
the
colonnas
the
dorias
the
barberinis
attracted
him
far
more
than
the
ruins
of
imperial
grandeur
it
was
his
dream
to
possess
a
palace
crowned
by
a
cornice
of
michael
angelo
and
with
frescos
by
the
carracci
like
the
farnese
palace
a
gallery
of
raphaels
titians
and
domenichini
like
the
borghese
a
villa
like
that
of
alessandro
albani
where
deep
shadowy
groves
red
granite
of
the
east
white
marble
from
luni
greek
statues
and
renaissance
pictures
should
weave
an
enchantment
round
some
sumptuous
amour

about
the
end
of

set
up
his
in
the
palazzo
zuccari
near
the
trinità
de
monti
where
the
obelisk
of
pius
vi
marks
with
its
shadow
the
passing
hours
the
whole
of
october
was
devoted
to
furnishing
them
when
the
rooms
were
all
finished
and
decorated
to
his
taste
he
passed
some
days
of
invincible
melancholy
and
loneliness
in
his
new
abode
it
was
a
martin
summer
a
of
the
dead
calmly
sad
and
sweet
in
which
rome
lay
all
golden
like
a
city
of
the
far
east
under
a
sky
diaphanous
as
the
firmament
reflected
in
southern
seas
all
this
languor
of
atmosphere
and
light
in
which
things
seemed
to
lose
their
substance
and
reality
oppressed
the
young
man
with
an
infinite
weariness
an
inexpressible
sense
of
discontent
of
discomfort
of
solitude
emptiness
and
mostly
no
doubt
the
result
of
the
change
of
climate
and
customs
it
was
just
this
that
he
was
entering
upon
a
new
phase
of
life
would
he
find
therein
the
woman
and
the
work
capable
of
dominating
his
heart
and
becoming
an
object
in
life
to
him
within
himself
he
felt
neither
the
conviction
of
power
nor
the
presage
of
fame
or
happiness
though
penetrated
impregnated
with
art
as
yet
he
had
not
produced
anything
remarkable
eager
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
of
love
he
had
never
yet
really
loved
or
really
enjoyed
tortured
by
aspirations
after
an
ideal
and
abhorring
pain
both
by
nature
and
education
he
was
vulnerable
on
every
side
accessible
to
pain
at
every
point
in
the
tumult
of
his
conflicting
inclinations
he
had
lost
all
guiding
and
moral
perception
will
in
abdicating
had
yielded
the
sceptre
to
instinct
and
the
æsthetic
sense
was
substituted
for
the
moral
but
it
was
nevertheless
precisely
to
his
æsthetic
sense
in
him
most
subtle
and
powerful
that
he
owed
a
certain
strength
and
equilibrium
of
mind
so
that
one
might
say
his
existence
was
a
perpetual
struggle
between
contrary
forces
enclosed
within
the
limits
of
that
equilibrium
men
of
intellect
educated
in
the
cult
of
the
beautiful
preserve
a
certain
sense
of
order
even
in
their
worst
depravities
the
conception
of
the
beautiful
is
so
to
speak
the
axis
of
their
being
round
which
all
their
passions
revolve
over
this
sadness

recollection
of

still
floated
like
a
faded
perfume
his
love
for
conny
had
been
a
very
delicate
affair
for
she
was
a
very
sweet
little
creature
she
was
like
one
of
lawrence
creations
with
all
the
dainty
feminine
graces
so
dear
to
that
painter
of
furbelows
and
laces
and
velvets
of
lustrous
eyes
and
pouting
lips

little
countess
of

lively
chattering
never
still
lavish
of
infantile
diminutives
and
silvery
peals
of
laughter
easily
moved
to
sudden
caresses
and
as
sudden
melancholies
and
quick
bursts
of
anger
she
contributed
to
her
share
of
love
a
vast
amount
of
movement
much
variety
and
many
caprices
but
conny
landbrooke
melodious
twitterings
had
left
no
more
mark
on
andrea
heart
than
the
light
musical
echo
left
in
ear
for
a
time
by
some
gay
ritornella
more
than
once
in
some
pensive
hour
of
twilight
melancholy
she
had
said
to
him
with
a
mist
of
tears
before
her
eyes
know
you
do
not
love
me
and
in
truth
he
did
not
love
her
she
did
not
by
any
means
satisfy
his
longings
his
ideal
was
less
northern
in
character
ideally
he
felt
himself
attracted
by
those
courtesans
of
the
sixteenth
century
over
whose
faces
there
would
appear
to
be
drawn
some
indefinable
veil
of
sorcery
some
transparent
mask
of
enchantment
some
divine
nocturnal
spell
the
moment
andrea
set
eyes
on
the
duchess
of
scerni
he
said
to
himself
is
my
ideal
woman
and
his
whole
soul
went
out
to
her

transport
of
joy

the
presentiment

arising

with

said
to

seated
at

a

somehow
he
felt
that
that

set
him
at
a
distance
from

seemed
to
him
cold

instant

she
took
up
the
sardonyx
and
handed
it
to
him
to
look
at
over
her
shoulder
without
turning
round
it
was
really
a
very
beautiful
thing
might
be
the
centaur
copied
by
donatello
andrea
added
and
in
his
heart
with
his
admiration
for
the
work
of
art
there
rose
up
also
a
sincere
admiration
for
the
noble
taste
of
the
lady
who
now
filled
all
his
thoughts
a
rare
creature
both
in
mind
and
body
he
thought
but
the
higher
she
rose
in
his
imagination
the
further
she
seemed
removed
from
him
in
reality
all
the
security
of
the
preceding
evening
was
transformed
into
uneasiness
and
his
first
doubts
he
had
dreamed
too
much
last
night
with
waking
eyes
bathed
in
a
felicity
that
knew
no
bounds
while
the
memory
of
a
gesture
a
smile
a
turn
of
the
head
a
fold
of
her
raiment
held
him
captive
as
in
a
net
now
all
this
imaginary
world
had
tumbled
miserably
about
his
ears
at
the
touch
of
reality
in
elena
eyes
there
had
been
no
sign
of
that
special
greeting
to
which
he
had
so
ardently
looked
forward
she
had
in
no
wise
singled
him
out
from
the
crowd
had
offered
him
no
mark
of
favour
why
not
he
felt
himself
slighted
humiliated
all
these
fatuous
people
irritated
him
he
was
exasperated
by
the
things
which
seemed
to
engross
elena
attention
and
more
particularly
by
filippo
del
monte
who
leaned
towards
her
every
now
and
then
to
whisper
something
to
her
scandal
no
doubt
the
marchesa
now
arrived
cheerful
as
ever
her
laugh
out
of
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
men
who
hastened
to
surround
her
caused
don
filippo
to
turn
round
so
the
trinity
is
complete
he
exclaimed
rising
from
his
seat
andrea
instantly
slipped
into
it
at
elena
muti
side
as
the
subtle
perfume
of
the
violets
reached
him
he
murmured
are
not
those
of
last
night
are
they
she
answered
coldly
in
all
her
varying
moods
changeful
and
caressing
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
there
always
lay
a
hidden
menace
of
rebuff
she
was
often
taken
with
fits
of
cold
restraint
andrea
held
his
tongue
bewildered
your
bids
gentlemen
cried
the
auctioneer
the
bids
rose
higher
antonio

silver
helmet
was
being
hotly
contested
even
the
cavaliere
davila
entered
the
lists
the
very
air
seemed
gradually
to
become
hotter
the
feverish
desire
to
possess
so
beautiful
an
object
seemed
to
spread
like
a
contagion
in
that
year
the
craze
for
and
reached
the
point
of
madness
the
of
the
nobility
and
the
upper
middle
classes
were
crammed
with
curios
every
lady
must
needs
cover
the
cushions
of
her
sofas
and
chairs
with
some
piece
of
church
vestment
and
put
her
roses
into
an
umbrian
ointment
pot
or
a
chalcedony
jar
the
were
the
favourite
and
every
sale
crowded
it
was
the
fashion
for
the
ladies
when
they
dropped
in
anywhere
for
tea
in
the
afternoon
to
enter
with
some
such
remark
as
have
just
come
from
the
sale
of
the
painter
campos
things
tremendous
bidding
such
plaques
i
secured
a
jewel
belonging
to
maria
leczinska
look
the
bidding
continued
fashionable
purchasers
crowded
round
the
table
vieing
with
each
other
in
artistic
and
critical
comparisons
between
the
giottoesque
nativities
and
annunciations
into
this
atmosphere
of
mustiness
and
antiquity
the
ladies
brought
the
perfume
of
their
furs
and
more
especially
of
the
violets
which
each
one
wore
on
her
muff
according
to
the
then
prevailing
charming
fashion
and
their
presence
diffused
a
delicious
air
of
warmth
and
fragrance
outside
the
rain
continued
to
fall
and
the
light
to
fade
here
and
there
a
little
flame
of
gas
struggled
feebly
with
such
daylight
as
remained
going
gone
the
stroke
of
the
hammer
put
lord
humphrey
heathfield
in
possession
of
the
florentine
helmet
the
bidding
then
began
for
smaller
articles
which
passed
in
turn
from
hand
to
hand
down
the
long
table
elena
handled
them
carefully
examined
them
and
placed
them
in
front
of
andrea
without
remark
there
were
enamels
ivories
eighteenth
century
watches
milanese
goldsmiths
work
of
the
time
of
ludovico
the
moor
books
of
hours
inscribed
in
gold
letters
on
pale
blue
vellum
these
precious
things
seemed
to
increase
in
value
under
the
touch
of
elena
fingers
her
little
hands
had
a
faint
tremor
of
eagerness
when
they
came
in
contact
with
some
specially
desirable
object
andrea
watched
them
intently
and
his
imagination
transformed
every
movement
of
her
hands
into
a
caress
why
did
she
place
each
thing
upon
the
table
instead
of
passing
it
to
him
he
forestalled
her
next
time
by
holding
out
his
hand
and
from
thenceforth
the
ivories
the
enamels
the
ornaments
passed
from
the
hands
of
the
lady
to
those
of
her
lover
to
whom
they
communicated
an
ineffable
thrill
of
delight
he
felt
that
thus
some
particle
of
the
charm
of
the
beloved
woman
entered
into
these
objects
just
as
a
portion
of
the
virtue
of
the
magnet
enters
into
the
iron
it
was
in
truth
the
magnetic
sense
of
love
one
of
those
acute
and
profound
sensations
which
are
rarely
felt
but
at
love
beginning
and
which
differing
essentially
from
all
others
seem
to
have
no
physical
or
moral
seat
but
to
exist
in
some
neutral
element
of
our
being
an
element
that
is
intermediate
and
the
nature
of
which
is
unknown
again
is
a
rapture
i
have
never
felt
before
thought
andrea
a
kind
of
torpor
seemed
creeping
over
him
little
by
little
he
was
losing
consciousness
of
time
and
place
recommend
this
clock
to
your
notice
elena
was
saying
to
him
with
a
look
the
full
significance
of
which
he
did
not
for
the
first
moment
understand
it
was
a
small
carved
in
ivory
with
extraordinary
power
and
anatomical
skill
each
jaw
was
furnished
with
a
row
of
diamonds
and
two
rubies
flashed
from
the
deep
on
the
forehead
was
engraved
and
on
the
occiput
it
opened
like
a
box
the
hinging
being
almost
imperceptible
and
the
ticking
inside
lent
an
indescribable
air
of
life
to
the
diminutive
skull
this
sepulchral
jewel
the
offering
of
some
unknown
artist
to
his
mistress
had
doubtless
marked
many
an
hour
of
rapture
and
served
as
a
warning
symbol
to
their
amorous
souls
could
a
lover
wish
for
anything
more
exquisite
and
more
suggestive
she
any
special
reason
for
recommending
this
to
me
thought
andrea
all
his
hopes
reviving
on
the
instant
he
threw
himself
into
the
bidding
with
a
sort
of
fury
two
or
three
others
bid
against
him
notably
giannetto
rutolo
who
being
in
love
with
donna
ippolita
albonico
was
attracted
by
the
dedication
presently
rutolo
and
sperelli
were
left
alone
in
the
contest
the
bidding
rose
higher
than
the
actual
value
of
the
article
which
forced
a
smile
from
the
auctioneer
at
last
vanquished
by
his
determination
giannetto
rutolo
was
silent
going
donna
ippolita
lover
a
little
pale
cried
one
last
sum
sperelli
named
a
higher
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
auctioneer
looked
from
one
to
the
other
then
he
raised
his
hammer
and
slowly
still
looking
at
the
two
going
gone
the
fell
to
the
conte
a
murmur
ran
round
the
room
a
sudden
flood
of
light
burst
through
the
windows
lit
up
the
gleaming
gold
backgrounds
of
the
triptychs
and
played
over
the
sorrowfully
patient
brow
of
the
siennese
madonna
and
the
glittering
steel
scales
on
the
princess
di
ferentino
little
grey
hat
is
the
goblet
coming
on
asked
the
princess
impatiently
her
friends
consulted
the
catalogue
there
was
no
hope
of
the
goblet
for
that
day
the
unusual
amount
of
competition
made
the
sale
go
slowly
there
was
still
a
long
list
of
smaller
articles
cameos
medallions
coins
several
antiquaries
and
prince
stroganow
disputed
each
piece
hotly
the
rest
felt
considerably
disappointed
the
duchess
of
scerni
rose
to
go
sperelli
she
said
shall
see
you
again
this
evening
perhaps
perhaps
do
not
feel
well
is
the
matter
she
turned
away
without
replying
and
took
leave
of
the
others
many
of
them
followed
her
example
and
left
with
her
the
young
men
were
making
fun
of
the
manqué
the
marchesa
laughed
but
the
princess
was
evidently
thoroughly
out
of
temper
the
footmen
waiting
in
the
hall
called
for
the
carriages
as
if
at
the
door
of
a
theatre
or
concert
hall
you
not
coming
on
to
laura
miano
francesca
asked
the
duchess
i
am
going
home
she
waited
on
the
pavement
for
her
brougham
to
come
up
the
rain
was
passing
over
patches
of
blue
were
beginning
to
appear
between
the
great
banks
of
white
cloud
a
shaft
of
sunshine
made
the
wet
flags
glitter
flooded
by
this
pale
rose
splendour
her
magnificent
furs
falling
in
straight
symmetrical
folds
to
her
feet
elena
was
very
beautiful
as
andrea
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
inside
of
her
brougham
all
cosily
lined
with
white
satin
like
a
little
boudoir
with
its
shining
silver
for
the
comfort
of
her
small
feet
his
dream
of
the
preceding
evening
came
back
to
him
to
be
there
with
her
alone
and
feel
the
warm
perfume
of
her
breath
mingling
with
the
violets
behind
the
windows
through
which
one
hardly
sees
the
muddy
streets
the
gray
houses
the
dull
crowd
but
she
only
bowed
slightly
to
him
at
the
door
without
even
a
smile
and
the
next
moment
the
carriage
had
flashed
away
in
the
direction
of
the
palazzo
barberini
leaving
the
young
man
with
a
dim
sense
of
depression
and
heartache
she
only
said
so
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
would
not
be
at
the
palazzo
farnese
that
evening
what
should
he
do
then
the
thought
that
he
might
not
see
her
was
intolerable
already
every
hour
he
passed
far
from
her
weighed
heavily
on
his
spirits
i
then
so
deeply
in
love
with
her
already
he
asked
himself
his
spirit
seemed
imprisoned
within
a
circle
in
which
the
phantoms
of
all
his
sensations
in
presence
of
this
woman
surged
and
wheeled
around
him
suddenly
there
would
emerge
from
this
tangle
of
memory
with
singular
precision
some
phrase
of
hers
an
inflection
of
her
voice
an
attitude
a
glance
the
seat
where
they
had
sat
the
finale
of
the
beethoven
sonata
a
burst
of
melody
from
mary
dyce
the
face
of
the
footman
who
had
held
back
the
anything
that
happened
to
have
caught
his
attention
at
the
moment
and
these
images
obscured
by
their
extreme
vividness
the
actual
life
around
him
he
pleaded
with
her
said
to
her
in
thought
what
he
would
say
to
her
in
reality
by
and
by
arrived
in
his
own
rooms
he
ordered
tea
of
his
installed
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
fictions
of
his
hope
and
his
desire
he
took
the
little
jewelled
skull
out
of
its
case
and
examined
it
carefully
the
tiny
diamond
teeth
flashed
back
at
him
in
the
firelight
and
the
rubies
lit
up
the
shadowy
orbits
behind
the
smooth
ivory
brow
time
pulsed
unceasingly
who
was
the
artist
who
had
contrived
for
his
hippolyta
so
superb
and
bold
a
fantasy
of
death
at
a
period
too
when
the
masters
of
enamelling
had
been
wont
to
ornament
with
tender
idylls
the
little
watches
destined
to
warn
coquette
of
the
time
of
the
rendezvous
in
the
parks
of
watteau
the
modelling
gave
evidence
of
a
masterly
hand
vigorous
and
full
of
admirable
style
altogether
it
was
worthy
of
a
fifteenth
century
artist
as
forcible
as
verrocchio
recommend
this
clock
to
your
consideration
andrea
could
not
help
smiling
a
little
at
elena
words
uttered
in
so
peculiar
a
tone
after
so
cold
a
silence
he
was
assured
that
she
intended
him
to
put
the
construction
upon
her
words
which
he
had
afterwards
done
but
then
why
retire
into
impenetrable
reserve
again
why
take
no
further
notice
of
him
what
ailed
her
andrea
lost
himself
in
a
maze
of
conjecture
nevertheless
the
warm
atmosphere
of
the
room
the
luxurious
chair
the
shaded
lamp
the
fitful
gleams
of
firelight
the
aroma
of
the
tea
all
these
soothing
influences
combined
to
mitigate
his
pain
he
went
on
dreamingly
aimlessly
as
if
wandering
through
a
fantastic
labyrinth
with
him
reverie
sometimes
had
the
effect
of
opium
it
intoxicated
him
i
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
the
signor
conte
that
he
is
expected
at
the
casa
doria
at
seven
observed
his
valet
in
a
subdued
and
discreet
murmur
one
of
his
offices
being
to
jog
his
master
memory
is
ready
he
went
into
an
adjoining
octagonal
room
to
dress
the
most
luxurious
and
comfortable
any
young
man
of
fashion
could
possibly
desire
on
a
great
roman
sarcophagus
transformed
with
much
taste
into
a
toilet
table
were
ranged
a
selection
of
cambric
handkerchiefs
evening
gloves
card
and
cigarette
cases
bottles
of
scent
and
five
or
six
fresh
gardenias
in
separate
little
pale
blue
china
vases
all
these
frivolous
and
fragile
things
on
this
mass
of
stone
on
which
a
funeral
was
sculptured
by
a
masterly
hand
chapter
iv
at
the
casa
doria
speaking
of
one
thing
and
another
the
duchess
angelieri
remarked
seems
that
laura
miano
and
elena
muti
have
quarrelled
giorgio
perhaps
returned
another
lady
laughing
they
say
the
story
began
this
summer
at
lucerne
laura
was
not
at
lucerne
but
her
husband
was
believe
it
is
a
pure
invention
broke
in
the
florentine
countess
donna
bianca
dolcebuono
is
in
paris
now
andrea
heard
it
all
in
spite
of
the
chattering
of
the
little
contessa
starnina
who
sat
at
his
right
hand
and
never
gave
him
a
peace
bianca
dolcebuono
words
did
little
to
ease
the
smart
of
his
wound
at
least
he
would
have
liked
to
know
the
whole
story
but
the
duchess
angelieri
did
not
resume
the
thread
of
her
discourse
and
other
conversations
crossed
and
recrossed
the
table
under
the
great
gorgeous
roses
from
the
villa
pamfili
who
was
this
giorgio
a
former
lover
elena
had
spent
part
of
the
summer
at
lucerne
she
had
just
come
from
paris
after
the
sale
she
had
refused
to
go
to
laura
miano
a
fierce
desire
assailed
him
to
see
her
to
speak
to
her
again
the
invitation
at
the
palazzo
farnese
was
for
ten
half
past
ten
found
him
there
waiting
anxiously
he
waited
long
the
rooms
filled
rapidly
the
dancing
began
in
the
carracci
gallery
the
divinities
of
fashionable
rome
vied
in
beauty
with
the
ariadnes
the
galateas
the
auroras
the
dianas
of
the
frescos
couples
whirled
past
heads
glittering
with
jewels
drooped
or
raised
themselves
bosoms
panted
the
breath
came
fast
through
parted
crimson
lips

sperelli
asked
gabriella
barbarisi
a
girl
brown
as
the
as
she
passed
him
on
the
arm
of
her
partner
fanning
herself
and
smiling
to
show
a
dimple
she
had
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
later
on
andrea
responded
hastily
on
heedless
of
introductions
or
greetings
his
torment
increased
with
every
moment
of
this
fruitless
expectation
and
he
roamed
aimlessly
from
room
to
room
that
made
him
sadly
afraid
that
elena
would
not
come
and
supposing
she
really
did
not
when
was
he
likely
to
see
her
again
donna
bianca
dolcebuono
passed
and
almost
without
knowing
why
he
attached
himself
to
her
side
saying
a
thousand
agreeable
things
to
her
feeling
some
slight
comfort
in
her
society
he
had
the
greatest
desire
to
speak
to
her
about
elena
to
question
her
to
reassure
himself
but
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
languorous
mazurka
and
the
florentine
countess
was
carried
off
by
her
partner
thereupon
andrea
joined
a
group
of
young
men
near
one
of
the
doors
ludovico
barbarisi
the
duke
di
beffi
filippo
del
gallo
and
gino
bomminaco
they
were
watching
the
couples
and
exchanging
observations
not
over
refined
in
quality
one
of
them
turned
to
andrea
as
he
came
up
what
has
become
of
you
this
evening
your
cousin
was
looking
for
you
a
moment
ago
there
she
is
dancing
with
my
brother
now
exclaimed
filippo
del
gallo
albonico
has
come
back
she
is
dancing
with
giannetto
duchess
of
scerni
came
back
last
week
said
ludovico
a
lovely
creature
she
here
have
not
seen
her
yet
andrea
heart
stopped
beating
for
a
moment
fearing
that
something
would
be
said
against
her
by
one
or
other
of
these
malicious
tongues
but
the
passing
of
the
princess
issé
on
the
arm
of
the
danish
minister
diverted
their
attention
nevertheless
his
desire
for
further
knowledge
was
so
intense
that
it
almost
drove
him
to
lead
back
the
conversation
to
the
name
of
his
but
he
was
not
quite
bold
enough
the
mazurka
was
over
the
group
broke
up
is
not
coming
she
is
not
coming
his
secret
anxiety
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
he
half
thought
of
leaving
the
place
altogether
the
contact
of
this
laughing
careless
throng
was
intolerable
as
he
turned
away
he
saw
the
duchess
of
scerni
entering
the
gallery
on
the
arm
of
the
french
ambassador
for
one
instant
their
eyes
met
but
that
one
glance
seemed
to
draw
them
to
each
other
to
penetrate
to
the
very
depths
of
their
souls
both
knew
that
each
had
only
been
looking
for
the
other
and
at
that
moment
there
seemed
to
fall
a
silence
upon
both
hearts
even
in
the
midst
of
the
babel
of
voices
and
all
their
surroundings
to
vanish
and
be
swept
away
by
the
force
of
their
own
absorbing
thought
she
advanced
along
the
frescoed
gallery
where
the
crowd
was
thinnest
her
long
white
train
rippling
like
a
wave
over
the
floor
behind
her
all
white
and
simple
she
passed
slowly
along
turning
from
side
to
side
in
answer
to
the
numerous
greetings
with
an
air
of
manifest
fatigue
and
a
somewhat
strained
smile
which
drew
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
while
her
eyes
looked
larger
than
ever
under
the
low
white
brow
her
extreme
pallor
imparting
to
her
whole
face
a
look
so
ethereal
and
delicate
as
to
be
almost
ghostly
this
was
not
the
same
woman
who
had
sat
beside
him
at
the
ateleta
table
nor
the
one
of
the
sale
rooms
nor
the
one
standing
waiting
for
a
moment
on
the
pavement
of
the
via
sistina
her
beauty
at
this
moment
was
of
ideal
nobility
and
shone
with
additional
splendour
among
all
these
women
heated
with
the
dance
and
restless
in
their
manner
the
men
looked
at
her
and
grew
thoughtful
no
mind
was
so
obtuse
or
empty
that
she
did
not
exercise
a
disturbing
influence
upon
it
inspire
some
vague
and
indefinable
hope
he
whose
heart
was
free
imagined
with
a
thrill
what
such
a
woman
love
would
be
he
who
loved
already
conceived
a
vague
regret
and
dreamed
of
raptures
hitherto
unknown
he
who
bore
a
wound
dealt
by
some
woman
jealousy
or
faithlessness
suddenly
felt
that
he
might
easily
recover
thus
she
advanced
amid
the
homage
of
the
men
enveloped
by
their
gaze
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
she
joined
a
group
of
ladies
who
were
talking
and
fanning
themselves
excitedly
under
the
fresco
of
perseus
turning
phineus
to
stone
they
were
the
princess
di
ferentino
hortensa
massa
the
marchesa
and
bianca
dolcebuono
so
late
asked
the
latter
hesitated
very
much
whether
to
come
at
all
i
do
feel
well
you
look
very
pale
believe
i
am
going
to
have
neuralgia
badly
again
like
last
year
forefend
do
look
at
madame
de
la
boissière
exclaimed
giovanella
daddi
in
her
queer
husky
voice
she
look
like
a
camel
with
a
yellow
wig
vanloo
is
losing
her
head
over
your
cousin
said
hortensa
massa
to
the
princess
as
sophie
vanloo
passed
on
ludovico
barbarisi
arm
heard
her
say
just
now
when
they
passed
me
in
the
mazurka
ne
faites
plus
ça
en
dansant
je
frissonne
the
ladies
laughed
in
chorus
fluttering
their
fans
the
first
notes
of
a
hungarian
waltz
floated
in
from
the
next
room
the
gentlemen
came
to
claim
their
partners
at
last
andrea
was
able
to
offer
elena
his
arm
and
carry
her
off
thought
i
should
have
died
waiting
for
you
if
you
had
not
come
i
should
have
gone
to
find
you
anywhere
when
i
saw
you
come
in
i
could
scarcely
repress
a
cry
this
is
only
the
second
evening
i
have
met
you
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
i
had
loved
you
for
years
the
thought
of
you
and
you
alone
is
now
the
life
of
my
life
he
uttered
his
burning
words
of
love
in
a
low
voice
looking
straight
before
him
and
she
listened
in
a
similar
attitude
apparently
quite
impassive
almost
stony
only
a
sprinkling
of
people
remained
in
the
gallery
between
the
busts
of
the
cæsars
along
the
walls
lamps
with
milky
globes
shaped
like
lilies
shed
an
even
tempered
light
the
profusion
of
palms
and
flowering
plants
gave
the
whole
place
the
look
of
a
sumptuous
conservatory
the
music
floated
through
the
air
under
the
vaulted
roof
and
over
all
this
mythology
like
a
breeze
though
an
enchanted
garden
you
love
me
he
asked
me
if
you
think
you
can
ever
love
me
came
only
for
you
she
returned
slowly
me
that
you
will
love
me
he
repeated
while
every
drop
of
blood
seemed
to
rush
in
a
tumult
of
joy
to
his
heart
she
answered
and
she
looked
into
his
face
with
that
same
look
which
on
the
preceding
evening
had
seemed
to
hold
a
divine
promise
that
ineffable
gaze
which
acts
like
the
velvet
touch
of
a
loving
hand
neither
of
them
spoke
they
listened
to
the
sweet
and
fitful
strains
of
the
music
now
slow
and
faint
as
a
zephyr
now
loud
and
rushing
like
a
sudden
tempest
we
dance
he
asked
with
a
secret
tremor
of
delight
at
the
prospect
of
encircling
her
with
his
arm
she
hesitated
a
moment
before
replying
i
would
rather
not
then
seeing
the
duchess
of
bugnare
her
aunt
entering
the
gallery
with
the
princess
alberoni
and
the
french
ambassadress
she
added
hurriedly
be
prudent
and
leave
me
she
held
out
her
gloved
hand
to
him
and
advanced
alone
to
meet
the
ladies
with
a
light
firm
step
her
long
white
train
lent
an
additional
grace
to
her
figure
the
wide
and
heavy
folds
of
brocade
serving
to
accentuate
the
slenderness
of
her
waist
andrea
as
he
followed
her
with
his
eyes
kept
repeating
her
words
to
himself
came
for
you
alone
i
came
for
you
alone
the
orchestra
suddenly
took
up
the
waltz
measure
with
a
fresh
impetus
and
never
through
all
his
life
did
he
forget
that
music
nor
the
attitude
of
the
woman
he
loved
nor
the
sumptuous
folds
of
the
brocade
trailing
over
the
floor
nor
the
faintest
shadow
on
the
rich
material
nor
one
single
detail
of
that
supreme
moment
chapter
v
elena
left
the
farnese
palace
very
soon
after
this
almost
stealthily
without
taking
leave
of
andrea
or
of
any
one
else
she
had
therefore
not
stayed
more
than
half
an
hour
at
the
ball
her
lover
searched
for
her
through
all
the
rooms
in
vain
the
next
morning
he
sent
a
servant
to
the
palazzo
barberini
to
inquire
after
the
duchess
and
learned
from
him
that
she
was
ill
in
the
evening
he
went
in
person
hoping
to
be
received
but
a
maid
informed
him
that
her
mistress
was
in
great
pain
and
could
see
no
one
on
the
saturday
towards
five
he
came
back
once
more
still
hoping
for
better
luck
he
left
his
house
on
foot
the
evening
was
chill
and
gray
and
a
heavy
leaden
twilight
was
settling
over
the
city
the
lamps
were
already
lighted
round
the
fountain
in
the
piazza
barberini
like
pale
tapers
round
a
funeral
bier
and
the
triton
whether
being
under
repair
or
for
some
other
reason
had
ceased
to
spout
water
down
the
sloping
roadway
came
a
line
of
carts
drawn
by
two
or
three
horses
harnessed
in
single
file
and
bands
of
workmen
returning
home
from
the
new
buildings
a
group
of
these
came
swaying
along
arm
in
arm
singing
a
lewd
song
at
the
pitch
of
their
voices
andrea
stopped
to
let
them
pass
two
or
three
of
the
debased
faces
impressed
themselves
on
his
memory
he
noticed
that
a
carter
had
his
hand
wrapped
in
a
bandage
and
that
another
who
was
kneeling
in
his
cart
had
the
livid
complexion
deep
sunken
eyes
and
convulsively
contracted
mouth
of
a
man
who
has
been
poisoned
the
words
of
the
song
were
mingled
with
guttural
cries
the
cracking
of
whips
the
grinding
of
wheels
the
jingling
of
horse
bells
and
shrill
discordant
laughter
his
mental
depression
increased
he
found
himself
in
a
very
curious
mood
the
sensibility
of
his
nerves
was
so
acute
that
the
most
trivial
impression
conveyed
to
them
by
external
means
assumed
the
gravity
of
a
wound
while
one
fixed
thought
occupied
and
tormented
his
spirit
the
rest
of
his
being
was
left
exposed
to
the
rude
jostling
of
surrounding
circumstances
groups
of
sensations
rushed
with
lightning
rapidity
across
his
mental
field
of
vision
like
the
phantasmagoria
of
a
magic
lantern
startling
and
alarming
him
the
clouds
of
evening
the
form
of
the
triton
surrounded
by
the
cadaverous
lights
this
sudden
descent
of
savage
looking
men
and
huge
animals
these
shouts
and
songs
and
curses
aggravated
his
condition
arousing
a
vague
terror
in
his
heart
a
foreboding
of
disaster
a
closed
carriage
drove
out
of
the
palace
garden
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
lady
bowing
to
him
but
he
failed
to
recognise
her
the
palace
rose
up
before
him
vast
as
some
royal
residence
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
gleamed
with
violet
reflections
a
pale
strip
of
sunset
sky
rested
just
above
it
a
brougham
was
turning
away
from
the
door
i
could
but
see
her
he
thought
to
himself
standing
still
for
a
moment
he
lingered
purposely
to
prolong
his
uncertainty
and
his
hope
shut
up
in
this
immense
edifice
she
seemed
to
him
immeasurably
far
away
lost
to
him
the
brougham
stopped
and
a
gentleman
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
called
it
was
the
duke
of
grimiti
a
near
relative
of
his
to
call
on
the
scerni
asked
the
duke
with
a
significant
smile
answered
andrea
inquire
after
her
she
is
ill
you
know
i
know
i
have
just
come
from
there
she
is
better
she
receive
no
but
she
may
perhaps
receive
you
and
grimiti
laughed
maliciously
through
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
do
understand
andrea
answered
coldly
said
the
duke
says
you
are
high
in
favour
i
heard
it
last
night
at
the
pallavicinis
from
a
lady
a
great
friend
of
yours
give
you
my
word
andrea
turned
on
his
heel
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
cried
the
duke
andrea
entered
the
portico
in
reality
he
was
delighted
and
flattered
that
such
a
report
should
be
circulated
already
grimiti
words
had
suddenly
revived
his
courage
like
a
draught
of
some
cordial
as
he
mounted
the
steps
his
hopes
rose
high
he
waited
for
a
moment
at
the
door
to
allow
his
excitement
to
calm
down
a
little
then
he
rang
the
servant
recognised
him
and
said
at
once
the
signor
conte
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
a
moment
i
will
go
and
inform
he
nodded
assent
and
began
pacing
the
vast
which
seemed
to
echo
the
violent
beating
of
his
heart
hanging
lamps
of
wrought
iron
shed
an
uncertain
light
over
the
stamped
leather
panelling
of
the
walls
the
carved
oak
chests
the
antique
busts
on
pedestals
under
a
magnificently
embroidered
baldachin
blazed
the
ducal
arms
a
unicorn
on
a
field
gules
a
bronze
heaped
with
cards
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
table
and
happening
to
cast
his
eye
over
them
andrea
noticed
the
one
which
grimiti
had
just
left
lying
on
the
top
chance
the
ironical
augury
still
rang
in
his
ears
mademoiselle
now
made
her
appearance
duchess
is
feeling
a
little
better
she
said
think
the
signor
conte
might
see
her
for
a
moment
this
way
if
you
please
she
was
a
woman
past
her
first
youth
rather
thin
and
dressed
in
black
with
a
pair
of
gray
eyes
that
glittered
curiously
under
the
curls
of
her
false
fringe
her
step
and
her
movements
generally
were
light
not
to
say
furtive
as
of
one
who
is
in
the
habit
of
attending
upon
invalids
or
of
executing
secret
orders
way
signor
conte
she
preceded
andrea
though
the
long
flight
of
rooms
the
thick
soft
carpets
deadening
every
sound
and
even
through
the
almost
uncontrollable
tumult
of
his
soul
the
young
man
was
conscious
of
an
instinctive
feeling
of
repulsion
against
her
without
being
able
to
assign
an
adequate
reason
for
it
arrived
in
front
of
a
door
concealed
by
two
pieces
of
tapestry
of
the
medicean
period
bordered
with
deep
red
velvet
she
stopped
will
go
first
and
announce
you
please
to
wait
here
a
voice
from
within
which
he
recognised
as
elena
called
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
coming
thus
unexpectedly
andrea
began
to
tremble
so
violently
that
he
thought
to
himself
am
sure
i
am
going
to
faint
he
had
a
dim
presentiment
of
some
more
than
mortal
happiness
in
store
for
him
which
should
exceed
his
utmost
expectations
his
wildest
dreams
almost
beyond
his
powers
to
support
she
was
there
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
all
perception
of
reality
deserted
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
already
imagined
in
some
picture
some
poem
a
similar
adventure
under
the
circumstances
with
these
identical
surroundings
and
enveloped
in
the
same
mystery
but
of
which
some
fiction
of
his
own
brain
was
the
hero
and
now
by
some
strange
trick
of
the
imagination
the
fictitious
was
confounded
with
the
real
causing
him
an
indescribable
sense
of
confusion
and
bewilderment
on
each
of
the
pieces
of
tapestry
was
a
large
symbolical
figure
silence
and
slumber
two
genii
tall
and
slender
which
might
have
been
designed
by
primaticcio
of
bologna
guarding
the
door
and
he
he
himself
stood
before
the
door
waiting
and
on
the
other
side
of
it
was
his
divine
lady
he
almost
thought
he
could
hear
her
breathe
at
last
mademoiselle
returned
holding
back
the
heavy
draperies
she
smiled
and
in
a
low
voice
said
go
in
she
effaced
herself
and
andrea
entered
the
room
he
noticed
first
of
all
that
the
air
was
very
hot
almost
stifling
and
that
there
was
a
strong
odour
of
chloroform
then
through
the
he
became
aware
of
something
red
the
crimson
of
the
wall
paper
and
the
curtains
of
the
bed
and
then
he
heard
elena
languid
voice
murmuring
you
so
much
for
coming
andrea
i
feel
better
now
he
made
his
way
to
her
with
some
difficulty
being
unable
to
distinguish
things
very
clearly
in
the
half
light
she
smiled
wanly
at
him
from
among
the
pillows
out
of
the
gloom
across
her
forehead
and
round
her
face
like
a
nun
wimple
lay
a
band
of
white
linen
which
was
scarcely
whiter
than
the
cheeks
it
encircled
such
was
her
extreme
pallor
the
outer
angles
of
her
eyelids
were
contracted
by
the
pain
of
her
inflamed
nerves
the
lower
lids
quivering
spasmodically
from
time
to
time
and
the
eyes
were
dewy
and
infinitely
melting
as
if
veiled
by
a
mist
of
unshed
tears
under
the
trembling
lashes
a
flood
of
pity
and
tenderness
swept
over
the
young
man
heart
when
he
came
close
to
her
and
could
see
her
clearly
very
slowly
she
drew
one
hand
from
under
the
coverlet
and
held
it
out
to
him
he
bent
over
it
till
he
half
knelt
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
and
rained
kisses
thick
and
fast
upon
that
burning
fevered
hand
and
the
white
wrist
with
its
hurrying
pulse
elena
my
love
elena
had
closed
her
eyes
as
if
to
resign
herself
more
wholly
to
the
ecstasy
that
penetrated
to
the
most
hidden
fibre
of
her
being
then
she
turned
her
hand
over
that
she
might
feel
those
kisses
on
her
palm
on
each
finger
all
round
her
wrist
on
every
vein
in
every
pore
she
murmured
at
last
opening
her
eyes
again
and
passed
her
languid
hand
softly
over
andrea
hair
her
caress
though
light
was
so
ineffably
tender
that
to
the
soul
it
had
the
effect
of
a
rose
leaf
falling
into
a
full
cup
of
water
his
passion
brimmed
over
his
lips
trembled
under
a
confused
torrent
of
words
which
rose
to
them
but
which
he
could
not
express
he
had
the
violent
and
divine
sensation
as
of
a
new
life
spreading
in
widening
circles
round
him
beyond
all
physical
perception
bliss
said
elena
repeating
her
fond
gesture
and
a
tremor
ran
through
her
whole
person
visible
through
the
coverlet
but
when
andrea
made
as
if
to
take
her
hand
again
she
entreated
not
move
stay
as
you
are
i
like
to
have
you
so
she
gently
pressed
his
head
down
till
his
cheek
lay
against
her
knee
she
gazed
at
him
a
little
still
with
that
caressing
touch
upon
his
head
and
then
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
faint
with
ecstasy
she
murmured
lingering
over
the
syllables
i
love
you
there
was
an
ineffable
seduction
in
the
way
she
pronounced
the
words
so
liquid
so
enthralling
on
a
woman
lips
whispered
her
lover
whose
senses
were
languishing
with
passion
under
the
touch
of
those
hands
the
sound
of
that
caressing
voice
it
again
go
on
speaking
love
you
repeated
elena
noticing
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
lips
and
being
perhaps
aware
of
the
fascination
that
emanated
from
them
while
pronouncing
the
words
with
a
sudden
movement
she
raised
herself
from
the
pillows
and
taking
andrea
head
between
her
two
hands
she
drew
him
to
her
and
their
lips
met
in
a
long
and
passionate
kiss
afterwards
she
fell
back
again
and
lying
with
her
arms
stretched
straight
along
the
coverlet
at
her
sides
she
gazed
at
andrea
with
wide
open
eyes
while
one
by
one
the
great
tears
gathered
slowly
and
silently
rolled
down
her
cheeks
is
it
elena
tell
me
what
is
it
asked
her
lover
clasping
her
hands
and
leaning
over
her
to
kiss
away
the
tears
she
clenched
her
teeth
and
bit
her
lips
to
keep
back
the
sobs
nothing
go
now
leave
me
please
you
shall
see
me
go
now
her
voice
and
her
look
were
so
imploring
that
andrea
obeyed
he
said
and
kissed
her
tenderly
on
the
lips
carrying
away
upon
his
own
the
taste
of
her
salt
tears
love
me
and
do
not
forget
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
seemed
to
hear
her
break
into
sobs
behind
him
he
went
on
a
little
unsteadily
like
a
man
who
is
not
sure
of
his
sight
the
odour
of
chloroform
lingered
in
his
nostrils
like
the
fumes
of
an
intoxicating
vapour
but
with
every
step
he
took
some
virtue
seemed
to
go
out
of
him
to
be
dissipated
in
the
air
the
rooms
lay
empty
and
silent
before
him
appeared
at
a
door
without
any
warning
sound
of
steps
or
rustle
of
garments
like
a
ghost
way
signor
conte
you
will
not
be
able
to
find
your
way
she
smiled
in
an
ambiguous
and
irritating
manner
her
gray
eyes
glittering
with
curiosity
andrea
did
not
speak
once
more
the
presence
of
this
woman
annoyed
and
disturbed
him
arousing
an
undefined
sense
of
repulsion
and
anger
in
him
no
sooner
was
he
outside
the
door
than
he
drew
a
deep
breath
like
a
man
relieved
from
some
heavy
burden
the
gentle
splash
of
the
fountain
came
through
the
trees
broken
now
and
then
by
some
clearer
louder
sound
the
whole
firmament
glittered
with
stars
veiled
here
and
there
by
long
trailing
strips
of
cloud
like
tresses
of
pale
hair
carriage
lamps
flitted
rapidly
hither
and
thither
the
life
of
the
great
city
sent
up
its
breath
into
the
keen
air
bells
were
ringing
far
and
near
at
last
he
had
the
full
consciousness
of
his
overwhelming
felicity
chapter
vi
thus
began
for
them
a
bliss
that
was
full
frenzied
for
ever
changing
and
for
ever
new
a
passion
that
wrapped
them
round
and
rendered
them
oblivious
of
all
that
did
not
minister
immediately
to
their
mutual
delight
a
strange
love
elena

recalling
those

yours
from
the

felt
a
certain
pride
in
the
fact
when
on
that
evening
i
heard
my
name
announced
immediately
after
yours
her
lover
replied
do
know
why
but
i
suddenly
had
the
firm
conviction
that
my

was
bound
to
yours
for
ever
and
they
really
believed
what
they
said
together

illumined
by

wherever
their

strayed
they
left
a
memory
of

the

with
its
wonderful
columns
of

the

the

piercing

with
its
slender

grew
to
know

well
the

of

the
villa

mirrored
in
its
fountains
and
its

all
sweetness
and
grace
where
every
shady
grove
seems
to
harbour
some
noble
idyll
the

cold
and
silent
as
a
church
with
its
avenues
of

and
centenarian
trees
where
in

under

between
the

caryatides
and

symbols
of
immobility
gaze
at
the
immutable

of
the
verdant

and
the
villa

like
a
forest
of

green
spreading
away
in
a
fairy

the
villa

a
little
wild
redolent
of
violets
consecrated
by
the
presence
of

juno
adored
by

in
the
days
when
the
and

have

immortal
had
already
begun
to
tremble
with
the
foreboding
of

and

all
the

of

became
well
acquainted
with
their
love
the

too
the

in
the

where
before

smiled
as
at
her

and
the

room
where
her
image
glided
among
the

and
the

of

the
chamber
of
heliodorus
where
raphael
has
succeeded
in
making
the
dull
walls
throb
and
palpitate
with
life
and
the
apartments
of
the
borgias
where
the
great
fantasia
of

unfolds
its
marvellous
web
of
history
fable
dreams
caprices
and
audacities
and
the
galatea

through
which
is
diffused
an
ineffable
freshness
a
perennial
serenity
of
light
and
grace
and
the

where
the
hermaphrodite
that
gentle
monster
offspring
of
the
loves
of
a
nymph
and
a
extends
his
ambiguous
form
amidst
the
sparkle
of
polished
stone
all
these
unfrequented
abodes
of
beauty
were
well
acquainted
with
them
they
echoed
fervently
the
sublime
cry
of
the
poet
welt
zwar
bist
du
o

thou
art
a
world
in
thyself
oh
rome
but
as
without
love
the
world
would
not
be
the
world
so
rome
without
love
would
not
be
rome
and
the
stairway
of
the
trinità
glorified
by
the
slow
ascension
of
the
day
became
the
stairway
of
felicity
by
the
ascent
of
elena
the
fair
on
her
way
to
the
palazzo
zuccari
times
elena
said
to
him
feeling
for
you
is
so
delicate
so
profound
that
it
becomes
how
shall
i
describe
it
maternal
almost
andrea
laughed
for
she
was
his
senior
by
barely
three
years
at
times
he
rejoined
feel
the
communion
of
our
spirits
to
be
so
chaste
that
i
could
call
you
sister
while
i
kiss
your
hands
these
fallacious
ideas
of
purity
and
loftiness
of
sentiment
were
but
the
reaction
after
more
carnal
delights
when
the
soul
experiences
a
vague
yearning
for
the
ideal
at
such
times
too
the
young
man
aspirations
towards
the
art
he
so
much
loved
were
apt
to
revive
the
desire
to
give
pleasure
to
his
mistress
by
his
literary
or
artistic
efforts
drove
him
to
work
he
accordingly
wrote
and
executed
his
two
engravings
and
for
the
execution
of
his
art
he
chose
by
preference
the
most
difficult
exact
and
incorruptible
vehicles
verse
and
engraving
and
he
aimed
at
adhering
strictly
to
and
reviving
the
traditional
italian
methods
by
going
back
to
the
poets
of
the
and
the
painters
who
were
precursors
of
the
renaissance
his
tendencies
were
essentially
towards
form
his
mind
more
occupied
by
the
expression
of
his
thought
than
the
thought
itself
like
taine
he
considered
it
a
greater
achievement
to
write
three
really
fine
lines
than
to
win
a
pitched
battle
his
of
the
imitated
in
its
structure
poligiano
of
and
contained
lines
of
extraordinary
delicacy
power
and
melody
particularly
in
the
choruses
of
hybrid
monsters
the
centaurs
sirens
and
sphinxes
his
new
tragedy
of
moderate
length
possessed
a
most
singular
charm
written
and
rhymed
though
it
was
on
the
ancient
tuscan
rules
it
might
have
been
conceived
by
an
english
poet
of
elizabeth
time
after
a
story
from
the
and
it
breathed
something
of
the
strange
and
delicious
charm
of
certain
of
the
minor
dramas
of
shakespeare
on
the
frontispiece
of
the
single
copy
the
author
had
signed
his
work

copper
had
greater
attractions
for
him
than
paper
nitric
acid
than
ink
the
than
the
pen
one
of
his
ancestors
before
him
giusto
sperelli
had
tried
his
hand
at
engraving
certain
plates
of
his
executed
about
showed
distinct
evidences
of
the
influence
of
antonio
del
pollajuolo
by
the
depth
and
acidity
so
to
speak
of
the
design
andrea
used
the
rembrandt
method
tratti
and
the
so
much
affected
by
the
english
engravers
of
the
school
of
green
dixon
and
earlom
he
had
formed
himself
on
all
models
had
studied
separately
the
effects
sought
after
by
each
engraver
had
schooled
himself
under
albrecht
dürer
and
parmigianino
marc
antonio
and
holbein
hannibal
carracci
macardell
guido
toschi
and
audran
but
once
his
copper
plate
before
him
his
one
aim
was
to
light
up
by
rembrandtesque
effects
the
elegance
in
design
of
the
florentines
of
the
second
generation
such
as
botticelli
ghirlandajo
and
filippino
lippi
one
of
andrea
most
precious
possessions
was
a
of
finest
silk
in
faded
blue
round
the
border
of
which
circled
the
twelve
signs
of
the
zodiac
each
with
its
appropriate
legend

cancer
leo
virgo
libra
scorpio

in

characters
a
flaming
golden
sun
occupied
the
centre
the
animal
figures
drawn
in
somewhat
archaic
style
as
one
sees
in
mosaics
were
extraordinarily
brilliant
the
whole
thing
was
worthy
to
grace
an
emperor
bed
and
had
in
fact
formed
part
of
the
trousseau
of
bianca
maria
sforza
niece
of
ludovico
the
moor
when
she
espoused
the
emperor
maximilian
one
of
the
engravings
represented
elena
asleep
under
this
celestial
counterpane
the
rounded
limbs
appeared
outlined
under
the
silken
folds
the
head
thrown
carelessly
back
towards
the
edge
of
the
couch
the
hair
rippling
in
a
torrent
to
the
floor
one
arm
hanging
down
the
other
stretched
along
her
side
the
parts
which
were
left
uncovered
the
face
the
neck
the
shoulders
and
the
arms
were
extremely
luminous
and
the
stile
had
reproduced
most
effectively
the
glitter
of
the
embroidery
in
the
and
the
mysterious
quality
of
the
symbols
a
tall
white
hound
famulus
brother
to
the
one
which
lays
its
head
on
the
knee
of
the
countess
of
arundel
in
rubens
picture
stretched
his
muzzle
towards
the
lady
guarding
her
slumbers
and
was
designed
with
much
felicitous
boldness
of
foreshortening
the
background
of
the
room
was
sumptuous
and
shadowy
the
other
engraving
referred
to
an
immense
silver
basin
which
elena
had
inherited
from
her
aunt
flaminia
this
basin
was
historical
and
was
known
as
alexander
bowl
it
had
been
given
to
the
princess
of
bisenti
by
caesar
borgia
on
his
departure
for
france
when
he
went
to
carry
the
papal
bill
of
divorce
and
dispensation
to
louis
xii
the
design
for
the
figures
running
round
it
and
the
two
which
rose
over
the
edge
at
either
side
were
attributed
to
raphael
it
was
called
the
bowl
of
alexander
because
it
purported
to
be
a
reproduction
of
the
prodigious
vessel
out
of
which
the
famous
king
of
macedonia
was
wont
to
drink
at
his
splendid
festivals
groups
of
archers
surrounded
its
base
their
bows
stretched
in
the
admirable
attitudes
of
those
painted
by
raphael
aiming
their
arrows
at
hermes
in
the
fresco
of
that
room
in
the
borghese
decorated
by
john
of
bologna
they
were
in
pursuit
of
a
great
chimera
which
emerged
over
the
edge
of
the
bowl
in
guise
of
a
handle
while
on
the
opposite
side
bounded
the
youthful
bellerophon
his
bow
at
full
stretch
against
the
monster
the
ornaments
of
the
base
and
the
edge
were
of
rare
elegance
the
inside
was
gilded
the
metal
sonorous
as
a
bell
and
weighed
three
hundred
pounds
its
shape
was
extremely
harmonious
never
had
andrea
sperelli
experienced
so
intensely
both
the
delight
and
the
anxiety
of
the
artist
who
watches
the
blind
and
irreparable
action
of
the
acid
never
before
had
he
brought
so
much
patience
to
bear
upon
the
delicate
work
of
the
dry
point
the
fact
was
that
like
lucas
of
leyden
he
was
a
born
engraver
possessed
of
an
admirable
knowledge
or
more
properly
speaking
a
rare
instinct
as
to
the
most
minute
particularity
of
time
and
degree
which
may
aid
in
varying
the
efficacy
of
the
acid
on
copper
it
was
not
only
practice
industry
and
intelligence
but
more
especially
this
inborn
infallible
instinct
which
warned
him
of
the
exact
instant
at
which
the
corrosion
had
proceeded
far
enough
to
give
such
and
such
a
value
to
the
shadows
as
in
the
artist
intention
the
engraving
required
it
was
just
this
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
this
power
of
infusing
an
æsthetic
spirit
into
it
as
it
were
this
mysterious
correspondence
between
the
throb
of
his
pulses
and
the
progressive
gnawing
of
the
acid
that
was
his
pride
his
torment
and
his
joy
in
his
dedication
of
these
works
to
her
elena
felt
herself
deified
by
her
lover
as
was
isotta
di
rimini
by
the
medals
which
sigismondo
malatesta
caused
to
be
struck
in
her
honour
and
yet
on
those
days
when
andrea
was
at
work
she
would
become
moody
and
taciturn
as
if
under
the
influence
of
some
secret
grief
or
she
would
give
way
to
such
sudden
bursts
of
tenderness
mingled
with
tears
and
sobs
that
the
young
man
was
startled
and
not
understanding
her
became
suspicious
one
evening
they
were
returning
on
horseback
from
the
aventine
down
the
via
di
santa
sabina
their
eyes
still
filled
with
a
vision
of
imperial
palaces
flaming
under
the
setting
sun
that
burned
red
through
the
cypresses
and
seemed
to
cover
them
with
golden
dust
they
rode
in
silence
for
elena
seemed
out
of
spirits
and
her
depression
had
communicated
itself
to
her
lover
as
they
passed
the
church
of
santa
sabina
andrea
reined
up
his
horse
you
remember
he
said
some
fowls
picking
about
peacefully
in
the
grass
skurried
away
at
the
barking
of
famulus
the
whole
place
was
as
quiet
and
unassuming
as
the
purlieus
of
a
village
church
but
the
walls
had
that
singular
luminous
glow
which
the
buildings
of
rome
seem
to
give
out
at
hour
elena
drew
up
beside
him
day
how
long
ago
it
seems
now
she
said
with
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
in
truth
the
memory
of
it
had
already
dropped
away
into
the
gulf
of
time
as
if
their
love
had
endured
for
years
elena
words
raised
that
illusion
in
andrea
mind
but
at
the
same
time
a
certain
uneasiness
she
began
recalling
the
details
of
their
visit
to
santa
sabina
one
afternoon
in
january
under
a
prematurely
mild
sun
she
dwelt
insistently
upon
the
most
trivial
incidents
breaking
off
from
time
to
time
as
if
following
a
separate
train
of
thought
distinct
from
the
words
she
uttered
andrea
fancied
he
caught
a
note
of
regret
in
her
voice
yet
what
had
she
to
regret
surely
their
love
had
many
a
sweeter
day
before
it
still
the
spring
had
come
again
to
rome
doubting
and
perplexed
he
ceased
to
listen
to
her
the
horses
went
on
down
the
hill
at
a
walk
side
by
side
snorting
noisily
from
time
to
time
and
putting
their
heads
together
as
if
exchanging
confidences
famulus
sped
on
before
or
bounded
after
them
perpetually
on
the
gallop
you
remember
elena
went
on
you
remember
the
brother
who
came
to
open
the
gates
for
us
when
we
rang
the
bell
yes
how
perfectly
aghast
he
looked
when
he
saw
who
it
was
he
was
such
a
little
little
man
without
any
beard
when
he
went
to
get
the
keys
of
the
church
he
left
us
alone
in
the
vestibule
and
you
kissed
me
do
you
remember
all
those
barrels
in
the
vestibule
and
the
smell
of
wine
while
the
brother
was
explaining
the
legends
carved
on
the
door
and
then
about
the
madonna
of
the
rosary
do
you
remember
his
explanation
made
you
laugh
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
too
and
the
poor
man
was
so
put
out
that
he
would
not
open
his
mouth
again
not
even
to
thank
you
at
the
last
there
was
a
little
pause
then
she
began
again
at
sant
alexio
where
you
would
not
let
me
look
at
the
cupola
through
the
keyhole
how
we
laughed
then
too
renewed
silence
along
the
road
towards
them
came
a
party
of
men
carrying
a
coffin
and
followed
by
a
hired
conveyance
full
of
tearful
relatives
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
jewish
cemetery
it
was
a
grim
and
silent
funeral
the
men
with
their
hooked
noses
and
rapacious
eyes
were
all
as
like
one
another
as
brothers
the
two
horses
separated
to
let
the
procession
pass
keeping
close
to
the
wall
on
either
side
and
the
lovers
looked
at
each
other
across
the
dead
their
spirits
sinking
lower
with
every
moment
when
presently
they
rejoined
one
another
andrea
said
me
what
is
the
matter
what
is
on
your
mind
she
hesitated
a
moment
before
replying
keeping
her
eyes
on
her
neck
and
stroking
it
with
the
end
of
her
riding
whip
irresolute
and
very
pale
have
something
on
your
mind
persisted
the
young
man
well
then
yes
and
i
had
better
tell
you
and
get
it
over
i
am
going
away
next
wednesday
i
do
not
know
for
how
long
perhaps
for
a
long
time
perhaps
for
ever
i
can
not
say
we
must
break
with
one
another
it
is
entirely
my
fault
but
do
not
ask
me
why
do
not
ask
me
anything
i
entreat
you
i
could
not
answer
you
andrea
looked
at
her
incredulously
the
thing
seemed
to
him
so
utterly
impossible
that
it
did
not
affect
him
painfully
course
you
are
only
joking
elena
she
shook
her
head
there
was
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
she
could
not
speak
she
suddenly
set
her
horse
into
a
trot
behind
them
the
bells
of
santa
sabina
and
santa
prisca
began
to
ring
through
the
twilight
they
trotted
on
in
silence
awakening
the
echoes
under
the
arches
and
among
the
temples
all
the
solitary
and
desolate
ruins
on
their
way
they
passed
san
giorgio
in
velabo
on
their
left
which
still
retained
a
gleam
of
rosy
light
on
its
campanile
they
passed
the
roman
forum
the
forum
of
nerva
already
full
of
blue
shadow
like
that
which
hovers
over
the
glaciers
at
night
and
stopped
at
last
at
the
arco
dei
pantani
where
their
grooms
and
carriages
awaited
them
hardly
was
elena
out
of
the
saddle
than
she
held
out
her
hand
to
andrea
without
meeting
his
eyes
she
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
to
be
gone
said
andrea
as
he
helped
her
into
the
carriage
not
this
evening
i
can
not
chapter
vii
the
campagna
stretched
away
before
them
under
an
ideal
light
as
a
landscape
seen
in
dreams
where
the
objects
seem
visible
at
a
great
distance
by
virtue
of
some
inward
irradiation
which
magnifies
their
outlines
the
closed
carriage
rolled
along
smoothly
at
a
brisk
trot
the
walls
of
ancient
patrician
villas
and
dim
slid
past
the
windows
with
a
continuous
and
gentle
motion
great
iron
gateways
came
in
view
from
time
to
time
through
which
you
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
avenue
of
lofty
beech
trees
or
some
verdant
cloister
inhabited
by
antique
statues
or
a
long
green
arcade
pierced
here
and
there
by
a
laughing
ray
of
pale
sunshine
wrapped
in
her
ample
furs
her
veil
drawn
down
her
hands
encased
in
thick
chamois
leather
gloves
elena
sat
and
mutely
watched
the
passing
landscape
andrea
breathed
with
delight
the
subtle
perfume
of
heliotrope
exhaled
by
the
costly
fur
while
he
felt
elena
arm
warm
against
his
own
they
felt
themselves
far
from
the
haunts
of
men
alone
although
from
time
to
time
the
black
carriage
of
a
priest
would
flit
past
them
or
a
drover
on
horseback
or
a
herd
of
cattle
just
before
they
reached
the
bridge
she
said
us
get
out
here
here
in
the
open
country
the
light
was
translucent
and
cold
as
the
waters
of
a
spring
and
when
the
trees
waved
in
the
wind
their
undulation
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
all
the
surrounding
objects
she
clung
close
to
his
arm
stumbling
a
little
on
the
uneven
ground
am
going
away
this
evening
she
said
is
the
last
time
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
in
plaintive
tones
and
with
frequent
pauses
in
between
she
began
to
speak
of
the
necessity
of
her
departure
the
necessity
of
their
rupture
the
wind
wrenched
the
words
from
her
lips
but
she
continued
in
spite
of
it
till
andrea
interrupted
her
by
seizing
her
hand
he
cried
quiet
they
walked
on
struggling
against
the
fierce
gusts
of
wind
go
do
leave
me
i
want
you
want
you
always
he
had
managed
to
unfasten
her
glove
and
laid
hold
of
her
bare
wrist
with
a
caressing
insistent
clasp
that
was
full
of
tormenting
desire
she
threw
him
one
of
those
glances
that
intoxicate
like
wine
they
were
quite
near
the
bridge
now
all
rosy
under
the
setting
sun
the
river
looked
motionless
and
steely
throughout
its
sinuous
length
reeds
swayed
and
shivered
on
the
banks
and
some
stakes
fixed
in
the
clay
of
the
to
fasten
nets
shook
with
the
motion
of
the
water
he
then
endeavoured
to
move
her
by
reminiscences
he
recalled
those
first
days
the
ball
at
the
farnese
palace
a
certain
hunting
party
out
in
the
campagna
their
early
morning
meetings
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
in
front
of
the
jewellers
windows
or
in
the
quiet
and
aristocratic
via
sistina
when
she
came
out
of
the
barberini
palace
followed
by
the
flower
girls
offering
her
baskets
of
roses
you
remember
do
you
remember
that
evening
quite
at
the
beginning
when
i
brought
in
such
a
mass
of
you
were
alone
beside
the
window
reading
you
remember
yes
came
in
you
scarcely
turned
your
head
and
you
spoke
quite
harshly
to
me
what
was
the
matter
i
do
not
know
i
laid
the
flowers
upon
the
tables
and
waited
you
spoke
of
trivial
things
at
first
with
indifference
without
interest
i
thought
to
myself
bitterly
she
is
tired
of
me
already
she
does
not
love
me
but
the
scent
of
the
flowers
was
very
strong
the
room
was
full
of
it
i
can
see
you
now
how
you
suddenly
seized
the
whole
mass
in
your
two
hands
and
buried
your
face
in
it
drinking
in
the
perfume
when
you
lifted
it
again
all
the
blood
seemed
to
have
left
your
face
and
your
eyes
were
swimming
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
on
go
on
said
elena
feverishly
as
she
leaned
over
the
parapet
fascinated
by
the
rushing
waters
below
you
remember
on
the
sofa
i
smothered
you
in
flowers
your
face
your
bosom
your
shoulders
and
you
raised
yourself
out
of
them
every
moment
to
offer
me
your
lips
your
throat
your
half
closed
lids
and
between
your
skin
and
my
lips
i
felt
the
rose
leaves
soft
and
cool
i
kissed
your
throat
and
a
shiver
ran
through
you
and
you
put
out
your
hands
to
keep
me
oh
then
your
head
was
sunk
in
the
cushions
your
breast
hidden
under
the
roses
your
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
nothing
in
this
world
could
be
so
dear
and
sweet
as
the
little
tremor
of
your
white
hands
upon
my
temples
do
you
remember
go
on
he
went
on
with
fervour
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
he
said
elena
her
back
turned
to
the
light
leaned
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
under
them
the
river
flowed
cold
and
silent
long
slender
rushes
like
strands
of
hair
bent
with
every
gust
and
trailed
on
the
surface
of
the
water
he
had
ceased
to
speak
but
they
were
gazing
into
one
another
eyes
and
their
ears
were
filled
with
a
low
continuous
murmur
which
seemed
to
carry
away
part
of
their
life
being
as
if
something
sonorous
had
escaped
from
their
very
brains
and
were
spreading
away
in
waves
of
sound
till
it
filled
the
whole
air
about
them
elena
rose
from
her
stooping
posture
us
go
on
she
said
am
so
thirsty
where
can
we
get
some
water
they
crossed
the
bridge
to
a
little
inn
on
the
other
side
in
front
of
which
some
carters
were
unharnessing
their
horses
with
much
lively
invective
the
setting
sun
lit
up
the
group
of
men
and
beasts
vividly
the
people
at
the
inn
showed
not
the
faintest
sign
of
surprise
at
the
entry
of
the
two
strangers
two
or
three
men
shivering
with
ague
morose
and
jaundiced
were
crouching
round
a
square
brazier
a
was
snoring
in
a
corner
his
empty
pipe
still
between
his
teeth
a
pair
of
haggard
young
vagabonds
were
playing
at
cards
fixing
one
another
in
the
pauses
with
a
look
of
tigerish
eagerness
the
woman
of
the
inn
corpulent
to
obesity
carried
in
her
arms
a
child
which
she
rocked
heavily
to
and
fro
while
elena
drank
the
water
out
of
a
rude
earthenware
mug
the
woman
with
wails
and
plaints
drew
her
attention
to
the
wretched
infant
signora
mia
look
at
it
the
poor
little
creature
was
wasted
to
a
skeleton
its
lips
purple
and
broken
out
the
inside
of
its
mouth
coated
with
a
white
eruption
it
looked
as
if
life
had
abandoned
the
miserable
little
body
leaving
but
a
little
substance
for
fungoid
growths
to
flourish
in
dear
lady
its
hands
are
icy
cold
it
can
not
eat
it
can
not
drink
it
does
not
sleep
any
more
the
mother
broke
into
loud
sobs
the
men
looked
on
with
eyes
full
of
utter
prostration
while
the
sound
of
the
weeping
only
drew
an
impatient
movement
from
the
two
youths
away
come
away
said
andrea
taking
elena
by
the
arm
and
dragging
her
away
after
throwing
a
piece
of
money
on
the
table
they
returned
over
the
bridge
the
river
was
lighted
up
by
the
flames
of
the
dying
day
and
in
the
distance
the
water
looked
smooth
and
glistening
as
if
great
spots
of
oil
or
bitumen
were
floating
on
it
the
campagna
stretching
away
like
an
ocean
of
ruins
was
of
a
uniform
violet
tint
nearer
the
town
the
sky
flushed
a
deep
crimson
little
thing
murmured
elena
in
a
tone
of
heartfelt
compassion
and
pressing
closer
to
andrea
the
wind
had
risen
to
a
gale
a
flock
of
crows
swept
across
the
burning
heavens
very
high
up
croaking
hoarsely
a
sudden
passionate
exaltation
suddenly
filled
the
souls
of
the
two
at
sight
of
this
vast
solitude
something
tragic
and
heroic
seemed
to
enter
into
their
love
and
the
of
their
passion
to
catch
the
blaze
of
the
stormy
sunset
elena
stood
still
can
go
no
further
she
gasped
the
carriage
was
still
at
some
distance
standing
motionless
where
they
had
left
it
little
further
elena
just
a
step
or
two
shall
i
carry
you
then
seized
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
he
burst
out
again
why
was
she
going
away
why
did
she
want
to
break
with
him
surely
their
destinies
were
indissolubly
knit
together
now
he
could
not
live
without
her
without
her
eyes
her
voice
the
constant
thought
of
her
he
was
saturated
through
and
through
with
love
of
her
his
whole
blood
was
on
fire
as
with
some
deadly
poison
why
was
she
running
away
from
him
he
would
hold
her
fast
would
suffocate
her
on
his
heart
first
no
it
could
not
must
not
be
never
elena
listened
with
bent
head
to
meet
the
blast
but
she
did
not
answer
presently
she
raised
her
hand
and
beckoned
to
the
coachman
the
horses
pawed
and
pranced
as
they
started
at
the
porta
pia
she
called
to
the
man
and
entered
the
carriage
with
her
lover
then
she
turned
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
yielded
herself
to
his
desire
and
he
kissed
her
greedily
her
lips
her
brow
her
hair
her
eyes
rapidly
without
giving
himself
time
to
breathe
elena
a
vivid
gleam
of
crimson
light
reflected
from
the
red
brick
houses
penetrated
the
carriage
the
ringing
trot
of
several
horses
came
nearer
along
the
road
leaning
against
her
lover
shoulder
with
ineffable
tenderness
she
said
dear
love
as
she
raised
herself
again
ten
or
twelve
horsemen
passed
to
right
and
left
of
the
carriage
returning
from
a
fox
hunt
one
of
them
the
duke
di
beffi
bent
low
over
his
saddle
to
peer
in
at
the
window
as
he
rode
by
andrea
said
no
more
his
whole
soul
was
weighed
down
by
hopeless
depression
the
first
impulse
of
revolt
over
the
childish
weakness
of
his
nature
almost
led
him
to
give
way
to
tears
he
wanted
to
cast
himself
at
her
feet
to
humble
himself
to
beg
and
entreat
to
move
this
woman
to
pity
by
his
tears
he
felt
giddy
and
confused
a
subtle
sensation
of
cold
seemed
to
grip
the
back
of
his
head
and
penetrate
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
repeated
elena
for
the
last
time
and
the
carriage
stopped
under
the
archway
of
the
porta
pia
to
let
him
get
out
chapter
viii
their
final
farewells
grand
by
elena
desire
did
nothing
towards
dissipating
andrea
suspicions
could
be
her
secret
reasons
for
this
abrupt
departure
he
tried
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
mystery
he
was
oppressed
with
doubt
and
fear
during
the
first
days
the
anguish
of
his
loss
was
so
cruelly
poignant
that
he
thought
he
must
die
of
it
his
jealousy
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
persistent
ardour
of
elena
affection
awoke
now
with
redoubled
vigour
and
the
suspicion
that
a
man
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
enigmatical
affair
increased
his
sufferings
a
hundredfold
sometimes
he
would
be
seized
with
sullen
anger
against
the
absent
woman
a
bitter
rancour
almost
a
desire
for
revenge
as
if
she
had
mystified
and
duped
him
in
order
to
give
herself
to
another
then
again
he
would
feel
that
he
did
not
long
for
her
did
not
love
her
any
more
had
never
loved
her
but
these
fits
of
oblivion
were
but
of
short
duration
the
spring
had
come
again
to
rome
in
a
riot
of
colour
and
sunshine
the
city
of
limestone
and
brick
absorbed
the
light
as
a
parched
forest
the
rain
the
papal
fountains
rose
into
a
limpid
sapphire
sky
the
piazza
di
spagna
was
fragrant
as
a
and
above
the
great
flight
of
steps
alive
with
little
children
the
trinità
de
monti
shone
in
a
blaze
of
gold
excited
by
the
beauty
of
rome
all
that
still
remained
of
elena
fascination
in
his
blood
and
his
spirit
revived
and
he
was
stirred
to
his
very
depths
by
sudden
invincible
pain
by
implacable
inward
tumults
by
indefinable
languors
almost
like
some
strange
renewal
of
his
adolescence
andrea
liaison
with
elena
muti
had
been
perfectly
well
known
as
sooner
or
later
every
adventure
and
every
flirtation
becomes
known
in
roman
society
or
the
society
of
any
other
city
for
the
matter
of
that
precautions
are
useless
to
the
initiated
a
look
a
gesture
a
smile
suffices
to
betray
the
secret
besides
which
in
every
society
there
are
certain
persons
who
make
it
their
business
in
life
to
ferret
out
and
follow
up
the
traces
of
a
love
affair
with
an
assiduity
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
hunter
of
rare
game
they
are
ever
on
the
watch
though
not
apparently
so
never
by
any
chance
miss
a
murmured
word
the
faintest
smile
a
tremor
a
blush
a
lightning
glance
at
balls
or
any
large
gatherings
where
there
is
more
probability
of
imprudence
they
are
ubiquitous
with
ear
stretched
to
catch
a
fragment
of
dialogue
and
eye
keenly
on
the
watch
to
note
a
stolen
a
tremulous
sigh
the
nervous
pressure
of
delicate
fingers
on
a
partner
shoulder
one
such
terrible
trapper
for
example
was
don
filippo
del
monte
but
to
tell
the
truth
elena
muti
did
not
trouble
herself
overmuch
about
what
society
said
of
her
covering
her
every
audacity
with
the
mantle
of
her
beauty
her
wealth
and
her
ancient
name
and
she
went
on
her
way
serenely
surrounded
by
adulation
and
homage
by
reason
of
a
certain
tolerance
which
is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
qualities
of
roman
society
amounting
almost
to
an
article
of
faith
in
any
case
andrea
connection
with
the
duchess
of
scerni
had
instantly
raised
him
enormously
in
the
estimation
of
the
women
an
atmosphere
of
favour
surrounded
him
and
his
successes
became
astonishing
moreover
he
owed
something
to
his
reputation
as
a
mysterious
artist
and
two
sonnets
which
he
wrote
in
the
princess
di
ferentino
album
became
famous
in
which
as
in
an
ambiguous
diptych
he
lauded
in
turn
a
diabolical
and
an
angelic
mouth
the
one
that
destroys
souls
and
the
other
that
sings
he
responded
without
a
moment
hesitation
to
every
advance
no
longer
restrained
by
elena
complete
dominion
over
him
his
energies
returned
to
their
original
state
of
disorder
he
passed
from
one
liaison
to
another
with
incredible
frivolity
carrying
on
several
at
the
same
time
and
weaving
without
scruple
a
great
net
of
deceptions
and
lies
in
which
to
catch
as
much
prey
as
possible
the
habit
of
duplicity
undermined
his
conscience
but
one
instinct
remained
alive
implacably
alive
in
him
the
repugnance
at
all
this
which
attracted
without
holding
him
captive
his
will
as
useless
to
him
now
as
a
sword
of
indifferently
tempered
steel
hung
as
if
at
the
side
of
an
inebriated
or
paralysed
man
one
evening
at
the
dolcebuonos
when
he
had
outstayed
the
rest
of
the
guests
in
the
full
of
flowers
and
still
vibrating
with
a
of
raff
he
had
spoken
of
love
to
bianca
he
did
it
almost
without
thinking
attracted
instinctively
by
the
reflected
charm
of
her
being
a
friend
of
elena
maybe
too
that
the
little
germ
of
sympathy
sown
in
his
heart
by
her
kindly
championship
at
the
dinner
in
the
doria
palace
was
now
bearing
fruit
who
can
say
by
what
mysterious
process
some
contact
whether
spiritual
or
material
between
a
man
and
a
woman
may
generate
and
nourish
in
them
a
sentiment
which
latent
and
unsuspected
for
long
may
suddenly
wake
to
life
through
unforeseen
circumstances
it
is
the
same
phenomenon
so
often
encountered
in
our
mental
world
when
the
germ
of
an
idea
or
a
shadowy
fancy
suddenly
reappears
before
us
after
a
long
interval
of
unconscious
development
as
a
finished
picture
a
complex
thought
the
same
law
governs
all
the
varying
activities
of
our
being
and
the
activities
of
which
we
are
conscious
form
but
a
small
part
of
the
whole
donna
bianca
dolcebuono
was
the
ideal
type
of
florentine
beauty
such
as
ghirlandajo
has
given
us
in
the
portrait
of
giovanna
tornabuoni
at
santa
maria
novella
her
face
was
fair
and
oval
with
a
broad
white
brow
a
sweet
and
expressive
mouth
a
nose
a
trifle
and
eyes
of
that
deep
hazel
so
dear
to
firenzuola
she
was
fond
of
wearing
her
hair
parted
and
arranged
in
full
puffs
half
way
over
her
cheeks
in
the
quaint
old
style
her
name
suited
her
admirably
for
into
the
artificial
life
of
fashionable
society
she
brought
a
great
natural
sweetness
of
temper
much
indulgence
for
the
failings
of
others
courtesy
accorded
impartially
to
high
and
low
and
a
most
melodious
voice
on
hearing
andrea
hackneyed
phrases
she
exclaimed
in
graceful
surprise
have
you
forgotten
elena
so
soon
then
after
a
few
days
of
engaging
hesitation
it
pleased
her
to
yield
to
his
solicitations
and
she
often
spoke
of
elena
to
the
faithless
young
lover
but
with
perfect
frankness
and
without
jealousy
why
did
she
go
away
sooner
than
usual
this
year
she
asked
him
one
day
with
a
smile
have
no
idea
answered
andrea
not
without
a
touch
of
impatience
and
bitterness
it
is
all
over
between
you
quite
over
pity
sake
bianca
let
us
talk
about
ourselves
he
retorted
sharply
the
subject
disturbed
and
irritated
him
she
remained
pensive
for
a
moment
as
if
seeking
to
unravel
some
enigma
then
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
with
a
little
fugitive
shadow
of
melancholy
in
her
eyes
is
love
she
sighed
and
returned
andrea
kisses
in
her
he
seemed
to
possess
all
those
charming
women
of
whom
lorenzo
the
magnificent
sang
on
every
side
we
find
absence
as
men
say
estranges
fancy
ranges
as
the
eye
ranges
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
love
departs
and
is
not
love
as
from
sight
the
eye
departs
even
so
do
hearts
from
hearts
and
at
other
hands
we
prove
fancies
love
as
the
eyes
rove
parted
pleasures
come
again
when
the
summer
came
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
rome
she
said
to
him
without
seeking
to
conceal
her
gentle
emotion
we
meet
again
i
know
you
will
not
love
me
any
more
that
is
love
but
think
of
me
always
as
a
friend
he
did
not
love
her
certainly
nevertheless
during
the
heat
and
tedium
of
the
days
that
followed
certain
cadences
of
that
dulcet
voice
returned
to
him
like
a
haunting
melody
suggesting
visions
of
a
garden
fresh
with
splashing
fountains
where
bianca
wandered
in
company
with
other
fair
women
playing
on
the
viol
and
singing
as
in
a
vignette
of
the
of
polyphilo
and
bianca
passed
and
was
succeeded
by
others
sometimes
two
at
a
time
but
it
was
finally
the
little
ivory
which
had
belonged
to
the
cardinal
immenraet
the
funereal
jewel
dedicated
to
an
unknown
ippolita
that
suggested
to
him
the
caprice
of
tempting
donna
ippolita
albonico
chapter
ix
donna
ippolita
albonico
had
a
great
air
of
princely
nobility
in
her
whole
person
and
bore
some
resemblance
to
maria
maddalena
of
austria
wife
of
cosimo
ii
of
medici
whose
portrait
by
suttermans
is
at
florence
in
the
possession
of
the
corsinis
she
affected
a
sumptuous
style
of
dress
brocades
velvets
laces
and
the
high
medici
collars
which
seemed
the
most
appropriate
setting
to
her
superb
and
imperial
head
one
day
at
the
races
when
seated
beside
her
andrea
was
suddenly
seized
with
the
whim
to
get
her
to
promise
to
come
to
the
palazzo
zuccari
and
receive
the
mysterious
little
clock
dedicated
to
her
namesake
hearing
his
audacious
words
she
frowned
wavering
between
curiosity
and
prudence
but
as
he
nothing
daunted
persevered
in
the
attack
an
irrepressible
smile
quivered
on
her
lips
under
the
shadow
of
her
large
hat
with
its
white
plumes
and
with
her
parasol
as
a
background
she
was
marvellously
handsome
hippolyta
then
you
will
come
i
shall
be
on
the
for
you
all
the
afternoon
from
two
till
evening
is
that
settled
must
be
mad
have
you
to
fear
i
swear
that
i
will
not
rob
your
majesty
of
so
much
as
a
glove
you
shall
remain
seated
as
on
a
throne
as
befits
your
regal
state
and
even
in
taking
a
cup
of
tea
you
shall
not
lay
aside
the
invisible
sceptre
you
carry
for
ever
in
your
imperial
right
hand
on
these
conditions
is
the
grace
accorded
but
she
smiled
nevertheless
flattered
by
this
exaltation
of
the
regal
aspect
of
her
beauty
wherein
she
gloried
and
sperelli
continued
to
tempt
her
always
in
a
tone
of
banter
or
entreaty
but
adding
to
the
seduction
of
his
voice
a
gaze
so
subtle
so
penetrating
and
disturbing
that
at
length
donna
ippolita
half
offended
and
blushing
faintly
said
to
him
will
not
have
you
look
at
me
like
that
few
persons
besides
themselves
remained
upon
the
stand
ladies
and
gentlemen
strolled
up
and
down
across
the
grass
along
the
barrier
or
surrounded
the
victorious
horse
or
the
yelling
bookmakers
under
the
inconstant
rays
of
the
sun
that
came
and
went
between
the
floating
archipelago
of
clouds
us
go
down
she
said
unaware
of
giannetto
rutolo
leaning
with
watchful
eyes
upon
the
railing
of
the
staircase
as
they
passed
him
sperelli
called
back
over
his
shoulder
marchese
see
you
again
soon
our
race
is
on
directly
rutolo
bowed
profoundly
to
donna
ippolita
and
a
deep
flush
rose
suddenly
to
his
face
he
seemed
to
have
caught
a
touch
of
derision
in
sperelli
greeting
leaning
on
the
railing
he
followed
the
retreating
couple
with
hungry
eyes
he
was
obviously
suffering
be
on
your
guard
said
the
contessa
di
lucoli
with
a
malicious
laugh
as
she
passed
down
the
stairs
on
the
arm
of
don
filippo
del
monte
the
blow
struck
home
donna
ippolita
and
the
conte
having
penetrated
as
far
as
the
umpire
stand
were
now
retracing
their
steps
the
lady
held
her
sunshade
over
her
shoulder
twirling
the
handle
languidly
in
her
fingers
the
white
cupola
stood
out
round
her
head
like
a
halo
and
the
lace
frills
rose
and
fluttered
incessantly
within
this
revolving
circle
she
laughed
from
time
to
time
at
what
her
companion
said
and
a
delicate
flush
stained
the
noble
pallor
of
her
face
sometimes
they
would
both
stand
still
under
pretext
of
examining
the
horses
now
entering
the
giannetto
turned
his
upon
the
two
his
hands
trembled
visibly
every
smile
every
movement
every
glance
of
ippolita
was
a
in
his
heart
when
he
dropped
his
glass
he
was
deadly
pale
he
had
surprised
a
look
in
the
eyes
that
met
sperelli
which
he
knew
full
well
of
old
everything
seemed
crumbling
to
ruins
around
him
the
love
of
years
was
over
irrevocably
lost
slain
by
that
glance
the
sun
was
the
sun
no
longer
life
was
not
life
any
more
the
grand
stand
was
rapidly
refilling
the
signal
for
the
third
race
was
about
to
be
given
the
ladies
stood
up
on
their
seats
a
murmur
ran
along
the
tiers
like
a
breeze
over
a
sloping
garden
the
bell
rang
the
horses
started
like
a
flight
of
arrows
shall
ride
in
your
honour
donna
ippolita
said
andrea
sperelli
as
he
look
leave
of
her
to
get
ready
for
the
next
race
which
was
for
gentlemen
riders
hippolyta
semper
she
pressed
his
hand
warmly
for
luck
never
remembering
that
giannetto
rutolo
was
also
among
the
competitors
when
a
moment
later
she
noticed
him
going
down
the
stairs
pale
and
alone
the
unconcealed
cruelty
of
indifference
shone
in
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
the
old
love
had
fallen
away
from
her
like
a
useless
garment
and
had
given
place
to
the
new
this
man
was
nothing
to
her
had
no
claims
of
any
kind
upon
her
now
that
she
no
longer
loved
him
it
is
inconceivable
how
quickly
a
woman
regains
entire
possession
of
her
own
heart
once
she
has
ceased
to
love
a
man
has
stolen
her
from
me
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
jockey
club
tent
and
the
grass
seemed
to
give
beneath
his
feet
like
sand
at
a
little
distance
in
front
of
him
walked
the
other
with
a
firm
and
elastic
step
in
his
long
gray
overcoat
his
tall
and
shapely
figure
had
that
peculiar
and
inimitable
air
of
elegance
which
only
breeding
can
give
he
was
smoking
and
giannetto
rutolo
coming
up
behind
him
caught
the
delicate
aroma
of
the
cigarette
with
every
puff
causing
him
an
intolerable
nausea
as
if
it
had
been
poison
the
duke
di
beffi
and
paolo
caligaro
were
at
the
entrance
already
in
racing
dress
the
duke
was
making
gymnastic
movements
to
test
the
elasticity
of
his
leather
breeches
and
the
strength
of
his
knees
little
caligaro
was
execrating
last
night
rain
which
had
made
the
ground
heavy
have
a
very
good
chance
with
i
consider
he
remarked
to
sperelli
when
he
came
up
giannetto
rutolo
heard
this
forecast
with
a
bitter
pang
he
had
founded
a
vague
hope
on
the
event
of
his
own
victory
he
represented
to
himself
the
advantage
he
might
gain
over
his
enemy
by
a
victorious
race
and
a
successful
duel
as
he
changed
his
clothes
his
every
movement
betrayed
his
preoccupation
is
a
man
who
before
getting
on
horseback
sees
the
grave
open
before
him
said
the
duke
laying
his
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
with
a
air
homo
andrea
sperelli
who
felt
in
the
best
of
spirits
at
that
moment
gave
vent
to
one
of
those
frank
bursts
of
laughter
which
were
the
most
engaging
trait
of
his
youth
are
you
laughing
at
demanded
rutolo
lividly
pale
glaring
at
him
from
under
frowning
brows
seems
to
me
my
dear
fellow
returned
sperelli
unmoved
you
are
a
little
out
of
temper
if
i
am
are
at
liberty
to
think
what
you
like
about
my
laughing
i
think
it
is
idiotic
sperelli
bounded
to
his
feet
and
made
a
stride
forward
with
uplifted
whip
by
a
miracle
paolo
caligaro
managed
to
catch
his
arm
violent
words
followed
don
marc
antonio
spada
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
heard
the
altercation
enough
boys
you
both
know
what
you
have
to
do
you
got
to
ride
now
the
two
adversaries
finished
their
dressing
in
silence
and
then
went
out
the
news
of
the
quarrel
had
already
spread
through
the
enclosure
and
up
to
the
grand
stand
increasing
the
excitement
of
the
race
with
a
refinement
of
perfidy
the
contessa
di
lucoli
repeated
it
to
donna
ippolita
the
latter
gave
no
sign
of
inward
perturbation
am
sorry
to
hear
that
was
her
only
comment
thought
they
were
friends
the
crowd
surged
round
the
bookmakers
the
horse
of
the
conte
and
that
of
the
marchese
rutolo
were
the
favourites
then
came
the
duke
di
beffi
and
however
the
best
judges
had
not
overmuch
confidence
in
the
two
first
thinking
that
the
nervous
excitement
of
their
riders
must
inevitably
tell
upon
the
racing
but
andrea
sperelli
was
perfectly
calm
not
to
say
gay
his
sense
of
superiority
over
his
rival
gave
him
assurance
moreover
his
romantic
taste
for
any
adventure
savouring
of
peril
inherited
from
his
byronic
father
shed
a
halo
of
glory
round
the
situation
and
all
the
inborn
generosity
of
his
young
blood
awoke
at
the
prospect
of
danger
with
a
beating
heart
he
went
forward
to
meet
his
horse
as
to
a
friend
who
was
bringing
him
the
news
of
some
great
good
fortune
he
stroked
its
nose
fondly
and
the
glances
of
the
animal
eye
an
eye
that
flashed
with
the
inextinguishable
fire
of
noblest
breeding
intoxicated
him
like
a
woman
magnetic
gaze
he
whispered
as
he
caressed
the
horse
is
a
great
day
we
must
win
his
trainer
a
little
man
who
was
engaged
in
scrutinising
the
other
horses
as
they
were
led
past
by
their
grooms
answered
in
his
rough
husky
voice
no
doubt
but
you
will
miching
mallecho
was
a
superb
bay
from
the
stables
of
the
baron
de
soubeyran
and
combined
extreme
elegance
of
build
with
extraordinary
strength
of
muscle
his
fine
and
shining
coat
under
which
the
tracery
of
veins
was
distinctly
visible
on
chest
and
flank
seemed
almost
to
exhale
a
fiery
vapour
so
intense
was
the
creature
vitality
a
splendid
jumper
he
had
often
carried
his
master
in
the
over
every
obstacle
of
the
roman
countryside
irrespective
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
never
refusing
the
highest
gate
the
most
forbidding
wall
for
ever
at
the
tail
of
the
hounds
a
word
from
his
rider
had
more
effect
on
him
than
the
spur
a
caress
made
him
quiver
with
delight
before
mounting
andrea
carefully
examined
every
strap
and
buckle
then
with
a
smile
he
vaulted
into
the
saddle
as
he
watched
his
master
move
away
the
trainer
expressed
his
confidence
in
an
eloquent
gesture
a
crowd
of
bettors
pressed
round
the
indicator
andrea
felt
that
every
eye
was
upon
him
gazing
eagerly
at
the
stand
to
the
right
he
tried
to
catch
sight
of
ippolita
albonico
but
could
distinguish
no
one
among
the
multitude
of
ladies
the
marchesa
who
had
heard
of
the
quarrel
made
him
a
sign
of
reproof
from
afar
is
the
betting
on
mallecho
he
asked
of
ludovico
barbarisi
as
he
moved
towards
the
he
reflected
calmly
on
the
means
he
would
employ
for
winning
and
considered
his
three
rivals
critically
calculating
the
strength
and
science
of
each
of
them
paolo
caligaro
was
a
tricky
devil
as
thoroughly
versed
in
all
the
knavery
of
the
stable
as
any
jockey
but
carbonilla
although
fast
had
little
staying
power
the
duke
di
beffi
a
rider
of
the
école
style
who
had
come
off
victorious
in
more
than
one
race
in
england
was
mounted
on
an
animal
of
uncertain
temper
which
would
probably
refuse
some
of
the
jumps
giannetto
rutolo
on
the
contrary
was
riding
a
and
horse
but
though
he
was
a
very
capable
rider
he
was
too
impetuous
moreover
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
taken
part
in
a
public
race
besides
he
must
be
in
a
terrible
state
of
nervous
irritation
as
was
apparent
from
numerous
signs
as
he
looked
at
him
andrea
thought
to
himself
have
no
doubt
that
my
victory
would
influence
the
course
of
the
duel
in
both
instances
he
will
lose
his
head
it
behoves
me
to
keep
calm
on
both
fields
then
wonder
what
donna
ippolita
feels
about
it
there
seemed
to
be
an
unusual
silence
round
about
him
with
his
eye
he
measured
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
first
hurdle
he
noticed
a
shining
stone
on
the
course
he
observed
that
rutolo
was
watching
him
and
a
tremor
ran
through
him
from
head
to
foot
the
bell
gave
the
signal
but
brummel
was
off
too
soon
and
the
start
was
no
good
the
second
time
too
they
made
a
false
start
and
again
through
brummel
fault
sperelli
and
the
duke
exchanged
a
furtive
smile
the
third
start
was
successful
brummel
instantly
detached
himself
from
the
group
and
swept
along
by
the
palings
the
other
three
horses
followed
abreast
for
a
moment
or
so
and
cleared
the
first
hurdle
and
then
the
second
very
well
each
of
the
three
riders
played
a
different
game
the
duke
di
beffi
tried
to
keep
with
the
group
so
that
satirist
might
be
induced
to
follow
the
example
of
the
other
horses
at
the
obstacles
caligaro
moderated
carbonilla
pace
in
order
to
save
up
her
strength
for
the
last
five
hundred
yards
sperelli
increased
his
speed
gradually
with
the
intention
of
catching
up
with
his
adversary
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
most
difficult
obstacle
in
effect
mallecho
soon
distanced
his
two
companions
and
began
to
press
brummel
very
closely
rutolo
heard
the
rapidly
approaching
behind
him
and
was
seized
with
such
nervousness
that
his
sight
seemed
to
fail
him
everything
swam
before
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
swooning
he
made
a
frightful
effort
to
keep
his
spurs
at
his
horse
sides
overcome
by
terror
at
the
thought
that
his
senses
might
leave
him
there
was
a
muffled
roar
in
his
ears
and
through
that
roar
he
caught
the
hard
clear
sound
of
andrea
sperelli
more
susceptible
to
the
voice
than
any
other
mode
of
urging
mallecho
simply
devoured
the
intervening
space
he
was
not
more
than
two
or
three
lengths
behind
brummel
was
on
the
point
of
joining
of
passing
him
a
high
barrier
intersected
the
course
rutolo
actually
did
not
see
it
having
lost
all
sense
of
his
surroundings
and
only
preserved
a
furious
instinct
to
remain
glued
to
his
horse
and
force
it
along
never
mind
how
brummel
jumped
but
receiving
no
aid
from
his
rider
caught
his
hind
legs
against
the
barrier
and
came
down
so
awkwardly
on
the
other
side
that
the
rider
lost
his
stirrups
without
however
coming
out
of
the
saddle
and
he
continued
to
run
andrea
sperelli
now
took
the
lead
giannetto
rutolo
without
having
recovered
his
stirrups
being
second
with
paolo
caligaro
close
upon
his
heels
the
duke
retarded
by
a
refusal
from
satirist
came
last
in
this
order
they
passed
the
grand
stand
they
heard
a
confused
clamour
but
it
soon
died
away
the
spectators
held
their
breath
in
suspense
from
time
to
time
somebody
would
remark
aloud
on
the
various
incidents
of
the
running
at
every
change
in
the
order
of
the
horses
numerous
exclamations
sounded
through
the
continuous
murmur
and
the
ladies
thrilled
visibly
donna
ippolita
albonico
mounted
on
a
seat
with
her
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
her
husband
who
stood
below
her
watched
the
race
with
marvellous
and
without
a
trace
of
apparent
emotion
unless
the
compression
of
her
lips
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
furrow
between
her
brows
might
have
revealed
the
effort
to
an
observant
eye
at
a
certain
moment
however
she
drew
her
hands
away
from
her
shoulder
fearful
of
betraying
herself
by
some
involuntary
movement
is
down
announced
the
contessa
di
lucoli
in
a
loud
voice
mallecho
in
jumping
had
slipped
on
the
wet
grass
and
come
down
on
his
knees
but
recovered
himself
in
an
instant
andrea
had
gone
over
his
head
but
was
none
the
worse
and
with
lightning
rapidity
was
back
in
the
saddle
as
rutolo
and
caligaro
came
up
with
him
brummel
performed
prodigies
in
spite
of
the
wounded
leg
and
showed
the
quality
of
his
blood
carbonilla
was
at
last
putting
out
all
her
speed
guided
with
consummate
skill
by
her
rider
there
were
still
about
eight
hundred
yards
to
the
winning
post
sperelli
saw
victory
escaping
him
and
gathered
up
all
his
forces
to
grasp
it
again
standing
in
the
stirrups
bent
low
over
his
neck
he
uttered
from
time
to
time
that
short
sharp
ringing
word
which
always
acted
so
effectively
upon
the
noble
creature
while
brummel
and
carbonilla
fatigued
by
the
heaviness
of
the
ground
began
to
lose
the
pace
mallecho
steadily
increased
the
vehemence
of
his
rush
and
had
nearly
reconquered
his
former
position
scenting
victory
already
with
his
fiery
nostrils
flying
over
the
last
obstacle
he
passed
brummel
his
head
was
level
with
carbonilla
shoulder
a
hundred
yards
from
the
post
he
skirted
the
barrier
on
on
leaving
caligaro
black
mare
ten
lengths
behind
the
bell
rang
a
furious
clapping
of
hands
like
the
pelting
of
and
then
a
dull
roar
spread
through
the
great
crowd
on
the
green
sward
under
the
flood
of
brilliant
sunshine
as
he
entered
the
enclosure
andrea
sperelli
thought
to
himself
is
with
me
but
how
will
it
be
and
feeling
the
breath
of
triumph
surge
round
him
a
vague
sense
of
resentment
rose
up
in
him
against
the
possibilities
of
the
morrow
he
would
have
preferred
to
face
it
and
get
it
over
that
he
might
enjoy
a
double
victory
and
then
taste
the
fruit
offered
to
him
by
the
hand
of
ippolita
albonico
he
was
possessed
for
the
moment
by
that
inexplicable
intoxication
which
results
with
certain
men
of
intellect
from
the
exercise
of
their
physical
powers
the
experience
of
their
courage
and
the
revelation
of
their
inherent
brutality
the
substratum
of
primitive
ferocity
which
exists
at
the
bottom
of
most
of
us
rushes
to
the
surface
on
occasion
with
curious
vehemence
and
under
the
varnish
of
modern
civilisation
our
hearts
swell
sometimes
with
a
nameless
sanguinary
fury
and
visions
of
carnage
rise
up
before
us
inhaling
the
hot
and
acrid
exhalations
of
his
horse
andrea
sperelli
felt
that
none
of
the
delicate
perfumes
affected
by
him
up
till
now
had
ever
afforded
him
such
intense
enjoyment
he
had
scarcely
quitted
the
saddle
before
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
friends
of
both
sexes
eager
to
congratulate
him
mallecho
breathing
hard
smoking
and
covered
with
foam
snorted
and
stretched
his
neck
shaking
the
bridle
his
sides
rose
and
fell
with
a
deep
continuous
movement
as
if
they
must
burst
his
muscles
vibrated
under
skin
like
a
after
the
shot
his
eyes
dilated
and
bloodshot
had
the
cruel
glare
of
those
of
a
beast
of
prey
his
coat
now
showing
great
patches
of
darker
colour
ran
down
with
rivulets
of
perspiration
the
incessant
trembling
of
his
whole
body
was
pitiable
to
see
like
the
suffering
of
a
human
being
fellow
murmured
one
of
the
ladies
andrea
examined
his
knees
to
see
if
he
had
taken
any
hurt
from
his
fall
they
were
sound
then
patting
him
softly
on
the
neck
he
said
in
an
indefinable
tone
of
gentleness
mallecho
go
and
he
followed
him
with
his
eyes
till
he
disappeared
directly
he
had
changed
his
clothes
he
went
in
search
of
ludovico
barbarisi
and
the
baron
di
santa
margherita
both
instantly
accepted
the
office
of
arranging
preliminaries
with
rutolo
he
begged
them
to
hasten
matters
as
much
as
possible
it
all
by
this
evening
by
one
i
absolutely
must
be
free
but
let
me
sleep
till
nine
morning
i
dine
with
the
ferentinos
then
i
shall
look
in
at
the
palazzo
giustiniani
and
after
that
i
shall
go
to
the
club
but
it
will
be
late
you
will
know
where
to
find
me
many
thanks
my
dear
fellows
and
he
repaired
to
the
grand
stand
but
avoided
approaching
donna
ippolita
at
once
he
smiled
feeling
every
feminine
eye
upon
him
many
a
fair
hand
was
held
out
many
a
sweet
voice
called
him
familiarly
some
of
them
even
a
little
ostentatiously
the
ladies
who
had
bet
upon
his
horses
told
him
the
amount
of
their
winnings
others
asked
curiously
if
he
were
really
going
to
fight
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
one
day
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
adventurous
glory
he
had
come
out
victor
in
a
record
race
had
gained
the
graces
of
a
new
love
magnificent
and
serene
as
a
venetian
dogaressa
had
provoked
a
man
to
mortal
combat
and
now
was
passing
calm
and
courteous
but
neither
more
so
nor
less
than
usual
amid
the
openly
adoring
smiles
of
all
these
fair
women
the
conquering
hero
comes
cried
ippolita
husband
with
outstretched
hand
and
pressing
andrea
with
unusual
warmth
indeed
quite
a
hero
echoed
donna
ippolita
in
the
superficial
tone
of
necessary
compliment
affecting
ignorance
of
the
real
drama
sperelli
bowed
and
passed
on
feeling
strangely
embarrassed
by
albonico
excessive
friendliness
a
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
he
was
grateful
to
him
for
having
provoked
a
quarrel
with
his
wife
lover
and
the
cowardice
of
the
man
brought
a
supercilious
smile
to
his
lips
returning
from
the
races
on
the
prince
di
ferentino
mail
coach
he
espied
giannetto
rutolo
tearing
back
to
rome
in
a
little
trap
behind
a
great
roan
bending
forward
with
head
down
a
cigar
between
his
teeth
and
utterly
regardless
of
the
injunctions
of
the
police
to
keep
in
the
line
rome
rose
up
before
them
black
against
a
band
of
saffron
light
and
in
the
violet
sky
above
that
light
the
statues
on
the
basilica
of
san
giovanni
stood
out
exaggeratedly
large
and
andrea
then
fully
realised
the
pain
he
was
inflicting
on
this
soul
chapter
x
at
the
palazzo
giustiniani
that
evening
andrea
said
to
ippolita
albonico
then
it
is
a
fixed
thing
that
i
expect
you
between
two
and
five
she
would
like
to
have
said
you
are
not
going
to
fight
but
she
did
not
dare
have
promised
she
replied
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
her
husband
came
up
to
andrea
and
taking
his
arm
with
much
effusion
began
asking
particulars
about
the
duel
he
was
a
youngish
man
slim
with
very
thin
fair
hair
and
colourless
eyes
and
projecting
teeth
he
had
a
slight
stammer
well
so
it
is
to
come
off
is
it
andrea
could
not
repress
his
disgust
and
let
his
arm
hang
loosely
at
his
side
to
show
that
he
was
in
no
mood
for
these
familiarities
seeing
the
baron
di
santa
margherita
enter
the
room
he
disengaged
himself
quickly
me
count
he
said
want
to
speak
to
santa
margherita
the
baron
met
him
with
the
assurance
that
all
was
in
order
good
at
what
hour
ten
at
the
villa
sciarra
rapiers
and
else
have
you
got
for
seconds
casteldieri
and
carlo
de
souza
we
settled
everything
as
quickly
as
possible
avoiding
formalities
giannetto
had
got
his
seconds
already
we
arranged
the
proceedings
at
the
club
without
any
fuss
try
not
to
be
too
late
in
going
to
bed
you
must
be
dead
tired
but
heedless
of
this
good
advice
on
leaving
the
palazzo
giustiniani
andrea
betook
himself
to
the
club
where
santa
margherita
came
upon
him
at
two
in
the
morning
and
forcing
him
to
leave
the
bore
him
off
on
foot
to
the
palazzo
zuccari
dear
boy
he
said
reproachfully
as
they
walked
along
are
really
foolhardy
in
a
case
like
this
the
smallest
imprudence
might
lead
to
fatal
results
to
preserve
his
full
strength
and
activity
a
good
swordsman
should
have
as
much
care
for
his
person
as
a
tenor
has
for
his
voice
the
wrist
is
as
delicate
an
organ
as
the
throat
the
articulations
of
the
legs
as
sensitive
as
the
vocal
chords
the
mechanism
suffers
from
the
smallest
disturbance
the
instrument
gets
out
of
gear

will
not
answer

the
player

a
night
of
play
or

camillo
agrippa
himself
could
not
thrust
straight
and
his
parries
were
neither

an
error
of

will
suffice
to
let

inches
of

the

made
his

swell
with
pride
and
infused
fresh
vigour
into
his

he
grasped

repeated
the
famous

pierced

but
in
the
open
he
gets
confused
he
has
only
been
out
once
before
with
my
cousin
cassibile
and
he
came
off
badly
he
does
far
too
much
of
the
one
two
one
two
three
business
in
attacking
stop
thrusts
and
hits
with
a
would
be
useful
to
you
it
was
just
in
that
way
that
my
cousin
touched
him
in
the
second
round
and
those
thrusts
are
your
special
keep
a
sharp
and
try
to
keep
your
distance
and
do
not
forget
that
you
have
to
do
with
a
man
whom
as
i
hear
you
have
robbed
of
his
mistress
and
to
whom
you
lifted
your
whip
they
had
reached
the
piazza
di
spagna
the
barcaccia
splashed
and
gurgled
softly
glistening
under
the
moon
that
was
mirrored
in
its
waters
four
or
five
hackney
carriages
stood
in
a
line
with
their
lamps
lighted
from
the
via
del
babuino
came
a
tinkle
of
bells
and
the
dull
tramp
of
hoofs
as
of
a
herd
in
motion
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
baron
took
leave
of
him
then
till
i
shall
be
with
you
a
little
before
nine
with
ludovico
you
must
make
a
pass
or
so
just
to
unstiffen
the
muscles
we
will
see
about
the
doctor
off
with
you
now
and
get
a
good
sleep
andrea
mounted
the
steps
at
the
first
broad
landing
he
stood
still
to
listen
to
the
tinkle
of
the
approaching
bells
in
truth
he
did
feel
rather
tired
and
even
a
little
heartsick
now
that
the
excitement
called
up
by
the
conversation
on
fencing
and
the
recollection
of
his
former
doughty
deeds
in
that
line
had
subsided
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
had
come
upon
him
confusedly
as
yet
and
mingled
with
doubt
and
regret
after
being
on
the
stretch
throughout
the
violent
feverish
incidents
of
the
day
his
nerves
relaxed
under
the
balmy
influences
of
the
spring
night
why
should
he
without
any
excuse
of
passion
out
of
mere
caprice
from
pure
vanity
and
arrogance
have
taken
pleasure
in
awakening
the
hatred
and
deeply
wounding
the
heart
of
a
fellow
man
the
thought
of
the
horrid
pain
that
must
be
torturing
his
adversary
filled
him
with
a
sort
of
compassion
elena
image
flashed
before
him
and
he
called
to
mind
the
anguish
he
had
endured
the
year
before
what
time
he
had
lost
her
his
jealousy
his
anger
his
nameless
torments
then
as
now
the
nights
were
serene
and
calm
and
filled
with
perfume
and
yet
how
they
weighed
upon
his
spirit
he
inhaled
the
fragrant
breath
of
the
roses
blooming
in
the
little
gardens
about
and
watched
the
flock
of
sheep
passing
through
the
piazza
below
the
mass
of
thick
white
fleece
advanced
with
a
continuous
undulating
motion
a
compact
and
unbroken
surface
like
a
muddy
wave
pouring
over
the
pavement
a
sharp
quavering
bleat
would
mingle
with
the
tinkling
bells
to
be
answered
by
other
voices
fainter
and
more
timid
from
time
to
time
the
mounted
shepherds
riding
at
either
side
or
behind
the
flock
gave
a
sharp
word
of
command
or
used
their
long
staves
the
splendour
of
the
moonlight
lent
to
this
passage
of
flocks
through
the
midst
of
the
slumbering
city
the
mystery
of
things
seen
in
a
dream
andrea
recalled
one
serene
february
night
when
on
coming
away
from
a
ball
at
the
english
embassy
he
and
elena
had
met
a
flock
of
sheep
in
the
via
venti
settembre
which
obliged
their
carriage
to
stop
elena
her
face
pressed
to
the
window
watched
the
sheep
crowding
against
the
carriage
wheels
and
pointed
to
the
little
lambs
with
childish
delight
and
he
with
his
face
close
to
hers
his
eyes
half
closed
listened
to
the
pattering
hoofs
the
bleating
the
tinkling
bells
why
should
these
recollections
of
elena
come
back
to
him
just
now
he
resumed
his
way
slowly
up
the
steps
his
feet
heavy
with
fatigue
his
knees
giving
way
beneath
him
suddenly
the
thought
of
death
flashed
across
his
mind
if
i
were
killed
or
received
such
a
wound
as
to
maim
me
for
life
but
his
thirst
for
life
and
pleasure
caused
his
whole
being
to
revolt
against
such
a
sinister
possibility
come
off
victorious
he
said
to
himself
and
he
began
reviewing
all
the
advantages
that
would
fall
to
him
from
this
second
victory
the
prestige
of
his
success
the
fame
of
his
prowess
ippolita
kisses
new
loves
new
pleasures
the
gratification
of
new
whims
presently
however
he
bethought
him
of
the
necessary
precautions
for
insuring
his
bodily
vigour
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
till
he
was
awakened
by
the
arrival
of
his
seconds
took
his
customary
had
a
strip
of
linoleum
laid
down
and
invited
santa
margherita
and
then
barbarisi
to
exchange
a
few
passes
with
him
during
which
he
executed
with
precision
several
stop
thrusts
capital
form
the
baron
congratulated
him
sperelli
then
took
two
cups
of
tea
and
some
biscuits
donned
a
very
easy
pair
of
trousers
comfortable
shoes
with
low
heels
and
a
very
slightly
starched
shirt
he
prepared
his
gloves
by
moistening
the
palm
slightly
and
rubbing
in
powdered
resin
arranged
a
leather
strap
for
fastening
the
guard
to
his
wrist
examined
the
blade
and
the
point
of
both
rapiers
omitted
no
precaution
no
detail
when
all
was
to
his
satisfaction
us
be
going
now
he
said
be
on
the
ground
before
the
others
what
about
the
doctor
will
be
waiting
for
us
there
on
the
way
down
stairs
they
met
grimiti
who
had
come
on
behalf
of
the
marchesa
shall
follow
you
to
the
villa
and
then
bring
the
news
as
quickly
as
possible
to
francesca
said
he
they
all
went
down
together
the
duke
jumped
into
his
buggy
and
the
others
entered
a
closed
carriage
andrea
made
no
show
of
indifference
or
good
spirits
to
make
jokes
before
engaging
in
a
serious
duel
seemed
to
him
execrably
bad
taste
but
he
was
perfectly
calm
he
smoked
and
listened
composedly
to
santa
margherita
and
barbarisi
who
were
discussing
apropos
of
a
recent
case
in
france
whether
it
was
legitimate
or
not
to
use
the
left
hand
against
an
adversary
now
and
again
he
leaned
forward
to
look
out
of
the
window
on
this
may
morning
rome
shone
resplendent
under
the
caressing
sun
here
a
fountain
lit
up
with
its
silvery
laughter
a
little
piazzetta
still
plunged
in
shadow
there
the
open
gates
of
a
palace
disclosed
a
vista
of
courtyard
with
a
background
of
portico
and
statues
from
the
baroque
architecture
of
a
brick
church
hung
the
decorations
for
the
month
of
mary
under
the
bridge
the
tiber
gleamed
and
glistened
as
it
hurried
away
between
the
houses
towards
the
island
of
san
bartolomeo
after
a
short
ascent
the
whole
city
spread
out
before
them
immense
imperial
radiant
bristling
with
spires
and
columns
and
obelisks
crowned
with
cupolas
and
rotundas
clean
cut
out
of
the
blue
like
a
citadel
roma
moriturus
te
salutat
exclaimed
andrea
sperelli
throwing
away
the
end
of
his
cigarette
to
tell
the
truth
my
dear
fellows
he
added
would
decidedly
inconvenience
me
this
morning
they
had
reached
the
villa
sciarra
already
partially
profaned
by
the
builders
of
modern
houses
and
were
passing
through
an
avenue
of
tall
and
slender
laurels
bordered
by
hedges
of
roses
santa
margherita
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window
caught
sight
of
another
carriage
standing
in
the
drive
before
the
villa
are
waiting
for
us
he
said
he
consulted
his
watch
ten
minutes
yet
to
the
hour
agreed
upon
he
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
went
across
with
the
other
seconds
and
the
surgeons
to
the
opponents
andrea
stayed
behind
in
the
avenue
he
went
over
in
his
own
mind
certain
points
of
attack
and
defence
he
hoped
to
employ
successfully
but
the
miracles
of
light
and
shadow
playing
fitfully
through
the
interlacing
laurels
distracted
his
attention
while
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
position
of
the
wound
he
intended
inflicting
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
the
reeds
shivering
in
the
morning
breeze
and
the
trees
tender
as
the
amorous
allegories
of
petrarch
sighed
gently
over
a
head
that
was
wholly
absorbed
in
plans
of
dealing
a
mortal
blow
barbarisi
came
to
call
him
is
ready
he
said
caretaker
has
opened
the
villa
for
us
we
have
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
at
our
disposal
most
convenient
come
and
undress
andrea
followed
him
while
he
undressed
the
two
surgeons
opened
their
surgical
cases
and
displayed
the
array
of
glittering
steel
instruments
within
one
of
them
was
a
youngish
man
pale
bald
and
with
feminine
hands
and
a
hard
mouth
with
a
continual
and
visible
contraction
of
the
lower
jaw
which
was
extraordinarily
developed
the
other
was
a
thickset
man
of
mature
years
with
a
freckled
face
bushy
red
beard
and
the
neck
of
an
ox
the
one
seemed
the
antithesis
of
the
other
and
their
disparity
excited
sperelli
curiosity
and
attention
they
set
out
upon
a
table
bandages
and
carbolic
acid
for
disinfecting
the
weapons
the
smell
of
the
acid
diffused
itself
through
the
room
as
soon
as
sperelli
was
ready
he
went
out
accompanied
by
his
second
and
the
surgeons
once
again
the
view
of
rome
seen
through
the
laurels
attracted
his
eyes
and
made
his
heart
beat
fast
he
was
full
of
impatience
he
wished
he
could
put
himself
on
guard
at
that
very
instant
and
hear
the
signal
for
the
attack
he
seemed
to
have
the
decisive
thrust
the
victory
in
his
hand
asked
santa
margherita
advancing
to
meet
him
ready
the
spot
chosen
for
the
encounter
was
a
path
at
the
side
of
the
villa
in
the
shade
and
covered
with
fine
rolled
gravel
rutolo
was
already
stationed
there
at
the
further
end
with
roberto
casteldieri
and
carlo
di
souza
everybody
wore
a
grave
not
to
say
solemn
air
the
two
adversaries
were
placed
opposite
to
one
another
and
their
eyes
met
santa
margherita
who
had
the
direction
of
the
combat
noticed
that
rutolo
shirt
was
very
stiffly
starched
and
the
collar
too
high
he
remarked
upon
it
to
casteldieri
who
exchanged
a
few
words
with
his
principal
and
sperelli
saw
the
blood
rush
to
his
adversary
face
while
he
proceeded
resolutely
to
divest
himself
of
his
shirt
andrea
with
cold
composure
followed
his
example
he
then
turned
up
his
trousers
and
santa
margherita
handed
him
the
glove
the
strap
and
the
rapier
he
armed
himself
with
scrupulous
care
and
shook
his
weapon
slightly
to
see
that
he
had
it
well
in
hand
the
movement
brought
out
the
play
of
his
biceps
very
visibly
bearing
witness
to
long
practice
of
the
arm
and
the
strength
it
had
thereby
acquired
when
the
two
combatants
measured
their
swords
for
the
distance
that
of
giannetto
rutolo
shook
convulsively
after
the
usual
set
phrases
as
to
the
honour
and
good
faith
of
the
combatants
santa
margherita
gave
the
word
in
a
ringing
powerful
voice
on
guard
the
duellists
threw
themselves
on
guard
simultaneously
rutolo
with
a
stamp
of
the
foot
sperelli
bending
forward
lightly
rutolo
was
of
medium
height
very
slender
all
nerves
with
an
olive
face
to
which
the
curled
moustaches
and
the
little
pointed
beard
à
la
charles
in
van
dyck
pictures
lent
a
certain
piquant
and
dashing
air
sperelli
was
taller
more
dignified
admirable
of
attitude
calm
and
collected
perfectly
balanced
between
grace
and
strength
his
whole
person
proclaiming
the
they
looked
each
other
full
in
the
eye
and
each
experienced
a
curious
internal
thrill
at
the
sight
of
the
bare
flesh
against
which
he
pointed
his
sharp
blade
through
the
silence
came
the
fresh
murmur
of
the
fountain
mingled
with
the
rustle
of
the
breeze
among
the
climbing
where
innumerable
yellow
and
white
roses
nodded
their
fragrant
heads
cried
the
baron
andrea
was
prepared
for
an
impetuous
attack
from
rutolo
but
the
latter
did
not
move
for
about
a
minute
they
stood
watching
each
other
closely
without
ever
crossing
swords
almost
motionless
sperelli
bending
his
knees
still
more
on
guard
with
the
point
low
assumed
the
tierce
guard
and
sought
to
provoke
his
adversary
by
the
insolent
challenge
of
his
eyes
and
by
stamping
his
foot
rutolo
made
a
step
forward
with
a
menace
of
straight
thrust
accompanying
it
with
a
cry
after
the
manner
of
certain
sicilian
fencers
the
duel
began
sperelli
avoided
any
decisive
movement
restricting
himself
to
parrying
only
forcing
his
opponent
to
discover
his
intentions
to
exhaust
all
his
methods
to
bring
out
his
whole
repertoire
of
his
parries
were
neat
and
rapid
never
yielding
a
foot
of
ground
admirable
in
precision
as
if
he
were
taking
part
in
a
fencing
match
in
the
school
with
blunt
foils
whereas
rutolo
attacked
him
warmly
accompanying
each
thrust
with
a
hoarse
cry
like
that
of
the
when
they
use
their
hatchets
cried
santa
margherita
whose
vigilant
eye
marked
every
flash
of
the
blades
he
went
up
to
rutolo
are
touched
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
said
true
rutolo
had
a
scratch
on
the
forearm
but
so
slight
that
there
was
no
need
even
of
nevertheless
he
was
breathing
hard
and
his
livid
pallor
bore
witness
to
his
suppressed
anger
know
my
man
thoroughly
now
whispered
sperelli
with
a
smile
to
barbarisi
watch
the
second
round
i
mean
to
pink
him
on
the
right
breast
as
he
spoke
he
absently
rested
the
point
of
his
rapier
on
the
ground
the
bald
young
surgeon
with
the
strong
jaw
immediately
came
up
to
him
with
a
sponge
soaked
in
carbolic
acid
and
proceeded
to
purify
the
weapon
again
heavens
andrea
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
to
barbarisi
has
all
the
air
of
a
this
rapier
is
certain
to
break
a
thrush
began
to
sing
somewhere
in
the
trees
here
and
there
a
rose
scattered
its
petals
on
the
breeze
some
fleecy
clouds
rose
to
meet
the
sun
broke
up
into
airy
flakes
and
gradually
dispersed
guard
conscious
of
his
inferiority
rutolo
determined
to
hamper
his
play
to
attack
him
at
close
quarters
and
so
break
his
continuity
of
action
for
this
he
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
shorter
stature
and
a
frame
which
being
wiry
thin
and
flexible
offered
but
little
mark
to
the
other
weapon
andrea
foresaw
that
rutolo
would
adopt
this
plan
he
stood
on
guard
bent
like
a
taut
bow
watching
for
the
right
moment
cried
santa
margherita
a
streak
of
blood
showed
on
rutolo
breast
the
rapier
had
penetrated
just
under
the
right
breast
almost
to
the
rib
the
surgeons
hurried
over
but
the
wounded
man
instantly
turned
to
casteldieri
and
with
a
tremor
of
anger
in
his
voice
said
roughly
is
a
mere
scratch
i
shall
go
on
he
refused
to
go
inside
to
have
the
the
bald
doctor
after
squeezing
the
small
hole
which
scarcely
bled
and
sponging
it
with
antiseptic
lotion
applied
a
simple
piece
of
lint
and
said
may
go
on
now
at
casteldieri
invitation
the
baron
gave
the
word
without
delay
for
the
third
round
guard
sperelli
perceived
his
danger
directly
in
front
of
him
stood
his
adversary
his
knees
firmly
bent
masked
as
it
were
behind
his
rapier
his
whole
strength
resolutely
collected
for
one
supreme
effort
his
eyes
had
a
singular
glitter
and
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
quivered
perceptibly
under
the
excessive
tension
of
the
muscles
this
time
in
order
to
avoid
the
shock
of
his
opponent
impetus
andrea
determined
to
throw
himself
to
one
side
and
repeat
the
thrust
which
cassibile
had
employed
so
successfully
the
white
patch
of
lint
on
rutolo
breast
serving
him
as
a
mark
it
was
there
he
proposed
wounding
him
again
but
this
time
the
rapier
should
enter
the
intercostal
space
and
not
be
deterred
by
the
rib
the
silence
all
about
them
deepened
the
spectators
felt
the
homicidal
desire
that
animated
the
two
men
and
were
seized
with
apprehension
their
hearts
sinking
at
the
thought
that
doubtless
they
would
have
to
carry
away
a
dead
or
dying
man
the
sun
veiled
by
fleecy
cloudlets
shed
a
milky
light

struggle
andrea
sperelli
came
back
to
life
renewed
in
body
and
spirit
like
another
man
like
a
creature
risen
out
of
the
icy
waters
of
death
with
a
mind
swept
bare
of
all
that
has
gone
before
the
past
had
receded
into
the
dim
perspective
the
troubled
waters
had
calmed
the
mud
sunk
to
the
bottom
his
soul
was
cleansed
he
returned
to
the
bosom
of
mother
nature
and
he
felt
her
him
maternally
with
goodness
and
with
strength
the
guest
of
his
cousin
at
her
villa
of
schifanoja
andrea
returned
to
life
again
in
sight
of
the
sea
the
convalescent
drew
his
breath
in
harmony
with
the
deep
calm
breath
of
the
ocean
his
mind
was
tranquillised
by
the
serenity
of
the
horizon
little
by
little
in
these
hours
of
enforced
idleness
and
retirement
his
spirit
expanded
bloomed
out
erected
itself
slowly
like
the
grass
trodden
under
foot
on
the
pathway
and
he
returned
to
truth
and
simple
faith
became
natural
and
free
of
heart
open
to
the
knowledge
and
disposed
to
the
contemplation
of
pure
things
august
was
drawing
to
a
close
an
ecstatic
serenity
reigned
over
the
sea
the
waters
were
so
transparent
that
they
repeated
every
image
with
absolute
fidelity
and
their
ultimate
line
melted
so
imperceptibly
into
the
sky
that
the
two
elements
seemed
as
one
impalpable
and
supernatural
the
wide
amphitheatre
of
hills
clothed
with
olives
oranges
and
pines
and
all
the
noblest
forms
of
italian
vegetation
embraced
the
silent
sea
and
seemed
not
a
multiplicity
of
things
but
a
single
vast
object
under
the
sunshine
lying
on
the
grass
or
sitting
on
a
rock
or
under
a
tree
the
young
man
felt
the
river
of
life
flow
within
him
as
in
a
trance
he
seemed
to
feel
the
whole
universe
throb
and
palpitate
in
his
breast
in
a
species
of
religious
rapture
he
felt
that
he
possessed
the
infinite
that
which
he
experienced
was
ineffable
divine
the
vista
before
him
opened
out
by
degrees
into
a
profound
and
long
continued
vision
the
branches
of
the
trees
overhead
supported
the
firmament
filling
the
blue
and
shining
like
the
garlands
of
immortal
poets
and
he
gazed
and
listened
and
breathed
with
the
sea
and
the
earth
placid
as
a
god
where
were
now
all
his
vanities
and
his
cruelties
his
schemes
and
his
duplicities
what
had
become
of
all
his
loves
and
his
illusions
his
disappointments
and
his
disgusts
and
the
implacable
reaction
after
pleasure
he
remembered
none
of
them
his
spirit
had
renounced
them
all
and
with
the
absence
of
desire
he
had
found
peace
desire
had
abandoned
its
throne
and
intellect
was
free
to
follow
its
proper
course
and
reflect
the
objective
world
purely
from
the
outside
point
of
view
things
appeared
clearly
and
precisely
under
their
true
form
in
their
true
colours
in
all
their
real
significance
and
beauty
every
personal
sentiment
was
in
abeyance
sterne
die
begehrt

sich
ihrer
one
desires
not
the
stars
but
rejoices
in
their
splendour
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
young
man
really
recognised
the
poetic
harmony
of
summer
skies
at
night
these
were
the
last
nights
of
august
and
there
was
no
moon
innumerable
in
the
deep
starry
vault
the
constellations
throbbed
and
palpitated
with
ardent
life
the
two
bears
hercules
cassiopeia
glittered
with
so
rapid
a
palpitation
that
they
seemed
almost
to
approach
the
earth
to
penetrate
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
the
milky
way
flowed
wide
like
a
regal
aërian
river
a
confluence
of
the
waters
of
paradise
over
a
bed
of
crystal
between
starry
banks
brilliant
meteors
cleft
the
motionless
air
from
time
to
time
gliding
lightly
and
silently
as
a
drop
of
water
over
a
sheet
of
glass
the
slow
and
solemn
respiration
of
the
sea
sufficed
to
measure
the
peace
of
the
night
without
disturbing
it
and
the
pauses
were
almost
sweeter
than
the
music
in
every
aspect
of
the
things
around
him
he
beheld
some
analogy
to
his
own
inner
life
the
landscape
became
to
him
a
symbol
an
emblem
a
sign
to
guide
him
through
the
labyrinthine
passes
of
his
own
soul
he
discovered
secret
affinities
between
the
visible
life
around
him
and
the
intimate
life
of
his
desires
and
memories
me
high
mountains
are
a
and
as
the
mountains
were
to
byron
so
the
sea
was
to
him
a
oh
that
limpid
september
sea
calm
and
guileless
as
a
sleeping
child
it
lay
outstretched
beneath
the
pearly
sky
now
green
the
delicate
and
precious
green
of
malachite
the
little
red
sails
upon
it
like
flickering
tongues
of
fire
now
intensely
almost
one
might
call
it
heraldically
blue
and
veined
with
gold
like
with
pictured
sails
upon
it
as
in
a
church
procession
at
other
times
it
took
on
a
dull
metallic
lustre
as
polished
silver
mingled
with
the
tint
of
ripe
lemons
indefinable
strange
and
delicate
and
the
sails
would
come
crowding
like
the
wings
of
the
cherubim
in
the
background
of
a
giotto
picture
forgotten
sensations
of
early
youth
came
back
to
him
that
impression
of
freshness
which
the
salt
breath
of
the
sea
infuses
into
young
blood
the
indescribable
effects
produced
by
the
changing
lights
and
shadows
the
tints
the
smell
of
the
salt
water
upon
the
unsullied
soul
the
sea
was
not
only
a
delight
to
his
eyes
but
also
an
inexhaustible
wellspring
of
peace
a
magic
fount
of
youth
wherein
his
body
regained
health
and
his
spirit
nobility
the
ocean
had
for
him
the
mysterious
attraction
of
a
mother
country
and
he
abandoned
himself
to
it
with
filial
confidence
as
a
feeble
child
might
sink
into
the
arms
of
an
omnipotent
mother
and
he
received
comfort
and
encouragement
for
who
ever
confided
his
pain
his
yearnings
or
his
dreams
to
her
in
vain
for
him
the
sea
had
ever
a
profound
word
some
sudden
revelation
some
unlocked
for
enlightenment
some
unexpected
significance
she
revealed
to
him
in
the
secret
recesses
of
his
soul
a
wound
still
gaping
though
quiescent
and
she
made
it
bleed
again
but
only
to
heal
it
with
balm
that
was
doubly
sweet
she
the
dragon
that
slumbered
within
him
till
he
felt
once
more
the
terrible
grip
of
its
claws
and
then
she
slew
it
once
for
all
and
buried
it
deep
in
his
heart
never
to
rise
again
no
corner
of
his
being
but
lay
open
to
the
great
consolatrix
but
at
times
under
the
continuous
dominion
of
this
influence
under
the
persistent
tyranny
of
this
fascination
the
convalescent
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
bewilderment
and
fear
as
if
both
the
dominion
and
fascination
were
insupportable
to
his
weak
state
the
incessant
colloquy
between
him
and
the
sea
gave
him
a
vague
sense
of
prostration
as
if
the
sublime
language
were
beyond
his
restricted
powers
so
eager
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
incomprehensible
but
this
period
of
visions
of
abstractions
of
pure
contemplativeness
was
of
short
duration
by
degrees
he
began
to
resume
his
attitude
of
to
recover
the
sensation
of
his
personality
to
return
to
his
original
frame
of
mind
one
day
at
the
hour
of
high
noon
the
vast
and
terrible
silence
when
all
life
seems
suspended
a
sudden
glimpse
into
his
own
heart
revealed
shuddering
abysses
inextinguishable
desires
ineffaceable
memories
accumulations
of
suffering
and
regret
all
the
wretchedness
he
had
gone
through
all
the
inevitable
scars
of
his
vices
all
the
results
of
his
passions
he
seemed
to
be
witnessing
the
shipwreck
of
his
whole
life
a
thousand
voices
cried
to
him
for
succour
imploring
aid
cursing
death
voices
that
he
knew
that
he
had
listened
to
in
days
gone
by
but
they
cried
and
implored
and
cursed
in
vain
feeling
that
they
were
perishing
choked
by
the
hungry
waves
then
the
voices
grew
faint
broken
irrecognisable
and
died
away
into
silence
he
was
alone
of
all
his
youth
of
all
his
boasted
fulness
of
inner
life
of
all
his
ideality
not
a
vestige
remained
within
a
black
and
yawning
abyss
around
him
impassive
nature
endless
source
of
pain
to
solitary
souls
every
hope
was
dead
every
voice
mute
every
anchor
gone
what
use
was
life
suddenly
the
image
of
elena
rose
up
before
him
then
that
of
other
women
whom
he
had
known
and
loved
each
of
them
smiled
a
hostile
smile
and
each
one
as
she
vanished
seemed
to
carry
away
something
of
him
what
he
could
not
definitely
say
an
unspeakable
distress
weighed
upon
him
an
icy
breath
of
age
swept
over
him
a
tragic
warning
voice
rang
through
his
heart
too
late
too
late
all
his
recent
comfort
and
peace
seemed
now
a
vain
delusion
a
dream
that
had
flown
a
pleasure
enjoyed
by
some
other
spirit
every
wound
he
had
ruthlessly
dealt
to
his
soul
dignity
bled
afresh
every
degradation
he
had
inflicted
upon
his
conscience
started
out
and
spread
like
a
leprosy
every
violation
he
had
committed
upon
his
ideality
roused
an
endless
despairing
terrible
remorse
in
him
he
had
lied
too
flagrantly
had
deceived
debased
himself
beyond
all
power
of
redress
he
loathed
himself
and
all
his
evil
works
shame
shame
nothing
could
wipe
out
those
dishonouring
stains
no
balm
could
ever
heal
those
wounds
he
must
for
ever
endure
the
torment
of
that
shame
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
dropping
his
head
upon
his
arms
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
weight
of
his
misery
prostrate
as
a
man
who
has
no
hope
of
salvation
with
the
new
day
he
awoke
to
new
life
one
of
those
awakenings
so
fresh
and
limpid
that
are
only
vouchsafed
to
adolescence
in
its
triumphant
springtide
it
was
a
marvellous
morning
only
to
breathe
the
air
was
pure
delight
the
whole
earth
rejoiced
in
the
living
light
the
hills
were
wrapped
about
with
a
diaphanous
silvery
veil
and
seemed
to
quiver
with
life
the
sea
appeared
to
be
traversed
by
rivulets
of
milk
by
rivers
of
crystal
and
of
emerald
by
a
thousand
currents
forming
the
rippling
intricacies
of
a
watery
labyrinth
a
sense
of
nuptial
joy
and
religious
grace
emanated
from
the
concord
between
earth
and
sky
and
he
breathed
and
gazed
and
listened
not
a
little
surprised
during
his
sleep
the
fever
had
left
him
he
had
slumbered
lulled
by
the
voice
of
the
waters
as
if
by
the
voice
of
a
faithful
friend
and
he
who
sleeps
to
the
sound
of
that
lullaby
enjoys
a
repose
that
is
full
of
healing
peace
he
gazed
and
listened
mutely
fondly
letting
the
flood
of
immortal
life
penetrate
to
his
heart
core
never
had
the
sacred
music
of
a
great
master
an
offertory
of
haydn
a
te
deum
of
mozart
produced
in
him
the
emotion
caused
now
by
the
simple
chimes
of
the
distant
village
churches
as
they
greeted
the
rising
of
the
sun
into
the
heavens
his
soul
swelled
and
overflowed
with
unspeakable
emotion
some
vision
vague
but
sublime
hovered
over
him
like
a
rippling
veil
through
which
gleamed
the
splendour
of
the
mysterious
treasure
of
ultimate
felicity
up
till
now
he
had
always
known
exactly
what
he
wished
for
and
had
never
found
any
pleasure
in
desiring
vainly
now
he
could
not
have
named
his
desire
but
he
had
no
doubts
that
the
thing
wished
for
was
infinitely
sweet
since
the
very
act
of
wishing
was
bliss
the
words
of
the
chimera
in
king
of
cyprus
old
world
verses
recurred
to
him
with
all
the
force
of
a
caressing
appeal
thou
fight
kill
thou
behold
rivers
of
blood
great
heaps
of
gold
white
herds
of
captive
women
slaves
other
and
far
other
spoils
thou
bid
marble
breathe
thou
set
up
a
temple
fashion
an
immortal
hymn
hearken
hearken
o
youth
hearken
thou
divinely
love
he
smiled
faintly
to
himself
should
i
love
art
a
woman
what
woman
elena
seemed
far
removed
from
him
lost
to
him
a
stranger
dead
the
others
still
further
off
dead
for
evermore
therefore
he
was
free
but
why
renew
a
pursuit
so
useless
and
so
perilous
why
stretch
out
his
hand
again
towards
the
tree
of
knowledge
tree
of
knowledge
has
been
plucked
all
known
as
byron
said
in
don
juan
what
he
desired
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
was
to
give
himself
freely
gratefully
to
some
higher
and
purer
being
but
where
to
find
that
being
was
the
question
truly
his
salvation
in
the
future
lay
rather
in
the
practice
of
caution
prudence
sagacity
his
tone
of
mind
seemed
to
him
admirably
expressed
in
a
sonnet
of
a
contemporary
poet
whom
from
a
certain
affinity
of
literary
tastes
and
similar
æsthetic
education
he
particularly
affected
am
as
one
who
lays
himself
to
rest
under
the
shadow
of
a
laden
tree
above
his
head
hangs
the
ripe
fruit
and
he
is
weary
of
drawing
bow
or
arbalest
he
shakes
not
the
fair
bough
that
lowliest
droops
neither
lifts
he
hand
nor
turns
to
see
but
lies
and
gathers
to
him
indolently
the
fruits
that
drop
into
his
very
breast
in
that
juiced
sweetness
he
bites
not
deep
he
fears
the
bitterness
yet
sets
it
to
his
lips
that
he
may
smell
sucks
it
with
pleasure
not
with
greediness
and
he
is
neither
grieved
nor
glad
at
it
this
is
the
ending
of
the
parable
art
art
she
was
the
only
faithful
mistress
forever
young
immortal
there
was
the
fountain
of
all
pure
joys
closed
to
the
multitude
but
freely
open
to
the
elect
that
was
the
precious
food
which
makes
a
man
like
unto
a
god
how
could
he
have
quaffed
from
other
cups
after
having
pressed
his
lips
to
that
one
how
have
followed
after
other
joys
when
he
had
tasted
that
supreme
one
what
if
my
intellect
has
become
decadent
if
my
hand
has
lost
its
cunning
what
if
i
am
no
longer
he
was
seized
with
such
panic
at
the
thought
that
he
set
himself
wildly
to
find
some
immediate
means
of
proving
to
himself
the
irrational
nature
of
his
fears
he
would
instantly
compose
some
difficult
verses
draw
a
figure
engrave
a
plate
solve
some
problem
of
form
well
and
what
then
might
not
the
result
be
entirely
fallacious
the
slow
decay
of
power
may
be
imperceptible
to
the
possessor
that
is
the
terrible
thing
about
it
the
artist
who
loses
his
genius
little
by
little
is
unaware
of
his
progressive
feebleness
for
as
he
loses
his
power
of
production
he
also
loses
his
critical
faculty
his
judgment
he
no
longer
perceives
the
defects
of
his
work
does
not
know
that
it
is
mediocre
or
bad
that
is
the
horror
of
it
the
artist
who
has
fallen
from
his
original
high
estate
is
no
more
conscious
of
his
failings
than
the
lunatic
is
aware
of
his
mental
aberration
andrea
was
seized
with
terror
better
far
better
be
dead
never
as
at
this
moment
had
he
so
fully
grasped
the
divine
nature
of
that
never
had
the
of
genius
appeared
to
him
so
sacred
his
whole
being
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
by
the
mere
suggestion
that
that
gift
might
be
destroyed
that
spark
extinguished
better
to
die
he
lifted
his
head
and
shook
off
his
inertia
then
he
went
down
to
the
park
and
walked
slowly
under
the
trees
unable
to
form
a
definite
plan
a
light
breeze
rippled
through
the
tree
tops
now
and
again
the
leaves
rustled
as
if
a
band
of
squirrels
were
passing
through
them
patches
of
blue
sky
gleamed
between
the
branches
like
eyes
beneath
their
lids
arrived
at
a
favourite
spot
of
his
a
sort
of
tiny
presided
over
by
a
hermes
plunged
in
quadruple
meditation
he
stopped
and
seated
himself
on
the
grass
with
his
back
against
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
and
his
face
turned
to
the
sea
before
him
the
straight
but
of
uneven
height
like
the
pipes
of
the
great
god
pan
intercepted
his
view
of
the
sea
all
around
him
the
acanthus
spread
the
exquisite
grace
of
its
foliage
symmetrical
as
the
capitals
of
callimachus
he
thought
of
the
words
of
salamis
in
the
of
the
acanthus
in
the
woods
of
earth
tokens
of
peace
coronals
of
most
pure
form
o
ye
the
slender
basket
that
silence
weaves
with
light
untroubled
hand
to
gather
up
the
flowers
of
woody
dreams
what
virtue
have
ye
poured
on
this
fair
youth
out
of
those
dusky
and
leaves
naked
he
sleeps
his
arm
supports
his
head
other
lines
came
back
to
him
and
yet
others
a
riot
of
verse
his
soul
was
filled
with
the
music
of
rhymes
and
rhythmic
measures
he
was
overjoyed
coming
to
him
thus
spontaneously
and
unexpectedly
this
poetic
agitation
caused
him
inexpressible
happiness
and
he
gave
ear
to
the
music
delighting
himself
in
rich
imagery
in
rare
epithets
in
the
luminous
metaphors
the
exquisite
harmonies
the
subtle
refinements
which
distinguished
his
metrical
style
and
the
mysterious
artifices
of
the
endecasyllabic
verse
learned
from
the
admirable
poets
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
more
especially
from
petrarch
once
more
the
magic
spell
of
versification
subjugated
his
soul
and
he
felt
the
full
force
of
the
sentiment
of
a
contemporary
poet
verse
is
everything
a
perfect
line
of
verse
is
absolute
immutable
deathless
it
encloses
a
thought
as
within
a
clearly
marked
circle
which
no
force
can
break
it
belongs
no
more
to
the
poet
it
belongs
to
all
and
yet
to
none
as
do
space
light
all
things
intransitory
and
perpetual
when
the
poet
is
about
to
bring
forth
one
of
these
deathless
lines
he
is
warned
by
a
divine
torrent
of
joy
which
sweeps
over
his
soul
andrea
half
closed
his
eyes
to
prolong
this
delicious
tremor
which
with
him
was
ever
the
forerunner
of
inspiration
and
more
especially
of
poetic
inspiration
and
he
determined
in
a
moment
upon
the
metrical
form
into
which
he
would
pour
his
thoughts
like
wine
into
a
cup
the
sonnet
while
composing
andrea
studied
himself
curiously
it
was
long
since
he
had
made
verses
had
this
interval
of
idleness
been
harmful
to
his
technical
capacities
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
lines
rising
one
by
one
out
of
the
depths
of
his
brain
had
a
new
grace
the
consonance
came
of
itself
and
ideas
were
born
of
the
rhymes
then
suddenly
some
obstacle
would
intercept
the
flow
a
line
would
rebel
and
the
whole
verse
would
be
displaced
like
a
shaken
puzzle
the
syllables
would
struggle
against
the
constraint
of
the
measure
a
musical
and
luminous
word
which
had
taken
his
fancy
had
to
be
excluded
by
the
severity
of
the
rhythm
do
what
he
would
to
retain
it
and
the
verse
was
like
a
medal
which
has
turned
out
imperfect
through
the
inexperience
of
the
caster
who
has
not
calculated
the
proper
quantity
of
metal
necessary
for
filling
the
mould
with
ingenious
patience
he
poured
the
metal
back
into
the
crucible
and
began
all
over
again
finally
the
verse
came
out
full
and
clear
and
the
whole
sonnet
lived
and
breathed
like
a
free
and
perfect
creature
thus
he
composed
now
slow
now
fast
with
a
delight
never
felt
before
as
the
day
grew
the
sea
cast
luminous
darts
between
the
trees
as
between
the
columns
of
a
jasper
portico
here
alma
tadema
would
have
depicted
a
sappho
with
hyacinthine
locks
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
hermes
singing
to
a
lyre
and
surrounded
by
a
chorus
of
maidens
with
locks
of
flame
all
pallid
and
intent
drinking
in
the
pure
harmony
of
the
verses
having
accomplished
the
four
sonnets
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
proceeded
to
recite
them
silently
but
with
inward
emphasis
then
he
wrote
them
on
the
quadrangular
pedestal
of
the
hermes
one
on
each
surface
in
the
following
order

thy
sense

these
my
marvellous
tidings
been

from

from
thence
have
cast
forth
every
foul

every
foul
stream
dammed
and
overthrown

unguarded

inextinguishable

vast
delighting

hearken

the

its

have
fled
because
the

into

thrust
as
into
fiery
thickets
feet
now
led
into
the
circle

the
treacherous
labyrinths

the
fair

no

with
golden
nails
ensnare
no
gorgon

it
out
of
snaky
folds
no

lull
it
on
a
sleepy
coast

at
the

a
fair
white
woman
in
the

schifanoja
was
situated
on
the
heights
at
that
point
where
the
chain
of
hills
after
following
the
curving
coast
line
took
a
landward
bend
and
sloped
away
towards
the
plain
notwithstanding
that
it
had
been
built
in
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
by
the
cardinal
alfonso
carafa
the
villa
showed
a
certain
purity
of
architectural
design
it
was
a
square
building
of
two
stories
with
arched
colonnades
alternating
with
the
apartments
which
imparted
to
the
whole
edifice
a
look
of
lightness
and
grace
it
was
a
real
summer
palace
open
on
all
sides
to
the
breath
of
the
sea
at
the
side
towards
the
sloping
gardens
a
wide
hall
opened
on
to
a
noble
double
flight
of
steps
leading
to
a
platform
like
a
vast
terrace
surrounded
by
a
stone
balustrade
and
adorned
by
two
fountains
at
either
end
of
this
terrace
other
flights
of
steps
interrupted
by
more
terraces
led
by
easy
stages
almost
to
the
sea
affording
a
full
view
from
the
level
ground
of
their
windings
through
superb
verdure
and
masses
of
roses
the
special
glories
of
schifanoja
were
its
cypresses
and
its
roses
roses
were
there
of
every
kind
and
for
every
season
enough

as
the
poet
of
the
would
have
said
the
cypresses
and
sombre
more
hieratic
than
the
pyramids
more
enigmatic
than
the
obelisks
were
in
no
respect
inferior
either
to
those
of
the
villa
or
the
villa
mondragone
or
any
of
the
giants
growing
round
the
glorious
roman
villas
the
marchesa
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
the
summer
and
part
of
the
autumn
at
schifanoja
for
though
a
thorough
woman
of
the
world
she
was
fond
of
the
country
and
its
freedom
and
liked
to
keep
open
house
there
for
her
friends
she
had
lavished
every
care
and
attention
upon
andrea
during
his
illness
had
been
to
him
like
an
elder
sister
almost
a
mother
and
untiring
in
her
devotion
she
cherished
a
profound
affection
for
her
cousin
was
ever
ready
to
excuse
or
pardon
was
a
good
and
frank
friend
to
him
capable
of
understanding
many
things
always
at
his
beck
and
call
always
cheerful
always
bright
and
witty
although
she
had
overstepped
the
thirties
by
a
year
she
had
lost
nothing
of
her
youth
vivacity
and
great
personal
charm
for
she
possessed
the
secret
of
madame
de
pompadour
fascination
that
sans
which
lights
up
with
unexpected
graces
moreover
she
possessed
that
rare
gift
commonly
called
tact
a
fine
feminine
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
was
an
infallible
guide
to
her
in
her
relations
with
a
host
of
acquaintances
of
either
sex
she
always
succeeded
in
steering
her
course
discreetly
she
never
committed
an
error
of
taste
never
weighed
heavily
on
the
lives
of
others
never
arrived
at
an
inopportune
moment
nor
became
importunate
no
deed
or
word
of
hers
but
was
entirely
to
the
point
her
treatment
of
andrea
during
the
somewhat
trying
period
of
his
convalescence
was
beyond
all
praise
she
did
her
utmost
to
avoid
disturbing
or
annoying
him
and
what
is
more
managed
that
no
one
else
should
she
left
him
complete
liberty
pretended
not
to
notice
his
whims
and
melancholies
never
worried
him
with
indiscreet
questions
made
her
company
sit
as
lightly
as
possible
on
him
at
obligatory
moments
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
refrain
from
her
usual
witty
remarks
in
his
presence
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
forcing
a
smile
andrea
recognised
her
delicacy
and
was
profoundly
grateful
returning
from
the
garden
with
unwonted
lightness
of
heart
on
that
september
morning
after
writing
his
sonnets
on
the
hermes
he
encountered
donna
francesca
on
the
steps
and
kissing
her
hand
he
exclaimed
in
laughing
tones
francesca
i
have
found
the
truth
and
the
way
she
returned
lifting
up
her
fair
rounded
arms
and
she
continued
on
her
way
down
to
the
garden
while
andrea
went
on
to
his
room
with
heart
refreshed
a
little
while
afterwards
there
came
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
and
francesca
voice
asking
i
come
in
she
entered
with
the
lap
of
her
dress
and
both
arms
full
of
great
clusters
of
dewy
roses
white
yellow
crimson
russet
brown
some
were
wide
and
transparent
like
those
of
the
villa
pamfili
all
fresh
and
glistening
others
were
densely
petalled
and
with
that
intensity
of
colouring
which
recalls
the
boasted
magnificence
of
the
dyes
of
tyre
and
sidon
others
again
were
like
little
heaps
of
odorous
snow
and
gave
one
a
strange
desire
to
bite
into
them
and
eat
them
the
infinite
gradations
of
red
from
violent
crimson
to
the
faded
pink
of
strawberries
mingled
with
the
most
delicate
and
almost
imperceptible
variations
of
white
from
the
immaculate
purity
of
freshly
fallen
snow
to
the
indefinable
shades
of
new
milk
the
sap
of
the
reed

and

said
her
laughing
face
appearing
over
the
flowers
that
covered
her
whole
bosom
up
to
the
throat
thanks
andrea
cried
again
and
again
as
he
helped
her
to
empty
the
mass
of
bloom
on
to
the
table
all
over
the
books
and
papers
and
portfolios
rosarum
her
hands
once
free
she
proceeded
to
collect
all
the
vases
in
the
room
and
fill
them
with
roses
arranging
each
cluster
with
rare
artistic
skill
while
she
did
so
she
talked
of
a
thousand
things
with
her
usual
blithe
volubility
almost
as
if
compensating
herself
for
the
parsimony
of
words
and
laughter
she
had
exercised
up
till
now
out
of
regard
for
andrea
taciturn
melancholy
presently
she
remarked
the
we
expect
a
beautiful
guest
donna
maria
ferrès
y
capdevila
the
wife
of
the
plenipotentiary
for
guatemala
do
you
know
her
think
not
i
do
not
suppose
you
could
she
only
returned
to
italy
a
few
months
ago
but
she
will
spend
next
winter
in
rome
because
her
husband
has
been
appointed
to
that
post
she
is
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
we
knew
each
other
as
children
and
were
three
years
together
at
the
convent
of
the
annunciation
in
florence
she
is
younger
than
i
am

an
american
an
italian
she
is
from
sienna
she
comes
of
the
bandinelli
family
and
was
baptized
with
water
from
the
fonte
gaja
for
all
that
she
is
rather
melancholy
by
nature
but
very
sweet
the
story
of
her
marriage
is
not
a
very
cheerful
one
ferrès
is
a
most
unsympathetic
person
however
they
have
a
little
girl
a
perfect
darling
you
will
see
a
little
white
face
with
enormous
eyes
and
masses
of
dark
hair
she
is
very
like
her
mother
look
andrea
is
not
that
rose
just
like
velvet
and
this
i
could
eat
it
look
it
is
like
glorified
cream
how
delicious
she
went
on
picking
out
the
different
roses
and
chatting
pleasantly
a
wave
of
perfume
intoxicating
as
wine
streamed
from
the
massed
flowers
some
of
the
petals
dropped
and
hung
in
the
folds
of
francesca
gown
beneath
the
window
the
dark
shaft
of
a
cypress
pierced
the
golden
sunshine
and
through
andrea
memory
ran
persistently
like
a
phrase
of
music
a
line
from
petrarch
partia

two
days
afterwards
he
repaid
his
cousin
by
presenting
her
with
a
sonnet
curiously
fashioned
on
an
antique
model
and
inscribed
on
vellum
with
illuminated
ornaments
in
the
style
of
those
that
enliven
the
missals
of
attavante
and
of

and
so
shed
on

she
spoke

much
affection

remarked

began
to

introduction
i
gave
you
about
two
years
ago
which
i
accompanied
by
a
delightful
prophecy
you
remember
ha
i
laughed
because
this
time
again
there
is
an
unknown
lady
in
question
and
this
time
too
i
may
play
the
part
of
an
involuntary
providence
oh
this
case
is
very
different
or
rather
the
difference
lies
in
the
heroine
of
the
possible
drama
mean
maria
ferrès
is
a
i
am
now
a
yes
i
had
forgotten
that
you
had
at
last
found
the
truth
and
the
way
glad
soul
laughs
because
its
loves
have
fled
you
are
quoting
my
verses
know
them
by
heart
sweet
of
you
i
confess
my
dear
cousin
that
your
fair
white
woman
holding
the
host
in
her
pure
hands
seems
to
me
a
trifle
suspicious
she
has
to
my
mind
too
much
of
the
air
of
a
hollow
shape
a
robe
without
a
body
inside
it
at
the
mercy
of
whatever
soul
be
it
angel
or
demon
that
chooses
to
enter
it
and
offer
you
the
communion
this
is
sacrilege
rank
sacrilege
you
had
better
take
care
watch
that
figure
and
use
plenty
of
exorcisms
but
there
i
am
prophesying
again
really
it
seems
a
weakness
of
mine
we
are
at
the
station
they
both
laughed
and
all
three
entered
the
little
station
to
wait
for
the
train
which
was
due
in
a
few
minutes
fernandino
a
boy
of
twelve
was
carrying
a
bouquet
which
he
was
to
present
to
donna
maria
andrea
put
in
excellent
spirits
by
his
little
conversation
with
his
cousin
took
a
from
the
bouquet
and
stuck
it
in
his
then
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
his
light
summer
clothes
and
noticed
with
complaisance
that
his
hands
had
become
whiter
and
thinner
since
his
illness
but
he
did
it
all
without
reflection
simply
from
an
instinct
of
harmless
vanity
which
had
suddenly
awakened
in
him
comes
the
train
said
fernandino
the
marchesa
hurried
forward
to
greet
her
friend
who
was
already
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
window
waving
her
hand
and
nodding
her
head
was
enveloped
in
a
large
gray
gauze
veil
which
half
covered
her
large
black
hat
francesca
she
cried
with
a
little
tremor
of
joy
in
her
voice
the
sound
of
that
voice
made
a
singular
impression
on
andrea
it
reminded
him
vaguely
of
a
voice
he
knew
but
whose
donna
maria
left
the
carriage
with
a
rapid
and
light
step
and
with
a
pretty
grace
raised
her
veil
above
her
mouth
to
kiss
her
friend
suddenly
andrea
was
struck
by
the
profound
charm
of
this
slender
graceful
veiled
woman
of
whose
face
he
saw
only
the
mouth
and
chin
let
me
present
my
cousin
to
you
count
andrea
andrea
bowed
the
lady
lips
parted
in
a
smile
that
was
rendered
mysterious
from
the
rest
of
the
face
being
concealed
by
the
veil
the
marchesa
then
introduced
andrea
to
don
manuel
ferrès
y
capdevila
then
stroking
the
hair
of
the
little
girl
who
was
gazing
at
the
young
man
with
a
pair
of
astonished
eyes
is
delfina
she
said
in
the
carriage
andrea
sat
opposite
to
donna
maria
and
beside
her
husband
she
kept
her
veil
down
still
fernandino
bouquet
lay
in
her
lap
and
from
time
to
time
she
raised
it
to
her
face
to
inhale
the
perfume
while
she
answered
the
marchesa
questions
andrea
was
right
there
were
tones
in
her
voice
exactly
like
elena
he
was
seized
with
impatient
curiosity
to
see
her
face
its
expression
and
colouring
she
was
saying
to
leave
on
friday
he
will
come
back
for
me
later
on
later
let
us
hope
said
donna
francesca
cordially
month
at
the
very
least
eh
don
manuel
the
best
plan
would
be
to
wait
and
all
go
on
the
same
day
we
are
at
schifanoja
till
the
first
of
november
my
mother
were
not
expecting
me
nothing
would
delight
me
more
than
to
stay
with
you
but
i
have
promised
faithfully
to
be
in
sienna
for
the
of
october
delfina
birthday
a
pity
on
the
there
is
the
festival
of
the
donations
at
rovigliano
so
very
beautiful
and
peculiar
is
to
be
done
if
i
do
not
keep
my
promise
my
mother
will
be
dreadfully
disappointed
she
adores
delfina
the
husband
took
no
part
whatever
in
the
conversation
he
seemed
a
very
taciturn
man
he
was
of
middle
height
inclined
to
be
stout
and
bald
and
his
skin
of
a
most
peculiar
hue
something
between
green
and
violet
in
which
the
whites
of
the
eyes
gleamed
as
they
moved
like
the
enamel
eyes
of
certain
antique
bronze
heads
his
moustache
which
was
harsh
and
black
and
cut
evenly
like
the
bristles
of
a
brush
shadowed
a
coarse
and
sardonic
mouth
he
appeared
to
be
about
forty
or
rather
more
in
his
whole
appearance
there
was
something
disagreeably
hybrid
and
morose
that
indefinable
air
of
viciousness
which
belongs
to
the
later
generations
of
bastard
races
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
moral
disorder
delfina
orange
trees
all
in
flower
exclaimed
donna
maria
stretching
out
her
hand
to
pluck
a
spray
as
they
passed
near
schifanoja
the
road
lay
between
orange
groves
the
trees
being
so
high
that
they
afforded
a
pleasant
shade
through
which
the
sighed
and
fluttered
so
laden
with
perfume
that
one
might
almost
have
quaffed
it
like
a
draught
of
cool
water
delfina
was
kneeling
on
the
carriage
seat
and
leaned
out
to
catch
at
the
branches
her
mother
wound
an
arm
about
her
to
keep
her
from
falling
out
care
take
care
you
will
tumble
wait
a
moment
till
i
untie
my
veil
would
you
mind
helping
me
francesca
she
bent
her
head
towards
her
friend
to
let
her
unfasten
the
veil
from
her
hat
and
in
doing
so
the
bouquet
of
roses
fell
at
her
feet
andrea
promptly
picked
them
up
and
as
he
rose
from
his
stooping
position
he
at
last
saw
her
whole
face
uncovered
it
was
an
oval
face
perhaps
the
least
trifle
too
long
but
hardly
worth
mentioning
that
aristocratic
oval
which
the
most
graceful
portrait
painters
of
the
fifteenth
century
were
rather
fond
of
exaggerating
the
refined
features
had
that
subtle
expression
of
suffering
and
lassitude
which
lends
the
human
charm
to
the
virgins
of
the
florentine
of
the
time
of
cosimo
a
soft
and
tender
shadow
the
fusion
of
two
diaphanous
tints
violet
and
blue
lay
under
her
eyes
which
had
the
leonine
irises
of
the
angels
her
hair
lay
on
her
forehead
and
temples
like
a
heavy
crown
and
was
gathered
into
a
massive
coil
on
her
neck
the
shorter
locks
in
front
were
thick
and
waving
as
those
that
cover
the
head
of
the
farnese
antinous
nothing
could
exceed
the
charm
of
that
delicate
head
which
seemed
to
droop
under
its
burden
as
under
some
divine
chastisement
mio
she
sighed
endeavouring
to
lighten
with
her
hands
the
weight
of
tresses
gathered
up
and
compressed
under
her
hat
head
aches
as
if
i
had
been
hanging
by
the
hair
for
an
hour
i
can
not
keep
it
fastened
up
for
long
together
it
tires
me
so
it
is
a
perfect
slavery
you
remember
at
school
broke
in
francesca
we
were
all
wild
to
comb
your
hair
it
led
to
furious
quarrels
every
day
fancy
andrea
at
last
it
came
to
bloodshed
oh
i
shall
never
forget
the
scene
between
carlotta
fiordelise
and
gabriella
vanni
it
got
to
be
sheer
monomania
to
comb
maria
bandinelli
hair
was
the
one
ambition
in
life
of
every
there
big
or
little
the
epidemic
spread
through
the
whole
school
and
resulted
in
scoldings
punishments
and
finally
threats
to
have
your
hair
cut
off
do
you
remember
maria
our
very
souls
were
enthralled
by
the
magnificent
black
plait
that
hung
like
a
rope
to
your
heels
donna
maria
smiled
a
mournful
dreamy
smile
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
the
upper
one
projecting
the
least
little
bit
beyond
the
under
one
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
plaintively
the
soft
curve
losing
itself
in
shadow
which
gave
her
an
expression
both
sad
and
kind
but
with
a
dash
of
that
pride
which
reveals
the
moral
elevation
of
those
who
have
suffered
much
and
been
strong
to
andrea
the
story
of
these
girls
enamoured
of
a
plait
of
hair
enflamed
with
passion
and
jealousy
wild
to
pass
a
comb
or
their
fingers
through
the
living
treasure
seemed
a
charming
and
poetic
episode
of
convent
life
and
in
his
imagination
this
woman
with
the
sumptuous
hair
became
vaguely
illumined
like
the
heroine
of
some
christian
legend
of
the
childhood
of
a
saint
destined
for
martyrdom
and
future
canonisation
at
the
same
time
it
struck
him
what
rich
and
varied
lines
might
be
afforded
to
the
design
of
a
female
figure
by
the
undulating
masses
of
that
black
hair
not
that
it
was
really
black
as
andrea
perceived
next
day
at
dinner
when
a
ray
of
sunshine
touched
the
lady
head
bringing
out
sombre
violet
lights
reflections
as
of
tempered
steel
or
burnished
silver
notwithstanding
its
density
too
it
was
perfectly
light
each
hair
seeming
to
stand
apart
as
if
permeated
by
and
breathing
the
air
her
conversation
revealed
keen
intelligence
and
a
delicate
mind
much
refinement
of
taste
and
pleasure
in
the
æsthetic
she
possessed
abundant
and
varied
culture
a
vivid
imagination
and
the
rich
descriptive
language
of
one
who
has
seen
many
lands
lived
under
widely
different
climes
known
many
people
to
andrea
she
seemed
to
exhale
some
exotic
charm
some
strange
fascination
some
spell
born
of
the
phantoms
of
the
far
off
things
she
had
looked
upon
the
scenes
she
still
preserved
before
her
mind
eye
the
memories
that
filled
her
soul
as
if
she
still
bore
about
her
some
traces
of
the
sunshine
she
had
basked
in
the
perfumes
she
had
inhaled
the
strange
dialects
she
had
heard
all
the
magic
of
these
countries
of
the
sun
that
evening
in
the
great
room
opening
off
the
hall
she
went
over
to
the
piano
and
opening
it
she
said
you
still
play
francesca
no
replied
the
marchesa
have
not
practised
for
years
i
feel
that
listening
to
others
is
decidedly
preferable
however
i
affect
to
be
a
patroness
of
art
and
during
the
winter
i
gladly
preside
at
the
execution
of
a
little
good
music
is
that
not
so
andrea
cousin
is
too
modest
donna
maria
she
does
something
more
than
merely
patronise
she
is
a
reviver
of
good
taste
only
last
february
thanks
to
her
we
were
made
acquainted
with
a
quintett
a
quartett
and
a
trio
of
boccherini
and
besides
that
with
a
quartett
of
cherubini
music
that
was
forgotten
but
admirable
and
always
new
boccherini
adagios
and
minuets
are
deliciously
fresh
only
the
finales
seem
to
me
a
trifle
antiquated
i
am
sure
you
must
know
something
of
his
remember
having
heard
one
of
his
quintetts
four
of
five
years
ago
at
the
conservatoire
in
brussels
and
i
thought
it
magnificent
in
the
very
newest
style
and
full
of
unexpected
episodes
i
remember
perfectly
that
in
certain
passages
the
quintett
was
reduced
to
a
duet
by
employing
the
unison
but
the
effects
produced
by
the
difference
in
the
tone
of
the
instruments
was
something
marvellous
i
can
not
recall
anything
the
least
like
it
in
other
instrumental
compositions
she
discussed
music
with
all
the
subtlety
of
a
true
connoisseur
and
in
describing
the
sentiments
aroused
in
her
by
some
particular
composition
or
the
entire
work
of
a
master
she
expressed
herself
most
felicitously
have
played
and
heard
a
great
deal
of
music
she
said
of
every
symphony
every
sonata
every
nocturne
i
have
a
separate
and
distinct
picture
an
impression
of
shape
and
colour
of
a
figure
a
group
a
landscape
so
that
each
of
my
favourite
compositions
has
a
name
corresponding
to
the
picture
for
instance
the
sonata
of
the
forty
of
priam
the
nocturne
of
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
the
gavotte
of
the
yellow
ladies
the
gigue
of
the
mill
the
prelude
of
the
drops
of
water
and
so
on
she
laughed
softly
a
laugh
which
surprised
one
with
its
ineffable
grace
on
that
plaintive
mouth
remember
francesca
the
multitude
of
notes
with
which
we
afflicted
the
margins
of
our
favourite
pieces
at
school
one
day
after
a
most
serious
consultation
we
changed
the
title
of
every
piece
of
we
possessed
and
each
title
had
a
long
explanatory
note
i
have
the
papers
still
now
when
i
play
the
or
the
all
these
mysterious
annotations
are
quite
incomprehensible
to
me
my
emotions
and
my
point
of
view
have
changed
completely
but
there
is
a
delicate
pleasure
in
comparing
the
sentiments
of
the
present
with
those
of
the
past
the
new
picture
and
the
old
it
is
a
pleasure
very
similar
to
that
of
one
diary
only
perhaps
rather
more
mournful
and
intense
a
diary
is
generally
the
description
of
real
events
a
chronicle
of
days
happy
or
otherwise
the
gray
or
rosy
traces
left
by
time
in
its
flight
the
notes
written
in
youth
on
the
margin
of
a
piece
of
music
are
on
the
contrary
fragments
of
the
secret
poems
of
a
soul
that
is
just
breaking
into
bloom
the
lyric
effusions
of
our
ideality
as
yet
untouched
the
story
of
our
dreams
what
language
what
a
flow
of
words
you
remember
francesca
she
talked
with
perfect
freedom
even
with
a
touch
of
spiritual
exaltation
like
a
person
long
condemned
to
intercourse
with
inferiors
who
has
the
irresistible
desire
to
open
her
mind
and
heart
to
a
breath
of
the
higher
life
andrea
listened
to
her
and
was
conscious
of
a
pleasing
sense
of
gratitude
towards
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
speaking
of
these
things
in
his
presence
she
offered
him
a
kindly
proof
of
friendship
and
permitted
him
to
draw
nearer
to
her
he
thereby
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
inner
world
less
through
the
actual
words
she
uttered
than
by
the
modulations
of
her
voice
and
again
he
recognised
the
accents
of
it
was
an
ambiguous
voice
a
voice
with
double
chords
in
it
so
to
speak
the
more
virile
tones
deep
and
slightly
veiled
would
soften
brighten
become
feminine
as
it
were
by
a
transition
so
harmonious
that
the
ear
of
the
listener
was
at
once
surprised
delighted
and
perplexed
by
it
the
phenomenon
was
so
singular
that
it
sufficed
by
itself
to
occupy
the
mind
of
the
listener
independently
of
the
sense
of
the
words
so
that
after
a
few
minutes
the
mind
yielded
to
the
mysterious
charm
and
remained
suspended
between
expectation
and
desire
to
hear
the
sweet
cadence
as
if
waiting
for
a
melody
played
upon
an
instrument
it
was
the
feminine
note
in
this
voice
which
recalled
sing
asked
andrea
half
shyly
little
she
replied
please
sing
a
little
entreated
donna
francesca
well
but
i
can
only
give
you
a
sort
of
idea
of
the
music
for
during
the
last
year
i
have
almost
lost
my
voice
in
the
adjoining
room
don
manuel
was
silently
playing
cards
with
the
marchese
in
the
the
light
of
the
lamps
shone
softly
red
through
a
great
japanese
shade
the
entering
through
the
pillars
of
the
hall
shook
the
high
karamanieh
curtains
and
wafted
the
perfume
of
the
garden
on
its
wings
beyond
the
pillars
was
a
vista
of
tall
cypresses
massive
and
black
as
ebony
against
a
diaphanous
sky
throbbing
with
stars
we
are
on
the
subject
of
old
music
said
donna
maria
seating
herself
at
the
piano
will
give
you
an
air
of
paisiello
out
of
an
exquisite
thing
she
accompanied
herself
as
she
sang
in
the
fervour
of
the
song
the
two
tones
of
her
voice
blended
into
one
another
like
two
precious
metals
combining
to
make
a
single
one
sonorous
warm
caressing
vibrating
paisiello
melody
simple
pure
and
spontaneous
full
of
delicious
languor
and
winged
sadness
with
a
delicately
light
accompaniment
issued
from
that
plaintive
mouth
and
rose
with
such
a
flame
of
passion
that
the
convalescent
was
moved
to
the
depths
of
his
being
and
felt
the
notes
drop
one
by
one
through
his
veins
as
if
all
the
blood
in
his
body
had
stopped
in
its
course
to
listen
a
cold
shiver
stirred
the
roots
of
his
hair
shadows
thick
and
rapid
passed
before
his
eyes
he
held
his
breath
with
excitement
in
the
weak
state
of
his
nerves
his
sensations
were
so
poignant
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
back
his
tears
dearest
maria
exclaimed
donna
francesca
kissing
her
fondly
on
the
hair
when
she
stopped
andrea
could
not
utter
a
word
he
remained
seated
where
he
was
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
his
face
in
shadow
go
on
said
francesca
she
sang
an
arietta
by
antonio
salieri
then
she
played
a
toccata
by
leonardo
leo
a
gavotte
by
rameau
a
gigue
by
sebastian
bach
under
her
magic
fingers
the
music
of
the
eighteenth
century
lived
again
so
melancholy
in
its
dance
airs
that
sound
as
if
they
were
intended
to
be
danced
to
in
a
languid
afternoon
of
a
saint
martin
summer
in
a
deserted
park
amid
silent
fountains
and
statueless
pedestals
on
a
carpet
of
dead
roses
by
pairs
of
lovers
on
the
point
of
ceasing
to
love
one
another
chapter
iv
down
a
rope
of
your
hair
to
me
that
i
may
climb
up
andrea
called
laughingly
from
the
terrace
below
to
donna
maria
where
she
stood
between
two
pillars
of
the
loggia
opening
out
of
her
rooms
it
was
morning
and
she
had
come
out
into
the
sun
to
dry
her
wet
hair
which
hung
round
her
like
a
heavy
mantle
and
accentuated
the
soft
pallor
of
her
face
the
black
border
of
the
vivid
awning
hung
above
her
head
like
a
frieze
such
as
one
sees
round
the
antique
greek
vases
of
the
campagna
had
she
had
a
garland
of
narcissus
on
her
brows
and
at
her
side
a
great
lyre
with
of
apollo
and
a
greyhound
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
pupil
of
the
school
of
mytilene
or
a
lesbian
musician
in
repose
as
imagined
by
a
send
me
up
a
madrigal
she
answered
in
the
same
playful
tone
but
drawing
back
a
little
from
view
well
i
will
go
and
write
one
in
your
honour
on
the
marble
balustrade
of
the
lowest
terrace
come
down
and
read
it
when
you
are
ready
andrea
proceeded
slowly
to
descend
the
steps
leading
to
the
lower
level
in
that
september
morning
his
soul
seemed
to
dilate
with
every
breath
he
drew
a
certain
sanctity
seemed
to
pervade
the
air
the
sea
shone
with
a
splendour
of
its
own
as
if
the
sources
of
magic
rays
lay
in
its
depths
the
whole
landscape
was
steeped
in
sunshine
he
stood
still
from
time
to
time
the
thought
that
donna
maria
was
perhaps
watching
him
from
the
loggia
disturbed
him
curiously
made
his
heart
beat
fast
and
flutter
timidly
as
if
he
were
a
boy
in
love
for
the
first
time
it
was
unspeakable
bliss
merely
to
breathe
the
same
warm
and
limpid
air
that
she
did
an
immense
wave
of
tenderness
flooded
his
heart
and
communicated
itself
to
the
trees
the
rocks
the
sea
as
if
to
beings
who
were
his
friends
and
confidants
he
was
filled
with
a
desire
to
worship
humbly
and
purely
to
bend
his
knee
and
clasp
his
hands
and
offer
up
to
some
one
this
vague
mute
adoration
which
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
explain
he
felt
as
if
the
goodness
of
all
created
things
was
being
poured
out
upon
him
and
mingling
with
all
he
possessed
of
goodness
into
one
jubilant
stream
it
be
that
i
love
her
he
asked
himself
but
he
dared
not
look
closely
into
his
soul
lest
the
delicate
enchantment
should
disperse
and
vanish
like
a
dream
at
break
of
day
i
love
her
and
what
does
she
think
and
if
she
comes
alone
shall
i
tell
her
that
i
love
her
he
took
pleasure
in
thus
asking
himself
questions
which
he
did
not
answer
intercepting
the
reply
of
his
heart
by
another
question
prolonging
his
uncertainty
at
once
so
tormenting
and
so
sweet
no
i
shall
not
tell
her
that
i
love
her
she
is
far
above
all
the
others
arrived
at
the
lowest
terrace
he
turned
round
and
looked
up
and
there
in
the
loggia
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
he
could
just
make
out
the
indistinct
outline
of
a
woman
form
had
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
and
her
thoughts
down
the
long
flights
of
steps
a
childish
impulse
made
him
suddenly
pronounce
her
name
aloud
on
the
deserted
terrace
maria
he
repeated
listening
to
his
own
voice
no
word
no
name
had
ever
seemed
to
him
so
sweet
so
melodious
so
caressing
how
happy
he
would
be
if
she
would
only
allow
him
to
call
her
maria
like
a
sister
this
woman
so
spiritual
so
soulful
inspired
him
with
the
highest
sentiment
of
devotion
and
humility
if
he
had
been
asked
what
he
considered
the
sweetest
possible
task
he
would
have
answered
in
all
sincerity
obey
her
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
mortified
him
so
much
as
to
be
accounted
by
her
a
commonplace
man
by
no
other
woman
had
he
so
ardently
desired
to
be
praised
admired
understood
appreciated
in
his
tastes
his
cultivation
his
artistic
aspirations
his
ideals
his
dreams
all
the
noblest
parts
of
his
spirit
and
his
life
and
his
highest
ambition
was
to
fill
her
heart
she
had
now
been
ten
days
at
schifanoja
and
in
those
ten
days
how
entirely
she
had
subjugated
him
they
had
conversed
sometimes
for
hours
seated
on
the
terrace
or
on
one
of
the
numerous
marble
benches
scattered
about
the
grounds
or
in
the
long
avenues
while
delfina
sped
like
a
little
gazelle
through
the
winding
paths
of
the
orange
groves
in
her
conversation
she
displayed
a
charming
flow
of
language
many
gems
of
delicate
yet
keen
observation
occasionally
affording
glimpses
of
her
inner
self
with
a
candour
that
was
full
of
grace
and
when
speaking
of
her
travels
she
would
often
by
a
single
picturesque
phrase
call
up
before
andrea
eyes
wide
vistas
of
distant
lands
and
seas
on
his
part
he
did
his
utmost
to
show
himself
to
the
best
advantage
to
impress
upon
her
the
wide
range
of
his
culture
the
refinement
of
his
taste
the
exquisite
keenness
of
his
susceptibilities
and
his
heart
swelled
with
pride
when
she
said
in
tones
of
unfeigned
sincerity
after
reading
his
of
the
music
has
ever
carried
me
away
like
this
poem
nor
has
any
statue
ever
given
me
such
an
impression
of
harmonious
beauty
certain
lines
haunt
me
persistently
and
will
continue
to
do
so
for
long
i
am
sure
they
are
so
intense
as
he
sat
now
on
the
marble
balustrade
he
was
thinking
of
these
words
of
hers
donna
maria
was
no
longer
in
the
loggia
the
awning
concealed
the
whole
space
between
the
pillars
perhaps
she
would
soon
be
down
should
he
write
the
madrigal
he
had
promised
her
but
even
the
slight
effort
necessary
for
writing
the
lines
thus
in
hot
haste
seemed
intolerable
to
him
here
in
the
wide
and
opulent
garden
blossoming
under
the
september
sunshine
in
a
sort
of
magical
spring
why
disturb
these
rare
and
delicious
emotions
by
a
hurried
search
after
rhymes
why
reduce
this
far
reaching
sentiment
to
a
brief
metrical
sigh
he
resolved
to
break
his
promise
and
remained
as
he
was
idly
watching
the
sails
on
the
distant
horizon
like
fiery
torches
outshining
the
sun
but
as
time
went
on
he
grew
restless
and
nervous
turning
round
every
minute
to
see
if
a
feminine
form
had
not
appeared
between
the
columns
of
the
vestibule
which
gave
access
to
the
steps
this
then
a
love
tryst
did
he
expect
her
to
join
him
here
for
some
secret
interview
had
she
any
idea
of
his
agitation
his
heart
gave
a
great
throb
it
was
she
she
was
alone
slowly
she
descended
the
steps
and
when
she
reached
the
first
terrace
she
stopped
beside
the
fountain
andrea
followed
her
intently
with
his
eyes
her
every
movement
every
attitude
sent
a
delicious
thrill
through
him
as
if
each
one
of
them
had
some
special
significance
were
a
form
of
individual
expression
thus
she
passed
down
the
succession
of
steps
and
terraces
appearing
and
disappearing
now
completely
hidden
by
the
now
only
her
head
or
her
rounded
bust
visible
above
them
sometimes
the
thickly
interlaced
boughs
hid
her
for
several
minutes
then
where
the
bushes
were
thinner
the
colour
of
her
dress
would
show
through
them
and
the
pale
straw
of
her
hat
would
catch
the
sunlight
the
nearer
she
came
the
more
slowly
she
walked
loitering
among
the
verdant
shrubs
stopping
to
gaze
at
the
cypresses
stooping
to
gather
a
handful
of
fallen
leaves
from
the
last
terrace
but
one
she
waved
her
hand
to
andrea
standing
waiting
for
her
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
threw
down
to
him
the
leaves
she
had
gathered
which
first
rose
fluttering
in
the
air
like
a
cloud
of
butterflies
and
then
floated
down
now
fast
now
slow
noiseless
as
snowflakes
on
the
stones
she
asked
leaning
over
the
balustrade
have
you
got
for
me
andrea
bent
his
knee
to
the
step
and
lifted
his
clasped
hands
he
was
obliged
to
confess
implore
you
to
forgive
me
but
this
morning
you
and
the
sun
together
filled
the
whole
world
for
me
with
sweetness
and
light
the
confession
was
perfectly
sincere
as
was
the
adoration
also
though
both
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
banter
donna
maria
evidently
felt
the
sincerity
for
she
coloured
slightly
as
she
said
with
peculiar
earnestness
do
please
do
kneel
he
rose
and
she
offered
him
her
hand
adding
will
forgive
you
this
time
because
you
are
an
invalid
she
wore
a
dress
of
a
curious
indefinable
dull
rusty
red
one
of
those
æsthetic
colours
one
meets
with
in
the
pictures
of
the
early
masters
or
of
dante
gabriel
rossetti
it
was
arranged
in
a
multitude
of
straight
regular
folds
beginning
immediately
under
the
arms
and
was
confined
at
the
waist
by
a
wide
ribbon
of
the
pale
tinge
of
a
faded
turquoise
that
fell
in
a
great
knot
at
her
side
the
sleeves
were
very
full
and
soft
and
were
gathered
in
closely
at
the
wrist
another
ribbon
of
the
same
shade
but
much
narrower
encircled
her
neck
and
was
tied
at
the
left
side
in
a
small
bow
and
a
similar
ribbon
fastened
the
end
of
the
prodigious
plait
which
fell
from
under
her
straw
hat
round
which
was
twined
a
wreath
of
hyacinths
like
that
of
alma
tadema
pandora
a
great
persian
turquoise
her
sole
ornament
shaped
like
a
scarabeus
and
engraved
with
talismanic
characters
fastened
her
dress
at
the
throat
us
wait
for
delfina
she
said
then
what
do
you
say
to
our
going
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
cybele
would
that
suit
you
she
was
full
of
delicate
consideration
for
the
convalescent
andrea
was
still
very
pale
and
thin
which
made
his
eyes
look
extraordinarily
large
the
somewhat
sensual
expression
of
his
mouth
forming
a
singular
and
not
unattractive
contrast
to
the
upper
part
of
his
face
he
replied
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
you
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
you
mind
if
i
am
rather
silent
this
morning
do
you
ask
me
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
lost
my
tongue
and
could
find
nothing
to
say
and
yet
silence
becomes
burdensome
and
annoying
if
it
is
prolonged
that
is
why
i
ask
if
during
our
walk
you
will
allow
me
to
be
silent
and
only
listen
to
you
then
we
will
be
silent
together
she
said
with
a
little
smile
she
looked
up
towards
the
villa
with
evident
impatience
a
long
time
delfina
is
francesca
up
when
you
came
out
asked
andrea
no
she
is
incredibly
lazy
ah
there
is
delfina
do
you
see
her
the
little
girl
came
hurrying
down
followed
by
her
governess
though
not
visible
on
the
flight
of
steps
she
appeared
upon
the
terraces
which
she
traversed
at
a
run
her
hair
floating
over
her
shoulders
in
the
breeze
from
under
a
straw
hat
wreathed
with
poppies
on
the
last
step
she
opened
her
arms
wide
to
her
mother
and
covered
her
face
with
kisses
after
this
she
said
morning
andrea
and
presented
her
forehead
to
his
kiss
with
childlike
and
adorable
grace
she
was
a
fragile
creature
highly
strung
and
vibrating
as
an
instrument
fashioned
of
sentient
material
her
flesh
so
delicately
transparent
as
to
seem
incapable
of
concealing
or
even
veiling
the
radiance
of
the
spirit
that
dwelt
within
it
like
a
flame
in
a
precious
lamp
dearest
murmured
her
mother
gazing
at
her
with
a
look
in
which
was
concentrated
all
the
tenderness
of
a
soul
wholly
occupied
by
this
one
absorbing
affection
but
at
those
words
that
look
that
caress
andrea
felt
a
sudden
stab
of
jealousy
something
like
a
rebuff
as
if
her
heart
were
turning
away
from
him
eluding
him
becoming
inaccessible
the
governess
asked
permission
to
return
to
the
villa
and
the
three
turned
into
a
path
bordered
by
delfina
ran
on
in
front
with
her
hoop
her
straight
slender
little
legs
in
their
long
black
stockings
moving
with
rhythmic
grace
seem
a
little
out
of
spirits
now
said
donna
maria
to
her
companion
only
a
little
while
ago
when
you
came
down
you
seemed
so
bright
is
something
troubling
you
do
you
not
feel
so
well
she
put
these
questions
in
an
almost
sisterly
manner
soberly
and
kindly
inviting
his
confidence
a
timid
desire
a
vague
temptation
assailed
the
invalid
to
slip
his
arm
through
hers
and
let
her
lead
him
in
silence
through
the
flickering
shadows
and
the
perfumes
over
the
ground
down
the
pathways
measured
off
at
intervals
by
ancient
statues
he
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
returned
to
the
first
days
of
his
illness
those
days
of
happy
languor
and
and
felt
as
if
he
had
great
need
of
a
friendly
support
an
affectionate
a
familiar
arm
the
desire
grew
so
intense
that
the
words
which
would
give
it
voice
rushed
to
his
lips
however
he
merely
replied
donna
maria
thank
you
i
feel
quite
well
it
is
only
that
the
september
weather
rather
affects
me
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
rather
doubted
the
sincerity
of
his
reply
but
to
avoid
an
awkward
silence
after
his
evasive
remark
she
asked
of
the
neutral
months
do
you
like
best
april
or
september
september
it
is
more
feminine
more
discreet
more
mysterious
like
a
spring
seen
in
a
dream
then
all
the
plants
slowly
lose
their
vital
forces
and
at
the
same
time
some
of
their
reality
look
at
the
sea
over
there
has
it
not
more
the
appearance
of
an
atmosphere
than
of
a
solid
mass
of
water
and
never
to
my
mind
does
the
union
of
sea
and
sky
seem
so
mystical
so
profound
as
in
september
they
had
very
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
path
why
should
andrea
be
suddenly
seized
with
a
tremor
of
nervous
fear
on
approaching
the
spot
where
a
fortnight
ago
he
had
written
the
sonnets
on
his
deliverance
why
this
struggle
between
hope
and
anxiety
lest
she
should
discover
them
and
read
them
why
did
some
of
the
lines
keep
running
in
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
others
as
if
they
expressed
his
actual
sentiments
at
that
moment
his
aspirations
the
new
dream
he
carried
in
his
heart
lay
at
thine
untroubled
feet
my
fate
it
was
true
it
was
true
he
loved
her
he
laid
his
whole
life
at
her
feet
was
conscious
of
but
one
desire
humble
and
absorbing
to
be
the
earth
between
her
footsteps
beautiful
it
is
here
exclaimed
donna
maria
as
she
entered
the
demesne
of
the
hermes
into
the
paradise
of
the
acanthus
what
a
strange
scent
the
whole
air
was
full
of
the
odour
of
musk
as
from
the
unseen
presence
of
some
insect
or
animal
the
shadows
were
deep
and
mysterious
the
rays
of
light
which
pierced
the
foliage
already
touched
by
the
finger
of
autumn
seemed
like
shafts
of
moonlight
shining
through
the
storied
windows
of
a
cathedral
a
mixed
sentiment
partly
pagan
partly
christian
seemed
to
emanate
from
this
sylvan
retreat
as
from
a
mythological
picture
painted
by
an
early
christian
artist
look
look
delfina
her
mother
exclaimed
in
the
excited
tones
of
one
who
suddenly
comes
upon
a
thing
of
beauty
delfina
had
skilfully
woven
little
sprays
of
orange
blossom
into
a
garland
and
now
with
the
fancifulness
of
childhood
she
was
eager
that
it
should
encircle
the
head
of
the
marble
deity
she
could
not
reach
it
but
did
her
best
to
accomplish
her
object
by
standing
on
and
stretching
her
arm
to
its
utmost
extent
her
slender
elegant
and
vivacious
little
figure
offering
a
striking
contrast
to
the
rigid
square
and
solemn
form
of
the
statue
like
a
against
an
oak
all
her
efforts
were
however
fruitless
smilingly
her
mother
came
to
her
aid
taking
the
wreath
from
the
child
hand
she
placed
it
on
the
pensive
brows
of
the
god
as
she
did
so
her
eyes
fell
involuntarily
upon
the
inscriptions
has
been
writing
verses
you
she
asked
turning
to
andrea
in
surprise
and
pleasure
i
recognise
your
hand
forthwith
she
knelt
upon
the
grass
to
read
with
eager
curiosity
while
donna
maria
read
the
words
in
a
low
voice
delfina
leaned
upon
her
mother
shoulder
one
arm
about
her
neck
cheek
pressed
to
cheek
the
two
figures
thus
bending
over
the
pedestal
of
the
tall
statue
in
the
uncertain
light
surrounded
by
the
emblematical
acanthus
formed
a
group
so
harmonious
in
line
and
colouring
that
the
poet
stood
a
moment
lost
in
pure
æsthetic
pleasure
and
admiration
but
the
next
moment
the
old
obscure
sense
of
jealousy
was
upon
him
once
more
the
fragile
little
creature
clinging
to
the
mother
indissolubly
connected
with
her
mother
very
being
seemed
to
him
an
enemy
an
insurmountable
obstacle
rising
up
against
his
love
his
desires
his
hopes
he
was
not
jealous
of
the
husband
but
he
was
of
the
daughter
it
was
not
the
body
but
the
soul
of
this
woman
that
he
longed
to
possess
and
to
possess
it
wholly
undivided
with
all
its
tenderness
all
its
joys
its
hopes
its
fears
its
pain
its
dreams
in
short
the
sum
total
of
her
spiritual
being
and
be
able
to
say
am
the
life
of
her
life
but
instead
it
was
the
daughter
who
possessed
all
this
incontestably
absolutely
continuously
when
her
idol
left
her
side
even
for
a
short
time
the
mother
seemed
to
miss
some
essential
element
of
her
existence
her
face
was
instantaneously
and
visibly
transfigured
when
after
a
brief
absence
that
childish
voice
fell
upon
her
ear
once
more
at
times
unconsciously
and
as
if
by
some
occult
correspondence
some
law
of
common
vital
accordance
she
would
repeat
a
gesture
of
the
child
a
smile
an
attitude
a
pose
of
the
head
again
when
the
child
was
in
repose
or
asleep
she
had
moments
of
contemplation
so
intense
that
she
seemed
to
have
lost
all
sense
of
her
surroundings
and
to
have
absorbed
herself
into
the
creature
she
was
contemplating
when
she
spoke
to
her
darling
every
word
was
a
caress
and
the
plaintive
lines
vanished
from
her
mouth
under
the
child
kisses
her
lips
quivered
and
her
eyes
filled
with
ineffable
happiness
like
the
eyes
of
an
ecstatic
at
a
beatific
vision
if
she
happened
to
be
conversing
with
other
people
or
listening
to
their
talk
she
would
appear
to
have
sudden
lapses
of
attention
momentary
absence
of
mind
and
this
was
for
her
daughter
for
her
always
for
her
who
could
ever
break
that
chain
could
any
one
ever
succeed
in
conquering
a
part
even
the
very
smallest
atom
of
that
heart
andrea
suffered
as
under
an
irreparable
loss
some
forced
renunciation
some
shattered
hope
at
this
moment
this
very
moment
was
not
the
child
stealing
something
from
him
for
delfina
was
playfully
constraining
her
mother
to
remain
upon
her
knees
she
hung
with
all
her
weight
round
donna
maria
neck
crying
through
her
laughter
no
no
you
shall
not
get
up
and
whenever
her
mother
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
she
clapped
her
little
hands
over
it
to
prevent
her
made
her
laugh
bandaged
her
eyes
with
the
long
plait
played
a
hundred
pranks
watching
her
andrea
felt
that
by
all
this
playful
commotion
she
was
dispelling
from
her
mother
all
that
his
verses
had
possibly
instilled
into
her
mind
when
at
last
donna
maria
succeeded
in
freeing
herself
from
her
darling
tyrant
she
saw
his
annoyance
in
his
face
and
hastened
to
say
me
andrea
delfina
is
sometimes
taken
with
these
fits
of
wildness
with
a
deft
hand
she
the
disordered
folds
of
her
dress
there
was
a
faint
flush
under
her
eyes
and
her
breath
came
quickly
forgive
her
too
she
continued
with
a
smile
to
which
the
unwonted
animation
of
colour
lent
a
singular
light
of
consideration
for
her
unconscious
homage
for
it
was
she
who
had
the
happy
inspiration
to
place
a
nuptial
wreath
over
your
verses
which
sing
of
nuptial
communion
that
sets
a
seal
upon
the
alliance
thanks
both
to
you
and
to
delfina
answered
andrea
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
called
him
by
his
christian
name
and
the
unexpected
familiarity
combined
with
her
gentle
words
restored
his
confidence
delfina
had
run
off
down
one
of
the
paths
verses
are
a
spiritual
record
are
they
not
donna
maria
resumed
you
give
them
to
me
that
i
may
not
forget
them
his
natural
impulse
was
to
answer
are
yours
by
right
for
they
speak
of
you
and
to
you
but
he
only
said
shall
have
them
they
continued
their
way
towards
the
cybele
but
as
they
were
leaving
the
little
enclosure
donna
maria
suddenly
turned
round
towards
the
hermes
as
if
some
one
had
called
her
her
brow
seemed
heavy
with
thought
are
you
thinking
about
andrea
asked
her
almost
timidly
was
thinking
about
you
she
replied
were
you
thinking
about
me
was
thinking
of
your
past
life
of
which
i
know
nothing
whatever
you
have
suffered
greatly
have
greatly
sinned
loved
much
do
not
know
perhaps
it
was
not
love
that
i
felt
perhaps
i
have
yet
to
learn
what
love
is
really
i
can
not
say
she
did
not
answer
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
little
way
to
their
right
the
path
was
bordered
by
high
laurels
alternating
at
regular
intervals
with
cypress
trees
and
in
the
background
through
the
fluttering
leaves
the
sea
rippled
and
laughed
blue
as
the
flower
of
the
flax
on
their
left
ran
a
kind
of
parapet
like
the
back
of
a
long
stone
bench
ornamented
throughout
its
whole
length
with
the
ateleta
shield
and
arms
and
a
griffin
alternately
under
each
of
which
again
was
a
sculptured
mask
through
whose
mouth
a
slender
stream
of
water
fell
into
a
basin
below
shaped
like
a
sarcophagus
and
ornamented
with
mythological
subjects
in
low
relief
there
must
have
been
a
hundred
of
these
mouths
for
the
walk
was
called
the
avenue
of
the
hundred
fountains
but
many
of
them
were
stopped
up
by
time
and
had
ceased
to
spout
while
others
did
very
little
many
of
the
shields
were
broken
and
moss
had
obliterated
the
coats
of
arms
many
of
the
griffins
were
headless
and
the
figures
on
the
sarcophagi
appeared
through
a
veil
of
moss
like
fragments
of
silver
work
through
an
old
and
ragged
velvet
cover
on
the
water
in
the
basins
more
green
and
limpid
than
emerald
waved
and
quivered
or
rose
leaves
fallen
from
the
bushes
overhead
floated
slowly
while
the
surviving
waterpipes
sent
forth
a
sweet
and
gurgling
music
that
played
over
the
murmur
of
the
sea
like
the
accompaniment
to
a
melody
you
hear
that
said
donna
maria
standing
still
to
listen
attracted
by
the
charm
of
the
sound
is
the
music
of
salt
and
of
sweet
waters
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
path
finger
on
lip
leaning
a
little
towards
the
fountains
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
listens
and
fears
to
be
disturbed
andrea
who
was
next
the
parapet
turned
and
saw
her
thus
against
a
background
of
delicate
and
feathery
verdure
such
as
an
umbrian
painter
would
have
given
to
an
annunciation
or
a
nativity
he
murmured
his
heart
filling
with
fond
adoration
maria
it
afforded
him
untold
pleasure
to
mingle
the
soft
accents
of
her
name
with
the
music
of
the
waters
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
as
a
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
me
he
said
unable
to
control
his
emotion
i
can
not
help
myself
it
is
my
soul
that
calls
to
you
a
strange
nervous
exaltation
had
taken
possession
of
him
all
the
of
his
soul
had
caught
the
lyric
glow
and
flamed
up
irresistibly
the
hour
the
place
the
sunshine
everything
about
them
suggested
love
from
the
extreme
limits
of
the
sea
to
the
humble
little
ferns
of
the
fountains
all
seemed
to
him
part
of
the
same
magic
circle
whose
central
point
was
this
woman
can
never
know
he
went
on
in
a
subdued
voice
as
if
fearful
of
offending
her
can
never
know
how
absolutely
my
soul
is
yours
she
grew
suddenly
very
pale
as
if
all
the
blood
in
her
veins
had
rushed
to
her
heart
she
did
not
speak
she
did
not
look
at
him
she
cried
with
a
tremor
of
agitation
in
her
voice
there
was
no
answer
the
little
girl
had
wandered
off
among
the
trees
at
the
end
of
the
long
avenue
she
repeated
louder
than
before
in
a
sort
of
terror
in
the
pause
that
followed
her
cry
the
songs
of
the
two
waters
seemed
to
make
the
silence
deeper
there
was
a
rustling
in
the
leaves
as
if
from
the
passage
of
a
little
kid
and
the
child
came
bounding
through
the
laurel
thicket
carrying
in
her
hands
her
straw
hat
heaped
to
the
brim
with
little
red
berries
she
had
gathered
her
exertions
and
the
running
had
brought
a
deep
flush
to
her
cheeks
broken
twigs
were
sticking
in
her
frock
and
some
leaves
hung
trembling
in
the
meshes
of
her
ruffled
hair
mamma
come
quick
do
come
with
me
she
began
dragging
her
mother
away
is
a
perfect
forest
over
there
heaps
and
heaps
of
berries
come
with
me
mamma
do
come
darling
i
would
rather
not
it
is
getting
late
do
come
it
is
late
come
donna
maria
was
obliged
to
give
in
and
let
herself
be
dragged
along
by
the
hand
is
a
way
of
reaching
the
arbutus
wood
without
going
through
the
thicket
said
andrea
you
hear
delfina
there
is
a
better
way
mamma
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
delfina
pulled
her
mother
along
towards
the
sea
through
the
laurel
thicket
and
andrea
followed
content
to
be
able
to
gaze
without
restraint
at
the
beloved
figure
in
front
of
him
to
devour
her
with
his
eyes
to
study
her
every
movement
and
her
rhythmic
walk
interrupted
every
moment
by
the
irregularities
of
the
path
the
obstacles
presented
by
the
trees
and
their
interlaced
branches
but
while
his
eyes
feasted
on
these
things
his
mind
was
chiefly
occupied
in
recalling
the
one
attitude
the
one
look
oh
that
pallor
that
sudden
pallor
just
now
when
he
had
proffered
those
few
low
words
and
the
indefinable
tone
of
her
voice
when
she
called
delfina
it
far
now
asked
donna
maria
no
mamma
we
are
just
there
here
it
is
as
they
neared
the
spot
a
sort
of
shyness
came
over
andrea
since
those
words
of
his
he
had
not
met
maria
eye
what
did
she
think
what
were
her
feelings
what
would
her
eyes
say
when
at
last
she
looked
at
him
it
is
cried
the
little
girl
the
laurels
had
grown
thinner
affording
a
freer
view
of
the
sea
and
the
next
moment
the
mass
of
arbutus
flushed
before
them
like
a
forest
of
coral
with
large
tassels
of
blossom
at
the
end
of
their
branches
a
glory
murmured
maria
the
marvellous
wilderness
bloomed
and
bore
fruit
in
a
deep
and
sunny
space
curved
like
an
amphitheatre
in
which
all
the
delicious
sweetness
of
that
aromatic
shore
seemed
gathered
up
and
concentrated
the
stems
tall
and
slender
crimson
for
the
most
part
but
here
and
there
yellow
bore
great
shining
green
leaves
all
motionless
in
the
calm
air
innumerable
tassels
of
blossom
like
sprays
of
white
and
dewy
hung
from
the
young
boughs
while
the
maturer
ones
were
loaded
with
red
or
fruit
and
all
this
wondrous
pomp
of
blossom
and
fruit
of
green
leaves
and
rosy
stems
displayed
against
the
brilliant
blue
of
the
sea
like
a
garden
in
a
fairy
tale
intense
and
fantastic
as
a
dream
a
marvel
donna
maria
advanced
slowly
no
longer
led
by
delfina
who
wild
with
delight
rushed
about
with
no
thought
but
for
stripping
the
whole
wood
andrea
plucked
up
his
courage
you
forgive
me
he
asked
anxiously
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
indeed
seeing
you
so
far
above
me
so
pure
so
unapproachable
i
thought
that
never
in
this
world
could
i
reveal
my
secret
to
you
never
ask
anything
of
you
never
put
myself
in
your
way
since
ever
i
saw
you
i
have
thought
of
you
night
and
day
but
without
hope
without
any
definite
end
in
view
i
know
that
you
do
not
love
me
that
you
never
can
love
me
and
yet
believe
me
i
would
renounce
every
promise
that
life
may
have
in
store
for
me
just
for
the
hope
of
living
in
a
little
corner
of
your
heart
she
continued
to
advance
slowly
under
the
trees
while
the
delicate
tassels
of
pink
and
white
blossom
swayed
gently
above
her
head
me
maria
only
believe
me
if
i
were
bidden
at
this
moment
to
give
up
every
desire
and
every
ambition
the
dearest
memories
of
the
past
and
the
most
flattering
promises
of
the
future
and
to
live
solely
in
the
thought
of
and
for
you
without
a
without
a
yesterday
without
other
ties
or
attachments
far
from
the
world
lost
to
everything
but
you
till
death
to
all
eternity
i
would
not
hesitate
for
one
instant
you
have
looked
at
me
and
talked
to
me
have
smiled
and
answered
you
have
sat
at
my
side
pensive
and
silent
side
by
side
with
me
you
have
lived
your
own
inner
life
that
inscrutable
and
inaccessible
existence
of
which
i
know
nothing
can
never
know
anything
and
your
soul
has
taken
full
and
absolute
possession
of
mine
to
its
deepest
depths
but
without
ever
a
thought
without
being
aware
of
it
as
the
ocean
swallows
up
a
what
is
my
love
to
you
what
is
any
love
to
you
the
word
has
too
often
been
profaned
and
the
sentiment
too
often
a
i
do
not
offer
you
love
but
surely
you
will
not
refuse
the
humble
tribute
of
devotion
that
my
spirit
offers
up
to
a
being
nobler
and
higher
than
itself
she
walked
on
at
the
same
slow
pace
her
head
bent
her
face
bloodless
towards
a
seat
at
the
further
end
of
the
wood
and
facing
the
sea
it
was
a
wide
semicircle
of
white
marble
with
a
back
running
round
the
entire
length
and
for
sole
ornamentation
a
lion
paw
at
each
end
as
a
support
it
recalled
those
antique
seats
on
which
in
some
island
of
the
archipelago
or
in
greece
or
pompeii
ladies
reclined
and
listened
to
a
reading
from
the
poets
under
the
shade
of
the
oleanders
within
sight
of
the
sea
here
the
arbutus
cast
the
shadow
of
its
blossom
and
its
fruit
and
in
contrast
to
the
marble
the
coral
of
the
stems
seemed
more
vivid
than
elsewhere
care
for
everything
that
interests
you
you
possess
all
those
things
after
which
i
am
seeking
pity
from
you
would
be
more
precious
to
me
than
passionate
love
from
any
other
woman
your
hand
upon
my
heart
i
know
would
cause
a
second
youth
to
spring
up
in
me
far
purer
than
the
first
and
stronger
the
ceaseless
vacillation
which
makes
up
the
sum
of
my
inner
life
would
find
rest
and
stability
in
you
my
unsatisfied
and
restless
spirit
harried
by
a
perpetual
warfare
between
attraction
and
repulsion
eternally
and
irremediably
alone
would
find
in
yours
a
haven
of
refuge
against
the
doubts
which
contaminate
every
ideal
and
weaken
the
will
there
are
men
more
unfortunate
but
i
doubt
if
in
the
whole
wide
world
there
was
ever
one
less
happy
than
i
he
was
making
use
of
obermann
words
as
his
own
in
the
sort
of
sentimental
intoxication
to
which
he
had
worked
himself
up
all
his
melancholy
broodings
surged
to
his
lips
and
the
mere
sound
of
his
own
voice
with
a
little
quiver
of
humble
entreaty
in
it
served
to
augment
his
emotions
do
not
venture
to
tell
you
all
my
thoughts
at
your
side
during
the
few
days
since
i
first
met
you
i
have
had
moments
of
oblivion
so
complete
as
almost
to
make
me
feel
that
i
was
back
in
the
first
days
of
my
convalescence
when
the
sense
of
another
world
was
still
present
with
me
the
past
the
future
were
obliterated
as
if
the
former
had
never
been
and
the
latter
never
would
be
the
whole
world
was
without
form
and
void
then
something
like
a
dream
dim
but
stupendous
rose
upon
my
soul
a
fluttering
veil
now
impenetrable
now
transparent
and
yielding
intermittent
glimpses
of
a
splendid
but
unattainable
treasure
what
did
you
know
or
care
about
me
in
such
moments
doubtless
your
spirit
was
far
away
from
me
and
yet
your
mere
bodily
presence
was
sufficient
to
intoxicate
me
i
felt
it
flowing
through
my
veins
like
blood
taking
hold
upon
my
soul
with
superhuman
force
she
sat
silent
and
motionless
gazing
straight
before
her
her
figure
erect
her
hands
rigidly
clasped
in
her
lap
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
makes
a
supreme
effort
to
brace
himself
against
his
own
weakness
only
her
mouth
the
expression
of
the
lips
she
vainly
strove
to
keep
firm
betrayed
a
sort
of
anguished
rapture
dare
not
tell
you
all
i
maria
maria
can
you
forgive
me
say
that
you
forgive
me
two
little
hands
came
suddenly
from
behind
the
seat
and
clasped
themselves
over
the
mother
eyes
and
a
voice
panting
with
fun
and
mischief
cried
who
it
is
guess
who
it
is
she
smiled
and
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
backwards
by
clinging
fingers
and
instantly
with
preternatural
clearness
andrea
saw
that
smile
wipe
away
all
the
obscure
delicious
pain
from
her
lips
efface
every
sign
that
might
be
construed
into
an
avowal
put
to
flight
the
least
lingering
shadow
of
uncertainty
that
he
might
possibly
have
converted
into
a
gleam
of
hope
he
sat
there
like
a
man
who
has
expected
to
drink
from
an
overflowing
cup
and
suddenly
finds
it
has
nothing
but
the
empty
air
to
offer
to
his
thirsty
lips
the
little
girl
covered
her
mother
head
with
loud
quick
kisses
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
even
hurting
her
a
little
know
who
it
is
i
know
who
it
is
cried
donna
maria
me
go
will
you
give
me
if
i
do
you
like
i
want
a
pony
to
carry
back
my
berries
to
the
house
come
and
see
what
a
heap
i
have
collected
she
ran
round
the
seat
and
pulled
her
mother
by
the
hand
donna
maria
rose
rather
wearily
and
as
she
stood
up
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
as
if
overcome
by
sudden
giddiness
andrea
rose
too
and
both
followed
in
delfina
wake
the
mischievous
child
had
stripped
half
the
wood
of
fruit
the
lower
branches
had
not
a
single
berry
left
with
the
aid
of
a
stick
picked
up
goodness
knows
where
she
had
reaped
a
prodigious
harvest
and
then
piled
up
the
fruit
into
one
great
heap
so
intense
in
colouring
against
the
dark
soil
that
it
looked
like
a
heap
of
glowing
embers
the
flowers
had
apparently
not
attracted
her
there
they
hung
white
and
pink
and
yellow
and
translucent
more
delicate
than
the
flowering
locks
of
the
acacia
more
graceful
than
the
all
bathed
in
dim
golden
light
delfina
delfina
exclaimed
donna
maria
looking
round
upon
the
devastation
have
you
done
the
child
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
with
glee
in
front
of
the
crimson
pyramid
will
have
to
leave
it
all
here
no
at
first
she
refused
but
she
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
half
to
herself
with
beaming
eyes
doe
will
come
and
eat
them
she
had
probably
noticed
the
beautiful
creature
moving
about
in
the
park
and
the
thought
of
having
collected
so
much
food
for
it
pleased
her
and
fired
her
imagination
already
full
of
stories
in
which
deer
are
beneficent
and
powerful
fairies
who
repose
on
silken
cushions
and
drink
from
jewelled
cups
she
remained
silent
and
absorbed
picturing
to
herself
the
beautiful
tawny
animal
browsing
on
the
fruit
under
the
flowering
trees
said
donna
maria
is
getting
late
holding
delfina
by
the
hand
she
walked
on
till
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
here
she
stopped
to
look
at
the
sea
which
catching
the
reflection
of
the
clouds
was
like
a
vast
undulating
glittering
sheet
of
silk
without
a
word
andrea
plucked
a
spray
of
blossom
so
full
that
the
twig
it
hung
from
bent
beneath
its
weight
and
offered
it
to
donna
maria
as
she
took
it
from
his
hand
she
looked
at
him
but
she
did
not
open
her
lips
they
passed
on
down
the
avenue
delfina
talking
talking
incessantly
repeating
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
infatuated
about
the
doe
inventing
long
monotonous
tales
in
which
she
ran
one
fairy
story
into
another
losing
herself
in
labyrinths
of
her
own
creation
as
if
the
sparkling
freshness
of
the
morning
air
had
gone
to
her
head
and
round
about
the
doe
she
grouped
the
children
of
the
king
cinderellas
fairy
queens
magicians
monsters
all
the
familiar
personages
of
those
imaginary
realms
crowding
them
in
tumultuously
with
the
kaleidoscopic
rapidity
of
a
dream
her
prattle
sounded
like
the
warbling
of
a
bird
full
of
sweet
modulations
with
now
and
then
a
rapid
succession
of
melodious
notes
that
were
not
words
a
continuation
of
the
wave
of
music
already
set
in
motion
like
the
vibrations
of
a
string
during
a
pause
when
in
the
childish
mind
the
connection
between
the
idea
and
its
verbal
expression
met
with
a
momentary
interruption
the
other
two
neither
spoke
nor
listened
to
them
the
little
twittering
covered
the
murmur
of
their
own
thoughts
and
if
delfina
stopped
for
a
moment
breathing
space
they
felt
as
strangely
perturbed
and
apprehensive
as
if
the
silence
might
disclose
or
lay
bare
their
souls
the
avenue
of
the
hundred
fountains
stretched
away
before
them
in
diminishing
perspective
a
peacock
perched
upon
one
of
the
shields
took
flight
at
their
approach
scattering
the
rose
leaves
into
a
fountain
below
a
few
steps
further
on
andrea
recognised
the
one
beside
which
donna
maria
had
stood
and
listened
to
the
music
of
the
waters
in
the
retreat
of
the
hermes
the
smell
of
musk
had
evaporated
the
statue
all
pensive
under
its
garland
was
flecked
with
patches
of
sunshine
which
filtered
through
the
surrounding
foliage
blackbirds
piped
and
answered
one
another
taken
with
a
sudden
fancy
delfina
exclaimed
i
want
the
wreath
again
leave
it
there
why
should
you
take
it
away
want
it
for
muriella
muriella
will
spoil
it
please
give
it
me
donna
maria
looked
at
andrea
he
slowly
went
up
to
the
statue
lifted
the
wreath
and
handed
it
to
delfina
in
the
exaltation
of
their
spirits
this
simple
little
episode
had
all
the
mysterious
significance
of
an
allegory
was
in
some
way
symbolical
one
of
his
own
lines
ran
persistently
in
andrea
head
i
attained
have
i
then
paid
the
price
the
nearer
they
approached
the
end
of
the
pathway
the
fiercer
grew
the
pain
at
his
heart
he
would
have
given
half
his
life
for
a
word
from
the
woman
he
loved
a
dozen
times
she
seemed
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
she
did
not
mamma
there
are
fernandino
and
muriella

delfina
catching
sight
of

she
started
off

towards

had
always
remained
faithful
to
her
girlhood
habit
of
setting
down
daily
in
her
journal
the
passing
thoughts
the
joys
the
sorrows
the
fancies
the
doubts
the
aspirations
the
regrets
and
the
hopes
all
the
events
of
her
spiritual
life
as
well
as
the
various
incidents
of
her
outward
existence
compiling
thereby
a
sort
of
itinerary
of
the
soul
which
she
liked
occasionally
to
study
both
for
guidance
on
the
path
still
to
be
pursued
and
also
to
follow
the
traces
of
things
long
dead
and
forgotten
perpetually
denied
by
force
of
circumstances
the
relief
of
enclosed
within
the
magic
circle
of
her
purity
as
in
a
tower
of
ivory
for
ever
incorruptible
and
inaccessible
she
found
solace
and
refreshment
in
the
daily
outpourings
she
confided
to
the
white
pages
of
her
private
book
therein
she
was
free
to
make
her
moan
to
abandon
herself
to
her
griefs
to
seek
to
decipher
the
enigma
of
her
own
heart
to
interrogate
her
conscience
here
she
gained
courage
in
prayer
tranquillised
herself
by
meditation
laid
her
troubled
spirit
once
more
in
the
hands
of
the
heavenly
father
and
from
every
page
shone
the
same
pure
light
the
light
of
truth
schifanoja
how
tired
i
feel
the
journey
was
rather
fatiguing
and
the
unaccustomed
sea
air
makes
my
head
ache
at
first
i
need
rest
and
i
already
seem
to
have
a
foretaste
of
the
sweetness
of
sleep
and
the
happiness
of
awaking
in
the
morning
in
the
house
of
a
friend
and
to
the
pleasures
of
francesca
cordial
hospitality
at
schifanoja
with
its
lovely
roses
and
its
tall
cypress
trees
i
shall
wake
up
to
the
knowledge
that
i
have
some
weeks
of
peace
before
me
twenty
days
perhaps
even
more
of
congenial
intellectual
companionship
i
am
very
grateful
to
francesca
for
her
invitation
to
see
her
again
was
like
meeting
a
sister
how
much
and
how
profoundly
i
have
changed
since
the
dear
old
days
in
florence
of
my
hair
francesca
began
recalling
stories
of
our
absurd
childish
passions
and
melancholies
in
those
days
of
carlotta
fiordelise
and
gabriella
vanni
and
various
incidents
of
that
distant
school
life
which
seems
to
me
now
as
though
i
had
never
lived
it
but
only
read
it
of
it
in
some
old
forgotten
book
or
seen
it
in
a
dream
my
hair
has
not
fallen
but
for
every
hair
of
my
head
there
has
been
a
thorn
in
my
destiny
why
let
my
sad
thoughts
get
the
upper
hand
over
me
again
and
why
let
memory
cause
me
pain
it
is
useless
to
lament
over
a
grave
which
never
gives
back
its
dead
would
to
heaven
i
could
remember
that
once
for
all
is
still
young
and
has
retained
the
frank
and
charming
gaiety
which
in
our
school
days
exercised
such
a
strange
fascination
over
my
somewhat
gloomy
temperament
she
has
one
great
and
rare
virtue
though
she
is
herself
she
can
enter
into
the
troubles
of
others
and
knows
how
to
lighten
them
by
her
kindly
sympathy
and
pity
she
is
above
all
things
a
woman
of
high
intelligence
and
refined
tastes
a
perfect
hostess
and
a
friend
who
never
palls
upon
one
she
is
perhaps
a
trifle
too
fond
of
witty
and
sparkling
epigrams
but
her
darts
are
always
tipped
with
gold
and
she
aims
them
with
inimitable
grace
among
all
the
women
of
the
great
world
i
have
ever
known
there
is
certainly
not
one
to
compare
with
her
and
of
all
my
friends
she
is
the
one
i
care
for
most
children
are
not
like
her
they
are
not
handsome
but
the
youngest
muriella
is
a
dear
little
thing
with
the
sweet
laugh
and
the
eyes
of
her
mother
she
did
the
honours
of
the
house
to
delfina
with
all
the
air
of
a
little
lady
she
has
certainly
inherited
her
mother
perfect
manner
seems
to
be
happy
she
has
already
explored
the
greater
part
of
the
grounds
as
far
as
the
sea
and
has
run
down
all
the
flights
of
steps
she
came
to
tell
me
about
all
the
wonderful
things
she
had
seen
panting
swallowing
half
the
words
her
eyes
looking
almost
dazzled
she
spoke
continually
of
her
new
friend
muriella
a
pretty
name
that
sounds
still
prettier
from
her
lips
is
fast
asleep
when
her
eyes
are
closed
her
lashes
cast
a
long
long
shadow
on
her
cheeks
francesca
cousin
was
struck
by
their
length
this
evening
and
quoted
a
beautiful
line
from
shakespeare
tempest
on
miranda
eyelashes
scent
of
the
flowers
is
too
strong
in
this
room
delfina
was
anxious
to
keep
the
bouquet
of
roses
by
her
bedside
but
now
that
she
is
asleep
i
shall
take
them
away
and
put
them
out
into
the
loggia
in
the
fresh
air
am
tired
and
yet
i
have
written
four
pages
i
am
sleepy
and
yet
i
would
gladly
prolong
this
languor
of
soul
lulled
by
i
know
not
what
unwonted
sense
of
tenderness
diffused
around
me
it
is
so
long
so
long
since
i
have
felt
myself
surrounded
by
a
little
kindness
have
just
carried
the
vase
of
roses
into
the
loggia
and
stayed
there
a
few
moments
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
the
night
moved
by
the
regret
of
losing
in
the
blindness
of
sleep
the
hours
that
pass
under
so
beautiful
a
sky
how
strange
is
the
harmony
between
the
song
of
the
fountains
and
the
murmur
of
the
sea
the
cypresses
seemed
to
be
the
pillars
of
the
firmament
the
stars
shining
just
above
them
tipped
their
summits
with
fire
a
delightful
afternoon
spent
almost
entirely
in
conversation
with
francesca
in
the
loggia
on
the
terraces
in
the
avenues
at
the
various
points
of
outlook
of
this
villa
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
built
by
a
princely
poet
to
drown
a
grief
the
name
of
the
palace
at
ferrara
suits
it
admirably
gave
me
a
sonnet
of
count
sperelli
to
read
a
trifle
but
of
rare
literary
charm
and
inscribed
on
vellum
sperelli
has
a
mind
of
a
very
high
order
and
is
most
intense
at
dinner
he
said
several
very
beautiful
things
he
is
recovering
from
a
terrible
wound
received
in
a
duel
in
rome
last
may
in
all
his
actions
his
looks
his
words
there
is
that
affectionate
and
charming
licence
which
is
the
prerogative
of
the
convalescent
of
those
who
have
newly
escaped
the
clutches
of
death
he
must
be
very
young
but
he
has
gone
through
much
and
lived
fast
he
bears
the
evidences
of
it
a
charming
evening
of
conversation
and
music
all
by
ourselves
after
dinner
i
talked
too
much
or
at
any
rate
with
two
much
eagerness
but
francesca
listened
and
encouraged
me
and
so
did
count
sperelli
that
is
just
the
delightful
part
of
a
conversation
not
on
common
subjects
to
feel
the
same
degree
of
warmth
animating
the
minds
of
all
present
only
then
do
one
words
have
the
true
ring
of
sincerity
and
give
real
pleasure
both
to
the
speaker
and
the
hearer
cousin
is
a
most
cultivated
judge
of
music
he
greatly
admires
the
masters
of
the
eighteenth
century
domenico
scarlatti
being
his
special
favourite
but
his
most
ardent
devotion
is
reserved
for
sebastian
bach
he
does
not
care
much
for
chopin
and
beethoven
affects
him
too
profoundly
and
perturbs
his
spirit
listened
to
me
with
a
singular
expression
almost
as
if
dazed
or
distressed
i
nearly
always
addressed
myself
to
francesca
but
i
felt
his
eyes
upon
me
with
an
insistence
which
embarrassed
but
did
not
offend
me
he
must
still
be
weak
and
ill
and
a
prey
to
his
nerves
finally
he
asked
me
do
you
sing
in
the
same
tone
in
which
he
would
have
said
do
you
love
me
sang
an
air
of
paisiello
and
another
by
salieri
and
i
played
a
little
eighteenth
century
music
i
was
in
good
voice
and
my
touch
on
the
piano
happy
gave
me
no
word
of
thanks
or
praise
but
remained
perfectly
silent
i
wonder
why
was
in
bed
by
that
time
when
i
went
upstairs
afterwards
to
see
her
i
found
her
asleep
but
with
her
eyelashes
wet
as
if
with
tears
poor
darling
dorothy
told
me
that
my
voice
could
be
heard
distinctly
up
here
and
that
delfina
had
wakened
from
her
first
sleep
and
begun
to
sob
and
wanted
to
come
down
is
asleep
again
now
but
from
time
to
time
her
little
bosom
heaves
with
a
suppressed
sob
which
sends
a
vague
distress
into
my
own
heart
and
a
desire
to
respond
to
that
involuntary
sob
to
this
grief
which
sleep
can
not
assuage
poor
darling
is
playing
the
piano
downstairs
i
wonder
with
the
soft
pedal
down
some
one
is
trying
over
that
gavotte
of
rameau
so
full
of
bewitching
melancholy
that
i
was
playing
just
now
who
can
it
be
francesca
came
up
with
me
it
is
late
went
out
and
leaned
over
the
loggia
the
room
opening
into
the
vestibule
is
dark
but
there
is
light
in
the
room
next
to
it
where
manuel
and
the
marchese
are
still
playing
cards
gavotte
has
stopped
some
one
is
going
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
should
i
be
so
alert
so
watchful
so
curious
why
should
every
sound
startle
me
has
wakened
and
is
calling
me
manuel
left
this
morning
we
accompanied
him
to
the
station
at
rovigliano
he
will
return
about
the
of
october
to
fetch
me
and
we
all
go
on
to
sienna
to
my
mother
delfina
and
i
will
probably
stay
at
sienna
till
after
the
new
year
i
shall
see
the
loggia
of
the
pope
and
the
fonte
gaja
and
my
beautiful
black
and
white
cathedral
once
more
that
beloved
of
the
blessed
virgin
where
a
part
of
my
soul
has
ever
remained
to
pray
in
a
spot
that
my
knees
know
well
always
have
a
vision
of
that
spot
clearly
before
me
and
when
i
go
back
i
shall
kneel
on
the
exact
stone
where
i
always
used
to
i
know
it
as
well
as
if
my
knees
had
left
a
deep
hollow
there
and
there
too
i
shall
find
that
portion
of
my
soul
which
still
lingers
there
in
prayer
beneath
the
starry
blue
vault
above
which
is
mirrored
in
the
marble
floor
like
a
midnight
sky
in
a
placid
lake
nothing
there
is
changed
in
the
costly
chapel
full
of
palpitating
shadow
and
mysterious
gloom
alive
with
the
glint
of
precious
marble
the
lamps
burned
softly
all
their
light
seemingly
gathered
into
the
little
globe
of
oil
that
fed
the
flame
as
into
some
limpid
topaz
little
by
little
under
my
intent
gaze
the
sculptured
stone
grew
less
coldly
white
took
on
warm
ivory
tints
became
gradually
penetrated
by
the
pallid
life
of
the
celestial
beings
and
over
the
marble
forms
crept
the
faint
transparency
of
angelic
flesh
how
fervent
and
spontaneous
were
my
prayers
then
when
i
absorbed
myself
in
meditation
i
seemed
to
be
walking
through
the
secret
paths
of
my
soul
as
in
a
garden
of
delight
where
nightingales
sang
in
the
blossoming
trees
and
cooed
beside
the
running
waters
of
grace
divine
a
day
of
nameless
torture
something
seems
to
be
forcing
me
to
gather
up
to
to
join
together
the
fragments
of
a
dream
half
of
which
is
being
confusedly
realised
outside
of
me
and
the
other
half
going
on
equally
confusedly
in
my
own
heart
and
try
as
i
will
i
can
not
succeed
in
piecing
it
completely
together
continued
torture
long
ago
some
one
sang
to
me
but
never
finished
the
song
now
some
one
is
taking
up
the
strain
at
the
point
where
it
broke
off
but
meanwhile
i
have
forgotten
the
beginning
and
my
spirit
loses
itself
in
vain
gropings
after
the
old
melody
nor
can
it
find
any
pleasure
in
the
new
after
lunch
andrea
sperelli
invited
me
and
francesca
to
come
to
his
room
and
look
at
some
drawings
that
had
arrived
for
him
yesterday
from
rome
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
an
entire
art
has
passed
before
our
eyes
an
art
studied
and
analysed
by
the
hand
of
a
master
draughtsman
i
have
never
experienced
a
more
intense
pleasure
drawings
are
sperelli
own
work
studies
sketches
notes
mementos
of
every
gallery
in
europe
they
are
so
to
speak
his
breviary
a
wonderful
breviary
in
which
each
of
the
old
masters
has
his
special
page
affording
a
condensed
example
of
his
manner
bringing
out
the
most
lofty
and
original
beauties
of
his
work
the
of
his
entire
productions
in
going
through
the
large
collection
not
only
have
i
received
a
distinct
impression
of
the
various
schools
the
movements
the
influences
which
have
combined
to
develop
the
art
of
painting
in
various
countries
but
i
feel
that
i
have
had
a
glimpse
into
the
spirit
the
essential
meaning
of
the
art
of
each
individual
painter
i
am
as
if
intoxicated
with
art
my
brain
is
full
of
lines
and
figures
but
in
the
midst
of
the
apparent
confusion
there
stand
out
clearly
before
me
the
women
of
the
early
masters
those
heads
of
saints
and
virgins
which
smiled
down
upon
my
childish
piety
in
old
sienna
from
the
frescoes
of
taddeo
and
simone
masterpiece
of
art
however
advanced
and
brilliant
leaves
upon
the
mind
so
strong
and
enduring
an
impression
all
these
slender
forms
delicate
and
drooping
as
these
grave
and
noble
attitudes
for
receiving
a
flower
offered
by
an
angel
placing
the
fingers
on
an
open
book
bending
over
the
holy
infant
or
supporting
the
body
of
christ
in
the
act
of
blessing
of
agonising
of
ascending
into
heaven
all
these
things
so
pure
so
sincere
so
profoundly
touching
affect
the
soul
to
its
depths
and
imprint
themselves
for
ever
on
the
memory
one
by
one
the
women
of
the
early
masters
passed
in
review
before
us
francesca
and
i
were
seated
on
a
low
couch
with
a
great
stand
before
us
on
which
lay
the
portfolio
containing
the
drawings
which
the
artist
seated
opposite
slowly
turned
over
commenting
on
each
in
succession
i
watched
his
hand
as
he
took
up
a
sheet
and
placed
it
with
peculiar
care
on
the
other
side
of
the
portfolio
and
each
time
i
felt
a
sort
of
thrill
as
if
that
hand
were
going
to
touch
me
why
his
position
doubtless
becoming
uncomfortable
he
knelt
on
the
floor
and
in
that
attitude
continued
turning
over
the
drawings
in
speaking
he
nearly
always
addressed
himself
to
me
not
at
all
with
the
air
of
imparting
instruction
but
as
if
discussing
the
pictures
with
a
person
as
familiar
with
the
subject
as
he
was
himself
and
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
complacency
mingled
with
gratitude
whenever
i
exclaimed
in
admiration
he
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
which
i
can
still
see
but
can
not
define
two
or
three
times
francesca
rested
her
arm
on
his
shoulder
in
unconscious
familiarity
looking
at
the
head
of
the
of
moses
copied
from
fresco
in
the
sistine
chapel
she
said
it
has
a
look
of
you
when
you
are
in
one
of
your
melancholy
moods
and
when
we
came
to
the
head
of
the
archangel
michael
from
perugino
madonna
of
pavia
she
remarked
it
is
a
little
like
giulia
moceto
is
it
not
he
did
not
answer
but
only
turned
the
page
over
rather
sooner
than
usual
upon
which
she
added
with
a
laugh
away
with
the
pictures
of
sin
giulia
moceto
is
i
suppose
some
one
he
was
once
in
love
with
the
page
once
turned
i
had
a
wild
unreasoning
desire
to
look
at
the
michael
again
and
examine
the
face
more
closely
was
it
merely
artistic
curiosity
can
not
say
i
dare
not
pry
into
my
heart
i
prefer
to
temporise
to
deceive
myself
i
have
not
the
courage
to
face
the
battle
i
am
a
coward
yet
the
present
is
so
sweet
my
imagination
is
as
excited
as
if
i
had
drunk
strong
tea
i
have
no
desire
to
go
to
bed
the
night
is
soft
and
warm
as
if
it
were
august
the
sky
is
cloudless
but
dimly
veiled
the
breathing
of
the
sea
comes
slow
and
deep
but
the
fountains
fill
up
the
pauses
the
loggia
attracts
me
shall
we
go
out
and
dream
a
little
my
heart
and
i
dream
of
what
eyes
of
the
virgins
and
the
saints
pursue
me
long
and
narrow
with
meekly
downcast
lids
from
under
which
they
gaze
at
one
with
that
charmed
look
innocent
as
the
dove
and
yet
a
little
like
the
serpent
be
ye
harmless
as
doves
and
wise
as
serpents
said
our
lord
be
wise
go
say
your
prayers
and
then
to
bed
and
sleep
alas
must
the
heavy
task
ever
painfully
begin
again
from
the
beginning
the
steep
path
be
climbed
the
battle
that
was
won
fought
over
again
he
has
given
me
one
of
his
poems
story
of
the
the
of
the
copies
printed
on
vellum
and
with
two
proof
engravings
of
the
frontispiece
is
a
remarkable
work
enclosing
a
mystic
and
profound
idea
although
the
musical
element
predominates
entrancing
the
soul
by
the
unfamiliar
magic
of
its
melody
which
envelopes
the
thoughts
that
shine
out
like
a
glister
of
gold
and
diamonds
through
a
limpid
stream
certain
lines
pursue
me
incessantly
and
will
continue
to
do
so
for
long
no
doubt
they
are
so
intense
every
day
and
every
hour
he
subjugates
me
more
and
more
mind
and
soul
against
my
will
despite
my
resistance
his
every
word
and
look
his
slightest
action
sinks
into
my
heart
when
we
converse
with
one
another
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
his
voice
were
an
echo
of
my
soul
at
times
a
sudden
wild
frenzy
comes
over
me
a
blind
desire
an
unreasoning
impulse
to
make
some
remark
utter
some
word
that
would
betray
my
secret
weakness
i
only
save
myself
from
it
by
a
miracle
and
then
there
falls
an
interval
of
silence
during
which
i
am
shaken
with
inward
terror
then
when
i
do
speak
again
it
is
to
say
something
trivial
in
the
lightest
tone
i
can
command
but
i
feel
as
if
a
flame
were
rushing
over
my
face
that
i
am
going
to
blush
if
he
were
to
seize
this
moment
to
look
me
boldly
in
the
eyes
i
should
be
lost
played
a
good
deal
this
evening
chiefly
bach
and
schumann
as
on
the
first
evening
he
sat
in
a
low
chair
to
the
right
but
a
little
behind
me
from
time
to
time
at
the
end
of
each
piece
he
rose
and
leaned
over
me
turning
the
pages
to
point
out
another
fugue
or
intermezzo
then
he
would
sit
down
again
and
listen
motionless
profoundly
absorbed
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
forcing
me
to
his
presence
he
understand
i
wonder
how
much
of
myself
of
my
thoughts
and
griefs
found
voice
in
the
music
of
others
is
a
threatening
night
a
hot
moist
wind
blows
over
the
garden
and
its
dull
moaning
dies
away
in
the
darkness
only
to
begin
again
more
loudly
the
tops
of
the
cypresses
wave
to
and
fro
under
an
almost
inky
sky
in
which
the
stars
burn
with
feeble
ray
a
band
of
clouds
spans
the
heavens
from
side
to
side
ragged
contorted
blacker
than
the
sky
like
the
tragic
locks
of
a
medusa
the
sea
is
invisible
through
the
darkness
but
it
sobs
as
if
in
measureless
and
uncontrollable
grief
forsaken
and
alone
this
unreasoning
terror
the
night
seems
to
warn
me
of
approaching
disaster
a
warning
that
finds
its
echo
in
a
dim
remorse
within
my
heart
i
always
take
comfort
from
my
daughter
she
heals
my
fever
like
some
blessed
balm
is
asleep
now
shaded
from
the
lamp
which
shines
with
the
soft
radiance
of
the
moon
her
face
white
with
dewy
freshness
of
a
white
rose
seems
half
buried
in
the
masses
of
her
dark
hair
one
would
think
the
eyelids
were
too
delicately
transparent
to
veil
the
splendour
of
her
eyes
as
i
lean
over
her
and
gaze
at
her
all
the
sinister
voices
of
the
night
are
silenced
for
me
and
the
silence
is
measured
only
by
her
gentle
respiration
feels
the
vicinity
of
her
mother
the
longer
i
contemplate
her
the
more
does
she
assume
in
my
eyes
the
aspect
of
some
ethereal
creature
of
a
being
formed
of
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
shall
grow
up
nourished
and
enwrapped
by
the
flame
of
my
love
of
my
great
my
love
i
can
form
no
resolve
i
can
decide
upon
no
plan
of
action
i
am
simply
abandoning
myself
a
little
to
this
new
sentiment
shutting
my
eyes
to
the
distant
peril
and
my
ears
to
the
warning
voice
of
conscience
with
the
shuddering
temerity
of
one
who
in
gathering
violets
ventures
too
near
the
edge
of
a
precipice
at
the
foot
of
which
roars
a
hungry
torrent
shall
never
know
anything
from
my
lips
i
shall
never
know
anything
from
his
our
two
souls
will
mount
together
for
a
brief
space
to
the
of
the
ideal
will
drink
side
by
side
at
the
perennial
fountains
and
then
each
go
on
its
separate
way
encouraged
and
refreshed
still
the
air
is
this
afternoon
the
sea
has
the
faint
tints
of
the
opal
of
murano
glass
with
here
and
there
a
patch
like
a
mirror
dimmed
by
a
breath
am
reading
shelley
a
favourite
poet
with
him
that
divine
ariel
feeding
upon
light
and
speaking
with
the
tongues
of
angels
it
is
night
dio
mio
dio
his
voice
when
he
spoke
my
name
the
tremor
in
it
oh
i
thought
my
heart
was
breaking
in
my
bosom
and
that
i
must
inevitably
lose
you
will
never
know
he
said
never
know
how
utterly
my
soul
is
yours
were
in
the
avenue
of
the
fountains
i
was
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
water
but
from
that
moment
i
heard
nothing
more
everything
around
me
seemed
to
flee
away
carrying
my
life
with
it
and
the
earth
to
open
beneath
my
feet
i
made
a
superhuman
effort
to
control
myself
name
rose
to
my
lips
and
i
was
seized
with
a
wild
impulse
to
fly
to
her
for
protection
for
safety
three
times
i
cried
that
name
but
in
the
intervals
my
heart
ceased
to
beat
and
the
breath
died
away
upon
my
lips
was
it
true
was
it
not
merely
some
illusion
of
my
overwrought
and
distracted
spirit
why
should
that
hour
yesterday
seem
to
me
so
far
away
so
spoke
a
second
time
at
greater
length
close
to
my
side
while
i
walked
on
under
the
trees
as
in
a
under
the
trees
was
it
it
seemed
to
me
rather
that
i
was
walking
through
the
hidden
pathways
of
my
soul
among
flowers
born
of
my
imagination
listening
to
the
words
of
an
invisible
spirit
that
yet
was
part
of
myself
can
still
hear
the
sweet
and
dreadful
words
i
would
renounce
all
that
the
future
may
hold
for
me
to
live
in
a
small
corner
of
your
heart
far
from
the
world
wholly
lost
in
the
thought
of
you
until
death
to
all
eternity
and
again
pity
from
you
would
be
far
dearer
to
me
than
love
from
any
other
woman
your
mere
presence
suffices
to
intoxicate
me
i
feel
it
flowing
into
my
veins
like
my
life
blood
and
filling
my
soul
with
rapture
beyond
all
telling
when
he
gathered
the
spray
of
blossom
at
the
entrance
to
the
wood
and
offered
it
to
me
did
i
not
in
my
heart
call
him
of
my
in
the
avenue
we
passed
again
by
the
fountain
where
he
first
spoke
to
me
did
i
not
call
him
of
my
he
took
the
wreath
from
off
the
hermes
and
gave
it
back
to
my
child
did
he
not
give
me
to
understand
that
the
woman
exalted
in
these
verses
had
fallen
from
her
high
estate
and
that
i
i
alone
was
all
his
hope
and
once
more
i
called
him
of
my
how
long
i
have
been
in
finding
peace
that
moment
onwards
what
hours
of
struggle
and
travail
i
have
had
how
painfully
i
have
striven
to
penetrate
the
real
state
of
my
mind
to
see
things
in
their
true
light
bring
a
calm
and
fair
judgment
to
bear
upon
what
has
happened
to
recognise
and
determine
upon
my
duty
but
i
continually
evaded
myself
my
mind
became
confused
my
will
was
but
a
broken
reed
on
which
to
lean
every
effort
was
vain
by
a
sort
of
instinct
i
have
avoided
being
alone
with
him
kept
close
to
francesca
or
my
child
or
stayed
here
in
my
room
as
in
a
haven
of
refuge
when
my
eyes
did
meet
his
i
seemed
to
read
in
them
a
profound
and
imploring
sadness
does
he
not
know
how
deeply
deeply
deeply
i
love
him
does
not
know
it
nor
ever
will
that
is
my
firm
resolve
that
is
my
duty
courage
me
oh
my
god
why
did
he
speak
why
did
he
break
the
enchanted
silence
in
which
i
let
my
soul
be
steeped
almost
without
regret
or
fear
why
tear
away
the
veil
of
uncertainty
and
put
me
face
to
face
with
his
unveiled
love
now
i
have
no
further
excuse
for
temporising
for
deluding
myself
the
danger
is
there
certain
undeniable
manifest
it
attracts
me
to
its
dizzy
edge
like
a
precipice
one
moment
of
weakness
of
languor
and
i
am
lost
ask
myself
am
i
sincere
in
my
pain
and
regret
at
this
unexpected
revelation
how
is
it
that
i
think
perpetually
of
those
words
and
why
when
i
repeat
them
to
myself
does
a
wave
of
ineffable
rapture
sweep
over
my
soul
why
do
i
thrill
to
the
heart
core
at
the
imagined
prospect
of
hearing
more
more
such
words
the
agitation
of
my
soul
takes
the
forms
of
questions
riddles
i
ask
myself
endless
questions
to
which
i
never
have
an
answer
i
have
not
had
the
courage
to
look
myself
through
and
through
to
form
a
really
bold
and
honest
resolution
i
am
pusillanimous
i
am
a
coward
i
shrink
from
pain
i
want
to
suffer
as
little
as
possible
i
prefer
to
temporise
to
hang
back
to
resort
to
subterfuges
to
wilfully
blind
myself
instead
of
courageously
facing
the
risks
of
a
decisive
battle
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
that
i
am
of
being
alone
with
him
of
having
a
serious
conversation
with
him
and
so
my
life
is
reduced
to
a
series
of
petty
schemes
and
manoeuvrings
and
pretexts
for
avoiding
his
company
such
devices
are
unworthy
of
me
either
i
must
renounce
this
love
altogether
and
he
shall
hear
my
sad
but
firm
resolve
or
i
shall
accept
it
in
so
far
as
it
is
pure
and
he
will
receive
my
spiritual
consent
now
i
ask
myself
what
do
i
really
want
which
of
the
two
paths
am
i
to
choose
must
i
renounce
shall
i
accept
god
my
god
answer
thou
for
me
light
up
the
path
before
me
renounce
is
like
tearing
out
a
piece
of
my
heart
with
my
own
hands
the
agony
would
be
supreme
the
wrench
would
exceed
the
limits
of
the
endurable
but
by
god
grace
such
heroism
would
be
crowned
by
resignation
would
be
rewarded
by
that
sweet
and
holy
calm
which
follows
upon
every
high
moral
impulse
every
victory
of
the
soul
over
the
dread
of
suffering
shall
renounce
my
daughter
shall
keep
possession
of
my
whole
life
of
my
whole
soul
that
is
the
path
of
duty
and
i
will
walk
in
it
in
tears
oh
mourning
souls
that
ye
may
reap
with
songs
of
gladness
i
feel
somewhat
calmer
in
writing
these
pages
i
regain
at
least
for
the
moment
some
slight
balance
of
mind
i
can
look
my
misfortune
more
clearly
in
the
face
and
my
heart
seems
relieved
as
if
after
confession
if
i
could
but
go
to
confession
could
implore
counsel
and
help
of
my
old
friend
and
comforter
dom
luigi
sustains
me
most
of
all
in
my
tribulation
is
the
thought
that
in
a
short
time
i
shall
see
him
again
and
be
able
to
pour
out
all
my
griefs
and
fears
to
him
show
him
all
my
wounds
ask
of
him
a
balm
for
all
my
ills
as
i
used
to
in
the
days
when
his
benign
and
solemn
words
would
call
up
tears
of
tenderness
to
my
eyes
that
knew
not
then
the
bitterness
of
other
tears
or
more
terrible
by
far
the
burning
pain
of
misery
he
understand
me
still
can
he
fathom
the
deep
anguish
of
the
woman
as
he
understood
the
vague
and
fitful
melancholy
of
the
girl
shall
i
ever
again
see
him
lean
towards
me
in
pity
and
consolation
that
gentle
brow
crowned
with
silvery
locks
illumined
with
purity
and
holiness
and
sanctified
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
the
chapel
after
mass
i
played
on
the
organ
music
of
bach
and
of
cherubini
i
played
the
same
prelude
as
the
other
evening
soul
weeps
and
moans
weighed
down
with
anguish
weeps
and
moans
and
cries
to
god
asking
his
pardon
imploring
his
aid
with
a
prayer
that
rises
to
heaven
like
a
tongue
of
fire
it
cries
and
it
is
heard
its
prayer
is
answered
it
receives
light
from
above
utters
songs
of
gladness
reaches
at
length
the
haven
of
peace
and
truth
and
rests
in
the
lord
organ
is
not
large
nor
is
the
chapel
but
nevertheless
my
soul
expanded
as
in
a
basilica
soared
up
as
under
some
vast
dome
and
touched
the
pinnacle
of
high
heaven
where
blazes
the
sign
of
signs
in
the
azure
of
paradise
in
the
sublime
ether
alas
nothing
is
of
any
avail
nothing
gives
me
one
hour
one
minute
one
second
respite
nothing
can
ever
cure
me
no
dream
of
my
mind
can
ever
efface
the
dream
of
my
all
has
been
in
vain
this
anguish
is
killing
me
i
feel
that
my
hurt
is
mortal
my
heart
pains
me
as
if
some
one
were
actually
crushing
it
were
tearing
it
to
pieces
my
agony
of
mind
is
so
great
that
it
has
become
a
physical
torment
atrocious
unbearable
i
know
perfectly
well
that
i
am
overwrought
nervous
the
victim
of
a
sort
of
madness
but
i
can
not
get
the
upper
hand
over
myself
can
not
pull
myself
together
can
not
regain
control
of
my
reason
i
can
not
i
simply
can
not
this
then
is
love
went
off
somewhere
this
morning
on
horseback
accompanied
by
a
servant
before
i
saw
him
and
i
spent
the
whole
morning
in
the
chapel
when
lunch
time
came
he
had
not
returned
his
absence
caused
me
such
misery
that
i
myself
was
astonished
at
the
violence
of
my
pain
i
came
up
to
my
room
afterwards
and
to
ease
my
heart
i
wrote
a
page
of
my
journal
a
devotional
page
seeking
to
revive
my
fainting
spirit
at
the
glowing
memory
of
my
girlhood
faith
then
i
read
a
few
pieces
here
and
there
of
shelley
after
which
i
went
down
into
the
park
looking
for
delfina
but
no
matter
what
i
did
the
thought
of
him
was
ever
present
with
me
held
me
captive
and
tortured
me
relentlessly
at
last
i
heard
his
voice
again
i
was
on
the
first
terrace
he
was
speaking
to
francesca
in
the
vestibule
she
came
out
and
called
to
me
to
come
up
felt
my
knees
giving
way
beneath
me
at
each
step
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
and
he
must
have
noticed
the
trembling
of
mine
for
i
saw
a
sudden
gleam
flash
into
his
eyes
we
all
three
sat
down
on
low
cane
lounges
in
the
vestibule
facing
the
sea
he
complained
of
feeling
very
tired
and
smoked
while
he
told
us
of
his
ride
he
had
gone
as
far
as
vicomile
where
he
had
made
a
halt
he
said
possesses
three
wonderful
treasures
a
pine
wood
a
tower
and
a
monstrance
imagine
a
pine
wood
between
the
sea
and
the
hill
interspersed
by
a
number
of
pools
that
multiply
the
trees
indefinitely
a
campanile
in
the
old
rugged
lombardy
style
that
goes
back
to
the
eleventh
century
a
of
stone
as
it
were
covered
with
sculptured
sirens
and
peacocks
serpents
and
griffins
and
dragons
a
thousand
and
one
monsters
and
flowers
and
a
monstrance
all
enamelled
engraved
and
chased
in
style
and
form
with
a
foretaste
of
renaissance
the
work
of
gallucci
an
almost
unknown
artist
but
who
was
the
great
forerunner
of
benvenuto
cellini
addressed
himself
all
the
time
to
me
strange
how
exactly
i
remember
every
word
he
says
i
could
set
down
any
conversation
of
his
word
for
word
from
beginning
to
end
if
there
were
any
means
of
doing
so
i
could
reproduce
every
modulation
of
his
voice
showed
us
two
or
three
little
sketches
he
had
made
and
then
began
again
describing
the
wonders
of
vicomile
with
that
warmth
with
which
he
always
speaks
of
beautiful
things
and
that
enthusiasm
for
art
which
is
one
of
his
most
potent
attractions
i
promised
the
canonico
to
come
back
we
will
all
go
will
we
not
francesca
donna
maria
ought
to
see
vicomile
my
name
on
his
lips
if
it
were
possible
i
could
reproduce
the
very
movements
of
his
lips
in
uttering
each
syllable
of
those
two
words
donna
maria
but
what
i
never
could
express
is
my
own
emotion
on
hearing
it
could
never
explain
the
unknown
sensation
awakened
in
me
by
the
presence
of
this
man
sat
there
till
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
francesca
seemed
a
little
pensive
and
out
of
spirits
there
were
moments
when
heavy
silence
fell
upon
us
but
between
him
and
me
there
then
occurred
one
of
those
in
which
the
soul
exhales
the
ineffable
and
hears
the
murmur
of
its
thoughts
he
said
things
to
me
then
that
made
me
sink
back
against
the
cushions
of
my
chair
faint
with
rapture
things
that
his
lips
will
never
repeat
to
me
that
my
ears
will
never
hear
front
of
us
the
cypresses
tipped
with
fire
by
the
setting
sun
stood
up
tall
and
motionless
like
votive
candles
the
sea
was
the
colour
of
aloe
leaves
dashed
here
and
there
with
liquid
turquoise
there
was
an
indescribable
delicacy
of
varying
pallor
a
diffusion
of
angelic
light
in
which
each
sail
looked
like
an
angel
wing
upon
the
waters
and
the
harmony
of
faint
and
mingled
perfumes
seemed
like
the
soul
of
the
declining
day
sweet
and
tranquil
death
of
september
month
ended
lost
dropped
away
into
the
abyss
of
time
farewell
have
lived
more
in
this
last
fortnight
than
in
fourteen
years
and
not
one
of
my
long
weeks
of
unhappiness
has
ever
equalled
in
sharpness
of
torture
this
one
short
week
of
passion
my
heart
aches
my
head
swims
in
the
depths
of
my
being
i
feel
a
something
obscure
and
burning
a
something
that
has
suddenly
awakened
in
me
like
a
latent
disease
and
now
begins
to
creep
through
my
blood
and
into
my
soul
in
spite
of
myself
baffling
every
remedy
desire
fills
me
with
shame
and
horror
as
at
some
dishonour
some
sacrilege
or
outrage
it
fills
me
with
wild
and
desperate
terror
as
at
some
treacherous
enemy
who
will
make
use
of
secret
paths
to
enter
the
citadel
which
are
unknown
to
myself
here
i
sit
in
the
night
watches
and
while
i
write
these
pages
with
all
the
feverish
ardour
that
lovers
put
into
their
i
cease
to
listen
to
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
child
she
sleeps
in
peace
she
little
knows
how
far
away
from
her
her
mother
spirit
is
i
see
much
in
him
that
i
did
not
observe
before
when
he
speaks
i
can
not
take
my
eyes
off
his
mouth
the
play
of
his
lips
and
their
colouring
occupies
my
attention
more
than
the
sound
or
the
sense
of
his
words
is
saturday
just
a
week
since
the
day
the
of
september
some
strange
chance
although
i
no
longer
avoid
being
alone
with
him
for
i
am
anxious
now
for
the
dread
and
heroical
moment
by
some
strange
chance
that
moment
has
not
yet
occurred
has
always
been
with
me
the
whole
day
long
this
morning
we
had
a
ride
along
the
road
to
rovigliano
and
we
spent
the
best
part
of
the
afternoon
at
the
piano
she
made
me
play
some
dance
music
and
then
clementi
famous
toccata
and
two
or
three
caprices
of
scarlatti
and
after
that
i
had
to
sing
certain
songs
from
schumann
what
contrasts
has
lost
much
of
her
old
gaiety
she
is
not
as
she
used
to
be
in
the
first
days
of
my
stay
here
she
is
often
silent
and
preoccupied
and
when
she
does
laugh
or
make
fun
her
gaiety
seems
to
me
very
forced
i
said
to
her
once
is
something
worrying
you
why
she
answered
with
assumed
surprise
because
you
seem
to
me
a
little
out
of
spirits
lately
out
of
spirits
oh
no
you
are
quite
mistaken
she
answered
and
she
laughed
but
with
an
involuntary
note
of
bitterness
this
troubles
me
and
causes
me
a
vague
sense
of
uneasiness
are
going
to
vicomile
afternoon
asked
me
would
it
tire
you
too
much
to
come
on
horseback
in
that
way
we
could
cut
right
through
the
pine
wood
we
are
going
to
ride
and
francesca
will
join
us
the
others
including
delfina
will
come
in
the
a
strange
state
of
mind
i
am
in
this
evening
i
feel
a
kind
of
dull
and
angry
bitterness
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
without
knowing
why
am
impatient
with
myself
my
life
the
whole
world
my
nervous
irritation
rises
at
times
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
am
seized
with
an
insane
desire
to
scream
aloud
to
dig
my
nails
into
my
flesh
to
bruise
my
fingers
against
the
wall
any
physical
suffering
would
be
better
than
this
intolerable
mental
discomfort
this
unbearable
wretchedness
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
burning
knot
in
my
bosom
that
my
throat
were
closed
by
a
sob
i
dared
not
give
vent
to
i
am
icy
cold
and
burning
hot
by
turns
and
from
time
to
time
a
sudden
pang
darts
through
me
an
irrational
terror
that
i
can
neither
shake
off
nor
control
thoughts
and
images
flash
suddenly
across
my
brain
coming
from
i
know
not
what
ignoble
depths
of
my
soul
how
weak
and
miserable
is
the
human
soul
how
utterly
defenceless
against
the
attacks
of
all
that
is
least
noble
and
least
pure
in
us
and
that
slumbers
in
the
obscurity
of
our
unconscious
life
in
those
unexplored
abysses
where
dark
dreams
are
born
of
hidden
sensations
dream
can
poison
a
whole
soul
a
single
involuntary
thought
is
sufficient
to
corrupt
and
break
down
the
force
of
will
are
just
starting
for
vicomile
delfina
is
in
raptures
is
the
festival
of
our
lady
of
the
rosary
courage
my
heart
i
found
no
courage
was
so
full
of
trifling
incidents
and
great
emotions
so
joyful
and
so
sad
so
strangely
agitating
that
i
am
almost
at
a
loss
when
i
try
to
remember
it
all
and
yet
all
all
other
recollections
pale
and
vanish
before
the
one
having
visited
the
tower
and
admired
the
monstrance
we
prepared
to
return
home
at
about
five
francesca
was
tired
and
preferred
going
back
in
the
coach
to
getting
on
horseback
again
we
followed
them
for
a
while
riding
behind
or
beside
them
while
delfina
and
muriella
waved
long
flowering
bulrushes
at
us
laughing
and
threatening
us
with
their
splendid
spears
evening
was
calm
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
hill
at
rovigliano
in
a
sky
all
like
a
sunset
in
the
far
east
we
came
in
sight
of
the
he
suddenly
said
to
me
shall
we
ride
through
it
high
road
skirted
the
wood
describing
a
wide
curve
at
one
part
of
which
it
almost
touched
the
the
wood
was
already
growing
dark
and
was
full
of
twilight
but
under
the
trees
the
pools
gleamed
with
a
pure
and
intense
light
like
fragments
of
a
sky
far
fairer
than
the
one
above
our
heads
giving
me
time
to
answer
he
said
to
francesca
we
are
going
to
ride
through
the
wood
and
shall
join
you
at
the
other
side
on
the
high
road
by
the
bridge
and
he
reined
in
his
horse
did
i
consent
why
did
i
follow
him
there
was
a
sort
of
dazzle
before
my
eyes
i
felt
as
if
i
were
under
the
influence
of
some
nameless
fascination
as
if
the
landscape
the
light
this
incident
the
whole
combination
of
circumstances
were
not
new
to
me
but
things
that
had
all
happened
to
me
before
in
another
existence
and
were
now
only
being
repeated
the
impression
is
quite
indescribable
my
will
seemed
paralysed
it
was
as
when
some
incident
of
one
life
reappears
in
a
dream
but
with
added
details
that
differ
from
the
real
circumstances
i
shall
never
be
able
to
adequately
describe
even
a
part
of
this
strange
phenomenon
rode
in
silence
at
a
foot
pace
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
the
dull
beat
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
their
noisy
breathing
in
no
way
disturbed
the
peace
that
seemed
to
grow
every
minute
deeper
and
more
magical
why
did
he
break
the
spell
we
ourselves
had
woven
began
to
speak
he
poured
out
upon
me
a
flood
of
burning
words
words
which
in
the
silence
of
the
wood
frightened
me
because
they
carried
with
them
an
impression
of
something
preternatural
something
indefinably
weird
and
compelling
he
was
no
longer
the
humble
suppliant
of
that
morning
in
the
park
spoke
no
more
of
his
diffident
hopes
his
aspirations
his
incurable
sense
of
sorrow
this
time
he
did
not
beg
and
entreat
it
was
the
voice
of
passion
full
of
audacity
and
virile
power
a
voice
i
did
not
know
in
him
you
love
me
you
love
me
you
can
not
help
but
love
me
tell
me
that
you
love
me
horse
was
close
beside
mine
i
felt
him
brush
me
i
almost
felt
the
breath
of
his
burning
words
upon
my
cheek
and
i
thought
i
must
swoon
with
anguish
and
fall
into
his
arms
tell
me
that
you
love
me
he
repeated
obstinately
relentlessly
tell
me
that
you
love
me
the
terrible
strain
of
his
insistent
voice
i
believe
i
answered
wildly
whether
with
a
cry
or
a
sob
i
do
not
know
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
i
set
my
horse
at
a
gallop
down
the
narrow
rugged
path
between
the
crowded
unconscious
of
what
i
was
doing
followed
me
crying
maria
maria
stop
you
will
hurt
yourself
i
fled
blindly
on
i
do
not
know
how
my
horse
managed
to
keep
clear
of
the
trees
i
do
not
know
why
i
was
not
thrown
i
am
incapable
of
retracing
my
impressions
in
that
mad
flight
through
the
dark
wood
past
the
gleaming
patches
of
water
when
at
last
i
came
out
upon
the
road
near
the
bridge
i
seemed
to
have
come
out
of
some
hallucination
do
you
want
to
kill
yourself
he
said
almost
fiercely
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
approaching
carriage
and
turned
to
meet
it
he
was
going
to
speak
to
me
again
hush
for
pity
sake
i
entreated
for
i
felt
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
forces
was
silent
then
with
an
assurance
that
stupefied
me
he
said
to
francesca
such
a
pity
you
did
not
come
it
was
perfectly
enchanting
he
went
on
talking
as
quietly
and
unconcernedly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
even
with
a
certain
amount
of
gaiety
i
was
only
too
thankful
for
his
dissimulation
which
screened
me
for
if
i
had
been
obliged
to
speak
i
should
inevitably
have
betrayed
myself
and
for
both
of
us
to
have
been
silent
would
doubtless
have
aroused
francesca
suspicions
little
further
on
the
road
wound
up
the
hill
towards
schifanoja
oh
the
boundless
melancholy
of
the
evening
a
new
moon
shone
in
the
sky
where
my
eyes
and
perhaps
mine
alone
detected
a
lingering
rosy
tinge
that
same
rosy
light
that
gleamed
upon
the
pools
down
in
the
pine
wood
he
knows
now
that
i
love
him
and
knows
it
from
my
own
lips
nothing
is
left
for
me
but
flight
this
is
what
i
have
come
to
he
looks
at
me
now
there
is
a
strange
gleam
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
that
was
not
there
before
while
francesca
was
absent
for
a
moment
he
took
my
hand
and
made
as
if
he
would
kiss
it
i
managed
to
draw
it
away
but
i
saw
his
lips
tremble
i
caught
as
it
were
the
reflection
of
the
kiss
that
never
left
his
lips
and
the
image
of
that
kiss
haunts
me
now
it
haunts
me
haunts
me
on
the
of
september
on
the
marble
seat
in
the
arbutus
wood
he
said
to
me
i
know
you
do
not
love
me
and
that
you
never
will
love
me
and
on
the
of
october
you
love
me
you
love
me
you
can
not
help
but
love
me
francesca
presence
he
asked
if
i
would
allow
him
to
make
a
study
of
my
hands
and
i
consented
he
will
begin
am
nervous
and
frightened
as
if
i
were
going
to
expose
my
hands
to
some
nameless
ordeal
it
has
begun
the
slow
sweet
unspeakable
torture
drew
with
red
and
black
chalk
my
right
hand
lay
on
a
piece
of
velvet
near
me
on
the
table
stood
a
corean
vase
yellow
and
spotted
like
the
skin
of
a
python
and
in
the
vase
was
a
group
of
orchids
those
grotesque
flowers
for
which
francesca
has
so
curious
a
predilection
i
felt
that
i
could
no
longer
bear
the
ordeal
i
looked
at
the
flowers
to
distract
my
thoughts
and
their
strange
distorted
shapes
carried
me
to
the
distant
countries
of
their
birth
giving
me
a
respite
from
my
haunting
grief
he
went
on
drawing
in
silence
his
eyes
passing
continually
from
the
paper
to
my
hand
two
or
three
times
he
looked
at
the
vase
at
last
rising
from
his
chair
he
said
excuse
me
and
lifting
the
vase
he
carried
it
away
and
placed
it
on
another
table
i
do
not
know
why
that
he
resumed
his
drawing
with
much
greater
freedom
as
if
relieved
of
an
annoyance
can
not
describe
the
sensation
produced
in
me
by
his
eyes
i
felt
as
if
not
my
hand
but
a
part
of
my
soul
were
laid
bare
to
his
scrutinising
gaze
that
his
eyes
pierced
to
its
very
depths
exploring
its
most
secret
recesses
never
had
my
hand
felt
so
alive
so
expressive
so
responsive
to
my
heart
revealing
so
much
that
i
would
fain
have
kept
secret
under
his
gaze
i
felt
it
quiver
imperceptibly
but
continuously
and
the
tremor
spread
to
my
innermost
veins
when
his
gaze
grew
too
intense
i
was
seized
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
withdraw
my
hand
altogether
arising
from
a
sense
of
shame
and
then
he
would
stop
drawing
and
sit
for
quite
an
appreciable
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
and
then
i
had
the
impression
that
he
was
absorbing
something
of
me
through
his
pupils
or
that
he
was
caressing
me
with
a
touch
that
was
softer
than
the
velvet
beneath
my
hand
at
other
times
while
he
bent
over
the
drawing
transferring
maybe
into
the
lines
what
he
had
taken
from
me
a
faint
smile
played
round
his
mouth
so
faint
that
i
only
just
caught
it
i
do
not
know
why
but
that
smile
sent
a
pang
of
delight
thrilling
through
my
heart
once
or
twice
i
saw
the
image
of
a
kiss
appear
again
upon
his
lips
last
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
and
i
said
well
what
is
it
was
at
the
piano
with
her
back
turned
to
us
her
fingers
wandering
over
the
keys
trying
to
remember
rameau
gavotte
the
yellow
that
i
have
played
so
often
and
which
will
always
be
connected
in
my
mind
with
my
stay
at
schifanoja
she
muffled
the
notes
with
the
soft
pedal
and
broke
off
frequently
these
interruptions
and
gaps
in
the
melody
which
was
so
familiar
to
me
and
which
my
ear
filled
up
each
time
in
advance
added
immeasurably
to
my
distress
all
at
once
she
struck
one
note
hard
several
times
in
succession
as
if
under
the
spur
of
some
nervous
irritation
then
she
started
up
and
came
and
bent
over
the
drawing
looked
at
her
i
understood
it
all
last
drop
was
wanting
in
my
cup
of
bitterness
god
had
still
this
last
and
cruelest
trial
of
all
reserved
for
his
will
be
done
i
have
now
but
one
thought
one
desire
to
fly
from
here
to
escape
have
come
to
the
end
of
my
strength
this
love
is
crushing
me
is
killing
me
and
the
unexpected
discovery
i
have
made
increases
my
wretchedness
a
what
are
her
feelings
towards
me
what
does
she
think
so
she
loves
him
too
and
since
when
does
he
know
it
or
has
he
no
suspicion
of
the
fact
dio
mio
dio
i
believe
i
am
going
out
of
my
mind
all
my
strength
of
will
is
forsaking
me
at
long
intervals
there
comes
a
pause
in
my
torment
as
when
the
wild
elements
of
the
tempest
hold
their
breath
for
a
moment
only
to
break
forth
again
with
redoubled
fury
i
sit
then
in
a
kind
of
stupor
with
heavy
head
and
my
limbs
feeling
as
bruised
and
tired
as
if
i
had
been
beaten
and
while
my
pain
gathers
itself
up
for
a
fresh
onslaught
i
do
not
succeed
in
collecting
sufficient
strength
to
resist
it
does
she
think
of
me
what
does
she
think
how
much
does
she
know
to
be
misjudged
by
her
my
best
my
dearest
friend
the
one
to
whom
i
have
always
been
able
to
open
my
heart
this
is
my
crowning
grief
my
bitterest
trial
must
speak
to
her
before
i
go
she
must
know
all
from
me
i
must
know
all
from
her
that
is
only
right
and
just
about
five
she
proposed
a
drive
along
the
rovigliano
road
we
two
went
alone
in
the
open
carriage
i
was
trembling
with
agitation
as
i
said
to
myself
here
is
my
opportunity
for
speaking
to
her
but
my
nervousness
deprived
me
of
every
vestige
of
courage
did
she
expect
me
to
confide
in
her
i
can
not
tell
sat
silent
for
a
long
while
listening
to
the
steady
trot
of
the
horses
looking
at
the
trees
and
the
meadows
by
the
side
of
the
road
from
time
to
time
by
a
brief
remark
or
a
sign
she
drew
my
attention
to
some
detail
of
the
autumnal
landscape
the
witchery
of
the
autumn
concentrated
itself
into
this
hour
the
slanting
rays
of
the
evening
sun
lit
up
the
rich
and
sombre
harmonies
of
the
dying
foliage
gold
amber
saffron
violet
purple
tints
the
most
faded
and
the
most
violent
mingled
in
one
deep
strain
not
to
be
surpassed
by
any
melody
of
spring
however
sweet
look
she
said
pointing
to
the
acacias
would
you
not
say
they
were
in
flower
last
after
an
interval
of
silence
to
make
a
beginning
i
said
manuel
is
sure
to
be
here
by
saturday
i
expect
a
telegram
from
him
and
we
shall
leave
by
the
early
train
on
sunday
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
while
i
have
been
with
you
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
you
voice
broke
a
flood
of
tenderness
swelled
my
heart
she
took
my
hand
and
clasped
it
tight
without
speaking
or
looking
at
me
we
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
holding
one
another
by
the
hand
she
asked
how
long
will
you
be
with
your
mother
till
the
end
of
the
year
i
hope
perhaps
longer
as
long
as
that
fell
silent
again
by
this
time
i
felt
i
should
never
have
the
courage
to
face
an
explanation
besides
which
i
felt
that
it
was
less
necessary
now
francesca
seemed
to
have
come
back
to
me
to
understand
me
to
be
once
more
the
sweet
kind
sister
of
old
my
sorrow
drew
out
her
sadness
as
the
moon
attracts
the
waters
of
the
ocean
listen
she
said
sound
of
women
voices
singing
floated
over
to
us
from
the
fields
a
slow
song
full
and
solemn
as
a
gregorian
chant
further
on
we
came
in
sight
of
the
singers
they
were
coming
away
from
a
field
of
dried
sunflowers
walking
in
single
file
like
a
religious
procession
and
the
sunflowers
on
their
long
leafless
stalks
their
great
discs
stripped
of
their
halo
of
petals
and
their
wealth
of
seed
were
like
liturgic
emblems
or
monstrances
of
pale
gold
emotion
waxed
greater
the
song
spread
wide
through
the
evening
air
we
passed
through
rovigliano
where
the
lamps
were
beginning
to
twinkle
and
came
out
again
upon
the
high
road
the
church
bells
rang
softly
behind
us
a
moist
breeze
rustled
in
the
trees
that
cast
a
faint
blue
shadow
on
the
white
road
and
in
the
air
a
shadow
as
liquid
as
water
are
you
not
cold
she
asked
me
and
she
ordered
the
footman
to
spread
a
rug
over
us
and
told
the
coachman
to
turn
homewards
the
belfry
at
rovigliano
a
bell
tolled
with
deep
slow
strokes
as
for
some
solemn
rite
and
the
wave
of
sound
seemed
to
send
a
wave
of
cold
through
the
air
with
a
simultaneous
movement
we
drew
closer
to
one
another
settling
the
rug
more
warmly
over
our
knees
and
a
shiver
ran
through
us
both
the
carriage
entered
the
town
at
a
walk
what
can
that
bell
be
ringing
for
she
murmured
in
a
voice
that
hardly
seemed
like
her
own
answered
i
fancy
it
must
be
for
the
viaticum
in
fact
a
little
further
on
we
saw
the
priest
just
entering
a
door
while
a
clerk
held
the
canopy
over
him
and
two
others
stood
upon
the
threshold
straight
as
candelabra
holding
up
lighted
lanterns
a
single
window
of
the
house
was
lighted
up
the
one
behind
which
the
dying
christian
was
awaiting
extreme
unction
faint
shadows
flitted
across
the
brightness
of
that
pale
yellow
square
on
which
was
outlined
the
whole
mysterious
drama
of
death
footman
bent
down
from
the
box
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
who
is
it
person
addressed
answered
in
dialect
and
mentioned
a
woman
name
would
have
liked
to
muffle
the
sound
of
the
carriage
wheels
upon
the
stones
to
have
made
our
passage
a
silent
one
past
the
spot
where
a
soul
was
about
to
take
flight
francesca
i
am
sure
shared
my
feeling
carriage
turned
into
the
road
to
schifanoja
and
the
horses
set
off
at
a
brisk
trot
the
moon
ringed
by
a
halo
shone
like
an
opal
in
the
sky
a
train
of
cloud
rose
out
of
the
sea
and
stretched
away
by
degrees
in
spiral
form
like
a
trail
of
smoke
the
somewhat
stormy
sea
drowned
all
other
sounds
with
its
roar
never
i
think
did
a
heavier
sadness
weigh
upon
two
spirits
felt
something
wet
upon
my
cold
cheek
and
turning
to
francesca
to
see
if
she
noticed
that
i
was
crying
i
met
her
eyes
they
were
full
of
tears
and
so
we
sat
side
by
side
with
mute
convulsively
closed
lips
clasping
one
another
hand
the
tears
rolling
silently
drop
by
drop
over
our
cheeks
both
knowing
that
they
were
for
him
we
neared
schifanoja
i
dried
my
eyes
and
she
did
the
same
each
striving
to
hide
her
own
weakness
was
standing
in
the
hall
with
delfina
and
muriella
looking
out
for
us
why
did
i
feel
a
sudden
vague
distrust
of
him
as
if
some
instinct
warned
me
of
hidden
danger
what
troubles
are
in
store
for
me
in
the
future
shall
i
be
able
to
escape
from
the
passion
that
attracts
and
blinds
me
yet
those
few
tears
have
given
me
much
relief
i
feel
less
broken
less
scorched
more
and
it
affords
me
an
indescribable
fond
pleasure
to
retrace
again
for
myself
alone
that
last
drive
while
delfina
sleeps
made
happy
by
the
storm
of
kisses
i
rained
upon
her
face
and
while
the
moon
that
so
lately
saw
me
weep
smiles
sadly
through
the
window
panes
did
i
sleep
last
night
did
i
wake
i
could
not
say
through
my
brain
like
thick
dark
shadows
flitted
terrifying
thoughts
insupportable
images
of
torment
and
my
heart
gave
sudden
throbs
and
bounds
and
i
would
find
myself
staring
into
the
darkness
not
knowing
whether
i
had
just
awakened
from
a
dream
or
whether
i
had
never
been
asleep
at
all
and
this
state
of
infinitely
more
unbearable
than
real
sleeplessness
continued
throughout
the
night
when
i
heard
my
little
girl
morning
call
i
did
not
answer
but
pretended
to
be
sound
asleep
so
that
i
need
not
rise
so
that
i
might
remain
a
few
minutes
longer
in
bed
and
thus
retard
for
a
while
the
inexorable
certainty
of
the
realities
of
life
the
torments
of
thought
and
imagination
seemed
to
me
less
cruel
than
those
so
impossible
to
foresee
which
awaited
me
in
these
last
two
days
little
while
later
delfina
came
in
on
holding
her
breath
she
looked
at
me
and
then
whispered
to
dorothy
with
a
little
fond
tremor
in
her
voice
she
is
fast
asleep
we
will
not
wake
her
i
do
not
believe
i
have
a
spark
of
life
left
in
me
as
i
came
upstairs
i
felt
at
each
step
as
if
every
drop
of
blood
had
left
my
veins
i
am
as
weak
as
one
at
the
point
of
death
courage
only
a
few
hours
more
manuel
will
be
here
morning
we
shall
leave
on
sunday
and
on
monday
i
shall
be
with
my
mother
now
i
returned
him
two
or
three
books
he
had
lent
me
in
the
volume
of
shelley
i
underlined
with
my
nail
the
last
two
lines
of
a
certain
verse
and
put
a
mark
in
the
page
and
forget
me
for
i
be
thine
night
all
day
long
he
has
sought
an
opportunity
for
speaking
to
me
his
distress
is
evident
and
all
day
long
i
have
done
my
utmost
to
avoid
him
so
that
he
might
not
sow
fresh
seeds
of
pain
of
desire
of
regret
and
remorse
in
my
heart
and
i
have
triumphed
i
was
strong
and
brave
my
god
i
thank
thee
night
is
the
last
we
leave
all
will
be
over
will
be
over
a
voice
out
of
the
depths
cries
unto
me
i
do
not
understand
its
words
but
i
know
that
it
tells
me
of
coming
disaster
unknown
but
inevitable
mysterious
and
inexorable
as
death
the
future
is
lugubrious
as
a
cemetery
full
of
open
graves
ready
to
receive
the
dead
with
here
and
there
a
flicker
of
pale
torches
which
i
can
scarce
distinguish
and
i
know
not
if
they
are
there
to
lure
me
on
to
destruction
or
to
show
me
to
a
path
of
safety
have
my
journal
slowly
carefully
from
the
of
september
the
day
of
my
arrival
what
a
difference
between
the
first
entry
and
the
last
wrote
i
shall
wake
up
in
the
house
of
a
friend
to
the
enjoyment
of
francesca
cordial
hospitality
in
schifanoja
where
the
roses
are
so
fair
and
the
cypresses
so
tall
and
grand
i
shall
wake
with
the
prospect
of
some
weeks
of
peace
before
me
twenty
days
or
more
of
congenial
intellectual
companionship
alas
where
is
that
promised
peace
but
the
roses
the
beautiful
roses
were
they
too
faithless
to
their
promise
did
i
perhaps
on
that
first
night
in
the
loggia
open
my
heart
too
wide
to
their
seductive
fragrance
while
delfina
slept
and
now
the
october
moon
floods
the
sky
with
its
cold
radiance
and
through
the
closed
windows
i
see
the
sharp
points
of
the
cypresses
all
sombre
and
motionless
and
on
that
night
they
seemed
to
touch
the
stars
that
prelude
there
is
but
one
phrase
which
finds
a
place
in
this
sad
finale
so
many
hairs
on
my
head
so
many
thorns
in
my
woeful
destiny
am
going
and
what
will
he
do
when
i
am
far
away
what
will
francesca
do
change
in
francesca
still
remains
incomprehensible
inexplicable
an
enigma
that
torments
and
bewilders
me
she
loves
him
but
since
when
and
does
he
know
it
confess
oh
my
soul
to
this
fresh
misery
a
new
poison
is
added
to
that
already
infecting
me
i
am
jealous
i
am
prepared
for
any
suffering
even
the
most
horrible
i
know
well
the
martyrdom
that
awaits
me
i
know
that
the
anguish
of
these
days
is
as
nought
compared
to
that
which
i
must
face
presently
the
terrible
cross
on
which
my
soul
must
hang
i
am
ready
all
i
ask
oh
my
god
is
a
respite
a
short
respite
for
the
hours
that
remain
to
me
here
i
shall
have
need
of
all
my
strength
strangely
sometimes
the
incidents
of
one
life
repeat
themselves
this
evening
in
the
i
seemed
to
have
gone
back
to
the
of
september
when
i
first
played
and
sang
and
my
thoughts
began
to
occupy
themselves
with
him
this
evening
again
i
was
seated
at
the
piano
and
the
same
subdued
light
illumined
the
room
and
next
door
manuel
and
the
marchese
were
at
the
i
played
the
gavotte
the
yellow
of
which
francesca
is
so
fond
and
which
i
heard
some
one
trying
to
play
on
the
of
september
while
i
sat
up
in
my
room
and
began
my
nightly
vigils
of
unrest
i
am
sure
is
not
asleep
when
i
came
upstairs
he
went
in
and
took
the
marchese
place
opposite
to
my
husband
are
they
playing
still
doubtless
he
is
thinking
and
his
heart
aches
while
he
plays
what
are
his
thoughts
what
are
his
sufferings
can
not
sleep
i
shall
go
out
into
the
loggia
i
want
to
see
if
they
are
still
playing
or
if
he
has
gone
to
his
room
his
windows
are
at
the
corner
in
the
second
story
is
a
clear
mild
night
there
are
lights
still
in
the
i
stayed
a
long
time
in
the
loggia
looking
down
at
the
light
shining
out
against
the
cypresses
and
mingling
with
the
silvery
whiteness
of
the
moon
i
am
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
can
not
describe
the
almost
tragic
effect
of
those
lighted
windows
behind
which
the
two
men
are
playing
opposite
to
one
another
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
scarcely
broken
by
the
dull
sob
of
the
sea
and
they
will
perhaps
play
on
till
morning
if
he
will
pander
so
far
to
my
husband
terrible
failing
so
we
shall
all
three
wake
till
the
dawn
and
take
no
rest
each
a
prey
to
his
own
passion
what
is
he
really
thinking
of
of
what
nature
is
his
pain
what
would
i
not
give
at
this
moment
to
see
him
to
be
able
to
gaze
at
him
till
the
day
breaks
even
if
it
were
only
through
the
window
in
the
night
dews
trembling
as
i
do
now
from
head
to
foot
the
maddest
wildest
thoughts
rush
through
my
brain
like
flashes
of
lightning
dazzling
and
confusing
me
i
feel
the
prompting
of
some
evil
spirit
to
do
some
rash
and
irreparable
thing
i
feel
as
if
i
were
treading
on
the
edge
of
perdition
it
would
i
feel
lift
the
great
weight
from
my
heart
would
take
this
suffocating
knot
from
my
throat
if
at
this
moment
i
could
cry
aloud
into
the
silence
of
the
night
with
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him

chapter
i
two
or
three
days
after
the
departure
of
the
ferrès
sperelli
and
his
cousins
returned
to
rome
donna
francesca
contrary
to
her
custom
wishing
to
shorten
her
stay
at
schifanoja
after
a
brief
stay
at
naples
andrea
reached
rome
on
the
of
october
a
sunday
in
the
first
heavy
morning
rain
of
the
autumn
season
he
experienced
an
extraordinary
pleasure
in
returning
to
his
apartments
in
the
casa
zuccari
his
tasteful
and
charming
there
he
seemed
to
find
again
some
portion
of
himself
something
he
had
missed
nothing
was
altered
everything
about
him
retained
in
his
eyes
that
indescribable
look
of
life
which
material
objects
assume
amongst
which
one
has
lived
and
loved
and
suffered
his
old
servants
jenny
and
terenzio
had
taken
the
utmost
care
of
everything
and
stephen
had
attended
to
every
detail
likely
to
conduce
to
his
master
comfort
it
was
raining
andrea
went
to
the
window
and
stood
for
some
time
looking
out
upon
his
beloved
rome
the
piazza
of
the
trinità
de
monti
was
solitary
and
deserted
left
to
the
guardianship
of
its
obelisk
the
trees
along
the
wall
that
joins
the
church
to
the
villa
medici
already
half
stripped
of
their
leaves
rustled
mournfully
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
the
pincio
alone
still
shone
green
like
an
island
in
a
lake
of
mist
and
as
he
gazed
one
sentiment
dominated
all
the
others
in
his
heart
the
sudden
and
lively
of
his
old
love
for
rome
fairest
rome
that
city
of
cities
immense
imperial
unique
like
the
sea
for
ever
young
for
ever
new
for
ever
mysterious
time
is
it
andrea
asked
of
stephen
it
was
about
nine
feeling
somewhat
tired
he
determined
to
have
a
sleep
also
that
he
would
see
no
one
that
day
and
spend
the
evening
quietly
at
home
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
the
life
of
the
great
world
of
rome
he
wished
before
taking
up
the
old
round
of
activity
to
indulge
in
a
little
meditation
a
slight
preparation
to
lay
down
certain
rules
to
discuss
with
himself
his
future
line
of
conduct
any
one
calls
he
said
to
stephen
that
i
have
not
yet
returned
and
let
the
porter
know
it
too
tell
james
i
shall
not
want
him
but
he
can
come
round
for
orders
this
evening
bring
me
lunch
at
three
something
very
light
and
dinner
at
nine
that
is
all
he
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
the
servant
woke
him
at
two
and
informed
him
that
just
before
twelve
the
duke
of
grimiti
had
called
having
heard
from
the
marchesa
that
he
had
returned
to
town
signor
duca
left
word
that
he
would
call
again
in
the
afternoon
it
still
raining
open
the
shutters
wide
the
rain
had
stopped
the
sky
was
lighter
a
band
of
pale
sunshine
streamed
into
the
room
and
spread
over
the
tapestry
representing
virgin
with
the
holy
child
and
stefano
a
work
of
art
brought
by
giusto
sperelli
from
flanders
in
andrea
eyes
wandered
slowly
over
the
walls
rejoicing
in
the
beautiful
hangings
the
harmonious
tints
and
all
these
things
so
familiar
and
so
dear
to
him
seemed
to
offer
him
a
welcome
the
sight
of
them
afforded
him
intense
pleasure
and
then
the
image
of
maria
ferrès
rose
up
before
him
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
the
pillows
lit
a
cigarette
and
abandoned
himself
luxuriously
to
his
meditations
an
unwonted
sense
of
comfort
and
filled
his
body
while
his
mind
was
in
its
happiest
vein
his
thoughts
mingled
with
the
rings
of
smoke
in
the
subdued
light
in
which
all
forms
and
colours
assume
a
pleasing
vagueness
instead
of
reverting
to
the
days
that
were
past
his
thoughts
carried
him
forward
into
the
he
would
see
donna
maria
again
in
two
or
three
months
perhaps
much
sooner
there
was
no
saying
then
he
would
resume
the
broken
thread
of
that
love
which
held
for
him
so
many
obscure
promises
so
many
secret
attractions
to
a
man
of
culture
donna
maria
ferrès
was
the
ideal
woman
baudelaire
avec
des
the
perfect
the
friend
who
can
hold
out
both
comfort
and
pardon
though
she
had
marked
those
sorrowful
lines
in
the
volume
of
shelley
she
had
most
assuredly
said
very
different
words
in
her
heart
can
never
be
thine
why
ah
there
had
been
too
much
passionate
intensity
for
that
in
the
voice
in
which
she
answered
him
that
day
in
the
wood
at
vicomile
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
he
could
hear
her
voice
now
that
voice
stephen
knocked
at
the
door
i
remind
the
signor
conte
that
it
is
three
andrea
rose
and
passed
into
the
octagonal
room
to
dress
the
sun
shone
through
the
lace
window
screens
and
sparkled
on
the
tiles
the
innumerable
toilet
articles
of
crystal
and
silver
the
on
the
antique
sarcophagus
its
dancing
reflections
imparting
a
delightful
sense
of
movement
to
the
air
he
felt
in
the
best
of
spirits
completely
cured
full
of
the
joy
and
the
vivacity
of
life
he
was
inexpressibly
happy
to
be
back
in
his
home
once
more
all
that
was
most
frivolous
most
capricious
most
worldly
in
him
awoke
with
a
bound
it
was
as
if
the
surrounding
objects
had
the
power
to
evoke
in
him
the
man
of
former
days
his
sensual
curiosity
his
elasticity
his
ubiquity
of
mind
reappeared
he
already
began
to
feel
the
necessity
of
expansion
of
mixing
in
the
world
of
pleasure
and
with
his
friends
he
discovered
that
he
was
very
hungry
and
ordered
the
servant
to
bring
the
lunch
at
once
he
rarely
dined
at
home
but
for
special
occasions
some
lunch
or
private
little
supper
he
had
a
decorated
with
eighteenth
century
neapolitan
tapestries
which
carlo
sperelli
had
ordered
of
pietro
dinanti
in
from
designs
by
storace
the
seven
wall
panels
represented
episodes
of
bacchic
love
the
portières
and
the
draperies
above
the
doors
and
windows
having
groups
of
fruit
and
flowers
shades
of
gold
pale
or
tawny
predominated
and
mingling
with
the
warm
pearly
and
sombre
blues
formed
a
harmony
of
colour
that
was
both
delicate
and
sumptuous
the
duke
of
grimiti
comes
back
show
him
up
he
said
to
the
servant
into
this
room
too
the
sun
sinking
towards
the
monte
mario
shot
his
dazzling
rays
you
could
hear
the
rumble
of
the
carriages
in
the
piazza
of
the
trinità
de
monti
the
rain
over
it
looked
as
if
all
the
luminous
gold
of
the
roman
october
were
spread
out
over
the
city
the
window
he
said
to
the
servant
the
noise
of
the
carriage
wheels
was
louder
now
a
soft
damp
breeze
stirred
the
curtains
lightly
rome
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
the
sky
between
the
wide
curtains
an
irresistible
curiosity
drew
him
to
the
open
window
rome
appeared
all
pearly
gray
spread
out
before
him
its
lines
a
little
blurred
like
a
faded
picture
under
a
claude
lorrain
sky
sprinkled
with
ethereal
clouds
their
noble
grouping
lending
to
the
clear
spaces
between
an
indescribable
delicacy
as
flowers
lend
a
new
grace
to
the
verdure
which
surrounds
them
on
the
distant
heights
the
gray
deepened
gradually
to
amethyst
long
trailing
vapours
slid
through
the
cypresses
of
the
monte
mario
like
waving
locks
through
a
comb
of
bronze
close
by
the
pines
of
the
monte
pincio
spread
their
canopies
below
on
the
piazza
the
obelisk
of
pius
vi
looked
like
a
pillar
of
agate
under
this
rich
autumnal
light
everything
took
on
a
sumptuous
air
divine
rome
he
feasted
his
eyes
on
the
prospect
before
him
looking
down
he
saw
a
group
of
clerics
pass
along
by
the
church
then
the
black
coach
of
a
prelate
with
its
two
black
horses
then
other
open
carriages
containing
ladies
and
children
he
recognised
the
princess
of
ferentino
with
barbarella
viti
followed
by
the
countess
of
lucoli
driving
a
pair
of
ponies
and
accompanied
by
her
great
danish
hound
a
perturbing
breath
of
the
old
life
passed
over
his
spirit
awakening
indeterminate
desires
in
his
heart
he
left
the
window
and
returned
to
his
lunch
the
sun
shone
on
the
wall
and
lit
up
a
dance
of
satyrs
round
a
silenus
duke
of
grimiti
and

other
gentlemen
announced

duke
entered
with
ludovico
barbarisi
and
giulio
musellaro
andrea
hastened
forward
to
meet
them
and
they
greeted
him
warmly
giulio
exclaimed
sperelli
who
had
not
seen
his
friend
for
more
than
two
years
how
long
have
you
been
in
rome
a
week
i
was
going
to
write
to
you
to
schifanoja
but
thought
i
would
rather
wait
till
you
came
back
and
how
are
you
you
are
looking
a
little
thin
but
very
well
it
was
only
when
i
got
back
to
rome
that
i
heard
of
your
affair
otherwise
i
would
certainly
have
come
from
india
to
offer
you
my
services
at
the
beginning
of
may
i
was
at
padmavati
in
the
bahara
what
a
heap
of
things
i
have
to
tell
you
so
have
i
they
shook
hands
heartily
a
second
time
sperelli
seemed
overjoyed
none
of
his
friends
were
so
dear
to
him
as
musellaro
for
his
noble
character
his
keen
and
penetrating
mind
and
rare
culture
ludovico
sit
down
giulio
will
you
sit
here
he
offered
them
tea
cigarettes
liqueurs
the
conversation
grew
very
lively
grimiti
and
barbarisi
gave
the
news
of
rome
especially
the
more
spicy
items
of
society
gossip
the
aroma
of
the
tea
mingled
with
that
of
the
tobacco
have
brought
you
a
chest
of
tea
said
musellaro
to
sperelli
much
better
tea
too
than
your
famous
kien
loung
used
to
drink
do
you
remember
in
london
how
he
used
to
make
tea
after
the
poetical
method
of
the
great
emperor

is
as
lovely

her
passion
for

landbrooke

instantly

be
very
pleased

she
still
dress
in
green
and
wear
sunflowers
in
her
hat
no
she
has
apparently
abandoned
the
æsthetic
for
good
and
all
she
goes
in
for
feathers
now
on
sunday
she
was
wearing
an
enormous
hat
à
la
montpensier
with
a
perfectly
fabulous
feather

gino
bomminaco
begs

remembered
to
you
added
barbarisi
ha
exclaimed
the
duke
with
a
burst
of
laughter
should
get
gino
to
tell
you
the
story
of
his
adventure
with
donna
giulia
moceto
you
are
i
fancy
in
a
position
to
give
us
some
details
on
the
subject
of
donna
giulia
ludovico
too
began
to
laugh
i
know
broke
in
musellaro
have
made
the
most
tremendous
conquests
in
rome
tell
me
do
tell
me
about
this
adventure
asked
andrea
with
impatient
curiosity
these
subjects
excited
him
encouraged
by
his
friends
he
launched
forth
into
a
discourse
on
female
beauty
displaying
the
profound
knowledge
and
fervour
of
a
connoisseur
taking
a
pleasure
in
using
the
most
expressions
with
the
subtle
distinctions
of
an
artist
and
a
libertine
indeed
had
any
one
taken
the
trouble
to
write
down
the
conversation
of
the
four
young
men
within
these
walls
hung
with
the
voluptuous
scenes
of
the
bacchic
tapestries
it
might
well
have
formed
the
of
corruption
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
shades
of
evening
were
falling
but
the
air
was
still
permeated
with
light
as
a
sponge
absorbs
the
water
through
the
windows
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
horizon
and
a
band
of
orange
against
which
the
cypresses
of
the
monte
mario
stood
out
sharply
like
the
teeth
of
a
great
ebony
rake
ever
and
anon
came
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
assembling
in
groups
on
the
roof
of
the
villa
medici
before
descending
on
the
villa
borghese
and
into
the
narrow
valley
of
sleep
are
you
going
to
do
this
evening
barbarisi
asked
andrea
really
do
know
then
come
with
us
dinner
at
eight
at
doney
to
inaugurate
his
new
restaurant
at
the
teatro
nazionale

with
us
entreated
giulio
musellaro
the
three
of
us
continued
the
duke
will
be
giulia
arici
bébé
silva
and
maria
fortuna
that
reminds
me
capital
idea
you
bring
clara
green
capital
idea
echoed
ludovico
barbarisi
where
shall
i
find
clara
green
the
hotel
de
close
by
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
a
note
from
you
would
put
her
in
the
seventh
heaven
she
is
certain
to
give
up
any
other
engagement
she
may
have
andrea
was
quite
agreeable
to
the
plan
it
would
be
better
if
i
called
on
her
he
said
is
pretty
sure
to
be
in
now
do
you
think
so
ruggiero
dress
quick
and
come
out
with
us
now
clara
green
had
just
come
in
she
received
andrea
with
childish
delight
no
doubt
she
would
have
preferred
to
dine
alone
with
him
but
she
accepted
the
invitation
without
hesitating
wrote
a
note
to
excuse
herself
from
a
previous
engagement
and
sent
the
key
of
her
box
at
the
theatre
to
a
lady
friend
she
seemed
overjoyed
she
told
him
a
string
of
sentimental
stories
and
vowed
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
forget
him
holding
andrea
hands
in
hers
while
she
talked
i
love
you
more
than
words
can
say
andrew
she
was
still
young
with
her
pure
and
regular
profile
her
pale
gold
hair
parted
and
knotted
very
low
on
her
neck
she
looked
like
a
beauty
in
a
keepsake
a
certain
affectation
of
æstheticism
clung
to
her
since
her
liaison
with
the
adolphus
jeckyll
a
disciple
in
poetry
of
keats
in
painting
of
holman
hunt
a
composer
of
obscure
sonnets
a
painter
of
subjects
from
the
she
had
sat
to
him
for
a
and
a
with
the
she
had
also
sat
to
andrea
for
a
study
of
the
head
of
isabella
in
boccaccio
story
art
therefore
had
conferred
upon
her
the
stamp
of
nobility
but
at
bottom
she
possessed
no
spiritual
qualities
whatsoever
she
even
became
tiresome
in
the
by
reason
of
that
sentimental
romanticism
so
often
affected
by
english
which
contrasts
so
strangely
with
the
depravity
of
their
licentiousness
would
have
thought
that
we
should
ever
be
together
again
andrew
an
hour
later
andrea
left
her
and
returned
to
the
palazzo
zuccari
by
the
little
flight
of
steps
leading
from
the
piazza
mignanelli
to
the
trinità
the
murmur
of
the
city
floated
up
the
solitary
little
stairway
through
the
mild
air
of
the
october
evening
the
stars
twinkled
in
a
cool
pure
sky
down
below
at
the
palazzo
casteldelfina
the
shrubs
inside
the
little
gate
cast
vague
uncertain
shadows
in
the
mysterious
light
like
marine
plants
waving
at
the
bottom
of
an
aquarium
from
the
palace
through
a
lighted
window
with
red
curtains
came
the
tinkle
of
a
piano
the
church
bells
were
ringing
andrea
felt
his
heart
suddenly
grow
heavy
the
recollection
of
donna
maria
came
back
to
him
with
a
rush
filling
him
with
a
dim
sense
of
regret
almost
of
remorse
what
was
she
doing
at
this
moment
thinking
suffering
deep
sadness
fell
upon
him
he
felt
as
if
something
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
had
taken
flight
he
could
not
define
what
it
was
but
it
affected
him
as
some
irreparable
loss
he
thought
of
his
plan
of
the
morning
an
evening
of
solitude
in
the
rooms
to
which
some
day
perhaps
she
might
come
an
evening
sad
yet
sweet
in
company
with
remembrances
and
dreams
in
company
with
her
spirit
an
evening
of
meditation
and
in
truth
he
had
kept
well
to
his
promises
he
was
on
his
way
to
a
dinner
with
friends
and
and
doubtless
would
go
home
with
clara
green
afterwards
his
regret
was
so
poignant
so
intolerable
that
he
dressed
with
unwonted
rapidity
jumped
into
his
brougham
and
arrived
at
the
hotel
before
the
appointed
time
he
found
clara
ready
and
waiting
and
offered
her
a
drive
round
the
streets
of
rome
to
pass
the
time
till
eight
they
drove
through
the
via
del
babuino
round
the
obelisk
in
the
piazza
del
popolo
along
the
corso
and
to
the
right
down
the
via
della
fontanella
di
borghese
returning
by
the
montecitorio
to
the
corso
which
they
followed
as
far
as
the
piazza
di
venezia
and
so
to
the
teatro
nazionale
clara
kept
up
an
incessant
chatter
bending
every
other
minute
towards
her
companion
to
press
a
kiss
on
the
corner
of
his
mouth
screening
the
furtive
caress
behind
a
fan
of
white
feathers
which
gave
out
a
delicate
odour
of
rose
but
andrea
appeared
not
to
hear
her
and
even
her
caress
only
drew
from
him
a
slight
smile
pensi
she
asked
pronouncing
the
italian
words
with
a
certain
hesitation
which
was
very
taking
returned
andrea
taking
up
one
of
her
ungloved
hands
and
examining
the
rings
lo
sa
she
sighed
throwing
a
vast
amount
of
expression
into
these
three
words
which
foreign
women
pick
up
at
once
because
they
imagine
that
they
contain
all
the
pensive
melancholy
of
italian
love
lo
sa
with
a
sudden
change
of
humour
andrea
kissed
her
on
the
ear
slipped
an
arm
round
her
waist
and
proceeded
to
say
a
host
of
foolish
things
to
her
the
corso
was
very
lively
the
shop
windows
resplendent
yelled
public
and
private
vehicles
crossed
the
path
of
their
carriage
all
the
stir
and
animation
of
roman
evening
life
was
in
full
swing
from
the
piazza
colonna
to
the
piazza
di
venezia
it
was
ten
minutes
past
eight
by
the
time
they
reached
doney
the
other
guests
were
already
there
andrea
sperelli
greeted
the
assembled
company
and
taking
clara
green
by
the
hand
he
said
miss
clara
green
domini
sibylla
palmifera
candida
pro
nobis
replied
musellaro
barbarisi
and
grimiti
in
chorus
the
women
laughed
though
they
did
not
understand
clara
smiled
and
slipping
out
of
her
cloak
appeared
in
a
white
dress
quite
simple
and
short
with
a
opening
back
and
front
a
knot
of
ribbon
on
her
left
shoulder
and
emeralds
in
her
ears
perfectly
unabashed
by
the
triple
scrutiny
of
giulia
arici
bébé
silva
and
maria
fortuna
musellaro
and
grimiti
were
old
acquaintances
barbarisi
was
introduced
andrea
proceeded
silva
surnamed
bébé
pero
fortuna
a
veritable
for
our
rome
which
has
the
good
fortune
to
possess
her
then
turning
to
barbarisi
us
the
honour
to
present
us
to
this
lady
who
is
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
divine
giulia
farnese
arici
giulia
broke
in
i
beg
your
pardon
but
really
to
believe
that
i
should
have
to
call
upon
all
my
powers
of
credulity
and
to
consult
pinturicchio
in
the
fifth
room
he
uttered
these
absurdities
with
a
grave
smile
amusing
himself
by
bewildering
and
teasing
these
pretty
fools
in
the
he
adopted
a
manner
and
style
entirely
his
own
using
grotesque
phrases
launching
the
most
ridiculous
paradoxes
or
atrocious
impertinences
under
cover
of
the
ambiguity
of
his
words
and
all
this
in
most
original
language
rich
in
a
thousand
different
flavours
like
a
rabelaisian
full
of
strong
spices
and
succulent
morsels
asked
giulia
turning
to
barbarisi
that
exclaimed
andrea
a
sort
of
feeble
who
once
took
it
into
his
head
to
paint
your
picture
on
a
door
in
the
pope
apartments
never
mind
him
he
is
dead
how
a
most
appalling
manner
his
wife
lover
was
a
soldier
from
perugia
in
garrison
at
sienna
ask
ludovico
he
knows
all
about
it
but
has
never
liked
to
tell
you
for
fear
of
hurting
your
feelings
allow
me
to
inform
you
bébé
that
the
prince
of
wales
does
not
begin
to
smoke
till
between
the
second
and
third
courses
never
sooner
you
are
anticipating
bébé
silva
had
lighted
a
cigarette
and
was
eating
oysters
while
she
let
the
smoke
curl
through
her
nostrils
she
was
like
a
restless
schoolboy
a
little
depraved
hermaphrodite
pale
and
thin
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
heightened
by
fever
and
kohl
with
lips
that
were
too
red
and
short
and
rather
woolly
hair
that
covered
her
head
like
an
astrachan
cap
fixed
tightly
in
her
left
eye
was
a
single
she
wore
a
high
stiff
collar
a
white
necktie
an
open
waistcoat
a
little
black
coat
of
masculine
cut
and
a
gardenia
in
her
she
affected
the
manners
of
a
dandy
and
spoke
in
a
deep
husky
voice
and
just
therein
lay
the
secret
of
her
attraction
in
this
imprint
of
vice
of
depravity
of
abnormity
in
her
appearance
her
attitudes
and
her
words
y
maria
fortuna
on
the
contrary
was
of
somewhat
bovine
type
a
madame
de
parabère
with
a
tendency
to
stoutness
like
the
fair
mistress
of
the
regent
she
possessed
a
very
white
skin
one
of
those
opaque
white
complexions
which
seem
only
to
flourish
and
improve
on
sensual
pleasure
her
liquid
violet
eyes
swam
in
a
faint
blue
shadow
and
her
lips
always
a
little
parted
disclosed
a
vague
gleam
of
pearl
behind
their
soft
rosy
line
like
a
shell
giulia
arici
took
andrea
fancy
very
much
on
account
of
her
tints
and
her
great
velvety
eyes
of
that
soft
deep
chestnut
that
sometimes
shows
tawny
gleams
the
somewhat
fleshy
nose
and
the
full
dewy
scarlet
very
firm
lips
gave
the
lower
part
of
her
face
a
frankly
animal
look
her
which
were
too
prominent
raised
her
upper
lip
a
little
and
she
continually
ran
the
point
of
her
tongue
along
the
edge
to
moisten
it
like
the
thick
petal
of
a
rose
running
over
a
row
of
little
white
almonds
said
andrea
with
his
eyes
on
her
mouth
bernard
uses
in
one
of
his
sermons
an
epithet
which
would
suit
you
marvellously
and
i
be
bound
you
do
know
this
either
giulia
laughed
her
sonorous
rather
vacant
laugh
exhaling
in
the
excitement
of
her
hilarity
a
more
poignant
perfume
like
a
scented
shrub
when
it
is
shaken
will
you
give
me
continued
andrea
i
extract
from
the
holy
sermon
a
voluptuous
motto
to
fit
you
do
know
she
replied
laughing
holding
a
glass
of
chablis
in
her
long
slender
fingers
you
like
substantive
of
the
adjective
will
come
back
to
that
presently
the
word
is
messer
ludovico
you
can
add
this
clause
to
your
litanies
linguatica
glube
a
pity
said
musellaro
you
are
not
at
the
table
of
a
prince
sitting
between
a
violante
and
an
imperia
with
pietro

chapter
ii
the
year
was
dying
gracefully
a
late
wintry
sun
filled
the
sky
over
rome
with
a
soft
mild
golden
light
that
made
the
air
feel
almost
the
streets
were
full
as
on
a
sunday
in
may
a
stream
of
carriages
passed
and
repassed
rapidly
through
the
piazza
barberini
and
the
piazza
di
spagna
and
from
thence
a
vague
and
continuous
rumble
mounted
to
the
trinità
de
monti
and
the
via
sistina
and
even
faintly
reached
the
apartments
of
the
palazzo
zuccari
the
rooms
began
slowly
to
fill
with
the
scent
exhaled
from
numberless
vases
of
flowers
roses
hung
their
heavy
heads
over
crystal
vases
that
opened
like
diamond
lilies
on
a
golden
stem
similar
to
those
standing
behind
the
virgin
in
the
of
botticelli
in
the
borghese
gallery
no
other
shape
of
vase
is
to
be
compared
with
this
for
elegance
in
that
diaphanous
prison
the
flowers
seemed
to
etherealise
and
had
more
the
air
of
a
religious
than
an
amatory
offering
for
andrea
sperelli
was
expecting
elena
muti
he
had
met
her
only
yesterday
morning
in
the
via
condotti
where
she
was
looking
at
the
shops
she
had
returned
to
rome
a
day
or
two
before
after
her
long
and
mysterious
absence
they
had
both
been
considerably
agitated
by
the
unexpected
encounter
but
the
publicity
of
the
street
compelled
them
to
treat
one
another
with
ceremonious
almost
cold
politeness
however
he
had
said
with
a
grave
air
looking
her
full
in
the
eyes
have
much
to
say
to
you
elena
will
you
come
to
my
rooms
everything
is
just
as
it
used
to
be
nothing
is
changed
to
which
she
replied
quite
simply
well
i
will
come
you
may
expect
me
about
four
i
too
have
something
to
say
to
you
but
leave
me
now
that
she
should
have
accepted
the
invitation
so
promptly
without
demur
without
imposing
any
conditions
or
seemingly
attaching
the
smallest
importance
to
the
matter
roused
a
certain
vague
suspicion
in
mind
was
she
coming
as
friend
or
lover
to
renew
old
ties
or
to
destroy
all
hope
of
such
a
thing
for
ever
what
vicissitudes
had
not
occurred
in
this
woman
soul
during
the
last
two
years
of
that
he
was
necessarily
ignorant
but
he
had
carried
away
with
him
the
thrill
of
emotion
called
up
in
him
by
elena
glance
when
they
suddenly
met
in
the
street
and
he
bent
his
head
in
greeting
before
her
it
was
the
same
look
as
of
old
so
tender
so
deep
so
infinitely
seductive
from
under
the
long
lashes
everything
in
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
showed
evidences
of
special
loving
care
logs
of
juniper
wood
burned
brightly
on
the
hearth
the
little
stood
ready
with
its
cups
and
saucers
of
majolica
of
antique
shape
and
inimitable
grace
whereon
were
depicted
mythological
subjects
by
luzio
dolci
with
lines
from
ovid
underneath
in
black
characters
and
a
running
hand
the
light
from
the
windows
was
tempered
by
heavy
curtains
of
red
brocade
embroidered
all
over
with
silver
pomegranates
trailing
leaves
and
mottos
the
declining
sun
as
it
caught
the
cast
the
shadow
of
the
lace
blinds
on
the
carpet
the
clock
of
the
trinità
struck
three
he
had
half
an
hour
still
to
wait
andrea
rose
from
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
lying
and
opened
one
of
the
windows
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
room
took
up
a
book
read
a
few
lines
and
threw
it
down
again
looked
about
him
undecidedly
as
if
searching
for
something
the
suspense
was
so
trying
that
he
felt
the
necessity
of
rousing
himself
of
counteracting
his
mental
disquietude
by
physical
means
he
went
over
to
the
fireplace
stirred
up
the
logs
and
put
on
a
fresh
one
the
glowing
mass
collapsed
sending
up
a
shower
of
sparks
and
part
of
it
rolled
out
as
far
as
the
fender
the
flames
broke
into
a
quantity
of
little
tongues
of
blue
fire
springing
up
and
disappearing
fitfully
while
the
broken
ends
of
the
log
smoked
the
sight
brought
back
certain
memories
to
him
in
days
gone
by
elena
had
been
fond
of
lingering
over
this
fireside
she
expended
much
art
and
ingenuity
in
piling
the
wood
high
on
the
grasping
the
heavy
tongs
in
both
hands
and
leaning
her
head
slightly
back
to
avoid
the
sparks
her
hands
were
small
and
very
supple
with
that
flexibility
so
to
speak
of
a
daphne
at
the
very
first
onset
of
the
fabled
metamorphose
scarcely
were
these
matters
arranged
to
her
satisfaction
than
the
logs
would
catch
and
send
forth
a
sudden
blaze
and
the
warm
ruddy
light
would
struggle
for
a
moment
with
the
icy
gray
shades
of
evening
filtering
through
the
windows
the
sharp
fumes
of
the
burning
wood
seemed
to
rise
to
her
head
and
facing
the
glowing
mass
elena
would
be
seized
with
fits
of
childish
glee
she
had
a
rather
cruel
habit
of
pulling
all
the
flowers
to
pieces
and
scattering
them
over
the
carpet
at
the
end
of
each
of
her
visits
and
then
stand
ready
to
go
fastening
a
glove
or
a
bracelet
and
smile
in
the
midst
of
the
devastation
she
had
wrought
nothing
was
changed
since
then
a
host
of
memories
were
associated
with
these
things
which
elena
had
touched
on
which
her
eyes
had
rested
and
scenes
of
that
time
rose
up
vividly
and
tumultuously
before
him
after
nearly
two
years
absence
elena
was
going
to
cross
his
threshold
once
more
in
half
an
hour
she
would
be
seated
in
that
chair
a
little
out
of
breath
at
first
as
of
yore
would
have
removed
her
veil
be
speaking
all
these
familiar
objects
would
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
again
perhaps
even
her
laugh
after
two
long
years
shall
i
receive
her
what
shall
i
say
he
was
quite
sincere
in
his
anxiety
and
nervousness
for
he
had
really
begun
to
love
this
woman
once
more
but
the
expression
of
his
sentiments
whether
verbal
or
otherwise
was
ever
with
him
such
an
artificial
matter
so
far
removed
from
truth
and
simplicity
that
he
had
recourse
to
these
preparations
from
pure
habit
even
when
as
was
the
case
now
he
was
sincerely
and
deeply
moved
he
tried
to
imagine
the
scene
beforehand
to
compose
some
phrases
he
looked
about
him
in
the
room
considering
where
would
be
the
most
appropriate
spot
for
the
interview
then
he
went
over
to
a
to
see
if
his
face
were
as
pale
as
befitted
the
occasion
and
his
gaze
rested
complacently
on
his
forehead
just
where
the
hair
began
at
the
temples
and
where
in
the
old
days
elena
was
often
wont
to
press
a
delicate
kiss
in
matters
of
love
his
vitiated
and
effeminate
vanity
seized
upon
every
advantage
of
personal
grace
or
of
dress
to
heighten
the
charm
of
his
appearance
and
he
knew
how
to
extract
the
greatest
amount
of
pleasure
therefrom
the
chief
reason
of
his
unfailing
success
lay
in
the
fact
that
in
the
game
of
love
he
shrank
from
no
artifice
no
duplicity
no
falsehood
that
might
further
his
cause
a
great
portion
of
his
strength
lay
in
his
capacity
for
deception
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
say
when
she
comes
his
mind
was
all
undecided
and
yet
the
minutes
were
flying
besides
he
had
no
idea
in
what
frame
of
mind
elena
might
arrive
it
wanted
but
two
or
three
minutes
now
to
the
hour
his
excitement
was
so
great
that
he
felt
half
suffocated
he
returned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
steps
of
the
trinità
she
used
always
to
come
up
those
steps
and
when
she
reached
the
top
would
halt
for
a
moment
before
rapidly
crossing
the
square
in
front
of
the
casa
casteldelfina
through
the
silence
he
often
heard
the
tapping
of
her
light
footsteps
on
the
pavement
below
the
clock
struck
four
the
rumble
of
carriage
wheels
came
up
from
the
piazza
di
spagna
and
the
pincio
a
great
many
people
were
strolling
under
the
trees
in
front
of
the
villa
medici
two
women
seated
on
a
stone
bench
beside
the
church
were
keeping
watch
over
some
children
playing
round
the
obelisk
which
shone
rosy
red
under
the
sunset
and
cast
a
long
slanting
shadow
the
air
freshened
as
the
sun
sank
lower
farther
off
the
city
stood
out
golden
against
the
colourless
clear
sky
which
made
the
cypresses
on
the
monte
mario
look
jet
black
andrea
started
a
shadow
stole
up
the
little
flight
of
steps
beside
the
casa
casteldelfina
leading
up
from
the
piazzetta
mignanelli
it
was
not
elena
it
was
some
other
lady
who
slowly
turned
the
corner
into
the
via
gregoriana
if
she
did
not
come
at
all
he
said
to
himself
as
he
left
the
window
coming
away
from
the
colder
outside
air
he
felt
the
warmth
of
the
room
all
the
more
cosy
the
scent
of
the
burning
wood
and
the
roses
more
piercing
sweet
the
shadow
of
the
curtains
and
portières
more
delightfully
mysterious
at
that
moment
the
whole
room
seemed
on
the
alert
for
the
arrival
of
the
woman
he
loved
he
imagined
sensations
on
entering
it
was
hardly
possible
that
she
should
be
able
to
resist
the
influence
of
these
surroundings
so
full
of
tender
memories
for
her
she
would
suddenly
lose
all
sense
of
time
and
reality
would
fancy
herself
back
at
one
of
the
old
rendezvous
the
elena
of
those
happy
days
since
nothing
was
altered
in
the
of
their
love
why
should
their
love
itself
be
changed
she
must
of
necessity
feel
the
profound
charm
of
all
these
things
which
once
upon
a
time
had
been
so
dear
to
her
and
now
the
anguish
of
hope
deferred
created
a
fresh
torture
for
him
minds
that
have
the
habit
of
imaginative
contemplation
and
poetic
dreaming
attribute
to
inanimate
objects
a
soul
sensitive
and
variable
as
their
own
and
recognise
in
all
things
be
it
form
or
colour
sound
or
perfume
a
transparent
symbol
an
emblem
of
some
emotion
or
thought
in
every
phenomenon
and
every
group
of
phenomena
they
claim
to
discover
a
psychical
condition
a
moral
significance
at
times
the
vision
is
so
lucid
as
to
produce
actual
pain
in
such
minds
they
feel
themselves
overwhelmed
by
the
plenitude
of
life
revealed
to
them
and
are
terrified
by
the
phantom
of
their
own
creation
thus
andrea
saw
his
own
dire
distress
reflected
in
the
aspect
of
the
objects
surrounding
him
and
as
his
own
fond
desires
seemed
wasting
fruitlessly
in
this
protracted
expectation
so
the
erotic
essence
so
to
speak
of
the
room
appeared
to
be
evaporating
and
exhaling
uselessly
in
his
eyes
these
apartments
in
which
he
had
loved
and
also
suffered
so
much
had
acquired
something
of
his
own
sensibility
had
not
only
been
witness
of
his
loves
his
pleasures
his
sorrows
but
had
taken
part
in
it
all
in
his
memories
every
outline
every
tint
harmonised
with
some
feminine
image
was
a
note
in
a
chord
of
beauty
an
element
in
an
ecstasy
of
passion
the
very
nature
of
his
tastes
led
him
to
seek
for
a
diversity
of
enjoyment
in
his
love
and
seeing
that
he
set
out
upon
that
quest
as
an
accomplished
artist
and
æsthetic
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
derive
a
great
part
of
his
delight
from
the
world
of
external
objects
to
this
fastidious
actor
the
comedy
of
love
was
nothing
without
the
scenery
from
that
point
of
view
his
stage
was
certainly
quite
perfect
and
he
himself
a
most
adroit
for
he
almost
always
entered
heart
and
soul
into
his
own
artifice
he
forgot
himself
so
completely
that
he
was
deceived
by
his
own
deception
fell
into
the
trap
of
his
own
laying
and
wounded
himself
with
his
own
weapons
a
magician
enclosed
in
the
spells
of
his
own
weaving
the
roses
in
the
tall
florentine
vases
they
too
were
waiting
and
breathing
out
their
sweetness
on
the
divan
cover
and
on
the
walls
inscriptions
on
silver
scrolls
singing
the
praises
of
woman
and
of
wine
gleamed
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
and
harmonised
admirably
with
the
faded
colours
of
the
sixteenth
century
persian
carpet
elsewhere
the
shadow
was
deeply
transparent
and
as
if
animated
by
that
indefinable
luminous
tremor
felt
in
hidden
sanctuaries
where
some
mystic
treasure
lies
enshrined
the
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
each
flame
as
shelley
puts
it
like
a
separate
jewel
dissolved
in
ever
moving
light
to
andrea
it
seemed
that
at
that
moment
every
shape
every
colour
every
perfume
gave
forth
the
essential
and
delicate
spirit
of
its
being
and
yet
came
not
came
not
for
the
first
time
the
thought
of
her
husband
presented
itself
to
him
elena
was
no
longer
free
some
months
after
her
abrupt
departure
from
rome
she
had
renounced
the
agreeable
liberty
of
widowhood
to
marry
an
english
nobleman
lord
humphrey
heathfield
andrea
had
seen
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
in
a
society
paper
in
the
october
following
and
had
heard
a
world
of
comment
on
the
new
lady
humphrey
in
every
country
house
he
stayed
in
during
the
autumn
he
remembered
also
having
met
lord
humphrey
some
half
a
score
of
times
during
the
preceding
winter
at
the
saturdays
of
the
princess
or
in
the
public
he
was
a
man
of
about
forty
with
colourless
fair
hair
bald
at
the
temples
an
excessively
pale
face
a
pair
of
piercing
light
eyes
and
a
prominent
forehead
on
which
a
network
of
veins
stood
out
he
had
his
name
of
heathfield
from
that
who
was
the
hero
of
the
defence
of
gibraltar
and
afterwards
immortalised
by
the
brush
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
what
part
had
this
man
in
elena
life
what
ties
beyond
the
convention
of
marriage
bound
her
to
him
what
transformations
had
the
physical
and
moral
contact
of
this
husband
brought
to
pass
in
her
these
enigmas
rose
tumultuously
before
him
making
his
pain
so
intolerable
that
he
started
up
with
the
instinctive
bound
of
a
man
who
has
been
stabbed
unawares
he
crossed
the
room
to
the
and
listened
at
the
door
which
he
had
left
ajar
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
a
quarter
to
five
the
next
moment
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
stair
the
rustle
of
skirts
and
a
quick
panting
breath
a
woman
was
coming
up
hurriedly
his
heart
beat
with
such
vehemence
that
his
nerves
all
unstrung
by
his
long
suspense
he
felt
hardly
able
to
stand
on
his
feet
the
steps
drew
nearer
there
was
a
sigh
a
step
upon
the
landing
at
the
door
elena
entered
elena
at
last
there
was
in
that
cry
such
a
profound
accent
of
agony
endured
that
it
brought
to
elena
lips
an
indescribable
smile
mingled
of
pleasure
and
pity
he
took
her
by
her
ungloved
right
hand
and
drew
her
into
the
room
she
was
still
a
little
out
of
breath
and
under
her
black
veil
a
faint
flush
diffused
itself
over
her
whole
face
me
andrea
i
could
not
get
away
any
sooner
there
is
so
much
to
do
so
many
calls
to
return
such
tiring
days
i
hardly
know
where
to
turn
how
warm
it
is
in
here
what
a
delicious
smell
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
little
undecided
and
ill
at
ease
in
spite
of
her
rapid
and
lightly
spoken
words
a
velvet
coat
with
empire
sleeves
very
full
at
the
shoulders
and
buttoned
closely
at
the
wrists
and
with
an
immense
collar
of
blue
fox
for
sole
trimming
covered
her
from
head
to
foot
but
without
disguising
the
grace
of
her
figure
she
looked
at
andrea
with
eyes
in
which
a
curious
tremulous
smile
softened
the
flash
and
sparkle
have
changed
somehow
she
said
do
quite
know
what
it
is
but
round
your
mouth
for
instance
there
are
bitter
lines
that
used
not
to
be
there
she
spoke
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
familiarity
the
sound
of
her
voice
once
more
in
this
room
caused
him
such
exquisite
delight
that
he
exclaimed
again
elena
go
on
speaking
she
laughed
she
asked
know
why
he
answered
taking
her
hand
again
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
looked
the
young
man
deep
in
the
eyes
know
nothing
any
more
you
have
changed
very
much
very
much
indeed
they
had
both
dropped
their
bantering
tone
elena
answer
threw
a
sudden
upon
much
that
was
problematical
before
andrea
understood
and
with
that
rapid
and
precise
intuition
so
often
found
in
minds
practised
in
psychological
analysis
he
instantly
divined
the
moral
attitude
of
his
visitor
and
foresaw
the
further
development
of
the
coming
scene
moreover
he
was
already
under
the
spell
of
this
woman
fascination
as
in
the
former
days
besides
being
greatly
piqued
by
curiosity
you
not
sit
down
he
asked
for
a
moment
in
this
she
was
on
the
point
of
exclaiming
for
she
recognised
an
old
friend
but
she
stopped
herself
in
time
the
chair
was
deep
and
roomy
and
covered
with
antique
leather
on
which
pale
dragons
ramped
in
relief
after
the
style
of
the
wall
decorations
of
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
chigi
palace
the
leather
had
taken
on
that
warm
and
sumptuous
tone
which
recalls
the
background
of
certain
venetian
portraits
or
a
fine
bronze
still
retaining
traces
of
former
gilding
or
a
piece
of
with
gleams
of
gold
here
and
there
a
great
cushion
covered
with
a
piece
of
a
dalmatic
of
faded
colouring
of
that
peculiar
shade
which
the
florentine
silk
merchants
used
to
call
di
gruogo
saffron
red
contributed
to
its
inviting
easiness
elena
seated
herself
in
it
placing
on
the
beside
her
her
right
hand
glove
and
her
a
fragile
toy
in
polished
silver
with
a
device
and
motto
engraven
on
it
she
then
proceeded
to
remove
her
veil
raising
her
arms
high
to
unfasten
the
knot
her
graceful
attitude
throwing
gleams
of
changeful
light
on
the
velvet
of
her
coat
along
the
sleeves
and
over
the
contour
of
her
bust
the
heat
of
the
fire
was
very
strong
and
with
her
bare
hand
which
shone
transparent
like
rosy
alabaster
she
screened
her
face
from
it
the
rings
on
her
fingers
glittered
in
the
firelight
screen
the
fire
she
said
is
really
too
fierce
have
you
lost
your
fondness
for
the
flames
and
you
used
to
be
a
perfect
salamander
this
hearth
is
full
of
memories
memory
sleep
do
not
stir
the
embers
she
interrupted
him
the
fire
and
let
us
have
some
light
i
will
make
the
tea
you
take
off
your
coat
i
must
go
directly
it
is
late
you
will
be
melted
she
rose
with
a
little
gesture
of
impatience
well
then
help
me
please
as
he
helped
her
off
with
the
mantle
andrea
noticed
that
the
scent
was
not
the
same
as
the
familiar
one
of
old
however
it
was
so
delicious
that
it
thrilled
his
every
sense
have
a
new
scent
he
said
with
peculiar
emphasis
she
answered
simply
you
like
it
andrea
still
held
the
mantle
in
his
hands
he
buried
his
face
in
the
fur
collar
which
had
been
next
her
throat
and
her
hair
is
it
called
he
inquired
has
no
name
she
herself
in
the
within
the
circle
of
the
firelight
her
dress
was
of
black
lace
on
which
sparkled
a
mass
of
tiny
jet
and
steel
beads
the
day
was
fading
from
the
windows
andrea
lit
candles
of
twisted
wax
in
candlesticks
after
which
he
drew
a
screen
before
the
fire
during
this
pause
both
felt
a
certain
perplexing
uneasiness
elena
was
no
longer
exactly
conscious
of
the
moment
nor
was
she
quite
mistress
of
herself
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
she
was
unable
to
recall
with
precision
her
motives
for
coming
here
to
follow
out
her
intentions
even
to
regain
her
force
of
will
in
the
presence
of
this
man
to
whom
once
upon
a
time
she
had
been
bound
by
such
passionate
ties
and
in
this
spot
where
she
lived
the
most
ardent
moments
of
her
life
she
felt
her
reserve
melting
her
mind
wavering
and
growing
feeble
she
was
at
that
dangerously
delicious
point
of
sentiment
at
which
the
soul
receives
its
every
impulse
its
attitudes
its
form
from
its
external
surroundings
as
an
aërial
vapour
from
the
mutations
of
the
atmosphere
but
she
checked
herself
before
wholly
giving
way
to
it
that
right
now
asked
andrea
in
a
low
almost
humble
voice
she
smiled
without
replying
his
words
had
given
her
inexpressibly
keen
delight
she
began
her
delicate
manipulations
lit
the
under
the
kettle
opened
the
lacquer
and
put
the
necessary
quantity
of
aromatic
leaves
into
the
and
finally
prepared
two
cups
her
movements
were
slow
and
a
little
hesitating
as
happens
when
the
mind
is
busied
with
other
things
than
the
occupation
of
the
moment
her
exquisite
white
hands
hovered
over
the
cups
with
the
airiness
of
butterflies
and
from
her
whole
lithe
form
there
emanated
an
indefinable
charm
which
enveloped
her
lover
like
a
caress
seated
quite
close
to
her
gazing
at
her
from
under
his
lids
andrea
drank
in
the
subtle
fascination
of
her
presence
neither
of
them
spoke
elena
leaning
back
in
the
cushions
waited
for
the
water
to
boil
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
blue
flame
while
she
absently
slipped
her
rings
up
and
down
her
fingers
lost
in
a
dream
apparently
but
it
was
no
dream
it
was
rather
a
vague
reminiscence
faint
confused
and
evanescent
all
the
recollections
of
the
love
that
was
past
rose
up
in
her
mind
but
dimly
and
uncertain
leaving
an
indistinct
impression
she
hardly
knew
whether
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
it
was
like
the
indefinable
perfume
of
a
faded
bouquet
in
which
each
separate
flower
has
lost
the
vivacity
proper
to
its
colour
and
its
fragrance
but
from
which
emanates
a
common
perfume
wherein
all
the
diverse
component
elements
are
indistinguishably
blended
she
seemed
to
carry
in
her
heart
the
last
breath
of
memories
already
faded
the
last
trace
of
joys
departed
for
ever
the
last
tremor
of
a
happiness
that
was
dead
something
akin
to
a
mist
from
out
of
which
images
emerge
fitfully
without
shape
or
name
she
knew
not
was
it
pleasure
or
pain
but
by
degrees
this
mysterious
agitation
this
nameless
disquiet
waxed
greater
and
filled
her
soul
with
joy
and
bitterness
she
was
silent
withdrawn
within
herself
for
though
her
heart
was
full
to
overflowing
her
emotion
was
pleasurably
increased
by
that
silence
speech
would
have
broken
the
charm
the
kettle
began
its
low
song
andrea
on
a
low
seat
with
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
chin
in
his
hand
sat
watching
the
fair
woman
so
intently
that
elena
without
turning
felt
that
persistent
gaze
upon
her
with
a
sense
of
physical
discomfort
and
while
he
gazed
upon
her
he
thought
to
himself
that
she
seemed
altogether
a
new
woman
to
him
one
who
had
never
been
his
whom
he
had
never
clasped
to
his
heart
and
in
truth
she
was
even
more
desirable
than
in
the
former
days
the
plastic
enigma
of
her
beauty
more
obscure
and
more
enthralling
her
head
with
the
low
broad
forehead
straight
nose
and
arched
eyebrows
so
pure
and
firm
in
outline
so
classically
antique
in
the
modelling
might
have
come
from
some
syracusan
coin
the
expression
of
the
eyes
and
that
of
the
mouth
were
in
singular
contrast
giving
her
that
passionate
ambiguous
almost
preternatural
look
that
only
one
or
two
deeply
imbued
in
all
the
profoundest
corruption
of
art
have
been
able
to
infuse
into
such
immortal
types
of
woman
as
the
mona
lisa
and
nelly
the
steam
began
to
escape
through
the
hole
in
the
lid
of
the
kettle
and
elena
turned
her
attention
once
more
to
the
she
poured
a
little
water
on
the
leaves
put
two
lumps
of
sugar
in
one
of
the
cups
then
poured
some
more
water
into
the
and
extinguished
the
lamp
doing
it
all
with
a
certain
fond
care
but
never
once
looking
in
andrea
direction
by
this
time
her
inward
agitation
had
resolved
itself
into
such
melting
tenderness
that
there
was
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
her
eyes
filled
involuntarily
all
her
contradictory
thoughts
all
her
trouble
and
agitation
of
heart
concentrated
themselves
in
those
tears
a
movement
of
her
arm
knocked
the
little
silver
off
the
table
andrea
picked
it
up
and
examined
the
device
two
true
lovers
knots
each
bearing
an
inscription
in
english
and
stranger
when
he
raised
his
head
elena
offered
him
the
fragrant
beverage
with
a
mist
of
tears
before
her
eyes
he
saw
that
mist
and
filled
with
love
and
gratitude
at
such
an
sign
of
melting
he
put
down
the
cup
sank
on
his
knees
before
her
and
seizing
her
hand
pressed
his
lips
passionately
to
it
elena
he
murmured
his
face
close
to
hers
as
if
he
would
drink
the
breath
from
her
lips
his
emotion
was
quite
sincere
though
some
of
the
things
he
said
were
not
he
loved
her
had
always
loved
her
had
never
never
never
been
able
to
forget
her
on
meeting
her
again
he
had
felt
his
passion
rekindle
with
such
vehemence
that
it
had
given
him
a
kind
of
shock
of
terror
as
if
in
one
lightning
flash
he
had
witnessed
the
upheaval
the
convulsion
of
his
whole
life
hush
said
elena
with
a
look
of
pain
and
turning
very
pale
but
andrea
went
on
still
on
his
knees
fanning
the
flames
of
his
passion
by
the
images
he
himself
evoked
when
she
had
left
him
so
abruptly
he
had
felt
that
the
greater
and
better
part
of
him
went
with
her
afterwards
never
never
could
he
tell
her
all
the
misery
of
those
days
the
agony
of
regret
the
ceaseless
implacable
devouring
torture
of
mind
and
body
his
wretchedness
grew
and
increased
daily
till
it
burst
all
bounds
and
overwhelmed
him
utterly
despair
lay
in
wait
for
him
at
every
turn
the
mere
flight
of
time
became
an
intolerable
burden
his
regrets
were
less
for
the
happy
days
gone
by
than
for
those
that
were
passing
all
profitless
for
love
those
at
least
had
left
him
a
memory
these
nothing
but
profoundest
regret
nay
almost
remorse
his
life
was
preying
upon
itself
consumed
in
secret
by
the
inextinguishable
flame
of
one
desire
by
the
unconquerable
distaste
to
any
other
form
of
pleasure
of
all
the
fiery
ardour
of
his
youth
nothing
now
remained
to
him
but
a
handful
of
ashes
sometimes
like
a
dream
that
vanishes
at
dawn
all
the
past
all
the
present
would
fade
and
fall
away
from
his
inner
consciousness
like
a
tale
that
is
told
a
useless
garment
then
he
would
remember
the
past
no
more
as
a
man
newly
risen
from
a
long
illness
a
convalescent
still
overcome
with
stupor
at
last
he
could
forget
his
tortured
soul
was
sinking
gently
down
to
but
suddenly
out
of
the
depths
of
this
lethal
tranquillity
his
pain
had
sprung
up
afresh
and
the
fallen
idol
was
higher
than
ever
she
and
she
alone
held
every
fibre
of
his
heart
captive
beneath
her
spells
crushing
out
his
intelligence
keeping
the
doors
of
his
soul
against
any
other
passion
any
sorrow
any
dream
to
the
end
of
all
time
he
was
lying
of
course
but
his
words
were
so
fervid
his
voice
so
thrilling
the
clasp
of
his
hands
so
fondly
caressing
that
elena
was
profoundly
touched
she
said
must
not
dare
not
listen
to
you
i
am
yours
no
longer
i
never
can
be
yours
again
never
do
not
say
these
things
listen
will
not
i
must
go
now
andrea
it
is
late
let
me
go
she
drew
her
hands
out
of
the
young
man
clasp
and
successfully
throwing
off
the
dangerous
languor
that
was
creeping
over
her
she
prepared
to
rise
why
did
you
come
he
asked
almost
roughly
and
preventing
her
from
doing
so
slight
as
was
the
force
he
used
she
frowned
she
paused
before
answering
came
she
said
in
measured
accents
and
looking
her
lover
full
in
the
eyes
came
because
you
asked
me
for
the
sake
of
the
love
that
was
once
between
us
for
the
manner
in
which
that
love
was
broken
and
for
the
long
and
unexplained
silence
of
my
absence
i
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
your
invitation
besides
i
wanted
to
say
what
i
have
said
that
i
am
no
longer
yours
that
i
never
can
be
again
never
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
honestly
and
frankly
to
save
you
and
myself
all
painful
disillusionment
all
danger
or
bitterness
in
the
do
you
understand
andrea
bowed
his
head
almost
to
her
knee
in
silence
she
stroked
his
hair
with
a
familiar
gesture
of
old
then
she
went
on
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
him
to
the
core
then
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
love
you
as
much
as
ever
that
you
are
still
the
heart
of
my
heart
and
that
i
will
be
the
fondest
of
sisters
to
you
the
best
of
friends
do
you
understand
andrea
made
no
reply
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
raised
it
forcing
him
to
look
her
in
the
face
you
understand
she
repeated
in
a
still
lower
sweeter
tone
her
eyes
under
the
shadow
of
the
long
lashes
were
suffused
with
a
pure
and
tender
light
her
lips
were
slightly
open
and
trembling
you
never
loved
me
and
you
do
not
love
me
now
andrea
burst
out
at
last
pulling
elena
hands
from
his
temples
and
drawing
away
from
her
for
he
was
sensible
of
the
fire
that
was
kindling
in
his
veins
under
the
mere
gaze
of
those
eyes
and
his
regret
at
having
lost
possession
of
this
fairest
of
women
grew
more
bitter
and
poignant
than
before
you
never
loved
me
you
had
the
heart
to
strike
your
love
dead
at
a
blow
treacherously
almost
just
when
it
had
reached
its
supremest
height
you
ran
away
you
deserted
me
left
me
alone
in
my
bewilderment
my
misery
while
i
was
still
blinded
by
your
promises
you
never
loved
me
neither
then
nor
now
and
now
after
such
a
long
absence
so
full
of
mystery
so
silent
and
inexorable
after
i
have
wasted
the
bloom
of
my
life
in
cherishing
a
wound
that
was
dear
to
me
because
your
hand
had
dealt
it
after
so
much
joy
and
so
much
pain
you
return
to
this
room
in
which
every
object
is
replete
for
us
with
living
memories
and
you
say
to
me
calmly
i
am
yours
no
longer
oh
no
you
do
not
love
me
you
are
ungrateful
she
cried
deeply
wounded
by
the
young
incensed
tone
do
you
know
of
all
that
has
occurred
or
of
what
i
have
had
to
go
through
what
do
you
know
know
nothing
and
what
is
more
i
do
not
want
to
andrea
retorted
stubbornly
enveloping
her
in
a
darkling
look
in
which
burned
the
fever
of
his
desire
i
know
is
that
you
were
mine
once
wholly
and
without
reserve
and
i
know
that
body
and
soul
i
shall
never
forget
it
silent
do
i
care
for
your
sisterly
affection
in
spite
of
yourself
you
offer
it
with
your
eyes
full
of
quite
another
kind
of
love
and
you
can
not
touch
me
without
your
hands
trembling
i
have
seen
that
look
in
your
eyes
too
often
you
have
too
often
felt
me
tremble
with
passion
beneath
your
hands
i
love
you
carried
away
by
his
own
words
he
grasped
her
wrists
tightly
and
drew
so
close
to
her
that
she
felt
his
hot
breath
on
her
cheek
love
you
i
tell
you
more
than
ever
before
he
went
on
slipping
an
arm
about
her
waist
to
draw
her
to
his
kiss
you
forgotten
have
you
forgotten
she
pushed
him
forcibly
from
her
and
rose
to
her
feet
trembling
in
every
limb
will
not
do
you
hear
but
he
would
not
hear
he
came
towards
her
with
arms
outstretched
very
pale
and
determined
you
bear
she
cried
turning
at
bay
at
last
indignant
at
his
violence
you
bear
to
share
me
with
another
she
flung
the
cruel
question
at
him
without
reflection
and
now
stood
looking
at
her
lover
with
wide
open
frightened
eyes
like
one
who
in
has
dealt
a
blow
without
measuring
his
strength
and
fears
to
have
struck
too
deep
andrea
frenzy
dropped
on
the
instant
and
his
face
expressed
such
overwhelming
pain
that
elena
was
stricken
to
the
heart
after
a
moment
silence
he
said
but
that
one
word
contained
all
the
bitterness
of
the
words
he
refrained
from
saying
she
answered
gently
me
they
both
felt
the
necessity
of
putting
an
end
at
least
for
that
evening
to
this
perilous
conversation
andrea
affected
an
almost
courtesy
elena
became
even
gentler
almost
humble
a
nervous
tremor
shook
her
continually
she
took
her
cloak
from
the
chair
and
andrea
hastened
to
assist
her
as
she
did
not
succeed
in
finding
the
armholes
andrea
guided
her
hand
to
it
but
scarcely
touched
her
he
then
offered
her
her
hat
and
veil
is
a
in
the
next
room
if
you
would
like
thank
you
she
went
over
beside
the
fireplace
where
on
the
wall
hung
a
quaint
little
old
mirror
in
a
frame
surrounded
by
little
figures
carved
in
so
airy
and
vivacious
a
style
that
they
seemed
rather
to
be
of
malleable
gold
than
of
wood
it
was
a
charming
thing
the
work
doubtless
of
some
delicate
artist
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
designed
to
reflect
the
charms
of
some
mona
amorrosisca
or
some
laldomine
many
a
time
in
the
old
happy
days
elena
had
put
on
her
veil
in
front
of
this
dim
lack
lustre
mirror
she
remembered
it
again
now
on
seeing
her
reflection
rise
out
of
its
misty
depths
she
was
stirred
by
a
singular
emotion
a
rush
of
profound
sadness
came
over
her
she
did
not
speak
all
this
time
andrea
was
watching
her
intently
her
preparations
concluded
she
said
must
be
very
late
very
about
six
i
think
sent
away
my
carriage
i
would
be
very
grateful
if
you
could
send
for
a
closed
cab
for
me
you
excuse
me
then
if
i
leave
you
alone
for
a
moment
my
servant
is
out
she
assented
please
tell
the
man
yourself
where
to
go
to
the
hotel
quirinal
he
went
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
she
was
alone
she
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
her
embracing
the
whole
room
with
an
indefinable
look
that
lingered
on
the
vases
of
flowers
the
room
seemed
to
her
larger
the
ceiling
higher
than
she
remembered
she
began
to
feel
a
little
giddy
she
did
not
notice
the
scent
of
the
flowers
any
longer
but
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
close
and
heavy
as
in
a
andrea
image
appeared
to
her
in
a
sort
of
intermittent
flashes
a
vague
echo
of
his
voice
rang
in
her
ears
was
she
going
to
faint
oh
the
delight
of
it
if
she
might
close
her
eyes
and
abandon
herself
to
this
languor
she
gave
herself
a
little
shake
and
went
over
to
one
of
the
windows
which
she
opened
and
let
the
breeze
blow
in
her
face
somewhat
revived
by
this
she
turned
back
into
the
room
the
pale
flame
of
the
candles
sent
flickering
shadows
over
the
walls
the
fire
burned
low
but
sufficed
to
light
up
in
part
the
pious
figures
on
the
screen
made
of
stained
glass
from
a
church
window
the
cup
of
tea
stood
where
andrea
had
laid
it
down
on
the
table
cold
and
untouched
the
chair
cushion
retained
the
impress
of
the
form
that
had
leaned
against
it
all
the
objects
surrounding
her
breathed
an
ineffable
melancholy
which
condensed
itself
in
a
heavy
weight
upon
elena
heart
till
it
sank
beneath
the
well
nigh
insupportable
burden
dio
mio
dio
she
wished
she
could
make
her
escape
unseen
a
puff
of
wind
inflated
the
curtains
made
the
candles
flicker
raised
a
general
rustle
through
the
room
she
shivered
and
almost
without
knowing
what
she
did
she
called
her
own
voice
that
name
in
the
silence
startled
her
strangely
as
if
neither
voice
nor
name
had
come
from
her
lips
why
was
andrea
so
long
in
returning
she
there
was
no
sound
but
the
dull
deep
inarticulate
murmur
of
the
city
not
a
carriage
passed
across
the
piazza
of
the
trinità
de
monti
as
the
wind
came
in
strong
gusts
from
time
to
time
she
closed
the
window
catching
a
glimpse
as
she
did
so
of
the
point
of
the
obelisk
black
against
the
starry
sky
possibly
andrea
had
not
found
a
conveyance
at
once
on
the
piazza
barberini
she
sat
herself
down
to
wait
on
the
sofa
and
tried
to
calm
her
foolish
agitation
avoiding
all
heartsearchings
and
endeavouring
to
fix
her
attention
on
external
objects
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
figures
on
the
faintly
visible
by
the
light
of
the
dying
logs
on
the
mantelpiece
a
great
white
rose
in
one
of
the
vases
was
dropping
its
petals
softly
languidly
one
by
one
giving
an
impression
of
something
subtly
feminine
and
sensuous
the
petals
rested
delicately
on
the
marble
like
flakes
of
snow
ah
how
sweet
that
fragrant
snow
had
been
she
thought
strewed
the
carpets
the
divan
the
chairs
and
she
was
laughing
happy
in
the
midst
of
the
devastation
and
her
happy
lover
was
at
her
feet
a
carriage
stopped
down
in
the
street
she
rose
and
shook
her
aching
head
to
banish
the
dull
weight
that
seemed
to
paralyse
her
the
next
moment
andrea
entered
out
of
breath
me
he
said
keeping
you
so
long
but
i
could
not
find
the
porter
so
i
went
down
to
the
piazza
di
spagna
the
carriage
is
waiting
for
you
answered
elena
with
a
timid
glance
at
him
through
her
black
veil
he
was
grave
and
pale
but
quite
calm
expect
my
husband
she
went
on
in
a
low
faint
voice
will
send
you
a
line
to
let
you
know
when
i
can
see
you
again
you
answered
andrea
then
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
see
you
down
to
the
street
there
is
no
one
there
come
down
with
me
she
looked
about
her
a
little
hesitatingly
you
forgotten
anything
asked
andrea
she
was
looking
at
the
flowers
but
she
answered
yes
my
andrea
sprang
to
fetch
it
from
the
table
stranger
he
read
as
he
handed
it
to
her
my
dear
a
her
answer
was
quick
her
voice
eager
then
suddenly
with
a
smile
peculiarly
her
own
half
imploring
half
seductive
a
mixture
of
timidity
and
tenderness
she
said
me
a
andrea
went
from
vase
to
vase
gathering
all
the
roses
into
one
great
bunch
which
he
could
scarcely
hold
in
his
hands
some
of
them
shed
their
petals
were
for
you
all
of
them
he
said
without
looking
at
her
elena
hung
her
head
and
turned
to
go
in
silence
followed
by
andrea
they
descended
the
stairs
still
in
silence
he
could
see
the
nape
of
her
neck
so
fair
and
delicate
where
the
little
dark
curls
mingled
with
the
fur
he
cried
her
name
in
a
low
voice
incapable
any
longer
of
fighting
against
the
passion
that
filled
his
heart
to
bursting
she
turned
round
to
him
with
a
finger
on
her
lips
a
gesture
of
agonised
entreaty
but
her
eyes
burned
through
the
shadow
she
hastened
her
steps
flung
herself
into
the
carriage
and
felt
rather
than
saw
him
lay
the
roses
in
her
lap
and
when
the
carriage
turned
away
she
threw
herself
back
exhausted
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobs
tearing
the
roses
to
pieces
with
her
poor
frenzied
hands
chapter
iii
so
she
had
come
she
had
come
she
had
the
rooms
in
which
every
piece
of
furniture
every
object
must
retain
some
memory
for
her
and
she
had
said
am
yours
no
more
can
never
be
yours
again
never
and
you
suffer
to
share
me
with
another
yes
she
had
dared
to
fling
those
words
in
his
face
in
that
room
in
sight
of
all
these
things
a
rush
of
pain
atrocious
immeasurable
made
up
of
a
thousand
wounds
each
distinct
from
the
other
and
one
more
piercing
than
the
other
came
over
him
and
goaded
him
to
desperation
passion
enveloped
him
once
more
in
a
thousand
tongues
of
fire
in
him
an
inextinguishable
desire
for
this
woman
who
belonged
to
him
no
more
in
his
memory
every
smallest
detail
of
past
caresses
and
all
the
sweet
mad
doings
of
those
days
and
yet
through
it
all
there
persisted
the
strange
difficulty
in
identifying
that
elena
with
the
elena
of
who
seemed
to
him
altogether
another
woman
one
whom
he
had
never
known
never
held
in
his
arms
the
torture
of
his
senses
was
such
that
he
thought
he
must
die
of
it
impurity
crept
through
his
blood
like
a
corroding
poison
the
impurity
which
the
winged
flame
of
the
soul
had
covered
with
a
sacred
veil
had
surrounded
with
a
mystery
that
was
half
divine
appeared
without
the
veil
and
without
the
mystery
as
a
mere
carnal
lust
a
piece
of
gross
sensuality
he
knew
that
the
ardour
he
had
felt
in
her
presence
was
not
love
had
nothing
in
common
with
love
for
when
she
had
cried
you
suffer
to
share
me
with
another
why
yes
he
could
suffer
it
perfectly
nothing
therefore
nothing
in
him
had
remained
intact
even
the
memory
of
his
grand
passion
was
now
corrupted
sullied
debased
the
last
spark
of
hope
was
extinct
he
had
reached
his
lowest
level
never
to
rise
again
he
was
seized
by
a
terrible
and
frenzied
desire
to
overthrow
the
idol
that
still
persistently
rose
up
lofty
and
enigmatic
before
his
imagination
do
what
he
would
to
abase
it
with
cynical
cruelty
he
set
himself
to
insult
to
undermine
to
mutilate
it
the
destructive
analysis
he
had
already
employed
upon
himself
he
now
turned
upon
elena
to
those
dubious
problems
which
at
one
time
he
had
resolutely
put
away
from
him
he
now
sought
the
answer
of
all
the
suspicions
which
had
formerly
presented
themselves
to
him
only
to
disappear
without
leaving
a
trace
he
now
studied
the
origin
found
them
justified
and
obtained
their
confirmation
but
whereas
he
thought
to
find
relief
in
this
furious
work
of
demolition
he
only
increased
his
sufferings
aggravated
his
malady
and
deepened
his
wounds
what
had
been
the
true
cause
of
elena
departure
two
years
before
there
were
many
conflicting
rumours
at
the
time
and
again
when
she
married
humphrey
heathfield
but
the
actual
truth
of
the
matter
was
what
he
heard
quite
by
chance
among
other
scraps
of
society
gossip
from
giulio
musellaro
one
evening
as
they
left
the
theatre
together
nor
did
andrea
doubt
it
for
a
moment
donna
elena
had
been
obliged
to
leave
rome
for
pecuniary
reasons
to
work
some
which
should
extricate
her
from
the
serious
embarrassments
into
which
her
outrageous
extravagance
had
plunged
her
the
marriage
with
humphrey
heathfield
who
was
marquis
of
mount
saint
michael
and
earl
of
broadford
and
besides
possessing
a
considerable
fortune
was
related
to
the
highest
nobility
of
great
britain
had
saved
her
from
ruin
donna
elena
had
managed
matters
with
the
utmost
adroitness
and
succeeded
marvellously
in
steering
clear
of
the
threatening
peril
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
the
interval
of
her
three
years
of
widowhood
had
been
none
too
chaste
a
prelude
to
a
second
marriage
neither
chaste
nor
prudent
nevertheless
there
was
also
no
denying
that
elena
muti
was
a
great
lady
my
boy
a
grand
creature
said
musellaro
you
very
well
know
andrea
said
nothing
take
my
advice
his
friend
went
on
throwing
away
the
cigarette
which
had
gone
out
while
he
talked
not
resume
your
relations
with
her
it
is
the
same
with
love
as
with
tobacco
once
out
it
will
not
bear
relighting
let
us
go
and
get
a
cup
of
tea
from
donna
giulia
moceto
they
tell
me
one
may
go
to
her
house
after
the
theatre
it
is
never
too
late
they
were
close
by
the
palazzo
borghese
can
answered
andrea
am
going
home
to
bed
i
am
rather
tired
after
run
with
the
hounds
my
regards
to
donna
giulia
my
blessing
go
with
you
musellaro
went
up
the
steps
of
the
palace
and
andrea
continued
on
his
way
past
the
borghese
fountain
towards
the
trinità
it
was
one
of
those
wonderful
january
nights
cold
and
serene
which
turn
rome
into
a
city
of
silver
set
in
a
ring
of
diamonds
the
full
moon
hanging
in
shed
a
triple
purity
of
light
of
frost
and
of
silence
he
walked
along
in
the
moonlight
like
a
somnambulist
conscious
of
nothing
but
his
pain
the
last
blow
had
been
struck
the
idol
was
shattered
nothing
remained
standing
above
the
ruins
this
was
the
end
so
it
was
true
she
had
never
really
loved
him
she
had
not
scrupled
to
break
with
him
in
order
to
contract
a
marriage
of
convenience
and
now
she
put
on
the
airs
of
a
martyr
before
him
wrapped
herself
round
with
a
mantle
of
conjugal
inviolability
a
bitter
laugh
rose
to
his
lips
and
then
a
rush
of
sullen
blind
rage
against
the
woman
came
over
him
the
memory
of
his
passion
went
for
nothing
all
the
past
was
one
long
fraud
one
stupendous
hideous
lie
and
this
man
who
throughout
his
whole
life
had
made
a
practice
of
dissimulation
and
duplicity
was
now
incensed
at
the
deception
of
another
was
as
indignant
at
it
as
at
some
unpardonable
backsliding
some
inexcusable
and
inexplicable
perfidy
he
was
quite
unable
to
understand
how
elena
could
have
committed
such
a
crime
he
denied
her
all
possibility
of
justification
and
rejected
the
hypothesis
of
some
secret
and
dire
necessity
having
driven
her
to
sudden
flight
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
bare
brutal
fact
its
baseness
its
vulgarity
above
all
its
vulgarity
gross
manifest
odious
without
one
extenuating
circumstance
in
short
the
whole
matter
reduced
itself
to
this
a
passion
which
was
apparently
sincere
which
they
had
vowed
was
profound
and
inextinguishable
had
been
broken
off
for
a
question
of
money
for
material
interests
for
a
commercial
transaction
you
are
ungrateful
what
do
you
know
of
all
that
has
happened
of
all
i
have
suffered
elena
words
recurred
to
him
with
everything
else
she
had
said
from
beginning
to
end
of
their
interview
her
words
of
fondness
her
offer
of
sisterly
affection
all
her
sentimental
phrases
and
he
remembered
too
the
tears
that
had
dimmed
her
eyes
her
changes
of
countenance
her
tremors
her
choking
voice
when
she
said
and
he
laid
the
roses
in
her
lap
why
had
she
ever
consented
to
come
why
play
this
part
call
up
all
these
emotions
arrange
this
comedy
why
by
this
time
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
and
found
himself
in
the
deserted
piazza
suddenly
the
beauty
of
the
night
filled
him
with
a
vague
but
desperate
yearning
towards
some
unknown
good
the
image
of
maria
ferrès
flashed
across
his
mind
his
heart
beat
fast
he
thought
of
what
it
would
be
to
hold
her
hands
in
his
to
lean
his
head
upon
her
breast
to
feel
that
she
was
consoling
him
without
words
by
her
pity
alone
this
longing
for
pity
for
a
refuge
was
like
the
last
struggle
of
a
soul
that
will
not
be
content
to
perish
he
bent
his
head
and
entered
the
house
without
turning
again
to
look
at
the
night
terenzio
was
waiting
up
for
him
and
followed
him
to
the
bedroom
where
there
was
a
fire
the
signor
conte
go
to
bed
at
once
he
asked
terenzio
bring
me
some
tea
replied
his
master
sitting
down
before
the
fire
and
stretching
out
his
hands
to
the
blaze
he
was
shivering
all
over
with
a
little
nervous
tremor
signor
conte
is
cold
asked
terenzio
hastening
with
affectionate
interest
to
stir
up
the
fire
and
put
on
fresh
logs
he
was
an
old
servant
of
the
house
of
sperelli
having
served
father
for
many
years
and
his
devotion
for
the
son
reached
the
pitch
of
idolatry
no
human
being
seemed
to
him
so
handsome
so
noble
so
worthy
of
devotion
he
belonged
to
that
ideal
race
which
furnished
faithful
retainers
to
the
romance
writers
of
old
but
differed
from
the
servants
of
romance
in
that
he
spoke
little
never
offered
advice
and
concerned
himself
with
no
other
business
than
that
of
carrying
out
his
orders
will
do
very
nicely
said
andrea
trying
to
repress
the
convulsive
trembling
of
his
limbs
and
crouching
closer
over
the
fire
the
presence
of
the
old
man
in
this
hour
of
misery
and
distress
moved
him
singularly
it
was
an
emotion
somewhat
similar
to
that
which
in
the
presence
of
some
very
kind
and
sympathetic
person
affects
a
man
determined
upon
suicide
never
before
had
the
old
man
brought
back
to
him
so
strongly
the
recollection
of
his
father
the
memory
of
the
beloved
dead
his
grief
for
the
loss
of
a
great
and
good
friend
never
so
much
as
now
had
he
felt
the
want
of
that
comforting
voice
that
paternal
hand
what
would
his
father
say
could
he
see
his
son
thus
crushed
under
the
weight
of
a
nameless
distress
how
would
he
have
sought
to
relieve
him
what
would
he
have
done
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
dead
father
with
boundless
yearning
and
regret
and
he
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
that
in
the
very
teachings
of
that
father
lay
the
primary
cause
of
his
wretchedness
terenzio
brought
the
tea
he
then
proceeded
slowly
to
arrange
the
bed
with
a
care
and
solicitude
that
were
almost
womanly
forgetting
nothing
as
if
he
wished
to
ensure
to
his
master
refreshing
and
unbroken
slumbers
till
the
morrow
andrea
watched
him
with
growing
emotion
to
bed
now
terenzio
he
said
shall
not
want
anything
more
the
old
man
retired
and
left
him
alone
before
the
fire
alone
with
his
heart
alone
with
his
misery
tortured
by
his
inward
agitation
he
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
room
he
was
haunted
by
a
vision
of
elena
and
each
time
he
came
as
far
as
the
window
and
turned
he
fancied
he
saw
her
and
started
violently
his
nerves
were
in
such
an
overstrung
condition
that
they
only
increased
the
disorder
of
his
imagination
the
hallucination
grew
more
distinct
he
stood
still
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
for
a
moment
to
control
his
excitement
and
then
returned
to
his
seat
by
the
fire
this
time
another
image
rose
before
him
that
of
elena
husband
he
knew
him
better
now
that
very
evening
in
a
box
at
the
theatre
elena
had
introduced
them
to
one
another
and
he
had
seized
that
opportunity
to
examine
him
attentively
in
detail
with
the
keenest
curiosity
as
though
he
hoped
to
obtain
some
revelation
to
draw
some
secret
from
him
he
could
still
hear
the
man
voice
a
voice
of
very
peculiar
tone
somewhat
harsh
and
strident
with
an
interrogative
inflection
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
again
he
saw
those
pale
pale
eyes
under
the
great
prominent
forehead
eyes
that
at
times
assumed
a
hideous
glassy
dead
look
and
at
others
lit
up
with
an
indefinable
gleam
that
savoured
of
madness
those
hands
too
he
saw
white
and
smooth
and
thickly
covered
with
sandy
yellow
down
and
with
something
obscene
in
their
every
movement
their
way
of
raising
the
of
unfolding
a
handkerchief
of
reclining
on
the
cushion
in
front
of
the
box
or
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
libretto
hands
instinct
with
vice
oh
horror
he
saw
those
hands
touching
elena
profaning
her
with
their
odious
caresses
the
torture
became
insupportable
he
rose
once
more
went
to
the
window
opened
it
shivered
under
the
biting
breeze
and
shook
himself
the
trinità
de
monti
glittered
in
the
deep
blue
sky
sharply
outlined
as
if
sculptured
in
faintly
tinted
marble
rome
spread
out
beneath
him
had
a
sheen
as
of
crystal
like
a
city
cut
in
a
glacier
the
calm
and
sparkling
cold
brought
his
mind
back
to
the
realities
of
life
and
enabled
him
to
recognise
the
true
condition
of
his
mind
he
closed
the
window
and
sat
down
again
once
more
the
enigmatical
aspect
of
elena
character
occupied
him
questions
crowded
in
upon
him
tumultuously
persistently
but
he
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
them
to
attack
them
one
by
one
with
singular
lucidity
the
deeper
he
went
in
his
analysis
the
more
lucid
became
his
mental
vision
and
he
worked
out
his
psychological
revenge
with
cruel
relish
at
last
he
felt
that
he
had
laid
bare
a
soul
penetrated
a
mystery
it
seemed
to
him
that
thus
he
made
elena
infinitely
more
his
own
than
in
the
days
of
their
passion
what
after
all
was
this
woman
an
unbalanced
mind
in
a
sensually
inclined
body
as
with
all
who
are
greedy
of
pleasure
the
foundation
of
her
moral
being
was
overweening
egotism
her
dominant
faculty
her
intellectual
axis
so
to
speak
was
imagination
an
imagination
nourished
upon
a
wide
range
of
literature
connected
with
her
sex
and
perpetually
stimulated
by
neurotic
excitement
possessed
of
a
certain
degree
of
intellectual
capacity
brought
up
in
all
the
luxury
of
a
princely
roman
house
that
papal
luxury
which
is
made
up
of
art
and
history
she
had
received
a
thin
coating
of
æsthetic
varnish
had
acquired
a
graceful
taste
and
having
thoroughly
grasped
the
character
of
her
beauty
sought
by
skilful
simulation
and
a
sapient
use
of
her
marked
histrionic
talents
to
enhance
its
spirituality
by
surrounding
it
with
a
delusive
halo
of
ideality
into
the
comedy
of
human
life
she
thus
brought
some
highly
perilous
elements
and
was
thereby
the
occasion
of
more
ruin
and
disaster
than
if
she
had
been
a
by
profession
under
the
glamour
of
her
imagination
every
caprice
assumed
an
appearance
of
pathos
she
was
the
woman
of
fulminating
passions
of
suddenly
blazing
desire
she
covered
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
with
a
mantle
of
ethereal
flame
and
could
transform
into
a
noble
sentiment
what
was
merely
a
base
appetite
such
was
the
scathing
judgment
brought
by
andrea
against
the
woman
he
had
once
adored
at
the
root
of
every
action
every
expression
of
elena
love
he
now
discovered
studied
artifice
an
admirable
natural
gift
for
carrying
out
a
scheme
for
playing
a
dramatic
part
or
organising
a
striking
scene
he
did
not
spare
their
most
memorable
episodes
neither
the
first
meeting
at
the
ateletas
dinner
nor
the
cardinal
immenraet
sale
nor
the
ball
at
the
french
embassy
nor
the
sudden
offer
of
her
love
in
the
red
room
at
the
barberini
palace
nor
their
farewells
out
in
the
country
in
the
biting
march
blast
the
magic
draught
which
had
intoxicated
him
then
now
seemed
but
an
insidious
poison
yet
in
spite
of
it
all
certain
points
perplexed
him
as
if
in
penetrating
elena
soul
he
had
penetrated
his
own
and
in
the
perfidy
had
seen
a
reflection
of
his
own
there
was
much
affinity
between
their
two
natures
therefore
he
and
little
by
little
his
contempt
changed
to
ironical
indulgence
he
was
so
thoroughly
conversant
with
his
own
mode
of
procedure
then
with
cold
lucidity
he
mapped
out
his
plan
of
campaign
he
reviewed
every
detail
of
the
interview
that
had
taken
place
on
new
eve
more
than
a
week
ago
and
it
pleased
him
to
the
scene
but
without
the
slightest
indignation
or
excitement
only
smiling
cynically
both
at
elena
and
himself
why
had
she
come
simply
because
this
impromptu
with
a
former
lover
in
the
place
after
a
lapse
of
two
years
had
tempted
a
spirit
always
on
the
for
fresh
emotions
had
inflamed
her
imagination
and
her
curiosity
she
thirsted
to
see
into
what
new
situations
new
intrigues
the
dangerous
game
would
lead
her
she
was
perhaps
attracted
by
the
novelty
of
a
platonic
affection
with
a
person
who
had
already
been
the
object
of
her
sensual
passion
as
ever
she
had
thrown
herself
into
the
new
part
with
a
certain
imaginative
fervour
also
it
was
quite
possible
that
for
the
moment
she
believed
what
she
said
and
that
this
illusory
sincerity
had
furnished
her
with
that
deep
tenderness
of
accent
those
despairing
attitudes
those
tears
how
well
he
knew
it
all
she
had
a
sentimental
hallucination
as
other
people
have
a
physical
one
she
forgot
that
she
was
acting
a
lie
was
no
longer
conscious
whether
she
were
living
in
a
world
of
truth
or
falsehood
of
fiction
or
reality
now
this
was
precisely
the
moral
phenomenon
which
so
constantly
took
place
in
himself
therefore
he
could
not
reproach
her
without
injustice
but
the
discovery
very
naturally
deprived
him
of
the
hope
of
deriving
any
pleasure
from
her
other
than
sensual
ones
in
any
case
mistrust
would
poison
all
the
sweetness
of
abandon
all
soulful
rapture
to
deceive
a
confiding
and
faithful
heart
dominate
a
soul
by
artifice
possess
it
wholly
and
make
it
vibrate
like
an
instrument
non
all
this
doubtless
gives
intense
pleasure
but
to
deceive
and
know
that
one
is
being
deceived
in
return
is
a
stupid
and
fruitless
labour
a
tiresome
and
aimless
pursuit
he
must
therefore
work
upon
elena
to
renounce
the
sisterly
scheme
and
to
return
to
his
arms
once
more
he
must
regain
possession
of
this
beautiful
woman
extract
the
utmost
possible
pleasure
from
her
beauty
and
free
himself
for
ever
of
this
passion
by
reaching
the
point
of
satiety
but
it
was
a
task
demanding
prudence
and
patience
in
that
first
interview
his
ardour
had
availed
him
nothing
obviously
she
had
founded
her
plan
of
impeccability
on
the
grand
phrase
you
endure
to
share
me
with
another
the
mainspring
of
the
great
platonic
business
was
a
virtuous
horror
of
divided
possession
for
the
rest
it
was
just
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
this
horror
was
not
feigned
most
women
addicted
to
the
practice
of
free
love
if
they
do
eventually
marry
affect
during
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
a
savage
virtue
and
make
professions
of
conjugal
fidelity
with
the
most
honest
determination
perhaps
therefore
elena
had
been
affected
by
this
common
scruple
in
which
case
nothing
would
be
more
than
to
show
his
hand
too
boldly
and
offend
against
her
virtue
the
better
plan
would
be
to
second
her
spiritual
aspirations
accept
her
as
fondest
of
sisters
the
truest
of
friends
intoxicate
her
with
the
ideal
be
skilfully
platonic
and
then
make
her
glide
imperceptibly
from
frank
sisterly
relations
to
a
more
passionate
friendship
and
from
thence
to
the
complete
surrender
of
her
person
in
all
probability
these
transitions
would
occur
very
rapidly
it
all
depended
upon
a
wise
adjustment
of
circumstances
thus
andrea
sperelli
reasoned
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
which
had
glowed
upon
elena
laughing
among
the
scattered
rose
leaves
a
boundless
lassitude
weighed
upon
him
a
lassitude
which
did
not
invite
sleep
a
sense
of
weariness
so
empty
so
disconsolate
as
to
be
almost
a
longing
for
death
while
the
fire
died
out
on
the
hearth
and
the
tea
grew
cold
in
the
cup
chapter
iv
he
waited
in
vain
during
the
days
that
followed
for
the
promised
note
to
tell
him
when
he
might
see
elena
again
so
she
did
intend
to
make
another
appointment
with
him
the
question
was
where
at
the
casa
zuccari
again
would
she
risk
such
an
imprudence
a
second
time
this
uncertainty
kept
him
on
the
rack
he
passed
whole
hours
in
searching
for
some
way
of
meeting
her
of
seeing
her
again
he
went
several
times
to
the
hotel
quirinal
in
the
hope
of
being
received
but
never
once
did
he
find
her
at
home
one
evening
he
saw
her
again
in
the
theatre
with
as
she
called
her
husband
though
only
saying
the
usual
things
about
the
music
the
singers
the
ladies
he
infused
a
supplicating
melancholy
into
his
gaze
she
seemed
greatly
taken
up
by
the
arrangement
of
their
house
they
were
going
back
to
the
palazzo
barberini
her
old
quarters
but
were
having
them
much
enlarged
and
she
was
for
ever
occupied
with
upholsterers
and
decorators
giving
orders
and
superintending
the
placing
of
the
furniture
you
going
to
stay
long
in
rome
asked
andrea
she
answered
will
be
our
winter
residence
then
after
a
moment
pause
could
give
us
some
very
good
advice
about
the
furniture
come
to
the
palace
one
of
these
days
i
am
always
there
from
ten
to
twelve
he
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
lord
heathfield
was
talking
to
giulio
musellaro
who
had
just
entered
the
box
to
say
to
her
looking
her
full
in
the
eyes
all
means
she
replied
with
perfect
simplicity
as
if
she
had
not
noticed
the
tone
of
his
question
the
next
morning
about
eleven
he
set
off
on
foot
to
the
palazzo
barberini
through
the
via
sistina
it
was
a
road
he
had
often
traversed
before
and
for
a
moment
the
impressions
of
those
days
seemed
to
come
back
to
him
and
his
heart
swelled
the
fountain
of
bernini
shone
curiously
luminous
in
the
sunshine
as
if
the
dolphins
and
the
triton
with
his
had
by
some
interrupted
metamorphose
transformed
themselves
into
a
more
diaphanous
material
not
stone
nor
yet
quite
crystal
the
noise
of
the
building
of
new
rome
filled
all
the
piazza
and
the
adjoining
streets
country
children
ran
in
and
out
between
the
carts
and
horses
offering
violets
for
sale
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
and
entered
the
garden
he
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
tremble
i
love
her
still
he
thought
to
himself
she
still
the
woman
of
he
looked
at
the
great
palace
radiant
under
the
morning
sun
and
his
spirit
flew
back
to
the
days
when
in
certain
chill
and
misty
dawns
this
same
palace
had
assumed
for
him
a
look
of
enchantment
that
was
in
the
early
times
of
his
happiness
when
he
came
away
warm
from
her
kisses
and
full
of
his
bliss
the
bells
of
trinità
de
monti
of
san
isidoro
and
the
cappuccini
rang
out
the
angelus
into
the
dawning
day
with
a
muffled
peal
as
if
out
of
the
far
distance
at
the
corner
of
the
street
fires
glowed
red
round
cauldrons
of
boiling
asphalt
a
little
herd
of
goats
stood
against
the
white
wall
of
the
slumbering
house
these
forgotten
sensations
rose
up
once
more
out
of
the
depths
of
his
consciousness
and
for
an
instant
a
wave
of
the
old
love
swept
over
his
soul
for
one
moment
he
tried
to
imagine
that
elena
was
still
the
elena
of
those
days
that
his
happiness
had
endured
till
now
that
none
of
these
miserable
things
were
true
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
palace
all
this
illusory
ferment
died
away
on
the
instant
for
lord
heathfield
came
forward
to
greet
him
with
his
habitual
and
somewhat
ambiguous
smile
with
that
his
torture
began
elena
appeared
and
shaking
hands
cordially
with
him
in
her
presence
she
said
andrea
come
and
help
us
come
and
help
us
she
talked
and
gesticulated
with
much
vivacity
and
looked
very
girlish
in
a
jacket
of
cloth
trimmed
round
the
high
collar
and
the
cuffs
with
black
astrachan
and
fine
black
braiding
she
kept
one
hand
in
her
pocket
in
a
graceful
attitude
and
with
the
other
pointed
out
the
various
the
pictures
the
furniture
asking
his
advice
as
to
their
most
advantageous
disposal
would
you
put
these
two
chests
look
mumps
picked
them
up
at
lucca
these
pictures
are
your
beloved
where
would
you
hang
these
tapestries
andrea
recognised
the
four
pieces
of
tapestry
from
the
immenraet
sale
representing
the
story
of
narcissus
he
looked
at
elena
but
could
not
catch
her
eye
a
profound
sense
of
irritation
against
her
against
her
husband
against
all
these
things
took
possession
of
him
he
would
have
liked
to
go
away
but
politeness
demanded
that
he
should
place
his
good
taste
at
the
service
of
the
heathfields
it
also
obliged
him
to
submit
to
the
archæological
erudition
of
who
was
an
ardent
collector
and
was
anxious
to
show
him
some
of
his
finds
in
one
cabinet
andrea
caught
sight
of
the
pollajuolo
helmet
and
in
another
of
the
goblet
which
had
belonged
to
niccolo
niccoli
the
presence
of
that
particular
goblet
in
this
particular
place
moved
him
strangely
and
sent
a
flash
of
mad
suspicion
through
his
mind
so
it
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
lord
heathfield
the
famous
competition
between
the
countesses
having
come
to
nothing
nobody
troubled
themselves
further
about
the
fate
of
the
goblet
and
none
of
the
party
had
returned
to
the
sale
after
that
day
their
ephemeral
zeal
had
languished
and
finally
died
out
and
passed
away
like
everything
else
in
the
world
of
fashion
and
the
goblet
had
been
abandoned
to
the
competition
of
other
collectors
the
thing
was
perfectly
natural
but
at
that
moment
it
appeared
to
andrea
most
extraordinary
he
purposely
stopped
before
the
cabinet
and
gazed
long
at
the
precious
goblet
on
which
the
story
of
venus
and
anchises
glittered
as
if
cut
in
a
pure
diamond
niccoli
said
elena
pronouncing
the
name
with
an
indefinable
accent
in
which
the
young
man
seemed
to
catch
a
note
of
sadness
the
husband
had
just
gone
into
another
room
to
open
a
cabinet
remember
murmured
andrea
turning
towards
her
do
remember
when
may
i
see
you
when
you
promised
me
lord
heathfield
returned
they
passed
on
into
an
adjoining
room
making
the
tour
of
the
apartments
everywhere
they
met
workmen
hanging
papers
draping
curtains
carrying
furniture
each
time
elena
asked
his
opinion
andrea
had
to
make
an
effort
before
answering
her
in
order
to
disguise
his
and
his
impatience
at
last
he
managed
to
seize
a
moment
when
her
husband
was
occupied
with
one
of
the
men
to
say
to
her
in
a
low
voice
unable
any
longer
to
conceal
his
chagrin
inflict
this
torture
upon
me
i
expected
to
find
you
alone
passing
through
one
of
the
doors
elena
hat
caught
in
the
portière
and
was
dragged
out
of
place
she
laughed
and
called
to
mumps
to
come
and
unfasten
her
veil
and
andrea
was
forced
to
look
on
while
those
odious
hands
touched
the
hair
of
the
woman
he
desired
ruffling
the
little
curls
at
the
back
of
her
neck
those
curls
which
under
his
caresses
had
seemed
to
breathe
out
a
mysterious
perfume
unlike
any
other
and
sweeter
and
more
intoxicating
than
all
the
rest
he
hurriedly
took
his
leave
under
pretext
of
being
due
at
lunch
with
some
one
else
shall
move
in
here
on
the
of
february
elena
said
to
him
then
i
hope
you
will
be
one
of
our
andrea
bowed
he
would
have
given
worlds
not
to
be
obliged
to
touch
lord
hand
he
went
away
filled
with
rancour
jealousy
and
disgust
chapter
v
at
a
late
hour
that
same
evening
happening
to
look
in
at
the
club
where
he
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
whom
should
he
see
at
one
of
the
but
don
manuel
ferrès
y
capdevila
andrea
greeted
him
with
effusion
and
inquired
after
donna
maria
and
delfina
whether
they
were
still
at
sienna
when
they
were
coming
to
rome
don
manuel
who
remembered
to
have
won
several
thousand
lire
from
the
young
count
during
the
last
evening
at
schifanoja
and
had
recognised
in
andrea
sperelli
a
player
of
the
best
form
and
perfect
style
responded
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
cordiality
have
been
here
some
days
already
they
arrived
on
monday
he
answered
was
much
disappointed
not
to
find
the
marchesa
in
town
i
am
sure
it
would
give
her
the
greatest
pleasure
if
you
would
call
on
her
we
are
in
the
via
nazionale
here
is
the
exact
address
he
handed
one
of
his
cards
to
andrea
and
then
returned
to
the
game
the
duke
di
beffi
who
was
standing
with
a
knot
of
gentlemen
called
andrea
over
to
them
did
you
not
come
to
cento
celli
this
morning
asked
the
duke
had
another
appointment
andrea
replied
without
reflecting
the
palazzo
barberini
perhaps
said
the
duke
with
a
shy
laugh
in
which
he
was
joined
by
the
others
indeed
why
ludovico
saw
you
go
in
where
were
you
may
i
ask
said
andrea
turning
to
barbarisi
the
way
at
my
aunt
saviano
do
know
if
you
had
better
luck
than
we
had
beffi
went
on
we
had
a
run
of
minutes
and
got
two
foxes
the
next
meet
is
on
thursday
at
the
three
fountains
understand
at
the
fountains
not
at
the
gino
bomminaco
admonished
him
with
comic
gravity
the
others
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
which
andrea
could
not
help
joining
he
was
by
no
means
displeased
at
their
gibes
on
the
contrary
now
that
there
was
no
truth
in
their
suspicions
it
flattered
him
for
his
friends
to
think
he
had
renewed
his
relations
with
elena
he
turned
away
to
speak
to
giulio
musellaro
who
had
just
come
in
from
a
few
strays
words
that
reached
his
ear
he
found
that
the
group
behind
him
were
discussing
lord
heathfield
knew
him
in
london
six
or
seven
years
ago
beffi
was
saying
was
gentleman
of
the
to
the
prince
of
wales
as
far
as
i
remember
the
duke
lowered
his
voice
he
was
evidently
retailing
the
most
appalling
things
andrea
caught
scraps
here
and
there
of
a
nature
and
once
or
twice
the
name
of
a
newspaper
famous
in
the
annals
of
london
scandal
he
longed
to
hear
more
a
terrible
curiosity
took
possession
of
him
his
imagination
conjured
up
lord
heathfield
hands
before
him
so
white
so
significant
so
expressive
so
impossible
to
forget
musellaro
was
still
talking
and
now
said
us
go
i
want
to
tell
you
on
the
stairs
they
encountered
albonico
who
was
coming
up
he
was
in
deep
mourning
for
donna
ippolita
and
andrea
stopped
to
ask
for
details
of
the
sad
event
he
had
heard
of
her
death
when
he
was
in
paris
in
november
from
guido
montelatici
a
cousin
of
donna
ippolita
it
really
typhus
the
wan
and
widower
grasped
at
an
occasion
for
pouring
out
his
griefs
for
he
made
a
display
of
his
bereavement
as
at
one
time
he
had
made
a
display
of
his
wife
beauty
he
stammered
and
grew
lachrymose
and
his
colourless
eyes
seemed
bulging
from
his
head
seeing
that
the
widower
elegy
threatened
to
be
somewhat
long
drawn
out
musellaro
said
to
andrea
we
do
take
care
we
shall
be
late
andrea
accordingly
took
leave
of
albonico
promising
to
hear
the
rest
of
the
funeral
oration
very
shortly
and
went
away
with
musellaro
the
meeting
with
albonico
had
the
singular
emotion
partly
regret
partly
a
certain
peculiar
satisfaction
which
he
had
experienced
for
several
days
after
hearing
the
news
of
this
death
the
image
of
donna
ippolita
half
obliterated
by
his
illness
and
convalescence
by
his
love
for
maria
ferrès
by
a
variety
of
incidents
had
reappeared
to
him
then
as
in
the
dim
distance
but
invested
with
a
nameless
ideality
he
had
received
a
promise
from
her
which
though
it
was
never
fulfilled
had
procured
to
him
the
greatest
happiness
that
can
befall
a
man
the
victory
over
a
rival
a
brilliant
victory
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
desired
later
on
between
desire
and
regret
another
sentiment
grew
up
the
poetic
sentiment
for
beauty
idealised
by
death
it
pleased
him
that
the
adventure
should
end
thus
for
ever
this
woman
who
had
never
been
his
but
to
gain
whom
he
had
nearly
lost
his
life
now
rose
up
noble
and
unsullied
before
his
imagination
in
all
the
sublime
ideality
of
death
hippolyta
semper
where
are
we
going
to
asked
musellaro
stopping
short
in
the
middle
of
the
piazza
de
venezia
at
the
bottom
of
all
andrea
perturbation
and
all
his
varying
thoughts
was
the
excitement
called
up
in
him
by
his
meeting
with
don
manuel
ferrès
and
the
consequent
thought
of
donna
maria
and
now
in
the
midst
of
these
conflicting
emotions
a
sort
of
nervous
longing
drew
him
to
her
house
am
going
home
he
answered
can
go
through
the
via
nazionale
come
along
with
me
he
paid
no
heed
to
what
his
friend
was
saying
the
thought
of
maria
ferrès
occupied
him
exclusively
arrived
in
front
of
the
theatre
he
hesitated
a
moment
undecided
which
side
of
the
street
he
had
better
take
he
would
find
out
the
direction
of
the
house
by
seeing
which
way
the
numbers
ran
is
the
matter
asked
musellaro
go
on
i
am
listening
he
looked
at
one
number
and
calculated
that
the
house
must
be
on
the
left
hand
side
somewhere
about
the
villa
aldobrandini
the
tall
pines
round
the
villa
looked
feathery
light
against
the
starry
sky
the
night
was
icy
but
serene
the
torre
delle
milizie
lifted
up
its
massive
bulk
square
and
sombre
among
the
twinkling
stars
the
laurels
on
the
wall
of
servius
slumbered
motionless
in
the
gleam
of
the
street
lamps
a
few
numbers
more
and
they
would
reach
the
one
mentioned
on
don
manuel
card
andrea
trembled
as
if
he
expected
donna
maria
to
appear
upon
the
threshold
he
passed
so
close
to
the
great
door
that
he
brushed
against
it
he
could
not
refrain
from
looking
up
at
the
windows
are
you
looking
at
asked
musellaro
give
me
a
cigarette
and
let
us
walk
a
little
faster
it
is
awfully
cold
they
followed
the
via
nazionale
as
far
as
the
four
fountains
in
silence
andrea
preoccupation
was
patent
must
decidedly
have
something
serious
on
your
mind
said
his
friend
andrea
heart
beat
so
fast
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
pouring
his
confidences
into
his
friend
ear
but
he
restrained
himself
memories
of
schifanoja
passed
across
his
spirit
like
an
exhilarating
perfume
and
in
the
midst
of
them
beamed
the
figure
of
maria
ferrès
with
a
radiance
that
almost
dazzled
him
but
most
distinctly
and
more
luminously
than
all
the
rest
he
saw
that
moment
in
the
wood
at
vicomile
when
she
had
flung
those
burning
words
at
him
would
he
ever
hear
such
words
from
her
lips
again
what
had
she
been
doing
what
had
been
her
thoughts
how
had
she
spent
the
days
since
they
parted
his
agitation
increased
with
every
step
fragments
of
scenes
passed
rapidly
before
him
like
the
phantasmagoria
of
a
dream
a
bit
of
country
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
a
flight
of
steps
among
the
roses
the
interior
of
a
room
all
the
places
in
which
some
sentiment
had
had
its
birth
round
which
she
had
diffused
some
sweetness
where
she
had
breathed
the
charm
of
her
person
and
he
thrilled
with
profound
emotion
at
the
idea
that
perchance
she
still
carried
in
her
heart
that
living
passion
had
perhaps
suffered
and
wept
had
dreamed
and
hoped
said
musellaro
how
is
your
affair
with
donna
elena
progressing
they
happened
to
be
just
in
front
of
the
palazzo
barberini
behind
the
railings
and
the
great
stone
pillars
of
the
gates
stretched
the
garden
dimly
visible
through
the
gloom
animated
by
the
low
murmur
of
the
fountains
and
dominated
by
the
massive
white
palace
where
in
the
portico
alone
was
light
did
you
say
asked
andrea
asked
how
you
were
getting
on
with
donna
elena
andrea
glanced
up
at
the
palace
at
that
moment
he
seemed
to
feel
a
blank
indifference
in
his
heart
the
absolute
death
of
desire
the
final
renunciation
am
following
your
advice
i
have
not
tried
to
relight
the
cigarette
yet
do
you
know
in
this
one
instance
i
believe
it
would
be
worth
while
have
you
noticed
her
particularly
it
seems
to
me
that
she
has
become
more
beautiful
i
can
not
help
thinking
there
is
something
how
shall
i
express
it
something
new
something
indescribable
about
her
no
is
not
the
word
she
has
gained
intensity
without
losing
anything
of
the
peculiar
character
of
her
beauty
in
short
she
is
than
the
elena
of
two
years
ago
the
quintessence
of
herself
it
is
most
likely
the
effect
of
her
second
spring
for
i
should
fancy
she
must
be
hard
on
thirty
do
you
think
so
as
he
listened
andrea
felt
the
dull
ashes
of
his
love
stir
and
kindle
nothing
revives
and
excites
a
man
desire
so
much
as
hearing
from
another
the
praises
of
a
woman
he
has
loved
too
long
or
wooed
in
vain
a
love
in
its
may
thus
be
prolonged
as
the
result
of
the
envy
or
the
admiration
of
another
for
the
disgusted
or
wearied
lover
hesitates
to
abandon
what
he
possesses
or
is
struggling
to
possess
in
favour
of
a
possible
successor
you
think
so
musellaro
repeated
besides
to
make
a
menelaus
of
that
heathfield
would
in
itself
be
an
unspeakable
satisfaction
i
think
answered
andrea
forcing
himself
to
adopt
his
light
tone
we
shall
see
book
iv
chapter
i
grant
me
this
one
moment
of
unalloyed
sweetness
let
me
tell
you
all
that
is
in
my
heart
she
rose
me
she
said
gently
without
anger
or
bitterness
and
with
an
audible
quiver
of
emotion
in
her
voice
me
but
i
can
not
listen
to
you
you
pain
me
very
much
i
will
not
say
anything
only
stay
i
implore
you
she
seated
herself
once
more
it
was
like
the
days
of
schifanoja
come
back
again
the
same
matchless
grace
of
the
delicate
head
drooping
under
the
masses
of
hair
as
under
some
divine
chastisement
the
same
deep
and
tender
shadow
a
fusion
of
diaphanous
violet
and
soft
blue
surrounding
the
tawny
brown
eyes
only
wanted
andrea
went
on
humbly
only
wanted
to
remind
you
of
the
words
i
spoke
the
words
you
listened
to
that
morning
in
the
park
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
in
an
hour
that
will
always
remain
sacred
in
my
memory
have
not
forgotten
them
that
day
my
unhappiness
has
become
ever
deeper
darker
more
poignant
i
can
never
tell
you
all
i
have
suffered
all
the
abject
misery
of
that
time
can
never
tell
you
how
often
in
spirit
i
have
called
upon
you
as
if
my
last
hour
had
come
nor
describe
to
you
the
thrill
of
joy
the
upward
bound
of
my
whole
soul
towards
the
light
of
hope
if
for
one
moment
i
dared
to
think
that
the
remembrance
of
me
still
lived
in
your
heart
he
spoke
in
the
accents
of
that
morning
long
ago
he
seemed
to
have
regained
the
same
passionate
rapture
all
his
vaguely
felt
happiness
rose
to
his
lips
and
she
sat
motionless
listening
with
drooping
head
almost
in
the
same
attitude
as
on
that
day
and
round
her
lips
those
lips
which
she
vainly
sought
to
keep
firm
there
played
the
same
expression
of
dolorous
rapture
you
remember
vicomile
do
you
remember
our
ride
through
the
wood
on
that
evening
in
october
donna
maria
bent
her
head
slightly
in
sign
of
assent
the
words
you
said
to
me
the
young
man
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
but
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
passion
and
bending
down
to
look
into
the
eyes
she
kept
steadfastly
fixed
upon
the
ground
she
raised
them
now
to
his
those
sweet
patient
pathetic
eyes
have
forgotten
nothing
she
replied
nothing
why
should
i
hide
my
heart
from
you
you
are
good
and
and
i
have
absolute
trust
in
your
generosity
why
should
i
act
towards
you
like
an
ordinary
foolish
woman
i
told
you
that
evening
that
i
loved
you
your
question
implies
another
one
i
see
that
very
well
you
want
to
ask
me
if
i
love
you
still
she
faltered
for
a
moment
and
her
lips
quivered
love
you
you
must
give
up
all
claim
upon
my
love
you
must
keep
away
from
me
be
noble
be
generous
and
spare
me
the
struggle
which
frightens
me
i
have
suffered
much
andrea
i
have
borne
much
but
the
thought
of
having
to
struggle
with
you
to
defend
myself
against
you
fills
me
with
a
nameless
terror
you
do
not
know
at
the
cost
of
what
sacrifices
i
have
at
last
gained
peace
of
heart
you
do
not
know
what
lofty
and
cherished
ideals
i
have
been
obliged
to
bid
farewell
to
poor
ideals
i
am
a
changed
woman
because
i
could
not
help
it
i
have
had
to
place
myself
on
a
lower
level
there
was
a
note
of
grave
sweet
sadness
in
her
voice
those
first
days
after
i
met
you
i
abandoned
myself
to
the
alluring
sweetness
let
myself
drift
with
eyes
closed
to
the
distant
peril
i
thought
he
shall
never
know
anything
from
me
i
shall
never
know
anything
from
him
i
had
nothing
to
regret
and
therefore
i
felt
no
fear
but
you
spoke
you
said
things
to
me
that
no
one
had
ever
said
before
and
then
you
forced
my
avowal
from
me
the
danger
suddenly
appeared
before
me
unmistakable
imminent
and
then
i
abandoned
myself
to
a
fresh
dream
your
mental
distress
touched
me
to
the
heart
caused
me
profound
pain
impurity
has
sullied
his
soul
i
thought
to
myself
oh
that
i
had
the
power
to
purify
it
again
what
happiness
to
offer
myself
up
as
a
sacrifice
for
his
regeneration
your
unhappiness
attracted
mine
i
thought
i
might
scarcely
be
able
to
console
you
but
i
hoped
at
least
you
might
find
relief
in
having
another
soul
to
answer
eternally
to
all
your
plaints
she
uttered
the
last
words
with
a
face
so
suffused
with
spiritual
exaltation
that
andrea
felt
a
wave
of
joy
sweep
over
him
and
his
one
desire
at
that
moment
was
to
take
those
dear
and
spotless
hands
in
his
and
breathe
upon
them
the
ineffable
rapture
of
his
soul
it
can
not
it
may
not
be
she
went
on
shaking
her
head
in
sad
regret
must
renounce
that
hope
for
ever
life
is
inexorable
without
intending
it
you
would
destroy
a
whole
existence
and
more
than
one
perhaps
maria
do
not
say
such
things
the
young
man
broke
in
leaning
over
her
once
more
and
taking
one
of
her
hands
with
a
sort
of
timid
entreaty
as
if
looking
for
some
sign
of
permission
before
venturing
on
the
liberty
will
do
anything
you
tell
me
i
will
be
humble
and
obedient
my
one
thought
shall
be
to
carry
out
your
wishes
my
one
desire
to
die
with
your
name
upon
my
lips
in
renouncing
you
i
renounce
my
salvation
i
fall
back
into
irremediable
ruin
and
disaster
i
have
no
words
to
express
my
love
for
you
i
have
need
of
you
you
alone
are
you
are
truth
itself
for
which
my
soul
is
ever
seeking
all
else
is
vanity
all
else
is
nought
to
give
you
up
is
like
signing
my
but
if
this
immolation
is
necessary
to
your
peace
of
mind
it
shall
be
done
i
owe
it
to
you
do
not
fear
maria
i
will
never
do
anything
to
hurt
you
he
held
her
hand
but
he
did
not
press
it
his
voice
had
none
of
the
old
passionate
ardour
it
was
submissive
disconsolate
full
of
infinite
weariness
and
maria
was
so
blinded
by
her
compassion
that
she
did
not
draw
away
her
hand
but
let
it
lie
in
his
abandoning
herself
for
a
moment
to
the
unutterable
rapture
of
that
light
contact
a
rapture
so
subtle
as
hardly
to
have
any
physical
origin
as
if
some
magnetic
fluid
issuing
from
her
heart
diffused
itself
through
her
arm
to
her
fingers
and
there
flowed
forth
in
a
wave
of
ineffable
sweetness
when
andrea
ceased
speaking
certain
words
of
his
uttered
on
that
memorable
morning
in
the
park
and
revived
by
the
recent
sound
of
his
voice
returned
to
her
memory
mere
presence
suffices
to
intoxicate
me
i
feel
it
flowing
through
my
veins
like
blood
flooding
my
soul
with
nameless
emotion
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
from
time
to
time
a
gust
of
wind
shook
the
and
bore
fitfully
with
it
the
distant
roar
of
the
city
and
the
rumbling
of
carriage
wheels
the
light
was
cold
and
limpid
as
spring
water
shadows
were
gathering
thickly
in
the
corners
of
the
room
and
in
the
folds
of
the
oriental
curtains
from
pieces
of
furniture
here
and
there
came
gleams
of
ivory
and
a
great
gilded
buddha
shone
out
of
the
background
under
a
tall
palm
something
of
the
exotic
mystery
of
these
things
was
diffused
over
the
what
do
you
suppose
is
going
to
become
of
me
now
asked
andrea
she
seemed
lost
in
perplexing
thought
there
was
a
look
of
irresolution
on
her
face
as
if
she
were
listening
to
two
contending
voices
can
not
describe
to
you
she
answered
passing
her
hand
over
her
eyes
with
a
rapid
gesture
can
not
describe
to
you
the
strange
foreboding
that
has
weighed
upon
me
for
a
long
time
past
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
but
i
am
then
after
a
pause
to
think
that
you
may
be
suffering
sick
at
heart
my
poor
darling
and
that
i
can
do
nothing
to
ease
your
pain
may
not
be
with
you
in
your
hour
of
anguish
may
not
even
know
that
you
have
called
me
dio
there
was
a
quiver
of
tears
in
her
breaking
voice
andrea
hung
his
head
but
did
not
speak
think
that
my
spirit
will
follow
you
always
always
and
yet
that
it
may
never
never
mingle
with
yours
will
never
never
be
understood
by
you
alas
poor
love
her
voice
was
full
of
tears
and
her
mouth
was
drawn
with
pain
ah
do
not
desert
me
do
not
desert
me
cried
the
young
man
seizing
her
two
hands
and
at
her
feet
a
prey
to
overwhelming
excitement
will
never
ask
anything
of
you
i
want
nothing
but
your
pity
a
little
pity
from
you
is
more
far
more
to
me
than
passionate
love
from
any
other
woman
you
know
it
your
hand
alone
can
heal
me
can
bring
me
back
to
life
can
raise
me
out
of
the
slough
into
which
i
have
sunk
give
me
back
my
faith
and
free
me
from
the
bondage
of
those
shameful
things
that
corrupt
me
and
fill
me
with
horror
dear
dear
hands
he
bent
over
them
and
pressed
his
lips
to
them
in
a
long
kiss
abandoning
himself
with
eyes
to
the
utter
sweetness
of
it
can
feel
you
tremble
he
murmured
in
an
indefinable
tone
she
rose
abruptly
trembling
from
head
to
foot
giddy
paler
still
than
on
the
morning
when
they
walked
together
beneath
the
trees
the
wind
still
shook
the
panes
there
was
a
dull
clamour
in
the
distance
as
of
a
riotous
crowd
the
shrill
cries
borne
on
the
wind
from
the
quirinal
increased
her
agitation
andrea
please
go
you
must
not
stay
here
any
longer
you
shall
see
me
some
other
time
whenever
you
like
but
go
now
i
entreat
you
shall
i
see
you
again
the
concert
she
was
as
perturbed
and
agitated
as
if
she
had
been
guilty
of
some
grave
fault
she
accompanied
him
to
the
door
of
the
room
when
she
found
herself
alone
she
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
still
under
the
sway
of
her
terror
her
temples
throbbed
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
burned
with
fierce
intensity
while
cold
shivers
ran
through
her
limbs
but
on
her
hands
she
still
felt
the
pressure
of
that
beloved
mouth
a
sensation
so
surpassingly
sweet
that
she
wished
it
might
remain
there
for
ever
indelible
like
some
divine
impress
she
looked
about
her
the
light
was
fading
things
looked
shapeless
in
the
shadows
the
great
buddha
gleamed
with
a
weird
pale
light
the
cries
came
up
from
the
street
fitfully
she
went
over
to
a
window
opened
it
and
leaned
out
an
icy
wind
blew
through
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
piazza
dei
termini
they
were
already
lighting
the
lamps
across
the
way
at
the
villa
aldobrandini
the
trees
swayed
to
and
fro
their
tops
touched
with
a
faint
red
glow
a
huge
crimson
cloud
hung
solitary
in
the
sky
over
the
torre
delle
milizie
the
evening
struck
her
as
strangely
lugubrious
she
withdrew
from
the
window
and
seated
herself
again
where
she
had
just
had
her
conversation
with
andrea
why
had
delfina
not
returned
yet
she
earnestly
desired
to
escape
from
her
thoughts
and
yet
she
weakly
allowed
herself
to
linger
in
the
place
where
only
a
few
minutes
ago
andrea
had
breathed
and
spoken
had
sighed
out
his
love
and
his
unhappiness
the
struggles
the
resolutions
the
contrition
the
prayers
the
penances
of
four
months
had
been
wiped
out
made
utterly
unavailing
in
one
second
of
time
and
she
sank
down
more
weary
and
vanquished
than
ever
without
the
will
or
the
power
to
fight
against
the
foes
that
beset
her
in
her
own
heart
against
the
feelings
that
were
upheaving
her
whole
moral
foundations
and
while
she
gave
way
to
the
anguish
and
despair
of
a
conscience
which
feels
all
its
courage
oozing
from
it
she
still
had
the
feeling
that
something
of
lingered
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
and
enveloped
her
with
all
the
sweetness
of
a
passionate
caress
chapter
ii
the
next
day
she
arrived
at
the
palazzo
dei
sabini
her
heart
beating
fast
under
a
bunch
of
violets
andrea
was
looking
out
for
her
at
the
door
of
the
he
said
and
pressed
her
hand
he
conducted
her
to
a
seat
and
sat
down
beside
her
thought
the
anxiety
of
waiting
for
you
would
have
killed
me
he
murmured
was
so
afraid
you
would
not
come
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
late
last
night
he
went
on
passed
your
house
there
was
a
light
in
one
window
the
third
looking
towards
the
quirinal
i
would
have
given
much
to
know
if
you
were
up
there
who
gave
you
those
violets
he
asked
abruptly
she
answered
delfina
tell
you
of
our
meeting
this
morning
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
all
the
concert
began
with
a
quartett
by
mendelssohn
the
hall
was
already
nearly
full
the
audience
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
foreign
ladies
women
very
quietly
and
simply
dressed
grave
of
attitude
religiously
silent
as
in
some
sacred
spot
the
wave
of
music
passing
over
these
motionless
heads
spread
out
into
the
golden
light
a
light
that
filtered
from
above
through
faded
yellow
curtains
and
was
reflected
from
the
bare
white
walls
it
was
the
old
hall
of
the
philharmonic
concerts
the
whiteness
of
the
walls
was
unbroken
by
any
ornament
with
only
here
and
there
a
trace
of
former
frescoes
and
its
meagre
blue
portières
threatening
to
come
down
at
any
moment
it
had
all
the
air
of
a
place
that
had
been
closed
for
a
century
and
opened
again
that
day
for
the
first
time
but
just
this
faded
look
of
age
the
air
of
poverty
the
nakedness
of
the
walls
lent
a
curious
additional
flavour
to
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
the
audience
making
their
delight
seem
more
absorbing
loftier
purer
by
contrast
it
was
the
of
february
at
montecitorio
the
parliament
was
disputing
over
the
massacre
of
dogali
the
neighbouring
streets
and
squares
swarmed
with
the
populace
and
with
soldiers
musical
memories
of
schifanoja
came
back
to
the
lovers
a
reflected
gleam
from
those
fair
autumn
days
illumined
their
thoughts
mendelssohn
minuet
called
up
before
them
a
vision
of
the
villa
by
the
sea
of
rooms
filled
with
the
perfume
of
the
terraced
garden
of
cypresses
lifting
their
dark
heads
into
the
soft
sky
of
flaming
sails
upon
a
glassy
sea
bending
towards
his
companion
andrea
whispered
softly
are
you
thinking
about
with
a
smile
so
faint
that
he
hardly
caught
it
she
answered
you
remember
the
of
september
andrea
had
no
very
clear
recollection
of
this
date
but
he
nodded
his
head
the
andante
calm
broad
and
solemn
dominated
by
a
wonderful
and
pathetic
melody
had
ended
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
grief
the
finale
lingered
in
a
certain
rhythmic
monotony
full
of
plaintive
weariness
comes
your
favourite
bach
said
donna
maria
and
when
the
music
commenced
they
both
felt
an
instinctive
desire
to
draw
closer
to
each
other
their
shoulders
touched
at
the
end
of
each
part
andrea
leant
over
her
to
read
the
programme
which
she
held
open
in
her
hands
and
in
so
doing
pressed
against
her
arm
inhaling
the
perfume
of
her
violets
and
sending
a
wild
thrill
of
ecstasy
through
her
the
adagio
rose
with
so
exultant
a
song
soared
with
so
jubilant
a
strain
to
the
topmost
summits
of
rapture
and
flowed
wide
into
the
infinite
that
it
seemed
like
the
voice
of
some
celestial
being
pouring
out
the
joy
of
a
deathless
victory
the
spirits
of
the
audience
were
borne
along
on
that
irresistible
torrent
of
sound
when
the
music
ceased
the
tremor
of
the
instruments
continued
for
a
moment
in
the
hearers
a
murmur
ran
from
one
end
of
the
hall
to
the
other
a
moment
later
and
the
applause
broke
forth
vehemently
the
lovers
turned
simultaneously
and
looked
at
one
another
with
swimming
eyes
the
music
continued
the
light
began
to
fade
a
gentle
warmth
pervaded
the
air
and
donna
maria
violets
breathed
a
fuller
fragrance
seeing
nobody
near
him
whom
he
knew
andrea
almost
felt
as
if
he
were
alone
with
her
but
he
was
mistaken
turning
round
in
one
of
the
pauses
he
caught
sight
of
elena
standing
at
the
back
of
the
hall
with
the
princess
of
ferentino
instantly
their
eyes
met
as
he
bowed
to
her
he
seemed
to
catch
a
singular
smile
on
elena
lips
whom
are
you
bowing
asked
donna
maria
turning
round
too
are
those
ladies
heathfield
and
the
princess
of
ferentino
she
noticed
a
tremor
of
annoyance
in
his
voice
of
them
is
the
princess
of
ferentino
fair
one
other
is
very
beautiful
andrea
said
nothing
is
she
english
she
asked
again
she
is
a
roman
she
was
the
widow
of
the
duke
of
scerni
and
now
married
again
to
lord
heathfield
is
very
lovely
is
coming
next
andrea
asked
hurriedly
brahms
quartett
in
c
minor
you
know
it
second
movement
is
marvellous
he
went
on
speaking
to
hide
his
embarrassment
shall
i
see
you
again
he
asked
do
not
know
she
hesitated
a
cloud
seemed
to
have
come
over
her
face
she
answered
it
is
fine
i
shall
take
delfina
to
the
piazza
di
spagna
about
twelve
if
it
is
not
fine
saturday
evening
i
shall
be
at
the
countess
starnina
the
music
began
once
more
the
first
movement
expressed
a
sombre
and
virile
struggle
the
romance
a
memory
full
of
passionate
but
sad
desire
followed
by
a
slow
uplifting
faltering
and
tentative
towards
the
distant
dawn
out
of
this
a
clear
and
melodious
phrase
developed
itself
with
splendid
modulations
the
sentiment
was
very
different
from
that
which
animated
bach
adagio
it
was
more
human
more
earthly
more
elegiacal
a
breath
of
beethoven
ran
through
this
music
andrea
nervous
perturbation
was
so
great
that
he
feared
every
moment
to
betray
himself
all
his
pleasure
was
embittered
he
could
not
exactly
analyse
his
discomfort
he
could
neither
gather
himself
together
and
overcome
it
nor
put
it
away
from
him
he
was
swayed
in
turn
by
the
charm
of
the
music
and
the
fascination
exercised
over
him
by
each
of
these
women
without
being
really
dominated
by
any
of
the
three
he
had
a
vague
sensation
as
of
some
empty
space
in
which
heavy
blows
perpetually
resounded
followed
by
dolorous
echoes
his
thoughts
seemed
to
break
up
and
crumble
away
into
a
thousand
fragments
and
the
images
of
the
two
women
to
melt
into
and
destroy
one
another
without
his
being
able
to
disconnect
them
or
to
separate
his
feeling
for
the
one
from
his
feeling
for
the
other
and
above
all
this
mental
disturbance
was
the
anxiety
occasioned
by
the
immediate
circumstances
by
the
necessity
for
adopting
some
practical
line
of
action
donna
maria
slight
change
of
attitude
had
not
escaped
him
and
he
seemed
to
feel
elena
gaze
riveted
upon
him
what
course
should
he
pursue
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
accompany
donna
maria
when
she
left
the
concert
or
to
approach
elena
nor
could
he
determine
where
this
incident
would
be
favourable
to
him
or
otherwise
with
either
of
the
ladies
am
going
said
donna
maria
rising
at
the
end
of
the
movement
will
not
wait
till
the
end
i
must
be
home
by
five
not
forget
morning
she
held
out
her
hand
it
was
perhaps
the
air
of
the
close
room
that
sent
a
flush
to
her
pale
cheek
a
velvet
mantle
of
a
dull
leaden
shade
with
a
deep
border
of
chinchilla
covered
her
to
her
feet
and
amid
the
soft
gray
fur
the
violets
were
dying
exquisitely
as
she
passed
out
she
moved
with
such
a
queenly
grace
that
many
of
the
ladies
turned
to
follow
her
with
their
eyes
it
was
the
first
time
that
in
this
spiritual
creature
the
pure
siennese
madonna
andrea
also
beheld
the
elegant
woman
of
the
world
the
third
movement
of
the
quartett
began
the
daylight
had
diminished
so
much
that
the
yellow
curtains
had
to
be
drawn
back
several
other
ladies
left
a
low
hum
of
conversation
was
audible
here
and
there
the
fatigue
and
inattention
which
invariably
marks
the
end
of
a
concert
began
to
make
itself
apparent
in
the
audience
by
one
of
those
strange
and
abrupt
manifestations
of
moral
elasticity
andrea
experienced
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
not
to
say
gaiety
in
a
moment
he
had
forgotten
his
sentimental
and
passionate
and
all
that
now
appealed
to
him
to
his
vanity
to
his
corrupt
senses
was
the
licentious
aspect
of
the
affair
he
thought
to
himself
that
in
granting
him
these
little
innocent
rendezvous
donna
maria
had
already
set
her
foot
on
the
gentle
downward
slope
of
the
path
at
the
bottom
of
which
lies
sin
inevitable
even
to
the
most
vigilant
soul
he
also
argued
that
doubtless
a
little
touch
of
jealousy
would
do
much
towards
bringing
elena
back
to
his
arms
and
that
thus
the
one
intrigue
would
help
on
the
other
was
it
not
a
vague
fear
a
jealous
foreboding
that
had
made
donna
maria
consent
so
quickly
to
their
next
meeting
he
saw
himself
therefore
well
on
the
way
to
a
conquest
and
he
could
not
repress
a
smile
as
he
reflected
that
in
both
adventures
the
chief
difficulty
presented
itself
under
the
same
guise
both
women
professed
a
wish
to
play
the
part
of
sister
to
him
it
was
for
him
to
transform
these
sisters
in
something
closer
he
remarked
upon
other
resemblances
between
the
two
that
voice
how
curiously
like
elena
were
some
tones
in
donna
maria
voice
a
mad
thought
flashed
through
his
brain
that
voice
might
furnish
him
with
the
elements
of
a
study
of
imagination
by
virtue
of
that
affinity
he
might
resolve
the
two
fair
women
into
one
and
thus
possess
a
third
imaginary
mistress
more
complex
more
perfect
more
because
she
would
be
ideal
the
third
movement
executed
in
faultless
style
finished
in
a
burst
of
applause
andrea
rose
and
approached
elena
there
you
are
ugenta
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
exclaimed
the
princess
the
pays
du
tendre
your
incognita
asked
elena
lightly
as
she
pulled
a
bunch
of
violets
out
of
her
muff
and
sniffed
them
is
a
great
friend
of
my
cousin
francesca
donna
maria
ferrès
y
capdevila
the
wife
of
the
new
minister
for
guatemala
andrea
replied
without
turning
a
hair
beautiful
creature
and
very
cultivated
she
was
at
schifanoja
with
francesca
last
september
what
of
francesca
elena
broke
in
you
know
when
she
is
coming
back
had
the
latest
news
from
her
a
day
or
two
ago
from
san
remo
fernandino
is
better
but
i
am
afraid
she
will
have
to
stay
on
there
another
month
at
least
perhaps
longer
a
pity
the
last
movement
a
very
short
one
began
elena
and
the
princess
occupied
two
chairs
at
the
end
of
the
room
against
the
wall
under
a
dim
mirror
in
which
the
melancholy
hall
was
reflected
elena
listened
with
bent
head
slowly
drawing
through
her
fingers
the
long
ends
of
her
boa
the
concert
over
she
said
to
sperelli
you
see
us
to
the
carriage
as
she
entered
her
carriage
after
the
princess
she
turned
to
him
again
you
come
too
we
will
drop
eva
at
the
palazzo
fiano
and
i
can
put
you
down
wherever
you
like
answered
andrea
nothing
loath
on
the
corso
they
were
obliged
to
proceed
very
slowly
the
whole
roadway
being
taken
up
by
a
seething
tumultuous
crowd
from
the
piazza
di
montecitorio
and
the
piazza
colonna
came
a
perfect
uproar
that
swelled
and
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
mingled
with
shrill
the
tumult
increased
as
the
gray
cold
twilight
deepened
horror
at
the
tragedy
enacted
in
a
land
made
the
populace
howl
with
rage
men
broke
through
the
dense
crowd
running
and
waving
great
bundles
of
newspapers
through
all
the
clamour
the
one
word
africa
rang
distinctly
all
this
for
four
hundred
brutes
who
had
died
the
death
of
brutes
murmured
andrea
withdrawing
his
head
from
the
carriage
window
are
you
saying
cried
the
princess
at
the
corner
of
the
chigi
palace
the
commotion
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
riot
the
carriage
had
to
stop
elena
leaned
forward
to
look
out
and
her
face
emerging
from
the
shadows
and
lighted
up
by
the
glare
of
the
gas
and
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
seemed
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
an
almost
icy
pallor
reminding
andrea
of
some
head
he
had
seen
before
he
could
not
say
where
or
when
in
some
gallery
or
chapel
we
are
said
the
princess
as
the
carriage
drew
up
at
last
at
the
palazzo
fiano
we
shall
meet
again
at
the
angelieris
this
evening
ugenta
will
come
and
lunch
with
us
you
will
find
elena
and
barbarella
viti
and
my
cousin
there
what
time
twelve
i
will
the
princess
got
out
the
footman
stood
at
the
carriage
door
awaiting
further
orders
shall
i
take
you
elena
asked
sperelli
who
had
promptly
taken
the
place
of
the
princess
beside
her
far
away
tell
me
now
home
and
without
waiting
for
his
answer
she
said
the
palazzo
zuccari
trinità
de
monti
the
footman
closed
the
carriage
door
and
they
drove
off
down
the
via
frattina
leaving
all
the
turmoil
of
the
crowd
behind
them
elena
after
so
long
andrea
burst
out
leaning
down
to
gaze
at
the
woman
he
so
passionately
desired
and
who
had
shrunk
away
from
him
into
the
shadow
as
if
to
avoid
his
contact
the
brilliant
lights
of
the
shop
windows
pierced
the
gloom
in
the
carriage
as
they
passed
and
he
saw
on
elena
white
face
a
slow
alluring
smile
still
smiling
thus
with
a
rapid
movement
she
unwound
the
boa
from
her
neck
and
cast
it
over
andrea
head
like
a
lasso
and
with
that
soft
loop
all
fragrant
with
the
same
perfume
he
had
noticed
in
the
blue
fox
of
her
coat
she
drew
the
young
man
towards
her
and
silently
held
up
her
lips
to
his
well
did
those
two
pairs
of
lips
remember
the
rapture
of
days
those
terrible
and
yet
deliriously
sweet
meetings
prolonged
to
anguish
they
held
their
breath
to
taste
the
sweetness
of
that
kiss
to
the
full
passing
through
the
via
due
macelli
the
carriage
drove
up
the
via
dei
tritone
turned
into
the
via
sistina
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
palazzo
zuccari
elena
instantly
released
her
captive
saying
rather
huskily
now
will
you
come
sa
the
footman
opened
the
door
and
andrea
got
out
the
carriage
turned
back
to
the
via
sistina
and
andrea
still
vibrating
with
passion
a
veil
of
mist
before
his
eyes
stood
watching
to
see
if
elena
face
would
not
appear
at
the
window
but
he
saw
nothing
the
carriage
drove
rapidly
away
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
to
his
apartment
he
said
to
himself
she
has
come
round
at
last
the
intoxication
of
her
presence
was
still
upon
him
on
his
lips
he
still
felt
the
pressure
of
her
kiss
and
in
his
eyes
was
the
flash
of
the
smile
with
which
she
had
thrown
that
sort
of
smooth
and
perfumed
snake
about
his
neck
and
donna
maria
most
assuredly
it
was
to
her
he
owed
these
unexpected
favours
there
was
no
doubt
that
at
the
bottom
of
elena
strange
and
fantastic
behaviour
lay
a
decided
touch
of
jealousy
fearing
perhaps
that
he
was
escaping
her
she
sought
thus
to
lure
him
back
and
rekindle
his
passion
she
love
me
or
does
she
not
but
what
did
it
matter
to
him
one
way
or
another
what
good
would
it
do
him
to
know
the
spell
was
broken
irremediably
no
miracle
that
ever
was
wrought
could
revive
the
least
little
atom
of
the
love
that
was
dead
the
only
thing
that
need
occupy
him
now
was
the
carnal
body
and
that
was
divine
as
ever
he
indulged
long
in
pleasurable
meditation
on
this
episode
what
particularly
took
his
fancy
was
the
arch
and
graceful
touch
elena
had
given
to
her
caprice
the
thought
of
the
boa
evoked
the
image
of
donna
maria
coils
and
so
confusedly
all
the
amorous
fancies
he
had
woven
round
that
virginal
mass
of
hair
by
which
once
on
a
time
the
very
of
the
florentine
convent
had
been
enthralled
and
again
he
let
his
two
loves
melt
into
one
and
form
the
third
the
ideal
the
musing
mood
still
upon
him
while
he
dressed
for
dinner
he
thought
to
himself
a
grand
scene
of
passion
almost
ending
in
tears
a
little
episode
of
mute
sensuality
and
i
seemed
to
myself
as
sincere
in
my
sentiment
yesterday
as
i
was
in
my
sensations
added
to
which
scarcely
an
hour
before
elena
kiss
i
had
a
moment
of
lofty
lyrical
emotion
at
donna
maria
side
of
all
this
not
one
vestige
remains
most
assuredly
i
shall
begin
the
same
game
over
again
i
am
unstable
as
water
incoherent
inconsistent
a
very
chameleon
all
my
efforts
towards
unity
of
purpose
are
for
ever
vain
i
must
resign
myself
to
my
fate
the
law
of
my
being
is
comprised
in
the
one
word
the
will
of
the
law
be
done
he
laughed
at
himself
and
from
that
moment
began
a
new
phase
of
his
moral
degradation
without
mercy
without
remorse
without
restraint
he
set
all
his
faculties
to
work
to
compass
the
realisation
of
his
impure
imaginings
to
vanquish
maria
ferrès
he
had
recourse
to
the
most
subtle
artifices
the
most
delicate
machinations
taking
care
to
deceive
her
in
matters
of
the
soul
of
the
spiritual
the
ideal
the
inmost
life
of
the
heart
in
carrying
on
the
two
campaigns
the
conquest
of
the
new
and
the
of
the
old
love
with
equal
adroitness
and
in
turning
to
the
best
advantage
the
chance
circumstances
of
each
enterprise
he
was
led
into
an
infinity
of
annoying
embarrassing
and
ridiculous
situations
to
extricate
himself
from
which
he
was
obliged
to
descend
to
a
series
of
lies
and
deceptions
of
paltry
evasions
ignoble
subterfuges
and
equivocal
expedients
all
donna
maria
goodness
and
faith
and
single
mindedness
were
powerless
to
disarm
him
as
the
foundation
of
his
work
of
seduction
with
her
he
had
taken
a
verse
from
one
of
the
psalms
me
hyssopo
et
mundabor
lavabis
me
et
super
nirem
and
she
poor
hapless
devoted
creature
imagined
that
she
was
saving
a
soul
alive
redeeming
an
intellect
washing
away
by
her
own
purity
the
stains
that
sin
had
left
on
him
she
still
believed
implicitly
in
the
words
he
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
park
on
that
epiphany
of
love
within
sight
of
the
sea
and
it
was
just
in
this
belief
that
she
found
comfort
and
support
in
the
midst
of
the
religious
conflict
that
rent
her
conscience
this
belief
that
blinded
her
to
all
suspicion
and
filled
her
with
a
soil
of
mystic
intoxication
wherein
she
opened
the
secret
floodgates
of
her
heart
and
let
loose
all
her
tenderness
and
let
the
sweetest
flowers
of
her
womanhood
blossom
out
resplendently
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
andrea
sperelli
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
passion
one
of
those
rare
and
supreme
manifestations
of
woman
capacity
for
love
which
occasionally
flash
their
superb
and
terrible
lightnings
across
the
shifting
gray
sky
of
earthly
loves
but
he
did
not
care
a
jot
and
went
on
with
the
pitiless
work
which
was
to
destroy
both
himself
and
his
victim
chapter
iii
the
next
day
according
to
their
agreement
at
the
concert
andrea
found
donna
maria
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
with
delfina
looking
at
the
antique
jewellery
in
a
shop
window
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
she
turned
and
a
bright
flush
stained
the
pallor
of
her
cheek
together
they
then
examined
the
jewels
the
paste
buckles
and
hair
ornaments
the
enamelled
watches
the
gold
and
ivory
all
these
pretty
trifles
of
a
day
which
afforded
an
impression
of
harmonious
richness
under
the
clear
morning
sun
everywhere
about
them
the
were
offering
yellow
and
white
jonquils
double
violets
and
long
branches
of
flowering
almond
there
was
a
breath
of
spring
in
the
air
the
column
of
the
immaculate
conception
rose
lightly
into
the
sunshine
like
a
flower
stem
with
the
on
its
summit
the
barcaccia
glistened
in
a
shower
of
diamonds
the
stairway
of
the
trinità
opened
its
arms
gaily
towards
the
church
of
charles
the
two
towers
of
which
stood
out
boldly
against
the
blue
sky
exquisite
exclaimed
donna
maria
wonder
you
are
so
deeply
enamoured
of
rome
you
do
know
it
yet
andrea
replied
wish
i
might
be
your
guide
she
smiled
undertake
a
pilgrimage
of
sentiment
with
you
this
spring
she
smiled
again
and
her
whole
person
assumed
a
less
grave
and
chastened
air
her
dress
this
morning
had
a
quiet
elegance
about
it
but
revealed
the
refined
taste
of
an
expert
in
style
and
in
the
delicate
combinations
of
colour
her
jacket
of
a
shade
of
gray
inclining
to
green
was
of
cloth
trimmed
round
the
edge
with
beaver
and
opening
over
a
vest
of
the
same
fur
the
blending
of
the
two
tones
indefinable
gray
and
tawny
gold
forming
a
harmony
that
was
a
delight
to
the
eye
did
you
do
yesterday
evening
she
asked
left
the
a
few
minutes
after
you
and
went
home
and
i
stayed
there
because
i
seemed
to
feel
your
spirit
near
me
i
thought
much
did
you
not
my
thought
i
can
not
say
i
did
i
passed
a
very
cheerless
evening
i
do
not
know
why
i
felt
so
dreadfully
alone
the
contessa
di
lucoli
passed
in
her
driving
a
big
roan
giulia
moceto
accompanied
by
musellaro
passed
on
foot
and
then
donna
isotta
cellesi
andrea
bowed
to
each
donna
maria
asked
him
the
names
of
the
ladies
that
of
giulia
moceto
was
not
new
to
her
she
recalled
the
day
on
which
she
heard
francesca
mention
it
while
looking
at
perugino
archangel
michael
when
they
were
turning
over
andrea
drawings
at
schifanoja
she
followed
her
curiously
with
her
eyes
seized
with
a
sudden
vague
fear
everything
connecting
andrea
with
his
former
life
was
distasteful
to
her
she
wished
that
that
life
of
which
she
knew
next
to
nothing
could
be
entirely
wiped
out
of
the
memory
of
this
man
who
had
flung
himself
into
it
with
such
avidity
and
dragged
himself
out
with
so
much
weariness
so
many
losses
so
many
wounds
live
solely
in
you
and
for
you
with
no
and
no
yesterday
without
other
bond
or
preference
far
from
the
world
were
not
those
his
words
to
her
what
a
dream
matters
of
very
different
import
were
troubling
andrea
it
was
fast
approaching
the
princess
of
ferentino
lunch
hour
are
you
bound
for
he
asked
of
his
companion
to
make
the
most
of
the
sunshine
delfina
and
i
had
tea
and
sandwiches
at
nazzari
and
thought
of
going
up
to
the
pincio
and
visiting
the
villa
medici
if
you
would
care
to
come
with
us
he
had
a
moment
of
painful
hesitation
the
pincio
the
villa
medici
on
a
february
afternoon
with
her
but
he
could
not
well
get
out
of
the
lunch
besides
he
was
desperately
anxious
to
meet
elena
again
after
yesterday
episode
for
though
he
had
gone
to
the
angelieris
she
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
he
therefore
answered
with
an
inconsolable
air
wretchedly
unfortunate
i
am
obliged
to
be
at
a
lunch
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
accepted
the
invitation
a
week
ago
but
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
found
some
way
of
getting
out
of
it
what
a
nuisance
then
you
must
go
without
losing
a
moment
you
will
be
late
he
looked
at
his
watch
can
walk
a
little
further
with
you
do
let
us
go
up
the
steps
begged
delfina
went
up
yesterday
with
miss
dorothy
you
should
see
it
they
turned
back
and
crossed
the
square
a
child
followed
them
persistently
offering
a
great
branch
of
flowering
almond
which
andrea
bought
and
presented
to
delfina
blonde
ladies
issued
from
the
hotels
armed
with
red
bædekers
clumsy
hackney
coaches
with
two
horses
jogged
past
with
a
glint
of
brass
on
their
oldfashioned
harness
the
thrust
their
overflowing
baskets
in
front
of
the
strangers
vociferating
at
the
pitch
of
their
voices
you
promise
me
andrea
said
to
donna
maria
as
they
began
to
ascend
the
steps
you
promise
me
not
to
go
to
the
villa
medici
without
me
give
it
up
for
please
do
for
a
moment
she
seemed
preoccupied
by
sad
thoughts
then
she
answered
well
i
will
give
it
up
before
them
the
great
stairway
rose
triumphantly
its
steps
giving
out
a
gentle
heat
the
stone
itself
having
the
polished
gleam
of
old
silver
like
that
of
the
fountains
at
schifanoja
delfina
ran
on
in
front
with
her
and
caught
by
the
breeze
of
her
movement
some
of
its
faint
pink
petals
fluttered
away
like
butterflies
a
poignant
regret
pierced
the
young
man
heart
he
pictured
to
himself
the
delights
of
a
sentimental
walk
through
the
quiet
glades
of
the
villa
medici
in
the
early
hours
of
the
sunny
afternoon
whom
do
you
lunch
asked
donna
maria
after
an
interval
of
silence
the
old
princess
alberoni
he
replied
he
lied
to
her
once
more
for
some
instinct
warned
him
that
the
name
ferentino
might
arouse
some
suspicion
in
donna
maria
mind
then
she
said
and
held
out
her
hand
i
will
come
up
to
the
piazza
my
carriage
is
waiting
for
me
there
look
that
is
where
i
live
and
he
pointed
to
the
palazzo
zuccari
all
flooded
with
sunshine
donna
maria
eyes
lingered
upon
it
there
you
have
seen
it
will
you
come
there
sometimes
in
spirit
spirit
always
shall
i
not
see
you
before
saturday
evening
hardly
think
so
they
parted
she
turning
with
delfina
into
the
avenue
andrea
jumping
into
his
brougham
and
driving
off
down
the
via
gregoriana
he
arrived
at
the
ferentinos
a
few
minutes
late
he
made
his
apologies
elena
was
already
there
with
her
husband
lunch
was
served
in
a
dining
room
gay
with
tapestries
representing
scenes
after
the
manner
of
peter
loar
in
the
midst
of
these
beautiful
grotesques
a
brisk
fire
of
wit
and
sarcasm
soon
began
to
flash
and
scintillate
the
three
ladies
were
in
high
spirits
and
prompt
at
repartee
barbare
la
viti
laughed
her
sonorous
masculine
laugh
throwing
back
her
handsome
boyish
head
and
making
free
play
with
her
sparkling
black
eyes
elena
was
in
a
more
than
usually
brilliant
vein
and
impressed
andrea
as
being
so
far
removed
from
him
so
unfamiliar
so
unconcerned
that
he
almost
doubted
whether
scene
had
not
been
all
a
dream
ludovico
barbarisi
and
the
prince
of
ferentino
aided
and
abetted
the
ladies
lord
heathfield
entertained
his
friend
by
boring
him
to
extinction
with
questions
as
to
the
coming
sales
and
giving
him
minute
details
of
a
very
rare
edition
of
the
of
apuleius
roma
in
folio
which
he
had
acquired
a
day
or
two
ago
for
fifteen
hundred
and
twenty
lire
he
broke
off
every
now
and
then
to
watch
barbarella
and
then
that
gleam
of
dementia
would
flash
into
his
eyes
and
his
repulsive
hands
trembled
strangely
andrea
irritation
disgust
and
boredom
at
last
reached
such
a
pitch
that
he
was
unable
to
conceal
his
feelings
seem
out
of
spirits
ugenta
said
the
princess
a
little
perhaps
miching
mallecho
is
barbarisi
at
once
overwhelmed
him
with
importunate
questions
about
the
horse
ailments
and
then
lord
heathfield
recommenced
the
story
of
the
from
the
beginning
the
princess
turned
to
her
cousin
do
you
think
ludovico
she
said
with
a
laugh
at
the
concert
we
surprised
him
in
a
flirtation
with
an
incognita
we
did
added
elena
incognita
exclaimed
ludovico
but
perhaps
you
can
give
us
further
information
she
is
the
wife
of
the
new
minister
for
guatemala
i
know
the
moment
i
only
know
the
minister
i
see
him
playing
at
the
club
every
night
me
ugenta
has
she
been
received
at
court
yet
really
do
not
know
princess
andrea
returned
with
some
impatience
the
whole
business
had
become
simply
intolerable
to
him
elena
gaiety
jarred
horribly
on
him
and
her
husband
presence
was
more
odious
than
ever
but
if
he
was
out
of
temper
it
was
more
with
himself
than
with
the
rest
of
the
company
at
the
root
of
his
irritation
lay
a
dim
longing
after
the
pleasure
he
had
so
lately
rejected
hurt
and
offended
by
elena
indifference
his
heart
turned
with
poignant
regret
to
the
other
woman
and
he
pictured
her
wandering
pensive
and
alone
through
the
silent
avenues
more
beautiful
more
noble
than
ever
before
the
princess
rose
and
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
room
barbarella
ran
to
the
piano
which
was
entirely
enveloped
in
an
immense
antique
caparison
of
red
velvet
embroidered
with
dull
gold
and
began
to
sing
bizet
tarantelle
dedicated
to
christine
nilsson
elena
and
eva
leaned
over
her
to
read
the
music
while
ludovico
stood
behind
them
smoking
a
cigarette
the
prince
had
disappeared
but
lord
heathfield
kept
firm
hold
of
andrea
he
had
drawn
him
into
a
window
and
was
discoursing
to
him
on
certain
little
urbanese
which
he
had
picked
up
at
the
cavaliere
davila
sale
and
the
rasping
voice
with
its
aggravating
interrogative
inflections
the
gestures
with
which
he
indicated
the
dimensions
of
the
cups
and
his
glance
now
dull
and
fishy
now
keen
as
steel
under
the
great
prominent
brow
in
short
the
whole
man
was
so
unendurably
obnoxious
to
andrea
that
he
clenched
his
teeth
convulsively
like
a
patient
under
the
surgeon
knife
his
one
absorbing
thought
was
how
to
get
away
his
plan
was
to
rush
to
the
pincio
in
the
hope
of
finding
donna
maria
and
taking
her
after
all
to
the
villa
medici
it
was
about
two
he
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
glorious
sunshine
he
turned
back
into
the
room
and
saw
the
group
of
pretty
women
at
the
piano
bathed
in
the
red
glow
struck
out
of
the
velvet
cover
by
a
strong
golden
ray
with
this
red
glow
the
smoke
of
the
cigarette
mingled
lightly
as
the
talking
and
laughter
mingled
with
the
chords
barbarella
viti
struck
haphazard
on
the
keys
ludovico
whispered
a
word
or
two
in
his
cousin
ear
which
the
princess
forthwith
communicated
to
her
friends
for
there
was
a
renewed
burst
of
laughter
ringing
and
deep
like
a
string
of
pearls
dropping
into
a
silver
bowl
then
barbarella
took
up
bizet
air
again
in
a
low
voice
la
la
le
papillon
envolé
tra
la
la
andrea
was
anxiously
on
the
watch
for
a
favourable
moment
at
which
to
interrupt
lord
heathfield
harangue
and
make
his
escape
but
the
collector
had
entered
upon
a
series
of
rounded
periods
each
intimately
connected
with
the
other
without
one
break
without
one
pause
for
breath
a
single
stop
would
have
saved
the
persecuted
listener
but
it
never
came
and
the
victim
torments
grew
more
unbearable
every
minute
le
papillon
envolé
oui
ah
ah
ah
ah
andrea
looked
at
his
watch
already
excuse
me
marquis
but
i
must
go
he
left
the
window
and
went
over
to
the
ladies
you
excuse
me
princess
i
have
a
consultation
at
two
with
the
veterinary
surgeons
at
my
stables
he
took
leave
in
a
great
hurry
elena
gave
him
the
tips
of
her
fingers
barbarella
presented
him
with
saying
it
to
poor
mallecho
with
my
love
ludovico
offered
to
accompany
him
no
stay
where
you
are
he
bowed
and
left
flew
down
the
stairs
like
lightning
and
jumped
into
his
carriage
shouting
to
the
coachman
the
pincio
quick
he
was
filled
with
a
frenzied
longing
to
reach
maria
ferrès
side
to
enjoy
the
delights
which
he
had
refused
before
the
rapid
pace
of
his
horses
was
not
quick
enough
for
him
he
looked
out
anxiously
for
the
trinità
de
monti
the
avenue
the
gates
the
carriage
flashed
through
the
gates
he
ordered
the
coachman
to
moderate
his
pace
and
to
drive
through
each
of
the
avenues
his
heart
gave
a
bound
every
time
the
figure
of
a
woman
appeared
in
the
distance
through
the
trees
he
got
out
and
on
foot
explored
the
paths
forbidden
to
vehicles
he
searched
every
nook
and
corner
in
vain
the
villa
borghese
being
open
to
the
public
the
pincio
lay
deserted
and
silent
under
the
languid
smile
of
the
february
sun
few
carriages
or
disturbed
the
peaceful
solitude
of
the
place
the
trees
tinged
here
and
there
with
violet
spread
their
leafless
branches
against
a
diaphanous
sky
and
the
air
was
full
of
delicate
which
the
breeze
shook
and
tore
asunder
the
pines
and
cypresses
all
the
evergreen
trees
took
on
something
of
this
colourless
pallor
seemed
to
fade
and
melt
into
the
monotone
surely
something
of
donna
maria
sadness
still
lingered
in
the
atmosphere
andrea
stood
for
several
minutes
leaning
against
the
railings
of
the
villa
medici
crushed
beneath
a
load
of
melancholy
too
heavy
to
be
borne
chapter
iv
in
the
days
that
followed
the
double
pursuit
continued
with
the
same
tortures
or
worse
and
with
the
same
odious
mendacity
by
a
phenomenon
which
is
of
frequent
occurrence
in
the
moral
degradation
of
men
of
keen
intellect
he
now
had
a
terrible
lucidity
of
conscience
a
lucidity
without
interruptions
without
a
moment
of
dimness
or
eclipse
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
criticised
what
he
had
done
with
him
went
hand
in
hand
with
feebleness
of
will
but
his
variable
humour
his
incertitude
his
unaccountable
silences
and
equally
unaccountable
effusions
in
short
all
the
peculiarities
of
manner
which
such
a
condition
of
mind
inevitably
brings
along
with
it
only
increased
and
excited
the
passionate
commiseration
of
donna
maria
she
saw
him
suffer
and
it
filled
her
with
grief
and
tenderness
slow
degrees
i
shall
cure
him
she
thought
but
slowly
and
surely
without
being
aware
of
it
she
was
losing
her
strength
of
purpose
and
was
bending
to
the
sick
man
will
the
downward
slope
was
gentle
in
the
of
the
countess
starnina
an
indefinable
thrill
ran
through
her
when
she
felt
andrea
gaze
upon
her
bare
shoulders
and
arms
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
in
evening
dress
her
face
and
her
hands
were
all
he
knew
this
evening
he
saw
how
exquisite
was
the
shape
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
and
of
her
arms
too
although
they
were
a
little
thin
she
was
dressed
in
brocade
trimmed
with
sable
a
narrow
band
of
fur
edged
the
low
bodice
and
imparted
an
indescribable
delicacy
to
the
tints
of
the
skin
the
line
of
the
shoulders
from
the
neck
to
the
top
of
the
arms
had
that
gracious
slope
which
is
such
a
sure
mark
of
physical
aristocracy
and
so
rare
nowadays
in
her
magnificent
hair
arranged
in
the
manner
affected
by
verocchio
for
his
busts
there
was
not
one
jewel
not
one
flower
at
two
or
three
propitious
moments
andrea
murmured
words
of
passionate
admiration
in
her
ear
is
the
first
time
we
have
met
in
society
he
said
to
her
me
a
glove
as
a
souvenir
not
maria
no
be
quiet
those
hands
of
yours
do
you
remember
when
i
copied
them
at
schifanoja
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
right
to
them
as
if
you
ought
to
grant
them
to
me
of
your
whole
person
they
are
the
part
that
is
most
intimately
connected
with
your
soul
the
most
spiritualised
almost
one
might
say
the
purest
oh
hands
of
kindness
hands
of
pardon
how
dearly
i
should
love
to
possess
at
least
a
semblance
of
their
form
some
token
to
which
their
delicate
perfume
still
clings
you
will
give
me
a
glove
before
you
leave
she
did
not
answer
the
conversation
dropped
a
short
time
afterwards
on
being
asked
to
play
she
consented
and
drawing
off
her
gloves
laid
them
on
the
in
front
of
her
her
fingers
tapering
and
glittering
with
rings
looked
very
white
as
she
drew
off
their
delicate
covering
on
the
ring
finger
of
her
left
hand
blazed
a
great
opal
she
played
the
two
of
beethoven
op
the
one
dedicated
to
giulietta
guicciardi
expressed
a
hopeless
renunciation
told
of
an
awakening
after
a
dream
that
had
lasted
too
long
the
other
from
the
first
bars
of
the
described
by
its
full
smooth
rhythm
the
calm
that
comes
after
the
storm
then
passing
through
the
disquietude
of
the
second
movement
opened
out
into
an
of
luminous
serenity
and
ended
in
an
in
which
there
was
a
rising
note
of
courage
almost
of
fervour
though
surrounded
by
an
attentive
audience
andrea
felt
that
she
was
playing
for
him
alone
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
wandering
from
the
fingers
of
the
pianist
to
the
long
gloves
hanging
from
the
music
stand
which
still
retained
the
form
of
those
hands
still
preserved
an
inexpressible
charm
in
the
small
opening
at
the
wrist
where
but
a
short
time
ago
a
tiny
morsel
of
her
soft
flesh
had
been
visible
maria
rose
amidst
a
round
of
applause
she
left
the
piano
but
she
did
not
take
away
her
gloves
andrea
was
tempted
to
steal
had
she
not
perhaps
left
them
for
him
but
he
only
wanted
one
as
a
connoisseur
in
amatory
matters
has
said
a
pair
of
gloves
is
a
totally
different
thing
from
a
single
one
led
back
to
the
piano
by
the
insistence
of
the
countess
starnina
maria
removed
her
gloves
from
the
desk
and
placed
them
in
a
corner
of
the
keyboard
in
the
shadow
she
then
played
rameau
gavotte
gavotte
of
the
yellow
the
dance
of
indifference
and
love
andrea
regarded
her
fixedly
with
a
little
trepidation
when
she
rose
she
took
up
one
of
her
gloves
the
other
she
left
in
the
shadowy
corner
of
the
piano
for
him
three
days
afterwards
when
astonished
rome
had
awakened
to
find
itself
under
a
covering
of
snow
andrea
received
a
note
to
the
following
effect
between
eleven
and
twelve
you
will
wait
for
me
in
a
carriage
in
front
of
the
palazzo
barberini
outside
the
gates
if
by
midnight
i
am
not
there
you
can
go
away
the
tone
of
the
note
was
mysterious
and
romantic
was
it
in
remembrance
of
the
of
march
two
years
ago
lady
heathfield
seemed
particularly
fond
of
the
use
of
carriages
in
her
love
affairs
had
she
the
intention
of
taking
up
the
adventure
at
the
point
where
it
broke
off
and
why
andrea
could
not
repress
a
smile
he
had
just
come
back
from
a
visit
to
maria
a
very
pleasing
visit
and
his
heart
inclined
for
the
moment
more
to
the
siennese
than
to
the
other
his
ear
still
retained
the
sound
of
her
sweet
and
gentle
words
as
they
stood
together
at
the
window
and
watched
the
snow
falling
soft
as
peach
or
apple
blossom
on
the
trees
of
the
villa
aldobrandini
already
touched
with
the
presentiment
of
the
coming
spring
however
before
going
out
to
dinner
he
gave
very
particular
orders
to
stephen
eleven
found
him
in
front
of
the
palace
devoured
by
impatience
and
curiosity
the
novelty
of
the
situation
the
spectacle
of
the
snowy
night
the
mystery
and
uncertainty
of
it
all
inflamed
his
imagination
and
transported
him
beyond
the
realities
of
life
over
rome
on
that
memorable
february
night
there
shone
a
full
moon
of
fabulous
size
and
unheard
of
splendour
in
that
immense
radiance
the
surrounding
objects
seemed
to
exist
only
as
in
a
dream
impalpable
meteoric
and
visible
at
a
great
distance
by
virtue
of
some
fantastic
irradiation
of
their
own
the
snow
covered
the
railings
of
the
gateway
concealing
the
iron
and
transforming
it
into
a
piece
of
more
frail
and
airy
than
filigree
while
the
colossi
supported
it
as
oaks
support
a
spider
web
the
garden
looked
like
a
motionless
forest
of
enormous
and
lilies
all
of
ice
a
garden
under
some
lunar
enchantment
a
lifeless
paradise
of
selene
mute
solemn
and
massive
the
palazzo
barberini
reared
its
great
bulk
into
the
sky
its
most
salient
points
standing
out
dazzlingly
white
and
casting
a
pale
blue
shadow
as
transparent
as
light
he
waited
leaning
forward
on
the
watch
and
under
the
fascination
of
that
marvellous
spectacle
he
felt
the
spirits
that
wait
on
love
awake
in
him
that
the
lyric
summits
of
his
sentiment
began
to
gleam
and
glitter
like
the
frozen
shafts
of
the
gateway
under
the
moon
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
which
of
the
two
women
he
would
prefer
as
the
centre
of
this
fantastic
scenery
elena
heathfield
robed
in
imperial
purple
or
maria
ferrès
robed
in
ermine
and
as
he
lingered
pleasurably
over
this
uncertainty
of
choice
he
ended
by
mingling
and
confounding
his
two
anxieties
the
real
one
for
elena
and
the
imaginary
one
for
maria
a
clock
near
by
struck
in
the
silence
with
a
clear
vibrating
sound
and
each
stroke
seemed
to
break
something
crystalline
in
the
air
the
clock
of
the
trinità
de
monti
responded
to
the
call
and
after
that
the
clock
of
the
quirinal
then
others
faintly
out
of
the
distance
it
was
a
quarter
past
eleven
andrea
strained
his
eyes
towards
the
portico
would
she
dare
to
traverse
the
garden
on
foot
he
pictured
the
figure
of
elena
in
the
midst
of
all
this
dazzling
whiteness
then
in
an
instant
that
of
donna
maria
appeared
to
him
obliterating
the
other
triumphant
over
the
whiteness
super
this
night
of
moonlight
and
snow
then
was
under
the
dominance
of
maria
ferrès
as
under
some
invincible
actual
influence
the
image
of
the
pure
creature
grew
symbolically
out
of
the
sovereign
purity
of
the
surrounding
aspect
of
things
the
symbol
forcibly
on
the
spirit
of
the
poet
while
still
watching
to
see
if
the
other
one
would
come
he
gave
himself
up
to
a
vision
suggested
by
the
scene
before
him
it
was
a
poetic
almost
a
mystic
dream
he
was
waiting
for
donna
maria
she
had
chosen
this
night
of
supernatural
purity
on
which
to
sacrifice
her
own
purity
to
her
lover
desire
all
the
white
things
about
her
cognisant
of
the
great
sacrifice
about
to
be
accomplished
were
waiting
to
cry
and
at
the
passage
of
their
sister
the
silence
was
alive
and
behold
she
comes
per
lilia
et
super
she
comes
robed
in
ermine
her
tresses
bound
about
with
a
fillet
her
steps
lighter
than
a
shadow
the
moon
and
the
snow
are
less
pale
than
she
a
shadow
azure
as
the
light
that
tints
the
sapphire
accompanies
her
the
great
lilies
bend
not
as
she
passes
the
frost
has
congealed
them
has
made
them
like
the
asphodels
that
illumine
the
paths
of
hades
and
yet
like
those
of
the
christian
paradise
they
have
a
voice
and
say
with
one
accord
so
be
it
the
beloved
glides
on
to
the
sacrifice
already
she
nears
the
watcher
sitting
mute
and
icy
but
whose
eyes
are
burning
and
eloquent
and
on
her
hands
the
dear
hands
that
close
his
wounds
and
open
the
doors
of
dreams
he
presses
his
so
be
it
then
on
her
lips
the
dear
lips
that
know
no
word
of
falseness
he
lays
his
kiss
released
from
the
fillet
her
hair
spreads
like
a
glorious
flood
in
which
all
the
shadows
of
the
night
put
to
flight
by
the
moon
and
the
snow
seem
to
have
taken
refuge
suis
obumbrabit
tibi
et
sub
comis
peccavit
and
still
the
other
did
not
come
through
the
silence
through
the
poetry
the
hours
of
men
sounded
again
from
the
towers
and
belfries
of
rome
a
carriage
or
two
rolled
noiselessly
past
the
four
fountains
towards
the
piazza
or
crawled
slowly
up
towards
santa
maria
maggiore
and
each
shone
yellow
as
a
topaz
in
the
light
it
seemed
as
if
the
night
reaching
its
highest
point
had
grown
more
luminously
radiant
the
filigree
of
the
gateway
twinkled
and
flashed
as
if
its
silver
embroideries
were
studded
with
jewels
in
the
palace
great
circles
of
dazzling
light
shone
on
the
windows
like
diamond
florins
if
she
does
not
come
thought
andrea
to
himself
the
flood
of
lyric
fervour
that
had
passed
over
his
soul
at
maria
name
had
submerged
the
anxiety
of
his
vigil
had
appeased
his
desire
and
calmed
his
impatience
for
a
moment
the
thought
that
she
would
not
come
only
made
him
smile
but
the
next
the
anguish
of
uncertainty
began
again
worse
than
ever
and
he
was
tortured
by
the
vision
of
the
joys
that
might
have
been
his
here
in
the
warm
carriage
where
the
roses
breathed
so
sweet
an
atmosphere
besides
which
his
sufferings
were
further
increased
as
on
new
year
eve
by
a
sharp
touch
of
wounded
vanity
it
annoyed
him
particularly
that
his
delicate
preparations
for
a
love
scene
should
thus
be
wasted
and
useless
in
the
carriage
the
cold
was
tempered
by
the
pleasant
warmth
diffused
by
a
metal
full
of
hot
water
a
bunch
of
white
roses
snowy
moonlike
lay
on
the
bracket
in
front
of
the
seat
a
white
covered
his
knees
everything
pointed
to
an
intentional
arrangement
of
a
sort
of
en
the
clocks
struck
for
the
third
time
it
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
the
vigil
had
lasted
too
long
andrea
was
growing
tired
and
cross
in
elena
apartments
in
the
left
wing
of
the
palace
there
was
no
light
but
that
which
came
from
outside
was
she
coming
and
if
so
in
what
manner
secretly
under
what
pretext
lord
heathfield
was
certainly
in
rome
how
would
she
explain
her
nocturnal
absence
once
more
the
soul
of
the
former
lover
was
torn
with
curiosity
once
more
jealousy
gnawed
at
his
heart
and
carnal
passion
inflamed
him
he
thought
of
derisive
suggestion
about
the
husband
and
he
determined
to
have
elena
again
at
all
costs
both
for
pleasure
and
for
revenge
oh
if
only
she
would
come
a
carriage
drove
through
the
gates
and
into
the
garden
he
leaned
forward
to
look
at
it
he
recognised
elena
horses
and
caught
a
glimpse
inside
of
the
figure
of
a
woman
the
carriage
disappeared
into
the
portico
he
remained
perplexed
she
had
been
out
then
she
had
returned
alone
he
fixed
a
scrutinising
gaze
upon
the
portico
the
carriage
came
out
passed
through
the
garden
and
drove
away
towards
the
via
rasella
it
was
empty
it
wanted
but
two
or
three
minutes
to
midnight
and
she
had
not
come
it
struck
the
hour
a
bitter
pang
smote
the
heart
of
the
deluded
watcher
she
was
not
coming
unable
to
see
any
cause
for
her
having
missed
the
appointment
he
turned
upon
her
in
sudden
anger
he
even
had
a
suspicion
that
she
might
have
wished
to
inflict
a
humiliation
a
punishment
upon
him
or
else
that
she
had
merely
indulged
in
a
whim
in
order
to
inflame
his
desire
afresh
the
next
moment
he
called
to
the
coachman
del
quirinale
he
yielded
to
the
attraction
of
maria
ferrès
he
abandoned
himself
once
more
to
the
vaguely
tender
sentiment
which
ever
since
his
visit
in
the
afternoon
had
left
as
it
were
a
perfume
in
his
soul
and
suggested
to
him
thoughts
and
images
of
poetic
beauty
the
recent
disappointment
proving
as
he
considered
elena
malice
and
indifference
urged
him
more
strongly
than
ever
towards
the
love
and
goodness
of
the
other
his
regret
for
the
loss
of
so
beautiful
a
night
increased
under
the
influence
of
the
vision
he
had
dreamed
just
now
and
truth
to
tell
it
was
one
of
the
most
enchanting
nights
rome
had
ever
known
one
of
those
spectacles
that
oppress
the
human
soul
with
deep
sadness
because
they
transcend
all
power
of
admiration
all
possibility
of
human
expression
the
piazza
del
quirinale
magnified
by
the
whiteness
lay
spread
out
solitary
and
dazzling
like
an
olympian
acropolis
above
the
silent
city
the
edifices
surrounding
it
reared
their
stately
proportions
into
the
deep
sky
bernini
great
portal
to
the
royal
palace
surmounted
by
the
loggia
offered
an
optical
delusion
by
seeming
to
detach
itself
from
the
building
and
stand
out
all
alone
in
all
its
unwieldy
magnificence
like
some
mausoleum
sculptured
out
of
a
meteoric
block
of
stone
the
rich
architraves
to
the
palazzo
della
consulta
were
curiously
transformed
by
the
accumulated
masses
of
snow
sublime
amidst
the
uniform
whiteness
the
colossal
statues
seemed
to
dominate
all
things
the
grouping
of
the
dioscuri
and
the
horses
looked
bolder
and
larger
in
that
light
the
broad
backs
of
the
steeds
glittered
under
jewelled
trappings
there
was
a
sparkle
as
of
diamonds
on
the
shoulders
and
the
uplifted
arm
of
each
an
august
solemnity
flowed
from
the
monument
rome
lay
plunged
in
a
silence
motionless
empty
a
city
under
a
spell
the
houses
the
churches
the
spires
and
turrets
all
the
confusion
and
intermingling
of
christian
and
pagan
architecture
resolved
itself
into
one
unbroken
forest
between
the
heights
of
the
janiculum
and
the
monte
mario
drowned
in
a
silvery
vapour
far
off
infinitely
immaterial
reminding
one
a
little
of
a
lunar
landscape
calling
up
visions
of
some
half
extinct
planet
peopled
by
shades
the
dome
of
peter
shining
with
a
peculiar
metallic
lustre
in
the
blue
atmosphere
looked
gigantic
and
so
close
that
one
might
have
thought
to
touch
it
and
the
two
youthful
heroes
sons
of
the
swan
radiant
with
beauty
in
the
vast
expanse
of
whiteness
as
in
the
apotheosis
of
their
origin
seemed
to
be
the
immortal
genii
of
rome
guarding
the
slumbers
of
the
sacred
city
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
the
palace
and
remained
there
for
a
long
time
the
poet
was
once
more
absorbed
in
his
impossible
dream
and
maria
ferrès
was
quite
near
was
perhaps
watching
and
dreaming
also
perhaps
she
too
felt
the
grandeur
of
the
night
weighing
upon
her
heart
and
crushing
it
in
vain
slowly
the
carriage
passed
her
closed
door
while
the
windows
reflected
the
full
moon
gazing
at
the
hanging
gardens
of
the
villa
aldobrandini
where
the
trees
looked
like
aërial
miracles
and
as
he
passed
the
poet
threw
the
bunch
of
roses
on
to
the
snow
before
donna
maria
door
in
token
of
homage
chapter
v
saw
i
guessed
i
had
been
at
the
window
for
a
long
time
unable
to
tear
myself
away
from
the
fascination
of
all
that
whiteness
i
saw
the
carriage
pass
slowly
in
the
snow
i
felt
that
it
was
you
before
i
saw
you
throw
the
roses
no
words
can
describe
to
you
the
tenderness
of
my
tears
i
wept
for
you
from
love
and
for
the
roses
out
of
pity
poor
roses
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
alive
and
must
suffer
and
die
in
the
snow
i
seemed
to
hear
them
call
to
me
and
lament
like
human
creatures
that
have
been
deserted
as
soon
as
your
carriage
had
disappeared
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
look
at
them
i
was
on
the
point
of
going
down
into
the
street
to
pick
them
up
but
a
servant
was
still
in
the
hall
waiting
up
for
some
one
i
thought
of
a
thousand
plans
but
could
find
none
that
was
practicable
i
was
in
despair
you
smile
truly
i
hardly
know
what
madness
had
come
over
me
i
watched
the
anxiously
my
eyes
full
of
tears
if
any
one
of
them
had
trodden
on
the
roses
he
would
have
trampled
upon
my
heart
and
yet
in
all
this
torment
i
was
happy
happy
in
your
love
in
the
delicacy
of
your
passionate
homage
in
your
gentleness
your
when
at
last
i
fell
asleep
i
was
sad
and
happy
together
the
roses
must
have
been
nearly
dead
by
that
time
after
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
the
sound
of
spades
upon
the
pavement
woke
me
up
they
were
shovelling
away
the
snow
just
in
front
of
my
door
i
listened
the
noise
and
the
voices
continued
till
after
daylight
and
filled
me
with
unutterable
sadness
poor
roses
but
they
will
always
live
and
bloom
in
my
heart
there
are
certain
memories
that
can
perfume
a
soul
for
ever
do
you
love
me
very
much
andrea
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
you
love
only
me
have
you
forgotten
all
the
rest
do
all
your
thoughts
belong
to
me
her
breath
came
fast
and
she
was
trembling
suffer
at
the
thought
of
your
former
life
the
past
of
which
i
know
nothing
of
your
memories
of
all
the
marks
left
upon
your
soul
of
that
in
you
which
i
shall
never
understand
never
possess
oh
if
i
could
but
wipe
it
all
out
for
you
incessantly
andrea
i
hear
your
first
your
very
first
words
i
believe
i
shall
hear
them
at
the
moment
of
my
death
she
panted
and
trembled
shaken
by
the
force
of
passion
day
i
love
you
more
every
day
more
he
intoxicated
her
with
words
of
honied
sweetness
he
was
more
fervent
than
herself
he
told
her
of
his
visions
in
the
night
of
snow
and
of
his
despairing
desire
and
some
plausible
story
of
the
roses
and
a
thousand
other
lyric
fancies
he
judged
her
to
be
on
the
point
of
yielding
he
saw
her
eyes
swim
in
melting
languor
and
on
her
plaintive
mouth
that
nameless
contraction
which
seems
like
an
instinctive
dissimulation
of
the
physical
desire
to
kiss
he
looked
at
her
hands
so
delicate
and
yet
so
strong
the
hands
of
an
archangel
and
saw
them
trembling
like
the
strings
of
an
instrument
expressing
all
the
anguish
of
her
soul
i
could
succeed
in
stealing
even
the
most
fleeting
kiss
from
her
he
thought
should
find
myself
considerably
nearer
the
goal
of
my
desires
but
conscious
of
her
peril
she
rose
hastily
with
an
apology
and
ringing
the
bell
ordered
tea
and
sent
to
ask
miss
dorothy
to
bring
delfina
to
the
is
better
so
she
said
turning
to
andrea
with
the
traces
of
her
agitation
still
visible
in
her
face
me
and
from
that
day
she
avoided
receiving
him
except
on
tuesday
and
saturday
when
she
was
at
home
to
every
one
nevertheless
she
allowed
andrea
to
conduct
her
on
long
peregrinations
through
the
rome
of
the
emperors
and
the
rome
of
the
popes
through
the
villas
the
museums
the
churches
the
ruins
where
elena
muti
had
passed
there
maria
ferrès
passed
also
often
enough
the
sights
they
visited
suggested
to
the
poet
the
same
eloquent
effusions
which
elena
had
once
heard
often
enough
some
recollection
carried
him
away
suddenly
from
the
present
and
disturbed
him
strangely
are
you
thinking
of
at
this
moment
donna
maria
would
ask
him
looking
him
deep
in
the
eyes
with
a
shade
of
suspicion
you
always
of
you
he
answered
am
sometimes
seized
with
curiosity
to
look
into
my
own
soul
to
see
if
there
remains
one
tiny
particle
that
does
not
belong
to
you
one
smallest
corner
still
closed
to
your
light
it
is
an
exploration
made
for
you
as
you
can
not
make
it
for
yourself
i
may
say
with
truth
maria
that
i
have
nothing
more
to
give
you
you
have
absolute
dominion
over
me
never
i
think
in
spirit
has
one
human
being
possessed
another
so
entirely
if
my
lips
were
to
meet
yours
my
whole
life
would
be
absorbed
in
yours
i
believe
i
should
die
of
it
she
had
full
faith
in
his
words
for
his
voice
lent
them
the
fire
of
truth
one
day
they
were
in
the
belvedere
of
the
villa
medici
and
were
watching
the
gold
of
the
sun
fade
slowly
from
the
sky
while
the
villa
borghese
still
bare
and
leafless
sank
gently
into
a
violet
mist
touched
with
sudden
melancholy
she
said
knows
how
many
times
you
have
come
here
to
feel
yourself
beloved
do
not
know
he
answered
like
a
man
lost
in
a
dream
do
not
remember
what
are
you
saying
she
was
silent
then
she
rose
to
read
the
inscriptions
written
on
the
pillars
of
the
little
temple
they
were
for
the
most
part
written
by
lovers
by
couples
by
solitary
dreamers
all
expressed
some
sentiment
of
love
grave
or
gay
they
sang
the
praises
of
a
beauty
or
mourned
a
lost
delight
they
told
of
some
burning
kiss
or
ecstasy
of
languor
they
thanked
the
ancient
wooded
glades
that
had
sheltered
their
love
pointed
out
some
secret
nook
to
the
happy
visitor
of
the
morrow
described
the
lingering
charms
of
a
sunset
they
had
watched
all
of
them
whether
lovers
or
married
under
the
fascination
of
the
eternal
feminine
had
been
seized
with
lyric
fervour
in
this
little
lonely
belvedere
to
which
they
ascended
by
a
flight
of
steps
carpeted
with
moss
as
thick
as
velvet
the
very
walls
spoke
an
indefinable
melancholy
emanated
from
these
unknown
voices
of
vanished
lovers
a
sadness
that
seemed
almost
sepulchral
as
if
they
had
been
epitaphs
in
a
chapel
suddenly
maria
turned
to
andrea
have
been
here
too
she
said
do
not
know
he
answered
again
looking
at
her
in
the
same
dreamy
way
as
before
do
not
remember
i
remember
nothing
i
love
you
she
read
written
in
andrea
hand
an
epigram
of
goethe
a
distich
the
one
beginning
wie
lebst
du
say
how
livest
thou
lebe
i
live
were
it
mine
to
live
a
hundred
hundred
years
my
only
wish
would
be
that
should
be
as
underneath
this
there
was
a
date
ultima
and
a
name
us
go
she
said
the
canopy
of
branches
cast
deep
shadows
over
the
little
stairway
you
take
my
arm
he
asked
thank
you
she
replied
they
went
on
in
silence
the
heart
of
each
was
heavy
presently
she
said
were
very
happy
two
years
ago
and
he
persisting
in
his
tone
of
reverie
do
not
know
i
do
not
remember
in
the
green
twilight
the
path
was
mysterious
the
trunks
and
branches
of
the
trees
were
coiled
and
interlaced
like
serpents
here
and
there
a
leaf
gleamed
through
the
shade
like
an
emerald
green
eye
after
an
interval
of
silence
she
began
again
was
that
elena
do
not
know
i
have
forgotten
i
remember
nothing
but
that
i
love
you
i
love
none
but
you
i
think
only
of
you
i
live
for
you
alone
i
know
nothing
i
wish
for
nothing
but
your
love
every
fetter
that
binds
me
to
my
former
life
is
broken
now
i
am
far
from
the
world
utterly
lost
in
you
i
live
in
your
heart
and
in
your
soul
i
in
every
throb
of
your
pulse
i
do
not
touch
you
and
yet
i
am
as
close
to
you
as
if
i
held
you
in
my
arms
pressed
to
my
lips
to
my
heart
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
and
that
has
been
for
ages
and
will
last
for
ages
to
all
eternity
at
your
side
thinking
of
you
living
in
you
i
am
conscious
of
the
infinite
the
eternal
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
i
know
nothing
else
i
remember
nothing
else
on
all
her
sadness
all
her
suspicions
he
poured
out
a
flood
of
warm
fond
eloquence
and
she
listened
standing
straight
and
slender
in
front
of
the
balustrade
that
runs
round
the
wide
terrace
it
true
is
it
true
she
repeated
in
a
faint
voice
like
the
echo
of
a
moan
out
of
the
depth
of
her
soul
that
true
it
is
true
and
that
alone
is
true
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
i
am
yours
as
you
are
mine
i
know
you
to
be
so
absolutely
mine
that
i
ask
for
no
caress
i
ask
for
no
proof
of
your
love
i
can
wait
my
dearest
delight
is
to
obey
you
i
ask
for
no
caresses
but
i
can
feel
them
in
your
voice
in
your
eyes
your
attitudes
your
slightest
movement
all
that
comes
to
me
from
you
intoxicates
me
like
a
kiss
and
when
i
touch
your
hand
i
know
not
which
is
greater
the
rapture
of
my
senses
or
the
exaltation
of
my
soul
he
lightly
laid
his
hand
on
hers
she
trembled
drawn
by
a
wild
desire
to
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
to
offer
him
at
last
her
lips
her
kiss
herself
it
seemed
to
her
for
she
believed
blindly
in
words
that
by
so
doing
she
would
bind
him
to
her
finally
with
an
indissoluble
bond
she
felt
that
she
was
going
to
swoon
to
die
it
was
as
if
the
tumults
of
passion
from
which
she
had
already
suffered
swelled
her
heart
and
increased
the
present
storm
as
if
into
this
one
moment
of
time
were
gathered
all
the
varying
emotions
she
had
experienced
since
she
first
knew
this
man
the
roses
of
schifanoja
bloomed
again
among
the
shrubs
and
laurels
of
the
villa
medici
shall
wait
maria
i
shall
be
true
to
my
promises
i
ask
nothing
of
you
i
wait
and
look
forward
to
the
supreme
moment
that
moment
will
come
i
know
it
for
the
power
of
love
is
invincible
and
all
your
fears
all
your
terrors
will
vanish
and
the
communion
of
the
body
will
seem
to
you
as
pure
as
the
communion
of
the
soul
for
all
flames
are
alike
in
purity
he
clasped
maria
ungloved
hand
in
his
the
gardens
seemed
deserted
from
the
palace
of
the
accademia
came
not
a
sound
not
a
voice
clear
through
the
silence
they
heard
the
lisp
of
the
fountain
in
the
middle
of
the
esplanade
the
avenues
stretched
away
towards
the
pincio
straight
and
rigid
as
if
enclosed
between
two
walls
of
bronze
upon
which
the
gilding
of
the
sunset
still
lingered
the
absolute
immobility
of
all
things
suggested
the
idea
of
a
petrified
labyrinth
the
reeds
round
the
basin
of
the
fountain
were
not
less
motionless
than
the
statues
feel
said
donna
maria
her
eyes
if
i
were
on
one
of
the
terraces
at
schifanoja
far
far
away
from
rome
alone
with
you
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
see
the
sea
born
of
her
love
and
of
the
silence
she
saw
a
vision
rise
up
before
her
and
spread
wide
under
the
setting
sun
andrea
gaze
was
upon
her
she
said
no
more
but
she
smiled
faintly
as
she
uttered
the
two
words
you
she
closed
her
eyes
but
her
mouth
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
luminous
as
if
on
it
were
concentrated
all
the
splendour
veiled
by
her
quivering
lids
and
her
eyelashes
feel
as
if
none
of
these
things
existed
outside
of
my
consciousness
but
that
you
had
created
them
in
my
soul
for
my
delight
i
am
profoundly
affected
with
this
illusion
each
time
i
stand
before
some
spectacle
of
beauty
and
you
are
at
my
side
the
words
came
slowly
with
pauses
in
between
as
if
her
voice
were
the
halting
echo
of
some
other
voice
imperceptible
to
the
senses
imparting
to
her
words
a
singular
accent
a
tone
of
mystery
revealing
that
they
proceeded
from
the
innermost
depths
of
her
heart
they
were
no
longer
the
ordinary
imperfect
symbols
of
thoughts
they
were
transformed
into
a
more
intense
means
of
expression
transcendant
quivering
with
life
of
infinitely
ampler
signification
from
her
lips
as
from
a
hyacinth
full
of
a
liquid
murmur
drops
killing
the
sense
with
passion
sweet
as
stops
of
planetary
music
heard
in
trance
andrea
thought
of
shelley
lines
he
repeated
them
to
maria
feeling
the
contagion
of
her
emotion
penetrated
by
the
charm
of
the
hour
and
the
scene
in
my
hours
of
loftiest
spiritual
flights
have
i
attained
to
such
heights
you
lift
yourself
above
my
sublimest
dream
shine
resplendent
above
my
most
radiant
thoughts
you
illumine
me
with
a
ray
that
is
almost
brighter
than
i
can
bear
she
stood
up
straight
and
slender
against
the
balustrade
her
hands
clasping
the
stone
her
head
high
her
face
more
pallid
than
on
the
memorable
morning
when
they
walked
beneath
the
flowering
trees
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
glittered
upon
her
lashes
and
as
she
gazed
before
her
she
saw
the
sky
all
through
the
mist
of
her
tears
the
sky
seemed
to
rain
roses
as
on
that
evening
in
october
when
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
hill
at
rovigliano
lit
up
the
deep
pools
in
the
the
villa
medici
eternally
green
and
flowerless
received
upon
the
tops
of
its
rigid
arboreal
walls
this
gentle
rain
of
innumerable
petals
showered
down
from
the
celestial
gardens
she
turned
to
go
down
andrea
followed
her
they
walked
in
silence
towards
the
stairway
they
looked
at
the
wood
that
stretched
between
the
terrace
and
the
belvedere
the
light
seemed
to
stop
short
at
the
entrance
to
it
where
stood
the
two
guardian
statues
unable
to
pierce
the
further
gloom
and
the
trees
looked
as
if
they
spread
their
branches
in
a
different
atmosphere
or
rather
in
some
dark
waters
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
like
giant
marine
plants
she
was
seized
with
sudden
terror
hastening
towards
the
steps
she
ran
down
five
or
six
and
then
stopped
dazed
and
panting
through
the
silence
she
heard
the
beating
of
her
heart
like
the
roll
of
distant
thunder
the
villa
medici
was
no
longer
in
sight
the
stairway
was
enclosed
between
two
walls
damp
and
gray
and
with
grass
growing
in
the
cracks
gloomy
as
a
subterranean
dungeon
she
saw
andrea
lean
down
swiftly
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
no
andrea
no
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
draw
her
to
him
to
hold
her
fast
wildly
she
seized
one
of
his
hands
and
carried
it
to
her
lips
she
kissed
it
twice
thrice
with
frenzied
passion
then
she
fled
down
the
steps
to
the
gate
like
a
mad
creature
maria
stop
they
stood
together
before
the
closed
gate
pale
panting
shaken
trembling
from
head
to
foot
gazing
at
one
another
with
wide
distraught
eyes
their
ears
filled
with
the
throb
of
their
mad
pulses
a
sense
of
choking
in
their
throats
then
suddenly
with
one
impulse
they
were
in
each
other
arms
heart
to
heart
lips
to
lips
you
are
killing
me
she
murmured
leaning
half
fainting
against
the
gateway
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
entreaty
for
a
moment
they
stood
facing
one
another
without
touching
all
the
silence
of
the
villa
seemed
to
weigh
upon
them
in
this
narrow
spot
enclosed
in
its
high
walls
like
an
open
tomb
high
above
them
sounded
the
hoarse
cawing
of
the
rooks
gathering
on
the
roofs
of
the
palaces
or
crossing
the
sky
once
more
a
strange
fear
possessed
maria
heart
she
cast
a
glance
up
at
the
top
of
the
walls
then
with
a
visible
effort
she
said
quickly
can
go
now
will
you
open
the
gate
and
in
her
uncontrollable
haste
to
get
away
her
hand
met
andrea
on
the
latch
of
the
gate
as
she
passed
between
the
two
granite
columns
and
under
the
jasmin
andrea
said
the
jasmin
is
just
going
to
blossom
she
did
not
turn
but
she
smiled
a
smile
that
was
infinitely
sad
because
of
the
shadow
cast
upon
her
heart
by
the
sudden
recollection
of
the
name
she
had
read
in
the
belvedere
and
while
she
walked
through
the
mysterious
gloom
of
the
avenue
and
she
felt
his
kiss
flame
in
her
blood
a
ruthless
torture
graved
deep
into
her
heart
that
name
oh
that
name
chapter
vi
lord
heathfield
opened
the
great
containing
his
private
collection
and
turning
to
sperelli
should
design
the
clasps
for
this
volume
he
said
is
in
quarto
and
dated
from
lampsacus
the
engravings
seem
to
me
extremely
fine
what
do
you
think
he
handed
andrea
the
rare
volume
which
was
illustrated
with
erotic
vignettes
is
a
very
notable
figure
he
continued
pointing
to
one
of
the
vignettes
that
was
quite
new
to
me
none
of
my
erotic
authors
mention
it
he
talked
incessantly
discussing
each
detail
and
following
the
lines
of
the
drawing
with
a
flabby
white
finger
covered
with
hairs
on
the
first
joint
and
ending
in
a
polished
pointed
nail
a
little
livid
like
the
nail
of
an
ape
his
voice
grated
hideously
on
sperelli
ear
dutch
edition
of
petronius
is
magnificent
and
here
is
the
printed
in
paris
do
you
know
the
poem
attributed
to
john
wilkes
essay
on
this
is
an
edition
of
the
collection
was
very
complete
it
comprised
all
the
most
infamous
the
most
refinedly
sensual
works
that
the
human
mind
has
produced
in
the
course
of
centuries
to
serve
as
a
commentary
to
the
ancient
hymn
in
honour
of
the
god
of
lampsacus
sancte
the
collector
took
the
books
down
from
their
shelves
and
showed
them
in
turn
to
his
friend
never
pausing
in
his
discourse
his
hands
grew
caressing
as
he
touched
each
volume
bound
in
priceless
leather
or
material
a
subtle
smile
played
continually
round
his
lips
and
a
gleam
as
of
madness
flashed
from
time
to
time
into
his
eyes
also

a
first
edition
of
the
epigrams

by

it

clasps

by
a
master
hand
sperelli
listened
and
looked
in
a
sort
of
stupor
that
changed
by
degrees
into
horror
and
distress
his
eyes
were
continually
drawn
to
a
portrait
of
elena
hanging
on
the
wall
against
the
red
damask
background
is
elena
portrait
by
frederick
leighton
but
now
look
at
this
the
frontispiece
the
headings
the
initial
letters
the
marginal
ornaments
combine
all
that
is
most
perfect
in
the
matter
of
erotic
iconography
look
at
the
clasps
the
binding
was
exquisite
wrinkled
and
rough
as
that
which
surrounds
the
hilts
of
japanese
sabres
covered
the
sides
and
back
the
clasps
and
bosses
of
richly
silvered
bronze
were
chased
with
consummate
elegance
and
were
worthy
to
rank
with
the
best
work
of
the
sixteenth
century
artist
francis
redgrave
died
in
a
lunatic
asylum
he
was
a
young
genius
of
great
promise
i
have
all
his
studies
i
will
show
them
to
you
the
collector
warmed
to
his
subject
he
went
away
to
fetch
the
portfolio
from
the
next
room
his
gait
was
somewhat
jerky
and
uncertain
like
that
of
a
man
who
already
carries
in
his
system
the
germ
of
paralysis
the
first
touch
of
spinal
disease
his
body
remained
rigid
without
following
the
movement
of
his
limbs
like
the
body
of
an
automaton
andrea
sperelli
followed
him
with
his
eyes
till
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
room
the
moment
he
was
alone
unspeakable
anguish
rent
his
soul
this
room
hung
with
damask
exactly
like
the
one
in
which
elena
had
received
him
two
years
ago
seemed
to
him
tragic
and
sinister
these
were
perhaps
the
very
same
hangings
that
had
heard
elena
say
to
him
that
day
love
you
the
was
open
and
he
could
see
the
rows
of
obscene
books
the
bizarre
bindings
stamped
with
symbolic
decorations
on
the
wall
hung
the
portrait
of
lady
heathfield
side
by
side
with
a
copy
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
nelly
and
the
two
women
looked
out
of
the
canvas
with
the
same
piercing
intensity
the
same
glow
of
passion
the
same
flame
of
sensual
desire
the
same
marvellous
eloquence
each
had
a
mouth
that
was
ambiguous
enigmatical
sibylline
the
mouth
of
the
insatiable
absorber
of
souls
and
each
had
a
brow
of
marble
whiteness
immaculately
radiantly
pure
redgrave
said
lord
heathfield
returning
with
the
portfolio
of
drawings
was
a
genius
for
you
there
never
was
an
erotic
imagination
to
equal
his
look
look
what
style
what
profound
knowledge
of
the
potentialities
of
the
human
figure
for
expression
he
left
andrea
side
for
a
moment
in
order
to
close
the
door
then
he
returned
to
the
table
in
the
window
and
began
turning
over
the
collection
under
sperelli
eyes
talking
without
a
pause
pointing
out
with
that
finger
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
each
figure
he
spoke
in
his
own
language
beginning
each
sentence
with
an
interrogative
intonation
and
ending
with
a
monotonous
irritating
drop
of
the
voice
certain
words
lacerated
andrea
ear
like
the
sound
of
filing
iron
or
the
shriek
of
a
steel
knife
over
a
pane
of
glass
and
the
drawings
passed
in
review
before
him
appalling
pictures
which
revealed
the
terrible
fever
that
had
taken
hold
upon
the
artist
hand
and
the
terrible
madness
that
possessed
his
brain
here
said
lord
heathfield
the
work
which
inspired
these
masterpieces
a
priceless
book
rarest
of
the
rare
you
are
not
acquainted
with
daniel
maclisius
he
handed
andrea
the
treatise
verberatione
he
had
warmed
more
and
more
to
his
subject
his
bald
temples
were
flushed
and
the
veins
stood
out
on
his
great
forehead
every
minute
his
mouth
twitched
a
little
convulsively
and
his
hands
those
detestable
hands
were
perpetually
on
the
move
while
his
arms
retailed
their
paralytic
immobility
the
unclean
beast
in
him
appeared
in
all
its
brazen
ugliness
and
ferocity
mumps
are
you
alone
it
was
elena
voice
she
knocked
softly
at
one
of
the
doors
andrea
started
violently
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
and
drew
a
veil
of
mist
before
his
eyes
and
there
was
a
roar
in
his
ears
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
seized
with
vertigo
in
the
midst
of
the
fever
of
excitement
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
these
books
these
pictures
the
maddening
discourses
of
his
host
a
furious
instinct
rose
out
of
the
blind
depths
of
his
being
the
same
brutal
impetus
which
he
had
already
experienced
on
the
after
his
victory
over
rutolo
amid
the
acrid
exhalations
of
his
steaming
horse
the
phantasm
of
a
crime
of
love
tempted
and
beckoned
to
him
to
kill
this
man
take
the
woman
by
force
wreak
his
brutal
will
upon
her
and
then
kill
himself
but
it
passed
rapidly
as
it
had
come
i
am
not
alone
answered
the
husband
without
opening
the
door
a
few
minutes
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
bringing
count
sperelli
to
you
he
is
here
with
me
he
replaced
the
book
in
the
closed
the
portfolio
and
carried
it
back
into
the
next
room
andrea
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
not
to
have
to
undergo
the
ordeal
that
awaited
him
and
yet
it
attracted
him
strangely
once
more
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
crimson
wall
and
the
dark
frame
out
of
which
elena
pallid
face
looked
forth
that
face
with
the
haunting
eyes
and
the
sibylline
mouth
a
penetrating
and
continuous
fascination
emanated
from
that
imperious
image
that
strange
pallor
dominated
tragically
the
whole
crimson
gloom
of
the
apartment
and
once
again
he
felt
that
his
miserable
passion
was
incurable
you
come
into
the
asked
the
husband
reappearing
in
the
doorway
perfectly
calm
and
composed
you
will
design
those
clasps
for
me
will
try
answered
andrea
he
was
quite
unable
to
control
his
inward
agitation
elena
looked
at
him
with
a
provocative
smile
were
you
doing
in
there
she
asked
him
still
smiling
in
the
same
manner
husband
was
showing
me
some
unique
curiosities
there
was
a
sardonic
sneer
upon
her
lips
a
manifest
mocking
scorn
in
her
voice
she
settled
herself
on
a
wide
divan
covered
with
a
bokhara
carpet
of
faded
amaranthine
hues
on
which
languished
great
cushions
embroidered
with
spreading
palms
of
dull
gold
here
she
leaned
back
in
an
easy
graceful
attitude
and
gazed
at
andrea
from
under
her
drooping
eyelids
while
she
spoke
of
trivial
society
matters
in
a
voice
that
insinuated
its
tones
into
the
young
man
heart
and
crept
through
his
blood
like
an
invisible
fire
two
or
three
times
he
surprised
a
look
which
lord
heathfield
fixed
upon
his
wife
a
look
that
seemed
surcharged
with
all
the
infamies
he
had
stirred
up
just
now
again
that
criminal
thought
sped
through
his
mind
he
trembled
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
he
started
to
his
feet
livid
and
convulsed
already
exclaimed
lord
heathfield
what
is
the
matter
and
he
smiled
a
singular
smile
at
his
friend
he
knew
well
the
effect
of
his
books
sperelli
bowed
elena
gave
him
her
hand
without
rising
her
husband
accompanied
him
to
the
door
where
he
repeated
in
a
low
voice
wo
forget
those
clasps
as
andrea
stood
in
the
portico
he
saw
a
carriage
coming
up
the
drive
a
man
with
a
great
golden
beard
nodded
to
him
from
the
window
it
was
galeazzo
secinaro
in
a
flash
the
recollection
of
the
may
bazaar
came
back
to
him
and
the
episode
of
galeazzo
offering
elena
a
sum
of
money
if
she
would
dry
her
beautiful
hands
all
wet
with
champagne
on
his
beard
he
hurried
through
the
garden
and
out
into
the
street
he
had
a
dull
confused
sense
as
of
some
deafening
noise
going
on
inside
his
head
it
was
an
afternoon
at
the
end
of
april
warm
and
moist
the
sun
appeared
and
disappeared
again
among
the
fleecy
clouds
the
languor
of
the
sirocco
lay
over
rome
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
him
in
the
via
sistina
he
perceived
a
lady
walking
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
trinità
he
recognised
her
as
donna
maria
ferrès
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
five
only
a
minute
or
two
before
the
accustomed
hour
of
meeting
maria
was
assuredly
on
her
way
to
the
palazzo
zuccari
he
hastened
forward
to
join
her
when
he
reached
her
side
he
called
her
by
name
she
started
violently
you
here
i
was
just
going
up
to
you
it
is
five
wants
a
minute
or
two
yet
to
the
hour
i
was
hurrying
on
to
receive
you
forgive
me
you
seem
quite
upset
and
very
pale
where
were
you
coming
from
she
frowned
slightly
regarding
him
fixedly
through
her
veil
my
stables
andrea
replied
meeting
her
look
unblushingly
as
though
he
had
not
a
drop
of
blood
left
to
send
to
his
face
horse
that
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
has
been
hurt
in
the
knee
the
fault
of
the
jockey
and
now
it
will
not
be
able
to
run
in
the
derby
on
sunday
it
has
annoyed
and
upset
me
very
much
please
forgive
me
i
the
time
without
noticing
it
but
it
is
still
a
few
minutes
to
five
does
not
matter
i
am
going
back
they
had
reached
the
piazza
del
trinità
she
stopped
and
held
out
her
hand
a
furrow
still
lingered
between
her
brows
with
all
her
great
sweetness
of
temper
she
occasionally
had
moments
of
angry
impatience
and
petulancy
that
seemed
to
transform
her
into
another
creature
maria
come
be
kind
i
am
going
up
now
to
wait
for
you
go
on
as
far
as
the
gates
of
the
pincio
and
then
come
back
will
you
the
clock
of
the
trinità
de
monti
begun
to
strike
hear
that
he
added
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
well
i
will
come
you
so
much
i
love
you
i
love
you
they
parted
donna
maria
went
on
across
the
piazza
and
into
the
avenue
over
her
head
the
languid
breath
of
the
sirocco
sent
a
broken
murmur
through
the
green
trees
subtle
waves
of
perfume
rose
and
fell
upon
the
warm
damp
breeze
the
clouds
seemed
lower
the
swallows
skimmed
close
to
the
ground
and
in
the
languorous
heaviness
of
the
air
there
was
something
that
melted
the
passionate
heart
of
the
siennese
ever
since
she
had
yielded
to
andrea
persuasions
her
heart
had
been
filled
with
a
happiness
that
was
deeply
fraught
with
fear
all
her
christian
blood
was
on
fire
with
the
hitherto
raptures
of
her
passion
and
froze
with
terror
at
her
sin
her
passion
was
supreme
immense
so
despotic
that
for
hours
sometimes
it
obliterated
all
thought
of
her
child
she
went
so
far
as
to
forget
to
neglect
delfina
and
afterwards
she
would
have
a
sudden
access
of
remorse
of
repentance
of
tenderness
in
which
she
covered
the
astonished
little
girl
face
with
tears
and
kisses
sobbing
in
horrible
despair
as
over
a
corpse
her
whole
being
quickened
at
this
flame
grew
keener
more
acute
acquired
a
marvellous
sensibility
a
sort
of
clairvoyance
a
faculty
of
divination
which
caused
her
endless
torture
hardly
a
deception
of
andrea
but
seemed
to
send
a
shadow
across
her
spirit
she
felt
an
indefinite
sense
of
disquietude
which
sometimes
condensed
itself
into
a
suspicion
and
this
suspicion
would
gnaw
at
her
heart
embittering
kisses
and
caresses
till
it
was
dissipated
by
the
transports
and
ardent
passion
of
her
incomprehensible
lover
she
was
jealous
jealousy
was
her
implacable
tormentor
not
jealousy
of
the
present
but
of
the
past
with
the
cruelty
that
jealous
people
exercise
against
themselves
she
would
have
wished
to
read
the
secrets
of
andrea
memory
to
find
the
traces
left
there
by
former
mistresses
to
know
to
know
the
question
that
most
often
rose
to
her
lips
if
andrea
seemed
moody
and
silent
was
are
you
thinking
about
and
yet
at
the
very
moment
of
asking
the
question
a
shadow
would
cross
her
eyes
and
her
spirit
an
inevitable
rush
of
sadness
would
rise
out
of
her
heart
again
when
he
turned
up
so
unexpectedly
in
the
street
had
she
not
had
an
instinctive
movement
of
suspicion
with
a
flash
of
lucidity
the
idea
had
leapt
into
her
mind
that
andrea
was
coming
from
the
palazzo
barberini
from
lady
heathfield
she
knew
that
andrea
had
been
this
woman
lover
she
knew
that
her
name
was
elena
she
knew
also
that
she
was
the
elena
of
the
inscription
lebe
goethe
distich
rang
painfully
in
her
heart
that
lyric
cry
gave
her
the
measure
of
andrea
love
for
this
most
beautiful
woman
he
must
have
loved
her
boundlessly
walking
slowly
under
the
trees
she
recalled
elena
appearance
in
the
and
the
uneasiness
of
the
old
lover
she
remembered
her
own
terrible
agitation
one
evening
at
the
austrian
embassy
when
the
countess
starnina
said
to
her
seeing
elena
pass
by
do
you
think
of
lady
heathfield
she
was
and
is
still
i
fancy
a
great
flame
of
our
friend
sperelli
still
i
fancy
what
tortures
in
a
single
sentence
she
followed
her
rival
persistently
with
her
eyes
through
the
throng
and
more
than
once
her
gaze
met
that
of
the
other
sending
a
nameless
shiver
through
her
later
on
in
the
evening
when
they
were
introduced
to
one
another
by
the
baroness
bockhorst
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
they
merely
exchanged
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
that
perfunctory
salutation
had
been
repeated
on
the
rare
occasions
on
which
maria
ferrès
had
joined
in
any
social
function
why
should
these
doubts
and
suspicions
beaten
down
and
stifled
under
the
flood
of
her
passion
rise
up
again
now
with
so
much
vehemence
why
had
she
not
the
strength
to
repress
them
or
put
them
away
from
her
altogether
the
least
touch
brought
them
up
to
the
surface
as
lively
as
ever
her
distress
and
unhappiness
increased
with
every
moment
her
heart
was
not
satisfied
the
dream
that
had
risen
up
within
her
on
that
mystical
morning
under
the
flowering
trees
in
sight
of
the
sea
had
not
come
true
all
that
was
purest
and
fairest
in
that
love
had
remained
down
there
in
the
sequestered
glades
in
the
symbolical
forest
that
bloomed
and
bore
fruit
perpetually
in
contemplation
of
the
infinite
she
stood
and
leaned
against
the
parapet
that
looks
towards
san
sebastianello
the
ancient
oaks
their
foliage
so
dark
as
almost
to
seem
black
spread
a
sombre
artificial
roof
over
the
fountain
there
were
great
rents
in
their
trunks
filled
up
with
bricks
and
mortar
like
the
breaches
in
a
wall
oh
the
young
all
radiant
and
breathing
in
the
light
the
fountain
dripping
from
the
higher
into
the
lower
basin
moaned
at
intervals
like
a
heart
that
fills
with
anguish
and
then
overflows
in
a
torrent
of
tears
oh
the
melody
of
the
hundred
fountains
in
the
laurel
avenue
the
city
lay
as
dead
as
if
buried
under
the
ashes
of
an
invisible
volcano
silent
and
funereal
as
a
city
ravaged
by
the
plague
enormous
shapeless
dominated
by
the
cupola
that
rose
out
of
its
bosom
like
a
cloud
oh
the
sea
the
tranquil
sea
her
uneasiness
increased
an
obscure
menace
emanated
from
these
things
she
was
seized
with
the
feeling
of
terror
she
had
already
experienced
on
so
many
occasions
across
her
pious
spirit
there
flashed
once
more
the
thought
of
punishment
nevertheless
the
recollection
that
her
lover
awaited
her
thrilled
her
to
the
heart
core
at
the
thought
of
his
kisses
his
caresses
his
mad
endearments
her
blood
was
on
fire
and
her
soul
grew
faint
the
thrill
of
passion
triumphed
over
the
fear
of
god
she
turned
her
steps
towards
her
lover
house
with
all
the
palpitating
emotion
of
her
first
rendezvous
last
cried
andrea
gathering
her
into
his
arms
and
drinking
the
breath
from
her
panting
lips
he
took
one
of
her
hands
and
held
it
against
his
breast
my
heart
if
you
had
stayed
away
a
minute
longer
it
would
have
broken
but
instead
of
her
hand
she
laid
her
cheek
upon
it
he
kissed
the
white
nape
of
her
neck
you
hear
it
beat
and
it
speaks
to
me
does
it
tell
you
you
do
not
love
me
does
it
tell
you
repeated
the
young
man
biting
her
neck
softly
and
preventing
her
from
raising
her
head
she
laughed
you
love
me
she
removed
her
cloak
her
hat
and
her
gloves
and
then
went
to
smell
the
bouquets
of
white
lilac
that
filled
the
high
florentine
vases
like
those
of
the
in
the
borghese
gallery
her
step
on
the
carpet
was
extraordinarily
light
and
nothing
could
exceed
her
grace
of
attitude
as
she
buried
her
face
in
the
delicate
tassels
of
bloom
she
bit
off
the
end
of
a
spray
and
holding
it
between
her
lips
it
she
said
they
exchanged
a
long
long
kiss
in
among
the
perfume
he
drew
her
closer
and
said
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
andrea
no
let
us
stay
here
i
will
make
the
tea
for
you
she
took
her
lover
hand
and
twined
her
fingers
into
his
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
my
heart
is
so
full
of
love
that
i
could
almost
cry
the
words
trembled
on
her
lips
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
if
only
i
need
not
leave
you
if
i
could
stay
here
always
her
heart
was
so
full
that
it
lent
an
indefinable
sadness
to
her
words
i
think
that
you
can
never
know
the
whole
extent
of
my
love
that
i
can
never
know
yours
do
you
love
me
tell
me
say
it
a
hundred
a
thousand
times
always
you
love
me
if
you
did
not
know
i
do
not
know
she
uttered
the
words
in
so
low
a
tone
that
andrea
hardly
caught
them
she
silently
laid
her
head
on
andrea
breast
waiting
for
him
to
speak
as
if
listening
to
his
heart
he
regarded
that
hapless
head
weighed
down
by
the
burden
of
a
sad
foreboding
he
felt
the
light
pressure
of
that
noble
mournful
brow
upon
his
breast
which
was
hardened
by
falsehood
encased
in
duplicity
as
in
a
cuirass
of
steel
he
was
stirred
by
genuine
emotion
a
sense
of
human
pity
for
this
most
human
suffering
gripped
him
by
the
throat
and
yet
this
agitation
of
soul
resolved
itself
into
lying
words
and
lent
a
quiver
of
seeming
sincerity
to
his
voice
do
not
know
your
voice
was
so
low
that
it
died
away
upon
your
lips
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
something
protested
against
your
words
all
all
the
memories
of
our
love
rose
up
and
protested
against
them
oh
do
not
that
i
love
you
she
remained
leaning
against
him
listening
trembling
recognising
or
fancying
that
she
recognised
in
his
moving
voice
the
accents
of
true
passion
the
accents
that
intoxicated
her
and
that
she
supposed
were
inimitable
and
he
went
on
speaking
almost
in
her
ear
in
the
silence
of
the
room
with
his
hot
breath
on
her
cheek
and
with
pauses
that
were
almost
sweeter
than
words
to
have
one
sole
thought
continually
every
hour
every
moment
not
to
be
able
to
conceive
of
any
happiness
but
the
transcendent
one
that
beams
upon
me
from
your
mere
presence
to
live
throughout
the
day
in
the
anticipation
impatient
restless
fierce
of
the
moment
when
i
shall
see
you
again
and
after
you
have
gone
to
caress
and
cherish
your
image
in
my
heart
to
believe
in
you
alone
to
swear
by
you
alone
in
you
alone
to
put
my
faith
my
strength
my
pride
my
whole
world
all
that
i
dream
and
all
that
i
hope
she
lifted
her
face
all
bathed
in
tears
he
ceased
to
speak
and
with
his
lips
arrested
the
course
of
the
warm
drops
that
flowed
over
her
cheeks
she
wept
and
smiled
caressing
his
hair
with
trembling
hands
shaken
with
irrepressible
sobs
heart
my
dearest
heart
he
made
her
sit
down
and
knelt
before
her
without
ceasing
to
kiss
her
lids
suddenly
he
started
he
had
felt
her
long
lashes
tremble
on
his
lips
like
the
flutter
of
an
airy
wing
time
was
when
elena
had
laughingly
given
him
that
caress
twenty
times
in
succession
maria
had
learned
it
from
him
and
at
that
caress
he
had
often
managed
to
conjure
up
the
image
of
his
start
made
maria
smile
and
as
a
tear
still
lingered
on
her
lashes
one
too
she
said
he
kissed
it
away
and
she
laughed
softly
without
a
thought
of
suspicion
her
tears
had
ceased
and
reassured
she
turned
almost
gay
and
full
of
charming
graces
am
going
to
make
the
tea
now
she
said
stay
where
you
are
the
image
of
elena
had
suddenly
interposed
between
them
let
me
get
up
begged
maria
disengaging
herself
from
his
constraining
arms
want
you
to
taste
my
tea
the
aroma
will
penetrate
to
your
very
soul
she
was
alluding
to
some
costly
tea
she
had
received
from
calcutta
which
she
had
given
to
andrea
the
day
before
she
rose
and
went
over
to
the
with
the
dragons
in
which
the
melting
shades
of
the
di
of
the
ancient
dalmatic
continued
to
languish
exquisitely
the
little
cups
of
fine
majolica
still
glittered
on
the
while
preparing
the
tea
she
said
a
thousand
charming
things
she
let
all
the
goodness
and
tenderness
of
her
fond
heart
bloom
out
with
entire
freedom
she
took
an
ingenuous
delight
in
this
dear
and
secret
intimacy
the
hushed
calm
of
the
room
with
all
its
accessories
of
refined
luxury
behind
her
as
behind
the
virgin
in
botticelli
rose
the
tall
vases
crowned
with
sprays
of
white
lilac
and
her
archangelic
hands
moved
about
among
the
little
mythological
pictures
of
luzio
dolci
and
the
hexameters
of
ovid
beneath
them
are
you
thinking
about
she
asked
andrea
who
was
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
her
leaning
his
head
against
the
arm
of
her
chair
am
listening
to
you
go
on
have
nothing
more
to
say
you
have
tell
me
a
thousand
thousand
things
sort
of
things
things
that
you
alone
know
how
to
say
he
wanted
maria
voice
to
lull
the
anguish
caused
him
by
to
animate
for
him
the
image
of
you
smell
that
she
exclaimed
as
she
poured
the
boiling
water
on
to
the
aromatic
leaves
a
delicious
fragrance
diffused
itself
through
the
air
with
the
steam
i
love
that
she
cried
andrea
shivered
were
not
those
the
very
words
and
spoken
in
her
very
tone
that
elena
had
used
on
the
evening
she
offered
him
her
love
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
maria
mouth
that
again
you
just
said
words
sound
so
sweet
when
you
pronounce
them
you
can
not
understand
it
of
course
say
them
again
she
smiled
divining
nothing
and
a
little
troubled
even
a
little
shy
under
her
lover
strange
gaze
then
i
love
that
me
me
you
she
looked
down
puzzled
at
her
lover
writhing
at
her
feet
his
face
haggard
and
drawn
waiting
for
the
words
he
was
trying
to
draw
out
of
her
me
you
i
love
you
is
it
that
is
it
say
it
again
again
she
did
so
quite
unsuspecting
he
felt
a
spasm
of
inexpressible
pleasure
do
you
shut
your
eyes
she
asked
not
because
of
any
suspicion
in
her
mind
but
to
lead
him
on
to
explain
his
emotion
that
i
may
die
he
laid
his
head
on
her
knee
and
remained
for
some
minutes
in
that
attitude
silent
and
abstracted
she
gently
stroked
his
hair
his
brow
that
brow
behind
which
his
infamous
imagination
was
working
shadows
began
to
fill
the
room
and
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
and
the
aromatic
beverage
mingled
in
the
air
the
outlines
of
the
surrounding
objects
melted
into
one
vague
form
harmonious
dim
unsubstantial
presently
she
said
up
dearest
i
must
go
it
is
getting
late
a
little
longer
with
me
he
entreated
he
drew
her
over
to
the
divan
where
the
gold
on
the
cushions
still
gleamed
through
the
shadows
there
he
suddenly
clasped
her
head
between
his
hands
and
covered
her
face
with
fierce
hot
kisses
he
let
himself
imagine
it
was
the
other
face
he
held
and
he
thought
of
it
as
sullied
by
the
lips
of
her
husband
and
instead
of
disgust
was
filled
with
still
more
savage
desire
of
it
all
the
turbid
sensations
he
had
experienced
in
the
presence
of
this
man
now
rose
to
the
surface
of
his
consciousness
and
with
his
kisses
these
vile
things
swept
over
the
cheeks
the
brow
the
hair
the
throat
the
lips
of
maria
me
go
let
me
go
she
cried
struggling
out
of
his
arms
she
ran
across
to
the
to
light
the
candles
must
be
good
she
said
panting
a
little
still
and
with
an
air
of
fond
reproof
he
did
not
move
from
the
divan
but
looked
at
her
in
silence
she
went
over
to
the
side
of
the
mantelpiece
where
on
the
wall
hung
the
little
old
mirror
she
put
on
her
hat
and
veil
before
its
dim
surface
that
looked
so
like
a
pool
of
dull
and
stagnant
water
am
so
loath
to
leave
you
this
evening
she
murmured
oppressed
by
the
melancholy
of
the
twilight
hour
evening
more
than
ever
before
the
violet
gleam
of
the
sunset
struggled
with
the
light
of
the
candles
the
lilac
in
the
crystal
vases
looked
waxen
white
the
cushion
in
the
retained
the
impress
of
the
form
that
had
leaned
against
it
the
clock
of
the
trinità
began
to
strike
how
late
help
me
to
put
on
my
cloak
exclaimed
the
poor
creature
turning
to
andrea
he
only
clasped
her
once
more
in
his
arms
kissing
her
furiously
blindly
madly
with
a
devouring
passion
stifling
on
her
lips
his
own
insane
desire
to
cry
aloud
the
name
of
elena
at
last
she
managed
to
gasp
in
an
expiring
voice
are
drawing
my
life
out
of
me
but
his
passionate
vehemence
seemed
to
make
her
happy
love
my
soul
all
all
mine
she
said
and
again
blissfully
can
feel
your
heart
beating
so
fast
so
fast
at
last
with
a
sigh
must
go
now
andrea
was
as
lividly
pale
and
convulsed
as
if
he
had
just
committed
a
murder
ails
you
she
asked
with
tender
solicitude
he
tried
to
smile
never
felt
so
profound
an
emotion
he
answered
thought
i
should
have
died
he
took
the
bouquet
of
flowers
from
one
of
the
vases
and
handed
it
to
her
and
went
with
her
towards
the
door
almost
hurrying
her
departure
for
this
woman
every
look
and
gesture
and
word
was
a
fresh
in
his
heart
dear
heart
said
the
hapless
creature
to
him
with
unspeakable
tenderness
of
me
chapter
vii
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
as
andrea
sperelli
was
walking
along
the
corso
in
the
radiant
sunshine
he
heard
his
name
called
from
the
doorway
of
the
club
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
it
was
a
group
of
gentlemen
amusing
themselves
by
watching
the
ladies
pass
and
talking
scandal
they
were
giulio
musellaro
ludovico
barbarisi
the
duke
of
grimiti
galeazzo
secinaro
gino
bomminaco
and
two
or
three
others
you
heard
what
happened
last
night
barbarisi
asked
him
what
manuel
ferrès
the
minister
for
guatemala
caught
cheating
at
cards
sperelli
retained
his
although
some
of
the
men
were
looking
at
him
with
a
certain
malicious
curiosity
was
that
was
there
and
was
playing
at
the
same
table
secinaro
proceeded
to
give
him
the
details
andrea
did
not
affect
indifference
he
listened
with
a
grave
and
attentive
air
at
the
end
of
the
story
he
said
am
extremely
sorry
to
hear
it
after
remaining
a
minute
or
two
longer
with
the
group
he
bowed
and
passed
on
way
are
you
going
asked
secinaro
am
going
home
will
go
with
you
part
of
the
way
they
went
off
together
in
the
direction
of
the
via
de
condotti
the
corso
was
one
glittering
stream
of
sunshine
from
the
piazzo
di
venezia
to
the
piazzo
del
popolo
ladies
in
light
spring
dress
passed
along
by
the
brilliant
the
princess
of
ferentino
with
barbarella
viti
under
one
big
lace
parasol
bianca
dolcebuono
leonetto
young
wife
you
know
this
man
this
ferrès
asked
galeazzo
of
andrea
who
had
not
spoken
as
yet
i
met
him
last
year
at
schifanoja
at
my
cousin
ateleta
the
wife
is
a
great
friend
of
francesca
that
is
why
the
affair
annoys
me
so
much
we
must
see
that
it
is
hushed
up
as
much
as
possible
you
will
be
doing
me
the
greatest
favour
if
you
will
help
me
about
it
galeazzo
promised
his
assistance
with
the
most
cordial
alacrity
think
said
he
the
worst
of
the
scandal
might
be
avoided
if
the
minister
sends
in
his
resignation
to
his
government
without
a
moment
delay
that
is
what
the
president
of
the
club
advised
but
ferrès
refused
last
night
he
blustered
and
did
the
insulted
and
yet
the
proofs
were
there
as
clear
as
daylight
he
will
have
to
be
persuaded
they
continued
on
the
subject
as
they
walked
along
sperelli
was
grateful
to
secinaro
for
his
assistance
and
the
intimate
tone
of
the
conversation
predisposed
secinaro
to
friendly
confidences
at
the
corner
of
the
via
de
condotti
they
caught
sight
of
lady
heathfield
strolling
along
the
left
side
of
the
street
past
the
japanese
with
her
undulating
rhythmic
captivating
walk
donna
elena
said
galeazzo
both
the
men
watched
her
and
both
felt
the
glamour
of
that
rhythmic
gait
when
they
came
up
to
her
they
both
bowed
but
passed
on
they
no
longer
saw
her
but
she
saw
them
and
for
andrea
it
was
a
form
of
torture
to
have
to
walk
beside
a
rival
under
the
gaze
of
the
woman
he
desired
and
feel
that
those
piercing
eyes
were
perhaps
taking
a
delight
in
weighing
the
merits
of
both
men
he
compared
himself
with
secinaro
galeazzo
was
of
the
bovine
type
a
lucius
verus
with
golden
hair
and
blue
eyes
while
amid
the
magnificent
abundance
of
his
golden
beard
shone
a
full
red
mouth
handsome
but
without
the
slightest
expression
he
was
tall
and
strong
with
an
air
of
elegance
that
was
not
exactly
refined
but
easy
and
unaffected
sperelli
asked
goaded
on
by
a
sort
of
madness
matters
going
on
favourably
he
knew
he
might
adopt
this
tone
with
a
man
of
this
sort
galeazzo
turned
and
looked
at
him
half
surprised
half
suspicious
he
certainly
did
not
expect
such
a
question
from
him
and
still
less
the
airy
and
perfectly
calm
tone
in
which
the
question
was
uttered
the
time
that
siege
of
mine
has
lasted
groaned
the
bearded
prince
simply
i
have
tried
every
kind
of
manoeuvre
but
always
without
success
i
always
came
too
late
some
other
fellow
had
always
been
before
me
in
storming
the
citadel
but
i
never
lost
heart
i
was
convinced
that
sooner
or
later
my
turn
would
come
pour
and
sure
enough
heathfield
is
kinder
to
me
than
the
duchess
of
scerni
i
shall
have
i
hope
the
very
enviable
honour
of
being
set
down
after
you
on
the
list
he
burst
into
a
rather
coarse
laugh
showing
his
splendid
teeth
fancy
that
my
doughty
deeds
in
india
which
giulio
musellaro
spread
abroad
have
added
to
my
beard
several
heroic
strands
of
irresistible
virtue
just
in
these
days
that
beard
of
yours
should
fairly
quiver
with
memories
memories
of
a
bacchic
nature
do
understand
have
you
forgotten
the
famous
may
bazaar
of
upon
my
word
now
that
you
remind
me
of
it
the
third
anniversary
does
fall
on
one
of
these
next
days
but
you
were
not
there
who
told
you
want
to
know
more
than
is
good
for
you
my
dear
boy
tell
me
your
mind
rather
to
making
the
most
skilful
use
of
this
anniversary
and
give
me
news
as
soon
as
you
have
any
shall
i
see
you
again
you
like
dine
with
me
at
the
club
about
eight
that
will
give
us
an
opportunity
of
seeing
after
the
other
affair
too
right
goldbeard
run
they
parted
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
as
elena
came
across
the
square
in
the
direction
of
the
via
due
macelli
to
go
up
to
the
quattro
fontane
secinaro
joined
her
and
walked
on
with
her
the
strain
of
dissimulation
once
over
andrea
heart
sank
within
him
like
a
leaden
weight
he
did
not
know
how
he
was
to
drag
himself
up
the
steps
he
was
quite
assured
that
after
this
secinaro
would
tell
him
everything
and
somehow
this
seemed
to
him
a
point
to
his
advantage
by
a
sort
of
intoxication
a
species
of
madness
resulting
from
the
severity
of
his
sufferings
he
rushed
blindly
into
new
and
ever
more
cruel
and
senseless
torments
aggravating
and
complicating
his
miserable
state
in
a
thousand
ways
passing
from
perversion
to
perversion
from
aberration
to
aberration
without
being
able
to
hold
back
or
to
stop
for
one
moment
in
his
giddy
descent
he
seemed
to
be
devoured
by
an
inextinguishable
fever
the
heat
of
which
made
all
the
germs
of
human
lust
lying
dormant
in
the
hidden
depths
of
his
being
flourish
and
grow
big
his
every
thought
his
every
emotion
showed
the
same
stain
and
yet
it
was
the
very
deception
itself
that
bound
him
so
strongly
to
the
woman
he
deceived
his
mind
had
adapted
itself
so
thoroughly
to
the
monstrous
comedy
that
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
conceiving
any
other
way
of
satisfying
his
passion
this
incarnation
of
one
woman
in
another
was
no
longer
a
result
of
exasperated
desire
but
a
deliberate
habit
of
vice
and
now
finally
an
imperious
necessity
from
thenceforth
the
unconscious
instrument
of
his
vicious
imagination
had
become
as
necessary
to
him
as
the
vice
itself
by
a
process
of
sensual
depravity
he
had
almost
come
to
think
that
the
real
possession
of
elena
would
not
afford
him
such
exquisite
and
violent
delight
as
the
imaginary
he
was
hardly
able
to
separate
the
two
women
in
his
thoughts
and
just
as
he
felt
that
his
pleasure
would
be
diminished
by
the
actual
possession
of
the
one
so
his
nerves
received
a
shock
if
by
some
lassitude
of
the
imagination
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
other
without
the
interposing
image
of
her
rival
thus
he
felt
crushed
to
the
earth
at
the
thought
that
don
manuel
ruin
meant
for
him
the
loss
of
maria
when
she
came
to
him
that
evening
he
saw
at
once
that
the
poor
thing
was
ignorant
as
yet
of
her
misfortune
but
the
next
day
she
arrived
panting
convulsed
pale
as
death
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
hid
her
face
on
his
breast
know
she
gasped
between
her
sobs
the
news
had
spread
disgrace
and
ruin
were
inevitable
irremediable
there
followed
days
of
hideous
torture
during
which
maria
left
alone
after
the
precipitate
flight
of
the
gamester
abandoned
by
the
few
friends
she
possessed
persecuted
by
the
innumerable
creditors
of
her
husband
bewildered
by
the
legal
formalities
of
the
seizure
of
their
effects
by
bailiffs
and
rogues
of
all
sorts
gave
evidences
of
a
courage
that
was
nothing
less
than
heroic
but
failed
to
avert
the
utter
ruin
that
overwhelmed
the
family
from
her
lover
she
would
receive
no
assistance
of
any
kind
she
told
him
nothing
of
the
martyrdom
she
was
enduring
even
when
he
reproached
her
for
the
brevity
of
her
visits
she
never
complained
for
him
she
always
managed
to
call
up
a
less
mournful
smile
still
obeyed
the
dictates
of
her
lover
capricious
passion
and
lavished
upon
her
ruthless
destroyer
all
the
treasures
of
her
fond
heart
her
presentiments
had
not
deceived
her
everything
was
falling
in
ruins
around
her
punishment
had
overtaken
her
without
a
moment
warning
but
she
never
regretted
having
yielded
to
her
lover
never
repented
having
given
herself
so
utterly
to
him
never
bewailed
her
lost
purity
her
one
sorrow
stronger
than
remorse
or
fear
or
any
other
trouble
of
mind
was
the
thought
that
she
must
go
away
must
be
separated
from
this
man
who
was
the
life
of
her
life
darling
i
shall
die
i
am
going
away
to
die
far
from
you
alone
all
alone
and
you
will
not
be
there
to
close
my
eyes
she
smiled
as
she
spoke
with
certainty
and
resignation
but
andrea
endeavoured
to
kindle
an
illusive
hope
in
her
breast
to
sow
in
her
heart
the
seeds
of
a
dream
that
could
only
lead
to
future
suffering
will
not
let
you
die
you
will
be
mine
again
and
for
a
long
time
to
come
we
have
many
happy
days
of
love
before
us
yet
he
spoke
of
the
immediate
he
would
go
and
establish
himself
in
florence
from
there
he
could
go
over
as
often
as
he
liked
to
sienna
under
the
pretext
of
study
could
pass
whole
months
there
copying
some
old
master
or
making
researches
in
ancient
chronicles
their
love
should
have
its
hidden
nest
in
some
deserted
street
or
beyond
the
city
in
the
country
in
some
villa
decorated
with
rural
ornaments
and
surrounded
by
a
meadow
she
would
be
able
to
spare
an
hour
now
and
then
for
their
love
sometimes
she
would
come
and
spend
a
whole
week
in
florence
a
week
of
unbroken
happiness
they
would
air
their
idyll
on
the
hillside
of
fiesole
in
a
september
as
mild
as
april
and
the
cypresses
of
montughi
would
not
be
less
kind
to
them
than
the
cypresses
of
schifanoja
it
were
true
would
it
were
true
sighed
maria
do
believe
me
yes
i
believe
you
but
my
heart
tells
me
that
all
these
sweet
things
will
remain
a
dream
she
made
andrea
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
there
for
a
long
time
and
she
leaned
upon
his
breast
silently
crouching
into
his
embrace
as
if
to
hide
herself
with
the
shiver
of
a
sick
person
or
of
one
who
seeks
protection
from
some
threatening
danger
she
asked
of
andrea
only
the
delicate
caresses
that
in
the
language
of
affection
she
called
of
the
soul
and
that
melted
her
to
tears
sweeter
than
any
more
carnal
delights
she
could
not
understand
how
in
these
moments
of
supreme
spirituality
in
these
last
sad
hours
of
passion
and
farewell
her
lover
was
not
content
to
kiss
her
hands
no
dear
love
she
besought
him
half
repelled
by
andrea
crude
display
of
passion
feel
that
you
are
nearer
to
me
closer
to
my
heart
more
entirely
one
with
me
when
you
are
sitting
at
my
side
and
take
my
hand
in
yours
and
look
into
my
eyes
and
say
the
things
to
me
that
you
alone
know
how
to
say
those
other
caresses
seem
to
put
us
far
away
from
each
other
to
set
some
shadow
between
you
and
me
i
know
how
to
express
my
thought
properly
and
afterwards
it
leaves
me
so
sad
so
sad
i
do
know
what
it
is
i
feel
then
so
tired
but
a
tiredness
that
has
something
evil
about
it
she
entreated
him
humbly
submissively
fearing
to
make
him
angry
then
she
fell
to
recalling
memories
of
things
recent
and
passed
down
to
the
smallest
details
the
most
trivial
words
the
most
insignificant
facts
which
all
had
a
vast
amount
of
significance
for
her
but
it
was
towards
the
first
days
of
her
stay
at
schifanoja
that
her
heart
returned
most
fondly
remember
you
remember
and
suddenly
the
tears
filled
her
downcast
eyes
one
evening
andrea
thinking
of
her
husband
asked
her
i
knew
you
have
you
always
been
mine
am
not
speaking
of
the
soul
yes
always
wholly
yours
and
he
who
had
never
before
believed
one
of
his
mistresses
on
this
point
believed
maria
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
her
assertion
he
believed
her
even
while
he
deceived
and
profaned
her
without
remorse
he
knew
himself
to
be
boundlessly
loved
by
a
lofty
and
noble
spirit
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
grand
and
passion
and
recognised
fully
both
the
grandeur
of
that
passion
and
his
own
vileness
and
yet
under
the
lash
of
his
base
imaginings
he
would
go
so
far
as
to
hurt
the
mouth
of
the
fond
and
patient
creature
to
prevent
himself
from
crying
aloud
upon
her
lips
the
name
that
rose
invincibly
to
his
and
that
loving
and
pathetic
mouth
would
murmur
all
unconscious
smiling
though
it
bled
thus
you
do
not
hurt
me
chapter
viii
it
wanted
but
a
few
days
now
to
their
parting
miss
dorothy
had
taken
delfina
to
sienna
and
then
returned
to
help
her
mistress
in
the
last
and
most
trying
arrangements
and
to
accompany
her
on
the
journey
in
the
mother
house
in
sienna
the
truth
of
the
story
was
not
known
and
delfina
of
course
knew
nothing
maria
had
merely
written
that
don
manuel
had
been
suddenly
recalled
by
his
government
and
she
made
ready
to
go
to
leave
these
rooms
so
full
of
cherished
things
to
the
hands
of
the
public
auctioneers
who
had
already
drawn
up
the
inventory
and
fixed
the
date
of
the
sale
for
the
of
june
at
ten
in
the
morning
on
the
evening
of
the
as
she
was
leaving
andrea
she
missed
a
glove
while
looking
for
it
she
came
upon
a
volume
of
shelley
the
one
which
andrea
had
lent
her
in
schifanoja
the
dear
and
affecting
book
in
which
before
the
excursion
to
vicomile
she
had
underlined
the
words
forget
me
for
i
can
be
thine
she
took
up
the
book
with
visible
emotion
and
turned
over
the
pages
till
she
came
to
the
one
which
bore
the
mark
of
her
underlining
she
murmured
with
a
shake
of
the
head
remember
and
hardly
eight
months
have
passed
since
she
pensively
turned
over
a
few
more
leaves
and
read
other
verses
is
our
poet
she
went
on
often
you
promised
to
take
me
to
the
english
cemetery
you
remember
we
were
to
take
flowers
for
his
grave
shall
we
go
you
might
take
me
before
i
leave
it
will
be
our
last
walk
together
us
go
he
answered
the
next
evening
when
the
sun
was
already
declining
they
went
in
a
closed
carriage
on
her
knees
lay
a
bunch
of
roses
they
drove
along
the
foot
of
the
leafy
aventino
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
boats
laden
with
sicilian
wine
anchored
in
the
port
of
ripa
grande
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
cemetery
they
left
the
carriage
and
went
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
gates
on
foot
and
in
silence
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
maria
felt
that
not
only
was
she
here
to
lay
flowers
on
the
tomb
of
a
poet
but
that
in
this
place
of
death
she
would
weep
for
something
of
herself
irreparably
lost
a
of
shelley
read
in
the
sleepless
watches
of
the
night
echoed
through
her
spirit
as
she
gazed
at
the
cypresses
pointing
to
the
sky
on
the
other
side
of
the
white
wall
is
here
and
death
is
there
death
is
busy
everywhere
all
around
within
beneath
above
is
death
and
we
are
death
death
has
set
his
mark
and
seal
on
all
we
are
and
all
we
feel
on
all
we
know
and
all
we
fear
first
our
pleasures
die
and
then
our
hopes
and
then
our
fears
and
when
these
are
dead
the
debt
is
due
dust
claims
dust
and
we
die
too
all
things
that
we
love
and
cherish
like
ourselves
must
fade
and
perish
such
is
our
rude
mortal
lot
love
itself
would
did
they
not
as
she
passed
through
the
gateway
she
put
her
arm
through
andrea
and
shivered
the
cemetery
was
solitary
and
deserted
a
few
gardeners
were
engaged
in
watering
the
plants
along
by
the
wall
swinging
their
from
side
to
side
with
an
even
and
continuous
motion
and
in
silence
the
funeral
cypresses
stood
up
straight
and
motionless
in
the
air
only
their
tops
gilded
by
the
sun
trembled
lightly
between
the
rigid
trunks
rose
the
white
tombs
square
slabs
of
stone
broken
pillars
urns
sarcophagi
from
the
sombre
mass
of
the
cypresses
fell
a
mysterious
shadow
a
religious
peace
a
sort
of
human
kindness
as
limpid
and
beneficent
waters
gush
from
the
hard
rock
the
unchanging
regularity
of
the
trees
and
the
chastened
whiteness
of
the
sepulchral
monuments
affected
the
spirit
with
a
sense
of
solemn
and
sweet
repose
but
between
the
stiff
ranks
of
the
trees
standing
in
line
like
the
deep
pipes
of
an
organ
and
interspersed
among
the
tombs
graceful
oleanders
swayed
their
tufts
of
pink
blossom
roses
dropped
their
petals
at
every
light
touch
of
the
breeze
strewing
the
ground
with
their
fragrant
snow
the
eucalyptus
shook
its
pale
tresses
now
dark
now
silvery
white
willows
wept
over
the
crosses
and
crowns
and
here
and
there
the
cactus
displayed
the
glory
of
its
white
blooms
like
a
swarm
of
sleeping
butterflies
or
an
aigrette
of
wonderful
feathers
the
silence
was
unbroken
save
by
the
cry
now
and
then
of
some
solitary
bird
andrea
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
hill
poet
tomb
is
up
there
he
said
that
ruin
to
the
left
just
below
the
last
tower
she
dropped
his
arm
and
went
on
in
front
of
him
through
the
narrow
paths
bordered
with
low
myrtle
hedges
she
walked
as
if
fatigued
turning
round
every
few
minutes
to
smile
back
at
her
lover
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
wore
a
black
veil
that
cast
over
her
faint
and
trembling
smile
a
shadow
of
mourning
her
oval
chin
was
paler
and
purer
than
the
roses
she
carried
in
her
hand
once
as
she
turned
one
of
the
roses
shed
its
petals
on
the
path
andrea
stooped
to
pick
them
up
she
looked
at
him
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
he
exclaimed
a
scene
rose
up
before
her
vividly
as
a
picture
remember
she
said
morning
at
schifanoja
when
i
threw
a
handful
of
leaves
down
to
you
from
the
higher
terrace
you
bent
your
knee
to
me
while
i
descended
the
steps
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
but
that
time
seems
to
me
so
near
and
yet
so
far
away
i
feel
as
if
it
had
happened
yesterday
and
then
again
a
century
ago
but
perhaps
after
all
it
only
happened
in
a
dream
passing
along
between
the
low
myrtle
hedges
they
at
last
reached
the
tower
near
which
lies
the
tomb
of
the
poet
and
of
trelawny
the
jasmin
climbing
over
the
old
ruin
was
in
flower
but
of
the
violets
nothing
was
left
but
their
thick
carpet
of
leaves
the
tops
of
the
cypresses
which
here
just
reached
the
line
of
vision
were
vividly
illumined
by
the
last
red
gleams
of
the
sun
as
it
sank
behind
the
black
cross
of
the
monte
testaccio
a
great
purple
cloud
edged
with
burning
gold
sailed
across
the
sky
in
the
direction
of
the
aventino
are
two
friends
whose
lives
were
undivided
so
let
their
memory
be
now
they
have
glided
under
their
grave
let
not
their
bones
be
parted
for
their
two
hearts
in
life
were
maria
repeated
the
last
line
then
moved
by
a
delicate
inspiration
unfasten
my
veil
she
said
to
andrea
she
leaned
her
head
back
slightly
so
that
he
might
untie
the
knot
and
andrea
fingers
touched
her
hair
that
magnificent
hair
in
the
dense
shadow
of
which
he
had
so
often
tasted
all
the
delights
of
his
perfidious
imagination
evoked
the
image
of
her
rival
you
she
said
she
then
drew
the
veil
from
before
her
face
and
looked
at
andrea
with
eyes
that
were
a
little
dazed
she
looked
very
beautiful
the
shadows
round
her
eyes
were
darker
and
deeper
but
the
eyes
themselves
burned
with
a
more
intense
light
her
hair
clung
to
her
temples
in
heavy
hyacinthine
curls
tinged
with
violet
the
middle
of
her
forehead
which
was
left
free
gleamed
by
contrast
in
moonlike
purity
her
features
had
fined
down
and
lost
something
of
their
materiality
through
stress
of
love
and
sorrow
she
wound
the
veil
about
the
stems
of
the
roses
tied
the
two
ends
together
with
much
care
and
then
buried
her
face
in
the
flowers
inhaling
their
perfume
then
she
laid
them
on
the
simple
stone
that
bears
the
poet
name
engraved
upon
it
there
was
an
indefinable
expression
in
the
gesture
which
andrea
could
not
understand
as
they
moved
away
he
suddenly
stopped
short
and
looking
back
towards
the
tower
did
you
manage
to
get
those
roses
he
asked
she
smiled
but
her
eyes
were
wet
are
yours
those
of
that
snowy
night
they
have
bloomed
again
this
evening
do
you
not
believe
it
the
evening
breeze
was
rising
and
behind
the
hill
the
sky
was
overspread
with
gold
in
the
midst
of
which
the
purple
cloud
dissolved
as
if
consumed
by
fire
against
this
field
of
light
the
serried
ranks
of
the
cypresses
looked
more
imposing
and
mysterious
than
before
the
psyche
at
the
end
of
the
middle
avenue
seemed
to
flush
with
pale
tints
as
of
flesh
a
crescent
moon
rose
over
the
pyramid
of
cestius
in
a
deep
and
glassy
sky
like
the
waters
of
a
calm
and
sheltered
bay
they
went
through
the
centre
avenue
to
the
gates
the
gardeners
were
still
watering
the
plants
and
two
other
men
held
a
velvet
and
silver
pall
by
the
two
ends
and
were
beating
it
vigorously
while
the
dust
rose
high
and
glittered
in
the
air
from
the
aventine
came
the
sound
of
bells
maria
clung
to
her
lover
arm
unable
to
control
her
anguish
feeling
the
ground
give
way
beneath
her
feet
her
life
ebb
from
her
at
every
step
once
inside
the
carriage
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
sobbing
despairingly
on
her
lover
shoulder
shall
die
but
she
did
not
die
better
a
thousand
times
for
her
that
she
had
chapter
ix
two
days
after
this
andrea
was
lunching
with
galeazzo
secinaro
at
a
table
in
the
caffé
di
roma
it
was
a
hot
morning
the
place
was
almost
empty
the
waiters
nodded
drowsily
among
the
buzzing
flies
so
the
bearded
prince
went
on
that
she
had
a
fancy
for
strange
and
situations
i
had
the
courage
to
he
was
relating
in
the
crudest
terms
the
extremely
audacious
means
by
which
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
overcoming
lady
resistance
he
exhibited
neither
reserve
nor
scruples
omitting
no
single
detail
and
praising
the
acquisition
to
the
connoisseur
he
only
broke
off
from
time
to
time
to
put
his
fork
into
a
piece
of
juicy
red
meat
or
to
empty
a
glass
of
red
wine
his
whole
bearing
was
expressive
of
robust
health
and
strength
andrea
sperelli
lit
a
cigarette
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
swallow
a
mouthful
of
food
and
with
the
wine
secinaro
poured
out
for
him
he
seemed
to
be
drinking
poison
there
came
a
moment
at
last
when
the
prince
in
spite
of
his
obtuseness
had
a
qualm
of
doubt
and
he
looked
sharply
at
former
lover
except
his
want
of
appetite
andrea
gave
no
outward
sign
of
inward
agitation
with
the
utmost
calm
he
puffed
clouds
of
smoke
into
the
air
and
smiled
his
habitual
smile
at
his
jocund
companion
the
prince
continued
is
coming
to
see
me
for
the
first
time
you
at
three
the
two
men
looked
at
their
watches
we
go
asked
andrea

together
i
want
to
get
some
flowers
as
you
know
all
about
it
tell
me
what
flowers
does
she
like
best
andrea
laughed
an
abominable
answer
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
he
restrained
himself
and
replied
unmoved
at
one
time
in
front
of
the
barcaccia
they
parted
at
that
hour
the
piazza
di
spagna
had
the
deserted
look
of
high
summer
some
workmen
were
repairing
a
main
and
a
heap
of
earth
dried
by
the
sun
threw
up
clouds
of
dust
in
the
hot
breath
of
the
wind
the
stairway
of
the
trinità
gleamed
white
and
deserted
slowly
slowly
andrea
went
up
standing
still
every
two
or
three
steps
as
if
he
were
dragging
a
terrible
weight
after
him
he
went
into
his
rooms
and
threw
himself
on
his
bed
where
he
remained
till
a
quarter
to
three
at
a
quarter
to
three
he
got
up
and
went
out
he
turned
into
the
via
sistina
on
through
the
via
quattro
fontane
passed
the
palazzo
barberini
and
stopped
before
a
to
wait
for
three
the
bookseller
a
little
wrinkled
old
man
like
a
decrepit
tortoise
offered
him
books
taking
down
his
choicest
volumes
one
by
one
and
spreading
them
out
under
his
eyes
speaking
all
the
time
in
an
insufferable
nasal
monotone
three
would
strike
directly
andrea
looked
at
the
titles
of
the
books
keeping
an
eye
on
the
gates
of
the
palace
while
the
voice
of
the
bookseller
mingled
confusedly
with
the
loud
thumping
of
his
heart
a
lady
passed
through
the
gates
went
down
the
street
towards
the
piazza
got
into
a
cab
and
drove
away
through
the
via
del
tritone
andrea
went
home
there
he
threw
himself
once
more
on
his
bed
and
waited
till
maria
should
come
keeping
himself
in
a
state
of
such
complete
immobility
that
he
seemed
not
to
be
suffering
any
more
at
five
maria
came
you
know
she
said
panting
can
stay
with
you
the
whole
evening
till
it
will
be
our
first
and
last
night
of
love
i
am
going
on
tuesday
she
sobbed
despairingly
and
clung
to
him
her
lips
pressed
convulsively
to
his
let
me
see
the
light
of
another
day
kill
me
she
moaned
then
catching
sight
of
his
discomposed
face
are
suffering
she
exclaimed
too
you
think
we
shall
never
meet
again
he
had
almost
insuperable
difficulty
in
speaking
in
answering
her
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
the
words
failed
him
he
had
an
instinctive
desire
to
hide
his
face
from
those
observant
eyes
to
avoid
her
questions
at
all
cost
he
was
neither
capable
of
consoling
her
nor
of
practising
fresh
deceptions
he
whispered
in
a
choking
almost
irrecognisable
voice
crouching
at
her
feet
he
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
and
remained
like
that
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
while
she
laid
her
tender
hands
upon
his
temples
and
felt
the
wild
irregular
beating
of
his
arteries
she
realised
that
he
was
suffering
fiercely
and
in
his
pain
forgot
all
thought
of
her
own
grieving
now
only
for
his
grief
only
for
him
presently
he
rose
and
clasped
her
with
such
mad
vehemence
to
him
that
she
was
frightened
has
come
to
you
what
is
it
she
cried
trying
to
look
in
his
eyes
to
discover
the
reason
of
his
sudden
frenzy
but
he
only
buried
his
face
deeper
in
her
bosom
her
neck
her
hair
anywhere
out
of
sight
all
at
once
she
struggled
free
of
his
embrace
her
whole
form
convulsed
with
horror
her
face
ghastly
and
distraught
as
if
she
had
at
that
moment
torn
herself
from
the
arms
of
death
that
name
that
name
she
had
heard
that
name
a
deep
and
awful
silence
fell
upon
her
soul
and
in
it
there
suddenly
opened
one
of
those
great
gulfs
into
which
the
whole
universe
seems
to
be
hurled
at
the
touch
of
one
thought
she
heard
nothing
more
andrea
might
writhe
and
supplicate
and
despair
as
he
would
in
vain
she
heard
nothing
some
instinct
directed
her
actions
she
found
her
things
and
put
them
on
andrea
lay
upon
the
floor
sobbing
frenzied
mad
he
was
conscious
that
she
was
preparing
to
leave
the
room
maria
he
listened
he
only
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
closing
behind
her
she
was
gone
chapter
x
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
june
the
sale
began
of
the
furniture
and
hangings
belonging
to
his
excellency
the
minister
plenipotentiary
for
guatemala
it
was
a
burning
hot
morning
summer
blazed
already
over
rome
up
and
down
the
via
nationale
ran
the
drawn
by
horses
with
funny
white
caps
over
their
heads
to
protect
them
against
the
sun
long
lines
of
carts
encumbered
the
road
while
the
blare
of
trumpets
mingled
with
the
cracking
of
whips
and
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
carters
andrea
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
cross
the
threshold
of
that
house
but
wandered
about
the
street
a
long
time
weighed
down
by
a
horrible
sense
of
lassitude
a
lassitude
so
overwhelming
and
desperate
as
to
be
almost
a
physical
longing
for
death
at
last
seeing
a
porter
come
out
of
the
house
with
a
piece
of
furniture
on
his
shoulder
he
decided
to
go
in
he
ran
rapidly
up
the
stairs
from
the
landing
already
he
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
the
sale
was
going
on
in
the
largest
room
of
the
suite
the
one
in
which
the
buddha
had
stood
the
buyers
were
gathered
round
the
table
they
were
for
the
most
part
shopkeepers
furniture
dealers
and
the
lower
classes
generally
there
being
little
competition
in
summer
when
town
was
empty
the
dealers
rushed
in
sure
of
obtaining
costly
articles
for
next
to
nothing
a
vile
odour
permeated
the
hot
air
exhaled
by
the
crowd
of
dirty
and
perspiring
people
andrea
felt
stifled
he
wandered
into
the
other
rooms
where
nothing
had
been
left
but
the
wall
hangings
the
curtains
and
the
portières
the
other
things
having
been
collected
in
the
sale
room
although
he
was
walking
on
a
thick
carpet
he
heard
his
footsteps
as
distinctly
as
if
the
boards
had
been
bare
he
found
himself
presently
in
a
semicircular
room
the
walls
were
deep
red
with
here
and
there
a
sparkle
of
gold
giving
the
impression
of
a
temple
or
a
tomb
a
sad
and
mysterious
sanctuary
fit
for
praying
in
or
for
dying
the
crude
hard
light
blazing
in
through
the
open
windows
seemed
like
a
violation
he
returned
to
the
auction
room
again
he
breathed
the
nauseating
atmosphere
he
turned
round
and
in
a
corner
of
the
room
perceived
the
princess
of
ferentino
and
barbarella
viti
he
bowed
and
went
over
to
them
ugenta
what
have
you
bought
why
i
should
have
thought
you
would
buy
everything
why
it
was
just
an
idea
of
mine
a
romantic
idea
the
princess
laughed
and
barbarella
joined
in
are
going
it
is
impossible
to
stay
any
longer
in
this
perfume
ugenta
console
yourself
andrea
went
to
the
auctioneer
table
the
man
recognised
him
the
signor
conte
wish
for
anything
in
particular
will
see
andrea
answered
the
sale
proceeded
rapidly
he
looked
about
him
at
the
low
faces
of
the
dealers
felt
their
elbows
pushing
him
their
feet
touching
his
their
horrid
breath
upon
him
nausea
gripped
his
throat
going
gone
the
stroke
of
the
hammer
rang
like
a
knell
through
his
heart
and
set
his
temples
throbbing
painfully
he
bought
the
buddha
a
great
carved
cabinet
some
china
some
pieces
of
drapery
presently
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
and
the
rustle
of
feminine
skirts
he
turned
round
to
see
galeazzo
secinaro
entering
accompanied
by
lady
heathfield
and
followed
by
the
countess
lucoli
gino
bomminaco
and
giovanella
daddi
they
were
all
laughing
and
talking
noisily
he
did
his
best
to
conceal
himself
from
them
in
the
crowd
that
besieged
the
auctioneer
table
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
being
discovered
their
voices
and
laughter
reached
him
over
the
heads
of
the
perspiring
people
through
the
suffocating
heat
fortunately
the
gay
party
very
soon
afterwards
took
themselves
off
he
forced
himself
a
passage
through
the
closely
packed
bodies
repressing
his
disgust
as
well
as
he
could
and
making
the
most
tremendous
efforts
to
ward
off
the
faintness
that
threatened
to
overcome
him
there
was
a
bitter
and
sickening
taste
in
his
mouth
he
felt
that
from
the
contact
of
all
these
unclean
people
he
was
carrying
away
with
him
the
germs
of
obscure
and
irremediable
diseases
physical
torture
mingled
with
his
moral
anguish
when
he
got
down
into
the
street
in
the
full
blaze
of
he
had
a
touch
of
giddiness
with
an
unsteady
step
he
set
off
in
search
of
a
cab
he
found
one
in
the
piazza
del
quirinale
and
drove
straight
home
towards
evening
however
a
wild
desire
came
over
him
to
revisit
those
dismantled
rooms
he
went
upstairs
and
entered
on
the
pretext
of
asking
if
the
furniture
he
had
bought
had
been
sent
away
yet
a
man
answered
him
the
things
had
just
gone
the
signor
conte
must
have
passed
them
on
his
way
here
hardly
anything
remained
in
the
rooms
the
crimson
splendour
of
the
setting
sun
gleamed
through
the
curtainless
windows
and
mingled
with
the
noises
of
the
street
some
men
were
taking
down
the
hangings
from
the
walls
disclosing
a
paper
with
great
vulgar
flowers
torn
here
and
there
and
hanging
in
strips
others
were
engaged
in
taking
up
and
rolling
the
carpets
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
that
glittered
in
the
sunlight
one
of
them
sang
scraps
of
a
lewd
song
dust
and
mingled
and
rose
to
the
ceiling
andrea
fled
in
the
piazza
del
quirinale
a
brass
band
was
playing
in
front
of
the
royal
palace
great
waves
of
metallic
music
spread
through
the
glowing
air
the
obelisk
the
fountain
the
statues
looked
enormous
and
seemed
to
glow
as
if
impregnated
with
flame
rome
immense
and
dominated
by
a
battle
of
clouds
seemed
to
illumine
the
sky
andrea
fled
through
the
via
del
quirinale
past
the
quattro
fontane
and
the
gates
of
the
palazzo
barberini
with
its
many
flashing
windows
and
at
last
reached
the
cassa
zuccari
there
the
porters
were
just
taking
his
purchases
off
a
cart
vociferating
loudly
several
of
them
were
carrying
the
cabinet
up
the
stairs
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
he
went
in
as
the
cabinet
occupied
the
whole
width
of
the
staircase
he
could
not
pass
so
he
had
to
follow
it
slowly
slowly
step
by
step
