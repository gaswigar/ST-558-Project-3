francis
charles
metternich
the

for
me
i
do
admit
his
father
reigned
the

i
do
metternich
so
i
do
nothing
for
the
duke
yet
the
attaché
yet
metternich
yet
should
you
give
too
loose
a
reign
to
freedom
permit
yourself
the
slightest
propaganda
let
monsieur
come
too
often
and
bare
his
bosom
to
your
king
in
short
if
your
new
kingdom
too
republican
we
might
our
temper
not
angelical
we
might
remember
francis
is
our
grandson
the

our
lilies
never
shall
turn
red
metternich
and
while
they
keep
their
whiteness
bees

feared
in
spite
of
you
the

may
hope
metternich
no
the
attaché
things
are
happening
metternich
but
we
filter
them
the
attaché
does
he
know
that
france
has
changed
her
king
metternich
yes
but
the
detail
he
does
not
yet
know
is
that
his
father
flag
the
tricolor
is
be
time
enough
the
attaché
he
would
be
drunk
with
hope
metternich
we
keep
him

so
strictly
guarded

and
dreaming
of
ideals
who

i
how

at

it
very
hard
to

i

of
thing
is
all
contemporary

carbonaro
at

always
bored
i
wear
red
waistcoats
and
that
amuses
me
at
tying

once

very
good
indeed
that
why
they
sent
me
here
to
play
the
tailor
i
add
to
make
the
picture
quite
complete
that
i
a
liberal
and
a
my
life
and
dagger
are
at
your
command
the
duke
i
like
you
sir
although
your
talk
is
crazy
the
young
man
you
must
not
judge
me
by
my
whirling
words
the
itch
of
notoriety
consumes
me
but
the
disease
beneath
is
very
real
and
makes
me
seek
forgetfulness
in
danger
the
duke
disease
the
young
man
a
shuddering
disgust
the
duke
your
soul
heavy
with
foiled
ambitions
the
young
man
dull
disquiet
the
duke
morbid
enjoyment
of
our
sufferings
and
pride
in
showing
off
our
pallid
brows
the
young
man
my
lord
the
duke
contempt
for
those
who
live
content
the
young
man
my
lord
the
duke
and
doubt
the
young
man
in
what
mysterious
volume
has
one
so
young
learnt
all
the
human
heart
for
that
is
what
i
feel
the
duke
give
me
your
hand
for
as
a
sapling
friend
which
is
transplanted
feels
all
the
forest
in
its
ignorant
veins
and
suffers
when
its
distant
mates
are
hurt
so
i
who
knew
you
not
here
all
alone
felt
the
distemper
stirring
in
my
blood
which
at
this
moment
blights
the
youth
of
france
the
young
man
rather
i
think
our
malady
is
yours
for
whence
upon
you
falls
this
giant
robe
child
whom
beforehand
they
have
robbed
of
glory
pale
prince
so
pale
against
your
sable
suit
why
are
you
pale
my
prince
the
duke
i
am
his
son
the
young
man
well
feeble
feverish
dreaming
of
the
past
like
you
rebellious
what
is
left
to
do
we
all
to
some
extent
your
father
sons
the
duke
you
are
his
soldiers
sons
that
just
as
glorious
and
is
no
less
redoubtable
a
burden
but
it
emboldens
me
for
i
can
say
they
but
the
sons
of
heroes
of
the
empire
they
be
content
to
take
the
emperor

doing
such
a
trade

my
death
the
duke
warlike
i
know
a
voice
the
scarf
the
countess
i
looking
for
it
the
duke
it
seems
this
little
hand
can
tame
the
countess
i
love
a
fiery
horse
the
duke
you
mistress
of
the
foils
the
countess
and
of
the
sword
the
duke
ready
for
anything
the
countess
toward
the
indeed
i
looking
for
it
everywhere
duke
ready
for
anything
for
your
imperial
highness
the
duke
you
cousin
the
countess
and
my
name
is
glorious

napoleone
scarampi
voice
well
ca
you
find
it
the
countess
no
a
voice
look
on
the
piano
the
countess
i
must
be
off
discuss
our
great
design
a
cry
as
if
she
had
found
what
she
was
looking
ah
here
it
is
the
voice
you
found
it
the
countess
on
the
harp
you
understand
it
gathered
up
in
folds
goes
maria
louisa
the
young
man
well
you
accept
the
duke
i
do
quite
understand
zealous
imperialism
from
a
liberal
the
young
man
true
a
republican
the
duke
you
come
to
me
rather
a
long
way
round
the
young
man
all
roads
lead
to
the
king
of
rome
my
scarlet
badge
i
thought
unfading
the
duke
faded
in
the
sun
the
young
man
of
austerlitz
yes
history
makes
us
drunk
the
battles
which
no
more
are
fought
are
told
the
blood
is
vanished
but
the
glory
gleams
so
that
there
is
no
he
but
he
never
won
such
victories
as
now
his
soldiers
perished
but
his
poets
live
the
duke
in
short
the
young
man
in
short
the
huckstering
times
the
god
they
exiled
you
your
touching
fate
our
weariness
and
everything
i
said
the
duke
you
said
as
artist
be
effective
to
be
bonapartist
the
young
man
so
you
accept
the
duke
no
the
young
man
what
the
duke
i
listened
well
and
you
were
charming
as
you
spoke
but
nothing
no
quiver
of
your
voice
told
me
of
france
you
voiced
a
craze
a
form
of
literature
the
young
man
i
carried
out
my
mission
clumsily
could
but
the
countess
yonder
speak
the
duke
no
use
i
love
the
bravery
glowing
in
her
eyes
but
that
not
france
that
is
my
family
when
next
you
seek
me
later
by
and
by
let
the
call
come
through
some
untutored
voice
wherein
rough
accents
of
the
people
throb
your
byronism
is
much
too
like
myself
you
could
not
have
persuaded
me
i
feel
myself
unready
for
the
crown
the
countess
out
maria
louisa
unready
you
turns
toward
the
do
trouble
i
just
going
and
for
the
ball
the
white
one
not
the
mauve
hastily
toward

unready
what
do
you
want
the
duke
a
year
of
dreams
of
study
the
countess
come
and
reign
the
duke
my
brain
not
ripe
the
countess
the
crown
enough
to
ripen
any
brain
the
duke
the
crown
of
light
shed
by
the
midnight
lamp
the
young
man
it
such
a
chance
the
duke
i
beg
your
pardon
chance
is
this
the
tailor
reappearing
the
countess
yet
the
duke
i
will
be
honest
in
default
of
genius
i
only
ask
three
hundred
wakeful
nights
the
young
man
but
this
refusal
will
confirm
the
rumors
the
countess
they
say
you

the
young
man
you
are
young
france

down
an
idea
obenaus
we
take
our
work
up
where
we

i
think
the

obenaus
in
eighteen
hundred
and
six
the
duke
did
no
event
make
that
year
memorable
obenaus

the
dust
off
the
why
eighteen
hundred
and
five
obenaus
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
meant
h
destiny
was
cruel
to
the
righteous
cause
we
cast
only
a
fleeting
glance
at
hapless
hours
when
the
philosopher
with
pensive
gaze
the
duke
and
so
in
eighteen
five
sir
nothing
happened

a
great
event

pressburg
treaty
obenaus

agreement

era

agitation
in
a
superb
and
with
her
cloak
obenaus
dietrichstein
out
maria

the
day
is
hushed
but
for
belated
birds
oh
with
what
tenderness
the
gloaming
fades
the
trees
maria
louisa
what
you
can
you
feel
nature

will
explain
the

the
perfume

into
the
chamber
on
its
breath
maria
louisa
explain
the
duke
with
every
gust
a
branch
is
wafted
in
a
fairer
miracle
than
that
which

forest
is
not
walking
only
not
like
a
mad
thing
walking
lo
on
wings
the
scented
evening
sets
the
forest
flying
maria
louisa
what
you
can
be
poetical
the
duke
at
times
music
is
listen
a
waltz
an
ordinary
waltz
yet
distance
gives
it
dignity
who
knows
journeying
through
the
woods
the
master
haunted
under
the
cyclamen
among
the
bracken
it
may
have
chanced
upon
beethoven
soul
maria
louisa
what
musical
as
well
the
duke
yes
when
i
choose
i
do
not
choose
i
hate
the
mystery
of
sounds
and
in
a
lovely
sunset
feel
with
dread
some
fair
thing
growing
soft
within
me
maria
louisa
that
fair
thing
in
your
heart
my
son

i
the
duke

said
it
maria

a
little
ere
you
do
me
harm
my
father
and
prince
metternich
are
so
good
when
the
decree
for
instance
made
you
count
i
said
not
count
duke

the
least
for
duke
is
something
and
you
duke
of
reichstadt
the
duke
lord
of
buchtiehrad
tirnowan
schwaden
maria
louisa
and
then
the
tact
your
father
name
was
never
mentioned
once
the
duke
why
not
have
called
me
son
of
unknown
father
maria
louisa
with
your
estates
and
revenues
you
can
be
the
pleasantest
and
richest
prince
of
austria
the
duke
the
richest
prince
maria
louisa
and
pleasantest
the
duke
of
austria
maria
louisa
enjoy
your
happiness
the
duke
i
drain
its
lees
maria
louisa
first
in
precedence
after
the
archdukes
some
day
you
marry
with
a
fair
princess
or
an
archduchess
or
perhaps
a
the
duke
ever
i
see
what
once
my
childish
eyes
caught
sight
of
his
little
throne
whose
back
was
like
a
drum
and
made
of
gold
more
splendid
since
saint
helena
upon
that
back
the
simple
little
n
the
letter
which
cries
no
to
time
maria
louisa
but
the
duke
yes
the
n
with
which
he
branded
kings
maria
louisa
the
kings
whose
blood
runs
through
your
mother
veins
and
yours
the
duke
i
do
not
need
their
blood
what
use
to
me
maria
louisa
a
glorious
heritage
the
duke
oh
paltry
maria
louisa
what
not
proud
to
bear
the
blood
of
charles
the
fifth
the
duke
no
for
it
courses
in
the
veins
of
others
but
when
i
tell
myself
i
bear
in
mine
a
corsican
lieutenant
blood
i
weep
to
see
the
thin
blue
trickle
at
my
wrist
maria
louisa
franz
the
duke
and
the
old
blood
can
but
harm
the
new
if
i
bear
blood
of
kings
let
me
be
bled
maria
louisa
silence
the
duke
what
am
i
saying
after
all
if
ever
i
had
yours
long
since
i
lost
it
his
blood
and
yours
have
fought
in
me
and
yours

to
flight

by
the
other

not
a
prisoner

that
is
the

a
moment

there
are
always
people
at
my
heels
a

not
i
you

i
not

if
i
risk
a
stroll
across
the
park
a
hidden
eye
blossoms
behind
each
leaf
of
course
not
prisoner
but
let
anyone
seek
private
speech
with
me
beneath
each
hedge
up
springs
the
mushroom
ear
i
truly
not
a
prisoner
but
when
i
ride
i
feel
the
delicate
attention
of
an
escort
i
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
a
prisoner
but
i
the
second
to
unseal
my
letters
not
at
all
prisoner
but
at
night
they
post
a
lackey

my
door

began
to
stir

clamorous
with
battles

wings
and
laurels
showered
upon

among

in
the
gilded
tassels
holding
them
and

sudden
lapsed
into

gravely
telling

smiled
benignantly
and

from
all
your
trappings
whose

the
loving
microscopic
brush
which

so
stoutly
the
duke
in
his
star
marmont
we
perfectly
agree
in
our
conclusions
the
duke
and
i
suppose
he
was
as
we
were
saying
marmont
he
was
a
general
of
some
importance
yet
it
were
hardly
fair
to
call
him
the
duke
wretch

a
seat
the
duke

marmont
i
will
let
you
conjugate

had
seen
him
i
should
have
returned

his
face
again
and
fell
under
the
spell
as
i
have
fallen
the
duke
why
sir
marmont
i
also
have
beheld
his
face
the
duke

that
frown
and
in
that
haughty
gesture

sparkling
eye
insult
me

not
understand
no
peace
in
europe
it
well
to
conquer
but
one
wants
to
live
berlin
vienna
never
never
paris
beginning
and
beginning
and
beginning
again
and
yet
again
as
in
a
nightmare
forever
and
forever
in
the
saddle
till
we
were
sick
of
it
the
lackey
taken
out
the
wooden
soldiers
and
come
what
about
us
the
duke
and
marmont
eh
the
lackey
us
the
men
the
mean
the
rank
and
file
us
tramping
broken
wounded
muddy
dying
having
no
hope
of
duchies
or
endowments
marching
along
and
never
getting
further
too
simple
and
too
ignorant
to
covet
the
famous
marshal
baton
in
our
knapsacks
what
about
us
who
marched
through
every
weather
sweating
but
fearless
shivering
without
trembling
kept
on
our
feel
by
by
fever
and
by
the
songs
we
sang
through
conquered
countries
us
upon
whom
for
seventeen
years
just
think
the
knapsack
sabre
flint
and
gun
beside
the
burden
of
an
empty
belly
made
the
sweet
weight
of
five
and
fifty
pounds
us
who
wore
bearskins
in
the
burning
tropics
and
marched
bareheaded
through
the
snows
of
russia
who
trotted
casually
from
spain
to
austria
us
who
to
free
our
legs
like
carrots
from
the
slough
of
miry
roads
often
with
both
hands
had
to
lug
them
out
us
who
not
having
jujubes
for
our
coughs
took
in
the
freezing
danube
who
just
had
leisure
when
some
officer
came
riding
up
and
gayly
cried
to
arms
the
enemy
is
on
us
drive
him
back
to
eat
a
slice
of
rook
and
raw
at
that
or
quickly
mix
a
delicate
with
melted
snow
and
a
dead
horse
blood
us
who
the
duke
at
last
the
lackey
at
night
had
little
fear
of
bullets
but
a
holy
dread
of
waking
cannibals
us
the
duke
at
last
the
lackey
who
marched
and
fought
fasting
and
only
stopped
the
duke
at
last
i
see
one
the
lackey
to
fight
and
then
stopped
fighting
four
to
one
only
to
march
and
stopped
again
to
fight
marching
and
fighting
naked
starved
but
merry
do
you
suppose
we
too
were
sick
of
it
marmont
but
the
lackey
though
we
owed
him
precious
little
thanks
nevertheless
was
we
whose
hearts
were
true
while
you
were
ambling
at
the
king
right
hand
in
short
your
highness
in
the
great
canteen
where
souls
are
fed
on
glory
he
may
find
marmont
his
laurels
are
not
worth
our
small
potatoes

marmont
surely
you
will
not
listen
to
him
thus
the
duke
no
sir
i
will
not
listen
thus
but
standing
marmont
my
lord
the
duke
for
in
the
volume
whose
sublime
chapters
are
headed
with
proud
capitals
you
are
the
titles
and
you
catch
the
eye
but
these
these
are
the
thousand
little
letters
you
nought
without
the
black
and
humble
army
that
goes
to
make
a
page
of
history
oh
my
brave
flambeau
painter
of
my
soldiers
to
think
while
you
were
near
me
all
this
month
i
only
looked
upon
you
as
a
spy
flambeau
oh
our
acquaintance
dates
much
further
back
the
duke
how
so
flambeau
ca
you
recall
me
the
duke
not
at
all
flambeau
one
thursday
in
the
garden
of
saint
cloud
marshal
duroc
stood
with
a
watching
your
highness
at
his
nurse
breast
its
whiteness
i
remember
startled
me
marshal
duroc
exclaimed
come
here
i
came
but
there
were
lots
of
things
to
make
me
nervous
the
imperial
child
the
gorgeous
rosy
sleeves
the
maid
of
honor
wore
duroc
the
breast
in
short
the
tuft
was
shivering
on
my
bearskin
so
much
so
that
your
highness
noticed
it
you
gazed
upon
it
pensively
what
was
it
and
while
you
hailed
it
with
a
milky
laugh
you
seemed
uncertain
which
to
admire
the
more
about
this
moving
scarlet
miracle
its
motion
or
the
fact
that
it
was
scarlet
suddenly
while
i
stooped
your
little
hands
began
lo
pull
the
precious
tuft
about
seeing
my
plight
the
marshal
cried
severely
do
interfere
i
did
interfere
but
having
sunk
upon
my
knees
i
heard
the
nurse
the
marshal
and
the
lady
laughing
and
when
i
rose
the
grass
was
strewn
with
red
as
for
my
tuft
that
was
a
beardless
wire
i
sign
an
order
said
duroc
for
two
back
to
my
quarters
then
i
strutted
radiant
you
there
hulloa
exclaimed
the
adjutant
who
plucked
you
and
i
cried
the
king
of
rome
and
that
is
how
one
thursday
morn
i
met
your
majesty
your
highness
has
developed
the
duke
no
not
developed
that
is
why
i
grieve
my
majesty
has
shrivelled
to
my
highness
marmont
flambeau
but
since
the
empire
fell
what
have
you
done
flambeau
i
think
i
acted
like
a
decent
beggar
i
know
fournier
and
solignac
in
may
didier
and
sarlovèze
conspire
and
fail
i
see
the
child
miard
perish
and
david
the
old
man
and
weep
they
have
beheaded
me
but
i
am
missing
good
i
come
back
to
paris
with
an
alias
i
smash
a
footstool
on
a
royal
guard
because
he
trodden
on
my
favorite
corn
i
take
the
chair
at
noisy
drinking
bouts
spend
thirty
pence
a
month
i
nurse
a
hope
that
in
the
var
that
other
still
may
land
i
swagger
in
a
bonapartist
hat
and
call
whoever
stares
at
me
a
vampire
i
fight
some
thirty
duels
i
conspire
at
béziers
fail
they
have
beheaded
me
but
i
am
missing
good
i
join
at
once
the
plot
at
lyons
all
are
seized
i
fly
they
have
beheaded
me
but
i
am
missing
so
i
come
back
to
paris
where
by
chance
i
find
myself
mixed
up
in
the
bazaar
plot
is
in
america
i
join
him
there
what
up
my
general
says
i
says
he
come
back
we
start
we
wrecked
my
general
drowned
but
i
know
how
to
swim
and
so
i
swim
bewailing
desnouettes
good
very
good
sun
azure
waves
and
a
ship
they
fish
me
up
i
land
in
time
to
be
among
the
plotters
of
saumur
we
fail
again
they
have
beheaded
me
but
i
am
missing
so
i
make
for
greece
to
rub
the
rust
off
thrashing
dirty
turks
one
morning
in
july
i
back
in
france
i
see
them
heaping
paving
stones
i
help
i
fight
at
night
the
tricolor
is
hoisted
instead
of
the
while
banner
of
the
king
but
as
i
think
there
still
is
something
lacking
to
crown
the
point
of
that
disloyal
staff
you
know
the
golden
thing
that
beats
its
wings
i
leave
to
plot
in
the
romagna
fail
a
relative
of
yours
the
duke
named
flambeau
camerata
makes
me
her
fencing
master
the
duke
ah
flambeau
in
tuscany
so
we
conspire
with
singlestick
and
rapier
next
there
a
post
of
danger
vacant
here
they
give
me
forged
credentials
here
i
am
i
here
but
every
day
i
see
the
countess
for
i
have
found
the
cave
your
highness
dug
with
your
preceptor
colin
in
the
garden
to
play
at
little
robinson
all
right
i
hide
in
it
i
find
it
has
two
openings
this
in
an
that
a
bed
of
nettles
i
wait
your
cousin
brings
her
and
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
roman
thingummies
she
on
her
i
amid
the
mud
she
looking
like
an
english
tourist
sketching
i
whispering
from
my
cavern
like
a
prompter
we
plan
the
means
to
make
you
emperor
the
duke
and
for
such
loyalty
so
long
maintained
what
do
you
ask
of
me
flambeau
just
pull
my
ear
the
duke
what
flambeau
as
your
father
used
to
when
we
pleased
him
the
duke
but
i
flambeau
i
waiting
come
the
thumb
and
index
the
duke
his
that
not
the
way
to
pull
an
ear
my
lord
you
do
know
how
you
much
too
gentlemanly
the
duke
ah
do
you
think
so
marmont
clumsy
thing
to
say
flambeau
well
in
a
french
prince
that
but
half
a
fault
the
duke
but
can
you
see
i
french
in
these
surroundings
flambeau
yes
you
do
match
it
rich
it
heavy
marmont
what
can
you
see
that
flambeau
my
brother
an
upholsterer
he
works
in
paris
for
fontaine
and
percier
they
try
to
imitate
us
here
but
lord
they
got
a
curious
kind
of
i
not
an
expert
but
i
got
an
eye
lifts
up
a
just
look
how
finnicking
this
is
puts
it
down
and
looks
at
but
then
the
tapestry
what
taste
what
mystery
it
sings
it
laughs
it
crushes
all
the
room
why
do
you
know
why
these
are
gobelins
how
plain
it
is
that
cunning
craftsmen
made
them
this
taste
this
elegance
swears
with
the
rest
and
you
my
lord
were
also
made
in
france
malmont
he
must
go
back
flambeau
and
on
the
cross
of
honor
once
more
engrave
a
little
emperor
the
duke
whom
have
they
put
there
now
flambeau
henry
the
fourth
well
damn
it
all
it
had
to
be
a
fighter
but
how
napoleon
must
laugh
to
wear
king
henry
mask
upon
his
face
have
you
ever
seen
the
cross
the
duke
in
shops
flambeau
my
lord
it
must
be
seen
upon
a
breast
here
on
the
cloth
a
gout
of
ardent
blood
which
fell
and
falling
turned
to
burnished
gold
and
to
enamel
with
an
edge
of
green
like
a
jewel
pouring
from
a
wound
the
duke
it
must
have
looked
magnificent
my
friend
here
on
your
bosom
flambeau
i
i
never
had
it
the
duke
what
after
all
your
modest
heroism
flambeau
one
had
to
do
far
greater
deeds
to
win
it
the
duke
you
made
no
claim
flambeau
the
little
corporal
did
bestow
it
so
i
had
earned
it
the
duke
then
i
who
have
no
power
no
throne
no
title
i
who
am
but
a
memory
in
a
phantom
that
duke
of
reichstadt
who
with
helpless
grief
can
only
wander
under
austrian
trees
carving
an
n
upon
their
mossy
trunks
wayfarer
only
noticed
when
i
cough
who
have
no
longer
even
the
little
piece
of
watered
silk
so
scarlet
in
my
cradle
i
on
whose
woes
they
vainly
lavish
stars
who
only
wear
two
crosses
not
the
one
i
exiled
prisoner
sick
who
may
not
ride
along
the
front
of
pompous
regiments
scattering
stars
among
my
heroes
yet
i
hope
i
think
the
son
of
such
a
father
into
whose
hands
a
firmament
was
given
i
think
in
spite
of
shadows
and
dead
days
a
little
of
the
star
clings
to
my
fingers
john
seraph
peter
flambeau
i
adorn
you
flambeau
you
the
duke
oh
this
ribbon
is
not
real
flambeau
the
real
is
that
we
weep
in
taking
i
have
wept
marmont
besides
it
must
be
legalized
in
paris
the
duke
but
how
to
get
to
paris
flambeau
pack
your
trunk
the
duke
alas
flambeau
no
more
alas
the
ninth
and
if
you
like
to
be
on
the
the
thirtieth
you
be
there
if
you
like
come
to
the
ball
given
by
nepomuk
the
duke
and
marmont
by
whom
flambeau
prince
metternich
clement
lothair
wenceslas
nepomuk
come
no
more
alas
marmont
you
utter
dangerous
secrets
in
my
presence
flambeau
you
not
betray
a
plot
in
which
you
share
the
duke
not
marmont
marmont
yes
i
with
you
flambeau
all
the
same
you
did
use
much
flattery
to
win
me
you
gave
me
quite
a
warm
reception
flambeau
yes
and
won
a
warm
reception
for
myself
marmont
very
imprudent
flambeau
true
but
then
my
failing
is
ever
overdoing
things
a
little
i
always
add
a
trifle
to
my
orders
and
wear
a
when
i
go
to
battle
my
little
joke
marmont
so
if
the
camerata
cares
to
employ
me
the
duke
no
not
marmont
flambeau
pooh
let
him
redeem
himself
the
duke
no
marmont
i
have
lists
carefully
made
of
all
the
malcontents
maison
the
french
ambassador
is
my
friend
flambeau
oh
he
can
serve
us
the
duke
compromises
no
i
not
let
marmont
consecrate
himself
marmont
when
you
are
crowned
my
lord

will
obey
you
meanwhile
i
go
at
once
to
general
maison
marmont
flambeau
that
venerable
rascal
in
the
right

duke

proof

france
still
feels
herself
my
father
widow

ancient
love
these
worthy
people
bore
us

have
died

days

you
recall
your
father
the
duke
i
remember
a
man
who
pressed
me
hard
against
a
star
and
as
he
pressed
i
felt
with
tears
of
fright
the
diamond
star
was
stamped
upon
my
heart
sire
it
has
stayed
there
the
emperor
do
i
blame
you
for
it
the
duke
yes
let
the
goodness
of
your
nature
speak
when
i
was
small
you
loved
me
did
you
not
you
loved
to
have
me
with
you
at
your
meals
and
so
we
used
to
dine
together
the
emperor
charming
the
duke
my
hair
was
long
and
i
was
prince
of
parma
and
when
they
punished
me
you
let
me
off
the
emperor
do
you
remember
how
you
hated
ponies
the
duke
one
day
they
showed
me
one
as
white
as
snow
i
stamped
with
fury
in
the
the
emperor
you
thought
a
pony
was
a
deadly
insult
the
duke
i
cried
with
rage
i
want
a
great
big
horse
the
emperor
and
now
you
want
another
great
big
horse
the
duke
and
how
i
used
to
beat
my
german
nurses
the
emperor
and
how
with
colin
you
would
calmly
dig
enormous
holes
about
my
park
the
duke
for
crusoe
the
emperor
he
was
man
friday
the
duke
and
i
used
to
hide
i
had
a
gun
three
hatchets
and
a
bow
the
emperor
then
you
stood
sentinel
before
my
door
the
duke
as
a
hussar
the
emperor
and
ladies
coming
late
found
this
excuse
quite
natural
oh
sire
we
only
stopped
to
kiss
the
sentinel
the
duke
you
loved
me
then
the
emperor
i
love
you
now
the
duke
then
prove
it
the
emperor
my
franz
my
grandson

the
duke
do
tell
lies

duke
i
love
you
the
emperor
yes

appeared
alone
without
a
drum
upon
the
bridge
at
strassburg
the
king
would
vanish
the
duke
i
adore
you
grandad
the
emperor
i
stifled
the

should
have
held
my

ordered
paris
the
emperor
really
the
duke
for
my
cough
if
i
to
spend
a
season
there
of
course
i
ca
stop
anywhere
but
at
the
louvre
the
emperor
indeed
the
duke
and
if
you
liked
the
emperor
they
often
begged
us
to
wink
at
your
escaping
the
duke
wink
at
once
the
emperor
oh
for
all
me
the
duke
there
no
one
else
the
emperor
i
think
the
duke
do
think
do
think
those
horrid
second
thoughts
consult
your
feelings
only
and
your
heart
be
so
pretty
if
an
emperor
once
upset
all
history
to
spoil
his
grandson
and
then
it
something
something
rather
fine
if
you
can
just
remark
quite
innocently
know
my
grandson
emperor
of
the
french
the
emperor
certainly
the
duke
and
you
say
it
say
you
say
it
the

will
you
send
me
as
ambassador
metternich
delightful
the
duke
and
you
visit
me
in
state
the
emperor
yes
very
likely
when
the
chambers
rise
metternich
we
only
ask
some
trifling
guarantees
the
duke
ask
what
you
like
the
emperor
well
are
you
happy
metternich
first
we
come
to
terms
on
trivial
points
of
detail
certain
seditious
groups
should
be
dissolved
our
neighbors
must
not
harbor
thunderbolts
the
duke
dear
grandfather
metternich
ah
then
we
very
weary
of
hearing
of
the
heroes
of
july
the
duke
but
metternich
now
the
imperialists
and
radicals
are
linked
we
cut
the
link
we
can
not
favor
the
dangerous
modern
spirit
we
expel
lammenais
the
duke
but
metternich
and
chateaubriand
ah
we
also
put
a
muzzle
on
the
press
the
duke
oh

no
hurry

emperor
pardon
me
there
is
the
duke
pardon
me

attacking
freedom

have
free
hand
in
italy
ah
not
so
much
excitement
about
poland
the
duke
ah
and
what
else
metternich
well
we
shall
have
to
solve
the
question
of
the
names
you
know
the
names
of
battles
sire
which
you
well
did
not
win
the
marshals
must
not
wear
them
the
duke
what
is
that
the
emperor
perhaps
metternich
forgive
me
but
they
must
not
think
they
lords
of
austrian
places
and
you
can
not
approve
their
way
of
carrying
off
to
france
our
villages

means
of
upstart
titles

universal
hopes

efface
that
gleam

his
inches
for
was
a
hatter
set
the
legend
going
the
real
napoleon
after
all
was
poupart
ah
never
think
my
hatred
of
thee
slumbers
was
for
thy
shape
sake
first
i
hated
thee
thou
of
bloody
hat
that
seemed
fashioned
out
of
raven
wings
i
hated
thee
for
pitilessly
soaring
above
the
fields
which
witnessed
our
defeats
seeming
on
the
ruddy
sky
the
orb
of
some
sable
sun
and
for
thy
crown
wherein
the
devil
lurks
thou
juggler
hat
laid
with
a
sudden
hand
upon
a
throne
an
army
or
a
nation
when
thou
wert
lifted
all
had
disappeared
i
hated
thee
for
the
salutes
i
gave
thee
for
thy
simplicity
mere
affectation
thy
insolent
joy
thou
piece
of
common
beaver
amid
the
glittering
diadems
of
gold
for
staying
firmly
on
his
haughty
head
when
i
sought
flattering
epithets
to
please
thee
conqueror
new
acclaimed
i
hated
thee
i
hate
thee
now
old
conquered
and
betrayed
i
hate
thee
for
thy
haughty
shadow
cast
forever
on
the
wall
of
history
i
hate
thee
for
thy
jacobin
cockade
staring
upon
me
like
a
bloodshot
eye
for
all
the
murmurs
sounding
in
thy
shell
that
huge
black
shell
the
waves
have
left
behind
wherein
the
shuddering
listener
may
hear
the
rumor
of
a
nation
on
the
march
i
hate
thee
for
the
pride
of
france
whose
bounds
thou
hast
enlarged
until
she
scorns
the
world
for
béranger
i
hate
thee
and
raffet
for
all
the
songs
and
all
the
pasquinades
and
for
the
halo
of
saint
helena
i
hate
thee
hate
thee
i
shall
not
be
happy
until
thy
clumsy
triangle
of
cloth
despoiled
of
its
traditions
is
again
what
it
should
have
ceased
to
be
in
france
the
headgear
of
a
village
constable
i
hate
but
suddenly
how
strange
the
present
sometimes
with
impish
glee
will
ape
the
past
seeing
thy
shape
before
me
thus
carries
my
mind
back
to
a
distant
day
for
it
was
here
he
always
put
thee
down
when
twenty
years
ago
he
sojourned
here
this
room
was
then
the
here
waiting
till
graciously
he
showed
himself
dukes
princes
magyars
huddling
in
a
corner
fixed
from
afar
their
humbled
eyes
upon
thee
like
lions
dreading
with
a
helpless
fury
the
tamer
hat
forgotten
in
the
cage
was
thus
he
placed
thee
and
here
lay
as
now
weapons
and
papers
one
might
say
was
he
had
tossed
thee
carelessly
upon
the
map
that
this
were
still
his
home
this
bonaparte
and
that
by
turning
on
the
threshold
there
i
should
behold
the
grenadier

starts

flambeau

the
metternich

hush
flambeau
voice
my
little
joke
shot
is

duke
missed
metternich
with
what
ease
he
finds
his
way
about
the
duke
he
knows
it
he
has
been
here
once
before
metternich
lackeys
show
themselves
at
the
too
late
begone
i
do
not
need
your
help
lackeys
the
duke
and
not
a
word
of
this
to
the
police
metternich
i
never
raise
a
laugh
against
myself
what
the
importance
of
a
veteran
joke
you
not
napoleon
the
duke
who
has
settled
that
metternich
you
have
his
hat
perhaps
but
not
his
head
the
duke
ah
yes
an
epigram
to
damp
my
ardor
is
not
the
this
time
is
the
lash
that
drives
me
headlong
toward
the
wildest
dreams
i
not
the
head
you
say
how
do
you
know
metternich
the
candelabrum
in
his
hand
and
leads
duke
the
cheval
how
do
i
know
just
glance
into
this
mirror
look
at
the
sullen
sadness
of
your
face
the
grim
betrayal
of
your
fair
complexion
this
crushing
golden
hair
i
bid
you
look
the
duke
to
get
out
of
his
no
metternich
you
environed
with
a
fatal
mist
the
duke
no
metternich
though
you
know
it
not
is
germany
spain
for
ages
dormant
in
your
blood
make
you
so
haughty
sorrowful
and
charming
the
duke
no
no
metternich
bethink
you
of
your
you
reign
come
come
you
would
be
pale
and
wan
one
of
those
timid
introspective
kings
who
are
imprisoned
lest
they
abdicate
the
duke
no
no
metternich
not
yours
the
energetic
brow
yours
is
the
brow
of
languor
and
of
yearning
the
duke
passes
his
left
hand
across
his
my
brow
metternich
and
drearily
your
highness
passes
over
an
austrian
brow
a
spanish
hand
the
duke
my
hand
metternich
observe
the
frail
and
tapering
fingers
seen
fair
and
jewelled
in
long
lines
of
portraits
the
duke
no
metternich
and
those
eyes
through
which
your
ancestors
look
forth
the
duke
the
eyes
metternich
ay
note
them
well
the
eyes
wherein
how
many
eyes
we
seen
before
dream
of
the
fagot
weep
for
perished
squadrons
dare
you
whose
conscience
is
so
sensitive
ascend
the
throne
of
france
with
eyes
like
those
the

ah
but
my
father

naught
of
him
is
in

search
search
again
come
closer
to
the

he
stole
our
ancient
blood
to
mix
with
his
that
his
might
grow
more
ancient
but
he
stole
only
the
racial
melancholy
and
the
feebleness
and
the
duke
i
beseech
you
metternich
look
look
in
the
mirror
you
turn
pale
the
duke
enough
metternich
and
on
your
lips
you
recognize
the
pout
as
of
a
doll
of
marie
antoinette
her
whom
your
france
beheaded
for
your
father

stealing
glory
stole

depressed
and
yet
the
plot
must
come
to
a
head
if
i
may
trust
the
symptoms
these
lines
were
slipped
into
my
hand
this
morning
takes
a
note
out
of

to
be
there
early
and
to
wear
his
uniform
beneath
a
violet
cloak

duke
oh
too
criminal
prokesch
the
note
the
duke
the
note
is
from
a
woman
anxious
not
to
miss
me
i
taken
her
advice
for
i
am
here
only
for
love
adventure
prokesch
no
the
duke
that
all
prokesch
but
then
the
plot
the
duke
oh
too
criminal
dear
country
made
of
sunshine
and
of
laughter
to
raise
upon
the
high
seat
of
thy
glory
a
child
of
night
misfortune
and
the
escurial
what
if
when
i
were
seated
there
the
past
plunging
its
yellow
hands
into
my
soul
with
hideous
claws
unearthed
some
ancestor
some
rudolph
or
some
philip
ah
i
dread
lest
at
the
humming
of
imperial
bees
the
monster
sleeping
in
me
should
awake
prokesch
prince
this
is
madness
the
duke
a
shudder
and
a
look
which
prokesch
back
with
madness
do
you
think
so
prokesch
good
heavens
the
duke
buried
in
their
fastnesses
cowering
in
bohemia
or
castile
each
had
his
madness
what
is
mine
to
be
come
we
decide
you
see
i
am
resigned
is
time
to
choose
and
i
have
choice
enough
my
thoughtful
forebears
left
a
catalogue
shall
i
be
melomaniac
or
astrologer
catch
birds
bend
alembics
mumble
prayers
prokesch
too
well
i
see
what
metternich
has
done
the
duke
grandfather
shall
i
carry
on
your
great
herbarium
where
the
hellebore
is
missing
or
shall
i
living
play
at
being
dead
which
ancestor
will
godfather
my
madness
the
the
alchemist
or
bigot
you
see
they
took
their
madness
rather
sadly
but
mingled
perfumes
make
a
novel
scent
my
brain
mixed
of
these
gloomy
brains
may
start
some
pretty
little
madness
of
its
own
come
what
shall
my
peculiar
madness
be
by
heavens
my
instincts
conquered
till
make
it
quite
simple
i
be
mad
with
love
i
love
and
love
and
crush
with
bitter
hate
this
austrian
lip
under
a
passionate
kiss
prokesch
prince
the
duke
as
don
juan
i
am
all
my
race
snarer
of
hearts
astrologer
of
eyes
i
have
herbaria
full
of
blighted
names
and
the
philosopher
stone
i
seek
is
love
prokesch
my
lord
the
duke
why
if
you
think
of
it
dear
friend
napoleon
son
don
juan
is
strict
logic
the
soul
the
same
ever
dissatisfied
the
same
unceasing
lust
of
victory
oh
splendid
blood
another
has
corrupted
who
striving
to
be
cæsar
was
not
able
thy
energy
is
not
all
dead
within
me
a
misbegotten
cæsar
is
don
juan
yes
is
another
way
of
conquering
thus
i
shall
know
that
fever
of
the
heart
which
byron
tells
us
kills
whom
it
devours
and
is
a
way
of
being
still
my
father
napoleon
or
don
juan
they
decision
the
magic
will
and
the
seductive
grace
when
to
retake
a
great
unfaithful
land
calm
and
alone
sure
of
himself
and
her
the
adventurer
landed
in
the
gulf
of
juan
he
felt
don
juan
thrill
and
when
don
juan
pricked
a
new
conquest
in
his
list
of
loves
did
he
not
feel
the
pride
of
bonaparte
and
after
all
who
knows
whether
is
greater
to
conquer
worlds
or
be
a
moment
loved
so
be
it
is
well
the
legend
closes
thus
and
that
conqueror
is
the
other
son
i
the
fair
shadow
of
the
dusky
hero
and
as
he
conquered
nations
one
by
one
so
will
i
conquer
women
one
by
one
moonbeams
shall
be
my
sun
of
austerlitz
prokesch

for
your
irony

furious
i
was
in
bed
my
naked
foot
peeped
out
and
lying
on
the
polished
wood
as
if
thomire
had
carved
it
seemed
at
once
to
turn
the
medicean
bed
into
an
empire
bed
and
seeing
the
envoy
furtively
look
down
i
smiled
and
said
you
looking
at
my
foot
and
so
he
was
in
spite
of
all
misfortunes

the
man
was
looking
at
my
foot
was
this
coquettish
well

of
it

was
the
crime

remained
a

for

foot
had
importance

it
is
everybody

some
grimy
officer
rode

roared
we
conquered
the

so
he
roared
to

he
did
to

i
hear
the

bah
my

should
wonder
for
on
this
spot
eleven
the

eleven
flambeau
i
see
them
now
eleven
as
like
as
peas
between
the
flapping
of
their
foolish
ears
who
marched
they
knew
not
whence
nor
why
nor
whither
but
gayly
marched
and
rolled
their
rataplan
we
used
to
chaff
them
for
their
funny
ways
made
them
the
darlings
of
the
sutler
wife
but
when
they
beat
the
charge
like
little
rabbits
eleven
drums
with
sticks
they
set
our
bayonets
thrilling
with
their
thunder
the
quivering
zigzags
seemed
to
cry
aloud
our
lightning
not
in
vain
well
on
this
spot
a
brazen
devil
hiccoughed
fire
and
steel
and
took
them
in
the
flank
yes
all
the
eleven
but
by
the
lord
you
should
have
seen
the
woman
she
gathered
up
her
apron
like
a
gleaner
and
madly
gleaned
the
little
ebony
drumsticks
clears
his
only
to
speak
of
it
gives
me
a
cold
picks
a
red
here
how
to

i
complete
the
price

fated
i
should
seek
his
and
here
above
the
multitudinous
dead
be
the
white
victim
growing
daily
whiter
renouncing
praying
asking
but
to
suffer
yearning
toward
heaven
like
sacrificial
incense
and
while
betwixt
the
heavens
and
this
field
i
am
outstretched
with
all
my
soul
and

i
feel
the
shuddering
furrows
rise
i
feel
the
hill
upheaved
beneath
my
feet
to
lift
me
gently
to
the
stooping
heavens
is
meet
and
right
the
should
offer
this
sacrifice
that
henceforth
it
may
bear
pure
and
unstained
its
name
of
victory

behold
me
ransom
of

rustled
through
my
hair
the
shudder
of

a
sacramental
host
what
more
reproaches
can
they
hurl
o

against
our
hapless
fate
oh

but
if
the
eaglet
is
resigned
to
perish
like
the
innocent
yielding
swan
nailed
in
the
gloom
above
some
lofty
gate
he
must
become
the
high
and
holy
signal
that
scares
the

and
calls
back

archduke
or
an

the
