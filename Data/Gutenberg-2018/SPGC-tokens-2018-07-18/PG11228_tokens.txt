charles

the
editor
of
the
i
at
break
of
day
stay
here
beside
her
major
i
shall
not
he
needed
for
an
hour
yet
meanwhile
i
go
downstairs
and
snatch
a
bit
of
sleep
or
talk
to
old
jane
the
night
was
hot
and
sultry
though
the
windows
of
the
chamber
were
wide
open
and
the
muslin
curtains
looped
back
not
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
only
the
shrill
chirp
of
the
cicada
and
the
muffled
croaking
of
the
frogs
in
some
distant
marsh
broke
the
night
silence
the
heavy
scent
of
magnolias
overpowering
even
the
strong
smell
of
drugs
in
the
sickroom
suggested
death
and
funeral
wreaths
sorrow
and
tears
the
long
home
the
last
sleep
the
major
shivered
with
apprehension
as
the
slender
hand
which
he
held
in
his
own
contracted
nervously
and
in
a
spasm
of
pain
clutched
his
fingers
with
a
viselike
grip
major
carteret
though
dressed
in
brown
linen
had
thrown
off
his
coat
for
greater
comfort
the
stifling
heat
in
spite
of
the
fan
which
he
plied
mechanically
was
scarcely
less
oppressive
than
his
own
thoughts
long
ago
while
yet
a
mere
boy
in
years
he
had
come
back
from
appomattox
to
find
his
family
one
of
the
oldest
and
proudest
in
the
state
hopelessly
impoverished
by
the
war
even
their
ancestral
home
swallowed
up
in
the
common
ruin
his
elder
brother
had
sacrificed
his
life
on
the
bloody
altar
of
the
lost
cause
and
his
father
broken
and
chagrined
died
not
many
years
later
leaving
the
major
the
last
of
his
line
he
had
tried
in
various
pursuits
to
gain
a
foothold
in
the
new
life
but
with
indifferent
success
until
he
won
the
hand
of
olivia
merkell
whom
he
had
seen
grow
from
a
small
girl
to
glorious
womanhood
with
her
money
he
had
founded
the
morning
chronicle
which
he
had
made
the
leading
organ
of
his
party
and
the
most
influential
paper
in
the
state
the
fine
old
house
in
which
they
lived
was
hers
in
this
very
room
she
had
first
drawn
the
breath
of
life
it
had
been
their
nuptial
chamber
and
here
too
within
a
few
hours
she
might
die
for
it
seemed
impossible
that
one
could
long
endure
such
frightful
agony
and
live
one
cloud
alone
had
marred
the
otherwise
perfect
serenity
of
their
happiness
olivia
was
childless
to
have
children
to
perpetuate
the
name
of
which
he
was
so
proud
to
write
it
still
higher
on
the
roll
of
honor
had
been
his
dearest
hope
his
disappointment
had
been
proportionately
keen
a
few
months
ago
this
dead
hope
had
revived
and
altered
the
whole
aspect
of
their
lives
but
as
time
went
on
his
age
had
begun
to
tell
upon
her
until
even
price
the
most
cheerful
and
optimistic
of
physicians
had
warned
him
while
hoping
for
the
best
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst
to
add
to
the
danger
carteret
had
only
this
day
suffered
from
a
nervous
shock
which
it
was
feared
had
hastened
by
several
weeks
the
expected
event
price
went
downstairs
to
the
library
where
a
dim
light
was
burning
an
old
black
woman
dressed
in
a
gingham
frock
with
a
red
bandana
handkerchief
coiled
around
her
head
by
way
of
turban
was
seated
by
an
open
window
she
rose
and
curtsied
as
the
doctor
entered
and
dropped
into
a
willow
near
her
own
how
did
this
happen
jane
he
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
adding
with
assumed
severity
you
ought
to
have
taken
better
care
of
your
mistress

woman

such

the
doctor
knew
very
well
had
been
all
too
common
in
the
old
slavery
days
and
not
a
few
of
them
had
been
projected
into
the
new
era
sins
like
snakes
die
hard
the
habits
and
customs
of
a
people
were
not
to
be
changed
in
a
day
nor
by
the
stroke
of
a
pen
as
family
physician
and
father
confessor
by
brevet
price
had
looked
upon
more
than
one
hidden
skeleton
and
no
one
in

had
had
better
opportunities
than
old

learning
the

anxiously
you

jane
said
the
doctor
for
two
long
hours
they
fought
back
the
grim
spectre
that
stood
by
the
bedside
the
child
was
born
at
dawn
both
mother
and
child
the
doctor
said
would
live
bless
its
exclaimed
mammy
jane
as
she
held
up
the
tiny
mite
which
bore
as
much
resemblance
to
mature
humanity
as
might
be
expected
of
an
infant
which
had
for
only
a
few
minutes
drawn
the
breath
of
life
bless
its
it
de
spit
an
image
er
its
pappy
the
doctor
smiled
the
major
laughed
aloud
jane
unconscious
witticism
or
conscious
flattery
whichever
it
might
be
was
a
welcome
diversion
from
the
tense
strain
of
the
last
few
hours
be
that
as
it
may
said
price
cheerfully
and
i
not
dispute
it
the
child
is
a
very
fine
boy
a
very
fine
boy
indeed
take
care
of
it
major
he
added
with
a
touch
of
solemnity
for
your
wife
can
never
bear
another
with
the
child
first
cry
a
refreshing
breeze
from
the
distant
ocean
cooled
the
hot
air
of
the
chamber
the
heavy
odor
of
the
magnolias
with
its
mortuary
suggestiveness
gave
place
to
the
scent
of
rose
and
lilac
and
honeysuckle
the
birds
in
the
garden
were
singing
lustily
all
these
sweet
and
pleasant
things
found
an
echo
in
the
major
heart
he
stood
by
the
window
and
looking
toward
the
rising
sun
breathed
a
silent
prayer
of
thanksgiving
all
nature
seemed
to
rejoice
in
sympathy
with
his
happiness
at
the
fruition
of
this
hope
and
to
predict
for
this
wonderful
child
a
bright
and
glorious
future
old
mammy
jane
however
was
not
entirely
at
ease
concerning
the
child
she
had
discovered
under
its
left
ear
a
small
mole
which
led
her
to
fear
that
the
child
was
born
for
bad
luck
had
the
baby
been
black
or
yellow
or
jane
would
unhesitatingly
have
named
as
his
ultimate
fate
a
not
uncommon
form
of
taking
off
usually
resultant
upon
the
infraction
of
certain
laws
or
in
these
swift
modern
days
upon
too
violent
a
departure
from
established
social
customs
it
was
manifestly
impossible
that
a
child
of
such
high
quality
as
the
grandson
of
her
old
mistress
should
die
by
judicial
strangulation
but
nevertheless
the
warning
was
a
serious
thing
and
not
to
be
lightly
disregarded
not
wishing
to
be
considered
as
a
prophet
of
evil
omen
jane
kept
her
own
counsel
in
regard
to
this
significant
discovery
but
later
after
the
child
was
several
days
old
she
filled
a
small
vial
with
water
in
which
the
infant
had
been
washed
and
took
it
to
a
certain
wise
old
black
woman
who
lived
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
town
and
was
well
known
to
be
versed
in
witchcraft
and
conjuration
the
conjure
woman
added
to
the
contents
of
the
bottle
a
bit
of
calamus
root
and
one
of
the
cervical
vertebrae
from
the
skeleton
of
a
black
cat
with
several
other
mysterious
ingredients
the
nature
of
which
she
did
not
disclose
following
instructions
given
her
aunt
jane
buried
the
bottle
in
carteret
back
yard
one
night
during
the
full
moon
as
a
charm
to
ward
off
evil
from
the
little
grandson
of
her
dear
mistress
so
long
since
dead
and
gone
to
heaven
ii
the
christening
party
they
named
the
carteret
baby
theodore
felix
theodore
was
a
family
name
and
had
been
borne
by
the
eldest
son
for
several
generations
the
major
himself
being
a
second
son
having
thus
given
the
child
two
beautiful
names
replete
with
religious
and
sentimental
significance
they
called
him
dodie
the
baby
was
christened
some
six
weeks
after
its
birth
by
which
time
carteret
was
able
to
be
out
old
mammy
jane
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
church
but
who
like
some
better
informed
people
in
all
ages
found
religion
not
inconsistent
with
a
strong
vein
of
superstition
felt
her
fears
for
the
baby
future
much
relieved
when
the
rector
had
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
sprinkled
little
dodie
with
the
water
from
the
carved
marble
font
which
had
come
from
england
in
the
reign
of
king
charles
the
martyr
as
the
son
of
james
was
known
to
andrew
upon
this
special
occasion
mammy
jane
had
been
provided
with
a
seat
downstairs
among
the
white
people
to
her
own
intense
satisfaction
and
to
the
secret
envy
of
a
small
colored
attendance
in
the
gallery
to
whom
she
was
ostentatiously
pointed
out
by
her
grandson
jerry
porter
at
the
morning
chronicle
office
who
sat
among
them
in
the
front
row
on
the
following
monday
evening
the
major
gave
a
christening
party
in
honor
of
this
important
event
owing
to
carteret
still
delicate
health
only
a
small
number
of
intimate
friends
and
family
connections
were
invited
to
attend
these
were
the
rector
of
andrew
old
polly
ochiltree
the
godmother
old
delamere
a
distant
relative
and
also
one
of
the
sponsors
and
his
grandson
tom
delamere
the
major
had
also
invited
lee
ellis
his
young
city
editor
for
whom
he
had
a
great
liking
apart
from
his
business
value
and
who
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
house
these
with
the
family
itself
which
consisted
of
the
major
his
wife
and
his
clara
pemberton
a
young
woman
of
about
eighteen
made
up
the
eight
persons
for
whom
covers
were
laid
ellis
was
the
first
to
arrive
a
tall
young
man
with
a
slightly
freckled
face
hair
verging
on
auburn
a
firm
chin
and
honest
gray
eyes
he
had
come
half
an
hour
early
and
was
left
alone
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
parlor
a
spacious
room
with
large
windows
and
fitted
up
in
excellent
taste
with
stately
reminiscences
of
a
past
generation
the
walls
were
hung
with
figured
paper
the
ceiling
was
whitewashed
and
decorated
in
the
middle
with
a
plaster
from
which
hung
a
massive
chandelier
sparkling
with
prismatic
rays
from
a
hundred
crystal
pendants
there
was
a
handsome
mantel
set
with
tiles
on
which
fauns
and
satyrs
nymphs
and
dryads
disported
themselves
in
idyllic
abandon
the
furniture
was
old
and
in
keeping
with
the
room
at
seven
a
carriage
drove
up
from
which
alighted
an
elderly
gentleman
with
white
hair
and
mustache
and
bowed
somewhat
with
years
short
of
breath
and
painfully
weak
in
the
legs
he
was
assisted
from
the
carriage
by
a
colored
man
apparently
about
forty
years
old
to
whom
short
and
spectacles
imparted
an
air
of
sobriety
this
attendant
gave
his
arm
respectfully
to
the
old
gentleman
who
leaned
upon
it
heavily
but
with
as
little
appearance
of
dependence
as
possible
the
servant
assuming
a
similar
unconsciousness
of
the
weight
resting
upon
his
arm
assisted
the
old
gentleman
carefully
up
the
steps
i
all
right
now
sandy
whispered
the
gentleman
as
soon
as
his
feet
were
planted
firmly
on
the
piazza
you
may
come
back
for
me
at
nine
having
taken
his
hand
from
his
servant
arm
he
advanced
to
meet
a
lady
who
stood
in
the
door
awaiting
him
a
tall
elderly
woman
gaunt
and
angular
of
frame
with
a
mottled
face
and
high
cheekbones
partially
covered
by
bands
of
hair
entirely
too
black
and
abundant
for
a
person
of
her
age
if
one
might
judge
from
the
lines
of
her
mouth
which
are
rarely
deceptive
in
such
matters
perhaps
you
better
not
send
your
man
away
delamere
observed
the
lady
in
a
high
shrill
voice
which
grated
upon
the
old
ears
he
was
slightly
hard
of
hearing
but
like
most
deaf
people
resented
being
screamed
at
you
might
need
him
before
nine
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
after
one
has
had
the
second
stroke
and
moreover
our
butler
has
fallen
down
the
back
steps
negroes
are
so
careless
and
sprained
his
ankle
so
that
he
ca
stand
i

to

your
solicitude
replied
delamere
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
in
his
voice
but
my
health
is
very
good
just
at
present
and
i
do
not
anticipate
any
catastrophe
which
will
require
my
servant
presence
before
i
am
ready
to
go
home
but
i
have
no
doubt
madam
he
continued
with
a
courteous
inclination
that
sandy
will
be
pleased
to
serve
you
if
you
desire
it
to
the
best
of
his

sandy
retired
with
a
bow
while
descending
the
steps
to
the
carriage
which
had
waited
for
him
he
came
face
to
face
with
a
young
man
just
entering
the
house
am
i
in
time
for
dinner
sandy
asked
the
newcomer

mistuh

er
time

back
which
won
be
fer
fifteen
minutes
er
so
yit
throwing
away
the
cigarette
which
he
held
between
his
fingers
the
young
man
crossed
the
piazza
with
a
light
step
and
after
a
preliminary
knock
for
an
answer
to
which
he
did
not
wait
entered
the
house
with
the
air
of
one
thoroughly
at
home
the
lights
in
the
parlor
had
been
lit
and
ellis
who
sat
talking
to
major
carteret
when
the
newcomer
entered
covered
him
with
a
jealous
glance
slender
and
of
medium
height
with
a
small
head
of
almost
perfect
contour
a
symmetrical
face
dark
almost
to
swarthiness
black
eyes
which
moved
somewhat
restlessly
curly
hair
of
raven
tint
a
slight
mustache
small
hands
and
feet
and
fashionable
attire
tom
delamere
the
grandson
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
already
arrived
was
easily
the
handsomest
young
man
in
wellington
but
no
discriminating
observer
would
have
characterized
his
beauty
as
manly
it
conveyed
no
impression
of
strength
but
did
possess
a
certain
element
feline
rather
than
feminine
which
subtly
negatived
the
idea
of
manliness
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
major
nodded
curtly
to
ellis
saluted
his
grandfather
respectfully
and
inquired
for
the
ladies
olivia
is
dressing
for
dinner
replied
the
major
ochiltree
is
in
the
kitchen
struggling
with
the
servants
clara
ah
here
she
comes
now
ellis
whose
senses
were
preternaturally
acute
where
clara
was
concerned
was
already
looking
toward
the
hall
and
was
the
first
to
see
her
clad
in
an
evening
gown
of
simple
white
to
the
corsage
of
which
she
had
fastened
a
bunch
of
pink
roses
she
was
to
ellis
a
dazzling
apparition
to
him
her
erect
and
form
was
the
embodiment
of
symmetry
her
voice
sweet
music
her
movements
the
perfection
of
grace
and
it
scarcely
needed
a
lover
imagination
to
read
in
her
fair
countenance
a
pure
heart
and
a
high
spirit
the
truthfulness
that
scorns
a
lie
the
pride
which
is
not
haughtiness
there
were
suggestive
depths
of
tenderness
too
in
the
curl
of
her
lip
the
droop
of
her
long
lashes
the
glance
of
her
blue
eyes
depths
that
ellis
had
long
since
divined
though
he
had
never
yet
explored
them
she
gave
ellis
a
friendly
nod
as
she
came
in
but
for
the
smile
with
which
she
greeted
delamere
ellis
would
have
given
all
that
he
possessed
not
a
great
deal
it
is
true
but
what
could
a
man
do
more
you
are
the
last
one
tom
she
said
reproachfully
ellis
has
been
here
half
an
hour
delamere
threw
a
glance
at
ellis
which
was
not
exactly
friendly
why
should
this
fellow
always
be
on
hand
to
emphasize
his
own
shortcomings
the
rector
is
not
here
answered
tom
triumphantly
you
see
i
am
not
the
last
the
rector
replied
clara
was
called
out
of
town
at
six
this
evening
to
visit
a
dying
man
and
so
can
not
be
here
you
are
the
last
tom
and
ellis
was
the
first
ellis
was
ruefully
aware
that
this
comparison
in
his
favor
was
the
only
visible
advantage
that
he
had
gained
from
his
early
arrival
he
had
not
seen
miss
pemberton
a
moment
sooner
by
reason
of
it
there
had
been
a
certain
satisfaction
in
being
in
the
same
house
with
her
but
delamere
had
arrived
in
time
to
share
or
more
correctly
to
monopolize
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
delamere
gave
a
plausible
excuse
which
won
clara
pardon
and
another
enchanting
smile
which
pierced
ellis
like
a
dagger
he
knew
very
well
that
delamere
excuse
was
a
lie
ellis
himself
had
been
ready
as
early
as
six
but
judging
this
to
be
too
early
had
stopped
in
at
the
clarendon
club
for
half
an
hour
to
look
over
the
magazines
while
coming
out
he
had
glanced
into
the
where
he
had
seen
his
rival
deep
in
a
game
of
cards
from
which
delamere
had
evidently
not
been
able
to
tear
himself
until
the
last
moment
he
had
accounted
for
his
lateness
by
a
story
quite
inconsistent
with
these
facts
the
two
young
people
walked
over
to
a
window
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
large
room
where
they
stood
talking
to
one
another
in
low
tones
the
major
had
left
the
room
for
a
moment
old
delamere
who
was
watching
his
grandson
and
clara
with
an
indulgent
smile
proceeded
to
rub
salt
into
ellis
wounds
they
make
a
handsome
couple
he
observed
i
remember
well
when
her
mother
in
her
youth
an
ideally
beautiful
woman
of
an
excellent
family
married
daniel
pemberton
who
was
not
of
so
good
a
family
but
had
made
money
the
major
who
was
only
a
very
young
man
then
disapproved
of
the
match
he
considered
that
his
mother
although
a
widow
and
nearly
forty
was
marrying
beneath
her
but
he
has
been
a
good
brother
to
clara
and
a
careful
guardian
of
her
estate
ah
young
gentleman
you
can
not
appreciate
except
in
imagination
what
it
means
to
one
standing
on
the
brink
of
eternity
to
feel
sure
that
he
will
live
on
in
his
children
and
his
children
children
ellis
was
appreciating
at
that
moment
what
it
meant
in
cold
blood
with
no
effort
of
the
imagination
to
see
the
girl
whom
he
loved
absorbed
completely
in
another
man
she
had
looked
at
him
only
once
since
tom
delamere
had
entered
the
room
and
then
merely
to
use
him
as
a
spur
with
which
to
prick
his
favored
rival
yes
sir
he
returned
mechanically
miss
clara
is
a
beautiful
young
lady
and
tom
is
a
good
boy
a
fine
boy
returned
the
old
gentleman
i
am
very
well
pleased
with
tom
and
shall
be
entirely
happy
when
i
see
them
married
ellis
could
not
echo
this
sentiment
the
very
thought
of
this
marriage
made
him
miserable
he
had
always
understood
that
the
engagement
was
merely
tentative
a
sort
of
family
understanding
subject
to
confirmation
after
delamere
should
have
attained
his
majority
which
was
still
a
year
off
and
when
the
major
should
think
clara
old
enough
to
marry
ellis
saw
delamere
with
the
eye
of
a
jealous
rival
and
judged
him
mercilessly
whether
correctly
or
not
the
sequel
will
show
he
did
not
at
all
believe
that
tom
delamere
would
make
a
fit
husband
for
clara
pemberton
but
his
opinion
would
have
had
no
weight
he
could
hardly
have
expressed
it
without
showing
his
own
interest
moreover
there
was
no
element
of
the
sneak
in
lee
ellis
the
very
fact
that
he
might
profit
by
the
other
discomfiture
left
delamere
secure
so
far
as
he
could
be
affected
by
anything
that
ellis
might
say
but
ellis
did
not
shrink
from
a
fair
fight
and
though
in
this
one
the
odds
were
heavily
against
him
yet
so
long
as
this
engagement
remained
indefinite
so
long
indeed
as
the
object
of
his
love
was
still
unwed
he
would
not
cease
to
hope
such
a
sacrifice
as
this
marriage
clearly
belonged
in
the
catalogue
of
impossibilities
ellis
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
learn
that
impossibilities
are
merely
things
of
which
we
have
not
learned
or
which
we
do
not
wish
to
happen
sandy
returned
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
dinner
was
announced
delamere
led
the
way
to
the
with
ochiltree
tom
followed
with
clara
the
major
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
came
down
with
carteret
upon
his
arm
her
beauty
rendered
more
delicate
by
the
pallor
of
her
countenance
and
more
complete
by
the
happiness
with
which
it
glowed
ellis
went
in
alone
in
the
rector
absence
it
was
practically
a
family
party
which
sat
down
with
the
exception
of
ellis
who
as
we
have
seen
would
willingly
have
placed
himself
in
the
same
category
the
table
was
tastefully
decorated
with
flowers
which
grew
about
the
house
in
lavish
profusion
in
warm
climates
nature
adorns
herself
with
true
feminine
vanity
what
a
beautiful
table
exclaimed
tom
before
they
were
seated
the
decorations
are
mine
said
clara
proudly
i
cut
the
flowers
and
arranged
them
all
myself
which
accounts
for
the
admirable
effect
rejoined
tom
with
a
bow
before
ellis
to
whom
the
same
thought
had
occurred
was
able
to
express
himself
he
had
always
counted
himself
the
least
envious
of
men
but
for
this
occasion
he
coveted
tom
delamere
readiness
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
observed
old
delamere
with
sententious
gallantry
is
reflected
upon
all
around
them
it
is
a
handsome
company
ochiltree
beamed
upon
the
table
with
a
dry
smile
i
do
perceive
any
effect
that
it
has
upon
you
or
me
she
said
and
as
for
the
young
people
is
as
handsome
does
if
tom
here
for
instance
were
as
good
as
he
looks
you
flatter
me
aunt
polly
tom
broke
in
hastily
anticipating
the
crack
of
the
whip
he
was
familiar
with
his
aunt
conversational
idiosyncrasies
if
you
are
as
good
as
you
look
continued
the
old
lady
with
a
cunning
but
indulgent
smile
some
one
has
been
slandering
you
thanks
aunt
polly
now
you
do
flatter
me
there
is
ellis
ochiltree
went
on
who
is
not
half
so
but
is
steady
as
a
clock
i
dare
say
now
aunt
polly
interposed
carteret
let
the
gentlemen
alone
she
does
mean
half
what
she
says
continued
carteret
apologetically
and
only
talks
that
way
to
people
whom
she
likes
tom
threw
carteret
a
grateful
glance
he
had
been
apprehensive
with
the
sensitiveness
of
youth
lest
his
old
should
make
a
fool
of
him
before
clara
family
nor
had
he
relished
the
comparison
with
ellis
who
was
out
of
place
anyway
in
this
family
party
he
had
never
liked
the
fellow
who
was
too
much
of
a
plodder
and
a
prig
to
make
a
suitable
associate
for
a
young
gentleman
he
tolerated
him
as
a
visitor
at
carteret
and
as
a
member
of
the
clarendon
club
but
that
was
all
ochiltree
has
a
characteristic
way
of
disguising
her
feelings
observed
old
delamere
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
ellis
had
merely
flushed
and
felt
uncomfortable
at
the
reference
to
himself
the
compliment
to
his
character
hardly
offset
the
reflection
upon
his
looks
he
knew
he
was
not
exactly
handsome
but
it
was
not
pleasant
to
have
the
fact
emphasized
in
the
presence
of
the
girl
he
loved
he
would
like
at
least
fair
play
and
judgment
upon
the
subject
left
to
the
young
lady
ochiltree
was
quietly
enjoying
herself
in
early
life
she
had
been
accustomed
to
impale
fools
on
epigrams
like
flies
on
pins
to
see
them
wriggle
but
with
advancing
years
she
had
lost
in
some
measure
the
faculty
of
nice
discrimination
it
was
pleasant
to
see
her
victims
squirm
whether
they
were
fools
or
friends
even
one
friends
she
argued
were
not
always
wise
and
were
sometimes
the
better
for
being
told
the
truth
at
her
niece
table
she
felt
at
liberty
to
speak
her
mind
which
she
invariably
did
with
a
frankness
that
sometimes
bordered
on
brutality
she
had
long
ago
outgrown
the
period
where
ambition
or
passion
or
its
partners
envy
and
hatred
were
springs
of
action
in
her
life
and
simply
retained
a
mild
enjoyment
in
the
exercise
of
an
old
habit
with
no
active
malice
whatever
the
ruling
passion
merely
grew
stronger
as
the
restraining
faculties
decreased
in
vigor
a
diversion
was
created
at
this
point
by
the
appearance
of
old
mammy
jane
dressed
in
a
calico
frock
with
clean
white
neckerchief
and
apron
carrying
the
wonderful
baby
in
honor
of
whose
naming
this
feast
had
been
given
though
only
six
weeks
old
the
little
theodore
had
grown
rapidly
and
mammy
jane
declared
was
already
quite
large
for
his
age
and
displayed
signs
of
an
unusually
precocious
intelligence
he
was
passed
around
the
table
and
duly
admired
clara
thought
his
hair
was
fine
ellis
inquired
about
his
teeth
tom
put
his
finger
in
the
baby
fist
to
test
his
grip
old
delamere
was
unable
to
decide
as
yet
whether
he
favored
most
his
father
or
his
mother
the
object
of
these
attentions
endured
them
patiently
for
several
minutes
and
then
protested
with
a
vocal
vigor
which
led
to
his
being
taken
promptly
back
upstairs
whatever
fate
might
be
in
store
for
him
he
manifested
no
sign
of
weak
lungs
sandy
said
carteret
when
the
baby
had
retired
pass
that
tray
standing
upon
the
side
table
so
that
we
may
all
see
the
presents
delamere
had
brought
a
silver
spoon
and
tom
a
napkin
ring
ellis
had
sent
a
silver
watch
it
was
a
little
premature
he
admitted
but
the
boy
would
grow
to
it
and
could
use
it
to
play
with
in
the
mean
time
it
had
a
glass
back
so
that
he
might
see
the
wheels
go
round
ochiltree
present
was
an
old
and
yellow
ivory
rattle
with
a
handle
which
the
child
could
bite
while
teething
and
a
knob
screwed
on
at
the
end
to
prevent
the
handle
from
slipping
through
the
baby
hand
i
saw
that
in
your
cedar
chest
aunt
polly
said
clara
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
you
used
to
pull
the
chest
out
from
under
your
bed
to
get
me
a
dime
you
kept
the
rattle
in
the
corner
of
the
chest
said
tom
in
the
box
with
the
red
silk
purse
from
which
you
took
the
gold
piece
you
gave
me
every
christmas
a
smile
shone
on
ochiltree
severe
features
at
this
appreciation
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
on
a
snowbank
aunt
polly
chest
is
like
the
widow
cruse
said
carteret
which
was
never
empty
or
fortunatus
purse
which
was
always
full
added
old
delamere
who
read
the
latin
poets
and
whose
allusions
were
apt
to
be
classical
rather
than
scriptural
it
will
last
me
while
i
live
said
ochiltree
adding
cautiously
but
there
not
be
a
great
deal
left
it
wo
take
much
to
support
an
old
woman
for
twenty
years
delamere
man
sandy
had
been
waiting
upon
the
table
with
the
decorum
of
a
trained
butler
and
a
gravity
all
his
own
he
had
changed
his
suit
of
plain
gray
for
a
long
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
which
dated
back
to
the
fashion
of
a
former
generation
with
which
he
wore
a
pair
of
plaid
trousers
of
strikingly
modern
cut
and
pattern
with
his
whiskers
his
spectacles
and
his
solemn
air
of
responsibility
he
would
have
presented
to
one
unfamiliar
with
the
negro
type
an
amusingly
impressive
appearance
but
there
was
nothing
incongruous
about
sandy
to
this
company
except
perhaps
to
tom
delamere
who
possessed
a
keen
eye
for
contrasts
and
always
regarded
sandy
in
that
particular
rig
as
a
very
comical
darkey
is
it
quite
prudent
ochiltree
suggested
the
major
at
a
moment
when
sandy
having
set
down
the
tray
had
left
the
room
for
a
little
while
to
mention
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
that
you
keep
money
in
the
house
i
beg
your
pardon
major
observed
old
delamere
with
a
touch
of
stiffness
the
only
servant
in
hearing
of
the
conversation
has
been
my
own
and
sandy
is
as
honest
as
any
man
in
wellington
you
mean
sir
replied
carteret
with
a
smile
as
honest
as
any
negro
in
wellington
i
make
no
exceptions
major
returned
the
old
gentleman
with
emphasis
i
would
trust
sandy
with
my
life
he
saved
it
once
at
the
risk
of
his
own
no
doubt
mused
the
major
the
negro
is
capable
of
a
certain
doglike
fidelity
i
make
the
comparison
in
a
kindly
sense
a
certain
personal
devotion
which
is
admirable
in
itself
and
fits
him
eminently
for
a
servile
career
i
should
imagine
however
that
one
could
more
safely
trust
his
life
with
a
negro
than
his
portable
property
very
clever
major
i
read
your
paper
and
know
that
your
feeling
is
hostile
toward
the
negro
but
the
major
made
a
gesture
of
dissent
but
remained
courteously
silent
until
delamere
had
finished
for
my
part
the
old
gentleman
went
on
i
think
they
have
done
very
well
considering
what
they
started
from
and
their
limited
opportunities
there
was
adam
miller
for
instance
who
left
a
comfortable
estate
his
son
george
carries
on
the
business
and
the
younger
boy
william
is
a
good
doctor
and
stands
well
with
his
profession
his
hospital
is
a
good
thing
and
if
my
estate
were
clear
i
should
like
to
do
something
for
it
you
are
mistaken
sir
in
imagining
me
hostile
to
the
negro
explained
carteret
on
the
contrary
i
am
friendly
to
his
best
interests
i
give
him
employment
i
pay
taxes
for
schools
to
educate
him
and
for
and
jails
to
keep
him
in
order
i
merely
object
to
being
governed
by
an
inferior
and
servile
race
carteret
face
wore
a
tired
expression
this
question
was
her
husband
hobby
and
therefore
her
own
nightmare
moreover
she
had
her
personal
grievance
against
the
negro
race
and
the
names
mentioned
by
old
delamere
had
brought
it
vividly
before
her
mind
she
had
no
desire
to
mar
the
harmony
of
the
occasion
by
the
discussion
of
a
distasteful
subject
delamere
glancing
at
his
hostess
read
something
of
this
thought
and
refused
the
challenge
to
further
argument
i
do
not
believe
major
he
said
that
olivia
relishes
the
topic
i
merely
wish
to
say
that
sandy
is
an
exception
to
any
rule
which
you
may
formulate
in
derogation
of
the
negro
sandy
is
a
gentleman
in
ebony
tom
could
scarcely
preserve
his
gravity
at
this
characterization
of
old
sandy
with
his
ridiculous
air
of
importance
his
long
blue
coat
and
his
loud
plaid
trousers
that
suit
would
make
a
great
costume
for
a
masquerade
he
would
borrow
it
some
time
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
like
it
well
delamere
returned
the
major
no
doubt
sandy
is
an
exceptionally
good
negro
he
might
well
be
for
he
has
had
the
benefit
of
your
example
all
his
life
and
we
know
that
he
is
a
faithful
servant
but
nevertheless
if
i
were
ochiltree
i
should
put
my
money
in
the
bank
not
all
negroes
are
as
honest
as
sandy
and
an
elderly
lady
might
not
prove
a
match
for
a
burly
black
burglar
thank
you
major
retorted
ochiltree
with
spirit
i
not
yet
too
old
to
take
care
of
myself
that
cedar
chest
has
been
my
bank
for
forty
years
and
i
shall
not
change
my
habits
at
my
age
at
this
moment
sandy
reëntered
the
room
carteret
made
a
warning
gesture
which
ochiltree
chose
not
to
notice
i
proved
a
match
for
two
husbands
and
am
not
afraid
of
any
man
that
walks
the
earth
black
or
white
by
day
or
night
i
have
a
revolver
and
know
how
to
use
it
whoever
attempts
to
rob
me
will
do
so
at
his
peril
after
dinner
clara
played
the
piano
and
sang
duets
with
tom
delamere
at
nine
delamere
carriage
came
for
him
and
he
went
away
accompanied
by
sandy
under
cover
of
the
darkness
the
old
gentleman
leaned
on
his
servant
arm
with
frank
dependence
and
sandy
lifted
him
into
the
carriage
with
every
mark
of
devotion
ellis
had
already
excused
himself
to
go
to
the
office
and
look
over
the
late
proofs
for
the
morning
paper
tom
remained
a
few
minutes
longer
than
his
grandfather
and
upon
taking
his
leave
went
round
to
the
clarendon
club
where
he
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
the
with
a
couple
of
congenial
friends
luck
seemed
to
favor
him
and
he
went
home
at
midnight
with
a
comfortable
balance
of
winnings
he
was
fond
of
excitement
and
found
a
great
deal
of
it
in
cards
to
lose
was
only
less
exciting
than
to
win
of
late
he
had
developed
into
a
very
successful
player
so
successful
indeed
that
several
members
of
the
club
generally
found
excuses
to
avoid
participating
in
a
game
where
he
made
one
iii
the
editor
at
work
to
go
back
a
little
for
several
days
after
his
child
birth
major
carteret
chief
interest
in
life
had
been
confined
to
the
four
walls
of
the
chamber
where
his
pale
wife
lay
upon
her
bed
of
pain
and
those
of
the
adjoining
room
where
an
old
black
woman
crooned
lovingly
over
a
little
white
infant
a
new
element
had
been
added
to
the
consciousness
broadening
the
scope
and
deepening
the
strength
of
his
affections
he
did
not
love
olivia
the
less
for
maternity
had
crowned
her
wifehood
with
an
added
glory
but
side
by
side
with
this
old
and
tried
attachment
was
a
new
passion
stirring
up
dormant
hopes
and
kindling
new
desires
his
regret
had
been
more
than
personal
at
the
thought
that
with
himself
an
old
name
should
be
lost
to
the
state
and
now
all
the
old
pride
of
race
class
and
family
welled
up
anew
and
swelled
and
quickened
the
current
of
his
life
upon
the
major
first
appearance
at
the
office
which
took
place
the
second
day
after
the
child
birth
he
opened
a
box
of
cigars
in
honor
of
the
event
the
word
had
been
passed
around
by
ellis
and
the
whole
office
force
including
reporters
compositors
and
pressmen
came
in
to
congratulate
the
major
and
smoke
at
his
expense
even
jerry
the
colored
porter
mammy
jane
grandson
and
therefore
a
protégé
of
the
family
presented
himself
among
the
rest
or
rather
after
the
rest
the
major
shook
hands
with
them
all
except
jerry
though
he
acknowledged
the
porter
congratulations
with
a
kind
nod
and
put
a
good
cigar
into
his
outstretched
palm
for
which
jerry
thanked
him
without
manifesting
any
consciousness
of
the
omission
he
was
quite
aware
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
major
would
not
have
shaken
hands
with
white
workingmen
to
say
nothing
of
negroes
and
he
had
merely
hoped
that
in
the
pleasurable
distraction
of
the
moment
the
major
might
also
overlook
the
distinction
of
color
jerry
hope
had
been
shattered
though
not
rudely
for
the
major
had
spoken
pleasantly
and
the
cigar
was
a
good
one
ellis
had
once
shaken
hands
with
jerry
but
ellis
was
a
young
man
whose
quaker
father
had
never
owned
any
slaves
and
he
could
not
be
expected
to
have
as
much
pride
as
one
of
the
best
quality
whose
families
had
possessed
land
and
negroes
for
time
out
of
mind
on
the
whole
jerry
preferred
the
careless
nod
of
the
to
the
more
familiar
greeting
of
the
subaltern
having
finished
this
pleasant
ceremony
which
left
him
with
a
comfortable
sense
of
his
new
dignity
the
major
turned
to
his
desk
it
had
been
much
neglected
during
the
week
and
more
than
one
matter
claimed
his
attention
but
as
typical
of
the
new
trend
of
his
thoughts
the
first
subject
he
took
up
was
one
bearing
upon
the
future
of
his
son
quite
obviously
the
career
of
a
carteret
must
not
be
left
to
chance
it
must
be
planned
and
worked
out
with
a
due
sense
of
the
value
of
good
blood
there
lay
upon
his
desk
a
letter
from
a
promoter
offering
the
major
an
investment
which
promised
large
returns
though
several
years
must
elapse
before
the
enterprise
could
be
put
upon
a
paying
basis
the
element
of
time
however
was
not
immediately
important
the
morning
chronicle
provided
him
an
ample
income
the
money
available
for
this
investment
was
part
of
his
wife
patrimony
it
was
invested
in
a
local
cotton
mill
which
was
paying
ten
per
but
this
was
a
beggarly
return
compared
with
the
immense
profits
promised
by
the
offered
investment
profits
which
would
enable
his
son
upon
reaching
manhood
to
take
a
place
in
the
world
commensurate
with
the
dignity
of
his
ancestors
one
of
whom
only
a
few
generations
removed
had
owned
an
estate
of
ninety
thousand
acres
of
land
and
six
thousand
slaves
this
letter
having
been
disposed
of
by
an
answer
accepting
the
offer
the
major
took
up
his
pen
to
write
an
editorial
public
affairs
in
the
state
were
not
going
to
his
satisfaction
at
the
last
state
election
his
own
party
after
an
almost
unbroken
rule
of
twenty
years
had
been
defeated
by
the
fusion
ticket
a
combination
of
republicans
and
populists
a
clean
sweep
had
been
made
of
the
offices
in
the
state
which
were
now
filled
by
new
men
many
of
the
smaller
places
had
gone
to
colored
men
their
people
having
voted
almost
solidly
for
the
fusion
ticket
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
population
of
wellington
was
two
thirds
colored
this
state
of
things
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
the
defeated
party
of
which
the
morning
chronicle
was
the
acknowledged
organ
major
carteret
shared
this
feeling
only
this
very
morning
while
passing
the
city
hall
on
his
way
to
the
office
he
had
seen
the
steps
of
that
noble
building
disfigured
by
a
fringe
of
negroes
for
all
the
world
to
use
a
local
simile
like
a
string
of
buzzards
sitting
on
a
rail
awaiting
their
opportunity
to
batten
upon
the
helpless
corpse
of
a
moribund
city
taking
for
his
theme
the
unfitness
of
the
negro
to
participate
in
government
an
unfitness
due
to
his
limited
education
his
lack
of
experience
his
criminal
tendencies
and
more
especially
to
his
hopeless
mental
and
physical
inferiority
to
the
white
race
the
major
had
demonstrated
it
seemed
to
him
clearly
enough
that
the
ballot
in
the
hands
of
the
negro
was
a
menace
to
the
commonwealth
he
had
argued
with
entire
conviction
that
the
white
and
black
races
could
never
attain
social
and
political
harmony
by
commingling
their
blood
he
had
proved
by
several
historical
parallels
that
no
two
unassimilable
races
could
ever
live
together
except
in
the
relation
of
superior
and
inferior
and
he
was
just
dipping
his
gold
pen
into
the
ink
to
indite
his
conclusions
from
the
premises
thus
established
when
jerry
the
porter
announced
two
visitors
belmont
an
mcbane
would
like
ter
see
you
suh
show
them
in
jerry
the
man
who
entered
first
upon
this
invitation
was
a
dapper
little
gentleman
with
eyes
and
a
vandyke
beard
he
wore
a
frock
coat
patent
leather
shoes
and
a
panama
hat
there
were
about
his
eyes
which
twinkled
with
a
hard
and
at
times
humorous
shrewdness
he
had
sloping
shoulders
small
hands
and
feet
and
walked
with
the
leisurely
step
characteristic
of
those
who
have
been
reared
under
hot
suns
carteret
gave
his
hand
cordially
to
the
gentleman
thus
described
how
do
you
do
captain
mcbane
he
said
turning
to
the
second
visitor
the
individual
thus
addressed
was
strikingly
different
in
appearance
from
his
companion
his
broad
shoulders
burly
form
square
jaw
and
heavy
chin
betokened
strength
energy
and
unscrupulousness
with
the
exception
of
a
small
bristling
mustache
his
face
was
clean
shaven
with
here
and
there
a
speck
of
dried
blood
due
to
a
carelessly
or
unskillfully
handled
razor
a
single
gray
eye
was
shadowed
by
a
beetling
brow
over
which
a
crop
of
coarse
black
hair
slightly
streaked
with
gray
fell
almost
low
enough
to
mingle
with
his
black
bushy
eyebrows
his
coat
had
not
been
brushed
for
several
days
if
one
might
judge
from
the
accumulation
of
dandruff
upon
the
collar
and
his
in
the
middle
of
which
blazed
a
showy
diamond
was
plentifully
stained
with
tobacco
juice
he
wore
a
large
slouch
hat
which
upon
entering
the
office
he
removed
and
held
in
his
hand
having
greeted
this
person
with
an
unconscious
but
quite
perceptible
diminution
of
the
warmth
with
which
he
had
welcomed
the
other
the
major
looked
around
the
room
for
seats
for
his
visitors
and
perceiving
only
one
chair
piled
with
exchanges
and
a
broken
stool
propped
against
the
wall
pushed
a
button
which
rang
a
bell
in
the
hall
summoning
the
colored
porter
to
his
presence
jerry
said
the
editor
when
his
servant
appeared
bring
a
couple
of
chairs
for
these
gentlemen
while
they
stood
waiting
the
visitors
congratulated
the
major
on
the
birth
of
his
child
which
had
been
announced
in
the
morning
chronicle
and
which
the
prominence
of
the
family
made
in
some
degree
a
matter
of
public
interest
and
now
that
you
have
a
son
major
remarked
the
gentleman
first
described
as
he
lit
one
of
the
major
cigars
you
be
all
the
more
interested
in
doing
something
to
make
this
town
fit
to
live
in
which
is
what
we
came
up
to
talk
about
things
are
in
an
awful
condition
a
negro
justice
of
the
peace
has
opened
an
office
on
market
street
and
only
yesterday
summoned
a
white
man
to
appear
before
him
negro
lawyers
get
most
of
the
business
in
the
criminal
court
last
evening
a
group
of
young
white
ladies
going
quietly
along
the
street
were
forced
off
the
sidewalk
by
a
crowd
of
negro
girls
coming
down
the
street
just
now
i
saw
a
spectacle
of
social
equality
and
negro
domination
that
made
my
blood
boil
with
indignation
a
white
and
a
black
convict
chained
together
crossing
the
city
in
charge
of
a
negro
officer
we
can
not
stand
that
sort
of
thing
carteret
it
is
the
last
straw
something
must
be
done
and
that
quickly
the
major
thrilled
with
responsive
emotion
there
was
something
prophetic
in
this
opportune
visit
the
matter
was
not
only
in
his
own
thoughts
but
in
the
air
it
was
the
spontaneous
revulsion
of
white
men
against
the
rule
of
an
inferior
race
these
were
the
very
men
above
all
others
in
the
town
to
join
him
in
a
movement
to
change
these
degrading
conditions
general
belmont
the
smaller
of
the
two
was
a
man
of
good
family
a
lawyer
by
profession
and
took
an
active
part
in
state
and
local
politics
aristocratic
by
birth
and
instinct
and
a
former
owner
of
slaves
his
conception
of
the
obligations
and
rights
of
his
caste
was
nevertheless
somewhat
lower
than
that
of
the
narrower
but
more
sincere
carteret
in
serious
affairs
carteret
desired
the
approval
of
his
conscience
even
if
he
had
to
trick
that
docile
organ
into
acquiescence
this
was
not
difficult
to
do
in
politics
for
he
believed
in
the
divine
right
of
white
men
and
gentlemen
as
his
ancestors
had
believed
in
and
died
for
the
divine
right
of
kings
general
belmont
was
not
without
a
gentleman
distaste
for
meanness
but
he
permitted
no
fine
scruples
to
stand
in
the
way
of
success
he
had
once
been
minister
under
a
democratic
administration
to
a
small
central
american
state
political
rivals
had
characterized
him
as
a
tricky
demagogue
which
may
of
course
have
been
a
libel
he
had
an
amiable
disposition
possessed
the
gift
of
eloquence
and
was
a
prime
social
favorite
captain
george
mcbane
had
sprung
from
the
class
to
which
even
more
than
to
the
slaves
the
abolition
of
slavery
had
opened
the
door
of
opportunity
no
longer
overshadowed
by
a
slaveholding
caste
some
of
this
class
had
rapidly
pushed
themselves
forward
some
had
made
honorable
records
others
foremost
in
and
election
frauds
had
done
the
dirty
work
of
politics
as
their
fathers
had
done
that
of
slavery
seeking
their
reward
at
first
in
minor
offices
for
which
men
of
gentler
breeding
did
not
care
until
their
ambition
began
to
reach
out
for
higher
honors
of
this
class
mcbane
whose
captaincy
by
the
way
was
merely
a
polite
fiction
had
been
one
of
the
most
successful
he
had
held
until
recently
as
the
reward
of
questionable
political
services
a
contract
with
the
state
for
its
convict
labor
from
which
in
a
few
years
he
had
realized
a
fortune
but
the
methods
which
made
his
contract
profitable
had
not
commended
themselves
to
humane
people
and
charges
of
cruelty
and
worse
had
been
preferred
against
him
he
was
rich
enough
to
escape
serious
consequences
from
the
investigation
which
followed
but
when
the
fusion
ticket
carried
the
state
he
lost
his
contract
and
the
system
of
convict
labor
was
abolished
since
then
mcbane
had
devoted
himself
to
politics
he
was
ambitious
for
greater
wealth
for
office
and
for
social
recognition
a
man
of
few
words
and
he
seldom
spoke
of
his
aspirations
except
where
speech
might
favor
them
preferring
to
seek
his
ends
by
secret
deals
and
combinations
rather
than
to
challenge
criticism
and
provoke
rivalry
by
more
open
methods
at
sight
therefore
of
these
two
men
with
whose
careers
and
characters
he
was
entirely
familiar
carteret
felt
sweep
over
his
mind
the
conviction
that
now
was
the
time
and
these
the
instruments
with
which
to
undertake
the
redemption
of
the
state
from
the
evil
fate
which
had
befallen
it
jerry
the
porter
who
had
gone
downstairs
to
the
to
find
two
whole
chairs
now
entered
with
one
in
each
hand
he
set
a
chair
for
the
general
who
gave
him
an
amiable
nod
to
which
jerry
responded
with
a
bow
and
a
scrape
captain
mcbane
made
no
acknowledgment
but
fixed
jerry
so
fiercely
with
his
single
eye
that
upon
placing
the
chair
jerry
made
his
escape
from
the
room
as
rapidly
as
possible

muttered
upon

i

after
this
fervent
aspiration
having
nothing
else
to
do
for
the
time
being
except
to
remain
within
call
and
having
caught
a
few
words
of
the
conversation
as
he
went
in
with
the
chairs
jerry
who
possessed
a
certain
amount
of
curiosity
placed
close
to
the
wall
the
broken
stool
upon
which
he
sat
while
waiting
in
the
hall
and
applied
his
ear
to
a
hole
in
the
plastering
of
the
hallway
there
was
a
similar
defect
in
the
inner
wall
between
the
same
two
pieces
of
studding
and
while
this
inner
opening
was
not
exactly
opposite
the
outer
jerry
was
enabled
through
the
two
to
catch
in
a
more
or
less
fragmentary
way
what
was
going
on
within
he
could
hear
the
major
now
and
then
use
the
word
negro
and
mcbane
deep
voice
was
quite
audible
when
he
referred
it
seemed
to
jerry
with
alarming
frequency
to
the
damned
niggers
while
the
general
suave
tones
now
and
then
pronounced
the
word
niggro
a
sort
of
compromise
between
ethnology
and
the
vernacular
that
the
gentlemen
were
talking
politics
seemed
quite
likely
for
gentlemen
generally
talked
politics
when
they
met
at
the
chronicle
office
jerry
could
hear
the
words
vote
franchise
eliminate
constitution
and
other
expressions
which
marked
the
general
tenor
of
the
talk
though
he
could
not
follow
it
all
partly
because
he
could
not
hear
everything
distinctly
and
partly
because
of
certain
limitations
which
nature
had
placed
in
the
way
of
jerry
understanding
anything
very
difficult
or
abstruse
he
had
gathered
enough
however
to
realize
in
a
vague
way
that
something
serious
was
on
foot
involving
his
own
race
when
a
bell
sounded
over
his
head
at
which
he
sprang
up
hastily
and
entered
the
room
where
the
gentlemen
were
talking
jerry
said
the
major
wait
on
captain
mcbane
yas
suh
responded
jerry
turning
toward
the
captain
whose
eye
he
carefully
avoided
meeting
directly
take
that
half
a
dollar
boy
ordered
mcbane
an
go
the
street
to
sykes
and
tell
him
to
send
me
three
whiskies
bring
back
the
change
and
make
the
captain
tossed
the
half
dollar
at
jerry
who
looking
to
one
side
of
course
missed
it
he
picked
the
money
up
however
and
backed
out
of
the
room
jerry
did
not
like
captain
mcbane
to
begin
with
and
it
was
clear
that
the
captain
was
no
gentleman
or
he
would
not
have
thrown
the
money
at
him
considering
the
source
jerry
might
have
overlooked
this
discourtesy
had
it
not
been
coupled
with
the
remark
about
the
change
which
seemed
to
him
in
very
poor
taste
returning
in
a
few
minutes
with
three
glasses
on
a
tray
he
passed
them
round
handed
captain
mcbane
his
change
and
retired
to
the
hall
gentlemen
exclaimed
the
captain
lifting
his
glass
i
propose
a
toast
nigger
domination
amen
said
the
others
and
three
glasses
were
solemnly
drained
major
observed
the
general
smacking
his
lips
should
like
to
use
jerry
for
a
moment
if
you
will
permit
me
jerry
appeared
promptly
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
he
had
remained
conveniently
near
calls
of
this
sort
were
apt
to
come
in
sequence
jerry
said
the
general
handing
jerry
half
a
dollar
go
over
to
brown
i
get
my
liquor
there
and
tell
them
to
send

glasses
of

special
mixture

keep
the
change
thank

replied
jerry
with
unctuous
gratitude
bending
almost
double
as
he
backed
out
of
the
room
dat
a
a
rale
he
said
to
himself
when
he
had
closed
the
door

observed
the
general
when
jerry
had
returned
with
the
glasses

originally
compounded
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
great
john

confided

added
mcbane
with
fervor
now
and
forever
concluded
carteret
solemnly
when
the
visitors
half
an
hour
later
had
taken
their
departure
carteret
inspired
by
the
theme
and
in
less
degree
by
the
famous
mixture
of
the
immortal
calhoun
turned
to
his
desk
and
finished
at
a
white
heat
his
famous
editorial
in
which
he
sounded
the
tocsin
of
a
new
crusade
at
noon
when
the
editor
having
laid
down
his
pen
was
leaving
the
office
he
passed
jerry
in
the
hall
without
a
word
or
a
nod
the
major
wore
a
rapt
look
which
jerry
observed
with
a
vague
uneasiness
he
looks

the

do

need

for
anything
asked
the
young
nurse
who
had
stood
before
carteret
giving
mammy
jane
a
mere
passing
glance
and
listening
impassively
to
her
harangue
the
nurse
belonged
to
the
younger
generation
of
colored
people
she
had
graduated
from
the
mission
school
and
had
received
some
instruction
in
miller
class
for
nurses
standing
like
most
young
people
of
her
race
on
the
border
line
between
two
irreconcilable
states
of
life
she
had
neither
the
picturesqueness
of
the
slave
nor
the
unconscious
dignity
of
those
of
whom
freedom
has
been
the
immemorial
birthright
she
was
in
what
might
be
called
the
stage
through
which
races
as
well
as
individuals
must
pass
in
climbing
the
ladder
of
life
not
an
interesting
at
least
not
an
agreeable
stage
but
an
inevitable
one
and
for
that
reason
entitled
to
a
paragraph
in
a
story
of
southern
life
which
with
its
as
yet
imperfect
blending
of
old
with
new
of
race
with
race
of
slavery
with
freedom
is
like
no
other
life
under
the
sun
had
this
old
woman
who
had
no
authority
over
her
been
a
little
more
polite
or
a
little
less
offensive
the
nurse
might
have
returned
her
a
pleasant
answer
these
negroes
she
said
to
herself
made
her
sick
with
their
slavering
over
the
white
folks
who
she
supposed
favored
them
and
made
much
of
them
because
they
had
once
belonged
to
them
much
the
same
reason
why
they
fondled
their
cats
and
dogs
for
her
own
part
they
gave
her
nothing
but
her
wages
and
small
wages
at
that
and
she
owed
them
nothing
more
than
equivalent
service
it
was
purely
a
matter
of
business
she
sold
her
time
for
their
money
there
was
no
question
of
love
between
them
receiving
a
negative
answer
from
carteret
she
left
the
room
without
a
word
ignoring
mammy
jane
completely
and
leaving
that
venerable
relic
of
times
gasping
in
helpless
astonishment
well
i
nevuh
she
ejaculated
as
soon
as
she
could
get
her
breath
ef
dat
ain
de
beatinis
i
ever
seed
er
heared
of
dese

rispec
fer

age
i
know
i
don
know
now
what
are
you
croaking
about
jane
asked
major
carteret
who
came
into
the
room
and
took
the
child
into
his
arms
mammy
jane
hobbled
to
her
feet
and
bobbed
a
curtsy
she
was
never
lacking
in
respect
to
white
people
of
proper
quality
but
major
carteret
the
quintessence
of
aristocracy
called
out
all
her
reserves
of
deference
the
major
was
always
kind
and
considerate
to
these
old
family
retainers
brought
up
in
the
feudal
atmosphere
now
so
rapidly
passing
away
mammy
jane
loved
carteret
toward
the
major
she
entertained
a
feeling
bordering
upon
awe
well
jane
returned
the
major
sadly
when
the
old
nurse
had
related
her
grievance
the
old
times
have
vanished
the
old
ties
have
been
ruptured
the
old
relations
of
dependence
and
loyal
obedience
on
the
part
of
the
colored
people
the
responsibility
of
protection
and
kindness
upon
that
of
the
whites
have
passed
away
forever
the
young
negroes
are
too
education
is
spoiling
them
jane
they
have
been
badly
taught
they
are
not
content
with
their
station
in
life
some
time
they
will
overstep
the
mark
the
white
people
are
patient
but
there
is
a
limit
to
their
endurance
dat
i
tells
dese
young

groaned
mammy
jane
with
a
portentous
shake
of
her
turbaned
head

dey

if
all
the
colored
people
were
like
you
and
jerry
jane
rejoined
the
major
kindly
there
would
never
be
any
trouble
you
have
friends
upon
whom
in
time
of
need
you
can
rely
implicitly
for
protection
and
succor
you
served
your
mistress
faithfully
before
the
war
you
remained
by
her
when
the
other
negroes
were
running
hither
and
thither
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
and
you
have
transferred
your
allegiance
to
my
wife
and
her
child
we
think
a
great
deal
of
you
jane
yes
indeed
mammy
jane
assented
carteret
with
sincere
affection
glancing
with
moist
eyes
from
the
child
in
her
husband
arms
to
the
old
nurse
whose
dark
face
was
glowing
with
happiness
at
these
expressions
of
appreciation
you
shall
never
want
so
long
as
we
have
anything
we
would
share
our
last
crust
with
you
thank
y
mis
said
jane
with
reciprocal
emotion
i
knows
who
my

but
fer
de
lawd
sake
mars
philip
gim
me
dat
chile
an
lem
me
pat
on
de
back
er
he
choke
ter
death
the
old
nurse
had
been
the
first
to
observe
that
little
dodie
for
some
reason
was
gasping
for
breath
catching
the
child
from
the
arms
she
patted
it
on
the
back
and
shook
it
gently
after
a
moment
of
this
treatment
the
child
ceased
to
gasp
but
still
breathed
heavily
with
a
strange
whistling
noise
oh
my
child
exclaimed
the
mother
in
great
alarm
taking
the
baby
in
her
own
arms
what
can
be
the
matter
with
him
mammy
jane
fer
de
lawd
sake
i
don
know
he
swallered
somethin
an
he
ain
had
nothin
in
his
han
but
de
rattle
mis
polly
give
carteret
caught
up
the
ivory
rattle
which
hung
suspended
by
a
ribbon
from
the
baby
neck
he
has
swallowed
the
little
piece
off
the
end
of
the
handle
she
cried
turning
pale
with
fear
and
it
has
lodged
in
his
throat
telephone
price
to
come
immediately
philip
before
my
baby
chokes
to
death
oh
my
baby
my
precious
baby
an
anxious
half
hour
passed
during
which
the
child
lay
quiet
except
for
its
labored
breathing
the
suspense
was
relieved
by
the
arrival
of
price
who
examined
the
child
carefully
it
a
curious
accident
he
announced
at
the
close
of
his
inspection
so
far
as
i
can
discover
the
piece
of
ivory
has
been
drawn
into
the
trachea
or
windpipe
and
has
lodged
in
the
mouth
of
the
right
bronchus
i
try
to
get
it
out
without
an
operation
but
i
ca
guarantee
the
result
at
the
end
of
another
half
hour
price
announced
his
inability
to
remove
the
obstruction
without
resorting
to
more
serious
measures
i
do
not
see
he
declared
how
an
operation
can
be
avoided
will
it
be
dangerous
inquired
the
major
anxiously
while
carteret
shivered
at
the
thought
it
will
be
necessary
to
cut
into
his
throat
from
the
outside
all
such
operations
are
more
or
less
dangerous
especially
on
small
children
if
this
were
some
other
child
i
might
undertake
the
operation
unassisted
but
i
know
how
you
value
this
one
major
and
i
should
prefer
to
share
the
responsibility
with
a
specialist
is
there
one
in
town
asked
the
major
no
but
we
can
get
one
from
out
of
town
send
for
the
best
one
in
the
country
said
the
major
who
can
be
got
here
in
time
spare
no
expense
price
we
value
this
child
above
any
earthly
thing
the
best
is
the
safest
replied
price
i
will
send
for
burns
of
philadelphia
the
best
surgeon
in
that
line
in
america
if
he
can
start
at
once
he
can
reach
here
in
sixteen
or
eighteen
hours
and
the
case
can
wait
even
longer
if
inflammation
does
not
set
in
the
message
was
dispatched
forthwith
by
rare
good
fortune
the
eminent
specialist
was
able
to
start
within
an
hour
or
two
after
the
receipt
of
price
telegram
meanwhile
the
baby
remained
restless
and
uneasy
the
doctor
spending
most
of
his
time
by
its
side
carteret
who
had
never
been
quite
strong
since
the
child
birth
was
a
prey
to
the
most
agonizing
apprehensions
mammy
jane
while
not
presuming
to
question
the
opinion
of
price
and
not
wishing
to
add
to
her
mistress
distress
was
secretly
oppressed
by
forebodings
which
she
was
unable
to
shake
off
the
child
was
born
for
bad
luck
the
mole
under
its
ear
just
at
the
point
where
the
hangman
knot
would
strike
had
foreshadowed
dire
misfortune
she
had
already
observed
several
little
things
which
had
rendered
her
vaguely
anxious
for
instance
upon
one
occasion
on
entering
the
room
where
the
baby
had
been
left
alone
asleep
in
his
crib
she
had
met
a
strange
cat
hurrying
from
the
nursery
and
upon
examining
closely
the
pillow
upon
which
the
child
lay
had
found
a
depression
which
had
undoubtedly
been
due
to
the
weight
of
the
cat
body
the
child
was
restless
and
uneasy
and
jane
had
ever
since
believed
that
the
cat
had
been
sucking
little
breath
with
what
might
have
been
fatal
results
had
she
not
appeared
just
in
the
nick
of
time
this
untimely
accident
of
the
rattle
a
fatality
for
which
no
one
could
be
held
responsible
had
confirmed
the
unlucky
omen
jane
duties
in
the
nursery
did
not
permit
her
to
visit
her
friend
the
conjure
woman
but
she
did
find
time
to
go
out
in
the
back
yard
at
dusk
and
to
dig
up
the
charm
which
she
had
planted
there
it
had
protected
the
child
so
far
but
perhaps
its
potency
had
become
exhausted
she
picked
up
the
bottle
shook
it
vigorously
and
then
laid
it
back
with
the
other
side
up
refilling
the
hole
she
made
a
cross
over
the
top
with
the
thumb
of
her
left
hand
and
walked
three
times
around
it
what
this
strange
symbolism
meant
or
whence
it
derived
its
origin
aunt
jane
did
not
know
the
cross
was
there
and
the
trinity
though
jane
was
scarcely
conscious
of
these
at
this
moment
as
religious
emblems
but
she
hoped
on
general
principles
that
this
performance
would
strengthen
the
charm
and
restore
little
dodie
luck
it
certainly
had
its
moral
effect
upon
jane
own
mind
for
she
was
able
to
sleep
better
and
contrived
to
impress
carteret
with
her
own
hopefulness
v
a
journey
southward
as
the
train
was
leaving
the
station
at
philadelphia
a
gentleman
took
his
seat
in
the
single
attached
to
the
train
and
proceeded
to
make
himself
comfortable
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
opened
his
newspaper
in
which
he
remained
absorbed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
train
had
left
the
city
behind
he
threw
the
paper
aside
and
looked
around
at
the
other
occupants
of
the
car
one
of
these
who
had
been
on
the
car
since
it
had
left
new
york
rose
from
his
seat
upon
perceiving
the
other
glance
and
came
down
the
aisle
how
do
you
do
dr
burns
he
said
stopping
beside
the
seat
of
the
philadelphia
passenger
the
gentleman
looked
up
at
the
speaker
with
an
air
of
surprise
which
after
the
first
keen
incisive
glance
gave
place
to
an
expression
of
cordial
recognition
why
it
miller
he
exclaimed
rising
and
giving
the
other
his
hand
william
miller
miller
of
course
sit
down
miller
and
tell
me
all
about
yourself
what
you
doing
where
you
been
and
where
you
going
i
delighted
to
meet
you
and
to
see
you
looking
so
well
and
so
prosperous
i
deserve
no
credit
for
either
sir
returned
the
other
as
he
took
the
proffered
seat
for
i
inherited
both
health
and
prosperity
it
is
a
fortunate
chance
that
permits
me
to
meet
you
the
two
acquaintances
thus
opportunely
thrown
together
so
that
they
might
while
away
in
conversation
the
tedium
of
their
journey
represented
very
different
and
yet
very
similar
types
of
manhood
a
celebrated
traveler
after
many
years
spent
in
barbarous
or
savage
lands
has
said
that
among
all
varieties
of
mankind
the
similarities
are
vastly
more
important
and
fundamental
than
the
differences
looking
at
these
two
men
with
the
american
eye
the
differences
would
perhaps
be
the
more
striking
or
at
least
the
more
immediately
apparent
for
the
first
was
white
and
the
second
black
or
more
correctly
speaking
brown
it
was
even
a
light
brown
but
both
his
swarthy
complexion
and
his
curly
hair
revealed
what
has
been
described
in
the
laws
of
some
of
our
states
as
a
visible
admixture
of
african
blood
having
disposed
of
this
difference
and
having
observed
that
the
white
man
was
perhaps
fifty
years
of
age
and
the
other
not
more
than
thirty
it
may
be
said
that
they
were
both
tall
and
sturdy
both
well
dressed
the
white
man
with
perhaps
a
little
more
distinction
both
seemed
from
their
faces
and
their
manners
to
be
men
of
culture
and
accustomed
to
the
society
of
cultivated
people
they
were
both
handsome
men
the
elder
representing
a
fine
type
of
as
the
term
is
used
in
speaking
of
our
composite
white
population
while
the
mulatto
erect
form
broad
shoulders
clear
eyes
fine
teeth
and
pleasingly
moulded
features
showed
nowhere
any
sign
of
that
degeneration
which
the
pessimist
so
sadly
maintains
is
the
inevitable
heritage
of
mixed
races
as
to
their
personal
relations
it
has
already
appeared
that
they
were
members
of
the
same
profession
in
past
years
they
had
been
teacher
and
pupil
alvin
burns
was
professor
in
the
famous
medical
college
where
miller
had
attended
lectures
the
professor
had
taken
an
interest
in
his
only
colored
pupil
to
whom
he
had
been
attracted
by
his
earnestness
of
purpose
his
evident
talent
and
his
excellent
manners
and
fine
physique
it
was
in
part
due
to
burns
friendship
that
miller
had
won
a
scholarship
which
had
enabled
him
without
drawing
too
heavily
upon
his
father
resources
to
spend
in
europe
studying
in
the
hospitals
of
paris
and
vienna
the
two
most
delightful
years
of
his
life
the
same
influence
had
strengthened
his
natural
inclination
toward
operative
surgery
in
which
burns
was
a
distinguished
specialist
of
national
reputation
miller
father
adam
miller
had
been
a
thrifty
colored
man
the
son
of
a
slave
who
in
the
olden
time
had
bought
himself
with
money
which
he
had
earned
and
saved
over
and
above
what
he
had
paid
his
master
for
his
time
adam
miller
had
inherited
his
father
thrift
as
well
as
his
trade
which
was
that
of
a
stevedore
or
contractor
for
the
loading
and
unloading
of
vessels
at
the
port
of
wellington
in
the
flush
turpentine
days
following
a
few
years
after
the
civil
war
he
had
made
money
his
savings
shrewdly
invested
had
by
constant
accessions
become
a
competence
he
had
brought
up
his
eldest
son
to
the
trade
the
other
he
had
given
a
professional
education
in
the
proud
hope
that
his
children
or
his
grandchildren
might
be
gentlemen
in
the
town
where
their
ancestors
had
once
been
slaves
upon
his
father
death
shortly
after
miller
return
from
europe
and
a
year
or
two
before
the
date
at
which
this
story
opens
he
had
promptly
spent
part
of
his
inheritance
in
founding
a
hospital
to
which
was
to
be
added
a
training
school
for
nurses
and
in
time
perhaps
a
medical
college
and
a
school
of
pharmacy
he
had
been
strongly
tempted
to
leave
the
south
and
seek
a
home
for
his
family
and
a
career
for
himself
in
the
freer
north
where
race
antagonism
was
less
keen
or
at
least
less
oppressive
or
in
europe
where
he
had
never
found
his
color
work
to
his
disadvantage
but
his
people
had
needed
him
and
he
had
wished
to
help
them
and
had
sought
by
means
of
this
institution
to
contribute
to
their
uplifting
as
he
now
informed
burns
he
was
returning
from
new
york
where
he
had
been
in
order
to
purchase
equipment
for
his
new
hospital
which
would
soon
be
ready
for
the
reception
of
patients
how
much
i
can
accomplish
i
do
not
know
said
miller
but
i
do
what
i
can
there
are
eight
or
nine
million
of
us
and
it
will
take
a
great
deal
of
learning
of
all
kinds
to
leaven
that
lump
it
is
a
great
problem
miller
the
future
of
your
race
returned
the
other
a
tremendously
interesting
problem
it
is
a
serial
story
which
we
are
all
reading
and
which
grows
in
vital
interest
with
each
successive
installment
it
is
not
only
your
problem
but
ours
your
race
must
come
up
or
drag
ours
down
we
shall
come
up
declared
miller
slowly
and
painfully
perhaps
but
we
shall
win
our
way
if
our
race
had
made
as
much
progress
everywhere
as
they
have
made
in
wellington
the
problem
would
be
well
on
the
way
toward
solution
wellington
exclaimed
burns
that
where
i
going
a
price
of
wellington
has
sent
for
me
to
perform
an
operation
on
a
throat
do
you
know
dr
price
quite
well
replied
miller
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
so
much
the
better
i
shall
want
you
to
assist
me
i
read
in
the
medical
gazette
the
other
day
an
account
of
a
very
interesting
operation
of
yours
i
felt
proud
to
number
you
among
my
pupils
it
was
a
remarkable
case
a
rare
case
i
must
certainly
have
you
with
me
in
this
one
i
shall
be
delighted
sir
returned
miller
if
it
is
agreeable
to
all
concerned
several
hours
were
passed
in
pleasant
conversation
while
the
train
sped
rapidly
southward
they
were
already
far
down
in
virginia
and
had
stopped
at
a
station
beyond
richmond
when
the
conductor
entered
the
car
all
passengers
he
announced
will
please
transfer
to
the
day
coaches
ahead
the
sleeper
has
a
hot
box
and
must
be
switched
off
here
burns
and
miller
obeyed
the
order
the
former
leading
the
way
into
the
coach
immediately
in
front
of
the
let
sit
here
miller
he
said
having
selected
a
seat
near
the
rear
of
the
car
and
deposited
his
suitcase
in
a
rack
it
on
the
shady
side
miller
stood
a
moment
hesitatingly
but
finally
took
the
seat
indicated
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
journey
was
again
resumed
when
the
train
conductor
made
his
round
after
leaving
the
station
he
paused
at
the
seat
occupied
by
the
two
doctors
glanced
interrogatively
at
miller
and
then
spoke
to
burns
who
sat
in
the
end
of
the
seat
nearest
the
aisle
this
man
is
with
you
he
asked
indicating
miller
with
a
slight
side
movement
of
his
head
and
a
keen
glance
in
his
direction
certainly
replied
burns
curtly
and
with
some
surprise
you
see
that
he
is
the
conductor
passed
on
miller
paid
no
apparent
attention
to
this
little
interlude
though
no
syllable
had
escaped
him
he
resumed
the
conversation
where
it
had
been
broken
off
but
nevertheless
followed
with
his
eyes
the
conductor
who
stopped
at
a
seat
near
the
forward
end
of
the
car
and
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
man
whom
miller
had
not
hitherto
noticed
as
this
passenger
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
toward
miller
the
latter
saw
a
burly
white
man
and
recognized
in
his
jaw
his
coarse
firm
mouth
and
the
single
gray
eye
with
which
he
swept
miller
for
an
instant
with
a
scornful
glance
a
character
of
wellington
with
whom
the
reader
has
already
made
acquaintance
in
these
pages
captain
mcbane
wore
a
frock
coat
and
a
slouch
hat
several
buttons
of
his
vest
were
unbuttoned
and
his
solitaire
diamond
blazed
in
his
soiled
like
the
headlight
of
a
locomotive
the
conductor
in
his
turn
looked
back
at
miller
and
retraced
his
steps
miller
braced
himself
for
what
he
feared
was
coming
though
he
had
hoped
on
account
of
his
friend
presence
that
it
might
be
avoided
excuse
me
sir
said
the
conductor
addressing
burns
but
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
man
was
your
servant
no
indeed
replied
burns
indignantly
the
gentleman
is
not
my
servant
nor
anybody
servant
but
is
my
friend
but
by
the
way
since
we
are
on
the
subject
may
i
ask
what
affair
it
is
of
yours
it
very
much
my
affair
returned
the
conductor
somewhat
nettled
at
this
questioning
of
his
authority
i
sorry
to
part
but
the
law
of
virginia
does
not
permit
colored
passengers
to
ride
in
the
white
cars
you
have
to
go
forward
to
the
next
coach
he
added
addressing
miller
this
time
i
have
paid
my
fare
on
the
where
the
law
does
not
apply
remonstrated
miller
i
ca
help
that
you
can
doubtless
get
your
money
back
from
the
company
but
this
is
a
day
coach
and
is
distinctly
marked
as
you
must
have
seen
before
you
sat
down
here
the
sign
is
put
there
for
that
purpose
he
indicated
a
large
card
neatly
framed
and
hung
at
the
end
of
the
car
containing
the
legend
white
in
letters
about
a
foot
long
painted
in
white
upon
a
dark
background
typical
one
might
suppose
of
the
distinction
thereby
indicated
you
shall
not
stir
a
step
miller
exclaimed
burns
wrathfully
this
is
an
outrage
upon
a
citizen
of
a
free
country
you
shall
stay
right
here
i
sorry
to
discommode
you
returned
the
conductor
but
there
no
use
kicking
it
the
law
of
virginia
and
i
am
bound
by
it
as
well
as
you
i
have
already
come
near
losing
my
place
because
of
not
enforcing
it
and
i
can
take
no
more
such
chances
since
i
have
a
family
to
support
and
my
friend
has
his
rights
to
maintain
returned
burns
with
determination
there
is
a
vital
principle
at
stake
in
the
matter
really
sir
argued
the
conductor
who
was
a
man
of
peace
and
not
fond
of
controversy
there
no
use
talking
he
absolutely
can
not
ride
in
this
car
how
can
you
prevent
it
asked
burns
lapsing
into
the
argumentative
stage
the
law
gives
me
the
right
to
remove
him
by
force
i
can
call
on
the
train
crew
to
assist
me
or
on
the
other
passengers
if
i
should
choose
to
put
him
off
the
train
entirely
in
the
middle
of
a
swamp
he
would
have
no
redress
the
law
so
provides
if
i
did
not
wish
to
use
force
i
could
simply
switch
this
car
off
at
the
next
siding
transfer
the
white
passengers
to
another
and
leave
you
and
your
friend
in
possession
until
you
were
arrested
and
fined
or
imprisoned
what
he
says
is
absolutely
true
doctor
interposed
miller
at
this
point
it
is
the
law
and
we
are
powerless
to
resist
it
if
we
made
any
trouble
it
would
merely
delay
your
journey
and
imperil
a
life
at
the
other
end
i
go
into
the
other
car
you
shall
not
go
alone
said
burns
stoutly
rising
in
his
turn
a
place
that
is
too
good
for
you
is
not
good
enough
for
me
i
will
sit
wherever
you
do
i
sorry
again
said
the
conductor
who
had
quite
recovered
his
equanimity
and
calmly
conscious
of
his
power
could
scarcely
restrain
an
amused
smile
i
dislike
to
interfere
but
white
passengers
are
not
permitted
to
ride
in
the
colored
car
this
is
an
outrage
declared
burns
a
d
d
outrage
you
are
curtailing
the
rights
not
only
of
colored
people
but
of
white
men
as
well
i
shall
sit
where
i
please
i
warn
you
sir
rejoined
the
conductor
hardening
again
that
the
law
will
be
enforced
the
beauty
of
the
system
lies
in
its
strict
impartiality
it
applies
to
both
races
alike
and
is
equally
infamous
in
both
cases
declared
burns
i
shall
immediately
take
steps
never
mind
doctor
interrupted
miller
soothingly
it
only
for
a
little
while
i
reach
my
destination
just
as
surely
in
the
other
car
and
we
ca
help
it
anyway
i
see
you
again
at
wellington
burns
finding
resistance
futile
at
length
acquiesced
and
made
way
for
miller
to
pass
him
the
colored
doctor
took
up
his
valise
and
crossed
the
platform
to
the
car
ahead
it
was
an
old
car
with
faded
upholstery
from
which
the
stuffing
projected
here
and
there
through
torn
places
apparently
the
floor
had
not
been
swept
for
several
days
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
the
window
sills
and
the
from
which
he
essayed
to
get
a
drink
was
filled
with
stale
water
which
had
made
no
recent
acquaintance
with
ice
there
was
no
other
passenger
in
the
car
and
miller
occupied
himself
in
making
a
rough
calculation
of
what
it
would
cost
the
southern
railroads
to
haul
a
whole
car
for
every
colored
passenger
it
was
expensive
to
say
the
least
it
would
be
cheaper
and
quite
as
considerate
of
their
feelings
to
make
the
negroes
walk
the
car
was
conspicuously
labeled
at
either
end
with
large
cards
similar
to
those
in
the
other
car
except
that
they
bore
the
word
colored
in
black
letters
upon
a
white
background
the
author
of
this
piece
of
legislation
had
contrived
with
an
ingenuity
worthy
of
a
better
cause
that
not
merely
should
the
passengers
be
separated
by
the
color
line
but
that
the
reason
for
this
division
should
be
kept
constantly
in
mind
lest
a
white
man
should
forget
that
he
was
white
not
a
very
likely
contingency
these
cards
would
keep
him
constantly
admonished
of
the
fact
should
a
colored
person
endeavor
for
a
moment
to
lose
sight
of
his
disability
these
staring
signs
would
remind
him
continually
that
between
him
and
the
rest
of
mankind
not
of
his
own
color
there
was
by
law
a
great
gulf
fixed
having
composed
himself
miller
had
opened
a
newspaper
and
was
deep
in
an
editorial
which
set
forth
in
glowing
language
the
inestimable
advantages
which
would
follow
to
certain
recently
acquired
islands
by
the
introduction
of
american
liberty
when
the
rear
door
of
the
car
opened
to
give
entrance
to
captain
george
mcbane
who
took
a
seat
near
the
door
and
lit
a
cigar
miller
knew
him
quite
well
by
sight
and
by
reputation
and
detested
him
as
heartily
he
represented
the
aggressive
offensive
element
among
the
white
people
of
the
new
south
who
made
it
hard
for
a
negro
to
maintain
his
or
to
enjoy
even
the
rights
conceded
to
colored
men
by
southern
laws
mcbane
had
undoubtedly
identified
him
to
the
conductor
in
the
other
car
miller
had
no
desire
to
thrust
himself
upon
the
society
of
white
people
which
indeed
to
one
who
had
traveled
so
much
and
so
far
was
no
novelty
but
he
very
naturally
resented
being
at
this
late
day
the
law
had
been
in
operation
only
a
few
months
branded
and
tagged
and
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
mankind
upon
the
public
highways
like
an
unclean
thing
nevertheless
he
preferred
even
this
to
the
exclusive
society
of
captain
george
mcbane
porter
he
demanded
of
the
colored
train
attaché
who
passed
through
the
car
a
moment
later
is
this
a
smoking
car
for
white
men
no
suh
replied
the
porter
but
they
comes
in
here
sometimes
when
they
ain
no
cullud
ladies
on
the
kyar
well
i
have
paid
fare
and
i
object
to
that
man
smoking
in
here
you
tell
him
to
go
out
i
tell
the
conductor
suh
returned
the
porter
in
a
low
tone
i
jus
as
soon
talk
ter
the
devil
as
ter
that
man
the
white
man
had
spread
himself
over
two
seats
and
was
smoking
vigorously
from
time
to
time
spitting
carelessly
in
the
aisle
when
the
conductor
entered
the
compartment
captain
said
miller
this
car
is
plainly
marked
i
have
paid
fare
and
i
object
to
riding
in
a
smoking
car
all
right
returned
the
conductor
frowning
irritably
i
speak
to
him
he
walked
over
to
the
white
passenger
with
whom
he
was
evidently
acquainted
since
he
addressed
him
by
name
captain
mcbane
he
said
it
against
the
law
for
you
to
ride
in
the
nigger
car
who
are
you
talkin
to
returned
the
other
i
ride
where
i
damn
please
yes
sir
but
the
colored
passenger
objects
i
afraid
i
have
to
ask
you
to
go
into
the
the
hell
you
say
rejoined
mcbane
i
leave
this
car
when
i
get
good
and
ready
and
that
wo
be
till
i
finished
this
cigar
see
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
the
conductor
escaped
from
the
car
before
miller
had
time
for
further
expostulation
finally
mcbane
having
thrown
the
stump
of
his
cigar
into
the
aisle
and
added
to
the
floor
a
finishing
touch
in
the
way
of
expectoration
rose
and
went
back
into
the
white
car
left
alone
in
his
questionable
glory
miller
buried
himself
again
in
his
newspaper
from
which
he
did
not
look
up
until
the
engine
stopped
at
a
tank
station
to
take
water
as
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
a
huge
negro
covered
thickly
with
dust
crawled
off
one
of
the
rear
trucks
unobserved
and
ran
round
the
rear
end
of
the
car
to
a
by
a
neighboring
well
moved
either
by
extreme
thirst
or
by
the
fear
that
his
time
might
be
too
short
to
permit
him
to
draw
a
bucket
of
water
he
threw
himself
down
by
the
trough
drank
long
and
deep
and
plunging
his
head
into
the
water
shook
himself
like
a
wet
dog
and
crept
furtively
back
to
his
dangerous
perch
miller
who
had
seen
this
man
from
the
car
window
had
noticed
a
very
singular
thing
as
the
dusty
tramp
passed
the
rear
coach
he
cast
toward
it
a
glance
of
intense
ferocity
up
to
that
moment
the
man
face
which
miller
had
recognized
under
its
grimy
coating
had
been
that
of
an
ordinarily
somewhat
reckless
negro
at
present
rather
the
worse
for
wear
the
change
that
now
came
over
it
suggested
a
concentrated
hatred
almost
uncanny
in
its
murderousness
with
awakened
curiosity
miller
followed
the
direction
of
the
glance
and
saw
that
it
rested
upon
a
window
where
captain
mcbane
sat
looking
out
when
miller
looked
back
the
negro
had
disappeared
at
the
next
station
a
chinaman
of
the
ordinary
laundry
type
boarded
the
train
and
took
his
seat
in
the
white
car
without
objection
at
another
point
a
colored
nurse
found
a
place
with
her
mistress
white
people
said
miller
to
himself
who
had
seen
these
passengers
from
the
window
do
not
object
to
the
negro
as
a
servant
as
the
traditional
negro
the
servant
he
is
welcomed
as
an
equal
he
is
repudiated
miller
was
something
of
a
philosopher
he
had
long
ago
had
the
conclusion
forced
upon
him
that
an
educated
man
of
his
race
in
order
to
live
comfortably
in
the
united
states
must
be
either
a
philosopher
or
a
fool
and
since
he
wished
to
be
happy
and
was
not
exactly
a
fool
he
had
cultivated
philosophy
by
and
by
he
saw
a
white
man
with
a
dog
enter
the
rear
coach
miller
wondered
whether
the
dog
would
be
allowed
to
ride
with
his
master
and
if
not
what
disposition
would
be
made
of
him
he
was
a
handsome
dog
and
miller
who
was
fond
of
animals
would
not
have
objected
to
the
company
of
a
dog
as
a
dog
he
was
nevertheless
conscious
of
a
queer
sensation
when
he
saw
the
porter
take
the
dog
by
the
collar
and
start
in
his
own
direction
and
felt
consciously
relieved
when
the
canine
passenger
was
taken
on
past
him
into
the
ahead
miller
hand
was
hanging
over
the
arm
of
his
seat
and
the
dog
an
intelligent
shepherd
licked
it
as
he
passed
miller
was
not
entirely
sure
that
he
would
not
have
liked
the
porter
to
leave
the
dog
there
he
was
a
friendly
dog
and
seemed
inclined
to
be
sociable
toward
evening
the
train
drew
up
at
a
station
where
quite
a
party
of
farm
laborers
fresh
from
their
daily
toil
swarmed
out
from
the
conspicuously
labeled
colored
and
into
the
car
with
miller
they
were
a
jolly
crowd
and
free
from
the
embarrassing
presence
of
white
people
proceeded
to
enjoy
themselves
after
their
own
fashion
here
an
amorous
fellow
sat
with
his
arm
around
a
buxom
girl
waist
a
musically
inclined
individual
his
talents
did
not
go
far
beyond
inclination
produced
a
and
struck
up
a
tune
to
which
a
boy
danced
in
the
aisle
they
were
noisy
loquacious
happy
dirty
and
malodorous
for
a
while
miller
was
amused
and
pleased
they
were
his
people
and
he
felt
a
certain
expansive
warmth
toward
them
in
spite
of
their
obvious
shortcomings
by
and
by
however
the
air
became
too
close
and
he
went
out
upon
the
platform
for
the
sake
of
the
democratic
ideal
which
meant
so
much
to
his
race
he
might
have
endured
the
affliction
he
could
easily
imagine
that
people
of
refinement
with
the
power
in
their
hands
might
be
tempted
to
strain
the
democratic
ideal
in
order
to
avoid
such
contact
but
personally
and
apart
from
the
mere
matter
of
racial
sympathy
these
people
were
just
as
offensive
to
him
as
to
the
whites
in
the
other
end
of
the
train
surely
if
a
classification
of
passengers
on
trains
was
at
all
desirable
it
might
be
made
upon
some
more
logical
and
considerate
basis
than
a
mere
arbitrary
tactless
and
by
the
very
nature
of
things
brutal
drawing
of
a
color
line
it
was
a
veritable
bed
of
procrustes
this
standard
which
the
whites
had
set
for
the
negroes
those
who
grew
above
it
must
have
their
heads
cut
off
figuratively
speaking
must
be
forced
back
to
the
level
assigned
to
their
race
those
who
fell
beneath
the
standard
set
had
their
necks
stretched
literally
enough
as
the
ghastly
record
in
the
daily
papers
gave
conclusive
evidence
miller
breathed
more
freely
when
the
lively
crowd
got
off
at
the
next
station
after
a
short
ride
moreover
he
had
a
light
heart
a
conscience
void
of
offense
and
was
only
thirty
years
old
his
philosophy
had
become
somewhat
jaded
on
this
journey
but
he
pulled
it
together
for
a
final
effort
was
it
not
after
all
a
wise
provision
of
nature
that
had
given
to
a
race
destined
to
a
long
servitude
and
a
slow
emergence
therefrom
a
cheerfulness
of
spirit
which
enabled
them
to
catch
pleasure
on
the
wing
and
endure
with
equanimity
the
ills
that
seemed
inevitable
the
ability
to
live
and
thrive
under
adverse
circumstances
is
the
surest
guaranty
of
the
future
the
race
which
at
the
last
shall
inherit
the
earth
the
residuary
legatee
of
civilization
will
be
the
race
which
remains
longest
upon
it
the
negro
was
here
before
the
was
evolved
and
his
thick
lips
and
eyes
looked
out
from
the
inscrutable
face
of
the
sphinx
across
the
sands
of
egypt
while
yet
the
ancestors
of
those
who
now
oppress
him
were
living
in
caves
practicing
human
sacrifice
and
painting
themselves
with
woad
and
the
negro
is
here
yet
are
the
meek
quoted
miller
at
the
end
of
these
consoling
reflections
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
if
this
be
true
the
negro
may
yet
come
into
his
estate
for
meekness
seems
to
be
set
apart
as
his
portion
the
journey
came
to
an
end
just
as
the
sun
had
sunk
into
the
west
simultaneously
with
miller
exit
from
the
train
a
great
black
figure
crawled
off
the
trucks
of
the
rear
car
on
the
side
opposite
the
station
platform
stretching
and
shaking
himself
with
a
free
gesture
the
black
man
seeing
himself
unobserved
moved
somewhat
stiffly
round
the
end
of
the
car
to
the
station
platform
de

muttered

as
the

drew
up
at
the
station
platform
price
came
forward
from
the
white
and
stood
expectantly
by
the
door
of
the
white
coach
miller
having
left
his
car
came
down
the
platform
in
time
to
intercept
burns
as
he
left
the
train
and
to
introduce
him
to
price
my
carriage
is
in
waiting
said
price
i
should
have
liked
to
have

my
own
house
but
my
wife

it
more
convenient

very
kind

miller

said
miller
i
am
expected
at

my
wife
and

are
waiting
for
me
in
the
buggy
yonder
by
the
platform
oh

well
of
course

must
go
but
do
forget
our
appointment
let
see
price
i
can
eat
and
get

in
half
an
hour
that
will
make
it
i
have
asked
several
of
the
local
physicians
to
be
present
at
eight
said
price
the
case
can
safely
wait
until
then
very
well
miller
be
on
hand
at
eight
i
shall
expect
you
without
fail
where
shall
he
come
dr
price
to
the
residence
of
major
philip
carteret
on
vine
street
i
have
invited
miller
to
be
present
and
assist
in
the
operation
burns
continued
as
they
drove
toward
the
hotel
he
was
a
favorite
pupil
of
mine
and
is
a
credit
to
the
profession
i
presume
you
saw
his
article
in
the
medical
gazette
yes
and
i
assisted
him
in
the
case
returned
price
it
was
a
colored
lad
one
of
his
patients
and
he
called
me
in
to
help
him
he
is
a
capable
man
and
very
much
liked
by
the
white
physicians
miller
wife
and
child
were
waiting
for
him
in
fluttering
anticipation
he
kissed
them
both
as
he
climbed
into
the
buggy
we
came
at
four
said
miller
a
handsome
young
woman
who
might
be
anywhere
between
and
thirty
and
whose
complexion
in
the
twilight
was
not
distinguishable
from
that
of
a
white
person
but
the
train
was
late
two
hours
they
said
we
came
back
at
six
and
have
been
waiting
ever
since
yes
papa
piped
the
child
a
little
boy
of
six
or
seven
who
sat
between
them
and
i
am
very
hungry
miller
felt
very
much
elated
as
he
drove
homeward
through
the
twilight
by
his
side
sat
the
two
persons
whom
he
loved
best
in
all
the
world
his
affairs
were
prosperous
upon
opening
his
office
in
the
city
he
had
been
received
by
the
members
of
his
own
profession
with
a
cordiality
generally
frank
and
in
no
case
much
reserved
the
colored
population
of
the
city
was
large
but
in
the
main
poor
and
the
white
physicians
were
not
unwilling
to
share
this
unprofitable
practice
with
a
colored
doctor
worthy
of
confidence
in
the
intervals
of
the
work
upon
his
hospital
he
had
built
up
a
considerable
practice
among
his
own
people
but
except
in
the
case
of
some
poor
unfortunate
whose
pride
had
been
lost
in
poverty
or
sin
no
white
patient
had
ever
called
upon
him
for
treatment
he
knew
very
well
the
measure
of
his
powers
a
liberal
education
had
given
him
opportunity
to
compare
himself
with
other
men
and
was
secretly
conscious
that
in
point
of
skill
and
knowledge
he
did
not
suffer
by
comparison
with
any
other
physician
in
the
town
he
liked
to
believe
that
the
race
antagonism
which
hampered
his
progress
and
that
of
his
people
was
a
mere
temporary
thing
the
outcome
of
former
conditions
and
bound
to
disappear
in
time
and
that
when
a
colored
man
should
demonstrate
to
the
community
in
which
he
lived
that
he
possessed
character
and
power
that
community
would
find
a
way
in
which
to
enlist
his
services
for
the
public
good
he
had
already
made
himself
useful
and
had
received
many
kind
words
and
other
marks
of
appreciation
he
was
now
offered
a
further
confirmation
of
his
theory
having
recognized
his
skill
the
white
people
were
now
ready
to
take
advantage
of
it
any
lurking
doubt
he
may
have
felt
when
first
invited
by
burns
to
participate
in
the
operation
had
been
dispelled
by
price
prompt
acquiescence
on
the
way
homeward
miller
told
his
wife
of
this
appointment
she
was
greatly
interested
she
was
herself
a
mother
with
an
only
child
moreover
there
was
a
stronger
impulse
than
mere
humanity
to
draw
her
toward
the
stricken
mother
janet
had
a
tender
heart
and
could
have
loved
this
white
sister
her
sole
living
relative
of
whom
she
knew
all
her
life
long
she
had
yearned
for
a
kind
word
a
nod
a
smile
the
least
thing
that
imagination
might
have
twisted
into
a
recognition
of
the
tie
between
them
but
it
had
never
come
and
yet
janet
was
not
angry
she
was
of
a
forgiving
temper
she
could
never
bear
malice
she
was
educated
had
read
many
books
and
appreciated
to
the
full
the
social
forces
arrayed
against
any
such
recognition
as
she
had
dreamed
of
of
the
two
barriers
between
them
a
man
might
have
forgiven
the
one
a
woman
would
not
be
likely
to
overlook
either
the
bar
sinister
or
the
difference
of
race
even
to
the
slight
extent
of
a
silent
recognition
blood
is
thicker
than
water
but
if
it
flow
too
far
from
conventional
channels
may
turn
to
gall
and
wormwood
nevertheless
when
the
heart
speaks
reason
falls
into
the
background
and
janet
would
have
worshiped
this
sister
even
afar
off
had
she
received
even
the
slightest
encouragement
so
strong
was
this
weakness
that
she
had
been
angry
with
herself
for
her
lack
of
pride
or
even
of
a
decent
it
was
she
sometimes
thought
the
heritage
of
her
mother
race
and
she
was
ashamed
of
it
as
part
of
the
taint
of
slavery
she
had
never
acknowledged
even
to
her
husband
from
whom
she
concealed
nothing
else
her
secret
thoughts
upon
this
lifelong
sorrow
this
silent
grief
was
nature
penalty
or
society
revenge
for
whatever
heritage
of
beauty
or
intellect
or
personal
charm
had
come
to
her
with
her
father
blood
for
she
had
received
no
other
inheritance
her
sister
was
rich
by
right
of
her
birth
if
janet
had
been
fortunate
her
good
fortune
had
not
been
due
to
any
provision
made
for
her
by
her
white
father
she
knew
quite
well
how
passionately
for
many
years
her
proud
sister
had
longed
and
prayed
in
vain
for
the
child
which
had
at
length
brought
joy
into
her
household
and
she
could
feel
by
sympathy
all
the
sickening
suspense
with
which
the
child
parents
must
await
the
result
of
this
dangerous
operation
o
will
she
adjured
her
husband
anxiously
when
he
had
told
her
of
the
engagement
you
must
be
very
careful
think
of
the
child
poor
mother
think
of
our
own
dear
child
and
what
it
would
mean
to
lose
him
vii
the
operation
price
was
not
entirely
at
ease
in
his
mind
as
the
two
doctors
drove
rapidly
from
the
hotel
to
major
carteret
himself
a
liberal
man
from
his
point
of
view
he
saw
no
reason
why
a
colored
doctor
might
not
operate
upon
a
white
male
child
there
are
fine
distinctions
in
the
application
of
the
color
line
but
several
other
physicians
had
been
invited
some
of
whom
were
men
of
notions
who
might
not
relish
such
an
innovation
this
however
was
but
a
small
difficulty
compared
with
what
might
be
feared
from
major
carteret
himself
for
he
knew
carteret
unrelenting
hostility
to
anything
that
savored
of
recognition
of
the
negro
as
the
equal
of
white
men
it
was
traditional
in
wellington
that
no
colored
person
had
ever
entered
the
front
door
of
the
carteret
residence
and
that
the
luckless
individual
who
once
presented
himself
there
upon
alleged
business
and
resented
being
ordered
to
the
back
door
had
been
unceremoniously
thrown
over
the
piazza
railing
into
a
rather
thorny
clump
of
rosebushes
below
if
miller
were
going
as
a
servant
to
hold
a
basin
or
a
sponge
there
would
be
no
difficulty
but
as
a
surgeon
well
he
would
borrow
trouble
under
the
circumstances
the
major
might
yield
a
point
but
as
they
neared
the
house
the
major
unyielding
disposition
loomed
up
formidably
perhaps
if
the
matter
were
properly
presented
to
burns
he
might
consent
to
withdraw
the
invitation
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
send
miller
a
note
by
the
way
burns
he
said
i
very
friendly
to
miller
and
should
personally
like
to
have
him
with
us
but
i
ought
to
have
told
you
this
before
but
i
could
very
well
do
so
on
such
short
notice
in
miller
presence
we
are
a
conservative
people
and
our
local
customs
are
not
very
flexible
we
jog
along
in
much
the
same
old
way
our
fathers
did
i
not
at
all
sure
that
major
carteret
or
the
other
gentlemen
would
consent
to
the
presence
of
a
negro
doctor
i
think
you
misjudge
your
own
people
returned
burns
they
are
broader
than
you
think
we
have
our
prejudices
against
the
negro
at
the
north
but
we
do
not
let
them
stand
in
the
way
of
anything
that
want
at
any
rate
it
is
too
late
now
and
i
will
accept
the
responsibility
if
the
question
is
raised
i
will
attend
to
it
when
i
am
performing
an
operation
i
must
be
caesar
aut
price
was
not
reassured
but
he
had
done
his
duty
and
felt
the
reward
of
virtue
if
there
should
be
trouble
he
would
not
be
responsible
moreover
there
was
a
large
fee
at
stake
and
burns
was
not
likely
to
prove
too
obdurate
they
were
soon
at
carteret
where
they
found
assembled
the
several
physicians
invited
by
price
these
were
successively
introduced
as
drs
dudley
hooper
and
ashe
all
of
whom
were
gentlemen
of
good
standing
socially
and
in
their
profession
and
considered
it
a
high
privilege
to
witness
so
delicate
an
operation
at
the
hands
of
so
eminent
a
member
of
their
profession
major
carteret
entered
the
room
and
was
duly
presented
to
the
famous
specialist
carteret
anxious
look
lightened
somewhat
at
sight
of
the
array
of
talent
present
it
suggested
of
course
the
gravity
of
the
impending
event
but
gave
assurance
of
all
the
skill
and
care
which
science
could
afford
burns
was
shown
to
the
nursery
from
which
he
returned
in
five
minutes
the
case
is
ready
he
announced
are
the
gentlemen
all
present
i
believe
so
answered
price
quickly
miller
had
not
yet
arrived
perhaps
thought
price
a
happy
accident
or
some
imperative
call
had
detained
him
this
would
be
fortunate
indeed
burns
square
jaw
had
a
very
determined
look
it
would
be
a
pity
if
any
acrimonious
discussion
should
arise
on
the
eve
of
a
delicate
operation
if
the
clock
on
the
mantel
would
only
move
faster
the
question
might
never
come
up
i
do
see
miller
observed
burns
looking
around
the
room
i
asked
him
to
come
at
eight
there
are
ten
minutes
yet
major
carteret
looked
up
with
a
sudden
frown
may
i
ask
to
whom
you
refer
he
inquired
in
an
ominous
tone
the
other
gentlemen
showed
signs
of
interest
not
to
say
emotion
price
smiled
quizzically
miller
of
your
city
he
was
one
of
my
favorite
pupils
he
is
also
a
graduate
of
the
vienna
hospitals
and
a
surgeon
of
unusual
skill
i
have
asked
him
to
assist
in
the
operation
every
eye
was
turned
toward
carteret
whose
crimsoned
face
had
set
in
a
look
of
grim
determination
the
person
to
whom
you
refer
is
a
negro
i
believe
he
said
he
is
a
colored
man
certainly
returned
burns
though
one
would
never
think
of
his
color
after
knowing
him
well
i
do
not
know
sir
returned
carteret
with
an
effort
at
what
the
customs
of
philadelphia
or
vienna
may
be
but
in
the
south
we
do
not
call
negro
doctors
to
attend
white
patients
i
could
not
permit
a
negro
to
enter
my
house
upon
such
an
errand
i
am
here
sir
replied
burns
with
spirit
to
perform
a
certain
operation
since
i
assume
the
responsibility
the
case
must
be
under
my
entire
control
otherwise
i
can
not
operate
gentlemen
interposed
price
smoothly
i
beg
of
you
both
this
is
a
matter
for
calm
discussion
and
any
asperity
is
to
be
deplored
the
life
at
stake
here
should
not
be
imperiled
by
any
consideration
of
minor
importance
your
humanity
does
you
credit
sir
retorted
burns
but
other
matters
too
are
important
i
have
invited
this
gentleman
here
my
professional
honor
is
involved
and
i
merely
invoke
my
rights
to
maintain
it
it
is
a
matter
of
principle
which
ought
not
to
give
way
to
a
mere
prejudice
that
also
states
the
case
for
major
carteret
rejoined
price
suavely
he
has
certain
principles
call
them
prejudices
if
you
like
certain
inflexible
rules
of
conduct
by
which
he
regulates
his
life
one
of
these
which
he
shares
with
us
all
in
some
degree
forbids
the
recognition
of
the
negro
as
a
social
equal
i
do
not
know
what
miller
social
value
may
be
replied
burns
stoutly
or
whether
you
gain
or
lose
by
your
attitude
toward
him
i
have
invited
him
here
in
a
strictly
professional
capacity
with
which
his
color
is
not
at
all
concerned
burns
does
not
quite
appreciate
major
carteret
point
of
view
said
price
this
is
not
with
him
an
unimportant
matter
or
a
mere
question
of
prejudice
or
even
of
personal
taste
it
is
a
sacred
principle
lying
at
the
very
root
of
our
social
order
involving
the
purity
and
prestige
of
our
race
you
northern
gentlemen
do
not
quite
appreciate
our
situation
if
you
lived
here
a
year
or
two
you
would
act
as
we
do
of
course
he
added
diplomatically
if
there
were
no
alternative
if
burns
were
willing
to
put
miller
presence
on
the
ground
of
imperative
necessity
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
sir
retorted
burns
with
some
heat
i
have
not
come
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
to
undertake
an
operation
which
i
can
not
perform
without
the
aid
of
some
particular
physician
i
merely
stand
upon
my
professional
rights
carteret
was
deeply
agitated
the
operation
must
not
be
deferred
his
child
life
might
be
endangered
by
delay
if
the
negro
presence
were
indispensable
he
would
even
submit
to
it
though
in
order
to
avoid
so
painful
a
necessity
he
would
rather
humble
himself
to
the
northern
doctor
the
latter
course
involved
merely
a
personal
sacrifice
the
former
a
vital
principle
perhaps
there
was
another
way
of
escape
miller
presence
could
not
but
be
distasteful
to
carteret
for
other
reasons
miller
wife
was
the
living
evidence
of
a
painful
episode
in
carteret
family
which
the
doctor
presence
would
inevitably
recall
once
before
carteret
life
had
been
endangered
by
encountering
at
a
time
of
great
nervous
strain
this
sister
and
her
child
she
was
even
now
upon
the
verge
of
collapse
at
the
prospect
of
her
child
suffering
and
should
be
protected
from
the
intrusion
of
any
idea
which
might
add
to
her
distress
burns
he
said
with
the
suave
courtesy
which
was
part
of
his
inheritance
i
beg
your
pardon
for
my
heat
and
throw
myself
upon
your
magnanimity
as
between
white
men
i
am
a
gentleman
sir
before
i
am
a
white
man
interposed
burns
slightly
mollified
however
by
carteret
change
of
manner
the
terms
should
be
synonymous
carteret
could
not
refrain
from
saying
as
between
white
men
and
gentlemen
i
say
to
you
frankly
that
there
are
vital
personal
reasons
apart
from
miller
color
why
his
presence
in
this
house
would
be
distasteful
with
this
statement
sir
i
throw
myself
upon
your
mercy
my
child
life
is
worth
more
to
me
than
any
earthly
thing
and
i
must
be
governed
by
your
decision
burns
was
plainly
wavering
the
clock
moved
with
provoking
slowness
miller
would
be
there
in
five
minutes
may
i
speak
with
you
privately
a
moment
doctor
asked
price
they
withdrew
from
the
room
and
were
engaged
in
conversation
for
a
few
moments
burns
finally
yielded
i
shall
nevertheless
feel
humiliated
when
i
meet
miller
again
he
said
but
of
course
if
there
is
a
personal
question
involved
that
alters
the
situation
had
it
been
merely
a
matter
of
color
i
should
have
maintained
my
position
as
things
stand
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
so
far
as
miller
is
concerned
like
pontius
pilate
yes
indeed
sir
i
feel
very
much
like
that
individual
i
explain
the
matter
to
miller
returned
price
amiably
and
make
it
all
right
with
him
we
southern
people
understand
the
negroes
better
than
you
do
sir
why
should
we
not
they
have
been
constantly
under
our
interested
observation
for
several
hundred
years
you
feel
this
vastly
more
than
miller
will
he
knows
the
feeling
of
the
white
people
and
is
accustomed
to
it
he
wishes
to
live
and
do
business
here
and
is
quite
too
shrewd
to
antagonize
his
neighbors
or
come
where
he
is
not
wanted
he
is
in
fact
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
do
so
i
shall
leave
the
explanation
to
you
entirely
rejoined
burns
as
they
reëntered
the
other
room
carteret
led
the
way
to
the
nursery
where
the
operation
was
to
take
place
price
lingered
for
a
moment
miller
was
not
likely
to
be
behind
the
hour
if
he
came
at
all
and
it
would
be
well
to
head
him
off
before
the
operation
began
scarcely
had
the
rest
left
the
room
when
the
doorbell
sounded
and
a
servant
announced
miller
price
stepped
into
the
hall
and
met
miller
face
to
face
he
had
meant
to
state
the
situation
to
miller
frankly
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
he
wavered
he
was
a
fine
physician
but
he
shrank
from
strenuous
responsibilities
it
had
been
easy
to
theorize
about
the
negro
it
was
more
difficult
to
look
this
man
in
the
eyes
whom
at
this
moment
he
felt
to
be
as
essentially
a
gentleman
as
himself
and
tell
him
the
humiliating
truth
as
a
physician
his
method
was
to
ease
pain
he
would
rather
take
the
risk
of
losing
a
patient
from
the
use
of
an
anaesthetic
than
from
the
shock
of
an
operation
he
liked
miller
wished
him
well
and
would
not
wittingly
wound
his
feelings
he
really
thought
him
too
much
of
a
gentleman
for
the
town
in
view
of
the
restrictions
with
which
he
must
inevitably
be
hampered
there
was
something
melancholy
to
a
cultivated
mind
about
a
sensitive
educated
man
who
happened
to
be
off
color
such
a
person
was
a
sort
of
social
misfit
an
odd
quantity
educated
out
of
his
own
class
with
no
possible
hope
of
entrance
into
that
above
it
he
felt
quite
sure
that
if
he
had
been
in
miller
place
he
would
never
have
settled
in
the
south
he
would
have
moved
to
europe
or
to
the
west
indies
or
some
central
or
south
american
state
where
questions
of
color
were
not
regarded
as
vitally
important
price
did
not
like
to
lie
even
to
a
negro
to
a
man
of
his
own
caste
his
word
was
his
bond
if
it
were
painful
to
lie
it
would
be
humiliating
to
be
found
out
the
principle
of
was
also
involved
in
the
matter
his
claim
of
superiority
to
the
colored
doctor
rested
fundamentally
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
white
and
miller
was
not
and
yet
this
superiority
for
which
he
could
claim
no
credit
since
he
had
not
made
himself
was
the
very
breath
of
his
nostrils
he
would
not
have
changed
places
with
the
other
for
wealth
untold
and
as
a
gentleman
he
would
not
care
to
have
another
gentleman
even
a
colored
man
catch
him
in
a
lie
of
this
however
there
was
scarcely
any
danger
a
word
to
the
other
surgeons
would
insure
their
corroboration
of
whatever
he
might
tell
miller
no
one
of
them
would
willingly
wound
miller
or
embarrass
price
indeed
they
need
not
know
that
miller
had
come
in
time
for
the
operation
i
sorry
miller
he
said
with
apparent
regret
but
we
were
here
ahead
of
time
and
the
case
took
a
turn
which
would
admit
of
no
delay
so
the
gentlemen
went
in
burns
is
with
the
patient
now
and
asked
me
to
explain
why
we
did
not
wait
for
you
i
sorry
too
returned
miller
regretfully
but
nothing
doubting
he
was
well
aware
that
in
such
cases
danger
might
attend
upon
delay
he
had
lost
his
chance
through
no
fault
of
his
own
or
of
any
one
else
i
hope
that
all
is
well
he
said
hesitatingly
not
sure
whether
he
would
be
asked
to
remain
all
is
well
so
far
step
round
to
my
office
in
the
morning
miller
or
come
in
when
you
passing
and
i
tell
you
the
details
this
was
tantamount
to
a
dismissal
so
miller
took
his
leave
descending
the
doorsteps
he
stood
for
a
moment
undecided
whether
to
return
home
or
to
go
to
the
hotel
and
await
the
return
of
burns
when
he
heard
his
name
called
from
the
house
in
a
low
tone
oh
doctuh
he
stepped
back
toward
the
door
outside
of
which
stood
the
colored
servant
who
had
just
let
him
out
dat
all
a
lie
doctuh
he
whispered
de
operation
already
had
jes
gone
in

befo

he
in

an
dey
had

hot
an
heavy
nip
an

till

up
an
say

he
objected
to
an
wid
dat
de
doctuh
give
in
a
fine
man
suh
but
dey
wuz
too
much
fer
thank
you
sam
i
much
obliged
returned
miller
mechanically
one
likes
to
know
the
truth
truth
it
has
been
said
is
mighty
and
must
prevail
but
it
sometimes
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
the
mouth
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
miller
would
not
have
anticipated
such
an
invitation
and
for
that
reason
had
appreciated
it
all
the
more
the
rebuff
came
with
a
corresponding
shock
he
had
the
heart
of
a
man
the
sensibilities
of
a
cultivated
gentleman
the
one
was
sore
the
other
deeply
wounded
he
was
not
altogether
sure
upon
reflection
whether
he
blamed
price
very
much
for
the
amiable
lie
which
had
been
meant
to
spare
his
feelings
or
thanked
sam
a
great
deal
for
the
unpalatable
truth
janet
met
him
at
the
door
how
is
the
baby
she
asked
excitedly
price
says
he
is
doing
well
what
is
the
matter
will
and
why
are
you
back
so
soon
he
would
have
spared
her
the
story
but
she
was
a
woman
and
would
have
it
he
was
wounded
too
and
wanted
sympathy
of
which
janet
was
an
exhaustless
fountain
so
he
told
her
what
had
happened
she
comforted
him
after
the
manner
of
a
loving
woman
and
felt
righteously
indignant
toward
her
sister
husband
who
had
thus
been
instrumental
in
the
humiliation
of
her
own
her
anger
did
not
embrace
her
sister
and
yet
she
felt
obscurely
that
their
unacknowledged
relationship
had
been
the
malignant
force
which
had
given
her
husband
pain
and
defeated
his
honorable
ambition
when
price
entered
the
nursery
burns
was
leaning
attentively
over
the
operating
table
the
implements
needed
for
the
operation
were
all
in
readiness
the
knives
the
basin
the
sponge
the
materials
for
dressing
the
wound
all
the
ghastly
paraphernalia
of
vivisection
carteret
had
been
banished
to
another
room
where
clara
vainly
attempted
to
soothe
her
old
mammy
jane
still
burdened
by
her
fears
fervently
prayed
the
good
lord
to
spare
the
life
of
the
sweet
little
grandson
of
her
dear
old
mistress
burns
had
placed
his
ear
to
the
child
chest
which
had
been
bared
for
the
incision
price
stood
ready
to
administer
the
anaesthetic
little
dodie
looked
up
with
a
faint
expression
of
wonder
as
if
dimly
conscious
of
some
unusual
event
the
major
shivered
at
the
thought
of
what
the
child
must
undergo
there
a
change
in
his
breathing
said
burns
lifting
his
head
the
whistling
noise
is
less
pronounced
and
he
breathes
easier
the
obstruction
seems
to
have
shifted
applying
his
ear
again
to
the
child
throat
he
listened
for
a
moment
intently
and
then
picking
the
baby
up
from
the
table
gave
it
a
couple
of
sharp
claps
between
the
shoulders
simultaneously
a
small
object
shot
out
from
the
child
mouth
struck
price
in
the
neighborhood
of
his
waistband
and
then
rattled
lightly
against
the
floor
whereupon
the
baby
as
though
conscious
of
his
narrow
escape
smiled
and
gurgled
and
reaching
upward
clutched
the
doctor
whiskers
with
his
little
hand
which
according
to
old
jane
had
a
stronger
grip
than
any
other
infant
in
wellington
viii
the
campaign
drags
the
campaign
for
white
supremacy
was
dragging
carteret
had
set
out
in
the
columns
of
the
morning
chronicle
all
the
reasons
why
this
movement
inaugurated
by
the
three
men
who
had
met
six
months
before
at
the
office
of
the
chronicle
should
be
supported
by
the
white
public
negro
citizenship
was
a
grotesque
farce
sambo
and
dinah
raised
from
the
kitchen
to
the
cabinet
were
a
spectacle
to
make
the
gods
laugh
the
laws
by
which
it
had
been
sought
to
put
the
negroes
on
a
level
with
the
whites
must
be
swept
away
in
theory
as
they
had
failed
in
fact
if
it
were
impossible
without
a
further
education
of
public
opinion
to
secure
the
repeal
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
it
was
at
least
the
solemn
duty
of
the
state
to
endeavor
through
its
own
constitution
to
escape
from
the
domination
of
a
weak
and
incompetent
electorate
and
confine
the
negro
to
that
inferior
condition
for
which
nature
had
evidently
designed
him
in
spite
of
the
force
and
intelligence
with
which
carteret
had
expressed
these
and
similar
views
they
had
not
met
the
immediate
response
anticipated
there
were
thoughtful
men
willing
to
let
well
enough
alone
who
saw
no
necessity
for
such
a
movement
they
believed
that
peace
prosperity
and
popular
education
offered
a
surer
remedy
for
social
ills
than
the
reopening
of
issues
supposed
to
have
been
settled
there
were
timid
men
who
shrank
from
civic
strife
there
were
busy
men
who
had
something
else
to
do
there
were
a
few
fair
men
prepared
to
admit
privately
that
a
class
constituting
half
to
two
thirds
of
the
population
were
fairly
entitled
to
some
representation
in
the
bodies
perhaps
there
might
have
been
found
somewhere
in
the
state
a
single
white
man
ready
to
concede
that
all
men
were
entitled
to
equal
rights
before
the
law
that
there
were
some
white
men
who
had
learned
little
and
forgotten
nothing
goes
without
saying
for
knowledge
and
wisdom
are
not
impartially
distributed
among
even
the
most
favored
race
there
were
ignorant
and
vicious
negroes
and
they
had
a
monopoly
of
neither
ignorance
nor
crime
for
there
were
prosperous
negroes
and
whites
until
carteret
and
his
committee
began
their
baleful
campaign
the
people
of
the
state
were
living
in
peace
and
harmony
the
legislation
in
more
southern
states
with
large
negro
majorities
had
awakened
scarcely
an
echo
in
this
state
with
a
population
two
thirds
white
even
the
triumph
of
the
fusion
party
had
not
been
regarded
as
a
race
issue
it
remained
for
carteret
and
his
friends
to
discover
with
inspiration
from
whatever
supernatural
source
the
discriminating
reader
may
elect
that
the
darker
race
docile
by
instinct
humble
by
training
patiently
waiting
upon
its
as
yet
uncertain
destiny
was
an
incubus
a
corpse
chained
to
the
body
politic
and
that
the
negro
vote
was
a
source
of
danger
to
the
state
no
matter
how
cast
or
by
whom
directed
to
discuss
means
for
counteracting
this
apathy
a
meeting
of
the
big
three
as
they
had
begun
to
designate
themselves
jocularly
was
held
at
the
office
of
the
morning
chronicle
on
the
next
day
but
one
after
little
dodie
fortunate
escape
from
the
knife
it
seems
said
general
belmont
opening
the
discussion
as
though
we
had
undertaken
more
than
we
can
carry
through
it
is
clear
that
we
must
reckon
on
opposition
both
at
home
and
abroad
if
we
are
to
hope
for
success
we
must
extend
the
lines
of
our
campaign
the
north
as
well
as
our
own
people
must
be
convinced
that
we
have
right
upon
our
side
we
are
conscious
of
the
purity
of
our
motives
but
we
should
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
evil
mcbane
was
tapping
the
floor
impatiently
with
his
foot
during
this
harangue
i
do
see
the
use
he
interrupted
of
so
much
beating
about
the
bush
we
may
as
well
be
honest
about
this
thing
we
are
going
to
put
the
niggers
down
because
we
want
to
and
think
we
can
so
why
waste
our
time
in
mere
pretense
i
no
hypocrite
myself
if
i
want
a
thing
i
take
it
provided
i
strong
enough
my
dear
captain
resumed
the
general
with
biting
suavity
your
frankness
does
you
credit
honest
man
the
noblest
work
of
god
but
we
can
not
carry
on
politics
in
these
degenerate
times
without
a
certain
amount
of
diplomacy
in
the
good
old
days
when
your
father
was
alive
and
perhaps
nowadays
in
the
discipline
of
convicts
direct
and
simple
methods
might
be
safely
resorted
to
but
this
is
a
modern
age
and
in
dealing
with
so
fundamental
a
right
as
the
suffrage
we
must
profess
a
decent
regard
for
the
opinions
of
even
that
misguided
portion
of
mankind
which
may
not
agree
with
us
this
is
the
age
of
crowds
and
we
must
have
the
crowd
with
us
the
captain
flushed
at
the
allusion
to
his
father
calling
at
which
he
took
more
offense
than
at
the
mention
of
his
own
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
these
old
aristocrats
while
reaping
the
profits
of
slavery
had
despised
the
instruments
by
which
they
were
attained
the
overseer
only
less
than
the
black
slave
mcbane
was
rich
he
lived
in
wellington
but
he
had
never
been
invited
to
the
home
of
either
general
belmont
or
major
carteret
nor
asked
to
join
the
club
of
which
they
were
members
his
face
therefore
wore
a
distinct
scowl
and
his
single
eye
glowed
ominously
he
would
help
these
fellows
carry
the
state
for
white
supremacy
and
then
he
would
have
his
innings
he
would
have
more
to
say
than
they
dreamed
as
to
who
should
fill
the
offices
under
the
new
deal
men
of
no
better
birth
or
breeding
than
he
had
represented
southern
states
in
congress
since
the
war
why
should
he
not
run
for
governor
representative
whatever
he
chose
he
had
money
enough
to
buy
out
half
a
dozen
of
these
aristocrats
and
money
was
you
see
captain
the
general
went
on
looking
mcbane
smilingly
and
unflinchingly
in
the
eye
we
need
white
immigration
we
need
northern
capital
good
name
is
better
than
great
riches
and
we
must
prove
our
cause
a
righteous
one
we
must
be
armed
at
all
points
added
carteret
and
prepared
for
defense
as
well
as
for
attack
we
must
make
our
campaign
a
national
one
for
instance
resumed
the
general
you
carteret
represent
the
associated
press
through
your
hands
passes
all
the
news
of
the
state
what
more
powerful
medium
for
the
propagation
of
an
idea
the
man
who
would
govern
a
nation
by
writing
its
songs
was
a
blethering
idiot
beside
the
fellow
who
can
edit
its
news
dispatches
the
negroes
are
playing
into
our
hands
every
crime
that
one
of
them
commits
is
reported
by
us
with
the
latitude
they
have
had
in
this
state
they
are
growing
more
impudent
and
every
day
a
yellow
demagogue
in
new
york
made
a
speech
only
a
few
days
ago
in
which
he
deliberately
and
in
cold
blood
advised
negroes
to
defend
themselves
to
the
death
when
attacked
by
white
people
i
remember
well
the
time
when
it
was
death
for
a
negro
to
strike
a
white
man
it
death
now
if
he
strikes
the
right
one
interjected
mcbane
restored
to
better
humor
by
this
mention
of
a
congenial
subject
the
general
smiled
a
fine
smile
he
had
heard
the
story
of
how
mcbane
had
lost
his
other
eye
the
local
negro
paper
is
quite
outspoken
too
continued
the
general
if
not
impudent
we
must
keep
track
of
that
it
may
furnish
us
some
good
campaign
material
yes
returned
carteret
we
must
see
to
that
i
threw
a
copy
into
the
this
morning
without
looking
at
it
here
it
is
now
ix
a
white
man
nigger
carteret
fished
from
the
depths
of
the
and
handed
to
the
general
an
eighteen
by
sheet
poorly
printed
on
cheap
paper
with
a
patent
inside
a
number
of
advertisements
of
proprietary
medicines
quack
doctors
and
and
two
or
three
columns
of
editorial
and
local
news
candor
compels
the
admission
that
it
was
not
an
impressive
sheet
in
any
respect
except
when
regarded
as
the
first
local
effort
of
a
struggling
people
to
make
public
expression
of
their
life
and
aspirations
from
this
point
of
view
it
did
not
speak
at
all
badly
for
a
class
to
whom
a
generation
before
newspapers
books
and
learning
had
been
forbidden
fruit
it
an
elegant
specimen
of
journalism
is
it
laughed
the
general
airily
listen
to
this
curly
hair
made
straight
by
one
application
of
our
specific
our
face
bleach
will
turn
the
skin
of
a
black
or
brown
person
four
or
five
shades
lighter
and
of
a
mulatto
perfectly
white
when
you
get
the
color
you
wish
stop
using
the
preparation
just
look
at
those
heads
using
and
using
better
hurry
or
there
be
no
negroes
to
disfranchise
if
they
stop
till
they
get
the
color
they
desire
and
the
stuff
works
according
to
contract
they
all
be
white
ah
what
have
we
here
this
looks
as
though
it
might
be
serious
opening
the
sheet
the
general
read
aloud
an
editorial
article
to
which
carteret
listened
intently
his
indignation
increasing
in
strength
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
while
mcbane
face
grew
darkly
purple
with
anger
the
article
was
a
frank
and
somewhat
bold
discussion
of
lynching
and
its
causes
it
denied
that
most
lynchings
were
for
the
offense
most
generally
charged
as
their
justification
and
declared
that
even
of
those
seemingly
traced
to
this
cause
many
were
not
for
crimes
at
all
but
for
voluntary
acts
which
might
naturally
be
expected
to
follow
from
the
miscegenation
laws
by
which
it
was
sought
in
all
the
southern
states
to
destroy
liberty
of
contract
and
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
a
fanciful
purity
of
race
to
make
crimes
of
marriages
to
which
neither
nature
nor
religion
nor
the
laws
of
other
states
interposed
any
insurmountable
barrier
such
an
article
in
a
northern
newspaper
would
have
attracted
no
special
attention
and
might
merely
have
furnished
food
to
an
occasional
reader
for
serious
thought
upon
a
subject
not
exactly
agreeable
but
coming
from
a
colored
man
in
a
southern
city
it
was
an
indictment
of
the
laws
and
social
system
of
the
south
that
could
not
fail
of
creating
a
profound
sensation
infamous
infamous
exclaimed
carteret
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
the
paper
should
be
suppressed
immediately
the
impudent
nigger
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
and
run
out
of
town
growled
mcbane
gentlemen
said
the
general
soothingly
after
the
first
burst
of
indignation
had
subsided
i
believe
we
can
find
a
more
effective
use
for
this
article
which
by
the
way
will
not
bear
too
close
analysis
there
some
truth
in
it
at
least
there
an
argument
that
is
not
the
point
interrupted
carteret
no
interjected
mcbane
with
an
oath
that
ai
at
all
the
point
truth
or
not
no
damn
nigger
has
any
right
to
say
it
this
article
said
carteret
violates
an
unwritten
law
of
the
south
if
we
are
to
tolerate
this
race
of
weaklings
among
us
until
they
are
eliminated
by
the
stress
of
competition
it
must
be
upon
terms
which
we
lay
down
one
of
our
conditions
is
violated
by
this
article
in
which
our
wisdom
is
assailed
and
our
women
made
the
subject
of
offensive
comment
we
must
make
known
our
disapproval
i
say
lynch
the
nigger
break
up
the
press
and
burn
down
the
newspaper
office
mcbane
responded
promptly
gentlemen
interposed
the
general
would
you
mind
suspending
the
discussion
for
a
moment
while
i
mind
jerry
across
the
street
i
think
i
can
then
suggest
a
better
plan
carteret
rang
the
bell
for
jerry
who
answered
promptly
he
had
been
expecting
such
a
call
ever
since
the
gentlemen
had
gone
in
jerry
said
the
general
step
across
to
brown
and
tell
him
to
send
me
three
calhoun
cocktails
wait
for
them
here
the
money
yas
suh
replied
jerry
taking
the
proffered
coin
and
make
charcoal
added
mcbane
for
we
gettin
damn
dry
a
momentary
cloud
of
annoyance
darkened
carteret
brow
mcbane
had
always
grated
upon
his
aristocratic
susceptibilities
the
captain
was
an
upstart
a
product
of
the
democratic
idea
operating
upon
the
poor
white
man
the
descendant
of
the
indentured
bondservant
and
the
socially
unfit
he
had
wealth
and
energy
however
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
use
of
him
but
the
example
of
such
men
was
a
strong
incentive
to
carteret
in
his
campaign
against
the
negro
it
was
distasteful
enough
to
rub
elbows
with
an
illiterate
and
vulgar
white
man
of
no
ancestry
the
risk
of
similar
contact
with
negroes
was
to
be
avoided
at
any
cost
he
could
hardly
expect
mcbane
to
be
a
gentleman
but
when
among
men
of
that
class
he
might
at
least
try
to
imitate
their
manners
a
gentleman
did
not
order
his
own
servants
around
offensively
to
say
nothing
of
another
the
general
had
observed
carteret
annoyance
and
remarked
pleasantly
while
they
waited
for
the
servant
return
jerry
now
is
a
very
good
negro
he
not
one
of
your
new
negroes
who
think
themselves
as
good
as
white
men
and
want
to
run
the
government
jerry
knows
his
place
he
is
respectful
humble
obedient
and
content
with
the
face
and
place
assigned
to
him
by
nature
yes
he
one
of
the
best
of
sneered
mcbane
he
call
any
man
for
a
quarter
or
for
half
a
dollar
for
a
dollar
grovel
at
your
feet
and
for
a
coat
you
can
buy
an
option
on
his
immortal
soul
if
he
has
one
i
handled
niggers
for
ten
years
and
i
know
from
the
ground
up
they
all
alike
they
a
scrub
race
an
affliction
to
the
country
and
the
quicker
we
rid
of
all
the
better
carteret
had
nothing
to
say
by
way
of
dissent
mcbane
sentiments
in
their
last
analysis
were
much
the
same
as
his
though
he
would
have
expressed
them
less
brutally
the
negro
observed
the
general
daintily
flicking
the
ash
from
his
cigar
is
all
right
in
his
place
and
very
useful
to
the
community
we
lived
on
his
labor
for
quite
a
long
time
and
lived
very
well
nevertheless
we
are
better
off
without
slavery
for
we
can
get
more
out
of
the
free
negro
and
with
less
responsibility
i
really
do
not
see
how
we
could
get
along
without
the
negroes
if
they
were
all
like
jerry
we
have
no
trouble
with
them
having
procured
the
drinks
jerry
the
momentary
subject
of
the
race
discussion
which
goes
on
eternally
in
the
south
was
making
his
way
back
across
the
street
somewhat
disturbed

while
jerry
stood
outside
the
conversation
within
was
plainly
audible
and
some
inkling
of
its
purport
filtered
through
his
mind
now
gentlemen
the
general
was
saying
here
my
plan
that
editorial
in
the
negro
newspaper
is
good
campaign
matter
but
we
should
reserve
it
until
it
will
be
most
effective
suppose
we
just
stick
it
in
a
and
let
the
editor
what
his
name
the
nigger
name
is
barber
replied
mcbane
i
like
to
have
him
under
me
for
a
month
or
two
he
write
no
more
editorials
let
barber
have
all
the
rope
he
wants
resumed
the
general
and
he
be
sure
to
hang
himself
in
the
mean
time
we
will
continue
to
work
up
public
opinion
we
can
use
this
letter
privately
for
that
purpose
and
when
the
state
campaign
opens
we
print
the
editorial
with
suitable
comment
scatter
it
broadcast
throughout
the
state
fire
the
southern
heart
organize
the
white
people
on
the
color
line
have
a
little
demonstration
with
red
shirts
and
shotguns
scare
the
negroes
into
fits
win
the
state
for
white
supremacy
and
teach
our
colored
fellow
citizens
that
we
are
tired
of
negro
domination
and
have
put
an
end
to
it
forever
the
banner
will
doubtless
die
about
the
same
time
and
so
will
the
editor
exclaimed
mcbane
ferociously
i
see
to
that
but
i
wonder
where
that
nigger
is
with
them
cocktails
i
so
thirsty
i
could
swallow
blue
blazes
here
yo
drinks
announced
jerry
entering
with
the
glasses
on
a
tray
the
gentlemen
exchanged
compliments
and
imbibed
mcbane
at
a
gulp
carteret
with
more
deliberation
leaving
about
half
the
contents
of
his
glass
the
general
drank
slowly
with
every
sign
of
appreciation
if
the
illustrious
statesman
he
observed
whose
name
this
mixture
bears
had
done
nothing
more
than
invent
it
his
fame
would
still
deserve
to
go
thundering
down
the
endless
ages
it
ai
bad
liquor
assented
mcbane
smacking
his
lips
jerry
received
the
empty
glasses
on
the
tray
and
left
the
room
he
had
scarcely
gained
the
hall

major
said
the
general
who
lingered
behind
mcbane
as
they
were
leaving
is
miss
clara
marriage
definitely
settled
upon
well
general
not
exactly
but
it
the
understanding
that
they
will
marry
when
they
are
old
enough
i
was
merely
thinking
the
general
went
on
that
if
i
were
you
speak
to
tom
about
cards
and
liquor
he
gives
more
time
to
both
than
a
young
man
can
afford
i
speaking
in
his
interest
and
in
miss
clara
we
of
the
old
families
ought
to
stand
together
thank
you
general
for
the
hint
i
act
upon
it
this
political
conference
was
fruitful
in
results
acting
upon
the
plans
there
laid
out
mcbane
traveled
extensively
through
the
state
working
up
sentiment
in
favor
of
the
new
movement
he
possessed
a
certain
forceful
eloquence
and
white
supremacy
was
so
obviously
the
divine
intention
that
he
had
merely
to
affirm
the
doctrine
in
order
to
secure
adherents
general
belmont
whose
business
required
him
to
spend
much
of
the
winter
in
washington
and
new
york
lost
no
opportunity
to
get
the
ear
of
lawmakers
editors
and
other
leaders
of
national
opinion
and
to
impress
upon
them
with
persuasive
eloquence
the
impossibility
of
maintaining
existing
conditions
and
the
tremendous
blunder
which
had
been
made
in
conferring
the
franchise
upon
the
emancipated
race
carteret
conducted
the
press
campaign
and
held
out
to
the
republicans
of
the
north
the
glittering
hope
that
with
the
elimination
of
the
negro
vote
and
a
proper
deference
to
southern
feeling
a
strong
white
republican
party
might
be
built
up
in
the
new
south
how
well
the
bait
took
is
a
matter
of
history
but
the
promised
result
is
still
in
the
future
the
disfranchisement
of
the
negro
has
merely
changed
the
form
of
the
same
old
problem
the
negro
had
no
vote
before
the
rebellion
and
few
other
rights
and
yet
the
negro
question
was
for
a
century
the
pivot
of
american
politics
it
plunged
the
nation
into
a
bloody
war
and
it
will
trouble
the
american
government
and
the
american
conscience
until
a
sustained
attempt
is
made
to
settle
it
upon
principles
of
justice
and
equity
the
personal
ambitions
entertained
by
the
leaders
of
this
movement
are
but
slightly
involved
in
this
story
mcbane
aims
have
been
touched
upon
elsewhere
the
general
would
have
accepted
the
nomination
for
governor
of
the
state
with
a
vision
of
a
senatorship
in
the
future
carteret
hoped
to
vindicate
the
supremacy
of
his
race
and
make
the
state
fit
for
his
son
to
live
in
and
incidentally
he
would
not
refuse
any
office
worthy
of
his
dignity
which
a
grateful
people
might
thrust
upon
him
so
powerful
a
combination
of
bigot
demagogue
and
astute
politician
was
fraught
with
grave
menace
to
the
peace
of
the
state
and
the
liberties
of
the
people
by
which
is
meant
the
whole
people
and
not
any
one
class
sought
to
be
built
up
at
the
expense
of
another
x
delamere
plays
a
trump
carteret
did
not
forget
what
general
belmont
had
said
in
regard
to
tom
the
major
himself
had
been
young
not
so
very
long
ago
and
was
inclined
toward
indulgence
for
the
foibles
of
youth
a
young
gentleman
should
have
a
certain
knowledge
of
life
but
there
were
limits
clara
future
happiness
must
not
be
imperiled
the
opportunity
to
carry
out
this
purpose
was
not
long
delayed
old
delamere
wished
to
sell
some
timber
which
had
been
cut
at
belleview
and
sent
tom
down
to
the
chronicle
office
to
leave
an
advertisement
the
major
saw
him
at
the
desk
invited
him
into
his
sanctum
and
delivered
him
a
mild
lecture
the
major
was
kind
and
talked
in
a
fatherly
way
about
the
danger
of
extremes
the
beauty
of
moderation
and
the
value
of
discretion
as
a
rule
of
conduct
he
mentioned
collaterally
the
unblemished
honor
of
a
fine
old
family
its
contemplated
alliance
with
his
own
and
dwelt
upon
the
sweet
simplicity
of
clara
character
the
major
was
a
man
of
feeling
and
of
tact
and
could
not
have
put
the
subject
in
a
way
less
calculated
to
wound
the
of
a
very
young
man
delamere
had
turned
red
with
anger
while
the
major
was
speaking
he
was
impulsive
and
an
effort
was
required
to
keep
back
the
retort
that
sprang
once
or
twice
to
his
lips
but
his
conscience
was
not
clear
and
he
could
not
afford
hard
words
with
clara
guardian
and
his
grandfather
friend
clara
was
rich
and
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
town
they
were
engaged
he
loved
her
as
well
as
he
could
love
anything
of
which
he
seemed
sure
and
he
did
not
mean
that
any
one
else
should
have
her
the
major
mild
censure
disturbed
slightly
his
sense
of
security
and
while
the
major
manner
did
not
indicate
that
he
knew
anything
definite
against
him
it
would
be
best
to
let
well
enough
alone
thank
you
major
he
said
with
frankness
i
realize
that
i
may
have
been
a
little
careless
more
from
thoughtlessness
than
anything
else
but
my
heart
is
all
right
sir
and
i
am
glad
that
my
conduct
has
been
brought
to
your
attention
for
what
you
have
said
enables
me
to
see
it
in
a
different
light
i
will
be
more
careful
of
my
company
hereafter
for
i
love
clara
and
mean
to
try
to
be
worthy
of
her
do
you
know
whether
she
will
be
at
home
this
evening
i
have
heard
nothing
to
the
contrary
replied
the
major
warmly
call
her
up
by
telephone
and
ask
or
come
up
and
see
you
always
welcome
my
boy
upon
leaving
the
office
which
was
on
the
second
floor
tom
met
ellis
coming
up
the
stairs
it
had
several
times
of
late
occurred
to
tom
that
ellis
had
a
sneaking
fondness
for
clara
panoplied
in
his
own
engagement
tom
had
heretofore
rather
enjoyed
the
idea
of
a
hopeless
rival
ellis
was
such
a
solemn
prig
and
took
life
so
seriously
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
him
sit
around
sighing
for
the
unattainable
that
he
should
be
giving
pain
to
ellis
added
a
certain
zest
to
his
own
enjoyment
but
this
interview
with
the
major
had
so
disquieted
him
that
upon
meeting
ellis
upon
the
stairs
he
was
struck
by
a
sudden
suspicion
he
knew
that
major
carteret
seldom
went
to
the
clarendon
club
and
that
he
must
have
got
his
information
from
some
one
else
ellis
was
a
member
of
the
club
and
a
frequent
visitor
who
more
likely
than
he
to
try
to
poison
clara
mind
or
the
minds
of
her
friends
against
her
accepted
lover
tom
did
not
think
that
the
world
was
using
him
well
of
late
bad
luck
had
pursued
him
in
cards
and
other
things
and
despite
his
assumption
of
humility
carteret
lecture
had
left
him
in
an
ugly
mood
he
nodded
curtly
to
ellis
without
relaxing
the
scowl
that
disfigured
his
handsome
features
that
the
damned
sneak
who
been
giving
me
away
he
muttered
get
even
with
him
yet
for
this
delamere
suspicions
with
regard
to
ellis
feelings
were
not
as
we
have
seen
entirely
without
foundation
indeed
he
had
underestimated
the
strength
of
this
rivalry
and
its
chances
of
success
ellis
had
been
watching
delamere
for
a
year
there
had
been
nothing
surreptitious
about
it
but
his
interest
in
clara
had
led
him
to
note
things
about
his
favored
rival
which
might
have
escaped
the
attention
of
others
less
concerned
ellis
was
an
excellent
judge
of
character
and
had
formed
a
very
decided
opinion
of
tom
delamere
to
ellis
unbiased
by
ancestral
traditions
biased
perhaps
by
jealousy
tom
delamere
was
a
type
of
the
degenerate
aristocrat
if
as
he
had
often
heard
it
took
three
or
four
generations
to
make
a
gentleman
and
as
many
more
to
complete
the
curve
and
return
to
the
base
from
which
it
started
tom
delamere
belonged
somewhere
on
the
downward
slant
with
large
possibilities
of
further
decline
old
delamere
who
might
be
taken
as
the
apex
of
an
ideal
aristocratic
development
had
been
distinguished
during
his
active
life
as
ellis
had
learned
for
courage
and
strength
of
will
courtliness
of
bearing
deference
to
his
superiors
of
whom
there
had
been
few
courtesy
to
his
equals
kindness
and
consideration
for
those
less
highly
favored
and
above
all
a
scrupulous
sense
of
honor
his
grandson
tom
was
merely
the
shadow
without
the
substance
the
empty
husk
without
the
grain
of
grace
he
had
plenty
in
manners
he
could
be
perfect
when
he
so
chose
courage
and
strength
he
had
none
ellis
had
seen
this
fellow
who
boasted
of
his
descent
from
a
line
of
cavaliers
turn
pale
with
fright
and
spring
from
a
buggy
to
which
was
harnessed
a
fractious
horse
which
a
negro
drove
fearlessly
a
valiant
skilled
in
all
parlor
exercises
great
at
whist
or
euchre
a
dream
of
a
dancer
unexcelled
in
cakewalk
or
coon
impersonations
for
which
he
was
in
large
social
demand
ellis
had
seen
him
kick
an
inoffensive
negro
out
of
his
path
and
treat
a
man
with
scant
courtesy
he
suspected
delamere
of
cheating
at
cards
and
knew
that
others
entertained
the
same
suspicion
for
while
regular
in
his
own
habits
his
poverty
would
not
have
permitted
him
any
considerable
extravagance
ellis
position
as
a
newspaper
man
kept
him
in
touch
with
what
was
going
on
about
town
he
was
a
member
proposed
by
carteret
of
the
clarendon
club
where
cards
were
indulged
in
within
reasonable
limits
and
a
certain
set
were
known
to
bet
dollars
in
terms
of
dimes
delamere
was
careless
too
about
money
matters
he
had
a
habit
of
borrowing
right
and
left
small
sums
which
might
be
conveniently
forgotten
by
the
borrower
and
for
which
the
lender
would
dislike
to
ask
ellis
had
a
strain
of
thrift
derived
from
a
scotch
ancestry
and
a
tenacious
memory
for
financial
details
indeed
he
had
never
had
so
much
money
that
he
could
lose
track
of
it
he
never
saw
delamere
without
being
distinctly
conscious
that
delamere
owed
him
four
dollars
which
he
had
lent
at
a
time
when
he
could
ill
afford
to
spare
it
it
was
a
prerogative
of
aristocracy
ellis
reflected
to
live
upon
others
and
the
last
privilege
which
aristocracy
in
decay
would
willingly
relinquish
neither
did
the
aristocratic
memory
seem
able
to
retain
the
sordid
details
of
a
small
pecuniary
transaction
no
doubt
the
knowledge
that
delamere
was
the
favored
lover
of
miss
pemberton
lent
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
ellis
reflections
upon
his
rival
ellis
had
no
grievance
against
the
aristocracy
of
wellington
the
best
people
had
received
him
cordially
though
his
father
had
not
been
of
their
caste
but
ellis
hated
a
hypocrite
and
despised
a
coward
and
he
felt
sure
that
delamere
was
both
otherwise
he
would
have
struggled
against
his
love
for
clara
pemberton
his
passion
for
her
had
grown
with
his
appreciation
of
delamere
unworthiness
as
a
friend
of
the
family
he
knew
the
nature
and
terms
of
the
engagement
and
that
if
the
marriage
took
place
at
all
it
would
not
be
for
at
least
a
year
this
was
a
long
time
many
things
might
happen
in
a
year
especially
to
a
man
like
tom
delamere
if
for
any
reason
delamere
lost
his
chance
ellis
meant
to
be
next
in
the
field
he
had
not
made
love
to
clara
but
he
had
missed
no
opportunity
of
meeting
her
and
making
himself
quietly
and
unobtrusively
agreeable
on
the
day
after
this
encounter
with
delamere
on
the
stairs
of
the
chronicle
office
ellis
while
walking
down
vine
street
met
old
ochiltree
she
was
seated
in
her
own
buggy
which
was
of
ancient
build
and
pattern
driven
by
her
colored
coachman
and
man
of
all
work
ellis
she
called
in
a
shrill
voice
having
directed
her
coachman
to
draw
up
at
the
curb
as
she
saw
the
young
man
approaching
come
here
i
want
to
speak
to
you
ellis
came
up
to
the
buggy
and
stood
uncovered
beside
it
people
are
saying
said
ochiltree
that
tom
delamere
is
drinking
hard
and
has
to
be
carried
home
intoxicated
two
or
three
times
a
week
by
old
delamere
man
sandy
is
there
any
truth
in
the
story
my
dear
ochiltree
i
am
not
tom
delamere
keeper
sandy
could
tell
you
better
than
i
you
are
dodging
my
question
ellis
sandy
would
tell
me
the
truth
and
i
know
that
you
would
lie
you
do
look
like
a
liar
they
say
tom
is
gambling
scandalously
what
do
you
know
about
that
you
must
excuse
me
ochiltree
a
great
deal
of
what
we
hear
is
mere
idle
gossip
and
the
truth
is
often
grossly
exaggerated
i
a
member
of
the
same
club
with
delamere
and
gentlemen
who
belong
to
the
same
club
are
not
in
the
habit
of
talking
about
one
another
as
long
as
a
man
retains
his
club
membership
he
presumed
to
be
a
gentleman
i
would
say
anything
against
delamere
if
i
could
you
do
need
to
replied
the
old
lady
shaking
her
finger
at
him
with
a
cunning
smile
you
are
a
very
open
young
man
ellis
and
i
can
read
you
like
a
book
you
are
much
smarter
than
you
look
but
you
ca
fool
me
ochiltree
drove
immediately
to
her
niece
where
she
found
carteret
and
clara
at
home
clara
was
very
fond
of
the
baby
and
was
holding
him
in
her
arms
he
was
a
fine
baby
and
bade
fair
to
realize
the
bright
hopes
built
upon
him
you
hold
a
baby
very
naturally
clara
chuckled
the
old
lady
i
suppose
you
are
in
training
but
you
ought
to
talk
to
tom
i
have
just
learned
from
ellis
that
tom
is
carried
home
drunk
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
that
he
is
gambling
in
the
most
reckless
manner
imaginable
clara
eyes
flashed
indignantly
ere
she
could
speak
carteret
exclaimed
why
aunt
polly
did
ellis
say
that
i
got
it
from
dinah
she
replied
who
heard
it
from
her
husband
who
learned
it
from
a
waiter
at
the
club
and
pshaw
said
carteret
mere
servants
gossip
no
it
is
olivia
i
met
ellis
on
the
street
and
asked
him
point
blank
and
he
did
deny
it
he
a
member
of
the
club
and
ought
to
know
well
aunt
polly
it
ca
be
true
tom
is
here
every
other
night
and
how
could
he
carry
on
so
without
showing
the
signs
of
it
and
where
would
he
get
the
money
you
know
he
has
only
a
moderate
allowance
he
may
win
it
at
cards
it
better
to
be
born
lucky
than
rich
returned
ochiltree
then
he
has
expectations
and
can
get
credit
there
no
doubt
that
tom
is
going
on
shamefully
indignation
had
not
yet
found
vent
in
speech
olivia
had
said
all
that
was
necessary
but
she
had
been
thinking
rapidly
even
if
all
this
had
been
true
why
should
ellis
have
said
it
or
if
he
had
not
stated
it
directly
he
had
left
the
inference
to
be
drawn
it
seemed
a
most
unfair
and
ungentlemanly
thing
what
motive
could
ellis
have
for
such
an
act
she
was
not
long
in
reaching
a
conclusion
which
was
not
flattering
to
ellis
ellis
came
often
to
the
house
and
she
had
enjoyed
his
society
in
a
friendly
way
that
he
had
found
her
pleasant
company
had
been
very
evident
she
had
never
taken
his
attentions
seriously
however
or
regarded
his
visits
as
made
especially
to
her
nor
had
the
rest
of
the
family
treated
them
from
that
point
of
view
her
engagement
to
tom
delamere
though
not
yet
formally
ratified
was
so
well
understood
by
the
world
of
wellington
that
ellis
would
scarcely
have
presumed
to
think
of
her
as
anything
more
than
a
friend
this
revelation
of
her
aunt
however
put
a
different
face
upon
his
conduct
certain
looks
and
sighs
and
enigmatical
remarks
of
ellis
to
which
she
had
paid
but
casual
attention
and
attached
no
particular
significance
now
recurred
to
her
memory
with
a
new
meaning
he
had
now
evidently
tried
in
a
roundabout
way
to
besmirch
tom
character
and
undermine
him
in
her
regard
while
loving
tom
she
had
liked
ellis
well
enough
as
a
friend
but
he
had
abused
the
privileges
of
friendship
and
she
would
teach
him
a
needed
lesson
nevertheless
ochiltree
story
had
given
clara
food
for
thought
she
was
uneasily
conscious
after
all
that
there
might
be
a
grain
of
truth
in
what
had
been
said
enough
at
least
to
justify
her
in
warning
tom
to
be
careful
lest
his
enemies
should
distort
some
amiable
weakness
into
a
serious
crime
she
put
this
view
of
the
case
to
tom
at
their
next
meeting
assuring
him
at
the
same
time
of
her
unbounded
faith
and
confidence
she
did
not
mention
ellis
name
lest
tom
in
righteous
indignation
might
do
something
rash
which
he
might
thereafter
regret
if
any
subtler
or
more
obscure
motive
kept
her
silent
as
to
ellis
she
was
not
aware
of
it
for
clara
views
of
life
were
still
in
the
objective
stage
and
she
had
not
yet
fathomed
the
deepest
recesses
of
her
own
consciousness
delamere
had
the
cunning
of
weakness
he
knew
too
better
than
any
one
else
could
know
how
much
truth
there
was
in
the
rumors
concerning
him
and
whether
or
not
they
could
be
verified
too
easily
for
him
to
make
an
indignant
denial
after
a
little
rapid
reflection
he
decided
upon
a
different
course
clara
he
said
with
a
sigh
taking
the
hand
which
she
generously
yielded
to
soften
any
suggestion
of
reproach
which
he
may
have
read
into
her
solicitude
you
are
my
guardian
angel
i
do
not
know
of
course
who
has
told
you
this
pack
of
lies
for
i
can
see
that
you
have
heard
more
than
you
have
told
me
but
i
think
i
could
guess
the
man
they
came
from
i
am
not
perfect
clara
though
i
have
done
nothing
of
which
a
gentleman
should
be
ashamed
there
is
one
sure
way
to
stop
the
tongue
of
calumny
my
home
life
is
not
ideal
grandfather
is
an
old
weak
man
and
the
house
needs
the
refining
and
softening
influence
of
a
presence
i
do
not
love
club
life
its
ideals
are
not
elevating
with
you
by
my
side
dearest
i
should
be
preserved
from
every
influence
except
the
purest
and
the
best
do
you
think
dearest
that
the
major
might
be
induced
to
shorten
our
weary
term
of
waiting
oh
tom
she
demurred
blushingly
i
shall
be
young
enough
at
eighteen
and
you
are
barely
but
tom
proved
an
eloquent
pleader
and
love
a
still
more
persuasive
advocate
clara
spoke
to
the
major
the
same
evening
who
looked
grave
at
the
suggestion
and
said
he
would
think
about
it
they
were
both
very
young
but
where
both
parties
were
of
good
family
in
good
health
and
good
circumstances
an
early
marriage
might
not
be
undesirable
tom
was
perhaps
a
little
unsettled
but
blood
would
tell
in
the
long
run
and
marriage
always
exercised
a
steadying
influence
the
only
return
therefore
which
ellis
received
for
his
effort
to
ward
off
ochiltree
embarrassing
inquiries
was
that
he
did
not
see
clara
upon
his
next
visit
which
was
made
one
afternoon
while
he
was
on
night
duty
at
the
office
in
conversation
with
carteret
he
learned
that
clara
marriage
had
been
definitely
agreed
upon
and
the
date
fixed
it
was
to
take
place
in
about
six
months
meeting
miss
pemberton
on
the
street
the
following
day
he
received
the
slightest
of
nods
when
he
called
again
at
the
house
after
a
week
of
misery
she
treated
him
with
a
sarcastic
coolness
which
chilled
his
heart
how
have
i
offended
you
miss
clara
he
demanded
desperately
when
they
were
left
alone
for
a
moment
offended
me
she
replied
lifting
her
eyebrows
with
an
air
of
puzzled
surprise
why
ellis
what
could
have
put
such
a
notion
into
your
head
oh
dear
i
think
i
hear
dodie
i
know
you
excuse
me
ellis
wo
you
sister
olivia
will
be
back
in
a
moment
and
expecting
aunt
polly
this
afternoon
if
you
stay
awhile
she
be
glad
to
talk
to
you
you
can
tell
her
all
the
interesting
news
about
your
friends
xi
the
baby
and
the
bird
when
ellis
after
this
rebuff
had
disconsolately
taken
his
leave
clara
much
elated
at
the
righteous
punishment
she
had
inflicted
upon
the
slanderer
ran
upstairs
to
the
nursery
and
snatching
dodie
from
mammy
jane
arms
began
dancing
gayly
with
him
round
the
room
look
honey
said
mammy
jane
you
better
be
keerful
wid
dat
chile
an
don
drap
on
de
flo
you
might
let
him
fall
on
his

an
break
his

my

but
you
two
does
make
a
pretty
pictur
you
be
wantin
ole
jane
ter
come
an
nuss
yo
some
er
dese
days
she
chuckled
unctuously
mammy
jane
had
been
very
much
disturbed
by
the
recent
dangers
through
which
little
dodie
had
passed
and
his
escape
from
strangulation
in
the
first
place
and
then
from
the
knife
had
impressed
her
as
little
less
than
miraculous
she
was
not
certain
whether
this
result
had
been
brought
about
by
her
manipulation
of
the
buried
charm
or
by
the
prayers
which
had
been
offered
for
the
child
but
was
inclined
to
believe
that
both
had
cooperated
to
avert
the
threatened
calamity
the
favorable
outcome
of
this
particular
incident
had
not
however
altered
the
general
situation
prayers
and
charms
after
all
were
merely
temporary
things
which
must
be
constantly
renewed
and
might
be
forgotten
or
overlooked
while
the
mole
on
the
contrary
neither
faded
nor
went
away
if
its
malign
influence
might
for
a
time
seem
to
disappear
it
was
merely
lying
dormant
like
the
germs
of
some
deadly
disease
awaiting
its
opportunity
to
strike
at
an
unguarded
spot
clara
and
the
baby
were
laughing
in
great
glee
when
a
mockingbird
perched
on
the
topmost
bough
of
a
small
tree
opposite
the
nursery
window
burst
suddenly
into
song
with
many
a
trill
and
quaver
clara
with
the
child
in
her
arms
sprang
to
the
open
window
sister
olivia
she
cried
turning
her
face
toward
carteret
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
come
and
look
at
dodie
the
baby
was
listening
intently
to
the
music
meanwhile
gurgling
with
delight
and
reaching
his
chubby
hands
toward
the
source
of
this
pleasing
sound
it
seemed
as
though
the
mockingbird
were
aware
of
his
appreciative
audience
for
he
ran
through
the
songs
of
a
dozen
different
birds
selecting
with
the
discrimination
of
a
connoisseur
and
entire
confidence
in
his
own
powers
those
which
were
most
difficult
and
most
alluring
carteret
approached
the
window
followed
by
mammy
jane
who
waddled
over
to
join
the
admiring
party
so
absorbed
were
the
three
women
in
the
baby
and
the
bird
that
neither
one
of
them
observed
a
neat
top
buggy
drawn
by
a
sleek
sorrel
pony
passing
slowly
along
the
street
before
the
house
in
the
buggy
was
seated
a
lady
and
beside
her
a
little
boy
dressed
in
a
child
sailor
suit
and
a
straw
hat
the
lady
with
a
wistful
expression
was
looking
toward
the
party
grouped
in
the
open
window
carteret
chancing
to
lower
her
eyes
for
an
instant
caught
the
other
woman
look
directed
toward
her
and
her
child
with
a
glance
of
cold
aversion
she
turned
away
from
the
window
old
mammy
jane
had
observed
this
movement
and
had
divined
the
reason
for
it
she
stood
beside
clara
watching
the
retreating
buggy
uhhuh
she
said
to
herself

meantime
janet
stung
by
carteret
look
the
nearest
approach
she
had
ever
made
to
a
recognition
of
her
sister
existence
had
turned
away
with
hardening
face
she
had
struck
her
pony
sharply
with
the
whip
much
to
the
gentle
creature
surprise
when
the
little
boy
who
was
still
looking
back
caught
his
mother
sleeve
and
exclaimed
excitedly
look
look
mamma
the
baby
the
baby
janet
turned
instantly
and
with
a
mother
instinct
gave
an
involuntary
cry
of
alarm
at
the
moment
when
carteret
had
turned
away
from
the
window
and
while
mammy
jane
was
watching
janet
clara
had
taken
a
step
forward
and
was
leaning
against
the
the
baby
convulsed
with
delight
had
given
a
spasmodic
spring
and
slipped
from
clara
arms
instinctively
the
young
woman
gripped
the
long
skirt
as
it
slipped
through
her
hands
and
held
it
tenaciously
though
too
frightened
for
an
instant
to
do
more
mammy
jane
ashen
with
sudden
dread
uttered
an
inarticulate
scream
but
retained
enough
to
reach
down
and
draw
up
the
child
which
hung
dangerously
suspended
head
downward
over
the
brick
pavement
below
oh
clara
clara
how
could
you
exclaimed
carteret
reproachfully
you
might
have
killed
my
child
she
had
snatched
the
child
from
jane
arms
and
was
holding
him
closely
to
her
own
breast
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
she
drew
near
the
window
and
looked
out
twice
within
a
few
weeks
her
child
had
been
in
serious
danger
and
upon
each
occasion
a
member
of
the
miller
family
had
been
involved
for
she
had
heard
of
miller
presumption
in
trying
to
force
himself
where
he
must
have
known
he
would
be
unwelcome
janet
was
just
turning
her
head
away
as
the
buggy
moved
slowly
off
olivia
felt
a
violent
wave
of
antipathy
sweep
over
her
toward
this
baseborn
sister
who
had
thus
thrust
herself
beneath
her
eyes
if
she
had
not
cast
her
brazen
glance
toward
the
window
she
herself
would
not
have
turned
away
and
lost
sight
of
her
child
to
this
shameless
intrusion
linked
with
clara
carelessness
had
been
due
the
catastrophe
so
narrowly
averted
which
might
have
darkened
her
own
life
forever
she
took
to
her
bed
for
several
days
and
for
a
long
time
was
cold
toward
clara
and
did
not
permit
her
to
touch
the
child
mammy
jane
entertained
a
theory
of
her
own
about
the
accident
by
which
the
blame
was
placed
in
another
way
exactly
where
carteret
had
laid
it
julia
daughter
janet
had
been
looking
intently
toward
the
window
just
before
little
dodie
had
sprung
from
clara
arms
might
she
not
have
cast
the
evil
eye
upon
the
baby
and
sought
thereby
to
draw
him
out
of
the
window
one
would
not
ordinarily
expect
so
young
a
woman
to
possess
such
a
power
but
she
might
have
acquired
it
for
this
very
purpose
from
some
more
experienced
person
by
the
same
reasoning
the
mockingbird
might
have
been
a
familiar
of
the
witch
and
the
two
might
have
conspired
to
lure
the
infant
to
destruction
whether
this
were
so
or
not
the
transaction
at
least
wore
a
peculiar
look
there
was
no
use
telling
mis
about
it
for
she
did
believe
or
pretended
not
to
believe
in
witchcraft
and
conjuration
but
one
could
not
be
too
careful
the
child
was
certainly
born
to
be
exposed
to
great
dangers
the
mole
behind
the
left
ear
was
an
unfailing
sign
and
no
precaution
should
be
omitted
to
counteract
its
baleful
influence
while
adjusting
the
baby
crib
a
few
days
later
carteret
found
fastened
under
one
of
the
slats
a
small
bag
of
cotton
cloth
about
half
an
inch
long
and
tied
with
a
black
thread
upon
opening
which
she
found
a
few
small
roots
or
fibres
and
a
pinch
of
dried
and
crumpled
herbs
it
was
a
charm
which
mammy
jane
had
placed
there
to
ward
off
the
threatened
evil
from
the
grandchild
of
her
dear
old
mistress
carteret
first
impulse
was
to
throw
the
bag
into
the
fire
but
on
second
thoughts
she
let
it
remain
to
remove
it
would
give
unnecessary
pain
to
the
old
nurse
of
course
these
old
negro
superstitions
were
absurd
but
if
the
charm
did
no
good
it
at
least
would
do
no
harm
xii
another
southern
product
one
morning
shortly
after
the
opening
of
the
hospital
while
miller
was
making
his
early
rounds
a
new
patient
walked
in
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
a
broken
arm
hanging
limply
by
his
side
miller
recognized
in
him
a
black
giant
by
the
name
of
josh
green
who
for
many
years
had
worked
on
the
docks
for
miller
father
and
simultaneously
identified
him
as
the
negro
who
had
stolen
a
ride
to
wellington
on
the
trucks
of
a
passenger
car
well
josh
asked
the
doctor
as
he
examined
the
fracture
how
did
you
get
this
been
fighting
again
no
suh
i
don
you
could

it

a
broken
arm
he
got
holt
er
a
befo
i
could
hit
what
became
of
the
other
man
demanded
miller
suspiciously
he
perceived
from
the
indifference
with
which
josh
bore
the
manipulation
of
the
fractured
limb
that
such
an
accident
need
not
have
interfered
seriously
with
the
use
of
the
remaining
arm
and
he
knew
that
josh
had
a
reputation
for
absolute
fearlessness
lem
me
see
said
josh
reflectively
ef
i

oh

and

health
right
along
it
was
considerate
of
you
to
spare
his
life
said
miller
dryly
but
you
hit
the
wrong
man
some
day
these
are
bad
times
for
bad
negroes
you
get
into
a
quarrel
with
a
white
man
and
at
the
end
of
it
be
a
lynching
or
a
funeral
you
better
be
peaceable
and
endure
a
little
injustice
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
a
sudden
and
violent
death
i
expec
ter
die
a
death
in

wid

replied
josh
in
a
tone
an
he
gwine

die
at
the

josh
was
evidently
in
dead
earnest
miller
recalled
very
vividly
the
expression
he
had
seen
twice
on
his
patient
face
during
the
journey
to
wellington
he
had
often
seen
josh
mother
old
aunt
milly
silly
milly
the
children
called
her
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
street
muttering
to
herself
incoherently
he
had
felt
a
certain
childish
awe
at
the
sight
of
one
of
god
creatures
who
had
lost
the
light
of
reason
and
he
had
always
vaguely
understood
that
she
was
the
victim
of
human
cruelty
though
he
had
dated
it
farther
back
into
the
past
this
was
his
first
knowledge
of
the
real
facts
of
the
case
he
realized
too
for
a
moment
the
continuity
of
life
how
inseparably
the
present
is
woven
with
the
past
how
certainly
the
future
will
be
but
the
outcome
of
the
present
he
had
supposed
this
old
wound
healed
the
negroes
were
not
a
vindictive
people
if
swayed
by
passion
or
emotion
they
sometimes
gave
way
to
gusts
of
rage
these
were
of
brief
duration
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
their
doubtful
present
and
their
uncertain
future
they
gave
little
thought
to
the
past
it
was
a
dark
story
which
they
would
willingly
forget
he
knew
the
timeworn
explanation
that
the
movement
in
the
main
was
merely
an
ebullition
of
boyish
spirits
begun
to
amuse
young
white
men
by
playing
upon
the
fears
and
superstitions
of
ignorant
negroes
here
however
was
its
tragic
side
the
old
wound
still
bleeding
the
fruit
of
one
tragedy
the
seed
of
another
he
could
not
approve
of
josh
application
of
the
mosaic
law
of
revenge
and
yet
the
incident
was
not
without
significance
here
was
a
negro
who
could
remember
an
injury
who
could
shape
his
life
to
a
definite
purpose
if
not
a
high
or
holy
one
when
his
race
reached
the
point
where
they
would
resent
a
wrong
there
was
hope
that
they
might
soon
attain
the
stage
where
they
would
try
and
if
need
be
die
to
defend
a
right
this
man
too
had
a
purpose
in
life
and
was
willing
to
die
that
he
might
accomplish
it
miller
was
willing
to
give
up
his
life
to
a
cause
would
he
be
equally
willing
he
asked
himself
to
die
for
it
miller
had
no
prophetic
instinct
to
tell
him
how
soon
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
answer
his
own
question
but
he
could
not
encourage
josh
to
carry
out
this
dark
and
revengeful
purpose
every
worthy
consideration
required
him
to
dissuade
his
patient
from
such
a
desperate
course
you
had
better
put
away
these
murderous
fancies
josh
he
said
seriously
the
bible
says
that
we
should
our
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
us
and
do
good
to
them
that
despitefully
use
us

josh
said
the
doctor
laying
a
cool
hand
on
the
other
brow
you
feverish
and
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
let
my
mind
dwell
on
such
things
and
you
must
keep
quiet
until
this
arm
is
well
or
you
may
never
be
able
to
hit
any
one
with
it
again
miller
determined
that
when
josh
got
better
he
would
talk
to
him
seriously
and
dissuade
him
from
this
dangerous
design
he
had
not
asked
the
name
of
josh
enemy
but
the
look
of
murderous
hate
which
the
tramp
of
the
railway
journey
had
cast
at
captain
george
mcbane
rendered
any
such
question
superfluous
mcbane
was
probably
deserving
of
any
evil
fate
which
might
befall
him
but
such
a
revenge
would
do
no
good
would
right
no
wrong
while
every
such
crime
committed
by
a
colored
man
would
be
imputed
to
the
race
which
was
already
staggering
under
a
load
of
obloquy
because
in
the
eyes
of
a
prejudiced
and
undiscriminating
public
it
must
answer
as
a
whole
for
the
offenses
of
each
separate
individual
to
die
in
defense
of
the
right
was
heroic
to
kill
another
for
revenge
was
pitifully
human
and
weak
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
xiii
the
cakewalk
old
delamere
servant
sandy
campbell
was
in
deep
trouble
a
party
of
northern
visitors
had
been
staying
for
several
days
at
the
james
hotel
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
were
concerned
in
a
projected
cotton
mill
while
the
ladies
were
much
interested
in
the
study
of
social
conditions
and
especially
in
the
negro
problem
as
soon
as
their
desire
for
information
became
known
they
were
taken
courteously
under
the
wing
of
prominent
citizens
and
their
wives
who
gave
them
at
elaborate
luncheons
the
southern
white
man
views
of
the
negro
sighing
sentimentally
over
the
disappearance
of
the
good
old
negro
of
before
the
war
and
gravely
deploring
the
degeneracy
of
his
descendants
they
enlarged
upon
the
amount
of
money
the
southern
whites
had
spent
for
the
education
of
the
negro
and
shook
their
heads
over
the
inadequate
results
accruing
from
this
unexampled
generosity
it
was
sad
they
said
to
witness
this
spectacle
of
a
dying
race
unable
to
withstand
the
competition
of
a
superior
type
the
severe
reprisals
taken
by
white
people
for
certain
crimes
committed
by
negroes
were
of
course
not
the
acts
of
the
best
people
who
deplored
them
but
still
a
certain
charity
should
be
extended
towards
those
who
in
the
intense
and
righteous
anger
of
the
moment
should
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
deal
out
rough
but
still
substantial
justice
for
no
negro
was
ever
lynched
without
incontestable
proof
of
his
guilt
in
order
to
be
perfectly
fair
and
give
their
visitors
an
opportunity
to
see
both
sides
of
the
question
they
accompanied
the
northern
visitors
to
a
colored
church
where
they
might
hear
a
colored
preacher
who
had
won
a
jocular
popularity
throughout
the
whole
country
by
an
sermon
intended
to
demonstrate
that
the
earth
was
flat
like
a
pancake
this
celebrated
divine
could
always
draw
a
white
audience
except
on
the
days
when
his
no
less
distinguished
white
rival
in
the
field
of
sensationalism
preached
his
equally
famous
sermon
to
prove
that
hell
was
exactly
one
half
mile
linear
measure
from
the
city
limits
of
wellington
whether
accidentally
or
not
the
northern
visitors
had
no
opportunity
to
meet
or
talk
alone
with
any
colored
person
in
the
city
except
the
servants
at
the
hotel
when
one
of
the
party
suggested
a
visit
to
the
colored
mission
school
a
southern
friend
kindly
volunteered
to
accompany
them
the
visitors
were
naturally
much
impressed
by
what
they
learned
from
their
courteous
hosts
and
felt
inclined
to
sympathize
with
the
southern
people
for
the
negro
is
not
counted
as
a
southerner
except
to
fix
the
basis
of
congressional
representation
there
might
of
course
be
things
to
criticise
here
and
there
certain
customs
for
which
they
did
not
exactly
see
the
necessity
and
which
seemed
in
conflict
with
the
highest
ideals
of
liberty
but
surely
these
courteous
ladies
and
gentlemen
entirely
familiar
with
local
conditions
who
descanted
so
earnestly
and
at
times
pathetically
upon
the
grave
problems
confronting
them
must
know
more
about
it
than
people
in
the
distant
north
without
their
means
of
information
the
negroes
who
waited
on
them
at
the
hotel
seemed
happy
enough
and
the
teachers
whom
they
had
met
at
the
mission
school
had
been
and
apparently
content
with
their
position
in
life
surely
a
people
who
made
no
complaints
could
not
be
very
much
oppressed
in
order
to
give
the
visitors
ere
they
left
wellington
a
pleasing
impression
of
southern
customs
and
particularly
of
the
joyous
disposition
of
the
southern
darky
and
his
entire
contentment
with
existing
conditions
it
was
decided
by
the
hotel
management
to
treat
them
on
the
last
night
of
their
visit
to
a
little
diversion
in
the
shape
of
a
genuine
negro
cakewalk
on
the
afternoon
of
this
same
day
tom
delamere
strolled
into
the
hotel
and
soon
gravitated
to
the
bar
where
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
young
men
of
leisure
spent
much
of
their
time
around
the
hotel
and
no
small
part
of
it
in
the
bar
delamere
had
been
to
the
club
but
had
avoided
the
time
hanging
heavy
on
his
hands
he
had
sought
the
hotel
in
the
hope
that
some
form
of
distraction
might
present
itself
have
you
heard
the
latest
mr
delamere
asked
the
bartender
as
he
mixed
a
cocktail
for
his
customer
no
billy
what
is
it
there
to
be
a
big
cakewalk
upstairs
the
gentlemen
an
ladies
who
are
down
here
to
see
about
the
new
cotton
want
to
study
the
nigger
some
more
and
the
boss
has
got
up
a
cakewalk
for
the
waiters
and
chambermaids
with
a
little
outside
talent
is
it
to
be
public
asked
delamere
oh
no
not
generally
but
friends
of
the
house
wo
be
barred
out
the
clerk
fix
it
for
you
ransom
the
head
waiter
will
be
floor
manager
delamere
was
struck
with
a
brilliant
idea
the
more
he
considered
it
the
brighter
it
seemed
another
cocktail
imparted
additional
brilliancy
to
the
conception
he
had
been
trying
after
a
feeble
fashion
to
keep
his
promise
to
clara
and
was
really
suffering
from
lack
of
excitement
he
left
the
found
the
head
waiter
held
with
him
a
short
conversation
and
left
in
his
intelligent
and
itching
palm
a
piece
of
money
the
cakewalk
was
a
great
success
the
most
brilliant
performer
was
a
late
arrival
who
made
his
appearance
just
as
the
performance
was
about
to
commence
the
newcomer
was
dressed
strikingly
the
conspicuous
features
of
his
attire
being
a
long
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
and
a
pair
of
plaid
trousers
he
was
older
too
than
the
other
participants
which
made
his
agility
the
more
remarkable
his
partner
was
a
new
chambermaid
who
had
just
come
to
town
and
whom
the
head
waiter
introduced
to
the
newcomer
upon
his
arrival
the
cake
was
awarded
to
this
couple
by
a
unanimous
vote
the
man
presented
it
to
his
partner
with
a
grandiloquent
flourish
and
returned
thanks
in
a
speech
which
sent
the
northern
visitors
into
spasms
of
delight
at
the
quaintness
of
the
darky
dialect
and
the
darky
wit
to
cap
the
climax
the
winner
danced
a
buck
dance
with
a
skill
and
agility
that
brought
a
shower
of
complimentary
silver
which
he
gathered
up
and
passed
to
the
head
waiter
ellis
was
off
duty
for
the
evening
not
having
ventured
to
put
in
an
appearance
at
carteret
since
his
last
rebuff
he
found
himself
burdened
with
a
superfluity
of
leisure
from
which
he
essayed
to
find
relief
by
dropping
into
the
hotel
office
at
about
nine
he
was
invited
up
to
see
the
cakewalk
which
he
rather
enjoyed
for
there
was
some
graceful
dancing
and
posturing
but
the
grotesque
contortions
of
one
participant
had
struck
him
as
somewhat
overdone
even
for
the
comical
type
of
negro
he
recognized
the
fellow
after
a
few
scrutiny
as
the
of
old
delamere
the
man
present
occupation
or
choice
of
diversion
seemed
out
of
keeping
with
his
employment
as
attendant
upon
an
invalid
old
gentleman
and
strangely
inconsistent
with
the
gravity
and
decorum
which
had
been
so
noticeable
when
this
agile
cakewalker
had
served
as
butler
at
major
table
upon
the
occasion
of
the
christening
dinner
there
was
a
vague
suggestion
of
unreality
about
this
performance
too
which
ellis
did
not
attempt
to
analyze
but
which
recurred
vividly
to
his
memory
upon
a
subsequent
occasion
ellis
had
never
pretended
to
that
intimate
knowledge
of
negro
thought
and
character
by
which
some
of
his
acquaintances
claimed
the
ability
to
fathom
every
motive
of
a
negro
conduct
and
predict
in
advance
what
any
one
of
the
darker
race
would
do
under
a
given
set
of
circumstances
he
would
not
have
believed
that
a
white
man
could
possess
two
so
widely
varying
phases
of
character
but
as
to
negroes
they
were
as
yet
a
crude
and
undeveloped
race
and
it
was
not
safe
to
make
predictions
concerning
them
no
one
could
tell
at
what
moment
the
thin
veneer
of
civilization
might
peel
off
and
reveal
the
underlying
savage
the
champion
cakewalker
much
to
the
surprise
of
his
sable
companions
who
were
about
equally
swayed
by
admiration
and
jealousy
disappeared
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
performance
any
one
watching
him
on
his
way
home
through
the
quiet
streets
to
old
delamere
would
have
seen
him
now
and
then
shaking
with
laughter
it
had
been
excellent
fun
nevertheless
as
he
neared
home
a
certain
aspect
of
the
affair
hitherto
unconsidered
occurred
to
him
and
it
was
in
a
rather
serious
frame
of
mind
that
he
cautiously
entered
the
house
and
sought
his
own
room
the
cakewalk
had
results
which
to
sandy
were
very
serious
the
following
week
he
was
summoned
before
the
disciplinary
committee
of
his
church
and
charged
with
unchristian
conduct
in
the
following
particulars
to
wit
dancing
and
participating
in
a
sinful
diversion
called
a
cakewalk
which
was
calculated
to
bring
the
church
into
disrepute
and
make
it
the
mockery
of
sinners
sandy
protested
his
innocence
vehemently
but
in
vain
the
proof
was
overwhelming
he
was
positively
identified
by
sister
patterson
the
hotel
cook
who
had
watched
the
whole
performance
from
the
hotel
corridor
for
the
sole
single
solitary
and
only
purpose
she
averred
of
seeing
how
far
human
wickedness
could
be
carried
by
a
professing
christian
the
whole
thing
had
been
shocking
and
offensive
to
her
and
only
a
stern
sense
of
duty
had
sustained
her
in
looking
on
that
she
might
be
qualified
to
bear
witness
against
the
offender
she
had
recognized
his
face
his
clothes
his
voice
his
walk
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
it
was
brother
sandy
this
testimony
was
confirmed
by
one
of
the
deacons
whose
son
a
waiter
at
the
hotel
had
also
seen
sandy
at
the
cakewalk
sandy
stoutly
insisted
that
he
was
at
home
the
whole
evening
that
he
had
not
been
near
the
hotel
for
three
months
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
taken
part
in
a
cakewalk
and
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
dance
it
was
replied
that
wickedness
like
everything
else
must
have
a
beginning
that
dancing
was
an
art
that
could
be
acquired
in
secret
and
came
natural
to
some
people
in
the
face
of
positive
proof
protestations
were
of
no
avail
he
was
found
guilty
and
suspended
from
church
fellowship
until
he
should
have
repented
and
made
full
confession
sturdily
refusing
to
confess
a
fault
of
which
he
claimed
to
be
innocent
sandy
remained
in
contumacy
thereby
falling
somewhat
into
disrepute
among
the
members
of
his
church
the
largest
in
the
city
the
effect
of
a
bad
reputation
being
subjective
as
well
as
objective
and
poor
human
nature
arguing
that
one
may
as
well
have
the
game
as
the
name
sandy
insensibly
glided
into
habits
of
which
the
church
would
not
have
approved
though
he
took
care
that
they
should
not
interfere
with
his
duties
to
delamere
the
consolation
thus
afforded
however
followed
as
it
was
by
remorse
of
conscience
did
not
compensate
him
for
the
loss
of
standing
in
the
church
which
to
him
was
a
social
club
as
well
as
a
religious
temple
at
times
in
conversation
with
young
delamere
he
would
lament
his
hard
fate
tom
laughed
until
he
cried
at
the
comical
idea
which
sandy
plaint
always
brought
up
of
negro
preachers
sitting
in
solemn
judgment
upon
that
cakewalk
it
had
certainly
been
a
good
cakewalk
and
sending
poor
sandy
to
spiritual
coventry
cheer
up
sandy
cheer
up
he
would
say
when
sandy
seemed
most
depressed
go
into
my
room
and
get
yourself
a
good
drink
of
liquor
the
devil
church
has
a
bigger
congregation
than
theirs
and
we
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
when
we
die
we
meet
all
our
friends
on
the
other
side
brace
up
sandy
and
be
a
man
or
if
you
ca
be
a
man
be
as
near
a
man
as
you
can
hoping
to
revive
his
drooping
spirits
sandy
too
often
accepted
the
proffered
remedy
xiv
the
maunderings
of
old
ochiltree
when
carteret
had
fully
recovered
from
the
shock
attendant
upon
the
accident
at
the
window
where
little
dodie
had
so
narrowly
escaped
death
or
serious
injury
she
ordered
her
carriage
one
afternoon
and
directed
the
coachman
to
drive
her
to
ochiltree
carteret
had
discharged
her
young
nurse
only
the
day
before
and
had
sent
for
mammy
jane
who
was
now
recovered
from
her
rheumatism
to
stay
until
she
could
find
another
girl
the
nurse
had
been
ordered
not
to
take
the
child
to
negroes
houses
yesterday
in
driving
past
the
old
homestead
of
her
husband
family
now
occupied
by
miller
and
his
family
carteret
had
seen
her
own
baby
carriage
standing
in
the
yard
when
the
nurse
returned
home
she
was
immediately
discharged
she
offered
some
sort
of
explanation
to
the
effect
that
her
sister
worked
for
miller
and
that
some
family
matter
had
rendered
it
necessary
for
her
to
see
her
sister
the
explanation
only
aggravated
the
offense
if
carteret
could
have
overlooked
the
disobedience
she
would
by
no
means
have
retained
in
her
employment
a
servant
whose
sister
worked
for
the
miller
woman
old
ochiltree
had
within
a
few
months
begun
to
show
signs
of
breaking
up
she
was
over
seventy
years
old
and
had
been
of
late
by
various
afflictions
confined
to
the
house
much
of
the
time
more
than
once
within
the
year
carteret
had
asked
her
aunt
to
come
and
live
with
her
but
ochiltree
who
would
have
regarded
such
a
step
as
an
acknowledgment
of
weakness
preferred
her
lonely
independence
she
resided
in
a
small
house
standing
back
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
on
a
quiet
street
two
old
servants
made
up
her
modest
household
this
refusal
to
live
with
her
niece
had
been
lightly
borne
for
ochiltree
was
a
woman
of
strong
individuality
whose
comments
upon
her
acquaintance
present
or
absent
were
marked
by
a
frankness
at
times
no
less
than
startling
this
characteristic
caused
her
to
be
more
or
less
avoided
ochiltree
was
aware
of
this
sentiment
on
the
part
of
her
acquaintance
and
rather
exulted
in
it
she
hated
fools
only
fools
ran
away
from
her
and
that
because
they
were
afraid
she
would
expose
their
folly
if
most
people
were
fools
it
was
no
fault
of
hers
and
she
was
not
obliged
to
indulge
them
by
pretending
to
believe
that
they
knew
anything
she
had
once
owned
considerable
property
but
was
reticent
about
her
affairs
and
told
no
one
how
much
she
was
worth
though
it
was
supposed
that
she
had
considerable
ready
money
besides
her
house
and
some
other
real
estate
carteret
was
her
nearest
living
relative
though
her
tom
delamere
had
been
a
great
favorite
with
her
if
she
did
not
spare
him
her
it
was
nevertheless
expected
in
the
family
that
she
would
leave
him
something
handsome
in
her
will
ochiltree
had
shared
in
the
general
rejoicing
upon
the
advent
of
the
carteret
baby
she
had
been
one
of
his
godmothers
and
had
hinted
at
certain
intentions
held
by
her
concerning
him
during
mammy
administration
she
had
tried
the
old
nurse
patience
more
or
less
by
her
dictatorial
interference
since
her
partial
confinement
to
the
house
she
had
gone
when
her
health
and
the
weather
would
permit
to
see
the
child
and
at
other
times
had
insisted
that
it
be
sent
to
her
in
charge
of
the
nurse
at
least
every
other
day
ochiltree
faculties
had
shared
insensibly
in
the
decline
of
her
health
this
weakness
manifested
itself
by
fits
of
in
which
she
would
seemingly
lose
connection
with
the
present
and
live
over
again
in
imagination
the
earlier
years
of
her
life
she
had
buried
two
husbands
had
tried
in
vain
to
secure
a
third
and
had
never
borne
any
children
long
ago
she
had
petrified
into
a
character
which
nothing
under
heaven
could
change
and
which
if
death
is
to
take
us
as
it
finds
us
and
the
future
life
to
keep
us
as
it
takes
us
promised
anything
but
eternal
felicity
to
those
with
whom
she
might
associate
after
this
life
tom
delamere
had
been
heard
to
say
profanely
that
if
his
aunt
polly
went
to
heaven
he
would
let
his
mansion
in
the
skies
on
a
long
lease
at
a
low
figure
when
the
carriage
drove
up
with
carteret
her
aunt
was
seated
on
the
little
front
piazza
with
her
wrinkled
hands
folded
in
her
lap
dozing
the
afternoon
away
in
fitful
slumber
tie
the
horse
william
said
carteret
and
then
go
in
and
wake
aunt
polly
and
tell
her
i
want
her
to
come
and
drive
with
me
ochiltree
had
not
observed
her
niece
approach
nor
did
she
look
up
when
william
drew
near
her
eyes
were
closed
and
she
would
let
her
head
sink
slowly
forward
recovering
it
now
and
then
with
a
spasmodic
jerk
colonel
ochiltree
she
muttered
was
shot
at
the
battle
of
culpepper
court
house
and
left
me
a
widow
for
the
second
time
but
i
would
not
have
married
any
man
on
earth
after
him
mis
ochiltree
cried
william
raising
his
voice
oh
ochiltree
if
i
had
found
a
man
a
real
man
i
might
have
married
again
i
did
not
care
for
weaklings
i
could
have
married
john
delamere
if
i
had
wanted
him
but
pshaw
i
could
have
wound
him
round
go
round
to
the
kitchen
william
interrupted
carteret
impatiently
and
tell
aunt
dinah
to
come
and
wake
her
up
william
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
a
fat
comfortable
looking
black
woman
who
curtsied
to
carteret
at
the
gate
and
then
going
up
to
her
mistress
seized
her
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
her
vigorously
wake
up
dere
mis
polly
she
screamed
as
harshly
as
her
mellow
voice
would
permit
mis
wants
you
ter
go
drivin
wid
dinah
exclaimed
the
old
lady
sitting
suddenly
upright
with
a
defiant
assumption
of
wakefulness
why
do
you
take
so
long
to
come
when
i
call
bring
me
my
bonnet
and
shawl
do
you
see
my
niece
waiting
for
me
at
the
gate
hyuh

returned
dinah
producing
the
bonnet
and
shawl
and
assisting
ochiltree
to
put
them
on
leaning
on
william
arm
the
old
lady
went
slowly
down
the
walk
and
was
handed
to
the
rear
seat
with
carteret
how
the
baby
olivia
and
why
did
you
bring
him
he
has
a
cold
and
is
a
little
hoarse
replied
carteret
so
i
thought
it
best
not
to
bring
him
out
drive
out
the
weldon
road
william
and
back
by
pine
street
the
drive
led
past
an
eminence
crowned
by
a
handsome
brick
building
of
modern
construction
evidently
an
institution
of
some
kind
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
grove
of
venerable
oaks
hugh
poindexter
ochiltree
exclaimed
explosively
after
a
considerable
silence
has
been
building
a
new
house
in
place
of
the
old
family
mansion
burned
during
the
war
it
is
poindexter

aunt
polly
that
is
the
new
colored
hospital

the
new
colored
hospital

and
the
colored
doctor
before
the
war
the
negroes
were
all
healthy
and
when
they
got
sick
we
took
care
of
them
ourselves
hugh
poindexter
has
sold
the
graves
of
his
ancestors
to
a
negro
i
should
have
starved
first
he
had
his
grandfather
grave
opened
and
there
was
nothing
to
remove
except
a
few
bits
of
from
the
coffin
all
the
rest
had
crumbled
into
dust
and
he
sold
the
dust
to
a
negro
the
world

upside
down
he
had
the
tombstone
transferred
to
the
white
cemetery
aunt

he

i
afraid
the
carriage
had
skirted
the
hill
passing
to
the
rear
of
the
new
building
turn
to
the
right
william
ordered
carteret
addressing
the
coachman
and
come
back
past
the
other
side
of
the
hospital
a
turn
to
the
right
into
another
road
soon
brought
them
to
the
front
of
the
building
which
stood
slightly
back
from
the
street
with
no
intervening
fence
or
inclosure
a
sorrel
pony
in
a
light
buggy
was
fastened
to
a
near
the
entrance
as
they
drove
past
a
lady
came
out
of
the
front
door
and
descended
the
steps
holding
by
the
hand
a
very
pretty
child
about
six
years
old
who
is
that
woman
olivia
asked
ochiltree
abruptly
with
signs
of
agitation
the
lady
coming
down
the
steps
darted
at
the
approaching
carriage
a
look
which
lingered
involuntarily
carteret
perceiving
this
glance
turned
away
coldly
with
a
sudden
hardening
of
her
own
features
the
other
woman
lifted
the
little
boy
into
the
buggy
and
drove
sharply
away
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
taken
by
carteret
carriage
who
is
that
woman
olivia
repeated
ochiltree
with
marked
emotion
i

honor
of

carteret
sharply
drive
faster
william
i

ochiltree
querulously
william
she
cried
shrilly
poking
the
coachman
in
the
back
with
the
end
of
her
cane
who

that
woman

william
exclaimed
carteret
sharply
it
that
hussy
child
said
ochiltree
turning
to
her
niece
with
great
excitement
when
your
father
died
i
turned
the
mother
and
the
child
out
into
the
street
the
mother
died
and
went
to
the
place
provided
for
such
as
she
if
i
had
been
just
in

olivia
they
would
have
turned

hush
aunt
polly
for

william
will
hear

tell
me
about
it
when
you
get
home
ochiltree
was
silent
except
for
a
few
incoherent
mumblings
what
she
might
say
what
distressing
family
secret
she
might
repeat
in
william
hearing
should
she
take
another
talkative
turn
was
beyond
conjecture
olivia
looked
anxiously
around
for
something
to
distract
her
attention
and
caught
sight
of
a
colored
man
dressed
in
sober
gray
who
was
coming
toward
the
carriage
there
delamere
sandy
exclaimed
carteret
touching
her
aunt
on
the
arm
i
wonder
how
his
master
is
sandy
oh
sandy
sandy
approached
the
carriage
lifting
his
hat
with
a
slight
exaggeration
of
chesterfieldian
elegance
sandy
no
less
than
his
master
was
a
survival
of
an
interesting
type
he
had
inherited
the
feudal
deference
for
his
superiors
in
position
joined
to
a
certain
which
saved
him
from
sycophancy
his
manners
had
been
formed
upon
those
of
old
delamere
and
were
not
a
bad
imitation
for
in
the
man
as
in
the
master
they
were
the
harmonious
reflection
of
a
mental
state
how
is
delamere
sandy
asked
carteret
acknowledging
salutation
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
he

returned
carteret
kindly

anything

him
sandy
interposed
old
ochiltree
shaking
her
head
slowly
to
emphasize
her
dissent
all
the
doctors
in
creation
could
keep
him
alive
another
year
i
shall
outlive
him
by
twenty
years
though
we
are
not

from

age
lawd
exclaimed
sandy
lifting
his
hands
in
affected
amazement
his
study
of
gentle
manners
had
been
more
than
superficial
whoever
would
dat

give
my
compliments
to
the

returned
ochiltree
with
a
simper
of
senile
vanity
though
her
back
was
weakening
under
the
strain
of
the
effort
to
sit
erect
that
she
might
maintain
this
illusion
of
comparative
youthfulness

made
another
deep
bow
and
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
until
the
carriage
had
moved
away
he
had
not
condescended
to
notice
the
coachman
at
all
who
was
one
of
the
young
negroes
of
the
new
generation
while
sandy
regarded
himself
as
belonging
to
the
quality
and
seldom
stooped
to
notice
those
beneath
him
it
would
not
have
been
becoming
in
him
either
while
conversing
with
white
ladies
to
have
noticed
a
colored
servant
moreover
the
coachman
was
a
baptist
while
sandy
was
a
methodist
though
under
a
cloud
and
considered
a
methodist
in
poor
standing
as
better
than

carteret
seeks
an
explanation
as
a
stone
dropped
into
a
pool
of
water
sets
in
motion
a
series
of
concentric
circles
which
disturb
the
whole
mass
in
varying
degree
so
ochiltree
enigmatical
remark
had
started
in
her
niece
mind
a
disturbing
train
of
thought
had
her
words
carteret
asked
herself
any
serious
meaning
or
were
they
the
mere
empty
babblings
of
a
clouded
intellect
william
she
said
to
the
coachman
when
they
reached
house
you
may
tie
the
horse
and
help
us
out
i
shall
be
here
a
little
while
william
helped
the
ladies
down
assisted
ochiltree
into
the
house
and
then
went
round
to
the
kitchen
dinah
was
an
excellent
hand
at
and
other
culinary
delicacies
dear
to
the
southern
heart
and
william
was
a
welcome
visitor
in
her
domain
now
aunt
polly
said
carteret
resolutely
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
i
want
to
know
what
you
meant
by
what
you
said
about
my
father
and
julia
and
this
this
child
of
hers
the
old
woman
smiled
cunningly
but
her
expression
soon
changed
to
one
more
grave
why
do
you
want
to
know
she
asked
suspiciously
you
got
the
land
the
houses
and
the
money
you
nothing
to
complain
of
enjoy
yourself
and
be
thankful
i
thankful
to
god
returned
olivia
for
all
his
good
gifts
and
he
has
blessed
me
abundantly
but
why
should
i
be
thankful
to
for
the
property
my
father
left
me
why
should
you
be
thankful
to
me
rejoined
ochiltree
with
querulous
indignation
you
better
ask
why
you
be
thankful
to
me
what
have
i
not
done
for
you
yes
aunt
polly
i
know
you
done
a
great
deal
you
reared
me
in
your
own
house
when
i
had
been
cast
out
of
my
father
you
have
been
a
second
mother
to
me
and
i
am
very
grateful
you
can
never
say
that
i
have
not
shown
my
gratitude
but
if
you
have
done
anything
else
for
me
i
wish
to
know
it
why
should
i
thank
you
for
my
inheritance
why
should
you
thank
me
well
because
i
drove
that
woman
and
her
brat
away
but
she
had
no
right
to
stay
aunt
polly
after
father
died
of
course
she
had
no
moral
right
before
but
it
was
his
house
and
he
could
keep
her
there
if
he
chose
but
after
his
death
she
surely
had
no
right
perhaps
not
so
surely
as
you
think
if
she
had
not
been
a
negro
had
she
been
white
there
might
have
been
a
difference
when
i
told
her
to
go
she
said
what
did
she
say
aunt
polly
demanded
olivia
eagerly
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
though
ochiltree
would
speak
no
further
but
her
once
strong
will
now
weakened
by
her
bodily
infirmities
yielded
to
the
influence
of
her
niece
imperious
demand
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
she
said
and
then
you
know
what
i
did
for
you
and
yours
ochiltree
eyes
assumed
an
introspective
expression
and
her
story
as
it
advanced
became
as
keenly
dramatic
as
though
memory
had
thrown
aside
the
veil
of
intervening
years
and
carried
her
back
directly
to
the
events
which
she
now
described
your
father
she
said
while
living
with
that
woman
left
home
one
morning
the
picture
of
health
five
minutes
later
he
tottered
into
the
house
groaning
with
pain
stricken
unto
death
by
the
hand
of
a
just
god
as
a
punishment
for
his
sins
olivia
gave
a
start
of
indignation
but
restrained
herself
i
was
at
once
informed
of
what
had
happened
for
i
had
means
of
knowing
all
that
took
place
in
the
household
old
jane
she
was
younger
then
had
come
with
you
to
my
house
but
her
daughter
remained
and
through
her
i
learned
all
that
went
on
i
hastened
immediately
to
the
house
entered
without
knocking
and
approached
merkell
bedroom
which
was
on
the
lower
floor
and
opened
into
the
hall
the
door
was
ajar
and
as
i
stood
there
for
a
moment
i
heard
your
father
voice
julia
he
was
saying
shall
not
live
until
the
doctor
comes
but
i
wish
you
to
know
dear
julia
he
called
her
julia
i
die
that
i
have
kept
my
promise
you
did
me
one
great
service
julia
you
saved
me
from
polly
ochiltree
yes
olivia
that
is
what
he
said
have
served
me
faithfully
and
well
and
i
owe
you
a
great
deal
which
i
have
tried
to
pay
merkell
dear
merkell
cried
the
hypocritical
hussy
falling
to
her
knees
by
his
bedside
and
shedding
her
crocodile
tears
owe
me
nothing
you
have
done
more
for
me
than
i
could
ever
repay
you
will
not
die
and
leave
me
no
no
it
can
not
be
i
am
going
to
die
i
am
dying
now
julia
but
listen
compose
yourself
and
listen
for
this
is
a
more
important
matter
take
the
keys
from
under
my
pillow
open
the
desk
in
the
next
room
look
in
the
second
drawer
on
the
right
and
you
will
find
an
envelope
containing
three
papers
one
of
them
is
yours
one
is
the
paper
i
promised
to
make
and
the
third
is
a
letter
which
i
wrote
last
night
as
soon
as
the
breath
has
left
my
body
deliver
the
envelope
to
the
address
indorsed
upon
it
do
not
delay
one
moment
or
you
may
live
to
regret
it
say
nothing
until
you
have
delivered
the
package
and
then
be
guided
by
the
advice
which
you
receive
it
will
come
from
a
friend
of
mine
who
will
not
see
you
wronged
i
slipped
away
from
the
door
without
making
my
presence
known
and
entered
by
a
door
from
the
hall
the
room
adjoining
the
one
where
merkell
lay
a
moment
later
there
was
a
loud
scream
returning
quickly
to
the
hall
i
entered
merkell
room
as
though
just
arrived
is
mr
merkell
i
demanded
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
is
dead
sobbed
the
woman
without
lifting
her
head
she
had
fallen
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
she
had
good
cause
to
weep
for
my
time
had
come
up
i
said
have
no
right
here
you
pollute
dead
body
by
your
touch
leave
the
house
immediately
your
day
is
over
will
not
she
cried
rising
to
her
feet
and
facing
me
with
impudence
have
a
right
to
stay
he
has
given
me
the
right
ha
i
laughed
merkell
is
dead
and
i
am
mistress
here
henceforth
go
and
go
at
once
do
you
hear
hear
but
i
shall
not
heed
i
can
prove
my
rights
i
shall
not
leave
well
i
replied
shall
see
the
law
will
decide
i
left
the
room
but
did
not
leave
the
house
on
the
contrary
i
concealed
myself
where
i
could
see
what
took
place
in
the
room
adjoining
the
she
entered
the
room
a
moment
later
with
her
child
on
one
arm
and
the
keys
in
the
other
hand
placing
the
child
on
the
floor
she
put
the
key
in
the
lock
and
seemed
surprised
to
find
the
desk
already
unfastened
she
opened
the
desk
picked
up
a
roll
of
money
and
a
ladies
watch
which
first
caught
her
eye
and
was
reaching
toward
the
drawer
upon
the
right
when
i
interrupted
her
thief
are
you
trying
to
strip
the
house
before
you
leave
it
she
gave
an
involuntary
cry
clasped
one
hand
to
her
bosom
and
with
the
other
caught
up
her
child
and
stood
like
a
wild
beast
at
bay
am
not
a
thief
she
panted
things
are
mine
lie
i
replied
have
no
right
to
them
no
more
right
than
you
have
to
remain
in
this
house
have
a
right
she
persisted
i
can
prove
it
she
turned
toward
the
desk
seized
the
drawer
and
drew
it
open
never
shall
i
forget
her
look
never
shall
i
forget
that
moment
it
was
the
happiest
of
my
life
the
drawer
was
empty
pale
as
death
she
turned
and
faced
me
papers
she
shrieked
papers
have
stolen
them
i
laughed
papers
do
you
take
me
for
a
thief
like
yourself
were
papers
here
she
cried
a
minute
since
they
are
mine
give
them
back
to
me
woman
i
said
sternly
are
lying
or
dreaming
my
papers
are
doubtless
in
his
safe
at
his
office
where
they
ought
to
be
as
for
the
rest
you
are
a
thief
am
not
she
screamed
am
his
wife
he
married
me
and
the
papers
that
were
in
the
desk
will
prove
it
i
exclaimed
when
she
had
finished
carefully
and
take
heed
to
what
i
say
you
are
a
liar
you
have
no
proofs
there
never
were
any
proofs
of
what
you
say
because
it
never
happened
it
is
absurd
upon
the
face
of
it
not
one
person
in
wellington
would
believe
it
why
should
he
marry
you
he
did
not
need
to
you
are
merely
lying
you
are
not
even
if
he
had
really
married
you
you
would
have
made
it
known
long
ago
that
you
did
not
is
proof
that
your
story
is
false
she
was
hit
so
hard
that
she
trembled
and
sank
into
a
chair
but
i
had
no
mercy
she
had
saved
your
father
from
julia
indeed
up
i
ordered
not
dare
to
sit
down
in
my
presence
i
have
you
on
the
hip
my
lady
and
will
teach
you
your
place
she
struggled
to
her
feet
and
stood
supporting
herself
with
one
hand
on
the
chair
i
could
have
killed
her
olivia
she
had
been
my
slave
if
it
had
been
before
the
war
i
would
have
had
her
whipped
to
death
are
a
thief
i
said
of
that
there
proofs
i
have
caught
you
in
the
act
the
watch
in
your
bosom
is
my
own
the
money
belongs
to
merkell
estate
which
belongs
to
my
niece
his
daughter
olivia
i
saw
you
steal
them
my
word
is
worth
yours
a
hundred
times
over
for
i
am
a
lady
and
you
are
what
and
now
hear
me
if
ever
you
breathe
to
a
living
soul
one
word
of
this
preposterous
story
i
will
charge
you
with
the
theft
and
have
you
sent
to
the
penitentiary
your
child
will
be
taken
from
you
and
you
shall
never
see
it
again
i
will
give
you
now
just
ten
minutes
to
take
your
brat
and
your
rags
out
of
this
house
forever
but
before
you
go
put
down
your
plunder
there
upon
the
desk
she
laid
down
the
money
and
the
watch
and
a
few
minutes
later
left
the
house
with
the
child
in
her
arms
and
now
olivia
you
know
how
i
saved
your
estate
and
why
you
should
be
grateful
to
me
olivia
had
listened
to
her
aunt
story
with
intense
interest
having
perceived
the
old
woman
mood
and
fearful
lest
any
interruption
might
break
the
flow
of
her
narrative
she
had
with
an
effort
kept
back
the
one
question
which
had
been
hovering
upon
her
lips
but
which
could
now
no
longer
be
withheld
what
became
of
the
papers
aunt
polly
ha
ha
chuckled
ochiltree
with
a
cunning
look
did
i
not
tell
you
that
she
found
no
papers
a
change
had
come
over
ochiltree
face
marking
the
reaction
from
her
burst
of
energy
her
eyes
were
half
closed
and
she
was
muttering
incoherently
olivia
made
some
slight
effort
to
arouse
her
but
in
vain
and
realizing
the
futility
of
any
further
attempt
to
extract
information
from
her
aunt
at
this
time
she
called
william
and
drove
homeward
xvi
ellis
takes
a
trick
late
one
afternoon
a
handsome
trap
drawn
by
two
spirited
bays
drove
up
to
carteret
gate
three
places
were
taken
by
carteret
clara
and
the
major
leaving
the
fourth
seat
vacant
i
asked
ellis
to
drive
out
with
us
said
the
major
as
he
took
the
lines
from
the
colored
man
who
had
the
trap
in
charge
we
go
by
the
office
and
pick
him
up
clara
frowned
but
perceiving
carteret
eye
fixed
upon
her
restrained
any
further
expression
of
annoyance
the
major
liking
for
ellis
had
increased
within
the
year
the
young
man
was
not
only
a
good
journalist
but
possessed
sufficient
cleverness
and
tact
to
make
him
excellent
company
the
major
was
fond
of
argument
but
extremely
tenacious
of
his
own
opinions
ellis
handled
the
foils
of
discussion
with
just
the
requisite
skill
to
draw
out
the
major
permitting
himself
to
be
vanquished
not
too
easily
but
as
it
were
inevitably
by
the
major
incontrovertible
arguments
olivia
had
long
suspected
ellis
of
feeling
a
more
than
friendly
interest
in
clara
herself
partial
to
tom
she
had
more
than
once
thought
it
hardly
fair
to
delamere
or
even
to
clara
who
was
young
and
impressionable
to
have
another
young
man
constantly
about
the
house
true
there
had
seemed
to
be
no
great
danger
for
ellis
had
neither
the
family
nor
the
means
to
make
him
a
suitable
match
for
the
sister
nor
had
clara
made
any
secret
of
her
dislike
for
ellis
or
of
her
resentment
for
his
supposed
depreciation
of
delamere
carteret
was
inclined
to
a
more
just
and
reasonable
view
of
ellis
conduct
in
this
matter
but
nevertheless
did
not
deem
it
wise
to
undeceive
clara
dislike
was
a
stout
barrier
which
remorse
might
have
broken
down
the
major
absorbed
in
schemes
of
empire
and
dreams
of
his
child
future
had
not
become
cognizant
of
the
affair
his
wife
out
of
friendship
for
tom
had
refrained
from
mentioning
it
while
the
major
with
a
delicate
regard
for
clara
feelings
had
said
nothing
at
home
in
regard
to
his
interview
with
her
lover
at
the
chronicle
office
ellis
took
the
front
seat
beside
the
major
after
leaving
the
city
pavements
they
bowled
along
merrily
over
an
excellent
built
of
oyster
shells
from
the
neighboring
sound
stopping
at
intervals
to
pay
toll
to
the
most
of
whom
were
white
women
with
tallow
complexions
and
lips
the
traditional
for
part
of
the
way
the
road
was
bordered
with
a
growth
of
scrub
oak
and
pine
interspersed
with
stretches
of
cleared
land
white
with
the
opening
cotton
or
yellow
with
ripening
corn
to
the
right
along
the
distant
were
visible
here
and
there
groups
of
turpentine
pines
though
most
of
this
growth
had
for
some
years
been
exhausted
twenty
years
before
wellington
had
been
the
world
greatest
shipping
port
for
naval
stores
but
as
the
turpentine
industry
had
moved
southward
leaving
a
trail
of
devastated
forests
in
its
rear
the
city
had
fallen
to
a
poor
fifth
or
sixth
place
in
this
trade
relying
now
almost
entirely
upon
cotton
for
its
export
business
occasionally
our
party
passed
a
person
or
a
group
of
persons
mostly
negroes
approximating
the
pure
type
for
those
of
lighter
color
grew
noticeably
scarcer
as
the
town
was
left
behind
now
and
then
one
of
these
would
salute
the
party
respectfully
while
others
glanced
at
them
indifferently
or
turned
away
there
would
have
seemed
to
a
stranger
a
lack
of
spontaneous
friendliness
between
the
people
of
these
two
races
as
though
each
felt
that
it
had
no
part
or
lot
in
the
other
life
at
one
point
the
carriage
drew
near
a
party
of
colored
folks
who
were
laughing
and
jesting
among
themselves
with
great
glee
paying
no
attention
to
the
white
people
they
continued
to
laugh
and
shout
boisterously
as
the
carriage
swept
by
major
carteret
countenance
wore
an
angry
look
the
negroes
around
this
town
are
becoming
absolutely
insufferable
he
averred
they
are
sadly
in
need
of
a
lesson
in
manners
half
an
hour
later
they
neared
another
group
who
were
also
making
merry
as
the
carriage
approached
they
became
mute
and
silent
as
the
grave
until
the
major
party
had
passed
the
negroes
are
a
sullen
race
remarked
the
major
thoughtfully
they
will
learn
their
lesson
in
a
rude
school
and
perhaps
much
sooner
than
they
dream
by
the
way
he
added
turning
to
the
ladies
what
was
the
arrangement
with
tom
was
he
to
come
out
this
evening
he
came
out
early
in
the
afternoon
replied
clara
to
go
he
is
to
join
us
at
the
hotel
after
an
hour
drive
they
reached
the
hotel
in
front
of
which
stretched
the
beach
white
and
inviting
along
the
shallow
sound
carteret
and
clara
found
seats
on
the
veranda
having
turned
the
trap
over
to
a
hostler
the
major
joined
a
group
of
gentlemen
among
whom
was
general
belmont
and
was
soon
deep
in
the
discussion
of
the
standing
problem
of
how
best
to
keep
the
negroes
down
ellis
remained
by
the
ladies
clara
seemed
restless
and
ill
at
ease
half
an
hour
elapsed
and
delamere
had
not
appeared
i
wonder
where
tom
is
said
carteret
i
guess
he
has
come
in
yet
from
fishing
said
clara
i
wish
he
would
come
it
lonesome
here
ellis
would
you
mind
looking
about
the
hotel
and
seeing
if
there
any
one
here
that
we
know
for
ellis
the
party
was
already
one
too
large
he
had
accepted
this
invitation
eagerly
hoping
to
make
friends
with
clara
during
the
evening
he
had
never
been
able
to
learn
definitely
the
reason
of
her
coldness
but
had
dated
it
from
his
meeting
with
old
ochiltree
with
which
he
felt
it
was
obscurely
connected
he
had
noticed
scowling
look
too
at
their
last
meeting
clara
injustice
whatever
its
cause
he
felt
keenly
to
delamere
scowl
he
had
paid
little
attention
he
despised
tom
so
much
that
but
for
his
engagement
to
clara
he
would
have
held
his
opinions
in
utter
contempt
he
had
even
wished
that
clara
might
make
some
charge
against
him
he
would
have
preferred
that
to
her
attitude
of
studied
indifference
the
only
redeeming
feature
about
which
was
that
it
studied
showing
that
she
at
least
had
him
in
mind
the
next
best
thing
he
reasoned
to
having
a
woman
love
you
is
to
have
her
dislike
you
violently
the
main
point
is
that
you
should
be
kept
in
mind
and
made
the
subject
of
strong
emotions
he
thought
of
the
story
of
hall
caine
where
the
woman
after
years
of
persecution
at
the
hands
of
an
unwelcome
suitor
is
on
the
point
of
yielding
out
of
sheer
irresistible
admiration
for
the
man
strength
and
persistency
when
the
lover
unaware
of
his
victory
and
despairing
of
success
seizes
her
in
his
arms
and
springing
into
the
sea
finds
a
watery
grave
for
both
the
analogy
of
this
case
with
his
own
was
of
course
not
strong
he
did
not
anticipate
any
tragedy
in
their
relations
but
he
was
glad
to
be
thought
of
upon
almost
any
terms
he
would
not
have
done
a
mean
thing
to
make
her
think
of
him
but
if
she
did
so
because
of
a
misconception
which
he
was
given
no
opportunity
to
clear
up
while
at
the
same
time
his
conscience
absolved
him
from
evil
and
gave
him
the
compensating
glow
of
martyrdom
it
was
at
least
better
than
nothing
he
would
of
course
have
preferred
to
be
upon
a
different
footing
it
had
been
a
pleasure
to
have
her
speak
to
him
during
the
drive
they
had
exchanged
a
few
trivial
remarks
in
the
general
conversation
it
was
a
greater
pleasure
to
have
her
ask
a
favor
of
him
a
pleasure
which
in
this
instance
was
partly
offset
when
he
interpreted
her
request
to
mean
that
he
was
to
look
for
tom
delamere
he
accepted
the
situation
gracefully
however
and
left
the
ladies
alone
knowing
delamere
habits
he
first
went
directly
to
the
the
atmosphere
would
be
congenial
even
if
he
were
not
drinking
delamere
was
not
there
stepping
next
into
the
office
he
asked
the
clerk
if
young
delamere
had
been
at
the
hotel
yes
sir
returned
the
man
at
the
desk
he
was
here
at
luncheon
and
then
went
out
fishing
in
a
boat
with
several
other
gentlemen
i
think
they
came
back
about
three
i
find
out
for
you
he
rang
the
bell
to
which
a
colored
boy
responded
front
said
the
clerk
see
if
young
delamere
upstairs
look
in
or
and
let
me
know
at
once
the
returned
in
a
moment
yas
suh
he
reported
with
a
suppressed
grin
he
in
suh
de
do
was
open
an
i
seed
from
de
hall
suh
i
wish
you
go
up
and
tell
him
said
ellis
that
what
are
you
grinning
about
he
asked
suddenly
noticing
the
waiter
expression
nothin
suh
nothin
at
all
suh
responded
the
negro
lapsing
into
the
stolidity
of
a
wooden
indian
what
shall
i
tell
delamere
suh
tell
him
resumed
ellis
still
watching
the
boy
suspiciously
no
tell
him
myself
he
ascended
the
broad
stair
to
the
second
floor
there
was
an
upper
balcony
and
a
parlor
with
a
piano
for
the
musically
inclined
to
reach
these
one
had
to
pass
along
the
hall
upon
which
the
room
mentioned
by
the
opened
ellis
was
quite
familiar
with
the
hotel
he
could
imagine
circumstances
under
which
he
would
not
care
to
speak
to
delamere
he
would
merely
pass
through
the
hall
and
glance
into
the
room
casually
as
any
one
else
might
do
and
see
what
the
darky
downstairs
might
have
meant
by
his
impudence
it
required
but
a
moment
to
reach
the
room
the
door
was
not
wide
open
but
far
enough
ajar
for
him
to
see
what
was
going
on
within
two
young
men
members
of
the
fast
set
at
the
clarendon
club
were
playing
cards
at
a
small
table
near
which
stood
another
decorated
with
an
array
of
empty
bottles
and
glasses
sprawling
on
a
lounge
with
flushed
face
and
disheveled
hair
his
collar
unfastened
his
vest
buttoned
awry
lay
tom
delamere
breathing
stertorously
in
what
seemed
a
drunken
sleep
lest
there
should
be
any
doubt
of
the
cause
of
his
condition
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
had
remained
clasped
mechanically
around
the
neck
of
a
bottle
which
lay
across
his
bosom
ellis
turned
away
in
disgust
and
went
slowly
back
to
the
ladies
there
seems
to
be
no
one
here
yet
he
reported
we
came
a
little
early
for
the
evening
crowd
the
clerk
says
tom
delamere
was
here
to
luncheon
but
he
has
seen
him
for
several
hours
he
not
a
very
gallant
cavalier
said
carteret
severely
he
ought
to
have
been
waiting
for
us
clara
was
clearly
disappointed
and
made
no
effort
to
conceal
her
displeasure
leaving
ellis
in
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
he
were
its
object
perhaps
she
suspected
him
of
not
having
made
a
very
thorough
search
her
next
remark
might
have
borne
such
a
construction
sister
olivia
she
said
pettishly
let
go
up
to
the
parlor
i
can
play
the
piano
anyway
if
there
no
one
to
talk
to
i
find
it
very
comfortable
here
clara
replied
her
sister
placidly
ellis
will
go
with
you
you
probably
find
some
one
in
the
parlor
or
they
come
when
you
begin
to
play
clara
expression
was
not
cordial
but
she
rose
as
if
to
go
ellis
was
in
a
quandary
if
she
went
through
the
hall
the
chances
were
at
least
even
that
she
would
see
delamere
he
did
not
care
a
rap
for
delamere
if
he
chose
to
make
a
public
exhibition
of
himself
it
was
his
own
affair
but
to
see
him
would
surely
spoil
miss
evening
and
in
her
frame
of
mind
might
lead
to
the
suspicion
that
ellis
had
prearranged
the
exposure
even
if
she
should
not
harbor
this
unjust
thought
she
would
not
love
the
witness
of
her
discomfiture
we
had
rather
not
meet
the
persons
who
have
seen
even
though
they
never
mention
the
skeletons
in
our
closets
delamere
had
disposed
of
himself
for
the
evening
ellis
would
have
a
fairer
field
with
delamere
out
of
sight
and
unaccounted
for
than
with
delamere
in
evidence
in
his
present
condition
would
you
rather
take
a
stroll
on
the
beach
miss
clara
he
asked
in
the
hope
of
creating
a
diversion
no
i
going
to
the
parlor
need
come
ellis
if
rather
go
down
to
the
beach
i
can
quite
as
well
go
alone
i
rather
go
with
you
he
said
meekly
they
were
moving
toward
the
door
opening
into
the
hall
from
which
the
broad
staircase
ascended
ellis
whose
thoughts
did
not
always
respond
quickly
to
a
sudden
emergency
was
puzzling
his
brain
as
to
how
he
should
save
her
from
any
risk
of
seeing
delamere
through
the
side
door
leading
from
the
hall
into
the
office
he
saw
the
to
whom
he
had
spoken
seated
on
the
bench
provided
for
the
servants
wo
you
wait
for
me
just
a
moment
miss
clara
while
i
step
into
the
office
i
be
with
you
in
an
instant
clara
hesitated
oh
certainly
she
replied
nonchalantly
ellis
went
direct
to
the
sit
right
where
you
are
he
said
and
do
move
a
hair
what
is
the
lady
in
the
hall
doing
she
got
her
back
this
way
suh
i
she
lookin
at
the
picture
on
the
opposite
wall
suh
all
right
whispered
ellis
pressing
a
coin
into
the
servant
hand
i
going
up
to
the
parlor
with
the
lady
you
go
up
ahead
of
us
and
keep
in
front
of
us
along
the
hall
do
dare
to
look
back
i
shall
keep
on
talking
to
the
lady
so
that
you
can
tell
by
my
voice
where
we
are
when
you
get
to
room
go
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
you
pretend
that
you
were
called
ask
the
gentlemen
what
they
want
tell
any
kind
of
a
lie
you
like
but
keep
the
door
shut
until
you
sure
we
got
by
do
you
hear
yes
suh
replied
the
negro
intelligently
the
plan
worked
without
a
hitch
ellis
talked
steadily
about
the
hotel
the
furnishings
all
sorts
of
irrelevant
subjects
to
which
miss
pemberton
paid
little
attention
she
was
angry
with
delamere
and
took
no
pains
to
conceal
her
feelings
the
entered
room
just
before
they
reached
the
door
ellis
had
heard
loud
talking
as
they
approached
and
as
they
were
passing
there
was
a
crash
of
broken
glass
as
though
some
object
had
been
thrown
at
the
door
what
is
the
matter
there
exclaimed
clara
quickening
her
footsteps
and
instinctively
drawing
closer
to
ellis
some
one
dropped
a
glass
i
presume
replied
ellis
calmly
miss
pemberton
glanced
at
him
suspiciously
she
was
in
a
decidedly
perverse
mood
seating
herself
at
the
piano
she
played
brilliantly
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
a
number
of
couples
strolled
up
to
the
parlor
but
delamere
was
not
among
them
oh
dear
exclaimed
miss
pemberton
as
she
let
her
fingers
fall
upon
the
keys
with
a
discordant
crash
after
the
last
note
i
do
see
why
we
came
out
here
let
go
back
downstairs
ellis
felt
despondent
he
had
done
his
utmost
to
serve
and
to
please
miss
pemberton
but
was
not
likely
he
foresaw
to
derive
much
benefit
from
his
opportunity
delamere
was
evidently
as
much
or
more
in
her
thoughts
by
reason
of
his
absence
than
if
he
had
been
present
if
the
door
should
have
been
opened
and
she
should
see
him
from
the
hall
upon
their
return
ellis
could
not
help
it
he
took
the
side
next
to
the
door
however
meaning
to
hurry
past
the
room
so
that
she
might
not
recognize
delamere
fortunately
the
door
was
closed
and
all
quiet
within
the
room
on
the
stairway
they
met
the
bellboy
rubbing
his
head
with
one
hand
and
holding
a
bottle
of
seltzer
upon
a
tray
in
the
other
the
boy
was
well
enough
trained
to
give
no
sign
of
recognition
though
ellis
guessed
the
destination
of
the
bottle
ellis
hardly
knew
whether
to
feel
pleased
or
disappointed
at
the
success
of
his
manoeuvres
he
had
spared
miss
pemberton
some
mortification
but
he
had
saved
tom
delamere
from
merited
exposure
clara
ought
to
know
the
truth
for
her
own
sake
on
the
beach
a
few
rods
away
fires
were
burning
around
which
several
merry
groups
had
gathered
the
smoke
went
mostly
to
one
side
but
a
slight
whiff
came
now
and
then
to
where
carteret
sat
awaiting
them
they
roasting
oysters
said
carteret
i
wish
you
bring
me
some
mr
ellis
ellis
strolled
down
to
the
beach
a
large
iron
plate
with
a
rim
like
a
great
supported
by
legs
which
held
it
off
the
ground
was
set
over
a
fire
built
upon
the
sand
this
primitive
oven
was
heaped
with
small
oysters
in
the
shell
taken
from
the
neighboring
sound
and
hauled
up
to
the
hotel
by
a
negro
whose
pony
cart
stood
near
by
a
wet
of
burlaps
was
spread
over
the
oysters
which
when
steamed
sufficiently
were
opened
by
a
colored
man
and
served
gratis
to
all
who
cared
for
them
ellis
secured
a
couple
of
plates
of
oysters
which
he
brought
to
carteret
and
clara
they
were
small
but
finely
flavored
meanwhile
delamere
who
possessed
a
remarkable
faculty
of
recuperation
from
the
effects
of
drink
had
waked
from
his
sleep
and
remembering
his
engagement
had
exerted
himself
to
overcome
the
ravages
of
the
afternoon
debauch
a
dash
of
cold
water
braced
him
up
somewhat
a
bottle
of
seltzer
and
a
big
cup
of
strong
coffee
still
further
strengthened
his
nerves
when
ellis
returned
to
the
veranda
after
having
taken
away
the
plates
delamere
had
joined
the
ladies
and
was
explaining
the
cause
of
his
absence
he
had
been
overcome
by
the
heat
he
said
while
out
fishing
and
had
been
lying
down
ever
since
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
sent
for
a
doctor
but
the
fellows
had
looked
after
him
he
had
sent
word
to
his
friends
because
he
had
wished
to
spoil
their
evening
that
was
very
considerate
of
you
tom
said
carteret
dryly
but
you
ought
to
have
let
us
know
we
have
been
worrying
about
you
very
much
clara
has
found
the
evening
dreadfully
dull

the
young
lady
cheerfully

having
a
lovely
time

and
i
have
been
up
in
the
parlor
i
played
the
piano
and
we

and
having
a
most
delightful
time
wo

the
beach

fires

tom
jealously
no

must
stir
a
foot

must
not
overtax
yourself
so
soon
it
might
do
you
serious
injury
stay
here
with
sister
olivia
she
took
ellis
arm
with
exaggerated
cordiality
delamere
glared
after
them
angrily
ellis
did
not
stop
to
question
her
motives
but
took
the
goods
the
gods
provided
with
no
very
great
apparent
effort
miss
pemberton
became
quite
friendly
and
they
strolled
along
the
beach
in
sight
of
the
hotel
for
nearly
half
an
hour
as
they
were
coming
up
she
asked
him
abruptly
ellis
did
you
know
tom
was
in
the
hotel
ellis
was
looking
across
the
sound
at
the
lights
of
a
distant
steamer
which
was
making
her
way
toward
the
harbor
i
wonder
he
said
musingly
as
though
he
had
not
heard
her
question
if
that
is
the
ocean
belle
and
was
he
really
sick
she
demanded
she
later
than
usual
this
trip
continued
ellis
pursuing
his
thought
she
was
due
about
five
miss
pemberton
under
cover
of
the
darkness
smiled
a
fine
smile
which
foreboded
ill
for
some
one
when
they
joined
the
party
on
the
piazza
the
major
had
come
up
and
was
saying
that
it
was
time
to
go
he
had
been
engaged
in
conversation
for
most
of
the
evening
with
general
belmont
and
several
other
gentlemen
here
comes
the
general
now
let
me
see
there
are
five
of
us
the
general
has
offered
me
a
seat
in
his
buggy
and
tom
can
go
with
the
general
came
up
and
spoke
to
the
ladies
tom
murmured
his
thanks
it
would
enable
him
to
make
up
a
part
of
the
delightful
evening
he
had
missed
when
carteret
had
taken
the
rear
seat
clara
promptly
took
the
place
beside
her
ellis
and
delamere
sat
in
front
when
delamere
who
had
offered
to
drive
took
the
reins
ellis
saw
that
his
hands
were
shaking
give
me
the
lines
he
whispered
your
nerves
are
unsteady
and
the
road
is
not
well
lighted
delamere
prudently
yielded
the
reins
he
did
not
like
ellis
tone
which
seemed
sneering
rather
than
expressive
of
sympathy
with
one
who
had
been
suffering
he
wondered
if
the
beggar
knew
anything
about
his
illness
clara
had
been
acting
strangely
it
would
have
been
just
like
ellis
to
have
slandered
him
the
upstart
had
no
business
with
clara
anyway
he
would
cheerfully
have
strangled
ellis
if
he
could
have
done
so
with
safety
to
himself
and
no
chance
of
discovery
the
drive
homeward
through
the
night
was
almost
a
silent
journey
carteret
was
anxious
about
her
baby
clara
did
not
speak
except
now
and
then
to
ellis
with
reference
to
some
object
in
or
near
the
road
occasionally
they
passed
a
vehicle
in
the
darkness
sometimes
barely
avoiding
a
collision
far
to
the
north
the
sky
was
lit
up
with
the
glow
of
a
forest
fire
the
breeze
from
the
sound
was
deliciously
cool
soon
the
last
was
passed
and
the
lights
of
the
town
appeared
ellis
threw
the
lines
to
william
who
was
waiting
and
hastened
to
help
the
ladies
out
ellis
said
clara
sweetly
as
she
gave
ellis
her
hand
thank
you
for
a
very
pleasant
evening
come
up
and
see
us
soon
she
ran
into
the
house
without
a
word
to
tom
xvii
the
social
aspirations
of
captain
mcbane
it
was
only
eleven
and
delamere
not
being
at
all
sleepy
and
feeling
somewhat
out
of
sorts
as
the
combined
results
of
his
debauch
and
the
snubbing
he
had
received
at
clara
hands
directed
the
major
coachman
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
trap
upon
its
arrival
to
drive
him
to
the
james
hotel
before
returning
the
horses
to
the
stable
first
however
the
coachman
left
ellis
at
his
which
was
near
by
the
two
young
men
parted
with
as
scant
courtesy
as
was
possible
without
an
open
rupture
delamere
hoped
to
find
at
the
hotel
some
form
of
distraction
to
fill
in
an
hour
or
two
before
going
home
ill
fortune
favored
him
by
placing
in
his
way
the
burly
form
of
captain
george
mcbane
who
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
alone
smoking
a
midnight
cigar
under
the
hotel
balcony
upon
delamere
making
known
his
desire
for
amusement
the
captain
proposed
a
small
game
of
poker
in
his
own
room
mcbane
had
been
waiting
for
some
such
convenient
opportunity
we
have
already
seen
that
the
captain
was
desirous
of
social
recognition
which
he
had
not
yet
obtained
beyond
the
superficial
acquaintance
acquired
by
association
with
men
about
town
he
had
determined
to
assault
society
in
its
citadel
by
seeking
membership
in
the
clarendon
club
of
which
most
gentlemen
of
the
best
families
of
the
city
were
members
the
clarendon
club
was
a
historic
institution
and
its
membership
a
social
cult
the
temple
of
which
was
located
just
off
the
main
street
of
the
city
in
a
dignified
old
colonial
mansion
which
had
housed
it
for
the
nearly
one
hundred
years
during
which
it
had
maintained
its
existence
unbroken
there
had
grown
up
around
it
many
traditions
and
special
usages
membership
in
the
clarendon
was
the
qua
of
high
social
standing
and
was
conditional
upon
two
of
three
things
birth
wealth
and
breeding
breeding
was
the
prime
essential
but
with
rare
exceptions
must
be
backed
by
either
birth
or
money
having
decided
therefore
to
seek
admission
into
this
social
arcanum
the
captain
who
had
either
not
quite
appreciated
the
standard
of
the
clarendon
membership
or
had
failed
to
see
that
he
fell
beneath
it
looked
about
for
an
intermediary
through
whom
to
approach
the
object
of
his
desire
he
had
already
thought
of
tom
delamere
in
this
connection
having
with
him
such
an
acquaintance
as
one
forms
around
a
hotel
and
having
long
ago
discovered
that
delamere
was
a
young
man
of
superficially
amiable
disposition
vicious
instincts
lax
principles
and
a
weak
will
and
which
was
quite
as
much
to
the
purpose
a
member
of
the
clarendon
club
possessing
mental
characteristics
almost
entirely
opposite
delamere
and
the
captain
had
certain
tastes
in
common
and
had
smoked
drunk
and
played
cards
together
more
than
once
still
more
to
his
purpose
mcbane
had
detected
delamere
trying
to
cheat
him
at
cards
he
had
said
nothing
about
this
discovery
but
had
merely
noted
it
as
something
which
at
some
future
time
might
prove
useful
the
captain
had
not
suffered
by
delamere
deviation
from
the
straight
line
of
honor
for
while
tom
was
as
clever
with
the
cards
as
might
be
expected
of
a
young
man
who
had
devoted
most
of
his
leisure
for
several
years
to
handling
them
mcbane
was
past
master
in
their
manipulation
during
a
stormy
career
he
had
touched
more
or
less
pitch
and
had
escaped
few
sorts
of
defilement
the
appearance
of
delamere
at
a
late
hour
unaccompanied
and
wearing
upon
his
countenance
an
expression
in
which
the
captain
read
aright
the
craving
for
mental
and
physical
excitement
gave
him
the
opportunity
for
which
he
had
been
looking
mcbane
was
not
the
man
to
lose
an
opportunity
nor
did
delamere
require
a
second
invitation
neither
was
it
necessary
during
the
progress
of
the
game
for
the
captain
to
press
upon
his
guest
the
contents
of
the
decanter
which
stood
upon
the
table
within
convenient
reach
the
captain
permitted
delamere
to
win
from
him
several
small
amounts
after
which
he
gradually
increased
the
stakes
and
turned
the
tables
delamere
with
every
instinct
of
a
gamester
was
no
more
a
match
for
mcbane
in
than
in
skill
when
the
young
man
had
lost
all
his
money
the
captain
expressed
his
entire
willingness
to
accept
notes
of
hand
for
which
he
happened
to
have
convenient
blanks
in
his
apartment
when
delamere
flushed
with
excitement
and
wine
rose
from
the
gaming
table
at
two
he
was
vaguely
conscious
that
he
owed
mcbane
a
considerable
sum
but
could
not
have
stated
how
much
his
opponent
who
was
entirely
cool
and
collected
ran
his
eye
carelessly
over
the
bits
of
paper
to
which
delamere
had
attached
his
signature
just
one
thousand
dollars
even
he
remarked
the
announcement
of
this
total
had
as
sobering
an
effect
upon
delamere
as
though
he
had
been
suddenly
deluged
with
a
shower
of
cold
water
for
a
moment
he
caught
his
breath
he
had
not
a
dollar
in
the
world
with
which
to
pay
this
sum
his
only
source
of
income
was
an
allowance
from
his
grandfather
the
monthly
installment
of
which
drawn
that
very
day
he
had
just
lost
to
mcbane
before
starting
in
upon
the
notes
of
hand
i
give
you
your
revenge
another
time
said
mcbane
as
they
rose
luck
is
against
you
and
i
unwilling
to
take
advantage
of
a
clever
young
fellow
like
you
meantime
he
added
tossing
the
notes
of
hand
carelessly
on
a
bureau
do
worry
about
these
bits
of
paper
such
small
matters
should
cut
any
figure
between
friends
but
if
you
are
around
the
hotel
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
upon
another
subject
very
well
captain
returned
tom
somewhat
ungraciously
delamere
had
been
completely
beaten
with
his
own
weapons
he
had
tried
desperately
to
cheat
mcbane
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
mcbane
had
discovered
his
efforts
and
had
cheated
him
in
turn
for
the
play
had
clearly
been
gauged
to
meet
his
own
the
biter
had
been
bit
and
could
not
complain
of
the
outcome
the
following
afternoon
mcbane
met
delamere
at
the
hotel
and
bluntly
requested
the
latter
to
propose
him
for
membership
in
the
clarendon
club
delamere
was
annoyed
at
this
request
his
aristocratic
gorge
rose
at
the
presumption
of
this
son
of
an
overseer
and
of
convicts
mcbane
was
good
enough
to
win
money
from
or
even
to
lose
money
to
but
not
good
enough
to
be
recognized
as
a
social
equal
he
would
instinctively
have
blackballed
mcbane
had
he
been
proposed
by
some
one
else
with
what
grace
could
he
put
himself
forward
as
the
sponsor
for
this
impossible
social
aspirant
moreover
it
was
clearly
a
vulgar
attempt
on
mcbane
part
to
use
his
power
over
him
for
a
personal
advantage
well
now
captain
mcbane
returned
delamere
diplomatically
never
put
any
one
up
yet
and
it
not
regarded
as
good
form
for
so
young
a
member
as
myself
to
propose
candidates
i
much
rather
ask
some
older
man
oh
well
replied
mcbane
just
as
you
say
only
i
thought
you
had
cut
your
eye
teeth
delamere
was
not
pleased
with
mcbane
tone
his
remark
was
not
acquiescent
though
couched
in
terms
of
assent
there
was
a
sneering
savagery
about
it
too
that
left
delamere
uneasy
he
was
in
a
measure
in
mcbane
power
he
could
not
pay
the
thousand
dollars
unless
it
fell
from
heaven
or
he
could
win
it
from
some
one
else
he
would
not
dare
go
to
his
grandfather
for
help
delamere
did
not
even
know
that
his
grandson
gambled
he
might
not
have
objected
perhaps
to
a
game
with
moderate
stakes
but
he
would
certainly
tom
knew
very
well
have
looked
upon
a
thousand
dollars
as
a
preposterous
sum
to
be
lost
at
cards
by
a
man
who
had
nothing
with
which
to
pay
it
it
was
part
of
delamere
creed
that
a
gentleman
should
not
make
debts
that
he
was
not
reasonably
able
to
pay
there
was
still
another
difficulty
if
he
had
lost
the
money
to
a
gentleman
and
it
had
been
his
first
serious
departure
from
delamere
perfectly
well
understood
standard
of
honor
tom
might
have
risked
a
confession
and
thrown
himself
on
his
grandfather
mercy
but
he
owed
other
sums
here
and
there
which
to
his
just
now
much
disturbed
imagination
loomed
up
in
alarming
number
and
amount
he
had
recently
observed
signs
of
coldness
too
on
the
part
of
certain
members
of
the
club
moreover
like
most
men
with
one
commanding
vice
he
was
addicted
to
several
subsidiary
forms
of
iniquity
which
in
case
of
a
scandal
were
more
than
likely
to
come
to
light
he
was
clearly
and
most
disagreeably
caught
in
the
net
of
his
own
hypocrisy
his
grandfather
believed
him
a
model
of
integrity
a
pattern
of
honor
he
could
not
afford
to
have
his
grandfather
undeceived
he
thought
of
old
ochiltree
if
she
were
a
liberal
soul
she
could
give
him
a
thousand
dollars
now
when
he
needed
it
instead
of
making
him
wait
until
she
died
which
might
not
be
for
ten
years
or
more
for
a
legacy
which
was
steadily
growing
less
and
might
be
entirely
exhausted
if
she
lived
long
enough
some
old
people
were
very
tenacious
of
life
she
was
a
careless
old
woman
too
he
reflected
and
very
foolishly
kept
her
money
in
the
house
latterly
she
had
been
growing
weak
and
childish
some
day
she
might
be
robbed
and
then
his
prospective
inheritance
from
that
source
would
vanish
into
thin
air
with
regard
to
this
debt
to
mcbane
if
he
could
not
pay
it
he
could
at
least
gain
a
long
respite
by
proposing
the
captain
at
the
club
true
he
would
undoubtedly
be
blackballed
but
before
this
inevitable
event
his
name
must
remain
posted
for
several
weeks
during
which
interval
mcbane
would
be
conciliatory
on
the
other
hand
to
propose
mcbane
would
arouse
suspicion
of
his
own
motives
it
might
reach
his
grandfather
ears
and
lead
to
a
demand
for
an
explanation
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
make
clearly
the
better
plan
would
be
to
temporize
with
mcbane
with
the
hope
that
something
might
intervene
to
remove
this
cursed
obligation
suppose
captain
he
said
affably
we
leave
the
matter
open
for
a
few
days
this
is
a
thing
that
ca
be
rushed
i
feel
the
pulse
of
my
friends
and
yours
and
when
we
get
the
lay
of
the
land
the
affair
can
be
accomplished
much
more
easily
well
that
better
returned
mcbane
somewhat
mollified
if
do
that
to
be
sure
i
will
replied
tom
easily
too
much
relieved
to
resent
if
not
too
preoccupied
to
perceive
the
implied
doubt
of
his
veracity
mcbane
ordered
and
paid
for
more
drinks
and
they
parted
on
amicable
terms
we
let
these
notes
stand
for
the
time
being
tom
said
mcbane
with
significant
emphasis
when
they
separated
delamere
winced
at
the
familiarity
he
had
reached
that
degree
of
moral
deterioration
where
while
principles
were
of
little
moment
the
externals
of
social
intercourse
possessed
an
exaggerated
importance
mcbane
had
never
before
been
so
personal
he
had
addressed
the
young
aristocrat
first
as
delamere
then
as
their
acquaintance
advanced
as
delamere
he
had
now
reached
the
abbreviated
christian
name
stage
of
familiarity
there
was
no
lower
depth
to
which
tom
could
sink
unless
mcbane
should
invent
a
nickname
by
which
to
address
him
he
did
not
like
mcbane
manner
it
was
characterized
by
a
veiled
insolence
which
was
exceedingly
offensive
he
would
go
over
to
the
club
and
try
his
luck
with
some
honest
player
perhaps
something
might
turn
up
to
relieve
him
from
his
embarrassment
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
mechanically
and
found
it
empty
in
the
present
state
of
his
credit
he
could
hardly
play
without
money
a
thought
struck
him
leaving
the
hotel
he
hastened
home
where
he
found
sandy
dusting
his
famous
suit
of
clothes
on
the
back
piazza
delamere
was
not
at
home
having
departed
for
belleview
about
two
leaving
sandy
to
follow
him
in
the
morning

sandy
returned
tom
in
a
conciliatory
tone
i
beg
your
pardon
i
been
associating
with
some
northern
white
folks
at
the
hotel
and
picked
up
the
word
from
them
you
a
colored
gentleman
sandy
the
finest
one
on
the
footstool
still
muttering
to
himself
sandy
retired
to
his
own
room
which
was
in
the
house
so
that
he
might
be
always
near
his
master
he
soon
returned
with
a
leather
and
a
cotton
sock
from
which
two
receptacles
he
painfully
extracted
a
number
of
bills
and
coins

said
as
he

added
to
himself
as
the
young
man
disappeared
down
the
street

delamere
went
directly
to
the
club
and
soon
lounged
into
the
where
several
of
the
members
were
engaged
in
play
he
sauntered
here
and
there
too
much
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
to
notice
that
the
greetings
he
received
were
less
cordial
than
those
usually
exchanged
between
the
members
of
a
small
and
select
social
club
finally
when
augustus
commonly
and
more
appropriately
called
gus
davidson
came
into
the
room
tom
stepped
toward
him
will
you
take
a
hand
in
a
game
gus
do
care
if
i
do
said
the
other
let
sit
over
here
davidson
led
the
way
to
a
table
near
the
fireplace
near
which
stood
a
tall
screen
which
at
times
occupied
various
places
in
the
room
davidson
took
the
seat
opposite
the
fireplace
leaving
delamere
with
his
back
to
the
screen
delamere
staked
half
of
sandy
money
and
lost
he
staked
the
rest
and
determined
to
win
because
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
he
had
just
reached
out
his
hand
to
gather
in
the
stakes
when
he
was
charged
with
cheating
at
cards
of
which
two
members
who
had
quietly
entered
the
room
and
posted
themselves
behind
the
screen
had
secured
specific
proof
a
meeting
of
the
membership
committee
was
hastily
summoned
it
being
an
hour
at
which
most
of
them
might
be
found
at
the
club
to
avoid
a
scandal
and
to
save
the
feelings
of
a
prominent
family
delamere
was
given
an
opportunity
to
resign
quietly
from
the
club
on
condition
that
he
paid
all
his
gambling
debts
within
three
days
and
took
an
oath
never
to
play
cards
again
for
money
this
latter
condition
was
made
at
the
suggestion
of
an
elderly
member
who
apparently
believed
that
a
man
who
would
cheat
at
cards
would
stick
at
perjury
delamere
acquiesced
very
promptly
the
taking
of
the
oath
was
easy
the
payment
of
some
fifteen
hundred
dollars
of
debts
was
a
different
matter
he
went
away
from
the
club
thoughtfully
and
it
may
be
said
in
full
justice
to
a
past
which
was
far
from
immaculate
that
in
his
present
thoughts
he
touched
a
depth
of
scoundrelism
far
beyond
anything
of
which
he
had
as
yet
deemed
himself
capable
when
a
man
of
good
position
of
whom
much
is
expected
takes
to
evil
courses
his
progress
is
apt
to
resemble
that
of
a
woman
who
has
started
on
the
downward
path
the
pace
is
all
the
swifter
because
of
the
distance
which
must
be
traversed
to
reach
the
bottom
delamere
had
made
rapid
headway
having
hitherto
played
with
sin
his
servant
had
now
become
his
master
and
held
him
in
an
iron
grip
xviii
sandy
sees
his
own
having
finished
cleaning
his
clothes
sandy
went
out
to
the
kitchen
for
supper
after
which
he
found
himself
with
nothing
to
do
absence
relieved
him
from
attendance
at
the
house
during
the
evening
he
might
have
smoked
his
pipe
tranquilly
in
the
kitchen
until
bedtime
had
not
the
cook
intimated
rather
pointedly
that
she
expected
other
company
to
a
man
of
sandy
tact
a
word
was
sufficient
and
he
resigned
himself
to
seeking
companionship
elsewhere
under
normal
circumstances
sandy
would
have
attended
on
this
particular
evening
of
the
week
but
being
still
in
contumacy
and
cherishing
what
he
considered
the
just
resentment
of
a
man
falsely
accused
he
stifled
the
inclination
which
by
long
habit
led
him
toward
the
church
and
set
out
for
the
house
of
a
friend
with
whom
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
spend
the
evening
pleasantly
unfortunately
his
friend
proved
to
be
not
at
home
so
sandy
turned
his
footsteps
toward
the
lower
part
of
the
town
where
the
streets
were
well
lighted
and
on
pleasant
evenings
quite
animated
on
the
way
he
met
josh
green
whom
he
had
known
for
many
years
though
their
paths
did
not
often
cross
in
his
loneliness
sandy
accepted
an
invitation
to
go
with
josh
and
have
a
drink
a
single
drink
when
sandy
was
going
home
about
eleven
three
sheets
in
the
wind
such
was
the
potent
effect
of
the
single
drink
and
those
which
had
followed
it
he
was
scared
almost
into
soberness
by
a
remarkable
apparition
as
it
seemed
to
sandy
he
saw
himself
hurrying
along
in
front
of
himself
toward
the
house
possibly
the
muddled
condition
of
sandy
intellect
had
so
affected
his
judgment
as
to
vitiate
any
conclusion
he
might
draw
but
sandy
was
quite
sober
enough
to
perceive
that
the
figure
ahead
of
him
wore
his
best
clothes
and
looked
exactly
like
him
but
seemed
to
be
in
something
more
of
a
hurry
a
discrepancy
which
sandy
at
once
corrected
by
quickening
his
own
pace
so
as
to
maintain
as
nearly
as
possible
an
equal
distance
between
himself
and
his
double
the
situation
was
certainly
an
incomprehensible
one
and
savored
of
the
supernatural
ef
dat
me
gwine
in
front
mused
sandy
in
vinous
perplexity
den
who
is
dis
behin

after

but
it
certainly
do
look

me
when
the
apparition
disappeared
in
the
house
by
the
side
door
sandy
stood
in
the
yard
for
several
minutes
under
the
shade
of
an
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
enter
the
house
he
took
courage
however
upon
the
reflection
that
perhaps
after
all
it
was
only
the
bad
liquor
he
had
drunk
bad
liquor
often
made
people
see
double
he
entered
the
house
it
was
dark
except
for
a
light
in
tom
room
sandy
tapped
softly
at
the
door
who
there
came
delamere
voice
in
a
somewhat
startled
tone
after
a
momentary
silence
it
me
suh
sandy
they
both
spoke
softly
it
was
the
rule
of
the
house
when
delamere
had
retired
and
though
he
was
not
at
home
habit
held
its
wonted
sway
just
a
moment
sandy
sandy
waited
patiently
in
the
hall
until
the
door
was
opened
if
the
room
showed
any
signs
of
haste
or
disorder
sandy
was
too
full
of
his
own
thoughts
and
other
things
to
notice
them
what
do
you
want
sandy
asked
tom
mistuh
tom
asked
sandy
solemnly

tom
looked
at
sandy
keenly
with
a
touch
of
apprehension
did
sandy
mean
anything
in
particular
by
this
enigmatical
inquiry
and
if
so
what
but
sandy
face
clearly
indicated
a
state
of
mind
in
which
consecutive
thought
was
improbable
and
after
a
brief
glance
delamere
breathed
more
freely
i
give
it
up
sandy
he
responded
lightly
that
too
deep
for

mistuh
tom
as
sandy
turned
to
go
delamere
was
struck
by
a
sudden
and
daring
thought
the
creature
of
impulse
he
acted
upon
it
immediately
by
the
way
sandy
he
exclaimed
carelessly
i
can
pay
you
back
that
money
you
were
good
enough
to
lend
me
this
afternoon
i
think
sleep
better
if

tom
counted
out
ten
gold
pieces
upon
the
table
at
his
elbow
and
here
another
sandy
he
said
adding
an
eleventh
as
interest

the
use
of
it
thank

tom
i
did
spec

but
i

here
added
delamere
reaching
carelessly
into
a
bureau
drawer
is
a
little
old
silk
purse
that
i
had
since
i
was
a
boy

ef

able
to

suh
sandy
whether
or
not
delamere
slept
soundly
or
was
troubled
by
dreams
pleasant
or
unpleasant
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
he
locked
his
door
and
sat
up
an
hour
later
looking
through
the
drawers
of
his
bureau
and
burning
several
articles
in
the
little
iron
stove
which
constituted
part
of
the
bedroom
furniture
it
is
also
true
that
he
rose
very
early
before
the
household
was
stirring
the
cook
slept
in
a
room
off
the
kitchen
which
was
in
an
outhouse
in
the
back
yard
she
was
just
stretching
herself
preparatory
to
getting
up
when
tom
came
to
her
window
and
said
that
he
was
going
off
fishing
to
be
gone
all
day
and
that
he
would
not
wait
for
breakfast
xix
a
midnight
walk
ellis
left
the
office
of
the
morning
chronicle
about
eleven
the
same
evening
and
set
out
to
walk
home
his
was
only
a
short
distance
beyond
old
delamere
residence
and
while
he
might
have
saved
time
and
labor
by
a
slightly
shorter
route
he
generally
selected
this
one
because
it
led
also
by
major
carteret
house
sometimes
there
would
be
a
ray
of
light
from
clara
room
which
was
on
one
of
the
front
corners
and
at
any
rate
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
gazing
at
the
outside
of
the
casket
that
enshrined
the
jewel
of
his
heart
it
was
true
that
this
purely
sentimental
pleasure
was
sometimes
dashed
with
bitterness
at
the
thought
of
his
rival
but
one
in
love
must
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
and
who
would
say
that
a
spice
of
jealousy
does
not
add
a
certain
zest
to
love
on
this
particular
evening
however
he
was
in
a
hopeful
mood
at
the
clarendon
club
where
he
had
gone
a
couple
of
hours
before
to
verify
a
certain
news
item
for
the
morning
paper
he
had
heard
a
story
about
tom
delamere
which
he
imagined
would
spike
that
gentleman
guns
for
all
time
so
far
as
miss
pemberton
was
concerned
so
grave
an
affair
as
cheating
at
cards
could
never
be
kept
secret
it
was
certain
to
reach
her
ears
and
ellis
was
morally
certain
that
clara
would
never
marry
a
man
who
had
been
proved
dishonorable
in
all
probability
there
would
be
no
great
sensation
about
the
matter
delamere
was
too
well
connected
too
many
prominent
people
would
be
involved
even
clara
and
the
editor
himself
of
whom
delamere
was
a
distant
cousin
the
reputation
of
the
club
was
also
to
be
considered
ellis
was
not
the
man
to
feel
a
malicious
delight
in
the
misfortunes
of
another
nor
was
he
a
pessimist
who
welcomed
scandal
and
disgrace
with
open
arms
as
confirming
a
gloomy
theory
of
human
life
but
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
it
was
no
more
than
human
nature
that
he
should
feel
a
certain
elation
in
the
thought
that
his
rival
had
been
practically
disposed
of
and
the
field
left
clear
especially
since
this
good
situation
had
been
brought
about
merely
by
the
unmasking
of
a
hypocrite
who
had
held
him
at
an
unfair
disadvantage
in
the
race
for
clara
favor
the
night
was
quiet
except
for
the
faint
sound
of
distant
music
now
and
then
or
the
mellow
laughter
of
some
group
of
revelers
ellis
met
but
few
pedestrians
but
as
he
neared
old
delamere
he
saw
two
men
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
his
own
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
had
observed
that
they
kept
at
about
an
equal
distance
apart
and
that
the
second
from
the
stealthy
manner
in
which
he
was
making
his
way
was
anxious
to
keep
the
first
in
sight
without
disclosing
his
own
presence
this
aroused
ellis
curiosity
which
was
satisfied
in
some
degree
when
the
man
in
advance
stopped
beneath
a
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
across
the
street
with
his
face
plainly
visible
in
the
yellow
circle
of
light
it
was
a
dark
face
and
ellis
recognized
it
instantly
as
that
of
old
delamere
body
servant
whose
personal
appearance
had
been
very
vividly
impressed
upon
ellis
at
the
christening
dinner
at
major
carteret
he
had
seen
sandy
once
since
too
at
the
hotel
cakewalk
the
negro
had
a
small
bundle
in
his
hand
the
nature
of
which
ellis
could
not
make
out
when
sandy
had
stopped
beneath
the
the
man
who
was
following
him
had
dodged
behind
a
when
sandy
moved
on
ellis
who
had
stopped
in
turn
saw
the
man
in
hiding
come
out
and
follow
sandy
when
this
second
man
came
in
range
of
the
light
ellis
wondered
that
there
should
be
two
men
so
much
alike
the
first
of
the
two
had
undoubtedly
been
sandy
ellis
had
recognized
the
peculiar
coat
that
sandy
had
worn
upon
the
two
occasions
when
he
had
noticed
him
barring
this
difference
and
the
somewhat
unsteady
gait
of
the
second
man
the
two
were
as
much
alike
as
twin
brothers
when
they
had
entered
delamere
house
one
after
the
other
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
ellis
could
perceive
that
each
of
them
tried
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
ellis
supposed
that
they
were
probably
relatives
both
employed
as
servants
or
that
some
younger
negro
taking
sandy
for
a
model
was
trying
to
pattern
himself
after
his
superior
why
all
this
mystery
of
course
he
could
not
imagine
unless
the
younger
man
had
been
out
without
permission
and
was
trying
to
avoid
the
accusing
eye
of
sandy
ellis
was
vaguely
conscious
that
he
had
seen
the
other
negro
somewhere
but
he
could
not
for
the
moment
place
him
there
were
so
many
negroes
nearly
three
negroes
to
one
white
man
in
the
city
of
wellington
the
subject
however
while
curious
was
not
important
as
compared
with
the
thoughts
of
his
sweetheart
which
drove
it
from
his
mind
clara
had
been
kind
to
him
the
night
before
whatever
her
motive
she
had
been
kind
and
could
not
consistently
return
to
her
attitude
of
coldness
with
delamere
hopelessly
discredited
ellis
hoped
to
have
at
least
fair
play
with
fair
play
he
would
take
his
chances
of
the
outcome
xx
a
shocking
crime
on
friday
morning
when
old
ochiltree
cook
dinah
went
to
wake
her
mistress
she
was
confronted
with
a
sight
that
blanched
her
ebony
cheek
and
caused
her
eyes
almost
to
start
from
her
head
with
horror
as
soon
as
she
could
command
her
trembling
limbs
sufficiently
to
make
them
carry
her
she
rushed
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
street
bareheaded
covering
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
few
blocks
that
separated
ochiltree
residence
from
that
of
her
niece
she
hastened
around
the
house
and
finding
the
back
door
open
and
the
servants
stirring
ran
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
servant
not
stopping
until
she
reached
the
door
of
carteret
chamber
at
which
she
knocked
in
great
agitation
entering
in
response
to
carteret
invitation
she
found
the
lady
dressed
in
a
simple
wrapper
superintending
the
morning
toilet
of
little
dodie
who
was
a
wakeful
child
and
insisted
upon
rising
with
the
birds
for
whose
music
he
still
showed
a
great
fondness
in
spite
of
his
narrow
escape
while
listening
to
the
mockingbird
what
is
it
dinah
asked
carteret
alarmed
at
the
frightened
face
of

what

demanded
carteret
whose
own
excitement
had
increased
with
the
length
of
this
preamble

my

my

my

carteret
was
shocked
beyond
expression
perhaps
the
spectacle
of
dinah
unrestrained
terror
aided
her
to
retain
a
greater
measure
of
than
she
might
otherwise
have
been
capable
of
giving
the
nurse
some
directions
in
regard
to
the
child
she
hastily
descended
the
stairs
and
seizing
a
hat
and
jacket
from
the
rack
in
the
hall
ran
immediately
with
dinah
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
before
the
thought
of
this
violent
death
all
her
aunt
faults
faded
into
insignificance
and
only
her
good
qualities
were
remembered
she
had
reared
olivia
she
had
stood
up
for
the
memory
of
olivia
mother
when
others
had
seemed
to
forget
what
was
due
to
it
to
her
niece
she
had
been
a
second
mother
and
had
never
been
lacking
in
affection
more
than
one
motive
however
lent
wings
to
carteret
feet
her
aunt
incomplete
disclosures
on
the
day
of
the
drive
past
the
hospital
had
been
weighing
upon
carteret
mind
and
she
had
intended
to
make
another
effort
this
very
day
to
get
an
answer
to
her
question
about
the
papers
which
the
woman
had
claimed
were
in
existence
suppose
her
aunt
had
really
found
such
papers
papers
which
would
seem
to
prove
the
preposterous
claim
made
by
her
father
mulatto
mistress
suppose
that
with
the
fatuity
which
generally
leads
human
beings
to
keep
compromising
documents
her
aunt
had
preserved
these
papers
if
they
should
be
found
there
in
the
house
there
might
be
a
scandal
if
nothing
worse
and
this
was
to
be
avoided
at
all
hazards
guided
by
some
fortunate
instinct
dinah
had
as
yet
informed
no
one
but
carteret
of
her
discovery
if
they
could
reach
the
house
before
the
murder
became
known
to
any
third
person
she
might
be
the
first
to
secure
access
to
the
remaining
contents
of
the
cedar
chest
which
would
be
likely
to
be
held
as
evidence
in
case
the
officers
of
the
law
forestalled
her
own
arrival
they
found
the
house
wrapped
in
the
silence
of
death
carteret
entered
the
chamber
of
the
dead
woman
upon
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
lay
the
body
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
strongly
marked
countenance
scarcely
more
grim
in
the
rigidity
of
death
than
it
had
been
in
life
a
gaping
wound
in
the
head
accounted
easily
for
the
death
the
cedar
chest
stood
open
its
strong
fastenings
having
been
broken
by
a
steel
bar
which
still
lay
beside
it
near
it
were
scattered
pieces
of
old
lace
antiquated
jewelry
tarnished
silverware
the
various
mute
souvenirs
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
a
long
and
active
life
kneeling
by
the
open
chest
carteret
glanced
hurriedly
through
its
contents
there
were
no
papers
there
except
a
few
old
deeds
and
letters
she
had
risen
with
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
perceived
the
end
of
a
paper
projecting
from
beneath
the
edge
of
a
rug
which
had
been
carelessly
rumpled
probably
by
the
burglar
in
his
hasty
search
for
plunder
this
paper
or
sealed
envelope
as
it
proved
to
be
which
evidently
contained
some
inclosure
she
seized
and
at
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
thrust
hastily
into
her
own
bosom
the
sight
of
two
agitated
women
rushing
through
the
quiet
streets
at
so
early
an
hour
in
the
morning
had
attracted
attention
and
aroused
curiosity
and
the
story
of
the
murder
having
once
become
known
spread
with
the
customary
rapidity
of
bad
news
very
soon
a
policeman
and
a
little
later
a
sheriff
officer
arrived
at
the
house
and
took
charge
of
the
remains
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
coroner
by
nine
a
coroner
jury
had
been
summoned
who
after
brief
deliberation
returned
a
verdict
of
willful
murder
at
the
hands
of
some
person
or
persons
unknown
while
engaged
in
the
commission
of
a
burglary
no
sooner
was
the
verdict
announced
than
the
community
or
at
least
the
white
third
of
it
resolved
itself
spontaneously
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
to
discover
the
perpetrator
of
this
dastardly
crime
which
at
this
stage
of
the
affair
seemed
merely
one
of
robbery
and
murder
suspicion
was
at
once
directed
toward
the
negroes
as
it
always
is
when
an
unexplained
crime
is
committed
in
a
southern
community
the
suspicion
was
not
entirely
an
illogical
one
having
been
for
generations
trained
up
to
thriftlessness
theft
and
immorality
against
which
only
thirty
years
of
very
limited
opportunity
can
be
offset
during
which
brief
period
they
have
been
denied
in
large
measure
the
healthful
social
stimulus
and
sympathy
which
holds
most
men
in
the
path
of
rectitude
colored
people
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
commit
at
least
a
share
of
crime
proportionate
to
their
numbers
the
population
of
the
town
was
at
least
two
thirds
colored
the
chances
were
therefore
in
the
absence
of
evidence
at
least
two
to
one
that
a
man
of
color
had
committed
the
crime
the
southern
tendency
to
charge
the
negroes
with
all
the
crime
and
immorality
of
that
region
unjust
and
exaggerated
as
the
claim
may
be
was
therefore
not
without
a
logical
basis
to
the
extent
above
indicated
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
any
logic
was
needed
or
any
reasoning
consciously
worked
out
the
mere
suggestion
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
by
a
negro
was
equivalent
to
proof
against
any
negro
that
might
be
suspected
and
could
not
prove
his
innocence
a
committee
of
white
men
was
hastily
formed
acting
independently
of
the
police
force
which
was
practically
ignored
as
likely
to
favor
the
negroes
this
committee
set
to
work
to
discover
the
murderer
the
spontaneous
activity
of
the
whites
was
accompanied
by
a
visible
shrinkage
of
the
colored
population
this
could
not
be
taken
as
any
indication
of
guilt
but
was
merely
a
recognition
of
the
palpable
fact
that
the
american
habit
of
lynching
had
so
whetted
the
thirst
for
black
blood
that
a
negro
suspected
of
crime
had
to
face
at
least
the
possibility
of
a
short
shrift
and
a
long
rope
not
to
mention
more
gruesome
horrors
without
the
intervention
of
judge
or
jury
since
to
have
a
black
face
at
such
a
time
was
to
challenge
suspicion
and
since
there
was
neither
the
martyr
glory
nor
the
saint
renown
in
being
killed
for
some
one
else
crime
and
very
little
hope
of
successful
resistance
in
case
of
an
attempt
at
lynching
it
was
obviously
the
part
of
prudence
for
those
thus
marked
to
seek
immunity
in
a
temporary
disappearance
from
public
view

mcbane
and
general
belmont
as
though
moved
by
a
common
impulse
found
themselves
at

office
of
the
morning
chronicle
carteret
was
expecting
them
though
there
had
been
no
appointment
made
these
three
resourceful
and
energetic
minds
representing
no
organized
body
and
clothed
with
no
legal
authority
had
so
completely
arrogated
to
themselves
the
leadership
of
white
public
sentiment
as
to
come
together
instinctively
when
an
event
happened
which
concerned
the
public
and
as
this
murder
presumably
did
involved
the
matter
of
race
well
gentlemen
demanded
mcbane
impatiently
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
the
scoundrel
when
we
catch
him
they
got
the
murderer
announced
a
reporter
entering
the
room
who
is
he
they
demanded
in
a
breath
a
nigger
by
the
name
of
sandy
campbell
a
servant
of
old
mr
delamere
how
did
they
catch
him
our
jerry
saw
him
last
night
going
toward
ochiltree
house
and
a
white
man
saw
him
coming
away
half
an
hour
later
has
he
confessed
no
but
he
might
as
well
when
the
posse
went
to
arrest
him
they
found
him
cleaning
the
clothes
he
had
worn
last
night
and
discovered
in
his
room
a
part
of
the
plunder
he
denies
it
strenuously
but
it
seems
a
clear
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
said
ellis
who
had
come
into
the
room
behind
the
reporter
i
saw
the
negro
last
night
at
twelve
going
into
delamere
yard
with
a
bundle
in
his
hand
he
is
the
last
negro
i
should
have
suspected
said
carteret
delamere
had
implicit
confidence
in
him
all
niggers
are
alike
remarked
mcbane
sententiously
the
only
way
to
keep
them
from
stealing
is
not
to
give
them
the
chance
a
nigger
will
steal
a
cent
off
a
dead
man
eye
he
has
assaulted
and
murdered
a
white
woman
an
example
should
be
made
of
him
carteret
recalled
very
distinctly
the
presence
of
this
negro
at
his
own
residence
on
the
occasion
of
little
theodore
christening
dinner
he
remembered
having
questioned
the
prudence
of
letting
a
servant
know
that
ochiltree
kept
money
in
the
house
delamere
had
insisted
strenuously
upon
the
honesty
of
this
particular
negro
the
whole
race
in
the
major
opinion
was
morally
undeveloped
and
only
held
within
bounds
by
the
restraining
influence
of
the
white
people
under
delamere
thumb
this
sandy
had
been
a
model
servant
faithful
docile
respectful
and
but
delamere
had
grown
old
and
had
probably
lost
in
a
measure
his
moral
influence
over
his
servant
left
to
his
own
degraded
ancestral
instincts
sandy
had
begun
to
deteriorate
and
a
rapid
decline
had
culminated
in
this
robbery
and
murder
and
who
knew
what
other
horror
the
criminal
was
a
negro
the
victim
a
white
woman
it
was
only
reasonable
to
expect
the
worst
he
swing
for
it
observed
the
general
ellis
went
into
another
room
where
his
duty
called
him
he
should
burn
for
it
averred
mcbane
i
say
burn
the
nigger
this
said
carteret
is
something
more
than
an
ordinary
crime
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
ordinary
processes
of
law
it
is
a
murderous
and
fatal
assault
upon
a
woman
of
our
race
upon
our
race
in
the
person
of
its
womanhood
its
crown
and
flower
if
such
crimes
are
not
punished
with
swift
and
terrible
directness
the
whole
white
womanhood
of
the
south
is
in
danger
burn
the
nigger
repeated
mcbane
automatically
neither
is
this
a
mere
sporadic
crime
carteret
went
on
it
is
symptomatic
it
is
the
logical
and
inevitable
result
of
the
conditions
which
have
prevailed
in
this
town
for
the
past
year
it
is
the
last
straw
burn
the
nigger
reiterated
mcbane
we
seem
to
have
the
right
nigger
but
whether
we
have
or
not
burn
nigger
it
is
an
assault
upon
the
white
race
in
the
person
of
old
ochiltree
committed
by
the
black
race
in
the
person
of
some
nigger
it
would
justify
the
white
people
in
burning
nigger
the
example
would
be
all
the
more
powerful
if
we
got
the
wrong
one
it
would
serve
notice
on
the
niggers
that
we
shall
hold
the
whole
race
responsible
for
the
misdeeds
of
each
individual
in
ancient
rome
said
the
general
when
a
master
was
killed
by
a
slave
all
his
slaves
were
put
to
the
sword
we
could
afford
that
before
the
war
said
mcbane
but
the
niggers
do
belong
to
anybody
now
and
there
nothing
to
prevent
our
doing
as
we
please
with
them
a
dead
nigger
is
no
loss
to
any
white
man
i
say
burn
the
nigger
i
do
not
believe
said
carteret
who
had
gone
to
the
window
and
was
looking
out
i
do
not
believe
that
we
need
trouble
ourselves
personally
about
his
punishment
i
should
judge
from
the
commotion
in
the
street
that
the
public
will
take
the
matter
into
its
own
hands
i
for
one
would
prefer
that
any
violence
however
justifiable
should
take
place
without
my
active
intervention
it
wo
take
place
without
mine
if
i
know
it
exclaimed
mcbane
starting
for
the
door
hold
on
a
minute
captain
exclaimed
carteret
there
more
at
stake
in
this
matter
than
the
life
of
a
black
scoundrel
wellington
is
in
the
hands
of
negroes
and
scalawags
what
better
time
to
rescue
it
it
a
trifle
premature
replied
the
general
i
should
have
preferred
to
have
this
take
place
if
it
was
to
happen
say
three
months
hence
on
the
eve
of
the
election
but
discussion
always
provokes
thirst
with
me
i
wonder
if
i
could
get
jerry
to
bring
us
some
drinks
carteret
summoned
the
porter
jerry
usual
manner
had
taken
on
an
element
of
resulting
in
what
one
might
describe
as
a
sort
of
condescending
obsequiousness
though
still
a
porter
he
was
also
a
hero
and
wore
his
aureole
jerry
said
the
general
kindly
the
white
people
are
very
much
pleased
with
the
assistance
you
have
given
them
in
apprehending
this
scoundrel
campbell
you
have
rendered
a
great
public
service
jerry
and
we
wish
you
to
know
that
it
is
appreciated
thank
y
thank
y
suh
i
alluz
tries
ter
do
my
duty
suh
stan
by
dem
dat
stan
by

suh
do
you

dere
ain
nothin
too
bad
ter

ter
no
doubt
he
will
be
punished
as
he
deserves
jerry
returned
the
general
and
we
will
see
that
you
are
suitably
rewarded
go
across
the
street
and
get
me
three
calhoun
cocktails
i
seem
to
have
nothing
less
than
a
bill
but
you
may
keep
the
change
jerry
all
the
change
jerry
was
very
happy
he
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
public
view
for
to
jerry
as
to
the
white
people
themselves
the
white
people
were
the
public
he
had
won
the
goodwill
of
the
best
people
and
had
already
begun
to
reap
a
tangible
reward
it
is
true
that
several
strange
white
men
looked
at
him
with
lowering
brows
as
he
crossed
the
street
which
was
curiously
empty
of
colored
people
but
he
nevertheless
went
firmly
forward
panoplied
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
rectitude
and
serenely
confident
of
the
protection
of
the
major
and
the
friends
jerry
is
about
the
only
negro
i
have
seen
since
nine
observed
the
general
when
the
porter
had
gone
if
this
were
election
day
where
would
the
negro
vote
be
in
hiding
where
most
of
the
negro
population
is
answered
mcbane
it
a
pity
if
old
ochiltree
had
to
go
this
way
that
it
could
have
been
deferred
a
month
or
six
weeks
carteret
frowned
at
this
remark
which
coming
from
mcbane
seemed
lacking
in
human
feeling
as
well
as
in
respect
to
his
wife
dead
relative
but
resumed
the
general
if
this
negro
is
lynched
as
he
well
deserves
to
be
it
will
not
be
without
its
effect
we
still
have
in
reserve
for
the
election
a
weapon
which
this
affair
will
only
render
more
effective
what
became
of
the
piece
in
the
negro
paper
i
have
it
here
answered
carteret
i
was
just
about
to
use
it
as
the
text
for
an
editorial
save
it
awhile
longer
responded
the
general
this
crime
itself
will
give
you
text
enough
for
a
work
when
this
conference
ended
carteret
immediately
put
into
press
an
extra
edition
of
the
morning
chronicle
which
was
soon
upon
the
streets
giving
details
of
the
crime
which
was
characterized
as
an
atrocious
assault
upon
a
defenseless
old
lady
whose
age
and
sex
would
have
protected
her
from
harm
at
the
hands
of
any
one
but
a
brute
in
the
lowest
human
form
this
event
the
chronicle
suggested
had
only
confirmed
the
opinion
which
had
been
of
late
growing
upon
the
white
people
that
drastic
efforts
were
necessary
to
protect
the
white
women
of
the
south
against
brutal
lascivious
and
murderous
assaults
at
the
hands
of
negro
men
it
was
only
another
significant
example
of
the
results
which
might
have
been
foreseen
from
the
application
of
a
false
and
pernicious
political
theory
by
which
ignorance
clothed
in
a
little
brief
authority
was
sought
to
be
exalted
over
knowledge
vice
over
virtue
an
inferior
and
degraded
race
above
the
if
an
outraged
people
justly
infuriated
and
impatient
of
the
slow
processes
of
the
courts
should
assert
their
inherent
sovereignty
which
the
law
after
all
was
merely
intended
to
embody
and
should
choose
in
obedience
to
the
higher
law
to
set
aside
temporarily
the
ordinary
judicial
procedure
it
would
serve
as
a
warning
and
an
example
to
the
vicious
elements
of
the
community
of
the
swift
and
terrible
punishment
which
would
fall
like
the
judgment
of
god
upon
any
one
who
laid
sacrilegious
hands
upon
white
womanhood
xxii
how
not
to
prevent
a
lynching
miller
who
had
sat
up
late
the
night
before
with
a
difficult
case
at
the
hospital
was
roused
about
eleven
from
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
struggling
back
into
consciousness
he
was
informed
by
his
wife
who
stood
by
his
bedside
that
watson
the
colored
lawyer
wished
to
see
him
upon
a
matter
of
great
importance
nothing
but
a
matter
of
life
and
death
would
make
me
get
up
just
now
he
said
with
a
portentous
yawn
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
replied
janet
old
polly
ochiltree
was
robbed
and
murdered
last
night
and
sandy
campbell
has
been
arrested
for
the
crime
and
they
are
going
to
lynch
him
tell
watson
to
come
right
up
exclaimed
miller
springing
out
of
bed
we
can
talk
while
i
dressing
while
miller
made
a
hasty
toilet
watson
explained
the
situation
campbell
had
been
arrested
on
the
charge
of
murder
he
had
been
seen
during
the
night
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
by
two
different
persons
a
negro
and
a
white
man
and
had
been
identified
later
while
entering
delamere
house
where
he
lived
and
where
damning
proofs
of
his
guilt
had
been
discovered
the
most
important
item
of
which
was
an
knit
silk
purse
recognized
as
ochiltree
and
several
gold
pieces
of
early
coinage
of
which
the
murdered
woman
was
known
to
have
a
number
watson
brought
with
him
one
of
the
first
copies
procurable
of
the
extra
edition
of
the
chronicle
which
contained
these
facts
and
further
information
they
were
still
talking
when
miller
knocking
at
the
door
announced
that
big
josh
green
wished
to
see
the
doctor
about
sandy
campbell
miller
took
his
collar
and
necktie
in
his
hand
and
went
downstairs
where
josh
sat
waiting
doctuh
said
green
de
folks
is
talkin
lynchin
sandy
campbell
fer
killin
ole
mis
ochiltree
he
never
done
it
an
dey
ter
be
ter
lynch
they
ought
not
to
lynch
him
even
if
he
committed
the
crime
returned
miller
but
still
less
if
he
did
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
know
he
was
wid
me
suh
las
night
at
de
time
when
dey
say
ole
ochiltree
wuz
killed
we
wuz
down
ter
sam
taylor
place
havin
a
little
game
of
kyards
an
a
little
liquor
den
we
lef
dere
an
went
up
ez
fur
ez
de
corner
er
main
an
vine
streets
where
we
an
sandy
went
home
dey
say
he
had
on
check
britches
an
a
blue
coat
when
sandy
wuz
wid
me
he
had
on
gray
clo
an
when
we
he
in
no
shape
ter
be
changin
his
clo
let
robbin
er
killin
anybody
your
testimony
ought
to
prove
an
alibi
for
him
declared
miller
dere
ain
gwine
ter
be
no
chance
ter
prove
nothin
we
kin
do
it
mighty
quick
dey
say
dey
gwine
ter
lynch
some
on
is
talkin
burnin
my
idee
is
ter
hunt
up
de
niggers
git
ter
stan
tergether
an
gyard
de
jail
why
should
we
go
to
the
principal
white
people
of
the
town
and
tell
them
josh
story
and
appeal
to
them
to
stop
this
thing
until
campbell
can
have
a
hearing
it
would
do
any
good
said
watson
despondently
their
blood
is
up
it
seems
that
some
colored
man
attacked
ochiltree
and
he
was
a
murderous
villain
whoever
he
may
be
to
quote
josh
would
destroy
the
effect
of
his
story
we
know
he
never
harmed
any
one
but
himself
an
a
few
keerliss
people
got
in
my
way
corrected
josh
he
has
been
in
court
several
times
for
fighting
and
that
against
him
to
have
been
at
sam
taylor
place
is
against
sandy
too
rather
than
in
his
favor
no
josh
the
white
people
would
believe
that
you
were
trying
to
shield
sandy
and
you
would
probably
be
arrested
as
an
accomplice
but
look
watson
miller
is
jes
got
ter
set
down
here
widout
openin
ou
mouths
an
let
dese
folks
hang
er
a
man
we
ain
guilty
dat
ai
no
law
ner
jestice
ner
nothin
ef
wo
i
do
somethin
two
niggers
ter
one
white
man
in
dis
town
an
i
sho
i
kin
fin
fifty
of
fight
ef
dey
kin
fin
anybody
ter
lead
now
hold
on
josh
argued
miller
what
is
to
be
gained
by
fighting
suppose
you
got
your
crowd
together
and
surrounded
the
jail
what
then
there
be
a
clash
declared
watson
and
instead
of
one
dead
negro
there
be
fifty
the
white
people
are
claiming
now
that
campbell
stop
with
robbery
and
murder
a
special
edition
of
the
morning
chronicle
just
out
suggests
a
further
purpose
and
has
all
the
old
shopworn
cant
about
race
purity
and
supremacy
and
imperative
necessity
which
always
comes
to
the
front
whenever
it
is
sought
to
justify
some
outrage
on
the
colored
folks
the
blood
of
the
whites
is
up
i
tell
you
is
there
anything
to
that
suggestion
asked
miller
incredulously
it
does
matter
whether
there
is
or
not
returned
watson
merely
to
suggest
it
proves
it
nothing
was
said
about
this
feature
until
the
paper
came
out
and
even
its
statement
is
vague
and
indefinite
but
now
the
claim
is
in
every
mouth
i
met
only
black
looks
as
i
came
down
the
street
white
men
with
whom
i
have
long
been
on
friendly
terms
passed
me
without
a
word
a
negro
has
been
arrested
on
suspicion
the
entire
race
is
condemned
on
general
principles
the
whole
thing
is
profoundly
discouraging
said
miller
sadly
try
as
we
may
to
build
up
the
race
in
the
essentials
of
good
citizenship
and
win
the
good
opinion
of
the
best
people
some
black
scoundrel
comes
along
and
by
a
single
criminal
act
committed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
neutralizes
the
effect
of
a
whole
year
work
it
mighty
easy
er
whatever
you
call
it
said
josh
sullenly
de
folks
don
want
too
good
an
opinion
er
de
niggers
ef
dey
had
a
good
opinion
of
dey
wouldn
have
no
excuse
f
er
an
hangin
an
burnin
but
ef
dey
ca
keep
from
doin
it
let
git
de
right
man
dis
way
er
pickin
up
de
fus
nigger
dey
comes
across
an
stringin
up
ought
ter
be
stop
an
stop
right
now
yes
that
the
worst
of
lynch
law
said
watson
but
we
are
wasting
valuable
time
it
hardly
worth
while
for
us
to
discuss
a
subject
we
are
all
agreed
upon
one
of
our
race
accused
of
certain
acts
is
about
to
be
put
to
death
without
judge
or
jury
ostensibly
because
he
committed
a
crime
really
because
he
is
a
negro
for
if
he
were
white
he
would
not
be
lynched
it
is
thus
made
a
race
issue
on
the
one
side
as
well
as
on
the
other
what
can
we
do
to
protect
him
we
kin
fight
ef
we
haf
ter
replied
josh
resolutely
well
now
let
us
see
suppose
the
colored
people
armed
themselves
messages
would
at
once
be
sent
to
every
town
and
county
in
the
neighborhood
white
men
from
all
over
the
state
armed
to
the
teeth
would
at
the
slightest
word
pour
into
town
on
every
railroad
train
and
extras
would
be
run
for
their
benefit
they
already
coming
in
said
watson
we
might
go
to
the
sheriff
suggested
miller
and
demand
that
he
telegraph
the
governor
to
call
out
the
militia
i
spoke
to
the
sheriff
an
hour
ago
replied
watson
he
has
a
white
face
and
a
whiter
liver
he
does
not
dare
call
out
the
militia
to
protect
a
negro
charged
with
such
a
brutal
crime
and
if
he
did
the
militia
are
white
men
and
who
can
say
that
their
efforts
would
not
be
directed
to
keeping
the
negroes
out
of
the
way
in
order
that
the
white
devils
might
do
their
worst
the
whole
machinery
of
the
state
is
in
the
hands
of
white
men
elected
partly
by
our
votes
when
the
color
line
is
drawn
if
they
choose
to
stand
together
with
the
rest
of
their
race
against
us
or
to
remain
passive
and
let
the
others
work
their
will
we
are
helpless
our
cause
is
hopeless
we
might
call
on
the
general
government
said
miller
surely
the
president
would
intervene
such
a
demand
would
be
of
no
avail
returned
watson
the
government
can
only
intervene
under
certain
conditions
of
which
it
must
be
informed
through
designated
channels
it
never
sees
anything
that
is
not
officially
called
to
its
attention
the
whole
negro
population
of
the
south
might
be
slaughtered
before
the
necessary
red
tape
could
be
spun
out
to
inform
the
president
that
a
state
of
anarchy
prevailed
no
hope
there
den
we
gwine
ter
do
demanded
josh
indignantly
jes
set
here
an
let
hang
sandy
er
god
knows
exclaimed
miller
the
outlook
is
dark
but
we
should
at
least
try
to
do
something
there
must
be
some
white
men
in
the
town
who
would
stand
for
law
and
order
there
no
possible
chance
for
sandy
to
escape
hanging
by
due
process
of
law
if
he
is
guilty
we
might
at
least
try
half
a
dozen
gentlemen
we
better
leave
josh
here
said
watson
he
too
truculent
if
he
went
on
the
street
he
make
trouble
and
if
he
accompanied
us
he
do
more
harm
than
good
wait
for
us
here
josh
until
we
seen
what
we
can
do
we
be
back
in
half
an
hour
in
half
an
hour
they
had
both
returned
it
no
use
reported
watson
gloomily
i
called
at
the
mayor
office
and
found
it
locked
he
is
doubtless
afraid
on
his
own
account
and
would
not
dream
of
asserting
his
authority
i
then
looked
up
judge
everton
who
has
always
seemed
to
be
fair
my
reception
was
cold
he
admitted
that
lynching
was
as
a
rule
unjustifiable
but
maintained
that
there
were
exceptions
to
all
rules
that
laws
were
made
after
all
to
express
the
will
of
the
people
in
regard
to
the
ordinary
administration
of
justice
but
that
in
an
emergency
the
sovereign
people
might
assert
itself
and
take
the
law
into
its
own
hands
the
creature
was
not
greater
than
the
creator
he
laughed
at
my
suggestion
that
sandy
was
innocent
he
is
innocent
he
said
produce
the
real
criminal
you
negroes
are
standing
in
your
own
light
when
you
try
to
protect
such
dastardly
scoundrels
as
this
campbell
who
is
an
enemy
of
society
and
not
fit
to
live
i
shall
not
move
in
the
matter
if
a
negro
wants
the
protection
of
the
law
let
him
obey
the
law
a
wise
judge
a
second
daniel
come
to
judgment
if
this
were
the
law
there
would
be
no
need
of
judges
or
juries
i
called
on
price
said
miller
my
good
friend
price
who
would
rather
lie
than
hurt
my
feelings
he
declared
is
no
affair
of
mine
or
yours
i
have
too
much
respect
for
myself
and
my
profession
to
interfere
in
such
a
matter
and
you
will
accomplish
nothing
and
only
lessen
your
own
influence
by
having
anything
to
say
the
man
may
be
innocent
i
replied
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
he
shook
his
head
pityingly
are
miller
your
prejudice
has
warped
your
judgment
the
proof
is
overwhelming
that
he
robbed
this
old
lady
laid
violent
hands
upon
her
and
left
her
dead
if
he
did
no
more
he
has
violated
the
written
and
unwritten
law
of
the
southern
states
i
could
not
save
him
if
i
would
miller
and
frankly
i
would
not
if
i
could
if
he
is
innocent
his
people
can
console
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
ochiltree
was
also
innocent
and
balance
one
crime
against
the
other
the
white
against
the
black
of
course
i
shall
take
no
part
in
whatever
may
be
done
but
it
is
not
my
affair
nor
yours
take
my
advice
miller
and
keep
out
of
it
that
is
the
situation
added
miller
summing
up
their
friendship
for
us
a
slender
stream
at
the
best
dries
up
entirely
when
it
strikes
their
prejudices
there
is
seemingly
not
one
white
man
in
wellington
who
will
speak
a
word
for
law
order
decency
or
humanity
those
who
do
not
participate
will
stand
idly
by
and
see
an
untried
man
deliberately
and
brutally
murdered
race
prejudice
is
the
devil
unchained
well
den
suh
said
josh
where
does
we
stan
now
is
we
gwine
ter
do
i
wouldn
min
fightin
fer
my
time
ai
come
yit
i
feels
dat
in
my
bones
we
gwine
ter
do
dat
i
wanter
know
what
does
old
delamere
have
to
say
about
the
matter
asked
miller
suddenly
why
have
we
thought
of
him
before
has
he
been
seen
no
replied
watson
gloomily
and
for
a
good
reason
he
is
not
in
town
i
came
by
the
house
just
now
and
learned
that
he
went
out
to
his
country
place
yesterday
afternoon
to
remain
a
week
sandy
was
to
have
followed
him
out
there
this
morning
it
a
pity
he
did
go
yesterday
the
old
gentleman
has
probably
heard
nothing
about
the
matter
how
about
young
delamere
he
went
away
early
this
morning
down
the
river
to
fish
probably
not
hear
of
it
before
night
and
he
only
a
boy
anyway
and
could
very
likely
do
nothing
said
watson
miller
looked
at
his
watch
belleview
is
ten
miles
away
he
said
it
is
now
eleven
i
can
drive
out
there
in
an
hour
and
a
half
at
the
farthest
i
go
and
see
delamere
he
can
do
more
than
any
living
man
if
he
is
able
to
do
anything
at
all
there
never
been
a
lynching
here
and
one
good
white
man
if
he
choose
may
stem
the
flood
long
enough
to
give
justice
a
chance
keep
track
of
the
white
people
while
i
gone
watson
and
you
josh
learn
what
the
colored
folks
are
saying
and
do
nothing
rash
until
i
return
in
the
meantime
do
all
that
you
can
to
find
out
who
did
commit
this
most
atrocious
murder
xxiii
belleview
miller
did
not
reach
his
destination
without
interruption
at
one
point
a
considerable
stretch
of
the
road
was
under
repair
which
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
travel
slowly
his
horse
cast
a
shoe
and
threatened
to
go
lame
but
in
the
course
of
time
he
arrived
at
the
entrance
gate
of
belleview
entering
which
he
struck
into
a
private
road
bordered
by
massive
oaks
whose
multitudinous
branches
hung
with
long
streamers
of
trailing
moss
formed
for
much
of
the
way
a
thick
canopy
above
his
head
it
took
him
only
a
few
minutes
to
traverse
the
quarter
of
a
mile
that
lay
between
the
entrance
gate
and
the
house
itself
this
old
colonial
plantation
rich
in
legendary
lore
and
replete
with
historic
distinction
had
been
in
the
delamere
family
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
along
the
bank
of
the
river
which
skirted
its
domain
the
famous
pirate
blackbeard
had
held
high
carnival
and
was
reputed
to
have
buried
much
treasure
vague
traditions
of
which
still
lingered
among
the
negroes
and
of
the
country
roundabout
the
beautiful
residence
rising
white
and
stately
in
a
grove
of
ancient
oaks
dated
from
and
was
built
of
brick
which
had
been
brought
from
england
enlarged
and
improved
from
generation
to
generation
it
stood
like
a
baronial
castle
upon
a
slight
eminence
from
which
could
be
surveyed
the
large
demesne
still
belonging
to
the
estate
which
had
shrunk
greatly
from
its
colonial
dimensions
while
still
embracing
several
thousand
acres
part
forest
and
part
cleared
land
it
had
not
of
late
years
been
profitable
in
spite
of
which
delamere
with
the
conservatism
of
his
age
and
caste
had
never
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
to
part
with
any
considerable
portion
of
it
his
grandson
he
imagined
could
make
the
estate
pay
and
yet
preserve
it
in
its
integrity
here
in
pleasant
weather
surrounded
by
the
scenes
which
he
loved
old
delamere
spent
much
of
the
time
during
his
declining
years
miller
had
once
passed
a
day
at
belleview
upon
invitation
for
this
gentleman
whose
ideals
not
even
slavery
had
been
able
to
spoil
regarded
himself
as
a
trustee
for
the
great
public
which
ought
in
his
opinion
to
take
as
much
pride
as
he
in
the
contemplation
of
this
historic
landmark
in
earlier
years
delamere
had
been
a
practicing
lawyer
and
had
numbered
miller
father
among
his
clients
he
had
always
been
regarded
as
friendly
to
the
colored
people
and
until
age
and
ill
health
had
driven
him
from
active
life
had
taken
a
lively
interest
in
their
advancement
since
the
abolition
of
slavery
upon
the
public
opening
of
miller
new
hospital
he
had
made
an
effort
to
be
present
and
had
made
a
little
speech
of
approval
and
encouragement
which
had
manifested
his
kindliness
and
given
miller
much
pleasure
it
was
with
the
consciousness
therefore
that
he
was
approaching
a
friend
as
well
as
sandy
master
that
miller
mind
was
chiefly
occupied
as
his
tired
horse
scenting
the
end
of
his
efforts
bore
him
with
a
final
burst
of
speed
along
the
last
few
rods
of
the
journey
for
the
urgency
of
miller
errand
involving
as
it
did
the
issues
of
life
and
death
did
not
permit
him
to
enjoy
the
charm
of
mossy
oak
or
forest
reaches
or
even
to
appreciate
the
noble
front
of
belleview
house
when
it
at
last
loomed
up
before
him
well
william
said
delamere
as
he
gave
his
hand
to
miller
from
the
armchair
in
which
he
was
seated
under
the
broad
and
stately
portico
i
did
expect
to
see
you
out
here
you
excuse
my
not
rising
i
none
too
firm
on
my
legs
did
you
see
anything
of
my
man
sandy
back
there
on
the
road
he
ought
to
have
been
here
by
nine
and
it
now
one
sandy
is
punctuality
itself
and
i
do
know
how
to
account
for
his
delay
clearly
there
need
be
no
time
wasted
in
preliminaries
delamere
had
gone
directly
to
the
subject
in
hand
he
will
not
be
here
sir
replied
miller
i
have
come
to
you
on
his
account
in
a
few
words
miller
stated
the
situation
preposterous
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
with
more
vigor
than
miller
had
supposed
him
to
possess
sandy
is
absolutely
incapable
of
such
a
crime
as
robbery
to
say
nothing
of
murder
and
as
for
the
rest
that
is
absurd
upon
the
face
of
it
and
so
the
poor
old
woman
is
dead
well
well
well
she
could
not
have
lived
much
longer
anyway
but
sandy
did
not
kill
her
it
simply
impossible
why
raised
that
boy
he
was
born
on
my
place
i
as
soon
believe
such
a
thing
of
my
own
grandson
as
of
sandy
no
negro
raised
by
a
delamere
would
ever
commit
such
a
crime
i
really
believe
william
that
sandy
has
the
family
honor
of
the
delameres
quite
as
much
at
heart
as
i
have
just
tell
them
i
say
sandy
is
innocent
and
it
will
be
all
right
i
afraid
sir
rejoined
miller
who
kept
his
voice
up
so
that
the
old
gentleman
could
understand
without
having
it
suggested
that
miller
knew
he
was
hard
of
hearing
that
you
do
quite
appreciate
the
situation
believe
sandy
innocent
believe
him
innocent
but
there
are
suspicious
circumstances
which
do
not
explain
themselves
and
the
white
people
of
the
city
believe
him
guilty
and
are
going
to
lynch
him
before
he
has
a
chance
to
clear
himself
why
does
he
explain
the
suspicious
circumstances
asked
delamere
sandy
is
truthful
and
can
be
believed
i
would
take
word
as
quickly
as
another
man
oath
he
has
no
chance
to
explain
said
miller
the
case
is
prejudged
a
crime
has
been
committed
sandy
is
charged
with
it
he
is
black
and
therefore
he
is
guilty
no
colored
lawyer
would
be
allowed
in
the
jail
if
one
should
dare
to
go
there
no
white
lawyer
will
intervene
be
lynched
without
judge
jury
or
preacher
unless
we
can
stave
the
thing
off
for
a
day
or
two
have
you
seen
my
grandson
asked
the
old
gentleman
is
he
not
looking
after
sandy
no
sir
it
seems
he
went
down
the
river
this
morning
to
fish
before
the
murder
was
discovered
no
one
knows
just
where
he
has
gone
or
at
what
hour
he
will
return
well
then
said
delamere
rising
from
his
chair
with
surprising
vigor
i
shall
have
to
go
myself
no
faithful
servant
of
mine
shall
be
hanged
for
a
crime
he
did
commit
so
long
as
i
have
a
voice
to
speak
or
a
dollar
to
spend
there
be
no
trouble
after
i
get
there
william
the
people
are
naturally
wrought
up
at
such
a
crime
a
fine
old
woman
she
had
some
detestable
traits
and
i
was
always
afraid
she
wanted
to
marry
me
but
she
was
of
an
excellent
family
and
had
many
good
points
an
old
woman
of
one
of
the
best
families
struck
down
by
the
hand
of
a
murderer
you
must
remember
william
that
blood
is
thicker
than
water
and
that
the
provocation
is
extreme
and
that
a
few
hotheads
might
easily
lose
sight
of
the
great
principles
involved
and
seek
immediate
vengeance
without
too
much
discrimination
but
they
are
good
people
william
and
when
i
have
spoken
and
they
have
an
opportunity
for
the
sober
second
thought
they
will
do
nothing
rashly
but
will
wait
for
the
operation
of
the
law
which
will
of
course
clear
sandy
i
sure
i
hope
so
returned
miller
shall
i
try
to
drive
you
back
sir
or
will
you
order
your
own
carriage
my
horses
are
fresher
william
and
i
have
them
brought
around
you
can
take
the
reins
if
you
will
i
rather
old
to
drive
and
my
man
will
come
behind
with
your
buggy
in
a
few
minutes
they
set
out
along
the
sandy
road
having
two
fresh
horses
they
made
better
headway
than
miller
had
made
coming
out
and
reached
wellington
easily
by
three
i
think
william
said
delamere
as
they
drove
into
the
town
that
i
had
first
better
talk
with
sandy
he
may
be
able
to
explain
away
the
things
that
seem
to
connect
him
with
this
atrocious
affair
and
that
will
put
me
in
a
better
position
to
talk
to
other
people
about
it
miller
drove
directly
to
the
county
jail
thirty
or
forty
white
men
who
seemed
to
be
casually
gathered
near
the
door
closed
up
when
the
carriage
approached
the
sheriff
who
had
seen
them
from
the
inside
came
to
the
outer
door
and
spoke
to
the
visitor
through
a
grated
wicket
wemyss
said
delamere
when
he
had
made
his
way
to
the
entrance
with
the
aid
of
his
cane
i
wish
to
see
my
servant
sandy
campbell
who
is
said
to
be
in
your
custody
the
sheriff
hesitated
meantime
there
was
some
parleying
in
low
tones
among
the
crowd
outside
no
one
interfered
however
and
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
sufficiently
to
give
entrance
to
the
old
gentleman
after
which
it
closed
quickly
and
clangorously
behind
him
feeling
no
desire
to
linger
in
the
locality
miller
having
seen
his
companion
enter
the
jail
drove
the
carriage
round
to
house
and
leaving
it
in
charge
of
a
servant
with
instructions
to
return
for
his
master
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
hastened
to
his
own
home
to
meet
watson
and
josh
and
report
the
result
of
his
efforts
xxiv
two
southern
gentlemen
the
iron
bolt
rattled
in
the
lock
the
door
of
a
cell
swung
open
and
when
delamere
had
entered
was
quickly
closed

john
an
i
got
my
reasons
fer
sayin
so
what
do
you
mean
sandy
sandy
related
his
experience
of
the
preceding
evening
how
he
had
seen
the
apparition
preceding
him
to
the
house
and
how
he
had
questioned
tom
upon
the
subject
there
some
mystery
here
sandy
said
delamere
reflectively
have
you
told
me
all
now
upon
your
honor
i
am
trying
to
save
your
life
sandy
and
i
must
be
able
to
trust
your
word
implicitly
you
must
tell
me
every
circumstance
a
very
little
and
seemingly
unimportant
bit
of
evidence
may
sometimes
determine
the
issue
of
a
great
lawsuit
there
is
one
thing
especially
sandy
where
did
you
get
the
gold
which
was
found
in
your
trunk
sandy
face
lit
up
with
hopefulness
why
mars
john
i
kin
dat
part
easy
dat
wuz
money
i
had
lent
out
an
i
got
back
f
but
no
suh
i
promise
not
ter
tell
circumstances
absolve
you
from
your
promise
sandy
your
life
is
of
more
value
to
you
than
any
other
thing
if
you
will
explain
where
you
got
the
gold
and
the
silk
purse
that
contained
it
which
is
said
to
be
ochiltree
you
will
be
back
home
before
night
old
delamere
faculties
which
had
been
waning
somewhat
in
sympathy
with
his
health
were
stirred
to
unusual
acuteness
by
his
danger
he
was
watching
sandy
with
all
the
awakened
instincts
of
the
trial
lawyer
he
could
see
clearly
enough
that
in
beginning
to
account
for
the
possession
of
the
gold
sandy
had
started
off
with
his
explanation
in
all
sincerity
at
the
mention
of
the
silk
purse
however
his
face
had
blanched
to
an
ashen
gray
and
the
words
had
frozen
upon
his
lips
a
less
discerning
observer
might
have
taken
these
things
as
signs
of
guilt
but
not
so
delamere
well
sandy
said
his
master
encouragingly
go
on
you
got
the
gold
from
sandy
remained
silent
he
had
had
a
great
shock
and
had
taken
a
great
resolution
mars
john
he
asked
dreamily
you
don
dat
i
done
dis
thing
certainly
not
sandy
else
why
should
i
be
here
an
nothin
wouldn
make
you
it
suh
no
sandy
i
could
not
believe
it
of
you
i
known
you
too
long
and
too
well
an
you
wouldn
it
not
even
ef
i
wouldn
say
one
wo
about
it
no
sandy
i
believe
you
no
more
capable
of
this
crime
than
i
would
be
or
my
grandson
tom
i
wish
tom
were
here
that
he
might
help
me
overcome
your
stubbornness
but
you
not
be
so
foolish
so
absurdly
foolish
sandy
as
to
keep
silent
and
risk
your
life
merely
to
shield
some
one
else
when
by
speaking
you
might
clear
up
this
mystery
and
be
restored
at
once
to
liberty
just
tell
me
where
you
got
the
gold

nobody
in
dis
worl
nothing
could
shake
sandy
determination
delamere
argued
expostulated
but
all
in
vain
sandy
would
not
speak
more
and
more
confident
of
some
mystery
which
would
come
out
in
time
if
properly
investigated
delamere
strangely
beset
by
a
vague
sense
of
discomfort
over
and
beyond
that
occasioned
by
his
danger
hurried
away
upon
his
errand
of
mercy
he
felt
less
confident
of
the
outcome
than
when
he
had
entered
the
jail
but
was
quite
as
much
resolved
that
no
effort
should
be
spared
to
secure
protection
for
sandy
until
there
had
been
full
opportunity
for
the
truth
to
become
known
take
good
care
of
your
prisoner
sheriff
he
said
sternly
as
he
was
conducted
to
the
door
he
will
not
be
long
in
your
custody
and
i
shall
see
that
you
are
held
strictly
accountable
for
his
safety
i
do
what
i
can
sir
replied
the
sheriff
in
an
even
tone
and
seemingly
not
greatly
impressed
by
this
warning
if
the
prisoner
is
taken
from
me
it
will
be
because
the
force
that
comes
for
him
is
too
strong
for
resistance
there
should
be
no
force
too
strong
for
an
honest
man
in
your
position
to
resist
whether
successfully
or
not
is
beyond
the
question
the
officer
who
is
intimidated
by
threats
or
by
his
own
fears
is
recreant
to
his
duty
and
no
better
than
the
mob
which
threatens
him
but
you
will
have
no
such
test
wemyss
i
shall
see
to
it
myself
that
there
is
no
violence
xxv
the
honor
of
a
family
delamere
coachman
who
in
accordance
with
instructions
left
by
miller
had
brought
the
carriage
around
to
the
jail
and
was
waiting
anxiously
at
the
nearest
corner
drove
up
with
some
trepidation
as
he
saw
his
master
emerge
from
the
prison
the
old
gentleman
entered
the
carriage
and
gave
the
order
to
be
driven
to
the
office
of
the
morning
chronicle
according
to
jerry
the
porter
whom
he
encountered
at
the
door
carteret
was
in
his
office
and
delamere
with
the
aid
of
his
servant
climbed
the
stairs
painfully
and
found
the
editor
at
his
desk
carteret
exclaimed
delamere
what
is
all
this
talk
about
lynching
my
man
for
murder
and
robbery
and
criminal
assault
perfectly
absurd
the
man
was
raised
by
me
he
has
lived
in
my
house
forty
years
he
has
been
honest
faithful
and
trustworthy
he
would
no
more
be
capable
of
this
crime
than
you
would
or
my
grandson
tom
sandy
has
too
much
respect
for
the
family
to
do
anything
that
would
reflect
disgrace
upon
it
my
dear
delamere
asked
carteret
with
an
indulgent
smile
how
could
a
negro
possibly
reflect
discredit
upon
a
white
family
i
should
really
like
to
know
how
sir
a
white
family
raised
him
like
all
the
negroes
he
has
been
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
white
people
they
are
what
we
have
made
them
or
permitted
them
to
become
we
are
not
god
delamere
we
do
not
claim
to
have
created
these
masterpieces
no
but
we
thought
to
overrule
god
laws
and
we
enslaved
these
people
for
our
greed
and
sought
to
escape
the
manstealer
curse
by
laying
to
our
souls
the
flattering
unction
that
we
were
making
of
barbarous
negroes
civilized
and
christian
men
if
we
did
not
if
instead
of
making
them
christians
we
have
made
some
of
them
brutes
we
have
only
ourselves
to
blame
and
if
these
prey
upon
society
it
is
our
just
punishment
but
my
negroes
carteret
were
well
raised
and
well
behaved
this
man
is
innocent
of
this
offense
i
solemnly
affirm
and
i
want
your
aid
to
secure
his
safety
until
a
fair
trial
can
be
had
on
your
bare
word
sir
asked
carteret
not
at
all
moved
by
this
outburst
old
delamere
trembled
with
anger
and
his
withered
cheek
flushed
darkly
but
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
answered
with
an
attempt
at
calmness
time
was
sir
when
the
word
of
a
delamere
was
held
as
good
as
his
bond
and
those
who
questioned
it
were
forced
to
maintain
their
skepticism
upon
the
field
of
honor
time
was
sir
when
the
law
was
enforced
in
this
state
in
a
manner
to
command
the
respect
of
the
world
our
lawyers
our
judges
our
courts
were
a
credit
to
humanity
and
civilization
i
fear
i
have
outlasted
my
epoch
i
have
lived
to
hear
of
white
men
the
most
favored
of
races
the
heirs
of
civilization
the
conservators
of
liberty
howling
like
red
indians
around
a
human
being
slowly
roasting
at
the
stake
my
dear
sir
said
carteret
soothingly
you
should
undeceive
yourself
this
man
is
no
longer
your
property
the
negroes
are
no
longer
under
our
control
and
with
their
emancipation
ceased
our
responsibility
their
insolence
and
disregard
for
law
have
reached
a
point
where
they
must
be
sternly
rebuked
the
law
retorted
delamere
furnishes
a
sufficient
penalty
for
any
crime
however
heinous
and
our
code
is
by
no
means
lenient
to
my
notions
death
would
seem
an
adequate
punishment
for
any
crime
and
torture
has
been
abolished
in
civilized
countries
for
a
hundred
years
it
would
be
better
to
let
a
crime
go
entirely
unpunished
than
to
use
it
as
a
pretext
for
turning
the
whole
white
population
into
a
mob
of
primitive
savages
dancing
in
hellish
glee
around
the
mangled
body
of
a
man
who
has
never
been
tried
for
a
crime
all
this
however
is
apart
from
my
errand
which
is
to
secure
your
assistance
in
heading
off
this
mob
until
sandy
can
have
a
fair
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
prove
his
innocence
how
can
i
do
that
mr
delamere
you
are
editor
of
the
morning
chronicle
the
chronicle
is
the
leading
newspaper
of
the
city
this
morning
issue
practically
suggested
the
mob
the
same
means
will
stop
it
i
will
pay
the
expense
of
an
extra
edition
calling
off
the
mob
on
the
ground
that
newly
discovered
evidence
has
shown
the
prisoner
innocence
but
where
is
the
evidence
asked
carteret
again
delamere
flushed
and
trembled
my
evidence
sir
i
say
the
negro
was
morally
incapable
of
the
crime
a
man
of
does
not
change
his
nature
he
is
no
more
capable
of
a
disgraceful
deed
than
my
grandson
would
be
carteret
smiled
sadly
i
am
sorry
delamere
he
said
that
you
should
permit
yourself
to
be
so
exercised
about
a
worthless
scoundrel
who
has
forfeited
his
right
to
live
the
proof
against
him
is
overwhelming
as
to
his
capability
of
crime
we
will
apply
your
own
test
you
have
been
kept
in
the
dark
too
long
delamere
indeed
we
all
have
about
others
as
well
as
this
negro
listen
sir
last
night
at
the
clarendon
club
tom
delamere
was
caught
cheating
outrageously
at
cards
he
had
been
suspected
for
some
time
a
trap
was
laid
for
him
and
be
fell
into
it
out
of
regard
for
you
and
for
my
family
he
has
been
permitted
to
resign
quietly
with
the
understanding
that
he
first
pay
off
his
debts
which
are
considerable
delamere
face
which
had
taken
on
some
color
in
the
excitement
of
the
interview
had
gradually
paled
to
a
chalky
white
while
carteret
was
speaking
his
head
sunk
forward
already
an
old
man
he
seemed
to
have
aged
ten
years
in
but
little
more
than
as
many
seconds
can
this
be
true
he
demanded
in
a
hoarse
whisper
is
it
entirely
authentic
true
as
gospel
true
as
it
is
that
ochiltree
has
been
murdered
and
that
this
negro
killed
her
ellis
was
at
the
club
a
few
minutes
after
the
affair
happened
and
learned
the
facts
from
one
of
the
participants
tom
made
no
attempt
at
denial
we
have
kept
the
matter
out
of
the
other
papers
and
i
would
have
spared
your
feelings
i
surely
would
not
wish
to
wound
them
but
the
temptation
proved
too
strong
for
me
and
it
seemed
the
only
way
to
convince
you
it
was
your
own
test
if
a
gentleman
of
a
distinguished
name
and
an
honorable
ancestry
with
all
the
restraining
forces
of
social
position
surrounding
him
to
hold
him
in
check
can
stoop
to
dishonor
what
is
the
improbability
of
an
illiterate
negro
being
at
least
capable
of
crime
enough
sir
said
the
old
gentleman
you
have
proved
enough
my
grandson
may
be
a
scoundrel
i
can
see
in
the
light
of
this
revelation
how
he
might
be
and
he
seems
not
to
have
denied
it
i
maintain
nevertheless
that
my
man
sandy
is
innocent
of
the
charge
against
him
he
has
denied
it
and
it
has
not
been
proved
carteret
i
owe
that
negro
my
life
he
and
his
father
before
him
have
served
me
and
mine
faithfully
and
well
i
can
not
see
him
killed
like
a
dog
without
judge
or
jury
no
not
even
if
he
were
guilty
which
i
do
not
believe
carteret
felt
a
twinge
of
remorse
for
the
pain
he
had
inflicted
upon
this
fine
old
man
this
ideal
gentleman
of
the
ideal
past
the
past
which
he
himself
so
much
admired
and
regretted
he
would
like
to
spare
his
old
friend
any
further
agitation
he
was
in
a
state
of
health
where
too
great
excitement
might
prove
fatal
but
how
could
he
the
negro
was
guilty
and
sure
to
die
sooner
or
later
he
had
not
meant
to
interfere
and
his
intervention
might
be
fruitless
delamere
he
said
gently
there
is
but
one
way
to
gain
time
you
say
the
negro
is
innocent
appearances
are
against
him
the
only
way
to
clear
him
is
to
produce
the
real
criminal
or
prove
an
alibi
if
you
or
some
other
white
man
of
equal
standing
could
swear
that
the
negro
was
in
your
presence
last
night
at
any
hour
when
this
crime
could
have
taken
place
it
might
be
barely
possible
to
prevent
the
lynching
for
the
present
and
when
he
is
tried
which
will
probably
be
not
later
than
next
week
he
will
have
every
opportunity
to
defend
himself
with
you
to
see
that
he
gets
no
less
than
justice
i
think
it
can
be
managed
though
there
is
still
a
doubt
i
will
do
my
best
for
your
sake
delamere
solely
for
your
sake
be
it
understood
and
not
for
that
of
the
negro
in
whom
you
are
entirely
deceived
i
shall
not
examine
your
motives
carteret
replied
the
other
if
you
can
bring
about
what
i
desire
whatever
is
done
added
carteret
must
be
done
quickly
it
is
now
four
no
one
can
answer
for
what
may
happen
after
seven
if
he
can
prove
an
alibi
there
may
yet
be
time
to
save
him
white
men
might
lynch
a
negro
on
suspicion
they
would
not
kill
a
man
who
was
proven
by
the
word
of
white
men
to
be
entirely
innocent
i
do
not
know
returned
delamere
shaking
his
head
sadly
after
what
you
have
told
me
it
is
no
longer
safe
to
assume
what
white
men
will
or
will
not
do
what
i
have
learned
here
has
shaken
my
faith
in
humanity
i
am
going
away
but
shall
return
in
a
short
time
shall
i
find
you
here
i
will
await
your
return
said
carteret
he
watched
delamere
pityingly
as
the
old
man
moved
away
on
the
arm
of
the
coachman
waiting
in
the
hall
he
did
not
believe
that
delamere
could
prove
an
alibi
for
his
servant
and
without
some
positive
proof
the
negro
would
surely
die
as
he
well
deserved
to
die
xxvi
the
discomfort
of
ellis
ellis
was
vaguely
uncomfortable
in
the
first
excitement
following
the
discovery
of
the
crime
he
had
given
his
bit
of
evidence
and
had
shared
the
universal
indignation
against
the
murderer
when
public
feeling
took
definite
shape
in
the
intention
to
lynch
the
prisoner
ellis
felt
a
sudden
sense
of
responsibility
growing
upon
himself
when
he
learned
an
hour
later
that
it
was
proposed
to
burn
the
negro
his
part
in
the
affair
assumed
a
still
graver
aspect
for
his
had
been
the
final
word
to
fix
the
prisoner
guilt
ellis
did
not
believe
in
lynch
law
he
had
argued
against
it
more
than
once
in
private
conversation
and
had
written
several
editorials
against
the
practice
while
in
charge
of
the
morning
chronicle
during
major
carteret
absence
a
young
man
however
and
merely
representing
another
he
had
not
set
up
as
a
reformer
taking
rather
the
view
that
this
summary
method
of
punishing
crime
with
all
its
possibilities
of
error
to
say
nothing
of
the
resulting
disrespect
of
the
law
and
contempt
for
the
methods
of
establishing
guilt
was
a
mere
temporary
symptom
of
the
unrest
caused
by
the
unsettled
relations
of
the
two
races
at
the
south
there
had
never
before
been
any
special
need
for
any
vigorous
opposition
to
lynch
law
so
far
as
the
community
was
concerned
for
there
had
not
been
a
lynching
in
wellington
since
ellis
had
come
there
eight
years
before
from
a
smaller
town
to
seek
a
place
for
himself
in
the
world
of
action
twenty
years
before
indeed
there
had
been
wild
doings
during
the
brief
outbreak
but
that
was
before
ellis
time
or
at
least
when
he
was
but
a
child
he
had
come
of
a
quaker
family
the
modified
quakers
of
the
south
and
while
sharing
in
a
general
way
the
southern
prejudice
against
the
negro
his
prejudices
had
been
tempered
by
the
peaceful
tenets
of
his
sect
his
father
had
been
a
whig
and
a
and
while
he
had
gone
with
the
south
in
the
civil
war
so
far
as
a
man
of
peace
could
go
he
had
not
done
so
for
love
of
slavery
as
the
day
wore
on
ellis
personal
responsibility
for
the
intended
bore
more
heavily
upon
him
suppose
he
had
been
wrong
he
had
seen
the
accused
negro
he
had
recognized
him
by
his
clothes
his
whiskers
his
spectacles
and
his
walk
but
he
had
also
seen
another
man
who
resembled
sandy
so
closely
that
but
for
the
difference
in
their
clothes
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
he
could
not
have
told
them
apart
had
he
not
seen
the
first
man
he
would
have
sworn
with
even
greater
confidence
that
the
second
was
sandy
there
had
been
he
recalled
about
one
of
the
men
he
had
not
been
then
nor
was
he
now
able
to
tell
which
something
vaguely
familiar
and
yet
seemingly
discordant
to
whichever
of
the
two
it
was
or
as
it
seemed
to
him
now
to
any
man
of
that
race
his
mind
reverted
to
the
place
where
he
had
last
seen
sandy
and
then
a
sudden
wave
of
illumination
swept
over
him
and
filled
him
with
a
thrill
of
horror
the
cakewalk
the
dancing
the
speech
they
were
not
sandy
at
all
nor
any
negro
it
was
a
white
man
who
had
stood
in
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
so
that
the
casual
might
see
and
recognize
in
him
old
delamere
servant
the
scheme
was
a
dastardly
one
and
worthy
of
a
heart
that
was
something
worse
than
weak
and
vicious
ellis
resolved
that
the
negro
should
not
if
he
could
prevent
it
die
for
another
crime
but
what
proof
had
he
himself
to
offer
in
support
of
his
theory
then
again
if
he
denounced
tom
delamere
as
the
murderer
it
would
involve
in
all
probability
the
destruction
of
his
own
hopes
with
regard
to
clara
of
course
she
could
not
marry
delamere
after
the
disclosure
the
disgraceful
episode
at
the
club
would
have
been
enough
to
make
that
reasonably
certain
it
had
put
a
nail
in
delamere
coffin
but
this
crime
had
driven
it
in
to
the
head
and
clinched
it
on
the
other
hand
would
miss
pemberton
ever
speak
again
to
the
man
who
had
been
the
instrument
of
bringing
disgrace
upon
the
family
spies
detectives
police
officers
may
be
useful
citizens
but
they
are
rarely
pleasant
company
for
other
people
we
fee
the
executioner
but
we
do
not
touch
his
bloody
hand
we
might
feel
a
certain
tragic
admiration
for
brutus
condemning
his
sons
to
death
but
we
would
scarcely
invite
brutus
to
dinner
after
the
event
it
would
harrow
our
feelings
too
much
perhaps
thought
ellis
there
might
be
a
way
out
of
the
dilemma
it
might
be
possible
to
save
this
innocent
negro
without
for
the
time
being
involving
delamere
he
believed
that
murder
will
out
but
it
need
not
be
through
his
initiative
he
determined
to
go
to
the
jail
and
interview
the
prisoner
who
might
give
such
an
account
of
himself
as
would
establish
his
innocence
beyond
a
doubt
if
so
ellis
would
exert
himself
to
stem
the
tide
of
popular
fury
if
as
a
last
resort
he
could
save
sandy
only
by
denouncing
delamere
he
would
do
his
duty
let
it
cost
him
what
it
might
the
gravity
of
his
errand
was
not
lessened
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
on
the
way
to
the
jail
the
anger
of
the
people
was
at
a
white
heat
a
white
woman
had
been
assaulted
and
murdered
by
a
brutal
negro
neither
advanced
age
nor
high
social
standing
had
been
able
to
protect
her
from
the
ferocity
of
a
black
savage
her
sex
which
should
have
been
her
shield
and
buckler
had
made
her
an
easy
mark
for
the
villainy
of
a
black
brute
to
take
the
time
to
try
him
would
be
a
criminal
waste
of
public
money
to
hang
him
would
be
too
slight
a
punishment
for
so
dastardly
a
crime
an
example
must
be
made
already
the
preparations
were
under
way
for
the
impending
execution
a
from
the
railroad
yard
had
been
procured
and
men
were
burying
it
in
the
square
before
the
jail
others
were
bringing
chains
and
a
load
of
pine
wood
was
piled
in
convenient
proximity
some
enterprising
individual
had
begun
the
erection
of
seats
from
which
for
a
pecuniary
consideration
the
spectacle
might
be
the
more
easily
and
comfortably
viewed
ellis
was
stopped
once
or
twice
by
persons
of
his
acquaintance
from
one
he
learned
that
the
railroads
would
run
excursions
from
the
neighboring
towns
in
order
to
bring
spectators
to
the
scene
from
another
that
the
burning
was
to
take
place
early
in
the
evening
so
that
the
children
might
not
be
kept
up
beyond
their
usual
bedtime
in
one
group
that
he
passed
he
heard
several
young
men
discussing
the
question
of
which
portions
of
the
negro
body
they
would
prefer
for
souvenirs
ellis
shuddered
and
hastened
forward
whatever
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
quickly
or
it
would
be
too
late
he
saw
that
already
it
would
require
a
strong
case
in
favor
of
the
accused
to
overcome
the
popular
verdict
going
up
the
steps
of
the
jail
he
met
delamere
who
was
just
coming
out
after
a
fruitless
interview
with
sandy
ellis
said
the
old
gentleman
who
seemed
greatly
agitated
this
is
monstrous
it
is
indeed
sir
returned
the
younger
man
i
mean
to
stop
it
if
i
can
the
negro
did
not
kill
mrs
ochiltree
delamere
looked
at
ellis
keenly
and
as
ellis
recalled
afterwards
there
was
death
in
his
eyes
unable
to
draw
a
syllable
from
sandy
he
had
found
his
servant
silence
more
eloquent
than
words
ellis
felt
a
presentiment
that
this
affair
however
it
might
terminate
would
be
fatal
to
this
fine
old
man
whom
the
city
could
ill
spare
in
spite
of
his
age
and
infirmities
ellis
asked
delamere
in
a
voice
which
trembled
with
emotion
do
you
know
who
killed
her
ellis
felt
a
surging
pity
for
his
old
friend
but
every
step
that
he
had
taken
toward
the
jail
had
confirmed
and
strengthened
his
own
resolution
that
this
contemplated
crime
which
he
dimly
felt
to
be
far
more
atrocious
than
that
of
which
sandy
was
accused
in
that
it
involved
a
whole
community
rather
than
one
vicious
man
should
be
stopped
at
any
cost
deplorable
enough
had
the
negro
been
guilty
it
became
in
view
of
his
certain
innocence
an
unspeakable
horror
which
for
all
time
would
cover
the
city
with
infamy
delamere
he
replied
looking
the
elder
man
squarely
in
the
eyes
i
think
i
do
and
i
am
very
sorry
and
who
was
it
mr
ellis
he
put
the
question
hopelessly
as
though
the
answer
were
a
foregone
conclusion
i
do
not
wish
to
say
at
present
replied
ellis
with
a
remorseful
pang
unless
it
becomes
absolutely
necessary
to
save
the
negro
life
accusations
are
dangerous
as
this
case
proves
unless
the
proof
be
certain
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
delamere
would
collapse
upon
the
spot
rallying
almost
instantly
however
he
took
the
arm
which
ellis
involuntarily
offered
and
said
with
an
effort
ellis
you
are
a
gentleman
whom
it
is
an
honor
to
know
if
you
have
time
i
wish
you
would
go
with
me
to
my
house
i
can
hardly
trust
myself
alone
and
thence
to
the
chronicle
office
this
thing
shall
be
stopped
and
you
will
help
me
stop
it
it
required
but
a
few
minutes
to
cover
the
half
mile
that
lay
between
the
prison
and
delamere
residence
xxvii
the
vagaries
of
the
higher
law
delamere
went
immediately
to
his
grandson
room
which
he
entered
alone
closing
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
he
had
requested
ellis
to
wait
in
the
carriage
the
bed
had
been
made
and
the
room
was
apparently
in
perfect
order
there
was
a
bureau
in
the
room
through
which
delamere
proceeded
to
look
thoroughly
finding
one
of
the
drawers
locked
he
tried
it
with
a
key
of
his
own
and
being
unable
to
unlock
it
took
a
poker
from
beside
the
stove
and
broke
it
ruthlessly
open
the
contents
served
to
confirm
what
he
had
heard
concerning
his
grandson
character
thrown
together
in
disorderly
confusion
were
bottles
of
wine
and
whiskey
soiled
packs
of
cards
a
with
dice
a
box
of
poker
chips
several
revolvers
and
a
number
of
photographs
and
books
at
which
the
old
gentleman
merely
glanced
to
ascertain
their
nature
so
far
while
his
suspicion
had
been
strengthened
he
had
found
nothing
to
confirm
it
he
searched
the
room
more
carefully
and
found
in
the
by
the
small
which
stood
in
the
room
a
torn
and
crumpled
bit
of
paper
stooping
to
pick
this
up
his
eye
caught
a
gleam
of
something
yellow
beneath
the
bureau
which
lay
directly
in
his
line
of
vision
first
he
smoothed
out
the
paper
it
was
apparently
the
lower
half
of
a
label
or
part
of
the
cover
of
a
small
box
torn
diagonally
from
corner
to
corner
from
the
business
card
at
the
bottom
which
gave
the
name
of
a
firm
of
manufacturers
of
theatrical
supplies
in
a
northern
city
and
from
the
letters
remaining
upon
the
upper
and
narrower
half
the
bit
of
paper
had
plainly
formed
part
of
the
wrapper
of
a
package
of
burnt
cork
closing
his
fingers
spasmodically
over
this
damning
piece
of
evidence
delamere
knelt
painfully
and
with
the
aid
of
his
cane
drew
out
from
under
the
bureau
the
yellow
object
which
had
attracted
his
attention
it
was
a
gold
piece
of
a
date
back
toward
the
beginning
of
the
century
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
delamere
summoned
the
cook
from
the
kitchen
in
the
back
yard
in
answer
to
her
master
questions
sally
averred
that
tom
had
got
up
very
early
had
knocked
at
her
window
she
slept
in
a
room
off
the
kitchen
in
the
yard
and
had
told
her
that
she
need
not
bother
about
breakfast
for
him
as
he
had
had
a
cold
bite
from
the
pantry
that
he
was
going
hunting
and
fishing
and
would
be
gone
all
day
according
to
sally
tom
had
come
in
about
ten
the
night
before
he
had
forgotten
his
sandy
was
out
and
she
had
admitted
him
with
her
own
key
he
had
said
that
he
was
very
tired
and
was
going
immediately
to
bed

perplexed

he
never
got
up
so
thank
you
sally
said
delamere
when
the
woman
had
finished
that
will
do
will
you
be
home
ter
suppah
suh
asked
the
cook
yes
it
was
a
matter
of
the
supremest
indifference
to
delamere
whether
he
should
ever
eat
again
but
he
would
not
betray
his
feelings
to
a
servant
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
driving
rapidly
with
ellis
toward
the
office
of
the
morning
chronicle
ellis
could
see
that
delamere
had
discovered
something
of
tragic
import
neither
spoke
ellis
gave
all
his
attention
to
the
horses
and
delamere
remained
wrapped
in
his
own
sombre
reflections
when
they
reached
the
office
they
were
informed
by
jerry
that
major
carteret
was
engaged
with
general
belmont
and
captain
mcbane
delamere
knocked
peremptorily
at
the
door
of
the
inner
office
which
was
opened
by
carteret
in
person
oh
it
is
you
mr
delamere
carteret
exclaimed
delamere
i
must
speak
to
you
immediately
and
alone
excuse
me
a
moment
gentlemen
said
carteret
turning
to
those
within
the
room
i
be
back
in
a
moment
do
go
away
ellis
had
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
delamere
and
carteret
were
quite
alone
carteret
declared
the
old
gentleman
this
murder
must
not
take
place
is
a
hard
word
replied
the
editor
frowning
slightly
it
is
the
right
word
rejoined
delamere
decidedly
it
would
be
a
foul
and
most
unnatural
murder
for
sandy
did
not
kill
mrs
ochiltree
carteret
with
difficulty
restrained
a
smile
of
pity
his
old
friend
was
very
much
excited
as
the
tremor
in
his
voice
gave
proof
the
criminal
was
his
trusted
servant
who
had
proved
unworthy
of
confidence
no
one
could
question
delamere
motives
but
he
was
old
his
judgment
was
no
longer
to
be
relied
upon
it
was
a
great
pity
that
he
should
so
excite
and
overstrain
himself
about
a
worthless
negro
who
had
forfeited
his
life
for
a
dastardly
crime
delamere
had
had
two
paralytic
strokes
and
a
third
might
prove
fatal
he
must
be
dealt
with
gently
delamere
he
said
with
patient
tolerance
i
think
you
are
deceived
there
is
but
one
sure
way
to
stop
this
execution
if
your
servant
is
innocent
you
must
produce
the
real
criminal
if
the
negro
with
such
overwhelming
proofs
against
him
is
not
guilty
who
is
i
will
tell
you
who
is
replied
delamere
the
murderer
is
the
words
came
with
a
note
of
anguish
as
though
torn
from
his
very
heart
the
murderer
is
tom
delamere
my
own
grandson
impossible
sir
exclaimed
carteret
starting
back
involuntarily
that
could
not
be
the
man
was
seen
leaving
the
house
and
he
was
black
all
cats
are
gray
in
the
dark
carteret
and
moreover
nothing
is
easier
than
for
a
white
man
to
black
his
face
god
alone
knows
how
many
crimes
have
been
done
in
this
guise
tom
delamere
to
get
the
money
to
pay
his
gambling
debts
committed
this
foul
murder
and
then
tried
to
fasten
it
upon
as
honest
and
faithful
a
soul
as
ever
trod
the
earth
carteret
though
at
first
overwhelmed
by
this
announcement
perceived
with
quick
intuition
that
it
might
easily
be
true
it
was
but
a
step
from
fraud
to
crime
and
in
delamere
need
of
money
there
lay
a
palpable
motive
for
robbery
the
murder
may
have
been
an
afterthought
delamere
knew
as
much
about
the
cedar
chest
as
the
negro
could
have
known
and
more
but
a
white
man
must
not
be
condemned
without
proof
positive
what
foundation
is
there
sir
he
asked
for
this
astounding
charge
delamere
related
all
that
had
taken
place
since
he
had
left
belleview
a
couple
of
hours
before
and
as
he
proceeded
step
by
step
every
word
carried
conviction
to
carteret
tom
delamere
skill
as
a
mimic
and
a
negro
impersonator
was
well
known
he
had
himself
laughed
at
more
than
one
of
his
performances
there
had
been
a
powerful
motive
and
delamere
discoveries
had
made
clear
the
means
tom
unusual
departure
before
breakfast
on
a
fishing
expedition
was
a
suspicious
circumstance
there
was
a
certain
devilish
ingenuity
about
the
affair
which
he
would
hardly
have
expected
of
tom
delamere
but
for
which
the
reason
was
clear
enough
one
might
have
thought
that
tom
would
have
been
satisfied
with
merely
blacking
his
face
and
leaving
to
chance
the
identification
of
the
negro
who
might
be
apprehended
he
would
hardly
have
implicated
out
of
pure
malignity
his
grandfather
old
servant
who
had
been
his
own
for
many
years
here
however
carteret
could
see
where
tom
own
desperate
position
operated
to
furnish
a
probable
motive
for
the
crime
the
surest
way
to
head
off
suspicion
from
himself
was
to
direct
it
strongly
toward
some
particular
person
and
this
he
had
been
able
to
do
conclusively
by
his
access
to
clothes
his
skill
in
making
up
to
resemble
him
and
by
the
episode
of
the
silk
purse
by
placing
himself
beyond
reach
during
the
next
day
he
would
not
be
called
upon
to
corroborate
or
deny
any
inculpating
statements
which
sandy
might
make
and
in
the
very
probable
case
that
the
crime
should
be
summarily
avenged
any
such
statements
on
part
would
be
regarded
as
mere
desperate
subterfuges
of
the
murderer
to
save
his
own
life
it
was
a
bad
affair
the
case
seems
clear
said
carteret
reluctantly
but
conclusively
and
now
what
shall
we
do
about
it
i
want
you
to
print
a
handbill
said
delamere
and
circulate
it
through
the
town
stating
that
sandy
campbell
is
innocent
and
tom
delamere
guilty
of
this
crime
if
this
is
not
done
i
will
go
myself
and
declare
it
to
all
who
will
listen
and
i
will
publicly
disown
the
villain
who
is
no
more
grandson
of
mine
there
is
no
deeper
sink
of
iniquity
into
which
he
could
fall
carteret
thoughts
were
chasing
one
another
tumultuously
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
negro
was
innocent
from
the
present
aspect
of
affairs
and
he
must
not
be
lynched
but
in
what
sort
of
position
would
the
white
people
be
placed
if
delamere
carried
out
his
spartan
purpose
of
making
the
true
facts
known
the
white
people
of
the
city
had
raised
the
issue
of
their
own
superior
morality
and
had
themselves
made
this
crime
a
race
question
the
success
of
the
impending
revolution
for
which
he
and
his
had
labored
so
long
depended
in
large
measure
upon
the
maintenance
of
their
race
prestige
which
would
be
injured
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
by
such
a
fiasco
while
they
might
yet
win
by
sheer
force
their
cause
would
suffer
in
the
court
of
morals
where
they
might
stand
convicted
as
pirates
instead
of
being
applauded
as
patriots
even
the
negroes
would
have
the
laugh
on
them
the
people
whom
they
hoped
to
make
approve
and
justify
their
own
despoilment
to
be
laughed
at
by
the
negroes
was
a
calamity
only
less
terrible
than
failure
or
death
such
an
outcome
of
an
event
which
had
already
been
heralded
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
would
throw
a
cloud
of
suspicion
upon
the
stories
of
outrage
which
had
gone
up
from
the
south
for
so
many
years
and
had
done
so
much
to
win
the
sympathy
of
the
north
for
the
white
south
and
to
alienate
it
from
the
colored
people
the
reputation
of
the
race
was
threatened
they
must
not
lynch
the
negro
and
yet
for
the
credit
of
the
town
its
aristocracy
and
the
race
the
truth
of
this
ghastly
story
must
not
see
the
light
at
least
not
yet
delamere
he
exclaimed
i
am
shocked
and
humiliated
the
negro
must
be
saved
of
course
but
consider
the
family
honor
tom
is
no
longer
a
member
of
my
family
i
disown
him
he
has
covered
the
family
name
my
name
sir
with
infamy
we
have
no
longer
a
family
honor
i
wish
never
to
hear
his
name
spoken
again
for
several
minutes
carteret
argued
with
his
old
friend
then
he
went
into
the
other
room
and
consulted
with
general
belmont
as
a
result
of
these
conferences
and
of
certain
urgent
messages
sent
out
within
half
an
hour
thirty
or
forty
of
the
leading
citizens
of
wellington
were
gathered
in
the
morning
chronicle
office
several
other
curious
persons
observing
that
there
was
something
in
the
wind
and
supposing
correctly
that
it
referred
to
the
projected
event
of
the
evening
crowded
in
with
those
who
had
been
invited
carteret
was
in
another
room
still
arguing
with
delamere
it
a
mere
formality
sir
he
was
saying
suavely
accompanied
by
a
mental
reservation
we
know
the
facts
but
this
must
be
done
to
justify
us
in
the
eyes
of
the
mob
in
calling
them
off
before
they
accomplish
their
purpose
carteret
said
the
old
man
in
a
voice
eloquent
of
the
struggle
through
which
he
had
passed
i
would
not
perjure
myself
to
prolong
my
own
miserable
existence
another
day
but
god
will
forgive
a
sin
committed
to
save
another
life
upon
your
head
be
it
carteret
and
not
on
mine
gentlemen
said
carteret
entering
with
delamere
the
room
where
the
men
were
gathered
and
raising
his
hand
for
silence
the
people
of
wellington
were
on
the
point
of
wreaking
vengeance
upon
a
negro
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
guilty
of
a
terrible
crime
the
white
men
of
this
city
impelled
by
the
highest
and
holiest
sentiments
were
about
to
take
steps
to
defend
their
hearthstones
and
maintain
the
purity
and
ascendency
of
their
race
your
purpose
sprung
from
hearts
wounded
in
their
tenderest
susceptibilities
shouted
a
tipsy
sailor
who
had
edged
in
with
the
crowd
but
this
same
sense
of
justice
continued
carteret
oratorically
which
would
lead
you
to
visit
swift
and
terrible
punishment
upon
the
guilty
would
not
permit
you
to
slay
an
innocent
man
even
a
negro
as
long
as
he
behaves
himself
and
keeps
in
his
place
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
law
we
may
be
stern
and
unbending
in
the
punishment
of
crime
as
befits
our
masterful
race
but
we
hold
the
scales
of
justice
with
even
and
impartial
hand
f
ban
cried
the
tipsy
sailor
who
was
immediately
ejected
with
slight
ceremony
we
have
discovered
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
negro
sandy
campbell
now
in
custody
did
not
commit
this
robbery
and
murder
but
that
it
was
perpetrated
by
some
unknown
man
who
has
fled
from
the
city
our
venerable
and
distinguished
fellow
townsman
delamere
in
whose
employment
this
campbell
has
been
for
many
years
will
vouch
for
his
character
and
states
furthermore
that
campbell
was
with
him
all
last
night
covering
any
hour
at
which
this
crime
could
have
been
committed
if
delamere
will
swear
to
that
said
some
one
in
the
crowd
the
negro
should
not
be
lynched
there
were
murmurs
of
dissent
the
preparations
had
all
been
made
there
would
be
great
disappointment
if
the
lynching
did
not
occur
let
delamere
swear
if
he
wants
to
save
the
nigger
came
again
from
the
crowd
certainly
assented
carteret
delamere
can
have
no
possible
objection
to
taking
the
oath
is
there
a
notary
public
present
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
a
man
stepped
forward
i
am
a
justice
of
the
peace
he
announced
very
well
smith
said
carteret
recognizing
the
speaker
with
your
permission
i
will
formulate
the
oath
and
delamere
may
repeat
it
after
me
if
he
will
i
solemnly
swear
i
solemnly
swear
delamere
voice
might
have
come
from
the
tomb
so
hollow
and
unnatural
did
it
sound
so
help
me
god
so
help
me
god
that
the
negro
sandy
campbell
now
in
jail
on
the
charge
of
murder
robbery
and
assault
was
in
my
presence
last
night
between
the
hours
of
eight
and
two
delamere
repeated
this
statement
in
a
firm
voice
but
to
ellis
who
was
in
the
secret
his
words
fell
upon
the
ear
like
clods
dropping
upon
the
coffin
in
an
open
grave
i
wish
to
add
said
general
belmont
stepping
forward
that
it
is
not
our
intention
to
interfere
by
anything
which
may
be
done
at
this
meeting
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
law
or
to
advise
the
prisoner
immediate
release
the
prisoner
will
remain
in
custody
delamere
major
carteret
and
i
guaranteeing
that
he
will
be
proved
entirely
innocent
at
the
preliminary
hearing
morning
several
of
those
present
looked
relieved
others
were
plainly
disappointed
but
when
the
meeting
ended
the
news
went
out
that
the
lynching
had
been
given
up
carteret
immediately
wrote
and
had
struck
off
a
handbill
giving
a
brief
statement
of
the
proceedings
and
sent
out
a
dozen
boys
to
distribute
copies
among
the
people
in
the
streets
that
no
precaution
might
be
omitted
a
call
was
issued
to
the
wellington
grays
the
crack
independent
military
company
of
the
city
who
in
an
incredibly
short
time
were
on
guard
at
the
jail
thus
a
slight
change
in
the
point
of
view
had
demonstrated
the
entire
ability
of
the
leading
citizens
to
maintain
the
dignified
and
orderly
processes
of
the
law
whenever
they
saw
fit
to
do
so
the
night
passed
without
disorder
beyond
the
somewhat
rough
handling
of
two
or
three
careless
negroes
that
came
in
the
way
of
small
parties
of
the
disappointed
who
had
sought
alcoholic
consolation
at
ten
the
next
morning
a
preliminary
hearing
of
the
charge
against
campbell
was
had
before
a
magistrate
delamere
perceptibly
older
and
more
wizened
than
he
had
seemed
the
day
before
and
leaning
heavily
on
the
arm
of
a
servant
repeated
his
statement
of
the
evening
before
only
one
or
two
witnesses
were
called
among
whom
was
ellis
who
swore
positively
that
in
his
opinion
the
prisoner
was
not
the
man
whom
he
had
seen
and
at
first
supposed
to
be
campbell
the
most
sensational
piece
of
testimony
was
that
of
price
who
had
examined
the
body
and
who
swore
that
the
wound
in
the
head
was
not
necessarily
fatal
and
might
have
been
due
to
a
fall
that
she
had
more
than
likely
died
of
shock
attendant
upon
the
robbery
she
being
of
advanced
age
and
feeble
health
there
was
no
evidence
he
said
of
any
other
personal
violence
sandy
was
not
even
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury
but
was
discharged
upon
the
ground
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
upon
which
to
hold
him
upon
his
release
he
received
the
congratulations
of
many
present
some
of
whom
would
cheerfully
have
done
him
to
death
a
few
hours
before
with
the
childish
fickleness
of
a
mob
they
now
experienced
a
satisfaction
almost
as
great
as
though
less
exciting
than
that
attendant
upon
taking
life
we
speak
of
the
mysteries
of
inanimate
nature
the
workings
of
the
human
heart
are
the
profoundest
mystery
of
the
universe
one
moment
they
make
us
despair
of
our
kind
and
the
next
we
see
in
them
the
reflection
of
the
divine
image
sandy
having
thus
escaped
from
the
hyde
of
the
mob
now
received
the
benediction
of
its
jekyll
being
no
cynical
philosopher
and
realizing
how
nearly
the
jaws
of
death
had
closed
upon
him
he
was
profoundly
grateful
for
his
escape
and
felt
not
the
slightest
desire
to
investigate
or
criticise
any
man
motives
with
the
testimony
of
price
the
worst
feature
of
the
affair
came
to
an
end
the
murder
eliminated
or
rendered
doubtful
the
crime
became
a
mere
vulgar
robbery
the
extent
of
which
no
one
could
estimate
since
no
living
soul
knew
how
much
money
ochiltree
had
had
in
the
cedar
chest
the
absurdity
of
the
remaining
charge
became
more
fully
apparent
in
the
light
of
the
reaction
from
the
excitement
of
the
day
before
nothing
further
was
ever
done
about
the
case
but
though
the
crime
went
unpunished
it
carried
evil
in
its
train
as
we
have
seen
the
charge
against
campbell
had
been
made
against
the
whole
colored
race
all
over
the
united
states
the
associated
press
had
flashed
the
report
of
another
dastardly
outrage
by
a
burly
black
brute
all
black
brutes
it
seems
are
burly
and
of
the
impending
lynching
with
its
prospective
horrors
this
news
being
highly
sensational
in
its
character
had
been
displayed
in
large
black
type
on
the
front
pages
of
the
daily
papers
the
dispatch
that
followed
to
the
effect
that
the
accused
had
been
found
innocent
and
the
lynching
frustrated
received
slight
attention
if
any
in
a
paragraph
on
an
inside
page
the
facts
of
the
case
never
came
out
at
all
the
family
honor
of
the
delameres
was
preserved
and
the
prestige
of
the
white
race
in
wellington
was
not
seriously
impaired
upon
leaving
the
preliminary
hearing
old
delamere
had
requested
general
belmont
to
call
at
his
house
during
the
day
upon
professional
business
this
the
general
did
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
belmont
said
delamere
i
wish
to
make
my
will
i
should
have
drawn
it
with
my
own
hand
but
you
know
my
motives
and
can
testify
to
my
soundness
of
mind
and
memory
he
thereupon
dictated
a
will
by
the
terms
of
which
he
left
to
his
servant
sandy
campbell
three
thousand
dollars
as
a
mark
of
the
testator
appreciation
of
services
rendered
and
sufferings
endured
by
sandy
on
behalf
of
his
master
after
some
minor
dispositions
the
whole
remainder
of
the
estate
was
devised
to
william
miller
in
trust
for
the
uses
of
his
hospital
and
for
nurses
on
condition
that
the
institution
be
incorporated
and
placed
under
the
management
of
competent
trustees
tom
delamere
was
not
mentioned
in
the
will
there
belmont
he
said
that
load
is
off
my
mind
now
if
you
will
call
in
some
witnesses
most
of
my
people
can
write
i
shall
feel
entirely
at
ease
the
will
was
signed
by
delamere
and
witnessed
by
jeff
and
billy
two
servants
in
the
house
neither
of
whom
received
any
information
as
to
its
contents
beyond
the
statement
that
they
were
witnessing
their
master
will
i
wish
to
leave
that
with
you
for
safe
keeping
belmont
said
delamere
after
the
witnesses
had
retired
lock
it
up
in
your
safe
until
i
die
which
will
not
be
very
long
since
i
have
no
further
desire
to
live
an
hour
later
delamere
suffered
a
third
paralytic
stroke
from
which
he
died
two
days
afterwards
without
having
in
the
meantime
recovered
the
power
of
speech
the
will
was
never
produced
the
servants
stated
and
general
belmont
admitted
that
delamere
had
made
a
will
a
few
days
before
his
death
but
since
it
was
not
discoverable
it
seemed
probable
that
the
testator
had
destroyed
it
this
was
all
the
more
likely
the
general
was
inclined
to
think
because
the
will
had
been
of
a
most
unusual
character
what
the
contents
of
the
will
were
he
of
course
did
not
state
it
having
been
made
under
the
seal
of
professional
secrecy
this
suppression
was
justified
by
the
usual
race
argument
hospital
was
already
well
established
and
like
most
negro
institutions
could
no
doubt
rely
upon
northern
philanthropy
for
any
further
support
it
might
need
delamere
property
belonged
of
right
to
the
white
race
and
by
the
higher
law
should
remain
in
the
possession
of
white
people
loyalty
to
one
race
was
a
more
sacred
principle
than
deference
to
a
weak
old
man
whims
having
reached
this
conclusion
general
belmont
first
impulse
was
to
destroy
the
will
on
second
thoughts
he
locked
it
carefully
away
in
his
safe
he
would
hold
it
awhile
it
might
some
time
be
advisable
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
young
delamere
who
was
of
a
fickle
disposition
and
might
wish
to
change
his
legal
adviser
xxviii
in
season
and
out
wellington
soon
resumed
its
wonted
calm
and
in
a
few
weeks
the
intended
lynching
was
only
a
memory
the
robbery
and
assault
however
still
remained
a
mystery
to
all
but
a
chosen
few
the
affair
had
been
dropped
as
absolutely
as
though
it
had
never
occurred
no
colored
man
ever
learned
the
reason
of
this
sudden
change
of
front
and
sandy
loyalty
to
his
old
employer
memory
kept
him
silent
tom
delamere
did
not
offer
to
retain
sandy
in
his
service
though
he
presented
him
with
most
of
the
old
gentleman
wardrobe
it
is
only
justice
to
tom
to
state
that
up
to
this
time
he
had
not
been
informed
of
the
contents
of
his
grandfather
latest
will
major
carteret
gave
sandy
employment
as
butler
thus
making
a
sort
of
vicarious
atonement
on
the
part
of
the
white
race
of
which
the
major
felt
himself
in
a
way
the
embodiment
for
the
risk
to
which
sandy
had
been
subjected
shortly
after
these
events
sandy
was
restored
to
the
bosom
of
the
church
and
enfolded
by
its
sheltering
arms
was
no
longer
tempted
to
stray
from
the
path
of
rectitude
but
became
even
a
more
rigid
methodist
than
before
his
recent
troubles
tom
delamere
did
not
call
upon
clara
again
in
the
character
of
a
lover
of
course
they
could
not
help
meeting
from
time
to
time
but
he
never
dared
presume
upon
their
former
relations
indeed
the
social
atmosphere
of
wellington
remained
so
frigid
toward
delamere
that
he
left
town
and
did
not
return
for
several
months
ellis
was
aware
that
delamere
had
been
thrown
over
but
a
certain
delicacy
restrained
him
from
following
up
immediately
the
advantage
which
the
absence
of
his
former
rival
gave
him
it
seemed
to
him
with
the
quixotry
of
a
clean
pure
mind
that
clara
would
pass
through
a
period
of
mourning
for
her
lost
illusion
and
that
it
would
be
indelicate
for
the
time
being
to
approach
her
with
a
attentions
the
work
of
the
office
had
been
unusually
heavy
of
late
the
major
deeply
absorbed
in
politics
left
the
detail
work
of
the
paper
to
ellis
into
the
intimate
counsels
of
the
revolutionary
committee
ellis
had
not
been
admitted
nor
would
he
have
desired
to
be
he
knew
of
course
in
a
general
way
the
results
that
it
was
sought
to
achieve
and
while
he
did
not
see
their
necessity
he
deferred
to
the
views
of
older
men
and
was
satisfied
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
anything
which
he
might
disapprove
moreover
his
own
personal
affairs
occupied
his
mind
to
an
extent
that
made
politics
or
any
other
subject
a
matter
of
minor
importance
as
for
miller
he
never
learned
of
delamere
good
intentions
toward
his
institution
but
regretted
the
old
gentleman
death
as
the
loss
of
a
sincere
friend
and
of
his
race
in
their
unequal
struggle
despite
the
untiring
zeal
of
carteret
and
his
associates
the
campaign
for
the
restriction
of
the
suffrage
which
was
to
form
the
basis
of
a
permanent
white
supremacy
had
seemed
to
languish
for
a
while
after
the
ochiltree
affair
the
lull
however
was
only
temporary
and
more
apparent
than
real
for
the
forces
adverse
to
the
negro
were
merely
gathering
strength
for
a
more
vigorous
assault
while
little
was
said
in
wellington
public
sentiment
all
over
the
country
became
every
day
more
favorable
to
the
views
of
the
conspirators
the
nation
was
rushing
forward
with
giant
strides
toward
colossal
wealth
and
before
the
exigencies
of
which
mere
abstract
ethical
theories
must
not
be
permitted
to
stand
the
same
argument
that
justified
the
conquest
of
an
inferior
nation
could
not
be
denied
to
those
who
sought
the
suppression
of
an
inferior
race
in
the
south
an
obscure
jealousy
of
the
negro
progress
an
obscure
fear
of
the
very
equality
so
contemptuously
denied
furnished
a
rich
soil
for
successful
agitation
statistics
of
crime
ingeniously
manipulated
were
made
to
present
a
fearful
showing
against
the
negro
vital
statistics
were
made
to
prove
that
he
had
degenerated
from
an
imaginary
standard
of
physical
excellence
which
had
existed
under
the
benign
influence
of
slavery
constant
lynchings
emphasized
his
impotence
and
bred
everywhere
a
growing
contempt
for
his
rights
at
the
north
a
new
pharaoh
had
risen
who
knew
not
israel
a
new
generation
who
knew
little
of
the
fierce
passions
which
had
played
around
the
negro
in
a
past
epoch
and
derived
their
opinions
of
him
from
the
coon
song
and
the
police
reports
those
of
his
old
friends
who
survived
were
disappointed
that
he
had
not
flown
with
clipped
wings
that
he
had
not
in
one
generation
of
limited
opportunity
attained
the
level
of
the
whites
the
whole
race
question
seemed
to
have
reached
a
sort
of
a
blind
alley
of
which
no
one
could
see
the
outlet
the
negro
had
become
a
target
at
which
any
one
might
try
a
shot
schoolboys
gravely
debated
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
negro
should
exercise
the
franchise
the
pessimist
gave
him
up
in
despair
while
the
optimist
smilingly
confident
that
everything
would
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
also
turned
aside
and
went
his
buoyant
way
to
more
pleasing
themes
for
a
time
there
were
white
men
in
the
state
who
opposed
any
reactionary
step
unless
it
were
of
general
application
they
were
conscientious
men
who
had
learned
the
ten
commandments
and
wished
to
do
right
but
this
class
was
a
small
minority
and
their
objections
were
soon
silenced
by
the
race
argument
selfishness
is
the
most
constant
of
human
motives
patriotism
humanity
or
the
love
of
god
may
lead
to
sporadic
outbursts
which
sweep
away
the
wrongs
of
centuries
but
they
languish
at
times
while
the
love
of
self
works
on
ceaselessly
unwearyingly
burrowing
always
at
the
very
roots
of
life
and
heaping
up
fresh
wrongs
for
other
centuries
to
sweep
away
the
state
was
at
the
mercy
of
venal
and
politicians
bent
upon
regaining
their
ascendency
at
any
cost
stultifying
their
own
minds
by
vague
sophistries
and
phrases
which
deceived
none
but
those
who
wished
to
be
deceived
and
these
but
imperfectly
and
dulling
the
public
conscience
by
a
loud
clamor
in
which
the
calm
voice
of
truth
was
for
the
moment
silenced
so
the
cause
went
on
carteret
as
spokesman
of
the
campaign
and
sincerest
of
all
its
leaders
performed
prodigies
of
labor
the
morning
chronicle
proclaimed
in
season
and
out
the
doctrine
of
white
supremacy
leaving
the
paper
in
charge
of
ellis
the
major
made
a
tour
of
the
state
rousing
the
white
people
of
the
better
class
to
an
appreciation
of
the
terrible
danger
which
confronted
them
in
the
possibility
that
a
few
negroes
might
hold
a
few
offices
or
dictate
the
terms
upon
which
white
men
should
fill
them
difficulties
were
explained
away
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
it
was
maintained
must
yield
to
the
higher
law
and
if
the
constitution
could
neither
be
altered
nor
bent
to
this
end
means
must
be
found
to
circumvent
it
the
device
finally
hit
upon
for
disfranchising
the
colored
people
in
this
particular
state
was
the
notorious
grandfather
clause
after
providing
various
restrictions
of
the
suffrage
based
upon
education
character
and
property
which
it
was
deemed
would
in
effect
disfranchise
the
colored
race
an
exception
was
made
in
favor
of
all
citizens
whose
fathers
or
grandfathers
had
been
entitled
to
vote
prior
to
since
none
but
white
men
could
vote
prior
to
this
exception
obviously
took
in
the
poor
and
ignorant
whites
while
the
same
class
of
negroes
were
excluded
it
was
ingenious
but
it
was
not
fair
in
due
time
a
constitutional
convention
was
called
in
which
the
above
scheme
was
adopted
and
submitted
to
a
vote
of
the
people
for
ratification
the
campaign
was
fought
on
the
color
line
many
white
republicans
deluded
with
the
hope
that
by
the
elimination
of
the
negro
vote
their
party
might
receive
accessions
from
the
democratic
ranks
went
over
to
the
white
party
by
fraud
in
one
place
by
terrorism
in
another
and
everywhere
by
the
resistless
moral
force
of
the
united
whites
the
negroes
were
reduced
to
the
apathy
of
despair
their
few
white
allies
demoralized
and
the
amendment
adopted
by
a
large
majority
the
negroes
were
taught
that
this
is
a
white
man
country
and
that
the
sooner
they
made
up
their
minds
to
this
fact
the
better
for
all
concerned
the
white
people
would
be
good
to
them
so
long
as
they
behaved
themselves
and
kept
their
place
as
theoretical
equals
practical
equality
being
forever
out
of
the
question
either
by
nature
or
by
law
there
could
have
been
nothing
but
strife
between
them
in
which
the
weaker
party
would
invariably
have
suffered
most
some
colored
men
accepted
the
situation
thus
outlined
if
not
as
desirable
at
least
as
inevitable
most
of
them
however
had
little
faith
in
this
condescending
friendliness
which
was
to
take
the
place
of
constitutional
rights
they
knew
they
had
been
treated
unfairly
that
their
enemies
had
prevailed
against
them
that
their
whilom
friends
had
stood
passively
by
and
seen
them
undone
many
of
the
most
enterprising
and
progressive
left
the
state
and
those
who
remain
still
labor
under
a
sense
of
wrong
and
outrage
which
renders
them
distinctly
less
valuable
as
citizens
the
great
steal
was
made
but
the
thieves
did
not
turn
honest
the
scheme
still
shows
the
mark
of
the
burglar
tools
sins
like
chickens
come
home
to
roost
the
south
paid
a
fearful
price
for
the
wrong
of
negro
slavery
in
some
form
or
other
it
will
doubtless
reap
the
fruits
of
this
later
iniquity
drastic
as
were
these
reforms
the
results
of
which
we
have
anticipated
somewhat
since
the
new
constitution
was
not
to
take
effect
immediately
they
moved
all
too
slowly
for
the
little
coterie
of
wellington
conspirators
whose
ambitions
and
needs
urged
them
to
prompt
action
under
the
new
constitution
it
would
be
two
full
years
before
the
nigger
amendment
became
effective
and
meanwhile
the
wellington
district
would
remain
hopelessly
republican
the
committee
decided
about
two
months
before
the
fall
election
that
an
active
local
campaign
must
be
carried
on
with
a
view
to
discourage
the
negroes
from
attending
the
polls
on
election
day
the
question
came
up
for
discussion
one
forenoon
in
a
meeting
at
the
office
of
the
morning
chronicle
at
which
all
of
the
big
three
were
present
something
must
be
done
declared
mcbane
and
that
damn
quick
too
many
white
people
are
saying
that
it
will
be
better
to
wait
until
the
amendment
goes
into
effect
that
would
mean
to
leave
the
niggers
in
charge
of
this
town
for
two
years
after
the
state
has
declared
for
white
supremacy
i
opposed
to
leaving
it
in
their
hands
one
hour
my
sentiments
this
proved
to
be
the
general
opinion
and
the
discussion
turned
to
the
subject
of
ways
and
means
what
became
of
that
editorial
in
the
nigger
paper
inquired
the
general
in
his
blandest
tones
cleverly
directing
a
smoke
ring
toward
the
ceiling
it
lost
some
of
its
point
back
there
when
we
came
near
lynching
that
nigger
but
now
that
that
has
blown
over
why
would
it
be
a
good
thing
to
bring
into
play
at
the
present
juncture
let
read
it
over
again
carteret
extracted
the
paper
from
the
where
he
had
placed
it
some
months
before
the
article
was
read
aloud
with
emphasis
and
discussed
phrase
by
phrase
of
its
wording
there
could
be
little
criticism
it
was
temperately
and
even
cautiously
phrased
as
suggested
by
the
general
the
ochiltree
affair
had
proved
that
it
was
not
devoid
of
truth
its
great
offensiveness
lay
in
its
boldness
that
a
negro
should
publish
in
a
newspaper
what
white
people
would
scarcely
acknowledge
to
themselves
in
secret
was
much
as
though
a
russian
or
a
german
peasant
should
rush
into
print
to
question
the
divine
right
of
the
lord
anointed
the
article
was
racial
in
the
most
aggravated
form
a
peg
was
needed
upon
which
to
hang
a
and
this
editorial
offered
the
requisite
opportunity
it
was
unanimously
decided
to
republish
the
obnoxious
article
with
comment
adapted
to
fire
the
inflammable
southern
heart
and
rouse
it
against
any
further
of
the
negroes
in
politics
or
elsewhere
the
time
is
ripe
exclaimed
mcbane
in
a
month
we
can
have
the
niggers
so
scared
that
they
wo
dare
stick
their
heads
out
of
doors
on
day
i
wonder
observed
the
general
thoughtfully
after
this
conclusion
had
been
reached
if
we
could
have
jerry
fetch
us
some
liquor
jerry
appeared
in
response
to
the
usual
summons
the
general
gave
him
the
money
and
ordered
three
calhoun
cocktails
when
jerry
returned
with
the
glasses
on
a
tray
the
general
observed
him
with
pointed
curiosity
what
in
h
ll
is
the
matter
with
you
jerry
your
black
face
is
splotched
with
brown
and
yellow
patches
and
your
hair
shines
as
though
you
had
fallen
into
a
firkin
of
butter
what
the
matter
with
you
jerry
seemed
much
embarrassed
by
this
inquiry
nothin
suh
nothin
he
stammered
it
it
jes
somethin
i
puttin
on
my
hair
suh
ter
improve
de
quality
suh
jerry
returned
the
general
bending
a
solemn
look
upon
the
porter
you
have
been
playing
with
edged
tools
and
your
days
are
numbered
you
have
been
reading
the
banner
he
shook
open
the
paper
which
he
had
retained
in
his
hand
and
read
from
one
of
the
advertisements
curly
hair
made
straight
in
two
applications
dark
skins
lightened
two
shades
mulattoes
turned
perfectly
white
this
stuff
is
rank
poison
jerry
continued
the
general
with
a
mock
solemnity
which
did
not
impose
upon
jerry
who
nevertheless
listened
with
an
air
of
great
alarm
he
suspected
that
the
general
was
making
fun
of
him
but
he
also
knew
that
the
general
would
like
to
think
that
jerry
believed
him
in
earnest
and
to
please
the
white
folks
was
consistent
aim
in
life
i
can
see
the
signs
of
decay
in
your
face
and
your
hair
will
all
fall
out
in
a
week
or
two
at
the
latest
mark
my
words
mcbane
had
listened
to
this
pleasantry
with
a
sardonic
sneer
it
was
a
waste
of
valuable
time
to
carteret
it
seemed
in
doubtful
taste
these
grotesque
advertisements
had
their
tragic
side
they
were
proof
that
the
negroes
had
read
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
these
pitiful
attempts
to
change
their
physical
characteristics
were
an
acknowledgment
on
their
own
part
that
the
negro
was
doomed
and
that
the
white
man
was
to
inherit
the
earth
and
hold
all
other
races
under
his
heel
for
as
the
months
had
passed
carteret
thoughts
centring
more
and
more
upon
the
negro
had
led
him
farther
and
farther
until
now
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
there
was
no
permanent
place
for
the
negro
in
the
united
states
if
indeed
anywhere
in
the
world
except
under
the
ground
more
pathetic
even
than
jerry
efforts
to
escape
from
the
universal
doom
of
his
race
was
his
ignorance
that
even
if
he
could
by
some
strange
alchemy
bleach
his
skin
and
straighten
his
hair
there
would
still
remain
underneath
it
all
only
the
unbleached
darky
the
ass
in
the
lion
skin
when
the
general
had
finished
his
facetious
lecture
jerry
backed
out
of
the
room
shamefacedly
though
affecting
a
greater
confusion
than
he
really
felt
jerry
had
not
reasoned
so
closely
as
carteret
but
he
had
realized
that
it
was
a
distinct
advantage
to
be
white
an
advantage
which
white
people
had
utilized
to
secure
all
the
best
things
in
the
world
and
he
had
entertained
the
vague
hope
that
by
changing
his
complexion
he
might
share
this
prerogative
while
he
suspected
the
general
sincerity
he
nevertheless
felt
a
little
apprehensive
lest
the
general
prediction
about
the
effects
of
the
and
other
preparations
might
prove
true
the
general
was
a
white
gentleman
and
ought
to
know
and
decided
to
abandon
their
use
this
purpose
was
strengthened
by
his
next
interview
with
the
major
when
carteret
summoned
him
an
hour
later
after
the
other
gentlemen
had
taken
their
leave
jerry
had
washed
his
head
thoroughly
and
there
remained
no
trace
of
the
pomade
an
attempt
to
darken
the
lighter
spots
in
his
cuticle
by
the
application
of
printer
ink
had
not
proved
equally
successful
the
retouching
left
the
spots
as
much
too
dark
as
they
had
formerly
been
too
light
jerry
said
carteret
sternly
when
i
hired
you
to
work
for
the
chronicle
you
were
black
the
word
means
the
best
negro
is
a
black
negro
of
the
pure
type
as
it
came
from
the
hand
of
god
if
you
wish
to
get
along
well
with
the
white
people
the
blacker
you
are
the
better
white
people
do
not
like
negroes
who
want
to
be
white
a
man
should
be
content
to
remain
as
god
made
him
and
where
god
placed
him
so
no
more
of
this
nonsense
are
you
going
to
vote
at
the
next
election
what
would
you
me
ter
do
suh
asked
jerry
cautiously
i
do
not
advise
you
you
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
see
where
your
own
interests
lie
i
put
it
to
you
whether
you
can
not
trust
yourself
more
safely
in
the
hands
of
white
gentlemen
who
are
your
true
friends
than
in
the
hands
of
ignorant
and
purchasable
negroes
and
unscrupulous
white
scoundrels
dere
no
doubt
about
it
suh
assented
jerry
with
a
vehemence
proportioned
to
his
desire
to
get
back
into
favor
i
ain
gwine
ter
have
nothin
ter
do
wid
de
suh
ef
i
don
vote
i
kin
keep
my
job
ca
i
suh
the
major
eyed
jerry
with
an
air
of
supreme
disgust
what
could
be
expected
of
a
race
so
utterly
devoid
of
tact
it
seemed
as
though
this
negro
thought
a
white
gentleman
might
want
to
bribe
him
to
remain
away
from
the
polls
and
the
negro
willingness
to
accept
the
imaginary
bribe
demonstrated
the
venal
nature
of
the
colored
race
its
entire
lack
of
moral
principle
you
will
retain
your
place
jerry
he
said
severely
so
long
as
you
perform
your
duties
to
my
satisfaction
and
behave
yourself
properly
with
this
grandiloquent
subterfuge
carteret
turned
to
his
next
article
on
white
supremacy
jerry
did
not
delude
himself
with
any
sophistry
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
held
his
job
upon
the
condition
that
he
stayed
away
from
the
polls
at
the
approaching
election
jerry
was
a
fool
the
world
of
fools
hath
such
a
store
that
he
who
would
not
see
an
ass
must
stay
at
home
and
shut
his
door
and
break
his
but
while
no
one
may
be
entirely
wise
there
are
degrees
of
folly
and
jerry
was
not
all
kinds
of
a
fool
xxix
mutterings
of
the
storm
events
moved
rapidly
during
the
next
few
days
the
reproduction
in
the
chronicle
of
the
article
from
the
banner
with
inflammatory
comment
took
immediate
effect
it
touched
the
southern
white
man
in
his
most
sensitive
spot
to
him
such
an
article
was
an
insult
to
white
womanhood
and
must
be
resented
by
some
active
steps
mere
words
would
be
no
answer
at
all
to
meet
words
with
words
upon
such
a
subject
would
be
to
acknowledge
the
equality
of
the
negro
and
his
right
to
discuss
or
criticise
the
conduct
of
the
white
people
the
colored
people
became
alarmed
at
the
murmurings
of
the
whites
which
seemed
to
presage
a
coming
storm
a
number
of
them
sought
to
arm
themselves
but
ascertained
upon
inquiring
at
the
stores
that
no
white
merchant
would
sell
a
negro
firearms
since
all
the
dealers
in
this
sort
of
merchandise
were
white
men
the
negroes
had
to
be
satisfied
with
oiling
up
the
old
army
muskets
which
some
of
them
possessed
and
the
few
revolvers
with
which
a
small
rowdy
element
generally
managed
to
keep
themselves
supplied
upon
an
effort
being
made
to
purchase
firearms
from
a
northern
city
the
express
company
controlled
by
local
men
refused
to
accept
the
consignment
the
white
people
on
the
other
hand
procured
both
arms
and
ammunition
in
large
quantities
and
the
wellington
grays
drilled
with
great
assiduity
at
their
armory
all
this
went
on
without
any
public
disturbance
of
the
tranquillity
a
stranger
would
have
seen
nothing
to
excite
his
curiosity
the
white
people
did
their
talking
among
themselves
and
merely
grew
more
distant
in
their
manner
toward
the
colored
folks
who
instinctively
closed
their
ranks
as
the
whites
drew
away
with
each
day
that
passed
the
feeling
grew
more
tense
the
editor
of
the
banner
whose
office
had
been
quietly
garrisoned
for
several
nights
by
armed
negroes
became
frightened
and
disappeared
from
the
town
between
two
suns
the
conspirators
were
jubilant
at
the
complete
success
of
their
plans
it
only
remained
for
them
to
so
direct
this
aroused
public
feeling
that
it
might
completely
accomplish
the
desired
end
to
change
the
political
complexion
of
the
city
government
and
assure
the
ascendency
of
the
whites
until
the
amendment
should
go
into
effect
a
revolution
and
not
a
riot
was
contemplated
with
this
end
in
view
another
meeting
was
called
at
carteret
office
we
are
now
ready
announced
general
belmont
for
the
final
act
of
this
drama
we
must
decide
promptly
or
events
may
run
away
from
us
what
do
you
suggest
asked
carteret
down
in
the
american
tropics
continued
the
general
they
have
a
way
of
doing
things
i
was
in
nicaragua
ten
years
ago
when
revolution
drove
out
igorroto
government
it
was
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
paterno
had
the
arms
and
the
best
men
igorroto
was
not
looking
for
trouble
and
the
guns
were
at
his
breast
before
he
knew
it
we
have
the
guns
the
negroes
are
not
expecting
trouble
and
are
easy
to
manage
compared
with
the
fiery
mixture
that
flourishes
in
the
tropics
i
should
not
advocate
murder
returned
carteret
we
are
animated
by
high
and
holy
principles
we
wish
to
right
a
wrong
to
remedy
an
abuse
to
save
our
state
from
anarchy
and
our
race
from
humiliation
i
object
to
frightening
the
negroes
but
i
am
opposed
to
unnecessary
bloodshed
i
not
quite
so
particular
struck
in
mcbane
they
need
to
be
taught
a
lesson
and
a
nigger
more
or
less
would
be
missed
too
many
of
now
of
course
continued
carteret
if
we
should
decide
upon
a
certain
mode
of
procedure
and
the
negroes
should
resist
a
different
reasoning
might
apply
but
i
will
have
no
premeditated
murder
in
central
and
south
america
observed
the
general
reflectively
none
are
hurt
except
those
who
get
in
the
way
there
be
no
niggers
hurt
said
mcbane
contemptuously
unless
they
strain
themselves
running
one
white
man
can
chase
a
hundred
of
i
managed
five
hundred
at
a
time
i
pay
for
burying
all
the
niggers
that
are
killed
the
conference
resulted
in
a
plan
to
be
put
into
operation
the
following
day
by
which
the
city
government
was
to
be
wrested
from
the
republicans
and
their
negro
allies
and
now
said
general
belmont
while
we
are
cleansing
the
augean
stables
we
may
as
well
remove
the
cause
as
the
effect
there
are
several
negroes
too
many
in
this
town
which
will
be
much
the
better
without
them
there
that
yellow
lawyer
watson
he
altogether
too
mouthy
and
has
too
much
business
every
nigger
that
gets
into
trouble
sends
for
watson
and
white
lawyers
with
families
to
support
and
social
positions
to
keep
up
are
deprived
of
their
legitimate
source
of
income
there
that
damn
nigger
real
estate
agent
blurted
out
mcbane
billy
kitchen
used
to
get
most
of
the
nigger
business
but
this
darky
has
almost
driven
him
to
the
poorhouse
a
white
business
man
is
entitled
to
a
living
in
his
own
profession
and
his
own
home
that
nigger
belong
here
nohow
he
came
from
the
north
a
year
or
two
ago
and
is
hand
in
glove
with
barber
the
nigger
editor
which
is
enough
of
itself
to
damn
him
have
to
go
how
about
the
collector
of
the
port
we
better
not
touch
him
it
would
bring
the
government
down
upon
us
which
we
want
to
avoid
we
do
need
to
worry
about
the
nigger
preachers
either
they
want
to
stay
here
where
the
loaves
and
the
fishes
are
we
can
make
write
letters
to
the
newspapers
justifying
our
course
as
a
condition
of
their
remaining
what
about
billings
asked
mcbane
billings
was
the
white
republican
mayor
is
that
skunk
to
be
allowed
to
stay
in
town
no
returned
the
general
every
white
republican
ought
to
be
made
to
go
this
town
is
only
big
enough
for
democrats
and
negroes
who
can
be
taught
to
keep
their
place
what
about
the
colored
doctor
queried
mcbane
with
the
hospital
and
the
diamond
ring
and
the
carriage
and
the
other
fallals
i
should
interfere
with
miller
replied
the
general
decisively
he
a
very
good
sort
of
a
negro
does
meddle
with
politics
nor
tread
on
any
one
else
toes
his
father
was
a
good
citizen
which
counts
in
his
favor
he
spending
money
in
the
community
too
and
contributes
to
its
prosperity
that
sort
of
nigger
though
sets
a
bad
example
retorted
mcbane
they
make
it
all
the
harder
to
keep
the
rest
of
down
swallow
does
not
make
a
summer
quoted
the
general
when
we
get
things
arranged
there
be
no
trouble
a
stream
can
not
rise
higher
than
its
fountain
and
a
smart
nigger
without
a
constituency
will
no
longer
be
an
object
of
fear
i
say
let
the
doctor
alone
he
have
to
keep
mighty
quiet
though
muttered
mcbane
discontentedly
i
do
like
smart
niggers
i
had
to
shoot
several
of
them
in
the
course
of
my
life
personally
i
dislike
the
man
interposed
carteret
and
if
i
consulted
my
own
inclinations
would
say
expel
him
with
the
rest
but
my
grievance
is
a
personal
one
and
to
gratify
it
in
that
way
would
be
a
loss
to
the
community
i
wish
to
be
strictly
impartial
in
this
matter
and
to
take
no
step
which
can
not
be
entirely
justified
by
a
wise
regard
for
the
public
welfare
what
the
use
of
all
this
hypocrisy
gentlemen
sneered
mcbane
every
last
one
of
us
has
an
axe
to
grind
the
major
may
as
well
put
an
edge
on
his
we
never
get
a
better
chance
to
have
things
our
way
if
this
nigger
doctor
annoys
the
major
we
run
him
out
with
the
rest
this
is
a
white
man
country
and
a
white
man
city
and
no
nigger
has
any
business
here
when
a
white
man
wants
him
gone
carteret
frowned
darkly
at
this
brutal
characterization
of
their
motives
it
robbed
the
enterprise
of
all
its
poetry
and
put
a
solemn
act
of
revolution
upon
the
plane
of
a
mere
vulgar
theft
of
power
even
the
general
winced
i
would
not
consent
he
said
irritably
to
miller
being
disturbed
mcbane
made
no
further
objection
there
was
a
discreet
knock
at
the
door
come

carteret
jerry
entered
mistuh
ellis

half
an
hour
later
the
conspirators
dispersed
they
had
fixed
the
hour
of
the
proposed
revolution
the
course
to
be
pursued
the
results
to
be
obtained
but
in
stating
their
equation
they
had
overlooked
one
factor
god
or
fate
or
whatever
one
may
choose
to
call
the
power
that
holds
the
destinies
of
man
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
xxx
the
missing
papers
carteret
was
very
much
disturbed
it
was
supposed
that
the
shock
of
her
aunt
death
had
affected
her
health
for
since
that
event
she
had
fallen
into
a
nervous
condition
which
gave
the
major
grave
concern
much
to
the
general
surprise
ochiltree
had
left
no
will
and
no
property
of
any
considerable
value
except
her
homestead
which
descended
to
carteret
as
the
natural
heir
whatever
she
may
have
had
on
hand
in
the
way
of
ready
money
had
undoubtedly
been
abstracted
from
the
cedar
chest
by
the
midnight
marauder
to
whose
visit
her
death
was
immediately
due
her
niece
grief
was
held
to
mark
a
affection
for
the
grim
old
woman
who
had
reared
her
carteret
present
state
of
mind
of
which
her
nervousness
was
a
sufficiently
accurate
reflection
did
in
truth
date
from
her
death
and
also
in
part
from
the
time
of
the
conversation
with
ochiltree
one
afternoon
during
and
after
the
drive
past
miller
new
hospital
ochiltree
had
grown
steadily
more
and
more
childish
after
that
time
and
her
niece
had
never
succeeded
in
making
her
pick
up
the
thread
of
thought
where
it
had
been
dropped
at
any
rate
ochiltree
had
made
no
further
disclosure
upon
the
subject
an
examination
not
long
after
her
aunt
death
of
the
papers
found
near
the
cedar
chest
on
the
morning
after
the
murder
had
contributed
to
carteret
enlightenment
but
had
not
promoted
her
peace
of
mind
when
carteret
reached
home
after
her
hurried
exploration
of
the
cedar
chest
she
thrust
into
a
bureau
drawer
the
envelope
she
had
found
so
fully
was
her
mind
occupied
for
several
days
with
the
funeral
and
with
the
excitement
attending
the
arrest
of
sandy
campbell
that
she
deferred
the
examination
of
the
contents
of
the
envelope
until
near
the
end
of
the
week
one
morning
while
alone
in
her
chamber
she
drew
the
envelope
from
the
drawer
and
was
holding
it
in
her
hand
hesitating
as
to
whether
or
not
she
should
open
it
when
the
baby
in
the
next
room
began
to
cry
the
child
cry
seemed
like
a
warning
and
yielding
to
a
vague
uneasiness
she
put
the
paper
back
phil
she
said
to
her
husband
at
luncheon
aunt
polly
said
some
strange
things
to
me
one
day
before
she
died
i
do
know
whether
she
was
quite
in
her
right
mind
or
not
but
suppose
that
my
father
had
left
a
will
by
which
it
was
provided
that
half
his
property
should
go
to
that
woman
and
her
child
it
would
never
have
gone
by
such
a
will
replied
the
major
easily
your
aunt
polly
was
in
her
dotage
and
merely
dreaming
your
father
would
never
have
been
such
a
fool
but
even
if
he
had
no
such
will
could
have
stood
the
test
of
the
courts
it
would
clearly
have
been
due
to
the
improper
influence
of
a
designing
woman
so
that
legally
as
well
as
morally
said
carteret
the
will
would
have
been
of
no
effect
not
the
slightest
a
jury
would
soon
have
broken
down
the
legal
claim
as
for
any
moral
obligation
there
would
have
been
nothing
moral
about
the
affair
the
only
possible
consideration
for
such
a
gift
was
an
immoral
one
i
do
wish
to
speak
harshly
of
your
father
my
dear
but
his
conduct
was
gravely
reprehensible
the
woman
herself
had
no
right
or
claim
whatever
she
would
have
been
whipped
and
expelled
from
the
town
if
justice
blind
bleeding
justice
then
prostrate
at
the
feet
of
slaves
and
aliens
could
have
had
her
way
but
the
child
the
child
was
in
the
same
category
who
was
she
to
have
inherited
the
estate
of
your
ancestors
of
which
a
few
years
before
she
would
herself
have
formed
a
part
the
child
of
shame
it
was
hers
to
pay
the
penalty
but
the
discussion
is
all
in
the
air
olivia
your
father
never
did
and
never
would
have
left
such
a
will
this
conversation
relieved
carteret
uneasiness
going
to
her
room
shortly
afterwards
she
took
the
envelope
from
her
bureau
drawer
and
drew
out
a
bulky
paper
the
haunting
fear
that
it
might
be
such
a
will
as
her
aunt
had
suggested
was
now
removed
for
such
an
instrument
in
the
light
of
what
her
husband
had
said
confirming
her
own
intuitions
would
be
of
no
valid
effect
it
might
be
just
as
well
she
thought
to
throw
the
paper
in
the
fire
without
looking
at
it
she
wished
to
think
as
well
as
might
be
of
her
father
and
she
felt
that
her
respect
for
his
memory
would
not
be
strengthened
by
the
knowledge
that
he
had
meant
to
leave
his
estate
away
from
her
for
her
aunt
words
had
been
open
to
the
construction
that
she
was
to
have
been
left
destitute
curiosity
strongly
prompted
her
to
read
the
paper
perhaps
the
will
contained
no
such
provision
as
she
had
feared
and
it
might
convey
some
request
or
direction
which
ought
properly
to
be
complied
with
she
had
been
standing
in
front
of
the
bureau
while
these
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
and
now
dropping
the
envelope
back
into
the
drawer
mechanically
she
unfolded
the
document
it
was
written
on
legal
paper
in
her
father
own
hand
carteret
was
not
familiar
with
legal
verbiage
and
there
were
several
expressions
of
which
she
did
not
perhaps
appreciate
the
full
effect
but
a
very
hasty
glance
enabled
her
to
ascertain
the
purport
of
the
paper
it
was
a
will
by
which
in
one
item
her
father
devised
to
his
daughter
janet
the
child
of
the
woman
known
as
julia
brown
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
and
a
certain
plantation
or
tract
of
land
a
short
distance
from
the
town
of
wellington
the
rest
and
residue
of
his
estate
after
deducting
all
legal
charges
and
expenses
was
bequeathed
to
his
beloved
daughter
olivia
merkell
carteret
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
her
father
had
not
preferred
another
to
her
but
had
left
to
his
lawful
daughter
the
bulk
of
his
estate
she
felt
at
the
same
time
a
growing
indignation
at
the
thought
that
that
woman
should
so
have
wrought
upon
her
father
weakness
as
to
induce
him
to
think
of
leaving
so
much
valuable
property
to
her
bastard
property
which
by
right
should
go
and
now
would
go
to
her
own
son
to
whom
by
every
rule
of
law
and
decency
it
ought
to
descend
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
next
room
on
account
of
the
baby
there
had
been
a
light
frost
the
night
before
and
the
air
was
somewhat
chilly
for
the
moment
the
room
was
empty
carteret
came
out
from
her
chamber
and
threw
the
offending
paper
into
the
fire
and
watched
it
slowly
burn
when
it
had
been
consumed
the
carbon
residue
of
one
sheet
still
retained
its
form
and
she
could
read
the
words
on
the
charred
portion
a
sentence
which
had
escaped
her
eye
in
her
rapid
reading
stood
out
in
ghostly
black
upon
the
gray
background
all
the
rest
and
residue
of
my
estate
i
devise
and
bequeath
to
my
daughter
olivia
merkell
the
child
of
my
beloved
first
wife
carteret
had
not
before
observed
the
word
first
instinctively
she
stretched
toward
the
fire
the
poker
which
she
held
in
her
hand
and
at
its
touch
the
shadowy
remnant
fell
to
pieces
and
nothing
but
ashes
remained
upon
the
hearth
not
until
the
next
morning
did
she
think
again
of
the
envelope
which
had
contained
the
paper
she
had
burned
opening
the
drawer
where
it
lay
the
oblong
blue
envelope
confronted
her
the
sight
of
it
was
distasteful
the
indorsed
side
lay
uppermost
and
the
words
seemed
like
a
mute
reproach
the
last
will
and
testament
of
samuel
merkell
snatching
up
the
envelope
she
glanced
into
it
mechanically
as
she
moved
toward
the
next
room
and
perceived
a
thin
folded
paper
which
had
heretofore
escaped
her
notice
when
opened
it
proved
to
be
a
certificate
of
marriage
in
due
form
between
samuel
merkell
and
julia
brown
it
was
dated
from
a
county
in
south
carolina
about
two
years
before
her
father
death
for
a
moment
carteret
stood
gazing
blankly
at
this
faded
slip
of
paper
her
father
married
this
woman
at
least
he
had
gone
through
the
form
of
marriage
with
her
for
to
him
it
had
surely
been
no
more
than
an
empty
formality
the
marriage
of
white
and
colored
persons
was
forbidden
by
law
only
recently
she
had
read
of
a
case
where
both
the
parties
to
such
a
crime
a
colored
man
and
a
white
woman
had
been
sentenced
to
long
terms
in
the
penitentiary
she
even
recalled
the
circumstances
the
couple
had
been
living
together
unlawfully
they
were
very
low
people
whose
private
lives
were
beneath
the
public
notice
but
influenced
by
a
religious
movement
pervading
the
community
had
sought
they
said
at
the
trial
to
secure
the
blessing
of
god
upon
their
union
the
higher
law
which
imperiously
demanded
that
the
purity
and
prestige
of
the
white
race
be
preserved
at
any
cost
had
intervened
at
this
point
mechanically
she
moved
toward
the
fireplace
so
dazed
by
this
discovery
as
to
be
scarcely
conscious
of
her
own
actions
she
surely
had
not
formed
any
definite
intention
of
destroying
this
piece
of
paper
when
her
fingers
relaxed
unconsciously
and
let
go
their
hold
upon
it
the
draught
swept
it
toward
the
fireplace
ere
scarcely
touching
the
flames
it
caught
blazed
fiercely
and
shot
upward
with
the
current
of
air
a
moment
later
the
record
of
poor
julia
marriage
was
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
as
her
poor
body
had
long
since
mingled
with
the
dust
of
earth
the
letter
remained
unread
in
her
agitation
at
the
discovery
of
the
marriage
certificate
olivia
had
almost
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
letter
it
was
addressed
to
john
delamere
as
executor
of
my
last
will
and
testament
while
the
lower
left
hand
corner
bore
the
direction
to
be
delivered
only
after
my
death
with
seal
unbroken
the
seal
was
broken
already
delamere
was
dead
the
letter
could
never
be
delivered
carteret
unfolded
it
and
read
my
dear
delamere
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
naming
you
as
executor
of
my
last
will
because
you
are
my
friend
and
the
only
man
of
my
acquaintance
whom
i
feel
that
i
can
trust
to
carry
out
my
wishes
appreciate
my
motives
and
preserve
the
silence
i
desire
i
have
first
a
confession
to
make
inclosed
in
this
letter
you
will
find
a
certificate
of
marriage
between
my
child
janet
mother
and
myself
while
i
have
never
exactly
repented
of
this
marriage
i
have
never
had
the
courage
to
acknowledge
it
openly
if
i
had
not
married
julia
i
fear
polly
ochiltree
would
have
married
me
by
main
force
as
she
would
marry
you
or
any
other
gentleman
unfortunate
enough
to
fall
in
the
way
of
this
when
my
wife
died
three
years
ago
her
sister
polly
offered
to
keep
house
for
me
and
the
child
i
would
sooner
have
had
the
devil
in
the
house
and
yet
i
trembled
with
alarm
there
seemed
no
way
of
escape
it
was
so
clearly
and
obviously
the
proper
thing
but
she
herself
gave
me
my
opportunity
i
was
on
the
point
of
consenting
when
she
demanded
as
a
condition
of
her
coming
that
i
discharge
julia
my
late
wife
maid
she
was
laboring
under
a
misapprehension
in
regard
to
the
girl
but
i
grasped
at
the
straw
and
did
everything
to
foster
her
delusion
i
declared
solemnly
that
nothing
under
heaven
would
induce
me
to
part
with
julia
the
controversy
resulted
in
my
permitting
polly
to
take
the
child
while
i
retained
the
maid
before
polly
put
this
idea
into
my
head
i
had
scarcely
looked
at
julia
but
this
outbreak
turned
my
attention
toward
her
she
was
a
handsome
girl
and
as
i
soon
found
out
a
good
girl
my
wife
who
raised
her
was
a
christian
woman
and
had
taught
her
modesty
and
virtue
she
was
free
the
air
was
full
of
liberty
and
equal
rights
and
all
the
abolition
claptrap
and
she
made
marriage
a
condition
of
her
remaining
longer
in
the
house
in
a
moment
of
weakness
i
took
her
away
to
a
place
where
we
were
not
known
and
married
her
if
she
had
left
me
i
should
have
fallen
a
victim
to
polly
ochiltree
to
which
any
fate
was
preferable
and
then
old
friend
my
weakness
kept
to
the
fore
i
was
ashamed
of
this
marriage
and
my
new
wife
saw
it
moreover
she
loved
me
too
well
indeed
to
wish
to
make
me
unhappy
the
ceremony
had
satisfied
her
conscience
had
set
her
right
she
said
with
god
for
the
opinions
of
men
she
did
not
care
since
i
loved
her
she
only
wanted
to
compensate
me
as
best
she
could
for
the
great
honor
i
had
done
my
handmaiden
for
she
had
read
her
bible
and
i
was
the
abraham
to
her
hagar
compared
with
whom
she
considered
herself
at
a
great
advantage
it
was
her
own
proposition
that
nothing
be
said
of
this
marriage
if
any
shame
should
fall
on
her
it
would
fall
lightly
for
it
would
be
undeserved
when
the
child
came
she
still
kept
silence
no
one
she
argued
could
blame
an
innocent
child
for
the
accident
of
birth
and
in
the
sight
of
god
this
child
had
every
right
to
exist
while
among
her
own
people
illegitimacy
would
involve
but
little
stigma
i
need
not
say
that
i
was
easily
persuaded
to
accept
this
sacrifice
but
touched
by
her
fidelity
i
swore
to
provide
handsomely
for
them
both
this
i
have
tried
to
do
by
the
will
of
which
i
ask
you
to
act
as
executor
had
i
left
the
child
more
it
might
serve
as
a
ground
for
attacking
the
will
my
acknowledgment
of
the
tie
of
blood
is
sufficient
to
justify
a
reasonable
bequest
i
have
taken
this
course
for
the
sake
of
my
daughter
olivia
who
is
dear
to
me
and
whom
i
would
not
wish
to
make
ashamed
and
in
deference
to
public
opinion
which
it
is
not
easy
to
defy
if
after
my
death
julia
should
choose
to
make
our
secret
known
i
shall
of
course
be
beyond
the
reach
of
hard
words
but
loyalty
to
my
memory
will
probably
keep
her
silent
a
strong
man
would
long
since
have
acknowledged
her
before
the
world
and
taken
the
consequences
but
alas
i
am
only
myself
and
the
atmosphere
i
live
in
does
not
encourage
moral
heroism
i
should
like
to
be
different
but
it
is
god
who
hath
made
us
and
not
we
ourselves
nevertheless
old
friend
i
will
ask
of
you
one
favor
if
in
the
future
this
child
of
julia
and
of
mine
should
grow
to
womanhood
if
she
should
prove
to
have
her
mother
gentleness
and
love
of
virtue
if
in
the
new
era
which
is
opening
up
for
her
mother
race
to
which
unfortunately
she
must
belong
she
should
become
in
time
an
educated
woman
and
if
the
time
should
ever
come
when
by
virtue
of
her
education
or
the
development
of
her
people
it
would
be
to
her
a
source
of
shame
or
unhappiness
that
she
was
an
illegitimate
child
if
you
are
still
alive
old
friend
and
have
the
means
of
knowing
or
divining
this
thing
go
to
her
and
tell
her
for
me
that
she
is
my
lawful
child
and
ask
her
to
forgive
her
father
weakness
when
this
letter
comes
to
you
i
shall
have
passed
to
the
beyond
but
i
am
confident
that
you
will
accept
this
trust
for
which
i
thank
you
now
in
advance
most
heartily
the
letter
was
signed
with
her
father
name
the
same
signature
which
had
been
attached
to
the
will
having
firmly
convinced
herself
of
the
illegality
of
the
papers
and
of
her
own
right
to
destroy
them
carteret
ought
to
have
felt
relieved
that
she
had
thus
removed
all
traces
of
her
dead
father
folly
true
the
other
daughter
remained
she
had
seen
her
on
the
street
only
the
day
before
the
sight
of
this
person
she
had
always
found
offensive
and
now
she
felt
in
view
of
what
she
had
just
learned
it
must
be
even
more
so
never
while
this
woman
lived
in
the
town
would
she
be
able
to
throw
the
veil
of
forgetfulness
over
this
blot
upon
her
father
memory
as
the
day
wore
on
carteret
grew
still
less
at
ease
to
herself
marriage
was
a
serious
thing
to
a
woman
the
most
serious
concern
of
life
a
marriage
certificate
rightfully
procured
was
scarcely
less
solemn
so
far
as
it
went
than
the
bible
itself
her
own
she
cherished
as
the
apple
of
her
eye
it
was
the
evidence
of
her
wifehood
the
seal
of
her
child
legitimacy
her
patent
of
nobility
the
token
of
her
own
and
her
child
claim
to
social
place
and
consideration
she
had
burned
this
pretended
marriage
certificate
because
it
meant
nothing
nevertheless
she
could
not
ignore
the
knowledge
of
another
such
marriage
of
which
every
one
in
the
town
knew
a
celebrated
case
indeed
where
a
white
man
of
a
family
quite
as
prominent
as
her
father
had
married
a
colored
woman
during
the
military
occupation
of
the
state
just
after
the
civil
war
the
legality
of
the
marriage
had
never
been
questioned
it
had
been
fully
consummated
by
twenty
years
of
subsequent
cohabitation
no
amount
of
social
persecution
had
ever
shaken
the
position
of
the
husband
with
an
iron
will
he
had
stayed
on
in
the
town
a
living
protest
against
the
established
customs
of
the
south
so
rudely
interrupted
for
a
few
short
years
and
though
his
children
were
negroes
though
he
had
never
appeared
in
public
with
his
wife
no
one
had
ever
questioned
the
validity
of
his
marriage
or
the
legitimacy
of
his
offspring
the
marriage
certificate
which
carteret
had
burned
dated
from
the
period
of
the
military
occupation
hence
carteret
who
was
a
good
woman
and
would
not
have
done
a
dishonest
thing
felt
decidedly
uncomfortable
she
had
destroyed
the
marriage
certificate
but
its
ghost
still
haunted
her
major
carteret
having
just
eaten
a
good
dinner
was
in
a
very
agreeable
humor
when
that
same
evening
his
wife
brought
up
again
the
subject
of
their
previous
discussion
phil
she
asked
aunt
polly
told
me
that
once
long
before
my
father
died
when
she
went
to
remonstrate
with
him
for
keeping
that
woman
in
the
house
he
threatened
to
marry
julia
if
aunt
polly
ever
said
another
word
to
him
about
the
matter
suppose
he
married
her
and
had
then
left
a
will
would
the
marriage
have
made
any
difference
so
far
as
the
will
was
concerned
major
carteret
laughed
your
aunt
polly
he
said
was
a
remarkable
woman
with
a
wonderful
imagination
which
seems
to
have
grown
more
vivid
as
her
memory
and
judgment
weakened
why
should
your
father
marry
his
negro
housemaid
merkell
was
never
rated
as
a
fool
he
had
one
of
the
clearest
heads
in
wellington
i
saw
him
only
a
day
or
two
before
he
died
and
i
could
swear
before
any
court
in
christendom
that
he
was
of
sound
mind
and
memory
to
the
last
these
notions
of
your
aunt
were
mere
delusions
your
father
was
never
capable
of
such
a
folly
of
course
i
am
only
supposing
a
case
returned
olivia
imagining
such
a
case
just
for
the
argument
would
the
marriage
have
been
legal
that
would
depend
if
he
had
married
her
during
the
military
occupation
or
over
in
south
carolina
the
marriage
would
have
been
legally
valid
though
morally
and
socially
outrageous
and
if
he
had
died
afterwards
leaving
a
will
the
will
would
have
controlled
the
disposition
of
his
estate
in
all
probability
suppose
he
had
left
no
will
you
are
getting
the
matter
down
pretty
fine
my
dear
the
woman
would
have
taken
one
third
of
the
real
estate
for
life
and
could
have
lived
in
the
homestead
until
she
died
she
would
also
have
had
half
the
other
property
the
money
and
goods
and
furniture
everything
except
the
land
and
the
negro
child
would
have
shared
with
you
the
balance
of
the
estate
that
i
believe
is
according
to
the
law
of
descent
and
distribution
carteret
lapsed
into
a
troubled
silence
her
father
married
the
woman
in
her
heart
she
had
no
doubt
of
the
validity
of
the
marriage
so
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
if
one
marriage
of
such
a
kind
would
stand
another
contracted
under
similar
conditions
was
equally
as
good
if
the
marriage
had
been
valid
julia
child
had
been
legitimate
the
will
she
had
burned
gave
this
sister
of
hers
she
shuddered
at
the
word
but
a
small
part
of
the
estate
under
the
law
which
intervened
now
that
there
was
no
will
the
property
should
have
been
equally
divided
if
the
woman
had
been
white
but
the
woman
had
been
white
and
the
same
rule
of
moral
conduct
did
not
not
in
the
very
nature
of
things
apply
as
between
white
people
for
if
this
were
not
so
slavery
had
been
not
merely
an
economic
mistake
but
a
great
crime
against
humanity
if
it
had
been
such
a
crime
as
for
a
moment
she
dimly
perceived
it
might
have
been
then
through
the
long
centuries
there
had
been
piled
up
a
catalogue
of
wrong
and
outrage
which
if
the
law
of
compensation
be
a
law
of
nature
must
some
time
somewhere
in
some
way
be
atoned
for
she
herself
had
not
escaped
the
penalty
of
which
she
realized
this
burden
placed
upon
her
conscience
was
but
another
installment
if
she
should
make
known
the
facts
she
had
learned
it
would
mean
what
a
division
of
her
father
estate
a
recognition
of
the
legality
of
her
father
relations
with
julia
such
a
stain
upon
her
memory
would
be
infinitely
worse
than
if
he
had
married
her
to
have
lived
with
her
without
marriage
was
a
social
misdemeanor
at
which
society
in
the
old
days
had
winked
or
at
most
had
frowned
to
have
married
her
was
to
have
committed
the
unpardonable
social
sin
such
a
scandal
carteret
could
not
have
endured
should
she
seek
to
make
restitution
it
would
necessarily
involve
the
disclosure
of
at
least
some
of
the
facts
had
she
not
destroyed
the
will
she
might
have
compromised
with
her
conscience
by
producing
it
and
acting
upon
its
terms
which
had
been
so
stated
as
not
to
disclose
the
marriage
this
was
now
rendered
impossible
by
her
own
impulsive
act
she
could
not
mention
the
will
at
all
without
admitting
that
she
had
destroyed
it
carteret
found
herself
in
what
might
be
called
vulgarly
a
moral
pocket
she
could
of
course
remain
silent
carteret
was
a
good
woman
according
to
her
lights
with
a
cultivated
conscience
to
which
she
had
always
looked
as
her
mentor
and
infallible
guide
hence
carteret
after
this
painful
discovery
remained
for
a
long
time
ill
at
ease
so
disturbed
indeed
that
her
mind
reacted
upon
her
nerves
which
had
never
been
strong
and
her
nervousness
affected
her
strength
which
had
never
been
great
until
carteret
whose
love
for
her
had
been
deepened
and
strengthened
by
the
advent
of
his
son
became
alarmed
for
her
health
and
spoke
very
seriously
to
price
concerning
it
xxxi
the
shadow
of
a
dream
carteret
awoke
with
a
start
from
a
troubled
dream
she
had
been
sailing
across
a
sunlit
sea
in
a
beautiful
boat
her
child
lying
on
a
cushion
at
her
feet
overhead
the
swelling
sail
served
as
an
awning
to
keep
off
the
sun
rays
which
far
ahead
were
reflected
with
dazzling
brilliancy
from
the
shores
of
a
golden
island
her
son
she
dreamed
was
a
fairy
prince
and
yonder
lay
his
kingdom
to
which
he
was
being
borne
lying
there
at
her
feet
in
this
beautiful
boat
across
the
sunlit
sea
suddenly
and
without
warning
the
sky
was
overcast
a
squall
struck
the
boat
and
tore
away
the
sail
in
the
distance
a
huge
billow
a
great
white
wall
of
water
came
sweeping
toward
their
frail
craft
threatening
it
with
instant
destruction
she
clasped
her
child
to
her
bosom
and
a
moment
later
found
herself
struggling
in
the
sea
holding
the
head
above
the
water
as
she
floated
there
as
though
sustained
by
some
unseen
force
she
saw
in
the
distance
a
small
boat
approaching
over
the
waves
straight
toward
her
it
came
and
she
had
reached
out
her
hand
to
grasp
its
side
when
the
rower
looked
back
and
she
saw
that
it
was
her
sister
the
recognition
had
been
mutual
with
a
sharp
movement
of
one
oar
the
boat
glided
by
leaving
her
clutching
at
the
empty
air
she
felt
her
strength
begin
to
fail
despairingly
she
signaled
with
her
disengaged
hand
but
the
rower
after
one
mute
reproachful
glance
rowed
on
carteret
strength
grew
less
and
less
the
child
became
heavy
as
lead
herself
floating
in
the
water
as
though
it
were
her
native
element
she
could
no
longer
support
the
child
lower
and
lower
it
sank
she
was
powerless
to
save
it
or
to
accompany
it
until
gasping
wildly
for
breath
it
threw
up
its
little
hands
and
sank
the
cruel
water
gurgling
over
its
head
when
she
awoke
with
a
start
and
a
chill
and
lay
there
trembling
for
several
minutes
before
she
heard
little
dodie
in
his
crib
breathing
heavily
she
rose
softly
went
to
the
crib
and
changed
the
child
position
to
an
easier
one
he
breathed
more
freely
and
she
went
back
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
she
had
tried
to
put
aside
the
distressing
questions
raised
by
the
discovery
of
her
father
will
and
the
papers
accompanying
it
why
should
she
be
burdened
with
such
a
responsibility
at
this
late
day
when
the
touch
of
time
had
healed
these
old
sores
surely
god
had
put
his
curse
not
alone
upon
the
slave
but
upon
the
stealer
of
men
with
other
good
people
she
had
thanked
him
that
slavery
was
no
more
and
that
those
who
once
had
borne
its
burden
upon
their
consciences
could
stand
erect
and
feel
that
they
themselves
were
free
the
weed
had
been
cut
down
but
its
roots
remained
deeply
imbedded
in
the
soil
to
spring
up
and
trouble
a
new
generation
upon
her
weak
shoulders
was
placed
the
burden
of
her
father
weakness
her
father
folly
it
was
left
to
her
to
acknowledge
or
not
this
shameful
marriage
and
her
sister
rights
in
their
father
estate
balancing
one
consideration
against
another
she
had
almost
decided
that
she
might
ignore
this
tie
to
herself
olivia
merkell
olivia
carteret
the
stigma
of
base
birth
would
have
meant
social
ostracism
social
ruin
the
averted
face
the
finger
of
pity
or
of
scorn
all
the
traditional
weight
of
public
disapproval
would
have
fallen
upon
her
as
the
unhappy
fruit
of
an
unblessed
union
to
this
other
woman
it
could
have
had
no
such
significance
it
had
been
the
lot
of
her
race
to
them
years
before
sexual
sin
had
never
been
imputed
as
more
than
a
fault
she
had
lost
nothing
by
her
supposed
illegitimacy
she
would
gain
nothing
by
the
acknowledgment
of
her
mother
marriage
on
the
other
hand
what
would
be
the
effect
of
this
revelation
upon
carteret
herself
to
have
it
known
that
her
father
had
married
a
negress
would
only
be
less
dreadful
than
to
have
it
appear
that
he
had
committed
some
terrible
crime
it
was
a
crime
now
by
the
laws
of
every
southern
state
for
white
and
colored
persons
to
intermarry
she
shuddered
before
the
possibility
that
at
some
time
in
the
future
some
person
none
too
well
informed
might
learn
that
her
father
had
married
a
colored
woman
and
might
assume
that
she
olivia
carteret
or
her
child
had
sprung
from
this
shocking
a
fate
to
which
she
would
willingly
have
preferred
death
no
this
marriage
must
never
be
made
known
the
secret
should
remain
buried
forever
in
her
own
heart
but
there
still
remained
the
question
of
her
father
property
and
her
father
will
this
woman
was
her
father
child
of
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
written
in
her
features
no
less
than
in
her
will
as
his
lawful
child
of
which
alas
there
could
also
be
no
question
she
was
entitled
by
law
to
half
his
estate
problem
had
sunk
from
the
realm
of
sentiment
to
that
of
material
things
which
curiously
enough
she
found
much
more
difficult
for
while
the
negro
by
the
traditions
of
her
people
was
barred
from
the
world
of
sentiment
his
rights
of
property
were
recognized
the
question
had
become
with
carteret
a
question
of
and
had
the
girl
janet
been
poor
ignorant
or
degraded
as
might
well
have
been
her
fate
carteret
might
have
felt
a
vicarious
remorse
for
her
suppression
of
the
papers
but
fate
had
compensated
janet
for
the
loss
she
had
been
educated
she
had
married
well
she
had
not
suffered
for
lack
of
the
money
of
which
she
had
been
defrauded
and
did
not
need
it
now
she
had
a
child
it
is
true
but
this
child
career
would
be
so
circumscribed
by
the
accident
of
color
that
too
much
wealth
would
only
be
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
her
own
child
on
the
contrary
it
would
open
every
door
of
life
it
would
be
too
lengthy
a
task
to
follow
the
mind
and
conscience
of
this
lady
in
their
intricate
workings
upon
this
difficult
problem
for
she
had
a
mind
as
logical
as
any
woman
and
a
conscience
which
she
wished
to
keep
void
of
offense
she
had
to
confront
a
situation
involving
the
element
of
race
upon
which
the
moral
standards
of
her
people
were
hopelessly
confused
carteret
reached
the
conclusion
ere
daylight
dawned
that
she
would
be
silent
upon
the
subject
of
her
father
second
marriage
neither
party
had
wished
it
known
neither
julia
nor
her
father
and
she
would
respect
her
father
wishes
to
act
otherwise
would
be
to
defeat
his
will
to
make
known
what
he
had
carefully
concealed
and
to
give
janet
a
claim
of
title
to
one
half
her
father
estate
while
he
had
only
meant
her
to
have
the
ten
thousand
dollars
named
in
the
will
by
the
same
reasoning
she
must
carry
out
her
father
will
in
respect
to
this
bequest
here
there
was
another
difficulty
the
mining
investment
into
which
they
had
entered
shortly
after
the
birth
of
little
dodie
had
tied
up
so
much
of
her
property
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
procure
ten
thousand
dollars
immediately
while
a
demand
for
half
the
property
at
once
would
mean
bankruptcy
and
ruin
moreover
upon
what
ground
could
she
offer
her
sister
any
sum
of
money
whatever
so
sudden
a
change
of
heart
after
so
many
years
of
silence
would
raise
the
presumption
of
some
right
on
the
part
of
janet
in
her
estate
suspicion
once
aroused
it
might
be
possible
to
trace
this
hidden
marriage
and
establish
it
by
legal
proof
the
marriage
once
verified
the
claim
for
half
the
estate
could
not
be
denied
she
could
not
plead
her
father
will
to
the
contrary
for
this
would
be
to
acknowledge
the
suppression
of
the
will
in
itself
a
criminal
act
there
was
however
a
way
of
escape
this
hospital
which
had
recently
been
opened
was
the
personal
property
of
her
sister
husband
some
time
in
the
future
when
their
investments
matured
she
would
present
to
the
hospital
a
sum
of
money
equal
to
the
amount
her
father
had
meant
his
colored
daughter
to
have
thus
indirectly
both
her
father
will
and
her
own
conscience
would
be
satisfied
carteret
had
reached
this
comfortable
conclusion
and
was
falling
asleep
when
her
attention
was
again
drawn
by
her
child
breathing
she
took
it
in
her
own
arms
and
soon
fell
asleep
by
the
way
olivia
said
the
major
when
leaving
the
house
next
morning
for
the
office
if
you
have
any
business
down
town
transact
it
this
forenoon
under
no
circumstances
must
you
or
clara
or
the
baby
leave
the
house
after
midday
why
what
the
matter
phil
nothing
to
alarm
you
except
that
there
may
be
a
little
political
demonstration
which
may
render
the
streets
unsafe
you
are
not
to
say
anything
about
it
where
the
servants
might
hear
will
there
be
any
danger
for
you
phil
she
demanded
with
alarm
not
the
slightest
olivia
dear
no
one
will
be
harmed
but
it
is
best
for
ladies
and
children
to
stay
indoors
carteret
nerves
were
still
more
or
less
unstrung
from
her
mental
struggles
of
the
night
and
the
memory
of
her
dream
came
to
her
like
a
dim
foreboding
of
misfortune
as
though
in
sympathy
with
its
feelings
the
baby
did
not
seem
as
well
as
usual
the
new
nurse
was
by
no
means
an
ideal
nurse
mammy
jane
understood
the
child
much
better
if
there
should
be
any
trouble
with
the
negroes
toward
which
her
husband
remark
seemed
to
point
she
knew
the
general
political
situation
though
not
informed
in
regard
to
her
husband
plans
she
would
like
to
have
mammy
jane
near
her
where
the
old
nurse
might
be
protected
from
danger
or
alarm
with
this
end
in
view
she
dispatched
the
nurse
shortly
after
breakfast
to
mammy
jane
house
in
the
negro
settlement
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
with
a
message
asking
the
old
woman
to
come
immediately
to
carteret
unfortunately
mammy
jane
had
gone
to
visit
a
sick
woman
in
the
country
and
was
not
expected
to
return
for
several
hours
xxxii
the
storm
breaks
the
wellington
riot
began
at
three
in
the
afternoon
of
a
day
as
fair
as
was
ever
selected
for
a
deed
of
darkness
the
sky
was
clear
except
for
a
few
light
clouds
that
floated
white
and
feathery
high
in
air
like
distant
islands
in
a
sapphire
sea
a
breeze
from
the
ocean
a
few
miles
away
lent
a
crisp
sparkle
to
the
air
at
three
sharp
the
streets
were
filled
as
if
by
magic
with
armed
white
men
the
negroes
going
about
had
noted
with
uneasy
curiosity
that
the
stores
and
places
of
business
many
of
which
closed
at
noon
were
unduly
late
in
opening
for
the
afternoon
though
no
one
suspected
the
reason
for
the
delay
but
at
three
every
passing
colored
man
was
ordered
by
the
first
white
man
he
met
to
throw
up
his
hands
if
he
complied
he
was
searched
more
or
less
roughly
for
firearms
and
then
warned
to
get
off
the
street
when
he
met
another
group
of
white
men
the
scene
was
repeated
the
man
thus
summarily
held
up
seldom
encountered
more
than
two
groups
before
disappearing
across
lots
to
his
own
home
or
some
convenient
if
he
resisted
any
demand
of
those
who
halted
him
but
the
records
of
the
day
are
historical
they
may
be
found
in
the
newspapers
of
the
following
date
but
they
are
more
firmly
engraved
upon
the
hearts
and
memories
of
the
people
of
wellington
for
many
months
there
were
negro
families
in
the
town
whose
children
screamed
with
fear
and
ran
to
their
mothers
for
protection
at
the
mere
sight
of
a
white
man
miller
had
received
a
call
about
one
to
attend
a
case
at
the
house
of
a
colored
farmer
who
lived
some
three
or
four
miles
from
the
town
upon
the
very
road
by
the
way
along
which
miller
had
driven
so
furiously
a
few
weeks
before
in
the
few
hours
that
intervened
before
sandy
campbell
would
probably
have
been
burned
at
the
stake
the
drive
to
his
patient
home
the
necessary
inquiries
the
filling
of
the
prescription
from
his
own
which
he
carried
along
with
him
the
little
friendly
conversation
about
the
weather
and
the
crops
and
the
farmer
being
an
intelligent
and
thinking
man
the
inevitable
subject
of
the
future
of
their
race
these
added
to
the
return
journey
occupied
at
least
two
hours
of
miller
time
as
he
neared
the
town
on
his
way
back
he
saw
ahead
of
him
half
a
dozen
men
and
women
approaching
with
fear
written
in
their
faces
in
every
degree
from
apprehension
to
terror
women
were
weeping
and
children
crying
and
all
were
going
as
fast
as
seemingly
lay
in
their
power
looking
behind
now
and
then
as
if
pursued
by
some
deadly
enemy
at
sight
of
miller
buggy
they
made
a
dash
for
cover
disappearing
like
a
covey
of
frightened
partridges
in
the
underbrush
along
the
road
miller
pulled
up
his
horse
and
looked
after
them
in
startled
wonder
what
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
he
muttered
struck
with
a
vague
feeling
of
alarm
a
psychologist
seeking
to
trace
the
effects
of
slavery
upon
the
human
mind
might
find
in
the
south
many
a
curious
illustration
of
this
curse
abiding
long
after
the
actual
physical
bondage
had
terminated
in
the
olden
time
the
white
south
labored
under
the
constant
fear
of
negro
insurrections
knowing
that
they
themselves
if
in
the
negroes
place
would
have
risen
in
the
effort
to
throw
off
the
yoke
all
their
reiterated
theories
of
negro
subordination
and
inferiority
could
not
remove
that
lurking
fear
founded
upon
the
obscure
consciousness
that
the
slaves
ought
to
have
risen
conscience
it
has
been
said
makes
cowards
of
us
all
there
was
never
on
the
continent
of
america
a
successful
slave
revolt
nor
one
which
lasted
more
than
a
few
hours
or
resulted
in
the
loss
of
more
than
a
few
white
lives
yet
never
was
the
planter
quite
free
from
the
fear
that
there
might
be
one
on
the
other
hand
the
slave
had
before
his
eyes
always
the
fear
of
the
master
there
were
good
men
according
to
their
lights
according
to
their
training
and
environment
among
the
southern
slaveholders
who
treated
their
slaves
kindly
as
slaves
from
principle
because
they
recognized
the
claims
of
humanity
even
under
the
dark
skin
of
a
human
chattel
there
was
many
a
one
who
protected
or
pampered
his
negroes
as
the
case
might
be
just
as
a
man
fondles
his
dog
because
they
were
his
they
were
a
part
of
his
estate
an
integral
part
of
the
entity
of
property
and
person
which
made
up
the
aristocrat
but
with
all
this
kindness
there
was
always
present
in
the
consciousness
of
the
lowest
slave
the
knowledge
that
he
was
in
his
master
power
and
that
he
could
make
no
effectual
protest
against
the
abuse
of
that
authority
there
was
also
the
knowledge
among
those
who
could
think
at
all
that
the
best
of
masters
was
himself
a
slave
to
a
system
which
hampered
his
movements
but
scarcely
less
than
those
of
his
bondmen
when
therefore
miller
saw
these
men
and
women
scampering
into
the
bushes
he
divined
with
this
slumbering
race
consciousness
which
years
of
culture
had
not
obliterated
that
there
was
some
race
trouble
on
foot
his
intuition
did
not
long
remain
unsupported
a
black
head
was
cautiously
protruded
from
the
shrubbery
and
a
black
voice
if
such
a
description
be
allowable
addressed
him
is
dat
you
doctuh
miller
yes
who
are
you
and
what
the
trouble
what
de
trouble
suh
why
all

yonduh
de

an

lay
han
on
miller
heart
leaped
to
his
throat
as
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
child
this
story
was
preposterous
it
could
not
be
true
and
yet
there
must
be
something
in
it
he
tried
to
question
his
informant
but
the
man
was
so
overcome
with
excitement
and
fear
that
miller
saw
clearly
that
he
must
go
farther
for
information
he
had
read
in
the
morning
chronicle
a
few
days
before
the
obnoxious
editorial
quoted
from
the
banner
and
had
noted
the
comment
upon
it
by
the
white
editor
he
had
felt
as
at
the
time
of
its
first
publication
that
the
editorial
was
it
could
do
no
good
and
was
calculated
to
arouse
the
animosity
of
those
whose
friendship
whose
tolerance
at
least
was
necessary
and
almost
indispensable
to
the
colored
people
they
were
living
at
the
best
in
a
sort
of
armed
neutrality
with
the
whites
such
a
publication
however
serviceable
elsewhere
could
have
no
other
effect
in
wellington
than
to
endanger
this
truce
and
defeat
the
hope
of
a
possible
future
friendship
the
right
of
free
speech
entitled
barber
to
publish
it
a
larger
measure
of
would
have
made
him
withhold
it
whether
it
was
the
republication
of
this
article
that
had
stirred
up
anew
the
sleeping
dogs
of
race
prejudice
and
whetted
their
thirst
for
blood
he
could
not
yet
tell
but
at
any
rate
there
was
mischief
on
foot
fer
god
sake
doctuh
don

his

till

man
exclaimed
miller
urging
his
horse
forward
my
wife
and
child
are
in
the
town
fortunately
he
reflected
there
were
no
patients
confined
in
the
hospital
if
there
should
be
anything
in
this
preposterous
story
to
one
unfamiliar
with
southern
life
it
might
have
seemed
impossible
that
these
good
christian
people
who
thronged
the
churches
on
sunday
and
wept
over
the
sufferings
of
the
lowly
nazarene
and
sent
missionaries
to
the
heathen
could
be
hungering
and
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
their
fellow
men
but
miller
cherished
no
such
delusion
he
knew
the
history
of
his
country
he
had
the
threatened
lynching
of
sandy
campbell
vividly
in
mind
and
he
was
fully
persuaded
that
to
race
prejudice
once
roused
any
horror
was
possible
that
women
or
children
would
be
molested
of
set
purpose
he
did
not
believe
but
that
they
might
suffer
by
accident
was
more
than
likely
as
he
neared
the
town
dashing
forward
at
the
top
of
his
horse
speed
he
heard
his
voice
called
in
a
loud
and
agitated
tone
and
glancing
around
him
saw
a
familiar
form
standing
by
the
roadside
gesticulating
vehemently
he
drew
up
the
horse
with
a
suddenness
that
threw
the
faithful
and
obedient
animal
back
upon
its
haunches
the
colored
lawyer
watson
came
up
to
the
buggy
that
he
was
laboring
under
great
and
unusual
excitement
was
quite
apparent
from
his
pale
face
and
frightened
air
what
the
matter
watson
demanded
miller
hoping
now
to
obtain
some
reliable
information
matter
exclaimed
the
other
everything
the
matter
the
white
people
are
up
in
arms
they
have
disarmed
the
colored
people
killing
half
a
dozen
in
the
process
and
wounding
as
many
more
they
have
forced
the
mayor
and
aldermen
to
resign
have
formed
a
provisional
city
government
la
and
have
ordered
me
and
half
a
dozen
other
fellows
to
leave
town
in
hours
under
pain
of
sudden
death
as
they
seem
to
mean
it
i
shall
not
stay
so
long
fortunately
my
wife
and
children
are
away
i
knew
you
were
out
here
however
and
i
thought
i
come
out
and
wait
for
you
so
that
we
might
talk
the
matter
over
i
do
imagine
they
mean
you
any
harm
personally
because
you
tread
on
nobody
toes
but
you
too
valuable
a
man
for
the
race
to
lose
so
i
thought
i
give
you
warning
i
shall
want
to
sell
you
my
property
too
at
a
bargain
for
i
worth
too
much
to
my
family
to
dream
of
ever
attempting
to
live
here
again
have
you
seen
anything
of
my
wife
and
child
asked
miller
intent
upon
the
danger
to
which
they
might
be
exposed
no
i
did
go
to
the
house
i
inquired
at
the
drugstore
and
found
out
where
you
had
gone
you
need
fear
for
them
it
is
not
a
war
on
women
and
children
war
of
any
kind
is
always
hardest
on
the
women
and
children
returned
miller
i
must
hurry
on
and
see
that
mine
are
safe
they
not
carry
the
war
so
far
into
africa
as
that
returned
watson
but
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
yesterday
i
had
a
hundred
white
friends
in
the
town
or
thought
i
had
men
who
spoke
pleasantly
to
me
on
the
street
and
sometimes
gave
me
their
hands
to
shake
not
one
of
them
said
to
me
today
stay
at
home
this
afternoon
i
might
have
been
killed
like
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
others
who
have
bit
the
dust
for
any
word
that
one
of
my
had
said
to
warn
me
when
the
race
cry
is
started
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
friendship
religion
humanity
reason
all
shrivel
up
like
dry
leaves
in
a
raging
furnace
the
buggy
into
which
watson
had
climbed
was
meanwhile
rapidly
nearing
the
town
i
think
i
leave
you
here
miller
said
watson
as
they
approached
the
outskirts
and
make
my
way
home
by
a
roundabout
path
as
i
should
like
to
get
there
unmolested
home
a
beautiful
word
that
is
it
for
an
exiled
wanderer
it
might
not
be
well
either
for
us
to
be
seen
together
if
you
put
the
hood
of
your
buggy
down
and
sit
well
back
in
the
shadow
you
may
be
able
to
reach
home
without
interruption
but
avoid
the
main
streets
i
see
you
again
this
evening
if
we
both
alive
and
i
can
reach
you
for
my
time
is
short
a
committee
are
to
call
in
the
morning
to
escort
me
to
the
train
i
am
to
be
dismissed
from
the
community
with
public
honors
watson
was
climbing
down
from
the
buggy
when
a
small
party
of
men
were
seen
approaching
and
big
josh
green
followed
by
several
other
colored
men
came
up
and
addressed
them
miller
cried

watson
despairingly

it
is
my
duty
to

for

if

i

no
glory
and
no

and
my
family
would
be
reduced
to
beggary
to
which
soon
be
near
enough
as
it
is
this
affair
will
blow
over
in
a
day
or
two
the
white
people
will
be
ashamed
of
themselves
and
apprehensive
of
the
consequences
for
some
time
to
come
keep
quiet
boys
and
trust
in
god
you
wo
gain
anything
by
resistance
dem
dat
demselves
returned
josh
stoutly
ef
watson
wo
lead
us
will
you
dr
miller
said
the
spokesman
turning
to
the
doctor
for
miller
it
was
an
agonizing
moment
he
was
no
coward
morally
or
physically
every
manly
instinct
urged
him
to
go
forward
and
take
up
the
cause
of
these
leaderless
people
and
if
need
be
to
defend
their
lives
and
their
rights
with
his
own
but
to
what
end
listen
men
he
said
we
would
only
be
throwing
our
lives
away
suppose
we
made
a
determined
stand
and
won
a
temporary
victory
by
morning
every
train
every
boat
every
road
leading
into
wellington
would
be
crowded
with
white
men
as
they
probably
will
be
any
way
with
arms
in
their
hands
curses
on
their
lips
and
vengeance
in
their
hearts
in
the
minds
of
those
who
make
and
administer
the
laws
we
have
no
standing
in
the
court
of
conscience
they
would
kill
us
in
the
fight
or
they
would
hang
us
afterwards
one
way
or
another
we
should
be
doomed
i
should
like
to
lead
you
i
should
like
to
arm
every
colored
man
in
this
town
and
have
them
stand
firmly
in
line
not
for
attack
but
for
defense
but
if
i
attempted
it
and
they
should
stand
by
me
which
is
questionable
for
i
have
met
them
fleeing
from
the
town
my
life
would
pay
the
forfeit
alive
i
may
be
of
some
use
to
you
and
you
are
welcome
to
my
life
in
that
way
i
am
giving
it
freely
dead
i
should
be
a
mere
lump
of
carrion
who
remembers
even
the
names
of
those
who

been
done

twenty

heroic

i
think
it
is
wise
in

riot
we
are
placed
as
we
should
be
in
a
war
we
have
no
territory
no
base
of
supplies
no
organization
no
outside
sympathy
we
stand
in
the
position
of
a
race
in
a
case
like
this
without
money
and
without
friends
our
time
will
come
the
time
when
we
can
command
respect
for
our
rights
but
it
is
not
yet
in

give
it
up

into
the
lion
jaws
the
party
under
josh
leadership
moved
off
down
the
road
miller
while
entirely
convinced
that
he
had
acted
wisely
in
declining
to
accompany
them
was
yet
conscious
of
a
distinct
feeling
of
shame
and
envy
that
he
too
did
not
feel
impelled
to
throw
away
his
life
in
a
hopeless
struggle
watson
left
the
buggy
and
disappeared
by
a
path
at
the
roadside
miller
drove
rapidly
forward
after
entering
the
town
he
passed
several
small
parties
of
white
men
but
escaped
scrutiny
by
sitting
well
back
in
his
buggy
the
presumption
being
that
a
man
with
a
good
horse
and
buggy
was
white
torn
with
anxiety
he
reached
home
at
about
four
driving
the
horse
into
the
yard
he
sprang
down
from
the
buggy
and
hastened
to
the
house
which
he
found
locked
front
and
rear
a
repeated
rapping
brought
no
response
at
length
he
broke
a
window
and
entered
the
house
like
a
thief
janet
janet
he
called
in
alarm
where
are
you
it
is
only
i
will
there
was
no
reply
he
ran
from
room
to
room
only
to
find
them
all
empty
again
he
called
his
wife
name
and
was
about
rushing
from
the
house
when
a
muffled
voice
came
faintly
to
his
ear
is
dat
you
doctuh
miller
yes
who
are
you
and
where
are
my
wife
and
child
he
was
looking
around
in
perplexity
when
the
door
of
a
low
closet
under
the
kitchen
sink
was
opened
from
within
and
a
woolly
head
was
cautiously
protruded
are
you
dat
you

they
not

women
of
that
i
sure
enough
although
i
have
yet
got
the
bearings
of
this
deplorable
affair
stay
here
and
look
after
the
house
i
must
find
my
wife
and
child
the
distance
across
the
city
to
the
home
of
the
butler
whom
his
wife
had
gone
to
visit
was
exactly
one
mile
though
miller
had
a
good
horse
in
front
of
him
he
was
two
hours
in
reaching
his
destination
never
will
the
picture
of
that
ride
fade
from
his
memory
in
his
dreams
he
repeats
it
night
after
night
and
sees
the
sights
that
wounded
his
eyes
and
feels
the
thoughts
the
haunting
spirits
of
the
thoughts
that
tore
his
heart
as
he
rode
through
hell
to
find
those
whom
he
was
seeking
for
a
short
distance
he
saw
nothing
and
made
rapid
progress
as
he
turned
the
first
corner
his
horse
shied
at
the
dead
body
of
a
negro
lying
huddled
up
in
the
collapse
which
marks
sudden
death
what
miller
shuddered
at
was
not
so
much
the
thought
of
death
to
the
sight
of
which
his
profession
had
accustomed
him
as
the
suggestion
of
what
it
signified
he
had
taken
with
allowance
the
wild
statement
of
the
fleeing
fugitives
watson
too
had
been
greatly
excited
and
josh
green
group
were
desperate
men
as
much
liable
to
be
misled
by
their
courage
as
the
others
by
their
fears
but
here
was
proof
that
murder
had
been
done
and
his
wife
and
children
were
in
the
town
distant
shouts
and
the
sound
of
firearms
increased
his
alarm
he
struck
his
horse
with
the
whip
and
dashed
on
toward
the
heart
of
the
city
which
he
must
traverse
in
order
to
reach
janet
and
the
child
at
the
next
corner
lay
the
body
of
another
man
with
the
red
blood
oozing
from
a
ghastly
wound
in
the
forehead
the
negroes
seemed
to
have
been
killed
as
the
band
plays
in
circus
parades
at
the
street
intersections
where
the
example
would
be
most
effective
miller
with
a
wild
leap
of
the
heart
had
barely
passed
this
gruesome
spectacle
when
a
sharp
voice
commanded
him
to
halt
and
emphasized
the
order
by
covering
him
with
a
revolver
forgetting
the
prudence
he
had
preached
to
others
he
had
raised
his
whip
to
strike
the
horse
when
several
hands
seized
the
bridle
come
down
you
damn
fool
growled
an
authoritative
voice
do
you
see
we
in
earnest
do
you
want
to
get
killed
why
should
i
come
down
asked
miller
because
we
ordered
you
to
come
down
this
is
the
white
people
day
and
when
they
order
a
nigger
must
obey
we
going
to
search
you
for
weapons
search
away
you
find
nothing
but
a
case
of
surgeon
tools
which
i
more
than
likely
to
need
before
this
day
is
over
from
all
indications
no
matter
we
make
sure
of
it
that
what
we
here
for
come
down
if
you
do
want
to
be
pulled
down
miller
stepped
down
from
his
buggy
his
interlocutor
who
made
no
effort
at
disguise
was
a
clerk
in
a
store
where
miller
bought
most
of
his
family
and
hospital
supplies
he
made
no
sign
of
recognition
however
and
miller
claimed
no
acquaintance
this
man
who
had
for
several
years
emptied
miller
pockets
in
the
course
of
more
or
less
legitimate
trade
now
went
through
them
aided
by
another
man
more
rapidly
than
ever
before
the
searchers
convincing
themselves
that
miller
carried
no
deadly
weapon
upon
his
person
meanwhile
a
third
ransacked
the
buggy
with
like
result
miller
recognized
several
others
of
the
party
who
made
not
the
slightest
attempt
at
disguise
though
no
names
were
called
by
any
one
where
are
you
going
demanded
the
leader
i
am
looking
for
my
wife
and
child
replied
miller
well
run
along
and
keep
them
out
of
the
streets
when
you
find
them
and
keep
your
hands
out
of
this
affair
if
you
wish
to
live
in
this
town
which
from
now
on
will
be
a
white
man
town
as
you
niggers
will
be
pretty
firmly
convinced
before
night
miller
drove
on
as
swiftly
as
might
be
at
the
next
corner
he
was
stopped
again
in
the
white
man
who
held
him
up
miller
recognized
a
neighbor
of
his
own
after
a
short
detention
and
a
perfunctory
search
the
white
man
remarked
apologetically
sorry
to
have
had
to
trouble
you
doctuh
but
them
the
it
ai
men
like
you
that
we
after
but
the
vicious
and
criminal
class
of
niggers
miller
smiled
bitterly
as
he
urged
his
horse
forward
he
was
quite
well
aware
that
the
virtuous
citizen
who
had
stopped
him
had
only
a
few
weeks
before
finished
a
term
in
the
penitentiary
to
which
he
had
been
sentenced
for
stealing
miller
knew
that
he
could
have
bought
all
the
man
owned
for
fifty
dollars
and
his
soul
for
as
much
more
a
few
rods
farther
on
he
came
near
running
over
the
body
of
a
wounded
man
who
lay
groaning
by
the
wayside
every
professional
instinct
urged
him
to
stop
and
offer
aid
to
the
sufferer
but
the
uncertainty
concerning
his
wife
and
child
proved
a
stronger
motive
and
urged
him
resistlessly
forward
here
and
there
the
ominous
sound
of
firearms
was
audible
he
might
have
thought
this
merely
a
part
of
the
show
like
the
powder
play
of
the
arabs
but
for
the
bloody
confirmation
of
its
earnestness
which
had
already
assailed
his
vision
somewhere
in
this
seething
caldron
of
unrestrained
passions
were
his
wife
and
child
and
he
must
hurry
on
his
progress
was
painfully
slow
three
times
he
was
stopped
and
searched
more
than
once
his
way
was
barred
and
he
was
ordered
to
turn
back
each
such
occasion
requiring
a
detour
which
consumed
many
minutes
the
man
who
last
stopped
him
was
a
jewish
merchant
a
jew
god
of
moses
had
so
far
forgotten
twenty
centuries
of
history
as
to
join
in
the
persecution
of
another
oppressed
race
when
almost
reduced
to
despair
by
these
innumerable
delays
he
perceived
coming
toward
him
ellis
the
of
the
morning
chronicle
miller
had
just
been
stopped
and
questioned
again
and
ellis
came
up
as
he
was
starting
once
more
upon
his
endless
ride
miller
said
ellis
kindly
it
is
dangerous
for
you
on
the
streets
why
tempt
the
danger
i
am
looking
for
my
wife
and
child
returned
miller
in
desperation
they
are
somewhere
in
this
town
i
do
know
where
and
i
must
find
them
ellis
had
been
by
the
tragedy
of
the
afternoon
the
wholly
superfluous
slaughter
of
a
harmless
people
whom
a
show
of
force
would
have
been
quite
sufficient
to
overawe
elaborate
explanations
were
afterwards
given
for
these
murders
which
were
said
perhaps
truthfully
not
to
have
been
premeditated
and
many
regrets
were
expressed
the
young
man
had
been
surprised
quite
as
much
as
the
negroes
themselves
at
the
ferocity
displayed
his
own
thoughts
and
feelings
were
attuned
to
anything
but
slaughter
only
that
morning
he
had
received
a
perfumed
note
calling
his
attention
to
what
the
writer
described
as
a
very
noble
deed
of
his
and
requesting
him
to
call
that
evening
and
receive
the
writer
thanks
had
he
known
that
miss
pemberton
several
weeks
after
their
visit
to
the
sound
had
driven
out
again
to
the
hotel
and
made
some
inquiries
among
the
servants
he
might
have
understood
better
the
meaning
of
this
missive
when
miller
spoke
of
his
wife
and
child
some
subtle
thread
of
suggestion
coupled
the
note
with
miller
plight
i
go
with
you
miller
he
said
if
you
permit
me
in
my
company
you
will
not
be
disturbed
he
took
a
seat
in
miller
buggy
after
which
it
was
not
molested
neither
of
them
spoke
miller
was
sick
at
heart
he
could
have
wept
with
grief
even
had
the
welfare
of
his
own
dear
ones
not
been
involved
in
this
regrettable
affair
with
prophetic
instinct
he
foresaw
the
hatreds
to
which
this
day
would
give
birth
the
long
years
of
constraint
and
distrust
which
would
still
further
widen
the
breach
between
two
peoples
whom
fate
had
thrown
together
in
one
community
there
was
nothing
for
ellis
to
say
in
his
heart
he
could
not
defend
the
deeds
of
this
day
the
petty
annoyances
which
the
whites
had
felt
at
the
spectacle
of
a
few
negroes
in
office
the
not
unnatural
resentment
of
a
proud
people
at
what
had
seemed
to
them
a
presumptuous
freedom
of
speech
and
lack
of
deference
on
the
part
of
their
inferiors
these
things
which
he
knew
were
to
be
made
the
excuse
for
overturning
the
city
government
he
realized
full
well
were
no
sort
of
justification
for
the
wholesale
murder
or
other
horrors
which
might
well
ensue
before
the
day
was
done
he
could
not
approve
the
acts
of
his
own
people
neither
could
he
to
a
negro
condemn
them
hence
he
was
silent
thank
you
ellis
exclaimed
miller
when
they
had
reached
the
house
where
he
expected
to
find
his
wife
this
is
the
place
where
i
was
going
i
am
under
a
great
obligation
to
you
not
at
all
miller
i
need
not
tell
you
how
much
i
regret
this
deplorable
affair
ellis
went
back
down
the
street
fastening
his
horse
to
the
fence
miller
sprang
forward
to
find
his
wife
and
child
they
would
certainly
be
there
for
no
colored
woman
would
be
foolhardy
enough
to
venture
on
the
streets
after
the
riot
had
broken
out
as
he
drew
nearer
he
felt
a
sudden
apprehension
the
house
seemed
strangely
silent
and
deserted
the
doors
were
closed
and
the
venetian
blinds
shut
tightly
even
a
dog
which
had
appeared
slunk
timidly
back
under
the
house
instead
of
barking
vociferously
according
to
the
usual
habit
of
his
kind
xxxiv
the
valley
of
the
shadow
miller
knocked
at
the
door
there
was
no
response
he
went
round
to
the
rear
of
the
house
the
dog
had
slunk
behind
the
woodpile
miller
knocked
again
at
the
back
door
and
receiving
no
reply
called
aloud
butler
it
is
i
miller
is
my
wife
here
the
slats
of
a
blind
opened
cautiously
is
it
really
you
dr
miller
yes
butler
i
am
looking
for
my
wife
and
child
are
they
here
no
sir
she
became
alarmed
about
you
soon
after
the
shooting
commenced
and
i
could
not
keep
her
she
left
for
home
half
an
hour
ago
it
is
coming
on
dusk
and
she
and
the
child
are
so
near
white
that
she
did
not
expect
to
be
molested
which
way
did
she
go
she
meant
to
go
by
the
main
street
she
thought
it
would
be
less
dangerous
than
the
back
streets
i
tried
to
get
her
to
stay
here
but
she
was
frantic
about
you
and
nothing
i
could
say
would
keep
her
is
the
riot
almost
over
miller
do
you
think
they
will
murder
us
all
and
burn
down
our
houses
god
knows
replied
miller
with
a
groan
but
i
must
find
her
if
i
lose
my
own
life
in
the
attempt
surely
he
thought
janet
would
be
safe
the
white
people
of
wellington
were
not
savages
or
at
least
their
temporary
reversion
to
savagery
would
not
go
as
far
as
to
include
violence
to
delicate
women
and
children
then
there
flashed
into
his
mind
josh
green
story
of
his
silly
mother
who
for
twenty
years
had
walked
the
earth
as
a
child
as
the
result
of
one
night
terror
and
his
heart
sank
within
him
miller
realized
that
his
buggy
by
attracting
attention
had
been
a
hindrance
rather
than
a
help
in
his
progress
across
the
city
in
order
to
follow
his
wife
he
must
practically
retrace
his
steps
over
the
very
route
he
had
come
night
was
falling
it
would
be
easier
to
cross
the
town
on
foot
in
the
dusk
his
own
color
slight
in
the
daytime
would
not
attract
attention
and
by
dodging
in
the
shadows
he
might
avoid
those
who
might
wish
to
intercept
him
but
he
must
reach
janet
and
the
boy
at
any
risk
he
had
not
been
willing
to
throw
his
life
away
hopelessly
but
he
would
cheerfully
have
sacrificed
it
for
those
whom
he
loved
he
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
and
had
not
yet
reached
the
centre
of
mob
activity
when
he
intercepted
a
band
of
negro
laborers
from
the
cotton
compress
with
big
josh
green
at
their
head
hello

cried
josh

they

not

for
they
benefit
the

and
they

the
colored
people
who

every

they
went
their
way
and
miller
hurried
on
they
might
resist
attack
he
thought
it
extremely
unlikely
that
they
would
begin
it
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
mere
knowledge
that
some
of
the
negroes
contemplated
resistance
would
only
further
inflame
the
infuriated
whites
the
colored
men
might
win
a
momentary
victory
though
it
was
extremely
doubtful
and
they
would
as
surely
reap
the
harvest
later
on
the
qualities
which
in
a
white
man
would
win
the
applause
of
the
world
would
in
a
negro
be
taken
as
the
marks
of
savagery
so
thoroughly
diseased
was
public
opinion
in
matters
of
race
that
the
negro
who
died
for
the
common
rights
of
humanity
might
look
for
no
meed
of
admiration
or
glory
at
such
a
time
in
the
white
man
eyes
a
negro
courage
would
be
mere
desperation
his
love
of
liberty
a
mere
animal
dislike
of
restraint
every
finer
human
instinct
would
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
savagery
or
if
forced
to
admire
they
would
none
the
less
repress
they
would
applaud
his
courage
while
they
stretched
his
neck
or
carried
off
the
fragments
of
his
mangled
body
as
souvenirs
in
much
the
same
way
that
savages
preserve
the
scalps
or
eat
the
hearts
of
their
enemies
but
concern
for
the
fate
of
josh
and
his
friends
occupied
only
a
secondary
place
in
miller
mind
for
the
moment
his
wife
and
child
were
somewhere
ahead
of
him
he
pushed
on
he
had
covered
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
more
and
far
down
the
street
could
see
the
signs
of
greater
animation
when
he
came
upon
the
body
of
a
woman
lying
upon
the
sidewalk
in
the
dusk
he
had
almost
stumbled
over
it
and
his
heart
came
up
in
his
mouth
a
second
glance
revealed
that
it
could
not
be
his
wife
it
was
a
fearful
portent
however
of
what
her
fate
might
be
the
war
had
reached
the
women
and
children
yielding
to
a
professional
instinct
he
stooped
and
saw
that
the
prostrate
form
was
that
of
old
aunt
jane
letlow
she
was
not
yet
quite
dead
and
as
miller
with
a
tender
touch
placed
her
head
in
a
more
comfortable
position
her
lips
moved
with
a
last
lingering
flicker
of
consciousness
comin
missis
comin
mammy
jane
had
gone
to
join
the
old
mistress
upon
whose
memory
her
heart
was
fixed
and
yet
not
all
her
reverence
for
her
old
mistress
nor
all
her
deference
to
the
whites
nor
all
their
friendship
for
her
had
been
able
to
save
her
from
this
raging
devil
of
race
hatred
which
momentarily
possessed
the
town
perceiving
that
he
could
do
no
good
miller
hastened
onward
sick
at
heart
whenever
he
saw
a
party
of
white
men
approaching
these
brave
reformers
never
went
singly
he
sought
concealment
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
or
the
shrubbery
in
some
yard
until
they
had
passed
he
had
covered
about
two
thirds
of
the
distance
homeward
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
group
beneath
a
at
sight
of
which
he
turned
pale
with
horror
and
rushed
forward
with
a
terrible
cry
xxxv
mine
enemy
o
mine
enemy
the
proceedings
of
the
day
planned
originally
as
a
demonstration
dignified
subsequently
as
a
revolution
under
any
name
the
culmination
of
the
conspiracy
formed
by
carteret
and
his
colleagues
had
by
seven
in
the
afternoon
developed
into
a
murderous
riot
crowds
of
white
men
and
boys
drunk
with
whiskey
or
with
license
raged
through
the
streets
beating
chasing
or
killing
any
negro
so
unfortunate
as
to
fall
into
their
hands
why
any
particular
negro
was
assailed
no
one
stopped
to
inquire
it
was
merely
a
white
mob
thirsting
for
black
blood
with
no
more
conscience
or
discrimination
than
would
be
exercised
by
a
wolf
in
a
sheepfold
it
was
race
against
race
the
whites
against
the
negroes
and
it
was
a
affair
for
until
josh
green
got
together
his
body
of
armed
men
no
effective
resistance
had
been
made
by
any
colored
person
and
the
individuals
who
had
been
killed
had
so
far
left
no
marks
upon
the
enemy
by
which
they
might
be
remembered
kill
the
niggers
rang
out
now
and
then
through
the
dusk
and
far
down
the
street
and
along
the
intersecting
thoroughfares
distant
voices
took
up
the
ominous
refrain
kill
the
niggers
kill
the
damned
niggers
now
not
a
dark
face
had
been
seen
on
the
street
for
half
an
hour
until
the
group
of
men
headed
by
josh
made
their
appearance
in
the
negro
quarter
armed
with
guns
and
axes
they
presented
quite
a
formidable
appearance
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
new
hospital
near
which
stood
a
schoolhouse
and
a
large
church
both
used
by
the
colored
people
they
did
not
reach
their
destination
without
having
met
a
number
of
white
men
singly
or
in
twos
or
threes
and
the
rumor
spread
with
incredible
swiftness
that
the
negroes
in
turn
were
up
in
arms
determined
to
massacre
all
the
whites
and
burn
the
town
some
of
the
whites
became
alarmed
and
recognizing
the
power
of
the
negroes
if
armed
and
conscious
of
their
strength
were
impressed
by
the
immediate
necessity
of
overpowering
and
overawing
them
others
with
appetites
already
whetted
by
slaughter
saw
a
chance
welcome
rather
than
not
of
shedding
more
black
blood
spontaneously
the
white
mob
flocked
toward
the
hospital
where
rumor
had
it
that
a
large
body
of
desperate
negroes
breathing
threats
of
blood
and
fire
had
taken
a
determined
stand
it
had
been
josh
plan
merely
to
remain
quietly
and
peaceably
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
little
group
of
public
institutions
molesting
no
one
unless
first
attacked
and
merely
letting
the
white
people
see
that
they
meant
to
protect
their
own
but
so
rapidly
did
the
rumor
spread
and
so
promptly
did
the
white
people
act
that
by
the
time
josh
and
his
supporters
had
reached
the
top
of
the
rising
ground
where
the
hospital
stood
a
crowd
of
white
men
much
more
numerous
than
their
own
party
were
following
them
at
a
short
distance
josh
with
the
eye
of
a
general
perceived
that
some
of
his
party
were
becoming
a
little
nervous
and
decided
that
they
would
feel
safer

jerry
letlow
who
had
kept
out
of
sight
during
the
day
had
started
out
after
night
had
set
in
to
find
major
carteret
jerry
was
very
much
afraid
the
events
of
the
day
had
filled
him
with
terror
whatever
the
limitations
of
jerry
mind
or
character
may
have
been
jerry
had
a
keen
appreciation
of
the
danger
to
the
negroes
when
they
came
in
conflict
with
the
whites
and
he
had
no
desire
to
imperil
his
own
skin
he
valued
his
life
for
his
own
sake
and
not
for
any
altruistic
theory
that
it
might
be
of
service
to
others
in
other
words
jerry
was
something
of
a
coward
he
had
kept
in
hiding
all
day
but
finding
toward
evening
that
the
riot
did
not
abate
and
fearing
from
the
rumors
which
came
to
his
ears
that
all
the
negroes
would
be
exterminated
he
had
set
out
somewhat
desperately
to
try
to
find
his
white
patron
and
protector
he
had
been
cautious
to
avoid
meeting
any
white
men
and
anticipating
no
danger
from
those
of
his
own
race
went
toward
the
party
which
he
saw
approaching
whose
path
would
cross
his
own
when
they
were
only
a
few
yards
apart
josh
took
a
step
forward
and
caught
jerry
by
the
arm
come
along
jerry
we
need
you
here
another
man
boys
come
on
now
and
fight
fer
yo

folks

ter
pester
me
dey
my
frien
me
loose
me
loose
er
we
all

ter

killed
the
party
paid
no
attention
to
jerry
protestations
indeed
with
the
crowd
of
whites
following
behind
they
were
simply
considering
the
question
of
a
position
from
which
they
could
most
effectively
defend
themselves
and
the
building
which
they
imagined
to
be
threatened
if
josh
had
released
his
grip
of
jerry
that
worthy
could
easily
have
escaped
from
the
crowd
but
josh
maintained
his
hold
almost
mechanically
and
in
the
confusion
jerry
found
himself
swept
with
the
rest
into
the
hospital
the
doors
of
which
were
promptly
barricaded
with
the
heavier
pieces
of
furniture
and
the
windows
manned
by
several
men
each
josh
with
the
instinct
of
a
born
commander
posting
his
forces
so
that
they
could
cover
with
their
guns
all
the
approaches
to
the
building
jerry
still
continuing
to
make
himself
troublesome
josh
in
a
moment
of
impatience
gave
him
a
terrific
box
on
the
ear
which
stretched
him
out
upon
the
floor
unconscious
shet
up
he
said
ef
you
ca
stan
up
like
a
man
keep
still
and
do
interfere
wid
men
will
fight
the
hospital
when
josh
and
his
men
took
possession
had
been
found
deserted
fortunately
there
were
no
patients
for
that
day
except
one
or
two
convalescents
and
these
with
the
attendants
had
joined
the
exodus
of
the
colored
people
from
the
town
a
white
man
advanced
from
the
crowd
without
toward
the
main
entrance
to
the
hospital
big
josh
looking
out
from
a
window
grasped
his
gun
more
firmly
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
man
who
had
murdered
his
father
and
darkened
his
mother
life
mechanically
he
raised
his
rifle
but
lowered
it
as
the
white
man
lifted
up
his
hand
as
a
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
you
niggers
called

loudly
it
was
that

responded
mcbane
you

warning
your

your
his
speech
was
interrupted
by
a
shot
from
the
crowd
which
splintered
the
close
to
josh
head
this
was
followed
by
half
a
dozen
other
shots
which
were
replied
to
almost
simultaneously
by
a
volley
from
within
by
which
one
of
the
attacking
party
was
killed
and
another
wounded
this
roused
the
mob
to
frenzy
vengeance
vengeance
they
yelled
kill
the
niggers
a
negro
had
killed
a
white
man
the
unpardonable
sin
admitting
neither
excuse
justification
nor
extenuation
from
time
immemorial
it
had
been
bred
in
the
southern
white
consciousness
and
in
the
negro
consciousness
also
for
that
matter
that
the
person
of
a
white
man
was
sacred
from
the
touch
of
a
negro
no
matter
what
the
provocation
a
dozen
colored
men
lay
dead
in
the
streets
of
wellington
inoffensive
people
slain
in
cold
blood
because
they
had
been
bold
enough
to
question
the
authority
of
those
who
had
assailed
them
or
frightened
enough
to
flee
when
they
had
been
ordered
to
stand
still
but
their
lives
counted
nothing
against
that
of
a
riotous
white
man
who
had
courted
death
by
attacking
a
body
of
armed
men
the
crowd
too
surrounding
the
hospital
had
changed
somewhat
in
character
the
men
who
had
acted
as
leaders
in
the
early
afternoon
having
accomplished
their
purpose
of
overturning
the
local
administration
and
establishing
a
provisional
government
of
their
own
had
withdrawn
from
active
participation
in
the
rioting
deeming
the
negroes
already
sufficiently
overawed
to
render
unlikely
any
further
trouble
from
that
source
several
of
the
ringleaders
had
indeed
begun
to
exert
themselves
to
prevent
further
disorder
or
any
loss
of
property
the
possibility
of
which
had
become
apparent
but
those
who
set
in
motion
the
forces
of
evil
can
not
always
control
them
afterwards
the
baser
element
of
the
white
population
recruited
from
the
wharves
and
the
saloons
was
now
predominant
captain
mcbane
was
the
only
one
of
the
revolutionary
committee
who
had
remained
with
the
mob
not
with
any
purpose
to
restore
or
preserve
order
but
because
he
found
the
company
and
the
occasion
entirely
congenial
he
had
had
no
opportunity
at
least
no
tenable
excuse
to
kill
or
maim
a
negro
since
the
termination
of
his
contract
with
the
state
for
convicts
and
this
occasion
had
awakened
a
dormant
appetite
for
these
diversions
we
are
all
puppets
in
the
hands
of
fate
and
seldom
see
the
strings
that
move
us
mcbane
had
lived
a
life
of
violence
and
cruelty
as
a
man
sows
so
shall
he
reap
in
works
of
fiction
such
men
are
sometimes
converted
more
often
in
real
life
they
do
not
change
their
natures
until
they
are
converted
into
dust
one
does
well
to
distrust
a
tamed
tiger
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
a
few
of
the
better
class
or
at
least
of
the
better
clad
were
looking
on
the
double
volley
described
had
already
been
fired
when
the
number
of
these
was
augmented
by
the
arrival
of
major
carteret
and
ellis
who
had
just
come
from
the
chronicle
office
where
the
next
day
paper
had
been
in
hasty
preparation
they
pushed
their
way
towards
the
front
of
the
crowd
this
must
be
stopped
ellis
said
carteret
they
are
burning
houses
and
killing
women
and
children
old
jane
good
old
mammy
jane
who
nursed
my
wife
at
her
bosom
and
has
waited
on
her
and
my
child
within
a
few
weeks
was
killed
only
a
few
rods
from
my
house
to
which
she
was
evidently
fleeing
for
protection
it
must
have
been
by
accident
i
can
not
believe
that
any
white
man
in
town
would
be
dastard
enough
to
commit
such
a
deed
intentionally
i
would
have
defended
her
with
my
own
life
we
must
try
to
stop
this
thing
easier
said
than
done
returned
ellis
it
is
in
the
fever
stage
and
must
burn
itself
out
we
shall
be
lucky
if
it
does
not
burn
the
town
out
suppose
the
negroes
should
also
take
a
hand
at
the
burning
we
have
advised
the
people
to
put
the
negroes
down
and
they
are
doing
the
job
thoroughly
my
god
replied
the
other
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
as
he
continued
to
elbow
his
way
through
the
crowd
i
meant
to
keep
them
in
their
places
i
did
not
intend
wholesale
murder
and
arson
carteret
having
reached
the
front
of
the
mob
made
an
effort
to
gain
their
attention
gentlemen
he
cried
in
his
loudest
tones
his
voice
unfortunately
was
neither
loud
nor
piercing
kill
the
niggers
clamored
the
mob
gentlemen
i
implore
you
the
crash
of
a
dozen
windows
broken
by
stones
and
pistol
shots
drowned
his
voice
gentlemen
he
shouted
this
is
murder
it
is
madness
it
is
a
disgrace
to
our
city
to
our
state
to
our
civilization
that
right
replied
several
voices
the
mob
had
recognized
the
speaker
it
a
disgrace
and
we
not
put
up
with
it
a
moment
longer
burn
out
hurrah
for
major
carteret
the
champion
of
supremacy
three
cheers
for
the
morning
chronicle
and
nigger
domination
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
yelled
the
crowd
in
vain
the
baffled
orator
gesticulated
and
shrieked
in
the
effort
to
correct
the
misapprehension
their
oracle
had
spoken
not
hearing
what
he
said
they
assumed
it
to
mean
encouragement
and
coöperation
their
present
course
was
but
the
logical
outcome
of
the
crusade
which
the
morning
chronicle
had
preached
in
season
and
out
of
season
for
many
months
when
carteret
had
spoken
and
the
crowd
had
cheered
him
they
felt
that
they
had
done
all
that
courtesy
required
and
he
was
elbowed
aside
while
they
proceeded
with
the
work
in
hand
which
was
now
to
drive
out
the
negroes
from
the
hospital
and
avenge
the
killing
of
their
comrade
some
brought
hay
some
kerosene
and
others
wood
from
a
pile
which
had
been
thrown
into
a
vacant
lot
near
by
several
safe
ways
of
approach
to
the
building
were
discovered
and
the
combustibles
placed
and
fired
the
flames
soon
gaining
a
foothold
leaped
upward
catching
here
and
there
at
the
exposed
woodwork
and
licking
the
walls
hungrily
with
long
tongues
of
flame
meanwhile
a
desultory
firing
was
kept
up
from
the
outside
which
was
replied
to
scatteringly
from
within
the
hospital
those
inside
were
either
not
good
marksmen
or
excitement
had
spoiled
their
aim
if
a
face
appeared
at
a
window
a
dozen
pistol
shots
from
the
crowd
sought
the
spot
immediately
higher
and
higher
leaped
the
flames
suddenly
from
one
of
the
windows
sprang
a
black
figure
waving
a
white
handkerchief
it
was
jerry
letlow
regaining
consciousness
after
the
effect
of
josh
blow
had
subsided
jerry
had
kept
quiet
and
watched
his
opportunity
from
a
safe
he
had
scanned
the
crowd
without
in
search
of
some
white
friend
when
he
saw
major
carteret
moving
disconsolately
away
after
his
futile
effort
to
stem
the
torrent
jerry
made
a
dash
for
the
window
he
sprang
forth
and
waving
his
handkerchief
as
a
flag
of
truce
ran
toward
major
carteret
shouting
frantically
majah
carteret
majah
it
me
suh
jerry
suh
i
didn
go
in
dere
suh
i
wuz
drag
in
dere
i
wouldn
do
nothin
de
folks
suh
no
i
wouldn
suh
jerry
cries
were
drowned
in
a
roar
of
rage
and
a
volley
of
shots
from
the
mob
carteret
who
had
turned
away
with
ellis
did
not
even
hear
his
servant
voice
jerry
poor
flag
of
truce
his
explanations
his
reliance
upon
his
white
friends
all
failed
him
in
the
moment
of
supreme
need
in
that
hour
as
in
any
hour
when
the
depths
of
race
hatred
are
stirred
a
negro
was
no
more
than
a
brute
beast
set
upon
by
other
brute
beasts
whose
only
instinct
was
to
kill
and
destroy
let
us
leave
this
inferno
ellis
said
carteret
sick
with
anger
and
disgust
he
had
just
become
aware
that
a
negro
was
being
killed
though
he
did
not
know
whom
we
can
do
nothing
the
negroes
have
themselves
to
blame
they
tempted
us
beyond
endurance
i
counseled
firmness
and
firm
measures
were
taken
and
our
purpose
was
accomplished
i
am
not
responsible
for
these
subsequent
horrors
i
wash
my
hands
of
them
let
us
go
the
flames
gained
headway
and
gradually
enveloped
the
burning
building
until
it
became
evident
to
those
within
as
well
as
those
without
that
the
position
of
the
defenders
was
no
longer
tenable
would
they
die
in
the
flames
or
would
they
be
driven
out
the
uncertainty
soon
came
to
an
end
the
besieged
had
been
willing
to
fight
so
long
as
there
seemed
a
hope
of
successfully
defending
themselves
and
their
property
for
their
purpose
was
purely
one
of
defense
when
they
saw
the
case
was
hopeless
inspired
by
josh
green
reckless
courage
they
were
still
willing
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
one
or
two
of
them
had
already
been
killed
and
as
many
more
disabled
the
fate
of
jerry
letlow
had
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
several
others
who
could
scarcely
hide
their
fear
after
the
building
had
been
fired
josh
exhortations
were
no
longer
able
to
keep
them
in
the
hospital
they
preferred
to
fight
and
be
killed
in
the
open
rather
than
to
be
smothered
like
rats
in
a
hole
boys
exclaimed
josh

we

we

some
men
a
chance
ter

sorry
dey
ever
started
dis
fuss
the
door
was
thrown
open
suddenly
and
through
it
rushed
a
dozen
or
more
black
figures
armed
with
knives
pistols
or
clubbed
muskets
taken
by
sudden
surprise
the
white
people
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
but
the
approaching
negroes
had
scarcely
covered
half
the
distance
to
which
the
heat
of
the
flames
had
driven
back
the
mob
before
they
were
greeted
with
a
volley
that
laid
them
all
low
but
two
one
of
these
dazed
by
the
fate
of
his
companions
turned
instinctively
to
flee
but
had
scarcely
faced
around
before
he
fell
pierced
in
the
back
by
a
dozen
bullets
josh
green
the
tallest
and
biggest
of
them
all
had
not
apparently
been
touched
some
of
the
crowd
paused
in
involuntary
admiration
of
this
black
giant
famed
on
the
wharves
for
his
strength
sweeping
down
upon
them
a
smile
upon
his
face
his
eyes
lit
up
with
a
rapt
expression
which
seemed
to
take
him
out
of
mortal
ken
this
impression
was
heightened
by
his
apparent
immunity
from
the
shower
of
lead
which
less
susceptible
persons
had
continued
to
pour
at
him
armed
with
a
huge
a
relic
of
the
civil
war
which
he
had
carried
on
his
person
for
many
years
for
a
definite
purpose
and
which
he
had
kept
sharpened
to
a
razor
edge
he
reached
the
line
of
the
crowd
all
but
the
bravest
shrank
back
like
a
wedge
he
dashed
through
the
mob
which
parted
instinctively
before
him
and
all
oblivious
of
the
rain
of
lead
which
fell
around
him
reached
the
point
where
captain
mcbane
the
bravest
man
in
the
party
stood
waiting
to
meet
him
a
flashed
in
his
face
but
he
went
on
and
raising
his
powerful
right
arm
buried
his
knife
to
the
hilt
in
the
heart
of
his
enemy
when
the
crowd
dashed
forward
to
wreak
vengeance
on
his
dead
body
they
found
him
with
a
smile
still
upon
his
face
one
of
the
two
died
as
the
fool
dieth
which
was
it
or
was
it
both
vengeance
is
mine
saith
the
lord
and
it
had
not
been
left
to
him
but
they
that
do
violence
must
expect
to
suffer
violence
mcbane
death
was
merciful
compared
with
the
nameless
horrors
he
had
heaped
upon
the
hundreds
of
helpless
mortals
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
during
his
career
as
a
contractor
of
convict
labor
sobered
by
this
culminating
tragedy
the
mob
shortly
afterwards
dispersed
the
flames
soon
completed
their
work
and
this
handsome
structure
the
fruit
of
old
adam
miller
industry
the
monument
of
his
son
philanthropy
a
promise
of
good
things
for
the
future
of
the
city
lay
smouldering
in
ruins
a
melancholy
witness
to
the
fact
that
our
boasted
civilization
is
but
a
thin
veneer
which
cracks
and
scales
off
at
the
first
impact
of
primal
passions
xxxvi

by
the
light
of
the
burning
building
which
illuminated
the
street
for
several
blocks
major
carteret
and
ellis
made
their
way
rapidly
until
they
turned
into
the
street
where
the
major
lived
reaching
the
house
carteret
tried
the
door
and
found
it
locked
a
vigorous
ring
at
the
bell
brought
no
immediate
response
carteret
had
begun
to
pound
impatiently
upon
the
door
when
it
was
cautiously
opened
by
miss
pemberton
who
was
pale
and
trembled
with
excitement
where

asked
the
major

minutes

exclaimed
clara
coming
toward
him
with
both
hands
extended
can
nothing
be
done
to
stop
this
terrible
affair
i
wish
i
could
do
something
he
murmured
fervently
taking
both
her
trembling
hands
in
his
own
broad
palms
where
they
rested
with
a
surrendering
trustfulness
which
he
has
never
since
had
occasion
to
doubt
it
has
gone
too
far
already
and
the
end
i
fear
is
not
yet
but
it
can
not
grow
much
worse
the
editor
hurried
upstairs
carteret
wearing
a
worried
and
haggard
look
met
him
at
the
threshold
of
the
nursery
dodie
is
ill
she
said
at
three
when
the
trouble
began
i
was
over
at
albright
i
had
left
virgie
with
the
baby
when
i
came
back
she
and
all
the
other
servants
had
gone
they
had
heard
that
the
white
people
were
going
to
kill
all
the
negroes
and
fled
to
seek
safety
i
found
dodie
lying
in
a
draught
before
an
open
window
gasping
for
breath
i
ran
back
to
albright
i
had
found
her
much
better
and
she
let
her
nurse
come
over
the
nurse
says
that
dodie
is
threatened
with
membranous
croup
have
you
sent
for
dr
price
there
was
no
one
to
send
the
servants
were
gone
and
the
nurse
was
afraid
to
venture
out
into
the
street
i
telephoned
for
price
and
found
that
he
was
out
of
town
that
he
had
gone
up
the
river
this
morning
to
attend
a
patient
and
would
not
be
back
until
price
thought
that
he
had
anticipated
some
kind
of
trouble
in
the
town
and
had
preferred
to
be
where
he
could
not
be
called
upon
to
assume
any
responsibility
i
suppose
you
tried
dr
ashe
i
could
not
get
him
nor
any
one
else
after
that
first
call
the
telephone
service
is
disorganized
on
account
of
the
riot
we
need
medicine
and
ice
the
drugstores
are
all
closed
on
account
of
the
riot
and
for
the
same
reason
we
could
get
any
ice
major
carteret
stood
beside
the
brass
bedstead
upon
which
his
child
was
lying
his
only
child
around
whose
curly
head
clustered
all
his
hopes
upon
whom
all
his
life
for
the
past
year
had
been
centred
he
stooped
over
the
bed
beside
which
the
nurse
had
stationed
herself
she
was
wiping
the
child
face
which
was
red
and
swollen
and
covered
with
moisture
the
nostrils
working
rapidly
and
the
little
patient
vainly
endeavoring
at
intervals
to
cough
up
the
obstruction
to
his
breathing
is
it
serious
he
inquired
anxiously
he
had
always
thought
of
the
croup
as
a
childish
ailment
that
yielded
readily
to
proper
treatment
but
the
child
evident
distress
impressed
him
with
sudden
fear
dangerous
replied
the
young
woman
laconically
you
came
none
too
soon
if
a
doctor
is
got
at
once
the
child
will
die
and
it
must
be
a
good
doctor
whom
can
i
call
he
asked
you
know
them
all
i
suppose
price
our
family
physician
is
out
of
town
ashe
has
charge
of
his
cases
when
he
is
away
replied
the
nurse
if
you
ca
find
him
try
hooper
the
child
is
growing
worse
every
minute
on
your
way
back
you
better
get
some
ice
if
possible
the
major
hastened
downstairs
do
wait
for
me
ellis
he
said
i
shall
be
needed
here
for
a
while
i
get
to
the
office
as
soon
as
possible
make
up
the
paper
and
leave
another
stick
out
for
me
to
the
last
minute
but
fill
it
up
in
case
i
not
on
hand
by
twelve
we
must
get
the
paper
out
early
in
the
morning
nothing
but
a
matter
of
the
most
vital
importance
would
have
kept
major
carteret
away
from
his
office
this
night
upon
the
presentation
to
the
outer
world
of
the
story
of
this
riot
would
depend
the
attitude
of
the
great
civilized
public
toward
the
events
of
the
last
ten
hours
the
chronicle
was
the
source
from
which
the
first
word
would
be
expected
it
would
give
the
people
of
wellington
their
cue
as
to
the
position
which
they
must
take
in
regard
to
this
distressful
affair
which
had
so
far
transcended
in
ferocity
the
most
extreme
measures
which
the
conspirators
had
anticipated
the
burden
of
his
own
responsibility
weighed
heavily
upon
him
and
could
not
be
shaken
off
but
he
must
do
first
the
duty
nearest
to
him
he
must
first
attend
to
his
child
carteret
hastened
from
the
house
and
traversed
rapidly
the
short
distance
to
ashe
office
far
down
the
street
he
could
see
the
glow
of
the
burning
hospital
and
he
had
scarcely
left
his
own
house
when
the
fusillade
of
shots
fired
when
the
colored
men
emerged
from
the
burning
building
was
audible
carteret
would
have
hastened
back
to
the
scene
of
the
riot
to
see
what
was
now
going
on
and
to
make
another
effort
to
stem
the
tide
of
bloodshed
but
before
the
dread
of
losing
his
child
all
other
interests
fell
into
the
background
not
all
the
negroes
in
wellington
could
weigh
in
the
balance
for
one
instant
against
the
life
of
the
feeble
child
now
gasping
for
breath
in
the
house
behind
him
reaching
the
house
a
vigorous
ring
brought
the
doctor
wife
to
the
door
good
evening
ashe
is
the
doctor
at
home
no
major
carteret
he
was
called
to
attend
wells
who
was
taken
suddenly
ill
as
a
result
of
the
trouble
this
afternoon
he
will
be
there
all
night
no
doubt
my
child
is
very
ill
and
i
must
find
some
one
try
yates
his
house
is
only
four
doors
away
a
ring
at
yates
door
brought
out
a
young
man
is
yates
in
yes
sir
can
i
see
him
you
might
see
him
sir
but
that
would
be
all
his
horse
was
frightened
by
the
shooting
on
the
streets
and
ran
away
and
threw
the
doctor
and
broke
his
right
arm
i
have
just
set
it
he
will
not
be
able
to
attend
any
patients
for
several
weeks
he
is
old
and
nervous
and
the
shock
was
great
are
you
not
a
physician
asked
carteret
looking
at
the
young
man
keenly
he
was
a
serious
gentlemanly
looking
young
fellow
whose
word
might
probably
be
trusted
yes
i
am
evans
yates
assistant
i
really
little
more
than
a
student
but
i
do
what
i
can
my
only
child
is
sick
with
the
croup
and
requires
immediate
attention
i
ought
to
be
able
to
handle
a
case
of
the
croup
answered
evans
at
least
in
the
first
stages
i
go
with
you
and
stay
by
the
child
and
if
the
case
is
beyond
me
i
may
keep
it
in
check
until
another
physician
comes
he
stepped
back
into
another
room
and
returning
immediately
with
his
hat
accompanied
carteret
homeward
the
riot
had
subsided
even
the
glow
from
the
smouldering
hospital
was
no
longer
visible
it
seemed
that
the
city
appalled
at
the
tragedy
had
suddenly
awakened
to
a
sense
of
its
own
crime
here
and
there
a
dark
face
emerging
cautiously
from
some
peered
from
behind
fence
or
tree
but
shrank
hastily
away
at
the
sight
of
a
white
face
the
negroes
of
wellington
with
the
exception
of
josh
green
and
his
party
had
not
behaved
bravely
on
this
critical
day
in
their
history
but
those
who
had
fought
were
dead
to
the
last
man
those
who
had
sought
safety
in
flight
or
concealment
were
alive
to
tell
the
tale
we
pass
right
by
thompson
said
evans
if
you
spoken
to
him
it
might
be
well
to
call
him
for
consultation
in
case
the
child
should
be
very
bad
go
on
ahead
said
carteret
and
i
get
him
evans
hastened
on
while
carteret
sounded
the
knocker
upon
the
doctor
door
a
negro
servant
clad
in
a
dress
suit
and
wearing
a
white
tie
came
to
the
door
de
doctuh
suh
he
replied
politely
to
carteret

suh

a

er

suh
carteret
hastened
homeward
he
could
think
of
no
other
available
physician
perhaps
no
other
would
be
needed
but
if
so
he
could
find
out
from
evans
whom
it
was
best
to
call
when
he
reached
the
child
room
the
young
doctor
was
bending
anxiously
over
the
little
frame
the
little
lips
had
become
livid
the
little
nails
lying
against
the
white
sheet
were
blue
the
child
efforts
to
breathe
were
most
distressing
and
each
gasp
cut
the
father
like
a
knife
carteret
was
weeping
hysterically
how
is
he
doctor
asked
the
major
he
is
very
low
replied
the
young
man
nothing
short
of
tracheotomy
an
operation
to
open
the
windpipe
will
relieve
him
without
it
in
half
or
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
will
be
unable
to
breathe
it
is
a
delicate
operation
a
mistake
in
which
would
be
as
fatal
as
the
disease
i
have
neither
the
knowledge
nor
the
experience
to
attempt
it
and
your
child
life
is
too
valuable
for
a
student
to
practice
upon
neither
have
i
the
instruments
here
what
shall
we
do
demanded
carteret
we
have
called
all
the
best
doctors
and
none
are
available
the
young
doctor
brow
was
wrinkled
with
thought
he
knew
a
doctor
who
could
perform
the
operation
he
had
heard
also
of
a
certain
event
at
carteret
house
some
months
before
when
an
unwelcome
physician
had
been
excluded
from
a
consultation
but
it
was
the
last
chance
there
is
but
one
other
doctor
in
town
who
has
performed
the
operation
so
far
as
i
know
he
declared
and
that
is
miller
if
you
can
get
him
he
can
save
your
child
life
carteret
hesitated
involuntarily
all
the
incidents
all
the
arguments
of
the
occasion
when
he
had
refused
to
admit
the
colored
doctor
to
his
house
came
up
vividly
before
his
memory
he
had
acted
in
accordance
with
his
lifelong
beliefs
and
had
carried
his
point
but
the
present
situation
was
different
this
was
a
case
of
imperative
necessity
and
every
other
interest
or
consideration
must
give
way
before
the
imminence
of
his
child
peril
that
the
doctor
would
refuse
the
call
he
did
not
imagine
it
would
be
too
great
an
honor
for
a
negro
to
decline
unless
some
bitterness
might
have
grown
out
of
the
proceedings
of
the
afternoon
that
this
doctor
was
a
man
of
some
education
he
knew
and
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
a
man
of
fine
feeling
for
a
negro
and
might
easily
have
taken
to
heart
the
day
events
nevertheless
he
could
hardly
refuse
a
professional
call
professional
ethics
would
require
him
to
respond
carteret
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
miller
had
ever
learned
of
what
had
occurred
at
the
house
during
visit
to
wellington
the
major
himself
had
never
mentioned
the
controversy
and
no
doubt
the
other
gentlemen
had
been
equally
silent
i
go
for
him
myself
said
evans
noting
carteret
hesitation
and
suspecting
its
cause
i
can
do
nothing
here
alone
for
a
little
while
and
i
may
be
able
to
bring
the
doctor
back
with
me
he
likes
a
difficult
operation
it
seemed
an
age
ere
the
young
doctor
returned
though
it
was
really
only
a
few
minutes
the
nurse
did
what
she
could
to
relieve
the
sufferings
which
grew
visibly
more
and
more
acute
the
mother
upon
the
other
side
of
the
bed
held
one
of
the
baby
hands
in
her
own
and
controlled
her
feelings
as
best
she
might
carteret
paced
the
floor
anxiously
going
every
few
seconds
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
listen
for
evans
footsteps
on
the
piazza
without
at
last
the
welcome
sound
was
audible
and
a
few
strides
took
him
to
the
door
miller
is
at
home
sir
reported
evans
as
he
came
in
he
says
that
he
was
called
to
your
house
once
before
by
a
third
person
who
claimed
authority
to
act
and
that
he
was
refused
admittance
he
declares
that
he
will
not
consider
such
a
call
unless
it
come
from
you
personally
that
is
true
quite
true
replied
carteret
his
position
is
a
just
one
i
will
go
at
once
will
will
my
child
live
until
i
can
get
miller
here
he
can
live
for
half
an
hour
without
an
operation
beyond
that
i
could
give
you
little
hope
seizing
his
hat
carteret
dashed
out
of
the
yard
and
ran
rapidly
to
miller
house
ordinarily
a
walk
of
six
or
seven
minutes
carteret
covered
it
in
three
and
was
almost
out
of
breath
when
he
rang
the
bell
of
miller
front
door
the
ring
was
answered
by
the
doctor
in
person
miller
i
believe
asked
carteret
yes
sir
i
am
major
carteret
my
child
is
seriously
ill
and
you
are
the
only
available
doctor
who
can
perform
the
necessary
operation
ah
you
have
tried
all
the
others
and
then
you
come
to
me
yes
i
do
not
deny
it
admitted
the
major
biting
his
lip
he
had
not
counted
on
professional
jealousy
as
an
obstacle
to
be
met
but
i
come
to
you
as
a
physician
to
engage
your
professional
services
for
my
child
my
only
child
i
have
confidence
in
your
skill
or
i
should
not
have
come
to
you
i
request
nay
i
implore
you
to
lose
no
more
time
but
come
with
me
at
once
my
child
life
is
hanging
by
a
thread
and
you
can
save
it
ah
replied
the
other
as
a
father
whose
only
child
life
is
in
danger
you
implore
me
of
all
men
in
the
world
to
come
and
save
it
there
was
a
strained
intensity
in
the
doctor
low
voice
that
struck
carteret
in
spite
of
his
own
he
thought
he
heard
too
from
the
adjoining
room
the
sound
of
some
one
sobbing
softly
there
was
some
mystery
here
which
he
could
not
fathom
unaided
miller
turned
to
the
door
behind
him
and
threw
it
open
on
the
white
cover
of
a
low
cot
lay
a
childish
form
in
the
rigidity
of
death
and
by
it
knelt
with
her
back
to
the
door
a
woman
whose
shoulders
were
shaken
by
the
violence
of
her
sobs
absorbed
in
her
grief
she
did
not
turn
or
give
any
sign
that
she
had
recognized
the
intrusion
there
major
carteret
exclaimed
miller
with
the
tragic
eloquence
of
despair
there
lies
a
specimen
of
your
handiwork
there
lies
only
child
laid
low
by
a
stray
bullet
in
this
riot
which
you
and
your
paper
have
fomented
struck
down
as
much
by
your
hand
as
though
you
had
held
the
weapon
with
which
his
life
was
taken
my
god
exclaimed
carteret
struck
with
horror
is
the
child
dead
there
he
lies
continued
the
other
an
innocent
child
there
he
lies
dead
his
little
life
snuffed
out
like
a
candle
because
you
and
a
handful
of
your
friends
thought
you
must
override
the
laws
and
run
this
town
at
any
cost
and
there
kneels
his
mother
overcome
by
grief
we
are
alone
in
the
house
it
is
not
safe
to
leave
her
unattended
my
duty
calls
me
here
by
the
side
of
my
dead
child
and
my
suffering
wife
i
can
not
go
with
you
there
is
a
just
god
in
heaven
as
you
have
sown
so
may
you
reap
carteret
possessed
a
narrow
but
a
logical
mind
and
except
when
confused
or
blinded
by
his
prejudices
had
always
tried
to
be
a
just
man
in
the
agony
of
his
own
predicament
in
the
horror
of
the
situation
at
miller
house
for
a
moment
the
veil
of
race
prejudice
was
rent
in
twain
and
he
saw
things
as
they
were
in
their
correct
proportions
and
relations
saw
clearly
and
convincingly
that
he
had
no
standing
here
in
the
presence
of
death
in
the
home
of
this
stricken
family
miller
refusal
to
go
with
him
was
pure
elemental
justice
he
could
not
blame
the
doctor
for
his
stand
he
was
indeed
conscious
of
a
certain
involuntary
admiration
for
a
man
who
held
in
his
hands
the
power
of
life
and
death
and
could
use
it
with
strict
justice
to
avenge
his
own
wrongs
in
miller
place
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
miller
had
spoken
the
truth
as
he
had
sown
so
must
he
reap
he
could
not
expect
could
not
ask
this
father
to
leave
his
own
household
at
such
a
moment
pressing
his
lips
together
with
grim
courage
and
bowing
mechanically
as
though
to
fate
rather
than
the
physician
carteret
turned
and
left
the
house
at
a
rapid
pace
he
soon
reached
home
there
was
yet
a
chance
for
his
child
perhaps
some
one
of
the
other
doctors
had
come
perhaps
after
all
the
disease
had
taken
a
favorable
turn
evans
was
but
a
young
doctor
and
might
have
been
mistaken
surely
with
doctors
all
around
him
his
child
would
not
be
permitted
to
die
for
lack
of
medical
attention
he
found
the
mother
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
still
grouped
as
he
had
left
them
around
the
suffering
child
how
is
he
now
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
a
groan
no
better
replied
the
doctor
steadily
growing
worse
he
can
go
on
probably
for
twenty
minutes
longer
without
an
operation
where
is
the
doctor
demanded
carteret
looking
eagerly
toward
the
door
you
should
have
brought
him
right
upstairs
there
not
a
minute
to
spare
phil
phil
our
child
will
die
carteret
heart
swelled
almost
to
bursting
with
an
intense
pity
even
his
own
great
sorrow
became
of
secondary
importance
beside
the
grief
which
his
wife
must
soon
feel
at
the
inevitable
loss
of
her
only
child
and
it
was
his
fault
would
that
he
could
risk
his
own
life
to
spare
her
and
to
save
the
child
briefly
and
as
gently
as
might
be
he
stated
the
result
of
his
errand
the
doctor
had
refused
to
come
for
a
good
reason
he
could
not
ask
him
again
young
evans
felt
the
logic
of
the
situation
which
carteret
had
explained
sufficiently
to
the
nurse
it
was
even
clearer
if
she
or
any
other
woman
had
been
in
the
doctor
place
she
would
have
given
the
same
answer
carteret
did
not
stop
to
reason
in
such
a
crisis
a
mother
heart
usurps
the
place
of
intellect
for
her
at
that
moment
there
were
but
two
facts
in
all
the
world
her
child
lay
dying
there
was
within
the
town
and
within
reach
a
man
who
could
save
him
with
an
agonized
cry
she
rushed
wildly
from
the
room
carteret
sought
to
follow
her
but
she
flew
down
the
long
stairs
like
a
wild
thing
the
least
misstep
might
have
precipitated
her
to
the
bottom
but
ere
carteret
with
a
remonstrance
on
his
lips
had
scarcely
reached
the
uppermost
step
she
had
thrown
open
the
front
door
and
fled
precipitately
out
into
the
night
xxxvii
the
sisters
miller
doorbell
rang
loudly
insistently
as
though
demanding
a
response
absorbed
in
his
own
grief
into
which
he
had
relapsed
upon
carteret
departure
the
sound
was
an
unwelcome
intrusion
surely
the
man
could
not
be
coming
back
if
it
were
some
one
else
what
else
might
happen
to
the
doomed
town
concerned
him
not
his
child
was
dead
his
distracted
wife
could
not
be
left
alone
the
doorbell
rang
clamorously
appealingly
through
the
long
hall
and
the
closed
door
of
the
room
where
he
sat
he
could
hear
some
one
knocking
and
a
faint
voice
calling
open
for
god
sake
open
it
was
a
woman
voice
the
voice
of
a
woman
in
distress
slowly
miller
rose
and
went
to
the
door
which
he
opened
mechanically
a
lady
stood
there
so
near
the
image
of
his
own
wife
whom
he
had
just
left
that
for
a
moment
he
was
startled
a
little
older
perhaps
a
little
fairer
of
complexion
but
with
the
same
form
the
same
features
marked
by
the
same
wild
grief
she
wore
a
loose
wrapper
which
clothed
her
like
the
drapery
of
a
statue
her
long
dark
hair
the
counterpart
of
his
wife
had
fallen
down
and
hung
disheveled
about
her
shoulders
there
was
blood
upon
her
knuckles
where
she
had
beaten
with
them
upon
the
door
miller
she
panted
breathless
from
her
flight
and
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
appealingly
when
he
shrank
from
the
contact
she
still
held
it
there
miller
you
will
come
and
save
my
child
you
know
what
it
is
to
lose
a
child
i
am
so
sorry
about
your
little
boy
you
will
come
to
mine
your
sorrow
comes
too
late
madam
he
said
harshly
my
child
is
dead
i
charged
your
husband
with
his
murder
and
he
could
not
deny
it
why
should
i
save
your
husband
child
ah
dr
miller
she
cried
with
his
wife
voice
she
never
knew
how
much
in
that
dark
hour
she
owed
to
that
resemblance
it
is
child
and
i
have
never
injured
you
it
is
my
child
miller
my
only
child
i
brought
it
into
the
world
at
the
risk
of
my
own
life
i
have
nursed
it
i
have
watched
over
it
i
have
prayed
for
it
and
it
now
lies
dying
oh
miller
dear
miller
if
you
have
a
heart
come
and
save
my
child
madam
he
answered
more
gently
moved
in
spite
of
himself
my
heart
is
broken
my
people
lie
dead
upon
the
streets
at
the
hands
of
yours
the
work
of
my
life
is
in
ashes
and
yonder
stretched
out
in
death
lies
my
own
child
god
woman
you
ask
too
much
of
human
nature
love
duty
sorrow
call
me
here
i
can
not
go
she
rose
to
her
full
height
then
you
are
a
murderer
she
cried
wildly
his
blood
be
on
your
head
and
a
mother
curse
beside
the
next
moment
with
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
she
had
thrown
herself
at
his
feet
at
the
feet
of
a
negro
this
proud
white
woman
and
was
clasping
his
knees
wildly
o
god
she
prayed
in
tones
which
quivered
with
anguish
pardon
my
husband
sins
and
my
own
and
move
this
man
hard
heart
by
the
blood
of
thy
son
who
died
to
save
us
all
it
was
the
last
appeal
of
poor
humanity
when
the
pride
of
intellect
and
caste
is
broken
when
we
grovel
in
the
dust
of
humiliation
when
sickness
and
sorrow
come
and
the
shadow
of
death
falls
upon
us
and
there
is
no
hope
elsewhere
we
turn
to
god
who
sometimes
swallows
the
insult
and
answers
the
appeal
miller
raised
the
lady
to
her
feet
he
had
been
deeply
moved
but
he
had
been
more
deeply
injured
this
was
his
wife
sister
ah
yes
but
a
sister
who
had
scorned
and
slighted
and
ignored
the
existence
of
his
wife
for
all
her
life
only
miller
of
all
the
world
could
have
guessed
what
this
had
meant
to
janet
and
he
had
merely
divined
it
through
the
clairvoyant
sympathy
of
love
this
woman
could
have
no
claim
upon
him
because
of
this
unacknowledged
relationship
yet
after
all
she
was
his
wife
sister
his
child
kinswoman
she
was
a
fellow
creature
too
and
in
distress
rise
madam
he
said
with
a
sudden
inspiration
lifting
her
gently
i
will
listen
to
you
on
one
condition
my
child
lies
dead
in
the
adjoining
room
his
mother
by
his
side
go
in
there
and
make
your
request
of
her
i
will
abide
by
her
decision
the
two
women
stood
confronting
each
other
across
the
body
of
the
dead
child
mute
witness
of
this
first
meeting
between
two
children
of
the
same
father
standing
thus
face
to
face
each
under
the
stress
of
the
deepest
emotions
the
resemblance
between
them
was
even
more
striking
than
it
had
seemed
to
miller
when
he
had
admitted
carteret
to
the
house
but
death
the
great
leveler
striking
upon
the
one
hand
and
threatening
upon
the
other
had
wrought
a
marvelous
transformation
in
the
bearing
of
the
two
women
the
janet
towered
erect
with
menacing
aspect
like
an
avenging
goddess
the
other
whose
pride
had
been
her
life
stood
in
the
attitude
of
a
trembling
suppliant
have
come
here
cried
janet
pointing
with
a
tragic
gesture
to
the
dead
child
to
gloat
over
your
husband
work
all
my
life
you
have
hated
and
scorned
and
despised
me
your
presence
here
insults
me
and
my
dead
what
are
you
doing
here
miller
returned
carteret
tremulously
dazed
for
a
moment
by
this
outburst
and
clasping
her
hands
with
an
imploring
gesture
my
child
my
only
child
is
dying
and
your
husband
alone
can
save
his
life
ah
let
me
have
my
child
she
moaned
it
is
my
only
one
my
sweet
child
my
ewe
lamb
this
was
only
child
replied
the
other
mother
and
yours
is
no
better
to
die
than
mine
you
are
young
said
carteret
and
may
yet
have
many
children
this
is
my
only
hope
if
you
have
a
human
heart
tell
your
husband
to
come
with
me
he
leaves
it
to
you
he
will
do
as
you
command
ah
cried
janet
i
have
a
human
heart
and
therefore
i
will
not
let
him
go
child
is
dead
o
god
my
child
my
child
she
threw
herself
down
by
the
bedside
sobbing
hysterically
the
other
woman
knelt
beside
her
and
put
her
arm
about
her
neck
for
a
moment
janet
absorbed
in
her
grief
did
not
repulse
her
listen
pleaded
carteret
you
will
not
let
my
baby
die
you
are
my
sister
the
child
is
your
own
near
kin
my
child
was
nearer
returned
janet
rising
again
to
her
feet
and
shaking
off
the
other
woman
arm
he
was
my
son
and
i
have
seen
him
die
i
have
been
your
sister
for
years
and
you
have
only
now
for
the
first
time
called
me
so
listen
sister
returned
carteret
was
there
no
way
to
move
this
woman
her
child
lay
dying
if
he
were
not
dead
already
she
would
tell
everything
and
leave
the
rest
to
god
if
it
would
save
her
child
she
would
shrink
at
no
sacrifice
whether
the
truth
would
still
further
incense
janet
or
move
her
to
mercy
she
could
not
tell
she
would
leave
the
issue
to
god
listen
sister
she
said
i
have
a
confession
to
make
you
are
my
lawful
sister
my
father
was
married
to
your
mother
you
are
entitled
to
his
name
and
to
half
his
estate
janet
eyes
flashed
with
bitter
scorn
and
you
have
robbed
me
all
these
years
and
now
tell
me
that
as
a
reason
why
i
should
forgive
the
murder
of
my
child
no
no
cried
the
other
wildly
fearing
the
worst
i
have
known
of
it
only
a
few
weeks
since
my
aunt
polly
death
i
had
not
meant
to
rob
you
i
had
meant
to
make
restitution
sister
for
our
father
sake
who
did
you
no
wrong
give
me
my
child
life
janet
eyes
slowly
filled
with
tears
bitter
tears
burning
tears
for
a
moment
even
her
grief
at
her
child
loss
dropped
to
second
place
in
her
thoughts
this
then
was
the
recognition
for
which
all
her
life
she
had
longed
in
secret
it
had
come
after
many
days
and
in
larger
measure
than
she
had
dreamed
but
it
had
come
not
with
frank
kindliness
and
sisterly
love
but
in
a
storm
of
blood
and
tears
not
freely
given
from
an
open
heart
but
extorted
from
a
reluctant
conscience
by
the
agony
of
a
mother
fears
janet
had
obtained
her
heart
desire
and
now
that
it
was
at
her
lips
found
it
but
apples
of
sodom
filled
with
dust
and
ashes
listen
she
cried
dashing
her
tears
aside
i
have
but
one
word
for
you
one
last
word
and
then
i
hope
never
to
see
your
face
again
my
mother
died
of
want
and
i
was
brought
up
by
the
hand
of
charity
now
when
i
have
married
a
man
who
can
supply
my
needs
you
offer
me
back
the
money
which
you
and
your
friends
have
robbed
me
of
you
imagined
that
the
shame
of
being
a
negro
swallowed
up
every
other
ignominy
and
in
your
eyes
i
am
a
negro
though
i
am
your
sister
and
you
are
white
and
people
have
taken
me
for
you
on
the
streets
and
you
therefore
left
me
nameless
all
my
life
now
when
an
honest
man
has
given
me
a
name
of
which
i
can
be
proud
you
offer
me
the
one
of
which
you
robbed
me
and
of
which
i
can
make
no
use
for
years
i
poor
despicable
fool
would
have
kissed
your
feet
for
a
word
a
nod
a
smile
now
when
this
tardy
recognition
comes
for
which
i
have
waited
so
long
it
is
tainted
with
fraud
and
crime
and
blood
and
i
must
pay
for
it
with
my
child
life
and
i
must
forfeit
that
of
mine
it
seems
for
withholding
it
so
long
sobbed
the
other
as
tottering
she
turned
to
go
it
is
but
just
stay
do
not
go
yet
commanded
janet
imperiously
her
pride
still
keeping
back
her
tears
i
have
not
done
i
throw
you
back
your
father
name
your
father
wealth
your
sisterly
recognition
i
want
none
of
them
they
are
bought
too
dear
ah
god
they
are
bought
too
dear
but
that
you
may
know
that
a
woman
may
be
foully
wronged
and
yet
may
have
a
heart
to
feel
even
for
one
who
has
injured
her
you
may
have
your
child
life
if
my
husband
can
save
it
will
she
said
throwing
open
the
door
into
the
next
room
go
with
her
god
will
bless
you
for
a
noble
woman
exclaimed
carteret
you
do
not
mean
all
the
cruel
things
you
have
said
ah
no
i
will
see
you
again
and
make
you
take
them
back
i
can
not
thank
you
now
oh
doctor
let
us
go
i
pray
god
we
may
not
be
too
late
together
they
went
out
into
the
night
carteret
tottered
under
the
stress
of
her
emotions
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
miller
caught
and
sustained
her
with
his
arm
until
they
reached
the
house
where
he
turned
over
her
fainting
form
to
carteret
at
the
door
is
the
child
still
alive
asked
miller
yes
thank
god
answered
the
father
but
nearly
gone
come
on
up
miller
called
evans
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
there
time
enough
but
none
to
spare
