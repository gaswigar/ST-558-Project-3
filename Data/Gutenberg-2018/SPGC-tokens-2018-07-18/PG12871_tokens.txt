foreword
the
day
before
the
rising
was
easter
sunday
and
they
were
crying
joyfully
in
the
churches
christ
has
risen
on
the
following
day
they
were
saying
in
the
streets
ireland
has
risen
the
luck
of
the
moment
was
with
her
the
auguries
were
good
and
notwithstanding
all
that
has
succeeded
i
do
not
believe
she
must
take
to
the
earth
again
nor
be
ever
again
buried
the
pages
hereafter
were
written
day
by
day
during
the
insurrection
that
followed
holy
week
and
as
a
hasty
impression
of
a
most
singular
time
the
author
allows
them
to
stand
without
any
emendation
the
few
chapters
which
make
up
this
book
are
not
a
history
of
the
rising
i
knew
nothing
about
the
rising
i
do
not
know
anything
about
it
now
and
it
may
be
years
before
exact
information
on
the
subject
is
available
what
i
have
written
is
no
more
than
a
statement
of
what
passed
in
one
quarter
of
our
city
and
a
gathering
together
of
the
rumour
and
tension
which
for
nearly
two
weeks
had
to
serve
the
dublin
people
in
lieu
of
news
it
had
to
serve
many
dublin
people
in
place
of
bread
the
of
may
the
book
is
finished
and
so
far
as
ireland
is
immediately
concerned
the
insurrection
is
over
action
now
lies
with
england
and
on
that
action
depends
whether
the
irish
insurrection
is
over
or
only
suppressed
in
their
dealings
with
this
country
english
statesmen
have
seldom
shown
political
imagination
sometimes
they
have
been
just
sometimes
and
often
unjust
after
a
certain
point
i
dislike
and
despise
justice
it
is
an
attribute
of
god
and
is
adequately
managed
by
him
alone
but
between
man
and
man
no
other
ethics
save
that
of
kindness
can
give
results
i
have
not
any
hope
that
this
ethic
will
replace
that
and
i
merely
mention
it
in
order
that
the
good
people
who
read
these
words
may
enjoy
the
laugh
which
their
digestion
needs
i
have
faith
in
man
i
have
very
little
faith
in
states
man
but
i
believe
that
the
world
moves
and
i
believe
that
the
weight
of
the
rolling
planet
is
going
to
bring
freedom
to
ireland
indeed
i
name
this
date
as
the
first
day
of
irish
freedom
and
the
knowledge
forbids
me
mourn
too
deeply
my
friends
who
are
dead
it
may
not
be
worthy
of
mention
but
the
truth
is
that
ireland
is
not
cowed
she
is
excited
a
little
she
is
gay
a
little
she
was
not
with
the
revolution
but
in
a
few
months
she
will
be
and
her
heart
which
was
withering
will
be
warmed
by
the
knowledge
that
men
have
thought
her
worth
dying
for
she
will
prepare
to
make
herself
worthy
of
devotion
and
that
devotion
will
never
fail
her
so
little
does
it
take
to
raise
our
hearts
does
it
avail
anything
to
describe
these
things
to
english
readers
they
have
never
moved
the
english
mind
to
anything
except
impatience
but
and
at
this
desperate
conjunction
they
may
be
less
futile
than
heretofore
england
also
has
grown
patriotic
even
by
necessity
it
is
necessity
alone
makes
patriots
for
in
times
of
peace
a
patriot
is
a
quack
when
he
is
not
a
shark
idealism
pays
in
times
of
peace
it
dies
in
time
of
war
our
idealists
are
dead
and
yours
are
dying
hourly
the
english
mind
may
be
enabled
to
understand
what
is
wrong
with
us
and
why
through
centuries
we
have
been
disthressful
let
them
look
at
us
i
do
not
say
through
the
fumes
that
are
still
rising
from
our
ruined
streets
but
through
the
smoke
that
is
rolling
from
the
north
sea
to
switzerland
and
read
in
their
own
souls
the
justification
for
all
our
risings
and
for
this
rising
is
it
wrong
to
say
that
england
has
not
one
friend
in
europe
i
say
it
her
allies
of
were
her
enemies
of
yesterday
and
politics
alone
will
decide
what
they
will
be
i
say
it
and
yet
i
am
not
entirely
right
for
she
has
one
possible
friend
unless
she
should
decide
that
even
one
friend
is
excessive
and
irks
her
that
one
possible
friend
is
ireland
i
say
and
with
assurance
that
if
our
national
questions
are
arranged
there
will
remain
no
reason
for
enmity
between
the
two
countries
and
there
will
remain
many
reasons
for
friendship
it
may
be
objected
that
the
friendship
of
a
country
such
as
ireland
has
little
value
that
she
is
too
small
geographically
and
too
thinly
populated
to
give
aid
to
any
one
only
sixty
odd
years
ago
our
population
was
close
on
ten
millions
of
people
nor
are
we
yet
sterile
in
area
ireland
is
not
collossal
but
neither
is
she
microscopic
shaw
has
spoken
of
her
as
a
cabbage
patch
at
the
back
of
beyond
on
this
kind
of
description
rome
might
be
called
a
and
greece
a
back
yard
the
sober
fact
is
that
ireland
has
a
larger
geographical
area
than
many
an
independent
and
prosperous
european
kingdom
and
for
all
human
and
social
needs
she
is
a
fairly
big
country
and
is
beautiful
and
fertile
to
boot
she
could
be
made
worth
knowing
if
goodwill
and
trust
are
available
for
the
task
i
believe
that
what
is
known
as
the
mastery
of
the
seas
will
when
the
great
war
is
finished
pass
irretrievably
from
the
hands
or
the
ambition
of
any
nation
and
that
more
urgently
than
ever
in
her
history
england
will
have
need
of
a
friend
it
is
true
that
we
might
be
her
enemy
and
might
do
her
some
small
harm
it
is
truer
that
we
could
be
her
friend
and
could
be
of
very
real
assistance
to
her
should
the
english
statesman
decide
that
our
friendship
is
worth
having
let
him
create
a
little
of
the
political
imagination
already
spoken
of
let
him
equip
us
it
is
england
debt
to
ireland
for
freedom
not
in
the
manner
of
a
miser
who
arranges
for
the
chilly
livelihood
of
a
needy
female
relative
but
the
way
a
wealthy
father
would
undertake
the
settlement
of
his
son
i
fear
i
am
assisting
my
reader
to
laugh
too
much
but
laughter
is
the
sole
excess
that
is
wholesome
if
freedom
is
to
come
to
ireland
as
i
believe
it
is
then
the
easter
insurrection
was
the
only
thing
that
could
have
happened
i
speak
as
an
irishman
and
am
momentarily
leaving
out
of
account
every
other
consideration
if
after
all
her
striving
freedom
had
come
to
her
as
a
gift
as
a
peaceful
present
such
as
is
sometimes
given
away
with
a
pound
of
tea
ireland
would
have
accepted
the
gift
with
shamefacedness
and
have
felt
that
her
centuries
of
revolt
had
ended
in
something
very
like
ridicule
the
blood
of
brave
men
had
to
sanctify
such
a
consummation
if
the
national
imagination
was
to
be
stirred
to
the
dreadful
business
which
is
the
organizing
of
freedom
and
both
imagination
and
brains
have
been
stagnant
in
ireland
this
many
a
year
following
on
such
tameness
failure
might
have
been
predicted
or
at
least
feared
and
war
let
us
call
it
war
for
the
sake
of
our
pride
was
due
to
ireland
before
she
could
enter
gallantly
on
her
inheritance
we
might
have
crept
into
liberty
like
some
kind
of
domesticated
man
whereas
now
we
may
be
allowed
to
march
into
freedom
with
the
honours
of
war
i
am
still
appealing
to
the
political
imagination
for
if
england
allows
ireland
to
formally
make
peace
with
her
that
peace
will
be
lasting
everlasting
but
if
the
liberty
you
give
us
is
all
and
distrusts
and
stinginesses
then
what
is
scarcely
worth
accepting
will
hardly
be
worth
thanking
you
for
there
is
a
reference
in
the
earlier
pages
of
this
record
to
a
letter
which
i
addressed
to
george
bernard
shaw
and
published
in
the
this
was
a
thoughtless
letter
and
subsequent
events
have
proved
that
it
was
unmeaning
and
ridiculous
i
have
since
through
the
same
hospitable
journal
apologised
to
shaw
but
have
let
my
reference
to
the
matter
stand
as
an
indication
that
electricity
was
already
in
the
air
every
statement
i
made
about
him
in
that
letter
and
in
this
book
was
erroneous
for
afterwards
when
it
would
have
been
politic
to
run
for
cover
he
ran
for
the
open
and
he
spoke
there
like
the
valiant
thinker
and
great
irishman
that
he
is
since
the
foregoing
was
written
events
have
moved
in
this
country
the
situation
is
no
longer
the
same
the
executions
have
taken
place
one
can
not
justly
exclaim
against
the
measures
adopted
by
the
military
tribunal
and
yet
in
the
interests
of
both
countries
one
may
deplore
them
i
have
said
there
was
no
bitterness
in
ireland
and
it
was
true
at
the
time
of
writing
it
is
no
longer
true
but
it
is
still
possible
by
generous
statesmanship
to
allay
this
and
to
seal
a
true
union
between
ireland
and
england
the
insurrection
in
dublin
chapter
i
monday
this
has
taken
everyone
by
surprise
it
is
possible
that
with
the
exception
of
their
staff
it
has
taken
the
volunteers
themselves
by
surprise
but
our
peaceful
city
is
no
longer
peaceful
guns
are
sounding
or
rolling
and
crackling
from
different
directions
and
although
rarely
the
rattle
of
machine
guns
can
be
heard
also
two
days
ago
war
seemed
very
far
away
so
far
that
i
have
covenanted
with
myself
to
learn
the
alphabet
of
music
tom
bodkin
had
promised
to
present
me
with
a
musical
instrument
called
a
dulcimer
i
persist
in
thinking
that
this
is
a
species
of
guitar
although
i
am
assured
that
it
is
a
number
of
small
metal
plates
which
are
struck
with
sticks
and
i
confess
that
this
description
of
its
function
prejudices
me
more
than
a
little
against
it
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
think
dubiously
of
such
an
instrument
but
i
do
not
relish
the
idea
of
procuring
music
with
a
stick
with
this
dulcimer
i
shall
be
able
to
tap
out
our
irish
melodies
when
i
am
abroad
and
transport
myself
to
ireland
for
a
few
minutes
or
a
few
bars
in
preparation
for
this
present
i
had
through
saturday
and
sunday
been
learning
the
notes
of
the
scale
the
notes
and
spaces
on
the
lines
did
not
trouble
me
much
but
those
above
and
below
the
line
seemed
ingenious
and
complicated
to
a
degree
that
frightened
me
on
saturday
i
got
the
and
found
in
it
a
long
article
by
bernard
shaw
reprinted
from
the
york
one
reads
things
written
by
shaw
why
one
does
read
them
i
do
not
know
exactly
except
that
it
is
a
habit
we
got
into
years
ago
and
we
read
an
article
by
shaw
just
as
we
put
on
our
boots
in
the
morning
that
is
without
thinking
about
it
and
without
any
idea
of
reward
his
article
angered
me
exceedingly
it
was
called
irish
nonsense
talked
in
ireland
it
was
written
as
is
almost
all
of
his
journalistic
work
with
that
which
he
has
cultivated
it
is
his
mannerism
and
which
is
essentially
hypocritical
and
untrue
it
is
that
attitude
that
shop
attitude
that
attitude
which
is
the
tone
of
a
or
a
man
that
was
the
tone
of
shaw
article
i
wrote
an
open
letter
to
him
which
i
sent
to
the
because
i
doubted
that
the
dublin
papers
would
print
it
if
i
sent
it
to
them
and
i
knew
that
the
irish
people
who
read
the
other
papers
had
never
heard
of
shaw
except
as
a
under
which
very
good
limerick
bacon
is
sold
and
that
they
would
not
be
interested
in
the
opinions
of
a
person
named
shaw
on
any
subject
not
relevant
to
bacon
i
struck
out
of
my
letter
a
good
many
harsh
things
which
i
said
of
him
and
hoped
he
would
reply
to
it
in
order
that
i
could
furnish
these
acidities
to
him
in
a
second
letter
that
was
saturday
on
sunday
i
had
to
go
to
my
office
as
the
director
was
absent
in
london
and
there
i
applied
myself
to
the
notes
and
spaces
below
the
stave
but
relinquished
the
exercise
convinced
that
these
mysteries
were
unattainable
by
man
while
the
knowledge
that
above
the
stave
there
were
others
and
not
less
complex
stayed
mournfully
with
me
i
returned
home
and
as
novels
perhaps
it
is
only
for
the
duration
of
the
war
do
not
now
interest
me
i
read
for
some
time
in
madame
blavatsky
secret
doctrine
which
book
interests
me
profoundly
george
russell
was
out
of
town
or
i
would
have
gone
round
to
his
house
in
the
evening
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
about
shaw
and
to
listen
to
his
own
much
finer
ideas
on
that
as
on
every
other
subject
i
went
to
bed
on
the
morning
following
i
awoke
into
full
insurrection
and
bloody
war
but
i
did
not
know
anything
about
it
it
was
bank
holiday
but
for
employments
such
as
mine
there
are
not
any
holidays
so
i
went
to
my
office
at
the
usual
hour
and
after
transacting
what
business
was
necessary
i
bent
myself
to
the
notes
above
and
below
the
stave
and
marvelled
anew
at
the
ingenuity
of
man
peace
was
in
the
building
and
if
any
of
the
attendants
had
knowledge
or
rumour
of
war
they
did
not
mention
it
to
me
at
one
i
went
to
lunch
passing
the
corner
of
merrion
row
i
saw
two
small
groups
of
people
these
people
were
regarding
steadfastly
in
the
direction
of
stephen
green
park
and
they
spoke
occasionally
to
one
another
with
that
detached
confidence
which
proved
they
were
mutually
unknown
i
also
but
without
approaching
them
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
green
i
saw
nothing
but
the
narrow
street
which
widened
to
the
park
some
few
people
were
standing
in
tentative
attitudes
and
all
looking
in
the
one
direction
as
i
turned
from
them
homewards
i
received
an
impression
of
silence
and
expectation
and
excitement
on
the
way
home
i
noticed
that
many
silent
people
were
standing
in
their
doorways
an
unusual
thing
in
dublin
outside
of
the
back
streets
the
glance
of
a
dublin
man
or
woman
conveys
generally
a
criticism
of
personal
appearance
and
is
a
little
hostile
to
the
passer
the
look
of
each
person
as
i
passed
was
steadfast
and
contained
an
enquiry
instead
of
a
criticism
i
felt
faintly
uneasy
but
withdrew
my
mind
to
a
meditation
which
i
had
covenanted
with
myself
to
perform
daily
and
passed
to
my
house
there
i
was
told
that
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
rifle
firing
all
the
morning
and
we
concluded
that
the
military
recruits
or
volunteer
detachments
were
practising
that
arm
my
return
to
business
was
by
the
way
i
had
already
come
at
the
corner
of
merrion
row
i
found
the
same
silent
groups
who
were
still
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
green
and
addressing
each
other
occasionally
with
the
detached
confidence
of
strangers
suddenly
and
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
addressed
one
of
these
silent
gazers
has
there
been
an
accident
said
i
indicated
the
people
standing
about
what
all
this
for
he
was
a
sleepy
man
about
years
of
age
with
a
blunt
red
moustache
and
the
distant
eyes
which
one
sees
in
sailors
he
looked
at
me
stared
at
me
as
at
a
person
from
a
different
country
he
grew
wakeful
and
vivid
do
you
know
said
he
and
then
he
saw
that
i
did
not
know
the
sinn
feiners
have
seized
the
city
this
morning
oh
said
i
he
continued
with
the
savage
earnestness
of
one
who
has
amazement
in
his
mouth
they
seized
the
city
at
eleven
this
morning
the
green
there
is
full
of
them
they
have
captured
the
castle
they
have
taken
the
post
office
my
god
said
i
staring
at
him
and
instantly
i
turned
and
went
running
towards
the
green
in
a
few
seconds
i
banished
astonishment
and
began
to
walk
as
i
drew
near
the
green
rifle
fire
began
like
whips
it
was
from
the
further
side
i
saw
that
the
gates
were
closed
and
men
were
standing
inside
with
guns
on
their
shoulders
i
passed
a
house
the
windows
of
which
were
smashed
in
as
i
went
by
a
man
in
civilian
clothes
slipped
through
the
park
gates
which
instantly
closed
behind
him
he
ran
towards
me
and
i
halted
he
was
carrying
two
small
packets
in
his
hand
he
passed
me
hurriedly
and
placing
his
leg
inside
the
broken
window
of
the
house
behind
me
he
disappeared
almost
immediately
another
man
in
civilian
clothes
appeared
from
the
broken
window
of
another
house
he
also
had
something
i
do
know
what
in
his
hand
he
ran
urgently
towards
the
gates
which
opened
admitted
him
and
closed
again
in
the
centre
of
this
side
of
the
park
a
rough
barricade
of
carts
and
motor
cars
had
been
sketched
it
was
still
full
of
gaps
behind
it
was
a
halted
tram
and
along
the
vistas
of
the
green
one
saw
other
trams
derelict
untenanted
i
came
to
the
barricade
as
i
reached
it
and
stood
by
the
shelbourne
hotel
which
it
faced
a
loud
cry
came
from
the
park
the
gates
opened
and
three
men
ran
out
two
of
them
held
rifles
with
fixed
bayonets
the
third
gripped
a
heavy
revolver
in
his
fist
they
ran
towards
a
motor
car
which
had
just
turned
the
corner
and
halted
it
the
men
with
bayonets
took
position
instantly
on
either
side
of
the
car
the
man
with
the
revolver
saluted
and
i
heard
him
begging
the
occupants
to
pardon
him
and
directing
them
to
dismount
a
man
and
woman
got
down
they
were
again
saluted
and
requested
to
go
to
the
sidewalk
they
did
so
note
as
i
pen
these
words
rifle
shot
is
cracking
from
three
different
directions
and
continually
three
minutes
ago
there
was
two
discharges
from
heavy
guns
these
are
the
first
heavy
guns
used
in
the
insurrection
april
the
man
crossed
and
stood
by
me
he
was
very
tall
and
thin
with
a
shaven
wasted
face
i
want
to
get
down
to
armagh
he
said
to
no
one
in
particular
the
loose
bluish
skin
under
his
eyes
was
twitching
the
volunteers
directed
the
chauffeur
to
drive
to
the
barricade
and
lodge
his
car
in
a
particular
position
there
he
did
it
awkwardly
and
after
three
attempts
he
succeeded
in
pleasing
them
he
was
a
big
man
whose
knees
were
rather
high
for
the
seat
he
was
in
and
they
jerked
with
the
speed
and
persistence
of
something
moved
with
a
powerful
spring
his
face
was
composed
and
fully
under
command
although
his
legs
were
not
he
locked
the
car
into
the
barricade
and
then
being
a
man
accustomed
to
be
commanded
he
awaited
an
order
to
descend
when
the
order
came
he
walked
directly
to
his
master
still
preserving
all
the
solemnity
of
his
features
these
two
men
did
not
address
a
word
to
each
other
but
their
drilled
and
expressionless
eyes
were
loud
with
surprise
and
fear
and
rage
they
went
into
the
hotel
i
spoke
to
the
man
with
the
revolver
he
was
no
more
than
a
boy
not
more
certainly
than
twenty
years
of
age
short
in
stature
with
close
curling
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
a
lad
the
strap
of
his
sombrero
had
torn
loose
on
one
side
and
except
while
he
held
it
in
his
teeth
it
flapped
about
his
chin
his
face
was
sunburnt
and
grimy
with
dust
and
sweat
this
young
man
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
acting
from
his
reason
he
was
doing
his
work
from
a
determination
implanted
previously
days
weeks
perhaps
on
his
imagination
his
mind
was
where
it
was
not
with
his
body
and
continually
his
eyes
went
searching
widely
looking
for
spaces
scanning
hastily
the
clouds
the
vistas
of
the
streets
looking
for
something
that
did
not
hinder
him
looking
away
for
a
moment
from
the
immediacies
and
rigours
which
were
impressed
where
his
mind
had
been
when
i
spoke
he
looked
at
me
and
i
know
that
for
some
seconds
he
did
not
see
me
i
said
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
what
has
happened
he
replied
collectedly
enough
in
speech
but
with
that
ramble
and
errancy
clouding
his
eyes
we
have
taken
the
city
we
are
expecting
an
attack
from
the
military
at
any
moment
and
those
people
he
indicated
knots
of
men
women
and
children
clustered
towards
the
end
of
the
green
wo
go
home
for
me
we
have
the
post
office
and
the
railways
and
the
castle
we
have
all
the
city
we
have
everything
some
men
and
two
women
drew
behind
me
to
listen
this
morning
said
he
the
police
rushed
us
one
ran
at
me
to
take
my
revolver
i
fired
but
i
missed
him
and
i
hit
a
you
have
far
too
much
talk
said
a
voice
to
the
young
man
i
turned
a
few
steps
away
and
glancing
back
saw
that
he
was
staring
after
me
but
i
know
that
he
did
not
see
me
he
was
looking
at
turmoil
and
blood
and
at
figures
that
ran
towards
him
and
ran
away
a
world
in
motion
and
he
in
the
centre
of
it
astonished
the
men
with
him
did
not
utter
a
sound
they
were
both
older
one
indeed
a
short
sturdy
man
had
a
heavy
white
moustache
he
was
quite
collected
and
took
no
notice
of
the
skies
or
the
spaces
he
saw
a
man
in
rubbers
placing
his
hand
on
a
motor
bicycle
in
the
barricade
and
called
to
him
instantly
let
that
alone
the
motorist
did
not
at
once
remove
his
hand
whereupon
the
man
gripped
his
gun
in
both
hands
and
ran
violently
towards
him
he
ran
directly
to
him
body
to
body
and
as
he
was
short
and
the
motorist
was
very
tall
stared
fixedly
up
in
his
face
he
roared
up
at
his
face
in
a
mighty
voice
are
you
deaf
are
you
deaf
move
back
the
motorist
moved
away
pursued
by
an
eye
as
steady
and
savage
as
the
point
of
the
bayonet
that
was
level
with
it
another
motor
car
came
round
the
ely
place
corner
of
the
green
and
wobbled
at
the
sight
of
the
barricade
the
three
men
who
had
returned
to
the
gates
roared
halt
but
the
driver
made
a
tentative
effort
to
turn
his
wheel
a
great
shout
of
many
voices
came
then
and
the
three
men
ran
to
him
drive
to
the
barricade
came
the
order
the
driver
turned
his
wheel
a
point
further
towards
escape
and
instantly
one
of
the
men
clapped
a
gun
to
the
wheel
and
blew
the
tyre
open
some
words
were
exchanged
and
then
a
shout
drive
it
on
the
rim
drive
it
the
tone
was
very
menacing
and
the
motorist
turned
his
car
slowly
to
the
barricade
and
placed
it
in
for
an
hour
i
tramped
the
city
seeing
everywhere
these
knots
of
watchful
strangers
speaking
together
in
low
tones
and
it
sank
into
my
mind
that
what
i
had
heard
was
true
and
that
the
city
was
in
insurrection
it
had
been
promised
for
so
long
and
had
been
threatened
for
so
long
now
it
was
here
i
had
seen
it
in
the
green
others
had
seen
it
in
other
parts
the
same
men
clad
in
dark
green
and
equipped
with
rifle
bayonet
and
bandolier
the
same
silent
activity
the
police
had
disappeared
from
the
streets
at
that
hour
i
did
not
see
one
policeman
nor
did
i
see
one
for
many
days
and
men
said
that
several
of
them
had
been
shot
earlier
in
the
morning
that
an
officer
had
been
shot
on
portobello
bridge
that
many
soldiers
had
been
killed
and
that
a
good
many
civilians
were
dead
also
around
me
as
i
walked
the
rumour
of
war
and
death
was
in
the
air
continually
and
from
every
direction
rifles
were
crackling
and
rolling
sometimes
there
was
only
one
shot
again
it
would
be
a
roll
of
firing
crested
with
single
short
explosions
and
sinking
again
to
snaps
and
echoes
then
for
a
moment
silence
and
then
again
the
guns
leaped
in
the
air
the
rumour
of
positions
bridges
public
places
railway
stations
government
offices
having
been
seized
was
persistent
and
was
not
denied
by
any
voice
i
met
some
few
people
i
knew
who
said
well
and
thrust
their
eyes
into
me
as
though
they
were
rummaging
me
for
information
but
there
were
not
very
many
people
in
the
streets
the
greater
part
of
the
population
were
away
on
bank
holiday
and
did
not
know
anything
of
this
business
many
of
them
would
not
know
anything
until
they
found
they
had
to
walk
home
from
kingstown
dalkey
howth
or
wherever
they
were
i
returned
to
my
office
decided
that
i
would
close
it
for
the
day
the
men
were
very
relieved
when
i
came
in
and
were
more
relieved
when
i
ordered
the
gong
to
be
sounded
there
were
some
few
people
in
the
place
and
they
were
soon
put
out
the
outer
gates
were
locked
and
the
great
door
but
i
kept
the
men
on
duty
until
the
evening
we
were
the
last
public
institution
open
all
the
others
had
been
closed
for
hours
i
went
upstairs
and
sat
down
but
had
barely
reached
the
chair
before
i
stood
up
again
and
began
to
pace
my
room
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
amazed
expectant
inquiet
turning
my
ear
to
the
shots
and
my
mind
to
speculations
that
began
in
the
middle
and
were
chased
from
there
by
others
before
they
had
taken
one
thought
forward
but
then
i
took
myself
resolutely
and
sat
me
down
and
i
pencilled
out
exercises
above
the
stave
and
under
the
stave
and
discovered
suddenly
that
i
was
again
marching
the
floor
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
with
thoughts
bursting
about
my
head
as
though
they
were
fired
on
me
from
concealed
batteries
at
five
i
left
i
met
miss
all
of
whose
rumours
coincided
with
those
i
had
gathered
she
was
in
exceeding
good
humour
and
interested
leaving
her
i
met
cy
and
we
turned
together
up
to
the
green
as
we
proceeded
the
sound
of
firing
grew
more
distinct
but
when
we
reached
the
green
it
died
away
again
we
stood
a
little
below
the
shelbourne
hotel
looking
at
the
barricade
and
into
the
park
we
could
see
nothing
not
a
volunteer
was
in
sight
the
green
seemed
a
desert
there
were
only
the
trees
to
be
seen
and
through
them
small
green
vistas
of
sward
just
then
a
man
stepped
on
the
footpath
and
walked
directly
to
the
barricade
he
stopped
and
gripped
the
shafts
of
a
lorry
lodged
near
the
centre
at
that
instant
the
park
exploded
into
life
and
sound
from
nowhere
armed
men
appeared
at
the
railings
and
they
all
shouted
at
the
man
put
down
that
lorry
let
out
and
go
away
let
out
at
once
these
were
the
cries
the
man
did
not
let
out
he
halted
with
the
shafts
in
his
hand
and
looked
towards
the
vociferous
pailings
then
and
very
slowly
he
began
to
draw
the
lorry
out
of
the
barricade
the
shouts
came
to
him
again
very
loud
very
threatening
but
he
did
not
attend
to
them
he
is
the
man
that
owns
the
lorry
said
a
voice
beside
me
dead
silence
fell
on
the
people
around
while
the
man
slowly
drew
his
cart
down
by
the
footpath
then
three
shots
rang
out
in
succession
at
the
distance
he
could
not
be
missed
and
it
was
obvious
they
were
trying
to
frighten
him
he
dropped
the
shafts
and
instead
of
going
away
he
walked
over
to
the
volunteers
he
has
a
nerve
said
another
voice
behind
me
the
man
walked
directly
towards
the
volunteers
who
to
the
number
of
about
ten
were
lining
the
railings
he
walked
slowly
bent
a
little
forward
with
one
hand
raised
and
one
finger
up
as
though
he
were
going
to
make
a
speech
ten
guns
were
pointing
at
him
and
a
voice
repeated
many
times
go
and
put
back
that
lorry
or
you
are
a
dead
man
go
before
i
count
four
one
two
three
four
a
rifle
spat
at
him
and
in
two
undulating
movements
the
man
sank
on
himself
and
sagged
to
the
ground
i
ran
to
him
with
some
others
while
a
woman
screamed
unmeaningly
all
on
one
strident
note
the
man
was
picked
up
and
carried
to
a
hospital
beside
the
arts
club
there
was
a
hole
in
the
top
of
his
head
and
one
does
not
know
how
ugly
blood
can
look
until
it
has
been
seen
clotted
in
hair
as
the
poor
man
was
being
carried
in
a
woman
plumped
to
her
knees
in
the
road
and
began
not
to
scream
but
to
screetch
at
that
moment
the
volunteers
were
hated
the
men
by
whom
i
was
and
who
were
lifting
the
body
roared
into
the
railings
we
be
coming
back
for
you
damn
you
from
the
railings
there
came
no
reply
and
in
an
instant
the
place
was
again
desert
and
silent
and
the
little
green
vistas
were
slumbering
among
the
trees
no
one
seemed
able
to
estimate
the
number
of
men
inside
the
green
and
through
the
day
no
considerable
body
of
men
had
been
seen
only
those
who
held
the
gates
and
the
small
parties
of
threes
and
fours
who
arrested
motors
and
carts
for
their
barricades
among
these
were
some
who
were
only
infants
one
boy
seemed
about
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
strutting
the
centre
of
the
road
with
a
large
revolver
in
his
small
fist
a
motor
car
came
by
him
containing
three
men
and
in
the
shortest
of
time
he
had
the
car
lodged
in
his
barricade
and
dismissed
its
stupified
occupants
with
a
wave
of
his
armed
hand
the
knots
were
increasing
about
the
streets
for
now
the
bank
holiday
people
began
to
wander
back
from
places
that
were
not
distant
and
to
them
it
had
all
to
be
explained
anew
free
movement
was
possible
everywhere
in
the
city
but
the
constant
crackle
of
rifles
restricted
somewhat
that
freedom
up
to
one
at
night
belated
travellers
were
straggling
into
the
city
and
curious
people
were
wandering
from
group
to
group
still
trying
to
gather
information
i
remained
awake
until
four
in
the
morning
every
five
minutes
a
rifle
cracked
somewhere
but
about
a
quarter
to
twelve
sharp
volleying
came
from
the
direction
of
portobello
bridge
and
died
away
after
some
time
the
windows
of
my
flat
listen
out
towards
the
green
and
obliquely
towards
sackville
street
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
there
were
volleys
from
stephen
green
direction
and
this
continued
with
intensity
for
about
minutes
then
it
fell
into
a
sputter
of
fire
and
ceased
i
went
to
bed
about
four
convinced
that
the
green
had
been
rushed
by
the
military
and
captured
and
that
the
rising
was
at
an
end
that
was
the
first
day
of
the
insurrection
chapter
ii
tuesday
a
sultry
lowering
day
and
dusk
skies
fat
with
rain
i
left
for
my
office
believing
that
the
insurrection
was
at
an
end
at
a
corner
i
asked
a
man
was
it
all
finished
he
said
it
was
not
and
that
if
anything
it
was
worse
on
this
day
the
rumours
began
and
i
think
it
will
be
many
a
year
before
the
rumours
cease
the
published
an
edition
which
contained
nothing
but
an
official
proclamation
that
persons
had
disturbed
the
peace
and
that
the
situation
was
well
in
hand
the
news
stated
in
three
lines
that
there
was
a
sinn
fein
rising
in
dublin
and
that
the
rest
of
the
country
was
quiet
no
english
or
country
papers
came
there
was
no
delivery
or
collection
of
letters
all
the
shops
in
the
city
were
shut
there
was
no
traffic
of
any
kind
in
the
streets
there
was
no
way
of
gathering
any
kind
of
information
and
rumour
gave
all
the
news
it
seemed
that
the
military
and
the
government
had
been
taken
unawares
it
was
bank
holiday
and
many
military
officers
had
gone
to
the
races
or
were
away
on
leave
and
prominent
members
of
the
irish
government
had
gone
to
england
on
sunday
it
appeared
that
everything
claimed
on
the
previous
day
was
true
and
that
the
city
of
dublin
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
volunteers
they
had
taken
and
sacked
jacob
biscuit
factory
and
had
converted
it
into
a
fort
which
they
held
they
had
the
post
office
and
were
building
baricades
around
it
ten
feet
high
of
sandbags
cases
wire
entanglements
they
had
pushed
out
all
the
windows
and
sandbagged
them
to
half
their
height
while
of
food
vegetables
and
ammunition
were
going
in
continually
they
had
dug
trenches
and
were
laying
siege
to
one
of
the
city
barracks
it
was
current
that
intercourse
between
germany
and
ireland
had
been
frequent
chiefly
by
means
of
submarines
which
came
up
near
the
coast
and
landed
machine
guns
rifles
and
ammunition
it
was
believed
also
that
the
whole
country
had
risen
and
that
many
strong
places
and
cities
were
in
the
hands
of
the
volunteers
cork
barracks
was
said
to
be
taken
while
the
officers
were
away
at
the
curragh
races
that
the
men
without
officers
were
disorganised
and
the
place
easily
captured
it
was
said
that
germans
thousands
strong
had
landed
and
that
many
irish
americans
with
german
officers
had
arrived
also
with
full
military
equipment
on
the
previous
day
the
volunteers
had
proclaimed
the
irish
republic
this
ceremony
was
conducted
from
the
mansion
house
steps
and
the
manifesto
was
said
to
have
been
read
by
pearse
of
enda
the
republican
and
volunteer
flag
was
hoisted
on
the
mansion
house
the
latter
consisted
of
vertical
colours
of
green
white
and
orange
kerry
wireless
station
was
reported
captured
and
news
of
the
republic
flashed
abroad
these
rumours
were
flying
in
the
street
it
was
also
reported
that
two
transports
had
come
in
the
night
and
had
landed
from
england
about
soldiers
an
attack
reported
on
the
post
office
by
a
troop
of
lancers
who
were
received
with
fire
and
repulsed
it
is
foolish
to
send
cavalry
into
street
war
in
connection
with
this
lancer
charge
at
the
post
office
it
is
said
that
the
people
and
especially
the
women
sided
with
the
soldiers
and
that
the
volunteers
were
assailed
by
these
women
with
bricks
bottles
sticks
to
cries
of
would
you
be
hurting
the
poor
men
there
were
other
angry
ladies
who
threatened
volunteers
addressing
to
them
this
petrifying
query
would
you
be
hurting
the
poor
horses
indeed
the
best
people
in
the
world
live
in
dublin
the
lancers
retreated
to
the
bottom
of
sackville
street
where
they
remained
for
some
time
in
the
centre
of
a
crowd
who
were
carressing
their
horses
it
may
have
seemed
to
them
a
rather
curious
kind
of
insurrection
that
is
if
they
were
strangers
to
ireland
in
the
post
office
neighbourhood
the
volunteers
had
some
difficulty
in
dealing
with
the
people
who
surged
about
them
while
they
were
preparing
the
barricade
and
hindered
them
to
some
little
extent
one
of
the
volunteers
was
particularly
noticeable
he
held
a
lady
umbrella
in
his
hand
and
whenever
some
person
became
particularly
annoying
he
would
leap
the
barricade
and
chase
his
man
half
a
street
hitting
him
over
the
head
with
the
umbrella
it
was
said
that
the
wonder
of
the
world
was
not
that
ireland
was
at
war
but
that
after
many
hours
the
umbrella
was
still
unbroken
a
volunteer
night
attack
on
the
quays
was
spoken
of
whereat
the
military
were
said
to
have
been
taken
by
surprise
and
six
carts
of
their
ammunition
captured
this
was
probably
untrue
also
that
the
volunteers
had
blown
up
the
arsenal
in
the
phoenix
park
there
had
been
looting
in
the
night
about
sackville
street
and
it
was
current
that
the
volunteers
had
shot
twenty
of
the
looters
the
shops
attacked
were
mainly
haberdashers
shoe
shops
and
sweet
shops
very
many
sweet
shops
were
raided
and
until
the
end
of
the
rising
sweet
shops
were
the
favourite
mark
of
the
looters
there
is
something
comical
in
this
looting
of
sweet
shops
something
almost
innocent
and
possibly
most
of
the
looters
are
children
who
are
having
the
sole
gorge
of
their
lives
they
have
tasted
sweetstuffs
they
had
never
toothed
before
and
will
never
taste
again
in
this
life
and
until
they
die
the
insurrection
of
will
have
a
sweet
savour
for
them
i
went
to
the
green
at
the
corner
of
merrion
row
a
horse
was
lying
on
the
footpath
surrounded
by
blood
he
bore
two
bullet
wounds
but
the
blood
came
from
his
throat
which
had
been
cut
inside
the
green
railings
four
bodies
could
be
seen
lying
on
the
ground
they
were
dead
volunteers
the
rain
was
falling
now
persistently
and
persistently
from
the
green
and
from
the
shelbourne
hotel
snipers
were
exchanging
bullets
some
distance
beyond
the
shelbourne
i
saw
another
volunteer
stretched
out
on
a
seat
just
within
the
railings
he
was
not
dead
for
now
and
again
his
hand
moved
feebly
in
a
gesture
for
aid
the
hand
was
completely
red
with
blood
his
face
could
not
be
seen
he
was
just
a
limp
mass
upon
which
the
rain
beat
pitilessly
and
he
was
sodden
and
shapeless
and
most
miserable
to
see
his
companions
could
not
draw
him
in
for
the
spot
was
covered
by
the
snipers
from
the
shelbourne
bystanders
stated
that
several
attempts
had
already
been
made
to
rescue
him
but
that
he
would
have
to
remain
there
until
the
fall
of
night
from
trinity
college
windows
and
roof
there
was
also
sniping
but
the
shelbourne
hotel
riflemen
must
have
seriously
troubled
the
volunteers
in
the
green
as
i
went
back
i
stayed
a
while
in
front
of
the
hotel
to
count
the
shots
that
had
struck
the
windows
there
were
fourteen
shots
through
the
ground
windows
the
holes
were
clean
through
each
surrounded
by
a
star
the
bullets
went
through
but
did
not
crack
the
glass
there
were
three
places
in
which
the
windows
had
holes
half
a
foot
to
a
foot
wide
and
high
here
many
rifles
must
have
fired
at
the
one
moment
it
must
have
been
as
awkward
inside
the
shelbourne
hotel
as
it
was
inside
the
green
a
lady
who
lived
in
baggot
street
said
she
had
been
up
all
night
and
with
her
neighbours
had
supplied
tea
and
bread
to
the
soldiers
who
were
lining
the
street
the
officer
to
whom
she
spoke
had
made
two
or
three
attacks
to
draw
fire
and
estimate
the
volunteers
positions
numbers
and
he
told
her
that
he
considered
there
were
volunteers
in
the
green
and
as
he
had
only
soldiers
he
could
not
afford
to
deliver
a
real
attack
and
was
merely
containing
them
amiens
street
station
reported
recaptured
by
the
military
other
stations
are
said
to
be
still
in
the
volunteers
possession
the
story
goes
that
about
twelve
on
monday
an
english
officer
had
marched
into
the
post
office
and
demanded
two
penny
stamps
from
the
amazed
volunteers
who
were
inside
he
thought
their
uniforms
were
postal
uniforms
they
brought
him
in
and
he
is
probably
still
trying
to
get
a
perspective
on
the
occurrence
they
had
as
prisoners
in
the
post
office
a
certain
number
of
soldiers
and
rumour
had
it
that
these
men
accommodated
themselves
quickly
to
duress
and
were
busily
engaged
peeling
potatoes
for
the
meal
which
they
would
partake
of
later
on
with
the
volunteers
earlier
in
the
day
i
met
a
wild
individual
who
spat
rumour
as
though
his
mouth
were
a
machine
gun
or
a
linotype
machine
he
believed
everything
he
heard
and
everything
he
heard
became
as
by
magic
favourable
to
his
hopes
which
were
violently
one
unfavourable
rumour
was
instantly
crushed
by
him
with
three
stories
which
were
favourable
and
triumphantly
so
he
said
the
germans
had
landed
in
three
places
one
of
these
landings
alone
consisted
of
fifteen
thousand
men
the
other
landings
probably
beat
that
figure
the
whole
city
of
cork
was
in
the
hands
of
the
volunteers
and
to
that
extent
might
be
said
to
be
peaceful
german
warships
had
defeated
the
english
and
their
transports
were
speeding
from
every
side
the
whole
country
was
up
and
the
garrison
was
by
one
hundred
to
one
these
dublin
barracks
which
had
not
been
taken
were
now
besieged
and
on
the
point
of
surrender
i
think
this
man
created
and
winged
every
rumour
that
flew
in
dublin
and
he
was
the
sole
individual
whom
i
heard
definitely
taking
a
side
he
left
me
and
looking
back
i
saw
him
pouring
his
news
into
the
ear
of
a
gaping
stranger
whom
he
had
arrested
for
the
purpose
i
almost
went
back
to
hear
would
he
tell
the
same
tale
or
would
he
elaborate
it
into
a
new
thing
for
i
am
interested
in
the
art
of
at
eleven
the
rain
ceased
and
to
it
succeeded
a
beautiful
night
gusty
with
wind
and
packed
with
sailing
clouds
and
stars
we
were
expecting
visitors
this
night
but
the
sound
of
guns
may
have
warned
most
people
away
three
only
came
and
with
them
we
listened
from
my
window
to
the
guns
at
the
green
challenging
and
replying
to
each
other
and
to
where
further
away
the
trinity
snipers
were
crackling
and
beyond
again
to
the
sounds
of
war
from
sackville
street
the
firing
was
fairly
heavy
and
often
the
short
rattle
of
machine
guns
could
be
heard
one
of
the
stories
told
was
that
the
volunteers
had
taken
the
south
dublin
union
workhouse
occupied
it
and
trenched
the
grounds
they
were
heavily
attacked
by
the
military
who
at
a
loss
of
men
took
the
place
the
tale
went
that
towards
the
close
the
officer
in
command
offered
them
terms
of
surrender
but
the
volunteers
replied
that
they
were
not
there
to
surrender
they
were
there
to
be
killed
the
garrison
consisted
of
fifty
men
and
the
story
said
that
fifty
men
were
killed
chapter
iii
wednesday
it
was
three
before
i
got
to
sleep
last
night
and
during
the
hours
machine
guns
and
rifle
firing
had
been
continuous
this
morning
the
sun
is
shining
brilliantly
and
the
movement
in
the
streets
possesses
more
of
animation
than
it
has
done
the
movement
ends
always
in
a
knot
of
people
and
folk
go
from
group
to
group
vainly
seeking
information
and
quite
content
if
the
rumour
they
presently
gather
differs
even
a
little
from
the
one
they
have
just
communicated
the
first
statement
i
heard
was
that
the
green
had
been
taken
by
the
military
the
second
that
it
had
been
the
third
that
it
had
not
been
taken
at
all
the
facts
at
last
emerged
that
the
green
had
not
been
occupied
by
the
soldiers
but
that
the
volunteers
had
retreated
from
it
into
a
house
which
commanded
it
this
was
found
to
be
the
college
of
surgeons
and
from
the
windows
and
roof
of
this
college
they
were
sniping
a
machine
gun
was
mounted
on
the
roof
other
machine
guns
however
opposed
them
from
the
roofs
of
the
shelbourne
hotel
the
united
service
club
and
the
alexandra
club
thus
a
triangular
duel
opened
between
these
positions
across
the
trees
of
the
park
through
the
railings
of
the
green
some
rifles
and
bandoliers
could
be
seen
lying
on
the
ground
as
also
the
deserted
trenches
and
holes
small
boys
bolted
in
to
see
these
sights
and
bolted
out
again
with
bullets
quickening
their
feet
small
boys
do
not
believe
that
people
will
really
kill
them
but
small
boys
were
killed
the
dead
horse
was
still
lying
stiff
and
lamentable
on
the
footpath
this
morning
a
gunboat
came
up
the
liffey
and
helped
to
bombard
liberty
hall
the
hall
is
breeched
and
useless
rumour
says
that
it
was
empty
at
the
time
and
that
connolly
with
his
men
had
marched
long
before
to
the
post
office
and
the
green
the
same
source
of
information
relates
that
three
thousand
volunteers
came
from
belfast
on
an
excursion
train
and
that
they
marched
into
the
post
office
on
this
day
only
one
of
my
men
came
in
he
said
that
he
had
gone
on
the
roof
and
had
been
shot
at
consequently
that
the
volunteers
held
some
of
the
covering
houses
i
went
to
the
roof
and
remained
there
for
half
an
hour
there
were
no
shots
but
the
firing
from
the
direction
of
sackville
street
was
continuous
and
at
times
exceedingly
heavy
the
was
published
it
contained
a
new
military
proclamation
and
a
statement
that
the
country
was
peaceful
and
told
that
in
sackville
street
some
houses
were
burned
to
the
ground
on
the
outside
railings
a
bill
proclaiming
martial
law
was
posted
into
the
newspaper
statement
that
peace
reigned
in
the
country
one
was
inclined
to
read
more
of
disquietude
than
of
truth
and
one
said
is
the
country
so
extraordinarily
peaceful
that
it
can
be
dismissed
in
three
lines
there
is
too
much
peace
or
too
much
reticence
but
it
will
be
some
time
before
we
hear
from
outside
of
dublin
meanwhile
the
sun
was
shining
it
was
a
delightful
day
and
the
streets
outside
and
around
the
areas
of
fire
were
animated
and
even
gay
in
the
streets
of
dublin
there
were
no
morose
faces
to
be
seen
almost
everyone
was
smiling
and
attentive
and
a
democratic
feeling
was
abroad
to
which
our
city
is
very
much
a
stranger
for
while
in
private
we
are
a
sociable
and
talkative
people
we
have
no
street
manners
or
public
ease
whatever
every
person
spoke
to
every
other
person
and
men
and
women
mixed
and
talked
without
constraint
was
the
city
for
or
against
the
volunteers
was
it
for
the
volunteers
and
yet
against
the
rising
it
is
considered
now
writing
a
day
or
two
afterwards
that
dublin
was
entirely
against
the
volunteers
but
on
the
day
of
which
i
write
no
such
certainty
could
be
put
forward
there
was
a
singular
reticence
on
the
subject
men
met
and
talked
volubly
but
they
said
nothing
that
indicated
a
personal
desire
or
belief
they
asked
for
and
exchanged
the
latest
news
or
rather
rumour
and
while
expressions
were
frequent
of
astonishment
at
the
suddenness
and
completeness
of
the
occurrence
no
expression
of
opinion
for
or
against
was
anywhere
formulated
sometimes
a
man
said
they
will
be
beaten
of
course
and
as
he
prophesied
the
neighbour
might
surmise
if
he
did
so
with
a
sad
heart
or
a
merry
one
but
they
knew
nothing
and
asked
nothing
of
his
views
and
themselves
advanced
no
flag
this
was
among
the
men
the
women
were
less
guarded
or
perhaps
knew
they
had
less
to
fear
most
of
the
female
opinion
i
heard
was
not
alone
unfavourable
but
actively
and
viciously
hostile
to
the
rising
this
was
noticeable
among
the
best
dressed
class
of
our
population
the
worst
dressed
indeed
the
female
dregs
of
dublin
life
expressed
a
like
antagonism
and
almost
in
similar
language
the
view
expressed
was
i
hope
every
man
of
them
will
be
shot
and
they
ought
to
be
all
shot
shooting
indeed
was
proceeding
everywhere
during
daylight
at
least
the
sound
is
not
sinister
nor
depressing
and
the
thought
that
perhaps
a
life
had
exploded
with
that
crack
is
not
depressing
either
in
the
last
two
years
of
our
ideas
on
death
have
undergone
a
change
it
is
not
now
the
furtive
thing
that
crawled
into
your
bed
and
which
you
fought
with
and
medicine
bottles
it
has
become
again
a
rider
of
the
wind
whom
you
may
go
coursing
with
through
the
fields
and
open
places
all
the
morbidity
is
gone
and
the
sickness
and
what
remains
to
death
is
now
health
and
excitement
so
dublin
laughed
at
the
noise
of
its
own
bombardment
and
made
no
moan
about
its
dead
in
the
sunlight
afterwards
in
the
rooms
when
the
night
fell
and
instead
of
silence
that
mechanical
barking
of
the
maxims
and
the
whistle
and
screams
of
the
rifles
the
solemn
roar
of
the
heavier
guns
and
the
red
glare
covering
the
sky
it
is
possible
that
in
the
night
dublin
did
not
laugh
and
that
she
was
gay
in
the
sunlight
for
no
other
reason
than
that
the
night
was
past
on
this
day
fighting
was
incessant
at
mount
street
bridge
a
party
of
volunteers
had
seized
three
houses
covering
the
bridge
and
converted
these
into
forts
it
is
reported
that
military
casualties
at
this
point
were
very
heavy
the
volunteers
are
said
also
to
hold
the
south
dublin
union
the
soldiers
have
seized
guinness
brewery
while
their
opponents
have
seized
another
brewery
in
the
neighbourhood
and
between
these
two
there
is
a
continual
fusilade
fighting
is
brisk
about
ringsend
and
along
the
canal
dame
street
was
said
to
be
held
in
many
places
by
the
volunteers
i
went
down
dame
street
but
saw
no
volunteers
and
did
not
observe
any
sniping
from
the
houses
further
as
dame
street
is
entirely
commanded
by
the
roofs
and
windows
of
trinity
college
it
is
unlikely
that
they
should
be
here
it
was
curious
to
observe
this
at
other
times
so
animated
street
broad
and
deserted
with
at
the
corners
of
side
streets
small
knots
of
people
watching
seen
from
behind
grattan
statue
in
college
green
seemed
almost
alive
and
he
had
the
air
of
addressing
warnings
and
reproaches
to
trinity
college
the
proclamation
issued
warns
all
people
to
remain
within
doors
until
five
in
the
morning
and
after
seven
at
night
it
is
still
early
there
is
no
news
of
any
kind
and
the
rumours
begin
to
catch
quickly
on
each
other
and
to
cancel
one
another
out
dublin
is
entirely
cut
off
from
england
and
from
the
outside
world
it
is
just
as
entirely
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
ireland
no
news
of
any
kind
filters
in
to
us
we
are
and
but
as
yet
it
does
not
much
matter
meantime
the
belief
grows
that
the
volunteers
may
be
able
to
hold
out
much
longer
than
had
been
imagined
the
idea
at
first
among
the
people
had
been
that
the
insurrection
would
be
ended
the
morning
after
it
had
began
but
the
insurrection
having
lasted
three
days
people
are
ready
to
conceive
that
it
may
last
for
ever
there
is
almost
a
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
the
volunteers
because
they
are
holding
out
for
a
little
while
for
had
they
been
beaten
the
first
or
second
day
the
city
would
have
been
humiliated
to
the
soul
people
say
of
course
they
will
be
beaten
the
statement
is
almost
a
query
and
they
continue
but
they
are
putting
up
a
decent
fight
for
being
beaten
does
not
greatly
matter
in
ireland
but
not
fighting
does
matter
they
went
forth
always
to
the
battle
and
they
always
fell
indeed
the
history
of
the
irish
race
is
in
that
phrase
the
firing
from
the
roofs
of
trinity
college
became
violent
i
crossed
dame
street
some
distance
up
struck
down
the
quays
and
went
along
these
until
i
reached
the
ballast
office
further
than
this
it
was
not
possible
to
go
for
a
step
beyond
the
ballast
office
would
have
brought
one
into
the
unending
stream
of
lead
that
was
pouring
from
trinity
and
other
places
i
was
looking
on
bridge
and
sackville
street
and
the
house
facing
me
was
kelly
a
fishing
tackle
shop
one
half
of
which
was
on
the
quay
and
the
other
half
in
sackville
street
this
house
was
being
bombarded
i
counted
the
report
of
six
different
machine
guns
which
played
on
it
rifles
innumerable
and
from
every
sort
of
place
were
potting
its
windows
and
at
intervals
of
about
half
a
minute
the
shells
from
a
heavy
gun
lobbed
in
through
its
windows
or
thumped
mightily
against
its
walls
for
three
hours
that
bombardment
continued
and
the
walls
stood
in
a
cloud
of
red
dust
and
smoke
rifle
and
machine
gun
bullets
pattered
over
every
inch
of
it
and
unfailingly
the
heavy
gun
pounded
its
shells
through
the
windows
one
heart
melted
at
the
idea
that
human
beings
were
crouching
inside
that
volcano
of
death
and
i
said
to
myself
not
even
a
fly
can
be
alive
in
that
house
no
head
showed
at
any
window
no
rifle
cracked
from
window
or
roof
in
reply
the
house
was
dumb
lifeless
and
i
thought
every
one
of
those
men
are
dead
it
was
then
and
quite
suddenly
that
the
possibilities
of
street
fighting
flashed
on
me
and
i
knew
there
was
no
person
in
the
house
and
said
to
myself
they
have
smashed
through
the
walls
with
a
hatchet
and
are
sitting
in
the
next
house
or
they
have
long
ago
climbed
out
by
the
skylight
and
are
on
a
roof
half
a
block
away
then
the
thought
came
to
me
they
have
and
hold
the
entire
of
sackville
street
down
to
the
post
office
later
on
this
proved
to
be
the
case
and
i
knew
at
this
moment
that
sackville
street
was
doomed
i
continued
to
watch
the
bombardment
but
no
longer
with
the
anguish
which
had
before
torn
me
near
by
there
were
four
men
and
a
few
yards
away
clustered
in
a
laneway
there
were
a
dozen
others
an
agitated
girl
was
striding
from
the
farther
group
to
the
one
in
which
i
was
and
she
addressed
the
men
in
the
most
obscene
language
which
i
have
ever
heard
she
addressed
them
man
by
man
and
she
continued
to
speak
and
cry
and
scream
at
them
with
all
that
obstinate
angry
patience
of
which
only
a
woman
is
capable
she
cursed
us
all
she
called
down
diseases
on
every
human
being
in
the
world
excepting
only
the
men
who
were
being
bombarded
she
demanded
of
the
folk
in
the
laneway
that
they
should
march
at
least
into
the
roadway
and
prove
that
they
were
proud
men
and
were
not
afraid
of
bullets
she
had
been
herself
into
the
danger
zone
had
stood
herself
in
the
track
of
the
guns
and
had
there
cursed
her
fill
for
half
an
hour
and
she
desired
that
the
men
should
do
at
least
what
she
had
done
this
girl
was
quite
young
about
nineteen
years
of
age
and
was
dressed
in
the
customary
shawl
and
apron
of
her
class
her
face
was
rather
pretty
or
it
had
that
pretty
slenderness
and
softness
of
outline
which
belong
to
youth
but
every
sentence
she
spoke
contained
half
a
dozen
indecent
words
alas
it
was
only
that
her
vocabulary
was
not
equal
to
her
emotions
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
be
emphatic
without
being
obscene
it
is
the
cause
of
most
of
the
meaningless
swearing
one
hears
every
day
she
spoke
to
me
for
a
minute
and
her
eyes
were
as
soft
as
those
of
a
kitten
and
her
language
was
as
gentle
as
her
eyes
she
wanted
a
match
to
light
a
cigarette
but
i
had
none
and
said
that
i
also
wanted
one
in
a
few
minutes
she
brought
me
a
match
and
then
she
recommenced
her
tireless
weaving
of
six
vile
words
into
hundreds
of
stupid
sentences
about
five
the
guns
eased
off
of
kelly
to
inexperienced
eyes
they
did
not
seem
to
have
done
very
much
damage
but
afterwards
one
found
that
although
the
walls
were
standing
and
apparently
solid
there
was
no
inside
to
the
house
from
roof
to
basement
the
building
was
bare
as
a
dog
kennel
there
were
no
floors
inside
there
was
nothing
there
but
blank
space
and
on
the
ground
within
was
the
tumble
and
rubbish
that
had
been
roof
and
floors
and
furniture
everything
inside
was
smashed
and
pulverised
into
scrap
and
dust
and
the
only
objects
that
had
consistency
and
their
ancient
shape
were
the
bricks
that
fell
when
the
shells
struck
them
rifle
shots
had
begun
to
strike
the
house
on
the
further
side
of
the
street
a
jewellers
shop
called
hopkins
hopkins
the
impact
of
these
balls
on
the
bricks
was
louder
than
the
sound
of
the
shot
which
immediately
succeeded
and
each
bullet
that
struck
brought
down
a
shower
of
fine
red
dust
from
the
walls
perhaps
thirty
or
forty
shots
in
all
were
fired
at
hopkins
and
then
except
for
an
odd
crack
firing
ceased
during
all
this
time
there
had
been
no
reply
from
the
volunteers
and
i
thought
they
must
be
husbanding
their
ammunition
and
so
must
be
short
of
it
and
that
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
a
few
days
before
the
end
all
this
i
said
to
myself
will
be
finished
in
a
few
days
and
they
will
be
finished
life
here
will
recommence
exactly
where
it
left
off
and
except
for
some
graves
all
will
be
as
it
had
been
until
they
become
a
tradition
and
enter
the
imagination
of
their
race
i
spoke
to
several
of
the
people
about
me
and
found
the
same
willingness
to
exchange
news
that
i
had
found
elsewhere
in
the
city
and
the
same
reticences
as
regarded
their
private
opinions
two
of
them
indeed
and
they
were
the
only
two
i
met
with
during
the
insurrection
expressed
although
in
measured
terms
admiration
for
the
volunteers
and
while
they
did
not
side
with
them
they
did
not
say
anything
against
them
one
was
a
labouring
man
the
other
a
gentleman
the
remark
of
the
latter
was
i
am
an
irishman
and
pointing
to
the
shells
that
were
bursting
through
the
windows
in
front
of
us
i
hate
to
see
that
being
done
to
other
irishmen
he
had
come
from
some
part
of
the
country
to
spend
the
easter
holidays
in
dublin
and
was
unable
to
leave
town
again
the
labouring
man
he
was
about
years
of
age
spoke
very
quietly
and
collectedly
about
the
insurrection
he
was
a
type
with
whom
i
had
come
very
little
in
contact
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
simple
and
good
his
speech
was
and
how
calm
his
ideas
he
thought
labour
was
in
this
movement
to
a
greater
extent
than
was
imagined
i
mentioned
that
liberty
hall
had
been
blown
up
and
that
the
garrison
had
either
surrendered
or
been
killed
he
replied
that
a
gunboat
had
that
morning
come
up
the
river
and
had
blown
liberty
hall
into
smash
but
he
added
there
were
no
men
in
it
all
the
labour
volunteers
had
marched
with
connolly
into
the
post
office
he
said
the
labour
volunteers
might
possibly
number
about
one
thousand
men
but
that
it
would
be
quite
safe
to
say
eight
hundred
and
he
held
that
the
labour
volunteers
or
the
citizens
army
as
they
called
themselves
had
always
been
careful
not
to
reveal
their
numbers
they
had
always
announced
that
they
possessed
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
had
never
paraded
any
more
than
that
number
at
any
one
time
workingmen
he
continued
knew
that
the
men
who
marched
were
always
different
men
the
police
knew
it
too
but
they
thought
that
the
citizens
army
was
the
in
the
world
the
men
however
were
not
deserters
you
do
he
said
desert
a
man
like
connolly
and
they
were
merely
taking
their
turn
at
being
drilled
and
disciplined
they
were
raised
against
the
police
who
in
the
big
strike
of
two
years
ago
had
acted
towards
them
with
unparallelled
savagery
and
the
men
had
determined
that
the
police
would
never
again
find
them
thus
disorganised
this
man
believed
that
every
member
of
the
citizen
army
had
marched
with
their
leader
the
men
i
know
said
he
would
not
be
afraid
of
anything
and
he
continued
they
are
in
the
post
office
now
what
chance
have
they
none
he
replied
and
they
never
said
they
had
and
they
never
thought
they
would
have
any
how
long
do
you
think
they
be
able
to
hold
out
he
nodded
towards
the
house
that
had
been
bombarded
by
heavy
guns
that
will
root
them
out
of
it
quick
enough
was
his
reply
i
going
home
said
he
then
the
people
will
be
wondering
if
dead
or
alive
and
he
walked
away
from
that
sad
street
as
i
did
myself
a
few
minutes
afterwards
chapter
iv
thursday
again
the
rumours
greeted
one
this
place
had
fallen
and
had
not
fallen
such
a
position
had
been
captured
by
the
soldiers
recaptured
by
the
volunteers
and
had
not
been
attacked
at
all
but
certainly
fighting
was
proceeding
up
mount
street
the
rifle
volleys
were
continuous
and
the
coming
and
going
of
ambulance
cars
from
that
direction
were
continuous
also
some
spoke
of
pitched
battles
on
the
bridge
and
said
that
as
yet
the
advantage
lay
with
the
volunteers
at
there
came
the
sound
of
heavy
guns
firing
in
the
direction
of
sackville
street
i
went
on
the
roof
and
remained
there
for
some
time
from
this
height
the
sounds
could
be
heard
plainly
there
was
sustained
firing
along
the
whole
central
line
of
the
city
from
the
green
down
to
trinity
college
and
from
thence
to
sackville
street
and
the
report
of
the
various
types
of
arm
could
be
easily
distinguished
there
were
rifles
machine
guns
and
very
heavy
cannon
there
was
another
sound
which
i
could
not
put
a
name
to
something
that
coughed
out
over
all
the
other
sounds
a
short
sharp
bark
or
rather
a
short
noise
something
like
the
popping
of
a
tremendous
cork
i
met
his
chief
emotion
is
one
of
astonishment
at
the
organizing
powers
displayed
by
the
volunteers
we
have
exchanged
rumours
and
found
that
our
equipment
in
this
direction
is
almost
identical
he
says
sheehy
skeffington
has
been
killed
that
he
was
arrested
in
a
house
wherein
arms
were
found
and
was
shot
out
of
hand
i
hope
this
is
another
rumour
for
so
far
as
my
knowledge
of
him
goes
he
was
not
with
the
volunteers
and
it
is
said
that
he
was
antagonistic
to
the
forcible
methods
for
which
the
volunteers
stood
but
the
tale
of
his
death
is
so
persistent
that
one
is
inclined
to
believe
it
he
was
the
most
absurdly
courageous
man
i
have
ever
met
with
or
heard
of
he
has
been
in
every
trouble
that
has
touched
ireland
these
ten
years
back
and
he
has
always
been
in
on
the
generous
side
therefore
and
naturally
on
the
side
that
was
unpopular
and
weak
it
would
seem
indeed
that
a
cause
had
only
to
be
weak
to
gain
his
sympathy
and
his
sympathy
never
stayed
at
home
there
are
so
many
good
people
who
sympathise
with
this
or
that
cause
and
having
given
that
measure
of
their
emotion
they
give
no
more
of
it
or
of
anything
else
but
he
rushed
instantly
to
the
street
a
large
stone
the
lift
of
a
footpath
the
base
of
a
statue
any
place
and
every
place
was
for
him
a
pulpit
and
in
the
teeth
of
whatever
oppression
or
disaster
or
power
he
said
his
say
there
are
multitudes
of
men
in
dublin
of
all
classes
and
creeds
who
can
boast
that
they
kicked
sheehy
skeffington
or
that
they
struck
him
on
the
head
with
walking
sticks
and
umbrellas
or
that
they
smashed
their
fists
into
his
face
and
jumped
on
him
when
he
fell
it
is
by
no
means
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
these
things
were
done
to
him
and
it
is
true
that
he
bore
to
no
man
and
that
he
accepted
blows
and
indignities
and
ridicule
with
the
pathetic
candour
of
a
child
who
is
disguised
as
a
man
and
whose
disguise
can
not
come
off
his
tongue
his
pen
his
body
all
that
he
had
and
hoped
for
were
at
the
immediate
service
of
whoever
was
bewildered
or
oppressed
he
has
been
shot
other
men
have
been
shot
but
they
faced
the
guns
knowing
that
they
faced
justice
however
stern
and
oppressive
and
that
what
they
had
engaged
to
confront
was
before
them
he
had
no
such
thought
to
soothe
from
his
mind
anger
or
unforgiveness
he
who
was
a
pacifist
was
compelled
to
revolt
to
his
last
breath
and
on
the
instruments
of
his
end
he
must
have
looked
as
on
murderers
i
am
sure
that
to
the
end
he
railed
against
oppression
and
that
he
fell
marvelling
that
the
world
can
truly
be
as
it
is
with
his
death
there
passed
away
a
brave
man
and
a
clean
soul
later
on
this
day
i
met
sheehy
skeffington
in
the
street
she
confirmed
the
rumour
that
her
husband
had
been
arrested
on
the
previous
day
but
further
than
that
she
had
no
news
so
far
as
i
know
the
sole
crime
of
which
her
husband
had
been
guilty
was
that
he
called
for
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
to
enrol
special
constables
and
prevent
looting
among
the
rumours
it
was
stated
with
every
accent
of
certitude
that
madame
markievicz
had
been
captured
in
george
street
and
taken
to
the
castle
it
was
also
current
that
sir
roger
casement
had
been
captured
at
sea
and
had
already
been
shot
in
the
tower
of
london
the
names
of
several
volunteer
leaders
are
mentioned
as
being
dead
but
the
surmise
that
steals
timidly
from
one
mouth
flies
boldly
as
a
certitude
from
every
mouth
that
repeats
it
and
truth
itself
would
now
be
listened
to
with
only
a
gossip
ear
but
no
person
would
believe
a
word
of
it
this
night
also
was
calm
and
beautiful
but
this
night
was
the
most
sinister
and
woeful
of
those
that
have
passed
the
sound
of
artillery
of
rifles
machine
guns
grenades
did
not
cease
even
for
a
moment
from
my
window
i
saw
a
red
flare
that
crept
to
the
sky
and
stole
over
it
and
remained
there
glaring
the
smoke
reached
from
the
ground
to
the
clouds
and
i
could
see
great
red
sparks
go
soaring
to
enormous
heights
while
always
in
the
calm
air
hour
after
hour
there
was
the
buzzing
and
rattling
and
thudding
of
guns
and
but
for
the
guns
silence
it
is
in
a
dead
silence
this
insurrection
is
being
fought
and
one
imagines
what
must
be
the
feeling
of
these
men
young
for
the
most
part
and
unused
to
violence
who
are
submitting
silently
to
the
crash
and
flame
and
explosion
by
which
they
are
surrounded
chapter
friday
this
morning
there
are
no
newspapers
no
bread
no
milk
no
news
the
sun
is
shining
and
the
streets
are
lively
but
discreet
all
people
continue
to
talk
to
one
another
without
distinction
of
class
but
nobody
knows
what
any
person
thinks
it
is
a
little
singular
the
number
of
people
who
are
smiling
i
fancy
they
were
listening
to
the
guns
last
night
and
they
are
smiling
this
morning
because
the
darkness
is
past
and
because
the
sun
is
shining
and
because
they
can
move
their
limbs
in
space
and
may
talk
without
having
to
sink
their
voices
to
a
whisper
guns
do
not
sound
so
bad
in
the
day
as
they
do
at
night
and
no
person
can
feel
lonely
while
the
sun
shines
the
men
are
smiling
but
the
women
laugh
and
their
laughter
does
not
displease
for
whatever
women
do
in
whatever
circumstances
appears
to
have
a
rightness
of
its
own
it
seems
right
that
they
should
scream
when
danger
to
themselves
is
imminent
and
it
seems
right
that
they
should
laugh
when
the
danger
only
threatens
others
it
is
rumoured
this
morning
that
sackville
street
has
been
burned
out
and
levelled
to
the
ground
it
is
said
that
the
end
is
in
sight
and
it
is
said
that
matters
are
if
anything
rather
worse
than
better
that
the
volunteers
have
sallied
from
some
of
their
strongholds
and
entrenched
themselves
and
that
in
one
place
alone
the
south
lotts
they
have
seven
machine
guns
that
when
the
houses
which
they
held
became
untenable
they
rushed
out
and
seized
other
houses
and
that
pursuing
these
tactics
there
seemed
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
insurrection
would
ever
come
to
an
end
that
the
streets
are
filled
with
volunteers
in
plain
clothes
but
having
revolvers
in
their
pockets
that
the
streets
are
filled
with
soldiers
equally
revolvered
and
plain
clothed
and
that
the
least
one
says
on
any
subject
the
less
one
would
have
to
answer
for
the
feeling
that
i
tapped
was
definitely
but
the
number
of
people
who
would
speak
was
few
and
one
regarded
the
noncommital
folk
who
were
so
smiling
and
polite
and
so
prepared
to
talk
with
much
curiosity
seeking
to
read
in
their
eyes
in
their
bearing
even
in
the
cut
of
their
clothes
what
might
be
the
secret
movements
and
cogitations
of
their
minds
i
received
the
impression
that
numbers
of
them
did
not
care
a
rap
what
way
it
went
and
that
others
had
ceased
to
be
mental
creatures
and
were
merely
machines
for
registering
the
sensations
of
the
time
none
of
these
people
were
prepared
for
insurrection
the
thing
had
been
sprung
on
them
so
suddenly
that
they
were
unable
to
take
sides
and
their
feeling
of
detachment
was
still
so
complete
that
they
would
have
betted
on
the
business
as
if
it
had
been
a
horse
race
or
a
dog
fight
many
english
troops
have
been
landed
each
night
and
it
is
believed
that
there
are
more
than
sixty
thousand
soldiers
in
dublin
alone
and
that
they
are
supplied
with
every
offensive
contrivance
which
military
art
has
invented
merrion
square
is
strongly
held
by
the
soldiers
they
are
posted
along
both
sides
of
the
road
at
intervals
of
about
twenty
paces
and
their
guns
are
continually
barking
up
at
the
roofs
which
surround
them
in
the
great
square
it
is
said
that
these
roofs
are
held
by
the
volunteers
from
mount
street
bridge
to
the
square
and
that
they
hold
in
like
manner
wide
stretches
of
the
city
they
appear
to
have
mapped
out
the
roofs
with
all
the
thoroughness
that
had
hitherto
been
expended
on
the
roads
and
upon
these
roofs
they
are
so
mobile
and
crafty
and
so
much
at
home
that
the
work
of
the
soldiers
will
be
exceedingly
difficult
as
well
as
dangerous
still
and
notwithstanding
men
can
only
take
to
the
roofs
for
a
short
time
up
there
there
can
be
no
means
of
transport
and
their
ammunition
as
well
as
their
food
will
very
soon
be
used
up
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
the
fact
that
they
have
to
take
to
the
roofs
even
though
that
be
in
their
programme
means
that
they
are
finished
from
the
roof
there
comes
the
sound
of
machine
guns
looking
towards
sackville
street
one
picks
out
easily
nelson
pillar
which
towers
slenderly
over
all
the
buildings
of
the
neighbourhood
it
is
wreathed
in
smoke
another
towering
building
was
the
café
its
pagoda
was
a
landmark
easily
to
be
found
but
i
could
not
find
it
it
was
not
there
and
i
knew
that
even
if
all
sackville
street
was
not
burned
down
as
rumour
insisted
this
great
café
had
certainly
been
curtailed
by
its
roof
and
might
perhaps
have
been
completely
burned
on
the
gravel
paths
i
found
pieces
of
charred
and
burnt
paper
these
scraps
must
have
been
blown
remarkably
high
to
have
crossed
all
the
roofs
that
lie
between
sackville
street
and
merrion
square
at
eleven
there
is
continuous
firing
and
snipers
firing
from
the
direction
of
mount
street
and
in
every
direction
of
the
city
these
sounds
are
being
duplicated
in
camden
street
the
sniping
and
casualties
are
said
to
have
been
very
heavy
one
man
saw
two
volunteers
taken
from
a
house
by
the
soldiers
they
were
placed
kneeling
in
the
centre
of
the
road
and
within
one
minute
of
their
capture
they
were
dead
simultaneously
there
fell
several
of
the
firing
party
an
officer
in
this
part
had
his
brains
blown
into
the
roadway
a
young
girl
ran
into
the
road
picked
up
his
cap
and
scraped
the
brains
into
it
she
covered
this
poor
debris
with
a
little
straw
and
carried
the
hat
piously
to
the
nearest
hospital
in
order
that
the
brains
might
be
buried
with
their
owner
the
continuation
of
her
story
was
less
gloomy
although
it
affected
the
teller
equally
there
is
not
said
she
a
cat
or
a
dog
left
alive
in
camden
street
they
are
lying
stiff
out
in
the
road
and
up
on
the
roofs
there
lots
of
women
will
be
sorry
for
this
war
said
she
and
their
pets
killed
on
them
in
many
parts
of
the
city
hunger
began
to
be
troublesome
a
girl
told
me
that
her
family
and
another
that
had
taken
refuge
with
them
had
eaten
nothing
for
three
days
on
this
day
her
father
managed
to
get
two
loaves
of
bread
somewhere
and
he
brought
these
home
when
said
the
girl
my
father
came
in
with
the
bread
the
whole
fourteen
of
us
ran
at
him
and
in
a
minute
we
were
all
ashamed
for
the
loaves
were
gone
to
the
last
crumb
and
we
were
all
as
hungry
as
we
had
been
before
he
came
in
the
poor
man
said
she
did
not
even
get
a
bit
for
himself
she
held
that
the
poor
people
were
against
the
volunteers
the
volunteers
still
hold
jacob
biscuit
factory
it
is
rumoured
that
a
priest
visited
them
and
counselled
surrender
and
they
replied
that
they
did
not
go
there
to
surrender
but
to
be
killed
they
asked
him
to
give
them
absolution
and
the
story
continues
that
he
refused
to
do
so
but
this
is
not
in
its
latter
part
a
story
that
can
easily
be
credited
the
adelaide
hospital
is
close
to
this
factory
and
it
is
possible
that
the
proximity
of
the
hospital
delays
or
hinders
military
operations
against
the
factory
rifle
volleys
are
continuous
about
merrion
square
and
prolonged
machine
gun
firing
can
be
heard
also
during
the
night
the
firing
was
heavy
from
almost
every
direction
and
in
the
direction
of
sackville
street
a
red
glare
told
again
of
fire
it
is
hard
to
get
to
bed
these
nights
it
is
hard
even
to
sit
down
for
the
moment
one
does
sit
down
one
stands
immediately
up
again
resuming
that
ridiculous
ship
march
from
the
window
to
the
wall
and
back
i
am
foot
weary
as
i
have
never
been
before
in
my
life
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
excited
no
person
in
dublin
is
excited
but
there
exists
a
state
of
tension
and
expectancy
which
is
mentally
more
exasperating
than
any
excitement
could
be
the
absence
of
news
is
largely
responsible
for
this
we
do
not
know
what
has
happened
what
is
happening
or
what
is
going
to
happen
and
the
reversion
to
barbarism
for
barbarism
is
largely
a
lack
of
news
disturbs
us
each
night
we
have
got
to
bed
at
last
murmuring
i
wonder
will
it
be
all
over
and
this
night
the
like
question
accompanied
us
chapter
vi
saturday
this
morning
also
there
has
been
no
bread
no
milk
no
meat
no
newspapers
but
the
sun
is
shining
it
is
astonishing
that
thus
early
in
the
spring
the
weather
should
be
so
beautiful
it
is
stated
freely
that
the
post
office
has
been
taken
and
just
as
freely
it
is
averred
that
it
has
not
been
taken
the
approaches
to
merrion
square
are
held
by
the
military
and
i
was
not
permitted
to
go
to
my
office
as
i
came
to
this
point
shots
were
fired
at
a
motor
car
which
had
not
stopped
on
being
challenged
bystanders
said
it
was
sir
horace
plunkett
car
and
that
he
had
been
shot
later
we
found
that
sir
horace
was
not
hurt
but
that
his
nephew
who
drove
the
car
had
been
severely
wounded
at
this
hour
the
rumour
of
the
fall
of
verdun
was
persistent
later
on
it
was
denied
as
was
denied
the
companion
rumour
of
the
relief
of
kut
saw
who
had
spent
three
days
and
the
whole
of
his
money
in
getting
home
from
county
clare
he
had
heard
that
sheehy
house
was
raided
and
that
two
dead
bodies
had
been
taken
out
of
it
saw
miss
who
seemed
sad
i
do
not
know
what
her
politics
are
but
i
think
that
the
word
kindness
might
be
used
to
cover
all
her
activities
she
has
a
heart
of
gold
and
the
courage
of
many
lions
i
then
met
commissioner
bailey
who
said
the
volunteers
had
sent
a
deputation
and
that
terms
of
surrender
were
being
discussed
i
hope
this
is
true
and
i
hope
mercy
will
be
shown
to
the
men
nobody
believes
there
will
be
any
mercy
shown
and
it
is
freely
reported
that
they
are
shot
in
the
street
or
are
taken
to
the
nearest
barracks
and
shot
there
the
belief
grows
that
no
person
who
is
now
in
the
insurrection
will
be
alive
when
the
insurrection
is
ended
that
is
as
it
will
be
but
these
days
the
thought
of
death
does
not
strike
on
the
mind
with
any
severity
and
should
the
european
war
continue
much
longer
the
fear
of
death
will
entirely
depart
from
man
as
it
has
departed
many
times
in
history
with
that
great
deterrent
gone
our
rulers
will
be
gravely
at
a
loss
in
dealing
with
strikers
and
other
such
discontented
people
possibly
they
will
have
to
resurrect
the
idea
of
torture
the
people
in
the
streets
are
laughing
and
chatting
indeed
there
is
gaiety
in
the
air
as
well
as
sunshine
and
no
person
seems
to
care
that
men
are
being
shot
every
other
minute
or
bayoneted
or
blown
into
scraps
or
burned
into
cinders
these
things
are
happening
nevertheless
but
much
of
their
importance
has
vanished
i
met
a
man
at
the
green
who
was
drawing
a
plan
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
the
problem
was
how
his
questioner
was
to
get
from
where
he
was
standing
to
a
street
lying
at
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
the
plan
as
drawn
insisted
that
to
cover
this
quarter
of
an
hour
distance
he
must
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
of
more
than
twenty
miles
another
young
boy
was
standing
near
embracing
a
large
ham
he
had
been
trying
for
three
days
to
convey
his
ham
to
a
house
near
the
gresham
hotel
where
his
sister
lived
he
had
almost
given
up
hope
and
he
hearkened
intelligently
to
the
idea
that
he
should
himself
eat
the
ham
and
so
get
rid
of
it
the
rifle
fire
was
persistent
all
day
but
saving
in
certain
localities
it
was
not
heavy
occasionally
the
machine
guns
rapped
in
there
was
no
sound
of
heavy
artillery
the
rumour
grows
that
the
post
office
has
been
evacuated
and
that
the
volunteers
are
at
large
and
spreading
everywhere
across
the
roofs
the
rumour
grows
also
that
terms
of
surrender
are
being
discussed
and
that
sackville
street
has
been
levelled
to
the
ground
at
seven
in
the
evening
calm
is
almost
complete
the
sound
of
a
rifle
shot
being
only
heard
at
long
intervals
i
got
to
bed
this
night
earlier
than
usual
at
two
i
left
the
window
from
which
a
red
flare
is
yet
visible
in
the
direction
of
sackville
street
the
morning
will
tell
if
the
insurrection
is
finished
or
not
but
at
this
hour
all
is
not
over
shots
are
ringing
all
around
and
down
my
street
and
the
vicious
crackling
of
these
rifles
grow
at
times
into
regular
volleys
chapter
vii
sunday
the
insurrection
has
not
ceased
there
is
much
rifle
fire
but
no
sound
from
the
machine
guns
or
the
eighteen
pounders
and
trench
mortars
from
the
window
of
my
kitchen
the
flag
of
the
republic
can
be
seen
flying
afar
this
is
the
flag
that
flies
over
jacob
biscuit
factory
and
i
will
know
that
the
insurrection
has
ended
as
soon
as
i
see
this
flag
pulled
down
when
i
went
out
there
were
few
people
in
the
streets
i
met
and
together
we
passed
up
the
green
the
republican
flag
was
still
flying
over
the
college
of
surgeons
we
tried
to
get
down
grafton
street
where
broken
windows
and
two
gaping
interiors
told
of
the
recent
visit
of
looters
but
a
little
down
this
street
we
were
waved
back
by
armed
sentries
we
then
cut
away
by
the
gaiety
theatre
into
mercer
street
where
immense
lines
of
poor
people
were
drawn
up
waiting
for
the
opening
of
the
local
bakery
we
got
into
george
street
thinking
to
turn
down
dame
street
and
get
from
thence
near
enough
to
sackville
street
to
see
if
the
rumours
about
its
destruction
were
true
but
here
also
we
were
halted
by
the
military
and
had
to
retrace
our
steps
there
was
no
news
of
any
kind
to
be
gathered
from
the
people
we
talked
to
nor
had
they
even
any
rumours
this
was
the
first
day
i
had
been
able
to
get
even
a
short
distance
outside
of
my
own
quarter
and
it
seemed
that
the
people
of
my
quarter
were
more
able
in
the
manufacture
of
news
or
more
imaginative
than
were
the
people
who
live
in
other
parts
of
the
city
we
had
no
sooner
struck
into
home
parts
than
we
found
news
we
were
told
that
two
of
the
volunteer
leaders
had
been
shot
these
were
pearse
and
connolly
the
latter
was
reported
as
lying
in
the
castle
hospital
with
a
fractured
thigh
pearse
was
cited
as
dead
with
two
hundred
of
his
men
following
their
sally
from
the
post
office
the
machine
guns
had
caught
them
as
they
left
and
none
of
them
remained
alive
the
news
seemed
afterwards
to
be
true
except
that
instead
of
pearse
it
was
the
who
had
been
killed
pearse
died
later
and
with
less
excitement
a
man
who
had
seen
an
english
newspaper
said
that
the
kut
force
had
surrendered
to
the
turk
but
that
verdun
had
not
fallen
to
the
germans
the
rumour
was
current
also
that
a
great
naval
battle
had
been
fought
whereat
the
german
fleet
had
been
totally
destroyed
with
loss
to
the
english
of
eighteen
warships
it
was
said
that
among
the
captured
volunteers
there
had
been
a
large
body
of
germans
but
nobody
believed
it
and
this
rumour
was
inevitably
followed
by
the
tale
that
there
were
one
hundred
german
submarines
lying
in
the
stephen
green
pond
at
two
i
met
commissioner
bailey
who
told
me
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
the
volunteers
were
surrendering
everywhere
in
the
city
a
motor
car
with
two
military
officers
and
two
volunteer
leaders
had
driven
to
the
college
of
surgeons
and
been
admitted
after
a
short
interval
madame
marckievicz
marched
out
of
the
college
at
the
head
of
about
men
and
they
had
given
up
their
arms
the
motor
car
with
the
volunteer
leaders
was
driving
to
other
strongholds
and
it
was
expected
that
before
nightfall
the
capitulations
would
be
complete
i
started
home
and
on
the
way
i
met
a
man
whom
i
had
encountered
some
days
previously
and
from
whom
rumours
had
sprung
as
though
he
wove
them
from
his
entrails
as
a
spider
weaves
his
web
he
was
no
less
provided
on
this
occasion
and
it
was
curious
to
listen
to
his
tale
of
english
defeats
on
every
front
he
announced
the
invasion
of
england
in
six
different
quarters
the
total
destruction
of
the
english
fleet
and
the
landing
of
immense
german
armies
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
he
made
these
things
up
in
his
head
then
he
repeated
them
to
himself
in
a
loud
voice
and
became
somehow
persuaded
that
they
had
been
told
to
him
by
a
stranger
and
then
he
believed
them
and
told
them
to
everybody
he
met
amongst
other
things
spain
had
declared
war
on
our
behalf
the
chilian
navy
was
hastening
to
our
relief
for
a
pin
he
would
have
sent
france
flying
westward
all
forgetful
of
her
own
war
a
singular
man
truly
and
as
i
do
think
the
only
thoroughly
happy
person
in
our
city
it
is
three
and
from
my
window
the
republican
flag
can
still
be
seen
flying
over
jacob
factory
there
is
occasional
shooting
but
the
city
as
a
whole
is
quiet
at
a
quarter
to
five
a
heavy
gun
boomed
once
ten
minutes
later
there
was
heavy
machine
gun
firing
and
much
rifle
shooting
in
another
ten
minutes
the
flag
at
jacob
was
hauled
down
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
sniping
and
military
replies
were
incessant
particularly
in
my
street
the
raids
have
begun
in
private
houses
count
plunkett
house
was
entered
by
the
military
who
remained
there
for
a
very
long
time
passing
home
about
two
minutes
after
proclamation
hour
i
was
pursued
for
the
whole
of
fitzwilliam
square
by
bullets
they
buzzed
into
the
roadway
beside
me
and
the
sound
as
they
whistled
near
was
curious
the
sound
is
something
like
that
made
by
a
very
swift
saw
and
one
gets
the
impression
that
as
well
as
being
very
swift
they
are
very
heavy
snipers
are
undoubtedly
on
the
roofs
opposite
my
house
and
they
are
not
asleep
on
these
roofs
possibly
it
is
difficult
to
communicate
with
these
isolated
bands
the
news
of
their
companions
surrender
but
it
is
likely
they
will
learn
by
the
diminution
of
fire
in
other
quarters
that
their
work
is
over
in
the
morning
on
looking
from
my
window
i
saw
four
policemen
marching
into
the
street
they
were
the
first
i
had
seen
for
a
week
soon
now
the
military
tale
will
finish
the
police
story
will
commence
the
political
story
will
recommence
and
perhaps
the
weeks
that
follow
this
one
will
sow
the
seed
of
more
hatred
than
so
many
centuries
will
be
able
to
uproot
again
for
although
irish
people
do
not
greatly
fear
the
military
they
fear
the
police
and
they
have
very
good
reason
to
do
so
chapter
viii
the
insurrection
is
over
the
insurrection
is
over
and
it
is
worth
asking
what
has
happened
how
it
has
happened
and
why
it
happened
the
first
question
is
easily
answered
the
finest
part
of
our
city
has
been
blown
to
smithereens
and
burned
into
ashes
soldiers
amongst
us
who
have
served
abroad
say
that
the
ruin
of
this
quarter
is
more
complete
than
any
thing
they
have
seen
at
ypres
than
anything
they
have
seen
anywhere
in
france
or
flanders
a
great
number
of
our
men
and
women
and
children
volunteers
and
civilians
confounded
alike
are
dead
and
some
fifty
thousand
men
who
have
been
moved
with
military
equipment
to
our
land
are
now
being
removed
therefrom
the
english
nation
has
been
disorganised
no
more
than
as
they
were
affected
by
the
transport
of
these
men
and
material
that
is
what
happened
and
it
is
all
that
happened
how
it
happened
is
another
matter
and
one
which
perhaps
will
not
be
made
clear
for
years
all
we
know
in
dublin
is
that
our
city
burst
into
a
kind
of
spontaneous
war
that
we
lived
through
it
during
one
singular
week
and
that
it
faded
away
and
disappeared
almost
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
the
men
who
knew
about
it
are
with
two
exceptions
dead
and
these
two
exceptions
are
in
gaol
and
likely
to
remain
there
long
enough
since
writing
one
of
these
men
has
been
shot
why
it
happened
is
a
question
that
may
be
answered
more
particularly
it
happened
because
the
leader
of
the
irish
party
misrepresented
his
people
in
the
english
house
of
parliament
on
the
day
of
the
declaration
of
war
between
england
and
germany
he
took
the
irish
case
weighty
with
eight
centuries
of
history
and
tradition
and
he
threw
it
out
of
the
window
he
pledged
ireland
to
a
particular
course
of
action
and
he
had
no
authority
to
give
this
pledge
and
he
had
no
guarantee
that
it
would
be
met
the
ramshackle
intelligence
of
his
party
and
his
own
emotional
nature
betrayed
him
and
us
and
england
he
swore
ireland
to
loyalty
as
if
he
had
ireland
in
his
pocket
and
could
answer
for
her
ireland
has
never
been
disloyal
to
england
not
even
at
this
epoch
because
she
has
never
been
loyal
to
england
and
the
profession
of
her
national
faith
has
been
unwavering
has
been
known
to
every
english
person
alive
and
has
been
clamant
to
all
the
world
beside
is
it
that
he
wanted
to
be
cheered
he
could
very
easily
have
stated
ireland
case
truthfully
and
have
proclaimed
a
benevolent
neutrality
if
he
cared
to
use
the
grandiloquent
words
on
the
part
of
this
country
he
would
have
gotten
his
cheers
he
would
in
a
few
months
have
gotten
home
rule
in
return
for
irish
soldiers
he
would
have
received
politically
whatever
england
could
have
safely
given
him
but
alas
these
carefulnesses
did
not
chime
with
his
emotional
moment
they
were
not
magnificent
enough
for
one
who
felt
that
he
was
talking
not
to
ireland
or
to
england
but
to
the
whole
gaping
and
eager
earth
and
so
he
pledged
his
country
credit
so
deeply
that
he
did
not
leave
her
even
one
national
rag
to
cover
herself
with
after
a
lie
truth
bursts
out
and
it
is
no
longer
the
radiant
and
serene
goddess
knew
or
hoped
for
it
is
a
disease
it
is
a
moral
syphilis
and
will
ravage
until
the
body
in
which
it
can
dwell
has
been
purged
redmond
told
the
lie
and
he
is
answerable
to
england
for
the
violence
she
had
to
be
guilty
of
and
to
ireland
for
the
desolation
to
which
we
have
had
to
submit
without
his
lie
there
had
been
no
insurrection
without
it
there
had
been
at
this
moment
and
for
a
year
past
an
end
to
the
irish
question
ireland
must
in
ages
gone
have
been
guilty
of
abominable
crimes
or
she
could
not
at
this
juncture
have
been
afflicted
with
a
john
redmond
he
is
the
immediate
cause
of
this
our
latest
insurrection
the
word
is
big
much
too
big
for
the
deed
and
we
should
call
it
row
or
riot
or
squabble
in
order
to
draw
the
fact
down
to
its
dimensions
but
the
ultimate
blame
for
the
trouble
between
the
two
countries
does
not
fall
against
ireland
the
fault
lies
with
england
and
in
these
days
while
an
effort
is
being
made
interrupted
it
is
true
by
cannon
to
found
a
better
understanding
between
the
two
nations
it
is
well
that
england
should
recognize
what
she
has
done
to
ireland
and
should
try
at
least
to
atone
for
it
the
situation
can
be
explained
almost
in
a
phrase
we
are
a
little
country
and
you
a
huge
country
have
persistently
beaten
us
we
are
a
poor
country
and
you
the
richest
country
in
the
world
have
persistently
robbed
us
that
is
the
historical
fact
and
whatever
national
or
political
necessities
are
opposed
in
reply
it
is
true
that
you
have
never
given
ireland
any
reason
to
love
you
and
you
can
not
claim
her
affection
without
hypocrisy
or
stupidity
you
think
our
people
can
only
be
tenacious
in
hate
it
is
a
lie
our
historical
memory
is
truly
tenacious
but
during
the
long
and
miserable
tale
of
our
relations
you
have
never
given
us
one
generosity
to
remember
you
by
and
you
must
not
claim
our
affection
or
our
devotion
until
you
are
worthy
of
them
we
are
a
good
people
almost
we
are
the
only
christian
people
left
in
the
world
nor
has
any
nation
shown
such
forbearance
towards
their
persecutor
as
we
have
always
shown
to
you
no
nation
has
forgiven
its
enemies
as
we
have
forgiven
you
time
after
time
down
the
miserable
generations
the
continuity
of
forgiveness
only
equalled
by
the
continuity
of
your
between
our
two
countries
you
have
kept
and
protected
a
screen
of
traders
and
politicians
who
are
just
as
truly
your
enemies
as
they
are
ours
in
the
end
they
will
do
most
harm
to
you
for
we
are
by
this
vaccinated
against
misery
but
you
are
not
and
the
loyalists
who
sell
their
own
country
for
a
shilling
will
sell
another
country
for
a
penny
when
the
opportunity
comes
and
safety
with
it
meanwhile
do
not
always
hasten
your
presents
to
us
out
of
a
gun
you
have
done
it
so
often
that
your
guns
begin
to
bore
us
and
you
have
now
an
opportunity
which
may
never
occur
again
to
make
us
your
friends
there
is
no
bitterness
in
ireland
against
you
on
account
of
this
war
and
the
lack
of
amongst
us
is
entirely
due
to
the
more
than
admirable
behaviour
of
the
soldiers
whom
you
sent
over
here
a
peace
that
will
last
for
ever
can
be
made
with
ireland
if
you
wish
to
make
it
but
you
must
take
her
hand
at
once
for
in
a
few
months
time
she
will
not
open
it
to
you
the
old
bad
relations
will
the
rancor
will
be
born
and
grow
and
another
memory
will
be
stored
away
in
ireland
capacious

chapter
ix
the
volunteers
there
is
much
talk
of
the
extraordinary
organising
powers
displayed
in
the
insurrection
but
in
truth
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
the
real
essence
and
singularity
of
the
rising
exists
in
its
simplicity
and
saving
for
the
courage
which
carried
it
out
the
word
extraordinary
is
misplaced
in
this
context
the
tactics
of
the
volunteers
as
they
began
to
emerge
were
reduced
to
the
very
skeleton
of
strategy
it
was
only
that
they
seized
certain
central
and
stragetical
districts
garrisoned
those
and
held
them
until
they
were
put
out
of
them
once
in
their
forts
there
was
no
further
egress
by
the
doors
and
for
purpose
of
entry
and
sortie
they
used
the
skylights
and
the
roofs
on
the
roofs
they
had
plenty
of
cover
and
this
cover
conferred
on
them
a
mobility
which
was
their
chief
asset
and
which
alone
enabled
them
to
protract
the
rebellion
beyond
the
first
day
this
was
the
entire
of
their
home
plan
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
had
studied
dublin
roofs
and
means
of
by
roofs
with
the
closest
care
further
than
that
i
do
not
think
they
had
organised
anything
but
this
was
only
the
primary
plan
and
unless
they
were
entirely
mad
there
must
have
been
a
sequel
to
it
which
did
not
materialise
and
which
would
have
materialised
but
that
the
english
fleet
blocked
the
way
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
expected
the
country
to
rise
with
them
and
they
must
have
known
what
their
own
numbers
were
and
what
chance
they
had
of
making
a
protracted
resistance
the
word
resistance
is
the
keyword
of
the
rising
and
the
plan
of
holding
out
must
have
been
rounded
off
with
a
date
at
that
date
something
else
was
to
have
happened
which
would
relieve
them
there
is
not
much
else
that
could
happen
except
the
landing
of
german
troops
in
ireland
or
in
england
it
would
have
been
i
think
immaterial
to
them
where
these
were
landed
but
the
reasoning
seems
to
point
to
the
fact
that
they
expected
and
had
arranged
for
such
a
landing
although
on
this
point
there
is
as
yet
no
evidence
the
logic
of
this
is
so
simple
so
plausible
that
it
might
be
accepted
without
further
examination
and
yet
further
examination
is
necessary
for
in
a
country
like
ireland
logic
and
plausibility
are
more
often
wrong
than
right
it
may
just
as
easily
be
that
except
for
furnishing
some
arms
and
ammunition
germany
was
not
in
the
rising
at
all
and
this
i
prefer
to
believe
it
had
been
current
long
before
the
rising
that
the
volunteers
knew
they
could
not
seriously
embarass
england
and
that
their
sole
aim
was
to
make
such
a
row
in
ireland
that
the
irish
question
would
take
the
status
of
an
international
one
and
on
the
discussion
of
terms
of
peace
in
the
european
war
the
claims
of
ireland
would
have
to
be
considered
by
the
whole
council
of
europe
and
the
world
that
is
in
my
opinion
the
metaphysic
behind
the
rising
it
is
quite
likely
that
they
hoped
for
german
aid
possibly
some
thousands
of
men
who
would
enable
them
to
prolong
the
row
but
i
do
not
believe
they
expected
german
armies
nor
do
i
think
they
would
have
welcomed
these
with
any
cordiality
in
this
insurrection
there
are
two
things
which
are
singular
in
the
history
of
irish
risings
one
is
that
there
were
no
informers
or
there
were
no
informers
among
the
chiefs
i
did
hear
people
say
in
the
streets
that
two
days
before
the
rising
they
knew
it
was
to
come
they
invariably
added
that
they
had
not
believed
the
news
and
had
laughed
at
it
a
priest
said
the
same
thing
in
my
hearing
and
it
may
be
that
the
rumour
was
widely
spread
and
that
everybody
including
the
authorities
looked
upon
it
as
a
joke
the
other
singularity
of
the
rising
is
the
amazing
silence
in
which
it
was
fought
nothing
spoke
but
the
guns
and
the
volunteers
on
the
one
side
and
the
soldiers
on
the
other
potted
each
other
and
died
in
whispers
it
might
have
been
said
that
both
sides
feared
the
germans
would
hear
them
and
take
advantage
of
their
preoccupation
there
is
a
third
reason
given
for
the
rebellion
and
it
also
is
divorced
from
foreign
plots
it
is
said
and
the
belief
in
dublin
was
widespread
that
the
government
intended
to
raid
the
volunteers
and
seize
their
arms
one
remembers
the
paper
which
alderman
kelly
read
to
the
dublin
corporation
and
which
purported
to
be
state
instructions
that
the
military
and
police
should
raid
the
volunteers
and
seize
their
arms
and
leaders
the
volunteers
had
sworn
they
would
not
permit
their
arms
to
be
taken
from
them
a
list
of
the
places
to
be
raided
was
given
and
the
news
created
something
of
a
sensation
in
ireland
when
it
was
published
that
evening
the
press
by
instruction
apparently
repudiated
this
document
but
the
volunteers
with
most
of
the
public
believed
it
to
be
true
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
rebellion
took
place
in
order
to
forestall
the
government
this
is
also
an
explanation
of
the
rebellion
and
is
just
as
good
a
one
as
any
other
it
is
the
explanation
which
i
believe
to
be
the
true
one
all
the
talk
of
german
invasion
and
the
landing
of
german
troops
in
ireland
is
so
much
nonsense
in
view
of
the
fact
that
england
is
master
of
the
seas
and
that
from
a
week
before
the
war
down
to
this
date
she
has
been
the
undisputed
monarch
of
those
ridges
during
this
war
there
will
be
no
landing
of
troops
in
either
england
or
ireland
unless
germany
in
the
meantime
can
solve
the
problem
of
submarine
transport
it
is
a
problem
which
will
be
solved
some
day
for
every
problem
can
be
solved
but
it
will
hardly
be
during
the
progress
of
this
war
the
men
at
the
head
of
the
volunteers
were
not
geniuses
neither
were
they
fools
and
the
difficulty
of
acquiring
military
aid
from
germany
must
have
seemed
as
insurmountable
to
them
as
it
does
to
the
germans
themselves
they
rose
because
they
felt
that
they
had
to
do
so
or
be
driven
like
sheep
into
the
nearest
police
barracks
and
be
laughed
at
by
the
whole
of
ireland
as
cowards
and
braggarts
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
why
on
the
eve
of
the
insurrection
professor
macneill
resigned
the
presidency
of
the
volunteers
the
story
of
treachery
which
was
heard
in
the
streets
is
not
the
true
one
for
men
of
his
type
are
not
traitors
and
this
statement
may
be
dismissed
without
further
comment
or
notice
one
is
left
to
imagine
what
can
have
happened
during
the
conference
which
is
said
to
have
preceded
the
rising
and
which
ended
with
the
resignation
of
professor
macneill
this
is
my
view
or
my
imagining
of
what
occurred
the
conference
was
called
because
the
various
leaders
felt
that
a
hostile
movement
was
projected
by
the
government
and
that
the
times
were
exceedingly
black
for
them
neither
birrell
nor
sir
mathew
nathan
had
any
desire
that
there
should
be
a
conflict
in
ireland
during
the
war
this
can
not
be
doubted
from
such
a
conflict
there
might
follow
all
kinds
of
political
repercussions
but
although
the
government
favoured
the
policy
of
there
was
a
powerful
military
and
political
party
in
ireland
whose
whole
effort
was
towards
the
disarming
and
punishment
of
the
volunteers
particularly
i
should
say
the
punishment
of
the
volunteers
i
believe
or
rather
i
imagine
that
professor
macneill
was
approached
at
the
instance
of
birrell
or
sir
mathew
nathan
and
assured
that
the
government
did
not
meditate
any
move
against
his
men
and
that
so
long
as
his
volunteers
remained
quiet
they
would
not
be
molested
by
the
authorities
i
would
say
that
professor
macneill
gave
and
accepted
the
necessary
assurances
and
that
when
he
informed
his
conference
of
what
had
occurred
and
found
that
they
did
not
believe
faith
would
be
kept
with
them
he
resigned
in
the
dispairing
hope
that
his
action
might
turn
them
from
a
purpose
which
he
considered
lunatic
or
at
least
by
restraining
a
number
of
his
followers
from
rising
he
might
limit
the
tale
of
men
who
would
be
uselessly
killed
he
was
not
alone
in
his
vote
against
a
rising
the
and
some
others
are
reputed
to
have
voted
with
him
but
when
insurrection
was
decided
on
the
marched
with
his
men
and
surely
a
gallant
man
could
not
have
done
otherwise
when
the
story
of
what
occurred
is
authoritatively
written
it
may
be
written
i
think
that
this
will
be
found
to
be
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
that
german
intrigue
and
german
money
counted
for
so
little
in
the
insurrection
as
to
be
negligible
chapter
x
some
of
the
leaders
meanwhile
the
insurrection
like
all
its
historical
forerunners
has
been
quelled
in
blood
it
sounds
rhetorical
to
say
so
but
it
was
not
quelled
in
peasoup
or
tisane
while
it
lasted
the
fighting
was
very
determined
and
it
is
easily
i
think
the
most
considerable
of
irish
rebellions
the
country
was
not
with
it
for
be
it
remembered
that
a
whole
army
of
irishmen
possibly
three
hundred
thousand
of
our
race
are
fighting
with
england
instead
of
against
her
in
dublin
alone
there
is
scarcely
a
poor
home
in
which
a
father
a
brother
or
a
son
is
not
serving
in
one
of
the
many
fronts
which
england
is
defending
had
the
country
risen
and
fought
as
stubbornly
as
the
volunteers
did
no
troops
could
have
beaten
them
well
that
is
a
wild
statement
the
heavy
guns
could
always
beat
them
but
from
whatever
angle
irish
people
consider
this
affair
it
must
appear
to
them
tragic
and
lamentable
beyond
expression
but
not
mean
and
not
unheroic
it
was
hard
enough
that
our
men
in
the
english
armies
should
be
slain
for
causes
which
no
amount
of
explanation
will
ever
render
less
foreign
to
us
or
even
intelligible
but
that
our
men
who
were
left
should
be
killed
in
ireland
fighting
against
the
same
england
that
their
brothers
are
fighting
for
ties
the
question
into
such
knots
of
contradiction
as
we
may
give
up
trying
to
unravel
we
can
only
think
this
has
happened
and
let
it
unhappen
itself
as
best
it
may
we
say
that
the
time
always
finds
the
man
and
by
it
we
mean
that
when
a
responsibility
is
toward
there
will
be
found
some
shoulder
to
bend
for
the
yoke
which
all
others
shrink
from
it
is
not
always
nor
often
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
who
undertake
these
burdens
it
is
usually
the
good
folk
that
gentle
hierarchy
who
swear
allegiance
to
mournfulness
and
the
under
dog
as
others
dedicate
themselves
to
mutton
chops
and
the
easy
nymph
it
is
not
my
intention
to
idealise
any
of
the
men
who
were
concerned
in
this
rebellion
their
country
will
some
few
years
hence
do
that
as
adequately
as
she
has
done
it
for
those
who
went
before
them
those
of
the
leaders
whom
i
knew
were
not
great
men
nor
brilliant
that
is
they
were
more
scholars
than
thinkers
and
more
thinkers
than
men
of
action
and
i
believe
that
in
no
capacity
could
they
have
attained
to
what
is
called
eminence
nor
do
i
consider
they
coveted
any
such
public
distinction
as
is
noted
in
that
word
but
in
my
definition
they
were
good
men
men
that
is
who
willed
no
evil
and
whose
movements
of
body
or
brain
were
unselfish
and
healthy
no
person
living
is
the
worse
off
for
having
known
thomas
macdonagh
and
i
at
least
have
never
heard
macdonagh
speak
unkindly
or
even
harshly
of
anything
that
lived
it
has
been
said
of
him
that
his
lyrics
were
epical
in
a
measure
it
is
true
and
it
is
true
in
the
same
measure
that
his
death
was
epical
he
was
the
first
of
the
leaders
who
was
tried
and
shot
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
die
leaving
behind
two
young
children
and
a
young
wife
and
the
thought
that
his
last
moment
must
have
been
tormented
by
their
memory
is
very
painful
we
are
all
fatalists
when
we
strike
against
power
and
i
hope
he
put
care
from
him
as
the
soldiers
marched
him
out
the
also
i
knew
but
not
intimately
and
i
can
only
speak
of
a
good
humour
a
courtesy
and
an
energy
that
never
failed
he
was
a
man
of
unceasing
ideas
and
unceasing
speech
and
laughter
accompanied
every
sound
made
by
his
lips
plunkett
and
pearse
i
knew
also
but
not
intimately
young
plunkett
as
he
was
always
called
would
never
strike
one
as
a
militant
person
he
like
pearse
and
macdonagh
wrote
verse
and
it
was
no
better
nor
worse
than
their
were
he
had
an
appetite
for
quaint
and
difficult
knowledge
he
studied
egyptian
and
sanscrit
and
distant
curious
matter
of
that
sort
and
was
interested
in
inventions
and
the
theatre
he
was
tried
and
sentenced
and
shot
as
to
pearse
i
do
not
know
how
to
place
him
nor
what
to
say
of
him
if
there
was
an
idealist
among
the
men
concerned
in
this
insurrection
it
was
he
and
if
there
was
any
person
in
the
world
less
fitted
to
head
an
insurrection
it
was
he
also
i
never
could
touch
or
sense
in
him
the
qualities
which
other
men
spoke
of
and
which
made
him
military
commandant
of
the
rising
none
of
these
men
were
magnetic
in
the
sense
that
larkin
is
magnetic
and
i
would
have
said
that
pearse
was
less
magnetic
than
any
of
the
others
yet
it
was
to
him
and
around
him
they
clung
men
must
find
some
centre
either
of
power
or
action
or
intellect
about
which
they
may
group
themselves
and
i
think
that
pearse
became
the
leader
because
his
temperament
was
more
profoundly
emotional
than
any
of
the
others
he
was
emotional
not
in
a
flighty
but
in
a
serious
way
and
one
felt
more
that
he
suffered
than
that
he
enjoyed
he
had
a
power
men
who
came
into
intimate
contact
with
him
began
to
act
differently
to
their
own
desires
and
interests
his
schoolmasters
did
not
always
receive
their
salaries
with
regularity
the
reason
that
he
did
not
pay
them
was
the
simple
one
that
he
had
no
money
given
by
another
man
this
explanation
would
be
uneconomic
but
from
him
it
was
so
logical
that
even
a
child
could
comprehend
it
these
masters
did
not
always
leave
him
they
remained
marvelling
perhaps
and
accepting
even
with
stupefaction
the
theory
that
children
must
be
taught
but
that
no
such
urgency
is
due
towards
the
payment
of
wages
one
of
his
boys
said
there
was
no
fun
in
telling
lies
to
pearse
for
however
outrageous
the
lie
he
always
believed
it
he
built
and
renovated
and
improved
his
school
because
the
results
were
good
for
his
scholars
and
somehow
he
found
builders
to
undertake
these
forlorn
hopes
it
was
not
i
think
that
he
put
his
trust
in
god
but
that
when
something
had
to
be
done
he
did
it
and
entirely
disregarded
logic
or
economics
or
force
he
said
such
a
thing
has
to
be
done
and
so
far
as
one
man
can
do
it
i
will
do
it
and
he
bowed
straightaway
to
the
task
it
is
mournful
to
think
of
men
like
these
having
to
take
charge
of
bloody
and
desolate
work
and
one
can
imagine
them
say
oh
cursed
spite
as
they
accepted
responsibility
chapter
xi
labour
and
the
insurrection
no
person
in
ireland
seems
to
have
exact
information
about
the
volunteers
their
aims
or
their
numbers
we
know
the
names
of
the
leaders
now
they
were
recited
to
us
with
the
tale
of
their
execution
and
with
the
declaration
of
a
republic
we
learned
something
of
their
aim
but
the
estimate
of
their
number
runs
through
the
figures
ten
thirty
and
fifty
thousand
the
first
figure
is
undoubtedly
too
slender
the
last
excessive
and
something
between
fifteen
and
twenty
thousand
for
all
ireland
would
be
a
reasonable
guess
of
these
the
citizen
army
or
labour
side
of
the
volunteers
would
not
number
more
than
one
thousand
men
and
it
is
with
difficulty
such
a
figure
could
be
arrived
at
yet
it
is
freely
argued
and
the
theory
will
grow
that
the
causes
of
this
latest
insurrection
should
be
sought
among
the
labour
problems
of
dublin
rather
than
in
any
national
or
patriotic
sentiment
and
this
theory
is
buttressed
by
all
the
agile
facts
which
such
a
theory
would
be
furnished
with
it
is
an
interesting
view
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
an
erroneous
one
that
dublin
labour
was
in
the
volunteer
movement
to
the
strength
of
perhaps
two
hundred
men
may
be
true
it
is
possible
there
were
more
but
it
is
unlikely
that
a
greater
number
or
as
many
of
the
citizen
army
marched
when
the
order
came
the
overwhelming
bulk
of
volunteers
were
actuated
by
the
patriotic
ideal
which
is
the
heritage
and
the
burden
of
almost
every
irishman
born
out
of
the
unionist
circle
and
their
connection
with
labour
was
much
more
manual
than
mental
this
view
of
the
importance
of
labour
to
the
volunteers
is
held
by
two
distinct
and
opposed
classes
just
as
there
are
some
who
find
the
explanation
of
life
in
a
sexual
formula
so
there
is
a
class
to
whom
the
economic
idea
is
very
dear
and
beneath
every
human
activity
they
will
discover
the
shock
of
wages
and
profit
it
is
truly
there
but
it
pulls
no
more
than
its
weight
and
in
irish
life
the
part
played
by
labour
has
not
yet
been
a
weighty
one
although
on
every
view
it
is
an
important
one
the
labour
idea
in
ireland
has
not
arrived
it
is
in
process
of
becoming
and
when
labour
problems
are
mentioned
in
this
country
a
party
does
not
come
to
the
mind
but
two
men
only
they
are
larkin
and
james
connolly
and
they
are
each
in
their
way
exceptional
and
curious
men
there
is
another
class
who
implicate
labour
and
they
do
so
because
it
enables
them
to
urge
that
as
well
as
being
grasping
and
nihilistic
irish
labour
is
disloyal
and
treacherous
the
truth
is
that
labour
in
ireland
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
organising
anything
not
even
discontent
it
is
not
to
any
extent
and
outside
of
dublin
it
scarcely
appears
to
exist
the
national
imagination
is
not
free
to
deal
with
any
other
subject
than
that
of
freedom
and
part
of
the
policy
of
our
masters
is
to
see
that
we
be
kept
busy
with
politics
instead
of
social
ideas
from
their
standpoint
the
policy
is
admirable
and
up
to
the
present
it
has
thoroughly
succeeded
one
does
not
hear
from
the
lips
of
the
irish
workingman
even
in
dublin
any
of
the
affirmations
and
rejections
which
have
long
since
become
the
commonplaces
of
his
comrades
in
other
lands
but
on
the
subject
of
irish
freedom
his
views
are
instantly
forthcoming
and
his
desires
are
explicit
and
to
a
degree
informed
this
latter
subject
they
understand
and
have
fabricated
an
entire
language
to
express
it
but
the
other
they
do
not
understand
nor
cherish
and
they
are
not
prepared
to
die
for
it
it
is
possibly
true
that
before
any
movement
can
attain
to
really
national
proportions
there
must
be
as
well
as
the
intellectual
ideal
which
gives
it
utterance
and
a
frame
a
sense
of
economic
misfortune
to
give
it
weight
and
when
these
fuse
the
combination
may
well
be
irresistible
the
organised
labour
discontent
in
ireland
in
dublin
was
not
considerable
enough
to
impose
its
aims
or
its
colours
on
the
volunteers
and
it
is
the
labour
ideal
which
merges
and
disappears
in
the
national
one
the
reputation
of
all
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
not
excepting
connolly
is
that
they
were
intensely
patriotic
irishmen
and
also
but
this
time
with
the
exception
of
connolly
that
they
were
not
particularly
interested
in
the
problems
of
labour
the
great
strike
of
two
years
ago
remained
undoubtedly
as
a
bitter
and
lasting
memory
with
dublin
labour
perhaps
even
it
was
not
so
much
a
memory
as
a
hatred
still
it
was
not
hatred
of
england
which
was
evoked
at
that
time
nor
can
the
stress
of
their
conflict
be
traced
to
an
english
source
it
was
hatred
of
local
traders
and
particularly
hatred
of
the
local
police
and
the
local
powers
and
tribunals
which
were
arrayed
against
them
one
can
without
trouble
discover
reasons
why
they
should
go
on
strike
again
but
by
no
reasoning
can
i
understand
why
they
should
go
into
rebellion
against
england
unless
it
was
that
they
were
patriots
first
and
trade
unionists
a
very
long
way
afterwards
i
do
not
believe
that
this
combination
of
the
ideal
and
the
practical
was
consummated
in
the
dublin
insurrection
but
i
do
believe
that
the
first
step
towards
the
formation
of
such
a
party
has
now
been
taken
and
that
if
years
hence
there
should
be
further
trouble
in
ireland
such
trouble
will
not
be
so
easily
dealt
with
as
this
one
has
been
it
may
be
that
further
trouble
will
not
arise
for
the
movement
which
is
growing
slowly
but
steadily
in
ireland
may
arrange
our
economic
question
and
incidentally
our
national
question
also
that
is
if
the
english
people
do
not
decide
that
the
latter
ought
to
be
settled
at
once
james
connolly
had
his
heart
in
both
the
national
and
the
economic
camp
but
he
was
a
man
and
could
afford
to
extend
his
affections
where
others
could
only
dissipate
them
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
powers
of
orderly
thinking
were
of
great
service
to
the
volunteers
for
while
larkin
was
the
magnetic
centre
of
the
irish
labour
movement
connolly
was
its
brains
he
has
been
sentenced
to
death
for
his
part
in
the
insurrection
and
for
two
days
now
he
has
been
dead
he
had
been
severely
wounded
in
the
fighting
and
was
tended
one
does
not
doubt
with
great
care
until
he
regained
enough
strength
to
stand
up
and
be
shot
down
again
others
are
dead
also
i
was
not
acquainted
with
them
and
with
connolly
i
was
not
more
than
acquainted
i
had
met
him
twice
many
months
ago
but
other
people
were
present
each
time
and
he
scarcely
uttered
a
word
on
either
of
these
occasions
i
was
told
that
he
was
by
nature
silent
he
was
a
man
who
can
be
in
ireland
but
labour
throughout
the
world
may
mourn
for
him
also
a
doctor
who
attended
on
him
during
his
last
hours
says
that
connolly
received
the
sentence
of
his
death
quietly
he
was
to
be
shot
on
the
morning
following
the
sentence
this
gentleman
said
to
him
connolly
when
you
stand
up
to
be
shot
will
you
say
a
prayer
for
me
connolly
replied
i
will
his
visitor
continued
will
you
say
a
prayer
for
the
men
who
are
shooting
you
i
will
said
connolly
and
i
will
say
a
prayer
for
every
good
man
in
the
world
who
is
doing
his
duty
he
was
a
steadfast
man
in
all
that
he
undertook
we
may
be
sure
he
steadfastly
kept
that
promise
he
would
pray
for
others
who
had
not
time
to
pray
for
himself
as
he
had
worked
for
others
during
the
years
when
he
might
have
worked
for
himself
chapter
xii
the
irish
questions
there
is
truly
an
irish
question
there
are
two
irish
questions
and
the
most
important
of
them
is
not
that
which
appears
in
our
newspapers
and
in
our
political
propaganda
the
first
is
international
and
can
be
stated
shortly
it
is
the
desire
of
ireland
to
assume
control
of
her
national
life
with
this
desire
the
english
people
have
professed
to
be
in
accord
and
it
is
at
any
rate
so
thoroughly
understood
that
nothing
further
need
be
made
of
it
in
these
pages
the
other
irish
question
is
different
and
less
simply
described
the
difficulty
about
it
is
that
it
can
not
be
approached
until
the
question
of
ireland
freedom
has
by
some
means
been
settled
for
this
ideal
of
freedom
has
captured
the
imagination
of
the
race
it
rides
ireland
like
a
nightmare
thwarting
or
preventing
all
civilising
or
cultural
work
in
this
country
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
ireland
can
not
even
begin
to
live
until
that
obsession
and
fever
has
come
to
an
end
and
her
imagination
has
been
set
free
to
do
the
work
which
imagination
alone
can
do
imagination
is
intelligent
kindness
we
have
sore
need
of
it
the
second
question
might
plausibly
be
called
a
religious
one
it
has
been
so
called
and
for
it
is
less
troublesome
to
accept
an
idea
than
to
question
it
the
statement
has
been
accepted
as
truth
but
it
is
untrue
and
it
is
deeply
and
villainously
untrue
no
lie
in
irish
life
has
been
so
persistent
and
so
mischievous
as
this
one
and
no
political
lie
has
ever
been
so
ingeniously
and
malevolently
exploited
there
is
no
religious
intolerance
in
ireland
except
that
which
is
political
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
catholic
church
and
am
not
inclined
to
be
the
advocate
of
a
religious
system
which
my
mentality
dislikes
but
i
have
never
found
real
intolerance
among
my
of
that
religion
i
have
found
it
among
protestants
i
will
limit
that
statement
too
i
have
found
it
among
some
protestants
but
outside
of
the
north
of
ireland
there
is
no
religious
question
and
in
the
north
it
is
fundamentally
more
political
than
religious
all
thinking
is
a
fining
down
of
one
ideas
and
thus
far
we
have
come
to
the
statement
of
ireland
second
question
it
is
not
catholic
or
nationalist
nor
have
i
said
that
it
is
entirely
protestant
and
unionist
but
it
is
on
the
extreme
wing
of
this
latter
party
that
responsibility
must
be
laid
it
is
difficult
even
for
an
irishman
living
in
ireland
to
come
on
the
real
political
fact
which
underlies
irish
protestant
politics
and
which
fact
has
consistently
opposed
and
baffled
every
attempt
made
by
either
england
or
ireland
to
come
to
terms
there
is
such
a
fact
and
clustered
around
it
is
a
body
of
men
whose
hatred
of
their
country
is
persistent
and
deadly
and
unexplained
one
may
make
broad
generalisations
on
the
apparent
situation
and
endeavour
to
solve
it
by
those
we
may
say
that
loyalty
to
england
is
the
true
centre
of
their
action
i
will
believe
it
but
only
to
a
point
loyalty
to
england
does
not
inevitably
include
this
active
hatred
this
blindness
this
withering
of
all
sympathy
for
the
people
among
whom
one
is
born
and
among
whom
one
has
lived
in
peace
for
they
have
lived
in
peace
amongst
us
we
may
say
that
it
is
due
to
the
idea
of
privilege
and
the
desire
for
power
again
i
will
accept
it
up
to
a
point
but
these
are
cultural
obsessions
and
they
cease
to
act
when
the
is
reached
i
know
of
only
two
mental
states
which
are
utterly
without
bowels
or
conscience
these
are
cowardice
and
greed
is
it
to
a
synthesis
of
these
states
that
this
more
than
mortal
enmity
may
be
traced
what
do
they
fear
and
what
is
it
they
covet
what
can
they
redoubt
in
a
country
which
is
practically
crimeless
or
covet
in
a
land
that
is
almost
as
bare
as
a
mutton
bone
they
have
mesmerised
themselves
these
men
and
have
imagined
into
our
quiet
air
brigands
and
thugs
and
titans
with
all
the
other
notabilities
of
a
tale
for
children
i
do
not
think
that
this
either
will
tell
the
tale
but
i
do
think
there
is
a
story
to
be
told
i
imagine
an
esoteric
wing
to
the
unionist
party
i
imagine
that
party
includes
a
secret
organisation
they
may
be
orangemen
they
may
be
masons
and
if
there
be
such
i
would
dearly
like
to
know
what
the
metaphysic
of
their
position
is
and
how
they
square
it
with
any
idea
of
humanity
or
social
life
meantime
all
this
is
surmise
and
i
as
a
novelist
have
a
notoriously
flighty
imagination
and
am
content
to
leave
it
at
that
but
this
secondary
irish
question
is
not
so
terrible
as
it
appears
it
is
terrible
now
it
would
not
be
terrible
if
ireland
had
national
independence
the
great
protection
against
a
lie
is
not
to
believe
it
and
ireland
in
this
instance
has
that
protection
the
claims
made
by
the
unionist
wing
do
not
rely
solely
on
the
religious
base
they
use
all
the
arguments
it
is
according
to
them
unsafe
to
live
in
ireland
let
us
leave
this
insurrection
of
a
week
out
of
the
question
life
is
not
safe
in
ireland
property
shivers
in
terror
of
daily
or
nightly
appropriation
other
undefined
but
even
more
woeful
glooms
and
creeps
wriggle
stealthily
abroad
these
things
are
not
regarded
in
ireland
and
in
truth
they
are
not
meat
for
irish
consumption
irish
judges
are
presented
with
white
gloves
with
a
regularity
which
may
even
be
annoying
to
them
and
were
it
not
for
political
trouble
they
would
be
unable
to
look
their
salaries
in
the
face
the
irish
bar
almost
weep
in
chorus
at
the
words
land
act
and
stare
not
dumbly
on
destitution
these
tales
are
meant
for
england
and
are
sent
there
they
will
cease
to
be
exported
when
there
is
no
market
for
them
and
these
men
will
perhaps
end
by
becoming
patriotic
and
social
when
they
learn
that
they
do
not
really
command
the
big
battalions
but
ireland
has
no
protection
against
them
while
england
can
be
thrilled
by
their
nonsense
and
while
she
is
willing
to
pound
ireland
to
a
jelly
on
their
appeal
her
only
assistance
against
them
is
freedom
there
are
certain
simplicities
upon
which
all
life
is
based
a
man
finds
that
he
is
hungry
and
the
knowledge
enables
him
to
go
to
work
for
the
rest
of
his
life
a
man
makes
the
discovery
it
has
been
a
discovery
to
many
that
he
is
an
irishman
and
the
knowledge
simplifies
all
his
subsequent
political
action
there
is
this
comfort
about
being
an
irishman
you
can
be
entirely
irish
and
claim
thus
to
be
as
complete
as
a
pebble
or
a
star
but
no
irish
person
can
hope
to
be
more
than
a
muletto
englishman
and
if
that
be
an
ambition
and
an
end
it
is
not
an
heroic
one
but
there
is
an
ulster
difficulty
and
no
amount
of
burking
it
will
solve
it
it
is
too
generally
conceived
among
nationalists
that
the
attitude
of
ulster
towards
ireland
is
rooted
in
ignorance
and
bigotry
allow
that
both
of
these
bad
parts
are
included
in
the
northern
outlook
they
do
not
explain
the
ulster
standpoint
and
nothing
can
explain
the
attitude
of
official
ireland
with
ulster
what
has
the
irish
party
ever
done
to
allay
northern
prejudice
or
bring
the
discontented
section
into
line
with
the
rest
of
ireland
the
answer
is
pathetically
complete
they
have
done
nothing
or
if
they
have
done
anything
it
was
only
that
which
would
set
every
northerner
grinding
his
teeth
in
anger
at
a
time
when
orangeism
was
dying
they
raised
and
marshalled
the
hibernians
and
we
have
the
ulsterman
answer
to
the
hibernians
in
the
situation
by
which
we
are
confronted
if
the
party
had
even
a
little
statesmanship
among
them
they
would
for
the
past
ten
years
have
marched
up
and
down
the
north
explaining
and
mollifying
and
courting
the
black
northerner
but
like
good
irishmen
they
could
not
tear
themselves
away
from
england
and
they
paraded
that
country
where
parade
was
not
so
urgent
and
they
made
orations
there
until
the
mere
accent
of
an
irishman
must
make
englishmen
wail
for
very
boredom
some
of
that
parade
might
have
gladdened
the
eyes
of
the
belfast
citizens
a
few
of
those
orations
might
have
assisted
the
men
of
derry
to
comprehend
that
for
the
good
of
our
common
land
home
rule
and
the
unity
of
a
nation
was
necessary
if
only
to
rid
the
country
of
these
blatherers
let
the
party
explain
why
among
their
political
duties
they
neglected
the
duty
of
placating
ulster
in
their
proper
persons
why
in
short
they
boycotted
ulster
and
permitted
political
and
religious
and
racial
antagonism
to
grow
inside
of
ireland
unchecked
by
any
word
from
them
upon
that
ground
were
they
afraid
nuts
would
be
thrown
at
them
whatever
they
dreaded
they
gave
ulster
the
widest
of
wide
berths
and
wherever
else
they
were
visible
and
audible
they
were
silent
and
unseen
in
that
part
of
ireland
the
ulster
grievance
is
ostensibly
religious
but
safeguards
on
this
count
are
so
easily
created
and
applied
that
this
issue
might
almost
be
left
out
of
account
the
real
difficulty
is
economic
and
it
is
a
tangled
one
but
unless
profit
and
loss
are
immediately
discernible
the
soul
of
man
is
not
easily
stirred
by
an
accountant
tale
and
therefore
the
religious
banner
has
been
waved
for
our
kinsfolk
of
ulster
and
under
the
sacred
emblem
they
are
fighting
for
what
some
people
call
mammon
but
which
may
be
in
truth
just
plain
bread
and
butter
the
words
sinn
fein
mean
ourselves
and
it
is
of
ourselves
i
write
in
this
chapter
more
urgent
than
any
political
emancipation
is
the
drawing
together
of
men
of
good
will
in
the
endeavour
to
assist
their
necessitous
land
our
eyes
must
be
withdrawn
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
fixed
on
that
which
is
around
us
and
which
we
can
touch
no
politician
will
talk
to
us
of
ireland
if
by
any
trick
he
can
avoid
the
subject
his
tale
is
still
of
westminster
and
chimborazo
and
the
mountains
of
the
moon
irishmen
must
begin
to
think
for
themselves
and
of
themselves
instead
of
expending
energy
on
causes
too
distant
to
be
assisted
or
hindered
by
them
i
believe
that
our
human
material
is
as
good
as
will
be
found
in
the
world
no
better
perhaps
but
not
worse
and
i
believe
that
all
but
local
politics
are
unfruitful
and
we
have
an
island
that
is
called
little
it
is
more
than
twenty
times
too
spacious
for
our
needs
and
we
will
not
have
explored
the
last
of
it
in
our
children
lifetime
we
have
more
problems
to
resolve
in
our
towns
and
cities
than
many
generations
of
minds
will
get
tired
of
striving
with
here
is
the
world
and
all
that
perplexes
or
delights
the
world
is
here
also
nothing
is
lost
not
even
brave
men
they
have
been
used
from
this
day
the
great
adventure
opens
for
ireland
the
volunteers
are
dead
and
the
call
is
now
for
volunteers
