julith
clasped
the
arm
with
one
hand
while
her
other
arm
gripped
his
waist
the
generator
in
jorun
skull
responded
to
his
will
they
rose
quietly
and
went
slowly
seaward
look
around
you
jorun
of
fulkhis
this
is
this
is
the
old
home
of
all
mankind
you
can
not
go
off
and
forget
it
man
can
not
do
so
it
is
in
him
in
his
blood
and
bones
and
soul
he
will
carry
earth
within
him
forever
no
said
the
old
man
but
you
do
realize
what
it
means
said
jorun
you
do
know
what
you
saying
the
old
man
kormt
of
huerdar
gerlaug
son
and
speaker
for
solis
township
shook
his
head
till
the
long
grizzled
locks
swirled
around
his
wide
shoulders
i
have
thought
it
through
he
said
his
voice
was
deep
and
slow
and
implacable
you
gave
me
five
years
to
think
about
it
and
my
answer
is
no
jorun
felt
a
weariness
rise
within
him
it
had
been
like
this
for
days
now
weeks
and
it
was
like
trying
to
knock
down
a
mountain
you
beat
on
its
rocky
flanks
till
your
hands
were
bloody
and
still
the
mountain
stood
there
sunlight
on
its
high
and
in
the
forests
that
rustled
up
its
slopes
and
it
did
not
really
notice
you
you
were
a
brief
thin
buzz
between
two
long
nights
but
the
mountain
was
forever
you
have
thought
at
all
he
said
with
a
rudeness
born
of
exhaustion
you
only
reacted
unthinkingly
to
a
dead
symbol
it
not
a
human
reaction
even
it
a
verbal
reflex
kormt
eyes
meshed
in
were
serene
and
steady
under
the
thick
gray
brows
he
smiled
a
little
in
his
long
beard
but
made
no
other
reply
had
he
simply
let
the
insult
glide
off
him
or
had
he
not
understood
it
at
all
there
was
no
real
talking
to
these
peasants
too
many
millennia
lay
between
and
you
could
shout
across
that
gulf
well
said
jorun
the
ships
will
be
here
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
and
it
take
another
day
or
so
to
get
all
your
people
aboard
you
have
that
long
to
decide
but
after
that
it
be
too
late
think
about
it
i
beg
of
you
as
for
me
i
be
too
busy
to
argue
further
you
are
a
good
man
said
kormt
and
a
wise
one
in
your
fashion
but
you
are
blind
there
is
something
dead
inside
you
he
waved
one
huge
gnarled
hand
look
around
you
jorun
of
fulkhis
this
is
this
is
the
old
home
of
all
humankind
you
can
not
go
off
and
forget
it
man
can
not
do
so
it
is
in
him
in
his
blood
and
bones
and
bones
and
soul
he
will
carry
earth
within
him
forever
jorun
eyes
traveled
along
the
arc
of
the
hand
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
town
behind
him
were
its
houses
low
white
roofed
with
thatch
or
red
tile
smoke
rising
from
the
chimneys
carved
galleries
overhung
the
narrow
cobbled
streets
he
heard
the
noise
of
wheels
and
wooden
clogs
the
shouts
of
children
at
play
beyond
that
were
trees
and
the
incredible
ruined
walls
of
sol
city
in
front
of
him
the
wooded
hills
were
cleared
and
a
gentle
landscape
of
neat
fields
and
orchards
rolled
down
toward
the
distant
glitter
of
the
sea
scattered
farm
buildings
drowsy
cattle
winding
gravel
roads
of
ancient
marble
and
granite
all
dreaming
under
the
sun
he
drew
a
deep
breath
it
was
pungent
in
his
nostrils
it
smelled
of
plowed
earth
baking
in
the
warmth
summery
trees
and
gardens
a
remote
ocean
odor
of
salt
and
kelp
and
fish
he
thought
that
no
two
planets
ever
had
quite
the
same
smell
and
that
none
was
as
rich
as
terra
this
is
a
fair
world
he
said
slowly
it
is
the
only
one
said
kormt
man
came
from
here
and
to
this
in
the
end
he
must
return
i
wonder
jorun
sighed
take
me
not
one
atom
of
my
body
was
from
this
soil
before
i
landed
my
people
lived
on
fulkhis
for
ages
and
changed
to
meet
its
conditions
they
would
not
be
happy
on
terra
the
atoms
are
nothing
said
kormt
it
is
the
form
which
matters
and
that
was
given
to
you
by
earth
jorun
studied
him
for
a
moment
kormt
was
like
most
of
this
planet
ten
million
or
so
people
a
dark
stocky
folk
though
there
were
more
blond
and
throwbacks
here
than
in
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
he
was
old
for
a
primitive
untreated
by
medical
science
he
must
be
almost
two
hundred
years
old
but
his
back
was
straight
and
his
stride
firm
the
coarse
face
held
an
odd
strength
jorun
was
nearing
his
thousandth
birthday
but
could
help
feeling
like
a
child
in
presence
that
did
make
sense
these
few
dwellers
on
terra
were
a
backward
and
impoverished
race
of
peasants
and
handicraftsmen
they
were
ignorant
and
unadventurous
they
had
been
static
for
more
thousands
of
years
than
anyone
knew
what
could
they
have
to
say
to
the
ancient
and
mighty
civilization
which
had
almost
forgotten
their
little
planet
kormt
looked
at
the
declining
sun
i
must
go
now
he
said
there
are
the
evening
chores
to
do
i
will
be
in
town
tonight
if
you
should
wish
to
see
me
i
probably
will
said
jorun
there
a
lot
to
do
readying
the
evacuation
and
you
a
big
help
the
old
man
bowed
with
grave
courtesy
turned
and
walked
off
down
the
road
he
wore
the
common
costume
of
terran
men
as
archaic
in
style
as
in
its
material
hat
jacket
loose
trousers
a
long
staff
in
his
hand
contrasting
the
drab
blue
of
kormt
dress
jorun
vivid
tunic
of
shifting
rainbow
hues
was
like
a
flame
the
psychotechnician
sighed
again
watching
him
go
he
liked
the
old
fellow
it
would
be
criminal
to
leave
him
here
alone
but
the
law
forbade
force
physical
or
mental
and
the
integrator
on
corazuno
going
to
care
whether
or
not
one
aged
man
stayed
behind
the
job
was
to
get
the
off
terra
lovely
jorun
thin
mobile
features
and
turned
around
the
horizon
fair
world
we
came
there
were
more
beautiful
planets
in
the
galaxy
swarming
myriads
the
indigo
of
loa
jeweled
with
islands
the
mountains
of
sharang
the
sky
of
jareb
that
seemed
to
drip
light
oh
many
and
many
but
there
was
only
one
earth
jorun
remembered
his
first
sight
of
this
world
hanging
free
in
space
to
watch
it
after
the
gruelling
run
thirty
thousand
from
corazuno
it
was
blue
as
it
turned
before
his
eyes
a
burnished
turquoise
shield
blazoned
with
the
living
green
and
brown
of
its
lands
and
the
poles
were
crowned
with
a
flimmering
haze
of
aurora
the
belts
that
streaked
its
face
and
blurred
the
continents
were
cloud
wind
and
water
and
the
gray
rush
of
rain
like
a
benediction
from
heaven
beyond
the
planet
hung
its
moon
a
scarred
golden
crescent
and
he
had
wondered
how
many
generations
of
men
had
looked
up
to
it
or
watched
its
light
like
a
broken
bridge
across
moving
waters
against
the
enormous
cold
of
the
sky
utter
black
out
to
the
distant
coils
of
the
nebulae
thronging
with
a
million
frosty
points
of
blaze
that
were
the
stars
earth
had
stood
as
a
sign
of
haven
to
jorun
who
came
from
galactic
center
and
its
uncountable
hosts
of
suns
heaven
was
bare
this
was
the
outer
fringe
where
the
stars
thinned
away
toward
hideous
immensity
he
had
shivered
a
little
drawn
the
envelope
of
air
and
warmth
closer
about
him
with
a
convulsive
movement
the
silence
drummed
in
his
head
then
he
streaked
for
the
rendezvous
of
his
group
he
thought
now
have
a
pretty
routine
job
the
first
expedition
here
five
years
ago
prepared
the
natives
for
the
fact
they
have
to
go
our
party
simply
has
to
organize
these
docile
peasants
in
time
for
the
but
it
had
meant
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
he
was
tired
it
would
be
good
to
finish
the
job
and
get
back
home
or
would
it
he
thought
of
flying
with
zarek
his
from
the
rendezvous
to
this
area
assigned
as
theirs
plains
like
oceans
of
grass
darkened
with
the
herds
of
wild
cattle
whose
hoofbeats
were
a
thunder
in
the
earth
forests
hundreds
of
kilometers
of
old
and
mighty
trees
rivers
piercing
them
in
a
long
steel
gleam
lakes
where
fish
leaped
spilling
sunshine
like
warm
rain
radiance
so
bright
it
hurt
his
eyes
swift
across
the
land
it
had
all
been
empty
of
man
but
still
there
was
a
vitality
here
which
was
almost
frightening
to
jorun
his
own
grim
world
of
moors
and
crags
and
seas
was
a
niggard
beside
this
here
life
covered
the
earth
filled
the
oceans
and
made
the
heavens
clangerous
around
him
he
wondered
if
the
driving
energy
within
man
the
force
which
had
raised
him
to
the
stars
made
him
and
if
that
was
a
legacy
of
terra
well
man
had
changed
over
the
thousands
of
years
natural
and
controlled
adaptation
had
fitted
him
to
the
worlds
he
had
colonized
and
most
of
his
many
races
could
not
now
feel
at
home
here
jorun
thought
of
his
own
party
round
chuli
from
a
tropic
world
complaining
bitterly
about
the
cold
and
dryness
gay
young
cluthe
gangling
and
sophisticated
taliuvenna
of
the
flowing
dark
hair
and
the
lustrous
eyes
no
to
them
earth
was
only
one
more
planet
out
of
thousands
they
had
seen
in
their
long
lives
i
a
sentimental
he
could
have
willed
the
vague
regret
out
of
his
trained
nervous
system
but
he
did
want
to
this
was
the
last
time
human
eyes
would
ever
look
on
earth
and
somehow
jorun
felt
that
it
should
be
more
to
him
than
just
another
psychotechnic
job
hello
good
sir
he
turned
at
the
voice
and
forced
his
tired
lips
into
a
friendly
smile
hello
julith
he
said
it
was
a
wise
policy
to
learn
the
names
of
the
townspeople
at
least
and
she
was
a
of
the
speaker
she
was
some
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
a
child
with
a
shy
smile
and
steady
green
eyes
there
was
a
certain
awkward
grace
about
her
and
she
seemed
more
imaginative
than
most
of
her
stolid
race
she
curtsied
quaintly
for
him
her
bare
foot
reaching
out
under
the
long
smock
which
was
daily
female
dress
here
are
you
busy
good
sir
she
asked
well
not
too
much
said
jorun
he
was
glad
of
a
chance
to
talk
it
silenced
his
thoughts
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
wondered
she
hesitated
then
breathlessly
i
wonder
if
you
could
give
me
a
lift
down
to
the
beach
only
for
an
hour
or
two
it
too
far
to
walk
there
before
i
have
to
be
home
and
i
ca
borrow
a
car
or
even
a
horse
if
it
wo
be
any
trouble
sir
mmmm
should
you
be
at
home
now
is
there
milking
and
so
on
to
do
oh
i
do
live
on
a
farm
good
sir
my
father
is
a
baker
yes
yes
so
he
is
i
should
have
remembered
jorun
considered
for
an
instant
there
was
enough
to
do
in
town
and
it
was
fair
for
him
to
play
hooky
while
zarek
worked
alone
why
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
beach
julith
we
be
busy
packing
up
she
said
starting
tomorrow
i
guess
this
is
my
last
chance
to
see
it
jorun
mouth
twisted
a
little
all
right
he
said
i
take
you
you
are
very
kind
good
sir
she
said
gravely
he
did
reply
but
held
out
his
arm
and
she
clasped
it
with
one
hand
while
her
other
arm
gripped
his
waist
the
generator
inside
his
skull
responded
to
his
will
reaching
out
and
clawing
itself
to
the
fabric
of
forces
and
energies
which
was
physical
space
they
rose
quietly
and
went
so
slowly
seaward
that
he
did
have
to
raise
a
will
we
be
able
to
fly
like
this
when
we
get
to
the
stars
she
asked
i
afraid
not
julith
he
said
you
see
the
people
of
my
civilization
are
born
this
way
thousands
of
years
ago
men
learned
how
to
control
the
great
basic
forces
of
the
cosmos
with
only
a
small
bit
of
energy
finally
they
used
artificial
mutation
that
is
they
changed
themselves
slowly
over
many
generations
until
their
brains
grew
a
new
part
that
could
generate
this
controlling
force
we
can
now
even
fly
between
the
stars
by
this
power
but
your
people
do
have
that
brain
so
we
had
to
build
spaceships
to
take
you
away
i
see
she
said
your
can
be
like
us
if
your
people
want
to
be
changed
thus
he
said
they
did
want
to
change
before
she
answered
i
do
think
they
do
it
now
even
in
their
new
home
her
voice
held
no
bitterness
it
was
an
acceptance
privately
jorun
doubted
it
the
psychic
shock
of
this
uprooting
would
be
bound
to
destroy
the
old
traditions
of
the
terrans
it
would
not
take
many
centuries
before
they
were
culturally
assimilated
by
galactic
civilization
assimilated
nice
euphemism
why
not
just
say
eaten
they
landed
on
the
beach
it
was
broad
and
white
running
in
dunes
from
the
thin
harsh
grass
to
the
roar
and
tumble
of
surf
the
sun
was
low
over
the
watery
horizon
filling
the
damp
blowing
air
with
gold
jorun
could
almost
look
directly
at
its
huge
disc
he
sat
down
the
sand
gritted
tinily
under
him
and
the
wind
rumpled
his
hair
and
filled
his
nostrils
with
its
sharp
wet
smell
he
picked
up
a
conch
and
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
wondering
at
the
intricate
architecture
of
it
if
you
hold
it
to
your
ear
said
julith
you
can
hear
the
sea
her
childish
voice
was
curiously
tender
around
the
rough
syllables
of
earth
language
he
nodded
and
obeyed
her
hint
it
was
only
the
small
pulse
of
blood
within
him
you
heard
the
same
thing
out
in
the
great
hollow
silence
of
space
but
it
did
sing
of
restless
immensities
wind
and
foam
and
the
long
waves
marching
under
the
moon
i
have
two
of
them
myself
said
julith
i
want
them
so
i
can
always
remember
this
beach
and
my
children
and
their
children
will
hold
them
too
and
hear
our
sea
talking
she
folded
his
fingers
around
the
shell
you
keep
this
one
for
yourself
thank
you
he
said
i
will
the
combers
rolled
in
booming
and
spouting
against
the
land
the
terrans
called
them
the
horses
of
god
a
thin
cloud
in
the
west
was
turning
rose
and
gold
are
there
oceans
on
our
new
planet
asked
julith
yes
he
said
it
the
most
world
we
could
find
that
was
already
inhabited
you
be
happy
there
the
trees
and
grasses
the
soil
and
the
fruits
thereof
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
fish
of
the
waters
beneath
form
and
color
smell
and
sound
taste
and
texture
everything
is
different
is
alien
the
difference
is
small
subtle
but
it
is
the
abyss
of
two
billion
years
of
separate
evolution
and
no
other
world
can
ever
quite
be
julith
looked
straight
at
him
with
solemn
eyes
are
you
folk
afraid
of
hulduvians
she
asked
why
no
he
said
of
course
not
then
why
are
you
giving
earth
to
them
it
was
a
soft
question
but
it
trembled
just
a
little
i
thought
all
your
people
understood
the
reason
by
now
said
jorun
civilization
the
civilization
of
man
and
his
nonhuman
allies
has
moved
inward
toward
the
great
of
galactic
center
this
part
of
space
means
nothing
to
us
any
more
it
almost
a
desert
you
have
seen
starlight
till
you
been
by
sagittarius
now
the
hulduvians
are
another
civilization
they
are
not
the
least
bit
like
us
they
live
on
big
poisonous
worlds
like
jupiter
and
saturn
i
think
they
would
seem
like
pretty
nice
monsters
if
they
were
so
alien
to
us
that
neither
side
can
really
understand
the
other
they
use
the
cosmic
energies
too
but
in
a
different
way
and
their
way
interferes
with
ours
just
as
ours
interferes
with
theirs
different
brains
you
see
anyway
it
was
decided
that
the
two
civilizations
would
get
along
best
by
just
staying
away
from
each
other
if
they
divided
up
the
galaxy
between
them
there
would
be
no
interference
it
would
be
too
far
from
one
civilization
to
the
other
the
hulduvians
were
really
very
nice
about
it
they
willing
to
take
the
outer
rim
even
if
there
are
fewer
stars
and
let
us
have
the
center
so
by
the
agreement
we
got
to
have
all
men
and
manlike
beings
out
of
their
territory
before
they
come
to
settle
it
just
as
they
move
out
of
ours
their
colonists
wo
be
coming
to
jupiter
and
saturn
for
centuries
yet
but
even
so
we
have
to
clear
the
sirius
sector
now
because
there
be
a
lot
of
work
to
do
elsewhere
fortunately
there
are
only
a
few
people
living
in
this
whole
part
of
space
the
sirius
sector
has
been
an
isolated
primi
ah
quiet
region
since
the
first
empire
fell
fifty
thousand
years
ago
julith
voice
rose
a
little
but
those
people
are
and
the
folk
of
alpha
centauri
and
procyon
and
sirius
and
oh
hundreds
of
other
stars
yet
all
of
you
together
are
only
one
tiny
drop
in
the
quadrillions
of
the
galaxy
do
you
see
julith
you
have
to
move
for
the
good
of
all
of
us
yes
she
said
yes
i
know
all
that
she
got
up
shaking
herself
let
go
swimming
jorun
smiled
and
shook
his
head
no
i
wait
for
you
if
you
want
to
go
she
nodded
and
ran
off
down
the
beach
sheltering
behind
a
dune
to
put
on
a
the
terrans
had
a
nudity
taboo
in
spite
of
the
mild
interglacial
climate
typical
primitive
irrationality
jorun
lay
back
folding
his
arms
behind
his
head
and
looked
up
at
the
darkening
sky
the
evening
star
twinkled
forth
low
and
white
on
the
horizon
venus
or
was
it
mercury
he
was
sure
he
wished
he
knew
more
about
the
early
history
of
the
solar
system
the
first
men
to
ride
their
thunderous
rockets
out
to
die
on
unknown
the
first
clumsy
steps
toward
the
stars
he
could
look
it
up
in
the
archives
of
corazuno
but
he
knew
he
never
would
too
much
else
to
do
too
much
to
remember
probably
less
than
one
percent
of
mankind
throngs
even
knew
where
earth
was
today
though
for
a
while
it
had
been
quite
a
but
that
was
perhaps
thirty
thousand
years
ago
this
world
out
of
all
the
billions
has
certain
physical
he
thought
race
has
made
them
into
standards
our
basic
units
of
length
and
time
and
acceleration
our
comparisons
by
which
we
classify
the
swarming
planets
of
the
galaxy
they
all
go
back
ultimately
to
earth
we
bear
that
unspoken
memorial
to
our
birthplace
within
our
whole
civilization
and
will
bear
it
forever
but
has
she
given
us
more
than
that
are
our
own
selves
bodies
and
minds
and
dreams
are
they
also
the
children
of
earth
now
he
was
thinking
like
kormt
stubborn
old
kormt
who
clung
with
such
a
blind
strength
to
this
land
simply
because
it
was
his
when
you
considered
all
the
races
of
this
species
how
many
of
them
there
were
how
many
kinds
of
man
between
the
stars
and
yet
they
all
walked
upright
they
all
had
two
eyes
and
a
nose
between
and
a
mouth
below
they
were
all
cells
of
that
great
and
ancient
culture
which
had
begun
here
eons
past
with
the
first
hairy
who
kindled
a
fire
against
night
if
earth
had
not
had
darkness
and
cold
and
prowling
beasts
oxygen
and
cellulose
and
flint
that
culture
might
never
have
gestated
getting
unlogical
too
tired
nerves
worn
too
thin
psychosomatic
control
slipping
now
earth
is
becoming
some
obscure
for
has
she
always
been
one
for
the
whole
race
of
us
a
seagull
cried
harshly
overhead
and
soared
from
view
the
sunset
was
smoldering
away
and
dusk
rose
like
fog
out
of
the
ground
julith
came
running
back
to
him
her
face
indistinct
in
the
gloom
she
was
breathing
hard
and
he
could
tell
if
the
catch
in
her
voice
was
laughter
or
weeping
i
better
be
getting
home
she
said
they
flew
slowly
back
the
town
was
a
yellow
twinkle
of
lights
warmth
gleaming
from
windows
across
many
empty
kilometers
jorun
set
the
girl
down
outside
her
home
thank
you
good
sir
she
said
curtseying
wo
you
come
in
to
dinner
well
the
door
opened
etching
the
girl
black
against
the
ruddiness
inside
jorun
luminous
tunic
made
him
like
a
torch
in
the
dark
why
it
the
said
a
woman
voice
i
took
your
daughter
for
a
swim
he
explained
i
hope
you
mind
and
if
we
did
what
would
it
matter
grumbled
a
bass
tone
jorun
recognized
kormt
the
old
man
must
have
come
as
a
guest
from
his
farm
on
the
outskirts
what
could
we
do
about
it
now
granther
that
no
way
to
talk
to
the
gentleman
said
the
woman
he
been
very
kind
wo
you
come
eat
with
us
good
sir
jorun
refused
twice
in
case
they
were
only
being
polite
then
accepted
gladly
enough
he
was
tired
of
cookery
at
the
inn
where
he
and
zarek
boarded
thank
you
he
entered
ducking
under
the
low
door
a
single
long
room
was
kitchen
diningroom
and
parlor
doors
led
off
to
the
sleeping
quarters
it
was
furnished
with
a
clumsy
elegance
skin
rugs
oak
wainscoting
carved
pillars
glowing
ornaments
of
hammered
copper
a
radium
clock
which
must
be
incredibly
old
stood
on
the
stone
mantel
above
a
snapping
fire
a
gun
obviously
of
local
manufacture
hung
over
it
julith
parents
a
plain
quiet
peasant
couple
conducted
him
to
the
end
of
the
wooden
table
while
half
a
dozen
children
watched
him
with
large
eyes
the
younger
children
were
the
only
terrans
who
seemed
to
find
this
removal
an
adventure
the
meal
was
good
and
plentiful
meat
vegetables
bread
beer
milk
ice
cream
coffee
all
of
it
from
the
farms
hereabouts
there
much
trade
between
the
few
thousand
communities
of
earth
they
were
practically
the
company
ate
in
silence
as
was
the
custom
here
when
they
were
finished
jorun
wanted
to
go
but
it
would
have
been
rude
to
leave
immediately
he
went
over
to
a
chair
by
the
fireplace
across
from
the
one
in
which
kormt
sprawled
the
old
man
took
out
a
pipe
and
began
stuffing
it
shadows
wove
across
his
seamed
brown
face
his
eyes
were
a
gleam
out
of
darkness
i
go
down
to
city
hall
with
you
soon
he
said
i
imagine
that
where
the
work
is
going
on
yes
said
jorun
i
can
relieve
zarek
at
it
i
appreciate
it
if
you
did
come
good
sir
your
influence
is
very
steadying
on
these
people
it
should
be
said
kormt
i
been
their
speaker
for
almost
a
hundred
years
and
my
father
gerlaug
was
before
me
and
his
father
kormt
was
before
him
he
took
a
brand
from
the
fire
and
held
it
over
his
pipe
puffing
hard
looking
up
at
jorun
through
tangled
brows
who
was
your
why
i
do
know
i
imagine
he
still
alive
somewhere
but
i
thought
so
no
marriage
no
family
no
home
no
tradition
kormt
shook
his
massive
head
slowly
i
pity
you
galactics
now
please
good
sir
damn
it
all
the
old
clodhopper
could
get
as
irritating
as
a
faulty
computer
we
have
records
that
go
back
to
before
man
left
this
planet
records
of
everything
it
is
you
who
have
forgotten
kormt
smiled
and
puffed
blue
clouds
at
him
that
not
what
i
meant
do
you
mean
you
think
it
is
good
for
men
to
live
a
life
that
is
unchanging
that
is
just
the
same
from
century
to
century
no
new
dreams
no
new
triumphs
always
the
same
grubbing
rounds
of
days
i
can
not
agree
jorun
mind
flickered
over
history
trying
to
evaluate
the
basic
motivations
of
his
opponent
partly
cultural
partly
biological
that
must
be
it
once
terra
had
been
the
center
of
the
civilized
universe
but
the
long
migration
starward
especially
after
the
fall
of
the
first
empire
drained
off
the
most
venturesome
elements
of
the
population
that
drain
went
on
for
thousands
of
years
sol
was
backward
ruined
and
impoverished
by
the
remorseless
price
of
empire
helpless
before
the
storms
of
barbarian
conquest
that
swept
back
and
forth
between
the
stars
even
after
peace
was
restored
there
was
nothing
to
hold
a
young
man
or
woman
of
vitality
and
imagination
here
not
when
you
could
go
toward
galactic
center
and
join
the
new
civilization
building
out
there
came
ever
less
frequently
to
sol
old
machines
rusted
away
and
were
not
replaced
best
to
get
out
while
there
was
still
time
eventually
there
was
a
fixed
psychosomatic
type
one
which
lived
close
to
the
land
in
primitive
changeless
communities
and
isolated
farmsteads
a
type
content
to
gain
its
simple
needs
by
the
labor
of
hand
horse
or
an
occasional
battered
engine
a
culture
grew
up
which
increased
that
rigidity
so
few
had
visited
earth
in
the
last
several
thousand
years
perhaps
one
outsider
a
century
stopping
briefly
off
on
his
way
to
somewhere
else
that
there
was
no
challenge
or
encouragement
to
alter
the
terrans
did
more
people
more
machines
more
anything
they
wished
only
to
remain
as
they
were
you
could
call
them
stagnant
their
life
was
too
healthy
their
civilization
too
rich
in
its
own
way
folk
art
folk
music
ceremony
religion
the
intimacy
of
family
life
which
the
galactics
had
lost
for
that
term
but
to
one
who
flew
between
the
streaming
suns
it
was
a
small
existence
kormt
voice
broke
in
on
his
reverie
dreams
triumphs
work
deeds
love
and
life
and
finally
death
and
the
long
sleep
in
the
earth
he
said
why
should
we
want
to
change
them
they
never
grow
old
they
are
new
for
each
child
that
is
born
well
said
jorun
and
stopped
you
could
really
answer
that
kind
of
logic
it
was
logic
at
all
but
something
deeper
well
he
started
over
after
a
while
as
you
know
this
evacuation
was
forced
on
us
too
we
do
want
to
move
you
but
we
must
oh
yes
said
kormt
you
have
been
very
nice
about
it
it
would
have
been
easier
in
a
way
if
you
come
with
fire
and
gun
and
chains
for
us
like
the
barbarians
did
long
ago
we
could
have
understood
you
better
then
at
best
it
will
be
hard
for
your
people
said
jorun
it
will
be
a
shock
and
they
need
leaders
to
guide
them
through
it
you
have
a
duty
to
help
them
out
there
good
sir
maybe
kormt
blew
a
series
of
smoke
rings
at
his
youngest
descendant
three
years
old
who
crowed
with
laughter
and
climbed
up
on
his
knee
but
they
manage
you
ca
seem
to
realize
said
jorun
that
you
are
the
man
on
who
refuses
to
go
you
will
be
for
the
rest
of
your
life
we
could
come
back
for
you
later
under
any
circumstances
because
there
be
hulduvian
colonies
between
sol
and
sagittarius
which
we
would
disturb
in
passage
you
be
alone
i
say
kormt
shrugged
i
too
old
to
change
my
ways
there
ca
be
many
years
left
me
anyway
i
can
live
well
just
off
the
be
left
here
he
ruffled
the
child
hair
but
his
face
drew
into
a
scowl
now
no
more
of
that
good
sir
if
you
please
i
tired
of
this
argument
jorun
nodded
and
fell
into
the
silence
that
held
the
rest
terrans
would
sometimes
sit
for
hours
without
talking
content
to
be
in
each
nearness
he
thought
of
kormt
gerlaug
son
last
man
on
earth
altogether
alone
living
alone
and
dying
alone
and
yet
he
reflected
was
that
solitude
any
greater
than
the
one
in
which
all
men
dwelt
all
their
days
presently
the
speaker
set
the
child
down
knocked
out
his
pipe
and
rose
come
good
sir
he
said
reaching
for
his
staff
let
us
go
they
walked
side
by
side
down
the
street
under
the
dim
lamps
and
past
the
yellow
windows
the
cobbles
gave
back
their
footfalls
in
a
dull
clatter
once
in
a
while
they
passed
someone
else
a
vague
figure
which
bowed
to
kormt
only
one
did
not
notice
them
an
old
woman
who
walked
crying
between
the
high
walls
they
say
it
is
never
night
on
your
worlds
said
kormt
jorun
threw
him
a
sidelong
glance
his
face
was
a
strong
jutting
of
highlights
from
sliding
shadow
some
planets
have
been
given
luminous
skies
said
the
technician
and
a
few
still
have
cities
too
where
it
is
always
light
but
when
every
man
can
control
the
cosmic
energies
there
is
no
real
reason
for
us
to
live
together
most
of
us
dwell
far
apart
there
are
very
dark
nights
on
my
own
world
and
i
can
not
see
any
other
home
from
my
own
just
the
moors
it
must
be
a
strange
life
said
kormt
belonging
to
no
one
they
came
out
on
the
a
broad
paved
space
walled
in
by
houses
there
was
a
fountain
in
its
middle
and
a
statue
dug
out
of
the
ruins
had
been
placed
there
it
was
broken
one
arm
gone
but
still
the
white
slim
figure
of
the
dancing
girl
stood
with
youth
and
laughter
forever
under
the
sky
of
earth
jorun
knew
that
lovers
were
wont
to
meet
here
and
briefly
irrationally
he
wondered
how
lonely
the
girl
would
be
in
all
the
millions
of
years
to
come
the
city
hall
lay
at
the
farther
end
of
the
square
big
and
dark
its
eaves
carved
with
dragons
and
the
gables
topped
with
birds
it
was
an
old
building
nobody
knew
how
many
generations
of
men
had
gathered
here
a
long
patient
line
of
folk
stood
outside
it
shuffling
in
one
by
one
to
the
registry
desk
emerging
they
went
off
quietly
into
the
darkness
toward
the
temporary
shelters
erected
for
them
walking
by
the
line
jorun
picked
faces
out
of
the
shadows
there
was
a
young
mother
holding
a
crying
child
her
head
bent
over
it
in
a
timeless
pose
murmuring
to
soothe
it
there
was
a
mechanic
still
sooty
from
his
work
smiling
wearily
at
some
tired
joke
of
the
man
behind
him
there
was
a
scowling
peasant
who
muttered
a
curse
as
jorun
went
by
the
rest
seemed
to
accept
their
fate
meekly
enough
there
was
a
priest
his
head
bowed
alone
with
his
god
there
was
a
younger
man
his
hands
clenching
and
unclenching
big
helpless
hands
and
jorun
heard
him
saying
to
someone
else
if
they
could
have
waited
till
after
harvest
i
hate
to
let
good
grain
stand
in
the
field
jorun
went
into
the
main
room
toward
the
desk
at
the
head
of
the
line
hulking
hairless
zarek
was
patiently
questioning
each
of
the
hundreds
who
came
hat
in
hand
before
him
name
age
sex
occupation
dependents
special
needs
or
desires
he
punches
the
answers
out
on
the
recorder
machine
half
a
million
lives
were
held
in
its
electronic
memory
oh
there
you
are
his
bass
rumbled
where
you
been
i
had
to
do
some
concy
work
said
jorun
that
was
a
private
code
term
among
others
concy
conciliation
anything
to
make
the
evacuation
go
smoothly
sorry
to
be
so
late
i
take
over
now
all
right
i
think
we
can
wind
the
whole
thing
up
by
midnight
zarek
smiled
at
kormt
glad
you
came
good
sir
there
are
a
few
people
like
you
to
talk
to
he
gestured
at
half
a
dozen
seated
in
the
rear
of
the
room
certain
complaints
were
best
handled
by
native
leaders
kormt
nodded
and
strode
over
to
the
folk
jorun
heard
a
man
begin
some
explanation
he
wanted
to
take
his
own
plow
along
he
made
it
himself
and
there
was
no
better
plow
in
the
universe
but
the
said
there
would
be
room
they
furnish
us
with
all
the
stuff
we
need
son
said
kormt
but
it
plow
said
the
man
his
fingers
twisted
his
cap
kormt
sat
down
and
began
soothing
him
the
head
of
the
line
waited
a
few
meters
off
while
jorun
took
place
been
a
long
grind
said
the
latter
about
done
now
though
and
will
i
be
glad
to
see
the
last
of
this
planet
i
do
know
said
jorun
it
a
lovely
world
i
do
think
ever
seen
a
more
beautiful
one
zarek
snorted
me
for
thonnvar
i
ca
wait
to
sit
on
the
terrace
by
the
scarlet
sea
and
red
grass
all
around
a
glass
of
oehl
in
my
hand
and
the
crystal
geysers
in
front
of
me
you
a
funny
one
jorun
the
fulkhisian
shrugged
slender
shoulders
zarek
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
went
out
for
supper
and
sleep
jorun
beckoned
to
the
next
terran
and
settled
down
to
the
long
almost
mindless
routine
of
registration
he
was
interrupted
once
by
kormt
who
yawned
mightily
and
bade
him
goodnight
otherwise
it
was
a
steady
interval
in
which
one
anonymous
face
after
another
passed
by
he
was
dimly
surprised
when
the
last
one
came
up
this
was
a
plump
cheerful
fellow
with
small
shrewd
eyes
a
little
more
colorfully
dressed
than
the
others
he
gave
his
occupation
as
merchant
a
minor
tradesman
he
explained
dealing
in
the
little
things
it
was
more
convenient
for
the
peasants
to
buy
than
to
manufacture
themselves
i
hope
you
have
been
waiting
too
long
said
jorun
concy
statement
oh
no
the
merchant
grinned
i
knew
those
dumb
farmers
would
be
here
for
hours
so
i
just
went
to
bed
and
got
up
half
an
hour
ago
when
it
was
about
over
clever
jorun
rose
sighed
and
stretched
the
big
room
was
cavernously
empty
its
lights
a
harsh
glare
it
was
very
quiet
here
well
sir
i
a
middling
smart
chap
if
i
say
it
as
should
and
you
know
i
like
to
express
my
appreciation
of
all
you
doing
for
us
ca
say
we
doing
much
jorun
locked
the
machine
oh
the
may
not
like
it
but
really
good
sir
this
has
been
any
place
for
a
man
of
enterprise
it
dead
i
have
got
out
long
ago
if
there
been
any
transportation
now
when
we
getting
back
into
civilization
there
be
some
real
opportunities
i
make
my
pile
inside
of
five
years
you
bet
jorun
smiled
but
there
was
a
bleakness
in
him
what
chance
would
this
barbarian
have
even
to
get
near
the
gigantic
work
of
civilization
let
alone
comprehend
it
or
take
part
in
it
he
hoped
the
little
fellow
would
break
his
heart
trying
well
he
said
goodnight
and
good
luck
to
you
goodnight
sir
we
meet
again
i
trust
jorun
switched
off
the
lights
and
went
out
into
the
square
it
was
completely
deserted
the
moon
was
up
now
almost
full
and
its
cold
radiance
dimmed
the
lamps
he
heard
a
dog
howling
far
off
the
dogs
of
earth
such
as
were
taken
along
would
be
lonely
too
he
thought
job
over
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
the
ships
he
felt
very
tired
but
did
want
to
sleep
and
willed
himself
back
to
alertness
there
had
been
much
chance
to
inspect
the
ruins
and
he
felt
it
would
be
appropriate
to
see
them
by
moonlight
rising
into
the
air
he
ghosted
above
roofs
and
trees
until
he
came
to
the
dead
city
for
a
while
he
hovered
in
a
sky
like
dark
velvet
a
faint
breeze
murmured
around
him
and
he
heard
the
remote
noise
of
crickets
and
the
sea
but
stillness
enveloped
it
all
there
was
no
real
sound
sol
city
capital
of
the
legendary
first
empire
had
been
enormous
it
must
have
sprawled
over
forty
or
fifty
thousand
square
kilometers
when
it
was
in
its
prime
when
it
was
the
gay
and
wicked
heart
of
human
civilization
and
swollen
with
the
lifeblood
of
the
stars
and
yet
those
who
built
it
had
been
men
of
taste
they
had
sought
out
genius
to
create
for
them
the
city
was
not
a
collection
of
buildings
it
was
a
balanced
whole
radiating
from
the
mighty
peaks
of
the
central
palace
through
colonnades
and
parks
and
leaping
skyways
out
to
the
villas
of
the
rulers
for
all
its
monstrous
size
it
had
been
a
fairy
sight
a
woven
lace
of
polished
metal
and
white
black
red
stone
colored
plastic
music
and
light
everywhere
light
bombarded
from
space
sacked
again
and
again
by
the
barbarian
hordes
who
swarmed
through
the
bones
of
the
slain
empire
weathered
shaken
by
the
slow
sliding
of
earth
crust
pried
apart
by
patient
delicate
roots
dug
over
by
hundreds
of
generations
of
archaeologists
the
idly
curious
made
a
quarry
of
metal
and
stone
for
the
ignorant
peasants
who
finally
huddled
about
it
still
its
empty
walls
and
blind
windows
crumbling
arches
and
toppled
pillars
held
a
ghost
of
beauty
and
magnificence
which
was
like
a
dream
a
dream
the
whole
race
had
once
had
now
we
waking
jorun
moved
silently
over
the
ruins
trees
growing
between
tumbled
blocks
dappled
them
with
moonlight
and
shadow
the
marble
was
very
white
and
fair
against
darkness
he
hovered
by
a
broken
caryatid
marveling
at
its
exquisite
leaping
litheness
that
girl
had
borne
tons
of
stone
like
a
flower
in
her
hair
further
on
across
a
street
that
was
a
lane
of
woods
beyond
a
park
that
was
thick
with
forest
lay
the
nearly
complete
outline
of
a
house
only
its
walls
stood
but
he
could
trace
the
separate
rooms
here
a
noble
had
entertained
his
friends
robes
that
were
fluid
rainbows
jewels
dripping
fire
swift
cynical
interplay
of
wits
like
sharpened
swords
rising
above
music
and
the
clear
sweet
laughter
of
here
people
whose
flesh
was
now
dust
had
slept
and
made
love
and
lain
in
darkness
to
watch
the
moving
pageant
of
the
city
here
the
slaves
had
lived
and
worked
and
sometimes
wept
here
the
children
had
played
their
ageless
games
under
willows
between
banks
of
roses
oh
it
had
been
a
hard
and
cruel
time
it
was
well
gone
but
it
had
lived
it
had
embodied
man
all
that
was
noble
and
splendid
and
evil
and
merely
wistful
in
the
race
and
now
its
late
children
had
forgotten
a
cat
sprang
up
on
one
of
the
walls
and
flowed
noiselessly
along
it
hunting
jorun
shook
himself
and
flew
toward
the
center
of
the
city
the
imperial
palace
an
owl
hooted
somewhere
and
a
bat
fluttered
out
of
his
way
like
a
small
damned
soul
blackened
by
hellfire
he
did
raise
a
but
let
the
air
blow
around
him
the
air
of
earth
the
palace
was
almost
completely
wrecked
a
mountain
of
heaped
rocks
bare
bones
of
eternal
metal
gnawed
thin
by
steady
ages
of
wind
and
rain
and
frost
but
once
it
must
have
been
gigantic
men
rarely
built
that
big
nowadays
they
did
need
to
and
the
whole
human
spirit
had
changed
become
ever
more
abstract
finding
its
treasures
within
itself
but
there
had
been
an
elemental
magnificence
about
early
man
and
the
works
he
raised
to
challenge
the
sky
one
tower
still
stood
a
gutted
shell
white
under
the
stars
rising
in
a
filigree
of
columns
and
arches
which
seemed
impossibly
airy
as
if
it
were
built
of
moonlight
jorun
settled
on
its
broken
upper
balcony
dizzily
high
above
the
fantasy
of
the
ruins
a
hawk
flew
shrieking
from
its
nest
then
there
was
silence
no
wait
another
yell
ringing
down
the
star
ways
a
dark
streak
across
the
moon
face
jorun
recognized
the
joyful
shout
of
young
cluthe
rushing
through
heaven
like
a
demon
on
a
broomstick
and
scowled
in
annoyance
he
did
want
to
be
bothered
now
well
they
had
as
much
right
here
as
he
he
repressed
the
emotion
and
even
managed
a
smile
after
all
he
would
have
liked
to
feel
gay
and
reckless
at
times
but
he
had
never
been
able
to
jorun
was
little
older
than
cluthe
a
few
centuries
at
most
but
he
came
of
a
melancholy
folk
he
had
been
born
old
another
form
pursued
the
first
as
they
neared
jorun
recognized
taliuvenna
supple
outline
those
two
had
been
teamed
up
for
one
of
the
african
districts
but
they
sensed
him
and
came
wildly
out
of
the
sky
to
perch
on
the
balcony
railing
and
swing
their
legs
above
the
heights
how
you
asked
cluthe
his
lean
face
laughed
in
the
moonlight
what
a
flight
i
all
right
said
jorun
you
through
in
your
sector
so
we
thought
we
just
duck
over
and
look
in
here
last
chance
anyone
ever
have
to
do
some
on
earth
taliuvenna
full
lips
drooped
a
bit
as
she
looked
over
the
ruins
she
came
from
yunith
one
of
the
few
planets
where
they
still
kept
cities
and
was
as
much
a
child
of
their
soaring
arrogance
as
jorun
of
his
hills
and
tundras
and
great
empty
seas
i
thought
it
would
be
bigger
she
said
well
they
were
building
this
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
years
ago
said
cluthe
ca
expect
too
much
there
is
good
art
left
here
said
jorun
pieces
which
for
one
reason
or
another
were
carried
off
but
you
have
to
look
around
for
it
i
seen
a
lot
of
it
already
in
museums
said
taliuvenna
not
bad
tally
cried
cluthe
he
touched
her
shoulder
and
sprang
into
the
air
tag
you
it
she
screamed
with
laughter
and
shot
off
after
him
they
rushed
across
the
wilderness
weaving
in
and
out
of
empty
windows
and
broken
colonnades
and
their
shouts
woke
a
clamor
of
echoes
jorun
sighed
better
go
to
he
thought
the
spaceship
was
a
steely
pillar
against
a
low
gray
sky
now
and
then
a
fine
rain
would
drizzle
down
blurring
it
from
sight
then
that
would
end
and
the
ship
flanks
would
glisten
as
if
they
were
polished
clouds
scudded
overhead
like
flying
smoke
and
the
wind
was
loud
in
the
trees
the
line
of
terrans
moving
slowly
into
the
vessel
seemed
to
go
on
forever
a
couple
of
the
ship
crew
flew
above
them
throwing
out
a
shield
against
the
rain
they
shuffled
without
much
talk
or
expression
pushing
carts
filled
with
their
little
possessions
jorun
stood
to
one
side
watching
them
go
by
one
face
after
another
scored
and
darkened
by
the
sun
of
earth
the
winds
of
earth
hands
still
grimy
with
the
soil
of
earth
he
thought
they
go
they
are
being
as
emotional
about
it
as
i
thought
they
would
i
wonder
if
they
really
do
julith
went
past
with
her
parents
she
saw
him
and
darted
from
the
line
and
curtsied
before
him
goodbye
good
sir
she
said
looking
up
she
showed
him
a
small
and
serious
face
will
i
ever
see
you
again
well
he
lied
i
might
look
in
on
you
sometime
please
do
in
a
few
years
maybe
when
you
can
takes
many
generations
to
raise
a
people
like
this
to
our
standard
in
a
few
years
to
me
she
be
in
her
i
sure
you
be
very
happy
he
said
she
gulped
yes
she
said
so
low
he
could
barely
hear
her
yes
i
know
i
will
she
turned
and
ran
back
to
her
mother
the
raindrops
glistened
in
her
hair
zarek
came
up
behind
jorun
i
made
a
sweep
of
the
whole
area
he
said
detected
no
sign
of
human
life
so
it
all
taken
care
of
except
your
old
man
good
said
jorun
tonelessly
i
wish
you
could
do
something
about
him
so
do
i
zarek
strolled
off
again
a
young
man
and
woman
walking
hand
in
hand
turned
out
of
the
line
not
far
away
and
stood
for
a
little
while
a
spaceman
zoomed
over
to
them
better
get
back
he
warned
you
get
rained
on
that
what
we
wanted
said
the
young
man
the
spaceman
shrugged
and
resumed
his
hovering
presently
the
couple
the
line
the
tail
of
the
procession
went
by
jorun
and
the
ship
swallowed
it
fast
the
rain
fell
harder
bouncing
off
his
like
silver
spears
lightning
winked
in
the
west
and
he
heard
the
distant
exuberance
of
thunder
kormt
came
walking
slowly
toward
him
rain
streamed
off
his
clothes
and
matted
his
long
gray
hair
and
beard
his
wooden
shoes
made
a
wet
sound
in
the
mud
jorun
extended
the
to
cover
him
i
hope
changed
your
mind
said
the
fulkhisian
no
i
have
said
kormt
i
just
stayed
away
till
everybody
was
aboard
do
like
goodbyes
you
do
know
what
you
doing
said
jorun
for
the
thousandth
time
it
plain
madness
to
stay
here
alone
i
told
you
i
do
like
goodbyes
said
kormt
harshly
i
have
to
go
advise
the
captain
of
the
ship
said
jorun
you
have
maybe
half
an
hour
before
she
lifts
nobody
will
laugh
at
you
for
changing
your
mind
i
wo
kormt
smiled
without
warmth
you
people
are
the
future
i
guess
why
ca
you
leave
the
past
alone
i
the
past
he
looked
toward
the
far
hills
hidden
by
the
noisy
rain
i
like
it
here
galactic
that
should
be
enough
for
you
well
then
jorun
held
out
his
hand
in
the
archaic
gesture
of
earth
goodbye
goodbye
kormt
took
the
hand
with
a
brief
indifferent
clasp
then
he
turned
and
walked
off
toward
the
village
jorun
watched
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
the
technician
paused
in
the
door
looking
over
the
gray
landscape
and
the
village
from
whose
chimneys
no
smoke
rose
my
he
thought
and
then
surprising
himself
kormt
is
doing
the
right
thing
after
he
entered
the
ship
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
toward
evening
the
clouds
lifted
and
the
sky
showed
a
clear
pale
blue
as
if
it
had
been
washed
clean
and
the
grass
and
leaves
glistened
kormt
came
out
of
the
house
to
watch
the
sunset
it
was
a
good
one
all
flame
and
gold
a
pity
little
julith
was
here
to
see
it
she
always
liked
sunsets
but
julith
was
so
far
away
now
that
if
she
sent
a
call
to
him
calling
with
the
speed
of
light
it
would
not
come
before
he
was
dead
nothing
would
come
to
him
not
ever
again
he
tamped
his
pipe
with
a
horny
thumb
and
lit
it
and
drew
a
deep
cloud
into
his
lungs
hands
in
pockets
he
strolled
down
the
wet
streets
the
sound
of
his
clogs
was
unexpectedly
loud
he
thought
you
got
a
whole
world
all
to
yourself
to
do
with
just
as
you
like
you
the
richest
man
who
ever
there
was
no
problem
in
keeping
alive
enough
food
of
all
kinds
was
stored
in
the
town
to
support
a
hundred
men
for
the
ten
or
twenty
years
remaining
to
him
but
he
want
to
stay
busy
he
could
maybe
keep
three
farms
from
going
to
seed
watch
over
fields
and
orchards
and
livestock
repair
the
buildings
dust
and
wash
and
light
up
in
the
evening
a
man
ought
to
keep
busy
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
street
where
it
turned
into
a
graveled
road
winding
up
toward
a
high
hill
and
followed
that
dusk
was
creeping
over
the
fields
the
sea
was
a
metal
streak
very
far
away
and
a
few
early
stars
blinked
forth
a
wind
was
springing
up
a
soft
murmurous
wind
that
talked
in
the
trees
but
how
quiet
things
were
on
top
of
the
hill
stood
the
chapel
a
small
steepled
building
of
ancient
stone
he
let
himself
in
the
gate
and
walked
around
to
the
graveyard
behind
there
were
many
of
the
demure
white
tombstones
thousands
of
years
of
solis
township
men
and
women
who
had
lived
and
worked
and
begotten
laughed
and
wept
and
died
someone
had
put
a
wreath
on
one
grave
only
this
morning
it
brushed
against
his
leg
as
he
went
by
tomorrow
it
would
be
withered
and
weeds
would
start
to
grow
he
have
to
tend
the
chapel
yard
too
only
fitting
he
found
his
family
plot
and
stood
with
feet
spread
apart
fists
on
hips
smoking
and
looking
down
at
the
markers
gerlaug
kormt
son
tarna
huwan
daughter
these
hundred
years
had
they
lain
in
the
earth
hello
dad
hello
mother
his
fingers
reached
out
and
stroked
the
headstone
of
his
wife
and
so
many
of
his
children
were
here
too
sometimes
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
tall
gerlaug
and
laughing
stamm
and
shy
gentle
huwan
were
gone
he
outlived
too
many
people
had
to
he
thought
is
my
land
i
am
of
it
and
i
go
someone
had
to
stay
and
keep
the
land
if
only
for
a
little
while
i
can
give
it
ten
more
years
before
the
forest
comes
and
takes
darkness
grew
around
him
the
woods
beyond
the
hill
loomed
like
a
wall
once
he
started
violently
he
thought
he
heard
a
child
crying
no
only
a
bird
he
cursed
himself
for
the
senseless
pounding
of
his
heart
place
he
thought
get
back
to
the
he
groped
slowly
out
of
the
yard
toward
the
road
the
stars
were
out
now
kormt
looked
up
and
thought
he
had
never
seen
them
so
bright
too
bright
he
did
like
it
away
he
thought
took
my
people
but
i
staying
here
this
is
my
he
reached
down
to
touch
it
but
the
grass
was
cold
and
wet
under
his
palm
the
gravel
scrunched
loudly
as
he
walked
and
the
wind
mumbled
in
the
hedges
but
there
was
no
other
sound
not
a
voice
called
not
an
engine
turned
not
a
dog
barked
no
he
had
thought
it
would
be
so
quiet
and
dark
no
lights
have
to
tend
the
street
lamps
himself
it
was
no
fun
not
being
able
to
see
the
town
from
here
not
being
able
to
see
anything
except
the
stars
should
have
remembered
to
bring
a
flashlight
but
he
was
old
and
absentminded
and
there
was
no
one
to
remind
him
when
he
died
there
would
be
no
one
to
hold
his
hands
no
one
to
close
his
eyes
and
lay
him
in
the
earth
and
the
forests
would
grow
in
over
the
land
and
wild
beasts
would
nuzzle
his
bones
i
knew
that
what
of
it
i
tough
enough
to
take
the
stars
flashed
and
flashed
above
him
looking
up
against
his
own
will
kormt
saw
how
bright
they
were
how
bright
and
quiet
and
how
very
far
away
he
was
seeing
light
that
had
left
its
home
before
he
was
born
he
stopped
sucking
in
his
breath
between
his
teeth
no
he
whispered
this
was
his
land
this
was
earth
the
home
of
man
it
was
his
and
he
was
its
this
was
the
and
not
a
single
crazily
reeling
and
spinning
through
an
endlessness
of
dark
and
silence
cold
and
immensity
earth
could
not
be
so
alone
last
man
alive
the
last
man
in
all
the
world
he
screamed
then
and
began
to
run
his
feet
clattered
loud
on
the
road
the
small
sound
was
quickly
swallowed
by
silence
and
he
covered
his
face
against
the
relentless
blaze
of
the
stars
but
there
was
no
place
to
run
to
no
place
at
all
