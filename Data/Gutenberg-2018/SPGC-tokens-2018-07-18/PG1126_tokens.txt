there

a
kind
of
character
in
thy
life
that
to
th

doth
thy

fully
unfold
thyself
and
thy
belongings
are
not
thine

so
proper
as
to
waste
thyself
upon
thy
virtues
they
on
thee
heaven
doth
with
us
as
we
with
torches
do
not
light
them
for
themselves
for
if
our
virtues
did
not
go
forth
of
us
all
alike
as
if
we
had
them
not
spirits
are
not
finely
but
to
fine
issues
nor
nature
never
lends
the
smallest
scruple
of
her
excellence
but
like
a
thrifty
goddess
she
determines
herself
the
glory
of
a
creditor
both
thanks
and
use
but
i
do
bend
my
speech
to
one
that
can
my

with
most
painful
feeling
of
thy
speech

but
whilst

hollow
thy
bones
are
hollow
impiety
has
made
a
feast
of
thee
first
gentleman
how
now
which
of
your
hips
has
the
most
profound
sciatica
overdone
well
well
there
one
yonder

prison
was
worth
five
thousand
of
you

pray

sir
that
claudio
signior
claudio
first
gentleman

so
i
saw

arrested
saw
him
carried
away
and
which
is
more
within
these
three
days
his
head
to
be
chopp
off
lucio
but
after
all
this
fooling
i
would
not
have
it
so
art
thou
sure
of
this
overdone
i
am
too
sure
of
it
and
it
is
for
getting
madam
julietta
with
child
lucio
believe
me
this
may
be
he
promis
to
meet
me
two
hours
since
and
he
was
ever
precise
in
second
gentleman
besides
you
know
it
draws
something
near
to
the
speech
we
had
to
such
a
purpose
first
gentleman
but
most
of
all
agreeing
with
the
proclamation
lucio
away
let
go
learn
the
truth
of
it
exeunt
lucio
and
gentlemen
overdone
thus
what
with
the
war
what
with
the
sweat
what
with
the
gallows
and
what
with
poverty
i
am
enter
pompey
how
now
what
the
news
with
you
pompey
yonder
man
is
carried
to
prison
overdone
well
what
has
he
done
pompey
a
woman
overdone
but
what
his
offence
pompey
groping
for
trouts
in
a
peculiar
river
overdone
what
is
there
a
maid
with
child
by
him
pompey
no
but
there
a
woman
with
maid
by
him
you
have
not
heard
of
the
proclamation
have
you
overdone
what
proclamation
man
pompey
all
houses
in
the
suburbs
of
vienna
must
be
down
overdone
and
what
shall
become
of
those
in
the
city
pompey
they
shall
stand
for
seed
they
had
gone
down
too
but
that
a
wise
burgher
put
in
for
them
overdone
but
shall
all
our
houses
of
resort
in
the
suburbs
be
pull
down
pompey
to
the
ground
mistress
overdone
why
here
a
change
indeed
in
the
commonwealth
what
shall
become
of
me
pompey
come
fear
not
you
good
counsellors
lack
no
clients
though
you
change
your
place
you
need
not
change
your
trade
be
your
tapster
still
courage
there
will
be
pity
taken
on
you
you
that
have
worn
your
eyes
almost
out
in
the
service
you
will
be
considered
overdone
what
to
do
here
thomas
tapster
withdraw
pompey
here
comes
signior
claudio
led
by
the
provost
to
prison
and
there
madam
juliet
exeunt
enter
provost
claudio
juliet
and
officers
lucio
following
claudio
fellow
why
dost
thou
show
me
thus
to
th
world
bear
me
to
prison
where
i
am
committed
provost
i
do
it
not
in
evil
disposition
but
from
lord
angelo
by
special
charge
claudio
thus
can
the
demigod
authority
make
us
pay
down
for
our
offence
by
weight
the
words
of
heaven
on
whom
it
will
it
will
on
whom
it
will
not
so
yet
still
is
just
lucio
why
how
now
claudio
whence
comes
this
restraint
claudio
from
too
much
liberty
my
lucio
liberty
as
surfeit
is
the
father
of
much
fast
so
every
scope
by
the
immoderate
use
turns
to
restraint
our
natures
do
pursue
like
rats
that
ravin
down
their
proper
bane
a
thirsty
evil
and
when
we
drink
we
die
lucio
if
i
could
speak
so
wisely
under
an
arrest
i
would
send
for
certain
of
my
creditors
and
yet
to
say
the
truth
i
had
as
lief
have
the
foppery
of
freedom
as
the
morality
of
imprisonment
what
thy
offence
claudio
claudio
what
but
to
speak
of
would
offend
again
lucio
what
murder
claudio
no
lucio
lechery
claudio
call
it
so
provost
away
sir
you
must
go
claudio
one
word
good
friend
lucio
a
word
with
you
lucio
a
hundred
if
they
do
you
any
good
is
lechery
so
after
claudio
thus
stands
it
with
me
upon
a
true
contract
i
got
possession
of
julietta
bed
you
know
the
lady
she
is
fast
my
wife
save
that
we
do
the
denunciation
lack
of
outward
order
this
we
came
not
to
only
for
propagation
of
a
remaining
in
the
coffer
of
her
friends
from
whom
we
thought
it
meet
to
hide
our
love
till
time
had
made
them
for
us
but
it
chances
the
stealth
of
our
most
mutual
entertainment
with
character
too
gross
is
writ
on
juliet
lucio
with
child
perhaps
claudio
unhappily
even
so
and
the
new
deputy
now
for
the
whether
it
be
the
fault
and
glimpse
of
newness
or
whether
that
the
body
public
be
a
horse
whereon
the
governor
doth
ride
who
newly
in
the
seat
that
it
may
know
he
can
command
lets
it
straight
feel
the
spur
whether
the
tyranny
be
in
his
place
or
in
his
eminence
that
fills
it
up
i
stagger
in
but
this
new
governor
awakes
me
all
the
enrolled
penalties
which
have
like
unscour
armour
hung
by
th
wall
so
long
that
nineteen
zodiacs
have
gone
round
and
none
of
them
been
worn
and
for
a
name
now
puts
the
drowsy
and
neglected
act
freshly
on
me
is
surely
for
a
name
lucio
i
warrant
it
is
and
thy
head
stands
so
tickle
on
thy
shoulders
that
a
milkmaid
if
she
be
in
love
may
sigh
it
off
send
after
the
duke
and
appeal
to
him
claudio
i
have
done
so
but
he
not
to
be
found
i
prithee
lucio
do
me
this
kind
service
this
day
my
sister
should
the
cloister
enter
and
there
receive
her
approbation
acquaint
her
with
the
danger
of
my
state
implore
her
in
my
voice
that
she
make
friends
to
the
strict
deputy
bid
herself
assay
him
i
have
great
hope
in
that
for
in
her
youth
there
is
a
prone
and
speechless
dialect
such
as
move
men
beside
she
hath
prosperous
art
when
she
will
play
with
reason
and
discourse
and
well
she
can
persuade
lucio
i
pray
she
may
as
well
for
the
encouragement
of
the
like
which
else
would
stand
under
grievous
imposition
as
for
the
enjoying
of
thy
life
who
i
would
be
sorry
should
be
thus
foolishly
lost
at
a
game
of
i
to
her
claudio
i
thank
you
good
friend
lucio
lucio
within
two
hours
claudio
come
officer
away
exeunt
scene
iii
a
monastery
enter
duke
and
friar
thomas
duke
no
holy
father
throw
away
that
thought
believe
not
that
the
dribbling
dart
of
love
can
pierce
a
complete
bosom
why
i
desire
thee
to
give
me
secret
harbour
hath
a
purpose
more
grave
and
wrinkled
than
the
aims
and
ends
of
burning
youth
friar
may
your
grace
speak
of
it
duke
my
holy
sir
none
better
knows
than
you
how
i
have
ever
lov
the
life
removed
and
held
in
idle
price
to
haunt
assemblies
where
youth
and
cost
a
witless
bravery
keeps
i
have
deliver
to
lord
angelo
a
man
of
stricture
and
firm
abstinence
my
absolute
power
and
place
here
in
vienna
and
he
supposes
me
travell
to
poland
for
so
i
have
strew
it
in
the
common
ear
and
so
it
is
received
now
pious
sir
you
will
demand
of
me
why
i
do
this
friar
gladly
my
lord
duke
we
have
strict
statutes
and
most
biting
laws
the
needful
bits
and
curbs
to
headstrong
steeds
which
for
this
fourteen
years
we
have
let
slip
even
like
an
lion
in
a
cave
that
goes
not
out
to
prey
now
as
fond
fathers
having
bound
up
the
twigs
of
birch
only
to
stick
it
in
their
children
sight
for
terror
not
to
use
in
time
the
rod
becomes
more
mock
than
fear
so
our
decrees
dead
to
infliction
to
themselves
are
dead
and
liberty
plucks
justice
by
the
nose
the
baby
beats
the
nurse
and
quite
athwart
goes
all
decorum
friar
it
rested
in
your
grace
to
unloose
this
justice
when
you
pleas
and
it
in
you
more
dreadful
would
have
than
in
lord
angelo
duke
i
do
fear
too
dreadful
sith
was
my
fault
to
give
the
people
scope
be
my
tyranny
to
strike
and
gall
them
for
what
i
bid
them
do
for
we
bid
this
be
done
when
evil
deeds
have
their
permissive
pass
and
not
the
punishment
therefore
indeed
my
father
i
have
on
angelo
impos
the
office
who
may
in
th
ambush
of
my
name
strike
home
and
yet
my
nature
never
in
the
fight
to
do
in
slander
and
to
behold
his
sway
i
will
as
a
brother
of
your
order
visit
both
prince
and
people
therefore
i
prithee
supply
me
with
the
habit
and
instruct
me
how
i
may
formally
in
person
bear
me
like
a
true
friar
moe
reasons
for
this
action
at
our
more
leisure
shall
i
render
you
only
this
one
lord
angelo
is
precise
stands
at
a
guard
with
envy
scarce
confesses
that
his
blood
flows

to
jest
tongue
far
from

with
all
virgins
so
i
hold
you
as
a
thing
enskied
and
sainted
by
your
renouncement
an
immortal
spirit
and
to
be

with
in

apt
affection

marry
her
lucio
this
is
the
point
the
duke
is
very
strangely
gone
from
hence
bore
many
gentlemen
myself
being
one
in
hand
and
hope
of
action
but
we
do
learn
by
those
that
know
the
very
nerves
of
state
his
were
of
an
infinite
distance
from
his
design
upon
his
place
and
with
full
line
of
his
authority
governs
lord
angelo
a
man
whose
blood
is
very
one
who
never
feels
the
wanton
stings
and
motions
of
the
sense
but
doth
rebate
and
blunt
his
natural
edge
with
profits
of
the
mind
study
and
fast
to
give
fear
to
use
and
liberty
which
have
for
long
run
by
the
hideous
law
as
mice
by
hath
pick
out
an
act
under
whose
heavy
sense
your
brother
life
falls
into
forfeit
he
arrests
him
on
it
and
follows
close
the
rigour
of
the
statute
to
make
him
an
example
all
hope
is
gone
unless
you
have
the
grace
by
your
fair
prayer
to
soften
angelo
and
that
my
pith
of
business
you
and
your
poor
brother
isabella
doth
he
so
seek
his
life
lucio
has
censur
him
already
and
as
i
hear
the
provost
hath
a
warrant
for
his
execution
isabella
alas
what
poor
ability
in
me
to
do
him
good
lucio
assay
the
you
have
isabella
my
power
alas
i
doubt
lucio
our
doubts
are
traitors
and
make
us
lose
the
good
we
oft
might
win
by
fearing
to
attempt
go
to
lord
angelo
and
let
him
learn
to
know
when
maidens
sue
men
give
like
gods
but
when
they
weep
and
kneel
all
their
petitions
are
as
freely
theirs
as
they
themselves
would
owe
them
isabella
i
see
what
i
can
do
lucio
but
speedily
isabella
i
will
about
it
straight
no
longer
staying
but
to
give
the
mother
notice
of
my
affair

humbly
thank
you
commend
me
to
my
brother

certain
word
of
my
success

adieu
exeunt

ii
scene
i
a
hall
in
angelo
house
enter
angelo
escalus
a
justice
provost
officers
and
other
attendants
angelo
we
must
not
make
a
scarecrow
of
the
law
setting
it
up
to
fear
the
birds
of
prey
and
let
it
keep
one
shape
till
custom
make
it
their
perch
and
not
their
terror
escalus
ay
but
yet
let
us
be
keen
and
rather
cut
a
little
than
fall
and
bruise
to
death
alas
this
gentleman
whom
i
would
save
had
a
most
noble
father
let
but
your
honour
know
whom
i
believe
to
be
most
strait
in
virtue
that
in
the
working
of
your
own
affections
had
time
coher
with
place
or
place
with
wishing
or
that
the
resolute
acting
of
our
blood
could
have
attain
th
effect
of
your
own
purpose
whether
you
had
not
sometime
in
your
life
err
in
this
point
which
now
you
censure
him
and
pull
the
law
upon
you
angelo
is
one
thing
to
be
tempted
escalus
another
thing
to
fall
i
not
deny
the
jury
passing
on
the
prisoner
life
may
in
the
sworn
twelve
have
a
thief
or
two
guiltier
than
him
they
try
what
open
made
to
justice
that
justice
seizes
what
knows
the
laws
that
thieves
do
pass
on
thieves
is
very
pregnant
the
jewel
that
we
find
we
stoop
and
because
we
see
it
but
what
we
do
not
see
we
tread
upon
and
never
think
of
it
you
may
not
so
extenuate
his
offence
for
i
have
had
such
faults
but
rather
tell
me

that
censure
him
do

give
thee
moving
graces
angelo
condemn
the
fault
and
not
the
actor
of
it
why
every
fault
condemn
ere
it
be
done

were
the
very
cipher
of
a
function
to
fine
the
faults
whose
fine
stands
in
record
and
let
go
by
the
actor
isabella
o
just

entreat
him
kneel

tame
a

desire
it
to
him
i
say
isabella
must
he
needs
die
angelo
maiden
no

do
think
that
you
might
pardon
him
and
neither
heaven
nor
man
grieve
at
the
mercy
angelo
i
will
not
isabella
but
can
you
if
you
would
angelo
look
what
i
will
not
that
i
can
not
do
isabella
but
might
you
and
do
the
world
no
wrong
if
so
your
heart
were
touch
with
that
remorse
as
mine
is
to
him
angelo
he
sentenc
is
too
late
lucio
to

you
are
too
cold
isabella
too
late
why
no
i
that
do
speak
a
word
may
call

well
believe
this
no
ceremony
that
to
great
ones
longs
not
the
king
crown
nor
the
deputed
sword
the
marshal
truncheon
nor
the
judge
robe
become
them
with
one
half
so
good
a
grace
as
mercy
does
if
he
had
been
as
you
and
you
as
he
you
would
have
slipp
like
him
but
he
like
you
would
not
have
been
so
stern
angelo
pray
you
be
gone
isabella
i
would
to

i
had
your
potency

i
would
tell

to
be
a
judge
and
what
a
prisoner
lucio
to
isabella
ay
touch
him
there
the
vein
angelo
your
brother
is
a
forfeit
of
the
law
and
you
but
waste
your
words
isabella
alas
alas
why
all
the
souls
that
were
were
forfeit
once
and
he
that
might
the
vantage
best
have
took
found
out
the
remedy
how
would
you
be
if
he
which
is
the
top
of
judgment
should
but
judge
you
as
you
are
o
think
on
that
and
mercy
then
will
breathe
within
your
lips
like
man
new
made
angelo
be
you
content
fair

it
is
the

condemn
your

were
he
my
kinsman
brother
or
my
son
it
should
be
thus
with
him
he
must
die
isabella
o
that
sudden
spare
him
spare
him
he
not
prepar
for
death
even
for
our
kitchens
we
kill
the
fowl
of
season
shall
we
serve
heaven
with
less
respect
than
we
do
minister
to
our
gross
selves
good
good
my
lord
bethink
you
who
is
it
that
hath
died
for
this
offence
there
many
have
committed
it
lucio
aside
ay
well
said
angelo
the
law
hath
not
been
dead
though
it
hath
slept
those
many
had
not
dar
to
do
that
evil
if
the
first
that
did
th
edict
infringe
had
answer
for
his
deed
now
is
awake
takes
note
of
what
is
done
and
like
a
prophet
looks
in
a
glass
that
shows
what
future
either
now
or
by
remissness
new
conceiv
and
so
in
progress
to
be
hatch
and
are
now
to
have
no
successive
degrees
but
here
they
live
to
end
isabella
yet
show
some
pity
angelo
i
show
it
most
of
all
when
i
show
justice
for
then
i
pity
those
i
do
not
know
which
a
dismiss
offence
would
after
gall
and
do
him
right
that
answering
one
foul
wrong
lives
not
to
act
another
be
satisfied
your
brother
dies
be
content
isabella
so
you
must
be
the
first
that
gives
this
sentence
and
he
that
suffers
o
it
is
excellent
to
have
a
giant
strength
but
it
is
tyrannous
to
use
it
like
a
giant
lucio
to
isabella
that
well
said
isabella
could
great
men
thunder
as
jove
himself
does
jove
would
never
be
quiet
for
every
pelting
petty
officer
would
use
his
heaven
for
thunder
nothing
but
thunder
merciful
heaven
thou
rather
with
thy
sharp
and
sulphurous
bolt
splits

in
a

his

such
fantastic
tricks

not
weigh
our

in
the
less
foul
profanation

that
more
o

why
do
you
put
these
sayings
upon
me
isabella
because

a
kind
of
medicine

even
so
heaven
keep
your
honour
angelo
yet
may
he
live
awhile
and
it
may
be
as
long
as
you
or
i
yet
he
must
die
isabella
under
your
sentence
angelo
yea
isabella
when
i
beseech
you
that
in
his
reprieve
longer
or
shorter
he
may
be
so
fitted
that
his
soul
sicken
not
angelo
ha
fie
these
filthy
vices
it
were
as
good
to
pardon
him
that
hath
from
nature
a
man
already
made
as
to
remit
their
saucy
sweetness
that
do
coin
heaven
image
in
stamps
that
are
forbid
is
all
as
easy
falsely
to
take
away
a
life
true
made
as
to
put
metal
in
restrained
means
to
make
a
false
one
isabella
is
set
down
so
in
heaven
but
not
in
earth
angelo
say
you
so
then
i
shall
pose
you
quickly
which
had
you
that
the
most
just
law
now
took
your
brother
life
or
to
redeem
him
give
up
your
body
to
such
sweet
uncleanness
as
she
that
he
hath
stain
isabella
sir
believe
this
i
had
rather
give
my
body
than
my
soul
angelo
i
talk
not
of
your
soul
our
compell
sins
stand
more
for
number
than
for
accompt
isabella
how
say
you
angelo
nay
i
not
warrant
that
for
i
can
speak
against
the
thing
i
say
answer
to
this
i
now
the
voice
of
the
recorded
law
pronounce
a
sentence
on
your
brother
life
might
there
not
be
a
charity
in
sin
to
save
this
brother
life
isabella
please
you
to
i
take
it
as
a
peril
to
my
soul
it
is
no
sin
at
all
but
charity
angelo
pleas
you
to
at
peril
of
your
soul
were
equal
poise
of
sin
and
charity
isabella
that
i
do
beg
his
life
if
it
be
sin
heaven
let
me
bear
it
you
granting
of
my
suit
if
that
be
sin
i
make
it
my
morn
prayer
to
have
it
added
to
the
faults
of
mine
and
nothing
of
your
answer
angelo
nay
but
hear
me
your
sense
pursues
not
mine
either
you
are
ignorant
or
seem
so
craftily
and
that
not
good
isabella
let
me
be
ignorant
and
in
nothing
good
but
graciously
to
know
i
am
no
better
angelo
thus
wisdom
wishes
to
appear
most
bright
when
it
doth
tax
itself
as
these
black
masks
proclaim
an
enshielded
beauty
ten
times
louder
than
beauty
could
display
but
mark
me
to
be
received
plain
i
speak
more
your
brother
is
to
die
isabella
so
angelo
and
his
offence
is
so
as
it
appears
accountant
to
the
law
upon
that
pain
isabella
true
angelo
admit
no
other
way
to
save
his
life
as
i
subscribe
not
that
nor
any
other
but
in
the
loss
of
question
that
you
his
sister
finding
yourself
desir
of
such
a
person
whose
credit
with
the
judge
or
own
great
place
could
fetch
your
brother
from
the
manacles
of
the
law
and
that
there
were
no
earthly
mean
to
save
him
but
that
either
you
must
lay
down
the
treasures
of
your
body
to
this
supposed
or
else
to
let
him
what
would
you
do
isabella
as
much
for
my
poor
brother
as
myself
that
is
were
i
under
the
terms
of
death
th
impression
of
keen
whips
i
wear
as
rubies
and
strip
myself
to
death
as
to
a
bed
that
longing
have
been
sick
for
ere
i
yield
my
body
up
to
shame
angelo
then
must
your
brother
die
isabella
and
the
cheaper
way
better
it
were
a
brother
died
at
once
than
that
a
sister
by
redeeming
him
should
die
for
ever
angelo
were
not
you
then
as
cruel
as
the
sentence
that
you
have
slander
so
isabella
ignominy
in
ransom
and
free
pardon
are
of
two
houses
lawful
mercy
is
nothing
kin
to
foul
redemption
angelo
you
seem
of
late
to
make
the
law
a
tyrant
and
rather
prov
the
sliding
of
your
brother
a
merriment
than
a
vice
isabella
o
pardon
me
my
lord
it
oft
falls
out
to
have
what
we
would
have
we
speak
not
what
we
mean
i
something
do
excuse
the
thing
i
hate
for
his
advantage
that
i
dearly
love
angelo
we
are
all
frail
isabella
else
let
my
brother
die
if
not
a
fedary
but
only
he
owe
and
succeed
thy
weakness
angelo
nay
women
are
frail
too
isabella
ay
as
the
glasses
where
they
view
themselves
which
are
as
easy
broke
as
they
make
forms
women
help
heaven
men
their
creation
mar
in
profiting
by
them
nay
call
us
ten
times
frail
for
we
are
soft
as
our
complexions
are
and
credulous
to
false
prints
angelo
i
think
it
well
and
from
this
testimony
of
your
own
sex
since
i
suppose
we
are
made
to
be
no
stronger
than
faults
may
shake
our
frames
let
me
be
bold
i
do
arrest
your
words
be
that
you
are
that
is
a
woman
if
you
be
more
you
none
if
you
be
one
as
you
are
well
by
all
external
warrants
show
it
now
by
putting
on
the
destin
livery
isabella
i
have
no
tongue
but
one
gentle
my
lord
let
me
intreat
you
speak
the
former
language
angelo
plainly
conceive
i
love
you
isabella
my
brother
did
love
juliet
and
you
tell
me
that
he
shall
die
angelo
he
shall
not
isabel
if
you
give
me
love
isabella
i
know
your
virtue
hath
a
license
i
which
seems
a
little
fouler
than
it
is
to
pluck
on
others
angelo
believe
me
on
mine
honour
my
words
express
my
purpose
isabella
ha
little
honour
to
be
much
believ
and
most
pernicious
purpose
seeming
seeming
i
will
proclaim
thee
angelo
look
sign
me
a
present
pardon
for
my
brother
or
with
an
outstretch
throat
i
tell
the
world
aloud
what
man
thou
art
angelo
who
will
believe
thee
isabel
my
unsoil
name
th
austereness
of
my
life
my
vouch
against
you
and
my
place
i
th
state
will
so
your
accusation
overweigh
that
you
shall
stifle
in
your
own
report
and
smell
of
calumny
i
have
begun
and
now
i
give
my
sensual
race
the
rein
fit
thy
consent
to
my
sharp
appetite
lay
by
all
nicety
and
prolixious
blushes
that
banish
what
they
sue
for
redeem
thy
brother
by
yielding
up
thy
body
to
my
will
or
else
he
must
not
only
die
the
death
but
thy
unkindness
shall
his
death
draw
out
to
sufferance
answer
me
or
by
the
affection
that
now
guides
me
most
i
prove
a
tyrant
to

as
for
you

what
you
can
my
false
your
true
exit
isabella
to
whom
should
i
complain
did
i
tell

who
would
believe
me
o
perilous
mouths
that
bear
in
them
one
and
the
tongue
either
of
condemnation
or
approof
bidding
the
law
make
curtsy
to
their
will
hooking
both
right
and
wrong
to
th
appetite
to
follow
as
it
draws
i
to
my
brother
though
he
hath
by
prompture
of
the
blood

hath
he
in
him
such
a
mind
of
honour
that
had
he
twenty
heads
to
tender
down
on
twenty
bloody
blocks
he
yield
them
up
before
his
sister
should
her
body
stoop
to
such
abhorr
pollution
then
isabel
live
chaste
and
brother
die
more
than
our

chastity
i
tell

claudio
most
holy
sir
i
thank
you
enter
isabella
isabella
my
business
is
a
word
or
two
with
claudio
provost
and
very
welcome
look
signior
here
your
sister
duke
provost
a
word
with
you
provost
as
many
as
you
please
duke
bring
me
to
hear
them
speak
where
i
may
be
conceal
exeunt
duke
and
provost
claudio
now
sister
what
the
comfort
isabella
why
as
all
comforts
are
most
good
most
good
indeed
lord
angelo
having
affairs
to
heaven
intends
you
for
his
swift
ambassador
where
you
shall
be
an
everlasting
leiger
therefore
your
best
appointment
make
with
speed
you
set
on
claudio
is
there
no
remedy
isabella
none
but
such
remedy
as
to
save
a
head
to
cleave
a
heart
in
twain
claudio
but
is
there
any
isabella
yes
brother
you
may
live
there
is
a
devilish
mercy
in
the
judge
if
you
implore
it
that
will
free
your
life
but
fetter
you
till
death
claudio
perpetual
durance
isabella
ay
just
perpetual
durance
a
restraint
though
all
the
world
vastidity
you
had
to
a
determin
scope
claudio
but
in
what
nature
isabella
in
such
a
one
as
you
consenting
would
bark
your
honour
from
that
trunk
you
bear
and
leave
you
naked
claudio
let
me
know
the
point
isabella
o
i
do
fear
thee
claudio
and
i
quake
lest
thou
a
feverous
life
shouldst
entertain
and
six
or
seven
winters
more
respect
than
a
perpetual
honour
thou
die
the
sense
of
death
is
most
in
apprehension
and
the
poor
beetle
that
we
tread
upon
in
corporal
sufferance
finds
a
pang
as
great
as
when
a
giant
dies
claudio
why
give
you
me
this
shame
think
you
i
can
a
resolution
fetch
from
tenderness
if
i
must
die
i
will
encounter
darkness
as
a
bride
and
hug
it
in
mine
arms
isabella
there
spake
my
brother
there
my
father
grave
did
utter
forth
a
voice
yes
thou
must
die
thou
art
too
noble
to
conserve
a
life
in
base
appliances
this
deputy
whose
settled
visage
and
deliberate
word
nips
youth
i
th
head
and
follies
doth
enew
as
falcon
doth
the
fowl
is
yet
a
devil
his
filth
within
being
cast
he
would
appear
a
pond
as
deep
as
hell
claudio
the
precise
angelo
isabella
o
is
the
cunning
livery
of
hell
the
body
to
invest
and
cover
in
precise
guards
dost
thou
think
claudio
if
i
would
yield
him
my
virginity
thou
mightst
be
freed
claudio
o
heavens
it
can
not
be
isabella
yes
he
would
thee
from
this
rank
offence
so
to
offend
him
still
this
night
the
time
that
i
should
do
what
i
abhor
to
name
or
else
thou
diest
claudio
thou
shalt
not
isabella
o
were
it
but
my
life
i
throw
it
down
for
your
deliverance
as
frankly
as
a
pin
claudio
thanks
dear
isabel
isabella
be
ready
claudio
for
your
death
claudio
yes
has
he
affections
in
him
that
thus
can
make
him
bite
the
law
by
th
nose
when
he
would
force
it
sure
it
is
no
sin
or
of
the
deadly
seven
it
is
the
least
isabella
which
is
the
least
claudio
if
it
were
damnable
he
being
so
wise
why
would
he
for
the
momentary
trick
be
perdurably
fin
o
isabel
isabella
what
says
my
brother
claudio
death
is
a
fearful
thing
isabella
and
shamed
life
a
hateful
claudio
ay
but
to
die
and
go
we
know
not
where
to
lie
in
cold
obstruction
and
to
rot
this
sensible
warm
motion
to
become
a
kneaded
clod
and
the
delighted
spirit
to
bathe
in
fiery
floods
or
to
reside
in
thrilling
region
of
ice
to
be
imprison
in
the
viewless
winds
and
blown
with
restless
violence
round
about
the
pendent
world
or
to
be
worse
than
worst
of
those
that
lawless
and
incertain
thought
imagine
is
too
horrible
the
weariest
and
most
loathed
worldly
life
that
age
ache
penury
and
imprisonment
can
lay
on
nature
is
a
paradise
to
what
we
fear
of
death
isabella
alas
alas
claudio
sweet
sister
let
me
live
what
sin
you
do
to
save
a
brother
life
nature
dispenses
with
the
deed
so
far
that
it
becomes
a
virtue
isabella
o
you
beast
o
faithless
coward
o
dishonest
wretch
wilt
thou
be
made
a
man
out
of
my
vice
not
a
kind
of
incest
to
take
life
from
thine
own
sister
shame
what
should
i
think
heaven
shield
my
mother
play
my
father
fair
for
such
a
warped
slip
of
wilderness
issu
from
his
blood
take
my
defiance
die
perish
might
but
my
bending
down
reprieve
thee
from
thy
fate

should
proceed
i
pray

thousand

what
hath
pass
between

your
sister

never
the
purpose
to
corrupt
her
only
he
hath
made
an
assay
of
her
virtue
to
practise
his
judgment
with
the
disposition
of
natures
she
having
the
truth
of
honour
in
her
hath
made
him
that
gracious
denial
which
he
is
most
glad
to
receive
i
am
confessor
to
angelo
and
i
know
this
to
be
true

my
company
provost
in
good
time
exit
provost
duke
the
hand
that
hath
made
you
fair
hath
made
you
good
the
goodness
that
is
cheap
in
beauty
makes

brief
in
goodness
but

the
soul

assault
that

hath
made

convey
to
my
understanding
and
but
that
frailty
hath
examples
for
his

should
wonder
at
angelo
how
will
you
do
to
content
this
substitute
and
to
save
your
brother
isabella
i
am
now
going
to
resolve
him
i
had
rather
my
brother
die
by
the
law
than
my
son
should
be
unlawfully
born
but
o
how
much
is
the
good
duke
deceiv
in
angelo
if
ever
he
return
and
i
can
speak
to
him
i
will
open
my
lips
in
vain
or
discover
his
government
duke
that
shall
not
be
much
amiss
yet
as
the
matter
now
stands
he
will
avoid
your
accusation
he
made
trial
of
you
only
therefore
fasten
your
ear
on
my
advisings
to
the
love
i
have
in
doing
good
a
remedy
presents
itself
i
do
make
myself
believe
that
you
may
most
uprighteously
do
a
poor
wronged
lady
a
merited
benefit
redeem
your
brother
from
the
angry
law
do
no
stain
to
your
own
gracious
person
and
much
please
the
absent
duke
if
peradventure
he
shall
ever
return
to
have
hearing
of
this
business
isabella
let
me
hear
you
speak
farther
i
have
spirit
to
do
anything
that
appears
not
foul
in
the
truth
of
my
spirit
duke
virtue
is
bold
and
goodness
never
fearful
have
you
not
heard
speak
of
mariana
the
sister
of
frederick
the
great
soldier
who
miscarried
at
sea
isabella
i
have
heard
of
the
lady
and
good
words
went
with
her
name
duke
she
should
this
angelo
have
married
was
affianced
to
her
by
oath
and
the
nuptial
appointed
between
which
time
of
the
contract
and
limit
of
the
solemnity
her
brother
frederick
was
wreck
at
sea
having
in
that
perished
vessel
the
dowry
of
his
sister
but
mark
how
heavily
this
befell
to
the
poor
gentlewoman
there
she
lost
a
noble
and
renowned
brother
in
his
love
toward
her
ever
most
kind
and
natural
with
him
the
portion
and
sinew
of
her
fortune
her
with
both
her
combinate
husband
this
angelo
isabella
can
this
be
so
did
angelo
so
leave
her
duke
left
her
in
her
tears
and
dried
not
one
of
them
with
his
comfort
swallowed
his
vows
whole
pretending
in
her
discoveries
of
dishonour
in
few
bestow
her
on
her
own
lamentation
which
she
yet
wears
for
his
sake
and
he
a
marble
to
her
tears
is
washed
with
them
but
relents
not
isabella
what
a
merit
were
it
in
death
to
take
this
poor
maid
from
the
world
what
corruption
in
this
life
that
it
will
let
this
man
live
but
how
out
of
this
can
she
avail
duke
it
is
a
rupture
that
you
may
easily
heal
and
the
cure
of
it
not
only
saves
your
brother
but
keeps
you
from
dishonour
in
doing
it
isabella
show
me
how
good
father
duke
this
forenamed
maid
hath
yet
in
her
the
continuance
of
her
first
affection
his
unjust
unkindness
that
in
all
reason
should
have
quenched
her
love
hath
like
an
impediment
in
the
current
made
it
more
violent
and
unruly
go
you
to
angelo
answer
his
requiring
with
a
plausible
obedience
agree
with
his
demands
to
the
point
only
refer
yourself
to
this
advantage
first
that
your
stay
with
him
may
not
be
long
that
the
time
may
have
all
shadow
and
silence
in
it
and
the
place
answer
to
convenience
this
being
granted
in
and
now
follows
all
we
shall
advise
this
wronged
maid
to
stead
up
your
appointment
go
in
your
place
if
the
encounter
acknowledge
itself
hereafter
it
may
compel
him
to
her
recompense
and
here
by
this
is
your
brother
saved
your
honour
untainted
the
poor
mariana
advantaged
and
the
corrupt
deputy
scaled

maid
will
i
frame
and
make
fit
for
his
attempt
if
you
think
well
to
carry
this
as
you
may
the
doubleness
of
the
benefit
defends
the
deceit
from
reproof
what
think
you
of
it
isabella
the
image
of
it
gives
me
content
already
and
i
trust
it
will
grow
to
a
most
prosperous
perfection

lies
much
in
your
holding
up

news
friar
of

duke
i
know
none
can
you
tell
me
of
any
lucio
some
say
he
is
with
the
emperor
of
russia
other
some
he
is
in
rome
but
where
is
he
think
you
duke
i
know
not
where
but
wheresoever
i
wish
him
well
lucio
it
was
a
mad
fantastical
trick
of
him
to
steal
from
the
state
and
usurp
the
beggary
he
was
never
born
to
lord
angelo
dukes
it
well
in
his
absence
he
puts
transgression
duke
he
does
well
i
lucio
a
little
more
lenity
to
lechery
would
do
no
harm
in
him
something
too
crabbed
that
way
friar
duke
it
is
too
general
a
vice
and
severity
must
cure
it
lucio
yes
in
good
sooth
the
vice
is
of
a
great
kindred
it
is
well
allied
but
it
is
impossible
to
extirp
it
quite
friar
till
eating
and
drinking
be
put
down
they
say
this
angelo
was
not
made
by
man
and
woman
after
this
downright
way
of
creation
is
it
true
think
you
duke
how
should
he
be
made
then
lucio
some
report
a
spawn
him
some
that
he
was
begot
between
two
but
it
is
certain
that
when
he
makes
water
his
urine
is
congeal
ice
that
i
know
to
be
true
and
he
is
a
motion
generative
that
infallible
duke
you
are
pleasant
sir
and
speak
apace
lucio
why
what
a
ruthless
thing
is
this
in
him
for
the
rebellion
of
a
codpiece
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
would
the
duke
that
is
absent
have
done
this
ere
he
would
have
hang
a
man
for
the
getting
a
hundred
bastards
he
would
have
paid
for
the
nursing
a
thousand
he
had
some
feeling
of
the
sport
he
knew
the
service
and
that
instructed
him
to
mercy
duke
i
never
heard
the
absent
duke
much
detected
for
women
he
was
not
inclin
that
way
lucio
o
sir
you
are
deceiv
duke
is
not
possible
lucio
not
the
duke
yes
your
beggar
of
fifty
and
his
use
was
to
put
a
ducat
in
her
the
duke
had
crotchets
in
him
he
would
be
drunk
too
that
let
me
inform
you
duke
you
do
him
wrong
surely
lucio
sir
i
was
an
inward
of
his
a
shy
fellow
was
the
duke
and
i
believe
i
know
the
cause
of
his
withdrawing
duke
what
i
prithee
might
be
the
cause
lucio
no
pardon
is
a
secret
must
be
lock
within
the
teeth
and
the
lips
but
this
i
can
let
you
understand
the
greater
file
of
the
subject
held
the
duke
to
be
wise
duke
wise
why
no
question
but
he
was
lucio
a
very
superficial
ignorant
unweighing
fellow
duke
either
this
is
envy
in
you
folly
or
mistaking
the
very
stream
of
his
life
and
the
business
he
hath
helmed
must
upon
a
warranted
need
give
him
a
better
proclamation
let
him
be
but
testimonied
in
his
own
and
he
shall
appear
to
the
envious
a
scholar
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
therefore
you
speak
unskilfully
or
if
your
knowledge
be
more
it
is
much
in
your
malice
lucio
sir
i
know
him
and
i
love
him
duke
love
talks
with
better
knowledge
and
knowledge
with
dearer
love
lucio
come
sir
i
know
what
i
know
duke
i
can
hardly
believe
that
since
you
know
not
what
you
speak
but
if
ever
the
duke
return
as
our
prayers
are
he
may
let
me
desire
you
to
make
your
answer
before
him
if
it
be
honest
you
have
spoke
you
have
courage
to
maintain
it
i
am
bound
to
call
upon
you
and
i
pray
you
your
name
lucio
sir
my
name
is
lucio
well
known
to
the
duke
duke
he
shall
know
you
better
sir
if
i
may
live
to
report
you
lucio
i
fear
you
not
duke
o
you
hope
the
duke
will
return
no
more
or
you
imagine
me
too
unhurtful
an
opposite
but
indeed
i
can
do
you
little
harm
you
forswear
this
again
lucio
i
be
hang
first
thou
art
deceiv
in
me
friar
but
no
more
of
this
canst
thou
tell
if
claudio
die
or
no
duke
why
should
he
die
sir
lucio
why
for
filling
a
bottle
with
a
i
would
the
duke
we
talk
of
were
return
again
this
ungenitur
agent
will
unpeople
the
province
with
continency
sparrows
must
not
build
in
his
because
they
are
lecherous
the
duke
yet
would
have
dark
deeds
darkly
answered
he
would
never
bring
them
to
light
would
he
were
return
marry
this
claudio
is
condemned
for
untrussing
farewell
good
friar
i
prithee
pray
for
me
the
duke
i
say
to
thee
again
would
eat
mutton
on
fridays
not
past
it
yet
and
i
say
to
thee
he
would
mouth
with
a
beggar
though
she
smelt
brown
bread
and
garlic
say
that
i
said
so
farewell

enough
alive
to
make
societies
secure
but
security
enough
to
make
fellowships
accurst
much
upon
this
riddle
runs
the
wisdom
of
the
world
this
news
is
old
enough
yet
it
is
every
day
news
i
pray
you
sir
of
what
disposition
was
the
duke
escalus
one
that
above
all
other
strifes
contended
especially
to
know
himself
duke
what
pleasure
was
he
given
to
escalus
rather
rejoicing
to
see
another
merry
than
merry
at
anything
which
profess
to
make
him
rejoice
a
gentleman
of
all
temperance
but
leave
we
him
to
his
events
with
a
prayer
they
may
prove
prosperous
and
let
me
desire
to
know
how
you
find
claudio
prepar
i
am
made
to
understand
that
you
have
lent
him
visitation
duke
he
professes
to
have
received
no
sinister
measure
from
his
judge
but
most
willingly
humbles
himself
to
the
determination
of
justice
yet
had
he
framed
to
himself
by
the
instruction
of
his
frailty
many
deceiving
promises
of
life
which
i
by
my
good
leisure
have
discredited
to
him
and
now
he
is
resolv
to
die
escalus
you
have
paid
the
heavens
your
function
and
the
prisoner
the
very
debt
of
your
calling
i
have
labour
for
the
poor
gentleman
to
the
extremest
shore
of
my
modesty
but
my
brother
justice
have
i
found
so
severe
that
he
hath
forc
me
to
tell
him
he
is
indeed
justice
duke
if
his
own
life
answer
the
straitness
of
his
proceeding
it
shall
become
him
well
wherein
if
he
chance
to
fail
he
hath
sentenc
himself
escalus
i
am
going
to
visit
the
prisoner
fare
you
well
duke
peace
be
with
you
exeunt
escalus
and
provost
he
who
the
sword
of
heaven
will
bear
should
be
as
holy
as
severe
pattern
in
himself
to
know
grace
to
stand
and
virtue
go
more
nor
less
to
others
paying
than
by
weighing
shame
to
him
whose
cruel
striking
kills
for
faults
of
his

liking
twice
treble
shame

better
satisfaction
let

let
this
be
duly
performed
with
a
thought
that

than
we
must
yet
deliver
thus
fail
not
to
do
your
office
as
you
will
answer
it
at
your
peril
what
say
you
to
this
sir
duke
what
is
that
barnardine
who
is
to
be
executed
in
afternoon
provost
a
bohemian
born
but
here
nurs
up
and
bred
one
that
is
a
prisoner
nine
years
old
duke
how
came
it
that
the
absent
duke
had
not
either
him
to
his
liberty
or
executed
him
i
have
heard
it
was
ever
his
manner
to
do
so
provost
his
friends
still
wrought
reprieves
for
him
and
indeed
his
fact
till
now
in
the
government
of
lord
angelo
came
not
to
an
undoubted
proof
duke
it
is
now
apparent
provost
most
manifest
and
not
denied
by
himself
duke
hath
he
borne
himself
penitently
in
prison
how
seems
he
to
be
touch
provost
a
man
that
apprehends
death
no
more
dreadfully
but
as
a
drunken
sleep
careless
reckless
and
fearless
of
past
present
or
to
come
insensible
of
mortality
and
desperately
mortal
duke
he
wants
advice
provost
he
will
hear
none
he
hath
evermore
had
the
liberty
of
the
prison
give
him
leave
to
escape
hence
he
would
not
drunk
many
times
a
day
if
not
many
days
entirely
drunk
we
have
very
oft
awak
him
as
if
to
carry
him
to
execution
and
show
him
a
seeming
warrant
for
it
it
hath
not
moved
him
at
all
duke
more
of
him
anon
there
is
written
in
your
brow
provost
honesty
and
constancy
if
i
read
it
not
truly
my
ancient
skill
beguiles
me
but
in
the
boldness
of
my
cunning
i
will
lay
myself
in
hazard
claudio
whom
here
you
have
warrant
to
execute
is
no
greater
forfeit
to
the
law
than
angelo
who
hath
him
to
make
you
understand
this
in
a
manifested
effect
i
crave
but
four
days
respite
for
the
which
you
are
to
do
me
both
a
present
and
a
dangerous
courtesy
provost
pray
sir
in
what
duke
in
the
delaying
death
provost
alack
how
may
i
do
it
having
the
hour
limited
and
an
express
command
under
penalty
to
deliver
his
head
in
the
view
of
angelo
i
may
make
my
case
as
claudio
to
cross
this
in
the
smallest
duke
by
the
vow
of
mine
order
i
warrant
you
if
my
instructions
may
be
your
guide
let
this
barnardine
be
this
morning
executed
and
his
head
borne
to
angelo
provost
angelo
hath
seen
them
both
and
will
discover
the
favour
duke
o
death
a
great
disguiser
and
you
may
add
to
it
shave
the
head
and
tie
the
beard
and
say
it
was
the
desire
of
the
penitent
to
be
so
bar
before
his
death
you
know
the
course
is
common
if
anything
fall
to
you
upon
this
more
than
thanks
and
good
fortune
by
the
saint
whom
i
profess
i
will
plead
against
it
with
my
life
provost
pardon
me
good
father
it
is
against
my
oath
duke
were
you
sworn
to
the
duke
or
to
the
deputy
provost
to
him
and
to
his
substitutes
duke
you
will
think
you
have
made
no
offence
if
the
duke
avouch
the
justice
of
your
dealing
provost
but
what
likelihood
is
in
that
duke
not
a
resemblance
but
a
certainty
yet
since
i
see
you
fearful
that
neither
my
coat
integrity
nor
persuasion
can
with
ease
attempt
you
i
will
go
further
than
i
meant
to
pluck
all
fears
out
of
you
look
you
sir
here
is
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
duke
you
know
the
character
i
doubt
not
and
the
signet
is
not
strange
to
you
provost
i

uneven

distracted
manner
his
actions
show
much
like

be
not
tainted
and
why
meet
him
at
the
gates
and
redeliver
our
authorities
there
escalus
i
guess
not
angelo
and
why
should
we
proclaim
it
in

hour
before

that
if
any
crave
redress
of
injustice
they
should
exhibit
their
petitions
in

shows
his
reason

by
an
eminent
body
that
the
law
against
it
but
that
her
tender
shame
will
not
proclaim
against
her
maiden
loss
how
might
she
tongue
me
yet
reason
dares
her
no
for
my
authority
bears
a
so
credent
bulk
that
no
particular
scandal
once
can
touch
but
it
confounds
the
breather
he
should
have
liv
save
that
his
riotous
youth
with
dangerous
sense
might
in
the
times
to
come
have
revenge
by
so
receiving
a
dishonour
life
with
ransom
of
such
shame
would

more
had
i
more
name
for
badness
duke
by
mine
honesty
if
she
be
mad
as
i
believe
no
other
her
madness
hath
the
oddest
frame
of
sense
such
a
dependency
of
thing
on
thing
as
i
heard
in
madness
isabella
o
gracious
duke
harp
not
on
that
nor
do
not
banish
reason
for
inequality
but
let
your
reason
serve
to
make
the
truth
appear
where
it
seems
hid
and
hide
the
false
seems
true
duke
many
that
are
not
mad
have
sure
more
lack
of
reason
what
would
you
say
isabella
i
am
the
sister
of
one
claudio
condemn
upon
the
act
of
fornication
to
lose
his
head
condemn
by
angelo
i
in
probation
of
a
sisterhood
was
sent
to
by
my
brother
one
lucio
as
then
the
lucio
that
i
a
like
your
grace
i
came
to
her
from
claudio
and
desir
her
to
try
her
gracious
fortune
with
lord
angelo
for
her
poor
brother
pardon
isabella
that
he
indeed
duke
you
were
not
bid
to
speak
lucio
no
my
good
lord
nor
wish
to
hold
my
peace
duke
i
wish
you
now
then
pray
you
take
note
of
it
and
when
you
have
a
business
for
yourself
pray
heaven
you
then
be
perfect
lucio
i
warrant
your
honour
duke
the
warrant
for
yourself
take
heed
isabella
this
gentleman
told
somewhat
of
my
tale
lucio
right
duke
it
may
be
right
but
you
are
i
the
wrong
to
speak
before
your
time
proceed
isabella
i
went
to
this
pernicious
caitiff
deputy
duke
that
somewhat
madly
spoken
isabella
pardon
it
the
phrase
is
to
the
matter
duke
mended
again
the
proceed
isabella
in
to
set
the
needless
process
by
how
i
persuaded
how
i
pray
and
kneel
how
he
refell
me
and
how
i
replied
for
this
was
of
much
the
vile
conclusion
i
now
begin
with
grief
and
shame
to
utter
he
would
not
but
by
gift
of
my
chaste
body
to
his
concupiscible
intemperate
lust
release
my
brother
and
after
much
debatement
my
sisterly
remorse
confutes
mine
honour
and
i
did
yield
to
him
but
the
next
morn
betimes
his
purpose
surfeiting
he
sends
a
warrant
for
my
poor
brother
head
duke
this
is
most
likely
isabella
o
that
it
were
as
like
as
it
is
true
duke
by
heaven
fond
wretch
thou
not
what
thou
or
else
thou
art
suborn
against
his
honour
in
hateful
practice
first
his
integrity
stands
without
blemish
next
it
imports
no
reason
that
with
such
vehemency
he
should
pursue
faults
proper
to
himself
if
he
had
so
offended
he
would
have
weigh
thy
brother
by
himself
and
not
have
cut
him
off
some
one
hath
set
you
on
confess
the
truth
and
say
by
whose
advice
thou
here
to
complain
isabella
and
is
this
all
then
o
you
blessed
ministers
above
keep
me
in
patience
and
with
ripened
time
unfold
the
evil
which

here
wrapt
up

her
which

broke
off
partly
for
that
her
promised
proportions
came
short
of
composition
but
in
chief
for
that
her
reputation
was
disvalued
in
levity
since
which
time
of
five
years
i
never
spake
with
her
saw
her
nor
heard

sits
at
your

marvel
why
i
obscur
myself
labouring

save
his

not
rather
make
rash
remonstrance
of
my
hidden
than
let
him
so
be
lost
o
most
kind
maid
it
was
the
swift
celerity
of
his
death
which
i
did
think
with
slower
foot
came
on
that
brain
my
purpose
but
peace
be
with
him
that
life
is
better
life
past
fearing
death
than
that
which
lives
