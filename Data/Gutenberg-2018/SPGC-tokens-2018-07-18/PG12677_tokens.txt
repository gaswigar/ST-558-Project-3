to
carry
a
yellow
walking
stick
down
to
work
lord
mother
of
course
you
do
mean
it
but
she
laid
one
hand
very
lightly
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
the
sullen
angry
young
face
he
made
straight
for
the
main
desk
with
its
battalion
of
clerks
not
waste
any
time
he
said
he
found
his
mother
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
piles
of
pajamas
socks

and
collars

personality

i
making
good
with
mother
when
men
began
to
build
cities
vertically
instead
of
horizontally
there
passed
from
our
highways
a
picturesque
figure
and
from
our
language
an
expressive
figure
of
speech
that
persuasive
stranger
in
the
rusty
prince
albert
and
the
black
string
tie
who
had
been
wont
to
haunt
our
back
steps
and
front
offices
with
his
carefully
wrapped
bundle
retreated
in
bewildered
defeat
before
the
clanging
blows
of
steel
on
steel
that
meant
the
erection
of
the
first
skyscraper
as
slick
we
used
to
say
as
a
agent
of
what
use
his
wares
on
a
building
whose
tower
was
robed
in
clouds
and
which
used
the
chain
lightning
for
a
necklace
the
fourth
avenue
antique
dealer
had
another
curio
to
add
to
his
collection
of
andirons
knockers
snuff
boxes
and
warming
pans
but
even
as
this
quaint
figure
vanished
there
sprang
up
a
new
and
glittering
one
to
take
his
place
he
stood
framed
in
the
great
window
of
the
very
building
which
had
brought
about
the
defeat
of
his
predecessor
a
miracle
of
close
shaving
his
face
was
and
a
marvel
of
immaculateness
his
linen
dapper
he
was
and
dressy
albeit
inclined
to
glittering
effects
and
a
certain
plethory
at
the
back
of
the
neck
back
of
him
stood
shining
shapes
that
reflected
his
glory
in
enamel
and
brass
and
glass
his
language
was
floral
but
choice
his
talk
was
of
gearings
and
bearings
and
cylinders
and
magnetos
his
method
differed
from
that
of
him
who
went
before
as
the
method
of
a
skilled
aëronaut
differs
from
that
of
the
man
who
goes
over
niagara
in
a
barrel
and
as
he
multiplied
and
spread
over
the
land
we
coined
a
new
figure
of
speech
smooth
we
chuckled
as
smooth
as
an
automobile
salesman
but
even
as
we
listened
fascinated
by
his
fluent
verbiage
there
grew
within
us
a
certain
resentment
familiarity
with
his
glittering
wares
bred
a
contempt
of
them
so
that
he
fell
to
speaking
of
them
as
necessities
instead
of
luxuries
he
juggled
figures
and
thought
nothing
of
four
of
them
in
a
row
we
looked
at
our
salary
so
strangely
shrunken
and
thin
now
and
even
as
we
looked
we
saw
that
the
method
of
the
unctuous
anxious
stranger
had
become
antiquated
in
its
turn
then
from
his
ashes
emerged
a
new
being
neither
urger
nor
spellbinder
he
the
twentieth
century
was
stamped
across
his
brow
and
on
his
lips
was
ever
the
word
service
silent
courteous
watchful
alert
he
listened
while
you
talked
his
method
in
turn
made
that
of
the
salesman
sound
like
the
hoarse
hoots
of
the
ballyhoo
man
at
a
county
fair
blithely
he
accepted
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
gave
in
return
a
promise
and
when
we
would
search
our
soul
for
a
synonym
to
express
all
that
was
and
suave
and
judicious
and
patient
and
sure
we
began
to
say
as
alert
as
an
advertising
expert
jock
mcchesney
looking
as
fresh
and
as
only
and
a
cold
shower
can
make
one
look
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
mother
bedroom
his
toilette
had
halted
abruptly
at
the
bathrobe
stage
one
of
those
bulky
garments
swathed
his
slim
figure
while
over
his
left
arm
hung
a
gray
tweed
norfolk
coat
from
his
right
hand
dangled
a
pair
of
trousers
in
pattern
a
modish
jock
regarded
the
gray
garment
on
his
arm
with
moody
eyes
well
i
like
to
know
what
the
matter
with
it
he
demanded
a
trifle
irritably
emma
mcchesney
in
the
act
of
surveying
her
back
hair
in
the
mirror
paused
hand
glass
poised
half
way
to
regard
her
son
all
right
she
answered
cheerfully
i
tell
you
it
too
young
young
he
held
it
at
arm
length
and
stared
at
it
what
mean
young
emma
mcchesney
came
forward
wrapping
the
folds
of
her
kimono
about
her
she
took
the
disputed
garment
in
one
hand
and
held
it
aloft
i
know
that
you
look
like
a
man
on
a
magazine
cover
in
it
but
norfolk
suits
spell
tennis
and
seashore
and
elegant
leisure
and
you
going
out
this
morning
son
to
interview
business
men
you
going
to
try
to
impress
the
advertising
world
with
the
fact
that
it
needs
your
expert
services
you
walk
into
a
business
office
in
a
norfolk
suit
and
everybody
from
the
office
boy
to
the
president
of
the
company
will
ask
you
what
your
score
is
she
tossed
it
back
over
his
arm
i
wear
the
black
and
white
said
jock
resignedly
and
turned
toward
his
own
room
at
his
doorway
he
paused
and
raised
his
voice
slightly
for
that
matter
they
looking
for
young
men
everybody
young
why
the
biggest
men
in
the
advertising
game
are
just
kids
he
disappeared
within
his
room
still
talking
look
at
mcquirk
advertising
manager
of
the
combs
car
company
he
so
young
he
has
to
disguise
himself
in
with
a
black
ribbon
to
get
away
with
it
look
at
hopper
of
the
berg
shriner
company
pulls
down
ninety
thousand
a
year
and
if
he
i
well
you
asked
my
advice
interrupted
his
mother
voice
with
that
muffled
effect
which
is
caused
by
a
skirt
being
slipped
over
the
head
and
i
gave
it
wear
a
white
duck
sailor
suit
with
blue
anchors
and
carry
a
red
tin
pail
and
a
shovel
if
you
want
to
look
young
only
get
into
it
in
a
jiffy
son
because
breakfast
will
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
i
can
tell
by
the
way
annie
crashing
the
cups
so
step
lively
if
you
want
to
pay
your
lovely
subway
fare
ten
minutes
later
the
slim
young
figure
in
its
black
and
white
sat
opposite
emma
mcchesney
at
the
breakfast
table
and
between
excited
gulps
of
coffee
outlined
a
meteoric
career
in
his
chosen
field
and
the
more
he
talked
and
the
rosier
his
figures
of
speech
became
the
more
silent
and
thoughtful
fell
his
mother
she
wondered
if
five
would
find
a
droop
to
the
set
of
those
young
shoulders
if
the
springy
young
legs
in
their
absurdly
scant
modish
trousers
would
have
lost
some
of
their
elasticity
if
the
buoyant
step
in
the
shoes
would
not
drag
a
little
thirteen
years
of
business
experience
had
taught
her
to
swallow
smilingly
the
bitter
pill
of
rebuff
but
this
boy
was
to
experience
his
first
dose
she
felt
again
that
sensation
of
almost
physical
nausea
that
sickness
of
heart
and
spirit
which
had
come
over
her
when
she
had
met
her
first
sneer
and
intolerant
shrug
it
had
been
her
maiden
trip
on
the
road
for
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
she
was
secretary
of
that
company
now
and
moving
spirit
in
its
policy
but
the
wound
of
that
first
insult
still
ached
a
word
from
her
would
have
placed
the
boy
and
saved
him
from
curt
refusals
she
withheld
that
word
he
must
fight
his
fight
alone
i
want
to
write
the
kind
of
ad
jock
was
saying
excitedly
that
you
see
staring
at
in
the
subways
and
street
cars
and
i
want
to
sit
across
the
aisle
and
watch
their
faces
staring
at
that
oblong
and
reading
it
aloud
to
each
other
is
that
an
awfully
obvious
necktie
you
wearing
jock
inquired
his
mother
irrelevantly
this
you
ought
to
see
some
of
them
this
is
a
quaker
stock
in
comparison
he
glanced
down
complacently
at
the
silken
scarf
that
the
season
mode
demanded
immediately
he
was
off
again
and
the
first
thing
you
know
mcchesney
have
a
motor
truck
backing
up
at
the
door
once
a
month
and
six
strong
men
carrying
my
salary
to
the
freight
elevator
in
sacks
emma
mcchesney
buttered
her
bit
of
toast
then
looked
up
to
remark
quietly
had
you
better
qualify
for
the
trial
heats
jock
before
you
jump
into
the
finals
trial
heats
sneered
jock
they
poky
i
want
real
money
now
it
is
enough
to
be
just
in
these
days
it
needs
money
i
want
to
be
rich
not
just
prosperous
but
rich
so
rich
that
i
can
let
the
bath
soap
float
around
in
the
water
without
any
pricks
of
conscience
so
successful
that
they
say
he
a
mere
boy
too
imagine
and
jock
dear
emma
mcchesney
said
you
still
to
learn
that
plans
and
ambitions
are
like
soap
bubbles
the
harder
you
blow
and
the
more
you
inflate
them
the
quicker
they
burst
plans
and
ambitions
are
things
to
be
kept
locked
away
in
your
heart
son
with
no
one
but
yourself
to
take
an
occasional
peep
at
them
jock
leaned
over
the
table
with
his
charming
smile
you
a
jealous
blonde
he
laughed
because
i
going
to
be
a
captain
of
finance
an
advertising
wizard
you
afraid
i
grab
the
glory
all
away
from
you
illustration
a
jealous
blond
he
said
mcchesney
folded
her
napkin
and
rose
she
looked
unbelievably
young
and
trim
and
radiant
to
be
the
mother
of
this
boasting
boy
i
not
afraid
she
drawled
a
wicked
little
glint
in
her
blue
eyes
you
see
they
only
regard
your
feats
and
say
no
wonder
he
ought
to
be
able
to
sell
ice
to
an
eskimo
his
mother
was
emma
mcchesney
and
then
being
a
modern
mother
she
donned
smart
autumn
hat
and
tailored
suit
coat
and
stood
ready
to
reach
her
office
by
but
because
she
was
as
motherly
as
she
was
modern
she
swung
open
the
door
between
kitchen
and
to
advise
with
annie
the
adept
lamb
chops
eh
annie
and
sweet
potatoes
jock
loves
and
corn
au
gratin
and
some
head
lettuce
she
glanced
toward
jock
in
the
hallway
then
lowered
her
voice
annie
she
teased
just
give
us
one
of
your
peach
cobblers
will
you
you
see
he
he
going
to
be
awfully
tired
when
he
gets
home
so
they
went
stepping
off
to
work
together
mother
and
son
a
mother
of
years
before
would
have
watched
her
son
with
eyes
from
the
porch
of
a
cottage
there
was
no
watching
a
son
from
the
tenth
floor
of
an
apartment
house
besides
she
had
her
work
to
do
the
subway
swallowed
both
of
them
together
they
jostled
and
swung
their
way
in
the
close
packed
train
at
the
street
station
jock
left
her
you
have
dinner
with
a
professional
gent
he
bragged
in
his
youth
and
exuberance
and
was
off
down
the
aisle
and
out
on
the
platform
emma
mcchesney
managed
to
turn
in
her
space
of
train
seat
so
that
she
watched
the
slim
buoyant
young
figure
from
the
window
until
the
train
drew
away
and
he
was
lost
in
the
stairway
jam
just
so
rachel
had
watched
the
boy
joseph
go
to
meet
the
persian
caravans
in
the
desert
do
let
them
buffalo
you
jock
emma
had
said
just
before
he
left
her
they
try
it
if
they
give
you
a
broom
and
tell
you
to
sweep
down
the
back
stairs
take
it
and
sweep
and
forget
the
corners
and
if
while
you
sweeping
you
notice
that
that
kind
of
broom
is
suited
to
the
stairs
go
in
and
suggest
a
new
kind
they
like
it
brooms
and
back
stairways
had
no
place
in
jock
mcchesney
mind
as
the
mahogany
and
gold
elevator
shot
him
up
to
the
fourteenth
floor
of
the
great
office
building
that
housed
the
berg
shriner
company
down
the
marble
hallway
he
went
and
into
the
reception
room
a
cruel
test
it
was
that
reception
room
with
the
cruelty
peculiar
to
the
modern
in
business
with
its
lamp
its
rug
its
jacobean
chairs
its
cathedral
oak
table
its
pot
of
bright
flowers
making
a
smart
touch
of
color
in
the
somber
richness
of
the
room
it
was
no
place
for
the
shabby
the
the
cringing
the
rusty
or
the
mendicant
jock
mcchesney
from
the
tips
of
his
shoes
to
his
radiant
face
took
the
test
and
stood
it
triumphantly
he
had
entered
with
an
air
in
which
was
mingled
the
briskness
of
assurance
with
the
languor
of
ease
there
were
times
when
jock
mcchesney
was
every
inch
the
son
of
his
mother
there
advanced
toward
jock
a
large
plump
dignified
personage
a
personage
courteous
yet
reserved
inquiring
yet
not
offensively
curious
a
very
machiavelli
of
ushers
even
while
his
lips
questioned
his
eyes
appraised
clothes
character
conduct
hupp
please
said
jock
serene
in
the
perfection
of
his
shirt
tie
collar
and
scarf
pin
upon
which
the
appraising
eye
now
rested
mr
mcchesney
he
produced
a
card
appointment
no
but
he
see
me
but
machiavelli
had
seen
too
many
overconfident
callers
their
very
confidence
had
taught
him
caution
if
you
will
please
state
your
ah
business
jock
smiled
a
little
patient
smile
and
brushed
an
imaginary
fleck
of
dust
from
the
sleeve
of
his
very
correct
coat
i
want
to
ask
him
for
a
job
as
office
boy
he
jibed
an
answering
grin
overspread
the
fat
features
of
the
usher
even
an
usher
likes
his
little
joke
the
sense
of
humor
dies
hard
i
have
a
letter
from
him
asking
me
to
call
said
jock
to
clinch
it
this
way
the
keeper
of
the
door
led
jock
toward
the
sacred
inner
portal
and
held
it
open
hupp
is
the
last
door
to
the
right
the
door
closed
behind
him
jock
found
himself
in
the
big
busy
central
office
down
either
side
of
the
great
room
ran
a
row
of
tiny
private
offices
each
partitioned
off
each
outfitted
with
desk
and
chairs
and
a
big
bright
window
on
his
way
to
the
last
door
at
the
right
jock
glanced
into
each
tiny
office
glimpsing
busy
men
bent
absorbedly
over
papers
girls
busy
with
dictation
here
and
there
a
door
revealing
two
men
or
three
deep
in
discussion
of
a
problem
heads
close
together
voices
low
faces
earnest
it
came
suddenly
to
the
smartly
modish
overconfident
boy
walking
the
length
of
the
long
room
that
the
last
person
needed
in
this
marvelously
perfected
and
organization
was
a
somewhat
awed
young
man
named
jock
mcchesney
there
came
to
him
that
strange
sensation
which
comes
to
every
that
feeling
of
having
his
spiritual
legs
carry
him
out
of
the
room
past
the
door
down
the
hall
and
into
the
street
even
as
in
reality
they
bore
him
on
to
the
very
presence
which
he
dreaded
and
yet
wished
to
see
two
steps
more
and
he
stood
in
the
last
doorway
right
no
matinee
idol
nervously
awaiting
his
cue
in
the
wings
could
have
planned
his
entrance
more
carefully
than
jock
had
planned
this
ease
was
the
thing
ease
bordering
on
nonchalance
mixed
with
a
brisk
and
businesslike
assurance
the
entrance
was
lost
on
the
man
at
the
desk
he
did
not
even
look
up
if
jock
had
entered
on
doing
a
double
tango
to
vocal
accompaniment
it
is
doubtful
if
the
man
at
the
desk
would
have
looked
up
pencil
between
his
fingers
head
held
a
trifle
to
one
side
in
critical
contemplation
of
the
work
before
him
eyes
narrowed
judicially
lips
pursed
he
was
the
concentrated
essence
of
illustration
he
was
the
concentrated
essence
of
jock
waited
a
moment
in
silence
the
man
at
the
desk
worked
on
his
head
was
jock
knew
him
to
be
thirty
jock
fixed
his
eye
on
the
spot
and
spoke
my
name
mcchesney
he
began
i
wrote
you
three
days
ago
you
probably
will
remember
you
replied
asking
me
to
call
and
i
minute
exploded
the
man
at
the
desk
still
absorbed
jock
faltered
stopped
the
man
at
the
desk
did
not
look
up
a
moment
of
silence
except
for
the
sound
of
the
busy
pencil
traveling
across
the
paper
jock
glaring
at
the
spot
spoke
again
of
course
hupp
if
you
too
busy
to
see
me
a
preoccupied
hum
such
as
a
busy
man
makes
when
he
is
trying
to
give
attention
to
two
why
i
suppose
there
no
sense
in
staying
but
it
seems
to
me
that
common
courtesy
the
busy
pencil
paused
quivered
in
the
making
of
a
final
period
enclosed
the
dot
in
a
proofreader
circle
and
rolled
away
across
the
desk
its
work
done
now
said
sam
hupp
and
swung
around
smiling
to
face
the
affronted
jock
i
had
to
get
that
out
they
waiting
for
it
he
pressed
a
desk
button
what
can
i
do
for
you
sit
down
sit
down
there
was
a
certain
abrupt
geniality
about
him
his
glasses
gave
him
an
oddly
owlish
look
like
a
small
boy
taking
liberties
with
grandfather
spectacles
jock
found
himself
sitting
down
his
anger
slipping
from
him
my
name
mcchesney
he
began
i
here
because
i
want
to
work
for
this
concern
he
braced
himself
to
present
the
convincing
arguments
with
which
he
had
prepared
himself
whereupon
sam
hupp
the
brisk
proceeded
to
whisk
his
breath
and
arguments
away
with
an
unexpected
all
right
what
do
you
want
to
do
jock
mouth
fell
open
do
he
stammered
do
why
anything
sam
hupp
quick
eye
swept
over
the
slim
attractive
radiant
young
figure
before
him
unconsciously
he
rubbed
his
bald
spot
with
a
rueful
hand
know
anything
about
writing
or
advertising
jock
was
at
ease
immediately
quite
a
lot
yes
i
practically
rewrote
the
gridiron
play
that
we
gave
last
year
and
i
was
assistant
advertising
manager
of
the
college
publications
for
two
years
that
gives
a
fellow
a
pretty
broad
knowledge
of
advertising
oh
lord
groaned
sam
hupp
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
if
in
pain
jock
stared
the
affronted
feeling
was
returning
sam
hupp
recovered
himself
and
smiled
a
little
wistfully
mcchesney
when
i
came
up
here
twelve
years
ago
i
got
a
job
as
usher
a
usher
is
an
office
boy
in
long
pants
sometimes
when
i
optimistic
i
think
that
if
i
live
twelve
years
longer
i
begin
to
know
something
about
the
rudiments
of
this
game
oh
of
course
began
jock
apologetically
but
hupp
glance
was
over
his
head
involuntarily
jock
turned
to
follow
the
direction
of
his
eyes
busy
said
a
voice
from
the
doorway
come
in
dutch
come
in
boomed
hupp
the
man
who
entered
was
of
the
sort
that
the
boldest
might
well
hesitate
to
address
as
dutch
a
tall
slim
elegant
figure
bronzed
mcchesney
this
is
von
herman
head
of
our
art
department
their
hands
met
in
a
brief
clasp
von
herman
thoughts
were
evidently
elsewhere
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
that
cussed
model
skipped
out
gone
with
a
show
just
when
i
had
the
whole
series
blocked
out
in
my
mind
he
was
a
wonder
no
brains
but
a
marvel
for
looks
and
style
these
people
want
real
stuff
do
know
how
i
going
to
give
it
to
them
now
hupp
sat
up
got
to
he
snapped
campaign
late
as
it
is
ca
you
get
an
ordinary
man
model
and
fake
the
greek
god
beauty
yes
but
it
look
faked
if
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
a
chap
who
could
wear
clothes
as
if
they
belonged
to
him
hupp
rose
here
your
man
he
cried
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
clothes
look
at
him
he
invented
why
you
could
photograph
him
and
he
look
like
a
drawing
von
herman
turned
surprised
incredulous
hopeful
his
artist
eye
brightening
at
the
ease
and
grace
and
modishness
of
the
smart
figure
before
him
me
exploded
jock
his
face
suffused
with
a
dull
painful
red
me
pose
for
a
clothing
ad
well
hupp
reminded
him
you
said
you
do
anything
jock
mcchesney
glared
belligerently
hupp
returned
the
stare
with
a
faint
gleam
of
amusement
shining
behind
the
absurd
glasses
the
amused
look
changed
to
surprise
as
he
beheld
the
glare
in
eyes
fading
for
even
as
he
glared
there
had
come
a
warning
to
jock
a
warning
sent
just
in
time
from
that
wireless
station
located
in
his
subconscious
mind
a
vivid
face
full
of
pride
and
hope
and
encouragement
flashed
before
him
jock
it
said
do
let
buffalo
you
they
try
it
if
they
give
you
a
broom
and
tell
you
to
sweep
down
the
back
stairs
jock
was
smiling
his
charming
boyish
smile
lead
me
to
your
north
light
he
laughed
at
von
herman
got
any
robert
chambers
heroines
tucked
away
there
hupp
broad
hand
came
down
on
his
shoulder
with
a
thwack
the
spirit
mcchesney
that
the
he
stopped
abruptly
say
are
you
related
to
emma
mcchesney
of
the
featherloom
skirt
company
slightly
she
my
one
and
only
mother
she
you
mean
her
son
well
i
be
darned
he
held
out
his
hand
to
jock
if
you
a
real
son
of
your
mother
i
wish
just
call
the
office
boy
as
you
step
down
the
hall
with
von
herman
and
tell
him
to
bring
me
a
hammer
and
a
couple
of
spikes
better
nail
down
my
desk
i
promise
not
to
crowd
you
for
a
year
or
two
grinned
jock
from
the
doorway
and
was
off
with
the
pleased
von
herman
past
the
double
row
of
beehives
again
into
the
elevator
out
again
up
a
narrow
iron
stairway
into
a
busy
cluttered
skylighted
room
pictures
posters
photographs
hung
all
about
some
of
the
pictures
jock
recognized
as
old
friends
that
had
gazed
familiarly
at
him
from
subway
trains
and
street
cars
and
theater
programmes
golf
clubs
tennis
rackets
walking
sticks
billiard
cues
were
stacked
up
in
corners
and
yet
there
was
a
bare
and
orderly
look
about
the
place
two
silent
men
were
busy
at
drawing
boards
through
a
doorway
beyond
jock
could
see
others
similarly
engaged
in
the
next
room
on
a
platform
in
one
corner
of
the
room
posed
a
young
man
in
one
of
those
costumes
the
coat
of
which
is
a
mongrel
mixture
of
cutaway
and
sack
you
see
them
worn
by
clergymen
with
unsecular
ideas
in
dress
and
by
the
leader
of
the
counterfeiters
gang
in
the
moving
pictures
the
pose
was
that
met
with
in
the
backs
of
magazines
the
head
lifted
eyes
fixed
on
an
interesting
object
unseen
one
arm
crooked
to
hold
a
cane
one
foot
advanced
the
other
trailing
slightly
to
give
a
fifth
avenue
four
air
his
face
was
expressionless
on
his
head
was
a
sadly
unironed
silk
hat
von
herman
glanced
at
the
drawing
tacked
to
the
board
of
one
of
the
men
that
do
flynn
he
said
to
the
model
he
glanced
again
at
the
drawing
bring
out
the
hat
a
little
more
mack
they
wo
burnish
it
if
you
do
to
the
artist
then
turning
about
where
that
girl
from
a
far
corner
sheltered
by
long
green
curtains
stepped
a
graceful
almost
childishly
slim
figure
in
a
norfolk
suit
and
hat
from
beneath
which
curled
a
fluff
of
bright
golden
hair
von
herman
stared
at
her
you
not
the
girl
he
said
you
wo
do
you
sent
for
me
retorted
the
girl
i
miss
michelin
gelda
michelin
i
posed
for
you
six
months
ago
but
i
been
out
of
town
with
the
show
since
then
von
herman
frowning
opened
a
table
drawer
pulled
out
a
card
index
ran
his
long
fingers
through
it
and
extracted
a
card
he
glanced
at
it
and
then
the
frown
deepening
read
it
aloud
gelda
telephone
bryant
brunette
medium
build
good
neck
and
eyes
good
figure
good
clothes
he
glanced
up
well
that
me
said
miss
michelin
calmly
i
got
the
same
telephone
number
and
eyes
and
neck
and
clothes
of
course
my
hair
is
different
and
i
am
thinner
but
that
business
i
like
to
know
what
chance
a
fat
girl
would
have
in
the
chorus
these
days
von
herman
groaned
i
pay
you
for
the
time
you
waited
and
for
your
trouble
ca
use
you
for
these
pictures
then
as
she
left
he
turned
a
comically
despairing
face
to
the
two
men
at
the
drawing
boards
what
are
we
going
to
do
we
got
to
make
a
start
on
these
pictures
and
everything
has
gone
wrong
they
want
something
special
two
figures
young
man
and
woman
said
expressly
they
did
want
a
chicken
no
romping
curls
and
none
of
that
eyes
and
lips
stuff
this
chap
ideal
for
the
man
he
pointed
to
jock
jock
had
been
staring
fascinated
at
the
shaded
zigzag
marks
which
the
artist
youth
was
making
on
the
sheet
of
paper
before
him
he
had
scarcely
glanced
up
during
the
entire
scene
now
he
looked
briefly
and
coolly
at
jock
where
did
you
get
him
he
asked
with
the
precise
enunciation
of
the
good
figure
and
he
wears
his
clothes
not
like
a
cab
driver
as
the
others
do
thanks
drawled
jock
flushing
a
little
then
boyish
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
him
say
tell
me
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
to
that
drawing
he
of
the
velvety
eyes
smiled
a
twisted
little
smile
his
slim
brown
fingers
never
stopped
in
their
work
of
guiding
the
pen
in
its
zigzag
path
it
is
work
he
sneered
to
delight
the
soul
of
an
artist
i
am
now
engaged
in
the
pleasing
task
of
putting
the
bones
in
a
herringbone
suit
but
jock
did
not
smile
here
was
another
man
he
thought
who
had
been
given
a
broom
and
told
to
sweep
down
the
stairway
von
herman
was
regarding
him
almost
wistfully
i
hate
to
let
you
slip
he
said
then
his
face
brightening
by
jove
i
wonder
if
miss
galt
would
pose
for
us
if
we
told
her
what
a
fix
we
were
in
he
picked
up
the
telephone
receiver
miss
galt
please
he
said
then
aside
of
course
it
nerve
to
ask
a
girl
who
earning
three
thousand
a
year
to
leave
her
desk
and
come
up
and
pose
for
hello
miss
galt
jock
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
models
platform
was
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
even
this
end
of
the
advertising
business
had
its
interesting
side
he
thought
ten
minutes
later
he
knew
it
had
ten
minutes
later
there
appeared
miss
galt
jock
left
off
swinging
his
legs
from
the
platform
and
stood
up
miss
galt
was
that
kind
of
girl
smooth
black
hair
parted
and
coiled
low
as
only
an
exquisitely
shaped
head
can
dare
to
wear
its
a
face
whose
expression
was
sweetly
serious
in
spite
of
its
youth
a
girl
whose
clothes
were
the
sort
of
clothes
that
girls
ought
to
wear
in
offices
and
do
this
is
mighty
good
of
you
miss
galt
began
von
herman
the
kool
komfort
klothes
company
summer
campaign
stuff
only
need
you
for
an
hour
or
so
to
get
the
expression
and
general
outline
poster
stuff
really
then
this
young
man
will
pose
for
the
summer
union
suit
pictures
do
apologize
said
miss
galt
we
had
a
hard
enough
time
to
get
that
kool
komfort
account
we
do
want
to
start
wrong
with
the
pictures
besides
i
think
posing
real
fun
jock
thought
so
too
quite
suddenly
just
as
suddenly
von
herman
remembered
the
conventions
and
introduced
them
mcchesney
repeated
miss
galt
crisply
i
know
a
mcchesney
of
the
buck
my
mother
proudly
your
mother
then
why
she
stopped
because
said
jock
i
the
rawest
rooky
in
the
berg
shriner
company
and
when
i
begin
to
realize
what
i
do
know
about
advertising
i
probably
want
to
plunge
off
the
palisades
miss
galt
smiled
up
at
him
her
clear
frank
eyes
meeting
his
you
win
she
said
even
if
i
lose
i
win
now
said
jock
suddenly
audacious
hi
hold
that
pose
called
von
herman
happily
illustration
hold
that
pose
called
von
herman
ii
personality
plus
there
are
seven
stages
in
the
evolution
of
that
individual
whose
appearance
is
the
signal
for
a
listless
from
the
anæmic
little
girl
who
sits
in
the
outer
office
forever
reading
last
month
magazines
the
badge
of
fear
brands
the
novice
standing
hat
in
hand
nervous
apprehensive
gulpy
with
the
elevator
door
clanging
behind
him
and
the
sacred
inner
door
closed
before
him
he
offers
up
a
silent
and
paradoxical
thank
heaven
at
the
office
girl
languid
not
in
and
dives
into
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
next
elevator
going
down
when
at
that
same
message
he
can
smile
as
with
a
certain
grim
agreeableness
he
says
i
wait
then
has
he
reached
the
seventh
stage
and
taken
the
orders
of
the
regularly
ordained
jock
mcchesney
had
learned
to
judge
an
unknown
prospective
by
glancing
at
his
hall
rug
and
stenographer
which
marks
the
fifth
stage
he
had
learned
to
regard
office
boys
with
something
less
than
hate
he
had
learned
to
let
the
other
fellow
do
the
talking
he
had
learned
to
condense
a
written
report
into
words
and
he
had
learned
that
there
was
as
much
difference
between
the
profession
of
advertising
as
he
had
thought
of
it
and
advertising
as
it
really
was
as
there
is
between
a
steam
calliope
and
a
cathedral
pipe
organ
in
the
big
office
of
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
they
had
begun
to
chuckle
a
bit
over
the
mcchesney
solicitor
reports
those
same
reports
indicated
that
young
mcchesney
was
beginning
to
find
the
key
to
that
maddening
jumble
of
complexities
known
as
human
nature
big
sam
hupp
who
was
the
pet
caged
genius
of
the
place
used
even
to
bring
an
occasional
example
of
jock
business
badinage
into
the
old
man
office
and
the
two
would
grin
in
secret

when
they

quite
a
reputation
for
business
acumen
with
this
one
attribute
spent
last
year
holding
his
breath
preparatory
to
taking
another
plunge
it
was
about
the
time
that
jock
mcchesney
had
got
over
the
novelty
of
paying
for
his
own
clothes
and
had
begun
to
talk
business
in
a
slightly
patronizing
way
to
his
clever
and
secretly
amused
mother
emma
mcchesney
secretary
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
that
sam
hupp
noticed
a
rather
cocky
in
jock
attitude
toward
the
world
in
general
whereupon
he
sent
for
him
on
sam
hupp
broad
flat
desk
stood
an
array
of
diminutive
jars
and
bottles
and
tiny
pots
that
would
have
shamed
the
toilette
table
of
a
musical
comedy
star
there
were
salves
in
white
bottles
there
were
white
creams
in
jars
there
were
tins
of
ointment
and
boxes
of
fragrant
soap
jock
mcchesney
entering
briskly
eyed
the
array
in
some
surprise
then
he
grinned
and
glanced
wickedly
at
sam
hupp
prematurely
bald
head
no
use
hupp
they
say
if
it
once
gone
it
gone
get
a
toupee
shut
up
growled
sam
hupp
stay
in
this
game
long
enough
and
you
be
a
hairless
wonder
yourself
ten
years
ago
the
girls
used
to
have
to
tie
their
hands
or
wear
mittens
to
keep
from
running
their
white
fingers
through
my
waving
silken
locks
sit
down
a
minute
jock
reached
forward
and
took
up
a
jar
of
cream
he
frowned
in
thought
then
thought
i
recognized
this
stuff
mother
uses
it
i
seen
it
on
the
bathroom
shelf
you
bet
she
uses
it
retorted
sam
hupp
what
more
millions
of
other
women
will
be
using
it
in
the
next
few
years
this
woman
he
pointed
to
the
name
on
the
label
has
hit
upon
the
real
thing
in
toilette
she
made
a
little
fortune
already
and
if
she
do
look
out
she
be
rich
they
got
quite
a
plant
when
she
started
she
used
to
put
the
stuff
together
herself
over
the
kitchen
stove
they
say
it
made
of
cottage
cheese
stirred
smooth
and
tinted
pink
well
anyway
nationally
known
now
or
will
be
when
they
start
to
advertise
right
i
seen
some
of
their
stuff
advertised
somewhere
interrupted
jock
but
i
do
remember
there
you
are
you
see
the
head
of
this
concern
is
a
little
bit
frightened
at
the
way
she
seems
slated
to
become
a
lady
cold
cream
magnate
they
say
she
scared
pink
for
fear
somebody
will
steal
her
recipes
she
has
a
kid
nephew
who
acts
as
general
manager
and
they
both
on
the
job
all
the
time
they
say
the
lady
herself
looks
like
the
spinster
in
a
drama
you
can
get
a
boy
to
look
up
your
train
schedule
train
schedule
across
jock
mcchesney
mind
there
flashed
a
vision
of
himself
alert
confident
brisk
taking
the
luxurious
nine
for
philadelphia
or
maybe
the
limited
to
chicago
dashing
down
to
the
station
in
a
taxi
of
course
strolling
down
the
car
aisle
to
take
his
place
among
those
other
thoroughbreds
of
commerce
men
whose
chamois
gloves
and
walking
sticks
and
talk
of
golf
and
baseball
and
motoring
spelled
elegant
leisure
even
as
their
keen
eyes
and
shrewd
faces
and
exchange
of
such
terms
as
stocks
and
sales
and
propositions
proclaimed
them
intent
on
bagging
the
day
business
sam
hupp
next
words
brought
him
back
to
reality
with
a
jerk
i
think
you
have
to
change
at
buffalo
it
gets
you
to
tonawanda
in
the
morning
rotten
train
tonawanda
repeated
jock
now
listen
kid
sam
hupp
leaned
forward
and
his
eyes
behind
their
great
round
glasses
were
intent
on
jock
not
going
to
try
to
steer
you
you
think
that
advertising
is
a
game
it
is
there
are
those
who
think
it
a
science
but
it
is
that
either
it
white
magic
that
what
it
is
and
you
ca
learn
it
from
books
any
more
than
you
can
master
trout
fishing
from
reading
complete
angler
he
swung
about
and
swept
the
beauty
lotions
before
him
in
a
little
heap
at
the
end
of
his
desk
here
take
this
stuff
and
get
chummy
with
it
eat
it
if
necessary
learn
it
somehow
jock
stood
up
a
little
dazed
but
what
how
i
mean
sam
hupp
glanced
up
at
him
sending
you
down
there
is
my
idea
it
the
old
man
he
got
an
idea
that
you
he
paused
and
put
a
detaining
hand
on
jock
mcchesney
arm
look
here
you
think
i
know
a
little
something
about
advertising
do
you
you
laughed
jock
you
the
guy
who
put
the
whitening
in
the
great
white
way
everybody
knows
you
were
the
thanks
interrupted
sam
hupp
a
little
dryly
let
me
tell
you
something
young
i
got
what
you
might
call
a
mind
i
keep
it
running
on
high
all
the
time
with
the
muffler
cut
out
and
you
can
hear
me
coming
for
miles
but
the
old
man
he
leaned
forward
impressively
the
old
man
boy
has
the
kind
built
like
a
watch
no
smoke
no
dripping
and
you
ca
even
hear
the
engine
purr
but
when
he
throws
her
open
well
he
can
pass
everything
on
the
road
forget
that
he
turned
to
his
desk
again
and
reached
for
a
stack
of
papers
and
cuts
good
luck
to
you
if
you
want
any
further
details
you
can
get
from
hayes
he
plunged
into
his
work
there
arose
in
jock
mcchesney
mind
that
instinct
of
the
man
in
his
hour
of
triumph
the
desire
to
tell
a
woman
of
his
greatness
he
paused
a
second
outside
sam
hupp
office
turned
and
walked
quickly
down
the
length
of
the
great
central
room
he
stopped
before
a
little
glass
door
at
the
end
tapped
lightly
and
entered
grace
galt
looked
up
frowning
a
little
then
she
smiled
miss
galt
had
a
complete
layout
on
the
desk
before
her
scrap
books
cuts
copy
magazines
there
was
a
little
smudge
on
the
end
of
her
nose
grace
galt
was
writing
about
magnetos
she
was
writing
about
magnetos
in
a
way
to
make
you
want
to
drop
your
customer
or
your
ironing
or
your
game
and
go
downtown
and
buy
that
particular
kind
of
magneto
at
once
which
is
the
secretest
part
of
the
wizardry
of
advertising
copy
to
look
at
grace
galt
you
would
have
thought
that
she
should
have
been
writing
about
the
jars
in
jock
mcchesney
hands
instead
of
about
such
things
as
ignition
and
insulation
and
ball
bearings
and
induction
windings
but
it
was
grace
galt
gift
that
she
could
take
just
such
hard
dry
technical
facts
and
weave
them
into
a
story
that
you
followed
to
the
end
she
could
make
you
see
the
romance
in
condensers
and
transformers
she
had
the
power
that
caused
the
reader
to
lose
himself
in
the
charm
of
magnetic
poles
and
ball
bearings
and
sparks
just
dropped
in
to
say
said
jock
very
casually
going
to
run
to
see
the
athena
company
toilette
specialties
you
know
it
ought
to
be
a
big
account
athena
grace
galt
regarded
him
absently
her
mind
still
on
her
work
then
her
eyes
cleared
you
mean
at
tonawanda
and
sending
you
well
she
put
out
a
congratulatory
hand
jock
gripped
it
gratefully
not
so
bad
eh
he
boasted
bad
echoed
grace
galt
her
face
became
serious
do
you
realize
that
there
are
men
in
this
office
who
have
been
here
for
five
years
six
years
or
even
more
and
who
have
never
been
given
a
chance
to
do
anything
but
stenography
or
perhaps
some
private
secretarying
i
know
it
agreed
jock
but
there
was
no
humbleness
in
his
tone
he
radiated
he
seemed
to
grow
and
expand
before
her
eyes
a
little
shadow
of
doubt
crept
across
grace
expression
of
friendly
interest
are
you
scared
she
asked
just
the
least
bit
jock
flushed
a
little
well
he
confessed
ruefully
i
mind
telling
you
i
am
a
little
good
good
yes
the
head
of
that
concern
is
a
woman
that
one
reason
why
they
did
send
me
i
suppose
i
i
like
to
say
something
if
you
do
mind
anything
you
like
said
jock
graciously
well
then
do
be
afraid
of
being
embarrassed
and
fussed
if
you
blush
and
stammer
a
little
she
like
it
play
up
the
coy
stuff
the
coy
stuff
echoed
jock
i
had
thought
much
about
my
attitude
toward
the
er
the
lady
a
little
stiffly
well
you
better
answered
miss
galt
crisply
she
put
out
her
hand
in
much
the
same
manner
as
sam
hupp
had
used
good
luck
to
you
i
have
to
ask
you
to
go
now
i
trying
to
make
this
magneto
sound
like
something
without
which
no
home
is
complete
and
to
make
people
see
that
there
as
much
difference
between
it
and
every
other
magneto
as
there
is
between
the
steam
shovels
that
dug
out
the
panama
canal
and
the
junk
that
the
french
left
there
she
stopped
her
eyes
took
on
a
look
her
lips
were
parted
slightly
why
that
not
a
bad
idea
that
last
use
that
i
illustration
with
a
jolt
jock
realized
she
had
forgotten
all
about
him
she
began
to
scribble
rapidly
on
the
sheet
of
paper
before
her
with
a
jolt
jock
mcchesney
realized
that
she
had
forgotten
all
about
him
he
walked
quietly
to
the
door
opened
it
shut
it
very
quietly
then
made
for
the
nearest
telephone
he
knew
one
woman
he
could
count
on
to
be
proud
of
him
he
gave
his
number
waited
a
little
eager
moment
then
featherloom
petticoat
company
mrs
mcchesney
and
waited
again
then
he
smiled
you
need
sound
so
official
he
laughed
it
only
your
son
listen
i
he
took
on
an
elaborate
carelessness
of
tone
got
to
take
a
little
jump
out
of
town
on
business
oh
a
day
or
so
rather
important
though
i
have
time
to
run
up
to
the
flat
and
throw
a
few
things
into
a
bag
i
tell
you
i
really
ought
to
keep
a
bag
packed
down
here
in
case
of
emergency
you
know
what
it
the
athena
toilette
preparations
company
well
i
should
say
it
is
i
wire
you
you
bet
thanks
my
what
oh
toothbrush
no
so
it
was
that
at
jock
mcchesney
took
himself
his
hopes
his
dread
and
his
smart
walrus
bag
aboard
a
train
that
halted
and
snuffed
and
backed
and
bumped
and
halted
with
maddening
frequency
but
it
landed
him
at
last
in
a
little
town
bearing
the
characteristics
of
all
american
little
towns
it
was
surprisingly
full
of
cars
and
five
and
stores
and
banks
with
doric
columns
and
paved
streets
after
he
had
registered
at
the
hotel
and
as
he
was
cleaning
up
a
bit
he
passed
an
amused
eye
over
the
bare
ugly
fusty
little
hotel
bedroom
but
somehow
as
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
graceful
pleasing
figure
of
youth
and
confidence
the
smile
faded
towel
in
hand
he
surveyed
the
barrenness
of
it
he
stared
at
the
impossible
wall
paper
at
the
battered
furniture
the
worn
carpet
he
sniffed
the
stuffy
smell
of
what
was
that
smell
anyhow
straw
and
matting
and
dust
and
the
of
hundreds
who
had
occupied
the
room
before
him
it
came
over
him
with
something
of
a
shock
that
this
same
sort
of
room
had
been
his
mother
only
home
in
the
ten
years
she
had
spent
on
the
road
as
a
traveling
saleswoman
for
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
this
was
what
she
had
left
in
the
morning
to
this
she
had
come
back
at
night
as
he
stared
ahead
of
him
there
rose
before
him
a
mental
picture
of
her
the
brightness
of
her
the
sunniness
the
indomitable
energy
and
pluck
and
courage
with
a
sudden
burst
of
new
determination
he
wadded
the
towel
into
a
moist
ball
flung
it
at
the
washstand
seized
hat
coat
and
gloves
and
was
off
down
the
hall
so
it
was
with
something
of
his
splendid
courage
in
his
heart
but
with
nothing
of
her
canny
knowledge
in
his
head
jock
mcchesney
fared
forth
to
do
battle
with
the
merciless
god
business
it
was
of
a
brilliant
morning
just
two
days
later
that
a
buoyant
young
figure
swung
into
an
elevator
in
the
great
office
building
that
housed
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
just
one
more
grain
of
buoyant
swing
and
the
young
man
walk
might
have
been
termed
a
swagger
as
it
was
his
walrus
bag
just
saved
him
stepping
out
of
the
lift
he
walked
as
from
habit
to
the
little
unlettered
door
which
admitted
employes
to
the
big
bright
inner
office
but
he
did
not
use
it
instead
he
turned
suddenly
and
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
double
door
which
led
into
the
reception
room
he
threw
out
his
legs
stiffly
and
came
down
rather
the
way
george
cohan
does
when
he
pleased
with
himself
in
the
second
act
mack
he
called
out
jovially
mack
the
usher
so
called
from
his
machiavellian
qualities
turned
to
survey
the
radiant
young
figure
before
him
good
morning
mcchesney
he
made
answer
smoothly
mack
never
forgot
himself
his
keen
eye
saw
the
little
halo
of
that
hovered
above
jock
mcchesney
head
a
successful
trip
i
see
jock
mcchesney
laughed
a
little
pleased
conscious
laugh
well
he
drawled
and
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
main
office
he
had
been
loath
to
lose
one
crumb
of
the
savor
of
it
illustration
he
drawled
still
smiling
he
walked
to
his
own
desk
with
a
nod
here
and
there
dropped
his
bag
took
off
coat
and
hat
selected
a
cigarette
tapped
it
smartly
lighted
it
and
was
off
down
the
big
room
to
the
little
at
the
other
end
but
sam
plump
keen
face
did
not
greet
him
as
he
entered
the
little
room
was
deserted
frowning
jock
sank
into
the
empty
desk
chair
he
cradled
his
head
in
his
hands
tilted
the
chair
pursed
his
mouth
over
the
slender
white
cylinder
and
squinted
his
eyes
up
toward
the
lazy
blue
spirals
of
smoke
the
very
picture
of
content
and
satisfaction
hupp
was
in
attending
some
conference
in
the
old
man
office
of
course
he
wished
they
hurry
the
business
of
the
week
was
being
there
those
conferences
were
great
cauldrons
into
which
the
day
business
or
the
week
was
dumped
to
be
boiled
simmered
stirred
skimmed
cooled
jock
had
never
been
privileged
to
attend
one
of
these
meetings
perhaps
by
this
time
next
week
he
might
have
a
spoon
in
the
stirring
too
there
came
the
murmur
of
voices
as
a
door
was
opened
the
voices
came
nearer
then
quick
footsteps
jock
recognized
them
he
rose
smiling
sam
hupp
vibrating
electric
energy
breezed
in
oh
hello
he
said
surprised
jock
smile
widened
to
a
grin
you
back
hello
hupp
he
said
coolly
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
omitted
the
prefix
you
just
bet
i
back
there
flashed
across
sam
hupp
face
a
curious
little
look
the
next
instant
it
was
gone
well
said
jock
and
took
a
long
breath
berg
wants
to
see
you
hupp
plunged
into
his
work
me
the
old
man
wants
to
see
me
yes
snapped
hupp
shortly
then
in
a
new
tone
look
here
son
if
he
says
he
stopped
and
turned
back
to
his
work
again
if
he
says
what
nothing
better
run
along
what
the
hurry
i
want
to
tell
you
about
better
tell
him
oh
all
right
said
jock
stiffly
if
that
was
the
way
they
treated
a
fellow
who
had
turned
his
first
real
trick
why
very
well
he
flung
out
of
the
little
room
and
made
straight
for
the
old
man
office
seated
at
his
great
flat
table
desk
bartholomew
berg
did
not
look
up
as
jock
entered
this
was
characteristic
of
the
old
man
everything
about
the
chief
was
deliberate
sure
unhurried
he
finished
the
work
in
hand
as
though
no
other
person
stood
there
waiting
his
pleasure
when
at
last
he
raised
his
massive
head
he
turned
his
penetrating
pale
blue
eyes
full
on
jock
jock
was
conscious
of
a
little
tremor
running
through
him
people
were
apt
to
experience
that
feeling
when
that
steady
unblinking
gaze
was
turned
upon
them
and
yet
it
was
just
the
clear
unwavering
look
with
which
bartholomew
berg
farmer
boy
had
been
wont
to
gaze
out
across
the
fields
to
the
horizon
beyond
which
lay
the
city
he
dreamed
about
tell
me
your
side
of
it
said
bartholomew
berg
tersely
all
of
it
jock
confidence
was
returning
till
i
stop
you
well
began
jock
and
standing
there
at
the
side
of
the
old
man
desk
his
legs
wide
apart
his
face
aglow
his
hands
on
his
hips
he
plunged
into
his
tale
it
started
off
with
a
bang
from
the
minute
i
walked
into
the
office
of
the
plant
and
met
snyder
the
advertising
manager
we
shook
hands
and
sparked
just
like
that
he
snapped
thumb
and
finger
what
do
you
think
we
belong
to
the
same
frat
he
inside
of
ten
minutes
he
and
i
were
around
like
mad
he
introduced
me
to
his
aunt
i
told
her
who
i
was
and
all
that
but
i
did
start
off
by
talking
business
we
got
along
from
the
jump
they
both
insisted
on
showing
me
through
the
place
i
well
he
laughed
a
little
ruefully
there
something
about
being
shown
through
a
factory
that
sort
of
paralyzes
my
brain
i
always
feel
that
i
ought
to
be
asking
keen
alert
intelligent
questions
like
the
ones
kipling
always
asks
or
the
japs
when
they
taken
through
the
stock
yards
but
i
never
can
think
of
any
well
we
did
talk
business
much
but
i
could
see
that
they
were
interested
they
seemed
to
he
faltered
and
blushed
a
little
to
like
me
you
know
i
played
golf
with
snyder
that
afternoon
and
he
beat
me
won
two
balls
the
next
morning
i
found
there
been
a
couple
of
other
advertising
men
there
and
while
i
was
talking
to
snyder
he
was
telling
me
about
the
time
he
climbed
up
and
muffled
the
chapel
bell
that
fellow
flynn
of
the
dowd
agency
came
in
snyder
excused
himself
and
talked
to
him
for
oh
half
an
hour
perhaps
but
that
was
all
he
was
back
again
in
no
time
after
that
it
looked
like
plain
sailing
we
got
along
wonderfully
when
i
left
i
said
expect
to
know
you
both
better
i
guess
interrupted
the
old
man
slowly
that
you
know
them
better
all
right
he
reached
out
with
one
broad
freckled
hand
and
turned
back
the
page
of
a
desk
memorandum
the
athena
account
was
given
to
the
dowd
advertising
agency
yesterday
it
took
jock
mcchesney
one
minute
one
long
sickening
minute
to
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
it
all
he
stared
at
the
massive
figure
before
him
his
mouth
ludicrously
open
his
eyes
round
his
breath
for
the
moment
suspended
then
in
a
queer
husky
voice
mean
the
dowd
but
they
could
i
mean
said
bartholomew
berg
that
you
scored
what
the
dramatic
critics
call
a
personal
hit
but
that
does
get
the
box
office
anything
but
berg
they
said
sit
down
a
minute
boy
he
waved
one
great
heavy
hand
toward
a
chair
his
eyes
were
not
fixed
on
jock
they
gazed
out
of
the
window
toward
the
great
white
tower
toward
which
hundreds
of
thousands
of
eyes
were
turned
daily
the
tower
but
faithful
mcchesney
do
you
know
why
you
fell
down
on
that
athena
account
because
i
an
idiot
blurted
jock
because
i
a
chump
and
that
one
reason
drawled
the
old
man
grimly
but
it
not
the
chief
one
the
real
reason
why
you
did
land
that
account
was
because
you
too
darned
charming
charming
jock
stared
just
that
personality
one
of
the
biggest
factors
in
business
but
there
are
some
men
who
are
so
likable
that
it
actually
counts
against
them
the
client
he
trying
to
convince
is
so
taken
with
him
that
he
actually
forgets
the
business
he
represents
we
say
of
a
man
like
that
that
he
is
personality
plus
personality
is
like
electricity
mcchesney
it
got
to
be
tamed
to
be
useful
but
i
thought
said
jock
miserably
that
the
idea
was
not
to
talk
business
all
the
time
you
got
it
agreed
berg
but
you
must
think
it
all
the
time
every
minute
it
got
to
be
working
away
in
the
back
of
your
head
you
know
it
is
always
the
biggest
noise
that
gets
the
biggest
result
the
great
american
hen
yields
a
bigger
income
than
the
steel
trust
look
at
miss
galt
when
we
have
a
job
that
needs
a
woman
eye
do
we
send
her
no
why
because
she
too
blame
charming
too
much
personality
a
man
just
naturally
refuses
to
talk
business
to
a
pretty
woman
unless
she
so
smart
that
my
mother
interrupted
jock
suddenly
and
then
stopped
surprised
at
himself
your
mother
said
bartholomew
berg
slowly
is
one
woman
in
a
million
do
ever
forget
that
they
do
turn
out
models
like
emma
mcchesney
more
than
once
every
blue
moon
jock
got
to
his
feet
slowly
he
felt
heavy
old
i
suppose
he
began
that
this
ends
my
my
advertising
career
ends
it
the
old
man
stood
up
and
put
a
heavy
hand
on
the
shoulder
it
only
begins
it
unless
you
want
to
lie
down
and
quit
do
you
quit
cried
jock
mcchesney
quit
not
on
your
white
space
good
said
bartholomew
berg
and
took
jock
mcchesney
hand
in
his
own
great
friendly
grasp
an
instinct
as
strong
as
that
which
had
made
him
blatant
in
his
hour
of
triumph
now
caused
him
to
avoid
in
his
hour
of
defeat
the
before
whom
he
would
fain
be
a
hero
he
avoided
grace
galt
all
that
long
dreary
afternoon
he
thought
wildly
of
staying
for
the
evening
of
putting
off
the
meeting
with
his
mother
of
avoiding
the
dreaded
explanations
excuses
confessions
but
when
he
let
himself
into
the
flat
at
the
place
was
very
quiet
except
for
annie
humming
in
a
sort
of
nasal
singsong
of
content
in
the
kitchen
he
flicked
on
the
light
in
the
a
new
magazine
had
come
it
lay
on
the
table
its
bright
cover
staring
up
invitingly
he
ran
through
its
pages
by
force
of
habit
he
turned
to
the
back
pages
ads
started
back
at
him
clothing
ads
paint
ads
motor
ads
ads
of
portable
houses
and
vacuum
cleaners
and
toilette
preparations
he
shut
the
magazine
with
a
vicious
slap
he
flicked
off
the
light
again
for
no
reason
except
that
he
seemed
to
like
the
dusk
in
his
own
bedroom
it
was
very
quiet
he
turned
on
the
light
there
too
then
turned
it
off
he
sat
down
at
the
edge
of
his
bed
how
was
it
in
the
stories
oh
yes
the
cub
always
started
out
on
an
impossibly
difficult
business
stunt
and
came
back
triumphant
to
be
made
a
member
of
the
firm
at
once
a
vision
of
his
own
roseate
hopes
and
dreams
rose
up
before
him
it
grew
very
dark
in
the
little
room
then
altogether
dark
then
an
impudent
square
of
yellow
from
a
light
turned
on
in
the
apartment
next
door
flung
itself
on
the
bedroom
floor
jock
stared
at
it
moodily
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
a
door
opened
and
shut
a
quick
step
then
jock
a
light
flashed
in
the
jock
sat
up
suddenly
he
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
there
issued
from
his
throat
a
strange
and
absurd
little
croak
jock
home
yes
answered
jock
and
straightened
up
but
before
he
could
flick
on
his
own
light
his
mother
stood
in
the
doorway
a
tall
straight
buoyant
figure
i
got
your
wire
and
why
dear
in
the
dark
what
must
have
fallen
asleep
i
guess
muttered
jock
somehow
he
dreaded
to
turn
on
the
lights
and
then
very
quietly
emma
mcchesney
came
in
she
found
him
there
in
the
dark
as
surely
as
a
mother
bear
finds
her
cubs
in
a
cave
she
sat
down
beside
him
at
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
brought
his
head
down
gently
to
her
breast
and
at
that
the
room
which
had
been
a
man
room
with
its
pipe
its
tobacco
jar
its
tie
rack
filled
with
cravats
of
fascinating
shapes
and
hues
became
all
at
once
a
boy
room
again
and
the
man
sitting
there
with
straight
strong
shoulders
and
his
little
air
of
worldliness
became
in
some
miraculous
way
a
little
boy
again
illustration
became
in
some
miraculous
way
a
little
boy
again
iii
dictated
but
not
read
about
the
time
that
jock
mcchesney
began
to
carry
a
yellow
down
to
work
each
morning
his
mother
noticed
a
growing
tendency
on
his
part
to
patronize
her
now
emma
mcchesney
successful
capable
business
woman
that
she
was
could
afford
to
regard
her
young
son
attitude
with
a
quiet
and
deep
amusement
in
twelve
years
emma
mcchesney
had
risen
from
the
humble
position
of
stenographer
in
the
office
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
to
the
secretaryship
of
the
firm
so
when
her
young
son
backed
by
the
profound
business
knowledge
gained
in
his
one
year
with
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
hinted
gently
that
her
methods
and
training
were
archaic
ineffectual
and
lacking
in
those
twin
condiments
known
to
the
twentieth
century
as
pep
and
ginger
she
would
listen
eyebrows
raised
lower
lip
caught
between
her
teeth
a
trick
which
gives
a
distorted
expression
to
the
features
calculated
to
hide
any
lurking
tendency
to
grin
besides
though
emma
mcchesney
was
forty
she
looked
as
business
women
do
and
knew
it
her
life
had
brought
her
in
contact
with
people
and
things
and
events
and
had
kept
her
young
illustration
jock
mcchesney
began
to
carry
a
yellow
down
to
work
thank
fortune
mcchesney
often
said
that
i
was
cursed
with
a
life
of
ease
these
women
always
look
such
hags
at
but
repetition
will
ruin
the
rarest
of
jokes
as
the
weeks
went
on
and
jock
attitude
persisted
the
twinkle
in
emma
mcchesney
eye
died
the
glow
of
growing
resentment
began
to
burn
in
its
place
now
and
then
there
crept
into
her
eyes
a
little
look
of
doubt
and
bewilderment
you
sometimes
see
that
same
little
shocked
dazed
expression
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
whose
husband
has
just
said
is
that
hat
too
young
for
you
then
one
evening
emma
mcchesney
resentment
flared
into
open
revolt
she
had
announced
that
she
intended
to
rise
half
an
hour
earlier
each
morning
in
order
that
she
might
walk
a
brisk
mile
or
so
on
her
way
before
taking
the
subway
but
wo
it
tire
you
too
much
mother
jock
had
asked
with
maddeningly
tender
solicitude
his
mother
color
heightened
her
blue
eyes
glowed
dark
look
here
jock
will
you
kindly
stop
this
stuff
to
hear
you
talk
one
would
think
i
was
ready
for
a
wheel
chair
and
gray
woolen
bedroom
slippers
why
i
did
mean
i
only
thought
that
perhaps
overexertion
in
a
woman
of
your
that
is
you
need
your
energy
for
do
wallow
around
in
it
snapped
emma
mcchesney
you
only
sink
in
deeper
in
your
efforts
to
crawl
out
i
merely
want
to
warn
you
that
if
you
persist
in
this
pose
of
tender
solicitude
for
your
doddering
old
mother
i
i
present
you
with
a
stepfather
a
year
younger
than
you
do
laugh
perhaps
you
think
i
do
it
good
lord
mother
of
course
you
do
mean
it
but
mean
it
cleverer
women
than
i
have
been
driven
by
their
children
to
marrying
in
i
warn
you
illustration
lord
mother
of
course
you
mean
it
but
that
stopped
it
for
a
while
jock
ceased
to
bestow
upon
his
mother
judicious
advice
from
the
vast
storehouse
of
his
own
experience
he
refrained
from
breaking
out
with
elaborate
advertising
schemes
whereby
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
might
grind
every
other
skirt
concern
to
dust
he
gave
only
a
startled
look
when
his
mother
mischievously
suggested
raspberry
as
the
color
for
her
new
autumn
suit
then
quite
suddenly
circumstance
caught
emma
mcchesney
in
the
meshes
and
before
she
had
fought
her
way
free
wrought
trouble
and
change
upon
her
jock
mcchesney
was
seated
in
the
window
of
his
mother
office
at
noon
of
a
brilliant
autumn
day
a
little
impatient
frown
was
forming
between
his
eyes
he
wanted
his
luncheon
he
had
called
around
expressly
to
take
his
mother
out
to
luncheon
always
a
festive
occasion
when
taken
together
but
mcchesney
seated
at
her
desk
was
bent
absorbedly
over
a
sheet
of
paper
whereon
she
was
adding
up
two
columns
of
figures
at
a
time
a
trick
on
which
she
rather
prided
herself
she
was
counting
aloud
her
mind
leaping
agilely
thus
eleven
sixty
her
pencil
came
down
on
the
desk
with
a
thwack
she
repeated
in
capital
letters
she
turned
around
to
face
jock
her
voice
bristled
with
indignation
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
think
you
better
make
it
an
even
seventy
whatever
it
is
you
counting
up
and
come
on
out
to
luncheon
i
an
appointment
at
you
know
luncheon
she
waved
the
paper
in
the
air
with
this
outrage
on
my
mind
nectar
would
curdle
in
my
system
jock
rose
and
strolled
lazily
over
to
the
desk
what
is
it
he
glanced
idly
at
the
sheet
of
paper
what
mcchesney
pressed
a
buzzer
at
the
side
of
her
desk
dollars
that
what
representing
two
days
expenses
in
the
six
weeks
missionary
trip
that
fat
ed
meyers
just
made
for
us
and
in
iowa
too
when
you
gave
that
fellow
the
job
began
jock
hotly
i
told
you
and
buck
told
you
that
mcchesney
interrupted
wearily
yes
i
know
you
never
have
a
grander
chance
to
say
told
you
so
i
hired
him
because
he
was
out
of
a
job
and
we
needed
a
man
who
knew
the
trade
and
then
because
well
poor
fellow
he
begged
so
and
promised
to
keep
straight
as
though
i
ought
to
know
that
a
traveling
man
can
never
be
anything
but
a
traveling
man
the
office
door
opened
as
there
appeared
in
answer
to
the
buzzer
a
very
alert
very
smiling
and
very
tidy
office
girl
emma
mcchesney
had
tried
office
boys
and
found
them
wanting
tell
meyers
i
want
to
see
him
just
going
out
to
lunch
she
turned
like
a
race
horse
trembling
to
be
off
putting
on
his
overcoat
in
the
front
office
shall
i
catch
him
listen
here
began
jock
uncomfortably
if
you
going
to
call
him
perhaps
i
better
vanish
to
save
ed
meyers
tender
feelings
you
do
know
him
fat
ed
meyers
could
be
courtmartialed
tried
convicted
and
publicly
disgraced
with
his
epaulets
torn
off
and
his
sword
broken
and
likely
as
not
he
stoop
down
pick
up
a
splinter
of
steel
to
use
as
a
toothpick
and
castlewalk
down
the
aisle
to
the
tune
with
which
they
were
drumming
him
out
of
the
regiment
stay
right
here
meyers
explanation
ought
to
be
at
least
amusing
if
not
educating
in
the
corridor
outside
could
be
heard
some
one
blithely
humming
in
the
throaty
tenor
of
the
fat
man
the
humming
ceased
with
a
last
high
note
as
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
fat
ed
meyers
rosy
cherubic
smiling
his
huge
frame
looming
mountainous
in
the
rippling
folds
of
a
london
plaid
topcoat
greetings
boomed
this
cheery
vision
raising
one
hand
palm
outward
in
mystic
salute
he
beamed
upon
the
frowning
jock
how
the
infant
prodigy
the
fact
that
jock
frown
deepened
to
a
scowl
ruffled
him
not
at
all
and
what
went
on
he
crossing
his
feet
and
leaning
negligently
against
mcchesney
desk
and
what
can
i
do
for
thee
fair
lady
illustration
for
me
said
emma
mcchesney
looking
up
at
him
through
narrowed
eyelids
i
tell
you
what
you
can
explain
to
me
in
what
they
call
a
few
words
just
how
you
or
any
other
living
creature
could
manage
to
turn
in
an
expense
account
like
that
on
a
missionary
trip
through
the
middle
west
dear
lady
in
the
bland
tones
that
one
uses
to
an
unreasonable
child
you
will
need
no
explanation
if
you
will
just
remember
to
lay
the
stress
on
the
word
missionary
i
went
forth
through
the
middle
west
to
spread
the
light
among
the
benighted
skirt
trade
this
was
a
selling
trip
dear
lady
it
was
a
buying
expedition
and
i
had
to
buy
did
i
all
the
way
from
michigan
to
indiana
he
smiled
down
at
her
calm
impudent
a
little
flush
grew
in
emma
mcchesney
cheeks
i
always
said
she
began
crisply
that
one
could
pretty
well
judge
a
man
character
temperament
morals
and
physical
by
just
glancing
at
his
expense
account
the
trouble
with
you
is
that
you
have
learned
the
art
of
spending
money
wisely
it
is
always
the
man
with
the
largest
expense
sheet
that
gets
the
most
business
and
it
is
the
man
who
leaves
the
greatest
number
of
circles
on
the
table
top
in
his
hotel
room
either
she
paused
a
moment
ed
meyers
smile
had
lost
some
of
its
heartiness
buck
out
of
town
as
you
know
he
be
back
next
week
he
was
in
favor
of
now
mcchesney
interrupted
ed
meyers
nervously
you
know
there
always
one
live
one
in
every
firm
just
like
always
one
star
in
every
family
you
the
i
the
one
who
wants
to
know
how
you
could
spend
dollars
for
two
days
incidentals
in
iowa
iowa
why
look
here
ed
meyers
i
made
iowa
for
ten
years
when
i
was
on
the
road
you
know
that
and
you
know
and
i
know
that
in
order
to
spend
dollars
for
incidentals
in
two
days
in
iowa
you
have
to
call
out
the
militia
not
when
you
trying
to
win
the
love
of
every
skirt
buyer
from
sioux
city
to
des
moines
emma
mcchesney
rose
impatiently
oh
that
nonsense
you
need
to
do
that
these
days
those
are
methods
they
out
of
date
they
at
that
a
little
sound
came
from
jock
emma
heard
it
glanced
at
him
turned
away
again
in
confusion
i
was
foolish
enough
in
the
first
place
to
give
you
this
job
for
old
times
sake
she
continued
hurriedly
fat
ed
meyers
face
drooped
dolefully
he
cocked
his
round
head
on
one
side
fatuously
for
old
times
sake
he
repeated
with
tremulous
pathos
and
heaved
a
gusty
sigh
which
goes
to
show
that
i
need
a
guardian
finished
emma
mcchesney
cruelly
the
only
old
times
that
i
can
remember
are
when
i
was
selling
featherlooms
and
you
were
out
for
the
skirt
company
both
covering
the
same
territory
and
both
running
a
race
to
see
which
could
beat
the
other
at
his
own
game
the
only
difference
was
that
i
always
played
fair
while
you
played
whenever
you
had
a
chance
now
my
dear
mcchesney
that
be
all
said
emma
mcchesney
as
one
whose
patience
is
fast
slipping
away
buck
will
see
you
next
week
then
turning
to
her
son
as
the
door
closed
on
the
drooping
figure
of
the
erstwhile
buoyant
meyers
where
we
lunch
jock
mother
jock
broke
out
hotly
why
in
the
name
of
all
foolish
do
you
persist
in
using
the
methods
of
methuselah
people
do
sell
goods
any
more
by
sending
out
fat
old
men
to
jolly
up
the
trade
jock
repeated
emma
mcchesney
slowly
where
shall
we
lunch
it
was
a
grim
little
meal
eaten
almost
in
silence
emma
mcchesney
had
made
it
a
rule
to
use
luncheon
time
as
a
recess
she
played
mental
tag
and
so
that
returning
to
her
office
refreshed
in
mind
and
body
she
could
attack
the
afternoon
work
with
new
vigor
and
never
did
she
talk
or
think
business
she
ate
her
luncheon
with
a
forced
appetite
glanced
about
with
a
listlessness
far
removed
from
her
usual
alert
interest
and
followed
jock
attempts
at
conversation
with
a
polite
effort
that
was
more
insulting
than
downright
inattention
dessert
mother
jock
had
to
say
it
twice
before
she
heard
what
oh
no
i
think
not
the
waiter
hesitated
coughed
discreetly
lifted
his
eyebrows
insinuatingly
the
french
pastry
particularly
nice
madam
if
you
care
to
try
something
eclair
madam
peach
tart
mocha
tart
caramel
emma
mcchesney
smiled
it
does
sound
tempting
she
glanced
at
jock
and
we
wearing
our
gowns
so
floppy
this
year
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
one
fat
or
not
she
turned
to
the
waiter
i
never
can
tell
till
i
see
them
bring
your
pastry
tray
will
you
jock
mcchesney
finger
and
thumb
came
together
with
a
snap
he
leaned
across
the
table
toward
his
mother
eyes
glowing
lips
parted
and
eager
there
you
proved
my
point
point
about
advertising
no
do
stop
me
do
you
see
that
what
applies
to
pastry
applies
to
petticoats
you
did
think
of
french
pastry
until
he
suggested
it
to
you
advertised
it
really
and
then
you
wanted
a
picture
of
them
you
wanted
to
know
what
they
looked
like
before
buying
that
all
there
is
to
advertising
telling
people
about
a
thing
making
want
it
and
showing
how
it
will
look
when
they
have
it
get
me
emma
mcchesney
was
gazing
at
jock
with
a
curious
fascinated
stare
it
was
a
blank
little
look
such
as
we
sometimes
wear
when
the
mind
is
working
furiously
if
the
insinuating
waiter
presenting
the
laden
tray
for
her
inspection
was
startled
by
the
rapt
expression
which
she
turned
upon
the
cunningly
wrought
wares
he
was
too
much
a
waiter
to
show
it
a
pause
that
one
said
mcchesney
pointing
to
the
least
ornate
she
ate
it
down
to
the
last
crumb
in
a
silence
that
was
pregnant
with
portent
she
put
down
her
fork
and
sat
back
jock
you
win
i
i
suppose
i
have
fallen
out
of
step
perhaps
i
been
too
busy
watching
my
own
feet
will
be
back
next
week
could
your
office
have
an
advertising
plan
roughly
sketched
by
that
time
could
they
his
tone
was
exultant
watch
hupp
been
crazy
to
make
featherlooms
famous
but
look
here
son
i
want
a
hand
in
that
copy
i
know
featherlooms
better
than
your
sam
hupp
will
ever
jock
shook
his
head
they
wo
stand
for
that
mother
it
never
works
the
manufacturer
always
thinks
he
can
write
magic
stuff
because
he
knows
his
own
product
but
he
never
can
you
see
he
knows
too
much
that
it
no
perspective
we
see
said
emma
mcchesney
curtly
so
it
was
that
ten
days
later
the
first
important
conference
in
the
interests
of
the
featherloom
petticoat
company
advertising
campaign
was
called
but
in
those
ten
days
of
hurried
preparation
a
little
silent
tragedy
had
come
about
for
the
first
time
in
her
brave
sunny
life
emma
mcchesney
had
lost
faith
in
herself
and
with
such
malicious
humor
does
fate
work
her
will
that
she
chose
sam
hupp
new
dictagraph
as
the
instrument
with
which
to
prick
the
bubble
of
mcchesney
sam
hupp
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
berg
shriner
firm
had
a
trick
of
forgetting
to
shut
off
certain
necessary
currents
when
he
paused
in
his
dictation
to
throw
in
conversational
asides
the
old
and
experienced
stenographers
had
learned
to
look
out
for
that
and
to
eliminate
from
their
typewritten
letters
certain
irrelevant
and
sometimes
irreverent
asides
which
sam
hupp
evidently
had
addressed
to
his
pipe
or
the
office
boy
and
not
intended
for
the
tube
of
the
dictagraph
there
was
a
new
and
nervous
little
stenographer
in
the
outer
office
and
she
had
not
been
warned
of
this
we
think
very
highly
of
the
plan
you
suggest
sam
hupp
had
said
into
the
dictagraph
mouthpiece
in
fact
in
one
of
your
valuable
copy
suggestions
you
without
changing
his
tone
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
his
colleague
hopper
who
was
listening
and
approving
let
the
old
girl
think
the
idea
is
her
own
she
virtually
the
head
of
that
concern
and
they
spoiled
her
successful
and
used
to
being
kowtowed
to
does
know
her
notions
of
copy
are
ten
years
behind
the
advertising
game
and
went
on
with
his
letter
again
after
which
he
left
the
office
to
play
golf
and
the
little
blond
numbskull
in
the
outer
office
dutifully
took
down
what
the
instrument
had
to
say
word
for
word
marked
it
dictated
but
not
read
signed
neat
initials
and
with
a
sigh
went
on
with
the
rest
of
her
sheaf
of
letters
emma
mcchesney
read
the
letter
next
morning
she
read
it
down
to
the
end
and
then
again
the
two
readings
were
punctuated
with
a
little
gasp
such
as
we
give
when
an
icy
douche
is
suddenly
turned
upon
us
and
that
was
all
a
week
later
an
intent
little
group
formed
a
ragged
circle
about
the
big
table
in
the
private
office
of
bartholomew
berg
head
of
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
bartholomew
berg
himself
massive
watchful
taciturn
managing
to
give
an
impression
of
power
by
his
very
silence
sat
at
one
side
of
the
long
table
just
across
from
him
a
stenographer
bent
over
her
note
book
jotting
down
every
word
that
the
conference
might
make
business
history
hopper
at
one
end
of
the
room
studied
his
shoe
heel
intently
he
was
unbelievably
boyish
looking
to
command
the
fabulous
salary
reported
to
be
his
advertising
men
mentioning
his
name
pulled
a
figurative
forelock
as
they
did
so
near
mcchesney
sat
sam
hupp
he
of
the
lightning
brain
and
the
copy
emma
mcchesney
strangely
silent
kept
her
eyes
intent
on
the
faces
of
the
others
buck
interested
enthusiastic
but
somewhat
uncertain
glanced
now
and
then
at
his
silent
business
partner
found
no
satisfaction
in
her
set
face
and
glanced
away
again
grace
galt
unbelievably
young
and
pretty
to
have
won
a
place
for
herself
in
that
conference
of
business
people
smiled
in
secret
at
jock
mcchesney
evident
struggle
to
conceal
his
elation
at
being
present
at
this
his
first
staff
meeting
the
conference
had
lasted
one
hour
now
in
that
time
featherloom
petticoats
had
been
picked
to
pieces
bit
by
bit
from
hem
to
nothing
had
been
left
untouched
every
angle
had
come
under
the
keen
vision
of
the
advertising
experts
the
comfort
of
the
garment
its
durability
style
cheapness
service
which
to
emphasize
h
m
novelty
campaign
in
my
opinion
said
hopper
breaking
one
of
his
long
silences
there
nothing
new
in
petticoats
themselves
you
know
you
got
to
give
a
new
angle
yep
agreed
hupp
start
out
with
a
feature
skirt
might
illustrate
with
one
of
those
freak
drawings
they
crazy
about
now
slinky
figure
you
know
one
foot
trailing
and
all
that
they
crazy
but
they
do
attract
attention
no
doubt
of
that
bartholomew
berg
turned
his
head
slowly
what
your
opinion
mrs
mcchesney
he
asked
i
i
afraid
i
have
any
said
emma
mcchesney
listlessly
buck
stared
at
her
in
dismay
and
amazement
how
about
you
mr
buck
why
i
er
of
course
this
advertising
game
new
to
me
really
leaving
it
in
your
hands
i
really
thought
that
mcchesney
idea
was
to
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
these
petticoats
were
not
freak
petticoats
but
skirts
for
the
everyday
women
she
gave
me
what
i
thought
was
a
splendid
argument
a
week
ago
he
turned
to
her
helplessly
mcchesney
sat
silent
bartholomew
berg
leaned
forward
a
little
and
smiled
one
of
his
rare
smiles
wo
you
tell
us
mcchesney
we
all
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
mcchesney
looked
down
at
her
hands
then
she
looked
up
and
addressed
what
she
had
to
say
straight
to
bartholomew
berg
i
simply
did
want
to
interfere
in
this
business
i
know
nothing
about
it
really
of
course
i
do
know
featherloom
petticoats
i
know
all
about
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
just
because
the
newspapers
and
magazines
were
full
of
pictures
showing
spectacular
creatures
in
impossible
attitudes
wearing
tango
tea
skirts
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
those
types
form
only
a
thin
upper
crust
and
that
down
beneath
there
are
millions
and
millions
of
regular
everyday
women
doing
regular
everyday
things
in
regular
everyday
clothes
women
who
wash
on
monday
and
iron
on
tuesday
and
bake
cakes
and
who
have
to
hurry
home
to
get
supper
when
they
go
in
the
afternoon
they
the
kind
who
go
to
market
every
morning
and
take
the
baby
along
in
the
and
they
not
wearing
crêpe
de
chine
tango
petticoats
to
do
it
in
either
they
wearing
skirts
with
a
drawstring
in
the
back
and
a
label
in
the
band
guaranteed
to
last
one
year
those
are
the
people
i
like
to
reach
and
hold
hm
said
hopper
from
his
corner
cryptically
bartholomew
berg
looked
at
emma
mcchesney
admiringly
sounds
reasonable
and
logical
he
said
sam
hupp
sat
up
with
a
jerk
it
does
sound
reasonable
he
said
briskly
but
it
is
pardon
me
wo
you
mcchesney
but
you
must
realize
that
this
is
an
extravagant
age
the
very
workingmen
wives
have
caught
the
spending
fever
the
time
is
past
when
you
can
attract
people
to
your
goods
with
the
promise
of
durability
and
wear
they
expect
goods
to
wear
they
resent
it
if
they
did
they
get
tired
of
an
article
before
it
worn
out
they
looking
for
novelties
they
rather
get
two
months
wear
out
of
a
skirt
that
slashed
a
new
way
than
a
year
wear
out
of
one
that
looks
like
the
sort
that
mother
used
to
make
mcchesney
her
cheeks
very
pink
her
eyes
very
bright
subsided
into
silence
in
silence
she
sat
throughout
the
rest
of
the
conference
in
silence
she
descended
in
the
elevator
with
buck
and
in
silence
she
stepped
into
his
waiting
car
buck
eyed
her
worriedly
well
he
said
then
as
mcchesney
shrugged
noncommittal
shoulders
tell
me
how
do
you
feel
about
it
emma
mcchesney
turned
to
face
him
breathing
rather
quickly
the
last
time
i
felt
as
i
do
just
now
was
when
jock
was
a
baby
he
took
sick
and
the
doctors
were
puzzled
they
thought
it
might
be
something
wrong
with
his
spine
they
had
a
consultation
five
of
them
with
the
poor
little
chap
on
the
bed
naked
they
would
let
me
in
so
i
listened
in
the
hallway
pressed
against
the
door
with
my
face
to
the
crack
they
prodded
him
and
poked
him
and
worked
his
little
legs
and
arms
and
every
time
he
cried
i
prayed
and
wept
and
clawed
the
door
with
my
fingers
and
called
them
beasts
and
torturers
and
begged
them
to
let
me
in
though
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
doing
those
things
at
the
time
i
did
know
what
they
were
doing
to
him
though
they
said
it
was
all
for
his
good
and
they
were
only
trying
to
help
him
but
i
only
knew
that
i
wanted
to
rush
in
and
grab
him
up
in
my
arms
and
run
away
with
him
run
and
run
and
run
she
stopped
lips
trembling
eyes
suspiciously
bright
and
that
the
way
i
felt
in
there
this
afternoon
buck
reached
up
and
patted
her
shoulder
do
old
girl
it
going
to
work
out
splendidly
i
sure
after
all
those
chaps
do
know
best
they
may
know
best
but
they
do
know
featherlooms
retorted
emma
mcchesney
true
but
perhaps
what
jock
said
when
he
walked
with
us
to
the
elevator
was
pretty
nearly
right
you
know
he
said
we
were
criticising
their
copy
the
way
a
plumber
would
criticise
the
parthenon
so
busy
finding
fault
with
the
lack
of
drains
that
we
failed
to
see
the
beauty
of
the
architecture
said
emma
mcchesney
solemnly
we
getting
old
old
you
i
ha
you
may
all
you
like
but
do
you
know
what
they
thought
of
us
in
there
they
thought
we
were
a
couple
of
fogies
and
they
humored
us
that
what
they
did
i
tell
you
when
the
time
comes
for
me
to
give
jock
up
to
some
little
girl
i
do
it
and
smile
if
it
kills
me
but
to
hand
my
featherlooms
over
to
a
lot
of
experts
who
well
she
paused
biting
her
lip
we
see
emma
we
see
they
did
see
the
featherloom
petticoat
campaign
was
launched
with
a
great
splash
it
sailed
serenely
into
the
sea
of
national
business
then
suddenly
something
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
its
engines
it
began
to
wobble
and
showed
a
decided
list
to
port
jock
who
at
the
beginning
was
so
puffed
with
pride
that
his
gold
fountain
pen
threatened
to
burst
the
confines
of
his
very
modishly
tight
vest
lost
two
degrees
of
pompousness
a
day
and
his
attitude
toward
his
unreproachful
mother
was
almost
humble
a
dozen
times
a
week
buck
would
stroll
casually
into
mcchesney
office
think
it
going
to
take
hold
he
would
ask
our
men
say
the
dealers
have
laid
in
but
the
public
does
seem
to
be
tearing
itself
limb
from
limb
to
get
to
our
stuff
emma
mcchesney
would
smile
and
shrug
noncommittal
shoulders
when
it
became
very
painfully
apparent
that
it
was
taking
hold
buck
after
asking
the
same
question
now
worn
and
frayed
with
asking
broke
out
crossly
well
really
i
do
mind
the
shrug
but
i
do
wish
you
smile
after
all
you
know
this
campaign
is
costing
us
money
real
money
and
large
chunks
of
it
it
very
evident
that
we
should
have
tried
to
make
a
national
campaign
of
this
thing
whereupon
mcchesney
smile
grew
into
a
laugh
forgive
me
i
not
laughing
at
you
i
laughing
because
well
i
tell
you
why
it
a
woman
reason
and
you
would
think
it
a
reason
at
all
for
that
matter
i
suppose
it
is
but
anyway
i
got
something
to
tell
you
the
fault
of
this
campaign
has
been
the
copy
it
was
perfectly
good
advertising
but
it
left
the
public
cold
when
they
read
those
ads
they
might
have
been
impressed
with
the
charm
of
the
garment
but
it
did
fill
their
breasts
with
any
wild
longing
to
possess
one
it
did
make
the
women
feel
unhappy
until
they
had
one
of
those
skirts
hanging
on
the
third
hook
in
their
closet
the
only
kind
of
advertising
that
is
advertising
is
the
kind
that
makes
the
reader
say
have
one
of
those
buck
threw
out
helpless
hands
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
do
i
already
done
it
done
what
written
the
kind
of
copy
that
i
think
featherlooms
ought
to
have
i
just
took
my
knowledge
of
featherlooms
plus
what
i
knew
about
human
nature
sprinkled
in
a
handful
of
good
humor
and
sincerity
and
they
going
to
feed
it
to
the
public
it
the
same
recipe
that
i
used
to
use
in
selling
featherlooms
on
the
road
it
used
to
go
by
word
of
mouth
i
do
see
why
it
should
go
on
paper
it
is
classic
advertising
it
is
scientific
it
is
even
what
they
call
psychological
i
suppose
but
it
human
and
it
going
to
reach
that
great
big
solid
safe
mass
known
as
the
middle
class
of
course
my
copy
may
be
wrong
it
may
not
go
after
all
but
but
it
did
go
it
did
go
with
a
rush
or
a
bang
it
went
slowly
surely
hand
over
hand
but
it
went
and
it
kept
on
going
and
watching
it
climb
and
take
hold
there
came
back
to
emma
mcchesney
eye
the
old
sparkle
to
her
step
the
old
buoyancy
to
her
voice
the
old
delightful
ring
and
now
when
buck
strolled
into
her
office
of
a
morning
with
his
it
taking
hold
mack
she
would
dimple
like
a
girl
as
she
laughed
back
at
him
with
a
grip
that
wo
let
go
it
looks
very
much
as
though
we
were
going
to
be
millionaires
in
our
old
age
you
and
i
went
on
buck
emma
mcchesney
opened
her
eyes
wide
old
she
mocked
old
you
i
ha
iv
the
man
within
him
they
used
to
do
it
much
more
picturesquely
they
rode
in
coats
of
scarlet
in
the
crisp
clear
morning
to
the
winding
of
horns
and
the
baying
of
hounds
to
the
of
hoofs
and
the
crackle
of
underbrush
across
fields
they
went
crashing
through
forest
paths
leaping
ditches
taking
fences
scrambling
up
the
inclines
pelting
down
the
hillside
until
panting
eager
the
hunt
closed
in
at
the
death
the
scarlet
coat
has
sobered
down
to
the
somber
gray
and
the
snuffy
brown
of
that
unromantic
garment
known
as
the
business
suit
the
winding
horn
is
become
a
goblet
and
its
notes
are
the
tinkle
of
ice
against
glass
the
baying
of
hounds
has
harshened
to
the
squawk
of
the
motor
siren
the
field
is
a
blue
print
the
forest
maze
a
roll
of
plans
and
specifications
each
fence
is
a
business
barrier
every
ditch
is
of
a
making
dug
craftily
so
that
the
may
come
a
cropper
all
the
romance
is
out
of
it
all
the
color
all
the
joy
but
two
things
remain
the
same
the
look
in
the
face
of
the
hunter
as
he
closed
in
on
the
fox
is
the
look
in
the
face
of
him
who
sees
the
coveted
contract
lying
ready
for
the
finishing
stroke
of
his
pen
and
his
words
are
those
of
the
hunter
of
long
ago
as
eyes
teeth
bared
muscles
still
taut
with
the
tenseness
of
the
chase
he
waves
the
paper
high
in
air
and
cries
i
made
a
killing
for
two
years
jock
mcchesney
had
watched
the
field
as
it
swept
by
in
its
patient
devious
cruel
game
of
hunt
the
contract
but
he
had
never
been
in
at
the
death
those
two
years
had
taught
him
how
to
ride
to
take
a
fence
to
leap
a
ditch
he
had
had
his
awkward
bumps
and
his
clumsy
falls
he
had
lost
his
way
more
than
once
but
he
had
always
groped
his
way
back
again
stumblingly
through
the
dusk
jock
mcchesney
was
the
youngest
man
on
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
big
staff
of
surprisingly
young
men
so
young
that
the
casual
glance
did
not
reveal
to
you
the
marks
that
the
strain
of
those
two
years
had
left
on
his
boyish
face
but
the
marks
were
there
nature
etches
with
the
most
delicate
of
points
she
knows
the
cunning
secret
of
light
and
shadow
you
scarcely
realize
that
she
has
been
at
work
a
faint
line
about
the
mouth
a
fairy
tracing
at
the
corners
of
the
eyes
a
mere
vague
touch
just
at
the
nostrils
and
the
thing
is
done
even
emma
mcchesney
eyes
those
which
make
the
lynx
seem
a
mole
had
failed
to
note
the
subtle
change
then
suddenly
one
night
the
lines
leaped
out
at
her
they
were
seated
at
opposite
sides
of
the
library
table
in
the
of
the
cheerful
apartment
which
was
the
realization
of
the
nightly
dream
which
emma
mcchesney
had
had
in
her
ten
years
on
the
road
for
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
jock
mcchesney
side
of
the
big
table
was
completely
covered
with
the
mass
of
rough
sketches
photographs
and
drawings
which
make
up
an
advertising
he
was
bent
over
the
work
absorbed
intent
his
forearms
resting
on
the
table
emma
mcchesney
glanced
up
from
her
magazine
just
as
jock
bent
forward
to
reach
a
scrap
of
paper
that
had
fluttered
away
the
lamplight
fell
full
on
his
face
and
emma
mcchesney
saw
the
hand
that
held
the
magazine
fell
to
her
lap
her
lips
were
parted
slightly
she
sat
very
quietly
her
eyes
never
leaving
the
face
that
frowned
so
intently
over
the
littered
table
the
room
had
been
very
quiet
before
jock
busy
with
his
work
his
mother
interested
in
her
magazine
but
this
silence
was
different
there
was
something
electric
in
it
it
was
a
silence
that
beats
on
the
brain
like
a
noise
jock
mcchesney
bent
over
his
work
heard
it
felt
it
and
oppressed
by
it
looked
up
suddenly
he
met
those
two
eyes
opposite
spooks
or
is
it
my
godlike
beauty
which
holds
you
thus
or
is
my
face
dirty
emma
mcchesney
did
not
smile
she
laid
her
magazine
on
the
table
face
down
and
leaned
forward
her
staring
eyes
still
fixed
on
her
son
face
look
here
young
are
you
working
too
hard
me
now
this
stuff
you
mean
no
i
mean
in
the
last
year
are
they
piling
it
up
on
you
jock
laughed
a
laugh
that
was
nothing
less
than
a
failure
so
little
of
real
mirth
did
it
contain
piling
it
up
lord
no
i
wish
they
would
that
the
trouble
they
do
give
me
a
chance
a
chance
why
that
not
true
son
you
said
yourself
that
there
are
men
who
have
been
in
the
office
three
times
as
long
as
you
have
who
never
have
had
the
opportunities
that
they
given
you
it
was
as
though
she
had
touched
a
current
that
thrilled
him
to
action
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
one
hand
thrust
into
his
pocket
the
other
passing
quickly
over
his
head
from
brow
to
nape
with
a
quick
nervous
gesture
that
was
new
to
him
and
why
he
flung
out
why
not
because
they
like
the
way
i
part
my
hair
they
do
do
business
that
way
up
there
because
i
made
good
and
those
other
dubs
have
that
why
they
let
me
sit
in
at
the
game
but
they
wo
let
me
take
any
tricks
i
been
an
apprentice
hand
for
two
years
now
i
tired
of
it
i
want
to
be
in
on
a
killing
i
want
to
taste
blood
i
want
a
chance
at
some
of
the
money
real
money
emma
mcchesney
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
surveyed
the
angry
figure
before
her
with
quiet
steady
eyes
i
might
have
known
that
only
one
thing
could
bring
those
lines
into
your
face
son
she
paused
a
moment
so
you
want
money
as
badly
as
all
that
do
you
jock
hand
came
down
with
a
thwack
on
the
papers
before
him
want
it
you
just
bet
i
want
it
do
i
know
her
asked
emma
mcchesney
quietly
jock
stopped
short
in
his
excited
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
do
you
know
why
i
did
say
there
what
makes
you
think
that
when
a
youngster
like
you
whose
greatest
worry
has
been
whether
harvard
hold
again
this
year
with
baxter
out
begins
to
howl
about
not
being
appreciated
in
business
and
to
wear
a
late
fall
line
of
wrinkles
where
he
has
been
smooth
before
i
feel
justified
in
saying
i
know
her
well
it
is
any
one
at
least
it
is
what
you
mean
you
think
it
is
when
you
say
you
careful
there
you
trip
never
you
mind
what
i
mean
i
think
it
is
when
i
say
count
ten
and
then
just
tell
me
what
you
think
you
mean
jock
passed
his
hand
over
his
head
again
with
that
nervous
little
gesture
then
he
sat
down
a
little
wearily
he
stared
moodily
down
at
the
pile
of
papers
before
him
his
mother
faced
him
quietly
across
the
table
grace
galt
getting
twice
as
much
as
i
am
jock
broke
out
with
savage
suddenness
the
first
year
i
did
mind
a
fellow
gets
accustomed
these
days
to
see
women
breaking
into
all
the
professions
and
getting
away
with
salaries
but
her
pay
check
doubles
mine
more
than
doubles
it
it
been
my
experience
observed
emma
mcchesney
that
when
a
firm
condescends
to
pay
a
woman
twice
as
much
as
a
man
that
means
she
worth
six
times
as
much
a
painful
red
crept
into
jock
face
maybe
two
years
ago
that
would
have
sounded
reasonable
to
me
two
years
ago
when
i
walked
down
broadway
at
night
a
electric
sign
at
was
just
an
electric
sign
to
me
just
part
of
the
decoration
like
the
chorus
girls
and
the
midnight
theater
crowds
now
well
now
every
blink
of
every
red
and
yellow
globe
is
crammed
full
of
meaning
i
know
the
power
that
advertising
has
how
it
influences
our
manners
and
our
morals
and
our
minds
and
our
health
it
regulates
the
food
we
eat
and
the
clothes
we
wear
and
the
books
we
read
and
the
entertainment
we
seek
colossal
that
what
it
is
it
keep
on
like
that
for
another
two
years
sonny
and
no
business
banquet
will
be
complete
without
you
the
next
thing
you
know
you
be
addressing
the
advertising
classes
on
the
young
man
in
business
jock
laughed
a
rueful
little
laugh
i
did
mean
to
make
a
speech
i
was
just
trying
to
say
that
i
served
my
apprenticeship
it
hurts
a
fellow
pride
you
ca
hold
your
head
up
before
a
girl
when
you
know
her
salary
twice
yours
and
you
know
that
she
knows
it
why
look
at
hoffman
who
with
the
dowd
agency
of
course
she
a
wonder
even
if
her
face
does
look
like
the
variety
she
can
write
copy
that
lifts
a
campaign
right
out
of
the
humdrum
class
and
makes
it
luminous
her
husband
works
in
a
bank
somewhere
he
earns
about
as
much
as
hoffman
pays
the
least
of
her
department
subordinates
and
he
so
subdued
that
he
when
he
walks
and
they
call
him
the
human
emma
mcchesney
was
regarding
her
son
with
a
little
puzzled
frown
suddenly
she
reached
out
and
tapped
the
topmost
of
the
scribbled
sheets
strewn
the
length
of
jock
side
of
the
table
what
all
this
jock
tipped
back
his
chair
and
surveyed
the
clutter
before
him
that
said
he
is
what
is
known
on
the
stage
as
papers
and
it
the
real
plot
of
this
piece
i
thought
so
just
favor
me
with
a
scenario
will
you
jock
stuck
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
and
began
scene
offices
of
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
time
the
present
characters
jock
mcchesney
handsome
daring
brilliant
suppose
you
er
skip
the
characters
however
fascinating
and
get
to
the
action
jock
mcchesney
brought
the
tipped
chair
down
on
with
a
thud
and
stood
up
the
grin
was
gone
he
was
as
serious
as
he
had
been
in
the
midst
of
his
tirade
of
five
minutes
before
all
right
here
it
is
and
do
blame
me
if
it
sounds
like
cheap
melodrama
this
stuff
and
he
waved
a
hand
toward
the
table
is
an
advertising
campaign
plan
for
the
griebler
gum
company
of
louis
oh
do
look
impressed
the
office
handed
me
any
such
commission
i
just
got
the
idea
like
a
flash
and
i
been
working
it
out
for
the
last
two
weeks
it
worked
itself
out
almost
the
way
a
really
scorching
idea
does
sometimes
this
griebler
has
been
advertising
for
years
you
know
the
griebler
gum
but
it
has
been
the
right
sort
of
advertising
old
griebler
the
original
gum
man
had
fogy
notions
about
advertising
and
as
long
as
he
lived
they
had
to
keep
it
down
he
died
a
few
months
ago
you
must
have
read
of
it
left
a
regular
mint
ben
griebler
the
oldest
son
started
right
in
to
clean
out
the
cobwebs
of
course
the
advertising
end
of
it
has
come
in
for
its
share
of
the
soap
and
water
he
wants
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
it
every
advertising
firm
in
the
country
has
been
angling
for
the
contract
it
going
to
be
a
real
one
of
the
crowd
have
submitted
plans
and
that
just
where
my
kick
comes
in
the
berg
shriner
company
makes
it
a
rule
never
to
submit
advance
plans
excuse
me
if
i
seem
a
trifle
rude
interrupted
mcchesney
but
i
like
to
know
where
you
think
you
been
wronged
in
this
right
here
replied
jock
and
he
slapped
his
pocket
and
here
he
pointed
to
his
head
two
spots
so
vital
that
they
make
old
achilles
heel
seem
ben
griebler
is
one
of
the
kind
he
wants
value
received
for
money
expended
and
while
everybody
knows
that
he
has
a
loving
eye
on
the
berg
shriner
crowd
he
wo
sign
a
thing
until
he
knows
what
getting
a
firm
record
standing
staff
equipment
mean
nothing
to
him
but
jock
i
still
do
see
jock
gathered
up
a
sheaf
of
loose
papers
and
brandished
them
in
the
air
this
is
where
i
come
in
i
got
a
plan
here
that
will
fetch
this
griebler
person
oh
i
not
dreaming
i
outlined
it
for
sam
hupp
and
he
was
crazy
about
it
sam
hupp
had
some
sort
of
plan
outlined
himself
but
he
said
this
made
his
sound
as
dry
as
cigars
in
denver
and
you
know
yourself
that
sam
hupp
copy
is
so
brilliant
that
he
could
sell
brewery
advertising
to
a
temperance
magazine
emma
mcchesney
stood
up
she
looked
a
little
impatient
and
a
trifle
puzzled
but
why
all
this
talk
i
do
get
you
take
your
plan
to
berg
if
it
what
you
think
it
is
he
see
it
quicker
than
any
other
human
being
and
he
probably
fall
on
your
neck
and
invest
you
in
royal
robes
and
give
you
a
mahogany
desk
all
your
own
oh
what
the
good
retorted
jock
disgustedly
this
griebler
has
an
appointment
at
the
office
he
be
closeted
with
the
old
man
they
call
in
hupp
but
never
a
plan
will
they
reveal
it
against
their
code
of
ethics
ethics
i
sick
of
the
word
i
suppose
you
say
i
lucky
to
be
associated
with
a
firm
like
that
and
i
suppose
i
am
but
i
wish
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
of
business
that
they
were
so
bloomin
conservative
ethics
they
all
balled
up
in
like
henry
james
in
his
style
emma
mcchesney
came
over
from
her
side
of
the
table
and
stood
very
close
to
her
son
she
laid
one
hand
very
lightly
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
the
sullen
angry
young
face
illustration
she
laid
one
hand
very
lightly
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
the
sullen
angry
young
face
i
seen
older
men
than
you
are
jock
and
better
men
and
bigger
men
wearing
that
same
look
and
for
the
same
reason
every
ambitious
man
or
woman
in
business
wears
it
at
one
time
or
another
sooner
or
later
jock
you
have
your
chance
at
the
money
end
of
this
game
if
you
do
care
about
the
thing
you
call
ethics
it
be
sooner
if
you
do
care
it
will
be
later
it
rests
with
you
but
it
bound
to
come
because
you
got
the
stuff
in
you
maybe
replied
jock
the
cynical
but
his
face
lost
some
of
its
sullenness
as
he
looked
down
at
that
earnest
vivid
countenance
to
his
maybe
it
sounds
all
right
mother
in
the
story
books
but
i
not
quite
solid
on
it
these
days
it
so
much
what
you
got
in
you
that
counts
as
what
you
can
bring
out
i
know
the
young
man
slogan
used
to
be
and
wait
or
something
pretty
like
that
but
these
days
they
boiled
it
down
to
one
word
the
marvel
of
it
is
that
there
are
more
of
observed
emma
mcchesney
sadly
more
what
more
lines
here
she
touched
his
forehead
and
here
she
touched
his
eyes
lines
jock
swung
to
face
a
mirror
good
i
so
infernally
that
no
one
takes
me
seriously
it
darned
hard
trying
to
convince
people
you
a
captain
of
finance
when
you
look
like
an
errand
boy
from
the
center
of
the
room
mcchesney
watched
the
boy
as
he
surveyed
himself
in
the
glass
and
as
she
gazed
there
came
a
frightened
look
into
her
eyes
it
was
gone
in
a
minute
and
in
its
place
came
a
curious
little
gleam
half
amused
half
pugnacious
jock
mcchesney
if
i
thought
that
you
meant
half
of
what
said
about
honor
and
ethics
and
all
that
i
spank
me
i
suppose
said
the
young
no
and
all
the
humor
had
fled
i
jock
i
never
said
much
to
you
about
your
father
but
i
think
you
know
that
he
was
what
he
was
to
the
day
of
his
death
you
were
just
about
eight
when
i
made
up
my
mind
that
life
with
him
was
impossible
i
said
then
and
you
were
all
i
had
son
that
i
rather
see
you
dead
than
to
have
you
turn
out
to
be
a
son
of
your
father
do
make
me
remember
that
wish
jock
two
quick
steps
and
his
arms
were
about
her
his
face
was
all
contrition
why
mother
i
did
mean
you
see
this
is
business
and
i
crazy
to
make
good
and
it
such
a
fight
do
i
know
it
demanded
emma
mcchesney
i
guess
your
mother
has
been
sitting
home
embroidering
lunchcloths
these
last
fifteen
years
she
lifted
her
head
from
the
boy
shoulder
and
now
son
considering
me
not
as
your
doting
mother
but
in
my
business
capacity
as
secretary
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
suppose
you
reveal
to
me
the
inner
workings
of
this
plan
of
yours
i
like
to
know
if
you
really
are
the
advertising
wizard
that
you
think
you
are
so
it
was
that
long
after
annie
dinner
dishes
had
ceased
to
clatter
in
the
kitchen
long
after
she
had
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
to
ask
aigs
cakes
for
breakfast
long
after
those
two
busy
brains
should
have
rested
in
sleep
the
two
sat
at
either
side
of
the
table
the
face
of
one
glowing
as
he
talked
the
face
of
the
other
sparkling
as
she
listened
and
at
midnight
why
you
infant
wonder
exclaimed
emma
mcchesney
at
nine
next
morning
when
jock
mcchesney
entered
the
offices
of
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
he
carried
a
flat
compact
bundle
of
papers
under
his
arm
encased
in
protecting
covers
of
pasteboard
and
further
secured
by
bands
of
elastic
this
he
carried
to
his
desk
deposited
in
a
drawer
and
locked
the
drawer
by
eleven
the
things
which
he
had
predicted
the
night
before
had
come
to
pass
a
plump
little
man
with
a
fussy
manner
and
western
clothes
had
been
ushered
into
bartholomew
private
office
instinct
told
him
that
this
was
griebler
jock
left
his
desk
and
strolled
up
to
get
the
switchboard
confirmation
of
his
guess
half
an
hour
later
sam
hupp
hustled
by
and
disappeared
into
the
old
man
sanctum
jock
fingered
the
upper
drawer
of
his
desk
the
maddening
blankness
of
that
closed
door
if
only
he
could
find
some
excuse
for
walking
into
that
room
any
old
excuse
no
matter
how
wild
just
to
get
a
chance
at
it
his
telephone
rang
he
picked
up
the
receiver
his
eye
on
the
closed
door
his
thoughts
inside
that
room
berg
wants
to
see
you
right
away
came
the
voice
of
the
switchboard
operator
something
seemed
to
give
way
inside
something
in
the
region
of
his
brain
no
his
heart
no
his
lungs
well
can
you
beat
that
said
jock
mcchesney
aloud
in
a
kind
of
trance
of
joy
can
you
beat
that
then
he
buttoned
the
lower
button
of
his
coat
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
extra
wriggle
at
the
collar
the
modern
method
of
girding
up
his
loins
and
walked
calmly
into
bartholomew
berg
very
private
office
in
the
second
that
elapsed
between
the
opening
and
the
closing
of
the
door
jock
glance
swept
the
three
men
bartholomew
berg
quiet
inscrutable
seated
at
his
great
griebler
lost
in
the
depths
of
a
great
leather
chair
smoking
fussily
and
twitching
with
a
hundred
little
restless
irritating
gestures
sam
hupp
standing
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
hands
in
pockets
attitude
argumentative
this
is
mcchesney
said
bartholomew
berg
griebler
mcchesney
jock
came
forward
smiling
that
charming
smile
of
his
griebler
he
said
extending
his
hand
this
is
a
great
pleasure
hm
growled
ben
griebler
i
did
know
they
picked
so
young
his
voice
was
a
piping
falsetto
that
somehow
seemed
to
match
his
restless
little
eyes
jock
thrust
his
hands
hurriedly
into
his
pockets
he
felt
his
face
getting
scarlet
they
ah
using
young
this
year
said
bartholomew
berg
his
voice
sounded
bigger
and
smoother
and
pleasanter
than
ever
in
contrast
with
that
other
shrill
tone
i
prefer
young
myself
you
never
catch
mcchesney
using
the
last
to
drive
home
an
argument
he
has
a
new
idea
about
every
nineteen
minutes
and
every
other
one
a
good
one
and
every
nineteenth
or
so
an
inspiration
the
old
man
laughed
one
of
his
low
chuckling
laughs
hm
that
so
piped
ben
griebler
up
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
we
are
so
long
on
inspiration
we
just
working
men
and
we
wear
working
clothes
oh
now
protested
berg
his
eyes
twinkling
necktie
and
socks
and
handkerchief
may
form
one
lovely
blissful
color
scheme
but
that
does
signify
that
his
advertising
schemes
are
not
just
as
carefully
and
artistically
blended
ben
griebler
looked
shrewdly
up
at
jock
through
narrowed
lids
maybe
i
talk
to
you
in
a
minute
young
man
that
is
he
turned
quickly
upon
berg
if
that
is
against
your
crazy
principles
too
why
not
at
all
bartholomew
berg
assured
him
not
at
all
you
do
me
an
injustice
griebler
moved
up
closer
to
the
broad
table
the
two
fell
into
a
talk
jock
looked
rather
helplessly
around
at
sam
hupp
that
alert
gentleman
was
signaling
him
frantically
with
head
and
wagging
finger
jock
crossed
the
big
room
to
hupp
side
the
two
moved
off
to
a
window
at
the
far
end
give
heed
to
your
unkie
said
sam
hupp
talking
very
rapidly
very
softly
and
out
of
one
corner
of
his
mouth
this
looking
for
an
advertising
manager
he
as
as
a
a
well
as
a
pig
i
suppose
but
it
a
corking
chance
youngster
and
the
old
man
just
recommended
you
strong
now
me
exploded
jock
shut
up
hissed
hupp
two
or
three
years
with
that
firm
would
be
the
making
of
you
if
you
made
good
of
course
and
you
could
they
want
to
move
their
factory
here
from
louis
within
the
next
few
years
now
listen
when
he
talks
to
you
you
play
up
the
keen
alert
stuff
with
a
dash
of
sophistication
see
if
you
can
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
throw
a
kind
of
a
canny
look
into
your
eyes
all
the
better
he
gabby
enough
for
two
try
a
line
of
talk
that
is
filled
with
the
fire
and
enthusiasm
of
youth
combined
with
the
good
judgment
and
experience
of
middle
age
and
you
say
look
here
stammered
jock
even
if
i
was
warfield
enough
to
do
all
that
honestly
think
me
an
advertising
manager
with
a
salary
that
griebler
you
nervy
little
shrimp
go
in
and
win
he
pay
five
thousand
if
he
pays
a
cent
but
he
wants
value
for
money
expended
now
tipped
you
off
you
make
your
killing
oh
mcchesney
called
bartholomew
berg
glancing
round
yes
sir
said
jock
and
stood
before
him
in
the
same
moment
griebler
is
looking
for
a
competent
enthusiastic
man
as
advertising
manager
i
spoken
to
him
of
you
i
know
what
you
can
do
griebler
might
trust
my
judgment
in
this
but
i
trust
my
own
judgment
snapped
ben
griebler
it
good
enough
for
me
very
well
returned
bartholomew
berg
suavely
and
if
you
decide
to
place
your
advertising
future
in
the
hands
of
the
berg
shriner
company
now
look
here
interrupted
ben
griebler
again
i
tie
up
with
you
people
when
you
shaken
something
out
of
your
cuffs
i
not
the
kind
that
buys
a
pig
in
a
poke
we
going
to
spend
money
real
money
in
this
campaign
of
ours
but
i
not
such
a
as
to
hand
you
half
a
million
or
so
and
get
a
promise
in
return
i
want
your
plans
and
i
want
in
full
a
little
exclamation
broke
from
sam
hupp
he
checked
it
but
not
before
berg
curiously
penetrating
pale
blue
eyes
had
glanced
up
at
him
and
away
again
i
told
you
griebler
went
on
bartholomew
berg
patient
voice
just
why
the
thing
you
insist
on
is
impossible
this
firm
does
not
submit
advance
copy
every
business
commission
that
comes
to
us
is
given
all
the
skill
and
thought
and
enthusiasm
and
careful
planning
that
this
office
is
capable
of
you
know
our
record
this
is
a
business
of
ideas
and
ideas
are
too
precious
too
perishable
to
spread
in
the
market
place
for
all
to
see
ben
griebler
stood
up
his
cigar
waggled
furiously
between
his
lips
as
he
talked
i
know
something
else
that
do
stand
spreading
in
the
market
place
berg
and
that
money
it
too
darned
perishable
too
he
pointed
a
stubby
finger
at
jock
does
this
fool
rule
of
yours
apply
to
this
young
fellow
too
bartholomew
berg
seemed
to
grow
more
patient
more
as
the
other
man
slipped
rapidly
away
it
goes
for
every
man
and
woman
in
this
office
griebler
this
young
chap
mcchesney
here
might
spend
weeks
and
months
building
up
a
comprehensive
advertising
plan
for
you
he
spend
those
weeks
studying
your
business
from
every
possible
angle
perhaps
it
would
be
a
plan
that
would
require
a
year
of
waiting
before
the
actual
advertising
began
to
appear
and
then
you
might
lose
faith
in
the
plan
a
waiting
game
is
a
hard
game
to
play
some
other
man
idea
that
promised
quicker
action
might
appeal
to
you
and
when
it
appeared
we
very
likely
find
our
own
original
idea
incorporated
in
say
look
here
squeaked
ben
griebler
his
face
dully
red
mean
to
imply
that
i
steal
your
plan
mean
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
to
my
face
griebler
i
mean
that
that
thing
happens
constantly
in
this
business
we
almost
powerless
to
stop
it
nothing
spreads
quicker
than
a
new
idea
compared
to
it
a
woman
secret
is
a
sealed
book
ben
griebler
removed
the
cigar
from
his
lips
he
was
stuttering
with
anger
with
a
mingling
of
despair
and
boldness
jock
saw
the
advantage
of
that
stuttering
moment
and
seized
on
it
he
stepped
close
to
the
broad
resting
both
hands
on
it
and
leaning
forward
slightly
in
his
eagerness
berg
i
have
a
plan
hupp
can
tell
you
it
came
to
me
when
i
first
heard
that
the
grieblers
were
going
to
broaden
out
it
a
real
idea
i
sure
of
that
i
worked
it
out
in
detail
hupp
himself
said
it
why
i
got
the
actual
copy
and
new
absolutely
it
never
trot
it
out
shouted
ben
griebler
i
like
to
see
one
idea
anyway
around
this
shop
mcchesney
said
bartholomew
berg
not
raising
his
voice
his
eyes
rested
on
jock
with
the
steady
penetrating
gaze
that
was
peculiar
to
him
more
foolhardy
men
than
jock
mcchesney
had
faltered
and
paused
abashed
under
those
eyes
mcchesney
your
enthusiasm
for
your
work
is
causing
you
to
forget
one
thing
that
must
never
be
forgotten
in
this
office
jock
stepped
back
his
lower
lip
was
caught
between
his
teeth
at
the
same
moment
ben
griebler
snatched
up
his
hat
from
the
table
clapped
it
on
his
head
at
an
absurd
angle
and
bristling
like
a
fighting
cock
confronted
the
three
men
i
got
a
couple
of
rules
myself
he
cried
and
do
you
forget
it
when
you
get
a
little
spare
time
you
look
up
louis
and
find
out
what
state
it
in
the
slogan
of
that
state
is
my
slogan
you
bet
if
you
think
i
going
to
make
you
a
present
of
the
money
that
it
took
my
old
man
fifty
years
to
pile
up
then
you
do
know
that
griebler
is
a
german
name
good
day
gents
he
stalked
to
the
door
there
he
turned
dramatically
and
leveled
a
forefinger
at
jock
they
got
you
roped
and
tied
but
i
think
you
a
comer
if
you
change
your
mind
kid
come
and
see
me
the
door
slammed
behind
him
whew
whistled
sam
hupp
passing
a
handkerchief
over
his
bald
spot
bartholomew
berg
reached
out
with
one
great
capable
hand
and
swept
toward
him
a
pile
of
papers
oh
well
you
ca
blame
him
advertising
has
been
a
scream
for
so
long
griebler
does
know
the
difference
between
advertising
publicity
and
bunk
learn
but
it
be
an
awfully
expensive
course
now
hupp
go
over
this
kalamazoo
account
that
be
all
mcchesney
jock
turned
without
a
word
he
walked
quickly
through
the
outer
office
into
the
great
main
room
there
he
stopped
at
the
switchboard
er
miss
grimes
he
said
smiling
charmingly
where
this
griebler
of
louis
stopping
do
you
know
say
where
would
he
stop
retorted
the
wise
miss
grimes
look
at
him
the
waldorf
of
course
thanks
said
jock
still
smiling
and
went
back
to
his
desk
at
five
jock
left
the
office
under
his
arm
he
carried
the
flat
pasteboard
package
secured
by
elastic
bands
at
he
walked
swiftly
down
the
famous
corridor
of
the
great
red
stone
hotel
the
colorful
glittering
crowd
that
surged
all
about
him
he
seemed
not
to
see
he
made
straight
for
the
main
desk
with
its
battalion
of
clerks
illustration
he
made
straight
for
the
main
desk
with
its
battalion
of
clerks
griebler
in
ben
griebler
st
louis
the
question
set
in
motion
the
hotel
elaborate
system
of
investigation
at
last
not
in
do
you
know
when
he
will
be
in
that
futile
question
ca
say
he
left
no
word
do
you
want
to
leave
your
name
would
he
does
he
stop
at
this
desk
when
he
comes
in
he
was
an
unusually
urbane
hotel
clerk
why
usually
they
leave
their
keys
and
get
their
mail
from
the
floor
clerk
but
griebler
seems
to
prefer
the
main
desk
i
wait
said
jock
and
seated
in
one
of
the
great
thronelike
chairs
he
waited
he
sat
there
slim
and
boyish
while
the
laughing
chattering
crowd
swept
all
about
him
if
you
sit
long
enough
in
that
foyer
you
will
learn
all
there
is
to
learn
about
life
an
amazing
sight
it
is
that
crowd
baraboo
helps
swell
it
and
spokane
and
berlin
and
budapest
and
pekin
and
paris
and
waco
texas
so
varied
it
is
so
cosmopolitan
that
if
you
sit
there
patiently
enough
and
watch
sharply
enough
you
will
even
see
a
chance
new
yorker
from
door
to
desk
jock
eyes
swept
the
crowd
in
paradise
feathers
and
furs
and
frock
coats
swam
back
and
forth
he
saw
it
give
way
to
the
dinner
throng
bejeweled
hurrying
through
its
oysters
swallowing
unbelievable
numbers
of
drinks
and
drinks
and
maroon
drinks
then
gathering
up
its
furs
and
rushing
theaterwards
he
was
still
sitting
there
when
that
crowd
its
eight
freshness
somewhat
sullied
its
sparkle
a
trifle
dimmed
swept
back
for
more
oysters
more
and
drinks
at
intervals
then
at
hourly
intervals
the
figure
in
the
great
chair
stirred
rose
and
walked
to
the
desk
has
griebler
come
in
the
supper
throng
its
laugh
a
little
ribald
its
talk
a
shade
drifted
towards
the
street
or
was
wafted
up
in
elevators
the
throng
thinned
to
an
occasional
group
then
these
became
rarer
and
rarer
the
revolving
door
admitted
one
man
or
two
perhaps
who
lingered
not
at
all
in
the
unaccustomed
quiet
of
the
great
glittering
lobby
the
figure
of
the
watcher
took
on
a
pathetic
droop
the
eyelids
grew
leaden
to
open
them
meant
an
almost
superhuman
effort
the
stare
of
the
new
night
clerks
grew
more
and
more
hostile
and
suspicious
a
grayish
pallor
had
settled
down
on
the
boy
face
and
those
lines
of
the
night
before
stood
out
for
all
to
see
in
the
stillness
of
the
place
the
big
revolving
door
turned
once
more
complainingly
for
the
thousandth
time
jock
eyes
lifted
heavily
then
they
flew
wide
open
the
drooping
figure
straightened
electrically
half
a
dozen
quick
steps
and
jock
stood
in
the
pathway
of
ben
griebler
who
rather
ruffled
and
untidy
had
blown
in
on
the
wings
of
the
morning
he
stared
a
moment
well
what
i
been
waiting
for
you
here
since
five
last
evening
it
will
soon
be
five
again
will
you
let
me
show
you
those
plans
now
ben
griebler
had
surveyed
jock
with
the
stony
calm
of
the
visitor
who
is
prepared
to
show
surprise
at
nothing
in
new
york
there
nothing
like
getting
an
early
start
said
ben
griebler
come
on
up
to
my
room
key
in
hand
he
made
for
the
elevator
for
an
almost
imperceptible
moment
jock
paused
then
with
a
little
rush
he
followed
the
short
figure
i
knew
you
had
it
in
you
mcchesney
i
said
you
looked
like
a
comer
i
jock
said
nothing
he
was
silent
while
griebler
unlocked
his
door
turned
on
the
light
fumbled
at
the
windows
and
shades
picked
up
the
telephone
receiver
what
you
have
nothing
jock
had
cleared
the
center
table
and
was
opening
his
flat
bundle
of
papers
he
drew
up
two
chairs
let
not
waste
any
time
he
said
i
had
a
wait
for
this
he
seemed
to
control
the
situation
obediently
ben
griebler
hung
up
the
receiver
came
over
and
took
the
chair
very
close
to
jock
illustration
not
waste
any
time
he
said
there
nothing
artistic
about
gum
began
jock
mcchesney
and
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
who
is
sure
of
himself
it
a
product
and
it
ought
to
be
handled
from
a
standpoint
every
gum
concern
in
the
country
has
spent
thousands
on
a
campaign
before
it
realized
that
gum
is
a
candy
and
drug
store
article
and
that
no
man
is
going
to
push
a
package
of
gum
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
sale
of
an
box
of
candy
but
the
health
note
is
there
if
only
you
strike
it
right
now
here
my
idea
at
six
ben
griebler
his
little
shrewd
eyes
sparkling
his
voice
more
squeakily
falsetto
than
ever
surveyed
the
youngster
before
him
with
a
certain
awe
this
this
thing
will
actually
sell
our
stuff
in
europe
no
gum
concern
has
ever
been
able
to
make
the
stuff
go
outside
of
this
country
why
inside
of
three
years
every
and
in
england
be
chewing
it
on
bank
holidays
i
do
know
about
germany
but
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
got
up
well
solid
on
that
and
what
i
say
goes
now
i
tell
you
what
do
kid
i
take
you
down
to
louis
with
me
at
a
figure
that
make
your
jock
looked
up
or
if
you
do
want
the
berg
shriner
crowd
to
get
wise
fix
it
this
way
i
go
over
there
this
morning
and
tell
changed
my
mind
see
the
campaign
theirs
see
then
i
refuse
to
consider
any
of
their
suggestions
until
i
see
your
plan
and
when
i
see
it
i
fall
for
it
like
a
ton
of
bricks
old
never
know
he
so
darned
jock
mcchesney
stood
up
the
little
drawn
pinched
look
which
had
made
his
face
so
queerly
old
was
gone
his
eyes
were
bright
his
face
was
flushed
there
you
said
it
i
did
realize
how
raw
this
deal
was
until
you
put
it
into
words
for
me
i
want
to
thank
you
right
bartholomew
berg
is
so
darned
that
two
muckers
like
you
and
me
groveling
around
in
the
dirt
ca
even
see
the
tips
of
the
heights
to
which
his
ideals
have
soared
stop
me
i
know
i
talking
like
a
book
but
i
feel
like
something
that
has
just
been
kicked
out
into
the
sunshine
after
having
been
in
jail
you
tired
said
ben
griebler
it
been
a
strain
something
always
snaps
after
a
long
tension
jock
flat
palm
came
down
among
the
papers
with
a
crack
you
bet
something
snaps
it
has
just
snapped
inside
me
he
began
quietly
to
gather
up
the
papers
in
an
orderly
little
way
what
that
for
inquired
griebler
coming
forward
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
going
to
go
home
and
square
this
thing
with
a
lady
you
never
met
you
and
she
would
get
on
if
you
did
you
do
talk
the
same
language
then
i
going
to
have
a
cold
bath
and
a
hot
breakfast
and
then
griebler
i
going
to
take
this
stuff
to
bartholomew
berg
and
tell
him
the
whole
nasty
business
he
see
the
humor
of
it
but
i
do
know
whether
he
fire
me
or
make
me
of
the
company
now
if
you
want
to
come
over
and
talk
to
him
fair
and
square
why
come
ten
to
one
he
fires
you
remarked
griebler
as
jock
reached
the
door
there
only
one
person
i
know
who
game
enough
to
take
you
up
on
that
and
it
going
to
take
more
nerve
to
face
her
at
than
it
will
to
tackle
a
whole
battalion
of
bartholomew
bergs
at
nine
well
i
guess
i
can
get
in
a
sleep
before
er
before
what
said
jock
mcchesney
from
the
door
ben
griebler
laughed
a
little
shamefaced
laugh
before
i
see
you
at
ten
sonny
v
the
there
is
nothing
in
the
sound
of
the
shrill
little
bell
to
warn
us
of
the
import
of
its
message
more
the
pity
it
may
be
that
bore
whose
telephone
conversation
begins
well
what
do
you
know
it
may
be
your
lawyer
to
say
you
inherited
a
million
hence
the
arrogance
of
the
instrument
it
knows
its
voice
will
never
wilfully
go
unanswered
so
long
as
the
element
of
chance
lies
concealed
within
it
emma
mcchesney
heard
the
call
of
her
telephone
across
the
hall
seated
in
the
office
of
her
business
partner
buck
she
was
fathoms
deep
in
discussion
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
new
spring
line
the
buzzer
insistent
voice
brought
her
to
her
feet
even
while
she
frowned
at
the
interruption
that
be
baumgartner
about
those
silk
swatches
back
in
a
minute
said
emma
mcchesney
and
hurried
across
the
hall
just
in
time
to
break
the
second
call
the
perfunctory
hello
yes
was
followed
by
a
swift
change
of
countenance
a
surprised
little
cry
then
in
quite
another
tone
oh
it
you
jock
i
was
expecting
no
not
too
busy
to
talk
to
you
you
young
chump
go
on
a
moment
of
silence
while
mcchesney
face
smiled
and
glowed
like
a
girl
as
she
listened
to
the
voice
of
her
son
then
suddenly
glow
and
smile
faded
she
grew
tense
her
head
that
had
been
leaning
so
carelessly
on
the
hand
that
held
the
receiver
came
up
with
a
jerk
jock
mcchesney
she
gasped
you
why
you
do
mean
now
emma
mcchesney
was
not
a
woman
given
to
jerky
conversations
interspersed
with
exclamation
points
her
poise
and
balance
had
become
a
proverb
in
the
business
world
yet
her
lips
were
trembling
now
her
eyes
were
very
round
and
bright
her
face
had
flushed
then
grown
white
her
voice
shook
a
little
yes
of
course
i
am
only
i
so
surprised
yes
i
be
home
early
at
the
latest
she
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
little
fumbling
gesture
her
hand
dropped
to
her
lap
then
came
up
to
her
throat
a
moment
dropped
again
she
sat
staring
straight
ahead
with
eyes
that
saw
one
thousand
miles
away
from
his
office
across
the
hall
buck
strolled
in
casually
did
baumgartner
say
he
he
stopped
as
mcchesney
looked
up
at
him
a
quick
step
forward
what
the
matter
emma
jock
jock
jock
what
happened
to
the
boy
then
as
she
still
stared
at
him
her
face
pitiful
his
hand
patted
her
shoulder
dear
girl
tell
me
he
bent
over
her
all
solicitude
do
said
emma
mcchesney
faintly
and
shook
off
his
hand
your
stenographer
can
see
what
will
the
office
think
please
oh
darn
the
stenographer
what
this
bad
news
of
jock
emma
mcchesney
sat
up
she
smiled
a
little
nervously
and
passed
her
handkerchief
across
her
lips
i
did
say
it
was
bad
did
i
that
is
not
exactly
bad
i
suppose
buck
ran
a
frenzied
hand
over
his
head
my
dear
child
with
careful
politeness
will
you
please
try
to
be
sane
i
find
you
sitting
at
your
desk
staring
into
space
your
face
white
as
a
ghost
your
whole
appearance
that
of
a
person
who
has
received
a
and
then
you
say
exactly
bad
it
this
explained
emma
mcchesney
in
a
hollow
tone
the
berg
shriner
advertising
company
has
appointed
jock
manager
of
their
new
western
branch
they
opening
offices
in
chicago
in
march
her
lower
lip
quivered
she
caught
it
sharply
between
her
teeth
for
one
surprised
moment
buck
stared
in
silence
then
a
roar
broke
from
him
not
exactly
bad
he
boomed
between
laughs
not
exactly
b
not
eh
then
he
was
off
again
mcchesney
surveyed
him
in
hurt
and
dignified
silence
then
well
really
do
mind
me
what
you
find
so
exquisitely
funny
that
the
funniest
part
of
it
that
you
of
all
people
should
see
the
joke
not
exactly
bad
he
wiped
his
eyes
why
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
because
your
young
cub
of
a
son
by
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
has
landed
a
job
that
men
twice
his
age
would
give
their
eyeteeth
to
get
i
find
you
sitting
at
the
telephone
looking
as
if
he
had
run
off
with
annie
the
cook
or
had
had
a
leg
cut
off
i
suppose
it
is
funny
only
the
joke
on
me
that
why
i
see
it
it
means
that
i
losing
him
that
the
first
selfish
word
i
ever
heard
you
utter
oh
do
think
i
not
happy
at
his
success
happy
have
i
hoped
for
it
and
worked
for
it
and
prayed
for
it
have
i
saved
for
it
and
skimped
for
it
how
do
you
think
i
could
have
stood
those
years
on
the
road
if
i
had
kept
up
courage
with
the
thought
that
it
was
all
for
him
do
i
know
how
narrowly
jock
escaped
being
the
wrong
kind
i
his
mother
but
i
not
quite
blind
i
know
he
had
the
making
of
a
cad
i
seen
him
start
off
in
the
wrong
direction
a
hundred
times
if
he
has
turned
out
a
success
it
because
you
steered
him
right
i
watched
you
make
him
over
and
now
when
his
big
chance
has
come
you
i
do
expect
you
to
understand
interrupted
emma
mcchesney
a
little
wearily
i
know
it
sounds
crazy
and
unreasonable
only
one
sort
of
human
being
who
could
understand
what
i
mean
that
a
woman
with
a
son
she
laughed
a
little
shamefacedly
i
talking
like
the
chorus
of
a
sob
song
but
the
truth
if
you
feel
like
that
emma
tell
him
to
stay
the
boy
go
if
he
thought
it
would
make
you
unhappy
not
go
cried
emma
mcchesney
sharply
i
like
to
see
him
dare
to
refuse
it
well
then
what
in
began
buck
bewildered
do
try
to
understand
it
it
no
use
do
try
to
poke
your
finger
into
the
whirligig
they
call
sphere
its
mechanism
is
too
complicated
it
the
same
quirk
that
makes
women
pray
for
daughters
and
men
for
sons
it
the
same
kink
that
makes
women
read
the
marriage
and
death
notices
first
in
a
newspaper
it
the
same
queer
strain
that
causes
a
mother
to
lavish
the
most
love
on
the
weakest
wilfullest
child
perhaps
i
would
have
loved
jock
so
much
if
there
had
been
that
streak
of
yellow
in
him
and
if
i
had
had
to
work
so
hard
to
dilute
it
until
now
it
only
a
faint
cream
color
there
ought
to
be
a
special
prayer
for
women
who
are
bringing
up
their
sons
alone
buck
stirred
a
little
uneasily
i
never
heard
you
talk
like
this
before
you
probably
never
will
again
she
swung
round
to
her
desk
buck
strolling
toward
the
door
still
wore
the
puzzled
look
i
do
know
what
makes
you
take
this
so
seriously
of
course
the
boy
will
be
a
long
way
off
but
then
you
been
separated
from
him
before
what
the
difference
now
said
emma
mcchesney
solemnly
jock
will
be
drawing
a
salary
now
something
tells
me
i
be
a
grandmother
in
another
two
years
girls
are
letting
men
like
jock
run
around
loose
he
be
gobbled
up
just
you
wait
oh
i
do
know
drawled
buck
mischievously
you
just
said
he
a
headstrong
young
cub
he
strikes
me
as
the
kind
raise
the
dickens
if
his
egg
happened
to
be
five
seconds
overtime
emma
mcchesney
swung
around
in
her
chair
look
here
as
business
partners
we
quarreled
about
everything
from
silk
samples
to
traveling
men
and
as
friends
we
wrangled
on
every
subject
from
weather
to
war
i
allowed
you
to
criticise
my
soul
theories
and
my
new
spring
hat
but
understand
that
i
the
only
living
person
who
has
the
right
to
villify
my
son
jock
mcchesney
the
telephone
buzzed
a
punctuation
to
this
period
baumgartner
inquired
buck
humbly
she
listened
a
moment
then
over
her
shoulder
baumgartner
grimly
her
hand
covering
the
mouthpiece
and
if
he
thinks
that
he
can
work
off
a
lot
of
last
year
silk
swatches
on
hello
yes
mcchesney
talking
look
here
baumgartner
and
for
the
time
being
emma
mcchesney
mother
was
relegated
to
the
background
while
emma
mcchesney
secretary
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
held
the
stage
having
said
that
she
would
be
home
at
mcchesney
was
home
at
being
that
kind
of
a
person
jock
came
in
at
six
breathless
eager
and
late
being
that
kind
of
a
person
he
found
his
mother
on
the
floor
before
the
chiffonier
in
his
bedroom
surrounded
by
piles
of
pajamas
socks
shirts
and
collars
illustration
he
found
his
mother
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
piles
of
pajamas
socks
shirts
and
collars
he
swooped
down
upon
her
from
the
doorway
what
do
you
think
of
your
boy
poor
eh
emma
mcchesney
looked
up
absently
jock
these
of
yours
did
wear
at
all
and
you
paid
five
dollars
for
them
what
in
you
enough
silk
socks
to
last
you
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
handkerchiefs
too
but
you
need
pajamas
jock
stooped
gathered
up
an
armful
of
miscellaneous
undergarments
and
tossed
them
into
an
open
drawer
then
he
shut
the
drawer
with
a
bang
reached
over
grasped
his
mother
firmly
under
the
arms
and
brought
her
to
her
feet
with
a
swing
we
will
now
consider
the
question
of
summer
underwear
ended
would
it
bore
you
too
much
to
touch
lightly
on
the
subject
of
your
son
future
emma
mcchesney
tall
straight
handsome
looked
up
at
her
son
taller
straighter
handsomer
then
she
took
him
by
the
coat
lapels
and
hugged
him
you
were
so
bursting
with
your
own
glory
that
i
could
resist
teasing
you
besides
i
had
to
do
something
to
keep
my
mind
off
off
why
blonde
dear
you
not
no
i
not
gulped
emma
mcchesney
do
flatter
yourself
young
tell
me
just
how
it
happened
from
the
beginning
she
perched
at
the
side
of
the
bed
jock
hands
in
pockets
hair
a
little
rumpled
paced
excitedly
up
and
down
before
her
as
he
talked
there
was
any
beginning
that
the
stunning
part
of
it
i
just
landed
right
into
the
middle
of
it
with
both
feet
i
knew
they
had
been
planning
to
start
a
big
western
branch
but
we
all
thought
they
pick
some
big
man
for
it
there
are
plenty
of
dubs
to
be
had
the
kind
that
answers
the
ad
wanted
young
man
preferably
married
able
to
furnish
reference
they
as
thick
as
advertising
men
in
detroit
on
monday
morning
but
we
knew
that
this
western
branch
was
going
to
be
given
an
equal
chance
with
the
new
york
office
those
big
western
advertisers
like
to
give
their
money
to
western
firms
if
they
can
so
we
figured
that
they
pick
a
real
even
hopper
or
hupp
maybe
and
start
out
with
a
bang
so
when
the
old
man
called
me
into
his
office
this
morning
i
was
as
unconscious
as
a
babe
well
you
know
berg
he
as
unexpected
as
a
summer
shower
and
twice
as
full
of
electricity
mcchesney
he
said
a
new
york
necktie
wearing
says
i
try
any
chicago
ties
from
choice
that
time
my
suit
case
went
astray
yes
he
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
table
top
a
couple
of
times
then
mcchesney
what
have
you
learned
about
advertising
in
the
last
two
and
a
half
years
i
was
wise
enough
as
to
bartholomew
berg
to
know
that
he
mean
any
knowledge
he
did
mean
rules
of
the
game
he
meant
tricks
i
said
learned
to
watch
a
man
eyes
when
talking
business
to
him
if
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
dilate
listening
to
you
and
thinking
about
what
you
saying
when
they
contract
it
means
that
he
only
faking
interest
even
though
looking
straight
at
you
and
wearing
a
rapt
expression
his
thoughts
are
miles
away
so
said
berg
and
sort
of
grinned
else
learned
that
one
negative
argument
is
worth
six
positive
ones
that
it
never
pays
to
knock
your
competitor
that
it
wise
to
fight
shy
of
that
joker
known
as
editorial
coöperation
so
said
berg
else
i
made
up
my
mind
i
could
play
the
game
as
long
as
he
could
learned
not
to
lose
my
temper
when
i
in
the
middle
of
a
impassioned
business
appeal
and
the
office
boy
bounces
in
to
say
to
the
boss
jones
is
waiting
she
says
you
were
going
to
help
her
pick
out
wall
paper
this
morning
and
jones
says
tell
her
i
be
there
in
five
minutes
you
learned
that
said
berg
says
i
i
learned
to
let
the
other
fellow
think
your
argument
his
own
he
likes
it
i
learned
that
the
surest
kind
of
copy
is
the
slow
insidious
kind
like
the
featherloom
petticoat
company
campaign
that
was
an
ideal
campaign
because
it
did
urge
and
insist
that
the
public
buy
featherlooms
it
just
eased
the
idea
to
them
it
started
by
sketching
a
history
of
the
petticoat
beginning
with
eve
fig
leaf
and
working
up
before
they
knew
it
they
were
interested
so
that
campaign
was
your
mother
idea
mcchesney
you
know
mother
he
thinks
you
a
wonder
so
i
am
agreed
emma
mcchesney
calmly
go
on
well
i
went
on
i
told
him
that
i
learned
to
stand
so
that
the
light
would
shine
in
my
client
eyes
when
i
was
talking
to
him
i
lost
a
big
order
once
because
the
glare
from
the
window
irritated
the
man
i
was
talking
to
i
told
berg
all
the
tricks
learned
and
some
i
had
thought
of
till
that
minute
berg
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
i
thought
he
was
sort
of
guying
me
as
he
sometimes
does
not
unkindly
you
know
but
in
that
quiet
way
he
has
finally
i
stopped
for
breath
or
something
and
he
said
let
me
talk
a
minute
mcchesney
anybody
can
teach
you
the
essentials
of
the
advertising
business
if
you
any
advertising
instinct
in
you
but
it
what
you
pick
up
on
the
side
by
your
own
efforts
and
out
of
your
own
experience
that
lifts
you
out
of
the
scrub
class
now
i
do
think
you
an
ideal
advertising
man
by
any
means
mcchesney
you
shy
on
training
and
experience
and
you
just
begun
to
acquire
that
golden
quality
known
as
balance
i
could
name
a
hundred
men
that
are
better
advertising
men
than
you
will
ever
be
those
men
have
advertising
ability
that
glows
steadily
and
evenly
like
a
fire
but
you
got
the
kind
of
ability
that
flares
up
dies
down
flares
up
but
every
flare
is
a
real
blaze
that
lights
things
red
while
it
lasts
and
sends
a
new
glow
through
the
veins
of
business
you
got
personality
and
youth
and
enthusiasm
and
a
precious
spark
of
the
real
thing
known
as
advertising
genius
there
no
describing
it
you
know
what
i
mean
also
you
know
enough
about
actual
advertising
not
to
run
an
ad
for
a
motor
car
in
the
police
gazette
all
of
which
leads
up
to
this
question
how
would
you
like
to
buy
your
neckties
in
chicago
mcchesney
i
blurted
taken
a
suite
of
offices
in
the
new
lakeview
building
on
michigan
avenue
would
you
like
your
office
done
in
mahogany
or
oak
jock
came
to
a
full
stop
before
his
mother
his
cheeks
were
scarlet
hers
were
pale
he
was
breathing
quickly
she
was
very
quiet
his
eyes
glowed
so
did
hers
but
the
glow
was
dimmed
by
a
mist
mahogany
richer
but
make
it
oak
son
it
does
show
so
then
quite
suddenly
she
stood
up
shaking
a
little
and
buried
her
face
in
the
boy
shoulder
why
why
mother
do
do
blonde
we
see
each
other
every
few
weeks
i
be
coming
to
new
york
to
see
the
sights
like
the
rest
of
the
rubes
and
i
suppose
the
noise
and
lights
will
confuse
me
so
that
i
be
glad
to
get
back
to
the
sylvan
quiet
of
chicago
and
then
you
run
out
there
eh
we
have
regular
bats
mack
dinner
and
the
theater
and
supper
yes
yes
said
emma
mcchesney
in
muffled
tones
that
totally
lacked
enthusiasm
chicago
really
only
a
suburb
of
new
york
anyway
these
days
and
emma
mcchesney
head
came
up
sharply
look
here
son
if
going
to
live
in
chicago
i
advise
you
to
cut
that
suburb
talk
and
sort
of
forget
new
york
chicago
quite
a
village
for
an
inland
settlement
even
if
it
has
only
two
or
three
million
people
and
a
lake
as
big
as
all
outdoors
that
kind
of
talk
wo
elect
you
to
the
university
club
son
so
they
talked
all
through
supper
and
during
the
evening
rather
jock
talked
and
his
mother
listened
interrupting
with
only
an
occasional
remark
when
the
bubble
of
the
boy
elation
seemed
to
grow
too
great
quite
suddenly
jock
was
silent
after
the
almost
incessant
rush
of
conversation
quiet
settled
down
strangely
on
the
two
seated
there
in
the
with
its
lamps
jock
picked
up
a
magazine
twirled
its
pages
put
it
down
strolled
into
his
own
room
and
back
again
mother
he
said
suddenly
standing
before
her
there
was
a
time
when
you
were
afraid
i
was
going
to
pan
out
there
not
exactly
afraid
dear
just
a
little
doubtful
perhaps
jock
smiled
a
tolerant
forgiving
smile
you
see
mother
you
did
understand
that
all
a
woman
does
i
was
all
right
a
man
would
have
realized
that
i
do
mean
dear
that
you
always
been
wonderful
because
you
have
but
it
takes
a
man
to
understand
a
man
when
you
thought
i
was
going
bad
on
your
hands
i
was
just
developing
that
all
remember
that
time
in
chicago
mother
yes
answered
emma
mcchesney
i
remember
now
a
man
would
have
understood
that
that
was
only
kid
foolishness
if
a
fellow
got
the
stuff
in
him
it
show
up
sooner
or
later
if
i
had
had
it
in
me
i
would
be
going
to
chicago
as
manager
of
the
berg
shriner
western
office
would
i
no
dear
jock
looked
at
her
in
an
instant
he
was
all
contrition
and
tenderness
you
tired
i
talked
you
to
death
have
i
lordy
it
midnight
and
i
want
to
get
down
early
conference
with
berg
and
hupp
he
tried
not
to
sound
too
important
emma
mcchesney
took
his
head
between
her
two
hands
and
kissed
him
once
on
the
lips
then
standing
kissed
his
eyelids
with
infinite
gentleness
as
you
kiss
a
baby
eyes
then
she
brought
his
cheek
up
against
hers
and
so
they
stood
for
a
moment
silently
ten
minutes
later
there
came
the
sound
of
blithe
whistling
from
jock
room
jock
always
whistled
when
he
went
to
bed
and
when
he
rose
even
these
years
of
living
in
a
new
york
apartment
had
not
broken
him
of
the
habit
it
was
a
cheerful
disconnected
whistling
sometimes
high
and
clear
sometimes
under
the
breath
sometimes
interspersed
with
song
and
sometimes
ceasing
altogether
at
critical
moments
say
during
shaving
or
while
bringing
the
up
tight
and
snug
under
the
collar
it
was
one
of
those
comfortable
little
noises
that
indicate
a
masculine
presence
one
of
those
pleasant
reassuring
noises
that
every
woman
loves
emma
mcchesney
putting
herself
to
bed
in
her
room
across
the
hall
found
herself
listening
brush
poised
lips
parted
as
though
to
the
exquisite
strains
of
celestial
music
there
came
the
thump
of
a
shoe
on
the
floor
an
interval
of
quiet
then
another
thump
without
having
been
conscious
of
it
emma
mcchesney
had
grown
to
love
the
noises
that
accompanied
jock
retiring
and
rising
his
dressing
was
always
signalized
by
bangings
and
thumpings
his
splashings
in
the
tub
were
tremendous
his
morning
plunge
could
be
heard
all
over
the
apartment
mcchesney
used
to
call
gayly
through
the
door
mercy
jock
you
sound
like
a
school
of
whales
coming
up
for
air
you
think
i
a
school
of
sharks
when
it
comes
to
breakfast
jock
would
call
back
tell
annie
to
make
enough
toast
mum
the
tightest
thing
with
the
toast
i
ever
did
the
rest
would
be
lost
in
a
final
surging
splash
the
noises
in
the
room
across
the
hall
had
subsided
now
she
listened
more
intently
no
a
drawer
banged
another
then
has
my
gray
suit
come
back
from
the
tailor
it
was
to
be
sponged
too
you
know
he
said
he
bring
it
wednesday
this
is
tuesday
oh
another
bang
then
night
mother
good
night
dear
creaking
sounds
then
a
long
comfortable
sigh
of
complete
relaxation
emma
mcchesney
went
on
with
her
brushing
she
brushed
her
hair
with
the
usual
number
of
swift
even
strokes
from
the
top
of
the
shining
head
to
the
waist
she
braided
her
hair
into
two
plaits
gretchen
fashion
millions
of
women
would
have
given
all
they
possessed
to
look
as
emma
mcchesney
looked
standing
there
in
kimono
and
gown
she
nicked
out
the
light
then
she
too
relaxed
upon
her
pillow
with
a
little
sigh
quiet
fell
on
the
little
apartment
the
street
noises
came
up
to
her
now
roaring
now
growing
faint
emma
mcchesney
lay
there
sleepless
she
lay
flat
hands
clasped
across
her
breast
her
braids
spread
out
on
the
pillow
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
the
years
rolled
before
her
in
panorama
her
girlhood
her
marriage
her
unhappiness
jock
the
divorce
the
struggle
for
work
those
ten
years
on
the
road
those
ten
years
on
the
road
how
she
had
hated
them
and
loved
them
the
stuffy
trains
the
jarring
sleepers
the
bare
little
hotel
bedrooms
the
bad
food
the
irregular
hours
the
loneliness
the
hard
work
the
disappointments
the
temptations
yes
but
the
fascination
of
it
the
dear
friends
she
had
made
the
great
human
lesson
of
it
all
and
all
for
jock
that
jock
might
have
good
schools
good
clothes
good
books
good
surroundings
happy
times
why
jock
had
been
the
reason
for
it
all
she
had
swallowed
insult
because
of
jock
she
had
borne
the
drudgery
because
of
jock
she
had
resisted
temptation
smiled
under
hardship
worked
fought
saved
succeeded
all
because
of
jock
and
now
this
pivot
about
which
her
whole
life
had
revolved
was
to
be
pulled
up
wrenched
away
over
emma
mcchesney
lying
there
in
the
dark
there
swept
one
of
those
unreasoning
the
fear
of
living
the
fear
of
life
a
straining
of
the
eyeballs
in
the
dark
the
pounding
of
she
sat
up
in
bed
her
hands
went
to
her
face
her
cheeks
were
burning
and
her
eyes
smarted
she
felt
that
she
must
see
jock
at
once
just
to
be
near
him
to
touch
him
to
take
him
in
her
arms
with
his
head
in
the
hollow
of
her
breast
as
she
used
to
when
he
was
a
baby
why
he
had
been
a
baby
only
yesterday
and
now
he
was
a
man
big
enough
to
stand
alone
to
live
alone
to
do
without
her
emma
mcchesney
flung
aside
the
covers
and
sprang
out
of
bed
she
thrust
her
feet
in
slippers
groped
for
the
kimono
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
tiptoed
to
the
door
she
listened
no
sound
from
the
other
room
she
stole
across
the
hall
stopped
listened
gained
the
door
it
was
open
an
inch
or
more
just
to
be
near
him
to
know
that
he
lay
there
sleeping
she
pushed
the
door
very
very
gently
then
she
stood
in
the
doorway
a
moment
scarcely
breathing
her
head
thrust
forward
her
whole
body
tense
with
listening
she
could
not
hear
him
breathe
she
caught
her
breath
again
in
that
unreasoning
fear
and
took
a
quick
step
forward
stop
or
i
shoot
said
a
voice
simultaneously
the
light
flashed
on
emma
mcchesney
found
herself
blinking
at
a
determined
young
man
who
was
steadily
pointing
a
short
chubby
businesslike
looking
steel
affair
in
her
direction
then
the
hand
that
held
the
steel
dropped
what
is
this
anyway
demanded
jock
rather
crossly
a
george
cohan
comedy
emma
mcchesney
leaned
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
rather
weakly
what
did
you
think
what
would
you
think
if
you
heard
some
one
come
sneaking
along
the
hall
stopping
listening
sneaking
to
your
door
and
then
opening
it
and
listening
again
and
sneaking
in
what
would
you
think
it
was
how
did
i
know
you
were
going
around
making
social
calls
at
two
in
the
morning
suddenly
emma
mcchesney
began
to
laugh
she
leaned
over
the
footboard
and
laughed
hysterically
her
head
in
her
arms
jock
stared
a
moment
in
offended
disapproval
then
the
humor
of
it
caught
him
and
he
buried
his
head
in
his
pillow
to
stifle
unseemly
shrieks
his
legs
kicked
spasmodically
beneath
the
bedclothes
as
suddenly
as
she
had
begun
to
laugh
mcchesney
became
very
sober
stop
it
jock
tell
me
why
were
you
sleeping
i
do
know
replied
jock
as
suddenly
solemn
i
sort
of
began
to
think
and
i
could
sleep
what
were
you
thinking
of
jock
looked
down
at
the
bedclothes
and
traced
a
pattern
with
one
forefinger
on
the
sheet
then
he
looked
up
thinking
of
you
oh
said
emma
mcchesney
like
a
bashful
schoolgirl
of
me
jock
sat
up
very
straight
and
clasped
his
hands
about
his
knees
i
got
to
thinking
of
what
i
had
said
about
having
made
good
all
alone
that
rot
it
is
so
i
was
striped
with
yellow
like
a
stick
of
lemon
candy
if
i
got
this
far
it
all
because
of
you
i
been
thinking
all
along
that
i
was
the
original
electric
when
you
really
had
to
get
out
and
crank
me
every
few
miles
into
emma
mcchesney
face
there
came
a
wonderful
look
it
was
the
sort
of
look
with
which
a
angel
might
receive
her
crown
and
harp
it
was
the
look
with
which
a
sees
the
medal
pinned
on
his
breast
it
was
the
look
of
one
who
has
come
into
her
reward
therefore
what
nonsense
said
emma
mcchesney
if
you
had
had
it
in
you
it
would
have
come
out
it
was
in
me
in
the
first
place
contested
jock
stubbornly
you
planted
it
from
her
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
looked
at
him
her
eyes
glowing
brighter
and
brighter
with
that
wonderful
look
now
see
here
severely
i
want
you
to
go
to
sleep
i
intend
to
stand
here
and
dispute
about
your
ethical
innards
at
this
hour
i
going
to
kiss
you
again
oh
well
if
you
must
grinned
jock
resignedly
and
folded
her
in
a
to
emma
mcchesney
it
seemed
that
the
next
three
weeks
leaped
by
not
by
days
but
in
one
great
bound
and
the
day
came
when
a
little
chattering
animated
group
clustered
about
the
slim
young
chap
who
was
fumbling
with
his
tickets
glancing
at
his
watch
signaling
a
porter
for
his
bags
talking
laughing
trying
to
hide
the
pangs
of
departure
under
a
cloak
of
gayety
and
badinage
that
deceived
no
one
least
of
all
did
it
deceive
the
two
women
who
stood
there
the
eyes
of
the
older
woman
never
left
his
face
the
eyes
of
the
younger
one
seldom
were
raised
to
his
but
she
saw
his
every
expression
once
emma
mcchesney
eyes
shifted
a
little
so
as
to
include
both
the
girl
and
the
boy
in
her
gaze
grace
galt
in
her
blue
serge
and
smart
blue
hat
was
worth
a
separate
glance
sam
hupp
was
there
buck
hopper
who
was
to
be
with
him
in
chicago
for
the
first
few
weeks
three
or
four
of
the
younger
men
in
the
office
frankly
envious
and
heartily
congratulatory
they
followed
him
to
his
train
all
laughter
and
animation
if
this
train
does
go
in
two
minutes
said
jock
i
get
scared
and
chuck
the
whole
business
funny
but
i
not
so
keen
on
going
as
i
was
three
weeks
ago
his
eyes
rested
on
the
girl
in
the
blue
serge
and
the
smart
hat
emma
mcchesney
saw
that
she
saw
that
his
eyes
still
rested
there
as
he
stood
on
the
observation
platform
when
the
train
pulled
out
the
sight
did
not
pain
her
as
she
thought
it
would
there
was
success
in
every
line
of
him
as
he
stood
there
hat
in
hand
there
was
assurance
in
every
breath
of
him
his
clothes
his
skin
his
clear
eyes
his
slim
body
all
were
as
they
should
be
he
had
made
a
place
in
the
world
he
was
to
be
a
builder
of
ideas
she
thought
of
him
and
of
the
girl
in
blue
serge
and
of
their
her
breast
swelled
exultingly
her
head
came
up
this
was
her
handiwork
she
looked
at
it
and
found
that
it
was
good
let
strike
for
the
afternoon
and
call
it
a
holiday
suggested
buck
emma
mcchesney
turned
the
train
was
gone
you
never
grow
up
never
want
to
come
on
let
play
hooky
emma
ca
i
a
dozen
letters
to
get
out
and
miss
loeb
wants
to
show
me
that
new
design
of
hers
they
drove
back
to
the
office
almost
in
silence
emma
mcchesney
made
straight
for
her
desk
and
began
dictating
letters
with
an
energy
that
bordered
on
fury
at
five
she
was
still
working
at
buck
came
in
to
find
her
still
surrounded
by
papers
samples
models
what
is
this
he
demanded
wrathfully
an
session
emma
mcchesney
looked
up
from
her
desk
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
bright
but
there
was
about
her
an
indefinable
air
of
weariness
i
afraid
to
go
home
i
rattle
around
in
that
empty
flat
like
a
hickory
nut
in
a
barrel
we
have
dinner
and
go
to
the
theater
no
use
i
have
to
go
home
sometime
now
emma
remonstrated
buck
you
soon
get
used
to
it
think
of
all
the
years
you
got
along
without
him
you
were
happy
were
you
happy
because
i
had
somebody
to
work
for
somebody
to
plan
for
somebody
to
worry
about
when
i
think
of
what
that
flat
will
be
without
him
why
just
to
wake
up
and
know
that
you
can
say
good
morning
to
some
one
who
cares
that
worth
living
for
is
it
emma
said
evenly
do
you
realize
that
you
are
virtually
hounding
me
into
asking
you
to
marry
me
gasped
emma
mcchesney
well
you
said
you
wanted
somebody
to
worry
about
did
you
illustration
you
said
you
wanted
somebody
to
worry
about
did
you
a
little
whimsical
smile
lay
lightly
on
his
lips
timothy
buck
i
over
forty
years
old
emma
in
another
minute
i
going
to
grow
sentimental
and
nothing
can
stop
me
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
there
fell
a
little
silence
buck
stirred
leaned
forward
she
looked
up
from
the
little
watch
that
ticked
away
at
her
wrist
the
minute
up
said
emma
mcchesney
the
end
