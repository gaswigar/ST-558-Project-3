chapter
i
the
frowsy
chambermaid
of
the
red
lion
had
just
finished
washing
the
front
door
steps
she
rose
from
her
stooping
posture
and
being
of
slovenly
habit
flung
the
water
from
her
pail
straight
out
without
moving
from
where
she
stood
the
smooth
round
arch
of
the
falling
water
glistened
for
a
moment
in
john
gourlay
standing
in
front
of
his
new
house
at
the
head
of
the
brae
could
hear
the
swash
of
it
when
it
fell
the
morning
was
of
perfect
stillness
the
hands
of
the
clock
across
the
square
were
pointing
to
the
hour
of
eight
they
were
yellow
in
the
sun
blowsalinda
of
the
red
lion
picked
up
the
big
bass
that
usually
lay
within
the
porch
and
carrying
it
clumsily
against
her
breast
moved
off
round
the
corner
of
the
her
petticoat
gaping
behind
halfway
she
met
the
hostler
with
whom
she
stopped
in
amorous
dalliance
he
said
something
to
her
and
she
laughed
loudly
and
vacantly
the
silly
echoed
up
the
street
a
moment
later
a
cloud
of
dust
drifting
round
the
corner
and
floating
white
in
the
still
air
showed
that
she
was
pounding
the
bass
against
the
end
of
the
house
all
over
the
little
town
the
women
of
barbie
were
equally
busy
with
their
steps
and
there
was
scarce
a
man
to
be
seen
either
in
the
square
at
the
top
of
which
gourlay
stood
or
in
the
long
street
descending
from
its
near
corner
the
men
were
at
work
the
children
had
not
yet
appeared
the
women
were
busy
with
their
household
cares
the
freshness
of
the
air
the
smoke
rising
thin
and
far
above
the
red
chimneys
the
sunshine
glistering
on
the
roofs
and
gables
the
rosy
clearness
of
everything
beneath
the
dawn
above
all
the
quietness
and
peace
made
barbie
usually
so
poor
to
see
a
very
pleasant
place
to
look
down
at
on
a
summer
morning
at
this
hour
there
was
an
unfamiliar
delicacy
in
the
familiar
scene
a
freshness
and
purity
of
aspect
almost
an
unearthliness
as
though
you
viewed
it
through
a
crystal
dream
but
it
was
not
the
beauty
of
the
hour
that
kept
gourlay
musing
at
his
gate
he
was
dead
to
the
fairness
of
the
scene
even
while
the
fact
of
its
presence
there
before
him
wove
most
subtly
with
his
mood
he
smoked
in
silent
enjoyment
because
on
a
morning
such
as
this
everything
he
saw
was
a
delicate
flattery
to
his
pride
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
day
to
look
down
on
the
petty
burgh
in
which
he
was
the
greatest
man
filled
all
his
being
with
a
consciousness
of
importance
his
sense
of
prosperity
was
soothing
and
pervasive
he
felt
it
all
round
him
like
the
pleasant
air
as
real
as
that
and
as
subtle
bathing
him
caressing
it
was
the
most
secret
and
intimate
joy
of
his
life
to
go
out
and
smoke
on
summer
mornings
by
his
big
gate
musing
over
barbie
ere
he
possessed
it
with
his
merchandise
he
had
growled
at
the
quarry
carters
for
being
late
in
setting
out
this
morning
for
like
most
resolute
dullards
he
was
sternly
methodical
but
in
his
heart
he
was
secretly
pleased
the
needs
of
his
business
were
so
various
that
his
men
could
rarely
start
at
the
same
hour
and
in
the
same
direction
however
because
of
the
delay
all
his
carts
would
go
streaming
through
the
town
together
and
that
brave
pomp
would
be
a
slap
in
the
face
to
his
enemies
i
show
them
he
thought
proudly
them
was
the
and
what
he
would
show
them
was
what
a
big
man
he
was
for
like
most
scorners
of
the
world
opinion
gourlay
was
its
slave
and
showed
his
subjection
to
the
popular
estimate
by
his
anxiety
to
flout
it
he
was
not
great
enough
for
the
carelessness
of
perfect
scorn
through
the
big
green
gate
behind
him
came
the
sound
of
carts
being
loaded
for
the
day
a
horse
weary
of
standing
idle
between
the
shafts
kicked
ceaselessly
and
steadily
against
the
ground
with
one
impatient
hinder
foot
clink
clink
clink
upon
the
paved
yard
easy
damn
ye
ye
smash
the
bricks
came
a
voice
then
there
was
the
smart
slap
of
an
open
hand
on
a
sleek
neck
a
quick
start
and
the
rattle
of
chains
as
the
horse
quivered
to
the
blow
run
a
white
tarpaulin
across
the
cheese
jock
to
keep
them
frae
melting
in
the
heat
came
another
voice
and
canny
on
the
top
there
wi
thae
big
feet
o
yours
d
think
a
cheese
was
made
for
to
dance
on
wi
your
mighty
brogues
then
the
voice
sank
to
the
hoarse
warning
whisper
of
impatience
loudish
in
anxiety
yet
throaty
from
fear
of
being
heard
hurry
up
man
hurry
up
or
he
be
down
on
us
like
bleezes
for
being
so
late
in
getting
off
gourlay
smiled
grimly
and
a
black
gleam
shot
from
his
eye
as
he
glanced
round
to
the
gate
and
caught
the
words
his
men
did
not
know
he
could
hear
them
the
clock
across
the
square
struck
the
hour
eight
soft
slow
strokes
that
melted
away
in
the
beauty
of
the
morning
five
minutes
passed
gourlay
turned
his
head
to
listen
but
no
further
sound
came
from
the
yard
he
walked
to
the
green
gate
his
slippers
making
no
noise
are
ye
sleeping
my
pretty
men
he
said
softly
the
leapt
like
a
sword
with
a
slicing
sharpness
in
its
tone
that
made
it
a
sinister
contrast
to
the
first
sweet
question
to
his
pretty
men
he
said
again
and
stared
with
open
mouth
and
fierce
dark
eyes
hurry
up
peter
whispered
the
gaffer
hurry
up
for
god
sake
he
has
the
black
glower
in
his
een
ready
sir
ready
now
cried
peter
riney
running
out
to
open
the
other
half
of
the
gate
peter
was
a
wizened
little
man
with
a
sandy
fringe
of
beard
beneath
his
chin
a
wart
on
the
end
of
his
long
nose
light
blue
eyes
and
bushy
eyebrows
of
a
reddish
gray
the
bearded
red
brows
close
above
the
pale
blueness
of
his
eyes
made
them
more
vivid
by
contrast
they
were
like
pools
of
blue
light
amid
the
brownness
of
his
face
peter
always
ran
about
his
work
with
eager
alacrity
a
simple
and
willing
old
man
he
affected
the
quick
readiness
of
youth
to
atone
for
his
insignificance
hup
horse
hup
then
cried
courageous
peter
walking
backwards
with
curved
body
through
the
gate
and
tugging
at
the
reins
of
a
horse
the
feet
of
which
struck
sparks
from
the
paved
ground
as
they
stressed
painfully
on
edge
to
get
weigh
on
the
great
wagon
behind
the
cart
rolled
through
then
another
and
another
till
twelve
of
them
had
passed
gourlay
stood
aside
to
watch
them
all
the
horses
were
brown
he
makes
a
point
of
that
the
neighbours
would
have
told
you
as
each
horse
passed
the
gate
the
driver
left
its
head
and
took
his
place
by
the
wheel
cracking
his
whip
with
many
a
hup
horse
yean
horse
woa
lad
steady
in
a
dull
little
country
town
the
passing
of
a
single
cart
is
an
event
and
a
gig
is
followed
with
the
eye
till
it
disappears
anything
is
welcome
that
breaks
the
long
monotony
of
the
hours
and
suggests
a
topic
for
the
evening
talk
any
news
a
body
will
gravely
inquire
ou
ay
another
will
answer
with
equal
gravity
i
saw
kennedy
gig
going
past
in
the
forenoon
ay
man
where
would
be
off
till
he
owre
often
in
his
gig
i
thinking
and
then
kennedy
and
his
affairs
will
last
them
till
bedtime
thus
the
appearance
of
gourlay
carts
woke
barbie
from
its
morning
lethargy
the
smith
came
out
in
his
leather
apron
shoving
back
as
he
gazed
the
grimy
cap
from
his
brow
bowed
old
men
stood
in
front
of
their
doorways
leaning
with
one
hand
on
short
trembling
staffs
while
the
slaver
slid
unheeded
along
the
cutties
which
the
left
hand
held
to
their
toothless
mouths
grannies
were
keeking
past
the
jambs
an
early
urchin
standing
to
stare
waved
his
cap
and
shouted
hooray
and
all
because
john
gourlay
carts
were
setting
off
upon
their
morning
rounds
a
brave
procession
for
a
single
town
gourlay
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
took
in
every
detail
devoured
it
grimly
as
a
homage
to
his
pride
ha
ha
ye
dogs
said
the
soul
within
him
past
the
pillar
of
the
red
lion
door
he
could
see
a
white
peep
of
the
landlord
waistcoat
though
the
rest
of
the
mountainous
man
was
hidden
deep
within
his
porch
on
summer
mornings
the
vast
totality
of
the
landlord
was
always
inferential
to
the
town
from
the
tiny
white
peep
of
him
revealed
even
fat
simpson
had
waddled
to
the
door
to
see
the
carts
going
past
it
was
fat
simpson
might
the
universe
blast
his
adipose
who
had
once
tried
to
infringe
gourlay
monopoly
as
the
sole
carrier
in
barbie
there
had
been
a
rush
to
him
at
first
but
gourlay
set
his
teeth
and
drove
him
off
the
road
carrying
stuff
for
nothing
till
simpson
had
nothing
to
carry
so
that
the
local
wit
suggested
a
wee
parcel
in
a
big
cart
as
a
new
sign
for
his
hotel
the
twelve
browns
prancing
past
would
be
a
pill
to
simpson
there
was
no
smile
about
gourlay
mouth
a
fiercer
glower
was
the
only
sign
of
his
pride
but
it
put
a
bloom
on
his
morning
he
felt
to
see
the
suggestive
round
of
simpson
waistcoat
down
yonder
at
the
porch
simpson
the
swine
he
had
made
short
work
o
ere
the
last
of
the
carts
had
issued
from
the
yard
at
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
the
foremost
was
already
near
the
red
lion
gourlay
swore
beneath
his
breath
when
miss
toddle
described
in
the
local
records
as
a
spinster
of
independent
means
came
fluttering
out
with
a
silly
little
parcel
to
accost
one
of
the
carriers
did
the
auld
fool
mean
to
stop
andy
gow
about
petty
affairs
and
thus
break
the
line
of
carts
on
the
only
morning
they
had
ever
been
able
to
go
down
the
brae
together
but
no
andy
tossed
her
parcel
carelessly
up
among
his
other
packages
and
left
her
bawling
instructions
from
the
gutter
with
a
portentous
shaking
of
her
corkscrew
curls
gourlay
men
took
their
cue
from
their
master
and
were
contemptuous
of
barbie
most
unchivalrous
scorners
of
its
old
maids
gourlay
was
pleased
with
andy
for
snubbing
sandy
toddle
sister
when
he
and
elshie
hogg
reached
the
cross
they
would
have
to
break
off
from
the
rest
to
complete
their
loads
but
they
had
been
down
main
street
over
night
as
usual
picking
up
their
commissions
and
until
they
reached
the
bend
o
the
brae
it
was
unlikely
that
any
business
should
arrest
them
now
gourlay
hoped
that
it
might
be
so
and
he
had
his
desire
for
with
the
exception
of
miss
toddle
no
customer
appeared
the
teams
went
slowly
down
the
steep
side
of
the
square
in
an
unbroken
line
and
slowly
down
the
street
leading
from
its
near
corner
on
the
slope
the
horses
were
unable
to
go
fast
being
forced
to
stell
themselves
back
against
the
heavy
propulsion
of
the
carts
behind
and
thus
the
procession
endured
for
a
length
of
time
worthy
its
surpassing
greatness
when
it
disappeared
round
the
bend
o
the
brae
the
watching
bodies
disappeared
too
the
event
of
the
day
had
passed
and
vacancy
resumed
her
reign
the
street
and
the
square
lay
empty
to
the
morning
sun
gourlay
alone
stood
idly
at
his
gate
lapped
in
his
own
satisfaction
it
had
been
a
big
morning
he
felt
it
was
the
first
time
for
many
a
year
that
all
his
men
quarrymen
and
carriers
carters
of
cheese
and
carters
of
grain
had
led
their
teams
down
the
brae
together
in
the
full
view
of
his
rivals
i
hope
they
liked
it
he
thought
and
he
nodded
several
times
at
the
town
beneath
his
feet
with
a
slow
motion
of
the
head
like
a
man
nodding
grimly
to
his
beaten
enemy
it
was
as
if
he
said
see
what
i
have
done
to
ye
chapter
ii
only
a
man
of
gourlay
brute
force
of
character
could
have
kept
all
the
carrying
trade
of
barbie
in
his
own
hands
even
in
these
days
of
railways
nearly
every
parish
has
a
pair
of
carriers
at
the
least
journeying
once
or
twice
a
week
to
the
nearest
town
in
the
days
when
gourlay
was
the
great
man
of
barbie
railways
were
only
beginning
to
thrust
themselves
among
the
quiet
hills
and
the
bulk
of
inland
commerce
was
still
being
drawn
by
horses
along
the
country
roads
yet
gourlay
was
the
only
carrier
in
the
town
the
wonder
is
diminished
when
we
remember
that
it
had
been
a
decaying
burgh
for
thirty
years
and
that
its
trade
at
the
best
of
times
was
of
meagre
volume
even
so
it
was
astonishing
that
he
should
be
the
only
carrier
if
you
asked
the
natives
how
he
did
it
ou
they
said
he
makes
the
one
hand
wash
the
other
doa
ye
know
meaning
thereby
that
he
had
so
many
horses
travelling
on
his
own
business
that
he
could
afford
to
carry
other
people
goods
at
rates
that
must
cripple
his
rivals
but
that
very
stupid
surely
said
a
visitor
once
who
thought
of
entering
into
competition
it
cutting
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
face
why
is
he
so
anxious
to
be
the
only
carrier
in
barbie
that
he
carries
stuff
for
next
to
noathing
the
moment
another
man
tries
to
work
the
roads
it
a
thing
to
do
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
just
the
stupeedity
o
spite
oh
there
are
times
when
gourlay
makes
little
or
noathing
from
the
carrying
but
then
ye
see
it
gies
him
a
fine
chance
to
annoy
folk
if
you
ask
him
to
bring
ye
ocht
he
growls
see
if
it
suits
my
own
convenience
and
ye
have
to
be
content
he
has
made
so
much
money
of
late
that
the
pride
of
him
not
to
be
endured
it
was
not
the
insolence
of
sudden
wealth
however
that
made
gourlay
haughty
to
his
neighbours
it
was
a
repressiveness
natural
to
the
man
and
a
fierce
contempt
of
their
scoffing
envy
but
it
was
true
that
he
had
made
large
sums
of
money
during
recent
years
from
his
father
who
had
risen
in
the
world
he
inherited
a
fine
trade
in
cheese
also
the
carrying
to
skeighan
on
the
one
side
and
fleckie
on
the
other
when
he
married
miss
richmond
of
tenshillingland
he
started
as
a
corn
broker
with
the
snug
dowry
that
she
brought
him
then
greatly
to
his
own
benefit
he
succeeded
in
establishing
a
valuable
connection
with
templandmuir
it
was
partly
by
sheer
impact
of
character
that
gourlay
obtained
his
ascendency
over
hearty
and
careless
templandmuir
and
partly
by
a
bluff
joviality
which
he
so
little
cunning
in
other
things
knew
to
affect
among
the
petty
lairds
the
man
you
saw
trying
to
be
jocose
with
templandmuir
was
a
very
different
being
from
the
autocrat
who
downed
his
fellows
in
the
town
it
was
all
how
are
ye
the
day
templandmuir
and
how
d
mr
gourlay
and
the
immediate
production
of
the
big
decanter
more
than
ten
years
ago
now
templandmuir
gave
this
fine
dour
upstanding
friend
of
his
a
tack
of
the
red
quarry
and
that
was
the
making
of
gourlay
the
quarry
yielded
the
best
building
stone
in
a
circuit
of
thirty
miles
easy
to
work
and
hard
against
wind
and
weather
when
the
main
line
went
north
through
skeighan
and
poltandie
there
was
a
great
deal
of
building
on
the
far
side
and
gourlay
simply
coined
the
money
he
could
not
have
exhausted
the
quarry
had
he
tried
he
would
have
had
to
howk
down
a
hill
but
he
took
thousands
of
loads
from
it
for
the
skeighan
folk
and
the
commission
he
paid
the
laird
on
each
was
ridiculously
small
he
built
wooden
stables
out
on
estate
the
templar
had
seven
hundred
acres
of
hill
land
and
it
was
there
the
quarry
horses
generally
stood
it
was
only
rarely
once
in
two
years
perhaps
that
they
came
into
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
last
saturday
they
had
brought
several
loads
of
stuff
for
gourlay
own
use
and
that
is
why
they
were
present
at
the
great
procession
on
the
monday
following
it
was
their
feeling
that
gourlay
success
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
merits
that
made
other
so
bitter
against
him
they
were
an
able
lot
and
scarce
one
but
possessed
fifty
times
his
weight
of
brain
yet
he
had
the
big
way
of
doing
though
most
of
them
were
well
enough
to
pass
had
they
not
been
aware
of
his
stupidity
they
would
never
have
minded
his
triumphs
in
the
countryside
but
they
felt
it
with
a
sense
of
personal
defeat
that
he
the
donkey
as
they
thought
him
should
scoop
every
chance
that
was
going
and
leave
them
the
ones
still
muddling
in
their
old
concerns
they
consoled
themselves
with
sneers
he
retorted
with
brutal
scorn
and
the
feud
kept
increasing
between
them
they
were
standing
at
the
cross
to
enjoy
their
saturday
at
when
gourlay
quarriers
as
the
quarry
horses
had
been
named
came
through
the
town
last
there
were
groups
of
bodies
in
the
streets
washed
from
toil
to
enjoy
the
quiet
air
dandering
slowly
or
gossiping
at
ease
and
they
all
turned
to
watch
the
quarriers
stepping
bravely
up
their
heads
tossing
to
the
hill
the
glowered
and
said
nothing
i
would
mind
said
sandy
toddle
at
last
i
would
mind
if
he
were
such
a
demned
ess
ess
said
the
deacon
unpleasantly
he
puckered
his
brow
and
blinked
pretending
not
to
understand
oh
a
cuddy
ye
know
said
toddle
colouring
stupid
enough
lisped
the
deacon
we
all
know
that
but
one
thing
to
be
said
on
hith
behalf
he
not
such
a
ess
as
to
try
and
thpeak
fancy
english
when
the
deacon
was
not
afraid
of
a
man
he
stabbed
him
straight
when
he
was
afraid
of
him
he
stabbed
him
on
the
sly
he
was
annoyed
by
the
passing
of
gourlay
carts
and
he
took
it
out
of
sandy
toddle
it
blurted
the
provost
who
was
a
man
of
brosy
speech
and
fat
of
utterance
it
yass
i
mean
the
luck
of
that
man
for
gumption
he
has
noan
noan
whatever
but
if
the
railway
came
hereaway
i
wager
gourlay
would
go
down
he
added
less
in
certainty
of
knowledge
than
as
prophet
of
the
thing
desired
i
wager
he
go
down
sirs
likely
enough
said
sandy
toddle
he
would
be
quick
enough
to
jump
at
the
new
way
of
doing
moar
than
that
cried
the
provost
spite
sharpening
his
insight
moar
than
that
he
be
owre
dour
to
abandon
the
auld
way
talling
ye
he
would
just
be
left
entirely
it
only
those
like
myself
who
approach
him
on
the
town
affairs
that
know
the
full
extent
of
his
stupeedity
oh
he
a
ess
said
the
deacon
rubbing
it
into
toddle
and
gourlay
at
the
same
time
but
then
ye
see
he
has
the
abeelity
that
comes
from
character
said
johnny
coe
who
was
a
sage
philosopher
for
there
are
two
kinds
of
abeelity
do
ye
there
a
scattered
abeelity
that
of
no
use
auld
randie
donaldson
was
good
at
fifty
different
things
and
he
died
in
the
poorhouse
there
a
dour
kind
of
abeelity
though
that
has
no
cleverness
but
just
gangs
tramping
on
and
that
the
easiest
beaten
by
a
flank
attack
said
the
deacon
snubbing
him
chapter
iii
with
the
sudden
start
of
a
man
roused
from
a
daydream
gourlay
turned
from
the
green
gate
and
entered
the
yard
jock
gilmour
the
orra
man
was
washing
down
the
legs
of
a
horse
beside
the
trough
it
was
own
cob
which
he
used
for
driving
round
the
countryside
it
was
a
black
gourlay
made
a
point
of
driving
with
a
black
the
brown
for
sturdiness
the
black
for
speed
he
would
say
making
a
maxim
of
his
whim
to
give
it
the
sanction
of
a
higher
law
gilmour
was
in
a
wild
temper
because
he
had
been
forced
to
get
up
at
five
in
order
to
turn
several
hundred
cheeses
to
prevent
them
bulging
out
of
shape
owing
to
the
heat
and
so
becoming
cracked
and
spoiled
he
did
not
raise
his
head
at
his
master
approach
and
his
head
being
bent
the
eye
was
attracted
to
a
patent
leather
collar
which
he
wore
glazed
with
black
and
red
stripes
it
is
a
collar
much
affected
by
ploughmen
because
a
dip
in
the
once
a
month
suffices
for
its
washing
between
the
striped
collar
and
his
hair
as
he
stooped
the
sunburnt
redness
of
his
neck
struck
the
eye
vividly
the
cropped
fair
hairs
on
it
showing
whitish
on
the
red
skin
the
horse
quivered
as
the
cold
water
swashed
about
its
legs
and
turned
playfully
to
bite
its
groom
gilmour
still
stooping
dug
his
elbow
up
beneath
its
ribs
the
animal
wheeled
in
anger
but
gilmour
ran
to
its
head
with
most
manful
blasphemy
and
led
it
to
the
stable
door
the
off
hind
leg
was
still
unwashed
has
the
horse
but
the
three
legs
said
gourlay
suavely
gilmour
brought
the
horse
back
to
the
trough
muttering
sullenly
were
ye
saying
anything
said
gourlay
gilmour
sulked
out
and
said
nothing
and
his
master
smiled
grimly
at
the
sudden
redness
that
swelled
his
neck
and
ears
to
the
verge
of
bursting
a
boy
standing
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
at
an
open
window
of
the
house
above
had
looked
down
at
the
scene
with
craning
interest
he
had
been
alive
to
every
turn
and
phase
of
it
the
horse
quiver
of
delight
and
fear
his
skittishness
the
groom
and
gourlay
grinding
will
eh
but
his
father
was
a
caution
how
easy
he
had
downed
jock
gilmour
the
boy
was
afraid
of
his
father
himself
but
he
liked
to
see
him
send
other
folk
to
the
right
about
for
he
was
john
gourlay
too
hokey
but
his
father
could
down
them
gourlay
passed
on
to
the
inner
yard
which
was
close
to
the
scullery
door
the
paved
little
court
within
its
high
wooden
walls
was
curiously
fresh
and
clean
a
strutted
round
puffing
his
gleaming
breast
and
in
the
sun
large
clear
drops
fell
slowly
from
the
spout
of
a
wooden
pump
and
splashed
upon
a
flat
stone
the
place
seemed
to
enfold
the
stillness
there
was
a
sense
of
inclusion
and
peace
there
is
a
distinct
pleasure
to
the
eye
in
a
quiet
brick
court
where
everything
is
fresh
and
prim
in
sunny
weather
you
can
lounge
in
a
room
and
watch
it
through
an
open
door
in
a
kind
of
lazy
dream
the
boy
standing
at
the
window
above
to
let
the
fresh
air
blow
round
his
neck
was
alive
to
that
pleasure
he
was
intensely
conscious
of
the
pigeon
swelling
in
its
bravery
of
the
clean
yard
the
dripping
pump
and
the
great
stillness
his
father
on
the
step
beneath
had
a
different
pleasure
in
the
sight
the
fresh
indolence
of
morning
was
round
him
too
but
it
was
more
than
that
that
kept
him
gazing
in
idle
happiness
he
was
delighting
in
the
sense
of
his
own
property
around
him
the
most
substantial
pleasure
possible
to
man
his
feeling
deep
though
it
was
was
quite
vague
and
inarticulate
if
you
had
asked
gourlay
what
he
was
thinking
of
he
could
not
have
told
you
even
if
he
had
been
willing
to
answer
you
civilly
which
is
most
unlikely
yet
his
whole
being
physical
and
mental
physical
indeed
rather
than
mental
was
surcharged
with
the
feeling
that
the
fine
buildings
around
him
were
his
that
he
had
won
them
by
his
own
effort
and
built
them
large
and
significant
before
the
world
he
was
lapped
in
the
thought
of
it
all
men
are
suffused
with
that
quiet
pride
in
looking
at
the
houses
and
lands
which
they
have
won
by
their
endeavours
in
looking
at
the
houses
more
than
at
the
lands
for
the
house
which
a
man
has
built
seems
to
express
his
character
and
stand
for
him
before
the
world
as
a
sign
of
his
success
it
is
more
personal
than
cold
acres
stamped
with
an
individuality
all
men
know
that
soothing
pride
in
the
contemplation
of
their
own
property
but
in
gourlay
sense
of
property
there
was
another
element
an
element
peculiar
to
itself
which
endowed
it
with
its
warmest
glow
conscious
always
that
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
among
his
cleverer
neighbours
who
could
achieve
a
civic
eminence
denied
to
him
he
felt
nevertheless
that
there
was
one
means
a
material
means
by
which
he
could
hold
his
own
and
reassert
himself
by
the
bravery
of
his
business
namely
and
all
the
appointments
thereof
among
which
his
dwelling
was
the
chief
that
was
why
he
had
spent
so
much
money
on
the
house
that
was
why
he
had
such
keen
delight
in
surveying
it
every
time
he
looked
at
the
place
he
had
a
sense
of
triumph
over
what
he
knew
in
his
bones
to
be
an
adverse
public
opinion
there
was
anger
in
his
pleasure
and
the
pleasure
that
is
mixed
with
anger
often
gives
the
keenest
thrill
it
is
the
delight
of
triumph
in
spite
of
opposition
gourlay
house
was
a
material
expression
of
that
delight
stood
for
it
in
stone
and
lime
it
was
not
that
he
reasoned
deliberately
when
he
built
the
house
but
every
improvement
that
he
made
and
he
was
always
spending
money
on
improvements
had
for
its
secret
motive
a
more
or
less
vague
desire
to
score
off
his
rivals
be
a
slap
in
the
face
to
the
provost
he
smiled
when
he
planted
his
great
mound
of
shrubs
there
noathing
like
about
the
provost
ha
ha
encased
as
he
was
in
his
hard
and
insensitive
nature
he
was
not
the
man
who
in
new
surroundings
would
be
quick
to
every
whisper
of
opinion
but
he
had
been
born
and
bred
in
barbie
and
he
knew
his
townsmen
oh
yes
he
knew
them
he
knew
they
laughed
because
he
had
no
gift
of
the
gab
and
could
never
be
provost
or
bailie
or
elder
or
even
chairman
of
the
gasworks
oh
verra
well
verra
well
let
connal
and
brodie
and
allardyce
have
the
talk
and
manage
the
town
affairs
he
was
damned
if
they
should
manage
his
he
for
his
part
preferred
the
substantial
reality
he
could
never
aspire
to
the
provostship
but
a
man
with
a
house
like
that
he
was
fain
to
think
could
afford
to
do
without
it
oh
yes
he
was
of
opinion
he
could
do
without
it
it
had
run
him
short
of
cash
to
build
the
place
so
big
and
braw
but
lord
it
was
worth
it
there
was
a
man
in
the
town
who
had
such
accommodation
and
so
gradually
his
dwelling
had
come
to
be
a
passion
of
life
it
was
a
in
the
place
that
if
ever
his
ghost
was
seen
it
would
be
haunting
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
deacon
allardyce
trying
to
make
a
phrase
with
him
once
quoted
the
saying
in
his
presence
likely
enough
said
gourlay
it
only
reasonable
i
should
prefer
my
own
house
to
you
rabble
in
the
graveyard
both
in
appearance
and
position
the
house
was
a
worthy
counterpart
of
its
owner
it
was
a
substantial
dwelling
planted
firm
and
gawcey
on
a
little
natural
terrace
that
projected
a
considerable
distance
into
the
square
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
little
bank
shelving
to
the
terrace
ran
a
stone
wall
of
no
great
height
and
the
iron
railings
it
uplifted
were
no
higher
than
the
sward
within
thus
the
whole
house
was
bare
to
the
view
from
the
ground
up
nothing
in
front
to
screen
its
admirable
qualities
from
each
corner
behind
flanking
walls
went
out
to
the
right
and
left
and
hid
the
yard
and
the
granaries
in
front
of
these
walls
the
dwelling
seemed
to
thrust
itself
out
for
notice
it
took
the
eye
of
a
stranger
the
moment
he
entered
the
square
whose
place
is
that
was
his
natural
question
a
house
that
challenges
regard
in
that
way
should
have
a
gallant
bravery
in
its
look
if
its
aspect
be
mean
its
assertive
position
but
directs
the
eye
to
its
infirmities
there
is
something
pathetic
about
a
tall
cold
house
set
high
upon
a
brae
it
can
not
hide
its
naked
shame
it
thrusts
its
ugliness
dumbly
on
your
notice
a
manifest
blotch
upon
the
world
a
place
for
the
winds
to
whistle
round
but
gourlay
house
was
worthy
its
commanding
station
a
little
dour
and
blunt
in
the
outlines
like
gourlay
himself
it
drew
and
satisfied
your
eye
as
he
did
and
its
position
cockit
up
there
on
the
brae
made
it
the
theme
of
constant
remark
to
men
because
of
the
tyrant
who
owned
it
and
to
women
because
of
the
poor
woman
who
mismanaged
its
affairs
i
wonder
that
gurly
gourlay
as
they
ca
him
has
an
ill
temper
said
the
gossips
gathered
at
the
pump
with
their
big
bare
arms
akimbo
whatever
led
him
to
marry
that
dishclout
of
a
woman
clean
beats
i
never
could
make
head
nor
tail
as
for
the
men
they
twisted
every
item
about
gourlay
and
his
domicile
into
fresh
matter
of
assailment
what
the
news
asked
one
returning
from
a
long
absence
to
whom
the
smith
after
smoking
in
silence
for
five
minutes
said
gourlay
has
got
new
rones
ha
ay
man
gourlay
has
got
new
rones
buzzed
the
visitor
and
then
their
eyes
diminished
in
mirth
twinkled
at
each
other
from
out
their
ruddy
wrinkles
as
if
wit
had
volleyed
between
them
in
short
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
was
on
every
tongue
and
with
a
scoff
in
the
voice
if
possible
chapter
iv
gourlay
went
swiftly
to
the
kitchen
from
the
inner
yard
he
had
stood
so
long
in
silence
on
the
step
and
his
coming
was
so
noiseless
that
he
surprised
a
long
thin
trollop
of
a
woman
with
a
long
thin
scraggy
neck
seated
by
the
slatternly
table
and
busy
with
a
frowsy
volume
over
which
her
head
was
bent
in
intent
perusal
at
your
novelles
said
he
ay
woman
will
it
be
a
good
story
she
rose
in
a
nervous
flutter
when
she
saw
him
yet
needlessly
shrill
in
her
defence
because
she
was
angry
at
detection
ah
well
she
cried
in
weary
petulance
it
an
unco
thing
if
a
body
not
to
have
a
moment
rest
after
such
a
morning
darg
i
just
sat
down
wi
the
book
for
a
little
till
john
should
come
till
his
breakfast
so
said
gourlay
god
ay
he
went
on
you
making
a
nice
job
of
be
a
credit
to
the
house
oh
it
right
no
doubt
that
should
neglect
your
work
till
consents
to
rise
eh
the
puir
she
protested
dwelling
on
the
vowels
in
fatuous
maternal
love
the
bairn
wearied
man
he
ainything
but
strong
and
the
schooling
owre
sore
on
him
poor
lamb
atweel
said
gourlay
it
was
a
muckle
sheep
that
dropped
him
it
was
gourlay
pride
in
his
house
that
made
him
harsher
to
his
wife
than
others
since
her
sluttishness
was
a
constant
offence
to
the
order
in
which
he
loved
to
have
his
dear
possessions
he
for
his
part
liked
everything
precise
his
hammer
always
hung
by
the
head
on
a
couple
of
nails
close
together
near
the
big
clock
his
gun
always
lay
across
a
pair
of
wooden
pegs
projecting
from
the
brown
rafters
just
above
the
hearth
his
bigotry
in
trifles
expressed
his
character
strong
men
of
a
mean
understanding
often
deliberately
assume
and
passionately
defend
peculiarities
of
no
importance
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
get
a
repute
for
no
no
said
gourlay
you
never
see
a
brown
cob
in
gig
i
would
take
one
in
a
present
he
was
full
of
such
fads
and
nothing
should
persuade
him
to
alter
the
crotchets
which
for
want
of
something
better
he
made
the
marks
of
his
dour
character
he
had
worked
them
up
as
part
of
his
personality
and
his
pride
of
personality
was
such
that
he
would
never
consent
to
change
them
hence
the
burly
and
gurly
man
was
prim
as
an
old
maid
with
regard
to
his
belongings
yet
his
wife
was
continually
infringing
the
order
on
which
he
set
his
heart
if
he
went
forward
to
the
big
clock
to
look
for
his
hammer
it
was
sure
to
be
gone
the
two
bright
nails
staring
at
him
vacantly
oh
she
would
say
in
weary
complaint
i
just
took
it
to
break
a
wheen
coals
and
he
would
find
it
in
the
greasy
and
grimy
engrained
on
the
handle
which
he
loved
to
keep
so
smooth
and
clean
innumerable
her
offences
of
the
kind
independent
of
these
the
sight
of
her
general
incompetence
filled
him
with
a
seething
rage
which
found
vent
not
in
lengthy
tirades
but
the
smooth
venom
of
his
tongue
let
him
keep
the
outside
of
the
house
never
so
spick
and
span
inside
was
awry
with
her
untidiness
she
was
unworthy
of
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
that
was
the
gist
of
it
every
time
he
set
eyes
on
the
poor
trollop
the
fresh
perception
of
her
incompetence
which
the
sudden
sight
of
her
flashed
as
she
trailed
aimlessly
about
seemed
to
fatten
his
rage
and
give
a
coarser
birr
to
his
tongue
gourlay
had
only
four
people
to
look
after
her
husband
her
two
children
and
jock
gilmour
the
orra
man
and
the
wife
of
drucken
wabster
who
had
to
go
charing
because
she
was
the
wife
of
drucken
wabster
came
in
every
day
and
all
day
long
to
help
her
with
the
work
yet
the
house
was
always
in
confusion
gourlay
had
asked
for
another
servant
but
gourlay
would
not
allow
that
one
enough
said
he
and
what
he
once
laid
down
he
never
went
back
on
gourlay
had
to
muddle
along
as
best
she
could
and
having
no
strength
either
of
mind
or
body
she
let
things
drift
and
took
refuge
in
reading
silly
fiction
as
gourlay
shoved
his
feet
into
his
boots
and
stamped
to
make
them
easy
he
glowered
at
the
kitchen
from
under
his
heavy
brows
with
a
huge
disgust
the
table
was
littered
with
unwashed
dishes
and
on
the
corner
of
it
next
him
was
a
great
black
sloppy
ring
showing
where
a
wet
saucepan
had
been
laid
upon
the
bare
board
the
sun
streamed
through
the
window
in
yellow
heat
right
on
to
a
pat
of
melting
butter
there
was
a
basin
of
dirty
water
beneath
the
table
with
the
dishcloth
slopping
over
on
the
ground
it
a
tidy
house
said
he
ach
well
she
cried
you
and
your
it
was
that
that
did
it
the
masons
could
have
redd
out
the
fireplace
to
make
room
in
the
afternoon
before
it
comes
hame
they
could
have
brawly
but
ye
wouldna
hear
oh
no
ye
bude
to
have
the
whole
place
gutted
out
yestreen
i
had
to
boil
everything
on
the
parlour
fire
this
morning
no
wonder
i
a
little
tousy
the
kitchen
grate
had
been
removed
and
the
jambs
had
been
widened
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
it
yawned
empty
and
cold
a
little
rubble
of
mortar
newly
dried
lay
about
the
bottom
of
the
square
recess
the
sight
of
the
crude
unfamiliar
scraps
of
dropped
lime
in
the
gaping
place
where
warmth
should
have
been
increased
the
discomfort
of
the
kitchen
oh
that
it
said
gourlay
i
see
it
was
want
of
the
fireplace
that
kept
ye
from
washing
the
dishes
that
we
used
yestreen
that
was
terrible
however
ye
have
plenty
of
boiling
water
when
i
put
in
the
grand
new
range
for
ye
there
winna
be
its
equal
in
the
parish
maybe
have
a
clean
house
gourlay
leaned
with
the
outspread
thumb
and
red
raw
knuckles
of
her
right
hand
on
the
sloppy
table
and
gazed
away
through
the
back
window
of
the
kitchen
in
a
kind
of
mournful
vacancy
always
when
her
first
complaining
defence
had
failed
to
turn
aside
her
husband
tongue
her
mind
became
a
blank
beneath
his
heavy
sarcasms
and
sought
refuge
by
drifting
far
away
she
would
fix
her
eyes
on
the
distance
in
dreary
contemplation
and
her
mind
would
follow
her
eyes
in
a
vacant
and
wistful
regard
the
preoccupation
of
her
mournful
gaze
enabled
her
to
meet
her
husband
sneers
with
a
kind
of
numb
unheeding
acquiescence
she
scarcely
heard
them
her
head
hung
a
little
to
one
side
as
if
too
heavy
for
her
wilting
neck
her
hair
of
a
dry
red
brown
curved
low
on
either
side
of
her
brow
in
a
thick
untidy
mass
to
her
almost
transparent
ears
as
she
gazed
in
weary
and
dreary
absorption
her
lips
had
fallen
heavy
and
relaxed
in
unison
with
her
mood
and
through
her
open
mouth
her
breathing
was
quick
and
short
and
noiseless
she
wore
no
stays
and
her
slack
cotton
blouse
showed
the
flatness
of
her
bosom
and
the
faint
outlines
of
her
withered
and
pendulous
breasts
hanging
low
within
there
was
something
tragic
in
her
pose
as
she
stood
sad
and
abstracted
by
the
dirty
table
she
was
scraggy
helplessness
staring
in
sorrowful
vacancy
but
gourlay
eyed
her
with
disgust
why
by
heaven
even
now
her
petticoat
was
gaping
behind
worse
than
the
sloven
at
the
red
lion
she
was
a
wife
for
john
gourlay
the
sight
of
her
feebleness
would
have
roused
pity
in
some
gourlay
it
moved
to
a
steady
and
seething
rage
as
she
stood
helpless
before
him
he
stung
her
with
crude
brief
irony
yet
he
was
not
wilfully
cruel
only
a
stupid
man
with
a
strong
character
in
which
he
took
a
dogged
pride
stupidity
and
pride
provoked
the
brute
in
him
he
was
so
dull
only
dull
is
hardly
the
word
for
a
man
of
his
smouldering
fire
he
was
so
dour
of
wit
that
he
could
never
hope
to
distinguish
himself
by
anything
in
the
shape
of
cleverness
yet
so
resolute
a
man
must
make
the
strong
personality
of
which
he
was
proud
tell
in
some
way
how
then
should
he
assert
his
superiority
and
hold
his
own
only
by
affecting
a
brutal
scorn
of
everything
said
and
done
unless
it
was
said
and
done
by
john
gourlay
his
lack
of
understanding
made
his
affectation
of
contempt
the
easier
a
man
can
never
sneer
at
a
thing
which
he
really
understands
gourlay
understanding
nothing
was
able
to
sneer
at
everything
hah
i
do
understand
that
it
damned
nonsense
that
was
his
attitude
to
life
if
that
had
been
an
utterance
of
shakespeare
or
napoleon
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
john
gourlay
it
would
have
been
damned
nonsense
just
the
same
and
he
would
have
told
them
so
if
he
had
met
them
the
man
had
made
dogged
scorn
a
principle
of
life
to
maintain
himself
at
the
height
which
his
courage
warranted
his
thickness
of
wit
was
never
a
bar
to
the
success
of
his
irony
for
the
irony
of
the
ignorant
scot
is
rarely
the
outcome
of
intellectual
qualities
it
depends
on
a
falsetto
voice
and
the
use
of
a
recognized
number
of
catchwords
me
me
just
just
d
tell
me
that
wonderful
serr
wonderful
ah
well
these
be
words
of
potent
irony
when
uttered
with
a
certain
birr
long
practice
had
made
gourlay
an
adept
in
their
use
he
never
spoke
to
those
he
despised
or
disliked
without
the
birr
not
that
he
was
voluble
of
speech
he
was
clever
enough
for
lengthy
abuse
he
said
little
and
his
voice
was
low
but
every
word
from
the
hard
clean
lips
was
a
stab
and
often
his
silence
was
more
withering
than
any
utterance
it
struck
life
like
a
black
frost
in
those
early
days
to
be
sure
gourlay
had
less
occasion
for
the
use
of
his
crude
but
potent
irony
since
the
sense
of
his
material
warmed
him
and
made
him
less
bitter
to
the
world
to
the
substantial
farmers
and
petty
squires
around
he
was
civil
even
hearty
in
his
manner
unless
they
offended
him
for
they
belonged
to
the
close
corporation
of
bien
men
and
his
familiarity
with
them
was
a
proof
to
the
world
of
his
greatness
others
again
were
far
too
far
beneath
him
already
for
him
to
down
them
he
reserved
his
gibes
for
his
immediate
foes
the
assertive
bodies
his
rivals
in
the
town
and
for
his
wife
who
was
a
constant
eyesore
as
for
her
he
had
baited
the
poor
woman
so
long
that
it
had
become
a
habit
he
never
spoke
to
her
without
a
sneer
ay
where
have
been
stravaiging
to
he
would
drawl
and
if
she
answered
meekly
i
was
taking
a
dander
to
the
linn
the
linn
he
would
take
her
up
ye
had
a
heap
to
do
to
gang
there
your
bible
would
fit
you
better
on
a
bonny
sabbath
afternune
or
it
might
be
what
that
you
burying
your
nose
in
now
and
if
she
faltered
it
the
bible
hi
he
would
laugh
you
turning
godly
in
your
auld
age
weel
i
no
saying
but
it
time
where
janet
he
demanded
stamping
his
boots
once
more
now
he
had
them
laced
eh
said
his
wife
vaguely
turning
her
eyes
from
the
window
ye
not
turning
deaf
i
hope
i
was
asking
ye
where
janet
was
i
sent
her
down
to
scott
for
a
can
o
milk
she
answered
him
wearily
no
doubt
ye
had
to
send
said
he
what
ails
the
lamb
that
ye
couldna
send
eh
oh
she
was
about
when
i
wanted
the
milk
and
she
volunteered
to
gang
man
it
seems
i
never
do
a
thing
to
please
ye
what
harm
will
it
do
her
to
run
for
a
drop
milk
noan
he
said
gravely
noan
and
it
right
no
doubt
that
her
brother
should
still
be
abed
oh
it
right
that
he
should
get
the
privilege
seeing
he
the
eldest
gourlay
was
what
the
scotch
call
browdened
on
her
boy
in
spite
of
her
slack
grasp
on
life
perhaps
because
of
it
she
clung
with
a
tenacious
fondness
to
him
he
was
all
she
had
for
janet
was
a
thowless
thing
too
like
her
mother
for
her
mother
to
like
her
and
gourlay
had
discovered
that
it
was
one
way
of
getting
at
his
wife
to
be
hard
upon
the
thing
she
loved
in
his
desire
to
nag
and
annoy
her
he
adopted
a
manner
of
hardness
and
repression
to
his
son
which
became
permanent
he
was
always
down
on
john
the
more
so
because
janet
was
his
own
favourite
perhaps
again
because
her
mother
seemed
to
neglect
her
janet
was
a
very
unlovely
child
with
a
long
tallowy
face
and
a
pimply
brow
over
which
a
stiff
fringe
of
whitish
hair
came
down
almost
to
her
staring
eyes
the
eyes
themselves
being
large
pale
blue
and
with
a
great
margin
of
unhealthy
white
but
gourlay
though
he
never
petted
her
had
a
silent
satisfaction
in
his
daughter
he
took
her
about
with
him
in
the
gig
on
saturday
afternoons
when
he
went
to
buy
cheese
and
grain
at
the
outlying
farms
and
he
fed
her
rabbits
when
she
had
the
fever
it
was
a
curious
sight
to
see
the
dour
silent
man
mixing
oatmeal
and
wet
in
a
saucer
at
the
dirty
kitchen
table
and
then
marching
off
to
the
hutch
with
the
ridiculous
dish
in
his
hand
to
feed
his
daughter
pets
a
sudden
yell
of
pain
and
alarm
rang
through
the
kitchen
it
came
from
the
outer
yard
when
the
boy
peering
from
the
window
above
saw
his
father
disappear
through
the
scullery
door
he
stole
out
the
coast
was
clear
at
last
he
passed
through
to
the
outer
yard
jock
gilmour
had
been
dashing
water
on
the
paved
floor
and
was
now
sweeping
it
out
with
a
great
whalebone
besom
the
hissing
whalebone
sent
a
splatter
of
dirty
drops
showering
in
front
of
it
john
set
his
bare
feet
wide
he
was
only
in
his
shirt
and
knickers
and
eyed
the
man
whom
his
father
had
downed
with
a
kind
of
silent
swagger
he
felt
superior
his
pose
was
instinct
with
the
feeling
father
is
master
and
ye
daurna
stand
up
till
him
children
of
masterful
sires
often
display
that
attitude
towards
dependants
the
feeling
is
not
the
less
real
for
being
subconscious
jock
gilmour
was
still
seething
with
a
dour
anger
because
quiet
will
had
ground
him
to
the
task
when
john
came
out
and
stood
there
he
felt
tempted
to
vent
on
him
the
spite
he
felt
against
his
father
the
subtle
suggestion
of
criticism
and
superiority
in
the
pose
intensified
the
wish
not
that
gilmour
acted
from
deliberate
malice
his
irritation
was
instinctive
our
wrath
against
those
whom
we
fear
is
generally
wreaked
upon
those
whom
we
do
john
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
strutted
across
the
yard
still
watching
gilmour
with
that
silent
offensive
look
he
came
into
the
path
of
the
whalebone
get
out
you
smeowt
cried
gilmour
and
with
a
vicious
shove
of
the
brush
he
sent
a
shower
of
dirty
drops
spattering
about
the
boy
bare
legs
hallo
you
what
are
ye
after
bawled
the
boy
do
you
try
that
on
again
i
telling
ye
what
are
onyway
ye
just
a
servant
my
man
my
faither
the
boy
for
ye
can
put
ye
in
your
place
gilmour
made
to
go
at
him
with
the
head
of
the
whalebone
besom
john
stooped
and
picked
up
the
wet
lump
of
cloth
with
which
gilmour
had
been
washing
down
the
horse
legs
would
ye
said
gilmour
threateningly
would
i
no
said
john
the
wet
lump
poised
for
throwing
level
with
his
shoulder
but
he
did
not
throw
it
for
all
his
defiant
air
he
hesitated
he
would
have
liked
to
slash
it
into
gilmour
face
but
a
swift
vision
of
what
would
happen
if
he
did
withheld
his
craving
arm
his
irresolution
was
patent
in
his
face
in
his
eyes
there
were
both
a
threat
and
a
watchful
fear
he
kept
the
dirty
cloth
poised
in
drap
the
clout
said
gilmour
i
no
said
john
gilmour
turned
sideways
and
whizzed
the
head
of
the
besom
round
so
that
its
dirty
spray
rained
in
the
boy
face
and
eyes
john
let
him
have
the
wet
lump
slash
in
his
mouth
gilmour
dropped
the
besom
and
hit
him
a
sounding
thwack
on
the
ear
john
hullabalooed
murther
and
desperation
ere
he
had
gathered
breath
for
a
second
roar
his
mother
was
present
in
the
yard
she
was
passionate
in
defence
of
her
cub
and
rage
transformed
her
her
tense
frame
vibrated
in
anger
you
would
scarce
have
recognized
the
weary
trollop
of
the
kitchen
what
the
matter
johnny
dear
she
cried
with
a
fierce
glance
at
gilmour
gilmour
hut
me
he
bellowed
angrily
ye
muckle
lump
she
cried
shrilly
the
two
scraggy
muscles
of
her
neck
standing
out
long
and
thin
as
she
screamed
ye
muckle
lump
to
strike
a
defenceless
wean
dinna
greet
my
lamb
i
no
let
him
meddle
jock
gilmour
how
daur
ye
lift
your
finger
to

of
mine
but
i
learn

the
better
gourlay
gie
the
order
to
travel
ere
the
day
muckle
aulder
i
have
no
servant
about
hoose
to
bairn
she
stopped
panting
angrily
for
breath
and
glared
at
her
enemy
servant
cried
gilmour
in
contempt
ye
a
object
to
talk
about
servants
he
pointed
at
her
slovenly
dress
and
burst
into
a
blatant
laugh
huh
huh
huh
gourlay
had
followed
more
slowly
from
the
kitchen
as
befitted
a
man
of
his
superior
character
he
heard
the
row
well
enough
but
considered
it
beneath
him
to
hasten
to
a
petty
squabble
what
this
he
demanded
with
a
widening
look
gilmour
scowled
at
the
ground
this
shrilled
gourlay
who
had
recovered
her
breath
again
this
look
at
him
there
the
muckle
slabber
and
she
pointed
to
gilmour
who
was
standing
with
a
downcast
face
look
at
him
a
man
of
that
size
to
even
himsell
to
a
wean
he
deserved
a
he
got
said
gilmour
sullenly
his
mother
spoils
him
at
ony
rate
and
i
damned
if
the
best
gourlay
that
ever
dirtied
leather
gaun
to
trample
owre
gourlay
jumped
round
with
a
quick
start
of
the
whole
body
for
a
full
minute
he
held
gilmour
in
the
middle
of
his
steady
glower
walk
he
said
pointing
to
the
gate
oh
i
walk
bawled
gilmour
screaming
now
that
anger
gave
him
courage
gie
me
time
to
get
kist
and
i
walk
mighty
quick
and
damned
glad
i
be
to
get
redd
o
you
and
your
hoose
the
hoose
wi
the
green
shutters
he
laughed
hi
hi
hi
the
hoose
wi
the
green
shutters
gourlay
went
slowly
up
to
him
opening
his
eyes
on
him
black
and
wide
you
swine
he
said
with
quiet
vehemence
for
damned
little
i
would
kill
ye
wi
a
glower
gilmour
shrank
from
the
blaze
in
his
eyes
oh
dinna
be
said
gourlay
quietly
dinna
be
i
would
dirty
my
hand
on
but
get
your
bit
kist
and
i
see
ye
off
the
premises
suspeecious
characters
are
worth
the
watching
suspeecious
stuttered
gilmour
suspeecious
was
i
ever
suspeecious
i
have
the
law
of
ye
for
that
i
make
ye
answer
for
your
imphm
said
gourlay
in
the
meantime
look
slippy
wi
that
bit
box
yours
i
do
like
daft
folk
about
hoose
there
be
dafter
folk
as
me
in
your
hoose
yet
spluttered
gilmour
angrily
as
he
turned
away
he
went
up
to
the
garret
where
he
slept
and
brought
down
his
trunk
as
he
passed
through
the
scullery
bowed
beneath
the
clumsy
burden
on
his
left
shoulder
john
recovered
from
his
sobbing
mocked
at
him
he
said
in
throaty
derision
my
faither
the
boy
for
ye
yon
was
the
way
to
put
ye
down
footnotes
a
scot
devoted
to
his
children
is
said
to
be
browdened
on
his
bairns
weak
useless
chapter
in
every
little
scotch
community
there
is
a
distinct
type
known
as
the
bodie
what
does
he
do
that
man
you
may
ask
and
the
answer
will
be
really
i
could
hardly
tell
ye
what
he
does
he
juist
a
bodie
the
bodie
may
be
a
gentleman
of
independent
means
a
hundred
a
year
from
the
funds
fussing
about
in
spats
and
light
check
breeches
or
he
may
be
a
jobbing
gardener
but
he
is
equally
a
bodie
the
chief
occupation
of
his
idle
hours
and
his
hours
are
chiefly
idle
is
the
discussion
of
his
neighbour
affairs
he
is
generally
an
auld
residenter
great
therefore
at
the
redding
up
of
pedigrees
he
can
tell
you
exactly
for
instance
how
it
is
that
young
taking
geyly
to
the
dram
for
his
grandfather
it
seems
was
a
terrible
man
for
the
drink
ou
just
terrible
why
he
went
to
bed
with
a
full
jar
of
whisky
once
and
when
he
left
it
he
was
dead
and
it
was
empty
so
ye
see
that
the
reason
the
genus
bodie
is
divided
into
two
species
the
harmless
bodies
and
the
nesty
bodies
the
bodies
of
barbie
mostly
belonged
to
the
second
variety
johnny
coe
and
tam
wylie
and
the
baker
were
decent
enough
fellows
in
their
way
but
the
others
were
the
sons
of
scandal
gourlay
spoke
of
them
as
a
wheen
damned
auld
wives
but
gourlay
to
be
sure
was
not
an
impartial
witness
the
bend
o
the
brae
was
the
favourite
stance
of
the
bodies
here
they
forgathered
every
day
to
pass
judgment
on
the
town
affairs
and
indeed
the
place
had
many
things
to
recommend
it
among
the
chief
it
was
within
an
easy
distance
of
the
red
lion
farther
up
the
street
to
which
it
was
really
very
convenient
to
adjourn
nows
and
nans
standing
at
the
bend
o
the
brae
too
you
could
look
along
two
roads
to
the
left
and
right
or
down
upon
the
cross
beneath
and
the
three
low
streets
that
guttered
away
from
it
or
you
might
turn
and
look
up
main
street
and
past
the
side
of
the
square
to
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
the
highest
in
the
town
the
bend
o
the
brae
you
will
gather
was
a
fine
post
for
observation
it
had
one
drawback
true
if
gourlay
turned
to
the
right
in
his
gig
he
disappeared
in
a
moment
and
you
could
never
be
sure
where
he
was
off
to
but
even
that
afforded
matter
for
pleasing
speculation
which
often
lasted
half
an
hour
it
was
about
nine
when
gourlay
and
gilmour
quarrelled
in
the
yard
and
that
was
the
hour
when
the
bodies
forgathered
for
their
morning
dram
mr
wylie
said
the
provost
when
the
provost
wished
you
with
a
heavy
civic
eye
you
felt
sure
it
was
going
to
be
good
mornin
provost
mornin
fine
weather
for
the
fields
said
tam
casting
a
critical
glance
at
the
blue
dome
in
which
a
soft
cloud
floated
high
above
the
town
if
this
weather
hauds
it
be
a
blessing
for
us
poor
farming
bodies
tam
was
a
wealthy
old
hunks
but
it
suited
his
humour
to
refer
to
himself
constantly
as
a
poor
farming
bodie
and
he
dressed
in
accordance
with
his
humour
his
clean
old
face
was
always
grinning
at
you
from
over
a
moleskin
waistcoat
as
if
he
had
been
no
better
than
a
breaker
of
faith
ay
said
the
provost
cunning
and
quick
fodder
should
be
cheap
and
he
shot
the
covetous
glimmer
of
a
eye
at
wylie
tam
drew
himself
up
he
saw
what
was
coming
we
needing
some
hay
for
the
burgh
horse
said
the
provost
be
willing
to
sell
at
fifty
shillings
the
ton
since
it
like
to
be
so
plentiful
oh
said
tam
solemnly
that
gourlay
seeking
the
three
pound
and
where
he
leads
we
maun
a
gang
gourlay
sets
the
tune
and
barbie
dances
that
was
quite
untrue
so
far
as
the
speaker
was
concerned
it
took
a
clever
man
to
make
tam
wylie
dance
to
his
piping
but
thomas
the
knave
knew
that
he
could
always
take
a
rise
out
the
provost
by
cracking
up
the
gourlays
and
that
to
do
it
now
was
the
best
way
of
fobbing
him
off
about
the
hay
gourlay
muttered
the
provost
in
disgust
and
tam
winked
at
the
baker
losh
said
sandy
toddle
yonder
the
free

going
past

amid
the
massive
insolence
of
his
smooth

i
see
few
signs
of
studying
in

noathing

a
stink
wi
a
skin

brodie
was
a
very
important
man
look
you

wrote

mercht

his

sandy

had
kept
his
eye
on
the
minister
toddle
accent
was
a
varying
quality
when
he
remembered
he
had
been
a
packman
in
england
it
was
exceedingly
fine
but
he
often
forgot
the
skeighan

who

be
going
to
see
in
that
airt
will
it
be
templandmuir

he
was
there
no
later
than
yestreen
here
a
man
coming
down
the
brae
announced
johnny
coe
in
a
solemn
voice
as
if
a
man
coming
down
the
brae
was
something
unusual
in
a
moment
every
head
was
turned
to
the
hill
what
yon
he
carrying
on
his
shouther
pondered
brodie
it
looks
like
a
boax
said
the
provost
slowly
bending
every
effort
of
eye
and
mind
to
discover
what
it
really
was
he
was
giving
his
profoundest
cogitations
to
the
boax
it
a
boax
but
who
is
it
though
i
canna
make
him
out
dod
i
canna
tell
either
his
head
so
bent
with
his
burden
at
last
the
man
laying
his
boax
on
the
ground
stood
up
to
ease
his
spine
so
that
his
face
was
visible
losh

cried
johnny
coe
quickly
speaking
more
loudly
than
usual
in
the
animation
of

quarrelled

and
put

man

the
middle
of
the
road
the
provost
in
front
to
meet
gilmour
coming
down
ye
a
heavy
burden
this
morning
john
said
the
provost
graciously
no
wonder
sir
said
gilmour
with
solemnity
and
set
down
the
chest
it
no
wonder
seeing
that
i
carrying
my
ay
man
john
how
that
na
to
be
the
centre
of
interest
and
the
object
of
gracious
condescension
was
balm
to
the
wounded
feelings
of
gilmour
gourlay
had
lowered
him
but
this
reception
restored
him
to
his
own
good
opinion
he
was
usually
called
jock
except
by
his
mother
to
whom
of
course
he
was
oor
johnny
but
the
best
merchants
in
the
town
were
addressing
him
as
john
it
was
a
great
occasion
gilmour
expanded
in
gossip
beneath
its
influence
benign
he
welcomed
too
this
first
and
fine
opportunity
of
venting
his
wrath
on
the
gourlays
oh
i
just
telled
gourlay
what
i
thocht
of
him
and
took
the
door
ahint

i
let
him
have
it
hot
and
hardy
i
can
tell
ye
he
no
forget
in
a
hurry
gilmour
bawled
angrily
and
nodded
his
head
significantly
and
glared
fiercely
to
show
what
good
cause
he
had
given
gourlay
to
remember
him
he
no
forget
for
a
month
of
sundays
ay

pelt
of
questions
gilmour
answered
the
last
that
hit
his
ear
there
ay
faith
she
was
there
it
was
her
was
the
cause
d
tell
me

aye
swaggerin
aboot

he
follows
his
faither
example
in
that
for

auld
cock

the
young
ane
learns
and
his
mither
that
daft
aboot
him
that
ye
daurna
give
a
look
he
came
in
my
road
when
i
was
sweeping
out
the
close
and
some
o
the
dirty
jaups
splashed
about
his
shins
but
was
i
to
blame
for
that
ye
maun
walk
wide
o
a
whalebone
besom
if
ye
dinna
want
to
be
splashed
afore
i
kenned
where
i
was
he
up
wi
a
dirty
and
slashed
me
in
the
face
i
hit
him
a
thud
in
the
ear
as
wha
wadna
out
come
his
mither
like
a
fury
skirling
about
hoose
and
servants
and
weans
servant
says

aboot
servants
says
i
did
ye
really
john
man
that
wath
bauld
o
ye
and
what
did
say
oh
she
just
kept
skirling
and
then
to
be
sure
gourlay
must
come
out
and
interfere
but
i
telled
him
to
his
face
what
i
thocht
of
best
gourlay
that
ever
dirtied
leather
says
i
no
gaun
to
make
dirt
of
me
says
i
ay
man
dyohn
lisped
deacon
allardyce
with
bright
and
eagerly
inquiring
eyes
and
what
did
he
thay
to
that
na
wath
a
dig
for
him
warrant
he
wath
angry
angry
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
but
i
up
and
says
to
him
have
had
enough
o
you
says
i
and
your
hoose
wi
the
green
shutters
says
i
no
fit
to
have
a
decent
servant
says
i
wages
and
i
be
redd
o
ye
says
i
and
wi
that
i
flang
my
kist
on
my
shouther
and
slapped
the
gate
ahint
me
and
he
pay
ye
your
wages
tam
wylie
probed
him
slyly
with
a
sideward
glimmer
in
his
eye
ah
well
no
not
exactly
said
gilmour
drawing
in
but
i
get
them
right
enough
for
a
that
he
no
get
the
better
o
having
grounded
unpleasantly
on
the
question
of
the
wages
he
thought
it
best
to
be
off
ere
the
bloom
was
dashed
from
his
importance
so
he
shouldered
his
chest
and
went
the
bodies
watched
him
down
the
street
he
a
lying
brose
that
said
the
baker
we
a
ken
what
gourlay
is
he
would
have
flung
gilmour
out
by
the
scruff
o
the
neck
if
he
had
daured
to
set
his
tongue
against
him
faith
that
so
said
tam
wylie
and
johnny
coe
together
but
the
others
were
divided
between
their
perception
of
the
fact
and
their
wish
to
believe
that
gourlay
had
received
a
thrust
or
two
at
other
times
they
would
have
been
the
first
to
scoff
at
swagger
now
their
animus
against
gourlay
prompted
them
to
back
it
up
oh
i
not
so
sure
of
baker
cried
the
provost
in
the
false
loud
voice
of
a
man
defending
a
position
which
he
knows
to
be
unsound
i
no
so
sure
of
that
at
mind
ye
he
drawled
persuasively
he
a
hardy
fallow
that
gilmour
i
no
doubt
he
gied
gourlay
a
good
dig
or
two
let
us
howp
they
will
do
him
good
for
many
reasons
intimate
to
the
scot
character
envious
scandal
is
rampant
in
petty
towns
such
as
barbie
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
the
scot
as
pundits
will
tell
you
is
an
individualist
his
religion
alone
is
enough
to
make
him
so
for
it
is
a
scheme
of
personal
salvation
significantly
described
once
by
the
reverend
struthers
of
barbie
at
the
day
of
judgment
my
frehnds
said
struthers
at
the
day
of
judgment
every
herring
must
hang
by
his
own
tail
was
never
more
luridly
expressed
history
climate
social
conditions
and
the
national
beverage
have
all
combined
the
pundits
go
on
to
make
the
scot
an
individualist
fighting
for
his
own
hand
the
better
for
him
if
it
be
so
from
that
he
gets
the
grit
that
tells
from
their
individualism
however
comes
inevitably
a
keen
spirit
of
competition
the
more
so
because
scotch
democracy
gives
fine
chances
to
compete
and
from
their
keen
spirit
of
competition
comes
inevitably
again
an
envious
belittlement
of
rivals
if
a
man
success
offends
your
individuality
to
say
everything
you
can
against
him
is
a
recognized
weapon
of
the
fight
it
takes
him
down
a
bit
and
inversely
elevates
his
rival
it
is
in
a
small
place
like
barbie
that
such
malignity
is
most
virulent
because
in
a
small
place
like
barbie
every
man
knows
everything
to
his
neighbour
detriment
he
can
redd
up
his
rival
pedigree
for
example
and
lower
his
pride
if
need
be
by
detailing
the
disgraces
of
his
kin
i
have
grand
news
the
day
a
scot
will
exclaim
and
when
their
hearts
are
big
they
are
big
to
hypertrophy
i
have
grand
news
the
day
man
jock
goudie
has
won
the
jock
goudie
an
envious
bodie
will
pucker
as
if
he
had
never
heard
the
name
jock
goudie
for
a
goudie
oh
ay
let
me
see
now
he
a
brother
o
eh
a
brother
o
eh
on
his
brow
oh
just
a
brother
drucken
will
goudie
o
auchterwheeze
i
ken
fine
his
grannie
keepit
a
in
strathbungo
there
you
have
the
nesty
scotsman
even
if
gourlay
had
been
a
placable
and
inoffensive
man
then
the
malignants
of
the
petty
burgh
it
was
scarce
bigger
than
a
village
would
have
fastened
on
his
character
simply
because
he
was
above
them
no
man
has
a
keener
eye
for
behaviour
than
the
scot
especially
when
spite
wings
his
intuition
and
gourlay
thickness
of
wit
and
pride
of
place
would
in
any
case
have
drawn
their
sneers
so
too
on
lower
grounds
would
his
wife
sluttishness
but
his
repressiveness
added
a
hundredfold
to
their
hate
of
him
that
was
the
particular
cause
which
acting
on
their
general
tendency
to
belittle
a
rival
made
their
spite
almost
monstrous
against
him
not
a
man
among
them
but
had
felt
the
weight
of
his
tongue
for
edge
it
had
none
he
walked
among
them
like
the
dirt
below
his
feet
there
was
no
give
and
take
in
the
man
he
could
be
verra
jocose
with
the
lairds
to
be
sure
but
he
never
dropped
in
to
the
red
lion
for
a
crack
and
a
dram
with
the
he
just
glowered
as
if
he
could
devour
them
and
who
was
he
i
should
like
to
know
his
grandfather
had
been
noathing
but
a
common
carrier
hate
was
the
greater
on
both
sides
because
it
was
often
impotent
gourlay
frequently
suspected
offence
and
seethed
because
he
had
no
idea
how
to
meet
it
except
by
driving
slowly
down
the
brae
in
his
new
gig
and
never
letting
on
when
the
provost
called
to
him
that
was
a
wipe
in
the
eye
for
the
provost
the
bodies
on
their
part
could
rarely
get
near
enough
gourlay
to
pierce
his
armour
he
kept
them
off
him
by
his
brutal
dourness
for
it
was
not
only
pride
and
arrogance
but
a
consciousness
also
that
he
was
no
match
for
them
at
their
own
game
that
kept
gourlay
away
from
their
society
they
were
adepts
at
the
under
stroke
and
they
would
have
given
him
many
a
dig
if
he
had
only
come
amongst
them
but
oh
no
not
he
he
was
the
big
man
he
never
gave
a
body
a
chance
or
if
you
did
venture
a
bit
jibe
when
you
met
him
he
glowered
you
off
the
face
of
the
earth
with
thae
black
een
of
his
oh
how
they
longed
to
get
at
him
it
was
not
the
least
of
the
evils
caused
by
gourlay
black
pride
that
it
perverted
a
dozen
characters
the
bodies
of
barbie
may
have
been
decent
enough
men
in
their
own
way
but
against
him
their
malevolence
was
monstrous
it
showed
itself
in
an
insane
desire
to
seize
on
every
scrap
of
gossip
they
might
twist
against
him
that
was
why
the
provost
lowered
municipal
dignity
to
gossip
in
the
street
with
a
discharged
servant
as
the
baker
said
afterwards
it
was
absurd
for
a
man
in
his
poseetion
but
it
was
done
with
the
sole
desire
of
hearing
something
that
might
tell
against
gourlay
even
countesses
we
are
told
gossip
with
malicious
maids
about
other
countesses
spite
is
a
great
leveller
shall
we
adjourn
said
brodie
when
they
had
watched
jock
gilmour
out
of
sight
he
pointed
across
his
shoulder
to
the
red
lion
better
noat
just
now
said
the
provost
nodding
in
slow
authority
better
noat
just
now
i
very
anxious
to
see
gourlay
about
yon
matter
we
were
speaking
of
doa
ye
but
determined
not
to
go
to
his
house
on
the
other
hand
if
we
go
into
the
red
lion
the
now
we
may
miss
him
on
the
street
we
noat
have
loang
to
wait
though
he
be
down
the
town
directly
to
look
at
the
horses
he
has
at
the
gerse
out
the
fechars
road
but
talling
ye
i
simply
will
noat
go
to
his
house
to
put
up
with
a
wheen
damned
insults
he
puffed
in
angry
recollection
to
tell
the
truth
said
wylie
i
do
like
to
call
upon
gourlay
either
i
aware
of
his
eyes
on
my
back
when
i
slink
beaten
through
his
gate
and
i
feel
that
my
hurdies
are
wanting
in
dignity
huh
spluttered
brodie
that
never
affects
me
i
come
stunting
out
in
a
bleeze
of
wrath
and
slam
the
yett
ahint
me
oh
well
said
the
deacon
one
way
of
being
dignified
i
afraid
said
sandy
toddle
that
he
wo
be
in
a
very
good
key
to
consider
our
request
this
morning
after
his
quarrel
with
gilmour
no
said
the
provost
he
be
blazing
angry
it
most
unfoartunate
but
we
maun
try
to
get
his
consent
be
his
temper
what
it
will
it
a
matter
of
importance
to
the
town
doa
ye
see
and
if
he
refuses
we
simply
proceed
wi
the
improvement
it
was
gilmour
jibe
at
the
house
wi
the
green
shutters
that
would
anger
him
the
most
for
it
the
perfect
god
of
his
idolatry
eh
sirs
he
has
wasted
an
awful
money
upon
yon
house
wasted
the
word
said
brodie
with
a
blatant
laugh
wasted
the
word
they
say
he
has
verra
little
lying
cash
and
i
shouldna
be
surprised
at
all
for
ye
see
gibson
the
builder
diddled
him
owre
the
building
oh
warrant
cunning
johnny
would
get
the
better
of
an
ass
like
gourlay
but
how
in
particular
brodie
have
ye
heard
ainy
details
i
been
on
the
track
o
the
thing
for
a
while
back
but
it
was
only
yestreen
i
had
the
proofs
it
was
robin
wabster
that
telled
me
a
jouking
bodie
robin
and
he
was
ahint
a
dike
up
the
skeighan
road
when
gibson
and
gourlay
forgathered
they
stoppit
just
forenenst
him
gourlay
began
to
curse
at
the
size
of
gibson
bill
but
cunning
johnny
kenned
the
way
to
get
round
him
brawly
gourlay
says
he
not
a
thing
in
your
house
that
a
man
in
your
poseetion
can
afford
to
be
without
and
ye
need
expect
the
best
house
in
barbie
for
an
oald
song
and
gourlay
was
pacified
at
once
it
appeared
frae
their
crack
however
that
gibson
has
diddled
him
tremendous
well
then
robin
heard
gourlay
cry
must
allow
me
a
while
ere
i
pay
that
i
wager
for
a
sae
muckle
as
he
made
of
late
that
his
balance
at
the
bank
a
sma
yin
more
thyow
than
thubstanth
said
the
deacon
well
i
sure
said
the
provost
he
need
have
built
such
a
house
to
put
a
slut
of
a
wife
like
yon
in
i
was
surprised
said
sandy
toddle
to
hear
about
her
firing
up
i
would
have
thought
she
had
the
spirit
or
that
gourlay
would
have
come
to
her
support
oh
said
the
provost
it
was
her
he
was
thinking
of
it
was
his
own
pride
the
brute
he
leads
the
woman
the
life
of
a
doag
surprised
that
he
ever
married
her
i
ken
fine
how
he
married
her
said
johnny
coe
i
was
acquaint
her
faither
auld
tenshillingland
owre

a
grand
farmer
he
was
wi
land
o
his
nain
and
a
gey
pickle
bawbees
it
was
the
bawbees
and
not
the
woman
that
gourlay
went
after
it
was
money
as
ye
ken
that
set
him
on
his
feet
and
made
him
such
a
big
man
he
never
cared
a
preen
for
and
then
when
she
proved
a
dirty
trollop
he
couldna
endure
her
look
that
what
makes
him
so
sore
upon
her
now
and
yet
i
mind
her

braw
lass

said
johnny
the
sentimentalist
a
braw
lass
she
was
he
mused
wi
fine
brown
glossy
hair
i
mind
and
ochonee
ochonee
as
daft
as
a
yett
in
a
windy
day
she

a
cousin
jenny
wabster
that
dwelt
in
tenshillingland
than
and
mony
a
summer
nicht
up
the
fechars
road
when
ye
smelled
the
honeysuckle
in
the
gloaming
i
have
heard
the
two
o
them
owre
the
lads
thegither
skirling
in
the
dark
and
lauching
to
themselves
they
were
of
the
glaikit
kind
ye
can
always
hear
loang
before
ye
see
jock
allan
that

done
so
well
in
embro

a
herd
at
tenshillingland
than
and
he
likit

but
gourlay
came
wi
his
gig
and
whisked
her
away
she
doesna
lauch
sae
muckle
now
puir
bodie
but
a
braw
lass
she
it
you
maun
speak
to
gourlay
deacon
said
the
provost
brushing
aside
the
reminiscent
coe
how
can
it
be
that
provost
place
surely
you
the
head
of
the
town
when
gourlay
was
to
be
approached
there
was
always
a
competition
for
who
should
be
hindmost
yass
but
you
know
perfectly
well
deacon
that
i
can
not
thole
the
look
of
him
i
simply
can
not
thole
the
look
and
he
knows
it
too
the
thing
gang
smash
at
the
outset
talling
ye
now
it
go
smash
at
the
outset
if
it
left
to
me
and
than
ye
see
you
have
a
better
way
of
approaching
folk
ith
that
tho
said
the
deacon
dryly
he
shot
a
suspicious
glance
to
see
if
the
provost
was
guying
him
oh
it
must
be
left
to
you
deacon
said
the
baker
and
tam
wylie
in
a
breath
certainly
it
maun
be
left
to
the
deacon
assented
johnny
coe
when
he
saw
how
the
others
were
giving
their
opinion
tho
be
it
then
snapped
the
deacon
here
he
comes
said
sandy
toddle
gourlay
came
down
the
street
towards
them
his
chest
big
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
he
had
the
power
of
staring
steadily
at
those
whom
he
approached
without
the
slightest
sign
of
recognition
or
intelligence
appearing
in
his
eyes
as
he
marched
down
upon
the
bodies
he
fixed
them
with
a
glower
that
was
devoid
of
every
expression
but
courageous
steadiness
it
gave
a
kind
of
fierce
vacancy
to
his
look
the
deacon
limped
forward
on
his
thin
shanks
to
the
middle
of
the
road
a
fine
morning
gourlay
he
simpered
there
noathing
wrong
with
the
morning
grunted
gourlay
as
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
deacon
we
wath
wanting
to
thee
ye
on
a
very
important
matter
mithter
gourlay
lisped
the
deacon
smiling
up
at
the
big
man
face
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
rubbing
his
fingers
in
front
of
him
a
matter
of
the
common
good
you
thee
and
we
all
agreed
that
we
should
speak
to
ath
the
foremost
merchant
of
the
town
allardyce
meant
his
compliment
to
fetch
gourlay
but
gourlay
knew
his
allardyce
and
was
cautious
it
was
well
to
be
on
your
guard
when
the
deacon
was
complimentary
when
his
language
was
most
flowery
there
was
sure
to
be
a
serpent
hidden
in
it
somewhere
he
would
lisp
out
an
innocent
remark
and
toddle
away
and
gourlay
would
think
nothing
of
the
matter
till
a
week
afterwards
perhaps
when
something
would
flash
a
light
then
damn
him
did
he
mean
he
would
seethe
starting
back
and
staring
at
the
while
his
fingers
strangled
the
air
in
place
of
the
deacon
he
glowered
at
the
deacon
now
till
the
deacon
blinked
you
thee
gourlay
allardyce
shuffled
uneasily
for
your
own
benefit
just
ath
much
ath
ourth
we
were
thinking
of
you
ath
well
ath
of
ourthelves
oh
yeth
oh
yeth
ay
man
said
gourlay
that
was
kind
of
ye
i
be
the
first
man
in
barbie
to
get
ainy
benefit
from
the
fools
that
mismanage
our
affairs
the
gravel
grated
beneath
the
provost
foot
the
atmosphere
was
becoming
electric
and
the
deacon
hastened
to
the
point
you
thee
a
fine
natural
supply
of
water
a
perfect
reservore
the
provost
sayth
on
the
just
above
garden
gourlay
now
it
would
be
easy
to
lead
that
water
down
and
alang
through
all
the
gardenth
on
the
high
side
of
main
street
and
it
might
feed
a
pump
at
the
cross
too
to
supply
the
lower
portionth
o
the
town
it
would
really
be
a
convenience
every
man
on
the
high
side
o
main
street
would
have
a
running
spout
at
his
own
back
door
if
your
garden
didna
run
tho
far
back
gourlay
and
ye
hadna
tho
muckle
land
about
your
place
should
fetch
him
thought
the
deacon
if
it
werena
for
that
gourlay
we
could
easily
lead
the
water
round
to
the
other
gardenth
without
interfering
with
your
property
but
ath
it
ith
we
simply
move
without
ye
the
water
must
come
through
your
garden
if
it
comes
at
the
most
o
you
important
men
live
on
the
high
side
o
main
street
birred
gourlay
is
it
the
poor
folk
at
the
cross
or
your
ain
bits
back
doors
that
you
thinking
o
oh
oh
mr
gourlay
protested
allardyce
head
flung
back
and
palms
in
air
to
keep
the
thought
of
away
oh
oh
gourlay
we
thinking
of
noathing
but
the
common
good
i
do
assure
ye
ay
man
you
said
gourlay
but
he
stumbled
on
the
big
word
and
spoiled
the
sneer
that
angered
him
and
it
likely
he
rapped
out
that
i
allow
the
land
round
house
to
be
howked
and
trenched
and
made
a
mudhole
of
to
oblige
a
wheen
things
like
you
oh
oh
but
think
of
the
convenience
to
uth

allardyce
i
howked
wells
for
myself
snapped
gourlay
let
others
do
the
like
oh

gourlay
in
silence
until
he
was
out
of
earshot
then
it

the
provost
broke
out
in
solemn
anger
i
declare
perfectly
monstrous

provost
was
fond
of
talking
about
because
it
implied
that
he
was
intimate
with
the
great
authorities
who
might
delegate
such
to
him
to
talk
of
mysteriously
was
a
tribute
to
his
own
importance
he
rolled
the
word
on
his
tongue
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
sound
of
it
on
the
deacon
cheek
bones
two
red
spots
flamed
round
and
big
as
a
scotch
penny
his
was
the
hurt
silence
of
the
baffled
diplomatist
to
whom
a
defeat
means
reflections
on
his
own
ability
demn
him
he
skirled
following
the
solid
march
of
his
enemy
with
fiery
eyes
never
before
had
his
deaconship
been
heard
to
swear
tam
wylie
laughed
at
the
shrill
oath
till
his
eyes
were
buried
in
his
merry
wrinkles
a
suppressed
snirt
a
continuous
gurgle
in
the
throat
and
nose
in
beaming
survey
the
while
of
the
withered
old
creature
dancing
in
his
rage
it
was
all
a
good
joke
to
tam
because
living
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
had
no
spigot
of
his
own
to
feed
the
deacon
turned
the
eyes
of
hate
on
him
demn
wylie
too
what
was
he
laughing
at
oh
i
dare
thay
you
could
have
got
round
him
he
snapped
in
my
opinion
allardyce
said
the
baker
you
mismanaged
the
whole
affair
yon
wasna
the
way
to
approach
him
a
pity
you
didna
try
your
hand
then
i
sure
no
doubt
a
clever
man
like
would
have
worked
wonderth
so
the
bodies
wrangled
among
themselves
somehow
or
other
gourlay
had
the
knack
of
setting
them
by
the
ears
it
was
not
till
they
hit
on
a
common
topic
of
their
spite
in
railing
at
him
that
they
became
a
band
of
brothers
and
a
happy
few
whisht
said
sandy
toddle
suddenly
here
his
boy
john
was
coming
towards
them
on
his
way
to
school
the
bodies
watched
him
as
he
passed
with
the
fixed
look
men
turn
on
a
boy
of
whose
kinsmen
they
were
talking
even
now
they
affect
a
stony
and
deliberate
regard
partly
to
include
the
newcomer
in
their
critical
survey
of
his
family
and
partly
to
banish
from
their
own
eyes
any
sign
that
they
have
just
been
running
down
his
people
john
as
quick
as
his
mother
to
feel
knew
in
a
moment
they
were
watching
he
hung
his
head
sheepishly
and
blushed
and
the
moment
he
was
past
he
broke
into
a
nervous
trot
the
bag
of
books
bumping
on
his
back
as
he
ran
he
getting
a
big
boy
that
son
of
gourlay
said
the
provost
how
oald
will
he
be
he
approaching
twelve
said
johnny
coe
who
made
a
point
of
being
able
to
supply
such
news
because
it
gained
him
consideration
where
he
was
otherwise
unheeded
he
was
born
the
day
the
brig
on
the
fleckie
road
gaed
down
in
the
year
o
the
great
flood
and
since
the
great
flood
it
twelve
year
come
lammas
rab
tosh
o
fleckie
wife
was
at
the
time
and
doctor
munn
had
been
a
nicht
wi
her
and
when
he
cam
to
barbie
water
in
the
morning
it
was
roaring
wide
frae
bank
to
brae
where
the
brig
should
have
been
there
was
naething
but
the
swashing
of
the
yellow
waves
munn
had
to
drive
a
the
way
round
to
the
fechars
brig
and
in
parts
o
the
road
the
water
was
so
deep
that
it
lapped
his
horse
bellyband
a
this
time
gourlay
was
skirling
in
her
pains
and
praying
to
god
she
micht
dee
gourlay
had
been
a
great
crony
o
munn
but
he
quarrelled
him
for
being
late
he
had
trysted
him
ye
see
for
the
occasion
and
he
had
been
twenty
times
at
the
yett
to
look
for
him
ye
ken
how
little
he
would
stomach
that
he
was
ready
to
brust
wi
anger
munn
mad
for
the
want
of
sleep
and
wat
to
the
bane
swüre
back
at
him
and
than
gourlay
wadna
let
him
near
his
wife
ye
mind
what
an
awful
day
it
was
the
thunder
roared
as
if
the
heavens
were
tumbling
on
the
world
and
the
lichtnin
sent
the
trees
daudin
on
the
roads
and
folk
hid
below
their
beds
and
prayed
they
thocht
it
was
the
judgment
but
gourlay
rammed
his
black
stepper
in
the
shafts
and
drave
like
the
devil
o
hell
to
skeighan
drone
where
there
was
a
young
doctor
the
lad
was
feared
to
come
but
gourlay
swore
by
god
that
he
should
and
he
garred
him
in
a
the
countryside
driving
like
his
that
day
was
never
kenned
or
heard
tell
o
they
were
back
within
the
hour
i
saw
them
gallop
up
main
street
lichtnin
struck
the
ground
before
them
the
young
doctor
covered
his
face
wi
his
hands
and
the
horse
nichered
wi
fear
and
tried
to
wheel
but
gourlay
stood
up
in
the
gig
and
lashed
him
on
through
the
fire
it
was
thocht
for
lang
that
gourlay
would
die
and
she
was
never
the
same
woman
after
atweel
ay
sirs
gourlay
has
that
morning
work
to
blame
for
the
poor
wife
he
has
now
him
and
munn
never
spoke
to
each
other
again
and
munn
died
within
the
twelvemonth
he
got
his
death
that
morning
on
the
fleckie
road
but
for
a
so
pack
they
had
been
gourlay
never
looked
near
him
coe
had
told
his
story
with
enjoying
gusto
and
had
told
it
well
for
johnny
though
constantly
snubbed
by
his
fellows
was
in
many
ways
the
ablest
of
them
all
his
voice
and
manner
drove
it
home
they
knew
besides
he
was
telling
what
himself
had
seen
for
they
knew
he
was
lying
prostrate
with
fear
in
the
open
from
the
time
gourlay
went
to
skeighan
drone
to
the
time
that
he
came
back
and
that
he
had
seen
him
both
come
and
go
they
were
silent
for
a
while
impressed
in
spite
of
themselves
by
the
vivid
presentment
of
gourlay
manhood
on
the
day
that
had
scared
them
all
the
baker
felt
inclined
to
cry
out
on
his
cruelty
for
keeping
his
wife
suffering
to
gratify
his
wrath
but
the
sudden
picture
of
the
man
courage
changed
that
feeling
to
another
of
admiring
awe
a
man
so
defiant
of
the
angry
heavens
might
do
anything
and
so
with
the
others
they
hated
gourlay
but
his
bravery
was
a
fact
of
nature
which
they
could
not
disregard
they
knew
themselves
smaller
and
said
nothing
for
a
while
tam
brodie
the
most
brutal
among
them
was
the
first
to
recover
even
he
did
not
try
to
belittle
at
once
but
he
felt
the
subtle
discomfort
of
the
situation
and
relieved
it
by
bringing
the
conversation
back
to
its
usual
channel
that
was
at
the
boy
birth

that

gourlay
be
going
to
make
of
him
the

asked
a
doctor
or
a
minister
or
deil
a
fear
of
that

take
him
into
the

numbskull

could

from

son

gourlay
said
the
provost
conversation
languished
some
fillip
was
needed
to
bring
it
to
an
easy
flow
and
the
simultaneous
scrape
of
their
feet
turning
round
showed
the
direction
of
their
thoughts

john
gourlay
the
younger
was
late
for
school
in
spite
of
the
nervous
trot
he
fell
into
when
he
shrank
from
the
bodies
hard
stare
at
him
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
that
he
was
late
for
school
every
other
day
to
him
it
was
a
howling
wilderness
where
he
played
a
most
appropriate
if
his
father
was
not
about
he
would
hang
round
his
mother
till
the
last
moment
rather
than
be
off
to
old
as
the
master
had
been
christened
by
his
scholars
mother
i
have
a
pain
in
heid
he
would
whimper
and
she
would
condole
with
him
and
tell
him
she
would
keep
him
at
home
with
her
were
it
not
for
dread
of
her
husband
she
was
quite
sure
he
was
ainything
but
strong
poor
boy
and
that
the
schooling
was
bad
for
him
for
it
was
really
remarkable
how
quickly
the
pain
went
if
he
was
allowed
to
stay
at
home
why
he
got
better
just
directly
it
was
not
often
she
dared
to
keep
him
from
school
however
and
if
she
did
she
had
to
hide
him
from
his
father
on
school
mornings
the
boy
shrank
from
going
out
with
a
shrinking
that
was
almost
physical
when
he
stole
through
the
green
gate
with
his
bag
slithering
at
his
hip
not
braced
between
the
shoulders
like
a
birkie
scholar
he
used
to
feel
ruefully
that
he
was
in
for
it
now
and
the
lord
alone
knew
what
he
would
have
to
put
up
with
ere
he
came
home
and
he
always
had
the
feeling
of
a
freed
slave
when
he
passed
the
gate
on
his
return
never
failing
to
note
with
delight
the
clean
smell
of
the
yard
after
the
stuffiness
of
school
sucking
it
in
through
glad
nostrils
and
thinking
to
himself
o
crickey
it
fine
to
be
home
on
friday
nights
in
particular
he
used
to
feel
so
happy
that
becoming
arrogant
he
would
try
his
hand
at
bullying
jock
gilmour
in
imitation
of
his
father
john
dislike
of
school
and
fear
of
its
trampling
bravoes
attached
him
peculiarly
to
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
there
was
his
doting
mother
and
she
gave
him
stories
to
read
and
the
place
was
so
big
that
it
was
easy
to
avoid
his
father
and
have
great
times
with
the
rabbits
and
the
doos
he
was
as
proud
of
the
sonsy
house
as
gourlay
himself
if
for
a
different
reason
and
he
used
to
boast
of
it
to
his
comrades
and
he
never
left
it
then
or
after
without
a
foreboding
as
he
crept
along
the
school
road
with
a
rueful
face
he
was
alone
for
janet
who
was
cleverer
than
he
was
always
earlier
at
school
the
absence
of
children
in
the
sunny
street
lent
to
his
depression
he
felt
forlorn
if
there
had
been
a
chattering
crowd
marching
along
he
would
have
been
much
more
at
his
ease
quite
recently
the
school
had
been
fitted
up
with
varnished
desks
and
john
who
inherited
his
mother
nervous
senses
with
his
father
lack
of
wit
was
always
intensely
alive
to
the
smell
of
the
desks
the
moment
he
went
in
and
as
his
heart
always
sank
when
he
went
in
the
smell
became
associated
in
his
mind
with
that
sinking
of
the
heart
to
feel
it
no
matter
where
filled
him
with
uneasiness
as
he
stole
past
the
joiner
on
that
sunny
morning
when
wood
was
resinous
and
pungent
of
odour
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
varnishy
smell
and
felt
a
misgiving
without
knowing
why
it
was
years
after
in
edinburgh
ere
he
knew
the
reason
he
found
that
he
never
went
past
an
upholsterer
shop
on
a
hot
day
in
spring
without
being
conscious
of
a
vague
depression
and
feeling
like
a
boy
slinking
into
school
in
spite
of
his
forebodings
nothing
more
untoward
befell
him
that
morning
than
a
cut
over
the
cowering
shoulders
for
being
late
as
he
crept
to
the
bottom
of
his
class
he
reached
leave
the
ten
run
at
twelve
without
misadventure
perhaps
it
was
this
unwonted
good
fortune
that
made
him
boastful
when
he
crouched
near
the
pump
among
his
cronies
sitting
on
his
hunkers
with
his
back
to
the
wall
half
a
dozen
boys
were
about
him
and
swipey
broon
was
in
front
making
mud
pellets
in
a
trickle
from
the
pump
he
began
talking
of
the
new
range
yah
auld
gemmell
need
have
let
welp
at
me
for
being
late
this
morning
he
spluttered
nodding
his
head
in
aggrieved
and
solemn
protest
it
wasna
faut
we
getting
in
a
grand
new
range
and
the
whole
of
the
kitchen
fireplace
has
been
gutted
out
to
make
room
and
my
mother
couldna
get
my
breakfast
in
time
this
morning
because
ye
see
she
had
to
boil
everything
in
the
parlour
and
here
when
she
gaed
ben
the
house
the
parlour
fire
was
out
it
to
be
a
splendid
range
the
new
one
he
went
on
with
a
conceited
jerk
of
the
head
peter
riney
bringin
from
skeighan
in
the
afternune
my
father
says
there
winna
be
its
equal
in
the
parish
the
faces
of
the
boys
lowered
uncomfortably
they
felt
it
was
a
silly
thing
of
gourlay
to
blow
his
own
trumpet
in
this
way
but
being
boys
they
could
not
prick
his
conceit
with
a
quick
rejoinder
it
is
only
who
can
be
ironical
physical
violence
is
the
boy
repartee
it
had
scarcely
gone
far
enough
for
that
yet
so
they
lowered
in
uncomfortable
silence
we
aye
getting
new
things
up
at
our
place
he
went
on
i
heard
my
father
telling
gibson
the
builder
he
must
have
everything
of
the
best
mother
says
it
all
be
mine
some
day
i
have
the
fine
times
when
i
leave
the
schule
and
that
winna
be
long
now
for

a
day
longer
than
i
need

to
go
into
the
business
and
then
i
have
the
times

dash
about
the
country
in
a
gig
wi
two
dogs
wallopping
ahin
i
have
the
great
life
said
swipey
broon
and
planted
a
gob
of
mud
right
in
the
middle
of
his
brow
hoh
hoh
hoh
yelled
the
others
they
hailed
swipey
action
with
delight
because
to
their
minds
it
exactly
met
the
case
it
was
the
one
fit
retort
to
his
bouncing
beneath
the
wet
plunk
of
the
mud
john
started
back
bumping
his
head
against
the
wall
behind
him
the
sticky
pellet
clung
to
his
brow
and
he
brushed
it
angrily
aside
the
laughter
of
the
others
added
to
his
wrath
against
swipey
what
are
you
after
he
bawled
do
try
your
tricks
on
me
swipey
broon
man
i
could
kill
ye
wi
a
glower
in
a
twinkling
swipey
jacket
was
off
and
he
was
dancing
in
his
shirt
sleeves
inviting
gourlay
to
come
on
and
man
said
john
his
face
as
white
as
the
wall
man
do
have
getting
up
to
ye
or
i
knock
the
fleas
out
of
your
duds
now
the
father
of
swipey
so
called
because
he
always
swiped
when
batting
at
rounders
the
father
of
swipey
was
the
rag
and
bone
merchant
of
barbie
and
it
was
said
with
what
degree
of
truth
i
know
not
that
his
home
was
verminous
in
consequence
john
taunt
was
calculated
therefore
to
sting
him
to
the
quick
the
scion
of
the
broons
fired
for
the
honour
of
his
house
drove
straight
at
the
mouth
of
the
insulter
but
john
jouked
to
the
side
and
swipey
skinned
his
knuckles
on
the
wall
for
a
moment
he
rocked
to
and
fro
doubled
up
in
pain
crying
with
a
rueful
face
and
squeezing
his
hand
between
his
thighs
to
dull
its
sharper
agonies
then
with
redoubled
wrath
bold
swipey
hurled
him
at
the
foe
he
grabbed
gourlay
head
and
shoving
it
down
between
his
knees
proceeded
to
pommel
his
bent
back
while
john
bellowed
angrily
from
between
swipey
legs
let
me
up
see
swipey
let
him
up
john
came
at
him
with
whirling
arms
but
swipey
jouked
and
gave
him
one
on
the
mouth
that
split
his
lip
in
another
moment
gourlay
was
grovelling
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
triumphant
swipey
astride
his
back
was
bellowing
hurroo
swipey
father
was
an
irishman
let
him
up
broon
cried
peter
wylie
let
him
up
and
meet
each
other
square
oh
i
let
him
up
cried
swipey
and
leapt
to
his
feet
with
magnificent
pride
he
danced
round
gourlay
with
his
fists
sawing
the
air
i
could
fight
ten
of
him
come
on
gourlay
he
cried
and
poultice
the
road
wi
your
brose
john
rose
glaring
but
when
swipey
rushed
he
turned
and
fled
the
boys
ran
into
the
middle
of
the
street
pointing
after
the
coward
and
shouting
yeh
yeh
yeh
with
the
infinite
cruel
derision
of
boyhood
yeh
yeh
yeh
the
cries
of
execration
and
contempt
pursued
him
as
he
ran
ere
he
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
he
heard
the
shrill
whistle
with
which
gemmell
summoned
his
scholars
from
their
play
chapter
viii
all
the
children
had
gone
into
school
the
street
was
lonely
in
the
sudden
stillness
the
joiner
slanted
across
the
road
brushing
shavings
and
sawdust
from
his
white
apron
there
was
no
other
sign
of
life
in
the
sunshine
only
from
the
smiddy
far
away
came
at
times
the
tink
of
an
anvil
john
crept
on
up
the
street
keeping
close
to
the
wall
it
seemed
unnatural
being
there
at
that
hour
everything
had
a
quiet
unfamiliar
look
the
white
walls
of
the
houses
reproached
the
truant
with
their
silent
faces
a
strong
smell
of
wallflowers
oozed
through
the
hot
air
john
thought
it
a
lonely
smell
and
ran
to
get
away
johnny
dear
what
wrong
wi
ye
cried
his
mother
when
he
stole
in
through
the
scullery
at
last

he
said

the
sad
and
simple
expression
of
his
wish
what

my
sweet

the
school
he
said
bitterly
i

concern

fine

dirty

sloppy
dishclout

scullery

which
she
sank
exhausted
by
her
rage
oh
but
i
let

it
swaggered

i
threatened
to
knock

fleas
off

other
boys

i
would
have
walloped

they

side
she
cried
but
it
juist
envy
johnny
never

left
the
school
and
not
wan
of
them
has
the
business
that
you
have
waiting
ready
to
step
intil
mother
he
pleaded
let
me
bide
here
for
the
rest
o
the
day
oh
but
your
father
johnny
if
saw
ye
if
you
gie
me
some
o
your
novelles
to
look
at
i
go
up
to
the
garret
and
hide
and
ye
can
ask
jenny
no
to
tell
she
gave
him
a
hunk
of
nuncheon
and
a
bundle
of
her
novelettes
and
he
stole
up
to
an
empty
garret
and
squatted
on
the
bare
boards
the
sun
streamed
through
the
skylight
window
and
lay
an
oblong
patch
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
john
noted
the
head
of
a
nail
that
stuck
gleaming
up
he
could
hear
the
pigeons
on
the
roof
and
every
now
and
then
a
slithering
sound
as
they
lost
their
footing
on
the
slates
and
went
sliding
downward
to
the
rones
but
for
that
all
was
still
uncannily
still
once
a
zinc
pail
clanked
in
the
yard
and
he
started
with
fear
wondering
if
that
was
his
faither
if
young
gourlay
had
been
the
right
kind
of
a
boy
he
would
have
been
in
his
glory
with
books
to
read
and
a
garret
to
read
them
in
for
to
snuggle
close
beneath
the
slates
is
as
dear
to
the
boy
as
the
bard
if
somewhat
diverse
their
reasons
for
seclusion
your
garret
is
the
true
kingdom
of
the
poet
neighbouring
the
stars
tether
him
to
earth
but
a
skylight
looks
to
the
heavens
that
is
why
so
many
poets
live
in
garrets
no
doubt
but
it
is
the
secrecy
of
a
garret
for
him
and
his
books
that
a
boy
loves
there
he
is
lord
of
his
imagination
there
when
the
impertinent
world
is
hidden
from
his
view
he
rides
with
great
turpin
at
night
beneath
the
glimmer
of
the
moon
what
boy
of
sense
would
read
about
turpin
in
a
mere
respectable
parlour
a
the
thing
where
you
can
hide
in
a
dusty
corner
and
watch
through
a
chink
the
baffled
minions
of
bow
street
and
hear
black
bess
good
jade
stamping
in
her
secret
stall
and
be
ready
to
descend
when
a
friendly
hostler
cries
jericho
but
if
there
is
no
at
hand
a
mere
garret
will
do
very
well
and
so
john
should
have
been
in
his
glory
as
indeed
for
a
while
he
was
but
he
showed
his
difference
from
the
right
kind
of
a
boy
by
becoming
lonely
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
a
silly
kind
of
interest
in
silly
books
but
to
him
reading
was
a
painful
process
and
he
could
never
remember
the
plot
what
he
liked
best
though
he
could
not
have
told
you
about
it
was
a
vivid
physical
picture
when
the
puffing
steam
of
black
bess
nostrils
cleared
away
from
the
moonlit
pool
and
the
white
face
of
the
dead
man
stared
at
turpin
through
the
water
john
saw
it
and
shivered
staring
at
the
staring
horror
he
was
alive
to
it
all
he
heard
the
seep
of
the
water
through
the
mare
lips
and
its
hollow
glug
as
it
went
down
and
the
creak
of
the
saddle
beneath
turpin
hip
he
saw
the
smear
of
sweat
roughening
the
hair
on
her
slanting
neck
and
the
great
steaming
breath
she
blew
out
when
she
rested
from
drinking
and
then
that
awful
face
glaring
from
the
perhaps
he
was
not
so
far
from
being
the
right
kind
of
boy
after
all
since
that
was
the
stuff
that
liked
he
wished
he
had
some
turpin
with
him
now
for
his
mother
periodicals
were
all
about
men
with
impossibly
broad
shoulders
and
impossibly
curved
waists
who
asked
angelina
if
she
loved
them
once
it
is
true
a
somewhat
too
florid
sentence
touched
him
on
the
visual
nerve
through
a
chink
in
the
venetian
blind
a
long
pencil
of
yellow
light
pierced
the
beautiful
dimness
of
the
room
and
pointed
straight
to
the
dainty
bronze
slipper
peeping
from
under
angelina
gown
it
became
a
slipper
of
vivid
gold
amid
the
gloom
john
saw
that
and
brightened
but
the
next
moment
they
began
to
talk
about
love
and
he
was
at
sea
immediately
dagon
them
and
their
love
quoth
he
to
him
indeed
reading
was
never
more
than
a
means
of
escape
from
something
else
he
never
thought
of
a
book
so
long
as
there
were
things
to
see
some
things
were
different
from
others
it
is
true
things
of
the
outer
world
where
he
swaggered
among
his
fellows
and
was
thrashed
or
bungled
his
lessons
and
was
thrashed
again
imprinted
themselves
vividly
on
his
mind
and
he
hated
the
impressions
when
swipey
broon
was
hot
the
sweat
pores
always
glistened
distinctly
on
the
end
of
his
mottled
nose
john
as
he
thought
angrily
of
swipey
this
afternoon
saw
the
glistening
sweat
pores
before
him
and
wanted
to
bash
them
the
varnishy
smell
of
the
desks
the
smell
of
the
wallflowers
at
manzie
on
the
way
to
school
the
smell
of
the
school
itself
to
all
these
he
was
morbidly
alive
and
he
loathed
them
but
he
loved
the
impressions
of
his
home
his
mind
was
full
of
perceptions
of
which
he
was
unconscious
till
he
found
one
of
them
recorded
in
a
book
and
that
was
the
book
for
him
the
curious
physical
always
drew
his
mind
to
hate
it
or
to
love
in
summer
he
would
crawl
into
the
bottom
of
an
old
hedge
among
the
black
mould
and
the
withered
sticks
and
watch
a
beetle
creep
slowly
up
a
bit
of
wood
till
near
the
top
and
fall
suddenly
down
and
creep
patiently
again
this
he
would
watch
with
curious
interest
and
remember
always
johnny
said
his
mother
once
what
do
you
breenge
into
the
bushes
to
watch
those
nasty
things
for
they
queer
he
said
musingly
even
if
he
a
little
dull
wi
the
book
she
was
sure
he
would
come
to
something
for
eh
he
was
such
a
noticing
boy
but
there
was
nothing
to
touch
him
in
the
wooing
of
angeline
he
was
moving
in
an
alien
world
it
was
a
complicated
plot
and
some
of
the
numbers
being
lost
he
was
not
sharp
enough
to
catch
the
idea
of
the
story
he
read
slowly
and
without
interest
the
sounds
of
the
outer
world
reached
him
in
his
loneliness
and
annoyed
him
because
while
wondering
what
they
were
he
dared
not
look
out
to
see
he
heard
the
rattle
of
wheels
entering
the
big
yard
that
would
be
peter
riney
back
from
skeighan
with
the
range
once
he
heard
the
birr
of
his
voice
in
the
lobby
and
his
mother
speaking
in
shrill
protest
and
then
oh
horror
his
father
came
up
the
stair
would
he
come
into
the
garret
john
lying
on
his
left
side
felt
his
quickened
heart
thud
against
the
boards
and
he
could
not
take
his
big
frighted
eyes
from
the
bottom
of
the
door
but
the
heavy
step
passed
and
went
into
another
room
john
open
mouth
was
dry
and
his
shirt
was
sticking
to
his
back
the
heavy
steps
came
back
to
the
landing
whaur
gimlet
yelled
his
father
down
the
stair
oh
i
lost
the
corkscrew
and
took
it
to
open
a
bottle
cried
his
mother
wearily
here
it
is
man
in
the
kitchen
drawer
his
father
barked
and
he
knew
he
was
infernal
angry
if
he
should
come
in
but
he
went
tramping
down
the
stair
and
john
after
waiting
till
his
pulses
were
stilled
resumed
his
reading
he
heard
the
masons
in
the
kitchen
busy
with
the
range
and
he
would
have
liked
fine
to
watch
them
but
he
dared
not
go
down
till
after
four
it
was
lonely
up
here
by
himself
a
hot
wind
had
sprung
up
and
it
crooned
through
the
keyhole
drearily
it
cried
and
the
sound
drenched
him
in
a
vague
depression
the
splotch
of
yellow
light
had
shifted
round
to
the
fireplace
janet
had
kindled
a
fire
there
last
winter
and
the
ashes
had
never
been
removed
and
now
the
light
lay
yellow
and
vivid
on
a
red
clinker
of
coal
and
a
charred
piece
of
stick
a
piece
of
glossy
white
paper
had
been
flung
in
the
untidy
grate
and
in
the
hollow
curve
of
it
a
thin
silt
of
black
dust
had
gathered
the
light
showed
it
plainly
all
these
things
the
boy
marked
and
was
subtly
aware
of
their
unpleasantness
he
was
forced
to
read
to
escape
the
sense
of
them
but
it
was
words
words
words
that
he
read
the
subject
mattered
not
at
all
his
head
leaned
heavy
on
his
left
hand
and
his
mouth
hung
open
as
his
eye
travelled
dreamily
along
the
lines
he
succeeded
in
hypnotizing
his
brain
at
last
by
the
mere
process
of
staring
at
the
page
at
last
he
heard
janet
in
the
lobby
that
meant
that
school
was
over
he
crept
down
the
stair
were
playing
the
truant
said
janet
and
she
nodded
her
head
in
accusation
i
a
good
mind
to
tell
my
faither
if
ye
wud
he
said
and
shook
his
fist
at
her
threateningly
she
shrank
away
from
him
they
went
into
the
kitchen
together
the
range
had
been
successfully
installed
and
gourlay
was
showing
it
to
grant
of
loranogie
the
foremost
farmer
of
the
shire
gourlay
standing
by
the
kitchen
table
viewed
her
new
possession
with
a
faded
simper
of
approval
she
was
pleased
that
grant
should
see
the
grand
new
thing
that
they
had
gotten
she
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
men
with
a
faint
smile
about
her
weary
lips
her
eyes
upon
the
sonsy
range
dod
it
a
handsome
piece
of
furniture
said
loranogie
how
did
ye
get
it
brought
here
mr
gourlay
i
went
to
glasgow
and
ordered
it
special
it
came
to
skeighan
by
the
train
and
my
own
beasts
brought
it
owre
that
fender
a
feature
he
added
complacently
it
onusual
wi
a
range
the
massive
fender
ran
from
end
to
end
of
the
fireplace
projecting
a
little
in
front
its
rim
a
square
bar
of
heavy
steel
with
bright
sharp
edges
and
that
poker
too
man
there
a
history
wi
that
i
made
a
point
of
the
making
he
was
an
little
whalp
the
bodie
in
glasgow
i
happened
to
say
till
um
i
would
like
a
just
the
same
size
as
the
rim
of
the
fender
d
want
wi
a
poker
says
he
ye
need
a
bit
sma
thing
to
rype
the
ribs
wi
that
so
says
i
do
ken
what
want
i
made
short
work
o
the
the
identical
size
o
the
rim
i
had
it
made
to
fit
loranogie
thought
it
a
silly
thing
of
gourlay
to
concern
himself
about
a
poker
but
that
was
just
like
him
of
course
the
moment
the
body
in
glasgow
opposed
his
whim
gourlay
he
knew
would
make
a
point
the
grain
merchant
took
the
bar
of
heavy
metal
in
his
hand
dod
an
awful
weapon
he
said
meaning
to
be
jocose
you
could
murder
a
man
deed
you
could
said
loranogie
you
could
kill
him
wi
the
one
lick
the
elders
engaged
with
more
important
matters
paid
no
attention
to
the
children
who
had
pushed
between
them
to
the
front
and
were
looking
up
at
their
faces
as
they
talked
with
curious
watching
eyes
john
with
his
instinct
to
notice
things
took
the
poker
up
when
his
father
laid
it
down
to
see
if
it
was
really
the
size
of
the
rim
it
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
raise
by
the
handle
he
had
to
lift
it
by
the
middle
janet
was
at
his
elbow
watching
him
you
could
kill
a
man
with
that
he
told
her
importantly
though
she
had
heard
it
for
herself
janet
stared
and
shuddered
then
the
boy
laid
the
along
the
rim
fitting
edge
to
edge
with
a
nice
precision
mother
he
cried
turning
towards
her
in
his
interest
mother

here
it
exactly
the
same
size

it

said
his
father

and
there
a
gey
pickle
stuff
waiting
at
the
cross
the
hot
wind
of
yesterday
had
brought
lightning
through
the
night
and
this
morning
there
was
the
gentle
drizzle
that
sometimes
follows
a
heavy
thunderstorm
hints
of
the
farther
blue
showed
themselves
in
a
lofty
sky
of
delicate
and
drifting
gray
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
welcomed
the
cooler
air
with
a
gush
of
musical
piping
as
if
the
liquid
tenderness
of
the
morning
had
actually
got
into
their
throats
and
made
them
softer
you
had
better
snoove
away
then
said
gourlay
donnerton
five
mile
ayont
fleckie
and
by
the
time
you
deliver
the
meal
there
and
load
the
ironwork
it
be
late
ere
you
get
back
snoove
away
peter
snoove
away
peter
shuffled
uneasily
and
his
pale
blue
eyes
blinked
at
gourlay
from
beneath
their
grizzled
crow
nests
of
red
hair
are
we
a
to
start
thegither
sir
he
hesitated
d
mean
d
mean
the
carriers
too
atweel
peter
said
gourlay
what
for
no
peter
took
a
great
old
watch
with
a
yellow
case
from
his
fob
and
it
wants
a
while
o
aicht
sir
he
volunteered
ay
man
peter
and
what
of
that
said
gourlay
there
was
almost
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
peter
riney
was
the
only
human
being
with
whom
he
was
ever
really
at
his
ease
it
is
only
when
a
mind
feels
secure
in
itself
that
it
can
laugh
unconcernedly
at
others
peter
was
so
simple
that
in
his
presence
gourlay
felt
secure
and
he
used
to
banter
him
the
folk
at
the
cross
winna
expect
the
carriers
till
aicht
sir
said
peter
and
i
doubt
their
stuff
wo
be
ready
ay
man
peter
gourlay
joked
lazily
as
if
peter
was
a
little
boy
ay
man
peter
you
think
the
folk
at
the
cross
winna
be
prepared
no
sir
said
peter
opening
his
eyes
very
solemnly
they
winna
be
prepared
it
do
them
good
to
hurry
a
little
for
once
growled
gourlay
humour
yielding
to
spite
at
the
thought
of
his
enemies
it
do
them
good
to
hurry
a
little
for
once
be
off
the
lot
of
ye
after
ordering
his
carriers
to
start
to
back
down
and
postpone
their
departure
just
to
suit
the
convenience
of
his
neighbours
would
derogate
from
his
own
importance
his
men
might
think
he
was
afraid
of
barbie
he
strolled
out
to
the
big
gate
and
watched
his
teams
going
down
the
brae
there
were
only
four
carts
this
morning
because
the
two
that
had
gone
to
fechars
yesterday
with
the
cheese
would
not
be
back
till
the
afternoon
and
another
had
already
turned
west
to
auchterwheeze
to
bring
slates
for
the
flesher
new
house
of
the
four
that
went
down
the
street
two
were
the
usual
carriers
carts
the
other
two
were
off
to
fleckie
with
meal
and
gourlay
had
started
them
the
sooner
since
they
were
to
bring
back
the
ironwork
which
templandmuir
needed
for
his
new
improvements
though
the
templar
had
reformed
greatly
since
he
married
his
birkie
wife
he
was
still
far
from
having
his
place
in
proper
order
and
he
had
often
to
depend
on
gourlay
for
the
carrying
of
stuff
which
a
man
in
his
position
should
have
had
horses
of
his
own
to
bring
as
gourlay
stood
at
his
gate
he
pondered
with
heavy
cunning
how
much
he
might
charge
templandmuir
for
bringing
the
ironwork
from
fleckie
he
decided
to
charge
him
for
the
whole
day
though
half
of
it
would
be
spent
in
taking
his
own
meal
to
donnerton
in
that
he
was
carrying
out
his
usual
policy
which
was
to
make
each
side
of
his
business
help
the
other
as
he
stood
puzzling
his
wits
over
templandmuir
account
his
lips
worked
in
and
out
to
assist
the
slow
process
of
his
brain
his
eyes
narrowed
between
peering
lids
and
their
light
seemed
to
turn
inward
as
he
fixed
them
abstractedly
on
a
stone
in
the
middle
of
the
road
his
head
was
tilted
that
he
might
keep
his
eyes
upon
the
stone
and
every
now
and
then
as
he
mused
he
rubbed
his
chin
slowly
between
the
thumb
and
fingers
of
his
left
hand
entirely
given
up
to
the
thought
of
templandmuir
account
he
failed
to
see
the
figure
advancing
up
the
street
at
last
the
scrunch
of
a
boot
on
the
wet
road
struck
his
ear
he
turned
with
his
best
glower
on
the
man
who
was
approaching
more
of
the
look
than
ever
in
his
eyes
because
he
had
been
caught
unawares
the
stranger
wore
a
light
yellow
overcoat
and
he
had
been
walking
a
long
time
in
the
rain
apparently
for
the
shoulders
of
the
coat
were
quite
black
with
the
wet
these
black
patches
showing
in
strong
contrast
with
the
dryer
therefore
yellower
front
of
it
coat
and
jacket
were
both
hanging
slightly
open
and
between
was
seen
the
slight
bulge
of
a
dirty
white
waistcoat
the
newcomer
trousers
were
turned
high
at
the
bottom
and
the
muddy
spats
he
wore
looked
big
and
ungainly
in
consequence
in
this
appearance
there
was
an
air
of
dirty
and
pretentious
it
was
not
shabby
gentility
it
was
like
the
gross
attempt
at
dress
of
your
publican
who
looks
down
on
his
soiled
white
waistcoat
with
complacent
and
approving
eye
it
a
fine
morning
gourlay
simpered
the
stranger
his
air
was
that
of
a
forward
tenant
who
thinks
it
a
great
thing
to
pass
remarks
on
the
weather
with
his
laird
gourlay
cast
a
look
at
the
dropping
heavens
is
that
opinion
said
he
i
fail
to
mysell
it
was
not
in
gourlay
to
see
the
beauty
of
that
gray
wet
dawn
a
fine
morning
to
him
was
one
that
burnt
the
back
of
your
neck
the
stranger
laughed
a
little
deprecating
giggle
i
meant
it
was
fine
weather
for
the
fields
he
explained
he
had
meant
nothing
of
the
kind
of
course
he
had
merely
been
talking
at
random
in
his
wish
to
be
civil
to
that
important
man
john
gourlay
imphm
he
pondered
looking
round
on
the
weather
with
a
wise
air
imphm
it
fine
weather
for
the
fields
are
a
farmer
then
gourlay
nipped
him
with
his
eye
on
the
white
waistcoat
oh
oh
gourlay
a
farmer
no
hi
hi
i
not
a
farmer
i
dare
say
now
you
have
no
mind
of
no
said
gourlay
regarding
him
very
gravely
and
steadily
with
his
dark
eyes
i
can
not
say
sir
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
remembering
man
i
a
son
of
auld
john
wilson
of
brigabee
oh
auld
wilson
the
said
contemptuous
gourlay
this
they
christened
him
now
johnnie
was
it
noat
wilson
coloured
but
he
sniggered
to
gloss
over
the
awkwardness
of
the
remark
a
coward
always
sniggers
when
insulted
pretending
that
the
insult
is
only
a
joke
of
his
opponent
and
therefore
to
be
laughed
aside
so
he
escapes
the
quarrel
which
he
fears
a
show
of
displeasure
might
provoke
but
though
wilson
was
not
a
hardy
man
it
was
not
timidity
only
that
caused
his
tame
submission
to
gourlay
he
had
come
back
after
an
absence
of
fifteen
years
with
a
good
deal
of
money
in
his
pocket
and
he
had
a
fond
desire
that
he
the
son
of
the
should
get
some
recognition
of
his
prosperity
from
the
most
important
man
in
the
locality
if
gourlay
had
said
with
solemn
and
approval
man
i
glad
to
see
that
you
have
done
so
well
he
would
have
swelled
with
gratified
pride
for
it
is
often
the
favourable
estimate
of
their
own
little
village
what
they
think
of
me
at
home
that
matters
most
to
scotsmen
who
go
out
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
no
doubt
that
is
why
so
many
of
them
go
home
and
cut
a
dash
when
they
have
made
their
fortunes
they
want
the
cronies
of
their
youth
to
see
the
big
men
they
have
become
wilson
was
not
exempt
from
that
weakness
as
far
back
as
he
remembered
gourlay
had
been
the
big
man
of
barbie
as
a
boy
he
had
viewed
him
with
admiring
awe
to
be
received
by
him
now
as
one
of
the
were
a
sweet
recognition
of
his
greatness
it
was
a
fawning
desire
for
that
recognition
that
caused
his
smirking
approach
to
the
grain
merchant
so
strong
was
the
desire
that
though
he
coloured
and
felt
awkward
at
the
contemptuous
reference
to
his
father
he
sniggered
and
went
on
talking
as
if
nothing
untoward
had
been
said
he
was
one
of
the
band
impossible
to
snub
not
because
they
are
endowed
with
superior
moral
courage
but
because
their
easy
is
so
great
that
an
insult
rarely
pierces
it
enough
to
divert
them
from
their
purpose
they
walk
through
life
wrapped
comfortably
round
in
the
wool
of
their
own
conceit
gourlay
though
a
dull
man
perhaps
because
he
was
a
dull
man
suspected
insult
in
a
moment
but
it
rarely
entered
wilson
brain
though
he
was
cleverer
than
most
that
the
world
could
find
anything
to
scoff
at
in
such
a
fine
fellow
as
james
wilson
a
less
ironic
brute
than
gourlay
would
never
have
pierced
the
thickness
of
his
hide
it
was
because
gourlay
succeeded
in
piercing
it
that
morning
that
wilson
hated
him
for
ever
with
a
hate
the
more
bitter
because
he
was
rebuffed
so
seldom
is
business
brisk
he
asked
irrepressible
business
heavens
did
ye
hear
him
talking
what
did
toddling
son
know
about
business
what
was
the
world
coming
to
to
hear
him
setting
up
his
face
there
and
asking
the
best
merchant
in
the
town
whether
business
was
brisk
it
was
high
time
to
put
him
in
his
place
the
conceited
upstart
shoving
himself
forward
like
an
equal
for
it
was
the
assumption
of
equality
implied
by
wilson
manner
that
offended
gourlay
as
if
son
and
monopolist
were
discussing
on
equal
terms
matters
of
interest
to
them
both
business
he
said
gravely
well
i
not
well
acquainted
with
your
line
but
i
believe
mole
traps
are
cheap
if
ye
have
any
idea
of
taking
up
the
oald
trade
wilson
eyes
flickered
over
him
hurt
and
dubious
his
mouth
opened
then
shut
then
he
decided
to
speak
after
all
oh
i
was
thinking
barbie
would
be
very
quiet
said
he
compared
wi
places
where
they
have
the
railway
i
was
thinking
it
would
need
stirring
up
a
bit
oh
ye
was
thinking
that
was
ye
birred
gourlay
with
a
stupid
repetition
of
his
jibe
well
i
believe
there
a
grand
opening
in
the
moleskin
line
so
a
chance
for
ye
my
quarrymen
wear
out
their
breeks
in
no
time
wilson
face
which
had
swelled
with
red
shame
went
a
dead
white
he
said
and
started
rapidly
away
with
a
vicious
dig
of
his
stick
upon
the
wet
road
serr
gourlay
birred
after
him
serr
he
felt
he
had
been
bright
this
morning
he
had
put
the
branks
on
wilson
wilson
was
as
furious
at
himself
as
at
gourlay
why
the
devil
had
he
said
it
had
slipped
out
of
him
unawares
and
gourlay
had
taken
it
up
with
an
ironic
birr
that
rang
in
his
ears
now
poisoning
his
blood
he
felt
equal
in
fancy
to
a
thousand
gourlays
now
so
strong
was
he
in
wrath
against
him
he
had
gone
forward
to
pass
pleasant
remarks
about
the
weather
and
why
should
he
noat
he
was
no
disgrace
to
barbie
but
a
credit
rather
it
was
not
every
son
that
came
back
with
five
hundred
in
the
bank
and
here
gourlay
had
treated
him
like
a
doag
ah
well
he
would
maybe
be
upsides
with
gourlay
yet
so
he
might
chapter
x
such
a
rickle
of
furniture
i
never
saw
said
the
provost
whose
is
it
said
brodie
oh

ye
noat
heard
said
the
head
of
the
town
with
eyebrows
in
air
it
beloangs
to
that
fellow
wilson
doa
ye
know
he
a
son
of
oald
wilson

of
brigabee

have
him
for
a
neighbour
or
all

i
declare

what
this
world

to
man
provost
said
brodie
d

over
at
fleckie
for
the
last
ten
days
my
brother
rab
dead
and
won
away
as
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
oh
yes
we
must
all
go
so
ye
see
scarcely
abreast
o
the
latest
intelligence
what
wilson
doing
here
i
thought
he
had
been
a
pawnbroker
in
embro
noat
he
it
indeed
that
he
left
brigabee
to
go
and
help
in
a
pawmbroker
but
it
seems
he
married
an
aberdeen
lass
and
sattled
there
after
a
while
the
manager
of
a
store
i
have
been
given
to
he
has
taken
oald
rab
jamieson
barn
at
the
bottom
of
the
cross
for
what
purpose
it
beats
even
me
to
tell
and
that
his
furniture
i
declare
said
the
astonished
brodie
he
a
boy
that
will
that
be
a
son
of
his
he
pointed
to
a
urchin
of
twelve
who
was
busy
carrying
chairs
round
the
corner
of
the
barn
to
the
tiny
house
where
wilson
meant
to
live
he
was
a
boy
with
an
upturned
nose
dressed
in
shirt
and
knickerbockers
only
the
cross
of
his
braces
came
comically
near
his
neck
so
short
was
the
space
of
shirt
between
the
top
line
of
his
breeches
and
his
shoulders
his
knickers
were
open
at
the
knee
and
the
black
stockings
below
them
were
wrinkled
slackly
down
his
thin
legs
being
tied
loosely
above
the
calf
with
dirty
white
strips
of
cloth
instead
of
garters
he
had
no
cap
and
it
was
seen
that
his
hair
had
a
in
front
it
slanted
up
from
his
brow
that
is
in
a
sleek
kind
of
tuft
there
was
a
violent
squint
in
one
of
his
sharp
gray
eyes
so
that
it
seemed
to
flash
at
the
world
across
the
bridge
of
his
nose
he
was
so
eager
at
his
work
that
his
boots
they
only
clumsy
because
the
legs
they
were
stuck
to
were
so
thin
skidded
on
the
cobbles
as
he
whipped
round
the
barn
with
a
chair
inverted
on
his
poll
when
he
came
back
for
another
chair
he
sometimes
wheepled
a
tune
of
his
own
making
in
shrill
disconnected
jerks
and
sometimes
wiped
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
and
the
bodies
watched
him
faith
he
keen
said
the
provost
but
what
on
earth
has
wilson
auld
jamieson
house
and
barn
for
they
have
stude
empty
since
i
kenna
whan

me
and
he
thinks

a
lowe
ou

perfect

said
johnny
coe
in
barbie
cried
astounded
toddle
in
barbie
said
the
provost
it
would
take
a
heap
to
revolutionize
said
the
baker
the
ironic
man
there

chance
in
that
hoose
brodie
burst
out
ignoring
the
gibe
dod
there
a
chance
sirs
i
wonder
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
are
ye
thinking
ye
have
missed
a
gude
thing
grinned
the
deacon
but
brodie
lips
were
working
in
the
throes
of
commercial
speculation
and
he
stared
heedless
of
the
jibe
so
johnny
coe
took
up
his
sapient
parable
atweel
said
he
there
a
chance
brodie
that
road
round
to
the
back
a
handy
thing
you
could
take
a
horse
and
cart
brawly
through
an
opening
like
that
and
there
a
gey
bit
ground
at
the
back
too
when
a
body
comes
to
think
what
line
he
meaning
to
purshoo
queried
brodie
whose
mind
quickened
by
the
chance
he
saw
at
no
the
cross
was
hot
on
the
hunt
of
its
possibilities
he
been
very
close
about

said
the
provost
i
asked
johnny
gibson
it
was
him

the
selling
but
he
could
give
me
ainy
satisfaction
all
he
could
say

sandy

very
clever
man

the
provost
we
soon
see
what
he
meaning
to
be
at
now
that
his
furniture
in
he
surely
canna
keep
us
in
the
dark
much
loanger
their
curiosity
was
soon
appeased
within
a
week
they
were
privileged
to
read
the
notice
here
appended
james
wilson
begs
to
announce
to
the
inhabitants
of
barbie
and
surrounding
neighbourhood
that

has

open

grocery

an
emporium

long
been
a
felt
want
in
the
locality
to
meet
this
want
is
intention
he
will
try
to
do
so
not
by
making
large
profits
on
a
small
business
but
by
making
small
profits
on
a
large
business
indeed
owing
to
his
long
acquaintance
with
the
trade
wilson
will
be
able
to
supply
all
commodities
at
a
very
little
over
cost
price
for
will
use
those
improved
methods
of
business
which
have
been
confined
hitherto
to
the
larger
centres
of
population
at
his
emporium

will
be
able
as
the
saying

anchor

of
his
customers

ladies

faithfully
james
wilson
such
was
the
poster
with
which
barbie
and
surrounding
neighbourhood
were
besprinkled
within
a
week
of
appearance
on
the
scene
he
was
known
as
ever
after
to
be
known
by
your
initials
is
sometimes
a
mark
of
affection
and
sometimes
a
mark
of
disrespect
it
was
not
a
mark
of
affection
in
the
case
of
our
when
donald
scott
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
cried
hullo
how
are
the
anchors
selling
barbie
had
found
a
cue
which
it
was
not
slow
to
make
use
of
wilson
even
received
letters
addressed
to
anchor
merchant
no
the
cross
ours
is
a
nippy
locality
but
wilson
cosy
and
cocky
in
his
own
good
opinion
was
impervious
to
the
chilly
winds
of
scorn
his
posters
in
big
blue
letters
were
on
the
smiddy
door
and
on
the
sides
of
every
brig
within
a
circuit
of
five
miles
they
were
pasted
in
smaller
letters
red
on
the
gateposts
of
every
farm
and
robin
tam
the
bellman
handed
them
about
from
door
to
door
the
folk
could
talk
of
nothing
else
dod
said
the
provost
when
he
read
the
bill
we
a
new
departure
here
this
is
an
unco
splutter
as
the
oald
sow
said
when
she
tumbled
in
the
gutter
ay
said
sandy
toddle
a
fuff
in
the
pan
i
thinking
he
promises
owre
muckle
to
last
long
he
lauchs
owre
loud
to
be
merry
at
the
end
for
the
loudest
bummler
no
the
best
bee
as
my
father
honest
man
used
to
tell
the
minister
i
no
so
sure
o
that
said
tam
brodie
i
forgathered
wilson
on
wednesday
last
and
i
tell
ye
sirs
he
worth
the
watching
they
need
to
stand
on
a
baikie
that
put
the
branks
on
him
he
has
the
considering
eye
in
his
head
yon
lang
glimmer
at
a
thing
from
out
the
end
of
the
eyebrow
he
turned
it
on
mysell
times
the
cunning
devil
trying
to
keek
into
me
to
see
if
he
could
use
me
and
look
at
the
chance
he
has
there
two
stores
in
barbie
to
be
sure
but
kinnikum
a
dirty
beast
and
folk
have
a
scunner
at
his
goods
and
catherwood
a
drucken
swine
and
his
place
but
sairly
guided
that
a
great
stroke
o
policy
too
promising
to
deliver
folk
goods
on
their
own
doorstep
to
them
there
a
whole
of
outlying
clachans
round
barbie
that
he
get
the
trade
of
by
a
dodge
like
that
the
like
was
never
tried
hereaway
before
i
wadna
wonder
but
it
works
wonders
it
did
it
was
partly
policy
and
partly
accident
that
brought
wilson
back
to
barbie
he
had
been
managing
a
wealthy
old
merchant
store
for
a
long
time
in
aberdeen
and
he
had
been
blithely
looking
forward
to
the
goodwill
of
it
when
jink
at
the
old
man
death
in
stepped
a
nephew
and
ousted
the
fellow
he
had
bawled
shrilly
but
to
no
purpose
he
had
to
be
travelling
when
he
rose
to
greatness
in
barbie
it
was
whispered
that
the
nephew
discovered
he
was
feathering
his
own
nest
and
that
this
was
the
reason
of
his
sharp
dismissal
but
perhaps
we
should
credit
that
report
to
barbie
disposition
rather
than
to
misdemeanour
wilson
might
have
set
up
for
himself
in
the
nippy
northern
town
but
it
is
an
instinct
with
men
who
have
met
with
a
rebuff
in
a
place
to
shake
its
dust
from
their
shoes
and
be
off
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
the
larger
world
we
take
a
scunner
at
the
place
that
has
us
wilson
took
a
scunner
at
aberdeen
and
decided
to
leave
it
and
look
around
him
scotland
was
opening
up
and
there
were
bound
to
be
heaps
of
chances
for
a
man
like
him
a
man
like
me
was
a
frequent
phrase
of
wilson
retired
and
solitary
speculation
ay
he
said
emerging
from
one
of
his
business
reveries
there
bound
to
be
heaps
o
chances
for
a
man
like
me
if
i
only
look
about
me
he
was
looking
about
him
in
glasgow
when
he
forgathered
with
his
cousin
william
the
borer
he
after
many
how
are
ye
jims
and
mutual
speirings
over
a
bit
mouthful
of
yill
so
they
phrased
it
but
that
was
a
meiosis
for
they
drank
five
quarts
they
fell
to
a
serious
discussion
of
the
commercial
possibilities
of
scotland
the
borer
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
braes
of
barbie
had
a
future
yet
for
a
the
gaffer
was
so
keen
on
keeping
his
men
in
the
dark
about
the
coal
now
wilson
knew
as
what
scotsman
does
not
that
in
the
middle
in
scotland
was
not
the
honourable
profession
that
it
now
is
more
than
once
speculators
procured
lying
reports
that
there
were
no
minerals
and
after
landowners
had
been
ruined
by
their
abortive
preliminary
experiments
stepped
in
bought
the
land
and
boomed
it
in
one
notorious
case
a
family
now
great
in
the
public
eye
bribed
a
laird
own
borers
to
conceal
the
truth
and
then
buying
the
golconda
from
its
impoverished
owner
laid
the
basis
of
a
vast
fortune
d
mean
to
tell
weelyum
wilson
said
james
giving
him
his
full
name
in
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
d
mean
to
tell
sir
here
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
that
there
at
work
a
declare
to
god
a
div
said
weelyum
with
equal
solemnity
and
he
nodded
with
alarmed
sapience
across
his
beer
jug
you
believe
there
plenty
of
coal
up
barbie
valley
and
that
keeping
it
dark
in
the
meantime
for
some
purpose
of
their
own
i
do
said
weelyum
god
said
james
gripping
the
table
with
both
hands
in
his
excitement
god
if
that
so
what
a
chance
there
in
barbie
it
has
been
a
dead
town
for
twenty
year
and
twenty
to
the
end
a
verra
little
would
buy
the
hauf
but
property
rise
in
value
like
a
puddock
stool
at
dark
serr
if
the
pits
come
round
it
it
will
that
if
i
was
only
sure
o
your
suspeecion
weelyum
i
invest
every
bawbee
i
have
i
you
going
home
the
night
are
ye
not
i
was
just
on
my
road
to
the
station
when
i
met
ye
said
weelyum
send
me
a
scrape
of
your
pen
man
if
what
you
see
on
getting
back
keeps
you
still
in
the
same
mind
and
directly
i
get
your
letter
i
run
down
and
look
about
me
the
letter
was
encouraging
and
wilson
went
forth
to
spy
the
land
and
initiate
the
plan
of
campaign
it
was
an
important
day
for
him
he
entered
on
his
feud
with
gourlay
and
bought
rab
jamieson
house
and
barn
with
the
field
behind
it
for
a
trifle
he
had
five
hundred
of
his
own
and
he
knew
where
more
could
be
had
for
the
asking
rab
jamieson
barn
was
a
curious
building
to
be
stranded
in
the
midst
of
barbie
in
quaint
villages
and
little
towns
of
england
you
sometimes
see
a
mellow
barn
with
its
rich
yard
close
upon
the
street
it
seems
to
have
been
hemmed
in
by
the
houses
round
while
dozing
so
that
it
could
not
escape
with
the
fields
fleeing
from
the
town
there
it
remains
and
gives
a
ripeness
to
the
place
matching
fitly
with
the
great
yellowing
before
the
door
and
the
old
inn
further
down
mantled
in
its
creepers
but
that
autumnal
warmth
and
cosiness
is
rarely
seen
in
the
barer
streets
of
the
north
how
rab
barn
came
to
be
stuck
in
barbie
nobody
could
tell
it
was
a
gaunt
gray
building
with
never
a
window
but
a
bole
high
in
one
corner
for
the
sheaves
and
a
door
low
in
another
corner
for
auld
rab
jamieson
there
was
no
mill
inside
and
the
place
had
not
been
used
for
years
but
the
roof
was
good
and
the
walls
stout
and
thick
and
wilson
soon
got
to
work
on
his
new
possession
he
had
seen
all
that
could
be
made
of
the
place
the
moment
he
clapped
an
eye
on
it
and
he
knew
that
he
had
found
a
good
thing
even
if
the
pits
should
never
come
near
barbie
the
bole
and
door
next
the
street
were
walled
up
and
a
fine
new
door
opened
in
the
middle
flanked
on
either
side
by
a
great
window
the
interior
was
fitted
up
with
a
couple
of
counters
and
a
wooden
floor
and
above
the
new
wood
ceiling
there
was
a
long
loft
for
a
storeroom
lighted
by
skylights
in
the
roof
that
loft
above
the
rafters
thought
the
provident
wilson
will
come
in
braw
and
handy
for
storing
things
so
it
will
and
there
hey
presto
the
transformation
was
achieved
and
wilson
emporium
stood
before
you
it
was
crammed
with
merchandise
on
the
white
flapping
slant
of
a
couple
of
awnings
one
over
each
window
you
might
read
in
black
letters
james
wilson
emporium
the
letters
of
james
wilson
made
a
triumphal
arch
to
which
emporium
was
the
base
it
seemed
symbolical
now
the
shops
of
barbie
the
drunken
man
shop
and
the
dirty
shop
always
excepted
of
course
had
usually
been
little
places
with
faded
black
scrolls
above
the
door
on
which
you
might
read
in
dim
gilt
letters
or
it
might
be
in
white
licens
to
sell
tea
tobacco
licens
was
on
one
corner
of
the
ribboned
scroll
to
sell
tea
occupied
the
flowing
arch
above
with
tobacco
in
the
other
corner
when
you
mounted
two
steps
and
opened
the
door
a
bell
of
some
kind
went
in
the
interior
and
an
old
woman
in
a
mutch
with
big
specs
slipping
down
her
nose
would
come
up
a
step
from
a
dim
little
room
behind
and
wiping
her
sunken
mouth
with
her
apron
she
had
just
left
her
tea
would
say
what
your
wull
the
day
sir
and
if
you
said
your
wull
was
tobacco
she
would
answer
ou
sir
i
dinna
sell
ocht
now
but
the
tape
and
sweeties
and
then
you
went
away
sadly
with
the
exception
of
the
dirty
man
shop
and
the
drunken
man
shop
that
kind
of
shop
was
the
barbie
kind
of
shop
but
wilson
changed
all
that
one
side
of
the
emporium
was
crammed
with
pots
pans
pails
scythes
gardening
implements
and
saws
with
a
big
barrel
of
paraffin
partitioned
off
in
a
corner
the
rafters
on
that
side
were
bristling
and
hoary
with
brushes
of
all
kinds
dependent
from
the
roof
so
that
the
minister
wife
who
was
a
went
off
with
a
brush
in
her
bonnet
once
behind
the
other
counter
were
canisters
in
goodly
rows
barrels
of
flour
and
bags
of
meal
and
great
yellow
cheeses
in
the
window
the
rafters
here
were
heavy
with
their
wealth
of
hams
flitches
of
bacon
interspersed
with
the
white
barbie
best
as
wilson
christened
it
all
along
the
back
in
glass
cases
to
keep
them
unsullied
were
bales
of
cloth
layer
on
layer
to
the
roof
it
was
a
pleasure
to
go
into
the
place
so
big
and
bien
was
it
and
to
smell
it
on
a
frosty
night
set
your
teeth
watering
there
was
always
a
big
barrel
of
american
apples
just
inside
the
door
and
their
homely
fragrance
wooed
you
from
afar
the
mellow
savour
cuddling
round
you
half
a
mile
off
barbie
boys
had
despised
the
provision
trade
heretofore
as
a
mean
and
meagre
occupation
but
now
the
imagination
of
each
gallant
youth
was
fired
and
radiant
he
meant
to
be
a
grocer
wilson
presided
over
the
emporium
wilson
had
a
treasure
in
his
wife
she
was
aberdeen
born
and
bred
but
her
manner
was
the
manner
of
the
south
and
west
there
is
a
broad
difference
of
character
between
the
peoples
of
east
and
west
scotland
the
east
throws
a
narrower
and
a
nippier
breed
in
the
west
they
take
burns
for
their
exemplar
and
affect
the
jovial
and
robustious
in
some
cases
it
is
affectation
only
and
a
mighty
poor
one
at
that
they
claim
to
be
bigger
men
and
bigger
fools
than
the
eastern
billies
and
the
eastern
billies
are
very
willing
to
yield
one
half
of
the
contention
wilson
though
eastie
by
nature
had
the
jovial
manner
that
you
find
in
kyle
more
jovial
indeed
than
was
common
in
nippy
barbie
which
in
general
character
seems
to
have
been
transplanted
from
some
sand
dune
looking
out
upon
the
german
ocean
she
was
big
of
hip
and
bosom
with
hair
and
eyes
and
a
ruddy
cheek
and
when
she
flung
back
her
head
for
the
laugh
her
white
teeth
flashed
splendid
on
the
world
that
laugh
of
hers
became
one
of
the
features
of
barbie
a
startled
visitor
would
cry
whatna
oh
dinna
be
alarmed
a
native
would
comfort
him
it
only
wilson
wife
lauchin
at
the
cross
her
manner
had
a
hearty
charm
she
had
a
laugh
and
a
joke
for
every
customer
quick
as
a
wink
with
her
answer
her
gibe
was
in
you
and
out
again
before
you
knew
you
were
wounded
some
it
is
true
took
exception
to
the
loudness
of
her
skirl
the
deacon
for
instance
who
gave
her
a
good
one
the
first
time
he
went
in
for
snuff
but
tut
quoth
she
a
mim
cat
never
gude
at
the
mice
and
she
lifted
him
out
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
crying
run
mousie
or
i
catch
ye
on
that
day
her
popularity
in
barbie
was
assured
for
ever
but
she
was
as
keen
on
the
penny
as
a
penurious
weaver
for
all
her
heartiness
and
laughing
ways
she
combined
the
commercial
merits
of
the
east
and
west
she
could
coax
you
to
the
buying
like
a
cumnock
quean
and
fleece
you
in
the
selling
like
the
cadgers
o
kincardine
when
wilson
was
abroad
on
his
affairs
he
had
no
need
to
be
afraid
that
things
were
mismanaging
at
home
during
his
first
year
in
barbie
wilson
was
his
sole
helper
she
had
the
brawny
arm
of
a
giantess
and
could
toss
a
bag
of
meal
like
a
baby
to
see
her
twirl
a
big
ham
on
the
counter
was
to
see
a
thing
done
as
it
should
be
when
drucken
wabster
came
in
and
was
offensive
once
fellow
said
she
with
a
wink
to
a
customer
i
declare
he
in
a
high
fever
and
she
took
him
kicking
to
the
pump
and
cooled
him
with
a
mate
like
that
at
the
helm
every
sail
of
wilson
craft
was
trimmed
for
prosperity
he
began
to
look
about
him
to
increase
the
fleet
chapter
xi
that
the
scot
is
largely
endowed
with
the
commercial
imagination
his
foes
will
be
ready
to
acknowledge
imagination
may
consecrate
the
world
to
a
man
or
it
may
merely
be
a
visualizing
faculty
which
sees
that
as
already
perfect
which
is
still
lying
in
the
raw
material
the
scot
has
the
lower
faculty
in
full
degree
he
has
the
forecasting
leap
of
the
mind
which
sees
what
to
make
of
things
more
sees
them
made
and
in
vivid
operation
to
him
there
is
a
railway
through
the
desert
where
no
railway
exists
and
mills
along
the
quiet
stream
and
his
is
quick
to
attempt
the
realizing
of
his
dreams
that
is
why
he
makes
the
best
of
colonists
galt
is
his
type
galt
dreaming
in
boyhood
of
the
fine
water
power
a
fellow
could
bring
round
the
hill
from
the
stream
where
he
went
they
have
done
it
since
dreaming
in
manhood
of
the
cities
yet
to
rise
amid
ontario
woods
they
are
there
to
witness
to
his
foresight
indeed
so
flushed
and
riotous
can
the
scottish
mind
become
over
a
commercial
prospect
that
it
sometimes
sends
native
caution
by
the
board
and
a
man
really
fine
idea
becomes
an
empty
balloon
to
carry
him
off
to
the
limbo
of
vanities
there
is
a
megalomaniac
in
every
parish
of
scotland
well
not
so
much
as
that
they
owre
canny
for
that
to
be
said
of
them
but
in
every
district
almost
you
may
find
a
poor
creature
who
for
thirty
years
has
cherished
a
great
scheme
by
which
he
means
to
revolutionize
the
world
commerce
and
amass
a
fortune
in
monstrous
degree
he
is
generally
to
be
seen
shivering
at
the
cross
and
if
you
are
a
nippy
man
you
shout
carelessly
in
going
by
tamson
how
the
scheme
and
he
would
be
very
willing
to
tell
you
if
only
you
would
wait
to
listen
man
he
will
cry
eagerly
behind
you
if
i
only
had
anither
wee
wheel
in
my
invention
she
would
do
the
besom
i
sune
have
her
ready
noo
poor
tamson
but
these
are
the
exceptions
scotsmen
more
than
other
men
perhaps
have
the
three
great
essentials
of
commercial
success
imagination
to
conceive
schemes
common
sense
to
correct
them
and
energy
to
push
them
through
common
sense
indeed
so
far
from
being
wanting
is
in
most
cases
too
much
in
evidence
perhaps
crippling
the
soaring
mind
and
robbing
the
idea
of
its
early
radiance
in
quieter
language
she
makes
the
average
scotsman
to
be
his
combinations
are
rarely
napoleonic
until
he
becomes
an
american
in
his
native
dales
he
seldom
ventures
on
a
daring
policy
and
yet
his
forecasting
mind
is
always
detecting
possibeelities
so
he
contents
himself
by
creeping
cautiously
from
point
to
point
ignoring
big
reckless
schemes
and
using
the
safe
and
small
till
he
arrives
at
a
florid
opulence
he
has
expressed
his
love
of
in
business
in
a
score
of
proverbs
the
better
horse
though
the
baulder
ca
canny
or
ye
cowp
many
a
little
makes
a
mickle
and
creep
before
ye
gang
this
mingling
of
caution
and
imagination
is
the
cause
of
his
stable
prosperity
and
its
characteristic
is
a
sure
progressiveness
that
sure
progressiveness
was
the
characteristic
of
wilson
prosperity
in
barbie
in
him
too
imagination
and
caution
were
equally
developed
he
was
always
foreseeing
chances
and
using
them
gripping
the
good
and
rejecting
the
dangerous
had
he
not
gripped
the
chance
of
auld
rab
jamieson
barn
there
was
caution
in
that
for
it
was
worth
the
money
whatever
happened
and
there
was
imagination
in
the
whole
scheme
for
he
had
a
vision
of
barbie
as
a
populous
centre
and
streets
of
houses
in
his
holm
and
every
chance
he
seized
led
to
a
better
one
till
almost
every
chance
in
barbie
was
engrossed
by
him
alone
this
is
how
he
went
to
work
note
the
of
his
great
career
when
wilson
was
behind
the
counter
wilson
was
out
distributing
he
was
not
always
out
of
course
his
volume
of
trade
at
first
was
not
big
enough
for
that
but
in
the
mornings
and
the
long
summer
dusks
he
made
his
way
to
the
many
outlying
places
of
which
barbie
was
the
centre
there
in
one
and
the
same
visit
he
distributed
goods
and
collected
orders
for
the
future
though
his
bill
had
spoken
of
carts
as
if
he
had
several
that
was
only
a
bit
of
splurge
on
his
part
his
one
conveyance
at
the
first
was
a
stout
spring
cart
with
a
good
brown
cob
between
the
shafts
but
with
this
he
did
such
a
trade
as
had
never
been
known
in
barbie
the
provost
said
it
was
shtupendous
when
wilson
was
jogging
homeward
in
the
balmy
evenings
of
his
first
summer
at
barbie
no
eye
had
he
for
the
large
evening
star
tremulous
above
the
woods
or
for
the
dreaming
sprays
against
the
yellow
west
it
was
his
business
he
had
other
things
to
mind
yet
wilson
was
a
dreamer
too
his
close
musing
eye
peering
at
the
nodge
of
his
pony
hip
through
the
gloom
saw
not
that
but
visions
of
chances
opportunities
occasions
when
the
lights
of
barbie
twinkled
before
him
in
the
dusk
he
used
to
start
from
a
pleasant
dream
of
some
commercial
enterprise
suggested
by
the
country
round
yon
holm
would
make
a
fine
bleaching
green
pure
water
fine
air
labour
cheap
and
everything
handy
or
the
lintie
linn
among
the
woods
water
power
running
to
waste
yonder
surely
something
could
be
made
of
that
he
would
follow
his
idea
through
all
its
mazes
and
developments
oblivious
of
the
passing
miles
his
delight
in
his
visions
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
author
delight
in
the
figments
of
his
brain
they
were
the
same
good
company
along
the
twilight
roads
the
author
happy
with
his
thronging
thoughts
when
they
are
kind
enough
to
throng
is
no
happier
than
wilson
was
on
nights
like
these
he
had
not
been
a
week
on
his
rounds
when
he
saw
a
chance
waiting
for
development
when
out
delivering
he
used
to
visit
the
upland
farms
to
buy
butter
and
eggs
for
the
emporium
he
got
them
cheaper
so
but
more
eggs
and
butter
could
be
had
than
were
required
in
the
neighbourhood
of
barbie
here
was
a
chance
for
wilson
he
became
a
collector
for
merchants
at
a
distance
barbie
before
it
got
the
railway
had
only
a
silly
little
market
once
a
fortnight
which
was
a
very
poor
outlet
for
stuff
wilson
provided
a
better
one
another
thing
played
into
his
hands
too
in
that
connection
it
is
a
countryside
about
barbie
and
the
less
butter
produced
at
a
place
the
better
for
the
cheese
still
a
good
many
pounds
are
often
churned
on
the
sly
what
need
the
cheese
merchant
ken
it
keepit
the
gudewife
in
bawbees
frae
week
to
week
and
if
she
took
a
little
cream
frae
the
cheese
now
and
than
they
werena
a
pin
the
waur
for
she
aye
did
it
wi
decency
and
caution
still
it
is
as
well
to
dispose
of
this
kind
of
butter
quietly
to
avoid
gabble
among
wilson
slithering
up
the
back
road
with
his
spring
cart
in
the
gloaming
was
the
man
to
dispose
of
it
quietly
and
he
got
it
dirt
cheap
of
course
seeing
it
was
a
kind
of
contraband
all
that
he
made
in
this
way
was
not
much
to
be
sure
threepence
a
dozen
on
the
eggs
perhaps
and
fourpence
on
the
pound
of
butter
still
you
know
every
little
makes
a
mickle
and
hained
gear
helps
weel
and
more
important
than
the
immediate
profit
was
the
ultimate
result
for
wilson
in
this
way
established
with
merchants
in
fechars
and
poltandie
a
connection
for
the
sale
of
country
produce
which
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
in
future
when
he
launched
out
as
in
opposition
to
gourlay
it
occurred
to
him
also
things
were
always
occurring
to
wilson
that
the
scotch
cuddy
business
had
as
fine
a
chance
in
barbie
and
surrounding
neighbourhood
as
ever
it
had
in
north
and
middle
england
the
scotch
cuddy
is
so
called
because
he
is
a
beast
of
burden
and
not
from
the
nature
of
his
wits
he
is
a
travelling
packman
who
infests
communities
of
and
disposes
of
his
goods
on
the
credit
system
receiving
payment
in
instalments
you
go
into
a
house
when
he
is
away
from
home
for
preference
and
laying
a
swatch
of
cloth
across
his
wife
knee
what
do
you
think
of
that
mistress
you
inquire
watching
the
effect
keenly
instantly
all
her
covetous
heart
is
in
her
eye
and
thinks
she
to
herself
oh
but
john
would
look
well
in
that
at
the
kirk
on
sunday
she
has
no
ready
money
and
would
never
have
the
cheek
to
go
into
a
draper
and
order
the
suit
but
when
she
sees
it
lying
there
across
her
knee
she
just
can
not
resist
it
and
fine
you
knew
that
when
you
clinked
it
down
before
her
now
that
the
goods
are
in
the
house
she
can
not
bear
to
let
them
out
the
door
again
but
she
hints
a
scarcity
of
cash
tut
woman
quoth
you
bounteous
and
kind
there
no
obstacle
in
you
can
pay
me
in
instalments
how
much
would
the
instalments
be
she
inquires
oh
a
mere
trifle
half
a
crown
a
week
say
she
hesitates
and
hankers
sunday
coat
getting
quite
shabby
so
it
is
and
tam
macalister
has
a
new
suit
she
was
noticing
the
macalisters
are
always
flaunting
in
their
braws
and
there
that
paisley
shawl
for
herself
too
eh
but
they
would
be
the
canty
pair
cocking
down
the
road
on
sunday
in
rig
they
would
take
the
licht
frae
meg
macalister
een
thae
macalisters
are
always
so
love
vanity
covetousness
present
opportunity
are
all
at
work
upon
the
poor
body
she
succumbs
but
the
weekly
payments
have
a
habit
of
lengthening
themselves
out
till
the
packman
has
made
fifty
per
cent
by
the
business
and
why
not
a
man
must
have
some
interest
on
his
money
then
there
the
risk
of
bad
debts
too
that
falls
to
be
considered
but
there
was
little
risk
of
bad
debts
when
wilson
took
to
for
success
in
that
game
depends
on
pertinacity
in
pursuit
of
your
victim
and
wilson
was
the
man
for
that
he
was
jogging
home
from
brigabee
where
he
had
been
distributing
groceries
at
a
score
of
wee
houses
when
there
flashed
on
his
mind
a
whole
scheme
for
on
a
large
scale
for
mining
villages
were
clustering
in
about
barbie
by
this
time
and
he
saw
his
way
to
a
big
thing
he
was
thinking
of
sandy
toddle
who
had
been
a
scotch
cuddy
in
the
midlands
and
had
retired
to
barbie
on
a
snug
bit
fortune
he
was
thinking
of
sandy
when
the
plan
rose
generous
on
his
mind
he
would
soon
have
more
horses
than
one
on
the
road
why
should
they
carry
swatches
of
cloth
as
well
as
groceries
if
he
had
responsible
men
under
him
it
would
be
their
own
interest
for
a
small
commission
on
the
profits
to
see
that
payments
were
levied
correctly
every
week
and
those
colliers
were
reckless
with
their
cash
far
readier
to
commit
themselves
to
buying
than
the
cannier
country
bodies
round
lord
there
was
money
in
the
scheme
no
sooner
thought
of
than
put
in
practice
wilson
gave
up
the
after
five
or
six
years
he
had
other
fish
to
fry
by
that
time
but
while
he
was
at
it
he
made
money
hand
over
fist
at
the
job
but
what
boots
it
to
tell
of
all
his
schemes
he
had
the
lucky
eye
and
everything
he
looked
on
prospered
before
he
had
been
a
week
in
barbie
he
met
gourlay
just
at
the
bend
the
brae
in
full
presence
of
the
bodies
remembering
their
first
encounter
the
grocer
tried
to
outstare
him
but
gourlay
hardened
his
glower
and
the
grocer
blinked
when
the
two
passed
i
declare
said
the
bodies
did
ye
see
yon
they
not
on
speaking
terms
and
they
hotched
with
glee
to
think
that
gourlay
had
another
enemy
judge
of
their
delight
when
they
saw
one
day
about
a
month
later
just
as
gourlay
was
passing
up
the
street
wilson
come
down
it
with
a
load
of
coals
for
a
customer
for
he
was
often
out
auchterwheeze
road
in
the
early
morning
and
what
was
the
use
of
an
empty
journey
back
again
especially
as
he
had
plenty
of
time
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
attend
to
other
folk
affairs
so
here
he
was
started
as
a
carrier
in
full
opposition
to
gourlay
did
you
see
gourlay
face
chuckled
the
bodies
when
the
cart
went
by
yon
was
a
bash
in
the
eye
to
him
ha
ha
he
not
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
now
wilson
had
slid
into
the
carrying
in
the
natural
development
of
business
it
was
another
of
the
possibilities
which
he
saw
and
turned
to
his
advantage
the
two
other
chief
grocers
in
the
place
cunningham
the
dirty
and
calderwood
the
drunken
having
no
carts
or
horses
of
their
own
were
dependent
on
gourlay
for
conveyance
of
their
goods
from
skeighan
but
wilson
brought
his
own
naturally
he
was
asked
by
his
customers
to
bring
a
parcel
now
and
then
and
naturally
being
the
man
he
was
he
made
them
pay
for
the
privilege
with
that
for
a
start
the
rest
was
soon
accomplished
gourlay
had
to
pay
now
for
his
years
of
insolence
and
tyranny
all
who
had
irked
beneath
his
domineering
ways
got
their
carrying
done
by
wilson
ere
long
that
prosperous
gentleman
had
three
carts
on
the
road
and
two
men
under
him
to
help
in
his
various
affairs
carting
was
only
one
of
several
new
developments
in
the
business
of
when
the
navvies
came
in
about
the
town
and
accommodation
was
ill
to
find
wilson
rigged
up
an
old
shed
in
the
corner
of
his
holm
as
a
hostelry
for
ten
of
them
and
they
had
to
pay
through
the
nose
for
their
night
lodging
their
food
they
obtained
from
the
emporium
and
thus
the
wilsons
bled
them
both
ways
then
there
was
the
scheme
for
supplying
milk
another
of
the
possibeelities
hitherto
in
winter
barbie
was
dependent
for
its
milk
supply
on
heavy
that
came
lumbering
down
the
street
about
seven
in
the
morning
jangling
bells
to
waken
sleepy
customers
and
carrying
lanterns
that
carved
circles
of
fairy
yellow
out
the
raw
air
but
wilson
got
four
cows
who
would
be
milking
strong
in
december
and
supplied
milk
to
all
the
folk
about
the
cross
she
had
a
lass
to
help
her
in
the
house
now
and
the
boy
was
always
to
be
seen
jinking
round
corners
like
a
weasel
running
messages
errand
boy
to
the
bisness
in
general
yet
though
everybody
was
busy
and
skelping
at
it
such
a
stress
of
work
was
accompanied
with
much
disarray
wilson
yard
was
the
strangest
contrast
to
gourlay
gourlay
was
a
pleasure
to
the
eye
everything
of
the
best
and
everything
in
order
since
the
master
pride
would
not
allow
it
to
be
other
but
though
wilson
emporium
was
clean
his
back
yard
was
littered
with
dirty
straw
broken
boxes
old
barrels
stable
refuse
and
the
shafts
of
carts
uptilted
in
between
when
boxes
and
barrels
were
flung
out
of
the
emporium
they
were
generally
allowed
to
lie
on
the
dunghill
until
they
were
converted
into
firewood
mistress
you
a
trifle
mixed
said
the
provost
in
grave
reproof
when
he
went
round
to
the
back
to
see
wilson
on
a
matter
of
business
but
tut
cried
wilson
as
she
threw
down
a
plank
to
make
a
path
for
him
across
a
dub
tut
she
laughed
the
clartier
the
cosier
and
it
was
as
true
as
she
said
it
the
thing
went
forward
splendidly
in
spite
of
its
confusion
though
trade
was
brisker
in
barbie
than
it
had
ever
been
before
wilson
had
already
done
injury
to
gourlay
business
as
general
conveyor
but
hitherto
he
had
not
infringed
on
the
gurly
one
other
monopolies
his
chance
came
at
last
he
appeared
on
a
in
front
of
the
red
lion
a
piece
of
pinky
brown
paper
in
his
hand
that
was
the
first
telegram
ever
seen
in
barbie
and
it
had
been
brought
by
special
messenger
from
skeighan
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
it
ran
will
buy
stone
cheese
shillings
stone
delivery
at
once
and
was
signed
by
a
merchant
in
poltandie
gourlay
was
talking
to
old
tarmillan
of
irrendavie
when
wilson
pushed
in
and
addressed
tarmillan
without
a
glance
at
the
have
you
a
kane
o
cheese
to
sell
irrendavie
was
his
blithe
salutation
i
have
said
irrendavie
and
he
eyed
him
suspiciously
for
what
was
wilson
speiring
for
wasna
a
how
much
the
stane
are
ye
seeking
said
wilson
i
have
just
been
asking
gourlay
here
for
said
irrendavie
but
he
winna
rise
a
penny
on
the
seven
ye
said
wilson
and
slapped
his
long
thin
flexible
far
too
ostentatiously
against
the
knuckles
of
his
left
hand
but
but
stammered
irrendavie
suspicious
still
but
melting
at
the
offer
have
no
means
of
storing
cheese
oh
said
wilson
getting
in
a
fine
one
at
gourlay
there
no
drawback
in
that
the
ways
o
business
have
changed
greatly
since
steam
came
close
to
our
doors
it
nothing
but
vanity
nowadays
when
a
country
merchant
wastes
money
on
a
ramshackle
of
buildings
for
storing
no
need
for
that
if
he
only
had
brains
to
develop
quick
deliveries
some
folk
no
doubt
like
to
build
monuments
to
their
own
pride
but
i
not
one
of
that
kind
there
not
enough
sense
in
that
to
satisfy
a
man
like
me
my
offer
doesna
hold
you
understand
unless
you
deliver
the
cheese
at
skeighan
station
do
you
accept
the
condition
oh
yes
said
irrendavie
i
willing
to
agree
to
that
into
the
red
lion
then
said
wilson
and
we
wet
the
bargain
with
a
drink
to
make
it
hold
the
tighter
then
a
strange
thing
happened
gourlay
had
a
curious
stick
of
foreign
wood
one
of
the
trifles
he
fed
his
pride
on
the
crook
of
which
curved
back
to
the
stem
and
inhered
leaving
space
only
for
the
fingers
the
wood
was
of
wonderful
toughness
and
gourlay
had
been
known
to
bet
that
no
man
could
break
the
handle
of
his
stick
by
a
single
grip
over
the
crook
and
under
it
yet
now
as
he
saw
his
bargain
whisked
away
from
him
and
listened
to
wilson
jibe
the
thing
snapped
in
his
grip
like
a
rotten
twig
he
stared
down
at
the
broken
pieces
for
a
while
as
if
wondering
how
they
came
there
then
dashed
them
on
the
ground
while
wilson
stood
smiling
by
and
then
he
strode
with
a
look
on
his
face
that
made
the
folk
fall
away
he
hellish
angry
they
grinned
to
each
other
when
their
foe
was
gone
and
laughed
when
they
heard
the
cause
of
it
ha
ha
wilson
the
boy
to
diddle
him
and
yet
they
looked
queer
when
told
that
the
famous
stick
had
snapped
in
his
grasp
like
a
lord
cried
the
baker
in
admiring
awe
did
he
break
it
with
the
ae
chirt
it
been
tried
by
scores
of
fellows
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
never
a
man
of
them
was
up
lads
there
something
splendid
about
gourlay
wrath
what
a
man
he
is
when
the
grups
him
thplendid
d
said
the
deacon
he
may
thwing
in
a
towe
for
his
thplendid
wrath
yet
from
that
day
wilson
and
gourlay
were
a
pair
of
gladiators
for
whom
the
people
of
barbie
made
a
ring
they
pitted
the
protagonists
against
each
other
and
hounded
them
on
to
rivalry
by
their
comments
and
remarks
taking
the
side
of
the
newcomer
less
from
partiality
to
him
than
from
hatred
of
their
ancient
enemy
it
was
strange
that
a
thing
so
impalpable
as
gossip
should
influence
so
strong
a
man
as
john
gourlay
to
his
ruin
but
it
did
the
bodies
of
barbie
became
not
only
the
chorus
to
tragedy
buzzing
it
abroad
and
discussing
his
downfall
they
became
also
merely
by
their
maddening
tattle
a
villain
of
the
piece
and
an
active
cause
of
the
catastrophe
their
gossip
seemed
to
materialize
into
a
single
entity
a
something
propelling
that
spurred
gourlay
on
to
the
schemes
that
ruined
him
he
was
not
to
be
done
he
said
he
would
show
the
dogs
what
he
thought
of
them
and
so
he
plunged
headlong
while
the
wary
wilson
watched
him
smiling
at
the
sight
there
was
a
pretty
brewing
in
the
little
town
footnotes
saved
money
that
is
for
the
stone
of
fourteen
pounds
at
that
time
scotch
cheese
was
selling
at
from
fifty
to
sixty
shillings
the
chapter
xii
ay
man
templandmuir
it
you
said
gourlay
coming
forward
with
great
heartiness
ay
man
and
how
are
ye
into
the
parlour
gourlay
said
the
templar
his
manner
was
curiously
subdued
since
his
marriage
there
was
a
great
change
in
the
rubicund
squireen
hitherto
he
had
lived
in
sluttish
comfort
on
his
own
land
content
with
the
little
it
brought
in
and
proud
to
be
the
friend
of
gourlay
whom
everybody
feared
if
it
ever
dawned
on
his
befuddled
mind
that
gourlay
turned
the
friendship
to
his
own
account
his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
prestige
he
acquired
because
of
it
like
many
another
robustious
big
toper
the
templar
was
a
chicken
at
heart
and
to
be
in
with
gourlay
lent
him
a
consequence
that
covered
his
deficiency
yes
i
sleepy
he
would
yawn
in
skeighan
mart
i
had
a
sederunt
yestreen
wi
john
gourlay
and
he
would
slap
his
boot
with
his
and
feel
like
a
hero
i
know
how
it
is
i
know
how
it
is
provost
connal
of
barbie
used
to
cry
gourlay
both
courts
and
cowes
him
first
he
courts
and
then
he
cowes
and
the
templar
has
the
courage
to
break
it
off
the
provost
hit
the
mark
but
when
the
templar
married
the
miller
daughter
of
the
mill
o
blink
a
sad
said
foolish
neighbours
for
a
halliday
of
templandmuir
there
was
a
sudden
change
about
the
laird
in
our
good
scots
proverb
a
miller
daughter
has
a
shrill
voice
and
the
new
leddy
of
templandmuir
a
leddy
she
is
said
the
frightened
housekeeper
justified
the
proverb
her
voice
went
with
the
skirl
of
an
east
wind
through
the
mansion
of
the
hallidays
she
was
and
a
birkie
woman
of
can
make
a
good
husband
out
of
very
unpromising
material
the
templar
wore
a
scared
look
in
those
days
and
went
home
betimes
his
cronies
knew
the
fun
was
over
when
they
heard
what
happened
to
the
great
punchbowl
she
made
it
a
it
was
the
heirloom
of
a
hundred
years
and
as
much
as
a
man
could
carry
with
his
arms
out
a
massive
curio
in
stone
but
to
her
husband
plaint
about
its
degradation
oh
she
cried
it
never
know
the
difference
it
been
used
to
swine
but
she
was
not
content
with
the
cessation
of
the
old
she
was
determined
on
bringing
in
the
new
for
a
twelvemonth
now
she
had
urged
her
husband
to
be
rid
of
gourlay
the
country
was
opening
up
she
said
and
the
quarry
ought
to
be
their
own
a
dozen
times
he
had
promised
her
to
warn
gourlay
that
he
must
yield
the
quarry
when
his
tack
ran
out
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
a
dozen
times
he
had
shrunk
from
the
encounter
i
write
he
said
feebly
write
said
she
lowered
in
her
pride
to
think
her
husband
was
a
coward
write
indeed
man
have
ye
no
spunk
think
what
he
has
made
out
o
ye
think
o
the
money
that
has
gone
to
him
that
should
have
come
to
you
you
should
be
glad
o
the
chance
to
tell
him
my
certy
if
i
was
you
i
would
miss
it
for
the
world
just
to
let
him
know
of
his
cheatry
oh
it
very
right
that
she
sounded
the
big
and
brave
it
very
right
that
should
live
in
this
tumbledown
hole
while
builds
a
palace
from
your
plunder
it
right
that
should
put
up
with
this
she
flung
hands
of
contempt
at
her
dwelling
right
that
should
put
up
with
this
while
yon
trollop
has
a
splendid
mansion
on
the
top
o
the
brae
and
every
bawbee
of
his
fortune
has
come
out
of
you
the
fool
makes
nothing
from
his
other
business
he
would
have
been
a
pauper
if
he
had
met
a
softie
like
you
that
he
could
do
what
he
liked
with
write
indeed
i
have
no
patience
with
a
wheen
sumphs
of
men
them
do
the
work
o
the
world
they
may
wear
the
breeks
but
the
women
wear
the
brains
i
trow
i
have
it
out
with
the
black
brute
myself
screamed
the
hardy
dame
if
you
feared
of
his
glower
if
you
havena
the
pluck
for
it
have
write
indeed
in
you
go
to
the
meeting
that
oald
ass
of
a
provost
has
convened
and
show
your
face
in
templandmuir
till
you
have
had
it
out
with
gourlay
no
wonder
the
templar
looked
subdued
when
gourlay
came
forward
with
his
usual
calculated
heartiness
the
laird
remembered
his
wife
and
felt
very
uncomfortable
it
was
ill
to
round
on
a
man
who
always
imposed
on
him
a
hearty
and
hardy
gourlay
greeting
him
so
warmly
gave
him
no
excuse
for
an
outburst
in
his
dilemma
he
turned
to
the
children
to
postpone
the
evil
hour
ay
man
john
he
said
heavily
you
there
heavy
scotsmen
are
fond
of
telling
folk
that
they
are
where
they
are
you
there
said
templandmuir
ay
said
john
the
simpleton
i
here
in
the
grime
of
the
boy
face
there
were
large
white
circles
round
the
eyes
showing
where
his
fists
had
rubbed
off
the
tears
through
the
day
how
are
you
doing
at
the
school
said
the
templar
oh
he
an
ass
said
gourlay
he
takes
after
his
mother
in
that
the
lassie
more
smart
she
favours
our
side
o
the
house
eh
jenny
he
inquired
and
tugged
her
pigtail
smiling
down
at
her
in
grim
fondness
yes
nodded
janet
encouraged
by
the
petting
john
always
at
the
bottom
of
the
class
jimmy
wilson
always
at
the
top
and
the
dominie
set
him
to
teach
john
his
the
day
after
he
had
thrashed
him
she
cried
out
at
a
sudden
tug
on
her
pigtail
and
looked
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
meet
her
father
scowl
you
eediot
said
gourlay
gazing
at
his
son
with
a
savage
contempt
have
you
no
pride
to
let
wilson
son
be
your
master
john
slunk
from
the
room
bide
where
you
are
templandmuir
said
gourlay
after
a
little
be
back
directly
he
went
through
to
the
kitchen
and
took
a
crystal
jug
from
the
dresser
he
made
a
point
of
bringing
the
water
for
his
whisky
i
like
to
pump
it
up
he
used
to
say
cold
and
cold
ye
know
till
there
a
mist
on
the
outside
of
the
glass
like
the
bloom
on
a
plum
and
then
by
goad
ye
have
the
fine
drinking
oh
no
ye
need
tell
me
i
lip
drink
if
the
water
wasna
he
never
varied
from
the
tipple
he
approved
in
his
long
sederunts
with
templandmuir
he
would
slip
out
to
the
pump
before
every
brew
to
get
water
of
sufficient
coldness
he
would
birl
the
bottle
with
templandmuir
as
usual
till
the
fuddled
laird
should
think
himself
a
fine
big
fellow
as
being
the
intimate
of
john
gourlay
and
then
sober
as
a
judge
himself
he
would
drive
him
home
in
the
small
hours
and
when
next
they
met
the
squireen
would
chuckle
proudly
faith
yon
was
a
night
by
a
crude
cunning
of
the
kind
gourlay
had
maintained
his
ascendancy
for
years
and
he
would
maintain
it
still
he
went
out
to
the
pump
to
fetch
water
with
his
own
hands
for
their
first
libation
but
when
he
came
back
and
set
out
the
big
decanter
templandmuir
started
to
his
feet
noat
gourlay
he
stammered
and
his
unusual
flutter
of
refusal
might
have
warned
gourlay
noat
if
please
noat
if
please
as
a
matter
of
fact
eh
what
i
really
came
into
the
town
for
doa
you
see
was
eh
to
attend
the
meeting
the
provost
has
convened
about
the
railway
you
come
down
to
the
meeting
will
ye
noat
he
wanted
to
get
gourlay
away
from
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
it
would
be
easier
to
quarrel
with
him
out
of
doors
but
gourlay
gaped
at
him
across
the
table
his
eyes
big
with
surprise
and
disapproval
huh
he
growled
i
wonder
at
a
man
like
you
giving
your
head
to
that
it
a
wheen
damned
nonsense
oh
i
no
so
sure
of
that
drawled
the
templar
i
think
the
railway
means
to
come
the
whole
country
was
agog
about
the
new
railway
the
question
agitating
solemn
minds
was
whether
it
should
join
the
main
line
at
fechars
thirty
miles
ahead
or
pass
to
the
right
through
fleckie
and
barbie
to
a
junction
up
at
skeighan
drone
many
were
the
reasons
spluttered
in
vehement
debate
for
one
route
or
the
other
on
the
one
side
ye
see
skeighan
was
a
big
place
and
look
what
a
centre
it
would
be
if
it
had
three
lines
of
rail
running
out
and
in
eh
my
what
a
centre
then
there
was
fleckie
and
barbie
they
would
be
the
big
towns
up
the
valley
too
was
the
shortest
road
it
would
be
a
thing
to
build
thirty
mile
of
rail
when
fifteen
was
enough
to
establish
the
connection
and
was
it
likely
i
put
it
to
ainy
man
of
sense
was
it
likely
the
coal
company
would
do
everything
in
their
power
to
get
the
railway
up
the
valley
seeing
that
if
it
did
come
that
airt
they
would
need
to
build
a
line
of
their
own
ah
but
then
ye
see
fechars
was
a
big
place
too
and
there
was
lots
of
mineral
up
there
as
well
and
though
it
was
a
longer
road
to
fechars
and
part
of
it
lay
across
the
moors
there
were
several
wee
towns
that
airt
just
waiting
for
a
chance
of
growth
i
can
tell
ye
sirs
this
was
going
to
be
a
close
question
such
was
the
talk
in
and
parlour
at
kirk
and
mart
and
tryst
and
fair
and
wherever
potentates
did
gather
and
abound
the
partisans
on
either
side
began
to
canvass
the
country
in
support
of
their
contentions
they
might
have
kept
their
breath
to
cool
their
porridge
for
these
matters
we
know
are
settled
in
the
great
witenagemot
but
petitions
were
prepared
and
meetings
were
convened
in
those
days
provost
connal
of
barbie
was
in
constant
communion
with
the
yass
he
nodded
gravely
only
nod
is
a
word
too
swift
for
the
grave
inclining
of
that
mighty
pow
yass
ye
know
the
great
thing
in
matters
like
this
is
to
get
at
the
doa
you
see
oh
yass
yass
we
must
get
at
the
and
he
looked
as
if
none
but
he
were
equal
to
the
job
he
even
went
to
london
to
interrogate
the
and
simple
bodies
gathered
at
the
cross
for
their
saturday
at
told
each
other
with
bated
breath
that
the
provost
was
away
to
the
seat
of
to
see
about
the
railway
when
he
came
back
and
shook
his
head
hope
drained
from
his
fellows
and
left
them
hollow
in
an
empty
world
but
when
he
smacked
his
lips
on
receiving
an
important
letter
the
heavens
were
brightened
and
the
landscapes
smiled
the
provost
walked
about
the
town
nowadays
with
the
air
of
a
man
on
whose
shoulders
the
weight
of
empires
did
depend
but
for
all
his
airs
it
was
not
the
head
o
the
town
who
was
the
ablest
advocate
of
the
route
up
the
water
of
barbie
it
was
that
citizen
james
wilson
of
the
cross
wilson
championed
the
cause
of
barbie
with
an
ardour
that
did
infinite
credit
to
his
civic
heart
for
one
thing
it
was
a
grand
way
of
recommending
himself
to
his
new
townsfolk
as
he
told
his
wife
and
so
increasing
the
circle
of
our
present
trade
do
ye
understand
for
another
he
was
as
keen
as
the
keenest
that
the
railway
should
come
and
enhance
the
value
of
his
property
we
must
agitate
he
cried
when
sandy
toddle
murmured
a
doubt
whether
anything
they
could
do
would
be
of
much
avail
it
not
settled
yet
what
road
the
line
to
follow
and
who
knows
but
a
trifle
may
turn
the
scale
in
our
behalf
local
opinion
ought
to
be
expressed
they
sending
a
monster
petition
from
the
fechars
side
we
send
the
company
a
bigger
one
from
ours
look
at
skeighan
and
fleckie
and
barbie
three
towns
at
our
back
and
the
new
coal
company
forbye
a
public
opinion
of
that
size
ought
to
have
a
great
weight
if
put
forward
properly
we
must
agitate
sirs
we
must
agitate
we
maun
scour
the
country
for
names
in
our
support
look
what
a
number
of
things
there
are
to
recommend
route
it
the
shortest
and
there
no
need
for
heavy
cuttings
such
as
are
needed
on
the
other
side
the
road
there
barbie
water
has
cut
it
through
the
hills
it
the
manifest
design
of
providence
that
there
should
be
a
line
up
barbie
valley
what
a
position
and
oh
thought
wilson
what
a
site
for
building
houses
in
my
holm
let
a
meeting
be
convened
at
wunst
the
meeting
was
convened
with
provost
connal
in
the
chair
and
wilson
as
general
factotum
you
come
down
to
the
meeting
said
templandmuir
to
gourlay
go
to
a
meeting
for
which
wilson
had
sent
out
the
bills
at
another
gourlay
would
have
hurled
his
usual
objurgation
that
he
would
see
him
condemned
to
eternal
agonies
ere
he
granted
his
request
but
templandmuir
was
different
gourlay
had
always
flattered
this
man
whom
he
inwardly
despised
by
a
companionship
which
made
proud
the
other
he
had
always
yielded
to
templandmuir
in
small
things
for
the
sake
of
the
quarry
which
was
a
great
thing
he
yielded
to
him
now
verra
well
he
said
shortly
and
rose
to
get
his
hat
when
gourlay
put
on
his
hat
the
shallow
meanness
of
his
brow
was
hid
and
nothing
was
seen
to
impair
his
dark
strong
gravity
of
face
he
was
a
man
you
would
have
turned
to
look
at
as
he
marched
in
silence
by
the
side
of
templandmuir
though
taller
than
the
laird
he
looked
shorter
because
of
his
enormous
breadth
he
had
a
chest
like
the
heave
of
a
hill
templandmuir
was
afraid
of
him
and
fretting
at
the
necessity
he
felt
to
quarrel
with
a
man
of
whom
he
was
afraid
he
had
an
unreasonable
hatred
of
gourlay
whose
conduct
made
this
quarrel
necessary
at
the
same
time
that
his
character
made
it
to
be
feared
and
he
brooded
on
his
growing
rage
that
with
it
for
a
stimulus
he
might
work
his
cowardly
nature
to
the
point
of
quarrelling
conscious
of
the
coming
row
then
he
felt
awkward
in
the
present
and
was
ignorant
what
to
say
gourlay
was
silent
too
he
felt
it
an
insult
to
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
that
the
laird
should
refuse
its
proffered
hospitality
he
hated
to
be
dragged
to
a
meeting
he
despised
never
before
was
such
irritation
between
them
when
they
came
to
the
hall
where
the
meeting
was
convened
there
were
knots
of
bodies
grouped
about
the
floor
wilson
fluttered
from
group
to
group
an
important
man
with
a
roll
of
papers
in
his
hand
gourlay
quick
for
once
in
his
dislike
took
in
every
feature
of
the
man
he
loathed
wilson
was
what
the
sentimental
women
of
the
neighbourhood
called
a
bonny
man
his
features
were
remarkably
regular
and
his
complexion
was
remarkably
fair
his
brow
was
so
delicate
of
hue
that
the
blue
veins
running
down
his
temples
could
be
traced
distinctly
beneath
the
whiteness
of
the
skin
unluckily
for
him
he
was
so
fair
that
in
a
strong
light
as
now
beneath
the
gas
the
suspicion
of
his
unwashedness
became
a
certainty
as
if
he
got
a
bit
idle
slaik
now
and
than
and
never
a
good
rub
thought
gourlay
in
a
clean
disgust
full
lips
showed
themselves
bright
red
in
the
middle
between
the
two
wings
of
a
very
blonde
and
very
symmetrical
moustache
the
ugly
feature
of
the
face
was
the
blue
calculating
eyes
they
were
tender
round
the
lids
so
that
the
white
lashes
stuck
out
in
little
peaks
and
in
conversation
he
had
a
habit
of
peering
out
of
these
eyes
as
if
he
were
constantly
spying
for
something
to
emerge
that
he
might
twist
to
his
advantage
as
he
talked
to
a
man
close
by
and
glimmered
not
at
the
man
beside
him
but
far
away
in
the
distance
of
his
mind
at
some
chance
of
gain
suggested
by
the
other
words
gourlay
heard
him
say
musingly
imphm
imphm
imphm
there
might
be
something
that
nodding
his
head
and
stroking
his
moustache
as
he
uttered
each
meditative
imphm
it
was
wilson
unconscious
revelation
that
his
mind
was
busy
with
a
commercial
hint
which
he
had
stolen
from
his
neighbour
talk
the
damned
thought
gourlay
enlightened
by
his
hate
sucking
tam
finlay
brains
to
steal
some
idea
for
himsell
and
still
as
wilson
listened
he
murmured
swiftly
imphm
i
see
finlay
imphm
imphm
imphm
nodding
his
head
and
pulling
his
moustache
and
glimmering
at
his
new
opportunity
our
insight
is
often
deepest
into
those
we
hate
because
annoyance
fixes
our
thought
on
them
to
probe
we
can
not
keep
our
minds
off
them
why
do
they
do
it
we
snarl
and
wondering
why
we
find
out
their
character
gourlay
was
not
an
observant
man
but
every
man
is
in
any
man
somewhere
and
hate
driving
his
mind
into
wilson
helped
him
to
read
him
like
an
open
book
he
recognized
with
a
vague
uneasiness
not
with
fear
for
gourlay
did
not
know
what
it
meant
but
with
uneasy
anger
the
superior
cunning
of
his
rival
gourlay
a
strong
block
of
a
man
cut
off
from
the
world
by
impotence
of
speech
could
never
have
got
out
of
finlay
what
wilson
drew
from
him
in
two
minutes
easy
conversation
wilson
ignored
gourlay
but
he
was
very
blithe
with
templandmuir
and
inveigled
him
off
to
a
corner
they
talked
together
very
briskly
and
wilson
laughed
once
with
uplifted
head
glancing
across
at
gourlay
as
he
laughed
curse
them
were
they
speaking
of
him
the
hall
was
crammed
at
last
and
the
important
bodies
took
their
seats
upon
the
front
benches
gourlay
refused
to
be
seated
with
the
rest
but
stood
near
the
platform
with
his
back
to
the
wall
by
the
side
of
templandmuir
after
what
the
provost
described
as
a
few
preliminary
remarks
they
lasted
half
an
hour
he
called
on
wilson
to
address
the
meeting
wilson
descanted
on
the
benefits
that
would
accrue
to
barbie
if
it
got
the
railway
and
on
the
needcessity
for
a
long
pull
and
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
a
phrase
which
he
repeated
many
times
in
the
course
of
his
address
he
sat
down
at
last
amid
thunders
of
applause
there
no
needcessity
for
me
to
make
a
loang
speech
said
the
provost
hear
hear
said
gourlay
and
the
meeting
was
unkind
enough
to
laugh
order
order
cried
wilson
perkily
as
i
was
saying
when
i
was
grossly
interrupted
fumed
the
provost
there
no
needcessity
for
me
to
make
a
loang
speech
i
had
thoat
we
were
agreed
on
the
desirabeelity
of
the
rileway
coming
in
our
direction
i
had
thoat
after
the
able
i
must
say
the
very
able
speech
of
wilson
that
there
was
a
man
in
this
room
so
shtupid
as
to
utter
a
word
of
dishapproval
i
had
thoat
we
might
prosheed
at
woance
to
elect
a
deputation
i
had
thoat
we
would
get
the
name
of
everybody
here
for
the
great
petition
we
mean
to
send
the
i
had
thoat
it
was
all
so
to
shpeak
a
foregone
conclusion
but
it
seems
i
was
mistaken
ladies
and
gentlemen
or
rather
i
oat
to
say
gentlemen
for
i
believe
there
are
no
ladies
present
yass
it
seems
i
was
mistaken
it
may
be
there
are
some
who
would
like
to
keep
barbie
going
on
in
the
oald
way
which
they
found
so
much
to
their
advantage
it
may
be
there
are
some
who
regret
a
change
that
will
put
an
end
to
their
chances
of
tyraneezin
it
may
be
there
are
some
who
know
themselves
so
shtupid
that
they
fear
the
new
condeetions
of
trade
the
railway
bound
to
bring
here
wilson
rose
and
whispered
in
his
ear
and
the
people
watched
them
wondering
what
hint
was
passing
to
the
provost
the
provost
leaned
with
pompous
gravity
toward
his
monitor
hand
at
ear
to
catch
the
treasured
words
he
nodded
and
now
gentlemen
as
wilson
said
this
is
a
case
that
needs
a
loang
pull
and
a
stroang
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
we
must
be
unanimous
it
will
do
to
show
ourselves
divided
among
ourselves
therefore
i
think
we
oat
to
have
expressions
of
opinion
from
some
of
our
leading
townsmen
that
will
show
how
far
we
are
unanimous
i
had
thoat
there
could
be
only
one
opinion
and
that
we
might
prosheed
at
once
with
the
petition
but
it
seems
i
was
wroang
it
is
best
to
inquire
first
exactly
where
we
stand
so
i
call
upon
john
gourlay
who
has
been
the
foremost
man
in
the
town
for
mainy
years
at
least
he
used
to
be
that
i
call
upon
gourlay
as
the
first
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subjeck
wilson
hint
to
the
provost
placed
gourlay
in
a
fine
dilemma
stupid
as
he
was
he
was
not
so
stupid
as
not
to
perceive
the
general
advantage
of
the
railway
if
he
approved
it
however
he
would
seem
to
support
wilson
and
the
provost
whom
he
loathed
if
he
disapproved
his
opposition
would
be
set
down
to
a
selfish
consideration
for
his
own
trade
and
he
would
incur
the
anger
of
the
meeting
which
was
all
for
the
coming
of
the
railway
wilson
had
seized
the
chance
to
put
him
in
a
false
position
he
knew
gourlay
could
not
put
forty
words
together
in
public
and
that
in
his
dilemma
he
would
blunder
and
give
himself
away
gourlay
evaded
the
question
it
would
be
better
to
convene
a
meeting
he
bawled
to
the
provost
to
consider
the
state
of
some
folk
back
doors
that
was
a
nipper
to
wilson
there
a
stink
at
the
cross
that
enough
to
kill
a
cuddy
evidently
not
yelled
wilson
since
you
still
alive
a
roar
went
up
against
gourlay
all
he
could
do
was
to
scowl
before
him
with
mouth
and
gleaming
eyes
while
they
bellowed
him
to
scorn
i
would
like
to
hear
what
templandmuir
has
to
say
on
the
subject
said
wilson
getting
up
but
no
doubt
he
follow
his
friend
mr
gourlay
no
i
do
follow
gourlay
bawled
templandmuir
with
unnecessary
loudness
the
reason
of
his
vehemence
was
twofold
he
was
nettled
as
wilson
meant
he
should
by
the
suggestion
that
he
was
nothing
but
gourlay
henchman
and
being
eager
to
oppose
gourlay
yet
a
coward
he
yelled
to
supply
in
noise
what
he
lacked
in
resolution
i
do
follow
gourlay
at
all
he
roared
i
follow
nobody
but
myself
every
man
in
the
district
in
support
of
this
petition
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
anything
else
i
be
glad
to
sig
among
the
first
and
do
everything
i
can
in
its
support
verra
well
said
the
provost
it
seems
we
agreed
after
all
get
some
of
our
foremost
men
to
sign
the
petition
at
this
end
of
the
hall
and
then
it
be
placed
in
the
anteroom
for
the
rest
to
sign
as
they
go
out
take
it
across
to
gourlay
whispered
wilson
to
the
two
men
who
were
carrying
the
enormous
tome
they
took
it
over
to
the
grain
merchant
and
one
of
them
handed
him
an
inkhorn
he
dashed
it
to
the
ground
the
meeting
hissed
like
a
cellarful
of
snakes
but
gourlay
turned
and
glowered
at
them
and
somehow
the
hisses
died
away
his
was
the
high
courage
that
feeds
on
hate
and
welcomes
rather
than
shrinks
from
its
expression
he
was
smiling
as
he
faced
them
let
pass
he
said
and
shouldered
his
way
to
the
door
the
bystanders
falling
back
to
make
room
templandmuir
followed
him
out
i
walk
to
the
head
o
the
brae
said
the
templar
he
must
have
it
out
with
gourlay
at
once
or
else
go
home
to
meet
the
anger
of
his
wife
having
opposed
gourlay
already
he
felt
that
now
was
the
time
to
break
with
him
for
good
only
a
little
was
needed
to
complete
the
rupture
and
he
was
the
more
impelled
to
declare
himself
because
he
had
just
seen
gourlay
discomfited
and
was
beginning
to
despise
the
man
he
had
formerly
admired
why
the
whole
meeting
had
laughed
at
his
expense
in
quarrelling
with
gourlay
moreover
he
would
have
the
whole
locality
behind
him
he
would
range
himself
on
the
popular
side
every
impulse
of
mind
and
body
pushed
him
forward
to
the
brink
of
speech
he
would
never
get
a
better
occasion
to
bring
out
his
grievance
they
trudged
together
in
a
burning
silence
though
nothing
was
said
between
them
each
was
in
wrathful
contact
with
the
other
mind
gourlay
blamed
everything
that
had
happened
on
templandmuir
who
had
dragged
him
to
the
meeting
and
deserted
him
and
templandmuir
was
longing
to
begin
about
the
quarry
but
afraid
to
start
that
was
why
he
began
at
last
with
false
unnecessary
loudness
it
was
partly
to
encourage
himself
as
a
bull
bellows
to
increase
his
rage
and
partly
because
his
spite
had
been
so
long
controlled
it
burst
the
louder
for
its
pent
fury
mr
gourlay
he
bawled
suddenly
when
they
came
opposite
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
i
had
a
crow
to
pick
with
you
for
more
than
a
year
it
came
on
gourlay
with
a
flash
that
templandmuir
was
slipping
away
from
him
but
he
must
answer
him
civilly
for
the
sake
of
the
quarry
ay
man
he
said
quietly
and
what
may
that
be
i
damned
soon
tell
you
what
it
is
said
the
templar
yon
was
a
monstrous
overcharge
for
bringing
my
ironwork
from
fleckie
i
be
damned
if
i
put
up
with
that
and
yet
it
was
only
a
trifle
he
had
put
up
with
fifty
worse
impositions
and
never
said
a
word
but
when
a
man
is
bent
on
a
quarrel
any
spark
will
do
for
an
explosion
how
do
ye
make
that
out
said
gourlay
still
very
quietly
lest
he
should
alienate
the
quarry
laird
damned
fine
do
i
make
that
out
yelled
templandmuir
and
louder
than
ever
was
the
yell
he
was
the
brave
man
now
with
his
bellow
to
hearten
him
damned
fine
do
i
make
that
out
you
charged
me
for
a
whole
day
though
half
was
spent
upon
your
own
concerns
i
tired
o
you
and
your
cheatry
you
made
a
braw
penny
out
o
me
in
your
time
but
curse
me
if
i
endure
it
loanger
i
give
you
notice
this
verra
night
that
your
tack
o
the
quarry
must
end
at
martinmas
he
was
off
glad
to
have
it
out
and
glad
to
escape
the
consequence
leaving
gourlay
a
cauldron
of
wrath
in
the
darkness
it
was
not
merely
the
material
loss
that
maddened
him
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
taken
a
rebuff
without
a
word
or
a
blow
in
return
in
his
desire
to
conciliate
he
had
let
templandmuir
get
away
unscathed
his
blood
rocked
him
where
he
stood
he
walked
blindly
to
the
kitchen
door
never
knowing
how
he
reached
it
it
was
locked
at
this
early
hour
and
the
simple
inconvenience
let
loose
the
fury
of
his
wrath
he
struck
the
door
with
his
clenched
fist
till
the
blood
streamed
on
his
knuckles
it
was
gourlay
who
opened
the
door
to
him
she
started
back
before
his
awful
eyes
john
she
cried
what
wrong
wi
ye
the
sight
of
the
there
before
him
whom
he
had
endured
so
long
and
must
endure
for
ever
was
the
crowning
burden
of
his
night
damn
her
why
did
she
get
out
of
the
way
why
did
she
stand
there
in
her
dirt
and
ask
silly
questions
he
struck
her
on
the
bosom
with
his
great
fist
and
sent
her
spinning
on
the
dirty
table
she
rose
from
among
the
broken
dishes
and
came
towards
him
with
slack
lips
and
great
startled
eyes
john
she
panted
like
a
pitiful
frightened
child
what
have
i
been
doing
man
what
did
you
hit
me
for
he
gaped
at
her
with
hanging
jaw
he
knew
he
was
a
brute
knew
she
had
done
nothing
more
than
she
had
ever
done
knew
he
had
vented
on
her
a
wrath
that
should
have
burst
on
others
but
his
mind
was
at
a
stick
how
could
he
explain
to
he
gaped
and
glowered
for
a
speechless
moment
then
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
into
the
parlour
slamming
the
door
till
the
windows
rattled
in
their
frames
she
stared
after
him
a
while
in
stupor
then
flung
herself
in
her
old
by
the
fire
and
spat
blood
in
the
ribs
hawking
it
up
coarsely
we
forget
to
be
delicate
in
moments
of
supremer
agony
and
then
she
flung
her
apron
over
her
head
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
in
the
chair
where
she
had
nursed
his
children
wailing
it
a
pity
me
it
a
pity
o
me
my
god
ay
it
a
geyan
pity
o
me
the
boy
was
in
bed
but
janet
had
watched
the
scene
with
a
white
scared
face
and
tearful
cries
she
crept
to
her
mother
side
the
sympathy
of
children
with
those
who
weep
is
innocently
selfish
the
sight
of
tears
makes
them
uncomfortable
and
they
want
them
to
cease
in
the
interests
of
their
own
happiness
if
the
outward
signs
of
grief
would
only
vanish
all
would
be
well
they
are
not
old
enough
to
appreciate
the
inward
agony
so
janet
tugged
at
the
obscuring
apron
and
whimpered
do
greet
mother
do
greet
woman
i
dinna
like
to
see
ye
greetin
but
gourlay
still
rocked
herself
and
wailed
it
a
pity
o
me
it
a
pity
o
me
my
god
ay
it
a
geyan
pity
o
me
chapter
xiii
is
he
in
himsell
asked
gibson
the
builder
coming
into
the
emporium
wilson
was
alone
in
the
shop
since
trade
grew
so
brisk
she
had
an
assistant
to
help
her
but
he
was
out
for
his
breakfast
at
present
and
as
it
happened
she
was
all
alone
no
she
said
he
no
in
we
terribly
driven
this
twelvemonth
back
since
trade
grew
so
thrang
and
he
aye
hunting
business
in
some
corner
he
out
the
now
after
a
carrying
affair
was
it
ainything
perticular
she
looked
at
gibson
with
a
speculation
in
her
eyes
that
almost
verged
on
hostility
wives
of
the
lower
classes
who
are
active
helpers
in
a
husband
affairs
often
direct
that
look
upon
strangers
who
approach
him
in
the
way
of
business
for
they
are
enemies
whatever
way
you
take
them
come
to
be
done
by
the
husband
or
to
do
him
in
either
case
therefore
the
object
of
a
sharp
curiosity
you
may
call
on
an
educated
man
either
to
fleece
him
or
be
fleeced
and
his
wife
though
she
knows
all
about
it
will
talk
to
you
charmingly
of
trifles
while
you
wait
for
him
in
her
parlour
but
a
wife
of
the
lower
orders
active
in
her
affairs
has
not
been
trained
to
dissemble
so
prettily
though
her
face
be
a
mask
what
she
is
wondering
comes
out
in
her
eye
there
was
suspicion
in
the
big
round
stare
that
wilson
directed
at
the
builder
what
was
spiering
for
himsell
for
what
could
he
be
up
to
some
end
of
his
own
no
doubt
anxious
curiosity
forced
her
to
inquire
would
i
do
instead
she
asked
well
hardly
said
gibson
clawing
his
chin
and
gazing
at
a
corded
round
of
barbie
best
just
above
his
head
dod
it
a
fine
ham
that
he
said
to
turn
the
subject
how
are
ye
selling
it
the
now
tenpence
a
pound
retail
but
ninepence
only
if
ye
take
a
whole
one
ye
had
better
let
me
send
you
one
gibson
now
that
winter
drawing
on
it
a
heartsome
thing
the
smell
of
frying
ham
on
a
frosty
morning
and
her
laugh
went
skelloching
up
the
street
well
ye
see
said
gibson
with
a
grin
i
expect
wilson
to
present
me
with
one
when
he
hears
the
news
that
i
have
brought
him
aha
said
she
it
something
good
then
and
she
stuck
her
arms
james
she
shrilled
james
and
the
boy
shot
from
the
back
premises
run
up
to
the
red
lion
and
see
if
your
father
has
finished
his
crack
wi
templandmuir
tell
him
gibson
wants
to
see
him
on
important
business
the
boy
squinted
once
at
the
visitor
and
scooted
the
red
head
of
him
foremost
while
gibson
waited
and
clawed
his
chin
she
examined
him
narrowly
suspicion
as
to
the
object
of
his
visit
fixed
her
attention
on
his
face
he
was
a
man
with
mean
brown
eyes
brown
eyes
may
be
clear
and
limpid
as
a
mountain
pool
or
they
may
have
the
fine
black
flash
of
anger
and
the
jovial
gleam
or
they
may
be
mean
things
little
and
sly
and
oily
gibson
had
the
depth
of
cunning
not
the
depth
of
character
and
they
glistened
like
the
eyes
of
a
lustful
animal
he
was
a
reddish
man
with
a
fringe
of
sandy
beard
and
a
perpetual
grin
which
showed
his
yellow
teeth
with
green
deposit
round
their
roots
it
was
more
than
a
grin
it
was
a
semicircular
from
cheek
to
cheek
and
the
beady
eyes
ever
on
the
watch
up
above
it
belied
its
false
benevolence
he
was
not
florid
yet
that
grin
of
his
seemed
to
intensify
his
reddishness
perhaps
because
it
brought
out
and
made
prominent
his
sandy
valance
and
the
ruddy
round
of
his
cheeks
so
that
the
baker
christened
him
long
ago
the
man
with
the
sandy
smile
cunning
johnny
was
his
other
nickname
wilson
had
recognized
a
match
in
him
the
moment
he
came
to
barbie
and
had
resolved
to
act
with
him
if
he
could
but
never
to
act
against
him
they
had
made
advances
to
each
other
birds
of
a
feather
in
short
the
grocer
came
in
hurriedly
and
a
perceptibly
bigger
bulge
in
his
belly
than
when
we
first
saw
him
in
barbie
four
years
ago
now
gibson
he
panted
is
it
private
that
ye
wanted
to
see
me
on
verra
private
said
the
sandy
smiler
we
go
through
to
the
house
then
said
wilson
and
ushered
his
guest
through
the
back
premises
but
the
voice
of
his
wife
recalled
him
james
she
cried
here
for
a
minute
just
and
he
turned
to
her
leaving
gibson
in
the
yard
be
careful
what
you
doing
she
whispered
in
his
ear
it
wasna
for
nothing
they
christened
gibson
johnny
keep
the
dirt
out
your
een
there
no
fear
of
that
he
assured
her
pompously
it
was
a
grand
thing
to
have
a
wife
like
that
but
her
advice
nettled
him
now
just
a
little
because
it
seemed
to
imply
a
doubt
of
his
efficiency
and
that
was
quite
onnecessar
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
they
would
need
to
rise
very
early
that
got
the
better
o
a
man
like
him
you
take
a
dram
said
wilson
when
they
reached
a
pokey
little
room
where
the
most
conspicuous
and
dreary
object
was
a
large
bare
flowerpot
of
red
earthenware
on
a
green
woollen
mat
in
the
middle
of
a
round
table
out
of
the
flowerpot
rose
gauntly
a
frame
up
which
two
lonely
stalks
of
a
climbing
plant
tried
to
scramble
but
failed
miserably
to
reach
the
top
the
round
little
rickety
table
with
the
family
album
on
one
corner
placed
at
what
wilson
considered
a
beautiful
artistic
angle
to
the
window
the
tawdry
cloth
the
green
mat
the
shiny
horsehair
sofa
and
the
stuffy
atmosphere
were
all
in
perfect
harmony
of
ugliness
a
sampler
on
the
wall
informed
the
world
that
there
was
no
place
like
home
wilson
pushed
the
flowerpot
to
one
side
and
you
take
a
dram
he
said
blithely
oh
ay
said
gibson
with
a
grin
i
never
refuse
drink
when
i
offered
it
for
nothing
hi
hi
laughed
wilson
at
the
little
joke
and
produced
a
cut
decanter
and
a
pair
of
glasses
he
filled
the
glasses
so
brimming
full
that
the
drink
ran
over
on
the
table
canny
man
for
god
sake
canny
cried
gibson
starting
forward
in
alarm
do
ye
see
you
spilling
the
mercies
he
stooped
his
lips
to
the
rim
of
his
glass
and
sipped
lest
a
drop
of
scotia
nectar
should
escape
him
they
faced
each
other
sitting
here
pith
said
gibson
pith
said
the
other
in
chorus
and
they
nodded
to
each
other
in
amity
primed
glasses
up
and
ready
and
then
it
was
eyes
heavenward
and
the
little
finger
uppermost
gibson
smacked
his
lips
once
and
again
when
the
fiery
spirit
tickled
his
uvula
ha
said
he
that
the
stuff
to
put
heart
in
a
man
it
no
bad
whisky
said
wilson
complacently
gibson
wiped
the
sandy
stubble
round
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
considered
for
a
moment
then
leaning
forward
he
tapped
wilson
knee
in
whispering
importance
have
you
heard
the
news
he
murmured
with
a
watchful
glimmer
in
his
eyes
no
cried
wilson
glowering
eager
and
alert
ocht
in
the
business
line
is
there
a
possibeelity
for
me
i
oh
there
might
nodded
gibson
playing
his
man
for
a
while
ay
man
cried
wilson
briskly
and
brought
his
chair
an
inch
or
two
forward
gibson
grinned
and
watched
him
with
his
beady
eyes
what
green
teeth
he
has
thought
wilson
who
was
not
fastidious
the
coal
company
are
meaning
to
erect
a
village
for
five
hundred
miners
a
mile
out
the
fleckie
road
and

wilson
mouth
forgot

his

round
as
his
mouth
in
staring
disappointment
was
it
this
he
was
wasting
his
drink
for
where

come
in
he
asked
blankly
gibson
tossed
off
another
glassful
of
the
burning
heartener
of
men
and
leaned
forward
with
his
elbows
on
the
table

the
contract
there
nobody
else
to
compete
the
two
o
ye
imphm
i
see
said
wilson
and
tugged
his
moustache
in
meditation
all
expression
died
out
of
his
face
while
his
brain
churned
within
what
brodie
had
christened
the
considering
keek
was
in
his
eyes
they
were
far
away
and
saw
the
distant
village
in
process
of
erection
busy
with
its
chances
and
occasions
then
an
uneasy
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
and
recall
him
to
the
man
by
his
side
he
stole
a
shifty
glance
at
the
sandy
smiler
but
i
thought
were
a
friend
of
gourlay
he
said
slowly
friendship
said
gibson
we
speaking
of
business
and
friendship
atween
me
and
gourlay
he
was
nebby
owre
a
bill
i
sent
in
the
other
day
and
i
getting
tired
of
his
bluster
besides
there
little
more
to
be
made
of
him
gourlay
bye
but
you
a
rising
man
wilson
and
i
think
that
you
and
me
might
work
thegither
to
our
own
advantage
do
ye
see
yes
just
so
to
the
advantage
of
us
both
oom
i
hardly
see
what
you
driving
at
said
wilson
i
driving
at
this
said
gibson
if
gourlay
kens
you
against
him
for
the
contract
he
cut
his
estimate
down
to
a
ruinous
price
out
sheer
spite
yes
out
o
sheer
spite
rather
than
be
licked
by
in
public
competition
and
if
he
does
that
goudie
and
i
may
do
what
we
like
but
we
canna
help
you
for
it
the
partners
that
decide
the
estimates
sent
in
d
see
imphm
it
the
partners
goudie
has
noathing
to
do
wi
that
and
if
gourlay
once
gets
round
the
partners
you
be
left
out
in
the
cold
for
a
very
loang
time
shivering
sir
shivering
you
will
that
dod
you
right
there
a
danger
of
that
but
i
fail
to
see
how
we
can
prevent
it
we
can
put
gourlay
on
a
wrong
scent
said
gibson
but
how
though
gibson
met
one
question
by
another
what
was
the
charge
for
a
man
and
a
horse
and
a
day
carrying
when
ye
first
came
hereaway
he
asked
only
four
shillings
a
day
said
wilson
promptly
it
has
risen
to
six
now
he
added
exactly
said
gibson
and
with
the
new
works
coming
in
about
the
town
it
rise
to
eight
yet
i
have
it
for
a
fact
that
the
company
willing
to
gie
that
now
if
you
and
me
could
procure
a
job
for
gourlay
at
the
lower
rate
before
the
news
o
this
new
industry
gets
scattered
a
job
that
would
require
the
whole
of
his
plant
you
understand
and
prevent
his
competing
for
the
company
business
we
would
clear
he
clawed
his
chin
to
help
his
arithmetic
we
would
clear
three
hundred
and
pounds
o
difference
on
the
twelvemonth
at
least
would
make
that
he
added
but
you
would
allow
me
a
handsome
commission
of
course
the
odd
hundred
and
seventy
say
for
bringing
the
scheme
before
ye
i
do
think
there
ocht
unreasonable
in
for
it
not
the
mere
twelvemonth
work
that
at
stake
you
understand
it
the
valuable
connection
for
the
now
i
have
influence
wi
goudie
i
can
help
you
there
but
if
gourlay
gets
in
there
just
a
chance
that
you
never
be
able
to
oust
him
i
see
said
wilson
before
he
knows
what
coming
we
to
provide
work
for
gourlay
at
the
lower
rate
both
to
put
money
in
our
own
pocket
and
prevent
him
competing
for
the
better
business
you
summed
it
to
the
nines
said
gibson
yes
said
wilson
blankly
but
how
on
earth
are
to
provide
work
for
him
gibson
leaned
forward
a
second
time
and
tapped
wilson
on
the
knee
have
you
never
considered
what
a
chance
for
building
there
in
that
holm
of
yours
he
asked
you
a
fortune
there
lying
undeveloped
that
was
the
point
to
which
cunning
johnny
had
been
leading
all
the
time
he
cared
as
little
for
wilson
as
for
gourlay
all
he
wanted
was
a
contract
for
covering
wilson
holm
with
houses
and
a
good
commission
on
the
year
carrying
it
was
for
this
he
evolved
the
conspiracy
to
cripple
gourlay
wilson
thoughts
went
to
and
fro
like
the
shuttle
of
a
weaver
he
blinked
in
rapidity
of
thinking
and
stole
shifty
glances
at
his
comrade
he
tugged
his
moustache
and
said
imphm
many
times
then
his
eyes
went
off
in
their
long
preoccupied
stare
and
the
sound
of
the
breath
coming
heavy
through
his
nostrils
was
audible
in
the
quiet
room
wilson
was
one
of
the
men
whom
you
hear
thinking
i
see
he
said
slowly
you
mean
to
bind
gourlay
to
cart
building
material
to
my
holm
at
the
present
price
of
work
you
bind
him
in
general
terms
so
that
he
canna
suspect
till
the
time
comes
who
in
particular
he
to
work
for
in
the
meantime
i
be
free
to
offer
for
the
company
business
at
the
higher
price
that
the
size
said
gibson
wilson
was
staggered
by
the
rapid
combinations
of
the
scheme
but
cunning
johnny
had
him
in
the
toils
the
plan
he
proposed
stole
about
the
grocer
every
weakness
and
tugged
his
inclinations
to
consent
it
was
very
important
he
considered
that
he
and
no
other
should
obtain
this
contract
which
was
both
valuable
in
itself
and
an
earnest
of
other
business
in
the
future
and
gibson
scheme
got
gourlay
the
only
possible
rival
out
of
the
way
for
it
was
not
possible
for
gourlay
to
put
more
than
twelve
horses
on
the
road
and
if
he
thought
he
had
secured
a
good
contract
already
he
would
never
dream
of
applying
for
another
then
wilson
malice
was
gratified
by
the
thought
that
gourlay
who
hated
him
should
have
to
serve
as
helper
and
underling
in
a
scheme
for
his
aggrandizement
that
would
take
down
his
pride
for
him
and
the
commercial
imagination
so
strong
in
wilson
was
inflamed
by
the
vision
of
himself
as
a
wealthy
houseowner
which
gibson
put
before
him
cunning
johnny
knew
all
this
when
he
broached
the
scheme
he
foresaw
the
pull
of
it
on
wilson
nature
yet
wilson
hesitated
he
did
not
like
to
give
himself
to
gibson
quite
so
rapidly
you
go
fast
gibson
said
he
faith
you
go
fast
this
is
a
big
affair
and
needs
to
be
looked
at
for
a
while
fast
cried
gibson
damn
it
we
have
no
time
to
waste
we
maun
act
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
have
to
borrow
money
said
wilson
slowly
and
it
verra
dear
at
the
present
time
it
was
never
worth
more
in
barbie
than
it
is
at
the
present
time
man
do
ye
see
the
chance
you
neglecting
do
ye
see
what
it
means
there
thousands
lying
at
your
back
door
if
ye
only
reach
to
pick
them
up
yes
thousands
thousands
i
telling
ye
thousands
wilson
saw
himself
provost
and
plutocrat
yet
was
he
cautious
do
well
by
the
scheme
he
said
tartly
if
you
get
the
sole
contract
for
building
these
premises
of
mine
and
a
fat
commission
on
the
carrying
forbye
can
you
carry
the
scheme
without
me
said
gibson
a
word
from
me
to
goudie
means
a
heap
there
was
a
veiled
threat
in
the
remark
oh
we
come
to
terms
said
the
other
but
how
will
you
manage
gourlay
aha
said
gibson
i
come
in
handy
for
that
you
discover
there
been
a
backset
in
barbie
for
the
last
year
things
went
owre
quick
at
the
start
and
were
followed
by
a
wee
lull
but
it
only
for
a
time
sir
it
only
for
a
time
it
and
you
thegither
have
damaged
gourlay
he
both
short
o
work
and
scarce
o
cash
as
i
found
to
my
cost
when
i
asked
him
for
my
siller
so
when
i
offer
him
a
big
contract
for
carting
stones
atween
the
quarry
and
the
town
foot
swallow
it
without
question
i
insert
a
clause
that
he
must
deliver
the
stuff
at
such
places
as
i
direct
within
four
hundred
yards
of
the
cross
in
ainy
direction
for
i
several
jobs
near
the
cross
ye
see
and
how
he
to
know
that
yours
is
one
o
them
man
it
easy
to
bamboozle
an
ass
like
gourlay
besides
he
think
my
principals
have
trusted
me
to
let
the
carrying
to
ainy
one
i
like
and
as
i
let
it
to
him
he
fancy
i
on
his
side
doa
ye
see
he
never
jalouse
that
i
mean
to
diddle
him
in
the
meantime
we
spread
the
news
that
you
meaning
to
build
on
a
big
scale
upon
your
own
land
we
have
the
ground
levelled
the
foundations
dug
and
the
drains
and
everything
seen
to
now
it
never
occur
to
gourlay
in
the
present
slackness
trade
that
you
would
contract
wi
another
man
to
cart
your
material
and
go
hunting
for
other
work
yoursell
that
throw
him
off
the
scent
till
the
time
comes
to
put
his
nose
o
when
the
company
advertise
for
estimates
he
canna
compete
wi
you
because
he
to
me
and
he
think
you
out
too
because
you
busy
wi
your
own
woark
you
be
free
to
nip
the
eight
shillings
then
we
force
him
to
fulfill
his
bargain
and
cart
for
us
at
six
if
he
refuses
said
wilson
i
have
the
contract
stamped
and
signed
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
said
gibson
not
that
that
necessary
i
believe
but
a
double
knot
aye
the
safest
wilson
looked
at
him
with
admiration
gosh
gibson
he
cried
you
a
warmer
ye
deserve
your
name
ye
ken
what
the
folk
ca
you
oh
yes
said
gibson
complacently
i
quite
proud
o
the
description
i
my
ain
craw
to
pick
wi
gourlay
he
went
on
he
was
damned
yestreen
when
i
asked
him
to
settle
my
account
and
talked
about
extortion
but
bide
a
wee
bide
a
wee
i
enjoy
the
look
on
his
face
when
he
sees
himself
forced
to
carry
for
you
at
a
rate
lower
than
the
market
price
when
gibson
approached
gourlay
on
the
following
day
he
was
full
of
laments
about
the
poor
state
of
trade
ay
said
he
the
grand
railway
they
boasted
o
hasna
done
muckle
for
the
town
atwell
ay
quoth
gourlay
with
pompous
wisdom
they
maybe
find
or
a
by
that
the
auld
way
wasna
the
warst
way
there
was
to
be
a
great
boom
as
they
but
i
see
few
signs
i
see
few
signs
either
said
gibson
it
the
slackest
time
for
the
last
twa
years
gourlay
grunted
his
assent
but
i
a
grand
job
for
ye
for
a
that
said
gibson
slapping
his
hands
what
do
ye
say
to
the
feck
of
a
year
carting
tweesht
the
quarry
and
the
town
foot
i
might
consider
that
said
gourlay
if
the
terms
were
good
six
shillins
said
gibson
and
went
on
in
solemn
protest
in
the
present
state
o
trade
doa
ye
see
i
couldna
give
a
penny
more
gourlay
who
had
denounced
the
present
state
of
trade
even
now
was
prevented
by
his
own
words
from
asking
for
a
penny
more
at
the
town
foot
you
say
he
asked
i
several
jobs
thereaway
gibson
explained
hurriedly
and
you
must
agree
to
deliver
stuff
ainy
place
i
want
it
within
four
hundred
yards
the
cross
it
all
one
to
you
of
course
he
went
on
seeing
paid
by
the
day
oh
it
all
one
to
me
said
gourlay
peter
riney
and
the
new
orra
man
were
called
in
to
witness
the
agreement
cunning
johnny
had
made
it
as
cunning
as
he
could
we
may
as
well
put
a
stamp
o
said
he
a
stamp
costs
little
and
means
a
heap
you
damned
particular
the
day
cried
gourlay
in
a
sudden
heat
oh
nothing
more
than
my
usual
nothing
more
than
my
usual
said
gibson
blandly
gourlay
and
he
made
for
the
door
buttoning
the
charter
of
his
dear
revenge
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
gourlay
ignored
him
when
gibson
got
out
he
turned
to
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
and
curse
you
said
he
you
may
refuse
to
answer
me
the
day
but
wait
till
this
day
eight
weeks
you
be
roaring
than
on
that
day
eight
weeks
gourlay
received
a
letter
from
gibson
requiring
him
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
deliver
stone
lime
baulks
of
timber
and
iron
girders
in
wilson
holm
in
terms
of
his
agreement
and
in
accordance
with
the
orders
to
be
given
him
from
day
to
day
he
was
apprised
that
a
couple
of
carts
of
lime
and
seven
loads
of
stone
were
needed
on
the
morrow
he
went
down
the
street
with
grinding
jaws
the
letter
crushed
to
a
white
pellet
in
his
hand
it
would
have
gone
ill
with
gibson
had
he
met
him
gourlay
could
not
tell
why
or
to
what
purpose
he
marched
on
and
on
with
forward
staring
eyes
he
only
knew
vaguely
that
the
anger
drove
him
when
he
came
to
the
cross
a
long
string
of
carts
was
filing
from
the
skeighan
road
and
passing
across
to
the
street
leading
he
knew
them
to
be
wilson
the
deacon
was
there
of
course
hobbling
on
his
thin
shanks
and
cocking
his
eye
to
see
everything
that
happened
what
does
this
mean
gourlay
asked
him
though
he
loathed
the
deacon
oh
have
ye
heard
quoth
the
deacon
blithely
that
the
stuff
for
the
new
mining
village
out
the
fleckie
road
wilson
has
nabbed
the
contract
for
the
carting
they
saying
it
was
gibson
influence
goudie
that
helped
him
to
the
getting
amid
his
storm
of
anger
at
the
trick
gourlay
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
pity
for
himself
as
for
a
man
most
unfairly
worsted
he
realized
for
a
moment
his
own
inefficiency
as
a
business
man
in
conflict
with
cleverer
rivals
and
felt
sorry
to
be
thus
handicapped
by
nature
though
wrath
was
uppermost
the
other
feeling
was
revealed
showing
itself
by
a
gulping
in
the
throat
and
a
rapid
blinking
of
the
eyes
the
deacon
marked
the
signs
of
his
chagrin
man
he
reported
to
the
bodies
but
gourlay
was
cut
to
the
quick
his
face
showed
how
gunkit
he
was
oh
but
he
was
chawed
i
saw
his
breist
give
the
great
heave
were
ye
no
sorry
cried
the
baker
thorry
hi
laughed
the
deacon
oh
i
was
thorry
to
be
sure
he
lisped
but
i
didna
i
glad
to
thay
i
a
grand
control
of
my
emotionth
not
like
thum
folk
we
know
of
he
added
slyly
giving
the
baker
a
good
one
all
next
day
gibson
masons
waited
for
their
building
material
in
wilson
holm
but
none
came
and
all
day
seven
of
gourlay
horses
champed
idly
in
their
stalls
barbie
had
a
weekly
market
now
and
as
it
happened
that
was
the
day
it
fell
on
at
two
in
the
afternoon
gourlay
was
standing
on
the
gravel
outside
the
red
lion
trying
to
look
wise
over
a
sample
of
grain
which
a
farmer
had
poured
upon
his
great
palm
gibson
approached
with
false
voice
and
smile
gosh
mr
gourlay
he
cried
protestingly
have
ye
forgotten
whatna
day
it
is
ye
havena
my
men
a
ton
o
stuff
to
gang
on
wi
to
the
farmer
dismay
his
fine
sample
of
grain
was
scattered
on
the
gravel
by
a
convulsive
movement
of
gourlay
arm
as
gourlay
turned
on
his
enemy
his
face
was
frightfully
distorted
all
his
brow
seemed
gathered
in
a
knot
above
his
nose
and
he
gaped
on
his
words
yet
ground
them
out
like
a
labouring
mill
each
word
solid
as
plug
shot
i
see
and
and
every
other
man
son
frying
in
hell
he
said
slowly
ere
a
horse
o
mine
draws
a
stane
wilson
property
be
damned
to
ye
but
there
your
answer
gibson
cunning
deserted
him
for
once
he
put
his
hand
on
shoulder
in
pretended
friendly
remonstrance
take
your
hand
off
my
shouther
said
gourlay
in
a
voice
the
tense
quietness
of
which
should
have
warned
gibson
to
forbear
but
he
actually
shook
gourlay
with
a
feigned
playfulness
next
instant
he
was
high
in
air
for
a
moment
the
hobnails
in
the
soles
of
his
boots
gleamed
vivid
to
the
sun
then
gourlay
sent
him
flying
through
the
big
window
of
the
red
lion
right
on
to
the
middle
of
the
great
table
where
the
were
drinking
for
a
minute
he
lay
stunned
and
bleeding
among
the
broken
crockery
in
a
circle
of
white
faces
and
startled
cries
gourlay
face
appeared
at
the
jagged
rent
his
eyes
narrowed
to
fiercely
gleaming
points
a
hard
triumphant
devilry
playing
round
his
black
lips
you
damned
treacherous
rat
he
cried
that
the
game
john
gourlay
can
play
wi
a
thing
like
you
gibson
rose
from
the
ruin
on
the
table
and
came
bleeding
to
the
window
his
grin
a
of
wrath
his
green
teeth
wolfish
with
anger
by
god
gourlay
he
screamed
i
make
you
pay
for
this
i
fight
you
through
a
the
law
courts
in
breetain
but
you
implement
your
bond
damn
you
for
a
measled
swine
would
you
grunt
at
me
cried
gourlay
and
made
to
go
at
him
through
the
window
though
he
could
not
reach
him
gibson
quailed
at
his
look
he
shook
his
fist
in
impotent
wrath
and
spat
threats
of
justice
through
his
green
teeth
to
hell
wi
your
cried
gourlay
i
throttle
ye
like
the
dog
you
are
on
the
floor
o
the
house
o
lords
but
that
day
was
to
cost
him
dear
ere
six
months
passed
he
was
cast
in
damages
and
costs
for
a
breach
of
contract
aggravated
by
assault
he
appealed
of
course
he
was
not
to
be
done
he
would
show
the
dogs
what
he
thought
of
them
chapter
xiv
in
those
days
it
came
to
pass
that
wilson
sent
his
son
to
the
high
school
of
skeighan
even
james
the
one
with
the
squint
in
his
eye
whereupon
gourlay
sent
son
to
the
high
school
of
skeighan
too
of
course
to
be
upsides
with
wilson
if
wilson
could
afford
to
send
his
boy
to
a
distant
and
expensive
school
then
by
the
lord
so
could
he
and
it
also
came
to
pass
that
james
the
son
of
james
the
grocer
took
many
prizes
but
john
the
son
of
john
took
no
prizes
whereat
there
were
ructions
in
the
house
of
gourlay
gourlay
resolve
to
be
equal
to
wilson
in
everything
he
did
was
his
main
reason
for
sending
his
son
to
the
high
school
of
skeighan
that
he
saw
his
business
decreasing
daily
was
a
reason
too
young
gourlay
was
a
lad
of
fifteen
now
undersized
for
his
age
at
that
time
though
he
soon
shot
up
to
be
a
swaggering
youngster
he
had
been
looking
forward
with
delight
to
helping
his
father
in
the
business
how
grand
it
would
be
to
drive
about
the
country
and
see
things
and
he
had
irked
at
being
kept
for
so
long
under
the
tawse
of
old
but
if
the
business
went
on
at
this
rate
there
would
be
little
in
it
for
the
boy
gourlay
was
not
without
a
thought
of
his
son
welfare
when
he
packed
him
off
to
skeighan
he
would
give
him
some
he
said
let
him
make
a
kirk
or
a
mill
but
john
shrank
from
the
prospect
was
he
still
to
drudge
at
books
was
he
to
go
out
among
strangers
whom
he
feared
his
imagination
set
to
work
on
what
he
heard
of
the
high
school
of
skeighan
and
made
it
a
bugbear
they
had
to
do
mathematics
what
could
do
wi
thae
whigmaleeries
they
had
to
recite
shakespeare
in
public
how
could
stand
up
and
spout
before
a
whole
them
i
do
want
to
gang
he
whined
want
flamed
his
father
what
does
it
matter
what
want
go
you
shall
i
thocht
i
was
to
help
in
the
business
whimpered
john
business
sneered
his
father
a
fine
help
would
be
in
business
ay
man
johnnie
said
his
mother
maternal
fondness
coming
out
in
support
of
her
husband
you
should
be
glad
your
father
can
allow
ye
the
opportunity
eh
but
it
a
grand
thing
a
gude
education
you
may
rise
to
be
a
minister
her
ambition
could
no
further
go
but
gourlay
seemed
to
have
formed
a
different
opinion
of
the
sacred
calling
it
a
he
fit
for
he
growled
so
john
was
put
to
the
high
school
of
skeighan
travelling
backwards
and
forwards
night
and
morning
by
the
train
after
the
railway
had
been
opened
and
he
discovered
on
trying
it
that
the
life
was
not
so
bad
as
he
had
feared
he
hated
his
lessons
true
and
avoided
them
whenever
he
was
able
but
his
father
pride
and
his
mother
fondness
saw
that
he
was
well
dressed
and
with
money
in
his
pocket
and
he
began
to
grow
important
though
gourlay
was
no
longer
the
only
big
man
of
barbie
he
was
still
one
of
the
big
men
and
a
consciousness
of
the
fact
grew
upon
his
son
when
he
passed
his
old
classmates
apprentice
grocers
now
and
carters
and
ploughboys
his
febrile
insolence
led
him
to
swagger
and
assume
and
it
was
fine
to
mount
the
train
at
barbie
on
the
fresh
cool
mornings
and
be
off
past
the
gleaming
rivers
and
the
woods
better
still
was
the
to
board
the
empty
train
at
skeighan
when
the
afternoon
sun
came
pleasant
through
the
windows
to
loll
on
the
fat
cushions
and
read
the
novelettes
he
learned
to
smoke
too
and
that
was
a
source
of
pride
when
the
train
was
full
on
market
days
he
liked
to
get
in
among
the
jovial
farmers
who
encouraged
his
assumptions
meanwhile
jimmy
wilson
would
be
elsewhere
in
the
train
busy
with
his
lessons
for
the
morrow
for
jimmy
had
to
help
in
the
emporium
of
nights
his
father
kept
him
to
the
grindstone
jimmy
had
no
more
real
ability
than
young
gourlay
but
infinitely
more
caution
he
was
one
of
the
gimlet
characters
who
by
diligence
and
memory
gain
prizes
in
their
school
days
and
are
fools
for
the
remainder
of
their
lives
the
bodies
of
barbie
seeing
young
gourlay
at
his
pranks
speculated
over
his
future
as
scottish
bodies
do
about
the
future
of
every
youngster
in
their
ken
i
wonder
what
that
son
o
gourlay
come
till
said
sandy
toddle
musing
on
him
with
the
eye
of
the
scots
peasant
to
no
good
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
connal
he
a
regular
splurge
when
drunk
dan
kennedy
passed
him
his
flask
in
the
train
the
other
day
he
swigged
it
just
for
the
sake
of
showing
off
and
he
a
coward
too
for
all
his
swagger
he
grew
when
he
swallowed
the
drink
and
dan
to
frighten
him
threatened
to
hang
him
from
the
window
by
the
heels
he
did
mean
it
to
be
sure
but
young
gourlay
grew
white
at
the
very
idea
he
shook
like
a
dog
in
a
wet
sack
he
cried
shivering
the
ground
would
go
flying
past
your
eyes
how
quick
the
wheel
opposite
ye
would
buzz
it
would
blind
ye
by
its
quickness
how
the
gray
slag
would
flash
below
ye
those
were
his
very
words
he
seemed
to
see
the
thing
as
if
it
were
happening
before
his
eyes
and
stared
like
a
fellow
in
hysteerics
till
dan
was
obliged
to
give
him
another
drink
would
spue
with
the
dizziness
said
he
and
he
actually
bocked
himsell
young
gourlay
seemed
bent
on
making
good
the
prophecy
of
barbie
though
his
father
was
spending
money
he
could
ill
afford
on
his
education
he
fooled
away
his
time
his
mind
developed
a
little
no
doubt
since
it
was
no
longer
dazed
by
brutal
and
repeated
floggings
in
some
of
his
classes
he
did
fairly
well
but
others
he
loathed
it
was
the
rule
at
skeighan
high
school
to
change
rooms
every
hour
the
classes
tramping
from
one
to
another
through
a
big
lobby
gourlay
got
a
habit
of
stealing
off
at
such
times
it
was
easy
to
slip
out
and
playing
truant
in
the
byways
of
skeighan
he
often
made
his
way
to
the
station
and
loafed
in
the
waiting
room
he
had
gone
there
on
a
summer
afternoon
to
avoid
his
mathematics
and
read
a
novel
when
a
terrible
thing
befell
him
for
a
while
he
swaggered
round
the
empty
platform
and
smoked
a
cigarette
clanked
in
a
shed
mournfully
gourlay
had
a
congenital
horror
of
eerie
sounds
he
was
his
mother
son
for
that
and
he
fled
to
the
waiting
room
to
avoid
the
hollow
clang
it
was
a
june
afternoon
of
brooding
heat
and
a
band
of
yellow
sunshine
was
lying
on
the
glazed
table
showing
every
scratch
in
its
surface
the
place
oppressed
him
he
was
sorry
he
had
come
but
he
plunged
into
his
novel
and
forgot
the
world
he
started
in
fear
when
a
voice
addressed
him
he
looked
up
and
here
it
was
only
the
baker
the
baker
smiling
at
him
with
his
fine
gray
eyes
the
baker
with
his
reddish
fringe
of
beard
and
his
honest
grin
which
wrinkled
up
his
face
to
his
eyes
in
merry
and
kindly
wrinkles
he
had
a
wonderful
hearty
manner
with
a
boy
ay
man
john
it
you
said
the
baker
dod
i
just
in
time
the
storm
at
the
burstin
storm
said
gourlay
he
had
a
horror
of
lightning
since
the
day
of
his
birth
ay
we
in
for
a
pelter
what
have
you
been
doing
that
you
didna
they
went
to
the
window
the
fronting
heavens
were
a
black
purple
the
thunder
which
had
been
growling
in
the
distance
swept
forward
and
roared
above
the
town
the
crash
no
longer
rolled
afar
but
cracked
close
to
the
ear
hard
crepitant
quick
lightning
stabbed
the
world
in
vicious
and
repeated
hate
a
moistness
lay
heavy
on
the
cowering
earth
the
rain
came
a
few
drops
at
first
sullen
as
if
loath
to
come
that
splashed
on
the
pavement
wide
as
a
crown
piece
then
a
white
rush
of
slanting
spears
a
great
blob
shot
in
through
the
window
open
at
the
top
and
spat
wide
on
gourlay
cheek
it
was
lukewarm
he
started
violently
that
warmth
on
his
cheek
brought
the
terror
so
near
the
heavens
were
rent
with
a
crash
and
the
earth
seemed
on
fire
gourlay
screamed
in
terror
the
baker
put
his
arm
round
him
in
kindly
protection
tuts
man
dinna
be
feared
he
said
you
john
gourlay
son
ye
know
you
ought
to
be
a
hardy
man
ay
but
i
no
chattered
john
the
truth
coming
out
in
his
fear
i
just
let
on
to
be
but
the
worst
was
soon
over
lightning
both
sheeted
and
forked
was
vivid
as
ever
but
the
thunder
slunk
growling
away
the
heavens
are
opening
and
shutting
like
a
man
eye
said
gourlay
oh
it
a
terrible
thing
the
world
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
a
flash
shot
into
a
mounded
wood
far
away
it
stabbed
it
like
a
dagger
stared
gourlay
look
look
did
ye
see
yon
it
came
down
in
a
broad
flash
then
jerked
to
the
side
then
ran
down
to
a
sharp
point
again
it
was
like
the
coulter
of
a
plough
suddenly
a
blaze
of
lightning
flamed
wide
and
a
fork
shot
down
its
centre
that
said
gourlay
was
like
a
red
crack
in
a
furnace
door
man
you
a
noticing
boy
said
the
baker
ay
said
john
smiling
in
curious
i
notice
things
too
much
they
give
me
pictures
in
my
mind
i
feared
of
them
but
i
like
to
think
them
over
when
they
by
boys
are
slow
of
confidence
to
their
elders
but
gourlay
terror
and
the
baker
kindness
moved
him
to
speak
in
a
vague
way
he
wanted
to
explain
i
no
feared
of
folk
he
went
on
with
a
faint
return
to
his
swagger
but
things
get
in
on
me
a
body
seems
so
wee
compared
with
that
he
nodded
to
the
warring
heavens
the
baker
did
not
understand
have
you
seen
your
faither
he
asked
my
faither
john
gasped
in
terror
if
his
father
should
find
him
playing
truant
yes
did
ye
no
ken
he
was
in
skeighan
we
come
up
thegither
by
the
ten
train
and
are
meaning
to
gang
hame
by
this
i
expect
him
every
moment
john
turned
to
escape
in
the
doorway
stood
his
father
when
gourlay
was
in
wrath
he
had
a
widening
glower
that
enveloped
the
offender
yet
his
eye
seemed
to
stab
a
flash
shot
from
its
centre
to
transfix
and
pierce
gaze
at
a
tiger
through
the
bars
of
his
cage
and
you
will
see
the
look
it
widens
and
concentrates
at
once
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
with
the
glower
on
his
son
i
i
i
john
stammered
and
choked
what
are
you
doing
here
said
his
father
john
fingers
worked
before
him
his
eyes
were
large
and
aghast
on
his
father
though
his
mouth
hung
open
no
words
would
come
how
lang
has
he
been
here
baker
there
was
a
curious
regard
between
gourlay
and
the
baker
gourlay
spoke
with
a
firm
civility
oh
just
a
wee
whilie
said
the
baker
i
see
you
want
to
shield
you

been

truant

pleaded
the
baker
a
boy
but
a
boy
dinna

gourlay
i

high
school
of

damned
good
care

get
my
money
worth
i
do
mean
to
hire
dowgs
and
bark
for
mysell
he
grabbed
his
son
by
the
coat
collar
and
swung
him
out
the
room
down
high
street
he
marched
carrying
his
cub
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
as
you
might
carry
a
dirty
puppy
to
an
outhouse
john
was
black
in
the
face
time
and
again
in
his
wrath
gourlay
swung
him
off
the
ground
grocers
coming
to
their
doors
to
scatter
fresh
yellow
sawdust
on
the
old
now
trampled
black
and
wet
on
the
sills
stared
sideways
chins
up
and
mouths
open
after
the
strange
spectacle
but
gourlay
splashed
on
amid
the
staring
crowd
never
looking
to
the
right
or
left
opposite
the
fiddler
inn
whom
should
they
meet
but
wilson
a
snigger
shot
to
his
features
at
the
sight
gourlay
swung
the
boy
up
for
a
moment
a
wild
impulse
surged
within
him
to
club
his
rival
with
his
own
son
he
marched
into
the
vestibule
of
the
high
school
the
boy
dangling
from
his
great
hand
where
your
gaffer
he
roared
at
the
janitor
gaffer
blinked
the
janitor
gaffer
dominie
whatever
the
damn
you
ca
him
the
fellow
that
runs
the
business
the
headmaster
said
the
janitor
heidmaister
ay
said
gourlay
in
scorn
and
went
trampling
after
the
janitor
down
a
long
wooden
corridor
a
door
was
flung
open
showing
a
classroom
where
the
headmaster
was
seated
teaching
greek
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
figure
in
the
door
with
his
fierce
gleaming
eyes
and
the
shining
on
his
frieze
coat
brought
into
the
close
academic
air
the
sharp
strong
gust
of
an
outer
world
i
believe
i
pay
to
look
after
that
boy
thundered
gourlay
is
this
the
way
you
do
your
work
and
with
the
word
he
sent
his
son
spinning
along
the
floor
like
a
till
he
rattled
a
wet
huddled
lump
against
a
row
of
chairs
john
slunk
bleeding
behind
the
master
really
said
maccandlish
rising
in
protest
do
me
sir
i
pay
to
teach
that
boy
and
you
allow
him
to
run
idle
in
the
streets
what
have
you
to
seh
but
what
can
i
do
bleated
maccandlish
with
a
white
spread
of
deprecating
hands
the
stronger
man
took
the
grit
from
his
limbs
do
do
damn
it
sir
am
to
be
dominie

to
teach

duty
do
flog

if

hame
wi
the
welts
on
him
as
thick
as
that
forefinger
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
misterr
maccandlish
he
was
gone
they
heard
him
go
clumping
along
the
corridor
thereafter
young
gourlay
had
to
stick
to
his
books
and
as
we
know
the
forced
union
of
opposites
breeds
the
greater
disgust
between
them
however
his
school
days
would
soon
be
over
and
meanwhile
it
was
fine
to
pose
on
his
journeys
to
and
fro
as
young
hopeful
of
the
green
shutters
he
was
smoking
at
skeighan
station
on
an
afternoon
as
the
barbie
train
was
on
the
point
of
starting
he
was
staying
on
the
platform
till
the
last
moment
in
order
to
show
the
people
how
nicely
he
could
bring
the
smoke
down
his
nostrils
his
prince
of
wales
feathers
he
called
the
great
curling
puffs
as
he
dallied
a
little
aback
from
an
open
window
he
heard
a
voice
which
he
knew
mentioning
the
gourlays
it
was
templandmuir
who
was
speaking
i
see
that
gourlay
has
lost
his
final
appeal
in
that
lawsuit
of
his
said
the
templar
d
tell
me
that
said
a
strange
voice
then
gosh
he
must
have
lost
infernal
atweel
has
he
that
said
templandmuir
the
costs
must
have
been
enormous
and
then
there
the
damages
he
would
have
been
better
to
and
be
done
but
his
pride
made
him
fight
it
to
the
hindmost
it
has
made
touch
the
boddom
of
his
purse
i
wager
ye
weel
weel
it
help
to
subdue
his
pride
a
bit
and
muckle
was
the
need
o
that
young
gourlay
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fear
the
prosperity
of
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
had
been
a
fact
of
his
existence
it
had
never
entered
his
boyish
mind
to
question
its
continuance
but
a
weakening
doubt
stole
through
his
limbs
what
would
become
of
him
if
the
gourlays
were
threatened
with
disaster
he
had
a
terrifying
vision
of
himself
as
a
lonely
atomy
adrift
on
a
tossing
world
cut
off
from
his
anchorage
mother
are
ever
likely
to
be
ill
off
he
asked
his
mother
that
evening
she
ran
her
fingers
through
his
hair
pushing
it
back
from
his
brow
fondly
he
was
as
tall
as
herself
now
no
no
dear
what
makes
ye
think
that
your
father
has
always
had
a
grand
business
and
i
brought
a
hantle
money
to
the
house
hokey
said
the
youth
when
ah
in
the
business
ah
have
the
times
chapter
xv
gourlay
was
hard
up
for
money
every
day
of
his
life
taught
him
that
he
was
nowhere
in
the
stress
of
modern
competition
the
grand
days
only
a
few
years
back
but
seeming
half
a
century
away
so
much
had
happened
in
between
the
grand
days
when
he
was
the
only
big
man
in
the
locality
and
carried
everything
with
a
high
hand
had
disappeared
for
ever
now
all
was
bustle
hurry
and
confusion
the
getting
and
sending
of
telegrams
quick
dispatches
by
railway
the
watching
of
markets
at
a
distance
rapid
combinations
that
bewildered
gourlay
duller
mind
at
first
he
was
too
obstinate
to
try
the
newer
methods
when
he
did
he
was
too
stupid
to
use
them
cleverly
when
he
plunged
it
was
always
at
the
wrong
time
for
he
plunged
at
random
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
had
lost
heavily
of
late
both
in
grain
and
cheese
and
the
lawsuit
with
gibson
had
crippled
him
it
was
well
for
him
that
property
in
barbie
had
increased
in
value
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
was
to
prove
the
buttress
of
his
fortune
already
he
had
borrowed
considerably
upon
that
security
he
was
now
dressing
to
go
to
skeighan
and
get
more
brodie
gurney
and
yarrowby
of
glasgow
were
the
lawyers
who
financed
him
and
he
had
to
sign
some
papers
at
goudie
office
ere
he
touched
the
cash
he
was
meaning
to
drive
of
course
gourlay
was
proud
of
his
gig
and
always
kept
a
spanking
roadster
what
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
you
thought
as
you
saw
him
coming
swiftly
towards
you
seated
high
on
his
driving
cushion
that
driving
cushion
was
gourlay
pedestal
from
which
he
looked
down
on
barbie
for
many
a
day
a
quick
step
yet
shambling
came
along
the
lobby
there
was
a
pause
as
of
one
gathering
heart
for
a
venture
then
a
clumsy
knock
on
the
door
come
in
snapped
gourlay
peter
riney
queer
little
old
face
edged
timorously
into
the
room
he
only
opened
the
door
the
width
of
his
face
and
looked
ready
to
bolt
at
a
word
tam
deid
he
blurted
gourlay
gashed
himself
frightfully
with
his
razor
and
a
big
red
blob
stood
out
on
his
cheek
deid
he
stared
yes
stammered
peter
he
was
right
enough
when
elshie
gae
him
his
feed
this
morning
but
when
i
went
in
enow
to
put
the
harness
on
he
was
lying
deid
in
the
the
batts
it
like
for
a
moment
gourlay
stared
with
the
open
mouth
of
an
angry
surprise
forgetting
to
take
down
his
razor
aweel
peter
he
said
at
last
and
peter
went
away
the
loss
of
his
pony
touched
gourlay
to
the
quick
he
had
been
stolid
and
dour
in
his
other
misfortunes
had
taken
them
as
they
came
calmly
he
was
not
the
man
to
whine
and
cry
out
against
the
angry
heavens
he
had
neither
the
weakness
nor
the
width
of
nature
to
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
but
the
sudden
death
of
his
gallant
roadster
his
proud
pacer
through
the
streets
of
barbie
touched
him
with
a
sense
of
quite
personal
loss
and
bereavement
coming
on
the
heels
of
his
other
calamities
it
seemed
to
make
them
more
poignant
more
sinister
prompting
the
question
if
misfortune
would
never
have
an
end
damn
it
i
have
enough
to
thole
gourlay
muttered
surely
there
was
no
need
for
this
to
happen
and
when
he
looked
in
the
mirror
to
fasten
his
stock
and
saw
the
dark
strong
face
he
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
with
a
curious
compassion
for
the
man
before
him
as
for
one
who
was
being
hardly
used
the
hard
lips
could
never
have
framed
the
words
but
the
vague
feeling
in
his
heart
as
he
looked
at
the
dark
vision
was
it
a
pity
of
you
sir
he
put
on
his
coat
rapidly
and
went
out
to
the
stable
an
instinct
prompted
him
to
lock
the
door
he
entered
the
a
shaft
of
golden
light
aswarm
with
motes
slanted
in
the
quietness
tam
lay
on
the
straw
his
head
far
out
his
neck
unnaturally
long
his
limbs
sprawling
rigid
what
a
spanker
tam
had
been
what
gallant
drives
they
had
had
together
when
he
first
put
tam
between
the
shafts
five
years
ago
he
had
been
driving
his
world
before
him
plenty
of
cash
and
a
big
way
of
doing
now
tam
was
dead
and
his
master
netted
in
a
mesh
of
care
i
was
always
gude
to
the
beasts
at
any
rate
gourlay
muttered
as
if
pleading
in
his
own
defence
for
a
long
time
he
stared
down
at
the
sprawling
carcass
musing
tam
the
powney
he
said
twice
nodding
his
head
each
time
he
said
it
tam
the
powney
and
he
turned
away
how
was
he
to
get
to
skeighan
he
plunged
at
his
watch
the
ten
train
had
already
gone
the
express
did
not
stop
at
barbie
if
he
waited
till
one
he
would
be
late
for
his
appointment
there
was
a
brake
true
which
ran
to
skeighan
every
tuesday
it
was
a
downcome
though
for
a
man
who
had
been
proud
of
driving
behind
his
own
horseflesh
to
pack
in
among
a
crowd
of
the
barbie
sprats
and
if
he
went
by
the
brake
he
would
be
sure
to
rub
shoulders
with
his
stinging
and
detested
foes
it
was
a
fine
day
like
enough
the
whole
of
them
would
be
going
with
the
brake
to
skeighan
gourlay
who
shrank
from
nothing
shrank
from
the
winks
that
would
be
sure
to
pass
when
they
saw
him
the
haughty
the
aloof
forced
to
creep
among
them
cheek
for
jowl
then
his
angry
pride
rushed
towering
to
his
aid
was
john
gourlay
to
turn
tail
for
a
wheen
o
the
barbie
dirt
damn
the
fear
it
was
a
public
conveyance
he
had
the
same
right
to
use
it
as
the
rest
o
folk
the
place
of
departure
for
the
brake
was
the
black
bull
at
the
cross
nearly
opposite
to
wilson
there
were
winks
and
stares
and
when
the
folk
hanging
round
saw
gourlay
coming
forward
but
he
paid
no
heed
gourlay
in
spite
of
his
mad
violence
when
roused
was
a
man
at
all
other
times
of
a
grave
and
orderly
demeanour
he
never
splurged
even
his
bluster
was
not
bluster
for
he
never
threatened
the
thing
which
he
had
not
it
in
him
to
do
he
walked
quietly
into
the
empty
brake
and
took
his
seat
in
the
corner
at
the
top
close
below
the
driver
as
he
had
expected
the
barbie
bodies
had
mustered
in
strength
for
skeighan
in
a
country
brake
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
important
men
to
mount
beside
the
driver
in
order
to
take
the
air
and
show
themselves
off
to
an
admiring
world
on
the
dickey
were
connal
and
sandy
toddle
and
between
them
the
deacon
tightly
wedged
the
deacon
was
so
thin
the
bodie
that
though
he
was
wedged
closely
he
could
turn
and
address
himself
to
tam
brodie
who
was
seated
next
the
door
the
fun
began
when
the
horses
were
crawling
up
the
first
brae
the
deacon
turned
with
a
wink
to
brodie
and
dropping
a
glance
on
the
crown
of
gourlay
hat
tummuth
he
lisped
what
a
dirty
place
that
ith
pointing
to
a
hovel
by
the
wayside
brodie
took
the
cue
at
once
his
big
face
flushed
with
a
malicious
grin
ay
he
bellowed
the
owner
o
that
maun
be
married
to
a
dirty
wife
i
thinking
it
must
be
terrible
said
the
deacon
to
be
married
to
a
dirty
trollop
terrible
laughed
brodie
it
enough
to
give
ainy
man
a
gurly
temper
they
had
gourlay
on
the
hip
at
last
more
than
arrogance
had
kept
him
off
from
the
bodies
of
the
town
a
consciousness
also
that
he
was
not
their
match
in
malicious
innuendo
the
direct
attack
he
could
meet
superbly
downing
his
opponent
with
a
coarse
birr
of
the
tongue
to
the
veiled
gibe
he
was
a
quivering
hulk
to
be
prodded
at
your
ease
and
now
the
malignants
were
around
him
while
he
could
not
get
away
talking
each
other
indeed
but
him
while
he
must
keep
quiet
in
their
midst
at
every
brae
they
came
to
and
there
were
many
braes
the
bodies
played
their
malicious
game
shouting
remarks
along
the
brake
to
each
ears
to
his
comprehension
the
new
house
of
templandmuir
was
seen
above
the
trees
what
a
splendid
house
templandmuir
has
built
cried
the
splendid
echoed
brodie
but
a
laird
like
the
templar
has
a
right
to
a
fine
mansion
such
as
that
he
no
like
some
merchants
we
ken
o
who
throw
away
money
on
a
house
for
no
other
end
but
vanity
many
a
man
builds
a
grand
house
for
a
when
he
has
verra
little
to
support
it
but
the
templar
different
he
has
made
a
mint
of
money
since
he
took
the
quarry
in
his
own
hand
he
verra
thick
wi
wilson
i
notice
piped
the
deacon
turning
with
a
grin
and
a
gleaming
droop
of
the
eye
on
the
head
of
his
tormented
enemy
the
deacon
face
was
alive
and
quick
with
the
excitement
of
the
game
his
face
flushed
with
an
eager
grin
his
eyes
glittering
decent
folk
in
the
brake
behind
felt
compunctious
visitings
when
they
saw
him
turn
with
the
flushed
grin
and
the
gleaming
squint
on
the
head
of
his
enduring
victim
now
for
another
stab
they
thought
you
may
well
say
that
shouted
brodie
wilson
has
procured
the
whole
of
the
templar
carterage
oh
wilson
has
become
a
power
yon
new
houses
of
his
must
be
bringing
in
a
braw
i
thinking
connal
that
wilson
ought
to
be
the
provost
strange
cried
the
former
head
of
the
town
that
should
have
been
thinking
that
i
just
been
in
the
same
mind
wilson
by
far
and
away
the
most
progressive
man
we
have
what
a
business
he
has
built
in
two
or
three
years
he
has
that
shouted
brodie
he
goes
up
the
brae
as
fast
as
some
other
folk
are
going
dow
and
yet
they
tell
me
he
got
a
verra
poor
welcome
from
some
of
us
the
first
morning
he
appeared
in
barbie
gourlay
gave
no
sign
others
would
have
shown
by
the
moist
glisten
of
in
the
eye
or
the
scowl
of
wrath
how
much
they
were
moved
but
gourlay
stared
calmly
before
him
his
chin
resting
on
the
head
of
his
staff
resolute
immobile
like
a
stone
head
at
gaze
in
the
desert
only
the
larger
fullness
of
his
fine
nostril
betrayed
the
hell
of
wrath
seething
within
him
and
when
they
alighted
in
skeighan
an
observant
boy
said
to
his
mother
i
saw
the
marks
of
his
chirted
teeth
through
his
jaw
but
they
were
still
far
from
skeighan
and
gourlay
had
much
to
thole
did
ye
hear
shouted
brodie
that
wilson
is
sending
his
son
to
the
college
at
embro
in
october
d
tell
me
that
said
the
provost
what
a
successful
lad
that
has
been
he
a
credit
to
moar
than
wilson
he
a
credit
to
the
whole
town
ay
yelled
brodie
the
money
wasna
wasted
on
it
must
be
a
terrible
thing
when
a
man
has
a
splurging
ass
for
his
son
that
never
got
a
prize
the
provost
began
to
get
nervous
brodie
was
going
too
far
it
was
all
very
well
for
brodie
who
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
wagonette
and
out
of
danger
but
if
he
provoked
an
outbreak
gourlay
would
think
nothing
of
tearing
provost
and
deacon
from
their
perch
and
tossing
them
across
the
hedge
what
does
wilson
mean
to
make
of
his
son
he
inquired
a
civil
enough
question
surely
oh
a
minister
that
mean
six
or
seven
years
at
the
university
indeed
said
the
provost
that
cost
an
enormous
siller
oh
yelled
brodie
but
wilson
can
afford
it
it
not
everybody
can
it
all
verra
well
to
send
your
son
to
skeighan
high
school
but
when
it
comes
to
sending
him
to
college
it
time
to
think
twice
of
what
you
doing
especially
if
you
little
money
left
to
come
and
go
on
yeth
lisped
the
deacon
if
a
man
canna
afford
to
college
his
son
he
had
better
put
him
in
hith
business
if
he
hath
ainy
business
left
to
thpeak
o
that
ith
the
brake
swung
on
through
merry
cornfields
where
reapers
were
at
work
past
happy
brooks
flashing
to
the
sun
through
the
solemn
hush
of
ancient
and
mysterious
woods
beneath
the
great
clouds
and
blue
spaces
of
the
sky
and
amid
the
suave
enveloping
greatness
of
the
world
the
human
pismires
stung
each
other
and
were
cruel
and
full
of
hate
and
malice
and
a
petty
rage
oh
damn
it
enough
of
this
said
the
baker
at
last
enough
of
what
blustered
brodie
of
you
and
your
gibes
said
the
baker
with
a
wry
mouth
of
disgust
damn
it
man
leave
folk
alane
gourlay
turned
to
him
quietly
thank
you
baker
he
said
slowly
but
do
interfere
on
my
behalf
john
gourla
he
dwelt
on
his
name
in
ringing
pride
john
gourla
can
fight
for
his
own
hand
if
so
there
need
to
be
and
pay
no
heed
to
the
thing
before
ye
the
mair
ye
tramp
on
a
dirt
it
spreads
the
wider
who
was
referring
to
bellowed
brodie
gourlay
looked
over
at
him
in
the
far
corner
of
the
brake
with
the
glower
that
made
people
blink
brodie
blinked
rapidly
trying
to
stare
fiercely
the
while
maybe
ye
werena
referring
to
me
said
gourlay
slowly
but
if
had
been
in
your
end
o
the
brake
would
have
been
in
hell
or
this
he
had
said
enough
there
was
silence
in
the
brake
till
it
reached
skeighan
but
the
evil
was
done
enough
had
been
said
to
influence
gourlay
to
the
most
disastrous
resolution
of
his
life
get
yourself
ready
for
the
college
in
october
he
ordered
his
son
that
evening
the
college
cried
john
aghast
yes

ainything

that
to
gape
at

his
father
in
sudden
irritation
at
the
boy
amaze
but
i
do
want
to
gang

whimpered
as
before

damned

chance

of
money

his

command
was
not
only
tyrannical
but
treacherous
there
had
been
nothing
to
warn
him
of
a
coming
change
for
gourlay
was
too
contemptuous
of
his
wife
and
children
to
inform
them
how
his
business
stood
john
had
been
brought
up
to
go
into
the
business
and
now
at
the
last
moment
he
was
undeceived
and
ordered
off
to
a
new
life
from
which
every
instinct
of
his
being
shrank
afraid
he
was
cursed
with
an
imagination
in
excess
of
his
brains
and
in
the
haze
of
the
future
he
saw
two
pictures
with
uncanny
vividness
himself
in
bleak
lodgings
raising
his
head
from
virgil
to
wonder
what
they
were
doing
at
home
and
contrasted
with
that
loneliness
the
others
his
cronies
laughing
along
the
country
roads
beneath
the
glimmer
of
the
stars
they
would
be
having
the
fine
ploys
while
he
was
mewed
up
in
edinburgh
must
he
leave
loved
barbie
and
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
must
he
still
drudge
at
books
which
he
loathed
must
he
venture
on
a
new
life
where
everything
terrified
his
mind
it
a
shame
he
cried
and
i
refuse
to
go
i
do
want
to
leave
barbie
i
feared
of
edinburgh
and
there
he
stopped
in
conscious
impotence
of
speech
how
could
he
explain
his
forebodings
to
a
rock
of
a
man
like
his
father
no
more
roared
gourlay
flinging
out
his
hand
not
another
word
you
go
to
college
in
october
ay
man
johnny
said
his
mother
think
o
the
future
that
before
ye
ay
howled
the
youth
in
silly
anger
it
like
to
be
a
braw
future
it
the
best
future
you
can
have
growled
his
father
for
while
rivalry
born
of
hate
was
the
propelling
influence
in
gourlay
mind
other
reasons
whispered
that
the
course
suggested
by
hate
was
a
good
one
on
its
merits
his
judgment
such
as
it
was
supported
the
impulse
of
his
blood
it
told
him
that
the
old
business
would
be
a
poor
heritage
for
his
son
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
look
for
another
opening
the
boy
gave
no
sign
of
aggressive
smartness
to
warrant
a
belief
that
he
would
ever
pull
the
thing
together
better
make
him
a
minister
surely
there
was
enough
money
left
about
the
house
for
it
was
the
best
that
could
befall
him
gourlay
for
her
part
though
sorry
to
lose
her
son
was
so
pleased
at
the
thought
of
sending
him
to
college
and
making
him
a
minister
that
she
ran
on
in
foolish
maternal
gabble
to
the
wife
of
drucken
webster
webster
informed
the
gossips
and
they
discussed
the
matter
at
the
cross
dod
said
sandy
toddle
gourlay
better
off
than
i
supposed
huts
said
brodie
it
just
a
wheen
bluff
to
blind
folk
it
would
fit
him
better
said
the
doctor
if
he
spent
some
money
on
his
daughter
she
ought
to
pass
the
winter
in
a
warmer
locality
than
barbie
the
lassie
has
a
poor
chest
i
told
gourlay
but
he
only
gave
a
grunt
and
said
gourlay
would
be
a
thing
to
send
away
when
john
maun
be
weel
provided
for
the
college
d
know
i
beginning
to
think
there
something
seriously
wrong
with
yon
woman
health
she
seemed
anxious
to
consult
me
on
her
own
account
but
when
i
offered
to
sound
her
she
would
hear
of
it
she
cried
keep
it
to
mysell
and
put
her
arm
across
her
breast
as
if
to
keep
me
off
i
do
think
she
hiding
some
complaint
only
a
woman
whose
mind
was
weak
with
disease
could
have
been
so
callous
as
yon
about
her
lassie
oh
her
mind
weak
enough
said
sandy
toddle
it
was
always
that
but
it
only
because
gourlay
has
tyraneezed
her
verra
soul
surprised
however
that
should
be
careless
of
the
girl
he
was
aye
said
to
be
browdened
upon
are
often
like
that
about
said
johnny
coe
they
like
well
enough
to
pet
them
when
they
wee
but
when
once
they
big
they
never
look
the
road
they
on
they
a
very
fine
when
they
pets
but
they
no
sae
fine
when
they
pretty
misses
and
to
tell
the
truth
janet
gourlay
ainything
but
pretty
old
the
bitter
dominie
who
rarely
left
the
studies
in
political
economy
which
he
found
a
solace
for
his
thwarted
powers
happened
to
be
at
the
cross
that
evening
a
brooding
and
taciturn
man
he
said
nothing
till
others
had
their
say
then
he
shook
his
head
they
making
a
great
mistake
he
said
gravely
they
making

the
last
youngster
on

ay
man
dominie

an
infernal
ass
is
he
noat
they
cried
and
pressed
for
his
judgment
at
last
partly
in
real
pedantry
partly
with
humorous
intent
to
puzzle
them
he
delivered
his
astounding
mind
the
fault
of
young
gourlay
quoth
he
is
a
sensory
perceptiveness
in
gross
excess
of
his
intellectuality
they
blinked
and
tried
to
understand
ay

dominie
said
sandy
toddle
that
means
he
an
infernal
cuddy
dominie
does
it
na
dominie
but
had
said
enough
ay
he
said
dryly
there
a
wheen
gey
cuddies
in
barbie
and
he
went
back
to
his
stuffy
little
room
to
study
the
wealth
of

chapter
xvi
the
scion
of
the
house
of
gourlay
was
a
most
untravelled
sprig
when
his
father
packed
him
off
to
the
university
of
the
world
beyond
skeighan
he
had
no
idea
repression
of
his
children
wishes
to
see
something
of
the
world
was
a
feature
of
gourlay
tyranny
less
for
the
sake
of
the
money
which
a
trip
might
cost
though
that
counted
for
something
in
his
refusal
than
for
the
sake
of
asserting
his
authority
wants
to
gang
to
fechars
indeed
let
him
bide
at
home
he
would
growl
and
at
home
the
youngster
had
to
bide
this
had
been
the
more
irksome
to
john
since
most
of
his
companions
in
the
town
were
beginning
to
peer
out
with
their
mammies
and
daddies
to
encourage
them
to
give
their
cubs
a
cast
o
the
world
was
a
rule
with
the
potentates
of
barbie
once
or
twice
a
year
young
hopeful
was
allowed
to
accompany
his
sire
to
fechars
or
poltandie
or
oh
rare
joy
to
the
city
on
the
clyde
to
go
farther
and
get
the
length
of
edinburgh
was
dangerous
because
you
came
back
with
a
halo
of
glory
round
your
head
which
banded
your
fellows
together
in
a
common
attack
on
your
pretensions
it
was
his
lack
of
pretension
to
travel
however
that
banded
them
against
young
gourlay
gunk
and
chaw
are
the
scots
for
a
bitter
and
envious
disappointment
which
shows
itself
in
face
and
eyes
young
gourlay
could
never
conceal
that
envious
look
when
he
heard
of
a
glory
which
he
did
not
share
and
the
youngsters
noted
his
weakness
with
the
unerring
precision
of
the
urchin
to
mark
simple
difference
of
character
now
the
boy
presses
fiendishly
on
an
intimate
discovery
in
the
nature
of
his
friends
both
because
it
gives
him
a
new
and
delightful
feeling
of
power
over
them
and
also
because
he
has
not
learned
charity
from
a
sense
of
his
deficiencies
the
brave
ruffian
having
none
he
is
always
coming
back
to
probe
the
raw
place
and
barbie
boys
were
always
coming
back
to
do
a
gunk
and
play
a
chaw
on
young
gourlay
by
boasting
their
knowledge
of
the
world
winking
at
each
other
the
while
to
observe
his
grinning
anger
they
were
large
on
the
wonders
they
had
seen
and
the
places
they
had
been
to
while
he
grew
small
and
they
saw
it
in
envy
of
their
superiority
even
swipey
broon
had
a
crow
at
him
for
swipey
had
journeyed
in
the
company
of
his
father
to
fechars
yea
even
to
the
and
came
back
with
an
epic
tale
of
his
adventures
he
had
been
in
fifteen
taverns
and
one
hotel
a
temperance
hotel
where
old
brown
bashed
the
proprietor
for
refusing
to
supply
him
gin
one
pepper
ghost
one
wild
beasts
show
one
exhibition
of
the
fattest
woman
on
the
earth
also
in
the
precincts
of
one
jail
where
patrick
brown
was
cruelly
incarcerate
for
wiping
the
floor
with
the
cold
refuser
of
the
gin
criffens
fechars
said
swipey
for
a
twelvemonth
after
stunned
by
the
mere
recollection
of
that
home
of
the
glories
of
the
earth
and
then
he
would
begin
to
expatiate
for
the
benefit
of
young
gourlay
for
swipey
though
his
name
was
the
base
teutonic
brown
had
a
celtic
contempt
for
brute
facts
that
cripple
the
imperial
mind
so
well
did
he
expatiate
that
young
gourlay
would
slink
home
to
his
mother
and
say
yah
even
swipey
broon
has
been
to
fechars
though
my
faither
no
allow
never
mind
dear
she
would
soothe
him
when
once
you
in
the
business
you
gang
and
nut
wan
o
them
has
sic
a
business
to
gang
intill
but
though
he
longed
to
go
here
and
there
for
a
day
that
he
might
be
able
to
boast
of
it
at
home
young
gourlay
felt
that
leaving
barbie
for
good
would
be
a
cutting
of
his
each
feature
of
it
town
and
landward
was
a
crony
of
old
years
in
a
land
like
barbie
of
quick
hill
and
dale
of
tumbled
wood
and
fell
each
facet
of
nature
has
an
individuality
so
separate
and
so
strong
that
if
you
live
with
it
a
little
it
becomes
your
friend
and
a
memory
so
dear
that
you
kiss
the
thought
of
it
in
absence
the
fields
are
not
similar
as
pancakes
they
have
their
difference
each
leaps
to
the
eye
with
a
remembered
and
peculiar
charm
that
is
why
the
heart
of
the
scot
dies
in
flat
southern
lands
he
lives
in
a
vacancy
at
dawn
there
is
no
ben
agray
to
nod
recognition
through
the
mists
and
that
is
why
when
he
gets
north
of
carlisle
he
shouts
with
glee
as
each
remembered
object
sweeps
on
the
sight
yonder
the
nith
with
a
fisherman
jigging
at
his
rod
and
yonder
corsoncon
with
the
mist
on
his
brow
it
is
less
the
totality
of
the
place
than
the
individual
feature
that
pulls
at
the
heart
and
it
was
the
individual
feature
that
pulled
at
young
gourlay
with
intellect
little
or
none
he
had
a
vast
sensational
experience
and
each
aspect
of
barbie
was
working
in
his
blood
and
brain
was
there
ever
a
cross
like
barbie
cross
was
there
ever
a
burn
like
the
lintie
it
was
blithe
and
heartsome
to
go
birling
to
skeighan
in
the
train
it
was
grand
to
jouk
round
barbie
on
the
nichts
at
even
people
whom
he
did
not
know
he
could
locate
with
warm
sure
feelings
of
superiority
if
a
poor
workman
slouched
past
him
on
the
road
he
set
him
down
in
his
heart
as
one
of
that
rotten
crowd
from
the
weaver
vennel
or
the
tinker
wynd
barbie
was
in
subjection
to
the
mind
of
the
son
of
the
important
man
to
dash
about
barbie
in
a
gig
with
a
big
dog
walloping
behind
his
high
about
his
ears
and
the
reek
of
a
meerschaum
pipe
floating
white
and
blue
many
yards
behind
him
jovial
and
sordid
nonsense
about
home
that
had
been
his
ideal
his
father
he
thought
angrily
had
encouraged
the
ideal
and
now
he
forbade
it
like
the
brute
he
was
from
the
earth
in
which
he
was
rooted
so
deeply
his
father
tore
him
to
fling
him
on
a
world
he
had
forbidden
him
to
know
his
heart
presaged
disaster
old
gourlay
would
have
scorned
the
sentimentality
of
seeing
him
off
from
the
station
and
gourlay
was
too
feckless
to
propose
it
for
herself
janet
had
offered
to
convoy
him
but
when
the
afternoon
came
she
was
down
with
a
racking
cold
he
was
alone
as
he
strolled
on
the
platform
a
youth
and
but
for
once
in
his
life
not
a
swaggerer
though
the
chance
to
swagger
was
unique
he
was
pointed
out
as
young
gourlay
off
to
the
college
but
he
had
no
pleasure
in
the
rôle
for
his
heart
was
in
his
boots
he
took
the
slow
train
to
skeighan
where
he
boarded
the
express
few
sensational
experiences
were
unknown
to
his
mind
and
he
knew
the
animation
of
railway
travelling
coming
back
from
skeighan
in
an
empty
compartment
on
nights
of
the
past
he
had
sometimes
shouted
and
stamped
and
banged
the
cushions
till
the
dust
flew
in
mere
joy
of
his
rush
through
the
air
the
constant
rattle
the
noise
getting
at
his
nerves
as
they
get
at
the
nerves
of
savages
and
englishmen
on
bank
holidays
but
any
animation
of
the
kind
which
he
felt
was
soon
expelled
by
the
slow
uneasiness
welling
through
his
blood
he
had
no
eager
delight
in
the
unknown
country
rushing
past
it
inspired
him
with
fear
he
thought
with
a
feeble
smile
of
what
mysie
monk
said
when
they
took
her
at
the
age
of
sixty
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
to
the
top
of
milmannoch
hill
eh
said
mysie
looking
round
her
in
amaze
eh
sirs
it
a
lairge
place
the
world
when
you
see
it
all
gourlay
smiled
because
he
had
the
same
thought
but
feebly
because
he
was
cowering
at
the
bigness
of
the
world
folded
nooks
in
the
hills
swept
past
enclosing
their
lonely
farms
then
the
open
straths
where
autumnal
waters
gave
a
pale
gleam
to
the
sky
sodden
moors
stretched
away
in
vast
patient
loneliness
then
a
gray
smear
of
rain
blotted
the
world
penning
him
in
with
his
dejection
he
seemed
to
be
rushing
through
unseen
space
with
no
companion
but
his
own
foreboding
where
are
you
going
to
asked
his
mind
and
the
wheels
of
the
train
repeated
the
question
all
the
way
to
edinburgh
jerking
it
out
in
two
short
lines
and
a
long
one
where
are
you
going
to
where
are
you
going
to
ha
ha
gourlay
where
are
you
going
to
it
was
the
same
sensitiveness
to
physical
impression
which
won
him
to
barbie
that
repelled
him
from
the
outer
world
the
scenes
round
barbie
so
vividly
impressed
were
his
friends
because
he
had
known
them
from
his
birth
he
was
a
somebody
in
their
midst
and
had
mastered
their
familiarity
they
were
the
ministers
of
his
mind
those
other
scenes
were
his
foes
because
realizing
them
morbidly
in
relation
to
himself
he
was
cowed
by
their
big
indifference
to
him
and
felt
puny
a
nobody
before
them
and
he
could
not
pass
them
like
more
manly
and
more
callous
minds
they
came
burdening
in
on
him
whether
he
would
or
no
neither
could
he
get
above
them
except
when
lording
it
at
barbie
he
had
never
a
quick
reaction
of
the
mind
on
what
he
saw
it
possessed
him
not
he
it
about
twilight
when
the
rain
had
ceased
his
train
was
brought
up
with
a
jerk
between
the
stations
while
the
rattle
and
bang
continued
it
seemed
not
unnatural
to
young
gourlay
though
depressing
to
be
whirling
through
the
darkening
land
it
went
past
like
a
panorama
in
a
dream
but
in
the
dead
pause
following
the
noise
he
thought
it
queer
to
be
sitting
here
in
the
intense
quietude
and
looking
at
a
strange
and
unfamiliar
scene
planted
in
its
midst
by
a
miracle
of
speed
and
gazing
at
it
closely
through
a
window
two
ploughmen
from
the
farmhouse
near
the
line
were
unyoking
at
the
end
of
the
croft
he
could
hear
the
muddy
noise
splorroch
is
the
scotch
of
it
made
by
the
big
hoofs
on
the
squashy
bauldy
was
the
name
of
the
shorter
ploughman
so
yelled
to
by
his
mate
and
two
of
the
horses
were
prince
and
rab
just
like
a
pair
in
loranogie
stable
in
the
curtainless
window
of
the
farmhouse
shone
a
leaping
flame
not
the
steady
glow
of
a
lamp
but
the
tossing
brightness
of
a
fire
and
thought
he
to
himself
getting
the
porridge
for
the
men
he
had
a
vision
of
the
woman
stirring
in
the
meal
and
of
the
homely
interior
in
the
dancing
firelight
he
wondered
who
the
folk
were
and
would
have
liked
to
know
them
yes
it
was
queer
he
thought
that
he
who
left
barbie
only
a
few
hours
ago
should
be
in
intimate
momentary
touch
with
a
place
and
people
he
had
never
seen
before
the
train
seemed
arrested
by
a
spell
that
he
might
get
his
vivid
impression
when
ensconced
in
his
room
that
evening
he
had
a
brighter
outlook
on
the
world
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
lights
burning
its
shabbiness
was
unrevealed
after
the
whirling
strangeness
of
the
day
he
was
glad
to
be
in
a
place
that
was
his
own
here
at
least
was
a
corner
of
earth
of
which
he
was
master
it
reassured
him
the
firelight
dancing
on
the
tea
things
was
pleasant
and
homely
and
the
enclosing
cosiness
shut
out
the
black
roaring
world
that
threatened
to
engulf
his
personality
his
spirits
rose
ever
ready
to
jump
at
a
trifle
the
morrow
however
was
the
first
of
his
lugubrious
time
if
he
had
been
an
able
man
he
might
have
found
a
place
in
his
classes
to
console
him
many
youngsters
are
conscious
of
a
vast
depression
when
entering
the
portals
of
a
university
they
feel
themselves
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
garnered
in
the
solid
walls
they
envy
alike
the
smiling
sureness
of
the
genial
charlatan
to
whom
professors
are
a
set
of
fools
and
the
easy
mastery
of
the
man
of
brains
they
have
a
cowering
sense
of
their
own
inefficiency
but
the
feeling
of
uneasiness
presently
disappears
the
first
shivering
dip
is
soon
forgotten
by
the
hearty
breaster
of
the
waves
but
ere
you
breast
the
waves
you
must
swim
and
to
swim
through
the
sea
of
learning
was
more
than
gourlay
could
accomplish
his
mind
finding
no
solace
in
work
was
left
to
prey
upon
itself
if
he
had
been
the
ass
total
and
complete
he
might
have
loafed
in
the
comfortable
haze
which
surrounds
the
average
intelligence
and
cushions
it
against
the
world
but
in
gourlay
was
a
rawness
of
nerve
a
sensitiveness
to
physical
impression
which
kept
him
fretting
and
stewing
and
never
allowed
him
to
lapse
on
a
sluggish
indifference
though
he
could
not
understand
things
he
could
not
escape
them
they
thrust
themselves
forward
on
his
notice
we
hear
of
poor
genius
cursed
with
perceptions
which
it
ca
express
poor
gourlay
was
cursed
with
impressions
which
he
could
intellectualize
with
little
power
of
thought
he
had
a
vast
power
of
observation
and
as
everything
he
observed
in
edinburgh
was
offensive
and
depressing
he
was
constantly
depressed
the
more
because
he
could
not
understand
at
barbie
his
life
though
equally
void
of
mental
interest
was
solaced
by
surroundings
which
he
loved
in
edinburgh
his
surroundings
were
appalling
to
his
timid
mind
there
was
a
greengrocer
shop
at
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
he
lodged
and
he
never
passed
it
without
being
conscious
of
its
trodden
and
decaying
leaves
they
were
enough
to
make
his
morning
foul
the
woman
who
had
to
handle
carrots
with
her
frozen
fingers
was
less
wretched
than
he
who
saw
her
and
thought
of
her
after
he
went
by
a
thousand
such
impressions
came
boring
in
upon
his
mind
and
made
him
squirm
he
could
not
toss
them
aside
like
the
callous
and
manly
he
could
not
see
them
in
their
due
relation
and
think
them
unimportant
like
the
able
they
were
always
recurring
and
suggesting
woe
if
he
fled
to
his
room
he
was
followed
by
his
morbid
sense
of
an
unpleasant
world
he
conceived
a
rankling
hatred
of
the
four
walls
wherein
he
had
to
live
heavy
biblical
pictures
in
frames
of
gleaming
black
like
the
splinters
of
a
hearse
were
hung
against
a
dark
ground
every
time
gourlay
raised
his
head
he
scowled
at
them
with
eyes
of
gloom
it
was
curious
that
hating
his
room
he
was
loath
to
go
to
bed
he
got
a
habit
of
sitting
till
three
in
the
morning
staring
at
the
dead
fire
in
sullen
apathy
he
was
sitting
at
nine
one
evening
wondering
if
there
was
no
means
of
escape
from
the
wretched
life
he
had
to
lead
when
he
received
a
letter
from
jock
allan
asking
him
to
come
and
dine
chapter
xvii
that
dinner
was
a
in
young
gourlay
career
it
is
lucky
that
a
letter
describing
it
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
patient
chronicler
it
was
sent
by
young
jimmy
wilson
to
his
mother
as
it
gives
an
idea
which
is
slightly
mistaken
of
jock
allan
and
an
idea
which
is
very
unmistakable
of
young
wilson
it
is
here
presented
in
the
place
of
pride
it
were
a
pity
not
to
give
a
human
document
of
this
kind
all
the
honour
in
one
power
dear
mother
said
the
wee
sma
scoatchman
so
the
hearty
allan
dubbed
him
dear
mother
i
just
write
to
inform
you
that
i
been
out
to
a
grand
dinner
at
jock
allan
he
met
me
on
princes
street
and
made
a
great
d
out
on
thursday
night
and
dine
with
me
says
he
in
his
big
way
so
here
i
went
out
to
see
him
i
can
tell
you
he
a
warmer
i
never
saw
a
man
eat
so
much
in
all
my
born
days
but
i
suppose
he
would
be
having
more
on
his
table
than
usual
to
show
off
a
bit
knowing
us
barbie
boys
would
be
writing
home
about
it
all
and
drink
d
know
he
began
with
a
whole
half
tumbler
of
whisky
and
how
many
more
he
had
i
really
should
like
to
say
and
he
must
be
used
to
it
too
for
it
seemed
to
have
no
effect
on
him
whatever
and
then
he
smoked
and
smoked
two
great
big
cigars
after
we
had
finished
eating
and
then
it
says
he
he
an
awful
man
to
swear
it
he
says
no
satisfaction
in
cigars
i
must
have
a
pipe
and
he
actually
smoked
pipes
before
i
came
away
i
noticed
the
cigars
were
called
best
quality
and
when
i
was
in
last
saturday
night
getting
an
ounce
of
shag
at
the
wee
shoppie
round
the
corner
i
asked
the
price
of
estorellas
a
piece
said
the
bodie
just
imagine
jock
allan
smoking
and
not
being
satisfied
he
up
in
the
world
since
he
used
to
shaw
turnips
at
loranogie
for
sixpence
a
day
but
he
come
down
as
quick
if
he
keeps
on
at
yon
rate
he
made
a
great
phrase
with
me
but
though
it
keeps
down
one
weekly
bill
to
get
a
meal
like
yon
i
declare
i
was
hungry
for
two
days
for
all
that
i
go
very
little
about
him
he
be
the
kind
that
borrows
money
very
fast
one
of
those
ones
criticism
like
that
is
a
boomerang
that
comes
back
to
hit
the
emitting
skull
with
a
hint
of
its
kindred
woodenness
it
reveals
the
writer
more
than
the
written
of
allan
was
a
bigger
man
than
you
would
gather
from
wilson
account
of
his
gargantuan
revelry
he
had
a
genius
for
mathematics
a
gift
which
crops
up
like
music
in
the
most
unexpected
corners
and
from
and
herd
he
had
become
an
actuary
in
auld
reekie
wilson
had
no
need
to
be
afraid
the
meagre
fool
for
his
host
could
have
bought
him
and
sold
him
allan
had
been
in
love
with
young
gourlay
mother
when
she
herself
was
a
gay
young
fliskie
at
tenshillingland
but
his
little
romance
was
soon
ended
when
gourlay
came
and
whisked
her
away
but
she
remained
the
one
romance
of
his
life
now
in
his
gross
and
jovial
middle
age
he
idealized
her
in
memory
a
sentimentalist
of
course
he
was
scotch
he
never
saw
her
in
her
scraggy
misery
to
be
disillusioned
to
him
she
was
still
the
wee
bit
lairdie
dochter
a
vision
that
had
dawned
on
his
wretched
boyhood
a
pleasant
and
pathetic
memory
and
for
that
reason
he
had
a
curious
kindness
to
her
boy
that
was
why
he
introduced
him
to
his
boon
companions
he
thought
he
was
doing
him
a
good
turn
it
was
true
that
allan
made
a
phrase
with
a
withered
wisp
of
humanity
like
young
wilson
not
that
he
failed
to
see
through
him
for
he
christened
him
a
dried
but
allan
like
most
scots
far
from
their
native
place
saw
it
through
a
veil
of
sentiment
harsher
features
that
would
have
been
to
his
mind
if
he
had
never
left
it
disappeared
from
view
and
left
only
the
finer
qualities
bright
within
his
memory
and
idealizing
the
place
he
idealized
its
sons
to
him
they
had
a
value
not
their
own
just
because
they
knew
the
brig
and
the
burn
and
the
brae
and
had
sat
upon
the
school
benches
he
would
have
welcomed
a
dog
from
barbie
it
was
from
a
like
generous
emotion
that
he
greeted
the
bodies
so
warmly
on
his
visits
home
he
thought
they
were
as
pleased
to
see
him
as
he
was
to
see
them
but
they
imputed
false
motives
to
his
hearty
greetings
even
as
they
shook
his
hand
the
mean
ones
would
think
to
themselves
what
does
he
mean
by
this
now
what
he
up
till
no
doubt
he
be
wanting
something
off
me
they
could
not
understand
the
gusto
with
which
the
returned
exile
cried
ay
man
jock
tamson
and
how
are
ye
they
thought
such
warmth
must
have
a
sinister
a
scot
revisiting
his
native
place
ought
to
walk
very
quietly
for
the
parish
is
sizing
him
up
there
were
two
things
to
be
said
against
allan
and
two
only
unless
of
course
you
consider
drink
an
objection
wit
with
him
was
less
the
moment
glittering
flash
than
the
anecdotal
bang
it
was
a
fine
old
crusted
blend
which
he
stored
in
the
cellars
of
his
mind
to
bring
forth
on
suitable
occasions
as
as
his
wine
and
it
tickled
his
vanity
to
have
a
crowd
of
admiring
youngsters
round
him
to
whom
he
might
retail
his
anecdotes
and
play
the
brilliant
he
had
cronies
of
his
own
years
and
he
was
lordly
and
jovial
amongst
them
yet
he
wanted
another
he
was
one
of
those
bachelors
who
like
a
train
of
youngsters
behind
them
whom
they
favour
in
return
for
homage
the
wealthy
man
who
had
been
a
peasant
lad
delighted
to
act
the
jovial
host
to
sons
of
petty
magnates
from
his
home
batch
after
batch
as
they
came
up
to
college
were
drawn
around
him
partly
because
their
homage
pleased
him
and
partly
because
he
loved
anything
whatever
that
came
out
of
barbie
there
was
no
harm
in
allan
though
when
his
face
was
in
repose
you
saw
the
look
in
his
eye
at
times
of
a
man
defrauding
his
soul
a
robustious
young
fellow
of
sense
and
brains
would
have
found
in
this
lover
of
books
and
a
bottle
not
a
bad
comrade
but
he
was
the
worst
of
cronies
for
a
weak
swaggerer
like
gourlay
for
gourlay
admiring
the
older
man
jovial
power
was
led
on
to
imitate
his
faults
to
think
them
virtues
and
a
credit
and
he
lacked
the
clear
cool
head
that
kept
allan
faults
from
flying
away
with
him
at
dinner
that
night
there
were
several
braw
braw
lads
of
barbie
water
there
were
tarmillan
the
doctor
a
son
of
irrendavie
logan
the
cashier
tozer
the
englishman
old
partan
a
guileless
and
inquiring
mind
and
half
a
dozen
students
raw
from
the
west
the
students
were
of
the
kind
that
goes
up
to
college
with
the
hayseed
sticking
in
its
hair
two
are
in
a
colonial
cabinet
now
two
are
in
the
poorhouse
so
they
go
tarmillan
was
the
last
to
arrive
he
came
in
sucking
his
thumb
into
which
he
had
driven
a
splinter
while
conducting
an
experiment
i
a
morbid
horror
of
lockjaw
he
explained
i
never
get
a
jag
from
a
pin
but
i
see
myself
in
the
shape
of
a
hoop
semicircular
with
my
head
on
one
end
of
a
table
my
heels
on
the
other
and
a
doctor
standing
on
my
navel
trying
to
reduce
the
curvature
gosh
said
partan
who
was
a
literal
fool
is
that
the
treatment
they
purshoo
that
the
treatment
said
tarmillan
sizing
up
his
man
oh
it
a
queer
thing
lockjaw
i
remember
when
i
was
in
tibet
one
of
our
carriers
who
died
of
lockjaw
had
such
a
circumbendibus
in
his
body
that
we
froze
him
and
made
him
the
hoop
of
a
bucket
to
carry
our
water
in
you
see
he
was
a
thin
bit
man
and
iron
was
scarce
ay
man
cried
partan
you
been
in
tibet
often
waved
tarmillan
often
i
used
to
go
there
every
summer
partan
who
liked
to
extend
his
geographical
knowledge
would
have
talked
of
tibet
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
tarmie
would
have
told
him
news
but
allan
broke
in
how
the
book
tarmillan
he
inquired
tarmillan
was
engaged
on
a
treatise
which
those
who
are
competent
to
judge
consider
the
best
thing
of
its
kind
ever
written
oh
do
ask
me
he
writhed
man
it
an
irksome
thing
to
write
and
to
be
asked
about
it
makes
you
squirm
it
almost
as
offensive
to
ask
a
man
when
his
book
will
be
out
as
to
ask
a
woman
when
she
be
delivered
i
glad
you
invited
me
to
get
away
from
the
confounded
thing
it
become
a
blasted
tyrant
a
big
work
a
mistake
it
a
monster
that
devours
the
brain
i
neglect
my
other
work
for
that
fellow
of
mine
he
bags
everything
i
think
i
never
light
on
a
new
thing
but
i
cry
an
idea
for
the
book
if
you
are
engaged
on
a
big
subject
all
your
thinking
works
into
it
or
out
of
it
said
logan
but
that
a
swashing
way
of
putting
it
it
the
danger
of
the
aphorism
said
allan
that
it
states
too
much
in
trying
to
be
tozer
what
do
you
think
i
never
was
engaged
on
a
big
subject
sniffed
tozer
we
aware
o
that
said
tarmillan
tozer
went
under
and
tarmillan
had
the
table
allan
was
proud
of
him
courage
is
the
great
thing
said
he
it
often
succeeds
by
the
mere
show
of
it
it
the
timid
man
that
a
dog
bites
run
him
and
he
runs
he
was
speaking
to
himself
rather
than
the
table
admiring
the
courage
that
had
snubbed
tozer
with
a
word
but
his
musing
remark
rang
a
bell
in
young
gourlay
by
jove
he
had
thought
that
himself
so
he
had
he
was
a
hollow
thing
he
knew
but
a
buckram
pretence
prevented
the
world
from
piercing
to
his
hollowness
the
son
of
his
courageous
sire
whom
he
equally
admired
and
feared
had
learned
to
play
the
game
of
bluff
a
bold
front
was
half
the
battle
he
had
worked
out
his
little
theory
and
it
was
with
a
shock
of
pleasure
the
timid
youngster
heard
great
allan
give
it
forth
he
burned
to
let
him
know
that
he
had
thought
that
too
to
the
youngsters
fat
of
face
and
fluffy
of
its
circling
down
the
talk
was
a
banquet
of
the
gods
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
they
heard
ideas
such
as
they
were
flung
round
them
royally
they
yearned
to
show
that
they
were
thinkers
too
and
gourlay
was
fired
with
the
rest
i
heard
a
very
good
one
the
other
day
from
old
bauldy
johnston
said
allan
opening
his
usual
wallet
of
stories
when
the
dinner
was
in
full
swing
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
evening
i
heard
a
good
one
was
the
invariable
keynote
of
his
talk
if
you
displayed
no
wish
to
hear
the
good
one
he
was
huffed
bauldy
was
up
in
edinburgh
he
went
on
and
i
met
him
near
the
scott
monument
and
took
him
to
lockhart
for
a
dram
you
remember
what
a
friend
he
used
to
be
of
old
will
overton
i
was
aware
that
will
was
dead
till
bauldy
told
me
was
a
great
fellow
my
friend
he
rang
out
in
yon
deep
voice
of
his
of
his
maker
was
wet
in
the
clay
of
man
it
made
a
quiver
go
down
my
spine
oh
bauldy
has
been
a
kenned
for
the
last
forty
year
said
tarmillan
but
every
other
scots
peasant
has
the
gift
to
hear
englishmen
talk
you
would
think
carlyle
was
unique
for
the
word
that
sends
the
picture
home
they
give
the
man
the
credit
of
his
race
but
i
heard
fifty
things
better
than
man
in
the
stable
on
a
wat
day
in
hairst
fifty
things
better
from
men
just
sitting
on
the
and
chowing
beans
i
know
a
better
one
than
that
said
allan
tarmillan
had
told
no
story
you
observe
but
allan
was
so
accustomed
to
saying
i
know
a
better
one
than
that
that
it
escaped
him
before
he
was
aware
i
remember
when
bauldy
went
off
to
paris
on
the
spree
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
when
he
came
back
for
he
was
rather
ashamed
o
the
outburst
but
the
bodies
were
keen
to
hear
the
incense
like
in
notre
dame
said
johnny
coe
with
his
een
big
stink
said
bauldy
i
can
cap
that
with
a
better
one
still
said
tarmillan
who
was
to
be
done
by
any
man
i
was
with
bauldy
when
he
quarrelled
tam
gibb
of
a
yelling
ass
and
he
threatened
bauldy
oh
he
would
do
this
and
he
would
do
that
and
he
would
do
the
other
thing
ye
would
ye
threaten
me
cried
bauldy
gar
your
brains
jaup
red
to
the
heavens
and
i
to
god
sirs
a
nervous
man
looked
up
to
see
if
the
clouds
werena
spattered
with
the
gore
tozer
cleared
a
sarcastic
windpipe
why
do
you
clear
your
throat
like
that
said
tarmillan
like
a
craw
with
the
croup
on
a
bare
branch
against
a
gray
sky
in
november
if
i
had
a
throat
like
yours
i
cut
it
and
be
done
i
wonder
what
the
cause
of
that
extraordinary
vividness
in
the
speech
of
the
scotch
peasantry
said
allan
more
to
keep
the
blades
from
bickering
than
from
any
wish
to
know
it
comes
from
a
power
of
seeing
things
vividly
inside
your
mind
said
a
voice
timorous
and
wheezy
away
down
the
table
what
cockerel
was
this
crowing
they
turned
and
beheld
the
blushing
gourlay
but
tarmillan
and
tozer
were
at
it
again
and
he
was
snubbed
jimmy
wilson
sniggered
and
the
other
youngsters
enjoyed
his
discomfiture
huh
what
right
has
to
set
up
his
pipe
his
shirt
stuck
to
his
back
he
would
have
liked
the
ground
to
open
and
swallow
him
he
gulped
a
huge
swill
of
whisky
to
cover
his
vexation
and
oh
the
mighty
difference
a
sudden
courage
flooded
his
veins
he
turned
with
a
scowl
on
wilson
and
what
the
devil
are
sniggering
at
he
growled
logan
the
only
senior
who
marked
the
byplay
thought
him
a
hardy
young
spunkie
the
moment
the
whisky
had
warmed
the
cockles
of
his
heart
gourlay
ceased
to
care
a
rap
for
the
sniggerers
drink
deadened
his
nervous
perception
of
the
critics
on
his
right
and
left
and
set
him
free
to
follow
his
idea
undisturbed
it
was
an
idea
he
had
long
cherished
being
one
of
the
few
that
ever
occurred
to
him
he
rarely
made
phrases
himself
though
curiously
enough
his
father
often
did
without
knowing
it
the
harsh
grind
of
his
character
producing
a
flash
but
gourlay
was
aware
of
his
uncanny
gift
of
visualization
or
of
seeing
things
in
the
inside
of
his
head
as
he
called
it
and
vanity
prompted
the
inference
that
this
was
the
faculty
that
sprang
the
metaphor
his
theory
was
now
clear
and
eloquent
before
him
he
was
realizing
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
with
a
sudden
joy
in
the
discovery
the
effect
of
whisky
to
unloose
the
brain
sentences
went
hurling
through
his
brain
with
a
fluency
that
thrilled
if
he
had
the
ear
of
the
company
now
he
had
the
drink
to
hearten
him
he
would
show
wilson
and
the
rest
that
he
was
such
a
blasted
fool
in
a
room
by
himself
he
would
have
spouted
to
the
empty
air
some
such
point
he
had
reached
in
the
hurrying
jumble
of
his
thoughts
when
allan
addressed
him
allan
did
not
mean
his
guest
to
be
snubbed
he
was
a
gentleman
at
heart
not
a
cad
like
tozer
and
this
boy
was
the
son
of
a
girl
whose
laugh
he
remembered
in
the
gloamings
at
tenshillingland
i
beg
your
pardon
john
he
said
in
heavy
benevolence
he
had
reached
that
stage
i
beg
your
pardon
i
afraid
you
was
interrupted
gourlay
felt
his
heart
a
lump
in
his
throat
but
he
rushed
into
speech
metaphor
comes
from
the
power
of
seeing
things
in
the
inside
of
your
head
said
the
unconscious
disciple
of
aristotle
seeing
them
so
vivid
that
you
see
the
likeness
between
them
when
bauldy
johnston
said
of
his
maker
was
wet
in
the
clay
of
him
he
the
print
of
a
thumb
in
wet
clay
and
he
the
almighty
making
a
man
out
of
mud
the
way
he
used
to
do
in
the
garden
of
eden
lang
syne
so
bauldy
flashed
the
two
ideas
together
and
the
metaphor
sprang
a
man
never
make
phrases
unless
he
can
see
things
in
the
middle
of
his
brain
can
see
things
in
the
middle
of
my
brain
he
went
on
cockily
anything
i
want
to
i
do
need
to
shut
my
eyes
either
they
just
come
up
before
me
man
you
young
to
have
noticed
these
things
john
said
jock
allan
i
never
reasoned
it
out
before
but
i
sure
you
in
the
right
he
spoke
more
warmly
than
he
felt
because
gourlay
had
flushed
and
panted
and
stammered
in
spite
of
inspiring
bold
john
barleycorn
while
airing
his
little
theory
and
allan
wanted
to
cover
him
but
gourlay
took
it
as
a
tribute
to
his
towering
mind
oh
but
he
was
the
proud
mannikin
pass
the
watter
he
said
to
jimmy
wilson
and
jimmy
passed
it
meekly
logan
took
a
fancy
to
gourlay
on
the
spot
he
was
a
slow
sly
cosy
man
with
a
sideward
laugh
in
his
eye
a
humid
gleam
and
because
his
blood
was
so
genial
and
so
slow
he
liked
to
make
up
to
brisk
young
fellows
whose
wilder
outbursts
might
amuse
him
they
quickened
his
sluggish
blood
no
bad
fellow
and
in
his
heavy
way
he
was
what
the
scotch
call
a
slug
for
the
drink
a
slug
for
the
drink
is
a
man
who
soaks
and
never
succumbs
logan
was
the
more
dangerous
a
crony
on
that
account
remaining
sober
while
others
grew
drunk
he
was
always
ready
for
another
dram
always
ready
with
an
oily
chuckle
for
the
sploring
nonsense
of
his
satellites
he
would
see
them
home
in
the
small
hours
taking
no
mean
advantage
over
them
never
scorning
them
because
they
could
carry
it
only
laughing
at
their
daft
vagaries
and
next
day
he
would
gurgle
was
screwed
last
night
and
man
if
you
had
heard
his
talk
logan
had
enjoyed
it
he
hated
to
drink
by
himself
and
liked
a
splurging
youngster
with
whom
to
go
the
rounds
he
was
attracted
to
gourlay
by
the
manly
way
he
tossed
his
drink
and
by
the
false
fire
it
put
into
him
but
he
made
no
immediate
advance
he
sat
smiling
in
creeshy
benevolence
beaming
on
gourlay
but
saying
nothing
when
the
party
was
ended
however
he
made
up
to
him
going
through
the
door
i
glad
to
have
met
you
gourlay
said
he
wo
you
come
round
to
the
howff
for
a
while
the
howff
said
gourlay
yes
said
logan
have
ye
heard
it
a
snug
bit
house
where
some
of
the
west
country
billies
forgather
for
a
nicht
at
oh
nothing
to
speak
of
ye
know
just
a
dram
and
a
joke
to
pass
the
time
now
and
then
aha
laughed
gourlay
there
worse
than
a
drink
by
jove
it
puts
smeddum
in
your
blood
logan
nipped
the
guard
of
his
arm
in
heavy
playfulness
and
led
him
to
the
howff
chapter
xviii
young
gourlay
had
found
a
means
of
escaping
from
his
foolish
mind
by
the
beginning
of
his
second
session
he
was
as
able
a
toper
as
a
publican
could
wish
the
somewhat
sordid
joviality
of
allan
ring
their
that
were
somewhat
crude
appeared
to
him
the
very
acme
of
social
intercourse
to
emulate
logan
and
allan
was
his
aim
but
drink
appealed
to
him
in
many
ways
besides
now
when
his
too
apprehensive
nerves
were
frightened
by
bugbears
in
his
lonely
room
he
could
be
off
to
the
howff
and
escape
them
and
drink
inspired
him
with
false
courage
to
sustain
his
pose
as
a
hardy
rollicker
he
had
acquired
a
kind
of
prestige
since
the
night
of
allan
party
and
two
of
the
fellows
whom
he
met
there
armstrong
and
gillespie
became
his
friends
at
college
and
the
howff
he
swaggered
before
them
as
he
had
swaggered
at
school
both
in
barbie
and
skeighan
and
now
there
was
no
swipey
broon
to
cut
him
over
the
coxcomb
armstrong
and
gillespie
though
they
saw
through
him
let
him
run
on
for
he
was
not
bad
fun
when
he
was
splurging
he
found
too
when
with
his
cronies
that
drink
unlocked
his
mind
and
gave
a
free
flow
to
his
ideas
nervous
men
are
often
impotent
of
speech
from
very
excess
of
perception
they
realize
not
merely
what
they
mean
to
say
but
with
the
nervous
antennæ
of
their
minds
they
feel
the
attitude
of
every
auditor
distracted
by
lateral
perceptions
from
the
point
ahead
they
blunder
where
blunter
minds
would
go
forward
undismayed
that
was
the
experience
of
young
gourlay
if
he
tried
to
talk
freely
when
sober
he
always
grew
confused
but
drink
deadened
the
outer
rim
of
his
perception
and
left
it
the
clearer
in
the
middle
for
its
concentration
in
plainer
language
when
he
was
drunk
he
was
less
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
and
free
of
that
fear
he
was
a
better
speaker
he
was
driven
to
drink
then
by
every
weakness
of
his
character
as
nervous
hypochondriac
as
swaggerer
as
a
dullard
requiring
stimulus
he
found
that
drink
to
use
his
own
language
gave
him
smeddum
with
his
second
year
he
began
the
study
of
philosophy
and
that
added
to
his
woes
he
had
nerves
to
feel
the
big
conundrum
but
not
the
brains
to
solve
it
small
blame
to
him
for
that
since
philosophers
have
cursed
each
other
black
in
the
face
over
it
for
the
last
five
thousand
years
but
it
worried
him
the
strange
and
sinister
detail
of
the
world
that
had
always
been
a
horror
to
his
mind
became
more
horrible
beneath
the
stimulus
of
futile
thought
but
whisky
was
the
mighty
cure
he
was
the
gentleman
who
gained
notoriety
on
a
memorable
occasion
by
exclaiming
metaphysics
be
damned
let
us
drink
omar
and
other
bards
have
expressed
the
same
conclusion
in
more
dulcet
wise
but
gourlay
was
equally
sincere
how
sincere
is
another
question
curiously
an
utterance
of
auld
tam
one
of
his
professors
half
confirmed
him
in
his
evil
ways
i
am
speaking
now
said
tam
of
the
comfort
of
a
true
philosophy
less
of
its
higher
aspect
than
its
comfort
to
the
mind
of
man
physically
each
man
is
highest
on
the
globe
intellectually
the
philosopher
alone
dominates
the
world
to
him
are
only
two
entities
that
matter
himself
and
the
eternal
or
if
another
it
is
his
whom
serving
he
serves
the
ultimate
of
being
but
he
is
master
of
the
outer
world
the
mind
indeed
in
its
first
blank
outlook
on
life
is
terrified
by
the
demoniac
force
of
nature
and
the
swarming
misery
of
man
by
the
vast
totality
of
things
the
cold
remoteness
of
the
starry
heavens
and
the
threat
of
the
devouring
seas
it
is
puny
in
their
midst
gourlay
woke
up
and
the
sweat
broke
on
him
great
heaven
had
tam
been
through
it
too
at
that
stage
quoth
the
wise
man
the
mind
is
dispersed
in
a
thousand
perceptions
and
a
thousand
fears
there
is
no
central
greatness
in
the
soul
it
is
assailed
by
terrors
which
men
sunk
in
the
material
never
seem
to
feel
phenomena
uninformed
by
thought
bewilder
and
depress
just
like
me
thought
gourlay
and
listened
with
a
thrilling
interest
because
it
was
just
like
him
but
the
labyrinth
said
tam
with
a
ring
in
his
voice
as
of
one
who
knew
the
labyrinth
can
not
appal
the
man
who
has
found
a
clue
to
its
windings
a
mind
that
has
attained
to
thought
lives
in
itself
and
the
world
becomes
its
slave
its
formerly
distracted
powers
rally
home
it
is
central
possessing
not
possessed
the
world
no
longer
frightens
being
understood
its
sinister
features
are
accidents
that
will
pass
away
and
they
gradually
cease
to
be
observed
for
real
thinkers
know
the
value
of
a
wise
indifference
and
that
is
why
they
are
often
the
most
genial
men
unworried
by
the
transient
they
can
smile
and
wait
sure
of
their
eternal
aim
the
man
to
whom
the
infinite
beckons
is
not
to
be
driven
from
his
mystic
quest
by
the
ambush
of
a
temporal
fear
there
is
no
fear
it
has
ceased
to
exist
that
is
the
comfort
of
a
true
philosophy
if
a
man
accepts
it
not
merely
mechanically
from
another
but
feels
it
in
breath
and
blood
and
every
atom
of
his
being
with
a
warm
surety
in
his
heart
he
is
undaunted
by
the
outer
world
that
gentlemen
is
what
thought
can
do
for
a
man
by
jove
thought
gourlay
that
what
whisky
does
for
me
and
that
on
a
lower
level
was
what
whisky
did
he
had
no
conception
of
what
tam
really
meant
there
were
people
indeed
who
used
to
think
that
tam
never
knew
what
he
meant
himself
they
were
as
little
able
as
gourlay
to
appreciate
the
mystic
through
the
radiant
haze
of
whose
mind
thoughts
loomed
on
you
sudden
and
big
like
mountain
tops
in
a
sunny
mist
the
grander
for
their
dimness
but
gourlay
though
he
could
not
understand
felt
the
fortitude
of
whisky
was
somehow
akin
to
the
fortitude
described
in
the
increased
vitality
it
gave
he
was
able
to
tread
down
the
world
if
he
walked
on
a
wretched
day
in
a
wretched
street
when
he
happened
to
be
sober
his
mind
was
hither
and
yon
in
a
thousand
perceptions
and
a
thousand
fears
fastening
to
and
fastened
to
each
squalid
thing
around
but
with
whisky
humming
in
his
blood
he
paced
onward
in
a
happy
dream
the
wretched
puddles
by
the
way
the
frowning
rookeries
where
misery
squalled
the
melancholy
noises
of
the
street
were
passed
unheeded
by
his
distracted
powers
rallied
home
he
was
concentrate
his
own
man
again
the
hero
of
his
musing
mind
for
like
all
weak
men
of
a
vivid
fancy
he
was
constantly
framing
dramas
of
which
he
was
the
towering
lord
the
weakling
who
never
downed
men
in
reality
was
always
downing
them
in
thought
his
imaginary
triumphs
consoled
him
for
his
actual
rebuffs
as
he
walked
in
a
tipsy
dream
he
was
standing
up
to
somebody
hurling
his
father
phrases
at
him
making
short
work
of
if
imagination
paled
the
nearest
tavern
supplied
a
remedy
and
flushed
it
to
a
radiant
glow
whereupon
he
had
become
the
master
of
his
world
and
not
its
slave
just
imagine
he
thought
whisky
doing
for
me
what
philosophy
seems
to
do
for
tam
it
a
wonderful
thing
the
drink
his
second
session
wore
on
and
when
near
its
close
tam
gave
out
the
subject
for
the
raeburn
the
raeburn
was
a
poor
enough
prize
a
few
books
for
an
essay
in
the
picturesque
but
it
had
a
peculiar
interest
for
the
folk
of
barbie
twenty
years
ago
it
was
won
four
years
in
succession
by
men
from
the
valley
and
the
unusual
run
of
luck
fixed
it
in
their
minds
thereafter
when
an
unsuccessful
candidate
returned
to
his
home
he
was
sure
to
be
asked
very
pointedly
who
won
the
raeburn
the
year
to
rub
into
him
their
perception
that
he
at
least
had
been
a
failure
a
bodie
would
dander
slowly
up
saying
ay
man
ye
won
hame
then
having
mused
awhile
would
casually
ask
who
won
the
raeburn
the
year
oh
it
was
a
perthshire
man
it
used
to
come
our
airt
but
we
seem
to
have
lost
the
knack
oh
yes
sir
barbie
bred
writers
in
those
days
but
the
breed
seems
to
have
decayed
then
he
would
murmur
dreamily
as
if
talking
to
himself
jock
goudie
was
the
last
that
got
it
hereaway
but
was
a
clever
chap
the
caustic
bodie
would
dander
away
with
a
grin
leaving
a
poor
writhing
soul
when
he
reached
the
cross
he
would
tell
the
deacon
blithely
of
the
fine
one
he
had
given
him
and
the
deacon
would
lie
in
wait
to
give
him
a
fine
one
too
in
barbie
at
least
your
returning
student
is
never
met
at
the
station
with
a
brass
band
whatever
may
happen
in
more
emotional
districts
of
the
north
where
it
pleases
them
to
shed
the
tear
an
arctic
night
was
the
inspiring
theme
which
tam
set
for
the
raeburn
a
very
appropriate
subject
laughed
the
fellows
quite
in
the
style
of
his
own
lectures
for
tam
though
wise
and
a
humorist
had
his
prosy
hours
he
used
to
lecture
on
the
fifteen
characteristics
of
lady
macbeth
so
he
parcelled
the
unhappy
queen
and
he
would
announce
quite
gravely
we
will
now
approach
the
discussion
of
the
eleventh
feature
of
the
lady
gourlay
had
a
shot
at
the
raeburn
he
could
not
bring
a
radiant
fullness
of
mind
to
bear
upon
his
task
it
was
not
in
him
to
bring
but
his
morbid
fancy
set
to
work
of
its
own
accord
he
saw
a
lonely
little
town
far
off
upon
the
verge
of
lapland
night
leagues
and
leagues
across
a
darkling
plain
dark
itself
and
little
and
lonely
in
the
gloomy
splendour
of
a
northern
sky
a
ship
put
to
sea
and
gourlay
heard
in
his
ears
the
skirl
of
the
man
who
went
overboard
struck
dead
by
the
icy
water
on
his
brow
which
smote
the
brain
like
a
tomahawk
he
put
his
hand
to
his
own
brow
when
he
wrote
that
and
yes
he
cried
eagerly
it
would
be
the
would
kill
the
brain
how
it
would
go
in
a
world
of
ice
groaned
round
him
in
the
night
bergs
ground
on
each
other
and
were
rent
in
pain
he
heard
the
splash
of
great
fragments
tumbled
in
the
deep
and
felt
the
waves
of
their
distant
falling
lift
the
vessel
beneath
him
in
the
darkness
to
the
long
desolate
night
came
a
desolate
dawn
and
eyes
were
dazed
by
the
encircling
whiteness
yet
there
flashed
green
slanting
chasms
in
the
ice
and
towering
pinnacles
of
sudden
rose
lonely
and
far
away
an
unknown
sea
beat
upon
an
unknown
shore
and
the
ship
drifted
on
the
pathless
waters
a
white
dead
man
at
the
helm
yes
by
heaven
cried
gourlay
i
can
see
it
all
i
can
see
it
all
that
fellow
standing
at
the
helm
frozen
white
and
as
stiff
an
icicle
yet
do
what
he
might
he
was
unable
to
fill
more
than
half
a
dozen
small
pages
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
send
them
in
and
held
them
in
his
inky
fingers
thinking
he
would
burn
them
he
was
full
of
pity
for
his
own
inability
i
wish
i
was
a
clever
chap
he
said
mournfully
ach
well
i
try
my
luck
he
muttered
at
last
though
tam
may
guy
me
before
the
whole
class
for
doing
so
little
the
professor
however
unlike
the
majority
of
scottish
professors
rated
quality
higher
than
quantity
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
myself
he
announced
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
myself
from
the
papers
sent
in
on
the
subject
of
an
night
hear
hear
said
an
insolent
student
at
the
back
where
where
said
the
professor
stand
up
sir
a
gigantic
borderer
rose
blushing
into
view
and
was
greeted
with
howls
of
derision
by
his
fellows
tam
eyed
him
and
he
winced
you
will
apologize
in
my
private
room
at
the
end
of
the
hour
said
aquinas
as
the
students
used
to
call
him
learn
that
this
is
not
a
place
to
bray
in
the
giant
slunk
down
trying
to
hide
himself
yes
said
tam
i
have
learned
what
a
poor
sense
of
proportion
some
of
you
students
seem
to
have
it
was
not
to
see
who
could
write
the
most
but
who
could
write
the
best
that
i
set
the
theme
one
gentleman
he
has
been
careful
to
give
me
his
full
name
and
address
twinkled
tam
and
picking
up
a
huge
manuscript
he
read
it
from
the
outer
page
alexander
mactavish
of
benmacstronachan
near
auchnapeterhoolish
in
the
island
of
south
uist
has
sent
me
in
no
less
than
a
hundred
and
pages
i
dare
say
it
the
size
of
the
adjectives
he
uses
that
makes
the
thing
so
heavy
quoth
tam
and
dropped
it
thudding
on
his
desk
life
is
short
the
art
of
the
mactavish
long
and
to
tell
the
truth
gentlemen
he
gloomed
at
them
humorously
to
tell
the
truth
i
stuck
in
the
middle
roars
of
laughter
and
a
reproving
voice
oh
ta
pold
whereat
there
was
pandemonium
mactavish
was
heard
to
groan
oh
why
tid
i
leave
my
home
to
which
a
voice
responded
in
mocking
antiphone
why
tid
you
cross
ta
teep
the
noise
they
made
was
heard
at
holyrood
when
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
died
tam
resumed
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
for
ta
pold
mactavish
had
tickled
him
too
now
gentlemen
he
said
i
do
judge
essays
by
their
weight
though
i
told
they
sometimes
pursue
that
method
in
glasgow
groans
for
the
rival
university
cries
of
and
a
weary
voice
please
sir
do
mention
that
place
it
makes
me
feel
quite
the
professor
allayed
the
tumult
with
dissuasive
palm
i
believe
he
said
dryly
you
call
that
noise
of
yours
college
tramp
in
the
senatus
we
speak
as
cuddies
trudge
now
gentlemen
i
not
unwilling
to
allow
a
little
noise
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
but
really
you
must
behave
more
so
little
does
that
method
of
judging
essays
commend
itself
to
me
i
may
tell
you
that
the
sketch
which
i
consider
the
best
barely
runs
to
half
a
dozen
short
pages
young
gourlay
heart
gave
a
leap
within
him
he
felt
it
thudding
on
his
ribs
the
skin
crept
on
him
and
he
breathed
with
quivering
nostrils
gillespie
wondered
why
his
breast
heaved
it
a
curious
sketch
said
the
professor
it
contains
a
serious
blunder
in
grammar
and
several
mistakes
in
spelling
but
it
shows
in
some
ways
a
wonderful
imagination
ho
ho
thought
gourlay
of
course
there
are
various
kinds
of
imagination
said
tam
in
its
lowest
form
it
merely
recalls
something
which
the
eyes
have
already
seen
and
brings
it
vividly
before
the
mind
a
higher
form
pictures
something
which
you
never
saw
but
only
conceived
as
a
possible
existence
then
there
the
imagination
which
not
only
sees
but
hears
actually
hears
what
a
man
would
say
on
a
given
occasion
and
entering
into
his
blood
tells
you
exactly
why
he
does
it
the
highest
form
is
both
creative
and
consecrative
if
i
may
use
the
word
merging
in
diviner
thought
it
irradiates
the
world
of
that
high
power
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
essay
before
me
to
be
sure
there
was
little
occasion
for
its
use
young
gourlay
thermometer
went
down
indeed
said
aquinas
there
a
curious
want
of
bigness
in
the
sketch
no
large
nobility
of
phrase
it
is
written
in
gaspy
little
sentences
and
each
sentence
begins
like
a
schoolboy
narrative
it
as
if
a
number
of
impressions
had
seized
the
writer
mind
which
he
jotted
down
hurriedly
lest
they
should
escape
him
but
just
because
it
so
little
wordy
it
gets
the
effect
of
the
thing
faith
sirs
it
right
on
to
the
end
of
it
every
time
the
writing
of
some
folk
is
nothing
but
a
froth
of
words
lucky
if
it
glistens
without
like
a
blobber
of
iridescent
foam
but
in
this
sketch
there
a
perception
at
the
back
of
every
sentence
it
displays
indeed
too
nervous
a
sense
of
the
external
world
name
name
cried
the
students
who
were
being
deliberately
worked
by
tam
to
a
high
pitch
of
curiosity
i
would
strongly
impress
on
the
writer
said
the
shepherd
heedless
of
his
bleating
sheep
i
would
strongly
impress
on
the
writer
to
set
himself
down
for
a
spell
of
real
hard
solid
and
deliberate
thought
that
almost
morbid
perception
with
philosophy
to
back
it
might
create
an
opulent
and
vivid
mind
without
philosophy
it
would
simply
be
a
curse
with
philosophy
it
would
bring
thought
the
material
to
work
on
without
philosophy
it
would
simply
distract
and
irritate
the
mind
name

cried
the
fellows
the
winner
of
the
raeburn
said
thomas
aquinas
is
john
gourlay
gourlay
and
his
friends
made
for
the
nearest
the
occasion
they
thought
justified
a
drink
the
others
chaffed
gourlay
about
tam
advice
you
know
jack
said
gillespie
mimicking
the
sage
what
you
have
got
to
do
next
summer
is
to
set
yourself
down
for
a
spell
of
real
hard
solid
and
deliberate
thought
that
was
tam
advice
you
know
him
and
his
advice
said
gourlay
chapter
xix
there
were
only
four
other
passengers
dropped
by
the
eleven
express
at
skeighan
station
and
as
it
happened
young
gourlay
knew
them
all
they
were
petty
merchants
of
the
neighbourhood
whom
he
had
often
seen
about
barbie
the
sight
of
their
remembered
faces
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
platform
gave
him
a
delightful
sense
that
he
was
nearing
home
he
had
passed
from
the
careless
world
where
he
was
nobody
at
all
to
the
familiar
circle
where
he
was
a
somebody
a
mentioned
man
and
the
son
of
a
mentioned
man
young
gourlay
he
had
a
feeling
of
superiority
to
the
others
too
because
they
were
mere
local
journeyers
while
he
had
travelled
all
the
way
from
mighty
edinburgh
by
the
late
express
he
was
returning
from
the
outer
world
while
they
were
bits
of
bodies
who
had
only
been
to
fechars
as
edinburgh
was
to
fechars
so
was
he
to
them
round
him
was
the
halo
of
distance
and
the
mystery
of
he
felt
big
have
you
a
match
robert
he
asked
very
graciously
of
robin
gregg
one
of
the
porters
whom
he
knew
getting
his
match
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
when
it
was
lit
after
one
quick
puff
turned
it
swiftly
round
to
examine
its
burning
end
rotten
he
said
and
threw
it
away
to
light
another
the
porters
were
watching
him
and
he
knew
it
when
the
stationmaster
appeared
yawning
from
his
office
as
he
was
passing
through
the
gate
and
asked
who
it
was
it
flattered
his
vanity
to
hear
robin
answer
that
it
was
young
gourlay
of
barbie
just
back
from
the
he
had
been
so
hot
for
home
that
he
had
left
edinburgh
at
twilight
too
eager
to
wait
for
the
morrow
there
was
no
train
for
barbie
at
this
hour
of
the
night
and
of
course
there
was
no
gig
to
meet
him
even
if
he
had
sent
word
of
his
coming
there
no
need
for
travelling
so
late
old
gourlay
would
have
growled
let
him
shank
it
we
in
no
hurry
to
have
him
home
he
set
off
briskly
eager
to
see
his
mother
and
tell
her
he
had
won
the
raeburn
the
consciousness
of
his
achievement
danced
in
his
blood
and
made
the
road
light
to
his
feet
his
thoughts
were
not
with
the
country
round
him
but
entirely
in
the
moment
of
his
entrance
when
he
should
proclaim
his
triumph
with
proud
enjoyment
of
his
mother
pride
his
fancy
swept
to
his
journey
end
and
took
his
body
after
so
that
the
long
way
was
as
nothing
annihilate
by
the
leap
forward
of
his
mind
he
was
too
vain
too
full
of
himself
and
his
petty
triumph
to
have
room
for
the
beauty
of
the
night
the
sky
was
one
sea
of
lit
cloud
foamy
ridge
upon
ridge
over
all
the
heavens
and
each
wave
was
brimming
with
its
own
whiteness
seeming
unborrowed
of
the
moon
through
one
and
only
one
shone
a
distant
star
a
faint
white
speck
far
away
dimmed
by
the
nearer
splendours
of
the
sky
sometimes
the
thinning
edge
of
a
cloud
brightened
in
spume
and
round
the
brightness
came
a
circle
of
umber
making
a
window
of
fantastic
glory
for
dian
the
queen
there
her
white
vision
peeped
for
a
moment
on
the
world
and
the
next
she
was
hid
behind
a
fleecy
veil
witching
the
heavens
gourlay
was
alone
with
the
wonder
of
the
night
the
light
from
above
him
was
softened
in
a
myriad
boughs
no
longer
mere
light
and
cold
but
a
spirit
indwelling
as
their
soul
and
they
were
boughs
no
longer
but
a
woven
dream
he
walked
beneath
a
shadowed
glory
but
he
was
dead
to
it
all
one
only
fact
possessed
him
he
had
won
the
raeburn
he
had
won
the
raeburn
the
road
flew
beneath
him
almost
before
he
was
aware
the
mean
gray
streets
of
barbie
had
clipped
him
round
he
stopped
panting
from
the
hurry
of
his
walk
and
looked
at
the
quiet
houses
all
still
among
the
gloom
he
realized
with
a
sudden
pride
that
he
alone
was
in
conscious
possession
of
the
town
barbie
existed
to
no
other
mind
all
the
others
were
asleep
while
he
had
a
thrilling
consciousness
of
them
and
of
their
future
attitude
to
him
they
did
not
know
that
he
the
returning
great
one
was
present
in
their
midst
they
all
knew
of
the
raeburn
however
and
ere
long
they
would
know
that
it
was
his
he
was
glad
to
hug
his
proud
secret
in
presence
of
the
sleeping
town
of
which
he
would
be
the
talk
how
he
would
surprise
them
he
stood
for
a
little
gloating
in
his
own
sensations
then
a
desire
to
get
home
tugged
him
and
he
scurried
up
the
long
brae
he
stole
round
the
corner
of
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
roger
the
collie
came
at
him
with
a
roger
he
whispered
and
cuddled
him
and
the
old
loyalist
fawned
on
him
and
licked
his
hand
the
very
smell
of
the
dog
was
couthie
in
his
nose
the
window
of
a
bedroom
went
up
with
a
crash
now
then
who
the
devil
are
you
came
the
voice
of
old
gourlay
it
me
faither
said
john
oh
it

is
it
this
is
a
fine
time
o
night
to
come
home
faither
i
have
i
have
won
the
raeburn
it
keep
my
mannie
it

and
the
window
slammed
next
moment
it
was
up
did
young
wilson
get
onything
came
the
eager
cry
nut
him
said
john
fine
man
damned
sir
i
proud
o
ye
john
went
round
the
corner
treading
on
air
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
father
had
praised
him
he
peeped
through
a
kink
at
the
side
of
the
kitchen
blind
where
its
descent
was
arrested
by
a
flowerpot
in
the
corner
of
the
as
he
had
expected
though
it
was
long
past
midnight
his
mother
was
not
yet
in
bed
she
was
folding
a
white
cloth
over
her
bosom
and
about
her
on
the
backs
of
chairs
there
were
other
such
cloths
drying
by
the
fire
he
watched
her
curiously
once
he
seemed
to
hear
a
whimpering
moan
when
she
buttoned
her
dress
above
the
cloth
she
gazed
sadly
at
the
dying
embers
the
look
of
one
who
has
gained
short
respite
from
a
task
of
painful
tendance
on
the
body
yet
is
conscious
that
the
task
and
the
pain
are
endless
and
will
have
to
be
endured
and
till
she
dies
it
was
the
fixed
gaze
of
utter
weariness
and
apathy
a
sudden
alarm
for
his
mother
made
john
cry
her
name
she
flew
to
the
door
and
in
a
moment
had
him
in
her
arms
he
told
his
news
and
basked
in
her
adoration
she
came
close
to
him
and
john
she
said
in
a
smiling
whisper
john
she
breathed
would
ye
like
a
dram
it
was
as
if
she
was
propounding
a
roguish
plan
in
some
dear
conspiracy
he
laughed
well
he
said
seeing
we
have
won
the
raeburn
you
and
i
i
think
we
might
he
heard
her
fumbling
in
the
distant
pantry
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
listened
to
the
clinking
glass
and
by
jove
said
he
a
mother
a
fine
thing
where
janet
he
asked
when
she
returned
he
wanted
another
worshipper
oh
she
gangs
to
bed
the
moment
it
dark
his
mother
complained
like
one
aggrieved
she
always
saying
that
she
ill
i
thocht
when
she
grew
up
that
she
might
be
a
wee
help
but
she
no
use
at
all
and
sure
if
a
was
kenned
i
have
more
to
complain
o
than
she
has
atweel
ay
she
said
and
stared
at
the
embers
it
rarely
occurs
to
young
folk
who
have
never
left
their
homes
that
their
parents
may
be
dying
soon
from
infancy
they
have
known
them
as
established
facts
of
nature
like
the
streams
and
hills
they
expect
them
to
remain
but
the
young
who
have
been
away
for
six
months
are
often
struck
by
a
tragic
difference
in
their
elders
on
returning
home
to
young
gourlay
there
was
a
curious
difference
in
his
mother
she
was
almost
beautiful
her
blue
eyes
were
large
and
glittering
her
ears
waxen
and
delicate
and
her
brown
hair
swept
low
on
her
temples
above
and
below
her
lips
there
was
a
narrow
margin
of
the
purest
white
mother
he
said
anxiously
you
not
ill
are
ye
what
do
ye
need
so
many
wee
clouts
for
she
gasped
and
started
they
just
a
wheen
clouts
i
was
sorting
out
she
faltered
no
no
dear
there
noathing
wrong
wi
me
there
one
sticking
in
your
blouse
said
he
and
pointed
to
her
slack
breast
she
glanced
nervously
down
and
pushed
it
farther
in
i
dare
say
i
put
it
there
when
i
wasna
thinking
she
explained
but
she
eyed
him
furtively
to
see
if
he
were
still
looking
chapter

there
is
nothing
worse
for
a
weakling
than
a
small
success
the
strong
man
tosses
it
beneath
his
feet
as
a
step
to
rise
higher
on
he
squeezes
it
into
its
proper
place
as
a
layer
in
the
life
he
is
building
if
his
memory
dwells
on
it
for
a
moment
it
is
only
because
of
its
valuable
results
not
because
in
itself
it
is
a
theme
for
vanity
and
if
he
be
higher
than
strong
he
values
not
it
but
the
exercise
of
getting
it
viewing
his
actual
achievement
he
is
apt
to
reflect
is
this
pitiful
thing
then
all
that
i
toiled
for
finer
natures
often
experience
a
keen
depression
and
sense
of
littleness
in
the
pause
that
follows
a
success
but
the
fool
is
so
swollen
by
thought
of
his
victory
that
he
is
unfit
for
all
healthy
work
till
somebody
jags
him
and
lets
the
gas
out
he
never
forgets
the
great
thing
he
fancies
he
did
thirty
years
ago
and
expects
the
world
never
to
forget
it
either
the
more
of
a
weakling
he
is
and
the
more
incapable
of
repeating
his
former
triumph
the
more
he
thinks
of
it
and
the
more
he
thinks
of
it
the
more
it
satisfies
his
meagre
soul
and
prevents
him
essaying
another
brave
venture
in
the
world
his
petty
achievement
ruins
him
the
memory
of
it
never
leaves
him
but
swells
to
a
huge
balloon
that
lifts
him
off
his
feet
and
carries
him
till
it
lands
him
on
a
dunghill
even
from
that
proud
eminence
he
oft
his
former
triumph
to
the
world
man
you
would
think
to
see
me
here
that
i
once
held
a
great
position
thirty
year
back
i
did
a
big
thing
it
was
like
this
ye
see
and
then
follows
a
recital
of
his
faded
glories
generally
ending
with
a
hint
that
a
drink
would
be
very
acceptable
even
such
a
weakling
was
young
gourlay
his
success
in
edinburgh
petty
as
it
was
turned
his
head
and
became
one
of
the
many
causes
working
to
destroy
him
all
that
summer
at
barbie
he
swaggered
and
drank
on
the
strength
of
it
on
the
morning
after
his
return
he
clothed
himself
in
fine
raiment
he
was
always
well
dressed
till
the
end
came
and
sallied
forth
to
dominate
the
town
as
he
swaggered
past
the
cross
smoking
a
cigarette
he
seemed
to
be
conscious
that
the
very
walls
of
the
houses
watched
him
with
unusual
eyes
as
if
even
they
felt
that
yon
was
john
gourlay
whom
they
had
known
as
a
boy
proud
wearer
now
of
the
academic
wreath
the
conquering
hero
returned
to
his
home
so
gourlay
figured
them
he
the
disconsidered
had
shed
a
lustre
on
the
ancient
walls
they
were
tributaries
to
his
new
importance
somehow
their
attitude
was
different
from
what
it
had
ever
been
before
it
was
only
his
bigness
of
course
that
made
even
inanimate
things
seem
the
feeders
of
his
greatness
as
gourlay
always
alive
to
obscure
emotions
which
he
could
never
express
in
words
mused
for
a
moment
over
the
strange
new
feeling
that
had
come
to
him
a
gowsterous
voice
hailed
him
from
the
black
bull
door
he
turned
and
peter
wylie
hearty
and
keen
like
his
father
stood
him
a
drink
in
honour
of
his
victory
which
was
already
buzzed
about
the
town
drucken
wabster
wife
had
seen
to
that
ou
she
cried
his
daft
about
it
the
silly
auld
thing
she
can
speak
o
noathing
else
though
gourlay
gies
her
very
little
to
come
and
go
on
she
slipped
him
a
whole
sovereign
this
morning
to
keep
his
pouch
think
o
that
kimmers
heard
ye
ever
sic
extravagance
i
saw
her
doin
wi
my
own
eyes
aince
wud
and
aye
waur
wi
her
i
thinking
but
the
wife
the
waefu
widow
she
should
keep
in
mind
she
far
owre
browdened
upon
yon
boy
i
sure
i
howp
good
may
come
but
and
with
an
ominous
shake
of
the
head
she
ended
the
websterian
harangue
when
peter
wylie
left
him
gourlay
lit
a
cigarette
and
stood
at
the
cross
waiting
for
the
praises
yet
to
be
the
deacon
toddled
forward
on
his
thin
shanks
man
dyohn
you
won
hame
i
thee
ay
man
and
how
are
ye
gourlay
surveyed
him
with
insolent
indolent
eyes
oh
i
all
deacon
he
swaggered
how
are
and
he
sent
a
puff
of
tobacco
smoke
down
through
his
nostrils
i
declare
said
the
deacon
i
never
thaw
onybody
thmoke
like
that
before
that
be
one
of
the
thingth
ye
learn
at
college
no
doubt
yawned
gourlay
it
gives
you
the
full
flavour
of
the
the
deacon
glimmered
over
him
with
his
eyes
the
weed
said
he
jutht
tho
imphm
the
weed
then
worthy
mister
allardyce
tried
another
opening
but
dear
me
he
cried
i
forgetting
entirely
i
must
congratulate
ye
ye
been
doing
wonderth
they
tell
me
up
in
embro
just
a
little
bit
swaggered
gourlay
right
hand
on
outshot
hip
left
hand
flaunting
a
cigarette
in
air
most
delicate
tobacco
smoke
curling
from
his
lofty
nose
he
looked
down
his
face
at
the
deacon
just
a
little
bit
allardyce
just
a
little
bit
i
tossed
the
thing
off
in
a
twinkling
ay
man
dyohn
said
the
deacon
with
great
solicitude
but
you
maunna
work
that
brain
o
yours
too
hard
though
a
heid
like
yours
doesna
come
through
the
hatter
hand
ilka
day
o
the
week
you
mutht
be
careful
not
to
put
too
great
a
thtrain
o
ay
ay
often
the
best
machine
the
easiest
broken
and
the
warst
to
mend
you
should
take
a
rest
and
enjoy
yourself
but
there
what
need
i
be
telling
that
a
man
like
you
kenth
far
better
about
it
than
a
thilly
auld
country
bodie
you
be
meaning
to
have
a
grand
holiday
and
lots
o
fun
a
dram
now
and
then
eh
and
mony
a
rattle
in
the
auld
man
gig
at
this
assault
on
his
weak
place
gourlay
threw
away
his
important
manner
with
the
end
of
his
cigarette
he
could
never
maintain
the
lofty
pose
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
you
deacon
he
said
nodding
his
head
with
splurging
sincerity
i
mean
to
have
a
demned
good
holiday
one
glad
to
get
back
to
the
old
place
after
six
months
in
edinburgh
atweel
said
the
deacon
but
man
have
you
tried
the
new
whisky
at
the
black
bull
i
thaw
ye
in
wi
pate
wylie
gude
thaft
as
the
thang
o
a
mavis
on
a
nicht
at
and
fiery
as
a
highland
charge
it
was
not
in
character
for
the
deacon
to
say
such
a
thing
but
whisky
makes
the
meanest
of
scots
poetical
he
elevates
the
manner
to
the
matter
and
attains
the
perfect
but
no
doubt
the
cunning
old
prier
went
on
with
a
smiling
suavity
in
his
voice
but
no
doubt
a
man
who
knowth
edinburgh
tho
well
as
you
will
have
a
favourite
blend
of
hith
own
i
notice
that
university
men
have
a
fine
taste
in
thpirits
i
generally
prefer
cure
said
gourlay
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
but
sting
o
delight
very
good
and
so
brig
o
the
mains
ay
said
the
deacon
ay
ay
o
the
mains
ith
what
jock
allan
drinks
he
pree
noathing
else
i
dare
thay
you
thee
a
great
deal
of
him
in
embro
oh
every
week
swaggered
gourlay
we
always
together
he
and
i
alwayth
thegither
said
the
deacon
it
was
not
true
that
allan
and
gourlay
were
together
at
all
times
allan
was
kind
to
jean
richmond
son
in
his
own
ruinous
way
but
not
to
the
extent
of
being
burdened
with
the
cub
half
a
dozen
times
a
week
gourlay
was
merely
boasting
as
young
blades
are
apt
to
do
of
acquaintance
with
older
roisterers
they
think
it
makes
them
seem
men
of
the
world
and
in
his
desire
to
vaunt
his
comradeship
with
allan
john
failed
to
see
that
allardyce
was
scooping
him
out
like
an
oyster
ay
man
resumed
the
deacon
he
a
hearty
fellow
jock
no
doubt
you
have
the
great
thprees
sprees
gurgled
gourlay
and
flung
back
his
head
with
a
laugh
i
should
think
we
have
there
was
a
great
foy
at
allan
the
night
before
i
left
edinburgh
tarmillan
was
there
d
know
yon
the
finest
fellow
i
ever
met
in
my
life
and
bauldy
logan
he
another
great
chap
then
there
was
armstrong
and
gillespie
great
friends
of
mine
and
damned
clever
fellows
they
are
too
i
can
tell
you
besides
us
three
there
were
half
a
dozen
more
from
the
college
you
should
have
heard
the
talk
and
every
was
as
drunk
as
a
lord
the
last
thing
i
remember
is
some
of
us
students
dancing
round
a
while
logan
whistled
a
jig
though
gourlay
the
elder
hated
the
deacon
he
had
never
warned
his
son
to
avoid
him
to
have
said
allardyce
is
dangerous
would
have
been
to
pay
the
old
malignant
too
great
a
compliment
it
would
have
been
beneath
john
gourlay
to
admit
that
a
thing
like
allardyce
could
harm
him
and
his
young
gourlay
therefore
when
once
set
agoing
by
the
deacon
deft
management
blurted
everything
without
a
hanker
even
so
however
he
felt
that
he
had
gone
too
far
he
glanced
anxiously
at
his
companion
mum
the
word
about
this
of
course
he
said
with
a
wink
it
would
never
do
for
this
to
be
known
about
the
shutters
oh
i
ath
thound
ath
a
bell
dyohn
i
ath
thound
ath

said
the
deacon
ay

i
have
alwayth
underthood
about
the
men
o
brainth
they

heartiest

a
wheen
mair
having
rare
ploys
in
barbie
through
the
thummer
oh
we
kick
up
a
bit
of
a
dust
gourlay
sniggered
well
pleased
had
not
the
deacon
ranked
him
in
the
robustious
great
company
of
burns
i
say
deacon
come
in
and
have
a
nip
there
your
faither
grinned
the
deacon
eh
what
cried
gourlay
in
alarm
and
started
round
to
see
his
father
and
the
rev
struthers
advancing
up
the
fechars
road
eh
eh
deacon
i
i
see
you
again
about
the
nip
jutht
tho
grinned
the
deacon
we
postpone
the
drink
to
a
more
convenient
opportunity
he
toddled
away
having
no
desire
that
old
gourlay
should
find
him
talking
to
his
son
if
gourlay
suspected
him
of
pulling
the
young
fellow
leg
likely
as
not
he
would
give
an
exhibition
of
his
demned
unpleasant
manners
gourlay
and
the
minister
came
straight
towards
the
student
of
the
rev
struthers
it
may
be
said
with
truth
that
he
would
have
cut
a
remarkable
figure
in
any
society
he
had
big
splay
feet
short
stout
legs
and
a
body
of
such
bulging
bulbosity
that
all
the
droppings
of
his
spoon
which
were
many
were
caught
on
the
round
of
his
black
waistcoat
which
always
looked
as
if
it
had
just
been
spattered
by
a
gray
shower
his
eyebrows
were
bushy
and
white
and
the
hairs
slanting
up
and
out
rendered
the
meagre
brow
even
narrower
than
it
was
his
complexion
more
especially
in
cold
weather
was
a
dark
crimson
the
purply
colour
of
his
face
was
intensified
by
the
pure
whiteness
of
the
side
whiskers
projecting
stiffly
by
his
ears
and
in
when
he
was
unshaven
his
redness
revealed
more
plainly
in
turn
the
short
gleaming
stubble
that
lay
like
rime
on
his
chin
his
eyes
goggled
and
his
manner
at
all
times
was
that
of
a
staring
and
earnest
puffy
importance
was
one
of
his
nicknames
struthers
was
a
man
of
lowly
stock
who
after
a
ten
years
desperate
battle
with
his
heavy
brains
succeeded
at
the
long
last
of
it
in
passing
the
examinations
required
for
the
ministry
the
influence
of
a
wealthy
patron
then
presented
him
to
barbie
because
he
had
taken
so
long
to
get
through
the
university
himself
he
constantly
magnified
the
place
in
his
conversation
partly
to
excuse
his
own
slowness
in
getting
through
it
partly
that
the
greater
glory
might
redound
on
him
who
had
conquered
it
at
last
and
issued
from
its
portals
a
fat
and
prosperous
alumnus
stupid
men
who
have
mastered
a
system
not
by
intuition
but
by
a
plodding
effort
of
slow
years
always
exaggerate
its
importance
did
it
not
take
them
ten
years
to
understand
it
whoso
has
passed
the
system
then
is
to
their
minds
one
of
a
close
corporation
of
a
select
and
intellectual
few
and
entitled
to
pose
before
the
uninitiate
because
their
stupidity
made
the
thing
difficult
their
vanity
leads
them
to
exalt
it
woe
to
him
that
shall
scoff
at
any
detail
to
struthers
the
senatus
academicus
was
an
august
assemblage
worthy
of
the
roman
curia
and
each
petty
academic
rule
was
a
law
sacrosanct
and
holy
he
was
for
ever
talking
of
the
univairsity
mind
ye
he
would
say
it
takes
a
long
time
to
understand
even
the
workings
of
the
univairsity
the
senatus
and
it
not
for
every
one
to
criticize
he
implied
of
course
that
he
had
a
right
to
criticize
having
passed
triumphant
through
the
mighty
test
this
vanity
of
his
was
fed
by
a
peculiar
vanity
of
some
scots
peasants
who
like
to
discuss
divinity
halls
and
so
on
because
to
talk
of
these
things
shows
that
they
too
are
intelligent
men
and
know
the
awful
intellectual
ordeal
required
of
a
meenister
when
a
peasant
says
he
went
through
his
arts
course
in
three
years
and
got
a
kirk
the
moment
he
was
licensed
he
wants
you
to
see
that
he
a
smart
man
himself
and
knows
what
talking
of
there
were
several
men
in
barbie
who
liked
to
talk
in
that
way
and
among
them
puffy
importance
when
graciously
inclined
found
ready
listeners
to
his
pompous
blether
about
the
univairsity
but
what
he
liked
best
of
all
was
to
stop
a
student
in
full
view
of
the
people
and
talk
learnedly
of
his
courses
dear
me
ay
of
his
courses
and
his
matriculations
and
his
lectures
and
his
graduations
and
his
thingumbobs
that
was
why
he
bore
down
upon
our
great
essayist
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
john
he
said
with
heavy
solemnity
for
struthers
always
made
a
congregation
of
his
listener
and
droned
as
if
mounted
for
a
sermon
ye
have
done
excellently
well
this
session
ye
have
indeed
well
well
gourlay
blushed
and
thanked
him
tell
me
now
said
the
cleric
do
you
mean
to
take
your
arts
course
in
three
years
or
four
a
loang
arts
course
is
a
grand
thing
for
a
clairgyman
even
if
he
spends
half
a
dozen
years
o
he
wo
be
wasting
his
time
gourlay
glanced
at
his
father
i
mean
to
in
three
he
said
his
father
had
threatened
him
that
he
must
get
through
his
arts
in
three
years
without
deigning
of
course
to
give
any
reason
for
the
threat
said
struthers
gazing
down
the
fechars
road
as
if
visioning
great
things
it
will
require
a
strenuous
and
devoted
application
a
strenuous
and
devoted
application
even
from
the
man
of
abeelity
you
have
shown
yourself
to
be
tell
me
now
he
went
on
have
ye
heard
ainything
of
the
new
professor
of
exegesis
d
know
how
doing
young
gourlay
knew
nothing
of
the
new
professor
of
exegesis
but
he
answered
very
well
i
believe
at
a
venture
oh
he
sure
to
do
well
he
sure
to
do
well
he
one
of
the
best
men
we
have
in
the
church
i
have
just
finished
his
book
on
the
epheesians
it
most
profound
it
has
taken
me
a
whole
year
to
master
it
garvie
on
the
ephesians
is
a
book
of
a
hundred
and
eighty
pages
and
by
the
way
said
the
parson
stooping
to
scotch
in
his
ministerial
jocoseness
how
auld
tam
in
whose
class
you
were
a
he
was
appointed
to
the
professoriate
the
same
year
that
i
obtained
my
licence
i
remember
to
have
heard
him
deliver
a
lecture
on
german
philosophy
and
i
thought
it
excellently
good
but
perhaps
he
added
with
solemn
and
pondering
brows
perhaps
he
was
a
little
too
fond
of
hegel
yess
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
was
a
little
too
fond
of
hegel
eccles
listening
from
the
black
bull
door
wondered
if
hegel
was
a
drink
he
very
popular
said
young
gourlay
oh
he
sure
to
be
popular
he
merits
the
very
greatest
and
he
would
express
himself
as
being
excellently
well
pleased
with
your
theme
what
did
he
say
of
it
may
i
venture
to
inquire
beneath
the
pressure
of
his
father
presence
young
gourlay
did
not
dare
to
splurge
he
seemed
to
think
there
was
something
in
it
he
answered
modestly
enough
oh
he
would
be
sure
to
think
there
was
something
in
it
said
the
minister
staring
and
wagging
his
pow
not
a
doubt
of
not
a
doubt
of
there
must
have
been
something
in
it
to
obtain
the
palm
of
victory
in
the
face
of
such
prodigious
competeetion
it
the
intellect
of
scotland
that
goes
to
the
univairsity
and
only
the
of
the
win
the
palm
and
it
an
augury
of
great
good
for
the
future
abeelity
to
write
is
a
splendid
thing
for
the
church
john
and
allow
me
to
express
once
moar
my
great
satisfaction
that
a
pareeshioner
of
mine
is
a
of
such
brilliant
promise
though
the
elder
gourlay
disconsidered
the
church
and
thought
little
of
struthers
he
swelled
with
pride
to
think
that
the
minister
should
stop
his
offspring
in
the
main
street
of
barbie
to
congratulate
him
on
his
prospects
they
were
close
to
the
emporium
and
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
could
see
wilson
peeping
from
the
door
and
listening
to
every
word
this
would
be
a
hair
in
wilson
neck
there
were
no
clerical
compliments
for
son
the
tables
were
turned
at
last
his
father
had
a
generous
impulse
to
john
for
the
bright
triumph
he
had
won
the
gourlays
he
fumbled
in
his
trouser
pocket
and
passed
him
a
sovereign
i
kind
o
he
said
with
grim
jocosity
but
there
a
pound
to
keep
your
pouch
no
nonsense
now
he
shot
at
the
youth
with
a
loaded
eye
that
just
for
use
if
you
happen
to
be
in
company
a
gourlay
maun
spend
as
much
as
the
rest
o
folk
yes
faither
said
the
youngster
and
gourlay
went
away
that
reference
to
his
poverty
was
a
feature
of
talk
now
when
he
spoke
of
money
to
his
family
it
excused
the
smallness
of
his
doles
yet
led
them
to
believe
that
he
was
only
joking
that
he
had
plenty
of
money
if
he
would
only
consent
to
shell
it
out
and
that
was
what
he
wished
them
to
believe
his
pride
would
not
allow
him
to
confess
even
to
his
nearest
that
he
was
a
failure
in
business
and
hampered
with
financial
trouble
thus
his
manner
of
warning
them
to
be
careful
had
the
very
opposite
effect
he
has
heaps
o
cash
thought
the
son
as
he
watched
the
father
up
the
street
there
no
need
for
a
fellow
to
be
mean
flattered
as
he
fondly
imagined
by
the
deacon
flattered
by
the
minister
tipped
by
his
mother
tipped
by
his
father
with
pate
wylie
lord
but
young
gourlay
was
the
fine
fellow
symptoms
of
set
in
with
alarming
rapidity
he
had
a
wild
tendency
to
splurge
and
that
he
might
show
in
a
single
afternoon
all
the
crass
stupidity
of
which
he
was
capable
he
immediately
allowed
himself
a
veiled
insult
towards
the
daughters
of
the
they
were
really
nice
girls
in
spite
of
their
parentage
and
as
they
came
down
the
street
they
glanced
with
shy
kindness
at
the
student
from
under
their
hats
gourlay
raised
his
in
answer
to
their
nod
but
the
moment
after
and
in
their
hearing
he
yelled
blatantly
to
swipey
broon
to
come
on
and
have
a
drink
of
beer
swipey
was
a
sweep
now
for
brown
the
ragman
had
added
to
his
other
occupations
plurality
of
professions
you
observe
being
one
of
the
features
of
the
life
of
barbie
when
swipey
turned
out
of
the
fleckie
road
he
was
as
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
a
most
disreputable
phiz
and
when
gourlay
yelled
his
loud
welcome
to
that
grimy
object
what
he
wanted
to
convey
to
the
two
girls
was
ho
ho
my
pretty
misses
i
on
bowing
terms
with
you
and
yet
when
i
might
go
up
and
speak
to
ye
i
prefer
to
go
off
and
drink
with
a
sweep
d
see
that
shows
what
i
think
o
ye
all
that
summer
john
took
an
oblique
revenge
on
those
who
had
disconsidered
the
gourlays
but
would
have
liked
to
make
up
to
him
now
when
they
thought
he
was
going
to
do
well
he
took
a
paltry
revenge
by
patently
rejecting
their
advances
and
consorting
instead
and
in
their
presence
with
the
lowest
of
low
company
thus
he
vented
a
spite
which
he
had
long
cherished
against
them
for
their
former
neglect
of
janet
and
him
for
though
the
gourlay
children
had
been
welcome
at
houses
in
the
country
their
father
unpopularity
had
cut
them
off
from
the
social
life
of
the
town
when
the
provost
gave
his
grand
spree
on
hogmanay
there
was
never
an
invitation
for
the
gourlay
youngsters
the
slight
had
rankled
in
the
boy
mind
now
however
some
of
the
local
bigwigs
had
an
opinion
with
very
little
to
support
it
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
successful
man
and
they
showed
a
disposition
to
be
friendly
john
with
a
rankling
memory
of
their
former
coldness
flouted
every
overture
by
letting
them
see
plainly
that
he
preferred
to
their
company
that
of
swipey
broon
jock
and
every
ragamuffin
of
the
town
it
was
a
kind
of
stroke
at
them
that
was
the
paltry
form
which
his
father
pride
took
in
him
he
did
not
see
that
he
was
harming
himself
rather
than
his
father
enemies
harm
himself
he
did
for
you
could
not
associate
with
jock
and
the
like
without
drinking
in
every
howff
you
came
across
when
the
bodies
assembled
next
day
for
their
morning
the
deacon
was
able
to
inform
them
that
young
gourlay
was
back
from
the
college
dafter
than
ever
and
that
he
had
pulled
his
leg
as
far
as
he
wanted
it
oh
he
said
i
played
him
like
a
kitten
wi
a
cork
and
found
out
ainything
and
everything
i
wished
i
dithcovered
that
he
in
wi
jock
allan
and
that
crowd
i
edged
the
conversation
round
on
purpoth
unless
he
wath
blowing
his
trump
which
i
greatly
doubt
they
as
thick
as
thieveth
ye

the

ingathering
weel

said
tam
wylie
the
mair
the
pity
o
that
deacon
oh
a
pity
said
the
deacon
and
he
bowed
his
body
solemnly
with
outspread
hands
no
doubt
a
pity
and
he
wagged
his
head
from
side
to
side
the
picture
of
a
poignant
woe
i
saw
him
in
the
black
bull
yestreen
said
brodie
who
had
been
silent
hitherto
in
utter
scorn
of
the
lad
they
were
speaking
of
too
disgusted
to
open
his
mouth
he
was
standing
drinks
to
a
crowd
that
were
puffing
him
up
about
that
prize
o
his
it
alwayth
the
numskull
hath
the
most
conceit
said
the
deacon
and
yet
there
must
be
something
in
him
too
to
get
that
prize
mused
the
a
little
ability
a
dangerous
thing
said
johnny
coe
who
could
think
at
times
to
be
safe
you
should
be
a
genius
winged
and

or
a
crawling

nobody
understood
him

and

soon
make

of
said
brodie
curtly
and
snubbed
the
philosopher
before
the
summer
holiday
was
over
it
lasts
six
months
in
scotland
young
gourlay
was
a
tippler
his
shrinking
abhorrence
from
the
scholastic
life
of
edinburgh
flung
him
with
all
the
greater
abandon
into
the
conviviality
he
had
learned
to
know
at
home
his
mother
who
always
seemed
to
sit
up
now
after
janet
and
gourlay
were
in
bed
often
let
him
in
during
the
small
hours
and
as
he
hurried
past
her
in
the
lobby
he
would
hold
his
breath
lest
she
should
smell
it
unco
late
dear
she
would
say
wearily
but
no
other
reproach
did
she
utter
i
was
taking
a
walk
he
would
answer
thickly
there
a
fine
moon
it
was
true
that
when
his
terrible
depression
seized
him
he
was
sometimes
tempted
to
seek
the
rapture
and
peace
of
a
moonlight
walk
upon
the
fleckie
road
in
his
crude
clay
there
was
a
vein
of
poetry
he
could
be
alone
in
the
country
and
not
lonely
had
he
lived
in
a
green
quiet
place
he
might
have
learned
the
solace
of
nature
for
the
wounded
when
eve
sheds
her
spiritual
dews
but
the
mean
pleasures
to
be
found
at
the
cross
satisfied
his
nature
and
stopped
him
midway
to
that
soothing
beauty
of
the
woods
and
streams
which
might
have
brought
healing
and
a
wise
quiescence
his
success
such
as
it
was
had
gained
him
a
circle
such
as
it
was
and
the
assertive
nature
proper
to
his
son
gave
him
a
kind
of
lead
amongst
them
yet
even
his
henchmen
saw
through
his
swaggering
swipey
broon
turned
on
him
one
night
and
threatened
to
split
his
mouth
and
he
went
as
white
as
the
wall
behind
him
among
his
other
follies
he
assumed
the
pose
of
a
man
who
could
an
he
would
who
had
it
in
him
to
do
great
things
if
he
would
only
set
about
them
in
this
he
was
partly
playing
up
to
a
foolish
opinion
of
his
more
ignorant
associates
it
was
they
who
suggested
the
pose
to
him
devilish
clever
he
heard
them
whisper
one
night
as
he
stood
in
the
door
of
a
tavern
he
could
do
it
if
he
liked
only
he
too
fond
o
the
fun
young
gourlay
flushed
where
he
stood
in
the
darkness
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
criticism
of
his
character
which
was
nevertheless
a
compliment
to
his
wits
he
felt
that
he
must
play
up
at
once
to
the
character
assigned
him
ho
ho
my
lads
he
cried
entering
with
a
splurge
let
make
a
night
i
should
be
working
for
my
degree
but
i
suppose
i
can
get
it
easy
enough
when
the
time
comes
what
did
i
tell
ye
said
nudging
an
elbow
and
gourlay
saw
the
nudge
here
at
last
he
had
found
the
sweet
seduction
of
a
proper
pose
that
of
a
homme
of
a
man
who
would
be
a
genius
were
it
not
for
the
excess
of
his
qualities
would
he
continue
to
appear
a
genius
then
he
must
continue
to
display
that
excess
which
so
he
wished
them
to
believe
alone
prevented
his
brilliant
achievements
it
was
all
a
curious
vicious
inversion
you
could
do
great
things
if
you
did
drink
crooned
the
fools
see
how
i
drink
gourlay
seemed
to
answer
that
is
why
i
do
do
great
things
but
mind
you
i
could
do
them
were
it
not
for
this
thus
every
glass
he
tossed
off
seemed
to
hint
in
a
roundabout
way
at
the
glorious
heights
he
might
attain
if
he
did
drink
it
his
very
roistering
became
a
pose
and
his
vanity
made
him
roister

more
to
make
the
pose

on
a
beautiful
evening
in

when
a
new
crescent
moon
was
pointing
through
the
saffron
sky
like
the
lit
tip
of
a
finger
the
city
fathers
had
assembled
at
the
corner
of
the
fleckie
road
though
the
moon
was
peeping
the
dying
glory
of
the
day
was
still
upon
the
town
the
white
smoke
rose
straight
and
far
in
the
golden
mystery
of
the
heavens
and
a
line
of
dark
roofs
transfigured
against
the
west
wooed
the
eye
to
musing
but
though
the
bodies
felt
the
fine
evening
bathe
them
in
a
sensuous
content
as
they
smoked
and
dawdled
they
gave
never
a
thought
to
its
beauty
for
there
had
been
a
blitheness
in
the
town
that
day
and
every
other
man
seemed
to
have
been
preeing
the
demijohn
drucken
wabster
and
brown
the
ragman
came
round
the
corner
staggering
young
gourlay
drunk
blurted
wabster
and
reeled
himself
as
he
spoke
is
he
a
wee
fou
said
the
deacon
eagerly
wee
be
damned
said
wabster
he
as
fou
as
the
baltic
sea
if
you
wait
here
you
be
sure
to
see
him
he
be
round
the
corner
directly
me
is
he
so
bad
as
that
said
the
raising
his
hands
in
solemn
reprobation
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
at
the
same
time
as
if
it
pained
them
to
look
on
a
world
that
endured
the
burden
of
a
young
gourlay
in
broad
daylight
too
he
sighed
me
has
he
come
to
this
yis
pravast
hiccupped
brown
he
has
he
as
phull
of
drink
as
a
phull
of
whelk
he
nearly
as
phull
as
meself
and
begorra
that
mighty
phull
he
stared
suddenly
scratching
his
head
solemnly
as
if
the
fact
had
just
occurred
to
him
then
he
winked
you
could
set
fire
to
his
braith
cried
wabster
a
match
to
his
mouth
would
send
him
in
a
lowe
a
living
gas
jet
said
brown
they
staggered
away
sometimes
rubbing
shoulders
as
they
lurched
together
sometimes
with
the
road
between
them
i
kenned
young
gourlay
was
on
the
fuddle
when
i
saw
him
swinging
off
this
morning
in

fallow
when
i
had
them
on
and
i
had
a
verra
disreputable
hat
he
added

i
christened
him
for
he
was
a
perfect
devil
and
i
never
cocked
him
owre
my
lug
on

but
he
seemed
to
whisper

go
out

the

at

that

what
he
really
wants
however
is
to
see
the

even
if

toper
to

must
show
himself
fond
o

when

the

it

manner
the
deacon
there
couldna

wi
a
hearty
oath
to
save
his
withered
sowl
i
kenned
a
trifle
o

lang
syne
that

bude
to

the

so
he

was
a
lauchable
dirt
that

he

fou
alexander

george
the

doucely
for

ours
for
he
saftie
and
daftie
baith
and
that
the
deidly

and
smacked

the
important
man
tyuts
said
the
baker
folk
should
be
kind
to
folk
there
may
be
a
possibeelity
for
the
gourlays
in
the
youngster
yet
he
would
have
said
more
but
at
that
moment
his
sonsy
big

came
out
with
oh

a
roguish
and
kindly
smile
and
tom
tom

she
what

with
comic
shrewdness
from
where
he
sat
on
his

for

through
her
and

looking
after

she
kenned
no
to

that

young
gourlay
came
staggering
round
the
corner
a
little
sprung
as
they
phrase
it
in
barbie
but
not
so
bad
as
they
had
hoped
to
see
him
webster
and
the
ragman
had
exaggerated
the
condition
of
their
probably
their
own
oscillation
lent
itself
to
everything
they
saw
john
zigzagged
it
is
true
but
otherwise
he
was
fairly
steady
on
his
pins
unluckily
however
failing
to
see
a
stone
before
on
the
road
he
tripped
and
went
sprawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
a
titter
went
what
the
hell
are
you
laughing
at
he
snarled
leaping
up
quick
to
feel
the
slight
blatant
to
resent
it
tyuts
man
tam
wylie
rebuked
him
in
a
careless
scorn
with
a
parting
scowl
he
went
swaggering
up
the
street

my

the
deacon
between
his
thin
till
the
hat
leapt
on
his
startled
cranium
no
not
a
lengthy
stay
just
down
for
a
flying
visit
to
see
my
little
girl

glad
to
get
back
to

again
barbie
too
quiet
for
my
tastes
no

place
no
life
at
all
the
speaker
was
davie
aird
draper
and
buck
no
life
at
all
he
cried
as
he
shot
down
his
cuffs
with
a
jerk
and
swung
up
and
down
the
of
the
red
lion
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
fawn
overcoat
reaching
to
his
heels
with
two
big
yellow
buttons
at
the
waist
behind
in
the
most
approved
fashion
of
the
horsy
he
paused
in
his
swaggering
to
survey
the
backs
of
his
long
white
delicate
hands
holding
them
side
by
side
before
him
as
if
to
make
sure
they
were
the
same
size
he
was
letting
the
deacon
see
his
ring
then
pursing
his
chin
down
with
a
fastidious
and
critical
regard
he
picked
a
long
fair
hair
off
his
left
coat
sleeve
he
held
it
high
as
he
had
seen
them
do
on
the
stage
of
the
theatre
royal
sweet
souvenir
he
cried
and
kissed
it
most
dear
remembrance
the
deacon
fed
on
the
sight
the
richness
of
his
satiric
perception
was
too
great
to
permit
of
speech
he
could
only
gloat
and
be
dumb
waiting
for
jack
gourlay
aird
rattled
again
he
off
to
college
again
and
we
driving
in
his
father
trap
to
meet
the
express
at
skeighan
station
wonder
what
keeping

two
thousand
parcels
a
week
go
out
of
our
place
and
all
of
up
to
time
ah
there
he
is
he
added
as
the
harsh
grind
of
wheels
was
heard
on
the
gravel
at
the
door
thank
god
we
soon
be
in
civilization
young
gourlay
entered
greatcoated
and
lordly
through
the
two
halves
of
that
door
good
he
cried
just
a
minute
aird
till
i
get
my
flask
filled
my
weapon
primed
and
ready
aird
and
slapped
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
john
birled
a
bright
sovereign
on
the
counter
one
of
twenty
old
gourlay
had
battered
his
brains
to
get
together
for
the
boy
expenses
the
young
fellow
rattled
the
change
into
his
trouser
pocket
like
a
master
of
millions
the
deacon
and
another
idler
or
two
gathered
about
the
steps
in
the
darkness
to
see
that
royal
going
off
peter
riney
little
old
figure
could
be
seen
on
the
front
seat
of
the
gig
aird
was
already
mounted
behind
the
mare
a
worthy
successor
to
spanking
tam
pawed
the
gravel
and
fretted
in
impatience
her
sharp
ears
seen
pricked
against
the
gloom
worked
to
and
fro
a
widening
cone
of
light
shone
out
from
the
leftward
lamp
of
the
gig
full
on
a
glistering
laurel
which
simpson
had
growing
by
his
porch
each
smooth
leaf
of
the
green
bush
gave
back
a
separate
gleam
vivid
to
the
eye
in
that
pouring
yellowness
gourlay
stared
at
the
bright
evergreen
and
forget
for
a
moment
where
he
was
his
lips
parted
and
as
they
saw
in
the
light
from
the
door
his
look
grew
dreamy
and
the
truth
was
that
all
the
impressions
of
a
last
day
at
home
were
bitten
in
on
his
brain
as
by
acid
in
the
very
middle
of
his
swaggering
gusto
that
gusto
was
largely
real
true
for
it
seemed
a
fine
thing
to
go
splurging
off
to
college
in
a
gig
but
it
was
still
more
largely
assumed
to
combat
the
sorrow
of
departure
his
heart
was
in
his
boots
at
the
thought
of
going
back
to
accursed
edinburgh
to
those
lodgings
those
dreary
damnable
lodgings
thus
his
nature
was
reduced
to
its
real
elements
in
the
hour
of
leaving
home
it
was
only
for
a
swift
moment
he
forgot
to
splurge
but
for
that
moment
the
cloak
of
his
swaggering
dropped
away
and
he
was
his
naked
self
morbidly
alive
to
the
impressions
of
the
world
afraid
of
life
clinging
to
the
familiar
and
the
known
that
was
why
he
gazed
with
wistful
eyes
at
that
laurel
clump
so
vivid
in
the
pouring
rays
so
vivid
there
it
stood
for
all
the
dear
country
round
which
was
now
hidden
by
the
darkness
it
centred
his
world
among
its
leaves
it
was
a
last
picture
of
loved
barbie
that
was
fastening
on
his
mind
there
would
be
fine
gardens
in
edinburgh
no
doubt
but
oh
that
couthie
laurel
by
the
red
lion
door
it
was
his
friend
he
had
known
it
always
the
spell
lasted
but
a
moment
one
of
those
moments
searching
a
nature
to
its
depths
yet
flitting
like
a
lonely
shadow
on
the
autumn
wheat
but
aird
was
already
fidgeting
hurry
up
jack
he
cried
we
need
to
pelt
if
we
mean
to
get
the
train
gourlay
started
in
a
moment
he
had
slipped
from
one
self
to
another
and
was
the
blusterer
once
more
right
he
splurged
hover
a
blink
till
i
light
my
cigar
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
smoking
cigars
but
he
had
bought
a
packet
on
purpose
that
he
might
light
one
before
his
admiring
onlookers
ere
he
went
away
nothing
like
cutting
a
dash
he
was
seen
puffing
for
a
moment
with
indrawn
cheeks
his
head
to
one
side
the
flame
of
the
flickering
vesta
lighting
up
his
face
his
hat
pushed
back
till
it
rested
on
his
collar
his
fair
hair
hanging
down
his
brow
then
he
sprang
to
the
driving
seat
and
gathered
up
the
reins
deacon
see
and
behave
yourself
he
flung
across
his
shoulder
and
they
were
off
with
a
bound
said
the
outraged
deacon
peter
riney
was
quite
proud
to
have
the
honour
of
driving
two
such
bucks
to
the
station
it
lent
him
a
consequence
he
would
be
able
to
say
when
he
came
back
that
he
had
been
awa
wi
the
young
mester
for
peter
said
mester
and
was
laughed
at
by
the
barbie
wits
who
knew
that
maister
was
the
proper
english
the
splurging
twain
rallied
him
and
drew
him
out
in
talk
passed
him
their
flasks
at
the
brownie
brae
had
him
at
their
nonsense
it
was
a
night
to
the
withered
little
man
that
was
how
young
gourlay
left
barbie
for
what
was
to
prove
his
last
session
at
the
university
all
gourlay
swankie
chaps
had
gone
with
the
going
of
his
trade
only
peter
riney
the
queer
little
oddity
remained
there
was
a
loyal
simplicity
in
peter
which
never
allowed
him
to
question
the
gourlays
he
had
been
too
long
in
their
service
to
be
of
use
to
any
other
while
there
was
a
hand
turn
to
be
done
about
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
he
was
glad
to
have
the
chance
of
doing
it
his
respect
for
his
surly
tyrant
was
as
great
as
ever
he
took
his
pittance
of
a
wage
and
was
thankful
above
all
he
worshipped
young
gourlay
to
be
in
touch
with
a
man
was
a
reflected
glory
even
the
escapades
noised
about
the
little
town
to
his
gleeful
ignorance
were
the
signs
of
a
man
of
the
world
peter
chuckled
when
he
heard
them
talked
of
clever
fallow
the
young
mester
the
bowed
little
man
would
say
sucking
his
pipe
of
an
evening
clever
fallow
the
young
mester
and
hardy
too
infernal
hardy
loyal
peter
believed
it
but
ere
four
months
had
gone
peter
was
discharged
it
was
on
the
day
after
gourlay
sold
black
sally
the
mare
to
get
a
little
money
to
go
on
with
it
was
a
bright
spring
day
of
enervating
softness
a
fosie
day
a
day
when
the
pores
of
everything
seemed
opened
people
brains
felt
pulpy
and
they
sniffed
as
with
winter
colds
peter
riney
was
opening
a
pit
of
potatoes
in
the
big
garden
shovelling
aside
the
mould
and
tearing
off
the
inner
covering
of
yellow
straw
which
seemed
strange
and
unnatural
somehow
when
suddenly
revealed
in
its
glistening
dryness
beneath
the
moist
dark
earth
little
crumbles
of
mould
trickled
down
in
among
the
flattened
shining
straws
in
a
tree
near
peter
two
pigeons
were
gurgling
and
mating
for
the
coming
year
he
fell
to
sorting
out
the
potatoes
throwing
the
bad
ones
on
a
heap
aside
as
they
call
it
in
the
north
the
enervating
softness
was
at
work
on
peter
head
too
and
from
time
to
time
as
he
waled
he
wiped
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
gourlay
watched
him
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
once
or
twice
he
moistened
his
lips
and
cleared
his
throat
and
frowned
as
one
who
would
broach
unpleasant
news
it
was
not
like
him
to
hesitate
but
the
old
man
encased
in
senility
was
ill
to
disturb
he
was
intent
on
nothing
but
the
work
before
him
it
was
mechanical
and
soothing
and
occupied
his
whole
mind
gourlay
so
often
the
trampling
brute
without
knowing
it
felt
it
brutal
to
wound
the
faithful
old
creature
dreaming
at
his
toil
he
would
have
found
it
much
easier
to
discharge
a
younger
and
a
keener
man
stop
peter
he
said
at
last
i
do
need
you
ainy
more
peter
rose
stiffly
from
his
knees
and
shook
the
mould
with
a
pitiful
gesture
from
his
hands
his
mouth
was
fallen
slack
and
showed
a
few
yellow
tusks
eh
he
asked
vaguely
the
thought
that
he
must
leave
the
gourlays
could
not
penetrate
his
mind
i
do
need
you
ainy
more
said
gourlay
again
and
met
his
eye
steadily
i
gey
auld
said
peter
still
shaking
his
hands
with
that
pitiful
gesture
but
i
only
need
a
bite
and
a
sup
man
i
willin
to
tak
onything
it
no
that
said
gourlay
sourly
it
no
that
but
i
giving
up
the
business
peter
said
nothing
but
gazed
away
down
the
garden
his
sunken
mouth
forgetting
to
munch
its
straw
which
dangled
by
his
chin
i
an
auld
servant
he
said
at
last
and
mind
ye
he
flashed
in
pride
i
a
true
ane
oh
you
a
that
gourlay
grunted
you
have
been
a
good
servant
it
be
the
poorhouse
it
like
mused
peter
man
have
ye
noathing
for
us
to
do
he
asked
pleadingly
gourlay
jaw
clamped
noathing
peter
he
said
sullenly
noathing
and
slipped
some
money
into
peter
heedless
palm
peter
stared
stupidly
down
at
the
coins
he
seemed
dazed
ay
weel
he
said
i
feenish
the
tatties
at
ony
rate
no
no
peter
and
gourlay
gripped
him
by
the
shoulder
as
he
turned
back
to
his
work
no
no
i
have
no
right
to
keep
you
never
mind
about
the
money
you
deserve
something
going
so
suddenly
after
sic
a
long
service
it
just
a
bit
present
to
mind
you
o
to
mind
you
o
he
broke
suddenly
and
scowled
across
the
garden
some
men
when
a
feeling
touches
them
express
their
emotion
in
tears
others
by
an
angry
scowl
hating
themselves
inwardly
perhaps
for
their
weakness
in
being
moved
hating
too
the
occasion
that
has
probed
their
weakness
it
was
because
he
felt
parting
with
peter
so
keenly
that
gourlay
behaved
more
sullenly
than
usual
peter
had
been
with
father
in
his
present
master
boyhood
had
always
been
faithful
and
submissive
in
his
humble
way
was
nearer
the
grain
merchant
than
any
other
man
in
barbie
he
was
the
only
human
being
gourlay
had
ever
deigned
to
joke
with
and
that
in
itself
won
him
an
affection
more
the
going
of
peter
meant
the
going
of
everything
it
cut
gourlay
to
the
quick
therefore
he
scowled
without
a
word
of
thanks
for
the
money
peter
knocked
the
mould
off
his
heavy
boots
striking
one
against
the
other
clumsily
and
shuffled
away
across
the
bare
soil
but
when
he
had
gone
twenty
yards
he
stopped
and
came
back
slowly
sir
he
said
with
a
rueful
smile
and
held
out
his
hand
gourlay
gripped
it
peter
damn
ye
man
peter
wondered
vaguely
why
he
was
sworn
at
but
he
felt
that
it
was
not
in
anger
he
still
clung
to
his
master
hand
i
been
fifty
year
the
gourlays
said
he
ay
ay
and
this
it
seems
is
the
end
oh
gang
away
cried
gourlay
gang
away
man
and
peter
went
away
gourlay
went
out
to
the
big
green
gate
where
he
had
often
stood
in
his
pride
and
watched
his
old
servant
going
down
the
street
peter
was
so
bowed
that
the
back
of
his
velveteen
coat
was
halfway
up
his
spine
and
the
bulging
pockets
at
the
corners
were
midway
down
his
thighs
gourlay
had
seen
the
fact
a
thousand
times
but
it
never
gripped
him
before
he
stared
till
peter
disappeared
round
the
bend
o
the
brae
ay
ay
said
he
ay
ay
there
goes
the
last
o
them
it
was
a
final
run
of
that
brought
gourlay
to
this
desperate
pass
when
everything
seemed
to
go
against
him
he
tried
several
speculations
with
a
gambler
hope
that
they
might
do
well
and
retrieve
the
situation
he
abandoned
the
sensible
direction
of
affairs
that
is
and
trusted
entirely
to
chance
as
men
are
apt
to
do
when
despairing
and
chance
betrayed
him
he
found
himself
of
a
sudden
at
the
end
of
his
resources
through
all
his
troubles
his
one
consolation
was
the
fact
that
he
had
sent
john
to
the
university
that
was
something
saved
from
the
wreck
at
any
rate
more
and
more
as
his
other
supports
fell
away
gourlay
attached
himself
to
the
future
of
his
son
it
became
the
of
his
hopes
if
he
had
remained
a
prosperous
man
john
success
would
have
been
merely
incidental
something
to
disconsider
in
speech
at
least
however
pleased
he
might
have
been
at
heart
but
now
it
was
the
whole
of
life
to
him
for
one
thing
the
son
success
would
justify
the
father
past
and
prevent
it
being
quite
useless
it
would
have
produced
a
minister
a
successful
man
one
of
an
esteemed
profession
again
that
success
would
be
a
salve
to
gourlay
wounded
pride
the
gourlays
would
show
barbie
they
could
flourish
yet
in
spite
of
their
present
downcome
thus
in
the
collapse
of
his
fortunes
the
son
grew
in
the
father
eyes
nor
did
his
own
poverty
seem
to
him
a
just
bar
to
his
son
prosperity
i
have
put
him
through
his
arts
thought
gourlay
surely
he
can
do
the
rest
himsell
lots
of
young
chaps
when
they
warstle
through
their
arts
teach
the
sons
of
swells
to
get
a
little
money
to
gang
through
diveenity
my
boy
can
surely
do
the
like
again
and
again
as
gourlay
felt
himself
slipping
under
in
the
world
of
barbie
his
hopes
turned
to
john
in
edinburgh
if
that
boy
would
only
hurry
up
and
get
through
to
make
a
hame
for
the
lassie
and
the
auld
wife
chapter
xxiii
young
gourlay
spent
that
winter
in
edinburgh
pretty
much
as
he
had
spent
the
last
last
winter
however
it
was
simply
a
weak
need
for
companionship
that
drew
him
to
the
howff
this
winter
it
was
more
it
was
the
need
of
a
formed
habit
that
must
have
its
wonted
satisfaction
he
had
a
further
impulse
to
conviviality
now
it
had
become
a
habit
that
compelled
him
the
diversions
of
some
men
are
merely
subsidiary
to
their
lives
externals
easy
to
be
dropped
with
others
they
usurp
the
man
they
usurp
a
life
when
it
is
never
happy
away
from
them
when
in
the
midst
of
other
occupations
absent
pleasures
rise
vivid
to
the
mind
with
an
irresistible
call
young
gourlay
imagination
always
visioning
absent
delights
combined
with
his
weakness
of
will
never
gripping
to
the
work
before
him
to
make
him
hate
his
lonely
studies
and
long
for
the
jolly
company
of
his
friends
he
never
opened
his
books
of
an
evening
but
he
thought
to
himself
i
wonder
what
they
doing
at
the
howff
at
once
he
visualized
the
scene
imagined
every
detail
saw
them
in
their
jovial
hours
and
seeing
them
so
happy
he
longed
to
be
with
them
on
that
night
long
ago
when
his
father
ordered
him
to
college
his
cowardly
and
too
vivid
mind
thought
of
the
ploys
the
fellows
would
be
having
along
the
barbie
roads
while
he
was
mewed
up
in
edinburgh
he
saw
the
barbie
rollickers
in
his
mind
eye
and
the
student
in
his
lonely
rooms
and
contrasted
them
mournfully
so
now
every
night
he
saw
the
cosy
companions
in
their
howff
and
shivered
at
his
own
isolation
he
felt
a
tugging
at
his
heart
to
be
off
and
join
them
and
his
will
was
so
weak
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
made
no
resistance
to
the
impulse
he
had
always
a
feeling
of
depression
when
he
must
sit
down
to
his
books
it
was
the
start
that
gravelled
him
he
would
look
round
his
room
and
hate
it
mutter
damn
it
i
must
work
and
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
would
seat
himself
before
an
outspread
volume
on
the
table
tugging
the
hair
on
a
puckered
forehead
sometimes
the
depression
left
him
when
he
buckled
to
his
work
as
his
mind
became
occupied
with
other
things
the
vision
of
the
howff
was
expelled
usually
however
the
stiffness
of
his
brains
made
the
reading
drag
heavily
and
he
rarely
attained
the
sufficing
happiness
of
a
student
eager
and
engrossed
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
he
would
be
gaping
across
the
table
and
wondering
what
they
were
doing
at
the
howff
will
logan
be
singing
glen
or
is
gillespie
fiddling
highland
tunes
by
jing
with
his
elbow
going
it
merrily
lord
i
would
like
to
hear
drummond
o
perth
or
daylicht
they
might
buck
me
up
a
bit
i
just
slip
out
for
ten
minutes
to
see
what
they
doing
and
be
back
directly
he
came
back
at
two
in
the
morning
staggering
on
a
bleak
spring
evening
near
the
end
of
february
young
gourlay
had
gone
to
the
howff
to
escape
the
shuddering
misery
of
the
streets
it
was
that
treacherous
spring
weather
which
blights
only
two
days
ago
the
air
had
been
sluggish
and
balmy
now
an
easterly
wind
nipped
the
gray
city
naked
and
bare
there
was
light
enough
with
the
lengthening
days
to
see
plainly
the
rawness
of
the
world
there
were
cold
yellow
gleams
in
windows
fronting
a
lonely
west
uncertain
little
puffs
of
wind
came
swirling
round
corners
and
made
dust
and
pieces
of
dirty
white
paper
gyrate
on
the
roads
prosperous
old
gentlemen
pacing
home
rotund
in
their
coats
had
clear
drops
at
the
end
of
their
noses
sometimes
they
stopped
their
trousers
legs
flapping
behind
them
and
trumpeted
loudly
into
red
silk
handkerchiefs
young
gourlay
had
fled
the
streets
it
was
the
kind
of
night
that
made
him
cower
by
eight
however
he
was
merry
with
the
and
making
a
butt
of
himself
to
amuse
the
company
he
was
not
enough
to
banter
a
comrade
readily
nor
hardy
enough
to
essay
it
unprovoked
on
the
other
hand
his
swaggering
love
of
notice
impelled
him
to
some
form
of
talk
that
would
attract
attention
so
he
made
a
point
of
always
coming
with
daft
stories
of
things
comic
that
befell
him
at
least
he
said
they
did
but
if
his
efforts
were
greeted
with
too
loud
a
roar
implying
not
only
appreciation
of
the
stories
but
also
a
contempt
for
the
man
who
could
tell
them
of
himself
his
sensitive
vanity
was
immediately
wounded
and
he
swelled
with
sulky
anger
and
the
moment
after
he
would
splurge
and
bluster
to
reassert
his
dignity
i
remember
when
i
was
a
boy
he
hiccupped
i
had
a
pet
goose
at
home
there
was
a
titter
at
the
queer
beginning
i
was
to
get
the
price
of
it
for
myself
and
so
when
christmas
drew
near
i
went
to
old
macfarlane
the
poulterer
in
skeighan
you
buy
a
goose
said
i
ye
for
sale
my
man
was
his
answer
armstrong
flung
back
his
head
and
roared
prolonging
the
loud
through
his
big
nose
and
open
mouth
long
after
the
impulse
to
honest
laughter
was
exhausted
he
always
laughed
with
false
loudness
to
indicate
his
own
superiority
when
he
thought
a
man
had
been
guilty
of
a
public
silliness
the
laugh
was
meant
to
show
the
company
how
far
above
such
folly
was
armstrong
gourlay
scowled
damn
armstrong
he
thought
what
did
he
yell
like
that
for
does
he
think
i
did
see
the
point
of
the
joke
against
myself
would
i
have
told
it
if
i
had
this
is
what
comes
of
being
sensitive
i
always
too
sensitive
i
felt
there
was
an
awkward
silence
and
i
told
a
story
against
myself
to
dispel
it
in
fun
and
this
is
what
i
get
curse
the
big
brute
he
thinks
i
have
given
myself
away
but
i
show
him
he
was
already
mellow
but
he
took
another
swig
to
hearten
him
as
was
his
habit
there
a
damned
sight
too
much
yell
about
your
laugh
armstrong
he
said
truly
enough
getting
a
courage
from
his
anger
and
the
drink
no
gentleman
laughs
like
that
inepto
res
ineptior
nulla
said
tarmillan
who
was
on
one
of
his
rare
visits
to
the
howff
he
was
too
busy
and
too
wise
a
man
to
frequent
it
greatly
armstrong
blushed
and
gourlay
grew
big
and
brave
in
the
backing
of
the
great
tarmillan
he
took
another
swig
on
the
strength
of
it
but
his
resentment
was
still
surging
when
tarmillan
went
and
the
three
students
were
left
by
themselves
gourlay
continued
to
nag
and
bluster
for
that
blatant
laugh
of
armstrong
rankled
in
his
mind
i
saw
hepburn
in
the
street
said
gillespie
by
way
of
a
diversion
who
hepburn
snapped
gourlay
oh
do
you
remember
he
the
big
border
chap
who
got
into
a
row
with
auld
tam
on
the
day
you
won
your
prize
essay
that
should
surely
appease
the
fool
thought
gillespie
it
was
only
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
hepburn
was
at
college
for
he
has
lots
of
money
and
here
he
never
apologized
to
tam
he
said
he
would
go
down
first
he
was
damned
right
spluttered
gourlay
some
of
these
profs
think
too
much
of
themselves
they
would
bully
there
good
stuff
in
the
gourlays
he
went
on
with
a
meaning
look
at
armstrong
they
not
to
be
scoffed
at
i
would
stand
insolence
from
no
man
ay
man
said
armstrong
would
you
face
up
to
a
professor
would
i
said
the
tipsy
youth
and
to
you
too
if
you
went
too
far
he
became
so
quarrelsome
as
the
night
went
on
that
his
comrades
filled
him
up
with
drink
in
the
hope
of
deadening
his
ruffled
sensibilities
it
was
yes
yes
jack
but
never
mind
about
that
have
another
drink
just
to
show
there
no
among
friends
when
they
left
the
howff
they
went
to
gillespie
and
drank
more
and
after
that
they
roamed
about
the
town
at
two
in
the
morning
the
other
two
brought
gourlay
to
his
door
he
was
assuring
armstrong
he
was
not
a
gentleman
when
he
went
to
bed
the
fancied
insult
he
had
suffered
swelled
to
monstrous
proportions
in
his
fevered
brain
did
armstrong
despise
him
the
thought
was
poison
he
lay
in
brooding
anger
and
his
mind
was
fluent
in
wrathful
harangues
in
some
imaginary
encounter
of
the
future
in
which
he
was
a
glorious
victor
he
flowed
in
eloquent
scorn
of
armstrong
and
his
ways
if
i
could
talk
like
this
always
he
thought
what
a
fellow
i
would
be
he
seemed
gifted
with
uncanny
insight
into
armstrong
character
he
noted
every
weakness
in
the
rushing
whirl
of
his
thoughts
set
them
in
order
one
by
one
saw
himself
laying
bare
the
man
with
savage
glee
when
next
they
should
encounter
he
would
whiten
the
big
brute
face
by
showing
he
had
probed
him
to
the
quick
just
let
him
laugh
at
me
again
thought
gourlay
and
i
analyze
each
mean
quirk
of
his
dirty
soul
to
him
the
drink
was
dying
in
him
now
for
the
trio
had
walked
for
more
than
an
hour
through
the
open
air
when
they
left
gillespie
rooms
the
stupefaction
of
alcohol
was
gone
leaving
his
brain
morbidly
alive
he
was
anxious
to
sleep
but
drowsy
dullness
kept
away
his
mind
began
to
visualize
of
its
own
accord
independent
of
his
will
and
one
after
another
a
crowd
of
pictures
rose
vivid
in
the
darkness
of
his
brain
he
saw
them
as
plainly
as
you
see
this
page
but
with
a
different
clearness
for
they
seemed
unnatural
belonging
to
a
morbid
world
nor
did
one
suggest
the
other
there
was
no
connection
between
them
each
came
vivid
of
its
own
accord
first
it
was
an
old
on
a
barren
moor
gaunt
against
the
yellow
west
gourlay
saw
bars
of
iron
left
when
the
pit
was
abandoned
reddened
by
the
rain
and
the
mounds
of
rubbish
and
the
scattered
bricks
and
the
rusty
clinkers
from
the
furnace
and
the
melancholy
shining
pools
a
old
trolley
had
lost
two
of
its
wheels
and
was
tilted
at
a
slant
one
square
end
of
it
resting
on
the
ground
why
do
i
think
of
an
old
pit
he
thought
angrily
curse
it
why
i
sleep
next
moment
he
was
gazing
at
a
ruined
castle
its
mouldering
walls
mounded
atop
with
decaying
rubble
from
a
loose
crumb
of
mortar
a
long
thin
film
of
the
spider
weaving
stretched
bellying
away
to
a
tall
weed
waving
on
the
crazy
brink
gourlay
saw
its
glisten
in
the
wind
he
saw
each
crack
in
the
wall
each
stain
of
lichen
a
myriad
details
stamped
themselves
together
on
his
raw
mind
then
a
constant
procession
of
figures
passed
across
the
inner
curtain
of
his
closed
eyes
each
figure
was
cowled
but
when
it
came
directly
opposite
it
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
a
white
face
stop
stop
cried
his
mind
i
do
want
to
think
of
you
i
do
want
to
think
of
you
i
do
want
to
think
of
you
go
away
but
as
they
came
of
themselves
so
they
went
of
themselves
he
could
not
banish
them
he
turned
on
his
side
but
a
hundred
other
pictures
pursued
him
from
an
inland
hollow
he
saw
the
great
dawn
flooding
up
from
the
sea
over
a
sharp
line
of
cliff
wave
after
wave
of
brilliance
surging
up
the
heavens
the
landward
slope
of
the
cliff
was
gray
with
dew
the
inland
hollow
was
full
of
little
fields
divided
by
stone
walls
and
he
could
not
have
recalled
the
fields
round
barbie
with
half
their
distinctness
for
a
moment
they
possessed
his
brain
then
an
autumn
wood
rose
on
his
vision
he
was
gazing
down
a
vista
of
yellow
leaves
a
long
deep
slanting
cleft
framed
in
lit
foliage
leaves
leaves
everywhere
yellow
leaves
luminous
burning
he
saw
them
falling
through
the
lucid
air
the
scene
was
as
vivid
as
fire
to
his
brain
though
of
magic
stillness
then
the
foliage
changed
suddenly
to
great
serpents
twined
about
the
boughs
their
colours
were
of
monstrous
beauty
they
glistened
as
they
moved
he
leapt
in
his
bed
with
a
throb
of
horror
could
this
be
the
delirium
of
drink
but
no
he
had
often
had
an
experience
like
this
when
he
was
sleepless
he
had
the
learned
description
of
it
pat
and
ready
it
was
only
automatic
visualization
damn
why
could
he
sleep
he
flung
out
of
bed
uncorked
a
bottle
with
his
teeth
tilted
it
up
and
gulped
the
gurgling
fire
in
the
darkness
ha
that
was
better
his
room
was
already
gray
with
the
coming
dawn
he
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
the
town
was
stirring
uneasily
in
its
morning
sleep
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
train
was
shunting
clank
went
the
wagons
what
an
accursed
sound
a
dray
went
past
the
end
of
his
street
rumbling
hollowly
and
the
rumble
died
drearily
away
then
the
footsteps
of
an
early
workman
going
to
his
toil
were
heard
in
the
deserted
thoroughfare
gourlay
looked
down
and
saw
him
pass
far
beneath
him
on
the
glimmering
pavement
he
was
whistling
why
did
the
fool
whistle
what
had
he
got
to
whistle
about
it
was
unnatural
that
one
man
should
go
whistling
to
his
work
when
another
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
the
whole
night
long
he
took
another
vast
glut
of
whisky
and
the
moment
after
was
dead
to
the
world
he
was
awakened
at
eight
by
a
monstrous
hammering
on
his
door
by
the
excessive
loudness
of
the
first
knock
he
heard
on
returning
to
consciousness
he
knew
that
his
landlady
had
lost
her
temper
in
trying
to
get
him
up
ere
he
could
shout
she
had
thumped
again
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
in
sullen
misery
the
middle
of
his
tongue
was
as
dry
as
bark
for
his
breakfast
there
were
thick
slabs
of
rancid
bacon
from
the
top
of
which
two
yellow
eggs
had
spewed
themselves
away
among
the
cold
gravy
his
gorge
rose
at
them
he
nibbled
a
piece
of
dry
bread
and
drained
the
teapot
then
shouldering
into
his
greatcoat
he
tramped
off
to
the
university
it
was
a
wretched
morning
the
wind
had
veered
once
more
and
a
cold
drizzle
of
rain
was
falling
through
a
yellow
fog
the
reflections
of
the
street
lamps
in
the
sloppy
pavement
went
down
through
spiral
gleams
to
an
infinite
depth
of
misery
young
gourlay
brain
was
aching
from
his
last
night
debauch
and
his
body
was
weakened
with
the
want
both
of
sleep
and
food
the
cold
yellow
mist
chilled
him
to
the
bone
what
a
fool
i
was
to
get
drunk
last
night
he
thought
why
am
i
here
why
am
i
trudging
through
mud
and
misery
to
the
university
what
has
it
all
got
to
do
with
me
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
what
a
fool
drown
dull
care
said
the
devil
in
his
ear
he
took
a
sixpence
from
his
trousers
pocket
and
looked
down
at
the
white
bit
of
money
in
his
hand
till
it
was
wet
with
the
falling
rain
then
he
went
into
a
flashy
tavern
and
standing
by
a
sloppy
bar
drank
of
cheap
whisky
it
went
to
his
head
at
once
owing
to
his
want
of
food
and
with
a
dull
warm
feeling
in
his
body
he
lurched
off
to
his
first
lecture
for
the
day
his
outlook
on
the
world
had
changed
the
fog
was
now
a
comfortable
yellowness
freedom
and
whisky
gang
thegither
tak
aff
your
dram
he
quoted
to
his
own
mind
that
stuff
did
me
good
whisky
the
boy
to
fettle
you
he
was
in
his
element
the
moment
he
entered
the
classroom
it
was
a
bear
garden
the
most
moral
individual
has
his
days
of
perversity
when
a
malign
fate
compels
him
to
show
the
worst
he
has
in
him
a
scottish
university
class
which
is
many
most
moral
individuals
has
a
similar
eruptive
tendency
when
it
gets
into
the
hands
of
a
weak
professor
it
will
behave
well
enough
for
a
fortnight
then
a
morning
comes
when
nothing
can
control
it
this
was
a
morning
of
the
kind
the
lecturer
who
was
an
able
man
but
a
weakling
had
begun
by
apologizing
for
the
condition
of
his
voice
on
the
ground
that
he
had
a
bad
cold
instantly
every
man
in
the
class
was
blowing
his
nose
one
fellow
of
a
most
portentous
snout
who
could
trumpet
like
an
elephant
with
a
last
triumphant
snort
sent
his
handkerchief
across
the
room
when
called
to
account
for
his
conduct
really
sir
he
said
bad
cold
uprose
a
universal
sneeze
then
the
roughing
began
to
the
tune
of
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
grave
which
no
man
seemed
to
sing
but
every
man
could
hear
they
were
playing
the
tune
with
their
feet
the
lecturer
glared
with
white
repugnance
at
his
tormentors
young
gourlay
flung
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
cruel
baiting
it
was
partly
from
his
usual
love
of
showing
off
partly
from
the
drink
still
seething
within
him
but
largely
also
as
a
reaction
from
his
morning
misery
this
was
another
way
of
drowning
reflection
the
morbidly
gloomy
one
moment
often
shout
madly
on
the
next
at
last
the
lecturer
plunged
wildly
at
the
door
and
flung
it
open
go
he
shrieked
and
pointed
in
superb
dismissal
a
hundred
and
fifty
barbarians
sat
where
they
were
and
laughed
at
him
and
he
must
needs
come
back
to
the
platform
with
a
baffled
and
vindictive
glower
he
was
just
turning
as
it
chanced
when
young
gourlay
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
bellowed
ere
the
roar
could
swell
the
lecturer
had
leapt
to
the
front
of
the
rostrum
with
flaming
eyes
gourlay
he
screamed
furiously
you
there
sir
you
will
apologize
humbly
to
me
for
this
outrage
at
the
end
of
the
hour
there
was
a
womanish
shrillness
in
the
scream
a
kind
of
hysteria
on
the
stretch
that
contrasted
with
his
big
threat
might
have
provoked
them
at
other
times
to
a
roar
of
laughter
but
there
was
a
sincerity
in
his
rage
that
rose
above
its
faults
of
manner
and
an
immediate
silence
took
the
room
the
more
impressive
for
the
former
noise
every
eye
turned
to
gourlay
he
sat
gaping
at
the
lecturer
if
he
had
been
swept
to
the
anteroom
there
and
then
he
would
have
been
cowed
by
the
suddenness
of
his
own
change
from
a
loud
tormentor
in
the
company
of
others
to
a
silent
culprit
in
a
room
alone
and
apologies
would
have
been
ready
to
tumble
out
while
he
was
thus
loosened
by
surprise
and
fear
unluckily
he
had
time
to
think
and
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
sullen
he
became
it
was
only
an
accident
that
led
to
his
discovery
while
the
rest
escaped
and
that
the
others
should
escape
when
they
were
just
as
much
to
blame
as
he
was
was
an
injustice
that
made
him
furious
his
anger
was
equally
divided
between
the
cursed
mischance
itself
the
teacher
who
had
jumped
on
him
so
suddenly
and
the
other
rowdies
who
had
escaped
to
laugh
at
his
discomfiture
he
had
the
same
burning
resentment
to
them
all
when
he
thought
of
his
chuckling
they
seemed
to
engross
his
rage
when
he
thought
of
the
mishap
he
damned
it
and
nothing
else
when
he
thought
of
the
lecturer
he
felt
he
had
no
rage
to
fling
away
upon
others
the
snuffler
took
it
all
as
his
mind
shot
backwards
and
forwards
in
an
angry
gloom
it
suddenly
encountered
the
image
of
his
father
not
a
professor
of
the
lot
he
reflected
could
stand
the
look
of
black
gourlay
and
he
would
knuckle
under
either
so
he
would
he
came
of
a
hardy
stock
he
would
show
them
he
was
going
to
lick
dirt
for
any
man
let
him
punish
all
or
none
for
they
had
all
been
kicking
up
a
row
why
big
cunningham
had
been
braying
like
an
ass
only
a
minute
before
he
spied
armstrong
and
gillespie
glinting
across
at
him
with
a
curious
look
they
were
wondering
whether
he
had
courage
enough
to
stand
to
his
guns
with
a
professor
he
knew
the
meaning
of
the
look
and
resented
it
he
was
on
his
mettle
before
them
it
seemed
the
fellow
who
had
swaggered
at
the
howff
last
night
about
what
would
do
if
a
professor
jumped
on
must
prove
wanting
in
the
present
trial
beneath
the
eyes
of
those
on
whom
he
had
imposed
his
blatancy
when
we
think
of
what
gourlay
did
that
day
we
must
remember
that
he
was
soaked
in
alcohol
not
merely
with
his
morning
potation
but
with
the
dregs
of
previous
carousals
and
the
dregs
of
drink
a
thorough
toper
will
tell
you
never
leave
him
he
is
drunk
on
monday
with
his
saturday
debauch
as
drucken
wabster
of
barbie
put
it
once
when
a
body
hard
up
his
braith
a
consolation
if
that
be
so
and
wabster
remember
was
an
expert
whose
opinion
on
this
matter
is
entitled
to
the
highest
credence
if
that
be
so
it
proves
the
strength
and
persistence
of
a
thorough
alcoholic
impregnation
or
as
wabster
called
it
of
a
good
soak
in
young
gourlay
case
at
any
rate
the
impregnation
was
enduring
and
complete
he
was
like
a
rag
steeped
in
fusel
oil
as
the
end
of
the
hour
drew
near
he
sank
deeper
in
his
dogged
sullenness
when
the
class
streamed
from
the
large
door
on
the
right
he
turned
aside
to
the
little
anteroom
on
the
left
with
an
insolent
swing
of
the
shoulders
he
knew
the
fellows
were
watching
him
curiously
he
felt
their
eyes
upon
his
back
and
therefore
as
he
went
through
the
little
door
he
stood
for
a
moment
on
his
right
foot
and
waggled
his
left
on
a
level
with
his
hip
behind
in
a
vulgar
derision
of
them
the
professor
and
the
whole
situation
that
was
a
fine
taunt
flung
back
at
them
there
is
nothing
on
earth
more
vindictive
than
a
weakling
when
he
gets
a
chance
he
takes
revenge
for
everything
his
past
cowardice
forced
him
to
endure
the
timid
lecturer
angry
at
the
poor
figure
he
had
cut
on
the
platform
was
glad
to
take
it
out
of
young
gourlay
for
the
wrongdoing
of
the
class
gourlay
was
their
scapegoat
the
lecturer
had
no
longer
over
a
hundred
men
to
deal
with
but
one
lout
only
sullen
yet
shrinking
in
the
room
before
him
instead
of
coming
to
the
point
at
once
he
played
with
his
victim
it
was
less
from
intentional
cruelty
than
from
an
instinctive
desire
to
recover
his
lost
feeling
of
superiority
the
class
was
his
master
but
here
was
one
of
them
he
could
cow
at
any
rate
well
he
asked
bringing
his
thin
together
and
flinging
one
thigh
across
the
other
gourlay
shuffled
his
feet
uneasily
yes
inquired
the
other
enjoying
his
discomfiture
gourlay
lowered
whatna
gate
was
this
to
gang
on
why
could
he
let
a
blatter
out
of
his
thin
mouth
and
ha
done
i
waiting
said
the
lecturer
the
words
i
apologize
rose
in
gourlay
but
refused
to
pass
his
throat
no
he
would
so
he
would
he
would
see
the
lecturer
far
enough
ere
he
gave
an
apology
before
it
was
expressly
required
oh
that
the
line
you
go
on
is
it
said
the
lecturer
nodding
his
head
as
if
he
had
sized
up
a
curious
animal
i
see
i
see
you
add
contumacy
to
insolence
do
you
imphm
gourlay
was
not
quite
sure
what
contumacy
meant
and
the
uncertainty
added
to
his
anger
there
were
others
making
a
noise
besides
me
he
blurted
i
do
see
why
should
be
blamed
for
it
all
oh
you
do
see
why
should
be
had
up
indeed
i
think
bring
you
to
a
different
conclusion
yes
i
think
so
gourlay
being
forced
to
stand
always
on
the
one
spot
felt
himself
swaying
in
a
drunken
stupor
he
blinked
at
the
lecturer
like
an
angry
owl
the
blinking
regard
of
a
sodden
mind
yet
fiery
with
a
spiteful
rage
his
wrath
was
rising
and
falling
like
a
quick
tide
he
would
have
liked
one
moment
to
give
a
rein
to
the
gourlay
temper
and
let
the
lecturer
have
it
hot
and
strong
the
next
he
was
quivering
in
a
cowardly
horror
of
the
desperate
attempt
he
had
so
nearly
made
curse
his
tormentor
why
did
he
keep
him
here
when
his
head
was
aching
so
badly
another
taunt
was
enough
to
spring
his
drunken
rage
i
wonder
what
you
think
you
came
to
college
for
said
the
lecturer
i
have
been
looking
at
your
records
in
the
class
they
the
worst
i
ever
saw
and
you
not
content
with
that
it
seems
you
add
misbehaviour
to
gross
stupidity
to
hell
wi
ye
said
gourlay
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
room
as
if
the
air
was
stunned
the
silence
throbbed
the
lecturer
who
had
risen
sat
down
suddenly
as
if
going
at
the
knees
and
went
white
about
the
gills
some
men
would
have
swept
the
ruffian
with
a
burst
of
generous
wrath
a
few
might
have
pitied
in
their
anger
but
this
young
solomon
was
thin
and
acid
a
vindictive
rat
unable
to
cow
the
insolent
in
present
and
rage
he
fell
to
thinking
of
the
great
machine
he
might
set
in
motion
to
destroy
him
as
he
sat
there
in
silence
his
eyes
grew
ferrety
and
a
sleek
revenge
peeped
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
i
show
him
what
i
do
to
him
for
this
is
a
translation
of
his
thought
he
was
thinking
with
great
satisfaction
to
himself
of
how
the
senatus
would
deal
with
young
gourlay
gourlay
grew
weak
with
fear
the
moment
the
words
escaped
him
they
had
been
a
thunderclap
to
his
own
ears
he
had
been
thinking
them
but
as
he
pleaded
far
within
him
now
had
never
meant
to
utter
them
they
had
been
mere
spume
off
the
surge
of
cowardly
wrath
seething
up
within
him
longing
to
burst
but
afraid
it
was
the
taunt
of
stupidity
that
fired
his
drunken
vanity
to
blurt
them
forth
the
lecturer
eyed
him
sideways
where
he
shrank
in
fear
you
may
go
he
said
at
last
i
will
report
your
conduct
to
the
university
gourlay
was
sitting
alone
in
his
room
when
he
heard
that
he
had
been
expelled
for
many
days
he
had
drunk
to
deaden
fear
but
he
was
sober
now
being
newly
out
of
bed
a
dreary
ray
of
sunshine
came
through
the
window
and
fell
on
a
wisp
of
flame
blinking
in
the
grate
as
gourlay
sat
his
eyes
fixed
dully
on
the
faded
ray
a
flash
of
intuition
laid
his
character
bare
to
him
he
read
himself
ruthlessly
it
was
not
by
conscious
effort
insight
was
uncanny
and
apart
from
will
he
saw
that
blatancy
had
joined
with
weakness
morbidity
with
want
of
brains
and
that
the
results
of
these
converging
to
a
point
had
produced
the
present
issue
his
expulsion
his
mind
recognized
how
logical
the
issue
was
assenting
wearily
as
to
a
problem
proved
given
those
qualities
in
those
circumstances
what
else
could
have
happened
and
such
a
weakling
as
he
knew
himself
to
be
could
never
he
thought
make
effort
sufficient
to
alter
his
qualities
a
sense
of
fatalism
came
over
him
as
of
one
doomed
he
bowed
his
head
and
let
his
arms
fall
by
the
sides
of
his
chair
dropping
them
like
a
spent
swimmer
ready
to
sink
the
sudden
revelation
of
himself
to
himself
had
taken
the
heart
out
of
him
i
a
waster
he
said
aghast
and
then
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
a
fear
came
over
him
a
fear
of
his
own
nature
and
he
started
to
his
feet
and
strode
feverishly
as
if
by
mere
locomotion
to
escape
from
his
clinging
and
inherent
ill
it
was
as
if
he
were
trying
to
run
away
from
himself
he
faced
round
at
the
mirror
on
his
mantel
and
looked
at
his
own
image
with
staring
and
startled
eyes
his
mouth
open
the
breath
coming
hard
through
his
nostrils
you
a
gey
ill
ane
he
said
you
a
gey
ill
ane
my
god
where
have
you
landed
yourself
he
went
out
to
escape
from
his
thoughts
instinctively
he
turned
to
the
howff
for
consolation
with
the
panic
despair
of
the
weak
he
abandoned
hope
of
his
character
at
its
first
collapse
and
plunged
into
a
wild
debauch
to
avoid
reflecting
where
it
would
lead
him
in
the
end
but
he
had
a
more
definite
reason
for
prolonging
his
bout
in
edinburgh
he
was
afraid
to
go
home
and
meet
his
father
he
shrank
in
visioning
fear
before
the
dour
face
loaded
with
scorn
that
would
swing
round
to
meet
him
as
he
entered
through
the
door
though
he
swore
every
night
in
his
cups
that
he
would
square
up
to
the
governor
the
morn
so
he
would
always
when
the
cold
light
came
fear
of
the
interview
drove
him
to
his
cups
again
his
courage
zigzagged
as
it
always
did
one
moment
he
towered
in
imagination
the
next
he
grovelled
in
fear
sometimes
when
he
was
fired
with
whisky
another
element
entered
into
his
mood
no
less
big
with
destruction
it
was
all
his
father
fault
for
sending
him
to
edinburgh
and
no
matter
what
happened
it
would
serve
the
old
fellow
right
he
had
a
kind
of
fierce
satisfaction
in
his
own
ruin
because
his
ruin
would
show
them
at
home
what
a
mistake
they
had
made
in
sending
him
to
college
it
was
the
old
man
tyranny
in
forcing
him
to
college
that
had
brought
all
this
on
his
miserable
head
well
he
was
damned
glad
so
he
was
that
they
should
be
punished
at
home
by
their
own
foolish
scheme
it
had
punished
enough
for
one
and
then
he
would
set
his
mouth
insolent
and
hard
and
drink
the
more
fiercely
finding
a
consolation
in
the
thought
that
his
tyrannical
father
would
suffer
through
his
degradation
too
at
last
he
must
go
home
he
drifted
to
the
station
aimlessly
he
had
ceased
to
be
his
compartment
happened
to
be
empty
so
free
to
behave
as
he
liked
he
yelled
snatches
in
a
tuneless
voice
hammering
with
his
feet
on
the
wooden
floor
the
noise
pleased
his
sodden
mind
which
had
narrowed
to
a
comfortable
stupor
outside
of
which
his
troubles
seemed
to
lie
as
if
they
belonged
not
to
him
but
to
somebody
else
with
the
same
sodden
interest
he
was
staring
through
the
window
at
one
of
the
little
stations
on
the
line
when
a
boy
pointing
said
white
nose
and
gourlay
laughed
uproariously
adding
at
the
end
he
a
clever
chield
that
my
nose
look
flat
and
white
against
the
pane
but
this
outbreak
of
mirth
seemed
to
break
in
on
his
comfortable
vagueness
it
roused
him
by
a
kind
of
reaction
to
think
of
home
and
of
what
his
father
would
say
a
minute
after
he
had
been
laughing
so
madly
he
was
staring
sullenly
in
front
of
him
well
it
did
matter
it
was
all
the
old
fellow
fault
and
he
was
going
to
stand
any
of
his
jaw
none
of
your
jaw
john
gourlay
he
said
nodding
his
head
viciously
and
thrusting
out
his
clenched
fist
none
of
your
jaw
d
hear
he
crept
into
barbie
through
the
dusk
it
had
been
and
knots
of
people
were
still
about
the
streets
gourlay
stole
softly
through
the
shadows
and
turned
his
high
about
his
ears
he
nearly
ran
into
two
men
who
were
talking
apart
and
his
heart
stopped
dead
at
their
words
no
no
gourlay
said
one
of
them
it
quite
impossible
i
not
unwilling
to
oblige
ye
but
i
can
not
take
the
risk
john
heard
the
mumble
of
his
father
voice
well
said
the
other
reluctantly
if
ye
get
the
baker
and
tam
wylie
for
security
i
be
on
the
street
for
another
another
thought
john
with
relief
he
would
not
have
to
face
his
father
the
moment
he
went
in
he
would
be
able
to
get
home
before
him
he
crept
on
through
the
gloaming
to
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
chapter
xxiv
there
had
been
fine
cackling
in
barbie
as
gourlay
men
dropped
away
from
him
one
by
one
and
now
it
was
worse
than
ever
when
jimmy
bain
and
sandy
cross
were
dismissed
last
winter
he
canna
last
long
now
mused
the
bodies
and
then
when
even
riney
got
the
sack
lord
they
cried
this
maun
be
the
end
the
downfall
of
gourlay
had
an
unholy
fascination
for
his
neighbours
and
that
not
merely
because
of
their
dislike
to
the
man
that
was
a
whet
to
their
curiosity
of
course
but
over
and
above
it
they
seemed
to
be
watching
with
bated
breath
for
the
final
collapse
of
an
edifice
that
was
bound
to
fall
simple
expectation
held
them
it
was
a
dramatic
interest
of
suspense
yet
certainty
that
had
them
in
its
grip
he
to
come
down
said
certainty
yes
but
though
cried
curiosity
all
the
more
eager
because
of
its
instinct
for
the
coming
crash
and
so
they
waited
for
the
great
catastrophe
which
they
felt
to
be
so
near
it
was
as
if
they
were
watching
the
tragedy
near
at
hand
and
noting
with
keen
interest
every
step
in
it
that
must
lead
to
inevitable
ruin
that
invariably
happens
when
a
family
tragedy
is
played
out
in
the
midst
of
a
small
community
each
step
in
it
is
discussed
with
a
prying
interest
that
is
neither
malevolent
nor
sympathetic
but
simply
curious
in
this
case
it
was
chiefly
malevolent
only
because
gourlay
had
been
such
a
brute
to
barbie
though
there
were
thus
two
reasons
for
public
interest
the
result
was
one
and
the
same
a
constant
particular
spite
and
a
more
general
curiosity
brought
the
grain
merchant
name
on
to
every
tongue
not
even
in
the
gawcey
days
of
its
prosperity
had
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
been
so
much
talked
of
pride
have
a
downcome
said
some
with
a
gleg
look
and
a
smack
of
the
lip
trying
to
veil
their
personal
malevolence
in
a
common
proverb
he
simply
in
debt
in
every
corner
goldered
the
keener
spirits
he
never
had
a
brain
for
business
he
had
money
for
stuff
he
unable
to
deliver
not
a
day
gangs
by
but
the
big
blue
envelopes
are
coming
how
do
i
ken
say
ye
how
do
i
ken
indeed
i
ken
perfectly
perfectly
it
was
postie
himsell
that
telled
me
yet
all
this
was
merely
guesswork
for
gourlay
had
hitherto
gone
away
from
barbie
for
his
moneys
and
accommodations
so
that
the
bodies
could
only
surmise
they
had
nothing
definite
to
go
on
and
through
it
all
the
gurly
old
fellow
kept
a
brave
front
to
the
world
he
was
thinking
of
retiring
he
said
and
gradually
drawing
in
his
business
this
offhand
and
lordly
to
hide
the
patent
diminution
of
his
trade
said
the
old
provost
with
a
cruel
laugh
when
he
heard
of
gourlay
remark
drawing
in
his
business
ay
it
like
lang
jean
lingleton
waist
i
thinking
it
thin
eneugh
drawn
on
the
morning
of
the
last
he
was
ever
to
see
in
barbie
old
gourlay
was
standing
at
the
green
gate
when
the
postman
came
up
with
a
smirk
and
put
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
betrayed
a
wish
to
hover
in
gossip
while
gourlay
opened
his
letter
but
less
lip
said
surly
john
and
the
fellow
went
away
ere
he
had
reached
the
corner
a
gowl
of
anger
and
grief
struck
his
ear
and
he
wheeled
eagerly
gourlay
was
standing
with
open
mouth
and
outstretched
arm
staring
at
the
letter
in
his
clenched
fist
with
a
look
of
horror
as
if
it
had
stung
him
my
god
he
cried
had
not
enough
to
thole
aha
thought
postie
yon
letter
wilson
got
this
morning
was
correct
then
his
son
had
sent
the
true
story
that
letter
o
gourlay
had
the
edinburgh
postmark
somebody
has
sent
him
word
about
his
lord
what
a
for
my
rounds
gourlay
who
was
washing
dishes
looked
up
to
see
her
husband
standing
in
the
kitchen
door
his
face
frightened

she
had
often

blaze
in

eye
and
often
the
dark
scowl
but
never
this
bloodless
pallor
in
his
cheek
yet
his
eyes
were
flaming
ay

birred

made

oh

imperious
in

of
appeal
oh

she
stretched
out
her
thin
red
hands
and
clasped
them
tightly
before

is
there
ainything
the

with

the
hard
eye
surveyed
her
a
while
in
grim
contempt
of
her
weakness
she
was
a
fluttering
thing
in
his
grip
thing
the
matter
with

he
sneered
slowly
thing
the
matter
with
boy
and
it
your
fault
too
damn
you
for
you
always
spoiled
him
with
sudden
wrath
he
strode
over
to
the
famous
range
and
threw
the
letter
within
the
great
fender
what
is
it
he
cried
wheeling
round
on
his
wife
the
son
you
were
so
wild
about
sending
to
college
has
been
flung
in
disgrace
from
its
door
that
what
it
is
he
swept
from
the
house
like
a
madman
gourlay
sank
into
her
old
nursing
chair
and
wailed
oh
my
wean
my
wean
my
dear
my
poor
dear
she
drew
the
letter
from
the
ashes
but
could
not
read
it
for
her
tears
the
words
drunkenness
and
expulsion
swam
before
her
eyes
the
manner
of
his
disgrace
she
did
not
care
to
hear
she
only
knew
her
was
in
sorrow
oh
my
son
my
son
she
cried
my
laddie
my
wee
laddie
she
was
thinking
of
the
time
when
he
trotted
at
her
petticoat
it
was
and
gourlay
must
face
the
town
there
was
interest
due
on
a
mortgage
which
he
could
not
pay
he
must
swallow
his
pride
and
try
to
borrow
it
in
barbie
he
thought
of
trying
johnny
coe
for
johnny
was
of
yielding
nature
and
had
never
been
unfriendly
he
turned
twenty
yards
from
his
gate
and
looked
at
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
he
had
often
turned
to
look
back
with
pride
at
the
gawcey
building
on
its
terrace
but
never
as
he
looked
all
that
his
life
meant
was
bound
up
in
that
house
it
had
been
the
pride
of
the
gourlays
now
it
was
no
longer
his
and
the
gourlays
pride
was
in
the
dust
their
name
a
as
gourlay
looked
a
robin
was
perched
on
the
quiet
its
breast
vivid
in
the
sun
one
of
his
metaphors
flashed
at
the
sight
shame
is
sitting
there
too
he
muttered
and
added
with
a
proud
angry
snarl
on
the
riggin
o
hoose
he
had
a
triple
wrath
to
his
son
he
had
not
only
ruined
his
own
life
he
had
destroyed
his
father
hope
that
by
entering
the
ministry
he
might
restore
the
gourlay
reputation
above
all
he
had
disgraced
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
that
was
the
crown
of
his
offending
gourlay
felt
for
the
house
of
his
pride
even
more
than
for
himself
rather
the
house
was
himself
there
was
no
division
between
them
he
had
built
it
bluff
to
represent
him
to
the
world
it
was
his
character
in
stone
and
lime
he
clung
to
it
as
the
dull
fierce
mind
unable
to
live
in
thought
clings
to
a
material
source
of
pride
and
john
had
disgraced
it
even
if
fortune
took
a
turn
for
the
better
green
shutters
would
be
laughed
at
the
country
over
as
the
home
of
a
prodigal
as
he
went
by
the
cross
wilson
provost
this
long
while
broke
off
a
conversation
with
templandmuir
to
yell
it
weather
mr
gourlay
the
men
had
not
spoken
for
years
so
to
shout
at
poor
gourlay
in
his
black
hour
from
the
pinnacle
of
civic
greatness
was
a
fine
stroke
it
was
gloating
it
was
rubbing
in
the
contrast
the
words
were
innocent
but
that
was
nothing
whatever
the
remark
for
a
declared
enemy
to
address
gourlay
in
his
shame
was
an
insult
that
was
why
wilson
addressed
him
there
was
something
in
the
very
loudness
of
his
tones
that
cried
plainly
aha
gourlay
your
son
has
disgraced
you
my
man
gourlay
glowered
at
the
animal
and
plodded
dourly
ere
he
had
gone
ten
yards
a
coarse
laugh
came
bellowing
behind
him
they
saw
the
colour
surge
up
the
back
of
his
neck
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
he
stopped
was
his
son
disgrace
known
in
barbie
already
he
had
hoped
to
get
through
the
without
anybody
knowing
but
wilson
had
a
son
in
edinburgh
he
had
written
it
was
like
the
salutation
therefore
and
the
laugh
had
both
been
uttered
in
derision
he
wheeled
his
face
black
with
the
passionate
blood
his
mouth
yawed
with
anger
his
voice
had
a
moan
of
intensity
what
are
laughing
at
he
said
with
a
mastering
quietness
eh
just
tell
me
please
what
you
laughing
at
he
was
crouching
for
the
grip
his
hands
out
like
a
gorilla
the
quiet
voice
from
the
yawing
mouth
beneath
the
steady
flaming
eyes
was
deadly
there
is
something
inhuman
in
a
rage
so
still
eh
he
said
slowly
and
the
moan
seemed
to
come
from
the
midst
of
a
vast
intensity
rather
than
a
human
being
it
was
the
question
that
must
grind
an
answer
wilson
was
wishing
to
all
his
gods
that
he
had
not
insulted
this
awful
man
he
remembered
what
had
happened
to
gibson
this
he
had
heard
was
the
very
voice
with
which
gourlay
moaned
take
your
hand
off
shouther
ere
he
hurled
gibson
through
the
window
of
the
red
lion
barbie
might
soon
want
a
new
provost
if
he
ran
in
now
but
there
is
always
one
way
of
evading
punishment
for
a
veiled
insult
and
of
adding
to
its
sting
by
your
evasion
repudiate
the
remotest
thought
of
the
protester
thus
you
enjoy
your
previous
gibe
with
the
additional
pleasure
of
making
your
victim
seem
a
fool
for
thinking
you
referred
to
him
you
not
only
insult
him
on
the
first
count
but
send
him
off
with
an
additional
hint
that
he
is
worth
your
notice
wilson
was
an
adept
in
the
art
man
he
lied
blandly
but
his
voice
was
quivering
i
so
much
as
giving
ye
a
thoat
it
verra
strange
if
i
can
not
pass
a
joke
with
my
friend
templandmuir
without
calling
me
to
book
a
free
country
i
shuppose
ye
were
in
my
mind
at
i
have
more
important
matters
to
think
of
he
ventured
to
add
seeing
he
had
baffled
gourlay
for
gourlay
was
baffled
for
a
directer
insult
an
offensive
gesture
one
fierce
word
he
would
have
hammered
the
road
with
the
provost
but
he
was
helpless
before
the
bland
quivering
lie
maybe
they
werena
referring
to
him
maybe
they
knew
nothing
of
john
in
edinburgh
maybe
he
had
been
foolishly
suspeecious
a
subtle
yet
baffling
check
was
put
upon
his
anger
madman
as
he
was
in
wrath
he
never
struck
without
direct
provocation
there
was
none
in
this
pulpy
gentleness
and
he
was
too
dull
of
wit
to
get
round
the
common
ruse
and
find
a
means
of
getting
at
them
he
let
loose
a
great
breath
through
his
nostrils
as
if
releasing
a
deadly
force
which
he
had
pent
within
him
ready
should
he
need
to
spring
his
mouth
opened
again
and
he
gaped
at
them
with
a
great
round
unseeing
stare
then
he
swung
on
his
heel
but
wrath
clung
round
him
like
a
garment
his
anger
fed
on
its
uncertainties
for
that
is
the
beauty
of
the
wilson
method
of
insult
you
leave
the
poison
in
your
victim
blood
and
he
torments
himself
was
wilson
referring
to
after
all
he
pondered
slowly
and
his
body
surged
at
the
thought
if
he
was
i
have
let
him
get
away
unkilled
and
he
clutched
the
hands
whence
wilson
had
escaped
suddenly
a
flashing
thought
stopped
him
dead
in
the
middle
of
his
walk
staring
hornily
before
him
he
had
seen
the
point
at
last
that
a
quicker
man
would
have
seized
on
at
the
first
why
had
wilson
thrust
his
damned
voice
on
him
on
this
particular
morning
of
all
days
in
the
year
if
he
was
not
gloating
over
some
news
which
he
had
just
heard
about
the
gourlays
it
was
as
plain
as
daylight
his
son
had
sent
word
from
edinburgh
that
was
why
he
brayed
and
when
gourlay
went
by
gourlay
felt
a
great
flutter
of
pulses
against
his
collar
there
was
a
pain
in
his
throat
an
ache
of
madness
in
his
breast
he
turned
once
more
but
wilson
and
the
templar
had
withdrawn
discreetly
to
the
black
bull
the
street
wasna
canny
gourlay
resumed
his
way
his
being
a
dumb
gowl
of
rage
his
angry
thought
swept
to
john
each
insult
and
fancied
insult
he
endured
that
day
was
another
item
in
the
long
account
of
vengeance
with
his
son
it
was
john
who
had
brought
all
this
flaming
round
his
ears
john
whose
colleging
he
had
lippened
to
so
muckle
the
staff
on
which
he
leaned
had
pierced
him
by
the
eternal
heavens
he
would
tramp
it
into
atoms
his
legs
felt
john
beneath
them
as
the
market
grew
busy
gourlay
was
the
aim
of
innumerable
eyes
he
would
turn
his
head
to
find
himself
the
object
of
a
queer
considering
look
then
the
eyes
of
the
starer
would
flutter
abashed
as
though
detected
spying
the
forbidden
the
most
innocent
look
at
him
was
poison
do
they
know
was
his
constant
thought
have
they
heard
the
news
what
loranogie
looking
at
me
like
that
for
not
a
man
ventured
to
address
him
about
john
he
had
cowed
them
too
long
one
man
however
showed
a
wish
to
try
a
pretended
sympathy
from
behind
the
veil
of
which
you
probe
a
man
anguish
at
your
ease
is
a
favourite
weapon
of
human
beasts
anxious
to
wound
the
deacon
longed
to
try
it
on
gourlay
but
his
courage
failed
him
it
was
the
only
time
he
was
ever
worsted
in
malignity
never
a
man
went
forth
bowed
down
with
a
recent
shame
wounded
and
wincing
from
the
public
gaze
but
that
old
rogue
hirpled
up
to
him
and
lisped
with
false
smoothness
thirce
me
neebour
i
thorry
for
ye
thith
ith
a
affair
on
tongue
but
ye
have
my
thympathy
neebour
ye
have
my
warmetht
thympathy
and
all
the
while
the
shifty
eyes
above
the
lying
mouth
would
peer
and
probe
to
see
if
the
soul
within
the
other
was
writhing
at
his
words
now
though
everybody
was
spying
at
gourlay
in
the
market
all
were
giving
him
a
wide
berth
for
they
knew
that
he
was
dangerous
he
was
no
longer
the
man
whom
they
had
baited
on
the
way
to
skeighan
then
he
had
some
control
now
three
years
calamities
had
fretted
his
temper
to
a
raw
wound
to
flick
it
was
perilous
great
was
the
surprise
of
the
starers
therefore
when
the
idle
old
deacon
was
seen
to
detach
himself
and
hail
the
grain
merchant
gourlay
wheeled
and
waited
with
a
levelled
eye
all
were
agog
at
the
sight
something
would
be
sure
to
come
this
here
would
be
an
encounter
worth
the
speaking
o
but
the
deacon
having
toddled
forward
a
bittock
on
his
thin
shanks
stopped
took
snuff
trumpeted
into
his
big
red
handkerchief
and
then
feebly
waving
i
thee
ye
again
dyohn
clean
turned
tail
and
toddled
back
to
his
cronies
a
roar
went
up
at
his
expense
god
said
tam
wylie
did
ye
see
yon
gourlay
stopped
him
wi
a
glower
but
the
laugh
was
maddening
to
gourlay
its
readiness
its
volume
showed
him
that
scores
of
folk
had
him
in
their
minds
were
watching
him
considering
his
position
cognizant
of
where
he
stood
they
ken
he
thought
they
were
a
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
they
wanted
to
watch
how
gourlay
tholed
the
mention
o
his
son
disgrace
i
a
kind
o
show
to
them
johnny
coe
idle
and
though
he
had
no
business
of
his
own
to
attend
to
was
always
present
where
business
men
assembled
it
was
a
way
of
getting
news
however
gourlay
could
not
find
him
he
went
into
the
cattle
mart
to
see
if
he
was
there
for
two
years
now
barbie
had
a
market
for
cattle
on
the
first
tuesday
of
the
month
the
auctioneer
a
jovial
dog
was
in
the
middle
of
his
roaring
game
a
big
red
bullock
the
coat
of
which
made
a
rich
colour
in
the
ring
came
bounding
in
scared
at
its
surroundings
staring
one
moment
and
the
next
careering
there

he
of
the
hammer

tone
of
voice

going
at
gone
irrendavie
now
that
he
was
in
the
circle
however
the
mad
big
handsome
beast
refused
to
go
out
again
when
the
cattlemen
would
drive
him
to
the
yard
he
snorted
and
galloped
round
till
he
had
to
be
driven
from
the
ring
with
blows
when
at
last
he
bounded
through
the
door
he
flung
up
his
heels
with
a
bellow
and
sent
the
sand
of
his
arena
showering
on
the
people
round
i
seh
roared
brodie
in
his
coarsest
voice
from
the
side
of
the
ring
opposite
to
gourlay
i
seh
owctioner
that
maun
be
a
stot
from
the
way
he
behaves
he
flung
dirt
at
his
masters
and
had
to
be
expelled
put
brodie
in
the
ring
and
rowp
him
cried
irrendavie
he
roars
like
a
bill
at
ony
rate
there
was
a
laugh
at
brodie
true
but
it
was
at
gourlay
that
a
hundred
big
red
faces
turned
to
look
he
did
not
look
at
them
though
he
sent
his
eyes
across
the
ring
at
brodie
lord
said
irrendavie
it
weel
for
brodie
that
the
ring
acqueesh
them
gourlay
murder
somebody
yet
red
hell
lap
out
o
his
when
he
looked
at
brodie
gourlay
suspicion
that
his
son
disgrace
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
had
now
become
a
certainty
brodie
taunt
showed
that
everybody
knew
it
he
walked
out
of
the
building
very
quietly
pale
but
resolute
no
meanness
in
his
carriage
no
cowering
he
was
an
arresting
figure
of
a
man
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
door
and
looked
round
for
the
man
whom
he
was
seeking
weel
weel
he
was
thinking
i
maun
thole
i
suppose
they
were
under
feet
for
many
a
day
and
taking
their
advantage
now
but
though
he
could
thole
his
anger
against
john
was
none
the
less
it
was
because
they
had
been
under
his
feet
for
many
a
day
that
conduct
was
the
more
heinous
it
was
his
son
conduct
that
gave
gourlay
enemies
their
first
opportunity
against
him
that
enabled
them
to
turn
the
tables
they
might
sneer
at
his
trollop
of
a
wife
they
might
sneer
at
his
want
of
mere
cleverness
still
he
held
his
head
high
amongst
them
they
might
suspect
his
poverty
but
so
far
for
anything
they
knew
he
might
have
thousands
behind
him
he
owed
not
a
man
in
barbie
the
appointments
of
green
shutters
were
as
brave
as
ever
the
selling
of
his
horses
the
dismissal
of
his
men
might
mean
the
completion
of
a
fortune
not
its
loss
hitherto
then
he
was
invulnerable
so
he
reasoned
it
was
his
son
disgrace
that
gave
the
men
he
had
trodden
under
foot
the
first
weapon
they
could
use
against
him
that
was
why
it
was
more
damnable
in
gourlay
eyes
than
the
conduct
of
all
the
prodigals
that
ever
lived
it
had
enabled
his
foes
to
get
their
knife
into
him
at
last
and
they
were
turning
the
dagger
in
the
wound
all
owing
to
the
boy
on
whom
he
had
staked
such
hopes
of
keeping
up
the
gourlay
name
his
account
with
john
was
lengthening
steadily
coe
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
at
last
gourlay
made
up
his
mind
to
go
out
and
make
inquiries
at
his
house
out
the
fleckie
road
it
was
a
quiet
big
house
standing
by
itself
and
gourlay
was
glad
there
was
nobody
to
see
him
it
was
miss
coe
herself
who
answered
his
knock
at
the
door
she
was
a
withered
old
shrew
with
fifty
times
the
spunk
of
johnny
on
her
thin
wrists
and
long
hands
there
was
always
a
pair
of
bright
red
mittens
only
her
showing
her
and
toothless
mouth
was
always
working
with
a
sucking
motion
of
the
lips
and
her
round
little
knob
of
a
chin
munched
up
and
down
when
she
spoke
a
long
stiff
whitish
hair
slanting
out
its
middle
however
much
you
wished
to
avoid
doing
so
you
could
not
keep
your
eyes
from
staring
at
that
solitary
hair
while
she
was
addressing
you
it
worked
up
and
down
so
keeping
time
to
every
word
she
spoke
is
your
brother
in
said
gourlay
he
was
too
near
reality
in
this
sad
pass
of
his
to
think
of
mistering
is
your
brother
in
said
he
she
shrilled
for
miss
coe
answered
questions
with
an
scream
as
if
the
news
she
was
giving
must
be
a
great
surprise
both
to
you
and
her
she
skirled
he
was
it
ainything
particular
no
said
gourlay
heavily
i
i
just
wanted
to
see
him
and
he
trudged
away
miss
coe
looked
after
him
for
a
moment
ere
she
closed
the
door
wanting
to
barrow
money
she
cried
i
nearly
sure
i
maun
caution
johnny
when
he
comes
back
frae
fleckie
afore
he
gangs
east
the
toon
gourlay
could
get
him
to
do
ocht
he
always
admired
the
brute
sure
i
kenna
why
because
he
siccan
a
silly
body
himsell
i
suppose
it
was
after
dark
when
gourlay
met
coe
on
the
street
he
drew
him
aside
in
the
shadows
and
asked
for
a
loan
of
eighty
pounds
johnny
stammered
a
refusal
hauf
the
bawbees
is
mine
his
sister
had
skirled
and
i
daur
ye
to
do
ony
siccan
thing
john
coe
it
only
for
a
time
pleaded
gourlay
and
by
god
he
flashed
it
hell
in
throat
to
ask
from
any
man
no
no
gourlay
said
johnny
it
quite
impossible
i
always
looked
up
to
ye
and
i
not
unwilling
to
oblige
ye
but
i
can
not
take
the
risk
risk
said
gourlay
and
stared
at
the
darkness
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
must
raise
the
money
to
save
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
it
was
no
use
trying
the
bank
he
had
a
letter
from
the
banker
in
his
desk
to
tell
him
that
his
account
was
overdrawn
and
yet
if
the
interest
were
not
paid
at
once
the
lawyers
in
glasgow
would
foreclose
and
the
gourlays
would
be
flung
upon
the
street
his
proud
soul
must
eat
dirt
if
need
be
for
the
sake
of
eighty
pounds
if
i
get
the
baker
or
tam
wylie
to
stand
security
he
asked
would
ye
not
oblige
me
i
think
they
would
do
it
i
have
always
felt
they
respected
me
well
said
johnny
slowly
fearing
his
sister
anger
if
ye
get
the
baker
and
tam
wylie
for
security
i
be
on
the
street
for
another
a
figure
muffled
in
a
greatcoat
was
seen
stealing
off
through
the
shadows
god
curse
on
whoever
that
is
snarled
gourlay
creeping
up
to
listen
to
our
talk
i
do
think
so
said
johnny
it
seemed
a
young
chap
trying
to
hide
himself
gourlay
failed
to
get
his
securities
the
baker
though
a
poor
man
would
have
stood
for
him
if
tam
wylie
would
have
joined
but
tam
would
not
budge
he
was
as
clean
as
gray
granite
and
as
hard
so
gourlay
trudged
home
through
the
darkness
beaten
at
last
mad
with
shame
and
anger
and
foreboding
the
first
thing
he
saw
on
entering
the
kitchen
was
his
son
sitting
muffled
in
his
coat
by
the
great
fender
footnotes
a
bullock
to
bound
chapter
xxv
janet
and
her
mother
saw
a
quiver
run
through
gourlay
as
he
stood
and
glowered
from
the
threshold
he
seemed
of
monstrous
bulk
and
significance
filling
the
doorway
in
his
silence
the
quiver
that
went
through
him
was
a
sign
of
his
contending
angers
his
will
struggling
with
the
tumult
of
wrath
that
threatened
to
spoil
his
revenge
to
fell
that
huddled
oaf
with
a
blow
would
be
a
poor
return
for
all
he
had
endured
because
of
him
he
meant
to
sweat
punishment
out
of
him
drop
by
drop
with
slow
and
vicious
enjoyment
but
the
sudden
sight
of
that
living
disgrace
to
the
gourlays
woke
a
wild
desire
to
leap
on
him
at
once
and
glut
his
rage
a
madness
which
only
a
will
like
his
could
control
he
quivered
with
the
effort
to
keep
it
in
to
bring
a
beaten
and
degraded
look
into
a
man
face
rend
manhood
out
of
him
in
fear
is
a
sight
that
makes
decent
men
wince
in
pain
for
it
is
an
outrage
on
the
decency
of
life
an
offence
to
natural
religion
a
violation
of
the
human
sanctities
yet
gourlay
had
done
it
once
and
again
i
saw
him
down
a
man
at
the
cross
once
a
big
man
with
a
viking
beard
dark
brown
from
which
you
would
have
looked
for
manliness
gourlay
with
stabbing
eyes
threatened
and
birred
and
downed
him
till
he
crept
away
with
a
face
like
chalk
and
a
hunted
furtive
eye
curiously
it
was
his
manly
beard
that
made
the
look
such
a
pain
for
its
contrasting
colour
showed
the
white
face
of
the
coward
and
a
coward
had
no
right
to
such
a
beard
a
grim
and
cruel
smile
went
after
him
as
he
slunk
away
barked
gourlay
in
lordly
and
pursuing
scorn
and
the
fellow
leapt
where
he
walked
as
the
cry
went
through
him
to
break
a
man
spirit
so
take
that
from
him
which
he
will
never
recover
while
he
lives
send
him
slinking
away
for
that
is
what
it
comes
to
is
a
sinister
outrage
of
the
world
it
is
as
bad
as
the
rape
of
a
woman
and
ranks
with
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
derives
from
it
indeed
yet
it
was
this
outrage
that
gourlay
meant
to
work
upon
his
son
he
would
work
him
down
and
down
this
son
of
his
till
he
was
less
than
a
man
a
frightened
furtive
animal
then
perhaps
he
would
give
a
loose
to
his
other
rage
unbuckle
his
belt
and
thrash
the
grown
man
like
a
wriggling
urchin
on
the
floor
as
he
stood
glowering
from
the
door
gourlay
rose
with
an
appealing
cry
of
but
gourlay
put
his
eye
on
her
and
she
sank
into
her
chair
staring
up
at
him
in
terror
the
strings
of
the
tawdry
cap
she
wore
seemed
to
choke
her
and
she
unfastened
them
with
nervous
fingers
fumbling
long
beneath
her
lifted
chin
to
get
them
loose
she
did
not
remove
the
cap
but
let
the
strings
dangle
by
her
jaw
the
silly
bits
of
cloth
waggling
and
quivering
as
she
turned
her
head
repeatedly
from
son
to
husband
and
from
husband
to
son
added
to
her
air
of
helplessness
and
inefficiency
once
she
whispered
with
ghastly
intensity
have
mercy
for
a
length
of
time
there
was
a
loaded
silence
gourlay
went
up
to
the
hearth
and
looked
down
on
his
son
from
near
at
hand
john
shrank
down
in
his
greatcoat
a
reek
of
alcohol
rose
from
around
him
janet
whimpered
but
when
gourlay
spoke
it
was
with
deadly
quietude
the
moan
was
in
his
voice
so
great
was
his
controlled
wrath
that
he
drew
in
great
shivering
breastfuls
of
air
between
the
words
as
if
for
strength
to
utter
them
and
they
quavered
forth
on
it
again
he
seemed
weakened
by
his
own
rage
ay
man
he
breathed
ye
won
hame
i
observe
me
the
contrast
between
the
lowness
of
his
voice
and
his
steady
breathing
anger
that
possessed
the
air
they
felt
it
coming
as
on
waves
was
demoniac
appalling
john
could
not
speak
he
was
paralyzed
by
fear
to
have
this
vast
hostile
force
touch
him
yet
be
still
struck
him
dumb
why
did
his
father
not
break
out
on
him
at
once
what
did
he
mean
what
was
he
going
to
do
the
jamb
of
the
fireplace
cut
his
right
shoulder
as
he
cowered
into
it
to
get
away
as
far
as
he
could
i
saying
ye
won
hame
quivered
gourlay
in
a
deadly
slowness
and
his
eyes
never
left
his
son
and
still
the
son
made
no
reply
in
the
silence
the
ticking
of
the
big
clock
seemed
to
fill
their
world
they
were
conscious
of
nothing
else
it
smote
the
ear
ay
john
gulped
at
last
from
a
throat
that
felt
closing
the
answer
seemed
dragged
out
of
him
by
the
insistent
silence
just
breathed
his
father
and
his
eyes
opened
in
wide
flame
he
heaved
with
the
great
breath
he
drew
he
drawled
he
went
through
to
the
scullery
at
the
back
of
the
kitchen
to
wash
his
hands
through
the
open
door
janet
and
her
mother
looking
at
each
other
with
affrighted
eyes
could
hear
him
sneering
at
intervals
ay
man
just
that
now
and
again
ay
ay
me
in
grim
falsetto
irony
when
he
came
back
to
the
kitchen
he
turned
to
janet
and
left
his
son
in
a
suspended
agony
ay
woman
jenny
ye
there
he
said
and
nipped
her
ear
as
he
passed
over
to
his
chair
were
ye
in
skeighan
the
day
ay
faither
she
answered
and
what
did
the
skeighan
doctor
say
she
raised
her
large
pale
eyes
to
his
with
a
strange
look
then
her
head
sank
low
on
her
breast
nothing
she
said
at
last
nothing
said
he
nothing
for
nothing
then
i
hope
you
didna
pay
him
no
faither
she
answered
i
hadna
the
bawbees
when
did
ye
get
back
he
asked
just
after
just
after
her
eyes
flickered
over
to
john
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
mentioning
his
name
oh
just
after
this
gentleman
but
there
noathing
strange
in
you
were
always
after
him
you
were
born
after
him
and
considered
after
him
he
aye
had
the
best
i
howp
are
in
good
health
he
sneered
turning
to
his
son
it
would
never
do
for
a
man
to
break
down
at
the
outset
o
a
great
career
for
ye
at
the
outset
o
a
great
career
are
ye
na
his
speech
was
as
soft
as
the
foot
of
a
tiger
and
sheathed
as
rending
a
cruelty
there
was
no
escaping
the
crouching
stealth
of
it
if
he
had
leapt
with
a
roar
john
drunken
fury
might
have
lashed
itself
to
rage
but
the
younger
and
weaker
man
was
fascinated
and
helpless
before
the
creeping
approach
of
so
monstrous
a
wrath
eh
asked
gourlay
softly
when
john
made
no
reply
i
saying
at
the
outset
o
a
great
career
are
ye
no
eh
soft
as
his
eh
was
in
utterance
it
was
insinuating
pursuing
it
had
to
be
answered
no
whimpered
john
well
well
you
maybe
at
the
end
have
ye
been
studying
hard
yes
lied
john
that
right
cried
his
father
with
great
heartiness
there
my
brave
fellow
noathing
like
studying
and
no
doubt
he
leaned
over
suavely
and
no
doubt
ye
brought
a
wheen
prizes
home
wi
ye
as
usual
eh
there
was
no
answer
eh
no
gulped
the
cowerer
prizes
cried
gourlay
and
his
eyebrows
went
up
in
a
pretended
surprise
prizes
ay
man
fow
that
na
young
gourlay
was
being
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
beaten
child
who
when
his
mother
asks
if
he
has
been
a
bad
boy
is
made
to
sob
yes
at
her
knee
have
you
been
a
good
boy
she
asks
no
he
pants
and
are
you
sorry
for
being
a
bad
boy
yes
he
sobs
and
will
you
be
a
good
boy
now
then
yes
he
almost
shrieks
in
his
desire
to
be
at
one
with
his
mother
young
gourlay
was
being
equally
beaten
from
his
own
nature
equally
battered
under
by
another
personality
only
he
was
not
asked
to
be
a
good
boy
he
might
gang
to
hell
for
anything
auld
gourlay
cared
when
once
he
had
bye
with
him
even
as
he
degraded
his
son
to
this
state
of
unnatural
cowardice
gourlay
felt
a
vast
disgust
swell
within
him
that
a
son
of
his
should
be
such
a
coward
damn
him
he
thought
glowering
with
contempt
at
the
huddled
creature
he
hasna
the
pluck
o
a
pig
how
can
he
stand
talk
like
this
without
showing
he
a
man
when
i
was
a
child
on
the
brisket
if
a
man
had
used
me
as
i
using
him
i
would
have
flung
mysell
at
him
he
a
object
to
carry
the
name
o
john
gourla
my
god
what
a
of
life
i
made
that
auld
trollop
for
my
wife
that
sumph
for
my
son
and
that
dying
lassie
for
my
dochter
was
it
i
that
bred
him
he
leapt
to
his
feet
in
devilish
merriment
set
out
the
spirits
jenny
he
cried
set
out
the
spirits
my
son
and
i
must
have
a
drink
together
to
celebrate
the
occeesion
ou
ay
he
sneered
drawling
out
the
word
with
sharp
unfamiliar
sound
just
to
celebrate
the
occeesion
the
wild
humour
that
seized
him
was
inevitable
born
of
a
vicious
effort
to
control
a
rage
that
was
constantly
increasing
fed
by
the
sight
of
the
offender
every
time
he
glanced
across
at
the
thing
sitting
there
he
was
swept
with
fresh
surges
of
fury
and
disgust
but
his
vicious
constraint
curbed
them
under
and
refused
them
a
natural
expression
they
sought
an
unnatural
some
vent
they
must
have
and
they
found
it
in
a
score
of
wild
devilries
he
began
to
practise
on
his
son
wrath
fed
and
checked
in
one
brings
the
hell
on
which
man
is
built
to
the
surface
gourlay
was
transformed
he
had
a
fluency
of
speech
a
power
of
banter
a
readiness
of
tongue
which
he
had
never
shown
before
he
was
beyond
himself
have
you
heard
the
snarl
with
which
a
wild
beast
arrests
the
escaping
prey
which
it
has
just
let
go
in
enjoying
cruelty
gourlay
was
that
animal
for
a
moment
he
would
cease
to
torture
his
son
feed
his
disgust
with
a
glower
then
the
sight
of
him
huddled
there
would
wake
a
desire
to
stamp
on
him
but
his
will
would
not
allow
that
for
it
would
spoil
the
sport
he
had
set
his
mind
on
and
so
he
played
with
the
victim
which
he
would
not
kill
set
out
the
speerits
jenny
he
birred
when
she
wavered
in
fear
what
are
ye
shaking
for
set
out
the
speerits
just
to
shelebrate
the
joyful
occeesion
ye
know
ay
ay
just
to
shelebrate
the
joyful
occeesion
janet
brought
a
tray
with
glasses
from
the
pantry
as
she
walked
the
rims
of
the
glasses
shivered
and
tinkled
against
each
other
from
her
trembling
then
she
set
a
bottle
on
the
table
gourlay
sent
it
crashing
to
the
floor
a
bottle
he
roared
a

at

a

fellow

it
was
a
big
scotch
containing
more
than
half
a
gill
of
whisky
and
john
drained
it
to
the
bottom
to
him
it
had
been
a
deadly
thing
at
first
coming
thus
from
his
father
hand
he
had
taken
it
into
his
own
with
a
feeling
of
aversion
that
was
strangely
blended
of
disgust
and
fear
but
the
moment
it
touched
his
lips
desire
leapt
in
his
throat
to
get
at
it
good
roared
his
father
in
mock
admiration
god
ye
have
the
thrapple
when
i
was
your
age
that
would
have
choked
me
i
must
have
a
look
at
that
throat
o
yours
stand
up
up
when
i
tall
john
rose
swaying
to
his
feet
months
of
constant
tippling
culminating
in
a
wild
debauch
had
shattered
him
he
stood
in
a
reeling
world
and
the
fear
weakening
his
limbs
changed
his
drunken
stupor
to
a
sickness
he
swayed
to
and
fro
with
a
cold
sweat
oozing
from
his
chalky
face
what
ado
wi
the
fellow
cried
gourlay
oom
he
swinging
like
a
i
must
round
this
and
have
a
look
john
drunken
submissiveness
encouraged
his
father
to
new
devilries
the
ease
with
which
he
tortured
him
provoked
him
to
more
torture
he
went
on
more
and
more
viciously
as
if
he
were
conducting
an
experiment
to
see
how
much
the
creature
would
bear
before
he
turned
gourlay
was
enjoying
the
glutting
of
his
own
wrath
he
turned
his
son
round
with
a
finger
and
thumb
on
his
shoulder
in
insolent
inspection
as
you
turn
an
urchin
round
to
see
him
in
his
new
suit
of
clothes
then
he
crouched
before
him
his
face
thrust
close
to
the
other
and
peered
into
his
eyes
his
mouth
distent
with
an
infernal
smile
my
boy
johnny
he
said
sweetly
my
boy
johnny
and
patted
him
gently
on
the
cheek
john
raised
dull
eyes
and
looked
into
his
father
far
within
him
a
great
wrath
was
gathering
through
his
fear
another
voice
another
self
seemed
to
whimper
with
dull
iteration
i
him
i
him
by
god
i
him
if
he
doesna
stop
this
if
he
keeps
on
like
this
at
me
but
his
present
and
material
self
was
paralyzed
with
fear
open
your
mouth
came
the
snarl

said
gourlay
with
a
critical
drawl
pulling
john

about

him
the

the
latin

auld

consolation
the
brandy
bottle
slipped
from
the
quivering
fingers
and
was
smashed
to
pieces
on
the
floor
hurrah
yelled
gourlay
he
seemed
rapt
and
carried
by
his
own
devilry
the
wreck
and
ruin
strewn
about
the
floor
consorted
with
the
ruin
of
his
fortunes
let
all
go
smash
what
was
the
use
of
caring
now
in
his
frenzy
he
ordinarily
so
careful
seemed
to
delight
in
the
smashings
and
the
breakings
they
suited
his
despair
he
saw
that
his
spirit
of
destruction
frightened
them
too
and
that
was
another
reason
to
indulge
it
to
hell
with
everything
he
yelled
like
a
the
hearty
fellows
we
make
a
red
night
now
we
at
it
and
with
that
he
took
the
heel
of
a
bottle
on
his
toe
and
sent
it
flying
among
the
dishes
on
the
dresser
a
great
plate
fell
split
in
two
poor
fellow
he
whined
turning
to
his
son
fellow
i
fear
he
has
lost
his
pheesic
for
that
was
the
last
bottle
o
brandy
in

last
he
ever
buy
what
am
i
to
do
wi
ye
now
eh
i
must
do
something
it
coming
to
the
bit
now
sir
as
he
stood
in
a
heaving
silence
the
sobbing
of
the
two
women
was
heard
through
the
room
john
was
still
swaying
on
the
floor
sometimes
gourlay
would
run
the
full
length
of
the
kitchen
and
stand
there
glowering
on
a
stoop
then
he
would
come
crouching
up
to
his
son
on
a
vicious
little
trot
pattering
in
rage
the
broken
glass
crunching
and
grinding
beneath
his
feet
at
any
moment
he
might
spring
what
do
ye
think
i
mean
to
do
wi
ye
now
he
moaned
eh
what
do
ye
think
i
mean
to
do
wi
ye
now
as
he
came
grinning
in
rage
his
lips
ran
out
to
their
full
width
and
the
tense
slit
showed
his
teeth
to
their
roots
the
gums
were
white
the
stricture
of
the
lips
had
squeezed
them
bloodless
he
went
back
to
the
dresser
once
more
and
bent
low
beside
it
glancing
at
his
son
across
his
left
shoulder
with
his
head
flung
back
sideways
his
right
fist
clenched
low
and
ready
from
a
curve
of
the
elbow
it
swung
heavy
as
a
mallet
by
his
thigh
janet
got
to
her
knees
and
came
shuffling
across
the
floor
on
them
though
her
dress
was
tripping
her
clasping
her
outstretched
hands
and
sobbing
in
appeal
faither
faither
o
faither
for
god
sake
faither
she
clung
to
him
he
unclenched
his
fist
and
lifted
her
away
then
he
came
crouching
and
quivering
across
the
floor
slowly
a
gleaming
devilry
in
the
eyes
that
devoured
his
son
his
hands
were
like
outstretched
claws
and
shivered
with
each
shiver
of
the
voice
that
moaned
through
set
teeth
what
do
ye
think
i
mean
to
do
wi
ye
now
what
do
ye
think
i
mean
to
do
ye
now
ye
damned
sorrow
and
disgrace
that
ye
are
what
do
ye
think
i
mean
to
do
wi
ye
now
run
john
screamed
gourlay
leaping
to
her
feet
with
a
hunted
cry
young
gourlay
sprang
to
the
door
so
great
had
been
the
fixity
of
gourlay
wrath
so
tense
had
he
been
in
one
direction
as
he
moved
slowly
on
his
prey
that
he
could
not
leap
to
prevent
him
as
john
plunged
into
the
cool
soft
darkness
his
mother
thank
god
rang
past
him
on
the
night
his
immediate
feeling
was
of
coolness
and
width
and
spaciousness
in
contrast
with
the
hot
grinding
hostility
that
had
bored
so
closely
in
on
him
for
the
last
hour
he
felt
the
benignness
of
the
darkened
heavens
a
tag
of
some
forgotten
poem
he
had
read
came
back
to
his
mind
and
come
kindly
night
and
cover
me
he
muttered
with
shaking
lips
and
felt
how
true
it
was
my
god
what
a
relief
to
be
free
of
his
eyes
they
had
held
him
till
his
mother
voice
broke
the
spell
they
seemed
to
burn
him
now
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
face
his
father
when
empty
both
of
food
and
drink
every
man
was
when
he
was
empty
if
his
mother
had
had
time
to
get
the
tea
it
would
have
been
different
but
the
fire
had
been
out
when
he
went
in
he
would
have
downed
me
so
easy
if
i
had
had
anything
in
me
he
muttered
and
his
anger
grew
as
he
thought
of
all
he
had
been
made
to
suffer
for
he
was
still
the
swaggerer
now
that
the
incubus
of
his
father
tyranny
no
longer
pressed
on
him
directly
a
great
hate
rose
within
him
for
the
tyrant
he
would
go
back
and
have
it
out
when
he
was
primed
it
the
only
hame
i
have
he
sobbed
angrily
to
the
darkness
i
have
no
other
place
to
gang
till
yes
i
go
back
and
have
it
out
with
him
when
once
i
get
something
in
me
so
i
will
it
was
no
disgrace
to
suck
courage
from
the
bottle
for
that
encounter
with
his
father
for
nobody
could
stand
up
to
black
gourlay
nobody
young
gourlay
was
yielding
to
a
peculiar
fatalism
of
minds
diseased
all
that
affects
them
seems
different
from
all
that
affects
everybody
else
they
are
even
proud
of
their
separate
and
peculiar
doom
young
gourlay
not
thought
but
felt
it
he
was
different
from
everybody
else
the
heavens
had
cursed
nobody
else
with
such
a
terrible
sire
it
was
no
cowardice
to
fill
yourself
with
drink
before
you
faced
him
a
drunkard
will
howl
you
an
obscene
chorus
the
moment
after
he
has
wept
about
his
dead
child
for
a
mind
in
the
delirium
of
drink
is
no
longer
a
coherent
whole
but
a
heap
of
shattered
bits
which
it
shows
one
after
the
other
to
the
world
hence
the
many
transformations
of
that
and
their
quick
variety
young
gourlay
was
showing
them
now
his
had
always
been
a
wandering
mind
deficient
in
application
and
control
and
as
he
neared
his
final
collapse
it
became
more
and
more
variable
the
prey
of
each
momentary
thought
in
a
short
five
minutes
of
time
he
had
been
alive
to
the
beauty
of
the
darkness
cowering
before
the
memory
of
his
father
eyes
sobbing
in
and
angry
resolve
shaking
in
terror
indeed
he
was
shaking
now
but
his
vanity
came
uppermost
as
he
neared
the
red
lion
he
stopped
suddenly
and
the
darkness
seemed
on
fire
against
his
cheeks
he
would
have
to
face
curious
eyes
he
reflected
it
was
from
the
red
lion
he
and
aird
had
started
so
grandly
in
the
autumn
it
would
never
do
to
come
slinking
back
like
a
whipped
cur
he
must
carry
it
off
bravely
in
case
the
usual
busybodies
should
be
gathered
round
the
bar
so
with
his
coat
flapping
lordly
on
either
side
of
him
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
drove
at
the
with
an
outshot
chest
and
entered
with
a
breenge
but
for
all
his
swagger
he
must
have
had
a
face
like
death
for
there
was
a
cry
among
the
idlers
a
man
breathed
my
god
what
the
matter
with
shaking
knees
gourlay
advanced
to
the
bar
and
for
god
sake
aggie
he
whispered
give
me
a
kinblythmont
it
went
at
a
gulp
another
he
gasped
like
a
man
dying
of
thirst
whom
his
first
sip
maddens
for
more
another
another
he
had
tossed
the
other
down
his
burning
throat
when
deacon
allardyce
came
in
he
knew
his
man
the
moment
he
set
eyes
on
him
but
standing
at
the
door
he
arched
his
hand
above
his
brow
as
you
do
in
gazing
at
a
dear
unexpected
friend
whom
you
pretend
not
to
be
quite
sure
of
so
surprised
and
pleased
are
you
to
see
him
there
ith
it
dyohn
he
cried
it
dyohn
and
he
toddled
forward
with
outstretched
hand
man
dyohn
he
said
again
as
if
he
could
scarce
believe
the
good
news
and
he
waggled
the
other
hand
up
and
down
with
both
his
own
clasped
over
it
i
proud
to
thee
you
thir
i
am
that
and
tho
you
won
hame
ay
and
how
are
ye
tummin
on
oh
all
right
deacon
said
gourlay
with
a
silly
laugh
have
a
wet
the
whisky
had
begun
to
warm
him
a
said
the
deacon
blinking
in
a
puzzled
fashion
with
his
bleary
old
eyes
a
dram
a
drink
a
drop
o
the
auld
kirk
said
gourlay
with
a
stertorous
laugh
down
through
his
nostrils
hi
hi
laughed
the
deacon
in
his
best
falsetto
ith
that
what
ye
call
it
up
in
embro
a
wet
ay
ah
well
maybe
i
will
take
a
little
drope
theeing
you
tho
ready
wi
your
offer
they
drank
together
aggie
fill
me
a
mutchkin
when
you
at
it
said
gourlay
to
the
pretty
barmaid
with
the
curly
hair
he
had
spent
many
an
hour
with
her
last
summer
in
the
bar
the
four
big
whiskies
he
had
swallowed
in
the
last
were
singing
in
him
now
and
he
blinked
at
her
drunkenly
there
was
a
scarlet
ribbon
on
her
dark
curls
coquettish
vivid
and
gourlay
stared
at
it
dreamily
partly
in
a
drunken
daze
and
partly
because
a
striking
colour
always
brought
a
musing
and
look
within
his
eyes
all
his
life
he
used
to
stare
at
things
dreamily
and
come
to
himself
with
a
start
when
spoken
to
he
forgot
himself
now
aggie
he
said
and
put
his
hand
out
to
hers
clumsily
where
it
rested
on
the
counter
aggie
that
ribbon
infernal
bonny
on
your
dark

none

there
were
half
a
dozen
in
the
place
by
this
time
and
they
all
stared
with
greedy
eyes
that
young
gourlay
him
that
was
was
heard
the
last
an
emphatic
whisper
with
round
eyes
of
awe
at
the
offence

have
merited

punishment

john

with
a
very
considering

and

in

uplifted

properly
speaking

the
entrance
of
brodie
spoiled
sport
for
the
deacon
he
had
nothing
of
that
malicious
that
made
allardyce
a
genius
at
nicking
men
on
the
raw
he
went
straight
to
his
work
stabbing
like
an
awl
he
cried
pausing
with
contempt
in
the
middle
of
the
word
when
he
saw
young
gourlay
here
brig
o

if

up
in

i

up
till

gey

and
he
winked
openly
to
those
around
young
gourlay
maddened
nature
broke
at
the
insult
damn
you
he
screamed
leave
alone
will
you
i
have
done
nothing

i
brodie
stared
at
him
across
his
suspended
whisky
glass
an
easy
and
assured
contempt
curling
his
lip
do
greet
my
bairn
said
he
and
even
as
he
spoke
john
glass
shivered
on
his
grinning
teeth
brodie
leapt
on
him
lifted
him
and
sent
him
flying
that
a
game
of
your
father
you
damned
dog
he
roared
but
there
mair
than
him
can
play
the
game
canny
my
freendth
canny
piped
allardyce
who
was
vexed
at
a
fine
chance
for
his
peculiar
craft
being
spoiled
by
mere
brutality
of
handling
all
this
was
most
inartistic
brodie
never
had
the
fine
stroke
gourlay
picked
himself
bleeding
from
the
floor
and
holding
a
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
plunged
headlong
from
the
room
he
heard
the
derisive
roar
that
came
after
him
stop
strangled
by
the
sharp
of
the
door
but
it
seemed
to
echo
in
his
burning
ears
as
he
strode
madly
on
through
the
darkness
he
uncorked
his
mutchkin
and
drank
it
like
water
his
swollen
lip
smarted
at
first
but
he
drank
till
it
was
a
mere
dead
lump
to
his
tongue
and
he
could
not
feel
the
whisky
on
the
wound
his
mind
at
first
was
a
burning
whirl
through
drink
and
rage
with
nothing
determined
and
nothing
definite
but
thought
began
to
shape
itself
in
a
vast
vague
circle
of
consciousness
his
mind
seemed
to
sit
in
the
centre
and
think
with
preternatural
clearness
though
all
around
was
whirling
and
confused
drink
had
endowed
some
inner
eye
of
the
brain
with
unnatural
swift
vividness
far
within
the
humming
circle
of
his
mind
he
saw
an
instant
and
terrible
revenge
on
brodie
acted
it
and
lived
it
now
his
desires
were
murderers
and
he
let
them
slip
gloating
in
the
cruelties
that
hot
fancy
wreaked
upon
his
enemy
then
he
suddenly
remembered
his
father
a
rush
of
fiery
blood
seemed
to
drench
all
his
body
as
he
thought
of
what
had
passed
between
them
but
by
heaven
he
swore
as
he
threw
away
his
empty
bottle
he
wo
use
me
like
that
another
time
i
have
blood
in
me
now
his
maddened
fancy
began
building
a
new
scene
with
the
same
actors
the
same
conditions
as
the
other
but
an
issue
gloriously
diverse
with
vicious
delight
he
heard
his
father
use
the
same
sneers
the
same
gibes
the
same
brutalities
then
he
turned
suddenly
and
had
him
under
foot
kicking
bludgeoning
stamping
the
life
out
he
would
do
it
by
heaven
he
would
do
it
the
memory
of
what
had
happened
came
fierily
back
and
made
the
pressing
darkness
burn
his
wrath
was
brimming
on
the
edge
ready
to
burst
and
he
felt
proudly
that
it
would
no
longer
ebb
in
fear
whisky
had
killed
fear
and
left
a
hysterical
madman
all
the
more
dangerous
because
he
was
so
weak
let
his
father
try
it
on
now
he
was
ready
for
him
and
his
father
was
ready
for
him
for
he
knew
what
had
happened
at
the
inn
webster
on
her
nightly
hunt
for
the
man
she
had
sworn
to
honour
and
obey
having
drawn
several
blank
ran
him
to
earth
at
last
in
the
of
the
red
lion
yes
yes
kirsty
he
cried
eager
to
prevent
her
tongue
i
know
i
a
blagyird
but
oh
the
terrible
thing
that
has
happened
he
so
possessed
her
with
his
graphic
tale
that
he
was
allowed
to
go
chuckling
back
to
his
potations
while
she
ran
to
the
green
shutters
eh
gourlay
and
oh
your
boy
too
and
eh
that
brute
tam
brodie
even
as
she
came
through
the
door
the
voluble
clatter
was
shrilling
out
the
big
tidings
before
she
was
aware
of
gourlay
presence
she
faltered
beneath
his
black
glower
go
on
he
said
and
ground
it
out
of
her
the
damned
sumph
he
growled
to
let
brodie
hammer
him
for
a
moment
it
is
true
his
anger
was
divided
stood
in
equipoise
even
dipped
i
an
account
to
sattle
wi
he
thought
grimly
when
get
my
claw
on
his
neck
i
teach
him
better
than
to
hit
a
gourlay
i
wonder
he
mused
with
a
pride
in
which
was
neither
doubt
nor
wonder
i
wonder
will
he
fling
the
father
as
he
flang
the
son
but
that
was
the
instinct
of
his
blood
not
enough
to
make
him
pardon
john
on
the
contrary
here
was
a
new
offence
of
his
offspring
on
the
morrow
barbie
would
be
burning
with
another
affront
which
he
had
put
upon
the
name
of
gourlay
he
would
waste
no
time
when
he
came
back
be
he
drunk
or
be
he
sober
he
would
strip
the
flesh
off
him
jenny
he
said
bring
me
the
he
would
pass
the
time
till
the
prodigal
came
back
and
he
was
almost
certain
to
come
back
for
where
could
he
go
in
barbie
he
would
pass
the
time
by
trying
to
improve
the
appearance
of
the
house
he
had
spent
money
on
his
house
till
the
last
and
even
now
had
the
instinct
to
embellish
it
not
that
it
mattered
to
him
now
still
he
could
carry
out
a
small
improvement
he
had
planned
before
the
kitchen
was
ceiled
in
dark
timber
and
on
the
rich
brown
rafters
there
were
wooden
pegs
and
bars
for
the
hanging
of
gourlay
sticks
and
his
gun
was
up
there
too
just
above
the
hearth
it
had
occurred
to
him
about
a
month
ago
however
that
a
pair
of
curving
steel
rests
that
would
catch
the
glint
from
the
fire
would
look
better
beneath
his
gun
than
the
dull
pegs
where
it
now
lay
against
a
joist
he
might
as
well
pass
the
time
by
putting
them
up
the
bringing
of
the
steps
light
though
they
were
was
too
much
for
janet
weak
frame
and
she
stopped
in
a
fit
of
coughing
clutching
the
ladder
for
support
while
it
shook
to
her
spasms
tuts
jenny
this
never
do
said
gourlay
not
unkindly
he
took
the
ladder
away
from
her
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
away
to
your
bed
lass
you
maunna
sit
so
late
but
janet
was
anxious
for
her
brother
and
wanted
to
sit
up
till
he
came
home
she
answered
yes
to
her
father
but
idled
discreetly
to
consume
the
time
where
my
hammer
snarled
gourlay
is
it
no
by
the
clock
said
his
wife
wearily
oh
i
remember
i
remember
i
gied
it
to
webster
to
break
some
to
rub
the
front
doorstep
wi
it
be
lying
in
the
porch
oh
ay
as
usual
said
gourlay
as
usual
john
she
cried
in
alarm
you
do
mean
to
take
down
the
gun
do
ye
huts
you
auld
fule
what
are
you
skirling
for
d

i
mean
to
shoot
the
dog
set
back
on
your
creepie
and
make
less
noise
will
ye
ere
he
had
driven
a
nail
in
the
rafter
john
came
in
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
taking
up
the
great
poker
as
if
to
cover
his
nervousness
if
gourlay
had
been
on
the
floor
he
would
have
grappled
with
him
there
and
then
but
the
temptation
to
gloat
over
his
victim
from
his
present
height
was
irresistible
he
went
up
another
step
and
sat
down
on
the
very
summit
of
the
ladder
his
feet
resting
on
one
of
the
lower
rounds
the
hammer
he
had
been
using
was
lying
on
his
thigh
his
hand
clutched
about
its
haft
ay
man
you
been
taking
a
bit
walk
i
hear
john
made
no
reply
but
played
with
the
poker
it
was
so
huge
owing
to
gourlay
whim
that
when
it
slid
through
his
fingers
it
came
down
on
the
muffled
hearthstone
with
a
thud
like
a
pavior
hammer
i
told
you
saw
the
deacon
on
your
rounds
did
he
compliment
you
on
your
return
at
the
quiet
sneer
a
showed
john
that
allardyce
had
quizzed
him
too
for
a
moment
he
was
conscious
of
a
vast
damn
them
they
all
down
on
me
he
thought
then
a
vindictive
rage
against
them
all
took
hold
of
him
tense
quivering
did
you
see
thomas
brodie
when
ye
were
out
came
the
suave
inquiry
i
saw
him
said
john
raising
fierce
eyes
to
his
father
he
was
proud
of
the
sudden
firmness
in
his
voice
there
was
no
fear
in
it
no
quivering
he
was
beyond
caring
what
happened
to
the
world
or
him
oh
you
saw
him
roared
gourlay
as
his
anger
leapt
to
meet
the
anger
of
his
son
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
may
i
speir
or
maybe
i
should
speir
what
he
did
eh
he
grinned
by
god
i
kill
ye
screamed
john
springing
to
his
feet
with
the
poker
in
his
hand
the
hammer
went
whizzing
past
his
ear
gourlay
screamed
and
tried
to
rise
from
her
chair
her
eyes
goggling
in
terror
as
gourlay
leapt
john
brought
the
huge
poker
with
a
crash
on
the
descending
brow
the
fiercest
joy
of
his
life
was
the
dirl
that
went
up
his
arm
as
the
steel
thrilled
to
its
own
hard
impact
on
the
bone
gourlay
thudded
on
the
fender
his
brow
crashing
on
the
rim
at
the
blow
there
had
been
a
cry
as
of
animals
from
the
two
women
there
followed
an
eternity
of
silence
it
seemed
and
a
haze
about
the
place
yet
not
a
haze
for
everything
was
intensely
clear
only
it
belonged
to
another
world
one
terrible
fact
had
changed
the
universe
the
air
was
different
now
it
was
full
of
murder
everything
in
the
room
had
a
new
significance
a
sinister
meaning
the
effect
was
that
of
an
unholy
spell
as
through
a
dream
gourlay
voice
was
heard
crying
on
her
god
john
stood
there
suddenly
weak
in
his
limbs
and
stared
as
if
petrified
at
the
red
poker
in
his
hand
a
little
wisp
of
grizzled
hair
stuck
to
the
square
of
it
severed
as
by
scissors
between
the
sharp
edge
and
the
bone
it
was
the
sight
of
that
bit
of
hair
that
roused
him
from
his
stupor
it
seemed
so
monstrous
and
horrible
sticking
all
by
itself
to
the
poker
i
didna
strike
him
so
hard
he
pleaded
staring
vaguely
i
didna
strike
him
so
hard
now
that
the
frenzy
had
left
him
he
failed
to
realize
the
force
of
his
own
blow
then
with
a
horrid
fear
on
him
get
up
faither
he
entreated
get
up
faither
o
man
you
micht
get
up
janet
who
had
bent
above
the
fallen
man
raised
an
ashen
face
to
her
brother
and
whispered
hoarsely
his
heart
has
stopped
john
you
have
killed
him
steps
were
heard
coming
through
the
scullery
in
the
fear
of
discovery
gourlay
shook
off
the
apathy
that
held
her
paralyzed
she
sprang
up
snatched
the
poker
from
her
son
and
thrust
it
in
the
embers
run
john
run
for
the
doctor
she
o

webster
i
glad
to
see

fell
from

top
o

and
smashed
his
brow
on
the
muckle
fender
chapter
xxvi
mother
came
the
startled
whisper
mother
o
woman
waken
and
speak
to
me
no
comforting
answer
came
from
the
darkness
to
tell
of
a
human
being
close
at
hand
the
girl
intently
listening
was
alone
with
her
fear
all
was
silent
in
the
room
and
the
terror
deepened
then
the
sound
in
the
house
was
heard
once
more
mother
mother
what
that
what
is
it
janet
came
a
feebly
complaining
voice
what
wrong
ye
lassie
janet
and
her

were
sleeping
in
the
big
bedroom
janet
in
the
place
that
had
been
her
father
he
had
been
buried
through
the
day
the
second
day
after
his
murder
gourlay
had
shown
a
feverish
anxiety
to
get
the
corpse
out
the
house
as
soon
as
possible
and
there
had
been
nothing
to
prevent
it
oh
said
doctor
dandy
to
the
gossips
it
would
have
killed
any
man
to
fall
from
such
a
height
on
to
the
sharp
edge
of
yon
fender
no
he
was
not
quite
dead
when
i
got
to
him
he
opened
his
eyes
on
me
once
a
terrible
look
and
then
life
went
out
of
him
with
a
great
quiver
ere
janet
could
answer
her
mother
she
was
seized
with
a
racking
cough
and
her
hoarse
bark
sounded
hollow
in
the
silence
at
last
she
sat
up
and
gasped
fearfully
i
thocht
i
thocht
i
heard
something
moving

won

janet
the
stair
creaked
the
two
women
clung
to
each
other
gripping
tight
fingers
and
their
hearts
throbbed
like
big
separate
beings
in
their
breasts
there
was
a
rustle
as
of
something
coming
then
the
door
opened
and
john
flitted
to
the
bedside
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
above
his
nightshirt
his
bloodless
face
looked
gray

panted

he
sang
the
words
in
a
hysterical
chant
his
voice
rising
at
the
end
the
door
of
the
bedroom
clicked
it
was
not
a
slamming
sound
only
the
door
went
to
gently
as
if
some
one
closed
it
john
dropped
the
candle
from
his
shaking
hand
and
was
left
standing
in
the
living
darkness
me
he
screamed
and
leaped
into
the
bed
burrowing
down
between
the
women
till
his
head
was
covered
by
the
bedclothes
he
trembled
so
violently
that
the
bed
shook
beneath
them

pleaded
with
chattering
jaws
oh

she
placed
her
hand
on
his
brow
caressingly
his
hair
was
damp
with
a
cold
sweat
he
reeked
of
alcohol
some
one
went
through
the
square
playing
a
concertina
that
sound
of
the
careless
world
came
strangely
in
upon
their
lonely
tragedy
by
contrast
the
cheerful
silly
noise
out
there
seemed
to
intensify
their
darkness
and
isolation
here
occasional
shouts
were
heard
from
roisterers
going
home
gourlay
lay
staring
at
the
darkness
with
intent
eyes
what
horror
might
assail
her
she
did
not
know
but
she
was
ready
to
meet
it
for
the
sake
of
john
ye
brought
it
on
yoursell
she
breathed
once
as
if
defying
an
unseen
accuser
it
was
hours
ere
he
slept
but
at
last
a
heavy
sough
told
her
he
had
found
oblivion
he
won
owre
she
murmured
thankfully
at
times
he
muttered
in
his
sleep
and
at
times
janet
coughed
hoarsely
at
his
ear
janet
dinna
hoast
sae
loud
woman
you
waken
your
brother
janet
was
silent
then
she
choked
trying
to
stifle
another
cough
woman
said
her
mother
complainingly
that

unco
hoast

janet
it
a

next
morning
postie
came
clattering
through
the
paved
yard
in
his
tackety
boots
and
handed
in
a
blue
envelope
at
the
back
door
with
a
air
his
ferrety
eyes
searching
gourlay
face
as
she
took
the
letter
from
his
hand
but
she
betrayed
nothing
to
his
curiosity
since
she
knew
nothing
of
her
husband
affairs
and
had
no
fear
therefore
of
what
the
letter
might
portend
she
received
the
missive
with
a
vacant
unconcern
it
was
addressed
to
john
gourlay
esquire
she
turned
it
over
in
a
silly
puzzlement
and
janet
she
cried
what
am
i
to
do
wi
this
she
shrank
from
opening
a
letter
addressed
to
her
dead
tyrant
unless
she
had
janet
by
her
side
it
was
so
many
years
since
he
had
allowed
her
to
take
an
active
interest
in
their
common
life
indeed
he
never
had
that
she
was
as
helpless
as
a
child
it
to
faither
said
janet
shall
i
waken
john
no
puir
fellow
let
him
sleep
said
his
mother
i
stole
in
to
look
at
him
enow
and
his
face
was
unco
wan
lying
down
on
the
pillow
open
the
letter
mysell
though
as
your
faither
used
to
tell
me
i
never
had
a
heid
for
business
she
broke
the
seal
and
janet
looking
over
her
shoulder
read
aloud
to
her
slower
mind
glasgow

desire
once
more

call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that

arrears
of

not
been
paid
our
client
is
unwilling
to
proceed
to

forced

take
the
necessary
steps
to
safeguard

faithfully
brodie
gurney
yarrowby
gourlay
sank
into
a
chair
and
the
letter
slipped
from
her
upturned
palm
lying
slack
upon
her
knee
janet
she
said
appealingly
what
this
that
has
come
on
us
does
the
house
we
live
in
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
not

lassie
what

whispered
janet
with
big
eyes
did
faither
never
tell
ye
of
the
bond
he
never
telled
me
about
anything
cried
gourlay
with
a
sudden
passion
i
was
aye
the
one
to
be
keepit
in
the
dark
to
be
keepit
in

in
my
auld
age
oh
faither
faither
her
mind
flashed
back
to
the
jocose
and
father
who
had
been
but
a
blurred
thought
to
her
for
twenty
years
that
his
daughter
should
come
to
a
pass
like
this
was
enough
to
make
him
turn
in
his
grave
janet
was
astonished
by
her
sudden
passion
in
feebleness
even
the
murder
of
her
husband
had
been
met
by
her
weak
mind
with
a
dazed
resignation
for
her
natural
horror
at
the
deed
was
swallowed
by
her
anxiety
to
shield
the
murderer
and
she
experienced
a
vague
relief
felt
but
not
considered
at
being
freed
from
the
incubus
of
gourlay
tyranny
it
seemed
too
as
if
she
was
incapable
of
feeling
anything
poignantly
deadened
now
by
these
quick
calamities
but
that
that
tenshillingland
daughter
should
come
to
be
an
object
of
common
charity
touched
some
hidden
nerve
of
pride
and
made
her
writhe
in
agony
it
mayna
be
sae
bad
janet
tried
to
comfort
her
waken
john
said
her
mother
feverishly
waken

and
we

through
his
faither

in

john
staggered
into
the
kitchen
five
minutes
later
halfway
to
the
table
where
his
mother
sat
he
reeled
and
fell
over
on
a
chair
where
he
lay
with
an
ashen
face
his
eyes
mere
slits
in
his
head
the
upturned
whites
showing
through
they
brought
him
whisky
and
he
drank
and
was
recovered
and
then
they
went
through
to
the
parlour
and
opened
the
great
desk
that
stood
in
the
corner
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
dared
to
raise
its
lid
john
took
up
a
letter
lying
loosely
on
the
top
of
the
other
papers
and
after
a
hasty
glance
this
settles
it
said
he
it
was
the
note
from
gourlay
banker
warning
him
that
his
account
was
overdrawn
god
help
us
cried
gourlay
and
janet
began
to
whimper
john
slipped
out
of
the
room
he
was
still
in
his
and
the
women
dazed
by
this
sudden
and
appalling
news
were
scarcely
aware
of
his
departure
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
and
stood
on
the
step
of
the
back
door
looking
out
on
the
quiet
little
paved
yard
everything
there
was
remarkably
still
and
bright
it
was
an
early
spring
that
year
and
the
hot
march
sun
beat
down
on
him
paining
his
bleared
and
puffy
eyes
the
contrast
between
his
own
lump
of
a
body
and
the
warm
bright
day
came
in
on
him
with
a
sudden
sinking
of
the
heart
a
sense
of
degradation
and
personal
abasement
he
realized
however
obscurely
that
he
was
an
eyesore
in
nature
a
blotch
on
the
surface
of
the
world
an
offence
to
the
heavens
and
that
bright
silence
was
so
strange
and
still
he
could
have
screamed
to
escape
it
the
slow
ticking
of
the
kitchen
clock
seemed
to
beat
upon
his
raw
brain
damn
the
thing
why
did
it
stop
with
its
monotonous
he
could
feel
it
inside
his
head
where
it
seemed
to
strike
innumerable
little
blows
on
a
strained
chord
it
was
bent
on
snapping
he
tiptoed
back
to
the
kitchen
on
noiseless
feet
and
cocking
his
ear
to
listen
he
heard
the
murmur
of
women
voices
in
the
parlour
there
was
a
look
of
slyness
and
cunning
in
his
face
and
his
eyes
glittered
with
desire
the
whisky
was
still
on
the
table
he
seized
the
bottle
greedily
and
tilting
it
up
let
the
raw
liquid
gurgle
into
him
like
cooling
water
it
seemed
to
flood
his
parched
being
with
a
new
vitality
oh
i
doubt
we
be
gey
ill
off
he
heard
his
mother
whine
and
at
that
reminder
of
her
nearness
he
checked
the
great
satisfied
breath
he
had
begun
to
blow
he
set
the
bottle
on
the
table
bringing
the
glass
noiselessly
down
upon
the
wood
with
a
tense
unnatural
precision
possible
only
to
nerves
a
steadiness
like
the
humming
top
whirled
to
its
fastest
then
he
sped
silently
through
the
courtyard
and
locked
himself
into
the
stable
chuckling
in
drunken
triumph
as
he
turned
the
key
he
pitched
forward
on
a
litter
of
dirty
straw
and
in
a
moment
sleep
came
over
his
mind
in
a
huge
wave
of
darkness
an
hour
later
he
woke
from
a
terrible
dream
flinging
his
arms
up
to
ward
off
a
face
that
had
been
pressing
on
his
own
were
the
eyes
that
had
burned
his
brain
still
glaring
above
him
he
looked
about
him
in
drunken
wonder
from
a
a
shaft
of
golden
light
came
slanting
into
the
living
with
yellow
motes
in
the
dimness
the
world
seemed
dead
he
was
alone
in
the
silent
building
and
from
without
there
was
no
sound
then
a
panic
terror
flashed
on
his
mind
that
those
eyes
had
actually
been
here
and
were
here
with
him
still
where
he
was
locked
up
with
them
alone
he
strained
his
eyeballs
in
a
horrified
stare
at
vacancy
then
he
shut
them
in
terror
for
why
did
he
look
if
he
looked
the
eyes
might
burn
on
him
out
of
nothingness
the
innocent
air
had
become
his
enemy
pregnant
with
unseen
terrors
to
glare
at
him
to
breathe
it
stifled
him
each
draught
of
it
was
full
of
menace
with
a
shrill
cry
he
dashed
at
the
door
and
felt
in
the
clutch
of
his
ghostly
enemy
when
he
failed
to
open
it
at
once
breaking
his
nails
on
the
baffling
lock
he
mowed
and
chattered
and
stamped
and
tore
at
the
lock
frustrate
in
fear
at
last
he
was
free
he
broke
into
the
kitchen
where
his
mother
sat
weeping
she
raised
her
eyes
to
see
a
dishevelled
thing
with
bits
of
straw
scattered
on
his
clothes
and
hair
mother
he
screamed
mother
and
stopped
suddenly
his
starting
eyes
seeming
to
follow
something
in
the
room
what
are
ye
glowering
at
john
she
wailed
thae
damned
een
he
said
slowly
they
burning
my
soul
look
look
he
cried
clutching
her
thin
wrist
see
there
there
coming
round
by
the
dresser
he
screamed
in
hoarse
execration
would
ye
then
and
he
hurled
a
great
jug
from
the
table
at
the
pursuing
unseen
the
jug
struck
the
yellow
face
of
the
clock
and
the
glass
jangled
on
the
floor
gourlay
raised
her
arms
like
a
gaunt
sibyl
and
spoke
to
her
maker
quietly
as
if
he
were
a
man
before
her
in
the
room
ruin
and
murder
she
said
slowly
and
madness
and
death
at
my
nipple
like
a
child
when
will
ye
be
satisfied
drucken
wabster
wife
spread
the
news
of
course
and
that
night
it
went
humming
through
the
town
that

had
the
horrors

was
throwing

thith
would

been
a
thlap
in
the
face
till
him
wylie
looked
at
him
for
a
while
with
a
white
scunner
in
his
face
he
wore
the
musing
and
disgusted
look
of
a
man
whose
wounded
mind
retires
within
itself
to
brood
over
a
sight
of
unnatural
cruelty
the
deacon
grew
uncomfortable
beneath
his
sideward
estimating
eye
deacon
allardyce
your
heart
he
said
at
last
the
deacon
blinked
and
was
silent
tam
had
summed
him
up
there
was
no
appeal
john
dear
said
his
mother
that
evening

big
sofa
into
our

he
said
slowly
he
spoke
staringly
with
the
same
fixity
in
his
voice
and
gaze
there
was
neither
rise
nor
fall
in
his
voice
only
a
dull
level
of
intensity
you
do
mean
to
go
to
bed
john
what
for
dear
man
a
sleep
would
calm
your
mind
for
ye
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
like
a
cunning
madman
who
had
detected
her
trying
to
get
round
him
no
sleep
for
me
no
sleep
for
me
i
feared
i
would
see
the
red
een
he
whispered
the
red
een
coming
at
me
out
o
the
darkness
the
darkness
he
nodded
staring
at
her
and
breathing
the
word
the
darkness
the
darkness
the
darkness
is
the
warst
mother
he
added
in
his
natural
voice
leaning
forward
as
if
he
explained
some
simple
curious
thing
of
every
day
the
darkness
is
the
warst
you
know
i
seen
them
in
the
broad
licht
but
in
the
lobby
he
whispered
hoarsely
in
the
lobby
when
it
was
dark
in
the
lobby
they
were
terrible
just
twa
een
and
they
aye

so
feared
they
red
he
nodded
and
whispered
they
red
red
his
mouth
gaped
in
horror
and
he
stared
as
if
he
saw
them
now
he
had
boasted
long
ago
of
being
able
to
see
things
inside
his
head
in
his
drunken
hysteria
he
was
to
see
them
always
the
vision
he
beheld
against
the
darkness
of
his
mind
projected
itself
and
glared
at
him
he
was
pursued
by
a
spectre
in
his
own
brain
and
for
that
reason
there
was
no
escape
wherever
he
went
it
followed
him
o
man
john
wailed
his
mother
what
are

wouldna
persecute

no
he
said
slowly
you

that
he
never
liked

and
naebody
could
stand
his
glower
oh
he
was
a
terrible
man
faither
you
could
feel
the
passion
in
him
when
he
stood
still
he
could
throw
himsell
at
ye
without
moving
and
he
throwing
himsell
at
frae
beyond
the
grave
gourlay
beat
her
desperate
hands
her
feeble
remonstrance
was
a
snowflake
on
a
hill
to
the
dull
intensity
of
this
conviction
so
colossal
was
it
that
it
gripped
herself
and
she
glanced
dreadfully
across
her
shoulder
but
in
spite
of
her
fears

but
john
nobody

at
a
man
like
you
giving
heed
to
a
wheen
nonsense

yoursell
it
was
a
byword
in
the
place
that
he
would
haunt
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
god
help
me
cried
gourlay
what
am
i
to
do
she
piled
up
a
great
fire
in
the
parlour
and
the
three
poor
creatures
gathered
round
it
for
the
night
they
were
afraid
to
sit
in
the
kitchen
of
an
evening
for
even
the
silent
furniture
seemed
to
talk
of
the
murder
it
had
witnessed
john
was
on
a
carpet
stool
by
his
feet
his
head
resting
on
her
knee
they
heard
the
rattle
of
wilson
brake
as
it
swung
over
the
townhead
from
auchterwheeze
and
the
laughter
of
its
jovial
crew
they
heard
the
town
clock
chiming
the
lonesome
passage
of
the
hours
a
dog
was
barking
in
the
street
gradually
all
other
sounds
died
away
mother
said
john
lay
your
hand
alang
my
shouther
touching
my
neck
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
near
me
i
do
that
my
bairn
said
his
mother
and
soon
he
was
asleep
janet
was
reading
a
novel
the
children
had
their
mother
silly
gift
a
gift
of
the
of
forgetting
their
own
duties
and
their
own
sorrows
in
a
vacant
interest
which
they
found
in
books
she
had
wrapped
a
piece
of
coarse
red
flannel
round
her
head
to
comfort
a
swollen
jaw
and
her
face
appeared
from
within
like
a
tallowy
oval
i
didna
get
that
story
finished
said
gourlay
vacantly
staring
at
the
fire
her
dangling
it
was
the
remark
of
a
stricken
mind
that
speaks
vacantly
of
anything
does
herbert
montgomery
marry
sir
james
niece
no
said
janet
he
killed
at
the
war
it
a
gey
pity
of
him
it
oh
what
that
it
was
john
talking
in
his
sleep
i
have
killed
my
faither
he
said
slowly
pausing
long
between
every
phrase
i
have
killed
my
faither
i
have
killed
my
faither
and
me
he
me
he
me
it
was
the
voice
of
a
thing
not
a
man
it
swelled
and
dwelt
on
the
follow
as
if
the
horror
of
the
pursuit
made
it
moan
he
me
me
he
me
a
face
like
a
dark
mist
and
een
like
hell
oh
they
me
they
me
they
me
his
voice
seemed
to
come
from
an
infinite
distance
it
was
like
a
lost
soul
moaning
in
a
solitude
the
dog
was
barking
in
the
street
a
cry
of
the
night
came
from
far
away
that
voice
was
as
if
a
corpse
opened
its
lips
and
told
of
horrors
beyond
the
grave
it
brought
the
other
world
into
the
homely
room
and
made
it
all
demoniac
the
women
felt
the
presence
of
the
unknown
it
was
their
own
flesh
and
blood
that
spoke
the
words
and
by
their
own
quiet
hearth
but
hell
seemed
with
them
in
the
room
gourlay
drew
back
from
john
head
on
her
lap
as
from
something
monstrous
and
unholy
but
he
moaned
in
deprivation
craving
her
support
and
she
edged
nearer
to
supply
his
need
possessed
with
a
devil
or
no
he
was
her
son
mother
gasped
janet
suddenly
the
white
circles
of
her
eyes
staring
from
the
red
flannel
her
voice
hoarse
with
a
new
fear
mother
suppose
suppose
he
said
that
before
anybody
else
do
mentio
cried
her
mother
with
sudden
passion
how
daur
ye
how
daur
ye
my
god
she
broke
down
and
wept
they
would
hang
him
so
they
would
they
would
hang
boy
they
would
take
and
hang
boy
they
stared
at
each
other
wildly
john
slept
his
head
twisted
over
on
his
mother
knee
his
eyes
sunken
his
mouth
wide
open
mother
janet
whispered
you
must
send
him
away
i
have
only
three
pounds
in
the
world
said
gourlay
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
breast
where
it
was
but
winced
as
if
a
pain
had
bitten
her
send
him
away
said
janet
the
furniture
may
bring
something
and
you
and
me
can
aye
thole
in
the
morning
gourlay
brought
two
greasy
notes
to
the
table
and
placed
them
in
her
son
slack
hand
he
was
saner
now
he
had
slept
off
his
drunken
madness
through
the
night
john
she
said
in
pitiful
appeal
you
maunna
stay
here
laddie
ye
gie
up
the
drink
when
you
away
will

and
then

john

she
pleaded
if

janet
and
me
will

grand
education

a
place
as
a
teacher
or
something
i
sure

make
a
grand
teacher
ye
wouldna
like
to
think
of
your
mother
trailing
every
week
to
the
like
of
wilson
for
an
awmous
streeking
out
her
auld
hand
for
charity
the
folk
would
stand
in
their
doors
to
look
at
me
man
they
would
that
they
would
cry
ben
to
each
other
to
come
oot
and
see
gourlay
wife
gaun
slinkin
doon
the
brae
doon
the
brae
it
would
be
she
repeated
doon
the
brae
it
would
be
and
her
mind
drifted
away
on
the
sorrowful
future
which
her
fear
made
so
vivid
and
real
it
was
only
john
going
that
roused
her
thomas
brodie
glowering
abroad
from
a
shop
door
festooned
in
boots
his
leather
apron
in
front
and
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
as
befitted
an
important
man
saw
young
gourlay
pass
the
cross
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
and
dwindle
up
the
road
to
the
station
where
off
to
now
he
muttered
there
something
at
the
boddom
o
this
if
a
body
could
find
it
out
chapter
xxvii
when
john
had
gone
his
mother
roused
herself
to
a
feverish
industry
even
in
the
early
days
of
her
strength
she
had
never
been
so
busy
in
her
home
but
her
work
was
aimless
and
to
no
purpose
when
tidying
she
would
take
a
cup
without
its
saucer
from
the
table
and
set
off
with
it
through
the
room
but
stopping
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
would
fall
into
a
muse
with
the
dish
in
her
hand
coming
to
herself
long
afterwards
to
ask
vaguely
what
this
cup
for
janet
lassie
what
was
it
i
was
doing
her
energy
and
its
frustration
had
the
same
reason
the
burden
on
her
mind
constantly
impelled
her
to
do
something
to
escape
from
it
and
the
same
burden
paralyzed
her
mind
in
everything
she
did
so
with
another
of
her
vacant
whims
every
morning
she
rose
at
an
unearthly
hour
to
fish
out
of
old
closets
bellied
big
with
the
odds
and
ends
of
thirty
years
assemblage
i
make
a
patchwork
quilt
o
thir
she
explained
with
a
foolish
eager
smile
and
she
spent
hours
snatching
up
rags
and
vainly
trying
to
match
them
but
the
quilt
made
no
progress
she
would
look
at
a
patch
for
a
while
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
pat
it
all
over
with
restless
hands
then
she
would
turn
it
round
to
see
if
it
would
look
better
that
way
only
to
tear
it
off
when
it
was
half
sewn
to
try
another
and
yet
another
often
she
would
forget
the
work
on
her
lap
and
stare
across
the
room
her
fingers
plucking
at
her
withered
throat
janet
became
afraid
of
her
mother
once
she
saw
her
smiling
to
herself
when
she
thought
nobody
was
watching
her
an
uncanny
smile
as
of
one
who
hugged
a
secret
to
her
breast
a
secret
that
eluding
others
would
enable
its
holder
to
elude
them
too
what
can
have
to
laugh
at
janet
wondered
at
times
the
haze
that
seemed
gathering
round
gourlay
mind
would
be
dispelled
by
sudden
rushes
of
fear
when
she
would
whimper
lest
her
son
be
hanged
or
herself
come
on
the
parish
in
her
old
age
but
that
was
rarely
her
brain
was
mercifully
dulled
and
her
days
were
passed
in
a
restless
vacancy
she
was
sitting
with
the
rags
scattered
round
her
when
john
walked
in
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
there
were
rags
everywhere
on
the
table
and
all
about
the
kitchen
she
sat
in
their
midst
like
a
witch
among
the
autumn
leaves
when
she
looked
towards
his
entrance
the
smell
of
drink
was
wafted
from
the
door
john
she
panted
in
surprise
john
did
ye
not
go
to
glasgow
boy
ay
he
said
slowly
i
gaed
to
glasgow
and
the
bond
john
did
ye
speir
about
the
bond
ay
he
said
i
speired
about
the
bond
the
whole
house
is
sunk
i
oh
she
gasped
and
the
whole
world
seemed
to
go
from
beneath
her
so
weak
did
she
feel
through
her
limbs
john
she
said
after
a
while
did
ye
no
try
to
get
something
to
do
that
you
might
help
me
and
janet
now
we
helpless
no
he
said
for
the
een
wouldna
let
me
nicht
and
day
they
follow
me
nicht
and
day
are
they
following
ye
yet
john
she
whispered
leaning
forward
seriously
she
did
not
try
to
disabuse
him
now
she
accepted
what
he
said
her
mind
was
on
a
level
with
his
own
are
they
following
ye
yet
she
asked
with
large
eyes
of
sympathy
and
awe
ay
and
waur
than
ever
too
they
getting
redder
and
redder
not
a
dull
red
he
said
with
a
faint
return
of
his
old
interest
in
the
curious
physical
it
a
gleaming
red
they
lowe
a
last
nicht
they
wouldna
let
me
sleep
there
was
nae
gas
in
my
room
and
when
the
candle
went
out
i
could
see
them
everywhere
when
i
looked
to
one
corner
o
the
room
they
were
there
and
when
i
looked
to
another
corner
they
were
there
too
glowering
at
me
glowering
at
me
in
the
darkness
glowering
at
me
ye
mind
what
a
glower
he
had
i
hid
from
them
ablow
the
claes
but
they
followed
me
they
were
burning
in
my
brain
so
i
gaed
oot
and
stood
by
a
for
company
but
a
constable
moved
me
on
he
said
i
was
drunk
because
i
muttered
to
mysell
but
i
wasna
drunk
then
mother
i
so
i
walkit
on
and
on
and
on
the
whole
nicht
but
i
aye
keepit
to
the
for
company
and
than
when
the
opened
i
gaed
in
and
drank
and
drank
i
didna
like
the
drink
for
whisky
has
no
taste
to
me
now
but
it
helps
ye
to
forget
mother
he
went
on
complainingly
is
it
no
queer
that
a
pair
of
een
should
follow
a
man
just
a
pair
of
een
it
never
happened
to
onybody
but
me
he
said
dully
never
to
onybody
but
me
his
mother
was
panting
as
if
she
choked
for
air
both
hands
clutching
at
her
bosom
ay
she
whispered
it
queer
and
kept
on
gasping
at
intervals
with
staring
eyes
it
gey
queer
gey
queer
it
gey
queer
she
took
up
the
needle
once
more
and
tried
to
sew
but
her
hand
was
trembling
so
violently
that
she
pricked
the
left
forefinger
which
upheld
her
work
she
was
content
thereafter
to
make
loose
stabs
at
the
cloth
with
a
result
that
she
made
great
stitches
which
drew
her
seam
together
in
a
pucker
vacantly
she
tried
to
smooth
them
out
stroking
them
over
with
her
hand
constantly
stroking
and
to
no
purpose
john
watched
the
aimless
work
with
dull
and
heavy
eyes
for
a
while
there
was
silence
in
the
kitchen
janet
was
coughing
in
the
room
above
there
just
ae
thing
end
it
said
john
mother
give
me
three
shillings
it
was
not
a
request
and
not
a
demand
it
was
the
dull
statement
of
a
need
yet
the
need
appeared
so
relentless
uttered
in
the
set
fixity
of
his
impassive
voice
that
she
could
not
gainsay
it
she
felt
that
this
was
not
merely
her
son
making
a
demand
it
was
a
compulsion
on
him
greater
than
himself
there
the
money
she
said
clinking
it
down
on
the
table
and
flashed
a
resentful
smile
at
him
close
upon
the
brink
of
tears
she
had
a
fleeting
anger
it
was
scarcely
at
him
though
it
was
at
the
fate
that
drove
him
nor
was
it
for
herself
for
her
own
mood
was
well
well
let
it
gang
but
she
had
a
sense
of
unfairness
and
a
flicker
of
quite
impersonal
resentment
that
fate
should
wring
the
last
few
shillings
from
a
poor
being
it
wasna
fair
she
had
the
emotion
of
it
and
it
spoke
in
the
strange
look
at
her
son
and
in
the
smiling
flush
with
the
tears
behind
it
then
she
sank
into
apathy
john
took
up
the
money
and
went
out
heedless
of
his
mother
where
she
sat
by
the
table
he
had
a
doom
on
him
and
could
see
nothing
that
did
not
lie
within
his
path
nor
did
she
take
any
note
of
his
going
she
was
callous
the
tie
between
them
was
being
annulled
by
misery
she
was
ceasing
to
be
his
mother
he
to
be
her
son
they
were
not
younger
and
older
they
were
the
equal
victims
of
necessity
fate
set
each
of
them
apart
to
dree
a
separate
weird
in
a
house
of
long
years
of
misery
the
weak
become
callous
to
their
dearest
agony
the
hard
strong
characters
are
kindest
in
the
end
they
will
help
while
their
hearts
are
breaking
but
the
weak
fall
asunder
at
the
last
it
was
not
that
gourlay
was
thinking
of
herself
rather
than
of
him
she
was
stunned
by
fate
as
was
he
and
could
think
of
nothing
ten
minutes
later
john
came
out
of
the
black
bull
with
a
bottle
of
whisky
it
was
a
mellow
evening
one
of
those
evenings
when
barbie
the
mean
and
dull
is
transfigured
to
a
purity
and
catches
a
radiance
there
was
a
dreaming
sky
above
the
town
and
its
light
less
came
to
the
earth
than
was
on
it
shining
in
every
path
with
a
gracious
immanence
john
came
on
through
the
glow
with
his
burden
undisguised
wrapped
in
a
tissue
paper
which
showed
its
outlines
he
stared
right
before
him
like
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
and
never
once
looked
to
either
side
at
word
of
his
coming
the
doors
were
filled
with
mutches
and
bald
heads
keeking
by
the
jambs
to
get
a
look
many
were
indecent
in
their
haste
not
waiting
till
he
passed
ere
they
peeped
which
was
their
usual
way
some
even
stood
away
out
in
front
of
their
doors
to
glower
at
him
advancing
turning
slowly
with
him
as
he
passed
and
glowering
behind
him
as
he
went
they
saw
they
might
do
so
with
impunity
that
he
did
not
see
them
but
walked
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
passed
up
the
street
and
through
the
square
beneath
a
hundred
eyes
the
sun
shining
softly
round
him
every
eye
followed
till
he
disappeared
through
his
own
door
he
went
through
the
kitchen
where
his
mother
sat
carrying
the
bottle
openly
and
entered
the
parlour
without
speaking
he
came
back
and
asked
her
for
the
corkscrew
but
when
she
said
eh
with
a
vague
wildness
in
her
manner
and
did
not
seem
to
understand
he
went
and
got
it
for
himself
she
continued
making
stabs
at
her
cloth
and
smoothing
out
the
puckers
in
her
seam
john
was
heard
moving
in
the
parlour
there
was
the
sharp
of
a
cork
being
drawn
followed
by
a
clink
of
glass
and
then
came
a
heavy
thud
like
a
fall
to
gourlay
the
sounds
meant
nothing
she
heard
them
with
her
ear
not
her
mind
the
world
around
her
had
retreated
to
a
hazy
distance
so
that
it
had
no
meaning
she
would
have
gazed
vaguely
at
a
shell
about
to
burst
beside
her
in
the
evening
janet
who
had
been
in
bed
all
the
afternoon
came
down
and
lit
the
lamp
for
her
mother
it
was
a
large
lamp
which
gourlay
had
bought
and
it
shed
a
rich
light
through
the
room
i
heard
john
come
in
she
said
turning
wearily
round
but
i
was
too
ill
to
come
down
and
ask
what
had
happened
where
is
he
john
questioned
her
mother
john
ou
ay
she
panted
vaguely
recalling
ou
ay
i
think
i
think
he
gaed
ben
the
parlour
the
parlour
cried
janet
but
he
must
be
in
the
dark
and
he
canna
thole
the
darkness
john
she
cried
going
to
the
parlour
door
john
there
was
a
silence
of
the
grave
she
lit
a
candle
and
went
into
the
room
and
then
she
gave
a
squeal
like
a
rabbit
in
a
dog
jaws
gourlay
dragged
her
gaunt
limbs
wearily
across
the
floor
by
the
wavering
light
which
shook
in
janet
hand
she
saw
her
son
lying
dead
across
the
sofa
the
on
the
table
was
half
empty
and
of
a
smaller
bottle
beside
it
he
had
drunk
a
third
he
had
taken
all
that
whisky
that
he
might
deaden
his
mind
to
the
horror
of
swallowing
the
poison
his
legs
had
slipped
to
the
floor
when
he
died
but
his
body
was
lying
back
across
the
couch
his
mouth
open
his
eyes
staring
horridly
up
they
were
not
the
eyes
of
the
quiet
dead
but
bulged
in
frozen
fear
as
if
his
father
eyes
had
watched
him
from
aloft
while
he
died
there
twa
thirds
of
the
poison
left
commented
gourlay
mother
janet
screamed
and
shook
her
mother
john
deid
deid
do
ye
see
john
deid
ay
he
deid
said
gourlay
staring
he
winna
be
hanged
now
mother
cried
janet
desperate
before
this
apathy
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
shall
i
run
and
bring
the
neebours
the
neebours
said
gourlay
rousing
herself
wildly
the
neebours
what
have
to
do
with
the
neebours
we
are
by
ourselves
the
gourlays
whom
god
has
cursed
we

she
whispered
wildly
ay
she
nodded
smiling
with
mad
significance
i
tell
ye
something
i
tell
ye
something
and
she
dragged
janet
to
the
kitchen
janet
heart
was
rent
for
her
brother
but
the
frenzy
on
her
mother
killed
sorrow
with
a
new
fear
janet
smiled
gourlay
with
insane
soft
interest
janet
d
mind
yon
nicht
langsyne
when
your
faither
came
in
wi
a
terrible
look
in
his
een
and
struck
me
in

she
whispered
hoarsely
staring
at
the
fire
he
struck
me
in
the
breist
but
i
didna

she
shook
her

he
never

whispered
janet
i

weel
an
abscess
o
some
kind

but

and
broke
till

she
cried
tearing
open
her
bosom
and
janet
head
flung
back
in
horror
and
disgust
o
mother
she
panted
was
it
that
that
the
wee
clouts

her
mother

with
pride
i
never
let

when
your
faither
nipped

wi
his
tongue
it
nipped
me
its
pain
and
woman

that

when

was
i
enjoyed
the
pain
o
my
poor
poor
mother
cried
janet
with
a
bursting
sob
her
eyes
raining
hot
tears
her
very
body
seemed
to
feel
compassion
it
quivered
and
crept
near
as
though
it
would
brood
over
her
mother
and
protect
her
she
raised
the
poor
hand
and
kissed
it
and
fondled
it
between
her
own
but
her
mother
had
forgotten
the
world
in
one
of
her
wild
lapses
and
was
staring
fixedly
i
no
lang
be
a
burden
to
onybody
she
said
to
herself
it
should
sune
be
wearing
to
a
heid
now
but
i
thought
of
something
the
day
john
gaed

i
thought
of
something
she
said
vaguely
janet
what
was
it
i
was
thinking
of
i
dinna
ken
whispered
janet
i
was
thinking
of
something
her
mother
mused
her
voice
all
through
was
a
voice
remote
from
understanding
yes

young
jenny

in
a
passionless
voice
i
no

on
the
parish
i
miss
richmond
o
tenshillingland
she
had
no
interest
in
her
own
suggestion
it
was
an
idea
that
had
flitted
through
her
mind
before
which
came
back
to
her
now
in
feeble
recollection
she
seemed
not
to
wait
for
an
answer
to
have
forgotten
what
she
said
o
mother
cried
janet
there
a
curse
on
us

would
work
my

the
same
i
didna
ken
were
just
the
same
she
looked
her
mother
was
not
listening
suddenly
gourlay
screamed
with
wild
laughter
and
laughing
eyed
with
mirthless
merriment
the
look
of
horror
with
which
janet
was
regarding
her
ha
ha
ha
she
screamed
it
to
be
a
clean
sweep
the
gourlays
ha
ha
ha
it
to
be
a
clean
sweep
o
the
gourlays
there
is
nothing
uglier
in
life
than
a
woman
cruel
laugh
but
gourlay
laugh
was
more
than
cruel
it
was
demoniac
the
skirl
of
a
human
being
carried
by
misery
beyond
the
confines
of
humanity
janet
stared
at
her
in
speechless
fear
mother
she
whispered
at
last
what
are
we
to
do
there
of
the
poison
left
said
gourlay
mother
cried
janet
gourlay
dochter
may
gang
on
the
parish
if
she
likes
but
his
wife
never
will
may
hoast
yourself
to
death
in
a
garret
in
the
poorhouse
but
follow
my
boy
the
sudden
picture
of
her
own
lonely
death
as
a
pauper
among
strangers
when
her
mother
and
brother
should
be
gone
was
so
appalling
to
janet
that
to
die
with
her
mother
seemed
pleasanter
she
could
not
bear
to
be
left
alone
mother
she
cried
in
a
frenzy
i
keep
ye
company
let
us
read
a
chapter
said
gourlay
she
took
down
the
big
bible
and
the
thirteent
chapter
o
first
corinthians
she
announced
in
a
loud
voice
as
if
giving
it
out
from
the
pulpit
the
thirteent
o
the
first
corinthians
i
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
and
have
not
charity
i
am
become
as
sounding
brass
or
a
tinkling
though
i
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
understand
all
mysteries
and
all
knowledge
and
though
i
have
all
faith
so
that
i
could
remove
mountains
and
have
not
charity
i
am
nothing
gourlay
manner
had
changed
she
was
in
the
high
exaltation
of
madness
callous
she
still
appeared
so
possessed
by
her
general
doom
that
she
had
no
sense
of
its
particular
woes
but
she
was
listless
no
more
willing
her
death
she
seemed
to
borrow
its
greatness
and
become
one
with
the
law
that
punished
her
arrogating
the
almighty
function
to
expedite
her
doom
she
was
the
equal
of
the
most
high
it
was
her
feebleness
that
made
her
great
because
in
her
feebleness
she
yielded
entirely
to
the
fate
that
swept
her
on
she
was
imbued
with
its
demoniac
power
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
charity
envieth
not
charity
vaunteth
not
itself
is
not
puffed
up
not
behave
itself
unseemly
seeketh
not
her
own
is
not
easily
provoked
thinketh
no
evil
not
in
iniquity
but
rejoiceth
in
the
truth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
never
faileth
but
whether
there
be
prophecies
they
shall
fail
whether
there
be
tongues
they
shall
cease
whether
there
be
knowledge
it
shall
vanish
we
know
in
part
and
we
prophesy
in
when
that
which
is
perfect
is
come
then
that
which
is
in
part
shall
be
done
away
her
voice
rose
high
and
shrill
as
she
read
the
great
verses
her
large
blue
eyes
shone
with
ecstasy
janet
looked
at
her
in
fear
this
was
more
than
her
mother
speaking
it
was
more
than
human
it
was
a
voice
from
beyond
the
world
alone
the
timid
girl
would
have
shrunk
from
death
but
her
mother
inspiration
held
her
now
abideth
faith
hope
charity
these
three
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
janet
had
been
listening
with
such
strained
attention
that
the
amen
rang
out
of
her
loud
and
involuntary
like
an
answer
to
a
compelling
deity
she
had
clung
to
this
reading
as
the
one
thing
left
to
her
before
death
and
out
of
her
nature
thus
strained
to
listen
the
amen
came
as
sped
by
an
inner
will
she
scarcely
knew
that
she
said
it
they
rose
and
the
scrunt
of
janet
chair
on
the
floor
when
she
pushed
it
behind
her
sent
a
thrilling
shiver
through
her
body
so
tense
was
her
mood
they
stood
with
their
hands
on
their
chair
backs
and
looked
at
each
other
in
a
curious
palsy
of
the
will
the
first
step
to
the
parlour
door
would
commit
them
to
the
deed
to
take
it
was
to
take
the
poison
and
they
paused
feeling
its
significance
to
move
was
to
give
themselves
to
the
irrevocable
when
they
stirred
at
length
they
felt
as
if
the
ultimate
crisis
had
been
passed
there
could
be
no
return
gourlay
had
janet
by
the
wrist
she
turned
and
looked
at
her
daughter
and
for
one
fleeting
moment
she
ceased
to
be
above
humanity
janet
she
said
wistfully
have
had
a
heap
to
thole
maybe
the
lord
jesus
christ
no
be
owre
sair
on
me
o
mother
janet
screamed
yielding
to
her
terror
when
her
mother
weakened
o
mother
i
feared
i
feared
o
mother
i
feared
come
said
her
mother
come
and
drew
her
by
the
wrist
they
went
into
the
parlour
the
post
was
a
little
man
with
a
bristle
of
grizzled
hair
about
his
twisted
mouth
perpetually
cocking
up
an
face
in
the
sight
of
heaven
physically
and
morally
he
had
in
him
something
both
of
the
scotch
terrier
and
the
london
sparrow
the
shagginess
of
the
one
the
cocked
eye
of
the
other
the
one
snarling
temper
the
other
assured
impudence
in
gourlay
day
he
had
never
got
by
the
gateway
of
the
yard
much
as
he
had
wanted
to
come
further
gourlay
had
an
eye
for
a
thing
like
him
damn
the
gurly
brute
postie
complained
once
when
i
passed
a
pleasand
remark
about
the
weather
the
other
morning
he
just
looked
at
me
and
blew
the
reek
of
his
pipe
in
my
face
and
that
was
his
only
answer
now
that
gourlay
was
gone
however
postie
clattered
through
the
yard
every
morning
right
up
to
the
back
door
a
heap
o
correspondence
mornin
he
would
simper
his
greedy
little
eye
trying
to
glean
revelations
from
the
women
faces
as
they
took
the
letters
from
his
hand
on
the
morning
after
young
gourlay
came
home
for
the
last
time
postie
was
pelting
along
with
his
quick
thudding
step
near
the
head
of
the
square
when
whom
should
he
meet
but
sandy
toddle
still
unwashed
and
yawning
from
his
bed
it
was
early
and
the
streets
were
empty
except
where
in
the
distance
the
bent
figure
of
an
old
man
was
seen
hirpling
off
to
his
work
first
twisting
round
stiffly
to
cock
his
eye
right
and
left
at
the
sky
to
forecast
the
weather
for
the
day
from
the
chimneys
the
fair
white
spirlies
of
reek
were
rising
in
the
pure
air
the
gourlays
did
not
seem
to
be
stirring
yet
there
was
no
smoke
above
their
to
show
that
there
was
life
within
postie
jerked
his
thumb
across
his
shoulder
at
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
there
be
chynges
there
the
day
he
said
chirruping
toddle
breathed
in
a
hoarse
whisper
of
astonishment
sequesteration
and
he
stared
with
his
brows
arched
something
o

turned
and
stared
at
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
gawcey
and
substantial
on
its
terrace
beneath
the
tremulous
beauty
of
the
dawn

unfair

sluts
said
he
with
a
humph
of
disgust
they
still
on
their
backs
it
seems
he
knocked
again
the
sound
of
his
knuckles
on
the
door
rang
out
hollowly
as
if
there
was
nothing
but
emptiness
within
while
he
waited
he
turned
on
the
step
and
looked
idly
at
the
courtyard
the
inwalled
little
place
was
curiously
still
at
last
in
his
impatience
he
turned
the
handle
when
to
his
surprise
the
door
opened
and
let
him
enter
the
leaves
of
a
bible
fluttered
in
the
fresh
wind
from
the
door
a
large
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
its
big
yellow
flame
was
unnatural
in
the
sunshine
said
postie
tossing
his
chin
in
disgust
little
wonder
everything
gaed
to
wreck
and
ruin
in
this
house
the
slovens
have
left
the
lamp
burning
the
whole
nicht
lang
but
less
licht
serve
them
now
i
thinking
a
few
dead
ashes
were
sticking
from
the
lower
bars
of
the
range
postie
crossed
to
the
fireplace
and
looked
down
at
the
fender
that
bright
spot
would
be
the
place
now
where
auld
gourlay
killed
himself
the
women
must
have
rubbed
it
so
bright
in
trying
to
get
out
the
blood
it
was
an
uncanny
thing
to
keep
in
the
house
that
he
stared
at
the
fatal
spot
till
he
grew
eerie
in
the
strange
stillness
guidwife
he
cried
jennet
do
ye
hear
they
did
not
hear
it
seemed
god
said
he
they
sleep
sound
after
all
their
misfortunes
at
last
partly
in
impatience
and
partly
from
a
wish
to
pry
he
opened
the
door
of
the
parlour
my
god
he
screamed
leaping
back
and
with
his
bulky
bag
got
stuck
in
the
kitchen
door
in
his
desperate
hurry
to
be
gone
he
ran
round
to
the
square
in
front
and
down
to
sandy
toddle
who
was
informing
a
bunch
of
unshaven
bodies
that
the
gourlays
were
sequestered
oh
my
god
post
what
have
you
seen
to
bring
that
look
to
your
eyes
what
have
you
seen
man
speak
for
god
sake
what
is
it
the
post
gasped
and
stammered
then
ooh
he
shivered
in
horror
and
covered
his
eyes
at
a
sudden
picture
in
his
brain
speak
said
a
man
solemnly
they
have
they
have
they
have
a
killed
themselves
stammered
the
postman
pointing
to
the
gourlays
their
loins
were
loosened
beneath
them
the
scrape
of
their
feet
on
the
road
as
they
turned
to
stare
sounded
monstrous
in
the
silence
no
man
dared
to
speak
they
gazed
with
blanched
faces
at
the
house
with
the
green
shutters
sitting
dark
there
and
terrible
beneath
the
radiant
arch
of
the
dawn
printed
in
great
britain
