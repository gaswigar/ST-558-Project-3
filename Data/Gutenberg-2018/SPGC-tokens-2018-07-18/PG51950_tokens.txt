upon

desert
s
dusty
a
little
hour
or
two
is
iceland
had
never
looked
more
wonderful
the
stern
old
northland
which
in
the
daylight
bears
always
and
everywhere
on
its
face
the
mutilating
imprint
of
the
fires
of
ten
thousand
ages
and
would
seem
to
be
dead
but
for
the
murmurings
of
volcanic
life
in
its
sulfurous
womb
lay
in
the
autumn
moonlight
like
a
great
creature
asleep
calm
august
and
blue
as
the
night
the
moon
was
still
shining
and
everything
seemed
to
swim
in
the
soft
grace
of
its
silvery
light
houses
ships
the
fiord
in
front
the
lake
behind
the
black
moorland
around
and
the
mountains
beyond
when
the
little
wooden
capital
began
to
stir
in
the
morning
it
was
the
day
appointed
for
the
annual
at
thingvellir
the
was
thirty
odd
miles
away
there
were
no
railways
or
coaches
and
few
roads
in
iceland
and
hence
the
younger
townspeople
who
intended
to
make
a
holiday
of
the
event
had
to
set
out
early
on
their
little
shaggy
ponies
as
the
clock
struck
four
in
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
thora
neilsen
the
daughter
of
factor
neilsen
awoke
with
a
start
and
leapt
out
of
bed
she
had
drawn
up
her
blinds
the
night
before
so
that
the
daylight
might
waken
her
in
the
morning
but
before
she
realized
that
it
was
the
moonlight
that
had
been
playing
upon
her
eyelids
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
crying
in
the
ringing
voice
of
youth
and
happiness
aunt
margret
auntie
i
ve
overslept
myself
i
ll
be
late
auntie
auntie
then
the
measured
and
sonorous
breathing
which
had
been
coming
through
an
open
door
from
the
adjoining
room
was
interrupted
by
an
older
voice
a
voice
trying
to
be
angry
and
saying
drowsily
drat
the
girl
she
ll
waken
the
whole
house
this
was
followed
by
the
creaking
of
a
bed
and
the
thud
of
bare
feet
on
the
floor
accompanied
by
a
running
fire
of
grumbling
in
which
the
speaker
reminded
herself
that
she
was
not
a
cat
capable
of
sleeping
in
the
daytime
and
if
she
had
to
be
called
up
in
the
dead
of
night
she
might
at
least
be
permitted
to
wash
her
face
the
girl
listened
for
a
moment
and
laughed
the
light
and
joyous
laugh
of
the
soul
that
has
never
known
sorrow
she
was
young
and
unusually
fair
her
height
was
under
rather
than
over
the
average
height
of
woman
and
if
her
face
was
not
beautiful
it
produced
the
effect
of
beauty
being
one
of
those
faces
which
have
a
smile
always
playing
upon
them
even
when
the
owner
does
not
know
it
to
be
there
she
lit
her
candles
dropped
her
venetians
and
began
to
dress
herself
humming
a
tune
to
show
she
was
not
concerned
by
this
time
the
rumbling
artillery
from
the
next
apartment
entered
the
room
in
the
person
of
an
elderly
lady
who
looked
more
than
usually
grotesque
if
it
is
fair
to
take
her
at
such
a
moment
in
abbreviated
underwear
and
small
calico
nightcap
with
bobs
of
hair
in
papers
about
her
forehead
like
barnacles
on
the
figurehead
of
a
ship
that
is
fresh
from
a
long
service
in
foreign
waters
this
was
aunt
margret
with
goodness
written
on
every
line
of
her
old
face
but
with
a
tongue
that
fell
like
a
fountain
on
sharp
stones
and
knew
nothing
of
dry
weather
the
moment
she
set
eyes
on
thora
in
the
preliminary
stages
of
her
toilet
she
cried
silk
at
this
time
in
the
morning
and
who
is
to
see
them
under
your
big
boots
if
you
please
the
girl
laughed
at
this
as
she
laughed
at
everything
and
said
very
well
give
me
the
woollen
ones
then
but
what
a
cross
old
thing
you
are
auntie
you
knew
i
had
to
get
up
early
having
a
six
hours
ride
before
me
but
who
wants
you
to
have
a
six
hours
ride
i
wonder
said
aunt
margret
bustling
about
breathlessly
to
get
the
girl
ready
you
know
quite
well
who
wants
me
auntie
magnus
wants
me
when
they
elected
him
for
the
year
i
promised
him
faithfully
that
i
would
go
to
the
and
of
course
don
t
try
to
fool
an
old
fox
my
dear
but
come
and
wash
in
this
water
it
isn
t
because
magnus
wants
you
at
the
but
because
somebody
else
is
going
to
take
you
there
auntie
cried
thora
lifting
a
dripping
face
from
the
washbasin
oh
you
needn
t
color
up
like
fire
my
precious
i
know
it
s
the
truth
without
that
how
absurd
you
are
aunt
margret
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
magnus
himself
asked
oscar
to
take
me
he
wrote
expressly
from
the
farm
not
having
seen
oscar
since
he
came
from
college
and
wanting
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
the
more
fool
he
said
aunt
margret
the
man
who
expects
to
marry
a
girl
and
asks
another
man
to
look
after
her
while
he
is
away
is
a
fool
and
his
friends
ought
to
take
care
of
him
it
s
only
the
simpleton
who
shuts
the
door
with
a
bang
behind
him
like
that
what
a
nonsensical
woman
you
are
auntie
said
thora
oscar
is
magnus
s
brother
brother
indeed
so
was
jacob
the
brother
of
esau
and
cain
was
the
brother
of
abel
and
those
ten
big
beauties
were
the
brothers
of
joseph
and
benjamin
good
gracious
me
aunt
margret
what
a
bad
disposition
you
ve
got
that
s
the
worst
of
you
you
have
got
such
a
bad
disposition
you
talk
of
oscar
stephenson
as
if
he
were
a
regular
reprobate
instead
of
the
son
of
the
governor
and
the
idol
of
everybody
it
s
easy
to
defend
some
one
whom
nobody
wants
to
strike
i
don
t
say
anything
against
oscar
of
course
you
don
t
you
cross
old
creature
you
re
fonder
of
him
than
anybody
else
and
i
believe
you
want
him
for
yourself
you
jealous
thing
because
you
think
he
is
the
brightest
and
cleverest
and
young
man
in
iceland
many
things
glitter
in
the
goldsmith
s
shop
but
a
sensible
woman
doesn
t
want
to
grab
the
whole
of
them
and
do
i
you
silly
it
looks
as
if
you
do
my
dear
but
sit
down
here
before
the
glass
and
let
me
brush
your
hair
you
are
to
be
married
to
magnus
and
your
public
betrothal
is
to
take
place
the
day
after
in
the
presence
of
both
the
families
yet
you
ve
had
oscar
here
every
day
and
all
day
since
he
came
home
from
england
a
week
ago
and
now
you
are
going
to
ride
with
him
to
thingvellir
you
ll
make
mischief
i
promise
you
two
dogs
at
the
same
bone
seldom
agree
at
that
the
girl
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughing
auntie
what
names
you
are
calling
us
better
i
should
do
so
than
somebody
else
the
people
here
are
all
ears
and
oscar
is
all
mouth
he
is
always
talking
about
you
not
always
auntie
thora
s
pretty
face
was
reddening
in
the
glass
in
front
of
her
always
only
yesterday
he
said
my
future
not
future
auntie
did
i
speak
or
did
i
not
speak
thora
my
future
is
perfectly
charming
he
said
now
i
m
sure
it
wasn
t
charming
auntie
darling
yes
it
was
and
hold
your
silly
head
quiet
miss
perfectly
charming
he
said
and
i
m
half
jealous
of
old
magnus
the
blue
eyes
in
the
glass
were
gleaming
with
delight
but
the
mouth
said
well
of
course
i
should
have
been
dreadfully
vexed
if
i
had
heard
him
say
that
but
still
it
isn
t
my
fault
fiddlesticks
said
aunt
margret
with
a
sniff
of
contempt
just
take
a
cranky
old
woman
s
advice
my
precious
and
don
t
make
trouble
between
two
brothers
then
the
shining
face
in
the
glass
became
serious
and
thoughtful
and
thora
said
how
can
you
say
such
uncomfortable
things
aunt
margret
merely
because
i
am
going
to
ride
with
oscar
to
the
oh
a
little
brook
can
start
a
big
river
but
what
s
the
use
of
talking
a
beast
can
be
broken
but
not
a
wilful
woman
then
seeing
that
the
tears
were
in
thora
s
eyes
aunt
margret
gave
the
girl
s
hair
a
softer
smoothing
and
said
magnus
may
not
be
as
clever
as
his
brother
thora
but
he
is
twenty
times
as
solid
and
steady
and
he
is
just
as
able
to
take
care
of
a
girl
and
quite
as
likely
to
make
her
happy
besides
dear
it
s
all
settled
and
done
and
the
made
road
is
easiest
to
travel
you
know
your
marriage
with
magnus
has
been
arranged
between
your
father
and
the
governor
they
have
set
their
hearts
on
it
the
contract
is
ready
and
if
anything
should
happen
now
but
thora
who
had
been
listening
with
head
aslant
to
sounds
outside
the
house
suddenly
leapt
to
her
feet
saying
i
do
believe
that
s
silvertop
s
step
there
was
a
clatter
of
hoofs
on
the
cobbles
of
the
street
and
at
the
next
moment
a
silvery
male
voice
under
the
window
was
crying
helloa
helloa
helloa
thora
ran
to
the
venetians
parted
two
blades
of
them
and
said
with
an
air
of
surprise
it
s
oscar
then
she
tapped
the
and
cried
presently
to
the
person
outside
and
stood
for
a
moment
to
look
down
at
him
a
young
man
of
sat
on
one
pony
and
held
another
by
its
bridle
he
was
tall
and
slim
almost
as
fair
as
thora
herself
and
he
had
a
cluster
of
short
curls
under
the
alpine
hat
which
he
raised
to
the
moving
blind
the
moon
had
gone
by
this
time
a
light
the
pioneer
of
the
sun
was
filtering
through
a
vaporous
atmosphere
the
ships
and
fishing
boats
in
the
bay
were
breaking
through
a
veil
of
mist
and
vague
shadows
of
men
and
women
muffled
up
to
the
throats
but
chattering
and
laughing
like
children
were
coming
and
going
in
the
gloom
of
the
streets
quick
auntie
quick
cried
thora
lowering
her
voice
and
while
the
women
in
the
bedroom
hustled
about
and
talked
in
whispers
the
young
man
waiting
outside
slapped
his
leggings
with
his
riding
whip
and
whistled
and
sang
alternate
lines
of
a
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
and
i
will
pledge
with
mine
must
i
wear
these
ugly
certainly
you
must
they
re
warm
and
comfortable
and
it
s
not
as
if
anybody
could
see
auntie
don
t
speak
so
loud
or
people
will
hear
or
leave
a
kiss
within
the
cup
and
i
ll
not
ask
for
wine
what
a
voice
he
has
i
m
certain
he
ll
make
a
success
some
day
maybe
so
but
people
don
t
feed
on
voices
not
in
iceland
anyway
here
s
your
for
goodness
sake
aunt
margret
the
thirst
that
from
the
soul
doth
come
doth
ask
a
draught
divine
now
for
my
hat
if
i
have
to
wear
this
old
black
riding
habit
i
must
have
something
sweet
on
my
head
at
all
events
that
one
with
the
feather
no
this
one
and
a
veil
there
do
i
look
nice
shockingly
nice
if
you
ask
me
the
girl
laughed
gaily
and
said
in
a
louder
voice
then
let
us
go
downstairs
the
poor
boy
must
be
tired
of
waiting
and
anxious
to
be
off
not
half
so
anxious
as
the
poor
girl
i
m
thinking
then
the
smiling
face
became
serious
again
and
thora
said
don
t
say
those
dreadful
things
any
more
there
s
a
dear
soul
then
don
t
forget
my
warning
and
watch
over
your
feelings
my
precious
the
door
to
the
street
was
being
opened
by
this
time
and
a
rich
barytone
voice
mingled
with
the
soft
murmur
of
the
sea
came
floating
into
the
hall
but
might
i
of
jove
s
nectar
sip
i
would
not
change
helloa
good
morning
thora
is
that
aunt
margret
from
behind
the
bulwark
of
the
door
ajar
with
one
eye
and
two
curl
papers
visible
in
three
inches
of
opening
aunt
margret
answered
that
it
was
and
told
oscar
as
he
lifted
thora
to
the
saddle
to
take
care
of
her
child
and
deliver
her
safely
to
magnus
oscar
laughed
a
little
jauntily
and
answered
not
she
thought
with
too
much
conviction
that
ll
be
all
right
auntie
aunt
margret
thora
and
remember
at
the
next
moment
the
two
young
people
had
disappeared
in
the
mists
of
morning
amid
a
cavalcade
of
similar
shadows
dying
off
in
the
same
direction
half
an
hour
afterward
the
sun
had
risen
and
the
little
capital
was
going
merrily
the
father
of
oscar
stephenson
was
stephen
magnusson
according
to
his
icelandic
patronymic
and
he
had
been
of
iceland
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
was
a
man
of
the
highest
integrity
and
of
the
firmest
mind
in
his
public
character
he
was
zealous
and
incorruptible
and
his
private
life
was
without
stain
his
chief
characteristics
were
dignity
and
pride
the
father
of
thora
was
oscar
neilsen
commonly
called
factor
neilsen
of
icelandic
birth
but
danish
descent
and
he
was
the
chief
merchant
and
one
of
the
richest
citizens
of
the
capital
his
business
methods
had
often
been
a
subject
for
discussion
and
his
domestic
history
a
cause
of
gossip
he
was
a
man
of
untiring
industry
and
great
frugality
amounting
almost
to
greed
these
two
men
had
been
lifelong
friends
their
friendship
had
not
been
founded
on
any
hollow
commercial
league
but
nevertheless
it
had
been
cemented
by
community
of
interest
and
it
was
a
common
saying
that
the
man
who
could
break
it
could
break
the
constitution
it
was
one
of
those
friendships
that
are
young
after
fifty
years
and
are
constantly
growing
younger
because
they
are
always
growing
older
a
peculiarity
of
all
friendships
that
are
true
and
constant
and
the
reason
why
new
friendships
can
never
take
the
place
of
old
ones
half
a
word
explained
a
meaning
half
a
look
provoked
a
laugh
their
friendship
was
the
unwritten
history
of
their
past
a
living
obituary
of
memories
and
ideas
that
were
dead
it
began
in
boyhood
and
notwithstanding
varying
fortunes
and
some
family
differences
it
had
never
been
darkened
by
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
but
people
said
that
if
stephen
magnusson
and
oscar
neilsen
ever
ceased
to
be
friends
they
would
become
the
bitterest
of
enemies
they
went
through
the
latin
school
together
as
boys
and
were
two
of
four
icelandic
students
who
were
sent
with
stipends
to
the
university
at
copenhagen
that
was
in
the
days
when
student
life
was
not
so
regular
as
it
might
have
been
but
three
of
them
got
through
without
serious
damage
while
the
fourth
made
a
slip
which
was
perhaps
the
first
cause
of
the
present
story
when
the
time
came
to
separate
one
of
the
four
went
to
oxford
as
an
assistant
in
the
library
and
became
a
university
lecturer
and
another
went
to
london
to
be
clerk
in
a
bank
and
rose
to
be
manager
the
other
two
remained
faithful
to
their
nationalities
and
stephen
magnusson
returned
to
iceland
to
practise
law
while
oscar
neilsen
stayed
in
denmark
to
follow
commerce
within
ten
years
the
friends
had
made
rapid
progress
stephen
had
risen
from
advocate
to
assessor
from
assessor
to
and
from
to
while
neilsen
had
himself
in
iceland
first
as
factor
for
a
firm
in
copenhagen
and
afterward
as
a
merchant
on
his
own
responsibility
in
the
meantime
both
men
had
married
the
governor
married
the
daughter
and
only
child
of
grim
owner
of
the
farm
at
thingvellir
one
of
the
largest
farms
in
iceland
the
factor
to
everybody
s
surprise
married
before
he
returned
home
and
nobody
knew
anything
of
his
wife
except
that
she
came
from
copenhagen
but
scandal
seldom
loses
its
way
in
the
dark
and
it
was
whispered
that
the
factor
s
wife
had
been
a
little
actress
of
the
lighter
sort
and
had
been
compelled
to
marry
the
wife
of
the
governor
had
borne
him
two
sons
he
christened
the
first
of
them
magnus
after
his
father
but
the
second
he
called
oscar
after
his
friend
who
had
arrived
in
time
to
stand
godfather
at
the
baptism
in
like
manner
the
wife
of
the
factor
had
borne
two
daughters
she
brought
the
eldest
in
her
arms
when
she
arrived
in
iceland
and
the
factor
called
her
thora
after
his
mother
the
second
born
soon
afterward
he
would
have
called
anna
after
his
friend
s
wife
but
his
own
wife
objected
and
it
was
christened
helga
after
herself
there
were
not
many
years
between
the
births
of
the
children
but
magnus
was
the
eldest
and
helga
the
youngest
while
oscar
and
thora
were
almost
of
one
age
the
wives
of
the
two
friends
could
hardly
have
been
more
unlike
each
other
anna
was
homely
in
looks
dress
and
habits
in
practical
matters
she
was
a
typical
iceland
housewife
thrifty
and
economical
although
the
position
of
was
one
of
considerable
dignity
it
was
far
from
a
fat
living
and
anna
set
her
sail
according
to
the
draught
of
her
husband
s
ship
she
was
shrewd
but
not
well
educated
and
wise
but
not
enlightened
and
she
governed
the
governor
by
obeying
him
stephen
found
his
wife
his
safest
steward
and
most
faithful
counsellor
he
had
a
profound
respect
for
her
instinct
but
not
too
much
reverence
for
her
intellect
when
in
doubt
he
always
consulted
her
and
while
she
told
him
what
he
ought
to
do
he
sat
and
listened
attentively
but
as
soon
as
she
began
to
explain
her
reasons
he
got
up
and
fled
the
factor
s
wife
was
distinctly
comely
volatile
and
vain
and
her
conduct
on
coming
to
iceland
might
have
been
calculated
to
justify
the
scandal
that
was
coupled
with
her
name
she
was
extravagant
in
her
dress
unthrifty
in
her
home
restless
in
her
habits
and
romantic
in
her
tastes
and
after
a
while
she
began
to
gird
at
the
monotony
and
dreariness
of
the
life
about
her
a
light
wife
makes
a
heavy
husband
and
the
factor
who
was
not
then
rich
was
made
to
realize
that
in
marrying
his
danish
beauty
he
had
bought
a
commodity
which
he
could
neither
exchange
nor
return
a
housekeeper
who
neglected
his
house
and
a
mother
who
cared
little
for
his
children
the
children
were
the
first
to
feel
their
mother
s
loss
of
interest
in
iceland
for
while
government
house
was
forever
warm
and
joyous
with
some
noisy
festival
magnus
s
first
holiday
or
oscar
s
last
birthday
there
were
no
holidays
or
birthdays
in
their
own
home
which
was
always
quiet
and
generally
cold
but
the
mother
s
ear
is
thin
and
across
the
gap
that
opened
between
the
houses
of
the
governor
and
the
factor
anna
heard
the
hearts
of
the
little
girls
and
concocted
schemes
to
get
at
them
the
factor
s
wife
was
nothing
loth
to
be
rid
of
her
tiresome
charges
while
she
devoured
dramatic
newspapers
and
french
novels
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
thora
and
helga
spent
half
of
their
early
days
with
anna
and
that
as
long
as
they
lived
thereafter
hers
was
the
mother
s
form
that
stood
up
in
their
memory
when
they
looked
back
to
the
blue
mountains
of
childhood
and
youth
gathered
together
under
anna
s
wing
what
times
the
four
children
had
of
it
as
long
as
they
were
little
government
house
was
like
a
nest
of
and
if
at
some
moments
it
resembled
more
nearly
a
menagerie
of
monkeys
it
was
always
alive
and
always
happy
except
the
governor
s
bureau
they
took
possession
of
the
whole
place
including
the
kitchen
for
there
was
only
one
servant
in
those
days
and
she
was
as
fond
of
them
as
her
mistress
in
summer
time
they
ran
wild
over
the
and
in
winter
they
romped
through
every
room
in
the
house
anna
spoiled
the
whole
of
them
for
she
never
knew
how
to
be
cross
with
children
and
at
christmas
and
new
year
she
helped
them
to
keep
up
their
noisy
customs
boiling
the
toffy
which
they
pulled
into
twisted
sticks
amid
shrieks
of
delighted
laughter
and
lighting
the
candles
with
which
they
marched
in
awesome
procession
from
chimney
to
to
find
the
hidden
folk
from
the
hills
and
bad
fairies
who
came
to
steal
good
children
on
such
high
days
and
holidays
the
governor
and
the
factor
smoking
their
long
german
pipes
would
come
from
the
bureau
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen
to
look
on
at
the
childish
revels
and
seeing
anna
in
the
midst
of
them
like
a
fairy
godmother
grown
and
matronly
but
with
the
loveliness
of
love
still
shining
over
her
homely
face
the
governor
would
say
to
himself
god
bless
her
and
the
factor
would
mutter
god
bless
my
motherless
girls
and
then
the
two
old
friends
would
drop
their
heads
and
go
back
to
talk
politics
the
child
grows
but
his
clothes
do
not
neither
do
his
characteristics
what
the
children
of
the
governor
and
the
factor
were
at
the
beginning
of
their
lives
they
remained
to
the
end
thora
was
always
a
merry
little
woman
with
a
constant
smile
on
her
comely
face
she
was
usually
following
or
clinging
to
somebody
generally
oscar
but
she
could
sit
for
hours
coaxing
scolding
and
singing
to
her
doll
for
the
instinct
of
motherhood
was
strong
in
her
from
the
first
helga
was
at
all
points
the
opposite
of
her
sister
she
had
black
hair
a
broad
brow
large
hazel
eyes
that
were
often
half
closed
a
nose
that
was
very
slightly
turned
up
at
the
tip
and
a
large
mouth
with
thin
red
lips
which
were
generally
a
little
awry
a
witch
may
be
found
under
a
fair
complexion
and
an
angel
under
a
dark
skin
but
helga
did
not
belie
her
looks
she
was
as
bright
as
a
pebble
of
the
brook
and
just
as
hard
and
sufficient
to
herself
she
clung
to
no
one
but
loved
to
have
the
eyes
of
everybody
upon
her
she
sang
like
a
throstle
and
was
fond
of
dressing
herself
up
in
grand
disguises
of
paper
crowns
and
coronets
being
full
of
and
never
quite
able
to
distinguish
fact
from
fiction
the
sons
of
the
governor
were
not
less
unlike
each
other
magnus
was
a
big
heavy
boy
silent
and
slow
and
thought
to
be
rather
stupid
he
found
it
hard
to
learn
and
his
face
had
often
a
puzzled
expression
sometimes
a
gloomy
and
morose
one
on
the
other
hand
his
moral
character
was
as
sensitive
as
his
intellect
was
sluggish
if
he
borrowed
a
penny
he
would
never
rest
until
he
had
paid
it
back
and
if
any
one
lent
him
a
pencil
he
would
walk
a
mile
to
return
it
as
a
consequence
his
sense
of
injustice
was
keen
to
the
point
of
agony
and
he
suffered
more
from
an
unmerited
rebuke
than
from
a
blow
he
liked
best
to
visit
the
family
farm
at
thingvellir
and
when
asked
what
he
was
going
to
be
he
plumped
for
being
a
farmer
always
fond
of
animals
he
filled
the
house
with
dogs
cats
and
white
mice
and
seemed
to
love
nothing
else
except
his
mother
not
a
lovable
boy
and
a
rather
surly
and
unhappy
one
he
was
by
no
means
a
general
favorite
but
anna
was
very
fond
of
him
oscar
was
so
totally
unlike
magnus
in
every
quality
of
mind
and
heart
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
they
could
be
brothers
the
little
fellow
with
the
handsome
face
was
as
as
the
sunshine
and
as
full
of
laughter
as
a
running
river
he
could
learn
anything
without
an
effort
and
he
had
an
extraordinary
ear
for
music
before
he
could
speak
properly
he
imitated
the
notes
of
any
instrument
from
the
organ
to
the
guitar
and
before
he
knew
his
alphabet
he
wrote
mysterious
musical
hieroglyphics
on
scraps
of
paper
which
the
governor
carried
off
to
his
bureau
and
hoarded
up
like
treasures
more
precious
than
gold
but
in
giving
him
something
like
genius
nature
had
taken
away
character
without
which
genius
is
a
curse
the
merry
little
soul
did
not
seem
to
know
right
from
wrong
or
truth
from
a
lie
he
was
always
glancing
from
one
thing
to
another
like
the
sun
on
an
april
day
if
crying
one
minute
he
was
laughing
the
next
nothing
troubled
him
long
but
also
nothing
seized
and
held
him
he
began
by
announcing
that
he
intended
to
be
a
king
rather
later
he
thought
it
would
be
grander
to
be
a
general
but
going
one
evening
with
the
organist
of
the
cathedral
to
his
weekly
rehearsal
he
finally
concluded
that
to
be
would
be
best
of
all
nobody
loved
him
the
less
for
his
infirmities
of
character
for
it
is
one
of
the
whims
of
the
human
heart
that
the
people
who
run
most
strictly
within
the
laws
of
life
find
an
irresistible
fascination
in
the
recklessness
of
those
who
kick
over
the
traces
oscar
was
the
privileged
pet
of
everybody
and
the
idol
of
his
father
s
eyes
ah
stephen
you
ll
never
rear
that
boy
said
the
factor
nonsense
why
shouldn
t
i
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
you
know
that
s
only
because
they
never
grow
old
said
the
governor
from
the
first
oscar
was
fond
of
a
pageant
and
always
wanted
to
be
marching
in
procession
like
a
victorious
general
with
the
juvenile
equivalents
for
banners
and
bands
of
music
one
day
he
was
doing
so
playing
a
tune
of
his
own
composing
on
a
comb
with
helga
as
an
eager
lieutenant
thora
as
a
submissive
soldier
and
magnus
as
a
subservient
slave
behind
him
when
coming
to
a
river
that
crossed
the
a
desire
for
carnage
seized
the
general
and
backing
suddenly
on
the
narrow
bridge
he
toppled
his
followers
into
the
water
magnus
and
helga
escaped
without
serious
consequences
but
as
nobody
is
anybody
s
brother
in
a
game
thora
being
dragged
down
by
her
sister
was
drenched
to
the
skin
the
governor
came
up
at
the
moment
when
magnus
was
hauling
thora
on
to
the
bank
and
he
was
angry
was
it
an
accident
he
asked
but
the
children
did
not
answer
then
who
did
it
he
demanded
but
thora
to
whom
he
spoke
looked
first
at
oscar
and
then
at
helga
and
began
to
cry
was
it
you
oscar
oscar
hesitated
for
an
instant
but
helga
touched
his
sleeve
and
he
shook
his
head
was
it
you
helga
helga
promptly
answered
no
then
it
must
have
been
you
magnus
said
the
governor
and
magnus
flushed
crimson
all
over
his
face
and
neck
but
made
no
reply
was
it
you
magnus
s
mouth
quivered
but
still
he
did
not
speak
so
it
was
you
sir
and
you
can
go
indoors
and
to
bed
immediately
without
a
word
or
a
tear
but
with
a
look
of
defiance
magnus
wagged
his
head
and
turned
toward
the
house
seeing
him
go
oscar
wanted
to
blurt
out
the
truth
but
his
melting
eyes
encountered
helga
s
which
held
them
fast
and
he
said
nothing
it
was
one
of
anna
s
many
birthdays
and
from
the
upper
room
where
all
was
silent
and
cold
magnus
heard
the
children
s
voices
below
stairs
at
first
hushed
and
restrained
but
after
a
while
merry
enough
with
oscar
s
voice
amongst
the
rest
and
helga
s
above
everybody
s
the
laughter
and
joking
burnt
into
his
soul
and
at
last
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
then
through
the
sound
of
his
own
sobs
a
thin
whimper
came
from
somewhere
whispering
magnus
magnus
it
was
thora
at
the
keyhole
go
away
said
magnus
gruffly
but
thora
did
not
go
magnus
shall
i
tell
said
thora
and
magnus
blinked
several
times
as
the
big
tears
rained
down
his
cheeks
but
still
he
answered
go
away
i
tell
you
at
that
thora
fell
to
kissing
the
keyhole
and
magnus
had
stopped
his
sobbing
to
listen
when
he
heard
another
voice
anna
s
voice
outside
the
door
and
then
the
child
was
taken
away
as
soon
as
the
birthday
party
was
over
and
the
girls
were
gone
oscar
began
to
ask
for
magnus
but
the
governor
patted
his
curly
head
and
said
magnus
had
been
naughty
and
must
sleep
alone
that
night
half
an
hour
later
anna
found
him
crying
with
his
head
under
the
bedclothes
and
she
said
hide
nothing
from
your
father
my
child
the
governor
was
sitting
alone
in
his
bureau
when
a
little
figure
in
a
dressing
gown
came
in
with
swimming
eyes
and
trembling
lips
saying
it
wasn
t
magnus
papa
it
was
and
then
a
wild
outburst
of
weeping
the
governor
was
more
touched
by
oscar
s
confession
than
by
magnus
s
silence
he
patted
oscar
s
head
again
and
said
that
was
very
very
wrong
of
you
curly
pate
but
go
and
beg
your
brother
s
pardon
and
take
him
off
to
bed
when
anna
went
upstairs
again
she
found
two
heads
on
the
pillow
side
by
side
the
dark
as
well
as
the
fair
one
and
magnus
was
listening
and
oscar
was
talking
and
both
were
laughing
merrily
as
soon
as
the
youngest
of
the
children
was
fourteen
winters
old
they
were
confirmed
together
there
was
only
one
other
candidate
little
neils
the
sheriff
s
son
whose
mother
was
dead
in
the
preliminary
examination
it
was
expected
that
oscar
would
come
first
helga
second
neils
and
thora
next
and
magnus
last
the
rector
examined
them
and
when
the
moment
came
to
declare
the
order
of
the
candidates
he
looked
serious
and
even
severe
oscar
with
a
sparkle
in
his
eyes
was
carrying
himself
gaily
and
helga
was
at
her
ease
while
thora
and
neils
were
trembling
with
anxiety
and
magnus
was
nibbling
his
thumb
nail
for
he
was
in
dread
of
not
being
accepted
at
all
and
in
that
case
as
his
new
black
suit
had
been
bought
he
would
be
afraid
to
go
home
but
when
the
rector
had
cleared
his
throat
and
called
for
silence
he
announced
a
great
surprise
magnus
is
first
he
said
thora
second
neils
third
helga
fourth
and
oscar
oscar
is
last
then
he
turned
to
oscar
and
said
you
are
rightly
served
my
son
for
you
might
have
done
better
and
you
took
no
trouble
take
an
old
man
s
word
for
it
oscar
in
the
race
of
life
it
isn
t
always
the
rider
who
comes
in
first
that
was
the
last
to
put
on
his
spurs
oscar
was
crushed
with
shame
but
he
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
and
while
the
others
looked
at
him
to
see
what
he
would
do
helga
with
her
mouth
awry
and
thora
with
eyes
that
could
not
see
distinctly
and
a
throat
that
could
not
swallow
he
swung
about
to
where
magnus
was
standing
with
head
down
blushing
like
a
baby
and
gripped
and
shook
his
hand
it
was
a
beautiful
confirmation
service
the
cathedral
was
full
of
women
but
the
governor
was
with
anna
in
their
pew
in
the
gallery
and
the
factor
who
was
alone
sat
in
his
seat
below
the
children
knelt
in
a
line
on
the
lower
step
of
the
communion
rail
the
girls
in
muslin
frocks
and
veils
and
the
boys
in
black
suits
and
white
gloves
the
morning
was
bright
and
warm
and
the
sun
was
shining
from
the
chancel
windows
on
to
the
five
drooping
heads
as
the
old
bishop
laid
his
hands
on
them
one
by
one
when
the
little
ones
had
made
their
vows
the
bishop
delivered
an
address
be
true
be
strong
be
faithful
think
of
the
covenant
you
have
made
with
god
and
resist
temptation
if
satan
tempts
you
with
the
treasures
of
this
life
remember
that
wealth
and
power
are
only
for
a
day
while
a
dishonored
name
is
for
a
thousand
years
love
one
another
my
children
no
one
knows
how
soon
the
world
may
separate
you
or
with
what
sorrow
and
tears
you
may
yet
be
torn
asunder
but
keep
together
as
long
as
you
can
and
may
god
love
and
bless
you
all
the
service
ended
with
the
confirmation
hymn
which
the
children
sang
by
themselves
anna
the
governor
and
the
factor
were
deeply
affected
ah
the
sweet
and
happy
time
of
childhood
if
the
children
could
only
remain
children
but
there
was
nothing
to
foretell
the
future
nothing
to
be
seen
there
except
five
innocent
boys
and
girls
kneeling
side
by
side
with
their
faces
toward
the
altar
nothing
to
be
heard
but
their
silvery
voices
floating
up
over
the
heads
of
the
congregation
to
the
blue
roof
studded
with
stars
soon
after
that
the
children
were
separated
helga
was
the
first
to
go
the
factor
had
become
rich
and
his
wife
who
had
only
been
waiting
until
she
could
claim
a
separate
maintenance
parted
from
her
husband
and
went
back
to
denmark
taking
their
younger
daughter
with
her
helga
who
was
then
fifteen
years
of
age
was
glad
to
go
but
it
was
a
condition
of
the
separation
that
at
she
should
return
to
iceland
if
her
father
wished
her
to
do
so
or
forfeit
all
interest
in
his
will
little
neils
finsen
was
the
next
to
leave
for
his
father
had
married
again
and
his
stepmother
had
persuaded
the
sheriff
that
the
boy
had
a
genius
for
the
violin
and
ought
to
be
sent
to
london
oscar
remained
a
few
winters
longer
trying
to
find
out
the
profession
he
wished
to
follow
and
deciding
sometimes
in
favor
of
the
law
sometimes
in
favor
of
the
church
but
generally
in
favor
of
music
which
was
vetoed
by
everybody
as
a
beggarly
business
and
being
finally
despatched
to
the
care
of
the
governor
s
college
friend
at
oxford
as
a
first
stage
toward
an
english
degree
and
the
pursuit
of
a
public
career
in
iceland
thus
it
happened
that
within
four
years
of
their
confirmation
only
two
of
the
five
children
were
left
at
home
and
it
had
come
to
pass
that
these
two
magnus
and
thora
were
living
under
the
same
roof
magnus
having
failed
at
the
latin
school
the
hector
had
concluded
that
it
would
be
waste
of
time
to
keep
him
there
any
longer
and
the
governor
had
decided
to
send
him
to
the
farm
when
the
factor
volunteered
to
take
him
as
an
apprentice
in
his
business
and
to
receive
him
into
his
house
the
factor
s
house
was
greatly
changed
by
this
time
the
place
of
his
wife
being
taken
by
his
sister
a
shrewd
little
body
with
a
kindly
heart
but
a
sharp
tongue
which
kept
everybody
in
order
and
reduced
everything
to
rule
under
margret
s
régime
magnus
began
as
one
of
four
apprentices
who
ate
at
the
same
table
with
the
master
and
his
family
but
saw
no
more
of
them
than
they
could
see
at
meals
he
found
it
difficult
to
learn
his
master
s
business
it
was
business
of
barter
in
which
the
farmers
exchanged
their
wool
for
foreign
products
and
settlements
were
made
on
paper
magnus
made
many
blunders
at
the
beginning
and
was
constantly
being
reproved
as
time
went
on
he
grew
to
be
big
and
powerful
and
his
christened
him
jumbo
the
name
stuck
and
he
was
treated
as
a
dullard
except
twice
a
day
at
dinner
and
at
supper
he
saw
nothing
of
thora
now
aunt
margret
sent
her
to
the
girls
high
school
and
if
he
met
her
in
the
street
coming
or
going
she
would
drop
her
head
and
smile
and
then
run
away
magnus
wanted
to
run
too
and
always
in
an
opposite
direction
for
the
secret
of
sex
had
begun
to
whisper
to
both
of
them
once
a
month
in
winter
they
met
at
a
dancing
class
held
at
the
artisans
institute
why
magnus
should
go
there
seeing
he
could
never
learn
to
dance
was
a
mystery
to
everybody
until
one
night
the
truth
became
obvious
to
all
and
then
nobody
thought
him
a
dullard
any
longer
or
dared
to
say
jumbo
beneath
his
breath
a
sprightly
young
sailor
named
hans
thomsen
lately
home
from
a
voyage
was
carrying
himself
with
extraordinary
freedom
he
was
glib
and
nimble
and
partly
for
his
merit
as
a
dancer
but
mainly
for
the
glory
of
having
sailed
he
was
attracting
the
eyes
of
the
girls
seeing
this
he
did
his
best
to
make
sport
for
them
and
when
other
efforts
had
been
exhausted
he
looked
out
for
a
butt
for
his
ridicule
and
seized
upon
magnus
he
called
him
jumbo
several
times
and
when
this
jibe
began
to
fail
he
made
a
doggerel
chorus
which
he
sung
to
a
grotesque
caricature
of
magnus
s
elephantine
steps
slowly
goes
the
cow
in
calf
jog
along
and
do
not
laugh
the
laughter
came
in
peals
yet
magnus
did
not
speak
and
the
girls
thought
he
was
stupid
encouraged
by
his
success
hans
wagered
a
group
of
his
friends
that
he
would
take
his
pick
of
all
the
girls
in
the
room
and
to
prove
his
word
he
strutted
up
to
thora
who
was
reputed
to
be
the
richest
heiress
in
iceland
and
asked
her
to
dance
with
him
but
thora
who
had
flushed
up
at
the
previous
scene
said
quietly
but
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
anger
no
thank
you
and
turning
aside
she
danced
with
magnus
hans
was
at
first
speechless
with
amazement
but
a
man
has
to
be
hungry
to
eat
his
words
in
silence
and
after
a
moment
he
winked
to
his
friends
and
whispered
wait
the
next
dance
was
a
cotillion
and
in
the
first
of
its
figures
a
girl
had
to
sit
blindfold
on
a
chair
placed
at
one
end
of
the
room
while
the
boys
raced
from
the
other
end
to
capture
her
the
one
to
reach
her
first
had
to
lead
her
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
kiss
her
still
blindfold
and
then
dance
her
round
the
room
hans
whispered
to
the
leader
thora
was
chosen
for
the
chair
and
all
the
young
men
present
magnus
excepted
ran
to
catch
her
of
course
hans
was
the
easy
victor
and
taking
possession
of
his
prize
he
led
her
to
the
appointed
place
and
then
while
all
were
silent
and
everybody
waited
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
made
a
mock
obeisance
before
her
blindfolded
face
as
much
as
to
say
he
did
not
wish
to
kiss
her
and
left
her
where
she
stood
at
that
the
girls
began
to
giggle
and
thora
feeling
that
something
was
wrong
uncovered
her
eyes
and
found
herself
standing
alone
and
the
sailor
in
his
seat
then
the
color
rushed
to
her
eyes
again
but
thrice
redder
and
hotter
than
before
and
covered
with
confusion
she
crept
back
to
her
place
a
moment
afterward
hans
was
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
kicking
his
heels
higher
than
a
short
man
s
head
when
magnus
pale
as
a
ghost
stepped
out
and
took
hold
of
him
you
must
dance
with
me
next
he
said
and
the
sailor
feeling
the
grip
of
a
lion
about
his
waist
cried
half
in
earnest
half
in
jest
but
it
s
no
use
dancing
with
a
bull
let
go
of
me
will
you
not
till
i
show
you
how
a
bull
would
dance
you
said
magnus
and
before
any
one
could
know
what
was
about
to
happen
the
sailor
had
kicked
the
beam
of
the
ceiling
filling
the
room
with
dust
and
fallen
with
a
crash
to
the
floor
hans
never
went
to
sea
again
and
the
sheriff
who
was
a
rival
of
the
governor
fined
magnus
a
hundred
crowns
after
reading
him
a
lecture
on
bad
passions
and
the
duty
of
parents
to
check
them
the
factor
paid
the
money
and
then
stopped
it
ten
crowns
a
month
for
ten
months
out
of
magnus
s
salary
the
salary
was
twenty
crowns
in
all
at
that
time
and
magnus
took
the
other
ten
in
secret
to
hans
himself
as
long
as
hans
lived
in
iceland
magnus
paid
him
ten
crowns
a
month
whatever
his
own
earnings
might
be
hans
became
a
and
a
drunkard
after
that
aunt
margret
invited
magnus
to
spend
his
evenings
with
her
and
thora
instead
of
going
upstairs
with
the
other
apprentices
this
led
to
the
happiest
period
in
his
life
thora
played
the
guitar
while
aunt
margret
knitted
interminable
stockings
and
in
order
to
find
an
excuse
for
his
presence
magnus
began
to
learn
the
flute
he
had
no
music
in
his
nature
but
he
continued
to
scream
and
puff
through
his
instrument
like
an
express
train
through
a
ventilated
tunnel
and
when
he
had
blown
himself
out
of
breath
thora
who
was
sweet
and
patient
would
wait
while
he
wiped
his
forehead
those
intervals
in
the
harmony
were
always
the
dearest
part
of
the
evenings
to
magnus
for
then
he
could
talk
to
thora
the
big
silent
fellow
who
rarely
spoke
to
anybody
else
would
sometimes
talk
to
her
with
a
force
and
eloquence
which
made
aunt
margret
s
closing
eyes
wink
and
open
wide
it
was
only
about
business
what
he
had
done
or
was
going
to
do
but
his
face
would
light
up
his
eyes
would
flash
his
tongue
would
flow
and
he
would
become
another
being
as
time
went
on
and
magnus
passed
out
of
his
apprenticeship
he
began
to
develop
great
schemes
and
ideas
and
he
always
tried
them
on
thora
first
the
barter
business
would
go
to
the
dogs
some
day
and
the
fortunes
of
the
future
would
be
made
in
the
fishing
he
was
the
richest
man
in
the
world
whose
estate
was
in
the
sea
and
if
icelanders
had
the
sense
to
see
where
their
wealth
was
waiting
for
them
they
would
build
luggers
to
replace
their
open
boats
and
buy
quick
steamers
to
run
their
fish
to
england
that
required
money
but
parliament
ought
to
provide
it
and
some
day
who
could
know
what
might
not
happen
magnus
himself
would
enter
althing
and
tell
those
talking
automatons
what
they
ought
to
do
the
factor
heard
of
this
project
through
aunt
margret
and
he
was
much
impressed
by
its
foresight
and
practical
wisdom
one
day
after
smoking
various
pipes
while
turning
the
leaves
of
his
ledger
he
went
over
to
the
governor
and
said
upon
my
soul
stephen
that
son
of
yours
is
no
fool
he
has
notions
and
if
he
had
capital
as
well
i
don
t
know
that
something
mightn
t
come
of
him
but
broad
thighs
want
broad
breeches
and
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
lend
the
lad
some
money
and
give
him
a
chance
said
the
governor
and
create
a
rival
to
crush
me
no
no
near
is
my
shirt
but
nearer
is
my
skin
but
look
here
old
friend
why
shouldn
t
magnus
marry
thora
splendid
it
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
to
cement
our
friendship
in
the
second
generation
by
a
still
closer
bond
let
s
come
down
to
facts
and
figures
then
said
the
factor
and
within
half
an
hour
the
marriage
of
magnus
and
thora
was
a
settled
matter
magnus
heard
of
it
from
the
governor
i
ve
been
talking
with
the
factor
about
you
magnus
and
we
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
you
and
thora
made
a
match
he
will
make
you
his
partner
immediately
and
in
due
time
the
heir
to
half
he
leaves
behind
so
if
you
agree
but
thora
magnus
s
eyes
had
lit
up
with
a
deep
glow
of
delight
does
thora
agree
i
must
leave
you
to
find
that
out
for
yourself
said
the
governor
thora
in
her
turn
heard
of
the
arrangement
from
aunt
margret
your
father
is
growing
old
my
precious
and
it
s
time
he
took
a
partner
pity
he
hasn
t
a
son
for
a
place
like
that
but
the
next
best
thing
is
a
and
if
you
or
helga
would
marry
somebody
who
could
carry
on
the
business
somebody
like
magnus
but
magnus
is
like
my
brother
aunt
margret
so
much
the
easier
to
make
him
your
husband
my
honey
but
surely
it
s
necessary
to
love
one
s
husband
auntie
certainly
it
is
necessary
to
love
him
but
that
s
easy
enough
with
magnus
such
an
old
friend
and
so
devoted
to
the
family
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
except
that
magnus
should
speak
to
thora
for
himself
but
that
was
a
task
of
graver
difficulty
the
great
creature
who
had
broken
the
back
of
the
swaggering
bully
began
to
tremble
in
the
mere
presence
of
the
little
lady
who
dropped
her
blue
eyes
whenever
he
entered
the
room
the
music
lasted
longer
of
an
evening
now
and
the
intervals
were
fewer
and
more
brief
but
one
day
magnus
who
had
been
to
thingvellir
on
the
business
of
the
came
back
with
a
young
pony
and
called
thora
into
the
yard
of
her
father
s
house
to
look
at
it
the
colt
which
was
prancing
about
for
sheer
joy
of
being
alive
had
faultless
limbs
a
glossy
chestnut
coat
and
a
silvery
mane
and
tail
is
it
a
good
one
said
magnus
it
s
a
beauty
said
thora
it
s
perfect
it
s
the
loveliest
thing
that
ever
stepped
whomever
does
it
belong
to
it
belongs
to
you
said
magnus
and
when
thora
gave
him
her
hand
to
thank
him
he
held
it
for
a
moment
while
he
looked
into
her
face
and
then
drew
her
to
his
side
and
kissed
her
is
it
to
be
so
thora
he
whispered
and
from
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
his
breast
thora
answered
yes
the
world
was
going
round
him
in
a
wild
dance
of
joy
when
somebody
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
it
was
the
factor
who
had
seen
everything
from
the
house
that
s
the
best
day
s
work
you
ever
did
in
your
life
my
lad
and
i
ll
take
care
you
never
rue
it
but
what
s
this
they
tell
me
that
you
are
at
thingvellir
this
year
that
is
so
said
magnus
well
well
i
m
willing
take
ten
days
at
your
and
while
you
are
away
i
ll
have
the
contract
written
out
and
ready
then
we
ll
sign
it
the
day
after
you
come
back
and
the
wedding
can
be
when
you
please
thora
and
magnus
went
into
the
house
hand
in
hand
like
children
and
aunt
margret
who
had
been
crying
behind
the
kitchen
door
fell
on
them
and
kissed
them
magnus
thought
he
had
never
been
so
happy
in
his
life
and
though
the
sun
had
set
it
shone
for
him
all
night
long
next
day
he
went
back
to
thingvellir
and
scarcely
two
hours
after
he
had
gone
word
ran
through
the
town
that
the
steamer
laura
had
arrived
in
the
fiord
and
his
brother
oscar
had
returned
in
her
oscar
stephenson
carried
everything
before
him
during
the
six
years
of
his
absence
in
england
he
had
grown
as
straight
as
a
poplar
and
as
handsome
as
a
young
god
both
his
dress
and
his
manners
seemed
faultless
in
iceland
eyes
and
each
had
a
touch
of
individuality
that
was
irresistible
his
spirits
were
as
buoyant
and
boyish
as
before
and
his
gaiety
captivated
everybody
it
counted
for
nothing
that
his
career
abroad
had
been
something
like
a
failure
that
his
infirmities
of
character
had
followed
him
that
his
father
had
forbidden
him
to
return
before
in
order
to
fix
him
at
his
studies
that
he
had
left
oxford
nevertheless
without
taking
his
degree
and
that
removing
to
london
at
his
own
earnest
entreaty
he
had
hitherto
done
nothing
at
the
academy
of
music
he
could
and
he
would
was
all
that
anybody
thought
of
this
and
when
he
once
began
he
would
take
the
world
by
storm
on
landing
from
the
steamer
he
ran
up
the
street
as
light
of
foot
as
a
reindeer
shouting
salutations
on
every
side
plunged
into
government
house
hugged
his
mother
at
intervals
for
five
minutes
spoke
so
fast
that
she
could
not
follow
him
dashed
into
the
governor
s
bureau
kissed
his
father
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
was
a
boy
talked
for
ten
minutes
explained
that
he
had
not
written
to
say
that
he
was
coming
because
he
wanted
to
take
everybody
unawares
then
said
now
i
must
slip
off
to
see
my
godfather
and
vanished
like
a
shaft
of
april
sunshine
leaving
the
air
of
the
room
tingling
like
a
candelabra
and
the
old
people
smiling
into
each
other
s
faces
with
delighted
surprise
well
oscar
was
always
a
master
of
surprise
said
the
governor
and
he
took
up
his
hat
and
followed
him
when
oscar
reached
the
factor
s
house
he
came
first
upon
aunt
margret
and
throwing
his
arms
about
her
neck
he
held
her
so
long
that
to
recover
her
breath
and
to
save
her
ringlets
she
had
to
beat
him
off
with
her
fists
and
then
there
stood
thora
in
her
laced
bodice
and
turned
down
collar
her
hufa
and
tassel
and
plaited
hair
looking
sideways
out
of
her
soft
blue
eyes
and
smiling
with
her
rows
of
pure
white
teeth
he
thought
she
was
a
picture
of
charming
simplicity
and
took
both
her
hands
in
both
of
his
and
so
they
stood
for
some
moments
while
she
grew
redder
and
redder
every
instant
and
tried
to
get
away
can
it
be
possible
he
said
and
this
is
thora
when
we
were
children
she
used
to
kiss
me
but
now
now
she
s
going
to
be
married
oscar
haven
t
you
heard
the
news
thora
is
to
be
married
to
magnus
then
she
belongs
to
the
family
and
i
may
kiss
her
in
any
case
said
oscar
thora
escaped
at
last
and
then
the
factor
came
in
and
oscar
had
to
turn
round
and
round
like
a
that
his
godfather
might
see
what
changes
the
world
had
made
in
him
he
laughed
and
laughed
again
inquiring
about
the
business
and
the
crops
and
then
tramped
about
the
house
asking
what
had
become
of
this
piece
of
furniture
and
what
they
had
done
with
that
everything
seems
to
speak
to
me
he
said
and
in
my
den
at
oxford
i
used
to
hear
that
old
bornholme
clock
ticking
away
as
plainly
as
i
hear
it
now
then
the
governor
arrived
and
anna
followed
him
and
while
the
old
men
smoked
and
aunt
margret
did
the
honors
oscar
poured
out
the
foreign
news
in
a
stream
of
galloping
words
and
then
asked
what
was
going
on
at
home
they
told
him
of
magnus
s
ideas
and
schemes
but
he
did
not
approve
them
iceland
will
be
iceland
no
longer
if
you
turn
it
into
a
little
america
he
said
it
is
the
country
of
song
and
story
of
fire
frost
volcano
glacier
and
of
patriarchal
methods
of
government
and
trade
oscar
is
right
said
the
factor
keep
up
the
old
order
i
say
and
when
oscar
had
shot
away
like
a
meteor
the
factor
said
that
young
fellow
has
made
me
feel
fifteen
years
younger
i
must
keep
an
eye
on
magnus
though
he
is
no
fool
but
he
can
t
reach
with
his
hands
where
oscar
has
his
feet
oscar
s
a
boy
he
s
a
darling
said
aunt
margret
straightening
her
ringlets
thora
hardly
knew
what
she
thought
of
him
except
that
he
had
left
her
very
unhappy
when
she
went
to
bed
that
night
she
could
not
help
comparing
magnus
unfavorably
with
his
brother
recalling
little
things
like
his
hands
and
his
nails
and
the
discolored
patches
on
his
cheeks
when
he
neglected
to
shave
next
day
oscar
distributed
the
presents
he
had
brought
from
england
a
brooch
for
anna
containing
a
place
for
his
own
portrait
a
pin
for
aunt
margret
a
silver
belt
for
thora
and
something
for
nearly
everybody
his
unselfishness
was
a
subject
of
general
eulogy
and
nobody
remembered
for
the
moment
that
the
governor
had
paid
for
everything
in
the
afternoon
he
came
again
to
the
factor
s
and
talked
for
an
hour
to
thora
and
aunt
margret
about
london
and
the
glory
of
its
sights
and
scenes
you
must
see
them
for
yourself
some
day
thora
he
said
but
then
i
suppose
old
magnus
will
never
leave
iceland
whatever
happens
thora
was
more
unhappy
than
ever
when
she
went
to
bed
that
second
night
thinking
what
a
difference
it
made
in
a
man
if
he
had
sailed
and
what
a
wondrous
life
the
girl
must
live
who
was
to
marry
oscar
she
was
looking
at
her
new
belt
in
the
glass
and
standing
off
from
it
to
admire
her
glorified
waist
when
silvertop
winnied
in
the
stable
and
then
she
felt
a
little
ashamed
oscar
came
the
next
day
also
and
aunt
margret
being
out
on
an
errand
of
charity
he
sat
with
thora
alone
until
it
was
quite
dark
telling
of
the
plays
he
had
seen
in
england
there
was
a
good
deal
about
love
in
them
and
one
was
of
a
girl
beloved
by
two
brothers
her
father
had
married
her
to
the
elder
brother
while
she
was
still
a
child
but
as
soon
as
her
heart
awoke
she
loved
the
younger
one
and
her
husband
killed
both
of
them
thora
cried
for
the
two
children
who
tried
to
be
true
but
could
not
and
she
dreamt
that
night
that
she
was
francesca
and
oscar
was
paolo
and
magnus
was
giovanni
the
dream
was
painful
but
the
awakening
was
more
painful
still
oscar
came
the
next
day
also
and
then
he
played
a
number
of
songs
he
had
composed
on
subjects
in
the
sagas
thora
thought
she
had
never
heard
such
playing
and
do
what
she
would
she
could
not
help
laughing
a
little
at
the
thought
of
magnus
s
performances
on
the
flute
i
m
sure
he
ll
become
a
great
composer
she
said
when
oscar
had
gone
perhaps
so
but
no
one
can
feed
on
honor
said
aunt
margret
by
this
time
thora
had
begun
to
look
for
oscar
every
day
and
the
next
time
he
came
he
persuaded
her
to
fetch
out
her
guitar
she
played
some
iceland
love
songs
and
sang
them
in
a
sweet
voice
thora
was
like
a
flower
that
had
grown
under
the
snow
and
was
opening
its
eyes
to
the
sun
i
wonder
whom
oscar
will
marry
she
said
and
aunt
margret
answered
some
english
miss
with
plenty
of
this
world
s
goods
and
none
of
the
next
and
then
thora
felt
a
tingling
pain
in
her
breast
one
day
there
came
a
note
from
oscar
saying
glorious
morning
what
do
you
say
to
a
few
hours
on
the
fiord
will
call
for
you
immediately
they
took
a
boat
belonging
to
the
factor
and
turned
her
head
toward
engey
an
island
inhabited
by
ten
thousand
eider
duck
both
were
rowing
when
they
left
the
jetty
and
the
water
foamed
under
their
oars
but
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
and
hearing
they
dipped
softly
and
drifted
the
sea
and
sky
were
blue
and
quiet
like
two
mirrors
face
to
face
each
reflecting
the
other
and
with
the
boat
like
a
great
bumble
bee
humming
between
oscar
was
like
a
boy
he
laughed
and
talked
continually
telling
stories
of
what
they
used
to
do
when
they
were
children
he
was
not
very
chivalrous
then
he
remembered
but
when
she
pleaded
pitifully
he
used
to
allow
her
to
sit
on
his
sledge
and
they
went
cracking
and
crashing
through
the
crisp
snow
they
had
tiffs
too
in
those
days
and
people
used
to
say
children
who
make
a
quarrel
often
live
to
make
a
match
wise
folks
were
they
not
they
landed
on
engey
and
rambled
about
in
search
of
the
eider
duck
but
all
the
birds
were
gone
and
there
was
nothing
left
in
their
empty
nests
but
a
few
discolored
eggs
and
these
were
addled
we
ve
come
too
late
said
oscar
haven
t
we
come
here
too
late
thora
he
said
again
stooping
to
look
sideways
into
her
face
and
then
thora
who
had
been
humming
a
tune
suddenly
flushed
as
red
as
fire
their
eyes
were
sparkling
and
they
were
quivering
with
excitement
how
i
wish
we
could
be
children
again
said
oscar
don
t
you
thora
before
she
was
aware
thora
answered
yes
and
then
becoming
embarrassed
she
turned
back
toward
the
boat
the
ground
was
scored
with
narrow
ruts
which
had
been
riven
out
of
the
grass
by
the
frosts
of
winter
and
oscar
said
we
can
t
both
walk
in
one
rut
you
know
you
can
catch
me
then
said
thora
and
she
ran
away
laughing
oscar
ran
after
her
and
caught
her
and
held
her
by
the
belt
and
then
she
became
serious
after
a
moment
she
covered
her
face
and
began
to
cry
have
i
hurt
you
asked
oscar
no
no
it
s
nothing
i
m
silly
catch
me
again
said
thora
and
snatching
his
cap
off
his
head
she
flew
over
the
ruts
and
had
leapt
back
into
the
boat
before
he
came
up
with
her
when
they
returned
to
the
factor
s
aunt
margret
who
looked
cool
and
thoughtful
gave
oscar
a
letter
which
his
mother
had
left
for
him
it
was
from
magnus
and
it
ran
dear
oscar
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
have
come
home
and
i
wish
i
had
been
there
to
welcome
you
you
come
in
a
good
hour
for
you
must
have
heard
of
my
good
fortune
about
thora
it
was
long
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
grasp
my
happiness
because
she
was
such
a
happy
little
girl
and
it
seemed
selfish
to
take
her
from
her
father
s
house
and
everybody
there
so
fond
of
her
but
now
that
i
have
got
her
i
feel
new
strength
and
am
doing
the
work
of
three
i
am
so
happy
that
nothing
goes
wrong
with
me
and
i
am
like
the
anvil
that
could
not
be
made
angry
though
it
were
to
have
the
heaviest
blow
but
i
am
longing
to
see
you
and
i
write
to
ask
if
you
will
come
to
the
and
bring
thora
with
you
now
i
must
conclude
for
we
are
camping
in
the
mountains
and
it
will
take
this
letter
all
its
work
to
reach
you
in
your
affectionate
brother
magnus
stephenson
oscar
read
the
letter
aloud
and
when
he
had
finished
it
thora
could
not
see
him
distinctly
for
the
vapor
which
floated
before
her
eyes
like
the
chilling
that
comes
down
the
valley
on
a
bright
winter
s
day
and
hides
the
shining
fells
but
after
a
moment
oscar
laughed
a
little
nervously
and
said
let
us
go
by
all
means
i
ll
have
silvertop
ready
and
bring
him
round
at
five
in
the
morning
next
day
magnus
awoke
on
the
mountains
in
the
paling
light
of
the
moon
and
the
early
glimmering
of
the
dawn
and
thought
of
thora
he
always
thought
of
thora
first
on
waking
in
the
morning
and
her
face
was
the
last
he
saw
at
night
when
he
closed
his
eyes
under
the
stars
seven
days
before
when
he
had
set
his
face
toward
the
fells
with
his
forty
shepherds
and
eighty
ponies
he
had
found
it
hard
to
turn
his
back
on
the
lowlands
because
thora
was
there
but
when
by
daybreak
the
following
morning
they
reached
the
ridge
of
the
mountains
which
divides
the
north
district
from
the
south
and
in
the
grey
light
and
the
running
mist
they
met
the
shepherds
who
had
come
up
from
the
other
side
and
hailed
and
saluted
them
and
exchanged
snuff
and
drank
healths
with
them
and
then
turned
about
and
parted
and
begun
to
descend
the
way
they
came
his
spirits
rose
rapidly
because
every
step
was
taking
him
back
to
thora
five
days
thereafter
magnus
and
his
men
scoured
the
mountains
gathering
up
the
sheep
that
had
strayed
during
the
summer
and
every
night
when
they
pitched
their
tents
in
some
sheltered
place
where
there
was
water
and
grass
among
the
lava
and
screes
and
every
morning
when
they
rose
at
the
first
glimpse
of
daylight
he
told
himself
he
was
one
day
and
one
night
nearer
to
thora
when
he
was
midway
down
some
one
had
brought
him
news
of
oscar
s
return
to
iceland
and
after
he
had
written
his
letter
and
despatched
it
he
was
happy
in
the
prospect
of
seeing
his
young
brother
after
a
long
separation
but
happier
still
in
the
thought
of
seeing
thora
one
day
sooner
than
he
had
expected
because
oscar
would
bring
her
to
meet
him
and
now
it
was
the
last
day
of
his
duty
and
as
he
and
his
shepherds
came
down
the
mountains
driving
five
thousand
head
of
sheep
before
them
and
the
men
began
to
talk
of
their
wives
and
sweethearts
he
thought
surely
nobody
had
ever
loved
anybody
as
he
loved
thora
because
there
was
only
one
thora
in
the
world
the
morning
was
bright
and
calm
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
clear
air
except
the
bleating
of
sheep
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
voices
of
shepherds
calling
to
each
other
as
they
raced
across
the
fells
to
keep
their
flocks
together
but
magnus
felt
as
if
everything
on
earth
and
in
heaven
were
talking
to
him
of
thora
he
began
to
think
of
how
they
should
meet
and
he
found
it
delightful
to
imagine
what
would
happen
oscar
would
say
have
i
brought
her
safely
magnus
and
then
with
one
arm
about
thora
he
would
give
his
other
hand
to
young
oscar
and
thank
him
for
taking
such
good
care
of
the
sweet
girl
who
was
more
to
him
than
his
own
soul
at
eight
o
clock
they
came
in
sight
of
the
they
were
going
to
lying
in
the
valley
like
an
inverted
honeycomb
and
then
magnus
persuaded
himself
he
could
see
through
his
a
line
of
people
like
a
train
of
ants
coming
over
the
plain
beyond
he
could
hardly
contain
himself
at
the
thought
that
thora
must
be
among
them
and
when
an
hour
afterward
he
could
plainly
distinguish
two
riders
galloping
ahead
he
was
happy
in
the
certainty
that
these
were
oscar
and
thora
and
that
they
were
hurrying
to
meet
him
by
ten
o
clock
magnus
and
his
company
had
reached
the
and
there
the
farmers
of
the
district
were
gathered
to
greet
them
with
snuff
and
as
before
but
above
the
joy
of
that
meeting
was
the
delight
of
seeing
a
long
cavalcade
of
the
townspeople
who
had
come
to
make
holiday
and
were
riding
rapidly
up
the
valley
half
an
hour
later
magnus
saw
oscar
and
thora
on
the
outside
of
the
but
at
that
moment
he
was
in
a
palpitating
and
bleating
sea
of
sheep
and
he
could
only
wave
his
hand
and
try
to
shout
his
salutations
he
found
he
could
not
shout
for
something
had
gripped
him
by
the
throat
but
oscar
called
to
him
and
he
thought
what
a
man
he
is
now
and
what
a
voice
he
has
got
during
the
next
three
hours
magnus
was
kept
busy
separating
the
sheep
and
settling
deputes
among
the
farmers
but
as
he
worked
he
saw
the
townspeople
pitch
their
tents
and
light
fires
to
boil
their
kettles
thora
is
there
he
thought
and
he
was
content
by
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
last
of
the
sheep
had
been
separated
the
shepherds
were
driving
away
their
flocks
in
different
directions
the
bleating
barking
and
shouting
were
dying
off
in
the
distance
and
then
magnus
soiled
sunburnt
and
unshaven
turned
his
face
toward
the
tents
the
townspeople
had
finished
eating
their
fires
were
smouldering
out
in
the
sunshine
and
they
were
dancing
to
a
guitar
on
a
level
piece
of
green
when
magnus
went
up
to
them
and
asked
for
oscar
but
looked
for
thora
somebody
told
him
they
had
gone
gone
for
a
walk
somewhere
and
magnus
was
glad
because
they
could
meet
where
they
would
be
more
alone
he
shaded
his
eyes
and
looked
down
the
valley
and
thinking
he
saw
two
figures
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
he
leapt
on
the
back
of
a
pony
that
was
grazing
near
and
rode
off
in
that
direction
he
was
humming
a
tune
for
he
was
very
happy
after
some
minutes
he
was
sure
he
saw
oscar
and
thora
and
began
to
call
to
them
helloa
he
cried
but
there
came
no
answer
helloa
he
cried
again
but
still
there
was
no
reply
and
all
was
silent
now
save
for
the
tinkling
of
the
guitar
behind
him
helloa
helloa
helloa
but
nothing
came
back
to
him
but
his
own
voice
as
it
echoed
in
the
hills
oscar
and
thora
were
sitting
on
the
sunny
side
of
a
rock
which
rose
out
of
the
foot
of
the
mountain
like
a
mound
of
black
soil
but
was
really
the
mouth
of
an
extinct
volcano
magnus
thought
he
knew
what
they
were
doing
they
were
dropping
stones
down
the
crater
and
listening
for
the
sound
of
their
descent
that
was
why
they
had
not
heard
him
although
he
had
called
so
loud
very
well
he
knew
what
he
would
do
he
would
play
a
practical
joke
upon
them
he
would
take
them
by
surprise
he
would
creep
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
rock
and
suddenly
appear
before
them
as
if
he
had
risen
out
of
the
pit
with
this
intention
magnus
made
a
circuit
of
the
crater
and
drew
up
on
the
shady
side
of
it
he
was
then
very
close
to
the
two
who
were
sitting
above
but
still
they
did
not
hear
him
so
slipping
from
the
saddle
and
throwing
the
reins
over
the
pony
s
head
he
stole
up
softly
and
began
to
climb
the
rock
as
quietly
as
he
could
in
his
big
boots
over
the
rolling
stones
the
greater
difficulty
was
to
keep
himself
from
laughing
aloud
at
the
thought
of
what
their
faces
would
be
like
when
he
stood
up
between
them
like
a
ghost
that
had
sprung
out
of
the
earth
scrambling
on
hands
and
knees
magnus
had
climbed
half
way
up
the
rock
when
he
heard
oscar
speaking
and
he
stopped
to
listen
but
why
did
you
consent
said
oscar
s
voice
thora
did
not
answer
and
after
a
moment
the
voice
of
oscar
said
again
why
did
you
thora
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
indistinguishable
words
and
then
the
voice
of
oscar
said
because
your
father
wished
it
but
surely
you
have
to
live
your
own
life
thora
however
obedient
a
daughter
should
be
to
her
father
she
is
a
separate
being
and
the
time
comes
when
she
has
to
fly
with
her
own
wings
as
we
say
then
why
did
you
consent
magnus
felt
his
fingers
tighten
their
hold
on
the
rock
he
was
clinging
to
and
he
leaned
forward
to
catch
thora
s
reply
but
there
was
only
the
same
low
murmur
of
indistinguishable
words
and
then
oscar
s
voice
once
more
magnus
no
doubt
i
wouldn
t
say
a
word
against
magnus
god
forbid
but
love
mutual
love
is
the
only
basis
of
a
true
marriage
and
if
you
do
not
love
magnus
not
really
and
truly
as
you
say
why
did
you
consent
to
marry
him
magnus
felt
the
ground
to
be
reeling
under
his
knees
if
he
had
not
been
clinging
to
the
rock
he
must
have
rolled
to
the
foot
of
it
all
his
soul
seemed
to
listen
but
he
could
hear
nothing
except
the
sound
of
thora
s
voice
breaking
with
sobs
then
came
oscar
s
voice
again
but
lower
and
tenderer
than
before
how
hateful
of
me
to
make
you
cry
thora
i
didn
t
intend
to
do
that
dear
but
have
you
never
asked
yourself
what
will
happen
if
you
marry
magnus
and
then
find
out
when
it
is
too
late
that
you
like
somebody
else
at
that
there
came
another
note
into
thora
s
weeping
a
note
of
joy
as
well
as
sorrow
and
magnus
though
he
did
not
know
it
clambered
higher
up
the
rock
what
did
you
say
thora
tell
me
dear
tell
me
did
you
say
you
had
found
out
already
and
then
at
last
came
thora
s
voice
in
a
burst
of
passionate
tears
you
know
i
have
oscar
and
after
that
there
was
a
startled
cry
thora
had
risen
and
was
moving
toward
oscar
who
was
already
on
his
feet
and
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
when
behind
him
she
saw
magnus
with
a
terrible
face
eyes
staring
lips
parted
and
breath
coming
and
going
in
gusts
oscar
turned
to
see
what
it
was
that
thora
looked
at
and
seeing
magnus
his
whole
body
seemed
to
shrink
in
an
instant
and
he
felt
like
a
little
man
is
it
you
really
he
faltered
and
he
smiled
a
sickly
smile
but
magnus
neither
saw
nor
heard
him
magnus
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
and
knew
nothing
at
that
first
moment
except
that
he
a
man
of
awful
strength
and
passion
was
standing
at
the
mouth
of
a
pit
as
deep
as
hell
and
as
silent
as
the
grave
with
two
who
had
been
dearer
to
him
than
any
others
in
the
world
and
they
had
deceived
and
betrayed
him
but
at
the
next
moment
he
saw
a
look
in
thora
s
face
that
made
him
remember
hans
the
sailor
for
it
was
the
same
look
that
he
had
seen
there
the
instant
after
he
had
thrown
the
man
on
his
back
and
then
a
ghostly
hand
seemed
to
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
and
the
fearful
impulse
passed
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
in
which
nothing
was
heard
but
the
quick
breathing
of
the
three
and
then
magnus
found
his
voice
a
choking
utterance
and
he
fell
on
thora
with
loud
reproaches
what
does
this
mean
he
said
it
is
only
six
days
since
i
parted
from
you
and
now
i
find
you
like
this
speak
can
t
you
speak
but
thora
could
only
gasp
and
moan
and
oscar
who
had
struggled
to
recover
himself
stepped
out
to
defend
her
it
s
not
thora
s
fault
magnus
it
s
mine
if
it
is
anybody
s
and
if
you
have
anything
to
say
you
must
speak
to
me
you
cried
magnus
wheeling
round
on
him
what
are
you
i
d
like
to
know
a
man
who
betrays
his
own
brother
is
that
what
you
came
home
to
do
to
make
mischief
and
strife
and
break
up
everything
in
the
name
of
god
why
didn
t
you
stay
where
you
came
from
magnus
said
oscar
trying
to
hold
himself
in
you
must
not
speak
to
me
like
that
you
must
not
talk
as
if
i
had
stolen
thora
s
affections
away
from
you
because
then
what
have
you
done
if
you
haven
t
done
that
what
have
you
done
because
thora
never
loved
you
never
though
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
very
sorry
damn
your
sorry
said
magnus
and
damn
your
insolence
cried
oscar
and
if
you
won
t
hear
the
truth
in
sorrow
then
hear
it
in
scorn
thora
s
engagement
to
you
is
nothing
but
a
miserable
commercial
bargain
between
her
father
and
our
father
by
which
she
has
been
bought
and
sold
like
a
slave
the
blow
went
home
magnus
felt
the
truth
of
it
he
tried
to
speak
and
at
first
he
could
not
do
so
at
length
he
stammered
i
know
nothing
about
that
i
only
know
that
i
was
to
marry
thora
and
that
in
two
days
time
we
were
to
be
betrothed
then
thora
said
nervously
with
quivering
lips
and
voice
it
wasn
t
altogether
my
fault
magnus
you
know
it
was
not
it
was
all
done
by
other
people
and
i
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
matter
i
was
never
asked
never
consulted
but
i
asked
you
myself
thora
that
was
when
everything
had
been
settled
and
arranged
magnus
but
if
you
had
told
me
even
then
thora
if
you
had
told
me
that
you
did
not
wish
it
that
you
could
not
care
for
me
i
didn
t
know
at
that
time
magnus
you
didn
t
know
thora
i
didn
t
know
that
the
love
i
felt
for
you
was
not
the
right
love
that
there
was
another
kind
of
love
altogether
and
that
before
a
girl
should
bind
herself
to
any
one
for
better
or
worse
until
death
parts
them
she
ought
to
love
him
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
and
strength
and
do
you
know
that
kind
of
love
now
thora
asked
magnus
and
thora
faltered
yes
that
word
was
like
a
to
magnus
he
stared
blankly
before
him
and
muttered
beneath
his
breath
my
god
my
god
and
then
thora
broke
down
utterly
no
one
spoke
for
some
moments
magnus
was
going
through
a
terrible
struggle
he
was
telling
himself
that
after
all
these
two
had
something
to
say
for
themselves
they
had
their
excuse
their
justification
they
loved
each
other
and
perhaps
they
could
not
avoid
doing
what
they
had
done
while
he
he
who
had
thought
himself
the
injured
person
was
really
the
one
who
was
in
the
way
when
thora
s
weeping
ceased
magnus
looked
up
and
said
in
a
voice
that
was
pitifully
hoarse
and
husky
so
it
s
all
over
it
seems
and
there
s
no
help
for
it
no
one
spoke
and
magnus
said
again
well
a
man
s
heart
does
not
break
i
suppose
so
i
daresay
i
shall
get
over
it
still
the
others
said
nothing
and
magnus
looked
from
oscar
to
thora
and
said
quite
simply
but
what
is
to
be
done
if
it
is
all
over
between
thora
and
me
what
is
to
be
done
now
neither
of
them
answered
him
so
he
turned
to
thora
and
said
your
father
was
to
have
the
contract
ready
by
the
time
of
our
return
can
you
ask
him
to
destroy
it
she
did
not
reply
you
can
t
i
know
you
can
t
your
father
would
never
forgive
you
never
then
he
turned
to
oscar
the
governor
has
plans
about
the
partnership
can
you
fulfil
them
if
i
should
fail
no
is
it
impossible
oscar
gave
no
sign
and
after
a
moment
magnus
said
then
i
must
be
the
first
to
move
i
suppose
but
perhaps
that
is
only
right
since
i
am
the
one
who
has
to
get
out
of
the
way
don
t
say
that
magnus
cried
thora
why
not
better
a
sour
truth
than
a
sweet
lie
thora
thora
dropped
her
eyes
oscar
turned
aside
they
heard
magnus
s
foot
on
the
stones
as
if
he
were
moving
away
but
they
dared
not
look
lest
they
should
see
his
face
after
a
moment
he
stopped
and
spoke
again
when
i
was
coming
down
the
mountain
i
thought
we
might
go
home
together
all
three
together
but
perhaps
we
had
better
not
besides
if
i
have
to
move
first
in
that
matter
i
have
my
work
cut
out
for
me
and
i
must
be
alone
to
think
of
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
oscar
god
knows
said
magnus
he
has
got
us
into
a
knot
he
must
get
us
out
of
it
they
heard
his
heavy
boots
on
the
sliding
stones
as
he
stepped
down
the
rock
they
heard
him
speak
cheerfully
to
his
pony
as
he
swung
to
the
saddle
they
heard
the
crack
of
his
long
reins
as
he
slashed
them
above
the
pony
s
head
and
then
as
well
as
they
could
for
the
tears
that
were
blinding
them
they
saw
him
bent
double
and
flying
across
the
plain
early
next
day
magnus
called
at
government
house
and
went
up
to
oscar
s
room
he
found
oscar
sitting
at
a
desk
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
before
him
and
sundry
torn
scraps
lying
about
as
if
he
had
been
trying
in
vain
to
write
a
letter
the
brothers
greeted
each
other
with
constraint
and
during
the
greater
part
of
their
interview
neither
of
them
looked
into
the
other
s
face
i
have
come
to
tell
you
said
magnus
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
desk
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
carpet
at
his
feet
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
see
a
way
i
think
i
see
a
way
out
of
our
difficulty
what
is
it
asked
oscar
looking
steadfastly
at
the
blank
sheet
of
paper
before
him
it
is
a
plan
which
does
not
involve
thora
at
all
or
in
any
way
reflect
upon
you
therefore
you
need
not
ask
me
what
it
is
i
expect
to
try
it
and
if
it
succeeds
the
consequences
will
be
mine
mine
only
and
nobody
else
will
be
blamed
or
affected
oscar
bowed
his
head
over
the
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
said
nothing
but
before
i
take
the
step
i
am
thinking
of
i
want
to
be
sure
it
will
be
worth
taking
and
have
the
results
i
expect
that
s
why
i
am
here
now
i
am
here
to
ask
you
certain
questions
what
are
they
said
oscar
they
are
very
intimate
and
personal
questions
but
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
ask
them
seeing
what
i
intend
to
do
said
magnus
and
then
in
a
firmer
voice
and
a
right
to
have
them
answered
also
ask
them
said
oscar
i
want
to
know
first
whether
if
i
can
liberate
thora
from
her
promise
to
me
you
will
marry
her
indeed
yes
if
she
will
have
me
yes
you
said
yesterday
you
remember
that
love
mutual
love
was
the
only
basis
of
a
true
marriage
perhaps
i
forgot
that
in
my
own
case
but
i
must
not
forget
it
now
so
it
is
not
sufficient
that
thora
should
love
you
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
love
thora
you
do
love
her
indeed
i
do
your
attachment
is
a
brief
one
are
you
sure
it
is
not
a
passing
fancy
quite
sure
it
is
a
solemn
thing
that
two
human
beings
should
bind
themselves
together
as
thora
said
for
better
or
worse
until
death
parts
them
you
are
not
afraid
of
that
no
you
will
always
love
her
always
said
oscar
you
have
counted
the
cost
all
the
consequences
i
know
nothing
of
costs
and
consequences
magnus
i
only
know
that
i
love
thora
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
that
if
you
will
liberate
her
and
she
will
consent
to
marry
me
i
will
consecrate
my
whole
life
to
make
her
happy
magnus
shifted
in
his
seat
cleared
his
throat
and
began
again
thora
is
a
sweet
good
girl
he
said
the
best
and
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
but
she
is
a
simple
iceland
maiden
who
has
never
been
out
of
her
own
country
she
is
not
like
you
and
if
you
take
her
to
england
she
will
not
be
like
your
friends
there
have
you
thought
of
that
are
you
ready
to
make
allowances
for
her
upbringing
and
education
will
your
love
bear
all
the
strain
of
such
a
marriage
it
was
now
oscar
s
turn
to
move
restlessly
in
his
seat
why
should
you
ask
me
a
question
like
that
magnus
will
it
repeated
magnus
more
firmly
i
certainly
think
it
will
but
will
it
said
magnus
still
more
firmly
it
will
said
oscar
there
was
a
short
pause
and
then
magnus
said
quietly
there
are
two
or
three
other
questions
i
wish
to
ask
of
you
and
i
ask
them
for
your
sake
as
much
as
thora
s
go
on
said
oscar
thora
is
practically
her
father
s
only
daughter
now
and
he
is
old
and
very
fond
of
her
if
he
should
wish
her
to
remain
in
iceland
after
her
marriage
you
would
be
willing
to
live
here
for
the
rest
of
your
life
if
he
made
it
a
condition
yes
naturally
the
governor
has
certain
plans
for
you
having
spent
so
much
on
your
education
and
you
have
your
own
aims
and
ambitions
also
but
if
these
should
clash
with
your
love
for
thora
if
they
should
tempt
you
away
from
her
you
would
be
ready
to
give
them
up
certainly
i
would
you
are
sure
of
that
i
am
sure
of
it
that
is
to
say
it
would
be
hard
no
doubt
to
abandon
the
aims
and
ambitions
of
one
s
whole
life
but
if
they
ever
clashed
as
you
say
with
my
love
for
thora
ever
tempted
me
away
from
her
tempted
me
to
leave
her
to
go
to
england
for
example
or
to
any
other
country
or
any
other
woman
that
is
not
possible
magnus
but
if
it
were
possible
i
would
not
go
said
oscar
so
that
if
i
give
thora
up
and
she
consents
to
marry
you
nothing
and
nobody
will
be
allowed
to
disturb
her
happiness
nothing
and
nobody
said
oscar
then
write
that
said
magnus
tapping
the
paper
on
the
desk
write
it
to
her
not
to
me
if
you
are
sure
of
all
this
you
can
not
be
afraid
to
put
it
in
black
and
white
i
m
not
afraid
but
it
s
of
no
use
writing
it
to
thora
why
not
because
when
you
left
us
yesterday
she
told
me
that
though
her
heart
was
mine
she
had
given
her
word
to
you
and
she
would
be
compelled
to
keep
it
she
told
you
that
she
did
magnus
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
the
husky
voice
of
yesterday
write
it
nevertheless
and
let
me
take
the
letter
you
mean
that
magnus
yes
that
you
will
give
her
back
her
word
and
speak
to
her
for
me
write
your
letter
said
magnus
huskily
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
had
behaved
odiously
and
wish
to
heaven
i
had
never
come
back
from
england
i
can
not
wish
that
though
for
thora
s
love
is
everything
on
earth
to
me
now
and
i
would
do
anything
to
hold
on
to
it
but
if
i
have
done
wrong
to
you
i
know
of
no
better
way
of
expressing
my
regret
than
by
placing
my
dearest
interests
in
your
hands
i
will
write
the
letter
at
once
magnus
i
tried
to
write
it
twenty
times
and
couldn
t
but
now
i
can
and
i
will
while
oscar
s
pen
flew
over
the
blank
sheet
of
paper
magnus
sat
with
head
down
digging
at
the
pattern
in
the
carpet
a
fierce
fight
was
going
on
in
his
heart
even
yet
for
the
devil
seemed
to
be
whispering
in
his
ear
what
are
you
doing
didn
t
you
hear
what
he
said
that
thora
had
decided
to
keep
her
word
to
you
are
you
going
to
persuade
her
not
to
do
so
you
ll
never
get
over
it
never
when
oscar
had
finished
his
letter
he
gave
it
to
magnus
and
said
here
it
is
i
think
it
says
all
we
talked
about
if
less
than
a
fraction
of
what
i
feel
she
ll
listen
to
you
though
i
feel
sure
of
that
but
if
she
does
not
if
she
sends
me
the
same
answer
what
will
you
do
then
asked
magnus
pausing
at
the
door
then
i
will
take
the
first
steamer
back
to
england
and
ask
you
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
of
what
has
happened
a
bright
light
came
into
magnus
s
face
and
then
slowly
died
away
but
i
can
not
think
of
that
yet
magnus
not
till
i
hear
the
result
of
your
errand
see
her
speak
to
her
tell
her
she
is
not
responsible
for
her
father
s
contract
beg
of
her
not
to
ruin
her
own
life
and
mine
will
you
i
will
god
bless
you
old
fellow
you
are
the
best
brother
a
man
ever
had
don
t
be
too
long
away
i
shall
hardly
live
until
you
return
put
me
out
of
suspense
as
quickly
as
you
can
magnus
if
you
only
knew
how
awfully
i
love
the
little
girl
and
how
much
her
answer
means
to
me
but
magnus
s
tortured
face
had
disappeared
behind
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
his
mother
met
him
and
she
said
so
you
ve
been
up
with
oscar
all
the
time
your
father
and
the
factor
were
looking
for
you
everywhere
they
had
the
lawyers
with
them
all
the
morning
and
wanted
to
consult
you
about
something
it
s
settled
now
i
think
so
there
s
no
need
to
trouble
but
goodness
gracious
magnus
how
white
and
worn
you
look
that
work
on
the
mountains
hasn
t
suited
you
and
you
must
do
no
more
of
it
magnus
excused
himself
to
anna
and
hastened
away
to
the
factor
s
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
with
oscar
s
letter
to
thora
in
his
side
pocket
and
his
nervous
fingers
clutching
it
the
devilish
voice
that
had
tempted
him
before
seemed
to
speak
to
him
again
and
say
destroy
it
didn
t
you
hear
him
say
that
he
would
go
away
let
him
go
nobody
but
yourself
will
know
anything
about
the
letter
even
thora
will
never
know
and
when
oscar
is
gone
thora
will
fulfil
her
promise
to
you
let
her
fulfil
it
if
she
does
not
love
you
now
she
will
come
to
love
you
later
on
and
if
she
never
comes
to
love
you
she
will
be
yours
you
will
have
her
and
who
has
a
better
right
destroy
it
destroy
it
but
his
good
angel
seemed
to
answer
and
say
what
s
the
use
of
having
a
woman
s
body
if
you
can
not
have
her
soul
that
s
lust
not
love
and
it
s
too
late
to
think
of
it
anyway
the
question
you
have
to
decide
is
simple
enough
do
you
love
yourself
better
than
you
love
thora
or
thora
better
than
yourself
and
then
the
devil
seemed
to
whisper
again
and
say
what
a
fool
s
errand
you
are
going
upon
if
you
win
you
lose
if
you
lose
you
win
if
you
persuade
thora
to
preserve
her
own
happiness
you
destroy
your
own
if
you
do
not
persuade
her
to
marry
oscar
she
will
marry
you
are
you
a
man
is
there
an
ounce
of
hot
blood
in
you
the
fight
was
fierce
but
magnus
decided
in
favor
of
the
girl
s
happiness
against
his
own
and
he
said
to
himself
at
every
step
go
on
you
want
thora
to
be
happy
then
carry
it
through
it
is
hard
but
go
on
go
on
when
he
reached
the
factor
s
his
great
limbs
could
hardly
support
themselves
and
his
ashen
face
was
covered
with
sweat
the
factor
s
house
was
full
of
the
sweet
smell
of
the
baking
of
cakes
and
thora
and
aunt
margret
were
in
the
kitchen
with
the
fronts
of
their
gowns
tucked
up
to
their
waists
their
sleeves
turned
back
and
in
their
hands
behind
a
table
laden
with
soft
dough
and
sprinkled
with
flour
here
s
magnus
at
last
said
aunt
margret
and
perhaps
he
can
tell
me
how
it
happened
that
you
came
home
without
him
yesterday
magnus
did
his
best
to
laugh
it
off
that
s
a
long
story
auntie
he
said
a
horse
s
shoe
isn
t
made
at
a
blow
and
i
want
to
speak
to
thora
mind
you
don
t
keep
her
long
then
if
we
re
to
be
ready
for
all
the
people
who
are
coming
there
s
work
here
for
a
baker
s
dozen
magnus
went
up
to
the
little
with
the
barnholme
clock
in
it
and
thora
followed
there
were
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
and
her
manner
was
nervous
and
restless
i
am
ashamed
of
what
happened
yesterday
she
said
and
i
ask
you
to
forgive
and
forget
i
can
not
do
either
said
magnus
that
is
to
say
not
yet
and
in
the
way
you
mean
thora
s
eyes
began
to
fill
don
t
be
too
hard
on
me
magnus
i
m
trying
to
make
amends
and
it
isn
t
very
easy
i
m
not
so
hard
on
you
as
you
are
on
yourself
thora
and
i
m
here
to
tell
you
not
to
do
yourself
an
injustice
thora
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
if
you
mean
that
you
have
come
to
say
that
after
all
i
must
fulfil
my
promise
it
is
unnecessary
because
i
intend
to
do
so
will
that
be
right
thora
it
may
not
be
right
to
oscar
perhaps
or
to
myself
i
m
not
thinking
about
oscar
now
and
i
m
not
thinking
about
you
i
m
thinking
about
myself
will
it
be
right
to
me
what
more
can
i
do
magnus
it
wasn
t
altogether
my
fault
that
i
gave
you
my
word
but
i
did
give
it
and
i
am
trying
to
keep
it
would
it
be
right
to
marry
me
seeing
as
you
said
yourself
you
do
not
care
for
me
thora
dropped
her
head
you
said
yesterday
that
before
a
girl
should
marry
a
man
she
ought
to
love
him
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
and
strength
wouldn
t
it
be
wrong
to
marry
me
while
you
loved
somebody
else
like
that
is
that
what
you
call
making
amends
thora
i
was
only
trying
to
do
what
was
right
magnus
but
if
you
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
marry
you
then
i
will
never
marry
at
all
never
what
good
will
that
be
to
me
thora
five
years
ten
years
twenty
years
hence
what
good
will
it
be
to
me
that
because
you
had
given
me
your
word
and
could
not
keep
it
you
are
living
a
lonely
life
somewhere
thora
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
what
sort
of
a
poor
whisp
of
a
man
do
you
suppose
i
am
thora
i
didn
t
intend
to
insult
you
magnus
but
if
i
can
neither
marry
you
nor
remain
unmarried
what
am
i
to
do
you
know
quite
well
what
you
are
to
do
thora
thora
uncovered
her
face
her
eyes
were
shining
you
mean
that
i
must
marry
oscar
that
depends
upon
whether
you
love
him
the
shining
eyes
were
very
bright
in
spite
of
the
tears
that
swam
in
them
do
you
love
him
don
t
ask
me
that
magnus
but
i
do
ask
you
thora
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
do
you
love
oscar
i
admire
and
esteem
him
magnus
but
do
you
love
him
everybody
loves
oscar
do
you
love
him
thora
yes
said
thora
softly
and
for
some
moments
after
that
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
the
ticking
of
the
clock
then
as
he
loves
you
and
wishes
to
marry
you
it
is
your
duty
to
marry
him
said
magnus
but
i
have
given
my
word
to
you
magnus
i
give
you
back
your
word
thora
the
shining
eyes
were
shedding
tears
of
joy
by
this
time
but
while
love
fought
for
oscar
duty
and
honor
struggled
for
magnus
but
i
have
told
him
it
is
impossible
said
thora
he
asks
you
again
thora
here
is
his
letter
said
magnus
he
gave
it
to
you
to
deliver
i
asked
for
it
and
you
came
to
speak
for
him
i
came
for
myself
as
well
how
good
you
are
to
me
magnus
read
your
letter
said
magnus
and
with
trembling
hands
thora
opened
the
envelope
the
fight
was
short
but
fierce
magnus
watched
every
expression
of
thora
s
face
if
there
had
been
one
ray
of
love
for
him
in
her
looks
of
gratitude
and
remorse
he
would
have
clung
to
the
hope
that
the
time
would
come
when
all
would
be
well
but
love
for
oscar
shone
in
her
eyes
broke
from
her
lips
betrayed
itself
in
the
very
insistence
with
which
she
meant
to
marry
magnus
and
there
remained
no
hope
for
him
anywhere
thora
looked
up
from
her
letter
and
said
how
splendid
how
noble
that
s
what
i
call
brotherly
oscar
tells
me
that
you
think
you
can
put
the
contract
aside
without
involving
me
or
reflecting
upon
him
you
are
too
good
too
generous
too
forgiving
how
can
i
thank
you
by
giving
me
oscar
s
letter
said
magnus
what
do
you
want
with
it
i
want
to
have
it
in
my
pocket
when
i
do
my
work
that
s
only
fair
that
while
i
am
doing
my
part
i
hold
oscar
s
written
assurance
that
he
intends
to
do
his
you
wouldn
t
produce
it
to
oscar
s
injury
many
a
man
sharpens
his
axe
who
never
uses
it
said
magnus
thora
returned
the
letter
to
magnus
and
he
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
now
you
must
answer
it
said
magnus
not
yet
not
immediately
said
thora
immediately
said
magnus
and
taking
pen
and
paper
from
a
sideboard
he
put
them
before
her
the
power
of
the
man
mastered
her
and
she
sat
at
the
table
and
took
up
the
pen
but
why
should
i
write
she
said
why
not
is
the
day
fixed
for
the
betrothal
and
if
i
am
to
do
anything
then
i
must
have
everything
in
black
and
white
but
let
me
have
one
engagement
ended
before
the
other
is
begun
magnus
if
oscar
does
not
receive
your
answer
within
an
hour
he
will
take
the
first
ship
back
to
england
and
you
will
never
see
him
again
he
said
so
yes
you
will
break
my
heart
magnus
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
to
you
write
said
magnus
i
can
not
you
have
driven
everything
out
of
my
head
then
write
to
my
dictation
my
dear
oscar
my
dear
oscar
i
have
received
the
letter

sent
by
magnus

by
magnus
and
i
reciprocate
all
you
say
all
you
say
i
believe
you
love
me
very
dearly
and
that
you
will
never
allow
anything
or
anybody
to
come
between
us
to
come
between
us
magnus
has
given
me
back
my
word
because
i
do
not
love
him
must
i
say
that
magnus
and
because
he
wishes
to
make
me
happy
i
can
not
magnus
i
really
can
not
go
on
thora
therefore
if
he
can

my
father

yours
i
will
marry
you
when
and
where
you
please
because
because
because
i
love
you

all
my
heart
and
soul
and
thora
was
crying
when
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
letter
sign
it
said
magnus
and
she
signed
it
address
it
he
said
and
she
addressed
it
seal
it
he
said
and
she
sealed
it
now
give
it
to
me
said
magnus
and
he
took
the
letter
off
the
table
and
put
it
in
his
breast
pocket
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
thora
deliver
it
myself
said
magnus
no
no
cried
thora
at
least
let
me
keep
it
for
half
an
hour
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
can
not
trust
you
thora
said
magnus
and
he
made
for
the
door
give
it
me
back
give
it
me
give
it
me
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
to
detain
him
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
trembling
in
the
temptation
of
her
embrace
then
he
put
her
gently
aside
and
fled
out
of
the
house
while
he
was
hurrying
through
the
streets
the
warmth
of
thora
s
soft
flesh
was
still
tingling
on
his
neck
and
cheek
and
the
devilish
voice
was
saying
in
his
ear
what
a
fool
you
were
in
another
moment
her
sweet
body
would
have
been
in
your
strong
arms
and
she
would
have
been
yours
for
ever
he
tried
not
to
hear
it
but
the
voice
went
on
she
may
still
be
yours
if
you
re
half
a
man
keep
back
thora
s
letter
and
return
his
own
to
oscar
why
not
what
better
does
he
deserve
of
you
magnus
walked
fast
but
the
voice
followed
him
it
told
him
how
happy
he
had
been
when
he
thought
thora
loved
him
how
he
had
left
her
for
the
mountains
with
his
heart
full
of
joy
how
oscar
had
come
and
everything
was
at
an
end
keep
it
back
return
his
own
said
the
voice
in
his
ear
and
to
make
sure
of
thora
s
happiness
and
to
cure
himself
of
all
hope
he
took
thora
s
letter
out
of
his
pocket
and
ran
with
it
in
his
hand
oscar
was
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
being
too
eager
to
wait
in
his
bedroom
so
you
have
brought
it
she
has
sent
me
an
answer
give
it
me
take
it
said
magnus
but
having
thora
s
letter
in
his
hands
at
last
oscar
was
afraid
to
open
it
is
it
all
right
he
asked
see
for
yourself
said
magnus
and
he
dropped
into
the
seat
by
the
desk
as
oscar
read
the
letter
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
from
fear
to
joy
and
from
joy
to
rapture
without
looking
up
from
the
paper
he
cried
out
like
a
happy
boy
it
s
all
right
she
agrees
god
bless
her
shall
i
read
you
what
she
says
yet
no
that
wouldn
t
be
fair
to
thora
but
it
s
as
right
as
can
be
how
beautiful
talk
of
education
nobody
in
the
world
could
have
put
things
better
the
darling
he
read
the
letter
twice
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
took
it
out
and
read
it
again
and
kissed
it
forgetting
in
his
selfish
happiness
that
anybody
else
was
there
magnus
sat
and
watched
him
the
fight
was
almost
over
but
he
was
nearly
breaking
down
at
last
what
an
age
you
seemed
to
be
away
said
oscar
yet
you
have
run
hard
for
you
are
still
quite
breathless
but
there
is
nothing
more
to
do
now
except
what
you
promised
to
do
you
think
you
can
do
it
i
think
i
can
said
magnus
it
will
be
a
stiff
job
though
to
persuade
two
old
men
who
don
t
wish
to
be
persuaded
nobody
wants
to
see
his
schemes
upset
and
his
contracts
broken
and
with
all
the
in
the
world
to
me
wait
said
magnus
rising
his
unshaven
face
had
suddenly
grown
hard
and
ugly
we
have
talked
of
you
and
thora
and
of
the
factor
and
the
governor
but
there
is
somebody
who
has
not
been
too
much
mentioned
myself
don
t
suppose
i
am
forgetting
you
though
said
oscar
i
can
never
do
that
and
neither
can
thora
never
if
i
am
to
stand
back
and
take
the
consequences
there
is
something
you
owe
me
you
owe
me
your
silence
assuredly
said
oscar
whatever
i
do
or
say
said
magnus
you
must
never
allow
it
to
be
seen
that
you
know
my
object
is
it
a
promise
certainly
said
oscar
silence
is
inevitable
if
i
am
to
save
thora
from
her
father
s
anger
and
i
will
save
her
from
that
and
from
every
sorrow
magnus
walked
to
the
door
and
then
for
the
first
time
oscar
looked
at
him
but
what
a
brute
i
am
always
talking
of
myself
said
oscar
following
his
brother
to
the
landing
when
everything
is
satisfactorily
settled
what
is
to
happen
to
you
magnus
god
knows
said
magnus
with
his
foot
on
the
stair
everybody
has
his
own
wounds
to
bandage
well
god
bless
you
in
any
case
old
fellow
said
oscar
patting
magnus
on
the
shoulder
and
then
he
returned
to
his
room
and
took
out
thora
s
letter
and
read
it
over
again
the
betrothal
was
fixed
for
five
o
clock
on
the
following
afternoon
aunt
margret
had
had
women
in
to
clean
the
house
down
and
everything
was
like
a
new
pin
the
large
looking
toward
the
town
was
prepared
for
the
legal
part
of
the
ceremony
with
pens
and
ink
on
the
round
table
and
the
smaller
divided
from
it
by
a
plush
curtain
and
overlooking
the
lake
was
laid
out
with
a
long
dining
table
covered
with
cakes
and
cups
and
saucers
and
surrounded
by
chairs
these
rooms
were
standing
quiet
and
solemn
when
at
four
aunt
margret
came
down
in
her
best
black
silk
and
with
ringlets
newly
curled
to
have
a
last
look
round
she
was
doing
a
little
final
dusting
when
the
first
of
her
guests
arrived
this
was
anna
also
in
black
silk
and
being
already
on
her
company
manners
aunt
margret
kissed
her
but
where
s
oscar
and
where
s
the
governor
asked
aunt
margret
stephen
is
coming
said
anna
but
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
where
oscar
is
the
boy
is
here
and
there
and
everywhere
that
reminds
me
of
something
said
aunt
margret
can
you
tell
me
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
young
folks
missed
each
other
at
thingvellir
yesterday
and
magnus
came
home
alone
goodness
knows
it
wouldn
t
be
magnus
s
fault
that
s
certain
magnus
is
like
my
poor
father
as
sure
to
be
in
his
place
as
a
on
the
tread
but
oscar
is
as
hard
to
hold
as
a
puff
of
wind
it
s
his
nature
he
can
t
help
it
but
it
makes
me
anxious
when
i
think
of
it
margret
don
t
be
afraid
for
oscar
anna
he
ll
come
out
all
right
and
if
he
is
restless
and
unsettled
god
is
good
to
such
weak
heart
he
never
asks
more
than
he
gives
you
know
the
factor
came
downstairs
a
tall
man
and
a
little
hard
and
angular
wearing
evening
dress
and
a
and
carrying
a
long
german
pipe
in
his
hand
no
smoking
yet
cried
aunt
margret
and
with
a
grunt
and
a
laugh
the
factor
laid
his
pipe
on
the
and
how
s
anna
he
said
no
need
to
ask
that
though
our
anna
is
as
fresh
and
young
as
ever
upon
my
word
margret
it
only
seems
like
yesterday
that
we
were
doing
all
this
for
anna
herself
she
was
a
different
anna
in
those
days
oscar
said
anna
not
a
bit
of
it
there
s
a
little
more
anna
now
that
s
the
only
difference
the
governor
came
in
next
a
man
of
medium
height
with
a
beard
but
no
mustache
and
wearing
his
official
uniform
bright
with
gold
braid
he
saluted
the
factor
and
said
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
ask
the
bishop
the
rector
of
the
latin
school
and
the
sheriff
to
join
us
i
trust
you
don
t
object
quite
right
old
friend
said
the
factor
the
most
important
acts
of
life
ought
always
to
be
done
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
and
how
s
margret
as
busy
as
usual
i
see
all
days
don
t
come
on
the
same
date
we
must
get
ready
for
you
next
you
know
for
margret
laughed
the
factor
she
ll
have
to
be
quick
or
she
ll
be
late
then
people
don
t
hatch
many
chickens
at
christmas
late
indeed
said
aunt
margret
with
a
toss
of
her
ringlets
if
i
couldn
t
catch
up
to
you
folks
with
your
pair
of
chicks
apiece
i
shouldn
t
think
it
worth
while
to
begin
the
men
laughed
and
anna
said
well
two
children
would
be
enough
for
me
if
i
could
only
keep
them
but
that
s
the
worst
of
having
boys
they
marry
and
leave
you
a
mother
can
always
keep
her
girls
until
somebody
else
s
boys
come
and
carry
them
off
and
then
she
sees
no
more
of
either
said
aunt
margret
that
depends
on
circumstances
said
the
governor
the
marriage
contract
for
example
eh
old
friend
exactly
said
the
factor
you
can
generally
keep
the
bull
about
the
place
if
you
have
the
cow
locked
up
in
the
the
men
laughed
again
and
then
the
bishop
and
the
rector
arrived
the
bishop
a
saintly
patriarch
with
a
soft
face
and
a
white
beard
and
the
rector
as
became
the
schoolmaster
sharper
if
not
more
severe
i
was
surprised
when
i
heard
it
was
magnus
said
the
rector
oscar
has
beaten
his
brother
in
most
things
and
i
thought
he
would
beat
him
in
getting
a
wife
and
then
thora
and
he
are
such
friends
too
and
so
like
each
other
they
get
on
worst
together
who
are
most
like
each
other
said
anna
and
aunt
margret
said
stuff
a
dark
man
s
a
jewel
in
a
fair
woman
s
eye
and
what
does
thora
want
with
a
fair
one
but
where
is
thora
asked
the
bishop
she
s
dressing
said
aunt
margret
let
us
go
and
fetch
her
down
anna
and
the
two
women
went
magnus
ought
to
be
here
too
said
the
governor
where
is
he
i
wonder
were
you
asking
for
magnus
said
a
voice
from
the
hall
it
was
the
sheriff
a
small
man
with
a
sly
face
wearing
a
uniform
like
the
governor
s
he
s
at
the
warehouse
isn
t
he
or
is
he
still
at
the
jetty
asked
the
factor
no
said
the
sheriff
entering
to
tell
you
the
truth
when
i
passed
the
hotel
he
was
sitting
in
the
the
of
the
hotel
said
the
governor
the
factor
laughed
treating
his
friends
in
advance
of
the
event
i
suppose
it
s
bad
to
let
the
sledge
go
ahead
of
the
horse
though
no
said
the
sheriff
again
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
was
quite
alone
drinking
asked
the
governor
nonsense
stephen
magnus
does
not
drink
said
the
factor
i
hope
not
but
i
m
always
afraid
of
it
his
grandfather
on
the
maternal
side
you
know
ah
nobody
knows
what
is
inside
another
s
coat
said
the
bishop
anna
s
father
had
some
trouble
in
his
head
must
have
had
even
diseases
are
inherited
said
the
governor
but
the
old
man
drank
after
he
buried
his
wife
not
before
he
married
her
said
the
rector
and
then
aunt
margret
and
anna
returned
to
the
room
saying
here
she
is
at
last
bringing
thora
in
her
simple
velvet
costume
called
the
kirtle
with
silver
belt
bell
sleeves
and
white
lace
about
the
neck
the
governor
took
thora
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
but
how
pale
my
child
he
said
you
may
well
say
so
governor
said
aunt
margret
she
has
been
crying
since
early
morning
crying
said
the
factor
now
i
never
can
understand
why
a
woman
must
always
cry
when
she
is
going
to
be
married
it
s
such
a
bad
compliment
to
her
husband
but
i
agree
with
thora
said
the
governor
if
ever
there
is
a
time
to
cry
or
at
least
to
feel
grave
and
anxious
it
is
just
that
moment
of
life
when
it
is
customary
to
dance
and
sing
as
if
you
were
setting
out
on
a
triumphal
procession
instead
of
taking
a
leap
into
the
dark
and
i
agree
with
the
governor
said
the
bishop
when
i
see
a
bride
crying
so
bitterly
at
the
altar
that
she
can
hardly
utter
the
responses
i
generally
know
she
is
going
to
be
a
happy
wife
thora
might
wait
until
the
wedding
though
said
aunt
margret
and
then
oscar
came
dashing
into
the
room
out
walking
lost
count
of
the
time
only
six
minutes
to
dress
did
it
in
five
he
said
in
breathless
gasps
he
s
another
pale
one
laughed
the
rector
has
there
been
a
frost
overnight
that
has
nipped
all
our
been
running
to
get
here
said
oscar
but
i
ve
raced
magnus
it
seems
magnus
has
raced
you
in
another
way
my
boy
said
the
rector
nodding
his
head
toward
thora
who
was
blushing
and
looking
down
whereupon
the
governor
muttered
oscar
must
not
dream
of
marriage
yet
awhile
he
has
his
career
to
think
about
and
he
has
not
been
too
earnest
about
it
hitherto
well
my
experience
in
business
said
the
factor
is
that
when
a
woman
marries
she
slackens
off
but
when
a
man
marries
he
tightens
up
at
that
the
sheriff
nudged
the
rector
who
whispered
the
factor
has
still
another
daughter
rector
what
if
he
has
said
the
factor
a
man
can
t
have
two
to
one
brother
no
but
he
can
give
his
brother
a
too
said
the
rector
and
then
everybody
laughed
that
reminds
me
said
the
factor
helga
sent
us
a
photograph
the
other
day
where
is
it
thora
here
it
is
said
thora
taking
a
photograph
out
of
a
drawer
oscar
held
out
his
hand
for
it
and
looked
at
it
long
and
earnestly
how
fine
i
ve
scarcely
ever
seen
such
a
splendid
face
quite
grown
up
too
is
helga
coming
home
soon
factor
not
very
soon
said
the
factor
and
then
the
lawyer
came
in
with
a
large
portfolio
of
papers
and
laid
them
on
the
table
ha
ha
laughed
the
hector
a
rich
man
s
child
needs
a
careful
christening
it
seems
you
re
right
rector
and
it
has
taken
my
clerk
the
entire
day
to
engross
the
contract
but
it
was
not
that
which
kept
me
until
now
it
was
this
the
rings
cried
the
two
elder
women
as
the
lawyer
took
a
small
plush
box
from
his
pocket
yes
you
may
remember
that
when
the
rings
had
to
be
ordered
yesterday
morning
magnus
could
not
be
found
anywhere
so
i
was
compelled
to
order
them
myself
well
i
thought
i
gave
careful
instructions
but
the
idea
is
abroad
in
the
town
do
you
know
that
it
is
oscar
not
magnus
who
is
to
marry
thora
nobody
believes
anything
else
so
what
does
olaf
the
silversmith
do
but
write
oscar
on
the
inside
of
one
of
the
rings
never
said
oscar
trying
to
laugh
with
the
others
yes
indeed
and
the
error
was
not
discovered
until
the
very
last
moment
and
then
all
i
could
do
as
you
see
was
to
have
oscar
erased
it
was
too
late
to
have
magnus
inscribed
instead
where
is
magnus
i
wonder
said
the
governor
walking
restlessly
before
the
window
don
t
be
anxious
about
magnus
stephen
said
anna
he
grows
more
and
more
like
my
poor
father
if
father
promised
to
be
somewhere
at
a
certain
time
he
would
turn
up
to
the
minute
if
he
had
to
kill
a
couple
of
ponies
in
getting
there
the
cathedral
clock
struck
five
at
that
moment
and
sure
enough
before
the
clang
of
the
last
stroke
had
died
away
magnus
walked
into
the
room
he
looked
slack
and
almost
untidy
in
his
pea
jacket
and
long
boots
and
was
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
had
not
troubled
to
dress
for
the
occasion
the
governor
s
face
darkened
at
sight
of
him
and
the
factor
said
in
a
tone
of
vexation
well
let
us
get
to
work
and
have
it
over
i
ve
been
spoiling
for
a
smoke
this
the
lawyer
opened
his
portfolio
and
the
company
gathered
about
the
table
whereupon
aunt
margret
cried
magnus
do
you
allow
of
this
here
s
oscar
sitting
beside
thora
don
t
disturb
him
said
magnus
this
is
good
enough
for
me
and
he
took
a
low
seat
by
the
side
of
his
mother
now
come
said
the
factor
let
the
one
who
has
the
best
voice
start
the
singing
it
must
be
the
lawyer
then
said
the
rector
for
every
lawyer
has
a
voice
of
silver
passes
it
for
silver
anyway
and
then
amid
the
general
laughter
the
lawyer
opened
the
marriage
contract
and
began
to
read
the
company
listened
intently
and
at
the
close
of
every
clause
the
governor
who
was
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
and
his
elbow
on
the
table
said
good
very
good
generous
most
generous
when
the
lawyer
had
finished
the
other
old
people
leaned
back
and
drew
long
breaths
of
satisfaction
but
the
governor
rose
and
crossed
to
the
factor
and
shook
hands
with
him
saying
just
like
you
old
friend
the
factor
was
gratified
by
the
reception
of
the
document
and
became
bright
and
almost
humorous
imitating
the
manner
of
the
auctioneer
he
cried
anybody
bid
higher
then
going
going
go
wait
said
the
governor
hadn
t
we
better
ask
the
opinion
of
the
young
people
themselves
after
all
they
are
the
persons
ultimately
concerned
and
though
a
cow
seldom
kicks
when
you
are
carrying
her
clover
there
was
a
general
titter
a
nodding
of
many
heads
and
muttered
responses
of
just
so
just
a
matter
of
form
very
well
thora
what
do
you
say
said
the
factor
expecting
a
burst
of
rapturous
approval
but
thora
only
answered
timidly
i
don
t
know
hadn
t
you
better
ask
magnus
first
certainly
my
dear
magnus
first
as
a
matter
of
course
what
do
you
say
magnus
any
suggestion
to
make
any
little
improvement
how
do
you
like
the
contract
there
was
an
awkward
silence
which
astonished
the
older
people
and
then
came
a
great
surprise
magnus
who
had
been
sitting
with
his
head
down
raised
a
white
and
face
and
answered
i
do
not
like
the
contract
at
all
factor
and
i
can
not
sign
it
at
this
there
were
looks
of
bewilderment
among
the
older
people
who
seemed
to
be
uncertain
if
they
had
heard
aright
while
thora
and
oscar
who
partly
understood
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
catch
their
breath
the
factor
was
the
first
to
recover
his
and
he
said
with
a
slightly
supercilious
accent
is
that
so
i
thought
i
knew
something
of
these
matters
but
if
you
think
you
can
draw
up
a
better
document
magnus
but
then
the
governor
interposed
some
trifle
no
doubt
he
said
suavely
magnus
will
explain
what
is
the
point
you
object
to
my
son
there
was
another
moment
of
tense
silence
and
then
magnus
said
in
a
harsh
voice
by
this
contract
i
am
required
to
live
in
iceland
all
my
life
that
s
slavery
and
i
will
not
submit
to
it
but
my
dear
magnus
said
anna
don
t
you
see
the
reason
for
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
thora
is
the
factor
s
only
daughter
his
only
child
and
if
she
goes
away
who
is
to
cheer
him
up
and
make
home
bright
for
him
be
reasonable
magnus
anna
hadn
t
we
better
let
the
young
man
finish
said
the
factor
he
may
have
other
objections
have
you
yes
said
magnus
according
to
this
contract
i
am
to
be
taken
into
partnership
on
marrying
thora
but
only
on
a
quarter
share
partnership
is
partnership
and
where
there
are
two
partners
it
should
be
half
and
half
i
must
have
half
the
company
listened
in
consternation
and
the
factor
began
to
laugh
why
not
he
said
in
a
cynical
tone
everything
is
hay
in
hard
weather
i
m
so
hard
up
for
a
that
i
shouldn
t
stick
at
a
trifle
old
friend
said
the
governor
let
us
not
be
too
hasty
perhaps
magnus
has
not
made
himself
quite
plain
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
he
wants
an
equal
partnership
but
perhaps
that
is
not
all
is
there
anything
else
yes
there
is
sir
said
magnus
in
a
rather
aggressive
manner
by
this
deed
when
you
retire
i
am
to
take
over
the
business
but
i
am
only
to
have
share
of
the
profits
i
must
have
in
deed
said
the
factor
do
you
know
i
thought
if
i
allowed
you
to
come
into
the
business
that
i
had
made
and
to
work
it
with
my
plant
and
my
capital
was
generous
most
generous
said
the
governor
mopping
his
forehead
but
magnus
is
slow
slow
both
of
thought
and
speech
he
must
have
some
explanation
what
do
you
mean
magnus
take
your
time
and
speak
plainly
i
mean
sir
said
magnus
that
the
barter
business
in
iceland
will
break
up
before
long
when
the
factor
retires
perhaps
before
his
business
will
be
worth
nothing
not
even
the
name
for
that
will
be
less
than
nothing
a
new
business
will
have
to
be
created
and
if
i
am
to
create
it
i
must
have
of
the
profits
leaving
for
the
use
of
the
factor
s
money
the
factor
was
losing
his
temper
why
any
at
all
he
said
why
not
kick
me
out
altogether
no
use
beating
a
dog
with
a
cheese
when
a
whip
is
handy
the
company
were
murmuring
at
magnus
when
the
governor
interposed
again
magnus
he
said
to
say
i
m
astonished
is
to
say
nothing
the
factor
has
treated
you
with
boundless
liberality
but
no
well
is
so
deep
that
it
can
t
be
emptied
and
if
you
go
any
farther
go
any
farther
said
the
factor
why
shouldn
t
he
go
farther
it
isn
t
fair
play
between
the
wind
and
a
straw
but
why
shouldn
t
he
beat
me
about
a
little
more
anything
else
to
ask
sir
yes
said
magnus
without
the
change
of
a
muscle
by
this
contract
my
wife
is
to
inherit
half
her
father
s
fortune
at
his
death
she
must
inherit
the
whole
of
it
good
lord
the
exclamation
seemed
to
come
from
everybody
in
the
general
chorus
of
condemnation
which
followed
are
you
dreaming
cried
the
governor
do
you
forget
that
the
factor
has
another
daughter
no
sir
i
do
not
forget
it
said
magnus
but
the
other
daughter
has
gone
away
with
her
mother
she
may
never
come
back
and
after
thora
has
spent
her
life
by
her
father
s
side
cheering
him
up
and
making
his
home
bright
as
mother
says
and
perhaps
nursing
him
in
his
last
days
is
somebody
else
who
has
done
nothing
to
sweep
off
half
of
all
he
leaves
behind
no
my
wife
if
i
marry
must
have
everything
the
older
people
both
strangers
and
members
of
the
family
broke
into
loud
expressions
of
dissent
while
the
factor
looked
round
at
them
and
said
an
eagle
isn
t
displeased
with
a
dead
sheep
is
it
and
so
governor
s
son
he
said
wheeling
about
on
magnus
these
are
the
only
terms
on
which
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
marry
my
daughter
without
noticing
the
sneer
magnus
answered
yes
well
i
must
say
i
m
deceived
in
magnus
said
aunt
margret
i
didn
t
think
he
had
a
selfish
thought
in
his
heart
i
didn
t
think
said
the
factor
who
was
not
laughing
any
longer
i
didn
t
think
the
son
of
anybody
in
iceland
could
afford
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
a
daughter
of
mine
neilsen
said
the
governor
firmly
we
have
been
friends
since
we
were
boys
and
neither
of
us
knows
which
will
bury
the
other
don
t
let
us
quarrel
now
over
the
conduct
of
our
children
the
company
murmured
approval
and
then
the
governor
turned
once
more
to
magnus
my
son
for
you
are
my
son
though
i
m
at
a
loss
to
understand
it
you
are
making
a
breach
between
two
families
by
asking
these
utterly
impossible
terms
don
t
you
see
they
are
impossible
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
are
you
quite
mad
or
is
it
true
that
you
have
been
drinking
that
you
are
drunk
good
god
magnus
made
no
answer
but
the
painful
silence
which
followed
the
governor
s
outburst
was
broken
by
a
pitiful
cry
it
came
from
thora
she
understood
everything
at
last
she
knew
what
magnus
was
doing
for
her
and
the
price
he
was
going
to
pay
for
it
and
she
wanted
to
cry
out
but
could
not
so
she
dropped
her
head
on
aunt
margret
s
shoulder
and
wept
bitterly
anna
mistook
thora
s
tears
for
shame
and
humiliation
and
turning
to
magnus
she
said
my
dear
son
you
haven
t
thought
of
things
in
the
right
way
or
you
couldn
t
do
what
you
are
doing
i
don
t
like
these
marriage
contracts
myself
it
seems
like
a
tempting
of
providence
to
talk
about
money
and
business
just
when
two
souls
who
love
one
another
are
joining
themselves
together
and
becoming
one
but
you
are
making
it
worse
magnus
you
are
making
it
a
mere
bargain
and
then
think
of
thora
if
you
refuse
her
father
s
offer
everybody
will
hear
of
it
and
the
poor
girl
will
be
shamed
do
you
want
to
see
that
magnus
i
m
sure
you
do
not
so
come
now
for
thora
s
sake
even
though
you
don
t
quite
like
the
factor
s
conditions
for
thora
s
sake
magnus
will
you
not
everybody
waited
for
magnus
s
reply
and
even
thora
raised
her
head
no
said
magnus
in
a
voice
like
a
growl
and
then
he
sat
with
a
stolid
face
while
the
condemnation
of
the
company
fell
upon
him
in
a
chorus
of
denunciation
infamous
hateful
execrable
damnable
the
man
s
heart
must
be
as
black
as
a
raven
oscar
could
bear
no
more
he
had
been
sitting
silent
with
head
down
as
if
trying
to
hide
his
agitated
face
while
turning
helga
s
photograph
over
and
over
in
his
restless
fingers
but
now
he
rose
walked
to
the
curtains
which
divided
the
front
room
from
the
back
parted
them
with
a
trembling
hand
and
looked
out
over
the
lake
on
which
the
sun
was
setting
don
t
go
away
oscar
cried
the
governor
i
know
you
are
disgusted
with
your
brother
s
turpitude
but
i
want
you
to
speak
to
him
for
all
that
it
is
hardly
likely
that
having
refused
to
pay
attention
to
his
mother
or
me
he
should
listen
to
you
or
anybody
else
but
try
him
for
the
honor
of
the
family
tell
him
that
if
he
adheres
to
the
attitude
he
has
taken
up
he
will
be
an
object
of
hatred
and
contempt
as
long
as
he
lives
people
will
despise
him
and
his
family
will
be
ashamed
to
acknowledge
his
name
if
he
has
no
love
for
thora
see
if
he
has
any
respect
for
himself
speak
to
your
brother
oscar
for
mercy
s
sake
speak
to
him
oscar
s
hand
on
the
curtain
shook
visibly
and
he
said
with
an
effort
while
all
listened
without
breathing
and
thora
s
parted
lips
quivered
i
can
not
do
that
father
i
do
not
feel
that
i
have
any
right
no
doubt
magnus
knows
as
well
as
we
do
what
he
is
doing
and
has
counted
all
the
consequences
everybody
has
to
live
his
own
life
at
this
there
was
a
murmur
of
disappointment
and
the
governor
turning
away
walked
to
the
window
then
oscar
stepped
back
to
the
table
and
said
more
firmly
yet
with
as
much
emotion
but
if
i
can
not
appeal
to
magnus
there
is
something
i
can
do
i
can
offer
to
take
magnus
s
place
if
you
and
the
factor
will
consent
i
can
accept
the
conditions
of
the
contract
just
as
they
are
and
be
only
too
proud
to
marry
thora
if
she
will
accept
me
at
first
there
were
looks
of
blank
amazement
about
the
table
then
a
general
sigh
of
relief
and
everybody
seemed
to
be
saying
at
once
good
splendid
the
very
thing
yes
said
the
voice
of
the
governor
husky
with
emotion
it
is
just
like
oscar
always
doing
the
great
thing
but
in
a
matter
which
so
intimately
concerns
the
boy
s
future
welfare
i
can
not
allow
a
momentary
impulse
of
generosity
it
isn
t
a
momentary
impulse
father
since
i
came
home
from
england
i
have
learnt
to
love
thora
but
she
was
engaged
to
my
brother
and
i
couldn
t
speak
until
magnus
had
spoken
honorable
most
honorable
said
several
voices
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
oscar
could
go
on
but
now
if
it
is
understood
that
magnus
retires
that
is
to
say
refuses
to
marry
thora
he
does
undoubtedly
he
does
said
the
factor
and
if
thora
will
take
me
every
eye
looked
toward
thora
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
rose
from
her
chair
and
timidly
held
out
her
hand
oscar
grasped
it
eagerly
and
there
was
a
chorus
of
congratulation
but
we
can
not
allow
thora
either
to
be
carried
away
by
a
momentary
impulse
said
aunt
margret
who
was
vigorously
wiping
her
eyes
and
if
she
s
only
doing
this
to
escape
from
a
shameful
position
i
m
not
auntie
said
thora
i
only
consented
to
marry
magnus
because
my
father
wished
it
but
i
love
oscar
and
if
father
will
agree
the
factor
s
eyes
were
sparkling
with
the
light
of
triumph
and
he
cried
across
to
the
governor
what
do
say
stephen
well
i
must
say
it
s
fast
ambling
too
fast
said
the
governor
but
if
the
young
people
are
satisfied
and
if
oscar
is
content
to
give
up
his
career
in
england
his
music
and
his
studies
and
live
in
iceland
all
his
life
it
may
save
a
breach
between
our
families
and
tide
us
over
an
ugly
reef
then
so
be
it
godson
cried
the
factor
slapping
oscar
on
the
back
and
as
for
england
i
ll
take
care
of
that
this
was
received
with
a
shout
of
approval
from
the
strangers
and
then
the
factor
called
to
the
lawyer
to
alter
the
names
in
the
contract
and
get
it
signed
without
delay
as
for
you
sir
he
said
turning
to
magnus
and
snapping
his
fingers
in
his
face
your
ugly
chickens
have
come
home
to
roost
you
thought
you
could
corner
me
but
your
selfishness
and
worldliness
have
done
the
work
that
everybody
seems
to
have
wanted
ha
ha
ha
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
there
s
nothing
i
like
better
than
to
dish
a
man
who
tries
to
dish
me
and
i
ll
go
to
bed
happy
magnus
had
risen
from
his
low
seat
and
was
standing
with
his
head
down
and
his
hands
on
his
hips
while
the
storm
beat
over
him
and
thinking
he
was
still
unmoved
the
factor
burst
upon
him
again
in
a
tone
of
biting
raillery
but
if
the
barter
trade
is
going
to
the
dogs
hadn
t
you
better
cut
it
before
the
crash
comes
heavy
is
the
fall
you
know
when
an
old
man
tumbles
and
i
might
crush
you
coming
down
i
ll
trouble
you
to
leave
my
house
sir
without
a
day
s
delay
father
cried
thora
and
she
stepped
between
them
but
the
factor
brushed
her
aside
you
get
away
thora
if
a
daughter
of
mine
had
done
to
me
what
he
has
tried
to
do
she
wouldn
t
have
a
roof
to
cover
her
neither
shall
a
son
of
mine
not
in
this
town
at
all
events
said
the
governor
magnus
stephenson
stephen
stephen
said
anna
and
oscar
in
the
same
quivering
voice
as
before
cried
out
to
his
father
hold
your
tongue
anna
oscar
be
quiet
you
ve
done
enough
for
one
day
magnus
stephenson
when
you
leave
the
factor
s
house
you
will
go
to
thingvellir
and
stay
there
and
thank
your
stars
if
for
the
rest
of
your
life
you
are
allowed
to
earn
your
bread
by
the
sweat
of
your
brow
the
amended
contract
is
ready
for
the
signatures
said
the
lawyer
and
then
everybody
save
one
turned
back
to
the
table
and
there
was
a
cackle
of
cheerful
voices
when
the
names
were
all
signed
and
witnessed
the
rings
were
exchanged
and
there
was
some
joking
and
happy
laughter
all
s
well
that
ends
well
said
the
bishop
that
will
do
as
a
pledge
between
you
until
you
come
to
me
to
be
made
man
and
wife
supper
is
ready
cried
aunt
margret
drawing
the
curtains
of
the
inner
room
and
then
seeing
a
photograph
on
the
floor
beneath
them
she
said
but
who
s
been
treading
on
poor
helga
s
portrait
that
s
oscar
said
thora
he
had
it
in
his
hand
when
he
got
up
when
the
company
were
seated
about
the
supper
table
it
was
seen
that
there
was
one
chair
too
many
and
the
governor
pushed
it
back
with
an
impatient
hand
magnus
had
gone
no
one
had
seen
him
go
alone
and
forgotten
a
prey
to
the
devilish
voices
which
had
tortured
him
in
the
time
of
his
temptation
angry
and
unsatisfied
although
he
had
carried
out
his
purpose
and
triumphed
as
he
had
intended
magnus
was
in
his
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
gathering
up
his
belongings
by
the
light
of
a
candle
they
were
few
and
not
valuable
a
little
money
two
or
three
suits
of
clothes
two
or
three
pairs
of
riding
fishing
and
snow
boots
some
musical
exercise
books
the
book
of
job
the
pilgrim
s
progress
having
illustrations
of
apollyon
with
horns
and
the
precious
flute
with
which
he
had
beguiled
those
blessed
evenings
that
now
seemed
to
belong
to
another
existence
he
had
sent
for
two
ponies
to
take
him
to
the
farm
a
saddle
pony
and
a
pack
pony
and
two
small
boxes
held
everything
when
all
was
packed
he
came
upon
the
remains
of
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
he
had
kept
in
his
bedroom
as
medicine
and
he
drank
the
spirit
and
threw
the
bottle
away
during
that
short
hour
of
pain
and
degradation
he
heard
at
intervals
the
various
noises
of
the
company
at
supper
below
sometimes
in
single
voices
sometimes
in
climbing
cries
like
the
sounds
of
a
geyser
sometimes
in
peals
of
joyous
laughter
and
his
heart
grew
bitter
he
could
plainly
distinguish
oscar
s
voice
among
the
rest
at
first
quiet
enough
but
afterward
loud
and
hilarious
and
his
very
soul
sickened
you
fool
said
the
other
voices
at
his
ear
what
did
you
expect
did
you
think
he
would
be
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
he
is
glad
he
ll
walk
over
your
head
and
over
thora
s
head
too
listen
to
him
already
the
sweet
unselfish
privileged
pet
of
everybody
after
the
boxes
had
been
sent
magnus
took
a
last
look
round
and
then
he
tried
to
shut
out
all
bitter
thoughts
and
evil
passions
for
he
believed
that
he
was
leaving
that
room
for
ever
it
had
been
his
home
through
seven
long
years
and
some
of
them
had
been
bad
years
but
some
of
them
had
been
good
and
the
good
ones
filled
the
little
place
with
memories
of
many
visions
the
sloping
roof
the
dormer
window
the
deal
furniture
the
sheep
s
skin
on
the
bare
floor
and
the
sunflower
pattern
on
the
were
all
ghosts
of
the
dreams
he
had
dreamt
there
some
were
dreams
of
the
great
things
he
was
going
to
do
for
iceland
but
more
were
dreams
of
thora
and
remembering
that
both
sorts
were
dead
now
and
that
thora
belonged
to
oscar
to
save
himself
from
further
repining
and
to
crush
down
the
riot
that
was
rising
within
he
blew
out
the
candle
and
that
chapter
of
his
life
was
at
an
end
but
the
devilish
voices
were
not
yet
done
with
him
going
he
had
to
pass
the
door
of
the
front
room
on
the
first
landing
and
he
went
by
it
on
tiptoe
for
years
he
had
always
passed
that
door
on
tiptoe
for
it
was
the
door
to
thora
s
room
a
holy
place
half
nursery
half
sanctuary
as
thora
herself
had
grown
to
be
half
saint
to
him
and
half
child
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
that
this
time
he
was
thinking
he
must
get
out
of
the
house
without
seeing
her
again
for
she
belonged
to
oscar
now
and
if
they
were
to
meet
and
she
began
to
thank
him
for
giving
her
to
oscar
but
god
forbid
thora
s
door
was
closed
but
the
next
room
stood
open
it
was
aunt
margret
s
bedroom
and
magnus
knew
that
a
photograph
of
thora
was
on
the
chest
of
drawers
near
the
door
he
had
often
envied
it
and
now
he
stooped
to
look
at
it
for
the
last
time
and
the
voices
at
his
ear
seemed
to
say
take
it
it
s
all
you
are
going
to
carry
away
of
her
going
down
the
last
flight
of
stairs
he
heard
the
two
buzzing
like
the
and
knew
that
others
must
have
joined
the
party
but
above
all
other
sounds
he
heard
the
sound
of
oscar
s
voice
clear
as
a
flute
saluting
people
as
they
came
in
listen
to
him
the
darling
said
the
mocking
voices
by
his
side
coming
to
the
hall
he
encountered
some
of
the
women
of
the
town
in
their
dresses
and
with
garden
flowers
in
their
hands
hardly
any
of
them
looked
at
him
but
all
passed
into
the
where
oscar
waited
to
welcome
them
the
in
the
hall
had
been
cleared
for
the
therefore
magnus
had
to
go
to
a
rail
under
the
stairs
for
his
overcoat
and
and
while
he
was
there
aunt
margret
opened
the
door
of
the
back
to
ventilate
the
crowded
place
she
did
not
see
him
for
she
had
taken
off
the
spectacles
she
usually
wore
and
he
was
standing
in
the
shadow
but
he
saw
everybody
in
the
room
and
thora
among
the
rest
thora
was
sitting
by
the
wall
and
the
townspeople
were
going
up
to
her
one
after
another
and
offering
their
flowers
and
making
congratulatory
speeches
and
she
was
thanking
them
in
her
soft
voice
and
looking
very
happy
magnus
was
hurt
by
thora
s
happiness
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
make
her
happy
he
had
sacrificed
everything
but
now
that
he
looked
on
her
happiness
he
was
hurt
by
it
and
when
oscar
went
and
stood
by
her
chair
looking
bright
and
proud
he
felt
hot
with
anger
and
hatred
while
he
pulled
on
his
overcoat
he
could
not
help
hearing
what
was
being
said
within
the
room
such
an
extraordinary
thing
thora
said
one
people
in
the
town
actually
said
it
was
magnus
you
were
going
to
marry
i
heard
that
too
said
another
i
heard
it
at
olaf
s
the
silversmith
s
when
we
were
drinking
coffee
such
an
idea
said
a
third
as
if
any
girl
would
marry
magnus
who
could
get
oscar
and
then
oscar
s
voice
large
expansive
indulgent
almost
patronizing
tut
tut
you
mustn
t
say
anything
against
magnus
elisabet
but
i
hear
magnus
insulted
thora
this
evening
and
the
factor
has
turned
him
out
for
it
can
it
be
possible
i
saw
him
in
the
hall
as
i
was
coming
in
no
no
not
insulted
not
insulted
exactly
said
oscar
s
voice
again
and
then
magnus
sick
and
dizzy
turned
away
he
was
going
out
of
the
house
with
head
down
when
the
door
of
the
front
opened
and
closed
quickly
and
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
thora
she
was
trying
to
look
sad
but
the
light
of
her
happiness
was
still
in
her
eyes
and
her
parted
lips
were
smiling
i
heard
you
were
here
she
said
and
i
couldn
t
help
coming
out
to
see
you
oscar
told
me
yesterday
i
was
not
to
speak
whatever
happened
but
it
seems
so
terrible
that
you
should
leave
us
like
this
we
made
a
mistake
and
we
had
to
get
out
of
it
somehow
said
magnus
i
know
said
thora
and
of
course
i
think
it
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
end
you
would
have
had
no
joy
of
me
magnus
and
i
should
have
been
very
unhappy
perhaps
you
would
said
magnus
but
it
is
a
great
grief
to
me
that
you
will
have
to
give
up
all
the
schemes
you
had
set
your
heart
upon
magnus
i
have
given
up
more
than
that
thora
said
magnus
and
he
tried
to
push
past
her
and
go
the
light
of
her
smile
died
off
her
face
and
with
a
wistful
look
in
a
pleading
voice
she
said
i
feel
as
if
i
am
losing
a
friend
magnus
and
you
are
saying
to
me
for
good
not
that
exactly
said
magnus
magnus
they
were
standing
with
hands
clasped
in
what
they
believed
to
be
their
last
parting
when
the
buzz
of
the
inner
room
broke
out
upon
them
again
and
a
cheery
voice
cried
thora
thora
where
are
you
oh
it
s
you
magnus
it
was
oscar
and
at
the
next
moment
thora
had
gone
back
the
door
of
the
had
closed
behind
her
and
magnus
and
his
brother
were
together
in
the
hall
i
meant
to
come
out
to
you
before
old
fellow
said
oscar
but
they
stuck
to
me
like
leeches
and
i
couldn
t
get
away
i
wanted
to
thank
you
for
what
you
did
for
me
this
evening
it
was
too
generous
too
brotherly
and
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
magnus
did
not
answer
so
oscar
went
on
you
pledged
me
to
silence
and
you
were
right
plainly
right
but
of
course
i
can
not
allow
the
error
about
your
motive
to
go
much
farther
and
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
to
do
so
i
will
set
you
right
people
shall
know
the
truth
about
what
you
did
and
why
you
did
it
and
they
will
make
amends
for
their
mistake
still
magnus
did
not
speak
so
oscar
continued
it
s
too
bad
though
that
you
should
suffer
in
the
meantime
and
if
there
is
anything
i
could
do
for
you
in
a
material
way
i
mean
if
you
are
in
want
of
but
the
dark
fire
that
was
rising
in
magnus
s
face
frightened
him
and
he
could
not
finish
what
he
wished
to
say
i
don
t
care
a
straw
what
people
think
i
did
it
for
said
magnus
and
i
don
t
care
a
damn
if
they
never
make
amends
you
know
what
i
did
it
for
and
that
s
enough
for
me
i
did
it
for
the
sake
of
thora
i
gave
her
up
to
you
that
you
might
love
her
and
cherish
her
and
make
her
happy
and
be
a
better
husband
to
her
than
i
could
be
but
if
you
don
t
do
it
if
you
ever
neglect
her
or
desert
her
or
give
her
up
for
another
woman
i
ll
take
her
back
do
you
hear
me
magnus
swayed
like
a
drunken
man
and
laid
hold
of
oscar
s
arm
i
ll
take
her
back
and
then
then
by
god
i
ll
kill
you
saying
this
he
walked
heavily
out
of
the
house
leaving
oscar
with
white
cheeks
and
gibbering
lips
alone
in
the
hall
his
ponies
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
street
ready
for
the
journey
to
thingvellir
the
night
was
dark
but
the
windows
of
the
house
were
bright
for
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
and
the
sashes
thrown
open
a
cackle
of
many
voices
came
out
of
them
for
the
company
within
was
now
large
and
very
merry
while
magnus
tightened
the
girths
somebody
played
a
guitar
and
as
he
was
riding
away
oscar
began
to
sing
pieces
of
the
game
he
this
of
nights
and
days
and
thither
moves
and
checks
and
slays
one
by
one
back
in
the
closet
oscar
did
his
best
to
keep
the
fire
burning
in
the
inner
sanctuary
the
fire
of
love
and
duty
but
oftener
than
he
was
aware
it
flickered
and
seemed
to
be
in
danger
of
dying
out
he
tried
to
tell
the
truth
about
magnus
but
as
frequently
as
he
thought
out
a
way
of
doing
so
he
was
confronted
by
the
ugly
question
which
would
surely
be
asked
can
it
be
possible
that
you
stood
passively
aside
while
we
condemned
magnus
for
a
vice
he
was
not
guilty
of
and
praised
you
for
a
virtue
you
did
not
possess
the
humiliation
of
speech
like
that
would
be
deeper
than
the
degradation
of
silence
and
from
day
to
day
oscar
postponed
the
painful
confession
thus
a
month
passed
and
he
had
said
nothing
his
position
would
have
been
easier
if
he
had
been
getting
on
better
with
his
work
if
he
could
have
felt
it
impossible
that
the
factor
could
regret
the
loss
of
magnus
then
he
would
have
said
after
all
though
naturally
you
didn
t
think
so
at
the
time
everything
has
been
for
the
best
whereupon
the
factor
would
have
said
you
are
right
and
after
that
he
would
have
told
all
but
his
work
was
going
badly
and
there
was
no
blinking
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poor
business
man
on
first
going
into
the
factor
s
on
the
footing
the
contract
gave
him
he
rambled
from
office
to
warehouse
with
aimless
and
shiftless
uncertainty
dressed
with
bohemian
freedom
and
looking
like
a
butterfly
in
a
back
alley
then
the
factor
said
come
come
young
fellow
we
must
be
getting
to
work
choose
a
department
and
be
responsible
for
it
oscar
selected
the
export
department
this
brought
him
into
relation
with
the
farmers
and
some
of
them
cheated
him
unmercifully
concealing
their
inferior
wool
in
the
body
of
the
packs
he
bought
from
them
magnus
would
have
rooted
out
both
the
bad
stuff
and
the
men
who
brought
it
and
they
would
have
gone
flying
before
his
threatening
face
but
oscar
wished
to
stand
well
with
everybody
and
the
firm
suffered
accordingly
after
a
week
he
wished
to
change
he
thought
the
import
department
would
suit
him
better
very
well
said
the
factor
mistakes
are
made
by
the
young
as
well
as
the
old
buckle
to
at
the
imports
my
boy
the
imports
brought
him
into
relation
with
the
mates
of
steamers
and
trading
ships
and
they
were
quick
to
shuffle
their
responsibility
for
damaged
freights
onto
oscar
s
shoulders
after
another
week
he
went
back
to
the
factor
and
said
i
don
t
think
a
department
is
what
suits
me
best
why
not
let
me
have
a
general
supervision
the
factor
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
replied
i
m
willing
you
shall
be
my
man
then
and
i
ll
ease
off
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
but
from
that
moment
onward
oscar
did
nothing
good
bad
or
indifferent
he
was
always
running
about
like
one
out
of
breath
but
he
came
at
any
hour
in
the
morning
and
left
at
any
time
in
the
evening
and
was
always
skipping
off
to
see
thora
that
little
lady
was
entirely
content
but
the
factor
was
heard
to
say
to
aunt
margret
there
was
something
in
magnus
after
all
margret
and
aunt
margret
was
heard
to
answer
many
a
good
sword
is
in
a
bad
sheath
you
know
but
one
day
oscar
came
flying
to
the
factor
in
breathless
haste
with
his
mouth
full
of
great
news
the
member
of
parliament
for
the
town
was
dead
and
the
radical
party
were
already
preparing
to
run
a
candidate
an
socialist
named
oddsson
an
enemy
of
the
old
order
in
both
politics
and
trade
why
shouldn
t
i
go
into
althing
said
oscar
i
could
protect
the
business
against
these
rascally
revolutionaries
and
help
to
preserve
the
old
principles
let
me
talk
to
your
father
first
said
the
factor
the
old
friends
agreed
that
the
scheme
was
a
good
one
not
only
was
the
man
oddsson
a
believer
in
magnus
s
doctrine
about
the
barter
trade
but
he
was
the
champion
of
an
agitation
for
establishing
a
new
constitution
in
iceland
which
would
abolish
the
governor
and
set
up
a
minister
responsible
to
parliament
alone
he
must
be
kept
out
in
they
must
fight
the
common
enemy
oscar
would
be
a
good
candidate
being
young
and
bright
and
clever
and
a
personal
favorite
but
i
can
not
appear
in
the
contest
said
the
governor
leave
it
to
me
said
the
factor
and
he
went
back
and
told
oscar
who
shouted
with
delight
and
shot
off
to
tell
thora
by
this
time
thora
had
spent
a
long
month
in
radiant
happiness
if
she
thought
sometimes
of
magnus
s
position
she
remembered
that
oscar
had
said
he
would
set
things
right
and
the
delay
counted
for
little
because
she
measured
existence
by
days
no
longer
but
by
emotions
and
she
was
conscious
of
one
emotion
only
love
for
oscar
and
therefore
for
everybody
and
everything
in
the
world
as
the
year
was
growing
elderly
and
its
withering
winds
made
further
excursions
to
the
islands
of
the
fiord
impossible
they
remained
at
home
and
romped
like
children
or
played
the
guitar
and
piano
at
such
times
thora
was
not
without
certain
backward
thoughts
of
magnus
for
the
room
was
the
same
and
nothing
was
different
except
the
hour
of
the
day
but
there
was
always
the
difference
of
its
being
oscar
he
taught
her
some
icelandic
love
songs
and
she
sang
them
in
a
thin
sweet
treble
which
oscar
cheered
tumultuously
it
did
not
hurt
her
in
the
least
that
oscar
never
took
her
singing
seriously
he
did
not
take
thora
herself
seriously
he
called
her
baby
thora
and
she
christened
him
the
bad
boy
the
moment
he
had
left
her
sight
she
would
send
a
letter
after
him
like
a
handkerchief
he
had
forgotten
he
always
replied
and
his
letters
were
full
of
affectionate
banter
but
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
was
a
little
disappointed
with
them
they
were
not
quite
enough
there
were
scarcely
any
of
them
she
could
not
read
aloud
to
aunt
margret
there
was
hardly
one
that
was
her
very
own
but
oscar
made
up
for
every
deficiency
when
he
arrived
himself
and
on
the
day
when
he
came
with
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
into
the
and
announced
that
he
was
to
be
member
of
althing
she
saw
him
for
one
moment
great
and
glorious
like
the
top
of
a
mountain
when
it
has
broken
through
the
mist
and
the
sun
has
flashed
on
to
it
and
then
she
said
and
now
the
bad
boy
must
play
with
me
he
hasn
t
played
me
blindman
s
buff
since
yesterday
thora
was
too
happy
to
think
of
her
happiness
but
she
told
herself
sometimes
that
there
was
only
one
thing
wanted
to
make
it
complete
that
helga
should
come
home
to
share
it
she
broached
the
subject
to
oscar
but
it
was
at
a
moment
when
he
was
immersed
in
his
manifestoes
and
he
merely
said
good
idea
splendid
helga
looks
like
a
stunner
send
for
her
certainly
if
the
factor
approves
and
he
went
on
with
his
tiresome
politics
she
broached
it
next
to
aunt
margret
who
was
less
encouraging
putting
her
spectacled
face
close
to
thora
s
she
shook
her
ringlets
and
said
don
t
be
a
ninny
two
s
company
three
s
none
but
thora
mentioned
the
matter
to
anna
also
and
the
motherly
old
thing
was
moved
that
would
be
beautiful
if
you
could
manage
it
thora
she
said
and
if
it
should
lead
to
bringing
the
others
together
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
after
that
thora
regarded
herself
in
the
light
of
the
family
and
in
this
character
she
approached
her
father
the
factor
listened
to
her
with
sympathy
for
nature
is
stronger
than
lawyer
s
ink
and
he
had
often
told
himself
he
had
been
foolish
to
part
with
his
child
well
i
don
t
see
why
she
shouldn
t
he
said
she
might
come
for
the
wedding
or
say
for
a
year
one
year
at
all
events
i
ll
write
to
the
lawyer
in
denmark
by
the
same
mail
thora
wrote
to
helga
dearest
helga
father
is
writing
to
the
lawyer
to
ask
him
to
send
you
back
to
iceland
it
is
only
for
a
year
so
i
hope
mamma
will
not
object
i
am
sure
you
will
not
when
i
tell
you
what
is
to
happen
there
is
to
be
a
wedding
and
of
course
a
party
and
great
goings
on
dear
i
am
to
be
married
to
oscar
stephenson
who
has
come
back
from
england
and
is
so
handsome
and
so
clever
if
you
could
see
him
as
he
is
now
you
would
fall
in
love
with
him
instantly
but
he
is
so
fond
of
me
and
i
am
so
happy
i
was
to
have
married
his
brother
magnus
but
the
engagement
broke
down
and
now
i
am
very
sorry
for
magnus
and
if
ever
you
hear
anything
against
him
when
you
come
home
you
are
not
to
believe
a
word
of
it
because
magnus
is
as
good
as
gold
only
i
could
not
care
for
him
so
it
was
no
use
trying
dear
there
are
such
lots
of
things
i
want
to
tell
you
but
i
must
save
them
until
you
come
we
have
had
bad
trade
this
summer
and
oscar
has
gone
into
father
s
business
i
am
weaving
a
web
of
cloth
for
father
s
christmas
suit
but
it
does
not
make
much
progress
because
somebody
is
always
interrupting
and
when
you
are
about
to
be
married
there
is
so
much
to
do
isn
t
there
dearest
helga
i
have
no
more
to
write
about
now
so
give
my
love
to
mamma
and
mind
you
come
before
long
for
the
wedding
may
be
soon
although
nothing
is
fixed
yet
your
affectionate
sister
thora
come
quickly
i
am
dying
to
introduce
you
to
oscar
a
fortnight
later
the
factor
announced
that
he
had
heard
from
the
lawyer
in
denmark
and
helga
was
to
come
by
the
next
steamer
the
laura
and
she
s
due
on
the
first
of
november
and
that
s
the
day
of
the
election
said
oscar
what
a
good
omen
said
thora
and
she
sang
her
iceland
love
songs
all
that
evening
through
for
she
was
very
happy
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
laura
was
due
there
was
no
sign
of
her
on
the
sea
but
that
was
a
matter
of
moment
only
to
thora
who
had
been
up
early
and
down
at
the
jetty
before
breakfast
the
rest
of
the
little
world
in
which
she
lived
were
immersed
in
preparations
for
the
election
and
were
going
about
like
dogs
on
the
leash
before
the
hunt
begins
oscar
was
flying
to
and
fro
with
red
ribbons
in
his
ponies
were
coming
and
going
with
red
ribbons
in
their
bridles
and
red
flags
were
hanging
all
over
the
town
but
nevertheless
there
was
a
sense
of
uncertainty
everywhere
and
an
atmosphere
of
intense
excitement
the
day
opened
dull
and
rayless
with
a
pale
sun
behind
a
slaty
sky
like
a
white
wafer
on
an
old
parchment
an
hour
before
the
polling
booths
opened
the
governor
called
upon
the
factor
under
pretense
of
his
morning
s
walk
and
said
i
m
doubtful
of
the
result
neilsen
and
i
now
see
that
oscar
was
the
worst
possible
candidate
to
stand
for
our
cause
everybody
who
has
a
grievance
against
the
governor
is
going
to
vote
against
the
governor
s
son
and
everybody
who
has
a
grievance
against
the
factor
will
vote
against
his
oh
i
know
the
people
bless
them
said
the
factor
master
when
you
want
anything
slave
when
you
don
t
but
we
ll
see
stephen
we
ll
see
after
finishing
his
breakfast
comfortably
the
factor
walked
leisurely
to
his
and
called
for
his
ledger
it
showed
that
nearly
half
of
the
electors
of
the
town
were
indebted
to
him
some
of
them
slightly
others
deeply
and
not
a
few
beyond
hope
of
payment
without
pressure
or
distraint
he
counted
up
their
total
indebtedness
and
it
proved
to
be
frightful
but
life
is
precious
when
death
is
at
the
door
he
thought
and
lighting
his
long
german
pipe
he
put
the
book
under
his
arm
and
strolled
quietly
across
to
the
as
chairman
of
oscar
s
committee
the
factor
had
a
right
to
sit
inside
the
polling
booth
but
he
merely
asked
to
be
allowed
to
take
a
chair
outside
the
counter
to
which
the
voters
would
come
up
when
they
recorded
their
votes
a
low
seat
is
often
easy
he
said
sitting
with
his
face
to
the
sheriff
and
his
back
to
the
door
when
the
doors
were
opened
the
factor
laid
his
ledger
across
his
knees
and
took
out
a
thick
blue
pencil
then
as
each
voter
came
up
to
the
counter
and
his
name
was
called
and
looked
up
in
the
register
the
factor
was
seen
to
turn
up
the
voter
s
account
in
his
own
book
and
hold
his
blue
pencil
over
it
whom
do
you
vote
for
asked
the
sheriff
oscar
stephenson
or
jon
oddsson
and
if
the
voter
answered
oscar
stephenson
the
blue
pencil
was
seen
to
descend
in
two
broad
strokes
across
the
account
as
if
cancelling
it
altogether
but
if
he
answered
jon
oddsson
it
was
seen
to
score
the
total
with
a
double
underline
as
if
marking
it
for
immediate
recovery
the
opposition
had
entered
in
hot
haste
but
the
effect
was
instantaneous
a
voter
would
come
swaggering
up
to
the
counter
call
his
name
in
a
robustious
voice
and
then
while
waiting
for
the
verification
of
his
right
to
vote
see
the
factor
sitting
below
with
his
own
account
open
before
him
and
understanding
everything
in
a
moment
would
begin
to
answer
the
sheriff
with
a
faltering
odd
then
pause
tremble
mumble
stephenson
and
go
stumbling
out
of
doors
silently
hour
after
hour
from
the
beginning
of
the
day
to
the
end
of
it
the
factor
sat
at
his
task
never
once
looking
up
from
his
ledger
and
apparently
doing
nothing
but
checking
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
the
sheriff
s
record
of
the
votes
aunt
margret
came
to
say
that
dinner
was
ready
but
he
answered
that
he
was
not
hungry
toward
three
in
the
afternoon
thora
arrived
in
great
excitement
to
say
that
the
laura
had
been
sighted
outside
the
head
but
he
told
her
to
meet
her
sister
herself
and
tell
her
that
he
did
not
expect
to
be
home
before
midnight
when
the
cathedral
clock
struck
four
the
sheriff
rose
and
ordered
the
shutting
of
the
doors
the
short
winter
s
day
had
closed
in
by
this
time
and
while
the
counting
was
going
on
with
its
monotonous
beat
in
the
silence
of
the
breathless
room
like
the
splashing
of
rain
on
the
pavement
stephenson
stephenson
oddsson
stephenson
the
factor
who
had
lit
his
pipe
was
pacing
the
corridor
outside
like
a
man
who
walks
in
his
orchard
when
the
fruit
is
ripe
when
the
counting
was
finished
the
sheriff
told
the
attendants
to
open
the
window
and
then
the
deep
hum
of
a
crowd
which
had
been
cheering
and
singing
outside
with
a
noise
like
the
waves
breaking
on
a
bar
far
off
rose
to
a
roar
like
that
of
the
sea
running
up
a
stony
beach
at
the
next
moment
everybody
was
shaking
hands
with
oscar
a
band
was
beginning
to
play
in
the
street
and
the
sheriff
was
stepping
on
to
the
balcony
meantime
thora
fluttering
with
excitement
of
another
sort
had
gone
down
to
the
jetty
to
meet
helga
as
soon
as
the
laura
had
steamed
up
the
fiord
and
cast
anchor
outside
the
town
she
put
off
in
her
father
s
white
boat
and
drew
up
alongside
it
was
now
quite
dark
but
lights
were
burning
on
the
steamer
and
the
dark
figures
of
a
line
of
passengers
were
silhouetted
against
the
sky
as
they
leaned
over
the
rail
and
shouted
to
the
friends
in
little
boats
who
had
come
out
to
meet
them
thora
was
sure
that
helga
must
be
there
and
she
wanted
to
call
to
her
but
her
heart
was
beating
so
fast
that
her
voice
would
not
answer
at
length
the
ladder
was
let
down
and
thora
s
boat
swayed
up
to
it
and
then
she
climbed
up
the
steamer
s
side
helga
miss
helga
is
below
said
a
voice
out
of
the
darkness
and
though
she
felt
a
pang
of
disappointment
that
helga
was
not
waiting
she
ran
down
the
stairs
to
the
saloon
at
the
bottom
she
called
helga
again
and
the
stewardess
said
the
young
lady
is
in
her
cabin
which
second
to
the
left
feeling
conscious
of
increasing
disappointment
but
still
panting
in
her
eagerness
thora
skipped
off
to
the
cabin
and
then
came
a
shock
of
surprise
somehow
she
had
expected
to
find
helga
a
little
thing
grown
certainly
but
still
smaller
than
herself
in
her
dreams
of
their
first
meeting
she
had
pictured
herself
stooping
to
kiss
helga
and
then
in
a
sort
of
way
putting
her
arms
about
her
waist
but
the
young
lady
who
came
leisurely
out
of
the
cabin
with
her
veil
down
and
buttoning
her
kid
gloves
was
much
taller
than
thora
and
quite
dignified
and
stately
thora
said
the
girl
so
it
is
you
really
you
said
thora
really
me
laughed
helga
and
then
it
was
helga
who
stooped
to
kiss
thora
who
had
to
lift
up
her
face
to
her
thora
s
heart
was
in
her
mouth
in
both
senses
she
looked
at
helga
again
by
the
dim
light
of
the
saloon
lamp
and
felt
herself
small
and
insignificant
helga
was
beautiful
with
fine
features
large
gray
eyes
and
rich
dark
complexion
and
thora
felt
herself
to
be
plain
and
commonplace
helga
was
fashionably
dressed
in
the
danish
manner
with
the
soft
silk
things
about
the
neck
and
bosom
which
give
charm
to
a
charming
girl
and
thora
felt
herself
to
be
dowdy
and
countrified
in
her
iceland
hufa
and
stiff
velvet
cloak
have
you
come
alone
asked
helga
quite
alone
said
thora
but
hasn
t
father
come
with
you
or
aunt
margret
or
that
wonderful
oscar
is
there
nobody
but
you
nobody
but
me
said
thora
and
then
though
she
felt
crushed
and
small
she
delivered
the
factor
s
message
and
told
about
the
election
so
that
was
the
meaning
of
the
band
we
heard
as
we
were
sailing
up
said
helga
and
at
the
first
moment
thora
thought
perhaps
helga
had
hoped
it
was
in
honor
of
her
own
arrival
but
at
the
next
she
felt
ashamed
and
foolish
we
might
as
well
go
then
said
helga
and
she
swept
up
the
stairs
leaving
thora
to
follow
it
was
all
so
different
from
what
thora
had
expected
so
utterly
different
that
she
would
have
given
anything
to
run
away
and
cry
but
going
ashore
in
the
boat
she
sat
at
the
helm
side
by
side
with
helga
and
there
the
lights
being
gone
and
thora
no
longer
in
awe
of
helga
s
fashion
and
beauty
she
slipped
her
arm
about
her
sister
s
waist
as
she
had
always
intended
to
do
and
after
that
they
got
on
better
when
they
touched
the
jetty
there
was
much
shouting
and
scrambling
in
the
darkness
and
thora
was
nervous
and
excited
but
helga
was
quiet
and
even
amused
no
carriages
in
this
benighted
country
yet
i
suppose
said
helga
no
but
i
ve
brought
silvertop
to
take
you
up
said
thora
and
what
is
there
for
you
oh
i
ll
walk
i
love
walking
the
street
at
the
top
of
the
jetty
was
thronged
with
the
people
who
were
waiting
outside
the
polling
place
to
hear
the
result
of
the
election
and
when
the
girls
came
to
the
crowd
which
was
but
boisterous
they
found
it
difficult
to
plow
their
way
through
until
a
big
man
stepped
before
them
and
swept
the
people
aside
like
ninepins
what
a
tremendous
creature
that
was
said
helga
he
could
have
felled
an
ox
i
fancy
but
didn
t
you
know
him
helga
it
was
magnus
stephenson
said
thora
magnus
why
didn
t
he
speak
i
wonder
they
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
were
crossing
in
front
of
the
polling
place
when
the
people
raised
a
great
shout
for
it
was
the
moment
when
the
sheriff
stepped
on
to
the
balcony
he
s
going
to
declare
the
poll
shall
we
wait
asked
thora
it
might
be
amusing
said
helga
as
soon
as
there
was
silence
the
sheriff
read
the
figures
oscar
had
been
elected
by
three
votes
to
one
at
this
there
was
another
hurricane
of
cheers
with
cries
of
oscar
oscar
and
thora
said
oscar
will
come
next
shall
we
wait
and
see
him
why
not
it
will
be
good
fun
said
helga
and
in
the
interval
thora
patted
silvertop
to
keep
him
quiet
and
creeping
closer
to
her
sister
squeezed
her
hand
then
oscar
came
bounding
on
to
the
balcony
amidst
a
wild
breaker
of
applause
and
behind
him
came
two
men
bearing
torches
so
that
his
figure
and
face
were
plainly
visible
to
the
crowd
below
his
slight
lithe
form
his
fair
hair
slightly
ruffled
his
sparkling
eyes
his
mobile
mouth
and
the
smile
that
captivated
everybody
it
was
thus
that
helga
saw
him
for
the
first
time
since
he
became
a
man
and
her
face
which
had
worn
a
playful
expression
became
grave
how
fine
she
said
thora
could
hardly
catch
the
words
over
the
sibilation
of
the
running
cheers
but
she
said
he
will
speak
shall
we
wait
to
hear
him
assuredly
said
helga
and
when
oscar
began
with
fellow
townsmen
and
fellow
countrymen
thora
felt
helga
s
hand
shiver
and
heard
her
say
the
same
voice
oscar
s
speech
was
punctuated
by
applause
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
and
when
it
was
finished
and
the
speaker
and
the
men
with
the
torches
had
disappeared
thora
spoke
to
helga
again
but
she
answered
at
random
and
sat
in
her
saddle
like
one
in
a
dream
somebody
else
came
on
to
the
balcony
and
had
a
mixed
reception
it
must
be
father
said
thora
and
then
the
factor
s
voice
utterly
indifferent
to
hostile
interruptions
was
heard
to
say
that
a
supper
had
been
prepared
at
the
hotel
for
the
committee
of
the
successful
candidate
and
they
were
to
go
there
at
once
the
new
member
would
follow
presently
with
that
the
crowd
broke
up
and
the
girls
went
their
way
thora
clinging
closer
than
ever
to
her
sister
for
her
heart
was
warm
with
love
and
pride
well
she
said
what
did
you
think
of
him
think
of
him
oscar
said
helga
she
laughed
uncomfortably
and
then
stooped
from
the
saddle
and
whispered
only
to
think
that
a
little
thing
like
you
dear
should
capture
a
man
like
that
thora
laughed
also
but
she
hardly
knew
whether
she
was
pleased
or
hurt
a
sudden
chill
had
struck
her
it
was
like
the
breath
of
the
mountain
snow
which
sometimes
comes
down
in
summer
the
gods
of
riot
were
playing
so
hard
a
game
with
thora
that
she
was
in
a
fever
to
introduce
oscar
to
helga
and
when
he
did
not
appear
by
noon
of
the
following
day
she
sent
a
letter
across
to
government
house
to
order
him
to
come
forthwith
the
bad
boy
was
too
full
of
his
silly
politics
while
there
was
something
far
more
charming
and
absorbing
waiting
for
him
there
but
an
answer
came
back
from
anna
to
say
that
oscar
was
still
asleep
and
after
the
excitement
of
the
day
before
and
the
late
hour
of
the
previous
night
she
was
unwilling
to
waken
him
early
in
the
afternoon
anna
herself
came
over
expecting
to
see
the
of
the
and
while
aunt
margret
was
below
stairs
preparing
chocolate
for
the
company
that
was
expected
the
motherly
old
thing
tried
various
artful
ways
of
finding
out
from
helga
what
her
upbringing
had
been
in
denmark
and
particularly
what
religious
instruction
and
society
her
mother
had
given
her
helga
saw
through
the
device
in
a
moment
and
with
her
red
lips
a
little
awry
she
painted
an
alarming
picture
of
theaters
and
and
a
flat
in
copenhagen
frequented
by
actors
and
actresses
especially
on
sunday
evenings
where
everybody
including
the
ladies
smoked
cigarettes
and
drank
brandy
meanwhile
thora
watched
for
oscar
out
of
the
sidelight
of
the
projecting
window
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
swinging
down
the
road
she
darted
into
the
hall
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
kissed
him
whereupon
with
his
head
full
of
his
victory
he
said
congratulations
eh
the
sweetest
i
ve
had
yet
and
pushed
through
toward
the
wait
wait
wait
somebody
to
show
you
cried
thora
then
the
poor
victim
of
god
knows
what
maleficent
powers
not
knowing
what
she
did
but
laughing
merrily
as
if
a
had
been
imprisoned
in
her
throat
began
to
play
the
old
familiar
trick
of
children
standing
behind
oscar
on
in
order
to
reach
she
put
her
hands
over
his
eyes
and
crying
forward
soldier
marched
him
blindfold
into
the
and
up
to
the
place
where
helga
was
waiting
then
removing
her
hands
sharply
she
cried
there
and
stood
off
to
see
the
effect
oscar
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
girl
as
unlike
thora
as
could
be
tall
dark
with
hair
parted
at
the
side
and
hanging
over
the
forehead
dressed
in
a
light
silk
blouse
and
skirt
and
having
an
odor
of
violets
about
her
helga
can
it
be
possible
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
helga
took
it
and
held
it
and
so
they
stood
for
some
moments
while
thora
breathing
rapidly
watched
the
changing
lights
in
their
faces
in
oscar
s
astonishment
admiration
and
rapture
in
helga
s
curiosity
satisfaction
and
delight
and
thora
s
own
face
too
to
the
pitying
angels
who
alone
were
looking
at
it
showed
expressions
just
as
various
pride
joy
then
uneasiness
and
finally
a
little
twinge
of
secret
pain
to
relieve
this
feeling
thora
burst
into
laughter
and
then
everybody
laughed
and
aunt
margret
came
into
the
room
with
the
chocolate
and
cakes
so
you
ve
brought
them
together
again
thora
said
aunt
margret
and
thora
swallowed
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
answered
yes
then
oscar
and
helga
went
over
to
the
window
and
talked
together
with
great
animation
thora
heard
snatches
of
their
conversation
as
she
carried
round
the
cups
it
was
about
things
of
which
she
knew
nothing
denmark
copenhagen
england
london
oxford
the
english
theater
the
danish
theater
and
above
all
music
music
music
how
well
they
get
along
said
thora
trust
them
for
that
said
aunt
margret
toward
dusk
the
factor
returned
home
not
having
altered
his
habit
of
work
by
a
hair
s
breadth
and
then
came
half
the
great
people
of
the
town
the
bishop
the
sheriff
the
rector
of
the
latin
school
and
finally
the
governor
helga
moved
among
them
with
the
quiet
ease
of
one
accustomed
to
company
within
an
hour
she
had
captured
all
the
men
but
the
women
were
less
sure
of
her
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
her
whispered
aunt
margret
to
anna
i
said
to
myself
thora
is
a
neilsen
out
and
out
but
there
s
more
of
the
stranger
in
this
she
s
the
living
picture
of
what
my
wife
was
when
i
saw
her
first
said
the
factor
in
a
low
tone
to
the
governor
who
answered
significantly
in
the
same
low
tone
then
i
don
t
wonder
old
friend
i
say
i
don
t
wonder
helga
s
head
and
yours
were
nearer
together
when
i
laid
my
hand
on
them
last
said
the
bishop
to
thora
take
care
your
sister
is
running
away
from
you
little
one
isn
t
she
said
thora
thora
did
not
feel
quite
so
happy
in
helga
s
visit
as
she
had
expected
but
still
struggling
to
show
her
off
she
asked
her
to
play
something
on
the
piano
she
had
played
after
breakfast
and
it
was
beautiful
helga
played
brilliantly
and
oscar
who
turned
over
her
music
applauded
her
boisterously
and
now
oscar
ought
to
play
something
said
the
governor
from
his
earliest
years
he
made
us
conceive
the
highest
hopes
that
he
might
become
a
great
musician
he
will
too
my
son
neils
at
the
college
of
music
says
he
will
said
the
sheriff
nonsense
said
the
factor
oscar
has
something
better
to
do
now
than
to
scrape
catgut
or
blow
his
lungs
through
a
still
an
occasional
flirtation
with
the
muses
said
the
hector
you
wouldn
t
object
to
that
factor
i
would
object
to
flirtations
of
all
sorts
said
the
factor
and
i
should
think
the
man
a
fool
who
put
himself
in
the
way
of
them
surprising
how
many
men
do
said
the
governor
with
a
wink
at
the
rector
would
you
believe
it
a
certain
friend
of
yours
wrote
a
poem
in
the
days
of
his
youth
never
cried
the
rector
and
while
the
old
people
laughed
the
factor
said
when
i
was
a
child
i
behaved
as
a
child
but
when
i
became
a
man
i
put
away
childish
things
well
i
so
far
agree
with
the
factor
that
i
think
a
man
can
t
have
his
heart
in
two
places
at
once
said
the
governor
what
do
you
say
thora
i
suppose
not
said
thora
certainly
not
any
more
than
a
man
can
love
two
women
at
the
same
time
said
the
governor
and
then
oscar
began
to
play
he
played
as
the
bird
sings
because
the
song
is
in
the
soul
of
it
and
when
he
had
finished
the
company
cheered
him
lustily
and
helga
putting
her
face
close
to
his
said
in
a
whisper
and
you
asked
me
to
play
i
who
only
play
as
i
am
taught
and
you
can
play
like
that
oscar
was
delighted
with
helga
s
praises
and
suggested
that
they
should
play
together
they
played
a
difficult
selection
full
of
flourishes
and
the
company
declared
they
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
wonderful
wasn
t
it
said
somebody
yes
wasn
t
it
said
thora
she
was
feeling
utterly
eclipsed
and
forgotten
when
helga
wheeled
round
on
the
and
said
and
now
thora
must
give
us
something
on
her
guitar
aunt
margret
says
she
plays
it
beautifully
indeed
she
does
beautifully
said
aunt
margret
but
thora
begged
off
in
alarm
saying
no
indeed
no
i
couldn
t
possibly
play
after
playing
like
that
so
oscar
and
helga
began
again
this
time
it
was
an
english
ballad
helga
played
the
accompaniment
and
oscar
sang
the
air
and
there
was
a
chorus
which
they
gave
together
the
company
were
completely
carried
away
charming
exquisite
but
how
well
their
voices
harmonize
they
might
have
been
meant
by
nature
to
go
together
might
they
not
said
thora
but
now
thora
ought
really
to
play
her
guitar
said
helga
certainly
thora
and
her
guitar
said
oscar
and
let
her
sing
one
of
her
iceland
love
songs
to
it
it
was
cruel
it
was
it
was
almost
as
if
helga
were
trying
to
humiliate
her
as
if
oscar
were
joining
her
as
if
they
were
conspiring
together
to
expose
her
inferiority
no
no
don
t
ask
me
please
don
t
she
pleaded
but
helga
continued
to
ask
and
oscar
to
second
her
and
being
able
to
bear
the
strain
no
longer
thora
burst
into
tears
and
fled
from
the
room
how
extraordinary
said
helga
but
oscar
followed
thora
and
coaxed
and
comforted
her
and
brought
her
back
with
a
smile
on
her
face
although
the
tears
were
scarcely
dry
in
her
eyes
i
was
silly
she
said
i
don
t
know
what
came
over
me
perhaps
it
was
the
heat
said
the
governor
and
he
opened
one
of
the
windows
during
the
next
month
oscar
was
every
day
and
nearly
all
day
at
the
factor
s
to
the
total
disregard
of
his
public
work
and
the
complete
neglect
of
business
but
his
visits
were
not
always
to
thora
who
was
ceasing
to
be
baby
thora
either
to
him
or
to
any
one
and
becoming
a
serious
little
figure
with
a
wistful
face
she
never
romped
about
the
house
now
but
sat
in
a
corner
with
a
ball
of
wool
in
her
lap
and
a
crochet
hook
in
her
hand
while
oscar
and
helga
played
the
piano
and
talked
music
it
was
music
music
always
music
at
the
factor
s
in
those
days
early
in
her
visit
helga
brought
down
a
pile
of
the
music
of
wagner
and
oscar
was
completely
carried
away
by
it
other
composers
produced
beautiful
harmonies
a
subtle
and
clever
combination
of
sweet
sounds
but
when
oscar
played
wagner
the
piano
seemed
to
him
to
waken
and
weep
to
burn
the
flame
under
his
fingers
it
s
glorious
he
would
say
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
helga
it
s
a
new
world
a
new
revelation
helga
had
heard
of
oscar
s
songs
from
the
sagas
and
one
day
she
said
i
wonder
you
don
t
try
to
compose
something
yourself
oscar
something
in
the
style
of
wagner
i
m
sure
you
could
then
with
diffidence
and
apologies
oscar
produced
his
prentice
efforts
and
helga
praised
them
enthusiastically
do
you
know
you
are
a
born
musician
she
said
and
you
should
never
do
anything
except
create
music
never
oscar
was
intoxicated
by
her
applause
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
ah
that
s
impossible
why
impossible
parliament
public
duties
and
so
forth
but
my
dear
oscar
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
waste
your
life
like
that
do
you
call
it
waste
helga
not
for
everybody
not
for
a
man
like
magnus
for
example
but
for
you
yes
said
helga
and
then
with
irresistible
drollery
she
mimicked
the
manners
of
parliament
with
its
speaker
permit
me
to
rise
to
a
point
of
order
and
will
the
honorable
and
learned
member
explain
and
all
the
other
inanities
of
a
legislative
assembly
in
a
little
country
oscar
laughed
until
tears
from
more
springs
than
one
began
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
and
then
he
said
what
an
actress
you
would
make
helga
but
principles
my
dear
girl
principles
are
the
soul
of
politics
and
if
a
man
can
guide
his
country
in
the
higher
paths
he
can
afford
to
forget
the
plains
don
t
you
think
so
thora
and
thora
who
had
been
feeling
dizzy
and
faint
answered
in
a
helpless
way
yes
oscar
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
father
wished
to
see
you
on
business
business
cried
helga
that
too
then
you
object
to
business
also
asked
oscar
for
you
certainly
because
you
are
not
fit
for
it
said
helga
and
if
you
go
into
business
you
ll
be
like
a
man
who
has
married
the
wrong
woman
she
may
be
an
excellent
thrifty
soul
quite
suitable
to
somebody
else
but
she
was
never
meant
for
him
there
s
something
in
that
though
it
s
wonderful
how
you
know
it
said
oscar
i
m
about
the
silliest
beggar
at
a
bargain
that
ever
breathed
out
of
an
oyster
shell
of
course
you
are
oscar
you
must
be
now
if
magnus
had
gone
into
business
he
might
have
got
something
out
of
it
but
you
what
in
the
world
do
you
expect
to
get
ah
now
you
re
wrong
helga
i
have
got
something
out
of
it
already
i
ve
got
thora
thora
didn
t
you
know
thora
was
the
prize
i
was
bidding
for
when
i
took
over
that
contract
so
that
was
it
was
it
said
helga
and
then
thora
herself
feeling
sick
and
ill
gathered
up
her
work
and
stole
out
of
the
room
nevertheless
the
seed
which
helga
had
sown
had
not
fallen
on
stony
ground
within
hours
oscar
appeared
with
a
new
composition
in
his
hands
an
idea
came
to
me
last
night
and
i
had
to
get
it
off
he
said
and
then
he
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
played
beautiful
cried
helga
really
beautiful
but
this
subject
suggests
the
organ
why
not
set
it
to
that
and
try
it
on
the
organ
in
the
cathedral
splendid
idea
said
oscar
thora
knows
the
curator
and
can
get
the
key
what
do
you
say
thora
if
you
would
like
to
said
thora
and
next
day
they
carried
out
their
scheme
oscar
and
helga
sat
together
in
the
organ
loft
while
thora
was
sent
down
the
communion
steps
to
report
the
effect
at
a
distance
how
did
that
go
thora
cried
oscar
once
or
twice
at
the
beginning
and
thora
answered
very
nicely
i
think
but
then
the
two
in
the
organ
loft
forgot
her
altogether
in
the
rapture
of
their
rehearsal
during
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
oscar
and
helga
went
to
the
cathedral
every
day
and
sometimes
thora
went
with
them
but
more
frequently
she
remained
at
home
a
sudden
wave
of
energy
seemed
to
lift
oscar
out
of
himself
and
he
produced
one
composition
after
another
helga
applauded
all
of
them
and
her
praises
intoxicated
him
like
glory
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
you
helga
he
said
for
all
the
good
things
you
have
poured
out
on
me
since
you
came
back
to
iceland
you
have
given
my
life
a
new
joy
a
new
splendor
nonsense
said
helga
i
am
nothing
but
a
voice
to
awaken
your
genius
you
were
born
to
create
music
and
whatever
happens
you
must
never
never
throw
away
a
life
which
has
the
glory
of
a
future
like
that
to
this
and
such
as
this
he
always
answered
ah
no
or
impossible
or
it
s
past
praying
for
but
helga
s
words
were
as
the
very
incense
of
the
dreams
which
in
vaguer
forms
he
had
been
trying
to
forget
since
the
day
he
engaged
himself
to
thora
why
shouldn
t
there
be
another
wagner
an
icelandic
wagner
a
wagner
with
a
still
grander
scene
and
still
greater
stories
the
sagas
and
eddas
of
this
stern
old
land
about
a
month
after
helga
returned
to
iceland
she
suggested
to
oscar
that
he
should
write
an
anthem
on
a
passage
which
she
selected
from
one
of
the
sagas
it
was
that
in
which
the
old
gods
of
the
pagan
world
in
anger
with
the
family
of
man
for
permitting
the
establishment
of
christianity
tore
open
the
bowels
of
their
fruitful
valleys
with
earthquakes
and
deluged
them
with
molten
lava
and
how
christ
came
through
the
chaos
saying
let
there
be
peace
great
glorious
a
stunning
subject
but
can
i
do
it
said
oscar
you
can
you
must
said
helga
and
from
that
moment
a
continual
fever
burned
in
oscar
s
blood
until
the
task
was
done
thora
saw
nothing
of
him
for
days
except
when
he
bounded
in
to
run
over
a
part
of
his
score
with
helga
and
then
away
without
a
word
to
his
work
again
when
the
anthem
was
written
and
he
was
ready
to
try
it
on
the
organ
he
said
are
coming
across
to
the
cathedral
thora
no
perhaps
you
had
better
not
we
ll
have
to
go
over
the
thing
again
and
again
it
might
be
tiresome
it
was
the
afternoon
of
a
dull
in
the
early
winter
and
some
of
the
dreary
noises
of
the
world
followed
oscar
into
the
cathedral
a
vessel
was
unloading
in
the
fiord
he
could
hear
the
rumble
of
the
iron
trolleys
as
they
rolled
up
the
paved
jetty
to
the
factor
s
warehouse
a
new
house
was
being
erected
on
the
corner
of
the
cathedral
square
he
could
hear
the
thin
clank
of
the
mason
s
trowel
a
steamer
was
on
the
stocks
in
the
shipyard
down
the
harbor
he
could
hear
the
sharp
beat
of
the
riveter
s
hammer
but
there
was
another
atmosphere
in
the
cathedral
and
oscar
floated
on
it
as
on
a
flood
the
silent
sanctuary
the
rows
of
empty
pews
going
up
to
the
chancel
the
empty
pulpit
with
its
the
empty
altar
with
the
eastern
subject
painted
above
it
the
marble
font
for
the
baptism
of
future
generations
the
marble
monuments
to
the
memory
of
past
ones
and
then
the
listening
air
awakened
by
a
whisper
or
a
footfall
and
full
of
the
breath
of
dead
prayer
and
vanished
praise
in
this
atmosphere
of
art
and
religion
oscar
sat
down
at
the
organ
with
helga
by
his
side
to
try
his
anthem
for
the
first
time
the
organ
throbbed
under
his
fingers
the
empty
cathedral
shook
like
a
under
the
boom
of
his
waves
of
sound
and
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
his
first
reading
he
was
quivering
with
excitement
and
helga
was
in
a
fever
what
did
i
tell
you
she
said
was
i
not
right
oh
if
this
could
be
heard
in
denmark
or
in
england
said
oscar
they
played
the
piece
again
and
again
and
at
every
fresh
playing
their
excitement
increased
until
it
reached
the
point
of
hysteria
and
their
voices
in
that
silent
place
became
as
shrill
as
the
wind
on
the
mountain
top
at
last
they
tried
the
words
and
then
their
emotion
knew
no
limit
the
organ
trembled
and
throbbed
again
and
then
on
the
top
of
all
other
sounds
came
the
sound
of
helga
s
voice
like
a
human
cry
above
the
thundering
waves
of
nature
sometimes
weeping
sometimes
raging
sometimes
crouching
sometimes
springing
out
of
the
surge
and
finally
sinking
down
to
the
soft
whisper
of
let
there
be
peace
when
the
anthem
was
over
and
all
was
still
oscar
sat
quiet
for
some
moments
while
the
unheard
echo
of
the
music
seemed
to
roll
through
the
silent
air
and
then
the
of
joy
or
madness
which
comes
to
every
man
of
genius
once
in
his
life
came
to
him
also
and
his
heart
cried
out
in
its
delirious
happiness
i
too
am
a
great
composer
in
the
intoxication
of
that
moment
oscar
s
hand
swung
down
and
took
helga
s
hand
and
held
it
and
their
fingers
trembled
together
and
they
seemed
to
hear
the
beating
of
each
other
s
heart
they
looked
at
each
other
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
hers
were
wet
helga
he
cried
oscar
she
answered
but
at
the
next
moment
a
window
blew
open
on
the
staircase
to
the
organ
loft
and
oscar
heard
again
the
dreary
noises
of
the
world
without
the
rumble
of
the
iron
trolleys
the
thin
clank
of
the
mason
s
trowel
and
the
quick
beat
of
the
riveter
s
hammer
it
was
like
the
wakening
of
a
prisoner
in
his
cell
when
the
warder
beats
at
the
door
and
the
dream
of
glory
is
gone
and
the
prison
walls
close
round
him
again
oscar
s
fingers
slackened
and
the
next
moment
he
heard
helga
s
rapid
breathing
behind
him
and
her
voice
saying
with
a
strange
bitterness
is
that
thora
he
started
and
turned
where
he
asked
down
there
by
the
communion
steps
by
the
altar
no
i
was
mistaken
it
s
only
a
shadow
the
light
is
fading
then
with
the
same
bitterness
she
said
but
i
suppose
she
will
be
there
soon
and
you
with
her
oscar
shuddered
as
if
a
wounded
artery
had
been
torn
open
and
helga
continued
then
you
will
go
back
to
business
and
oscar
oscar
stephenson
the
musician
will
be
dead
he
fingered
the
organ
stops
fumblingly
and
made
no
reply
whereupon
helga
with
undisguised
irony
began
to
picture
the
dull
routine
of
the
business
life
that
was
waiting
for
him
after
marriage
its
calculations
of
discounts
its
squabbles
with
farmers
its
buying
and
selling
of
pots
and
pans
it
is
such
a
pity
she
said
don
t
torture
me
helga
he
cried
but
is
there
no
way
out
of
it
no
no
no
no
way
at
all
oscar
let
us
go
he
said
and
he
had
got
down
to
the
door
before
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
his
hat
behind
him
in
the
organ
loft
thora
had
tea
ready
when
they
got
back
to
the
factor
s
she
was
kneeling
before
a
cozy
fire
making
toast
after
cutting
the
bread
and
butter
and
she
looked
up
at
them
as
they
entered
with
a
nervous
questioning
tearful
smile
poor
little
soul
she
must
never
know
never
never
thought
oscar
thora
knew
already
and
the
big
heart
in
her
little
breast
was
breaking
she
had
begun
to
think
that
what
had
happened
to
magnus
when
oscar
came
back
was
now
happening
to
her
oscar
was
falling
in
love
with
helga
and
she
like
magnus
was
being
left
alone
yet
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
this
suspicion
without
a
hard
battle
and
the
first
skirmish
of
the
sweet
heart
was
to
fight
for
the
enemy
oscar
had
made
a
great
great
sacrifice
when
he
agreed
to
marry
her
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
he
had
spasms
of
regret
sometimes
she
hinted
as
much
to
aunt
margret
in
one
of
the
long
hours
in
which
they
were
left
together
don
t
you
think
that
oscar
was
very
unselfish
when
he
signed
that
contract
she
said
unselfish
i
don
t
call
it
unselfishness
to
sign
yourself
into
a
fortune
said
aunt
margret
but
he
had
to
take
up
the
business
you
know
certainly
he
had
the
best
business
in
iceland
helga
seems
to
think
it
is
a
little
beneath
him
aunt
margret
it
s
good
enough
for
helga
s
father
and
he
made
it
besides
oscar
had
nothing
else
and
an
ugly
sheep
is
better
than
no
mutton
oh
yes
he
had
his
music
auntie
and
helga
thinks
that
was
a
good
deal
does
she
indeed
people
who
are
naked
needn
t
go
about
mending
other
people
s
clothes
oscar
s
music
wouldn
t
have
brought
him
a
penny
of
profit
and
as
for
honor
what
about
althing
and
all
the
other
things
he
couldn
t
have
got
without
being
rich
so
you
don
t
think
oscar
sacrificed
himself
very
much
when
he
signed
the
contract
sacrificed
himself
perhaps
the
boot
was
on
the
other
leg
if
you
ask
me
thora
was
happy
for
days
after
this
interview
and
while
oscar
and
helga
played
their
wagner
she
went
about
the
house
singing
her
little
love
ditties
and
thinking
of
the
time
when
parliament
would
begin
its
session
and
oscar
would
throw
himself
into
politics
and
become
speaker
and
perhaps
governor
and
it
would
all
come
of
having
married
her
but
it
was
hard
to
sit
for
hours
in
the
same
room
with
people
who
were
scarcely
conscious
of
her
presence
and
though
thora
tried
to
hide
her
pain
lest
oscar
should
feel
ashamed
she
sometimes
felt
bitter
about
helga
and
wanted
to
burst
out
on
her
the
only
thing
which
restrained
her
from
doing
so
was
a
sweet
doubt
which
she
cherished
in
the
most
secret
chamber
of
her
heart
that
perhaps
she
was
mistaken
after
all
and
oscar
did
not
really
care
for
helga
auntie
she
said
don
t
you
think
it
s
silly
to
be
jealous
depends
upon
circumstances
thora
if
a
wife
for
example
fancies
her
husband
is
paying
too
much
attention
to
another
woman
don
t
you
think
she
is
silly
to
be
jealous
she
s
silly
to
show
she
is
my
precious
it
doesn
t
prevent
the
sting
to
bite
the
head
off
the
serpent
and
if
a
wife
shows
the
husband
she
s
jealous
she
s
just
doing
what
the
other
woman
wants
so
you
think
she
ought
to
be
quiet
and
say
nothing
certainly
i
do
if
the
man
is
going
to
run
away
from
her
she
had
better
let
him
run
and
if
he
isn
t
he
ll
be
the
more
ashamed
because
he
thinks
she
doesn
t
know
you
mean
that
if
the
man
is
only
fascinated
for
a
time
just
so
fascination
may
be
good
enough
for
a
flirtation
but
it
s
like
bright
metal
it
soon
gets
tarnished
in
a
damp
cellar
you
want
gold
for
the
dark
places
my
honey
that
is
to
say
auntie
dear
that
love
is
the
only
thing
for
married
life
i
should
think
so
indeed
with
its
crosses
and
disappointments
and
children
and
croup
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
when
it
comes
to
marrying
the
silliest
of
the
men
know
that
bless
them
what
a
lot
you
know
about
the
men
auntie
darling
i
wonder
you
never
married
yourself
dear
that
s
why
my
precious
it
was
easier
for
thora
to
veil
her
agonies
with
smiles
after
this
conversation
she
pictured
to
herself
the
time
when
her
love
would
be
everything
to
oscar
in
the
secret
places
of
her
soul
she
thought
of
the
days
when
children
would
come
and
perhaps
even
sickness
and
they
would
be
drawn
close
so
close
together
because
the
dear
clouds
of
life
hung
over
both
of
them
she
was
not
beautiful
she
was
only
a
homely
and
humble
little
thing
she
was
unworthy
of
oscar
and
there
were
so
many
things
in
which
she
was
inferior
but
oh
her
love
was
wonderful
nothing
in
the
world
was
so
wonderful
as
her
love
it
would
work
miracles
it
would
be
stronger
than
death
it
would
stand
by
oscar
to
the
end
but
all
the
same
it
was
hard
to
receive
her
wounds
without
a
cry
and
when
oscar
and
helga
went
off
to
the
cathedral
and
left
her
at
home
she
told
herself
she
was
too
ignorant
to
be
oscar
s
wife
and
all
her
sweet
heroic
love
was
wasted
don
t
you
think
helga
is
very
clever
aunt
margret
aunt
margret
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
knitting
and
blinked
through
her
spectacles
clever
a
girl
who
can
t
darn
a
stocking
or
boil
a
potato
but
see
how
she
can
talk
auntie
so
can
the
parrot
my
dear
and
the
raven
is
seldom
sparing
of
his
voice
either
but
surely
a
man
wants
his
wife
to
be
a
companion
auntie
to
be
able
to
converse
with
him
on
the
subjects
he
is
interested
in
and
to
criticise
his
work
perhaps
does
he
perhaps
he
does
but
it
would
be
a
crazy
creature
of
a
man
who
would
rather
marry
a
critic
than
a
cook
for
all
that
always
after
this
thora
had
tea
ready
when
oscar
and
helga
returned
from
the
cathedral
and
if
her
heart
had
its
tremors
still
she
tried
to
take
care
that
oscar
should
never
see
a
tear
in
her
eyes
but
many
a
time
when
she
felt
herself
to
be
like
an
isthmus
between
the
two
holding
them
together
yet
keeping
them
apart
the
strung
bow
of
her
will
slackened
and
she
was
nearly
breaking
down
she
waited
day
by
day
for
oscar
s
heart
to
speak
to
her
and
when
it
did
not
speak
she
told
herself
it
was
because
helga
was
so
beautiful
isn
t
helga
beautiful
aunt
margret
perhaps
said
aunt
margret
you
she
is
auntie
you
know
she
is
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
iceland
maybe
i
do
maybe
i
don
t
what
an
advantage
beauty
like
helga
s
gives
to
a
girl
she
gets
everything
and
everybody
if
a
girl
is
only
beautiful
enough
she
has
all
the
men
at
her
feet
they
must
he
chiropodists
then
and
there
are
not
many
of
them
in
these
parts
no
no
beauty
isn
t
everything
thora
and
that
s
a
mercy
for
some
of
us
the
color
began
to
mount
to
thora
s
eyes
and
catching
sight
of
this
flag
of
distress
aunt
margret
continued
but
fine
feathers
make
fine
birds
and
i
know
some
in
iceland
dress
would
make
helga
look
small
if
they
were
done
up
in
her
danish
folderols
thora
s
blushing
face
began
to
shine
like
the
sunrise
but
what
s
the
use
beauty
fills
the
eye
but
not
the
belly
auntie
margret
what
plain
things
you
say
do
i
then
it
s
best
to
say
them
plainly
it
isn
t
good
to
gild
copper
with
gold
my
honey
after
this
talk
with
aunt
margret
thora
was
more
the
mistress
of
herself
than
before
because
the
dividing
line
between
helga
and
herself
seemed
less
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
dress
in
the
english
manner
so
that
oscar
should
not
see
so
much
difference
she
had
money
the
dress
money
her
father
gave
her
it
was
not
very
much
but
in
previous
years
she
had
given
away
most
of
it
and
this
year
she
had
intended
to
buy
a
scotch
overcoat
for
hans
the
sailor
who
was
losing
all
respect
for
himself
and
going
about
in
cold
weather
with
nothing
over
his
shirt
but
now
she
would
be
selfish
she
would
spend
her
money
on
herself
and
that
was
only
right
since
it
was
spending
it
on
oscar
also
it
must
be
a
secret
a
great
secret
it
must
come
upon
everybody
as
a
surprise
because
that
would
be
half
the
battle
so
she
bought
postal
orders
with
her
savings
and
sent
to
edinburgh
for
a
costume
such
as
she
saw
in
the
picture
of
a
trade
advertisement
the
costume
came
by
a
trading
steamer
and
she
was
like
a
child
in
her
secrecy
and
joy
smuggling
the
big
cardboard
box
to
her
room
and
answering
the
inquisitive
questions
of
the
factor
and
aunt
margret
with
mysterious
little
nods
and
subterfuges
the
day
was
crisp
and
frosty
and
when
oscar
coming
in
the
afternoon
suggested
a
walk
to
the
lake
to
try
the
ice
for
skating
helga
responded
readily
but
thora
said
no
she
had
something
to
do
something
important
a
little
surprise
they
should
see
when
they
came
back
again
as
soon
as
helga
and
oscar
had
gone
and
aunt
margret
had
promised
to
make
tea
thora
stole
up
to
her
room
locked
the
door
opened
the
box
and
took
out
the
new
garments
that
were
to
work
the
wondrous
change
they
were
beautiful
they
were
dreams
they
were
lovelier
than
anything
of
helga
s
a
blue
voile
dress
with
a
silk
corsage
and
embroidered
yoke
the
pleated
skirt
was
like
the
sun
s
rays
over
hecla
after
a
shower
of
summer
rain
and
the
silk
of
the
blouse
was
as
beautiful
as
the
ice
of
a
glacier
with
the
flowery
bubbles
of
air
in
it
thora
laughed
for
joy
and
taking
off
her
old
iceland
costume
she
threw
it
aside
as
a
thing
she
had
done
with
the
granny
skirt
the
stiff
treya
and
the
starchy
brjest
she
wondered
how
she
could
have
worn
them
so
long
and
even
told
herself
what
she
would
do
with
them
she
would
give
them
to
a
young
widow
who
had
lately
lost
her
child
by
diphtheria
and
joined
the
people
at
the
salvation
shelter
when
she
took
up
the
new
garments
she
had
some
doubt
as
to
how
they
were
to
be
put
on
and
almost
wished
she
had
inquired
of
helga
the
accordion
skirt
was
easy
enough
and
its
ample
train
made
her
feel
tall
and
imposing
but
the
blouse
was
a
besetting
trouble
it
fastened
behind
and
after
despairing
efforts
to
catch
the
hooks
and
eyes
she
was
tempted
to
call
aunt
margret
but
she
thought
no
that
would
never
do
so
she
struggled
on
the
room
was
cold
but
when
she
had
finished
dressing
her
face
was
flushed
and
heated
she
had
put
on
her
silver
belt
because
it
was
a
present
from
oscar
and
brushed
her
hair
sideways
over
the
forehead
because
that
was
how
helga
wore
it
then
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
laughed
again
for
she
was
proud
and
happy
what
would
oscar
say
when
he
saw
her
he
would
say
why
this
is
helga
another
helga
not
quite
so
tall
perhaps
but
just
yes
really
just
as
and
then
helga
would
be
angry
and
envious
and
perhaps
go
back
to
denmark
she
was
walking
to
and
fro
on
tiptoe
glancing
with
sparkling
eyes
at
her
figure
in
the
glass
when
she
heard
voices
in
the
hall
below
thora
cried
somebody
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
it
was
oscar
i
m
coming
she
answered
what
about
the
great
surprise
presently
she
cried
she
waited
until
she
heard
a
door
close
below
and
then
still
laughing
a
little
but
breathing
rapidly
feeling
sure
of
victory
yet
with
a
fluttering
at
her
heart
she
went
down
the
stairs
and
sailed
into
the
oscar
was
leaning
on
the
marble
stove
and
helga
sitting
on
a
low
seat
was
warming
her
feet
at
the
fire
they
turned
to
thora
as
she
entered
and
looked
at
her
with
wide
eyes
there
was
a
moment
of
chilling
silence
and
then
thora
breathing
faster
and
faster
said
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
helga
began
to
laugh
first
in
a
smothered
titter
hut
finally
in
an
outright
roar
whereupon
oscar
who
had
struggled
not
to
smile
caught
the
contagion
and
joined
her
thora
s
pitiful
face
fell
and
she
said
with
a
crack
in
her
voice
but
what
are
you
laughing
at
oscar
my
dear
dear
child
said
oscar
and
helga
who
was
still
laughing
said
a
little
milliner
it
makes
her
look
like
a
little
milliner
no
no
not
that
said
oscar
but
it
s
not
thora
thora
is
a
sweet
simple
iceland
maiden
whose
charm
is
her
simplicity
whereas
this
i
see
said
thora
and
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
she
turned
to
go
oscar
stepped
to
the
door
to
stop
her
but
with
the
shrill
cry
of
a
hare
that
is
wounded
to
death
she
flung
out
at
him
and
passed
through
she
went
with
a
slow
step
took
off
her
english
costume
put
it
back
in
the
cardboard
box
and
pushed
it
under
the
bed
crying
a
little
and
wiping
her
eyes
she
knew
the
truth
at
last
she
knew
where
she
stood
in
oscar
s
mind
a
simple
iceland
maiden
that
was
all
he
had
ever
seen
in
her
it
was
she
who
had
merely
fascinated
him
and
helga
whom
he
loved
when
the
door
of
the
closed
on
thora
oscar
looked
at
helga
and
said
whatever
has
come
over
her
don
t
you
see
said
helga
why
no
what
is
it
how
stupid
these
clever
boys
can
he
i
could
tell
you
in
three
words
tell
me
then
tell
me
thora
is
jealous
you
don
t
mean
that
helga
s
face
flushed
she
looked
up
at
oscar
and
a
mysterious
thrill
went
through
him
the
great
surprise
had
come
indeed
oscar
slept
badly
that
night
for
two
months
he
had
been
moving
in
a
garden
of
dreams
where
the
odor
of
sweet
flowers
overpower
the
senses
but
he
was
awake
at
last
and
was
being
dragged
to
trial
in
a
tribunal
of
his
own
creating
in
that
court
of
conscience
he
was
both
righteous
judge
and
guilty
prisoner
and
through
the
long
hours
of
broken
sleep
when
he
saw
his
life
and
motives
as
by
flashes
of
lightning
he
asked
and
answered
some
terrible
questions
is
thora
s
jealousy
justified
no
yes
that
is
to
say
i
may
have
neglected
her
thoughtlessly
neglected
her
do
you
love
helga
it
isn
t
necessary
to
think
that
i
admire
her
i
admire
her
beauty
and
her
intellect
but
then
you
do
not
love
her
i
love
her
society
i
love
to
be
with
her
she
is
bright
and
brilliant
we
have
many
interests
in
common
then
if
you
do
not
love
helga
why
not
cut
her
off
rather
than
see
thora
suffer
i
can
t
i
can
t
so
you
love
helga
yes
yes
i
do
love
her
then
what
about
thora
i
am
sorry
for
thora
very
sorry
have
you
ceased
to
love
her
don
t
say
that
my
feeling
for
thora
is
the
same
now
as
it
has
always
been
then
you
have
loved
her
i
thought
i
did
i
sincerely
thought
i
did
so
your
feeling
for
thora
was
an
illusion
a
most
unfortunate
illusion
and
i
am
troubled
about
her
i
shall
always
be
troubled
about
her
but
you
are
betrothed
to
her
god
help
me
so
i
am
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
what
am
i
going
to
do
i
am
yes
i
am
going
to
obey
the
commandment
of
nature
accident
and
error
and
illusion
have
betrothed
me
to
the
wrong
woman
but
must
i
hold
to
her
after
i
have
found
out
that
i
do
not
love
her
no
she
is
sweet
and
loving
and
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
her
but
i
must
obey
the
law
of
my
heart
and
who
shall
judge
me
if
i
do
that
but
what
about
the
law
of
the
land
you
have
signed
a
contract
to
marry
thora
even
so
is
marriage
like
any
other
worldly
transaction
are
you
bound
to
go
on
merely
because
you
have
begun
can
human
hearts
be
dealt
with
like
so
much
merchandise
so
you
do
intend
to
marry
thora
i
can
not
it
is
impossible
now
that
her
sister
has
appeared
before
me
i
see
too
well
i
do
not
love
her
but
loves
that
is
the
pity
of
it
poor
thora
she
thinks
you
are
slipping
away
from
her
it
is
very
pitiful
i
see
how
i
have
made
her
suffer
what
will
happen
if
you
leave
her
altogether
her
heart
will
break
her
tender
sweet
child
heart
will
break
can
you
break
thora
s
heart
no
no
no
better
break
my
own
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
must
go
on
with
the
marriage
i
see
now
that
i
must
it
is
my
duty
there
is
no
help
for
it
wait
there
is
something
you
have
not
thought
about
if
you
go
on
with
your
contract
and
marry
thora
you
must
be
prepared
to
live
her
life
i
know
i
know
and
i
am
not
fit
for
it
good
or
bad
i
am
not
fit
for
it
but
if
you
break
your
contract
and
do
not
marry
thora
you
may
live
the
life
of
helga
yes
yes
and
i
am
fitted
for
that
life
above
everything
else
it
thrills
me
it
inspires
me
it
lifts
me
up
the
one
is
the
lower
life
while
the
other
is
the
higher
life
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
it
you
know
that
if
you
marry
thora
you
condemn
yourself
for
ever
to
the
lower
life
and
give
up
all
hope
and
all
thought
of
the
higher
one
don
t
torture
me
don
t
torture
me
but
the
higher
life
will
be
a
life
consecrated
to
self
whereas
the
lower
life
will
be
a
life
devoted
to
which
is
it
to
be
that
settles
it
i
must
go
on
with
the
contract
whatever
the
consequences
when
oscar
awoke
in
the
morning
from
his
restless
sleep
he
thought
he
saw
his
way
clearly
there
was
only
one
solution
of
the
hard
problem
of
his
iron
destiny
he
must
sacrifice
himself
he
was
betrothed
to
thora
and
he
must
go
on
with
the
marriage
he
loved
helga
but
he
must
tear
her
out
of
his
heart
he
wished
to
be
a
musician
and
to
live
the
higher
life
but
he
must
be
content
with
the
lower
life
and
do
his
duty
a
few
irresistible
pangs
of
regret
a
few
tears
which
he
could
not
quite
keep
back
and
then
feeling
a
certain
satisfaction
with
himself
a
certain
pride
in
his
oscar
went
early
to
his
work
it
was
the
autumn
caravan
time
when
the
farmers
come
with
the
last
of
the
year
s
tallow
and
wool
to
have
their
accounts
made
up
and
settled
the
offices
and
warehouses
were
like
a
and
there
was
work
for
everybody
oscar
threw
himself
into
the
day
s
doings
with
astonishing
energy
and
when
the
factor
returned
from
breakfast
he
bantered
him
on
his
industry
better
late
than
never
though
said
the
factor
and
a
good
day
in
the
autumn
is
worth
two
in
the
spring
oscar
spent
the
morning
in
the
office
helping
at
the
accounts
his
part
was
to
reconcile
the
farmers
to
their
balances
for
many
of
them
were
dissatisfied
and
nearly
all
were
in
the
factor
s
debt
some
grumbled
at
the
rate
they
received
for
their
produce
others
at
the
price
they
paid
for
foreign
goods
oscar
s
task
was
to
persuade
cajole
and
comfort
them
and
finally
to
draft
the
notes
of
hand
on
the
bankers
with
which
they
discharged
their
debts
he
felt
mean
and
miserable
toward
noon
helga
sent
a
messenger
to
say
that
she
hoped
to
rehearse
some
of
the
new
music
in
the
cathedral
in
the
afternoon
and
to
ask
if
oscar
would
go
with
her
he
answered
that
he
could
not
business
was
pressing
and
he
must
stick
to
his
work
it
cost
him
a
pang
to
send
back
this
answer
but
he
had
made
his
bed
and
he
meant
to
lie
on
it
he
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
warehouse
where
the
produce
brought
by
the
farmers
was
weighed
and
stacked
away
for
the
winter
the
odor
of
the
tallow
and
wool
mingling
with
the
smell
of
the
men
s
clothes
and
the
reek
of
their
bodies
made
the
atmosphere
close
and
noisome
and
to
freshen
the
air
oscar
ordered
the
big
doors
to
be
thrown
open
all
at
once
through
the
clear
crisp
winter
air
outside
came
the
sound
of
the
organ
being
played
in
the
cathedral
and
that
was
the
last
drop
in
his
cup
it
was
like
a
voice
calling
him
out
of
the
lower
world
he
lived
in
to
the
higher
one
he
yearned
for
it
was
like
helga
beckoning
to
him
in
his
unblessed
surroundings
and
through
the
roll
of
the
music
he
could
see
her
face
for
the
first
time
oscar
was
feeling
bitterly
about
thora
as
if
he
were
a
prisoner
and
she
were
his
jailer
when
a
man
rode
up
to
the
warehouse
door
on
a
bright
chestnut
pony
with
a
line
of
pack
ponies
behind
him
it
was
magnus
and
seeing
him
stand
outside
the
counter
which
he
had
formerly
stood
within
oscar
felt
some
qualms
of
shame
and
called
him
into
the
scalesman
s
office
the
interview
between
the
brothers
was
brief
and
commonplace
but
every
simple
word
seemed
to
throb
and
scorch
like
a
flame
oscar
asked
how
magnus
was
getting
on
at
the
farm
and
if
he
had
good
servants
and
magnus
answered
yes
he
had
always
been
fond
of
farming
and
for
servants
he
had
only
the
old
ones
and
everything
was
as
before
oscar
asked
if
the
governor
had
made
satisfactory
arrangements
and
magnus
said
he
had
that
the
farm
was
his
own
now
on
terms
of
tenancy
and
was
to
become
his
property
at
the
old
people
s
death
and
how
are
you
getting
on
here
asked
magnus
i
oh
pretty
well
i
think
you
like
the
work
yes
well
not
to
say
like
perhaps
i
never
expected
to
do
that
you
know
but
i
m
all
right
i
think
they
had
to
pause
for
the
din
in
the
warehouse
was
louder
than
usual
some
of
the
farmers
were
squabbling
with
the
scalesmen
and
thora
said
magnus
after
a
moment
thora
oh
thora
is
all
right
too
i
think
yes
thora
is
all
right
said
oscar
mother
tells
me
she
looks
pale
pale
does
she
i
hadn
t
noticed
it
perhaps
she
does
though
the
weather
is
getting
cold
there
was
a
painful
pause
in
their
conversation
and
while
they
waited
oscar
could
hear
the
organ
in
the
cathedral
breaking
into
the
opening
notes
of
his
own
anthem
i
hear
that
helga
has
come
home
said
magnus
oh
yes
helga
has
come
home
said
oscar
they
say
she
is
handsome
handsome
yes
she
s
rather
handsome
in
fact
distinctly
handsome
and
musical
decidedly
musical
indeed
she
has
grown
to
be
a
very
attractive
girl
very
there
was
another
awkward
silence
in
which
the
anthem
pealed
out
over
the
jangling
voices
in
the
warehouse
i
suppose
the
wedding
will
be
soon
said
magnus
the
wedding
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
magnus
nothing
has
been
fixed
yet
not
yet
nothing
definite
i
mean
no
precise
date
i
don
t
know
why
but
oscar
looked
at
his
brother
and
felt
his
tongue
arrested
magnus
was
calm
his
eyes
were
quiet
and
his
voice
was
soft
but
there
was
something
in
his
face
which
brought
back
a
terrible
memory
it
was
the
memory
of
the
night
of
the
betrothal
the
last
time
they
talked
together
when
magnus
had
said
if
you
ever
neglect
or
desert
her
or
give
her
up
for
another
woman
i
ll
take
her
back
do
you
hear
me
i
ll
take
her
back
and
then
by
god
i
ll
kill
you
oscar
supped
at
the
factor
s
house
that
night
he
was
unusually
solemn
and
more
than
once
during
the
meal
aunt
margret
bantered
him
on
his
silence
but
at
the
end
of
it
while
lighting
a
cigarette
he
said
godfather
i
hope
you
ll
consent
to
our
having
the
wedding
soon
thora
who
had
been
looking
pale
and
nervous
colored
up
with
a
glad
look
while
helga
who
had
been
flushed
and
excited
grew
white
and
rigid
what
do
you
call
soon
oscar
easter
asked
the
factor
earlier
much
earlier
say
the
middle
of
january
at
latest
said
oscar
but
what
does
thora
say
rising
from
her
seat
with
brightening
eyes
and
heaving
bosom
thora
crossed
over
to
oscar
and
kissed
him
so
that
s
what
thora
says
laughed
the
factor
very
well
i
m
willing
the
middle
of
january
let
it
be
then
and
fix
the
date
between
you
helga
s
white
face
quivered
so
settled
she
cried
and
leaping
up
she
went
across
to
the
piano
and
began
to
play
with
great
vigor
she
played
the
wild
ride
of
the
valkyries
becoming
faster
and
louder
at
every
bar
oscar
was
in
torture
and
he
went
home
early
what
a
mercy
helga
does
not
know
he
thought
if
she
did
i
could
not
trust
myself
even
yet
and
if
she
loves
me
as
i
love
her
good
god
but
thora
was
very
happy
going
to
bed
that
night
she
thought
how
wrong
i
have
been
about
oscar
how
cruelly
wickedly
shamefully
wrong
next
morning
oscar
thought
the
battle
was
over
and
his
conscience
had
conquered
but
the
devil
was
not
done
with
him
yet
he
had
hardly
settled
to
his
work
in
the
warehouse
when
a
letter
came
from
helga
saying
the
ice
is
perfect
on
the
lake
this
morning
ant
in
spite
of
business
and
every
other
botheration
you
must
carry
out
your
promise
to
take
me
to
skate
therefore
come
at
two
o
clock
to
the
minute
and
you
will
find
me
waiting
to
go
with
you
it
was
the
first
letter
he
had
received
from
helga
and
it
seemed
to
burn
his
fingers
the
scented
and
the
free
bold
handwriting
gave
him
a
physical
thrill
which
he
had
never
felt
before
should
he
go
his
soul
said
certainly
not
why
expose
yourself
to
temptation
especially
now
when
you
are
as
weak
as
water
but
his
heart
said
you
must
to
make
any
difference
in
your
attitude
toward
helga
would
be
to
run
the
risk
of
betraying
your
secret
and
what
about
the
future
can
you
always
run
away
like
that
his
heart
won
and
at
the
appointed
time
he
was
walking
up
to
the
factor
s
helga
was
standing
by
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
she
was
dressed
in
pale
blue
serge
a
short
skirt
exposing
the
long
tanned
boots
a
jersey
revealing
the
flexible
lines
of
her
shapely
figure
and
a
white
woolen
cap
like
a
chain
helmet
covering
half
her
forehead
and
closing
under
her
chin
leaving
her
vivid
face
bare
and
beautiful
as
a
young
nun
s
in
hood
and
bands
oscar
was
beginning
to
doubt
himself
already
and
he
asked
where
was
thora
i
m
here
said
a
cheerful
voice
from
the
hall
and
thora
came
to
the
door
bright
and
happy
but
bareheaded
and
sewing
a
piece
of
moleskin
cloth
not
ready
said
oscar
i
m
not
going
i
can
t
skate
said
thora
then
we
ll
take
a
walk
instead
said
oscar
but
thora
would
not
hear
of
it
helga
had
set
her
heart
on
skating
and
she
had
set
her
heart
on
something
else
making
a
sleeve
waistcoat
for
hans
the
sailor
well
if
you
really
wish
it
said
oscar
really
truly
and
i
ll
have
tea
ready
for
you
at
five
o
clock
we
ll
be
back
before
that
said
oscar
and
then
he
and
helga
went
swinging
down
the
road
helga
in
her
short
skirt
walked
with
a
spring
like
a
young
horse
in
sharp
weather
and
oscar
as
he
swung
along
by
her
aide
sometimes
touching
her
felt
his
blood
tingling
and
every
nerve
tremblingly
alive
this
frightened
him
a
little
and
turning
to
look
back
he
saw
thora
waving
to
them
from
the
house
and
said
god
bless
her
the
dear
little
soul
and
then
helga
glanced
at
him
sideways
and
laughed
the
frost
had
filtered
the
air
and
it
was
crisp
and
quivering
with
currents
of
electricity
which
stimulated
all
their
senses
their
voices
crackled
when
they
spoke
and
when
helga
laughed
the
sound
was
like
that
of
dry
sticks
in
a
quick
fire
what
are
you
laughing
at
helga
i
don
t
know
she
said
and
then
they
laughed
together
the
ice
of
the
lake
was
glorious
a
broad
mirror
black
as
ink
for
there
had
been
no
snow
yet
the
water
had
frozen
as
by
first
intention
and
through
five
fathoms
they
could
see
the
stones
and
pebbles
at
the
bottom
what
a
pity
thora
didn
t
come
said
oscar
isn
t
it
said
helga
and
again
she
glanced
at
him
sideways
and
laughed
they
sat
on
the
bank
to
put
on
their
skates
and
while
helga
fumbled
at
her
straps
oscar
thought
i
must
not
i
will
not
but
helga
looked
across
at
him
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
ask
a
question
and
at
the
next
moment
he
was
down
on
his
knees
in
front
of
her
with
one
of
her
skates
and
one
of
her
long
tanned
boots
in
his
quivering
hands
oscar
thought
helga
s
skating
was
wonderful
it
was
divine
it
was
devilish
it
intoxicated
him
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
look
at
it
alone
and
seeing
a
number
of
skaters
at
the
farther
side
of
the
lake
where
there
was
an
island
of
lava
rocks
he
said
let
us
go
over
to
the
others
hours
passed
the
exercise
and
the
air
warmed
his
blood
his
tremors
left
him
and
he
forgot
about
thora
at
length
the
sun
began
to
set
over
the
sea
in
a
flood
of
glory
and
oscar
said
time
to
go
home
not
yet
said
helga
and
they
went
round
and
round
the
island
sometimes
apart
sometimes
with
clasped
hands
sometimes
side
by
side
with
arms
interlaced
across
their
breasts
the
sun
went
down
and
both
sea
and
land
became
gray
and
cold
but
still
the
tops
of
the
mountains
were
golden
tea
will
be
waiting
said
oscar
a
little
longer
said
helga
and
nothing
loath
oscar
went
round
and
round
with
her
again
the
night
came
striding
up
from
the
plain
behind
and
somebody
lit
a
fire
on
the
island
too
late
for
tea
now
said
helga
and
once
again
oscar
went
round
and
round
with
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
helga
s
face
flashed
with
electric
flame
as
she
swirled
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
red
glow
from
the
fire
and
back
again
into
the
darkness
one
of
the
skaters
started
the
others
joined
him
and
then
it
was
a
scene
of
complete
enchantment
the
frost
had
laid
its
hand
on
the
falls
that
fed
the
lake
and
they
were
quiet
it
had
stroked
the
streams
and
they
were
still
but
if
the
voices
of
the
waters
were
silent
the
voices
of
the
skaters
rippled
and
rang
in
the
crisp
night
air
dance
by
night
and
dance
by
day
life
and
time
will
pass
away
love
alone
will
last
alway
oscar
was
enraptured
the
humming
of
the
skates
the
swaying
of
the
ice
the
music
of
the
singers
the
heat
the
glow
the
sinuous
movement
and
above
all
the
girl
by
his
side
so
bright
so
beautiful
so
full
of
life
and
laughter
carried
away
every
sense
and
flesh
and
blood
were
afire
then
the
moon
rose
a
brilliant
moon
and
it
was
reflected
full
and
round
and
white
in
the
black
mirror
of
the
ice
with
its
streamers
going
off
from
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
comet
that
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
lay
there
at
their
feet
look
let
us
cut
across
it
cried
helga
and
away
they
shot
in
the
darkness
with
the
moon
s
reflection
receding
as
they
followed
it
until
they
came
to
the
limit
of
the
lake
and
then
the
skaters
and
the
fire
and
the
singing
were
far
behind
them
what
a
will
o
the
wisp
she
is
i
could
catch
you
quicker
than
i
could
catch
her
said
oscar
you
couldn
t
i
could
do
it
then
cried
helga
and
off
she
went
laughing
at
first
but
afterward
silent
yet
breathing
fast
and
at
last
panting
audibly
while
she
twisted
and
turned
to
escape
from
him
until
he
came
down
on
her
at
length
with
outstretched
arms
and
a
cry
of
done
and
then
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
was
clasping
her
to
his
breast
and
she
was
clinging
to
him
lest
she
should
fall
and
he
was
beating
kiss
after
kiss
upon
her
lips
at
the
next
moment
consciousness
came
back
to
him
like
an
ice
wind
blowing
in
a
furnace
his
arms
slackened
away
from
helga
and
he
said
in
a
cold
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
helga
it
was
wrong
of
me
i
am
very
sorry
helga
laughed
a
nervous
broken
laugh
which
seemed
to
say
are
you
sure
you
are
thinking
of
me
i
am
betrothed
to
your
sister
and
in
less
than
two
months
i
am
to
be
married
to
her
i
had
no
right
to
give
way
to
my
feelings
like
that
said
oscar
the
nervous
broken
laugh
came
again
and
it
said
as
plainly
as
words
could
speak
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
oscar
oscar
trembled
like
a
withered
leaf
he
was
like
a
man
standing
on
the
hot
ground
of
the
geysers
where
the
crust
was
thin
and
cracking
under
his
feet
let
us
go
home
he
said
take
off
my
skates
then
said
helga
she
sat
on
the
bank
in
the
moonlight
and
while
he
knelt
at
her
feet
and
fumbled
with
the
straps
his
tongue
went
on
with
rambling
sentences
but
every
word
was
tearing
as
at
a
torn
tendon
when
a
man
has
engaged
himself
to
a
good
woman
he
ought
to
be
true
to
her
it
is
his
duty
and
whatever
the
consequences
to
himself
he
ought
to
do
it
if
he
has
to
suffer
he
must
suffer
helga
and
if
he
has
to
sacrifice
himself
a
faint
sound
stopped
him
helga
was
crying
her
crying
seemed
to
search
his
innermost
thoughts
and
to
say
but
have
you
any
right
to
sacrifice
helga
helga
he
cried
but
she
took
no
notice
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
her
crying
became
deep
and
long
and
inconsolable
he
wished
to
comfort
her
but
he
dare
not
do
so
he
remembered
thora
and
magnus
the
factor
and
his
father
and
his
thoughts
danced
about
his
naked
soul
like
demons
helga
helga
he
cried
again
but
still
helga
s
weeping
continued
if
it
had
gone
on
a
moment
longer
he
must
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
again
and
told
her
that
he
loved
her
that
his
love
for
her
was
above
all
laws
all
illusions
all
conventions
it
was
the
commandment
of
nature
and
he
was
compelled
to
obey
it
and
they
must
fly
from
iceland
and
never
return
whatever
the
waste
of
ruined
lives
they
had
to
leave
behind
them
but
helga
s
crying
stopped
suddenly
and
throwing
back
her
head
she
said
fiercely
very
well
if
you
are
satisfied
so
am
i
then
she
leapt
to
her
feet
wiped
her
eyes
vigorously
and
laughed
a
short
hard
bitter
laugh
and
after
that
oscar
recovered
control
of
himself
let
us
be
off
she
said
going
back
by
the
road
that
skirts
the
lake
side
by
side
but
neither
touching
the
other
and
both
silent
oscar
thought
good
heavens
what
an
escape
another
moment
and
what
might
not
have
happened
what
a
fool
i
was
to
expose
myself
to
this
temptation
marriage
is
my
only
safeguard
it
must
be
soon
thora
and
i
must
go
away
when
we
return
helga
may
be
back
in
denmark
and
then
a
scene
like
this
will
never
occur
again
when
they
reached
the
house
at
last
he
felt
like
an
adulterer
coming
home
after
his
first
offense
but
thora
looked
happy
and
unsuspicious
i
knew
you
couldn
t
tear
yourselves
away
from
your
skating
so
i
put
the
tea
away
and
now
supper
is
nearly
ready
she
said
after
supper
oscar
said
godfather
i
wish
you
would
permit
me
to
alter
the
arrangement
of
last
evening
you
want
to
go
back
to
easter
eh
said
the
factor
no
sir
to
come
on
to
christmas
said
oscar
and
then
he
gave
his
reasons
thora
was
looking
pale
everybody
thought
so
she
wanted
a
change
he
would
like
to
take
her
to
england
perhaps
to
france
and
even
to
italy
they
might
stay
away
during
the
months
of
spring
and
come
back
for
the
first
of
summer
when
althing
would
open
its
session
and
by
that
time
thora
would
be
well
and
he
himself
would
be
ready
to
set
to
work
in
earnest
but
christmas
my
gracious
cried
aunt
margret
hardly
time
for
the
banns
and
what
about
thora
s
but
thora
herself
was
in
raptures
and
aunt
margret
s
objections
were
borne
down
christmas
let
it
be
then
said
the
factor
whereupon
thora
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
helga
whose
eyes
had
passed
with
a
quick
glance
from
face
to
face
while
her
own
grew
paler
and
paler
leapt
up
saying
and
now
let
us
have
a
dance
to
celebrate
the
happy
event
no
no
no
said
oscar
yes
yes
said
helga
and
sitting
down
to
the
piano
she
played
a
dance
tune
with
a
rapid
and
passionate
touch
make
him
dance
thora
she
cried
with
an
awful
brightness
in
her
eyes
thora
took
hold
of
oscar
and
dragged
him
to
his
feet
saying
laughingly
why
not
oscar
tables
and
chairs
were
pulled
aside
the
factor
went
off
to
smoke
and
oscar
and
thora
danced
while
helga
played
laughing
loudly
and
calling
to
them
again
and
again
helga
helga
not
so
fast
you
ll
kill
us
cried
thora
but
helga
only
laughed
the
louder
and
played
the
faster
with
a
fierceness
that
seemed
to
consume
her
like
a
fire
oscar
went
home
that
night
with
an
aching
heart
but
thora
went
to
bed
happy
how
wrong
i
was
about
dear
helga
also
she
thought
and
then
drawing
a
deep
breath
she
fell
asleep
to
think
yourself
happy
is
to
be
happy
and
thora
thought
herself
the
happiest
little
woman
in
the
world
the
weeks
before
her
wedding
were
the
brightest
period
of
her
heart
s
existence
she
counted
the
days
backward
from
the
day
she
was
living
in
to
the
day
of
all
days
that
was
to
come
and
every
morning
the
moment
she
awoke
she
said
to
herself
only
nineteen
now
and
then
eighteen
seventeen
and
sixteen
until
it
became
three
two
and
one
our
thora
is
like
a
white
mouse
in
a
revolving
cage
she
can
t
make
the
world
go
round
quickly
enough
said
aunt
margret
hers
was
not
the
happiness
that
makes
the
heart
afraid
and
she
had
not
a
moment
s
misgiving
about
oscar
now
she
never
once
saw
him
alone
for
more
than
two
minutes
together
but
that
did
not
trouble
her
at
all
he
came
and
went
every
day
always
in
a
hurry
and
always
breathless
and
she
gave
him
the
benevolence
of
a
smile
and
occasionally
the
charity
of
a
kiss
when
it
could
be
done
decently
behind
the
door
but
usually
he
had
to
be
content
to
see
her
seated
among
her
dressmakers
and
and
that
suited
him
better
than
she
knew
there
was
nothing
to
tarnish
the
white
simplicity
of
her
happiness
and
when
oscar
could
come
with
maps
and
tour
lists
to
arrange
about
their
journey
she
would
say
why
don
t
you
talk
it
over
with
helga
she
knows
more
about
traveling
and
then
oscar
would
stammer
a
little
and
say
well
if
you
are
willing
to
be
guided
by
helga
s
judgment
and
helga
herself
will
certainly
i
am
so
be
off
to
my
bedroom
and
settle
everything
whereupon
oscar
would
cry
no
no
we
re
right
enough
here
and
then
helga
and
he
the
one
trembling
lest
a
word
should
betray
him
the
other
going
through
the
bitterness
of
looking
at
happiness
through
another
s
eyes
would
discuss
routes
and
railway
journeys
to
the
click
of
scissors
and
the
buzz
of
the
sewing
machine
we
ll
go
up
by
the
mont
cenis
eh
no
by
the
st
gothard
we
ll
come
back
by
san
remo
and
nice
and
monte
carlo
yes
of
course
monte
carlo
my
gracious
it
might
be
helga
who
was
going
on
her
honeymoon
aunt
margret
would
say
mightn
t
it
thora
would
answer
and
then
she
would
laugh
like
a
child
in
the
holy
land
of
her
innocent
heart
she
had
only
one
thought
about
her
sister
that
she
had
done
her
the
wrong
of
suspecting
her
helga
might
know
nothing
about
that
but
knew
and
she
could
never
be
quite
satisfied
until
she
had
made
amends
time
and
again
she
thought
of
a
way
to
do
this
and
at
length
an
artful
scheme
occurred
to
her
it
was
a
daring
design
and
asking
herself
when
she
could
bring
it
to
pass
she
concluded
that
it
must
be
on
her
because
she
would
be
the
queen
of
her
own
little
kingdom
then
and
nobody
could
deny
her
anything
meantime
it
was
to
be
her
secret
and
helga
was
to
hear
nothing
about
lit
and
even
oscar
himself
was
not
to
know
there
was
only
one
other
streak
of
alloy
in
thora
s
happiness
and
that
was
her
memory
of
magnus
the
brave
heart
did
not
break
and
magnus
s
despair
might
be
dumb
but
the
thought
of
his
suffering
was
the
tang
of
iron
in
the
sweet
wine
of
thora
s
life
to
complete
her
happiness
everybody
had
to
share
it
so
when
oscar
came
one
day
she
took
him
into
the
hall
and
said
oscar
who
is
to
be
best
man
and
oscar
stammered
well
really
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
hadn
t
that
is
to
say
why
not
magnus
said
thora
magnus
i
thought
of
that
but
and
then
came
the
old
difficulty
he
had
not
yet
set
magnus
right
on
the
subject
of
the
betrothal
and
until
that
could
be
done
the
old
people
would
object
to
him
but
why
shouldn
t
you
do
it
now
oscar
such
a
splendid
moment
to
heal
every
sore
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
yes
certainly
that
s
so
said
oscar
but
he
went
off
with
a
troubled
face
and
thora
heard
no
more
from
him
on
the
subject
until
the
day
before
the
wedding
when
he
said
oh
by
the
way
about
the
best
man
that
splendid
scheme
of
yours
was
impossible
thora
impossible
mother
tells
me
magnus
has
gone
to
the
northlands
went
away
about
a
week
ago
it
seems
in
the
winter
and
on
the
eve
of
the
wedding
she
thinks
he
ll
be
back
for
that
but
of
course
we
can
t
take
risks
so
neils
you
remember
neils
finsen
the
sheriff
s
son
neils
came
back
in
the
last
steamer
and
he
ll
be
best
man
so
that
s
settled
what
a
pity
said
thora
and
then
oscar
who
had
opened
the
door
cried
helloa
snowing
we
re
going
to
have
a
white
wedding
thora
and
with
a
nervous
laugh
he
buttoned
up
his
coat
collar
and
went
off
without
kissing
her
she
remembered
this
again
when
she
was
going
to
bed
and
sitting
on
the
great
chair
before
the
cheerful
stove
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
all
so
sweet
and
cozy
she
reflected
that
it
was
the
last
time
she
was
to
sleep
in
her
father
s
house
the
three
weeks
were
almost
gone
at
last
and
so
was
her
girlhood
and
now
that
both
were
nearly
over
they
seemed
to
have
vanished
like
a
dream
she
was
happy
still
but
it
would
have
taken
very
little
to
turn
her
happiness
into
pain
it
was
a
pity
oscar
had
forgotten
to
kiss
her
and
it
was
a
pity
magnus
would
not
be
present
at
the
wedding
toward
the
mirk
of
night
she
went
to
bed
and
then
the
snow
was
still
falling
she
thought
of
magnus
traveling
over
the
desert
and
wondered
why
he
had
gone
away
just
then
perhaps
it
was
because
he
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
their
happiness
hers
and
oscar
s
poor
magnus
but
the
memory
of
magnus
was
whirled
away
in
a
cloud
of
other
thoughts
the
wedding
the
wedding
presents
the
and
oscar
always
oscar
and
then
the
tired
eyelids
of
her
mind
closed
in
peace
and
with
all
the
world
and
she
slept
the
last
sleep
of
her
maidenhood
thora
thora
well
i
declare
the
girl
is
still
sleeping
on
her
too
thora
thora
thora
awoke
with
a
start
at
the
calling
and
knocking
at
her
door
leaping
out
of
bed
she
ran
to
the
window
and
parted
the
curtains
it
was
broad
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
over
the
snow
and
all
the
world
was
white
she
opened
the
door
the
and
dressmakers
trooped
into
the
room
and
from
that
moment
onward
for
several
hours
the
universe
was
a
chaos
without
form
and
void
in
which
all
talked
at
once
and
everybody
ran
up
against
everybody
else
and
thora
ate
her
breakfast
while
walking
about
or
being
fitted
on
but
the
dress
and
the
dressing
were
finished
at
length
and
aunt
margret
was
called
up
to
look
nobody
in
iceland
had
ever
seen
such
a
bridal
costume
the
silk
kirtle
the
crown
the
faldur
the
veil
and
the
blue
plush
cloak
isn
t
she
beautiful
margret
said
the
maids
whereupon
aunt
margret
whose
eyes
were
glistening
behind
her
spectacles
said
talk
about
helga
tut
then
the
cathedral
bells
began
to
ring
and
a
hush
fell
on
everybody
thora
went
slowly
and
found
her
father
looking
taller
than
ever
in
a
new
silk
hat
waiting
for
her
in
the
hall
and
silvertop
standing
ready
in
the
street
with
a
of
red
plush
and
gilt
there
were
a
few
jests
a
few
laughs
a
few
furtive
tears
and
then
they
started
off
the
snow
underfoot
was
as
dry
and
soft
as
flour
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
pony
could
be
made
to
walk
sedately
from
the
moment
they
reached
the
cathedral
it
was
all
like
a
dream
to
thora
a
beautiful
such
as
she
had
dreamt
sometimes
when
she
thought
she
was
dead
and
her
happy
soul
was
entering
heaven
the
bridesmaids
were
waiting
in
the
porch
helga
looking
wondrously
beautiful
in
an
english
dress
and
two
former
in
iceland
costume
thora
who
was
moving
as
in
a
vision
felt
somebody
taking
off
her
plush
cloak
and
then
the
bells
stopped
and
the
organ
began
at
the
next
moment
the
choir
was
singing
a
hymn
the
usual
hymn
when
god
the
father
led
the
first
of
brides
and
then
she
was
going
up
the
aisle
leaning
on
her
father
s
arm
she
had
never
seen
so
many
faces
since
the
day
she
was
confirmed
they
seemed
to
move
past
her
and
they
made
her
almost
dizzy
she
remembered
how
at
other
weddings
the
congregation
had
watched
for
the
bride
and
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
supernatural
thing
she
s
coming
here
she
comes
she
herself
was
the
bride
now
and
the
people
were
craning
their
necks
to
see
her
thora
could
feel
their
smiling
faces
and
she
knew
that
her
own
face
was
smiling
she
could
hear
what
the
people
were
saying
as
she
passed
them
dear
thora
how
lovely
she
looks
i
m
satisfied
now
and
i
don
t
care
if
i
go
i
only
wanted
to
see
how
thora
looked
in
the
kirtle
and
meanwhile
the
voices
of
the
choir
were
coming
down
from
the
gallery
as
from
the
sky
and
floating
round
and
round
her
at
the
top
of
the
nave
oscar
was
waiting
so
perfectly
dressed
so
handsome
so
with
a
fair
young
man
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
the
governor
very
solemn
and
stately
with
his
hair
and
beard
the
hymn
came
to
an
end
the
organ
died
down
and
thora
found
herself
standing
by
oscar
s
side
at
the
foot
of
the
chancel
steps
with
the
old
bishop
in
his
pleated
black
gown
and
white
ruff
at
the
top
of
them
there
was
a
rustle
behind
her
then
there
was
silence
and
the
bishop
began
to
speak
my
children
he
said
when
long
ago
god
the
father
led
the
first
of
brides
to
the
first
of
men
in
the
beautiful
garden
of
eden
he
linked
their
hands
together
in
love
and
that
was
the
first
marriage
since
then
he
has
carried
on
the
human
story
by
the
same
sweet
means
and
love
is
still
the
bond
that
binds
man
to
woman
and
woman
to
man
my
children
said
the
bishop
again
he
was
speaking
to
her
and
oscar
you
come
here
to
be
made
man
and
wife
and
because
you
love
one
another
god
is
willing
to
join
your
hands
in
holy
wedlock
for
he
blesses
and
sanctifies
no
other
union
whether
of
wealth
or
worldly
advantage
or
any
other
interest
whatsoever
we
know
you
both
my
children
we
who
are
gathered
here
have
watched
the
flower
of
your
affection
bud
and
bloom
and
now
we
pray
to
god
that
you
may
be
true
to
the
vows
you
are
to
make
always
bearing
each
other
s
burdens
forgiving
each
other
s
faults
and
cherishing
the
human
love
that
is
a
symbol
of
the
love
divine
my
daughter
love
him
who
is
to
be
your
husband
let
him
find
on
your
breast
his
solace
for
every
sorrow
whatever
the
world
may
do
to
him
and
whatever
the
world
may
say
my
son
love
her
who
is
to
be
your
wife
there
is
nothing
nobler
in
this
imperfect
existence
no
sight
more
sweet
and
heavenly
than
when
a
good
girl
leaves
the
father
who
loves
her
and
the
home
where
she
has
been
happy
and
says
to
him
who
is
to
be
her
husband
the
past
was
beautiful
but
i
trust
the
future
all
to
be
worthy
of
that
trust
my
son
be
strong
be
brave
be
faithful
and
he
who
knows
our
weaknesses
having
trodden
the
earth
before
us
will
bear
you
up
if
your
feet
should
falter
be
companions
to
each
other
in
the
journey
of
this
world
my
dear
ones
and
if
it
should
please
god
to
give
you
children
let
them
be
bonds
to
bind
you
closer
together
above
all
love
one
another
for
that
is
the
first
commandment
and
may
he
who
gave
it
guard
and
guide
you
through
all
the
thorny
paths
of
life
the
bishop
s
voice
became
tremulous
toward
the
end
and
when
he
finished
there
was
some
coughing
and
blowing
of
noses
among
the
congregation
oscar
too
was
breathing
heavily
by
thora
s
side
and
helga
was
trampling
on
her
train
but
thora
herself
was
as
calm
as
a
trustful
child
at
the
next
moment
she
was
kneeling
by
oscar
s
side
on
the
communion
steps
just
where
they
had
knelt
as
children
to
be
confirmed
and
the
bishop
was
administering
the
vows
there
was
a
breathless
hush
in
the
crowded
cathedral
during
this
solemn
and
beautiful
ceremony
a
ceremony
for
ever
new
for
ever
old
for
ever
awful
the
consecration
of
the
man
to
the
woman
the
woman
to
the
man
for
better
or
for
worse
in
sickness
and
in
health
till
death
us
do
part
oscar
was
still
breathing
heavily
but
thora
felt
too
happy
to
be
agitated
too
sure
to
be
afraid
when
the
bishop
put
their
hands
together
and
laid
his
own
hand
on
the
top
of
them
she
felt
oscar
s
hand
tremble
and
his
pulse
throb
and
she
wanted
to
calm
and
comfort
him
but
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
for
they
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
one
of
the
assistant
clergy
was
giving
out
a
hymn
guide
thy
children
father
guide
them
through
the
thorny
paths
of
life
the
choir
began
it
but
the
congregation
joined
in
and
all
the
voices
seemed
to
quiver
with
emotion
thora
felt
herself
carried
away
far
away
but
still
she
was
holding
oscar
s
hand
she
thought
she
could
hear
magnus
s
voice
among
the
voices
behind
her
the
deep
voice
she
used
to
hear
on
those
evenings
so
long
ago
poor
magnus
but
then
he
could
have
had
no
joy
of
her
so
it
was
better
even
for
him
it
was
something
of
a
descent
when
the
hymn
ended
and
the
bishop
shook
hands
with
her
and
the
governor
followed
his
example
and
the
bridesmaids
came
up
and
kissed
her
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
congregation
but
oscar
gave
her
his
arm
and
as
they
moved
down
the
nave
the
organ
and
choir
began
again
o
perfect
love
all
human
thought
transcending
lowly
we
kneel
in
prayer
before
thy
throne
she
was
now
sure
she
could
hear
magnus
and
looking
up
at
the
organ
loft
she
saw
him
yes
he
was
there
he
was
in
the
choir
he
had
come
back
from
the
northlands
to
sing
at
her
wedding
that
theirs
may
be
the
joy
that
knows
no
ending
whom
thou
for
evermore
dost
join
in
one
she
had
only
one
glance
at
his
face
but
she
saw
it
plainly
she
had
never
seen
it
like
that
before
so
broken
up
and
so
soft
yet
so
strong
and
brave
his
eyes
were
steadfastly
fixed
on
his
music
book
and
he
was
swaying
a
little
and
singing
as
with
all
his
might
grant
them
the
joy
which
brightens
earthly
sorrow
grant
them
the
peace
which
calms
all
earthly
strife
but
magnus
was
whirled
away
from
her
in
a
moment
for
the
people
whispered
as
she
was
going
past
dear
thora
god
bless
our
thora
oscar
was
bowing
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
and
the
people
were
talking
to
him
also
how
handsome
he
looks
he
looks
as
if
he
could
take
care
of
her
too
take
care
of
her
oscar
they
were
back
in
the
porch
at
length
and
somebody
was
putting
her
plush
cloak
over
her
shoulders
silvertop
was
standing
outside
and
hans
the
sailor
in
his
new
sleeve
waistcoat
was
giving
him
water
out
of
his
pail
oscar
lifted
her
to
the
saddle
and
they
turned
their
faces
homeward
the
bells
began
to
ring
again
a
merry
peal
and
then
at
last
thora
s
tears
began
to
flow
how
good
everybody
had
been
to
her
it
was
all
for
oscar
s
sake
how
sweet
to
think
they
were
good
to
her
for
the
sake
of
oscar
thank
god
for
oscar
anna
and
aunt
margret
were
at
the
door
of
the
factor
s
house
to
receive
them
they
kissed
thora
and
called
her
stephenson
and
then
took
her
to
change
when
she
came
down
again
the
friends
invited
to
the
wedding
feast
were
coming
in
quickly
taking
off
their
snowshoes
shaking
hands
with
oscar
and
talking
all
at
once
the
table
was
laid
in
the
double
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
betrothal
the
factor
sat
at
the
head
with
oscar
on
his
right
just
in
the
place
where
he
had
trodden
on
helga
s
photograph
and
thora
on
his
left
where
magnus
had
sat
on
the
low
seat
beside
his
mother
while
the
governor
faced
the
factor
with
anna
and
aunt
margret
at
either
side
of
him
and
the
bishop
the
sheriff
and
the
doctor
between
helga
sat
midway
down
the
table
with
neils
finsen
on
one
side
of
her
and
the
rector
on
the
other
thora
was
bashful
but
bright
reddening
a
little
with
maidenly
reserve
when
pointed
remarks
were
made
to
her
but
filling
the
room
with
musical
laughter
during
the
meal
nearly
everybody
raised
his
glass
to
her
and
at
the
end
of
it
the
governor
rose
bowed
to
her
down
the
table
with
a
stately
grace
and
began
to
speak
i
rise
said
the
governor
to
propose
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
we
are
all
happy
in
the
marriage
which
has
just
been
celebrated
and
no
one
can
be
more
happy
than
myself
it
had
been
for
many
years
the
dearest
hope
of
my
heart
that
the
friendship
between
factor
neilsen
and
myself
might
be
cemented
in
our
children
by
a
still
closer
bond
your
health
old
friend
interrupted
the
factor
raising
his
glass
and
the
governor
stopped
to
drink
with
him
time
was
perhaps
he
continued
when
i
feared
lest
this
hope
might
be
frustrated
no
no
said
the
factor
while
thora
dropped
her
head
anna
sighed
audibly
and
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
as
if
the
spirit
of
some
one
who
was
not
present
had
passed
through
the
room
but
sweet
is
the
bliss
that
follows
bale
said
the
governor
and
thank
god
we
are
now
of
one
mind
and
one
family
when
the
glasses
of
the
company
had
ceased
to
jingle
the
governor
went
on
to
speak
of
thora
she
has
always
been
like
a
daughter
in
our
house
and
now
she
is
our
daughter
indeed
we
have
loved
her
all
her
life
and
we
have
given
her
the
best
we
had
to
give
to
any
one
our
son
our
favorite
son
the
idol
of
our
hopes
and
the
pride
of
our
hearts
god
bless
both
of
them
as
soon
as
the
factor
had
done
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
print
handkerchief
he
rose
with
a
laugh
and
said
stem
before
stern
when
the
sea
gets
up
and
i
m
not
much
used
to
pulling
backward
but
i
m
with
the
governor
in
thanking
god
that
the
storm
that
threatened
has
blown
over
and
we
are
sailing
in
smooth
water
as
for
oscar
he
has
been
my
godson
ever
since
he
was
anything
and
he
has
become
my
son
and
i
could
not
wish
for
a
better
and
now
said
the
factor
as
soon
as
he
was
allowed
to
go
on
a
small
promise
kept
is
better
than
a
big
one
forgotten
and
i
m
going
to
keep
a
little
promise
which
i
made
on
the
day
of
the
betrothal
perhaps
some
of
you
wouldn
t
think
it
but
i
believe
in
young
people
enjoying
their
youth
while
they
ve
got
any
i
managed
to
miss
mine
somehow
and
it
s
been
work
work
work
with
me
all
my
days
the
same
with
the
governor
it
s
been
work
work
work
with
him
too
and
we
haven
t
had
a
holiday
between
us
but
we
are
going
to
have
a
holiday
now
we
re
going
to
travel
to
the
sunny
south
lands
where
the
ground
and
the
sea
aren
t
white
like
this
and
that
the
factor
waved
his
hands
toward
the
windows
front
and
back
yes
we
re
going
to
see
the
world
in
our
old
age
the
governor
and
i
but
it
s
got
to
be
with
eyes
that
are
better
than
ours
are
now
the
eyes
of
our
children
what
s
more
continued
the
factor
when
the
company
were
again
quiet
we
re
not
going
to
grudge
the
expense
either
and
if
oscar
will
look
under
his
bottom
plate
he
ll
find
a
little
oil
that
will
grease
the
wheels
on
the
way
oscar
lifted
his
fruit
plate
and
took
up
two
checks
and
when
the
toast
had
been
honored
he
rose
to
reply
nobody
had
ever
before
seen
him
so
pale
so
nervous
or
so
serious
i
thank
the
governor
and
the
factor
he
said
for
the
splendid
present
they
have
given
us
so
much
more
than
we
can
possibly
require
on
our
journey
i
thank
you
all
for
coming
to
our
wedding
it
is
so
pleasant
to
be
surrounded
by
the
people
who
have
known
us
all
our
lives
find
your
wife
among
your
friends
says
one
of
our
sagas
i
have
found
mine
almost
in
my
family
and
i
trust
the
two
branches
now
made
one
may
never
be
divided
as
the
result
of
what
we
have
done
this
morning
there
was
some
applause
and
when
oscar
began
again
his
voice
faltered
and
broke
i
thank
the
bishop
too
he
said
for
the
words
the
wise
and
touching
words
he
spoke
in
marrying
us
i
know
that
love
love
is
the
only
foundation
of
a
true
marriage
and
i
i
trust
my
marriage
is
a
true
one
i
do
not
love
my
wife
as
much
as
i
ought
as
much
as
she
deserves
i
can
never
do
that
it
is
impossible
but
i
hope
to
love
her
more
and
more
as
time
goes
on
and
to
fly
from
every
temptation
to
love
her
less
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
the
dear
good
girl
who
has
given
herself
to
me
but
i
will
try
so
to
live
that
she
may
never
regret
it
often
forgive
the
woman
s
faults
says
another
of
our
sagas
but
a
truer
word
in
this
case
would
be
forgive
the
man
s
and
i
pray
god
my
wife
may
never
have
too
much
to
forgive
when
oscar
sat
down
the
men
thought
his
speech
had
been
a
little
affected
and
but
there
was
not
a
woman
in
the
room
who
did
not
want
to
leap
up
and
kiss
him
thora
was
openly
wiping
her
eyes
but
her
face
was
one
high
noon
of
enjoyment
and
in
the
buzz
which
followed
the
silence
aunt
margret
called
across
to
her
stephenson
you
had
better
take
care
of
your
husband
or
some
of
these
young
women
will
run
away
with
him
there
were
other
toasts
the
governor
the
factor
and
finally
the
bridesmaids
proposed
by
the
rector
in
a
playful
speech
they
say
a
kiss
isn
t
the
same
thing
from
all
women
he
said
and
being
an
old
bachelor
i
know
nothing
about
that
but
the
young
fellow
on
my
left
the
rector
indicated
neils
finsen
who
has
a
right
to
consider
himself
the
best
man
in
iceland
has
confessed
to
me
in
a
whisper
that
he
finds
one
of
the
bridesmaids
so
charming
and
beautiful
that
if
he
had
been
in
oscar
s
place
and
compelled
by
a
law
to
choose
between
the
factor
s
two
daughters
he
would
have
cut
off
to
some
eastern
country
where
he
could
have
married
both
everybody
laughed
and
looked
at
helga
who
had
herself
been
laughing
rather
hysterically
and
looking
at
oscar
all
through
dinner
and
then
thora
who
was
overflowing
with
happiness
glanced
down
at
her
sister
and
remembered
the
great
scheme
she
had
conceived
to
make
amends
for
mistrusting
and
suspecting
her
now
was
the
moment
to
carry
it
into
effect
now
that
she
was
queen
in
her
little
kingdom
and
half
bold
half
shy
she
rose
from
her
seat
put
her
arms
about
her
father
s
neck
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
the
factor
s
face
straightened
for
a
moment
then
broadened
again
and
he
said
but
what
does
oscar
say
oscar
will
be
sure
to
agree
said
thora
and
she
whispered
in
her
father
s
ear
again
well
i
m
not
going
back
on
my
word
i
m
willing
but
you
must
ask
oscar
then
laughing
and
reddening
thora
crept
up
behind
oscar
and
whispered
in
his
ear
also
while
looking
sideways
down
at
helga
as
oscar
listened
his
face
became
serious
and
he
said
but
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
wish
it
thora
yes
yes
yes
said
thora
laughing
and
blushing
for
now
the
eyes
of
the
whole
company
were
on
her
let
us
talk
of
it
said
oscar
no
no
now
said
thora
but
perhaps
helga
herself
began
oscar
and
then
he
stopped
whereupon
helga
hearing
her
own
name
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
what
is
that
about
helga
yes
what
is
it
said
several
voices
at
once
and
then
the
factor
explained
thora
wants
to
have
her
sister
to
accompany
them
on
their
tour
and
she
is
trying
to
persuade
oscar
there
were
some
unconvincing
cries
of
why
not
and
splendid
and
then
there
was
silence
broken
only
by
thora
s
voice
saying
please
oscar
please
it
was
the
last
thing
oscar
could
have
expected
to
have
temptation
thrown
in
his
way
at
the
moment
when
he
was
trying
to
escape
from
it
to
have
the
of
passion
opened
afresh
after
he
had
struggled
so
hard
to
dam
it
and
to
have
this
done
by
thora
herself
in
her
blind
unselfishness
and
innocent
joy
as
if
the
powers
of
hell
were
making
game
of
her
but
the
company
were
waiting
for
oscar
s
answer
and
not
to
betray
himself
he
tried
to
escape
by
banter
i
m
not
like
neils
i
don
t
want
both
of
you
he
said
but
still
the
pleading
coaxing
voice
was
at
his
ear
saying
please
oscar
please
please
and
when
oscar
continued
to
hesitate
the
rector
said
tut
tut
oscar
refusing
your
wife
s
first
request
is
a
bad
beginning
i
m
not
refusing
said
oscar
and
if
helga
herself
really
and
truly
thinks
she
would
like
to
go
with
us
would
you
like
to
go
helga
asked
the
factor
and
then
there
was
another
moment
s
hesitation
in
which
helga
biting
her
lower
lip
with
a
fierceness
which
betrayed
the
struggle
in
her
soul
looked
across
at
oscar
as
if
trying
to
read
in
his
face
what
her
answer
was
to
be
tell
her
to
say
yes
oscar
said
thora
yes
said
helga
and
at
the
next
moment
thora
was
clapping
her
hands
in
triumphant
delight
and
making
the
room
ring
with
her
laughter
neils
finsen
had
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
the
servants
were
clearing
the
table
to
make
way
for
dancing
when
anna
came
up
behind
thora
and
whispered
somebody
outside
wishes
to
see
you
thora
is
it
perhaps
yes
dear
said
anna
and
thora
followed
her
out
of
the
room
magnus
was
waiting
in
the
hall
dressed
in
snow
stockings
and
a
long
cape
overcoat
rough
and
worn
and
belted
about
the
waist
his
face
was
stamped
with
the
deep
lines
which
in
a
strong
man
stand
for
resignation
and
in
a
weak
one
for
despair
thora
thought
she
had
never
seen
him
look
so
big
and
brawny
but
his
voice
when
he
spoke
to
her
was
as
soft
as
a
woman
s
and
he
broke
into
the
sunniest
of
smiles
she
closed
the
door
of
the
to
shut
out
the
sound
of
the
piano
and
then
came
forward
and
held
out
her
hand
feeling
little
and
weak
in
her
kirtle
and
the
bridal
crown
across
her
forehead
i
came
to
say
and
to
wish
you
a
good
voyage
he
said
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
said
thora
i
heard
you
had
gone
away
and
i
was
afraid
i
was
going
to
miss
you
i
ve
brought
you
this
for
a
wedding
present
said
magnus
taking
up
from
the
hall
table
a
large
white
bear
s
skin
which
thora
had
not
noticed
before
what
a
magnificent
rug
said
thora
is
it
a
good
one
said
magnus
it
is
perfectly
beautiful
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
it
must
have
cost
you
a
fortune
no
not
a
great
deal
i
bought
it
in
the
northlands
then
it
was
to
get
this
that
you
went
there
yes
in
the
winter
too
such
a
long
cold
journey
i
am
strong
thora
i
never
feel
the
cold
his
sad
eyes
were
glistening
and
thora
s
throat
was
thick
i
shall
use
it
on
the
ship
and
in
the
train
and
everywhere
she
said
and
whenever
i
use
it
i
will
always
think
of
you
will
you
indeed
i
will
but
we
are
going
south

sun
will
do
you
good
and
you
will
see
the
fruit
and
the
flowers
growing
it
will
be
beautiful
will
it
not
the
piano
was
becoming
louder
and
there
was
a
sound
of
shuffling
feet
the
people
in
the
were
beginning
to
dance
and
what
do
you
think
helga
is
going
with
us
said
thora
helga
didn
t
anna
tell
you
is
helga

you
to
italy
oh
yes
and
we
are
delighted
to
have
her
she
s
so
clever
and
bright
oscar
can
never
be
dull
for
a
moment
while
helga
is
with
us
the
grave
face
looked
sideways
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
in
a
still
gentler
voice
i
hope
you
ll
be
happy
on
your
journey
thora
i
m
sure
i
shall
we
shall
all
be
happy
we
sail
by
the
laura
morning
so
mother
told
me
i
ve
been
taking
your
baggage
aboard
and
seeing
to
your
cabin
and
you
have
been
doing
that
while
we
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
you
thora
but
magnus
you
ought
to
have
been
here
by
rights
oscar
always
wished
it
in
fact
he
wanted
you
to
be
his
best
man
oscar
did
indeed
he
did
but
you
couldn
t
be
found
because
you
had
gone
on
your
journey
over
the
sound
of
the
music
and
the
dancing
the
governor
s
voice
came
from
within
mingled
with
the
factor
s
hearty
laughter
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
i
was
away
said
magnus
the
old
people
have
never
forgiven
me
for
what
i
did
and
if
they
ever
came
to
suspect
that
somebody
else
was
responsible
he
stopped
and
then
thora
dropped
her
eyes
and
said
i
was
so
glad
you
were
in
the
cathedral
it
was
beautiful
said
magnus
you
have
no
feeling
against
oscar
now
not
now
when
i
saw
you
kneeling
together
at
the
communion
rails
i
thought
of
the
day
when
we
all
knelt
there
and
then
then
oscar
was
my
little
brother
once
again
magnus
won
t
you
won
t
you
kiss
me
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
she
held
her
sweet
face
up
to
him
pure
as
a
saint
s
and
wet
with
tears
and
he
opened
his
great
arms
and
gathered
the
little
white
figure
to
his
breast
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
under
the
bridal
crown
little
girl
and
god
bless
you
and
make
you
very
happy
but
if
you
ever
want
me
say
come
and
i
ll
come
to
you
if
it
s
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
earth
thora
began
to
cry
audibly
and
magnus
bustled
about
and
made
for
the
door
he
must
be
off
he
had
a
long
journey
before
him
and
then
silvertop
is
outside
i
must
not
keep
him
waiting
silvertop
mother
told
me
to
take
care
of
him
until
you
return
so
i
m
taking
him
back
to
the
farm
let
me
say
to
him
said
thora
magnus
covered
her
from
head
to
foot
in
the
bear
s
skin
and
led
her
down
the
steps
to
the
street
it
was
dark
but
the
stars
were
out
and
the
northern
lights
were
cleaving
the
sky
as
with
the
sweep
of
a
mighty
saber
all
was
white
and
silent
save
for
the
deadened
beat
of
the
piano
and
the
thud
of
the
feet
of
the
dancers
two
horses
saddled
and
bridled
stood
quietly
in
the
snow
with
their
reins
hanging
over
their
heads
and
magnus
mounting
one
of
them
said
this
is
golden
mane
silvertop
s
big
brother
thora
found
her
own
pony
stroked
its
ears
and
kissed
its
nose
and
then
fled
back
to
the
door
out
of
the
frosty
air
good
brothers
go
well
together
we
ll
be
home
by
midnight
cried
magnus
thora
watched
them
go
a
glittering
shaft
of
the
aurora
lit
up
the
three
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
magnus
riding
golden
mane
and
silvertop
with
an
empty
saddle
running
briskly
beside
him
when
thora
returned
to
the
oscar
and
helga
both
with
sparkling
eyes
and
flushed
faces
were
waltzing
vigorously
then
thora
herself
danced
with
the
governor
the
factor
the
hector
and
of
course
with
oscar
but
the
room
grew
hot
and
stuffy
too
full
of
excitement
and
after
a
while
thora
became
pale
and
faint
seeing
this
after
aunt
margret
had
called
attention
to
it
oscar
began
to
say
it
was
time
to
break
up
the
young
men
bantered
him
want
to
get
rid
of
us
eh
and
helga
who
grew
more
and
more
hysterical
protested
that
the
evening
was
still
young
but
oscar
sent
his
bride
to
prepare
for
the
journey
to
her
husband
s
house
let
us
all
take
her
home
then
said
one
of
the
bridesmaids
and
when
thora
reappeared
muffled
up
for
her
night
walk
with
only
eyes
nose
and
mouth
visible
she
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
merry
girls
similarly
bandaged
and
chirping
over
her
like
linnets
in
spring
at
last
the
final
moment
came
when
thora
had
to
leave
her
father
s
house
for
good
and
then
aunt
margret
whose
face
had
become
grotesquely
long
and
watery
broke
down
altogether
it
s
no
use
she
said
i
m
losing
her
and
i
don
t
know
what
they
ll
do
with
my
precious
now
nonsense
margret
said
the
factor
oscar
will
take
care
of
her
he
d
better
or
i
ll
murder
him
said
aunt
margret
and
the
idea
of
aunt
margret
murdering
anybody
was
so
amusing
to
the
company
that
they
broke
up
merrily
the
factor
s
family
went
to
the
door
to
see
them
off
and
helga
who
was
hot
with
dancing
and
excitement
but
wore
no
wraps
stood
on
the
top
of
the
steps
holding
a
lamp
above
her
head
to
light
them
down
the
road
it
was
a
paraffin
lamp
with
a
glass
reservoir
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
any
warning
take
care
helga
do
take
care
said
oscar
but
she
only
cried
good
night
pleasant
dreams
and
continued
to
wave
the
flickering
lamp
above
her
head
helga
for
mercy
s
sake
helga
shouted
oscar
and
thora
said
yes
dear
don
t
let
us
have
an
accident
on
our
the
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
cried
helga
and
she
sent
a
ringing
hysterical
laugh
after
them
as
they
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
wedding
party
went
off
in
two
batches
oscar
in
the
midst
of
the
young
men
whose
arms
were
round
his
shoulders
and
thora
in
the
midst
of
the
young
women
who
were
holding
her
by
the
waist
and
stopping
at
intervals
to
whisper
mischievous
messages
in
her
ears
the
crisp
snow
crackled
under
their
feet
and
the
starry
sky
with
its
northern
lights
pulsed
and
throbbed
like
the
hearts
in
their
bosoms
when
they
came
to
the
gate
of
government
house
somebody
suggested
that
oscar
as
a
zealous
sagaman
ought
to
carry
out
the
ancient
custom
of
lifting
his
bride
across
the
threshold
and
then
to
thora
s
delight
amid
a
squealing
chorus
of
laughter
oscar
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
into
the
house
where
anna
who
had
gone
on
ahead
smuggled
her
while
the
others
went
into
the
to
drink
the
last
toast
before
parting
a
bright
fire
was
burning
in
the
bridal
chamber
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
bed
was
laid
open
and
the
room
looked
like
a
white
nest
of
eiderdown
when
thora
with
a
fluttering
heart
stepped
into
it
what
a
day
it
has
been
she
said
hasn
t
it
said
anna
closing
the
door
behind
them
well
i
can
always
say
i
had
a
wonderful
can
t
i
indeed
you
can
a
woman
has
only
two
days
in
her
life
that
are
her
own
her
very
own
and
her
is
one
of
them
and
what
is
the
other
day
anna
the
other
oh
the
other
day
is
too
far
away
for
you
to
think
about
it
yet
but
all
the
days
between
belong
to
somebody
else
her
children
or
her
husband
but
how
sweet
how
beautiful
to
live
in
your
husband
to
give
up
everything
to
him
your
life
yourself
everything
there
s
happiness
in
that
isn
t
there
anna
indeed
there
is
my
dear
and
pain
too
perhaps
but
there
s
something
better
in
this
life
than
happiness
thora
and
that
s
blessedness
you
know
this
made
thora
think
of
magnus
but
she
heard
oscar
laughing
in
the
room
below
and
soon
forgot
everything
else
in
a
delicious
shuddering
which
suddenly
came
over
her
anna
helped
her
to
undress
and
when
the
crown
and
the
kirtle
were
laid
aside
she
moved
about
for
some
moments
without
speaking
then
she
said
softly
will
you
go
to
bed
now
dearest
or
shall
i
give
you
your
give
me
my
said
thora
faintly
anna
moved
about
on
tiptoe
a
moment
or
two
longer
turning
the
lamp
down
and
fixing
the
shade
then
she
opened
the
door
and
stood
for
an
instant
on
the
threshold
looking
back
at
thora
where
she
sat
combing
out
her
hair
before
the
stove
all
at
once
her
homely
face
became
young
and
beautiful
by
the
magic
of
a
memory
of
her
own
and
going
softly
back
she
kissed
thora
without
saying
a
word
and
then
crept
silently
out
of
the
room
left
alone
thora
looked
timidly
around
her
and
seeing
things
of
oscar
s
lying
among
her
own
she
felt
a
new
and
still
more
delicious
sense
of
happiness
during
the
days
preceding
the
wedding
she
had
thought
that
as
soon
as
the
service
in
the
cathedral
had
come
to
an
end
and
she
was
oscar
s
wife
a
mysterious
change
would
come
over
her
but
that
had
not
been
so
and
all
day
long
she
had
felt
quite
the
same
but
now
it
was
different
and
in
this
room
she
had
become
another
being
not
herself
only
but
oscar
also
it
was
very
sweet
and
beautiful
but
it
was
a
little
frightening
too
and
to
ease
her
heart
she
got
into
bed
and
covered
up
her
face
she
could
hear
the
company
breaking
up
below
and
a
little
later
she
heard
their
footsteps
crunching
the
snow
under
her
window
which
fronted
the
road
they
stood
there
and
sang
a
bridal
song
it
was
the
song
of
the
two
roses
the
winter
was
cold
and
the
ground
was
white
but
two
roses
of
love
still
grew
in
the
garden
of
god
the
frost
could
not
freeze
the
two
roses
of
love
for
they
were
warmed
by
the
air
of
heaven
the
sun
could
not
scorch
the
two
roses
of
love
for
they
were
watered
from
the
well
of
life
two
roses
of
love
on
a
single
stem
two
roses
of
love
in
two
fond
young
hearts
two
roses
of
love
and
joy
when
the
song
came
to
an
end
there
was
some
merry
giggling
under
the
window
followed
by
shouts
of
good
night
thora
happy
dreams
then
as
the
company
went
off
they
started
the
bridal
song
again
and
in
her
mind
s
eye
thora
could
see
them
going
back
to
the
town
arm
in
arm
young
girls
and
young
men
thora
listened
to
the
voices
dying
down
the
street
and
for
a
moment
all
life
seemed
to
be
set
to
the
music
of
love
oscar
and
she
would
be
children
always
never
growing
older
but
rambling
hand
in
hand
through
a
flowery
world
where
everybody
loved
them
and
they
loved
everybody
and
there
could
be
no
real
trouble
because
love
was
all
in
all
but
just
then
the
cathedral
clock
struck
eleven
and
she
remembered
magnus
she
could
see
him
crossing
the
desolate
white
heath
under
the
shooting
stream
of
the
northern
lights
a
lonesome
man
riding
one
horse
while
another
with
an
empty
saddle
was
running
by
his
side
poor
magnus
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
voices
died
away
in
the
distance
and
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
in
the
cozy
nest
a
warm
muffled
secret
kind
of
silence
broken
by
nothing
but
the
underthrob
of
the
ceaseless
sea
thora
closed
her
eyes
and
held
her
breath
how
happy
she
was
she
was
trembling
like
a
bird
caught
and
held
in
the
hand
but
even
her
fear
was
full
of
happiness
at
the
next
moment
there
was
a
noiseless
footstep
on
the
floor
a
sense
of
somebody
in
the
room
and
then
oscar
was
leaning
over
her
and
kissing
her
on
the
lips
ah
that
spring
should
vanish
with
the
rose
youth
s
manuscript
should
close
nightingale
that
in
the
branches
sang
whence
and
whither
flown
again
who
knows
the
wedding
being
over
and
the
wedding
party
gone
anna
went
on
a
visit
to
magnus
in
order
to
bear
him
company
during
the
first
weeks
of
his
first
winter
and
to
see
that
his
house
was
in
order
the
farm
was
miles
from
the
capital
not
far
from
the
scene
of
the
and
in
the
middle
of
the
great
plain
of
thingvellir
an
historic
spot
formerly
the
place
of
the
icelandic
parliament
for
the
neglected
mount
of
laws
may
still
be
seen
there
there
were
only
two
houses
on
the
plain
the
farmhouse
and
the
parsonage
with
its
little
church
beside
it
the
farmhouse
was
the
larger
of
the
two
and
being
on
the
line
of
road
from
the
capital
to
the
chief
market
of
the
northland
it
had
become
a
resting
place
for
travelers
the
had
belonged
to
anna
s
family
for
many
generations
and
her
father
had
been
the
last
to
hold
it
he
was
a
worthy
man
silent
and
serious
much
like
magnus
in
personal
character
but
he
left
the
place
badly
embarrassed
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
defaulting
factor
after
his
daughter
married
he
lost
his
wife
and
then
he
died
suddenly
people
said
of
drink
since
then
the
estate
had
been
twenty
years
in
the
hands
of
a
steward
but
the
governor
had
paid
off
the
mortgage
out
of
the
savings
of
his
salary
and
the
farm
was
free
it
was
an
endless
delight
to
anna
to
bring
the
place
back
to
its
former
condition
she
began
with
the
sleeping
accommodation
for
sin
comes
with
a
laugh
she
said
but
goes
with
a
cry
the
shepherd
and
his
wife
she
put
in
the
upper
bedroom
the
badstofa
the
maids
in
the
lower
one
and
the
in
the
loft
each
of
the
rooms
was
under
its
own
roof
and
the
homestead
as
a
whole
was
less
like
a
single
house
than
a
group
of
houses
or
like
a
gipsy
encampment
with
its
peaked
tents
going
off
in
different
directions
the
principal
apartment
was
a
large
square
hall
with
two
opening
out
of
it
magnus
was
to
sleep
in
one
of
these
guest
rooms
except
when
both
were
wanted
for
travelers
and
then
he
was
to
lie
on
a
mattress
stretched
on
the
floor
anna
inspected
the
kitchen
the
elt
house
and
the
storehouse
the
skemma
examined
the
winter
s
stock
of
potted
meat
and
dried
and
salted
cod
and
whale
and
put
a
lock
on
the
bur
for
seldom
does
the
starve
in
the
larder
she
said
finally
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
hall
which
was
the
general
living
room
and
furnished
it
afresh
with
a
settle
an
armchair
a
bornholme
clock
and
a
big
german
stove
as
a
finishing
stroke
she
hung
two
large
photographs
on
the
walls
one
of
the
governor
the
other
of
herself
the
governor
was
gorgeous
in
his
uniform
but
she
was
homely
in
her
black
hufa
and
on
second
thoughts
she
would
have
taken
her
own
picture
down
but
magnus
said
something
nice
about
it
and
she
allowed
it
to
remain
anna
s
visit
was
a
long
one
but
as
often
as
she
prepared
to
go
saying
home
was
the
best
place
for
the
stupid
magnus
answered
that
in
that
case
gudrun
must
unpack
her
trunk
for
the
governor
could
not
be
expecting
her
in
this
way
she
stayed
at
thingvellir
until
the
snow
began
to
be
honeycombed
by
the
thaw
and
the
ribs
of
the
landscape
to
be
revealed
again
meantime
her
life
at
the
farm
was
simple
and
primitive
and
every
day
had
its
own
duty
before
it
was
light
in
the
morning
she
rang
the
bell
in
the
hall
which
awakened
the
household
and
sent
the
maids
to
the
shippons
and
the
boys
to
the
beasts
in
their
pens
and
when
the
short
day
had
closed
in
she
rang
the
bell
again
for
supper
and
finally
for
prayers
when
the
magnus
now
gave
out
a
hymn
and
read
a
lesson
on
sunday
she
went
to
church
and
met
the
people
who
had
ridden
over
from
the
farms
that
bordered
the
plain
she
sat
in
the
seat
in
front
of
the
communion
rail
with
its
picture
of
christ
in
white
robes
among
warm
eastern
foliage
magnus
sat
in
the
choir
and
put
up
the
figures
on
the
plate
that
gave
the
numbers
of
the
hymns
he
had
little
voice
and
no
music
but
anna
listened
and
was
happy
though
the
nights
were
long
the
household
was
never
idle
while
the
servants
had
to
mend
and
make
blankets
in
their
own
quarters
magnus
would
weave
on
a
loom
he
set
up
in
the
hall
and
his
mother
would
spin
or
knit
stockings
he
was
full
of
great
projects
again
and
though
his
former
schemes
were
impossible
to
him
now
he
had
others
of
equal
consequence
what
iceland
wanted
was
roads
roads
were
the
landmarks
of
civilization
without
roads
the
most
productive
country
in
the
world
could
not
prosper
for
what
was
the
use
of
a
cow
that
gave
much
milk
if
it
kicked
over
the
pail
night
after
night
in
the
pauses
of
the
loom
anna
had
to
listen
to
this
story
and
to
assent
to
the
schemes
that
were
tied
on
to
it
yes
magnus
was
going
to
be
very
comfortable
and
she
could
go
home
in
content
after
all
perhaps
everything
was
for
the
best
she
said
and
if
there
were
only
a
mistress
in
the
house
but
magnus
rattled
at
the
loom
and
nothing
more
was
heard
for
some
moments
john
and
gudrun
are
very
well
in
their
way
but
it
s
thin
blood
that
isn
t
thicker
than
water
and
when
i
go
back
the
loom
rattled
still
louder
but
a
young
man
who
couldn
t
be
satisfied
with
a
girl
like
thora
isn
t
likely
to
find
many
to
his
liking
and
then
the
loom
rattled
louder
than
ever
and
nothing
more
was
said
that
night
at
intervals
during
anna
s
visit
to
the
farm
there
came
news
of
the
wedding
party
the
letters
being
sent
on
by
the
weekly
post
from
government
house
and
from
the
factor
s
the
first
to
come
was
from
england
and
it
was
a
joint
letter
to
everybody
written
by
all
three
of
the
wanderers
oscar
began
it
with
a
playful
review
of
their
journey
from
the
time
of
the
departure
of
the
laura
as
soon
as
we
set
foot
on
the
ship
we
were
told
that
captain
zimsen
had
given
up
his
own
cabin
to
us
and
from
that
hour
to
this
everybody
has
shown
us
boundless
hospitality
especially
father
s
old
college
friends
the
professor
at
oxford
and
the
banker
here
in
london
naturally
we
know
we
owe
everything
to
the
magic
of
the
governor
s
name
and
consequently
i
am
cultivating
an
extraordinary
reverence
for
it
though
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
find
it
more
beautiful
than
i
did
on
the
morning
of
our
wedding
at
the
bottom
of
that
splendid
check
ha
ha
the
mouse
knows
where
to
come
back
for
his
cheese
said
anna
helga
came
next
with
a
glowing
account
of
the
london
theaters
and
the
half
had
not
been
told
me
as
the
big
book
says
and
i
wonder
more
than
ever
why
a
poor
girl
should
be
doomed
to
waste
her
life
in
a
wilderness
when
she
might
live
in
a
world
of
so
many
clever
and
beautiful
people
m
m
it
s
poor
work
pouring
water
on
a
rock
said
anna
thora
came
last
with
a
rather
sad
little
note
it
was
all
very
wonderful
no
doubt
but
she
was
feeling
just
a
wee
bit
did
not
care
so
very
much
for
operas
and
so
oscar
had
to
take
helga
by
herself
i
like
best
to
sit
in
the
window
of
the
hotel
and
look
at
the
crowds
in
the
square
such
multitudes
always
going
and
coming
and
hardly
anybody
ever
speaking
to
anybody
else
that
s
what
strikes
you
at
first
as
most
extraordinary
it
is
so
strange
to
think
that
the
people
in
the
streets
do
not
even
know
each
other
by
sight
and
that
every
young
woman
who
goes
by
has
her
own
family
somewhere
her
own
husband
and
perhaps
her
own
children
and
that
she
is
hurrying
away
to
them
i
don
t
know
why
but
it
makes
me
feel
so
lonely
and
then
i
almost
want
to
be
back
in
my
dear
sweet
homely
old
iceland
magnus
had
to
read
this
letter
aloud
for
anna
was
no
reader
of
handwriting
and
when
he
came
to
thora
s
part
his
voice
thickened
and
broke
the
next
letter
came
from
paris
and
helga
wrote
the
whole
of
it
such
sights
such
luxury
such
gaiety
and
such
dreams
of
dresses
and
then
the
opera
chopin
verdi
wagner
greig
we
are
at
the
opera
every
night
that
is
to
say
oscar
and
i
are
thora
not
caring
very
much
for
music
thora
s
chief
pleasure
is
to
walk
in
the
flower
market
by
the
madeleine
and
watch
the
children
playing
and
look
as
if
she
wished
she
were
one
of
them
just
like
our
thora
said
anna
neils
is
here
neils
finsen
you
know
neils
has
finished
his
course
at
the
musical
college
and
is
connected
in
some
way
with
covent
garden
and
has
come
to
paris
on
managerial
business
he
seems
to
be
getting
along
wonderfully
and
it
makes
me
feel
almost
envious
oh
to
get
on
in
life
to
escape
forever
from
that
grey
sky
and
all
those
freezing
surroundings
what
i
would
give
to
do
it
nothing
should
stand
between
me
and
success
in
life
if
i
only
saw
the
chance
of
it
and
who
knows
perhaps
i
may
some
day
neils
declares
that
my
voice
has
improved
wonderfully
and
i
am
practising
constantly
but
to
have
any
real
opportunity
in
music
one
ought
to
be
here
or
in
london
or
dresden
and
it
is
so
expensive
i
m
nearly
penniless
as
it
is
and
i
am
so
shockingly
dowdy
that
if
some
one
does
not
send
me
the
letter
was
to
the
factor
and
he
had
cut
away
the
end
of
it
m
m
m
m
said
anna
what
the
miss
is
used
to
the
misses
keeps
up
and
then
they
ate
their
supper
of
smoked
mutton
and
black
bread
in
silence
and
rang
the
bell
for
prayers
the
third
letter
from
the
wedding
party
came
from
italy
and
it
was
written
by
oscar
only
the
post
that
brought
it
had
been
delayed
by
a
and
had
sheltered
two
nights
on
the
moss
fell
heath
at
the
the
had
been
completely
buried
and
magnus
and
the
men
had
worked
up
to
their
waists
from
daylight
to
dark
digging
a
way
out
of
the
snow
that
the
beasts
might
be
fed
and
watered
the
world
will
be
white
with
you
in
iceland
but
here
in
italy
the
roses
are
in
bud
and
the
sky
is
blue
and
the
air
is
balmy
what
a
time
we
have
had
of
it
we
came
down
from
venice
the
city
of
silence
and
dream
through
florence
the
city
of
sunshine
and
rome
the
mother
of
cities
to
naples
the
city
of
song
italy
seems
to
set
all
europe
to
music
lovely
and
beloved
italy
if
only
some
one
could
do
the
same
for
iceland
rugged
gaunt
grand
old
iceland
but
wait
only
wait
perhaps
somebody
will
do
it
yet
ah
oscar
oscar
said
anna
it
s
easier
to
count
twelve
mountains
than
to
climb
one
helga
is
enjoying
the
trip
tremendously
out
every
minute
of
the
day
and
making
friends
on
every
side
thora
does
not
seem
so
well
poor
child
and
she
hardly
cares
to
go
about
we
are
going
on
to
the
riviera
next
week
and
thence
back
to
iceland
i
must
of
course
be
home
for
the
opening
of
althing
but
helga
is
grudging
every
day
it
is
now
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
we
have
just
returned
from
a
veglioni
that
is
to
say
a
masque
ball
this
yesterday
being
the
last
of
lent
flowers
streamers
confetti
and
such
dresses
helga
looked
magnificent
in
a
pale
blue
chiffon
of
the
latest
model
and
was
out
of
all
comparison
the
belle
of
the
evening
poor
thora
did
not
care
to
go
so
she
stayed
in
the
hotel
and
went
to
bed
early
magnus
and
his
mother
also
went
to
bed
early
on
the
night
they
read
that
letter
anna
rung
the
bell
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
of
the
hall
and
the
servants
in
their
skin
slippers
and
woolen
stockings
trooped
in
for
prayers
the
lesson
was
the
story
of
the
widow
s
cruise
and
the
hymn
was
meek
and
low
meek
and
low
i
shall
soon
my
jesus
know
the
last
letter
they
received
from
the
wanderers
came
on
the
first
day
of
spring
when
the
thaw
had
set
in
and
the
water
was
running
down
the
discolored
snow
on
the
mountains
like
tears
on
a
wrinkled
face
and
the
sheep
were
beginning
to
lamb
it
was
from
monte
carlo
and
was
written
by
thora
to
anna
herself
this
place
is
so
beautiful
anna
yet
i
do
not
think
i
like
it
very
much
the
houses
are
all
splendid
palaces
but
they
don
t
seem
so
comfortable
as
the
little
homes
in
iceland
i
dare
not
say
this
to
oscar
lest
he
should
think
me
ungrateful
and
certainly
there
is
no
fog
or
mist
here
and
no
big
white
waves
because
the
sea
is
always
blue
and
of
course
the
trees
are
so
wonderful
and
the
blossoms
so
beautiful
sometimes
they
have
a
carnival
and
then
of
flowers
are
flung
about
everywhere
but
next
day
it
is
quite
pitiful
to
see
the
lovely
roses
that
have
been
trampled
upon
being
swept
up
in
the
streets
in
the
afternoon
a
band
plays
in
a
garden
and
you
drive
in
a
carriage
round
and
round
it
at
night
you
go
to
a
restaurant
bigger
than
the
artisan
s
institute
and
there
another
band
plays
while
you
eat
your
dinner
two
or
three
hundred
at
once
and
all
the
ladies
in
low
dresses
after
that
you
go
to
a
casino
where
all
is
silent
and
rather
dark
and
people
sit
round
tables
and
play
cards
for
money
everybody
plays
cards
here
because
everybody
seems
to
be
always
taking
a
holiday
ah
but
the
devil
never
does
said
anna
it
is
shocking
to
hear
though
how
much
is
sometimes
lost
in
a
moment
last
night
oscar
pointed
out
a
young
man
who
had
gambled
away
the
whole
of
his
estate
larger
and
more
valuable
than
the
itself
they
say
he
had
not
intended
to
play
at
all
when
he
went
into
the
room
but
the
fever
mastered
him
and
he
could
not
resist
it
ay
ay
we
don
t
see
the
ruts
when
the
snow
covers
them
said
anna
it
made
me
feel
ill
and
i
couldn
t
stay
any
longer
but
helga
wished
to
remain
so
oscar
put
me
in
a
carriage
and
i
came
back
to
the
hotel
and
went
to
bed
i
do
wish
helga
were
not
so
fond
of
such
places
she
is
however
and
as
a
consequence
oscar
is
compelled
to
go
with
her
although
he
does
not
want
to
and
sometimes
he
comes
back
very
depressed
since
we
came
here
his
sleep
has
been
much
broken
and
his
manner
very
restless
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
leave
this
place
but
we
have
had
such
a
wonderful
time
altogether
and
oscar
has
been
so
kind
to
me
and
i
have
been
so
happy
all
the
same
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
home
again
to
see
all
the
dear
old
faces
yours
and
auntie
margret
s
and
father
s
and
the
governor
s
i
suppose
magnus
does
not
talk
of
me
now
does
he
how
is
silvertop
tell
magnus
to
rub
his
ears
for
me
and
kiss
his
rough
old
nose
what
a
romp
we
ll
have
over
the
heath
some
day
but
i
suppose
i
must
not
romp
too
much
now
must
i
it
is
so
strange
anna
there
are
hardly
any
babies
about
this
place
not
like
italy
where
you
see
them
everywhere
with
their
poor
little
legs
wrapped
up
like
a
mummy
s
we
are
to
be
back
for
the
first
of
summer
and
i
m
counting
the
days
already
give
our
love
to
everybody
and
if
anybody
asks
after
me
in
particular
say
i
am
so
well
and
so
happy
the
loom
in
the
hall
lay
idle
on
the
night
when
magnus
read
this
letter
nobody
spoke
until
anna
lit
two
candles
and
gave
one
of
them
to
magnus
saying
here
you
re
tired
and
no
wonder
being
up
before
daybreak
how
many
lambs
this
morning
magnus
but
one
of
the
best
of
them
is
dead
that
s
the
way
of
it
always
good
night
good
night
at
the
door
of
his
bedroom
magnus
paused
candle
in
hand
mother
well
do
you
think
she
is
so
very
happy
our
thora
god
knows
my
son
said
anna
the
snow
was
gone
and
the
pale
ground
was
green
and
golden
with
the
raiment
and
the
jewels
of
spring
when
the
travelers
returned
to
iceland
rounding
the
head
of
the
fiord
in
the
early
morning
when
the
little
capital
was
smoking
for
breakfast
captain
zimsen
had
fired
a
cannon
in
honor
of
their
and
everybody
ran
in
delight
thinking
the
had
come
from
copenhagen
but
there
was
greater
joy
still
when
the
laura
dropped
her
anchor
and
the
little
boats
that
had
gone
out
to
meet
her
came
back
with
the
news
that
the
wedding
party
had
returned
half
the
men
of
the
town
went
down
to
the
jetty
to
welcome
the
wanderers
among
them
the
governor
in
his
gala
uniform
the
factor
in
his
best
smoking
his
best
german
pipe
the
sheriff
the
rector
and
the
bishop
the
factor
s
big
white
boat
had
been
sent
off
instantly
to
fetch
the
three
ashore
and
when
it
was
coming
back
there
was
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
as
to
how
they
would
look
after
their
long
journey
oscar
who
was
standing
in
the
bow
was
seen
to
be
sunburnt
and
slightly
having
grown
a
small
fair
mustache
which
was
curled
up
at
the
ends
it
was
observed
by
somebody
that
he
wore
the
latest
pattern
of
waistcoat
and
carried
an
italian
cloak
over
his
arm
helga
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
looked
a
shade
more
buxom
and
wore
a
new
french
hat
she
had
a
kodak
swung
over
her
shoulder
and
was
looking
at
the
people
on
the
jetty
through
an
and
thora
who
was
sitting
in
the
stern
in
the
costume
in
which
she
went
away
with
magnus
s
white
bearskin
across
her
knees
looked
a
thought
thinner
than
before
but
her
face
was
bright
with
smiles
though
there
were
tears
in
her
sparkling
eyes
when
the
boat
came
alongside
the
salutations
were
lusty
and
robustious
such
laughter
such
chaff
such
prolonged
handshaking
and
slapping
on
the
back
after
the
governor
and
the
factor
had
kissed
thora
they
found
their
cheeks
were
wet
but
helga
was
as
bright
as
the
day
and
oscar
made
everybody
happy
he
shook
hands
all
round
and
hailed
even
the
fishermen
and
boatmen
by
name
he
doesn
t
forget
an
old
friend
eh
said
an
old
fellow
in
bare
feet
then
away
they
trooped
to
government
house
where
anna
was
waiting
in
apron
and
hufa
at
the
door
of
the
porch
thora
cried
for
joy
at
sight
of
her
and
had
to
be
carried
off
to
her
bedroom
and
when
aunt
margret
came
in
her
oiled
ringlets
and
oscar
would
have
kissed
her
she
beat
him
off
with
a
playful
pat
on
the
cheek
and
saying
i
must
see
what
you
ve
done
with
my
child
first
ran
straight
upstairs
helga
went
up
also
to
take
off
her
hat
and
the
governor
and
the
factor
carried
oscar
into
the
where
the
bishop
the
sheriff
and
the
rector
joined
them
maria
brought
in
coffee
and
chocolate
and
the
old
men
charged
their
pipes
and
plied
oscar
with
questions
the
governor
asked
about
english
politics
the
factor
about
duties
the
bishop
about
the
vatican
and
the
rector
about
the
excavations
in
the
roman
forum
oscar
answered
all
of
them
with
a
dash
and
emphasis
that
had
the
look
of
knowledge
and
the
effect
of
wit
and
then
glancing
off
the
heavy
ground
of
fact
he
went
tobogganing
down
the
slippery
slopes
of
fiction
with
amusing
tales
of
their
travels
and
of
the
ridiculous
things
that
had
and
had
not
happened
to
them
all
his
stories
told
every
time
he
pulled
the
trigger
his
pistol
fired
and
the
old
men
laughed
until
they
cried
what
a
boy
he
is
he
plays
with
every
finger
his
high
spirits
affected
them
like
sunshine
after
dark
days
like
a
breeze
after
a
calm
at
sea
like
the
swing
of
a
boat
after
the
first
dip
of
the
oar
he
was
the
same
reckless
irresponsible
lovable
prodigal
as
before
and
it
was
not
until
afterward
that
anybody
remembered
there
had
been
a
hollow
ring
in
his
hilarity
a
false
note
in
his
joy
helga
came
down
to
the
and
the
men
received
her
with
a
shout
how
plump
she
has
grown
said
the
governor
she
has
certainly
filled
out
on
the
trip
said
the
factor
hasn
t
she
said
oscar
just
what
she
wanted
all
she
wanted
nonsense
let
us
talk
of
something
serious
said
helga
thora
came
next
with
anna
and
aunt
margret
buzzing
and
humming
about
her
like
bees
she
had
changed
to
her
old
iceland
dress
just
for
remembrance
and
now
that
she
could
be
seen
without
her
veil
she
was
undoubtedly
thinner
and
she
had
a
pinched
look
about
the
nostrils
and
a
feverish
spot
in
the
middle
of
her
cheeks
but
her
face
was
shining
with
timid
smiles
and
she
was
overflowing
with
gratitude
anna
has
given
us
such
beautiful
rooms
oscar
the
big
one
overlooking
the
road
and
the
long
one
behind
it
though
i
don
t
know
what
in
the
world
we
are
going
to
do
with
two
oh
don
t
worry
yourself
about
that
dear
we
may
find
a
use
for
them
by
and
by
said
anna
with
a
knowing
nod
of
the
head
and
then
the
color
flew
up
to
thora
s
eyes
like
a
flag
of
distress
and
the
men
began
to
smile
anna
was
smiling
also
and
making
signals
to
the
governor
and
chuckling
to
him
behind
her
hand
is
it
so
yes
indeed
i
asked
her
and
it
s
just
as
i
expected
then
the
governor
in
his
turn
began
to
chuckle
and
to
whisper
to
the
factor
no
is
it
a
fact
so
anna
tells
me
and
then
they
chuckled
together
until
everybody
laughed
at
them
whereupon
the
factor
said
and
now
oscar
you
ve
told
us
all
about
london
and
paris
and
rome
but
not
a
word
about
the
place
where
they
make
money
without
working
for
it
monte
carlo
haven
t
i
said
oscar
oh
well
a
beautiful
place
in
fact
an
absolute
paradise
an
absolute
hell
if
half
one
hears
is
true
said
the
governor
well
yes
yes
that
s
so
too
said
oscar
i
once
heard
of
a
man
who
made
ten
pounds
in
a
single
night
think
of
that
said
the
factor
goodness
sake
cried
aunt
margret
but
what
s
the
good
of
having
a
chest
full
of
gold
if
the
devil
keeps
the
key
said
the
governor
then
helga
who
was
sitting
on
the
began
to
play
softly
and
oscar
swung
round
to
her
ah
addio
napoli
we
must
sing
you
some
of
the
neapolitan
songs
father
this
was
received
with
a
chorus
of
approval
and
for
the
next
helga
played
and
oscar
sang
the
gay
ditties
with
which
naples
fills
the
air
of
italy
with
song
and
when
at
one
moment
the
factor
would
have
come
back
to
the
man
who
made
ten
pounds
in
a
single
night
helga
struck
up
the
tarantella
and
oscar
danced
it
at
length
the
governor
said
everything
has
a
stopping
place
except
time
it
s
late
and
thora
is
looking
tired
so
i
m
going
to
turn
out
everybody
who
doesn
t
live
here
quite
right
too
said
aunt
margret
and
i
m
going
to
carry
helga
off
to
her
own
quarters
will
take
helga
home
said
oscar
and
with
further
handshaking
and
the
party
began
to
break
up
after
all
i
suppose
you
are
glad
to
be
back
thora
said
the
bishop
very
very
glad
replied
thora
ha
ha
it
isn
t
easy
to
hobble
a
pony
laughed
the
rector
and
you
helga
i
m
not
glad
at
all
rector
who
could
be
glad
to
leave
all
that
loveliness
for
a
wilderness
like
this
that
chilled
everybody
for
a
moment
and
thinking
to
come
to
helga
s
relief
oscar
said
there
s
something
in
what
helga
says
certainly
then
you
also
oscar
no
rector
no
that
is
to
say
well
i
m
glad
to
be
back
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
away
again
and
then
everybody
was
as
happy
as
before
next
day
oscar
and
helga
spent
many
hours
in
a
round
of
return
visits
while
thora
who
was
still
tired
stayed
at
home
and
received
some
of
her
old
schoolfellows
one
of
them
who
had
been
the
beauty
of
her
day
had
married
a
farmer
fifteen
miles
away
and
borne
him
three
children
it
was
all
work
work
work
with
her
now
and
the
girl
was
a
slave
ah
thora
how
lucky
you
were
not
to
marry
magnus
she
said
do
you
think
so
said
thora
why
yes
thora
and
then
everybody
says
oscar
is
going
to
be
such
a
distinguished
man
it
was
the
spring
caravan
time
and
magnus
himself
who
had
brought
his
wool
to
the
factor
s
came
late
in
the
afternoon
thora
thought
he
looked
brawnier
and
bigger
than
ever
and
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
his
hands
were
coarser
and
his
nails
chopped
off
square
but
his
voice
was
as
soft
as
it
used
to
be
and
he
was
shy
and
even
nervous
the
light
was
low
when
he
came
into
the
and
looking
closely
at
her
face
he
asked
three
times
over
if
she
was
well
until
she
laughed
as
she
gave
him
the
same
answer
again
and
again
then
he
laughed
too
and
after
that
they
got
on
better
and
exchanged
all
the
newses
silvertop
was
in
good
condition
he
had
got
his
summer
coat
and
looked
splendid
in
fact
he
had
been
too
well
fed
and
was
getting
a
little
over
himself
and
would
have
to
be
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
before
thora
rode
him
again
ah
well
she
wouldn
t
want
him
just
yet
not
just
yet
and
magnus
had
better
keep
the
rascal
at
the
farm
a
little
longer
but
what
a
time
you
ve
been
away
said
magnus
haven
t
we
said
thora
five
months
nearly
six
six
months
come
tuesday
week
said
magnus
at
that
they
both
became
confused
and
thora
began
to
show
some
photographs
taken
by
helga
on
the
journey
how
beautiful
how
wonderful
said
magnus
but
i
wonder
your
ship
wasn
t
floating
on
the
pumps
as
they
say
before
you
got
back
to
harbor
it
must
have
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
to
see
all
those
places
it
must
said
thora
traveling
is
so
expensive
especially
when
there
is
more
than
one
to
pay
for
and
then
there
was
helga
said
magnus
yes
indeed
there
was
helga
but
the
check
which
father
and
the
governor
gave
to
oscar
seems
to
have
been
sufficient
for
all
still
i
can
not
understand
how
he
made
it
pay
for
everything
no
it
isn
t
easy
to
understand
that
is
it
venice
rome
monte
carlo
how
you
must
have
enjoyed
your
journey
oscar
did
every
day
of
it
and
you
thora
i
m
not
a
good
traveler
i
soon
tire
of
and
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
helga
so
you
are
not
sorry
you
took
helga
with
you
thora
faltered
a
little
and
then
said
helga
was
able
to
go
with
oscar
when
i
had
to
stay
in
the
hotel
but
were
you
not
lonely
while
they
were
away
perhaps
sometimes
just
a
little
being
so
much
alone
and
among
so
many
strange
faces
magnus
who
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
the
photographs
said
almost
unconsciously
poor
little
thing
then
the
flag
of
distress
ran
up
to
thora
s
eyes
and
she
answered
hurriedly
oh
it
was
my
own
fault
oscar
always
wanted
to
stay
with
me
and
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
helga
but
a
little
catch
came
into
her
throat
and
she
had
to
stop
whereupon
magnus
said
and
i
hoped
you
were
so
happy
but
then
anna
brought
in
the
lamp
and
the
lights
relieved
the
tension
yet
being
able
to
see
the
photographs
plainly
magnus
laid
them
down
and
thora
put
them
away
he
left
early
having
a
long
ride
before
him
and
anna
followed
him
to
the
door
is
thora
quite
well
he
asked
in
a
whisper
as
well
as
can
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
said
anna
and
is
oscar
kind
to
her
kind
oscar
kind
why
should
you
ask
that
magnus
she
looks
so
pale
so
depressed
oh
that
s
often
the
way
with
young
wives
in
her
condition
haven
t
you
noticed
anything
anything
particular
our
thora
will
be
a
mother
before
long
and
is
that
all
that
s
the
matter
with
her
said
magnus
the
summer
session
of
parliament
was
to
begin
almost
immediately
and
oscar
plunged
straightway
into
preparations
for
his
campaign
he
was
to
move
a
resolution
proposing
that
the
acts
of
althing
should
henceforward
be
promulgated
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
as
in
the
old
times
from
the
ancient
mount
of
laws
at
thingvellir
it
was
to
be
his
maiden
speech
and
much
depended
upon
it
before
he
wrote
it
he
went
over
to
the
factor
s
to
discuss
with
helga
its
scheme
and
argument
after
he
had
written
it
he
went
over
to
the
factor
s
again
to
read
it
to
helga
and
obtain
the
benefit
of
her
suggestions
and
when
he
had
committed
it
to
memory
he
went
over
to
the
factor
s
a
third
time
to
rehearse
it
before
helga
it
was
helga
first
and
last
all
day
and
every
day
until
the
day
of
the
opening
sitting
helga
is
a
great
politician
but
you
care
nothing
about
politics
do
you
thora
and
thora
would
swallow
the
lump
in
her
throat
and
answer
no
thora
and
helga
were
both
present
when
oscar
took
his
seat
they
occupied
the
governor
s
that
opened
off
the
parliamentary
chamber
the
galleries
were
crowded
with
spectators
and
there
was
much
curiosity
when
oscar
rose
to
speak
thora
felt
a
little
faint
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
and
she
would
have
fled
away
if
she
could
have
done
so
but
helga
held
her
to
her
chair
hush
for
goodness
sake
be
quiet
she
whispered
you
ll
make
him
still
more
nervous
the
speech
was
a
great
success
it
was
an
appeal
for
the
preservation
of
the
old
order
for
all
that
made
iceland
what
it
was
the
land
of
saga
and
song
even
the
party
of
progress
who
thought
much
of
its
moonshine
were
carried
away
by
the
fervor
and
enthusiasm
the
poetry
and
passion
of
the
young
speaker
when
oscar
finished
there
were
vollies
of
applause
the
people
in
the
galleries
clapped
their
hands
and
helga
stood
up
and
waved
her
handkerchief
but
thora
covered
her
face
and
cried
into
her
gloves
the
resolution
was
passed
unanimously
and
oscar
was
made
chairman
of
a
committee
to
carry
out
the
necessary
preparations
this
work
occupied
all
his
spare
time
during
the
six
weeks
of
the
parliamentary
session
it
took
him
to
the
factor
s
every
day
for
helga
was
full
of
schemes
for
the
great
ceremonial
being
in
parliament
every
morning
and
at
the
factor
s
every
afternoon
oscar
was
nearly
always
from
home
and
thora
saw
little
of
him
every
night
he
returned
with
a
mouthful
of
apologies
and
a
torrent
of
explanations
they
had
been
searching
the
sagas
for
the
exact
course
taken
by
the
procession
in
the
old
days
or
they
had
been
selecting
flags
to
hang
over
the
rocks
or
they
had
been
composing
a
hymn
to
celebrate
the
occasion
oscar
had
improvised
one
in
a
moment
and
helga
had
written
it
down
and
how
has
my
little
baby
been
going
on
all
day
long
lonely
what
a
shame
i
m
sorry
very
very
sorry
he
would
say
and
then
thora
would
answer
don
t
think
of
me
oscar
you
have
your
work
to
do
and
i
only
wish
i
could
help
you
like
helga
but
in
the
long
hours
of
loneliness
when
her
head
was
on
her
hands
and
her
feet
were
in
the
fender
the
poor
little
soul
would
sink
and
the
tender
heart
grow
bitter
only
anna
would
be
with
her
then
comforting
and
consoling
her
and
pretending
to
be
blind
to
what
every
eye
could
see
anna
she
said
at
length
when
magnus
was
here
he
asked
me
such
a
strange
question
what
was
that
thora
he
asked
if
i
wasn
t
sorry
that
helga
had
gone
with
us
on
our
journey
and
are
you
sometimes
perhaps
it
is
foolish
but
sometimes
i
think
i
am
i
know
i
think
i
know
and
it
isn
t
foolish
of
you
at
all
dear
oscar
is
doing
wrong
i
must
speak
to
him
i
must
speak
to
him
severely
it
isn
t
oscar
s
fault
helga
is
so
selfish
yes
she
takes
after
somebody
else
in
that
way
thora
she
was
always
taking
oscar
away
from
me
when
we
were
on
our
journey
but
your
journey
is
over
now
and
he
must
mend
his
manners
ah
no
that
part
of
our
journey
isn
t
over
yet
anna
sometimes
i
think
it
has
only
begun
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
helga
is
trying
to
helga
has
no
pity
when
she
once
gets
hold
of
anybody
she
will
never
give
him
up
you
think
she
is
trying
to
get
hold
of
oscar
i
think
she
has
got
hold
of
him
you
mustn
t
say
that
about
your
husband
thora
oh
i
don
t
blame
oscar
helga
is
so
beautiful
so
clever
she
has
every
advantage
over
me
now
that
s
just
where
you
are
wrong
there
is
one
point
in
which
our
little
thora
has
an
advantage
over
helga
and
every
other
woman
in
the
world
you
mean
with
oscar
yes
with
oscar
you
are
going
to
be
the
mother
of
his
child
will
that
make
any
difference
any
difference
i
should
think
it
will
indeed
my
poor
mother
used
to
say
when
people
are
married
it
s
the
children
who
keep
the
pot
you
mean
that
when
my
baby
is
born
oscar
will
come
back
to
me
certainly
i
do
and
that
he
will
never
go
away
from
me
any
more
never
oscar
has
always
loved
children
wait
till
he
has
a
child
of
his
own
and
see
well
you
are
his
mother
you
know
him
best
trust
me
thora
it
isn
t
a
good
well
if
water
has
to
be
carried
to
it
but
when
the
child
is
born
oscar
will
begin
all
over
again
you
think
that
really
you
think
oscar
will
love
me
again
for
my
baby
s
sake
any
man
must
if
he
has
a
good
heart
and
oscar
s
heart
is
good
whatever
his
head
may
be
indeed
indeed
it
is
he
must
love
the
mother
for
the
sake
of
the
child
and
the
child
for
the
sake
of
the
mother
how
sweet
how
beautiful
thora
s
own
eyes
were
now
like
the
eyes
of
a
child
so
full
of
wonder
and
love
she
fell
to
counting
the
weeks
that
must
pass
before
the
fulness
of
her
time
nine
weeks
hardly
nine
eight
think
mother
only
eight
how
i
wish
it
were
even
less
i
used
to
look
forward
to
that
time
with
anxiety
and
dread
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
if
so
much
good
can
come
out
of
a
little
pain
nothing
really
now
is
there
in
this
sweet
hope
thora
comforted
herself
for
four
weeks
and
then
something
happened
which
disturbed
all
her
calculations
it
was
the
eve
of
the
proclamation
and
the
committee
of
which
oscar
was
the
chief
decided
to
visit
thingvellir
in
order
to
complete
their
preparations
for
the
ceremony
on
this
errand
helga
was
to
go
with
them
and
having
so
many
things
to
attend
to
they
were
to
sleep
one
night
at
the
and
return
the
following
day
when
oscar
announced
this
program
a
sudden
change
came
over
thora
s
patient
and
submissive
spirit
then
i
must
go
too
she
said
you
you
thora
said
oscar
why
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
miles
away
in
that
desolate
region
without
a
doctor
or
a
nurse
and
so
near
your
time
too
impossible
quite
impossible
then
helga
mustn
t
go
either
but
helga
is
so
useful
so
necessary
i
don
t
care
if
i
can
not
go
with
you
then
helga
shall
not
do
so
either
my
dear
thora
this
is
so
unlike
you
but
as
you
please
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
tell
helga
and
explain
to
the
committee
but
still
if
you
wish
it
no
no
you
must
not
cry
you
must
not
disturb
yourself
my
little
woman
must
keep
herself
very
quiet
while
i
am
away
very
very
quiet
two
hours
after
oscar
had
gone
helga
came
to
government
house
thora
was
alone
and
the
sisters
faced
each
other
for
some
instants
without
speaking
at
length
helga
said
well
i
trust
you
are
satisfied
now
that
you
have
shown
your
foolish
jealousy
and
made
us
the
talk
of
the
town
i
trust
you
are
satisfied
oscar
said
i
was
to
keep
myself
quiet
helga
and
you
know
i
ought
to
do
so
oh
you
can
excite
yourself
enough
it
seems
when
you
wish
to
express
your
paltry
feelings
because
i
have
sympathized
with
oscar
and
tried
to
help
and
inspire
him
you
who
have
never
sympathized
with
him
and
can
never
help
him
because
you
can
not
understand
him
and
he
is
beyond
you
you
must
come
with
your
paltry
spite
helga
you
have
never
been
kind
to
me
never
since
you
came
home
a
year
ago
but
now
you
are
cruel
am
i
perhaps
i
am
and
perhaps
i
ve
gone
through
enough
to
make
me
so
you
speak
as
if
your
disappointment
of
this
morning
in
not
going
with
oscar
were
a
great
and
grievous
matter
but
you
don
t
seem
to
remember
how
often
i
have
been
disappointed
in
the
same
way
oh
i
dare
say
you
think
you
are
much
to
be
pitied
i
don
t
say
i
m
to
be
pitied
helga
because
i
know
it
was
my
own
fault
at
the
beginning
but
i
do
say
i
ve
never
known
a
moment
s
peace
since
you
came
home
from
denmark
i
persuaded
father
to
send
for
you
because
you
were
my
sister
and
i
wished
you
to
share
my
happiness
but
you
have
never
shown
me
any
sisterly
feeling
never
on
the
contrary
you
found
me
happy
and
you
have
made
me
miserable
you
have
done
your
best
to
render
life
intolerable
to
me
i
thought
you
said
you
were
not
to
excite
yourself
thora
it
is
you
that
are
exciting
me
helga
because
you
are
always
inflicting
the
sharpest
tortures
upon
me
and
hurting
me
where
you
know
i
can
bear
it
least
from
the
first
you
tried
to
take
oscar
away
from
me
you
know
you
did
you
tried
to
do
it
before
our
marriage
and
you
have
tried
to
do
it
ever
since
you
were
not
even
ashamed
to
try
during
our
honeymoon
and
you
are
trying
now
because
you
have
lost
all
sense
of
loyalty
or
justice
or
remorse
or
even
shame
oh
yes
said
helga
you
think
you
have
been
a
great
martyr
but
would
it
surprise
you
to
hear
that
somebody
else
has
gone
through
a
still
greater
martyrdom
you
accuse
me
of
having
inflicted
tortures
upon
you
what
of
the
tortures
you
have
inflicted
upon
me
i
helga
yes
you
you
speak
as
if
i
were
the
sort
of
woman
who
draws
a
man
into
her
net
who
tears
him
away
from
the
wife
he
loves
and
drags
him
down
to
his
death
you
would
have
been
nearer
right
if
you
had
thought
of
me
as
another
kind
of
woman
altogether
one
who
is
herself
the
sufferer
who
is
shut
out
and
cut
off
and
must
remain
unmated
because
the
man
who
loves
her
is
married
to
somebody
else
helga
oh
i
should
have
had
mercy
on
your
condition
but
you
would
not
let
me
and
now
if
you
wish
to
hear
the
truth
i
will
tell
you
and
what
is
the
truth
helga
the
truth
is
that
oscar
does
not
love
you
at
all
perhaps
he
has
never
loved
you
helga
how
dare
you
the
falseness
of
what
you
say
is
on
the
face
of
it
if
oscar
has
never
loved
me
why
am
i
his
wife
what
advantage
had
he
to
gain
by
choosing
me
instead
of
you
what
compulsion
was
put
upon
him
if
he
did
not
love
me
why
did
he
marry
me
he
married
you
out
of
pity
from
a
mistaken
sense
of
duty
because
he
had
contracted
to
marry
you
and
thought
it
honorable
to
go
on
with
his
bargain
but
he
loved
somebody
else
and
so
he
sacrificed
both
of
them
it
s
false
helga
it
s
false
and
it
s
only
your
vanity
that
makes
you
say
so
oh
you
must
not
suppose
that
i
am
saying
this
without
a
certainty
i
had
it
from
himself
himself
he
himself
from
his
own
mouth
on
the
very
eve
of
your
marriage
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
to
me
he
told
you
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
and
since
then
if
he
has
not
said
it
in
words
he
has
said
it
in
other
ways
again
and
again
he
loves
me
still
no
no
no
it
is
not
true
he
will
always
love
me
it
is
not
true
it
is
not
true
and
he
loves
you
no
more
than
a
man
loves
his
dog
or
his
horse
or
the
man
of
the
bible
days
loved
the
handmaiden
of
his
wife
helga
for
shame
are
you
without
conscience
or
truth
that
you
can
lie
to
me
like
that
if
oscar
had
never
loved
me
do
you
think
i
should
not
have
found
it
out
long
ago
and
if
he
loved
you
do
you
think
i
should
not
know
it
i
who
am
bearing
his
child
oh
you
needn
t
taunt
me
with
that
thora
yes
yours
are
the
lips
that
kiss
him
but
it
isn
t
the
lips
that
matter
it
is
the
love
behind
the
lips
and
that
love
is
mine
and
every
time
he
kisses
you
the
kiss
is
meant
for
me
you
lie
helga
you
lie
and
the
child
too
it
is
not
your
child
because
the
love
that
gave
it
life
was
my
love
you
lie
you
lie
what
do
i
care
if
you
are
the
bondwoman
who
bears
his
child
the
child
will
be
my
child
and
when
he
is
born
he
will
have
my
face
no
it
is
not
possible
it
is
it
is
you
know
it
is
thora
gasped
for
breath
then
an
extraordinary
change
came
over
her
that
made
her
almost
unrecognizable
the
patient
and
gentle
woman
seemed
suddenly
possessed
by
a
demon
something
strange
and
horrible
seemed
in
an
instant
to
enter
into
her
soul
the
homicidal
impulse
which
takes
hold
of
wild
animals
appeared
to
assail
and
conquer
her
one
moment
she
stood
facing
her
sister
convulsed
and
livid
and
then
in
a
voice
that
was
hoarse
with
rage
and
shame
she
said
very
well
if
that
is
so
and
if
my
child
is
not
my
own
if
it
has
been
conceived
in
the
love
of
another
woman
and
i
am
only
the
bondwoman
who
bears
it
then
then
then
it
shall
never
be
born
or
if
it
is
born
i
i
i
will
kill
it
with
that
she
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
fell
on
to
the
floor
the
noise
brought
anna
into
the
room
panting
what
have
you
done
to
her
what
have
you
said
thora
thora
i
will
kill
the
child
i
will
kill
it
i
will
kill
it
the
wild
shrieking
laughter
continued
and
increased
until
the
governor
came
running
from
his
room
he
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
mad
cries
and
then
said
let
us
lift
her
up
and
carry
her
to
bed
helga
go
for
the
doctor
and
for
margret
neilsen
tell
them
to
come
quickly
she
s
in
labor
there
s
no
time
to
lose
all
night
thora
tossed
about
in
a
strong
delirium
which
expressed
itself
in
the
one
wild
homicidal
cry
aunt
margret
came
and
found
anna
in
the
the
factor
followed
and
sat
for
hours
with
the
governor
in
his
bureau
below
the
doctor
doctor
olesen
never
left
thora
s
side
he
did
not
conceal
the
gravity
of
her
condition
the
delirium
was
due
to
premature
labor
such
homicidal
mania
was
not
unknown
in
the
cases
of
young
mothers
it
generally
originated
in
some
startling
event
perhaps
a
great
loss
or
a
great
shock
or
a
grievous
disappointment
doctor
olesen
questioned
anna
but
she
knew
nothing
to
account
for
thora
s
seizure
he
asked
helga
but
she
said
little
helga
was
obviously
in
a
state
of
terror
her
face
was
deathly
pale
and
her
lips
quivered
she
could
not
be
got
to
leave
the
house
when
the
factor
returned
home
at
ten
o
clock
being
powerless
to
do
anything
he
could
not
tear
helga
away
it
was
observed
by
all
three
attendants
on
the
invalid
that
helga
did
not
ask
to
be
admitted
to
thora
s
room
a
sensible
girl
thought
the
doctor
she
knows
better
than
ask
me
thought
anna
but
helga
seemed
anxious
to
help
in
any
menial
way
no
matter
what
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
helga
sat
in
the
still
wearing
her
cloak
and
hat
and
listening
in
fear
to
the
mad
cries
from
the
chamber
overhead
in
the
long
dark
hours
she
was
a
prey
to
the
most
agonizing
thoughts
she
was
feeling
like
one
who
had
committed
a
murder
and
asking
herself
what
would
happen
if
thora
died
beyond
the
physical
agony
of
hearing
those
wild
cries
from
the
chamber
overhead
beyond
the
pangs
of
a
troubled
conscience
and
beyond
the
pain
of
the
sisterly
love
and
pity
which
overcame
her
and
surprised
her
in
these
dark
hours
helga
suffered
from
one
overmastering
terror
the
terror
of
what
oscar
would
say
to
her
when
he
came
back
he
had
been
sent
for
there
would
be
no
need
to
tell
him
anything
oscar
arrived
at
midnight
covered
with
dust
and
sweat
somebody
opened
the
hall
door
to
him
he
did
not
stop
to
look
who
it
was
but
pushing
through
the
house
came
first
upon
helga
in
the
for
a
moment
they
stood
face
to
face
like
guilty
things
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
was
breathing
heavily
how
is
she
now
he
asked
no
better
she
answered
he
heard
the
cries
from
the
room
above
is
that
she
yes
oh
god
he
muttered
and
began
to
load
himself
with
reproaches
i
should
have
taken
her
with
me
when
she
asked
me
why
didn
t
i
i
ought
to
have
known
what
would
happen
helga
had
expected
that
he
would
fly
out
at
her
and
she
could
have
borne
any
insult
but
this
she
could
not
bear
it
s
all
my
fault
he
said
i
have
been
a
fool
a
weak
selfish
fool
oh
thora
my
sweet
innocent
thora
forgive
me
forgive
me
helga
could
not
endure
the
house
any
longer
she
felt
like
a
criminal
and
wanted
to
escape
leaving
oscar
with
his
head
on
his
arms
over
the
cushions
of
the
couch
she
slipped
out
and
went
home
through
the
dark
and
silent
streets
alone
finding
helga
gone
oscar
crept
up
to
the
door
of
thora
s
room
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
enter
where
the
mere
breath
of
excitement
might
quench
the
glimmer
of
life
within
his
mother
came
out
to
him
in
the
large
room
at
the
back
and
found
him
with
his
face
down
on
the
table
she
had
intended
to
rate
him
soundly
the
moment
she
set
eyes
on
him
but
the
sight
of
his
distress
silenced
her
reproaches
and
she
fell
to
comforting
him
instead
no
no
said
anna
you
couldn
t
have
taken
her
with
you
things
are
bad
enough
as
they
are
but
think
how
much
worse
they
would
have
been
if
all
this
had
happened
there
then
i
should
have
stayed
at
home
said
oscar
i
should
have
given
up
everything
thora
couldn
t
have
wished
you
to
do
that
my
son
none
of
us
had
a
right
to
expect
it
but
you
don
t
know
everything
mother
i
have
behaved
shamefully
to
thora
i
thought
i
was
doing
right
by
her
but
i
was
doing
wrong
dreadfully
wrong
the
poor
girl
has
suffered
terribly
and
this
is
the
result
as
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
began
to
fret
the
sky
above
the
glaciers
of
the
eastern
fells
the
delirium
abated
and
there
came
a
period
of
conscious
pain
anna
ran
in
to
oscar
to
tell
him
of
the
change
and
then
on
a
similar
errand
to
where
the
governor
lay
in
his
on
the
sofa
in
his
bureau
she
s
herself
at
last
thank
the
lord
and
the
doctor
says
she
s
going
along
as
well
as
can
be
expected
two
hours
later
when
the
sun
rose
on
the
little
town
and
the
fiord
and
the
fells
were
crimson
with
his
glory
the
angel
of
peace
came
down
to
the
house
of
pain
hearing
a
babe
in
her
arms
with
a
smile
and
an
outstretched
hand
the
doctor
entered
oscar
s
room
and
said
i
am
happy
to
congratulate
you
a
girl
a
beautiful
child
but
thora
she
is
weak
but
quite
at
ease
and
as
well
as
can
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
thank
god
and
now
go
to
bed

oscar
and
sleep
if
you
can
until
this
time
i
will

will
thank
you
doctor

you
a
thousand
times
meanwhile
anna
was
in
the
bureau
telling
the
glad
news
to
the
governor
and
then
running
about
the
house
to
find
some
one
to
carry
it
to
the
factor

mother
said
a
voice
from
the
kitchen

clock

magnus

anna
god

and
the
little
mother
as
well
said
magnus
thora
slept
until
midday
under
the
combined
effects
of
exhaustion
and
a
sleeping
draught
and
when
she
awoke
the
evil
spirit
which
had
possessed
her
had
gone
and
she
was
her
own
sweet
simple
self
once
more
but
the
struggle
had
been
a
terrible
one
and
if
the
better
part
of
her
soul
had
conquered
the
frail
body
which
had
been
its
battlefield
was
a
waste
of
weakness
she
was
pale
and
thin
and
her
blue
eyes
were
large
and
liquid
before
opening
them
she
heard
from
the
back
room
which
had
been
transformed
into
a
nursery
the
sweetest
most
thrilling
sound
that
ever
comes
to
a
woman
s
ears
a
sound
which
sums
up
into
its
joys
all
the
ecstasy
that
a
human
soul
can
know
a
sound
which
no
woman
in
the
world
has
ever
heard
but
once
the
first
cry
of
her
thora
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
anna
knitting
by
her
side
is
that
baby
she
asked

nursery
and
told
aunt
margret
that
thora

awake
and
calling
impatiently
for
the
child
but

aunt
margret

said
anna
aunt
margret
gathered
up
the
baby
in
its
long
clothes
and
with
its
at
her
breast
and
carried
it
into
thora
s
room
and
stooping
by
the
bed
she
said
there

her
to
me

cried
thora
stretching

margret
there

the
free
and
daring
but
gentle
touch
that
comes
to
mothers
of
every
species
my
baby
my
baby
she
whispered
and
her
pale
face
overflowed
with
joy
yes
she
is
like
me
i
can
see
it
myself
but
why
doesn
t
she
open
her
eyes
is
she
asleep
that
can
not
be
because
she
is
still
sucking
isn
t
she
beautiful
how
foolish
of
me
to
say
that
and
yet
it
s
true
coo
my
baby
my
bootiful
bootiful
baby
through
all
this
broken
jargon
the
divine
foolishness
of
motherhood
the
two
older
women
stood
by
trying
to
cackle
and
laugh
behind
their
black
silk
aprons
but
finding
it
hard
to
keep
back
their
tears
has
oscar

we
don
t
call
that
trouble
you
ve
got
a
baby
for
it
haven
t
you
said
thora
and
she
looked
down
at
the
treasure
at
her
breast
as
if
she
had
brought
them
the
wealth
of
the
world
all
at
once
she
cried
oh
oh
look
look
aunt
margret
who
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
almost
fainted
at
thora
s
sudden
cry
what
has
happened
she
gasped
baby
has
opened
her
eyes
said
thora
aunt
margret
dropped
to
a
chair
to
breathe
they
re
blue
like
mine
oscar
s
are
brown
and
helga
s
hers
are
grey
but
perhaps
baby
s
eyes
will
change
their
color
do
children
s
eyes
change
their
color
anna
sometimes
they
do
said
anna
blue
eyes
sometimes
become
brown
never
grey
not
that
i
know
of
said
anna
i
m
so
glad
baby
is
like
me
said
thora
and
she
gazed
down
at
the
child
with
looks
of
wonder
and
love
then
her
delicious
selfishness
took
another
turn
and
she
said
mother
do
you
not
think
oscar
has
slept
long
enough
now
doctor
olesen
said
he
was
to
sleep
until
replied
anna
but
couldn
t
you
wake
him
up
for
a
moment
just
for
a
moment
to
come
and
see
us
as
we
are
now
baby
and
me
would
it
do
him
much
harm
no
but
it
would
do
you
a
great
deal
you
would
yourself
and
then
my
gracious
i
should
get
into
trouble
oh
no
i
shall
be
quite
calm
i
promise
you
i
shall
be
calm
and
oscar
can
come
in
his
and
then
go
back
to
sleep
do
call
him
do
please
do
anna
aunt
margret
mother
they
could
not
resist
the
pleading
voice
and
anna
went
off
to
oscar
s
room
oscar
was
awake
how
is
she
now
he
asked
still
a
little
weak
but
getting
stronger
every
hour
said
anna
and
the
child
she
s
got
it
in
bed
with
her
and
wishes
you
to
come
and
see
them
i
ll
come
at
once
dear
thora
she
is
happy
at
last
i
have
never
seen
anybody
so
happy
and
nobody
ever
deserved
happiness
more
just
now
when
i
left
her
she
had
the
eyes
of
a
child
but
she
is
still
on
the
brink
of
life
and
death
it
wouldn
t
need
much
to
make
her
take
flight
from
this
world
therefore
watch
over
your
words
oscar
and
don
t
say
anything
that
will
agitate
her
oscar
promised
and
then
followed
his
mother
into
thora
s
bedroom
at
the
threshold
he
heard
the
soft
of
motherly
endearment
and
then
saw
the
shining
pale
face
on
the
pillow
with
the
tiny
red
one
below
it
my
poor
thora
he
said
kissing
her
forehead
you
are
not
suffering
now
are
you
a
little
pale
perhaps
and
a
little
thin
but
better
are
you
not
look
she
whispered
uncovering
the
child
and
having
no
thoughts
to
waste
on
lesser
matters
who
is
she
like
oscar
like
do
you
ask
me
who
she
s
like
thora
why
she
s
like
ridiculously
like
you
kiss
me
oscar
put
your
arms
around
both
of
us
dearest
that
way
so
but
at
the
next
moment
the
baby
was
crying
and
the
older
women
were
protesting
loudly
come
away
you
great
clumsy
creature
said
aunt
margret
no
no
cried
thora
it
wasn
t
oscar
he
never
hurts
anybody
it
was
i
auntie
but
auntie
making
no
terms
with
such
heroics
took
the
child
out
of
bed
and
proceeded
to
rock
it
face
downward
across
her
knee
when
the
baby
had
been
hushed
to
sleep
they
fell
to
the
discussion
of
its
name
oscar
was
for
thora
but
thora
herself
said
no
that
was
her
own
name
the
name
oscar
knew
her
by
and
therefore
she
could
not
share
it
even
with
her
child
then
what
do
you
say
to
elin
said
oscar
beautiful
anna
aunt
margret
listen
say
it
again
oscar
isn
t
it
lovely
as
oscar
says
it
so
they
decided
straightway
that
elin
it
should
be
and
next
came
the
question
of
the
godparents
thora
was
for
magnus
poor
magnus
and
oscar
assented
but
when
oscar
in
his
turn
nominated
helga
the
sunshine
died
off
thora
s
face
whereupon
anna
gave
him
a
quick
glance
and
began
to
make
a
noise
then
magnus
for
godfather
and
aunt
margret
for
godmother
said
oscar
and
so
it
was
agreed
and
let
us
have
the
baptism
said
thora
cried
anna
why
thora
a
child
is
never
baptised
on
the
day
of
its
birth
except
when
it
is
going
to
die
it
was
now
aunt
margret
s
turn
to
make
a
noise
and
this
she
did
by
wakening
baby
in
rising
suddenly
and
protesting
that
oscar
ought
to
be
turned
out
of
the
room
and
thora
left
to
rest
yes
yes
that
s
true
said
oscar
and
kissing
thora
again
he
followed
aunt
margret
and
the
baby
into
the
nursery
when
they
were
gone
and
the
door
had
closed
on
them
anna
leaned
over
the
bed
and
whispered
there
didn
t
i
know
what
o
clock
it
was
striking
hasn
t
oscar
come
back
to
you
when
he
kissed
you
didn
t
you
feel
that
all
his
heart
was
yours
yes
it
is
true
said
thora
but
will
it
last
think
you
certainly
it
will
last
last
night
he
was
reproaching
himself
with
all
sorts
of
things
and
he
is
like
a
man
who
is
beginning
over
again
a
new
life
you
think
so
anna
you
really
think
so
indeed
i
do
depend
upon
it
he
ll
not
lose
sight
of
that
baby
for
five
minutes
in
the
day
and
he
ll
never
look
at
her
but
he
ll
think
of
you
how
happy
i
am
i
have
never
been
so
happy
before
never
never
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
closed
her
shining
eyes
to
ease
the
beating
of
her
heart
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
in
another
voice
she
said
mother
yes
dear
last
night
when
i
was
so
ill
didn
t
i
say
hush
that
s
all
over
we
ll
not
speak
of
it
any
more
all
the
same
if
i
could
die
now
now
when
i
am
so
happy
and
baby
too
and
then
anna
sank
into
a
chair
trembling
from
head
to
foot
anna
was
right
about
oscar
and
the
baby
he
could
not
willingly
allow
it
to
be
out
of
his
sight
for
any
five
minutes
of
the
day
or
night
when
it
was
to
be
bathed
he
felt
it
necessary
to
superintend
the
operation
and
when
it
was
fed
he
was
compelled
to
keep
watch
and
ward
he
had
a
thousand
fears
of
accidents
that
might
happen
to
it
and
became
dizzy
when
it
lay
naked
on
the
edge
of
aunt
margret
s
lap
if
it
cried
while
he
was
in
the
he
rushed
upstairs
and
if
anything
fell
on
the
floor
above
he
turned
pale
and
trembled
sleeping
in
the
room
next
to
the
nursery
he
kept
his
door
open
at
night
and
if
the
baby
was
fretful
he
walked
aunt
margret
to
and
fro
being
afraid
to
carry
the
child
himself
as
if
she
had
taken
too
much
laudanum
two
days
passed
in
this
way
and
he
was
never
once
thora
overheard
him
in
the
adjoining
room
coaxing
and
scolding
aunt
margret
and
talking
or
laughing
to
the
child
and
her
heart
overflowed
with
happiness
but
will
it
last
she
asked
herself
meantime
helga
sitting
at
home
shut
out
from
these
joys
was
feeling
herself
neglected
on
the
third
day
oscar
had
a
message
from
her
saying
she
wished
to
see
him
on
an
important
matter
and
asking
him
to
come
round
immediately
he
could
not
resist
it
the
little
scented
envelope
drew
him
like
a
magnet
going
out
for
a
walk
to
think
of
what
he
should
do
every
step
took
him
in
the
direction
of
the
factor
s
within
half
an
hour
he
found
himself
in
the
little
overlooking
the
lake
and
helga
was
standing
before
him
with
head
down
more
meek
and
modest
but
also
more
beautiful
and
irresistible
than
ever
before
i
have
a
confession
to
make
to
you
she
said
and
if
you
are
angry
with
me
i
must
bear
it
she
had
been
the
cause
of
poor
thora
s
sudden
illness
stung
by
the
disappointment
of
some
days
ago
she
had
gone
across
to
government
house
to
reproach
her
sister
with
the
humiliation
she
had
put
upon
her
perhaps
she
had
said
too
much
and
more
than
was
true
and
she
was
sorry
and
ashamed
she
could
wish
to
ask
thora
s
forgiveness
and
if
oscar
would
do
it
for
her
with
pleasure
helga
said
oscar
but
all
s
well
that
ends
well
and
why
should
we
say
more
on
this
subject
there
is
another
that
i
wished
to
speak
of
said
helga
and
then
came
the
real
burden
of
her
message
poor
thora
s
delirium
had
been
homicidal
she
had
threatened
to
take
the
life
of
her
unborn
child
what
a
frightful
thing
it
would
be
if
out
of
her
weakness
and
hallucination
she
should
attempt
to
carry
out
her
threat
but
that
s
all
over
now
helga
said
oscar
since
her
baby
came
thora
had
been
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
running
over
with
tenderness
and
love
so
i
thought
until
this
morning
said
helga
but
father
tells
me
that
your
mother
sees
signs
of
dementia
still
good
heavens
cried
oscar
everybody
appears
to
have
heard
of
it
except
you
i
thought
it
was
wrong
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
and
so
i
ve
told
you
thanks
helga
it
is
good
of
you
and
if
poor
thora
is
still
suffering
in
that
way
there
can
t
be
a
doubt
of
it
oscar
she
told
your
mother
she
wished
she
could
die
and
baby
with
her
she
must
be
watched
the
child
too
there
must
be
nurses
night
and
day
is
that
enough
oscar
you
know
how
cunning
people
are
when
they
are
suffering
from
dementia
and
then
a
child
is
such
a
frail
thing
its
life
might
be
snuffed
out
in
an
instant
you
mean
that
baby
should
be
removed
it
might
be
safest
for
a
time
at
least
it
might
come
here
i
should
take
the
greatest
care
of
it
but
it
needn
t
change
its
nurse
aunt
margret
must
come
home
soon
in
any
case
it
must
be
done
helga
it
would
be
too
awful
if
anything
happened
to
the
child
i
should
go
mad
and
then
think
of
thora
it
would
be
ten
thousand
times
more
terrible
for
her
poor
thora
it
will
break
her
heart
said
oscar
it
seems
as
if
i
am
doomed
to
bring
grief
and
pain
and
death
to
her
we
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind
oscar
but
don
t
act
on
my
advice
only
and
for
mercy
s
sake
don
t
say
i
suggested
anything
ask
somebody
else
i
will
ask
the
governor
the
governor
at
the
mention
of
that
name
they
paused
and
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
as
if
a
ghost
had
passed
between
them
any
news
from
monte
car
i
mean
copenhagen
asked
helga
nothing
yet
but
i
am
in
daily
fear
of
something
happening
whatever
happens
i
shall
never
forget
that
you
did
that
for
me
oscar
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
took
it
kept
it
for
a
moment
then
kissed
it
passionately
and
fled
from
the
house
later
the
same
day
a
family
conference
was
held
at
government
house
to
consider
what
ought
to
be
done
the
governor
and
the
factor
were
there
as
well
as
oscar
and
anna
aunt
margret
came
down
last
having
left
one
of
the
maids
in
charge
of
the
child
magnus
is
in
the
nursery
too
she
said
he
came
up
with
wood
for
the
stove
and
thora
heard
his
voice
so
now
they
are
talking
through
the
open
door
doctor
olesen
had
been
called
into
consultation
and
he
gave
a
guarded
opinion
such
forms
of
homicidal
mania
were
due
to
weakness
and
were
usually
transient
since
the
night
of
the
confinement
he
had
seen
no
signs
of
it
himself
but
if
anna
had
seen
them
he
would
not
take
the
responsibility
of
opposing
the
step
that
was
suggested
anna
rocked
herself
and
moaned
and
said
that
after
all
she
could
not
be
certain
she
might
have
mistaken
what
had
fallen
from
thora
perhaps
the
poor
child
had
been
thinking
of
something
quite
different
aunt
margret
was
now
of
the
same
mind
but
much
more
emphatic
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
she
said
and
i
m
sorry
i
ever
doubted
her
thora
is
a
neilsen
and
she
wouldn
t
hurt
a
hair
of
the
child
s
head
this
is
no
time
to
indulge
sentimental
feelings
said
the
governor
if
thora
is
suffering
from
dementia
however
transient
we
must
protect
her
from
the
dangers
of
her
weakness
i
agree
stephen
said
the
factor
i
m
sorry
i
m
sorry
for
my
daughter
but
i
agree
i
agree
that
is
our
duty
our
plain
duty
continued
the
governor
first
to
the
child
who
is
the
offspring
at
present
the
only
probable
offspring
of
two
families
and
next
to
the
poor
young
mother
herself
than
whom
no
one
would
have
more
right
to
reproach
us
if
we
failed
to
do
it
and
a
disaster
occurred
no
one
stephen
no
one
said
the
factor
it
seems
so
cruel
so
dreadfully
cruel
said
anna
but
it
s
all
for
thora
s
own
good
mother
said
oscar
i
know
oscar
i
know
yet
it
s
cruel
for
all
that
but
i
should
like
to
know
who
s
going
to
do
it
said
aunt
margret
i
m
not
i
tell
you
flat
then
anna
must
do
it
herself
said
the
governor
no
no
don
t
ask
me
said
anna
why
not
who
so
proper
to
do
such
an
act
of
mercy
and
love
and
oscar
too
oscar
himself
if
need
be
must
carry
the
child
over
to
the
factor
s
oscar
s
lips
whitened
and
quivered
and
his
heart
clutched
at
his
ribs
it
was
decided
that
the
child
should
be
taken
from
the
mother
that
night
as
soon
as
she
was
asleep
and
the
house
was
quiet
but
she
goes
to
sleep
with
the
child
at
her
breast
and
always
awakes
when
it
wants
the
bottle
said
anna
i
ll
give
her
a
draught
she
ll
sleep
until
morning
said
the
doctor
oh
dear
me
oh
dear
me
i
shall
feel
like
a
thief
said
anna
or
like
a
murderer
said
aunt
margret
meantime
magnus
in
the
nursery
was
looking
down
at
the
little
face
in
the
cot
sometimes
blinking
at
the
light
sometimes
digging
its
little
fist
into
its
face
sometimes
gripping
with
its
tiny
soft
hand
his
own
coarse
finger
through
the
open
door
to
the
adjoining
room
there
came
the
voice
that
he
knew
so
well
a
little
weaker
a
little
thinner
but
more
joyous
and
silvery
than
before
is
that
you
magnus
yes
thora
have
you
seen
my
little
elin
i
m
looking
at
her
now
thora
isn
t
she
beautiful
isn
t
she
a
darling
she
s
like
a
little
angel
thora
a
joyous
thrill
came
from
the
other
room
and
then
the
silvery
voice
began
again
she
s
awake
isn
t
she
can
t
i
hear
her
laughing
she
laughs
already
the
little
rogue
do
you
know
you
are
to
be
her
godfather
magnus
i
am
yes
oscar
agreed
to
it
immediately
and
the
baptism
is
to
take
place
soon
it
will
be
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
thora
oh
she
ll
give
you
lots
of
trouble
she
s
going
to
be
such
a
little
mischief
can
t
you
see
her
growing
up
magnus
i
see
her
just
like
her
mother
when
she
was
a
child
thora
another
joyous
trill
came
through
the
open
door
and
then
the
silvery
voice
once
more
she
ll
be
going
to
stay
with
you
at
the
farm
some
day
and
then
she
ll
pull
up
all
the
flowers
in
your
garden
she
shall
do
whatever
she
likes
thora
but
there
are
chasms
and
caves
and
rifts
in
the
earth
there
aren
t
there
i
ll
keep
watch
on
her
thora
if
she
should
slip
anywhere
i
ll
keep
watch
on
her
all
her
life
thora
the
joyous
trill
came
again
but
with
a
slightly
different
note
then
magnus
yes
thora
why
don
t
you
marry
and
have
a
little
elin
of
your
own
you
know
i
oh
no
and
then
a
gruff
laugh
and
something
about
a
poor
farmer
don
t
say
that
magnus
then
the
silvery
voice
that
came
to
him
through
the
open
door
became
serious
and
sweetly
patronizing
hoping
he
would
be
happy
and
prosperous
at
thingvellir
it
wasn
t
a
great
life
certainly
not
a
distinguished
career
like
oscar
s
that
is
to
say
what
oscar
was
to
be
and
it
wanted
hard
work
early
and
late
yet
still
but
magnus
you
ve
been
here
three
days
haven
t
you
how
have
you
been
able
to
spare
them
i
ll
make
up
for
them
when
i
get
home
thora
but
anna
says
you
haven
t
been
to
bed
since
you
came
and
now
the
proclamation
is
near
and
you
ll
be
kept
busy
at
the
inn
with
that
i
m
strong
thora
fearfully
strong
said
magnus
thora
lay
back
in
her
bed
and
with
a
blush
there
was
none
to
see
said
magnus
i
think
i
really
think
you
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
me
a
gruff
laugh
came
back
to
her
half
smothered
as
in
a
man
s
beard
and
then
a
choking
voice
said
i
believe
i
would
thora
and
if
i
wanted
you
or
baby
wanted
you
i
think
you
would
follow
us
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
only
say
come
and
i
ll
come
thora
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
a
merry
laugh
came
rippling
out
to
him
and
he
felt
hot
to
the
roots
of
the
hair
but
of
course
that
can
not
happen
magnus
we
have
oscar
so
we
can
never
need
you
no
you
can
never
need
me
thora
at
that
moment
anna
and
aunt
margret
came
back
heated
and
nervous
after
the
conference
and
bundled
magnus
out
of
the
room
then
while
baby
was
being
bathed
for
bed
behind
closed
doors
to
the
customary
chorus
of
screams
anna
combed
out
thora
s
hair
for
the
night
and
thora
talked
of
magnus
people
think
him
heavy
and
stupid
but
he
ll
startle
them
some
day
she
said
is
it
to
be
plaited
as
usual
asked
anna
just
as
usual
but
how
your
hands
tremble
mother
that
s
nursing
you
know
poor
magnus
he
hasn
t
a
selfish
thought
in
his
heart
any
girl
might
love
him
and
perhaps
if
i
had
never
known
oscar
doctor
olesen
says
you
are
to
take
a
powder
child
it
will
make
you
sleep
until
morning
it
s
you
that
should
take
the
powder
you
and
aunt
margret
ah

i
could
take
it
for
you
i
would
dear
said
anna
but
here
it
is
take
it
quickly
or
i
may
thora
drank
from
the
glass
anna
gave
her
and
said
there
it
s
gone
now
bring
me
baby
aunt
margret
came
with
the
child
hushing
it
to
sleep
and
put
it
gently
down
into
the
mother
s
arms
the
darling
she
needs
no
sleeping
draught
my
precious
precious
pet
but
i
declare
aunt
margret
s
hands
are
trembling
too
i
ve
worn
you
out
both
of
you
nonsense
go
to
sleep
i
m
going
to
put
down
the
light
said
aunt
margret
and
she
lowered
the
lamp
and
put
it
to
stand
on
a
table
behind
the
how
good
you
are
to
me
everybody
is
good
to
me
came
in
a
fainter
voice
from
the
shadow
of
the
bed
that
is
because
everybody
loves
you
thora
said
anna
in
a
husky
murmur
you
must
always
believe
that
whatever
happens
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
loved
if
i
could
only
think
that
it
would
last
the
baby
became
fretful
and
thora
began
to
sing
it
to
sleep
sleep
baby
sleep
angels
bright
thy
slumbers
keep
sleep
baby
sleep
her
drowsy
voice
ran
a
line
and
stopped
then
ran
another
line
and
stopped
again
and
then
the
faint
voice
said
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
fall
asleep
like
this
some
day
baby
and
i
and
awake
in
heaven
hush
i
should
be
sorry
for
oscar
but
still
the
faint
voice
lisped
the
soft
breathing
lengthened
the
blue
eyelids
closed
the
pale
lips
parted
the
white
arms
slackened
and
then
the
two
children
mother
and
babe
lay
together
in
the
lap
of
sleep
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
wherein
the
two
older
women
who
sat
in
the
gloom
like
guilty
things
heard
nothing
but
the
ticking
of
a
clock
then
aunt
margret
crept
over
to
where
anna
sat
with
her
head
covered
by
her
black
silk
apron
and
whispered
oscar
is
waiting
at
the
door
if
it
has
to
be
done
at
all
let
it
be
done
now
anna
uncovered
her
face
and
saw
oscar
on
the
threshold
in
his
cloak
and
hat
she
rose
on
trembling
limbs
and
felt
her
way
to
the
bedside
there
she
stood
listening
for
a
moment
to
thora
s
measured
breathing
then
she
drew
the
mother
s
white
arms
apart
and
lifted
the
baby
out
of
them
aunt
margret
wrapped
a
shawl
about
the
sleeping
child
and
oscar
covered
it
with
his
cloak
the
night
is
warm
she
will
take
no
harm
he
faltered
at
the
next
moment
he
had
gone
and
aunt
margret
had
followed
him
then
anna
tottered
into
the
outer
room
and
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
head
again
oh
god
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
she
said
the
sun
was
shining
into
the
bedroom
when
thora
awoke
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
pale
cheeks
and
a
look
of
happiness
in
her
eyes
and
saw
anna
rocking
herself
sadly
by
the
bedside
where
is
baby
asked
thora

anna
continued
to
rock
herself
and
to
moan
oh

dear
thora
watched
her
for
a
moment
with
eyes
that
filled
with
fear
and
then
called
in
a
shrill
voice

thora
struggled
to
raise
herself
in

but
her
cheeks
whitened
and
her
eyes
rolled
and
with
a
loud
scream
she
fell
back
fainting
the
maids
came
running
into
the
bedroom
and
opened
thora
s
clinched
hands
while
anna
bathed
her
forehead
what

moment
and
looked
about

with
dazed
eyes
oscar
she
said
i

to
see
oscar
and
so
you

said
anna
and
she
sent
one
of
the
maids
across
to
the
factor
s
to
fetch
him
instantly
oscar
came
four
steps
at
a
stride
and
entered
the
room
like
a
rush
of
wind
my
poor
thora
he
said
with
panting
breath
and
he
leaned
over
the
bed
to
kiss
her
thora
s
eyes
which
had
been
dry
and
hard
now
melted
and
grew
wet
oscar
she
said

mother

little
elin

baby
cried
thora
i
must
have
her
back
i
have
her
back
in
thora
s
flashing
eyes
which
changed
the
character
of
her
countenance
and
in
her
voice
which
was
husky
with
rage
and
hatred
there
was
something
of
the
fierce
animal
which
has
been
robbed
of
its
young
oscar
shuddered
at
sight
of
the
convulsed
and
livid
face
but
he
answered
quietly
thora
if
you
give
way
to
feelings
like
those
you
will
make
yourself
ill
again
and
then
baby
will
never
come
back
to
you
if
you
will
only
listen
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
were
very
bad
before
baby
came
and
doctor
feared
you
might
even
do
some
harm
to
her
therefore
to
save
you
from
pain
and
shame
i
took
her
away
from
you
for
a
little
while
only
for
a
little
while
until
you
were
better
and
more
sure
of
yourself
thora
then
a
great
silence
fell
on
thora
s
bewailing
and
she
said
in
a
husky
whisper
so
it
was
you
oscar
well
yes
dear
it
was
i
but
what
i
did
was
for
your
own
good
yours
and
our
little
elin
s
and
if
you
will
only
wait
only
be
patient
your
baby
shall
be
brought
back
to
you
and
we
shall
be
happy
thora
s
wet
eyes
dried
of
themselves
but
it
was
a
glassy
and
smileless
light
that
came
into
them
where
is
my
baby
now
she
asked
not
far
away
in
fact
only
at
your
father
s
aunt
margret
wrapped
her
in
a
shawl
and
i
took
her
across
myself
then
you
gave
my
child
to
helga
said
thora
well
yes
i
gave
her
to
helga
but
aunt
margret
is
there
now
and
besides
i
intend
to
go
over
myself
off
and
on
all
day
long
so
you
are
not
to
worry
or
be
anxious
about
anything
not
about
any
single
thing
you
understand
everything
now
dear
do
you
not
yes
i
understand
everything
now
said
thora
the
glassy
smileless
eyes
continued
to
look
up
at
him
but
he
mistook
the
light
that
shone
in
them
that
s
a
dear
good
girl
he
said
everybody
will
be
delighted
to
hear
you
are
so
reasonable
and
resigned
because
everybody
thought
you
would
be
inconsolable
everybody
except
helga
helga
helga
said
you
would
be
yourself
within
an
hour
and
she
was
right
helga
knew
you
better
than
any
of
us
yes
helga
knew
me
better
than
any
of
you
said
thora
then
he
sat
on
the
end
of
the
bed
and
chatted
gaily
on
many
subjects
while
anna
crying
for
joy
of
the
change
in
thora
s
spirits
called
for
her
breakfast
and
coaxed
her
to
swallow
some
of
it
he
talked
of
his
work
of
the
work
he
was
going
to
do
when
he
began
which
would
be
soon
very
soon
now
then
of
his
ambitions
in
parliament
and
finally
of
the
proclamation
it
was
fixed
for
the
day
after
everybody
was
going
to
it
and
the
town
would
be
empty
as
for
himself
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
at
home
with
thora
but
seeing
that
the
celebration
at
thingvellir
had
been
his
idea
and
that
he
had
taken
such
a
prominent
part
in
it
people
were
saying
that
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
he
could
not
be
present
then
there
s
the
hymn
you
know
said
oscar
i
ve
been
rehearsing
the
choir
and
they
are
very
shaky
but
if
i
thought
the
organist
could
hold
them
together
i
shouldn
t
go
in
any
case
what
does
helga
say
asked
thora
helga
oh
helga
helga
says
i
must
go
replied
oscar
so
do
i
said
thora
you
do
really
what
a
sweet
unselfish
soul
it
is
to
be
sure
said
oscar
and
kissing
thora
on
the
forehead
he
ran
back
to
see
elin
the
glassy
smileless
eyes
on
the
pillow
followed
him
out
of
the
room
but
their
light
was
the
light
of
despair
going
out
of
government
house
oscar
came
upon
magnus
who
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
in
hand
and
with
golden
mane
at
the
door
of
the
porch
by
the
dark
cloud
on
magnus
s
face
oscar
could
see
that
his
brother
was
in
a
sullen
and
rebellious
mood
and
to
avoid
further
hostilities
he
saluted
him
and
tried
to
run
on
wait
said
magnus
another
time
said
oscar
now
said
magnus
and
laying
his
big
hand
on
oscar
s
arm
he
drew
him
back
into
the
hall
oscar
flushed
up
at
the
indignity
and
said
sharply
well
what
is
it
oscar
said
magnus
i
heard
what
passed
in
the
bedroom
then
you
were
listening
i
was
you
are
not
ashamed
to
say
you
were
listening
on
the
stairs
on
your
hands
and
knees
perhaps
to
my
conversation
with
my
wife
i
would
have
listened
on
my
belly
if
need
be
said
magnus
and
his
face
darkened
more
and
more
may
i
ask
why
you
listened
said
oscar
because
i
could
not
do
otherwise
how
so
i
had
given
my
word
to
be
here
when
wanted
to
my
wife
yes
you
will
excuse
my
saying
magnus
that
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
attended
to
your
own
business
this
is
my
own
business
oscar
you
must
give
the
child
back
to
thora
really
magnus
you
are
taking
a
most
unwarrantable
liberty
if
you
were
not
my
brother
shah
give
the
mother
her
child
good
lord
man
said
oscar
breathing
hard
as
if
he
had
been
running
do
you
really
think
that
i
am
going
to
allow
an
outsider
even
if
he
is
my
brother
to
dictate
to
me
what
i
shall
do
with
my
family
difficulties
and
to
travel
all
the
way
from
thingvellir
to
conduct
my
domestic
affairs
what
right
have
you
to
mix
yourself
in
my
business
the
business
of
my
wife
and
me
the
cloud
that
contracted
magnus
s
face
grew
darker
every
moment
and
he
said
you
ask
me
what
right
i
do
i
loved
thora
neilsen
you
think
it
necessary
to
tell
me
that
said
oscar
to
remind
me
that
she
threw
you
up
for
me
that
s
a
lie
oscar
stephenson
strong
said
oscar
with
a
laugh
but
he
was
trembling
visibly
i
gave
her
up
when
i
could
have
kept
her
to
her
word
i
decided
in
favor
of
the
girl
s
happiness
against
my
own
i
gave
her
up
to
you
that
you
might
make
her
happy
those
were
the
terms
on
which
i
gave
her
up
to
you
and
what
is
the
result
what
is
the
result
i
ask
you
you
have
allowed
another
woman
to
take
her
place
another
woman
said
oscar
is
that
the
way
you
talk
of
her
own
sister
of
helga
sister
or
not
she
has
tortured
thora
by
every
art
her
selfish
soul
could
think
of
said
magnus
that
s
what
she
has
done
and
you
have
helped
her
and
the
treasure
i
valued
more
than
my
life
you
have
flung
away
oscar
made
a
cry
of
protest
but
magnus
bore
him
down
with
a
torrent
of
words
such
as
never
came
from
his
silent
lips
before
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
what
kind
of
life
you
led
that
poor
unhappy
child
while
you
were
away
you
and
the
girl
together
and
now
that
her
baby
comes
and
her
husband
returns
to
her
as
he
must
if
he
is
a
man
you
let
her
sister
s
scheming
heart
rob
her
of
her
only
happiness
again
oscar
with
his
whitening
lips
did
his
best
to
laugh
magnus
he
said
it
is
impossible
to
be
angry
with
you
apparently
you
do
not
know
that
it
was
with
the
consent
of
the
family
and
by
the
advice
of
the
doctor
that
the
child
was
taken
from
its
mother
bah
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
who
suggested
it
do
you
think
that
i
don
t
see
her
object
do
you
think
i
don
t
hear
her
pitiful
pleas
the
same
as
if
i
had
listened
to
them
the
little
innocent
is
in
danger
of
its
life
it
must
come
to
her
she
must
take
charge
of
it
why
to
bring
you
back
to
her
feet
to
attach
you
to
her
at
any
cost
and
you
like
a
fool
fall
into
her
plans
because
you
want
to
because
you
don
t
know
yourself
or
your
wife
or
the
woman
that
isn
t
worthy
to
tie
her
shoes
oscar
winced
under
magnus
s
words
for
they
cut
him
to
the
bone
oscar
said
magnus
again
you
will
give
the
child
back
to
the
mother
it
will
be
best
i
promise
you
i
have
my
own
opinion
of
what
is
best
said
oscar
bridling
and
if
i
think
that
for
the
time
being
mother
and
child
are
best
apart
oscar
stephenson
interrupted
magnus
you
will
give
the
child
back
to
the
mother
and
if
i
refuse
by
what
right
will
you
command
me
said
oscar
by
the
right
i
acquired
when
i
gave
thora
up
to
you
replied
magnus
and
by
the
right
i
acquired
when
she
became
my
wife
i
will
do
with
her
child
as
i
think
proper
said
oscar
at
that
magnus
lost
all
control
of
himself
is
she
a
dog
that
you
can
take
her
whelps
he
cried
the
law
gives
me
the
right
to
dispose
of
her
offspring
as
i
think
proper
said
oscar
then
damn
the
law
cried
magnus
and
if
you
are
deaf
to
my
entreaties
i
i
will
go
on
said
oscar
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
you
have
threatened
to
break
the
law
you
are
breaking
that
poor
girl
s
heart
yet
you
talk
to
me
about
breaking
the
law
but
i
ll
do
more
than
that
if
you
will
not
give
the
child
to
its
mother
i
will
take
it
by
force
and
give
it
back
to
her
myself
and
if
any
man
tries
to
prevent
me
no
matter
who
he
is
or
what
he
is
by
god
i
ll
break
his
teeth
down
his
throat
flinging
down
his
magnus
had
taken
a
step
forward
and
lifted
his
clinched
fist
into
oscar
s
quivering
face
when
a
cry
came
from
the
head
of
the
staircase
magnus
oscar
magnus
magnus
it
was
anna
she
ran
down
and
put
herself
between
the
two
men
the
slight
lithe
figure
and
fair
head
of
oscar
and
the
burly
form
and
swarthy
face
of
magnus
both
panting
hard
and
livid
with
rage
and
hate
my
sons
my
sons
for
shame
for
shame
she
cried
every
word
could
be
heard
in
the
bedroom
and
thora
is
crying
her
eyes
out
magnus
dropped
his
arm
and
fell
aside
a
pace
or
two
rebuked
and
ashamed
but
oscar
stood
with
an
unflinching
front
where
his
mother
had
found
him
magnus
oscar
continued
anna
if
you
both
love
the
poor
girl
who
is
lying
helpless
isn
t
that
a
reason
why
you
should
be
friends
and
not
enemies
and
then
think
of
me
my
sons
i
am
your
mother
surely
the
sons
of
one
mother
can
live
at
peace
i
nursed
you
both
when
you
were
little
ones
and
if
there
should
be
strife
between
you
now
and
blows
and
perhaps
bloodshed
it
would
kill
me
i
could
never
survive
it
then
she
turned
toward
magnus
and
said
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
tears
that
choked
her
magnus
you
mustn
t
be
angry
with
oscar
he
is
your
younger
brother
remember
you
and
he
slept
in
the
same
bed
when
you
were
children
and
when
he
was
a
boy
you
used
to
carry
him
on
your
back
and
fight
all
his
battles
magnus
groaned
and
turned
again
until
he
stood
sideways
to
his
mother
and
thinking
he
was
not
to
be
moved
she
faced
about
to
oscar
oscar
she
said
you
must
make
peace
with
magnus
you
must
if
only
for
thora
s
sake
remember
you
have
got
her
oscar
and
if
it
is
true
that
magnus
gave
her
up
to
you
although
he
loved
her
himself
think
of
the
sacrifice
he
must
have
made
for
both
of
you
perhaps
he
loves
her
still
and
has
condemned
himself
to
loneliness
because
he
has
lost
her
and
perhaps
he
weeps
his
heart
out
for
her
the
long
nights
through
love
that
suffers
like
that
has
a
great
excuse
oscar
doesn
t
it
give
him
a
right
to
look
to
thora
s
happiness
and
if
he
thinks
she
is
suffering
for
want
of
her
little
elin
oscar
s
throat
was
hurting
him
and
in
a
husky
voice
he
said
she
shall
have
the
child
back
mother
if
the
doctor
says
it
is
safe
she
shall
have
the
child
back
immediately
there
said
anna
that
s
fair
nothing
could
be
fairer
than
that
magnus
come
now
you
must
shake
hands
with
oscar
she
put
her
hand
on
magnus
s
arm
but
he
did
not
move
magnus
she
said
your
mother
s
love
may
be
all
that
is
left
to
you
now
but
it
will
last
long
my
son
you
need
not
give
it
up
to
any
one
and
no
one
can
take
it
away
after
all
a
mother
s
love
is
best
it
will
cling
to
you
and
comfort
you
whatever
you
do
and
whatever
the
world
may
do
to
you
magnus
you
must
make
friends
with
your
brother
for
your
mother
s
sake
magnus
magnus
turned
about
and
saw
oscar
before
him
with
broken
face
and
outstretched
hand
then
his
own
hand
swung
out
drew
back
swung
out
again
and
at
the
next
moment
the
big
burly
fellow
had
flung
his
arms
about
oscar
s
neck
and
was
sobbing
over
him
like
a
child
two
minutes
later
magnus
was
on
his
way
home
cracking
his
long
whip
over
golden
mane
s
flying
head
and
whooping
and
galloping
like
a
madman
some
we
loved
the
loveliest
and
the
from
his
vintage
rolling
time
hath
prest
drunk
their
cup
a
round
or
two
before
one
by
one
crept
silently
to
the
day
of
the
proclamation
of
the
laws
was
to
be
kept
as
a
general
holiday
a
hundred
pack
horses
carrying
tents
and
provisions
had
left
the
little
capital
for
thingvellir
the
day
before
the
danish
anchored
in
the
fiord
had
lent
half
its
flags
and
the
order
of
good
templars
had
sent
all
their
insignia
it
was
to
be
a
great
and
gorgeous
spectacle
before
daybreak
the
town
was
astir
and
elderly
people
on
slow
ponies
were
setting
out
on
their
journey
everybody
was
on
horseback
for
the
way
was
long
and
iceland
had
few
roads
and
no
coaches
soon
after
dawn
the
governor
started
off
in
his
cocked
hat
and
with
his
inverness
belted
over
the
bright
gold
of
his
official
uniform
factor
neilsen
rode
beside
him
and
the
bishop
the
chief
justice
and
most
of
the
thingmen
followed
in
his
train
the
idea
of
reviving
a
great
ceremony
of
ancient
days
and
clasping
hands
with
the
mighty
dead
over
a
gulf
of
a
thousand
years
had
taken
hold
of
everybody
s
imagination
oscar
stephenson
who
had
been
the
first
to
think
of
it
was
among
the
last
to
go
he
had
been
round
to
the
factor
s
house
to
see
the
child
and
to
fetch
helga
the
sun
was
reddening
the
sky
over
the
eastern
hills
when
they
mounted
their
fleet
young
ponies
it
was
a
quiet
morning
with
the
promise
of
a
radiant
day
helga
wore
her
woolen
helmet
and
a
fur
cape
over
a
white
jersey
oscar
was
in
riding
dress
with
his
new
italian
cloak
hung
loose
from
his
shoulders
their
way
out
of
the
town
lay
past
the
end
of
government
house
under
the
windows
of
thora
s
bedroom
and
oscar
stopped
and
called
up
to
it
helloa
helloa
cried
oscar
is
it
worth
while
to
waken
her
said
helga
but
the
window
opened
and
anna
s
face
appeared
at
it
it
s
oscar
she
said
facing
back
into
the
room
thora
we
ll
be
back
this
evening
there
was
an
indistinct
murmur
from
within
and
then
anna
said
thora
says
and
you
are
not
to
hurry
home
on
her
account
oscar
laughed
and
answered
we
ll
see
we
ll
see
and
then
the
riders
put
their
heels
to
their
ponies
and
bounded
away
helga
was
in
high
spirits
but
the
clouds
hung
on
oscar
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
banish
them
all
goes
well
doesn
t
it
asked
helga
god
knows
said
oscar
she
s
quiet
certainly
and
apparently
resigned
yet
her
eyes
are
so
dry
her
lips
so
pale
and
her
cheeks
so
white
and
thin
but
what
else
can
you
expect
four
days
after
her
confinement
said
helga
true
but
i
ve
never
seen
her
quite
like
this
before
it
is
almost
as
if
a
wall
of
ice
had
frozen
about
her
soul
you
took
my
advice
didn
t
you
i
did
and
what
did
the
governor
say
he
said
magnus
s
interference
was
an
impertinence
and
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
for
a
moment
so
things
are
to
remain
as
they
are
as
they
are
said
oscar
and
what
about
magnus
himself
asked
helga
magnus
is
at
the
farm
but
if
he
should
come
back
while
everybody
is
away
he
can
not
come
back
his
guests
will
keep
him
busy
but
if
he
should
in
spite
of
everything
in
that
case
said
oscar
dropping
his
voice
and
turning
his
head
the
sheriff
has
orders
to
deal
with
him
by
this
time
they
had
come
to
the
tail
of
the
train
which
had
started
before
them
and
the
dust
and
the
noise
of
the
clattering
caravan
were
too
much
for
helga
let
us
go
round
by
the
hot
springs
and
come
out
ahead
of
them
she
said
and
they
went
cantering
down
a
lane
to
the
left
where
vapor
floated
over
a
flowing
stream
half
an
hour
later
they
returned
to
the
main
road
forded
a
river
and
toited
up
a
hill
beyond
it
the
cavalcade
was
now
far
behind
them
and
the
little
wooden
capital
was
a
long
way
off
with
its
feet
in
the
grey
fiord
and
the
white
encircling
arms
of
the
hills
stretching
out
to
the
brightening
line
of
the
sea
and
sky
there
said
helga
drawing
rein
and
looking
at
oscar
with
a
sparkle
in
her
eyes
poor
little
thora
i
was
sorry
to
leave
her
but
i
dare
say
everything
will
be
well
said
oscar
sure
to
be
said
helga
is
that
a
steamer
out
there
out
by
the
head
asked
oscar
undoubtedly
it
is
a
steamer
replied
helga
the
laura
is
a
day
late
she
was
due
to
arrive
yesterday
then
it
s
the
laura
to
a
certainty
the
sun
had
now
risen
but
oscar
shivered
as
with
cold
i
must
be
a
miserable
coward
helga
for
the
sight
of
a
frightens
me
he
said
but
helga
only
laughed
and
held
up
a
warning
hand
we
ll
not
talk
of
that
oscar
not
at
all
events
look
she
cried
pointing
to
the
line
of
moving
forms
on
the
brown
streak
of
road
that
ran
through
the
plain
of
black
lava
look
at
your
tribe
down
yonder
don
t
you
feel
like
mahomet
going
back
to
mecca
or
like
jacob
going
up
to
the
mount
of
gilead
with
his
flocks
and
his
herds
and
and
his
wives
said
oscar
yes
and
his
wives
laughed
helga
and
then
both
laughed
together
they
put
heels
to
their
ponies
again
and
helga
sang
to
herself
as
they
swung
along
what
a
fool
i
am
thought
oscar
why
should
i
meet
misfortune
before
it
comes
and
why
should
i
trouble
so
much
about
thora
isn
t
helga
as
greatly
to
be
pitied
in
the
wretched
tangle
of
our
fate
hers
is
the
knot
that
can
never
be
untied
yet
how
happy
she
looks
why
shouldn
t
i
be
happy
helga
said
oscar
when
they
slowed
down
again
you
wouldn
t
like
to
have
lived
in
those
old
days
i
suppose
certainly
i
should
said
helga
what
and
share
your
husband
with
another
woman
that
s
nothing
women
do
the
same
in
these
days
you
know
and
then
they
laughed
again
though
with
a
dubious
gaiety
and
broke
into
a
canter
once
more
i
m
a
brute
thought
oscar
and
badly
as
i
have
injured
thora
the
wrong
i
have
done
to
helga
is
still
more
terrible
for
her
there
is
no
outlook
no
prospect
no
future
she
must
go
back
to
denmark
and
i
must
go
on
with
my
duty
but
why
shouldn
t
we
have
one
day
of
happiness
first
one
day
of
delight
before
the
dream
is
over
they
drew
up
at
a
river
that
ran
by
the
road
to
water
their
ponies
and
to
take
off
their
cloaks
and
pack
them
behind
their
saddles
for
the
sun
was
now
bright
and
the
air
was
warm
there
s
one
curious
point
about
the
patriarchs
said
oscar
and
what
s
that
asked
helga
clearly
they
thought
it
possible
for
a
man
to
love
more
than
one
woman
and
can
t
he
said
helga
i
ask
you
said
oscar
can
t
a
man
love
more
than
one
woman
why
not
aren
t
we
all
told
to
love
one
another
laughed
helga
and
then
oscar
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
swung
her
back
to
her
saddle
and
they
started
on
their
journey
afresh
their
road
lay
through
a
bleak
and
barren
country
past
red
hills
of
volcanic
sand
and
jagged
mouths
of
extinct
volcanoes
over
a
deep
dale
of
lava
rocks
rutted
with
paths
and
scored
with
fissures
but
brightened
by
a
farmstead
here
and
there
with
its
little
elt
house
smoking
for
breakfast
and
its
hummocked
gleaming
like
a
gem
in
a
wilderness
of
waste
at
the
last
of
these
farms
they
stopped
to
rest
their
ponies
and
to
refresh
themselves
being
now
to
thingvellir
with
the
caravan
far
behind
them
an
untidy
man
in
his
took
possession
of
their
ponies
and
a
slatternly
housewife
in
a
soiled
apron
brought
them
milk
and
skyr
she
was
still
young
but
already
she
had
three
children
one
of
them
was
whimpering
at
her
breast
another
was
dragging
at
her
skirts
and
the
third
was
bellowing
for
her
from
the
floor
above
she
belonged
to
the
capital
and
had
once
been
considered
a
beauty
but
she
was
seven
years
married
and
it
was
six
since
she
had
seen
the
town
there
said
oscar
when
they
returned
to
the
road
that
s
the
patriarchal
life
if
you
please
then
i
m
done
with
it
said
helga
ugh
to
think
of
being
buried
in
a
place
like
that
year
in
year
out
with
three
children
and
only
one
man
it
might
do
for
thora
but
give
me
life
life
life
and
the
man
who
gives
you
that
may
have
you
body
and
soul
perhaps
said
oscar
body
and
soul
laughed
helga
for
the
next
hour
their
course
lay
across
an
almost
trackless
heath
bare
as
a
desert
and
flat
as
an
inland
sea
the
mountains
that
bounded
it
were
stark
and
cold
and
far
away
on
the
one
side
steep
with
running
screes
and
on
the
other
side
clouded
with
steaming
vapor
which
rose
out
of
the
glistening
snow
not
a
house
was
to
be
seen
on
any
side
not
a
tree
or
a
bush
or
a
flower
or
a
plant
and
hardly
a
blade
of
grass
but
only
a
broad
stretch
of
silver
moss
leaden
and
dull
like
the
mold
on
a
dead
man
s
face
no
birds
sang
in
that
solitude
but
sometimes
the
wimbrel
sent
its
long
love
cry
across
the
waste
sometimes
the
wild
swan
sped
far
overhead
and
uttered
its
eerie
ululation
and
sometimes
the
raven
perched
on
a
stone
and
croaked
out
its
melancholy
note
a
line
of
beacons
broken
and
old
each
with
a
projecting
stone
like
an
amputated
arm
showed
the
course
of
the
road
going
on
and
on
like
soldiers
in
single
file
tramping
back
after
a
lost
battle
midway
on
the
heath
there
was
a
house
of
rest
for
travelers
overtaken
by
the
storms
of
winter
a
little
hut
half
cubicle
and
half
stable
with
nothing
but
a
plank
bed
and
a
truss
of
hay
gracious
heavens
what
a
place
to
be
lost
in
in
a
snowstorm
said
helga
but
what
a
country
for
saga
and
song
said
oscar
and
if
some
one
could
set
it
to
music
grim
as
its
glaciers
and
fierce
as
its
fires
it
would
take
the
world
by
storm
do
it
oscar
do
it
and
i
ll
love
you
cried
helga
as
we
are
commanded
to
love
one
another
asked
oscar
perhaps
laughed
helga
and
when
he
swung
her
to
the
saddle
again
her
hand
slipped
from
his
shoulder
and
his
lips
touched
her
cheek
after
that
they
both
sang
as
they
cantered
along
for
the
clouds
that
had
hung
over
oscar
had
gone
by
this
time
and
if
the
ground
was
grey
the
sky
was
blue
and
their
blood
was
red
and
warm
but
suddenly
a
new
scene
opened
at
their
feet
a
deep
plain
with
a
shining
blue
lake
in
the
midst
of
it
splashed
with
islands
like
spots
on
an
eagle
s
egg
and
fenced
by
soft
green
fells
it
was
a
dream
in
a
desolate
land
a
cistern
of
sunshine
encircled
by
countless
peaks
which
stood
round
it
clothed
in
white
like
a
surpliced
choir
that
were
singing
their
hymns
to
god
the
black
lava
was
there
as
elsewhere
and
the
valley
was
blistered
with
mounds
and
wrinkled
with
ruts
and
scored
with
fissures
but
the
grew
in
the
clefts
of
the
jagged
rocks
and
the
blueberry
hung
over
the
face
of
the
gaping
chasms
and
it
was
almost
as
if
an
angel
had
passed
over
the
surface
torn
by
earthquakes
and
brushed
it
with
the
bloom
of
his
wings
this
was
thingvellir
the
place
of
the
proclamation
the
of
the
northlands
the
scene
of
a
hundred
sagas
the
subject
of
a
thousand
songs
oscar
and
helga
were
now
near
the
end
of
their
journey
and
they
watched
for
the
townspeople
to
overtake
them
half
an
hour
later
the
caravan
came
up
in
a
cloud
of
dust
all
noisy
but
and
ravenous
for
breakfast
there
were
some
shouts
at
the
pioneers
and
certain
dubious
compliments
but
oscar
did
not
hear
and
helga
did
not
heed
they
took
their
places
behind
the
governor
and
went
down
to
the
in
his
train
the
way
to
it
was
through
a
wide
chasm
whose
parallel
walls
stood
up
on
either
side
of
the
steep
causeway
like
the
ruined
street
of
some
prehistoric
city
but
thrice
grander
and
more
awesome
than
any
work
of
the
hand
of
man
because
straight
from
the
loins
of
nature
and
rent
from
the
womb
of
the
earth
there
were
great
openings
as
of
arches
empty
spaces
as
of
windows
broken
peaks
as
of
pediments
and
curious
stones
as
of
carvings
all
shaken
from
their
foundations
and
toppling
as
if
to
fall
while
over
them
from
beetling
side
to
side
hung
the
gay
flags
of
the
danish
and
through
them
came
the
bright
shafts
of
the
morning
sun
down
the
gorge
there
was
a
mound
like
a
platform
the
explained
oscar
to
helga
and
at
the
foot
of
it
there
was
a
pool
whose
clear
green
depths
looked
cold
and
chill
in
the
palm
of
the
cliffs
that
darkened
it
that
s
the
drowning
pool
said
oscar
when
a
woman
was
unfaithful
to
her
husband
they
hurled
her
from
the
rocks
into
the
water
and
what
did
they
do
with
the
unfaithful
men
laughed
helga
from
the
edge
of
the
pool
a
frothy
river
fell
with
a
thunderous
clamor
over
a
precipice
to
the
valley
below
where
it
forked
into
many
fingers
and
ran
off
to
the
margin
of
the
lake
beyond
these
rivulets
there
was
the
rutted
plain
now
dotted
over
with
tents
but
having
only
two
houses
within
sight
the
little
wooden
parsonage
with
its
tiny
church
built
of
stone
and
shingles
and
the
of
magnus
stephenson
magnus
himself
stood
waiting
there
washed
and
dressed
after
working
the
whole
night
through
with
his
man
john
vidalin
to
prepare
for
his
expected
guests
and
when
oscar
rode
up
a
little
excited
and
confused
he
received
him
with
the
cheerful
face
of
one
who
had
made
his
peace
with
his
brother
and
meant
to
keep
it
how
s
thora
asked
magnus
as
he
loosened
the
girths
of
oscar
s
saddle
and
oscar
answered
nervously
better
that
is
to
say
well
perhaps
not
so
very
well
magnus
her
child
has
been
given
back
to
her
said
magnus
not
yet
said
oscar
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
governor
and
then
he
faltered
out
the
sequel
to
his
broken
promise
magnus
s
face
darkened
and
he
said
so
the
doctor
has
not
been
consulted
at
all
no
in
the
teeth
of
the
governor
s
orders
it
was
plainly
impossible
and
thora
is
still
at
government
house
and
her
child
is
still
at
the
factor
s
that
is
so
magnus
looked
from
oscar
to
helga
who
now
stood
beside
him
and
his
face
darkened
more
and
more
john
vidalin
he
cried
in
a
thick
voice
over
his
shoulder
to
a
man
behind
him
saddle
my
horse
i
am
going
to
reykjavik
but
magnus
said
the
with
all
this
work
to
do
and
all
this
money
coming
saddle
it
quick
cried
magnus
like
a
man
who
was
choking
magnus
said
oscar
for
your
own
sake
i
think
it
only
right
to
tell
you
but
magnus
cut
him
short
by
turning
on
his
heel
let
him
go
said
helga
and
before
the
people
in
the
tents
and
the
had
settled
down
to
breakfast
magnus
was
riding
back
to
town
meantime
thora
at
home
was
in
the
throes
of
a
great
temptation
she
had
heard
the
between
magnus
and
her
husband
and
had
said
to
herself
oscar
will
go
to
see
olesen
at
once
and
the
dear
doctor
will
say
certainly
the
little
mother
is
quite
well
enough
now
to
take
care
of
her
baby
give
the
child
back
to
her
then
oscar
would
come
rushing
and
her
room
would
be
the
same
as
if
a
window
had
blown
open
and
he
would
cry
doctor
says
baby
may
come
back
and
then
anna
would
take
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turn
him
out
and
everybody
would
laugh
but
oscar
was
long
in
coming
and
when
he
came
he
said
nothing
about
the
doctor
he
only
talked
about
their
little
elin
and
said
he
had
just
returned
from
seeing
her
she
was
so
rosy
and
well
and
she
was
beginning
to
notice
if
you
held
out
your
finger
she
looked
at
it
as
if
it
were
the
bough
of
a
great
tree
and
then
held
it
tight
as
if
her
little
body
hung
by
it
i
couldn
t
tear
myself
away
from
her
thora
he
said
it
s
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
pleasure
you
can
get
out
of
a
baby
it
was
strange
that
oscar
did
not
see
that
he
was
hurting
her
every
minute
but
she
only
thought
i
know
what
it
is
he
is
going
to
take
me
by
surprise
he
doesn
t
want
to
tell
me
that
baby
is
coming
until
she
comes
he
will
bring
her
back
as
he
took
her
away
in
the
night
while
i
am
asleep
and
when
i
awake
in
the
morning
she
will
be
there
in
this
sweet
hope
thora
closed
her
eyes
early
that
evening
before
the
red
glow
of
the
sunset
had
quite
gone
from
the
walls
of
her
room
saying
a
little
prayer
for
oscar
and
another
little
prayer
for
elin
that
she
might
be
as
lovely
as
ever
when
she
saw
her
in
the
morning
and
then
she
fell
asleep
when
she
awoke
next
day
she
listened
for
the
baby
s
breathing
and
thinking
she
heard
it
she
stretched
out
a
gentle
hand
to
the
place
where
the
child
should
lie
and
then
with
a
smile
she
opened
her
eyes
but
her
baby
was
not
there
and
the
sun
in
the
room
died
out
when
the
doctor
came
to
see
her
that
morning
he
looked
grave
and
anxious
i
m
afraid
my
little
patient
is
worrying
overmuch
he
said
the
head
is
hot
and
there
is
some
fever
she
must
lie
quiet
perfectly
quiet
for
the
next
few
days
or
i
won
t
answer
for
what
may
happen
only
this
not
a
word
about
baby
and
even
when
the
doctor
took
anna
into
the
nursery
to
give
the
usual
instructions
thora
listened
intently
but
there
was
not
a
syllable
about
the
child
the
governor
came
next
with
the
odor
of
snuff
on
his
coat
and
he
stroked
thora
s
arm
as
it
lay
on
the
counterpane
and
said
she
was
not
to
worry
about
anything
my
dear
little
daughter
must
get
better
as
fast
as
ever
she
can
he
said
she
must
eat
more
and
if
she
wants
anything
she
must
ask
for
it
and
she
shall
have
it
whatever
it
is
she
tried
to
say
that
all
she
wanted
was
her
little
baby
and
if
they
would
give
her
that
she
would
soon
be
well
but
her
throat
was
hurting
and
she
could
not
speak
her
own
father
came
last
smelling
of
breakfast
and
strong
tobacco
and
he
rallied
her
in
a
loud
voice
tut
tut
this
will
never
do
we
ll
have
to
send
you
away
again
with
helga
to
look
after
you
and
look
here
young
lady
you
ve
got
to
get
better
soon
and
come
and
carry
away
that
baby
she
s
turning
our
house
upside
down
nobody
over
there
can
see
the
sun
for
that
little
mite
and
aunt
margret
and
auntie
helga
haven
t
a
thought
for
anybody
else
by
this
time
the
conviction
had
forced
itself
upon
thora
s
mind
that
the
family
had
agreed
that
the
child
was
not
to
be
returned
to
her
and
that
helga
was
responsible
for
this
cruel
resolution
then
a
fierce
passion
took
possession
of
her
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
she
hated
her
sister
with
a
terrible
hatred
helga
who
had
first
robbed
her
of
her
husband
had
now
robbed
her
of
her
child
and
throwing
dust
in
her
people
s
eyes
had
used
her
weakness
as
an
excuse
and
a
blind
but
she
would
defeat
her
she
would
defeat
everybody
she
would
get
back
her
child
whatever
the
consequences
and
not
all
the
powers
of
earth
or
heaven
or
hell
should
take
it
away
from
her
again
the
intensity
of
her
feeling
if
it
could
have
been
realized
by
those
about
her
would
have
made
her
sweet
and
gentle
soul
unrecognizable
she
was
like
a
feline
animal
robbed
of
its
young
and
going
out
to
recover
it
all
the
other
passions
and
emotions
that
had
ever
possessed
her
love
of
her
husband
affection
for
anna
and
aunt
margret
and
her
father
and
the
governor
pity
for
magnus
and
tenderness
toward
all
living
things
were
burnt
up
by
the
one
consuming
desire
the
desire
for
her
child
it
made
her
terrible
it
made
her
cruel
it
made
her
cunning
thora
determined
to
steal
back
her
own
child
the
following
day
the
day
of
the
proclamation
would
give
her
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
nearly
everybody
would
then
be
at
thingvellir
therefore
her
path
would
be
more
clear
only
anna
would
stay
at
home
to
attend
to
herself
and
aunt
margret
to
attend
to
the
child
her
one
feverish
anxiety
was
that
oscar
should
not
stay
behind
as
well
for
if
oscar
were
to
remain
helga
would
remain
also
and
then
her
scheme
would
come
to
naught
thora
lay
awake
the
whole
night
through
before
daybreak
she
heard
the
people
shouting
in
the
darkness
at
dawn
she
heard
the
departure
of
the
governor
and
when
oscar
called
up
at
her
window
she
knew
that
helga
was
with
him
for
she
heard
the
hoofs
of
two
horses
when
everybody
had
gone
she
lay
back
on
her
pillow
with
a
sigh
of
immense
relief
how
soon
will
they
be
back
mother
she
asked
not
much
before
midnight
i
m
afraid
but
you
must
not
fret
after
anybody
my
child
for
everything
shall
be
done
for
you
said
anna
then
the
transparent
young
soul
in
the
fierce
fire
of
its
temptation
began
to
lay
plans
for
deceiving
anna
and
for
getting
her
out
of
the
way
at
one
moment
she
said
haven
t
you
any
errands
to
do
this
morning
dear
in
the
town
i
mean
being
left
alone
you
know
and
even
the
servants
gone
errands
bless
your
dear
heart
it
s
like
sunday
in
town
and
not
a
shop
open
anywhere
said
anna
at
another
moment
thora
said
mother
if
you
wish
to
go
down
into
the
kitchen
to
cook
you
needn
t
think
of
me
the
cooking
is
all
done
dear
said
anna
maria
did
it
yesterday
and
i
ve
nothing
to
do
now
but
warm
up
the
dishes
on
the
nursery
stove
so
i
needn
t
leave
you
for
a
minute
you
see
thora
was
beginning
to
be
restless
in
her
perplexity
but
presently
she
thought
i
know
i
ll
tell
her
to
lie
down
after
dinner
and
then
i
ll
get
up
and
dress
and
go
that
suggested
thoughts
about
her
clothes
which
had
been
taken
off
on
the
night
of
her
attack
and
packed
away
somewhere
there
would
be
drawers
to
open
and
search
and
that
would
take
time
and
make
noises
so
she
said
mother
dear
don
t
you
think
my
clothes
must
be
getting
damp
lying
so
long
unused
damp
in
five
days
and
the
middle
of
summer
too
cried
anna
still
it
would
be
nice
to
see
them
airing
it
would
make
me
think
of
getting
up
you
know
then
you
shall
sweetheart
certainly
you
shall
said
anna
and
with
the
playfulness
of
one
who
indulges
a
child
the
good
soul
took
thora
s
clothes
out
of
a
wardrobe
held
them
up
to
her
one
by
one
and
then
hung
them
on
the
chairs
in
front
of
the
stove
in
the
nursery
clucking
and
crowing
of
the
day
when
thora
would
put
them
on
and
go
with
wraps
and
scarves
and
oscar
helping
her
thora
watched
intently
and
then
said
i
haven
t
seen
my
cloak
yet
mother
your
cloak
your
outdoor
cloak
bless
me
what
a
heart
she
has
to
be
sure
but
no
no
we
ll
all
be
dancing
with
delight
if
you
need
that
for
the
next
three
weeks
thora
the
hours
lagged
cruelly
before
dinner
and
after
it
the
sun
s
line
on
the
wall
was
long
in
leaving
the
bed
but
at
last
three
o
clock
struck
on
the
bornholme
clock
below
stairs
and
then
thora
said
mother
i
m
sure
you
are
very
tired
i
wish
you
would
go
to
your
room
and

said
anna
but
i

and

m
sure

said
thora
well
seeing
you
slept
so
little
last

anna
and
thora
began
to
yawn
and
sigh
i
ll
leave
both
doors
open
then
and
see
thora
i
ll
put
this
little
handbell
on
the
table
and
if

and

like
a
cat

the
least
noise

me
good
night
mother
said
thora
in
a
drowsy
tone
and
anna
smiling
and
nodding
to
herself
over
thora
s
error
stole
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
thora
listened
for
the
last
footfall
in
the
corridor
and
then
raised
herself
in
bed
she
was
alone
at
last
and
the
time
had
come
to
defeat
the
conspiracy
of
love
and
kindness
prompted
by
jealousy
and
envy
that
had
robbed
her
of
her
child
her
child
her
child
she
must
get
back
her
child
whatever
it
might
cost
her
she
dropped
to
the
floor
and
in
doing
so
she
brushed
the
off
the
table
it
fell
to
the
carpet
with
a
deadened
clang
and
for
a
moment
she
held
her
breath
and
listened
but
there
was
no
sound
from
anna
s
room
so
she
clutched
at
the
bedclothes
and
stood
erect
then
the
walls
went
round
and
she
knew
for
the
first
time
how
weak
she
was
but
her
heart
was
strong
if
her
limbs
were
feeble
and
she
found
her
way
to
the
nursery
where
her
clothes
still
hung
over
the
backs
of
chairs
it
was
a
weary
task
to
put
them
on
but
her
purpose
never
flagged
at
last
she
was
dressed
and
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
her
eyes
were
red
her
lips
were
pale
and
her
cheeks
were
sucked
in
and
white
nobody
would
know
her
who
met
her
in
the
street
yet
still
if
she
could
find
her
cloak
the
bornholme
clock
chimed
half
past
three
and
thora
began
to
steal
down
the
corridor
she
had
to
go
by
anna
s
bedroom
and
the
door
was
standing
open
anna
s
shawl
lay
on
a
chair
within
and
she
snatched
it
up
and
wrapped
it
over
her
shoulders
and
her
head
then
she
went
her
limbs
trembled
under
her
but
not
from
fear
and
if
anybody
had
tried
to
stop
her
now
she
would
have
fought
like
a
fiend
my
child
is
mine
she
thought
what
right
have
they
to
keep
her
from
me
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
street
the
bornholme
clock
struck
four
anna
awoke
and
hearing
no
sound
from
thora
s
room
she
went
back
to
the
nursery
and
busied
herself
noiselessly
at
the
stove
presently
the
lace
curtains
in
the
bedroom
were
rustled
by
the
wind
from
an
open
window
and
anna
cried
through
the
door
lie
quiet
thora
i
m
making
tea
and
then
she
began
to
sing
to
herself
in
the
voice
of
her
youth
a
few
minutes
later
she
said
that
sleep
must
have
made
me
stupid
i
ve
actually
put
in
the
hot
water
before
the
soon
afterwards
she
sailed
into
thora
s
room
with
the
tea
tray
in
both
hands
and
a
smile
on
her
face
saying
here
it
is
but
you
ll
thank
your
stars
when
maria
comes
back
in
the
morning
she
was
setting
down
the
tray
on
the
round
table
by
the
bedside
where
the
should
have
been
when
her
eyes
fell
on
the
empty
bed
her
breath
jumped
in
her
throat
and
she
turned
her
head
slowly
over
her
shoulder
calling
thora
there
was
no
answer
the
room
was
empty
anna
remembered
the
clothes
which
she
had
laid
out
on
the
chairs
in
the
nursery
they
were
gone
thora
thora
she
cried
in
an
agitated
whisper
then
the
smile
came
back
to
her
face
i
know
she
thought
thora
has
dressed
herself
and
gone
down
to
the
just
to
show
me
what
she
can
do
at
that
thought
the
smile
was
chased
away
by
a
mighty
frown
but
i
ll
give
it
her
she
thought
and
downstairs
she
went
with
a
determined
step
and
banged
the
door
back
saying
really
thora
it
is
very
naughty
but
the
protest
died
in
her
throat
for
thora
was
not
there
then
her
heart
shook
like
a
leaf
stiffened
by
hoar
frost
and
she
ran
through
the
house
from
room
to
room
crying
in
a
voice
shrill
with
fear
and
thickened
by
sobs
thora
where
are
you
thora
honey
don
t
hide
yourself
from
me
thora
thora
at
that
moment
golden
mane
came
tolting
up
to
the
green
and
magnus
entered
the
house
hearing
his
mother
s
voice
he
ran
and
came
face
to
face
with
anna
in
the
corridor
what
has
happened
he
asked
thora
s
lost
said
anna
lost
she
coaxed
me
to
lie
down
this
afternoon
and
while
i
was
asleep
she
got
up
and
dressed
herself
and
she
is
gone
let
us
be
sure
first
said
magnus
and
the
slow
fellow
shot
through
the
house
like
a
torpedo
while
anna
sat
on
the
chair
by
the
door
of
her
own
room
and
wrung
her
hands
and
reproached
herself
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
have
i
done
how
can
i
ever
forgive
myself
the
poor
child
was
not
herself
she
didn
t
know
what
she
was
doing
magnus
returned
with
a
slow
step
saying
be
quiet
mother
can
t
you
see
what
has
happened
thora
has
gone
to
the
child
the
child
the
factor
s
god
grant
you
may
be
right
magnus
but
she
hasn
t
mentioned
the
baby
for
two
days
nevertheless
said
magnus
her
poor
heart
has
been
torn
to
pieces
by
this
accursed
scheme
of
separating
her
from
her
child
and
she
has
gone
to
join
it
let
us
go
and
see
said
anna
but
oh
dear
what
a
thing
to
do
and
she
so
ill
and
weak
it
will
kill
her
oh
why
did
i
leave
her
for
an
instant
what
will
oscar
say
if
oscar
s
wise
he
will
say
nothing
said
magnus
and
if
anything
happens
and
he
has
any
conscience
he
ll
damn
himself
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
don
t
say
that
magnus
said
anna
if
there
was
anything
wrong
we
were
all
to
blame
for
it
it
wasn
t
oscar
s
fault
certainly
it
was
oscar
s
fault
said
magnus
it
was
oscar
s
fault
that
he
allowed
helga
to
twist
him
round
her
finger
and
make
you
all
her
miserable
slaves
where
is
my
shawl
i
laid
it
down
somewhere
and
now
i
can
not
find
it
but
let
us
go
and
don
t
be
hard
on
your
mother
magnus
she
was
trying
to
do
her
best
it
s
not
you
i
m
blaming
mother
said
magnus
but
if
he
added
and
his
words
came
through
his
clinched
teeth
if
there
were
a
law
in
this
infernal
land
to
punish
people
like
oscar
as
sure
as
i
live
i
should
be
the
first
to
use
it
they
were
going
out
of
the
house
when
three
men
came
up
to
the
door
the
sheriff
and
two
strangers
good
evening
anna
said
the
sheriff
these
gentlemen
are
officials
from
copenhagen
just
arrived
by
the
they
wish
to
see
the
governor
on
an
important
matter
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
tell
them
when
he
will
be
back
from
thingvellir
i
can
t
say
i
don
t
know
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
said
anna
this
young
man
said
the
sheriff
to
the
strangers
is
the
elder
son
of
the
governor
and
if
you
would
like
to
speak
to
him
we
should
answered
the
men
is
it
so
very
important
my
son
is
going
out
with
me
can
t
the
matter
wait
until
said
anna
go
on
ahead
mother
i
ll
follow
you
presently
said
magnus
and
while
anna
hurried
away
he
led
the
strangers
into
the
governor
s
office
one
of
the
two
men
took
a
paper
from
an
inner
breast
pocket
and
said
naturally
you
know
your
father
s
handwriting
i
do
said
magnus
and
of
course
you
are
familiar
with
his
signature
i
am
will
you
be
good
enough
to
say
if
this
is
your
father
s
signature
said
the
man
opening
his
paper
and
handing
it
to
magnus
it
was
a
note
of
hand
in
favor
of
oscar
stephenson
for
an
advance
of
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
signed
in
the
name
of
the
governor
and
witnessed
by
the
factor
the
world
reeled
round
magnus
for
he
saw
in
a
moment
what
the
paper
meant
it
was
almost
as
if
his
prayer
to
punish
oscar
had
been
answered
on
the
instant
the
paper
rustled
in
his
hand
and
for
some
seconds
he
did
not
speak
then
he
lifted
his
face
and
said
you
ask
me
if
this
is
my
father
s
signature
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
more
proper
to
ask
my
father
himself
no
doubt
certainly
you
are
right
said
the
stranger
but
to
protect
your
father
not
to
say
yourself
perhaps
perhaps
said
magnus
and
he
handed
the
paper
back
magnus
said
the
sheriff
i
was
told
to
watch
you
if
you
came
to
town
but
it
seems
to
me
that
somebody
else
in
your
family
needs
watching
a
good
deal
more
will
you
not
give
us
your
assistance
magnus
shuddered
in
the
toils
of
his
temptation
a
voice
within
cried
speak
denounce
him
now
s
your
time
his
lower
lip
quivered
his
eyelids
trembled
and
he
answered
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
governor
will
not
be
back
until
midnight
let
me
come
to
you
morning
good
said
the
sheriff
whereupon
magnus
showed
them
out
of
the
house
and
then
fled
away
to
the
factor
s
that
big
fellow
will
speak
when
he
wants
to
said
one
of
the
strangers
as
the
three
men
walked
down
the
street
and
when
he
doesn
t
the
devil
himself
won
t
make
him
do
so
of
two
ways
to
the
factor
s
thora
had
taken
the
shortest
and
most
frequented
yet
she
had
gone
through
the
streets
unobserved
coming
near
the
house
she
had
passed
the
sheriff
and
the
two
strangers
but
they
were
immersed
in
their
conversation
and
did
not
see
her
as
she
stumbled
by
them
with
her
head
covered
up
in
anna
s
shawl
twice
she
had
stopped
to
take
breath
and
once
she
had
steadied
herself
by
a
for
she
was
dizzy
and
her
ankles
ached
the
little
distance
which
had
hitherto
seemed
so
short
was
now
a
great
journey
but
it
came
to
an
end
at
length
and
she
approached
her
father
s
house
from
the
front
she
had
intended
to
creep
up
softly
enter
by
stealth
listen
until
she
learned
where
the
child
was
kept
watch
until
aunt
margret
left
the
little
one
alone
for
a
moment
and
then
steal
into
the
room
and
take
it
with
this
purpose
she
ascended
the
stone
steps
to
the
front
entrance
and
gently
turned
the
handle
but
as
soon
as
she
had
given
the
door
a
noiseless
push
there
was
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
which
had
not
been
there
before
at
the
next
moment
there
was
a
sound
of
slippered
feet
coming
hurriedly
and
before
her
dizzy
brain
could
tell
what
to
do
aunt
margret
was
peering
into
her
face
mercy
me
is
it
you
cried
aunt
margret
and
she
looked
as
if
she
were
ready
to
drop
with
a
crushing
sense
of
failure
thora
stood
silent
and
her
heart
fluttered
like
a
captured
bird
good
lord
how
did
you
get
here
alone
and
what
on
earth
was
anna
doing
to
let
you
come
said
aunt
margret
then
with
a
convulsive
little
burst
thora
said
anna
knew
nothing
about
it
aunt
margret
she
was
asleep
i
came
to
see
baby
and
then
she
broke
down
utterly
leaned
against
the
doorpost
and
cried
like
a
child
the
kind
soul
with
the
sharp
tongue
could
bear
no
more
and
so
you
shall
dear
certainly
you
shall
my
pretty
poppet
she
said
with
infinite
compassion
as
sure
as
my
name
is
margret
neilsen
you
shall
she
said
again
with
stern
determination
they
have
left
me
here
as
a
with
an
order
that
nobody
is
to
come
near
the
child
but
that
was
meant
for
somebody
else
somebody
who
was
going
to
steal
it
so
they
said
though
what
a
grown
man
can
want
with
a
suckling
infant
it
baffles
my
stupid
old
head
to
see
but
what
a
silly
i
am
to
keep
you
at
the
door
come
my
precious
go
before
me
thora
dear
that
s
right
but
not
so
quick
you
shall
see
your
baby
soon
enough
and
thora
darling
if
i
haven
t
exactly
tried
to
take
it
back
to
you
it
wasn
t
because
i
didn
t
love
you
and
feel
for
you
and
suffer
with
you
my
poor
child
but
because
your
father
and
helga
and
even
oscar
no
the
other
way
thora
baby

in
the
front
bedroom

said
thora
breathing
quickly
as
she
reached
the
landing
she
s
as
well
as
well
and
so
rosy
and
bonny
look
said
aunt
margret
pushing
ahead
of
thora
and
opening
the
bedroom
door
but
having
climbed
the
stairs
so
much
too
rapidly
thora
paused
at
the
threshold
of
the
room
and
held
her
left
hand
hard
against
her
side
wait
i
can
t
go
in
yet
she
said
not
just
yet
aunt
margret
is
she
asleep
yes
she
s
fast
asleep
bless
her
is
that
her
breathing
no
that
s
the
cat
yes
it
is
the
baby
but
come
my
own
come
said
aunt
margret
and
then
holding
her
breath
the
young
mother
entered
the
room
the
child
was
sleeping
in
a
cradle
with
a
hood
covered
with
light
blue
lace
and
its
little
head
streaked
with
yellow
hair
lay
red
against
the
white
pillow
a
cat
purred
on
the
floor
in
a
warm
shaft
from
the
setting
sun
and
all
was
sweet
and
peaceful
my
baby
my
baby
cried
thora
and
she
sank
down
on
her
knees
by
the
cot
and
stretched
her
arms
over
it
like
a
bird
covering
its
nest
with
her
sheltering
wings
the
child
was
awakened
by
the
soft
gale
of
its
mother
s
breath
on
its
sleeping
face
and
it
began
to
cry
whereupon
thora
gathered
it
in
her
arms
and
lifted
it
out
of
the
cot
and
nursed
it
lovingly
holding
its
little
plunging
hand
in
her
own
hand
so
thin
and
white
and
delicate
it
s
her
bottle
she
wants
thora
said
aunt
margret
and
here
it
is
ready
and
waiting
i
keep
it
warm
on
the
top
of
the
stove
let
me
give
it
her
let
me
give
it
her
cried
thora
do
you
think
you
can
my
pretty
but
of
course
you
can
my
goodness
it
s
wonderful
when
a
person
is
a
mother
she
can
do
anything
with
a
baby
an
angel
seems
to
whisper
do
that
and
she
does
it
and
it
s
just
right
for
the
child
the
little
creature
was
now
sucking
vigorously
with
its
tiny
face
toward
the
mother
s
breast
and
its
plump
red
hand
on
her
pallid
cheek
but
it
s
you
that
wants
milk
my
child
said
aunt
margret
yes
and
some
spirits
too
and
you
shall
have
both
in
a
minute
lay
your
poor
head
against
this
pillow
my
precious
and
wait
while
i
get
the
decanter
the
child
was
now
dropping
off
to
sleep
and
thora
looked
lovingly
down
at
it
and
said
god
bless
my
motherless
baby
motherless
indeed
who
says
she
s
motherless
she
has
too
many
mothers
it
seems
to
me
said
aunt
margret
the
tit
slipped
from
the
child
s
slackening
lips
and
thora
leaned
down
and
kissed
away
the
drops
that
trickled
from
the
little
mouth
i
wish
i
could
die
she
said
i
wish
i
could
die
now
aunt
margret
and
aunt
margret
who
was
snuffling
audibly
said
die
indeed
just
drink
off
this
drop
of
brandy
and
water
and
don
t
talk
such
nonsense
thora
drank
the
brandy
and
straightway
her
weakness
left
her
and
with
the
return
of
her
strength
the
secret
purpose
which
had
brought
her
to
the
house
revived
i
must
be
quick
she
thought
anna
will
follow
me
the
innocent
selfishness
of
her
starved
and
injured
motherhood
knew
no
conscience
and
she
set
herself
to
consider
how
she
could
get
rid
of
aunt
margret
and
so
carry
away
the
child
that
was
a
perplexing
problem
and
she
sat
long
to
think
it
out
but
accident
solved
it
at
last
goodness
me
aunt
margret
was
saying
how
lovely
you
look
sitting
there
with
the
child
but
what
a
fit
some
people
would
have
if
they
could
drop
in
and
see
you
they
can
t
thank
goodness
they
re
thirty
miles
away
and
before
they
get
back
you
ll
be
gone
and
nobody
a
penny
the
wiser
when
the
cat
s
away
the
mice
will
play
but
mercy
me
what
a
storm
there
would
be
if
they
ever
came
to
know
that
i
had
let
you
touch
the
little
angel
i
don
t
know
which
is
the
worst
on
that
subject
your
father
or
oscar
or
helga
i
think
helga
is
the
worst
if
you
ask
me
you
re
a
neilsen
thora
but
helga
she
s
a
sheep
from
another
sheepfold
she
s
so
cute
and
she
has
such
ways
with
her
it
was
helga
who
put
those
bells
on
the
door
and
when
i
heard
you
coming
in
i
thought
it
s
that
sheriff
again
but
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
good
gracious
aunt
margret
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
suddenly
threw
up
her
hands
what
is
it
said
thora
it
is

yes
it
s
anna
and
the
sheriff
and
two
officers

coming
behind
her

thora

little
matter

sheriff

the
back
parlor
and
tell
them

thora

as
quiet

mouse
and
i
ll

there
was
the
clang
of
a
bell
from
below
and
aunt
margret
whispered
there
they
are
now

baby
back
in
the
cot
my
own
and
cover
her
up
with
the
blanket
not
yet
let
me
kiss
her
again
just
for
the
last
time
said
thora
an
agitated
voice
came
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
margret
margret
neilsen
i
must
go
be
quick
whispered
aunt
margret
and
scuttling
she
cried
i
m
coming
and
then
there
was
a
rumble
of
confused
voices
followed
by
the
closing
of
a
door
thora
was
alone
once
more
and
the
feverish
strength
of
outraged
motherhood
possessed
her
like
a
madness
they
ve
come
to
take
my
child
again
she
thought
in
a
moment
she
had
slipped
off
her
slippers
snatched
up
the
blanket
and
wrapped
it
about
the
sleeping
infant
crept
down
the
stairs
in
stocking
feet
and
out
of
the
house
by
a
back
passage
meantime
a
little
was
being
acted
in
the
back
parlor
anna
was
white
and
trembling
while
aunt
margret
was
looking
wondrous
wise
and
subtle
thora
gasped
anna
have
you
seen
anything
of
thora
have
seen
anything
of
thora
you
must
be
dreaming
anna
dear
then
she
has
gone
and
i
was
right
after
all
said
anna
can
it
be
possible
said
aunt
margret
magnus
would
have
it
that
she
had
gone
to
see
the
baby
but
she
has
gone
farther
than
that
poor
child
and
we
shall
never
see
her
again
what
a
pity
said
aunt
margret
and
then
anna
flew
out
at
her
margret
neilsen
don
t
you
understand
what
i
am
saying
the
poor
child
was
demented
and
she
stole
out
while
i
was
asleep
and
goodness
knows
what
she
has
done
with
herself
hush
hold
your
tongue
anna
and
come
into
this
room
and
i
ll
tell
you
something
magnus
was
right
after
all
then
she
has
been
here
she
s
here
now
she
s
this
very
minute
oh
thank
the
lord
don
t
speak
or
the
poor
thing
will
hear
you
and
don
t
be
angry
with
her
either
and
if
you
brought
the
sheriff
to
take
her
back
i
brought
the
sheriff
what
are
you
saying
you
crazy
woman
then
can
t
we
let
her
stay
a
little
longer
it
isn
t
every
day
she
has
the
chance
she
can
stay
all
night
for
me
margret
that
is
impossible
the
factor
is
so
frightened
and
then
there
s
the
governor
that
s
true
said
anna
but
she
can
safely
stay
an
hour
more
with
her
child
can
t
she
said
aunt
margret
just
one
hour
more
said
anna
poor
thing
she
was
to
steal
out
while
we
were
talking
but
we
ll
go
up
and
surprise
her
and
when
you
see
her
with
the
little
mite
at
her
breast
looking
down
at
it
and
kissing
it
with
such
a
pitiful
smile
the
dear
it
will
fill
your
heart
brimful
but
for
goodness
sake
wipe
your
eyes
and
blow
your
nose
anna
and
do
for
mercy
s
sake
look
more
cheerful
quietly
now
quietly
or
she
ll
think
the
sheriff
is
behind
us
with
that
the
two
old
things
snuffling
as
if
they
had
colds
in
the
head
but
struggling
to
smile
and
seem
happy
went
creeping
up
to
the
bedroom
by
that
time
the
room
was
empty
and
thora
was
gone
the
women
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
and
then
aunt
margret
ran
to
the
cradle
the
child
was
gone
too
at
that
moment
the
bell
of
the
front
door
rang
again
aunt
margret
cried
there
she
is
and
the
two
women
raced
to
see
it
was
magnus
coming
in
thora
has
been
here
but
she
has
gone
gone
this
very
minute
cried
anna
and
she
has
taken
the
child
along
with
her
cried
aunt
margret
without
a
word
magnus
turned
about
and
leapt
back
to
the
street
there
he
met
the
sheriff
and
told
him
what
had
happened
at
the
next
minute
the
two
women
were
running
hither
and
thither
and
the
two
men
were
gone
different
ways
half
an
hour
afterward
they
met
at
the
factor
s
house
again
thora
and
the
child
had
not
been
found
they
had
disappeared
as
utterly
as
if
a
lava
stream
had
swallowed
them
the
women
were
sitting
side
by
side
with
blanched
faces
and
startled
eyes
twisting
their
handkerchiefs
into
knots
the
doctor
was
quite
right
after
all
said
anna
they
were
all
right
though
we
thought
them
so
hard
and
cruel
the
poor
thing
wanted
to
die
she
told
me
so
herself
she
told
me
too
she
told
me
this
very
day
said
aunt
margret
is
there
no
house
in
town
she
was
accustomed
to
go
to
asked
the
sheriff
none
said
anna
and
aunt
margret
said
thora
was
not
like
that
she
would
never
drink
coffee
or
talk
scandal
with
any
one
let
us
try
again
said
magnus
to
the
sheriff
the
sun
had
set
over
the
fiord
and
the
black
rocks
of
the
plain
were
dying
out
in
the
dusky
haze
of
evening
when
the
two
men
returned
to
the
factor
s
for
the
second
time
their
search
had
been
fruitless
and
magnus
s
face
was
white
and
haggard
anna
and
aunt
margret
sat
in
the
parlor
window
stricken
with
grief
but
finding
a
certain
satisfaction
in
their
affliction
from
the
melancholy
glances
of
groups
of
other
women
who
had
gathered
in
the
street
i
knew
it
would
be
useless
said
anna
she
s
gone
poor
dear
i
m
afraid
she
s
gone
to
heaven
poor
darling
and
taken
the
little
innocent
infant
along
with
her
said
aunt
margret
has
anybody
thought
of
going
back
to
government
house
asked
the
sheriff
i
went
there
first
said
magnus
and
to
the
lake
i
went
there
next
and
the
jetty
i
went
to
the
jetty
also
but
i
don
t
believe
thora
has
destroyed
herself
said
magnus
then
she
has
died
of
exhaustion
by
this
time
and
it
s
all
the
same
in
any
case
said
anna
she
s
in
her
stocking
feet
too
see
said
aunt
margret
showing
the
slippers
which
thora
had
left
and
falling
to
kissing
and
weeping
over
them
there
s
one
chance
left
she
may
have
tried
to
follow
her
husband
said
magnus
so
far
and
without
a
horse
said
the
sheriff
it
s
the
last
hope
i
m
going
to
follow
it
up
said
magnus
mother
he
added
you
had
better
go
back
home
i
can
t
i
daren
t
and
if
anything
happens
i
ll
never
be
able
to
go
into
the
poor
girl
s
room
again
said
anna
outside
in
the
fading
light
magnus
stood
for
a
moment
wiping
the
flanks
of
golden
mane
and
patting
his
drooping
neck
i
suppose
there
isn
t
another
horse
left
in
the
town
said
the
sheriff
but
you
ll
kill
your
splendid
pony
then
he
ll
die
well
said
magnus
magnus
the
sheriff
continued
i
intend
to
search
every
house
in
reykjavik
and
if
i
succeed
i
ll
expect
you
to
help
us
in
the
morning
if
you
don
t
succeed
i
ll
help
you
said
magnus
with
a
hoarse
laugh
and
at
the
next
moment
he
was
lost
in
the
darkness
thora
had
done
the
most
natural
and
therefore
the
most
unexpected
thing
only
thinking
of
getting
back
to
her
bed
in
government
house
and
of
carrying
the
child
along
with
her
she
had
taken
the
simplest
means
toward
doing
so
in
order
to
escape
the
sheriff
she
had
left
her
father
s
house
by
the
back
and
to
avoid
observation
from
people
in
the
frequented
thoroughfare
she
had
taken
the
longer
and
quieter
of
the
two
roads
home
this
road
led
her
past
the
lake
but
she
had
no
desire
to
destroy
herself
often
before
she
had
longed
for
death
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
but
love
for
her
child
conquered
all
such
feelings
now
the
way
was
very
long
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
tired
the
roads
were
rough
but
she
did
not
feel
that
they
were
cutting
her
feet
she
was
going
fast
but
she
did
not
realize
that
she
was
breathless
she
had
only
one
fear
the
fear
of
being
overtaken
only
one
dread
the
dread
of
the
child
being
torn
away
from
her
clinging
to
the
little
one
with
feverish
arms
she
hastened
along
weeping
to
herself
laughing
to
herself
full
of
a
wild
joy
that
had
no
remorse
no
qualms
of
any
kind
and
neither
looked
before
nor
after
it
was
motherhood
the
most
divine
the
most
devilish
the
most
tender
the
most
terrible
the
most
sweet
the
most
sublime
the
most
savage
of
all
the
passions
of
the
heart
reaching
home
at
last
she
found
the
house
silent
but
every
room
wide
open
as
if
lately
ringing
with
the
noise
of
hurrying
feet
creeping
with
her
precious
burden
she
got
safely
back
to
her
room
and
instantly
locked
the
door
behind
her
she
laughed
as
she
did
so
thinking
how
anna
and
aunt
margret
would
follow
her
and
find
themselves
defeated
then
she
undressed
and
got
back
into
bed
and
for
one
long
heavenly
hour
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
delight
of
having
her
child
to
hold
it
to
nurse
it
to
fondle
it
to
kiss
it
and
to
devour
it
with
all
her
senses
the
little
creature
had
slept
during
its
journey
through
the
town
but
now
it
awoke
and
lay
quiet
by
its
mother
s
side
while
she
ran
her
hungry
hands
over
its
tiny
body
and
put
its
clinched
fists
and
its
feet
one
by
one
into
her
mouth
after
a
while
the
child
tired
and
began
to
cry
whereupon
thora
remembered
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
left
its
behind
her
she
tried
to
hush
it
but
it
would
not
be
hushed
and
then
a
sudden
thought
a
blind
impulse
of
maternity
came
to
her
and
she
put
the
little
one
to
her
breast
the
child
clung
to
it
and
was
quiet
and
the
milk
which
had
never
come
until
now
instantly
began
to
flow
it
was
the
crowning
miracle
of
that
joyous
hour
a
physical
rapture
such
as
thora
had
never
known
before
after
that
a
more
tender
spirit
stole
over
her
and
she
looked
lovingly
down
at
the
child
in
her
bosom
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
and
said
god
bless
my
baby
then
in
a
voice
so
weak
and
silvery
that
it
was
like
a
voice
descending
from
the
sky
she
began
to
sing
the
child
to
sleep
sleep
baby
sleep
angela
bright
thy
slumbers
keep
sleep
baby
sleep
the
child
slept
and
even
while
she
sang
thora
became
aware
of
alternate
waves
of
heat
and
cold
going
over
her
a
vague
broken
delirious
consciousness
came
and
went
and
people
seemed
to
be
entering
and
leaving
the
room
first
it
was
helga
then
it
was
oscar
and
finally
it
was
magnus
helga
was
taking
the
child
out
of
the
bed
and
oscar
was
helping
her
and
she
was
trying
to
cry
out
and
could
not
when
magnus
appeared
in
the
doorway
at
one
moment
she
thought
she
was
dead
and
people
were
talking
around
her
they
were
all
strangers
chiefly
women
whom
she
had
seen
going
into
the
salvation
shelter
she
s
gone
poor
girl
said
some
one
and
somebody
else
said
so
much
the
better
the
poor
thing
s
troubles
are
over
they
say
she
tried
to
make
away
with
herself
said
one
and
what
wonder
said
another
there
was
no
place
left
for
her
in
this
world
nobody
can
say
she
didn
t
love
her
husband
said
a
voice
at
her
feet
that
was
the
pity
he
loved
her
sister
said
a
voice
above
her
perhaps
that
was
why
she
thought
of
taking
her
life
to
leave
him
free
perhaps
to
make
him
happy
well
she
did
wrong
by
magnus
but
we
all
know
who
killed
her
and
then
everybody
said
in
chorus
he
ll
get
his
reward
he
ll
get
his
reward
and
she
was
sorry
for
oscar
at
another
moment
she
thought
she
was
a
blessed
saint
in
paradise
with
lilies
and
roses
around
her
head
but
there
was
a
thorn
in
her
heart
for
all
that
and
even
among
the
joys
of
heaven
she
had
a
dull
pain
there
was
no
ease
for
because
she
could
not
help
thinking
about
her
baby
so
she
asked
the
dear
god
to
let
her
go
down
to
earth
to
see
her
little
elin
and
he
suffered
her
to
come
and
she
came
oscar
and
helga
were
together
now
in
a
country
that
was
sweet
with
smiling
gardens
and
a
house
that
was
full
of
gilded
furniture
but
she
could
not
see
her
elin
anywhere
until
at
length
she
found
her
in
an
upper
room
neglected
and
lonely
then
the
burning
tears
ran
down
her
face
and
she
sat
by
her
child
and
comforted
her
and
elin
was
not
afraid
stay
with
me
a
little
longer
said
the
child
and
she
stayed
with
her
and
sang
to
her
and
no
one
heard
but
little
elin
sleep
baby
sleep
angels
bright
thy
slumbers
keep
sleep
baby
sleep
when
she
came
to
herself
again
it
was
dark
in
the
bedroom
yet
she
was
still
singing
the
baby
began
to
cry
and
she
wished
to
comfort
it
but
she
found
she
could
not
speak
it
s
little
body
felt
cold
against
her
breast
and
she
wanted
to
cover
it
up
in
the
blanket
but
her
arms
were
heavy
and
she
could
not
lift
them
there
was
a
moment
of
agonized
consciousness
but
the
good
father
sealed
the
senses
of
his
suffering
child
again
she
thought
a
majestic
figure
entered
the
room
clothed
all
in
white
and
lifted
the
baby
out
of
her
bosom
saying
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
she
knew
quite
well
who
it
was
but
when
she
looked
a
second
time
the
figure
had
the
face
of
magnus
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
she
herself
and
not
the
baby
that
had
been
lifted
up
yet
she
felt
no
fear
at
all
nor
any
pain
nor
any
heartache
at
that
moment
the
women
who
had
stood
about
the
bed
came
back
and
they
began
to
sing
safe
in
the
arms
of
jesus
just
as
she
had
heard
them
singing
it
when
she
listened
at
the
door
of
the
shelter
she
smiled
and
drew
a
deep
sigh
a
sweet
long
breath
of
joy
and
rapture
and
then
the
darkness
lifted
and
it
was
day
that
day
had
been
a
prolonged
triumph
for
oscar
the
festival
of
the
proclamation
began
with
service
in
the
parish
church
and
though
the
governor
and
the
thingmen
only
had
been
able
to
pack
into
the
little
place
the
churchyard
outside
and
the
of
the
parsonage
had
been
thronged
after
the
service
there
was
a
procession
from
the
church
door
to
the
ancient
place
of
proclamation
and
oscar
had
ordered
and
marshaled
every
one
first
the
town
band
then
the
governor
and
his
executive
in
their
uniforms
the
bishop
in
his
robes
the
thingmen
in
their
scarfs
the
clergy
in
their
black
cassocks
and
white
ruffs
and
finally
a
vast
following
of
the
people
it
was
a
gorgeous
spectacle
such
as
no
man
could
remember
to
have
seen
on
that
spot
before
the
proclamation
itself
was
an
imposing
ceremony
sitting
on
the
as
on
a
natural
platform
of
lava
rock
with
his
face
to
the
east
and
the
cross
of
dannebrog
on
his
breast
the
governor
read
out
one
by
one
the
titles
and
descriptions
of
the
acts
which
had
been
passed
by
parliament
and
after
each
of
them
he
lifted
his
head
and
cried
to
the
people
on
the
plains
below
is
it
yea
or
nay
and
then
the
people
led
by
oscar
shouted
yea
when
the
reading
was
finished
the
governor
cried
long
live
the
king
whereupon
oscar
led
the
cheering
three
times
three
and
when
the
band
struck
up
the
national
hymn
he
started
the
words
of
the
chorus
but
the
last
feature
of
the
function
was
the
best
and
that
was
the
singing
of
the
hymn
composed
by
oscar
himself
it
was
a
hymn
to
iceland
the
cradle
of
the
vikings
the
scene
of
the
sagas
the
parent
of
parliaments
the
mother
of
the
mighty
northlands
standing
under
the
brant
face
of
the
with
his
choir
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
on
the
sloping
ground
in
front
oscar
conducted
with
great
vigor
his
prelude
pleased
the
people
but
when
he
rose
to
the
height
of
his
argument
and
struck
the
patriotic
note
his
love
for
the
stern
old
northland
isafold
my
isafold
great
land
of
frost
and
fire
his
hearers
were
carried
away
and
some
of
them
shouted
and
wept
after
the
hymn
was
over
the
thingmen
crowded
about
oscar
to
congratulate
him
and
some
of
the
fell
upon
his
neck
the
governor
too
sitting
above
was
the
object
of
many
congratulations
but
this
is
genius
said
one
an
inspiration
said
another
our
oscar
will
be
a
great
musician
some
day
said
a
third
and
the
old
man
took
the
tributes
quietly
almost
silently
but
with
the
shining
face
of
a
father
proud
of
his
favorite
son
when
the
ceremonies
ended
only
one
name
was
on
everybody
s
lips
and
that
was
the
name
of
oscar
stephenson
and
hundreds
hummed
the
strains
of
isafold
my
isafold
as
they
trooped
off
to
dinner
oscar
and
helga
dined
together
at
the
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
which
was
thronged
with
guests
but
they
were
both
too
much
excited
to
remain
in
mixed
company
and
after
dinner
they
escaped
to
the
margin
of
the
lake
and
to
the
solitary
parts
of
the
plain
there
they
gathered
blueberries
and
partly
to
restrain
their
excitement
and
partly
to
nourish
it
they
talked
of
nothing
but
the
wild
flowers
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
they
returned
by
way
of
the
parsonage
where
the
governor
with
the
factor
the
bishop
and
certain
other
officials
had
taken
their
dinner
apart
the
little
guest
room
was
dense
with
smoke
like
the
mouth
of
a
geyser
and
the
faces
that
came
and
went
in
it
were
discussing
the
merits
and
defects
of
the
old
order
and
the
new
both
governor
and
factor
were
for
the
old
as
exemplified
by
the
day
s
ceremony
and
oscar
s
hymn
but
others
held
that
changing
times
brought
changing
needs
and
that
iceland
would
be
the
better
for
a
new
constitution
with
free
trade
and
modern
methods
they
ll
go
on
till
midnight
and
never
get
home
whispered
helga
as
she
slipped
out
with
oscar
on
returning
to
the
farm
they
found
people
striking
tents
and
leading
horses
from
the
crowded
horsefold
to
prepare
for
the
return
journey
i
m
afraid
i
m
too
tired
to
go
back
said
helga
then
stay
stay
by
all
means
said
oscar
and
you
asked
helga
i
must
go
home
in
any
case
there
s
thora
said
oscar
your
mother
will
look
after
her
said
helga
but
oscar
shook
his
head
and
ordered
gudrun
the
housekeeper
to
make
one
of
the
two
ready
for
helga
at
that
moment
some
young
townspeople
were
clearing
the
floor
for
a
dance
and
they
called
on
oscar
and
helga
to
lead
off
with
a
waltz
they
did
so
with
great
delight
and
when
the
waltz
was
finished
they
joined
the
round
dance
which
followed
it
and
then
they
danced
a
second
and
a
third
waltz
until
they
were
flushed
and
hot
and
had
to
go
out
to
cool
by
this
time
it
was
dark
and
the
people
who
meant
to
encamp
for
the
night
had
lighted
fires
at
the
mouths
of
their
tents
and
were
beguiling
the
hours
with
various
pleasures
one
of
these
was
an
old
woman
not
thought
to
be
overwise
was
going
from
tent
to
tent
making
random
shots
amid
shrieks
of
laughter
and
what
do
you
see
here
said
helga
holding
out
her
hand
ah
this
is
a
good
hand
said
the
witch
you
are
going
to
be
a
great
lady
and
eat
mutton
and
beef
every
day
and
drink
golden
wine
and
ginger
and
what
do
you
see
in
this
asked
oscar
this
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
the
witch
what
s
amiss
mother
cold
water
runs
between
my
skin
and
my
flesh
is
it
as
bad
as
that
old
lady
don
t
ask
me
don
t
ask
me
you
have
a
brother
haven
t
you
and
if
i
have
what
about
him
beware
beware
said
the
witch
and
oscar
and
helga
turned
away
laughing
the
moon
rose
and
they
wandered
into
the
great
chasm
and
walked
among
the
shadows
of
the
toppling
stones
until
they
came
under
a
huge
stone
called
stoker
which
stands
like
a
mighty
gravestone
over
a
deep
pit
that
is
like
a
tomb
there
they
sat
with
the
white
moon
above
and
the
red
camp
fires
below
them
and
then
the
boiling
bubbling
geyser
of
excitement
in
their
breasts
could
be
kept
down
no
longer
you
have
had
a
great
success
oscar
said
helga
so
have
you
helga
so
have
you
for
without
your
presence
to
prompt
and
inspire
me
i
should
have
done
nothing
i
am
happy
if
i
have
helped
you
oscar
but
you
must
go
on
now
and
never
look
back
never
you
are
right
helga
you
are
right
to
stop
would
be
a
sin
an
unpardonable
sin
almost
like
a
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
exactly
like
it
oscar
for
if
any
one
has
a
gift
he
gets
it
from
god
and
to
bury
it
like
the
man
in
the
parable
there
would
be
no
fear
of
that
if
i
could
have
you
beside
me
always
helga
and
can
t
you
oscar
a
fragrance
seemed
to
envelop
him
he
felt
helga
s
breath
upon
his
face
it
made
him
tremble
all
over
would
to
god
i
could
but
it
is
impossible
you
will
return
to
denmark
not
i
indeed
i
am
not
without
my
own
ambitious
also
i
must
go
back
to
england
to
france
to
germany
to
italy
and
so
must
you
oscar
you
must
if
you
are
to
be
true
to
your
talents
and
to
yourself
and
to
the
great
future
i
know
it
helga
i
feel
it
and
if
i
could
write
even
one
song
that
would
stir
the
souls
of
millions
it
would
be
better
than
making
a
fortune
or
passing
an
act
of
parliament
but
when
a
man
has
given
hostages
to
fortune
and
they
are
dragging
him
down
with
silken
threads
perhaps
but
still
down
down
down
he
was
speaking
out
of
a
dry
and
husky
throat
but
she
answered
softly
and
sweetly
are
things
so
absolutely
irretrievable
oscar
absolutely
helga
absolutely
and
henceforth
and
all
my
life
long
i
must
learn
to
go
without
your
comradeship
and
what
must
i
do
the
compulsion
of
passion
was
driving
him
on
but
he
was
struggling
to
hold
back
helga
he
cried
do
you
know
what
is
the
deadliest
thing
in
life
it
is
love
the
painters
paint
love
as
a
harmless
little
cupid
with
a
handkerchief
about
his
eyes
and
a
tiny
bow
and
arrow
in
his
hands
but
love
is
a
great
blind
blundering
monster
with
a
sword
dealing
destruction
on
every
side
his
words
were
as
nothing
but
his
quivering
voice
sang
like
music
in
helga
s
ears
and
she
said
is
it
love
or
man
that
does
that
oscar
man
with
the
false
sense
of
right
and
wrong
his
foolish
ideals
of
honor
god
knows
perhaps
if
i
could
have
thought
so
a
year
ago
before
i
added
injury
to
injury
and
brought
unhappiness
on
others
but
now
now
a
sensation
of
triumph
came
to
her
and
she
said
isn
t
it
cowardly
to
talk
like
that
oscar
i
am
a
coward
helga
he
answered
trembling
from
head
to
foot
to
you
i
can
speak
the
truth
i
am
a
coward
a
moral
coward
and
i
can
not
face
the
certainty
but
if
said
helga
excitedly
getting
closer
you
had
some
one
beside
you
who
had
the
courage
of
life
the
defiance
of
life
helga
cried
oscar
breathing
heavily
the
earth
seemed
to
be
slipping
under
him
like
an
avalanche
some
one
who
would
go
on
helping
you
and
ask
nothing
but
your
comradeship
helga
helga
he
was
gasping
as
for
breath
in
the
intoxication
of
his
emotion
nothing
but
to
work
with
you
and
to
conquer
the
world
with
you
helga
helga
helga
oscar
there
was
a
breathless
cry
from
both
and
then
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
i
shall
not
go
back
helga
when
they
came
to
themselves
again
they
were
returning
more
flushed
and
excited
than
before
out
of
the
white
moonlight
into
the
yellow
mist
of
the
smoking
lamp
that
hung
over
the
dancers
in
the
hall
the
young
townspeople
received
them
with
a
shout
and
called
on
them
to
join
the
dance
they
were
dancing
it
was
called
weaving
the
cloth
and
the
figures
were
intended
to
represent
the
spinning
and
carding
the
weaving
stretching
hammering
and
rolling
of
the
thick
icelandic
vadmal
the
dancers
crossed
and
recrossed
twisted
each
other
about
beat
each
other
breast
against
breast
and
finally
rolled
each
other
round
and
round
the
music
was
going
fast
and
the
dancers
were
singing
loud
and
laughing
louder
when
there
came
from
outside
the
sudden
barking
of
dogs
followed
by
the
clatter
of
the
hoofs
of
a
galloping
horse
immediately
afterward
there
was
the
rattle
of
the
metal
end
of
a
against
a
and
a
voice
crying
god
be
with
you
the
did
not
wait
for
the
customary
answer
to
his
salutation
but
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
hurriedly
it
was
magnus
dusty
and
dirty
with
a
white
face
and
wild
eyes
at
that
moment
oscar
and
helga
blushing
and
smiling
were
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
performing
the
last
figure
of
the
dance
and
it
was
thus
that
magnus
came
face
to
face
with
them
is
she
here
he
cried
she
thora
she
is
lost
i
thought
she
might
have
found
a
horse
and
followed
you
then
the
shuffling
feet
stopped
and
the
fiddles
tailed
off
into
silence
as
magnus
in
broken
sentences
told
the
story
of
thora
s
flight
to
the
factor
s
her
disappearance
with
the
child
and
the
vain
search
that
had
been
made
for
her
but
surely
she
would
go
back
to
government
house
eventually
said
oscar
the
poor
girl
would
go
the
long
way
round
to
escape
observation
and
home
by
way
of
the
lake
did
nobody
think
of
that
and
stay
in
the
house
to
see
magnus
looked
like
a
man
whose
eyes
dulled
by
groping
in
a
dark
tunnel
had
been
stunned
by
sudden
light
before
the
others
had
recovered
themselves
he
had
turned
about
and
was
gone
at
the
next
moment
oscar
was
tramping
to
and
fro
on
the
floor
with
his
clinched
fists
to
his
forehead
moaning
my
god
my
god
helga
was
combing
her
hair
and
putting
on
her
wraps
john
the
servant
at
the
farm
was
sent
over
to
the
parsonage
to
tell
the
governor
and
the
factor
he
found
the
gentlemen
settling
themselves
for
the
night
having
talked
so
long
that
they
had
decided
to
remain
until
morning
but
the
news
of
thora
s
disappearance
altered
everything
we
must
go
back
immediately
said
the
governor
bring
the
horses
round
instantly
said
the
factor
less
than
half
an
hour
afterward
a
silent
and
gloomy
company
were
going
home
the
governor
the
factor
oscar
helga
and
a
various
following
of
the
sympathetic
and
the
inquisitive
the
two
old
friends
were
morose
and
and
for
the
first
time
in
fifty
years
disposed
to
nag
and
quarrel
the
governor
blamed
aunt
margret
the
factor
blamed
anna
the
governor
blamed
helga
the
factor
blamed
oscar
the
governor
blamed
the
factor
and
the
factor
blamed
the
governor
in
the
half
light
of
uncertainty
and
suspense
their
friendship
fell
before
fear
and
blood
was
thicker
than
water
it
was
a
miserable
to
oscar
the
explanation
of
thora
s
movements
with
which
he
had
surprised
magnus
soon
ceased
to
satisfy
himself
and
he
thought
of
a
hundred
fatal
consequences
helga
tried
to
comfort
him
with
various
plausible
arguments
he
had
acted
for
the
best
the
best
for
thora
the
best
for
the
child
the
best
for
himself
the
best
for
everybody
and
if
accident
had
intervened
or
the
dreadful
freaks
of
dementia
had
followed
he
was
not
responsible
and
could
not
be
blamed
but
oscar
s
worst
sufferings
were
from
a
secret
purgatory
which
helga
s
pleadings
did
not
touch
for
the
cruelest
part
of
his
remorse
concerned
helga
herself
the
journey
was
long
and
tiresome
and
every
step
had
its
own
peculiar
misery
during
the
first
hour
the
moon
was
shining
a
brilliant
moon
that
bathed
everything
in
loveliness
and
oscar
remembered
the
scene
in
the
chasm
and
reflected
that
in
the
very
hour
of
his
delirious
happiness
thora
perhaps
was
lying
dead
then
the
moon
died
out
and
darkness
fell
a
murky
darkness
blacker
than
the
lava
and
as
oscar
pushed
and
plunged
along
over
the
stumbles
of
his
pony
the
thought
came
to
him
that
if
thora
were
dead
perhaps
it
was
the
best
that
could
have
happened
to
her
the
best
under
the
circumstances
saving
her
from
the
bitterness
of
a
future
which
must
surely
come
when
helga
and
he
struggle
as
they
might
would
have
to
break
the
bonds
that
bound
them
and
then
in
that
dark
and
treacherous
hour
with
no
face
to
look
into
his
face
he
felt
an
immense
relief
remembering
that
if
thora
was
gone
the
consequences
of
his
life
s
error
were
at
an
end
and
he
was
free
but
the
dawn
came
a
bleared
rainy
dawn
with
scarfs
of
vapor
stretching
across
the
sun
like
a
cataract
over
a
eye
and
oscar
s
remorse
was
doubled
by
the
wounds
he
had
inflicted
upon
his
conscience
in
the
darkness
and
he
dare
not
look
at
helga
as
she
rode
muffled
up
and
silent
by
his
side
they
were
crossing
the
moss
fell
heath
by
this
time
and
everything
around
was
dark
and
drear
a
solitary
raven
kept
them
cheerless
company
for
a
while
flying
from
beacon
to
beacon
and
uttering
its
husky
cry
oscar
remembered
the
scenes
of
yesterday
when
the
sky
was
blue
and
their
blood
was
warm
and
then
the
thought
came
to
him
like
the
shooting
of
the
bolt
on
a
man
buried
in
a
tomb
that
if
he
was
not
to
be
henceforward
the
most
miserable
of
men
he
must
pray
with
all
his
soul
and
strength
that
when
they
reached
the
end
of
their
journey
thora
should
be
alive
on
reaching
the
more
inhabited
districts
oscar
allowed
the
governor
and
the
factor
to
forge
on
ahead
and
helga
to
wait
for
him
in
the
road
while
he
glanced
off
to
the
farmhouses
and
shouted
up
at
the
bedroom
windows
but
the
result
was
always
the
same
thora
had
not
been
seen
and
magnus
had
been
there
before
him
when
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
from
which
they
had
looked
back
on
reykjavik
and
on
the
danish
entering
the
fiord
the
little
capital
floated
in
the
mist
of
morning
like
a
city
in
a
woolly
sea
and
the
laura
lay
anchored
outside
of
it
but
the
apprehensions
of
yesterday
were
consumed
by
the
fears
of
and
oscar
thought
of
one
thing
alone
they
met
farmers
trotting
out
of
the
town
on
their
little
caravans
of
ponies
yet
oscar
did
not
question
them
lest
he
should
hear
the
news
he
dare
not
listen
to
and
coming
at
length
to
the
long
street
of
the
little
capital
he
did
not
raise
his
face
to
the
eyes
that
peered
at
him
through
the
curtains
of
upper
windows
lest
they
should
reveal
the
truth
he
dared
not
learn
the
fear
of
disaster
had
by
this
time
swallowed
up
any
flicker
of
hope
in
oscar
and
when
coming
up
to
government
house
he
found
a
crowd
of
people
standing
in
front
of
it
he
knew
too
well
that
all
was
over
from
that
moment
onward
fact
after
fact
led
up
to
the
fatal
certainty
the
window
of
thora
s
bedroom
the
window
at
which
oscar
had
shouted
his
adieus
the
day
before
stood
open
and
a
ladder
had
been
raised
against
it
by
the
gate
to
the
green
a
horse
lay
dead
on
the
gravel
it
was
magnus
s
horse
his
magnificent
golden
mane
covered
with
dust
and
sweat
as
it
fell
under
its
rider
at
the
last
step
of
his
fearful
journey
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
anna
and
aunt
margret
stood
with
the
governor
and
the
factor
sobbing
out
their
pitiful
explanations
afraid
to
return
to
the
empty
house
which
had
been
the
scene
of
a
painful
memory
anna
had
sat
the
night
through
with
margret
at
the
factor
s
waiting
hour
after
hour
for
the
reports
of
the
sheriff
and
his
constables
nothing
had
been
heard
of
thora
but
in
the
early
morning
magnus
had
returned
and
found
the
door
of
her
room
locked
on
the
inside
then
he
had
run
for
them
and
they
had
called
to
thora
but
received
no
answer
though
sometimes
they
heard
the
baby
crying
and
now
magnus
having
failed
to
force
the
door
had
gone
for
a
ladder
and
he
intended
to
climb
into
the
room
from
the
outside
oscar
was
conscious
of
no
more
until
he
found
himself
knocking
at
thora
s
door
and
calling
in
his
agony
thora
thora
thora
there
was
a
heavy
staggering
step
inside
the
room
the
lock
was
thrust
back
and
the
door
thrown
open
thora
cried
oscar
again
but
it
was
magnus
who
stood
before
him
magnus
with
a
face
white
and
set
and
full
of
anger
and
hatred
you
were
right
he
said
pointing
to
the
bed
there
she
is
with
god
and
you
thora
lay
high
on
the
pillow
with
her
eyes
open
and
her
parted
lips
smiling
as
if
she
had
just
awakened
from
a
beautiful
dream
she
was
dead
but
her
baby
was
alive
and
it
was
rolling
its
little
round
head
and
digging
its
red
hand
into
her
cold
white
breast
with
a
low
choking
cry
oscar
fell
to
his
knees
at
the
bedside
and
buried
his
face
in
the
bedclothes
magnus
left
the
room
the
others
entered
it
and
aunt
margret
lifted
the
living
child
out
of
the
mother
s
breast
over
the
father
s
kneeling
form
during
the
few
days
before
the
funeral
the
government
house
felt
motionless
and
empty
like
a
room
when
the
clock
has
stopped
in
it
behind
the
drawn
blinds
everybody
talked
in
whispers
as
if
the
dead
were
asleep
and
must
not
be
wakened
the
stillness
of
the
house
centered
in
the
room
where
thora
lay
and
that
was
white
and
fresh
with
the
odor
of
clean
linen
and
wild
flowers
in
the
deadened
sunshine
as
it
filtered
through
the
yellow
blinds
there
was
a
halo
about
the
waxen
face
on
the
bed
and
it
seemed
to
diffuse
solemnity
on
all
around
it
anna
never
allowed
herself
to
be
long
away
from
this
chamber
her
fear
of
the
room
had
gone
now
that
death
had
entered
it
early
and
late
in
daylight
and
dark
she
went
to
and
fro
in
the
silent
place
walking
softly
and
seeming
to
count
the
hours
during
which
her
dear
girl
would
be
above
ground
the
governor
did
nothing
from
the
day
of
thora
s
death
until
the
day
of
her
burial
dressed
always
in
his
official
uniform
he
sat
in
his
bureau
but
received
no
one
he
wrote
no
letters
and
read
no
books
and
seldom
spoke
at
his
meals
for
hours
together
he
would
sit
with
folded
arms
looking
fixedly
at
the
pattern
on
the
carpet
a
shadow
had
fallen
on
him
a
shadow
of
shame
and
in
the
sealed
chamber
of
his
proud
soul
he
was
struggling
to
reconcile
his
conduct
to
himself
and
finding
it
difficult
to
do
so
the
factor
went
on
with
his
work
as
usual
for
in
the
decalogue
of
his
duty
there
was
no
maxim
that
forbade
business
but
sometimes
as
he
turned
the
leaves
of
his
ledger
he
looked
long
and
saw
nothing
and
once
as
he
counted
up
the
figures
in
his
the
thought
smote
him
with
the
force
of
a
blow
on
the
brain
that
perhaps
nature
was
beginning
to
strike
a
balance
with
him
against
the
sum
of
his
successors
and
that
the
cruel
bereavement
which
had
just
befallen
him
was
the
first
stroke
of
the
nemesis
which
was
to
follow
in
the
wake
of
his
wealth
aunt
margret
and
helga
were
always
at
home
the
one
busy
with
the
baby
which
had
been
taken
back
to
the
factor
s
and
the
other
with
the
black
which
had
to
be
ordered
for
everybody
little
was
known
of
magnus
except
that
he
was
still
in
town
that
he
had
been
seen
with
the
sheriff
and
two
strangers
that
in
spite
of
the
trouble
which
had
overtaken
his
family
he
was
spending
most
of
his
time
in
the
dark
of
the
hotel
and
that
he
was
said
to
be
drinking
heavily
but
the
grief
of
oscar
touched
and
satisfied
everybody
he
had
eaten
little
and
had
never
been
known
to
sleep
sometimes
he
was
seen
to
be
sitting
apart
and
weeping
silently
sometimes
he
was
moving
from
room
to
room
as
if
every
spot
on
which
his
eye
could
rest
was
charged
with
the
memory
of
happy
days
that
were
dead
sometimes
he
was
heard
in
the
white
room
in
which
thora
lay
the
room
in
which
she
had
been
so
merry
and
so
sad
so
wild
with
delirium
and
so
happy
with
her
baby
and
there
he
was
sobbing
out
his
wild
regrets
in
muffled
cries
of
forgive
me
forgive
me
once
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
was
heard
at
the
harmonium
in
the
room
below
the
death
chamber
playing
softly
a
pitiful
lament
which
awakened
his
father
and
mother
and
brought
the
salt
tears
to
their
eyes
the
desolate
soul
in
these
ghastly
hours
was
prostrating
itself
in
the
dust
death
strikes
sternly
and
oscar
in
his
penitence
was
accusing
himself
of
every
crime
he
had
killed
thora
not
her
body
only
but
her
heart
that
faithful
heart
which
had
loved
him
so
deeply
so
tenderly
so
passionately
in
this
condition
he
looked
back
on
the
path
of
his
life
with
thora
and
every
step
as
he
now
saw
it
seemed
to
be
thick
set
with
the
stubble
of
sin
and
rank
with
the
weeds
of
when
he
returned
from
england
he
had
taken
thora
from
magnus
although
he
did
not
love
her
it
was
true
he
had
thought
he
loved
her
but
the
brotherly
thing
would
have
been
to
stand
back
in
silence
and
if
he
had
only
done
so
time
itself
would
have
undeceived
him
that
was
the
first
of
his
offenses
and
the
next
was
no
less
hideous
when
being
betrothed
to
thora
he
awoke
to
the
certainty
that
his
heart
was
with
helga
he
had
gone
on
with
his
bargain
and
led
the
girl
who
loved
him
into
a
loveless
marriage
it
was
true
he
thought
he
was
doing
his
duty
but
behind
duty
was
fear
fear
of
the
world
and
fear
of
magnus
while
the
courageous
thing
the
manly
thing
even
the
merciful
thing
would
have
been
to
stop
at
the
church
door
if
need
be
and
face
the
facts
and
take
the
consequences
but
having
cheated
thora
of
her
love
and
lied
to
her
at
the
altar
he
had
crowned
the
sum
of
his
sins
by
exposing
himself
to
the
temptation
of
infidelity
it
was
true
that
thora
herself
in
her
innocent
affection
had
paved
the
way
to
this
temptation
true
too
that
his
marriage
had
been
an
imperfect
partnership
but
all
the
same
his
course
had
been
clear
and
he
should
have
cut
himself
off
from
helga
at
once
and
for
ever
that
he
had
not
done
so
that
he
had
paltered
with
temptation
was
the
last
cause
of
this
terrible
calamity
thora
had
died
because
her
heart
was
dead
and
he
himself
had
killed
it
thus
the
desolate
soul
of
the
unhappy
man
laid
down
its
faults
at
the
feet
of
god
hiding
nothing
palliating
nothing
and
seeing
everything
in
naked
light
if
to
be
sorry
for
having
sinned
is
to
be
innocent
oscar
had
ceased
to
be
guilty
in
his
pitiful
but
useless
sorrow
in
the
dizzy
hours
of
pain
and
shame
when
the
wheel
of
life
goes
rapidly
oscar
asked
himself
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
thora
was
dead
and
something
whispered
helga
and
again
and
yet
again
something
whispered
helga
but
his
heart
would
not
listen
to
that
excuse
helga
had
not
been
to
blame
he
alone
had
been
at
fault
he
had
sacrificed
thora
to
his
ambitious
dreams
his
dreams
of
greatness
of
glory
helga
had
been
merely
the
symbol
of
those
dreams
and
thora
was
dead
because
he
had
tried
to
become
a
great
musician
but
the
past
was
past
and
when
oscar
asked
himself
what
punishment
he
could
impose
upon
himself
for
the
future
he
heard
but
one
answer
if
his
ambitions
had
been
the
cause
of
his
sin
to
bury
them
would
be
the
true
expression
of
his
repentance
he
bury
them
he
would
bury
his
genius
and
the
expectation
of
becoming
a
composer
in
the
grave
of
the
sweet
girl
he
had
destroyed
and
go
through
the
rest
of
his
life
in
the
drudgery
of
the
nearest
duty
eating
the
bread
of
affliction
in
obscurity
and
remorse
when
oscar
first
attempted
to
carry
out
this
resolution
it
was
in
a
scene
of
such
tragic
beauty
that
no
one
who
witnessed
it
could
ever
afterward
wipe
it
out
of
mind
the
family
had
gathered
for
that
last
office
of
love
which
makes
perhaps
the
saddest
moment
of
human
experience
sadder
than
the
moment
of
turning
away
from
the
newly
covered
grave
sadder
even
that
the
moment
of
returning
to
the
void
and
empty
home
the
moment
when
the
is
closed
down
and
the
beloved
face
disappears
for
ever
the
death
chamber
was
the
same
that
in
a
better
time
had
been
the
bridal
chamber
but
the
air
which
had
tingled
with
all
exquisite
thoughts
of
life
was
now
heavy
with
the
hush
of
death
it
was
and
the
same
lamp
burned
under
the
same
shade
while
a
lay
in
a
circle
of
lighted
candles
on
the
little
table
that
stood
by
the
bed
besides
the
members
of
the
family
only
two
persons
were
present
one
of
the
who
had
made
the
for
the
cathedral
and
had
just
put
the
last
stitch
to
the
garment
intended
for
a
darker
house
and
a
joiner
in
his
one
by
one
the
family
approached
the
bed
to
take
their
last
look
at
the
burden
that
lay
on
it
the
governor
with
a
solemn
tread
as
if
he
had
been
approaching
the
presence
of
a
king
the
factor
with
rigid
strides
and
a
bewildered
stare
and
helga
with
a
nervous
step
and
a
furtive
glance
as
if
duty
had
called
her
and
she
wished
herself
away
but
anna
and
aunt
margret
moved
about
the
body
without
dread
or
ceremony
laying
flowers
on
the
bosom
and
smoothing
the
soft
hair
that
was
dressed
down
the
cheek
as
if
the
dear
dead
belonged
to
them
by
right
of
nature
and
they
would
give
it
up
to
no
one
until
earth
herself
the
mother
of
us
all
should
claim
it
for
her
own
the
man
in
the
had
stepped
forward
to
finish
his
task
when
the
governor
held
up
his
hand
wait
where
is
oscar
he
asked
and
then
maria
the
old
housemaid
who
had
been
weeping
noiselessly
outside
the
door
was
sent
to
fetch
him
while
maria
was
away
aunt
margret
went
up
to
thora
and
whispered
over
her
my
precious
precious
pet
you
never
changed
to
your
stupid
old
auntie
did
you
not
even
when
she
kept
your
dear
baby
away
from
you
and
your
sweet
heart
was
broken
don
t
think
she
didn
t
love
you
for
all
that
my
precious
she
loved
you
every
minute
my
own
and
now
that
she
has
got
your
baby
she
intends
to
keep
it
she
will
keep
it
as
long
as
she
lives
so
don
t
you
ever
be
troubled
about
that
thora
aunt
margret
is
going
to
be
a
mother
to
your
little
girl
and
nobody
in
the
world
shall
ever
touch
a
hair
of
your
darling
s
head
it
was
at
this
moment
that
oscar
entered
the
room
with
old
maria
creeping
up
behind
him
his
pale
cheeks
and
sunken
eyes
testified
to
the
strength
of
his
remorse
but
his
step
was
firm
and
his
whole
figure
showed
intense
vitality
of
will
he
carried
a
bundle
of
papers
in
one
hand
and
they
were
loose
and
irregular
as
if
they
had
been
snatched
up
hurriedly
at
the
moment
he
was
called
in
the
utter
absorption
of
his
mood
he
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
anybody
or
anything
in
the
room
except
one
thing
the
thing
that
lay
upon
the
bed
and
walking
up
to
it
he
looked
down
at
the
white
face
and
spoke
to
it
as
if
the
dead
and
the
dead
alone
could
hear
thora
he
said
in
a
calm
voice
these
are
the
only
copies
of
my
compositions
and
i
wish
you
to
take
them
with
you
they
were
written
in
hours
when
your
faithful
heart
was
suffering
through
my
fault
when
i
neglected
you
and
deserted
you
for
the
sake
of
my
foolish
visions
of
art
and
greatness
that
was
the
real
cause
of
your
death
thora
and
in
punishment
of
myself
for
sacrificing
your
sweet
life
to
my
selfish
dreams
i
wish
to
bury
the
fruits
of
them
in
your
grave
take
them
then
and
let
them
lie
with
you
and
fade
with
you
and
be
forgotten
i
will
never
write
another
note
of
music
as
long
as
i
live
and
from
this
hour
onward
my
ambitions
are
at
an
end
saying
this
he
put
the
papers
beside
the
body
of
thora
and
wrapped
them
in
the
long
plaits
of
her
beautiful
hair
oscar
oscar
cried
helga
in
breathless
horror
the
others
listened
and
looked
on
hardly
realizing
what
oscar
had
resigned
but
helga
realized
it
and
she
was
trying
to
warn
him
against
the
sacrifice
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
and
at
such
a
moment
further
remonstrance
was
impossible
my
sweet
girl
said
oscar
stretching
both
arms
over
the
bed
forgive
me
for
all
my
failures
of
duty
oh
what
i
would
give
to
forget
them
now
but
i
can
t
i
can
t
you
are
gone
and
i
can
never
make
amends
thinking
to
put
an
end
to
a
scene
which
was
touching
everybody
too
deeply
the
governor
signed
to
the
man
in
the
but
when
the
man
stepped
forward
oscar
s
grief
broke
out
afresh
and
in
the
vehemence
of
his
sorrow
his
tongue
lost
all
control
of
itself
not
yet
he
cried
oh
god
thora
my
wife
my
sweet
young
wife
let
me
look
at
her
face
again
how
bright
and
happy
it
used
to
be
and
now
it
is
leaving
me
like
this
forgive
me
my
angel
say
you
forgive
me
before
you
go
i
can
not
live
without
your
forgiveness
i
wronged
you
and
sinned
against
you
but
you
were
good
and
your
childlike
heart
was
from
god
the
desolate
cry
rang
through
the
room
and
each
of
those
who
heard
the
revelation
of
the
naked
soul
read
it
by
the
light
of
his
own
helga
trembled
and
turned
to
the
window
the
governor
and
the
factor
dropped
their
heads
but
aunt
margret
cried
openly
in
innocent
sympathy
and
anna
touched
oscar
s
arm
and
tried
to
comfort
him
after
a
moment
oscar
became
more
calm
and
even
signed
to
the
man
himself
and
when
all
was
over
he
walked
firmly
and
courageously
out
of
the
room
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
oscar
was
weak
and
ill
and
more
fit
for
his
bed
than
for
a
journey
to
the
cemetery
but
no
one
could
prevail
on
him
not
to
go
the
morning
was
dull
and
drear
with
black
clouds
from
the
mountains
and
some
sprinklings
of
rain
and
when
the
dread
hour
struck
and
oscar
came
down
among
the
mourners
his
face
looked
ghastly
in
the
void
and
heavy
air
the
bell
in
the
cathedral
tower
began
to
toll
the
solemn
burden
was
borne
slowly
down
the
stairs
and
then
oscar
s
white
face
became
yet
more
white
and
he
would
have
fallen
but
for
his
father
s
arm
which
held
him
up
the
body
was
first
rested
on
the
green
outside
the
door
and
while
the
mourners
grouped
themselves
round
in
a
wide
to
sing
a
parting
hymn
oscar
stood
bareheaded
in
the
drizzling
rain
which
had
begun
to
fall
john
the
servant
stood
at
the
gate
holding
silvertop
thora
s
pony
which
he
had
brought
from
the
farm
to
carry
her
on
her
last
journey
and
the
sight
of
this
horse
seemed
to
be
more
than
oscar
could
bear
the
coffin
was
laid
on
the
panniers
and
the
procession
began
to
form
it
passed
through
deep
lines
of
the
townspeople
oscar
walking
first
after
the
body
alone
bareheaded
and
conscious
of
nothing
but
his
grief
the
bell
was
still
tolling
and
a
sabbath
quiet
had
fallen
over
the
town
the
cathedral
was
crowded
with
the
same
faces
that
had
looked
on
at
thora
s
wedding
when
she
came
down
from
the
altar
in
her
bloom
and
beauty
happy
and
smiling
on
her
husband
s
arm
and
now
that
she
was
being
carried
up
to
it
while
the
organ
played
the
funeral
march
and
oscar
walked
with
drooping
head
behind
the
people
nearest
the
aisle
said
he
was
weeping
audibly
the
coffin
in
its
pall
was
set
down
on
the
steps
to
the
communion
rail
the
spot
where
thora
had
knelt
as
a
young
girl
to
be
confirmed
and
as
a
bride
to
be
married
and
then
the
bishop
who
had
been
waiting
to
receive
it
delivered
a
consolatory
address
they
should
not
ask
themselves
why
this
sweet
and
lovely
life
had
been
so
ruthlessly
cut
off
the
ways
of
providence
were
inscrutable
but
god
was
in
heaven
and
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
did
right
neither
should
the
family
who
were
there
to
mourn
take
blame
to
themselves
for
what
had
occurred
for
if
it
had
pleased
the
almighty
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
afflicted
brain
of
their
dear
departed
sister
he
knew
best
why
he
did
so
and
to
what
end
it
was
done
rather
let
them
kneel
in
gratitude
to
god
that
in
his
mercy
he
had
not
suffered
her
to
lift
her
hand
against
herself
and
so
rob
them
of
the
blessed
hope
of
eternal
life
to
the
young
husband
who
is
here
plunged
in
sorrow
said
the
bishop
what
can
we
say
but
that
all
our
hearts
go
out
to
him
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
he
stood
on
this
spot
to
make
his
vows
before
heaven
and
before
men
to
love
and
cherish
the
dear
girl
who
has
been
so
suddenly
taken
away
if
she
had
lived
he
would
have
kept
his
promises
and
though
she
is
gone
he
will
preserve
the
spirit
of
them
still
the
pure
and
innocent
soul
who
linked
her
life
with
his
life
will
be
an
abiding
memory
a
perpetual
inspiration
against
sin
and
when
the
first
pangs
of
grief
are
over
a
constant
solace
and
a
lasting
joy
if
it
was
possible
for
oscar
to
look
more
wan
and
weak
than
when
he
went
into
the
cathedral
he
did
so
when
he
came
out
of
it
the
rain
was
now
falling
heavily
but
when
the
procession
was
formed
again
for
the
last
stage
of
the
journey
he
walked
bareheaded
as
before
the
factor
who
was
behind
oscar
with
helga
quivering
on
his
arm
begged
him
to
put
on
his
hat
but
he
refused
and
when
the
governor
who
came
next
with
anna
passed
up
an
umbrella
he
shook
his
head
and
sent
it
back
the
bell
tolled
again
the
little
town
sat
quiet
and
the
townspeople
who
wept
floods
of
tears
for
thora
wept
for
oscar
even
more
when
the
procession
reached
the
cemetery
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
and
even
the
priest
put
an
overcoat
over
his
cassock
but
oscar
stood
uncovered
by
the
open
grave
during
the
short
prayer
dust
to
dust
he
suffered
visibly
and
during
the
long
hymn
that
is
always
sung
at
an
icelandic
funeral
while
the
grave
is
being
filled
in
the
hollow
thuds
of
the
falling
earth
seemed
to
beat
upon
his
twitching
face
when
all
was
at
an
end
he
could
not
be
drawn
away
until
his
father
took
him
by
the
arm
and
said
in
a
firm
voice
come
then
with
a
stronger
step
he
walked
with
a
remnant
of
the
broken
procession
across
the
little
cemetery
the
hummocked
of
the
dead
through
the
gate
to
the
road
where
hans
the
in
the
sleeveless
waistcoat
thora
had
made
for
him
was
giving
water
to
her
horse
past
the
factor
s
house
where
aunt
margret
watched
at
a
window
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
thus
back
to
his
empty
home
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
excused
himself
when
the
mourners
went
in
to
their
meal
and
he
was
seen
no
more
that
day
the
dinner
was
a
cheerless
thing
being
served
in
the
room
that
had
witnessed
the
and
so
chilled
with
memories
of
that
happier
event
silently
or
in
whispers
the
mourners
bade
their
adieus
and
crept
away
one
by
one
leaving
the
few
remaining
members
of
the
two
families
with
wide
spaces
between
them
at
the
table
like
gaps
in
a
toothless
skull
the
governor
and
the
factor
had
not
spoken
since
their
return
from
the
proclamation
and
the
interval
of
silence
had
made
the
rift
between
the
two
old
friends
grow
wide
ah
well
yawned
the
factor
it
s
all
over
i
suppose
then
he
turned
to
the
governor
and
asked
sharply
where
is
magnus
i
ve
seen
nothing
of
him
the
governor
did
not
answer
and
anna
dropped
her
head
and
then
helga
who
was
the
only
other
person
present
said
quietly
somebody
saw
him
at
the
hotel
he
did
right
not
to
come
to
the
funeral
they
say
he
was
not
quite
sober
just
like
him
said
the
factor
a
yell
is
all
you
hear
of
a
wolf
and
but
for
his
last
drinking
bout
perhaps
nothing
of
this
would
have
happened
the
governor
s
proud
face
quivered
but
he
did
not
speak
and
soon
afterward
the
factor
and
helga
went
away
early
next
morning
before
the
household
was
astir
the
governor
was
in
his
bureau
ready
to
begin
on
the
arrears
of
business
when
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
magnus
white
and
worn
but
sober
and
serious
as
a
judge
may
i
speak
to
you
sir
said
magnus
well
perhaps
for
a
moment
come
in
said
the
governor
it
occurred
to
the
governor
as
magnus
entered
the
bureau
that
he
had
come
for
money
to
help
him
with
the
farm
and
he
said
immediately
if
you
have
come
for
financial
assistance
toward
stock
and
seed
and
what
not
i
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
magnus
that
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
i
have
already
spent
as
much
on
the
farm
as
i
am
justified
in
spending
more
perhaps
than
i
ought
to
have
spent
on
the
inheritance
of
one
of
my
sons
in
justice
to
the
claims
of
the
other
one
and
if
it
is
money
ready
money
i
do
not
come
to
ask
for
money
said
magnus
but
i
come
to
speak
about
it
he
added
and
then
he
sat
on
a
low
seat
and
twisted
his
felt
hat
between
his
knees
while
the
governor
leaned
back
in
his
and
fingered
a
pen
i
wish
to
ask
said
magnus
whether
you
drew
about
six
months
ago
a
bill
on
the
bank
of
denmark
for
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
the
governor
uttered
a
contemptuous
snort
and
said
certainly
not
i
have
never
drawn
a
bill
in
my
life
and
never
shall
do
so
why
do
you
ask
because
a
bill
for
that
amount
is
in
town
at
this
moment
said
magnus
then
it
is
a
forgery
an
impudent
forgery
and
the
forger
must
be
found
and
promptly
punished
the
governor
had
risen
in
his
chair
when
he
looked
at
magnus
s
drooping
head
and
a
thought
occurred
to
him
but
are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
is
this
story
true
he
asked
i
have
seen
the
paper
myself
replied
magnus
and
it
is
signed
in
my
name
it
is
signed
in
your
name
sir
and
witnessed
in
the
name
of
the
factor
that
too
said
the
governor
while
a
painful
smile
came
into
his
face
and
pray
whom
is
this
extraordinary
document
drawn
in
favor
of
magnus
did
not
reply
immediately
he
continued
to
twist
his
hat
between
his
knees
that
may
help
us
to
find
the
motive
and
therefore
the
forger
who
is
it
oscar
stephenson
said
magnus
oscar
your
brother
yes
sir
and
the
money
was
paid
to
him
in
paris
what
cried
the
governor
crossing
the
floor
you
tell
me
that
oscar
your
brother
oscar
has
committed
a
forgery
oh
that
s
what
you
mean
don
t
deny
it
you
mean
that
my
son
is
a
forger
magnus
made
no
answer
and
after
a
moment
the
painful
smile
about
the
governor
s
face
broke
into
a
more
painful
laugh
but
why
do
i
trouble
myself
with
such
a
trumpery
story
i
see
how
it
is
magnus
strong
drink
is
a
strong
tongue
you
have
been
drinking
i
have
been
drinking
sir
i
was
ill
and
i
couldn
t
help
it
but
i
m
sober
now
and
what
i
tell
you
is
god
s
truth
magnus
rose
as
he
said
this
and
father
and
son
stood
face
to
face
the
little
governor
in
his
uniform
with
flushed
cheeks
and
distended
and
magnus
big
black
clumsy
unkempt
and
with
lines
of
suffering
in
his
face
and
this
document
you
tell
me
is
at
present
in
iceland
it
is
sir
two
officers
of
the
law
brought
it
here
from
copenhagen
officers
of
the
law
you
say
the
bank
found
reasons
to
suspect
the
signatures
so
they
sent
across
to
verify
them
you
have
talked
with
these
men
yourself
no
doubt
the
sheriff
brought
them
to
see
me
said
magnus
the
sheriff
too
the
sheriff
of
all
men
he
is
to
bring
the
two
men
here
morning
so
he
is
to
bring
them
here
morning
the
governor
though
heated
and
agitated
laughed
once
more
and
said
with
a
sneer
of
course
in
the
interests
of
the
family
you
felt
it
necessary
to
examine
the
signatures
they
showed
you
i
did
said
magnus
simply
and
without
consulting
me
to
denounce
the
forger
magnus
made
no
reply
and
even
to
hint
only
to
hint
that
perhaps
you
could
point
to
the
forger
still
magnus
made
no
answer
and
dropping
his
cynical
tone
the
governor
burst
out
in
choking
anger
out
on
you
man
out
on
you
i
thought
you
were
drunk
or
suffering
from
the
delusions
of
drink
but
you
are
worse
you
are
sweltering
in
hatred
and
it
is
an
unnatural
hatred
too
the
hatred
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
magnus
flinched
as
if
a
lash
had
cut
him
through
the
skin
you
are
jealous
of
your
brother
always
have
been
always
will
be
because
he
is
clever
and
successful
and
amiable
and
because
everybody
loves
him
you
are
as
jealous
of
your
brother
as
cain
was
of
abel
and
this
is
your
way
of
destroying
him
magnus
stood
with
drooping
head
while
the
governor
s
lash
fell
over
him
aren
t
you
ashamed
to
stand
before
your
father
and
parade
the
whole
diabolical
catalogue
of
your
unnatural
passions
you
allow
yourself
to
consort
with
my
enemies
with
oscar
s
enemies
with
your
own
enemies
if
you
had
the
sense
to
see
it
while
they
try
to
bring
him
down
at
the
highest
moment
of
his
success
the
governor
was
walking
to
and
fro
and
lashing
himself
into
a
fury
at
the
deepest
moment
of
his
distress
too
just
when
the
poor
boy
is
unmanned
by
the
loss
of
his
wife
the
dear
girl
he
loved
and
you
insulted
but
i
don
t
believe
one
word
of
this
story
that
accursed
document
is
nothing
but
a
trick
to
dishonor
my
son
and
to
discredit
me
at
the
very
time
when
a
pack
of
rascals
who
call
themselves
reformers
are
trying
to
abolish
the
governorship
let
them
do
it
if
they
can
but
while
i
am
governor
here
i
m
master
in
this
house
and
sheriff
shall
be
suspended
and
those
men
sent
back
to
copenhagen
hadn
t
you
better
speak
to
oscar
first
sir
said
magnus
certainly
i
shall
and
if
i
find
as
i
expect
as
i
am
sure
that
your
story
is
a
pack
of
falsehoods
let
me
never
see
your
face
again
without
a
word
of
defense
or
explanation
magnus
left
the
room
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
oscar
at
the
call
of
the
governor
entered
it
oscar
s
face
was
as
pale
as
yesterday
but
with
a
different
pallor
a
different
expression
an
expression
not
of
grief
and
regret
but
of
fear
and
shame
oscar
said
the
governor
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
about
business
so
soon
after
your
great
sorrow
but
an
ugly
story
is
being
told
about
you
in
town
and
as
every
lie
has
its
tail
it
is
only
right
that
you
should
hear
of
this
one
immediately
so
that
it
may
be
quashed
without
delay
oscar
s
lower
lip
trembled
he
felt
the
blow
before
it
fell
magnus
your
brother
magnus
i
am
aware
he
has
not
been
on
brotherly
terms
with
you
your
mother
has
told
me
something
about
that
and
let
me
say
i
do
not
sympathize
with
his
protests
and
pretensions
i
think
them
nothing
but
an
excuse
for
his
own
selfishness
magnus
has
just
been
here
and
he
tells
me
that
a
note
of
hand
drawn
in
your
favor
for
no
less
a
sum
than
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
has
been
forged
in
my
name
i
do
not
believe
the
story
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
discuss
it
i
only
ask
you
to
contradict
it
to
contradict
it
flatly
or
to
leave
me
to
deal
with
the
real
offender
as
i
think
best
oscar
standing
by
the
governor
s
desk
remained
for
a
moment
quite
still
then
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
hardly
seemed
to
come
from
him
he
said
i
can
not
contradict
it
father
what
magnus
has
told
you
is
true
true
you
say
it
is
father
and
son
stood
facing
each
other
for
some
moments
without
a
word
more
being
spoken
then
in
hot
words
broken
by
breathless
pauses
the
governor
poured
out
question
after
question
to
which
oscar
made
no
answer
you
received
that
sum
and
signed
for
it
in
your
father
s
name
in
the
name
of
your
also
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
what
has
become
of
the
money
it
is
lost
said
oscar
lost
it
was
to
pay
the
debts
i
had
already
contracted
was
that
at
monte
carlo
yes
there
was
another
long
silence
in
which
oscar
stood
with
quivering
lips
and
the
governor
with
contracted
brows
but
this
document
how
did
it
come
about
i
ask
myself
that
question
over
and
over
again
father
and
i
fail
to
find
an
answer
i
can
not
understand
myself
i
try
and
i
can
not
were
you
mad
sometimes
i
think
i
was
i
must
have
been
did
somebody
tempt
you
put
the
idea
into
your
head
somebody
perhaps
who
helped
you
to
lose
and
promised
to
help
you
to
repay
if
so
who
was
it
i
do
not
wish
to
accuse
anybody
father
i
suppose
i
have
no
right
to
do
so
right
don
t
talk
to
me
about
rights
think
about
your
duties
and
the
first
of
your
duties
is
to
me
not
to
the
person
whoever
it
may
be
who
has
helped
to
destroy
you
you
have
pledged
my
credit
and
my
honor
but
i
don
t
want
to
think
you
altogether
bad
and
if
anybody
suggested
this
devilish
device
to
pay
your
debts
i
ought
to
be
told
who
it
was
was
it
helga
at
the
mention
of
that
name
oscar
s
drooping
head
drooped
lower
still
the
governor
saw
this
and
then
he
understood
everything
lord
god
forgive
us
he
said
in
a
breathless
whisper
then
magnus
was
right
after
all
and
the
death
of
the
poor
child
we
buried
yesterday
was
perhaps
a
part
of
the
diabolical
harvest
we
are
reaping
you
needn
t
wince
sir
i
see
it
s
true
without
that
oscar
did
not
attempt
to
excuse
himself
and
after
some
moments
of
silence
the
governor
spoke
again
you
have
deceived
and
disappointed
me
oscar
i
thought
i
had
one
son
who
was
an
intelligent
man
and
a
gentleman
not
a
forger
and
a
fool
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
prolong
a
painful
interview
you
may
go
oscar
staggered
out
of
the
room
and
the
governor
sank
into
his
chair
the
proud
man
was
abased
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
degraded
in
his
own
eyes
his
own
son
had
committed
a
vulgar
crime
and
exposed
himself
to
a
vulgar
punishment
in
the
first
pain
of
surprise
and
humiliation
he
saw
himself
covering
up
the
whole
wretched
episode
but
he
was
too
proud
to
be
proud
and
at
the
next
moment
he
began
to
count
with
his
conscience
thus
far
he
had
tried
to
do
what
was
right
in
iceland
and
he
would
do
what
was
right
to
the
end
whatever
it
might
cost
him
oscar
had
offended
against
the
law
and
he
must
bear
its
righteous
punishment
it
might
be
eight
years
imprisonment
with
the
ruin
of
all
his
prospects
the
waste
of
all
his
talents
and
the
wreck
of
all
his
happiness
but
he
must
go
through
with
it
to
the
last
hour
the
last
penalty
the
last
pang
so
felt
the
governor
as
judge
and
if
as
the
father
he
felt
differently
it
was
only
with
a
different
intensity
his
favorite
son
the
son
whom
he
had
indulged
and
pampered
in
the
past
for
whom
he
had
planned
and
prepared
so
many
things
in
the
future
had
committed
a
crime
against
his
country
and
against
himself
relying
upon
his
father
s
love
and
pride
to
save
him
from
the
painful
consequences
no
matter
what
sacrifice
it
might
cost
him
in
money
or
in
money
still
to
earn
no
matter
how
much
it
might
put
him
at
the
mercy
of
a
scheming
crew
who
were
striving
to
pull
him
from
his
place
it
was
selfish
it
was
heartless
it
was
shameful
it
was
infamous
and
it
deserved
a
double
punishment
feeling
more
bitterly
against
his
son
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
against
any
human
creature
the
governor
passed
the
day
in
torment
and
he
was
sitting
alone
in
his
room
late
at
night
with
no
light
but
the
sleepy
glow
from
the
open
stove
when
the
door
opened
noiselessly
and
anna
entered
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
although
her
eyes
were
dry
and
the
governor
reproached
himself
that
in
all
his
sorry
summary
of
the
consequences
of
his
son
s
crime
he
had
never
once
thought
of
his
son
s
mother
but
neither
did
she
think
of
herself
and
now
sitting
by
the
stove
and
stirring
it
she
began
to
talk
of
oscar
he
has
fallen
asleep
at
last
she
said
and
his
troubles
are
over
for
a
little
while
anyway
he
went
up
to
his
old
bedroom
stephen
the
one
he
slept
in
when
he
was
a
boy
when
magnus
and
he
were
boys
together
i
sat
with
him
until
he
dropped
off
and
he
held
my
hand
all
the
time
just
as
he
used
to
do
after
he
had
been
naughty
and
you
had
sent
him
to
bed
without
his
supper
he
looks
quite
like
himself
now
poor
boy
and
if
you
could
see
him
lying
there
on
the
pillow
you
would
think
the
old
days
had
come
back
when
you
used
to
go
up
with
the
candle
to
look
at
him
and
wipe
the
tears
from
his
little
face
while
he
lay
asleep
and
stroke
his
curly
hair
ah
dear
how
easily
he
could
throw
off
his
troubles
in
those
old
days
stephen
next
morning
you
would
hear
him
romping
about
overhead
and
singing
like
a
lark
a
shallow
nature
anna
said
the
governor
a
shallow
nature
on
which
nothing
makes
a
serious
impression
always
has
been
always
will
be
oh
but
this
will
stephen
this
will
make
a
deep
impression
and
if
the
poor
boy
could
only
have
another
chance
he
would
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
set
to
work
in
good
earnest
and
realize
all
your
expectations
and
then
think
only
think
father
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
if
one
brother
were
to
drag
the
other
into
the
dock
dreadful
for
us
i
mean
we
should
lose
both
our
children
for
oscar
would
be
lost
to
us
one
way
and
we
should
never
be
able
to
look
on
magnus
again
our
children
have
always
been
at
war
anna
ever
since
their
earliest
infancy
don
t
say
that
stephen
when
they
were
little
they
loved
each
other
dearly
it
was
not
until
they
grew
up
that
they
were
different
and
then
others
came
between
them
one
other
anyway
and
who
knows
perhaps
she
has
been
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
has
oscar
said
so
asked
the
governor
he
will
say
nothing
against
anybody
replied
anna
that
was
always
the
way
with
oscar
but
if
somebody
tempted
him
and
he
was
weak
and
if
our
poor
boy
must
go
to
prison
while
she
there
is
a
weakness
that
is
wickedness
anna
and
must
bear
its
pains
and
penalties
yes
i
know
said
anna
i
remember
you
said
the
same
words
long
ago
when
the
sailor
lad
killed
his
sweetheart
in
a
fit
of
drunken
passion
the
mother
was
a
widow
and
she
came
to
ask
me
to
plead
with
you
for
her
son
he
was
a
good
boy
she
said
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
drink
he
would
never
have
hurt
any
one
you
spared
his
life
you
know
and
he
was
sent
to
prison
and
dear
me
how
the
poor
woman
kissed
me
and
wept
on
my
face
for
joy
but
she
came
to
think
that
for
her
part
it
might
have
been
better
if
her
boy
had
died
instead
of
being
locked
up
for
ever
she
could
never
forget
it
and
when
her
eldest
daughter
was
married
and
her
house
was
full
of
people
and
everybody
was
happy
she
suddenly
remembered
and
ran
to
cry
and
then
on
wintry
nights
when
the
wind
was
moaning
over
the
sea
and
she
was
putting
the
little
boys
to
bed
she
always
thought
of
their
brother
lying
alone
in
the
big
brown
house
up
the
road
and
round
the
corner
it
wouldn
t
have
been
so
bad
if
he
had
been
sent
away
she
thought
and
she
was
only
a
poor
widow
who
washed
at
the
hot
springs
the
night
wind
was
moaning
over
the
sea
at
that
moment
and
the
governor
who
had
been
walking
to
and
fro
struggling
to
be
righteous
and
severe
was
feeling
a
pain
in
his
parched
throat
he
stood
for
some
moments
by
the
window
with
his
hands
interlaced
behind
him
looking
out
through
the
dark
pane
on
the
flying
moon
and
then
with
an
obvious
inward
effort
he
said
anna
if
i
acknowledge
this
signature
we
shall
have
nothing
left
nothing
but
my
salary
even
my
salary
is
threatened
and
if
it
goes
we
shall
be
without
anything
in
the
world
why
should
we
think
of
that
stephen
said
anna
we
had
nothing
when
we
married
and
yet
we
were
very
happy
it
is
true
we
were
young
then
and
now
we
are
old
but
if
poverty
comes
again
we
shall
know
better
how
to
bear
it
and
if
we
have
nothing
else
we
will
have
each
other
and
our
boys
too
both
our
boys
wherever
they
may
be
by
that
time
and
neither
of
them
will
love
us
the
less
because
we
have
given
up
everything
everything
we
had
in
the
world
that
they
might
still
be
honored
and
respected
the
clock
struck
twelve
in
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
with
a
reverberant
ring
that
passed
over
the
sleepy
town
and
the
governor
stopped
in
his
restless
perambulation
it
is
late
mother
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
let
us
go
to
bed
next
morning
the
governor
was
in
his
bureau
again
he
was
now
firm
and
composed
and
waiting
calmly
for
the
officers
from
copenhagen
they
came
early
headed
by
the
sheriff
and
bore
themselves
largely
like
men
who
were
conscious
that
they
were
about
to
administer
a
painful
shock
after
the
formal
introductions
the
sheriff
leaned
above
the
governor
s
desk
and
said
suavely
almost
condescendingly
these
gentlemen
have
been
anxious
to
show
every
consideration
they
came
on
an
urgent
matter
i
may
say
a
most
urgent
matter
but
they
have
waited
five
days
rather
than
break
in
upon
you
at
a
time
of
domestic
tribulation
i
am
busy
this
morning
sheriff
said
the
governor
be
so
good
as
to
waste
no
more
time
than
is
necessary
the
sheriff
gasped
and
fell
back
from
the
desk
whereupon
the
strangers
stepped
up
to
it
and
one
of
them
opening
a
large
envelope
said
in
a
tone
of
indulgent
courtesy
we
have
a
document
here
your
excellency
which
claims
to
be
drawn
by
your
authority
will
you
be
good
enough
to
see
if
this
is
your
excellency
s
signature
the
governor
fixed
his
leisurely
and
glancing
hastily
almost
casually
at
the
paper
put
before
him
replied
promptly
it
is
the
strangers
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
before
they
spoke
again
in
that
case
we
presume
your
excellency
will
be
prepared
to
honor
it
certainly
said
the
governor
then
your
excellency
will
be
aware
that
the
bill
is
already
overdue
and
that
two
applications
have
been
made
for
payment
the
governor
flinched
at
that
question
but
recovering
himself
in
a
moment
he
said
shortly
the
bill
shall
be
met
immediately
how
soon
your
excellency
a
week
a
fortnight
three
days
said
the
governor
gentlemen
and
without
more
ceremony
he
took
up
his
pen
and
began
to
write
a
letter
the
sheriff
who
was
perspiring
visibly
by
this
time
had
edged
round
to
the
door
and
after
a
short
silence
in
which
nothing
was
heard
but
the
scratching
of
the
governor
s
quill
the
strangers
bowed
to
his
stooping
forehead
and
backed
themselves
out
of
the
room
the
governor
s
letter
was
to
the
factor
asking
him
to
come
immediately
he
came
looking
sullen
and
suspicious
with
the
air
of
one
who
knew
something
already
of
the
business
for
which
he
had
been
summoned
old
friend
said
the
governor
we
have
known
each
other
for
fifty
years
and
i
have
never
yet
asked
you
to
do
me
a
favor
but
i
am
going
to
ask
you
now
h
m
said
the
factor
with
a
cold
smile
it
is
not
for
my
own
needs
i
ask
it
but
for
one
who
is
nearer
to
me
than
myself
we
who
are
fathers
know
what
that
means
and
we
also
know
that
a
favor
done
once
to
our
children
is
done
twice
to
ourselves
h
m
h
m
said
the
factor
with
the
same
cold
smile
it
is
a
private
matter
strictly
private
but
to
you
old
friend
i
can
reveal
the
secret
your
godson
has
got
himself
into
trouble
and
then
excusing
and
extenuating
nothing
the
governor
told
the
story
of
oscar
s
downfall
and
the
factor
listened
with
the
impatience
of
one
who
had
heard
the
sorry
tale
before
he
signed
my
name
also
you
say
said
the
factor
that
too
unhappily
answered
the
governor
but
you
were
merely
made
witness
to
the
deed
and
i
am
responsible
for
the
money
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
asked
the
factor
in
a
hard
tone
pay
it
and
give
the
lad
another
chance
in
life
replied
the
governor
and
that
s
why
i
sent
for
you
this
morning
i
can
find
fifty
thousand
crowns
and
i
want
you
to
lend
me
the
other
fifty
thousand
not
fifty
thousand
cents
said
the
factor
not
fifty
to
shield
a
criminal
and
to
cheat
the
law
the
governor
s
face
whitened
but
he
answered
quietly
don
t
speak
so
fast
old
friend
remember
that
the
offense
against
the
law
is
only
an
offense
against
myself
and
if
i
choose
to
forgive
it
the
law
can
have
nothing
to
say
what
about
the
offense
against
me
said
the
factor
remember
too
continued
the
governor
that
if
oscar
has
made
free
with
your
name
he
has
certain
claims
upon
your
purse
there
is
the
marriage
contract
the
marriage
contract
was
made
for
thora
and
thora
is
dead
said
the
factor
there
is
the
child
said
the
governor
i
hold
the
child
now
and
i
am
prepared
to
provide
for
it
in
the
future
said
the
factor
but
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
a
man
who
has
forged
my
name
and
if
any
further
claim
is
made
on
my
business
or
estate
or
what
not
i
will
protest
against
it
and
publish
my
reasons
for
doing
so
oscar
neilsen
said
the
governor
there
is
something
i
have
not
told
you
something
i
did
not
intend
to
tell
you
but
i
must
tell
it
to
you
now
i
have
reason
to
believe
to
be
confident
that
for
the
trouble
in
which
oscar
finds
himself
helga
is
partly
responsible
can
you
prove
that
stephen
magnusson
said
the
factor
if
i
can
not
prove
it
replied
the
governor
it
is
because
my
son
whatever
his
faults
and
follies
is
still
a
gentleman
and
if
you
do
not
know
it
by
this
time
it
is
because
your
daughter
is
not
a
lady
speak
for
your
own
stephen
magnusson
and
leave
mine
to
me
said
the
factor
therefore
continued
the
governor
when
i
pay
this
money
and
i
shall
pay
it
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
to
know
that
though
i
am
a
poor
man
and
you
are
a
rich
one
i
am
discharging
your
debt
as
well
as
mine
with
that
red
and
angry
the
governor
walked
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
factor
looked
at
him
in
blank
amazement
and
for
one
swift
instant
his
better
nature
conquered
his
greed
and
he
saw
what
a
pitiful
thing
it
was
that
after
fifty
years
of
friendship
they
should
quarrel
thus
about
their
children
but
one
sword
draws
another
from
its
sheath
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
contemptuously
and
strode
out
of
the
room
then
the
governor
sent
for
the
manager
of
the
bank
of
iceland
manager
he
said
i
wish
you
to
arrange
a
loan
of
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
on
the
security
of
my
farm
at
thingvellir
the
farm
is
hardly
worth
so
much
sir
i
say
it
is
hardly
worth
so
much
said
the
manager
but
in
your
case
there
can
be
little
difficulty
none
whatever
if
you
are
willing
to
pay
the
higher
interest
i
say
none
whatever
if
you
are
willing
to
pay
the
higher
interest
i
agree
said
the
governor
and
let
the
deed
be
drawn
without
delay
having
gone
through
the
material
part
of
his
preparations
the
governor
had
now
a
spiritual
and
more
trying
ordeal
before
him
and
he
went
out
into
the
to
think
over
it
leaving
the
town
behind
he
walked
with
hands
as
usual
interlaced
behind
him
as
far
as
to
the
margin
of
the
fiord
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
the
light
was
wonderful
a
silvery
light
that
made
the
light
of
other
days
seem
dull
and
leaden
full
of
innumerable
sparkles
like
the
stars
that
are
sown
in
snow
the
waters
of
the
fiord
were
heaving
slowly
under
a
quivering
haze
and
on
the
sea
outside
wide
vast
stretching
far
away
a
number
of
with
their
white
sails
bellied
to
a
breeze
that
could
not
be
felt
on
shore
were
going
on
and
on
as
if
sailing
into
the
sky
the
was
lying
at
anchor
in
the
bay
getting
up
steam
for
her
voyage
back
to
england
and
a
flock
of
lighters
painted
white
were
floating
about
her
black
hull
like
at
the
foot
of
a
lava
rock
the
gulls
were
calling
high
up
in
the
air
and
from
the
sheltered
side
of
a
little
island
the
last
of
the
year
s
were
coaxing
or
driving
their
young
ones
into
the
sea
to
prepare
them
for
their
flight
to
lands
it
was
a
cruelly
beautiful
morning
one
of
those
radiant
days
when
nature
in
her
indifference
to
man
and
his
sufferings
seems
to
conjure
up
every
joyous
sound
and
sight
that
can
trouble
the
bitterest
waters
of
memory
when
the
very
sunshine
seems
to
break
one
s
heart
at
length
the
proud
man
who
was
walking
through
the
hummocked
with
head
bent
low
by
the
sorrow
of
a
wrecked
and
shattered
hope
saw
plainly
what
he
had
to
do
in
love
no
less
than
anger
in
justice
no
less
than
duty
he
had
to
cast
off
forever
his
favorite
son
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
the
hope
of
his
life
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
the
house
he
sent
for
oscar
after
some
moments
oscar
came
down
slowly
looking
more
ill
and
weak
than
ever
and
stood
by
the
stove
with
drooping
head
like
a
prisoner
about
to
receive
his
sentence
the
governor
glanced
up
at
his
son
from
over
the
rims
of
his
and
at
first
his
heart
failed
him
but
after
a
moment
he
steeled
himself
to
his
task
and
began
to
speak
in
a
steady
voice
i
have
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
he
said
that
for
your
mother
s
sake
i
prefer
to
put
it
so
i
have
acknowledged
that
signature
and
am
preparing
to
pay
the
money
you
have
wasted
to
do
so
i
am
compelled
to
mortgage
every
pennyworth
of
property
we
possess
so
that
apart
from
my
official
salary
i
shall
soon
have
nothing
worse
than
that
i
have
had
to
eat
up
your
brother
s
inheritance
in
order
to
purchase
your
liberty
and
whether
i
had
a
right
to
do
so
god
alone
can
say
oscar
shivered
as
from
cold
the
governor
saw
this
waited
a
moment
and
then
went
on
the
condition
on
which
i
make
this
sacrifice
is
that
you
leave
iceland
immediately
you
will
sail
by
the
laura
which
goes
back
this
evening
and
as
your
honor
is
my
honor
i
will
give
it
out
that
your
health
is
broken
after
the
death
of
your
wife
and
that
you
have
gone
away
to
recruit
the
governor
paused
a
second
time
and
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
thick
and
hoarse
i
shall
not
expect
you
to
come
back
soon
i
shall
not
expect
you
to
come
back
at
all
inasmuch
as
you
have
done
your
best
or
worst
to
wreck
my
happiness
i
will
ask
you
to
consider
that
henceforth
our
lives
are
to
run
in
different
courses
and
that
for
my
own
part
i
wish
to
see
you
no
more
the
governor
s
voice
was
now
husky
and
indistinct
but
still
he
struggled
on
you
will
look
to
yourself
for
your
livelihood
in
the
future
but
that
with
your
talents
little
as
you
have
made
of
them
hitherto
should
not
be
difficult
whatever
happens
here
i
shall
never
expect
you
to
do
anything
for
me
or
for
your
mother
but
if
fortune
should
favor
you
and
you
are
able
to
repay
your
brother
your
conscience
may
be
the
easier
and
though
i
do
not
pity
him
for
his
heart
was
hard
the
earth
on
my
grave
the
lighter
the
governor
paused
for
the
last
time
cleared
his
throat
and
then
said
in
a
firmer
tone
only
one
word
more
i
thought
perhaps
your
might
have
done
something
for
you
but
apart
from
a
promise
to
provide
for
the
child
he
will
do
nothing
therefore
as
i
have
reason
to
fear
that
his
daughter
helga
was
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
which
has
so
nearly
wrecked
us
all
and
perhaps
a
first
cause
of
the
death
of
our
dear
thora
i
will
ask
you
to
promise
me
for
your
own
sake
more
than
mine
to
hold
no
further
intercourse
with
him
or
his
do
you
promise
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
and
then
a
muffled
sob
came
as
from
the
stove
itself
i
promise
after
that
there
was
silence
again
for
a
perceptible
period
and
then
a
voice
a
strange
voice
that
was
like
a
cry
said
that
is
all
and
now
and
and
god
help
you
choking
with
emotion
and
blind
with
tears
oscar
turned
about
to
acknowledge
the
justice
of
his
punishment
to
say
that
he
deserved
everything
everything
and
more
a
more
but
he
found
himself
alone
his
father
had
fled
from
the
room
when
magnus
heard
of
what
his
father
had
done
his
wrath
knew
no
measure
on
the
day
when
he
found
thora
dead
in
her
bed
he
had
said
to
himself
oscar
has
done
this
and
he
must
be
made
to
suffer
but
there
was
no
legal
way
to
punish
a
man
who
had
tortured
his
wife
to
death
by
every
refinement
of
hypocrisy
and
pretense
and
it
was
at
the
height
of
his
anger
that
the
offense
against
his
father
s
property
had
come
to
him
with
its
diabolical
temptation
use
me
it
whispered
the
damnable
spirit
of
the
world
understands
me
better
and
after
a
struggle
in
which
the
devils
seemed
to
fight
for
his
soul
he
yielded
he
thought
he
knew
the
price
he
would
have
to
pay
and
that
was
the
reason
he
did
not
join
his
family
at
the
funeral
everybody
would
loathe
him
for
giving
up
his
brother
to
the
punishment
he
deserved
his
own
mother
would
turn
from
him
and
after
his
father
being
confronted
by
poverty
had
allowed
the
law
to
take
its
course
he
would
hate
and
despise
the
son
who
had
saved
him
from
beggary
but
no
matter
when
he
stood
up
in
court
and
said
this
is
oscar
stephenson
s
handwriting
for
he
is
a
forger
and
a
thief
and
a
thrill
of
horror
ran
through
the
crowded
room
and
every
eye
turned
on
him
with
contempt
he
would
say
to
his
secret
heart
he
killed
her
and
he
had
to
suffer
and
there
was
no
other
way
than
this
yet
that
was
not
what
had
happened
his
father
had
saved
oscar
from
the
just
punishment
of
his
infamous
offense
and
how
had
he
saved
him
by
making
him
magnus
pay
the
price
of
oscar
s
riotous
living
abroad
thus
the
vengeance
which
he
had
vowed
upon
his
brother
had
recoiled
upon
himself
and
while
his
rightful
inheritance
was
wiped
out
while
the
farm
on
which
he
had
built
his
last
hopes
was
embarrassed
beyond
the
possibility
of
redemption
and
he
was
ruined
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
man
for
whom
and
by
whom
he
was
ruined
ruined
in
his
affections
as
well
as
his
fortunes
was
to
be
allowed
to
steal
away
amid
a
croaking
chorus
of
sympathy
and
pity
under
the
cloak
of
broken
health
and
a
broken
heart
what
a
devil
s
world
it
was
in
which
infamy
could
masquerade
as
honor
and
hypocrisy
as
grief
when
magnus
thought
in
this
way
his
eyesight
grew
dull
and
his
hearing
dense
and
he
felt
a
cold
pain
at
the
back
of
his
neck
then
he
began
to
use
again
the
only
remedy
he
had
recourse
to
when
his
head
was
bad
he
began
to
drink
but
sitting
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
of
the
hotel
every
word
he
heard
every
conversation
that
filtered
through
the
smoke
and
noise
and
his
deadened
senses
seemed
to
stimulate
the
idea
which
had
taken
possession
of
him
it
was
the
devil
s
own
world
and
god
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
at
one
moment
a
student
ran
into
the
room
and
shouted
above
the
laughter
and
singing
of
his
boys
what
do
you
think
oscar
stephenson
is
sailing
by
the
laura
and
thereupon
a
babel
of
voices
cried
really
never
you
don
t
say
so
true
enough
smashed
up
for
good
and
going
abroad
for
an
indefinite
period
not
a
bit
of
it
oscar
isn
t
the
sort
to
be
broken
up
like
that
six
months
abroad
and
he
ll
be
home
again
as
bright
and
fresh
as
ever
so
he
will
thought
magnus
but
his
heart
was
fierce
and
bitter
at
another
moment
the
chairman
of
the
town
board
came
in
panting
and
cried
news
gentlemen
news
oscar
stephenson
has
resigned
his
seat
in
parliament
impossible
listen
and
the
little
fat
man
read
out
of
his
rasping
asthmatical
throat
from
a
sheet
smelling
of
damp
paper
and
printer
s
ink
a
letter
from
oscar
to
his
constituents
broken
in
health
and
happiness
compelled
to
go
abroad
impossible
to
fix
date
of
return
consequently
forced
to
tender
resignation
deeply
grieved
and
disappointed
but
set
the
duties
too
high
to
ask
his
constituents
to
wait
that
means
he
s
not
coming
back
but
good
heavens
does
he
know
what
he
s
giving
up
why
there
s
nothing
that
s
not
within
the
man
s
reach
absolutely
nothing
i
wonder
the
governor
has
allowed
him
to
do
it
and
then
magnus
laughed
out
loud
in
the
fierce
bitterness
of
his
heart
after
that
the
voices
were
lower
for
a
little
while
and
when
magnus
heard
them
again
somebody
was
saying
but
a
man
can
love
a
woman
too
much
altogether
breaking
your
life
to
pieces
because
you
ve
lost
your
wife
isn
t
brave
it
isn
t
manly
perhaps
not
but
it
s
human
said
somebody
else
and
if
oscar
stephenson
is
smashed
up
by
the
death
of
thora
neilsen
he
s
in
the
right
of
it
i
say
so
do
i
cried
magnus
and
laughing
wildly
he
dropped
his
head
over
his
arms
on
the
table
what
a
devil
s
own
world
it
was
to
be
sure
there
was
some
whispering
and
then
two
louder
voices
poor
fellow
so
unlike
his
brother
going
it
fast
they
say
his
father
was
pretty
hard
on
him
though
not
harder
than
he
deserved
poor
devil
the
poison
in
the
soul
of
magnus
was
fermenting
every
moment
hearing
the
contemptuous
pity
with
which
he
was
contrasted
with
his
brother
his
brother
who
had
wrought
all
the
evil
his
temples
beat
furiously
and
one
wild
thought
expelled
all
other
thoughts
from
his
brain
if
there
was
no
law
to
punish
oscar
if
his
father
had
conspired
to
help
oscar
to
escape
and
if
the
hypocritical
community
agreed
to
cover
up
his
fault
one
thing
at
least
remained
before
oscar
left
iceland
he
must
meet
with
him
then
if
this
was
the
devil
s
own
world
let
the
devil
look
after
his
elect
magnus
s
mind
was
weltering
in
this
thought
as
in
a
boiling
sulphur
pit
when
the
captain
of
the
laura
came
into
the
with
the
agent
of
the
steamship
company
and
seating
themselves
near
to
him
began
to
converse
apart
then
he
will
have
to
put
up
with
a
bed
in
the
hold
for
all
the
berths
are
gone
said
the
captain
but
why
can
t
he
wait
for
the
next
steamer
i
ll
tell
you
why
whispered
the
agent
because
the
factor
s
daughter
is
to
sail
by
the
vesta
and
there
seem
to
be
reasons
why
they
should
not
meet
so
that
s
it
is
it
but
their
fathers
are
fools
not
to
know
that
they
ll
meet
on
the
other
side
if
they
want
to
overhearing
this
conversation
magnus
lifted
his
head
from
his
arms
drank
a
large
tumbler
of
brandy
and
water
to
the
last
drop
and
walked
heavily
out
of
the
house
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
the
passing
of
time
but
the
darkness
was
now
closing
in
porters
were
hurrying
with
luggage
toward
the
pier
and
the
first
of
the
laura
s
three
bells
was
ringing
magnus
was
like
a
man
who
could
not
see
or
hear
properly
more
than
once
he
collided
with
people
on
the
parapet
and
being
big
and
strong
he
brushed
them
out
of
the
way
some
of
them
cursed
him
but
he
did
not
stop
his
clouded
faculties
were
conscious
of
one
idea
only
that
he
must
go
to
government
house
and
meet
oscar
face
to
face
before
he
sailed
reaching
his
former
home
he
found
the
door
open
as
usual
on
an
autumn
evening
and
nobody
in
porch
or
hall
avoiding
his
father
s
door
he
walked
and
turned
mechanically
toward
the
apartments
which
had
lately
been
occupied
by
oscar
but
that
was
a
part
of
the
house
sacred
to
his
memory
of
thora
and
even
in
this
hour
of
passion
and
pain
something
whispered
to
his
tortured
conscience
and
he
turned
away
a
moment
later
he
was
in
oscar
s
bedroom
on
the
upper
floor
the
furniture
was
in
disorder
the
carpet
was
awry
and
articles
of
apparel
were
scattered
about
as
if
somebody
had
been
packing
trunks
but
the
trunks
were
gone
and
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
magnus
was
about
to
go
when
his
eyes
were
arrested
by
papers
on
a
desk
among
sheets
of
music
and
scraps
from
newspapers
there
were
the
remains
of
a
letter
doubled
up
and
torn
across
magnus
knew
the
handwriting
it
was
helga
s
and
without
any
compunction
he
put
the
pieces
together
and
read
the
letter
oscar
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
the
governor
had
spoken
to
you
on
the
fatal
subject
i
confessed
everything
to
my
father
and
took
my
own
share
of
the
transaction
of
course
he
was
furious
and
now
he
vows
that
i
must
go
back
immediately
to
my
mother
in
copenhagen
that
does
not
trouble
me
seeing
that
you
are
leaving
iceland
but
i
must
see
you
before
you
go
in
spite
of
all
you
say
and
notwithstanding
any
promise
you
may
have
given
to
anybody
it
is
impossible
that
we
can
part
like
this
it
would
be
too
selfish
and
too
cowardly
not
to
give
me
the
chance
of
seeing
you
for
the
last
time
your
steamer
sails
at
nine
o
clock
come
to
me
at
eight
if
you
do
not
come
i
may
even
follow
you
to
london
i
do
so
if
magnus
read
no
more
but
ramming
the
pieces
into
his
pocket
he
plunged
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
if
anybody
could
have
seen
him
at
that
moment
his
appearance
must
have
seemed
terrible
for
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
the
veins
on
his
forehead
were
swollen
and
dark
it
was
now
night
and
the
second
bell
was
ringing
in
the
bay
he
was
lunging
along
in
the
direction
of
the
factor
s
when
somebody
crossed
in
front
of
him
in
the
thoroughfare
it
was
oscar
himself
and
he
was
going
in
another
direction
magnus
was
like
a
man
whose
reason
is
clogged
but
he
saw
everything
in
the
light
of
his
own
making
his
brother
was
returning
from
the
pier
after
taking
his
baggage
aboard
and
he
had
come
ashore
on
a
last
errand
magnus
knew
what
errand
that
was
it
was
to
see
helga
and
they
were
going
to
meet
where
they
could
be
unobserved
the
moon
had
risen
by
this
time
and
magnus
could
keep
his
brother
in
view
while
he
followed
like
a
hound
behind
him
he
saw
nothing
else
and
was
not
even
conscious
of
what
streets
they
passed
through
save
that
they
were
going
toward
the
upper
part
of
the
town
near
to
the
lake
and
down
the
road
that
runs
beside
it
he
tried
to
walk
softly
and
to
make
no
noise
but
sometimes
a
hard
laugh
broke
from
his
dry
throat
and
once
or
twice
a
great
sob
came
behind
it
he
was
thinking
of
thora
and
telling
himself
what
he
would
say
when
oscar
met
helga
and
he
came
face
to
face
with
them
he
would
say
i
loved
your
wife
i
m
not
ashamed
to
say
so
i
loved
her
and
gave
her
up
to
you
and
you
promised
to
cherish
her
but
you
neglected
her
and
allowed
her
child
to
be
stolen
away
i
would
have
given
my
heart
s
blood
to
make
her
happy
but
you
made
her
miserable
and
now
she
is
dead
and
you
are
here
with
this
woman
who
helped
to
torture
her
you
are
a
perjurer
and
a
forger
and
a
scoundrel
and
you
may
take
that
and
that
and
that
and
carry
the
mark
of
my
hand
on
your
face
when
you
go
where
this
wanton
means
to
follow
you
he
was
now
outside
the
town
but
he
could
not
see
or
hear
or
think
like
a
christian
man
and
was
merely
ranging
along
the
road
like
a
beast
then
all
at
once
in
the
still
air
and
the
silence
of
all
around
him
he
heard
the
voice
of
some
one
who
was
saying
in
low
quivering
pleading
tones
my
darling
my
darling
magnus
knew
whose
voice
it
was
he
thought
he
also
knew
what
sight
he
should
see
a
moment
later
it
would
be
oscar
and
helga
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
as
they
had
been
when
he
saw
them
last
in
the
dance
at
the
farm
flushed
hot
and
excited
with
his
fists
clinched
and
his
teeth
set
hard
he
plunged
through
a
gate
that
was
like
the
gate
to
a
garden
and
then
ran
forward
a
few
paces
but
he
drew
up
suddenly
as
if
an
unseen
hand
had
seized
his
arm
he
saw
where
he
was
and
his
breath
seemed
to
leave
him
he
was
in
the
cemetery
and
some
twenty
yards
farther
down
the
path
his
brother
oscar
was
kneeling
by
the
side
of
a
grave
and
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
magnus
stumbled
back
to
the
road
sobered
ashamed
and
broken
into
utter
helplessness
it
might
be
the
devil
s
own
world
but
god
was
in
it
also
when
the
last
of
the
laura
s
three
bells
were
ringing
magnus
stood
alone
on
the
little
wooden
jetty
going
down
to
the
bay
the
whistle
screamed
in
the
the
rattled
in
the
and
the
steamer
turned
her
head
to
the
sea
then
a
came
back
from
the
vessel
s
side
bringing
an
elderly
lady
who
was
trying
to
hide
her
face
from
the
gaze
of
the
boatmen
and
even
the
eyes
of
the
night
behind
the
folds
of
a
little
lace
shawl
which
she
wore
over
her
hufa
it
was
anna
and
as
magnus
helped
her
ashore
she
said
give
me
your
arm
and
take
me
home
i
m
not
feeling
well
magnus
but
before
they
had
gone
many
paces
she
stopped
and
looked
back
lovingly
at
the
ship
that
was
now
steaming
down
the
fiord
and
said
in
a
pitiful
voice
he
is
gone
and
i
have
lost
him
my
poor
boy
my
poor
oscar
i
had
him
for
six
and
twenty
years
and
to
think
it
should
come
to
this
she
walked
a
few
more
paces
and
then
looked
back
again
and
said
i
have
never
seen
anybody
so
deeply
affected
oh
mother
mother
he
cried
at
last
just
like
a
child
i
could
have
fancied
the
years
had
rolled
back
and
he
was
still
a
boy
feeling
ill
and
helpless
and
wanting
to
lie
in
his
mother
s
lap
again
she
walked
a
few
steps
and
looked
back
as
before
there
was
nobody
to
see
him
off
nobody
at
all
the
story
must
have
leaked
out
somewhere
and
of
all
the
people
he
used
to
call
his
friends
there
was
not
one
to
say
farewell
my
poor
boy
my
poor
oscar
he
did
wrong
very
wrong
but
god
knows
how
he
is
suffering
we
think
we
punish
people
when
we
put
them
in
prison
but
what
punishment
is
like
the
pain
of
an
awakened
conscience
and
oscar
is
leaving
everything
behind
him
everything
and
everybody
and
going
away
in
disgrace
once
more
she
walked
a
few
steps
and
then
she
said
in
the
voice
of
a
crying
child
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
pretended
i
should
but
i
know
quite
well
i
shall
not
some
day
you
will
come
back
i
said
and
make
amends
and
wipe
out
and
he
said
yes
and
yes
but
we
both
knew
well
it
wasn
t
true
when
the
bell
rang
and
i
had
to
come
away
he
said
mother
you
ve
been
the
best
mother
a
man
ever
had
and
i
knew
it
was
the
last
word
i
shall
ever
hear
from
him
after
that
she
could
not
speak
for
some
minutes
and
then
she
said
as
if
trying
to
comfort
herself
perhaps
god
will
give
my
boy
another
chance
where
he
is
going
to
if
so
i
think
he
will
do
better
but
if
not
she
could
not
finish
what
she
intended
to
say
that
god
s
mercy
was
more
terrible
than
the
vengeance
of
man
and
he
who
renounced
it
would
surely
be
destroyed
they
walked
on
in
silence
until
they
came
to
the
gate
of
government
house
and
then
anna
took
her
last
look
at
the
dark
ship
that
was
dying
away
to
an
indistinguishable
mass
in
the
shades
of
night
and
the
mists
of
her
blinding
tears
and
said
in
a
brave
voice
we
must
be
very
good
to
each
other
in
future
magnus
you
are
the
only
son
left
to
me
now
and
if
you
have
to
suffer
for
the
sin
of
somebody
else
you
must
let
me
help
you
to
bear
it
i
will
always
do
so
as
long
as
i
live
magnus
and
when
i
am
gone
from
you
god
will
not
forget
magnus
and
god
bless
you
magnus
stood
for
some
time
where
his
mother
had
left
him
for
the
breakers
of
passion
were
still
surging
in
his
throat
then
he
returned
to
the
jetty
and
dropped
the
remains
of
helga
s
letter
into
the
sea
and
they
went
out
with
the
ebbing
tide
indeed
repentance
oft
swore
but
was
i
sober
when
i
swore
then
and
then
came
spring
and
threadbare
penitence
apieces
above
all
other
cities
of
the
world
london
is
the
home
of
the
outcast
the
refuge
of
the
disgraced
and
rejected
the
asylum
of
the
moral
leper
the
grave
of
the
moral
suicide
she
offers
him
obscurity
and
a
kind
of
cleansing
if
he
will
cast
himself
into
the
rolling
billows
of
her
six
millions
of
people
and
she
keeps
her
word
but
exacts
her
penalties
her
penalties
are
homelessness
friendlessness
and
loneliness
but
above
all
loneliness
there
is
no
loneliness
like
that
of
london
the
loneliness
of
an
open
boat
on
an
open
sea
in
an
impenetrable
fog
or
the
loneliness
of
a
trackless
heath
in
a
blinding
snowstorm
is
not
so
desolating
to
the
human
soul
as
the
loneliness
of
london
s
crowded
thoroughfares
with
their
lines
of
unknown
faces
filing
on
and
on
within
a
year
oscar
stephenson
knew
the
loneliness
of
london
to
its
last
pang
its
utmost
bitterness
when
he
parted
from
his
mother
on
the
deck
of
the
laura
she
slipped
a
purse
into
his
pocket
just
as
she
used
to
do
when
he
was
a
boy
going
to
college
or
going
away
for
his
holiday
the
purse
contained
gold
and
notes
to
the
value
of
fifty
pounds
and
this
with
the
little
he
had
of
his
own
was
the
whole
sum
of
his
fortune
and
all
he
had
to
face
the
future
with
he
was
not
so
young
as
to
think
it
inexhaustible
or
so
sanguine
as
to
expect
the
world
to
fall
at
the
feet
of
a
fallen
man
so
he
tried
to
be
frugal
and
to
spend
his
substance
prudently
he
spent
his
first
night
in
london
at
the
hotel
in
trafalgar
square
at
which
he
had
stayed
with
thora
and
helga
on
their
way
to
italy
but
besides
being
too
expensive
for
his
present
means
the
place
was
too
full
of
tragic
memories
and
next
day
he
removed
to
a
house
in
one
of
the
first
of
the
side
streets
going
down
to
the
river
from
the
strand
his
lodging
was
a
single
room
on
an
upper
floor
having
a
stuffy
odor
of
carpets
and
curtains
and
a
prospect
of
the
neighboring
roofs
with
various
causeways
of
red
in
this
apartment
oscar
stephenson
had
his
first
experience
of
the
loneliness
of
london
he
lived
there
six
months
without
seeing
any
face
belonging
to
the
house
except
the
face
of
his
landlady
and
without
knowing
more
about
his
than
that
his
neighbor
in
the
adjoining
room
never
returned
home
at
night
until
after
the
great
clock
at
westminster
had
struck
twelve
and
that
he
whistled
onward
christian
soldiers
in
varying
degrees
of
alcoholic
uncertainty
while
he
put
himself
to
bed
before
the
end
of
those
six
months
oscar
was
in
debt
to
his
landlady
he
had
no
regular
employment
and
no
prospect
except
the
imminent
one
of
being
homeless
and
penniless
by
what
stages
of
quick
descent
he
came
down
to
this
condition
it
would
be
a
needless
task
to
tell
his
story
is
that
of
the
great
army
of
the
disgraced
and
the
castaway
who
fly
to
london
as
to
a
sanctuary
and
are
allowed
to
live
only
by
lying
at
its
doors
he
had
struggled
and
failed
he
was
young
and
active
but
nobody
needed
him
in
some
places
his
want
of
references
was
a
difficulty
in
others
his
superior
education
was
a
cause
of
suspicion
he
was
too
good
for
one
post
and
not
good
enough
for
another
in
a
world
full
of
work
there
was
no
work
for
him
to
do
the
slow
agony
of
those
first
six
months
kept
alive
the
shame
and
misery
of
his
breakdown
and
nearly
sapped
his
moral
courage
as
day
followed
day
and
the
feeling
of
uselessness
deepened
he
felt
like
a
boy
a
friendless
abandoned
boy
he
had
done
wrong
and
he
was
ready
to
bear
his
punishment
but
the
great
irresistible
unanswerable
world
was
using
him
cruelly
it
would
not
make
peace
with
him
on
any
terms
it
was
leaving
him
without
hope
or
counsel
or
encouragement
or
consolation
it
was
leaving
him
alone
this
sense
of
being
of
no
account
of
being
nothing
and
nobody
in
the
world
with
the
terror
of
sinking
out
of
sight
some
day
and
nobody
knowing
or
caring
was
harder
to
bear
than
poverty
or
even
shame
itself
when
the
clouds
looked
blackest
he
swallowed
the
last
remnant
of
his
pride
and
appealed
to
the
few
friends
of
his
father
in
england
who
had
been
so
good
to
him
in
the
careless
days
of
his
college
life
and
so
boundlessly
hospitable
in
the
happy
time
of
his
honeymoon
he
appealed
to
the
professor
at
oxford
making
a
clean
breast
of
his
misdoings
and
no
concealment
of
his
sufferings
and
asking
for
influence
and
assistance
in
obtaining
a
or
such
other
employment
as
might
provide
him
with
bread
and
butter
and
the
answer
that
came
back
was
prompt
and
courteous
but
as
cold
as
the
breath
of
an
iceberg
he
appealed
to
the
banker
in
london
asking
for
a
junior
clerkship
or
a
position
as
messenger
or
even
porter
and
the
reply
he
received
was
as
smooth
as
a
dog
s
tongue
and
as
useless
for
help
and
healing
and
then
he
knew
by
bitter
knowledge
that
the
kindness
which
had
been
shown
to
him
in
the
better
time
was
kindness
to
his
father
s
son
and
that
he
had
wasted
that
heritage
and
was
his
father
s
son
no
more
meantime
he
spent
his
days
and
a
great
part
of
his
nights
also
in
the
streets
there
he
was
like
a
piece
of
helpless
driftwood
in
the
roaring
current
of
life
always
going
on
yet
never
going
anywhere
always
floating
along
yet
never
making
headway
the
ceaseless
stream
in
the
busy
thoroughfares
tormented
him
terribly
but
the
emptiness
of
the
obscurer
streets
tortured
him
still
more
and
the
blankness
of
sunday
morning
in
the
strand
afflicted
him
most
keenly
of
all
for
it
was
full
of
memories
of
sunday
morning
in
iceland
with
its
atmosphere
of
peace
and
rest
and
the
sound
of
church
bells
when
he
was
at
his
lowest
depths
of
hopelessness
he
sent
his
first
letter
home
dearest
mother
he
wrote
sitting
in
his
stuffy
back
room
overlooking
the
you
would
naturally
have
expected
to
hear
from
me
before
this
and
i
certainly
should
have
written
earlier
only
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
long
quiet
hour
in
which
i
could
tell
you
all
the
news
everything
that
has
happened
to
me
since
we
parted
on
the
steamer
and
i
saw
your
dear
face
disappearing
in
the
boat
that
hour
seems
never
to
come
so
i
must
snatch
a
few
moments
without
any
more
delay
to
say
that
all
is
well
and
everything
goes
swimmingly
the
dear
old
soul
why
should
i
make
her
miserable
he
thought
you
will
easily
understand
that
in
a
great
city
like
london
especially
when
one
is
beginning
again
and
one
has
so
much
to
do
and
so
many
people
to
see
there
is
not
an
hour
left
for
oneself
and
hardly
a
moment
to
write
a
letter
but
this
does
not
prevent
my
thinking
of
you
at
all
events
and
i
do
so
every
day
and
always
that
s
true
at
least
he
told
himself
and
he
went
on
boldly
with
his
affectionate
fictions
i
know
that
my
dear
little
mamma
will
want
to
know
first
the
condition
of
my
creature
comforts
and
i
hasten
to
tell
her
that
these
are
as
right
as
can
be
this
is
a
large
and
handsome
house
just
off
the
tide
of
greatest
traffic
where
splendid
horse
wagons
called
omnibuses
and
upholstered
sleighs
on
wheels
called
hansoms
roll
about
in
countless
numbers
day
and
night
making
a
roar
like
that
of
the
ellida
river
where
it
falls
into
the
fiord
but
my
bedroom
in
which
i
am
writing
this
letter
is
quiet
and
cozy
and
homelike
and
my
landlady
is
a
good
little
creature
who
visits
me
daily
and
is
always
most
kind
and
motherly
as
he
went
on
his
pen
flowed
freely
and
his
handwriting
became
big
and
reckless
i
am
making
new
and
influential
acquaintances
every
day
and
seeing
in
the
flesh
the
faces
we
are
all
familiar
with
in
prints
walking
in
the
park
yesterday
i
passed
the
queen
who
is
one
of
our
own
princesses
you
know
so
i
felt
myself
entitled
to
bow
to
her
and
she
bowed
back
with
the
sweetest
courtesy
i
see
the
prime
minister
frequently
for
he
lives
in
a
house
that
is
only
down
the
street
and
round
the
corner
and
the
homes
and
offices
of
nearly
all
the
ministers
of
state
are
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
this
place
in
fact
one
way
or
another
i
am
certainly
coming
in
touch
with
the
leading
men
in
england
and
when
i
open
my
window
at
night
i
can
see
the
light
that
burns
in
the
above
the
houses
of
parliament
so
you
see
that
i
am
finding
life
wonderfully
interesting
in
this
mighty
maelstrom
of
human
activity
and
if
i
do
not
write
as
often
as
i
ought
my
anxious
little
mamma
is
not
to
imagine
there
is
anything
amiss
with
me
but
merely
to
tell
herself
that
no
news
is
good
news
and
that
i
am
immersed
in
many
occupations
perhaps
if
i
have
a
lonely
hour
occasionally
the
pen
trembled
in
his
fingers
and
the
handwriting
became
loose
and
shaky
it
is
when
i
think
about
home
and
wonder
what
is
happening
there
and
what
people
are
saying
about
me
now
i
suppose
i
have
no
right
to
complain
whatever
it
may
be
but
sometimes
when
i
am
coming
back
to
my
lodging
on
a
starry
night
after
a
tiring
day
and
i
look
up
to
the
milky
way
and
think
that
is
the
road
to
my
country
the
thought
goes
to
my
heart
like
a
stab
that
when
i
left
it
last
my
father
s
door
was
closed
against
me
and
i
saw
nothing
of
magnus
at
the
end
how
are
they
both
and
how
are
you
and
how
are
the
factor
and
aunt
margret
and
how
oh
how
is
our
dear
little
elin
my
sweet
sweet
child
what
i
would
give
to
see
her
again
has
she
grown
is
she
still
as
much
like
her
poor
mother
does
she
notice
she
will
begin
to
babble
and
talk
by
and
by
will
they
bring
her
up
to
know
nothing
about
her
father
or
perhaps
to
think
ill
of
him
if
i
return
to
iceland
some
day
and
i
shall
to
take
up
the
broken
threads
of
my
life
again
and
find
that
the
mind
of
my
own
child
has
been
poisoned
against
me
i
don
t
know
what
will
happen
i
believe
i
shall
go
back
instantly
and
wipe
myself
out
for
ever
but
i
will
not
think
of
that
even
as
a
remote
possibility
and
meantime
i
am
working
day
and
night
to
build
up
a
new
career
and
as
you
see
i
am
getting
on
splendidly
so
dearest
and
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
everybody
at
home
for
we
shall
all
be
good
friends
oscar
is
helga
still
in
iceland
or
has
the
factor
carried
out
his
threat
of
sending
her
back
to
denmark
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
think
of
her
having
given
that
promise
to
the
governor
yet
i
can
not
help
doing
so
and
i
can
not
help
asking
it
was
the
time
when
a
young
english
composer
was
creating
some
sensation
by
writing
an
opera
on
the
subject
of
king
olaf
the
theme
was
one
which
oscar
had
often
proposed
to
himself
and
raised
his
fancy
and
emulation
upon
in
the
delirious
days
when
he
had
hoped
to
become
a
musician
and
the
dazzling
dreams
of
glory
were
not
yet
so
dead
that
he
could
restrain
himself
from
rambling
up
to
covent
garden
on
the
night
of
the
first
performance
he
knew
he
was
penniless
and
he
was
conscious
that
his
clothes
were
shabby
and
his
shoes
in
a
woful
condition
as
he
lounged
by
the
arches
and
watched
the
audience
assemble
the
carriages
were
rolling
up
and
discharging
their
occupants
the
queen
and
her
ladies
the
prime
minister
and
finally
the
king
and
he
was
turning
away
feeling
more
miserable
and
destitute
than
ever
when
a
hand
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
a
familiar
voice
at
his
side
said
cheerily
helloa
can
it
be
possible
it
was
neils
pinsen
his
former
schoolfellow
and
companion
fresh
and
bright
in
evening
dress
under
a
handsome
overcoat
heard
you
were
in
london
but
didn
t
know
where
to
find
you
want
to
see
you
immediately
old
fellow
where
do
you
stay
as
soon
as
he
had
got
rid
of
a
stifling
sensation
in
the
throat
oscar
answered
him
and
then
finsen
said
should
i
call
upon
you
there
or
would
you
prefer
to
come
here
to
me
i
will
come
to
you
said
oscar
good
when
shall
it
be
will
at
twelve
be
convenient
any
time
will
be
convenient
to
me
happy
man
twelve
in
my
office
then
glad
to
have
found
you
at
last
thought
you
might
have
looked
me
up
and
wondered
what
on
earth
had
become
of
you
busy
and
enough
work
for
a
regiment
by
the
way
if
you
would
like
to
see
the
performance
can
t
promise
you
a
seat
but
if
you
would
care
to
stand
at
the
back
of
the
balcony
you
would
come
this
way
johnson
take
this
gentleman
in
front
and
give
him
anything
you
have
left
before
oscar
had
quite
recovered
his
breath
he
was
sitting
in
the
at
the
back
of
the
upper
circle
feeling
miserably
humiliated
and
ashamed
yet
tingling
with
a
strange
excitement
he
never
quite
knew
what
happened
thereafter
he
forgot
that
his
money
was
all
gone
that
he
had
not
eaten
since
morning
that
his
trousers
were
frayed
at
the
bottom
and
his
shoes
down
at
the
heels
he
only
felt
that
out
of
the
sordid
conditions
of
the
past
six
months
he
had
suddenly
emerged
into
an
atmosphere
that
was
as
the
vivid
breath
of
his
soul
when
the
conductor
entered
it
was
the
young
composer
himself
oscar
craned
forward
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
man
who
was
on
the
eve
of
snatching
the
triumph
which
but
for
the
hard
buffetings
of
fate
might
perhaps
have
been
his
own
and
when
the
opera
began
he
listened
with
every
faculty
it
was
good
it
was
human
it
was
modern
its
harmony
was
exquisite
its
orchestration
sure
its
form
showed
mastery
of
the
mystery
of
music
and
yet
it
lacked
something
what
did
it
lack
it
lacked
the
of
the
stern
old
northland
the
englishman
could
not
give
it
that
for
the
root
of
the
matter
was
not
in
him
but
he
could
have
done
so
for
his
blood
was
the
blood
of
the
vikings
the
blood
of
flosi
and
snorri
and
eric
and
olaf
and
all
the
mighty
men
of
old
oscar
did
not
hear
his
go
to
bed
that
night
with
his
lunging
step
on
the
stairs
and
his
drunken
whistling
of
onward
christian
soldiers
and
next
morning
when
his
landlady
came
up
to
speak
to
him
according
to
her
wont
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
said
except
that
it
was
some
protest
some
threat
and
that
he
did
not
feel
it
worth
while
to
soften
and
sweeten
her
with
such
promises
as
he
had
made
before
the
intoxication
of
last
night
was
still
upon
him
when
he
set
out
to
keep
his
appointment
music
was
calling
to
him
again
calling
him
like
a
siren
out
of
his
friendlessness
and
loneliness
his
humiliation
and
obscurity
his
poverty
and
shame
out
of
the
pitiless
cruelty
of
crowded
thoroughfares
and
the
grimy
sordidness
of
obscure
streets
into
the
glory
of
success
and
fame
come
in
old
fellow
cried
the
familiar
voice
of
yesterday
and
oscar
found
himself
in
finsen
s
office
let
me
see
said
finsen
removing
a
pair
of
how
long
have
you
been
in
london
six
months
nearly
seven
said
oscar
and
what
have
you
been
doing
nothing
lucky
chap
nothing
at
all
yes
there
is
one
thing
i
ve
been
doing
i
ve
been
doing
it
rather
industriously
what
s
that
starving
finsen
laughed
loud
but
oscar
laughed
louder
he
had
not
yet
broken
his
fast
we
all
go
through
it
at
some
time
said
finsen
and
it
s
best
to
get
it
over
at
the
beginning
so
i
congratulate
you
old
fellow
and
now
to
business
i
m
managing
here
managing
for
a
syndicate
under
four
eyes
as
we
say
in
iceland
i
intend
to
give
a
series
of
concerts
and
i
m
looking
out
for
fresh
material
you
compose
used
to
do
said
oscar
i
understand
said
finsen
your
life
has
been
off
the
tracks
lately
and
you
ll
not
write
much
more
that
s
worth
anything
until
you
get
back
into
the
groove
but
i
know
what
you
used
to
do
and
that
s
good
enough
for
me
i
heard
some
of
your
songs
from
the
sagas
you
remember
and
i
don
t
mind
saying
that
as
the
work
of
a
man
who
was
nearly
in
the
matter
of
harmony
i
thought
them
wonderful
but
helga
tells
me
helga
neilsen
i
mean
i
hear
from
her
occasionally
oscar
flinched
as
if
a
lash
had
cut
him
helga
tells
me
continued
finsen
that
you
did
some
things
in
iceland
last
year
that
beat
your
saga
songs
to
little
bits
and
if
you
think
we
can
try
them
here
they
re
gone
said
oscar
i
know
said
finsen
i
ve
heard
what
has
become
of
them
but
perhaps
you
have
copies
not
a
copy
said
oscar
or
perhaps
you
can
remember
some
of
them
not
one
even
so
the
case
is
not
quite
hopeless
you
are
a
person
of
some
influence
in
iceland
used
to
be
said
oscar
well
i
presume
to
think
i
am
my
father
is
sheriff
and
likely
to
be
something
better
so
if
you
care
to
give
your
consent
we
may
recover
the
things
still
a
mist
arose
between
oscar
s
eyes
and
finsen
s
face
you
surely
do
not
mean
certainly
i
do
if
the
things
are
half
as
good
as
helga
says
they
re
worth
all
the
trouble
anyhow
i
m
willing
to
gamble
on
her
judgment
to
give
you
something
to
go
on
with
and
when
the
stuff
comes
to
devote
a
morning
to
trying
it
with
the
orchestra
and
ask
you
to
conduct
the
rehearsal
finsen
s
figure
was
floating
in
the
mist
that
was
between
it
and
oscar
s
eyes
you
wish
me
to
authorize
you
to
exhume
why
not
it
s
not
an
unheard
of
proceeding
and
if
ever
there
was
a
moment
that
justified
it
it
s
now
if
compositions
that
might
give
pleasure
to
the
world
and
make
pots
of
money
are
lying
buried
in
a
grave
i
ll
starve
first
said
oscar
rising
from
his
seat
my
dear
chap
said
finsen
putting
back
his
you
tell
me
you
re
doing
that
already
but
here
s
your
chance
of
doing
it
no
more
and
if
i
ll
starve
to
death
first
said
oscar
turning
to
the
door
nonsense
old
fellow
if
the
things
were
doing
any
good
where
they
are
i
could
respect
your
feelings
but
they
re
not
they
are
merely
rotting
away
and
they
will
soon
disappear
altogether
what
your
object
was
in
burying
them
you
know
best
i
confess
i
thought
it
very
quixotic
but
whatever
it
was
it
has
served
its
purpose
and
now
there
they
lie
works
of
genius
as
i
m
willing
to
believe
that
might
possibly
make
your
name
and
begin
to
make
your
fortune
while
you
i
ll
die
in
a
ditch
rather
than
touch
them
said
oscar
and
without
a
word
of
farewell
he
flung
out
of
the
room
no
words
could
describe
the
agony
he
endured
during
the
remaining
hours
of
that
day
the
intoxication
of
the
night
before
was
gone
by
this
time
and
he
suffered
the
pains
of
the
spirit
that
has
buoyed
itself
up
on
a
bankrupt
hope
if
he
had
ever
had
any
uncertainty
about
the
meaning
of
the
blind
impulse
of
remorse
which
had
prompted
him
to
bury
his
compositions
in
his
wife
s
grave
he
had
none
now
it
was
god
s
own
punishment
to
shut
up
the
only
channel
to
fame
and
success
nay
to
livelihood
itself
as
by
the
door
of
a
tomb
hour
after
hour
he
walked
the
streets
feeling
that
escape
from
the
way
of
life
he
had
been
living
was
now
utterly
hopeless
he
would
go
down
and
down
day
by
day
little
by
little
until
he
was
submerged
beneath
the
flood
or
became
but
for
the
mercy
of
god
a
vagabond
and
a
castaway
it
was
long
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
go
back
to
his
lodging
and
when
he
did
so
he
found
that
the
street
door
would
not
open
to
the
key
he
carried
in
his
pocket
he
rang
the
bell
and
a
little
came
up
as
from
her
bedroom
below
stairs
with
curl
papers
in
her
hair
and
some
loose
clothes
about
her
body
why
did
you
bolt
the
door
my
child
he
said
didn
t
you
know
that
i
had
not
come
home
yes
sir
but
mistress
told
me
to
tell
you
as
how
your
room
has
been
let
and
you
can
have
your
trunks
when
you
pay
what
you
owes
her
do
you
mean
that
i
am
to
be
turned
out
it
ain
t
my
fault
sir
and
i
m
very
sorry
oscar
and
the
girl
stood
looking
vacantly
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
then
he
turned
away
and
walked
up
the
street
with
a
new
sensation
the
blank
desolating
sensation
of
not
having
a
roof
over
his
head
no
one
knows
what
it
means
to
be
one
night
homeless
in
a
great
city
except
those
who
have
gone
through
it
it
is
not
so
much
the
poverty
of
privation
that
is
hard
to
bear
as
the
sense
of
utter
worthlessness
of
being
less
to
the
world
than
its
dogs
for
they
are
cared
for
or
its
horses
for
they
are
housed
his
money
was
gone
and
he
had
no
luggage
in
his
hands
to
make
shift
to
find
another
lodging
with
so
he
walked
on
and
on
up
lower
regent
street
and
across
piccadilly
through
noisy
throngs
of
people
young
women
smoking
cigarettes
young
men
laughing
and
singing
and
a
bedraggled
girl
being
lugged
along
by
a
policeman
on
and
on
until
he
came
to
a
wide
and
quiet
thoroughfare
where
a
line
of
broughams
waited
outside
a
house
that
was
brilliantly
lighted
up
and
there
he
paused
in
his
aimless
perambulation
to
listen
to
the
music
that
was
coming
through
the
open
windows
he
had
been
asking
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
so
lately
the
pampered
son
of
his
father
who
was
the
governor
of
his
people
and
their
upright
judge
was
tramping
the
streets
of
london
without
a
penny
in
his
pocket
or
a
roof
to
cover
him
when
the
door
opened
and
an
elderly
gentleman
came
out
to
escort
some
ladies
to
their
carriage
then
his
stunned
faculties
awoke
and
he
saw
where
he
was
standing
he
was
outside
the
house
of
his
father
s
friend
the
banker
the
deep
remembrance
came
back
to
him
of
the
time
so
near
yet
so
far
away
when
he
himself
with
thora
and
helga
had
been
honored
guests
in
that
house
and
lest
the
banker
should
see
him
the
wayfarer
he
then
was
skulking
there
at
that
untimely
hour
he
turned
about
and
walked
quickly
away
nothing
that
had
happened
on
that
evil
night
had
wounded
his
feelings
so
acutely
or
made
him
feel
so
surely
that
rescue
from
his
accursed
condition
there
could
be
none
was
it
to
be
a
part
of
his
punishment
that
even
when
his
senses
slept
he
was
to
be
constantly
brought
up
against
himself
and
reminded
of
the
days
that
were
dead
if
so
life
would
be
unendurable
and
existence
an
everlasting
hell
did
nature
never
forget
did
god
never
forgive
half
an
hour
afterward
he
was
walking
along
the
embankment
past
the
crouching
and
sleeping
forms
of
the
sordid
things
whom
the
city
casts
out
on
to
the
river
s
bank
by
night
and
looking
wildly
at
the
waters
of
the
thames
glistening
and
glimmering
under
the
electric
light
he
asked
himself
why
he
should
not
end
it
all
and
have
done
with
further
torture
what
was
the
thought
that
restrained
him
was
it
the
thought
of
his
dead
wife
whose
memory
was
to
be
a
safeguard
against
sin
and
a
perpetual
inspiration
no
by
the
inscrutable
will
of
fate
it
was
the
thought
of
the
one
being
whose
love
had
wrecked
him
it
was
the
thought
of
helga
in
spite
of
the
pledge
he
had
given
to
the
governor
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
her
no
day
had
been
so
dark
but
he
had
thought
of
her
on
going
to
bed
at
night
and
on
awakening
in
the
morning
she
was
gone
they
might
never
meet
again
their
love
was
a
page
of
his
life
which
he
had
crossed
out
and
turned
down
for
ever
yet
her
eyes
were
in
his
eyes
and
her
smile
was
the
only
sunshine
that
shone
upon
his
face
the
thought
of
thora
was
a
sweet
and
sacred
thing
which
he
had
wrapped
up
and
laid
by
in
the
lavender
of
memory
but
the
thought
of
helga
was
warm
and
alive
and
always
with
him
it
was
with
him
now
and
it
saved
his
soul
from
despair
and
his
body
from
death
before
oscar
s
letter
reached
iceland
many
changes
had
taken
place
there
the
estrangement
of
the
governor
and
the
factor
had
developed
into
open
antagonism
everybody
knew
of
it
and
the
enemies
of
each
had
been
playing
upon
his
hatred
of
the
other
the
factor
was
the
first
to
suffer
the
downfall
of
the
barter
trade
which
magnus
predicted
had
already
come
to
pass
and
the
factor
s
business
had
tumbled
to
pieces
like
an
unbound
faggot
there
is
always
a
good
reason
to
kill
a
fat
ox
and
while
people
said
the
factor
gives
the
farmers
what
he
likes
for
his
wool
and
charges
them
what
he
pleases
for
foreign
produce
the
true
ground
of
the
attack
upon
his
business
had
been
his
intimidation
of
the
town
at
the
time
of
oscar
s
election
oddsson
the
defeated
candidate
of
that
day
never
rested
until
he
had
established
a
company
on
the
cash
principle
even
then
the
factor
would
have
borne
down
all
opposition
for
the
factor
was
rich
while
the
farmers
were
poor
but
oddsson
had
secured
an
ally
in
the
most
powerful
person
as
the
smith
uses
the
tongs
to
spare
his
fingers
so
oddsson
had
used
the
governor
to
save
his
company
the
governor
knew
full
well
that
oddsson
was
his
enemy
and
that
if
his
party
got
the
upper
hand
they
would
upset
the
old
order
but
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
join
him
when
he
was
trying
to
destroy
the
factor
by
his
help
the
preferential
tariff
with
denmark
was
broken
down
and
the
iceland
markets
were
opened
to
english
produce
and
that
was
the
to
the
barter
business
for
three
months
the
factor
kept
his
doors
open
by
selling
at
less
than
cost
price
and
buying
at
more
than
market
value
but
the
end
was
sure
it
was
whispered
at
the
bank
that
he
was
parting
with
his
securities
in
stocks
and
shares
and
his
estate
in
land
and
loose
property
and
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
come
down
with
a
crash
nobody
pitied
him
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
tortured
heart
one
man
rejoiced
but
the
smiter
has
often
short
joy
of
his
stroke
and
when
oddsson
and
his
party
having
done
with
trade
turned
their
attention
to
constitutional
subjects
the
factor
though
he
hated
them
joined
their
agitation
the
winter
had
been
severe
there
had
been
many
deaths
among
the
older
members
of
parliament
and
as
often
as
a
had
occurred
the
factor
had
thrown
the
weight
of
his
remaining
influence
and
the
force
of
his
diminishing
fortunes
into
the
scale
of
reform
by
the
end
of
the
spring
it
had
become
certain
that
the
next
session
of
althing
would
witness
the
passing
of
a
bill
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
constitution
and
the
abolition
of
the
governorship
thus
each
of
the
two
men
who
had
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
for
fifty
years
destroyed
himself
in
destroying
the
other
and
the
prophecy
of
long
ago
was
fulfilled
that
if
the
governor
and
the
factor
ever
ceased
to
be
friends
they
would
become
the
bitterest
of
enemies
meantime
anna
had
tried
to
make
peace
and
failed
when
the
quarrel
was
young
and
chiefly
about
the
children
she
had
attempted
a
tone
of
sympathetic
protest
come
come
stephen
pardon
is
the
best
punishment
you
must
make
peace
with
the
factor
he
might
have
saved
my
son
by
the
lifting
of
his
hand
and
he
would
not
do
so
i
shall
never
make
peace
with
him
said
the
governor
oscar
neilsen
said
anna
meeting
the
factor
in
the
street
when
are
you
coming
to
see
stephen
if
you
stay
away
much
longer
the
will
fly
at
you
the
flew
at
me
when
i
was
there
last
anna
i
shall
never
trust
him
again
said
the
factor
when
the
quarrel
grew
old
and
ugly
and
personal
to
the
men
themselves
anna
thought
of
another
means
of
reconciliation
the
child
was
the
last
remaining
link
between
the
governor
and
the
factor
it
should
bring
them
together
again
god
has
always
a
use
for
these
little
angels
she
said
aunt
margret
joined
in
the
conspiracy
and
the
two
old
things
concocted
many
schemes
all
simple
and
transparent
but
womanly
and
good
to
get
the
men
into
the
same
room
they
never
succeeded
but
a
thousand
beams
of
sunshine
shone
out
of
the
baby
s
cradle
and
little
by
little
the
ice
that
had
frozen
about
the
men
s
souls
was
seen
to
melt
when
the
child
was
shortened
it
was
taken
over
to
government
house
and
wheeled
in
its
perambulator
into
the
governor
s
bureau
isn
t
she
a
beauty
stephen
said
anna
and
aunt
margret
said
the
precious
pet
couldn
t
possibly
be
more
like
her
father
if
she
were
not
so
wonderfully
like
her
mother
too
the
governor
looked
down
at
the
little
face
without
saying
a
word
and
when
the
child
blinked
up
at
him
with
the
eyes
of
thora
and
the
smile
of
oscar
he
went
to
his
bedroom
and
anna
heard
him
lock
the
door
when
the
child
cut
her
first
tooth
and
everybody
according
to
custom
ought
to
have
given
her
a
the
factor
coming
home
at
night
found
no
presents
on
the
nursery
table
but
the
little
one
was
propped
up
under
the
blue
lace
of
her
hooded
cradle
and
making
the
air
hideous
with
the
divine
discord
of
a
baby
s
rattle
that
s
stephen
s
present
and
it
must
have
cost
him
a
fortune
said
aunt
margret
whereupon
the
factor
weary
as
he
was
walked
out
into
the
road
where
he
could
hear
nothing
but
the
cold
lapping
of
the
lake
yet
love
of
the
little
one
was
not
bringing
the
two
men
together
it
was
thrusting
them
still
farther
apart
that
man
is
scheming
to
get
hold
of
the
child
thought
the
factor
he
and
his
have
robbed
me
of
my
daughters
and
now
they
re
trying
to
rob
me
of
my
granddaughter
also
she
s
my
son
s
child
thought
the
governor
and
my
son
s
child
is
my
child
why
did
i
allow
that
man
to
have
her
no
use
woman
said
aunt
margret
it
s
late
to
withdraw
the
sword
when
it
is
thrust
to
the
heart
but
then
came
oscar
s
letter
and
anna
s
hopes
went
up
with
a
bound
she
was
like
a
child
herself
in
her
joy
over
it
her
happiness
was
too
great
to
permit
her
to
see
holes
in
its
picture
of
prosperity
oscar
was
well
he
was
getting
on
splendidly
and
he
sent
his
love
to
everybody
she
read
the
letter
first
to
the
governor
and
after
he
had
heard
it
he
walked
out
into
the
where
the
were
building
their
nests
afresh
on
the
edge
of
the
fiord
and
the
were
coming
back
to
harbor
then
she
took
it
over
to
the
factor
s
rolled
it
up
in
the
baby
s
hand
like
another
rattle
and
left
it
with
aunt
margret
to
be
shown
to
her
brother
but
that
day
had
been
a
bad
day
with
the
factor
and
when
oscar
s
letter
came
back
to
anna
it
was
torn
across
the
middle
and
enclosed
in
an
empty
envelope
anna
was
nearly
at
the
treatment
of
her
treasure
for
no
girl
of
sixteen
had
ever
so
loved
her
first
and
she
had
intended
to
show
it
to
everybody
to
the
bishop
the
rector
the
sheriff
and
above
all
to
magnus
magnus
had
been
coming
and
going
at
intervals
throughout
the
winter
it
had
been
a
hard
one
for
him
as
for
others
and
he
had
begun
to
realize
what
it
would
be
when
his
father
was
gone
and
he
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
monstrous
mortgage
but
harder
to
bear
than
any
winter
had
been
the
sight
of
his
mother
s
sufferings
during
oscar
s
silence
any
news
yet
he
would
ask
and
anna
would
say
no
and
no
with
countless
explanations
and
excuses
so
it
was
through
the
dark
days
and
his
feeling
against
oscar
grew
hard
as
the
ground
he
trod
upon
but
when
the
snow
had
gone
and
he
went
up
with
the
spring
caravan
there
was
anna
with
a
face
like
the
rising
sun
and
by
that
he
knew
that
a
letter
must
have
come
at
last
sure
enough
in
less
than
a
minute
out
it
came
from
the
bosom
of
her
embroidered
treya
torn
across
as
the
factor
had
left
it
and
she
was
calling
on
him
to
write
an
answer
to
her
dictation
this
is
what
he
wrote
my
dear
son
your
letter
arrived
safely
by
the
last
steamer
and
made
up
by
its
welcome
news
for
the
long
time
we
had
to
wait
for
it
it
is
so
good
to
hear
that
you
are
well
and
prosperous
and
enjoying
your
life
in
the
great
english
city
many
a
time
i
feared
it
might
be
otherwise
but
now
i
have
your
letter
and
i
am
happy
and
contented
i
am
proud
that
my
son
is
rising
into
such
high
and
good
company
and
though
your
father
speaks
little
i
am
sure
that
he
feels
the
same
he
always
said
that
you
would
do
great
things
some
day
and
it
is
not
the
way
of
god
s
goodness
to
disappoint
such
expectations
where
they
are
built
on
a
good
foundation
and
now
i
have
to
tell
you
that
your
father
is
well
in
bodily
health
though
a
little
oppressed
by
worldly
anxieties
but
i
tell
him
our
home
in
this
life
is
always
on
a
steep
mountain
and
if
we
trust
in
god
there
is
no
reason
to
be
afraid
as
for
myself
i
am
as
well
as
can
be
expected
at
my
age
though
my
left
ear
troubles
sometimes
and
my
eyes
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
for
knitting
and
small
print
but
i
must
not
allow
myself
to
complain
for
perhaps
it
is
a
part
of
god
s
mercy
to
us
old
people
that
our
senses
should
die
by
degrees
so
that
when
they
come
to
die
altogether
we
may
not
be
taken
unawares
magnus
is
writing
this
letter
and
he
is
strong
and
hearty
the
snow
was
deep
at
the
farm
this
year
and
he
lost
six
of
his
best
beasts
but
his
lambs
came
beautifully
and
now
they
are
on
the
mountains
and
his
ewes
are
milking
well
and
the
is
closed
for
the
hay
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
one
you
ask
about
has
gone
back
to
her
mother
at
copenhagen
and
that
there
are
those
who
can
not
be
very
sorry
sometimes
to
silence
the
evil
tongues
that
speak
ill
of
you
here
i
am
tempted
to
blame
her
for
all
that
has
happened
but
who
am
i
to
judge
any
one
and
the
worst
i
wish
for
her
is
that
she
may
soon
become
a
girl
margret
neilsen
is
just
as
she
always
was
a
twisted
bough
with
plenty
of
sap
in
it
and
the
factor
would
be
well
enough
but
for
a
bad
hip
he
too
like
your
father
is
much
oppressed
by
worldly
cares
and
taking
it
ill
that
they
should
fall
so
fast
upon
him
in
the
evening
of
his
days
and
now
i
have
to
tell
you
of
your
little
elin
that
she
is
as
well
as
can
be
and
she
has
cut
two
front
teeth
and
her
hair
is
curling
over
her
forehead
she
is
the
best
child
that
ever
was
born
and
when
she
smiles
she
is
so
like
somebody
that
it
nearly
breaks
my
heart
to
look
at
her
margret
is
as
good
to
the
darling
as
if
she
were
her
own
mother
and
your
father
and
the
factor
can
hardly
see
the
sun
for
her
as
for
me
it
fills
my
heart
brimful
to
think
how
god
in
his
goodness
has
sent
us
old
folks
this
little
angel
after
our
late
troubles
for
she
is
like
the
spring
after
a
hard
winter
when
the
snow
and
ice
have
stayed
so
long
that
we
think
surely
we
shall
never
see
the
grass
or
hear
the
rivers
again
and
then
all
at
once
there
are
the
green
fields
and
the
shining
streams
and
all
the
gladness
of
the
flowers
and
now
though
you
are
getting
on
so
well
you
must
not
be
angry
with
your
mother
for
sending
you
a
little
present
maria
has
been
all
day
in
the
kitchen
packing
your
college
box
and
goodness
knows
what
things
she
may
have
put
in
it
but
i
am
knitting
you
a
pair
of
stockings
out
of
old
maggie
s
brown
wool
and
i
hope
you
will
not
be
ashamed
to
wear
them
for
they
will
keep
your
feet
warm
in
the
cold
weather
when
the
english
socks
must
be
so
thin
and
cottony
then
i
remember
how
fond
you
used
to
be
of
our
smoked
mutton
so
i
am
telling
maria
to
put
in
some
of
that
too
and
a
few
rolls
of
rullapilsa
i
dare
not
let
the
governor
know
i
am
sending
the
mutton
he
would
think
it
foolish
and
unnecessary
and
of
course
with
so
many
good
things
to
eat
and
drink
i
do
not
expect
you
to
offer
it
to
your
english
friends
but
perhaps
you
can
hide
it
in
a
cupboard
somewhere
and
take
a
slice
when
you
are
quite
alone
and
now
i
must
conclude
for
magnus
is
coming
to
the
end
of
his
paper
it
makes
me
happy
to
think
your
bedroom
is
comfortable
and
i
wish
i
could
thank
your
landlady
for
being
so
kind
and
motherly
i
may
never
see
her
in
this
world
but
we
shall
meet
in
heaven
some
day
and
then
i
will
thank
her
and
now
my
dear
son
in
the
midst
of
your
great
prosperity
do
not
forget
that
all
good
things
come
from
god
and
remember
to
put
your
trust
in
him
to
his
care
i
commit
you
for
he
knows
all
our
wants
and
all
our
troubles
and
all
our
secrets
and
his
eye
ever
watches
and
his
heart
never
sleeps
your
affectionate
mother
anna
when
oscar
received
his
mother
s
letter
he
was
living
in
a
slum
in
westminster
it
was
called
short
street
and
it
was
a
typical
example
of
the
mean
streets
which
nearly
always
and
in
all
countries
lie
near
to
a
great
minster
like
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
short
street
was
a
whereof
one
end
was
a
and
the
other
an
archway
to
the
railway
depot
of
a
suburban
necropolis
late
at
night
the
inhabitants
were
kept
from
sleep
by
the
quarreling
of
tipsy
men
who
had
been
turned
out
of
the
and
early
in
the
morning
they
were
awakened
by
the
rumbling
of
the
hearses
that
rattled
the
corpses
over
the
cobbles
of
the
street
oscar
s
home
in
short
street
was
at
number
one
a
grimy
house
with
a
soiled
card
in
the
fanlight
above
the
door
saying
lodgings
for
single
men
besides
himself
there
were
four
lodgers
three
of
them
being
porters
at
the
funeral
depot
and
the
fourth
head
barman
at
the
the
had
the
parlor
floor
and
he
generally
brought
home
a
number
of
noisy
companions
at
closing
time
to
play
cards
and
drink
beer
oscar
s
bedroom
in
this
house
was
not
so
much
a
room
as
a
stifling
closet
of
miserable
aspect
in
which
the
refuse
furniture
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
range
itself
in
order
a
threadbare
carpet
an
iron
bedstead
without
foot
or
head
a
painted
washstand
a
water
ewer
two
or
three
rickety
chairs
a
table
that
was
safest
when
it
rested
against
the
wall
a
few
pictures
of
on
the
remains
of
a
dirty
and
a
blotched
by
damp
like
a
sheet
of
ice
spotted
and
scabbed
by
thaw
his
landlady
lived
in
the
basement
and
was
never
seen
except
on
monday
mornings
when
she
went
round
for
her
lodgers
rent
some
two
or
three
hours
before
the
collector
called
for
her
own
the
only
person
whom
oscar
saw
constantly
was
the
landlady
s
servant
jenny
a
typical
cockney
girl
of
the
humblest
class
untidy
and
unclean
but
as
bright
as
a
london
street
sparrow
and
with
a
big
soft
heart
in
her
vulgar
little
breast
jenny
had
conceived
a
certain
affection
for
oscar
based
on
no
grounds
more
personal
than
that
he
did
not
shout
at
her
down
the
pairs
of
stairs
or
take
liberties
or
use
bad
language
and
that
he
always
raised
his
hat
when
he
passed
her
in
the
street
the
only
effect
of
this
sentimental
attitude
on
jenny
s
part
was
that
she
always
dressed
in
her
clean
print
on
the
days
when
oscar
happened
to
be
at
home
to
tea
and
it
was
on
one
of
these
afternoons
that
she
came
knocking
at
the
door
of
his
bankrupt
garret
and
said
letter
for
you
sir
it
was
so
long
since
oscar
had
received
a
letter
of
any
kind
that
he
leaped
up
with
a
kind
of
fear
and
on
taking
the
envelope
out
of
jenny
s
hand
and
seeing
it
was
addressed
in
magnus
s
writing
and
had
been
sent
on
from
his
former
lodging
he
turned
pale
and
trembled
is
it
bad
news
sir
said
jenny
i
wouldn
t
a
brought
it
up
on
no
account
if
i
d
knowed
no
no
leave
me
jenny
said
oscar
and
when
the
girl
had
gone
and
he
had
opened
the
letter
with
nervous
fingers
he
read
it
with
eyes
that
were
wet
with
tears
while
his
cheeks
were
flushed
with
shame
when
he
came
to
the
end
his
heart
was
beating
wildly
and
he
was
asking
himself
if
it
would
not
be
the
brave
and
manly
thing
to
write
at
once
and
say
that
all
this
story
of
his
prosperity
was
a
miserable
fiction
that
he
had
never
been
otherwise
than
wretched
that
he
was
living
in
a
common
way
among
common
companions
doing
common
work
which
he
dare
not
think
of
and
that
no
words
could
express
the
secret
agony
of
his
soul
at
having
sunk
so
low
but
deep
as
was
the
degradation
of
that
bitter
hour
it
was
not
so
deep
as
that
of
the
following
morning
when
jenny
came
lugging
his
college
box
and
chattering
gaily
as
if
she
had
brought
him
a
fortune
the
railway
man
said
as
ow
it
was
as
eavy
as
lead
so
i
give
im
twopence
for
isself
i
ope
i
did
right

jenny

long
way

lorry

from
there
and
the
neighbors
says
it
s
a
pity
e
don
t
go
back
they
never
says
that
about
you
though
he
s
so
perlite
they
says
oscar
allowed
the
girl
to
open
the
box
and
empty
it
of
its
contents
and
as
she
did
so
she
chirped
away
like
the
street
sparrow
that
she
was
while
he
sat
with
the
mist
of
his
boyish
associations
floating
up
to
him
from
the
happy
past
well
i
never
she
cried
sitting
back
on
her
heels
as
she
knelt
before
the
box
polonies
and
sausages
and
pickled
tongues
and
hams
why
you
won
t
ave
to
buy
nothin
to
eat
for
months
isn
t
that
lucky
now
just
when
you
re
out
too
is
it
a
present
yes
it
is
a
present
jenny
they
must
think
somethin
of
ye
as
sends
ye
a
present
like
this
said
jenny
and
then
after
a
moment
in
a
fluttering
voice
is
it
a
laidy
sir
it
s
my
mother
said
oscar
your
mother
said
jenny
in
a
tone
of
relief
well
that
s
what
i
do
call
a
mother
being
good
to
anybody
like
this
she
has
been
good
to
me
all
my
life
jenny
and
all
my
life
i
ve
treated
her
badly
jenny
looked
at
him
strangely
as
if
something
surprised
and
pained
her
you
have
sir
shamefully
jenny
yet
she
has
forgiven
me
again
and
again
jenny
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
she
said
mothers
is
like
that
isn
t
they
now
there
s
jim
cobb
the
shandry
man

to
you
jenny
me
i
m
an
orfling
said
jenny
and
then
lowering
her
voice
to
a
tone
of
confidence
she
added
i
don
t
mind
tellin
you
but
i
am
i
always
tells
the
other
lodgers
as
my
mother
was
one
o
them
girls
as
ye
see
at
the
aquarium
at
nights
covered
with
silks
and
diamonds
and
was
she
a
look
of
dejection
crossed
jenny
s
face
i
don
t
see
as
she
could
ave
been
because
they
say
at
the
orflinage
as
i
was
born
in
holloway
when
my
mother
was
doin
time
by
this
time
the
contents
of
the
box
were
ranged
on
the
table
and
chairs
and
jenny
was
sitting
back
on
her
heels
again
to
look
at
them
there
they
re
as
pretty
as
a
am
and
beef
shop
and
i
do
believe
as
that
s
what
your
mother
meant
em
for
too
jim
cobb
e
wanted
me
to
set
one
up
with
im
but
not
me
not
as
i
ave
any
objections
to
the
am
and
beef
business
and
if
anybody
else
thought
of
starting
it
jenny
s
hint
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
a
vehicle
stopping
suddenly
outside
the
house
now
i
bet
ye
i
know
who
that
is
she
said
with
a
wink
it
s
that
blessed
jim
cobb
again
he
s
always
me
to
go
for
a
ride
in
is
shandry
but
going
to
the
window
she
cried
goodness
it
s
a
handswim
cab
and
there
s
a
laidy
out
of
it
a
lady
you
can
t
see
er
now
she
s
on
the
steps
there
she
is
cried
jenny
as
a
came
to
the
street
door
and
me
not
ad
time
to
comb
my
air
yet
with
an
indefinable
feeling
of
mingled
fear
and
hope
which
there
was
yet
no
cause
for
oscar
stood
on
the
landing
and
listened
while
jenny
ran
down
the
stairs
when
the
street
door
was
opened
he
heard
his
own
name
in
a
voice
that
sent
the
blood
to
his
head
and
made
him
reel
with
dizziness
a
moment
later
jenny
came
back
with
a
face
that
looked
white
even
under
the
smudges
that
soiled
it
and
she
said
in
the
same
fluttering
voice
as
before
i
thought
as
much
it
s
you
she
s
askin
for
i
ve
took
er
into
the
barman
s
parlor
e
won
t
be
ome
till
tea
oscar
went
slowly
but
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
his
breath
was
coming
and
going
in
gusts
and
his
heart
was
beating
against
his
breast
as
with
the
blows
of
a
hammer
the
parlor
door
stood
ajar
and
a
perfume
he
knew
was
coming
out
to
him
after
a
moment
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
then
she
whom
he
expected
to
see
was
standing
before
him
she
herself
more
radiantly
beautiful
than
ever
with
something
soft
and
white
about
her
neck
and
a
face
shining
with
smiles
how
much
he
lived
in
that
moment
no
one
could
say
a
hundred
emotions
coursed
through
his
soul
like
the
flash
of
flame
joy
delight
pain
shame
the
rapture
of
seeing
her
the
humiliation
of
being
found
in
such
a
common
place
the
degradation
of
being
and
obviously
poor
but
above
all
love
the
uncontrollable
love
that
leads
men
on
to
happiness
and
victory
or
to
ruin
and
death
his
face
broke
up
tears
burst
from
his
eyes
and
holding
out
both
hands
he
cried
helga
my
god
helga
helga
appeared
to
be
not
less
excited
than
oscar
himself
she
was
genuinely
moved
to
see
how
the
joy
he
had
in
meeting
her
affected
him
and
when
he
had
kissed
both
her
hands
she
kissed
one
of
his
and
tears
which
she
could
not
keep
back
came
to
her
eyes
also
there
was
a
shiny
sofa
in
the
room
and
they
sat
on
it
side
by
side
and
hand
in
hand
i
have
never
never
been
so
glad
he
said
and
i
am
glad
too
she
said
let
me
look
at
you
again
oscar
a
little
paler
and
perhaps
a
little
thinner
but
otherwise
not
changed
in
the
least
yet
you
have
changed
a
great
deal
helga
grown
older
have
i
grown
lovelier
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
at
that
she
leaned
her
face
toward
him
and
he
kissed
her
and
for
some
moments
they
could
not
restrain
their
fondness
helga
was
the
first
to
recover
and
now
let
us
talk
seriously
she
said
but
oscar
was
still
quivering
with
excitement
and
having
brushed
away
his
tears
he
laughed
hysterically
how
long
have
you
been
in
london
he
asked
a
month
a
month
she
replied
and
to
think
that
i
have
never
known
it
until
now
but
how
did
you
come
to
leave
copenhagen
that
s
just
what
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
my
father
for
some
unknown
reason
elected
to
reduce
my
mother
s
income
by
half
so
something
had
to
be
done
then
i
remembered
neils
finsen
and
the
wonderful
things
he
used
to
say
about
my
voice
finsen
repeated
oscar
in
a
graver
tone
so
i
wrote
to
him
and
he
answered
that
if
i
would
come
to
london
he
would
have
experts
to
hear
me
and
then
they
would
see
what
could
be
done
well
well
well
i
came
and
the
experts
heard
me
and
they
concluded
that
my
voice
was
quite
unusual
the
most
promising
soprano
they
had
found
for
years
and
now
now
i
m
at
the
royal
academy
of
music
and
by
and
by
i
am
to
go
to
paris
for
two
years
three
years
perhaps
four
to
study
under
marchesi
or
bonby
and
to
attend
an
acting
class
and
finally
i
am
to
be
taken
to
monte
carlo
or
nice
in
representations
of
faust
and
someo
as
a
first
step
toward
taking
london
by
storm
as
marguerite
or
juliette
there
and
finsen
is
doing
all
this
for
you
well
yes
so
to
speak
i
suppose
i
must
say
that
is
he
to
pay
your
expenses
i
really
don
t
know
who
is
to
pay
them
but
i
ve
signed
a
contract
to
come
out
under
his
management
and
to
refund
everything
when
i
am
fairly
launched
and
now
about
yourself
oscar
about
me
it
s
nearly
a
year
since
i
saw
you
last
what
have
you
been
doing
oscar
made
a
clumsy
laugh
oh
i
m
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
i
toil
not
neither
do
i
spin
but
his
forced
gaiety
broke
down
badly
and
he
said
more
soberly
don
t
ask
me
what
i
ve
been
doing
helga
helga
s
eyes
wandered
around
the
room
for
a
moment
and
then
she
said
i
know
neils
told
me
something
about
it
and
he
wished
me
to
say
before
she
could
finish
oscar
had
risen
to
his
feet
if
you
come
from
finsen
i
know
what
your
errand
is
and
i
would
rather
die
no
no
said
helga
clinging
to
his
nervous
hand
sit
down
it
s
not
that
at
all
listen
he
sat
and
the
sweetness
of
her
look
banished
all
his
fears
they
re
giving
what
they
call
promenade
concerts
at
covent
garden
and
a
few
days
ago
there
was
some
difference
with
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
it
seemed
desirable
to
make
a
change
and
the
question
was
who
the
new
leader
ought
to
be
naturally
i
thought
of
you
of
me
why
not
didn
t
i
see
what
you
could
do
with
those
hundred
and
fifty
numskulls
at
thingvellir
but
covent
garden
my
dear
oscar
i
ve
seen
every
leader
they
have
here
and
while
they
are
all
your
superiors
in
knowledge
and
experience
there
s
not
one
of
them
with
a
tittle
of
your
magnetism
and
genius
so
i
said
neils
if
you
want
the
finest
leader
that
london
has
ever
seen
let
me
go
and
fetch
him
but
you
can
t
know
helga
you
can
t
imagine
if
you
had
the
least
idea
of
what
i
ve
gone
through
to
live
merely
to
live
helga
looked
around
the
room
again
and
she
said
can
t
i
see
haven
t
i
got
eyes
but
if
you
were
to
tell
me
that
nobody
has
had
any
use
for
you
in
the
meanest
work
that
is
ever
done
by
the
commonest
men
i
should
still
say
what
i
said
to
finsen
oscar
s
throat
was
hurting
him
the
thought
of
helga
s
faith
and
championship
broke
down
his
he
never
allowed
himself
to
think
there
could
be
any
selfish
ground
for
it
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
helga
he
asked
to
meet
me
in
finsen
s
office
at
eleven
o
clock
morning
but
i
vowed
i
could
never
set
foot
in
the
place
again
you
didn
t
know
then
that
should
ask
you
and
i
do
ask
you
oscar
he
remembered
the
promise
he
had
given
to
his
father
he
reflected
on
the
danger
of
reopening
a
page
of
his
life
which
he
had
crossed
out
and
turned
down
as
for
ever
he
thought
of
finsen
and
his
interest
in
helga
and
the
hold
he
would
have
of
her
through
her
hopes
and
ambitions
and
his
will
was
like
a
broken
withe
for
the
controlling
destiny
of
his
life
was
leading
him
on
you
will
be
there
will
you
not
she
whispered
and
oscar
answered
yes
she
leaned
her
face
forward
again
and
again
he
kissed
her
and
then
she
rose
to
go
where
are
you
staying
he
asked
and
she
told
him
it
was
in
a
fashionable
on
the
edge
of
the
green
park
does
finsen
live
there
also
well
yes
he
lives
in
the
same
building
and
you
must
live
there
too
i
shall
want
to
see
you
constantly
there
are
a
thousand
things
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
but
now
i
must
be
off
he
could
not
let
her
go
and
they
renewed
their
caresses
it
will
seem
like
a
dream
when
you
are
gone
he
said
i
shall
hardly
be
able
to
believe
you
have
been
here
or
that
you
will
ever
come
back
again
don
t
say
that
i
told
you
in
iceland
that
i
should
come
to
you
if
you
didn
t
come
to
me
and
i
ve
kept
my
word
haven
t
i
my
dear
dear
helga
it
wasn
t
quite
good
of
you
to
go
away
without
giving
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
again
i
know
i
know
you
had
a
certain
duty
to
me
you
know
after
what
had
passed
hush
dear
hush
but
i
m
willing
to
believe
it
was
the
fault
of
other
people
don
t
let
us
speak
of
it
helga
said
oscar
and
his
arms
which
had
been
about
her
in
a
close
embrace
slackened
away
and
fell
it
was
easier
to
part
with
her
after
that
but
before
he
opened
the
door
he
kissed
her
again
and
when
he
helped
her
into
the
hansom
he
put
her
fingers
to
his
lips
he
stood
on
the
pavement
oblivious
to
all
surroundings
until
the
cab
had
rounded
the
corner
of
the
public
house
and
helga
had
waved
to
him
through
the
glass
then
he
became
aware
that
the
sight
in
that
sordid
slum
of
so
lovely
a
girl
so
beautifully
dressed
and
with
a
hansom
waiting
for
her
had
brought
the
neighbors
to
their
doors
and
that
the
women
were
thumbing
their
and
grinning
to
each
other
across
the
rails
when
he
reentered
the
house
jenny
passed
him
in
the
lobby
with
a
stealthy
and
guilty
air
which
seemed
to
say
that
her
poor
tortured
little
soul
had
not
resisted
the
temptation
to
listen
and
to
watch
he
returned
to
the
parlor
for
a
moment
and
the
perfume
of
helga
s
presence
was
still
to
be
felt
there
over
the
odor
of
dead
ale
and
tobacco
never
had
he
envied
the
barman
before
but
at
that
moment
he
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
to
keep
this
room
for
the
rest
of
the
day
that
he
might
sit
on
the
sofa
where
helga
had
sat
and
lay
his
hand
on
the
table
where
her
hand
had
rested
and
kiss
the
carpet
where
her
feet
had
trod
he
was
like
a
man
moving
in
a
dream
and
when
he
went
back
to
his
own
apartment
he
was
not
conscious
of
his
squalid
surroundings
the
dirty
the
threadbare
carpet
and
the
blotched
humiliated
and
compromised
him
no
longer
his
body
was
still
in
his
bankrupt
garret
but
his
soul
was
far
away
it
was
in
another
world
a
world
that
was
bright
with
helga
s
eyes
as
its
sun
and
stars
for
he
was
going
over
again
the
time
he
had
spent
with
her
every
word
of
it
every
tone
every
look
every
gesture
this
lasted
the
whole
of
the
day
and
when
darkness
fell
a
curtain
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
the
life
he
had
been
living
during
the
past
twelve
months
the
mire
and
slime
of
vulgar
associations
the
degradation
of
common
companionship
the
sense
of
loneliness
of
friendlessness
of
being
nothing
and
nobody
the
deep
remembrance
of
being
homeless
and
hopeless
and
helpless
and
useless
all
this
had
gone
that
passage
of
his
life
was
over
now
and
never
never
never
would
its
pain
and
shame
come
back
to
him
again
he
had
passed
through
it
because
he
had
sinned
but
if
he
had
sinned
he
had
suffered
and
god
himself
had
seen
that
he
had
suffered
enough
his
eyes
were
wet
when
he
lay
down
on
his
soiled
pillow
but
he
fell
asleep
in
a
blissful
condition
and
in
the
first
dream
of
the
night
he
was
back
with
helga
once
in
the
dark
hours
he
awoke
and
heard
the
deadened
hum
of
the
barman
and
his
friends
at
their
cards
and
ale
and
again
he
awoke
in
the
dawn
and
then
he
heard
the
hearse
of
the
necropolis
thundering
up
short
street
and
rumbling
under
the
archway
at
the
top
of
it
at
eleven
o
clock
that
morning
he
went
to
covent
garden
and
again
and
again
at
eleven
the
following
mornings
he
went
there
on
the
tenth
morning
he
called
to
jenny
who
had
grown
shy
of
him
and
was
leaving
his
breakfast
on
a
tray
outside
his
door
and
said
jenny
i
wish
you
to
tell
your
mistress
that
i
shall
be
leaving
this
lodging
in
another
week
then
jenny
s
white
and
wistful
face
broke
down
utterly
and
with
a
crack
in
her
voice
and
the
ghost
of
a
smothered
sob
in
it
she
said
i
knowed
as
it
ud
come
to
this
the
minit
i
set
eyes
on
er
i
said
as
she
d
take
ye
away
from
me
she
the
governor
never
knew
that
oscar
had
broken
faith
with
him
when
the
time
came
for
the
next
session
of
althing
a
bill
for
the
reform
of
the
constitution
reenacting
the
abolition
of
the
governorship
and
the
appointment
of
a
minister
was
passed
by
a
large
majority
but
an
act
involving
a
constitutional
change
had
to
be
voted
by
two
parliaments
and
therefore
a
dissolution
of
althing
became
necessary
the
time
of
dissolution
was
at
the
discretion
of
the
governor
and
he
might
have
delayed
it
until
the
fever
for
reform
had
passed
instead
of
doing
so
he
decided
to
dissolve
immediately
thus
feeding
the
agitation
and
precipitating
his
own
fate
many
things
befall
the
man
whose
day
is
done
and
the
measure
of
the
governor
s
errors
was
not
yet
full
when
the
time
came
to
select
the
candidates
it
was
found
that
the
constituency
for
which
oscar
had
sat
the
capital
was
once
more
without
its
man
and
to
everybody
s
astonishment
the
governor
himself
in
order
to
secure
a
voice
in
the
popular
assembly
determined
to
stand
for
it
this
unusual
step
on
the
governor
s
part
created
great
excitement
but
the
fever
increased
tenfold
when
it
was
announced
that
the
factor
intended
to
oppose
him
never
had
popular
feeling
run
so
high
as
on
the
night
when
the
governor
and
the
factor
had
to
confront
each
other
on
the
same
hustings
the
better
people
stayed
away
being
sorry
and
ashamed
that
these
two
friends
of
fifty
years
should
claw
each
other
face
to
face
like
eagles
but
the
baser
sort
were
reveling
in
the
prospect
of
that
spectacle
and
the
artisan
s
institute
was
crowded
you
learn
a
lot
when
your
servants
quarrel
they
told
each
other
and
they
were
not
to
be
disappointed
the
sheriff
was
in
the
chair
and
it
was
clear
from
the
beginning
that
his
rivalry
of
the
governor
did
not
prompt
him
to
restrain
either
candidate
from
making
a
fool
of
himself
bad
luck
is
a
quick
voter
and
the
governor
played
into
the
sheriff
s
hands
without
suspicion
and
without
delay
the
once
silent
and
dignified
man
had
lost
all
reticence
and
and
when
his
time
came
to
speak
he
flung
innuendoes
on
every
side
if
you
hate
a
man
all
his
deeds
are
hateful
and
coming
at
length
to
the
factor
s
business
life
the
governor
said
never
is
selfishness
satisfied
my
friends
will
you
commit
the
care
of
your
public
purse
to
one
who
in
order
to
grasp
all
is
losing
all
and
hurling
himself
into
bankruptcy
and
want
this
thrust
was
received
with
ironical
cheers
and
counter
cheers
not
unmixed
with
derisive
laughter
and
when
the
factor
s
turn
came
he
said
with
a
humorous
leer
over
a
face
that
was
white
as
death
a
blunt
knife
should
seek
the
joints
and
not
hack
at
the
solid
bone
but
if
it
comes
to
asking
conundrums
i
ll
ask
one
also
will
you
commit
the
care
of
your
public
purse
to
one
whose
son
was
banished
from
the
country
because
he
was
a
forger
and
a
thief
this
charge
against
oscar
often
whispered
but
never
before
publicly
uttered
fell
on
the
reeking
crowd
with
the
effect
of
a
thunderbolt
and
before
the
audience
had
recovered
from
its
astonishment
the
governor
was
on
his
feet
again
against
all
rule
and
order
saying
in
a
loud
voice
and
will
you
commit
the
charge
of
your
public
morality
to
a
man
who
in
his
youth
contracted
an
alliance
with
an
abandoned
woman
and
only
married
his
mistress
after
his
first
daughter
had
been
born
a
bastard
this
was
the
climax
of
sensation
the
chewing
and
spitting
crowd
were
silent
save
for
the
sound
of
their
audible
breathing
which
was
like
the
hissing
of
an
ebbing
wave
the
factor
was
pallid
and
speechless
as
if
the
governor
s
cruel
word
had
struck
all
sensibility
as
well
as
sneering
out
of
his
face
while
the
governor
faced
him
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
blazing
cheeks
and
lips
that
quivered
convulsively
thus
the
two
men
stood
for
a
long
moment
with
scarcely
a
yard
s
space
between
them
and
then
a
big
man
was
seen
to
be
parting
the
people
at
the
back
of
the
platform
and
coming
forward
with
great
strides
it
was
magnus
and
he
was
making
for
his
father
as
if
to
take
him
forcibly
away
but
before
the
governor
had
seen
him
or
could
be
conscious
of
his
presence
another
hand
an
unseen
hand
had
been
laid
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
blow
on
the
brain
that
was
like
a
stroke
from
heaven
the
governor
had
realized
that
in
returning
the
insult
of
the
factor
in
his
mad
wrath
and
blind
passion
he
had
outraged
the
memory
of
thora
and
that
thora
was
in
her
grave
and
he
had
loved
her
better
than
any
human
soul
that
was
not
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
then
the
noisome
place
in
its
ghastly
silence
spun
round
him
and
with
a
low
whine
like
that
of
a
poisoned
dog
he
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
magnus
took
him
up
and
carried
him
home
he
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
there
was
only
one
nomination
for
the
capital
the
factor
was
returned
unopposed
and
when
the
writs
came
back
from
the
country
it
was
found
that
the
reform
party
had
a
larger
majority
than
before
the
governor
made
a
slow
recovery
but
he
was
moving
about
by
the
time
that
althing
was
next
in
session
and
when
the
constitutional
question
came
up
again
he
hobbled
down
to
parliament
house
on
two
sticks
in
spite
of
all
remonstrance
and
took
a
seat
in
his
little
room
overlooking
the
legislative
chamber
the
debate
was
short
and
not
exciting
and
no
one
looked
toward
the
alcove
in
which
the
governor
sat
in
his
faded
uniform
a
doddering
shadow
of
his
old
authority
but
many
cruel
sallies
of
clumsy
wit
were
aimed
in
that
direction
the
governor
grew
more
and
more
indignant
and
at
length
he
rose
frothing
at
the
lips
to
protest
against
unmerited
insult
and
was
put
down
by
the
speaker
who
had
formerly
been
his
own
private
secretary
the
act
was
passed
by
acclamation
there
was
much
cheering
with
the
usual
nine
hurrahs
after
god
save
the
king
and
then
the
fallen
man
was
carried
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
had
a
second
seizure
and
he
never
left
his
room
again
but
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
speech
he
occupied
his
time
dictating
petitions
to
the
king
praying
him
not
to
give
his
sanction
to
an
act
that
was
designed
to
degrade
his
servant
after
a
few
weeks
magnus
came
to
persuade
his
father
and
mother
to
leave
government
house
and
make
their
home
at
the
farm
it
s
of
no
use
to
resist
parliament
sir
he
said
the
new
minister
will
be
appointed
presently
and
why
should
you
wait
until
he
turns
you
out
come
to
thingvellir
i
m
strong
i
can
work
for
all
of
us
but
his
father
flew
at
him
in
a
fury
how
dare
you
make
such
a
proposition
he
said
and
how
dare
you
show
your
face
in
this
house
don
t
you
know
that
you
have
been
the
cause
of
everything
if
it
had
not
been
for
what
you
did
at
the
beginning
none
of
this
mischief
would
have
happened
as
for
the
new
minister
if
he
comes
here
to
turn
me
out
tell
him
to
bring
my
coffin
with
him
do
you
hear
me
tell
him
to
bring
my
coffin
the
idea
that
magnus
was
really
to
blame
for
all
that
had
occurred
being
the
first
cause
and
origin
of
the
trouble
grew
upon
the
governor
day
by
day
so
that
oscar
seemed
to
be
without
fault
and
even
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
martyr
he
called
upon
anna
to
read
oscar
s
letter
to
him
again
and
when
he
had
heard
it
a
second
time
he
was
so
seized
by
the
idea
that
the
prime
minister
of
england
was
a
friend
of
his
son
s
that
he
had
himself
propped
up
in
bed
in
order
that
he
might
write
to
oscar
with
his
own
hand
calling
on
him
to
defeat
his
father
s
enemies
you
have
great
influence
now
oscar
and
you
must
save
your
father
from
the
machinations
of
these
malicious
scoundrels
of
whom
the
worst
and
most
devilish
is
the
factor
that
was
what
he
thought
he
was
writing
but
his
poor
brain
was
far
gone
by
this
time
and
the
paper
he
scribbled
on
over
the
counterpane
was
merely
covered
with
unintelligible
curves
and
strokes
which
anna
could
not
send
on
to
oscar
when
it
seemed
certain
that
the
intensity
of
the
governor
s
wrath
would
kill
him
and
that
he
would
die
with
nothing
in
his
heart
but
hatred
of
the
factor
anna
and
aunt
margret
put
their
heads
together
and
thought
of
a
way
to
soften
his
feelings
and
sweeten
his
end
it
centered
in
the
child
as
before
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
they
said
they
took
little
elin
to
the
governor
s
bedroom
and
left
her
to
play
on
the
floor
she
had
grown
to
be
the
sweetest
thing
with
an
angel
s
face
a
little
beam
of
spring
sunshine
that
ran
about
the
room
and
talked
but
the
only
effect
of
her
presence
was
to
make
the
sick
man
stretch
his
arms
to
a
safe
near
the
head
of
his
bed
and
take
out
a
roll
of
papers
nobody
knew
what
the
papers
were
except
that
they
were
old
and
that
they
crinkled
in
his
stiff
fingers
he
kept
them
under
his
pillow
at
all
times
save
when
his
bed
was
being
made
and
then
he
smuggled
them
into
the
breast
of
his
when
the
women
talked
of
elin
and
all
her
pretty
ways
and
sweet
mysteries
of
childish
the
governor
talked
of
oscar
although
his
memory
was
confused
about
recent
events
it
was
wondrously
clear
about
distant
ones
and
he
had
countless
stories
of
oscar
as
a
child
some
of
them
were
humorous
and
he
would
laugh
at
them
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
distorted
face
but
all
were
meant
to
show
that
oscar
was
not
like
other
children
and
when
he
had
come
to
an
end
he
would
say
my
son
is
a
great
man
now
as
i
always
said
he
would
be
and
when
he
gets
my
letter
you
ll
see
what
he
will
do
meantime
the
act
had
been
sent
over
to
denmark
and
the
sheriff
had
been
called
across
to
copenhagen
there
was
only
one
thing
that
this
could
mean
and
in
the
absence
of
telegraphic
communication
the
little
capital
sat
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
steamer
that
was
to
bring
the
sheriff
back
she
was
due
on
a
sunday
night
and
the
of
the
cathedral
stood
ready
to
ring
a
peal
in
honor
of
the
new
minister
the
governor
heard
that
the
laura
was
expected
and
he
conceived
the
idea
that
oscar
was
coming
with
her
to
bring
the
king
s
veto
and
to
scatter
his
father
s
enemies
he
was
very
ill
that
day
and
doctor
olesen
had
said
he
might
not
last
until
morning
but
he
would
have
nobody
to
nurse
him
and
magnus
who
had
come
at
his
mother
s
call
but
dared
not
show
his
face
to
his
father
sat
on
the
stairs
outside
the
door
aunt
margret
was
coming
and
going
during
the
whole
of
the
day
and
toward
evening
the
factor
himself
was
seen
tramping
to
and
fro
outside
the
house
looking
up
at
intervals
at
the
governor
s
windows
with
a
face
in
which
the
madness
of
love
and
fear
was
fighting
with
the
greater
madness
of
pride
and
wrath
at
length
anna
went
out
to
him
and
said
oscar
neilsen
come
into
the
house
to
see
your
old
friend
not
till
he
asks
me
not
till
he
asks
me
said
the
factor
whereupon
anna
went
indoors
again
and
whispered
over
the
bed
of
the
dying
man
stephen
the
factor
is
outside
and
he
only
wants
to
be
asked
to
come
in
he
must
come
in
on
his
knees
then
said
the
governor
and
that
was
the
end
of
everything
the
steamer
did
not
arrive
that
night
and
the
went
to
bed
but
at
daybreak
when
the
in
the
bay
were
breaking
through
a
veil
of
mist
and
the
sunlight
was
glistening
on
the
the
bells
began
to
ring
merrily
for
the
laura
was
sailing
up
the
fiord
with
flags
floating
from
stem
to
stern
magnus
heard
the
bells
and
then
a
shuffling
movement
in
his
father
s
bedroom
a
little
later
he
heard
the
hurrahs
of
people
cheering
in
the
streets
and
then
a
smothered
echo
of
the
same
sound
at
the
other
side
of
his
father
s
door
hurrah
hurrah
cried
the
people
outside
echoed
the
voice
within
at
the
next
moment
the
house
shook
as
with
a
heavy
fall
and
magnus
burst
into
his
father
s
bedroom
his
father
lay
in
his
on
the
floor
he
was
dead
but
his
face
was
smiling
and
in
his
withered
hands
were
the
crinkled
papers
on
which
oscar
in
his
boyhood
had
scribbled
his
childish
compositions
later
the
same
day
magnus
wrote
to
oscar
this
is
to
tell
you
that
our
father
died
this
morning
i
think
he
died
happy
but
the
mail
did
not
leave
until
the
end
of
the
week
and
under
magnus
s
message
anna
wrote
for
herself
he
loved
you
to
the
last
and
we
hav
berrid
him
next
to
our
dere
thora
when
oscar
received
the
news
of
his
father
s
death
he
was
near
the
close
of
what
he
had
believed
to
be
the
happiest
period
of
his
life
his
success
as
a
leader
of
orchestra
had
been
substantial
and
immediate
and
when
the
concerts
at
covent
garden
came
to
an
end
he
had
been
offered
engagements
in
other
quarters
there
didn
t
i
know
what
i
was
talking
about
helga
said
but
this
is
nothing
to
the
reputation
you
will
make
when
you
consent
to
appear
as
a
composer
ah
that
is
past
praying
for
oscar
answered
with
a
shake
of
the
head
but
all
the
same
he
was
pleased
and
happy
on
leaving
his
dismal
lodgings
in
short
street
he
took
rooms
in
the
same
house
with
helga
and
finsen
at
the
corner
of
piccadilly
and
the
green
park
there
the
three
friends
lived
the
innocent
lives
of
children
observing
few
of
the
restrictions
which
society
imposes
on
the
manners
and
conduct
of
men
and
women
helga
s
was
the
general
rendezvous
and
the
men
used
it
with
the
utmost
freedom
oscar
in
particular
was
nearly
always
to
be
found
there
except
in
the
mornings
when
helga
was
at
the
academy
and
in
the
evenings
when
he
was
himself
at
the
theater
no
hour
was
too
early
and
hardly
any
hour
too
late
for
oscar
to
call
on
helga
he
ate
with
her
played
with
her
sang
with
her
read
with
her
and
helped
her
with
her
lessons
mozart
cherubini
ouseley
macfarren
parry
and
again
mozart
their
work
was
all
play
and
their
play
was
all
music
helga
was
more
than
satisfied
that
oscar
should
be
always
with
her
always
assisting
her
always
praising
and
encouraging
and
inspiring
her
and
he
on
his
part
was
entirely
happy
to
devote
himself
to
her
service
to
think
for
a
moment
that
this
was
all
she
wished
for
all
she
wanted
with
him
was
more
than
his
heart
was
capable
of
on
their
off
days
and
nights
they
went
to
other
concerts
and
attended
the
english
cathedral
services
and
the
masses
at
catholic
oratories
heard
the
old
masterpieces
over
and
over
again
became
familiar
with
nearly
every
new
opera
oratorio
symphony
and
voluntary
and
studied
the
methods
of
most
of
the
great
singers
and
players
who
appeared
in
london
it
was
one
long
feast
of
music
eaten
at
the
table
of
love
they
had
their
social
pleasures
too
and
kept
open
house
on
sundays
sometimes
they
supped
or
dined
at
restaurants
with
their
new
friends
who
were
chiefly
finsen
s
friends
and
then
brought
their
hosts
back
to
helga
s
rooms
for
cards
and
conversation
until
one
two
or
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
it
was
a
reckless
irresponsible
unconventional
life
a
little
like
the
life
oscar
had
lived
at
college
a
little
like
the
life
helga
had
lived
with
her
mother
at
copenhagen
and
more
than
a
little
dangerous
though
they
never
thought
of
that
oscar
found
only
one
cause
for
uneasiness
and
that
concerned
finsen
a
certain
pride
which
he
felt
at
first
in
finsen
s
interest
in
the
girl
he
loved
the
girl
who
loved
him
soon
gave
place
to
jealousy
he
was
jealous
of
finsen
s
hold
over
helga
his
control
of
her
career
his
power
over
her
destiny
little
by
little
this
became
a
gnawing
anxiety
until
at
length
every
pleasant
word
helga
exchanged
with
finsen
and
every
smile
she
gave
him
seemed
to
go
to
oscar
s
heart
like
a
stab
he
spoke
to
her
on
the
subject
and
she
only
laughed
at
him
for
his
folly
her
endearing
words
and
caresses
dissipated
his
uneasiness
for
a
time
but
it
always
came
back
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
finsen
presumed
on
his
position
as
the
one
who
was
finding
the
ways
and
means
and
that
finsen
s
friends
interpreted
this
attitude
according
to
the
morality
of
the
atmosphere
they
lived
in
at
length
to
ease
the
secret
gnawing
at
his
heart
oscar
proposed
that
they
should
marry
why
not
there
was
no
longer
any
impediment
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
damaging
misconceptions
remembering
the
past
he
thought
helga
would
have
received
his
proposal
with
delight
but
times
had
changed
since
they
were
together
in
iceland
and
a
cheerless
smile
hung
about
her
lips
as
she
shook
her
head
she
showed
him
how
fatal
marriage
at
this
stage
would
be
to
a
girl
in
her
position
fatal
to
her
aims
her
ambitions
her
standing
with
the
public
and
above
all
with
the
men
to
whom
she
had
to
look
for
favors
until
he
felt
almost
as
much
ashamed
as
if
he
had
proposed
a
guilty
thing
but
why
should
you
be
jealous
she
said
approaching
him
to
embrace
him
if
is
so
there
may
certainly
be
some
cause
she
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
added
business
is
business
you
know
and
i
may
have
to
do
things
in
the
future
which
neither
of
us
could
wish
unless
she
whispered
laying
her
head
on
his
breast
my
bad
boy
will
at
length
consent
to
be
true
to
himself
and
to
his
genius
and
promise
to
write
the
great
works
i
know
he
can
write
and
let
me
sing
them
all
over
the
world
then
she
cried
with
passion
while
her
eyes
shone
and
her
arms
clutched
his
neck
then
he
will
see
what
i
can
do
to
this
and
such
as
this
oscar
answered
no
no
or
it
s
impossible
or
don
t
let
us
talk
of
it
but
helga
s
endearing
words
and
caresses
again
and
again
repeated
were
like
the
water
from
sunny
streams
which
trickles
between
the
snow
and
the
frozen
rock
and
brings
down
the
avalanche
at
last
the
days
passed
they
kept
no
count
of
them
six
months
a
year
a
year
and
a
half
and
at
length
the
time
approached
when
helga
according
to
the
program
which
had
been
mapped
out
for
her
was
to
leave
the
academy
of
music
and
begin
her
lessons
in
paris
the
prospect
of
an
early
separation
was
a
constant
nightmare
to
oscar
who
was
striving
in
vain
to
devise
schemes
to
prevent
it
when
that
secret
play
of
fate
which
men
call
chance
helped
out
by
the
blind
strivings
of
human
passion
brought
him
unexpectedly
to
the
end
he
aimed
at
one
day
finsen
came
dashing
into
helga
s
with
his
mouth
full
of
news
the
syndicate
which
held
the
theater
and
casino
in
one
of
the
principal
towns
of
the
riviera
had
applied
to
him
to
recommend
a
leader
of
orchestra
who
should
be
capable
of
controlling
a
season
of
opera
he
had
recommended
oscar
his
recommendation
had
been
accepted
and
it
had
been
left
to
him
to
conclude
terms
with
the
company
s
servant
and
to
despatch
him
without
delay
if
a
desire
to
separate
oscar
from
helga
had
been
a
part
of
finsen
s
plan
his
hopes
were
instantly
frustrated
for
helga
herself
cried
splendid
but
if
oscar
is
to
control
the
opera
season
why
can
t
i
go
also
he
can
put
me
into
small
parts
under
an
assumed
name
in
that
distant
place
where
i
can
never
be
recognized
and
that
will
be
better
practise
for
the
stage
than
all
the
in
christendom
admirable
idea
shouted
oscar
and
finsen
not
was
compelled
to
agree
it
was
while
oscar
s
heart
rode
high
on
this
last
freak
of
fortune
while
he
was
preparing
for
his
flight
to
the
riviera
and
while
helga
was
writing
to
paris
to
postpone
her
lessons
that
the
letter
came
from
iceland
and
fell
on
him
like
a
thunderbolt
the
sight
of
a
envelope
addressed
in
magnus
s
handwriting
sent
the
blood
rushing
to
his
head
it
was
long
before
he
could
gather
courage
to
open
it
feeling
numb
and
faint
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
went
out
into
the
park
to
breathe
and
to
think
he
had
not
written
to
his
mother
since
the
early
days
in
his
first
lodging
being
afraid
to
write
from
short
street
from
dread
of
disclosing
his
poverty
or
from
piccadilly
from
fear
of
saying
anything
about
helga
as
a
consequence
he
had
heard
nothing
from
home
since
anna
s
letter
the
only
news
that
had
reached
him
had
come
through
finsen
by
way
of
his
father
and
concerned
public
matters
chiefly
the
fall
of
the
barter
trade
the
passing
of
the
new
act
and
the
progress
of
the
elections
some
one
belonging
to
him
was
dead
who
could
it
be
for
no
other
reason
than
that
little
elin
was
the
youngest
and
frailest
he
concluded
that
it
must
be
the
child
his
poor
motherless
darling
he
reproached
himself
with
having
thought
so
little
of
her
amid
the
appeals
of
an
absorbing
passion
yet
he
had
thought
of
her
he
had
thought
he
would
go
back
for
her
some
day
as
it
was
his
right
and
duty
to
do
and
so
make
amends
to
thora
in
the
care
and
love
he
would
bestow
on
her
child
but
perhaps
that
atonement
was
impossible
now
and
his
sweet
child
was
with
her
mother
in
heaven
oscar
thought
that
of
all
disasters
that
could
befall
him
at
home
the
death
of
his
child
would
be
the
worst
but
when
at
length
he
opened
his
letter
and
found
that
it
was
his
father
who
was
gone
from
him
his
grief
was
greater
still
his
dear
father
who
had
loved
him
better
perhaps
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
whom
he
had
rewarded
the
worst
he
remembered
the
forgery
and
felt
choked
with
shame
he
thought
of
the
promise
to
break
with
helga
and
felt
crushed
by
remorse
his
father
who
had
pampered
him
and
cherished
such
high
hopes
for
him
that
should
never
be
realized
never
justified
now
was
dead
far
away
in
iceland
and
had
loved
him
to
the
last
sitting
on
a
bench
under
a
tree
he
was
trying
to
read
again
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
fading
light
and
the
blinding
mist
in
his
eyes
the
written
sob
of
his
mother
s
misspelled
postscript
when
a
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
to
say
the
gates
were
closing
and
then
the
dull
hum
of
london
s
burrowing
mazes
fell
on
his
ear
again
helga
had
expected
him
in
her
room
that
afternoon
to
make
the
last
arrangements
for
their
journey
but
the
sun
set
the
evening
closed
the
night
fell
and
he
did
not
come
next
morning
he
walked
in
with
drooping
head
and
a
dejected
step
and
she
saw
that
something
had
occurred
you
have
had
bad
news
oscar
what
is
it
my
father
is
dead
he
answered
and
after
that
they
sat
for
some
moments
without
speaking
then
helga
recovered
herself
her
brain
had
been
going
like
a
and
she
said
scarcely
above
her
breath
well
what
do
you
intend
to
do
i
intend
to
go
hack
said
oscar
back
to
iceland
yes
to
my
mother
and
my
child
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
and
at
the
sight
of
her
face
so
full
of
pain
and
disappointment
the
blood
rushed
from
his
heart
and
he
said
helga
why
shouldn
t
you
go
with
me
why
shouldn
t
we
marry
and
go
back
together
i
know
it
is
a
good
deal
to
ask
dear
but
we
should
be
everything
to
each
other
and
i
should
make
up
to
you
for
any
sacrifice
by
my
devotion
and
love
what
matter
if
we
have
to
forget
our
cherished
dreams
and
aspirations
life
is
the
fulfilment
of
duty
and
our
duty
is
at
home
mine
is
at
all
events
and
if
you
will
share
it
if
you
will
go
back
with
me
he
stopped
suddenly
and
dropped
his
head
on
his
hands
and
his
elbows
on
his
knees
with
every
word
he
uttered
the
impossibility
and
folly
of
what
he
proposed
forced
itself
upon
him
and
the
blood
that
had
flamed
up
to
his
head
fell
back
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
helga
sat
a
moment
without
speaking
then
she
said
in
a
steady
voice
i
m
sorry
very
sorry
but
it
s
impossible
if
i
had
nothing
and
nobody
else
to
think
about
i
should
have
to
think
of
neils
he
has
spent
money
upon
me
and
i
have
given
him
a
contract
therefore
i
can
t
run
away
from
him
like
that
oscar
drew
deep
gasping
breaths
and
answered
then
i
must
go
alone
it
will
be
hard
terribly
hard
but
i
must
go
there
is
the
mortgage
i
must
take
up
that
burden
now
that
my
father
is
gone
i
can
not
let
anybody
else
be
borne
down
by
it
and
then
there
is
the
child
i
ve
not
done
too
much
for
her
hitherto
and
it
is
my
duty
my
sacred
duty
the
child
is
all
right
oscar
aunt
margret
is
taking
care
of
her
nothing
you
could
do
for
the
little
mite
would
be
half
as
good
as
is
being
done
for
her
already
as
for
the
mortgage
you
can
bear
that
burden
just
as
well
in
england
as
in
iceland
better
far
better
you
ll
earn
more
money
here
ten
times
a
hundred
times
more
and
then
think
of
the
difficulty
of
beginning
over
again
under
the
old
conditions
everybody
must
know
everything
by
this
time
they
do
i
know
they
do
she
rose
and
standing
over
him
she
stroked
his
hair
the
uncombed
curls
of
his
fair
hair
and
said
softly
no
no
dear
you
can
never
go
back
to
iceland
until
you
go
back
rich
and
famous
and
you
may
i
say
you
may
and
then
i
too
perhaps
but
he
covered
his
ears
with
his
hands
for
what
helga
was
saying
sounded
like
mockery
meantime
you
can
not
think
of
leaving
me
especially
now
when
i
want
your
help
so
badly
and
when
everything
depends
upon
it
my
work
and
my
future
she
dropped
to
her
knees
by
his
side
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
say
you
will
not
leave
me
dearest
say
you
will
not
she
loaded
him
with
caresses
she
addressed
him
by
every
endearing
name
she
conquered
him
he
felt
that
the
impulse
to
go
back
to
iceland
the
impulse
of
duty
was
overcome
by
the
rapture
of
love
and
that
he
must
stay
where
helga
was
whatever
happened
i
belong
to
you
body
and
soul
helga
do
as
you
like
with
me
he
said
and
you
will
go
to
the
riviera
yes
if
he
had
known
what
he
was
saying
he
would
rather
have
called
upon
the
river
to
carry
him
to
its
lowest
depths
and
count
him
in
the
of
its
damned
but
none
of
us
can
foresee
the
future
we
must
all
bow
before
the
unknown
the
engagement
on
the
riviera
was
completely
successful
and
oscar
covered
himself
with
honor
but
when
the
opera
season
came
to
an
end
he
declined
all
offers
to
come
back
finsen
was
there
under
cover
of
professional
and
fraternal
interest
he
had
made
frequent
visits
to
oscar
and
helga
during
the
course
of
the
season
and
at
the
close
of
it
he
was
staying
at
the
same
hotel
oscar
was
nervous
fretful
and
unhappy
the
secret
gnawing
anxiety
which
had
oppressed
him
in
london
had
returned
with
redoubled
force
helga
s
love
of
the
gaiety
and
grandeur
of
the
life
of
the
riviera
was
only
too
evident
and
finsen
set
himself
to
feed
it
he
fed
it
by
every
art
and
resource
of
a
full
purse
and
an
open
hand
races
regattas
fêtes
flowers
he
gave
her
everything
that
was
being
enjoyed
by
other
women
living
in
abundance
oscar
protested
but
she
laughed
at
his
protests
or
tried
to
coax
him
out
of
his
jealousy
her
caresses
and
endearments
were
beginning
to
fail
of
their
old
effect
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
certain
contempt
for
her
and
at
some
moments
even
a
sort
of
hatred
which
tore
his
heart
to
pieces
for
his
own
part
oscar
hated
the
life
of
the
riviera
what
nature
had
done
for
the
place
was
good
but
what
man
had
done
was
bad
the
soft
air
the
blue
sky
the
deep
blue
sea
the
smiling
gardens
the
flowers
the
oleanders
the
orange
groves
the
scent
of
the
resin
and
then
the
still
nights
and
the
nightingale
could
anything
be
more
enchanting
yet
this
paradise
of
nature
this
corner
of
the
earth
was
degraded
by
every
gross
desire
that
was
at
war
with
beauty
and
art
and
genius
and
the
everlasting
laws
of
life
but
oscar
s
hatred
of
the
riviera
was
due
to
a
cause
more
personal
than
his
moral
revolt
a
poignant
memory
of
the
past
in
the
casino
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
gardens
beyond
the
brilliant
hall
and
the
noisy
orchestra
there
was
an
inner
room
guarded
by
and
watched
by
spies
where
men
and
women
sat
about
a
table
in
a
dusky
and
clammy
silence
and
at
the
end
of
that
room
in
the
darkest
part
of
it
there
was
an
alcove
almost
covered
by
palms
where
two
persons
could
sit
unseen
helga
and
he
had
once
sat
there
and
she
had
pleaded
with
him
to
do
something
that
his
soul
shrank
from
and
he
had
done
it
why
not
she
had
said
he
will
never
hear
of
it
and
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
form
my
luck
must
change
it
must
and
then
we
will
pay
back
this
money
and
everything
will
be
wiped
out
do
oscar
for
me
please
from
fear
of
reviving
this
memory
oscar
had
avoided
the
casino
during
his
present
visit
that
was
easy
enough
to
do
while
the
opera
season
lasted
but
when
it
was
over
and
his
work
no
longer
wanted
him
it
was
hard
to
see
helga
go
off
with
finsen
night
after
night
and
to
wander
round
the
casino
like
an
uneasy
spirit
that
could
find
no
rest
while
they
were
inside
of
it
the
jealousy
that
was
rankling
in
his
breast
could
not
bear
that
ordeal
long
and
when
helga
said
what
nonsense
you
needn
t
play
why
should
you
he
followed
her
into
the
he
saw
the
usual
sights
there
and
found
the
usual
company
gathered
about
the
tables
all
whatever
their
rank
and
station
the
financier
the
millionaire
the
baron
the
peer
the
duchess
smoking
her
cigarettes
and
then
the
prostitute
in
her
feathers
and
the
in
his
diamonds
as
well
as
reputable
men
and
virtuous
women
for
the
knows
no
distinctions
of
means
or
morality
or
intellect
and
is
the
high
court
of
the
devil
s
democracy
on
the
night
of
oscar
s
first
visit
helga
played
and
lost
and
seeing
the
strained
look
in
her
face
his
very
soul
felt
sick
and
he
walked
out
into
the
gardens
on
the
second
night
she
lost
again
and
he
saw
her
borrow
from
finsen
who
stood
behind
her
on
the
third
night
it
was
finsen
who
played
and
he
won
largely
and
then
helga
who
sat
by
his
side
seemed
to
be
intoxicated
by
excitement
and
delight
next
day
she
showed
him
a
costly
jewel
which
finsen
had
bought
for
her
out
of
his
winnings
for
luck
she
said
and
when
oscar
protested
against
the
present
she
said
but
why
shouldn
t
i
take
it
every
penny
he
spends
on
me
makes
me
more
necessary
to
him
for
the
future
come
dear
don
t
be
jealous
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
i
should
have
to
do
things
that
neither
of
us
could
wish
at
this
and
such
as
this
oscar
s
sense
of
shame
was
choking
him
his
feeling
for
helga
was
now
in
a
perpetual
alternation
between
love
and
hate
he
loved
her
he
hated
her
he
despised
her
he
was
proud
of
her
and
this
red
riot
in
his
blood
was
driving
him
to
despair
at
one
moment
he
thought
her
nature
was
utterly
selfish
and
that
she
would
sacrifice
anything
and
anybody
to
gain
her
ends
at
the
next
moment
he
believed
she
loved
him
with
an
unselfish
love
but
that
her
disposition
was
such
that
she
had
to
struggle
between
her
love
for
him
and
her
love
for
luxury
and
success
and
therefore
she
was
as
much
an
object
for
pity
as
himself
sometimes
when
he
walked
in
the
gardens
of
the
casino
he
remembered
how
thora
had
suffered
as
he
was
suffering
now
and
then
while
the
nightingale
sang
unseen
above
his
head
and
the
peace
of
the
night
soothed
his
soul
he
told
himself
he
was
rightly
punished
as
he
had
done
so
he
was
being
done
by
and
now
the
manly
thing
was
to
leave
helga
and
go
away
and
then
if
she
loved
him
she
would
suffer
too
and
that
would
be
his
best
revenge
but
at
other
times
when
he
saw
helga
wearing
the
bracelets
and
brooches
which
finsen
had
given
her
he
felt
that
flight
was
impossible
that
he
must
fight
this
man
with
his
own
weapons
and
subdue
this
woman
on
her
own
terms
yet
how
was
he
to
do
it
when
he
asked
himself
that
question
one
answer
and
one
only
came
back
to
him
with
every
breath
he
drew
in
that
atmosphere
of
gamblers
the
old
delusive
mocking
answer
he
must
do
it
by
means
of
play
but
while
he
had
money
enough
for
his
own
needs
he
had
none
for
the
and
it
was
not
at
first
that
he
saw
a
way
to
the
means
with
which
to
begin
suddenly
an
idea
came
to
him
he
would
make
the
man
himself
find
the
means
and
without
waiting
to
consider
this
without
pausing
to
count
the
cost
with
his
pulses
throbbing
painfully
and
his
heart
leaping
with
a
devilish
joy
he
hurried
into
the
casino
and
drew
finsen
aside
to
the
alcove
covered
by
palms
and
said
in
a
false
and
tremulous
voice
old
friend
do
you
remember
the
first
time
i
called
on
you
at
covent
garden
when
you
said
you
were
starving
perfectly
you
offered
me
something
if
i
would
sell
you
some
compositions
of
mine
that
are
buried
in
iceland
and
you
said
you
would
die
in
a
ditch
first
would
you
still
be
disposed
to
take
your
chance
with
them
why
not
my
father
is
minister
now
there
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
and
you
would
be
prepared
to
pay
me
the
money
at
once
certainly
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
to
sign
the
necessary
authorization
i
m
ready
to
sign
it
now
said
oscar
in
the
same
tremulous
voice
within
ten
minutes
everything
was
settled
and
oscar
was
pocketing
the
notes
that
were
being
paid
on
finsen
s
account
from
the
treasury
of
the
casino
his
hands
were
trembling
his
lips
quivering
and
his
face
was
white
so
you
re
caught
by
the
fever
at
last
old
fellow
laughed
finsen
and
what
you
wouldn
t
do
before
to
feed
your
stomach
you
are
doing
now
to
feed
your
luck
just
so
to
feed
my
luck
said
oscar
that
night
oscar
played
carefully
and
won
the
following
night
he
played
more
freely
and
won
again
on
the
third
night
he
took
the
bank
and
won
once
more
he
took
the
bank
on
the
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
many
succeeding
nights
with
the
same
result
such
a
rapid
and
unbroken
run
of
luck
had
scarcely
ever
been
seen
the
manager
of
the
casino
a
plausible
person
with
a
rubicund
face
congratulated
oscar
the
house
had
rarely
had
a
banker
so
popular
as
well
as
so
fortunate
and
it
rejoiced
in
his
success
meantime
oscar
was
never
for
a
moment
his
own
man
he
seemed
to
be
laboring
under
a
wild
intoxication
of
soul
in
a
fortnight
he
had
become
rich
but
he
had
no
love
for
money
for
himself
and
he
heaped
it
upon
helga
there
were
presents
to
outshine
finsen
s
excursions
in
steam
launches
and
in
automobiles
and
even
some
social
entertainments
the
winsome
and
young
leader
of
the
opera
with
his
handsome
if
reckless
became
objects
of
attention
they
gave
one
or
two
dinners
in
the
restaurant
of
the
casino
where
the
rich
of
all
nations
ate
their
food
in
the
glitter
of
a
thousand
diamonds
and
to
the
music
of
an
orchestra
in
red
coats
and
black
silk
stockings
then
the
change
came
the
inevitable
change
one
night
it
became
evident
that
the
tide
of
oscar
s
luck
had
turned
he
did
not
flinch
he
doubled
his
risk
and
played
on
the
ebb
set
in
with
frightful
rapidity
and
every
night
he
increased
his
stakes
and
lost
his
money
with
a
smile
at
the
end
of
a
week
helga
who
had
been
transported
with
rapture
became
pallid
with
alarm
your
luck
is
leaving
you
hadn
t
you
better
stop
she
said
but
he
would
not
listen
he
touched
bottom
at
last
sitting
in
his
usual
seat
he
called
for
fresh
counters
and
said
with
a
laugh
life
or
death
this
is
my
last
do
you
mean
that
said
helga
and
he
nodded
and
laughed
again
finsen
had
been
punting
silently
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
now
helga
went
over
to
him
and
stood
behind
his
chair
it
was
only
the
straw
that
told
how
the
wind
was
blowing
but
oscar
saw
it
and
his
twitching
face
grew
red
the
inscrutable
gods
of
chance
seemed
to
hover
over
the
table
a
greater
risk
than
that
of
money
depended
on
the
issue
of
the
nest
coup
and
both
men
knew
it
when
the
cards
had
been
cut
oscar
served
them
slowly
very
slowly
and
when
he
came
to
the
last
card
his
trembling
fingers
seemed
loath
to
turn
it
he
turned
it
at
last
with
a
rapid
movement
and
at
the
same
moment
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
laughed
he
had
lost
and
the
clammy
silence
was
broken
are
you
going
asked
helga
in
a
listless
tone
with
wandering
eyes
certainly
and
you
not
yet
neils
is
winning
splendidly
then
in
a
moment
as
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
his
intoxication
of
soul
left
him
and
he
saw
where
he
was
and
what
he
had
done
he
had
taken
money
from
finsen
to
permit
the
grave
of
his
wife
to
be
opened
and
he
had
gambled
with
that
money
and
lost
it
when
he
saw
things
in
this
way
he
could
scarcely
stand
upright
but
with
an
effort
he
walked
out
of
the
down
the
corridor
where
the
spies
were
watching
past
the
restaurant
where
the
sluggards
were
smoking
through
the
hall
where
the
band
was
playing
and
out
into
the
garden
there
he
looked
for
a
dark
place
and
sat
on
a
bench
under
a
tree
the
night
was
clear
and
quiet
the
stars
were
out
and
the
sea
was
singing
in
the
distance
but
he
could
hear
nothing
except
an
owl
that
was
hooting
somewhere
in
the
eaves
oh
for
the
snows
of
his
own
country
to
cool
his
hot
forehead
oh
for
the
storms
of
iceland
to
silence
the
babel
in
his
brain
when
he
thought
of
his
conduct
he
hated
himself
and
when
he
remembered
his
temptation
he
hated
helga
also
the
one
hatred
counteracted
the
other
or
he
would
have
destroyed
himself
he
must
live
if
only
to
subdue
helga
to
bring
her
to
his
feet
and
then
to
cast
her
off
forever
how
was
he
to
do
this
there
was
one
way
but
it
was
closed
to
him
closed
by
the
vow
he
had
made
when
he
stood
by
the
open
coffin
of
his
wife
and
in
punishment
of
himself
for
having
neglected
her
and
sinned
against
her
he
had
sworn
before
god
to
bury
his
ambitions
in
her
grave
and
never
write
another
line
of
music
as
long
as
he
lived
if
he
could
only
wipe
out
that
vow
if
he
could
only
begin
again
if
he
could
only
say
to
himself
some
day
oscar
stephenson
is
dead
but
that
could
never
be
and
oscar
stephenson
must
go
on
to
the
end
trailing
the
slag
of
his
life
behind
him
deciding
to
return
to
england
immediately
he
walked
back
to
the
hotel
and
asked
for
his
bill
when
it
was
given
to
him
he
found
that
the
money
remaining
in
his
purse
was
hardly
sufficient
to
discharge
his
debt
and
pay
the
expense
of
his
journey
without
a
moment
s
thought
he
sat
down
and
wrote
to
helga
dear
helga
i
want
to
go
back
to
london
by
the
midnight
train
and
i
find
i
am
a
little
short
for
my
railway
ticket
send
me
a
hundred
francs
by
the
messenger
who
brings
you
this
letter
and
for
mercy
s
sake
do
not
keep
him
too
long
waiting
i
can
not
live
in
this
place
another
night
oscar
he
had
lavished
so
many
presents
upon
her
that
he
never
dreamt
she
could
refuse
him
but
this
was
the
answer
that
came
back
dearest
oscar
how
unlucky
i
ve
just
this
very
minute
lost
my
last
sou
and
you
don
t
like
me
to
borrow
from
finsen
but
you
bad
boy
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
about
going
off
at
midnight
it
s
impossible
your
devoted
helga
oscar
had
nothing
that
he
could
turn
into
money
except
his
watch
and
that
was
his
father
s
gift
and
all
he
had
to
remember
him
by
but
after
a
sharp
struggle
he
called
for
the
manager
and
parted
with
his
keepsake
when
his
bill
was
paid
and
his
luggage
ready
the
clock
across
the
gardens
was
striking
eleven
he
had
still
an
hour
to
spare
and
bitterly
as
he
felt
toward
helga
he
could
not
go
away
without
saying
to
her
so
he
walked
for
that
purpose
by
the
shore
road
to
the
side
door
of
the
casino
it
was
there
that
his
fate
encountered
him
as
he
was
going
into
the
casino
he
met
the
manager
who
greeted
him
effusively
ah
stephenson
they
told
me
you
were
going
away
i
m
glad
to
see
it
isn
t
true
it
is
quite
true
sir
said
oscar
why
should
you
the
season
isn
t
at
an
end
yet
but
my
money
is
said
oscar
whereupon
the
manager
laughed
put
his
arm
through
oscar
s
and
walked
back
with
him
toward
the
whispering
stephenson
i
told
you
the
house
liked
to
see
you
take
the
hank
the
game
is
good
when
you
are
in
the
chair
now
there
are
a
few
gentlemen
here
who
would
play
high
if
they
had
the
proper
inducement
don
t
go
mr
stephenson
but
i
m
penniless
don
t
you
understand
me
penniless
come
this
way
they
were
in
the
by
this
time
and
the
manager
was
drawing
oscar
toward
the
alcove
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
i
have
a
lady
to
speak
to
and
my
train
to
catch
said
oscar
listen
for
a
moment
said
the
manager
and
then
with
a
glance
toward
the
company
who
stood
absorbed
and
silent
under
the
bright
light
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
added
in
a
low
voice
stephenson
i
suggest
that
you
return
to
the
table
and
take
the
bank
when
you
call
for
counters
they
will
be
provided
if
you
lose
your
first
coup
the
loss
will
be
the
loss
of
the
house
and
if
you
win
the
gain
will
be
your
own
oscar
laughed
and
chopping
the
air
impatiently
with
a
pair
of
gloves
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
he
said
do
you
run
this
house
on
philanthropic
lines
then
hush
at
your
second
coup
you
will
call
for
fresh
cards
as
you
have
a
right
to
do
and
when
you
receive
them
you
you
will
win
you
understand
me
you
will
win
the
impatient
chopping
ceased
and
oscar
stood
looking
steadfastly
at
the
man
s
eyes
at
your
next
coup
and
your
next
you
will
call
for
cards
as
before
and
at
the
end
of
your
fourth
coup
you
will
rise
from
the
table
and
then
then
you
will
divide
your
earnings
with
the
house
and
be
richer
than
you
have
ever
been
in
your
life
oscar
had
listened
first
with
astonishment
then
with
indignation
and
finally
with
ungovernable
wrath
how
dare
you
what
do
you
take
me
for
he
said
in
a
loud
choking
voice
and
lifting
his
hand
he
smote
the
man
with
his
gloves
across
his
ruddy
and
smiling
face
the
unexpectedness
of
the
attack
compelled
the
manager
to
utter
a
startled
cry
and
in
a
moment
the
people
from
the
table
were
crowding
round
asking
what
is
it
what
s
happened
but
the
manager
recovered
himself
in
an
instant
and
said
it
s
nothing
the
gentleman
misunderstood
something
i
was
saying
to
him
i
beg
of
you
to
resume
the
play
helga
had
come
up
with
the
rest
and
when
the
others
had
returned
to
the
table
she
drew
oscar
into
the
alcove
and
said
tell
me
what
occurred
he
told
her
and
still
trembling
with
unsatisfied
anger
he
added
this
is
what
i
have
come
down
to
helga
that
a
man
can
think
it
safe
to
make
a
proposal
to
me
like
that
can
you
wonder
that
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
place
this
atmosphere
of
cheats
and
cheating
and
yet
people
talk
of
the
honor
of
the
they
might
as
well
talk
of
the
morality
of
hell
helga
was
sitting
with
her
head
down
and
her
fingers
which
sparkled
with
some
of
oscar
s
presents
interlaced
upon
her
knee
you
might
have
spared
me
one
of
these
helga
he
said
touching
her
rings
we
could
have
replaced
it
some
day
whereas
i
ve
had
to
part
with
the
watch
my
father
gave
me
and
i
can
never
replace
that
i
didn
t
want
you
to
go
oscar
that
s
why
i
didn
t
send
you
the
hundred
francs
i
didn
t
want
you
to
go
away
without
me
do
you
mean
that
helga
really
mean
it
you
do
then
come
with
me
now
i
came
to
say
but
how
can
i
leave
you
behind
in
a
place
like
this
it
will
destroy
you
as
it
has
destroyed
others
it
will
sap
away
your
health
and
spirit
and
talent
and
charm
and
everything
a
woman
wants
to
keep
helga
he
said
rising
to
his
feet
i
am
nearly
distracted
by
what
has
occurred
but
i
know
what
i
am
saying
if
you
will
throw
in
your
lot
with
me
with
me
only
i
will
devote
my
whole
life
to
your
welfare
and
do
everything
you
wish
if
there
is
anything
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
i
will
do
it
do
you
understand
me
helga
yes
oscar
then
let
us
go
back
to
london
to
our
own
world
our
own
work
helga
i
should
like
to
dearly
like
to
then
why
not
if
i
throw
in
my
lot
with
you
with
you
only
i
must
break
with
finsen
and
i
m
in
finsen
s
debt
i
know
oh
i
know
if
i
could
only
repay
him
somehow
but
i
have
nothing
you
have
your
jewels
helga
they
are
not
enough
and
besides
how
could
i
part
with
a
present
of
yours
oscar
but
if
there
were
any
other
way
of
getting
money
helga
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
am
thinking
that
if
this
is
an
atmosphere
of
cheats
and
cheating
perhaps
you
have
been
cheated
also
helga
his
voice
was
tremulous
with
protest
would
it
be
so
very
wrong
to
do
to
them
as
they
have
done
to
you
oscar
helga
helga
his
tremulous
voice
was
breaking
into
gasps
of
helplessness
i
suppose
it
would
but
how
happy
i
should
be
if
we
could
go
back
together
and
live
for
each
other
and
our
art
and
have
nothing
and
nobody
else
to
think
about
oscar
was
standing
by
her
side
and
quivering
like
a
frightened
horse
there
were
some
moments
of
silence
in
which
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
call
of
the
croupier
in
the
middle
of
the
room
then
a
waiter
went
noiselessly
by
the
mouth
of
the
alcove
carrying
an
empty
tray
to
his
own
quarters
and
by
a
sudden
impulse
in
a
thick
croupy
voice
oscar
called
to
him
garçon
my
compliments
to
the
manager
say
i
am
sorry
for
what
occurred
just
now
and
if
he
is
still
of
the
same
mind
i
will
take
the
bank
a
few
minutes
later
oscar
who
had
thrown
off
his
overcoat
and
hat
was
taking
the
banker
s
chair
at
the
the
people
seated
about
it
welcomed
him
with
nods
and
smiles
and
when
he
called
for
counters
and
received
a
huge
pile
of
ivory
ones
a
man
with
a
sinister
face
said
i
congratulate
you
sir
it
isn
t
everybody
who
can
revive
his
credit
as
quickly
as
that
what
does
it
mean
whispered
finsen
to
helga
whereupon
helga
whispered
back
don
t
ask
me
yet
and
then
she
walked
up
to
oscar
and
stood
close
behind
his
chair
there
were
a
few
strange
faces
about
the
table
including
an
english
lord
and
an
american
financier
the
manager
of
the
casino
stood
watching
from
the
back
stakes
were
high
for
the
first
coup
and
the
bank
lost
it
i
m
afraid
the
luck
is
still
against
you
sir
said
the
man
i
ll
try
again
said
oscar
fresh
cards
please
the
stakes
were
higher
for
the
second
coup
and
the
bank
won
it
that
s
better
said
the
man
another
pack
of
cards
please
said
oscar
when
the
money
was
on
the
table
for
the
third
coup
it
was
seen
to
be
double
what
it
had
been
for
the
second
the
bank
won
once
more
but
this
is
like
your
old
luck
sir
said
the
man
another
pack
cried
oscar
and
he
swept
all
his
winnings
into
the
bank
the
money
for
the
fourth
coup
was
four
times
what
it
had
been
for
the
third
the
bank
won
again
and
then
oscar
rose
from
the
table
but
aren
t
you
going
to
give
us
our
revenge
sir
asked
the
american
this
is
mine
said
oscar
as
he
left
the
chair
helga
s
face
was
quivering
with
excitement
and
delight
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
congratulated
oscar
and
she
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
kiss
him
if
you
will
step
this
way
stephenson
the
manager
s
suave
voice
was
saying
when
all
at
once
a
commotion
broke
out
behind
croupier
said
a
voice
with
a
nasal
accent
i
will
trouble
you
to
examine
them
cards
whereupon
the
manager
swung
round
with
an
aggrieved
expression
surely
sir
you
do
not
mean
to
say
to
imply
i
can
only
say
i
ll
trouble
the
croupier
to
examine
them
last
three
packs
of
cards
in
the
confusion
that
followed
finsen
came
up
to
helga
who
was
now
trembling
by
oscar
s
side
and
said
you
had
better
let
me
take
you
out
of
this
oscar
saw
helga
hesitate
then
take
one
step
away
from
him
and
stop
but
when
somebody
in
the
throng
about
the
table
cried
excitedly
the
bank
ought
to
be
impounded
he
saw
her
drop
her
head
and
follow
finsen
out
of
the
room
come
this
way
stephenson
whispered
the
manager
and
while
most
of
the
company
were
still
crowding
about
the
croupier
he
oscar
through
a
small
door
to
a
private
corridor
and
a
moment
afterward
there
was
a
roar
from
the
other
side
of
it
stay
here
leave
everything
to
me
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
said
the
manager
and
then
oscar
found
himself
alone
in
a
small
room
quite
dark
and
silent
save
for
the
glimmering
of
lamps
in
the
garden
and
the
deadened
rumble
of
the
tumult
he
had
left
behind
how
long
he
stayed
there
he
never
knew
it
seemed
like
an
hour
but
it
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
a
few
minutes
the
tumult
grew
louder
then
there
was
the
report
of
a
and
then
the
noises
frayed
off
to
silence
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
and
delirious
with
a
wild
desire
to
face
the
consequences
of
his
conduct
whatever
they
might
be
oscar
was
opening
the
door
of
his
room
when
the
manager
returned
to
it
bringing
his
hat
overcoat
and
gloves
i
ve
done
the
best
i
could
for
you
said
the
manager
panting
and
gasping
i
have
told
them
you
have
shot
yourself
and
your
friends
have
supported
that
explanation
you
must
get
away
at
once
you
must
catch
the
midnight
train
to
paris
you
ve
only
four
minutes
but
you
ll
do
it
if
you
run
here
is
a
ticket
to
london
good
night
and
remember
said
the
man
as
oscar
was
passing
through
a
private
door
to
the
garden
remember
stephenson
is
oscar
was
just
able
to
control
his
faculties
long
enough
to
reach
the
find
the
train
and
search
out
an
empty
compartment
and
then
he
collapsed
utterly
he
was
like
a
beast
that
has
been
smitten
in
the
shambles
and
is
shattered
in
every
sense
and
nerve
looking
up
at
the
lamp
in
the
roof
and
seeing
smoke
floating
above
it
he
thought
at
first
the
carriage
must
be
afire
but
looking
again
the
smoke
was
gone
and
then
he
knew
his
sight
had
suffered
and
he
supposed
he
must
be
going
blind
there
was
a
roaring
noise
in
his
ears
and
he
thought
it
was
the
roaring
of
the
train
but
when
the
train
stopped
the
noise
continued
and
then
he
knew
that
his
hearing
was
injured
and
he
supposed
he
must
be
going
deaf
two
officials
came
into
the
carriage
to
examine
the
tickets
but
though
he
saw
their
lips
moving
he
could
not
hear
what
they
said
or
rightly
grasp
what
they
wanted
until
they
were
turning
to
go
and
then
the
noise
in
his
head
slid
off
for
a
moment
and
he
heard
one
of
them
say
to
the
other
drunk
poor
devil
this
lasted
through
the
dark
hours
of
the
night
and
when
the
morning
dawned
his
experiences
were
yet
more
terrible
at
the
first
gleam
of
light
his
stunned
soul
awoke
and
with
a
sharp
pain
like
the
of
a
bullet
wound
he
realized
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
doing
he
was
flying
from
the
consequences
of
perhaps
the
most
base
and
infamous
conduct
a
man
could
be
capable
of
conduct
the
more
base
and
infamous
because
there
was
no
law
to
punish
it
low
as
he
had
sunk
hitherto
he
had
never
sunk
so
low
as
this
this
was
as
low
as
man
could
go
and
live
in
the
face
of
other
men
and
the
eye
of
the
light
and
he
had
descended
to
this
depth
he
oscar
stephenson
son
of
the
governor
of
his
country
when
he
thought
of
his
father
he
thanked
god
that
death
had
taken
him
before
this
disgrace
befell
every
artery
in
his
body
seemed
to
bleed
every
tendon
to
be
torn
when
the
sun
rose
on
him
in
his
ghastly
solitude
it
seemed
to
sere
his
very
brain
and
he
pulled
the
blind
down
to
shut
it
out
then
the
women
passengers
began
to
move
about
the
corridor
of
the
train
and
he
thought
of
helga
although
it
seemed
so
long
ago
as
almost
to
belong
to
another
existence
he
could
still
see
her
frightened
face
as
she
sidled
away
from
him
last
night
and
left
him
standing
alone
at
that
hideous
moment
when
it
seemed
certain
that
he
must
pay
the
penalty
of
the
offense
to
which
she
had
tempted
him
he
despised
her
for
her
cowardice
he
loathed
her
for
her
treachery
he
hated
her
for
herself
and
he
told
himself
that
never
again
as
long
as
he
lived
should
love
of
helga
hold
dominion
over
him
at
one
moment
he
found
himself
cursing
her
at
the
next
he
found
himself
weeping
could
it
be
helga
whom
he
was
thinking
of
like
this
helga
who
had
been
so
much
to
him
during
so
many
years
who
had
come
so
very
close
to
him
nearer
than
his
father
nearer
than
his
mother
nearer
heaven
forgive
him
than
his
wife
or
child
helga
who
had
been
with
him
early
and
late
a
soft
voice
always
at
his
ear
a
sweet
presence
always
at
his
heart
a
spirit
a
support
an
inspiration
helga
whom
he
had
loved
and
should
always
love
let
her
do
what
she
would
with
him
let
him
do
what
he
would
with
her
god
pity
him
god
help
him
yet
his
tenderness
and
tears
were
stronger
than
his
hatred
and
rage
and
he
resolved
that
for
her
perfidy
and
selfishness
helga
should
be
punished
and
that
he
should
punish
her
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
ask
himself
how
this
was
to
be
done
the
words
that
had
rumbled
in
his
ears
like
the
roll
of
a
muffled
drum
when
he
ran
from
the
gardens
of
the
casino
were
rumbling
in
his
ears
still
stephenson
is
at
first
he
could
not
be
sure
that
the
manager
had
really
spoken
them
so
exactly
did
they
echo
the
wish
that
had
been
bubbling
within
his
own
breast
but
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
indeed
and
the
words
that
might
have
crushed
him
with
shame
moved
him
more
than
a
trumpet
if
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
then
the
vow
he
had
made
in
thora
s
was
dead
also
that
vow
had
been
intended
to
punish
himself
for
his
infidelity
and
for
all
his
failures
of
love
and
duty
by
denying
himself
the
gratification
of
his
greatest
pride
the
realization
of
his
highest
hopes
but
what
pride
could
be
gratified
and
what
hopes
realized
to
oscar
stephenson
if
his
name
was
wiped
out
his
identity
lost
and
he
was
dead
to
all
the
world
except
himself
the
feverish
soul
in
its
hour
of
suffering
found
the
reasoning
sufficient
and
oscar
thought
he
saw
as
in
a
glass
everything
that
he
had
to
do
he
had
to
take
another
name
to
bury
himself
in
london
and
to
set
to
work
on
the
only
task
he
was
fit
for
he
had
to
write
an
opera
as
he
was
now
free
to
do
since
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
and
he
was
living
in
the
name
of
another
man
the
scene
was
to
be
in
his
own
country
among
the
lonesome
grandeur
of
its
untrodden
glaciers
and
the
stark
sublimity
of
its
plains
and
the
story
was
to
be
from
one
of
the
fiery
sagas
of
the
same
stern
old
land
and
when
after
many
days
many
months
perhaps
years
eating
the
bread
of
poverty
in
loneliness
and
obscurity
he
had
finished
his
task
and
had
sent
it
out
like
a
dove
from
the
ark
men
were
to
know
that
a
new
voice
had
come
among
them
and
the
name
of
iceland
was
to
be
on
the
lips
of
the
world
then
when
people
asked
each
other
who
was
he
that
in
the
darkness
of
years
of
labor
had
learned
all
the
art
and
mystery
of
music
he
would
give
no
sign
because
his
lips
would
be
sealed
but
there
would
be
one
who
would
read
his
secret
it
would
be
helga
and
she
would
come
back
to
him
in
shame
if
not
remorse
and
throw
herself
at
his
feet
and
cry
i
did
wrong
forgive
me
and
take
me
back
to
your
heart
and
then
he
would
answer
and
say
you
came
between
me
and
my
sweet
young
wife
you
persuaded
me
to
the
act
that
broke
her
heart
and
killed
her
you
tempted
me
to
the
crime
that
ruined
my
father
and
to
the
offense
that
destroyed
myself
and
then
you
left
me
to
bear
my
punishment
alone
therefore
i
have
wiped
you
out
of
my
life
i
have
cut
you
off
as
i
would
cut
off
a
rotten
limb
that
threatened
to
drag
the
whole
body
down
to
death
i
love
you
yes
i
can
never
cease
to
love
you
that
is
the
punishment
i
shall
always
bear
but
there
can
be
nothing
more
between
us
we
part
now
forever
your
course
lies
that
way
mine
this
farewell
as
the
train
rolled
along
he
found
a
delirious
joy
in
this
prospect
which
began
and
ended
with
the
idea
that
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
in
the
light
of
that
thought
he
looked
back
on
the
past
of
his
life
and
many
things
that
had
been
hard
to
understand
became
plain
again
and
again
he
had
tried
to
stop
on
his
downward
course
and
he
could
not
do
so
before
he
could
rise
out
of
the
degradation
of
his
past
life
he
had
had
to
drink
his
cup
to
the
dregs
to
go
down
to
the
depths
to
be
covered
by
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
but
at
last
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
thank
god
thank
god
how
strange
that
at
the
moment
when
helga
was
tempting
him
to
the
infamous
act
which
if
it
had
succeeded
would
have
made
him
her
slave
and
the
slave
of
sin
forever
she
was
leading
him
by
one
of
death
s
terrific
strides
to
life
and
liberty
how
mysterious
and
how
mighty
aye
and
how
cynical
also
were
the
powers
of
destiny
whose
supernatural
wings
hovered
over
the
lives
of
men
and
women
and
moved
their
little
motives
of
love
and
hate
and
revenge
and
selfishness
like
pawns
on
the
of
fate
it
was
in
this
mood
he
reached
paris
and
having
some
three
hours
to
wait
before
his
train
started
for
calais
he
walked
through
the
streets
until
he
came
to
the
center
of
the
city
and
then
sat
outside
a
café
to
eat
a
roll
of
bread
and
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
it
was
six
o
clock
and
the
were
crying
the
evening
papers
he
bought
one
to
beguile
the
time
of
waiting
and
had
not
yet
opened
it
when
he
saw
his
own
name
standing
out
from
the
front
page
as
if
it
had
been
printed
in
a
different
ink
for
some
moments
thereafter
a
mist
seemed
to
float
between
the
newspaper
and
his
eyes
but
he
read
the
paragraph
at
last
it
was
a
telegram
from
nice
headed
suicide
in
a
casino
giving
a
mangled
version
of
the
events
of
last
night
clearly
inspired
by
the
manager
to
protect
himself
and
his
house
and
closing
with
the
words
the
deceased
who
was
from
iceland
is
understood
to
be
a
son
of
the
late
of
that
country
the
paper
slipped
from
oscar
s
fingers
and
his
transport
of
rapture
passed
he
told
himself
that
this
report
would
go
far
that
it
would
reach
iceland
that
his
mother
would
hear
of
it
and
that
his
child
would
be
told
that
she
was
fatherless
little
elin
was
too
young
to
feel
grief
but
could
he
allow
his
mother
to
believe
that
he
was
dead
and
to
weep
for
him
as
for
one
who
was
lost
to
her
forever
that
would
be
too
cruel
it
would
be
impossible
he
would
write
to
his
mother
immediately
he
would
write
privately
saying
he
was
still
alive
and
that
part
of
the
report
was
untrue
but
then
came
the
chilling
thought
that
though
he
might
dispose
of
the
fiction
of
his
death
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
fact
of
his
offense
and
that
when
his
mother
pictured
him
as
one
who
was
flying
from
the
consequences
of
his
conduct
skulking
in
a
slum
and
hiding
his
face
from
the
faces
of
his
friends
there
would
be
something
in
the
shame
of
that
end
more
bitter
than
death
itself
and
even
his
own
mother
would
wish
that
he
had
died
he
had
not
thought
of
this
before
and
in
the
confusion
and
pain
of
it
he
got
up
from
the
table
at
the
café
and
began
to
walk
the
streets
again
after
a
while
he
found
himself
ascending
the
steps
of
the
madeline
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
except
that
he
was
trying
to
pass
the
time
by
following
a
stream
of
people
into
the
building
it
was
the
hour
of
benediction
the
most
beautiful
the
most
tender
the
most
moving
of
all
the
offices
of
the
catholic
church
the
congregation
were
chiefly
women
and
among
ladies
in
silks
whose
carriages
stood
outside
were
some
from
the
round
the
corner
for
there
is
only
one
caste
in
the
commune
of
the
cross
one
poor
woman
who
took
a
chair
and
knelt
close
beside
oscar
had
the
sad
and
face
that
the
cross
draws
to
it
in
every
church
in
the
country
for
its
empire
is
the
empire
of
the
oppressed
and
bereaved
and
mother
thought
oscar
as
she
crossed
herself
and
sighed
but
when
she
raised
her
weary
eyes
to
the
figure
of
the
above
the
altar
her
sad
face
softened
and
smiled
and
it
was
almost
as
if
an
angel
had
come
down
and
whispered
to
her
then
as
the
sweet
music
swelled
through
the
great
church
the
hard
lump
rose
to
oscar
s
throat
and
thinking
of
his
own
mother
so
far
away
he
told
himself
that
if
she
believed
he
was
really
dead
the
angel
of
death
would
comfort
her
his
faults
would
be
forgiven
his
errors
would
be
forgotten
and
the
dust
of
death
would
cover
all
his
transgressions
she
would
be
happier
in
his
death
than
she
had
ever
been
in
his
life
and
though
it
was
a
sore
thing
to
think
of
that
the
pain
would
be
his
not
hers
and
her
poor
heart
would
be
at
ease
he
thought
of
magnus
too
how
his
hatred
would
be
appeased
when
he
heard
that
his
brother
was
dead
and
all
the
flames
of
his
rage
extinguished
then
he
thought
of
his
enemies
at
home
how
they
would
cease
to
revile
him
and
how
he
would
pass
out
of
shame
reproach
and
contempt
into
the
charity
of
silence
and
the
peace
of
forgetfulness
finally
he
thought
of
his
little
elin
his
sweet
motherless
daughter
how
she
would
hear
no
more
hard
words
spoken
of
her
father
but
would
grow
up
to
think
of
him
merely
as
one
who
had
died
early
oh
blessed
and
merciful
death
which
can
make
those
who
hate
us
hate
us
less
and
those
who
love
us
love
us
more
it
was
bitter
to
comfort
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
dead
dead
in
disgrace
and
in
a
foreign
country
with
no
mother
s
tears
falling
on
his
face
and
no
child
weeping
by
his
side
that
tragic
consolation
of
the
dying
but
just
at
that
moment
the
music
ceased
the
bell
tinkled
at
the
altar
and
raising
his
eyes
as
the
priest
elevated
the
host
the
awe
deepened
about
him
and
he
told
himself
that
it
was
not
he
who
was
dead
at
all
but
only
his
sin
and
misery
and
that
he
might
rise
if
he
would
out
of
the
shadow
of
death
into
another
and
better
life
then
almost
before
he
knew
it
the
thought
had
become
a
prayer
and
he
found
himself
praying
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
begin
again
to
put
the
past
behind
him
and
to
think
of
the
lost
days
of
his
life
hitherto
as
seed
that
was
not
dead
though
he
had
trampled
it
into
the
clay
out
of
the
heart
came
the
only
songs
that
went
to
the
heart
and
out
of
his
shame
and
suffering
in
that
future
he
had
foreshadowed
for
himself
the
voice
might
come
that
would
speak
to
other
souls
as
stained
with
sin
as
his
yet
who
was
he
to
speak
to
any
one
only
a
prodigal
in
a
far
country
who
had
wasted
his
substance
in
riotous
living
and
having
come
to
himself
at
last
now
that
no
man
would
give
to
him
was
turning
his
eyes
homeward
and
crying
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
before
thee
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
the
service
came
to
an
end
and
the
people
rose
to
go
as
oscar
rose
too
he
told
himself
that
in
actual
fact
he
would
go
back
home
some
day
a
little
longer
only
a
little
longer
and
he
would
return
to
iceland
his
father
would
be
gone
yes
his
poor
father
would
be
gone
but
his
mother
would
be
there
and
he
would
make
amends
to
her
for
everything
she
had
suffered
for
his
sake
and
wipe
all
tears
from
her
eyes
his
child
would
be
there
also
and
he
would
claim
her
as
he
had
always
intended
to
do
and
though
she
might
not
even
know
his
face
she
would
hear
the
voice
of
nature
calling
her
and
she
would
come
to
him
and
he
would
be
a
father
to
her
guiding
and
protecting
her
and
she
would
be
a
daughter
to
him
cheering
and
comforting
him
and
her
love
would
be
his
solace
for
all
the
pains
of
life
a
little
longer
only
a
little
longer
when
he
came
out
of
the
great
church
he
felt
himself
lifted
into
a
purer
air
where
he
was
no
longer
a
fugitive
from
the
vengeance
of
his
but
a
pardoned
soul
born
again
in
a
blessed
resurrection
and
when
he
had
settled
in
the
train
for
calais
he
set
himself
to
consider
what
other
name
he
should
be
known
by
in
that
new
existence
which
he
had
just
begun
it
had
to
be
a
name
that
would
sufficiently
conceal
his
own
yet
one
that
would
be
characteristic
of
his
country
and
after
much
beating
of
the
wings
of
memory
he
decided
on
christian
christiansson
as
a
name
which
not
only
answered
to
the
conditions
but
possessed
an
added
nobleness
of
meaning
and
associations
that
would
forever
forbid
the
lowering
of
the
flag
of
his
purpose
but
after
he
had
concluded
that
christian
christiansson
was
to
be
his
name
in
the
future
it
cost
him
a
pang
to
think
that
oscar
stephenson
was
to
be
his
name
no
longer
stephen
had
been
his
father
s
name
and
his
poor
father
had
expected
him
to
carry
it
on
from
strength
to
strength
and
from
glory
to
glory
oscar
had
been
the
name
his
mother
had
known
him
by
and
it
came
back
to
him
now
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
with
the
happiest
memories
of
his
boyhood
he
could
hear
it
in
thora
s
voice
also
in
the
tremulous
happiness
of
her
bridal
chamber
in
the
tender
joy
of
her
motherhood
and
in
the
pleading
accents
of
her
despair
it
was
like
burying
something
of
himself
to
bury
his
name
but
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
and
that
name
could
be
his
no
more
it
was
early
morning
when
he
reached
london
and
returning
to
it
after
six
months
absence
he
felt
like
one
who
had
been
dead
and
was
alive
again
as
the
empty
streets
echoed
to
his
footsteps
his
spirits
rose
and
he
looked
to
the
future
without
fear
though
he
was
coming
back
friendless
and
nearly
penniless
he
saw
himself
as
he
would
be
some
day
christian
christiansson
the
composer
rich
respected
honored
perhaps
and
perhaps
beloved
it
might
be
months
it
might
be
years
but
god
willing
it
should
come
a
little
longer
only
a
little
longer
he
had
at
first
intended
to
look
for
a
lodging
where
he
would
be
quite
unknown
but
in
his
present
elevation
of
feeling
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
do
so
and
he
determined
to
return
to
his
old
home
in
short
street
when
he
came
to
westminster
bridge
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
down
at
the
houseless
wretches
who
were
still
asleep
on
the
benches
of
the
embankment
and
to
remember
the
night
when
he
had
been
one
of
them
and
to
think
of
the
other
night
that
was
soon
to
come
when
the
of
his
new
life
would
be
in
his
hands
he
could
see
it
all
as
in
a
glass
that
revealed
the
future
the
curtain
would
be
down
on
the
new
opera
and
there
would
be
a
great
demonstration
in
the
crowded
again
and
again
the
singers
would
be
recalled
and
then
there
would
be
loud
cries
for
the
composer
the
cries
would
rise
to
a
deafening
clamor
and
the
whole
audience
from
the
royal
box
to
the
gallery
would
be
calling
for
the
unknown
man
who
had
breathed
his
suffering
soul
into
an
old
saga
and
made
the
dry
bones
live
but
the
unknown
would
not
appear
he
would
not
be
there
where
would
he
be
he
would
be
down
here
here
under
the
night
sky
weeping
for
joy
and
gratitude
emptying
his
pockets
among
these
homeless
outcasts
in
memory
of
the
night
when
he
too
was
homeless
and
an
outcast
and
vowing
never
again
to
forget
the
friendless
and
the
fallen
or
to
be
hard
on
the
sinner
and
the
prodigal
he
could
see
it
happening
as
plainly
as
if
it
had
already
come
to
pass
it
come
to
pass
a
little
longer
only
a
little
longer
when
he
reached
short
street
the
hearse
of
the
necropolis
had
just
turned
the
corner
and
was
rattling
up
the
archway
nearly
all
the
of
number
one
were
still
down
but
as
he
hesitated
at
the
foot
of
the
front
steps
the
door
opened
and
a
young
woman
in
curl
papers
came
out
with
a
mop
and
pail
she
stared
at
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
stranger
but
he
knew
her
instantly
don
t
you
remember
me
jenny
he
said
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
jenny
s
face
assumed
a
look
of
bewilderment
this
was
followed
by
a
smile
of
recognition

jack
jenny
went
scurrying
down
the
stairs
like
an
old
slipper
and
oscar
stepped
into
the
barman
s
parlor
and
sat
on
the
shiny
sofa
he
remembered
that
he
had
sat
there
before
he
remembered
who
had
sat
with
him
he
remembered
all
that
had
happened
since
and
then
for
one
brief
moment
his
visions
of
the
future
failed
him
his
hopes
and
intentions
sank
away
everything
was
blotted
out
except
the
sweet
and
bitter
memory
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
lost
and
he
broke
down
utterly
it
takes
a
long
time
for
the
truth
to
travel
from
a
distance
but
a
lie
flies
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
the
report
of
oscar
s
death
in
a
on
the
riviera
reached
iceland
by
the
next
steamer
three
days
before
the
steamer
s
arrival
magnus
and
his
mother
were
sitting
in
front
of
their
farm
at
thingvellir
anna
was
spinning
and
magnus
was
making
rope
by
a
twister
turned
by
a
small
boy
a
dozen
yards
away
for
it
was
just
after
the
and
a
little
before
the
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
crags
of
the
almanagja
the
blueberry
ling
was
reddening
over
the
green
waters
of
the
chasm
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
evening
air
save
the
plash
of
the
axe
waterfall
the
lowing
of
kine
and
the
cry
of
curlew
then
over
the
hum
of
the
wheel
and
the
of
the
twister
came
the
dull
thud
of
horses
feet
on
that
hollow
ground
and
anna
stopped
to
listen
that
must
be
the
post
coming
she
said
and
magnus
answered
perhaps
without
turning
to
look
at
the
road
which
was
still
empty
as
far
as
to
the
top
of
the
cleft
where
it
opened
on
to
the
plain
i
wonder
if
there
will
be
a
letter
from
oscar
why
should
you
wonder
mother
has
he
answered
your
letter
of
three
years
ago
has
he
had
the
decency
and
humanity
to
reply
to
the
news
of
his
father
s
death
no
still
i
can
not
give
up
hoping
he
must
know
by
this
time
how
you
are
placed
with
the
farm
and
perhaps
he
is
only
waiting
until
he
can
send
you
some
assistance
magnus
made
no
reply
but
the
of
the
rope
was
louder
it
s
true
he
doesn
t
know
everything
he
doesn
t
know
that
his
father
left
nothing
behind
him
but
the
debt
to
the
bank
and
that
the
bank
has
been
so
hard
mother
if
you
go
on
talking
like
that
i
shall
never
get
this
rope
finished
i
don
t
want
anybody
to
help
me
to
pay
my
way
and
the
bank
shall
have
its
money
every
christmas
if
hard
work
can
make
it
you
ll
work
yourself
to
death
that
s
what
you
ll
do
magnus
you
sent
asher
away
in
the
winter
although
he
was
so
good
at
feeding
the
beasts
when
the
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
now
that
the
hay
has
to
be
cut
and
the
lambs
killed
you
re
discharging
jon
vidalin
we
ll
have
to
thin
down
somewhere
and
the
sooner
we
begin
the
better
it
s
too
late
to
spare
when
you
see
the
bottom
of
the
you
know
that
s
what
you
call
thinning
down
sending
everybody
away
who
can
help
you
with
the
farm
and
keeping
a
houseful
of
women
who
are
of
no
use
for
anything
why
which
of
them
is
of
no
use
mother
gudrun
for
one
she
only
milks
the
cows
in
the
morning
and
the
ewes
in
the
evening
and
i
could
do
both
myself
and
save
her
keep
and
wages
nonsense
mother
you
re
not
young
enough
now
to
get
up
at
four
o
clock
winter
and
summer
and
i
won
t
hear
of
it
for
a
moment
then
there
s
maria
old
enough
for
anything
and
what
s
the
use
of
her
maria
s
been
in
the
family
since
before
i
was
born
and
we
can
t
turn
her
away
now
because
she
s
old
and
rheumatic
and
here
s
eric
said
anna
dropping
her
voice
and
glancing
at
the
boy
who
was
turning
the
twister
eric
poor
little
chap
he
s
lost
his
father
and
he
only
gets
a
lamb
for
his
wages
anyway
it
s
to
be
a
sheep
this
year
remember
and
then
there
s
his
food
but
if
it
s
an
orphanage
you
want
to
keep
or
a
home
for
invalids
helloa
here
s
the
post
and
who
s
this
he
has
got
with
him
the
rector
the
rector
and
two
strangers
cried
magnus
as
a
wagon
drawn
by
four
ponies
rumbled
over
the
bridge
above
the
waterfall
and
galloped
up
to
the
welcome
rector
said
anna
thanks
anna
these
are
friends
from
america
traveling
to
see
the
country
we
should
like
to
sleep
here
and
go
on
to
geyser
in
the
morning
with
pleasure
maria
gudrun
jon
vidalin
cried
anna
and
while
the
strangers
were
being
taken
to
the
and
the
horses
to
the
stable
the
rector
went
indoors
with
anna
and
magnus
and
they
sat
and
talked
around
the
hall
table
you
look
hale
in
spite
of
everything
anna
and
you
too
rector
ah
yes
old
wood
burns
slow
but
i
sometimes
wonder
if
it
s
well
to
live
long
better
go
to
bed
early
than
sit
up
too
late
i
say
any
new
trouble
in
town
lately
the
factor
is
down
at
last
poor
fellow
you
mean
that
he
s
bankrupt
and
about
to
be
sold
up
business
office
everything
poor
margret
neilsen
what
about
the
child
asked
magnus
i
think
he
would
part
with
it
now
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
is
feeling
bitterly
about
oscar
just
at
present
a
dove
doesn
t
come
out
of
a
raven
s
egg
he
said
yesterday
he
said
that
so
the
new
minister
says
but
then
it
was
the
minister
who
made
him
bankrupt
but
i
thought
they
were
such
friends
and
when
poor
stephen
was
petitioning
the
king
then
you
haven
t
heard
what
happened
about
thora
thora
said
magnus
poor
thora
s
grave
i
mean
it
makes
the
blood
run
between
my
skin
and
my
flesh
to
think
about
it
tell
us
said
anna
and
then
the
rector
told
them
how
the
minister
acting
under
instructions
received
from
abroad
had
ordered
thora
s
grave
to
be
opened
and
certain
musical
compositions
which
had
been
buried
in
it
to
be
taken
out
how
this
had
been
done
and
the
papers
despatched
to
england
how
the
factor
had
heard
of
it
and
being
furious
had
threatened
an
action
against
the
minister
and
finally
how
the
minister
to
cut
the
ground
under
the
factor
s
feet
had
caused
the
bank
to
make
him
a
bankrupt
during
the
progress
of
the
rector
s
story
magnus
sat
without
saying
a
word
but
every
moment
his
cheeks
grew
whiter
and
his
eyes
glared
and
his
lips
quivered
meantime
anna
covered
her
face
and
said
it
must
have
been
neils
who
did
that
i
never
liked
the
boy
he
was
always
too
much
like
his
father
and
now
that
he
is
it
wasn
t
neils
anna
it
was
oscar
oscar
said
magnus
and
his
hands
clutched
the
corners
of
the
table
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
couldn
t
have
believed
it
of
oscar
but
who
knows
how
he
may
have
been
tempted
perhaps
he
was
poor
yes
perhaps
after
all
he
was
in
want
and
they
offered
him
money
there
are
such
ups
and
downs
in
these
foreign
countries
perhaps
he
was
starving
in
the
streets
of
london
he
wasn
t
in
london
at
all
anna
he
was
at
monte
carlo
or
nice
or
somewhere
then
you
mean
he
only
wanted
the
money
to
the
same
as
before
when
he
i
won
t
believe
it
be
quiet
mother
said
magnus
with
the
hoarse
croak
of
a
raven
and
then
turning
to
the
rector
who
did
it
the
work
itself
i
mean
hans
the
sailor
they
could
get
nobody
else
it
seems
hans
the
sailor
repeated
magnus
in
the
same
hoarse
croak
and
while
the
table
creaked
under
the
clutch
of
his
great
hands
his
face
grew
hard
and
ugly
during
the
remainder
of
that
day
magnus
went
about
without
speaking
to
any
one
and
next
morning
after
the
strangers
had
started
on
their
journey
he
saddled
silvertop
and
rode
off
toward
reykjavik
anna
saw
him
go
and
calling
to
jon
vidalin
she
said
take
the
fastest
horse
and
ride
to
town
by
the
low
road
and
find
hans
the
sailor
tell
him
to
fly
before
magnus
comes
and
never
to
come
back
again
when
magnus
returned
to
the
farm
three
days
afterward
he
was
like
another
man
his
face
was
no
longer
hard
and
ugly
it
was
as
soft
as
a
tender
woman
s
and
he
was
smiling
down
at
something
that
looked
like
a
huge
bundle
which
he
carried
on
the
saddle
in
front
of
him
anna
saw
him
crossing
the
bridge
and
she
ran
out
to
meet
him
goodness
me
she
cried
is
it
the
child
yes
it
is
the
child
mother
said
magnus
and
out
of
a
mountain
of
rugs
and
shawls
came
little
elin
now
in
her
fifth
year
and
she
was
dropped
into
anna
s
arms
the
darling
what
a
great
girl
she
has
grown
so
she
has
come
to
see
her
gran
ma
yes
gran
ma
said
the
child
and
here
are
her
clothes
all
of
them
said
magnus
swinging
a
satchel
off
his
shoulders
then
she
has
come
for
good
and
she
is
going
to
live
with
her
gran
ma
and
uncle
magnus
and
silvertop
and
the
sheeps
and
the
doggies
said
the
little
one
so
she
shall
bless
her
jon
vidalin

to
the
master
s
pony
eric
where

ah
that

a
good
boy

the
satchel
into
the
house
maria
did
you
see
anything
so
bonny
but
magnus
how
ever
did
the
factor
come
to
part
with
her
he
wouldn
t
at
first
for
all
his
worries
and
the
hard
things
he
had
been
saying
and
when
he
came
to
it
at
last
he
wanted
me
to
promise
that
if
margret
neilsen
died
before
himself
he
should
have
the
child
back
again
you
didn
t
agree
to
that
magnus
i
said
the
girl
should
choose
for
herself
if
she
was
old
enough
and
at
last
he
consented
but
what
about
margret
neilsen
that
was
harder
still
i
promised
her
mother
i
should
keep
her
as
long
as
i
lived
she
said
ah
poor
thing
she
didn
t
know
what
was
to
happen
i
wouldn
t
part
with
her
to
anybody
in
the
world
hut
anna
she
said
i
always
said
margret
neilsen
was
as
good
as
gold
and
i
wouldn
t
part
with
her
now
she
said
only
anna
is
in
such
trouble
give
the
child
to
maria
and
come
into
the
house
mother
the
sunshine
died
off
anna
s
face
she
saw
what
was
coming
here
take
her
in
and
give
her
some
barley
cake
and
syrup
and
for
goodness
sake
woman
don
t
sniffle
as
if
you
had
a
cold
what
is
it
magnus

i
the
only
one
who
doesn
t
know
tell
me
plainly
is
he
in
disgrace
again
have
courage
mother
said
magnus
she
looked
at
him
and
understood
everything
wait
she
said
and
she
went
down
on
her
knees
in
the
hall
and
prayed
for
some
moments
after
that
she
got
up
pale
but
calm
and
said
now
tell
me
everything
i
am
ready
magnus
told
her
what
he
had
heard
and
all
that
had
happened
how
he
had
gone
to
town
with
murder
in
his
heart
intending
to
punish
hans
the
sailor
how
some
one
had
warned
him
and
hans
had
taken
refuge
in
a
schooner
that
was
to
sail
for
norway
how
he
had
hired
a
boat
to
follow
the
man
when
the
mail
steamer
dropped
anchor
in
the
bay
and
somebody
shouted
from
the
deck
that
oscar
was
dead
and
it
was
the
same
as
if
a
hand
from
heaven
had
stopped
him
dead
did
he
say
dead
in
france
he
said
and
he
threw
down
a
danish
newspaper
here
it
is
mother
but
god
knows
if
i
should
read
you
the
report
in
it
read
it
said
anna
he
read
it
it
was
the
same
which
had
appeared
in
paris
and
she
listened
without
drawing
breath
then
he
died
in
a
by
his
own
hand
too
and
to
save
himself
from
further
disgrace
magnus
did
not
attempt
to
speak
and
presently
anna
s
tears
began
to
flow
after
a
few
moments
she
wept
bitterly
and
prayed
aloud
now
for
oscar
that
god
would
forgive
him
now
for
elin
that
god
would
protect
the
little
orphan
finally
for
herself
that
god
would
have
pity
upon
her
and
let
her
die
magnus
went
over
to
the
dresser
for
a
bowl
dipped
it
in
the
and
gave
her
a
drink
and
after
that
she
seemed
better
my
poor
oscar
she
said
he
wasted
his
life
poor
boy
such
a
precious
life
too
such
talents
there
wasn
t
anything
he
couldn
t
master
everybody
said
what
great
things
he
would
do
some
day
and
to
think
it
should
come
to
this
i
never
expected
to
thank
god
that
his
father
was
dead
but
i
do
now
oh
god
i
thank
thee
but
what
am
i
saying
after
a
few
minutes
more
she
began
to
blame
herself
for
everything
that
had
happened
i
didn
t
bring
him
up
properly
i
could
never
be
strict
with
children
and
he
was
always
so
sweet
and
even
when
he
was
naughty
he
was
so
loving
everybody
loved
that
child
yes
it
was
my
fault
and
god
ought
to
punish
me
almighty
father
be
merciful
to
my
poor
boy
and
if
i
was
to
blame
mother
mother
said
magnus
and
she
stopped
in
her
waiting
for
a
loving
word
to
comfort
and
support
her
but
magnus
said
no
more
a
few
minutes
later
all
she
had
suffered
at
oscar
s
hands
was
wiped
out
of
her
mind
and
the
wayward
sinner
had
become
a
saint
he
never
changed
to
me
never
and
even
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
he
always
kissed
me
going
to
bed
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
was
a
boy
he
was
so
good
to
his
mother
both
my
sons
have
been
good
to
me
no
mother
ever
had
such
good
sons
mother
said
magnus
and
again
she
waited
but
magnus
did
not
speak
at
length
she
checked
her
tears
and
began
to
comfort
herself
with
the
thought
that
if
oscar
had
taken
his
own
life
it
must
have
been
in
madness
therefore
god
would
not
hold
him
accountable
and
if
he
died
in
disgrace
perhaps
it
was
only
because
he
wanted
to
come
back
rich
so
that
he
could
pay
the
mortgage
and
make
us
all
happy
i
used
to
think
of
that
and
pray
for
it
so
often
but
now
if
he
could
only
come
back
poor
i
shouldn
t
care
how
poor
as
poor
as
the
prodigal
in
the
parable
mother
cried
magnus
i
can
t
hear
you
talk
like
this
i
can
t
and
i
won
t
oscar
is
dead
but
he
treated
you
shamefully
don
t
say
that
magnus
but
i
do
say
it
i
say
you
were
the
best
mother
to
him
a
son
ever
had
and
the
only
return
he
made
to
you
for
your
care
and
was
to
neglect
you
and
forget
you
don
t
say
it
my
son
i
will
say
it
mother
and
i
ll
say
too
that
oscar
lived
in
disgrace
and
died
in
disgrace
and
now
that
he
is
gone
i
am
not
going
to
pretend
that
i
wish
he
could
come
back
again
magnus
magnus
i
don
t
wish
it
if
he
came
back
poor
what
right
would
he
have
to
bring
his
poverty
here
and
if
he
came
back
rich
what
reason
to
expect
that
his
money
would
make
amends
to
us
for
the
evil
days
we
have
had
through
him
i
don
t
believe
in
the
return
of
the
prodigal
mother
and
i
don
t
believe
in
the
parable
either
that
may
be
the
way
in
the
other
world
but
it
isn
t
the
way
in
this
one
and
it
shouldn
t
be
i
say
it
shouldn
t
be
oh
dear
oh
dear
as
for
oscar
i
tried
to
forgive
him
you
know
i
did
but
there
are
some
crimes
that
seem
to
be
past
forgiveness
and
when
i
think
of
this
last
one
against
thora
i
m
not
sorry
he
never
came
back
i
shouldn
t
have
been
able
to
keep
my
hands
off
him
i
was
thinking
of
him
when
i
was
following
hans
and
if
he
had
returned
with
the
ship
that
brought
the
news
of
his
death
it
would
have
been
god
help
both
him
and
me
but
my
son
your
brother
is
only
just
dead
and
it
is
your
duty
to
forgive
him
whatever
he
he
died
to
me
long
ago
mother
before
he
went
away
from
iceland
and
now
that
he
is
dead
indeed
i
thank
god
he
can
never
come
back
again
well
the
lord
knows
best
what
he
is
doing
said
anna
and
then
her
tears
came
again
whereupon
magnus
seeing
what
he
had
done
walked
over
to
her
and
kissed
her
he
had
never
done
that
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
before
so
her
tears
flowed
faster
than
ever
and
then
he
went
out
of
the
house
muttering
to
himself
ah
well
my
god
my
god
that
night
when
the
bell
in
the
hall
rang
for
prayers
and
little
elin
sat
in
her
grandmother
s
lap
and
the
trooped
in
with
the
awesome
looks
of
persons
who
knew
what
shadow
hung
over
the
little
house
among
the
lonely
hills
magnus
in
his
quality
of
family
priest
took
up
the
bible
and
at
the
place
where
anna
opened
for
him
the
chapter
was
from
second
samuel
and
it
ended
with
the
verse
and
the
king
was
much
moved
and
went
up
to
the
chamber
over
the
gate
and
wept
and
as
he
went
thus
he
said
o
my
son
absalom
my
son
my
son
absalom
would
god
i
had
died
for
thee
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
the
hymn
was
meek
and
low
meek
and
low
i
shall
soon
my
jesus
know
when
the
singing
ended
the
went
out
one
by
one
each
saying
to
magnus
god
give
you
a
good
night
and
magnus
answered
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
emotion
that
mastered
him
and
you
and
you
in
the
house
of
sorrow
god
closes
the
hearts
of
little
children
so
that
they
may
not
break
little
elin
had
been
bright
and
happy
the
whole
evening
through
she
was
a
merry
little
sprite
whose
laughter
like
the
rippling
of
a
sunny
stream
set
everybody
else
laughing
old
maria
was
at
a
loss
to
say
which
of
her
parents
she
resembled
most
when
the
child
laughed
maria
said
there
s
a
deal
of
the
father
in
the
little
one
and
when
she
listened
and
looked
up
sideways
maria
thought
there
was
a
deal
of
the
mother
too
anna
put
her
to
bed
and
while
she
was
being
undressed
her
little
tongue
went
like
a
shuttle
existence
had
gone
rapidly
since
she
arrived
and
she
was
full
of
stories
how
she
had
gone
to
the
chasm
with
maria
to
pluck
blueberries
and
two
big
black
ravens
sitting
on
a
crag
had
looked
down
at
her
and
croaked
how
she
had
gone
to
the
with
eric
to
see
the
cows
milked
and
gudrun
to
her
infinite
glee
had
squirted
some
of
the
milk
at
her
and
above
all
how
all
alone
she
had
found
a
pet
lamb
and
it
was
brown
because
it
had
lost
its
mother
and
lived
in
the
because
its
father
had
run
away
from
it
and
how
it
put
its
cold
nose
against
her
face
and
said
bah
and
its
name
was
maggie
maggie
shall
come
and
waken
you
in
the
morning
darling
said
anna
shall
she
come
in
here
gran
ma
yes
dear
said
anna
and
then
the
sunny
stream
of
the
child
s
laughter
rippled
through
the
room
but
now
it
s
late
and
good
little
girls
must
be
as
quiet
as
mice
yes
gran
ma
in
a
breathless
whisper

is

made
it
nice
so
that

wall

guitar
and

play

day

the
whisper

growing
a
little
weary
the
next
room

the
and
uncle
magnus
always
sleeps
there
except
when
there
are
strangers
so
if

night

the
whisper

a
good
girl
to
uncle
magnus
he
loved
your
dear
sweet
mother

but
he
lost

burst
of
wakefulness

mother

only

given

whisper

moment
in
annihilation
s
moment
of
the
well
of
life
to
taste
stars
are
setting
and
the
to
the
dawn
of
nothing
oh
make
haste
the
danish
laura
outward
bound
on
her
midwinter
trip
from
copenhagen
to
leith
and
from
leith
to
iceland
carried
two
saloon
passengers
only
one
of
these
a
comfortable
elderly
person
of
ample
proportions
dressed
in
the
warmest
icelandic
vadmal
was
an
iceland
merchant
returning
from
edinburgh
with
a
hundred
tons
of
british
produce
this
was
jon
oddsson
formerly
radical
champion
in
politics
and
now
conservative
leader
in
trade
the
other
passenger
was
a
tall
spare
man
apparently
about
fifty
years
of
age
with
large
and
luminous
but
weary
eyes
long
pale
cheeks
deeply
scored
with
lines
of
thought
and
a
pointed
beard
that
was
beginning
to
be
tinged
with
grey
this
was
christian
christiansson
now
ten
years
older
than
when
he
returned
from
the
riviera
to
london
and
so
changed
in
every
feature
by
the
strange
characters
which
work
and
sorrow
inscribe
on
a
man
s
face
with
the
stern
hand
of
time
that
few
or
none
would
have
recognized
him
in
the
interval
christian
christiansson
had
carried
out
his
plans
and
realized
his
expectations
buried
in
the
depths
of
london
as
a
man
dying
on
shipboard
is
buried
in
the
vast
grave
of
the
sea
he
had
lived
long
as
one
who
was
dead
but
his
hour
had
struck
at
last
for
five
years
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
popular
of
living
composers
his
operas
founded
on
the
sagas
of
his
own
country
had
made
iceland
familiar
to
people
everywhere
his
works
had
been
represented
in
every
capital
his
tunes
had
been
played
in
every
street
and
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
breathed
over
europe
and
set
the
air
to
song
meantime
he
had
been
faithful
to
the
pledge
he
had
made
with
himself
his
name
was
a
household
word
but
it
was
no
more
than
a
name
and
his
identity
had
never
been
revealed
no
temptation
had
prevailed
with
him
to
disclose
it
and
the
few
who
knew
his
secret
had
found
it
to
their
interest
to
maintain
the
mystery
and
now
he
was
returning
to
his
own
country
rich
and
famous
rich
as
the
man
who
strikes
ore
from
the
rock
and
finds
it
pouring
down
on
him
in
an
avalanche
of
gold
but
famous
only
as
the
hidden
folk
are
famous
the
good
fairies
who
leave
food
and
drink
at
the
doors
of
poor
men
and
then
steal
away
before
they
awake
in
the
dawn
how
changed
the
old
world
was
when
he
emerged
at
length
into
the
light
of
open
day
the
telegram
he
sent
from
london
asking
for
a
berth
to
be
reserved
for
him
had
almost
paralyzed
the
captain
with
excitement
and
delight
it
was
the
same
old
captain
zimsen
who
in
former
days
had
given
him
the
best
room
when
he
was
in
favor
and
the
worst
when
he
was
in
disgrace
the
moment
he
set
foot
on
the
ship
lying
in
dock
at
leith
the
old
salt
had
been
there
hat
in
hand
to
lead
him
to
his
private
cabin
do
me
the
honor
to
occupy
my
stateroom
sir
and
if
there
is
anything
you
could
wish
any
little
dainty
for
the
table
you
are
very
good
very
obliging
don
t
mention
it
sir
it
is
a
pleasure
a
privilege
to
do
anything
in
my
power
for
the
most
distinguished
icelander
of
modern
times
do
they
know
you
are
coming
mr
christiansson
not
yet
captain
what
a
pity
what
a
reception
they
would
have
given
you
but
they
will
they
will
if
the
world
was
changed
the
man
was
changed
also
the
buoyancy
of
youth
was
gone
and
over
the
old
captivating
gaiety
of
manner
and
expression
a
sad
gravity
had
fallen
as
if
a
still
bright
with
blossom
had
been
borne
down
by
snow
but
after
two
days
at
sea
his
spirits
rose
and
he
felt
like
a
slave
who
had
been
emancipated
like
a
prisoner
set
free
it
was
fifteen
years
since
he
had
left
his
own
country
but
he
was
returning
to
it
at
last
as
he
had
always
hoped
and
intended
to
do
he
had
left
it
in
disgrace
he
was
going
back
to
it
in
honor
he
had
left
it
in
poverty
he
was
going
back
to
it
with
wealth
he
was
going
back
as
the
prodigal
yet
not
like
the
prodigal
and
ashamed
but
able
to
make
amends
and
to
wipe
the
tears
from
all
eyes
would
it
be
wrong
to
permit
himself
to
be
known
if
the
people
of
iceland
more
observant
than
this
old
captain
identified
in
christian
christiansson
the
oscar
stephenson
who
was
thought
to
be
dead
would
it
be
false
to
the
pledge
he
had
made
with
himself
to
submit
to
their
recognition
fifteen
years
he
had
lived
in
obscurity
was
it
not
enough
for
penance
and
pardon
were
not
the
doors
of
his
dungeon
even
yet
broken
open
could
he
not
believe
that
he
was
delivered
from
the
body
of
the
death
he
had
lived
in
he
had
lived
he
had
died
might
he
not
live
again
during
the
ten
years
in
which
he
had
been
as
a
dead
man
all
channels
of
communication
had
been
closed
to
him
and
except
for
information
casually
gathered
he
had
little
or
no
knowledge
of
what
had
occurred
in
iceland
and
now
finding
himself
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
men
who
had
been
in
constant
touch
with
his
people
he
had
a
hundred
questions
which
he
yearned
to
ask
is
my
mother
alive
is
she
well
and
my
little
daughter
has
god
been
good
to
me
and
let
her
live
or
is
all
my
labor
wasted
but
he
was
afraid
to
learn
the
truth
too
suddenly
so
he
waited
and
watched
and
listened
for
answers
to
the
questions
he
dared
not
ask
meantime
he
tried
to
amuse
himself
with
the
curiosity
of
the
captain
and
his
who
were
clearly
at
a
loss
to
know
who
he
was
where
he
was
born
and
what
family
of
the
christianssons
he
came
from
it
was
a
perilous
pleasure
a
dizzy
joy
to
listen
to
the
names
of
his
family
and
to
hear
himself
discussed
and
sometimes
in
mortal
shame
of
the
subterfuges
to
which
his
disguise
condemned
him
he
could
hardly
resist
an
impulse
to
blurt
out
the
truth
of
his
identity
and
sometimes
he
had
to
leap
up
from
his
place
in
the
and
fly
you
ve
not
been
home
very
lately
mr
christiansson
said
the
captain
who
was
smoking
his
long
pipe
after
dinner
while
the
ship
swung
along
in
open
sea
not
very
lately
captain
said
christiansson
you
ll
see
changes
then
said
the
merchant
no
doubt
no
doubt
the
new
constitution
has
worked
wonders
for
iceland
sir
worked
wonders
has
it
the
barter
trade
has
gone
the
cash
business
is
established
everywhere
and
as
for
the
fishing
it
s
another
industry
sir
another
industry
is
it
judge
for
yourself
sir
instead
of
the
old
open
boats
we
have
sixty
smacks
manned
by
twenty
men
apiece
and
going
as
far
as
six
days
out
and
home
again
then
the
people
were
right
after
all
who
used
to
say
the
old
trade
was
doomed
and
the
water
was
to
be
the
wealth
of
iceland
they
were
that
sir
said
the
merchant
inflating
his
chest
and
pulling
down
his
waistcoat
everybody
has
benefited
by
the
change
and
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
you
find
your
own
people
better
off
than
when
you
left
them
that
is
to
say
if
they
are
still
alive
if
they
re
still
alive
said
christian
christiansson
dropping
both
voice
and
eyes
by
the
way
were
you
at
home
in
governor
stephen
s
time
mr
christiansson
asked
the
captain
well
yes
captain
yes
i
was
at
home
then
said
christian
christiansson
with
a
momentary
faltering
in
his
voice
in
that
case
you
must
have
seen
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
old
governor
tried
to
resist
the
change
and
lived
with
a
sword
over
his
head
all
his
latter
days
poor
devil
a
wise
old
man
though
wasn
t
he
said
christian
christiansson
he
could
scarcely
trust
himself
to
speak
wise
said
the
merchant
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
no
man
is
wise
who
will
not
be
warned
and
he
had
warning
enough
but
it
was
his
sons
who
settled
him
christian
christiansson
looked
up
with
a
start
ah
yes
of
course
his
sons
he
had
two
sons
i
remember
what
became
of
them
one
of
them
is
living
at
thingvellir
still
living
still
is
he
if
you
call
it
living
up
to
his
ears
in
debt
in
debt
you
say
always
has
been
always
will
be
as
for
the
other
one
olaf
eric
what
was
his
name
now
was
it
oscar
said
christian
christiansson
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
oscar
it
was
what
a
memory
you
must
have
sir
oscar
stephenson
he
used
to
think
he
could
do
a
little
in
your
line
sir
but
he
was
here
and
there
and
he
never
did
anything
in
his
life
except
put
an
end
to
it
you
would
hear
what
happened
it
all
came
out
in
the
newspapers
died
abroad
didn
t
he
shot
himself
in
a
gambling
hell
sir
the
young
rascal
said
the
captain
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
laugh
took
it
out
of
him
though
the
last
time
he
crossed
from
iceland
i
made
him
sleep
in
the
hold
serve
him
right
the
scoundrel
said
the
merchant
a
scoundrel
was
he
he
used
to
beat
his
poor
young
wife
black
and
blue
sir
beat
his
wife
you
say
she
died
of
his
anyway
he
killed
his
father
too
the
night
he
went
away
he
broke
open
the
governor
s
safe
and
carried
off
everything
broke
open
the
governor
s
safe
that
s
so
the
old
man
died
a
pauper
died
a
pauper
left
nothing
behind
him
so
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
every
stick
in
the
house
had
to
be
sold
to
the
new
minister
but
is
this
true
true
enough
sir
everything
came
out
at
the
general
election
the
governor
and
the
old
factor
were
rival
candidates
and
they
told
us
the
family
secrets
and
is
this
all
they
say
at
home
of
oscar
stephenson
all
not
a
tenth
of
it
then
his
very
name
must
be
hated
in
iceland
hated
execrated
sir
not
that
anybody
cares
about
the
old
governor
he
is
dead
and
gone
with
the
rotten
system
he
tried
to
support
but
as
for
his
son
nobody
can
say
bad
enough
about
him
so
that
if
he
had
lived
and
come
back
alive
he
would
have
been
hounded
out
of
the
country
sir
just
so
just
so
said
christian
christiansson
and
rising
with
a
startling
gesture
he
stumbled
back
to
his
stateroom
the
merchant
looked
after
him
uneasily
who
the
deuce
can
he
be
i
wonder
i
wonder
said
the
captain
pulling
at
his
extinguished
pipe
it
was
impossible
the
odium
attaching
to
the
name
of
oscar
stephenson
made
it
impossible
that
christian
christiansson
could
ever
reveal
his
identity
he
had
thought
that
the
dust
of
death
might
cover
his
transgressions
but
rumor
and
report
had
kept
them
alive
and
magnified
them
even
the
effort
of
his
family
to
conceal
the
truth
about
his
offenses
had
given
birth
to
falsehood
and
fostered
slander
the
people
of
iceland
must
never
know
that
christian
christiansson
was
oscar
stephenson
if
they
suspected
he
must
use
means
to
deepen
his
disguise
if
they
questioned
he
must
deny
what
else
had
he
expected
in
thinking
he
could
ever
allow
himself
to
be
known
in
his
true
name
and
character
what
secret
craving
of
pride
and
vanity
had
he
been
cherishing
unawares
his
errand
to
iceland
was
one
of
penance
and
atonement
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
been
looking
to
it
as
the
top
and
of
his
career
the
flush
and
crown
of
his
success
as
the
hour
of
triumph
when
he
was
to
justify
the
friends
who
had
loved
him
and
to
put
to
rout
the
enemies
who
had
hated
him
and
to
come
off
with
flying
colors
at
the
last
if
so
he
was
rightly
punished
oscar
stephenson
was
dead
and
nothing
and
nobody
could
bring
him
to
life
again
christian
christiansson
became
more
reserved
as
the
vessel
approached
its
destination
every
mile
of
the
voyage
was
full
of
memories
and
the
sweetest
were
the
bitterest
the
happiest
were
the
hardest
to
bear
he
was
standing
in
the
bow
when
he
caught
his
first
glimpse
of
iceland
glimmering
white
and
blue
like
a
sheeted
ghost
in
the
distance
where
its
glaciers
rose
out
of
the
sea
and
then
thinking
of
the
enchanted
hopes
of
the
days
when
he
had
first
seen
it
so
and
how
many
of
them
now
were
dead
under
ashes
he
would
have
broken
down
badly
but
for
the
captain
who
came
up
behind
him
and
said
in
his
cheery
croak
there
it
is
sir
there
s
your
country
that
s
the
place
you
ve
made
them
all
hear
about
christian
christiansson
returned
to
his
cabin
immediately
and
he
was
not
seen
on
deck
again
until
the
following
morning
when
the
laura
was
steaming
up
the
fiord
and
then
the
merchant
in
his
hat
and
overcoat
began
to
point
out
the
sights
to
him
as
to
a
stranger
there
s
the
old
town
sir
bigger
i
ll
be
bound
than
when
you
saw
it
last
that
s
the
new
shipyard
on
the
right
and
that
s
the
leper
hospital
on
the
left
this
is
engey
the
island
with
the
eider
duck
famous
place
for
young
folks
courting
sir
that
s
the
old
cathedral
in
the
middle
and
that
s
government
house
to
the
left
of
it
they
re
nearly
hidden
by
the
new
warehouses
now
i
built
them
myself
sir
the
laura
cast
anchor
under
the
town
amid
a
fleet
of
smacks
and
and
remembering
how
he
had
stood
there
last
christian
christiansson
s
emotion
would
have
mastered
him
again
but
for
the
bustle
that
was
going
on
around
the
orders
of
the
captain
from
the
bridge
the
shouts
of
the
sailors
who
were
lowering
the
ladder
and
the
cries
of
the
men
who
had
come
out
in
small
boats
and
were
clambering
up
to
the
deck
christian
christiansson
knew
most
of
the
boatmen
though
some
were
old
who
had
been
and
some
were
who
had
been
young
and
some
were
bearded
who
had
been
boys
but
none
of
them
recognized
christian
christiansson
as
they
tipped
their
hats
to
him
and
pushed
past
to
the
officers
of
the
ship
good
morning
mate
good
morning
captain
what
passengers
this
time
only
one
besides
jon
oddsson
but
he
s
a
host
in
himself
christian
christiansson
what
the
great
christian
christiansson
in
less
than
three
minutes
half
the
small
boats
were
scurrying
away
to
carry
the
news
to
the
town
while
the
owners
of
the
other
half
were
scrambling
for
christiansson
s
luggage
to
have
the
honor
of
taking
it
ashore
easy
on
my
lads
shouted
the
captain
christiansson
will
go
with
me
in
the
ship
s
boat
and
don
t
you
forget
it
it
was
a
full
before
this
could
come
to
pass
for
christian
christiansson
had
first
to
drink
the
captain
s
health
and
the
ship
s
luck
in
the
when
at
length
they
were
going
ashore
with
portmanteaus
piled
up
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
the
captain
chattering
in
the
stern
it
was
almost
more
than
christian
christiansson
could
do
to
control
himself
under
the
memory
of
the
dark
night
on
which
he
went
the
other
way
with
no
one
to
see
him
off
except
his
mother
who
sat
by
his
side
and
held
his
hand
as
if
she
could
never
part
with
it
when
the
boat
drew
up
alongside
the
jetty
was
packed
with
people
and
as
christian
christiansson
stepped
ashore
with
the
air
of
a
man
trying
to
escape
from
observation
but
conscious
of
being
under
the
full
fire
of
it
a
little
fat
fussy
person
with
asthmatical
breathing
christiansson
knew
him
instantly
bowed
deeply
and
began
to
read
something
from
a
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
it
was
an
effusive
address
drawn
up
hastily
by
the
chairman
of
the
town
board
in
the
name
of
the
inhabitants
beginning
illustrious
and
going
on
to
hail
christiansson
as
one
who
had
revived
the
ancient
spirit
and
glory
of
a
thousand
years
ago
agitated
and
ashamed
hardly
daring
to
speak
lest
the
sound
of
his
voice
should
betray
him
christian
christiansson
replied
with
a
few
commonplaces
and
then
amid
a
whispered
chorus
of
modest
the
modesty
of
greatness
sir
he
tried
to
push
his
way
toward
the
hotel
he
had
not
made
many
paces
before
he
was
confronted
by
a
young
man
in
the
uniform
hat
and
cloak
of
a
government
secretary
who
parted
the
crowd
and
said
in
the
breathless
gasps
of
one
who
had
been
running
the
minister
s
compliments
sir
and
will
you
do
him
the
honor
to
become
his
guest
at
government
house
christian
christiansson
tried
to
excuse
himself
but
every
eye
was
on
him
and
seeing
that
he
could
not
escape
without
the
danger
of
exposing
himself
to
suspicion
he
yielded
and
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
the
little
journey
to
government
house
was
like
the
progress
to
a
calvary
every
step
was
sown
with
memories
memories
of
the
pleasures
the
passions
the
darling
joys
the
sorrows
and
the
tragedies
of
the
past
but
while
they
seemed
to
strike
up
at
him
out
of
the
very
stones
of
the
street
he
had
to
nod
and
smile
as
the
secretary
walking
by
his
side
rattled
along
with
explanations
and
descriptions
of
the
places
they
passed
on
their
way
this
is
our
principal
thoroughfare
christiansson
that
is
our
chief
hotel
and
this
is
our
national
bank
the
large
building
flying
the
iceland
falcon
is
our
parliament
hall
that
is
our
old
cathedral
sir
and
this
this
is
government
house
suffocated
with
shame
choking
with
a
sense
of
duplicity
and
trembling
with
the
fear
of
detection
christian
christiansson
continued
to
say
yes
and
is
that
so
until
he
reached
the
porch
of
his
old
home
and
then
remembering
how
and
when
he
had
passed
out
of
it
last
alone
at
night
disgraced
and
with
his
father
s
door
closed
against
him
it
was
almost
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
restrain
an
impulse
to
turn
about
and
fly
but
just
at
that
moment
his
father
s
door
opened
quickly
and
there
on
the
threshold
another
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
governor
stood
waiting
with
outstretched
hand
to
welcome
him
the
palpitation
of
christian
christiansson
s
heart
was
almost
choking
him
what
wild
harlequinade
of
real
life
was
this
that
he
who
had
been
so
nearly
flung
out
of
iceland
should
be
received
back
to
it
with
open
arms
what
mad
game
of
s
buff
were
the
powers
of
destiny
playing
with
him
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
had
taken
the
name
of
christian
christiansson
what
invisible
wings
of
fate
had
been
over
him
when
he
did
so
and
were
they
plumed
to
honor
or
to
dishonor
to
reward
or
to
punishment
to
joy
or
to
sorrow
to
life
or
to
death
the
sheriff
made
minister
was
the
same
man
still
he
received
christian
christiansson
with
suavest
politeness
but
without
a
trace
of
recognition
welcome
he
said
welcome
to
iceland
my
wife
is
in
the
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
we
may
go
this
way
this
way
through
my
bureau
do
me
the
honor
to
follow
me
don
t
knock
against
the
stove
strangers
do
sometimes
a
ramshackle
old
house
sir
for
which
my
predecessor
was
responsible
i
m
building
a
better
in
another
part
of
the
town
you
ve
not
yet
dined
how
fortunate
in
these
high
latitudes
we
keep
up
primitive
customs
christiansson
we
dine
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
you
are
just
in
the
nick
of
time
i
was
holding
a
meeting
of
my
executive
when
the
news
of
your
arrival
reached
me
and
i
took
the
liberty
to
invite
one
or
two
of
my
colleagues
this
is
the
have
the
goodness
to
step
inside
muttering
monosyllables
only
in
reply
to
the
minister
s
explanations
christian
christiansson
followed
him
through
the
house
that
was
as
familiar
as
the
palm
of
his
hand
until
he
came
face
to
face
with
his
hostess
and
the
friends
who
had
been
invited
to
meet
him
the
hostess
was
an
acquaintance
of
his
grown
and
matronly
and
the
friends
were
the
rector
of
the
latin
school
looking
elderly
and
and
the
bishop
looking
white
and
old
they
received
him
with
the
utmost
cordiality
but
like
the
minister
without
a
sign
of
recognition
christian
christiansson
bowed
but
scarcely
spoke
he
was
no
longer
in
fear
of
discovery
for
now
he
knew
that
unless
he
wished
it
otherwise
he
could
pass
through
iceland
unknown
but
standing
there
in
the
old
home
with
the
traces
of
his
boyhood
about
him
his
heart
swelled
and
his
throat
thickened
and
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
control
himself
after
a
moment
a
servant
announced
dinner
and
the
minister
led
the
way
to
the
it
was
the
same
old
room
with
the
same
furniture
and
hardly
altered
in
any
particular
but
it
was
full
of
ghosts
in
the
eyes
of
him
who
entered
it
again
in
one
rapid
glance
christian
christiansson
took
in
everything
the
chair
his
father
used
to
sit
in
his
mother
s
place
magnus
s
and
thora
s
and
remembering
that
all
these
were
gone
that
everything
connected
with
his
own
people
had
faded
away
that
the
old
house
was
inhabited
by
others
now
and
nothing
remained
except
himself
and
he
had
neither
part
nor
lot
in
it
the
palpitation
of
his
heart
nearly
choked
him
again
and
he
sat
at
the
table
like
a
guilty
thing
but
if
christian
christiansson
was
silent
the
minister
talked
incessantly
you
will
find
that
iceland
knows
all
about
you
christiansson
all
about
you
speaking
for
myself
i
may
say
that
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
channels
of
intelligence
i
have
some
private
sources
of
information
my
son
you
know
my
son
i
think
christian
christiansson
bowed
my
son
has
kept
me
constantly
informed
so
you
will
find
me
abreast
of
all
your
movements
certainly
i
take
it
amiss
that
he
did
not
warn
me
of
your
coming
but
perhaps
he
didn
t
know
he
didn
t
i
thought
as
much
not
that
he
would
have
told
me
if
you
had
wished
it
concealed
neils
is
discretion
itself
sir
discretion
itself
for
instance
i
could
never
persuade
him
to
tell
me
who
you
were
i
tempted
him
i
confess
i
tempted
him
but
no
business
is
business
father
he
would
say
and
i
was
forced
to
be
content
iceland
is
honored
that
you
show
yourself
first
in
your
own
country
sir
said
the
rector
indeed
it
is
rector
and
christiansson
will
find
that
his
fame
is
no
empty
bubble
here
there
isn
t
a
student
who
doesn
t
sing
your
songs
sir
said
the
rector
nor
a
girl
of
fourteen
in
a
farmhouse
who
doesn
t
play
your
music
said
the
minister
s
wife
wonderful
said
the
minister
himself
it
s
perfectly
wonderful
but
i
always
say
the
musician
is
the
international
artist
other
artists
the
poets
for
example
require
their
translators
but
the
musician
needs
no
he
uses
the
one
universal
language
and
when
he
speaks
the
whole
world
may
hear
what
a
gift
what
a
thing
it
must
be
to
be
among
the
great
composers
perhaps
it
has
its
penalties
though
what
does
the
poet
say
they
learn
in
suffering
what
they
teach
in
song
what
a
thought
that
is
i
wonder
if
it
s
true
i
wonder
if
every
great
song
every
great
symphony
every
great
opera
is
born
of
the
suffering
the
actual
real
life
suffering
and
perhaps
in
some
cases
the
sin
and
sorrow
of
the
man
who
created
it
what
should
you
say
mr
christiansson
god
knows
said
christiansson
and
after
that
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
poor
stephen
said
the
bishop
suddenly
and
then
everybody
raised
his
face
from
the
table
i
was
thinking
said
the
bishop
that
if
sin
and
sorrow
added
to
the
gift
of
genius
go
to
the
making
of
great
music
somebody
was
born
in
this
very
house
who
should
have
left
immortal
works
behind
him
christian
christiansson
had
looked
up
with
the
rest
and
now
the
minister
leaned
across
to
him
and
said
in
an
undertone
a
sad
story
sir
a
son
of
my
predecessor
who
made
shipwreck
of
his
life
poor
fellow
you
mean
oscar
stephenson
yes
indeed
but
can
it
be
possible
that
you
knew
him
we
talked
of
him
on
the
steamer
ah
of
course
certainly
and
then
he
was
a
kind
of
humble
confrère
of
yours
and
conducted
at
covent
garden
what
a
tragedy
what
a
scandal
when
the
dreadful
news
came
from
nice
everybody
here
felt
ashamed
such
a
iceland
name
and
the
son
of
a
former
governor
it
was
almost
as
if
iceland
had
been
dishonored
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
sir
so
different
so
entirely
different
from
the
effects
the
glorious
effects
of
your
own
magnificent
achievements
christian
christiansson
was
quivering
from
heart
to
eyelids
but
the
same
mysterious
impulse
that
compels
the
lamb
to
confront
the
dog
forced
him
to
go
on
his
mother
is
alive
isn
t
she
he
said
anna
yes
she
s
alive
that
s
nearly
all
you
can
say
about
her
christian
christiansson
s
voice
deepened
and
shook
is
she
sick
he
asked
sick
in
fortune
at
all
events
when
the
old
governor
died
she
went
to
live
with
her
other
son
at
thingvellir
and
he
is
in
trouble
again
poor
creature
in
debt
isn
t
he
yes
he
is
in
debt
to
the
bank
for
the
interest
and
principal
of
some
money
which
his
father
borrowed
on
mortgage
to
keep
his
brother
out
of
prison
and
what
is
the
bank
going
to
do
with
him
sell
him
up
immediately
christian
christiansson
sank
into
silent
reverie
again
and
when
the
conversation
at
the
table
had
taken
another
turn
he
said
unexpectedly
he
left
a
child
behind
him
didn
t
he
who
sir
oh
oscar
stephenson
he
did
a
girl
she
s
living
too
isn
t
she
she
is
sir
that
is
to
say
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
rector
oscar
s
little
daughter
is
still
alive
is
she
not
alive
and
well
and
hearty
said
the
rector
christian
christiansson
s
eyes
brightened
visibly
that
s
good
news
at
all
events
he
said
the
altered
tone
startled
everybody
and
nobody
spoke
for
a
little
while
then
the
minister
said
it
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
take
an
interest
in
the
family
of
your
poor
dead
confrère
and
if
i
d
had
the
least
idea
you
wished
to
hear
more
about
them
it
would
have
been
so
easy
i
might
have
invited
the
banker
i
ll
see
him
said
christian
christiansson
and
then
breaking
through
his
reserve
he
talked
for
the
next
on
other
subjects
he
talked
well
and
the
company
were
delighted
for
there
was
no
one
to
know
that
his
vivacity
was
nervousness
and
his
laughter
something
like
shame
when
the
dinner
was
at
an
end
the
bishop
who
had
fixed
his
eyes
constantly
on
christian
christiansson
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
it
has
been
a
great
happiness
to
have
seen
you
christiansson
he
said
and
i
trust
we
may
meet
again
i
know
nothing
of
music
sir
but
i
rejoice
to
see
that
the
noble
musician
is
only
another
name
for
the
noble
man
and
i
pray
god
to
bless
you
body
and
soul
christian
christiansson
could
not
trust
himself
to
reply
for
the
bishop
s
praise
added
a
new
bitterness
to
his
remorse
so
he
stooped
over
the
old
man
s
hand
and
kissed
it
the
bishop
was
pleased
and
touched
how
charming
he
is
how
perfectly
charming
he
said
as
he
put
on
his
overcoat
in
the
porch
he
reminds
me
of
some
one
i
ve
met
somewhere
me
too
said
the
rector
those
beautiful
manners
that
captivating
smile
and
that
voice
that
goes
through
and
through
you
does
he
resemble
or
is
it
only
because
we
have
been
talking
at
table
you
mean
poor
young
yes
ah
me
said
the
bishop
as
he
opened
the
door
what
brave
things
he
might
have
done
if
heaven
had
willed
it
he
might
have
been
another
christian
christiansson
by
this
time
said
the
rector
poor
stephen
said
the
bishop
poor
anna
said
the
rector
and
the
two
old
friends
went
heavily
down
the
path
meantime
the
man
they
were
talking
of
though
they
did
not
know
it
was
going
through
an
agony
of
the
duplicity
of
winning
his
way
to
the
love
and
esteem
of
his
people
under
the
cover
of
a
false
name
was
suffocating
him
it
was
necessary
it
was
inevitable
it
was
a
part
of
the
conduct
that
was
forced
upon
him
by
the
errand
that
had
brought
him
home
but
if
they
who
welcomed
him
in
the
ignorance
of
their
enthusiasm
could
know
who
he
was
how
their
hearts
would
turn
from
him
how
their
sympathy
would
change
to
loathing
and
their
admiration
to
contempt
the
evening
was
one
of
prolonged
suffering
to
christian
christiansson
for
everything
that
happened
in
that
house
every
trivial
object
that
met
his
eye
seemed
charged
with
the
power
to
torture
him
as
soon
as
he
could
he
excused
himself
and
asked
to
be
shown
to
his
room
they
showed
him
to
the
bedroom
that
had
been
occupied
by
thora
that
was
the
last
drop
in
his
cup
he
felt
like
a
man
who
had
stumbled
into
a
hidden
grave
and
he
wanted
to
say
give
me
any
room
in
the
house
except
this
but
he
dared
not
speak
lest
his
slightest
word
should
betray
him
when
the
door
was
closed
he
flung
himself
in
the
armchair
before
the
stove
and
then
one
after
one
as
by
flashes
of
lightning
he
saw
over
again
the
scenes
of
his
life
with
which
that
room
was
associated
he
thought
of
his
wedding
night
when
with
a
fluttering
heart
he
came
on
tiptoe
into
the
cosy
nest
of
his
bridal
chamber
and
heard
thora
s
tremulous
breathing
behind
the
curtains
of
the
bed
he
thought
of
the
joyous
morning
when
her
pale
face
shone
like
sunshine
and
the
air
of
the
room
was
full
of
auroral
radiance
because
a
child
was
born
to
them
he
thought
of
the
dark
day
when
he
found
her
lying
dead
and
of
the
heavy
hour
when
he
took
his
last
look
at
her
and
buried
his
compositions
in
her
coffin
oh
miserable
mummery
oh
broken
and
senseless
vow
yet
not
senseless
either
save
to
his
own
violated
intention
for
now
he
knew
why
he
had
taken
the
name
of
christian
christiansson
in
the
blind
spasm
of
his
accusing
conscience
he
had
thought
it
was
merely
in
order
to
deny
himself
the
fame
which
his
works
were
to
win
for
him
but
the
inscrutable
and
ironical
powers
of
destiny
had
sterner
purposes
than
that
it
was
in
order
that
being
dead
as
oscar
stephenson
he
should
yet
return
to
iceland
in
order
that
he
should
see
the
accumulated
consequences
of
his
conduct
in
order
that
he
should
follow
as
if
with
bare
feet
on
the
hot
ground
of
a
geyser
the
footsteps
and
the
funeral
of
his
youth
in
order
that
the
living
might
torture
him
with
gratitude
and
the
dead
with
memories
in
order
that
god
s
right
hand
of
justice
should
fall
on
him
as
it
had
never
fallen
before
and
everything
he
had
done
should
be
paid
for
this
was
why
he
had
taken
the
name
and
won
the
fame
of
christian
christiansson
and
the
martyrdom
of
his
new
life
was
beginning
as
soon
as
the
bank
opened
in
the
morning
christian
christiansson
called
on
the
manager
and
was
received
with
extravagant
politeness
i
must
take
the
liberty
to
introduce
myself
he
began
quite
unnecessary
said
the
banker
with
a
bow
all
the
world
i
say
all
the
world
sir
has
been
introduced
to
you
you
would
receive
a
letter
from
my
banker
in
london
we
did
it
came
with
the
mail
that
was
brought
by
the
i
think
it
asks
you
to
honor
my
signature
up
to
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
that
is
the
amount
sir
two
hundred
thousand
and
if
you
wish
to
draw
any
of
it
immediately
i
do
said
christian
christiansson
and
taking
a
large
from
his
he
drew
out
a
and
took
up
a
pen
palsson
he
said
the
banker
started
at
the
mention
of
his
name
then
bowed
and
smiled
i
was
much
touched
by
a
case
of
distress
which
the
minister
spoke
of
at
dinner
yesterday
and
i
could
wish
to
be
of
some
assistance
you
are
very
generous
christiansson
and
if
i
can
be
of
the
slightest
use
to
you
i
say
if
i
can
be
of
the
slightest
use
sir
pray
be
good
enough
to
command
me
it
was
the
case
of
the
family
of
the
late
governor
i
understand
that
they
are
in
debt
to
the
bank
and
that
the
bank
is
in
the
act
of
distraining
unhappily
true
sir
but
the
bank
has
been
very
indulgent
i
say
the
bank
has
been
very
indulgent
it
was
impossible
to
hold
back
longer
i
think
that
the
debt
is
for
interest
on
a
mortgage
on
the
at
thingvellir
and
that
the
money
was
borrowed
by
the
father
of
the
present
owner
that
is
so
sir
but
the
interest
is
long
in
arrears
and
the
mortgage
i
say
the
mortgage
itself
sir
is
the
reverse
of
a
good
security
palsson
said
christian
christiansson
if
i
were
to
pay
you
the
interest
out
of
my
own
pocket
would
that
stop
the
proceedings
the
banker
s
breath
seemed
to
be
arrested
you
are
very
good
sir
he
said
after
a
moment
but
the
interest
is
large
you
can
hardly
be
prepared
for
the
amount
of
it
what
is
the
amount
of
it
asked
christian
christiansson
eight
thousand
crowns
at
least
sir
i
say
at
least
eight
thousand
and
in
any
case
i
should
be
unable
to
receive
it
things
have
gone
too
far
the
deed
of
execution
has
been
served
the
advertisements
of
the
auction
have
been
published
and
the
whole
matter
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
when
is
the
auction
to
take
place
let
me
see
said
the
banker
consulting
a
newspaper
this
is
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
auction
is
advertised
for
sir
did
you
say
said
christian
christiansson
rising
suddenly
at
nine
in
the
morning
sir
christian
christiansson
resumed
his
seat
and
sat
for
some
moments
nibbling
the
top
of
the
pen
then
he
said
palsson
i
have
been
many
years
abroad
but
i
seem
to
remember
that
when
landed
property
has
to
be
sold
by
the
law
in
iceland
three
auctions
are
necessary
two
at
the
office
of
the
sheriff
and
the
third
on
the
estate
itself
that
is
so
sir
but
unfortunately
this
is
the
third
the
two
others
have
taken
place
already
so
the
must
go
to
the
hammer
in
any
case
it
must
go
to
the
hammer
in
any
case
you
think
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
am
sure
sir
i
say
i
am
sure
there
is
no
help
for
it
ah
well
if
it
must
be
it
must
be
said
christian
christiansson
and
then
as
by
an
dipping
the
pen
in
the
ink
the
interest
is
eight
thousand
crowns
you
say
at
least
eight
thousand
sir
with
legal
and
other
expenses
probably
ten
i
say
probably
ten
and
the
principal
is
the
principal
is
one
hundred
thousand
sir
poor
souls
poor
souls
said
christian
christiansson
he
began
to
write
his
cheque
but
the
banker
went
on
talking
i
am
sorry
for
the
mother
sir
i
say
i
am
sorry
for
the
mother
she
belongs
to
a
generation
which
is
rapidly
passing
away
but
there
are
still
many
in
the
town
who
remember
her
a
good
motherly
soul
sir
it
is
a
pity
misfortune
should
fall
so
fast
on
her
in
the
evening
of
her
days
blotting
paper
thank
you
i
am
sorry
for
the
son
too
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
son
an
ishmael
sir
always
was
and
always
will
be
but
he
seems
to
have
had
a
terrible
time
of
it
to
tell
the
truth
the
farm
was
frightfully
at
the
beginning
and
if
he
had
thrown
it
up
fifteen
years
ago
it
might
have
been
better
for
himself
and
the
bank
and
everybody
apparently
he
wished
to
hold
on
to
it
for
the
sake
of
the
family
and
to
give
the
poor
wretch
his
due
he
has
made
a
splendid
fight
for
it
i
say
he
has
made
a
splendid
fight
for
it
christian
christiansson
had
written
his
cheque
and
was
tearing
it
out
of
the
then
as
you
say
sir
the
mortgage
was
not
made
by
himself
and
everybody
knows
the
conditions
under
which
the
first
debt
was
contracted
ah
if
that
scapegrace
brother
could
only
be
here
when
a
man
does
wrong
he
seems
to
think
the
consequences
of
his
crime
will
end
with
his
own
action
but
they
are
like
snowballs
rolling
in
the
snow
i
say
they
are
like
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
sir
christian
christiansson
had
handed
his
cheque
to
the
banker
and
the
banker
fixing
his
was
reading
the
amount
of
it
do
you
really
mean
that
you
wish
to
draw
the
whole
sum
at
once
mr
christiansson
if
you
please
said
christian
christiansson
the
banker
began
to
laugh
certainly
we
have
no
highwaymen
in
iceland
sir
i
say
we
have
no
highwaymen
but
unless
the
money
is
wanted
for
immediate
purposes
it
is
wanted
for
immediate
purposes
mr
palsson
in
that
case
of
course
certainly
may
i
ask
you
to
wait
a
little
it
took
to
find
the
money
for
christian
christiansson
s
cheque
and
when
it
came
it
was
in
three
banknotes
of
fifty
thousand
each
signed
specially
by
the
minister
and
fifty
other
notes
of
a
thousand
christiansson
put
the
whole
of
them
in
his
and
they
filled
it
to
its
utmost
capacity
i
ve
given
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
mr
palsson
it
has
been
a
pleasure
sir
i
say
it
has
been
a
pleasure
i
only
regret
that
i
was
unable
to
help
you
in
that
other
matter
if
you
had
come
to
me
two
days
ago
i
should
have
sent
a
messenger
to
the
sheriff
and
perhaps
he
who
is
the
sheriff
in
that
case
mr
palsson
the
sheriff
of
ames
sir
he
lives
at
borg
how
far
is
that
from
thingvellir
only
some
thirty
to
forty
miles
sir
about
as
far
as
from
here
to
there
about
the
same
sir
but
in
this
country
of
no
roads
and
no
railways
that
is
sometimes
a
long
day
s
journey
just
so
good
day
and
thank
you
mr
palsson
good
day
to
you
christiansson
said
the
banker
and
looking
after
him
he
thought
what
does
he
want
with
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
at
once
i
wonder
and
why
i
say
why
did
he
wish
to
pay
the
interest
for
magnus
stephenson
thank
god
i
ve
come
in
time
thought
christian
christiansson
and
going
out
of
the
bank
he
told
himself
with
a
thrill
of
hope
and
joy
that
the
inscrutable
powers
of
destiny
which
seemed
to
have
made
him
the
plaything
of
chance
and
error
could
not
be
wholly
evil
if
they
had
brought
him
back
to
iceland
at
the
moment
of
his
people
s
greatest
peril
that
he
might
succor
and
save
them
at
their
utmost
need
the
morning
was
heavy
and
cheerless
dark
woolly
clouds
were
rolling
over
the
mountains
a
cold
wind
was
coming
up
from
the
east
and
the
voice
of
the
north
sea
was
loud
and
shrill
we
shall
have
snow
before
the
year
s
out
sir
said
one
of
a
group
of
fishermen
who
were
stamping
their
feet
and
beating
their
arms
at
the
bottom
of
the
bank
steps
no
time
to
lose
thought
christian
christiansson
i
must
send
for
horses
immediately
and
start
off
without
delay
but
before
going
to
thingvellir
there
was
something
to
do
in
reykjavik
and
that
was
the
most
important
thing
of
all
by
some
excuse
or
subterfuge
he
had
to
see
his
child
as
a
first
step
toward
claiming
and
recovering
her
she
had
been
ten
years
at
the
farm
but
he
thought
she
was
still
at
the
factor
s
and
he
bent
his
steps
in
that
direction
of
the
factor
himself
he
knew
no
more
than
he
had
been
able
to
glean
at
breakfast
without
betraying
a
particular
interest
that
he
was
still
alive
that
enough
had
been
saved
out
of
the
wreck
of
his
fortunes
to
enable
him
to
keep
his
house
and
that
he
lived
the
life
of
a
misanthrope
blaming
the
whole
world
for
his
misfortunes
and
all
the
trouble
of
his
days
christian
christiansson
might
have
walked
to
the
factor
s
blindfold
but
the
house
itself
when
he
came
in
front
of
it
seemed
strangely
unfamiliar
the
once
bright
little
villa
looked
like
a
witless
man
who
has
lost
his
place
in
the
world
and
all
hope
and
all
respect
for
himself
the
white
paint
of
the
walls
was
cracked
and
dirty
the
windows
were
smeared
with
the
salt
which
is
borne
on
the
breath
of
the
sea
the
garden
was
wild
and
the
cobbled
path
was
overgrown
with
grass
it
was
hardly
like
a
house
a
young
girl
might
live
in
but
after
he
had
rung
the
bell
he
listened
for
a
light
step
in
the
hall
the
door
was
opened
by
a
withered
old
woman
in
white
ringlets
with
her
gown
tucked
up
in
front
it
was
aunt
margret
but
the
little
old
maid
once
so
pert
and
dainty
had
the
neglected
and
frightened
look
of
a
cat
in
an
empty
house
left
behind
and
forgotten
her
face
was
the
first
he
had
yet
seen
of
the
faces
of
his
own
people
and
so
hard
did
he
find
it
to
play
his
part
that
he
had
mentioned
her
name
before
he
was
aware
of
it
and
she
had
started
perceptibly
as
if
at
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
is
your
brother
at
home
margret
neilsen
he
asked
he
is
always
at
home
she
answered
but
he
never
receives
anybody
now
who
shall
i
say
wishes
to
see
him
say
that
christian
christiansson
would
like
to
speak
to
him
aunt
margret
who
was
not
wearing
her
spectacles
seemed
to
listen
for
a
moment
as
to
a
voice
that
came
to
her
from
afar
and
then
she
asked
him
into
the
house
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
he
listened
in
his
turn
for
the
silvery
voice
he
wished
to
hear
but
he
heard
nothing
save
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
for
the
house
echoed
like
a
vault
the
sense
of
change
made
him
forget
for
a
moment
the
object
of
his
visit
and
when
he
stepped
into
the
and
found
the
familiar
room
so
different
from
what
he
remembered
it
so
bare
so
bleak
so
stamped
with
the
seal
of
poverty
with
its
scrap
of
worn
carpet
on
the
floor
and
its
two
broken
firebricks
in
the
cold
stove
he
felt
as
if
the
ironical
powers
that
controlled
his
fate
had
brought
him
there
not
to
see
his
child
but
only
to
torture
him
after
a
moment
the
factor
came
in
with
the
old
fire
in
his
eyes
and
the
old
spirit
in
his
step
but
wearing
a
threadbare
over
a
threadbare
suit
that
had
once
been
black
and
looking
like
a
grey
rock
in
a
green
place
when
the
sun
has
gone
from
it
leaving
it
grim
and
hoary
i
heard
of
your
arrival
christiansson
he
said
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
your
call
but
i
am
an
old
man
who
has
lived
past
his
day
and
i
can
t
think
why
you
wished
to
see
me
christian
christiansson
had
his
subterfuge
ready
coming
from
london
he
said
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
tell
you
something
of
your
daughter
helga
you
know
my
daughter
helga
i
used
to
know
her
but
our
ways
have
parted
and
we
have
met
only
once
in
ten
years
nevertheless
i
know
all
about
her
and
can
tell
you
what
has
happened
what
has
happened
sir
she
has
become
a
great
singer
a
singer
has
she
a
great
then
she
s
rich
i
suppose
in
the
way
of
being
so
perhaps
but
famous
at
all
events
and
a
favorite
all
over
europe
the
factor
was
silent
for
a
moment
leaning
on
his
stick
then
he
said
well
that
will
suit
her
mother
i
daresay
as
for
me
i
don
t
think
it
matters
it
s
ten
years
since
helga
neilsen
left
iceland
and
i
ve
never
seen
the
scribe
of
a
line
from
her
since
if
she
s
rich
i
m
poor
and
she
doesn
t
care
anything
about
it
what
i
call
a
daughter
is
one
who
remembers
her
father
when
he
is
old
and
past
work
and
the
world
has
got
its
heel
on
him
i
had
a
daughter
like
that
once
but
they
killed
her
between
them
they
killed
her
between
them
i
say
the
old
man
s
voice
was
breaking
and
thinking
to
comfort
him
christian
christiansson
said
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
i
heard
of
your
trouble
mr
neilsen
when
did
you
hear
of
it
helga
couldn
t
have
told
you
she
had
too
much
to
do
with
her
sister
s
death
to
talk
of
it
did
you
perhaps
in
those
days
you
speak
of
did
you
know
my
daughter
s
husband
yes
said
christian
christiansson
for
in
that
moment
there
seemed
to
be
no
escape
from
it
then
you
knew
a
scoundrel
sir
said
the
factor
christian
christiansson
dared
not
flinch
though
the
factor
s
lash
had
cut
him
to
the
bone
with
a
throttled
utterance
he
tried
to
plead
for
charity
oscar
stephenson
never
ceased
to
reproach
himself
for
his
share
in
thora
s
death
or
to
mourn
it
s
a
pretty
way
to
mourn
for
one
daughter
to
corrupt
another
said
the
factor
corrupt
what
else
was
it
he
hadn
t
been
a
year
in
london
before
he
persuaded
helga
to
follow
him
neilsen
i
have
no
right
to
speak
for
the
man
we
are
talking
of
but
helga
is
your
daughter
and
if
it
is
any
comfort
to
you
i
tell
you
that
you
are
wrong
i
know
you
are
wrong
do
you
know
he
lived
in
the
same
house
didn
t
he
nevertheless
i
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
whatever
his
failures
of
duty
to
your
daughter
thora
while
she
was
alive
when
she
was
dead
he
reverenced
her
memory
too
much
to
was
it
reverencing
her
memory
to
sell
the
right
to
violate
her
grave
and
then
waste
the
money
at
the
the
perspiration
was
breaking
out
on
christian
christiansson
s
forehead
and
he
had
forgotten
the
object
of
his
errand
when
the
door
opened
and
he
looked
up
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
elin
it
was
only
aunt
margret
again
but
now
washed
and
oiled
and
wearing
her
spectacles
christian
christiansson
placed
a
chair
for
the
childless
woman
and
began
to
talk
about
the
child
the
man
we
are
speaking
of
had
his
faults
god
knows
but
if
you
had
heard
him
talk
about
you
sir
and
your
sister
and
his
daughter
especially
his
little
daughter
he
talked
about
his
daughter
did
he
constantly
he
seemed
to
be
always
thinking
of
her
he
never
did
anything
else
then
he
left
me
to
bring
her
up
and
never
sent
a
penny
toward
her
support
he
was
poor
himself
perhaps
indeed
i
know
he
was
poor
then
what
about
the
letters
he
wrote
to
his
mother
bragging
of
his
business
and
the
fine
friends
he
was
making
christian
christiansson
dropped
his
head
and
when
my
own
business
was
broken
up
did
he
offer
to
relieve
me
of
my
burden
that
was
afterward
oscar
you
are
confusing
the
dates
said
aunt
margret
hold
your
tongue
margret
neilsen
i
know
what
i
m
saying
no
sir
when
the
ingrate
at
government
house
made
me
a
bankrupt
and
i
didn
t
know
if
i
should
have
a
roof
to
cover
me
it
was
the
father
s
brother
who
had
to
take
the
child
off
my
hands
magnus
magnus
stephenson
and
he
had
his
mother
to
provide
for
already
then
elin
is
at
thingvellir
and
magnus
has
been
bringing
her
up
all
these
years
how
good
of
him
and
now
he
is
a
broken
man
himself
poor
fellow
serve
him
right
if
he
is
said
the
factor
i
ve
no
pity
for
him
either
he
was
the
beginning
of
all
the
trouble
but
when
a
brave
man
who
has
borne
other
people
s
burdens
a
brave
fool
you
mean
sir
fortune
comes
to
every
man
once
sir
and
it
came
to
him
but
he
wouldn
t
have
it
look
at
this
room
sir
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
used
to
have
four
assistants
eating
and
drinking
with
me
here
and
magnus
stephenson
was
one
of
them
he
had
good
ideas
in
those
days
and
if
he
had
stayed
with
me
we
should
have
kept
out
the
free
traders
and
he
would
have
been
the
first
man
in
the
west
of
iceland
by
this
time
i
gave
him
every
chance
too
i
was
willing
to
make
him
my
partner
and
marry
him
to
my
daughter
thora
but
no
grasp
all
lose
all
he
insulted
my
girl
and
turned
up
his
nose
at
my
contract
and
now
he
s
down
but
he
s
not
done
yet
what
gets
wet
on
a
fool
gets
dry
on
a
knave
and
magnus
stephenson
will
be
worse
than
a
bankrupt
before
we
ve
heard
the
end
of
him
neilsen
said
christian
christiansson
who
was
breathing
heavily
you
are
wrong
again
and
you
ought
to
know
it
who
says
i
am
wrong
sir
and
what
am
i
wrong
in
you
are
wrong
in
thinking
that
when
magnus
stephenson
refused
to
marry
your
daughter
thora
he
did
so
from
selfishness
if
it
wasn
t
selfishness
sir
what
was
it
it
was
unselfishness
sublime
unselfishness
so
thora
had
found
that
she
loved
his
brother
oscar
and
to
make
her
happy
magnus
was
willing
to
give
her
up
to
him
but
the
contract
was
made
and
you
had
built
all
your
hopes
on
it
so
to
save
your
daughter
from
your
displeasure
he
allowed
it
to
appear
that
he
refused
her
although
he
loved
her
dearly
and
his
heart
was
breaking
the
factor
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
wild
lustre
in
his
eyes
but
is
this
true
he
said
it
is
god
s
truth
sir
who
did
you
have
it
from
from
one
who
should
have
told
you
himself
fifteen
years
ago
but
dared
not
the
factor
turned
rigidly
to
his
sister
margret
neilsen
do
you
hear
what
he
is
saying
aunt
margret
who
was
breathing
audibly
merely
bowed
her
head
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
to
you
sir
if
what
you
tell
me
is
true
i
ve
been
hating
the
wrong
man
for
half
a
and
yet
people
talk
of
providence
god
veils
his
face
from
us
factor
we
are
only
his
little
children
he
has
his
own
plans
and
purposes
good
lord
sir
said
the
factor
in
a
husky
croak
what
purpose
can
there
be
in
blinding
a
man
for
fifteen
years
and
letting
him
break
up
all
his
friendships
he
was
walking
to
and
fro
to
calm
his
nerves
under
the
shock
as
of
a
moral
earthquake
if
i
have
been
wrong
about
magnus
i
may
have
been
wrong
about
oscar
also
i
got
frightened
when
he
signed
my
name
so
i
helped
to
send
him
out
of
iceland
and
now
he
is
dead
christian
christiansson
s
head
was
down
his
throat
was
surging
his
father
is
dead
too
we
quarrelled
about
our
children
and
now
it
seems
it
all
began
with
a
blunder
he
was
my
friend
for
fifty
years
and
i
ve
never
had
another
there
s
no
such
thing
as
making
an
old
friend
in
your
old
age
sir
and
when
your
friends
are
gone
the
world
gets
lonely
perhaps
i
was
hard
on
oscar
too
he
was
my
godson
i
liked
the
boy
in
spite
of
everything
and
he
always
came
to
see
the
old
man
the
minute
he
set
foot
in
iceland
christian
christiansson
wanted
to
throw
off
all
disguise
and
cry
and
i
m
here
again
godfather
but
he
could
not
and
dared
not
speak
he
rose
to
go
and
the
factor
took
him
to
the
door
i
ll
come
again
before
i
leave
the
country
he
said
at
the
last
moment
and
then
perhaps
i
ll
have
something
to
say
to
you
when
the
factor
returned
to
the
looking
like
the
same
grey
rock
but
with
clouds
enveloping
it
aunt
margret
who
had
scarcely
moved
said
in
the
frightened
voice
of
one
who
has
seen
a
ghost
do
you
know
who
that
was
what
do
you
mean
that
was
oscar
stephenson
margret
neilson
you
are
mad
oscar
stephenson
is
dead
then
he
came
to
life
again
that
is
oscar
stephenson
as
sure
as
i
m
a
living
woman
christian
christiansson
left
the
factor
s
house
glowing
with
excitement
oh
for
the
hour
when
he
could
lay
aside
the
armor
of
duplicity
when
he
could
say
to
his
own
people
i
am
oscar
stephenson
let
the
world
think
me
christian
christiansson
but
at
least
you
must
know
me
for
who
i
am
it
was
necessary
and
inevitable
that
he
should
reveal
himself
to
his
own
family
how
else
could
he
carry
out
the
plan
he
had
formed
of
buying
the
farm
at
the
auction
morning
and
giving
it
back
to
his
brother
and
how
except
by
right
of
blood
by
right
of
parentage
could
he
claim
the
child
and
take
her
away
with
him
when
he
returned
to
england
in
this
mood
he
went
back
to
government
house
and
announced
his
intention
of
going
on
to
thingvellir
thingvellir
said
the
minister
it
s
only
natural
sir
that
you
should
wish
to
see
our
great
historic
the
scene
of
so
many
of
our
sagas
but
why
go
there
it
isn
t
every
day
the
old
town
is
alive
but
this
is
the
last
of
the
year
you
know
and
before
midnight
we
shall
have
many
interesting
ceremonies
why
not
stay
until
and
then
i
shall
be
happy
to
go
with
you
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
go
said
christian
christiansson
that
s
a
pity
and
our
townspeople
will
be
wofully
disappointed
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
ve
done
nothing
all
morning
but
receive
deputations
asking
me
to
offer
you
a
public
banquet
every
class
of
the
community
is
excited
and
the
students
are
talking
of
a
torchlight
procession
that
settles
it
finsen
i
must
go
now
in
any
case
you
are
too
modest
christiansson
but
perhaps
you
don
t
know
the
way
and
then
look
at
the
clouds
a
snowstorm
is
coming
i
know
every
inch
of
the
way
and
the
snowstorm
if
it
is
not
too
heavy
will
only
add
to
my
pleasure
if
it
is
not
too
heavy
believe
me
there
s
nothing
in
the
world
more
miserable
than
being
caught
in
a
blinding
snowstorm
on
the
moss
fell
heath
but
if
you

the
with
the
ponies
came
round
at
noon
and
by
that
time
the
report
of
christiansson
s
departure
having
passed
through
the
town
a
number
of
the
townspeople
had
gathered
at
the
gate
to
see
him
off
among
them
were
palsson
the
banker
oddsson
the
merchant
zimsen
the
captain
jonsson
the
chairman
of
the
town
board
and
most
surprising
of
all
the
factor
there
was
a
tingling
atmosphere
of
unsatisfied
curiosity
in
the
little
crowd
for
rumor
of
the
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
had
passed
from
lip
to
lip
and
people
were
asking
who
the
stranger
was
who
his
father
had
been
and
what
he
could
want
with
so
much
money
when
christian
christiansson
in
his
long
blue
ulster
and
fur
cap
came
out
of
the
house
and
parted
from
his
host
and
hostess
at
the
porch
he
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
for
he
saluted
everybody
at
the
gate
and
mentioned
most
of
the
company
by
name
this
intensified
the
curiosity
and
amid
a
running
fire
of
chaff
and
laughter
the
bolder
ones
began
to
probe
with
questions
you
ll
put
up
at
the
mr
christiansson
no
doubt
jonsson
no
doubt
but
there
s
to
be
an
auction
there
in
the
morning
you
know
i
say
there
s
to
be
an
auction
in
the
morning
so
you
ll
be
turned
out
unless
said
the
captain
with
a
wink
in
his
weather
eye
unless
christiansson
buys
up
the
old
place
and
turns
farmer
and
innkeeper
and
why
not
captain
zimsen
why
not
hard
work
early
and
late
sir
well
no
man
ever
won
the
day
by
snoring
christian
christiansson
had
swung
to
the
saddle
when
the
factor
came
up
to
him
with
his
rheumy
eyes
shining
and
said
don
t
be
surprised
if
i
follow
you
to
thingvellir
life
is
short
and
before
i
die
i
have
something
to
say
to
magnus
stephenson
we
talked
of
him
on
the
ship
sir
didn
t
we
him
and
his
rascally
young
brother
said
the
merchant
we
did
said
christian
christiansson
and
then
at
the
last
moment
the
being
mounted
and
everything
ready
a
spirit
of
recklessness
came
over
him
and
he
added
but
you
made
one
mistake
mr
oddsson
and
what
was
that
mr
christiansson
you
said
oscar
stephenson
had
never
done
anything
in
his
life
except
putting
an
end
to
it
but
he
did
one
thing
once
i
remember
he
stood
for
parliament
when
i
was
at
home
and
gave
a
dreadful
drubbing
to
the
dunderhead
who
opposed
him
when
he
was
gone
it
was
the
same
is
if
a
spell
had
been
broken
something
in
his
last
word
something
in
his
laugh
and
something
in
the
lifting
of
his
cap
as
he
cantered
up
the
road
had
struck
a
vague
consciousness
of
his
identity
into
the
gossips
at
the
gate
for
a
moment
they
stared
into
each
other
s
face
in
blank
bewilderment
and
then
the
merchant
said
who
the
deuce
can
he
be
then
shall
i
tell
you
who
my
sister
says
he
is
said
the
factor
who
oscar
stephenson
himself
it
fell
in
their
midst
like
a
thunderbolt
well
that
would
explain
something
i
say
that
would
explain
something
said
the
banker
and
he
told
the
story
of
magnus
stephenson
s
interest
within
the
word
had
gone
through
the
town
with
the
rush
and
rattle
of
the
holme
wind
christian
christiansson
was
oscar
stephenson
almost
in
as
many
words
he
had
said
so
himself
and
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
about
it
that
night
at
the
artisans
institute
there
were
a
hundred
stories
of
oscar
stephenson
some
of
them
were
good
and
they
were
told
with
tears
but
some
were
bad
yet
they
were
received
with
peals
of
laughter
in
the
of
the
hotel
the
students
sang
oscar
s
songs
until
the
lamps
went
out
and
then
they
bellowed
them
through
the
darkness
in
a
dozen
different
keys
while
the
windows
rattled
with
the
vibration
of
their
lusty
voices
meantime
a
group
of
sedater
citizens
had
taken
their
surmise
to
the
minister
and
he
had
said
with
his
shy
smile
we
can
not
uncover
his
nakedness
you
know
but
we
can
go
on
with
the
arrangements
for
the
banquet
and
so
tempt
him
to
reveal
himself
they
went
on
with
them
immediately
the
banquet
was
to
be
at
the
templars
hall
the
night
after
the
stranger
s
return
to
reykjavik
the
minister
was
to
propose
christian
christiansson
iceland
s
favorite
son
and
heir
then
the
students
were
to
sing
oscar
stephenson
s
patriotic
hymn
isafold
my
isafold
great
land
of
frost
and
fire
and
after
the
guest
had
spoken
the
cathedral
choir
were
to
give
christian
christiansson
s
stirring
anthem
who
shall
ascend
into
the
hill
of
the
lord
who
shall
rise
up
in
his
holy
place
even
he
who
has
clean
hands
and
a
pure
heart
and
hath
not
lifted
up
his
mind
with
vanity
everything
else
was
forgotten
the
odium
attaching
for
ten
years
to
oscar
stephenson
s
name
was
gone
the
dishonor
which
death
itself
could
not
kill
had
disappeared
before
the
blinding
light
of
genius
the
glittering
shrine
of
success
meantime
the
man
himself
was
on
his
way
to
thingvellir
the
clouds
might
be
low
but
his
heart
was
high
the
sea
might
break
on
the
black
beach
with
a
monotonous
moan
but
his
whole
being
sang
a
song
of
hope
a
wild
activity
of
thoughts
imagination
feelings
and
impulses
possessed
him
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
returned
to
iceland
he
was
entirely
happy
god
had
permitted
him
to
come
in
time
to
save
his
people
from
being
made
houseless
and
homeless
he
had
sinned
and
he
had
suffered
but
the
sacred
duty
of
atonement
was
not
to
be
denied
him
the
which
had
been
mortgaged
to
save
him
from
the
grip
of
the
law
was
to
be
given
back
unburdened
to
his
brother
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
were
in
his
breast
pocket
and
they
were
to
buy
the
old
place
at
the
auction
morning
as
he
cantered
up
the
road
that
led
out
of
the
town
his
soul
careered
like
a
leaf
in
autumn
under
a
bottom
wind
of
hope
and
joy
he
saw
himself
arriving
at
the
farm
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
meeting
his
mother
and
magnus
and
his
daughter
elin
he
heard
himself
saying
mother
don
t
you
know
me
i
am
oscar
and
i
have
come
back
to
make
amends
and
next
day
when
the
auction
would
be
over
the
sheriff
gone
and
everybody
crying
for
happiness
he
saw
himself
taking
elin
between
his
knees
elin
with
the
eyes
of
thora
yet
with
his
own
face
looking
at
him
as
in
a
glass
and
saying
you
are
to
come
with
me
now
my
dearest
and
if
you
have
gone
short
of
anything
as
a
child
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
as
a
woman
the
caught
the
contagion
of
his
high
spirits
and
as
they
cantered
along
he
sang
snatches
of
the
dance
by
night
and
dance
by
day
life
and
time
will
pass
away
love
alone
will
last
alway
he
was
a
tall
lad
of
eighteen
who
must
have
resembled
his
mother
for
he
had
the
pink
and
white
face
of
a
girl
they
had
passed
the
hot
springs
and
the
ellida
river
and
risen
to
the
heights
of
the
first
hill
on
their
journey
before
the
sunshine
of
the
boy
s
spirits
began
to
be
overcast
then
as
they
rested
their
ponies
and
tightened
the
girths
he
said
in
a
frightened
whisper
do
you
hear
it
sir
hear
what
said
christian
christiansson
the
peak
said
the
boy
pointing
to
a
rock
of
rugged
outline
that
stood
on
the
topmost
line
of
the
mountain
to
their
right
with
a
dark
cloud
that
was
like
a
great
monster
of
the
air
poised
above
it
what
about
it
my
boy
the
storm
and
the
peak
are
friends
sir
for
they
always
talk
together
before
the
wind
comes
down
when
people
hear
them
talking
they
tremble
because
they
know
the
storm
is
coming
let
us
get
on
then
said
christian
christiansson
in
they
had
come
to
the
bleak
and
barren
country
of
the
red
hill
the
red
lake
and
the
deep
tarn
with
its
dark
waters
and
gloomy
shore
and
by
that
time
the
great
cloud
which
had
been
poised
above
the
peak
was
broken
into
many
parts
and
each
part
seemed
to
be
fighting
the
others
in
the
sky
for
there
were
volleys
of
sound
like
thunder
hadn
t
we
better
stop
at
the
farm
at
middale
sir
said
the
boy
but
christian
christiansson
thought
of
his
mother
of
magnus
of
elin
and
of
the
auction
morning
and
he
determined
to
push
on
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
moss
fell
heath
when
the
snow
began
to
fall
it
fell
at
first
in
big
flakes
like
dead
butterflies
for
there
was
yet
no
wind
on
the
ground
although
the
clouds
were
still
scurrying
across
the
sky
and
the
noise
overhead
was
deafening
christian
christiansson
remembered
what
the
minister
had
said
that
of
all
the
miseries
of
life
the
worst
was
to
be
caught
in
a
snowstorm
on
this
desolate
moor
and
for
one
moment
he
asked
himself
if
he
ought
not
to
go
back
to
middale
and
wait
there
until
the
storm
had
passed
but
at
the
next
instant
he
told
himself
that
the
devilish
powers
which
had
dogged
his
steps
since
he
landed
in
iceland
were
trying
to
keep
him
back
from
the
good
work
he
meant
to
do
so
he
must
go
on
in
any
case
you
re
not
afraid
my
lad
not
to
say
afraid
faltered
the
boy
let
us
gallop
then
the
heath
itself
when
they
came
to
it
was
a
white
wilderness
within
the
embracement
of
black
rocks
and
mountains
they
were
only
able
to
find
the
road
by
following
the
beacons
which
were
like
sentinels
in
single
file
with
their
backs
to
the
storm
going
on
and
on
over
the
wide
waste
the
sense
of
desolation
was
appalling
and
a
voice
seemed
to
say
go
back
while
there
is
time
to
do
so
but
again
christian
christiansson
thought
of
his
mother
of
magnus
of
elin
and
of
the
auction
morning
and
he
urged
his
horse
through
the
deepening
snow
they
had
not
gone
much
farther
when
the
wind
came
down
and
hurled
itself
in
their
faces
the
snowflakes
were
pelted
and
slung
at
them
like
splinters
of
flint
it
seemed
as
if
every
flake
would
cut
through
their
skin
then
the
cold
became
intense
ice
gathered
over
their
eyes
and
at
every
other
minute
they
had
to
stop
to
break
it
away
finally
the
darkness
descended
upon
them
the
deadly
implacable
darkness
of
the
wind
and
snow
a
wild
torrent
of
whirling
snowflakes
swept
over
the
moor
and
concealed
them
from
each
other
it
became
so
dark
that
they
could
only
see
a
few
yards
on
either
side
and
they
had
to
cry
out
at
intervals
in
order
to
keep
together
they
were
now
in
the
mighty
grip
of
the
storm
and
could
no
longer
think
of
going
back
the
wind
hissed
and
howled
and
wept
the
snow
pelted
and
cut
there
was
no
shelter
of
rock
or
tree
or
bush
on
any
side
there
was
nothing
about
or
above
them
but
the
wide
wilderness
and
the
thickening
darkness
christian
christiansson
was
sorry
for
the
boy
but
thus
far
his
own
spirits
had
risen
with
every
fresh
phase
of
the
tempest
he
had
a
sense
of
fighting
a
fierce
duel
with
the
elements
at
the
other
end
of
his
journey
were
his
mother
and
magnus
and
elin
and
if
he
could
reach
them
before
morning
he
would
be
able
to
succor
and
save
them
it
was
a
race
as
for
life
for
the
lives
of
his
nearest
and
dearest
against
the
wild
wantonness
of
elemental
powers
nature
herself
with
more
than
her
usual
heartlessness
toward
man
was
at
devilish
war
with
his
effort
to
save
his
people
but
he
would
conquer
her
let
it
snow
or
blow
or
hail
or
thunder
he
would
reach
home
in
time
for
the
auction
the
ponies
were
the
first
to
fail
the
one
that
christian
christiansson
rode
was
a
strong
mare
of
mature
age
but
the
boy
s
was
a
young
one
newly
broken
and
it
seemed
to
be
suffocating
in
the
snow
and
the
wind
after
a
time
it
turned
its
head
from
the
storm
and
refused
to
go
forward
and
then
the
boy
had
to
alight
and
walk
in
front
of
it
and
tug
it
along
by
the
bridle
in
a
little
while
it
stopped
altogether
and
slid
down
on
its
side
and
could
with
difficulty
be
raised
to
its
feet
again
he
s
only
four
and
this
is
his
first
journey
said
the
boy
in
a
whimpering
tone
as
he
laid
the
lash
on
the
pony
s
back
then
the
boy
himself
began
to
give
in
he
wore
bag
gloves
with
two
thumbs
but
no
fingers
and
in
tugging
at
the
bridle
he
lost
one
of
them
as
a
consequence
his
bare
hand
got
and
was
soon
quite
powerless
in
walking
before
the
horse
his
clothes
had
frozen
stiff
and
he
was
hardly
able
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
his
voice
became
weaker
and
his
speech
more
broken
and
when
his
companion
called
back
to
him
he
could
scarcely
send
forward
his
reply
at
last
in
a
faint
voice
he
cried
come
and
fetch
me
sir
i
have
no
strength
left
a
little
later
he
became
delirious
talked
of
his
mother
and
tried
to
strip
off
his
clothes
as
if
he
were
going
to
bed
christian
christiansson
experienced
deep
anguish
of
mind
at
the
thought
of
the
sufferings
he
had
inflicted
upon
the
lad
but
he
lifted
him
to
the
saddle
with
his
back
to
the
horse
s
head
and
comforted
him
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
awful
situation
courage
my
boy
courage
the
house
of
rest
can
not
be
far
off
we
ll
shelter
there
the
storm
will
pass
a
vision
of
the
little
house
of
basaltic
rocks
which
he
had
entered
with
helga
had
been
floating
through
his
mind
like
a
dream
of
the
calenture
how
long
it
took
him
to
get
there
and
with
what
desperate
exertions
he
never
knew
but
walking
in
front
of
the
young
pony
and
leading
the
mare
beside
him
he
reached
the
little
house
at
last
as
soon
as
they
were
under
cover
the
boy
dropped
to
his
knees
and
with
a
gibbering
accent
as
if
speaking
through
lips
he
began
to
repeat
the
greed
i
believe
in
god
the
father
almighty
he
thought
he
was
saying
his
prayers
the
house
of
rest
was
badly
provided
but
it
had
hay
for
the
horses
and
they
began
to
munch
it
immediately
there
was
no
lamp
and
when
the
door
was
shut
to
keep
out
the
driving
snow
the
place
was
in
pitch
darkness
after
a
while
the
air
became
warm
with
the
breath
of
the
ponies
and
the
men
s
clothes
melted
this
made
them
very
cold
and
they
had
to
beat
their
arms
under
their
armpits
to
keep
their
bodies
from
shivering
and
their
teeth
from
chattering
then
the
atmosphere
grew
hot
for
the
ponies
began
to
sweat
and
the
boy
stripped
off
his
outer
garments
and
lay
down
with
the
young
horse
boy
and
horse
side
by
side
as
if
they
had
been
human
companions
christian
christiansson
threw
himself
upon
the
wooden
platform
prepared
for
travelers
and
listened
to
the
storm
outside
the
wind
was
howling
and
hissing
around
the
corners
of
the
house
and
he
had
the
sense
of
the
snow
becoming
deeper
and
deeper
about
it
if
the
storm
continued
the
little
place
might
be
buried
before
long
and
then
it
would
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
cut
a
way
out
his
heart
fell
low
he
began
to
feel
appalled
by
the
awfulness
of
his
position
the
devilish
elements
were
beating
him
he
was
only
half
way
on
his
journey
and
if
he
could
not
make
the
rest
of
it
before
morning
his
mother
and
magnus
and
little
elin
would
be
homeless
yet
the
storm
showed
no
sign
of
abating
the
ponies
were
spent
the
boy
was
done
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
go
on
suddenly
a
new
thought
came
to
him
and
he
raised
himself
and
cried
my
boy
my
boy
do
you
know
the
road
from
borg
to
thingvellir
yes
sir
said
the
boy
s
drowsy
voice
in
the
darkness
what
sort
of
road
is
it
awful
sir
worse
than
this
ten
times
worse
over
the
hengel
mountain
and
past
the
boiling
pits
sir
thank
god
said
christian
christiansson
and
he
lay
down
again
with
content
telling
himself
that
the
same
storm
that
was
keeping
him
back
must
keep
back
the
sheriff
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
auction
morning
the
storm
still
hissed
and
howled
and
wept
in
the
wild
wilderness
outside
but
the
tempest
had
now
lost
its
terrors
the
boy
and
the
young
pony
had
fallen
asleep
and
were
breathing
heavily
the
mare
was
munching
the
last
of
the
hay
and
christian
christiansson
with
his
heart
at
ease
and
a
sense
of
safety
had
settled
himself
for
the
night
and
was
dropping
off
into
unconsciousness
when
there
came
a
thud
on
the
roof
of
the
little
house
he
started
up
and
listened
and
again
he
heard
the
over
his
head
the
mare
also
heard
the
strange
sounds
and
ceasing
to
eat
she
came
across
to
him
as
if
in
fear
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
legs
it
was
not
at
first
that
he
realized
that
the
sounds
were
human
footsteps
and
that
somebody
was
walking
on
the
roof
but
as
soon
as
he
did
so
he
cried
out
to
know
who
was
there
and
a
voice
that
was
like
a
voice
out
of
a
grave
answered
let
me
in
he
removed
the
saddles
with
which
he
had
barricaded
the
door
and
opened
it
there
was
then
another
doorway
of
the
snow
that
had
fallen
since
he
entered
but
in
a
little
while
he
had
cut
it
away
with
the
spade
that
hung
on
the
wall
for
that
purpose
at
the
next
moment
a
man
crossed
the
threshold
a
man
and
a
horse
oh
god
what
a
night
said
the
stranger
he
seemed
to
be
scared
and
by
the
uproar
he
had
come
out
of
when
christian
christiansson
had
closed
and
barricaded
the
door
afresh
the
darkness
seemed
denser
than
ever
have
you
any
matches
he
asked
no
yes
that
is
to
say
i
m
afraid
they
re
damp
said
the
stranger
he
struck
one
and
it
spluttered
out
take
care
then
a
boy
is
lying
asleep
on
the
floor
bring
your
horse
this
way
thanks
how
lucky
i
heard
you
i
had
lost
the
road
and
was
wondering
what
hollow
ground
i
was
walking
on
when
you
shouted
from
below
it
nearly
frightened
my
life
out
it
was
a
young
voice
the
stranger
was
clearly
a
young
man
probably
a
young
farmer
they
talked
together
in
the
darkness
neither
being
able
to
see
the
other
s
face
who
are
you
my
lad
asked
christian
christiansson
i
am
eric
arnasson
i
come
from
thingvellir
who
are
you
sir
i
am
a
traveler
and
i
m
on
my
way
there
going
to
the
sale
i
suppose
yes
then
i
have
just
come
from
the
house
you
are
bound
for
are
you
a
at
the
used
to
be
but
the
hands
are
all
gone
now
i
was
the
last
to
leave
sir
where
are
gudrun
and
jon
vidalin
farming
korastead
these
ten
years
sir
and
asher
he
has
gone
too
we
thinned
down
fast
when
the
master
got
into
trouble
i
was
with
him
from
the
time
i
was
a
little
chap
but
he
paid
me
off
this
afternoon
where
s
old
maria
dead
long
ago
is
there
nobody
left
then
nobody
but
the
master
and
his
old
mother
and
his
young
daughter
daughter
well
everybody
calls
her
so
but
she
s
only
his
niece
is
there
nobody
else
in
the
house
not
a
soul
that
i
know
of
and
they
will
not
be
there
another
night
i
suppose
but
the
sale
can
not
take
place
my
lad
the
sheriff
will
never
be
able
to
get
there
he
has
to
come
from
borg
and
the
road
over
the
mountain
is
even
wilder
than
this
the
sheriff
is
there
now
sir
now
i
left
him
in
the
kitchen
when
i
came
away
making
a
list
of
the
house
property
and
he
was
to
sleep
at
the
parsonage
christian
christiansson
s
hair
seemed
to
rise
from
his
head
there
was
no
escape
from
the
terrible
journey
he
must
go
on
in
spite
of
the
storm
his
limbs
felt
like
lead
and
when
he
tried
to
move
them
he
could
only
do
so
with
a
tremendous
effort
but
he
shook
off
his
torpor
and
began
to
saddle
his
mare
what
do
you
think
is
the
time
my
lad
i
don
t
know
my
watch
has
stopped
and
then
i
have
no
light
either
it
must
be
seven
o
clock
at
least
but
you
re
not
thinking
of
going
on
sir
i
must
you
ll
never
get
to
thingvellir
sir
it
was
bad
enough
for
me
with
my
back
to
the
storm
but
it
will
be
ten
times
worse
for
you
with
your
face
to
it
you
ll
be
lost
your
friends
will
see
no
more
of
you
good
night
take
the
boy
back
to
reykjavik
in
the
morning
out
on
the
snowfield
again
christian
christiansson
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
headlong
impulse
to
go
on
the
saddle
was
damp
and
he
had
a
sensation
of
riding
in
cold
water
the
snow
was
deeper
than
before
and
sometimes
his
horse
stumbled
up
to
its
girths
the
darkness
was
now
the
darkness
of
night
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
could
follow
the
line
of
the
beacons
the
wind
hurled
itself
against
his
body
the
snow
slung
itself
against
his
face
but
still
he
strained
along
for
a
new
and
inspiring
thought
had
come
to
him
the
almighty
was
fighting
on
his
side
in
his
fierce
war
with
the
elements
the
devilish
powers
of
nature
had
been
trying
to
keep
him
back
from
saving
his
people
and
when
he
reached
the
house
of
rest
they
had
lulled
him
into
a
false
repose
but
god
had
sent
the
to
warn
him
that
his
dear
ones
were
still
in
danger
and
that
if
he
stayed
there
until
morning
he
would
arrive
at
his
journey
s
end
too
late
thinking
so
his
heart
grew
strong
for
he
felt
himself
in
the
immediate
presence
of
him
who
was
greater
than
the
greatest
tempest
but
after
some
two
hours
had
passed
the
sacred
fire
of
this
theory
began
to
fail
him
he
was
growing
faint
and
the
beatings
of
his
heart
were
suffocating
he
was
also
losing
his
way
in
the
deepening
snow
and
when
his
mare
stumbled
into
the
drifts
he
was
scarcely
strong
enough
to
drag
her
out
of
them
then
before
he
was
aware
of
it
the
voices
of
nature
were
speaking
to
him
again
why
did
you
leave
the
house
of
rest
the
sheriff
may
be
at
the
farm
but
no
buyers
can
get
there
and
without
people
to
bid
there
can
be
no
auction
just
as
this
thought
came
to
him
he
saw
a
red
speck
gleaming
through
the
darkness
and
he
turned
his
horse
s
head
in
the
direction
of
the
light
it
proved
to
be
in
the
window
of
a
and
finding
the
door
he
shouted
and
presently
a
man
came
out
to
him
i
ve
lost
my
way
he
cried
over
the
wailing
of
the
wind
tell
me
please
what
place
this
is
this
is
korastead
the
man
cried
back
and
then
a
woman
came
into
the
and
stood
behind
him
the
man
was
jon
vidalin
and
the
woman
was
gudrun
but
neither
of
them
knew
him
where
were
you
going
sir
said
jon
to
the
auction
at
thingvellir
you
are
not
so
far
out
of
your
road
then
bear
to
the
right
until
you
cross
the
river
and
then
follow
the
stones
until
you
come
to
the
chasm
christian
christiansson
hesitated
i
m
tired
having
ridden
from
reykjavik
and
it
doesn
t
seem
much
good
going
farther
nobody
else
will
be
fool
enough
to
travel
in
weather
like
this
and
without
people
to
bid
there
can
be
no
auction
so
if
you
can
give
me
shelter
and
a
you
are
welcome
to
the
shelter
sir
but
if
you
want
the
place
you
had
better
go
on
and
get
there
why
so
because
it
s
a
sheriff
s
sale
and
he
ll
sell
in
any
case
how
can
he
sell
if
there
s
nobody
to
buy
he
ll
bid
for
somebody
himself
sir
and
we
all
know
who
that
is
who
somebody
at
government
house
who
has
wanted
the
farm
these
fifteen
years
so
you
think
the
sheriff
will
hold
the
auction
morning
whether
anybody
is
there
or
not
sure
to
sir
the
fewer
there
are
to
bid
the
better
he
ll
be
pleased
and
the
bigger
the
minister
s
bargain
i
must
go
on
then
i
suppose
said
christian
christiansson
come
in
and
melt
yourself
first
said
jon
the
wind
is
going
down
it
will
be
quiet
presently
a
few
minutes
later
christian
christiansson
was
drinking
hot
coffee
in
the
while
jon
and
gudrun
talked
of
the
family
at
the
we
were
servants
with
the
family
for
ten
years
so
we
know
them
well
sir
said
jon
poor
old
anna
said
gudrun
she
would
be
welcome
to
anything
i
have
but
with
the
boys
growing
up
we
haven
t
a
bed
to
spare
in
the
badstofa
there
s
an
adopted
daughter
isn
t
there
there
is
sir
and
anybody
would
be
glad
to
have
her
for
a
helper
but
the
master
won
t
hear
of
letting
her
go
elin
shall
be
servant
to
nobody
he
says
it
isn
t
magnus
stephenson
s
fault
if
misfortune
has
overtaken
him
said
jon
he
has
the
strength
of
samson
and
has
done
the
work
of
six
men
how
does
he
bear
his
troubles
badly
said
gudrun
he
never
goes
to
church
now
or
reads
the
prayers
at
home
either
yes
said
jon
he
has
lost
his
religion
poor
fellow
and
when
a
man
loses
that
he
loses
everything
you
know
people
are
afraid
of
him
said
gudrun
he
looks
like
a
man
with
no
luck
and
he
is
always
beating
his
arms
about
him
and
driving
away
the
good
spirits
that
walk
by
a
man
s
side
and
what
do
people
say
is
the
cause
of
the
change
in
him
the
bank
and
bad
times
said
jon
and
a
bad
brother
said
gudrun
his
brother
is
dead
and
the
old
mistress
has
made
a
saint
of
him
but
she
daren
t
mention
his
name
before
magnus
or
he
gets
up
and
goes
out
of
the
house
does
he
hate
him
so
much
then
there
was
a
time
when
i
believe
in
my
heart
he
would
have
killed
him
said
jon
christian
christiansson
started
up
and
prepared
to
go
on
to
thingvellir
although
his
limbs
would
scarcely
cross
the
saddle
or
his
swollen
fingers
hold
the
reins
again
his
heart
had
fallen
low
and
the
hope
with
which
he
had
begun
his
journey
the
hope
of
a
joyful
reunion
at
the
end
of
it
was
now
gone
the
intensity
of
magnus
s
feeling
made
it
impossible
that
he
should
reveal
himself
to
his
people
if
he
rode
up
to
the
door
and
said
i
am
oscar
the
report
of
my
death
was
false
and
i
have
come
back
rich
and
prosperous
what
would
magnus
say
he
would
say
your
father
is
dead
your
wife
is
in
her
grave
your
mother
and
your
child
have
gone
through
poverty
and
perhaps
want
and
all
the
consequence
of
your
transgressions
do
you
think
that
your
miserable
money
will
make
amends
and
then
his
brother
would
fling
him
back
into
the
road
not
could
he
make
himself
known
not
at
all
events
perhaps
when
the
sale
would
be
over
and
the
sheriff
gone
and
he
had
smoothed
the
way
and
made
sure
of
his
welcome
but
now
he
must
go
to
the
inn
like
any
other
traveler
who
had
come
there
to
be
present
at
the
auction
and
to
bid
for
the
estate
seeing
his
course
clear
in
this
way
his
heart
rose
again
and
he
pushed
on
with
a
better
will
the
storm
had
subsided
and
when
he
came
to
the
sudden
mouth
of
the
almanagja
the
wind
dropped
altogether
and
it
was
almost
as
if
some
vast
volcano
in
the
sky
had
poured
its
lava
over
the
earth
in
snow
the
chasm
itself
was
full
of
memories
memories
of
the
day
of
his
triumph
the
day
of
his
disgrace
but
icicles
hung
from
where
the
flags
of
the
nations
had
floated
and
drifts
of
snow
like
mighty
mushrooms
were
lying
in
the
holes
where
the
tents
had
been
he
remembered
the
witch
who
had
said
beware
of
your
brother
and
he
thought
of
the
white
face
that
had
broken
in
upon
the
dancing
in
the
breathless
calm
the
sky
came
out
and
it
spanned
the
brant
walls
like
a
majestical
roof
studded
with
stars
but
he
stumbled
in
the
darkness
on
to
the
frozen
surface
of
the
drowning
pool
and
almost
rode
up
to
the
spot
where
he
had
sat
with
helga
at
the
bridge
that
crossed
the
frozen
waterfall
he
caught
his
first
sight
of
the
lighted
windows
of
the
and
then
his
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
his
mother
his
brother
and
his
little
daughter
were
there
and
he
had
been
ten
years
preparing
to
join
them
but
now
that
he
was
so
near
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
go
on
would
his
mother
recognize
him
she
who
had
read
his
features
first
and
known
him
from
the
cradle
up
he
was
afraid
she
would
and
then
in
the
tumult
of
his
tossing
heart
he
was
afraid
she
would
not
nobody
in
iceland
had
known
him
hitherto
and
now
he
was
aware
that
he
was
leas
like
himself
than
ever
for
seeing
his
face
in
a
glass
as
he
came
out
of
korastead
he
saw
that
his
lips
were
swollen
and
his
eyes
bloodshot
with
the
heavy
labor
of
that
awful
day
he
had
crunched
through
the
broken
ice
of
the
river
below
the
bridge
and
reached
the
silent
snow
of
the
pathway
to
the
farm
when
the
door
opened
and
two
men
came
out
of
the
house
the
sheriff
and
the
pastor
he
thought
he
drew
rein
and
they
did
not
hear
him
but
when
they
had
taken
the
path
to
the
parsonage
the
dogs
inside
began
to
bark
the
palpitation
of
his
heart
was
almost
choking
him
and
it
would
have
taken
little
to
make
him
turn
about
and
fly
how
long
he
stood
there
whether
five
minutes
or
ten
he
never
rightly
knew
a
hundred
thoughts
more
wild
than
the
whirling
snow
were
tossing
within
his
brain
but
thinking
at
length
that
almighty
god
who
had
brought
him
through
the
perils
of
that
fearful
day
defeating
the
designs
of
the
devil
and
of
the
elements
and
driving
him
before
his
mighty
will
as
before
a
greater
hurricane
could
not
have
led
him
there
at
last
to
any
end
save
a
good
one
he
urged
his
horse
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
raised
his
whip
to
the
window
magnus
stephenson
had
indeed
lost
his
religion
for
fifteen
years
he
had
believed
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
that
everybody
in
this
life
was
treated
according
to
his
deserts
that
if
you
did
right
you
were
rewarded
sooner
or
later
and
if
you
did
wrong
you
were
punished
but
experience
of
the
world
had
little
by
little
and
year
by
year
inflicted
upon
his
profound
faith
in
the
rule
of
conscience
the
most
inexplicable
contradictions
the
man
who
lived
a
good
life
was
not
being
rewarded
and
the
man
who
lived
an
evil
one
was
not
being
punished
what
then
was
there
left
to
believe
that
there
was
no
god
in
the
universe
at
all
or
that
if
there
were
a
god
he
did
nothing
magnus
stephenson
had
tried
to
do
what
was
right
he
had
taken
up
the
burdens
which
others
laid
down
and
he
had
struggled
on
with
a
strong
heart
for
fifteen
years
he
had
labored
like
a
slave
and
though
his
arrears
of
debt
constantly
accumulated
he
had
never
allowed
himself
to
believe
that
the
end
was
coming
on
the
mortgage
was
monstrous
the
interest
was
exorbitant
and
the
bank
would
come
to
see
that
more
than
he
got
out
of
the
land
and
stock
it
was
impossible
for
man
to
make
but
the
deed
of
execution
had
been
served
on
him
at
length
the
advertisements
of
the
sale
had
been
published
and
the
two
preliminary
auctions
had
been
held
then
as
if
in
a
moment
the
man
s
religion
had
disappeared
and
his
soul
had
sent
up
that
sublime
if
blasphemous
cry
which
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
has
borne
to
heaven
the
lamentation
and
protest
of
humanity
against
the
misery
of
man
i
have
obeyed
your
laws
i
have
lived
a
good
life
i
have
assisted
the
poor
and
helped
the
oppressed
i
have
shared
my
bread
with
the
orphan
and
protected
the
widow
what
have
you
done
for
me
in
the
grim
silence
which
follows
that
ghastly
question
it
is
more
than
a
man
s
religion
that
disappears
and
magnus
stephenson
s
belief
in
right
and
wrong
his
faith
in
justice
in
conscience
and
in
virtue
had
gone
down
together
leaving
nothing
but
the
fierce
convulsions
of
his
animal
nature
from
the
moment
the
sheriff
arrived
to
make
the
inventory
he
had
done
little
but
sit
in
the
hall
and
drink
he
sat
there
all
day
long
with
his
coarse
over
his
boots
his
sullen
face
to
the
stove
his
hands
deep
in
his
trouser
pockets
his
broad
forehead
heavily
wrinkled
under
the
rough
stubble
of
his
hair
his
massive
jaw
resting
on
his
breast
and
his
mighty
loins
making
the
chair
creak
as
he
moved
and
turned
at
intervals
during
the
day
his
mother
tried
to
comfort
him
don
t
be
too
downhearted
magnus
said
anna
the
stars
shine
when
it
is
dark
you
know
isn
t
it
dark
enough
yet
said
magnus
and
he
laughed
bitterly
and
drank
again
at
intervals
elin
came
to
him
also
she
was
a
tall
girl
now
nearly
sixteen
years
of
age
with
a
whisper
of
womanhood
in
her
face
and
form
but
coming
in
her
short
blue
skirt
and
buckled
shoes
she
would
slide
into
a
seat
on
magnus
s
knee
and
slipping
one
arm
about
his
neck
put
the
other
hand
on
his
hot
forehead
and
try
to
soothe
him
in
her
motherly
little
way
but
there
there
that
will
do
go
to
your
grandmother
i
m
tired
he
would
say
early
in
the
day
he
had
been
tormented
by
thoughts
of
the
travelers
who
might
come
from
a
distance
to
stay
in
order
to
be
present
at
the
auction
and
in
his
mind
s
eye
he
saw
the
full
of
them
with
their
indifferent
talk
and
heartless
laughter
and
himself
in
his
impotent
rage
itching
with
a
desire
to
fling
them
into
the
road
but
when
the
storm
broke
his
fears
on
that
head
were
appeased
and
while
the
wind
and
snow
wailed
and
wept
about
the
house
he
sat
for
hours
alone
in
a
gloomy
and
tragic
pence
besides
the
sheriff
the
only
person
who
visited
the
house
that
day
was
the
pastor
and
he
came
as
late
as
ten
at
night
to
take
the
sheriff
back
to
lodge
with
him
by
that
time
all
that
was
left
of
the
broken
household
had
gathered
in
the
hall
where
magnus
still
sat
before
the
stove
while
the
sheriff
with
anna
and
elin
stood
by
the
dresser
making
an
end
of
the
inventory
ugh
what
a
night
said
the
pastor
stamping
the
snow
off
his
stockings
you
re
not
likely
to
be
brought
out
of
bed
by
travelers
on
a
night
like
this
that
s
some
consolation
isn
t
it
he
was
a
garrulous
old
man
with
a
shallow
heart
and
a
shallow
head
who
chewed
the
cud
of
his
humdrum
livelihood
with
content
on
his
stipend
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
so
this
is
to
be
your
last
night
in
the
old
home
anna
what
a
pity
well
tapping
his
naked
came
i
out
of
my
mother
s
womb
and
naked
shall
i
return
thither
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
magnus
moved
his
chair
impatiently
and
made
contemptuous
noises
in
his
throat
i
ve
known
the
old
house
through
all
its
days
of
joy
and
sorrow
for
years
anna
ever
since
your
poor
father
that
s
dead
i
buried
him
myself
god
rest
his
soul
god
rest
his
soul
said
anna
ever
since
the
day
he
gave
you
away
as
a
bride
and
a
nervous
blushing
little
bride
you
were
too
again
magnus
shuffled
in
his
chair
and
made
noises
in
his
throat
i
remember
it
so
well
because
it
was
the
same
year
that
your
father
s
big
barn
was
burnt
down
and
his
cousin
jorgen
was
found
dead
in
the
chasm
what
a
sensation
that
made
what
inquiries
what
examining
witnesses
your
predecessor
had
something
on
his
hands
in
those
days
sheriff
the
sheriff
muttered
some
commonplace
and
magnus
kicked
at
the
smouldering
wood
in
the
stove
suspicion
actually
fell
upon
your
father
you
remember
and
because
he
had
been
drinking
and
was
such
an
ungovernable
man
when
he
was
drunk
oh
for
the
lord
s
sake
let
s
have
done
with
this
cried
magnus
magnus
stephenson
protested
the
pastor
if
we
are
in
trouble
let
us
behave
like
god
s
rational
creatures
rational
hell
growled
magnus
whereupon
the
sheriff
to
avoid
further
friction
closed
his
book
with
a
bang
saying
he
had
finished
and
was
ready
to
go
magnus
sat
quiet
while
the
sheriff
a
man
with
the
eyes
of
a
ferret
put
on
his
and
cloak
and
then
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
and
a
somber
fire
in
his
eyes
he
turned
and
said
is
it
all
over
sir
yes
it
was
a
long
job
but
it
s
over
at
last
said
the
sheriff
i
mean
said
magnus
is
it
certain
that
the
auction
must
take
place
quite
certain
there
has
never
been
any
doubt
of
it
that
i
know
of
look
here
sir
said
magnus
heaving
up
to
his
feet
a
sheriff
can
do
a
good
deal
if
he
cares
to
use
his
influence
give
me
another
chance
and
you
shall
have
everything
i
owe
i
ve
had
five
bad
years
in
succession
no
wonder
i
fell
into
arrears
last
spring
i
lost
forty
lambs
in
a
single
night
and
next
morning
two
heifers
and
a
calf
the
floods
came
in
the
autumn
too
and
half
my
hay
was
swept
into
the
lake
but
weather
like
that
can
t
last
forever
we
are
sure
to
have
a
run
of
good
years
next
give
me
four
years
more
sir
and
you
shall
see
what
i
can
do
the
thing
is
past
praying
for
said
the
sheriff
don
t
say
that
sir
listen
my
people
have
farmed
this
place
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
a
man
doesn
t
like
to
be
the
one
to
lose
it
my
own
flesh
and
blood
are
in
the
land
too
the
strength
of
my
muscles
and
the
sweat
of
my
brow
give
me
three
years
more
sir
just
three
impossible
said
the
sheriff
sheriff
come
this
way
said
magnus
drawing
the
man
aside
by
the
arm
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
so
that
the
women
might
not
hear
i
don
t
care
a
straw
about
myself
i
ll
get
along
somehow
and
if
i
don
t
it
doesn
t
matter
but
there
s
the
child
she
ought
to
inherit
the
farm
and
she
s
an
orphan
but
she
ll
get
nothing
give
me
a
chance
for
the
child
s
sake
sheriff
don
t
be
hard
on
me
sell
up
half
my
stock
to
pay
part
of
the
interest
and
let
me
have
two
years
more
only
two
you
know
quite
well
that
the
mortgage
is
on
the
loose
property
as
well
as
the
land
said
the
sheriff
how
can
i
sap
away
the
security
as
for
the
girl
she
s
young
and
strong
let
her
go
into
service
magnus
bit
his
lip
in
an
effort
to
control
himself
and
then
he
said
you
are
quite
right
sir
the
girl
and
i
can
take
care
of
ourselves
but
there
s
the
old
mother
she
was
born
in
this
house
and
she
expected
to
die
here
i
shouldn
t
so
much
mind
if
she
were
gone
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
s
not
well
now
sir
give
me
one
more
year
sheriff
one
single
year
it
s
no
use
wasting
words
said
the
sheriff
matters
have
gone
too
far
the
only
thing
i
can
do
now
is
what
sir
if
you
can
pay
me
the
whole
of
the
interest
before
nine
o
clock
morning
i
can
stop
the
sale
on
my
own
responsibility
eight
thousand
crowns
said
magnus
raising
his
voice
to
a
cry
of
derision
you
ask
me
to
find
you
eight
thousand
crowns
before
nine
o
clock
morning
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
find
you
the
moon
then
let
us
say
no
more
on
the
subject
the
bank
has
been
very
patient
very
indulgent
the
bank
cried
magnus
in
the
wild
defiance
of
his
despair
has
the
bank
got
a
mother
has
the
bank
got
a
child
no
the
bank
is
a
great
grinding
monster
without
bowels
of
compassion
for
anybody
god
damn
the
bank
and
all
its
fools
and
flunkeys
magnus
stephenson
said
the
pastor
raising
his
little
fat
hand
i
will
ask
you
to
remember
that
a
clergyman
is
in
your
company
and
if
you
take
god
s
name
in
vain
take
god
s
name
in
vain
you
do
that
often
enough
you
do
it
every
sunday
i
ll
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
you
magnus
stephenson
for
i
know
you
are
deeply
tainted
with
skepticism
and
since
you
ceased
to
come
to
church
church
you
pray
to
god
in
your
churches
and
what
does
he
do
for
you
what
does
he
do
for
any
one
what
has
he
done
for
me
if
your
life
had
been
straight
and
pure
god
would
have
watched
over
you
and
hasn
t
it
haven
t
i
tried
to
do
what
was
right
and
yet
god
is
seeing
me
sold
up
and
turned
out
and
my
dear
ones
left
to
die
in
a
ditch
god
chastises
his
own
and
if
we
only
have
faith
in
him
faith
in
him
where
is
he
is
he
in
the
northlands
i
have
never
heard
of
it
is
he
in
the
southlands
i
ve
never
seen
him
here
though
i
ve
seen
the
devil
often
enough
he
s
in
the
clouds
if
he
s
anywhere
and
that
s
no
use
to
me
magnus
stephenson
if
god
is
on
the
earth
let
him
do
something
here
s
his
chance
you
call
the
poor
his
people
don
t
you
well
i
ve
fed
and
sheltered
his
people
for
fifteen
years
and
now
i
want
feeding
and
sheltering
myself
i
want
eight
thousand
crowns
before
nine
o
clock
morning
and
if
god
can
do
anything
in
the
world
let
him
find
me
the
money
and
save
my
mother
and
my
child
from
starvation
but
he
can
t
do
it
he
can
do
nothing
magnus
stephenson
said
the
little
clergyman
raising
his
little
fat
hand
again
when
you
come
to
stand
before
the
great
white
throne
god
will
have
something
to
forgive
you
pastor
peter
when
i
come
to
stand
before
the
great
white
throne
i
shall
have
something
to
forgive
god
it
seems
to
me
blasphemy
blasphemy
cried
the
pastor
and
as
he
followed
the
sheriff
out
of
the
house
magnus
sent
a
ringing
laugh
of
contempt
after
him
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
at
the
same
moment
two
that
had
been
lying
at
the
door
with
their
snouts
on
their
paws
as
if
anxious
to
join
the
uproar
began
to
growl
and
bark
whereupon
magnus
who
had
always
been
a
lover
of
animals
kicked
them
savagely
and
then
reeled
back
to
his
seat
by
the
stove
the
strangers
being
gone
and
the
little
family
alone
elin
who
had
been
standing
by
the
dresser
went
over
to
magnus
and
slid
into
her
seat
on
his
knee
and
said
you
must
not
think
about
me
uncle
magnus
wherever
you
have
to
go
i
will
go
too
and
what
is
good
enough
for
you
is
good
enough
for
elin
and
then
who
knows
what
may
happen
before
the
sheriff
comes
back
in
the
morning
this
is
new
year
s
eve
you
know
all
good
things
come
at
new
year
miracles
come
at
new
year
uncle
but
the
sweet
buoyancy
of
her
girlish
spirits
which
had
been
the
sunshine
of
his
life
for
so
many
years
was
failing
him
at
last
and
putting
her
aside
with
petulant
expressions
he
got
up
and
went
out
to
the
back
then
anna
who
had
been
sitting
in
silence
by
the
table
took
the
bible
and
four
from
the
corner
cupboard
and
rang
the
bell
for
prayers
i
wonder
why
i
did
that
she
said
i
forgot
that
eric
was
gone
i
hope
he
found
shelter
somewhere
poor
boy
i
should
pity
a
dog
that
had
to
be
out
of
doors
on
a
night
like
this
and
then
elin
in
default
of
magnus
read
the
lesson
which
anna
had
marked
for
her
it
was
the
psalm
beginning
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
and
when
the
short
chapter
was
finished
the
two
women
stood
up
and
sang
a
hymn
elin
in
the
silvery
treble
of
youth
and
anna
in
the
husky
tones
of
age
they
two
only
in
the
lonely
house
among
the
solitary
hills
with
nothing
about
them
but
the
darkness
and
the
snow
nothing
but
that
and
the
immeasurable
wings
of
god
happy
the
man
whose
tender
care
relieves
the
poor
distressed
when
he
by
trouble
s
compassed
round
the
lord
will
give
him
rest
anna
sat
down
when
the
hymn
was
ended
but
elin
continued
to
stand
by
the
table
and
closing
her
eyes
with
her
innocent
face
uplifted
she
said
a
little
prayer
for
herself
o
father
she
said
bless
uncle
magnus
so
that
he
may
fear
no
evil
show
me
how
to
help
him
so
that
i
may
not
be
a
burden
and
a
care
dear
jesus
send
the
miracle
that
will
save
uncle
magnus
and
grandma
and
me
it
will
be
such
a
little
thing
to
you
but
such
a
great
great
thing
to
us
and
we
shall
all
be
so
happy
and
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
forever
for
christ
s
sake
amen
then
she
opened
her
trustful
eyes
and
said
i
m
sure
he
will
grandma
and
kissing
anna
she
said
good
night
in
a
cheery
voice
and
went
off
to
bed
prayers
being
over
magnus
returned
to
the
hall
and
began
to
rake
out
the
stove
for
the
night
the
clouds
hung
heavier
on
him
than
ever
and
thinking
to
banish
them
anna
talked
of
elin
she
grows
more
and
more
like
her
mother
and
sometimes
i
think
it
can
only
be
a
dream
that
our
dear
thora
is
dead
if
you
had
heard
her
praying
for
the
miracle
it
would
have
filled
your
heart
brimful
she
has
gone
to
bed
quite
certain
that
the
miracle
will
come
before
morning
it
would
to
be
a
miracle
to
help
us
now
mother
said
magnus
and
miracles
don
t
happen
except
such
of
them
as
we
make
for
ourselves
what
do
you
mean
by
that
magnus
said
anna
lighting
the
candles
i
mean
if
i
had
to
live
my
life
over
again
i
shouldn
t
try
to
do
what
is
right
mother
you
wouldn
t
do
what
is
wrong
would
you
there
is
no
wrong
and
no
right
mother
there
is
only
what
is
best
and
if
i
had
to
begin
over
again
i
should
do
what
was
best
best
for
myself
and
for
the
people
about
me
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
saying
magnus
there
are
moments
when
it
might
to
be
best
to
rob
even
to
kill
and
why
not
said
magnus
he
was
bolting
the
door
if
a
man
came
to
this
house
with
eight
thousand
crowns
in
his
pocket
do
you
think
i
should
hesitate
to
take
them
my
son
you
don
t
mean
it
i
do
you
are
driven
to
despair
magnus
and
a
despairing
man
s
words
belong
to
the
wind
if
i
thought
you
meant
it
i
should
die
i
should
die
this
very
minute
she
was
crying
and
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
magnus
said
never
mind
mother
it
doesn
t
matter
whether
i
meant
it
or
not
the
temptation
isn
t
likely
to
come
to
me
give
me
the
candle
and
let
us
go
to
bed
you
have
borne
a
terrible
burden
magnus
and
if
i
could
only
have
helped
you
to
bear
it
you
have
mother
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
and
elin
i
should
have
gone
under
ten
years
ago
your
father
knew
he
had
robbed
you
of
your
inheritance
and
perhaps
that
helped
to
kill
him
in
the
end
it
wasn
t
father
s
fault
altogether
tried
to
do
what
was
right
too
but
the
poor
wretch
who
comes
after
the
prodigal
gleans
in
a
barren
field
you
know
with
their
candles
in
hand
they
were
turning
to
go
anna
to
the
badstofa
above
and
magnus
to
the
off
the
hall
when
the
dogs
who
had
risen
again
and
were
snuffling
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
began
to
growl
and
bark
there
s
somebody
coming
said
magnus
a
moment
later
there
was
a
sharp
knock
at
the
window
as
with
a
metal
end
of
a
and
a
tremulous
voice
outside
making
the
customary
icelandic
salutation
god
be
with
you
they
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
surprise
while
backward
thoughts
galloped
through
their
minds
and
then
magnus
forgetting
to
give
the
customary
reply
walked
back
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
there
was
a
dull
thud
of
heavy
feet
on
the
outside
steps
and
at
the
next
moment
a
man
stood
on
the
threshold
he
seemed
to
be
an
old
man
for
his
eyebrows
beard
and
mustache
and
as
much
as
could
be
seen
of
his
hair
under
the
peaked
hood
of
his
ulster
were
white
with
snow
one
moment
he
stood
there
as
if
breathless
after
his
journey
looking
from
magnus
to
the
mother
and
from
the
mother
to
magnus
then
he
said
in
the
same
tremulous
voice
as
before
can
i
have
a
bed
here
and
shelter
for
my
horse
it
seemed
to
anna
that
he
spoke
to
her
but
instead
of
answering
immediately
she
looked
across
at
magnus
with
helpless
eyes
that
were
full
of
inexpressible
fears
magnus
looked
back
at
his
mother
and
hesitated
for
an
instant
while
he
held
the
door
open
with
his
hand
then
come
in
sir
he
said
and
the
stranger
stepped
into
the
house
ball
no
question
makes
of
ayes
and
noes
right
or
left
as
strikes
the
player
goes
he
who
tossed
you
down
into
the
field
knows
about
it
all
he
knows
he
the
little
mare
is
hot
she
ll
want
a
rub
down
and
a
rest
before
you
give
her
a
feed
i
ll
see
to
that
sir
said
magnus
and
he
went
out
and
pulled
the
door
after
him
christian
christiansson
had
taken
two
paces
into
the
hall
and
was
standing
there
like
a
man
who
is
dazed
his
heart
was
thumping
against
his
ribs
and
his
pulse
was
beating
violently
and
he
felt
that
he
would
fall
if
he
took
another
step
forward
so
often
had
he
pictured
himself
in
that
place
that
he
could
not
at
first
believe
in
the
reality
coming
out
of
the
darkness
the
light
of
the
candles
dazzled
him
but
he
looked
round
the
room
trying
to
remember
at
one
glance
he
took
in
everything
the
old
portraits
on
the
wall
the
old
bornholme
clock
in
the
corner
the
stove
and
the
armchair
in
front
of
it
and
fresh
from
the
warm
comfort
of
government
house
the
seemed
bare
and
bleak
this
sent
a
chill
pang
of
remorse
to
his
mind
and
the
pain
of
conscience
increased
when
he
looked
at
his
mother
her
hair
was
white
that
had
once
been
dark
and
her
face
which
had
been
full
of
the
loveliness
of
love
and
the
beauty
of
happiness
was
scored
deep
with
lines
of
suffering
his
heart
yearned
over
her
and
notwithstanding
his
determination
not
to
reveal
his
identity
until
morning
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
restrain
himself
from
saying
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
emotion
that
was
mastering
him
mother
don
t
you
know
me
i
am
oscar
and
then
throwing
his
arms
about
her
dear
neck
as
he
had
always
meant
to
do
meantime
anna
who
had
recovered
her
and
was
lighting
the
lamp
that
swung
from
the
ceiling
glanced
across
at
the
and
thought
he
s
nearly
frozen
stiff
and
no
wonder
with
that
thought
she
bustled
about
to
rekindle
the
stove
and
called
on
him
to
remove
his
clothing
won
t
you
take
off
your
cloak
and
boots
sir
she
said
and
though
the
question
was
so
commonplace
he
could
not
answer
immediately
for
his
voice
would
not
come
your
cloak
and
boots
sir
and
i
ll
put
them
to
dry
by
the
stove
ah
yes
of
course
certainly
she
stood
by
him
while
he
threw
off
his
ulster
and
shook
the
snow
from
his
hair
and
beard
emerging
a
younger
and
stronger
man
but
she
only
thought
a
stranger
i
suppose
why
does
he
travel
in
this
weather
when
he
had
pulled
off
his
she
brought
him
a
pair
of
magnus
s
slippers
and
said
you
must
have
had
a
terrible
ride
sir
it
was
pretty
bad
certainly
he
said
and
after
that
he
got
on
better
a
gentleman
must
have
been
anxious
to
get
on
with
his
journey
to
travel
on
a
day
like
this
i
was
i
had
something
to
do
at
the
end
of
it
have
you
come
far
sir
altogether
yes
very
far
from
reykjavik
perhaps
farther
than
that
from
england
from
england
from
london
as
he
stooped
to
put
on
the
slippers
he
thought
his
mother
was
looking
at
him
and
he
trembled
between
fear
and
hope
of
being
recognized
i
suppose
he
said
his
head
was
down
i
suppose
you
ve
never
been
as
far
as
that
landlady
no
sir
nor
any
of
your
family
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
say
this
but
his
mother
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
she
was
on
her
knees
breaking
sticks
into
the
stove
sit
up
and
warm
yourself
sir
my
son
raked
out
the
fire
but
these
sticks
will
burn
presently
you
are
here
on
business
i
suppose
yes
i
m
here
on
business
anna
thought
of
the
auction
and
waited
for
the
stranger
to
speak
of
it
when
he
did
not
do
so
she
said
travelers
come
from
england
to
buy
sheep
and
ponies
but
they
don
t
often
come
in
the
winter
sir
still
he
did
not
speak
he
was
thinking
of
elin
and
looking
round
for
any
trace
of
her
and
rising
from
the
stove
anna
said
but
you
ll
be
hungry
after
your
long
ride
what
can
i
give
you
to
eat
anything
at
all
anything
you
have
ready
i
m
afraid
i
have
nothing
ready
that
is
to
say
nothing
that
is
good
enough
for
the
like
of
you
sir
as
soon
as
he
could
find
his
voice
after
that
he
said
don
t
you
always
keep
smoked
mutton
in
an
iceland
house
well
yes
if
that
will
do
sir
i
should
like
it
above
all
things
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
he
thought
his
mother
was
looking
at
him
again
then
perhaps
you
are
an
icelander
she
said
yes
i
m
an
icelander
he
answered
what
is
your
name
another
wild
impulse
to
reveal
himself
immediately
to
his
mother
nearly
swept
down
his
fears
for
he
was
choking
with
a
sense
of
duplicity
and
his
conscience
was
fighting
in
contrary
ways
but
after
a
moment
his
prudence
conquered
and
with
a
gulp
in
his
throat
he
said
they
call
me
christian
christiansson
well
it
s
lucky
you
found
us
up
sir
we
were
on
the
point
of
going
to
bed
i
suppose
the
other
members
of
your
family
are
gone
already
there
s
only
one
besides
what
you
ve
seen
my
granddaughter
and
she
had
just
gone
off
as
you
came
in
sir
he
looked
at
her
as
she
was
crossing
in
front
of
him
and
saw
that
she
was
wearing
the
brooch
which
he
had
given
her
when
he
came
back
from
oxford
that
sent
all
the
blood
to
his
head
again
and
he
was
saying
before
he
was
aware
of
it
do
you
know
landlady
i
ve
slept
in
this
house
before
it
must
have
been
a
long
time
ago
then
i
don
t
remember
you
it
was
a
long
time
ago
that
pointing
to
the
portrait
of
anna
on
the
wall
that
is
a
portrait
of
yourself
isn
t
it
it
used
to
be
but
i
was
younger
when
it
was
like
me
sir
a
sudden
softening
came
into
his
voice
as
he
replied
it
was
exactly
like
you
when
i
saw
you
last
landlady
then
you
ve
not
been
here
for
ten
years
at
least
sir
quite
ten
years
he
answered
and
that
pointing
to
the
portrait
of
the
governor
is
a
portrait
of
your
husband
it
must
be
more
than
ten
years
since
you
were
here
sir
for
my
husband
is
more
than
twelve
years
in
his
grave
it
is
more
than
ten
years
in
fact
it
is
sixteen
years
nearly
sixteen
she
looked
fixedly
at
him
for
a
moment
and
something
in
her
memory
seemed
to
stir
for
her
bosom
heaved
perceptibly
but
she
only
said
with
a
deep
sigh
we
ve
seen
trouble
since
you
traveled
in
these
parts
before
sir
ah
yes
i
ve
heard
of
it
i
heard
of
it
in
reykjavik
you
had
a
son
that
was
my
son
who
opened
the
door
to
you
but
you
had
another
son
a
younger
son
yes
but
we
never
talk
of
him
now
sir
who
s
portrait
is
that
in
your
brooch
landlady
it
s
his
he
is
dead
died
in
disgrace
didn
t
he
who
knows
that
sir
man
sees
the
deed
they
say
but
god
the
circumstance
they
think
hard
things
of
him
in
reykjavik
though
they
say
he
robbed
his
father
of
every
penny
when
he
went
away
and
never
sent
anything
home
toward
the
maintenance
of
his
child
it
needs
no
skill
to
wound
the
defenceless
said
anna
bridling
up
the
father
robbed
himself
to
save
his
son
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
and
as
for
never
sending
anything
home
for
the
child
the
poor
boy
had
nothing
to
send
for
he
was
poor
himself
sir
so
you
found
that
out
did
you
after
he
was
dead
we
did
one
of
his
father
s
english
friends
wrote
to
tell
us
so
and
all
the
time
he
had
been
writing
letters
to
me
to
say
how
busy
he
was
and
how
well
he
was
succeeding
just
to
keep
up
my
heart
and
save
me
from
fretting
the
mother
s
lingering
fondness
for
her
prodigal
was
rising
in
her
eyes
and
breaking
in
her
voice
and
she
was
trying
to
turn
away
but
he
could
not
let
her
go
what
a
pity
his
father
didn
t
live
long
enough
to
hear
that
it
would
have
softened
his
heart
toward
him
perhaps
it
didn
t
need
softening
sir
not
at
the
end
at
all
events
his
father
forgave
him
did
he
he
died
thinking
his
son
had
become
a
great
man
and
had
justified
all
his
hopes
and
atoned
for
everything
it
was
only
a
delusion
sir
but
it
made
him
very
happy
your
son
was
a
musician
wasn
t
he
yes
sir
and
from
the
time
he
was
a
child
he
used
to
scribble
things
and
call
them
his
compositions
the
pieces
of
paper
always
disappeared
and
i
never
knew
what
had
become
of
them
but
when
his
father
was
lying
dead
i
found
out
where
they
were
and
where
were
they
in
his
poor
father
s
hands
christian
christiansson
had
gone
on
and
on
while
the
hot
blood
throbbed
in
his
brain
struggling
between
the
desire
to
reveal
himself
and
the
fear
of
doing
so
but
he
was
drawn
up
at
last
by
a
stifling
sense
of
his
own
unworthiness
and
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
said
the
man
who
could
do
wrong
to
a
father
who
loved
him
like
that
must
have
been
a
scoundrel
a
scoundrel
and
he
deserved
everything
that
happened
to
him
he
was
nothing
of
the
kind
sir
said
anna
he
may
have
done
wrong
i
m
not
defending
him
but
a
boy
was
never
born
into
the
world
everybody
loved
him
and
he
loved
everybody
and
as
for
me
christian
christiansson
recovered
himself
at
the
sound
of
anna
s
faltering
words
god
bless
her
he
thought
and
his
heart
danced
to
a
new
song
but
he
only
said
with
a
perceptible
lowering
of
his
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
naturally
his
mother
can
not
think
so
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ve
heard
a
good
word
for
him
since
i
came
to
iceland
i
hadn
t
meant
to
speak
of
him
at
all
sir
i
never
do
when
my
other
son
is
near
hush
he
is
coming
back
but
the
noise
which
they
heard
behind
them
was
that
of
the
opening
and
closing
of
a
bedroom
not
a
kitchen
door
and
it
was
followed
by
the
light
footstep
of
a
girl
whereupon
anna
said
elin
i
thought
you
were
in
bed
and
asleep
my
child
i
was
but
i
awoke
and
heard
you
had
a
visitor
so
i
got
up
to
help
grandma
christian
christiansson
trembled
from
head
to
foot
the
silvery
voice
at
his
back
seemed
to
come
to
him
from
across
a
wide
abyss
for
it
was
a
familiar
voice
but
vague
as
with
the
mist
of
dreams
and
dim
as
with
the
clouds
of
night
this
is
my
granddaughter
sir
said
anna
and
then
christian
christiansson
turned
and
saw
her
a
young
girl
as
tall
as
a
woman
with
fair
complexion
a
soft
smiling
face
and
beautiful
blue
eyes
she
wore
a
laced
bodice
a
collar
a
hufa
a
tassel
plaited
hair
and
looked
like
the
living
picture
of
what
her
mother
had
been
when
he
came
from
college
it
was
his
daughter
his
little
elin
whom
he
had
traveled
so
far
to
see
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
the
cruel
years
had
rolled
back
in
a
moment
and
it
was
thora
returned
to
life
well
now
that
you
are
here
you
had
better
lay
the
table
said
anna
yes
grandma
said
the
girl
put
on
the
smoked
mutton
and
the
rullapilsa
and
the
rikling
while
i
go
to
the
to
make
coffee
yes
grandma
make
yourself
at
home

christiansson
my
granddaughter
will
wait
on
you
i
will
he
tried
to
say
but
his
voice
would
scarcely
come
anna
being
gone
he
sat
for
some
moments
looking
at
elin
while
she
tripped
from
dresser
to
table
and
in
and
out
of
the
pantry
spreading
the
cloth
and
laying
the
plates
and
the
food
the
girl
was
so
simple
so
natural
so
free
from
that
she
seemed
to
be
hardly
aware
of
his
presence
for
she
hummed
to
herself
softly
as
if
some
in
her
breast
could
not
be
kept
quite
still
his
heart
swelled
and
throbbed
as
his
eyes
followed
her
about
and
when
she
left
the
room
the
light
seemed
to
fail
in
it
and
when
she
came
back
the
air
seemed
to
become
warm
in
the
dizzy
happiness
of
that
hour
he
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
a
daughter
in
every
one
of
the
fifteen
years
he
had
lived
without
her
and
now
that
she
was
near
so
close
his
hands
burned
and
itched
to
hold
her
he
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
say
my
child
my
child
doesn
t
something
tell
you
who
i
am
i
am
your
father
and
i
have
wanted
you
so
much
and
thought
of
you
so
often
and
now
i
have
come
to
fetch
you
and
we
shall
never
be
parted
again
but
between
fear
of
frightening
her
and
dread
of
disclosing
himself
all
he
could
do
was
to
conquer
the
fluttering
in
his
throat
and
say
your
name
is
elin
isn
t
it
yes
sir
said
the
girl
what
a
beautiful
name
it
is
too
eleen
your
father
chose
it
didn
t
he
i
have
never
heard
that
sir
did
grandmother
say
so
grandmother
and
i
he
stammered
have
been
talking
of
your
father
you
don
t
remember
him
oh
no
sir
he
died
when
i
was
quite
little
what
a
loss
that
must
have
been
to
you
my
child
i
can
t
say
that
sir
said
the
girl
because
you
see
uncle
magnus
has
been
the
same
as
a
father
to
me
all
my
life
and
i
have
never
known
any
difference
what
a
loss
to
your
father
himself
then
how
happy
you
would
have
made
him
and
how
proud
he
would
have
been
of
you
i
can
t
say
that
either
said
the
girl
again
because
he
lived
five
years
after
i
was
born
and
it
seems
he
never
took
any
notice
of
me
did
grandmother
tell
you
so
oh
no
sir
indeed
no
nor
uncle
magnus
neither
but
everybody
know
all
about
my
father
and
even
the
girls
at
school
knew
that
a
feeling
of
mortal
shame
came
over
him
and
the
warm
pulsing
place
in
his
breast
grew
still
and
cold
so
you
are
not
sorry
your
father
is
dead
elin
it
wouldn
t
be
right
to
say
that
sir
at
all
events
you
feel
no
love
for
him
i
never
knew
him
you
can
t
love
somebody
you
never
knew
can
you
perhaps
if
he
had
lived
longer
and
returned
home
i
might
have
come
to
love
him
but
i
don
t
see
how
i
could
if
what
people
say
about
him
is
true
what
do
they
say
my
child
they
say
he
was
unkind
to
my
mother
and
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
died
so
early
then
you
never
wish
you
could
have
seen
and
known
your
father
how
can
i
if
he
wasn
t
good
to
my
poor
mother
why
should
i
think
he
would
have
been
good
to
me
but
see
your
supper
is
ready
grandma
will
bring
the
coffee
presently
won
t
you
begin
with
the
meat
sir
he
sat
down
to
the
table
but
his
hunger
was
gone
for
a
moment
he
almost
wished
himself
back
in
the
black
night
from
which
he
had
come
the
girl
s
simple
words
had
been
ringing
the
of
his
expectations
he
had
left
her
all
these
years
to
the
keeping
and
care
of
others
could
he
expect
to
come
back
now
and
find
the
affection
he
had
forfeited
ah
no
he
had
come
too
late
too
late
but
just
as
one
part
of
the
plan
he
had
formed
for
himself
was
becoming
vague
and
shadowy
a
gleam
of
new
light
was
shot
into
his
brain
and
his
heart
rose
with
a
bound
didn
t
grandma
call
you
christian
christiansson
asked
the
girl
yes
he
answered
ever
hear
that
name
before
my
child
the
girl
turned
to
him
with
a
face
glowing
with
excitement
and
said
everybody
in
iceland
has
heard
it
sir
it
is
the
same
as
the
name
of
the
great
composer
who
lives
in
england
a
deafening
tumult
of
joy
was
rising
within
him
and
he
said
so
you
you
have
heard
of
him
have
you
i
sing
his
songs
sir
they
are
beautiful
i
think
they
are
the
most
beautiful
songs
in
the
world
would
you
like
me
to
sing
one
of
them
while
you
eat
your
supper
will
you
i
should
like
to
she
said
and
before
he
could
catch
the
breath
which
had
been
suspended
she
had
slipped
off
like
a
shaft
of
moonlight
and
was
back
like
a
ray
of
the
sun
bringing
a
guitar
in
her
hands
this
was
my
mother
s
guitar
and
now
it
s
mine
and
it
s
such
a
good
one
she
said
and
with
the
utter
freedom
from
which
is
the
charm
of
children
she
sat
and
began
to
play
after
a
moment
she
stopped
with
her
head
aside
and
said
which
should
it
be
i
wonder
but
perhaps
you
know
them
all
and
would
like
me
to
sing
something
in
particular
his
face
was
down
the
waves
of
emotion
were
surging
through
and
through
him
sing
sing
anything
you
like
my
darling
he
replied
the
fluttered
earnestness
of
his
words
startled
her
for
a
moment
but
she
only
smiled
with
a
new
sweetness
and
began
to
sing
first
in
low
clear
and
then
in
a
high
tremulous
treble
that
was
like
the
peal
of
a
lark
at
the
gate
of
heaven
christian
christiansson
could
not
eat
he
could
only
rest
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
his
own
child
was
singing
his
own
song
to
him
in
a
voice
that
was
like
her
mother
s
voice
and
like
his
own
voice
too
when
the
song
was
done
she
turned
to
him
again
with
eyes
shining
with
unshed
tears
and
said
isn
t
that
beautiful
it
was
beautifully
sung
my
child
beautifully
he
said
and
then
after
a
moment
elin
would
you
like
to
hear
something
of
the
man
who
wrote
that
song
and
how
he
came
to
write
it
elin
s
eagerness
was
indeed
indeed
i
should
she
said
do
you
know
your
namesake
then
i
have
known
him
all
his
life
my
child
tell
me
about
him
oh
do
tell
me
one
who
has
such
beautiful
thoughts
and
feelings
must
be
so
good
and
noble
he
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
elin
but
only
a
poor
wayward
sinner
like
ourselves
in
early
life
he
did
wrong
by
his
young
wife
and
she
died
then
he
did
wrong
by
his
father
and
he
had
to
fly
from
his
country
after
that
he
went
through
many
sufferings
and
was
guilty
of
many
sins
but
he
came
to
himself
at
the
end
and
then
he
remembered
a
little
daughter
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
he
wished
to
return
to
her
immediately
and
be
a
father
to
her
at
last
and
make
it
up
to
her
for
all
that
he
had
done
amiss
to
her
mother
who
was
dead
but
there
were
many
things
to
do
first
for
he
was
like
one
who
was
buried
under
an
avalanche
which
he
had
brought
down
on
himself
and
he
had
to
work
his
way
back
to
life
and
the
world
so
when
he
was
far
away
and
his
heart
was
hungry
for
the
love
of
his
little
girl
and
he
didn
t
know
what
was
happening
to
her
and
he
wanted
so
much
oh
so
much
to
go
to
her
but
could
not
do
so
yet
because
he
had
sinned
and
must
pay
his
penalty
he
wrote
that
song
and
it
was
the
cry
of
his
soul
to
the
mother
in
heaven
to
comfort
and
care
for
their
child
on
earth
as
elin
listened
to
the
story
of
christian
christiansson
the
tears
which
had
been
standing
in
her
eyes
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
her
bosom
under
her
laced
bodice
slowly
rose
and
as
slowly
fell
again
how
beautiful
she
said
and
seeing
how
much
she
was
moved
by
the
sorrows
of
the
man
who
was
not
her
father
the
new
light
came
to
him
and
he
asked
himself
why
if
she
could
not
care
for
him
in
his
true
character
she
should
not
love
him
as
christian
christiansson
there
was
a
shadowy
ghost
of
pain
in
that
thought
too
but
he
put
it
aside
after
years
of
hope
and
heavy
labor
he
had
come
home
to
claim
his
child
and
what
he
had
dreaded
had
come
to
pass
her
heart
had
been
poisoned
against
him
but
while
she
loathed
him
as
oscar
stephenson
she
loved
him
as
christian
christiansson
oh
beautiful
blind
pathetic
fallacy
could
he
not
let
it
be
in
a
tumult
of
heart
and
brain
that
was
like
a
whirlpool
in
a
dark
river
he
had
risen
to
go
to
the
girl
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
to
do
or
say
when
anna
came
back
with
a
smoking
in
her
hand
saying
in
a
cheery
voice
here
it
is
at
last
the
fire
had
gone
out
in
the
and
i
had
work
enough
to
kindle
it
and
then
having
both
in
the
room
at
one
moment
his
mother
and
his
daughter
his
feelings
almost
mastered
him
again
and
he
had
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
blurting
out
everything
and
so
being
done
with
further
torture
but
just
as
the
words
of
his
confession
were
trembling
on
his
lips
he
thought
not
morning
and
then
what
joy
what
happiness
almost
at
the
same
moment
magnus
returned
to
the
house
and
said
the
little
mare
was
nearly
done
sir
but
i
ve
rubbed
her
down
and
given
her
hay
and
she
shall
have
a
mash
before
i
go
to
bed
let
us
have
a
bottle
of
brandy
first
said
christian
christiansson
and
a
few
minutes
later
elin
was
carrying
away
the
dishes
to
wash
them
anna
was
going
into
magnus
s
bedroom
to
make
it
ready
for
the
guest
and
the
two
brothers
were
sitting
at
opposite
sides
of
the
table
with
the
bottle
between
them
they
were
less
like
each
other
now
than
ever
before
the
elder
with
his
matted
black
beard
his
strong
features
and
the
vertical
lines
in
his
low
brow
under
the
upright
stubble
of
his
hair
the
younger
with
his
luminous
brown
eyes
and
delicate
face
his
full
round
forehead
and
his
thin
silken
light
hair
brushed
backward
to
the
crown
christian
christiansson
was
quivering
to
the
core
at
this
first
encounter
with
the
brother
whom
he
had
wronged
and
ruined
but
he
tried
to
bear
himself
bravely
and
to
see
how
safe
it
would
be
to
reveal
his
identity
when
the
time
came
to
do
so
it
s
good
of
you
to
give
up
your
room
to
me
he
began
that
s
nothing
nothing
at
all
said
magnus
and
perhaps
you
ought
to
know
why
i
m
here
please
yourself
sir
please
yourself
to
tell
you
the
truth
then
i
m
here
to
attend
the
auction
morning
i
only
heard
of
it
in
reykjavik
yesterday
having
arrived
by
the
laura
the
day
before
so
that
was
the
business
that
brought
you
sir
it
was
i
ve
been
abroad
for
fifteen
years
and
i
ve
made
some
money
and
now
i
ve
come
home
to
invest
it
so
knowing
this
was
a
good
farm
none
better
in
iceland
sir
if
it
only
had
a
chance
and
if
you
can
afford
to
buy
it
out
and
out
i
think
i
can
i
ve
money
enough
in
my
pocket
at
this
moment
to
buy
the
place
and
leave
some
for
something
else
i
m
sorry
for
you
though
and
if
it
s
painful
to
you
to
hear
me
talk
like
this
magnus
who
had
been
rolling
in
his
chair
like
a
man
whose
mind
as
well
as
his
body
was
uneasy
began
to
laugh
immoderately
not
at
all
sir
not
at
all
he
said
filling
his
glass
it
s
pleasant
to
hear
of
anybody
having
more
money
than
he
wants
for
my
part
i
ve
never
had
enough
to
pay
my
debts
sir
for
sixteen
years
i
ve
been
ploughing
the
waves
and
now
raising
his
glass
and
draining
it
i
m
reaping
the
breakers
b
them
christian
christiansson
trembled
to
his
very
heart
at
the
sound
of
magnus
s
laughter
the
bitter
laughter
of
rebellion
and
despair
but
he
tried
to
cover
up
his
fear
and
to
carry
it
off
with
a
cheery
tone
don
t
be
too
depressed
he
said
nobody
knows
what
the
future
has
in
store
for
him
it
s
a
pretty
dark
night
outside
but
all
the
same
the
sun
will
rise
morning
besides
there
s
always
a
sunny
side
to
misfortune
if
we
ll
only
allow
ourselves
to
see
it
life
is
sweet
my
friend
whatever
happens
you
think
it
is
sir
i
know
it
is
so
why
should
we
sit
down
on
our
little
handful
of
thorns
because
some
of
us
have
nothing
else
to
sit
upon
said
magnus
and
he
laughed
again
the
same
cold
quaking
laughter
christian
christiansson
shuddered
but
struggled
on
you
think
you
ve
failed
but
i
know
some
that
have
succeeded
who
would
be
glad
to
change
places
with
you
any
minute
they
ve
got
their
gold
or
their
fame
or
both
pouring
down
on
them
like
an
avalanche
and
nothing
to
do
with
it
nobody
to
share
it
with
so
it
is
only
so
much
dead
sea
fruit
being
piled
on
their
backs
you
are
not
like
that
even
if
you
have
to
lose
your
land
you
ve
got
your
health
and
a
good
character
and
a
clean
conscience
and
your
dear
ones
left
to
you
haven
t
you
that
s
why
said
magnus
you
don
t
suppose
i
m
thinking
of
myself
do
you
it
s
just
because
i
ve
got
my
dear
ones
left
to
me
that
this
accursed
is
so
hard
to
bear
what
s
it
to
me
to
have
my
houses
full
of
lambs
if
the
floods
have
come
and
they
are
floating
on
the
lake
you
talk
like
a
man
who
has
never
known
misfortune
sir
christian
christiansson
felt
dizzy
perhaps
i
haven
t
perhaps
i
have
he
said
in
a
faint
voice
but
i
ve
known
despair
and
i
know
that
no
man
can
live
by
that
we
can
only
live
by
hope
not
what
is
but
what
is
to
be
and
if
we
can
not
believe
when
the
clouds
are
dark
that
the
world
is
ruled
in
righteousness
and
is
it
said
magnus
does
the
bad
man
suffer
in
this
world
do
his
sheep
die
of
the
rot
and
his
cattle
tumble
over
the
rocks
or
do
they
increase
faster
than
anybody
else
s
no
sir
he
said
turning
away
in
his
seat
if
you
re
a
rascal
ready
to
rob
your
own
father
the
chances
are
you
ll
prosper
in
this
world
but
if
you
re
an
honest
man
trying
to
do
good
to
everybody
as
likely
as
not
you
ll
do
no
good
to
yourself
or
to
anybody
about
you
the
dizziness
which
had
seized
christian
christiansson
was
increasing
every
moment
but
he
said
the
world
has
its
own
way
of
punishing
offenders
and
even
if
they
escape
in
life
death
is
always
waiting
for
them
death
said
magnus
swinging
round
in
his
creaking
chair
death
is
a
blind
blundering
monster
who
strikes
down
the
young
and
leaves
the
old
the
happy
and
leaves
the
miserable
the
innocent
and
leaves
the
guilty
the
poor
helpless
betrayed
one
and
leaves
the
betrayer
we
have
all
seen
that
haven
t
we
have
i
know
that
much
the
heat
and
flame
of
magnus
s
husky
voice
had
fallen
to
a
thick
whisper
that
was
like
a
broken
sob
christian
christiansson
dared
not
raise
his
face
but
he
tried
to
say
god
brings
out
all
things
well
in
the
end
i
have
always
found
it
so
the
march
of
the
world
may
be
enveloped
in
darkness
but
it
tends
toward
justice
in
the
long
run
what
is
the
long
run
to
me
sir
said
magnus
i
m
only
here
for
a
few
years
and
i
want
justice
now
i
want
to
see
the
bad
man
punished
in
the
present
not
in
some
future
generation
justice
you
say
the
sins
of
the
fathers
visited
on
the
children
that
s
the
only
justice
i
see
in
this
world
a
poor
child
left
penniless
because
her
father
gambled
or
drank
the
money
he
didn
t
make
do
you
call
that
justice
sir
i
don
t
magnus
s
thick
voice
was
breaking
again
and
there
was
silence
for
a
little
while
no
no
sir
don
t
tell
me
we
get
our
deserts
in
this
world
any
of
us
good
or
bad
life
gives
the
lie
to
that
old
story
always
has
always
will
do
if
you
are
a
cheat
or
a
profligate
or
a
prodigal
you
may
live
in
luxury
and
travel
as
far
as
the
sun
but
if
you
are
a
poor
devil
staying
at
home
and
working
your
fingers
to
the
bone
you
ll
get
thrown
out
into
the
road
but
what
s
the
good
of
talking
the
evil
day
is
coming
let
it
come
never
before
had
christian
christiansson
felt
so
little
and
so
mean
the
sources
of
pride
were
dry
in
him
and
he
was
brought
very
low
in
his
own
esteem
in
the
presence
of
the
brother
who
had
borne
his
burdens
and
broken
down
under
them
he
saw
himself
as
an
abject
and
pitiful
thing
he
could
not
raise
his
head
for
he
felt
as
if
his
shame
were
written
on
his
forehead
but
he
struggled
to
say
something
and
the
only
words
that
came
to
him
seemed
to
scorch
his
tongue
and
parch
his
throat
i
can
not
dispute
with
you
he
said
you
ve
suffered
more
than
i
have
and
no
doubt
your
present
troubles
are
the
legacy
that
was
left
to
you
by
the
prodigal
brother
your
mother
was
talking
about
magnus
s
manner
changed
instantly
at
the
mention
of
his
mother
she
was
talking
about
him
again
was
she
he
said
does
she
often
talk
of
him
then
too
often
and
she
seems
to
think
of
nothing
else
he
was
the
foundation
she
built
her
house
upon
poor
soul
and
it
fell
but
she
holds
to
him
all
the
same
god
bless
her
said
christian
christiansson
involuntarily
god
bless
all
women
i
say
they
re
always
on
the
side
of
the
sinners
and
the
sufferers
they
ll
get
their
compensation
somewhere
they
must
he
was
thinking
of
morning
i
see
no
sign
of
it
in
this
case
said
magnus
she
was
the
best
mother
to
him
a
man
ever
had
and
he
knew
it
but
he
repaid
her
with
neglect
and
contempt
contempt
what
else
would
you
call
it
he
lived
five
years
abroad
and
wrote
to
her
only
once
in
all
that
time
yet
every
night
she
used
to
stand
outside
the
door
until
the
post
passed
winter
and
summer
dry
or
fine
waiting
for
the
letter
that
never
came
christian
christiansson
felt
as
if
his
very
soul
were
shriveling
up
with
shame
she
forgave
him
for
that
though
and
when
he
died
you
know
how
he
died
everybody
knows
it
she
thought
that
all
he
had
been
trying
to
do
when
he
fell
into
that
foul
dishonor
was
to
get
money
enough
to
come
back
home
and
make
amends
she
thought
that
did
she
she
still
thinks
it
christian
christiansson
had
a
sense
of
hysterical
oppression
at
his
heart
again
he
wanted
to
tell
all
and
he
dared
not
but
if
it
had
been
true
he
said
i
don
t
say
it
was
but
if
it
had
been
if
your
brother
had
really
been
trying
for
years
to
make
money
solely
in
order
to
wipe
out
the
debts
he
had
left
behind
him
if
he
had
come
home
with
the
fortune
in
his
hands
magnus
s
dark
face
darkened
ominously
and
bringing
his
great
fist
down
on
to
the
table
he
said
there
would
have
been
a
curse
on
every
coin
of
it
and
i
should
have
flung
it
in
his
face
christian
christiansson
did
not
ask
him
why
he
knew
too
well
what
magnus
meant
in
an
instant
by
such
a
flash
of
the
lightning
of
the
mind
as
must
come
to
the
guilty
soul
on
the
day
of
judgment
the
past
of
his
life
lay
open
before
him
and
the
most
awful
fact
of
it
stood
out
with
naked
vividness
the
desecration
of
his
wife
s
grave
it
was
impossible
to
plead
that
this
had
been
only
the
act
of
a
moment
that
he
had
repented
it
a
thousand
times
with
bitter
tears
that
he
had
derived
no
profit
or
advantage
from
it
and
had
endured
for
ten
years
its
fearful
penalty
in
the
death
of
his
identity
again
and
again
he
had
soothed
himself
with
such
excuses
but
he
could
not
cheat
his
conscience
now
why
was
he
christian
christiansson
how
had
it
come
to
pass
that
he
had
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
his
pocket
and
that
his
works
were
known
all
over
the
world
all
the
miserable
sophistry
and
false
reasoning
which
had
made
him
what
he
was
the
owner
of
fame
and
fortune
had
been
riddled
through
and
through
by
magnus
s
terrible
words
all
the
mocking
vanity
which
had
lured
him
onward
to
that
hour
with
promises
of
the
great
surprise
the
great
dénouement
when
he
should
say
see
i
am
here
i
have
justified
all
expectations
lay
stark
and
dead
and
cold
no
he
could
not
reveal
himself
to
his
family
morning
he
could
not
reveal
himself
at
all
having
once
become
christian
christiansson
he
could
never
again
be
known
as
oscar
stephenson
thus
did
the
dead
punish
him
and
the
desecration
of
his
wife
s
grave
had
but
rendered
the
vow
he
made
to
himself
perpetual
and
registered
the
oath
he
made
to
her
in
heaven
christian
christiansson
was
feeling
as
if
all
the
world
had
gone
away
from
him
when
anna
came
out
of
the
saying
there
sir
your
room
is
ready
and
you
can
go
to
bed
at
any
time
magnus
got
up
to
go
to
the
to
mix
the
mash
for
the
pony
and
then
mother
and
son
were
together
again
in
the
confusion
of
that
moment
he
was
asking
himself
how
he
could
carry
out
his
plan
of
rescuing
his
family
from
their
misfortunes
if
he
could
not
tell
them
who
he
was
and
how
he
could
claim
his
daughter
and
take
her
away
with
him
if
he
could
not
say
i
am
her
father
she
is
mine
when
chance
and
a
commonplace
word
those
twin
sisters
of
invention
and
wisdom
showed
him
what
he
was
to
do
i
shall
want
to
be
awakened
early
in
the
morning
landlady
for
i
suppose
the
sheriff
will
come
soon
the
sheriff
sir
i
ve
just
been
telling
your
son
that
i
intend
to
bid
for
your
farm
at
the
auction
morning
so
that
was
what
you
had
to
do
at
the
end
of
your
journey
yes
it
was
what
i
had
to
do
landlady
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
what
can
a
gentleman
like
you
want
with
a
farm
like
this
he
did
not
reply
so
she
said
you
can
not
think
of
living
in
such
a
lonesome
place
as
thingvellir
still
he
did
not
speak
and
she
said
again
you
might
let
the
farm
certainly
but
it
is
hungry
land
i
assure
you
and
everything
depends
on
how
you
work
it
she
busied
herself
about
the
table
as
if
trying
to
find
something
to
do
my
son
she
said
is
the
only
one
who
has
ever
been
able
to
work
it
properly
and
if
he
has
got
into
difficulties
at
last
it
wasn
t
his
fault
for
there
isn
t
a
man
in
iceland
who
would
have
been
able
to
keep
his
head
above
water
she
waited
for
him
to
say
something
but
he
gave
no
sign
his
difficulties
are
not
so
very
serious
either
eight
thousand
crowns
arrears
of
interest
that
is
all
in
sixteen
years
sir
again
she
waited
but
he
was
still
silent
when
the
sheriff
went
off
this
evening
he
said
if
my
son
could
find
the
money
before
nine
o
clock
morning
he
wouldn
t
go
on
with
the
auction
christian
christiansson
had
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
if
my
son
could
only
find
somebody
to
lend
him
the
money
there
was
a
ring
of
appeal
in
her
voice
which
startled
herself
for
she
stopped
and
looking
nervously
round
at
the
stranger
said
i
m
sure
he
would
never
regret
it
sir
magnus
would
work
his
fingers
to
the
bone
to
repay
every
penny
he
has
always
been
a
boy
like
that
and
with
better
seasons
and
a
little
luck
it
was
then
that
the
new
scheme
came
to
christian
christiansson
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
to
think
of
it
whereupon
anna
mistaking
the
meaning
of
the
altered
gesture
faltered
and
began
again
i
m
taking
a
great
liberty
sir
but
i
m
not
thinking
of
myself
i
m
thinking
of
my
son
in
one
sense
i
m
to
blame
for
all
that
has
happened
to
him
he
doesn
t
know
it
and
i
daren
t
tell
him
but
i
am
christian
christiansson
looked
up
at
her
it
was
all
my
fault
that
his
father
took
the
mortgage
fault
yes
sir
my
husband
loved
the
poor
boy
who
is
gone
but
he
was
the
governor
of
iceland
and
every
eye
was
on
him
to
see
that
he
kept
his
own
house
in
order
and
but
for
me
he
might
have
let
the
law
take
its
course
i
pleaded
and
prayed
with
him
thinking
that
we
ourselves
would
be
the
ones
to
suffer
but
i
only
ruined
one
son
in
trying
to
save
the
other
and
i
didn
t
save
him
christian
christiansson
dropped
his
head
for
the
waters
of
bitterness
were
falling
over
him
in
a
flood
and
anna
thinking
she
had
touched
him
went
on
more
eagerly
then
there
s
the
girl
sir
my
granddaughter
you
ve
seen
her
yourself
and
you
ll
say
she
doesn
t
look
like
a
servant
but
if
the
auction
comes
off
she
ll
have
to
go
out
to
service
they
treat
girls
shamefully
in
some
farmhouses
and
my
son
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
it
neither
can
i
for
i
can
t
help
thinking
of
her
father
whatever
else
he
may
have
been
he
was
a
gentleman
and
to
think
of
his
daughter
being
a
drudge
to
somebody
anna
s
voice
was
faltering
again
but
after
a
moment
she
went
on
bravely
as
for
myself
i
m
an
old
woman
and
a
little
misfortune
more
or
less
doesn
t
matter
to
me
now
my
time
is
short
in
any
case
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
when
i
m
called
most
of
my
loved
ones
are
gone
already
my
son
and
my
granddaughter
are
all
that
are
left
and
if
i
could
feel
that
i
was
leaving
them
happy
and
comfortable
christian
christiansson
could
bear
no
more
landlady
he
said
i
had
set
my
heart
on
buying
the
farm
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
buy
it
but
instead
of
doing
so
i
ll
lend
your
son
the
money
to
pay
the
interest
anna
s
eyes
opened
wide
in
astonishment
and
now
that
her
prayer
was
answered
her
breath
seemed
to
be
suspended
you
sir
she
said
i
will
on
one
condition
oh
never
mind
the
condition
let
me
go
and
tell
him
my
condition
is
that
you
give
me
the
girl
to
adopt
as
my
daughter
ah
i
m
a
lonely
person
too
though
i
m
not
so
old
as
you
are
and
when
i
m
in
england
i
haven
t
wife
or
child
or
mother
or
brother
to
share
my
life
with
me
the
girl
s
sweet
face
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
there
and
i
m
ready
to
pay
this
interest
if
you
are
willing
to
let
her
go
the
light
had
died
out
of
anna
s
eyes
her
head
was
down
i
should
give
you
every
guarantee
that
she
would
be
taken
care
of
i
am
rich
as
men
of
my
class
go
and
she
should
want
for
nothing
but
i
didn
t
think
your
condition
would
be
like
that
sir
said
anna
why
not
are
you
thinking
of
the
girl
or
of
yourself
landlady
i
am
thinking
of
my
son
no
man
was
ever
so
wrapped
up
in
a
child
he
has
had
her
nearly
all
her
life
and
he
is
very
very
fond
of
her
when
she
was
little
and
the
snow
was
deep
as
it
is
he
used
to
take
her
to
school
on
his
shoulder
and
at
night
when
she
was
sleepy
he
would
carry
her
in
his
arms
to
bed
if
she
were
his
own
he
could
not
love
her
more
dearly
it
is
like
fatherhood
to
him
and
he
will
never
be
a
father
now
because
anna
hesitated
as
if
trying
to
say
something
which
she
was
afraid
to
say
and
then
through
her
gathering
tears
she
blurted
out
her
secret
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
he
cared
for
her
mother
but
gave
her
up
to
somebody
else
and
she
died
and
from
that
day
forward
all
the
best
years
of
his
life
were
wasted
in
a
cruel
longing
for
something
to
love
then
the
child
came
and
it
was
almost
as
if
the
mother
herself
had
sent
her
little
one
to
comfort
him
could
not
love
him
for
she
loved
the
other
one
to
the
last
but
the
child
might
and
she
has
god
bless
her
she
has
christian
christiansson
was
wrung
to
the
heart
but
he
struggled
on
so
you
think
he
could
not
part
with
the
girl
even
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
i
don
t
say
that
sir
and
perhaps
if
it
were
put
to
him
properly
put
it
yourself
landlady
i
daren
t
he
might
suppose
that
i
was
thinking
of
myself
and
if
he
did
would
that
be
such
a
serious
matter
can
it
be
nothing
to
him
that
his
mother
will
be
saved
from
being
homeless
if
no
harm
is
to
come
to
the
girl
and
no
harm
shall
come
to
her
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
anna
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
she
said
you
would
tell
us
where
she
is
to
go
and
what
she
is
to
do
and
how
she
is
to
be
brought
up
indeed
i
would
she
might
write
to
us
constantly
and
come
to
see
us
sometimes
perhaps
certainly
she
might
after
all
it
would
just
be
like
going
into
service
just
only
she
would
be
a
lady
not
a
servant
only
that
you
would
be
good
to
her
something
tells
me
you
would
and
you
would
wouldn
t
you
i
should
be
as
good
to
the
girl
as
if
as
if
i
were
her
own
father
said
christian
christiansson
anna
dried
her
eyes
and
said
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
sir
i
really
don
t
know
what
to
say
to
you
say
nothing
to
me
speak
to
your
son
landlady
you
will
lend
him
the
money
to
pay
the
interest
immediately
immediately
eight
thousand
crowns
you
can
find
it
all
by
nine
o
clock
morning
see
said
christian
christiansson
taking
the
pocketbook
out
of
his
there
s
enough
in
this
purse
to
pay
the
interest
twenty
times
over
and
i
ll
not
the
money
to
your
son
i
ll
it
to
him
if
he
will
give
me
the
girl
instead
he
will
be
sorry
to
part
with
her
but
after
all
it
will
be
one
mouth
less
to
feed
and
when
i
m
gone
that
will
be
another
and
then
perhaps
having
no
burdens
and
no
embarrassments
speak
to
him
he
s
here
said
christian
christiansson
and
just
at
that
moment
magnus
returned
to
the
hall
carrying
a
wooden
bowl
of
smoking
bran
then
in
a
low
and
trembling
tone
hardly
daring
to
raise
her
eyes
to
his
face
anna
told
her
son
of
the
stranger
s
offer
dwelling
chiefly
on
the
advantages
to
himself
when
elin
would
be
provided
for
and
she
herself
would
be
under
the
earth
and
he
no
longer
crippled
by
grinding
debt
would
be
able
to
pay
his
way
and
win
back
his
lost
inheritance
but
as
she
went
on
her
voice
faltered
and
her
words
became
confused
for
he
was
looking
down
at
her
with
a
lowering
brow
and
at
last
she
stopped
altogether
saying
i
didn
t
mean
any
harm
magnus
i
only
thought
you
thought
i
could
sacrifice
elin
to
save
myself
mother
said
magnus
and
at
that
hard
word
anna
sank
into
a
chair
and
sobbed
then
magnus
turned
to
christian
christiansson
and
said
i
m
much
obliged
for
your
offer
sir
but
my
niece
is
not
for
sale
with
that
he
was
passing
out
of
the
house
when
christian
christiansson
who
was
quivering
from
head
to
foot
cried
wait
well
you
have
decided
for
yourself
fast
enough
have
you
thought
of
anybody
else
who
else
is
there
to
think
about
your
mother
for
one
if
you
refuse
my
offer
and
the
house
is
sold
over
your
heads
morning
what
is
to
become
of
her
magnus
flushed
as
if
an
invisible
hand
had
smitten
him
across
the
face
what
is
to
become
of
the
girl
too
have
you
thought
of
that
have
you
a
right
to
send
her
into
service
to
be
a
drudge
to
somebody
magnus
was
shuddering
visibly
even
the
bowl
was
trembling
in
his
hands
no
doubt
you
are
fond
of
the
girl
and
have
been
good
to
her
but
if
she
were
your
own
daughter
she
would
be
a
separate
being
and
in
a
case
like
this
you
would
have
no
right
to
speak
for
her
then
she
shall
speak
for
herself
said
magnus
and
putting
the
smoking
bowl
on
the
table
he
crossed
to
the
inner
door
and
cried
in
an
agitated
voice
elin
elin
elin
in
a
moment
the
girl
came
running
into
the
room
with
a
look
of
alarm
saying
what
is
it
has
anything
happened
listen
said
magnus
and
christian
christiansson
could
see
that
though
his
voice
shook
as
if
his
soul
were
shaken
he
was
trying
to
speak
calmly
this
gentleman
he
said
has
told
your
grandmother
that
he
wishes
to
adopt
you
as
a
daughter
and
he
offers
to
pay
my
debts
if
i
am
willing
to
let
you
go
uncle
cried
the
girl
i
have
told
him
you
shall
speak
for
yourself
and
so
you
shall
and
whatever
you
decide
to
do
your
grandmother
and
i
will
agree
to
but
uncle
don
t
speak
yet
my
child
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
hear
everything
elin
i
am
a
broken
man
and
i
have
no
longer
a
home
to
offer
you
after
the
auction
morning
i
don
t
know
what
is
to
become
of
grandmother
and
you
and
me
or
where
we
are
to
go
or
what
roof
is
to
cover
us
but
this
gentleman
is
rich
and
he
promises
to
provide
for
you
all
your
life
and
to
give
you
all
you
need
and
everything
you
could
wish
for
if
you
stay
with
me
you
may
suffer
privations
but
if
you
go
to
him
you
will
never
know
a
poor
day
again
as
long
as
you
live
his
deep
voice
had
all
it
could
do
to
support
itself
but
he
bore
up
to
the
end
and
then
anna
whose
eyes
were
filling
as
fast
as
she
could
wipe
them
said
isn
t
it
wonderful
elin
isn
t
it
like
a
miracle
like
an
answer
to
your
prayer
my
child
just
when
we
were
so
low
and
downhearted
the
gentleman
will
satisfy
us
that
you
are
going
to
a
good
christian
home
and
that
you
will
be
properly
brought
up
and
cared
for
and
then
christian
christiansson
himself
though
he
could
scarcely
speak
for
the
contending
emotions
that
shook
him
to
the
soul
stepped
forward
and
said
let
me
tell
you
who
i
am
elin
we
spoke
of
christian
christiansson
the
composer
and
you
sang
his
song
to
me
and
said
you
would
like
to
hear
something
about
him
i
am
christian
christiansson
the
girl
made
a
little
involuntary
cry
and
his
voice
faltered
for
a
moment
yes
i
am
he
and
the
story
i
told
you
was
the
story
of
my
own
unhappy
life
only
i
have
lost
my
daughter
since
i
wrote
that
song
and
now
i
am
quite
alone
will
you
not
come
and
take
her
place
my
child
you
shall
be
just
the
same
to
me
as
my
own
daughter
and
you
shall
never
know
the
difference
you
will
return
with
me
to
england
and
live
my
life
and
whatever
i
do
you
shall
do
and
wherever
i
go
you
shall
go
also
think
of
that
elin
said
anna
you
love
music
you
take
after
your
poor
father
that
way
and
you
will
travel
about
just
as
your
dear
mother
used
to
do
it
would
be
beautiful
said
elin
she
had
been
standing
all
this
time
by
the
table
with
one
hand
resting
lightly
upon
it
while
her
sweet
face
reflected
the
changing
lights
of
alarm
and
pain
and
surprise
and
joy
i
can
t
think
of
anything
in
the
world
i
should
love
so
much
but
i
can
not
i
must
not
elin
grandma
didn
t
you
tell
me
yourself
when
i
came
here
long
ago
and
you
put
me
to
bed
the
first
time
that
i
was
never
to
leave
uncle
magnus
and
if
anybody
ever
came
to
take
me
away
i
was
not
to
go
i
was
a
little
mite
but
i
gave
you
my
word
i
remember
and
i
am
going
to
keep
it
but
i
was
thinking
of
somebody
else
then
elin
i
couldn
t
know
that
this
gentleman
would
come
at
a
time
like
this
too
but
that
makes
no
difference
grandma
besides
if
i
were
to
go
to
this
gentleman
and
he
were
to
treat
me
as
if
i
were
his
own
daughter
i
should
have
to
think
of
him
as
if
he
were
my
own
father
would
you
like
that
grandma
and
would
uncle
magnus
like
it
we
should
sacrifice
ourselves
honey
we
should
sacrifice
ourselves
that
you
might
be
well
off
and
happy
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
well
off
if
you
and
uncle
magnus
are
going
to
be
poor
and
i
shouldn
t
be
happy
at
all
i
should
be
miserable
oh
dear
oh
dear
moaned
anna
unable
to
say
more
and
then
the
girl
turned
with
a
smile
to
christian
christiansson
who
was
throbbing
with
pride
and
pain
and
she
said
it
is
very
very
good
of
you
sir
and
there
isn
t
another
girl
in
the
world
who
wouldn
t
be
glad
to
go
but
i
can
t
you
must
see
yourself
i
can
t
i
must
stay
with
my
uncle
grandma
is
going
to
do
so
and
why
shouldn
t
i
he
would
be
better
without
either
of
us
elin
said
anna
don
t
say
that
grandma
i
do
say
it
my
child
and
if
you
only
knew
how
cruel
the
world
is
but
god
isn
t
and
he
will
not
separate
us
now
after
we
have
been
together
so
long
you
said
so
yourself
you
know
when
i
talked
of
going
into
service
you
said
he
would
find
another
way
and
he
will
i
m
sure
he
will
it
wrung
anna
s
heart
to
have
her
own
teaching
coming
back
to
reproach
her
yet
thinking
of
magnus
she
made
one
more
effort
but
don
t
you
see
dear
that
if
you
stay
with
uncle
magnus
he
will
lose
the
land
whereas
if
you
go
with
this
gentleman
he
will
be
able
to
keep
it
then
the
innocent
young
face
which
had
been
so
full
of
beautiful
trust
in
the
greatness
and
the
goodness
of
god
to
triumph
over
all
perils
and
privations
clouded
over
for
one
moment
and
she
said
do
you
me
to
go
grandma
and
does
uncle
magnus
want
it
neither
of
them
answered
her
and
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
anna
brushing
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
wrinkled
hand
and
magnus
standing
motionless
with
a
white
face
broken
up
like
the
melting
snow
and
then
the
cruel
swelling
in
the
girl
s
heart
subsided
and
her
eyes
shone
like
the
sun
i
you
don
t
she
answered
herself
you
are
only
thinking
about
and
then
the
brave
little
soul
tossed
up
her
head
with
a
proud
look
and
said
as
for
the
land
if
it
comes
to
losing
that
or
losing
me
i
know
what
uncle
magnus
will
say
he
will
say
i
he
will
let
me
keep
my
little
elin
and
the
land
land
may
and
so
i
do
my
darling
cried
magnus
and
he
opened
his
great
arms
to
her
and
she
ran
into
them
and
was
gathered
to
his
breast
at
the
next
moment
anna
had
joined
them
and
magnus
had
put
his
arms
around
both
and
it
was
just
as
if
they
had
conquered
a
great
temptation
as
if
some
dark
shadow
which
had
threatened
to
separate
them
had
passed
away
for
they
were
clinging
together
and
crying
like
children
christian
christiansson
stood
aside
for
a
moment
and
looked
on
at
their
happiness
feeling
himself
without
part
or
lot
in
it
and
then
fearing
that
he
might
cry
out
and
betray
himself
or
break
down
altogether
he
turned
away
and
fled
into
the
he
threw
himself
face
downward
on
the
bed
and
the
waters
of
marah
went
over
and
over
him
sight
of
the
happiness
he
had
lost
the
right
to
claim
was
the
hardest
experience
that
had
yet
come
to
him
and
he
wept
bitterly
my
child
my
dear
dear
child
he
had
wanted
to
cry
but
those
were
words
of
proud
endearment
which
he
might
never
use
except
in
the
voiceless
chambers
of
his
empty
heart
but
this
mood
lasted
only
for
a
few
moments
and
then
a
fierce
and
almost
savage
jealousy
took
possession
of
him
and
he
dried
his
eyes
and
sat
up
in
contempt
of
his
own
weakness
what
right
had
any
one
to
rob
him
of
his
child
elin
was
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
no
man
should
take
her
away
even
the
law
would
recognize
his
right
to
his
own
offspring
he
had
merely
to
say
to
the
sheriff
she
is
mine
and
the
sheriff
would
have
no
choice
but
to
deliver
her
up
to
him
then
calmer
moments
came
and
he
saw
that
he
could
only
assert
his
legal
right
to
his
daughter
by
disclosing
his
identity
and
that
was
out
of
the
question
and
even
if
it
were
possible
to
carry
his
daughter
away
by
force
it
would
be
a
poor
triumph
to
take
her
body
if
he
could
not
also
take
her
soul
every
man
wished
his
children
to
love
him
and
unless
elin
could
love
her
father
what
was
the
good
of
claiming
her
he
opened
his
eyes
to
calm
the
deafening
tumult
of
his
conflicting
thoughts
and
saw
a
little
faded
photograph
in
a
stand
on
a
table
that
stood
beside
the
bed
it
was
an
old
photograph
of
thora
and
he
remembered
it
immediately
for
it
was
the
same
that
in
the
better
time
belonged
to
aunt
margret
and
stood
on
the
drawers
beside
her
door
he
took
it
up
in
his
shaking
hand
and
held
the
candle
to
look
at
it
and
then
in
a
moment
by
that
magic
the
almighty
knows
he
was
back
with
thora
in
the
at
government
house
and
she
was
saying
in
the
tremulous
joy
of
her
young
motherhood
kiss
me
oscar
put
your
arms
about
both
of
us
dearest
that
way
so
something
of
the
tenderness
of
thora
s
sweet
heart
returned
to
him
with
that
haunting
memory
and
along
with
it
came
a
new
and
thrilling
thought
if
elin
belonged
to
him
by
right
of
nature
then
nature
herself
would
speak
for
him
he
had
only
to
say
to
her
i
am
your
father
you
are
my
daughter
and
she
would
come
to
him
she
could
not
help
herself
because
nature
is
a
mighty
thing
and
none
of
us
can
resist
the
mysterious
call
that
comes
to
our
blood
from
the
blood
that
gave
us
birth
he
would
do
so
he
would
find
the
girl
alone
and
speak
to
her
he
would
whisper
the
secret
of
his
life
in
the
ear
of
his
own
child
and
then
the
marvelous
mother
of
us
all
would
do
the
rest
when
he
returned
to
the
hall
elin
was
shaking
out
the
cloth
and
removing
the
last
of
the
supper
things
all
except
the
bottle
and
glasses
which
she
left
on
the
table
it
must
be
now
he
thought
and
though
his
heart
quailed
at
coming
to
this
last
throw
in
the
game
he
had
played
for
life
and
love
he
put
his
fortune
to
the
test
it
was
very
brave
of
you
my
child
he
said
to
choose
poverty
when
you
might
have
chosen
wealth
but
you
did
well
for
wealth
is
only
of
this
world
s
making
and
the
angel
that
brings
us
happiness
does
not
ask
us
if
we
are
poor
or
rich
his
voice
faltered
when
he
came
to
what
he
had
to
say
next
but
he
rallied
and
went
on
it
was
very
sweet
of
you
too
to
remain
with
your
uncle
and
your
grandmother
instead
of
coming
to
a
stranger
for
being
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
they
have
naturally
the
first
claim
upon
you
but
if
if
instead
of
christian
christiansson
i
had
been
own
would
you
would
you
have
come
to
me
then
elin
did
not
answer
him
immediately
and
he
looked
steadfastly
into
her
face
feeling
that
all
hope
of
happiness
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
hung
on
her
reply
would
you
the
sweet
young
face
looked
troubled
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
very
slowly
and
sadly
elin
shook
her
head
he
felt
like
a
man
who
had
been
sentenced
to
death
but
while
his
face
clouded
and
fell
the
girl
s
rose
and
became
beautifully
calm
i
don
t
see
how
that
could
make
any
difference
she
said
i
couldn
t
feel
as
if
you
were
my
father
unless
i
had
known
you
as
long
as
i
could
remember
and
longer
even
than
that
what
i
call
a
father
is
one
who
has
nursed
you
on
his
knee
when
you
were
a
little
thing
and
kissed
you
and
coaxed
you
when
you
were
sick
and
thought
of
you
and
cared
for
you
always
not
one
who
has
been
away
from
you
all
your
life
who
has
never
cared
for
you
at
all
and
whom
you
wouldn
t
know
if
you
met
him
in
the
road
but
don
t
you
feel
dear
that
there
is
something
in
the
relation
of
a
child
to
her
father
however
he
may
have
neglected
her
something
intimate
and
sacred
something
she
can
never
know
in
her
relation
to
anybody
else
however
much
he
may
have
done
for
her
don
t
you
feel
that
elin
again
the
girl
thought
for
a
moment
and
again
she
shook
her
head
but
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
my
child
my
dear
dear
child
i
may
have
done
nothing
for
you
but
still
i
am
your
father
and
you
are
the
only
one
who
is
left
to
me
now
and
i
want
you
to
come
to
me
and
be
my
daughter
and
we
shall
never
be
parted
again
if
i
were
to
say
that
to
you
would
you
still
hold
to
your
uncle
the
tremulous
fervor
with
which
he
spoke
these
imploring
words
brought
tears
to
the
girl
s
eyes
but
her
heart
stood
firm
and
strong
yes
she
said
i
couldn
t
help
it
because
uncle
magnus
has
been
my
real
father
after
all
it
was
all
over
his
last
hold
of
the
girl
was
lost
again
he
felt
as
if
the
world
had
gone
away
from
him
as
if
the
dark
column
of
hope
which
had
shown
its
bright
face
for
a
moment
had
turned
again
and
now
all
was
hopeless
darkness
he
had
thought
nature
would
speak
to
the
girl
but
it
had
not
spoken
nature
was
a
great
inexorable
instrument
in
the
hand
of
god
and
god
s
hand
was
on
him
he
had
done
so
he
was
being
done
as
he
had
taken
the
love
of
thora
from
magnus
so
magnus
after
many
years
had
taken
the
love
of
elin
from
him
it
was
right
it
was
inevitable
and
he
must
bow
his
head
in
speechless
submission
before
the
justice
and
the
vengeance
of
god
he
must
leave
the
house
as
he
had
come
to
it
not
only
without
revealing
himself
to
his
mother
and
brother
but
also
without
his
child
it
would
be
the
bitterest
moment
of
his
life
but
he
must
meet
it
and
go
on
you
are
quite
right
my
dear
quite
right
he
said
a
child
s
love
is
like
a
flower
in
the
window
it
can
not
grow
without
somebody
to
water
it
your
uncle
has
done
everything
for
you
and
he
is
entitled
to
all
your
affection
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
if
your
father
could
come
back
after
all
these
years
and
take
you
away
from
him
cling
to
him
elin
love
him
and
comfort
him
and
may
god
bless
you
for
your
loyalty
and
trust
he
had
tried
to
speak
bravely
but
his
voice
broke
and
he
stopped
after
a
moment
he
said
calmly
can
you
give
me
pen
and
ink
and
a
sheet
of
she
brought
them
instantly
and
he
sat
at
the
table
and
wrote
a
line
or
two
then
he
took
out
his
opened
it
and
put
the
paper
inside
of
it
and
closed
it
up
again
elin
will
you
do
me
a
great
favor
oh
yes
sir
said
the
girl
it
is
late
and
i
ve
had
a
long
day
and
i
may
not
be
up
when
the
auction
begins
in
the
morning
will
you
take
this
and
give
it
to
the
sheriff
the
moment
he
arrives
with
pleasure
sir
you
will
not
open
it
or
show
it
to
anybody
else
but
you
will
carry
it
to
your
room
at
once
and
put
it
under
your
pillow
and
morning
you
will
be
up
early
and
give
it
to
the
sheriff
before
he
begins
the
sale

you
do
this
for
me
my
dear
indeed
i
will
sir
thank
you
and
now
you
must
go
to
bed
my
child
but
i
ll
see
you
in
the
morning
sir
who
can
say
we
may
both
have
other
things
to
think
about
by
that
time
so
we
had
better
say
to
each
other
now
but
am
i
not
to
see
you
again
who
can
say
that
either
i
have
come
a
long
way
you
know
and
now
i
may
have
to
go
he
hesitated
and
then
turning
away
he
said
i
may
have
to
go
still
farther
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
sir
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
go
with
you
ah
god
forbid
i
mean
you
can
not
i
see
you
can
not
but
if
you
have
done
so
i
should
have
been
so
fond
of
you
and
we
should
have
been
such
good
friends
together
i
shall
never
forget
you
sir
nor
i
you
i
shall
always
think
of
the
brave
little
girl
i
met
once
only
once
and
then
could
see
no
more
you
are
only
a
stranger
to
me
sir
but
but
yes
i
am
only
a
stranger
to
you
my
child
but
we
have
come
together
on
the
great
ocean
of
life
and
now
now
we
must
say
and
part
sir
little
girl
and
god
bless
you
the
girl
stepped
to
her
bedroom
door
and
then
stopped
and
turned
and
looked
back
at
him
her
eyes
were
full
she
knew
not
why
nature
was
saying
something
to
her
at
last
she
knew
not
what
he
was
looking
after
her
with
all
his
hungry
soul
in
his
quivering
face
and
when
she
turned
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
elin
he
whispered
and
she
came
back
to
him
and
he
folded
her
to
his
heart
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
on
the
lips
ah
sweet
soft
warm
lips
he
felt
them
to
the
last
a
mist
floated
before
his
eyes
he
heard
footsteps
going
away
from
him
he
heard
a
door
open
and
close
and
then
his
child
was
gone
christian
christiansson
was
alone
he
felt
that
he
had
come
to
the
lees
of
his
life
and
saw
nothing
but
a
blank
where
he
might
crawl
to
die
could
he
go
back
to
reykjavik
that
was
impossible
for
the
minister
and
his
people
would
be
preparing
their
banquet
in
honor
of
his
visit
and
to
go
through
such
rejoicing
would
be
a
scorching
martyrdom
at
which
the
devil
himself
would
laugh
could
he
return
to
england
and
resume
his
old
life
as
the
unknown
composer
that
was
impossible
also
for
he
could
never
write
as
he
had
written
before
because
the
old
impulse
was
gone
the
fire
was
burnt
out
the
life
that
had
inspired
him
was
dead
and
because
the
foundations
of
his
fame
were
broken
up
by
the
new
consciousness
that
he
had
no
right
to
it
by
the
sense
that
his
career
and
all
that
had
come
of
it
had
been
built
on
the
desecration
of
his
wife
s
grave
and
by
the
certainty
that
his
success
had
been
paid
for
as
by
the
sweat
of
his
very
soul
what
then
was
before
him
old
age
what
was
old
age
without
friends
without
children
without
love
without
respect
and
with
memory
that
last
joy
of
a
man
s
declining
days
like
a
poisoned
river
running
through
a
wasted
land
was
there
nothing
before
him
then
yes
there
was
one
thing
one
only
and
as
he
lay
in
that
room
alone
with
his
head
over
his
hands
on
the
table
he
had
the
trembling
thrilling
palpitating
sense
of
supernatural
wings
hovering
above
him
and
of
an
awful
voice
that
seemed
to
say
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
at
that
moment
he
became
aware
of
other
voices
more
human
and
homely
voices
murmuring
about
him
and
one
of
them
said
he
has
fallen
asleep
poor
gentleman
and
another
he
has
drunk
too
much
perhaps
then
a
hand
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
somebody
cried
in
his
ear
hadn
t
you
better
go
to
bed
sir
it
was
his
mother
with
magnus
behind
her
and
looking
at
both
he
could
see
that
they
supposed
he
was
intoxicated
in
the
wild
laboring
of
heart
and
brain
it
suited
him
that
they
should
continue
to
think
so
and
indeed
the
strain
of
nerve
had
been
so
hard
that
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
staggered
like
a
drunken
man
heigho
what
s
this
he
laughed
your
must
be
pretty
heady
landlady
but
no
matter
it
will
be
a
good
nightcap
and
make
me
sleep
the
sounder
i
m
tired
very
tired
but
i
m
going
to
have
a
long
sleep
at
last
a
long
long
sleep
at
last
but
will
be
new
year
s
day
said
anna
the
bells
ring
at
daybreak
and
the
sheriff
will
be
here
soon
after
so
you
ll
have
to
be
stirring
early
if
you
want
to
be
ready
for
the
auction
why
so
i
shall
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
since
we
can
not
agree
about
the
girl
i
must
buy
the
farm
whatever
happens
i
told
you
i
wanted
it
for
a
particular
purpose
but
i
didn
t
say
what
it
was
it
s
my
secret
landlady
but
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
i
want
it
for
my
mother
your
mother
that
s
so
she
was
born
in
these
parts
and
the
poor
old
thing
would
like
to
end
her
days
here
so
she
tells
you
to
buy
up
my
farmstead
not
she
she
doesn
t
know
anything
about
it
that
s
to
be
my
surprise
i
ve
not
been
a
good
son
but
when
i
go
away
never
to
come
back
again
i
want
to
feel
that
the
dear
old
soul
is
happy
and
comfortable
and
has
a
roof
to
cover
her
he
laughed
with
the
same
sense
as
before
of
an
hysterical
oppression
of
the
heart
and
then
turned
to
magnus
and
said
sorry
to
buy
your
house
over
your
head
but
business
is
business
you
know
and
anybody
is
at
liberty
to
bid
who
has
money
to
pay
magnus
moved
aside
with
a
contemptuous
expression
don
t
look
so
glum
my
man
you
think
you
ve
been
badly
treated
and
perhaps
you
have
but
you
re
the
luckiest
man
in
iceland
if
you
ask
me
you
think
because
you
ve
done
well
you
ought
to
be
rewarded
but
what
right
have
poor
wretches
like
us
to
expect
reward
in
this
world
you
think
because
a
man
is
rich
he
is
to
be
envied
but
what
s
the
use
of
having
your
pocket
full
if
your
heart
is
empty
and
you
think
because
death
kills
the
innocent
and
the
happy
it
is
a
cruel
monster
but
there
are
worse
things
than
death
and
life
is
one
of
them
when
you
ve
nobody
to
care
whether
you
live
or
die
then
cheer
up
old
fellow
you
ve
got
your
health
and
your
good
name
and
your
mother
and
that
sweet
girl
to
love
and
to
love
you
so
what
the
devil
have
you
got
to
complain
of
nothing
at
all
saying
this
with
a
mixture
of
real
emotion
and
its
mocking
a
touch
of
the
boy
came
back
to
him
for
a
moment
and
he
put
his
arm
across
his
brother
s
shoulder
as
he
used
to
do
in
the
old
days
but
magnus
shuddered
and
shrank
away
your
candle
is
burning
in
the
bedroom
sir
said
anna
coldly
and
then
he
saw
that
his
mother
also
looked
black
at
him
as
one
who
had
come
to
turn
them
out
of
house
and
home
and
as
one
who
had
tried
to
tempt
the
girl
away
from
them
and
as
one
who
could
laugh
at
their
condition
and
have
no
thought
except
for
himself
and
thinking
that
this
was
the
last
he
would
see
of
her
that
it
was
so
different
from
the
parting
he
had
expected
that
all
hope
of
pardon
and
reconciliation
was
lost
that
his
mother
would
never
hear
that
her
lingering
faith
in
her
prodigal
had
been
justified
and
never
know
that
he
had
been
and
gone
he
had
as
much
as
he
could
do
not
to
break
down
and
betray
himself
even
at
the
end
but
gathering
up
his
clothes
which
had
been
drying
by
the
stove
he
turned
toward
the
bedroom
saying
with
another
laugh
a
laugh
that
went
to
anna
s
heart
like
a
sword
don
t
look
so
downhearted
landlady
when
things
are
at
their
worst
they
can
t
move
without
they
mend
you
ve
had
your
troubles
but
you
shall
drink
my
health
under
my
mother
s
morning
good
night
and
then
he
reeled
into
the
the
stranger
being
gone
mother
and
son
looked
into
each
other
s
faces
then
they
spoken
in
whispers
did
you
hear
him
said
anna
about
his
mother
s
asked
magnus
about
the
auction
about
everything
the
man
can
have
no
feeling
no
pity
none
business
is
business
he
said
when
he
talked
of
buying
the
place
over
our
heads
and
when
he
spoke
of
his
mother
ending
her
days
here
he
never
once
thought
of
me
he
never
thought
of
elin
either
he
would
have
taken
the
girl
away
from
us
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
would
said
anna
there
s
enough
in
this
purse
he
said
to
pay
your
interest
twenty
times
did
he
say
that
he
did
he
took
his
out
of
his
and
his
you
say
yes
and
i
ll
the
money
to
your
son
he
said
if
he
ll
give
me
the
girl
anna
talked
on
in
an
innocent
helpless
way
without
knowing
what
bad
work
she
was
doing
but
suddenly
mysteriously
at
the
mention
of
the
purse
a
change
passed
over
magnus
s
face
and
it
grew
ugly
with
evil
passions
he
must
be
rich
said
anna
richer
than
anybody
has
a
right
to
be
said
magnus
surely
god
can
not
mean
that
anybody
should
be
as
rich
as
that
while
other
people
are
so
poor
god
said
magnus
and
his
distorted
face
quivered
if
he
would
only
lend
us
enough
to
satisfy
the
sheriff
in
the
morning
said
anna
what
s
the
good
of
expecting
a
man
to
help
us
to
keep
the
farm
when
he
has
come
to
buy
it
for
himself
it
s
hard
though
cruelly
hard
to
be
turned
out
of
house
and
home
by
the
first
person
who
comes
along
with
more
money
that
s
what
i
was
thinking
said
magnus
down
to
this
moment
anna
had
only
been
trying
to
sympathize
with
magnus
s
mood
but
now
something
in
his
tone
made
her
suspect
that
she
had
awakened
a
devil
and
she
looked
at
him
in
terror
he
took
up
the
bottle
and
drank
he
drank
out
of
the
neck
and
there
was
a
new
devil
in
every
drop
his
eyes
began
to
gleam
with
a
feverish
luster
and
anna
trembled
she
remembered
that
magnus
had
not
taken
any
strong
drink
until
since
the
day
of
thora
s
funeral
and
then
she
thought
of
her
father
and
a
sensation
of
extreme
cold
crept
over
her
let
us
not
talk
of
it
any
more
she
said
as
she
tried
to
put
the
bottle
away
but
magnus
held
on
to
it
mother
and
son
looked
at
each
other
again
and
then
anna
went
over
to
the
stranger
s
door
and
listened
has
he
locked
it
asked
magnus
no
i
m
afraid
no
no
he
has
not
what
is
he
doing
the
candle
is
out
he
must
be
in
bed
already
then
said
magnus
he
has
thrown
himself
down
without
undressing
and
the
is
on
him
still
magnus
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
anna
her
teeth
were
chattering
would
it
be
so
very
wicked
what
to
take
as
much
as
would
satisfy
the
sheriff
in
the
morning
magnus
i
didn
t
mean
that
he
would
never
miss
it
never
know
it
was
gone
and
it
would
enable
us
to
keep
the
farm
and
so
save
us
from
starvation
oh
dear
what
have
i
done
he
s
a
prodigal
himself
it
seems
very
well
let
prodigal
pay
for
prodigal
she
could
not
breathe
freely
she
could
only
look
at
magnus
in
speechless
surprise
he
took
up
the
bottle
again
and
gulped
clown
the
last
of
the
liquor
he
has
drunk
a
good
deal
he
will
sleep
heavily
and
he
won
t
awake
until
the
auction
is
over
let
us
go
to
bed
said
anna
go
yourself
he
growled
for
the
furies
that
march
in
the
brain
of
the
drunken
man
had
mastered
him
magnus
said
anna
if
you
will
not
go
to
bed
i
shall
stay
up
all
night
with
you
then
the
devil
that
had
changed
magnus
into
a
cunning
savage
beast
showed
him
what
he
had
to
do
very
well
let
us
go
to
bed
he
replied
he
bolted
the
outer
door
again
and
raked
out
the
stove
while
his
mother
extinguished
the
lamp
and
the
candles
she
thought
the
evil
impulse
that
had
come
to
him
had
been
conquered
and
she
talked
of
other
matters
i
ve
made
up
eric
s
bed
for
you
and
you
ll
find
everything
comfortable
she
said
as
she
passed
elin
s
door
she
opened
it
gently
and
held
her
head
aside
to
listen
the
sound
of
the
soft
and
measured
breathing
came
out
to
them
for
a
moment
and
then
the
door
was
closed
again
poor
child
she
would
lay
her
head
on
her
pillow
full
of
faith
in
the
miracle
that
is
to
happen
before
morning
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
they
parted
at
the
door
of
the
badstofa
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
little
house
lay
silent
and
dark
in
the
arms
of
the
hills
and
on
the
breast
of
the
snow
but
the
wings
of
death
hung
over
it
magnus
did
not
go
to
bed
he
threw
himself
on
the
eiderdown
and
went
through
a
fierce
fight
with
god
as
represented
by
god
s
vicar
his
conscience
a
vision
of
the
in
the
stranger
s
danced
before
his
dark
heart
and
he
told
himself
that
come
what
would
he
must
take
enough
of
the
stranger
s
money
to
pay
the
interest
in
the
morning
if
he
did
not
do
so
the
man
would
buy
the
farmstead
and
elin
and
his
mother
would
be
turned
adrift
on
this
thought
came
compunctions
to
take
the
man
s
money
would
be
to
steal
and
magnus
had
never
stolen
but
faith
being
already
gone
morality
followed
and
he
wrestled
with
his
conscience
and
overcame
it
what
he
was
going
to
do
was
what
men
did
every
day
only
they
called
it
business
and
they
did
it
to
wrong
the
right
whereas
he
would
do
it
to
right
the
wrong
magnus
marshaled
his
reasons
and
justified
himself
here
was
a
man
so
rich
that
he
would
not
know
morning
that
he
had
lost
what
was
sufficient
to
make
his
dear
ones
happy
that
man
was
going
to
expose
them
to
poverty
and
destitution
surely
it
was
right
it
was
necessary
it
was
his
duty
to
prevent
him
in
the
mad
tangle
of
his
disordered
brain
he
saw
everything
that
had
happened
that
day
in
a
sinister
light
and
it
seemed
as
if
fate
had
thrown
the
man
into
his
hands
he
might
have
gone
to
lodge
at
the
parsonage
he
had
come
there
he
might
have
concealed
the
purpose
of
his
coming
he
had
revealed
it
he
might
have
said
nothing
of
the
he
had
shown
it
with
childlike
simplicity
surely
this
was
the
way
out
of
his
difficulties
which
destiny
had
marked
out
for
him
and
not
to
take
it
would
be
to
cover
himself
with
when
his
dear
ones
came
down
to
want
having
persuaded
himself
that
he
could
not
help
but
take
as
much
of
the
stranger
s
money
as
was
necessary
to
pay
the
interest
he
began
to
ask
why
he
should
take
so
little
if
the
in
the
man
s
contained
enough
to
pay
the
interest
twenty
times
over
why
not
take
enough
to
buy
the
farm
out
and
out
that
would
enable
him
to
leave
to
elin
the
inheritance
which
he
had
lost
through
his
brother
s
extravagance
and
crime
this
man
was
about
to
take
it
away
from
her
he
must
not
and
he
should
not
do
so
stage
by
stage
he
pushed
back
the
bulwarks
of
conscience
until
he
came
to
ask
himself
why
he
should
not
take
all
his
mind
was
clogged
and
numb
by
this
time
but
he
knew
well
what
that
meant
it
meant
taking
the
stranger
s
life
there
was
at
first
an
indescribable
horror
in
the
thought
of
killing
a
human
being
but
after
a
moment
it
passed
away
this
man
alone
stood
between
his
dear
ones
and
shelter
why
shouldn
t
he
this
man
threatened
to
take
their
lives
by
exposing
them
to
starvation
why
shouldn
t
he
take
his
life
instead
a
momentary
qualm
came
with
the
thought
that
he
would
be
attacking
one
who
had
trusted
himself
to
the
hospitality
of
his
house
a
defenseless
man
in
his
sleep
but
he
thought
of
the
stranger
s
heartless
laughter
his
callousness
to
their
condition
and
recalled
what
he
had
said
of
his
mother
and
pictured
her
sitting
there
surrounded
by
every
comfort
while
his
own
mother
born
in
that
place
was
turned
out
to
perish
and
then
his
gorge
rose
again
and
his
heart
knew
no
pity
he
began
to
ask
himself
how
it
could
be
done
it
could
be
done
quite
easily
nobody
except
themselves
had
seen
the
man
nobody
else
would
ever
know
that
he
had
been
to
their
house
he
could
tell
his
mother
and
elin
that
the
stranger
had
gone
away
in
the
early
morning
they
would
believe
him
and
even
if
they
did
not
they
would
hold
their
tongues
for
his
interest
would
be
their
interest
and
all
he
would
do
would
be
done
for
them
a
new
and
awful
light
illumined
his
gloomy
mind
and
he
saw
himself
doing
everything
no
other
eye
would
see
no
other
ear
would
hear
it
was
freezing
hard
and
if
it
was
found
in
the
drowning
pool
when
the
ice
melted
the
story
would
be
that
the
stranger
had
lost
his
way
in
the
snowstorm
and
stumbled
over
the
rocks
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
could
defeat
this
world
s
judgment
the
tortured
man
in
the
toils
of
his
temptation
began
to
think
of
the
judgment
of
the
next
but
fear
of
that
vanished
in
a
moment
nothing
was
known
in
the
other
world
of
what
took
place
in
this
one
and
god
interfered
but
little
in
the
affairs
of
men
at
the
thought
of
god
a
singing
noise
came
into
his
ears
like
water
in
the
ears
of
a
drowning
man
it
was
his
conscience
going
down
after
its
last
gasp
for
he
was
telling
himself
that
murder
though
it
might
be
and
contrary
to
god
s
law
god
had
done
nothing
for
him
and
therefore
he
was
not
called
upon
to
do
anything
for
god
he
had
been
a
good
man
all
his
life
yet
god
had
left
him
in
the
lurch
god
and
the
world
were
letting
his
mother
and
elin
perish
therefore
he
must
fight
the
world
and
god
in
the
last
convulsion
of
his
human
nature
he
remembered
that
once
before
the
impulse
to
kill
had
come
to
him
and
that
he
had
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
whenever
afterward
he
had
thought
of
it
but
that
was
different
that
was
in
the
whirlwind
of
outraged
passion
and
if
he
had
carried
out
his
threat
it
would
have
been
the
worst
of
crimes
the
unpardonable
sin
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
a
brother
s
murder
a
thousand
times
he
had
thanked
god
that
oscar
had
not
lived
to
come
home
but
how
strange
were
the
ways
of
fate
another
man
another
heartless
prodigal
had
come
there
and
if
his
dear
ones
were
to
be
saved
from
starvation
and
the
consequences
of
oscar
s
crimes
he
knew
what
he
had
to
do
let
prodigal
pay
for
prodigal
he
thought
again
and
then
he
leaped
up
from
the
bed
his
brute
nature
goaded
on
by
the
flattering
devil
of
drink
had
conquered
his
conscience
yet
his
knees
knocked
together
as
he
went
on
tiptoe
by
his
mother
s
room
and
when
he
came
to
elin
s
door
he
could
hardly
breathe
their
pure
souls
were
sleeping
in
the
protecting
atmosphere
of
prayer
and
when
he
asked
himself
what
he
was
to
say
in
the
morning
if
they
wanted
to
know
where
he
had
got
the
money
his
mind
was
so
clogged
and
numb
that
he
could
find
no
answer
but
this
thought
with
the
vision
that
came
after
it
of
how
his
mother
and
elin
would
look
at
him
with
searching
and
suspicious
glances
of
how
when
all
would
be
over
and
he
hoped
to
be
at
rest
he
would
find
them
sitting
together
in
silence
staring
at
nothing
nearly
broke
down
the
brute
in
him
and
his
whole
body
was
shaken
by
a
kind
of
tearless
sob
nevertheless
the
flash
of
human
light
on
his
dark
heart
only
made
the
blackness
more
profound
and
after
a
moment
he
went
on
with
his
preparations
when
he
stepped
on
tiptoe
into
the
hall
the
two
who
had
been
sleeping
on
the
mat
by
the
door
got
up
and
stretched
themselves
and
yawned
and
lest
they
should
make
a
noise
he
took
them
out
and
locked
them
up
in
a
shed
after
that
he
went
over
to
the
stable
which
was
at
some
distance
from
the
dwelling
and
saddled
and
bridled
the
stranger
s
mare
and
then
with
a
sharp
cut
of
his
whip
he
sent
her
galloping
and
whinnying
into
the
darkness
a
breath
of
icy
wind
was
coming
down
the
valley
as
if
day
were
stirring
in
its
morning
sleep
and
a
faint
pink
and
white
light
in
the
eastern
sky
with
a
glint
on
the
western
glaciers
seemed
to
say
that
the
dawn
was
near
but
the
drink
was
in
magnus
s
eyes
and
he
could
not
see
clearly
no
snow
had
fallen
since
the
traveler
arrived
and
returning
to
the
front
of
the
farmstead
magnus
made
backward
tracks
from
the
porch
to
the
river
partly
in
order
to
obliterate
the
stranger
s
footsteps
and
partly
to
conceal
his
own
when
he
should
come
out
again
carrying
a
heavy
burden
the
man
was
gone
by
this
time
and
magnus
was
like
a
hovering
about
his
own
house
and
thinking
of
his
prey
when
he
returned
to
the
hall
there
was
no
sound
there
except
that
of
the
ashes
slipping
in
the
stove
and
of
the
clock
ticking
in
the
darkness
the
deliberate
seconds
he
took
off
his
boots
leaving
on
his
only
and
then
he
picked
up
a
large
cushion
from
the
and
stepped
to
the
stranger
s
door
and
listened
but
heaven
as
well
as
hell
is
in
the
heart
of
every
man
as
long
as
life
is
with
him
and
the
tearless
sob
came
back
to
magnus
and
shook
his
whole
body
as
he
thought
at
the
last
moment
of
the
awful
pity
of
the
thing
he
had
to
do
yet
telling
himself
again
that
god
did
nothing
in
this
world
and
saying
once
more
let
prodigal
pay
for
prodigal
he
turned
the
handle
and
opened
the
door
then
he
stepped
softly
into
the
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
anna
at
that
moment
had
awakened
from
a
frightening
dream
on
first
going
to
her
room
she
had
been
troubled
by
the
memory
of
what
she
had
done
to
awaken
evil
thoughts
in
magnus
and
visions
had
come
to
her
of
how
if
anything
happened
magnus
might
say
you
put
it
into
my
head
mother
to
banish
her
she
had
said
a
prayer
for
forgiveness
telling
god
she
had
never
once
thought
of
theft
or
violence
but
only
of
magnus
and
elin
and
the
inheritance
they
had
lost
through
her
importunity
and
how
cruel
it
seemed
that
while
other
people
had
so
much
more
than
they
wanted
such
hard
times
should
come
to
her
dear
children
then
she
had
gone
to
bed
and
the
voice
of
the
stranger
which
had
teased
her
all
the
evening
through
with
memories
she
could
not
fix
haunted
her
again
and
the
light
being
out
and
her
eyes
no
longer
disturbed
by
sight
of
the
stranger
s
different
face
she
knew
whose
voice
it
reminded
her
of
it
was
a
voice
very
dear
to
her
a
voice
always
near
to
her
oscar
s
voice
which
she
was
never
to
hear
again
when
with
a
thrill
of
the
heart
this
thought
came
to
anna
it
altered
the
stranger
altogether
his
laughter
ceased
to
be
cruel
and
what
he
had
said
of
himself
not
being
a
good
son
became
touching
and
when
she
thought
of
his
poor
mother
waiting
for
her
prodigal
and
so
soon
to
see
him
home
again
and
pictured
her
joy
when
he
should
say
mother
mother
i
m
here
at
last
and
we
shall
never
never
be
parted
again
her
heart
overflowed
with
sympathy
and
she
was
sorry
she
had
not
been
kinder
to
him
when
he
was
going
to
bed
then
she
went
to
sleep
and
the
dream
spirit
took
her
back
to
the
good
time
when
she
had
two
boys
in
her
house
a
dark
one
and
a
fair
one
and
the
father
had
punished
the
dark
one
unjustly
and
his
stern
and
gloomy
soul
with
its
sense
of
wrong
would
not
suffer
him
to
explain
but
the
fair
one
was
sobbing
out
a
confession
it
was
not
magnus
it
was
me
papa
and
a
moment
afterward
two
happy
little
heads
were
on
the
same
pillow
side
by
side
and
both
were
laughing
merrily
in
the
shifting
kaleidoscope
of
her
dream
this
picture
had
hardly
gone
when
anna
awoke
with
the
clearest
consciousness
of
oscar
s
voice
crying
mother
mother
mother
she
thought
it
must
have
been
the
stranger
calling
in
his
sleep
for
the
china
ornaments
on
her
seemed
to
ring
but
when
she
listened
there
was
no
other
sound
then
the
memory
of
magnus
s
temptation
came
rolling
back
on
her
like
a
thundercloud
over
a
clear
sky
and
she
got
up
to
go
to
her
son
s
room
to
make
sure
that
he
was
in
bed
magnus
had
not
been
to
bed
with
candle
in
hand
and
still
in
her
anna
hurried
to
the
hall
crying
in
a
whisper
of
only
apprehension
magnus
magnus
there
was
no
reply
she
listened
at
the
stranger
s
door
and
thought
she
heard
a
movement
inside
the
room
but
she
dared
not
enter
or
knock
magnus
magnus
she
whispered
again
but
no
answer
came
back
to
her
she
heard
the
neighing
of
a
horse
that
seemed
to
be
running
round
and
round
the
house
and
her
flesh
began
to
creep
for
that
sound
in
the
night
was
like
the
cry
of
a
disembodied
soul
then
there
came
the
deadened
noise
of
dogs
barking
and
she
knew
they
were
their
own
dogs
and
that
they
must
have
been
shut
up
in
an
outhouse
this
started
a
new
thought
and
she
ran
to
the
outer
door
to
see
if
it
had
been
opened
the
door
was
unbolted
she
was
about
to
open
it
and
cry
again
when
she
heard
a
noise
behind
her
it
came
from
the
stranger
s
room
and
putting
her
ear
to
the
door
she
distinctly
heard
the
sounds
of
sobs
some
one
inside
was
sobbing
she
knew
the
low
stifled
voice
it
was
magnus
he
was
on
his
knees
or
prostrate
on
the
floor
and
he
was
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
at
that
anna
boldly
tried
to
open
the
door
but
found
it
fastened
on
the
inside
magnus
magnus
she
whispered
but
he
did
not
answer
she
was
now
sure
that
the
awful
thing
she
had
thought
of
had
come
to
pass
her
suspense
had
deepened
to
fear
but
pity
and
love
conquered
every
other
feeling
and
going
down
on
her
knees
in
her
she
whispered
through
the
magnus
magnus
open
the
door
it
is
only
mother
it
was
all
my
fault
dear
let
me
come
in
but
the
smothered
sobbing
inside
continued
and
no
other
sound
came
back
to
her
then
in
the
silence
of
all
else
she
heard
the
sound
of
outside
at
first
she
thought
this
must
be
a
ringing
in
her
ears
but
the
bells
grew
louder
and
came
nearer
and
then
the
dogs
in
the
outhouse
barked
again
fear
deepened
to
terror
the
necessity
for
concealment
flashed
upon
her
and
she
knocked
at
the
bedroom
door
and
cried
in
the
same
affrighted
whisper
magnus
there
is
some
one
coming
wait
till
he
has
gone
don
t
stir
don
t
come
out
only
tell
me
you
hear
me
the
sobbing
ceased
but
magnus
did
not
speak
meantime
the
came
nearer
and
nearer
with
the
cracking
of
a
whip
the
whoop
of
a
driver
and
the
hiss
of
runners
in
the
soft
snow
magnus
magnus
cried
anna
loudly
in
a
last
effort
but
she
was
stopped
by
the
near
shout
of
some
one
outside
helloa
helloa
there
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
with
an
intention
of
bolting
the
outer
door
before
she
could
do
so
there
was
a
metallic
knock
on
the
a
voice
crying
god
be
with
you
and
footsteps
hurrying
up
the
outer
steps
then
anna
turned
about
and
fled
back
to
her
bedroom
while
she
dressed
she
heard
the
outer
door
thrown
open
and
the
sound
of
many
persons
trooping
into
the
hall
they
were
very
bright
and
happy
for
they
laughed
merrily
and
talked
all
together
and
the
house
was
full
of
noise
when
she
came
out
of
the
badstofa
she
met
the
postboy
on
his
way
to
the
to
boil
water
to
give
his
ponies
a
hot
drink
and
on
returning
to
the
hall
she
found
the
door
and
the
shutters
of
the
window
open
the
daylight
streaming
in
and
the
postman
himself
there
with
several
passengers
including
the
factor
who
was
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
and
margret
neilsen
who
was
unrolling
herself
from
the
folds
of
a
white
bearskin
helloa
cried
everybody
and
the
postman
said
here
we
are
at
last
you
see
we
couldn
t
come
yesterday
by
reason
of
the
snowstorm
but
the
factor
actually
got
me
to
start
away
as
soon
as
it
stopped
at
eleven
o
clock
last
night
eleven
well
we
don
t
kill
a
pig
every
day
do
we
said
the
factor
and
while
the
men
laughed
and
winked
margret
neilsen
said
and
how
s
anna
anna
was
speechless
and
ghastly
white
so
the
factor
said
we
seem
to
have
startled
her
out
of
her
senses
for
she
looks
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
but
where
s
magnus
magnus
oh
somewhere
about
said
anna
and
how
s
my
precious
elin
said
aunt
margret
she
s
not
up
yet
said
anna
then
i
ll
go
and
waken
her
which
is
her
room
this
one
said
aunt
margret
making
for
the
no
no
said
anna
intercepting
her
and
standing
with
her
back
to
the
door
that
one
and
aunt
margret
went
into
elin
s
bedroom
and
now
said
the
factor
with
winks
all
round
him
what
about
the
other
one
anna
looked
at
the
factor
in
mute
terror
the
you
know
not
stirring
yet
i
suppose
well
guest
friend
whatever
you
choose
to
call
him
what
friend
why
the
friend
who
came
last
night
of
course
anna
who
had
never
lied
in
her
life
wanted
to
lie
now
but
she
could
not
do
so
i
don
t
understand
you
factor
she
said
faintly
well
said
the
factor
and
then
as
if
by
an
afterthought
i
thought
he
wouldn
t
wish
to
startle
you
having
been
so
long
away
and
supposed
to
be
dead
but
don
t
you
know
yet
who
he
is
anna
trembled
and
said
of
whom
are
you
speaking
oscar
neilsen
of
the
tall
fair
man
with
the
pointed
beard
who
came
to
lodge
at
your
house
last
night
anna
was
now
speechless
with
terror
and
the
company
misunderstanding
her
silence
became
suddenly
very
grave
can
it
be
possible
that
he
lost
his
way
in
the
snowstorm
said
one
but
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
road
and
could
find
his
way
blindfold
said
another
such
a
night
though
said
a
third
he
got
as
far
as
the
house
of
rest
but
the
boy
there
said
he
would
never
see
the
end
of
his
journey
well
this
is
serious
said
the
factor
the
minister
wanted
him
to
stay
at
government
house
but
he
seemed
so
anxious
to
see
you
to
see
me
said
anna
naturally
after
his
long
absence
strange
very
strange
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
no
traveler
came
here
last
night
a
vague
shadow
of
the
factor
s
meaning
had
flashed
upon
anna
s
mind
and
the
terror
of
a
moment
ago
had
deepened
to
horror
what
had
magnus
done
in
the
blindness
of
his
passion
and
despair
but
even
then
the
desire
to
save
her
son
was
above
all
other
emotions
and
she
was
about
to
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
traveler
when
the
door
behind
her
was
opened
and
a
voice
over
her
shoulder
said
yes
a
traveler
did
come
here
last
night
but
he
went
away
again
in
the
early
morning
it
was
magnus
and
when
anna
turned
to
look
at
him
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
for
she
knew
he
was
telling
the
truth
his
face
since
she
saw
it
last
had
undergone
a
mysterious
and
miraculous
change
the
gloomy
arrogance
of
despair
had
gone
something
had
carried
light
into
the
darkness
of
his
soul
and
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
come
as
from
the
immediate
presence
of
his
god
but
this
is
stranger
than
ever
said
the
factor
it
was
known
that
he
had
taken
a
large
sum
of
money
out
of
the
bank
and
everybody
supposed
he
meant
to
buy
up
this
place
at
the
auction
yes
said
aunt
margret
coming
out
of
elin
s
bedroom
to
give
to
his
old
mother
and
then
elin
s
soft
voice
was
heard
to
say
has
the
sheriff
come
yet
who
is
asking
for
the
sheriff
said
the
sheriff
himself
coming
forward
at
that
moment
the
gentleman
gave
me
this
last
night
and
told
me
to
deliver
it
to
you
before
the
auction
began
this
morning
it
s
not
for
me
though
said
the
sheriff
who
had
taken
the
to
the
table
and
opened
it
and
was
reading
the
writing
on
the
sheet
of
paper
which
fell
out
first
for
elin
oscar
s
daughter
from
christian
a
present
for
elin
perhaps
said
the
factor
a
note
cried
the
sheriff
the
gaiety
of
the
company
was
breaking
into
loud
congratulations
when
the
sheriff
who
was
still
opening
the
folds
of
the
said
wait
there
s
more
than
that
much
more
one
two
three
fifty
thousand
another
and
another
and
then
the
rapid
rustling
of
followed
by
the
delighted
cry
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
the
very
sum
he
took
out
of
the
bank
said
the
factor
kiss
me
my
precious
said
aunt
margret
me
too
granddaughter
cried
the
factor
anna
looked
stunned
and
magnus
like
one
who
wished
the
earth
to
swallow
him
but
the
factor
rattled
along
with
shouts
and
laughter
now
i
understand
everything
he
has
given
the
money
to
the
girl
but
left
it
to
her
friends
and
relations
to
advise
her
as
to
what
she
is
to
do
with
it
elin
s
blue
eyes
being
still
full
of
bewilderment
the
factor
kissed
her
again
and
said
now
who
do
you
think
has
left
you
this
great
fortune
little
one
christian
christiansson
said
the
girl
certainly
but
don
t
you
know
who
christian
christiansson
is
no
you
neither
anna
anna
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
discovery
who
she
said
but
rather
with
her
lips
than
with
her
voice
why
oscar
your
son
oscar
who
isn
t
dead
at
all
and
has
come
back
and
made
amends
to
everybody
i
always
knew
there
was
good
stuff
in
my
godson
the
truth
burst
on
anna
in
a
whirlwind
of
joy
joy
that
her
son
was
alive
joy
that
he
had
come
home
and
justified
her
faith
in
him
joy
too
though
with
a
twinge
of
pain
in
it
that
he
had
gone
away
again
and
further
trouble
with
magnus
was
averted
a
prayer
gushed
from
her
heart
and
she
wanted
to
go
down
on
her
knees
my
son
she
said
in
a
breathless
whisper
my
father
said
elin
with
a
tenderness
the
word
had
never
had
for
her
before
the
company
were
now
cackling
and
crowing
again
but
the
two
women
the
old
one
and
the
young
one
looked
round
for
magnus
he
was
standing
at
the
back
his
strong
face
all
broken
up
and
melted
it
was
not
at
this
moment
that
the
truth
had
first
burst
on
him
that
had
come
like
a
blinding
blow
of
light
the
instant
he
had
entered
the
and
realized
that
god
did
something
after
all
in
this
world
for
his
children
mother
elin
he
stammered
and
he
opened
his
arms
to
them
it
s
the
miracle
isn
t
it
said
the
girl
it
was
the
miracle
indeed
there
was
no
auction
in
thingvellir
that
day
and
when
the
bells
rang
for
service
the
company
went
to
church
the
little
wooden
tabernacle
was
full
of
worshippers
for
it
was
new
year
s
day
and
the
farmers
had
ridden
over
with
their
families
from
all
the
country
round
about
they
sat
in
their
thick
mufflers
and
and
the
mist
of
their
smoking
breath
as
far
up
the
church
as
the
square
rail
enclosing
the
communion
table
on
stools
about
the
octagonal
pulpit
and
even
among
the
refuse
the
lumber
and
barrels
that
were
stored
in
the
gallery
the
factor
was
there
very
loud
in
his
responses
fixing
up
the
figures
on
the
tin
plate
which
announced
the
hymns
elin
too
with
the
wonder
not
yet
gone
from
her
innocent
blue
eyes
anna
with
her
tempered
happiness
and
a
heart
overflowing
with
thanksgiving
and
most
strange
of
all
magnus
himself
a
changed
and
humbled
man
everybody
looked
at
magnus
in
surprise
at
seeing
him
there
but
magnus
looked
at
no
one
while
the
pastor
read
the
lesson
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
while
he
gave
out
his
text
this
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
while
he
preached
his
homely
sermon
on
the
conversion
of
the
dying
thief
on
the
cross
showing
the
shortness
of
time
the
power
of
redemption
and
the
certainty
of
death
s
sundering
and
even
while
the
deacon
chanted
the
anthem
weeping
may
endure
for
a
night
but
joy
cometh
in
the
morning
and
the
congregation
sang
the
closing
hymn
and
elin
s
silvery
young
voice
ringing
up
to
the
round
ceiling
reminded
him
of
her
mother
s
magnus
sat
with
his
face
toward
the
picture
on
the
wall
above
the
it
was
a
picture
of
christ
in
white
robes
and
among
warm
eastern
foliage
healing
the
blind
man
by
the
wayside
and
while
he
looked
at
it
a
great
softening
of
the
heart
came
to
him
for
he
thought
of
the
blessed
but
awful
moment
only
just
passed
when
the
scales
fell
from
his
own
eyes
and
his
naked
soul
stood
face
to
face
with
its
maker
that
was
the
moment
when
with
murder
in
his
mind
and
a
spirit
of
war
with
god
he
had
entered
the
stranger
s
bedroom
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
and
then
found
that
his
victim
had
been
snatched
out
of
his
hands
and
heard
a
fearful
voice
which
seemed
to
say
stop
or
the
voice
of
thy
brother
s
blood
will
cry
unto
me
from
the
ground
when
the
service
was
over
there
was
much
handshaking
and
outside
the
porch
for
rumor
of
what
had
happened
in
anna
s
household
had
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
but
magnus
took
his
old
mother
on
his
arm
and
walked
home
with
her
alone
except
for
elin
who
tripped
through
the
crisp
snow
by
their
side
humming
a
little
of
the
last
hymn
the
young
people
were
racing
the
ponies
to
and
fro
in
their
joy
of
the
first
snow
the
old
ones
were
gossiping
in
groups
on
the
exciting
news
of
the
day
and
the
factor
who
was
swinging
along
in
his
with
a
contented
expression
like
an
old
cow
going
home
in
the
evening
with
her
udder
full
was
saluting
everybody
and
inviting
all
and
sundry
to
the
for
a
cup
of
coffee
it
was
more
than
a
cup
of
coffee
he
had
had
prepared
for
them
for
assuming
command
while
magnus
seemed
paralyzed
by
surprise
he
had
ordered
a
lamb
to
be
killed
and
aunt
margret
remained
behind
to
roast
it
the
dinner
was
a
large
and
long
one
for
everybody
was
welcome
to
it
and
before
it
came
to
an
end
the
factor
rose
to
propose
a
toast
every
has
an
end
he
said
and
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
all
that
the
cloud
that
has
hung
so
long
over
the
over
anna
magnusson
s
family
and
over
my
family
is
now
gone
for
good
show
the
man
and
not
the
table
says
one
of
our
sagas
but
in
this
case
we
have
had
to
show
you
the
table
and
not
the
man
he
will
be
on
his
way
to
reykjavik
by
this
time
i
suppose
and
if
prophecy
is
the
wise
man
s
guess
i
guess
he
will
get
such
a
rousing
welcome
there
as
no
man
ever
had
in
this
old
island
before
brothers
and
sisters
i
give
you
a
health
anna
s
son
son
iceland
s
son
oscar
the
toast
was
received
with
shouts
and
the
jingling
of
glasses
but
anna
did
not
drink
and
magnus
dropped
his
head
on
the
east
of
the
plain
and
the
lake
of
thingvellir
there
is
a
pass
going
over
the
mountain
of
hengel
to
the
little
trading
station
of
eyrarbakki
it
winds
through
a
number
of
geysers
and
mineral
springs
which
seem
to
be
always
smoking
against
the
bare
side
of
the
fell
they
are
little
pools
of
simmering
water
in
the
crusted
yellow
earth
some
of
them
white
and
sparkling
as
a
star
some
round
and
as
a
woman
s
eye
some
oval
and
like
the
living
heart
of
some
monstrous
animal
you
walk
warily
on
the
path
between
for
the
earth
is
hot
and
thin
under
his
feet
and
sometimes
it
throbs
like
the
lid
of
a
boiling
kettle
and
sometimes
there
is
a
smothered
roar
beneath
you
as
of
mighty
battles
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
then
the
pools
begin
to
boil
and
send
up
spouts
of
foaming
water
and
tongues
of
liquid
flame
and
the
air
is
full
of
sulphurous
vapor
an
awful
evil
and
devilish
place
looking
like
a
cauldron
over
a
circle
of
hellish
fire
but
higher
up
the
pass
the
snow
lies
white
and
calm
and
crisp
and
higher
still
are
the
glistening
glaciers
and
there
while
the
mountain
quakes
in
its
volcanic
throes
the
avalanche
comes
down
in
winter
so
suddenly
that
no
man
can
hear
or
see
it
for
it
is
loud
as
the
crack
of
doom
and
swift
as
the
shaft
of
death
at
daybreak
that
day
christian
christiansson
was
crossing
this
pass
on
his
way
to
eyrarbakki
intending
to
take
ship
to
norway
although
it
was
only
two
hours
since
he
had
pushed
open
the
window
and
left
the
he
was
already
a
stronger
and
braver
man
then
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
ending
everything
and
the
shadow
of
had
floated
before
him
but
now
he
saw
clearly
that
until
god
ordained
he
should
die
it
was
his
duty
to
live
as
he
had
sinned
so
he
should
suffer
he
must
pay
his
penalty
to
its
last
pang
its
uttermost
moment
his
penalty
was
to
live
on
without
the
love
he
had
forfeited
the
happiness
he
had
lost
the
right
to
claim
it
was
hard
but
it
was
just
and
he
must
face
the
end
without
flinching
welcome
life
then
as
long
as
it
lasted
welcome
death
when
it
was
due
after
he
had
passed
through
the
heat
and
smoke
and
come
out
on
the
clear
heights
beyond
he
paused
to
look
back
the
world
around
was
all
white
and
stark
under
the
snow
of
last
night
s
storm
but
a
crimson
shaft
from
the
sun
which
had
not
yet
risen
was
crossing
the
topmost
peaks
and
the
lowlands
were
still
sleeping
in
a
veil
of
mist
he
thought
he
could
hear
the
ringing
of
the
church
bell
and
that
sweet
human
sound
came
winging
its
way
up
to
him
through
the
vapor
of
the
as
the
singing
of
a
star
might
rise
through
the
clouds
of
the
world
to
the
ears
of
the
souls
in
heaven
presently
the
sun
strode
up
and
the
mist
fell
back
and
then
he
saw
in
the
valley
far
below
the
little
church
itself
and
the
home
he
had
left
behind
him
he
had
left
happiness
there
and
love
and
warm
comfort
for
that
was
his
reparation
to
the
dear
ones
he
had
injured
and
now
for
his
atonement
to
god
he
was
going
out
alone
stripped
of
everything
and
unknown
to
any
one
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
bear
to
think
of
that
but
he
smiled
to
himself
sadly
while
he
pictured
the
surprise
and
joy
of
the
happy
scene
when
the
girl
would
come
out
with
the
and
the
auction
would
be
stopped
he
thought
too
of
his
mother
in
church
with
a
soul
full
of
gratitude
and
saw
elin
with
a
ray
of
sunlight
from
the
window
on
the
sweetness
of
her
smile
it
was
not
thus
that
he
had
expected
to
leave
them
when
for
ten
years
he
had
worked
by
the
sweat
of
body
and
spirit
that
he
might
come
back
and
be
forgiven
but
it
was
not
in
this
world
that
the
prodigal
could
be
taken
back
not
here
that
any
earthly
father
could
run
to
meet
him
and
throw
his
arms
about
his
neck
what
he
had
sown
he
must
reap
and
not
all
his
penitence
and
tears
could
undo
what
he
had
done
it
was
long
before
he
could
take
his
last
look
at
the
home
he
was
leaving
forever
and
when
at
length
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
went
on
he
had
to
comfort
himself
with
the
thought
that
thora
would
be
pleased
with
him
for
giving
up
their
child
to
magnus
her
voice
from
the
other
world
seemed
to
come
to
him
and
say
well
done
poor
brave
wounded
heart
god
s
angels
rejoice
over
you
but
it
was
hard
to
find
solace
in
heavenly
cheer
while
his
blood
ran
warm
and
yearned
for
human
company
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
glaciers
those
great
lone
homes
of
nature
never
trodden
by
the
foot
of
man
or
animal
where
no
bird
sings
and
no
flower
grows
where
only
the
wind
moans
over
motionless
billows
of
ice
and
the
sun
rises
in
a
blank
barrenness
on
chasms
of
the
frozen
deep
looking
back
from
this
place
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
valley
and
the
houses
of
men
or
of
anything
but
a
wide
circle
of
mountain
peaks
all
silent
and
white
in
which
he
was
the
only
living
thing
and
then
the
feeling
of
being
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
humanity
amid
these
grand
but
grim
surroundings
elevated
his
senses
and
affected
him
like
music
like
composing
with
a
sort
of
ecstacy
which
was
part
rapture
and
partly
pain
in
this
ecstasy
of
emotion
he
asked
himself
if
his
life
had
been
wasted
if
happiness
was
gone
from
him
even
if
because
he
had
sinned
there
was
nothing
before
him
now
but
renunciation
and
suffering
and
then
the
teaching
of
his
childhood
came
back
to
him
with
a
new
and
sublime
significance
and
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
lesson
of
life
and
the
meaning
of
death
the
lesson
of
life
was
duty
to
do
right
without
expectation
of
reward
or
fear
of
punishment
and
the
meaning
of
death
was
to
bring
to
the
sinful
penitent
soul
the
pardon
the
world
can
not
give
then
thank
god
for
life
but
thank
god
for
death
also
whatever
a
man
s
sin
nature
could
not
forget
it
and
the
laws
of
life
could
not
forgive
but
the
mercy
of
god
was
without
measure
of
guilt
and
the
gates
of
heaven
were
wide
god
veiled
his
face
from
his
creatures
and
to
man
s
questioning
eyes
the
infinite
wisdom
was
as
blank
as
these
white
walls
of
ice
and
snow
but
two
thousand
years
ago
a
simple
galilean
had
read
this
riddle
of
life
as
no
man
before
or
since
has
read
it
he
had
read
it
for
all
men
good
or
bad
but
most
of
all
for
wayworn
sinners
like
himself
for
whom
the
world
has
no
pity
and
no
forgiveness
and
though
he
was
the
guiltiest
of
the
guilty
and
his
sin
had
found
him
out
and
as
the
price
of
his
repentance
he
had
had
to
give
up
everything
in
life
that
he
held
most
dear
the
love
of
his
child
and
the
hope
of
pardon
and
reconciliation
yet
love
and
pardon
and
reconciliation
were
waiting
for
him
still
when
god
s
own
voice
should
call
him
and
this
mortal
should
put
on
immortality
by
this
time
he
was
in
that
mood
in
which
a
man
of
his
temperament
finds
it
difficult
to
distinguish
the
real
from
the
imaginary
in
which
he
hears
the
sounds
of
nature
and
mistakes
them
for
voices
from
the
other
world
he
had
wandered
without
knowing
it
from
the
path
of
the
pass
which
was
marked
by
stones
standing
upright
out
of
the
snow
when
the
volcanic
fire
in
the
womb
of
the
mountain
began
to
shake
it
with
mighty
throbs
and
then
suddenly
the
awful
stillness
was
broken
by
a
crash
and
a
resounding
rumble
as
of
echoing
thunder
coming
down
from
the
heights
oscar
stephenson
did
not
see
or
hear
or
feel
anything
he
was
only
conscious
of
a
burst
of
heavenly
music
of
a
sense
of
ten
thousand
angels
singing
an
anthem
a
triumphant
pæan
of
praise
that
grew
louder
and
louder
every
moment
a
sense
of
blinding
light
and
of
traveling
at
a
terrific
velocity
into
the
realms
of
the
sun
a
sense
of
the
day
of
judgment
of
the
life
of
the
world
being
over
its
busy
throngs
gone
its
pageants
finished
its
honors
distinctions
castes
gold
wealth
and
fame
passed
into
nothingness
a
sense
of
being
outside
the
great
judgment
hall
with
an
infinite
multitude
of
kings
and
beggars
good
men
and
bad
the
guilty
and
the
innocent
and
of
kneeling
there
among
the
meanest
and
most
ashamed
a
sense
of
a
spirit
stooping
to
him
and
taking
his
hand
and
saying
come
of
looking
up
into
her
face
and
seeing
it
was
thora
and
of
his
breath
coming
so
fast
and
short
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
a
sense
of
stumbling
along
with
his
head
down
and
the
spirit
leading
him
forward
and
singing
as
they
ascended
a
sense
of
an
overwhelming
presence
somewhere
in
front
of
him
of
the
music
dying
down
and
becoming
fainter
and
fainter
and
then
of
an
awful
hush
and
of
a
blessed
voice
which
said
for
this
my
son
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
was
lost
and
is
found
a
moment
afterward
there
was
no
one
on
hengel
mountain
the
great
lone
home
of
nature
was
calm
and
white
and
silent
the
end
