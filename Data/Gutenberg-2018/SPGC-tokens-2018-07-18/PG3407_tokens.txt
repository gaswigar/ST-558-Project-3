why
do
you
come
to
egypt
do
you
come
to
gain
a
dream
or
to
regain
lost
dreams
of
old
to
gild
your
life
with
the
drowsy
gold
of
romance
to
lose
a
creeping
sorrow
to
forget
that
too
many
of
your
hours
are
sullen
grey
bereft
what
do
you
wish
of
egypt
the
sphinx
will
not
ask
you
will
not
care
the
pyramids
lifting
their
unnumbered
stones
to
the
clear
and
wonderful
skies
have
held
still
hold
their
secrets
but
they
do
not
seek
for
yours
the
terrific
temples
the
hot
mysterious
tombs
odorous
of
the
dead
desires
of
men
crouching
in
and
under
the
immeasurable
sands
will
muck
you
with
their
brooding
silence
with
their
dim
and
sombre
repose
the
brown
children
of
the
nile
the
toilers
who
sing
their
antique
songs
by
the
shadoof
and
the
sakieh
the
dragomans
the
smiling
goblin
merchants
the
bedouins
who
lead
your
camel
into
the
pale
recesses
of
the
dunes
these
will
not
trouble
themselves
about
your
deep
desires
your
perhaps
yearning
hunger
of
the
heart
and
the
imagination
yet
egypt
is
not
unresponsive
i
came
back
to
her
with
dread
after
fourteen
years
of
absence
years
filled
for
me
with
the
rumors
of
her
changes
and
on
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
she
calmly
reassured
me
she
told
me
in
her
supremely
magical
way
that
all
was
well
with
her
she
taught
me
once
more
a
lesson
i
had
not
quite
forgotten
but
that
i
was
glad
to
learn
again
the
lesson
that
egypt
owes
her
most
subtle
most
inner
beauty
to
kheper
although
she
owes
her
marvels
to
men
that
when
he
created
the
sun
which
shines
upon
her
he
gave
her
the
lustre
of
her
life
and
that
those
who
come
to
her
must
be
if
they
would
truly
and
intimately
understand
the
treasure
or
romance
that
lies
heaped
within
her
bosom
thoth
says
the
old
legend
travelled
in
the
boat
of
the
sun
if
you
would
love
egypt
rightly
you
too
must
be
a
traveller
in
that
bark
you
must
not
fear
to
steep
yourself
in
the
mystery
of
gold
in
the
mystery
of
heat
in
the
mystery
of
silence
that
seems
softly
showered
out
of
the
sun
the
sacred
white
lotus
must
be
your
emblem
and
horus
the
merged
in
ra
your
special
deity
scarcely
had
i
set
foot
once
more
in
egypt
before
thoth
lifted
me
into
the
boat
of
the
sun
and
soothed
my
fears
to
sleep
i
arrived
in
cairo
i
saw
new
and
vast
hotels
i
saw
crowded
streets
brilliant
shops
english
officials
driving
importantly
in
victorias
surely
to
pay
dreadful
calls
of
ceremony
women
in
gigantic
hats
with
niagaras
of
veil
waving
white
gloves
as
they
talked
of
i
guess
the
latest
cairene
scandal
i
perceived
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
waiters
created
in
switzerland
hall
porters
made
in
germany
levantine
touts
determined
jews
holding
false
antiquities
in
their
lean
fingers
an
english
baptist
minister
in
a
white
helmet
drinking
chocolate
on
a
terrace
with
a
in
one
fist
a
ticket
to
visit
monuments
in
the
other
i
heard
scottish
soldiers
playing
i
ll
be
in
scotland
before
ye
and
something
within
me
a
lurking
hope
i
suppose
seemed
to
founder
and
collapse
but
only
for
a
moment
it
was
after
four
in
the
afternoon
soon
day
would
be
declining
and
i
seemed
to
remember
that
the
decline
of
day
in
egypt
had
moved
me
long
ago
moved
me
as
few
rare
things
have
ever
done
within
half
an
hour
i
was
alone
far
up
the
long
road
ismail
s
road
that
leads
from
the
suburbs
of
cairo
to
the
pyramids
and
then
egypt
took
me
like
a
child
by
the
hand
and
reassured
me
it
was
the
first
week
of
november
high
nile
had
not
subsided
and
all
the
land
here
between
the
river
and
the
sand
where
the
sphinx
keeps
watch
was
hidden
beneath
the
vast
and
tranquil
waters
of
what
seemed
a
tideless
sea
a
sea
fringed
with
dense
masses
of
girdled
in
the
far
distance
by
that
kept
the
white
and
the
brown
houses
in
their
feathery
embrace
above
these
isolated
houses
pigeons
circled
in
the
distance
the
lateen
sails
of
boats
glided
sometimes
behind
the
palms
coming
into
view
vanishing
and
mysteriously
reappearing
among
their
narrow
trunks
here
and
there
a
living
thing
moved
slowly
wading
homeward
through
this
sea
a
camel
from
the
sands
of
ghizeh
a
buffalo
two
donkeys
followed
by
boys
who
held
with
brown
hands
their
dark
blue
skirts
near
their
faces
a
bedouin
leaning
forward
upon
the
neck
of
his
quickly
stepping
horse
at
one
moment
i
seemed
to
look
upon
the
lagoons
of
venice
a
watery
vision
full
of
a
glassy
calm
then
the
in
the
water
and
growing
to
its
edge
the
pale
sands
that
far
as
the
eyes
could
see
from
ghizeh
to
sakkara
and
beyond
fringed
it
toward
the
west
made
me
think
of
the
pacific
of
palmy
islands
of
a
paradise
where
men
grow
drowsy
in
and
dream
away
the
years
and
then
i
looked
farther
beyond
the
pallid
line
of
the
sands
and
i
saw
a
pyramid
of
gold
the
wonder
khufu
had
built
as
a
golden
wonder
it
saluted
me
after
all
my
years
of
absence
later
i
was
to
see
it
grey
as
grey
sands
sulphur
color
in
the
afternoon
from
very
near
at
hand
black
as
a
monument
draped
in
funereal
velvet
for
a
mourning
under
the
stars
at
night
white
as
a
monstrous
marble
tomb
soon
after
dawn
from
the
between
it
and
sakkara
but
as
a
golden
thing
it
greeted
me
as
a
golden
miracle
i
shall
remember
it
slowly
the
sun
went
down
the
second
pyramid
seemed
also
made
of
gold
drowsily
splendid
it
and
its
greater
brother
looked
set
on
the
golden
sands
beneath
the
golden
sky
and
now
the
gold
came
traveling
down
from
the
desert
to
the
water
turning
it
surely
to
a
wine
like
the
wine
of
gold
that
flowed
down
midas
s
throat
then
as
the
magic
grew
to
a
pactolus
and
at
last
to
a
great
surface
that
resembled
golden
ice
hard
glittering
unbroken
by
any
ruffling
wave
the
islands
rising
from
this
golden
ice
were
jet
black
the
houses
black
the
palms
and
their
shadows
that
fell
upon
the
marvel
black
black
were
the
birds
that
flew
low
from
roof
to
roof
black
the
wading
camels
black
the
meeting
leaves
of
the
tall
that
formed
a
tunnel
from
where
i
stood
to
mena
house
and
presently
a
huge
black
pyramid
lay
supine
on
the
gold
and
near
it
a
shadowy
brother
seemed
more
humble
than
it
but
scarcely
less
mysterious
the
gold
deepened
glowed
more
fiercely
in
the
sky
above
the
pyramids
hung
tiny
cloud
wreaths
of
rose
red
delicate
and
airy
as
the
gossamers
of
tunis
as
i
turned
far
off
in
cairo
i
saw
the
first
lights
glittering
across
the
fields
of
doura
silvery
white
like
diamonds
but
the
silver
did
not
call
me
my
imagination
was
held
captive
by
the
gold
i
was
summoned
by
the
gold
and
i
went
on
under
the
black
on
ismail
s
road
toward
it
and
i
dwelt
in
it
many
days
the
wonders
of
egypt
man
has
made
seem
to
increase
in
stature
before
the
spirits
eyes
as
man
learns
to
know
them
better
to
tower
up
ever
higher
till
the
imagination
is
almost
stricken
by
their
looming
greatness
climb
the
great
pyramid
spend
a
day
with
abou
on
its
summit
come
down
penetrate
into
its
recesses
stand
in
the
king
s
chamber
listen
to
the
silence
there
feel
it
with
your
hands
is
it
not
tangible
in
this
hot
fastness
of
incorruptible
death
creep
like
the
surreptitious
midget
you
feel
yourself
to
be
up
those
long
and
steep
inclines
of
polished
stone
watching
the
gloomy
darkness
of
the
narrow
walls
the
pinpoint
of
light
borne
by
the
bedouin
who
guides
you
hear
the
twitter
of
the
bats
that
have
their
dwelling
in
this
monstrous
gloom
that
man
has
made
to
shelter
the
thing
whose
ambition
could
never
be
embalmed
though
that
of
all
qualities
should
have
been
given
here
in
the
land
it
dowered
a
life
perpetual
now
you
know
the
great
pyramid
you
know
that
you
can
climb
it
that
you
can
enter
it
you
have
seen
it
from
all
sides
under
all
aspects
it
is
familiar
to
you
no
it
can
never
be
that
with
its
more
wonderful
comrade
the
sphinx
it
has
the
power
peculiar
so
it
seems
to
me
to
certain
of
the
rock
and
stone
monuments
of
egypt
of
holding
itself
ever
aloof
almost
like
the
soul
of
man
which
can
retreat
at
will
like
the
bedouin
retreating
from
you
into
the
blackness
of
the
pyramid
far
up
or
far
down
where
the
pursuing
stranger
unaided
can
not
follow
ii
the
sphinx
one
day
at
sunset
i
saw
a
bird
trying
to
play
with
the
sphinx
a
bird
like
a
swallow
but
with
a
ruddy
brown
on
its
breast
a
gleam
of
blue
somewhere
on
its
wings
when
i
came
to
the
edge
of
the
sand
basin
where
perhaps
khufu
saw
it
lying
nearly
four
thousand
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
the
sphinx
and
the
bird
were
quite
alone
the
bird
flew
near
the
sphinx
whimsically
turning
this
way
and
that
flying
now
low
now
high
but
ever
returning
to
the
magnet
which
drew
it
which
held
it
from
which
it
surely
longed
to
extract
some
sign
of
recognition
it
twittered
it
posed
itself
in
the
golden
air
with
its
bright
eyes
fixed
upon
those
eyes
of
stone
which
gazed
beyond
it
beyond
the
land
of
egypt
beyond
the
world
of
men
beyond
the
centre
of
the
sun
to
the
last
verges
of
eternity
and
presently
it
alighted
on
the
head
of
the
sphinx
then
on
its
ear
then
on
its
breast
and
over
the
breast
it
tripped
jerkily
with
tiny
elastic
steps
looking
upward
its
whole
body
quivering
apparently
with
a
desire
for
comprehension
a
desire
for
some
manifestation
of
friendship
then
suddenly
it
spread
its
wings
and
straight
as
an
arrow
it
flew
away
over
the
sands
and
the
waters
toward
the
and
cairo
and
the
sunset
waned
and
the
afterglow
flamed
and
faded
and
the
clear
soft
african
night
fell
the
pilgrims
who
day
by
day
visit
the
sphinx
like
the
bird
had
gone
back
to
cairo
they
had
come
as
the
bird
had
come
as
those
who
have
conquered
egypt
came
as
the
greeks
came
alexander
of
macedon
and
the
ptolemies
as
the
romans
came
as
the
mamelukes
the
turks
the
french
the
english
came
they
had
come
and
gone
and
that
enormous
face
with
the
stains
of
stormy
red
still
adhering
to
its
cheeks
grew
dark
as
the
darkness
closed
in
turned
brown
as
a
fellah
s
face
as
the
face
of
that
fellah
who
whispered
his
secret
in
the
sphinx
s
ear
but
learnt
no
secret
in
return
turned
black
almost
as
a
nubian
s
face
the
night
accentuated
its
appearance
of
terrible
repose
of
indifference
to
whatever
might
befall
in
the
night
i
seemed
to
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
dead
of
all
the
dead
warriors
and
the
steeds
they
rode
defiling
over
the
sand
before
the
unconquerable
thing
they
perhaps
thought
that
they
had
conquered
at
last
the
footsteps
died
away
there
was
a
silence
then
coming
down
from
the
great
pyramid
surely
i
heard
the
light
patter
of
a
donkey
s
feet
they
went
to
the
sphinx
and
ceased
the
silence
was
profound
and
i
remembered
the
legend
that
mary
joseph
and
the
holy
child
once
halted
here
on
their
long
journey
and
that
mary
laid
the
tired
christ
between
the
paws
of
the
sphinx
to
sleep
yet
even
of
the
christ
the
soul
within
that
body
could
take
no
heed
at
all
it
is
i
think
one
of
the
most
astounding
facts
in
the
history
of
man
that
a
man
was
able
to
contain
within
his
mind
to
conceive
the
conception
of
the
sphinx
that
he
could
carry
it
out
in
the
stone
is
amazing
but
how
much
more
amazing
it
is
that
before
there
was
the
sphinx
he
was
able
to
see
it
with
his
imagination
one
may
criticize
the
sphinx
one
may
say
impertinent
things
that
are
true
about
it
that
seen
from
behind
at
a
distance
its
head
looks
like
an
enormous
mushroom
growing
in
the
sand
that
its
cheeks
are
swelled
inordinately
that
its
mouth
is
legal
that
from
certain
places
it
bears
a
resemblance
to
a
prize
all
this
does
not
matter
at
all
what
does
matter
is
that
into
the
conception
and
execution
of
the
sphinx
has
been
poured
a
supreme
imaginative
power
he
who
created
it
looked
beyond
egypt
beyond
the
life
of
man
he
grasped
the
conception
of
eternity
and
realized
the
nothingness
of
time
and
he
rendered
it
in
stone
i
can
imagine
the
most
determined
atheist
looking
at
the
sphinx
and
in
a
flash
not
merely
believing
but
feeling
that
he
had
before
him
proof
of
the
life
of
the
soul
beyond
the
grave
of
the
life
of
the
soul
of
khufu
beyond
the
tomb
of
his
pyramid
always
as
you
return
to
the
sphinx
you
wonder
at
it
more
you
adore
more
strangely
its
repose
you
steep
yourself
more
intimately
in
the
aloof
peace
that
seems
to
emanate
from
it
as
light
emanates
from
the
sun
and
as
you
look
on
it
at
last
perhaps
you
understand
the
infinite
you
understand
where
is
the
bourne
to
which
the
finite
flows
with
all
its
greatness
as
the
great
nile
flows
from
beyond
victoria
nyanza
to
the
sea
and
as
the
wonder
of
the
sphinx
takes
possession
of
you
gradually
so
gradually
do
you
learn
to
feel
the
majesty
of
the
pyramids
of
ghizeh
unlike
the
step
pyramid
of
sakkara
which
even
when
one
is
near
it
looks
like
a
small
mountain
part
of
the
land
on
which
it
rests
the
pyramids
of
ghizeh
look
what
they
are
artificial
excrescences
invented
and
carried
out
by
man
expressions
of
man
s
greatness
exquisite
as
they
are
as
features
of
the
drowsy
golden
landscape
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
i
think
they
look
most
wonderful
at
night
when
they
are
black
beneath
the
stars
on
many
nights
i
have
sat
in
the
sand
at
a
distance
and
looked
at
them
and
always
and
increasingly
they
have
stirred
my
imagination
their
profound
calm
their
classical
simplicity
are
greatly
emphasized
when
no
detail
can
be
seen
when
they
are
but
black
shapes
towering
to
the
stars
they
seem
to
aspire
then
like
prayers
prayed
by
one
who
has
said
god
does
not
need
any
prayers
but
i
need
in
their
simplicity
they
suggest
a
crowd
of
thoughts
and
of
desires
guy
de
maupassant
has
said
that
of
all
the
arts
architecture
is
perhaps
the
most
aesthetic
the
most
mysterious
and
the
most
nourished
by
ideas
how
true
this
is
you
feel
as
you
look
at
the
great
pyramid
by
night
it
seems
to
breathe
out
mystery
the
immense
base
recalls
to
you
the
labyrinth
within
the
long
descent
from
the
tiny
slit
that
gives
you
entrance
your
uncertain
steps
in
its
hot
eternal
night
your
falls
on
the
surfaces
of
its
polished
blocks
of
stone
the
crushing
weight
that
seemed
to
lie
on
your
heart
as
you
stole
uncertainly
on
summoned
almost
as
by
the
desert
your
sensation
of
being
for
ever
imprisoned
taken
and
hidden
by
a
monster
from
egypt
s
wonderful
light
as
you
stood
in
the
central
chamber
and
realized
the
stone
ocean
into
whose
depths
like
some
intrepid
diver
you
had
dared
deliberately
to
come
and
then
your
eyes
travel
up
the
slowly
shrinking
walls
till
they
reach
the
dark
point
which
is
the
top
there
you
stood
with
abou
who
spends
half
his
life
on
the
highest
stone
hostages
of
the
sun
bathed
in
light
and
air
that
perhaps
came
to
you
from
the
gold
coast
and
you
saw
men
and
camels
like
flies
and
cairo
like
a
grey
blur
and
the
mokattam
hills
almost
as
a
higher
ridge
of
the
sands
the
mosque
of
mohammed
ali
was
like
a
cup
turned
over
far
below
slept
the
dead
in
that
graveyard
of
the
sphinx
with
its
pale
stones
its
sand
its
palm
its
sycamores
of
the
south
once
worshipped
and
regarded
as
hathor
s
living
body
and
beyond
them
on
one
side
were
the
sleeping
waters
with
islands
small
surely
as
delicate
egyptian
hands
and
on
the
other
the
great
desert
that
stretches
so
the
bedouins
say
on
and
on
for
a
march
of
a
thousand
that
base
and
that
summit
what
suggestion
and
what
mystery
in
their
contrast
what
sober
eternal
beauty
in
the
dark
line
which
unites
them
now
sharply
yet
softly
defined
against
the
night
which
is
purple
as
the
one
garment
of
the
fellah
that
line
leads
the
soul
irresistibly
from
earth
to
the
stars
iii
sakkara
it
was
the
little
christmas
of
the
egyptians
as
i
rode
to
sakkara
after
seeing
a
wonderful
feat
the
ascent
and
descent
of
the
second
pyramid
in
nineteen
minutes
by
a
young
bedouin
called
mohammed
ali
who
very
seriously
informed
me
that
the
only
roumi
who
had
ever
reached
the
top
was
an
american
gentlemens
called
mark
twain
on
his
first
visit
to
egypt
on
his
second
visit
ali
said
mr
twain
had
a
bad
foot
and
declared
he
could
not
be
bothered
with
the
second
pyramid
he
had
been
up
and
down
without
a
guide
he
had
disturbed
the
jackal
which
lives
near
its
summit
and
which
i
saw
running
in
the
sunshine
as
ali
drew
near
its
lair
and
he
was
satisfied
to
rest
on
his
immortal
laurels
to
the
bedouins
of
the
pyramids
mark
twain
s
celebrity
is
owing
to
one
fact
alone
he
is
the
only
roumi
who
has
climbed
the
second
pyramid
that
is
why
his
name
is
known
to
every
one
it
was
the
little
christmas
and
from
the
villages
in
the
plain
the
egyptians
came
pouring
out
to
visit
their
dead
in
the
desert
cemeteries
as
i
passed
by
to
visit
the
dead
in
the
tombs
far
off
on
the
horizon
women
swathed
in
black
gathered
in
groups
and
jumped
monotonously
up
and
down
to
the
accompaniment
of
stained
hands
clapping
and
strange
and
weary
songs
tiny
children
blew
furiously
into
tin
trumpets
emitting
sounds
that
were
terribly
european
men
strode
seriously
by
or
stood
in
knots
among
the
graves
talking
vivaciously
of
the
things
of
this
life
as
the
sun
rose
higher
in
the
heavens
this
visit
to
the
dead
became
a
carnival
of
the
living
laughter
and
shrill
cries
of
merriment
betokened
the
resignation
of
the
mourners
the
were
black
with
running
figures
racing
leaping
chasing
one
another
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
warm
and
golden
grains
some
sat
among
the
graves
and
ate
some
sang
some
danced
i
saw
no
one
praying
after
the
sun
was
up
the
great
pyramid
of
ghizeh
was
transformed
in
this
morning
hour
and
gleamed
like
a
marble
mountain
or
like
the
hill
covered
with
salt
at
in
algeria
as
we
went
on
it
sank
down
into
the
sands
until
at
last
i
could
see
only
a
small
section
with
its
top
which
looked
almost
as
pointed
as
a
gigantic
needle
abou
was
there
on
the
hot
stones
in
the
golden
eye
of
the
sun
abou
who
lives
to
respect
his
pyramid
and
to
serve
turkish
coffee
to
those
who
are
determined
enough
to
climb
it
before
me
the
step
pyramid
rose
brown
almost
as
bronze
out
of
the
sands
here
desolate
and
pallid
soon
i
was
in
the
house
of
marriette
between
the
little
sphinxes
near
cairo
although
the
desert
is
real
desert
it
does
not
give
to
me
at
any
rate
the
immense
impression
of
naked
sterility
of
almost
brassy
fierceness
which
often
strikes
one
in
the
sahara
to
the
south
of
algeria
where
at
midday
one
sometimes
has
a
feeling
of
being
lost
upon
a
waste
of
metal
gleaming
angry
tigerish
in
color
here
in
egypt
both
the
people
and
the
desert
seem
gentler
safer
more
amiable
yet
these
tombs
of
sakkara
are
hidden
in
a
desolation
of
the
sands
peculiarly
blanched
and
mournful
and
as
you
wander
from
tomb
to
tomb
descending
and
ascending
stealing
through
great
galleries
beneath
the
sands
creeping
through
tubes
of
stone
crouching
almost
on
hands
and
knees
in
the
sultry
chambers
of
the
dead
the
awfulness
of
the
passing
away
of
dynasties
and
of
race
comes
like
a
cloud
upon
your
spirit
but
this
cloud
lifts
and
floats
from
you
in
the
cheerful
tomb
of
thi
that
royal
councillor
that
scribe
and
confidant
whose
life
must
have
been
passed
in
a
round
of
serene
activities
amid
a
sneering
though
doubtless
admiring
population
into
this
tomb
of
white
vivacious
figures
gay
almost
though
never
wholly
frivolous
for
these
men
were
full
of
purpose
full
of
an
ardor
that
seduces
even
where
it
seems
grotesque
i
took
with
me
a
child
of
ten
called
ali
from
the
village
of
kafiah
and
as
i
looked
from
him
to
the
walls
around
us
rather
than
the
passing
away
of
the
races
i
realized
the
persistence
of
type
for
everywhere
i
saw
the
face
of
little
ali
with
every
feature
exactly
reproduced
here
he
was
bending
over
a
sacrifice
leading
a
sacred
bull
feeding
geese
from
a
cup
roasting
a
chicken
pulling
a
boat
carpentering
polishing
conducting
a
monkey
for
a
walk
or
merely
sitting
bolt
upright
and
sneering
there
were
lines
of
little
alis
with
their
hands
held
to
their
breasts
their
faces
in
profile
their
knees
rigid
in
the
happy
tomb
of
thi
but
he
glanced
at
them
unheeding
did
not
recognize
his
ancestors
and
he
did
not
care
to
penetrate
into
the
tombs
of
mera
and
into
the
serapeum
and
the
mestaba
of
perhaps
he
was
right
the
serapeum
is
grand
in
its
vastness
with
its
long
and
high
galleries
and
its
mighty
vaults
containing
the
huge
granite
sarcophagi
of
the
sacred
bulls
of
apis
mera
red
and
white
welcomes
you
from
an
elevated
niche
benignly
priest
of
the
fifth
dynasty
receives
you
seated
at
a
table
that
resembles
a
rake
with
long
yellow
teeth
standing
on
its
handle
and
drinking
stiffly
a
cup
of
wine
you
see
upon
the
wall
near
by
with
sympathy
a
patient
being
plied
by
a
naked
and
evidently
an
unyielding
physician
with
medicine
from
a
jar
that
might
have
been
visited
by
morgiana
a
musician
playing
upon
an
instrument
like
a
huge
and
stringless
harp
but
it
is
the
happy
tomb
of
thi
that
lingers
in
your
memory
in
that
tomb
one
sees
proclaimed
with
a
marvellous
ingenuity
and
expressiveness
the
joy
and
the
activity
of
life
thi
must
have
loved
life
loved
prayer
and
sacrifice
loved
sport
and
war
loved
feasting
and
gaiety
labor
of
the
hands
and
of
the
head
loved
the
arts
the
music
of
flute
and
harp
singing
by
the
lingering
and
plaintive
voices
which
seem
to
express
the
essence
of
the
east
loved
sweet
odors
loved
sweet
women
do
we
not
see
him
sitting
to
receive
offerings
with
his
wife
beside
him
loved
the
clear
nights
and
the
radiant
days
that
in
egypt
make
glad
the
heart
of
man
he
must
have
loved
the
splendid
gift
of
life
and
used
it
completely
and
so
little
ali
had
very
right
to
make
his
sole
obeisance
at
thi
s
delicious
tomb
from
which
death
itself
seems
banished
by
the
soft
and
embracing
radiance
of
the
almost
living
walls
this
delicate
cheerfulness
a
quite
airy
gaiety
of
life
is
often
combined
in
egypt
and
most
beautifully
and
happily
combined
with
tremendous
solidity
heavy
impressiveness
a
hugeness
that
is
tragic
and
it
supplies
a
relief
to
eye
to
mind
to
soul
that
is
sweet
and
refreshing
as
the
trickle
of
a
tarantella
from
a
reed
flute
heard
under
the
shadows
of
a
temple
of
hercules
life
showers
us
with
contrasts
art
which
gives
to
us
a
second
and
a
more
withdrawn
life
opening
to
us
a
door
through
which
we
pass
to
our
dreams
may
well
imitate
life
in
this
iv
abydos
through
a
long
and
golden
noontide
and
on
into
an
afternoon
whose
opulence
of
warmth
and
light
it
seemed
could
never
wane
i
sat
alone
or
wandered
gently
quite
alone
in
the
temple
of
seti
at
abydos
here
again
i
was
in
a
place
of
the
dead
in
egypt
one
ever
seeks
the
dead
in
the
sunshine
black
vaults
in
the
land
of
the
gold
but
here
in
abydos
i
was
accompanied
by
whiteness
the
general
effect
of
seti
s
mighty
temple
is
that
it
is
a
white
temple
when
seen
in
full
sunshine
and
beneath
a
sky
of
blinding
blue
in
an
arid
place
it
stands
just
beyond
an
egyptian
village
that
is
a
maze
of
dust
of
children
of
animals
and
flies
the
last
blind
houses
of
the
village
brown
as
brown
paper
confront
it
on
a
mound
and
as
i
came
toward
it
a
swathed
in
purple
with
and
a
twist
of
orange
handkerchief
above
her
eyes
full
of
cloud
and
fire
leaned
from
a
roof
sinuously
as
a
young
snake
to
watch
me
on
each
side
descending
were
white
ruined
walls
stretched
out
like
defaced
white
arms
of
the
temple
to
receive
me
i
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
the
narrow
severely
simple
doorway
at
the
twelve
broken
columns
advanced
on
either
side
white
and
greyish
white
with
their
right
angles
their
once
painted
figures
now
almost
wholly
colorless
here
lay
the
osirians
those
blessed
dead
of
the
land
of
egypt
who
worshipped
the
judge
of
the
dead
the
lord
of
the
underworld
and
who
hoped
for
immortality
through
him
osiris
husband
of
isis
osiris
receiver
of
prayers
osiris
the
sun
who
will
not
be
conquered
by
night
but
eternally
rises
again
and
so
is
the
symbol
of
the
resurrection
of
the
soul
it
is
said
that
set
the
power
of
evil
tore
the
body
of
osiris
into
fourteen
fragments
and
scattered
them
over
the
land
but
multitudes
of
worshippers
of
osiris
believed
him
buried
near
abydos
and
like
those
who
loved
the
sweet
songs
of
hafiz
they
desired
to
be
buried
near
him
whom
they
adored
and
so
this
place
became
a
place
of
the
dead
a
place
of
many
prayers
a
white
place
of
many
longings
i
was
glad
to
be
alone
there
the
guardian
left
me
in
perfect
peace
i
happily
forgot
him
i
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
column
upon
its
mighty
projecting
base
the
sky
was
blinding
blue
great
bees
hummed
like
bourdons
through
the
silence
deepening
the
almost
heavy
calm
these
columns
architraves
doorways
how
mighty
how
grandly
strong
they
were
and
yet
soon
i
began
to
be
aware
that
even
here
where
surely
one
should
read
only
the
book
of
the
dead
or
bend
down
to
the
hot
ground
to
listen
if
perchance
one
might
hear
the
dead
themselves
murmuring
over
the
chapters
of
beatification
far
down
in
their
hidden
tombs
there
was
a
likeness
a
gentle
gaiety
of
life
as
in
the
tomb
of
thi
the
effect
of
solidity
was
immense
these
columns
bulged
almost
like
great
fruits
swollen
out
by
their
heady
strength
of
blood
they
towered
up
in
crowds
the
heavy
roof
broken
in
places
most
mercifully
to
show
squares
and
oblongs
of
that
perfect
calling
blue
was
like
a
frowning
brow
and
yet
i
was
with
grace
with
gentleness
with
lightness
because
in
the
place
of
the
dead
i
was
again
with
the
happy
living
walls
above
me
on
the
roof
there
was
a
gleam
of
palest
blue
like
the
blue
i
have
sometimes
seen
at
morning
on
the
ionian
sea
just
where
it
meets
the
shore
the
double
rows
of
gigantic
columns
stretched
away
tall
almost
as
forest
trees
to
right
of
me
and
to
left
and
were
shut
in
by
massive
walls
strong
as
the
walls
of
a
fortress
and
on
these
columns
and
on
these
walls
dead
painters
and
gravers
had
breathed
the
sweet
breath
of
life
here
in
the
sun
for
me
alone
as
it
seemed
a
population
followed
their
occupations
men
walked
and
kneeled
and
stood
some
white
and
clothed
some
nude
some
red
as
the
red
man
s
child
that
leaped
beyond
the
sea
and
here
was
the
held
in
reverent
hands
not
the
but
the
blossom
that
typified
the
rising
again
of
the
sun
and
that
worn
as
an
amulet
signified
the
gift
of
eternal
youth
and
here
was
horus
and
here
a
priest
offering
sacrifice
to
a
god
belief
in
whom
has
long
since
passed
away
a
king
revealed
himself
to
me
adoring
ptah
father
of
the
beginnings
who
established
upon
earth
my
figures
thought
the
everlasting
justice
and
again
at
the
knees
of
amen
burning
incense
in
his
honor
isis
and
osiris
stood
together
and
sacrifice
was
made
before
their
sacred
bark
and
seti
worshipped
them
and
seshta
goddess
of
learning
wrote
in
the
book
of
eternity
the
name
of
the
king
the
great
bees
hummed
moving
slowly
in
the
golden
air
among
the
mighty
columns
passing
slowly
among
these
records
of
lives
long
over
but
which
seemed
still
to
be
and
i
looked
at
the
which
the
little
grotesque
hands
were
holding
had
been
holding
for
how
many
years
the
flowers
that
typified
the
rising
again
of
the
sun
and
the
divine
gift
of
eternal
youth
and
i
thought
of
the
bird
and
the
sphinx
the
thing
that
was
whimsical
wooing
the
thing
that
was
mighty
and
i
gazed
at
the
immense
columns
and
at
the
light
and
little
figures
all
about
me
bird
and
sphinx
delicate
whimsicality
calm
and
terrific
power
in
egypt
the
dead
men
have
combined
them
and
the
combination
has
an
irresistible
fascination
weaves
a
spell
that
entrances
you
in
the
sunshine
and
beneath
the
blinding
blue
at
abydos
i
knew
it
and
i
loved
the
columns
that
seemed
blown
out
with
exuberant
strength
and
i
loved
the
delicate
white
walls
that
like
the
give
to
the
world
a
youth
that
seems
eternal
a
youth
that
is
never
frivolous
but
that
is
full
of
the
divine
and
yet
pathetic
animation
of
happy
life
the
great
bees
hummed
more
drowsily
i
sat
quite
still
in
the
sun
and
then
presently
moved
by
some
prompting
instinct
i
turned
my
head
and
far
off
through
the
narrow
portal
of
the
temple
i
saw
the
swathed
in
purple
still
lying
sinuously
as
a
young
snake
upon
the
roof
above
the
brown
earth
wall
to
watch
me
with
her
eyes
of
cloud
and
fire
and
upon
me
like
cloud
and
fire
cloud
of
the
tombs
and
the
great
temple
columns
fire
of
the
brilliant
life
painted
and
engraved
upon
them
there
stole
the
spell
of
egypt
v
the
nile
i
do
not
find
in
egypt
any
more
the
strangeness
that
once
amazed
and
at
first
almost
bewildered
me
stranger
by
far
is
morocco
stranger
the
country
beyond
biskra
near
mogar
round
touggourt
even
about
el
kantara
there
i
feel
very
far
away
as
a
child
feels
distance
from
dear
familiar
things
i
look
to
the
horizon
expectant
of
i
know
not
what
magical
occurrences
what
mysteries
i
am
aware
of
the
summons
to
advance
to
marvellous
lands
where
marvellous
things
must
happen
i
am
taken
by
that
sensation
of
almost
trembling
magic
which
came
to
me
when
first
i
saw
a
mirage
far
out
in
the
sahara
but
egypt
though
it
contains
so
many
marvels
has
no
longer
for
me
the
marvellous
atmosphere
its
keynote
is
seductiveness
in
egypt
one
feels
very
safe
smiling
policemen
in
clothes
of
spotless
white
emblematic
surely
of
their
innocence
seem
to
be
everywhere
standing
calmly
in
the
sun
very
gentle
very
tender
although
perhaps
not
very
true
are
the
bedouins
at
the
pyramids
up
the
nile
the
fellaheen
smile
as
kindly
as
the
policemen
smile
protectingly
upon
you
as
if
they
would
say
allah
has
placed
us
here
to
take
care
of
the
confiding
no
ferocious
demands
for
money
fall
upon
my
ears
only
an
occasional
suggestion
is
subtly
conveyed
to
me
that
even
the
poor
must
live
and
that
i
am
immensely
rich
an
amiable
an
almost
enticing
seductiveness
seems
emanating
from
the
fertile
soil
shining
in
the
golden
air
gleaming
softly
in
the
amber
sands
dimpling
in
the
brown
the
mauve
the
silver
eddies
of
the
nile
it
steals
upon
one
it
ripples
over
one
it
laps
one
as
if
with
warm
and
scented
waves
a
sort
of
lustrous
languor
overtakes
one
in
physical
one
sinks
down
and
with
wide
eyes
one
gazes
and
listens
and
enjoys
and
thinks
not
of
the
morrow
the
dahabiyeh
her
very
name
the
has
a
gentle
seductive
cooing
sound
drifts
broadside
to
the
current
with
furled
sails
or
glides
smoothly
on
before
an
amiable
north
wind
with
sails
unfurled
upon
the
bloomy
banks
rich
brown
in
color
the
brown
men
stoop
and
straighten
themselves
and
stoop
again
and
sing
the
sun
gleams
on
their
copper
skins
which
look
polished
and
metallic
crouched
in
his
net
behind
the
drowsy
oxen
the
little
boy
circles
the
livelong
day
with
the
sakieh
and
the
sakieh
raises
its
wailing
wayward
voice
and
sings
to
the
shadoof
and
the
shadoof
sings
to
the
sakieh
and
the
lifted
water
falls
and
flows
away
into
the
green
wilderness
of
doura
that
like
a
miniature
forest
spreads
on
every
hand
to
the
low
mountains
which
do
not
perturb
the
spirit
as
do
the
iron
mountains
of
algeria
and
always
the
sun
is
shining
and
the
body
is
drinking
in
its
warmth
and
the
soul
is
drinking
in
its
gold
and
always
the
ears
are
full
of
warm
and
drowsy
and
monotonous
music
and
always
the
eyes
see
the
lines
of
brown
bodies
on
the
brown
above
the
brown
waters
bending
straightening
bending
straightening
with
an
exquisitely
precise
monotony
and
always
the
seems
to
be
drifting
so
quietly
she
slips
up
or
down
the
level
waterway
and
one
drifts
too
one
can
but
drift
happily
sleepily
forgetting
every
care
from
abydos
to
denderah
one
drifts
and
from
denderah
to
karnak
to
luxor
to
all
the
marvels
on
the
western
shore
and
on
to
edfu
to
kom
ombos
to
assuan
and
perhaps
even
into
nubia
to
and
to
life
on
the
nile
is
a
long
dream
golden
and
sweet
as
honey
of
hymettus
for
i
let
the
divine
serpent
who
at
philae
may
be
seen
issuing
from
her
charmed
cavern
take
me
very
quietly
to
see
the
abodes
of
the
dead
the
halls
of
the
vanished
upon
her
green
and
sterile
shores
i
know
nothing
of
the
bustling
shrieking
steamer
that
defies
her
churning
into
angry
waves
her
waters
for
the
edification
of
those
who
would
do
egypt
and
be
gone
before
they
know
her
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
do
not
come
to
egypt
to
hurry
in
egypt
is
as
wrong
as
to
fall
asleep
in
wall
street
or
to
sit
in
the
greek
theatre
at
taormina
reading
how
to
make
a
fortune
with
a
capital
of
fifty
vi
denderah
from
abydos
home
of
the
cult
of
osiris
judge
of
the
dead
i
came
to
denderah
the
great
temple
of
the
lady
of
the
underworld
as
the
goddess
hathor
was
sometimes
called
though
she
was
usually
worshipped
as
the
egyptian
aphrodite
goddess
of
joy
goddess
of
love
and
loveliness
it
was
early
morning
when
i
went
ashore
the
sun
was
above
the
eastern
hills
and
a
boy
clad
in
a
rope
of
plaited
grass
sent
me
half
shyly
the
greeting
may
your
day
be
happy
youth
is
perhaps
the
most
divine
of
all
the
gifts
of
the
gods
as
those
who
wore
the
amulet
believed
thousands
of
years
ago
and
denderah
appropriately
is
a
very
young
egyptian
temple
probably
indeed
the
youngest
of
all
the
temples
on
the
nile
its
youthfulness
it
is
only
about
two
thousand
years
of
age
identifies
it
happily
with
the
happiness
and
beauty
of
its
presiding
deity
and
as
i
rode
toward
it
on
the
in
the
young
freshness
of
the
morning
i
thought
of
the
goddess
safekh
and
of
the
sacred
when
safekh
inscribed
upon
a
leaf
of
the
the
name
of
king
or
conqueror
he
gained
everlasting
life
was
it
the
life
of
youth
an
everlasting
life
of
middle
age
might
be
a
doubtful
benefit
and
then
mentally
i
added
unless
one
lived
in
for
here
the
years
drop
from
one
and
every
golden
hour
brings
to
one
surely
another
drop
of
the
wondrous
essence
that
sets
time
at
defiance
and
charms
sad
thoughts
away
unlike
white
abydos
white
denderah
stands
apart
from
habitations
in
a
still
solitude
upon
a
blackened
mound
from
far
off
i
saw
the
façade
large
bare
and
sober
rising
in
a
nakedness
as
complete
as
that
of
aphrodite
rising
from
the
wave
out
of
the
plain
of
brown
alluvial
soil
that
was
broken
here
and
there
by
a
sharp
green
of
growing
things
there
was
something
of
sadness
in
the
scene
and
again
i
thought
of
hathor
as
the
lady
of
the
underworld
some
being
with
a
pale
brow
hair
like
the
night
and
yearning
wistful
hands
stretched
out
in
supplication
there
was
a
hush
upon
this
place
the
loud
and
vehement
cry
of
the
died
away
the
sakieh
droned
in
my
ears
no
more
like
distant
sicilian
pipes
playing
at
natale
i
felt
a
breath
from
the
desert
and
indeed
the
desert
was
near
that
realistic
desert
which
suggests
to
the
traveller
approaches
to
the
sea
so
that
beyond
each
pallid
dune
as
he
draws
near
it
he
half
expects
to
hear
the
lapping
of
the
waves
presently
when
having
ascended
that
marvellous
staircase
of
the
new
year
walking
in
procession
with
the
priests
upon
its
walls
toward
the
rays
of
ra
i
came
out
upon
the
temple
roof
and
looked
upon
the
desert
upon
sheeny
sands
almost
like
slopes
of
satin
shining
in
the
sun
upon
paler
sands
in
the
distance
holding
an
arab
in
which
rose
the
little
creamy
cupolas
of
a
sheikh
s
tomb
surrounded
by
a
creamy
wall
those
little
cupolas
gave
to
me
a
feeling
of
the
real
the
irresistible
africa
such
as
i
had
not
known
since
i
had
been
in
egypt
and
i
thought
i
heard
in
the
distance
the
ceaseless
hum
of
praying
and
praising
voices
god
hath
rewarded
the
faithful
with
gardens
through
which
flow
rivulets
they
shall
be
for
ever
therein
and
that
is
the
reward
of
the
the
sensation
of
solemnity
which
overtook
me
as
i
approached
the
temple
deepened
when
i
drew
close
to
it
when
i
stood
within
it
in
the
first
hall
mighty
magnificent
full
of
enormous
columns
from
which
faces
of
hathor
once
looked
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
i
found
only
one
face
almost
complete
saved
from
the
fury
of
fanatics
by
the
protection
of
the
goddess
of
chance
in
whom
the
modern
egyptian
so
implicitly
believes
in
shape
it
was
a
delicate
oval
in
the
long
eyes
about
the
brow
the
cheeks
there
was
a
strained
expression
that
suggested
to
me
more
than
a
gravity
almost
an
anguish
of
spirit
as
i
looked
at
it
i
thought
of
eleanora
duse
was
this
the
ideal
of
joy
in
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
joy
may
be
rapturous
or
it
may
be
serene
but
could
it
ever
be
like
this
the
pale
delicious
blue
that
here
and
there
in
tiny
sections
broke
the
almost
haggard
greyish
whiteness
of
this
first
hall
with
the
roof
of
black
like
bits
of
an
evening
sky
seen
through
tiny
in
a
sombre
room
suggested
joy
was
joy
summed
up
in
color
but
hathor
s
face
was
weariful
and
sad
from
the
gloom
of
the
inner
halls
came
a
sound
loud
angry
menacing
as
i
walked
on
a
sound
of
menace
and
an
odor
heavy
and
deathlike
only
in
the
first
hall
had
those
builders
and
decorators
of
two
thousand
years
ago
been
moved
by
their
conception
of
the
goddess
to
hail
her
to
worship
her
with
the
purity
of
white
with
the
sweet
gaiety
of
turquoise
or
so
it
seems
when
the
passion
of
christianity
against
hathor
has
spent
itself
and
died
now
christians
come
to
seek
what
christian
copts
destroyed
wander
through
the
deserted
courts
desirous
of
looking
upon
the
faces
that
have
long
since
been
hacked
to
pieces
a
more
benign
spirit
informs
our
world
but
alas
hathor
has
been
sacrificed
to
deviltries
of
old
and
it
is
well
perhaps
that
her
temple
should
be
sad
like
a
place
of
silent
waiting
for
the
glories
that
are
gone
with
every
step
my
melancholy
grew
encompassed
by
gloomy
odors
assailed
by
the
clamour
of
gigantic
bats
which
flew
furiously
among
the
monstrous
pillars
near
a
roof
ominous
as
a
my
spirit
was
haunted
by
the
sad
eyes
of
hathor
which
gaze
for
ever
from
that
column
in
the
first
hall
were
they
always
like
that
once
that
face
dwelt
with
a
crowd
of
worship
and
all
the
other
faces
have
gone
and
all
the
glory
has
passed
and
like
so
many
of
the
living
the
goddess
has
paid
for
her
splendors
the
pendulum
swung
and
where
men
adored
men
hated
her
her
the
goddess
of
love
and
loveliness
and
as
the
human
face
changes
when
terror
and
sorrow
come
i
felt
as
if
hathor
s
face
of
stone
had
changed
upon
its
column
looking
toward
the
nile
in
obedience
to
the
anguish
in
her
heart
i
felt
as
if
denderah
were
a
majestic
house
of
grief
so
i
must
always
think
of
it
dark
tragic
and
superb
the
egyptians
once
believed
that
when
death
came
to
a
man
the
soul
of
him
which
they
called
the
ba
winged
its
way
to
the
gods
but
that
moved
by
a
sweet
unselfishness
it
returned
sometimes
to
his
tomb
to
give
comfort
to
the
poor
deserted
mummy
upon
the
lids
of
sarcophagi
it
is
sometimes
represented
as
a
bird
flying
down
to
or
resting
upon
the
mummy
as
i
went
onward
in
the
darkness
among
the
columns
over
the
blocks
of
stone
that
form
the
pavements
seeing
vaguely
the
sacred
boats
upon
the
walls
horus
and
thoth
the
king
before
osiris
as
i
mounted
and
descended
with
the
priests
to
roof
and
floor
i
longed
instead
of
the
clamour
of
the
bats
to
hear
the
light
flutter
of
the
soft
wings
of
the
ba
of
hathor
flying
from
paradise
to
this
sad
temple
of
the
desert
to
bring
her
comfort
in
the
gloom
i
thought
of
her
as
a
poor
woman
suffering
as
only
women
can
in
loneliness
in
the
museum
of
cairo
there
is
the
mummy
of
the
lady
amanit
priestess
of
she
lies
there
upon
her
back
with
her
thin
body
slightly
turned
toward
the
left
side
as
if
in
an
effort
to
change
her
position
her
head
is
completely
turned
to
the
same
side
her
mouth
is
wide
open
showing
all
the
teeth
the
tongue
is
lolling
out
upon
the
head
the
thin
brown
hair
makes
a
line
above
the
little
ear
and
is
mingled
at
the
back
of
the
head
with
false
tresses
round
the
neck
is
a
mass
of
ornaments
of
amulets
and
beads
the
right
arm
and
hand
lie
along
the
body
the
expression
of
the
lady
amanit
is
very
strange
and
very
subtle
for
it
combines
horror
which
implies
activity
with
a
profound
an
impenetrable
repose
far
beyond
the
reach
of
all
disturbance
in
the
temple
of
denderah
i
fancied
the
lady
amanit
ministering
sadly
even
terribly
to
a
lonely
goddess
moving
in
fear
through
an
eternal
gloom
dying
at
last
there
overwhelmed
by
tasks
too
heavy
for
that
tiny
body
the
spirit
that
inhabited
it
and
now
she
sleeps
one
feels
that
as
one
gazes
at
the
mummy
very
profoundly
though
not
yet
very
calmly
the
lady
amanit
but
her
goddess
still
she
wakes
upon
her
column
when
i
came
out
at
last
into
the
sunlight
of
the
growing
day
i
circled
the
temple
skirting
its
gigantic
corniced
walls
from
which
at
intervals
the
heads
and
paws
of
resting
lions
protrude
to
see
another
woman
whose
fame
for
loveliness
and
seduction
is
almost
as
legendary
as
aphrodite
s
it
is
fitting
enough
that
cleopatra
s
form
should
be
graven
upon
the
temple
of
hathor
fitting
also
that
though
i
found
her
in
the
presence
of
deities
and
in
the
company
of
her
son
caesarion
her
face
which
is
in
profile
should
have
nothing
of
hathor
s
sad
impressiveness
this
no
doubt
is
not
the
real
cleopatra
nevertheless
this
face
suggests
a
certain
cruelty
and
sensuality
essentially
human
and
utterly
detached
from
all
divinity
whereas
in
the
face
of
the
goddess
there
is
a
something
remote
and
even
distantly
intellectual
which
calls
the
imagination
to
the
fields
as
i
rode
back
toward
the
river
i
saw
again
the
boy
clad
in
the
rope
of
plaited
grass
and
again
he
said
less
shyly
may
your
day
be
happy
it
was
a
kindly
wish
in
the
dawn
i
had
felt
it
to
be
almost
a
prophecy
but
now
i
was
haunted
by
the
face
of
the
goddess
of
denderah
and
i
remembered
the
legend
of
the
lovely
lais
who
when
she
began
to
age
covered
herself
from
the
eyes
of
men
with
a
veil
and
went
every
day
at
evening
to
look
upon
her
statue
in
which
the
genius
of
praxiteles
had
rendered
permanent
the
beauty
the
woman
could
not
keep
one
evening
hanging
to
the
statue
s
pedestal
by
a
garland
of
red
roses
the
sculptor
found
a
mirror
upon
the
polished
disk
of
which
were
traced
these
words
lais
o
goddess
consecrates
to
thee
her
mirror
no
longer
able
to
see
there
what
she
was
she
will
not
see
there
what
she
has
my
hathor
of
denderah
the
dweller
on
the
column
in
the
first
hall
had
she
a
mirror
would
surely
hang
it
as
lais
hung
hers
at
the
foot
of
the
pedestal
of
the
egyptian
aphrodite
had
she
a
veil
would
surely
cover
the
face
that
solitary
among
the
cruel
evidences
of
christian
ferocity
silently
says
to
the
gloomy
courts
to
the
shining
desert
and
the
nile
once
i
was
worshipped
but
i
am
worshipped

in

with

with
luxor
beneath
the
little
tapering
minaret
whence
the
call
to
prayer
drops
down
to
be
answered
by
the
angelus
bell
falls
into
a
reverie
in

thinking
place
of

to

the
mightiest
of

carried
into
a
realm
of
delicate
magic
where
engineers
are
not
each
prompts
him
to
a
different
mood
each
wakes
in
his
nature
a
different
response
and
at
karnak
what

him
there
is

sad

or

an
old
lady
in
a
helmet
and
other
things
considered
no
doubt
by
her
as
suited
to
egypt
rather
than
to
herself
remarked
in
my
hearing
with
a
scotch
accent
and
an
air
of
summing
up
that
karnak
was
very
nice
there
she
was
wrong
scotch
and
wrong
karnak
is
not
nice
no
temple
that
i
have
seen
upon
the
banks
of
the
nile
is
nice
and
karnak
can
not
be
summed
up
in
a
phrase
or
in
many
phrases
can
not
even
be
adequately
described
in
few
or
many
words
long
ago
i
saw
it
lighted
up
with
colored
fires
one
night
for
the
khedive
its
ravaged
magnificence
tinted
with
rose
and
livid
green
and
blue
its
pylons
glittering
with
artificial
gold
its
population
of
statues
its
obelisks
and
columns
changing
from
things
of
dreams
to
things
of
day
from
twilight
marvels
to
shadowy
specters
and
from
these
to
hard
and
piercing
realities
at
the
cruel
will
of
pigmies
crouching
by
its
walls
now
after
many
years
i
saw
it
first
quietly
by
moonlight
after
watching
the
sunset
from
the
summit
of
the
great
pylon
that
was
a
pageant
worth
more
than
the
khedive
s
i
was
in
the
air
had
something
of
the
released
feeling
i
have
often
known
upon
the
tower
of
biskra
looking
out
toward
evening
to
the
sahara
spaces
but
here
i
was
not
confronted
with
an
immensity
of
nature
but
with
a
gleaming
river
and
an
immensity
of
man
beneath
me
was
the
native
village
in
the
heart
of
daylight
dusty
and
unkempt
but
now
becoming
charged
with
velvety
beauty
with
the
soft
and
heavy
mystery
that
at
evening
is
born
among
great
along
the
path
that
led
from
it
coming
toward
the
avenue
of
sphinxes
with
ram
that
watch
for
ever
before
the
temple
door
a
great
white
camel
stepped
its
rider
a
tiny
child
with
a
close
white
cap
upon
his
head
the
child
was
singing
to
the
glory
of
the
sunset
or
was
it
to
the
glory
of
amun
the
hidden
one
once
the
local
god
of
thebes
to
whom
the
grandest
temple
in
the
world
was
dedicated
i
listen
to
the
childish
quavering
voice
twittering
almost
like
a
bird
and
one
word
alone
came
up
to
me
the
word
one
hears
in
egypt
from
all
the
lips
that
speak
and
sing
from
the
nubians
round
their
fires
at
night
from
the
little
boatmen
of
the
lower
reaches
of
the
nile
from
the
bedouins
of
the
desert
and
the
donkey
boys
of
the
villages
from
the
sheikh
who
reads
one
s
future
in
water
spilt
on
a
plate
and
the
bisharin
with
buttered
curls
who
runs
to
sell
one
beads
from
his
tent
among
the
allah
the
child
was
singing
as
he
passed
upon
his
way
pigeons
circled
above
their
pretty
towers
the
bats
came
out
as
if
they
knew
how
precious
is
their
black
at
evening
against
the
ethereal
lemon
color
the
orange
and
the
red
the
little
obelisk
beyond
the
last
sphinx
on
the
left
began
to
change
as
in
egypt
all
things
change
at
sunset
pylon
and
dusty
bush
colossus
and
baked
earth
hovel
sycamore
and
tamarisk
statue
and
trotting
donkey
it
looked
like
a
mysterious
finger
pointed
in
warning
toward
the
sky
the
nile
began
to
gleam
upon
its
steel
and
silver
torches
of
amber
flame
were
lighted
the
libyan
mountains
became
spectral
beyond
the
tombs
of
the
kings
the
tiny
rough
cupolas
that
mark
a
grave
close
to
the
sphinxes
in
daytime
dingy
and
poor
now
seemed
made
of
some
splendid
material
worthy
to
roof
the
mummy
of
a
king
far
off
a
pool
of
the
nile
that
from
here
looked
like
a
little
lake
turned
the
flags
from
the
standard
of
luxor
among
the
minarets
flew
out
straight
against
a
sky
that
was
pale
as
a
primrose
almost
cold
in
its
amazing
delicacy
i
turned
and
behind
me
the
moon
was
risen
already
its
silver
rays
fell
upon
the
ruins
of
karnak
upon
the
thickets
of
lotus
columns
upon
solitary
gateways
that
now
give
entrance
to
no
courts
upon
the
sacred
lake
with
its
reeds
where
the
black
were
asleep
upon
sloping
walls
shored
up
by
enormous
stanchions
like
ribs
of
some
prehistoric
leviathan
upon
small
chambers
upon
fallen
blocks
of
masonry
fragments
of
architrave
and
pavement
of
capital
and
cornice
and
upon
the
people
of
karnak
those
fascinating
people
who
still
cling
to
their
habitation
in
the
ruins
faithful
through
misfortune
affectionate
with
a
steadfastness
that
defies
the
cruelty
of
time
upon
the
little
lonely
white
sphinx
with
the
woman
s
face
and
the
eyes
full
of
sleepy
seduction
upon
rameses
with
the
face
of
a
kindly
child
not
of
a
king
upon
the
sphinx
bereft
of
its
companion
which
crouches
before
the
kiosk
of
taharga
the
king
of
ethiopia
upon
those
two
who
stand
together
as
if
devoted
yet
by
their
attitudes
seem
to
express
characters
diametrically
opposed
grey
men
and
vivid
the
one
with
folded
arms
calling
to
peace
the
other
with
arms
stretched
down
in
a
gesture
of
crude
determination
summoning
war
as
if
from
the
underworld
upon
the
granite
foot
and
ankle
in
the
temple
of
rameses
which
in
their
perfection
like
the
headless
victory
in
paris
and
the
niobide
chiaramonti
in
the
vatican
suggest
a
great
personality
that
once
met
with
is
not
to
be
forgotten
upon
these
and
their
companions
who
would
not
forsake
the
halls
and
courts
where
once
they
dwelt
with
splendor
where
now
they
dwell
with
ruin
that
attracts
the
gaping
world
the
moon
was
risen
but
the
west
was
still
full
of
color
and
light
it
faded
there
was
a
pause
only
a
bar
of
dull
red
holding
a
hint
of
brown
by
where
the
sun
had
sunk
and
minutes
passed
minutes
for
me
full
of
silent
expectation
while
the
moonlight
grew
a
little
stronger
a
few
more
silver
rays
slipped
down
upon
the
ruins
i
turned
toward
the
east
and
then
came
that
curious
crescendo
of
color
and
of
light
which
in
egypt
succeeds
the
diminuendo
of
color
and
of
light
that
is
the
prelude
to
the
pause
before
the
afterglow
everything
seemed
to
be
in
subtle
movement
heaving
as
a
breast
heaves
with
the
breath
swelling
slightly
as
if
in
an
effort
to
be
more
to
attract
attention
to
gain
in
significance
pale
things
became
livid
holding
apparently
some
which
partly
penetrated
its
envelope
but
a
brightness
that
was
white
and
almost
frightful
black
things
seemed
to
glow
with
blackness
the
air
quivered
its
silence
surely
thrilled
with
sound
with
sound
that
grew
ever
louder
in
the
east
i
saw
an
effect
to
the
west
i
turned
for
the
cause
the
sunset
light
was
returning
horus
would
not
permit
tum
to
reign
even
for
a
few
brief
moments
and
khuns
the
sacred
god
of
the
moon
would
be
witness
of
a
conflict
in
that
lovely
western
region
of
the
ocean
of
the
sky
where
the
bark
of
the
sun
had
floated
away
beneath
the
mountain
rim
upon
the
tides
the
afterglow
was
like
an
exquisite
spasm
is
always
like
an
exquisite
spasm
a
beautiful
almost
desperate
effort
ending
in
the
quiet
darkness
of
defeat
and
through
that
spasmodic
effort
a
world
lived
for
some
minutes
with
a
life
that
seemed
unreal
startling
magical
color
returned
to
the
sky
color
ethereal
trembling
as
if
it
knew
it
ought
not
to
return
yet
it
stayed
for
a
while
and
even
glowed
though
it
looked
always
strangely
purified
and
full
of
a
crystal
coldness
the
birds
that
flew
against
it
were
no
longer
birds
but
dark
moving
ornaments
devised
surely
by
a
supreme
artist
to
heighten
here
and
there
the
beauty
of
the
sky
everything
that
moved
against
the
afterglow
man
woman
child
camel
and
donkey
dog
and
goat
languishing
buffalo
and
plunging
horse
became
at
once
an
ornament
invented
i
fancied
by
a
genius
to
emphasize
by
relieving
it
the
color
in
which
the
sky
was
drowned
and
khuns
watched
serenely
as
if
he
knew
the
end
and
almost
suddenly
the
miraculous
effort
failed
things
again
revealed
their
truth
whether
commonplace
or
not
that
pool
of
the
nile
was
no
more
a
red
jewel
set
in
a
feathery
pattern
of
strange
design
but
only
water
fading
from
my
sight
beyond
a
group
of
palms
and
that
below
me
was
only
a
camel
going
homeward
and
that
a
child
leading
a
sheep
with
a
curly
coat
and
that
a
dusty
hovel
not
the
fairy
home
of
jinn
or
the
abode
of
some
magician
working
marvels
with
the
he
had
gathered
in
his
net
the
air
was
no
longer
thrilling
with
music
the
breast
that
had
heaved
with
a
divine
breath
was
still
as
the
breast
of
a
corpse
and
khuns
reigned
quietly
over
the
plains
of
karnak
karnak
has
no
distinctive
personality
built
under
many
kings
its
ruins
are
as
complex
as
were
probably
once
its
completed
temples
with
their
shrines
their
towers
their
courts
their
halls
as
i
looked
down
that
evening
in
the
moonlight
i
saw
softened
and
made
more
touching
than
in
those
alluring
complexities
brought
by
the
night
and
khuns
into
a
unity
that
was
both
tender
and
superb
masses
of
masonry
lay
jumbled
in
shadow
and
in
silver
gigantic
walls
cast
sharply
defined
gloom
obelisks
pointed
significantly
to
the
sky
seeming
as
they
always
do
to
be
murmuring
a
message
huge
doorways
stood
up
like
giants
unafraid
of
their
loneliness
and
yet
pathetic
in
it
here
was
a
watching
statue
there
one
that
seemed
to
sleep
seen
from
afar
yonder
queen
hatshepsu
who
wrought
wonders
at
and
who
is
more
familiar
perhaps
as
hatasu
had
left
there
traces
and
nearer
to
the
right
rameses
iii
had
made
a
temple
surely
for
the
birds
so
fond
they
are
of
it
so
pertinaciously
they
haunt
it
rameses
mutilated
and
immense
stood
on
guard
before
the
terrific
hall
of
seti
and
between
him
and
my
platform
in
the
air
rose
the
solitary
lotus
column
that
prepares
you
for
the
wonder
of
seti
s
hall
which
otherwise
might
almost
overwhelm
you
unless
you
are
a
scotch
lady
in
a
helmet
and
khuns
had
his
temple
here
by
the
sphinx
of
the
twelfth
rameses
and
ptah
who
created
the
sun
egg
and
the
moon
egg
and
who
was
said
only
said
alas
to
have
established
on
earth
the
everlasting
justice
had
his
and
still
their
stones
receive
the
silver
and
wake
the
wonder
of
men
thothmes
thothmes
shishak
who
smote
the
kneeling
prisoners
and
vanquished
jeroboam
medamut
and
mut
amenhotep
and
amenhotep
all
have
left
their
records
or
been
celebrated
at
karnak
purposely
i
mingled
them
in
my
mind
did
not
attempt
to
put
them
in
their
proper
order
or
even
to
disentangle
gods
and
goddesses
from
conquerors
and
kings
in
the
warm
and
seductive
night
khuns
whispered
to
me
as
long
ago
at
bekhten
i
exorcised
the
demon
from
the
suffering
princess
so
now
i
exorcise
from
these
ruins
all
spirits
but
my
own
these
ruins
shall
suggest
nothing
but
majesty
tranquillity
and
beauty
their
records
are
for
ra
and
must
be
studied
by
his
rays
in
mine
they
shall
speak
not
to
the
intellectual
but
only
to
the
emotions
and
the
and
presently
i
went
down
and
yielding
a
complete
and
happy
obedience
to
khuns
i
wandered
along
through
the
stupendous
vestiges
of
past
eras
dead
ambitions
vanished
glory
and
belief
and
i
ignored
eras
ambitions
glory
and
belief
and
thought
only
of
form
and
height
of
the
miracle
of
blackness
against
silver
and
of
the
pathos
of
statues
whose
eyes
at
night
when
one
is
near
them
suggest
the
working
of
some
evil
spell
perpetual
watchfulness
combined
with
eternal
inactivity
the
unslumbering
mind
caged
in
the
body
that
is
paralysed
there
is
a
temple
at
karnak
that
i
love
and
i
scarcely
know
why
i
care
for
it
so
much
it
is
on
the
right
of
the
solitary
lotus
column
before
you
come
to
the
terrific
hall
of
seti
some
people
pass
it
by
having
but
little
time
and
being
hypnotized
it
seems
by
the
more
astounding
ruin
that
lies
beyond
it
and
perhaps
it
would
be
well
on
a
first
visit
to
enter
it
last
to
let
its
influence
be
the
final
one
to
rest
upon
your
spirit
this
is
the
temple
of
rameses
a
brown
place
of
calm
and
retirement
an
ineffable
place
of
peace
yes
though
the
birds
love
it
and
fill
it
often
with
their
voices
it
is
a
sanctuary
of
peace
upon
the
floor
the
soft
sand
lies
placing
silence
beneath
your
footsteps
the
pale
brown
of
walls
and
columns
almost
yellow
in
the
sunshine
is
delicate
and
soothing
and
inclines
the
heart
to
calm
delicious
suggestive
of
a
beautiful
tapestry
rich
and
ornate
yet
always
quiet
are
the
brown
reliefs
upon
the
stone
what
are
they
does
it
matter
they
soften
the
walls
make
them
more
personal
more
tender
that
surely
is
their
mission
this
temple
holds
for
me
a
spell
as
soon
as
i
enter
it
i
feel
the
touch
of
the
lotus
as
if
an
invisible
and
kindly
hand
swept
a
blossom
lightly
across
my
face
and
downward
to
my
heart
this
courtyard
these
small
chambers
beyond
it
that
last
doorway
framing
a
lovely
darkness
soothe
me
even
more
than
the
hermitages
of
the
certosa
of
pavia
and
all
the
statues
here
are
calm
with
an
irrevocable
calmness
faithful
through
passing
years
with
a
very
sober
faithfulness
to
the
temple
they
adorn
in
no
other
place
one
feels
it
could
they
be
thus
at
peace
with
hands
crossed
for
ever
upon
their
breasts
which
are
torn
by
no
anxieties
thrilled
by
no
joys
as
one
stands
among
them
or
sitting
on
the
base
of
a
column
in
the
chamber
that
lies
beyond
them
looks
on
them
from
a
little
distance
their
attitude
is
like
a
summons
to
men
to
contend
no
more
to
be
still
to
enter
into
rest
come
to
this
temple
when
you
leave
the
hall
of
seti
there
you
are
in
a
place
of
triumph
scarlet
some
say
is
the
color
of
a
great
note
sounded
on
a
bugle
this
hall
is
like
a
of
the
past
thrilling
even
now
down
all
the
ages
with
a
triumph
that
is
surely
greater
than
any
other
triumphs
it
suggests
blaze
blaze
of
scarlet
blaze
of
bugle
blaze
of
glory
blaze
of
life
and
time
of
ambition
and
achievement
in
these
columns
in
the
putting
up
of
them
dead
men
sought
to
climb
to
sun
and
stars
limitless
in
desire
limitless
in
industry
limitless
in
will
and
at
the
tops
of
the
columns
blooms
the
lotus
the
symbol
of
rising
what
a
triumph
in
stone
this
hall
was
once
what
a
triumph
in
stone
its
ruin
is
perhaps
among
temples
it
is
the
most
wondrous
thing
in
all
egypt
as
it
was
no
doubt
the
most
wondrous
temple
in
the
world
among
temples
i
say
for
the
sphinx
is
of
all
the
marvels
of
egypt
by
far
the
most
marvellous
the
grandeur
of
this
hall
almost
moves
one
to
tears
like
the
marching
past
of
conquerors
stirs
the
heart
with
leaping
thrills
at
the
capacities
of
men
through
the
thicket
of
columns
tall
as
forest
trees
the
intense
blue
of
the
african
sky
stares
down
and
their
great
shadows
lie
along
the
warm
and
sunlit
ground
listen
there
are
voices
chanting
men
are
working
here
working
as
men
worked
how
many
thousands
of
years
ago
but
these
are
calling
upon
the
mohammedan
s
god
as
they
slowly
drag
to
the
appointed
places
the
mighty
blocks
of
stone
and
it
is
a
frenchman
who
oversees
them

the
dust
flies
up
about
their
naked
feet
triumph
and
work
work
succeeded
by
the
triumph
all
can
see
i
like
to
hear
the
workmen
s
voices
within
the
hall
of
seti
i
like
to
see
the
dust
stirred
by
their
tramping
feet
and
then
i
like
to
go
once
more
to
the
little
temple
to
enter
through
its
defaced
gateway
to
stand
alone
in
its
silence
between
the
rows
of
statues
with
their
arms
folded
upon
their
quiet
breasts
to
gaze
into
the
tender
darkness
beyond
the
darkness
that
looks
consecrated
to
feel
that
peace
is
more
wonderful
than
triumph
that
the
end
of
things
is
peace
triumph
and
deathless
peace
the
and
silence
these
are
the
notes
of
karnak
viii
luxor
upon
the
wall
of
the
great
court
of
amenhotep
iii
in
the
temple
of
luxor
there
is
a
delicious
dancing
procession
in
honor
of
rameses
ii
it
is
very
funny
and
very
happy
full
of
the
joy
of
life
a
sort
of
radiant
of
old
egyptian
days
how
supple
are
these
dancers
they
seem
to
have
no
bones
one
after
another
they
come
in
line
upon
the
mighty
wall
and
each
one
bends
backward
to
the
knees
of
the
one
who
follows
as
i
stood
and
looked
at
them
for
the
first
time
almost
i
heard
the
twitter
of
flutes
the
rustic
wail
of
the
african
hautboy
the
monotonous
boom
of
the
derabukkeh
cries
of
a
gaiety
such
as
one
often
hears
from
the
nile
by
night
but
these
cries
came
down
the
long
avenues
of
the
centuries
this
gaiety
was
distant
in
the
vasty
halls
of
the
years
never
can
i
think
of
luxor
without
thinking
of
those
happy
dancers
without
thinking
of
the
life
that
goes
in
the
sun
on
dancing
feet
there
are
a
few
places
in
the
world
that
one
associates
with
happiness
that
one
remembers
always
with
a
smile
a
little
thrill
at
the
heart
that
whispers
there
joy
of
these
few
places
luxor
is
one
luxor
the
home
of
sunshine
the
suave
abode
of
light
of
warmth
of
the
sweet
days
of
gold
and
sheeny
golden
sunsets
of
silver
shimmering
nights
through
which
the
songs
of
the
boatmen
of
the
nile
go
floating
to
the
courts
and
the
tombs
of
thebes
the
roses
bloom
in
luxor
under
the
mighty
palms
always
surely
beneath
the
palms
there
are
the
roses
and
the
come
up
the
nile
looking
like
promises
of
future
golden
days
and
at
dawn
one
wakes
with
hope
and
hears
the
songs
of
the
dawn
and
at
noon
one
dreams
of
the
happiness
to
come
and
at
sunset
one
is
swept
away
on
the
gold
into
the
heart
of
the
golden
world
and
at
night
one
looks
at
the
stars
and
each
star
is
a
twinkling
hope
soft
are
the
airs
of
luxor
there
is
no
harshness
in
the
wind
that
stirs
the
leaves
of
the
palms
and
the
land
is
steeped
in
light
from
luxor
one
goes
with
regret
one
returns
to
it
with
joy
on
dancing
feet
one
day
i
sat
in
the
temple
in
the
huge
court
with
the
great
double
row
of
columns
that
stands
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
looks
so
splendid
from
it
the
pale
brown
of
the
stone
became
almost
yellow
in
the
sunshine
from
the
river
hidden
from
me
stole
up
the
songs
of
the
boatmen
nearer
at
hand
i
heard
pigeons
cooing
cooing
in
the
sun
as
if
almost
too
glad
and
seeking
to
manifest
their
gladness
behind
me
through
the
columns
peeped
some
houses
of
the
village
the
white
home
of
ibrahim
ayyad
the
perfect
dragoman
grandson
of
mustapha
aga
who
entertained
me
years
ago
and
whose
house
stood
actually
within
the
precincts
of
the
temple
houses
of
other
fortunate
dwellers
in
luxor
whose
names
i
do
not
know
for
the
village
of
luxor
crowds
boldly
about
the
temple
and
the
children
play
in
the
dust
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
obelisks
and
statues
high
on
a
brown
hump
of
earth
a
buffalo
stood
alone
languishing
serenely
in
the
sun
gazing
at
me
through
the
columns
with
light
eyes
that
were
full
of
a
sort
of
folly
of
contentment
some
goats
tripped
by
brown
against
the
brown
stone
the
dark
brown
earth
of
the
native
houses
intimate
life
was
here
striking
the
note
of
coziness
of
luxor
here
was
none
of
the
sadness
and
the
majesty
of
denderah
grand
are
the
ruins
of
luxor
noble
is
the
line
of
columns
that
boldly
fronts
the
nile
but
time
has
given
them
naked
to
the
air
and
to
the
sun
to
children
and
to
animals
instead
of
bats
the
pigeons
fly
about
them
there
is
no
dreadful
darkness
in
their
sanctuaries
before
them
the
life
of
the
river
behind
them
the
life
of
the
village
flows
and
stirs
upon
them
looks
down
the
minaret
of
abu
haggag
and
as
i
sat
in
the
sunshine
the
warmth
of
which
began
to
lessen
i
saw
upon
its
lofty
circular
balcony
the
figure
of
the
muezzin
he
leaned
over
bending
toward
the
temple
and
the
statues
of
rameses
ii
and
the
happy
dancers
on
the
wall
he
opened
his
lips
and
cried
to
them
god
is
great
god
is
great
i
bear
witness
that
there
is
no
god
but
god
i
bear
witness
that
mohammed
is
the
apostle
of
god
come
to
prayer
come
to
prayer
god
is
great
god
is
great
there
is
no
god
but
he
circled
round
the
minaret
he
cried
to
the
nile
he
cried
to
the
colossi
sitting
in
their
plain
and
to
the
yellow
precipices
of
the
mountains
of
libya
he
cried
to
egypt
come
to
prayer
come
to
prayer
there
is
no
god
but
god
there
is
no
god
but
the
days
of
the
gods
were
dead
and
their
ruined
temple
echoed
with
the
proclamation
of
the
one
god
of
the
moslem
world
come
to
prayer
come
to
prayer
the
sun
began
to
sink
sunset
and
evening
star
and
one
clear
call
for
the
voice
of
the
muezzin
died
away
there
was
a
silence
and
then
as
if
in
answer
to
the
cry
from
the
minaret
i
heard
the
chime
of
the
angelus
bell
from
the
catholic
church
of
luxor
twilight
and
evening
bell
and
after
that
the
i
sat
very
still
the
light
was
fading
all
the
yellow
was
fading
too
from
the
columns
and
the
temple
walls
i
stayed
till
it
was
dark
and
with
the
dark
the
old
gods
seemed
to
resume
their
interrupted
sway
and
surely
they
too
called
to
prayer
for
do
not
these
ruins
of
old
egypt
like
the
muezzin
upon
the
minaret
like
the
angelus
bell
in
the
church
tower
call
one
to
prayer
in
the
night
so
wonderful
are
they
under
stars
and
moon
that
they
stir
the
fleshly
and
the
worldly
desires
that
lie
like
drifted
leaves
about
the
reverence
and
the
aspiration
that
are
the
hidden
core
of
the
heart
and
it
is
released
from
its
burden
and
it
awakes
and
prays
mut
and
khuns
the
king
of
the
gods
his
wife
mother
of
gods
and
the
moon
god
were
the
theban
triad
to
whom
the
holy
buildings
of
thebes
on
the
two
banks
of
the
nile
were
dedicated
and
this
temple
of
luxor
the
house
of
amun
in
the
southern
apt
was
built
fifteen
hundred
years
before
christ
by
amenhotep
iii
rameses
that
vehement
builder
added
to
it
immensely
one
walks
among
his
traces
when
one
walks
in
luxor
and
here
as
at
denderah
christians
have
let
loose
the
fury
that
should
have
had
no
place
in
their
religion
churches
for
their
worship
they
made
in
different
parts
of
the
temple
and
when
they
were
not
praying
they
broke
in
pieces
statues
defaced
and
smashed
up
shrines
with
a
vigor
quite
as
great
as
that
displayed
in
preservation
by
christians
of
now
time
has
called
a
truce
safe
are
the
statues
that
are
left
and
day
by
day
two
great
religions
almost
as
if
in
happy
brotherly
love
send
forth
their
summons
by
the
temple
walls
and
just
beyond
those
walls
upon
the
hill
there
is
a
coptic
church
peace
reigns
in
happy
luxor
the
lion
lies
down
with
the
lamb
and
the
child
if
it
will
may
harmlessly
put
its
hand
into
the
cockatrice
s
den
perhaps
because
it
is
so
surrounded
so
haunted
by
life
and
familiar
things
because
the
pigeons
fly
about
it
the
buffalo
stares
into
it
the
goats
stir
up
the
dust
beside
its
columns
the
twittering
voices
of
women
make
a
music
near
its
courts
many
people
pay
little
heed
to
this
great
temple
gain
but
a
small
impression
from
it
it
decorates
the
bank
of
the
nile
you
can
see
it
from
the
dahabiyehs
for
many
that
is
enough
yet
the
temple
is
a
noble
one
and
for
me
it
gains
a
definite
attraction
all
its
own
from
the
busy
life
about
it
the
cheerful
hum
and
stir
and
if
you
want
fully
to
realize
its
dignity
you
can
always
visit
it
by
night
then
the
cries
from
the
village
are
hushed
the
houses
show
no
lights
only
the
voices
from
the
nile
steal
up
to
the
obelisk
of
rameses
to
the
pylon
from
which
the
flags
of
thebes
once
flew
on
festal
days
to
the
shrine
of
alexander
the
great
with
its
vultures
and
its
stars
and
to
the
red
granite
statues
of
rameses
and
his
wives
these
last
are
as
expressive
as
and
of
course
more
definite
than
my
dancers
they
are
full
of
character
they
seem
to
breathe
out
the
essence
of
a
vanished
domesticity
colossal
are
the
statues
of
the
king
solid
powerful
and
tremendous
boldly
facing
the
world
with
the
calm
of
one
who
was
thought
and
possibly
thought
himself
to
be
not
much
less
than
a
deity
and
upon
each
pedestal
shrinking
delicately
back
was
once
a
little
wife
some
little
wives
are
left
they
are
delicious
in
their
modesty
each
stands
away
from
the
king
shyly
respectfully
each
is
so
small
as
to
be
below
his
arm
each
with
a
surely
furtive
gesture
reaches
out
her
right
hand
and
attains
the
swelling
calf
of
her
noble
husband
s
leg
plump
are
their
little
faces
but
not
one
can
not
pity
the
king
nor
does
one
pity
them
for
these
were
not
les
desenchantees
the
restless
women
of
an
eastern
world
that
knows
too
much
their
longings
surely
can
not
have
been
very
great
their
world
was
probably
bounded
by
the
calf
of
rameses
s
leg
that
was
the
far
horizon
of
the
little
wives
the
happy
dancers
and
the
humble
wives
they
always
come
before
me
with
the
temple
of
luxor
joy
and
discretion
side
by
side
and
with
them
to
my
ears
the
two
voices
seem
to
come
muezzin
and
angelus
bell
mingling
not
in
war
but
peace
when
i
think
of
this
temple
i
think
of
its
joy
and
peace
far
less
than
of
its
majesty
and
yet
it
is
majestic
look
at
it
as
i
have
often
done
toward
sunset
from
the
western
bank
of
the
nile
or
climb
the
mound
beyond
its
northern
end
where
stands
the
grand
entrance
and
you
realize
at
once
its
nobility
and
solemn
splendor
from
the
deck
it
was
a
procession
of
great
columns
that
was
all
but
the
decorative
effect
of
these
columns
soaring
above
the
river
and
its
vivid
life
is
fine
by
day
all
is
turmoil
on
the
barges
are
unloading
steamers
are
arriving
and
throngs
of
and
dragomans
go
down
in
haste
to
meet
them
servants
run
to
and
fro
on
errands
from
the
many
dahabiyehs
bathers
leap
into
the
brown
waters
the
native
craft
pass
by
with
their
enormous
sails
outspread
to
catch
the
wind
bearing
serried
mobs
of
men
and
women
and
laughing
singing
children
the
boatmen
of
the
hotels
sing
monotonously
as
they
lounge
in
the
big
white
boats
waiting
for
travellers
to
to
the
ramesseum
to
kurna
and
the
tombs
and
just
above
them
rise
the
long
lines
of
columns
ancient
tranquil
and
remote
infinitely
remote
for
all
their
nearness
casting
down
upon
the
sunlit
gaiety
the
long
shadow
of
the
past
from
the
edge
of
the
mound
where
stands
the
native
village
the
effect
of
the
temple
is
much
less
decorative
but
its
detailed
grandeur
can
be
better
grasped
from
there
for
from
there
one
sees
the
great
towers
of
the
propylon
two
rows
of
mighty
columns
the
red
granite
obelisk
of
rameses
the
great
and
the
black
granite
statues
of
the
king
on
the
right
of
the
entrance
a
giant
stands
on
the
left
one
is
seated
and
a
little
farther
away
a
third
emerges
from
the
ground
which
reaches
to
its
mighty
breast
and
there
the
children
play
perpetually
and
there
the
egyptians
sing
their
serenades
making
the
pipes
wail
and
striking
the
derabukkeh
and
there
the
women
gossip
and
twitter
like
the
birds
and
the
buffalo
comes
to
take
his
and
the
goats
and
the
curly
brown
sheep
pass
in
sprightly
and
calm
processions
the
obelisk
there
like
its
brother
in
paris
presides
over
a
cheerfulness
of
life
but
it
is
a
life
that
seems
akin
to
it
not
alien
from
it
and
the
king
watches
the
simplicity
of
this
keen
existence
of
egypt
of
far
up
the
nile
with
a
calm
that
one
does
not
fear
may
be
broken
by
unsympathetic
outrage
or
by
any
vision
of
too
perpetual
foreign
life
for
the
tourists
each
year
are
but
an
episode
in
upper
egypt
still
the
sings
his
ancient
song
violent
and
pathetic
bold
as
the
burning
still
the
fellaheen
plough
with
the
camel
yoked
with
the
ox
still
the
women
are
covered
with
protective
amulets
and
hold
their
black
draperies
in
their
mouths
the
intimate
life
of
the
nile
remains
the
same
and
that
life
obelisk
and
king
have
known
for
how
many
many
years
and
so
i
love
to
think
of
this
intimacy
of
life
about
the
temple
of
the
happy
dancers
and
the
humble
little
wives
and
it
seems
to
me
to
strike
the
keynote
of
the
golden
coziness
of
luxor
ix
colossi
of
memnon
nevertheless
sometimes
one
likes
to
escape
from
the
thing
one
loves
and
there
are
hours
when
the
gay
voices
of
luxor
fatigue
the
ears
when
one
desires
a
great
calm
then
there
are
silent
voices
that
summon
one
across
the
river
when
the
dawn
is
breaking
over
the
hills
of
the
arabian
desert
or
when
the
sun
is
declining
toward
the
libyan
mountains
voices
issuing
from
lips
of
stone
from
the
twilight
of
sanctuaries
from
the
depths
of
tombs
the
peace
of
the
plain
of
thebes
in
the
early
morning
is
very
rare
and
very
exquisite
it
is
not
the
peace
of
the
desert
but
rather
perhaps
the
peace
of
the
prairie
an
atmosphere
tender
delicately
thrilling
softly
bright
hopeful
in
its
gleaming
calm
often
and
often
have
i
left
the
very
early
moored
against
the
long
sand
islet
that
faces
luxor
when
the
nile
has
not
subsided
i
have
rowed
across
the
quiet
water
that
divided
me
from
the
western
bank
and
with
a
happy
heart
i
have
entered
into
the
lovely
peace
of
the
great
spaces
that
stretch
from
the
colossi
of
memnon
to
the
nile
to
the
mountains
southward
toward
armant
northward
to
kerekten
to
danfik
to
think
of
the
color
of
young
clover
of
young
barley
of
young
wheat
think
of
the
timbre
of
the
reed
flute
s
voice
thin
clear
and
frail
with
the
frailty
of
dewdrops
think
of
the
torrents
of
spring
rushing
through
the
veins
of
a
great
wide
land
and
growing
almost
still
at
last
on
their
journey
spring
you
will
say
perhaps
and
high
nile
not
yet
subsided
but
egypt
is
the
favored
land
of
a
spring
that
is
already
alert
at
the
end
of
november
and
in
december
is
pushing
forth
its
green
the
nile
has
sunk
away
from
the
feet
of
the
colossi
that
it
has
bathed
through
many
days
it
has
freed
the
plain
to
the
fellaheen
though
still
it
keeps
my
island
in
its
clasp
and
hapi
or
the
great
extender
and
ra
have
made
this
wonderful
spring
to
bloom
on
the
dark
earth
before
the
christian
s
christmas
what
a
pastoral
it
is
this
plain
of
thebes
in
the
dawn
of
day
think
of
the
reed
flute
i
have
said
not
because
you
will
hear
it
as
you
ride
toward
the
mountains
but
because
its
voice
would
be
utterly
in
place
here
in
this
arcady
of
egypt
playing
no
tarantella
but
one
of
those
songs
half
and
half
sadly
mysteriously
human
which
come
from
the
soul
of
the
east
instead
of
it
you
may
catch
distant
cries
from
the
bank
of
the
river
where
the
toils
lifting
ever
the
water
and
his
voice
the
one
to
earth
the
other
it
seems
to
sky
and
the
creaking
lay
of
the
which
pervades
upper
egypt
like
an
atmosphere
and
which
though
perhaps
at
first
it
irritates
at
last
seems
to
you
the
sound
of
the
soul
of
the
river
of
the
sunshine
and
the
soil
much
of
the
land
looks
painted
so
flat
is
it
so
young
are
the
growing
crops
that
they
are
like
a
coating
of
green
paint
spread
over
a
mighty
canvas
but
the
doura
rises
higher
than
the
heads
of
the
naked
children
who
stand
among
it
to
watch
you
canter
past
and
in
the
far
distance
you
see
dim
groups
of
trees
sycamores
and
acacias
tamarisks
and
palms
beyond
them
is
the
very
heart
of
this
land
of
sand
and
ruins
and
gold
the
ramesseum
medinet
kurna
the
tombs
of
the
kings
the
tombs
of
the
queens
and
of
the
princes
in
the
strip
of
bare
land
at
the
foot
of
those
hard
and
yet
poetic
mountains
have
been
dug
up
treasures
the
fame
of
which
has
gone
to
the
ends
of
the
world
but
this
plain
where
the
fellaheen
are
stooping
to
the
soil
and
the
women
are
carrying
the
and
the
children
are
playing
in
the
doura
and
the
oxen
and
the
camels
are
working
with
ploughs
that
look
like
relics
of
days
is
the
possession
of
the
two
great
presiding
beings
whom
you
see
from
an
enormous
distance
the
colossi
of
memnon
amenhotep
iii
put
them
where
they
are
so
we
are
told
but
in
this
early
morning
it
is
not
possible
to
think
of
them
as
being
brought
to
any
place
seated
the
one
beside
the
other
facing
the
nile
and
the
home
of
the
rising
sun
their
immense
aspect
of
patience
suggests
will
calmly
steadily
exercised
suggests
choice
that
for
some
reason
as
yet
unknown
they
chose
to
come
to
this
plain
that
they
choose
solemnly
to
remain
there
waiting
while
the
harvests
grow
and
are
gathered
about
their
feet
while
the
nile
rises
and
subsides
while
the
years
and
the
generations
come
like
the
harvests
and
are
stored
away
in
the
granaries
of
the
past
their
calm
broods
over
this
plain
gives
to
it
a
personal
atmosphere
which
sets
it
quite
apart
from
every
other
flat
space
of
the
world
there
is
no
place
that
i
know
on
the
earth
which
has
the
peculiar
bright
ineffable
calm
of
the
plain
of
these
colossi
it
takes
you
into
its
breast
and
you
lie
there
in
the
growing
sunshine
almost
as
if
you
were
a
child
laid
in
the
lap
of
one
of
them
that
legend
of
the
singing
at
dawn
of
the
vocal
memnon
how
could
it
have
arisen
how
could
such
calmness
sing
such
patience
ever
find
a
voice
unlike
the
sphinx
which
becomes
ever
more
impressive
as
you
draw
near
to
it
and
is
most
impressive
when
you
sit
almost
at
its
feet
the
colossi
lose
in
personality
as
you
approach
them
and
can
see
how
they
have
been
defaced
from
afar
one
feels
their
minds
their
strange
unearthly
temperaments
commanding
this
pastoral
when
you
are
beside
them
this
feeling
disappears
their
features
are
gone
and
though
in
their
attitudes
there
is
power
and
there
is
something
that
awakens
awe
they
are
more
wonderful
as
a
feature
of
the
plain
they
gain
in
grandeur
from
the
night
in
strangeness
from
the
moonrise
perhaps
specially
when
the
nile
comes
to
their
feet
more
than
three
thousand
years
old
they
look
less
eternal
than
the
sphinx
like
them
the
sphinx
is
waiting
but
with
a
greater
purpose
the
sphinx
reduces
man
really
to
nothingness
the
colossi
leave
him
some
remnants
of
individuality
one
can
conceive
of
strabo
and
aelius
gallus
of
hadrian
and
sabina
of
others
who
came
over
the
sunlit
land
to
hear
the
unearthly
song
in
the
dawn
being
of
some
not
much
but
still
of
some
importance
here
before
the
sphinx
no
one
is
important
but
in
the
distance
of
the
plain
the
colossi
shed
a
real
magic
of
calm
and
solemn
personality
and
subtly
seem
to
mingle
their
spirit
with
the
flat
green
world
so
wide
so
still
so
fecund
and
so
peaceful
with
the
soft
airs
that
are
surely
scented
with
an
eternal
springtime
and
with
the
light
that
the
morning
rains
down
on
wheat
and
clover
on
indian
corn
and
barley
and
on
brown
men
laboring
who
perhaps
from
the
patience
of
the
colossi
in
repose
have
drawn
a
patience
in
labor
that
has
in
it
something
not
less
sublime
from
the
colossi
one
goes
onward
toward
the
trees
and
the
mountains
and
very
soon
one
comes
to
the
edge
of
that
strange
and
fascinating
strip
of
barren
land
which
is
strewn
with
temples
and
honeycombed
with
tombs
the
sun
burns
down
on
it
the
heat
seems
thrown
back
upon
it
by
the
wall
of
tawny
mountains
that
bounds
it
on
the
west
it
is
dusty
it
is
arid
it
is
haunted
by
swarms
of
flies
by
the
guardians
of
the
ruins
and
by
men
and
boys
trying
to
sell
enormous
scarabs
and
necklaces
and
amulets
made
yesterday
and
the
day
before
in
the
manufactory
of
kurna
from
many
points
it
looks
not
unlike
a
strangely
prolonged
in
which
busy
giants
have
been
digging
with
huge
spades
making
mounds
and
pits
caverns
and
trenches
piling
up
here
a
monstrous
heap
of
stones
casting
down
there
a
mighty
statue
but
how
it
fascinates
of
curse
one
knows
what
it
means
one
knows
that
on
this
strip
of
land
naville
dug
out
at
the
temple
of
and
discovered
later
in
her
shrine
hathor
the
with
the
streaming
from
her
sacred
forehead
to
her
feet
that
long
before
him
mariette
here
brought
to
the
light
at
the
treasures
of
kings
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
dynasties
that
at
the
foot
of
those
precipices
theodore
davis
the
american
found
the
sepulcher
of
queen
hatshepsu
the
queen
elizabeth
of
the
old
egyptian
world
and
later
the
tomb
of
yuaa
and
thuaa
the
parents
of
queen
thiy
containing
covered
with
gold
jars
of
oil
and
wine
gold
silver
and
alabaster
boxes
a
bed
decorated
with
gilded
ivory
a
chair
with
gilded
plaster
reliefs
chairs
of
state
and
a
chariot
that
here
maspero
victor
loret
brugsch
bey
and
other
patient
workers
gave
to
the
world
tombs
that
had
been
hidden
and
unknown
for
centuries
that
there
to
the
north
is
the
temple
of
kurna
and
over
there
the
ramesseum
that
those
rows
of
little
pillars
close
under
the
mountain
and
looking
strangely
modern
are
the
pillars
of
hatshepsu
s
temple
which
bears
upon
its
walls
the
pictures
of
the
expedition
to
the
historic
land
of
punt
that
the
kings
were
buried
there
and
there
the
queens
and
the
princes
of
the
vanished
dynasties
that
beyond
to
the
west
is
the
temple
of
with
its
judgment
of
the
dead
that
here
by
the
native
village
is
one
knows
that
and
so
the
imagination
is
awake
ready
to
paint
the
lily
and
to
gild
the
beaten
gold
but
even
if
one
did
not
know
i
think
one
would
be
fascinated
this
turmoil
of
earth
and
rock
grey
yellow
pink
orange
and
red
awakens
the
curiosity
summons
the
love
of
the
strange
suggests
that
it
holds
secrets
to
charm
the
souls
of
men
x
at
the
entrance
to
the
temple
of
near
the
small
groups
of
palms
and
the
few
brown
houses
often
have
i
turned
and
looked
back
across
the
plain
before
entering
through
the
first
beautiful
doorway
to
see
the
patient
backs
and
right
sides
of
the
colossi
the
dreamy
mountains
beyond
karnak
and
the
nile
and
again
when
i
have
entered
and
walked
a
little
distance
i
have
looked
back
at
the
almost
magical
picture
framed
in
the
doorway
at
the
bottom
of
the
picture
a
layer
of
brown
earth
then
a
strip
of
sharp
green
the
cultivated
ground
then
a
blur
of
pale
yellow
then
a
darkness
of
trees
and
just
the
hint
of
a
hill
far
very
far
away
and
always
in
looking
i
have
thought
of
the
sposalizio
of
raphael
in
the
brera
at
milan
of
the
tiny
dream
of
blue
country
framed
by
the
temple
doorway
beyond
the
virgin
and
saint
joseph
the
doorways
of
the
temples
of
egypt
are
very
noble
and
nowhere
have
i
been
more
struck
by
their
nobility
than
in
set
in
huge
walls
of
massive
masonry
which
rise
slightly
above
them
on
each
side
with
a
projecting
cornice
in
their
simplicity
they
look
extraordinarily
classical
in
their
sobriety
mysterious
and
in
their
great
solidity
quite
wonderfully
elegant
and
they
always
suggest
to
me
that
they
are
giving
access
to
courts
and
chambers
which
still
even
in
our
times
are
dedicated
to
secret
cults
to
the
cults
of
isis
of
hathor
and
of
osiris
close
to
the
right
of
the
front
of
there
are
trees
covered
with
yellow
flowers
beyond
are
fields
of
doura
behind
the
temple
is
a
sterility
which
makes
one
think
of
metal
a
great
calm
enfolds
the
place
the
buildings
are
of
the
same
color
as
the
colossi
when
i
speak
of
the
buildings
i
include
the
great
temple
the
pavilion
of
rameses
and
the
little
temple
which
together
may
be
said
to
form
whereas
the
temple
of
luxor
seems
to
open
its
arms
to
life
and
the
great
fascination
of
the
ramesseum
comes
partly
from
its
invasion
by
every
traveling
air
and
happy
its
openness
and
freedom
impresses
by
its
colossal
air
of
secrecy
by
its
seclusion
its
walls
are
immensely
thick
and
are
covered
with
figures
the
same
color
as
the
walls
some
of
them
very
tall
massive
heavy
almost
warlike
it
is
two
seated
statues
within
statues
with
animals
faces
or
perhaps
a
little
darker
than
that
look
like
savage
warders
ready
to
repel
intrusion
passing
between
them
delicately
as
agag
one
enters
an
open
space
with
ruins
upon
the
right
of
which
is
a
low
small
temple
grey
in
hue
and
covered
with
inscriptions
which
looks
almost
bowed
under
its
tremendous
weight
of
years
from
this
dignified
though
tiny
veteran
there
comes
a
perpetual
sound
of
birds
the
birds
in
egypt
have
no
reverence
for
age
never
have
i
seen
them
more
restless
more
gay
or
more
impertinent
than
in
the
immemorial
ruins
of
the
ancient
land
beyond
is
an
enormous
portal
on
the
lofty
ceiling
of
which
still
linger
traces
of
faded
red
and
blue
which
gives
access
to
a
great
hall
with
rows
of
mighty
columns
those
on
the
left
hand
round
those
on
the
right
square
and
almost
terribly
massive
there
is
in
these
no
grace
as
in
the
giant
lotus
columns
of
karnak
prodigious
heavy
barbaric
they
are
like
a
hymn
in
stone
to
strength
there
is
something
brutal
in
their
aspect
which
again
makes
one
think
of
war
of
assaults
repelled
hordes
beaten
back
like
waves
by
a
and
still
another
great
hall
with
more
gigantic
columns
lies
in
the
sun
beyond
and
a
doorway
through
which
seems
to
stare
fiercely
the
edge
of
a
hard
and
fiery
mountain
although
one
is
roofed
by
the
sky
there
is
something
oppressive
here
an
imprisoned
feeling
comes
over
one
i
could
never
be
fond
of
as
i
am
fond
of
luxor
of
parts
of
karnak
of
the
whole
of
delicious
poetical
philae
the
big
pylons
with
their
great
walls
sloping
inward
and
glowing
with
very
pale
yellow
in
the
sun
the
resistant
walls
the
brutal
columns
the
huge
and
almost
savage
scale
of
everything
always
remind
me
of
the
violence
in
men
and
also
i
scarcely
know
why
make
me
think
of
the
north
of
sullen
northern
castles
by
the
sea
in
places
where
skies
are
grey
and
the
white
of
foam
and
snow
is
married
in
angry
nights
and
yet
in
there
reigns
a
splendid
calm
a
calm
that
sometimes
seems
massive
resistant
as
the
columns
and
the
walls
peace
is
certainly
inclosed
by
the
stones
that
call
up
thoughts
of
war
as
if
perhaps
their
purpose
had
been
achieved
many
centuries
ago
and
they
were
quit
of
enemies
for
ever
rameses
iii
is
connected
with
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
egyptian
kings
and
has
been
called
the
last
of
the
great
sovereigns
of
he
ruled
for
years
and
when
after
a
first
visit
to
i
looked
into
his
records
i
was
interested
to
find
that
his
conquests
and
his
wars
had
a
character
essentially
this
defensive
spirit
is
incarnated
in
the
stones
of
these
ruins
one
reads
in
them
something
of
the
soul
of
this
king
who
lived
twelve
hundred
years
before
christ
and
who
desired
in
remembrance
of
his
syrian
victories
to
give
to
his
memorial
temple
an
outward
military
aspect
i
noticed
a
military
aspect
at
once
inside
this
temple
but
if
you
circle
the
buildings
outside
it
is
more
unmistakable
for
the
east
front
has
a
battlemented
wall
and
the
battlements
are
this
fortress
or
migdol
a
name
which
the
ancient
egyptians
borrowed
from
the
nomadic
tribes
of
syria
is
called
the
pavilion
of
rameses
and
his
principal
battles
are
represented
upon
its
walls
the
monarch
does
not
hesitate
to
speak
of
himself
in
terms
of
praise
suggesting
that
he
was
like
the
god
mentu
who
was
the
egyptian
war
god
and
whose
cult
at
thebes
was
at
one
period
more
important
even
than
was
the
cult
of
amun
and
also
plainly
hinting
that
he
was
a
brave
fellow
i
rameses
the
king
he
murmurs
behaved
as
a
hero
who
knows
his
if
hieroglyphs
are
to
be
trusted
various
egyptian
kings
of
ancient
times
seem
to
have
had
some
vague
suspicion
of
their
own
value
and
the
walls
of
are
to
speak
sincerely
one
mighty
boast
in
his
later
years
the
king
lived
in
peace
and
luxury
surrounded
by
a
vicious
and
intriguing
court
haunted
by
magicians
hags
and
dealers
in
magic
may
still
be
found
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
happy
luxor
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
two
when
i
was
there
one
of
whom
offered
for
a
couple
of
pounds
to
provide
me
with
a
preservative
against
all
such
dangers
as
beset
the
traveller
in
wild
places
in
order
to
prove
its
efficacy
he
asked
me
to
come
to
his
house
by
night
bringing
a
dog
and
my
revolver
with
me
he
would
hang
the
charm
about
the
dog
s
neck
and
i
was
then
to
put
six
shots
into
the
animal
s
body
he
positively
assured
me
that
the
dog
would
be
uninjured
i
to
come
and
when
night
began
to
fall
looked
vaguely
about
for
a
dog
at
last
i
found
one
but
it
howled
so
dismally
when
i
asked
ibrahim
ayyad
to
take
possession
of
it
for
experimental
purposes
that
i
weakly
gave
up
the
project
and
left
the
magician
clamoring
for
his
hundred
and
piastres
its
warlike
aspect
gives
a
special
personality
to
the
battlements
the
courtyards
with
their
brutal
columns
narrowing
as
they
recede
towards
the
mountains
the
heavy
gateways
with
superimposed
chambers
the
towers
quadrangular
bastion
to
protect
inclined
basement
to
resist
the
attacks
of
sappers
and
cause
projectiles
to
rebound
all
these
things
contribute
to
this
very
definite
effect
i
have
heard
travelers
on
the
nile
speak
piteously
of
the
confusion
wakened
in
their
minds
by
a
hurried
survey
of
many
temples
statues
monuments
and
tombs
but
if
one
stays
long
enough
this
confusion
fades
happily
away
and
one
differentiates
between
the
antique
personalities
of
ancient
egypt
almost
as
easily
as
one
differentiates
between
the
personalities
of
one
s
familiar
friends
among
these
personalities
is
the
warrior
standing
like
mentu
with
the
solar
disk
and
the
two
plumes
erect
above
his
head
of
a
hawk
firmly
planted
at
the
foot
of
the
theban
mountains
ready
to
repel
all
enemies
to
beat
back
all
assaults
strong
and
determined
powerful
and
brutally
serene
xi
the
ramesseum
this
my
lord
is
the
of
rameses
the
so
said
ibrahim
ayyad
to
me
one
morning
ibrahim
who
is
almost
as
prolific
in
the
abrupt
creation
of
peers
as
if
he
were
a
democratic
government
i
looked
about
me
we
stood
in
a
ruined
hall
with
columns
architraves
covered
with
inscriptions
segments
of
flat
roof
here
and
there
traces
of
painting
pale
ethereal
blue
the
of
egypt
as
the
egyptians
often
call
it
still
adhered
to
the
stone
this
hall
dignified
grand
but
happy
was
open
on
all
sides
to
the
sun
and
air
from
it
i
could
see
and
and
shadowy
mountains
beyond
the
eastern
verge
of
the
nile
and
the
trees
were
still
as
carven
things
in
an
atmosphere
that
was
a
miracle
of
clearness
and
of
purity
behind
me
and
near
the
hard
libyan
mountains
gleamed
in
the
sun
somewhere
a
boy
was
singing
and
suddenly
his
singing
died
away
and
i
thought
of
the
lay
of
the
harper
which
is
inscribed
upon
the
tombs
of
thebes
those
tombs
under
those
gleaming
mountains
for
no
one
carries
away
his
goods
with
him
yea
no
one
returns
again
who
has
gone
it
took
the
place
of
the
song
that
had
died
as
i
thought
of
the
great
king
s
glory
that
he
had
been
here
and
had
long
since
passed
away
the
of
rameses
the
great
you
must
leave
me
alone
here
i
watched
his
robe
vanish
into
the
gold
of
the
sun
through
the
copper
color
of
the
columns
and
i
was
quite
alone
in
the
of
rameses
it
was
a
brilliant
day
the
sky
dark
sapphire
blue
without
even
the
spectre
of
a
cloud
or
any
airy
vaporous
veil
the
heat
already
intense
in
the
full
sunshine
but
delicious
if
one
slid
into
a
shadow
i
slid
into
a
shadow
and
sat
down
on
a
warm
block
of
stone
and
the
silence
flowed
upon
me
the
silence
of
the
ramesseum
was
the
winged
disk
with
crowned
ever
set
up
above
this
temple
s
principal
door
to
keep
it
from
destruction
i
do
not
know
but
if
he
was
he
failed
perfectly
to
fulfil
his
mission
and
i
am
glad
he
failed
i
am
glad
of
the
ruin
that
is
here
glad
that
walls
have
crumbled
or
been
overthrown
that
columns
have
been
cast
down
and
ceilings
torn
off
from
the
pillars
that
supported
them
letting
in
the
sky
i
would
have
nothing
different
in
the
of
rameses
like
a
cloud
a
great
golden
cloud
a
glory
impending
that
will
not
can
not
be
dissolved
into
the
ether
he
loomed
over
the
egypt
that
is
dead
he
looms
over
the
egypt
of
everywhere
you
meet
his
traces
everywhere
you
hear
his
name
you
say
to
a
tall
young
egyptian
how
big
you
are
growing
hassan
he
answers
come
back
next
year
my
gentleman
and
i
shall
be
like
rameses
the
or
you
ask
of
the
boatman
who
rows
you
how
can
you
pull
all
day
against
the
current
of
the
nile
and
he
smiles
and
lifting
his
brown
arm
he
says
to
you
look
i
am
strong
as
rameses
the
this
familiar
fame
comes
down
through
some
twenty
years
carved
upon
limestone
and
granite
now
it
seems
engraven
also
on
every
egyptian
heart
that
beats
not
only
with
the
movement
of
shadoof
or
is
not
buried
in
the
black
soil
fertilized
by
hapi
thus
can
inordinate
vanity
prolong
the
true
triumph
of
genius
and
impress
its
own
view
of
itself
upon
the
minds
of
millions
this
rameses
is
believed
to
be
the
pharaoh
who
oppressed
the
children
of
israel
as
i
sat
in
the
ramesseum
that
morning
i
recalled
his
face
the
face
of
an
artist
and
a
dreamer
rather
than
that
of
a
warrior
and
oppressor
asiatic
handsome
not
insensitive
not
cruel
but
subtle
aristocratic
and
refined
i
could
imagine
it
bending
above
the
little
serpents
of
the
sistrum
as
they
lifted
their
melodious
voices
to
bid
typhon
depart
or
watching
the
dancing
women
s
rhythmic
movements
or
smiling
half
kindly
half
with
irony
upon
the
lovelorn
maiden
who
made
her
plaint
what
is
sweet
to
the
mouth
to
me
is
as
the
gall
of
birds
thy
breath
alone
can
comfort
my
and
i
could
imagine
it
looking
profoundly
grave
not
sad
among
the
columns
with
their
opening
lotus
flowers
for
it
is
the
hall
of
lotus
columns
that
ibrahim
calls
the
of
the
king
there
is
something
both
lovely
and
touching
to
me
in
the
lotus
columns
of
egypt
in
the
tall
masses
of
stone
opening
out
into
flowers
near
the
sun
near
the
sun
yes
only
that
obvious
falsehood
will
convey
to
those
who
have
not
seen
them
the
effect
of
some
of
the
hypostyle
halls
the
columns
of
which
seem
literally
soaring
to
the
sky
and
flowers
of
stone
you
will
say
rudely
carved
and
rugged
that
does
not
matter
there
was
poetry
in
the
minds
that
conceived
them
in
the
thought
that
directed
the
hands
which
shaped
them
and
placed
them
where
they
are
in
egypt
perpetually
one
feels
how
the
ancient
egyptians
loved
the
which
is
the
white
lotus
and
the
the
lotus
that
is
blue
did
they
not
place
horus
in
its
cup
and
upon
the
head
of
the
nature
god
who
represented
in
their
mythology
the
heat
of
the
rising
sun
and
who
seems
to
have
been
credited
with
power
to
grant
life
in
the
world
to
come
set
it
as
a
sort
of
regal
ornament
to
seti
when
he
returned
in
glory
from
his
triumphs
over
the
syrians
were
given
bouquets
of
by
the
great
officers
of
his
household
the
tiny
column
of
green
feldspar
ending
in
the
lotus
typified
eternal
youth
even
as
the
carnelian
buckle
typified
the
blood
of
isis
which
washed
away
all
sin
kohl
pots
were
fashioned
in
the
form
of
the
lotus
cartouches
sprang
from
it
wine
flowed
from
cups
shaped
like
it
the
lotus
was
part
of
the
very
life
of
egypt
as
the
rose
the
american
beauty
rose
is
part
of
our
social
life
of
and
here
in
the
ramesseum
i
found
campaniform
or
capitals
on
the
columns
here
where
rameses
once
perhaps
dreamed
of
his
syrian
campaigns
or
of
that
famous
combat
when
like
baal
in
his
fury
he
fought
against
the
host
of
the
hittites
massed
in
two
thousand
five
hundred
chariots
to
overthrow
him
the
ramesseum
is
a
temple
not
of
winds
but
of
soft
and
kindly
airs
there
comes
zephyrus
whispering
love
to
flora
incarnate
in
the
lotus
to
every
sunbeam
to
every
little
breeze
the
ruins
stretch
out
arms
they
adore
the
sky
the
shining
sifted
sand
untrammeled
nature
all
that
whispers
so
i
felt
that
day
when
ibrahim
left
me
so
i
feel
always
when
i
sit
in
the
ramesseum
that
exultant
victim
of
time
s
here
not
sacrilegious
hand
all
strong
souls
cry
out
secretly
for
liberty
as
for
a
sacred
necessity
of
life
liberty
seems
to
drench
the
ramesseum
and
all
strong
souls
must
exult
there
the
sun
has
taken
it
as
a
beloved
possession
no
massy
walls
keep
him
out
no
battlements
rear
themselves
up
against
the
outer
world
as
at
no
huge
pylons
cast
down
upon
the
ground
their
forms
in
darkness
the
stone
glows
with
the
sun
seems
almost
to
have
a
soul
glowing
with
the
sense
the
sense
of
freedom
the
heart
leaps
up
in
the
ramesseum
not
frivolously
but
with
a
strange
sudden
knowledge
of
the
depths
of
passionate
joy
there
are
in
life
and
in
bountiful
glorious
nature
instead
of
the
strength
of
a
prison
one
feels
the
ecstasy
of
space
instead
of
the
safety
of
inclosure
the
rapture
of
naked
publicity
but
the
public
to
whom
this
place
of
the
great
king
is
consigned
is
a
public
of
theban
hills
of
the
sunbeams
striking
from
them
over
the
wide
world
toward
the
east
of
light
airs
of
drifting
sand
grains
of
singing
birds
and
of
butterflies
with
pure
white
wings
if
you
have
ever
ridden
an
arab
horse
mounted
in
the
heart
of
an
oasis
to
the
verge
of
the
great
desert
you
will
remember
the
bound
thrilling
with
fiery
animation
which
he
gives
when
he
sets
his
feet
on
the
sand
beyond
the
last
tall
a
bound
like
that
the
soul
gives
when
you
sit
in
the
ramesseum
and
see
the
crowding
sunbeams
the
groves
of
and
the
drowsy
mountains
like
shadows
that
sleep
beyond
the
nile
and
you
look
up
perhaps
as
i
looked
that
morning
and
upon
a
lotus
column
near
you
relieved
you
perceive
the
figure
of
a
young
man
singing
a
young
man
singing
let
him
be
the
tutelary
god
of
this
place
whoever
he
be
whether
only
some
humble
happy
slave
or
the
superintendent
of
song
and
of
the
recreation
of
the
rather
even
than
let
him
be
the
god
for
there
is
something
nobly
joyous
in
this
architecture
a
dignity
that
sings
it
has
been
said
but
not
established
that
rameses
the
great
was
buried
in
the
ramesseum
and
when
first
i
entered
it
the
lay
of
the
harper
came
to
my
mind
with
the
sadness
that
attends
the
passing
away
of
glory
into
the
shades
of
death
but
an
optimism
almost
as
determined
as
emerson
s
was
quickly
bred
in
me
there
i
could
not
be
sad
though
i
could
be
happily
thoughtful
in
the
light
of
the
ramesseum
and
even
when
i
left
the
and
coming
down
the
central
aisle
saw
in
the
immersing
sunshine
of
the
osiride
court
the
fallen
colossus
of
the
king
i
was
not
struck
to
sadness
imagine
the
greatest
figure
in
the
world
such
a
figure
as
this
rameses
was
in
his
day
with
all
might
all
glory
all
climbing
power
all
vigor
tenacity
of
purpose
and
granite
strength
of
will
concentrated
within
it
struck
suddenly
down
and
falling
backward
in
a
collapse
of
which
the
thunder
might
shake
the
vitals
of
the
earth
and
you
have
this
prostrate
colossus
even
now
one
seems
to
hear
it
fall
to
feel
the
warm
soil
trembling
beneath
one
s
feet
as
one
approaches
it
a
row
of
statues
of
enormous
size
with
arms
crossed
as
if
in
resignation
glowing
in
the
sun
in
color
not
gold
or
amber
but
a
delicate
desert
yellow
watch
near
it
like
servants
of
the
dead
on
a
slightly
lower
level
than
there
it
lies
and
a
little
nearer
the
nile
only
the
upper
half
of
the
figure
is
left
but
its
size
is
really
terrific
this
colossus
was
feet
high
it
weighed
eight
hundred
tons
eight
hundred
tons
of
syenite
went
to
its
making
and
across
the
shoulders
its
breadth
is
or
was
over
feet
but
one
does
not
think
of
measurements
as
one
looks
upon
it
it
is
stupendous
that
is
obvious
and
that
is
enough
nor
does
one
think
of
its
finish
of
its
beautiful
rich
color
of
any
of
its
details
one
thinks
of
it
as
a
tremendous
personage
laid
low
as
the
mightiest
of
the
mighty
fallen
one
thinks
of
it
as
the
dead
rameses
whose
glory
still
looms
over
egypt
like
a
golden
cloud
that
will
not
disperse
one
thinks
of
it
as
the
soul
that
commanded
and
lo
there
rose
up
above
the
sands
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
of
thebes
the
exultant
ramesseum
xii
place
for
queen
hatshepsu
surely
she
comes
to
a
sound
of
flutes
a
merry
noise
of
thin
bright
music
backed
by
a
clashing
of
barbaric
cymbals
along
the
corridors
of
the
past
this
queen
who
is
shown
upon
egyptian
walls
dressed
as
a
man
who
is
said
to
have
worn
a
beard
and
who
sent
to
the
land
of
punt
the
famous
expedition
which
covered
her
with
glory
and
brought
gold
to
the
god
amun
to
me
most
feminine
she
seemed
when
i
saw
her
temple
at
with
its
brightness
and
its
suavity
its
pretty
shallowness
and
sunshine
its
white
and
blue
and
yellow
and
red
and
green
and
orange
all
very
trim
and
fanciful
all
very
smart
and
delicate
full
of
finesse
and
laughter
and
breathing
out
to
me
of
the
twentieth
century
the
coquetry
of
a
woman
in
after
the
terrific
masculinity
of
after
the
great
freedom
of
the
ramesseum
and
the
grandeur
of
its
colossus
the
manhood
of
all
the
ages
concentrated
in
granite
the
temple
at
came
upon
me
like
a
delicate
woman
perfumed
and
arranged
clothed
in
a
creation
of
white
and
blue
and
orange
standing
ever
so
knowingly
against
a
background
of
orange
and
pink
of
red
and
of
a
smiling
coquette
of
the
mountain
a
gay
and
sweet
enchantress
who
knew
her
pretty
powers
and
meant
to
exercise
them
hatshepsu
with
a
beard
never
will
i
believe
it
or
if
she
ever
seemed
to
wear
one
i
will
swear
it
was
only
the
tattooed
ornament
with
which
all
the
lovely
women
of
the
fayum
decorate
their
chins
throwing
into
relief
the
smiling
soft
lips
the
delicate
noses
the
liquid
eyes
and
leading
one
from
it
step
by
step
to
the
beauties
it
precedes
wallis
budge
says
in
his
book
on
the
antiquities
of
egypt
it
would
be
unjust
to
the
memory
of
a
great
man
and
a
loyal
servant
of
hatshepsu
if
we
omitted
to
mention
the
name
of
senmut
the
architect
and
overseer
of
works
at
by
all
means
let
senmut
be
mentioned
and
then
let
him
be
utterly
forgotten
a
radiant
queen
reigns
here
a
queen
of
fantasy
and
splendor
and
of
that
divine
shallowness
refined
frivolity
literally
cut
into
the
mountain
which
is
the
note
of
and
what
a
clever
background
oh
hatshepsu
knew
what
she
was
doing
when
she
built
her
temple
here
it
was
not
the
solemn
senmut
he
wore
a
beard
i
m
sure
who
chose
that
background
if
i
know
anything
of
women
long
before
i
visited
i
had
looked
at
it
from
afar
my
eyes
had
been
drawn
to
it
merely
from
its
situation
right
underneath
the
mountains
i
had
asked
what
do
those
little
pillars
mean
and
are
those
little
doors
i
had
promised
myself
to
go
there
as
one
promises
oneself
a
to
finish
a
happy
banquet
and
i
had
realized
the
subtlety
essentially
feminine
that
had
placed
a
temple
there
and
s
temple
perhaps
you
say
was
it
not
there
before
the
queen
s
then
he
must
have
possessed
a
subtlety
purely
feminine
or
have
been
advised
by
one
of
his
wives
in
his
building
operations
or
by
some
favorite
female
slave
blundering
unsubtle
man
would
probably
think
that
the
best
way
to
attract
and
to
fix
attention
on
any
object
was
to
make
it
much
bigger
than
things
near
and
around
it
to
set
up
a
giant
among
dwarfs
not
so
queen
hatshepsu
more
artful
in
her
generation
she
set
her
long
but
little
temple
against
the
precipices
of
libya
and
what
is
the
result
simply
that
whenever
one
looks
toward
them
one
says
what
are
those
little
pillars
or
if
one
is
more
instructed
one
thinks
about
queen
hatshepsu
the
precipices
are
as
nothing
a
woman
s
wile
has
blotted
them
out
and
yet
how
grand
they
are
i
have
called
them
precipices
and
they
suggest
tawny
wild
beasts
fierce
bred
in
a
land
that
is
the
prey
of
the
sun
every
shade
of
orange
and
yellow
glows
and
grows
pale
on
their
bosses
in
their
clefts
they
shoot
out
turrets
of
rock
that
blaze
like
flames
in
the
day
they
show
great
teeth
like
the
tiger
when
any
one
draws
near
and
like
the
tiger
they
seem
perpetually
informed
by
a
spirit
that
is
angry
blake
wrote
of
the
tiger
tiger
tiger
burning
bright
in
the
forests
of
the
these
of
libya
are
burning
things
avid
like
beasts
of
prey
but
the
restored
pillars
are
not
afraid
of
their
impending
fury
fury
of
a
beast
baffled
by
a
tricky
little
woman
almost
it
seems
to
me
and
still
less
afraid
are
the
white
pillars
and
the
brilliant
paintings
that
decorate
the
walls
within
as
many
people
in
the
sad
but
lovely
islands
off
the
coast
of
scotland
believe
in
doubles
as
the
old
classic
writers
believed
in
man
s
genius
so
the
ancient
egyptian
believed
in
his
ka
or
separate
entity
a
sort
of
spiritual
other
self
to
be
propitiated
and
ministered
to
presented
with
gifts
and
served
with
energy
and
ardor
on
this
temple
of
is
the
scene
of
the
birth
of
hatshepsu
and
there
are
two
babies
the
princess
and
her
ka
for
this
imagined
ka
when
a
great
queen
long
after
she
built
this
temple
or
chapel
that
offerings
might
be
made
there
on
certain
appointed
days
fortunate
ka
of
hatshepsu
to
have
had
so
cheerful
a
dwelling
liveliness
pervades
i
remember
when
i
was
on
my
first
visit
to
egypt
lunching
at
thebes
with
monsieur
naville
and
hogarth
and
afterward
going
with
them
to
watch
the
digging
away
of
the
masses
of
sand
and
rubbish
which
concealed
this
gracious
building
i
remember
the
songs
of
the
workmen
toiling
and
sweating
in
the
sun
and
i
remember
seeing
a
white
temple
wall
come
up
into
the
light
with
all
the
painted
figures
surely
dancing
with
joy
upon
it
and
they
are
surely
dancing
still
here
you
may
see
brilliant
as
yesterday
s
picture
anywhere
fascinatingly
decorative
trees
growing
bravely
in
little
pots
red
people
offering
incense
which
is
piled
up
on
mounds
like
mountains
osiris
receiving
a
royal
gift
of
wine
the
queen
in
the
company
of
various
divinities
and
the
terrible
ordeal
of
the
cows
the
cows
are
being
weighed
in
scales
there
are
three
of
them
one
is
a
philosopher
and
reposes
with
an
air
that
says
even
this
last
indignity
of
being
weighed
against
my
will
can
not
perturb
my
soaring
but
the
other
two
sitting
up
look
as
apprehensive
as
old
ladies
in
a
rocking
express
expectant
of
an
accident
the
vividness
of
the
colors
in
this
temple
is
quite
wonderful
and
much
of
its
great
attraction
comes
rather
from
its
position
and
from
them
than
essentially
from
itself
at
what
the
long
shell
contains
its
happy
murmur
of
life
is
more
fascinating
than
the
shell
there
instead
of
being
uplifted
or
overawed
by
form
we
are
rejoiced
by
color
by
the
high
vivacity
of
arrested
movement
by
the
story
that
color
and
movement
tell
and
over
all
there
is
the
bright
blue
painted
sky
studded
almost
distractedly
studded
with
a
plethora
of
the
yellow
stars
the
egyptians
made
like
starfish
the
restored
columns
outside
look
unhappily
suburban
when
you
are
near
them
the
white
columns
with
their
architraves
are
more
pleasant
to
the
eyes
the
niches
full
of
bright
hues
the
arched
chapels
the
small
white
steps
leading
upward
to
shallow
sanctuaries
the
small
black
foxes
facing
each
other
on
little
yellow
pedestals
attract
one
like
the
details
and
amusing
ornaments
of
a
clever
woman
s
boudoir
through
this
most
characteristic
temple
one
roves
in
a
gaily
attentive
mood
feeling
all
the
time
hatshepsu
s
fascination
you
may
see
her
if
you
will
a
little
lady
on
the
wall
with
a
face
decidedly
sensual
a
long
straight
nose
thick
lips
an
expression
rather
determined
than
agreeable
her
mother
looks
as
semitic
as
a
jew
moneylender
in
brick
lane
london
her
husband
thothmes
has
a
weak
and
countenance
decidedly
an
accomplished
performer
on
the
second
violin
the
mother
wears
on
her
head
a
snake
no
doubt
a
the
symbol
of
her
sovereignty
thothmes
is
clad
in
a
and
a
god
with
a
sleepy
expression
and
a
very
head
appears
in
this
group
of
personages
to
offer
the
key
of
life
another
painting
of
the
queen
shows
her
on
her
knees
drinking
milk
from
the
sacred
cow
with
an
intent
and
greedy
figure
and
an
extraordinarily
sensual
and
expressive
face
that
she
was
well
guarded
is
surely
proved
by
a
brave
display
of
her
soldiers
red
men
on
a
white
wall
full
of
life
and
gaiety
all
in
a
row
they
come
holding
weapons
and
apparently
branches
and
advancing
with
a
gait
of
triumph
that
tells
of
spacious
and
at
their
head
is
an
officer
who
looks
back
much
like
a
modern
drill
sergeant
to
see
how
his
men
are
marching
in
the
southern
shrine
of
the
temple
cut
in
the
rock
as
is
the
northern
shrine
once
more
i
found
traces
of
the
lady
of
the
for
this
shrine
was
dedicated
to
hathor
though
the
whole
temple
was
sacred
to
the
theban
god
amun
upon
a
column
were
the
remains
of
the
goddess
s
face
with
a
broad
brow
and
long
large
eyes
some
fanatic
had
hacked
away
the
mouth
the
tomb
of
hatshepsu
was
found
by
theodore
davis
and
the
famous
of
by
monsieur
naville
as
lately
as
it
stands
in
the
museum
at
cairo
but
for
ever
it
will
be
connected
in
the
minds
of
men
with
the
precipices
and
the
colonnades
of
thebes
behind
the
ruins
of
the
temple
of
in
a
chapel
of
painted
rock
the
was
found
it
is
not
easy
to
convey
by
any
description
the
impression
this
marvellous
statue
makes
many
of
us
love
our
dogs
our
horses
some
of
us
adore
our
cats
but
which
of
us
can
think
without
a
smile
of
worshipping
a
cow
yet
the
cow
was
the
egyptian
aphrodite
s
sacred
animal
under
the
form
of
a
cow
she
was
often
represented
and
in
the
statue
she
is
presented
to
us
as
a
limestone
cow
and
positively
this
cow
is
to
be
worshipped
she
is
shown
in
the
act
apparently
of
stepping
gravely
forward
out
of
a
small
arched
shrine
the
walls
of
which
are
decorated
with
brilliant
paintings
her
color
is
red
and
yellowish
red
and
is
covered
with
dark
blotches
of
a
very
dark
green
which
look
almost
black
only
one
or
two
are
of
a
bluish
color
her
height
is
moderate
i
stand
about
five
foot
nine
and
i
found
that
on
her
pedestal
the
line
of
her
back
was
about
level
with
my
chest
the
lower
part
of
the
body
much
of
which
is
concealed
by
the
under
block
of
limestone
is
white
tinged
with
yellow
the
tail
is
red
above
the
head
open
and
closed
form
a
with
the
lunar
disk
and
two
feathers
and
the
long
flow
down
on
each
side
of
the
neck
toward
the
ground
at
the
back
of
this
are
a
scarab
and
a
cartouche
the
goddess
is
advancing
solemnly
and
gently
a
wonderful
calm
a
matchless
serene
dignity
enfold
her
in
the
body
of
this
cow
one
is
able
indeed
one
is
almost
obliged
to
feel
the
soul
of
a
goddess
the
incredible
is
accomplished
the
dead
egyptian
makes
the
ironic
the
skeptical
modern
world
feel
deity
in
a
limestone
cow
how
is
it
done
i
know
not
but
it
is
done
genius
can
do
nearly
everything
it
seems
under
the
chin
of
the
cow
there
is
a
standing
statue
of
the
king
and
beneath
her
the
king
kneels
as
a
boy
wonderfully
expressive
and
solemnly
refined
is
the
cow
s
face
which
is
of
dark
color
like
the
color
of
almost
black
earth
earth
fertilized
by
the
nile
dignified
dominating
almost
but
just
not
stern
strongly
intelligent
and
through
its
beautiful
intelligence
entirely
sympathetic
to
understand
all
is
to
pardon
all
this
face
once
thoroughly
seen
completely
noticed
can
never
be
forgotten
this
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
statues
in
the
world
when
i
was
at
i
thought
of
it
and
wished
that
it
still
stood
there
near
the
colonnades
of
thebes
under
the
precipices
and
then
i
thought
of
hatshepsu
surely
she
would
not
brook
a
rival
near
the
temple
which
she
made
a
rival
long
lost
and
long
forgotten
is
not
her
influence
still
there
upon
the
terraced
platforms
among
the
apricot
and
the
white
columns
near
the
paintings
of
the
land
of
punt
did
it
not
whisper
to
the
antiquaries
even
to
the
soldiers
from
cairo
who
guarded
the
in
the
night
to
make
haste
to
take
her
away
far
from
the
hills
of
thebes
and
from
the
nile
s
long
southern
reaches
that
the
great
queen
might
once
more
reign
alone
they
obeyed
hatshepsu
was
appeased
and
like
a
delicate
woman
perfumed
and
arranged
clothed
in
a
creation
of
white
and
blue
and
orange
standing
ever
so
knowingly
against
a
background
of
orange
and
pink
of
red
and
of
she
rules
at
xiii
the
tombs
of
the
kings
on
the
way
to
the
tombs
of
the
kings
i
went
to
the
temple
of
kurna
that
lonely
cenotaph
with
its
massive
façade
its
heaps
of
fallen
stone
its
wide
and
ruined
doorway
its
thick
almost
rough
columns
recalling
there
is
not
very
much
to
see
but
from
there
one
has
a
fine
view
of
other
temples
of
the
ramesseum
looking
superb
like
a
grand
skeleton
of
distant
very
pale
gold
in
the
morning
sunlight
of
little
the
pretty
child
of
the
ptolemies
with
the
heads
of
the
seven
hathors
and
from
kurna
the
colossi
are
exceptionally
grand
and
exceptionally
personal
so
personal
that
one
imagines
one
sees
the
expressions
of
the
faces
that
they
no
longer
possess
even
if
you
do
not
go
into
the
tombs
but
you
will
go
you
must
ride
to
the
tombs
of
the
kings
and
you
must
if
you
care
for
the
finesse
of
impressions
ride
on
a
blazing
day
and
toward
the
hour
of
noon
then
the
ravine
is
itself
like
the
great
act
that
demonstrates
a
temperament
it
is
the
narrow
home
of
fire
hemmed
in
by
brilliant
colors
nearly
all
perhaps
quite
all
of
which
could
be
found
in
a
glowing
furnace
every
shade
of
yellow
is
there
lemon
yellow
sulphur
yellow
the
yellow
of
amber
the
yellow
of
orange
with
its
tendency
toward
red
the
yellow
of
gold
sand
color
sun
color
can
not
all
these
yellows
be
found
in
a
fire
and
there
are
the
reds
pink
of
the
carnation
pink
of
the
coral
red
of
the
little
rose
that
grows
in
certain
places
of
sands
red
of
the
bright
flame
s
heart
and
all
these
colors
are
mingled
in
complete
sterility
and
all
are
fused
into
a
fierce
brotherhood
by
the
sun
and
like
a
flood
they
seem
flowing
to
the
red
and
the
yellow
mountains
like
a
flood
that
is
flowing
to
its
sea
you
are
taken
by
them
toward
the
mountains
on
and
on
till
the
world
is
closing
in
and
you
know
the
way
must
come
to
an
end
and
it
comes
to
an
end
in
a
tomb
you
go
to
a
door
in
the
rock
and
a
guardian
lets
you
in
and
wants
to
follow
you
in
prevent
him
if
you
can
pay
him
go
in
alone
for
this
is
the
tomb
of
amenhotep
ii
and
he
himself
is
here
far
down
at
rest
under
the
mountain
this
king
who
lived
and
reigned
more
than
fourteen
hundred
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
the
leads
to
him
and
you
should
go
to
him
alone
he
lies
in
the
heart
of
the
living
rock
in
the
dull
heat
of
the
earth
s
bowels
which
is
like
no
other
heat
you
descend
by
stairs
and
corridors
you
pass
over
a
well
by
a
bridge
you
pass
through
a
naked
chamber
and
the
king
is
not
there
and
you
go
on
down
another
staircase
and
along
another
corridor
and
you
come
into
a
pillared
chamber
with
paintings
on
its
walls
and
on
its
pillars
paintings
of
the
king
in
the
presence
of
the
gods
of
the
underworld
under
stars
in
a
soft
blue
sky
and
below
you
shut
in
on
the
farther
side
by
the
solid
mountain
in
whose
breast
you
have
all
this
time
been
walking
there
is
a
crypt
and
you
turn
away
from
the
bright
paintings
and
down
there
you
see
the
king
many
years
ago
in
london
i
went
to
the
private
view
of
the
royal
academy
at
burlington
house
i
went
in
the
afternoon
when
the
galleries
were
crowded
with
politicians
and
artists
with
dealers
gossips
quidnuncs
and
with
authors
fashionable
lawyers
and
doctors
with
men
and
women
of
the
world
with
young
dandies
and
actresses
a
roar
of
voices
went
up
to
the
roof
every
one
was
talking
smiling
laughing
commenting
and
criticizing
it
was
a
little
picture
of
the
very
worldly
world
that
loves
the
things
of
and
the
chime
of
the
passing
hours
and
suddenly
some
people
near
me
were
silent
and
some
turned
their
heads
to
stare
with
a
strangely
fixed
attention
and
i
saw
coming
toward
me
an
emaciated
figure
rather
bent
much
drawn
together
walking
slowly
on
legs
like
sticks
it
was
clad
in
black
with
a
gleam
of
color
above
it
was
a
face
so
intensely
thin
that
it
was
like
the
face
of
death
and
in
this
face
shone
two
eyes
that
seemed
full
of
the
other
world
and
like
a
breath
from
the
other
world
passing
this
man
went
by
me
and
was
hidden
from
me
by
the
throng
it
was
cardinal
manning
in
the
last
days
of
his
life
the
face
of
the
king
is
like
his
but
it
has
an
even
deeper
pathos
as
it
looks
upward
to
the
rock
and
the
king
s
silence
bids
you
be
silent
and
his
immobility
bids
you
be
still
and
his
sad
and
unutterable
resignation
sifts
awe
as
by
the
desert
wind
the
sand
is
sifted
into
the
temples
into
the
temple
of
your
heart
and
you
feel
the
touch
of
time
but
the
touch
of
eternity
too
and
as
in
that
sanctuary
you
whisper
you
say
it
for
all
the
world
xiv
edfu
prayer
pervades
the
east
far
off
across
the
sands
when
one
is
traveling
in
the
desert
one
sees
thin
minarets
rising
toward
the
sky
a
desert
city
is
there
it
signals
its
presence
by
this
mute
appeal
to
allah
and
where
there
are
no
minarets
in
the
great
wastes
of
the
dunes
in
the
eternal
silence
the
lifelessness
that
is
not
broken
even
by
any
lonely
wandering
bird
the
camels
are
stopped
at
the
appointed
hours
the
poor
and
often
ragged
robes
are
laid
down
the
brown
pilgrims
prostrate
themselves
in
prayer
and
the
rich
man
spreads
his
carpet
and
prays
and
the
nomad
spreads
nothing
but
he
prays
too
the
east
is
full
of
lust
and
full
of
and
full
of
bartering
and
full
of
violence
but
it
is
full
of
worship
of
worship
that
disdains
concealment
that
recks
not
of
ridicule
or
comment
that
believes
too
utterly
to
care
if
others
disbelieve
there
are
in
the
east
many
men
who
do
not
pray
they
do
not
laugh
at
the
man
who
does
like
the
unpraying
christian
there
is
nothing
ludicrous
to
them
in
prayer
in
egypt
your
nubian
sailor
prays
in
the
stern
of
your
dahabiyeh
and
your
egyptian
boatman
prays
by
the
rudder
of
your
boat
and
your
black
prays
behind
a
red
rock
in
the
sand
and
your
prays
when
you
are
resting
in
the
noontide
watching
the
quivering
mirage
lost
in
some
wayward
dream
and
must
you
not
pray
too
when
you
enter
certain
temples
where
once
strange
gods
were
worshipped
in
whom
no
man
now
believes
there
is
one
temple
on
the
nile
which
seems
to
embrace
in
its
arms
all
the
worship
of
the
past
to
be
full
of
prayers
and
solemn
praises
to
be
the
holder
the
noble
keeper
of
the
sacred
longings
of
the
unearthly
desires
and
aspirations
of
the
dead
it
is
the
temple
of
edfu
from
all
the
other
temples
it
stands
apart
it
is
the
temple
of
inward
flame
of
the
secret
soul
of
man
of
that
mystery
within
us
that
is
exquisitely
sensitive
and
exquisitely
alive
that
has
longings
it
can
not
tell
and
sorrows
it
dare
not
whisper
and
loves
it
can
only
love
to
horus
it
was
dedicated
horus
the
son
of
isis
and
osiris
who
was
crowned
with
many
crowns
who
was
the
young
apollo
of
the
old
egyptian
world
but
though
i
know
this
i
am
never
able
to
associate
edfu
with
horus
that
child
wearing
the
when
he
is
not
in
his
solar
aspect
that
boy
with
his
finger
in
his
mouth
that
youth
who
fought
against
set
murderer
of
his
father
edfu
in
its
solemn
beauty
in
its
perfection
of
form
seems
to
me
to
pass
into
a
region
altogether
beyond
identification
with
the
worship
of
any
special
deity
with
particular
attributes
perhaps
with
particular
limitations
one
who
can
be
graven
upon
walls
and
upon
architraves
and
pillars
painted
in
brilliant
colors
one
who
can
personally
pursue
a
criminal
like
some
policeman
in
the
street
even
one
who
can
rise
upon
the
world
in
the
visible
glory
of
the
sun
to
me
edfu
must
always
represent
the
of
the
hidden
one
not
amun
god
of
the
dead
fused
with
ra
with
amsu
or
with
khnum
but
that
other
hidden
one
who
is
god
of
the
happy
of
savages
with
whom
the
buddhist
strives
to
merge
his
strange
serenity
of
soul
who
is
adored
in
the
holy
places
by
the
moslem
and
lifted
mystically
above
the
heads
of
kneeling
catholics
in
cathedrals
dim
with
incense
and
merrily
praised
with
the
banjo
and
the
trumpet
in
the
streets
of
black
english
cities
who
is
asked
for
children
by
longing
women
and
for
new
dolls
by
lisping
babes
whom
the
atheist
denies
in
the
day
and
fears
in
the
darkness
of
night
who
is
on
the
lips
alike
of
priest
and
blasphemer
and
in
the
soul
of
all
human
life
edfu
stands
alone
not
near
any
other
temple
it
is
not
pagan
it
is
not
christian
it
is
a
place
in
which
to
worship
according
to
the
dictates
of
your
heart
edfu
stands
alone
on
the
bank
of
the
nile
between
luxor
and
assuan
it
is
not
very
far
from
once
the
capital
of
upper
egypt
and
it
is
about
two
thousand
years
old
the
building
of
it
took
over
one
hundred
and
eighty
years
and
it
is
the
most
perfectly
preserved
temple
of
all
the
antique
world
it
is
huge
and
it
is
splendid
it
has
towers
one
hundred
and
twelve
feet
high
a
propylon
two
hundred
and
feet
broad
and
walls
four
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
begun
in
the
reign
of
ptolemy
it
was
completed
only
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
you
know
these
facts
about
it
and
you
forget
them
or
at
least
you
do
not
think
of
them
what
does
it
all
matter
when
you
are
alone
in
edfu
let
the
antiquarian
go
with
his
anxious
nose
almost
touching
the
stone
let
the
egyptologist
peer
through
his
glasses
at
hieroglyphs
and
puzzle
out
the
meaning
of
cartouches
but
let
us
wander
at
ease
and
worship
and
regard
the
exquisite
form
and
drink
in
the
mystical
spirit
of
this
very
wonderful
temple
do
you
care
about
form
here
you
will
find
it
in
absolute
perfection
edfu
is
the
consecration
of
form
in
proportion
it
is
supreme
above
all
other
egyptian
temples
its
beauty
of
form
is
like
the
chiselled
loveliness
of
a
perfect
sonnet
while
the
world
lasts
no
architect
can
arise
to
create
a
building
more
satisfying
more
calm
with
the
calm
of
faultlessness
more
serene
with
a
just
serenity
or
so
it
seems
to
me
i
think
of
the
most
lovely
buildings
i
know
in
europe
of
the
alhambra
at
granada
of
the
cappella
palatina
in
the
palace
at
palermo
and
edfu
i
place
with
them
edfu
utterly
different
from
them
more
different
perhaps
even
than
they
are
from
each
other
but
akin
to
them
as
all
great
beauty
is
mysteriously
akin
i
have
spent
morning
after
morning
in
the
alhambra
and
many
and
many
an
hour
in
the
cappella
palatina
and
never
have
i
been
weary
of
either
or
longed
to
go
away
and
this
same
sweet
desire
to
stay
came
over
me
in
edfu
the
was
tied
up
by
the
high
bank
of
the
nile
the
sailors
were
glad
to
rest
there
was
no
steamer
sounding
its
hideous
siren
to
call
me
to
its
crowded
deck
so
i
yielded
to
my
desire
and
for
long
i
stayed
in
edfu
and
when
at
last
i
left
it
i
said
to
myself
this
is
a
supreme
thing
and
i
knew
that
within
me
had
suddenly
developed
the
curious
passion
for
buildings
that
some
people
never
feel
and
that
others
feel
ever
growing
and
growing
yes
edfu
is
supreme
no
alteration
could
improve
it
any
change
made
in
it
however
slight
could
only
be
harmful
to
it
pure
and
perfect
is
its
design
broad
propylon
great
open
courtyard
with
pillared
galleries
halls
chambers
sanctuary
its
dignity
and
its
sobriety
are
matchless
i
know
they
must
be
because
they
touched
me
so
strangely
with
a
kind
of
reticent
enchantment
and
i
am
not
by
nature
enamored
of
sobriety
of
reticence
and
calm
but
am
inclined
to
delight
in
almost
violent
force
in
brilliance
and
especially
in
combinations
of
color
in
the
alhambra
one
finds
both
force
and
fairylike
lightness
delicious
proportions
delicate
fantasy
a
spell
as
of
subtle
magicians
in
the
cappella
palatina
a
jeweled
splendor
combined
with
a
small
perfection
of
form
which
simply
captivates
the
whole
spirit
and
leads
it
to
adoration
in
edfu
you
are
face
to
face
with
hugeness
and
with
grandeur
but
soon
you
are
scarcely
aware
of
either
in
the
sense
at
least
that
connects
these
qualities
with
a
certain
overwhelming
almost
striking
down
of
the
spirit
and
the
faculties
what
you
are
aware
of
is
your
own
immense
and
beautiful
calm
of
utter
satisfaction
a
calm
which
has
quietly
inundated
you
like
a
waveless
tide
of
the
sea
how
rare
it
is
to
feel
this
absolute
satisfaction
this
praising
serenity
the
critical
spirit
goes
like
a
bird
from
an
opened
window
the
excited
laudatory
voluble
spirit
goes
and
this
splendid
calm
is
left
if
you
stay
here
you
as
this
temple
has
been
will
be
molded
into
a
beautiful
sobriety
from
the
top
of
the
pylon
you
have
received
this
still
and
glorious
impression
from
the
matchless
design
of
the
whole
building
which
you
see
best
from
there
when
you
descend
the
shallow
staircase
when
you
stand
in
the
great
court
when
you
go
into
the
shadowy
halls
then
it
is
that
the
utter
satisfaction
within
you
deepens
then
it
is
that
you
feel
the
need
to
worship
in
this
place
created
for
worship
the
ancient
egyptians
made
most
of
their
temples
in
conformity
with
a
single
type
the
sanctuary
was
at
the
heart
the
core
of
each
temple
the
sanctuary
surrounded
by
the
chambers
in
which
were
laid
up
the
precious
objects
connected
with
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
leading
to
this
core
of
the
temple
which
was
sometimes
called
the
divine
house
were
various
halls
the
roofs
of
which
were
supported
by
columns
those
hypostyle
halls
which
one
sees
perpetually
in
egypt
before
the
first
of
these
halls
was
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
a
colonnade
in
the
courtyard
the
priests
of
the
temple
assembled
the
people
were
allowed
to
enter
the
colonnade
a
gateway
with
towers
gave
entrance
to
the
courtyard
if
one
visits
many
of
the
egyptian
temples
one
soon
becomes
aware
of
the
subtlety
combined
with
a
sort
of
high
simplicity
and
sense
of
mystery
and
poetry
of
these
builders
of
the
past
as
a
great
writer
leads
one
on
with
a
concealed
but
beautiful
art
from
the
first
words
to
which
all
the
other
words
are
ministering
servants
as
the
great
musician
wagner
in
his
meistersinger
for
instance
leads
one
from
the
first
notes
of
his
score
to
those
final
notes
which
magnificently
reveal
to
the
listeners
the
real
meaning
of
those
first
notes
and
of
all
the
notes
which
follow
them
so
the
egyptian
builders
lead
the
spirit
gently
mysteriously
forward
from
the
gateway
between
the
towers
to
the
distant
house
divine
when
one
enters
the
outer
court
one
feels
the
sanctuary
almost
unconsciously
one
is
aware
that
for
that
sanctuary
all
the
rest
of
the
temple
was
created
that
to
that
sanctuary
everything
tends
and
in
spirit
one
is
drawn
softly
onward
to
that
very
holy
place
slowly
perhaps
the
body
moves
from
courtyard
to
hypostyle
hall
and
from
one
hall
to
another
hieroglyphs
are
examined
cartouches
puzzled
out
paintings
of
processions
or
of
pastimes
and
of
sacrifices
looked
at
with
care
and
interest
but
all
the
time
one
has
the
sense
of
waiting
of
a
want
unsatisfied
and
only
when
one
at
last
reaches
the
sanctuary
is
one
perfectly
at
rest
for
then
the
spirit
feels
this
is
the
meaning
of
it
one
of
the
means
which
the
egyptian
architects
used
to
create
this
sense
of
approach
is
very
simple
but
perfectly
effective
it
consisted
only
in
making
each
hall
on
a
very
slightly
higher
level
than
the
one
preceding
it
and
the
sanctuary
which
is
narrow
and
mysteriously
dark
on
the
highest
level
of
all
each
time
one
takes
an
upward
step
or
walks
up
a
little
incline
of
stone
the
body
seems
to
convey
to
the
soul
a
deeper
message
of
reverence
and
awe
in
no
other
temple
is
this
sense
of
approach
to
the
heart
of
a
thing
so
acute
as
it
is
when
one
walks
in
edfu
in
no
other
temple
when
the
sanctuary
is
reached
has
one
such
a
strong
consciousness
of
being
indeed
within
a
sacred
heart
the
color
of
edfu
is
a
pale
and
delicate
brown
warm
in
the
strong
sunshine
but
seldom
glowing
its
first
doorway
is
extraordinarily
high
and
is
narrow
but
very
deep
with
a
roof
showing
traces
of
that
delicious
clear
which
is
like
a
thin
cry
of
joy
rising
up
in
the
solemn
temples
of
egypt
a
small
sphinx
keeps
watch
on
the
right
just
where
the
guardian
stands
this
guardian
the
gift
of
the
past
squat
even
fat
with
a
very
perfect
face
of
a
determined
and
handsome
man
in
the
court
upon
a
pedestal
stands
a
big
bird
and
near
it
is
another
bird
or
rather
half
of
a
bird
leaning
forward
and
very
much
defaced
and
in
this
great
courtyard
there
are
swarms
of
living
birds
twittering
in
the
sunshine
through
the
doorway
between
the
towers
one
sees
a
glimpse
of
a
native
village
with
the
cupolas
of
a
mosque
i
stood
and
looked
at
the
cupolas
for
a
moment
then
i
turned
and
forgot
for
a
time
the
life
of
the
world
without
that
men
perhaps
were
praying
beneath
those
cupolas
or
praising
the
moslem
s
god
for
when
i
turned
i
felt
as
i
have
said
as
if
all
the
worship
of
the
world
must
be
concentrated
here
standing
far
down
the
open
court
in
the
full
sunshine
i
could
see
into
the
first
hypostyle
hall
but
beyond
only
a
darkness
a
darkness
which
led
me
on
in
which
the
further
chambers
of
the
house
divine
were
hidden
as
i
went
on
slowly
the
perfection
of
the
plan
of
the
dead
architects
was
gradually
revealed
to
me
when
the
darkness
gave
up
its
secrets
when
i
saw
not
clearly
but
dimly
the
long
way
between
the
columns
the
noble
columns
themselves
the
gradual
slight
upward
slope
graduated
by
genius
there
is
no
other
word
which
led
to
the
sanctuary
seen
at
last
as
a
little
darkness
in
which
all
the
mystery
of
worship
and
of
the
silent
desires
of
men
was
surely
concentrated
and
kept
by
the
stone
for
ever
even
the
succession
of
the
darknesses
like
shadows
growing
deeper
and
deeper
seemed
planned
by
some
great
artist
in
the
management
of
light
and
so
of
shadow
effects
the
perfection
of
form
is
in
edfu
impossible
to
describe
impossible
not
to
feel
the
tremendous
effect
it
has
an
effect
upon
the
soul
is
created
by
a
combination
of
shapes
of
proportions
of
different
levels
of
different
heights
by
consummate
graduation
and
these
shapes
proportions
different
levels
and
heights
are
seen
in
dimness
not
that
jewelled
dimness
one
loves
in
gothic
cathedrals
but
the
heavy
dimness
of
windowless
mighty
chambers
lighted
only
by
a
rebuked
daylight
ever
trying
to
steal
in
one
is
captured
by
no
ornament
seduced
by
no
lovely
colors
better
than
any
ornament
greater
than
any
radiant
glory
of
color
is
this
massive
austerity
it
is
like
the
ultimate
in
an
art
everything
has
been
tried
every
strangeness
absurdity
every
wild
scheme
of
hues
every
preposterous
subject
to
take
an
extreme
instance
a
camel
wearing
a
and
lighted
up
by
which
i
saw
recently
in
a
of
munich
and
at
the
end
a
genius
paints
a
portrait
of
a
wrinkled
old
woman
s
face
and
the
world
regards
and
worships
or
all
discords
have
been
flung
together
resolution
of
them
has
been
deferred
perpetually
perhaps
even
denied
altogether
chord
of
b
major
has
been
struck
with
c
major
works
have
closed
upon
the
leading
note
or
the
dominant
seventh
symphonies
have
been
composed
to
be
played
in
the
dark
or
to
be
accompanied
by
a
s
efforts
operas
been
produced
which
are
merely
carnage
and
a
row
and
at
the
end
a
genius
writes
a
little
song
and
the
world
gives
the
tribute
of
its
breathless
silence
and
its
tears
and
it
knows
that
though
other
things
may
be
done
better
things
can
never
be
done
for
no
perfection
can
exceed
any
other
perfection
and
so
in
edfu
i
feel
that
this
untinted
austerity
is
perfect
that
whatever
may
be
done
in
architecture
during
future
ages
of
the
world
edfu
while
it
lasts
will
remain
a
thing
supreme
supreme
in
form
and
because
of
this
supremacy
supreme
in
the
spell
which
it
casts
upon
the
soul
the
sanctuary
is
just
a
small
beautifully
proportioned
inmost
chamber
with
a
black
roof
containing
a
sort
of
altar
of
granite
and
a
great
polished
granite
shrine
which
no
doubt
once
contained
the
god
horus
i
am
glad
he
is
not
there
now
how
far
more
impressive
it
is
to
stand
in
an
empty
sanctuary
in
the
house
divine
of
the
hidden
one
whom
the
nations
of
the
world
worship
whether
they
spread
their
robes
on
the
sand
and
turn
their
faces
to
mecca
or
beat
the
tambourine
and
sing
glory
hymns
of
salvation
or
flagellate
themselves
in
the
night
before
the
patron
saint
of
the
passionists
or
only
gaze
at
the
plume
that
floats
from
the
snows
of
etna
under
the
rose
of
dawn
and
feel
the
soul
behind
nature
among
the
temples
of
egypt
edfu
is
the
house
divine
of
the
hidden
one
the
perfect
temple
of
worship
xv
kom
ombos
some
people
talk
of
the
sameness
of
the
nile
and
there
is
a
lovely
sameness
of
golden
light
of
delicious
air
of
people
and
of
scenery

all
mainly
a

i

there
is
a
sameness
a
sort
of
golden
monotony
in
this
land
pervaded
with
light
and
pervaded
with
sound
always
there
is
light
around
you
and
you
are
bathing
in
it

nearly
always
if
you
are
living
as
i
was
on
the
water
there
is
a
multitude
of
mingling
sounds
floating
floating
to
your
ears
as
there
are
two
lines
of
green
land
two
lines
of
mountains
following
the
course
of
the
nile
so
are
there
two
lines
of
voices
that
cease
their
calling
and
their
singing
only
as
you
draw
near
to
nubia
for
then
with
the
green
land
they
fade
away
these
miles
upon
miles
of
calling
and
singing
brown
men
and
amber
and
ruddy
sands
creep
downward
to
the
nile
and
the
air
seems
subtly
changing
and
the
light
perhaps
growing
a
little
harder
and
you
are
aware
of
other
regions
unlike
those
you
are
leaving
more
african
more
savage
less
suave
less
like
a
dreaming
and
especially
the
silence
makes
a
great
impression
on
you
but
before
you
enter
this
silence
between
the
amber
and
ruddy
walls
that
will
lead
you
on
to
nubia
and
to
the
land
of
the
crocodile
you
have
a
visit
to
pay
for
here
high
up
on
a
terrace
looking
over
a
great
bend
of
the
river
is
kom
ombos
and
kom
ombos
is
the
temple
of
the
crocodile
god
sebek
was
one
of
the
oldest
and
one
of
the
most
evil
of
the
egyptian
gods
in
the
fayum
he
was
worshipped
as
well
as
at
kom
ombos
and
there
in
the
holy
lake
of
his
temple
were
numbers
of
holy
crocodiles
which
strabo
tells
us
were
decorated
with
jewels
like
pretty
women
he
did
not
get
on
with
the
other
gods
and
was
sometimes
confused
with
set
who
personified
natural
darkness
and
who
also
was
worshipped
by
the
people
about
kom
ombos
i
have
spoken
of
the
golden
sameness
of
the
nile
but
this
sameness
is
broken
by
the
variety
of
the
temples
here
you
have
a
striking
instance
of
this
variety
edfu
only
forty
miles
from
kom
ombos
the
next
temple
which
you
visit
is
the
most
perfect
temple
in
egypt
kom
ombos
is
one
of
the
most
imperfect
edfu
is
a
divine
house
of
the
hidden
one
full
of
a
sacred
atmosphere
kom
ombos
is
the
house
of
crocodiles
in
ancient
days
the
inhabitants
of
edfu
abhorred
above
everything
crocodiles
and
their
worshippers
and
here
at
kom
ombos
the
crocodile
was
adored
you
are
in
a
different
atmosphere
as
soon
as
you
land
you
are
greeted
with
crocodiles
though
fortunately
not
by
them
a
heap
of
their
black
mummies
is
shown
to
you
reposing
in
a
sort
of
tomb
or
shrine
open
at
one
end
to
the
air
by
these
mummies
the
new
note
is
loudly
struck
the
crocodiles
have
carried
you
in
an
instant
from
that
which
is
pervadingly
general
to
that
which
is
narrowly
particular
from
the
purely
noble
which
seems
to
belong
to
all
time
to
the
entirely
barbaric
which
belongs
only
to
times
outworn
it
is
difficult
to
feel
as
if
one
had
anything
in
common
with
men
who
seriously
worshipped
crocodiles
had
priests
to
feed
them
and
decorated
their
scaly
necks
with
jewels
yet
the
crocodile
god
had
a
noble
temple
at
kom
ombos
a
temple
which
dates
from
the
times
of
the
ptolemies
though
there
was
a
temple
in
earlier
days
which
has
now
disappeared
its
situation
is
splendid
it
stands
high
above
the
nile
and
close
to
the
river
on
a
terrace
which
has
recently
been
constructed
to
save
it
from
the
encroachments
of
the
water
and
it
looks
down
upon
a
view
which
is
exquisite
in
the
clear
light
of
early
morning
on
the
right
and
far
off
is
a
delicious
pink
bareness
of
distant
flats
and
hills
opposite
there
is
a
flood
of
verdure
and
of
trees
going
to
mountains
a
spit
of
sand
where
is
an
inlet
of
the
river
with
a
crowd
of
native
boats
perhaps
waiting
for
a
wind
on
the
left
is
the
big
bend
of
the
nile
singularly
beautiful
almost
voluptuous
in
form
and
girdled
with
a
radiant
green
of
crops
with
and
again
the
distant
hills
sebek
was
well
advised
to
have
his
temples
here
and
in
the
glorious
fayum
that
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
where
the
air
is
full
of
the
voices
of
the
flocks
and
herds
and
alive
with
the
wild
pigeons
where
the
sweet
towers
up
in
fairy
forests
the
beloved
home
of
the
jackal
where
the
green
corn
waves
to
the
horizon
and
the
runlets
of
water
make
a
maze
of
silver
threads
carrying
life
and
its
happy
murmur
through
all
the
vast
oasis
at
the
guardian
s
gate
by
which
you
go
in
there
sits
not
a
watch
dog
nor
yet
a
crocodile
but
a
watch
cat
small
but
very
determined
and
very
attentive
to
its
duties
and
neatly
carved
in
stone
you
try
to
look
like
a
it
is
deceived
and
lets
you
pass
and
you
are
alone
with
the
growing
morning
and
kom
ombos
i
was
never
taken
caught
up
into
an
atmosphere
in
kom
ombos
i
examined
it
with
interest
but
i
did
not
feel
a
spell
its
grandeur
is
great
but
it
did
not
affect
me
as
did
the
grandeur
of
karnak
its
nobility
can
not
be
questioned
but
i
did
not
stilly
rejoice
in
it
as
in
the
nobility
of
luxor
or
the
free
splendor
of
the
ramesseum
the
oldest
thing
at
kom
ombos
is
a
gateway
of
sandstone
placed
there
by
thothmes
iii
as
a
tribute
to
sebek
the
great
temple
is
of
a
color
a
very
rich
and
particularly
beautiful
brown
that
soothes
and
almost
comforts
the
eyes
that
have
been
for
many
days
boldly
assaulted
by
the
sun
upon
the
terrace
platform
above
the
river
you
face
a
low
and
ruined
wall
on
which
there
are
some
lively
reliefs
beyond
which
is
a
large
open
court
containing
a
quantity
of
stunted
once
big
columns
standing
on
big
bases
immediately
before
you
the
temple
towers
up
very
gigantic
very
majestic
with
a
stone
pavement
walls
on
which
still
remain
some
traces
of
paintings
and
really
grand
columns
enormous
in
size
and
in
good
formation
there
are
fine
architraves
and
some
bits
of
roofing
but
the
greater
part
is
open
to
the
air
through
a
doorway
is
a
second
hall
containing
columns
much
less
noble
and
beyond
this
one
walks
in
ruin
among
crumbled
or
partly
destroyed
chambers
broken
statues
become
mere
slabs
of
granite
and
fallen
blocks
of
stone
at
the
end
is
a
wall
with
a
pavement
bordering
it
and
a
row
of
chambers
that
look
like
monkish
cells
closed
by
small
doors
at
kom
ombos
there
are
two
sanctuaries
one
dedicated
to
sebek
the
other
to
or
haroeris
a
form
of
horus
in
egyptian
called
the
elder
which
was
worshipped
with
sebek
here
by
the
admirers
of
crocodiles
each
of
them
contains
a
pedestal
of
granite
upon
which
once
rested
a
sacred
bark
bearing
an
image
of
the
deity
there
are
some
fine
reliefs
scattered
through
these
mighty
ruins
showing
sebek
with
the
head
of
a
crocodile
with
the
head
of
a
hawk
so
characteristic
of
horus
and
one
strange
animal
which
has
no
fewer
than
four
heads
apparently
meant
for
the
heads
of
lions
one
relief
which
i
specially
noticed
for
its
life
its
charming
vivacity
and
its
almost
amusing
fidelity
to
details
unchanged
depicts
a
number
of
ducks
in
full
flight
near
a
mass
of
i
remembered
it
one
day
in
the
fayum
so
intimately
associated
with
sebek
when
i
rode
twenty
miles
out
from
camp
on
a
dromedary
to
the
end
of
the
great
lake
of
kurun
where
the
sand
wastes
of
the
libyan
desert
stretch
to
the
pale
and
waveless
waters
which
that
day
looked
curiously
desolate
and
even
sinister
under
a
low
grey
sky
beyond
the
wiry
which
grow
far
out
from
the
shore
thousands
upon
thousands
of
wild
duck
were
floating
as
far
as
the
eyes
could
see
we
took
a
strange
native
boat
manned
by
two
fishermen
and
were
rowed
with
big
oars
out
upon
the
silent
flood
that
the
silent
desert
surrounded
but
the
duck
were
too
wary
ever
to
let
us
get
within
range
of
them
as
we
drew
gently
near
they
rose
in
black
throngs
and
skimmed
low
into
the
distance
of
the
wintry
landscape
trailing
their
legs
behind
them
like
the
duck
on
the
wall
of
kom
ombos
there
was
no
duck
for
dinner
in
camp
that
night
and
the
cook
was
inconsolable
but
i
had
seen
a
relief
come
to
life
and
surmounted
my
disappointment
kom
ombos
and
edfu
the
two
houses
of
the
lovers
and
haters
of
crocodiles
or
at
least
of
the
lovers
and
the
haters
of
their
worship
i
shall
always
think
of
them
together
because
i
drifted
on
the
from
one
to
the
other
and
saw
no
interesting
temple
between
them
and
because
their
personalities
are
as
opposed
as
were
centuries
ago
the
tenets
of
those
who
adored
within
them
the
egyptians
of
old
were
devoted
to
the
hunting
of
crocodiles
which
once
abounded
in
the
reaches
of
the
nile
between
assuan
and
luxor
and
also
much
lower
down
but
i
believe
that
no
reliefs
or
paintings
of
this
sport
are
to
be
found
upon
the
walls
of
the
temples
and
the
tombs
the
fear
of
sebek
perhaps
prevailed
even
over
the
dwellers
about
the
temple
of
edfu
yet
how
could
fear
of
any
crocodile
god
infect
the
souls
of
those
who
were
privileged
to
worship
in
such
a
temple
or
even
reverently
to
stand
under
the
colonnade
within
the
door
as
well
perhaps
one
might
ask
how
men
could
be
inspired
to
raise
such
a
perfect
building
to
a
deity
with
the
face
of
a
hawk
but
horus
was
not
the
god
of
crocodiles
but
a
god
of
the
sun
and
his
power
to
inspire
men
must
have
been
vast
for
the
greatest
concentration
in
stone
in
egypt
and
i
suppose
in
the
whole
world
the
sphinx
as
de
rouge
proved
by
an
inscription
at
edfu
was
a
representation
of
horus
transformed
to
conquer
typhon
the
sphinx
and
edfu
for
such
marvels
we
ought
to
bless
the
god
and
if
we
forget
the
hawk
which
one
meets
so
perpetually
upon
the
walls
of
tombs
and
temples
and
identify
horus
rather
with
the
greek
apollo
the
god
of
the
sun
driving
westerly
all
day
in
his
flaming
chariot
and
shooting
his
golden
arrows
at
the
happy
world
beneath
we
can
be
at
peace
with
those
dead
egyptians
for
every
pilgrim
who
goes
to
edfu
is
surely
a
worshipper
of
the
solar
aspect
of
horus
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
there
will
be
every
brown
man
upon
the
nile
is
one
and
every
good
american
who
crosses
the
ocean
and
comes
at
last
into
the
sombre
wonder
of
edfu
and
i
was
one
upon
the
deck
of
the
and
we
all
worship
as
yet
in
the
dark
as
in
the
exquisite
dark
like
faith
of
the
holy
of
holies
of
horus
xvi
philae
as
i
drew
slowly
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
home
of
the
great
enchantress
or
as
isis
was
also
called
in
bygone
days
the
lady
of
philae
the
land
began
to
change
in
character
to
be
full
of
a
new
and
barbaric
meaning
in
recent
years
i
have
paid
many
visits
to
northern
africa
but
only
to
tunisia
and
algeria
countries
that
are
wilder
looking
and
much
wilder
seeming
than
egypt
now
as
i
approached
assuan
i
seemed
at
last
to
be
also
approaching
the
real
the
intense
africa
that
i
had
known
in
the
sahara
the
enigmatic
siren
savage
and
strange
and
wonderful
whom
the
typical
ouled
nail
crowned
with
gold
and
tufted
with
ostrich
plumes
painted
with
kohl
tattooed
and
perfumed
hung
with
golden
coins
and
amulets
and
framed
in
plaits
of
coarse
false
hair
represents
indifferently
to
the
eyes
of
the
travelling
stranger
for
at
last
i
saw
the
sands
that
i
love
creeping
down
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
they
brought
with
them
that
wonderful
air
which
belongs
only
to
them
the
air
that
dwells
among
the
dunes
in
the
solitary
places
that
is
like
the
cool
touch
of
liberty
upon
the
face
of
a
man
that
makes
the
brown
child
of
the
nomad
as
lithe
tireless
and
as
a
young
panther
and
sets
flame
in
the
eyes
of
the
arab
horse
and
gives
speed
of
the
wind
to
the
sloughi
the
true
lover
of
the
desert
can
never
rid
his
soul
of
its
passion
for
the
sands
and
now
my
heart
leaped
as
i
stole
into
their
pure
embraces
as
i
saw
to
right
and
left
amber
curves
and
sheeny
recesses
shining
ridges
and
bloomy
clefts
the
clean
delicacy
of
those
sands
that
in
long
and
glowing
hills
stretched
out
from
nubia
to
meet
me
who
could
ever
describe
them
who
could
ever
describe
their
soft
and
enticing
shapes
their
exquisite
gradations
of
color
the
little
shadows
in
their
hollows
the
fiery
beauty
of
their
crests
the
patterns
the
cool
winds
make
upon
them
it
is
an
enchanted
of
the
sands
through
which
one
approaches
isis
isis
and
engineers
we
english
people
have
effected
that
curious
introduction
and
we
greatly
pride
ourselves
upon
it
we
have
presented
sir
william
garstin
and
john
blue
and
fitz
maurice
and
other
clever
men
to
the
fabled
lady
of
philae
and
they
have
given
her
a
gift
a
dam
two
thousand
yards
in
length
upon
which
tourists
go
smiling
on
trolleys
isis
has
her
expensive
tribute
it
cost
about
a
million
and
a
half
pounds
and
no
doubt
she
ought
to
be
gratified
yet
i
think
isis
mourns
on
altered
philae
as
she
mourns
with
her
sister
nepthys
at
the
heads
of
so
many
mummies
of
osirians
upon
the
walls
of
egyptian
tombs
and
though
the
fellaheen
very
rightly
rejoice
there
are
some
unpractical
sentimentalists
who
form
a
company
about
her
and
make
their
plaint
with
hers
their
plaint
for
the
peace
that
is
gone
for
the
lost
calm
the
departed
poetry
that
once
hung
like
a
delicious
like
an
inimitable
atmosphere
about
the
palms
of
the
holy
i
confess
that
i
dreaded
to
revisit
philae
i
had
sweet
memories
of
the
island
that
had
been
with
me
for
many
years
memories
of
still
mornings
under
the
watching
the
gliding
waters
of
the
river
or
gazing
across
them
to
the
long
sweep
of
the
empty
sands
memories
of
drowsy
golden
noons
when
the
bright
world
seemed
softly
sleeping
and
the
almost
temple
dreamed
under
the
quivering
canopy
of
blue
memories
of
evenings
when
a
benediction
from
the
lifted
hands
of
romance
surely
fell
upon
the
temple
and
the
island
and
the
river
memories
of
moonlit
nights
when
the
spirits
of
the
old
gods
to
whom
the
temples
were
reared
surely
held
converse
with
the
spirits
of
the
desert
with
mirage
and
her
pale
and
evading
sisters
of
the
great
spaces
under
the
brilliant
stars
i
was
afraid
because
i
could
not
believe
the
asservations
of
certain
practical
persons
full
of
the
hard
and
almost
angry
desire
of
progress
that
no
harm
had
been
done
by
the
creation
of
the
reservoir
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
had
benefited
the
temple
the
action
of
the
water
upon
the
stone
they
said
with
vehement
voices
instead
of
loosening
it
and
causing
it
to
crumble
untimely
away
had
tended
to
harden
and
consolidate
it
here
i
should
like
to
lie
but
i
resist
the
temptation
monsieur
naville
has
stated
that
possibly
the
english
engineers
have
helped
to
prolong
the
lives
of
the
buildings
of
philae
and
monsieur
maspero
has
declared
that
the
state
of
the
temple
of
philae
becomes
continually
more
so
be
it
longevity
has
been
by
a
happy
chance
secured
but
what
of
beauty
what
of
the
beauty
of
the
past
and
what
of
the
schemes
for
the
future
is
philae
even
to
be
left
as
it
is
or
are
the
waters
of
the
nile
to
be
artificially
raised
still
higher
until
philae
ceases
to
be
soon
no
doubt
an
answer
will
be
given
meanwhile
instead
of
the
little
island
that
i
knew
and
thought
a
little
paradise
breathing
out
enchantment
in
the
midst
of
titanic
sterility
i
found
a
something
diseased
philae
now
when
out
of
the
water
as
it
was
all
the
time
when
i
was
last
in
egypt
looks
like
a
thing
stricken
with
some
creeping
malady
one
of
those
maladies
which
begin
in
the
lower
members
of
a
body
and
work
their
way
gradually
but
inexorably
upward
to
the
trunk
until
they
attain
the
heart
i
came
to
it
by
the
desert
and
descended
to
shellal
shellal
with
its
its
workmen
s
buildings
its
tents
its
dozens
of
screens
to
protect
the
hewers
of
stone
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
its
bustle
of
people
of
overseers
engineers
and
workmen
egyptian
nubian
italian
and
greek
the
silence
i
had
known
was
gone
though
the
desert
lay
all
around
the
great
sands
the
great
masses
of
granite
that
look
as
if
patiently
waiting
to
be
fashioned
into
obelisks
and
sarcophagi
and
statues
but
away
there
across
the
bend
of
the
river
dominating
the
ugly
rummage
of
this
intrusive
beehive
of
human
bees
sheer
grace
overcoming
strength
both
of
nature
and
human
nature
rose
the
fabled
pharaoh
s
bed
gracious
tender
from
shellal
most
delicately
perfect
and
glowing
with
pale
gold
against
the
grim
background
of
the
hills
on
the
western
shore
it
seemed
to
plead
for
mercy
like
something
feminine
threatened
with
outrage
to
protest
through
its
mere
beauty
as
a
woman
might
protest
by
an
attitude
against
further
desecration
and
in
the
distance
the
nile
roared
through
the
many
gates
of
the
dam
making
answer
to
the
protest
what
irony
was
in
this
scene
in
the
old
days
of
egypt
philae
was
sacred
ground
was
the
home
of
sacerdotal
mysteries
was
a
veritable
mecca
to
the
believers
in
osiris
to
which
it
was
forbidden
even
to
draw
near
without
permission
the
ancient
egyptians
swore
solemnly
by
him
who
sleeps
in
now
they
sometimes
swear
angrily
at
him
who
wakes
in
or
at
least
by
philae
and
keeps
them
steadily
going
at
their
appointed
tasks
and
instead
of
it
being
forbidden
to
draw
near
to
a
sacred
spot
needy
men
from
foreign
countries
flock
thither
in
eager
crowds
not
to
worship
in
beauty
but
to
earn
a
living
wage
and
pharaoh
s
bed
looks
out
over
the
water
and
seems
to
wonder
what
will
be
the
end
i
was
glad
to
escape
from
shellal
pursued
by
the
shriek
of
an
engine
announcing
its
departure
from
the
station
glad
to
be
on
the
quiet
water
to
put
it
between
me
and
that
crowd
of
busy
workers
before
me
i
saw
a
vast
lake
not
unlovely
where
once
the
nile
flowed
swiftly
far
off
a
grey
smudge
the
very
damnable
dam
all
around
me
was
a
grim
and
cruel
world
of
rocks
and
of
hills
that
look
almost
like
heaps
of
rubbish
some
of
them
grey
some
of
them
in
color
so
dark
that
they
resemble
the
lava
torrents
petrified
near
catania
or
the
black
country
in
england
through
which
one
rushes
on
one
s
way
to
the
north
just
here
and
there
sweetly
almost
as
the
pink
blossoms
of
the
wild
oleander
which
i
have
seen
from
sicilian
seas
lifting
their
heads
from
the
crevices
of
sea
rocks
the
amber
and
rosy
sands
of
nubia
smiled
down
over
grit
stone
and
granite
the
setting
of
philae
is
severe
even
in
bright
sunshine
it
has
an
iron
look
on
a
grey
or
stormy
day
it
would
be
forbidding
or
even
terrible
in
the
old
winters
and
springs
one
loved
philae
the
more
because
of
the
contrast
of
its
setting
with
its
own
lyrical
beauty
its
curious
tenderness
of
charm
a
charm
in
which
the
isle
itself
was
mingled
with
its
buildings
but
now
and
before
my
boat
had
touched
the
quay
i
saw
that
the
island
must
be
ignored
if
possible
the
water
with
which
it
is
entirely
covered
during
a
great
part
of
the
year
seems
to
have
cast
a
blight
upon
it
the
very
few
palms
have
a
drooping
and
tragic
air
the
ground
has
a
gangrened
appearance
and
much
of
it
shows
a
crawling
mass
of
plants
which
seem
crouching
down
as
if
ashamed
of
their
brutal
exposure
by
the
receded
river
and
of
harsh
and
grass
unattractive
to
the
eyes
as
i
stepped
on
shore
i
felt
as
if
i
were
stepping
on
disease
but
at
least
there
were
the
buildings
undisturbed
by
any
outrage
again
i
turned
toward
pharaoh
s
bed
toward
the
temple
standing
apart
from
it
which
already
i
had
seen
from
the
desert
near
shellal
gleaming
with
its
gracious
lifting
its
series
of
straight
lines
of
masonry
above
the
river
and
the
rocks
looking
from
a
distance
very
simple
with
a
simplicity
like
that
of
clear
water
but
as
enticing
as
the
light
on
the
first
real
day
of
spring
i
went
first
to
pharaoh
s
imagine
a
woman
with
a
perfectly
lovely
face
with
features
as
exquisitely
proportioned
as
those
say
of
praxiteles
s
statue
of
the
cnidian
aphrodite
for
which
king
nicomedes
was
willing
to
remit
the
entire
national
debt
of
cnidus
and
with
a
warmly
white
complexion
one
of
those
complexions
one
sometimes
sees
in
italian
women
colorless
yet
suggestive
almost
of
glow
of
purity
with
the
flame
of
passion
behind
it
imagine
that
woman
attacked
by
a
malady
which
leaves
her
features
exactly
as
they
were
but
which
changes
the
color
of
her
face
from
the
throat
upward
to
just
beneath
the
nose
from
the
warm
white
to
a
mottled
greyish
hue
imagine
the
line
that
would
seem
to
be
traced
between
the
two
complexions
the
mottled
grey
below
the
warm
white
still
glowing
above
imagine
this
and
you
have
pharaoh
s
bed
and
the
temple
of
philae
as
they
are
xvii
pharaoh
s
bed
pharaoh
s
bed
which
stands
alone
close
to
the
nile
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
island
is
not
one
of
those
rugged
majestic
buildings
full
of
grandeur
and
splendor
which
can
bear
can
carry
off
as
it
were
a
cruelly
imposed
ugliness
without
being
affected
as
a
whole
it
is
on
the
contrary
a
small
almost
an
airy
and
a
femininely
perfect
thing
in
which
a
singular
loveliness
of
form
was
combined
with
a
singular
loveliness
of
color
the
spell
it
threw
over
you
was
not
so
much
a
spell
woven
of
details
as
a
spell
woven
of
divine
uniformity
to
put
it
in
very
practical
language
pharaoh
s
bed
was
all
of
a
the
form
was
married
to
the
color
the
color
seemed
to
melt
into
the
form
it
was
indeed
a
bed
in
which
the
soul
that
worships
beauty
could
rest
happily
entranced
nothing
jarred
antiquaries
say
that
apparently
this
building
was
left
unfinished
that
may
be
so
but
for
all
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
finished
things
in
egypt
essentially
a
thing
to
inspire
within
one
the
perfect
calm
that
is
the
blighting
touch
of
the
nile
which
has
changed
the
beautiful
pale
yellow
of
the
stone
of
the
lower
part
of
the
building
to
a
hideous
and
dreary
grey
which
made
me
think
of
a
steel
knife
on
which
liquid
has
been
spilt
and
allowed
to
run
has
destroyed
the
uniformity
the
balance
the
faultless
melody
lifted
up
by
form
and
color
and
so
it
is
with
the
temple
it
is
as
it
were
cut
in
two
by
the
intrusion
into
it
of
this
hideous
mottled
complexion
left
by
the
receded
water
everywhere
one
sees
disease
on
the
walls
and
columns
almost
blotting
out
giving
to
their
active
figures
a
morbid
a
sickly
look
the
effect
is
specially
distressing
in
the
open
court
that
precedes
the
temple
dedicated
to
the
lady
of
philae
in
this
court
which
is
at
the
southern
end
of
the
island
the
nile
at
certain
seasons
is
now
forced
to
rise
very
nearly
as
high
as
the
capitals
of
many
of
the
columns
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
here
the
disease
seems
making
rapid
strides
one
feels
it
is
drawing
near
to
the
heart
and
that
the
poor
doomed
invalid
may
collapse
at
any
moment
yes
there
is
much
to
make
one
sad
at
philae
but
how
much
of
pure
beauty
there
is
left
of
beauty
that
merely
protests
against
any
further
outrage
as
there
is
something
epic
in
the
grandeur
of
the
lotus
hall
at
karnak
so
there
is
something
lyrical
in
the
soft
charm
of
the
philae
temple
certain
things
or
places
certain
things
in
certain
places
always
suggest
to
my
mind
certain
people
in
whose
genius
i
take
delight
who
have
won
me
and
moved
me
by
their
art
whenever
i
go
to
philae
the
name
of
shelley
comes
to
me
i
scarcely
could
tell
why
i
have
no
special
reason
to
connect
shelley
with
philae
but
when
i
see
that
almost
airy
loveliness
of
stone
so
simply
elegant
so
somehow
in
its
beauty
its
happy
daffodil
charm
with
its
touch
of
the
greek
the
sensitive
hand
from
attica
stretched
out
over
nubia
i
always
think
of
shelley
i
think
of
shelley
the
youth
who
dived
down
into
the
pool
so
deep
that
it
seemed
he
was
lost
for
ever
to
the
sun
i
think
of
shelley
the
poet
full
of
a
lyric
ecstasy
who
was
himself
like
an
embodied
longing
for
something
afar
from
the
sphere
of
our
lyrical
philae
is
like
a
temple
of
dreams
and
of
all
poets
shelley
might
have
dreamed
the
dream
and
have
told
it
to
the
world
in
a
song
for
all
its
solidity
there
are
a
strange
lightness
and
grace
in
the
temple
of
philae
there
is
an
elegance
you
will
not
find
in
the
other
temples
of
egypt
but
it
is
an
elegance
quite
undefiled
by
weakness
by
any
sentimentality
even
a
building
like
a
maid
can
be
sentimental
edward
fitzgerald
once
defined
taste
as
the
feminine
of
genius
taste
prevails
in
philae
a
certain
delicious
femininity
that
seduces
the
eyes
and
the
heart
of
man
shall
we
call
it
the
spirit
of
isis
i
have
heard
a
clever
critic
and
antiquarian
declare
that
he
is
not
very
fond
of
philae
that
he
feels
a
certain
spuriousness
in
the
temple
due
to
the
mingling
of
greek
with
egyptian
influences
he
may
be
right
i
am
no
antiquarian
and
as
a
mere
lover
of
beauty
i
do
not
feel
this
i
can
see
neither
two
quarrelling
strengths
nor
any
weakness
caused
by
division
i
suppose
i
see
only
the
beauty
as
i
might
see
only
the
beauty
of
a
women
bred
of
a
handsome
father
and
mother
of
different
races
and
who
not
typical
of
either
combined
in
her
features
and
figure
distinguishing
merits
of
both
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
particular
pleasure
which
is
roused
in
us
only
by
the
absolutely
typical
the
completely
thoroughbred
person
or
thing
it
may
be
a
pleasure
not
caused
by
beauty
and
it
may
be
very
keen
nevertheless
when
it
is
combined
with
the
joy
roused
in
us
by
all
beauty
it
is
a
very
pure
emotion
of
exceptional
delight
philae
does
not
perhaps
give
this
emotion
but
it
certainly
has
a
lovableness
that
attaches
the
heart
in
a
quite
singular
degree
the
is
the
most
faithful
of
lovers
the
hold
of
his
mistress
upon
him
once
it
has
been
felt
is
never
relaxed
and
in
his
affection
for
philae
there
is
i
think
nearly
always
a
rainbow
strain
of
romance
when
we
love
anything
we
love
to
be
able
to
say
of
the
object
of
our
devotion
there
is
nothing
like
now
in
all
egypt
and
i
suppose
in
all
the
world
there
is
nothing
just
like
philae
there
are
temples
yes
but
where
else
is
there
a
bouquet
of
gracious
buildings
such
as
these
gathered
in
such
a
holder
as
this
tiny
isle
and
where
else
are
just
such
delicate
and
as
i
have
said
light
and
almost
feminine
elegance
and
charm
set
in
the
midst
of
such
severe
sterility
once
beyond
philae
the
great
cataract
roared
down
from
the
wastes
of
nubia
into
the
green
fertility
of
upper
egypt
it
roars
no
longer
but
still
the
masses
of
the
rocks
and
still
the
amber
and
the
yellow
sands
and
still
the
hills
keep
guard
round
philae
and
still
despite
the
vulgar
desecration
that
has
turned
shellal
into
a
workmen
s
suburb
and
dowered
it
with
a
there
is
a
mystery
in
philae
and
the
sense
of
isolation
that
only
an
island
gives
even
now
one
can
forget
in
philae
forget
after
a
while
and
in
certain
parts
of
its
buildings
the
presence
of
the
grey
disease
forget
the
threatening
of
the
altruists
who
desire
to
benefit
humanity
by
clearing
as
much
beauty
out
of
humanity
s
as
possible
forget
the
fact
of
the
railway
except
when
the
shriek
of
the
engine
floats
over
the
water
to
one
s
ears
forget
economic
problems
and
the
destruction
that
their
solving
brings
upon
the
silent
world
of
things
whose
use
denied
unrecognized
or
laughed
at
to
man
is
in
their
holy
beauty
whose
mission
lies
not
upon
the
broad
highways
where
tramps
the
hungry
body
but
upon
the
secret
shadowy
byways
where
glides
the
hungry
soul
yes
one
can
forget
even
now
in
the
hall
of
the
temple
of
isis
where
the
capricious
graces
of
color
where
like
old
and
delicious
music
in
the
golden
strings
of
a
harp
dwells
a
something
what
is
it
a
murmur
or
a
perfume
or
a
breathing
of
old
and
vanished
years
when
forsaken
gods
were
worshipped
and
one
can
forget
in
the
chapel
of
hathor
on
whose
wall
little
horus
is
born
and
in
the
grey
hounds
chapel
beside
it
one
can
forget
for
one
walks
in
beauty
lovely
are
the
doorways
in
philae
enticing
are
the
shallow
steps
that
lead
one
onward
and
upward
gracious
the
yellow
towers
that
seem
to
smile
a
quiet
welcome
and
there
is
one
chamber
that
is
simply
a
place
of
magic
the
hall
of
the
flowers
it
is
this
chamber
which
always
makes
me
think
of
philae
as
a
lovely
temple
of
dreams
this
silent
retired
chamber
where
some
fabled
princess
might
well
have
been
touched
to
a
long
long
sleep
of
enchantment
and
lain
for
years
upon
years
among
the
magical
flowers
the
lotus
and
the
palm
and
the
papyrus
in
my
youth
it
made
upon
me
an
indelible
impression
through
intervening
years
filled
with
many
new
impressions
many
wanderings
many
visions
of
beauty
in
other
lands
that
retired
painted
chamber
had
not
faded
from
my
mind
or
shall
i
say
from
my
heart
there
had
seemed
to
me
within
it
something
that
was
ineffable
as
in
a
lyric
of
shelley
s
there
is
something
that
is
ineffable
or
in
certain
pictures
of
boecklin
such
as
the
villa
by
the
and
when
at
last
almost
afraid
and
hesitating
i
came
into
it
once
more
i
found
in
it
again
the
strange
spell
of
old
enchantment
it
seems
as
if
this
chamber
had
been
imagined
by
a
poet
who
had
set
it
in
the
centre
of
the
temple
of
his
dreams
it
is
such
a
spontaneous
chamber
that
one
can
scarcely
imagine
it
more
than
a
day
and
a
night
in
the
building
yet
in
detail
it
is
lovely
it
is
finished
and
strangely
mighty
it
is
a
lyric
in
stone
the
most
poetical
chamber
perhaps
in
the
whole
of
egypt
for
philae
i
count
in
egypt
though
really
it
is
in
nubia
one
who
has
not
seen
philae
may
perhaps
wonder
how
a
tall
chamber
of
solid
stone
containing
heavy
and
soaring
columns
can
be
like
a
lyric
of
shelley
s
can
be
exquisitely
spontaneous
and
yet
hold
a
something
of
mystery
that
makes
one
tread
softly
in
it
and
fear
to
disturb
within
it
some
lovely
sleeper
of
nubia
some
princess
of
the
nile
he
must
continue
to
wonder
to
describe
this
chamber
calmly
as
i
might
for
instance
describe
the
temple
of
derr
would
be
simply
to
destroy
it
for
things
ineffable
can
not
be
fully
explained
or
not
be
fully
felt
by
those
the
twilight
of
whose
dreams
is
fitted
to
mingle
with
their
twilight
they
who
are
meant
to
love
with
ardor
passionnent
pour
la
and
they
who
are
meant
to
take
and
to
keep
the
spirit
of
a
dream
whether
it
be
hidden
in
a
poem
or
held
in
the
cup
of
a
flower
or
enfolded
in
arms
of
stone
will
surely
never
miss
it
even
though
they
can
hear
roaring
loudly
above
its
elfin
voice
the
cry
of
directed
waters
rushing
down
to
upper
egypt
how
can
one
disentangle
from
their
tapestry
web
the
different
threads
of
a
spell
and
even
if
one
could
if
one
could
hold
them
up
and
explain
the
cause
of
the
spell
is
that
this
comes
in
contact
with
this
and
that
this
which
i
show
you
blends
with
fades
into
this
how
could
it
advantage
any
one
nothing
could
be
made
clearer
nothing
be
really
explained
the
ineffable
is
and
must
ever
remain
something
remote
and
mysterious
and
so
one
may
say
many
things
of
this
painted
chamber
of
philae
and
yet
never
convey
perhaps
never
really
know
the
innermost
cause
of
its
charm
in
it
there
is
obvious
beauty
of
form
and
a
seizing
beauty
of
color
beauty
of
sunlight
and
shadow
of
antique
association
this
turquoise
blue
is
enchanting
and
isis
was
worshipped
here
what
has
the
one
to
do
with
the
other
nothing
and
yet
how
much
for
is
not
each
of
these
facts
a
thread
in
the
tapestry
web
of
the
spell
the
eyes
see
the
rapture
of
this
very
perfect
blue
the
imagination
hears
as
if
very
far
off
the
solemn
chanting
of
priests
and
smells
the
smoke
of
strange
perfumes
and
sees
the
long
aquiline
nose
and
the
thin
haughty
lips
of
the
goddess
and
the
color
becomes
strange
to
the
eyes
as
well
as
very
lovely
because
perhaps
it
was
there
it
almost
certainly
was
there
when
from
constantinople
went
forth
the
decree
that
all
egypt
should
be
christian
when
the
priests
of
the
sacred
brotherhood
of
isis
were
driven
from
their
temple
isis
nursing
horus
gave
way
to
the
virgin
and
the
child
but
the
cycles
spin
away
down
the
ringing
grooves
of
from
egypt
has
passed
away
that
decreed
christianity
now
from
the
minaret
the
muezzin
cries
and
in
villages
i
hear
the
loud
hymns
of
earnest
pilgrims
starting
on
the
journey
to
mecca
and
ever
this
painted
chamber
shelters
its
mystery
of
poetry
its
mystery
of
charm
and
still
its
marvellous
colors
are
fresh
as
in
the
pagan
days
and
the
opening
and
the
closed
and
the
palm
and
the
papyrus
are
on
the
perfect
columns
and
their
intrinsic
loveliness
and
their
freshness
and
their
age
and
the
mysteries
they
have
looked
on
all
these
facts
are
part
of
the
spell
that
governs
us
in
edfu
one
is
enclosed
in
a
wonderful
austerity
and
one
can
only
worship
in
philae
one
is
wrapped
in
a
radiance
of
color
and
one
can
only
dream
for
there
is
and
there
a
wonderful
green
like
the
green
light
that
lingers
in
the
west
and
there
is
a
blue
as
deep
as
the
blue
of
a
tropical
sea
and
there
are
and
lustrous
ardent
red
and
the
odd
fantasy
in
the
coloring
is
not
that
like
the
fantasy
in
the
temple
of
a
dream
for
those
who
painted
these
capitals
for
the
greater
glory
of
isis
did
not
fear
to
depart
from
nature
and
to
their
patient
worship
a
blue
palm
perhaps
seemed
a
rarely
sacred
thing
and
that
palm
is
part
of
the
spell
and
the
reliefs
upon
the
walls
and
even
the
coptic
crosses
that
are
cut
into
the
stone
but
at
the
end
one
can
only
say
that
this
place
is
indescribable
and
not
because
it
is
complex
or
terrifically
grand
like
karnak
go
to
it
on
a
sunlit
morning
or
stand
in
it
in
late
afternoon
and
perhaps
you
will
feel
that
it
suggests
you
and
that
it
carries
you
away
out
of
familiar
regions
into
a
land
of
dreams
where
among
hidden
ways
the
soul
is
lost
in
magic
yes
you
are
gone
to
the
right
for
one
alas
can
not
live
in
a
dream
for
ever
is
a
lovely
doorway
through
which
one
sees
the
river
facing
it
is
another
doorway
showing
a
fragment
of
the
poor
vivisected
island
some
ruined
walls
and
still
another
doorway
in
which
again
is
framed
the
nile
many
people
have
cut
their
names
upon
the
walls
of
philae
once
as
i
sat
alone
there
i
felt
strongly
attracted
to
look
upward
to
a
wall
as
if
some
personality
enshrined
within
the
stone
were
watching
me
or
calling
i
looked
and
saw
written
philae
is
the
last
temple
that
one
visits
before
he
gives
himself
to
the
wildness
of
the
solitudes
of
nubia
it
stands
at
the
very
frontier
as
one
goes
up
the
nile
it
is
like
a
smiling
adieu
from
the
egypt
one
is
leaving
as
one
comes
down
it
is
like
a
smiling
welcome
in
its
delicate
charm
i
feel
something
of
the
charm
of
the
egyptian
character
there
are
moments
indeed
when
i
identify
egypt
with
philae
for
in
philae
one
must
dream
and
on
the
nile
too
one
must
dream
and
always
the
dream
is
happy
and
shot
through
with
radiant
light
light
that
is
as
radiant
as
the
colors
in
philae
s
temple
the
pylons
of
ptolemy
smile
at
you
as
you
go
up
or
come
down
the
river
and
the
people
of
egypt
smile
as
they
enter
into
your
dream
a
suavity
too
is
theirs
i
think
of
them
often
as
artists
who
know
their
parts
in
the
who
know
exactly
their
function
and
how
to
fulfil
it
rightly
they
sing
while
you
are
dreaming
but
it
is
an
like
the
murmur
of
an
eastern
river
far
off
from
any
sea
it
never
disturbs
this
music
but
it
helps
you
in
your
dream
and
they
are
softly
gay
and
in
their
eyes
there
is
often
the
gleam
of
sunshine
for
they
are
the
children
but
not
grown
men
of
the
sun
that
indeed
is
one
of
the
many
strange
things
in
egypt
the
youthfulness
of
its
age
the
childlikeness
of
its
almost
terrible
antiquity
one
goes
there
to
look
at
the
oldest
things
in
the
world
and
to
feel
perpetually
young
young
as
philae
is
young
as
a
lyric
of
shelley
s
is
young
as
all
of
our
are
young
as
the
people
of
egypt
are
young
oh
that
egypt
could
be
kept
as
it
is
even
as
it
is
now
that
philae
could
be
preserved
even
as
it
is
now
the
spoilers
are
there
those
blithe
modern
spirits
so
frightfully
clever
and
capable
so
industrious
so
determined
so
unsparing
of
themselves
and
of
others
already
they
are
at
work
benefiting
tall
chimneys
begin
to
vomit
smoke
along
the
nile
a
damnable
for
little
trolleys
leads
one
toward
the
wonderful
colossi
of
memnon
close
to
kom
ombos
some
soul
imbued
with
romance
has
had
the
inspiration
to
set
up
a
factory
and
philae
is
it
to
go
is
beauty
then
of
no
value
in
the
world
is
it
always
to
be
the
prey
of
modern
progress
is
nothing
to
be
considered
sacred
nothing
to
be
left
untouched
unsmirched
by
the
grimy
fingers
of
improvement
i
suppose
nothing
then
let
those
who
still
care
to
dream
go
now
to
philae
s
painted
chamber
by
the
long
reaches
of
the
nile
go
on
if
they
will
to
the
giant
forms
of
among
the
nubian
sands
and
perhaps
they
will
think
with
me
that
in
some
dreams
there
is
a
value
greater
than
the
value
that
is
entered
in
any
and
they
will
say
with
me
however
uselessly
leave
to
the
world
some
dreams
some
places
in
which
to
dream
for
if
it
needs
dams
to
make
the
grain
grow
in
the
stretches
of
land
that
were
barren
and
railways
and
and
factory
chimneys
that
vomit
black
smoke
in
the
face
of
the
sun
surely
it
needs
also
painted
chambers
of
philae
and
the
silence
that
comes
down
from
xviii
old
cairo
by
old
cairo
i
do
not
mean
only
vieux
of
the
the
little
desolate
village
containing
the
famous
coptic
church
of
abu
sergius
in
the
crypt
of
which
the
virgin
mary
and
christ
are
said
to
have
stayed
when
they
fled
to
the
land
of
egypt
to
escape
the
fury
of
king
herod
but
the
cairo
that
is
not
new
that
is
not
dedicated
wholly
to
officialdom
and
tourists
that
in
the
midst
of
changes
and
the
advance
of
civilisation
civilisation
that
does
so
much
harm
as
well
as
so
much
good
that
showers
benefits
with
one
hand
and
defaces
beauty
with
the
other
preserves
its
immemorial
calm
or
immemorial
turmult
that
stands
aloof
as
stands
aloof
ever
the
eastern
from
the
western
man
even
in
the
midst
of
what
seems
perhaps
like
intimacy
eastern
to
the
soul
though
the
fantasies
the
passions
the
vulgarities
the
brilliant
ineptitudes
of
the
west
beat
about
it
like
waves
about
some
unyielding
wall
of
the
sea
when
i
went
back
to
egypt
after
a
lapse
of
many
years
i
fled
at
once
from
cairo
and
upon
the
long
reaches
of
the
nile
in
the
great
spaces
of
the
libyan
desert
in
the
luxuriant
of
the
fayyum
among
the
and
on
the
pale
waters
of
kurun
i
forgot
the
changes
which
in
my
brief
glimpse
of
the
city
and
its
environs
had
moved
me
to
despondency
but
one
can
not
live
in
the
solitudes
for
ever
and
at
last
from
with
the
first
pilgrims
starting
for
mecca
i
returned
to
the
great
city
determined
to
seek
in
it
once
more
for
the
fascinations
it
used
to
hold
and
perhaps
still
held
in
the
hidden
ways
where
modern
feet
nearly
always
in
a
hurry
had
seldom
time
to
penetrate
a
mist
hung
over
the
land
out
of
it
with
a
sort
of
stern
energy
there
came
to
my
ears
loud
hymns
sung
by
the
pilgrim
voices
hymns
in
which
mingled
with
the
enthusiasm
of
devotees
en
route
for
the
holiest
shrine
of
their
faith
there
seemed
to
sound
the
resolution
of
men
strung
up
to
confront
the
fatigues
and
the
dangers
of
a
great
journey
through
a
wild
and
unknown
country
those
hymns
led
my
feet
to
the
venerable
mosques
of
cairo
the
city
of
mosques
guided
me
on
my
lesser
pilgrimage
among
the
cupolas
and
the
colonnades
where
grave
men
dream
in
the
silence
near
marble
fountains
or
bend
muttering
their
prayers
beneath
domes
that
are
dimmed
by
the
ruthless
fingers
of
time
in
the
buildings
consecrated
to
prayer
and
to
meditation
i
first
sought
for
the
magic
that
still
lurks
in
the
teeming
bosom
of
cairo
long
as
i
had
sought
it
elsewhere
in
the
brilliant
bazaars
by
day
and
by
night
in
the
winding
alleys
where
the
jews
looked
stealthily
forth
from
the
doorways
where
the
circassian
girls
promenade
gleaming
with
golden
coins
and
barbaric
jewels
where
the
air
is
alive
with
music
that
is
feverish
and
antique
and
in
strangely
lighted
interiors
one
sees
forms
clad
in
brilliant
draperies
or
severely
draped
in
the
simplest
garments
moving
in
languid
dances
fluttering
painted
figures
bending
swaying
dropping
down
like
the
forms
that
people
a
dream
in
the
bazaars
is
the
passion
for
gain
in
the
alleys
of
music
and
light
is
the
passion
for
pleasure
in
the
mosques
is
the
passion
for
prayer
that
connects
the
souls
of
men
with
the
unseen
but
strongly
felt
world
each
of
these
passions
is
old
each
of
these
passions
in
the
heart
of
islam
is
fierce
on
my
return
to
cairo
i
sought
for
the
hidden
fire
that
is
magic
in
the
dusky
places
of
prayer
a
mist
lay
over
the
city
as
i
stood
in
a
narrow
byway
and
gazed
up
at
a
heavy
lattice
of
which
the
decayed
and
blackened
wood
seemed
on
guard
before
some
tragic
or
weary
secret
before
me
was
the
entrance
to
the
mosque
of
older
than
any
mosque
in
cairo
save
only
the
mosque
of
amru
it
is
approached
by
a
flight
of
steps
on
each
side
of
which
stand
old
impenetrable
houses
above
my
head
strung
across
from
one
house
to
the
other
were
many
little
red
and
yellow
flags
ornamented
with
gold
lozenges
these
were
to
bear
witness
that
in
a
couple
of
days
time
from
the
great
open
place
beneath
the
citadel
of
cairo
the
sacred
carpet
was
to
set
out
on
its
long
journey
to
mecca
my
guide
struck
on
a
door
and
uttered
a
fierce
cry
a
small
shutter
in
the
blackened
lattice
was
opened
and
a
young
girl
with
eyelids
and
a
brilliant
yellow
handkerchief
tied
over
her
coarse
black
hair
leaned
out
held
a
short
parley
and
vanished
drawing
the
shutter
to
behind
her
the
mist
crept
about
the
tawdry
flags
a
heavy
door
creaked
whined
on
its
hinges
and
from
the
house
of
the
girl
there
came
an
old
fat
man
bearing
a
mighty
key
in
a
moment
i
was
free
of
the
mosque
of
i
ascended
the
steps
passed
through
a
doorway
and
found
myself
on
a
piece
of
waste
ground
flanked
on
the
right
by
an
old
mysterious
wall
and
on
the
left
by
the
long
wall
of
the
mosque
from
which
close
to
me
rose
a
grey
unornamented
minaret
full
of
the
plain
dignity
of
unpretending
age
upon
its
summit
was
perched
a
large
and
bird
with
draggled
feathers
which
remained
so
still
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
sad
ornament
set
there
above
the
city
and
watching
it
for
ever
with
eyes
that
could
not
see
at
right
angles
touching
the
mosque
was
such
a
house
as
one
can
see
only
in
the
east
fantastically
old
fantastically
decayed
bleared
discolored
filthy
melancholy
showing
hideous
windows
like
windows
in
the
slum
of
a
town
set
above
in
a
colliery
district
a
degraded
house
and
yet
a
house
which
roused
the
imagination
and
drove
it
to
its
work
in
this
building
once
dwelt
the
high
priest
of
the
mosque
this
dwelling
the
ancient
wall
the
grey
minaret
with
its
motionless
bird
the
lamentable
waste
ground
at
my
feet
prepared
me
rightly
to
appreciate
the
bit
of
old
cairo
i
had
come
to
see
people
who
are
bored
by
gothic
churches
would
not
love
the
mosque
of
no
longer
is
it
used
for
worship
it
contains
no
praying
life
abandoned
bare
and
devoid
of
all
lovely
ornament
it
stands
like
some
hoary
patriarch
naked
and
calm
waiting
its
destined
end
without
impatience
and
without
fear
it
is
a
fatalistic
mosque
and
is
impressive
like
a
fatalistic
man
the
great
court
of
it
three
hundred
feet
square
with
pointed
arches
supported
by
piers
double
and
on
the
side
looking
toward
mecca
quintuple
arcades
has
a
great
dignity
of
sombre
simplicity
not
grace
not
a
light
elegance
of
soaring
beauty
but
massiveness
and
heavy
strength
are
distinguishing
features
of
this
mosque
even
the
octagonal
basin
and
its
protecting
cupola
that
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
court
lack
the
charm
that
belongs
to
so
many
of
the
fountains
of
cairo
there
are
two
minarets
the
minaret
of
the
bird
and
a
larger
one
approached
by
a
big
stairway
up
which
so
my
dragoman
told
me
a
sultan
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
loved
to
ride
his
favorite
horse
upon
the
summit
of
this
minaret
i
stood
for
a
long
time
looking
down
over
the
city
grey
it
was
that
morning
almost
as
london
is
grey
but
the
sounds
that
came
up
softly
to
my
ears
out
of
the
mist
were
not
the
sounds
of
london
those
many
minarets
almost
like
columns
of
fog
rising
above
the
cupolas
spoke
to
me
of
the
east
even
upon
this
sad
and
sunless
morning
once
from
where
i
was
standing
at
the
time
appointed
went
forth
the
call
to
prayer
and
in
the
barren
court
beneath
me
there
were
crowds
of
ardent
worshippers
stern
men
paced
upon
the
huge
terrace
just
at
my
feet
fingering
their
heads
and
under
that
heavy
cupola
were
made
the
long
ablutions
of
the
faithful
but
now
no
man
comes
to
this
old
place
no
murmur
to
god
disturbs
the
heavy
silence
and
the
silence
and
the
emptiness
and
the
greyness
under
the
long
arcades
all
seem
to
make
a
tremulous
proclamation
all
seem
to
whisper
i
am
very
old
i
am
useless
i
cumber
the
even
the
mosque
of
amru
which
stands
also
on
ground
that
looks
gone
to
waste
near
dingy
and
squat
houses
built
with
grey
bricks
seems
less
old
than
this
mosque
of
for
its
long
façade
is
striped
with
white
and
apricot
and
there
are
growing
in
its
court
near
the
two
columns
between
which
if
you
can
pass
you
are
assured
of
heaven
but
the
mosque
of
seen
upon
a
sad
day
makes
a
powerful
impression
and
from
the
summit
of
its
minaret
you
are
summoned
by
the
many
minarets
of
cairo
to
make
the
pilgrimage
of
the
mosques
to
pass
from
the
broken
arches
of
these
saracenic
cloisters
to
the
blue
mosque
the
red
mosque
the
mosques
of
mohammed
ali
of
sultan
hassan
of
kait
bey
of
and
so
on
to
the
coptic
church
that
is
the
silent
centre
of
old
it
is
said
that
there
are
over
four
hundred
mosques
in
cairo
as
i
looked
down
from
the
minaret
of
they
called
me
through
the
mist
that
blotted
completely
out
all
the
surrounding
country
as
if
it
would
concentrate
my
attention
upon
the
places
of
prayer
during
these
holy
days
when
the
pilgrims
were
crowding
in
to
depart
with
the
holy
carpet
and
i
went
down
by
the
staircase
of
the
house
and
in
the
mist
i
made
my
pilgrimage
as
every
one
who
visits
rome
goes
to
peter
s
so
every
one
who
visits
cairo
goes
to
the
mosque
of
mohammed
ali
in
the
citadel
a
gorgeous
building
in
a
magnificent
situation
the
interior
of
which
always
makes
me
think
of
court
functions
and
of
the
pomp
of
life
rather
than
of
prayer
and
more
attractive
to
me
is
the
blue
mosque
to
which
i
returned
again
and
again
enticed
almost
as
by
the
fascination
of
the
living
blue
of
a
summer
day
this
mosque
which
is
the
mosque
of
ibrahim
aga
but
which
is
familiarly
known
to
its
lovers
as
the
blue
mosque
lies
to
the
left
of
a
ramshackle
street
and
from
the
outside
does
not
look
specially
inviting
even
when
i
passed
through
its
door
and
stood
in
the
court
beyond
at
first
i
felt
not
its
charm
all
looked
old
and
rough
unkempt
and
in
confusion
the
red
and
white
stripes
of
the
walls
and
the
arches
of
the
arcade
the
mean
little
place
for
ablution
a
pipe
and
a
row
of
brass
taps
led
the
mind
from
a
neapolitan
ice
to
a
school
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
abruptly
retiring
and
seeking
more
splendid
precincts
and
then
i
looked
across
the
court
to
the
arcade
that
lay
beyond
and
i
saw
the
exquisite
of
the
marvellous
tiles
that
gives
this
mosque
its
name
the
huge
pillars
of
this
arcade
are
striped
and
ugly
but
between
them
shone
with
an
ineffable
lustre
a
wall
of
purple
and
blue
of
purple
and
blue
so
strong
and
yet
so
delicate
that
it
held
the
eyes
and
drew
the
body
forward
if
ever
color
calls
it
calls
in
the
blue
mosque
of
ibrahim
aga
and
when
i
had
crossed
the
court
when
i
stood
beside
the
pulpit
with
its
delicious
wooden
and
studied
the
tiles
of
which
this
wonderful
wall
is
composed
i
found
them
as
lovely
near
as
they
are
lovely
far
off
from
a
distance
they
resemble
a
nature
effect
are
almost
like
a
bit
of
southern
sea
or
of
sky
a
fragment
of
gleaming
mediterranean
seen
through
the
pillars
of
a
loggia
or
of
sicilian
blue
watching
over
etna
in
the
long
summer
days
when
one
is
close
to
them
they
are
a
miracle
of
art
the
background
of
them
is
a
milky
white
upon
which
is
an
elaborate
pattern
of
purple
and
blue
generally
conventional
and
representative
of
no
known
object
but
occasionally
showing
tall
trees
somewhat
resembling
cypresses
but
it
is
impossible
in
words
adequately
to
describe
the
effect
of
these
tiles
and
of
the
tiles
that
line
to
the
very
roof
the
on
the
right
of
the
court
they
are
like
a
cry
of
ecstasy
going
up
in
this
otherwise
not
very
beautiful
mosque
they
make
it
unforgettable
they
draw
you
back
to
it
again
and
yet
again
on
the
darkest
day
of
winter
they
set
something
of
summer
there
in
the
saddest
moment
they
proclaim
the
fact
that
there
is
joy
in
the
world
that
there
was
joy
in
the
hearts
of
creative
artists
years
upon
years
ago
if
you
are
ever
in
cairo
and
sink
into
depression
go
to
the
blue
mosque
and
see
if
it
does
not
have
upon
you
an
uplifting
moral
effect
and
then
if
you
like
go
on
from
it
to
the
gamia
el
movayad
sometimes
called
el
ahmar
the
red
where
you
will
find
greater
glories
though
no
greater
fascination
for
the
tiles
hold
their
own
among
all
the
wonders
of
cairo
outside
the
red
mosque
by
its
imposing
and
lofty
wall
there
is
always
an
assemblage
of
people
for
prayers
go
up
in
this
mosque
ablutions
are
made
there
and
the
floor
of
the
arcade
is
often
covered
with
men
studying
the
koran
calmly
meditating
or
prostrating
themselves
in
prayer
and
so
there
is
a
great
coming
and
going
up
the
outside
stairs
and
through
the
wonderful
doorway
beggars
crouch
under
the
wall
of
the
terrace
the
sellers
of
cakes
of
syrups
and
and
of
the
big
and
luscious
watermelons
that
are
so
popular
in
cairo
display
their
wares
beneath
awnings
of
sackcloth
or
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
and
their
prayers
comfortably
completed
or
perhaps
not
yet
begun
the
worshippers
stand
to
gossip
or
sit
to
smoke
their
pipes
before
going
on
their
way
into
the
city
or
the
mosque
there
are
noise
and
perpetual
movement
here
stand
for
a
while
to
gain
an
impression
from
them
before
you
mount
the
steps
and
pass
into
the
spacious
peace
beyond
orientals
must
surely
revel
in
contrasts
there
is
no
tumult
like
the
tumult
in
certain
of
their
there
is
no
peace
like
the
peace
in
certain
of
their
mosques
even
without
the
slippers
carefully
tied
over
your
boots
you
would
walk
softly
gingerly
in
the
mosque
of
el
movayad
the
mosque
of
the
columns
and
the
garden
for
once
within
the
door
you
have
taken
wings
and
flown
from
the
city
you
are
in
a
haven
where
the
most
delicious
calm
seems
floating
like
an
atmosphere
through
a
lofty
colonnade
you
come
into
the
mosque
and
find
yourself
beneath
a
magnificently
ornamental
wooden
roof
the
general
effect
of
which
is
of
deep
brown
and
gold
though
there
are
deftly
introduced
many
touches
of
very
fine
red
and
strong
luminous
blue
the
walls
are
covered
with
gold
and
superb
marbles
and
there
are
many
quotations
from
the
koran
in
arab
lettering
heavy
with
gold
the
great
doors
are
of
chiseled
bronze
and
of
wood
in
the
distance
is
a
sultan
s
tomb
surmounted
by
a
high
and
beautiful
cupola
and
pierced
with
windows
of
jeweled
glass
but
the
attraction
of
this
place
of
prayer
comes
less
from
its
magnificence
from
the
shining
of
its
gold
and
the
gleaming
of
its
marbles
than
from
its
spaciousness
its
airiness
its
still
seclusion
and
its
garden
mohammedans
love
fountains
and
shady
places
as
can
surely
love
them
only
those
who
carry
in
their
minds
a
remembrance
of
the
desert
they
love
to
have
flowers
blowing
beside
them
while
they
pray
and
with
the
immensely
high
and
crenelated
walls
of
this
mosque
long
ago
they
set
a
fountain
of
pure
white
marble
covered
it
with
a
shelter
of
limestone
and
planted
trees
and
flowers
about
it
there
beneath
palms
and
tall
even
on
this
misty
day
of
the
winter
roses
were
blooming
pinks
scented
the
air
and
great
red
flowers
that
looked
like
emblems
of
passion
stared
upward
almost
fiercely
as
if
searching
for
the
sun
as
i
stood
there
among
the
worshippers
in
the
wide
colonnade
near
the
exquisitely
carved
pulpit
in
the
shadow
of
which
an
old
man
who
looked
like
abraham
was
swaying
to
and
fro
and
whispering
his
prayers
i
thought
of
omar
khayyam
and
how
he
would
have
loved
this
garden
but
instead
of
water
from
the
white
marble
fountain
he
would
have
desired
a
cup
of
wine
to
drink
beneath
the
boughs
of
the
sheltering
trees
and
he
could
not
have
joined
without
doubt
or
fear
in
the
fervent
devotions
of
the
undoubting
men
who
came
here
to
steep
their
wills
in
the
great
will
that
flowed
about
them
like
the
ocean
about
little
islets
of
the
sea
from
the
red
mosque
i
went
to
the
great
mosque
of
to
the
wonderful
mosque
of
sultan
hassan
which
unfortunately
was
being
repaired
and
could
not
be
properly
seen
though
the
examination
of
the
old
portal
covered
with
silver
gold
and
brass
the
general
of
which
is
a
delicious
dull
green
repaid
me
for
my
visit
and
to
the
exquisitely
graceful
of
kait
bey
which
is
beyond
the
city
walls
but
though
i
visited
these
and
many
other
mosques
and
tombs
including
the
tombs
of
the
khalifas
and
the
extremely
smart
modern
tombs
of
the
family
of
the
present
khedive
of
egypt
no
building
dedicated
to
worship
or
to
the
cult
of
the
dead
left
a
more
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
than
the
coptic
church
of
abu
sergius
or
abu
sargah
which
stands
in
the
desolate
and
strangely
antique
quarter
called
old
old
indeed
it
seems
almost
terribly
old
silent
and
desolate
is
it
untouched
by
the
vivid
life
of
the
rich
and
prosperous
egypt
of
a
place
of
sad
dreams
a
place
of
ghosts
a
place
of
living
spectres
i
went
to
it
alone
any
companion
however
dreary
would
have
tarnished
the
perfection
of
the
impression
old
cairo
and
its
coptic
church
can
give
to
the
lonely
traveller
i
descended
to
a
gigantic
door
of
which
was
set
in
an
old
brick
arch
this
door
upon
the
outside
was
sheeted
with
iron
when
it
opened
i
left
behind
me
the
world
i
knew
the
world
that
belongs
to
us
of
with
its
animation
its
impetus
its
flashing
changes
its
sweeping
hurry
and
i
stepped
at
once
into
surely
some
moldering
century
long
hidden
in
the
dark
womb
of
the
forgotten
past
the
door
of
closed
and
i
found
myself
in
a
sort
of
deserted
town
of
narrow
empty
streets
beetling
archways
tall
houses
built
of
grey
bricks
which
looked
as
if
they
had
turned
gradually
grey
as
hair
does
on
an
aged
head
very
very
tall
were
these
houses
they
all
appeared
horribly
almost
indecently
old
as
i
stood
and
stared
at
them
i
remembered
a
story
of
a
russian
friend
of
mine
a
landed
proprietor
on
whose
country
estate
dwelt
a
peasant
woman
who
lived
to
be
over
a
hundred
each
year
when
he
came
from
petersburg
this
old
woman
arrived
to
salute
him
at
last
she
was
a
hundred
and
four
and
when
he
left
his
estate
for
the
winter
she
bade
him
for
ever
for
ever
but
lo
the
next
year
there
she
still
was
one
hundred
and
five
years
old
deeply
ashamed
and
full
of
apologies
for
being
still
alive
i
can
not
help
it
she
said
i
ought
no
longer
to
be
here
but
it
seems
i
do
not
know
anything
i
do
not
know
even
how
to
die
the
grey
tall
houses
of
old
cairo
do
not
know
how
to
die
so
there
they
stand
showing
their
haggard
facades
which
are
broken
by
protruding
wooden
lattices
not
unlike
the
shaggy
protuberant
eyebrows
which
sometimes
sprout
above
bleared
eyes
that
have
seen
too
much
no
one
looked
out
from
these
lattices
was
there
could
there
be
any
life
behind
them
did
they
conceal
harems
of
centenarian
women
with
wrinkled
faces
and
corrugated
necks
and
hands
here
and
there
drooped
down
a
string
terminating
in
a
lamp
covered
with
minute
dust
that
wavered
in
the
wintry
wind
which
stole
tremulously
between
the
houses
and
the
houses
seemed
to
be
leaning
forward
as
if
they
were
fain
to
touch
each
other
and
leave
no
place
for
the
wind
as
if
they
would
blot
out
the
exiguous
alleys
so
that
no
life
should
ever
venture
to
stir
through
them
again
did
the
eyes
of
the
virgin
mary
did
the
baby
eyes
of
the
christ
child
ever
gaze
upon
these
buildings
one
could
almost
believe
it
one
could
almost
believe
that
already
these
buildings
were
there
when
fleeing
from
the
wrath
of
herod
mother
and
child
sought
the
shelter
of
the
crypt
of
abu
sargah
i
went
on
walking
with
precaution
and
presently
i
saw
a
man
he
was
sitting
collapsed
beneath
an
archway
and
he
looked
older
than
the
world
he
was
clad
in
what
seemed
like
a
sort
of
cataract
of
rags
an
enormous
white
beard
flowed
down
over
his
shrunken
breast
his
face
was
a
mass
of
yellow
wrinkles
his
eyes
were
closed
his
yellow
fingers
were
twined
about
a
wooden
staff
above
his
head
was
drawn
a
patched
hood
was
he
alive
or
dead
i
could
not
tell
and
i
passed
him
on
tiptoe
and
going
always
with
precaution
between
the
tall
grey
houses
and
beneath
the
lowering
arches
i
came
at
last
to
the
coptic
church
near
it
in
the
street
were
several
copts
large
fat
apparently
sleeping
in
attitudes
that
made
them
look
like
bundles
i
woke
one
up
and
asked
to
see
the
church
he
stared
changed
slowly
from
a
bundle
to
a
standing
man
went
away
and
presently
returning
with
a
key
and
a
pale
youth
admitted
me
into
one
of
the
strangest
buildings
it
was
ever
my
lot
to
enter
the
average
coptic
church
is
far
less
fascinating
than
the
average
mosque
but
the
church
of
abu
sargah
is
like
no
other
church
that
i
visited
in
egypt
its
aspect
of
hoary
age
makes
it
strangely
almost
thrillingly
impressive
now
and
then
in
going
about
the
world
one
comes
across
a
human
being
like
the
man
beneath
the
arch
who
might
be
a
thousand
years
old
two
thousand
anything
whose
appearance
suggests
that
he
or
she
perhaps
was
of
the
company
which
was
driven
out
of
eden
but
that
the
expulsion
was
not
recorded
and
now
and
then
one
happens
upon
a
building
that
creates
the
same
impression
such
a
building
is
this
church
it
is
known
and
recorded
that
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
it
had
a
patriarch
whose
name
was
shenuti
but
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
built
long
before
that
time
and
parts
of
it
look
as
if
they
had
been
set
up
at
the
very
beginning
of
things
the
walls
are
dingy
and
whitewashed
the
wooden
roof
is
peaked
with
many
high
up
on
the
walls
are
several
small
square
lattices
of
wood
the
floor
is
of
discolored
stone
everywhere
one
sees
wood
wrought
into
lattices
crumbling
carpets
that
look
almost
as
frail
and
brittle
and
fatigued
as
wrappings
of
mummies
and
matting
that
would
surely
become
as
the
dust
if
one
set
his
feet
hard
upon
it
the
structure
of
the
building
is
basilican
and
it
contains
some
strange
carvings
of
the
last
supper
the
nativity
and
demetrius
around
the
nave
there
are
monolithic
columns
of
white
marble
and
one
column
of
the
red
and
shining
granite
that
is
found
in
such
quantities
at
assuan
there
are
three
altars
in
three
chapels
facing
toward
the
east
coptic
monks
and
nuns
are
renowned
for
their
austerity
of
life
and
their
almost
fierce
zeal
in
fasting
and
in
prayer
and
in
coptic
churches
the
services
are
sometimes
so
long
that
the
worshippers
who
are
almost
perpetually
standing
use
crutches
for
their
support
in
their
churches
there
always
seems
to
me
to
be
a
cold
and
austere
atmosphere
far
different
from
the
atmosphere
of
the
mosques
or
of
any
roman
catholic
church
it
sometimes
rather
repels
me
and
generally
make
me
feel
either
dull
or
sad
but
in
this
immensely
old
church
of
abu
sargah
the
atmosphere
of
melancholy
aids
the
imagination
in
coptic
churches
there
is
generally
a
great
deal
of
woodwork
made
into
lattices
and
into
the
screens
which
mark
the
divisions
usually
four
but
occasionally
five
which
each
church
contains
and
which
are
set
apart
for
the
altar
for
the
priests
singers
and
ministrants
for
the
male
portion
of
the
congregation
and
for
the
women
who
sit
by
themselves
these
divisions
so
different
from
the
wide
spaciousness
and
airiness
of
the
mosques
where
only
pillars
and
columns
partly
break
up
the
perspective
give
to
coptic
buildings
an
air
of
secrecy
and
of
mystery
which
however
is
often
rather
repellent
than
alluring
in
the
high
wooden
lattices
there
are
narrow
doors
and
in
the
division
which
contains
the
altar
the
door
is
concealed
by
a
curtain
embroidered
with
a
large
cross
the
mohammedans
who
created
the
mosques
showed
marvellous
taste
copts
are
often
lacking
in
taste
as
they
have
proved
here
and
there
in
abu
sargah
above
one
curious
and
unlatticed
screen
near
to
a
matted
dais
droops
a
hideous
banner
red
purple
and
yellow
with
a
white
cross
peeping
in
through
an
oblong
aperture
one
sees
a
sort
of
minute
circus
in
the
form
of
a
containing
a
table
with
an
ugly
striped
cloth
there
the
eucharist
which
must
be
preceded
by
confession
is
celebrated
the
pulpit
is
of
rosewood
inlaid
with
ivory
and
ebony
and
in
what
is
called
the
there
are
some
fine
specimens
of
carved
ebony
as
i
wandered
about
over
the
tattered
carpets
and
the
crumbling
matting
under
the
peaked
roof
as
i
looked
up
at
the
galleries
or
examined
the
sculpture
and
ivory
mosaics
that
bleared
by
the
passing
of
centuries
seemed
to
be
fading
away
under
my
very
eyes
as
upon
every
side
i
was
confronted
by
the
hoary
wooden
lattices
in
which
the
dust
found
a
home
and
rested
undisturbed
and
as
i
thought
of
the
narrow
alleys
of
grey
and
silent
dwellings
through
which
i
had
come
to
this
strange
and
melancholy
temple
of
the
father
i
seemed
to
feel
upon
my
breast
the
weight
of
the
years
that
had
passed
since
pious
hands
erected
this
home
of
prayer
in
which
now
no
one
was
praying
but
i
had
yet
to
receive
another
and
a
deeper
impression
of
solemnity
and
heavy
silence
by
a
staircase
i
descended
to
the
crypt
which
lies
beneath
the
choir
of
the
church
and
there
surrounded
by
columns
of
venerable
marble
beside
an
altar
i
stood
on
the
very
spot
where
according
to
tradition
the
virgin
mary
soothed
the
christ
child
to
sleep
in
the
dark
night
and
as
i
stood
there
i
felt
that
the
tradition
was
a
true
one
and
that
there
indeed
had
stayed
the
wondrous
child
and
the
holy
mother
long
how
long
ago
the
pale
intelligent
coptic
youth
who
had
followed
me
everywhere
and
who
now
stood
like
a
statue
gazing
upon
me
with
his
lustrous
eyes
murmured
in
english
this
is
a
very
good
place
this
most
interestin
place
in
certainly
it
is
a
place
one
can
never
forget
for
it
holds
in
its
dusty
arms
what
something
impalpable
something
ineffable
something
strange
as
death
spectral
cold
yet
exciting
something
that
seems
to
creep
into
it
out
of
the
distant
past
and
to
whisper
i
am
here
i
am
not
utterly
dead
still
i
have
a
voice
and
can
murmur
to
you
eyes
and
can
regard
you
a
soul
and
can
if
only
for
a
moment
be
your
companion
in
this
sad
yet
sacred
contrast
is
the
salt
the
pepper
too
of
life
and
one
of
the
great
joys
of
travel
is
that
at
will
one
can
command
contrast
from
silence
one
can
plunge
into
noise
from
stillness
one
can
hasten
to
movement
from
the
strangeness
and
the
wonder
of
the
antique
past
one
can
step
into
the
brilliance
the
gaiety
the
vivid
animation
of
the
present
from
babylon
one
can
go
to
bulak
and
on
to
bab
zouweleh
with
its
crying
children
its
veiled
women
its
its
fruiterers
its
turbaned
ethiopians
its
black
nubians
and
almost
fair
egyptians
one
can
visit
the
bazaars
or
on
a
market
morning
spend
an
hour
at
watching
the
disdainful
camels
pass
along
the
shadowy
streets
and
the
african
negroes
with
their
almost
skins
their
bulging
eyes
in
which
yellow
lights
are
caught
and
their
huge
hands
with
thumbs
count
their
gains
or
yell
their
disappointment
over
a
bargain
from
which
they
have
come
out
not
victors
but
vanquished
if
in
cairo
there
are
melancholy
and
silence
and
antiquity
in
cairo
may
be
found
also
places
of
intense
animation
of
almost
frantic
bustle
of
uproar
that
cries
to
heaven
to
bulak
still
come
the
boats
of
the
nile
with
striped
sails
bellying
before
a
fair
wind
to
unload
their
merchandise
from
the
delta
they
bring
thousands
of
panniers
of
fruit
and
from
upper
egypt
and
from
nubia
all
manner
of
strange
and
precious
things
which
are
absorbed
into
the
great
bazaars
of
the
city
and
are
sold
to
many
a
traveller
at
prices
which
to
put
it
mildly
bring
to
the
sellers
a
good
return
for
in
egypt
if
one
leave
his
heart
he
leaves
also
not
seldom
his
skin
the
goblin
men
of
the
great
goblin
market
of
cairo
take
all
and
remain
unsatisfied
and
calling
for
more
i
said
in
a
former
chapter
that
no
fierce
demands
for
money
fell
upon
my
ears
but
i
confess
when
i
said
it
that
i
had
forgotten
certain
bazaars
of
cairo
but
what
matters
it
he
who
has
drunk
nile
waters
must
return
the
golden
country
calls
him
the
mosques
with
their
marble
columns
their
blue
tiles
their
worshippers
the
narrow
streets
with
their
tall
houses
their
latticed
windows
their
peeping
eyes
looking
down
on
the
life
that
flows
beneath
and
can
never
be
truly
tasted
the
pyramids
with
their
bases
in
the
sand
and
their
pointed
summits
somewhere
near
the
stars
the
sphinx
with
its
face
that
is
like
the
enigma
of
human
life
the
great
river
that
flows
by
the
tombs
and
the
temples
the
great
desert
that
girdles
it
with
a
golden
girdle
egypt
calls
even
across
the
space
of
the
world
and
across
the
space
of
the
world
he
who
knows
it
is
ready
to
come
obedient
to
its
summons
because
in
thrall
to
the
eternal
fascination
of
the
land
of
sand
and
ruins
and
gold
the
land
of
the
charmed
serpent
the
land
of
the
afterglow
that
may
fade
away
from
the
sky
above
the
mountains
of
libya
but
that
fades
never
from
the
memory
of
one
who
has
seen
it
from
the
base
of
some
great
column
or
the
top
of
some
mighty
pylon
the
land
that
has
a
spell
wonderful
beautiful
egypt
