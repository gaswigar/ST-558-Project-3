the
final
struggle
the
millionaire
baby
i
two
little
shoes
the
morning
of
august
eighteenth
was
a
memorable
one
to
me
for
two
months
i
had
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
during
that
time
i
had
failed
to
score
in
at
least
three
affairs
of
unusual
importance
and
the
result
was
a
decided
loss
in
repute
as
well
as
great
financial
embarrassment
as
i
had
a
mother
and
two
sisters
to
support
and
knew
but
one
way
to
do
it
i
was
in
a
state
of
profound
discouragement
this
was
before
i
took
up
the
morning
papers
after
i
had
opened
and
read
them
not
a
man
in
new
york
could
boast
of
higher
hopes
or
greater
confidence
in
his
power
to
rise
by
one
bold
stroke
from
threatened
bankruptcy
to
immediate
independence
the
paragraph
which
had
occasioned
this
amazing
change
must
have
passed
under
the
eyes
of
many
of
you
it
created
a
excitement
at
the
time
and
raised
in
more
than
one
breast
the
hope
of
speedy
fortune
it
was
attached
to
or
rather
introduced
the
most
startling
feature
of
the
week
and
it
ran
thus
a
fortune
for
a
child
cable
from
a
reward
of
five
thousand
dollars
is
offered
by
philo
ocumpaugh
to
whoever
will
give
such
information
as
will
lead
to
the
recovery
alive
or
dead
of
his
daughter
gwendolen
missing
since
the
afternoon
of
august
the
from
her
home
in
new
york
fifty
thousand
dollars
additional
and
no
questions
asked
if
she
is
restored
unharmed
within
the
week
to
her
mother
at
homewood
all
communications
to
be
addressed
to
samuel
atwater
a
minute
description
of
the
child
followed
but
this
did
not
interest
me
and
i
did
not
linger
over
it
the
child
was
no
stranger
to
me
i
knew
her
well
and
consequently
was
quite
aware
of
her
personal
characteristics
it
was
the
great
amount
offered
for
her
discovery
and
restoration
which
moved
me
so
deeply
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
fortune
for
any
man
more
than
a
fortune
to
me
who
stood
in
such
need
of
ready
money
i
was
determined
to
win
this
extraordinary
sum
i
had
my
reason
for
hope
and
in
the
light
of
this
unexpectedly
munificent
reward
decided
to
waive
all
the
considerations
which
had
hitherto
prevented
me
from
stirring
in
the
matter
there
were
other
reasons
less
selfish
which
gave
impetus
to
my
resolve
i
had
done
business
for
the
ocumpaughs
before
and
been
well
treated
in
the
transaction
i
recognized
and
understood
both
peculiarities
and
those
of
his
admired
and
devoted
wife
as
man
and
woman
they
were
kindly
honorable
and
devoted
to
many
more
interests
than
those
connected
with
their
own
wealth
i
also
knew
their
hearts
to
be
wrapped
up
in
this
child
the
sole
offspring
of
a
long
and
happy
union
and
the
actual
as
well
as
prospective
inheritor
of
more
millions
than
i
shall
ever
see
thousands
unless
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
solve
the
mystery
now
exercising
the
sympathies
of
the
whole
new
york
public
you
have
all
heard
of
this
child
under
another
name
from
her
birth
she
has
been
known
as
the
millionaire
baby
being
the
direct
heir
to
three
fortunes
two
of
which
she
had
already
received
i
saw
her
first
when
she
was
three
years
old
a
cherubic
little
being
lovely
to
look
upon
and
possessing
unusual
qualities
for
so
young
a
child
indeed
her
picturesque
beauty
and
appealing
ways
would
have
attracted
all
eyes
and
won
all
hearts
even
if
she
had
not
represented
in
her
small
person
the
wealth
both
of
the
ocumpaugh
and
rathbone
families
there
was
an
individuality
about
her
combined
with
sensibilities
of
no
ordinary
nature
which
fully
accounted
for
the
devoted
affection
with
which
she
was
universally
regarded
and
when
she
suddenly
disappeared
it
was
easy
to
comprehend
if
one
did
not
share
the
thrill
of
horror
which
swept
from
one
end
of
our
broad
continent
to
the
other
those
who
knew
the
parents
and
those
who
did
not
suffered
an
equal
pang
at
the
awful
thought
of
this
petted
innocent
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
great
unknown
with
only
the
false
caresses
of
her
abductors
to
comfort
her
for
the
deprivation
of
all
those
delights
which
love
and
unlimited
means
could
provide
to
make
a
child
of
her
years
supremely
happy
her
father
and
this
was
what
gave
the
keen
edge
of
horror
to
the
whole
occurrence
was
in
europe
when
she
disappeared
he
had
been
cabled
at
once
and
his
answer
was
the
proffered
reward
with
which
i
have
opened
this
history
an
accompanying
despatch
to
his
distracted
wife
announced
his
relinquishment
of
the
project
which
had
taken
him
abroad
and
his
immediate
return
on
the
next
steamer
sailing
from
southampton
as
this
chanced
to
be
the
fastest
on
the
line
we
had
reason
to
expect
him
in
six
days
meanwhile
but
to
complete
my
personal
recapitulations
when
the
first
news
of
this
startling
abduction
flashed
upon
my
eyes
from
the
bulletin
boards
i
looked
on
the
matter
as
one
of
too
great
magnitude
to
be
dealt
with
by
any
but
the
metropolitan
police
but
as
time
passed
and
further
details
of
the
strange
and
seemingly
inexplicable
affair
came
to
light
i
began
to
feel
the
stirring
of
the
detective
instinct
within
me
did
i
say
that
i
was
connected
with
a
private
detective
agency
of
some
note
in
the
metropolis
and
a
desire
quite
apart
from
any
mere
humane
interest
in
the
event
itself
to
locate
the
intelligence
back
of
such
a
desperate
crime
an
intelligence
so
keen
that
up
to
the
present
moment
if
we
may
trust
the
published
accounts
of
the
affair
not
a
clue
had
been
unearthed
by
which
its
author
could
be
traced
or
the
means
employed
for
carrying
off
this
petted
object
of
a
thousand
cares
to
be
sure
there
was
a
theory
which
eliminated
all
crime
from
the
occurrence
as
well
as
the
intervention
of
any
one
in
the
child
fate
she
might
have
strayed
down
to
the
river
and
been
drowned
but
the
probabilities
were
so
opposed
to
this
supposition
that
the
police
had
refused
to
embrace
it
although
the
mother
had
accepted
it
from
the
first
and
up
to
the
present
moment
or
so
it
was
stated
had
refused
to
consider
any
other
as
she
had
some
basis
for
this
conclusion
i
am
still
quoting
the
papers
you
understand
i
was
not
disposed
to
ignore
it
in
the
study
i
proceeded
to
make
of
the
situation
the
details
as
i
ran
them
over
in
the
hurried
trip
i
now
made
up
the
river
to
were
as
follows
on
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
august
sixteenth
the
guests
assembled
in
ocumpaugh
white
and
gold
were
suddenly
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
appearance
among
them
of
a
young
girl
in
a
state
of
great
perturbation
who
running
up
to
the
startled
hostess
announced
that
gwendolen
the
petted
darling
of
the
house
was
missing
from
the
bungalow
where
she
had
been
lying
asleep
and
could
not
be
found
though
a
dozen
men
had
been
out
on
search
the
wretched
mother
who
as
it
afterward
transpired
had
not
only
given
the
orders
by
which
the
child
had
been
thus
removed
from
the
excitement
up
at
the
house
but
had
actually
been
herself
but
a
few
moments
before
to
see
that
the
little
one
was
well
cared
for
and
happy
seemed
struck
as
by
a
mortal
blow
at
these
words
and
uttering
a
scream
ran
out
on
the
lawn
a
crowd
of
guests
rushed
after
her
and
as
they
followed
her
flying
figure
across
the
lawn
to
the
small
copse
in
which
lay
hidden
this
favored
retreat
they
could
hear
borne
back
on
the
wind
the
wild
protests
of
the
young
nurse
that
she
had
left
the
child
for
a
minute
only
and
then
to
go
no
farther
than
the
bench
running
along
the
end
of
the
bungalow
facing
the
house
that
she
had
been
told
she
could
sit
there
and
listen
to
the
music
but
that
she
never
would
have
left
the
child
side
for
a
minute
if
she
had
not
supposed
she
would
hear
her
least
stir
protests
which
the
mother
scarcely
seemed
to
heed
and
which
were
presently
lost
in
the
deep
silence
which
fell
on
all
as
brought
to
a
stand
in
the
thick
shrubbery
surrounding
the
bungalow
they
saw
the
mother
stagger
up
to
the
door
look
in
and
turn
toward
them
with
death
in
her
face
the
river
she
gasped
the
river
and
heedless
of
all
attempt
to
stop
her
heedless
even
of
the
efforts
made
by
the
little
one
nurse
to
draw
her
attention
to
the
nearness
of
a
certain
opening
in
the
high
hedge
marking
off
the
ocumpaugh
grounds
on
this
side
she
ran
down
the
bank
in
the
direction
of
the
railway
but
fainted
before
she
had
more
than
cleared
the
thicket
when
they
lifted
her
up
they
all
saw
the
reason
for
this
she
had
come
upon
a
little
shoe
which
she
held
with
frantic
clutch
against
her
breast
her
child
shoe
which
as
she
afterward
acknowledged
she
had
loosened
with
her
own
hand
on
the
little
one
foot
of
course
after
this
the
whole
hillside
was
searched
down
to
the
fence
which
separated
it
from
the
railroad
track
but
no
further
trace
of
the
missing
child
was
found
nor
did
it
appear
possible
to
any
one
that
she
could
have
strayed
away
in
this
direction
for
not
only
was
the
bank
exceedingly
steep
and
the
fence
at
its
base
impassable
but
a
gang
of
men
working
as
good
fortune
would
have
it
at
such
a
point
on
the
road
below
as
to
render
it
next
to
impossible
for
her
to
have
crossed
the
track
within
a
either
way
without
being
observed
had
one
and
all
declared
that
not
one
of
them
had
seen
her
or
any
other
person
descend
the
slope
this
however
made
but
little
impression
on
the
mother
she
would
listen
to
no
hints
of
abduction
but
persisted
in
her
declaration
that
the
river
had
swallowed
her
darling
and
would
neither
rest
nor
turn
her
head
from
its
waters
till
some
half
a
dozen
men
about
the
place
had
been
set
systematically
to
work
to
drag
the
stream
meanwhile
the
police
had
been
notified
and
the
whole
town
aroused
the
search
which
had
been
carried
on
up
to
this
time
in
a
frantic
but
desultory
way
now
became
methodical
nor
was
it
confined
to
the
ocumpaugh
estate
all
the
roads
and
byways
within
half
a
mile
either
way
were
covered
by
a
most
careful
investigation
all
the
houses
were
entered
especially
those
which
the
child
was
most
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
but
no
one
had
seen
her
nor
could
any
trace
of
her
presence
be
found
at
five
all
hope
of
her
return
was
abandoned
and
much
against
ocumpaugh
wish
who
declared
that
the
news
of
the
child
death
would
affect
her
father
far
less
than
the
dreadful
possibilities
of
an
abduction
the
exact
facts
of
the
case
had
been
cabled
to
ocumpaugh
the
night
and
another
day
passed
bringing
but
little
relief
to
the
situation
not
an
eye
had
as
yet
been
closed
in
homewood
nor
had
the
search
ceased
for
an
instant
not
an
inch
of
the
great
estate
had
been
overlooked
yet
men
could
still
be
seen
beating
the
bushes
and
peering
into
all
the
secluded
spots
which
once
had
formed
the
charm
of
this
delightful
place
as
on
the
land
so
on
the
river
all
the
waters
in
the
dock
had
been
dragged
yet
the
work
went
on
some
said
under
the
very
eye
of
ocumpaugh
but
there
was
no
result
as
yet
in
the
city
the
interest
was
intense
the
telegraph
at
police
headquarters
had
been
clicking
incessantly
for
hours
under
the
direction
some
said
of
the
superintendent
himself
everything
which
could
be
done
had
been
done
but
as
yet
the
papers
were
able
to
report
nothing
beyond
some
vague
stories
of
a
child
with
its
face
very
much
bound
up
having
been
seen
at
the
heels
of
a
woman
in
the
grand
central
station
in
new
york
and
hints
of
a
covered
wagon
with
a
crying
child
inside
which
had
been
driven
through
westchester
county
at
a
great
pace
shortly
before
sunset
on
the
previous
day
closely
followed
by
a
buggy
with
the
up
though
the
sun
shone
and
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
but
nothing
definite
nothing
which
could
give
hope
to
the
distracted
mother
or
do
more
than
divide
the
attention
of
the
police
between
two
different
but
equally
tenable
theories
then
came
the
cablegram
from
ocumpaugh
which
threw
amateur
as
well
as
professional
detectives
into
the
field
among
the
latter
was
myself
which
naturally
brings
me
back
once
more
to
my
own
conclusions
of
one
thing
i
felt
sure
very
early
in
my
cogitations
before
we
had
quitted
the
park
avenue
tunnel
in
fact
i
had
decided
in
my
own
mind
that
if
i
were
to
succeed
in
locating
the
lost
heiress
it
must
be
by
subtler
methods
than
lay
open
to
the
police
i
was
master
of
such
methods
in
this
case
at
least
and
though
one
of
many
owning
to
similar
hopes
on
this
very
train
which
was
rushing
me
through
to
homewood
i
had
no
feeling
but
that
of
confidence
in
a
final
success
how
well
founded
this
confidence
was
will
presently
appear
the
number
of
men
with
a
mysterious
air
who
alighted
in
my
company
at
station
and
immediately
proceeded
to
make
their
way
up
the
steep
street
toward
homewood
warned
me
that
it
would
soon
be
extremely
difficult
for
any
one
to
obtain
access
to
the
parties
most
interested
in
the
child
loss
had
i
not
possessed
the
advantage
of
being
already
known
to
ocumpaugh
i
should
have
immediately
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
obtaining
access
to
her
presence
and
even
with
this
fact
to
back
me
i
approached
the
house
with
very
little
confidence
in
my
ability
to
win
my
way
through
the
high
iron
gates
i
had
so
frequently
passed
before
without
difficulty
and
indeed
i
found
them
well
guarded
as
i
came
nearer
i
could
see
man
after
man
being
turned
away
and
not
till
my
card
had
been
handed
in
and
a
hurried
note
to
boot
did
i
obtain
permission
to
pass
the
first
boundary
another
note
secured
me
admission
to
the
house
but
there
my
progress
stopped
ocumpaugh
had
already
been
interviewed
by
five
reporters
and
a
special
agent
from
the
new
york
police
she
could
see
no
one
else
at
present
if
however
my
business
was
of
importance
an
opportunity
would
be
given
me
to
see
miss
porter
miss
porter
was
her
companion
and
female
factotum
as
i
had
calculated
upon
having
a
words
with
the
mother
herself
i
was
greatly
thrown
out
by
this
but
going
upon
the
principle
that
half
a
loaf
was
better
than
no
bread
i
was
about
to
express
a
desire
to
see
miss
porter
when
an
incident
occurred
which
effectually
changed
my
mind
in
this
regard
the
hall
in
which
i
was
standing
and
which
communicated
with
the
side
door
by
which
i
had
entered
ended
in
a
staircase
leading
as
i
had
reason
to
believe
to
the
smaller
and
less
pretentious
rooms
in
the
rear
of
the
house
while
i
hesitated
what
reply
to
give
the
girl
awaiting
my
decision
i
caught
the
sound
of
soft
weeping
from
the
top
of
this
staircase
and
presently
beheld
the
figure
of
a
young
woman
coming
slowly
down
clad
in
coat
and
hat
and
giving
every
evidence
both
in
dress
and
manner
of
leaving
for
good
it
was
miss
graham
a
young
woman
who
held
the
position
of
to
the
child
i
had
seen
her
before
and
had
no
small
admiration
for
her
and
the
sensations
i
experienced
at
the
sight
of
her
leaving
the
house
where
her
services
were
apparently
no
longer
needed
proved
to
me
possibly
for
the
first
time
that
i
had
more
heart
in
my
breast
than
i
had
ever
before
realized
but
it
was
not
this
which
led
me
to
say
to
the
maid
standing
before
me
that
i
preferred
to
see
ocumpaugh
herself
and
would
call
early
the
next
day
it
was
the
thought
that
this
sorrowing
girl
would
have
to
pass
the
gauntlet
of
many
prying
eyes
on
her
way
to
the
station
and
that
she
might
be
glad
of
an
escort
whom
she
knew
and
had
shown
some
trust
in
also
but
the
reasons
behind
that
also
will
soon
become
sufficiently
apparent
i
was
right
in
supposing
that
my
presence
on
the
porch
outside
would
be
a
pleasing
surprise
to
her
though
her
tears
continued
to
flow
she
accepted
my
proffered
companionship
with
gratitude
and
soon
we
were
passing
side
by
side
across
the
lawn
toward
a
short
cut
leading
down
the
bank
to
the
small
used
by
the
family
and
by
certain
favored
neighbors
as
we
threaded
the
shrubbery
which
is
very
thick
about
the
place
she
explained
to
me
the
cause
of
her
abrupt
departure
the
sight
of
her
it
seems
had
become
insupportable
to
ocumpaugh
though
no
blame
could
be
rightfully
attached
to
her
it
was
certainly
true
that
the
child
had
been
carried
off
while
in
her
charge
and
however
hard
it
might
be
for
few
could
blame
the
mother
for
wishing
her
removed
from
the
house
desolated
by
her
lack
of
vigilance
but
she
was
a
good
girl
and
felt
the
humiliation
of
her
departure
almost
in
the
light
of
a
disgrace
as
we
came
again
into
an
open
portion
of
the
lawn
she
stopped
short
and
looked
back
oh
she
cried
gripping
me
by
the
arm
there
is
ocumpaugh
still
at
the
window
all
night
she
has
stood
there
except
when
she
flew
down
to
the
river
at
the
sound
of
some
imaginary
call
from
the
boats
she
believes
she
really
believes
that
they
will
yet
come
upon
body
in
the
dock
there
following
the
direction
of
her
glance
i
looked
up
was
that
ocumpaugh
that
haggard
intent
figure
with
eyes
fixed
in
awful
expectancy
on
the
sinister
group
i
could
picture
to
myself
down
at
the
water
edge
never
could
i
have
imagined
such
a
look
on
features
i
had
always
considered
as
cold
as
they
were
undeniably
beautiful
as
i
took
in
the
misery
it
expressed
that
awful
waiting
for
an
event
momently
anticipated
and
momently
postponed
i
found
myself
without
reason
and
simply
in
response
to
the
force
of
her
expression
unconsciously
sharing
her
expectation
and
with
a
momentary
forgetfulness
of
all
the
probabilities
was
about
to
turn
toward
the
spot
upon
which
her
glances
were
fixed
when
a
touch
on
my
arm
recalled
me
to
myself
come
whispered
my
trembling
companion
she
may
look
down
and
see
us
here
i
yielded
to
her
persuasion
and
turned
away
into
the
cluster
of
trees
that
lay
between
us
and
that
opening
in
the
hedge
through
which
our
course
lay
had
i
been
alone
i
should
not
have
budged
till
i
had
seen
some
change
any
change
in
the
face
whose
appearance
had
so
deeply
affected
me
ocumpaugh
certainly
believes
that
the
body
of
her
child
lies
in
the
water
i
remarked
as
we
took
our
way
onward
as
rapidly
as
possible
do
you
know
her
reasons
for
this
she
says
and
i
think
she
is
right
so
far
that
the
child
has
been
bent
for
a
long
time
on
fishing
that
she
has
heard
her
father
talk
repeatedly
of
his
great
luck
in
canada
last
year
and
wished
to
try
the
sport
for
herself
that
she
has
been
forbidden
to
go
to
the
river
but
must
have
taken
the
first
opportunity
when
no
eye
was
on
her
to
do
so
and
and
ocumpaugh
shows
a
bit
of
string
which
she
found
last
night
in
the
bushes
alongside
the
tracks
when
she
ran
down
as
i
have
said
at
some
imaginary
shout
from
the
boats
a
string
which
she
declares
she
saw
rolled
up
in
gwendolen
hand
when
she
went
into
the
bungalow
to
look
at
her
of
course
it
may
not
be
the
same
but
ocumpaugh
thinks
it
is
and
do
you
think
it
possible
after
all
that
the
child
did
stray
down
to
the
water
no
was
the
vehement
disclaimer
gwendolen
feet
were
excessively
tender
she
could
not
have
taken
three
steps
in
only
one
shoe
i
should
have
heard
her
cry
out
what
if
she
went
in
some
one
arms
a
stranger
she
had
a
decided
instinct
against
strangers
never
could
any
one
she
did
not
know
and
like
have
carried
her
so
far
as
that
without
her
waking
then
those
men
on
the
track
they
would
have
seen
her
no
trevitt
it
was
not
in
direction
she
went
the
force
of
her
emphasis
convinced
me
that
she
had
an
opinion
of
her
own
in
regard
to
this
matter
was
it
one
she
was
ready
to
impart
in
what
direction
then
i
asked
with
a
gentleness
i
hoped
would
prove
effective
her
impulse
was
toward
a
frank
reply
i
saw
her
lips
part
and
her
eyes
take
on
the
look
which
precedes
a
direct
avowal
but
as
chance
would
have
it
we
came
at
that
moment
upon
the
thicket
inclosing
the
bungalow
and
the
sight
of
its
picturesque
walls
showing
brown
through
the
verdure
of
the
surrounding
shrubbery
seemed
to
act
as
a
check
upon
her
for
with
a
quick
look
and
a
certain
dry
accent
quite
new
in
her
speech
she
suddenly
inquired
if
i
did
not
want
to
see
the
place
from
which
gwendolen
had
disappeared
naturally
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
followed
her
as
she
turned
aside
into
the
circular
path
which
embraces
this
hidden
retreat
but
i
had
rather
have
heard
her
answer
to
my
question
than
to
have
gone
anywhere
or
seen
anything
at
that
moment
yet
when
in
full
view
of
the
bungalow
open
door
she
stopped
to
point
out
to
me
the
nearness
of
the
place
to
that
opening
in
the
hedge
we
had
just
been
making
for
and
when
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
indicate
the
tangled
little
path
by
which
that
opening
could
be
reached
directly
from
the
farther
end
of
the
bungalow
i
considered
that
my
question
had
been
answered
though
in
another
way
than
i
anticipated
even
before
i
noted
the
slight
flush
which
rose
to
her
cheek
under
my
earnest
scrutiny
as
it
is
important
for
the
exact
location
of
the
bungalow
to
be
understood
i
subjoin
a
diagram
of
this
part
of
the
ground

g

at

as
i
took
this
all
in
i
ventured
to
ask
some
particulars
of
the
family
living
so
near
the
ocumpaughs
who
occupies
that
house
i
asked
pointing
to
the
sloping
roofs
and
ornamental
chimneys
arising
just
beyond
us
over
the
oh
that
is
carew
home
she
is
a
widow
and
dearest
friend
how
she
loved
gwendolen
how
we
all
loved
her
and
now
that
she
burst
into
tears
they
were
genuine
ones
so
was
her
grief
i
waited
till
she
was
calm
again
then
i
inquired
very
softly
what
wretch
you
have
not
been
inside
she
suggested
pointing
sharply
to
the
bungalow
i
took
the
implied
rebuke
and
entered
the
door
she
indicated
a
man
was
sitting
within
but
he
rose
and
went
out
when
he
saw
us
he
wore
a
policeman
badge
and
evidently
recognized
her
or
possibly
myself
i
noted
however
that
he
did
not
go
far
from
the
doorway
it
is
only
a
den
remarked
miss
graham
i
looked
about
me
she
had
described
it
perfectly
a
place
to
lounge
in
on
an
august
day
like
the
present
walls
of
georgia
pine
across
one
of
which
hung
a
series
of
long
dark
rugs
a
long
low
window
looking
toward
the
house
a
few
articles
of
bamboo
furniture
describe
the
place
among
the
latter
was
a
couch
it
was
drawn
up
underneath
the
window
on
the
other
side
of
which
ran
the
bench
where
my
companion
declared
she
had
been
sitting
while
listening
to
the
music
would
you
think
my
attention
would
have
been
caught
by
the
sound
of
any
one
moving
about
here
she
cried
pointing
to
the
couch
and
then
to
the
window
but
the
window
was
closed
and
the
door
as
you
see
is
round
the
corner
from
the
bench
a
person
with
a
very
stealthy
step
apparently
very
she
admitted
oh
how
can
i
ever
forgive
myself
how
can
i
ever
ever
forgive
myself
as
she
stood
wringing
her
hands
in
sight
of
that
empty
couch
i
cast
a
scrutinizing
glance
about
me
which
led
me
to
remark
this
interior
looks
new
much
newer
than
the
outside
it
has
quite
a
modern
air
yes
the
bungalow
is
old
very
old
but
this
room
or
den
or
whatever
you
might
call
it
was
all
remodeled
and
fitted
up
as
you
see
it
now
when
the
new
house
went
up
it
had
long
been
abandoned
as
a
place
of
retreat
and
had
fallen
into
such
decay
that
it
was
a
perfect
eyesore
to
all
who
saw
it
now
it
is
likely
to
be
abandoned
again
and
for
what
a
reason
oh
the
dreadful
place
how
i
hate
it
now
gwendolen
is
gone
one
moment
i
notice
another
thing
this
room
does
not
occupy
the
whole
of
the
bungalow
either
she
did
not
hear
me
or
thought
it
unnecessary
to
reply
and
perceiving
that
her
grief
had
now
given
way
to
an
impatience
to
be
gone
i
did
not
press
the
matter
but
led
the
way
myself
to
the
door
as
we
entered
the
little
path
which
runs
directly
to
that
outlet
in
the
hedge
marked
e
i
ventured
to
speak
again
you
have
reasons
or
so
it
appears
for
believing
that
the
child
was
carried
off
through
this
very
path
the
reply
was
impetuous
how
else
could
she
have
been
spirited
away
so
quickly
besides
here
her
eye
stole
back
at
me
over
her
shoulder
i
have
since
remembered
that
as
i
ran
out
of
the
bungalow
in
my
fright
at
finding
the
child
gone
i
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
on
carew
driveway
it
did
not
mean
much
to
me
then
for
i
expected
to
find
the
child
somewhere
about
the
grounds
but
when
i
come
to
think
it
means
everything
for
a
child
cry
mingled
with
it
or
i
imagined
that
it
did
and
that
child
but
i
forcibly
interposed
the
police
should
know
this
they
do
and
so
does
ocumpaugh
but
she
has
only
the
one
idea
and
nothing
can
move
her
i
remembered
the
wagon
with
the
crying
child
inside
which
had
been
seen
on
the
roads
the
previous
evening
and
my
heart
fell
a
little
in
spite
of
myself
could
carew
tell
us
something
about
this
i
asked
with
a
gesture
toward
the
house
we
were
now
passing
no
carew
went
to
new
york
that
morning
and
had
only
just
returned
when
we
missed
gwendolen
she
had
been
for
her
little
nephew
who
has
lately
been
made
an
orphan
and
she
was
too
busy
making
him
feel
at
home
to
notice
if
a
carriage
had
passed
through
her
grounds
her
servants
then
she
had
none
all
had
been
sent
away
the
house
was
quite
empty
i
thought
this
rather
odd
but
having
at
this
moment
reached
the
long
flight
of
steps
leading
down
the
embankment
i
made
no
reply
till
we
reached
the
foot
then
i
observed
i
thought
carew
was
very
intimate
with
mrs
ocumpaugh
she
is
they
are
more
like
sisters
than
mere
friends
yet
she
goes
to
new
york
the
very
day
her
friend
gives
a
musicale
oh
she
had
good
reasons
for
that
carew
is
planning
to
sail
this
week
for
europe
and
this
was
her
only
opportunity
for
getting
her
little
nephew
who
is
to
go
with
her
but
i
do
know
as
she
will
sail
now
she
is
wild
with
grief
over
gwendolen
loss
and
will
not
feel
like
leaving
ocumpaugh
till
she
knows
whether
we
shall
ever
see
the
dear
child
again
but
i
shall
miss
my
train
here
her
step
visibly
hastened
as
it
was
really
very
nearly
due
i
had
not
the
heart
to
detain
her
but
as
i
followed
in
her
wake
i
noticed
that
for
all
her
hurry
a
curious
hesitancy
crept
into
her
step
at
times
and
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
at
any
moment
to
see
her
stop
and
confront
me
on
one
of
the
two
remaining
long
flights
of
steps
leading
down
the
steep
hillside
but
we
both
reached
the
base
without
her
having
yielded
to
this
impulse
and
presently
we
found
ourselves
in
full
view
of
the
river
and
the
small
located
but
a
few
rods
away
toward
the
left
as
we
turned
toward
the
latter
we
both
cast
an
involuntary
look
back
at
the
ocumpaugh
dock
where
a
dozen
men
could
be
seen
at
work
dragging
the
with
grappling
irons
it
made
a
sadly
suggestive
picture
and
the
young
girl
at
my
side
shuddered
violently
as
we
noted
the
expression
of
morbid
curiosity
on
the
faces
of
such
onlookers
men
and
women
as
were
drawn
up
at
the
end
of
the
small
point
on
which
the
stood
but
i
had
another
reason
than
this
for
urging
her
on
i
had
noticed
how
at
the
sight
of
her
slight
figure
descending
the
slope
some
men
or
so
had
separated
themselves
from
this
group
with
every
appearance
of
intending
to
waylay
and
question
her
she
noticed
this
too
and
drawing
up
more
closely
to
my
side
exclaimed
with
marked
feeling
save
me
from
these
men
and
i
will
tell
you
something
that
no
one
but
here
she
stopped
here
our
very
thoughts
stopped
a
shout
had
risen
from
the
group
at
the
a
shout
which
made
us
both
turn
and
even
caused
the
men
who
had
started
to
follow
us
to
wheel
about
and
rush
back
to
the
dock
with
every
appearance
of
intense
excitement
what
is
it
what
can
it
be
faltered
my
companion
they
have
found
something
see
what
is
that
the
man
in
the
boat
is
holding
up
it
looks
like
but
she
was
already
to
the
point
outstripping
the
very
men
whose
importunities
she
had
shrunk
from
a
moment
before
i
was
not
far
behind
her
and
almost
immediately
we
found
ourselves
wedged
among
the
agitated
group
leaning
over
the
little
object
which
had
been
tossed
ashore
into
the
first
hand
outstretched
to
receive
it
it
was
a
second
little
shoe
filled
with
sand
and
dripping
with
water
but
recognizable
as
similar
to
the
one
already
found
on
the
preceding
day
high
up
on
the
bank
as
this
fact
was
borne
in
on
us
all
a
groan
of
pity
broke
from
more
than
one
pair
of
lips
and
eye
after
eye
stole
up
the
hillside
to
that
far
window
in
the
great
pile
above
us
where
the
mother
form
could
be
dimly
discerned
swaying
in
an
agitation
caught
from
our
own
excitement
but
there
was
one
amongst
us
whose
glance
never
left
that
little
shoe
the
train
she
had
been
so
anxious
to
take
whistled
and
went
thundering
by
but
she
never
moved
or
noticed
suddenly
she
reached
out
her
hand
let
me
see
it
please
she
entreated
i
was
her
nurse
let
me
take
it
in
my
hand
the
man
who
held
it
passed
it
over
she
examined
it
long
and
closely
yes
it
is
hers
said
she
but
in
another
moment
she
had
laid
it
down
with
what
i
thought
was
a
very
peculiar
look
instantly
it
was
caught
up
and
carried
with
a
rush
up
the
slope
to
where
ocumpaugh
could
be
seen
awaiting
it
with
outstretched
arms
but
i
did
not
linger
to
mark
her
reception
of
it
miss
graham
had
drawn
me
to
one
side
and
was
whispering
in
my
ear
i
must
talk
to
you
i
can
not
keep
back
another
moment
what
i
think
or
what
i
feel
some
one
is
playing
with
ocumpaugh
fears
that
shoe
is
gwendolen
but
it
is
not
the
mate
of
the
one
found
on
the
bank
above
that
was
for
the
left
foot
so
is
this
did
you
not
notice
ii
a
fearsome
man
the
effect
of
this
statement
upon
me
was
greater
than
even
she
had
contemplated
you
thought
the
child
had
been
stolen
for
the
reward
she
would
bring
she
continued
she
was
not
she
was
taken
out
of
pure
hate
and
that
is
why
i
suffer
so
what
may
they
not
do
to
her
in
what
hole
hide
her
my
darling
o
my
darling
she
was
going
off
into
hysterics
but
the
look
and
touch
i
gave
her
recalled
her
to
herself
we
need
to
be
calm
i
urged
you
because
you
have
something
of
importance
to
impart
and
i
because
of
the
action
i
must
take
as
soon
as
the
facts
you
have
concealed
become
known
to
me
what
gives
you
such
confidence
in
this
belief
which
i
am
sure
is
not
shared
by
the
police
and
who
is
the
who
as
you
say
is
playing
upon
ocumpaugh
fears
a
short
time
ago
it
was
as
you
spoke
of
him
are
not
and
one
and
the
same
person
and
can
you
not
give
him
now
a
name
we
had
been
moving
all
this
time
in
the
direction
of
the
station
and
had
now
reached
the
foot
of
the
platform
pausing
she
cast
a
last
look
up
the
bank
the
trees
were
thick
and
hid
from
our
view
the
ocumpaugh
mansion
but
in
imagination
she
beheld
the
mother
moaning
over
that
little
shoe
i
shall
never
return
there
she
muttered
why
do
i
hesitate
so
to
speak
then
in
a
burst
as
i
watched
her
in
growing
excitement
she
ocumpaugh
begged
me
not
to
tell
what
she
believed
had
nothing
to
do
with
our
gwendolen
loss
but
i
can
not
keep
silence
this
proof
of
a
conspiracy
against
herself
certainly
relieves
me
from
any
promise
i
may
have
made
her
trevitt
i
am
positive
that
i
know
who
carried
off
gwendolen
this
was
becoming
interesting
intensely
interesting
to
me
glancing
about
and
noting
that
the
group
down
at
the
had
become
absorbed
again
in
renewed
efforts
toward
further
discoveries
i
beckoned
her
to
follow
me
into
the
station
it
was
but
a
step
but
it
gave
me
time
to
think
what
was
i
encouraging
this
young
girl
to
do
to
reveal
to
who
had
no
claim
upon
her
but
that
of
friendship
a
secret
which
had
not
been
given
to
the
police
true
it
might
not
be
worth
much
but
it
was
also
true
that
it
might
be
worth
a
great
deal
did
she
know
how
much
i
wanted
money
few
wanted
it
more
but
i
felt
that
i
could
not
listen
to
her
story
till
i
had
fairly
settled
this
point
i
therefore
hastened
to
interpose
a
remark
miss
graham
you
are
good
enough
to
offer
to
reveal
some
fact
hitherto
concealed
do
you
do
this
because
you
have
no
closer
friend
than
myself
or
because
you
do
not
know
what
such
knowledge
may
be
worth
to
the
person
you
give
it
to
in
money
i
mean
in
money
i
am
not
thinking
of
money
was
her
amazed
reply
i
am
thinking
of
gwendolen
i
understand
but
you
should
think
of
the
practical
results
as
well
have
you
not
heard
of
the
enormous
reward
offered
by
mr
ocumpaugh
no
i
five
thousand
dollars
for
information
and
fifty
thousand
to
the
one
who
will
bring
her
back
within
the
week
unharmed
ocumpaugh
cabled
to
that
effect
yesterday
it
is
a
large
sum
she
faltered
and
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
then
with
a
sweet
and
candid
look
which
sank
deep
into
my
heart
she
added
gravely
i
had
rather
not
think
of
money
in
connection
with
gwendolen
if
what
i
have
to
tell
leads
to
her
recovery
you
can
be
trusted
i
know
to
do
what
is
right
toward
me
trevitt
the
man
who
stole
her
from
her
couch
and
carried
her
away
through
carew
grounds
in
a
wagon
or
otherwise
is
a
heavily
whiskered
man
of
sixty
or
more
years
of
age
his
face
is
deeply
wrinkled
but
chiefly
marked
by
a
long
scar
running
down
between
his
eyebrows
which
are
so
shaggy
that
they
would
quite
hide
his
eyes
if
they
were
not
lit
up
with
an
extraordinary
expression
of
resolution
carried
almost
to
the
point
of
frenzy
a
fearsome
man
making
your
heart
stand
still
when
he
pauses
to
speak
to
you
startled
as
i
had
seldom
been
for
reasons
which
will
hereafter
appear
i
surveyed
her
in
mingled
wonder
and
satisfaction
his
name
i
demanded
i
do
not
know
his
name
again
i
stopped
to
look
at
her
does
mrs
ocumpaugh
i
do
not
think
so
she
only
knows
what
i
told
her
and
what
did
you
tell
her
ah
who
are
these
two
or
three
persons
had
entered
the
station
probably
to
wait
for
the
next
train
no
one
who
will
molest
you
but
she
was
not
content
till
we
had
withdrawn
to
where
the
hung
up
on
the
opposite
wall
turning
about
as
if
to
consult
it
she
told
the
following
story
i
never
see
a
now
but
i
think
of
her
expression
as
she
stood
there
looking
up
as
if
her
mind
were
fixed
on
what
she
probably
did
not
see
at
all
last
wednesday
no
it
was
on
the
wednesday
preceding
i
was
taking
a
ride
with
gwendolen
on
one
of
the
side
roads
branching
off
toward
fordham
we
were
in
her
own
little
pony
cart
and
as
we
seldom
rode
together
like
this
she
had
been
chattering
about
a
hundred
things
till
her
eyes
danced
in
her
head
and
she
looked
as
lovely
as
i
had
ever
seen
her
but
suddenly
just
as
we
were
about
to
cross
a
small
wooden
bridge
i
saw
her
turn
pale
and
her
whole
sensitive
form
quiver
one
i
do
like
she
cried
is
some
one
about
whom
i
do
like
drive
on
ellie
drive
on
but
before
i
could
gather
up
the
reins
a
figure
which
i
had
not
noticed
before
stepped
from
behind
a
tree
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
and
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
road
with
arms
thrown
out
stopped
our
advance
i
have
told
you
how
he
looked
but
i
can
give
you
no
idea
of
the
passionate
fury
lighting
up
his
eyes
or
the
fiery
dignity
with
which
he
held
his
place
and
kept
us
subdued
to
his
will
till
he
had
looked
the
shrinking
child
all
over
and
laughed
not
as
a
madman
laughs
oh
much
too
slow
and
ironically
for
that
but
like
one
who
takes
an
unholy
pleasure
in
mocking
the
happy
present
with
evil
prophecy
nothing
that
i
can
say
will
make
you
see
him
as
i
saw
him
in
that
one
instant
and
though
there
was
much
in
the
circumstance
to
cause
fear
i
think
it
was
more
awe
than
fright
we
felt
so
commanding
was
his
whole
appearance
and
so
forcible
the
assurance
with
which
he
held
us
there
till
he
was
ready
to
move
gwendolen
cried
out
but
the
imploring
sound
had
no
effect
upon
him
it
only
reawakened
his
mirth
and
led
him
to
say
in
a
clear
cold
mocking
tone
which
i
hear
yet
out
little
one
for
your
short
day
is
nearly
over
silks
and
feathers
and
carriages
and
servants
will
soon
be
a
memory
to
you
and
right
it
is
that
it
should
be
so
ten
days
little
one
only
ten
days
more
and
with
that
he
moved
and
slipping
aside
behind
the
tree
allowed
us
to
drive
on
trevitt
yesterday
saw
the
end
of
those
ten
days
and
where
is
she
now
only
that
man
knows
he
is
one
man
in
a
thousand
can
not
you
find
him
she
turned
a
train
was
coming
a
train
which
it
was
very
evident
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
take
i
had
no
right
to
detain
her
but
i
found
time
for
a
question
or
two
and
you
told
ocumpaugh
this
the
moment
we
arrived
home
and
she
what
did
she
think
of
it
ocumpaugh
is
not
a
talkative
woman
she
grew
very
white
and
clasped
the
child
passionately
in
her
arms
but
the
next
minute
she
had
to
all
appearance
dismissed
the
whole
occurrence
from
her
thoughts
socialistic
fanatic
she
called
him
and
merely
advised
me
to
stop
driving
with
gwendolen
for
the
present
did
you
recall
the
matter
to
her
when
you
found
the
child
missing
yes
but
then
she
appeared
to
regard
it
in
a
superstitious
way
only
it
was
a
warning
of
death
she
said
and
the
man
an
irresponsible
clairvoyant
when
i
tried
to
urge
my
own
idea
upon
her
and
describe
how
i
thought
he
might
have
obtained
access
to
the
bungalow
and
carried
her
off
while
still
asleep
to
some
vehicle
awaiting
them
in
grounds
she
only
rebuked
me
for
my
folly
and
bade
me
keep
still
about
the
whole
occurrence
saying
that
i
should
only
be
getting
some
poor
old
wretch
into
trouble
for
something
for
which
he
was
not
in
the
least
responsible
a
very
considerate
woman
i
remarked
to
which
miss
graham
made
reply
as
the
train
came
storming
up
nobody
knows
how
considerate
even
if
she
has
dismissed
me
rather
suddenly
from
her
service
do
let
that
wretch
again
she
used
the
word
deceive
her
or
you
into
thinking
that
the
little
one
perished
in
the
water
gwendolen
is
alive
i
say
find
him
and
you
will
find
her
i
saw
his
resolution
in
his
eye
here
she
made
a
rush
for
the
cars
and
i
had
time
only
to
get
her
future
address
before
the
train
started
and
all
further
opportunity
of
conversation
between
us
was
over
for
that
day
i
remained
behind
because
i
was
by
no
means
through
with
my
investigations
what
she
had
told
me
only
convinced
me
of
the
necessity
i
had
already
recognized
of
making
myself
master
of
all
that
could
be
learned
at
homewood
before
undertaking
the
very
serious
business
of
locating
the
child
or
even
the
aged
man
just
described
to
me
and
who
i
was
now
sure
had
been
the
chief
if
not
the
sole
instrument
in
her
abduction
iii
a
charming
woman
stopping
only
long
enough
to
send
a
telegram
to
my
partner
in
new
york
for
which
purpose
i
had
to
walk
along
the
tracks
to
the
main
station
i
returned
by
the
short
cut
to
homewood
my
purpose
in
doing
this
was
twofold
i
should
have
a
chance
of
seeing
if
the
men
were
still
at
work
in
the
river
and
i
should
also
have
the
added
opportunity
of
quietly
revisiting
the
bungalow
on
the
floor
of
which
i
had
noted
some
which
i
felt
called
for
a
closer
examination
than
i
had
given
them
as
i
came
in
view
of
the
dock
i
saw
that
the
men
were
still
busy
but
at
a
point
farther
out
in
the
river
as
if
all
hope
had
been
abandoned
of
their
discovering
anything
more
inshore
but
the
in
the
bungalow
were
almost
forgotten
by
me
in
the
interest
i
experienced
in
a
certain
adventure
which
befell
me
on
my
way
there
i
had
just
reached
the
opening
in
the
hedge
communicating
with
carew
grounds
when
i
heard
steps
on
the
walk
inside
and
a
rich
voice
saying
there
that
will
do
you
must
play
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
harry
and
dinah
see
that
he
does
so
and
that
he
does
not
cross
the
hall
again
till
i
come
back
the
sight
of
so
merry
a
child
might
kill
ocumpaugh
if
she
happened
to
look
this
way
moved
by
the
tone
which
was
one
in
a
thousand
i
involuntarily
peered
through
the
outlet
i
was
passing
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
its
owner
and
thus
was
favored
with
the
sight
of
a
face
which
instantly
fixed
itself
in
my
memory
as
one
of
the
most
enchanting
i
had
ever
encountered
not
from
its
beauty
yet
it
may
have
been
beautiful
nor
from
its
youth
for
the
woman
before
me
was
not
youthful
but
from
the
extraordinary
eloquence
of
its
expression
caught
at
a
rare
moment
when
the
heart
which
gave
it
life
was
full
she
was
standing
down
the
path
throwing
kisses
to
a
little
boy
who
was
leaning
toward
her
from
an
upper
window
the
child
was
laughing
with
glee
and
it
was
this
laugh
she
was
trying
to
check
but
her
countenance
as
she
made
the
effort
was
almost
as
merry
as
his
and
yet
was
filled
with
such
solemn
joy
such
ecstasy
of
motherhood
i
should
be
inclined
to
call
it
if
i
had
not
been
conscious
that
this
must
be
carew
and
the
child
her
little
nephew
that
in
my
admiration
for
this
exhibition
of
pure
feeling
i
forgot
to
move
on
as
she
advanced
into
the
and
so
we
came
face
to
face
the
result
was
as
extraordinary
to
me
as
all
the
rest
instantly
all
the
gay
abandonment
left
her
features
and
she
showed
me
a
grave
almost
troubled
countenance
more
in
keeping
with
her
severe
dress
which
was
as
nearly
like
mourning
as
it
could
be
and
not
be
made
of
crape
it
was
such
a
sudden
change
and
of
so
complete
a
character
that
i
was
thrown
off
my
guard
for
a
moment
and
probably
betrayed
the
curiosity
i
undoubtedly
felt
for
she
paused
as
she
reached
me
and
surveying
me
very
quietly
but
very
scrutinizingly
too
raised
again
that
marvelous
voice
of
hers
and
pointedly
observed
this
is
a
private
path
sir
only
the
friends
of
ocumpaugh
or
of
myself
pass
here
this
was
a
speech
calculated
to
restore
my
with
a
bow
which
evidently
surprised
her
i
answered
with
just
enough
respect
to
temper
my
apparent
presumption
i
am
here
in
the
interests
of
ocumpaugh
to
assist
her
in
finding
her
child
moments
are
precious
so
i
ventured
to
approach
by
the
shorter
way
pardon
me
the
words
did
not
come
instantly
but
after
some
hesitation
during
which
she
kept
her
eyes
on
my
face
in
a
way
to
rob
me
of
all
thought
save
that
she
possessed
a
very
strong
magnetic
quality
to
which
it
were
well
for
a
man
like
myself
to
yield
you
will
be
my
friend
too
if
you
succeed
in
restoring
gwendolen
then
quickly
as
she
crossed
to
the
ocumpaugh
grounds
you
do
not
look
like
a
member
of
the
police
are
you
here
at
ocumpaugh
bidding
and
has
she
at
last
given
up
all
expectation
of
finding
her
child
in
the
river
i
too
thought
a
minute
before
answering
then
i
put
on
my
most
candid
expression
for
was
not
this
woman
on
her
way
to
ocumpaugh
and
would
she
not
be
likely
to
repeat
what
she
heard
me
say
i
do
not
know
how
ocumpaugh
feels
at
present
but
i
know
what
her
dearest
wish
is
to
see
her
child
again
alive
and
well
that
wish
i
shall
do
my
best
to
gratify
it
is
true
that
i
am
not
a
police
detective
but
i
have
an
agency
of
my
own
to
both
and
ocumpaugh
all
its
resources
will
be
devoted
to
this
business
and
i
hope
to
succeed
madam
if
as
i
suspect
you
are
on
your
way
to
ocumpaugh
please
tell
her
that
robert
trevitt
of
trevitt
and
jupp
hopes
to
succeed
i
she
emphasized
then
stepping
back
to
me
in
all
the
grace
of
her
thrilling
personality
she
eagerly
added
if
there
is
any
information
i
can
give
do
not
be
afraid
to
ask
me
i
love
children
and
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
see
ocumpaugh
as
happy
with
gwendolen
again
as
i
am
with
my
little
nephew
are
you
quite
sure
that
there
is
any
possibility
of
this
i
was
told
that
the
child
shoe
has
been
found
in
the
river
but
almost
immediately
following
this
information
came
the
report
that
there
was
something
odd
about
this
shoe
and
that
ocumpaugh
had
gone
into
hysterics
do
know
what
they
meant
by
that
i
was
just
going
over
to
see
i
did
know
what
they
meant
but
i
preferred
to
seem
ignorant
i
have
not
seen
ocumpaugh
i
evasively
rejoined
but
look
for
the
child
to
be
drawn
from
the
water
nor
i
she
repeated
with
a
hoarse
catch
in
her
breath
it
is
hours
since
we
lost
her
time
enough
for
the
current
to
have
carried
her
sweet
little
body
far
away
from
here
i
surveyed
the
lady
before
me
in
amazement
then
think
she
strayed
down
to
the
water
yes
it
would
madden
me
to
believe
otherwise
loving
her
so
well
and
her
parents
so
well
i
dare
not
think
of
a
worse
fate
taking
advantage
of
her
amiability
and
the
unexpected
opportunity
it
offered
for
a
leading
question
i
hereupon
ventured
to
say
you
were
not
at
home
i
hear
when
she
vanished
from
the
bungalow
no
that
is
if
it
happened
before
three
i
arrived
from
the
station
just
as
the
clock
was
striking
the
hour
and
having
my
little
nephew
with
me
i
was
too
much
occupied
in
reconciling
him
to
his
new
home
to
hear
or
see
anything
outside
most
unfortunate
she
mourned
most
unfortunate
i
shall
never
cease
reproaching
myself
a
tragedy
at
my
door
here
she
glanced
across
the
shrubbery
at
the
bungalow
and
i
occupied
with
my
own
affairs
with
a
flush
the
undoubted
result
of
her
own
earnestness
she
turned
as
if
to
go
but
i
could
not
let
her
depart
without
another
question
excuse
me
carew
but
you
gave
me
permission
to
seem
importunate
with
the
exception
of
her
nurse
you
were
the
one
person
nearest
the
bungalow
at
the
time
did
you
hear
a
carriage
drive
through
your
grounds
at
about
the
hour
the
alarm
was
first
started
i
know
you
have
been
asked
this
before
but
not
by
me
and
it
is
a
very
important
fact
to
have
settled
very
important
for
those
who
wish
to
discover
this
child
at
once
for
reply
she
gave
me
a
look
of
very
honest
amazement
of
course
i
did
she
replied
i
came
in
a
carriage
myself
from
the
station
and
naturally
heard
it
drive
away
at
her
look
at
her
word
the
thread
which
i
had
seized
with
such
avidity
seemed
to
slip
from
my
fingers
had
little
miss
graham
theory
no
better
foundation
than
this
and
were
the
wheels
she
heard
only
those
of
carew
departing
carriage
i
resolved
to
press
the
matter
even
if
i
ran
the
risk
of
displeasing
her
carew
for
it
must
be
carew
i
am
addressing
did
your
little
nephew
cry
when
you
first
brought
him
to
the
house
i
think
he
did
she
admitted
slowly
i
think
he
did
i
must
have
given
evidence
of
the
sudden
discouragement
this
brought
me
for
her
lips
parted
and
her
whole
frame
trembled
with
sudden
earnestness
did
you
think
did
any
one
think
that
those
cries
came
from
gwendolen
that
she
was
carried
out
through
my
grounds
could
any
one
have
thought
that
i
have
been
told
that
the
did
little
miss
graham
poor
girl
she
is
but
defending
herself
from
despair
she
is
ready
to
believe
everything
but
that
the
child
is
dead
was
it
so
was
i
following
the
false
light
of
a
no
no
the
strange
coincidence
of
the
threat
made
on
the
bridge
with
the
disappearance
of
the
child
on
the
day
named
was
at
least
real
the
thread
had
not
altogether
escaped
from
my
hands
it
was
less
tangible
but
it
was
still
there
you
may
be
right
i
acquiesced
for
i
saw
that
her
theories
were
entirely
opposed
to
those
of
miss
graham
but
we
must
try
everything
i
was
about
to
ask
whether
she
had
ever
seen
in
the
adjoining
grounds
or
on
the
roads
about
an
old
man
with
long
hair
and
a
remarkable
scar
running
down
between
his
eyebrows
when
a
young
girl
in
the
cap
and
apron
of
a
came
running
through
the
shrubbery
from
the
ocumpaugh
house
and
seeing
carew
panted
out
oh
do
come
over
to
the
house
carew
ocumpaugh
has
been
told
that
the
two
shoes
which
have
been
found
one
on
the
bank
and
the
other
in
the
river
are
not
mates
and
it
has
quite
distracted
her
she
has
gone
to
her
room
and
will
let
no
one
else
in
we
can
hear
her
moaning
and
crying
but
we
can
do
nothing
perhaps
she
will
see
you
she
called
for
you
i
know
before
she
shut
her
door
i
will
go
carew
had
turned
quite
pale
and
from
standing
upright
in
the
road
had
moved
so
as
to
gain
support
from
one
of
the
hedges
i
expected
to
see
her
turn
and
go
as
soon
as
her
trembling
fit
was
over
but
she
did
not
though
she
waved
the
girl
away
as
if
she
intended
to
follow
her
had
i
not
learned
to
distrust
my
own
impression
of
motives
from
their
manners
and
conduct
i
should
have
said
that
she
was
waiting
for
me
to
precede
her
two
shoes
and
not
mates
she
finally
exclaimed
what
does
she
mean
simply
that
another
shoe
has
been
drawn
up
from
the
which
does
not
mate
the
one
picked
up
near
the
bungalow
both
are
for
the
left
foot
ah
gasped
this
sympathetic
woman
and
what
inference
can
we
draw
from
that
i
should
not
have
answered
her
but
the
command
in
her
eyes
or
the
thrilling
effect
of
her
manner
compelled
me
and
i
spoke
the
truth
at
once
just
as
i
might
have
done
to
ocumpaugh
or
better
still
to
ocumpaugh
if
either
had
insisted
but
one
said
i
there
is
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
one
or
more
persons
to
delude
ocumpaugh
into
believing
the
child
dead
they
blundered
over
it
but
they
came
very
near
succeeding
who
blundered
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
conspiracy
you
hint
at
tell
me
tell
me
what
such
men
as
you
think
her
plastic
features
had
again
shown
a
change
she
was
all
anxiety
now
cheeks
burning
eyes
blazing
a
very
beautiful
woman
we
think
that
the
case
looks
serious
we
think
from
the
very
mystery
it
displays
that
there
is
a
keen
intelligence
back
of
this
crime
i
can
not
go
any
further
than
that
the
affair
is
as
yet
too
obscure
you
amaze
me
she
faltered
making
an
effort
to
collect
her
thoughts
i
have
always
thought
just
as
ocumpaugh
has
that
the
child
had
somehow
found
her
way
to
the
water
and
was
drowned
but
if
all
this
is
true
we
shall
have
to
face
a
worse
evil
a
conspiracy
against
such
a
tender
little
being
as
that
a
conspiracy
and
for
what
not
to
extort
money
or
why
these
blundering
efforts
to
make
the
child
appear
dead
she
was
the
same
sympathetic
woman
agitated
by
real
feeling
as
before
yet
at
this
moment
i
do
not
understand
now
just
why
i
became
aware
of
an
inner
movement
of
caution
against
too
great
a
display
of
candor
on
my
own
part
madam
it
is
all
a
mystery
at
present
i
am
sure
that
the
police
will
tell
you
the
same
but
another
day
may
bring
developments
let
us
hope
so
was
her
ardent
reply
accompanied
by
a
gesture
the
freedom
of
which
suited
her
style
and
person
as
it
would
not
have
done
those
of
a
less
impressionable
woman
and
seeing
that
i
had
no
intention
of
leaving
the
spot
where
i
stood
she
moved
at
last
from
where
she
held
herself
upright
against
the
hedge
and
entered
the
ocumpaugh
grounds
will
you
call
in
to
see
me
she
asked
pausing
to
look
back
at
a
turn
in
the
path
i
shall
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
those
possible
developments
since
you
permit
me
i
returned
that
is
if
i
am
still
here
affairs
may
call
me
away
at
any
moment
yes
and
so
with
me
affairs
may
call
me
away
also
i
was
to
sail
on
saturday
for
liverpool
only
ocumpaugh
distress
detains
me
if
the
situation
lightens
if
we
hear
any
good
news
or
even
early
i
shall
continue
my
preparations
which
will
take
me
again
to
new
york
i
will
call
if
you
are
at
home
she
gave
me
a
slight
nod
and
vanished
why
did
i
stand
a
good
three
minutes
where
she
had
left
me
thinking
but
not
getting
anything
from
my
thoughts
save
that
i
was
glad
that
i
had
not
been
betrayed
into
speaking
of
the
old
man
miss
graham
had
met
on
the
bridge
yet
it
might
have
been
well
after
all
if
i
had
done
so
if
only
to
discover
whether
ocumpaugh
had
confided
this
occurrence
to
her
most
intimate
friend
iv
my
next
move
was
toward
the
bungalow
those
still
struck
me
as
being
worthy
of
investigation
and
not
only
they
but
the
bungalow
itself
that
certainly
merited
a
much
closer
inspection
than
i
had
been
able
to
give
it
under
miss
graham
eye
it
was
not
quite
a
new
place
to
me
nor
was
i
so
ignorant
of
its
history
and
it
had
a
history
as
i
had
appeared
to
be
in
my
conversation
with
miss
graham
originally
it
had
been
a
stabling
place
for
horses
and
tradition
said
that
it
had
once
harbored
for
a
week
the
horse
of
general
washington
this
was
when
the
house
on
the
knoll
above
had
been
the
seat
and
home
of
one
of
our
most
famous
revolutionary
generals
later
as
the
trees
grew
up
around
this
building
it
attracted
the
attention
of
a
new
owner
william
ocumpaugh
the
first
of
that
name
to
inhabit
homewood
and
he
being
a
man
of
reserved
manners
and
very
studious
habits
turned
it
into
what
we
would
now
call
as
miss
graham
did
a
den
but
which
he
styled
a
pavilion
and
used
as
a
sort
of
study
or
his
son
who
inherited
it
judge
philo
ocumpaugh
grandfather
of
the
present
philo
was
as
studious
as
his
father
but
preferred
to
read
and
write
in
the
quaint
old
library
up
at
the
house
famous
for
its
wide
glass
doors
opening
on
to
the
lawn
and
its
magnificent
view
of
the
hudson
his
desk
which
many
remember
it
has
a
place
in
the
present
house
i
believe
was
so
located
that
for
forty
years
or
more
he
had
this
prospect
ever
before
him
a
prospect
which
included
the
sight
of
his
own
pavilion
around
which
for
no
cause
apparent
to
his
contemporaries
he
had
caused
a
high
wall
to
be
built
effectually
shutting
in
both
trees
and
building
this
wall
has
since
been
removed
but
i
have
often
heard
it
spoken
of
and
always
with
a
certain
air
of
mystery
possibly
because
as
i
have
said
there
seemed
no
good
reason
for
its
erection
the
place
holding
no
treasure
and
the
gate
standing
always
open
possibly
because
of
its
having
been
painted
in
defiance
of
all
harmony
with
everything
about
the
place
a
dazzling
white
and
possibly
because
it
had
not
been
raised
till
after
the
death
of
the
judge
first
wife
who
some
have
said
breathed
her
last
within
the
precincts
it
inclosed
however
that
may
be
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
this
place
exerted
very
likely
against
his
will
for
he
never
visited
it
a
singular
fascination
over
the
secretive
mind
of
this
same
upright
but
strangely
taciturn
ancestor
of
the
ocumpaughs
for
during
the
forty
years
in
which
he
wrote
and
read
at
this
desk
the
shutters
guarding
the
door
overlooking
those
decaying
walls
were
never
drawn
to
or
so
the
tradition
runs
and
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
by
a
clause
in
his
will
this
pavilion
hut
or
bungalow
all
of
which
names
it
bore
at
different
stages
of
its
existence
was
recommended
to
the
notice
of
his
heirs
as
an
object
which
they
were
at
liberty
to
leave
in
its
present
forsaken
condition
though
he
did
not
exact
this
but
which
was
never
under
any
circumstances
or
to
serve
any
purpose
to
be
removed
from
its
present
site
or
even
to
suffer
any
demolition
save
such
as
came
with
time
and
the
natural
round
of
the
seasons
to
whose
tender
mercies
he
advised
it
to
be
left
in
other
words
it
was
to
stand
and
to
stand
unmolested
till
it
fell
of
its
own
accord
or
was
struck
to
the
earth
by
lightning
a
tragic
alternative
in
the
judgment
of
those
who
knew
it
for
a
structure
of
comparative
insignificance
and
one
which
in
the
minds
of
many
and
perhaps
i
may
say
in
my
own
appeared
to
point
to
some
serious
and
unrevealed
cause
not
unlinked
with
the
almost
forgotten
death
of
that
young
wife
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
this
was
years
ago
far
back
in
the
fifties
and
his
son
who
was
a
minor
at
his
death
grew
up
and
assumed
his
natural
proprietorship
the
hut
it
was
nothing
but
a
hut
now
had
remained
untouched
a
ruin
no
longer
habitable
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
letter
of
that
particular
clause
in
his
father
will
had
so
far
been
literally
obeyed
the
walls
being
of
stone
had
withstood
decay
and
still
rose
straight
and
firm
but
the
roof
had
begun
to
sag
and
whatever
of
woodwork
yet
remained
about
it
had
rotted
and
fallen
away
till
the
building
was
little
more
than
a
skeleton
with
holes
for
its
windows
and
an
open
gap
for
its
door
as
for
the
surrounding
wall
it
no
longer
stood
out
an
incongruous
landmark
from
its
background
of
trees
and
shrubbery
young
shoots
had
started
up
and
old
branches
developed
till
brick
and
paint
alike
were
almost
concealed
from
view
by
a
fresh
girdle
of
greenery
and
now
comes
the
second
mystery
sometime
after
this
latter
ocumpaugh
had
attained
his
majority
his
name
was
edwin
and
he
was
as
you
already
imagine
the
father
of
the
present
philo
he
made
an
attempt
a
daring
one
it
was
afterward
called
to
brighten
this
neglected
spot
and
restore
it
to
some
sort
of
use
by
giving
a
supper
to
his
friends
within
its
walls
this
supper
was
no
orgy
nor
were
the
proprieties
in
any
way
transgressed
by
so
harmless
a
festivity
yet
from
this
night
a
singular
change
was
observed
in
this
man
pleasure
no
longer
charmed
him
and
instead
of
repeating
the
experiment
i
have
just
described
he
speedily
evinced
such
an
antipathy
to
the
scene
of
his
late
revel
that
only
from
the
greatest
necessity
would
he
ever
again
visit
that
part
of
the
grounds
what
did
it
mean
what
had
occurred
on
that
night
of
innocent
enjoyment
to
disturb
or
alarm
him
had
some
note
in
his
own
conscience
been
struck
by
an
act
which
in
his
cooler
moments
he
may
have
looked
upon
as
a
species
of
sacrilege
or
had
some
whisper
from
the
past
reached
him
amid
the
feasting
the
laughing
and
the
jesting
to
render
these
old
walls
henceforth
intolerable
to
him
he
never
said
but
whatever
the
cause
of
this
sudden
aversion
the
effect
was
deep
and
promised
to
be
lasting
for
one
morning
not
long
after
this
event
a
party
of
workmen
was
seen
leaving
these
grounds
at
daybreak
and
soon
it
was
noised
about
that
a
massive
brick
partition
had
been
put
up
across
the
interior
of
this
same
pavilion
completely
shutting
off
for
no
reason
that
any
one
could
see
some
ten
feet
of
what
had
been
one
long
and
undivided
room
it
was
a
strange
act
enough
but
when
a
few
days
later
it
was
followed
by
one
equally
mysterious
and
they
saw
the
encircling
wall
which
had
been
so
carefully
raised
by
judge
ocumpaugh
ruthlessly
pulled
down
and
every
sign
of
its
former
presence
there
destroyed
wonder
filled
the
highway
and
the
curiosity
of
neighbors
and
friends
passed
all
bounds
but
no
explanations
were
volunteered
then
or
ever
people
might
query
and
peer
but
they
learned
nothing
what
was
left
open
to
view
told
no
tales
beyond
the
old
one
and
as
for
the
single
window
which
was
the
sole
opening
into
the
space
it
was
then
as
now
so
completely
blocked
up
by
a
network
of
closely
impacted
vines
that
it
offered
little
more
encouragement
than
the
wall
itself
to
the
eyes
of
such
as
crept
in
by
way
of
the
to
steal
a
look
at
the
hut
and
if
possible
gain
a
glimpse
of
an
interior
which
had
suddenly
acquired
by
the
very
means
taken
to
shut
it
off
from
every
human
eye
a
new
importance
pointing
very
decidedly
toward
the
tragic
but
soon
even
this
semblance
of
interest
died
out
or
was
confined
to
strange
tales
whispered
under
breath
on
weird
nights
at
neighboring
firesides
and
the
old
neglect
prevailed
once
more
the
whole
place
new
brick
and
old
stone
seemed
doomed
to
a
common
fate
under
the
hand
of
time
when
the
present
philo
ocumpaugh
succeeding
to
the
property
brought
new
wealth
and
business
enterprise
into
the
family
and
the
old
house
on
the
hill
was
replaced
by
the
marble
turrets
of
homewood
and
this
hut
or
rather
the
portion
open
to
improvement
was
restored
to
some
sort
of
comfort
and
rechristened
the
bungalow
was
fate
to
be
appeased
by
this
effort
at
forgetfulness
no
in
emulation
of
the
long
abandoned
portion
so
hopelessly
cut
off
by
that
dividing
wall
this
adjunct
to
the
great
house
had
linked
itself
in
the
minds
of
men
to
a
new
mystery
the
mystery
which
i
had
come
there
to
solve
if
wit
and
patience
could
do
it
aided
by
my
supposedly
unshared
knowledge
of
a
fact
connecting
me
with
this
history
in
a
way
it
little
dreamed
of
naturally
my
first
look
was
at
the
building
itself
i
have
described
its
location
and
the
room
from
which
the
child
was
lost
what
i
wanted
to
see
now
after
studying
those
was
whether
that
partition
which
had
been
put
in
was
as
impassable
as
was
supposed
the
policeman
on
guard
having
strolled
a
few
feet
away
i
approached
the
open
doorway
without
hindrance
and
at
once
took
that
close
look
i
had
promised
myself
of
the
marks
which
i
had
observed
scrawled
broadly
across
the
floor
just
inside
the
threshold
they
were
as
interesting
and
fully
as
important
as
i
had
anticipated
though
nearly
obliterated
by
the
passing
of
the
policeman
feet
across
them
i
was
still
enabled
to
read
the
one
word
which
appeared
to
me
significant
if
you
will
glance
at
the
following
reproduction
of
a
which
i
took
of
this
scrawl
you
will
see
what
i
mean
illustration
the
significant
character
was
the
taken
with
the
ust
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
whole
writing
had
been
a
record
of
the
date
on
which
the
child
had
disappeared
august
this
in
itself
was
of
small
consequence
if
the
handwriting
had
not
possessed
those
marked
peculiarities
which
i
believed
belonged
to
but
one
man
a
man
i
had
once
known
a
man
of
reverend
aspect
upright
carriage
and
a
strong
distinguishing
mark
like
an
scar
running
straight
down
between
his
eyebrows
this
had
been
my
thought
when
i
first
saw
it
it
was
doubly
so
on
seeing
it
again
after
the
doubts
expressed
by
miss
graham
of
a
threatening
old
man
who
possessed
similar
characteristics
satisfied
on
this
point
i
turned
my
attention
to
what
still
more
seriously
occupied
it
the
three
or
four
long
rugs
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
across
the
whole
wall
at
my
left
evidently
concealed
the
mysterious
partition
put
up
in
ocumpaugh
father
time
directly
across
this
portion
of
the
room
was
it
a
totally
unbroken
partition
i
had
been
told
so
but
i
never
accept
such
assertions
without
a
personal
investigation
casting
a
glance
through
the
doorway
and
seeing
that
it
would
take
my
dreaming
friend
the
policeman
some
two
or
three
minutes
yet
to
find
his
way
back
to
his
post
i
hastily
lifted
these
rugs
aside
one
after
the
other
and
took
a
look
behind
them
a
stretch
of
georgia
pine
laid
as
i
readily
discovered
by
more
than
one
rap
of
my
knuckles
directly
over
the
bricks
it
was
intended
to
conceal
was
visible
under
each
from
end
to
end
a
plain
partition
with
no
indications
of
its
having
been
tampered
with
since
the
alterations
were
first
made
dismissing
from
my
mind
one
of
those
vague
possibilities
which
add
such
interest
to
the
calling
of
a
detective
i
left
the
place
with
my
full
thought
concentrated
on
the
definite
clue
i
had
received
from
the
but
i
had
not
walked
far
before
i
met
with
a
surprise
which
possibly
possessed
a
significance
equal
to
anything
i
had
already
observed
if
only
i
could
have
fully
understood
it
on
the
path
into
which
i
now
entered
i
encountered
again
the
figure
of
carew
her
face
was
turned
full
on
mine
and
she
had
evidently
retraced
her
steps
to
have
another
instant
conversation
with
me
the
next
moment
i
was
sure
of
this
her
eyes
always
magnetic
shone
with
increasing
brightness
as
i
advanced
to
meet
her
and
her
manner
while
grave
was
that
of
a
woman
quite
conscious
of
the
effect
she
produced
by
her
least
word
or
action
i
have
returned
to
tell
you
said
she
that
i
have
more
confidence
in
your
efforts
than
in
those
of
the
police
officers
around
here
if
gwendolen
fate
is
determined
by
any
one
it
will
be
by
you
so
i
want
to
be
of
aid
to
you
if
i
can
remember
that
i
may
have
said
this
to
you
before
but
i
wish
to
impress
it
upon
you
there
was
a
flutter
in
her
movements
which
astonished
me
she
was
surveying
me
in
a
straightforward
way
and
i
could
not
but
feel
the
fire
and
force
of
her
look
happily
she
was
no
longer
a
young
woman
or
i
might
have
misunderstood
the
disturbance
which
took
place
in
my
own
breast
as
i
waited
for
the
musical
tones
to
cease
you
are
very
good
i
rejoined
i
need
help
and
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
receive
your
assistance
yet
i
did
question
her
though
i
presently
found
myself
walking
toward
the
house
at
her
side
she
may
not
have
expected
me
to
presume
so
far
certainly
she
showed
no
dissatisfaction
when
at
a
parting
in
the
path
i
took
my
leave
of
her
and
turned
my
face
in
the
direction
of
the
gates
a
strange
sweet
woman
with
a
power
quite
apart
from
the
physical
charms
which
usually
affect
men
of
my
age
but
one
not
easily
read
nor
parted
from
unless
one
had
an
imperative
errand
as
i
had
this
errand
was
to
meet
and
forestall
the
messenger
boy
whom
i
momently
expected
with
the
answer
to
my
telegram
that
an
opportunity
for
gossip
was
likewise
afforded
by
the
motley
group
of
men
and
boys
drawn
up
near
one
of
the
gave
an
added
interest
to
the
event
which
i
was
quite
ready
to
appreciate
approaching
this
group
i
assimilated
myself
with
it
as
speedily
as
possible
and
having
some
tact
for
this
sort
of
thing
soon
found
myself
the
recipient
of
various
gratuitous
opinions
as
to
the
significance
of
the
find
which
had
offered
such
a
problem
both
to
the
professional
and
unprofessional
detective
two
shoes
had
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
by
any
chance
worn
such
no
or
the
ones
mating
them
would
have
been
found
in
her
closet
and
this
some
one
shouted
out
had
not
been
done
only
the
one
corresponding
to
that
fished
up
from
the
waters
of
the
dock
had
come
to
light
the
other
the
one
which
the
child
must
really
have
worn
was
no
nearer
being
found
than
the
child
herself
what
did
it
all
mean
no
one
knew
but
all
attempted
some
sort
of
hazardous
guess
which
i
was
happy
to
see
fell
entirely
short
of
the
mark
there
was
not
a
word
of
the
vindictive
old
man
described
by
miss
graham
till
i
myself
introduced
the
topic
my
reason
or
rather
my
excuse
for
introducing
it
was
this
on
the
near
me
i
had
observed
the
remnants
of
a
strip
of
paper
which
had
been
pasted
there
and
afterward
imperfectly
torn
off
it
had
an
unsightly
look
but
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
till
some
movement
in
the
group
forced
me
a
little
nearer
to
the
post
when
i
was
surprised
enough
to
see
that
this
scrap
of
paper
showed
signs
of
words
and
that
these
words
gave
evidence
of
being
a
date
written
in
the
very
hand
i
now
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
that
of
the
old
man
uppermost
in
my
own
mind
even
if
he
were
not
the
one
whom
miss
graham
had
seen
on
the
bridge
this
date
strange
to
say
was
the
same
significant
one
already
noted
on
the
floor
of
the
bungalow
a
fact
which
i
felt
merited
an
explanation
if
any
one
about
me
could
give
it
waiting
therefore
for
a
lull
in
the
remarks
passing
between
the
and
other
employees
about
the
place
i
drew
the
attention
of
the
first
man
who
would
listen
to
the
half
strip
of
paper
on
the
post
and
asked
if
that
was
the
way
the
ocumpaughs
gave
notice
of
their
entertainments
he
started
then
turned
his
back
on
me
that
was
put
there
for
the
entertainment
he
growled
that
was
pasted
up
there
by
some
one
who
wanted
to
show
off
his
writin
there
do
seem
to
be
no
other
reason
as
the
man
who
spoke
these
words
had
thereby
proved
himself
a
blockhead
i
edged
away
from
him
as
soon
as
possible
toward
a
very
decent
looking
fellow
who
appeared
to
have
more
brains
than
speech
do
you
know
who
pasted
that
date
upon
the
post
i
inquired
he
answered
very
directly
no
or
i
should
have
been
laying
for
him
long
before
this
why
it
is
not
only
there
you
can
see
it
i
found
it
pinned
to
the
carriage
cushions
one
day
just
as
i
was
going
to
drive
ocumpaugh
out
evidently
i
had
struck
upon
the
coachman
and
not
only
that
one
of
the
girls
up
at
the
house
one
as
i
knows
pretty
well
tells
me
i
care
who
hears
it
now
that
it
was
written
across
a
card
which
was
left
at
the
door
for
ocumpaugh
and
all
in
the
same
handwriting
which
is
not
a
common
one
as
you
can
see
this
means
something
seeing
it
was
the
date
when
our
bad
luck
fell
on
us
he
had
noted
that
you
do
mean
to
say
that
these
things
were
written
and
put
about
before
the
date
you
see
on
them
but
i
do
would
we
have
noticed
since
but
who
are
you
sir
if
i
may
ask
one
of
them
detective
fellows
if
so
i
have
a
word
to
say
find
that
child
or
ocumpaugh
blood
will
be
on
your
head
she
not
live
till
ocumpaugh
comes
home
unless
she
can
show
him
his
child
wait
i
called
out
for
he
was
turning
away
toward
the
stable
you
know
who
wrote
those
slips
not
a
bit
of
it
no
one
does
not
that
anybody
thinks
much
about
them
but
me
the
police
must
i
ventured
may
be
but
they
do
say
anything
about
it
somehow
it
looks
to
me
as
if
they
were
all
at
sea
possibly
they
are
i
remarked
letting
him
go
as
i
caught
sight
of
a
small
boy
coming
up
the
road
with
several
telegrams
in
his
hand
is
one
of
those
directed
to
robert
trevitt
i
asked
crowding
up
with
the
rest
as
his
small
form
was
allowed
to
slip
through
the
gate
spec
there
is
he
replied
looking
them
over
and
handing
me
one
i
carried
it
to
one
side
and
hastily
tore
it
open
it
was
as
i
expected
from
my
partner
and
read
as
follows
man
you
want
has
just
returned
after
two
days
absence
am
on
watch
saw
him
just
alight
from
buggy
with
what
looked
like
sleeping
child
in
his
arms
closed
and
fastened
front
door
after
him
safe
for
did
i
allow
my
triumph
to
betray
itself
i
do
not
think
so
the
question
which
kept
down
my
elation
was
this
would
i
be
the
first
man
to
get
there
v
the
old
house
in
yonkers
the
old
man
whose
handwriting
i
had
now
positively
identified
was
a
former
employer
of
mine
i
had
worked
in
his
office
when
a
lad
he
was
a
doctor
of
very
fair
reputation
in
westchester
county
and
i
recognized
every
characteristic
of
his
as
mentioned
by
miss
graham
save
the
frenzy
which
she
described
as
accompanying
his
address
in
those
days
he
was
calm
and
cold
and
while
outwardly
scrupulous
capable
of
forgetting
his
honor
as
a
physician
under
a
sufficiently
strong
temptation
i
had
left
him
when
new
prospects
opened
and
in
the
years
which
had
elapsed
had
contented
myself
with
the
knowledge
that
his
shingle
still
hung
out
in
yonkers
though
his
practice
was
nothing
to
what
it
used
to
be
when
i
was
in
his
employ
now
i
was
going
to
see
him
again
that
his
was
the
hand
which
had
stolen
gwendolen
seemed
no
longer
open
to
doubt
that
she
was
under
his
care
in
the
curious
old
house
i
remembered
in
the
heart
of
yonkers
seemed
equally
probable
but
why
so
sordid
a
man
one
who
loved
money
above
everything
else
in
the
world
should
retain
the
child
one
minute
after
the
publication
of
the
bountiful
reward
offered
by
ocumpaugh
was
what
i
could
not
at
first
understand
miss
graham
theory
of
hate
had
made
no
impression
on
me
he
was
heartless
and
not
likely
to
be
turned
aside
from
any
project
he
had
formed
but
he
was
not
what
i
considered
vindictive
where
nothing
was
to
be
gained
yet
my
comprehension
of
him
had
been
but
a
comprehension
and
i
was
now
prepared
to
put
a
very
different
estimate
on
one
whose
character
had
never
struck
me
as
being
an
open
one
even
when
my
own
had
been
most
credulous
that
my
enterprise
even
with
the
knowledge
i
possessed
of
this
man
promised
well
or
held
out
any
prospects
of
easy
fulfilment
i
no
longer
allowed
myself
to
think
if
money
was
his
object
and
what
other
could
influence
a
man
of
his
temperament
the
sum
offered
by
ocumpaugh
large
though
it
was
had
apparently
not
sufficed
to
satisfy
his
greed
he
was
holding
back
the
child
or
so
i
now
believed
in
order
to
wring
a
larger
possibly
a
double
amount
from
the
wretched
mother
fifty
thousand
was
a
goodly
sum
but
one
hundred
thousand
was
better
and
this
man
had
gigantic
ideas
where
his
cupidity
was
concerned
i
remember
how
firmly
he
had
once
stood
out
for
ten
thousand
dollars
when
he
had
been
offered
five
and
i
began
to
see
though
in
an
obscure
way
as
yet
how
it
might
very
easily
be
a
part
of
his
plan
to
work
ocumpaugh
up
to
a
positive
belief
in
the
child
death
before
he
came
down
upon
her
for
the
immense
reward
he
had
fixed
his
heart
upon
the
date
he
had
written
all
over
the
place
might
thus
find
some
explanation
in
a
plan
to
weaken
her
nerve
before
pressing
his
exorbitant
claims
upon
her
nothing
was
clear
yet
everything
was
possible
in
such
a
nature
and
anxious
to
enter
upon
the
struggle
both
for
my
own
sake
and
that
of
the
child
of
whose
condition
under
that
terrible
eye
i
scarcely
dared
to
think
i
left
homewood
in
haste
and
took
the
first
train
for
yonkers
though
the
distance
was
not
great
i
had
fully
arranged
my
plans
before
entering
the
town
where
so
many
of
my
boyish
years
had
been
spent
i
knew
the
old
fox
well
enough
or
thought
i
did
to
be
certain
that
i
should
have
anything
but
an
easy
entrance
into
his
house
in
case
it
still
harbored
the
child
whom
my
partner
had
seen
carried
in
there
i
anticipated
difficulties
but
was
concerned
about
none
but
the
possibility
of
not
being
able
to
bring
myself
face
to
face
with
him
once
in
his
presence
the
knowledge
which
i
secretly
possessed
of
an
old
but
doubtful
transaction
of
his
would
serve
to
make
him
mine
even
to
the
point
of
yielding
up
the
child
he
had
forcibly
abducted
but
would
he
accord
me
an
interview
could
i
without
appeal
to
the
police
and
you
can
readily
believe
i
was
not
anxious
to
allow
them
to
put
their
fingers
in
my
pie
force
him
to
open
his
door
and
let
me
into
his
house
which
as
i
well
recalled
he
locked
up
at
nine
after
which
he
would
receive
no
one
not
even
a
patient
it
was
not
nine
yet
but
it
was
very
near
that
hour
i
had
but
twenty
minutes
in
which
to
mount
the
hill
to
the
old
house
marked
by
the
doctor
sign
and
by
another
peculiarity
of
so
distinct
a
nature
that
it
would
serve
to
characterize
a
dwelling
in
a
city
as
large
as
new
york
though
i
doubt
if
new
york
can
show
its
like
from
the
battery
to
the
bronx
the
particulars
of
this
i
will
mention
later
i
have
first
to
relate
the
relief
i
felt
when
on
entering
the
old
neighborhood
i
heard
in
response
to
a
few
notes
of
a
certain
popular
melody
which
i
had
allowed
to
leave
my
lips
an
added
note
or
two
which
warned
me
that
my
partner
was
somewhere
hidden
among
the
alleys
of
this
very
unaristocratic
quarter
indeed
from
the
sound
i
judged
him
to
be
in
the
rear
of
the
doctor
house
and
being
anxious
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
before
advancing
upon
the
door
which
might
open
my
way
to
easy
fortune
or
complete
defeat
i
paused
a
few
steps
off
and
waited
for
his
appearance
he
was
at
my
elbow
before
i
had
either
seen
or
heard
him
he
was
always
light
of
foot
but
this
time
he
seemed
to
have
no
tread
at
all
still
here
was
his
comforting
assurance
both
i
whispered
back
both
any
one
else
no
a
boy
drove
away
the
buggy
and
has
not
come
back
sawbones
keeps
no
girl
is
the
child
quiet
has
there
been
no
alarm
not
a
breath
no
cops
in
the
neighborhood
no
spies
around
not
one
we
got
it
all
this
time
but
hush
there
nobody
yes
the
doctor
he
fastening
up
his
house
i
must
hasten
nothing
would
induce
me
to
let
that
innocent
remain
under
his
roof
all
night
it
not
the
windows
he
is
at
what
then
the
door
the
big
front
door
the
yes
i
gave
my
partner
a
surprised
look
undoubtedly
lost
in
the
darkness
and
drew
a
step
nearer
the
house
it
just
the
same
old
i
exclaimed
and
paused
for
an
instant
to
mark
the
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
the
surroundings
they
were
very
few
and
i
turned
back
to
fix
my
eye
on
the
front
door
where
a
rattling
sound
could
be
heard
as
of
some
one
fingering
the
latch
it
was
this
door
which
formed
the
peculiarity
of
the
house
in
itself
it
was
like
any
other
that
was
and
solid
but
it
opened
upon
space
that
is
if
it
was
ever
opened
which
i
doubted
the
stoop
and
even
the
railing
which
had
once
guarded
it
had
all
been
removed
leaving
a
bare
front
with
this
inhospitable
entrance
shut
against
every
one
who
had
not
the
convenience
for
mounting
to
it
by
a
ladder
there
was
another
way
in
but
this
was
round
on
one
side
and
did
not
present
itself
to
the
eye
unless
one
approached
from
the
west
end
of
the
street
so
that
to
half
the
the
house
looked
like
a
deserted
one
till
they
came
abreast
of
the
flagged
path
which
led
to
the
office
door
as
the
windows
had
never
been
unclosed
in
my
day
and
were
not
now
i
took
it
for
granted
that
they
had
remained
thus
inhospitably
shut
during
all
the
years
of
my
absence
which
certainly
offered
but
little
encouragement
to
a
man
bent
on
an
errand
which
would
soon
take
him
into
those
dismal
precincts
what
goes
on
behind
those
shuttered
windows
thought
i
i
know
of
one
thing
but
what
else
the
one
thing
was
the
counting
of
money
and
the
arranging
of
innumerable
gold
pieces
on
the
great
top
of
a
table
in
what
i
should
now
describe
as
the
back
parlor
i
remembered
how
he
used
to
do
it
i
caught
him
at
it
once
having
crept
up
one
windy
night
from
my
little
room
off
the
office
to
see
what
kept
the
doctor
up
so
late
as
i
now
stood
listening
in
the
dark
street
to
those
strange
touches
on
a
door
disused
for
years
i
recalled
the
tremor
with
which
i
rounded
the
top
of
the
stair
that
night
of
long
ago
and
the
mingled
fear
and
awe
with
which
i
recognized
not
only
such
a
mint
of
money
as
i
had
never
seen
out
of
the
bank
before
but
the
greedy
and
devouring
passion
with
which
he
pushed
the
glittering
coins
about
and
handled
the
and
gloated
over
the
pile
it
all
made
when
drawn
together
by
his
hooked
fingers
till
the
sound
perhaps
of
my
breathing
in
the
dark
hall
startled
him
with
a
thought
of
discovery
and
his
two
hands
came
together
over
that
pile
with
a
gesture
more
eloquent
even
than
the
look
with
which
he
seemed
to
penetrate
the
very
shadows
in
the
silent
space
wherein
i
stood
it
was
a
vision
short
but
inexpressibly
vivid
of
the
miser
incarnate
and
having
seen
it
and
escaped
detection
as
was
my
undeserved
luck
that
night
i
needed
never
to
ask
again
why
he
had
been
willing
to
accept
risks
from
which
most
men
shrink
from
fear
if
not
from
conscience
he
loved
money
not
as
the
spender
loves
it
openly
and
with
luxurious
instincts
but
secretly
and
with
a
knavish
dread
of
discovery
which
spoke
of
treasure
ill
acquired
and
now
he
was
seeking
to
add
to
his
gains
and
i
stood
on
the
outside
of
his
house
listening
to
sounds
i
did
not
understand
instead
of
attempting
to
draw
him
to
the
by
ringing
the
bell
he
never
used
to
disconnect
till
nine
do
you
know
that
i
do
quite
like
the
noises
which
are
being
made
up
there
came
in
a
sudden
whisper
to
my
ear
supposing
it
was
the
child
trying
to
get
out
she
does
not
know
there
is
no
stoop
she
seemed
sleeping
or
when
he
carried
her
in
and
if
by
any
chance
she
has
got
hold
of
the
key
and
the
door
should
open
hush
i
cried
starting
forward
in
horror
of
the
thought
he
had
suggested
it
opening
i
see
a
thread
of
light
what
does
it
mean
jupp
the
child
no
there
is
more
than
a
child
strength
in
that
push
hist
here
i
drew
him
flat
against
the
wall
the
door
above
had
swung
back
and
some
one
was
stamping
on
the
threshold
over
our
heads
in
what
appeared
to
be
an
outburst
of
ungovernable
fury
that
it
was
the
doctor
i
could
not
doubt
but
why
this
anger
why
this
mad
gasping
after
breath
and
the
with
which
he
faced
the
night
and
the
quiet
of
a
street
which
to
his
glance
passing
as
it
did
over
our
heads
must
have
appeared
altogether
deserted
we
were
consulting
each
other
faces
for
some
explanation
of
this
outbreak
when
the
door
above
us
suddenly
slammed
to
and
we
heard
a
renewal
of
that
fumbling
with
lock
and
key
which
had
first
drawn
our
attention
but
the
hand
was
not
sure
or
the
hall
was
dark
for
the
key
did
not
turn
in
the
lock
suddenly
awake
to
my
opportunity
i
wheeled
jupp
about
and
making
use
of
his
knee
and
back
climbed
up
till
i
was
enabled
to
reach
the
knob
and
turn
it
just
as
the
man
within
had
stepped
back
probably
to
procure
more
light
the
result
was
that
the
door
swung
open
and
i
stumbled
in
falling
almost
face
downward
on
the
marble
floor
faintly
checkered
off
to
my
sight
in
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
set
far
back
in
a
bare
and
dismal
hall
i
was
on
my
feet
again
in
an
instant
and
it
was
in
this
manner
and
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
a
hatless
head
and
a
disordered
countenance
that
i
encountered
again
my
old
employer
after
five
years
of
absence
he
did
not
recognize
me
i
saw
it
by
the
look
of
alarm
which
crossed
his
features
and
the
involuntary
opening
of
his
lips
in
what
would
certainly
have
been
a
loud
cry
if
i
had
not
smiled
and
cried
out
with
false
gaiety
excuse
me
doctor
i
never
came
in
by
that
door
before
pardon
my
awkwardness
the
step
is
somewhat
high
from
the
street
my
smile
is
my
own
they
say
at
all
events
it
served
to
enlighten
him
bob
trevitt
he
exclaimed
but
with
a
growl
of
displeasure
i
could
hardly
condemn
under
the
circumstances
i
hastened
to
push
my
advantage
for
he
was
looking
very
threateningly
toward
the
door
which
was
swaying
gently
and
in
an
inviting
way
to
a
man
who
if
old
had
more
power
in
his
arms
than
i
had
in
my
whole
body
trevitt
i
corrected
and
on
a
very
important
errand
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
ocumpaugh
whose
child
you
have
at
this
moment
under
your
roof
vi
doctor
pool
it
was
a
direct
attack
and
for
a
minute
i
doubted
if
i
had
not
made
a
mistake
in
making
it
so
suddenly
and
without
gloves
his
face
purpled
the
veins
on
his
forehead
started
out
his
great
form
shook
with
an
ire
that
in
such
domineering
natures
as
his
can
only
find
relief
in
a
blow
but
the
right
hand
did
not
rise
nor
the
heavy
fist
fall
with
admirable
he
faced
me
for
a
moment
without
attempting
either
protest
or
denial
then
his
blazing
eyes
cooled
down
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
which
at
once
relaxed
his
extreme
tension
of
nerve
and
muscle
he
pointed
toward
the
end
of
the
hall
and
remarked
with
studied
politeness
my
office
is
below
as
you
know
will
you
oblige
me
by
following
me
there
i
feared
him
for
i
saw
that
studiously
as
he
sought
to
hide
his
impressions
he
too
regarded
the
moment
as
one
of
critical
significance
but
i
assumed
an
air
of
perfect
confidence
merely
observing
as
i
left
the
neighborhood
of
the
front
door
and
the
proximity
of
jupp
i
have
friends
on
the
outside
who
are
waiting
for
me
so
you
must
not
keep
me
too
long
he
was
bending
to
take
up
the
lamp
from
a
small
table
near
the
basement
stair
as
i
threw
out
these
words
in
apparent
carelessness
and
the
flash
which
shot
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
was
thus
necessarily
heightened
by
the
glare
in
which
he
stood
yet
with
all
allowances
made
i
marked
him
down
in
my
own
mind
as
dangerous
and
was
correspondingly
surprised
when
he
turned
on
the
top
step
of
the
narrow
staircase
i
remembered
so
vividly
from
the
experience
i
have
before
named
and
in
the
mildest
of
accents
remarked
these
stairs
are
a
trifle
treacherous
be
careful
to
grasp
the
as
you
come
down
was
the
game
deeper
than
i
thought
in
all
my
remembrance
of
him
i
had
never
before
seen
him
look
benevolent
and
it
alarmed
me
coming
as
it
did
after
the
accusation
i
had
made
i
felt
tempted
to
make
a
stand
and
demand
that
the
interview
be
held
then
and
there
for
i
knew
his
subterranean
office
very
well
and
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
raise
a
cry
there
which
could
be
heard
by
any
one
outside
still
with
a
muttered
thank
you
i
proceeded
to
follow
him
down
only
stopping
once
in
the
descent
to
listen
for
some
sound
by
which
i
could
determine
in
which
room
of
the
many
i
knew
to
be
on
this
floor
the
little
one
lay
on
whose
behalf
i
was
incurring
a
possible
bullet
from
the
pistol
i
once
saw
lurking
amongst
bottles
and
corks
in
one
of
the
innumerable
drawers
of
the
doctor
table
but
all
was
still
around
and
overhead
too
still
for
my
peace
of
mind
in
which
dreadful
visions
began
to
rise
of
a
drugged
or
dying
child
panting
out
its
innocent
breath
in
darkness
and
solitude
yet
no
with
those
thousands
to
be
had
for
the
asking
any
man
would
be
a
fool
to
injure
or
even
seriously
to
frighten
a
child
upon
whose
good
condition
they
depended
much
less
a
miser
whose
whole
heart
was
fixed
on
money
the
clock
struck
as
i
put
foot
on
the
landing
so
much
can
happen
in
twenty
minutes
when
events
crowd
and
the
passions
of
men
reach
their
i
expected
to
see
the
old
man
try
that
door
even
to
double
bolt
it
as
in
the
years
gone
by
but
he
merely
threw
a
look
that
way
and
proceeded
on
down
the
three
or
four
steps
which
led
into
the
species
of
basement
where
he
had
chosen
to
fix
his
office
in
another
moment
that
dim
and
dismal
room
broke
upon
my
view
under
the
vague
light
of
the
small
and
lamp
he
carried
i
saw
again
its
musty
walls
covered
with
books
where
there
were
shelves
laden
with
bottles
and
a
loose
array
of
miscellaneous
objects
i
had
often
handled
but
out
of
which
i
never
could
make
any
meaning
i
recognized
it
all
and
detected
but
few
changes
but
these
were
startling
ones
the
old
lounge
standing
under
the
two
barred
windows
which
i
had
often
likened
in
my
own
mind
to
those
of
a
jail
had
been
recovered
and
lying
on
the
table
which
i
had
always
regarded
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
apprehension
i
perceived
something
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
a
bible
with
its
edges
worn
and
its
leaves
rumpled
as
if
often
and
eagerly
handled
i
was
so
struck
by
this
last
discovery
that
i
stopped
staring
in
the
doorway
looking
from
the
sacred
volume
to
his
worn
but
vigorous
figure
drawn
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
lamp
still
in
his
hand
and
his
small
but
brilliant
eyes
fixed
upon
mine
with
a
certain
ironical
glitter
in
them
which
gave
me
my
first
distrust
of
the
part
i
had
come
there
to
play
we
will
waste
no
words
said
he
setting
down
the
lamp
and
seizing
with
his
disengaged
hand
the
long
locks
of
his
flowing
beard
in
what
respect
are
you
a
messenger
from
ocumpaugh
and
what
makes
you
think
i
have
her
child
in
this
house
i
found
it
easier
to
answer
the
last
question
first
i
know
the
child
is
here
i
replied
because
my
partner
saw
you
bring
her
in
i
have
gone
into
the
detective
business
since
leaving
you
ah
there
was
an
astonishing
edge
to
his
smile
and
i
felt
that
i
should
have
to
make
the
most
of
that
old
discovery
of
mine
if
i
were
to
hold
my
own
with
this
man
and
may
i
ask
he
coldly
continued
how
you
have
succeeded
in
connecting
me
with
this
young
child
disappearance
it
straight
as
a
string
i
retorted
you
threatened
the
child
to
its
face
in
the
hearing
of
its
nurse
some
two
weeks
ago
on
a
certain
bridge
where
you
stopped
them
you
even
set
the
day
when
the
little
gwendolen
should
pass
from
luxury
to
poverty
here
i
cast
an
involuntary
glance
about
the
room
where
the
only
sign
of
comfort
was
the
newly
upholstered
lounge
that
day
was
the
sixteenth
and
we
all
know
what
happened
on
that
date
if
this
is
not
plain
enough
i
had
seen
his
lip
curl
allow
me
to
add
by
way
of
explanation
that
you
have
seen
fit
to
threaten
ocumpaugh
herself
with
this
date
for
i
know
well
the
hand
which
wrote
on
the
bungalow
floor
and
in
various
other
places
about
homewood
where
her
eye
was
likely
to
fall
and
i
let
my
own
fall
on
a
sort
of
manuscript
lying
open
not
far
from
the
bible
which
still
looked
so
out
of
place
to
me
on
this
old
miser
table
such
chirography
as
yours
is
not
to
be
mistaken
i
completed
with
a
short
gesture
toward
the
disordered
sheets
he
had
left
spread
out
to
every
eye
i
see
a
detective
without
doubt
did
you
play
the
detective
here
the
last
question
leaped
like
a
shot
from
his
lips
you
have
not
denied
the
threats
to
which
i
have
just
called
your
attention
was
my
cautious
reply
what
need
of
that
he
retorted
are
you
not
a
there
was
sarcasm
as
well
as
taunt
in
the
way
he
uttered
that
last
word
i
was
conscious
of
being
at
a
loss
but
put
a
bold
front
on
the
matter
and
proceeded
as
if
conscious
of
no
secret
misgiving
can
you
deny
as
well
that
you
have
been
gone
two
days
from
this
place
that
during
this
time
a
doctor
buggy
drawn
by
a
horse
i
should
know
by
description
having
harnessed
him
three
times
a
day
for
two
years
was
seen
by
more
than
one
observer
in
the
wake
of
a
mysterious
wagon
from
the
interior
of
which
a
child
crying
could
be
heard
the
wagon
did
not
drive
up
to
this
house
but
the
buggy
did
and
from
it
you
carried
a
child
which
you
brought
with
you
into
this
house
with
a
sudden
of
his
old
but
powerful
hand
on
the
top
of
the
table
before
him
he
seemed
about
to
utter
an
oath
or
some
angry
invective
but
again
he
controlled
himself
and
eying
me
without
any
show
of
shame
or
even
of
desire
to
contradict
any
of
my
assertions
he
quietly
declared
you
are
after
that
reward
i
observe
well
you
wo
get
it
like
many
others
of
your
class
you
can
follow
a
trail
but
the
insight
to
start
right
and
to
end
in
triumphant
success
is
given
only
to
a
genius
and
you
are
not
a
genius
with
a
blush
i
could
not
control
i
advanced
upon
him
crying
you
have
forestalled
me
you
have
telegraphed
or
telephoned
to
atwater
i
have
not
left
my
house
since
i
came
in
here
three
hours
ago
then
i
began
but
he
hushed
me
with
a
look
it
is
not
a
matter
of
money
he
declared
almost
with
dignity
those
who
think
to
reap
dollars
from
the
distress
which
has
come
upon
the
ocumpaugh
family
will
eat
ashes
for
their
pains
money
will
be
spent
but
none
of
it
earned
unless
you
or
such
as
you
are
hired
at
so
much
an
hour
to
follow
trails
greatly
astounded
not
only
by
the
attitude
he
took
but
by
the
calm
and
almost
indifferent
way
in
which
he
mentioned
what
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
to
be
the
one
burning
object
of
his
existence
i
surveyed
him
with
undisguised
astonishment
till
another
thought
growing
out
of
the
silence
of
the
house
above
us
gripped
me
with
secret
dread
and
i
exclaimed
aloud
and
without
any
attempt
at
subterfuge
she
is
dead
then
the
child
is
dead
i
do
not
know
was
his
reply
the
four
words
were
uttered
with
undeniable
gloom
you
do
not
know
i
echoed
conscious
that
my
jaw
had
fallen
and
that
i
was
staring
at
him
with
fright
in
my
eyes
no
i
wish
i
did
i
would
give
half
of
my
small
savings
to
know
where
that
innocent
baby
is
sit
down
he
vehemently
commanded
you
do
not
understand
me
i
see
you
confound
the
old
doctor
pool
with
the
new
i
confound
nothing
i
violently
retorted
in
strong
revulsion
against
what
i
had
now
come
to
look
upon
as
the
attempt
of
a
subtile
actor
to
turn
aside
my
suspicions
and
brave
out
a
dangerous
situation
by
a
ridiculous
subterfuge
i
understand
the
miser
whom
i
have
beheld
gloating
over
his
hoard
in
the
room
above
and
i
understand
the
doctor
who
for
money
could
lend
himself
to
a
fraud
the
secret
results
of
which
are
agitating
the
whole
country
at
this
moment
so
the
word
came
with
difficulty
so
you
play
the
detective
even
as
a
boy
pity
i
had
not
recognized
your
talents
at
the
time
but
no
he
contradicted
himself
with
great
rapidity
i
was
not
a
redeemed
soul
then
i
might
have
done
you
harm
i
might
have
had
more
if
not
worse
sins
to
atone
for
than
i
have
now
and
with
scant
appearance
of
having
noted
the
doubtful
manner
in
which
i
had
received
this
astonishing
outburst
he
proceeded
to
cry
aloud
and
with
a
commanding
gesture
quit
this
you
have
undertaken
more
than
you
can
handle
you
a
messenger
from
ocumpaugh
never
you
are
but
the
messenger
of
your
own
cupidity
and
cupidity
leads
by
the
straightest
of
roads
directly
down
to
hell
this
you
proved
six
long
years
ago
lead
me
to
the
child
i
believe
to
be
in
this
house
or
i
will
proclaim
aloud
the
pact
you
entered
into
then
a
pact
to
which
i
was
an
involuntary
witness
whose
word
however
will
not
go
for
less
on
that
account
behind
the
curtain
still
hanging
over
that
old
closet
i
stood
while
his
hand
had
seized
my
arm
with
a
grip
few
could
have
proceeded
under
do
you
mean
the
rest
was
whispered
in
my
ear
i
nodded
and
felt
that
he
was
mine
now
but
the
laugh
which
the
next
minute
broke
from
his
lips
dashed
my
assurance
oh
the
ways
of
the
world
he
cried
then
in
a
different
tone
and
not
without
reverence
oh
the
ways
of
god
i
made
no
reply
for
every
reason
i
felt
that
the
next
word
must
come
from
him
it
was
an
unexpected
one
that
was
doctor
pool
unregenerate
and
more
heedful
of
the
things
of
this
world
than
of
those
of
the
world
to
come
you
have
to
deal
with
quite
a
different
man
now
it
is
of
that
very
sin
i
am
now
repenting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
i
live
but
to
expiate
it
something
has
been
done
toward
accomplishing
this
but
not
enough
i
have
been
played
upon
used
this
i
will
avenge
new
sin
is
a
poor
apology
for
an
old
one
i
scarcely
heeded
him
i
was
again
straining
my
ears
to
catch
a
smothered
sob
or
a
frightened
moan
what
are
you
listening
for
he
asked
for
the
sound
of
little
gwendolen
voice
it
is
worth
fifty
thousand
dollars
you
remember
why
should
i
listen
for
it
besides
i
have
a
real
and
uncontrollable
sympathy
for
the
child
i
am
determined
to
restore
her
to
her
home
your
blasphemous
babble
of
a
changed
heart
does
not
affect
me
you
are
after
a
larger
haul
than
the
sum
offered
by
ocumpaugh
you
want
some
of
ocumpaugh
fortune
i
have
suspected
it
from
the
first
i
want
little
you
know
what
i
want
then
quickly
convincingly
you
are
strangely
deceived
little
miss
ocumpaugh
is
not
here
what
is
that
i
hear
then
was
the
quick
retort
with
which
i
hailed
the
sigh
unmistakably
from
infantile
lips
which
now
rose
from
some
place
very
much
nearer
us
than
the
hollow
regions
overhead
toward
which
my
ears
had
been
so
long
turned
that
he
flashed
with
uncontrollable
passion
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
clenched
his
hands
so
violently
as
to
bury
his
nails
in
his
flesh
would
you
like
to
see
what
that
is
come
and
taking
up
the
lamp
he
moved
much
to
my
surprise
as
well
as
to
my
intense
interest
toward
the
door
of
the
small
cupboard
where
i
had
myself
slept
when
in
his
service
that
he
still
meditated
some
deviltry
which
would
call
for
my
full
presence
of
mind
to
combat
successfully
i
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
yet
the
agitation
under
which
i
crossed
the
floor
was
more
the
result
of
an
immediate
anticipation
of
seeing
and
in
this
place
of
all
others
in
the
world
the
child
about
whom
my
thoughts
had
clung
so
persistently
for
hours
than
of
any
results
to
myself
in
the
way
of
injury
or
misfortune
though
the
room
was
small
and
my
passage
across
it
necessarily
short
i
had
time
to
remember
ocumpaugh
pitiful
countenance
as
i
saw
it
gazing
in
agony
of
expectation
from
her
window
overlooking
the
river
and
to
catch
again
the
sounds
less
true
and
yet
strangely
thrilling
of
carew
voice
as
she
said
a
tragedy
at
my
doors
and
i
occupied
with
my
own
affairs
nor
was
this
all
a
recollection
of
miss
graham
sorrow
came
up
before
my
eyes
also
and
truest
of
all
most
penetrating
to
me
of
all
the
loves
which
seemed
to
encompass
this
rare
and
winsome
infant
the
infinite
tenderness
with
which
i
once
saw
ocumpaugh
lift
her
to
his
breast
during
one
of
my
interviews
with
him
at
homewood
all
this
before
the
door
had
swung
open
afterward
i
saw
nothing
and
thought
of
nothing
but
the
small
figure
lying
in
the
spot
where
i
had
once
pillowed
my
own
head
and
with
no
more
luxuries
or
even
comforts
about
her
than
had
been
my
lot
under
this
broad
but
by
no
means
hospitable
roof
a
bare
wall
a
narrow
cot
a
table
with
a
bottle
and
glass
on
it
and
the
child
in
the
bed
that
was
all
but
god
knows
it
was
enough
to
me
at
that
breathless
moment
and
advancing
eagerly
i
was
about
to
stoop
over
the
little
head
sunk
deep
in
its
pillow
when
the
old
man
stepped
between
and
with
a
short
laugh
remarked
there
no
such
hurry
i
have
something
to
say
first
in
explanation
of
the
anger
you
have
seen
me
display
an
anger
which
is
unseemly
in
a
man
professing
to
have
conquered
the
sins
and
passions
of
lost
humanity
i
did
follow
this
child
you
were
right
in
saying
that
it
was
my
horse
and
buggy
which
were
seen
in
the
wake
of
the
wagon
which
came
from
the
region
of
homewood
and
lost
itself
in
the
running
between
the
north
river
and
the
sound
for
two
days
and
a
night
i
followed
it
through
more
difficulties
than
i
could
relate
in
an
hour
stopping
in
lonely
woods
or
at
wretched
taverns
watching
waiting
for
the
transfer
of
the
child
whose
destination
i
was
bound
to
know
even
if
it
cost
me
a
week
of
miserable
travel
without
comfortable
food
or
decent
lodging
i
could
hear
the
child
cry
out
from
time
to
time
an
assurance
that
i
was
not
following
a
but
not
till
not
till
very
late
did
any
words
pass
between
me
and
the
man
and
woman
who
drove
the
wagon
at
fordham
just
as
i
suspected
them
of
making
final
efforts
to
escape
me
they
came
to
a
halt
and
i
saw
the
man
get
out
i
immediately
got
out
too
as
we
faced
each
other
i
demanded
what
the
matter
was
he
appeared
reckless
you
a
doctor
he
asked
i
assured
him
that
i
was
at
which
he
blurted
out
do
know
why
you
been
following
us
so
long
and
i
do
care
i
got
a
job
for
you
a
child
in
our
wagon
is
with
a
start
i
attempted
to
look
over
the
old
man
shoulder
toward
the
bed
but
the
deep
if
irregular
breathing
of
the
child
reassured
me
and
i
turned
to
hear
the
doctor
out
this
gave
me
my
chance
me
see
her
i
cried
the
man
eye
lowered
i
did
not
like
his
face
at
all
it
anything
serious
he
growled
shall
cut
it
is
my
flesh
and
blood
nor
yet
my
old
woman
there
you
have
to
find
some
place
for
the
brat
besides
my
wagon
if
it
anything
that
wo
get
cured
without
so
come
along
and
have
a
look
i
followed
him
perfectly
determined
to
take
the
child
under
my
own
care
sick
or
well
were
you
going
to
take
her
i
asked
i
did
ask
who
she
was
why
should
i
do
know
as
i
am
obliged
to
tell
was
his
surly
reply
we
are
going
oursel
he
reluctantly
added
not
to
i
no
time
for
brats
nor
my
wife
neither
we
have
a
journey
to
make
sarah
this
to
his
wife
for
by
this
time
we
were
beside
the
wagon
up
the
flap
and
hold
the
youngster
hand
out
here
a
doctor
who
will
tell
us
if
it
fever
or
not
a
puny
hand
and
wrist
were
thrust
out
i
felt
the
pulse
and
then
held
out
my
arms
me
the
child
i
commanded
sick
enough
for
a
hospital
a
grunt
from
the
woman
within
an
oath
from
the
man
and
a
bundle
was
presently
put
in
my
arms
from
which
a
little
moan
escaped
as
i
strode
with
it
toward
my
buggy
do
not
ask
your
name
i
called
back
to
the
man
who
reluctantly
followed
me
is
doctor
pool
and
i
live
in
yonkers
he
muttered
something
about
not
peachin
on
a
poor
man
who
was
really
an
unfortunate
a
kindness
and
then
slunk
hurriedly
back
and
was
gone
wagon
wife
and
all
by
the
time
i
had
whipped
up
my
tired
old
nag
and
turned
about
toward
yonkers
but
i
had
the
child
safe
and
sound
in
my
arms
and
my
fears
of
its
fate
were
relieved
it
was
not
well
but
i
anticipated
nothing
serious
when
it
moaned
i
pressed
it
a
little
closer
to
my
breast
and
that
was
all
in
of
an
hour
we
were
in
yonkers
in
fifteen
minutes
i
had
it
on
this
bed
and
had
begun
to
unroll
the
shawl
in
which
it
was
closely
wrapped
did
you
ever
see
the
child
about
whom
there
has
been
all
this
coil
yes
about
three
years
ago
three
years
i
have
seen
her
within
a
fortnight
yet
i
could
carry
that
young
one
in
my
arms
for
a
whole
hour
without
the
least
suspicion
that
i
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
quickly
slipping
aside
he
allowed
me
to
approach
the
bed
and
take
my
first
look
at
the
sleeping
child
face
it
was
a
sweet
one
but
i
did
not
need
the
hint
he
had
given
me
to
find
the
features
strange
and
lacking
every
characteristic
of
those
of
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
yet
as
the
cutting
off
of
the
hair
will
often
change
the
whole
aspect
of
the
face
and
this
child
hair
was
short
i
was
stooping
in
great
excitement
to
notice
more
particularly
the
contour
of
cheek
and
chin
which
had
given
individuality
to
the
little
heiress
when
the
doctor
touched
me
on
the
arm
and
drew
my
attention
to
a
pair
of
little
trousers
and
a
shirt
which
were
hanging
on
the
door
behind
me
those
are
the
clothes
i
came
upon
under
that
great
shawl
the
child
i
have
been
following
and
whom
i
have
brought
into
my
house
under
the
impression
it
was
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
is
not
even
a
girl
vii
find
the
child
i
could
well
understand
the
wrath
to
which
this
man
had
given
way
by
the
feeling
which
now
took
hold
of
my
own
breast
a
boy
i
exclaimed
a
boy
still
incredulous
i
leaned
over
the
child
and
lifted
into
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
one
of
the
little
hands
i
saw
lying
outside
of
the
coverlet
there
was
no
mistaking
it
for
a
girl
hand
let
alone
a
little
lady
so
we
are
both
fools
i
vociferated
in
my
unbounded
indignation
careful
however
to
lay
the
small
hand
gently
back
on
the
panting
breast
and
turning
away
both
from
the
doctor
and
his
small
patient
i
strolled
back
into
the
office
the
bubble
whose
gay
colors
i
had
followed
with
such
avidity
had
burst
in
my
face
with
a
vengeance
but
once
from
under
the
influence
of
the
doctor
sarcastic
eye
my
better
nature
reasserted
itself
wheeling
about
i
threw
this
question
back
if
that
is
a
boy
and
a
stranger
where
is
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
a
moan
from
the
bed
and
a
hurried
movement
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
who
took
this
opportunity
to
give
the
child
another
dose
of
medicine
were
my
sole
response
waiting
till
the
doctor
had
finished
his
task
and
drawn
back
from
the
bedside
i
repeated
the
question
and
with
increased
emphasis
where
then
is
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
still
the
doctor
did
not
answer
though
he
turned
my
way
and
even
stepped
forward
his
long
visage
cadaverous
from
fatigue
and
the
shock
of
his
disappointment
growing
more
and
more
somber
as
he
advanced
when
he
came
to
a
stand
by
the
table
i
asked
again
where
is
the
child
idolized
by
ocumpaugh
and
mourned
to
such
a
degree
by
his
almost
maddened
wife
that
they
say
she
will
die
if
the
little
girl
is
not
found
the
threat
in
my
tones
brought
a
response
at
last
a
response
which
astonished
me
have
i
not
said
that
i
do
not
know
do
you
not
believe
me
do
you
think
me
as
blind
to
truth
and
honor
as
i
was
six
years
ago
have
you
no
idea
of
repentance
and
regeneration
from
sin
you
are
a
detective
find
me
that
child
you
shall
have
money
hundreds
thousands
if
you
can
bring
me
proofs
of
her
being
yet
alive
if
the
hudson
has
swallowed
her
here
his
figure
rose
dilated
and
took
on
a
majesty
which
impressed
itself
upon
me
through
all
my
doubts
i
will
have
vengeance
on
whoever
has
thus
dared
the
laws
of
god
and
man
as
i
would
on
the
foulest
murderer
in
the
foulest
slums
of
that
city
which
breeds
wickedness
in
high
places
as
in
low
i
lock
hands
no
longer
with
belial
find
me
the
child
or
make
me
at
least
to
know
the
truth
there
was
no
doubting
the
passion
which
drove
these
words
hot
from
his
lips
i
recognized
at
last
the
fanatic
whom
miss
graham
had
so
graphically
described
in
relating
her
extraordinary
adventure
on
the
bridge
and
met
him
with
this
one
question
which
was
certainly
a
vital
one
who
dropped
a
shoe
from
the
little
one
closet
into
the
water
under
the
dock
did
you
no
his
reply
came
quick
and
sharp
but
i
insisted
you
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
disappearance
he
did
not
answer
a
sullen
look
was
displacing
the
fire
of
resolve
in
the
eyes
i
saw
sinking
slowly
before
mine
i
will
not
acknowledge
it
he
muttered
adding
however
in
what
was
little
short
of
a
growl
not
yet
not
till
it
becomes
my
duty
to
avenge
innocent
blood
you
foretold
the
date
drop
it
you
were
in
league
with
the
abductor
i
persisted
i
declare
to
your
face
in
spite
of
all
the
vaunted
scruples
with
which
you
seek
to
blind
me
to
your
guilt
that
you
were
in
league
with
the
abductor
knowing
what
money
ocumpaugh
would
pay
only
he
was
too
smart
for
you
and
perhaps
too
unscrupulous
you
would
stop
short
of
murder
now
that
you
have
got
religion
but
his
conscience
is
not
so
nice
and
so
you
fear
you
do
not
know
what
i
fear
and
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
it
is
enough
that
i
am
conscious
of
my
own
uprightness
and
that
i
say
find
the
child
you
have
incentive
enough
it
was
true
and
it
was
growing
stronger
every
minute
confine
yourself
to
such
clues
as
are
apparent
to
every
eye
he
now
admonished
me
with
an
eagerness
that
seemed
real
if
they
are
pointed
by
some
special
knowledge
you
believe
yourself
to
have
gained
that
is
all
the
better
perhaps
i
do
not
propose
to
say
i
saw
that
he
had
uttered
his
ultimatum
very
good
said
i
i
have
nevertheless
one
more
question
to
ask
which
relates
to
those
very
clues
you
can
not
refuse
to
answer
it
if
you
are
really
desirous
of
aiding
me
in
my
efforts
where
did
you
first
come
upon
the
wagon
which
you
followed
so
many
hours
in
the
belief
that
it
held
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
he
mused
a
moment
with
downcast
head
his
nervous
frame
trembling
with
the
force
with
which
he
threw
his
whole
weight
on
the
hand
he
held
outspread
on
the
table
before
him
then
he
calmly
replied
i
will
tell
you
that
at
the
gate
of
carew
grounds
you
know
them
they
adjoin
the
ocumpaughs
on
the
left
my
surprise
made
me
lower
my
head
but
not
so
quickly
that
i
did
not
catch
the
oblique
glint
of
his
eye
as
he
mentioned
the
name
which
i
was
so
little
prepared
to
hear
in
this
connection
i
was
in
my
buggy
on
the
highroad
he
continued
there
was
a
constant
passing
by
of
all
kinds
of
vehicles
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
ocumpaugh
entertainment
but
none
that
attracted
my
attention
till
i
caught
sight
of
the
covered
wagon
i
have
endeavored
to
describe
being
driven
out
of
the
adjoining
grounds
then
i
pricked
up
my
ears
for
a
child
was
crying
inside
in
the
smothered
way
that
tells
of
a
hand
laid
heavily
over
the
mouth
i
thought
i
knew
what
child
this
was
but
you
have
been
a
witness
to
my
disappointment
after
hours
of
travel
behind
that
wretched
wagon
it
came
out
of
carew
grounds
i
repeated
ignoring
everything
but
the
one
important
fact
and
during
the
time
you
say
when
ocumpaugh
guests
were
assembling
did
you
see
any
other
vehicle
leave
by
the
same
gate
at
or
before
that
time
yes
a
carriage
it
appeared
to
have
no
one
in
it
indeed
i
know
that
it
was
empty
for
i
peered
into
it
as
it
rolled
by
me
down
the
street
of
course
i
do
not
know
what
might
have
been
under
the
seats
nothing
was
my
sharp
retort
that
was
the
carriage
in
which
carew
had
come
up
from
the
train
did
it
pass
out
before
the
wagon
yes
by
some
minutes
there
is
nothing
then
to
be
gained
by
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
was
his
accent
in
uttering
this
simple
phrase
peculiar
i
looked
up
to
make
sure
but
his
face
which
had
been
eloquent
with
one
feeling
or
another
during
every
minute
of
this
long
interview
till
the
present
instant
looked
strangely
impassive
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
press
the
question
hovering
on
my
lips
you
have
given
me
a
heavy
task
i
finally
remarked
and
you
offer
very
little
assistance
in
the
way
of
conjecture
yet
you
must
have
formed
some
he
toyed
with
his
beard
combing
it
with
his
nervous
muscular
fingers
and
as
i
watched
how
he
lingered
over
the
tips
caressing
them
before
he
dropped
them
i
felt
that
he
was
toying
with
my
perplexities
in
much
the
same
fashion
and
with
an
equal
satisfaction
angry
and
out
of
all
patience
with
him
i
blurted
out
i
will
do
without
your
aid
i
will
solve
this
mystery
and
earn
your
money
if
not
that
of
ocumpaugh
with
no
assistance
save
that
afforded
by
my
own
wits
i
expect
you
will
he
retorted
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
burst
in
upon
him
like
one
dropping
from
the
clouds
through
the
unapproachable
doorway
on
the
upper
floor
he
lost
that
look
of
extreme
tension
which
had
nerved
his
aged
figure
into
something
of
the
aspect
of
youth
with
it
vanished
his
impressiveness
it
was
simply
a
tired
old
man
i
now
followed
upstairs
to
the
side
door
as
i
paused
to
give
him
a
final
nod
and
an
assurance
of
intended
good
faith
toward
him
he
made
a
kindly
enough
gesture
in
the
direction
of
my
old
room
below
and
said
do
worry
about
the
little
fellow
down
there
he
come
out
all
right
i
sha
visit
on
him
the
extravagance
of
my
own
folly
i
am
a
christian
now
and
with
this
encouraging
remark
he
closed
the
door
and
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
dark
alley
my
first
sense
of
relief
came
from
the
coolness
of
the
night
air
on
my
flushed
forehead
and
cheeks
after
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
this
underground
room
reeking
with
the
fumes
of
the
lamp
and
the
heat
of
a
struggle
which
his
dogged
confidence
in
himself
had
made
so
unequal
it
was
pleasurable
just
to
sense
the
quiet
and
the
cool
of
the
night
and
feel
myself
released
from
the
bondage
of
a
presence
from
which
i
had
frequently
recoiled
but
had
never
thoroughly
felt
the
force
of
till
my
next
from
the
touch
and
voice
of
my
partner
who
at
that
moment
rose
from
before
the
basement
windows
where
he
had
evidently
been
lying
for
a
long
time
outstretched
what
have
you
two
been
doing
down
there
was
his
very
natural
complaint
i
tried
to
listen
i
tried
to
see
but
beyond
a
few
scattered
words
when
your
voices
rose
to
an
excited
pitch
i
have
learned
nothing
but
that
you
were
in
no
danger
save
from
the
overthrow
of
your
scheme
that
has
failed
has
it
not
you
would
have
interrupted
me
long
ago
if
you
had
found
the
child
yes
i
acknowledged
drawing
him
down
the
alley
i
have
failed
for
but
i
start
afresh
though
how
i
can
rest
idle
for
nine
hours
not
knowing
under
what
roof
if
under
any
that
doomed
innocent
may
be
lying
i
do
not
know
you
must
rest
you
are
staggering
with
fatigue
now
not
a
bit
of
it
only
with
uncertainty
i
do
see
my
way
let
us
go
down
street
and
see
if
any
news
has
come
over
the
wires
since
i
left
homewood
but
first
what
a
spooky
old
house
that
is
and
what
did
the
old
gentleman
have
to
say
of
your
tumbling
in
on
him
from
space
without
a
your
leave
or
even
an
me
tell
me
about
it
i
told
him
enough
to
allay
his
curiosity
that
was
all
i
thought
necessary
and
he
seemed
satisfied
jupp
is
a
good
fellow
quite
willing
to
confine
himself
to
his
particular
end
of
the
business
which
does
not
include
the
thinking
end
why
should
it
there
was
no
news
this
we
soon
learned
only
some
hints
of
a
contemplated
move
on
the
part
of
the
police
in
a
district
where
some
low
characters
had
been
seen
dragging
along
a
resisting
child
of
an
unexpectedly
refined
appearance
as
no
one
could
describe
this
child
and
as
i
had
refused
from
the
first
to
look
upon
this
case
as
one
of
ordinary
abduction
i
laid
little
stress
on
the
report
destined
though
it
was
to
appear
under
startling
on
the
morrow
and
startled
my
more
credulous
partner
quite
out
of
his
usual
equanimity
by
ordering
him
on
our
arrival
at
the
station
to
buy
me
a
ticket
for
as
i
was
going
back
to
homewood
to
homewood
so
late
exactly
it
will
not
be
late
there
or
if
it
is
anxious
hearts
make
light
sleepers
his
shoulders
rose
a
trifle
but
he
bought
the
ticket
viii
philo
philo
philo
never
have
i
felt
a
weirder
sensation
than
when
i
stepped
from
the
cars
on
to
the
solitary
platform
from
which
a
few
hours
before
i
had
seen
the
little
depart
for
new
york
the
train
soon
to
disappear
in
the
darkness
of
the
long
perspective
was
all
that
gave
life
and
light
to
the
scene
and
when
it
was
gone
nothing
remained
to
relieve
the
gloom
or
to
break
the
universal
stillness
save
the
quiet
lap
of
the
water
and
the
moaning
of
the
wind
through
the
trees
which
climbed
the
heights
to
homewood
i
had
determined
to
enter
if
possible
by
way
of
the
private
path
though
i
expected
to
find
it
guarded
against
just
such
intrusion
in
approaching
it
i
was
given
a
full
view
of
the
river
and
thus
was
in
a
position
to
note
that
the
dock
and
adjoining
banks
were
no
longer
bright
with
lanterns
in
the
hands
of
eager
men
bending
with
fixed
eyes
over
the
flowing
waters
the
search
which
had
kept
so
many
busy
at
this
spot
for
well
on
to
two
days
had
been
abandoned
and
the
darkness
seemed
doubly
dark
and
the
silence
doubly
oppressive
in
contrast
yet
hope
spoke
in
the
abandonment
and
with
renewed
spirit
and
a
more
than
lively
courage
i
turned
toward
the
little
gate
through
which
i
had
passed
twice
before
that
day
as
i
expected
a
silent
figure
rose
up
from
the
shadows
to
prevent
me
but
it
fell
back
at
the
mention
of
my
name
and
business
thus
proving
the
man
to
be
in
the
confidence
of
ocumpaugh
or
at
the
least
in
that
of
miss
porter
i
am
come
for
a
social
chat
with
the
coachman
i
explained
lights
burn
late
in
such
extensive
stables
do
worry
about
me
the
people
at
the
house
are
in
sympathy
with
my
investigation
thus
we
stretch
the
truth
at
great
crises
i
know
you
was
the
answer
but
keep
away
from
the
house
our
orders
are
imperative
to
allow
no
one
to
approach
it
again
except
with
the
child
in
hand
or
with
such
news
as
would
gain
instant
admission
trust
me
said
i
as
i
went
up
the
steps
it
was
so
dark
between
the
that
my
ascent
became
mere
groping
i
had
a
lantern
in
my
pocket
which
i
had
taken
from
jupp
but
i
did
not
choose
to
make
use
of
it
i
preferred
to
go
on
and
up
trusting
to
my
instinct
to
tell
me
when
i
had
reached
a
fresh
flight
of
steps
a
gleam
of
light
from
carew
upper
windows
was
the
first
intimation
i
received
that
i
was
at
the
top
of
the
bank
and
in
another
moment
i
was
opposite
the
gap
in
the
hedge
opening
upon
her
grounds
for
no
particular
reason
that
i
know
of
i
here
paused
and
took
a
long
survey
of
what
was
after
all
nothing
but
a
cluster
of
shadows
broken
here
and
there
by
squares
of
subdued
light
i
felt
a
vague
desire
to
enter
to
see
and
talk
again
with
the
charming
woman
whose
personality
had
made
such
an
impression
upon
me
if
only
to
understand
the
peculiar
feelings
which
those
indistinguishable
walls
awakened
and
why
such
a
sense
of
anticipation
should
disturb
my
admiration
of
this
woman
and
the
delight
which
i
had
experienced
in
every
accent
of
her
trained
and
exquisite
voice
i
was
standing
very
still
and
in
almost
total
darkness
the
shock
therefore
was
great
when
in
finally
making
up
my
mind
to
move
i
became
conscious
of
a
presence
near
me
totally
indiscernible
and
as
silent
as
myself
whose
no
watchman
or
he
would
have
spoken
at
the
rustle
i
made
stumbling
back
against
the
some
marauder
then
or
a
detective
like
myself
i
would
not
waste
time
in
speculating
better
to
decide
the
question
at
once
for
the
situation
was
eery
the
person
whoever
he
was
stood
so
near
and
so
still
and
so
directly
in
the
way
of
my
advance
drawing
the
lantern
from
my
pocket
i
pushed
open
the
slide
and
flashed
the
light
on
the
immovable
figure
before
me
the
face
i
beheld
staring
into
mine
was
one
quite
unknown
to
me
but
as
i
took
in
its
expression
my
arm
gradually
fell
and
with
it
the
light
from
the
man
features
till
face
and
form
were
lost
again
in
the
darkness
leaving
in
my
disturbed
mind
naught
but
an
impression
but
such
an
impression
the
countenance
thus
flashed
upon
my
vision
must
have
been
a
haunting
one
at
any
time
but
seen
as
i
saw
it
at
a
moment
of
extreme
the
effect
was
startling
yet
i
had
sufficient
control
over
myself
to
utter
a
word
or
two
of
apology
which
was
not
answered
if
it
was
even
heard
a
more
exact
description
may
be
advisable
the
person
whom
i
thus
encountered
hesitating
before
carew
house
was
a
man
of
meager
build
sloping
shoulders
and
handsome
but
painfully
pinched
features
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
culture
and
the
nicest
refinement
was
evident
at
first
glance
that
this
culture
and
refinement
were
at
this
moment
under
the
dominion
of
some
fierce
thought
or
resolve
was
equally
apparent
giving
to
his
look
an
absorption
which
the
shock
attending
the
glare
i
had
thus
suddenly
thrown
on
his
face
could
not
immediately
dispel
dazed
by
an
encounter
for
which
he
seemed
even
less
prepared
than
myself
he
stood
with
his
heart
in
his
face
if
i
may
so
speak
and
only
gradually
came
to
himself
as
the
sense
of
my
proximity
forced
itself
in
upon
his
suffering
and
engrossed
mind
when
i
saw
that
he
had
quite
emerged
from
his
dream
i
dropped
the
light
but
i
did
not
forget
his
look
i
did
not
forget
the
man
though
i
hastened
to
leave
him
in
my
desire
to
fulfill
the
purpose
for
which
i
had
entered
these
grounds
at
so
late
an
hour
my
plan
was
as
i
have
said
to
visit
the
ocumpaugh
stables
and
have
a
chat
with
the
coachman
i
had
no
doubt
of
my
welcome
and
not
much
doubt
of
myself
yet
as
i
left
the
vicinity
of
carew
cottage
and
came
upon
the
great
house
of
the
ocumpaughs
looming
in
the
moonlight
above
its
marble
terraces
i
felt
impressed
as
never
before
both
by
the
beauty
and
magnificence
of
the
noble
pile
and
shrank
with
something
like
shame
from
the
presumption
which
had
led
me
to
pit
my
wits
against
a
mystery
having
its
birth
in
so
much
grandeur
and
material
power
the
prestige
of
great
wealth
as
embodied
in
this
superb
structure
awed
me
from
my
task
and
i
was
passing
the
twin
pergolas
and
walks
with
hesitating
foot
when
i
heard
through
one
of
the
open
windows
a
cry
which
made
me
forget
everything
but
our
common
heritage
of
sorrow
and
the
equal
hold
it
has
on
high
and
low
philo
the
voice
rang
out
in
a
misery
to
wring
the
heart
of
the
most
callous
philo
philo
ocumpaugh
name
called
aloud
by
his
suffering
wife
was
she
in
delirium
it
would
seem
so
but
why
philo
always
philo
and
not
once
gwendolen
with
hushed
steps
ears
ringing
and
heart
palpitating
with
new
and
indefinable
sensations
i
turned
into
the
road
to
the
stables
there
were
men
about
and
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
a
maid
pretty
head
looking
from
one
of
the
rear
windows
but
no
one
stopped
me
and
i
reached
the
stable
just
as
a
man
came
sauntering
out
to
take
his
final
look
at
the
weather
it
was
the
fellow
i
sought
thomas
the
coachman
i
had
not
miscalculated
the
nature
of
my
man
in
ten
minutes
we
were
seated
together
on
an
open
balcony
smoking
and
beguiling
the
time
with
a
little
harmless
gossip
after
a
free
and
easy
discussion
of
the
great
event
mingled
with
the
criticism
of
the
police
we
proceeded
under
my
guidance
to
those
particulars
for
which
i
had
risked
losing
this
very
valuable
hour
he
mentioned
ocumpaugh
i
mentioned
carew
a
beautiful
woman
i
remarked
i
thought
he
looked
astonished
beautiful
was
his
doubtful
rejoinder
what
do
you
think
of
mrs
ocumpaugh
she
is
handsome
too
but
in
a
different
way
i
should
think
so
i
driven
rich
and
i
driven
poor
i
even
sat
on
the
box
in
front
of
an
english
duchess
but
never
have
i
seen
such
features
as
ocumpaugh
that
why
i
consent
to
drive
an
american
millionaire
wife
when
i
might
be
driving
the
english
nobility
a
statue
said
i
cold
true
enough
but
one
you
never
tire
of
looking
at
besides
she
can
light
up
wonderfully
i
seen
her
when
she
was
all
and
lovely
as
the
loveliest
and
when
do
you
think
that
was
when
she
had
her
child
in
her
arms
i
spoke
in
lowered
tones
as
befitted
the
suggestion
and
the
circumstances
no
he
drawled
between
thoughtful
puffs
of
smoke
when
ocumpaugh
sat
on
the
seat
beside
her
this
when
i
was
driving
the
victoria
i
often
used
to
make
excuse
for
turning
my
head
about
so
as
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
smile
at
some
fine
view
and
the
way
she
looked
up
at
him
to
see
if
he
was
enjoying
it
as
much
as
she
i
like
women
who
love
their
husbands
and
he
oh
she
has
nothing
to
complain
of
in
him
he
worships
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
he
more
than
worshiped
the
child
here
voice
fell
i
brought
the
conversation
back
as
quickly
as
i
could
to
carew
you
like
pale
women
said
i
now
i
like
a
woman
who
looks
plain
one
minute
and
perfectly
charming
the
next
that
what
people
say
of
carew
i
know
of
lots
who
admire
that
kind
the
little
girl
for
one
gwendolen
was
she
attracted
to
mrs
carew
attracted
i
seen
her
go
to
her
from
her
mother
lap
like
a
bird
to
its
nest
many
a
time
have
i
driven
the
carriage
with
ocumpaugh
sitting
up
straight
inside
and
her
child
curled
up
in
this
other
woman
arms
with
not
a
look
or
word
for
her
mother
how
did
ocumpaugh
seem
to
like
that
i
asked
between
puffs
of
my
cigar
oh
she
one
of
the
cold
ones
you
know
at
least
you
say
so
but
i
feel
sure
that
for
the
last
three
years
that
is
ever
since
this
woman
came
into
the
neighborhood
her
heart
has
been
slowly
breaking
this
last
blow
will
kill
her
i
thought
of
the
moaning
cry
of
philo
philo
which
at
intervals
i
still
seemed
to
hear
issue
from
that
upper
window
in
the
great
house
and
felt
that
there
might
be
truth
in
his
fears
but
it
was
of
carew
i
had
come
to
talk
and
not
of
ocumpaugh
children
fancies
are
unaccountable
i
sententiously
remarked
but
perhaps
there
is
some
excuse
for
this
one
carew
has
what
you
call
magnetism
a
personality
which
i
should
imagine
would
be
very
appealing
to
a
child
i
never
saw
such
expression
in
a
human
face
whatever
her
mood
she
impresses
each
passing
feeling
upon
you
as
the
one
reality
of
her
life
i
can
not
understand
such
changes
but
they
are
very
fascinating
oh
they
are
easy
enough
to
understand
in
her
case
she
was
an
actress
once
i
myself
have
seen
her
on
the
stage
in
london
i
used
to
admire
her
there
an
actress
i
repeated
somewhat
taken
aback
yes
i
forget
what
name
she
played
under
but
she
a
very
great
lady
now
in
with
all
the
swells
and
rich
enough
to
own
a
yacht
if
she
wanted
to
but
a
widow
oh
yes
a
widow
i
let
a
moment
of
silence
pass
then
nonchalantly
remarked
why
is
she
going
to
europe
but
this
was
too
much
for
my
friend
he
neither
knew
nor
had
any
conjecture
ready
but
i
saw
that
he
did
not
deplore
her
resolve
his
reason
for
this
presently
appeared
if
the
little
one
is
found
the
mother
will
want
all
her
caresses
let
carew
hug
the
boy
that
god
in
his
mercy
has
thrown
into
her
arms
and
leave
other
children
to
their
mothers
i
rose
to
leave
when
i
bethought
me
and
stopped
to
ask
another
question
who
is
the
gentleman
i
have
seen
about
here
a
man
with
a
handsome
face
but
very
pale
and
thin
in
his
appearance
so
much
so
that
it
is
quite
noticeable
do
you
mean
mr
rathbone
i
do
not
know
his
name
a
light
complexioned
man
who
looks
as
if
greatly
afflicted
by
some
disease
or
secret
depression
oh
that
is
rathbone
sure
he
is
enough
and
not
without
his
trouble
too
they
say
but
it
all
gossip
of
course
that
he
has
set
his
heart
on
the
widow
mrs
carew
of
course
who
else
and
she
why
she
would
be
a
fool
to
care
for
him
unless
unless
what
thomas
laughed
a
little
uneasily
i
could
not
help
thinking
i
afraid
we
talking
scandal
said
he
you
know
the
relationship
what
relationship
why
his
relationship
to
the
family
he
is
gwendolen
cousin
and
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
named
after
her
in
madam
ocumpaugh
will
o
i
see
the
next
heir
eh
yes
to
the
rathbone
property
so
that
if
she
is
not
found
your
sickly
man
in
that
case
would
be
well
worth
the
marrying
is
carew
so
fond
of
money
as
all
that
i
thought
she
was
a
woman
of
property
she
is
but
it
takes
money
to
make
some
men
interesting
he
handsome
enough
or
independent
enough
to
go
entirely
on
his
own
merits
besides
he
has
a
troop
of
relatives
hanging
on
to
him
who
more
than
eat
up
his
salary
a
business
man
then
yes
in
some
new
york
house
he
was
always
very
fond
of
gwendolen
and
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
that
he
is
very
much
cut
up
by
our
trouble
i
always
thought
well
of
rathbone
myself
which
same
ended
the
conversation
so
far
as
my
interest
in
it
was
concerned
ix
the
bungalow
as
soon
as
i
could
break
away
and
leave
him
i
did
and
betook
myself
to
carew
house
my
resolve
was
taken
late
as
it
was
i
would
attempt
an
interview
with
her
the
lights
still
burning
above
and
below
gave
me
the
necessary
courage
yet
i
was
conscious
of
some
embarrassment
in
presenting
my
name
to
the
astonished
maid
who
was
in
the
act
of
extinguishing
the
when
my
vigorous
ring
prevented
her
seeing
her
doubtful
look
and
the
hesitation
with
which
she
held
the
door
i
told
her
that
i
would
wait
outside
on
the
porch
till
she
had
carried
up
my
name
to
carew
this
seemed
to
relieve
her
and
in
a
moment
i
was
standing
again
under
the
vines
waiting
for
permission
to
enter
the
house
it
came
very
soon
and
i
had
to
conquer
a
fresh
embarrassment
at
the
sight
of
carew
nimble
and
gracious
figure
descending
the
stairs
in
all
eagerness
to
greet
me
what
is
it
she
asked
running
hastily
forward
so
that
we
met
in
the
center
of
the
hall
good
news
nothing
else
could
have
brought
you
back
again
so
soon
and
at
an
hour
so
late
there
was
a
dangerous
naïveté
in
the
way
she
uttered
the
last
three
words
which
made
me
suspect
the
actress
indeed
i
was
quite
conscious
as
i
met
her
thrilling
and
expressive
glance
that
i
should
never
feel
again
the
same
confidence
in
her
sincerity
my
judgment
had
been
confounded
and
my
insight
rendered
helpless
by
what
i
had
heard
of
her
art
and
the
fact
that
she
had
once
been
a
capable
player
of
parts
but
i
was
man
enough
and
detective
enough
not
to
betray
my
suspicion
now
that
i
was
brought
face
to
face
with
her
it
had
always
been
latent
in
my
breast
even
in
the
very
midst
of
my
greatest
admiration
for
her
yet
i
had
never
acknowledged
to
myself
of
what
i
suspected
her
nor
did
i
now
not
quite
not
enough
to
give
that
point
to
my
attack
which
would
have
insured
me
immediate
victory
or
defeat
i
was
obliged
to
feel
my
way
and
so
answered
with
every
appearance
of
friendly
confidence
i
fear
then
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
ask
your
pardon
i
have
no
good
news
rather
what
might
be
called
if
not
bad
of
a
very
perplexing
character
the
child
has
been
traced
here
i
purposely
let
my
voice
halt
for
an
instant
here
here
her
eyes
opened
her
lips
parted
in
a
look
of
surprise
so
ingenuous
that
involuntarily
i
felt
forced
to
add
by
way
of
explanation
the
child
i
mean
who
was
carried
screaming
along
the
highway
in
a
wagon
and
for
whom
the
police
and
others
have
for
two
days
been
looking
oh
she
ejaculated
with
a
slight
turn
of
her
head
aside
as
she
motioned
me
toward
a
chair
and
is
that
child
gwendolen
or
do
you
know
she
was
all
eagerness
as
she
again
faced
me
that
will
be
known
i
rejoined
resisting
the
beautiful
brightness
of
her
face
with
an
effort
that
must
have
left
its
mark
on
my
own
features
for
she
smiled
with
unconscious
triumph
as
she
held
my
eyes
for
a
minute
in
hers
saying
softly
o
how
you
excite
me
tell
me
more
where
was
the
wagon
found
who
is
with
it
and
how
much
of
all
this
have
you
told
mrs
ocumpaugh
with
the
last
question
she
had
risen
involuntarily
it
seemed
and
as
though
she
would
rush
to
her
friend
if
i
did
not
at
once
reassure
her
of
that
friend
knowledge
of
a
fact
which
seemed
to
throw
a
gleam
of
hope
upon
a
situation
hitherto
entirely
unrelieved
ocumpaugh
has
been
told
nothing
i
hastily
returned
answering
the
last
and
most
important
question
first
nor
must
she
be
at
least
not
till
certainty
replaces
doubt
she
is
in
a
critical
state
i
am
told
to
rouse
her
hopes
only
to
dash
them
again
would
be
cruel
policy
with
her
eyes
still
on
my
face
carew
slowly
reseated
herself
then
there
are
doubts
she
faltered
doubts
of
its
being
gwendolen
there
is
always
doubt
i
replied
and
openly
paused
in
manifest
oh
she
somewhat
wildly
exclaimed
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
beautiful
hands
covered
with
jewels
what
suspense
what
bitter
and
cruel
suspense
i
feel
it
almost
as
much
as
if
it
were
my
harry
was
the
final
cry
with
which
she
dropped
them
again
and
she
did
feel
it
her
features
had
blanched
and
her
form
was
shaking
but
you
have
not
answered
my
questions
as
to
where
this
wagon
is
at
present
and
under
whose
care
ca
you
see
how
anxious
i
must
be
about
that
if
it
should
prove
to
be
gwendolen
carew
if
i
could
tell
you
that
i
could
tell
you
more
we
shall
both
have
to
wait
till
meanwhile
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
have
you
by
any
chance
the
means
of
entrance
to
the
bungalow
i
have
a
great
and
inappeasable
desire
to
see
for
myself
if
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
that
place
have
given
up
their
secrets
it
an
egotistical
desire
no
doubt
and
may
strike
you
as
folly
of
the
rankest
but
we
detectives
have
learned
to
trust
nobody
in
our
investigations
and
i
shall
never
be
satisfied
till
i
have
looked
this
whole
spot
over
inch
by
inch
for
the
clue
which
may
yet
remain
there
if
there
is
a
clue
i
must
find
it
clue
she
was
looking
at
me
a
little
breathlessly
clue
to
what
then
she
was
in
the
wagon
you
are
still
seeking
her
always
seeking
her
i
put
in
but
surely
not
in
the
bungalow
carew
expression
was
one
of
extreme
surprise
what
can
you
find
there
i
do
not
know
but
i
want
to
look
i
can
go
to
the
house
for
a
key
but
it
is
late
and
it
seems
unpardonable
to
disturb
ocumpaugh
yet
i
shall
have
to
do
this
if
you
have
not
a
key
for
i
shall
not
sleep
till
i
have
satisfied
myself
that
nothing
can
be
discovered
on
the
immediate
scene
of
gwendolen
disappearance
to
help
forward
the
rescue
we
both
are
so
intent
upon
you
are
right
was
the
hesitating
reply
i
received
i
have
a
key
i
will
fetch
it
and
if
you
do
not
mind
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
bungalow
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
i
replied
with
my
best
bow
white
lies
come
easy
in
our
trade
i
will
not
keep
you
a
minute
she
said
rising
and
going
into
the
hall
but
in
an
instant
she
was
back
a
word
to
my
maid
and
a
covering
for
my
head
she
explained
and
i
will
be
with
you
her
manner
pointed
unmistakably
to
the
door
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
step
out
on
the
porch
to
await
her
but
she
was
true
to
her
word
and
in
a
moment
she
had
joined
me
with
the
key
in
her
hand
oh
what
adventures
was
her
breathless
cry
shall
i
ever
forget
this
dreadful
this
interminable
week
but
it
is
dark
even
the
moon
is
clouded
over
how
shall
we
see
there
are
no
lights
in
the
bungalow
i
have
a
lantern
in
my
pocket
my
only
hope
is
that
no
stray
gleam
from
it
may
pierce
the
shrubbery
and
bring
the
police
upon
us
do
you
fear
the
police
she
chatted
away
almost
as
a
child
might
no
but
i
want
to
do
my
work
alone
there
will
be
little
glory
or
little
money
in
it
if
they
share
any
of
my
discoveries
ah
it
was
an
irrepressible
exclamation
or
so
it
seemed
but
i
should
not
have
noted
it
if
i
had
not
caught
or
persuaded
myself
that
i
had
caught
the
oblique
glint
from
her
eye
which
accompanied
it
but
it
was
very
dark
just
at
this
time
and
i
could
be
sure
of
nothing
but
that
she
kept
close
to
my
side
and
seemed
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
addressing
me
in
the
short
distance
we
traversed
before
reaching
the
bungalow
but
nothing
save
inarticulate
murmurs
left
her
lips
and
soon
we
were
too
busy
in
our
endeavors
to
unlock
the
door
to
think
of
conversation
the
key
she
had
brought
was
rusty
evidently
she
had
not
often
made
use
of
it
but
after
a
few
futile
efforts
i
succeeded
in
making
it
work
and
we
stepped
into
the
small
building
in
a
silence
that
was
only
less
profound
than
the
darkness
in
which
we
instantly
found
ourselves
enveloped
light
was
under
my
hand
however
and
in
another
moment
there
opened
before
us
the
small
square
room
whose
every
feature
had
taken
on
a
ghostly
and
unfamiliar
air
from
the
strange
hour
and
the
unwonted
circumstances
i
saw
how
her
impressionable
nature
was
affected
by
the
scene
and
made
haste
to
assume
the
offhand
air
i
thought
most
likely
to
overcome
her
apprehension
but
the
effect
of
the
blank
walls
before
her
relieved
but
in
no
reassuring
way
by
the
long
dark
folds
of
the
rugs
hanging
straight
down
over
the
mysterious
partition
held
its
own
against
my
efforts
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
her
voice
falter
as
she
asked
what
i
expected
to
find
there
i
pointed
to
a
chair
and
said
if
you
will
sit
down
i
will
show
you
not
what
i
expect
to
find
but
how
a
detective
goes
about
his
work
whatever
our
expectations
however
small
or
however
great
we
pay
full
attention
to
details
now
the
detail
which
has
worried
me
in
regard
to
this
place
is
the
existence
of
a
certain
space
in
this
building
unaccounted
for
by
these
four
walls
in
other
words
the
portion
which
lies
behind
these
rugs
and
throwing
aside
the
same
i
let
the
flame
from
my
lantern
play
over
the
space
which
i
had
before
examined
with
little
satisfaction
this
partition
i
continued
seems
as
firm
as
any
of
the
walls
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
it
hides
nothing
if
the
child
should
be
in
some
hole
back
of
this
partition
what
a
horror
and
what
an
outrage
but
it
is
impossible
came
almost
in
a
shriek
from
the
woman
behind
me
the
opening
is
completely
walled
up
i
have
never
known
of
its
being
otherwise
it
looked
like
that
when
i
came
here
three
years
ago
there
is
no
possible
passage
through
that
wall
why
was
it
ever
closed
up
do
you
know
not
exactly
the
family
are
very
reticent
about
it
some
fancy
of
ocumpaugh
father
i
believe
he
was
an
odd
man
they
tell
all
manner
of
stories
about
him
if
anything
offended
him
he
rid
himself
of
it
immediately
he
took
a
distaste
to
that
end
of
the
hut
as
they
used
to
call
it
in
the
old
days
before
it
was
remodeled
to
suit
the
house
so
he
had
it
walled
up
that
is
all
we
know
about
it
i
wish
i
could
see
behind
that
wall
i
muttered
dropping
back
the
rug
i
had
all
this
time
held
in
my
hand
i
feel
some
mystery
here
which
i
can
not
grasp
then
as
i
flashed
my
lantern
about
in
every
direction
with
no
visible
result
added
with
the
effort
which
accompanies
such
disappointments
there
is
nothing
here
carew
though
it
is
the
scene
of
the
child
disappearance
it
gives
me
nothing
x
temptation
the
sharp
rustle
of
her
dress
as
she
suddenly
rose
struck
upon
my
ear
then
let
us
go
she
cried
with
just
a
slight
quiver
of
eagerness
in
her
wonderful
voice
i
comprehended
its
culture
now
the
place
is
ghostly
at
this
hour
of
the
night
i
believe
that
i
am
really
afraid
with
a
muttered
reassurance
i
allowed
the
full
light
of
the
lantern
to
fall
directly
on
her
face
she
afraid
there
was
no
other
explanation
possible
for
her
wild
staring
eyes
and
blue
quivering
lips
for
the
instant
i
hardly
knew
her
then
her
glance
rose
to
mine
and
she
smiled
and
it
was
with
difficulty
i
refrained
from
acknowledging
in
words
my
appreciation
of
her
wonderful
flexibility
of
expression
you
are
astonished
to
see
me
so
affected
she
said
it
is
not
so
strange
as
you
think
it
is
superstition
the
horror
of
what
once
happened
here
the
reason
for
that
partition
i
know
the
whole
story
for
all
my
attempts
to
deny
it
just
now
the
hour
too
is
unfortunate
the
darkness
your
shifting
mysterious
light
it
was
late
like
this
and
dark
with
just
the
moon
to
illumine
the
scene
when
she
trevitt
do
you
want
to
know
the
story
of
this
place
the
old
much
story
which
led
first
to
its
complete
abandonment
then
to
the
building
of
that
dividing
wall
and
finally
to
the
restoration
of
this
portion
and
of
this
alone
do
you
her
eagerness
in
such
startling
contrast
to
the
reticence
she
had
shown
on
this
very
subject
a
few
minutes
before
affected
me
peculiarly
i
wanted
to
hear
the
story
any
one
would
who
had
listened
to
the
gossip
of
this
neighborhood
for
years
but
she
evidently
did
not
mean
to
give
me
time
to
understand
my
own
hesitation
i
have
the
whole
history
the
touching
history
up
at
my
house
at
this
very
moment
it
was
written
by
no
i
will
let
you
guess
the
naïveté
of
her
smile
made
me
forget
the
force
of
its
late
expression
mr
ocumpaugh
i
ventured
which
ocumpaugh
there
have
been
so
many
she
began
slowly
naturally
to
move
toward
the
door
i
can
not
guess
then
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
it
was
written
by
the
one
who
come
i
will
tell
you
outside
i
have
any
courage
here
but
i
have
you
have
read
the
story
never
mind
tell
me
who
the
writer
was
ocumpaugh
father
he
by
whose
orders
this
partition
was
put
up
oh
you
have
story
written
and
by
himself
you
are
fortunate
mrs
carew
i
had
turned
the
lantern
from
her
face
but
not
so
far
that
i
did
not
detect
the
deep
flush
which
dyed
her
whole
countenance
at
these
words
i
am
she
emphatically
returned
meeting
my
eyes
with
a
steady
look
i
was
not
sufficiently
expert
with
women
ways
or
at
all
events
with
this
woman
ways
to
understand
seldom
has
such
a
tale
been
written
seldom
let
us
thank
god
has
there
been
an
equal
occasion
for
it
you
interest
me
i
said
and
she
did
little
as
this
history
might
have
to
do
with
the
finding
of
gwendolen
i
felt
an
almost
imperative
necessity
of
satisfying
my
curiosity
in
regard
to
it
though
i
knew
she
had
deliberately
roused
this
curiosity
for
a
purpose
which
if
not
comprehensible
to
me
was
of
marked
importance
to
her
and
not
altogether
for
the
reason
she
had
been
pleased
to
give
me
possibly
it
was
on
account
of
this
last
mentioned
conviction
that
i
allowed
myself
to
be
so
interested
it
is
late
she
murmured
with
a
final
glance
towards
those
dismal
hangings
which
in
my
present
mood
i
should
not
have
been
so
greatly
surprised
to
see
stir
under
her
look
however
if
you
will
pardon
the
hour
and
accept
a
seat
in
my
small
library
i
will
show
you
what
only
one
other
person
has
seen
besides
myself
it
was
a
temptation
for
several
reasons
it
was
a
temptation
yet
i
want
you
to
see
why
i
am
frightened
of
this
place
she
said
flashing
her
eyes
upon
me
with
an
almost
girlish
appeal
i
will
go
said
i
and
following
her
quickly
out
i
locked
the
bungalow
door
and
ignoring
the
hand
she
extended
toward
me
dropped
the
key
into
my
pocket
i
thought
i
heard
a
little
gasp
the
least
the
smallest
of
sounds
possible
but
if
so
the
feeling
which
prompted
it
was
not
apparent
in
her
manner
or
her
voice
as
she
led
the
way
back
to
her
house
and
ushered
me
into
a
hall
full
of
and
the
general
litter
accompanying
an
approaching
departure
you
will
excuse
the
disorder
she
cried
as
she
piloted
me
through
these
various
encumbrances
to
a
small
but
exquisitely
furnished
room
still
glorying
in
its
full
complement
of
ornaments
and
pictures
this
trouble
which
has
come
to
one
i
love
has
made
it
very
hard
for
me
to
do
anything
i
feel
helpless
at
times
completely
helpless
the
dejection
she
expressed
was
but
momentary
however
in
another
instant
she
was
pointing
out
a
chair
and
begging
me
to
make
myself
comfortable
while
she
went
for
the
letter
i
think
she
called
it
a
letter
which
i
had
come
there
to
read
what
was
i
to
think
of
her
what
was
i
to
think
of
myself
and
what
would
the
story
tell
me
to
warrant
the
loss
of
what
might
have
proved
a
most
valuable
hour
i
had
not
answered
these
questions
when
she
reëntered
with
a
bundle
in
her
hand
of
discolored
i
should
almost
call
them
mouldered
sheets
of
much
crumpled
paper
these
she
began
then
seeing
me
look
at
them
with
something
like
suspicion
she
paused
until
she
caught
my
eye
when
she
added
gravely
these
came
to
me
from
ocumpaugh
how
she
got
them
you
will
have
to
ask
her
i
should
say
judging
from
appearances
here
she
took
a
seat
opposite
me
at
a
small
table
near
which
i
had
been
placed
that
they
must
have
been
found
in
some
old
chest
or
possibly
in
some
hidden
drawer
of
one
of
those
curious
antique
desks
of
which
more
than
one
was
discovered
in
the
garrets
of
the
old
house
when
it
was
pulled
down
to
give
place
to
the
new
one
is
this
letter
as
you
call
it
so
old
i
asked
it
is
dated
years
ago
the
garret
must
have
been
a
damp
one
i
remarked
she
flashed
me
a
look
i
thought
of
it
more
than
once
afterward
and
asked
if
she
should
do
the
reading
or
i
you
i
rejoined
all
afire
with
the
prospect
of
listening
to
her
remarkable
voice
in
what
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
would
call
forth
its
full
expression
only
let
me
look
at
those
sheets
first
and
understand
as
perfectly
as
i
may
just
what
it
is
you
are
going
to
read
to
me
it
an
explanation
written
for
his
heirs
by
ocumpaugh
the
story
itself
she
went
on
handing
me
over
the
papers
she
held
begins
abruptly
from
the
way
the
sheet
is
torn
across
at
the
top
i
judge
that
the
narrative
itself
was
preceded
by
some
introductory
words
now
lacking
when
i
have
read
it
to
you
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
those
introductory
words
were
i
handed
back
the
sheets
there
seemed
to
be
a
spell
in
the
air
possibly
it
arose
from
her
manner
which
was
one
to
rouse
expectation
even
in
one
whose
imagination
had
not
already
been
stirred
by
a
visit
at
night
and
in
more
than
commonly
bewildering
company
to
the
place
whose
dark
and
hitherto
unknown
secret
i
was
about
to
hear
i
am
ready
i
said
feeling
my
strange
position
but
not
anxious
to
change
it
just
then
for
any
other
conceivable
one
she
drew
a
deep
breath
again
fixed
me
with
her
strange
compelling
eyes
and
with
the
final
remark
the
present
no
longer
exists
we
are
back
in
the
seventies
began
this
enthralling
tale
i
did
not
move
till
the
last
line
dropped
from
her
lips
xi
the
secret
of
the
old
pavilion
i
was
as
sane
that
night
as
i
had
ever
been
in
my
life
i
am
quite
sure
of
this
though
i
had
had
a
merry
time
enough
earlier
in
the
evening
with
my
friends
in
the
old
pavilion
that
retreat
of
my
ancestors
whose
desolation
i
had
thought
to
dissipate
with
a
little
harmless
revelry
wine
does
not
disturb
my
reason
the
little
wine
i
drank
under
that
unwholesome
roof
nor
am
i
a
man
given
to
sudden
excitements
or
untoward
impulses
yet
this
thing
happened
to
me
it
was
after
leaving
the
pavilion
my
companions
had
all
ridden
away
and
i
was
standing
on
the
lawn
beyond
my
library
windows
recalling
my
pleasure
with
them
and
gazing
somewhat
idly
i
own
at
that
bare
portion
of
the
old
wall
where
the
tree
fell
a
year
ago
the
place
where
the
moon
strikes
with
such
a
glitter
when
it
rides
high
as
it
did
that
night
when
believe
it
or
not
it
is
all
one
to
me
i
became
conscious
of
a
sudden
mental
dread
inexplicable
and
alarming
which
seizing
me
after
an
hour
of
unmixed
pleasure
and
gaiety
took
such
a
firm
grip
upon
my
imagination
that
i
fain
would
have
turned
my
back
upon
the
night
and
its
influences
only
my
eyes
would
not
leave
that
open
space
of
wall
where
i
now
saw
pass
not
the
shadow
but
the
veritable
body
of
a
large
black
dog
which
while
i
looked
turned
into
the
open
gateway
connecting
with
the
pavilion
and
disappeared
with
it
went
the
oppression
which
held
me
the
ice
melted
from
my
blood
i
could
move
my
limbs
and
again
control
my
thoughts
and
exercise
my
will
forcing
a
laugh
i
whistled
to
that
dog
the
lights
with
which
the
banquet
had
been
illuminated
were
out
and
every
servant
had
left
the
place
but
the
tables
had
not
been
entirely
cleared
and
i
could
well
understand
what
had
drawn
this
strange
animal
thither
i
whistled
then
and
whistled
peremptorily
but
no
dog
answered
my
call
angry
for
the
rules
are
strict
at
my
stables
in
regard
to
wandering
brutes
i
strode
toward
the
pavilion
entering
the
great
gap
in
the
wall
where
a
gate
had
once
hung
i
surveyed
the
dismal
interior
before
me
with
feelings
i
could
not
but
consider
odd
in
a
strong
man
like
myself
though
the
wine
was
scarcely
dry
in
the
glass
which
an
hour
before
i
had
raised
in
this
very
spot
amid
cheers
and
laughter
i
found
it
a
difficult
matter
to
reënter
there
now
in
the
dead
of
night
alone
and
without
light
for
this
building
harmless
as
it
had
always
seemed
had
been
in
a
way
cursed
for
no
reason
that
he
ever
gave
my
father
had
doomed
this
ancient
adjunct
to
our
home
to
perpetual
solitude
and
decay
by
his
will
he
had
forbidden
it
to
be
destroyed
a
wish
respected
by
my
guardians
and
afterward
by
myself
and
though
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
its
being
cared
for
and
in
a
manner
used
the
dismal
influence
which
had
pervaded
the
place
ever
since
his
death
had
under
the
sensations
i
have
mentioned
deepened
into
horror
and
an
unspeakable
repugnance
yet
never
having
had
any
reason
to
believe
myself
a
coward
i
took
boldly
enough
the
few
steps
necessary
to
carry
me
inside
its
dismal
precincts
and
meeting
with
nothing
but
darkness
and
silence
began
to
whistle
again
for
the
dog
i
had
certainly
seen
enter
here
but
no
dog
appeared
hastening
out
i
took
my
way
toward
the
stables
as
i
did
so
i
glanced
back
and
again
my
eyes
fell
on
that
place
in
the
wall
gleaming
white
in
the
moonlight
again
i
felt
the
chill
the
horror
again
my
eyes
remained
glued
to
this
one
spot
and
again
i
beheld
the
passing
of
that
dog
running
with
jaws
extended
and
head
held
low
fearsome
uncanny
supernaturally
horrible
a
thing
to
flee
from
if
one
could
only
flee
instead
of
standing
on
the
sward
gazing
with
eyes
that
seemed
starting
from
their
sockets
till
it
had
plunged
through
that
gap
in
the
wall
and
again
disappeared
the
occult
and
the
imaginary
have
never
appealed
to
me
and
the
moment
i
felt
myself
a
man
again
i
hurried
on
to
the
stables
to
call
up
my
man
jared
but
there
i
paused
struck
by
an
odd
remembrance
this
father
of
mine
philo
ocumpaugh
had
died
or
so
his
old
servants
had
said
under
peculiar
circumstances
i
had
forgotten
them
till
now
such
stories
make
poor
headway
with
me
but
if
i
was
not
mistaken
the
facts
were
these
he
had
been
ailing
long
and
his
nurses
had
got
used
to
the
sight
of
his
gaunt
white
figure
sitting
propped
up
but
speechless
in
the
great
bed
opposite
the
stretch
of
blank
wall
in
the
corner
bedroom
where
a
picture
of
his
first
wife
the
wife
of
his
youth
had
once
hung
but
which
for
some
years
now
had
been
removed
to
where
there
were
fewer
shadows
and
more
sunlight
he
had
never
been
a
talkative
man
and
in
all
the
five
years
of
my
own
memory
of
him
i
had
never
heard
him
raise
his
voice
except
in
command
or
when
the
duties
of
hospitality
required
it
now
with
the
shadow
of
death
upon
him
he
was
absolutely
speechless
and
his
nurses
were
obliged
to
guess
at
his
wishes
by
the
movement
of
his
hands
or
the
direction
of
his
eyes
yet
he
was
not
morose
and
sometimes
was
seen
to
struggle
with
the
guards
holding
his
tongue
as
though
he
would
fain
have
loosed
himself
from
their
inexorable
control
yet
he
never
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
the
nurses
sat
by
and
saw
no
difference
in
him
till
suddenly
the
candle
posed
on
a
table
near
by
flickered
and
went
out
leaving
only
moonlight
in
the
room
it
was
moonlight
so
brilliant
that
the
place
seemed
brighter
than
before
though
the
beams
were
all
concentrated
on
one
spot
a
blank
space
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
upon
which
those
two
dim
orbs
in
the
bed
were
fixed
in
an
expectancy
none
there
understood
for
none
knew
that
the
summons
had
come
and
that
for
him
the
angel
of
death
was
at
that
moment
standing
in
the
room
yet
as
moonlight
is
not
the
natural
light
for
a
sick
man
bedside
one
amongst
them
had
risen
for
another
candle
when
something
i
had
never
stopped
to
hear
them
say
what
made
him
pause
and
look
back
when
he
saw
distinctly
outlined
upon
the
white
i
have
mentioned
the
figure
the
unimaginable
figure
of
a
dog
large
fierce
and
which
dashed
by
and
was
gone
simultaneously
a
cry
came
from
the
bed
the
first
words
for
months
aline
the
name
of
his
dead
and
gone
for
years
all
sprang
some
to
chase
the
dog
one
to
aid
and
comfort
the
sick
man
but
no
dog
was
there
nor
did
he
need
comfort
more
he
had
died
with
that
cry
on
his
lips
and
as
they
gazed
at
his
face
sunk
low
now
in
his
pillow
as
if
he
had
started
up
and
fallen
back
a
dead
weight
they
felt
the
terror
of
the
moment
grow
upon
them
till
they
too
were
speechless
for
the
aged
features
were
drawn
into
lines
of
unspeakable
anguish
and
horror
but
as
the
night
passed
and
morning
came
all
these
lines
smoothed
out
and
when
they
buried
him
those
who
had
known
him
well
talked
of
the
beautiful
serenity
which
illumined
the
face
which
since
their
first
remembrance
of
him
had
carried
the
secret
of
a
profound
and
unbroken
melancholy
of
the
dog
nothing
was
said
even
in
whispers
till
time
had
hallowed
that
grave
and
the
little
children
about
grown
to
be
men
and
women
then
the
garrulity
of
age
had
its
way
this
story
and
the
images
it
called
up
came
like
a
shock
as
i
halted
there
and
instead
of
going
on
to
the
stables
i
turned
my
steps
toward
the
house
where
i
summoned
from
his
bed
a
certain
old
servant
who
had
lived
longer
in
the
family
than
myself
bidding
him
bring
a
lantern
i
waited
for
him
on
the
porch
and
when
he
came
i
told
him
what
i
had
seen
instantly
i
knew
that
it
was
no
new
story
to
him
he
turned
very
pale
and
set
down
the
lantern
which
was
shaking
very
visibly
in
his
hand
did
you
look
up
he
asked
when
you
were
in
the
pavilion
i
mean
no
why
should
i
the
dog
was
on
the
ground
besides
let
us
go
down
to
the
pavilion
he
whispered
i
want
to
see
for
myself
if
if
if
what
jared
he
turned
his
eyes
on
me
but
did
not
answer
stooping
i
lifted
the
lantern
and
put
it
in
his
hand
he
was
quaking
like
a
leaf
but
there
was
a
determination
in
his
face
far
beyond
the
ordinary
what
made
him
quake
he
who
knew
of
this
dog
only
by
hearsay
and
what
in
spite
of
this
fear
gave
him
such
resolution
i
followed
in
his
wake
to
see
what
it
was
the
moon
still
shone
clear
upon
the
lawn
and
it
was
with
a
certain
renewal
of
my
former
apprehensions
that
i
approached
the
spot
on
the
wall
where
i
had
seen
what
i
was
satisfied
not
to
see
again
but
though
i
glanced
that
way
what
man
could
have
avoided
it
i
perceived
nothing
but
the
bare
paint
and
we
went
on
and
passed
in
without
a
word
jared
leading
the
way
but
once
on
the
threshold
of
the
pavilion
itself
it
was
for
him
to
show
the
coward
turning
he
made
me
a
gesture
one
i
did
not
understand
and
seeing
that
i
did
not
understand
it
he
said
after
a
fearful
look
around
do
not
mind
the
dog
that
was
but
an
appearance
lift
your
eyes
to
the
ceiling
over
there
at
the
extreme
end
toward
the
south
do
you
see
do
you
see
nothing
i
replied
amazed
at
what
struck
me
as
utter
folly
nothing
he
repeated
in
a
relieved
voice
as
he
lifted
up
his
lantern
ah
came
in
a
sort
of
muttered
shriek
from
his
lips
as
he
pointed
up
here
and
there
along
the
farther
ceiling
over
which
the
light
now
played
freely
and
fully
what
is
that
spot
and
that
spot
and
that
they
were
not
there
i
was
in
here
before
the
banquet
and
would
have
seen
what
is
it
master
what
is
it
they
call
it
well
well
what
do
they
call
it
i
asked
impatiently
blood
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
blood
what
else
is
red
and
shiny
and
shows
in
such
great
drops
nonsense
i
vociferated
taking
the
lantern
in
my
own
hand
blood
on
the
ceiling
of
my
old
pavilion
where
could
it
come
from
there
was
no
quarrel
no
fight
only
hilarity
where
did
the
dog
come
from
he
whispered
i
dropped
my
arm
staring
at
him
in
mingled
anger
and
a
certain
sympathy
you
think
these
stains
i
began
are
as
unreal
as
the
dog
yes
master
feeling
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
i
tossed
up
the
lantern
again
the
drops
were
still
there
but
no
longer
single
or
scattered
from
side
to
side
the
ceiling
at
this
one
end
of
the
building
oozed
with
the
thick
red
moisture
to
which
he
had
given
so
dreadful
a
name
stepping
back
for
fear
the
stains
would
resolve
themselves
into
rain
and
drop
upon
my
forehead
i
stared
at
jared
who
had
now
retreated
toward
the
door
what
makes
you
think
it
blood
i
demanded
because
some
have
smelt
and
tasted
it
we
have
never
talked
about
it
but
this
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
all
these
stains
will
be
gone
they
come
when
the
dog
circles
the
wall
whence
no
one
knows
it
is
our
mystery
all
the
old
servants
have
heard
of
it
more
than
once
the
new
ones
have
never
been
told
nor
would
i
have
told
you
if
you
had
not
seen
the
dog
it
was
a
matter
of
honor
with
us
i
looked
at
him
saw
that
he
believed
every
word
he
said
threw
another
glance
at
the
ceiling
and
led
the
way
out
when
we
had
reached
the
house
again
i
said
you
are
acquainted
with
the
tradition
underlying
these
appearances
as
you
call
them
what
is
it
he
could
not
tell
me
he
knew
no
more
than
he
had
already
stated
gossip
and
old
wives
tales
but
later
a
certain
manuscript
came
into
my
possession
through
my
lawyer
which
i
will
append
to
this
it
was
written
by
my
unhappy
father
some
little
time
before
his
last
illness
and
given
into
the
charge
of
the
legal
representative
of
our
family
with
the
express
injunction
that
its
seal
was
to
remain
intact
if
for
twenty
years
the
apparition
which
had
haunted
him
did
not
present
itself
to
the
eyes
of
any
of
his
children
but
if
within
that
time
his
experience
should
repeat
itself
in
theirs
this
document
was
to
be
handed
over
to
the
occupant
of
homewood
nineteen
out
of
the
twenty
years
had
elapsed
without
the
dog
being
seen
or
the
ceiling
of
the
pavilion
dropping
blood
but
not
the
twentieth
hence
the
document
was
mine
you
can
easily
conceive
with
what
feelings
i
opened
it
it
was
headed
with
this
simple
line
my
story
which
i
can
write
but
could
never
tell
i
am
cursed
with
an
inability
to
speak
when
i
am
most
deeply
moved
either
by
anger
or
tenderness
this
misfortune
has
wrecked
my
life
on
the
verge
of
old
age
the
sorrows
and
the
mistakes
of
my
early
life
fill
my
thoughts
so
completely
that
i
see
but
one
face
hear
but
one
voice
yet
when
she
was
living
when
could
see
and
hear
my
tongue
was
silent
and
she
never
knew
aline
my
aline
i
married
her
when
i
was
and
she
eighteen
all
the
world
knows
this
but
what
it
does
not
know
is
that
i
loved
her
toy
plaything
that
she
was
a
body
without
a
mind
or
so
i
considered
her
while
she
had
but
followed
the
wishes
of
her
relatives
in
giving
her
sweet
youth
to
a
cold
and
reticent
man
who
might
love
indeed
but
who
had
no
power
to
tell
that
love
or
even
to
show
it
in
the
ways
which
women
like
and
which
she
liked
as
i
found
out
when
it
was
too
late
i
could
not
help
but
love
her
it
was
ingrained
within
me
a
part
of
the
curse
of
my
life
to
love
this
gentle
thoughtless
alluring
thing
to
which
i
had
given
my
name
she
had
a
smile
it
did
not
come
often
which
tore
at
my
as
it
welled
up
just
stirring
the
dimples
in
her
cheeks
and
died
away
again
in
a
strange
and
moving
sweetness
though
i
reckoned
her
at
her
worth
knew
that
her
charm
was
all
physical
that
she
neither
did
nor
could
understand
a
passion
like
mine
much
less
return
it
it
was
none
the
less
irresistible
and
i
have
known
myself
to
stand
before
a
certain
in
the
turn
of
the
stairway
for
many
minutes
together
because
i
knew
that
she
would
soon
be
coming
down
and
that
when
she
did
some
ribbon
from
her
gown
would
flutter
by
me
and
i
should
feel
the
soft
contact
and
go
away
happy
to
my
books
yet
if
she
stopped
to
look
back
at
me
i
could
only
return
her
look
with
one
she
doubtless
called
harsh
for
she
had
not
eyes
to
see
below
the
surface
i
tell
you
all
this
lest
you
may
not
understand
she
was
not
your
mother
and
you
may
begrudge
me
the
affection
i
felt
for
her
if
so
thrust
these
leaves
into
the
fire
and
seek
not
the
explanation
of
what
has
surprised
you
for
there
is
no
word
written
here
which
does
not
find
its
meaning
in
the
intense
love
i
bore
for
her
my
young
and
the
tragedy
which
this
love
has
brought
into
my
life
she
was
slight
in
body
slight
in
mind
and
of
slight
feeling
i
first
discovered
this
last
on
the
day
i
put
my
ring
on
her
finger
she
laughed
as
i
fitted
it
close
and
kissed
the
little
hand
not
from
embarrassment
or
childish
impulse
i
could
have
understood
that
but
indifferently
like
one
who
did
not
know
and
never
could
yet
i
married
her
and
for
six
months
lived
in
a
fool
paradise
then
came
that
ball
it
was
held
near
here
very
near
at
one
of
our
neighbor
in
fact
i
remember
that
we
walked
and
that
coming
to
the
driveway
i
lifted
her
and
carried
her
across
not
with
a
smile
do
not
think
it
more
likely
with
a
frown
though
my
heart
was
warm
and
happy
for
when
i
set
her
down
she
shook
herself
and
i
thought
she
did
it
to
hide
a
shudder
and
then
i
could
not
have
spoken
a
word
had
my
life
depended
on
it
i
little
knew
what
lay
back
of
that
shudder
even
after
i
had
seen
her
dance
with
him
not
only
once
but
twice
i
never
dreamed
that
her
thoughts
light
though
they
were
were
not
all
with
me
it
took
that
morsel
of
paper
and
the
plain
words
it
contained
to
satisfy
me
of
this
and
then
but
passion
is
making
me
incoherent
what
do
you
know
of
that
scrap
of
paper
hidden
from
the
whole
world
from
the
moment
i
first
read
it
till
this
hour
of
full
confession
it
fluttered
from
some
one
hand
during
the
dance
i
did
not
see
whose
i
only
saw
it
after
it
had
fallen
at
my
feet
and
as
it
lay
there
open
i
naturally
read
the
words
they
were
written
by
a
man
to
a
woman
urging
flight
and
setting
the
hour
and
place
for
meeting
i
was
conscious
of
shame
in
reading
it
and
let
these
last
details
escape
me
as
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
i
remember
thinking
some
poor
devil
made
miserable
for
there
had
been
hint
in
it
of
the
husband
but
i
had
no
thought
i
swear
it
before
god
of
who
that
husband
was
till
i
beheld
her
flit
back
through
the
open
doorway
with
terror
in
her
mien
and
searching
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
then
hell
opened
before
me
and
i
saw
my
happiness
go
down
into
gulfs
i
had
never
before
sounded
even
in
imagination
but
even
at
that
evil
hour
my
countenance
scarcely
changed
i
was
opposite
a
mirror
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
myself
as
i
moved
but
there
must
have
been
some
change
in
my
voice
for
when
i
addressed
her
she
started
and
turned
her
face
upon
me
with
a
wild
and
pathetic
look
which
knocked
so
at
my
heart
that
i
wished
i
had
never
read
those
words
and
so
could
return
her
the
paper
with
no
misgiving
as
to
its
contents
but
having
read
it
i
could
not
do
this
so
beyond
a
petty
greeting
i
said
nothing
and
let
the
moment
pass
and
she
with
it
for
couples
were
dancing
and
she
was
soon
again
in
the
whirl
i
am
not
a
dancing
man
myself
and
i
had
leisure
to
think
and
madden
myself
with
contemplation
of
my
wrecked
life
and
questions
as
to
what
i
should
do
to
her
and
to
him
and
to
the
world
where
such
things
could
happen
i
had
forgotten
the
details
of
time
and
place
or
rather
had
put
them
out
of
my
mind
and
i
would
not
look
at
the
words
again
could
not
but
as
the
minutes
went
by
the
remembrance
returned
startling
and
convincing
that
the
hour
was
two
and
the
place
our
old
pavilion
i
walked
about
after
that
like
a
man
in
whose
breast
the
sources
of
life
are
frozen
i
chatted
i
who
never
chatted
with
women
and
with
men
i
even
smiled
once
that
was
when
my
little
wife
asked
me
if
it
were
not
time
to
go
home
even
a
man
under
torture
might
find
strength
to
smile
if
the
inquisitor
should
ask
if
he
were
not
ready
to
be
released
and
we
went
home
i
did
not
carry
her
this
time
across
the
driveway
but
when
we
parted
in
the
library
where
i
always
spent
an
hour
before
retiring
i
picked
out
a
lily
from
a
vase
of
flowers
standing
on
my
desk
and
held
it
out
to
her
she
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
quite
as
white
as
the
lily
then
she
slowly
put
out
her
hand
and
took
it
i
felt
no
mercy
after
that
and
bade
her
with
the
remark
that
i
should
have
to
write
far
into
the
morning
and
that
she
need
not
worry
over
my
light
which
i
should
not
probably
put
out
till
she
was
half
through
with
her
night
rest
for
answer
she
dropped
the
lily
i
found
it
next
morning
lying
withered
and
brown
in
the
that
light
did
burn
far
into
the
morning
but
i
was
not
there
to
trim
it
before
the
fatal
hour
had
struck
i
had
left
the
house
and
made
my
way
to
the
pavilion
as
i
crossed
the
sward
i
saw
the
gleam
of
a
lantern
at
the
masthead
of
a
small
boat
riding
near
our
own
and
i
understood
where
he
was
at
this
hour
and
by
what
route
he
hoped
to
take
my
darling
a
route
she
will
never
travel
thought
i
striving
to
keep
out
of
my
mind
and
conscience
the
vision
of
another
route
another
travel
which
that
sweet
young
body
might
take
if
my
mood
held
and
my
purpose
strengthened
there
was
no
moon
that
night
and
the
copse
in
which
our
pavilion
stands
was
like
a
blot
against
the
starless
heavens
as
i
drew
near
it
my
dog
the
invariable
companion
of
my
walks
lifted
a
short
sharp
bark
from
the
stables
but
i
knew
whose
hand
had
fastened
him
and
i
went
on
without
giving
him
a
thought
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
i
stopped
all
was
dark
within
as
without
and
the
silence
was
something
to
overwhelm
the
heart
she
was
not
there
then
nor
was
he
but
he
would
be
coming
soon
and
up
or
down
between
the
double
i
went
to
meet
him
it
was
a
small
detail
but
possibly
a
necessary
one
in
her
eyes
he
was
probably
handsome
and
gifted
with
all
that
i
openly
lacked
but
he
was
shallow
and
small
for
a
man
like
me
to
be
concerned
about
i
laughed
inwardly
and
with
very
conceivable
scorn
as
i
heard
the
faint
fall
of
his
footsteps
in
the
darkness
it
was
nearly
two
and
he
meant
to
be
prompt
our
coming
together
in
that
narrow
path
was
very
much
what
i
expected
it
to
be
i
had
put
out
my
arms
and
touched
the
hedge
on
either
side
so
that
he
could
not
escape
me
when
i
heard
him
drawing
close
i
found
the
voice
i
had
not
had
for
her
and
observed
very
quietly
and
with
the
cold
politeness
of
a
messenger
my
wife
finds
herself
indisposed
since
the
ball
and
begs
to
be
excused
from
joining
you
in
the
pleasant
sail
you
proposed
to
her
that
and
no
more
except
that
when
he
started
and
almost
fell
into
my
arms
i
found
strength
to
add
the
wind
blows
fresh
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
leaving
this
shore
the
difficulty
will
be
to
return
i
had
no
heart
to
kill
him
he
was
young
and
he
was
frightened
i
heard
the
sob
in
his
throat
as
i
dropped
my
arm
and
he
went
flying
down
to
the
river
this
was
child
play
the
rest
my
portion
is
to
tell
it
forty
years
ago
it
all
befell
and
till
now
no
word
of
it
has
ever
left
my
lips
there
was
no
sound
of
her
advancing
tread
across
the
lawn
as
i
stepped
back
into
my
own
grounds
to
enter
the
pavilion
but
as
i
left
the
path
and
put
foot
inside
the
wall
i
heard
a
far
faint
sound
like
the
harsh
closing
of
a
door
in
timid
hands
followed
by
another
bark
from
the
dog
louder
and
sharper
than
the
first
for
he
did
not
recognize
my
aline
as
mistress
though
i
had
striven
for
six
months
to
teach
him
the
place
she
held
in
my
heart
by
this
i
knew
she
was
coming
and
that
what
preparations
i
had
to
make
must
be
made
soon
they
were
not
many
entering
the
place
i
lit
the
lantern
i
had
brought
with
me
and
set
it
down
near
the
door
it
cast
a
feeble
light
about
the
entrance
but
left
great
shadows
in
the
rear
this
i
had
calculated
on
and
into
these
shadows
i
now
stepped
the
pavilion
as
you
remember
it
is
not
what
it
was
then
i
had
used
it
little
fancying
more
my
own
library
up
at
the
house
but
it
was
not
utterly
without
furnishings
and
to
young
eyes
might
even
look
attractive
with
love
or
fancied
love
to
mellow
its
harsh
lines
and
lend
romance
to
its
solitude
at
this
hour
and
under
these
circumstances
it
was
a
dismal
hole
to
me
and
as
i
stood
there
waiting
i
thought
how
the
place
fitted
the
deed
if
deed
it
was
to
be
i
had
always
thought
her
timid
afraid
of
the
night
and
all
threatening
things
but
as
i
listened
to
the
sound
of
her
soft
footfall
at
the
door
i
realized
that
even
her
breast
could
grow
strong
under
the
influence
of
a
real
or
fancied
passion
it
was
a
shock
but
i
did
not
cry
out
only
set
my
teeth
together
and
turned
a
little
so
that
what
light
there
was
would
fall
on
my
form
rather
than
on
my
face
she
entered
i
felt
rather
than
heard
the
tremulous
push
she
gave
to
the
door
and
the
quick
drawing
in
of
her
breath
as
she
put
her
foot
across
the
threshold
these
sapped
my
courage
this
fear
this
almost
hesitation
drew
me
from
thoughts
of
myself
to
thoughts
of
her
and
it
was
in
a
daze
of
mingled
purposes
and
regrets
that
i
felt
her
at
last
at
my
side
walter
fell
softly
doubtfully
from
her
lips
it
was
the
name
of
him
the
dip
of
whose
oars
as
he
made
for
his
boat
i
could
now
faintly
hear
in
the
river
below
us
turning
i
looked
her
in
the
face
you
are
late
said
i
god
gave
me
words
in
my
extremity
walter
has
gone
then
as
the
madness
of
terror
replaced
love
in
her
eyes
i
lifted
her
forcibly
and
carried
her
to
the
window
where
i
drew
aside
the
vines
that
is
his
boat
lantern
you
see
drawing
away
from
the
dock
i
bade
him
he
will
not
come
again
without
a
word
she
looked
then
fell
back
on
my
arm
it
was
not
life
which
forsook
her
face
and
left
her
whole
sweet
body
inert
that
i
could
have
borne
for
did
she
not
merit
death
who
had
killed
my
love
killed
me
but
happiness
the
glow
of
youthful
blood
the
dreams
of
a
youthful
brain
and
seeing
this
seeing
that
the
heart
i
thought
a
child
heart
had
gone
down
in
this
shipwreck
i
felt
my
anger
swell
and
master
me
body
and
soul
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
towering
over
her
and
she
was
cowering
at
my
feet
crushed
and
with
hands
held
up
in
defense
hands
that
had
been
like
in
my
grasp
futile
hands
but
raised
now
in
entreaty
for
her
life
to
me
to
me
who
had
loved
her
why
did
they
not
move
me
why
did
my
muscles
tighten
instead
of
relax
i
do
not
know
i
had
never
thought
myself
a
cruel
man
but
at
that
instant
i
felt
that
this
toy
of
my
strong
manhood
had
done
harm
far
beyond
its
value
and
that
it
would
comfort
me
to
break
it
and
toss
it
far
aside
only
i
could
not
bear
the
cry
which
now
left
her
lips
i
am
so
young
not
yet
not
yet
philo
i
am
so
young
let
me
live
a
little
while
was
it
a
woman
plea
conscious
of
the
tenderness
she
appealed
to
or
only
a
child
instinctive
grasping
after
life
just
life
if
it
were
the
first
it
would
be
easy
to
finish
but
a
child
terror
a
child
longing
that
pulled
hard
at
my
manhood
and
under
the
possibility
my
own
arm
fell
instantly
her
head
drooped
no
defense
did
she
utter
no
further
plea
did
she
make
she
simply
waited
you
have
deserved
death
this
i
managed
to
utter
but
if
you
will
swear
to
obey
me
you
shall
not
pay
your
forfeit
till
you
have
had
a
further
taste
of
life
not
in
my
house
there
is
not
sufficient
freedom
within
its
walls
for
you
but
in
the
broad
world
where
people
dance
and
sing
and
grow
old
at
their
leisure
without
duty
and
without
care
for
three
months
you
shall
have
this
and
have
it
to
your
heart
content
then
you
shall
come
back
to
me
my
true
wife
if
your
heart
so
prompts
if
not
to
tell
me
of
your
failure
and
quit
me
for
ever
but
here
i
fear
my
voice
grew
terrible
for
her
hands
instinctively
rose
again
those
three
months
must
be
lived
unstained
as
you
are
in
god
sight
this
hour
i
demand
of
you
to
swear
that
if
you
forget
this
or
disregard
it
or
for
any
cause
subject
my
name
to
dishonor
that
you
will
return
unbidden
at
the
first
moment
your
reason
returns
to
you
to
take
what
punishment
i
will
on
this
condition
i
send
you
away
aline
will
you
promise
she
did
not
answer
but
her
face
rose
i
did
not
understand
its
look
there
was
pathos
in
it
and
something
else
that
something
else
troubled
me
are
you
dissatisfied
i
asked
is
the
time
too
short
do
you
want
more
months
for
dancing
she
shook
her
head
and
the
little
hands
rose
again
do
not
send
me
away
she
faintly
entreated
i
do
know
why
but
i
had
rather
stay
with
me
impossible
are
you
ready
to
promise
aline
then
she
rose
and
looked
me
in
the
eye
with
courage
almost
with
resolution
as
i
live
said
she
and
i
knew
she
would
keep
her
word
the
next
thing
i
remember
of
that
night
was
the
sight
of
her
little
white
shivering
figure
looking
out
at
me
from
the
carriage
that
was
to
carry
her
away
the
night
was
cold
and
i
had
tucked
her
in
with
as
much
care
as
i
might
have
done
the
evening
before
when
i
still
worshiped
her
still
thought
her
mine
or
at
least
as
much
mine
as
she
was
any
one
when
i
had
done
this
and
pressed
a
generous
gift
into
her
hand
i
stood
a
minute
at
the
carriage
door
in
pity
of
her
aspect
she
looked
so
pinched
and
pale
so
dazed
and
hopeless
had
she
been
alone
but
the
companion
with
whom
i
had
provided
her
was
at
her
side
and
my
tongue
was
tied
i
turned
and
the
driver
started
up
the
horses
philo
i
heard
blown
by
me
on
the
wind
was
it
she
who
called
no
for
there
was
anguish
in
the
cry
the
anguish
of
a
woman
and
she
was
only
a
frightened
disheartened
child
whom
i
had
sent
away
to
dance
one
month
two
months
went
by
and
i
began
to
take
up
my
life
another
and
she
would
be
home
for
good
or
ill
i
thought
that
i
could
live
through
that
other
i
had
heard
of
her
not
from
her
that
i
did
not
require
and
the
stories
were
all
of
the
same
character
she
was
enjoying
life
in
the
great
city
to
which
i
had
sent
her
radiant
at
night
if
a
little
spiritless
by
day
she
was
at
balls
at
concerts
and
at
theaters
she
wore
jewels
and
shone
with
the
best
i
might
be
proud
of
her
conquests
and
the
sweetness
and
dignity
with
which
she
bore
herself
thus
her
friends
wrote
but
she
wrote
nothing
i
had
not
required
it
once
some
one
a
visitor
at
the
house
spoke
of
having
seen
her
she
was
surrounded
with
admirers
he
had
said
how
early
our
american
women
ripen
was
his
comment
she
held
her
head
like
one
who
has
held
sway
for
years
but
i
thought
her
a
trifle
worn
as
if
pleasure
absorbed
too
much
of
her
sleep
you
must
look
out
for
her
judge
and
i
smiled
grimly
enough
i
own
to
think
just
how
i
was
looking
out
for
her
then
came
the
thunderbolt
i
am
told
that
no
one
ever
sees
her
in
the
that
she
is
always
busy
days
but
she
does
not
look
as
if
she
took
that
time
for
rest
what
can
your
little
wife
be
doing
you
ought
to
hurry
up
that
important
opinion
of
yours
and
go
see
he
was
right
what
was
she
doing
and
why
should
i
go
see
there
was
no
obstacle
but
my
own
will
but
that
is
the
greatest
obstacle
a
man
can
have
i
remained
at
homewood
but
the
four
weeks
of
our
further
probation
looked
like
a
year
meanwhile
i
had
my
way
with
the
pavilion
i
have
shown
you
my
heart
sometimes
at
its
best
oftenest
at
its
worst
i
will
show
it
to
you
again
in
this
i
had
a
wall
built
round
it
close
against
the
thicket
in
which
it
lay
embedded
this
wall
was
painted
white
and
near
it
i
had
lamps
placed
which
were
lit
at
nightfall
should
a
figure
pass
that
wall
i
could
see
it
from
my
window
no
one
could
enter
that
doorway
now
without
running
the
risk
of
my
seeing
him
from
where
i
sat
at
my
desk
did
i
feel
easier
i
do
not
know
that
i
did
i
merely
followed
an
impulse
i
dared
not
name
to
myself
two
weeks
of
this
final
month
went
by
then
it
was
in
the
evening
some
one
came
running
up
from
the
grounds
with
the
message
that
ocumpaugh
had
ridden
into
the
gate
but
that
she
was
not
ready
to
enter
the
house
would
i
meet
her
at
the
pavilion
i
was
in
the
library
at
my
desk
with
my
eyes
on
the
wall
when
this
was
told
me
i
had
just
seen
the
fierce
figure
of
that
unmanageable
dog
of
mine
run
by
that
white
surface
and
my
lips
were
open
to
order
him
tied
up
when
he
and
everything
else
in
this
whole
world
was
forgotten
in
this
crushing
news
of
her
return
for
the
three
months
were
not
up
and
her
presence
here
could
mean
but
one
thing
she
had
found
temptation
too
much
for
her
and
she
had
come
back
to
tell
me
so
in
obedience
to
her
promise
i
will
go
meet
ocumpaugh
i
said
the
man
stared
i
will
go
meet
ocumpaugh
now
i
repeated
and
tried
to
rise
but
my
limbs
refused
death
had
entered
my
heart
and
it
was
some
few
minutes
before
i
found
myself
upon
the
lawn
outside
when
i
got
there
i
was
trembling
and
so
uncertain
of
movement
that
i
tottered
at
the
gate
but
seeing
signs
of
her
presence
within
i
straightened
myself
and
went
in
she
was
standing
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
room
when
i
entered
in
the
full
light
of
the
solitary
moonbeam
which
shot
in
at
the
western
casement
she
had
thrown
aside
her
hat
and
coat
and
never
in
all
my
life
had
i
seen
anything
so
ethereal
as
the
worn
face
and
wasted
form
she
thus
disclosed
had
it
not
been
for
the
haunting
and
pathetic
smile
which
by
some
freak
of
fate
gave
poignancy
to
her
otherwise
infantile
beauty
i
should
not
have
known
the
woman
who
stood
there
with
my
name
formed
on
her
lips
destroyed
was
my
thought
and
the
rage
which
i
felt
that
moment
against
fate
flushed
my
whole
being
and
my
arms
went
up
not
in
threat
against
her
but
to
an
avenging
heaven
when
i
heard
an
impetuous
rush
an
angry
growl
and
the
delicate
trembling
figure
went
down
under
the
leap
of
the
monstrous
animal
which
i
had
taught
to
love
me
but
could
never
teach
to
love
her
in
horror
and
unspeakable
anguish
of
soul
i
called
off
the
dog
and
stooping
with
bitter
cries
i
took
her
in
my
arms
hurt
i
gasped
hurt
aline
i
looked
at
her
anxiously
no
she
whispered
happy
and
before
i
realized
my
own
feelings
or
the
passion
with
which
i
drew
her
to
my
breast
she
had
nestled
her
head
against
my
heart
smiled
and
died
the
shock
of
the
dog
onslaught
had
killed
her
i
would
not
believe
it
at
first
but
when
i
was
quite
sure
i
took
out
the
pistol
i
carried
in
my
breast
and
shot
the
cowering
brute
midway
between
the
eyes
when
this
was
done
i
turned
back
to
her
there
was
no
light
but
the
moon
and
i
needed
no
other
the
clear
beams
falling
on
her
face
made
her
look
pure
and
stainless
and
sweet
i
could
almost
have
loved
her
again
as
i
marked
the
tender
smile
which
lingered
from
that
passing
moment
on
her
lips
happy
she
had
said
what
did
she
mean
by
that
happy
as
i
asked
myself
i
heard
a
cry
the
companion
who
had
been
with
her
had
rushed
in
at
the
doorway
and
was
gazing
in
sorrow
and
amazement
at
the
white
form
lying
outstretched
and
senseless
against
that
farther
wall
oh
she
cried
in
a
tone
that
assured
me
she
had
not
seen
the
dog
lying
in
his
blood
at
my
back
dead
already
dead
at
the
first
glance
at
the
first
word
ah
she
knew
better
than
i
poor
lamb
i
thought
she
would
get
well
if
she
once
got
home
she
wearied
so
for
you
sir
and
for
homewood
i
thought
myself
quite
mad
past
understanding
aright
the
words
addressed
to
me
she
wearied
i
began
with
all
her
soul
for
you
and
homewood
the
young
woman
repeated
that
is
since
her
illness
developed
her
illness
yes
she
has
been
ill
ever
since
she
went
away
the
cold
of
that
first
journey
was
too
much
for
her
but
she
kept
up
for
several
weeks
doing
what
no
other
woman
ever
did
before
with
so
little
strength
and
so
little
hope
danced
at
night
and
and
and
what
by
day
what
i
could
hardly
get
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
studied
learned
what
she
thought
you
would
like
french
music
politics
it
was
to
have
been
a
surprise
poor
soul
it
took
her
very
life
she
did
not
sleep
oh
sir
what
is
it
i
was
standing
over
her
probably
a
terrifying
figure
lights
were
playing
before
my
eyes
strange
sounds
were
in
my
ears
everything
about
me
seemed
resolving
itself
into
chaos
what
do
you
mean
i
finally
gasped
she
studied
to
please
why
did
she
come
back
then
so
soon
i
paused
choked
i
had
been
about
to
give
away
my
secret
i
mean
why
did
she
come
thus
suddenly
without
warning
me
of
what
i
might
expect
i
would
have
gone
i
told
her
so
but
she
was
very
determined
to
come
to
you
herself
to
this
very
pavilion
she
had
set
the
time
later
but
this
morning
the
doctor
told
her
that
her
symptoms
were
alarming
and
without
consulting
him
or
heeding
the
advice
of
any
of
us
she
started
for
home
she
was
buoyant
on
the
way
and
more
than
once
i
heard
her
softly
repeating
your
name
her
heart
was
very
loving
oh
sir
you
are
ill
no
no
i
cried
crushing
my
hand
against
my
mouth
to
keep
down
the
cry
of
anguish
and
despair
which
tore
its
way
up
from
my
heart
before
other
hands
touch
her
other
eyes
see
her
tell
me
when
she
began
i
will
not
say
to
love
me
but
to
weary
for
me
and
homewood
perhaps
she
has
told
you
herself
here
is
the
letter
sir
she
bade
me
give
you
if
she
did
not
reach
here
alive
she
wrote
it
this
morning
after
the
doctor
told
her
what
i
have
said
give
give
she
put
it
in
my
hand
i
glanced
at
it
in
the
moonlight
read
the
first
few
words
and
felt
the
world
reel
round
me
thrusting
the
letter
in
my
breast
i
bade
the
woman
who
watched
me
with
fascinated
eyes
to
go
now
and
rouse
the
house
when
she
was
gone
i
stepped
back
into
the
shadows
and
catching
hold
of
the
murderous
beast
i
dragged
him
out
and
about
the
wall
to
a
thick
clump
of
bushes
here
i
left
him
and
went
back
to
my
darling
when
they
came
in
they
found
her
in
my
arms
her
head
had
fallen
back
and
i
was
staring
staring
at
her
white
throat
that
night
when
all
was
done
for
her
which
could
be
done
i
shut
myself
into
my
library
and
again
opened
that
precious
letter
i
give
it
to
show
how
men
may
be
mistaken
when
they
seek
to
weigh
women
souls
i
love
you
as
i
shall
be
dead
when
you
read
this
i
may
say
so
without
fear
of
rebuff
i
did
not
love
you
then
i
did
not
love
anybody
i
was
thoughtless
and
fond
of
pleasure
and
craved
affectionate
words
he
saw
this
and
worked
on
my
folly
but
when
his
project
failed
and
i
saw
his
boat
creep
away
i
found
that
what
feeling
i
had
was
for
the
man
who
had
thwarted
him
and
i
felt
myself
saved
if
i
had
not
taken
cold
that
night
i
might
have
lived
to
prove
this
i
know
that
you
do
not
love
me
very
much
but
perhaps
you
would
have
done
so
had
you
seen
me
grow
a
little
wiser
and
more
like
what
your
wife
should
be
i
was
trying
when
o
philo
i
can
not
write
i
can
not
think
i
am
coming
to
you
i
love
forgive
and
take
me
back
again
alive
or
dead
i
love
you
i
love
as
i
finished
the
light
which
had
been
burning
low
suddenly
went
out
the
window
which
opened
before
me
was
still
unshuttered
before
me
across
the
wide
spaces
of
the
lawn
shone
the
pavilion
wall
white
in
the
moonlight
as
i
stared
in
horror
at
it
a
trembling
seized
my
whole
body
and
the
hair
on
my
head
rose
the
dark
figure
of
a
running
dog
had
passed
across
it
dog
which
lay
dead
under
the
god
punishment
i
murmured
and
laid
my
head
down
on
that
pathetic
letter
and
sobbed
the
morning
found
me
there
it
was
not
till
later
that
the
man
sent
to
bury
the
dog
came
to
me
with
the
cry
something
is
wrong
with
the
pavilion
when
i
went
in
to
close
the
window
i
found
the
ceiling
at
that
end
of
the
room
strangely
dabbled
it
looks
like
blood
and
the
spots
grew
as
i
looked
aghast
bruised
in
spirit
and
broken
of
heart
i
went
down
after
that
sweet
body
was
laid
in
its
grave
to
look
the
stains
he
had
spoken
of
were
gone
but
i
lived
to
see
them
reappear
as
you
have
god
have
mercy
on
our
souls
xii
behind
the
wall
a
most
pathetic
and
awesome
history
i
exclaimed
after
the
pause
which
instinctively
followed
the
completion
of
this
tale
read
as
few
of
its
kind
have
ever
been
read
by
this
woman
of
infinite
resources
in
feeling
and
expression
is
it
not
do
you
wonder
that
a
visit
in
the
dead
of
night
to
a
spot
associated
with
such
superstitious
horrors
should
frighten
me
she
added
as
she
bundled
up
the
scattered
sheets
with
a
reckless
hand
i
do
not
i
am
not
sure
but
that
i
am
a
little
bit
frightened
myself
i
smiled
following
with
my
eye
a
single
sheet
which
had
escaped
to
the
floor
allow
me
i
cried
stooping
to
lift
it
as
i
did
so
i
observed
that
it
was
the
first
sheet
the
torn
one
and
that
a
line
or
so
of
writing
was
visible
at
the
top
which
i
was
sure
had
not
been
amongst
those
she
had
read
what
words
are
those
i
asked
i
do
know
they
are
half
gone
as
you
can
see
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
i
read
you
the
whole
of
that
mistress
as
she
was
of
her
moods
and
expression
i
detected
traces
of
some
slight
confusion
the
putting
up
of
the
partition
is
not
explained
i
remarked
oh
that
was
put
up
in
horror
of
the
stains
which
from
time
to
time
broke
out
on
the
ceiling
at
that
end
of
the
room
i
wished
to
ask
her
if
this
was
her
conclusion
or
if
that
line
or
two
i
have
mentioned
was
more
intelligible
than
she
had
acknowledged
it
to
be
but
i
refrained
from
a
sense
of
propriety
if
she
appreciated
my
forbearance
she
did
not
show
it
rising
she
thrust
the
papers
into
a
cupboard
casting
a
scarcely
perceptible
glance
at
the
clock
as
she
did
so
i
took
the
hint
and
rose
instantly
she
was
all
smiles
you
have
forgotten
something
trevitt
surely
you
do
not
intend
to
carry
away
with
you
my
key
to
the
bungalow
i
was
thinking
of
it
i
returned
lightly
i
am
not
quite
through
with
that
key
then
before
she
could
recover
from
her
surprise
i
added
with
such
suavity
as
i
had
been
able
to
acquire
in
my
intercourse
with
my
more
cultivated
clients
i
have
to
thank
you
carew
for
an
hour
of
thrilling
interest
absorbed
though
i
am
in
the
present
mystery
my
mind
has
room
for
the
old
one
possibly
because
there
is
sometimes
a
marked
connection
between
old
family
events
and
new
there
may
be
some
such
connection
in
this
case
i
should
like
the
opportunity
of
assuring
myself
there
is
not
she
said
nothing
i
thought
i
understood
why
more
suavely
yet
i
continued
with
a
slight
a
very
slight
movement
toward
the
door
rarely
have
i
had
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
such
a
tale
read
by
such
an
interpreter
it
will
always
remain
in
my
memory
carew
but
the
episode
is
over
and
i
return
to
my
present
duty
and
the
bungalow
the
bungalow
you
are
going
back
to
the
bungalow
immediately
what
for
did
you
see
all
there
was
to
see
not
quite
i
do
know
what
there
can
be
left
nothing
of
consequence
most
likely
but
you
can
not
wish
me
to
have
any
doubts
on
the
subject
no
no
of
course
not
the
carelessness
of
her
tone
did
not
communicate
itself
to
her
manner
seeing
that
my
unexpected
proposition
had
roused
her
alarm
i
grew
wary
and
remarked
i
was
always
overscrupulous
with
a
lift
of
her
shoulders
a
dainty
gesture
which
i
congratulated
myself
i
could
see
unmoved
she
held
out
her
hand
in
a
mute
appeal
for
the
key
but
seeing
that
i
was
not
to
be
shaken
in
my
purpose
reached
for
the
wrap
she
had
tossed
on
a
chair
and
tied
it
again
over
her
head
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
asked
accompany
you
she
declared
again
i
thought
the
place
frightened
you
it
does
she
replied
i
had
rather
visit
any
other
spot
in
the
whole
world
but
if
it
is
your
intention
to
go
back
there
it
is
mine
to
go
with
you
you
are
very
good
i
replied
but
i
was
seriously
disconcerted
notwithstanding
i
had
reckoned
upon
a
quiet
hour
in
the
bungalow
by
myself
moreover
i
did
not
understand
her
motive
for
never
trusting
me
there
alone
yet
as
this
very
distrust
was
suggestive
i
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
welcomed
her
company
with
becoming
alacrity
after
all
i
might
gain
more
than
i
could
possibly
lose
by
having
her
under
my
eye
for
a
little
longer
strong
as
was
her
there
were
moments
when
the
real
woman
showed
herself
and
these
moments
were
productive
as
we
were
passing
out
she
paused
to
extinguish
a
lamp
which
was
slightly
smoking
i
also
thought
she
paused
an
instant
to
listen
at
all
events
her
ears
were
turned
toward
the
stairs
down
which
there
came
the
murmur
of
two
voices
one
of
them
the
little
boy
it
is
time
harry
was
asleep
she
cried
i
promised
to
sing
to
him
you
wo
be
long
will
you
you
need
not
be
very
long
was
my
significant
retort
i
can
not
speak
for
myself
was
i
playing
with
her
curiosity
or
anxieties
or
whatever
it
was
that
affected
her
i
hardly
knew
i
spoke
as
impulse
directed
and
waited
in
cold
blood
or
was
it
hot
blood
to
see
how
she
took
it
carelessly
enough
for
she
was
a
famous
actress
except
when
taken
by
surprise
checking
an
evident
desire
of
calling
out
some
direction
up
stairs
she
followed
me
to
the
door
remarking
cheerfully
you
can
not
be
very
long
either
the
place
is
not
large
enough
my
excuse
or
rather
the
one
i
made
to
myself
for
thus
returning
to
a
place
i
had
seemingly
exhausted
was
this
in
the
quick
turn
i
had
made
in
leaving
on
the
former
occasion
my
foot
had
struck
the
edge
of
the
large
rug
nailed
over
the
center
of
the
floor
and
unaccountably
loosened
it
to
rectify
this
mishap
and
also
to
see
how
so
slight
a
shock
could
have
lifted
the
large
brass
nails
by
which
it
had
been
held
down
to
the
floor
seemed
reason
enough
for
my
action
but
how
to
draw
her
attention
to
so
insignificant
a
fact
without
incurring
her
ridicule
i
could
not
decide
in
our
brief
passage
back
to
the
bungalow
and
consequently
was
greatly
relieved
when
upon
opening
the
door
and
turning
my
lantern
on
the
scene
i
discovered
that
in
our
absence
the
rug
had
torn
itself
still
farther
free
from
the
floor
and
now
lay
with
one
of
its
corners
well
curled
over
the
corner
farthest
from
the
door
and
nearest
the
divan
where
little
gwendolen
had
been
lying
when
she
was
lifted
and
carried
away
where
carew
saw
it
too
and
cast
me
a
startled
look
which
i
met
with
a
smile
possibly
as
ambiguous
as
the
feeling
which
prompted
it
who
has
been
here
she
asked
ourselves
did
we
do
that
i
did
or
rather
my
foot
struck
the
edge
of
the
rug
as
i
turned
to
go
out
with
you
shall
i
replace
it
and
press
back
the
nails
if
you
will
be
so
good
do
what
she
would
there
was
eagerness
in
her
tone
remarking
this
i
decided
to
give
another
and
closer
look
at
the
floor
and
the
nails
i
found
the
latter
had
not
been
properly
inserted
or
rather
that
there
were
two
indentations
for
every
nail
a
deep
one
and
one
quite
shallow
this
caused
me
to
make
some
examination
of
the
others
those
which
had
not
been
drawn
from
the
floor
and
i
found
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
equally
insecure
but
not
all
only
those
about
this
one
corner
carew
who
had
paused
confused
and
faltering
in
the
doorway
in
her
dismay
at
seeing
me
engaged
in
this
inspection
instead
of
in
replacing
the
rug
as
i
had
proposed
now
advanced
a
step
so
that
our
glances
met
as
i
looked
up
with
the
remark
this
rug
seems
to
have
been
lately
raised
at
this
corner
do
you
know
if
the
police
had
it
up
i
do
i
believe
so
oh
trevitt
she
cried
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
with
the
corner
of
the
rug
in
my
hand
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
had
run
forward
impetuously
and
was
now
standing
close
beside
me
inconveniently
close
i
am
going
to
raise
this
rug
i
informed
her
that
is
just
at
this
corner
pardon
me
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
move
certainly
of
course
she
stammered
oh
what
is
going
to
happen
now
then
as
she
watched
me
there
is
there
something
under
it
a
door
in
the
floor
a
a
ocumpaugh
never
told
me
of
this
do
you
suppose
she
knew
it
i
inquired
looking
up
into
her
face
which
was
very
near
but
not
near
enough
to
be
in
the
full
light
of
the
lantern
which
was
pointed
another
way
this
rug
appears
to
have
been
almost
soldered
to
the
floor
everywhere
but
here
there
it
is
thrown
back
now
if
you
will
be
so
very
good
as
to
hold
the
lantern
i
will
try
and
lift
up
the
door
i
can
not
see
how
my
hands
shake
what
are
we
about
to
discover
nothing
i
pray
nothing
suspense
would
be
better
than
that
i
think
you
will
be
able
to
hold
it
i
urged
pressing
the
lantern
upon
her
yes
i
have
never
been
devoid
of
courage
but
but
do
ask
me
to
descend
with
you
she
prayed
as
she
lifted
the
lantern
and
turned
it
dexterously
enough
on
that
portion
of
the
door
where
a
ring
lay
outlined
in
the
depths
of
its
outermost
plank
i
will
not
but
you
will
come
just
the
same
you
can
not
help
it
i
hazarded
as
with
the
point
of
my
i
lifted
the
small
round
of
wood
which
filled
into
the
ring
and
thus
made
the
floor
level
now
if
this
door
is
not
locked
we
will
have
it
up
i
cried
pulling
at
the
ring
with
a
will
the
door
was
not
locked
and
it
came
up
readily
enough
discovering
some
steps
down
which
i
immediately
proceeded
to
climb
oh
i
can
not
stay
here
alone
she
protested
and
prepared
to
follow
me
in
haste
just
as
i
expected
her
to
do
the
moment
she
saw
the
light
withdrawn
step
carefully
i
enjoined
if
you
will
honor
me
with
your
hand
but
she
was
at
my
side
before
the
words
were
well
out
what
is
it
what
kind
of
place
do
you
make
it
out
to
be
and
is
there
anything
here
you
do
not
want
to
see
i
flashed
the
light
around
and
incidentally
on
her
she
was
not
trembling
now
her
cheeks
were
red
her
eyes
blazing
she
was
looking
at
me
and
not
at
the
darksome
place
about
her
but
as
this
was
natural
it
being
a
woman
way
to
look
for
what
she
desires
to
learn
in
the
face
of
the
man
who
for
the
moment
is
her
protector
i
shifted
the
light
into
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
low
damp
cellar
in
which
we
now
found
ourselves
bins
for
wine
and
beer
i
observed
but
nothing
in
them
then
as
i
measured
the
space
before
me
with
my
eye
it
runs
under
the
whole
house
see
it
is
much
larger
than
the
room
above
yes
she
mechanically
repeated
i
lowered
the
lantern
to
the
floor
but
quickly
raised
it
again
what
is
that
on
the
other
side
i
queried
i
am
sure
there
is
a
break
in
the
wall
over
in
that
corner
i
can
not
see
she
gasped
certainly
she
was
very
much
frightened
are
you
going
to
cross
the
floor
yes
and
if
you
do
not
wish
to
follow
me
sit
down
on
these
steps
no
i
will
go
where
you
go
but
this
is
very
fearful
why
what
is
the
matter
i
had
stepped
aside
in
order
to
avoid
a
trail
of
footprints
i
saw
extending
across
the
cellar
floor
come
around
this
way
i
urged
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
keep
you
from
being
too
much
frightened
she
did
as
i
told
her
softly
her
steps
fell
in
behind
mine
and
thus
with
wary
tread
and
peering
eyes
we
made
our
way
to
the
remote
end
where
we
found
or
rather
where
i
found
that
the
break
which
i
had
noticed
in
the
uniformity
of
the
wall
was
occasioned
by
a
pile
of
old
boxes
arranged
so
as
to
make
steps
up
to
a
hole
cut
through
the
floor
above
with
a
sharp
movement
i
wheeled
upon
her
do
you
see
that
i
asked
pointing
back
over
my
shoulder
steps
she
cried
going
up
into
that
part
of
the
building
where
where
will
you
attempt
them
with
me
or
will
you
stay
here
in
the
darkness
i
will
stay
here
it
was
said
with
shortened
breath
but
she
seemed
less
frightened
than
when
we
started
to
cross
the
cellar
at
all
events
a
fine
look
of
daring
had
displaced
the
tremulous
aspect
which
had
so
changed
the
character
of
her
countenance
a
few
minutes
before
i
will
make
short
work
of
it
i
assured
her
as
i
hastily
ran
up
the
steps
drop
your
face
into
your
hands
and
you
will
not
be
conscious
of
the
darkness
besides
i
will
talk
to
you
all
the
time
there
i
have
worked
my
way
up
through
the
hole
i
have
placed
my
lantern
on
the
floor
above
and
i
see
what
are
you
coming
yes
i
am
coming
indeed
she
was
close
beside
me
maintaining
her
footing
on
the
toppling
boxes
by
a
grip
on
my
disengaged
arm
can
you
see
i
asked
wait
let
me
pull
you
up
we
might
as
well
stand
on
the
floor
as
on
these
boxes
climbing
into
the
room
above
i
offered
her
my
hand
and
in
another
moment
we
stood
together
in
the
noisome
precincts
of
that
abominable
spot
with
whose
doleful
story
she
had
just
made
me
acquainted
a
square
of
impenetrable
gloom
confronted
me
at
the
first
glance
what
might
not
be
the
result
of
a
second
i
turned
to
consult
the
appearance
of
the
lady
beside
me
before
i
took
this
second
look
had
she
the
strength
to
stand
the
ordeal
was
she
as
much
moved
or
possibly
more
moved
than
myself
as
a
woman
and
the
intimate
friend
of
the
ocumpaughs
she
should
be
but
i
could
not
perceive
that
she
was
for
some
reason
once
in
view
of
this
mysterious
place
she
was
strangely
inexplicably
impassibly
calm
you
can
bear
it
i
queried
i
must
only
end
it
quickly
i
will
i
replied
and
i
held
out
my
lantern
i
am
not
a
superstitious
man
but
instinctively
i
looked
up
before
i
looked
about
me
i
have
no
doubt
that
carew
did
the
same
but
no
stains
were
to
be
seen
on
those
blackened
boards
now
or
rather
they
were
dark
with
one
continuous
stain
and
next
moment
i
was
examining
with
eager
scrutiny
the
place
itself
accustomed
to
the
appearance
of
the
cheerful
and
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
it
was
a
shock
to
me
i
will
not
say
what
it
was
to
her
to
meet
the
bare
decaying
walls
and
mouldering
appurtenances
of
this
dismal
hole
true
we
had
just
come
from
a
description
of
the
place
in
all
the
neglect
of
its
many
years
of
desolation
yet
the
smart
finish
of
the
open
portion
we
had
just
left
poorly
prepared
us
for
what
we
here
encountered
but
the
first
impression
over
an
impression
which
was
to
recur
to
me
many
a
night
afterward
in
dreams
i
remembered
the
nearer
and
more
imperative
cause
which
had
drawn
us
thither
and
turning
the
light
into
each
and
every
corner
looked
eagerly
for
what
i
so
much
dreaded
to
find
a
couch
to
which
some
old
cushions
still
clung
stood
against
the
farther
wall
thank
god
it
was
empty
so
were
all
the
corners
of
the
room
nothing
living
and
nothing
dead
turning
quickly
upon
carew
i
made
haste
to
assure
her
that
our
fears
were
quite
unfounded
but
she
was
not
even
looking
my
way
her
eyes
were
on
the
ground
and
she
seemed
merely
waiting
in
some
impatience
evidently
but
yet
merely
waiting
for
me
to
finish
and
be
gone
this
was
certainly
odd
for
the
place
was
calculated
in
itself
to
rouse
curiosity
especially
in
one
who
knew
its
story
a
table
thick
with
dust
and
blurred
with
dampness
still
gave
tokens
of
a
bygone
festivity
among
which
a
bottle
and
some
glasses
stood
conspicuous
cards
were
there
too
dingy
and
green
with
mould
some
on
the
tables
some
on
the
floor
while
the
open
lid
of
a
small
desk
pushed
up
close
to
a
full
of
books
still
held
a
rusty
pen
and
the
remnants
of
what
looked
like
the
mouldering
sheets
of
unused
paper
as
for
the
rest
desolation
neglect
horror
but
no
the
relief
was
enormous
it
is
a
dreadful
place
i
exclaimed
but
it
might
have
been
worse
do
you
want
to
see
things
nearer
shall
we
cross
the
floor
no
no
we
have
not
found
gwendolen
let
us
go
oh
let
us
go
a
thrill
of
feeling
had
crept
into
her
voice
who
could
wonder
yet
i
was
not
ready
to
humor
her
very
natural
sensibilities
by
leaving
quite
so
abruptly
the
floor
interested
me
the
cushions
of
that
old
couch
interested
me
the
sawn
boards
surrounding
the
hole
indeed
many
things
we
will
go
in
a
moment
i
assured
her
but
first
cast
your
eyes
along
the
floor
do
you
see
that
some
one
has
preceded
us
here
and
that
not
so
very
long
ago
some
one
with
dainty
feet
and
a
skirt
that
fell
on
the
ground
in
short
a
woman
and
a
lady
i
do
see
she
faltered
very
much
frightened
then
quickly
show
me
show
me
i
pointed
out
the
marks
in
the
heavy
dust
of
the
long
neglected
floor
they
were
unmistakable
oh
she
cried
what
it
is
to
be
a
detective
but
who
could
have
been
here
who
would
want
to
be
here
i
think
it
is
horrible
myself
and
if
i
were
alone
i
should
faint
from
terror
and
the
close
air
we
will
not
remain
much
longer
i
assured
her
going
straight
to
the
couch
i
do
not
like
it
either
but
what
have
you
found
now
her
voice
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
distance
behind
me
was
this
on
account
of
the
state
of
her
nerves
or
mine
i
am
willing
to
think
the
latter
for
at
that
moment
my
eye
took
in
two
unexpected
details
a
dent
as
of
a
child
head
in
one
of
the
mangy
and
a
crushed
bit
of
colored
sugar
which
must
once
have
been
a
bit
of
choice
confectionery
some
one
besides
a
lady
has
been
here
i
decided
pointing
to
the
one
and
bringing
back
the
other
see
this
bit
of
candy
is
quite
fresh
you
must
acknowledge
that
was
not
walled
up
years
ago
with
the
rest
of
the
things
we
see
about
us
her
eyes
stared
at
the
sugary
morsel
i
held
out
toward
her
in
my
open
palm
then
she
made
a
sudden
rush
which
took
her
to
the
side
of
the
couch
gwendolen
here
she
moaned
gwendolen
here
yes
i
began
do
not
but
she
had
already
left
the
spot
and
was
backing
toward
the
opening
up
which
we
had
come
as
she
met
my
eye
she
made
a
quick
turn
and
plunged
below
i
must
have
air
she
gasped
with
a
glance
at
the
floor
over
which
she
had
so
rapidly
passed
i
hastily
followed
her
smiling
grimly
to
myself
intentionally
or
unintentionally
she
had
by
this
quick
passage
to
and
fro
effectually
confused
if
not
entirely
obliterated
those
evidences
of
a
former
intrusion
which
with
misguided
judgment
i
had
just
pointed
out
to
her
but
recalling
the
still
more
perfect
line
of
footprints
left
below
to
which
i
had
not
called
her
attention
i
felt
that
i
could
afford
to
ignore
the
present
mishap
as
i
reached
the
cellar
bottom
i
called
to
her
for
she
was
already
across
did
you
notice
where
the
boards
had
been
sawed
i
asked
the
sawdust
is
still
on
the
floor
and
it
smells
as
fresh
as
if
the
saw
had
been
at
work
there
yesterday
no
doubt
no
doubt
she
answered
back
over
her
shoulder
still
hurrying
on
so
that
i
had
to
run
lest
she
should
attempt
the
steps
in
utter
darkness
when
i
reached
the
floor
of
the
bungalow
she
was
in
the
open
door
panting
watching
her
with
one
eye
i
drew
back
the
trap
into
place
and
replaced
the
rug
and
the
three
nails
i
had
loosened
then
i
shut
the
slide
of
the
lantern
and
joined
her
where
she
stood
do
you
feel
better
i
asked
it
was
a
dismal
quarter
of
an
hour
but
it
was
not
a
lost
one
she
drew
the
door
to
and
locked
it
before
she
answered
then
it
was
with
a
question
what
do
you
make
of
all
this
mr
trevitt
i
replied
as
directly
as
the
circumstances
demanded
madam
it
is
a
startling
answer
to
the
question
you
put
me
before
we
first
left
your
house
you
asked
then
if
the
child
in
the
wagon
was
gwendolen
how
could
it
have
been
she
with
this
evidence
before
us
of
her
having
been
concealed
here
at
the
very
time
that
wagon
was
being
driven
away
from
i
do
not
think
you
have
reason
enough
she
began
and
stopped
and
did
not
speak
again
till
we
halted
at
the
foot
of
her
own
porch
then
with
the
frank
accent
most
in
keeping
with
her
general
manner
however
much
i
might
distrust
both
accent
and
manner
she
added
as
if
no
interval
had
intervened
if
those
signs
you
noted
are
proofs
to
you
that
gwendolen
was
shut
up
in
that
portion
of
the
bungalow
while
some
were
seeking
her
in
the
water
and
others
in
the
wagon
where
is
she
xiii
we
shall
have
to
begin
again
it
was
a
leading
question
which
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
accompanied
by
a
very
sharp
look
from
beneath
the
cloudy
wrap
she
had
wound
about
her
head
you
suspect
some
one
or
something
continued
carew
with
a
return
of
the
indefinable
manner
which
had
characterized
her
in
the
beginning
of
our
interview
whom
what
i
should
have
liked
to
answer
her
candidly
and
in
the
spirit
if
not
the
words
of
the
prophet
of
old
but
her
womanliness
disarmed
me
with
her
eyes
on
me
i
could
get
no
further
than
a
polite
acknowledgment
of
defeat
carew
i
am
all
at
sea
we
shall
have
to
begin
again
yes
she
answered
like
an
echo
was
it
sadly
or
gladly
you
will
have
to
begin
again
then
with
a
regretful
accent
and
i
can
not
help
you
for
i
am
going
to
sail
i
positively
must
go
cablegrams
from
the
other
side
hurry
me
i
shall
have
to
leave
ocumpaugh
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
what
time
does
your
steamer
sail
mrs
carew
at
five
in
the
afternoon
from
the
cunard
docks
nearly
sixteen
hours
from
now
perhaps
fate
or
my
efforts
will
favor
us
before
then
with
some
solution
of
this
disheartening
problem
let
us
hope
so
a
quick
shudder
to
hide
which
she
was
reaching
out
her
hand
when
the
door
behind
us
opened
and
a
colored
girl
looked
out
instantly
and
with
the
slightest
possible
loss
of
carew
turned
to
motion
the
intruder
back
when
the
girl
suddenly
blurted
out
oh
carew
harry
is
so
restless
he
is
sleepy
he
says
i
will
be
up
instantly
tell
him
that
i
will
be
up
instantly
then
as
the
girl
disappeared
she
added
with
a
quick
smile
you
see
i
any
toys
for
him
not
being
a
mother
i
forgot
to
put
them
in
his
trunk
as
though
in
response
to
these
words
the
maid
again
showed
herself
in
the
doorway
oh
carew
she
eagerly
exclaimed
there
a
little
toy
in
the
hall
here
brought
over
by
one
of
ocumpaugh
maids
the
girl
said
that
hearing
that
the
little
boy
fretted
ocumpaugh
had
picked
out
one
of
her
little
girl
playthings
and
sent
it
over
with
her
love
it
a
little
horse
with
curly
mane
and
a
long
tail
i
am
sure
just
please
master
harry
carew
turned
upon
me
a
look
brimming
with
feeling
what
thoughtfulness
what
she
cried
take
up
the
horse
dinah
it
was
one
of
gwendolen
favorite
playthings
she
explained
to
me
as
the
girl
vanished
i
did
not
answer
i
was
hearing
again
in
my
mind
that
desolate
cry
of
philo
philo
philo
which
an
hour
or
so
before
had
rung
down
to
me
from
ocumpaugh
open
window
there
had
been
a
wildness
in
the
tone
which
spoke
of
a
tossing
head
on
a
feverish
pillow
certainly
an
irreconcilable
picture
with
the
one
just
suggested
by
carew
of
the
considerate
friend
sending
out
the
toys
of
her
lost
one
to
a
peevish
child
carew
appeared
to
notice
the
preoccupation
with
which
i
lingered
on
the
lower
step
you
like
children
she
hazarded
or
have
you
interested
yourself
in
this
matter
purely
from
business
reasons
business
reasons
were
sufficient
was
my
guarded
reply
but
i
like
children
very
much
i
should
be
most
happy
if
i
could
see
this
little
harry
of
yours
nearer
i
have
only
seen
him
from
a
distance
you
know
she
drew
back
a
step
then
she
met
my
look
squarely
in
the
moonlight
her
face
was
flushed
but
i
attempted
no
apology
for
a
presumption
which
could
have
but
one
excuse
i
meant
that
she
should
understand
me
if
i
did
not
her
you
love
children
she
remarked
but
not
with
her
usual
correctness
of
tone
then
before
i
could
attempt
an
answer
to
the
implied
sarcasm
a
proud
light
came
into
her
eyes
and
with
a
gracious
bend
of
her
fine
figure
she
met
my
look
with
one
equally
as
frank
and
cheerfully
declared
you
shall
come
early
in
the
morning
in
another
moment
she
had
vanished
inside
and
closed
the
door
i
was
defeated
for
the
nonce
or
else
she
was
all
she
appeared
to
be
and
i
a
dreaming
fool
xiv
espionage
as
i
moved
slowly
away
into
the
night
the
question
thus
raised
in
my
own
mind
assumed
greater
and
more
vital
consequence
was
she
a
true
woman
or
what
my
fears
pictured
her
the
scheming
unprincipled
abductor
of
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
she
looked
true
sometimes
acted
so
but
i
had
heard
and
seen
what
would
rouse
any
man
suspicions
and
though
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
say
carew
this
was
not
your
first
visit
to
that
scene
of
old
tragedy
you
have
been
there
before
and
with
gwendolen
in
your
arms
i
was
morally
certain
that
this
was
so
that
ocumpaugh
most
trusted
friend
was
responsible
for
the
disappearance
of
her
child
and
i
was
not
quite
sure
that
the
child
was
not
now
under
her
very
roof
it
was
very
late
by
this
time
but
i
meant
if
possible
to
settle
some
of
these
doubts
before
i
left
the
neighborhood
of
the
cottage
how
by
getting
a
glimpse
of
carew
with
her
mask
off
in
the
company
of
the
child
if
i
could
compass
it
if
not
then
entirely
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
plans
and
subtleties
it
was
an
act
more
in
line
with
my
partner
talents
than
my
own
but
i
could
not
afford
to
let
this
deter
me
i
had
had
my
chance
with
her
face
to
face
for
hours
i
had
been
in
her
company
i
had
seen
her
in
various
stages
of
emotion
sometimes
real
and
sometimes
assumed
but
at
no
moment
had
i
been
sure
of
her
possibly
because
at
no
moment
had
she
been
sure
of
me
in
our
first
visit
to
the
bungalow
in
her
own
little
library
during
the
reading
of
that
engrossing
tale
by
which
she
had
so
evidently
attempted
to
lull
my
suspicions
awakened
by
her
one
irrepressible
show
of
alarm
on
the
scene
of
gwendolen
disappearance
and
afterward
when
she
saw
that
they
might
be
so
lulled
but
not
dispelled
in
the
cellar
and
above
all
in
that
room
where
we
had
come
across
the
signs
of
gwendolen
presence
which
even
she
could
not
disavow
she
had
felt
my
eyes
upon
her
and
made
me
conscious
that
she
had
so
felt
them
now
she
must
believe
them
removed
and
if
i
could
but
gain
the
glimpse
i
speak
of
i
should
see
this
woman
as
she
was
i
thought
i
could
manage
this
i
had
listened
to
the
maid
steps
as
she
returned
up
stairs
and
i
believed
i
knew
in
what
direction
they
had
tended
after
she
reached
the
floor
above
i
would
just
see
if
one
of
the
windows
on
the
south
side
was
lighted
and
if
so
if
it
was
in
any
way
accessible
to
make
my
way
through
the
shrubbery
without
rousing
the
attention
of
any
one
inside
or
out
required
a
circumspection
that
tried
me
greatly
but
by
dint
of
strong
i
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
i
sought
without
attracting
attention
or
causing
a
single
window
to
fly
up
this
reassured
me
and
perceiving
a
square
of
light
in
the
dark
mass
of
wall
before
me
i
peered
about
among
the
trees
overlooking
this
part
of
the
building
for
one
i
could
climb
without
too
much
difficulty
the
one
which
looked
most
feasible
was
a
maple
with
branches
and
throwing
off
my
coat
i
was
soon
to
its
top
and
on
a
level
or
nearly
so
with
the
window
on
which
i
had
fixed
my
eye
there
were
no
curtains
to
this
window
the
house
being
half
dismantled
in
anticipation
of
carew
departure
but
it
was
still
protected
by
a
shade
and
this
was
drawn
down
nearly
to
the
ledge
but
not
quite
a
narrow
space
intervened
which
to
an
eye
placed
where
mine
was
offered
a
of
more
or
less
satisfactory
proportions
and
this
space
i
soon
saw
widened
perceptibly
from
time
to
time
as
the
wind
caught
at
the
shade
and
blew
it
in
with
utmost
caution
i
shifted
my
position
till
i
could
bring
my
eye
fairly
in
line
with
the
interior
of
this
room
and
finding
that
the
glimpse
given
revealed
little
but
a
blue
wall
and
some
snowy
linen
i
waited
for
the
breeze
to
blow
that
i
might
see
more
it
came
speedily
and
in
a
gust
which
lifted
the
shade
and
thus
disclosed
the
whole
inside
of
the
room
it
was
an
instantaneous
glimpse
but
in
that
moment
the
picture
projected
upon
my
eye
satisfied
me
that
despite
my
doubts
despite
my
causes
for
suspicion
i
had
been
doing
this
woman
the
greatest
injustice
in
supposing
that
her
relations
to
the
child
she
had
brought
into
her
home
were
other
than
she
had
made
out
she
had
come
up
as
she
had
promised
and
had
seated
herself
on
the
bed
with
her
face
turned
toward
the
window
i
could
thus
catch
its
whole
expression
an
expression
this
time
involuntary
and
natural
as
the
feelings
which
prompted
it
the
child
with
his
toy
clutched
in
one
hand
knelt
on
the
coverlet
with
his
head
pressed
against
her
breast
saying
his
prayers
i
could
hear
his
soft
murmur
though
i
could
not
catch
the
words
but
sweet
as
was
the
sight
of
his
little
form
burying
its
head
with
its
mass
of
dusky
curls
against
the
breast
in
which
he
most
confided
it
was
not
this
alone
which
gave
to
the
moment
its
almost
sacred
character
it
was
the
rapturous
look
with
which
carew
gazed
down
on
this
little
head
the
which
admits
of
nothing
false
and
which
when
once
seen
on
a
woman
face
whether
she
be
mother
in
fact
or
mother
only
in
heart
idealizes
her
in
the
mind
for
ever
eloquent
with
love
and
holy
devotion
the
scene
flashed
upon
my
eyes
for
a
moment
and
was
gone
but
that
moment
made
its
impression
and
settled
for
good
and
all
the
question
with
which
i
had
started
upon
this
adventure
she
the
true
woman
and
i
was
the
dreaming
fool
as
i
realized
this
i
also
realized
that
three
days
out
of
the
seven
were
gone
xv
a
phantasm
i
certainly
had
every
right
to
conclude
that
this
would
end
my
adventures
for
the
day
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
destined
to
have
yet
another
experience
before
returning
to
my
home
in
new
york
the
weather
had
changed
during
the
last
hour
and
at
the
moment
i
emerged
from
the
shadows
of
the
into
the
open
space
fronting
the
ocumpaugh
dock
a
gleam
of
lightning
shot
across
the
west
and
by
it
i
saw
what
looked
like
the
dusky
figure
of
a
man
leaning
against
a
pile
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
something
in
the
immobility
maintained
by
this
figure
in
face
of
the
quick
flashes
which
from
time
to
time
lit
up
the
scene
reminded
me
of
the
presence
i
had
come
upon
hours
before
in
front
of
carew
house
and
moved
by
the
instinct
of
my
calling
i
took
advantage
of
the
few
minutes
yet
remaining
before
train
time
to
make
my
way
in
its
direction
cautiously
of
course
and
with
due
allowance
for
the
possible
illumination
following
those
fitful
bursts
of
light
which
brought
everything
to
view
in
one
moment
only
to
plunge
it
all
back
into
the
profoundest
obscurity
the
next
i
had
two
motives
for
my
proceeding
one
as
i
say
sprang
from
the
natural
instinct
of
investigation
the
other
was
kindlier
and
less
personal
i
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
posture
which
this
person
had
now
assumed
nor
did
i
like
it
why
should
this
man
why
should
any
man
stand
like
this
at
the
dead
of
night
staring
into
waters
which
if
they
had
their
tale
to
tell
had
not
yet
told
it
unless
his
interest
in
the
story
he
read
there
was
linked
with
emotions
such
as
it
was
my
business
to
know
for
those
most
openly
concerned
in
gwendolen
loss
the
search
had
ceased
why
then
this
lone
and
lingering
watch
on
the
part
of
one
who
might
for
all
i
knew
be
some
detective
but
who
i
was
rather
inclined
to
believe
was
a
person
much
more
closely
concerned
in
the
child
fate
viz
the
next
rathbone
if
it
were
he
his
presence
there
savored
of
mystery
or
it
savored
of
the
tragic
the
latter
seemed
the
more
likely
hypothesis
judging
from
the
expression
of
his
face
as
seen
by
me
under
the
lantern
it
behooved
me
then
to
approach
him
but
to
approach
him
in
the
shadow
of
the
what
passed
in
the
next
few
minutes
seemed
to
me
unreal
and
dreamlike
i
was
tired
i
suppose
and
so
more
than
usually
susceptible
night
had
no
unfamiliar
effects
for
me
even
night
on
the
borders
of
this
great
river
nor
was
my
occupation
a
new
one
or
the
expectation
i
felt
as
fearful
and
absorbing
as
that
with
which
an
hour
or
two
before
i
had
raised
my
lantern
in
that
room
in
which
the
doleful
mystery
of
half
a
century
back
trenched
upon
the
still
more
moving
mystery
of
yet
that
experience
had
the
sharpness
of
fact
while
this
had
only
the
vagueness
of
a
phantasm
i
was
very
near
him
but
the
lightning
had
ceased
to
flash
and
i
found
it
impossible
to
discern
whether
or
not
the
form
i
had
come
there
to
identify
yet
lingered
in
its
old
position
against
the
pile
i
therefore
awaited
the
next
gleam
with
great
anxiety
an
anxiety
only
partly
alleviated
by
the
certainty
i
felt
of
hearing
the
faint
scarcely
recognizable
sound
of
his
breathing
had
the
storm
passed
over
would
no
more
flashes
come
ah
he
is
moving
that
is
a
sigh
i
hear
no
detective
exclamation
of
impatience
but
a
sufferer
sigh
of
depression
or
remorse
what
was
in
the
man
mind
a
steamboat
or
some
equally
brilliantly
illuminated
craft
was
passing
far
out
in
the
channel
the
shimmer
of
its
lights
gave
sudden
cheer
to
the
distant
prospect
the
churning
of
its
paddles
suggested
life
and
action
and
irresistibly
drew
my
eyes
that
way
would
his
follow
would
i
find
his
attitude
changed
ah
the
long
delayed
flash
has
come
and
gone
he
is
standing
there
yet
but
no
longer
in
an
attitude
of
contemplation
on
the
contrary
he
is
bending
over
the
waters
searching
with
eager
aspect
where
so
many
had
searched
before
him
and
in
the
instant
as
his
face
and
form
leaped
into
sight
i
beheld
his
clenched
right
hand
fall
on
his
breast
and
heard
on
his
lips
the
one
word
guilty
xvi
an
beauty
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
procure
and
read
a
new
york
paper
next
morning
would
i
discover
in
the
columns
any
hint
of
the
preceding
events
in
yonkers
which
if
known
must
for
ever
upset
the
wagon
theory
no
that
secret
was
still
my
secret
only
shared
by
the
doctor
who
so
far
as
i
understood
him
had
no
intention
of
breaking
his
silence
till
his
fears
of
some
disaster
to
the
little
one
had
received
confirmation
i
had
therefore
several
hours
before
me
yet
for
free
work
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
hunt
up
miss
graham
she
met
me
with
eagerness
an
eagerness
i
found
it
difficult
to
dispel
with
my
disappointing
news
in
regard
to
doctor
pool
he
is
not
the
man
said
i
can
you
think
of
any
other
she
shook
her
head
her
large
gray
eyes
showing
astonishment
and
what
i
felt
bound
to
regard
as
an
honest
bewilderment
i
wish
to
mention
a
name
said
i
one
i
know
she
asked
yes
i
know
of
no
other
person
capable
of
wronging
that
child
you
are
probably
right
but
there
is
a
gentleman
one
interested
in
the
family
a
man
with
something
to
gain
rathbone
you
must
not
mention
him
in
any
such
connection
he
is
one
of
the
best
men
i
know
kind
good
and
oh
so
sensitive
a
dozen
fortunes
would
tempt
a
man
of
his
stamp
to
do
any
one
living
a
wrong
let
alone
a
little
innocent
child
i
know
but
there
are
other
temptations
greater
than
money
to
some
men
infinitely
greater
to
one
as
sensitive
as
you
say
he
is
what
if
he
loved
a
woman
what
if
his
only
hope
of
winning
her
you
must
not
think
that
of
him
she
again
interposed
nothing
could
make
a
villain
of
i
have
seen
him
too
many
times
in
circumstances
which
show
a
man
character
he
is
good
through
and
through
and
in
all
that
concerns
gwendolen
honorable
to
the
core
i
once
saw
him
save
her
life
at
the
risk
of
his
own
you
did
when
years
ago
no
lately
within
the
last
year
tell
me
the
circumstances
she
did
they
were
convincing
as
i
listened
the
phantasm
of
the
night
before
assumed
fainter
and
fainter
proportions
when
she
had
finished
i
warmly
remarked
that
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
story
of
so
heroic
an
act
and
i
was
not
that
i
ascribed
too
deep
a
significance
to
the
word
which
had
escaped
rathbone
on
the
dock
but
because
i
was
glad
to
have
my
instinctive
confidence
in
the
man
verified
by
facts
it
seemed
to
clear
the
way
before
me
ellie
said
i
it
seemed
both
natural
and
proper
to
call
her
by
that
name
now
what
explanation
would
you
give
if
under
any
circumstances
all
circumstances
are
possible
you
know
you
heard
this
gentleman
speak
of
feeling
guilty
in
connection
with
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
i
should
have
to
know
the
circumstances
was
her
quiet
answer
let
me
imagine
some
say
that
it
was
night
late
night
at
an
hour
when
the
most
hardened
amongst
us
are
in
a
peculiarly
responsive
condition
say
that
he
had
been
spending
hours
near
the
house
of
the
woman
he
had
long
loved
but
had
quite
despaired
of
winning
in
his
greatly
hampered
condition
and
with
the
fever
of
this
longing
upon
him
but
restrained
by
emotions
the
nature
of
which
we
can
not
surmise
had
now
found
his
way
down
to
the
river
to
the
spot
where
boats
have
clustered
and
men
crouched
in
the
gruesome
and
unavailing
search
we
know
of
say
that
he
hung
there
long
over
the
water
gazing
down
in
silence
in
solitude
alone
as
he
thought
with
his
own
conscience
and
the
suggestions
offered
by
that
running
stream
where
some
still
think
despite
facts
despite
all
the
probabilities
that
gwendolen
has
found
rest
and
when
his
heart
was
full
should
be
seen
to
strike
his
breast
and
utter
with
a
quick
turn
of
his
face
up
the
hill
this
one
word
what
would
i
think
this
that
being
overwrought
by
the
struggle
you
mention
a
struggle
we
can
possibly
understand
when
we
consider
the
unavoidable
consciousness
which
must
be
his
of
the
great
change
which
would
be
effected
in
all
his
prospects
if
gwendolen
should
not
be
found
he
gave
the
name
of
guilt
to
feelings
which
some
would
call
simply
human
ellie
you
are
an
oracle
this
thought
of
hers
had
been
my
thought
ever
since
i
had
had
time
really
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
i
wonder
if
you
will
have
an
equally
wise
reply
to
give
to
my
next
question
i
can
not
say
i
speak
from
intuition
i
am
not
really
wise
intuition
is
above
wisdom
does
your
intuition
tell
you
that
carew
is
the
true
friend
she
professes
to
be
to
mrs
ocumpaugh
ah
that
is
a
different
thing
the
clear
brow
i
loved
there
how
words
escape
a
man
lost
its
smoothness
and
her
eyes
took
on
a
troubled
aspect
while
her
words
came
slowly
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
that
offhand
sometimes
i
have
felt
that
her
very
soul
was
knit
to
that
of
ocumpaugh
and
again
i
have
had
my
doubts
but
never
deep
ones
never
any
such
as
would
make
it
easy
for
me
to
answer
the
question
you
have
just
put
me
was
her
love
for
gwendolen
sincere
i
asked
oh
yes
oh
yes
that
is
i
always
thought
so
and
with
no
qualification
till
something
in
her
conduct
when
she
first
heard
of
gwendolen
disappearance
i
can
not
describe
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
disappointment
she
was
shocked
of
course
and
she
was
grieved
but
not
hopelessly
so
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
manner
we
all
felt
it
ocumpaugh
felt
it
and
let
her
dear
friend
go
the
moment
she
showed
the
slightest
inclination
to
do
so
there
were
excuses
for
carew
just
at
that
time
said
i
you
forget
the
new
interest
which
had
come
into
her
life
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
preoccupied
with
thoughts
of
her
little
nephew
replied
miss
graham
true
true
but
she
had
been
so
fond
of
gwendolen
you
would
have
thought
but
why
all
this
talk
about
carew
you
do
believe
you
surely
can
not
believe
that
carew
is
a
charming
woman
oh
yes
but
i
do
rathbone
shows
good
taste
ah
is
she
the
one
did
you
not
know
it
no
yet
i
have
seen
them
together
many
times
now
i
understand
much
that
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
me
he
never
pressed
his
suit
he
loved
but
never
harassed
her
oh
he
is
a
good
man
this
with
emphasis
is
she
a
good
woman
miss
graham
eyes
suddenly
fell
then
rose
again
until
they
met
mine
fully
and
frankly
i
have
no
reason
said
she
to
believe
her
otherwise
i
have
never
seen
anything
in
her
to
hinder
my
esteem
only
finish
that
she
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
many
less
gifted
women
do
perhaps
i
am
secretly
jealous
of
the
extreme
fondness
gwendolen
has
always
shown
for
her
if
so
the
fault
is
in
me
not
in
her
what
i
said
in
reply
is
not
germane
to
this
story
after
being
assured
by
a
few
more
discreet
inquiries
in
some
other
perfectly
safe
quarters
that
miss
graham
opinion
of
rathbone
was
shared
by
those
who
best
knew
him
i
returned
to
the
one
spot
most
likely
to
afford
me
a
clue
to
if
no
explanation
of
this
elusive
mystery
what
did
i
propose
to
myself
first
to
revisit
carew
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
boy
harry
i
no
longer
doubted
his
being
just
what
she
called
him
but
she
had
asked
me
to
call
for
this
purpose
and
i
had
no
excuse
for
declining
the
invitation
even
if
i
had
desired
to
do
so
afterward
but
first
let
us
finish
with
carew
as
she
entered
her
that
morning
she
looked
so
bright
that
is
with
the
instinctive
brightness
of
a
naturally
vivacious
temperament
that
i
wondered
if
i
had
been
mistaken
in
my
thought
that
she
had
had
no
sleep
all
that
night
simply
because
many
of
the
lights
in
her
house
had
not
been
put
out
till
morning
but
an
inspection
of
her
face
revealed
lines
of
care
which
only
her
smile
could
efface
and
she
was
not
quite
ready
for
smiles
affable
and
gracious
as
she
showed
herself
her
first
words
just
as
i
expected
were
there
is
nothing
in
the
papers
about
the
child
in
the
wagon
no
everything
does
not
get
into
the
papers
will
what
we
saw
and
what
we
found
in
the
bungalow
last
night
i
hardly
think
so
that
is
our
own
special
clue
carew
if
it
is
a
clue
you
seem
to
regard
it
as
such
with
a
shrug
i
declared
that
we
had
come
upon
a
mystery
of
some
kind
but
the
child
is
not
dead
that
you
feel
demonstrated
or
do
you
as
i
said
last
night
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
ah
is
that
the
little
boy
yes
she
gaily
responded
as
the
glad
step
of
a
child
was
heard
descending
the
stairs
harry
come
here
harry
she
cried
with
that
joyous
accent
which
a
child
presence
seems
to
call
out
in
some
women
here
is
a
gentleman
who
would
like
to
shake
hands
with
you
a
sprite
of
a
child
entered
a
perfect
sunbeam
irradiating
the
whole
room
if
under
the
confidence
induced
by
the
vision
i
had
had
of
him
on
his
knees
the
night
before
any
suspicion
remained
in
my
mind
of
his
being
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
in
disguise
it
vanished
at
sight
of
the
fearless
head
lifted
high
in
boyish
freedom
and
the
gay
swish
swish
of
the
whip
in
his
nervous
little
hand
harry
is
playing
horse
he
cried
galloping
toward
me
in
what
he
evidently
considered
true
jockey
style
i
made
a
gesture
and
stopped
him
how
do
you
do
little
man
what
did
you
say
your
name
is
harry
this
very
stoutly
harry
what
harry
carew
no
harry
just
harry
and
how
do
you
like
it
here
i
like
it
i
like
it
better
than
my
old
home
where
was
your
old
home
i
do
know
i
did
like
it
he
was
with
uncongenial
people
and
he
is
very
sensitive
put
in
carew
softly
i
like
it
here
he
repeated
and
i
like
the
big
ocean
i
am
going
on
the
ocean
and
i
like
horses
get
up
dandy
and
he
cracked
his
whip
and
was
off
again
on
his
imaginary
trot
i
felt
very
foolish
over
the
doubts
i
had
so
openly
evinced
this
was
not
only
a
boy
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
but
he
was
as
any
eye
could
see
the
near
relative
she
called
him
in
my
embarrassment
i
rose
at
all
events
i
soon
found
myself
standing
near
the
door
with
carew
a
fine
fellow
i
enthusiastically
exclaimed
and
startlingly
like
you
in
expression
he
is
your
nephew
i
believe
yes
she
replied
somewhat
wistfully
i
thought
i
felt
that
i
should
apologize
for
well
perhaps
for
the
change
she
must
have
discerned
in
my
manner
the
likeness
caused
me
a
shock
i
was
not
prepared
for
it
i
suppose
she
looked
at
me
quite
wonderingly
i
have
never
heard
any
one
speak
of
it
before
i
am
glad
that
you
see
it
and
she
seemed
glad
very
glad
but
i
know
that
for
some
reason
she
was
gladder
yet
when
i
turned
to
depart
however
she
did
not
hasten
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
she
inquired
as
she
courteously
led
the
way
through
the
piles
of
boxes
and
baskets
the
number
of
which
had
rather
grown
than
diminished
since
my
visit
the
evening
before
pardon
my
asking
resort
to
my
last
means
said
i
see
and
talk
with
mrs
ocumpaugh
an
instant
of
hesitation
on
her
part
so
short
however
that
i
could
hardly
detect
it
then
she
declared
but
you
can
not
do
that
why
not
she
is
ill
i
am
sure
that
they
will
let
no
one
approach
her
one
of
her
maids
was
in
this
morning
she
did
not
even
ask
me
to
come
over
i
am
sorry
said
i
but
i
shall
make
the
effort
the
illness
which
affects
ocumpaugh
can
be
best
cured
by
the
restoration
of
her
child
but
you
have
not
found
gwendolen
she
replied
no
but
i
have
discovered
footprints
on
the
dust
of
the
bungalow
floor
and
as
you
know
a
bit
of
candy
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
crushed
in
a
sleeping
child
hand
and
i
am
in
need
of
every
aid
possible
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
these
discoveries
they
may
point
the
way
to
gwendolen
present
whereabouts
and
they
may
not
but
they
shall
be
given
every
chance
whoop
get
up
get
up
broke
in
a
childish
voice
from
the
upper
landing
am
i
not
right
i
asked
always
only
i
am
sorry
for
ocumpaugh
may
i
tell
you
as
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
outer
just
how
to
approach
her
certainly
if
you
will
be
so
good
i
would
not
ask
for
miss
porter
ask
for
celia
she
is
special
maid
let
her
carry
your
message
if
you
feel
that
it
will
do
any
good
to
disturb
her
thank
you
the
recommendation
is
valuable
good
morning
carew
i
may
not
see
you
again
may
i
wish
you
a
safe
journey
certainly
are
we
not
almost
friends
why
did
i
not
make
my
bow
and
go
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
at
least
by
me
was
i
held
by
something
in
her
manner
doubtless
for
while
i
was
thus
reasoning
with
myself
she
followed
me
out
on
to
the
porch
and
with
some
remark
as
to
the
beauty
of
the
morning
led
me
to
an
opening
in
the
vines
whence
a
fine
view
could
be
caught
of
the
river
but
it
was
not
for
the
view
she
had
brought
me
there
this
was
evident
enough
from
her
manner
and
soon
she
paused
in
her
observations
on
the
beauties
of
nature
and
with
a
strange
ringing
emphasis
for
which
i
was
not
altogether
prepared
remarked
with
feeling
i
may
be
making
a
mistake
i
was
always
an
unconventional
woman
but
i
think
you
ought
to
know
something
of
ocumpaugh
private
history
before
you
see
her
it
is
not
a
common
one
at
least
it
has
its
romantic
elements
and
an
acquaintance
with
some
of
its
features
is
almost
necessary
to
you
if
you
expect
to
approach
her
on
so
delicate
a
matter
with
any
hope
of
success
but
perhaps
you
are
better
informed
on
this
subject
than
i
supposed
detectives
are
a
mine
of
secret
intelligence
i
am
told
possibly
you
have
already
learned
from
some
other
source
the
story
of
her
marriage
and
homecoming
to
homewood
and
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
her
early
married
life
no
i
disclaimed
in
great
relief
and
i
have
no
doubt
with
unnecessary
vivacity
on
the
contrary
i
have
never
heard
anything
said
in
regard
to
it
would
you
like
to
men
have
not
the
curiosity
of
women
and
i
do
not
wish
to
bore
you
but
i
see
that
i
shall
not
do
that
she
exclaimed
sit
down
trevitt
i
shall
not
detain
you
long
i
have
not
much
time
myself
as
she
sank
into
a
chair
in
saying
this
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
follow
her
example
i
took
pains
however
to
choose
one
which
brought
me
into
the
shadow
of
the
vines
for
i
felt
some
embarrassment
at
this
new
turn
in
the
conversation
and
was
conscious
that
i
should
have
more
or
less
difficulty
in
hiding
my
only
too
intense
interest
in
all
that
concerned
the
lady
of
whom
we
were
speaking
ocumpaugh
was
a
western
woman
carew
began
softly
the
oldest
of
five
daughters
there
was
not
much
money
in
the
family
but
she
had
beauty
a
commanding
beauty
not
the
beauty
you
see
in
her
but
that
exquisite
persuasive
loveliness
which
seizes
upon
the
imagination
as
well
as
moves
the
heart
i
have
a
picture
of
her
at
eighteen
but
never
mind
that
was
it
affection
for
her
friend
which
made
carew
always
rich
voice
so
very
mellow
i
wished
i
knew
but
i
was
successful
i
think
in
keeping
that
wish
out
of
my
face
and
preserving
my
manner
of
the
simply
polite
listener
ocumpaugh
was
on
a
hunting
trip
she
proceeded
after
a
slight
glance
my
way
he
had
traveled
the
world
over
and
seen
beautiful
women
everywhere
but
there
was
something
in
marion
allison
which
he
had
found
in
no
other
and
at
the
end
of
their
first
interview
he
determined
to
make
her
his
wife
a
man
of
impulses
but
also
a
man
of
steady
resolution
trevitt
perhaps
you
know
this
i
bowed
a
strong
man
i
remarked
and
a
romantic
one
he
had
this
intention
from
the
first
as
i
have
said
but
he
wished
to
make
himself
sure
of
her
heart
he
knew
how
his
advantages
counted
how
hard
it
is
for
a
woman
to
disassociate
the
man
from
his
belongings
and
having
a
spirit
of
some
daring
he
resolved
that
this
of
the
west
so
i
have
heard
him
call
her
should
marry
the
man
and
not
his
money
was
he
as
wealthy
then
as
now
almost
possibly
he
was
not
quite
such
a
power
in
the
financial
world
but
he
had
homewood
in
almost
as
beautiful
a
condition
as
now
though
the
new
house
was
not
put
up
till
after
his
marriage
he
courted
her
not
as
the
landscape
painter
of
tennyson
poem
but
as
a
rising
young
business
man
who
had
made
his
way
sufficiently
to
give
her
a
good
home
this
home
he
did
not
have
to
describe
since
her
own
imagination
immediately
pictured
it
as
much
below
the
one
she
lived
in
as
he
was
years
younger
than
her
hardworked
father
delighted
with
this
naïveté
he
took
pains
not
to
disabuse
her
mind
of
the
simple
prospects
with
which
she
was
evidently
so
well
satisfied
and
succeeded
in
marrying
her
and
bringing
her
as
far
as
our
station
below
there
without
her
having
the
least
suspicion
of
the
splendor
she
was
destined
for
and
now
trevitt
picture
if
you
can
the
scene
of
that
first
arrival
i
have
heard
it
described
by
him
and
i
have
heard
it
described
by
her
he
was
dressed
plainly
so
was
she
and
lest
the
surprise
should
come
before
the
proper
moment
he
had
brought
her
on
a
train
little
patronized
by
his
friends
the
sumptuousness
of
the
solitary
equipage
standing
at
the
depot
platform
must
in
consequence
have
struck
her
all
the
more
forcibly
and
when
he
turned
and
asked
her
if
she
did
not
admire
this
fine
you
can
imagine
the
lovely
smile
with
which
she
acknowledged
its
splendor
and
then
turned
away
to
look
up
and
down
for
the
she
expected
to
take
with
him
to
their
bridal
home
he
says
that
he
caught
her
back
with
the
remark
that
he
was
glad
she
liked
it
because
it
was
hers
and
many
more
like
it
but
she
insists
that
he
did
not
say
a
word
only
smiled
in
a
way
to
make
her
see
for
whom
the
carriage
door
was
being
held
open
such
was
her
entrance
into
wealth
and
love
and
alas
into
trouble
for
the
latter
followed
hard
upon
the
two
first
ocumpaugh
mother
who
had
held
sway
at
homewood
for
thirty
years
or
more
was
hard
as
the
nether
millstone
she
was
a
rathbone
and
had
brought
both
wealth
and
aristocratic
connections
into
the
family
she
had
no
sympathy
for
penniless
beauties
she
was
a
very
plain
woman
herself
and
made
those
first
few
years
of
her
life
as
nearly
miserable
as
any
woman
can
be
who
adores
her
husband
i
have
heard
that
it
was
a
common
experience
for
this
old
lady
to
taunt
her
with
the
fact
that
she
brought
nothing
into
the
family
but
herself
not
even
a
and
when
two
years
passed
and
no
child
came
the
biting
criticisms
became
so
frequent
that
a
cloud
fell
over
the
young
wife
sensitive
beauty
which
no
after
happiness
has
ever
succeeded
in
fully
dispelling
matters
went
better
after
gwendolen
came
but
in
reckoning
up
the
possible
defects
in
ocumpaugh
character
you
should
never
forget
the
twist
that
may
have
been
given
to
it
by
that
i
have
heard
of
madam
ocumpaugh
i
remarked
rising
anxious
to
end
an
interview
whose
purport
was
more
or
less
enigmatic
to
me
she
is
dead
now
happily
a
woman
like
that
is
accountable
for
much
more
than
she
herself
ever
realizes
but
one
thing
she
never
succeeded
in
doing
she
never
shook
ocumpaugh
love
for
his
wife
or
hers
for
him
whether
it
was
the
result
of
that
early
romantic
episode
of
which
i
have
spoken
or
whether
their
natures
are
peculiarly
congenial
the
bond
between
them
has
been
one
of
exceptional
strength
and
purity
it
will
be
their
comfort
now
i
remarked
carew
smiled
but
in
a
dubious
way
that
added
to
my
perplexity
and
made
me
question
more
seriously
than
ever
just
what
her
motive
had
been
in
subjecting
me
to
these
very
intimate
reminiscences
of
one
i
was
about
to
approach
on
an
errand
of
whose
purport
she
could
have
only
a
general
idea
had
she
read
my
inmost
soul
did
she
wish
to
save
her
friend
or
save
herself
or
even
to
save
me
from
the
result
of
a
blind
use
of
such
tools
as
were
the
only
ones
afforded
me
impossible
to
determine
she
was
at
this
present
moment
as
she
had
always
been
in
fact
an
unsolvable
problem
to
me
and
it
was
not
at
this
hurried
time
and
with
such
serious
work
before
me
that
i
could
venture
to
make
any
attempt
to
understand
her
you
will
let
me
know
the
outcome
of
your
talk
with
mrs
ocumpaugh
she
cried
as
i
moved
to
the
front
of
the
porch
it
was
for
me
to
look
dubious
now
i
could
make
no
such
promise
as
that
i
will
let
you
know
the
instant
there
is
any
good
news
i
assured
her
and
with
that
i
moved
off
but
not
before
hearing
the
peremptory
command
with
which
she
entered
the
house
now
dinah
quick
evidently
her
preparations
for
departure
were
to
be
pushed
xvii
in
the
green
boudoir
so
far
in
this
narrative
i
have
kept
from
the
reader
nothing
but
an
old
experience
of
which
i
was
now
to
make
use
this
experience
involved
ocumpaugh
and
was
the
cause
of
the
confidence
which
i
had
felt
from
the
first
in
my
ability
to
carry
this
search
through
to
a
successful
termination
i
believed
that
in
some
secret
but
as
yet
undiscovered
way
it
offered
a
key
to
this
tragedy
and
i
still
believed
this
little
as
i
had
hitherto
accomplished
and
blind
as
the
way
continued
to
look
before
me
nevertheless
it
was
with
anything
but
a
cheerful
heart
that
i
advanced
that
morning
through
the
shrubbery
toward
the
ocumpaugh
mansion
i
dreaded
the
interview
i
had
determined
to
seek
i
was
young
far
too
young
to
grapple
with
the
difficulties
it
involved
yet
i
saw
no
way
of
avoiding
it
or
of
saving
either
ocumpaugh
or
myself
from
the
suffering
it
involved
carew
had
advised
that
i
should
first
see
the
girl
called
celia
but
carew
knew
nothing
of
the
real
situation
i
did
not
wish
to
see
any
girl
i
felt
that
no
such
intermediary
would
answer
in
a
case
like
this
nor
did
i
choose
to
trust
miss
porter
yet
to
miss
porter
alone
could
i
appeal
the
sight
of
a
doctor
gig
standing
at
the
side
door
gave
me
my
first
shock
ocumpaugh
was
ill
then
really
ill
yet
if
i
came
to
make
her
better
i
stood
irresolute
till
i
saw
the
doctor
come
out
then
i
walked
boldly
up
and
asked
for
miss
porter
just
what
carew
had
advised
me
not
to
do
miss
porter
came
she
recognized
me
but
only
to
express
her
sorrow
that
ocumpaugh
was
totally
unfit
to
see
any
one
not
if
he
brings
news
news
i
have
news
but
of
a
delicate
nature
i
should
like
the
privilege
of
imparting
the
same
to
ocumpaugh
herself
impossible
excuse
me
if
i
urge
it
she
can
not
see
you
the
doctor
who
has
just
gone
says
that
at
all
hazards
she
must
be
kept
quiet
wo
atwater
do
is
it
is
it
good
news
that
ocumpaugh
alone
can
say
see
atwater
i
will
call
him
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
but
let
me
advise
you
leave
it
to
ocumpaugh
take
this
paper
up
to
her
it
is
only
a
sketch
and
inform
her
that
the
person
who
drew
it
has
something
of
importance
to
say
either
to
her
or
to
atwater
and
let
her
decide
which
it
shall
be
you
may
if
you
wish
mention
my
name
i
do
not
understand
you
hold
my
credentials
i
said
and
smiled
she
glanced
at
the
paper
i
had
placed
in
her
hand
it
was
a
folded
one
fastened
something
like
an
envelope
i
can
not
conceive
she
began
i
did
not
scruple
to
interrupt
her
ocumpaugh
has
a
right
to
the
privilege
of
seeing
what
i
have
sketched
there
i
said
with
what
impressiveness
i
could
though
my
heart
was
heavy
with
doubt
will
you
believe
that
what
i
ask
is
for
the
best
and
take
this
envelope
to
her
it
may
mean
the
ultimate
restoration
of
her
child
this
paper
yes
miss
porter
she
did
not
try
to
hide
her
incredulity
i
do
not
see
how
a
picture
yet
you
seem
very
much
in
earnest
and
i
know
she
has
confidence
in
you
she
and
ocumpaugh
too
i
will
take
it
to
her
if
you
can
assure
me
that
good
will
come
of
it
and
no
more
false
hopes
to
destroy
the
little
courage
she
has
left
i
can
not
promise
that
i
believe
that
she
will
wish
to
receive
me
and
hear
all
i
have
to
say
after
seeing
what
that
envelope
contains
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
honestly
go
it
does
not
satisfy
me
if
it
were
not
for
the
nearness
of
ocumpaugh
return
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
must
hear
at
sandy
hook
that
some
definite
news
has
been
received
of
his
child
you
are
right
miss
porter
he
must
he
idolized
gwendolen
he
is
a
man
of
strong
feelings
very
passionate
and
much
given
to
follow
the
impulse
of
the
moment
if
his
suspense
is
not
ended
at
the
earliest
possible
instant
the
results
may
be
such
as
i
dare
not
contemplate
i
know
it
that
is
why
i
have
pushed
matters
to
this
point
you
will
carry
that
up
to
her
yes
and
if
no
ifs
lay
it
before
her
where
she
sits
and
come
away
but
not
beyond
call
you
are
a
good
woman
i
see
it
in
your
face
do
not
watch
her
as
she
unfolds
this
paper
persons
of
her
temperament
do
not
like
to
have
their
emotions
observed
and
this
will
cause
her
emotion
that
can
not
be
helped
miss
porter
sincerely
and
honestly
i
tell
you
that
it
is
impossible
for
her
best
friends
to
keep
her
from
suffering
now
they
can
only
strive
to
keep
that
suffering
from
becoming
permanent
it
is
a
hard
task
you
have
set
me
complained
the
poor
woman
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
anything
must
be
better
for
ocumpaugh
than
the
suspense
she
is
now
laboring
under
remember
i
enjoined
with
the
full
force
of
my
secret
anxiety
that
no
eye
but
hers
must
fall
upon
this
drawing
not
that
it
would
convey
meaning
to
anybody
but
herself
but
because
it
is
her
affair
and
her
affair
only
and
you
are
the
woman
to
respect
another
person
affairs
she
gave
me
a
final
scrutinizing
look
and
left
the
room
god
grant
that
i
have
made
no
mistake
was
the
inward
prayer
with
which
i
saw
her
depart
my
fervency
was
sincere
i
was
myself
frightened
at
what
i
had
done
and
what
had
i
done
sent
her
a
sketch
drawn
by
myself
of
doctor
pool
and
of
his
office
if
it
recalled
to
her
as
i
felt
it
must
the
remembrance
of
a
certain
memorable
visit
she
had
once
paid
there
she
would
receive
me
when
miss
porter
reëntered
some
fifteen
minutes
later
i
saw
that
my
hazardous
attempt
had
been
successful
come
said
she
but
with
no
cheerful
alacrity
rather
with
an
air
of
gloom
was
was
ocumpaugh
very
much
disturbed
by
what
she
saw
i
fear
so
she
was
when
i
went
in
dreaming
as
it
seemed
and
pleasantly
it
was
cruel
to
disturb
her
indeed
i
had
not
the
heart
so
i
just
laid
the
folded
paper
near
her
hand
and
waited
but
not
too
near
not
within
sight
of
her
face
a
few
minutes
later
interminable
minutes
to
me
i
heard
the
paper
rattle
but
i
did
not
move
i
was
where
she
could
see
me
so
she
knew
that
she
was
not
alone
and
presently
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
strange
noise
from
her
lips
then
a
low
cry
then
the
quick
inquiry
in
sharper
and
more
peremptory
tones
than
i
had
ever
before
heard
from
her
did
this
come
from
who
has
dared
to
send
me
this
i
advanced
quickly
i
told
her
about
you
and
your
desire
to
see
her
how
you
had
asked
me
to
bring
her
up
this
little
sketch
so
that
she
would
know
that
you
had
real
business
with
her
that
i
regretted
troubling
her
when
she
felt
so
weak
but
that
you
promised
revelations
or
some
such
thing
at
which
i
thought
she
grew
very
pale
are
you
quite
convinced
that
you
have
news
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
the
expectations
you
have
raised
in
her
let
me
see
her
i
prayed
she
made
a
sign
and
we
both
left
the
room
ocumpaugh
awaited
me
in
her
own
boudoir
on
the
second
floor
as
we
went
up
the
main
staircase
i
was
afforded
short
glimpses
of
room
after
room
of
varying
richness
and
beauty
among
them
one
so
dainty
and
delicate
in
its
coloring
that
i
presumed
to
ask
if
it
were
that
of
the
missing
child
miss
porter
look
as
she
shook
her
head
roused
my
curiosity
i
should
be
glad
to
see
her
room
i
said
she
stopped
seemed
to
consider
the
matter
for
a
moment
then
advanced
quickly
and
beckoning
me
to
follow
led
me
to
a
certain
door
which
she
quietly
opened
one
look
and
my
astonishment
became
apparent
the
room
before
me
while
large
and
sunny
was
as
simple
i
had
almost
said
as
bare
as
my
sister
at
home
no
luxurious
furnishings
here
no
draperies
of
silk
and
damask
no
drawing
richness
from
stained
glass
no
gleam
of
silver
or
sparkle
of
glass
on
bedecked
dresser
or
carved
mantel
not
even
the
tinted
muslins
i
had
seen
in
some
nurseries
but
a
plain
set
of
furniture
on
a
plain
carpet
with
but
one
object
of
real
adornment
within
the
four
walls
that
was
a
picture
of
the
madonna
opposite
the
bed
and
that
was
beautiful
but
the
frame
was
of
the
cheapest
a
simple
band
of
oak
catching
miss
porter
eye
as
we
quietly
withdrew
i
ventured
to
ask
whose
taste
this
was
the
answer
was
short
and
had
a
decided
ring
of
disapproval
in
it
her
mother
ocumpaugh
believes
in
simple
surroundings
for
children
yet
she
dressed
gwendolen
like
a
princess
yes
for
the
world
eye
but
in
her
own
room
she
wore
gingham
aprons
which
effectually
covered
up
her
ribbons
and
laces
the
motive
for
all
this
was
in
a
way
evident
to
me
but
somehow
what
i
had
just
seen
did
not
add
to
my
courage
for
the
coming
interview
we
stopped
at
the
remotest
door
of
this
long
hall
as
miss
porter
opened
it
i
summoned
up
all
my
nerve
and
the
next
moment
found
myself
standing
in
the
presence
of
the
imposing
figure
of
ocumpaugh
drawn
up
in
the
embrasure
of
a
large
window
overlooking
the
hudson
it
was
the
same
window
doubtless
in
which
she
had
stood
for
two
nights
and
a
day
watching
for
some
sign
from
the
boats
engaged
in
dragging
the
her
back
was
to
me
and
she
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
break
away
from
her
fixed
attitude
for
several
minutes
elapsed
before
she
turned
slowly
about
and
showed
me
her
face
when
she
did
i
stood
appalled
not
a
vestige
of
color
was
to
be
seen
on
cheek
lip
or
brow
she
was
the
beautiful
ocumpaugh
still
but
the
heart
which
had
sent
the
hues
of
life
to
her
features
was
beating
slow
slow
and
the
effect
was
heartbreaking
to
one
who
had
seen
her
in
her
prime
and
the
full
glory
of
her
beauty
as
wife
and
mother
pardon
i
faltered
out
bowing
my
head
as
if
before
some
powerful
rebuke
though
her
lips
were
silent
and
her
eyes
pleading
rather
than
accusing
truly
i
had
ventured
far
in
daring
to
recall
to
this
woman
an
hour
which
at
this
miserable
time
she
probably
would
give
her
very
life
to
forget
pardon
i
repeated
with
even
a
more
humble
intonation
than
before
for
she
did
not
speak
and
i
hardly
knew
how
to
begin
the
conversation
still
she
said
nothing
and
at
last
i
found
myself
forced
to
break
the
unbearable
silence
by
some
definite
remark
i
have
presumed
i
therefore
continued
advancing
but
a
step
toward
her
who
made
no
advance
at
all
to
send
you
a
hurried
sketch
of
one
who
says
he
knows
you
that
you
might
be
sure
i
was
not
one
of
the
many
eager
but
irresponsible
men
who
offer
help
in
your
great
trouble
without
understanding
your
history
or
that
of
the
little
one
to
whose
seemingly
unaccountable
disappearance
all
are
seeking
a
clue
my
history
the
words
seemed
forced
from
her
but
no
change
in
eye
or
look
accompanied
them
nor
could
i
catch
a
motion
of
her
lips
when
she
presently
added
in
a
tone
inexpressibly
affecting
history
did
he
bid
you
say
that
doctor
pool
he
has
given
me
no
commands
other
than
to
find
the
child
i
am
not
here
as
an
agent
of
his
i
am
here
in
ocumpaugh
interest
and
your
own
with
some
knowledge
a
little
more
knowledge
than
others
have
perhaps
to
aid
me
in
the
business
of
recovering
this
child
madam
the
police
are
seeking
her
in
the
holes
and
slums
of
the
great
city
and
at
the
hands
of
desperate
characters
who
make
a
living
out
of
the
terrors
and
griefs
of
the
rich
but
this
is
not
where
i
should
look
for
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
i
should
look
nearer
just
as
you
have
looked
nearer
and
i
should
use
means
which
i
am
sure
have
not
commended
themselves
to
the
police
these
means
you
can
doubtless
put
in
my
hands
a
mother
knows
many
things
in
connection
with
her
child
which
she
neither
thinks
to
impart
nor
would
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
give
up
especially
to
a
stranger
i
am
not
a
stranger
you
have
seen
me
in
ocumpaugh
confidence
will
you
then
pardon
me
if
i
ask
what
may
strike
you
as
impertinent
questions
but
which
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
motive
if
not
to
the
method
of
the
little
one
abduction
i
do
not
understand
she
was
trying
to
shake
off
her
apathy
i
feel
confused
sick
almost
like
one
dying
how
can
i
help
have
i
done
everything
i
believe
that
she
strayed
to
the
river
and
was
drowned
i
still
believe
her
dead
otherwise
we
should
have
news
real
news
and
we
do
we
do
the
intensity
with
which
she
uttered
the
last
two
words
brought
a
line
of
red
into
her
gasping
lips
she
was
becoming
human
and
for
a
minute
i
could
not
help
drawing
a
comparison
between
her
and
her
friend
carew
as
the
latter
had
just
appeared
to
me
in
her
little
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
both
beautiful
but
owing
their
charms
to
quite
different
sources
i
surveyed
this
woman
white
against
the
pale
green
of
the
curtain
before
which
she
stood
and
imperceptibly
but
surely
the
glowing
attractions
of
the
widow
who
had
found
a
child
to
love
faded
before
the
cold
loveliness
of
this
bereaved
mother
wan
with
suffering
and
alive
with
terrors
of
whose
depth
i
could
judge
from
the
clutch
with
which
she
still
held
my
little
sketch
meanwhile
i
had
attempted
some
kind
of
answer
to
appeal
we
do
not
hear
because
she
was
not
taken
from
you
simply
for
the
money
her
return
would
bring
indeed
after
hours
of
action
and
considerable
thinking
i
am
beginning
to
doubt
if
she
was
taken
for
money
at
all
can
you
not
think
of
some
other
motive
do
you
not
know
of
some
one
who
wanted
the
child
from
let
us
say
love
did
her
lips
frame
it
or
did
i
see
it
in
her
eyes
certainly
i
heard
no
sound
yet
i
was
conscious
that
she
repeated
the
word
in
her
mind
if
not
aloud
i
know
i
have
startled
you
i
pursued
but
pardon
me
i
can
not
help
my
presumption
i
must
be
personal
i
must
even
go
so
far
as
to
probe
the
wound
i
have
made
you
have
a
claim
to
gwendolen
not
to
be
doubted
not
to
be
gainsaid
but
is
there
some
one
else
who
is
conscious
of
possessing
certain
claims
also
i
do
not
allude
to
mr
ocumpaugh
you
mean
some
relative
aunt
cousin
she
was
fully
human
now
and
very
keenly
alert
rathbone
perhaps
no
ocumpaugh
none
of
these
then
as
the
paper
rattled
in
her
hand
and
i
saw
her
eyes
fall
in
terror
on
it
i
said
as
calmly
and
respectfully
as
i
could
you
have
a
secret
ocumpaugh
that
secret
i
share
the
paper
trembled
from
her
clasp
and
fell
fluttering
downward
i
pointed
at
it
and
waited
till
our
eyes
met
possibly
that
i
might
give
her
some
encouragement
from
my
look
if
not
from
my
words
i
was
a
boy
in
doctor
pool
employ
some
five
years
ago
and
one
day
i
paused
she
had
made
me
a
supplicating
gesture
shall
i
not
go
on
i
finally
asked
give
me
a
minute
was
her
low
entreaty
o
god
o
god
that
i
should
have
thought
myself
secure
all
these
years
with
two
in
the
world
knowing
my
fatal
secret
i
learned
it
by
accident
i
went
on
when
i
saw
her
eye
turn
again
on
mine
on
a
certain
night
six
years
ago
i
was
in
the
office
behind
an
old
curtain
you
remember
the
curtain
hanging
at
the
left
of
the
doctor
table
over
that
break
in
the
i
had
no
business
there
i
had
been
meddling
with
things
which
did
not
belong
to
me
and
when
i
heard
the
doctor
step
at
the
door
was
glad
to
shrink
into
this
refuge
and
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
it
did
not
come
very
soon
first
he
had
one
patient
then
another
the
last
one
was
you
i
heard
your
name
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
your
face
as
you
went
out
it
was
a
very
interesting
story
you
told
him
i
was
touched
by
it
though
i
hardly
understood
oh
oh
she
was
swaying
from
side
to
side
swaying
so
heavily
that
i
instinctively
pushed
forward
a
chair
sit
i
prayed
you
are
not
strong
enough
for
this
excitement
she
glanced
at
me
vaguely
shook
her
head
but
made
no
move
toward
accepting
the
proffered
chair
she
submitted
however
when
i
continued
to
press
it
upon
her
and
i
felt
less
a
brute
and
monster
when
i
saw
her
sitting
with
folded
hands
before
me
i
bring
this
up
said
i
that
you
may
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
some
one
else
another
woman
in
fact
may
feel
her
claim
upon
this
child
greater
than
yours
you
mean
the
real
mother
is
she
known
the
doctor
swore
i
do
not
know
the
real
mother
i
only
know
that
you
are
not
that
to
win
some
toleration
from
your
to
make
sure
of
your
husband
lasting
love
you
won
the
doctor
over
to
a
deception
which
secured
a
seeming
heir
to
the
ocumpaughs
whose
child
was
given
you
is
doubtless
known
to
you
no
no
i
stared
aghast
what
you
do
not
know
no
i
did
not
wish
to
nor
was
she
ever
to
know
me
or
my
name
then
this
hope
has
also
failed
i
thought
that
in
this
mother
we
might
find
the
child
abductor
xviii
you
look
as
if
as
if
i
had
studiously
avoided
looking
at
her
while
these
last
few
words
passed
between
us
but
as
the
silence
which
followed
this
final
outburst
continued
i
felt
forced
to
glance
her
way
if
only
to
see
what
my
next
move
should
be
i
found
her
gazing
straight
at
me
with
a
bright
spot
on
either
cheek
looking
as
if
seared
there
by
a
iron
you
are
a
detective
she
said
as
our
regards
met
you
have
known
this
shameful
secret
always
yet
have
met
my
husband
constantly
and
have
never
told
no
i
saw
no
reason
did
you
never
when
you
saw
how
completely
my
husband
was
deceived
how
fortunes
were
bequeathed
to
gwendolen
gifts
lavished
on
her
her
small
self
made
almost
an
idol
of
because
all
our
friends
all
our
relatives
saw
in
her
a
true
ocumpaugh
think
it
wicked
to
hold
your
peace
and
let
this
all
go
on
as
if
she
were
the
actual
offspring
of
my
husband
and
myself
no
i
may
have
wondered
at
your
happiness
i
may
have
thought
of
the
consequences
if
ever
he
found
out
but
i
dared
not
go
on
the
quick
the
agonizing
nerve
of
her
grief
and
suffering
had
been
touched
and
i
myself
quailed
at
the
result
stammering
some
excuse
i
waited
for
her
soundless
anguish
to
subside
then
when
i
thought
she
could
listen
completed
my
sentence
by
saying
i
did
not
allow
my
thoughts
to
stray
quite
so
far
ocumpaugh
not
till
my
knowledge
of
your
secret
promised
to
be
of
use
did
i
let
it
rise
to
any
proportion
in
my
mind
i
had
too
much
sympathy
for
your
difficulties
i
have
this
hint
of
comfort
perhaps
from
the
only
source
which
could
afford
her
any
seemed
to
move
her
do
you
mean
that
you
are
my
friend
she
cried
that
you
would
help
me
if
any
help
were
possible
to
keep
my
secret
and
my
love
i
did
not
know
how
to
dash
the
first
spark
of
hope
i
had
seen
in
her
from
the
beginning
of
this
more
than
painful
interview
to
avoid
it
i
temporized
a
trifle
and
answered
with
ready
earnestness
i
would
do
much
ocumpaugh
to
make
the
consequences
of
your
act
as
ineffective
as
possible
and
still
be
true
to
the
interests
of
ocumpaugh
if
the
child
can
be
found
you
wish
that
you
loved
her
o
yes
i
loved
her
there
was
no
mistaking
the
wistfulness
of
her
tone
too
well
far
too
well
only
my
husband
more
if
you
can
find
her
that
is
the
first
thing
is
it
yes
it
was
a
faint
rejoinder
i
looked
at
her
again
do
not
wish
her
i
suddenly
declared
she
started
rose
to
her
feet
then
suddenly
sat
again
as
if
she
felt
that
she
could
not
stand
what
makes
you
say
that
how
dare
you
how
can
you
say
that
my
husband
loves
her
i
love
her
she
is
our
own
child
if
not
by
birth
by
every
tie
which
endears
a
child
to
a
parent
has
that
wicked
man
doctor
pool
i
put
in
for
she
stopped
gasping
yes
doctor
pool
whom
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
seen
has
he
told
you
any
such
lies
as
that
the
man
who
swore
i
put
out
my
hand
to
calm
her
i
feared
for
her
reason
if
not
for
her
life
be
careful
i
enjoined
your
walls
are
thick
but
tones
like
yours
are
penetrating
then
as
i
saw
she
would
be
answered
i
replied
to
the
question
still
alive
in
her
face
no
doctor
pool
has
not
talked
of
you
i
saw
it
in
your
own
manner
madam
it
or
something
else
perhaps
it
was
something
else
another
secret
which
i
have
not
shared
she
moistened
her
lips
and
placing
her
two
hands
on
the
knobs
of
the
chair
in
which
she
sat
leaned
passionately
forward
who
could
say
she
was
cold
now
who
could
see
anything
but
a
feeling
heart
in
this
woman
beautiful
beyond
all
precedent
in
her
passion
and
her
woe
it
is
it
was
a
secret
i
have
to
confess
to
the
abnormal
the
child
did
not
love
me
has
never
loved
me
lavish
as
i
have
been
in
my
affection
and
caresses
she
has
never
done
aught
but
endure
them
though
she
believes
me
her
own
mother
she
has
shrunk
from
me
with
all
the
might
of
her
nature
from
the
very
first
it
was
god
punishment
for
the
lie
by
which
i
strove
to
make
my
husband
believe
himself
the
father
which
in
god
providence
he
was
not
i
have
borne
it
but
my
life
has
been
a
living
hell
it
was
that
you
saw
in
my
face
nothing
else
i
was
bound
to
believe
her
the
child
had
made
her
suffer
but
she
was
bent
upon
recovering
her
of
course
i
dared
not
contemplate
any
other
alternative
her
love
for
her
husband
precluded
any
other
desire
on
her
part
and
so
i
admitted
when
after
a
momentary
survey
of
the
task
yet
before
me
i
ventured
to
remark
then
we
find
ourselves
once
more
at
the
point
from
which
we
started
where
shall
we
look
for
his
child
ocumpaugh
perhaps
it
would
aid
us
in
deciding
this
question
if
you
told
me
sincerely
told
me
why
you
had
such
strong
belief
in
gwendolen
having
been
drowned
in
the
river
you
did
believe
this
i
saw
you
at
the
window
you
are
not
an
actress
like
your
friend
you
expected
to
see
her
body
drawn
from
those
waters
for
hours
you
expected
it
though
every
one
told
you
it
was
impossible
why
she
crept
a
step
nearer
to
me
her
tones
growing
low
and
husky
do
you
see
i
i
thought
that
to
escape
me
she
might
have
leaped
into
the
water
she
was
capable
of
it
gwendolen
had
a
strong
nature
the
struggle
between
duty
and
repulsion
made
havoc
even
in
her
infantile
breast
besides
we
had
had
a
scene
that
morning
a
secret
scene
in
which
she
showed
absolute
terror
of
me
it
broke
my
heart
and
when
she
disappeared
in
that
mysterious
way
and
and
one
of
her
shoes
was
found
on
the
slope
what
was
i
to
think
but
that
she
had
chosen
to
end
her
misery
this
child
this
babe
i
had
loved
as
my
own
flesh
and
blood
in
the
river
where
she
had
been
forbidden
to
go
suicide
by
a
child
of
six
you
gave
another
reason
for
your
persistent
belief
at
the
time
mrs
ocumpaugh
was
i
to
give
this
one
no
no
one
could
expect
you
to
do
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
secret
to
preserve
and
the
child
had
been
your
own
but
the
child
did
not
go
to
the
river
you
are
convinced
of
that
now
are
you
not
yes
where
then
did
she
go
or
rather
to
what
place
was
she
taken
somewhere
near
somewhere
within
easy
reach
for
the
alarm
soon
rose
and
then
she
could
not
be
found
ocumpaugh
i
am
going
to
ask
you
an
apparently
trivial
and
inconsequent
question
was
gwendolen
very
fond
of
sweets
yes
she
was
sitting
upright
now
staring
me
in
the
face
in
unconcealed
astonishment
and
a
little
fear
what
sort
of
candy
pardon
me
if
i
seem
impertinent
had
you
in
your
house
on
the
wednesday
the
child
disappeared
any
which
she
could
have
got
at
or
the
nurse
given
her
there
were
the
confections
brought
by
the
caterer
none
other
that
i
know
of
i
did
not
indulge
her
much
in
sweets
was
there
anything
peculiar
about
these
confections
either
in
taste
or
appearance
i
did
taste
them
in
appearance
they
were
mostly
round
and
red
with
a
brandied
cherry
inside
why
sir
why
do
you
ask
what
have
these
miserable
lumps
of
sugar
to
do
with
gwendolen
madam
do
you
recognize
this
i
took
from
my
pocket
the
crushed
mass
of
colored
sugar
and
fruit
i
had
picked
up
from
the
musty
cushions
of
the
old
sofa
in
the
room
of
the
bungalow
she
took
it
and
looked
up
staring
it
is
one
of
them
she
cried
where
did
you
get
it
you
look
as
if
as
if
i
had
come
upon
a
clue
to
gwendolen
madam
i
believe
i
have
this
candy
has
been
held
in
a
hot
little
hand
miss
graham
or
one
of
the
girls
must
have
given
it
to
her
as
she
ran
through
the
or
across
the
side
veranda
on
her
way
to
the
bungalow
she
did
not
eat
it
offhand
she
evidently
fell
asleep
before
eating
it
but
she
clutched
it
very
tight
only
dropping
it
i
judge
when
her
muscles
were
quite
relaxed
by
sleep
and
then
not
far
the
folds
of
her
dress
caught
it
for
what
are
you
telling
me
the
interruption
was
sudden
imperative
i
saw
gwendolen
asleep
she
held
a
string
in
her
hand
but
no
candy
and
if
she
did
did
you
examine
both
hands
madam
think
great
issues
hang
on
a
right
settlement
of
this
fact
can
you
declare
that
she
did
not
have
this
candy
in
one
of
her
little
hands
no
i
can
not
declare
that
then
i
shall
always
believe
she
did
and
this
same
sweetmeat
this
morsel
from
the
table
set
for
your
guests
on
the
afternoon
of
the
sixteenth
of
this
month
i
found
last
night
in
the
disused
portion
of
the
bungalow
walled
up
by
ocumpaugh
father
but
made
accessible
since
by
an
opening
let
into
the
floor
from
the
cellar
this
latter
i
was
enabled
to
reach
by
means
of
a
concealed
under
the
rug
in
the
open
part
of
this
same
building
i
i
am
all
confused
say
that
again
she
pleaded
starting
once
more
to
her
feet
but
this
time
without
meeting
my
eyes
in
the
disused
part
of
the
bungalow
how
came
you
there
no
one
ever
goes
there
it
is
a
forbidden
place
the
child
has
been
there
and
lately
oh
her
fingers
began
to
tremble
and
twist
themselves
together
you
have
something
more
than
this
to
tell
me
gwendolen
has
been
found
and
her
looks
became
uncertain
and
wandered
as
i
thought
toward
the
river
she
has
not
been
found
but
the
woman
who
carried
her
into
that
place
will
soon
be
discovered
how
why
i
had
risen
by
this
time
and
could
answer
her
on
a
level
and
face
to
face
because
the
trail
of
her
steps
leads
straight
along
the
cellar
floor
we
have
but
to
measure
these
footprints
and
what
what
we
find
the
abductor
a
silence
during
which
one
long
breath
issued
from
her
lips
was
it
a
man
or
woman
steps
she
finally
asked
a
woman
daintily
shod
a
woman
of
about
the
size
of
who
why
do
you
play
with
my
anguish
because
i
hate
to
mention
the
name
of
a
friend
ah
what
do
you
know
of
my
friends
not
much
i
happened
to
meet
one
of
them
and
as
she
is
a
very
fine
woman
with
exquisitely
shod
feet
i
naturally
think
of
her
what
do
you
mean
her
hand
was
on
my
arm
her
face
close
to
mine
speak
speak
the
name
mrs
carew
i
had
purposely
refrained
up
to
this
moment
from
bringing
this
lady
even
by
a
hint
into
the
conversation
i
did
it
now
under
an
inner
protest
but
i
had
not
dared
to
leave
it
out
the
footprints
i
alluded
to
were
startlingly
like
those
left
by
her
in
other
parts
of
the
cellar
floor
besides
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
see
how
ocumpaugh
bore
this
name
notwithstanding
my
almost
completely
restored
confidence
in
its
owner
she
did
not
bear
it
well
she
flushed
and
turned
quickly
from
my
side
walking
away
to
the
window
where
she
again
took
up
her
stand
you
would
have
shown
better
taste
by
not
following
your
first
impulse
she
remarked
carew
footsteps
in
that
old
cellar
you
presume
sir
and
make
me
lose
confidence
in
your
judgment
not
at
all
carew
feet
have
been
all
over
that
cellar
floor
she
accompanied
me
through
it
last
night
at
the
time
i
found
this
crushed
bonbon
i
could
see
that
ocumpaugh
was
amazed
confounded
but
her
manner
altered
from
that
moment
tell
me
about
it
and
i
did
i
related
the
doubts
i
had
felt
concerning
the
completeness
of
the
police
investigation
as
regarded
the
bungalow
my
visit
there
at
night
with
carew
and
the
discoveries
we
had
made
then
i
alluded
again
to
the
footprints
and
the
important
clue
they
offered
but
the
child
she
interrupted
where
is
the
child
if
taken
there
why
was
she
found
there
do
you
see
that
your
conclusions
are
all
wild
incredible
a
dream
an
impossibility
i
go
by
the
signs
i
replied
there
seems
to
be
nothing
else
to
go
by
and
you
want
you
intend
to
measure
those
steps
that
is
why
i
am
here
ocumpaugh
to
request
permission
to
continue
this
investigation
and
to
ask
for
the
key
to
the
bungalow
carew
is
no
longer
available
or
rather
i
should
prefer
to
proceed
without
it
with
sudden
impulse
she
advanced
rapidly
toward
me
what
is
carew
doing
this
morning
she
asked
preparing
for
departure
she
is
quite
resolved
to
sail
do
you
wish
to
see
her
do
you
wish
her
confirmation
of
my
story
i
think
she
will
come
if
you
send
for
her
there
is
no
need
this
after
an
instant
hesitation
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
carew
and
in
you
too
she
added
with
what
she
meant
for
a
kind
look
she
was
by
nature
without
coquetry
and
this
attempt
to
please
in
the
midst
of
an
overwhelming
distress
absorbing
all
her
faculties
struck
me
as
the
most
pitiful
effort
i
had
ever
seen
my
feeling
for
her
made
it
very
hard
for
me
to
proceed
then
i
may
go
on
i
said
of
course
of
course
i
do
know
where
the
key
is
i
shall
have
to
give
orders
you
will
wait
a
few
minutes
somewhere
in
one
of
the
adjoining
rooms
while
i
look
up
mr
atwater
certainly
she
was
trembling
feverish
impatient
shall
not
look
up
atwater
for
you
i
asked
no
i
am
feeling
better
i
can
go
myself
in
another
moment
she
had
left
the
room
having
forgotten
her
own
suggestion
that
i
should
await
her
return
in
some
adjoining
apartment
xix
frenzy
five
minutes
ten
minutes
elapsed
and
i
became
greatly
impatient
i
walked
the
floor
i
stared
from
the
window
i
did
everything
i
could
think
of
to
pass
away
these
unendurable
moments
of
suspense
with
creditable
but
i
failed
utterly
as
the
clock
ticked
off
the
quarter
hour
and
then
the
half
i
grew
not
only
impatient
but
seriously
alarmed
and
flinging
down
the
book
i
had
taken
up
as
a
last
resort
stepped
from
the
room
in
the
hope
of
coming
across
some
one
in
the
hall
whom
i
could
interrogate
but
the
house
seemed
strangely
quiet
and
when
i
had
walked
the
full
length
of
the
hall
without
encountering
either
maid
or
mistress
i
summoned
up
courage
to
return
to
the
room
i
had
left
and
ring
the
bell
no
answer
though
i
waited
long
for
it
thinking
that
i
had
not
pressed
the
button
hard
enough
i
made
a
second
attempt
but
again
there
was
no
answer
was
anything
amiss
had
she
my
thought
did
not
complete
itself
in
sudden
apprehension
of
i
knew
not
what
i
dashed
from
the
room
and
made
my
way
down
stairs
without
further
ceremony
the
unnatural
stillness
which
had
attracted
my
attention
above
was
repeated
on
the
floor
below
no
one
in
the
rooms
no
one
in
the
passages
disturbed
as
i
had
not
been
yet
by
anything
which
had
occurred
in
connection
with
this
harrowing
affair
i
leaped
to
the
nearest
door
and
stepped
out
on
the
lawn
my
first
glance
was
toward
the
river
all
was
as
usual
there
with
my
worst
fears
dispelled
but
still
a
prey
to
doubts
for
which
as
yet
i
had
no
name
i
moved
toward
the
kitchen
windows
expecting
of
course
to
find
some
one
there
who
would
explain
the
situation
to
me
but
not
a
head
appeared
at
my
call
the
kitchen
too
was
deserted
this
is
not
chance
i
involuntarily
exclaimed
and
was
turning
toward
the
stables
when
i
perceived
a
child
the
son
of
one
of
the
gardeners
crossing
the
lawn
at
a
run
and
hailing
him
asked
where
everybody
had
gone
that
the
house
seemed
deserted
he
looked
back
but
kept
on
running
shouting
as
he
did
so
i
guess
they
all
down
at
the
bungalow
i
going
there
men
are
digging
up
the
cellar
ocumpaugh
says
she
afraid
miss
body
is
buried
there
aghast
and
perhaps
a
trifle
i
stood
in
the
sunshine
so
this
was
what
i
had
done
driven
her
to
frenzy
roused
her
imagination
to
such
a
point
that
she
saw
her
darling
always
her
darling
even
if
another
woman
child
lying
under
the
clay
across
which
i
had
attempted
simply
to
prove
that
she
had
been
carried
or
no
i
would
not
think
that
a
detective
of
my
experience
outwitted
by
this
stricken
woman
whom
i
had
trembled
to
see
try
to
stand
upon
her
feet
impossible
yet
the
thought
brought
the
blood
to
my
cheek
digging
up
the
bungalow
cellar
that
meant
destroying
those
footprints
before
i
had
secured
a
single
impression
of
the
same
i
should
have
roused
her
curiosity
only
not
her
terror
now
all
might
be
lost
unless
i
could
arrive
in
time
to
do
what
order
the
work
stopped
with
what
face
could
i
do
that
with
her
standing
by
in
all
the
authority
of
motherhood
frenzied
motherhood
seeking
the
possible
body
of
her
child
my
affair
certainly
looked
dubious
yet
i
started
for
the
bungalow
like
the
rest
and
on
a
run
too
perhaps
providence
would
favor
me
and
some
expedient
suggest
itself
by
which
i
might
still
save
the
clue
upon
which
so
many
hopes
hung
the
excitement
which
had
now
drawn
every
person
on
the
place
in
the
one
direction
was
at
its
height
as
i
burst
through
the
thicket
into
the
path
running
immediately
about
the
bungalow
those
who
could
get
in
at
the
door
had
done
so
filling
the
room
whence
gwendolen
had
disappeared
with
men
and
chattering
women
some
had
been
allowed
to
descend
through
the
yawning
down
which
all
were
endeavoring
to
peer
and
fortified
by
this
fact
i
armed
myself
with
an
appearance
of
authority
despite
my
sense
of
presumption
and
pushed
and
worked
my
own
way
to
these
steps
saying
that
i
had
come
to
aid
ocumpaugh
whose
attention
i
declared
i
had
been
the
first
to
direct
to
this
place
struck
with
my
manner
if
not
with
my
argument
they
yielded
to
my
importunity
and
allowed
me
to
pass
down
the
stroke
of
the
spade
and
the
harsh
voice
of
the
man
directing
the
work
greeted
my
disquieted
ears
with
a
bound
i
cleared
the
last
steps
and
alighting
on
the
cellar
bottom
was
soon
able
in
spite
of
the
to
look
about
me
and
get
some
notion
of
the
scene
a
dozen
men
were
working
the
full
corps
of
gardeners
without
doubt
and
a
single
glance
sufficed
to
show
me
that
such
of
the
surface
as
had
not
been
upturned
by
their
spades
had
been
harried
by
their
footsteps
useless
now
to
promulgate
my
carefully
formed
theory
with
any
hope
of
proof
to
substantiate
it
the
crushed
bonbon
the
boxes
and
the
freshly
sawed
hole
were
enough
without
doubt
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
child
had
been
carried
into
the
room
above
but
the
link
which
would
have
fixed
the
identity
of
the
person
so
carrying
her
was
gone
from
my
chain
of
evidence
for
ever
she
who
should
have
had
the
greatest
interest
in
establishing
this
evidence
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
miss
porter
and
directing
with
wavering
finger
and
a
wild
air
the
movements
of
the
men
who
in
a
frenzy
caught
from
her
own
dug
here
and
dug
there
as
that
inexorable
finger
pointed
sobs
choked
miss
porter
but
ocumpaugh
was
beyond
all
such
signs
of
grief
her
eyes
moved
her
breast
heaved
now
and
then
a
confused
command
left
her
lips
but
that
was
all
yet
to
me
she
was
absolutely
terrifying
and
it
took
all
the
courage
left
from
my
disappointment
for
me
to
move
so
as
to
attract
her
attention
when
i
saw
that
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
this
i
regretted
the
impulse
which
had
led
me
to
break
into
her
mood
the
change
which
my
sudden
appearance
caused
in
her
was
too
abrupt
too
startling
i
feared
the
effects
and
put
up
my
hand
in
silent
deprecation
as
her
lips
essayed
to
move
in
what
might
be
some
very
disturbing
command
if
she
heeded
it
i
can
not
say
what
she
said
was
this
it
the
child
i
looking
for
the
child
she
was
brought
here
you
proved
that
she
was
brought
here
then
why
do
we
find
her
or
or
her
little
innocent
body
i
did
not
attempt
an
answer
i
dared
not
i
merely
turned
away
into
a
corner
where
i
should
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
men
a
thought
was
rising
in
my
mind
a
thought
which
might
have
led
to
some
definite
action
if
her
voice
had
not
risen
shrilly
and
with
a
despairing
utterance
in
these
words
useless
it
is
not
here
she
will
be
found
i
was
mad
to
think
it
pull
up
your
spades
and
go
a
murmur
of
relief
from
one
end
of
the
cellar
to
the
other
and
every
spade
was
drawn
out
of
the
ground
i
could
have
told
you
ventured
one
more
hardy
than
the
rest
that
there
was
no
use
disturbing
this
old
clay
for
any
such
purpose
any
one
could
see
that
no
spade
has
been
at
work
here
before
in
years
i
said
that
i
was
mad
she
repeated
and
waved
the
men
away
slowly
they
retreated
with
clattering
spades
and
a
heavy
tread
the
murmur
which
greeted
them
above
slowly
died
out
and
the
bungalow
was
deserted
by
all
but
our
three
selves
when
quite
sure
of
this
i
turned
and
miss
porter
eyes
met
mine
with
a
reproachful
glance
easy
enough
for
me
to
understand
i
will
go
too
whispered
ocumpaugh
oh
this
has
been
like
losing
my
darling
for
the
second
time
real
grief
is
unmistakable
recognizing
the
heartfelt
tone
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
i
recurred
to
the
idea
of
frenzy
with
all
the
sympathy
her
situation
called
for
yet
i
felt
that
i
could
not
let
her
leave
before
we
had
come
to
some
understanding
but
how
express
myself
how
say
here
and
now
in
the
presence
of
a
sympathetic
but
unenlightened
third
party
what
it
would
certainly
be
difficult
enough
for
me
to
utter
to
herself
in
the
privacy
of
that
secluded
apartment
in
which
we
had
met
and
talked
before
our
confidence
was
broken
into
by
this
impetuous
act
of
hers
not
seeing
at
the
moment
any
natural
way
out
of
my
difficulties
i
stood
in
painful
confusion
conscious
of
miss
porter
eyes
and
also
conscious
that
unless
some
miracle
came
to
my
assistance
i
must
henceforth
play
but
a
sorry
figure
in
this
affair
when
my
eyes
which
had
fallen
to
the
ground
chanced
upon
a
morsel
of
paper
so
insignificant
in
size
and
of
such
doubtful
appearance
that
the
two
ladies
must
have
wondered
to
see
me
stoop
and
with
avidity
pick
it
up
and
place
it
in
my
pocket
ocumpaugh
whose
false
strength
was
fast
leaving
her
now
muttered
some
words
which
were
quite
unintelligible
to
me
though
they
caused
miss
porter
to
make
me
a
motion
very
expressive
of
a
dismissal
i
did
not
accept
it
as
such
however
without
making
one
effort
to
regain
my
advantage
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
paused
and
glanced
back
at
ocumpaugh
she
was
still
looking
my
way
but
her
chin
had
fallen
on
her
breast
and
she
seemed
to
sustain
herself
erect
only
by
a
powerful
effort
again
her
pitiable
and
humiliating
position
appealed
to
me
and
it
was
with
some
indication
of
feeling
that
i
finally
said
am
i
not
to
have
an
opportunity
of
finishing
the
conversation
so
unhappily
interrupted
ocumpaugh
i
am
not
satisfied
and
i
do
not
believe
you
can
be
with
the
partial
disclosures
i
then
made
afford
me
i
pray
a
continuation
of
that
interview
if
only
to
make
plain
to
me
your
wishes
otherwise
i
may
fall
into
some
mistake
say
or
do
something
which
i
might
regret
for
matters
can
not
stand
where
they
are
you
know
that
do
you
not
madam
adèle
go
go
this
to
miss
porter
i
must
have
a
few
words
more
with
trevitt
i
had
forgotten
what
i
owe
him
in
the
frenzy
which
possessed
me
do
you
wish
to
talk
to
him
asked
that
lady
with
very
marked
anxiety
no
no
it
is
too
cold
too
dark
i
think
i
can
walk
to
carew
will
you
join
me
there
mr
trevitt
i
bowed
but
as
she
passed
near
me
in
going
out
i
whispered
in
her
ear
i
should
suggest
that
we
hold
our
talk
anywhere
but
at
house
since
she
is
liable
to
be
the
chief
subject
of
our
conversation
now
now
more
than
ever
her
share
in
the
child
disappearance
was
not
eliminated
or
affected
in
any
way
by
the
destruction
of
her
footprints
i
will
go
back
to
the
house
i
will
see
him
in
my
own
room
ocumpaugh
suddenly
announced
to
her
greatly
disturbed
companion
trevitt
will
follow
in
a
few
minutes
i
must
have
time
to
think
to
compose
myself
to
decide
she
was
evidently
thinking
aloud
anxious
to
save
her
from
any
i
hastily
interrupted
her
saying
quietly
i
will
be
at
your
boudoir
door
in
a
from
now
i
myself
have
something
to
think
of
in
the
interim
be
careful
it
was
miss
porter
who
stopped
to
utter
this
word
in
my
ear
be
very
careful
i
entreat
her
are
strained
almost
to
breaking
i
answered
with
a
look
she
could
not
be
more
conscious
of
this
than
i
was
xx
what
do
you
know
i
was
glad
of
that
i
too
wanted
a
free
moment
in
which
to
think
and
examine
the
small
scrap
of
paper
i
had
picked
up
from
this
cellar
floor
in
the
casual
glance
i
had
given
it
it
had
seemed
to
offer
me
a
fresh
clue
quite
capable
of
replacing
the
old
one
and
i
did
not
change
my
mind
on
a
second
examination
the
shape
the
hue
the
few
words
written
on
it
even
the
musty
smell
pervading
it
all
going
to
prove
it
to
be
the
one
possible
link
which
could
reunite
the
chain
whose
continuity
i
had
believed
to
be
gone
for
ever
rejoicing
in
my
good
luck
yet
conscious
of
still
moving
in
very
troubled
waters
i
cast
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
carew
house
from
the
door
of
the
bungalow
whence
i
had
seen
ocumpaugh
depart
and
asked
myself
why
carew
of
all
persons
in
the
vicinity
had
been
the
only
one
to
hang
back
from
this
scene
of
excitement
it
was
not
like
her
to
hide
herself
at
such
a
crisis
how
invariably
she
had
followed
me
in
each
and
every
visit
i
had
paid
here
and
though
i
remembered
all
her
reasons
for
preoccupation
her
absence
under
the
present
conditions
bore
an
aspect
of
guilt
which
sent
my
mind
working
in
a
direction
which
was
not
entirely
new
to
me
but
which
i
had
not
as
yet
resolutely
faced
guilt
the
word
recalled
that
other
and
similar
one
uttered
by
rathbone
in
that
adventure
which
had
impressed
me
as
so
unreal
and
still
held
its
place
in
my
mind
as
something
i
had
dreamed
he
was
looking
up
when
he
said
it
up
the
hill
up
toward
house
he
had
struck
his
own
breast
but
he
had
looked
up
not
down
and
though
i
had
naturally
associated
the
word
he
had
used
with
himself
and
miss
graham
with
a
womanly
intuition
had
supplied
me
with
an
explanation
of
the
same
which
was
neither
nor
unnatural
yet
all
through
this
day
of
startling
vicissitudes
and
unimaginable
interviews
faint
doubts
bidden
and
unbidden
had
visited
my
mind
which
at
this
moment
culminated
in
what
i
might
call
the
irresistible
question
as
to
whether
he
might
not
have
had
in
mind
some
one
nearer
and
dearer
than
himself
when
he
uttered
that
accusing
word
her
position
as
i
saw
it
now
did
not
make
this
supposition
too
monstrous
for
belief
that
is
if
she
secretly
loved
this
man
who
did
not
dare
or
was
too
burdened
with
responsibility
to
woo
her
and
who
can
penetrate
a
woman
mind
to
give
him
possibly
without
his
knowledge
what
every
one
who
knew
him
declared
him
to
stand
in
special
need
of
money
and
relief
from
too
exacting
work
might
have
seemed
motive
enough
to
one
of
her
warm
and
impulsive
temperament
for
eliminating
the
child
she
cared
for
but
not
as
she
cared
for
him
it
was
hard
to
think
it
it
would
be
harder
yet
to
act
upon
it
but
the
longer
i
stood
there
brooding
the
more
i
felt
my
conviction
grow
that
from
her
and
from
her
alone
we
should
yet
obtain
definite
traces
of
the
missing
child
if
only
ocumpaugh
would
uphold
me
in
the
attempt
but
would
ocumpaugh
do
this
i
own
that
i
had
my
doubts
some
hidden
cause
or
instinct
which
i
had
not
been
able
to
reach
though
i
had
plunged
deep
into
the
most
galling
secrets
of
her
life
seemed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
full
acceptance
of
the
injury
i
believed
her
to
have
received
from
carew
or
rather
in
the
way
of
her
public
acknowledgment
of
it
though
she
would
fain
have
this
upturning
of
the
bungalow
cellar
pass
for
an
act
of
frenzy
i
could
not
quite
bring
myself
to
look
upon
it
as
such
since
taking
a
final
observation
of
its
condition
though
her
professed
purpose
had
been
to
seek
the
body
of
her
child
the
spades
had
not
gone
deeper
than
their
length
it
had
been
harrowing
not
digging
she
had
ordered
and
harrowing
meant
nothing
more
than
an
obliteration
of
the
footprints
which
i
had
menaced
her
with
comparing
with
those
of
carew
why
this
show
of
consideration
to
one
she
might
call
friend
but
who
could
hold
no
comparison
in
her
mind
with
the
safely
or
recovery
of
the
child
which
if
not
hers
was
the
beloved
object
of
her
husband
heart
and
only
too
deeply
cherished
by
herself
did
she
fear
her
charming
neighbor
was
the
bond
between
them
founded
on
something
besides
love
and
did
she
apprehend
that
a
discovery
of
carew
connection
with
gwendolen
disappearance
would
only
precipitate
her
own
disgrace
and
open
up
to
public
recognition
the
false
relationship
she
held
toward
the
little
heiress
hard
questions
these
but
ones
which
must
soon
be
faced
and
answered
for
wretched
as
was
ocumpaugh
position
and
truly
as
i
sympathized
with
her
misery
i
was
none
the
less
resolved
to
force
such
acknowledgments
from
her
as
would
allow
me
to
approach
carew
with
a
definite
accusation
such
as
even
that
daring
spirit
could
not
withstand
thus
resolved
and
resisting
all
temptation
to
hazard
an
interview
with
the
latter
lady
before
i
had
seen
ocumpaugh
again
i
made
my
way
up
slowly
through
the
grounds
and
entered
by
the
side
door
just
as
my
watch
told
me
that
the
of
my
waiting
was
over
miss
porter
was
in
the
upper
hall
but
turned
aside
at
my
approach
with
a
meaning
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
boudoir
i
thought
that
her
eyes
looked
red
certainly
she
was
trembling
very
much
and
with
this
poor
preparation
for
an
interview
before
which
the
strongest
and
most
experienced
man
might
quail
i
advanced
for
the
second
time
that
morning
to
the
door
behind
which
the
distracted
mother
awaited
me
if
i
knocked
i
do
not
remember
it
i
rather
think
she
opened
the
door
for
me
herself
upon
hearing
my
step
in
the
hall
at
all
events
we
were
soon
standing
again
face
to
face
and
the
battle
of
our
two
wills
for
it
would
be
nothing
less
now
had
begun
she
was
the
first
to
speak
braving
my
inquiring
look
with
eyes
in
whose
depths
determination
struggled
with
growing
despair
she
asked
me
peremptorily
almost
wildly
have
you
told
any
one
do
you
mean
to
publish
my
shame
to
the
world
i
see
decision
in
your
face
does
it
mean
that
tell
me
does
it
mean
that
no
madam
far
be
it
from
me
to
harbor
such
an
intention
unless
driven
to
it
by
the
greatest
necessity
your
secret
is
your
own
my
only
reason
for
betraying
my
knowledge
of
it
was
the
hope
i
cherished
of
its
affording
us
some
clue
to
the
identity
of
gwendolen
abductor
it
has
not
done
so
yet
may
never
do
so
then
let
us
leave
that
topic
and
return
to
the
clue
offered
by
the
carrying
of
that
child
into
the
room
back
of
the
bungalow
ocumpaugh
intentionally
or
unintentionally
the
proof
upon
which
i
relied
for
settling
the
identity
of
the
person
so
carrying
her
has
been
destroyed
with
a
flush
which
her
seemingly
bloodless
condition
made
perfectly
startling
she
drew
back
breaking
into
wild
disclaimers
i
know
i
fear
i
was
too
wild
too
eager
i
thought
only
of
what
might
lie
under
that
floor
in
a
of
earth
madam
the
spades
did
not
enter
any
deeper
with
a
sudden
access
of
courage
born
possibly
of
her
despair
she
sought
neither
to
attempt
denial
nor
palliate
the
fact
and
if
this
was
my
intention
though
i
do
acknowledge
it
you
must
recognize
my
reason
i
do
not
believe
you
can
not
make
me
believe
that
gwendolen
was
carried
into
that
room
by
carew
but
i
could
see
that
you
believed
it
and
to
save
her
the
shame
of
such
an
accusation
and
all
that
might
follow
from
it
i
oh
trevitt
you
do
not
think
this
possible
do
you
know
so
little
of
the
impulses
of
a
mind
bewildered
as
mine
has
been
by
intolerable
suffering
i
can
understand
madness
and
i
am
willing
to
think
that
you
were
mad
just
then
especially
as
no
harm
has
been
done
and
i
can
still
accuse
carew
of
a
visit
to
that
room
with
the
proof
in
my
hand
what
do
you
mean
the
steady
voice
was
faltering
but
i
could
not
say
with
what
emotion
hope
for
herself
doubt
of
me
fear
for
her
friend
it
might
have
been
any
of
these
it
might
have
been
all
was
there
a
footprint
left
then
you
say
proof
do
you
mean
proof
a
detective
does
not
use
that
word
lightly
you
may
be
sure
that
i
would
not
i
returned
then
in
answer
to
the
appeal
of
her
whole
attitude
and
expression
no
there
were
no
footprints
left
but
i
came
upon
something
else
which
i
have
sufficient
temerity
to
believe
will
answer
the
same
purpose
remember
that
my
object
is
first
to
convince
you
and
afterward
carew
that
it
will
be
useless
for
her
to
deny
that
she
has
been
in
that
room
once
that
is
understood
the
rest
will
come
easy
for
we
know
the
child
was
there
and
it
is
not
a
place
she
could
have
found
alone
the
proof
she
had
no
strength
for
more
than
that
the
proof
trevitt
the
proof
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
then
drew
it
out
again
empty
making
haste
however
to
say
ocumpaugh
i
do
not
want
to
distress
you
but
i
must
ask
you
a
few
questions
first
do
you
know
the
secret
of
that
strangely
divided
room
only
in
a
general
way
ocumpaugh
has
never
told
me
you
have
not
seen
the
written
account
of
it
no
nor
given
into
carew
hand
such
an
account
no
carew
duplicity
was
assuming
definite
proportions
yet
there
is
such
an
account
and
i
have
listened
to
a
reading
of
it
you
yes
madam
carew
read
it
to
me
last
night
in
her
own
house
she
told
me
it
came
to
her
from
your
hands
you
see
she
is
not
always
particular
in
her
statements
a
lift
of
the
hand
whether
in
deprecation
or
appeal
i
could
not
say
was
all
the
answer
this
received
i
saw
that
i
must
speak
with
the
utmost
directness
this
account
was
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
on
several
sheets
of
paper
these
sheets
were
very
old
and
were
torn
as
well
as
discolored
i
had
them
in
my
hand
and
noticed
that
a
piece
was
lacking
from
one
of
them
ocumpaugh
are
you
ready
to
repeat
that
carew
did
not
receive
this
old
letter
from
you
or
obtain
it
in
any
way
you
know
of
from
the
house
we
are
now
in
i
had
rather
not
be
forced
to
contradict
carew
was
the
low
reply
but
in
justice
to
you
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
hear
of
this
letter
for
the
first
time
god
grant
but
what
can
any
old
letter
have
to
do
with
the
agonizing
question
before
us
i
am
not
strong
trevitt
i
am
suffering
do
not
confuse
and
burden
me
i
pray
pardon
i
am
not
saying
one
unnecessary
word
these
old
sheets
a
secret
from
the
family
did
not
come
from
this
house
whence
then
did
they
come
into
carew
possession
i
see
you
have
forestalled
my
answer
and
if
you
will
now
glance
at
this
end
of
paper
picked
up
by
me
in
your
presence
from
the
cellar
floor
across
which
we
both
know
that
her
footsteps
have
passed
you
will
see
that
it
is
a
proof
capable
of
convicting
her
of
the
fact
i
held
out
the
scrap
i
now
took
from
my
pocket
ocumpaugh
hand
refused
to
take
it
or
her
eyes
to
consult
it
nevertheless
i
still
held
it
out
pray
read
the
few
words
you
will
find
there
i
urged
they
are
in
explanation
of
the
document
itself
but
they
will
serve
to
convince
you
that
the
letter
to
which
they
were
attached
and
which
is
now
in
carew
hands
came
from
that
decaying
room
no
no
the
gesture
which
accompanied
this
exclamation
was
more
than
one
of
refusal
it
was
that
of
repulse
i
can
not
see
i
do
not
need
to
i
am
convinced
pardon
me
but
that
is
not
enough
ocumpaugh
i
want
you
to
be
certain
let
me
read
these
words
the
story
they
prefaced
is
unknown
to
you
let
it
remain
so
all
i
need
to
tell
you
about
it
is
this
that
it
was
written
by
ocumpaugh
father
he
who
raised
this
partition
and
who
is
the
undoubted
author
of
these
lines
remember
that
they
headed
the
letter
with
the
room
whose
ceiling
oozes
blood
if
in
time
to
come
any
man
reads
these
lines
he
will
know
why
i
pulled
down
the
encircling
wall
built
by
my
father
and
why
i
raised
a
new
one
across
this
end
of
the
pavilion
ocumpaugh
eyes
opened
wide
in
horror
blood
she
repeated
a
ceiling
oozing
blood
an
old
superstition
ocumpaugh
quite
unworthy
your
attention
at
this
moment
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
that
portion
of
what
i
have
read
but
on
the
word
with
the
room
we
know
what
room
was
meant
there
can
be
but
one
i
have
myself
seen
the
desk
from
which
these
sheets
were
undoubtedly
taken
and
for
them
to
be
in
the
hand
of
a
certain
person
argues
ocumpaugh
hand
went
up
in
dissuasion
but
i
relentlessly
finished
that
she
has
been
in
that
room
are
you
more
than
convinced
of
this
now
are
you
sure
she
did
not
need
to
make
reply
eyes
and
attitude
spoke
for
her
but
it
was
the
look
and
attitude
of
despair
not
hope
evidently
she
had
the
very
greatest
reason
to
fear
carew
who
possibly
had
her
hard
side
as
well
as
her
charming
one
to
ease
the
situation
i
spoke
what
was
in
both
our
minds
i
see
that
you
are
sure
that
makes
my
duty
very
plain
ocumpaugh
my
next
visit
must
be
upon
mrs
carew
the
spirit
which
from
the
beginning
of
this
later
interview
had
infused
fresh
strength
into
her
feeble
frame
seemed
to
forsake
her
at
this
simple
declaration
her
whole
form
drooped
and
the
eyes
which
had
rested
on
mine
turned
in
their
old
way
to
the
river
i
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
some
one
who
knows
you
well
who
knows
the
child
well
dropped
the
wrong
shoe
into
the
river
a
murmur
nothing
more
from
ocumpaugh
set
lips
could
it
i
do
not
say
that
it
was
i
do
see
any
reason
why
it
should
be
but
could
it
have
been
mrs
carew
not
a
sound
this
time
not
a
sound
she
was
down
at
the
dock
that
night
did
you
know
it
a
gesture
but
whether
of
assent
or
dissent
i
could
not
tell
we
know
of
no
other
person
who
was
there
but
the
men
employed
what
do
you
know
with
all
her
restraint
gone
a
suffering
and
despairing
woman
ocumpaugh
was
on
her
knees
grasping
my
arm
with
both
hands
quit
this
torture
tell
me
that
you
know
it
all
and
leave
me
to
to
die
madam
i
was
confounded
and
as
i
looked
at
her
face
strained
back
in
wild
appeal
i
was
more
than
confounded
i
was
terrified
madam
what
does
this
mean
are
you
you
lock
the
door
she
cried
no
one
must
come
in
here
now
i
have
said
so
much
that
i
must
say
more
listen
and
be
my
friend
oh
be
my
friend
were
my
footsteps
you
saw
in
the
bungalow
it
was
i
who
carried
gwendolen
into
that
secret
xxi
providence
had
i
suspected
this
had
all
my
efforts
for
the
last
been
for
the
purpose
of
entrapping
her
into
some
such
avowal
i
do
not
know
my
own
feelings
at
the
time
are
a
mystery
to
me
i
blundered
on
with
a
blow
here
and
a
blow
there
till
i
hit
this
woman
in
a
vital
spot
and
achieved
the
above
mentioned
result
i
was
not
happy
when
i
reached
it
i
felt
no
elation
scarcely
any
relief
it
all
seemed
so
impossible
she
marked
the
signs
of
incredulity
in
my
face
and
spoke
up
quickly
almost
sharply
you
do
not
believe
me
i
will
prove
the
truth
of
what
i
say
wait
wait
and
running
to
a
closet
she
pulled
out
a
drawer
where
was
her
weakness
now
and
brought
from
it
a
pair
of
soiled
white
slippers
if
the
house
had
been
ransacked
she
proceeded
pantingly
these
would
have
told
their
own
tale
i
was
shocked
when
i
saw
their
condition
and
kept
my
guests
waiting
till
i
changed
them
oh
they
will
fit
the
footprints
her
smile
was
ghastly
softly
she
set
the
shoes
down
carew
helped
me
she
went
for
the
child
at
night
oh
we
are
in
a
terrible
strait
we
two
unless
you
will
stand
by
us
like
a
friend
and
you
will
do
that
wo
you
trevitt
no
one
else
knows
what
i
have
just
confessed
not
even
doctor
pool
though
he
suspects
me
in
ways
i
never
dreamed
of
money
shall
not
stand
in
the
way
i
have
a
fortune
of
my
own
now
nothing
shall
stand
in
the
way
if
you
will
have
pity
on
carew
and
myself
and
help
us
to
preserve
our
secret
madam
what
secret
i
pray
you
to
make
me
acquainted
with
the
whole
matter
in
all
its
details
before
you
ask
my
assistance
then
you
do
not
know
it
not
altogether
and
i
must
know
it
altogether
first
what
has
become
of
the
child
she
is
safe
and
happy
you
have
seen
her
you
mentioned
doing
so
just
now
harry
harry
i
rose
before
her
in
intense
excitement
what
a
plot
i
stood
aghast
at
its
daring
and
the
success
it
had
so
nearly
met
with
i
had
moments
of
suspicion
i
admitted
after
a
short
examination
of
this
beautiful
woman
face
for
the
marks
of
strength
which
her
part
in
this
plot
seemed
to
call
for
but
they
all
vanished
before
carew
seemingly
open
manner
and
the
perfect
boyishness
of
the
child
is
she
an
actress
too
gwendolen
not
when
she
plays
horse
and
indian
and
other
boyish
games
she
is
only
acting
out
her
nature
she
has
no
girl
tastes
she
is
all
boy
and
it
was
by
means
of
these
instincts
that
carew
won
her
she
promised
her
that
if
she
would
leave
home
and
go
with
her
to
europe
she
would
cut
her
hair
and
call
her
harry
and
dress
her
so
that
every
one
would
think
her
a
boy
and
she
promised
her
something
else
that
she
should
go
to
her
father
gwendolen
idolizes
mr
ocumpaugh
but
i
know
you
wonder
why
if
i
loved
my
husband
i
should
send
away
the
one
cherished
object
of
his
life
it
is
because
our
love
was
threatened
by
this
very
object
i
saw
nothing
but
death
and
chaos
before
me
if
i
kept
her
my
husband
adores
the
child
but
he
hates
and
despises
a
falsehood
and
my
secret
was
threatened
by
the
one
man
who
knows
it
your
doctor
pool
my
accomplice
once
he
declared
himself
ready
to
become
my
accuser
if
the
child
remained
under
the
ocumpaugh
roof
one
day
after
the
date
he
fixed
for
her
removal
ah
i
ejaculated
with
sudden
comprehension
of
the
full
meaning
of
the
scrawls
i
had
seen
in
so
many
parts
of
the
grounds
and
by
what
right
did
he
demand
this
what
excuse
did
he
give
you
his
wish
for
money
immense
money
old
miser
that
he
is
no
for
money
i
could
have
given
him
his
motive
is
a
less
tangible
one
he
has
scruples
he
says
religious
scruples
following
a
change
of
heart
oh
he
was
a
cruel
man
to
meet
determined
inexorable
i
could
not
move
or
influence
him
the
proffer
of
money
only
hurt
my
cause
a
fraud
had
been
perpetrated
he
said
and
ocumpaugh
must
know
it
would
i
confess
the
truth
to
him
myself
no
then
he
would
do
so
for
me
and
bring
proofs
to
substantiate
his
statements
i
thought
all
was
lost
my
husband
confidence
his
love
his
pleasure
even
in
the
child
for
it
was
his
own
blood
that
he
loved
in
her
and
her
connection
with
his
family
of
whose
prestige
he
has
an
exaggerated
idea
made
desperate
by
the
thought
i
faced
this
cruel
doctor
it
was
in
his
own
office
he
had
presumed
upon
that
old
secret
linking
us
together
to
summon
me
there
and
told
him
solemnly
that
rather
than
do
this
i
would
kill
myself
and
he
almost
bade
me
but
refrained
when
the
word
had
half
left
his
lips
and
changed
it
to
a
demand
for
the
child
immediate
removal
from
the
benefits
it
enjoyed
under
false
pretenses
and
from
this
ocumpaugh
went
on
to
relate
how
he
had
told
her
that
gwendolen
had
inherited
fortunes
because
she
was
believed
to
be
an
ocumpaugh
that
not
being
an
ocumpaugh
she
must
never
handle
those
fortunes
winding
up
with
some
such
language
as
this
manage
it
how
you
will
only
relieve
me
from
the
oppression
of
feeling
myself
a
party
to
the
grossest
of
deceptions
can
not
the
child
run
away
and
be
lost
i
am
willing
to
aid
you
in
that
even
to
paying
for
her
bringing
up
in
some
decent
respectable
way
such
as
would
probably
have
been
her
lot
if
you
had
not
interfered
to
place
her
in
the
way
of
millions
it
was
a
mad
thought
half
meant
and
apparently
wholly
impossible
to
carry
out
without
raising
suspicions
as
damaging
as
confession
itself
but
it
took
an
immediate
hold
upon
the
miserable
woman
he
addressed
though
she
gave
little
evidence
of
it
for
he
proceeded
to
add
in
a
hard
tone
that
or
immediate
confession
to
your
husband
with
me
by
to
substantiate
your
story
no
slippery
woman
tricks
will
go
down
with
me
fix
the
date
here
and
now
and
i
promise
to
stand
back
and
await
the
result
in
total
silence
dally
with
it
by
so
much
as
an
hour
and
i
am
at
your
gates
with
a
story
that
all
must
hear
is
it
a
matter
of
wonder
that
the
stricken
woman
without
counsel
and
prohibited
from
the
very
nature
of
her
secret
from
seeking
counsel
uttered
the
first
one
that
came
to
mind
and
went
home
to
brood
over
her
position
and
plan
how
she
could
satisfy
his
demands
with
the
least
cost
to
herself
her
husband
and
the
child
ocumpaugh
was
in
europe
this
was
her
one
point
of
comfort
what
was
done
could
be
done
in
his
absence
and
this
fact
greatly
minimized
any
risk
she
was
likely
to
incur
when
he
returned
he
would
find
the
house
in
mourning
for
she
had
already
decided
within
herself
that
only
by
apparent
death
could
this
child
be
safely
robbed
of
her
endowments
as
an
ocumpaugh
and
an
heiress
he
would
grieve
but
his
grief
would
lack
the
sting
of
shame
and
so
in
course
of
time
would
soften
into
a
lovely
memory
of
one
who
had
been
as
the
living
sunshine
to
him
and
like
the
sunshine
brief
in
its
shining
thus
and
thus
only
could
she
show
her
consideration
for
him
for
herself
no
consideration
was
possible
it
must
always
be
her
fate
to
know
the
child
alive
yet
absolutely
removed
from
her
this
was
a
sorrow
capable
of
no
alleviation
for
gwendolen
was
passionately
dear
to
her
all
the
dearer
perhaps
because
the
had
never
been
satisfied
because
she
had
held
the
cup
in
hand
but
had
never
been
allowed
to
drink
the
child
future
how
to
rob
her
of
all
she
possessed
yet
secure
her
happiness
and
the
prospect
of
an
honorable
estate
ah
there
was
the
difficulty
and
one
she
quite
failed
to
solve
till
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
and
despair
after
five
sleepless
nights
she
took
carew
into
her
confidence
and
implored
her
aid
the
free
resourceful
cheery
nature
of
the
woman
saw
through
the
difficulty
at
once
give
her
to
me
she
cried
i
love
little
children
passionately
and
have
always
grieved
over
my
childless
condition
i
will
take
gwendolen
raise
her
and
fill
her
little
heart
so
full
of
love
she
will
never
miss
the
magnificence
she
has
been
brought
to
look
upon
as
her
birthright
only
i
shall
have
to
leave
this
vicinity
perhaps
the
country
and
you
would
be
willing
asked
the
poor
mother
mother
by
right
of
many
years
of
service
if
not
of
blood
the
answer
broke
her
heart
though
it
was
only
a
smile
but
such
a
smile
confident
joyous
triumphant
the
smile
of
a
woman
who
has
got
her
heart
wish
while
she
she
must
henceforth
live
childless
so
that
was
settled
but
not
the
necessary
ways
and
means
of
accomplishment
those
came
only
with
time
the
two
women
had
always
been
friends
so
their
frequent
meetings
in
the
green
boudoir
did
not
waken
a
suspicion
a
sudden
trip
to
europe
was
decided
on
by
carew
and
by
degrees
the
whole
plot
perfected
in
her
eyes
it
looked
feasible
enough
and
they
both
anticipated
complete
success
having
decided
that
the
scheme
as
planned
by
them
could
be
best
carried
out
in
the
confusion
of
a
great
entertainment
cards
were
sent
out
for
the
sixteenth
the
date
agreed
upon
in
the
doctor
office
as
the
one
which
should
see
a
complete
change
in
gwendolen
prospects
it
was
also
settled
that
on
the
same
day
carew
should
bring
home
from
a
certain
small
village
in
connecticut
her
little
nephew
who
had
lately
been
left
an
orphan
there
was
no
deception
about
this
nephew
carew
had
for
some
time
supplied
his
needs
and
paid
for
his
board
in
the
where
he
had
been
left
and
in
the
emergency
which
had
just
come
up
she
took
care
to
publish
to
all
her
friends
that
she
was
going
to
bring
him
home
and
take
him
with
her
to
europe
further
a
and
woman
with
whom
carew
had
had
dealings
for
years
were
persuaded
to
call
at
her
house
shortly
after
three
that
afternoon
to
take
this
nephew
of
hers
by
a
circuitous
and
prolonged
ride
through
the
country
to
an
institution
in
which
she
had
had
him
entered
under
an
assumed
name
all
this
in
one
day
meanwhile
carew
undertook
to
open
with
her
own
hands
a
passage
from
the
cellar
of
the
bungalow
into
the
long
closed
room
behind
the
partition
this
was
to
insure
such
a
safe
retreat
for
the
child
during
the
first
search
that
by
no
possibility
could
anything
be
found
to
contradict
the
testimony
of
the
little
shoe
which
ocumpaugh
purposed
presenting
to
all
eyes
as
found
on
the
slope
leading
to
that
great
the
river
otherwise
the
child
might
have
been
passed
over
to
carew
at
once
all
this
being
decided
upon
each
waited
to
perform
the
part
assigned
her
carew
in
a
fever
of
delight
for
she
was
passionately
devoted
to
gwendolen
and
experienced
nothing
but
rapture
at
the
prospect
of
having
this
charming
child
all
to
herself
ocumpaugh
whose
only
recompense
would
be
freedom
from
a
threatening
exposure
which
would
cost
her
the
only
thing
she
prized
her
husband
love
in
a
condition
of
cold
dread
relieved
only
by
the
burning
sense
of
the
necessity
of
impressing
upon
the
whole
world
and
especially
upon
ocumpaugh
an
absolute
belief
in
the
child
death
this
was
her
first
care
to
this
her
mind
clung
with
an
agony
of
purpose
which
was
the
fittest
preparation
possible
for
real
display
of
feeling
when
the
time
came
but
she
forgot
one
thing
they
both
forgot
one
thing
that
chance
or
providence
might
ordain
that
witnesses
should
be
on
the
road
below
homewood
to
prove
that
the
child
did
not
cross
the
track
at
the
time
of
her
disappearance
to
them
it
seemed
enough
to
plead
the
child
love
for
the
water
her
desire
to
be
allowed
to
fish
the
opportunity
given
her
to
escape
and
the
little
shoes
such
in
face
of
a
great
peril
could
be
pardoned
ocumpaugh
on
the
verge
of
delirium
under
her
cold
exterior
but
carew
should
have
taken
this
possibility
into
account
and
would
have
done
so
probably
had
she
not
been
completely
absorbed
in
the
part
she
would
be
called
upon
to
play
when
the
exchange
of
children
should
be
made
and
gwendolen
be
intrusted
to
her
charge
within
a
dozen
rods
of
her
own
home
this
she
could
dwell
on
with
the
whole
force
of
her
mind
this
she
could
view
in
all
its
relations
and
make
such
a
study
of
as
to
provide
herself
against
all
contingencies
but
the
obvious
danger
of
a
gang
of
men
being
placed
just
where
they
could
serve
as
witnesses
in
contradiction
of
the
one
fact
upon
which
the
whole
plot
was
based
never
even
struck
her
imagination
the
whose
heart
was
divided
between
her
duty
to
the
child
and
her
strong
love
of
music
was
chosen
as
their
unconscious
accomplice
in
this
fraud
as
the
time
for
the
great
musicale
approached
she
was
bidden
to
amuse
gwendolen
in
the
bungalow
with
the
understanding
that
if
the
child
fell
asleep
she
might
lay
her
on
the
divan
and
so
far
leave
her
as
to
take
her
place
on
the
bench
outside
where
the
notes
of
the
solo
singers
could
reach
her
that
gwendolen
would
fall
asleep
and
fall
asleep
soon
the
wretched
mother
well
knew
for
she
had
given
her
a
safe
but
potent
sleeping
draft
which
could
not
fail
to
insure
a
twelve
hours
undisturbed
slumber
to
so
healthy
a
child
the
fact
that
the
little
one
had
shrunk
more
than
ever
from
her
attentions
that
morning
both
hurt
and
encouraged
her
certainly
it
would
make
it
easier
for
carew
to
influence
gwendolen
in
her
own
mind
filled
with
terrible
images
of
her
husband
grief
and
her
long
prospective
dissimulation
one
picture
rose
in
brilliant
contrast
to
the
dark
one
embodying
her
own
miserable
future
and
that
of
the
bereaved
father
it
was
that
of
the
perfect
joy
of
the
child
in
the
arms
of
the
woman
she
loved
best
it
brought
her
cheer
it
brought
her
anguish
it
was
a
salve
to
her
conscience
and
a
mortal
thrust
in
an
already
festering
wound
she
shut
it
from
her
eyes
as
much
as
possible
and
so
the
hour
came
we
know
its
results
how
far
the
scheme
succeeded
and
whence
its
great
failure
arose
gwendolen
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
on
reaching
the
bungalow
and
miss
graham
dreaming
no
harm
and
having
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
ocumpaugh
took
advantage
of
the
permission
she
had
received
and
slipped
outside
to
sit
on
the
bench
and
listen
to
the
music
presently
ocumpaugh
appeared
saying
that
she
had
left
her
guests
for
a
moment
just
to
take
a
look
at
gwendolen
and
see
if
all
were
well
with
her
as
she
needed
no
attendance
miss
graham
might
stay
where
she
was
and
miss
graham
did
taking
great
pleasure
in
the
music
which
was
the
finest
she
had
ever
heard
meanwhile
ocumpaugh
entered
the
bungalow
and
untying
the
child
shoes
as
she
had
frequently
done
before
when
she
found
her
asleep
she
lifted
her
and
carried
her
just
as
she
was
down
the
trap
the
door
of
which
she
had
previously
raised
the
darkness
lurking
in
such
places
a
darkness
which
had
rendered
it
so
impenetrable
at
midnight
was
relieved
to
some
extent
in
daylight
by
means
of
little
grated
openings
in
the
wall
under
the
beams
so
that
her
chief
difficulty
lay
in
holding
up
her
long
dress
and
sustaining
the
heavy
child
at
the
same
time
but
the
exigency
of
the
moment
and
her
apprehension
lest
miss
graham
should
reënter
the
bungalow
before
she
could
finish
her
task
and
escape
gave
great
precision
to
her
movements
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
she
had
reached
those
musty
precincts
which
if
they
should
not
prove
the
death
of
the
child
would
safely
shelter
her
from
every
one
eye
till
the
first
excitement
of
her
loss
was
over
and
the
conviction
of
her
death
by
drowning
became
a
settled
fact
in
every
mind
ocumpaugh
return
was
a
flight
she
had
brought
one
of
the
little
shoes
with
her
concealed
in
a
pocket
she
had
made
especially
for
it
in
the
trimmings
of
her
elaborate
gown
she
found
the
bungalow
empty
the
trap
still
raised
and
miss
graham
toward
whom
she
cast
a
hurried
look
through
the
window
yet
in
her
place
listening
with
enthralled
attention
to
the
great
tenor
upon
whose
magnificent
singing
ocumpaugh
had
relied
for
the
successful
carrying
out
of
what
she
and
carew
considered
the
most
critical
part
of
the
plot
so
far
then
all
was
well
she
had
but
to
drop
the
carefully
to
its
place
replace
the
corner
of
the
carpet
she
had
pulled
up
push
down
with
her
foot
the
two
or
three
nails
she
had
previously
loosened
and
she
would
be
quite
at
liberty
to
quit
the
place
and
return
to
her
guests
but
she
found
that
this
was
not
as
easy
as
she
had
imagined
the
clogs
of
a
terrible
almost
a
criminal
consciousness
held
back
her
steps
she
stumbled
as
she
left
the
bungalow
and
stopped
to
catch
her
breath
as
if
the
oppression
of
the
room
in
which
she
had
immured
her
darling
had
infected
the
sunny
air
of
this
glorious
day
and
made
free
breathing
an
impossibility
the
weights
on
her
feet
were
so
palpable
to
her
that
she
unconsciously
looked
down
at
them
this
was
how
she
came
to
notice
the
dust
on
her
shoes
alive
to
the
story
it
told
she
burst
the
spell
which
held
her
and
made
a
bound
toward
the
house
rushing
to
her
room
she
shook
her
skirts
and
changed
her
shoes
and
thus
freed
from
all
connecting
links
with
that
secret
spot
reëntered
among
her
guests
as
beautiful
and
probably
as
wretched
a
woman
as
the
world
contained
that
day
yet
not
as
wretched
as
she
could
be
there
were
depths
beneath
these
depths
if
he
should
ever
know
if
he
should
ever
come
to
look
at
her
with
horrified
even
alienated
eyes
ah
that
were
the
end
that
would
mean
the
river
for
her
the
river
which
all
were
so
soon
to
think
had
swallowed
the
little
gwendolen
was
that
miss
graham
coming
was
the
stir
she
now
heard
outside
the
first
indication
of
the
hue
and
cry
which
would
soon
ring
through
the
whole
place
and
her
shrinking
heart
as
well
no
no
not
yet
she
could
still
smile
must
smile
and
smite
her
two
hands
together
in
simulated
applause
of
notes
and
tones
she
did
not
even
hear
and
no
one
noted
anything
strange
in
that
smile
or
in
that
gracious
bringing
together
of
hands
which
if
any
one
had
had
the
impulse
to
touch
but
no
one
thought
of
doing
that
a
heart
may
bleed
drop
by
drop
to
its
death
in
our
full
sight
without
our
suspecting
it
if
the
eyes
above
it
still
beam
with
natural
brightness
and
hers
did
that
she
had
always
been
called
impassive
god
be
thanked
that
no
warmth
was
expected
from
her
and
that
no
one
would
suspect
the
death
she
was
dying
if
she
did
not
cry
out
but
the
moment
came
when
she
did
cry
out
miss
graham
entered
told
her
story
and
all
ocumpaugh
agony
burst
its
bounds
in
a
scream
which
to
others
seemed
but
the
natural
outburst
of
an
alarmed
mother
she
fled
to
the
bungalow
because
that
seemed
the
natural
thing
to
do
and
never
forgetting
what
was
expected
of
her
cried
aloud
in
presence
of
its
emptiness
the
river
the
river
and
went
stumbling
down
the
bank
the
shoe
was
near
her
hand
and
she
drew
it
out
as
she
went
on
when
they
found
her
she
had
fainted
the
excess
of
excitement
has
this
natural
outcome
she
did
not
have
to
play
a
part
the
humiliation
of
her
own
deed
and
the
terrors
yet
to
come
were
eating
up
her
very
soul
then
came
the
blow
the
unexpected
overwhelming
blow
of
finding
that
the
deception
planned
with
such
care
a
deception
upon
the
success
of
which
the
whole
safety
of
the
scheme
depended
was
likely
to
fail
just
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
dozen
men
could
swear
that
the
child
had
never
crossed
the
track
she
was
dazed
confounded
carew
was
not
by
to
counsel
her
she
had
her
own
part
in
this
business
to
play
and
ocumpaugh
conscious
of
being
mentally
unfit
for
any
new
planning
conscious
indeed
of
not
being
able
to
think
at
all
simply
followed
her
instinct
and
held
to
the
old
cry
in
face
of
proof
of
persuasion
of
reason
even
and
so
did
the
very
wisest
thing
possible
no
one
expecting
reason
in
a
mother
reeling
under
such
a
vital
shock
but
the
cooler
more
subtile
and
less
guilty
carew
had
some
judgment
left
if
her
friend
had
lost
hers
her
own
part
had
been
well
played
she
had
brought
her
nephew
home
without
giving
any
one
not
even
the
maid
she
had
provided
herself
with
in
new
york
an
opportunity
to
see
his
face
and
she
had
passed
him
over
dressed
in
quite
different
clothes
to
the
couple
in
the
who
had
carried
him
as
she
supposed
safely
out
of
reach
and
any
possibility
of
discovery
you
see
her
calculations
failed
here
also
she
did
not
credit
the
doctor
with
even
the
little
conscience
he
possessed
and
unconscious
of
his
near
waiting
on
the
highway
in
anxious
watch
for
the
event
concerning
which
he
had
his
own
secret
doubts
she
deluded
herself
into
thinking
that
all
they
had
to
fear
was
a
continuation
of
the
impression
that
gwendolen
had
not
gone
down
to
the
river
and
been
drowned
when
therefore
she
had
acted
out
her
little
part
received
the
searching
party
and
gone
with
them
all
over
the
house
even
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
she
said
her
little
nephew
was
resting
after
his
journey
did
they
look
in
perhaps
and
perhaps
not
it
mattered
little
for
the
bed
had
been
arranged
against
this
contingency
and
no
one
but
a
detective
bent
upon
ferreting
out
crime
would
have
found
it
empty
she
asked
herself
how
she
could
strengthen
the
situation
and
cause
the
theory
advanced
by
ocumpaugh
to
be
received
notwithstanding
the
evidence
of
seeming
the
result
was
the
throwing
of
a
second
shoe
into
the
water
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
enough
for
her
to
do
this
unseen
as
she
had
to
approach
the
river
by
her
own
grounds
and
as
she
was
obliged
to
choose
a
place
sufficiently
remote
from
the
lights
about
the
dock
not
to
incur
the
risk
of
being
detected
in
her
hazardous
attempt
the
shoe
fell
at
a
spot
farther
down
stream
than
the
searchers
had
yet
reached
and
the
intense
excitement
i
had
myself
seen
in
ocumpaugh
face
the
day
i
made
my
first
visit
to
homewood
sprang
from
the
agony
of
suspense
with
which
she
watched
after
hours
of
alternating
expectation
and
disappointment
the
finding
of
this
second
shoe
which
with
fanatic
confidence
she
hoped
would
bring
all
the
confirmation
to
be
desired
of
her
declaration
that
the
child
would
yet
be
found
in
the
river
meanwhile
to
the
infinite
dismay
of
both
the
matter
had
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
police
and
word
sent
to
ocumpaugh
not
that
the
child
was
dead
but
missing
this
meant
publicity
and
the
constant
coming
and
going
about
homewood
of
the
very
men
whose
insight
and
surveillance
were
most
to
be
dreaded
ocumpaugh
sank
under
the
terrors
thus
accumulating
upon
her
but
carew
of
different
temperament
and
history
rose
to
meet
them
with
a
courage
which
bade
fair
to
carry
everything
before
it
as
midnight
approached
the
hour
agreed
upon
in
their
compact
she
prepared
to
go
for
gwendolen
ocumpaugh
who
had
not
forgotten
what
was
expected
of
her
at
that
hour
roused
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
uttering
a
loud
cry
rushed
from
her
place
in
the
window
down
to
the
lawn
calling
out
that
she
had
heard
the
men
shout
aloud
from
the
boats
her
plan
was
to
draw
every
one
who
chanced
to
be
about
down
to
the
river
bank
in
order
to
give
carew
full
opportunity
to
go
and
come
unseen
on
her
dangerous
errand
and
she
apparently
succeeded
in
this
for
by
the
time
she
had
crept
back
in
seeming
disappointment
to
the
house
a
light
could
be
seen
burning
behind
a
pink
shade
in
one
of
carew
upper
windows
the
signal
agreed
upon
between
them
of
the
presence
of
gwendolen
in
her
new
home
but
small
was
the
relief
as
yet
the
shoe
had
not
been
found
and
at
any
moment
some
intruder
might
force
his
way
into
carew
house
and
in
spite
of
all
her
precautions
succeed
in
obtaining
a
view
of
the
little
harry
and
recognize
in
him
the
missing
child
of
these
same
precautions
some
mention
must
be
made
the
artful
widow
had
begun
by
dismissing
all
her
help
giving
as
an
excuse
her
speedy
departure
for
europe
and
the
colored
girl
she
had
brought
up
from
new
york
saw
no
difference
in
the
child
running
about
the
house
in
its
little
velvet
suit
from
the
one
who
with
face
and
a
heavy
shade
over
his
eyes
came
up
in
the
cars
with
her
in
carew
lap
her
duties
being
limited
to
a
watch
on
the
child
to
see
that
it
came
to
no
harm
she
was
the
best
witness
possible
in
case
of
police
intrusion
or
neighborhood
gossip
as
for
gwendolen
herself
the
novelty
of
the
experience
and
the
prospect
held
out
by
a
speedy
departure
to
papa
country
kept
her
amused
and
even
hilarious
she
laughed
when
her
hair
was
cut
short
darkened
and
parted
she
missed
but
one
thing
and
that
was
her
pet
plaything
which
she
used
to
carry
to
bed
with
her
at
night
the
lack
of
this
caused
some
tears
a
grief
which
was
divined
by
ocumpaugh
who
took
pains
to
assuage
it
in
the
manner
we
all
know
but
this
was
after
the
finding
of
the
second
shoe
the
event
so
long
anticipated
and
so
little
productive
somehow
neither
carew
nor
ocumpaugh
had
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
of
the
shoes
being
rights
and
lefts
and
when
this
attempt
to
second
the
first
deception
was
decided
on
it
was
thought
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
gwendolen
had
been
supplied
with
two
pairs
of
the
same
make
and
that
one
pair
yet
remained
in
her
closet
the
mate
of
that
shown
by
ocumpaugh
was
still
on
the
child
foot
in
the
bungalow
but
there
being
no
difference
in
any
of
them
what
was
simpler
than
to
take
one
of
these
and
fling
it
where
it
would
be
found
alas
the
one
seized
upon
by
carew
was
for
the
same
foot
as
that
already
shown
and
commented
on
and
thus
this
second
attempt
failed
even
more
completely
than
the
first
and
people
began
to
cry
a
conspiracy
and
a
conspiracy
it
was
but
one
which
might
yet
have
succeeded
if
doctor
pool
suspicion
of
ocumpaugh
intentions
and
my
own
secret
knowledge
of
ocumpaugh
real
position
toward
this
child
could
have
been
eliminated
from
the
situation
but
with
those
two
factors
against
them
detection
had
crept
upon
them
in
unknown
ways
and
neither
ocumpaugh
frantic
clinging
to
the
theory
she
had
so
recklessly
advanced
nor
carew
determined
effort
to
meet
suspicion
with
the
brave
front
calculated
to
disarm
it
was
of
any
avail
the
truth
would
have
its
way
and
their
secret
stood
revealed
this
was
the
story
told
me
by
ocumpaugh
not
in
the
continuous
and
detailed
manner
i
have
here
set
down
but
in
disjointed
sentences
and
wild
bursts
of
disordered
speech
when
it
was
finished
she
turned
upon
me
eyes
full
of
haggard
inquiry
our
fate
is
in
your
hands
she
falteringly
declared
what
will
you
do
with
it
it
was
the
hardest
question
which
had
ever
been
put
me
for
minutes
i
contemplated
her
in
a
silence
which
must
have
been
one
prolonged
agony
to
her
i
did
not
see
my
way
i
did
not
see
my
duty
then
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
at
last
i
replied
as
follows
ocumpaugh
if
you
will
let
me
advise
you
as
a
man
intensely
interested
in
the
happiness
of
yourself
and
husband
i
would
suggest
your
meeting
him
at
quarantine
and
telling
him
the
whole
truth
i
would
rather
die
said
she
yet
only
by
doing
what
i
suggest
can
you
find
any
peace
in
life
the
consciousness
that
others
know
your
secret
will
come
between
you
and
any
satisfaction
you
can
ever
get
out
of
your
husband
continued
confidence
a
wrong
has
been
done
you
are
the
only
one
to
right
it
i
can
not
i
can
die
but
i
can
not
do
that
and
for
a
minute
i
thought
she
would
die
then
and
there
doctor
pool
is
a
fanatic
he
will
pursue
you
until
he
is
assured
that
the
child
is
in
good
hands
you
can
assure
him
of
that
now
next
month
his
exactions
may
take
another
direction
you
can
never
trust
a
man
who
thinks
he
has
a
mission
pardon
my
presumption
no
mercenary
motive
prompts
what
i
am
saying
now
so
you
intend
to
publish
my
story
if
i
do
not
i
hesitated
again
such
questions
can
not
be
decided
in
a
moment
then
with
a
certain
consciousness
of
doing
right
i
answered
earnestly
to
no
one
but
to
ocumpaugh
do
i
feel
called
upon
to
disclose
what
really
concerns
no
one
but
yourself
and
him
her
hands
rose
toward
me
in
a
gesture
which
may
have
been
an
expression
of
gratitude
or
only
one
of
simple
appeal
he
is
not
due
until
saturday
i
added
gently
no
answer
from
the
cold
lips
i
do
not
think
she
could
have
spoken
if
she
had
tried
xxii
on
the
second
terrace
my
first
step
on
leaving
homewood
was
to
seek
a
public
telephone
calling
up
doctor
pool
in
yonkers
i
assured
him
that
he
might
rest
easy
as
to
the
young
patient
to
whose
doubtful
condition
he
had
called
my
attention
that
she
was
in
good
hands
and
was
doing
well
that
i
had
seen
her
and
would
give
him
all
necessary
particulars
when
i
came
to
interview
him
later
in
the
day
to
his
uneasy
questions
i
vouchsafed
little
reply
i
was
by
no
means
sure
of
the
advisability
of
taking
him
into
my
full
confidence
it
was
enough
for
him
to
know
that
his
demands
had
been
complied
with
without
injury
to
the
child
before
hanging
up
the
receiver
i
put
him
a
question
on
my
own
behalf
how
was
the
boy
in
his
charge
the
growl
he
returned
me
was
very
and
afforded
me
some
food
for
thought
as
i
turned
back
to
carew
cottage
where
i
now
proposed
to
make
a
final
visit
i
entered
from
the
road
the
heavily
wooded
grounds
looked
desolate
the
copper
beeches
which
are
the
glory
of
the
place
seemed
to
have
lost
color
since
i
last
saw
them
above
the
intervening
hedges
even
the
house
as
it
gradually
emerged
to
view
through
the
close
shrubbery
wore
a
different
aspect
from
usual
in
another
moment
i
saw
why
every
shutter
was
closed
and
not
a
vestige
of
life
was
visible
above
or
below
startled
for
i
had
not
expected
quite
so
hasty
a
departure
on
her
part
i
ran
about
to
the
side
door
where
i
had
previously
entered
and
rang
fit
to
wake
the
dead
only
solitary
echoes
came
from
within
and
i
was
about
to
curse
the
time
i
had
lost
in
telephoning
to
doctor
pool
when
i
heard
a
slight
sound
in
the
direction
of
the
private
path
and
leaping
hastily
to
the
opening
caught
the
glimpse
of
something
or
somebody
disappearing
down
the
first
flight
of
steps
did
i
run
you
may
believe
i
did
at
least
till
i
had
descended
the
first
terrace
then
my
steps
grew
gradually
wary
and
finally
ceased
for
i
could
hear
voices
ahead
of
me
on
the
second
terrace
to
which
i
had
now
come
and
these
voices
came
from
persons
standing
still
if
i
rushed
on
i
should
encounter
these
persons
and
this
was
undesirable
i
accordingly
paused
just
short
of
the
top
and
so
heard
what
raised
the
moment
into
one
of
tragic
importance
one
of
the
speakers
was
carew
there
was
no
doubting
this
the
other
was
rathbone
from
no
other
lips
than
his
could
i
hope
to
hear
words
uttered
with
such
intensity
though
he
was
guarded
in
his
speech
or
thought
he
was
which
is
not
always
the
same
thing
he
was
pleading
with
her
and
my
heart
stood
still
with
the
sense
of
threatening
catastrophe
as
i
realized
the
attitude
of
the
pair
he
as
every
word
showed
was
still
ignorant
of
gwendolen
fate
consequently
of
the
identity
of
the
child
who
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
was
at
that
very
moment
fluttering
a
few
steps
below
in
the
care
of
the
colored
maid
whose
voice
i
could
faintly
hear
she
with
his
passion
to
meet
and
quell
had
this
secret
to
maintain
hearing
his
wild
entreaties
with
one
ear
and
listening
for
the
possible
outbursts
of
the
child
with
the
other
mad
to
go
to
catch
her
train
before
discovery
overwhelmed
her
yet
not
daring
to
hasten
him
for
his
mood
was
a
man
mood
and
not
to
be
denied
i
felt
sorry
for
her
and
cast
about
in
my
mind
what
aid
to
give
the
situation
when
the
passion
of
his
words
seized
me
and
i
forgot
her
position
in
the
interest
i
began
to
feel
in
his
valerie
valerie
he
was
saying
this
is
cruelty
you
go
with
no
good
cause
that
i
can
see
put
the
sea
between
us
and
yet
say
no
word
to
make
the
parting
endurable
you
understand
what
i
suffer
my
hateful
thoughts
my
dread
which
is
not
so
much
dread
as
oh
that
i
should
say
it
oh
that
i
should
feel
it
hope
guilty
unpardonable
hope
yet
you
refuse
me
the
little
word
the
kindly
look
which
would
alleviate
the
oppression
of
my
feelings
and
give
me
the
thought
of
you
to
counteract
this
eternal
brooding
upon
gwendolen
and
her
possible
fate
i
want
a
promise
conditional
o
god
but
yet
a
promise
and
you
simply
bid
me
to
have
patience
to
wait
as
if
a
man
could
wait
who
sees
his
love
his
life
his
future
trembling
in
the
balance
against
the
fate
of
a
little
child
if
you
loved
me
hush
the
feeling
in
that
word
was
not
for
him
i
felt
it
at
once
it
was
for
her
secret
threatened
every
instant
she
lingered
there
by
some
move
by
some
word
which
might
escape
a
thoughtless
child
you
do
not
understand
me
justin
you
talk
with
no
comprehension
of
myself
or
of
the
event
six
months
from
now
if
all
goes
well
you
will
see
that
i
have
been
kind
not
cruel
i
can
not
say
any
more
i
should
not
have
said
so
much
go
back
dear
friend
and
let
me
take
the
train
with
harry
the
sea
is
not
impassable
we
shall
meet
again
and
then
did
she
pause
to
look
behind
her
down
those
steps
to
make
some
gesture
of
caution
to
the
uneasy
child
you
will
forgive
me
for
what
seems
cruelty
to
you
now
i
can
not
do
differently
with
all
the
world
weeping
over
the
doubtful
fate
of
this
little
child
you
can
not
expect
me
to
to
make
any
promise
conditional
upon
her
the
man
cry
drove
the
irony
of
the
situation
out
of
my
mind
puerilities
all
puerilities
a
man
life
soul
are
worth
some
sacrifices
if
you
loved
me
a
quick
ingathering
of
his
breath
then
a
low
moan
then
the
irrepressible
cry
she
vainly
sought
to
hush
o
valerie
you
are
silent
you
do
not
love
me
two
years
of
suffering
two
years
of
repression
then
this
delirium
of
hope
of
possibility
and
you
i
will
trouble
you
no
more
gwendolen
alive
or
gwendolen
dead
what
is
it
to
me
i
hush
there
is
no
doubt
on
that
topic
the
child
is
let
that
be
understood
between
us
this
was
whispered
and
whispered
very
low
but
the
air
seemed
breathless
at
that
moment
and
i
heard
her
this
is
my
last
word
to
you
you
will
have
your
fortune
whether
you
have
my
love
or
not
remember
that
and
auntie
make
dinah
move
away
i
want
to
see
the
man
you
are
talking
to
gwendolen
had
spoken
xxiii
a
coral
bead
what
that
it
was
rathbone
who
first
found
voice
to
what
a
state
have
i
come
when
in
every
woman
face
even
in
hers
who
is
dearest
i
see
expressions
i
no
longer
understand
and
in
every
child
voice
catch
the
sound
of
gwendolen
harry
voice
is
not
like
gwendolen
came
in
desperate
protest
from
the
ready
widow
a
daring
assertion
for
her
to
make
to
him
who
had
often
held
this
child
in
his
arms
for
hours
together
you
are
not
yourself
justin
i
am
sorry
i
i
almost
she
gave
her
promise
almost
she
risked
her
future
possibly
his
by
saying
under
the
stress
of
her
fears
what
her
heart
did
not
prompt
her
to
when
a
quick
move
on
her
part
a
low
cry
on
his
and
he
came
rushing
up
the
steps
i
had
advanced
at
her
hesitating
words
and
shown
myself
when
rathbone
was
well
up
the
terrace
he
hardly
honored
me
with
a
look
as
he
went
by
i
slowly
began
my
descent
to
where
she
stood
with
her
back
toward
me
and
her
arms
thrown
round
the
child
she
had
evidently
called
to
her
in
her
anxiety
to
conceal
the
little
beaming
face
from
this
new
intruder
that
she
had
not
looked
as
high
as
my
face
i
felt
assured
that
she
would
not
show
me
hers
unless
i
forced
her
to
seemed
equally
certain
every
step
i
took
downward
was
consequently
of
moment
to
me
i
wondered
how
i
should
come
out
of
this
what
she
would
do
what
i
myself
should
say
the
bold
course
commended
itself
to
me
no
more
circumlocution
no
more
doubtful
playing
of
the
game
with
this
woman
i
would
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
i
had
reached
the
step
on
which
she
crouched
i
could
catch
sight
of
the
child
eyes
over
her
shoulder
a
shoulder
that
quivered
was
it
with
the
storm
of
the
last
interview
or
with
her
fear
of
this
i
would
see
pausing
i
said
to
her
with
every
appearance
of
respect
but
in
my
most
tones
carew
may
i
request
you
to
send
gwendolen
down
to
the
girl
i
see
below
there
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
before
you
leave
with
a
start
which
showed
how
completely
she
was
taken
by
surprise
carew
rose
she
may
have
recognized
my
voice
and
she
may
not
it
is
hard
to
decide
in
such
an
actress
whether
she
did
or
not
she
turned
with
a
frown
which
gave
way
to
a
ravishing
smile
as
her
eyes
met
my
face
you
she
said
and
without
any
betrayal
in
voice
or
gesture
that
she
recognized
that
her
hopes
and
those
of
the
friend
to
whose
safety
she
had
already
sacrificed
so
much
had
just
received
their
she
gave
a
quick
order
to
the
girl
who
taking
the
child
by
the
hand
sat
down
on
the
steps
carew
now
quitted
and
laid
herself
out
to
be
amusing
gravely
carew
confronted
me
on
the
terrace
below
explain
said
she
i
have
just
come
from
ocumpaugh
i
replied
the
veiled
head
dropped
a
trifle
she
could
not
sustain
herself
so
all
is
lost
that
depends
but
i
must
request
you
not
to
leave
the
country
till
ocumpaugh
returns
the
flash
of
her
eye
startled
me
who
can
detain
me
she
cried
if
i
wish
to
go
i
did
not
answer
in
kind
i
had
no
wish
to
rouse
this
opposition
i
do
not
think
you
will
want
to
go
when
you
remember
condition
would
you
leave
her
to
bear
the
full
burden
of
this
deception
alone
she
is
a
broken
woman
her
full
story
is
known
to
me
i
have
the
profoundest
sympathy
for
her
she
has
only
three
days
in
which
to
decide
upon
her
course
i
have
advised
her
to
tell
the
whole
truth
to
her
husband
you
the
word
was
but
a
breath
but
i
heard
it
yet
i
felt
no
resentment
against
this
woman
no
one
could
under
the
spell
of
so
much
spirit
and
grace
did
i
not
advise
her
right
perhaps
but
you
must
not
detain
you
must
do
nothing
to
separate
me
from
this
child
i
will
not
bear
it
i
have
experienced
for
days
now
what
motherhood
might
be
and
nothing
on
earth
shall
rob
me
of
my
present
rights
in
this
child
then
as
she
met
my
unmoved
countenance
if
you
know
ocumpaugh
whole
history
you
know
that
neither
she
nor
her
husband
has
any
real
claim
on
the
child
in
that
you
are
mistaken
i
quickly
protested
six
years
of
care
and
affection
such
as
they
have
bestowed
on
gwendolen
to
say
nothing
of
the
substantial
form
which
these
have
taken
from
the
first
constitute
a
claim
which
all
the
world
must
recognize
if
you
do
not
think
of
ocumpaugh
belief
in
her
relation
to
him
think
of
the
shock
which
awaits
him
when
he
learns
that
she
is
not
of
his
blood
and
lineage
i
know
i
know
her
fingers
worked
nervously
the
woman
was
showing
through
the
actress
but
i
will
not
give
up
the
child
ask
anything
but
that
madam
i
have
had
the
honor
so
far
to
make
but
one
requirement
that
you
do
not
carry
the
child
out
of
the
country
yet
as
i
uttered
this
ultimatum
some
influence
acting
equally
upon
both
caused
us
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
river
possibly
an
apprehension
lest
some
word
of
this
conversation
might
be
overheard
by
the
child
or
the
nurse
a
surprise
awaited
us
which
effectually
prevented
carew
reply
in
the
corner
of
the
ocumpaugh
grounds
stood
a
man
staring
with
all
his
eyes
at
the
little
harry
an
expression
of
doubt
was
on
his
face
i
knew
the
minute
to
be
critical
and
was
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
do
you
know
that
man
i
whispered
to
carew
the
answer
was
brief
but
suggestive
of
alarm
yes
one
of
the
gardeners
over
there
one
of
whom
gwendolen
is
especially
fond
she
the
one
to
fear
then
engage
his
attention
while
i
divert
hers
all
this
in
a
whisper
while
the
man
was
summoning
up
courage
to
speak
a
pretty
child
he
stammered
as
carew
advanced
toward
him
smiling
is
that
your
little
nephew
i
heard
them
tell
about
seems
to
me
he
looks
like
our
own
little
lost
one
only
darker
and
sturdier
much
sturdier
i
heard
her
say
as
i
made
haste
to
accost
the
child
harry
i
cried
recalling
my
old
address
when
i
was
in
training
for
a
gentleman
your
aunt
is
in
a
hurry
the
cars
are
coming
do
you
hear
the
whistle
will
you
trust
yourself
to
me
let
me
carry
you
i
mean
while
we
run
for
the
train
the
sweet
eyes
looked
up
it
was
fortunate
for
carew
that
no
one
but
myself
had
ever
got
near
enough
to
see
those
eyes
or
she
could
hardly
have
kept
her
secret
and
at
first
slowly
then
with
instinctive
trust
the
little
arms
rose
and
i
caught
her
to
my
breast
taking
care
as
i
did
so
to
turn
her
quite
away
from
the
man
whom
carew
was
about
leaving
come
i
shouted
back
we
shall
be
late
and
made
a
dash
for
the
gate
carew
joined
me
and
none
of
us
said
anything
till
we
reached
the
station
platform
then
as
i
set
the
child
down
i
gave
her
one
look
she
was
beaming
with
gratitude
that
saved
us
together
with
the
few
words
i
could
edge
in
between
his
loud
regrets
at
my
going
and
his
exclamations
of
grief
over
loss
on
the
train
i
shall
fear
nothing
if
you
will
lift
him
up
i
will
wrap
him
in
this
shawl
as
if
he
were
once
in
new
york
are
you
not
going
to
permit
me
to
go
to
new
york
yes
but
not
to
the
steamer
she
showed
anger
but
also
an
admirable
far
off
we
could
catch
the
sounding
thrill
of
the
approaching
train
i
yield
she
announced
suddenly
and
opening
the
bag
at
her
side
she
fumbled
in
it
for
a
card
which
she
presently
put
in
my
hand
i
was
going
there
for
lunch
she
explained
now
i
will
take
a
room
and
remain
until
i
hear
from
you
here
she
gave
me
a
quick
look
you
do
not
appear
satisfied
yes
yes
i
stammered
as
i
looked
at
the
card
and
saw
her
name
over
that
of
an
inconspicuous
hotel
in
the
portion
of
new
york
city
i
merely
the
nearing
of
the
train
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
cutting
short
the
sentence
i
should
have
found
it
difficult
to
finish
here
is
the
child
i
exclaimed
lifting
the
little
one
whom
she
immediately
enveloped
in
the
light
but
ample
wrap
she
had
chosen
as
a
disguise
harry
i
like
you
your
arms
are
strong
and
you
do
shake
me
when
you
run
carew
smiled
there
was
deep
emotion
in
her
face
revoir
she
murmured
in
a
tone
implying
promise
happily
i
understood
the
french
phrase
i
bowed
and
drew
back
was
i
wrong
in
letting
her
slip
from
my
surveillance
the
agitation
i
probably
showed
must
have
caused
her
some
thought
but
she
would
have
been
more
than
a
diviner
of
mysteries
to
have
understood
its
cause
her
bag
when
she
had
opened
it
before
my
eyes
had
revealed
among
its
contents
a
string
of
remarkable
corals
a
bead
similar
in
shape
color
and
marking
rested
at
that
very
moment
over
my
own
heart
was
that
necklace
one
bead
short
with
a
start
of
conviction
i
began
to
believe
so
and
that
i
was
the
man
who
could
complete
it
if
that
was
so
why
then
then
it
is
often
that
a
detective
brain
reels
but
mine
did
then
the
train
began
to
move
this
discovery
the
greatest
of
all
if
i
were
right
would
i
had
no
more
time
to
think
instinctively
with
a
quick
jump
i
made
my
place
good
on
the
rear
car
xxiv
shall
i
give
him
my
word
harry
i
did
not
go
all
the
way
to
new
york
on
the
train
which
carew
and
the
child
had
taken
i
went
only
as
far
as
yonkers
when
i
reached
doctor
pool
house
i
thought
it
entirely
empty
even
the
office
seemed
closed
but
appearances
here
could
not
always
be
trusted
and
i
rang
the
bell
with
a
vigor
which
must
have
awakened
echoes
in
the
uninhabited
upper
stories
i
know
that
it
brought
the
doctor
to
the
door
and
in
a
state
of
doubtful
amiability
but
when
he
saw
who
awaited
him
his
appearance
changed
and
he
welcomed
me
in
with
a
smile
or
what
was
as
nearly
like
one
as
his
austere
nature
would
permit
how
now
want
your
money
seems
to
me
you
have
earned
it
with
unexpected
ease
not
such
great
ease
i
replied
as
he
carefully
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
i
know
that
i
feel
as
tired
as
i
ever
did
in
my
life
the
child
is
in
new
york
under
the
guardianship
of
a
woman
who
is
really
fond
of
her
you
can
dismiss
all
care
concerning
her
i
see
and
who
is
the
woman
name
her
you
do
not
trust
me
i
see
i
trust
no
one
in
business
matters
this
is
not
a
business
matter
yet
what
do
you
mean
i
have
not
asked
for
money
i
am
not
going
to
till
i
can
perfectly
satisfy
you
that
all
deception
is
at
an
end
so
far
as
ocumpaugh
at
least
is
concerned
oh
you
would
play
fair
i
see
i
was
too
interested
in
noting
how
each
of
his
hands
involuntarily
closed
on
itself
in
his
relief
at
not
being
called
upon
to
part
with
some
of
his
hoardings
to
answer
with
aught
but
a
nod
you
have
your
reasons
for
keeping
close
of
course
he
growled
as
he
led
the
way
toward
the
basement
stairs
you
not
out
of
the
woods
is
that
it
or
has
the
great
lady
bargained
with
you
um
um
he
threw
the
latter
ejaculations
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
descended
to
the
office
they
displeased
me
and
i
made
no
attempt
to
reply
in
fact
i
had
no
reply
ready
had
i
bargained
with
ocumpaugh
hardly
yet
she
is
handsome
enough
the
old
man
broke
in
sharply
cutting
in
two
my
you
a
fellow
of
some
stamina
if
you
have
got
at
her
secret
without
making
her
a
promise
so
the
child
is
well
good
there
one
long
black
mark
eliminated
from
my
account
but
i
have
not
closed
the
book
and
i
am
not
going
to
till
my
conscience
has
nothing
more
to
regret
it
is
not
enough
that
the
child
is
handed
over
to
a
different
life
the
fortunes
that
have
been
bequeathed
her
must
be
given
to
him
who
would
have
inherited
them
had
this
child
not
been
taken
for
a
veritable
ocumpaugh
that
raises
a
nice
point
i
said
but
one
that
will
drag
all
false
things
to
light
your
action
in
the
matter
along
with
the
rest
i
suggested
true
but
do
you
think
i
shall
stop
because
of
that
he
did
not
look
as
if
he
would
stop
because
of
anything
do
you
not
think
ocumpaugh
worthy
some
pity
her
future
is
a
ghastly
one
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
she
sinned
was
his
uncompromising
reply
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
but
such
death
i
protested
death
of
the
heart
which
is
the
worst
death
of
all
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
leading
the
way
into
the
office
let
her
beware
he
went
on
surlily
last
month
i
saw
my
duty
no
further
than
the
exaction
of
this
child
dismissal
from
the
home
whose
benefits
she
enjoyed
under
a
false
name
i
am
led
further
by
the
inexorable
guide
which
prompts
the
anxious
soul
all
that
was
wrong
must
be
made
good
ocumpaugh
must
know
on
whom
his
affections
have
been
lavished
i
will
not
yield
the
woman
has
done
wrong
and
she
shall
suffer
for
it
till
she
rises
a
redeemed
soul
into
a
state
of
mind
that
prefers
humiliation
to
a
continuance
in
a
life
of
deception
you
may
tell
her
what
i
say
that
is
if
you
enjoy
the
right
of
conversation
with
her
the
look
he
shot
me
at
this
was
keen
as
hate
and
spite
could
make
it
i
was
glad
that
we
were
by
this
time
in
the
office
and
that
i
could
avoid
his
eye
by
a
quick
look
about
the
place
this
proof
of
the
vindictive
pursuit
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
was
no
surprise
to
me
i
expected
no
less
yet
it
opened
up
difficulties
which
made
my
way
as
well
as
hers
look
dreary
in
the
prospect
he
perceived
my
despondency
and
smiled
then
suddenly
changed
his
tone
you
do
not
ask
after
the
little
patient
i
have
here
come
harry
come
here
is
some
one
i
will
let
you
see
the
door
of
my
old
room
swung
open
and
i
do
not
know
which
surprised
me
most
the
kindness
in
the
rugged
old
voice
i
had
never
before
heard
lifted
in
tenderness
or
the
look
of
confidence
and
joy
on
the
face
of
the
little
boy
who
now
came
running
in
so
inexorable
to
a
remorseful
and
suffering
woman
and
so
full
of
consideration
for
a
child
almost
well
pronounced
the
doctor
and
lifted
him
on
his
knee
do
you
know
this
child
parentage
and
condition
he
sharply
inquired
with
a
quick
look
toward
me
i
saw
no
reason
for
not
telling
the
truth
he
is
an
orphan
and
was
destined
for
an
institution
you
know
this
positively
then
i
shall
keep
the
child
harry
will
you
stay
with
me
to
my
amazement
the
little
arms
crept
round
his
neck
a
smile
grim
enough
in
my
estimation
but
not
at
all
frightful
to
the
child
responded
to
this
appeal
i
did
not
like
the
old
man
and
woman
he
said
doctor
pool
whole
manner
showed
triumph
i
shall
treat
him
better
than
i
did
you
he
remarked
i
am
a
regenerate
man
now
i
bowed
i
was
very
uneasy
there
was
a
question
i
wanted
to
ask
and
could
not
in
the
presence
of
this
child
he
is
hardly
of
an
age
to
take
my
place
i
observed
still
under
the
spell
of
my
surprise
for
the
child
was
handling
the
old
man
long
beard
and
seeming
almost
as
happy
as
gwendolen
did
in
arms
he
will
have
one
of
his
own
was
the
doctor
unexpected
reply
i
rose
i
saw
that
he
did
not
intend
to
dismiss
the
child
i
should
like
your
word
in
return
for
the
relief
i
have
undoubtedly
brought
you
that
you
will
not
molest
certain
parties
till
the
three
days
are
up
which
i
have
mentioned
as
the
limit
of
my
own
silence
shall
i
give
him
my
word
harry
the
child
startled
by
the
abrupt
address
drew
his
fingers
from
the
long
beard
he
was
playfully
stroking
and
eyeing
me
with
elfish
gravity
seemed
to
ponder
the
question
as
if
some
comprehension
of
its
importance
had
found
entrance
into
his
small
brain
annoyed
at
the
doctor
whim
yet
trusting
to
the
child
intuition
i
waited
with
inner
anxiety
for
what
those
small
lips
would
say
and
felt
an
infinite
relief
even
if
i
did
not
show
it
when
he
finally
uttered
a
faint
yes
and
hid
his
face
again
on
the
doctor
breast
my
last
remembrance
of
them
both
was
the
picture
they
made
as
the
doctor
closed
the
door
upon
me
with
the
sweet
confiding
child
still
clasped
in
his
arms
xxv
the
work
of
an
instant
i
did
not
take
the
car
at
the
corner
i
was
sure
that
jupp
was
somewhere
around
and
i
had
a
new
mission
for
him
of
more
importance
than
any
he
could
find
here
now
i
was
just
looking
about
for
him
when
i
heard
cries
and
screams
at
my
back
and
turning
saw
several
persons
all
running
one
way
as
that
way
was
the
one
by
which
i
had
just
come
i
commenced
running
too
and
in
another
moment
was
one
of
a
crowd
collected
before
the
doctor
door
i
mean
the
great
front
door
which
to
my
astonishment
i
had
already
seen
was
wide
open
the
sight
which
there
met
my
eyes
almost
paralyzed
me
stretched
on
the
pavement
spotted
with
blood
lay
the
two
figures
i
had
seen
within
the
last
five
minutes
beaming
with
life
and
energy
the
old
man
was
dead
the
child
dying
one
little
hand
outstretched
as
if
in
search
of
the
sympathetic
touch
which
had
made
the
last
few
hours
perhaps
the
sweetest
of
his
life
how
had
it
happened
was
it
suicide
on
the
doctor
part
or
just
pure
accident
either
way
it
was
horrible
but
i
looked
about
me
there
was
a
man
ready
to
give
explanations
he
had
seen
it
all
the
doctor
had
been
racing
with
the
child
in
the
long
hall
he
had
opened
the
door
probably
for
air
a
sudden
dash
of
the
child
had
brought
him
to
the
verge
the
doctor
had
plunged
to
save
him
and
losing
his
balance
toppled
headlong
to
the
street
carrying
the
child
with
him
it
was
all
the
work
of
an
instant
one
moment
two
vigorous
figures
the
next
a
mass
of
crushed
humanity
a
sight
to
stagger
a
man
soul
but
the
thought
which
came
with
it
staggered
me
still
more
the
force
which
had
been
driving
ocumpaugh
to
her
fate
was
removed
henceforth
her
secret
was
safe
if
if
i
chose
to
have
it
so
xxvi
he
will
never
forgive
i
was
walking
away
when
a
man
touched
me
some
one
had
seen
me
come
from
the
doctor
office
a
few
minutes
before
of
course
this
meant
detention
till
the
coroner
should
arrive
i
quarreled
with
the
circumstances
but
felt
forced
to
submit
happily
jupp
now
came
to
the
front
and
i
was
able
to
send
him
to
new
york
to
keep
that
watch
over
carew
without
which
i
could
not
have
rested
quiet
an
hour
one
great
element
of
danger
was
removed
most
remarkably
if
not
providentially
from
the
path
i
had
marked
out
for
myself
but
there
still
remained
that
of
this
possible
impulses
under
her
great
determination
to
keep
gwendolen
in
her
own
care
but
with
jupp
to
watch
the
dock
and
a
man
in
plain
clothes
at
the
door
of
the
small
hotel
she
was
at
present
bound
for
i
thought
i
might
remain
in
yonkers
contentedly
the
whole
day
it
was
not
however
till
late
the
next
afternoon
that
i
found
myself
again
in
homewood
i
had
heard
from
jupp
the
steamer
had
sailed
but
without
two
passengers
who
had
been
booked
for
the
voyage
carew
and
the
child
were
still
at
the
address
she
had
given
me
all
looked
well
in
that
direction
but
what
was
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
homewood
i
trembled
in
some
anticipation
of
what
these
many
hours
of
bitter
thought
might
have
effected
in
ocumpaugh
evidently
nothing
to
lessen
the
gloom
into
which
the
whole
household
had
now
fallen
miss
porter
who
came
in
haste
to
greet
me
wore
the
careworn
look
of
a
long
and
unrelieved
vigil
i
was
not
astonished
when
she
told
me
that
she
had
not
slept
a
wink
how
could
i
she
asked
when
ocumpaugh
did
not
close
her
eyes
she
did
not
even
lie
down
but
sat
all
night
in
an
which
she
had
wheeled
into
gwendolen
room
staring
like
one
who
sees
nothing
out
into
the
night
through
the
window
which
overlooks
the
river
this
morning
we
can
not
make
her
speak
her
eyes
are
dry
with
fever
only
now
and
then
she
utters
a
little
moan
the
doctor
says
she
will
not
live
to
see
her
husband
unless
something
comes
to
rouse
her
but
the
papers
give
no
news
and
all
the
attempts
of
the
police
end
in
nothing
you
saw
what
a
dismal
failure
their
last
attempt
was
the
child
on
which
they
counted
proved
to
be
both
and
gwendolen
appears
to
be
lost
lost
in
spite
of
the
despair
thus
expressed
my
way
seemed
to
open
a
little
i
think
i
can
break
ocumpaugh
dangerous
apathy
if
you
will
let
me
see
her
again
will
you
let
me
try
the
nurse
we
have
a
nurse
now
will
not
consent
i
fear
then
telephone
to
the
doctor
tell
him
i
am
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
for
ocumpaugh
this
will
not
be
an
exaggeration
wait
i
will
get
his
order
i
do
not
know
why
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
you
in
another
fifteen
minutes
she
came
to
lead
me
to
ocumpaugh
i
entered
without
knocking
they
told
me
to
she
was
seated
as
they
said
in
a
large
chair
but
with
no
ease
to
herself
for
she
was
not
even
leaning
against
its
back
but
sat
with
body
strained
forward
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
ripple
of
the
great
river
where
from
what
she
had
intimated
to
me
in
our
last
interview
she
probably
saw
her
grave
there
was
a
miniature
in
her
hand
but
i
saw
at
first
glance
that
it
was
not
the
face
of
gwendolen
over
which
her
fingers
closed
so
spasmodically
it
was
her
husband
portrait
which
she
held
and
it
was
his
face
aroused
and
full
of
denunciation
which
she
evidently
saw
in
her
fancy
as
i
drew
nearer
her
in
my
efforts
to
attract
her
attention
for
a
shiver
suddenly
contracted
her
lovely
features
and
she
threw
her
arms
out
as
if
to
ward
from
herself
something
which
she
had
no
power
to
meet
in
doing
this
her
head
turned
slightly
and
she
saw
me
instantly
the
spell
under
which
she
sat
frozen
yielded
to
a
recognition
of
something
besides
her
own
terrible
brooding
she
let
her
arms
drop
and
the
lips
which
had
not
spoken
that
morning
moved
slightly
i
waited
respectfully
i
saw
that
in
another
moment
she
would
speak
you
have
come
she
panted
out
at
last
to
hear
my
decision
it
is
too
soon
the
steamer
has
hours
yet
before
it
can
make
port
i
have
not
finished
weighing
my
life
against
the
good
opinion
of
him
i
live
for
then
faintly
carew
has
gone
to
new
york
i
finished
no
farther
than
that
she
asked
anxiously
she
has
not
sailed
i
did
not
see
how
it
was
compatible
with
my
duty
to
let
her
ocumpaugh
whole
form
collapsed
the
dangerous
apathy
was
creeping
over
her
again
you
are
deciding
for
me
she
spoke
very
faintly
you
and
doctor
pool
should
i
tell
her
that
doctor
pool
was
dead
no
not
yet
i
wanted
her
to
choose
the
noble
course
for
ocumpaugh
sake
yes
and
for
her
own
no
i
ventured
to
rejoin
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
settle
your
own
fate
the
word
must
come
from
you
i
am
only
trying
to
make
it
possible
for
you
to
meet
your
husband
without
any
additional
wrong
to
blunt
his
possible
forgiveness
oh
he
will
never
forgive
and
i
have
lost
all
and
the
set
look
returned
in
its
full
force
i
made
my
final
attempt
ocumpaugh
we
may
never
have
another
moment
together
in
confidence
there
is
one
thing
i
have
never
told
you
something
which
i
think
you
ought
to
know
as
it
may
affect
your
whole
future
course
it
concerns
gwendolen
real
mother
you
say
you
do
not
know
her
no
no
do
not
bring
up
that
i
do
not
want
to
know
her
my
darling
is
happy
with
carew
too
happy
o
god
give
me
no
opportunity
for
disturbing
that
contentment
do
you
see
that
i
am
consumed
with
jealousy
that
i
might
she
was
roused
enough
now
cheek
and
lip
and
brow
were
red
even
her
eyes
looked
alarmed
i
put
out
my
hand
in
a
soothing
gesture
and
when
her
voice
stopped
and
her
words
trailed
off
into
an
inarticulate
murmur
i
made
haste
to
say
listen
to
my
little
story
it
will
not
add
to
your
pain
rather
alleviate
it
when
i
hid
behind
the
curtain
on
that
day
we
all
regret
i
did
not
slip
from
my
post
at
your
departure
i
knew
that
another
patient
awaited
the
doctor
convenience
in
my
own
small
room
where
he
had
hastily
seated
her
when
your
carriage
drove
up
i
also
knew
that
this
patient
had
overheard
what
you
said
as
well
as
i
for
impervious
as
the
door
looked
i
had
often
heard
the
doctor
mutterings
when
he
thought
i
was
safe
beyond
if
not
asleep
and
i
wanted
to
see
how
she
would
act
when
she
rejoined
the
doctor
for
i
had
heard
a
little
of
what
she
had
said
before
and
was
quite
aware
that
she
could
help
you
out
of
your
difficulty
if
she
wished
she
was
a
married
woman
or
rather
had
been
but
she
had
no
use
for
a
child
being
very
poor
and
anxious
to
earn
her
own
living
would
she
embrace
this
opportunity
to
part
with
it
when
it
came
you
may
imagine
my
interest
boy
though
i
was
and
did
she
was
she
yes
she
was
ready
to
make
her
compact
with
the
doctor
just
as
you
had
done
before
she
left
everything
was
arranged
for
it
was
her
child
you
took
reared
loved
and
have
now
lost
at
another
time
she
might
have
resented
these
words
especially
the
last
but
i
had
roused
her
curiosity
her
panting
eager
curiosity
and
she
let
them
pass
altogether
unchallenged
did
you
see
this
woman
was
she
of
common
blood
common
manners
it
does
not
seem
possible
gwendolen
is
by
nature
so
dainty
in
all
her
ways
the
woman
was
a
lady
i
did
not
see
her
face
it
was
heavily
veiled
but
i
heard
her
voice
it
was
a
lady
voice
and
what
she
wore
beautiful
jewels
jewels
you
said
she
was
poor
so
she
declared
herself
but
she
had
on
her
neck
under
her
coat
a
string
of
beads
which
were
both
valuable
and
of
exquisite
workmanship
i
know
because
it
broke
just
as
she
was
leaving
and
the
beads
fell
all
over
the
floor
and
one
rolled
my
way
and
i
picked
it
up
scamp
that
i
was
when
both
their
backs
were
turned
in
their
search
for
the
others
a
bead
a
costly
bead
and
you
were
not
found
out
no
ocumpaugh
she
never
seemed
to
miss
it
she
was
too
excited
over
what
she
had
just
done
to
count
correctly
she
thought
she
had
them
all
but
this
has
been
in
my
pocket
for
six
years
perhaps
you
have
seen
its
like
i
never
have
in
jeweler
shop
or
elsewhere
till
yesterday
yesterday
her
great
eyes
haggard
with
suffering
rose
to
mine
then
they
fell
on
the
bead
which
i
had
taken
from
my
pocket
the
cry
she
gave
was
not
loud
but
it
effectually
settled
all
my
doubts
what
did
you
know
of
carew
before
she
came
to
i
asked
impressively
for
minutes
she
did
not
answer
she
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
her
mother
she
exclaimed
at
last
her
mother
her
own
mother
and
she
never
hinted
it
to
me
by
word
or
look
oh
valerie
valerie
what
tortures
we
have
both
suffered
and
now
you
are
happy
while
i
grief
seemed
to
engulf
her
feeling
my
position
keenly
i
walked
to
the
window
but
soon
turned
and
came
back
in
response
to
her
cry
i
must
see
carew
instantly
give
my
orders
i
will
start
at
once
to
new
york
they
will
think
i
have
gone
to
be
on
hand
to
meet
ocumpaugh
and
will
say
that
i
have
not
the
strength
override
their
objections
i
put
my
whole
cause
in
your
hands
you
will
go
with
me
with
pleasure
madam
and
thus
was
that
terrifying
apathy
broken
up
to
be
succeeded
by
a
spell
of
equally
terrifying
energy
xxvii
the
final
struggle
she
however
did
not
get
off
that
night
i
dared
not
push
the
matter
to
the
point
of
awakening
suspicion
and
when
the
doctor
said
that
the
ship
was
not
due
for
twenty
hours
and
that
it
would
be
madness
for
her
to
start
without
a
night
rest
and
two
or
three
good
meals
i
succumbed
and
she
also
to
the
few
hours
delay
more
than
that
she
consented
to
retire
and
when
i
joined
her
in
her
carriage
the
following
morning
it
was
to
find
her
physically
stronger
even
if
the
mind
was
still
a
prey
to
deepest
anguish
and
a
torturing
indecision
her
nurse
accompanied
us
and
the
maid
called
celia
so
conversation
was
impossible
a
fact
i
did
not
know
whether
to
be
thankful
for
or
not
on
the
cars
she
was
shielded
as
much
as
possible
from
every
one
gaze
and
when
we
reached
new
york
we
were
driven
at
once
to
the
plaza
as
i
noticed
the
respect
and
intense
sympathy
with
which
her
presence
was
met
by
those
who
saw
nothing
in
her
broken
aspect
but
a
mother
immeasurable
grief
i
wondered
at
the
secrets
which
lie
deep
down
in
the
hearts
of
humanity
and
what
the
effect
would
be
if
i
should
suddenly
shout
aloud
she
is
more
wretched
than
you
think
her
suspense
is
one
that
the
child
return
would
not
appease
dig
deeper
into
mortal
fear
and
woe
if
you
would
know
what
has
changed
this
beautiful
woman
into
a
shadow
in
five
days
and
i
myself
did
not
know
her
mind
i
could
neither
foresee
what
she
contemplated
nor
what
the
effect
of
seeing
the
child
again
would
have
upon
her
i
only
knew
that
she
must
never
for
a
moment
be
out
of
sight
of
some
one
who
loved
her
i
myself
never
left
the
hall
upon
which
her
room
opened
a
precaution
for
which
i
felt
grateful
when
late
in
the
evening
she
opened
the
door
and
seeing
me
stepped
out
fully
dressed
for
the
street
come
and
tell
sister
angelina
that
i
may
be
trusted
with
you
she
said
sister
angelina
was
the
nurse
of
course
i
did
as
she
bade
me
and
after
some
few
more
difficulties
i
succeeded
in
getting
her
into
a
carriage
without
attracting
any
special
attention
once
there
she
breathed
more
easily
and
so
did
i
now
take
me
to
she
said
whether
she
meant
carew
or
gwendolen
i
never
knew
i
now
saw
that
the
hour
had
come
for
telling
her
that
she
no
longer
need
have
any
fear
of
doctor
pool
whatever
she
contemplated
must
be
done
with
a
true
knowledge
of
where
she
stood
and
to
just
what
extent
her
secret
remained
endangered
i
do
not
know
if
she
felt
grateful
i
almost
think
that
for
the
first
few
minutes
she
felt
rather
frightened
than
relieved
to
find
herself
free
to
act
as
her
wishes
and
the
preservation
of
her
place
in
her
husband
heart
and
the
world
regard
impelled
her
for
she
never
for
a
moment
seemed
to
doubt
that
now
the
doctor
was
gone
i
would
yield
to
her
misery
and
prove
myself
the
friend
she
had
begged
me
to
be
from
the
first
she
turned
herself
toward
me
and
sought
to
read
my
face
but
it
was
rather
to
find
out
what
i
expected
of
her
than
what
she
had
yet
to
fear
from
me
i
noted
this
and
muttered
some
words
of
confidence
but
her
mood
had
already
changed
and
they
fell
on
deaf
ears
i
was
not
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
two
women
that
is
i
remained
in
what
they
would
call
a
private
parlor
while
ocumpaugh
passed
into
the
inner
room
where
she
knew
she
would
find
carew
and
the
child
nor
did
i
hear
much
some
words
came
through
the
partition
i
caught
most
of
carew
explanation
of
how
she
came
to
give
up
her
child
she
was
an
actress
at
the
time
with
a
london
success
to
her
credit
but
with
no
hold
as
yet
in
this
country
she
was
booked
for
a
tour
the
coming
season
the
husband
who
might
have
seen
to
the
child
was
dead
she
had
no
friends
no
relatives
here
save
a
brother
poorer
than
herself
and
the
mother
instinct
had
not
awakened
she
bartered
her
child
away
as
she
would
have
parted
with
any
other
encumbrance
likely
to
interfere
with
her
career
but
here
her
voice
rose
and
i
heard
distinctly
a
fortune
was
suddenly
left
me
an
old
admirer
dying
abroad
bequeathed
me
two
million
dollars
and
i
found
myself
rich
admired
and
independent
with
no
one
on
earth
to
care
for
or
to
share
the
happiness
of
what
seemed
to
me
after
the
brilliant
life
i
had
hitherto
led
a
dreary
inaction
love
had
no
interest
for
me
i
had
had
a
husband
and
that
part
of
my
nature
had
been
satisfied
what
i
wanted
now
and
the
wish
presently
grew
into
a
passion
was
my
child
from
passion
it
grew
to
mania
knowing
the
name
of
her
to
whom
i
had
yielded
it
i
had
overheard
it
in
the
doctor
office
i
hunted
up
your
residence
and
came
one
day
to
homewood
perhaps
some
old
servant
can
be
found
there
who
could
tell
you
of
the
strange
deeply
veiled
lady
who
was
found
one
evening
at
sunset
clinging
to
the
gate
with
both
hands
and
sobbing
as
she
looked
in
at
the
triumphant
little
heiress
racing
up
and
down
the
walks
with
the
great
mastiff
don
they
will
say
that
it
was
some
poor
crazy
woman
or
some
mother
who
had
buried
her
own
little
darling
but
it
was
i
marion
it
was
i
looking
upon
the
child
i
had
sold
for
a
independence
i
who
was
now
for
her
smiles
and
touches
and
saw
them
all
given
to
strangers
who
had
made
her
a
princess
but
who
could
never
give
her
such
love
as
i
felt
for
her
then
in
my
madness
i
went
away
that
time
but
i
came
again
soon
with
the
titles
of
the
adjoining
property
in
my
pocket
i
could
not
keep
away
from
the
sight
of
her
and
felt
that
the
torture
would
be
less
to
see
her
in
your
arms
than
not
to
see
her
at
all
the
answer
was
not
audible
but
i
could
well
imagine
what
it
was
as
every
one
knew
the
false
mother
had
not
long
held
out
against
the
attractions
of
the
true
one
instinct
had
drawn
the
little
one
to
the
heart
that
beat
responsive
to
its
own
what
followed
i
could
best
judge
from
the
frightened
cry
which
the
child
suddenly
gave
she
had
evidently
waked
to
find
both
women
at
her
bedside
carew
hush
hush
did
not
answer
this
time
the
child
was
in
a
frenzy
and
evidently
turned
from
one
to
the
other
sobbing
out
alternately
i
will
not
be
a
girl
again
i
like
my
horse
and
going
to
papa
and
sailing
on
the
big
ocean
in
trousers
and
a
little
cap
and
the
softer
phrases
she
evidently
felt
better
suited
to
deep
distress
do
feel
bad
mamma
you
shall
come
see
me
some
time
papa
will
send
for
you
i
am
going
to
him
then
silence
then
such
a
struggle
of
with
as
i
hope
never
to
be
witness
to
again
ocumpaugh
was
pleading
with
carew
not
for
the
child
but
for
her
life
ocumpaugh
would
be
in
port
the
next
morning
if
she
could
show
him
the
child
all
would
be
well
trevitt
would
manage
the
details
take
the
credit
of
having
found
gwendolen
somewhere
in
this
great
city
and
that
would
insure
him
the
reward
and
them
his
silence
i
heard
this
there
was
no
one
else
to
fear
doctor
pool
the
cause
of
all
this
misery
was
dead
and
in
the
future
her
heart
being
set
to
rest
about
her
secret
she
would
be
happier
and
make
the
child
happier
and
they
could
enjoy
her
between
them
and
she
would
be
unselfish
and
let
gwendolen
spend
an
hour
or
more
every
day
with
carew
on
some
such
plea
as
lessons
in
and
music
thus
pleaded
ocumpaugh
but
the
mother
hardly
listened
she
had
eaten
with
the
child
slept
with
the
child
and
almost
breathed
with
the
child
for
three
days
now
and
the
ecstasy
of
the
experience
had
blinded
her
to
any
other
claim
than
her
own
she
pitied
ocumpaugh
pitied
most
of
all
her
deceived
husband
but
no
grief
of
theirs
could
equal
that
of
rachel
crying
for
her
child
let
ocumpaugh
remember
that
when
the
evil
days
come
she
had
separated
child
from
mother
child
from
mother
oh
how
the
wail
swept
through
those
two
rooms
i
dared
not
prophesy
to
myself
at
this
point
how
this
would
end
i
simply
waited
their
voices
had
sunk
after
each
passionate
outbreak
and
i
was
only
able
to
catch
now
and
then
a
word
which
told
me
that
the
struggle
was
yet
going
on
but
finally
there
came
a
lull
and
while
i
wondered
the
door
flew
suddenly
open
and
i
saw
ocumpaugh
standing
on
the
threshold
pallid
and
stricken
looking
back
at
the
picture
made
by
the
other
two
as
carew
fallen
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
held
to
her
breast
the
panting
child
i
can
not
go
against
nature
said
she
keep
gwendolen
and
may
god
have
pity
upon
me
and
philo
i
stepped
forward
meeting
my
eye
she
faltered
this
last
word
your
advice
was
good
when
i
meet
my
husband
i
will
tell
him
who
found
the
child
and
why
that
child
is
not
at
my
side
to
greet
him
that
night
i
had
a
vision
i
saw
a
door
shut
ominous
before
that
door
stood
a
woman
tall
pale
beautiful
she
was
there
to
enter
but
to
what
no
mortal
living
could
say
she
saw
nothing
but
loss
and
the
hollowness
of
a
living
death
behind
that
closed
door
but
who
knows
angels
spring
up
unknown
on
the
darkest
road
and
perhaps
here
the
vision
broke
the
day
and
its
possibilities
lay
before
me
