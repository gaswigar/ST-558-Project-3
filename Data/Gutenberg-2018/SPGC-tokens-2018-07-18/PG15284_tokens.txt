tale
of
johnny
by
beatrix
potter
author
of
the
tale
of
peter
rabbit
frederick
warne
new
york
to
aesop
in
the
shadows
johnny
was
born
in
a
cupboard
timmy
willie
was
born
in
a
garden
timmy
willie
was
a
little
country
mouse
who
went
to
town
by
mistake
in
a
hamper
the
gardener
sent
vegetables
to
town
once
a
week
by
carrier
he
packed
them
in
a
big
hamper
the
gardener
left
the
hamper
by
the
garden
gate
so
that
the
carrier
could
pick
it
up
when
he
passed
timmy
willie
crept
in
through
a
hole
in
the
and
after
eating
some
peas
timmy
willie
fell
fast
asleep
he
awoke
in
a
fright
while
the
hamper
was
being
lifted
into
the
cart
then
there
was
a
jolting
and
a
clattering
of
horse
feet
other
packages
were
thrown
in
for
miles
and
miles
jolt
jolt
jolt
and
timmy
willie
trembled
amongst
the
jumbled
up
vegetables
at
last
the
cart
stopped
at
a
house
where
the
hamper
was
taken
out
carried
in
and
set
down
the
cook
gave
the
carrier
sixpence
the
back
door
banged
and
the
cart
rumbled
away
but
there
was
no
quiet
there
seemed
to
be
hundreds
of
carts
passing
dogs
barked
boys
whistled
in
the
street
the
cook
laughed
the
parlour
maid
ran
up
and
and
a
canary
sang
like
a
steam
engine
timmy
willie
who
had
lived
all
his
life
in
a
garden
was
almost
frightened
to
death
presently
the
cook
opened
the
hamper
and
began
to
unpack
the
vegetables
out
sprang
the
terrified
timmy
willie
up
jumped
the
cook
on
a
chair
exclaiming
a
mouse
a
mouse
call
the
cat
fetch
me
the
poker
sarah
timmy
willie
did
not
wait
for
sarah
with
the
poker
he
rushed
along
the
skirting
board
till
he
came
to
a
little
hole
and
in
he
popped
he
dropped
half
a
foot
and
crashed
into
the
middle
of
a
mouse
dinner
party
breaking
three
who
in
the
world
is
this
inquired
johnny
but
after
the
first
exclamation
of
surprise
he
instantly
recovered
his
manners
with
the
utmost
politeness
he
introduced
timmy
willie
to
nine
other
mice
all
with
long
tails
and
white
neckties
timmy
willie
own
tail
was
insignificant
johnny
and
his
friends
noticed
it
but
they
were
too
well
bred
to
make
personal
remarks
only
one
of
them
asked
timmy
willie
if
he
had
ever
been
in
a
trap
the
dinner
was
of
eight
courses
not
much
of
anything
but
truly
elegant
all
the
dishes
were
unknown
to
timmy
willie
who
would
have
been
a
little
afraid
of
tasting
them
only
he
was
very
hungry
and
very
anxious
to
behave
with
company
manners
the
continual
noise
upstairs
made
him
so
nervous
that
he
dropped
a
plate
never
mind
they
belong
to
us
said
johnny
why
do
those
youngsters
come
back
with
the
dessert
it
should
be
explained
that
two
young
mice
who
were
waiting
on
the
others
went
skirmishing
upstairs
to
the
kitchen
between
courses
several
times
they
had
come
tumbling
in
squeaking
and
laughing
timmy
willie
learnt
with
horror
that
they
were
being
chased
by
the
cat
his
appetite
failed
he
felt
faint
try
some
jelly
said
johnny
no
would
you
rather
go
to
bed
i
will
show
you
a
most
comfortable
sofa
pillow
the
sofa
pillow
had
a
hole
in
it
johnny
quite
honestly
recommended
it
as
the
best
bed
kept
exclusively
for
visitors
but
the
sofa
smelt
of
cat
timmy
willie
preferred
to
spend
a
miserable
night
under
the
fender
it
was
just
the
same
next
day
an
excellent
breakfast
was
provided
for
mice
accustomed
to
eat
bacon
but
timmy
willie
had
been
reared
on
roots
and
salad
johnny
and
his
friends
racketted
about
under
the
floors
and
came
boldly
out
all
over
the
house
in
the
evening
one
particularly
loud
crash
had
been
caused
by
sarah
tumbling
downstairs
with
the
there
were
crumbs
and
sugar
and
smears
of
jam
to
be
collected
in
spite
of
the
cat
timmy
willie
longed
to
be
at
home
in
his
peaceful
nest
in
a
sunny
bank
the
food
disagreed
with
him
the
noise
prevented
him
from
sleeping
in
a
few
days
he
grew
so
thin
that
johnny
noticed
it
and
questioned
him
he
listened
to
timmy
willie
story
and
inquired
about
the
garden
it
sounds
rather
a
dull
place
what
do
you
do
when
it
rains
when
it
rains
i
sit
in
my
little
sandy
burrow
and
shell
corn
and
seeds
from
my
autumn
store
i
peep
out
at
the
throstles
and
blackbirds
on
the
lawn
and
my
friend
cock
robin
and
when
the
sun
comes
out
again
you
should
see
my
garden
and
the
flowers
roses
and
pinks
and
pansies
no
noise
except
the
birds
and
bees
and
the
lambs
in
the
meadows
there
goes
that
cat
again
exclaimed
johnny
when
they
had
taken
refuge
in
the
he
resumed
the
conversation
i
confess
i
am
a
little
disappointed
we
have
endeavoured
to
entertain
you
timothy
william
oh
yes
yes
you
have
been
most
kind
but
i
do
feel
so
ill
said
timmy
willie
it
may
be
that
your
teeth
and
digestion
are
unaccustomed
to
our
food
perhaps
it
might
be
wiser
for
you
to
return
in
the
hamper
oh
oh
cried
timmy
willie
why
of
course
for
the
matter
of
that
we
could
have
sent
you
back
last
week
said
johnny
rather
huffily
did
you
not
know
that
the
hamper
goes
back
empty
on
saturdays
so
timmy
willie
said
to
his
new
friends
and
hid
in
the
hamper
with
a
crumb
of
cake
and
a
withered
cabbage
leaf
and
after
much
jolting
he
was
set
down
safely
in
his
own
garden
sometimes
on
saturdays
he
went
to
look
at
the
hamper
lying
by
the
gate
but
he
knew
better
than
to
get
in
again
and
nobody
got
out
though
johnny
had
half
promised
a
visit
the
winter
passed
the
sun
came
out
again
timmy
willie
sat
by
his
burrow
warming
his
little
fur
coat
and
sniffing
the
smell
of
violets
and
spring
grass
he
had
nearly
forgotten
his
visit
to
town
when
up
the
sandy
path
all
spick
and
span
with
a
brown
leather
bag
came
johnny
timmy
willie
received
him
with
open
arms
you
have
come
at
the
best
of
all
the
year
we
will
have
herb
pudding
and
sit
in
the
sun
it
is
a
little
damp
said
johnny
who
was
carrying
his
tail
under
his
arm
out
of
the
mud
what
is
that
fearful
noise
he
started
violently
that
said
timmy
willie
that
is
only
a
cow
i
will
beg
a
little
milk
they
are
quite
harmless
unless
they
happen
to
lie
down
upon
you
how
are
all
our
friends
johnny
account
was
rather
middling
he
explained
why
he
was
paying
his
visit
so
early
in
the
season
the
family
had
gone
to
the
for
easter
the
cook
was
doing
spring
cleaning
on
board
wages
with
particular
instructions
to
clear
out
the
mice
there
were
four
kittens
and
the
cat
had
killed
the
canary
they
say
we
did
it
but
i
know
better
said
johnny
whatever
is
that
fearful
racket
that
is
only
the
i
will
fetch
some
of
the
grass
clippings
presently
to
make
your
bed
i
am
sure
you
had
better
settle
in
the
country
johnny
we
shall
see
by
tuesday
week
the
hamper
is
stopped
while
they
are
at
the
i
am
sure
you
will
never
want
to
live
in
town
again
said
timmy
willie
but
he
did
he
went
back
in
the
very
next
hamper
of
vegetables
he
said
it
was
too
quiet
one
place
suits
one
person
another
place
suits
another
person
for
my
part
i
prefer
to
live
in
the
country
like
timmy
willie
