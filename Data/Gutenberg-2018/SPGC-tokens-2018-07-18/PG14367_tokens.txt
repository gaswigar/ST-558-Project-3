chapter

after

celebration
there
is
a
land
where
a
man
to
live
must
be
a
man
it
is
a
land
of
granite
and
marble
and
porphyry
and
gold
and
a
man
strength
must
be
as
the
strength
of
the
primeval
hills
it
is
a
land
of
oaks
and
cedars
and
pines
and
a
man
mental
grace
must
be
as
the
grace
of
the
untamed
trees
it
is
a
land
of
and
unstained
skies
where
the
wind
sweeps
free
and
untainted
and
the
atmosphere
is
the
atmosphere
of
those
places
that
remain
as
god
made
them
and
a
man
soul
must
be
as
the
unstained
skies
the
unburdened
wind
and
the
untainted
atmosphere
it
is
a
land
of
wide
mesas
of
wild
rolling
pastures
and
broad
untilled
valley
meadows
and
a
man
freedom
must
be
that
freedom
which
is
not
bounded
by
the
fences
of
a
too
weak
and
timid
conventionalism
in
this
land
every
man
is
by
divine
right
his
own
king
he
is
his
own
jury
his
own
counsel
his
own
judge
and
if
it
must
be
his
own
executioner
and
in
this
land
where
a
man
to
live
must
be
a
man
a
woman
if
she
be
not
a
woman
must
surely
perish
this
is
the
story
of
a
man
who
regained
that
which
in
his
youth
had
been
lost
to
him
and
of
how
even
when
he
had
recovered
that
which
had
been
taken
from
him
he
still
paid
the
price
of
his
loss
it
is
the
story
of
a
woman
who
was
saved
from
herself
and
of
how
she
was
led
to
hold
fast
to
those
things
the
loss
of
which
cost
the
man
so
great
a
price
the
story
as
i
have
put
it
down
here
begins
at
prescott
arizona
on
the
day
following
the
annual
celebration
in
one
of
those
years
that
saw
the
passing
of
the
indian
and
the
coming
of
the
automobile
the
man
was
walking
along
one
of
the
few
roads
that
lead
out
from
the
little
city
through
the
mountain
gaps
and
passes
to
the
wide
unfenced
ranges
and
to
the
lonely
scattered
ranches
on
the
creeks
and
flats
and
valleys
of
the
great
open
country
that
lies
beyond
from
the
fact
that
he
was
walking
in
that
land
where
the
distances
are
such
that
men
most
commonly
ride
and
from
the
many
marks
that
environment
and
training
leave
upon
us
all
it
was
evident
that
the
pedestrian
was
a
stranger
he
was
a
man
in
the
prime
of
young
manhood
tall
and
exceedingly
well
proportioned
and
as
he
went
forward
along
the
dusty
road
he
bore
himself
with
the
unconscious
air
of
one
more
accustomed
to
crowded
streets
than
to
that
rude
and
unpaved
highway
his
clothing
bore
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
a
tailor
of
rank
his
person
was
groomed
with
that
nicety
of
detail
that
is
permitted
only
to
those
who
possess
both
means
and
leisure
as
well
as
taste
it
was
evident
too
from
his
movement
and
bearing
that
he
had
not
sought
the
atmosphere
of
prescott
with
the
hope
that
it
holds
out
to
those
in
need
of
health
but
still
there
was
a
something
about
him
that
suggested
a
lack
of
the
manly
vigor
and
strength
that
should
have
been
his
a
student
of
men
would
have
said
that
nature
made
this
man
to
be
in
physical
strength
and
spiritual
prowess
a
comrade
and
leader
of
men
a
man
man
a
man
among
men
the
same
student
looking
more
closely
might
have
added
that
in
some
way
through
some
cruel
trick
of
fortune
this
man
had
been
cheated
of
his
birthright
the
day
was
still
young
when
the
stranger
gained
the
top
of
the
first
hill
where
the
road
turns
to
make
its
steep
and
winding
way
down
through
scattered
pines
and
scrub
oak
to
the
burnt
ranch
behind
him
the
little
city
so
picturesque
in
its
mountain
basin
with
the
wild
unfenced
land
coming
down
to
its
very
dooryards
was
slowly
awakening
after
the
last
mad
night
of
its
celebration
the
tents
of
the
tawdry
shows
that
had
tempted
the
crowds
with
vulgar
indecencies
and
the
booths
that
had
sheltered
the
petty
games
of
chance
where
criers
had
persuaded
the
multitude
with
the
hope
of
winning
a
worthless
bauble
or
a
tinsel
toy
were
being
cleared
away
from
the
borders
of
the
plaza
the
beauty
of
which
their
presence
had
marred
in
the
plaza
itself
which
is
the
heart
of
the
town
and
is
usually
kept
with
much
pride
and
care
the
bronze
statue
of
the
vigorous
rough
rider
bucky
and
his
spirited
charger
seemed
pathetically
out
of
place
among
the
litter
of
colored
confetti
and
exploded
fireworks
and
the
refuse
from
various
treats
and
lunches
left
by
the
celebrating
citizens
and
their
guests
the
flags
and
bunting
that
from
window
and
roof
and
pole
and
doorway
had
given
the
day
its
gay
note
of
color
hung
faded
and
listless
as
though
spent
with
their
gaiety
and
mutely
conscious
that
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
their
gladness
was
past
they
waited
the
hand
that
would
remove
them
to
the
ash
barrel
and
the
rubbish
heap
pausing
the
man
turned
to
look
back
for
some
minutes
he
stood
as
one
who
while
determined
upon
a
certain
course
yet
hesitates
reluctant
and
regretful
at
the
beginning
of
his
venture
then
he
went
on
walking
with
a
certain
reckless
swing
as
though
in
ignorance
of
that
land
toward
which
he
had
set
his
face
he
still
resolutely
turned
his
back
upon
that
which
lay
behind
it
was
as
though
for
this
man
too
the
gala
day
with
its
tinseled
bravery
and
its
confetti
spirit
was
of
the
past
a
short
way
down
the
hill
the
man
stopped
again
this
time
to
stand
half
turned
with
his
head
in
a
listening
attitude
the
sound
of
a
vehicle
approaching
from
the
way
whence
he
had
come
had
reached
his
ear
as
the
noise
of
wheels
and
hoofs
grew
louder
a
strange
expression
of
mingled
uncertainty
determination
and
something
very
like
fear
came
over
his
face
he
started
forward
hesitated
looked
back
then
turned
doubtfully
toward
the
thinly
wooded
mountain
side
then
with
tardy
decision
he
left
the
road
and
disappeared
behind
a
clump
of
oak
bushes
an
instant
before
a
team
and
buckboard
rounded
the
turn
and
appeared
in
full
view
an
unmistakable
cattleman
and
substantial
was
driving
the
wild
looking
team
beside
him
sat
a
motherly
woman
and
a
little
boy
as
they
passed
the
clump
of
bushes
the
near
horse
of
the
pair
gave
a
catlike
bound
to
the
right
against
his
tracemate
a
second
jump
followed
the
first
with
quickness
and
this
time
the
frightened
animal
was
accompanied
by
his
companion
who
not
knowing
what
it
was
all
about
jumped
on
general
principles
but
quick
as
they
were
the
strength
of
the
driver
skillful
arms
met
their
weight
on
the
reins
and
forced
them
to
keep
the
road
you
blamed
fools
the
driver
chided
as
they
plunged
ahead
been
raised
on
a
cow
ranch
to
get
scared
at
a
calf
in
the
brush
very
slowly
the
stranger
came
from
behind
the
bushes
cautiously
he
returned
to
the
road
his
fine
lips
curled
in
a
curious
mocking
smile
but
it
was
himself
that
he
mocked
for
there
was
a
look
in
his
dark
eyes
that
gave
to
his
naturally
strong
face
an
almost
pathetic
expression
of
and
shame
as
the
pedestrian
crossed
the
creek
at
the
burnt
ranch
joe
conley
leading
a
horse
by
a
riata
which
was
looped
as
it
had
fallen
about
the
animal
neck
came
through
the
big
corral
gate
across
the
road
from
the
house
at
the
barn
joe
disappeared
through
the
small
door
of
the
saddle
room
the
coil
of
the
riata
still
in
his
hand
thus
compelling
his
mount
to
await
his
return
at
sight
of
the
cowboy
the
stranger
again
paused
and
stood
hesitating
in
indecision
but
as
joe
reappeared
from
the
barn
with
bridle
saddle
blanket
and
saddle
in
hand
the
man
went
reluctantly
forward
as
though
prompted
by
some
necessity
good
morning
said
the
stranger
courteously
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
that
fitted
his
dress
and
bearing
while
his
face
was
now
the
carefully
schooled
countenance
of
a
man
and
with
a
quick
estimating
glance
joe
returned
the
stranger
greeting
and
dropping
the
saddle
and
blanket
on
the
ground
approached
his
head
instantly
the
animal
sprang
back
with
head
high
and
eyes
defiant
but
there
was
no
escape
for
the
rawhide
riata
was
still
securely
held
by
his
master
there
was
a
short
sharp
scuffle
that
sent
the
gravel
by
the
roadside
flying
the
controlling
bit
was
between
the
reluctant
teeth
and
the
cowboy
who
had
silently
taken
the
horse
objection
as
a
matter
of
course
adjusted
the
blanket
and
with
the
easy
skill
of
long
practice
swung
the
heavy
saddle
to
its
place
as
the
cowboy
caught
the
dangling
cinch
and
with
a
deft
hand
tucked
the
latigo
strap
through
the
ring
and
drew
it
tight
there
was
a
look
of
almost
pathetic
wistfulness
on
the
watching
stranger
face
a
look
of
wistfulness
and
admiration
and
envy
dropping
the
stirrup
joe
again
faced
the
stranger
this
time
inquiringly
with
that
bold
straightforward
look
so
characteristic
of
his
kind
and
now
when
the
man
spoke
his
voice
had
a
curious
note
as
if
the
speaker
had
lost
a
little
of
his
poise
it
was
almost
a
note
of
apology
and
again
in
his
eyes
there
was
that
pitiful
look
of
and
shame
pardon
me
he
said
but
will
you
tell
me
please
am
i
right
that
this
is
the
road
to
the
williamson
valley
the
stranger
manner
and
voice
were
in
such
contrast
to
his
general
appearance
that
the
cowboy
frankly
looked
his
wonder
as
he
answered
courteously
yes
sir
and
it
will
take
me
direct
to
the
ranch
if
you
keep
straight
ahead
across
the
valley
it
will
if
you
take
the
fork
on
the
ridge
above
the
goat
ranch
it
will
take
you
to
simmons
there
a
road
from
simmons
to
the
on
the
far
side
of
the
valley
though
you
can
see
the
valley
and
the
home
ranch
from
the
top
of
the
divide
thank
you
the
stranger
was
turning
to
go
when
the
man
in
the
blue
jumper
and
fringed
leather
chaps
spoke
again
curiously
the
dean
with
stella
and
little
billy
passed
in
the
buckboard
less
than
an
hour
ago
on
their
way
home
from
the
celebration
funny
they
pick
you
up
if
you
goin
there
the
other
paused
questioningly
the
dean
the
cowboy
smiled
baldwin
the
owner
of
the
you
know
oh
the
stranger
was
clearly
embarrassed
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
that
clump
of
bushes
on
the
mountain
side
joe
loosing
his
riata
from
the
horse
neck
and
coiling
it
carefully
considered
a
moment
then
you
ai
goin
to
walk
to
the
be
you
that
smile
touched
the
man
lips
but
there
was
a
hint
of
decisive
purpose
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
oh
yes
again
the
cowboy
frankly
measured
the
stranger
then
he
moved
toward
the
corral
gate
the
coiled
riata
in
one
hand
the
bridle
rein
in
the
other
i
catch
up
a
horse
for
you
he
said
in
a
tone
as
if
reaching
a
decision
the
other
spoke
hastily
no
no
please
do
trouble
joe
paused
curiously
any
friend
of
baldwin
is
welcome
to
anything
on
the
burnt
ranch
stranger
but
i
ah
i
have
never
met
baldwin
explained
the
other
lamely
oh
that
all
right
returned
the
cowboy
heartily
you
to
an
that
the
same
thing
again
he
started
toward
the
gate
but
i
pardon
me
you
are
very
kind
but
i
i
prefer
to
walk
once
more
joe
halted
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
tanned
and
face
i
suppose
you
know
it
some
walk
he
suggested
doubtfully
as
if
the
man
ignorance
were
the
only
possible
solution
of
his
assertion
so
i
understand
but
it
will
be
good
for
me
really
i
prefer
to
walk
without
a
word
the
cowboy
turned
back
to
his
horse
and
proceeded
methodically
to
tie
the
coiled
riata
in
its
place
on
the
saddle
then
without
a
glance
toward
the
stranger
who
stood
watching
him
in
embarrassed
silence
he
threw
the
bridle
reins
over
his
horse
head
gripped
the
saddle
horn
and
swung
to
his
seat
reining
his
horse
away
from
the
man
beside
the
road
the
stranger
thus
abruptly
dismissed
moved
hurriedly
away
half
way
to
the
creek
the
cowboy
checked
his
horse
and
looked
back
at
the
pedestrian
as
the
latter
was
making
his
way
under
the
pines
and
up
the
hill
when
the
man
had
disappeared
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
cowboy
muttered
a
bewildered
something
and
touching
his
horse
with
the
spurs
loped
away
as
if
dismissing
a
problem
too
complex
for
his
simple
mind
all
that
day
the
stranger
followed
the
dusty
unfenced
road
over
his
head
the
wide
bright
sky
was
without
a
cloud
to
break
its
vast
expanse
on
the
great
open
range
of
mountain
flat
and
valley
the
cattle
lay
quietly
in
the
shade
of
oak
or
walnut
or
cedar
or
with
slow
listless
movement
sought
the
watering
places
to
slake
their
thirst
the
wild
things
retreated
to
their
secret
hiding
places
in
rocky
den
and
leafy
thicket
to
await
the
cool
of
the
evening
hunting
hour
the
very
air
was
motionless
as
if
the
wind
itself
drowsed
indolently
and
alone
in
the
hushed
bigness
of
that
land
the
man
walked
with
his
thoughts
brooding
perhaps
over
whatever
it
was
that
had
so
strangely
placed
him
there
dreaming
it
may
be
over
that
which
might
have
been
or
that
which
yet
might
be
viewing
with
questioning
wondering
eyes
the
mighty
untamed
scenes
that
met
his
eye
on
every
hand
nor
did
anyone
see
him
for
at
every
sound
of
approaching
horse
or
vehicle
he
went
aside
from
the
highway
to
hide
in
the
bushes
or
behind
convenient
rocks
and
always
when
he
came
from
his
hiding
place
to
resume
his
journey
that
odd
smile
of
was
on
his
face
at
noon
he
rested
for
a
little
beside
the
road
while
he
ate
a
meager
sandwich
that
he
took
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
then
he
pushed
on
again
with
grim
determination
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
heart
and
life
of
that
world
which
was
to
him
so
evidently
new
and
strange
the
afternoon
was
well
spent
when
he
made
his
way
wearily
now
with
drooping
shoulders
and
dragging
step
up
the
long
slope
of
the
divide
that
marks
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
range
about
williamson
valley
at
the
summit
where
the
road
turns
sharply
around
a
shoulder
of
the
mountain
and
begins
the
steep
descent
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
he
stopped
his
tired
form
straightened
his
face
lighted
with
a
look
of
wondering
awe
and
an
involuntary
exclamation
came
from
his
lips
as
his
unaccustomed
eyes
swept
the
wide
view
that
lay
from
his
feet
unrolled
before
him
under
that
sky
so
unmatched
in
its
clearness
and
depth
of
color
the
land
lay
in
all
its
variety
of
valley
and
forest
and
mesa
and
mountain
a
scene
unrivaled
in
the
magnificence
and
grandeur
of
its
beauty
miles
upon
miles
in
the
distance
across
those
primeval
reaches
the
faint
blue
peaks
and
domes
and
ridges
of
the
mountains
ranked
an
uncounted
sentinel
host
the
darker
masses
of
the
timbered
hillsides
with
the
varying
shades
of
pine
and
cedar
the
lighter
tints
of
oak
brush
and
chaparral
the
dun
tones
of
the
open
grass
lands
and
the
brighter
note
of
the
valley
meadows
green
were
defined
blended
and
harmonized
by
the
overlying
haze
with
a
delicacy
exquisite
beyond
all
human
power
to
picture
and
in
the
nearer
distances
chief
of
that
army
of
mountain
peaks
and
master
of
the
many
miles
that
lie
within
their
circle
granite
mountain
gray
and
grim
reared
its
mighty
bulk
of
cliff
and
crag
as
if
in
supreme
defiance
of
the
changing
years
or
the
hand
of
humankind
in
the
heart
of
that
beautiful
land
upon
which
from
the
summit
of
the
divide
the
stranger
looked
with
such
rapt
appreciation
lies
williamson
valley
a
natural
meadow
of
lush
dark
green
native
grass
and
had
the
man
eyes
been
trained
to
such
distances
he
might
have
distinguished
in
the
blue
haze
the
red
roofs
of
the
buildings
of
the
ranch
for
some
time
the
man
stood
there
a
lonely
figure
against
the
sky
peculiarly
out
of
place
in
his
careful
garb
of
the
cities
the
schooled
indifference
of
his
face
was
broken
his
and
mockery
were
forgotten
his
dark
eyes
glowed
with
the
fire
of
excited
anticipation
with
hope
and
determined
purpose
then
with
a
quick
movement
as
though
some
ghost
of
the
past
had
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
looked
back
on
the
way
he
had
come
and
the
light
in
his
eyes
went
out
in
the
gloom
of
painful
memories
his
countenance
unguarded
because
of
his
day
of
loneliness
grew
dark
with
sadness
and
shame
it
was
as
though
he
looked
beyond
the
town
he
had
left
that
morning
with
its
litter
and
refuse
of
yesterday
pleasure
to
a
life
and
a
world
of
tawdry
shams
wherein
men
give
themselves
to
win
by
means
fair
or
foul
the
tinsel
baubles
that
are
offered
in
the
world
petty
games
of
chance
and
yet
even
as
he
looked
back
there
was
in
the
man
face
as
much
of
longing
as
of
regret
he
seemed
as
one
who
realizing
that
he
had
reached
a
point
in
his
life
journey
a
divide
as
it
were
from
which
he
could
see
two
ways
was
resolved
to
turn
from
the
path
he
longed
to
follow
and
to
take
the
road
that
appealed
to
him
the
least
as
one
enlisting
to
fight
in
a
just
and
worthy
cause
might
pause
a
moment
before
taking
the
oath
of
service
to
regret
the
ease
and
freedom
he
was
about
to
surrender
so
this
man
paused
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
slowly
at
last
in
weariness
of
body
and
spirit
he
stumbled
a
few
feet
aside
from
the
road
and
sinking
down
upon
a
convenient
rock
gave
himself
again
to
the
contemplation
of
that
scene
which
lay
before
him
and
there
was
that
in
his
movement
now
that
seemed
to
tell
of
one
who
in
the
grip
of
some
bitter
and
disappointing
experience
was
yet
being
forced
by
something
deep
in
his
being
to
reach
out
in
the
strength
of
his
manhood
to
take
that
which
he
had
been
denied
again
the
man
untrained
eyes
had
failed
to
note
that
which
would
have
first
attracted
the
attention
of
one
schooled
in
the
land
that
lay
about
him
he
had
not
seen
a
tiny
moving
speck
on
the
road
over
which
he
had
passed
a
horseman
was
riding
toward
him
chapter
ii
on
the
divide
had
the
man
on
the
divide
noticed
the
approaching
horseman
it
would
have
been
evident
even
to
one
so
unacquainted
with
the
country
as
the
stranger
that
the
rider
belonged
to
that
land
of
riders
while
still
at
a
distance
too
great
for
the
eye
to
distinguish
the
details
of
fringed
leather
chaps
soft
shirt
short
jumper
sombrero
spurs
and
riata
no
one
could
have
mistaken
the
ease
and
grace
of
the
cowboy
who
seemed
so
literally
a
part
of
his
horse
his
seat
in
the
saddle
was
so
secure
so
easy
and
his
bearing
so
unaffected
and
natural
that
every
movement
of
the
powerful
animal
he
rode
expressed
itself
rhythmically
in
his
own
lithe
and
sinewy
body
while
the
stranger
sat
wrapped
in
meditative
thought
unheeding
the
approach
of
the
rider
the
horseman
coming
on
with
a
long
swinging
lope
watched
the
motionless
figure
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
with
careful
interest
as
he
drew
nearer
the
cowboy
pulled
his
horse
down
to
a
walk
and
from
under
his
broad
hat
brim
regarded
the
stranger
intently
he
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
point
where
the
man
sat
when
the
latter
caught
the
sound
of
the
horse
feet
and
with
a
quick
startled
look
over
his
shoulder
sprang
up
and
started
as
if
to
escape
but
it
was
too
late
and
as
though
on
second
thought
he
whirled
about
with
a
half
defiant
air
to
face
the
intruder
the
horseman
stopped
he
had
not
missed
the
significance
of
that
hurried
movement
and
his
right
hand
rested
carelessly
on
his
leather
clad
thigh
while
his
grey
eyes
were
fixed
boldly
inquiringly
almost
challengingly
on
the
man
he
had
so
unintentionally
surprised
as
he
sat
there
on
his
horse
so
alert
so
ready
in
his
cowboy
garb
and
trappings
against
the
background
of
granite
mountain
with
all
its
rugged
primeval
strength
the
rider
made
a
striking
picture
of
virile
manhood
of
some
years
less
than
thirty
he
was
perhaps
neither
as
tall
nor
as
heavy
as
the
stranger
but
in
spite
of
a
certain
boyish
look
on
his
face
he
bore
himself
with
the
unmistakable
air
of
a
matured
and
man
every
nerve
and
fiber
of
him
seemed
alive
with
that
vital
energy
which
is
the
true
beauty
and
the
glory
of
life
the
two
men
presented
a
striking
contrast
without
question
one
was
the
proud
and
finished
product
of
our
most
advanced
civilization
it
was
as
evident
that
the
splendid
manhood
of
the
other
had
never
been
dwarfed
by
the
weakening
atmosphere
of
an
too
conventional
and
too
complex
environment
the
stranger
with
his
carefully
tailored
clothing
and
his
face
and
bearing
was
as
unlike
this
rider
of
the
unfenced
lands
as
a
daintily
groomed
thoroughbred
from
the
sheltered
and
guarded
stables
of
fashion
is
unlike
a
wild
untamed
stallion
from
the
hills
and
ranges
about
granite
mountain
yet
unlike
as
they
were
there
was
a
something
that
marked
them
as
kin
the
man
of
the
ranges
and
the
man
of
the
cities
were
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
their
beings
as
like
as
the
spirited
thoroughbred
and
the
unbroken
wild
horse
the
cowboy
was
all
that
the
stranger
might
have
been
the
stranger
was
all
that
the
cowboy
under
like
conditions
would
have
been
as
they
silently
faced
each
other
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
each
instinctively
recognized
this
kinship
then
into
the
dark
eyes
of
the
stranger
as
when
he
had
watched
the
cowboy
at
the
burnt
ranch
there
came
that
look
of
wistful
admiration
and
envy
and
at
this
as
if
the
man
had
somehow
made
himself
known
the
horseman
relaxed
his
attitude
of
tense
readiness
the
hand
that
had
held
the
bridle
rein
to
command
instant
action
of
his
horse
and
the
hand
that
had
rested
so
near
the
rider
hip
came
together
on
the
saddle
horn
in
careless
ease
while
a
boyish
smile
of
amusement
broke
over
the
young
man
face
that
smile
brought
a
flash
of
resentment
into
the
eyes
of
the
other
and
a
flush
of
red
darkened
his
untanned
cheeks
a
moment
he
stood
then
with
an
air
of
haughty
rebuke
he
deliberately
turned
his
back
and
seating
himself
again
looked
away
over
the
landscape
but
the
smiling
cowboy
did
not
move
for
a
moment
as
he
regarded
the
stranger
his
shoulders
shook
with
silent
contemptuous
laughter
then
his
face
became
grave
and
he
looked
a
little
ashamed
the
minutes
passed
and
still
he
sat
there
quietly
waiting
presently
as
if
yielding
to
the
persistent
silent
presence
of
the
horseman
and
submitting
reluctantly
to
the
intrusion
the
other
turned
and
again
the
two
who
were
so
like
and
yet
so
unlike
faced
each
other
it
was
the
stranger
now
who
smiled
but
it
was
a
smile
that
caused
the
cowboy
to
become
on
the
instant
kindly
considerate
perhaps
he
remembered
one
of
the
dean
favorite
sayings
keep
your
eye
on
the
man
who
laughs
when
he
hurt
good
evening
said
the
stranger
doubtfully
but
with
a
hint
of
conscious
superiority
in
his
manner
howdy
returned
the
cowboy
heartily
and
in
his
deep
voice
was
the
kindliness
that
made
him
so
loved
by
all
who
knew
him
been
having
some
trouble
if
i
have
it
is
my
own
sir
retorted
the
other
coldly
sure
returned
the
horseman
gently
and
you
welcome
to
it
every
man
has
all
he
needs
of
his
own
i
reckon
but
i
did
mean
it
that
way
i
meant
your
horse
the
stranger
looked
at
him
questioningly
beg
pardon
he
said
what
i
do
not
understand
your
horse
where
is
your
horse
oh
yes
certainly
of
course
my
horse
how
stupid
of
me
the
tone
of
the
man
answer
was
one
of
half
apology
and
he
was
smiling
whimsically
now
as
if
at
his
own
predicament
as
he
continued
i
have
no
horse
really
you
know
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
one
if
i
had
it
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
drifted
all
the
way
out
here
from
prescott
on
foot
exclaimed
the
astonished
cowboy
the
man
on
the
ground
looked
up
at
the
horseman
and
in
a
droll
tone
that
made
the
rider
his
friend
said
while
he
stretched
his
long
legs
painfully
i
like
to
walk
you
see
i
ah
fancied
it
would
be
good
for
me
do
you
know
the
cowboy
laughingly
considered
trying
as
he
said
afterward
to
figure
it
out
it
was
clear
that
this
tall
stranger
was
not
in
search
of
health
nor
did
he
show
any
of
the
distinguishing
marks
of
the
tourist
he
certainly
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
means
he
could
not
be
looking
for
work
he
did
not
seem
a
suspicious
character
quite
the
contrary
and
yet
there
was
that
significant
hurried
movement
as
if
to
escape
when
the
horseman
had
surprised
him
the
etiquette
of
the
country
forbade
a
direct
question
but
yes
he
agreed
thoughtfully
walking
comes
in
handy
sometimes
i
do
take
to
it
much
myself
though
then
he
added
shrewdly
you
were
at
the
celebration
i
reckon
the
stranger
voice
betrayed
quick
enthusiasm
but
that
odd
wistfulness
crept
into
his
eyes
again
and
he
seemed
to
lose
a
little
of
his
poise
indeed
i
was
he
said
i
never
saw
anything
to
compare
with
it
seen
all
kinds
of
athletic
sports
and
contests
and
exhibitions
with
circus
performances
and
riding
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
and
i
read
about
such
things
of
course
but
and
his
voice
grew
thoughtful
that
men
ever
actually
did
them
and
all
in
the
work
as
you
may
say
i
i
never
dreamed
that
there
men
like
that
in
these
days
the
cowboy
shifted
his
weight
uneasily
in
the
saddle
while
he
regarded
the
man
on
the
ground
curiously
she
was
sure
a
humdinger
of
a
celebration
he
admitted
but
as
for
the
show
part
i
seen
things
happen
when
nobody
was
thinking
anything
about
it
that
would
make
those
stunts
at
prescott
look
funny
the
horse
racing
was
pretty
good
though
he
finished
with
suggestive
emphasis
the
other
did
not
miss
the
point
of
the
suggestion
i
did
bet
on
anything
he
laughed
it
funny
nobody
picked
you
up
on
the
road
out
here
the
cowboy
next
offered
pointedly
the
folks
started
home
early
this
morning
and
jim
reid
and
his
family
passed
me
about
an
hour
ago
they
were
in
an
automobile
the
simmons
stage
must
have
caught
up
with
you
somewhere
the
stranger
face
flushed
and
he
seemed
trying
to
find
some
answer
the
cowboy
watched
him
curiously
then
in
a
musing
tone
added
the
suggestion
some
lonesome
up
here
on
foot
but
there
are
times
you
know
returned
the
other
desperately
when
a
man
prefers
to
be
alone
the
cowboy
straightened
in
his
saddle
and
lifted
his
reins
thanks
he
said
dryly
i
reckon
i
better
be
moving
but
the
other
spoke
quickly
i
beg
your
pardon
acton
i
did
not
mean
that
for
you
the
horseman
dropped
his
hands
again
to
the
saddle
horn
and
resumed
his
lounging
posture
thus
tacitly
accepting
the
apology
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
he
said
the
stranger
laughed
everyone
knows
that
horse
phil
of
the
ranch
won
the
championship
yesterday
i
saw
you
ride
philip
acton
face
showed
boyish
embarrassment
the
other
continued
with
his
strange
enthusiasm
it
was
great
work
wonderful
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
there
was
no
mistaking
the
genuineness
of
his
admiration
nor
could
he
hide
that
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
shucks
said
the
cowboy
uneasily
i
could
pick
a
dozen
of
the
boys
in
that
outfit
who
can
ride
all
around
me
it
was
just
my
luck
all
i
happened
to
draw
an
easy
one
easy
ejaculated
the
stranger
seeing
again
in
his
mind
the
fighting
plunging
maddened
outlawed
brute
that
this
man
had
mastered
and
i
suppose
catching
and
throwing
those
steers
was
easy
too
the
cowboy
was
plainly
wondering
at
the
man
peculiar
enthusiasm
for
these
most
commonplace
things
the
roping
why
that
was
no
more
than
we
doing
all
the
time
i
do
mean
the
roping
returned
the
other
i
mean
when
you
rode
up
beside
one
of
those
steers
that
was
running
at
full
speed
and
caught
him
by
the
horns
with
your
bare
hands
and
jumped
from
your
saddle
and
threw
the
beast
over
you
and
then
lay
there
with
his
horns
pinning
you
down
you
are
doing
that
all
the
time
are
you
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
such
things
as
that
are
a
part
of
your
everyday
work
oh
the
bull
doggin
why
no
admitted
phil
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
that
was
just
fun
you
know
the
stranger
stared
at
him
speechless
fun
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
most
modern
in
civilization
what
manner
of
men
were
these
who
did
such
things
in
fun
if
this
was
their
recreation
what
must
their
work
be
do
you
mind
my
asking
he
said
wistfully
how
you
learned
to
do
such
things
why
i
do
know
we
just
do
them
i
reckon
and
could
anyone
learn
to
ride
as
you
ride
do
you
think
the
question
came
with
marked
eagerness
i
do
see
why
not
answered
the
cowboy
honestly
the
stranger
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
looked
away
over
the
wild
land
where
the
shadows
of
the
late
afternoon
were
lengthening
where
are
you
going
to
stop
phil
acton
asked
suddenly
the
stranger
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
view
that
seemed
to
hold
for
him
such
peculiar
interest
really
he
answered
indifferently
i
had
not
thought
of
that
i
should
think
you
be
thinking
of
it
along
about
supper
time
if
you
walked
from
town
since
morning
the
stranger
looked
up
with
sudden
interest
but
the
cowboy
fancied
that
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
under
the
droll
tone
of
his
reply
do
you
know
acton
i
have
never
been
really
hungry
in
my
life
it
might
be
interesting
to
try
it
once
do
you
think
phil
acton
laughed
as
he
returned
it
might
be
interesting
all
right
but
i
think
i
better
tell
you
just
the
same
that
there
a
ranch
down
yonder
in
the
timber
it
nothing
but
a
goat
ranch
but
i
reckon
they
would
take
you
in
it
too
far
to
the
for
me
to
ask
you
there
you
can
see
the
buildings
though
from
here
the
stranger
sprang
up
in
quick
interest
you
can
the
ranch
sure
the
cowboy
smiled
and
pointed
into
the
distance
those
red
spots
over
there
are
the
roofs
jim
reid
place
the
is
just
this
side
of
the
meadows
and
a
little
to
the
south
the
old
acton
homestead
where
i
was
born
is
in
that
bunch
of
cottonwoods
across
the
wash
from
the
but
strive
as
he
might
the
stranger
eyes
could
discern
no
sign
of
human
habitation
in
those
vast
reaches
that
lay
before
him
if
you
are
ever
over
that
way
drop
in
said
phil
cordially
baldwin
will
be
glad
to
meet
you
do
you
really
mean
that
questioned
the
other
doubtfully
we
do
say
such
things
in
this
country
if
we
do
mean
them
stranger
was
the
cool
retort
of
course
i
beg
your
pardon
acton
came
the
confused
reply
i
should
like
to
see
the
ranch
i
may
i
will
that
is
if
i
he
stopped
as
if
not
knowing
how
to
finish
and
with
a
gesture
of
hopelessness
turned
away
to
stand
silently
looking
back
toward
the
town
while
his
face
was
dark
with
painful
memories
and
his
lips
curved
in
that
mirthless
smile
and
philip
acton
seeing
felt
suddenly
that
he
had
rudely
intruded
upon
the
privacy
of
one
who
had
sought
the
solitude
of
that
lonely
place
to
hide
the
hurt
of
some
bitter
experience
a
certain
native
gentleness
made
the
man
of
the
ranges
understand
that
this
stranger
was
face
to
face
with
some
crisis
in
his
life
that
he
was
passing
through
one
of
those
trials
through
which
a
man
must
pass
alone
had
it
been
possible
the
cowboy
would
have
apologized
but
that
would
have
been
an
added
unkindness
lifting
the
reins
and
sitting
erect
in
the
saddle
he
said
indifferently
well
i
must
be
moving
i
take
a
short
cut
here
so
long
better
make
it
on
down
to
the
goat
ranch
it
not
far
he
touched
his
horse
with
the
spur
and
the
animal
sprang
away
called
the
stranger
and
that
wistful
look
was
in
his
eyes
as
the
rider
swung
his
horse
aside
from
the
road
plunged
down
the
mountain
side
and
dashed
away
through
the
brush
and
over
the
rocks
with
reckless
speed
with
a
low
exclamation
of
wondering
admiration
the
man
climbed
hastily
to
a
higher
point
and
from
there
watched
until
horse
and
rider
taking
a
steeper
declivity
without
checking
their
breakneck
course
dropped
from
sight
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
faint
sound
of
the
sliding
rocks
and
gravel
dislodged
by
the
flying
feet
died
away
the
cloud
of
dust
dissolved
in
the
thin
air
the
stranger
looked
away
into
the
blue
distance
in
another
vain
attempt
to
see
the
red
spots
that
marked
the
ranch
slowly
the
man
returned
to
his
seat
on
the
rock
the
long
shadows
of
granite
mountain
crept
out
from
the
base
of
the
cliffs
farther
and
farther
over
the
country
below
the
blue
of
the
distant
hills
changed
to
mauve
with
deeper
masses
of
purple
in
the
shadows
where
the
canyons
are
the
lonely
figure
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
did
not
move
the
sun
hid
itself
behind
the
line
of
mountains
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
in
the
west
changed
slowly
to
gold
against
which
the
peaks
and
domes
and
points
were
silhouetted
as
if
cut
by
a
graver
tool
and
the
bold
cliffs
and
battlements
of
old
granite
grew
coldly
gray
in
the
gloom
as
the
night
came
on
and
the
details
of
its
structure
were
lost
the
mountain
to
the
watching
man
on
the
divide
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
mighty
fortress
a
fortress
he
thought
to
which
a
generation
of
men
might
retreat
from
a
civilization
that
threatened
them
with
destruction
and
once
more
the
man
faced
back
the
way
he
had
come
the
cities
were
already
in
the
blaze
of
their
own
artificial
lights
lights
valued
not
for
their
power
to
make
men
see
but
for
their
power
to
dazzle
attract
and
intoxicate
lights
that
permitted
no
kindly
dusk
at
eventide
wherein
a
man
might
rest
from
his
day
work
a
quiet
hour
lights
that
revealed
squalid
shame
and
tinsel
show
lights
that
hid
the
stars
the
man
on
the
divide
lifted
his
face
to
the
stars
that
now
in
the
sky
were
gathering
in
such
unnumbered
multitudes
to
keep
their
sentinel
watch
over
the
world
below
the
cool
evening
wind
came
whispering
over
the
lonely
land
and
all
the
furred
and
winged
creatures
of
the
night
stole
from
their
dark
hiding
places
into
the
gloom
which
is
the
beginning
of
their
day
a
coyote
crept
stealthily
past
in
the
dark
and
from
the
mountain
side
below
came
the
weird
ghostly
call
of
its
mate
an
owl
drifted
by
on
silent
wings
night
birds
chirped
in
the
chaparral
a
fox
barked
on
the
ridge
above
the
shadowy
form
of
a
bat
flitted
here
and
there
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
bull
bellowed
his
challenge
suddenly
the
man
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
sprang
to
his
feet
and
with
a
gesture
that
had
he
not
been
so
alone
might
have
seemed
affectedly
dramatic
stretched
out
his
arms
in
an
attitude
of
wistful
longing
while
his
lips
moved
as
if
again
and
again
he
whispered
a
name

the

it
is
called
in

the

are
well
over
by
the

during
the
long
summer
weeks
until
the
beginning

in

there
is

for

doctor
such
animals
as
are
afflicted
with
screwworms
it
is
during
these
weeks
too
that
the
horses
are
broken
for
with
the
hard
and
dangerous
work
of
the
fall
and
spring
months
there
is
always
need
for
fresh
mounts
the
horses
of
the
were
never
permitted
to
run
on
the
open
range
because
the
leaders
of
the
numerous
bands
of
wild
horses
that
roamed
over
the
country
about
granite
mountain
were
always
ambitious
to
gain
recruits
for
their
harems
from
their
civilized
neighbors
the
freedom
of
the
ranch
horses
was
limited
by
the
fences
of
a
pasture
but
within
these
miles
of
barbed
wire
boundaries
the
brood
mares
with
their
growing
progeny
lived
as
free
and
untamed
as
their
wild
cousins
on
the
unfenced
lands
about
them
the
colts
except
for
one
painful
experience
when
they
were
roped
and
branded
from
the
day
of
their
birth
until
they
were
ready
to
be
broken
were
never
handled
on
the
morning
following
his
meeting
with
the
stranger
on
the
divide
phil
acton
with
two
of
his
cowboy
helpers
rode
out
to
the
big
pasture
to
bring
in
the
band
the
owner
of
the
always
declared
that
phil
was
intimately
acquainted
with
every
individual
horse
and
head
of
stock
between
the
divide
and
camp
wood
mountain
and
from
skull
valley
to
the
big
chino
in
moments
of
enthusiasm
the
dean
even
maintained
stoutly
that
his
young
foreman
knew
as
well
every
coyote
fox
badger
deer
antelope
mountain
lion
bobcat
and
wild
horse
that
had
home
or
hunting
ground
in
the
country
over
which
the
lad
had
ridden
since
his
babyhood
certain
it
is
that
wild
horse
phil
as
he
was
called
by
admiring
friends
for
reasons
which
you
shall
hear
loved
this
work
and
life
to
which
he
was
born
every
feature
of
that
wild
land
from
lonely
mountain
peak
to
hidden
canyon
spring
was
as
familiar
to
him
as
the
streets
and
buildings
of
a
man
home
city
are
well
known
to
the
one
reared
among
them
and
as
he
rode
that
morning
with
his
comrades
to
the
day
work
the
young
man
felt
keenly
the
call
of
the
primitive
unspoiled
life
that
throbbed
with
such
vital
strength
about
him
he
could
not
have
put
that
which
he
felt
into
words
he
was
not
even
conscious
of
the
forces
that
so
moved
him
he
only
knew
that
he
was
glad
the
days
of
the
celebration
at
prescott
had
been
enjoyable
days
to
meet
old
friends
and
comrades
to
ride
with
them
in
the
contests
that
all
true
men
of
his
kind
love
to
compare
experiences
and
exchange
news
and
gossip
with
widely
separated
neighbors
had
been
a
pleasure
but
the
curious
crowds
of
strangers
the
throngs
of
sightseers
from
the
to
him
unknown
world
of
cities
who
had
regarded
him
as
they
might
have
viewed
some
rare
and
creature
in
a
menagerie
and
the
brazen
presence
of
those
unclean
parasites
and
harpies
that
prey
always
upon
such
occasions
had
oppressed
and
disgusted
him
until
he
was
glad
to
escape
again
to
the
clean
freedom
the
pure
vitality
and
the
unspoiled
spirit
of
his
everyday
life
and
environment
in
an
overflow
of
sheer
physical
and
spiritual
energy
he
lifted
his
horse
into
a
run
and
with
a
shrill
cowboy
yell
challenged
his
companions
to
a
wild
race
to
the
pasture
gate
it
was
some
time
after
noon
when
phil
checked
his
horse
near
the
ruins
of
an
old
indian
lookout
on
the
top
of
black
hill
below
in
the
open
land
above
deep
wash
he
could
see
his
cowboy
companions
working
the
band
of
horses
that
had
been
gathered
slowly
toward
the
narrow
pass
that
at
the
eastern
end
of
black
hill
leads
through
to
the
flats
at
the
upper
end
of
the
big
meadows
and
so
to
the
gate
and
to
the
way
they
would
follow
to
the
corral
it
was
phil
purpose
to
ride
across
black
hill
down
the
western
and
northern
slope
through
the
cedar
timber
and
picking
up
any
horses
that
might
be
ranging
there
join
the
others
at
the
gate
in
the
meanwhile
there
was
time
for
a
few
minutes
rest
dismounting
he
loosed
the
girths
and
lifted
saddle
and
blanket
from
hobson
steaming
back
then
while
the
good
horse
wearied
with
the
hard
riding
and
the
steep
climb
up
the
mountain
side
stood
quietly
in
the
shade
of
a
cedar
his
master
stretched
on
the
ground
near
by
idly
scanned
the
world
that
lay
below
and
about
them
very
clearly
in
that
light
atmosphere
phil
could
see
the
trees
and
buildings
of
the
home
ranch
and
just
across
the
sandy
wash
from
the
the
grove
of
cottonwoods
and
walnuts
that
hid
the
little
old
house
where
he
was
born
a
mile
away
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
great
valley
meadows
he
could
see
the
home
buildings
of
the
reid
ranch
the
where
kitty
reid
had
lived
all
the
days
of
her
life
except
those
three
years
which
she
had
spent
at
school
in
the
east
the
young
man
on
the
top
of
black
hill
looked
long
at
the
reid
home
in
his
mind
he
could
see
kitty
dressed
in
some
cool
simple
gown
fresh
and
dainty
after
the
morning
housework
sitting
with
book
or
sewing
on
the
front
porch
the
porch
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
it
is
true
and
the
distance
was
too
great
for
him
to
distinguish
a
person
in
any
case
but
all
that
made
no
difference
to
phil
vision
he
could
see
her
just
the
same
kitty
had
been
very
kind
to
phil
at
the
celebration
but
kitty
was
always
kind
nearly
always
but
in
spite
of
her
kindness
the
cowboy
felt
that
she
had
not
somehow
seemed
to
place
a
very
high
valuation
upon
the
medal
he
had
won
in
the
contest
phil
himself
did
not
greatly
value
the
medal
but
he
had
wanted
greatly
to
win
that
championship
because
of
the
very
substantial
money
prize
that
went
with
it
that
money
in
phil
mind
was
to
play
a
very
important
part
in
a
long
cherished
dream
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
phil
acton
did
not
talk
about
he
had
not
in
fact
ridden
for
the
championship
at
all
but
for
his
dream
and
that
was
why
it
mattered
so
much
when
kitty
seemed
so
to
lack
interest
in
his
success
as
though
his
subconscious
mind
directed
the
movement
the
young
man
looked
away
from
kitty
home
to
the
distant
mountain
ridge
where
the
night
before
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
he
had
met
the
stranger
all
the
way
home
the
cowboy
had
wondered
about
the
man
evolving
many
theories
inventing
many
things
to
account
for
his
presence
alone
and
on
foot
so
far
from
the
surroundings
to
which
he
was
so
clearly
accustomed
of
one
thing
phil
was
sure
the
man
was
in
trouble
deep
trouble
the
more
that
the
lad
of
the
great
thought
about
it
the
more
strongly
he
felt
that
he
had
unwittingly
intruded
at
a
moment
that
was
sacred
to
the
stranger
sacred
because
the
man
was
fighting
one
of
those
battles
that
every
man
must
fight
and
fight
alone
it
was
this
feeling
that
had
kept
the
young
man
from
speaking
of
the
incident
to
anyone
even
to
the
dean
or
to
mother
as
he
called
baldwin
perhaps
too
this
feeling
was
the
real
reason
for
phil
sense
of
kinship
with
the
stranger
for
the
cowboy
himself
had
moments
in
his
life
that
he
could
permit
no
man
to
look
upon
but
in
his
thinking
of
the
man
whose
personality
had
so
impressed
him
one
thing
stood
out
above
all
the
rest
the
stranger
clearly
belonged
to
that
world
of
which
from
experience
the
young
foreman
of
the
knew
nothing
phil
acton
had
no
desire
for
the
world
to
which
the
stranger
belonged
but
in
his
heart
there
was
a
troublesome
question
if
if
he
himself
were
more
like
the
man
whom
he
had
met
on
the
divide
if
if
he
knew
more
of
that
other
world
if
he
in
some
degree
belonged
to
that
other
world
as
kitty
because
of
her
three
years
in
school
belonged
would
it
make
any
difference
from
the
distant
mountain
ridge
that
marks
the
eastern
limits
of
the
williamson
valley
country
and
thus
in
a
degree
marked
the
limit
of
phil
world
the
lad
gaze
turned
again
to
the
scene
immediately
before
him
the
band
of
horses
followed
by
the
cowboys
were
trotting
from
the
narrow
pass
out
into
the
open
flats
some
of
the
band
the
mothers
went
quietly
knowing
from
past
experience
that
they
would
in
a
few
hours
be
returned
to
their
freedom
others
the
colts
and
yearlings
bewildered
curious
and
fearful
followed
their
mothers
without
protest
but
those
who
in
many
a
friendly
race
or
primitive
battle
had
proved
their
growing
years
seemed
to
sense
a
coming
crisis
in
their
lives
hitherto
peaceful
and
these
as
though
warned
by
that
strange
instinct
which
guards
all
wild
things
and
realizing
that
the
open
ground
between
the
pass
and
the
gate
presented
their
last
opportunity
made
final
desperate
efforts
to
escape
with
sudden
dashes
dodging
and
doubling
they
tried
again
and
again
for
freedom
but
always
between
them
and
the
haunts
they
loved
there
was
a
persistent
horseman
running
leaping
whirling
in
their
efforts
to
be
everywhere
at
once
the
riders
worked
their
charges
toward
the
gate
the
man
on
the
hilltop
sprang
to
his
feet
hobson
threw
up
his
head
and
with
sharp
ears
forward
eagerly
watched
the
game
he
knew
so
well
with
a
quickness
incredible
to
the
uninitiated
phil
threw
blanket
and
saddle
to
place
as
he
drew
the
cinch
tight
a
shrill
cowboy
yell
came
up
from
the
flat
below
one
of
the
band
a
powerful
bay
had
broken
past
the
guarding
horsemen
and
was
running
with
every
ounce
of
his
strength
for
the
timber
on
the
western
slope
of
black
hill
for
a
hundred
yards
one
of
the
riders
had
tried
to
overtake
and
turn
the
fugitive
but
as
he
saw
how
the
stride
of
the
free
horse
was
widening
the
distance
between
them
the
cowboy
turned
back
lest
others
follow
the
successful
runaway
example
the
yell
was
to
inform
phil
of
the
situation
before
the
echoes
of
the
signal
could
die
away
phil
was
in
the
saddle
and
with
an
answering
shout
sent
hobson
down
the
rough
mountain
side
in
a
wild
reckless
plunging
run
to
head
the
for
the
moment
victorious
bay
an
hour
later
the
foreman
rejoined
his
companions
who
were
holding
the
band
of
horses
at
the
gate
the
big
bay
reluctant
protesting
twisting
and
turning
in
vain
attempts
to
outmaneuver
hobson
was
a
captive
in
the
loop
of
wild
horse
phil
riata
in
the
big
corral
that
afternoon
phil
and
his
helpers
with
the
dean
and
little
billy
looking
on
cut
out
from
the
herd
the
horses
selected
to
be
broken
these
one
by
one
were
forced
through
the
gate
into
the
adjoining
corral
from
which
they
watched
with
uneasy
wonder
and
many
excited
and
ineffectual
attempts
to
follow
when
their
more
fortunate
companions
were
driven
again
to
the
big
pasture
then
phil
opened
another
gate
and
the
little
band
dashed
wildly
through
to
find
themselves
in
the
small
meadow
pasture
where
they
would
pass
the
last
night
before
the
one
great
battle
of
their
lives
a
battle
that
would
be
for
them
a
dividing
point
between
those
years
of
ease
and
freedom
which
had
been
theirs
from
birth
and
the
years
of
hard
and
useful
service
that
were
to
come
phil
sat
on
his
horse
at
the
gate
watching
with
critical
eye
as
the
unbroken
animals
raced
away
some
good
ones
in
the
bunch
this
year
uncle
will
he
commented
to
his
employer
who
standing
on
the
watering
trough
in
the
other
corral
was
looking
over
the
fence
there
bound
to
be
some
good
ones
in
every
bunch
returned
baldwin
and
some
no
account
ones
too
he
added
as
his
foreman
dismounted
beside
him
then
while
the
young
man
slipped
the
bridle
from
his
horse
and
stood
waiting
for
the
animal
to
drink
the
older
man
regarded
him
silently
as
though
in
his
own
mind
the
dean
observation
bore
somewhat
upon
phil
himself
that
was
always
the
way
with
the
dean
as
sheriff
fellows
once
remarked
to
judge
powell
in
the
old
days
of
the
cattle
rustlers
glory
whatever
bill
baldwin
says
is
mighty
nigh
always
there
are
also
two
sides
to
the
dean
or
rather
to
be
accurate
there
is
a
front
and
a
back
the
back
flat
and
straight
and
broad
indicates
one
side
of
his
character
the
side
that
belongs
with
the
square
chin
and
the
blue
eyes
that
always
look
at
you
with
such
frank
directness
it
was
this
side
of
the
man
that
brought
him
barefooted
and
penniless
to
arizona
in
those
days
long
gone
when
he
was
only
a
boy
and
arizona
a
strong
man
country
it
was
this
side
of
him
that
brought
him
triumphantly
through
those
hard
years
of
the
indian
troubles
and
in
those
wild
and
lawless
times
made
him
respected
and
feared
by
the
evildoers
and
trusted
and
followed
by
those
of
his
kind
who
out
of
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
those
turbulent
days
made
the
arizona
of
it
was
this
side
too
that
finally
made
the
barefoot
penniless
boy
the
owner
of
the
ranch
i
do
not
know
the
exact
number
of
the
dean
years
i
only
know
that
his
hair
is
grey
and
that
he
does
not
ride
as
much
as
he
once
did
i
have
heard
him
say
though
that
for
years
he
lived
in
the
saddle
and
that
the
brand
is
one
of
the
oldest
irons
in
the
state
and
i
know
too
that
his
back
is
still
flat
and
broad
and
straight
the
dean
front
so
and
hearty
indicates
as
clearly
the
other
side
of
his
character
and
it
is
this
side
that
belongs
to
the
full
red
cheeks
the
chuckle
or
laugh
that
puts
the
twinkle
in
the
blue
eyes
and
the
kindly
tones
in
his
deep
voice
it
is
this
side
of
the
dean
character
that
adds
so
large
a
measure
of
love
to
the
respect
and
confidence
accorded
him
by
neighbors
and
friends
business
associates
and
employees
it
is
this
side
of
the
dean
too
that
in
these
days
sits
in
the
shade
of
the
big
walnut
trees
planted
by
his
own
hand
and
talks
to
the
youngsters
of
the
days
that
are
gone
and
that
makes
the
young
riders
of
this
generation
seek
him
out
for
counsel
and
sympathy
and
help
three
things
the
dean
knows
cattle
and
horses
and
men
one
thing
the
dean
will
not
can
not
tolerate
weakness
in
one
who
should
be
strong
even
bad
men
he
admires
if
they
are
strong
not
for
their
badness
but
for
their
strength
mistaken
men
he
loves
in
spite
of
their
mistakes
if
only
they
be
not
weaklings
there
is
no
place
anywhere
in
the
philosophy
of
life
for
a
weakling
i
heard
him
tell
a
man
once
nor
shall
i
ever
forget
it
you
had
better
die
like
a
man
sir
than
live
like
a
sneaking
coyote
the
dean
sons
men
grown
were
gone
from
the
home
ranch
to
the
fields
and
work
of
their
choosing
little
billy
a
nephew
of
seven
years
was
as
and
baldwin
said
laughingly
their
second
crop
when
phil
horse
satisfied
lifted
his
dripping
muzzle
from
the
watering
trough
the
dean
walked
with
his
young
foreman
to
the
saddle
shed
neither
of
the
men
spoke
for
between
them
there
was
that
companionship
which
does
not
require
a
constant
flow
of
talk
to
keep
it
alive
not
until
the
cowboy
had
turned
his
horse
loose
and
was
hanging
saddle
and
bridle
on
their
accustomed
peg
did
the
older
man
speak
jim
reid
goin
to
begin
breakin
horses
next
week
so
i
heard
returned
phil
carefully
spreading
his
saddle
blanket
to
dry
the
dean
spoke
again
in
a
tone
of
indifference
he
wants
you
to
help
him
me
what
the
matter
with
jack
he
goin
to
the
phil
was
examining
the
wrapping
on
his
saddle
horn
with
the
dean
noted
quite
unnecessary
care
kitty
was
over
this
mornin
said
the
dean
gently
the
young
man
turned
and
taking
off
his
spurs
hung
them
on
the
saddle
horn
then
as
he
kicked
off
his
leather
chaps
he
said
shortly
i
not
looking
for
a
job
as
a
professional
the
dean
eyes
twinkled
thought
you
might
like
to
help
a
neighbor
out
just
to
be
neighborly
you
know
do
you
want
me
to
ride
for
reid
demanded
phil
well
i
suppose
as
long
as
there
broncs
to
bust
somebody
got
to
bust
the
dean
returned
without
committing
himself
and
then
when
phil
made
no
reply
he
added
laughing
i
told
kitty
to
tell
him
though
that
i
reckoned
you
had
as
big
a
string
as
you
could
handle
here
as
they
moved
away
toward
the
house
phil
returned
with
significant
emphasis
when
i
have
to
ride
for
anybody
besides
you
it
wo
be
kitty
reid
father
and
the
dean
commented
in
his
reflective
tone
it
does
sometimes
seem
to
make
a
difference
who
a
man
rides
for
do
it
in
the
pasture
by
the
corrals
the
horses
that
awaited
the
approaching
trial
that
would
mark
for
them
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
passed
a
restless
night
some
in
meekness
of
spirit
or
perhaps
with
deeper
wisdom
fed
quietly
others
wandered
about
aimlessly
snatching
an
occasional
uneasy
mouthful
of
grass
and
looking
about
often
in
troubled
doubt
the
more
rebellious
ones
followed
the
fence
searching
for
some
place
of
weakness
in
the
barbed
barrier
that
imprisoned
them
and
one
who
had
he
not
been
by
circumstance
robbed
of
his
birthright
would
have
been
the
strong
leader
of
a
wild
band
stood
often
with
wide
nostrils
and
challenging
eye
gazing
toward
the
corrals
and
buildings
as
if
questioning
the
right
of
those
who
had
brought
him
there
from
the
haunts
he
loved
and
somewhere
in
the
night
of
that
land
which
was
as
unknown
to
him
as
the
meadow
pasture
was
strange
to
the
unbroken
horses
a
man
awaited
the
day
which
for
him
too
was
to
stand
through
all
his
remaining
years
as
a
mark
between
the
old
life
and
the
new
as
phil
acton
lay
in
his
bed
with
doors
and
windows
open
wide
to
welcome
the
cool
night
air
he
heard
the
restless
horses
in
the
pasture
and
smiled
as
he
thought
of
the
big
bay
and
the
morrow
smiled
with
the
smile
of
a
man
who
looks
forward
to
a
battle
worthy
of
his
best
strength
and
skill
and
then
strangely
enough
as
he
was
slipping
into
that
dreamless
sleep
of
those
who
live
as
he
lived
his
mind
went
back
again
to
the
stranger
whom
he
had
met
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
if
he
were
more
like
that
man
would
it
make
any
difference
the
cowboy
wondered
chapter
iv
at
the
corral
in
the
beginning
of
the
morning
when
granite
mountain
battlements
and
towers
loomed
gray
and
bold
and
grim
the
big
bay
horse
trumpeted
a
warning
to
his
less
watchful
mates
instantly
with
heads
high
and
eyes
wide
the
band
stood
in
frightened
indecision
two
horsemen
shadowy
and
mysterious
forms
in
the
misty
light
were
riding
from
the
corral
into
the
pasture
as
the
riders
approached
individuals
in
the
band
moved
uneasily
starting
as
if
to
run
hesitating
turning
for
another
look
maneuvering
to
put
their
mates
between
them
and
the
enemy
but
the
bay
went
boldly
a
short
distance
toward
the
danger
and
stood
still
with
wide
nostrils
and
fierce
eyes
as
though
ready
for
the
combat
for
a
few
moments
as
the
horsemen
seemed
about
to
go
past
hope
beat
high
in
the
hearts
of
the
timid
prisoners
then
the
riders
circled
to
put
the
band
between
themselves
and
the
corral
gate
and
the
frightened
animals
knew
but
always
as
they
whirled
and
dodged
in
their
attempts
to
avoid
that
big
gate
toward
which
they
were
forced
to
move
there
was
a
silent
persistent
horseman
barring
the
way
the
big
bay
alone
as
though
realizing
the
futility
of
such
efforts
and
so
conserving
his
strength
for
whatever
was
to
follow
trotted
proudly
boldly
into
the
corral
where
he
stood
his
eyes
never
leaving
the
riders
as
his
mates
crowded
and
jostled
about
him
there
one
in
that
bunch
that
sure
aimin
to
make
you
ride
some
said
curly
elson
with
a
grin
to
phil
as
the
family
sat
at
breakfast
on
the
the
men
who
were
held
through
the
summer
and
winter
seasons
between
the
months
of
the
rodeos
were
considered
members
of
the
family
chosen
for
their
character
as
well
as
for
their
knowledge
of
the
country
and
their
skill
in
their
work
the
dean
and
stella
as
baldwin
is
called
throughout
all
that
country
always
spoke
of
them
affectionately
as
our
boys
and
this
better
than
anything
that
could
be
said
is
an
introduction
to
the
mistress
of
the
household
at
the
challenging
laugh
which
followed
curly
observation
phil
returned
quietly
with
his
sunny
smile
maybe
i
quit
him
before
he
gets
good
and
started
he
sure
fixin
to
make
you
back

up
little
billy
excitedly

phil
embarrassed
at
the
laughter
which
followed

with
tactful
seriousness
to
his
little
champion

right
kid

up
for
your
pardner
every
time

a
little
sorrel
in
that
bunch
that
i
picked

he
glanced
at
his
employer
meaningly
and
the
face
glowed
with
appreciation
of
the
young
man
thoughtfulness
that
old
horse
sheep
of
yours
continued
phil
to
little
billy
is
getting
too
old
and
stiff
for
your
work
i
noticed
him
stumbling
a
lot
lately
again
he
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
dean
who
answered
the
look
with
a
slight
nod
of
approval
you
better
make
him
gentle
your
horse
first
billy
teased
curly
he
might
not
be
in
the
business
when
that
big
one
gets
through
with
him
little
billy
retort
came
in
a
flash
huh

phil
will
be
long
after

got
curly
elson

son
cautioned
the
dean
when
the
laugh
had
gone
round
again
curly

be
slippin
a
burr
under
your
saddle
if
you
do
then
to
the
men
what
horse

goin
to
be
such
a
bad
one
that
big
bay
with
the
blazed
face
the
cowboys
nodded
he
bad
all
right
said
phil
well
commented
the
dean
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
speaking
generally
he
sure
got
a
license
to
be
bad
his
mother
was
the
wickedest
piece
of
horse
flesh
i
ever
knew
remember
her
stella
indeed

do
returned
baldwin
she
nearly
ruined
that
windy
jim
who
came
from
nobody
knew
where
and
bragged
that
he
could
ride
anything
the
dean
chuckled
reminiscently
she
sure
sent
windy
back
where
he
came
from
but
i
tell
you
boys
that
kind
of
a
horse
makes
the
best
in
the
world
once
you

broke
right
horses

just
like
men
anyhow
if
they
ai
got
enough
in
to
fight
when
they

breakin
the
man
that

that
bay
will
sure
be
said
curly
he
a
man
horse
all
right
agreed
bob
breakfast
over
the
men
left
the
house
not
too
quietly
and
laughing
jesting
and
romping
like
school
boys
went
out
to
the
corrals
with
little
billy
tagging
eagerly
at
their
heels
the
dean
and
phil
remained
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
table
you
really
ought
to
say
such
things
to
those
boys
will
reproved
baldwin
as
she
watched
them
from
the
window
it
encourages
them
to
be
wild
and
land
knows
they
do
need
any
encouragement
shucks
returned
the
dean
with
that
gentle
note
that
was
always
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
to
her
if
such
talk
as
that
can
hurt
there
ai
nothin
that
could
save
you
always
afraid
goin
to
go
bad
look
at
me
and
phil
here
he
added
as
they
in
turn
pushed
their
chairs
back
from
the
table
you
fussed
enough
over
us
to
spoil
a
dozen
men
and
ai
we
been
a
credit
to
you
all
the
time
at
this
they
laughed
together
but
as
phil
was
leaving
the
house
baldwin
stopped
him
at
the
door
to
say
earnestly
you
will
be
careful
wo
you
son
you
know
my
other
phil
she
stopped
and
turned
away
the
young
man
knew
that
story
a
story
common
to
that
land
where
the
lives
of
men
are
not
infrequently
offered
a
sacrifice
to
the
untamed
strength
of
the
life
that
in
many
forms
they
are
daily
called
upon
to
meet
and
master
never
mind
mother
he
said
gently
i
be
all
right
then
more
lightly
he
added
with
his
sunny
smile
if
that
big
bay
starts
anything
with
me
i
climb
the
corral
fence
pronto
quietly
as
one
who
faces
a
hard
day
work
phil
went
to
the
saddle
shed
where
he
buckled
on
chaps
and
spurs
then
after
looking
carefully
to
stirrup
leathers
cinch
and
latigos
he
went
on
to
the
corrals
the
heavy
saddle
under
his
arm
curly
and
bob
their
horses
saddled
and
ready
were
making
animated
targets
of
themselves
for
little
billy
who
mounted
on
sheep
a
gentle
old
was
whirling
a
miniature
riata
as
the
foreman
appeared
the
cowboys
dropped
their
fun
and
mounting
took
the
coils
of
their
own
rawhide
ropes
in
hand
which
one
will
you
have
first
phil
asked
curly
as
he
moved
toward
the
gate
between
the
big
corral
and
the
smaller
enclosure
that
held
the
band
of
horses
that
black
one
with
the
white
star
will
do
directed
phil
quietly
then
to
little
billy
you
better
get
back
there
out
of
the
way
pardner
that
black
is
liable
to
jump
clear
over
you
and
sheep
you
better
get
outside
son
amended
the
dean
who
had
come
out
to
watch
the
beginning
of
the
work
no
no
please
uncle
will
begged
the
lad
they
ca
get
me
as
long
as
i
on
sheep
phil
and
the
dean
laughed
i
look
out
for
him
said
the
young
man
only
he
added
to
the
boy
you
must
keep
out
of
the
way
and
see
that
you
stick
to
sheep
if
you
expect
him
to
take
care
of
you
finished
the
dean
relenting
meanwhile
the
gate
between
the
corrals
had
been
thrown
open
and
with
bob
to
guard
the
opening
curly
rode
in
among
the
unbroken
horses
to
cut
out
the
animal
indicated
by
phil
and
from
within
that
circular
enclosure
where
the
earth
had
been
ground
to
fine
powder
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
frightened
feet
came
the
rolling
thunder
of
hoofs
as
in
a
swirling
cloud
of
yellow
dust
the
horses
rushed
and
leaped
and
whirled
again
and
again
the
frightened
animals
threw
themselves
against
the
barrier
that
hemmed
them
in
but
that
fence
built
of
cedar
posts
set
close
in
stockade
fashion
and
laced
on
the
outside
with
wire
was
made
to
withstand
the
maddened
rush
of
the
heaviest
steers
and
always
amid
the
confusion
of
the
frenzied
animals
the
figure
of
the
mounted
man
in
their
midst
could
be
seen
calmly
directing
their
wildest
movements
and
soon
out
from
the
crowding
jostling
whirling
mass
of
flying
feet
and
tossing
manes
and
tails
the
black
with
the
white
star
shot
toward
the
gate
bob
horse
leaped
aside
from
the
way
horse
was
between
the
black
and
his
mates
and
before
the
animal
could
gather
his
confused
senses
he
was
in
the
larger
corral
the
day
work
had
begun
the
black
dodged
skillfully
and
the
loop
of
curly
riata
missed
the
mark
you
better
let
somebody
put
eyes
in
that
rope
curly
remarked
phil
laconically
as
he
stepped
aside
to
avoid
a
wild
rush
the
chagrined
cowboy
said
something
in
a
low
tone
so
that
little
billy
could
not
hear
the
dean
chuckled
bob
riata
whirled
shot
out
its
snaky
length
and
his
trained
horse
braced
himself
skillfully
to
the
black
weight
on
the
rope
for
a
few
minutes
the
animal
at
the
loop
end
of
the
riata
struggled
desperately
plunging
tugging
throwing
himself
this
way
and
that
but
always
the
experienced
turned
with
his
victim
and
the
rope
was
never
slack
when
his
first
wild
efforts
were
over
and
the
black
stood
with
his
wide
braced
feet
breathing
heavily
as
that
choking
loop
began
to
tell
the
strain
on
the
taut
riata
was
lessened
and
phil
went
quietly
toward
the
frightened
captive
no
one
moved
or
spoke
this
was
not
an
exhibition
the
success
of
which
depended
on
the
vicious
wildness
of
the
horse
to
be
conquered
this
was
work
and
it
was
not
phil
business
to
provoke
the
black
to
extremes
in
order
to
exhibit
his
own
prowess
as
a
rider
for
the
pleasure
of
spectators
who
had
paid
to
see
the
show
the
rider
was
employed
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
unbroken
horse
entrusted
to
him
to
force
obedience
if
necessary
to
gentle
and
train
and
so
make
of
the
wild
creature
a
useful
and
valuable
servant
for
the
dean
there
are
riders
whose
methods
demand
that
they
throw
every
unbroken
horse
given
them
to
handle
and
who
gentle
an
animal
by
beating
it
about
the
head
with
loaded
quirts
ripping
its
flanks
open
with
sharp
spurs
and
tearing
its
mouth
with
torturing
bits
and
ropes
these
turn
over
to
their
employers
as
their
finished
product
horses
that
are
broken
indeed
but
broken
only
in
spirit
with
no
heart
or
courage
left
to
them
with
dispositions
ruined
and
often
with
physical
injuries
from
which
they
never
recover
but
riders
of
such
methods
have
no
place
among
the
men
employed
by
owners
of
the
dean
type
on
the
and
indeed
on
all
ranches
where
conservative
business
principles
are
in
force
the
horses
are
handled
with
all
the
care
and
gentleness
that
the
work
and
the
individuality
of
the
animal
will
permit
after
a
little
phil
hand
gently
touched
the
black
head
instantly
the
struggle
was
resumed
the
rider
dodged
a
vicious
blow
from
the
strong
fore
hoofs
and
with
a
good
natured
laugh
softly
chided
the
desperate
animal
and
so
presently
the
kind
hand
was
again
stretched
forth
and
then
a
broad
band
of
leather
was
deftly
slipped
over
the
black
frightened
eyes
another
thicker
and
softer
rope
was
knotted
so
that
it
could
not
slip
about
the
now
sweating
neck
and
fashioned
into
a
hackamore
or
halter
about
the
animal
nose
then
the
riata
was
loosed
working
deftly
silently
gently
ever
wary
of
those
dangerous
hoofs
phil
next
placed
blanket
and
saddle
on
the
trembling
black
and
drew
the
cinch
tight
then
the
gate
leading
from
the
corral
to
the
open
range
was
swung
back
easily
but
quickly
and
surely
the
rider
swung
to
his
seat
he
paused
a
moment
to
be
sure
that
all
was
right
and
then
leaning
forward
he
reached
over
and
raised
the
leather
blindfold
for
an
instant
the
wild
unbroken
horse
stood
still
then
reared
until
it
seemed
he
must
fall
and
then
as
his
forefeet
touched
the
ground
again
the
spurs
went
home
and
with
a
mighty
leap
forward
the
frenzied
animal
dashed
bucking
plunging
pitching
through
the
gate
and
away
toward
the
open
country
followed
by
curly
and
bob
with
little
billy
spurring
old
sheep
in
hot
pursuit
for
a
little
the
dean
lingered
in
the
suddenly
emptied
corral
stepping
up
on
the
end
of
the
long
watering
trough
close
to
the
dividing
fence
he
studied
with
knowing
eye
the
animals
on
the
other
side
then
leisurely
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
corral
visited
the
windmill
pump
looked
in
on
stella
from
the
kitchen
porch
and
then
saddled
browny
his
own
particular
horse
that
grazed
always
about
the
place
at
privileged
ease
and
rode
off
somewhere
on
some
business
of
his
own
when
the
black
horse
had
spent
his
strength
in
a
vain
attempt
to
rid
himself
of
the
dreadful
burden
that
had
attached
itself
so
securely
to
his
back
he
was
herded
back
to
the
corral
where
the
burden
set
him
free
dripping
with
sweat
trembling
in
every
limb
and
muscle
with
distended
nostrils
and
heaving
flanks
the
black
crowded
in
among
his
mates
again
his
first
lesson
over
his
years
of
ease
and
freedom
past
forever
and
which
will
it
be
this
time
came
curly
question
i
have
that
buckskin
this
trip
answered
phil
and
again
that
swirling
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
those
thundering
hoofs
drifted
over
the
stockade
enclosure
and
out
of
the
mad
confusion
the
buckskin
dashed
wildly
through
the
gate
to
be
initiated
into
his
new
life
and
so
hour
after
hour
the
work
went
on
as
horse
after
horse
at
phil
word
was
cut
out
of
the
band
and
ridden
and
every
horse
according
to
disposition
and
temper
and
strength
was
different
while
his
helpers
did
their
part
the
rider
caught
a
few
moments
rest
always
he
was
good
natured
soft
spoken
and
gentle
when
a
frightened
animal
not
understanding
tried
to
kill
him
he
accepted
it
as
evidence
of
a
commendable
spirit
and
with
that
sunny
boyish
smile
informed
his
pupil
kindly
that
he
was
a
good
horse
and
must
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
so
many
ways
as
the
dean
had
said
at
breakfast
that
morning
horses
are
just
like
men
it
was
when
the
master
of
the
again
strolled
leisurely
out
to
the
corrals
phil
and
his
helpers
including
little
billy
were
just
disappearing
over
the
rise
of
ground
beyond
the
gate
on
the
farther
side
of
the
enclosure
as
the
dean
reached
the
gate
that
opens
toward
the
barn
and
house
he
went
on
through
the
corral
and
slowly
as
one
having
nothing
else
to
do
climbed
the
little
knoll
from
which
he
could
watch
the
riders
in
the
distance
when
the
horsemen
had
disappeared
among
the
scattered
cedars
on
the
ridge
a
mile
or
so
to
the
west
the
dean
still
stood
looking
in
that
direction
but
the
owner
of
the
was
not
watching
for
the
return
of
his
men
he
was
not
even
thinking
of
them
he
was
looking
beyond
the
cedar
ridge
to
where
several
miles
away
a
long
mountain
showed
black
against
the
blue
of
the
more
distant
hills
the
edge
of
this
high
broke
abruptly
in
a
long
series
of
vertical
cliffs
the
formation
known
to
arizonians
as
rim
rocks
the
deep
shadows
of
the
towering
black
wall
of
cliffs
and
the
gloom
of
the
pines
and
cedars
that
hid
the
foot
of
the
mountain
gave
the
place
a
sinister
and
threatening
appearance
as
he
looked
the
dean
kindly
face
grew
somber
and
stern
his
blue
eyes
were
for
the
moment
cold
and
accusing
under
his
grizzled
mustache
his
mouth
usually
so
ready
to
smile
or
laugh
was
set
in
lines
of
uncompromising
firmness
in
these
quiet
and
restful
years
of
the
dean
life
the
tailholt
mountain
outfit
was
the
only
disturbing
element
but
the
dean
did
not
permit
himself
to
be
long
annoyed
by
the
thoughts
provoked
by
tailholt
mountain
philosophically
he
turned
his
broad
back
to
the
intruding
scene
and
went
back
to
the
corral
and
to
the
more
pleasing
occupation
of
looking
at
the
horses
if
the
dean
had
not
so
abruptly
turned
his
back
upon
the
landscape
he
would
have
noticed
the
figure
of
a
man
moving
slowly
along
the
road
that
skirted
the
valley
meadow
leading
from
simmons
to
the
ranch
presently
the
riders
returned
and
phil
when
he
had
removed
saddle
blanket
and
hackamore
from
his
pupil
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
watering
trough
beside
the
dean
i
see
you
ai
tackled
the
big
bay
yet
remarked
the
older
man
thought
if
i
let
him
look
on
for
a
while
he
might
figure
it
out
that
he
better
be
good
and
not
get
himself
hurt
smiled
phil
he
sure
some
horse
he
added
admiringly
then
to
his
helpers
i
take
that
black
with
the
white
forefoot
this
time
curly
just
as
the
fresh
horse
dashed
into
the
larger
corral
a
man
on
foot
appeared
coming
over
the
rise
of
ground
to
the
west
and
by
the
time
that
curly
loop
was
over
the
black
head
the
man
stood
at
the
gate
one
glance
told
phil
that
it
was
the
stranger
whom
he
had
met
on
the
divide
the
man
seemed
to
understand
that
it
was
no
time
for
greetings
and
without
offering
to
enter
the
enclosure
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
big
gate
where
he
sat
with
one
leg
over
the
topmost
bar
an
interested
spectator
the
maneuvers
of
the
black
brought
phil
to
that
side
of
the
corral
and
as
he
coolly
dodged
the
fighting
horse
he
glanced
up
with
his
boyish
smile
and
a
quick
nod
of
welcome
to
the
man
perched
above
him
the
stranger
smiled
in
return
but
did
not
speak
he
must
have
thought
though
that
this
cowboy
appeared
quite
different
from
the
picturesque
rider
he
had
seen
at
the
celebration
and
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
phil
acton
had
been
as
the
cowboy
himself
would
have
said
all
togged
out
in
his
glad
rags
this
man
wore
chaps
that
were
old
and
patched
from
hard
service
his
shirt
unbuttoned
at
the
throat
was
the
color
of
the
corral
dirt
and
a
generous
tear
revealed
one
muscular
shoulder
his
hat
was
greasy
and
battered
his
face
grimed
and
streaked
with
dust
and
sweat
but
his
sunny
boyish
smile
would
have
identified
phil
in
any
garb
when
the
rider
was
ready
to
mount
and
bob
went
to
open
the
gate
the
stranger
climbed
down
and
drew
a
little
aside
and
when
phil
passing
where
he
stood
looked
laughingly
down
at
him
from
the
back
of
the
bucking
plunging
horse
he
made
as
if
to
applaud
but
checked
himself
and
went
quickly
to
the
top
of
the
knoll
to
watch
the
riders
until
they
disappeared
over
the
ridge
howdy
fine
weather
we
havin
it
was
the
dean
hearty
voice
he
had
gone
forward
courteously
to
greet
the
stranger
while
the
latter
was
watching
the
riders
the
man
turned
impulsively
his
face
lighted
with
enthusiasm
by
jove
he
exclaimed
but
that
man
can
ride
yes
phil
does
pretty
well
returned
the
dean
indifferently
won
the
championship
at
prescott
the
other
day
then
more
heartily
he
a
mighty
good
boy
too
take
him
any
way
you
like
as
he
spoke
the
cattleman
looked
the
stranger
over
critically
much
as
he
would
have
looked
at
a
steer
or
horse
noting
the
long
limbs
the
body
the
strong
face
and
clear
dark
eyes
the
man
dress
told
the
dean
simply
that
the
stranger
was
from
the
city
his
bearing
commanded
the
older
man
respect
the
stranger
next
statement
as
he
looked
thoughtfully
over
the
wide
land
of
valley
and
hill
and
mesa
and
mountain
convinced
the
dean
that
he
was
a
man
of
judgment
arizona
is
a
wonderful
country
sir
wonderful
finest
in
the
world
sir
agreed
the
dean
promptly
there
just
naturally
ca
be
any
better
we
got
the
climate
we
got
the
land
and
we
got
the
men
the
stranger
looked
at
the
dean
quickly
when
he
said
men
it
was
worth
much
to
hear
the
dean
speak
that
word
indeed
you
have
he
returned
heartily
i
never
saw
such
men
of
course
you
have
said
the
dean
i
tell
you
sir
they
just
do
make
outside
of
arizona
it
takes
a
country
like
this
to
produce
real
men
a
man
got
to
be
a
man
out
here
of
course
though
he
admitted
kindly
we
do
know
much
except
to
ride
an
throw
a
rope
an
shoot
mebby
once
in
a
while
the
riders
were
returning
and
the
dean
and
the
stranger
walked
back
down
the
little
hill
to
the
corral
you
have
a
fine
ranch
here
baldwin
again
observed
the
stranger
the
dean
glanced
at
him
sharply
many
men
had
tried
to
buy
the
this
man
certainly
appeared
prosperous
even
though
he
was
walking
but
there
was
no
accounting
for
the
queer
things
that
city
men
would
do
it
does
pretty
well
the
cattleman
admitted
i
manage
to
make
a
livin
the
other
smiled
as
though
slightly
embarrassed
then
do
you
need
any
help
help
the
dean
looked
at
him
amazed
i
mean
i
would
like
a
position
to
work
for
you
you
know
the
dean
was
speechless
again
he
surveyed
the
stranger
with
his
measuring
critical
look
you
never
done
any
work
he
said
gently
the
man
stood
very
straight
before
him
and
spoke
almost
defiantly
no
i
have
but
is
that
any
reason
why
i
should
not
the
dean
eyes
twinkled
as
they
have
a
way
of
doing
when
you
say
something
that
he
likes
i
say
it
a
better
reason
why
you
should
he
returned
quietly
then
he
said
to
phil
who
having
dismissed
his
pupil
was
coming
toward
them
phil
this
man
wants
a
job
think
we
can
use
him
the
young
man
looked
at
the
stranger
with
unfeigned
surprise
and
with
a
hint
of
amusement
but
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
ever
seen
him
before
the
same
natural
delicacy
of
feeling
that
had
prevented
the
cowboy
from
discussing
the
man
upon
whose
privacy
he
felt
he
had
intruded
that
evening
of
their
meeting
on
the
divide
led
him
now
to
ignore
the
incident
a
consideration
which
could
not
but
command
the
strange
respect
and
for
which
he
looked
his
gratitude
there
was
something
about
the
stranger
too
that
to
phil
seemed
different
this
tall
fellow
who
stood
before
them
so
and
ready
for
anything
was
not
altogether
like
the
uncertain
embarrassed
and
troubled
gentleman
at
whom
phil
had
first
laughed
with
thinly
veiled
contempt
and
then
had
pitied
it
was
as
though
the
man
who
sat
that
night
alone
on
the
divide
had
out
of
the
very
bitterness
of
his
experience
called
forth
from
within
himself
a
strength
of
which
until
then
he
had
been
only
dimly
conscious
there
was
now
in
his
face
and
bearing
courage
and
decision
and
purpose
and
with
it
all
a
glint
of
that
same
humor
that
had
made
him
so
bitterly
mock
himself
the
dean
philosophy
touching
the
possibilities
of
the
man
who
laughs
when
he
is
hurt
seemed
in
this
stranger
about
to
be
justified
phil
felt
oddly
too
that
the
man
was
in
a
way
experimenting
with
himself
testing
himself
as
it
were
and
being
altogether
a
normal
human
the
cowboy
felt
strongly
inclined
to
help
the
experimenter
in
this
spirit
he
answered
the
dean
while
looking
mischievously
at
the
stranger
we
can
use
him
if
he
can
ride
the
stranger
smiled
understandingly
i
do
see
why
i
could
he
returned
in
that
droll
tone
i
seem
to
have
the
legs
he
looked
down
at
his
long
lower
limbs
reflectively
as
though
quaintly
considering
them
quite
apart
from
himself
phil
laughed
huh
said
the
dean
slightly
mystified
at
the
apparent
understanding
between
the
young
men
then
to
the
stranger
what
do
you
want
to
work
for
you
do
look
as
though
you
needed
to
a
sort
of
vacation
heh
there
was
spirit
in
the
man
answer
i
want
to
work
for
the
reason
that
all
men
want
work
if
you
do
not
employ
me
i
must
try
somewhere
else
come
from
prescott
to
simmons
on
the
stage
did
you
no
sir
i
walked
walked
huh
tried
anywhere
else
for
a
job
no
sir
who
sent
you
out
here
the
stranger
smiled
i
saw
acton
ride
in
the
contest
i
learned
that
he
was
foreman
of
the
ranch
i
thought
i
would
rather
work
where
he
worked
if
i
could
the
dean
looked
at
phil
phil
looked
at
the
dean
together
they
looked
at
the
stranger
the
two
cowboys
who
were
sitting
on
their
horses
grinned
at
each
other
and
what
is
your
name
sir
the
dean
asked
courteously
for
the
first
time
the
man
hesitated
and
seemed
embarrassed
he
looked
uneasily
about
with
a
helpless
inquiring
glance
as
though
appealing
for
some
suggestion
oh
never
mind
your
name
if
you
have
forgotten
it
said
the
dean
dryly
the
stranger
roaming
eyes
fell
upon
phil
old
chaps
that
in
every
wrinkle
and
scar
and
rip
and
tear
gave
such
eloquent
testimony
as
to
the
wearer
life
and
that
curious
smile
touched
his
lips
then
throwing
up
his
head
and
looking
the
dean
straight
in
the
eye
he
said
boldly
but
with
that
note
of
droll
humor
in
his
voice
my
name
is
patches
sir
honorable
patches
the
dean
eyes
twinkled
but
his
face
was
grave
phil
face
flushed
he
had
not
failed
to
identify
the
source
of
the
stranger
inspiration
but
before
either
the
dean
or
phil
could
speak
a
shout
of
laughter
came
from
curly
elson
and
the
stranger
had
turned
to
face
the
cowboy
something
seems
to
amuse
you
he
said
quietly
to
the
man
on
the
horse
and
at
the
tone
of
his
voice
phil
and
the
dean
exchanged
significant
glances
the
grinning
cowboy
looked
down
at
the
stranger
in
evident
contempt
patches
he
drawled
honorable
patches
that
a
hell
of
a
name
now
ai
it
the
man
went
two
long
steps
toward
the
mocking
rider
and
spoke
quietly
but
with
unmistakable
meaning
i
endeavor
to
make
it
all
of
that
for
you
if
you
will
get
off
your
horse
the
grinning
cowboy
with
a
wink
at
his
companion
dismounted
cheerfully
curly
elson
was
held
to
be
the
best
man
with
his
hands
in
yavapai
county
he
could
not
refuse
so
tempting
an
opportunity
to
add
to
his
reputation
five
minutes
later
curly
lifted
himself
on
one
elbow
in
the
corral
dust
and
looked
up
with
respectful
admiration
to
the
quiet
man
who
stood
waiting
for
him
to
rise
curly
lip
was
bleeding
generously
the
side
of
his
face
seemed
to
have
slipped
out
of
place
and
his
left
eye
was
closing
surely
and
rapidly
get
up
said
the
tall
man
calmly
there
is
more
where
that
came
from
if
you
want
it
the
cowboy
grinned
painfully
i
ai
hankerin
after
any
more
he
mumbled
feeling
his
face
tenderly
it
said
that
my
name
was
patches
suggested
the
stranger
sure
patches
i
reckon
nobody
question
that
honorable
patches
again
prompted
the
stranger
yes
sir
you
bet
honorable
patches
agreed
curly
with
emphasis
then
as
he
painfully
regained
his
feet
he
held
out
his
hand
with
as
nearly
a
smile
as
his
battered
features
would
permit
do
you
mind
shaking
on
it
mr
honorable
patches
just
to
show
that
there
no
hard
feelin
patches
responded
instantly
with
a
manner
that
won
curly
heart
good
he
said
i
knew
you
would
do
that
when
you
understood
or
i
would
have
bothered
to
show
you
my
credentials
my
mistake
returned
curly
it
them
there
credentials
of
yourn
not
your
name
that
hell
he
gingerly
mounted
his
horse
again
and
patches
turned
back
to
the
dean
as
though
apologizing
for
the
interruption
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
about
work
the
dean
never
told
anyone
just
what
his
thoughts
were
at
that
particular
moment
probably
because
they
were
so
many
and
so
contradictory
and
confusing
whether
from
this
uncertainty
of
mind
from
a
habit
of
depending
upon
his
young
foreman
or
because
of
that
something
which
phil
and
the
stranger
seemed
to
have
in
common
he
shifted
the
whole
matter
by
saying
it
up
to
phil
here
he
foreman
of
the
if
he
wants
to
hire
you
it
all
right
with
me
at
this
the
two
young
men
faced
each
other
and
on
the
face
of
each
was
a
half
questioning
half
challenging
smile
the
stranger
seemed
to
say
i
know
i
am
at
your
mercy
i
do
expect
you
to
believe
in
me
after
our
meeting
on
the
divide
but
i
dare
you
to
put
me
to
the
test
and
phil
if
he
had
spoken
might
have
said
i
felt
when
i
met
you
first
that
there
was
a
man
around
somewhere
i
know
you
are
curious
to
see
what
you
would
do
if
put
to
the
test
i
am
curious
too
i
give
you
a
chance
aloud
he
reminded
the
stranger
pointedly
i
said
we
might
use
you
if
you
could
ride
patches
smiled
his
smile
evidently
appreciating
his
predicament
and
i
said
he
retorted
that
i
did
see
why
i
could
phil
turned
to
his
grinning
but
respectful
helpers
bring
out
that
bay
with
the
blazed
face
great
snakes
ejaculated
curly
to
bob
as
they
reached
the
gate
leading
to
the
adjoining
corral
his
name
is
patches
all
right
but
he
be
pieces
when
that
bay
devil
gets
through
with
him
if
he
ride
do
you
reckon
he
can
dunno
returned
bob
as
he
unlatched
the
gate
without
dismounting
i
thought
he
could
fight
so
did
i
returned
curly
grimly
nursing
his
battered
face
you
cut
out
the
horse
i
ca
half
see
it
was
no
trouble
to
cut
out
the
bay
the
big
horse
seemed
to
understand
that
his
time
had
come
all
day
he
had
seen
his
mates
go
forth
to
their
testing
had
watched
them
as
they
fought
with
all
their
strength
the
skill
and
endurance
of
that
smiling
man
and
then
had
seen
them
as
they
returned
sweating
trembling
conquered
and
subdued
as
bob
rode
toward
him
he
stood
for
one
defiant
moment
as
motionless
as
a
horse
of
bronze
then
with
a
suddenness
that
gave
curly
at
the
gate
barely
time
to
dodge
his
rush
he
leaped
forward
into
the
larger
arena
phil
was
watching
the
stranger
as
the
big
horse
came
through
the
gate
the
man
did
not
move
but
his
eyes
were
glowing
darkly
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
was
smiling
to
himself
mockingly
as
though
amused
at
the
thought
of
what
was
about
to
happen
to
him
the
dean
also
was
watching
patches
and
again
the
young
foreman
and
his
employer
exchanged
significant
glances
as
phil
turned
and
went
quickly
to
little
billy
lifting
the
lad
from
his
saddle
and
seating
him
on
the
fence
above
the
long
watering
trough
he
said
there
a
grandstand
seat
for
you
pardner
do
get
down
unless
you
have
to
and
then
get
down
outside
see
at
that
moment
yells
of
warning
with
a
look
out
phil
came
from
curly
bob
and
the
dean
a
quick
look
over
his
shoulder
and
phil
saw
the
big
horse
with
ears
wickedly
flat
eyes
gleaming
and
teeth
bared
making
straight
in
his
direction
the
animal
had
apparently
singled
him
out
as
the
author
of
his
misfortunes
and
proposed
to
dispose
of
his
at
the
very
outset
of
the
battle
there
was
only
one
sane
thing
to
do
and
phil
did
it
a
vigorous
scrambling
leap
placed
him
beside
little
billy
on
the
top
of
the
fence
above
the
watering
trough
good
thing
i
reserved
a
seat
in
your
grandstand
for
myself
was
it
pardner
he
smiled
down
at
the
boy
by
his
side
then
bob
riata
fell
true
and
as
the
powerful
horse
plunged
and
fought
that
strangling
noose
phil
came
leisurely
down
from
the
fence
where
was
you
goin
phil
chuckled
the
dean
you
sure
war
losin
any
time
laughed
curly
and
bob
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
vicious
animal
at
the
end
of
his
taut
riata
and
working
skillfully
with
his
trained
to
foil
every
wicked
plunge
and
wild
leap
grinned
with
appreciation
as
he
added
i
bet
four
bits
you
ca
do
it
again
phil
without
a
runnin
start
i
just
thought
i
keep
little
billy
company
for
a
spell
smiled
phil
he
looked
so
sort
of
lonesome
up
there
the
stranger
at
first
amazed
that
they
could
turn
into
jest
an
incident
which
might
so
easily
have
been
a
tragedy
suddenly
laughed
aloud
a
joyous
ringing
laugh
that
made
phil
look
at
him
sharply
i
beg
your
pardon
acton
said
patches
meekly
but
with
that
droll
voice
which
brought
a
glint
of
laughter
into
the
foreman
eyes
and
called
forth
another
chuckle
from
the
dean
you
can
take
my
saddle
said
phil
pointedly
it
over
there
at
the
end
of
the
watering
trough
you
find
the
stirrups
about
right
i
reckon
i
ride
with
them
rather
long
for
a
moment
the
stranger
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
then
without
a
word
started
for
the
saddle
he
was
half
way
to
the
end
of
the
watering
trough
when
phil
overtook
him
i
believe
i
rather
saddle
him
myself
the
cowboy
explained
quietly
with
his
sunny
smile
you
see
i
got
to
teach
these
horses
some
cow
sense
before
the
fall
rodeo
and
i
rather
particular
about
the
way
they
handled
at
the
start
exactly
returned
patches
i
do
blame
you
that
fellow
seems
rather
to
demand
careful
treatment
does
he
phil
laughed
oh
you
do
need
to
be
too
particular
about
his
feelings
once
you
up
in
the
middle
of
him
he
retorted
the
big
bay
instead
of
acquiring
sense
from
his
observations
as
phil
had
expressed
to
the
dean
a
hope
that
he
would
seemed
to
have
gained
courage
and
determination
phil
approach
was
the
signal
for
a
mad
plunge
in
the
young
man
direction
which
was
checked
by
the
skill
and
weight
of
bob
trained
on
the
rope
several
times
phil
went
toward
the
bay
and
every
time
his
advance
was
met
by
one
of
those
vicious
rushes
then
phil
mounted
curly
horse
and
from
his
hand
the
loop
of
another
riata
fell
over
the
bay
head
shortening
his
rope
by
coiling
it
in
his
rein
hand
he
maneuvered
the
trained
horse
closer
and
closer
to
his
struggling
captive
until
with
bob
on
the
other
side
of
the
fighting
animal
he
could
with
safety
fix
the
leather
blindfold
over
those
wicked
eyes
when
at
last
hackamore
and
saddle
were
in
place
and
the
bay
stood
trembling
and
sweating
phil
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
own
forehead
and
turned
to
the
stranger
your
horse
is
ready
sir
the
man
face
was
perhaps
a
shade
whiter
than
its
usual
color
but
his
eyes
were
glowing
and
there
was
a
grim
set
look
about
his
smiling
lips
that
made
the
hearts
of
those
men
go
out
to
him
he
seemed
to
realize
so
that
the
joke
was
on
himself
and
with
it
all
exhibited
such
reckless
indifference
to
consequences
without
an
instant
hesitation
he
started
toward
the
horse
great
snakes
muttered
curly
to
bob
talk
about
nerve
the
dean
started
forward
wait
a
minute
patches
he
said
the
stranger
faced
him
can
you
ride
that
horse
asked
the
dean
pointedly
i
going
to
returned
patches
but
he
added
with
his
droll
humor
i
ca
say
how
far
do
you
know
that
he
kill
you
if
he
can
questioned
the
dean
curiously
while
his
eyes
twinkled
approval
he
does
seem
to
have
some
such
notion
admitted
patches
you
better
let
him
alone
said
the
dean
you
do
need
to
kill
yourself
to
get
a
job
with
this
outfit
that
very
kind
of
you
sir
returned
the
stranger
gratefully
rather
glad
you
said
that
but
i
going
to
ride
him
just
the
same
they
looked
at
him
in
amazement
for
it
was
clear
to
them
now
that
the
man
really
could
not
ride
the
dean
spoke
kindly
why
because
said
patches
slowly
i
am
curious
to
see
what
i
will
do
under
such
circumstances
and
if
i
do
try
the
experiment
now
never
know
whether
i
have
the
nerve
to
do
it
or
not
as
he
finished
he
turned
and
walked
deliberately
toward
the
horse
phil
ran
to
curly
side
and
the
cowboy
at
his
foreman
gesture
leaped
from
his
saddle
the
young
man
mounted
his
helper
horse
and
with
a
quick
movement
caught
the
riata
from
the
saddle
horn
and
flipped
open
a
ready
loop
the
stranger
was
close
to
the
bay
off
or
right
side
the
other
side
patches
called
phil
genially
you
want
to
start
in
right
you
know
not
a
man
laughed
except
the
stranger
thanks
he
said
and
came
around
to
the
proper
side
take
your
time
called
phil
again
stand
by
his
shoulder
and
watch
his
heels
take
the
stirrup
with
your
right
hand
and
turn
it
to
catch
your
foot
stay
back
by
his
shoulder
until
you
are
ready
to
swing
up
take
your
time
i
wo
be
long
returned
patches
as
he
awkwardly
gained
his
seat
in
the
saddle
phil
moved
his
horse
nearer
the
center
of
the
corral
and
shook
out
his
loop
a
little
when
you
ready
lean
over
and
pull
up
the
blindfold
he
called
the
man
on
the
horse
did
not
hesitate
with
every
angry
nerve
and
muscle
strained
to
the
utmost
the
powerful
bay
leaped
into
the
air
coming
down
with
legs
stiff
and
head
between
his
knees
for
an
instant
the
man
miraculously
kept
his
place
with
another
vicious
plunge
and
a
twist
the
maddened
brute
went
up
again
and
this
time
the
man
was
flung
from
the
saddle
as
from
a
gigantic
catapult
to
fall
upon
his
shoulders
and
back
in
the
corral
dust
where
he
lay
still
the
horse
rid
of
his
enemy
leaped
again
then
with
catlike
quickness
and
devilish
cunning
whirled
and
with
wicked
teeth
bared
and
vicious
blazing
eyes
rushed
for
the
helpless
man
on
the
ground
with
a
yell
bob
spurred
to
put
himself
between
the
bay
and
his
victim
but
had
there
been
time
the
move
would
have
been
useless
for
no
horse
could
have
withstood
that
mad
charge
the
vicious
brute
was
within
a
bound
of
his
victim
and
had
reared
to
crush
him
with
the
weight
of
heavy
hoofs
when
a
rawhide
rope
tightened
about
those
uplifted
forefeet
and
the
bay
himself
crashed
to
earth
leaving
the
to
hold
the
riata
tight
phil
sprang
from
his
saddle
and
ran
to
the
fallen
man
the
dean
came
with
water
in
his
felt
hat
from
the
trough
and
presently
the
stranger
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
lay
looking
up
into
their
faces
as
though
wondering
where
he
was
and
how
he
happened
there
are
you
hurt
bad
asked
the
dean
that
brought
him
to
his
senses
and
he
got
to
his
feet
somewhat
unsteadily
and
began
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes
then
he
looked
curiously
toward
the
horse
that
curly
was
holding
down
by
the
simple
means
of
sitting
on
the
animal
head
i
certainly
thought
my
legs
were
long
enough
to
reach
around
him
he
said
reflectively
how
in
the
world
did
he
manage
it
i
seemed
to
be
falling
for
a
week
phil
yelled
and
the
dean
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
red
cheeks
while
bob
and
curly
went
wild
patches
went
to
the
horse
and
gravely
walked
around
him
then
let
him
up
he
said
to
curly
the
cowboy
looked
at
phil
who
nodded
as
the
bay
regained
his
feet
patches
started
toward
him
here
said
the
dean
peremptorily
you
come
away
from
there
i
going
to
see
if
he
can
do
it
again
declared
patches
grimly
not
you
ai
returned
the
dean
you
workin
for
me
now
an
you
too
good
a
man
to
be
killed
tryin
any
more
crazy
experiments
at
the
dean
words
the
look
of
gratitude
in
the
man
eyes
was
almost
pathetic
i
wonder
if
i
am
he
said
so
low
that
only
the
dean
and
phil
heard
if
you
are
what
asked
the
dean
puzzled
by
his
manner
worth
anything
as
a
man
you
know
came
the
strange
reply
the
dean
chuckled
you
be
all
right
when
you
get
your
growth
come
on
over
here
now
out
of
the
way
while
phil
takes
some
of
the
cussedness
out
of
that
fool
horse
together
they
watched
phil
ride
the
bay
and
return
him
to
his
mates
a
very
tired
and
a
much
wiser
pupil
then
while
patches
remained
to
watch
further
operations
in
the
corral
the
dean
went
to
the
house
to
tell
stella
all
about
it
and
what
do
you
think
he
really
is
she
asked
as
the
last
of
a
long
list
of
questions
and
comments
the
dean
shook
his
head
there
no
tellin
a
man
like
that
is
liable
to
be
anything
then
he
added
with
his
usual
philosophy
he
acts
though
like
a
genuine
thoroughbred
that
been
badly
mishandled
an
has
just
found
it
out
when
the
day
work
was
finished
and
supper
was
over
little
billy
found
patches
where
he
stood
looking
across
the
valley
toward
granite
mountain
that
loomed
so
boldly
against
the
soft
light
of
the
evening
sky
the
man
greeted
the
boy
awkwardly
as
though
unaccustomed
to
children
but
little
billy
very
much
at
ease
signified
his
readiness
to
help
the
stranger
to
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
world
of
which
he
knew
so
much
more
than
this
big
man
he
began
with
no
waste
of
time
on
mere
preliminaries
see
that
mountain
over
there
that
granite
mountain
there
wild
horses
live
around
there
an
sometimes
we
catch
bet
you
do
know
that
phil
name
is
horse
phil
patches
smiled
that
a
good
name
for
him
is
it
you
bet
he
turned
and
pointed
eagerly
to
the
west
there
another
mountain
over
there
i
bet
you
do
know
the
name
of
which
one
do
you
mean
i
see
several
that
long
black
lookin
one
do
you

about
it

really
afraid

said
billy
proud
of
his
superior
knowledge
that
there
tailholt
mountain
indeed
yes
and
nick
cambert
and
yavapai
joe
lives
over
there
do
you
know
about
them
the
tall
man
shook
his
head
no
i
do
believe
that
i
do
little
billy
lowered
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
well
i
tell
you
only

out
loud
nick
and
yavapai
is
cattle
thieves

then
they
wish

phil
he

pardner

bet
returned
the
stranger
as
if
not
wishing
to
acquire
further
information
about
the
men
of
tailholt
mountain
you
bet
he
is
came
the
instant
response
only

well
that
too
bad
is
it
yes
you

jim
reid

kitty
daddy
they
live
over
there
he
pointed
across
the
meadow
to
where
a
mile
away
a
light
twinkled
in
the
window
of
the
ranch
house
kitty
reid
a
mighty
nice
girl
i
tell
you
but
jim
he
says
that
there
need
no
come
around
tryin
to
get
her
she
been
away
to
school
you
know
an
i
think
phil
whoa
hold
on
a
minute
sonny
interrupted
patches
hastily
what
the
matter
questioned
little
billy
why
it
strikes
me
that
a
boy
with
a
pardner
like
horse
ought
to
be
mighty
careful
about
how
he
talked
over
that
private
affairs
with
a
stranger
do
you
think
so
mebby
so
agreed
billy
but
you
see
i
know
that
phil
wants
kitty
sh
what
in
the
world
is
that
whispered
patches
in
great
fear
catching
his
small
companion
by
the
arm
that
do
you
know
an
owl
when
you
hear
one
gee
but
you
a
tenderfoot
ai
you
catching
sight
of
the
dean
who
was
coming
toward
them
he
shouted
gleefully
uncle
will
patches
is
scared
of
an
owl
what
do
you
know
about
that
patches
is
scared
of
an
owl
your
aunt
stella
wants
you
laughed
the
dean
and
billy
ran
off
to
the
house
to
share
his
joke
on
the
tenderfoot
with
his
aunt
stella
and
his
pardner
phil
i
got
to
go
to
town
said
the
dean
i
expect
you
better
go
along
and
get
your
trunk
or
whatever
you
have
and
some
sort
of
an
outfit
you
ca
work
in
them
clothes
patches
answered
hesitatingly
why
i
think
i
can
get
along
all
right
mr
baldwin
but
you
want
your
stuff
your
trunk
or
grip
or
whatever
got
returned
the
dean
but
i
have
nothing
in
prescott
said
the
stranger
slowly
you
have
well
you
need
an
outfit
anyway
persisted
the
cattleman
really
i
think
i
can
get
along
for
a
while
patches
returned
diffidently
the
dean
considered
for
a
little
then
he
said
with
straightforward
bluntness
but
not
at
all
unkindly
look
here
young
man
you
afraid
to
go
to
prescott
are
you
the
other
laughed
not
at
all
sir
it
not
that
i
suppose
i
must
tell
you
now
though
all
the
clothes
i
have
are
on
my
back
and
i
have
a
cent
in
the
world
with
which
to
buy
an
outfit
as
you
call
it
the
dean
chuckled
so
that
it
i
thought
mebby
you
was
dodgin
the
sheriff
if
it
just
plain
broke
that
the
matter
why
you
go
to
town
with
me
in
the
mornin
an
we
get
what
you
need
i
hold
it
out
of
your
wages
until
it
paid
as
though
the
matter
were
settled
he
turned
back
toward
the
house
adding
phil
will
show
you
where
you
to
sleep
when
the
foreman
had
shown
the
new
man
to
his
room
the
cowboy
asked
casually
found
the
goat
ranch
all
right
night
before
last
did
you
the
other
hesitated
then
he
said
gravely
i
did
look
for
it
mr
acton
you
did
look
for
it
no
sir
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
spent
the
night
up
there
on
the
divide
without
blankets
or
anything
yes
sir
i
did
and
where
did
you
stop
last
night
at
simmons
walked
i
suppose
the
stranger
smiled
yes
but
look
here
said
the
puzzled
cowboy
i
do
mean
to
be
asking
questions
about
what
is
none
of
my
business
but
i
ca
figure
it
out
if
you
were
coming
out
here
to
get
a
job
on
the
why
did
you
go
to
baldwin
in
town
anybody
could
have
pointed
him
out
to
you
or
why
did
you
say
something
to
me
when
we
were
talking
back
there
on
the
divide
why
you
see
explained
the
other
lamely
i
did
exactly
want
to
work
on
the
or
anywhere
but
you
told
uncle
will
that
you
wanted
to
work
here
and
you
were
on
your
way
when
i
met
you
yes
i
know
but
you
see
oh
hang
it
all
acton
have
you
ever
wanted
to
do
something
that
you
did
want
to
do
have
you
ever
been
caught
in
a
corner
that
you
were
simply
forced
to
get
out
of
when
you
did
like
the
only
way
that
would
get
you
out
i
do
mean
anything
criminal
he
added
with
a
short
laugh
yes
i
have
returned
the
other
seriously
and
if
you
do
mind
there
no
handle
to
my
name
around
here
i
just
plain
phil
mr
patches
thanks
neither
does
patches
need
decorating
and
now
one
more
said
phil
with
his
winning
smile
why
in
the
name
of
all
the
obstinate
fools
that
roam
at
large
did
you
walk
out
here
when
you
must
have
had
plenty
of
chances
to
ride
well
you
see
said
patches
slowly
i
fear
i
ca
explain
but
it
was
just
a
part
of
my
job
your
job
but
you
did
have
any
job
until
this
afternoon
oh
yes
i
did
i
had
the
biggest
kind
of
a
job
you
see
that
what
i
was
doing
on
the
divide
all
night
trying
to
find
some
other
way
to
do
it
and
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
that
job
is
asked
phil
curiously
patches
laughed
as
though
at
himself
i
do
know
that
i
can
exactly
he
said
i
think
perhaps
it
just
to
ride
that
big
bay
horse
out
there
phil
laughed
aloud
a
hearty
laugh
of
you
do
that
all
right
do
you
think
so
really
asked
patches
eagerly
sure
i
know
it
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
returned
the
strange
man
doubtfully
and
the
cowboy
wondering
saw
that
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
that
big
devil
is
a
man
horse
all
right
mused
phil
why
of
course
and
that
just
it
do
you
see
cried
the
other
impulsively
then
as
if
he
regretted
his
words
he
asked
quickly
do
you
name
your
horses
sure
answered
the
cowboy
we
generally
find
something
to
call
them
and
have
you
named
the
big
bay
yet
phil
laughed
i
named
him
yesterday
when
he
broke
away
as
we
were
bringing
the
bunch
in
and
i
had
to
rope
him
to
get
him
back
and
what
did
you
name
him
stranger
stranger
and
why
stranger
oh
i
do
know
just
one
of
my
fool
notions
returned
phil
chapter
a
bit
of
the
past
the
next
morning
baldwin
and
patches
set
out
for
town
i
suppose
said
the
dean
and
a
slightly
curious
tone
colored
the
remark
that
mebby
you
been
used
to
automobiles
buck
and
prince
here
an
this
old
buckboard
will
seem
sort
of
slow
to
you
patches
was
stepping
into
the
rig
as
the
dean
spoke
as
the
young
man
took
his
seat
by
the
cattleman
side
the
dean
nodded
to
phil
who
was
holding
the
team
at
the
signal
phil
released
the
horses
heads
and
stepped
aside
whereupon
buck
and
prince
of
one
mind
looked
back
over
their
shoulders
made
a
few
playful
attempts
to
twist
themselves
out
of
the
harness
lunged
forward
their
length
stood
straight
up
on
their
hind
feet
then
sprang
away
as
if
they
were
fully
determined
to
land
that
buckboard
in
prescott
within
the
next
fifteen
minutes
did
you
say
slow
questioned
patches
as
he
clung
to
his
seat
the
dean
chuckled
and
favored
his
new
man
with
a
twinkling
glance
of
approval
a
few
seconds
later
on
the
other
side
of
the
sandy
wash
the
dean
skillfully
checked
their
headlong
career
with
a
narrow
margin
of
safety
between
the
team
and
the
gate
i
reckon
we
get
through
with
less
fuss
if
you
open
it
he
said
to
patches
then
to
buck
and
prince
whoa
you
blamed
fools
ca
you
stand
a
minute
stella
been
devilin
me
to
get
a
machine
ever
since
jim
reid
got
his
he
continued
while
the
horses
were
repeating
their
preliminary
contortions
and
patches
was
regaining
his
seat
but
i
told
her
i
be
scared
to
death
to
ride
in
the
fool
contraption
at
this
buck
and
prince
in
a
wild
riot
of
animal
strength
and
spirit
leaped
a
slight
depression
in
the
road
with
such
vigor
that
the
front
wheels
of
the
buckboard
left
the
ground
patches
glanced
sidewise
at
his
employer
with
a
smile
of
delighted
appreciation
but
said
nothing
the
dean
liked
him
for
that
the
dean
always
insists
that
the
hardest
man
in
the
world
to
talk
to
is
the
one
who
always
has
something
to
say
for
himself
why
he
continued
with
a
burst
of
honest
feeling
if
i
was
ever
to
bring
one
of
them
things
home
to
the
i
be
ashamed
to
look
a
horse
or
steer
in
the
face
they
dashed
through
a
patch
of
wild
sunflowers
that
in
the
bottom
lands
grow
thick
and
rank
whirled
past
the
corner
of
an
old
fence
that
enclosed
a
long
neglected
garden
and
dashed
recklessly
through
a
deserted
and
yard
on
one
side
of
the
road
was
the
ancient
barn
and
stable
with
sagging
roof
leaning
walls
and
battered
doors
that
hung
dejectedly
on
their
rusty
and
broken
hinges
the
corral
stockade
was
breached
in
many
places
by
the
years
that
had
rotted
the
posts
the
windlass
pump
that
operated
by
a
blind
burro
once
lifted
water
for
the
long
vanished
herds
was
a
pathetic
old
wreck
incapable
now
of
offering
drink
to
a
thirsty
sparrow
on
their
other
hand
beneath
the
wide
branches
of
giant
sycamores
and
walnuts
and
backed
by
a
tangled
orchard
wilderness
stood
an
old
house
empty
and
neglected
as
if
in
the
shadowy
gloom
of
the
untrimmed
trees
it
awaited
lonely
and
forlorn
the
kindly
hand
of
oblivion
this
is
the
old
acton
homestead
said
the
dean
quietly
as
one
might
speak
beside
an
ancient
grave
then
as
they
were
driving
through
the
narrow
lane
that
crosses
the
great
meadow
he
indicated
with
a
nod
of
his
head
group
of
buildings
on
the
other
side
of
the
green
fields
and
something
less
than
a
mile
to
the
south
that
jim
reid
place
his
iron
is
the
jim
stock
runs
on
the
old
acton
range
but
the
homestead
belongs
to
phil
yet
jim
reid
a
fine
man
the
dean
spoke
stoutly
almost
as
though
he
were
making
the
assertion
to
convince
himself
yes
sir
jim
all
right
good
neighbor
good
cowman
square
as
they
make
some
folks
seem
to
think
he
a
mite
an
sometimes
and
he
kind
of
quick
at
suspicionin
everybody
but
jim
and
me
have
always
got
along
the
best
kind
again
the
dean
was
silent
as
though
he
had
forgotten
the
man
beside
him
in
his
occupation
with
thoughts
that
he
could
not
share
when
they
had
crossed
the
valley
meadows
and
climbing
the
hill
on
the
other
side
could
see
the
road
for
several
miles
ahead
the
dean
pointed
to
a
black
object
on
the
next
ridge
there
jim
automobile
now
they
headin
for
prescott
too
kitty
drivin
i
reckon
i
tell
stella
that
that
machine
and
learnin
to
run
the
thing
is
about
all
the
returns
that
jim
can
show
for
the
money
he
spent
in
educatin
her
i
do
mean
he
added
with
a
quick
look
at
patches
as
though
he
feared
to
be
misunderstood
that
kitty
one
of
them
butterfly
girls
she
ai
that
by
a
good
deal
why
she
was
raised
right
here
in
this
neighborhood
an
we
love
her
the
same
as
if
she
was
our
own
she
can
cook
a
meal
or
make
a
dress
as
well
as
her
mother
an
does
it
too
an
she
can
ride
a
horse
or
throw
a
rope
some
punchers
i
seen
but
the
dean
stopped
seemingly
for
want
of
words
to
express
exactly
his
thought
it
seems
to
me
offered
patches
abstractedly
that
education
as
we
call
it
is
a
benefit
only
when
it
adds
to
one
life
if
schooling
or
culture
or
whatever
you
choose
to
term
it
is
permitted
to
rob
one
of
the
fundamental
and
essential
elements
of
life
it
is
most
certainly
an
evil
that
the
idea
exclaimed
the
dean
with
frank
admiration
for
his
companion
ability
to
say
that
which
he
himself
thought
you
say
it
like
a
book
but
that
it
it
ai
the
learnin
an
all
the
stuff
that
kitty
got
while
she
was
at
school
that
worryin
us
it
what
she
likely
to
lose
through
gettin
this
here
modern
higher
livin
loftier
sphere
intellectual
supremacy
idea
is
all
right
if
folks
just
keep
their
feet
on
the
ground
you
take
stella
an
me
now
i
know
we
old
fashioned
an
slow
an
all
that
an
we
seen
a
lot
of
hardships
since
we
was
married
over
in
skull
valley
where
she
was
born
an
raised
she
was
just
a
girl
then
an
i
was
only
a
kid
punchin
steers
for
a
livin
i
suppose
we
seen
about
as
hard
times
as
anybody
at
least
that
what
they
would
be
called
now
but
hell
did
think
nothin
of
it
then
we
was
happy
sir
and
we
been
happy
for
over
forty
year
i
tell
you
sir
we
lived
just
lived
every
minute
and
that
a
blamed
sight
more
than
a
lot
of
these
couples
that
marry
and
separate
and
separate
and
marry
again
can
say
no
sir
what
a
man
gets
that
makes
him
rich
it
what
he
keeps
and
these
folks
that
are
swoppin
the
sort
of
love
that
builds
homes
and
raises
families
and
lets
man
and
wife
work
together
an
meet
trouble
together
an
be
happy
together
an
grow
old
bein
happy
together
if
they
swoppin
all
that
for
these
here
new
ideas
of
such
things
they
makin
a
damned
poor
bargain
accordin
to
my
way
of
thinkin
there
is
such
a
thing
sir
as
educatin
a
man
or
woman
plumb
out
of
reach
of
happiness
look
at
our
phil
the
dean
continued
for
the
man
beside
him
was
a
wonderful
listener
there
just
naturally
could
be
a
better
all
round
man
than
phil
acton
he
healthy
do
know
what
it
is
to
have
an
hour
sickness
strong
as
a
young
bull
clean
honest
square
no
bad
habits
a
fine
worker
an
a
fine
thinker
too
even
if
he
ai
had
much
schoolin
he
read
a
lot
take
him
any
way
you
like
just
as
a
man
i
mean
an
that
the
way
you
got
to
take
there
ai
a
better
man
that
phil
livin
yet
a
lot
of
these
folks
would
say
nothin
but
a
as
for
that
jim
reid
ai
much
more
than
a
himself
i
tell
you
i
seen
that
was
mighty
good
men
an
i
seen
graduates
from
them
there
universities
that
was
plumb
good
for
nothin
with
no
more
real
man
about
than
there
is
about
one
of
these
here
wax
dummies
that
they
hang
clothes
on
in
the
store
windows
what
any
woman
can
see
in
one
of
them
that
would
make
her
want
to
marry
him
is
more
than
i
ever
been
able
to
figger
out
if
the
dean
had
not
been
so
engrossed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
would
have
wondered
at
the
strange
effect
of
his
words
upon
his
companion
the
young
man
face
flushed
scarlet
then
paled
as
though
with
sudden
illness
and
he
looked
sidewise
at
the
older
man
with
an
expression
of
shame
and
humiliation
while
his
eyes
wistful
and
pleading
were
filled
with
pain
honorable
patches
who
had
won
the
admiration
of
those
men
in
the
corrals
was
again
the
troubled
shamefaced
creature
whom
phil
met
on
the
divide
but
the
good
dean
did
not
see
and
so
encouraged
by
the
silence
he
continued
his
dissertation
of
course
i
do
mean
to
say
that
education
and
that
sort
of
thing
spoils
every
man
now
young
stanford
manning
if
the
dean
had
suddenly
fired
a
gun
at
patches
the
young
man
could
not
have
shown
greater
surprise
and
consternation
stanford
manning
he
gasped
at
his
tone
the
dean
turned
to
look
at
him
curiously
i
mean
stanford
manning
the
mining
engineer
he
explained
do
you
know
him
i
have
heard
of
him
patches
managed
to
reply
well
continued
the
dean
he
came
out
to
this
country
about
three
years
ago
straight
from
college
and
he
has
sure
made
good
he
got
the
education
an
culture
an
polish
an
all
that
an
with
it
he
can
hold
his
own
among
any
kind
or
sort
of
men
livin
there
ai
a
man
miner
or
anything
else
in
yavapai
county
that
take
off
his
hat
to
stanford
manning
is
he
in
this
country
now
asked
patches
with
an
effort
at
that
the
dean
did
not
notice
no
i
understand
his
company
called
him
back
east
about
a
month
ago
goin
to
send
him
to
some
of
their
properties
up
in
montana
i
heard
when
his
companion
made
no
comment
the
dean
said
reflectively
as
buck
and
prince
climbed
slowly
up
the
grade
to
the
summit
of
the
divide
i
tell
you
son
i
seen
a
good
many
changes
in
this
country
i
can
remember
when
there
was
a
fence
in
all
yavapai
county
hardly
in
the
territory
and
now
why
the
last
time
i
drove
over
to
skull
valley
i
got
so
tangled
up
in
that
i
plumb
lost
myself
when
phil
daddy
me
was
youngsters
we
used
to
ride
from
camp
verde
and
flagstaff
clean
to
date
creek
without
ever
openin
a
gate
but
i
ca
see
that
men
change
much
though
they
good
and
bad
just
like
they
always
been
an
i
reckon
always
will
be
there
been
leaders
and
weaklin
and
just
betwixt
and
betweens
in
every
herd
of
cattle
or
band
of
horses
that
ever
i
owned
you
take
phil
now
he
exactly
like
his
daddy
was
before
him
his
father
must
have
been
a
fine
man
said
patches
with
quiet
earnestness
the
dean
looked
at
him
with
an
approving
twinkle
fine
for
a
few
minutes
as
they
were
rounding
the
turn
of
the
road
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
where
phil
and
the
stranger
had
met
the
dean
looked
away
toward
granite
mountain
then
as
if
thinking
aloud
rather
than
purposely
addressing
his
companion
he
said
john
acton
honest
john
as
everybody
called
him
and
i
came
to
this
country
together
when
we
were
boys
walked
in
sir
with
some
pioneers
from
kansas
we
kept
in
touch
with
each
other
all
the
while
we
was
growin
to
be
men
punched
cattle
for
the
same
outfits
most
of
the
time
even
did
most
of
our
together
for
phil
mother
an
stella
were
neighbors
an
great
friends
over
in
skull
valley
when
we
finally
saved
enough
to
get
started
we
located
homesteads
close
together
back
there
in
the
valley
an
as
soon
as
we
could
get
some
sort
of
shacks
built
we
married
the
girls
and
set
up
housekeepin
our
stock
ranged
together
of
course
but
john
sort
of
took
care
of
the
east
side
of
the
meadows
an
i
kept
more
to
the
west
when
the
children
came
along
john
an
mary
had
three
before
phil
but
only
phil
lived
an
the
stock
had
increased
an
we
built
some
decent
houses
things
seemed
to
be
about
as
fine
as
possible
then
john
went
on
a
note
for
a
man
in
prescott
i
tried
my
best
to
keep
him
out
of
it
but
shucks
he
just
laughed
at
me
you
see
he
was
one
of
the
best
hearted
men
that
ever
lived
one
of
those
men
you
know
that
just
naturally
believes
in
everybody
well
it
wound
up
after
by
john
losin
mighty
nigh
everything
we
managed
to
save
the
homestead
but
practically
all
the
stock
had
to
go
an
it
was
more
than
a
year
after
that
till
mary
died
we
never
did
know
just
what
was
the
matter
with
her
an
after
that
it
seemed
like
john
never
was
the
same
he
got
killed
in
the
rodeo
that
same
fall
just
was
himself
somehow
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
stella
and
me
raised
phil
we
do
know
any
difference
between
him
and
one
of
our
own
boys
the
old
homestead
is
his
of
course
but
jim
stock
runs
on
the
old
range
phil
got
a
few
head
that
he
works
with
mine
a
pretty
good
bunch
by
now
for
he
kept
addin
to
what
his
father
left
an
i
paid
him
wages
ever
since
he
was
big
enough
phil
do
say
much
even
to
stella
an
me
but
i
know
he
figurin
on
fixin
up
the
old
home
place
some
day
after
a
long
silence
the
dean
said
again
as
if
voicing
some
conclusion
of
his
unspoken
thoughts
jim
reid
is
pretty
well
fixed
you
see
kitty
bein
the
only
girl
it
natural
i
reckon
that
they
should
have
ideas
about
her
future
an
all
that
i
reckon
it
natural
too
that
the
girl
should
find
ranch
life
away
out
here
so
far
from
anywhere
a
little
slow
after
her
three
years
at
school
in
the
east
she
never
says
it
but
somehow
you
can
most
always
tell
what
kitty
thinkin
without
her
speakin
a
word
i
have
known
people
like
that
said
patches
probably
because
there
was
so
little
that
he
could
say
yes
an
when
you
know
kitty
you
say
like
i
always
have
that
if
there
a
man
in
yavapai
county
that
would
ride
the
hoofs
off
the
best
horse
in
his
outfit
night
or
day
to
win
a
smile
from
her
he
ought
to
be
lynched
that
afternoon
in
prescott
they
purchased
an
outfit
for
patches
and
the
following
day
set
out
for
the
long
return
drive
to
the
ranch
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
at
the
western
end
of
the
meadow
lane
when
they
saw
a
young
woman
on
a
black
horse
riding
away
from
the
gate
that
opens
from
the
lane
into
the
meadow
pasture
toward
the
ranch
buildings
on
the
farther
side
of
the
field
as
they
drove
into
the
yard
at
home
it
was
nearly
supper
time
and
the
men
were
coming
from
the
corrals
kitty
been
over
all
the
afternoon
little
billy
informed
them
promptly
i
told
her
all
about
you
patches
she
says
she
just
to
see
you
phil
joined
in
the
laugh
but
patches
fancied
that
there
was
a
shadow
in
the
cowboy
usually
sunny
eyes
as
the
young
man
looked
at
him
to
say
that
big
horse
of
yours
sure
made
me
ride
some
chapter
vi
the
drift
fence
the
education
of
honorable
patches
was
begun
without
further
delay
because
phil
time
was
so
fully
occupied
with
his
pupils
the
dean
himself
became
the
stranger
teacher
and
all
sorts
of
odd
jobs
about
the
ranch
from
cleaning
the
pig
pen
to
weeding
the
garden
were
the
text
books
the
man
balked
at
nothing
indeed
he
seemed
to
find
a
curious
grim
satisfaction
in
accomplishing
the
most
menial
and
disagreeable
tasks
and
when
he
made
mistakes
as
he
often
did
he
laughed
at
himself
with
such
bitter
mocking
humor
that
the
dean
wondered
he
got
me
beat
the
dean
confided
to
stella
there
ai
that
he
wo
tackle
an
i
satisfied
that
the
man
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
before
in
his
life
but
he
seems
to
be
always
tryin
experiments
with
himself
like
he
expected
himself
to
play
the
fool
one
way
or
another
an
wanted
to
see
if
he
would
an
then
when
he
do
he
as
surprised
and
tickled
as
a
kid
the
dean
himself
was
not
at
all
above
assisting
his
new
man
in
those
experiments
and
so
it
happened
that
day
when
patches
had
been
set
to
repairing
the
meadow
pasture
fence
near
the
lower
corrals
the
dean
riding
out
that
way
to
see
how
his
pupil
was
progressing
noticed
a
particularly
shorthorn
bull
that
had
wandered
in
from
the
range
to
water
at
the
house
corral
but
phil
and
his
helpers
were
in
possession
of
the
premises
near
the
watering
trough
and
his
shorthorn
majesty
was
therefore
even
more
than
usual
out
of
patience
with
the
whole
world
the
corrals
were
between
the
bull
and
patches
so
that
the
animal
had
not
noticed
the
man
and
the
dean
chuckling
to
himself
and
without
attracting
patches
attention
quietly
drove
the
beast
into
the
enclosure
and
shut
the
gate
then
riding
around
the
corral
the
dean
called
to
the
young
man
when
patches
stood
beside
his
employer
the
cattleman
said
here
a
blamed
old
bull
that
do
seem
to
be
feelin
very
well
i
got
him
into
the
corral
all
right
but
i
so
fat
i
ca
reach
him
from
the
saddle
i
wish
you
just
halter
him
with
this
rope
so
i
can
lead
him
up
to
the
house
and
let
phil
and
the
boys
see
what
wrong
with
him
patches
took
the
rope
and
started
toward
the
corral
gate
shall
i
put
it
around
his
neck
and
make
a
hitch
over
his
nose
like
you
do
a
horse
he
asked
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
exhibit
his
newly
acquired
knowledge
of
ropes
and
horses
and
things
no
just
tie
it
around
his
horns
the
dean
answered
he
come
all
right
the
bull
seeing
a
man
on
foot
at
the
entrance
to
his
prison
rumbled
a
threat
and
pawed
the
earth
with
angry
strength
for
an
instant
patches
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
gate
paused
to
glance
from
the
animal
that
awaited
his
coming
to
the
dean
who
sat
on
his
horse
just
outside
the
fence
then
he
slipped
inside
the
corral
and
closed
the
gate
behind
him
the
bull
gazed
at
him
a
moment
as
if
amazed
at
the
audacity
of
this
mere
human
then
lowered
his
head
for
the
charge
climb
that
gate
quick
yelled
the
dean
at
the
critical
moment
and
patches
climbed
not
a
second
too
soon
from
his
position
of
safety
he
smiled
cheerfully
at
the
dean
he
came
all
right
did
he
the
dean
full
rounded
front
and
thick
shoulders
shook
with
laughter
while
señor
bull
dared
the
man
on
the
gate
to
come
down
you
crazy
fool
said
the
dean
admiringly
when
he
could
speak
you
know
any
better
than
to
go
in
there
on
foot
but
you
said
you
wanted
him
returned
the
chagrined
patches
what
i
wanted
chuckled
the
dean
was
to
see
if
you
had
nerve
enough
to
tackle
him
to
tell
the
truth
returned
patches
with
a
happy
laugh
exactly
what
interested
me
but
while
the
work
assigned
to
patches
during
those
first
days
of
his
stay
on
the
was
chiefly
those
odd
jobs
which
called
for
little
or
no
experience
his
higher
education
was
by
no
means
neglected
a
wise
and
gentle
old
was
assigned
to
him
and
the
dean
taught
him
the
various
parts
of
his
equipment
their
proper
use
and
how
to
care
for
them
and
every
day
sometimes
in
the
morning
sometimes
late
in
the
afternoon
the
master
found
some
errand
or
business
that
would
necessitate
his
pupil
riding
with
him
when
phil
or
baldwin
would
inquire
about
the
dean
kindergarten
as
they
called
it
the
dean
would
laugh
with
them
but
always
he
would
say
stoutly
just
you
wait
be
as

phil

of
help
in
his
experimentin
baldwin
would
return
dryly
which
saying
indicted
not
only
the
dean
but
phil
and
every
man
on
the
including
little
billy
then
came
that
day
when
patches
was
given
a
task
that
the
dean
assured
him
is
one
of
the
duties
of
even
the
oldest
and
best
qualified
cowboys
patches
was
assigned
to
the
work
of
fenceriding
but
when
the
dean
rode
out
with
his
pupil
early
that
morning
to
where
the
drift
fence
begins
at
the
corner
of
the
big
pasture
and
explained
that
riding
a
fence
meant
in
ranch
language
looking
for
breaks
and
repairing
any
such
when
found
he
did
not
explain
the
peculiarities
of
that
particular
kind
of
fence
i
told
him
to
be
sure
and
be
back
by
night
he
chuckled
as
he
explained
patches
absence
at
dinner
to
the
other
members
of
the
household
that
was
downright
mean
of
you
will
baldwin
chided
stella
with
her
usual
motherly
interest
in
the
comfort
of
her
boys
you
know
the
poor
fellow
will
lose
himself
sure
out
in
that
wild
tailholt
mountain
country
the
boys
laughed
we
find
him
in
the
morning
all
right
mother
reassured
phil
he
can
follow
the
fence
back
ca
he
retorted
the
dean
or
as
far
as
that
goes
old
snip
will
bring
him
home
if
he
knows
enough
to
figger
it
out
or
to
let
snip
have
his
head
said
curly
at
any
rate
the
dean
maintained
he
learn
somethin
about
the
country
an
he
learn
somethin
about
fences
an
mebby
he
learn
somethin
about
horses
an
we
see
whether
he
can
use
his
own
head
or
not
there
nothin
like
givin
a
man
a
chance
to
find
out
things
for
himself
sometimes
besides
think
what
a
chance
he
have
for
some
of
his
experiments
i
bet
a
yearling
steer
that
when
we
do
see
him
again
he
be
tickled
to
death
at
himself
an
wonderin
how
he
had
the
nerve
to
do
it
to
do
what
asked
baldwin
i
do
know
what
chuckled
the
dean
but
he
bound
to
do
some
fool
thing
or
other
just
to
see
if
he
can
and
it
be
somethin
that
nobody
but
him
would
ever
think
of
doin
too
but
honorable
patches
did
not
get
lost
that
day
that
is
not
too
badly
lost
there
was
a
time
though
but
that
does
not
belong
just
here
patches
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
task
assigned
to
him
that
morning
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
trusted
alone
with
a
horse
on
a
mission
that
would
keep
him
the
full
day
in
the
saddle
and
would
take
him
beyond
sight
of
the
ranch
house
very
bravely
he
set
out
equipped
with
his
cowboy
regalia
except
the
riata
which
the
dean
fearing
experiments
had
at
the
last
moment
thoughtfully
borrowed
and
armed
with
a
fencing
tool
and
staples
he
was
armed
too
with
a
in
a
spick
and
span
holster
on
a
shiny
belt
of
bright
cartridges
the
dean
had
insisted
on
this
alleging
that
the
embryo
cowboy
might
want
it
to
kill
a
sick
cow
or
something
patches
wondered
if
he
would
know
a
sick
cow
if
he
should
meet
one
or
how
he
was
to
diagnose
the
case
to
ascertain
if
she
were
sick
enough
to
kill
the
first
thing
he
did
when
the
dean
was
safely
out
of
sight
was
to
dismount
and
examine
his
saddle
girth
always
your
real
king
of
the
cattle
range
is
careful
for
the
foundation
of
his
throne
but
there
was
no
awkwardness
now
when
he
again
swung
to
his
seat
the
young
man
was
in
reality
a
natural
athlete
his
work
had
already
taken
the
soreness
and
stiffness
out
of
his
unaccustomed
muscles
and
he
seemed
as
the
dean
had
said
a
born
horseman
and
as
he
rode
he
looked
about
over
the
surrounding
country
with
an
expression
on
independence
freedom
and
fearlessness
very
different
from
the
manner
of
the
troubled
man
who
had
faced
phil
acton
that
night
on
the
divide
it
was
as
though
the
spirit
of
the
land
was
already
working
its
magic
within
this
man
too
he
patted
the
holster
at
his
side
felt
the
handle
of
the
gun
lovingly
fingered
the
bright
cartridges
in
his
shiny
belt
leaned
sidewise
to
look
admiringly
down
at
his
fringed
leather
chaps
and
spur
ornamented
boot
heels
and
wished
for
his
riata
not
forgetting
meanwhile
to
scan
the
fence
for
places
that
might
need
his
attention
the
guardian
angel
who
cares
for
the
tenderfoot
was
good
to
patches
that
day
and
favored
him
with
many
sagging
wires
and
leaning
or
broken
posts
so
that
he
could
not
ride
far
being
painstaking
and
conscientious
in
his
work
he
had
made
not
more
than
four
miles
by
the
beginning
of
the
afternoon
then
he
found
a
break
that
would
occupy
him
for
two
hours
at
least
with
rueful
eyes
he
surveyed
the
long
stretch
of
dilapidated
fence
it
was
time
he
reflected
that
the
dean
sent
someone
to
look
after
his
property
and
dismounting
he
went
to
work
forgetting
in
his
interest
in
the
fencing
problem
to
insure
his
horse
attendance
now
the
best
of
are
not
above
taking
advantage
of
their
opportunities
perhaps
snip
felt
that
fenceriding
with
a
tenderfoot
was
a
little
beneath
the
dignity
of
his
years
perhaps
he
reasoned
that
this
man
who
was
always
doing
such
strange
things
was
purposely
dismissing
him
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
the
long
watering
trough
and
the
rich
meadow
grass
at
home
or
perhaps
again
the
wise
old
snip
feeling
the
responsibility
of
his
part
in
training
the
dean
pupil
merely
thought
to
give
his
inexperienced
master
a
lesson
however
it
happened
patches
looked
up
from
his
work
some
time
later
to
find
himself
alone
in
consternation
he
stood
looking
about
striving
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
vanished
snip
save
a
lone
buzzard
that
wheeled
in
curious
circles
above
his
head
there
was
no
living
thing
in
sight
as
fast
as
his
heavy
leather
chaps
and
boots
would
permit
he
ran
to
the
top
of
a
knoll
a
hundred
yards
or
so
away
the
wider
range
of
country
that
came
thus
within
the
circle
of
his
vision
was
as
empty
as
it
was
silent
the
buzzard
wheeled
nearer
the
strange
looking
creature
beneath
it
seemed
so
helpless
that
there
might
be
in
the
situation
something
of
vital
interest
to
the
tribe
even
buzzards
must
be
about
their
business
there
are
few
things
more
humiliating
to
professional
riders
of
the
range
than
to
be
left
afoot
and
while
patches
was
far
too
much
a
novice
to
have
acquired
the
peculiar
and
traditional
tastes
and
habits
of
the
clan
of
which
he
had
that
morning
felt
himself
a
member
he
was
in
this
the
equal
of
the
best
of
them
he
thought
of
himself
walking
shamefaced
into
the
presence
of
the
dean
and
reporting
the
loss
of
the
horse
the
animal
might
be
recovered
he
supposed
for
he
was
still
patches
thought
inside
the
pasture
which
that
fence
enclosed
still
there
was
a
chance
that
the
runaway
would
escape
through
some
break
and
never
be
found
in
any
case
the
vision
of
the
grinning
cowboys
was
not
an
attractive
one
but
at
least
thought
the
amateur
cowboy
he
would
finish
the
work
entrusted
to
him
he
might
lose
a
horse
for
the
dean
but
the
dean
fence
should
be
repaired
so
he
set
to
work
with
a
will
and
finishing
that
particular
break
set
out
on
foot
to
follow
the
fence
around
the
field
and
so
back
to
the
lane
that
would
lead
him
to
the
buildings
and
corrals
of
the
home
ranch
for
an
hour
he
trudged
along
making
hard
work
of
it
in
his
chaps
boots
and
spurs
stopping
now
and
then
to
drive
a
staple
or
brace
a
post
the
country
was
growing
wilder
and
more
broken
with
cedar
timber
on
the
ridges
and
here
and
there
a
pine
occasionally
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
black
forbidding
walls
of
tailholt
mountain
but
patches
did
not
know
that
it
was
tailholt
he
only
thought
that
he
knew
in
which
direction
the
home
ranch
lay
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
long
long
way
to
the
corner
of
the
field
it
must
be
a
big
pasture
indeed
the
afternoon
was
well
on
when
he
paused
on
the
summit
of
another
ridge
to
rest
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
life
been
quite
so
warm
his
legs
ached
he
was
tired
and
thirsty
and
hungry
it
was
so
still
that
the
silence
hurt
and
that
fence
corner
was
nowhere
in
sight
he
could
not
now
reach
home
before
dark
even
should
he
turn
back
which
he
decided
grimly
he
would
not
do
he
would
ride
that
fence
if
he
camped
three
nights
on
the
journey
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
waving
his
hat
hallooing
and
yelling
like
a
madman
two
horsemen
were
riding
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
along
the
slope
of
the
next
ridge
at
the
edge
of
the
timber
in
vain
patches
strove
to
attract
their
attention
if
they
heard
him
they
gave
no
sign
and
presently
he
saw
them
turn
ride
in
among
the
cedars
and
disappear
in
desperation
he
ran
along
the
fence
down
the
hill
across
the
narrow
little
valley
and
up
the
ridge
over
which
the
riders
had
gone
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
he
stopped
again
to
spend
the
last
of
his
breath
in
another
series
of
wild
shouts
but
there
was
no
answer
nor
could
he
be
sure
even
which
way
the
horsemen
had
gone
dropping
down
in
the
shade
of
a
cedar
exhausted
by
his
strenuous
exertion
and
wet
with
honest
perspiration
he
struggled
for
breath
and
fanned
his
hot
face
with
his
hat
perhaps
he
even
used
some
of
the
cowboy
words
that
he
had
heard
curly
and
bob
employ
when
little
billy
was
not
around
after
the
noise
of
his
frantic
efforts
the
silence
was
more
oppressive
than
ever
the
ranch
house
was
somewhere
endless
miles
away
then
a
faint
sound
in
the
narrow
valley
below
him
caught
his
ear
turning
quickly
he
looked
back
the
way
he
had
come
was
he
dreaming
or
was
it
all
just
a
part
of
the
magic
of
that
wonderful
land
a
young
woman
was
riding
toward
him
coming
at
an
easy
swinging
lope
and
following
at
the
end
of
a
riata
was
the
cheerfully
wise
and
philosophic
snip
patches
first
thought
when
he
had
sufficiently
recovered
i
from
his
amazement
to
think
at
all
was
that
the
woman
rode
as
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
ride
before
dressed
in
the
divided
skirt
of
corduroy
the
loose
soft
gray
shirt
gauntleted
gloves
mannish
felt
hat
and
boots
usual
to
arizona
horsewomen
she
seemed
as
much
at
ease
in
the
saddle
as
any
cowboy
in
the
land
and
indeed
she
was
as
she
came
up
the
slope
the
man
in
the
shade
of
the
cedar
saw
that
she
was
young
her
lithe
beautifully
developed
body
yielded
to
the
movement
of
the
spirited
horse
she
rode
with
the
unspoiled
grace
of
health
and
youth
still
nearer
and
he
saw
her
clear
cheeks
glowing
with
the
exercise
and
excitement
her
soft
brown
hair
under
the
wide
brim
of
the
gray
sombrero
and
her
dark
eyes
shining
with
the
fun
of
her
adventure
then
she
saw
him
and
smiled
and
patches
remembered
what
the
dean
had
said
if
there
a
man
in
yavapai
county
who
would
ride
the
hoofs
off
the
best
horse
in
his
outfit
to
win
a
smile
from
kitty
reid
he
ought
to
be
lynched
as
the
man
stood
hat
in
hand
she
checked
her
horse
and
in
a
voice
that
matched
the
smile
so
full
of
fun
and
the
clean
joy
of
living
greeted
him
you
are
mr
honorable
patches
are
you
not
patches
bowed
miss
reid
i
believe
she
frankly
looked
her
surprise
why
how
did
you
know
me
your
good
friend
baldwin
described
you
he
smiled
she
colored
and
laughed
to
hide
her
slight
embarrassment
the
dear
old
dean
is
prejudiced
i
fear
prejudiced
he
may
be
patches
admitted
but
his
judgement
is
unquestionable
and
he
added
gently
as
her
face
grew
grave
and
her
chin
lifted
slightly
his
confidence
in
any
man
might
be
considered
an
endorsement
do
you
think
indeed
yes
she
agreed
heartily
her
slight
coldness
vanishing
instantly
the
dean
and
stella
told
me
all
about
you
this
afternoon
or
i
should
not
have
ventured
to
introduce
myself
i
am
very
pleased
to
meet
you
patches
she
finished
with
a
mock
formality
that
was
delightful
and
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
miss
reid
for
so
many
reasons
that
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
of
them
he
responded
laughing
and
now
may
i
ask
what
good
magic
brings
you
like
a
fairy
in
the
story
book
to
the
rescue
of
a
poor
stranger
in
the
hour
of
his
despair
where
did
you
find
my
faithless
snip
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
me
where
is
the
ranch
how
many
miles
is
it
to
the
nearest
water
is
it
possible
for
me
to
get
home
in
time
for
supper
looking
down
at
him
she
laughed
as
only
kitty
reid
could
laugh
you
making
fun
of
me
he
charged
they
all
do
and
i
do
blame
them
in
the
least
i
have
been
laughing
at
myself
all
day
i
answer
your
last
question
first
she
returned
yes
you
can
easily
reach
the
in
time
for
supper
if
you
start
at
once
i
will
explain
the
magic
as
we
ride
you
are
going
to
show
me
the
way
he
cried
eagerly
starting
toward
his
horse
i
really
think
it
would
be
best
she
said
demurely
now
i
know
you
are
a
good
fairy
or
a
guardian
angel
or
something
like
that
he
returned
setting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
to
mount
then
suddenly
he
paused
with
wait
a
minute
please
i
nearly
forgot
and
very
carefully
he
examined
the
saddle
girth
to
see
that
it
was
tight
if
you
had
remembered
to
throw
your
bridle
rein
over
snip
head
when
you
left
him
you
would
have
needed
a
guardian
angel
this
time
she
said
he
looked
at
her
blankly
over
the
patient
snip
back
and
so
that
was
what
made
him
go
away
i
knew
i
had
done
some
silly
thing
that
i
ought
not
that
the
only
thing
about
myself
that
i
am
always
perfectly
sure
of
he
added
as
he
mounted
you
see
i
can
always
depend
upon
myself
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
it
was
that
bad
place
in
the
fence
that
did
it
he
pulled
up
his
horse
suddenly
as
they
were
starting
and
that
reminds
me
there
is
one
thing
you
positively
must
tell
me
before
i
can
go
a
foot
even
toward
supper
how
much
farther
is
it
to
the
corner
of
this
field
she
looked
at
him
in
pretty
amazement
to
the
corner
of
this
field
yes
i
knew
of
course
that
if
i
followed
the
fence
it
was
bound
to
lead
me
around
the
field
and
so
back
to
where
i
started
that
why
i
kept
on
i
thought
i
could
finish
the
job
and
get
home
even
if
snip
did
compel
me
to
ride
the
fence
on
foot
but
do
you
know
that
this
is
a
drift
fence
she
asked
her
eyes
dancing
with
fun
that
what
the
dean
called
it
he
admitted
but
if
it
drifting
anywhere
it
going
end
on
perhaps
that
why
i
could
catch
the
corner
but
there
is
no
corner
to
a
drift
fence
she
cried
no
corner
she
shook
her
head
as
if
not
trusting
herself
to
speak
and
it
does
go
around
anything
there
is
no
field
again
she
shook
her
head
just
runs
away
out
in
the
country
somewhere
and
stops
she
nodded
it
must
be
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
from
here
to
the
end
well
of
all
the
silly
fences
he
exclaimed
looking
away
to
the
mountain
peaks
toward
which
he
had
been
so
laboriously
making
his
way
honestly
now
do
you
think
that
is
any
way
for
a
respectable
fence
to
act
and
the
dean
told
me
to
be
sure
and
get
home
before
dark
then
they
laughed
together
laughed
until
their
horses
must
have
wondered
as
they
rode
on
she
explained
the
purpose
of
the
drift
fence
and
how
it
came
to
an
end
so
many
miles
away
and
so
far
from
water
that
the
cattle
do
not
usually
find
their
way
around
it
and
now
the
magic
he
said
you
have
made
a
most
unreasonable
unconventional
and
altogether
foolish
fence
appear
reasonable
proper
and
perfectly
sane
please
explain
your
coming
with
snip
to
my
relief
which
was
also
unreasonable
unconventional
and
altogether
foolish
she
questioned
which
was
altogether
wonderful
unexpected
and
delightful
he
retorted
it
is
all
perfectly
simple
she
explained
being
rather
she
hesitated
well
rather
sick
of
too
much
of
nothing
at
all
you
know
i
went
over
to
the
right
after
dinner
to
visit
a
little
with
stella
professionally
professionally
he
asked
she
nodded
brightly
for
the
good
of
my
soul
stella
a
famous
soul
doctor
the
best
ever
except
one
and
she
lives
far
away
away
back
east
in
cleveland
ohio
yes
i
know
her
too
he
said
gravely
and
while
they
laughed
at
the
absurdity
of
his
assertion
they
did
not
know
until
long
afterward
how
literally
true
it
was
of
course
i
knew
about
you
she
continued
phil
told
me
how
you
tried
to
ride
that
unbroken
horse
the
last
time
he
was
at
our
house
phil
thinks
you
are
quite
a
wonderful
man
no
doubt
said
patches
mockingly
i
must
have
given
a
remarkable
exhibition
on
that
occasion
he
was
wondering
just
how
much
phil
had
told
her
and
so
you
see
she
continued
i
could
very
well
help
being
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
stranger
who
had
come
among
us
besides
our
traditional
western
hospitality
demanded
it
do
you
think
oh
certainly
certainly
you
could
really
do
nothing
less
than
inquire
about
me
he
agreed
politely
and
so
you
see
stella
quite
restored
my
soul
health
or
at
least
afforded
me
temporary
relief
he
met
the
quizzing
teasing
laughing
look
in
her
eyes
blankly
you
are
making
fun
of
me
again
he
said
humbly
i
know
i
ought
to
laugh
at
myself
but
why
do
you
understand
she
cried
stella
administered
a
generous
dose
of
talk
about
the
only
new
thing
that
has
happened
in
this
neighborhood
for
months
and
months
and
months
meaning
me
he
asked
well
are
you
not
she
retorted
i
guess
i
am
he
smiled
well
and
then
what
why
then
i
came
away
feeling
much
better
of
course
yes
i
was
feeling
so
much
better
i
decided
i
would
go
home
a
roundabout
way
perhaps
to
the
top
of
black
hill
perhaps
up
horse
wash
where
i
might
meet
father
who
would
be
on
his
way
home
from
fair
oaks
where
he
went
this
morning
i
see
well
so
i
met
snip
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
i
knew
of
course
that
old
snip
would
be
your
horse
she
smiled
as
though
to
rob
her
words
of
any
implied
criticism
of
his
horsemanship
exactly
he
agreed
understandingly
and
i
was
afraid
that
something
might
have
happened
though
i
see
how
that
could
be
either
with
snip
and
so
i
caught
him
he
interrupted
eagerly
how
why
with
my
riata
she
returned
in
a
tone
wondering
at
his
question
you
caught
my
horse
with
your
riata
he
repeated
slowly
and
pray
how
should
i
have
caught
him
she
asked
but
but
did
he
she
laughed
of
course
he
ran
they
all
do
that
once
they
get
away
from
you
but
snip
never
could
outrun
my
midnight
she
retorted
he
shook
his
head
slowly
looking
at
her
with
frank
admiration
as
though
for
the
first
time
he
understood
what
a
rare
and
wonderful
creature
she
was
and
you
can
ride
and
rope
like
that
he
said
doubtfully
she
flushed
hotly
and
there
was
a
spark
of
fire
in
the
brown
eyes
i
suppose
you
are
thinking
that
i
am
coarse
and
mannish
and
all
that
she
said
with
spirit
by
your
standards
patches
i
should
have
ridden
back
to
the
house
screaming
ladylike
for
help
no
no
he
protested
that
not
fair
i
was
thinking
how
wonderful
you
are
why
i
would
give
what
would
i
give
to
be
able
to
do
a
thing
like
that
there
was
no
mistaking
his
earnestness
and
kitty
was
all
sunshine
again
pardoning
him
with
a
smile
you
see
she
explained
i
have
always
lived
here
except
my
three
years
at
school
father
taught
me
to
use
a
riata
as
he
taught
me
to
ride
and
shoot
because
well
because
it
all
a
part
of
this
life
and
very
useful
sometimes
just
as
it
is
useful
to
know
about
hotels
and
and
taxicabs
in
that
other
part
of
the
world
i
understand
he
said
gently
it
was
stupid
of
me
to
notice
it
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
the
story
of
my
rescue
you
had
just
roped
snip
while
he
was
doing
his
best
to
outrun
midnight
simple
and
easy
as
calling
a
taxi
two
thousand
euclid
avenue
please
and
there
you
are
oh
do
you
know
cleveland
she
cried
for
an
instant
he
was
confused
then
he
said
easily
everybody
has
heard
of
the
famous
euclid
avenue
but
how
did
you
guess
where
snip
had
left
me
why
stella
had
told
me
that
you
were
riding
the
drift
fence
she
answered
tactfully
ignoring
the
evasion
of
her
question
i
just
followed
the
fence
so
there
was
no
magic
about
it
at
all
you
see
i
not
so
sure
about
the
magic
he
returned
slowly
this
is
such
a
wonderful
country
to
me
that
one
can
never
be
quite
sure
about
anything
at
least
i
ca
but
perhaps
that
because
i
am
such
a
new
thing
and
do
you
like
it
she
asked
frankly
curious
about
him
like
being
a
new
thing
he
parried
yes
and
no
i
mean
do
you
like
this
wonderful
country
as
you
call
it
i
admire
the
people
who
belong
to
it
tremendously
he
returned
i
never
met
such
men
before
or
such
women
he
finished
with
a
smile
but
do
you
like
it
she
persisted
do
you
like
the
life
your
work
would
you
be
satisfied
to
live
here
always
yes
and
no
he
answered
again
hesitatingly
oh
well
she
said
with
he
thought
a
little
bitterness
and
rebellion
it
does
really
matter
to
you
whether
you
like
it
or
not
because
are
a
man
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
your
environment
you
can
leave
it
go
away
somewhere
else
make
yourself
a
part
of
some
other
life
he
shook
his
head
wondering
a
little
at
her
earnestness
that
does
not
always
follow
can
a
man
just
because
he
is
a
man
always
have
or
do
just
what
he
likes
if
he
strong
enough
she
insisted
but
a
woman
must
always
do
what
other
people
like
he
was
sure
now
that
she
was
speaking
rebelliously
she
continued
ca
you
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
this
life
here
go
away
yes
but
not
necessarily
to
any
life
i
might
desire
perhaps
some
sheriff
wants
me
perhaps
i
am
an
escaped
convict
perhaps
oh
a
thousand
things
she
laughed
aloud
in
spite
of
her
serious
mood
what
nonsense
but
why
nonsense
what
do
you
and
your
friends
know
of
me
we
know
that
you
are
not
that
kind
of
a
man
she
retorted
warmly
because
she
hesitated
well
because
you
are
that
sort
of
a
man
are
you
sure
you
do
mean
because
i
am
not
man
enough
to
make
myself
wanted
very
badly
even
by
the
sheriff
he
asked
and
kitty
could
not
mistake
the
bitterness
in
his
voice
why
mr
patches
she
cried
how
could
you
think
i
meant
such
a
thing
forgive
me
i
was
only
wondering
foolishly
what
you
a
man
of
education
and
culture
could
find
in
this
rough
life
that
would
appeal
to
you
in
any
way
my
curiosity
is
unpardonable
i
suppose
but
you
must
know
that
we
are
all
wondering
why
you
are
here
i
do
not
blame
you
he
returned
with
that
smile
as
though
he
were
laughing
at
himself
i
told
you
i
could
always
be
depended
upon
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
you
see
i
am
doing
it
now
i
do
mind
telling
you
this
much
that
i
am
here
for
the
same
reason
that
you
went
to
visit
baldwin
this
afternoon
for
the
good
of
your
soul
she
asked
gently
exactly
he
returned
gravely
for
the
good
of
my
soul
well
then
mr
honorable
patches
here
to
your
soul
good
health
she
cried
brightly
checking
her
horse
and
holding
out
her
hand
we
part
here
you
can
see
the
buildings
yonder
i
go
this
way
he
looked
his
pleasure
as
he
clasped
her
hand
in
hearty
understanding
of
the
friendship
offered
thank
you
miss
reid
i
still
maintain
that
the
dean
judgment
is
unquestionable
she
was
not
at
all
displeased
with
his
reply
by
the
way
she
said
as
if
to
prove
her
friendship
i
suppose
you
know
what
to
expect
from
uncle
will
and
the
boys
when
they
learn
of
your
little
adventure
i
do
he
answered
as
if
resigned
to
anything
and
do
you
enjoy
making
fun
for
them
i
assure
you
miss
reid
i
am
very
human
well
then
why
do
you
turn
the
laugh
on
them
but
how
they
are
expecting
you
to
get
into
some
sort
of
a
scrape
do
you
think
they
are
always
expecting
that
and
he
added
with
that
droll
touch
in
his
voice
i
must
say
i
rarely
disappoint
them
i
suspect
she
continued
thoughtfully
that
the
dean
purposely
did
not
explain
that
drift
fence
to
you
he
has
established
precedents
that
would
justify
my
thinking
so
admit
well
then
why
do
you
ride
cheerfully
home
and
report
the
progress
of
your
work
as
though
nothing
had
happened
you
mean
that
you
wo
tell
he
cried
she
nodded
gaily
i
told
them
this
afternoon
that
it
was
fair
for
you
to
have
no
one
but
stella
on
your
side
what
a
good
samaritan
you
are
you
put
me
under
an
everlasting
obligation
to
you
all
right
she
laughed
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
shall
hold
that
debt
against
you
until
some
day
when
i
am
in
dreadful
need
and
then
i
shall
demand
payment
in
full
and
once
again
kitty
had
spoken
in
jest
words
that
held
for
them
both
had
they
but
known
great
significance
patches
watched
until
she
was
out
of
sight
then
he
made
his
way
happily
to
the
house
to
receive
with
a
guilty
conscience
but
with
a
light
heart
congratulations
and
compliments
upon
his
safe
return
that
evening
phil
disappeared
somewhere
in
the
twilight
and
a
little
later
jim
reid
rode
into
the
dooryard
the
owner
of
the
was
a
big
man
tall
and
heavy
outspoken
and
somewhat
gruff
with
a
manner
that
to
strangers
often
seemed
near
to
overbearing
when
patches
was
introduced
the
big
cattleman
looked
him
over
suspiciously
spoke
a
short
word
in
response
to
commonplace
and
abruptly
turned
his
back
to
converse
with
the
members
of
the
household
for
an
hour
perhaps
they
chatted
about
matters
of
general
interest
as
neighbors
will
then
the
caller
arose
to
go
and
the
dean
walked
with
him
to
his
horse
when
the
two
men
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
people
on
the
porch
reid
asked
in
a
low
voice
noticed
any
stock
that
did
look
right
lately
will
no
you
see
we
have
been
ridin
scarcely
any
since
the
fourth
phil
and
the
boys
have
been
busy
with
the
horses
every
day
an
this
new
man
do
count
you
know
who
is
he
anyway
asked
reid
bluntly
i
do
know
any
more
than
that
he
says
his
name
is
patches
funny
name
grunted
jim
yes
but
there
a
lot
of
funny
names
jim
the
dean
answered
quietly
i
do
know
as
patches
is
any
funnier
than
skinner
or
foote
or
hogg
or
a
hundred
other
names
when
you
come
to
think
about
it
we
just
never
happened
to
hear
it
before
that
all
where
did
you
pick
him
up
he
just
came
along
an
wanted
work
he
green
as
they
make
but
willin
an
he
got
good
sense
too
i
go
slow
takin
strangers
in
said
the
big
man
bluntly
shucks
retorted
the
dean
some
of
the
best
men
i
ever
had
was
strangers
when
i
hired
bein
a
stranger
ai
nothin
against
a
man
you
and
me
would
be
strangers
if
we
was
to
go
many
miles
from
williamson
valley
patches
is
a
good
man
i
tell
you
i
stand
for
him
all
right
why
he
been
out
all
day
alone
ridin
the
drift
fence
just
as
good
any
the
drift
fence
yes
it
in
pretty
bad
shape
in
places
yes
an
i
ran
onto
a
calf
over
in
horse
wash
this
afternoon
not
four
hundred
yards
from
the
fence
on
the
tailholt
side
with
the
tailholt
iron
an
i
bet
a
thousand
dollars
it
belongs
to
a
cow
what
makes
you
think
it
was
mine
asked
the
dean
calmly
because
it
looked
mighty
like
some
of
your
hereford
stock
an
because
i
came
on
through
the
horse
wash
gate
an
about
a
half
mile
on
this
side
i
found
one
of
your
cows
that
had
just
lost
her
calf
they
know
we
busy
an
ai
ridin
much
i
reckon
mused
the
dean
if
i
was
you
i
put
some
hand
that
i
knew
to
ridin
that
drift
fence
returned
jim
significantly
as
he
mounted
his
horse
to
go
you
plumb
wrong
jim
returned
the
dean
earnestly
why
the
man
do
know
a
from
a
or
a
it
your
business
will
i
just
thought
i
tell
you
growled
reid
jim
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
ridin
over
chapter
vii
things
that
endure
when
kitty
reid
told
patches
that
it
was
her
soul
sickness
from
too
much
of
nothing
at
all
that
had
sent
her
to
visit
baldwin
that
afternoon
she
had
spoken
more
in
earnest
than
in
jest
more
than
this
she
had
gone
to
the
hoping
to
meet
the
stranger
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
much
phil
had
told
kitty
that
she
would
like
patches
as
phil
had
put
it
the
man
spoke
her
language
he
could
talk
to
her
of
people
and
books
and
those
things
of
which
the
williamson
valley
folk
knew
so
little
but
as
she
rode
slowly
homeward
after
leaving
patches
she
found
herself
of
two
minds
regarding
the
incident
she
had
enjoyed
meeting
the
man
he
had
interested
and
amused
her
had
taken
her
out
of
herself
for
she
was
not
slow
to
recognize
that
the
man
really
did
belong
to
that
world
which
was
so
far
from
the
world
of
her
childhood
and
she
was
glad
for
the
little
adventure
that
for
one
afternoon
at
least
had
broken
the
dull
wearying
monotony
of
her
daily
life
but
the
stranger
by
the
very
fact
of
his
belonging
to
that
other
world
had
stimulated
her
desire
for
those
things
which
in
her
home
life
and
environment
she
so
greatly
missed
he
had
somehow
seemed
to
magnify
the
almost
unbearable
commonplace
narrowness
of
her
daily
routine
he
had
made
her
even
more
restless
disturbed
and
dissatisfied
it
had
been
to
her
as
when
one
in
some
foreign
country
meets
a
citizen
from
one
old
home
town
and
for
this
kitty
was
genuinely
sorry
she
did
not
wish
to
feel
as
she
did
about
her
home
and
the
things
that
made
the
world
of
those
she
loved
she
had
tried
honestly
to
still
the
unrest
and
to
deny
the
longing
she
had
wished
many
times
since
her
return
from
the
east
that
she
had
never
left
her
home
for
those
three
years
in
school
and
yet
those
years
had
meant
much
to
her
they
had
been
wonderful
years
but
they
seemed
somehow
now
that
they
were
past
and
she
was
home
again
to
have
brought
her
only
that
unrest
and
longing
from
the
beginning
of
her
years
until
that
first
great
crisis
in
her
life
her
going
away
to
school
this
world
into
which
she
was
born
had
been
to
kitty
an
world
the
days
of
her
childhood
had
been
as
carefree
and
joyous
almost
as
the
days
of
the
young
things
of
her
father
roaming
herds
as
her
girlhood
years
advanced
under
her
mother
wise
companionship
and
careful
teaching
she
had
grown
into
her
share
of
the
household
duties
and
into
a
knowledge
of
woman
part
in
the
life
to
which
she
belonged
as
naturally
as
her
girlish
form
had
put
on
the
graces
of
young
womanhood
the
things
that
filled
the
days
of
her
father
and
mother
and
the
days
of
her
neighbors
and
friends
had
filled
her
days
the
things
that
were
all
in
all
to
those
she
loved
had
been
all
in
all
to
her
and
always
through
those
years
from
her
earliest
childhood
to
her
young
womanhood
there
was
phil
her
playmate
schoolmate
protector
hero
slave
that
phil
should
be
her
boy
sweetheart
and
young
man
lover
had
seemed
as
natural
to
kitty
as
her
relation
to
her
parents
there
had
never
been
anyone
else
but
phil
there
never
could
be
she
was
sure
in
those
days
anyone
else
in
kitty
heart
that
afternoon
as
she
rode
so
indifferent
to
the
life
that
called
from
every
bush
and
tree
and
grassy
hill
and
distant
mountain
there
was
sweet
regret
deep
and
sincere
for
those
years
that
were
now
to
her
so
irrevocably
gone
kitty
did
not
know
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
ever
wholly
escape
the
things
that
belonged
to
her
childhood
and
youth
those
things
of
her
girlhood
out
of
which
her
heart
and
soul
had
been
fashioned
were
as
interwoven
in
the
fabric
of
her
being
as
the
vitality
strength
and
purity
of
the
clean
wholesome
outdoor
life
of
those
same
years
were
wrought
into
the
glowing
health
and
vigor
and
beauty
of
her
physical
womanhood
and
then
had
come
those
other
years
the
maturing
ripening
years
when
from
the
simple
primitive
and
enduring
elements
of
life
she
had
gone
to
live
amid
complex
cultivated
and
largely
fanciful
standards
and
values
in
that
land
of
kitty
birth
a
man
is
measured
by
the
measure
of
his
manhood
a
woman
is
ranked
by
the
quality
of
her
womanhood
strength
and
courage
sincerity
honesty
usefulness
these
were
the
prime
essentials
of
the
man
life
that
kitty
had
in
those
years
of
her
girlhood
known
and
these
too
in
their
feminine
expressions
were
the
essentials
of
the
woman
life
but
from
these
the
young
woman
had
gone
to
be
educated
in
a
world
where
other
things
are
of
first
importance
she
had
gone
to
be
taught
that
these
are
not
the
essential
elements
of
manhood
and
womanhood
or
at
least
if
she
was
not
to
be
deliberately
so
taught
these
things
would
be
so
ignored
and
neglected
and
overlooked
in
her
training
that
the
effect
on
her
character
would
be
the
same
in
that
new
world
she
was
to
learn
that
men
and
women
are
not
to
be
measured
by
the
standards
of
manhood
and
womanhood
that
they
were
to
be
rated
not
for
strength
but
for
culture
not
for
courage
but
for
intellectual
cleverness
not
for
sincerity
but
for
manners
not
for
honesty
but
for
success
not
for
usefulness
but
for
social
position
which
is
most
often
determined
by
the
degree
of
uselessness
it
was
as
though
the
handler
of
gems
were
to
attach
no
value
whatever
to
the
weight
of
the
diamond
itself
but
to
fix
the
worth
of
the
stone
wholly
by
the
cutting
and
polish
that
the
crystal
might
receive
at
first
kitty
had
been
excited
bewildered
and
fascinated
by
the
glittering
sparkling
life
then
she
had
grown
weary
and
homesick
and
then
as
the
months
had
passed
and
she
had
been
drawn
more
and
more
by
association
and
environment
into
the
world
of
she
too
began
to
regard
the
sparkle
of
the
diamond
as
the
determining
factor
in
the
value
of
the
gem
and
when
the
young
woman
had
achieved
this
they
called
her
education
finished
and
sent
her
back
to
the
land
over
which
granite
mountain
gray
and
grim
and
with
its
ranks
of
sentinel
bills
keeps
enduring
and
unchanging
watch
during
those
first
glad
days
of
kitty
homecoming
she
had
been
eagerly
interested
in
everything
the
trivial
bits
of
news
about
the
small
doings
of
her
old
friends
had
been
delightful
the
home
life
with
its
simple
routine
and
its
sweet
companionship
had
been
restful
and
satisfying
the
very
scenes
of
her
girlhood
had
seemed
to
welcome
her
with
a
spirit
of
genuineness
and
steadfastness
that
had
made
her
feel
as
one
entering
a
safe
home
harbor
after
a
long
and
adventurous
voyage
to
and
lands
and
phil
in
the
virile
strength
of
his
manhood
in
the
simple
bigness
of
his
character
and
in
his
enduring
and
unchanging
love
had
made
her
feel
his
likeness
to
the
primitive
land
of
his
birth
but
when
the
glad
excitement
of
those
first
days
of
her
return
were
past
when
the
meetings
with
old
friends
were
over
and
the
tales
of
their
doings
exhausted
then
kitty
began
to
realize
what
her
education
as
they
called
it
really
meant
the
lessons
of
those
three
years
were
not
to
be
erased
from
her
life
as
one
would
erase
a
mistake
in
a
problem
or
a
misspelled
word
the
tastes
habits
of
thought
and
standards
of
life
the
acquirement
of
which
constituted
her
culture
would
not
be
denied
it
was
inevitable
that
there
should
be
a
clash
between
the
claims
of
her
home
life
and
the
claims
of
that
life
to
which
she
now
felt
that
she
also
belonged
however
odious
comparisons
may
be
they
are
many
times
inevitable
loyally
kitty
tried
to
magnify
the
worth
of
those
things
that
in
her
girlhood
had
been
the
supreme
things
in
her
life
but
try
as
she
might
they
were
now
in
comparison
with
those
things
which
her
culture
placed
first
of
trivial
importance
the
virile
strength
and
glowing
health
of
phil
unspoiled
manhood
beautiful
as
the
vigorous
life
of
one
of
the
wild
horses
from
which
he
had
his
nickname
were
overshadowed
now
by
the
young
man
inability
to
clothe
his
splendid
body
in
that
fashion
which
her
culture
demanded
his
simple
and
primitive
views
of
life
as
natural
as
the
instinct
which
governs
all
creatures
in
his
world
were
now
unrefined
ignoble
inelegant
his
fine
nature
and
unembarrassed
intelligence
which
found
in
the
wealth
of
realities
amid
which
he
lived
abundant
food
for
his
intellectual
life
and
which
enabled
him
to
see
clearly
observe
closely
and
think
with
such
directness
beside
the
intellectuality
of
those
schooled
in
the
thoughts
of
others
appeared
as
ignorance
and
illiteracy
the
very
fineness
and
gentleness
of
his
nature
were
now
the
distinguishing
marks
of
an
uncouth
and
awkward
rustic
with
all
her
woman
heart
kitty
had
fought
against
these
comparisons
and
continued
to
make
them
everything
in
her
nature
that
belonged
to
granite
mountain
that
was
in
short
the
product
of
that
land
answered
to
phil
call
as
instinctively
as
the
life
of
that
land
calls
and
answers
its
mating
calls
everything
that
she
had
acquired
in
those
three
years
of
a
more
advanced
civilization
denied
and
repulsed
him
and
now
her
meeting
with
patches
had
stirred
the
warring
forces
to
renewed
activity
and
in
the
distracting
turmoil
of
her
thoughts
she
found
herself
hating
the
land
she
loved
loathing
the
life
that
appealed
to
her
with
such
insistent
power
despising
those
whom
she
so
dearly
esteemed
and
honored
and
denying
the
affection
of
which
she
was
proud
with
a
true
woman
tender
pride
kitty
was
aroused
from
her
absorption
by
the
shrill
boyish
yells
of
her
two
younger
brothers
who
catching
sight
of
their
sister
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
low
hills
that
edge
the
meadow
bottom
lands
were
charging
recklessly
down
upon
her
as
the
clatter
and
rumble
of
those
eight
flying
hoofs
drew
nearer
and
nearer
midnight
too
came
alive
as
the
cowboys
say
and
tossed
his
head
and
pranced
with
eager
impatience
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
all
the
afternoon
demanded
jimmy
with
authority
as
his
pony
slid
to
a
halt
within
a
foot
or
two
of
his
sister
horse
and
we
wanted
you
to
go
with
us
to
see
our
coyote
traps

conny
two
years
younger
than
his

pinto
executed
a
like
maneuver
on
the
other
side
of
the
excited
midnight
and
where

asked
the
young
woman
mischievously
as
she
smilingly
welcomed

vigorous
lads

the
other
member
of

trio
of

his
brothers
jimmy

coaxed
him
into
the

with

painful
and
despairing
expression
was
blissfully
ignored
as
jimmy
stealthily
flicked
the
long
romal
at
the
end
of
his
bridle
reins
against
midnight

observed
the
tickled
youngster
as

and
shortening
his

i

oak
bush
yonder
good
enough
you
on
they
shouted
in
chorus
and
loped
away
as
they
passed
the
handicap
mark
another
shrill
defiant
yell
came
floating
back
to
where
kitty
sat
reining
in
her
impatient
midnight
at
the
signal
the
two
ponies
leaped
from
a
lope
into
a
full
run
while
kitty
loosed
the
restraining
rein
and
the
black
horse
stretched
away
in
pursuit
spurs
ring
shouting
entreating
the
two
lads
urged
their
sturdy
mounts
toward
the
goal
and
the
pintos
answered
gamely
with
all
that
they
had
over
knolls
and
washes
across
arroyos
and
gullies
they
flew
and
eager
neck
and
neck
while
behind
them
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
black
with
body
low
head
outstretched
and
limbs
that
moved
apparently
with
the
timed
regularity
and
driving
power
of
a
locomotive
piston
rod
as
she
passed
them
kitty
shouted
a
merry
come
on
which
they
answered
with
redoubled
exertion
and
another
yell
of
hearty
boyish
admiration
for
the
victorious
midnight
and
his
beautiful
rider
doggone
that
black
streak
exclaimed
jimmy
his
eyes
dancing
with
fun
as
they
pulled
up
at
the
corral
gate
he
opens
and
shuts
like
a
blamed
ol
jack
rabbit
commented
conny
seemed
like
we
was
just
still
watchin
you
go
by
kitty
laughed
teasingly
and
unconsciously
slipped
into
the
vernacular
as
she
returned
did
you
kids
think
you
were
you
just
wait
miss
retorted
the
grinning
jimmy
as
he
opened
the
big
gate
i
get
a
horse
some
day
that
run
circles
around
that
black
and
then
as
they
dismounted
at
the
door
of
the
saddle
room
in
the
big
barn
he
added
generously
you
scoot
on
up
to
the
house
kitty
take
care
of
midnight
it
must
be
gettin
near
supper
time
an
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
raw
dog
at
which
alarming
statement
kitty
promptly
scooted
stopping
only
long
enough
at
the
windmill
pump
for
a
cool
refreshing
drink
reid
with
sturdy
little
jack
helping
was
already
busy
in
the
kitchen
she
was
a
motherly
woman
rather
below
kitty
height
and
inclined
somewhat
to
a
comfortable
stoutness
in
her
face
was
the
gentle
strength
and
patience
of
those
whose
years
have
been
spent
in
without
the
hardness
that
is
sometimes
seen
in
the
faces
of
those
whose
love
is
not
great
enough
to
soften
their
tail
one
knew
by
the
light
in
her
eyes
whenever
she
spoke
of
kitty
or
indeed
whenever
the
girl
name
was
mentioned
how
large
a
place
her
only
daughter
held
in
her
mother
heart
while
the
two
worked
together
at
their
homely
task
the
girl
related
in
trivial
detail
the
news
of
the
neighborhood
and
repeated
faithfully
the
talk
she
had
had
with
the
mistress
of
the
answering
all
her
mother
questions
replying
with
careful
interest
to
the
older
woman
comments
relating
all
that
was
known
or
guessed
or
observed
regarding
the
stranger
but
of
her
meeting
with
patches
kitty
said
little
only
that
she
had
met
him
as
she
was
coming
home
all
during
the
evening
meal
too
patches
was
the
principal
topic
of
the
conversation
though
reid
who
had
arrived
home
just
in
time
for
supper
said
little
when
supper
was
over
and
the
evening
work
finished
kitty
sat
on
the
porch
in
the
twilight
looking
away
across
the
wide
valley
meadows
toward
the
light
that
shone
where
the
walnut
trees
about
the
ranch
house
made
a
darker
mass
in
the
gathering
gloom
her
father
had
gone
to
call
upon
the
dean
the
men
were
at
the
from
which
their
voices
came
low
and
indistinct
within
the
house
the
mother
was
coaxing
little
jack
to
bed
jimmy
and
conny
at
the
farther
end
of
the
porch
were
planning
an
extensive
campaign
against
coyotes
and
investing
the
unearned
profits
of
their
proposed
industry
kitty
thoughts
were
many
miles
away
in
that
bright
and
stirring
life
so
far
from
the
gloomy
stillness
of
her
home
land
where
she
sat
so
alone
what
gay
pleasures
held
her
friends
amid
what
brilliant
scenes
were
they
spending
the
evening
while
she
sat
in
her
dark
and
silent
world
alone
as
her
memory
pictured
the
lights
the
stirring
movement
the
music
the
talk
the
laughter
the
gaiety
the
excitement
the
companionship
of
those
whose
lives
were
so
full
of
interest
her
heart
rebelled
at
the
dull
emptiness
of
her
days
as
she
watched
the
evening
dusk
deepen
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
outlines
of
the
familiar
landscape
fade
and
vanish
in
the
thickening
gloom
she
felt
the
dreary
monotony
of
the
days
and
years
that
were
to
come
blotting
out
of
her
life
all
tone
and
color
and
forms
of
brightness
and
beauty
then
she
saw
slowly
emerging
from
the
shadows
of
the
meadow
below
a
darker
shadow
mysterious
formless
that
seemed
as
it
approached
to
shape
itself
out
of
the
very
darkness
through
which
it
came
until
still
dim
and
indistinct
a
horseman
was
opening
the
meadow
gate
before
the
cowboy
answered
jimmy
boyish
hello
kitty
knew
that
it
was
phil
the
young
woman
first
impulse
was
to
retreat
to
the
safe
seclusion
of
her
own
room
but
even
as
she
arose
to
her
feet
she
knew
how
that
would
hurt
the
man
who
had
always
been
so
good
to
her
and
so
she
went
generously
down
the
walk
to
meet
him
where
he
would
dismount
and
leave
his
horse
did
you
see
father
she
asked
thinking
as
she
spoke
how
little
there
was
for
them
to
talk
about
why
no
what
the
matter
he
returned
quickly
pausing
as
if
ready
to
ride
again
at
her
word
she
laughed
a
little
at
his
manner
there
is
nothing
the
matter
he
just
went
over
to
see
the
dean
that
all
i
must
have
missed
him
crossing
the
meadow
returned
phil
he
always
goes
around
by
the
road
then
when
he
stood
beside
her
he
added
gently
but
there
is
something
the
matter
kitty
what
is
it
lonesome
for
the
bright
lights
that
was
always
phil
way
she
thought
he
seemed
always
to
know
instinctively
her
every
mood
and
wish
perhaps
i
was
a
little
lonely
she
admitted
i
am
glad
that
you
came
then
they
were
at
the
porch
and
her
ambitious
brothers
were
telling
phil
in
detail
their
designs
against
the
peace
of
the
coyote
tribe
and
asking
his
advice
reid
came
to
sit
with
them
and
again
the
talk
followed
around
the
narrow
circle
of
their
lives
until
kitty
felt
that
she
could
bear
no
more
then
reid
more
merciful
than
she
knew
sent
the
boys
to
bed
and
retired
to
her
own
room
and
so
you
are
tired
of
us
all
and
want
to
go
back
mused
phil
breaking
one
of
the
long
silent
periods
that
in
these
days
seemed
so
often
to
fall
upon
them
when
they
found
themselves
alone
that
not
quite
fair
phil
she
returned
gently
you
know
it
not
that
well
then
tired
of
this
his
gesture
indicated
the
sweep
of
the
wide
land
tired
of
what
we
are
and
what
we
do
the
girl
stirred
uneasily
but
did
not
speak
i
do
blame
you
he
continued
as
if
thinking
aloud
it
must
seem
mighty
empty
to
those
who
do
really
know
it
and
do
i
know
it
challenged
kitty
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
was
born
here
that
i
have
lived
here
almost
as
many
years
as
you
but
just
the
same
you
do
know
returned
phil
gently
you
see
dear
you
knew
it
as
a
girl
the
same
as
i
did
when
i
was
a
boy
but
now
well
i
know
it
as
a
man
and
you
as
a
woman
know
something
that
you
think
is
very
different
again
that
long
silence
lay
a
barrier
between
them
then
kitty
made
the
effort
hesitatingly
do
you
love
the
life
so
very
very
much
phil
he
answered
quickly
yes
but
i
could
love
any
life
that
suited
you
no
no
she
returned
hurriedly
that
not
i
mean
phil
why
are
you
so
satisfied
here
there
is
so
little
for
a
man
like
you
so
little
his
voice
told
her
that
her
words
had
stung
i
told
you
that
you
did
not
know
why
everything
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
want
is
here
all
that
life
can
give
anywhere
is
here
i
mean
all
of
life
that
is
worth
having
but
i
suppose
he
finished
lamely
that
it
hard
for
you
to
see
it
that
way
now
it
like
trying
to
make
a
city
man
understand
why
a
fellow
is
never
lonesome
just
because
there
no
crowd
around
i
guess
i
love
this
life
and
am
satisfied
with
it
just
as
the
wild
horses
over
there
at
the
foot
of
old
granite
love
it
and
are
satisfied
but
do
you
feel
sometimes
that
if
you
had
greater
opportunities
do
you
sometimes
wish
that
you
could
live
where
she
paused
at
a
loss
for
words
phil
somehow
always
made
the
things
she
craved
seem
so
trivial
i
know
what
you
mean
he
answered
you
mean
do
the
wild
horses
wish
that
they
could
live
in
a
fine
stable
and
have
a
lot
of
men
to
feed
and
take
care
of
them
and
rig
them
out
with
fancy
harness
and
let
them
prance
down
the
streets
for
the
crowds
to
see
no
horses
have
more
sense
than
that
it
takes
a
human
to
make
that
kind
of
a
fool
of
himself
there
only
one
thing
in
the
world
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
it
and
i
guess
you
know
what
that
is
his
last
words
robbed
his
answer
of
its
sting
and
she
said
gently
you
are
bitter
phil
it
is
not
like
you
he
did
not
answer
did
something
go
wrong
she
persisted
he
turned
suddenly
to
face
her
and
spoke
with
a
passion
unusual
to
him
i
saw
you
at
the
ranch
this
afternoon
as
you
were
riding
away
you
did
not
even
look
toward
the
corral
where
you
knew
i
was
at
work
and
it
seemed
like
all
the
heart
went
clear
out
of
me
oh
kitty
girl
we
bring
back
the
old
days
as
they
were
before
you
went
away
hush
phil
she
said
almost
as
she
would
have
spoken
to
one
of
her
boy
brothers
but
he
went
on
recklessly
no
i
going
to
speak
ever
since
you
came
home
you
have
refused
to
listen
to
me
you
have
put
me
off
made
me
keep
still
i
want
you
to
tell
me
kitty
if
i
were
like
honorable
patches
would
it
make
any
difference
i
do
not
know
patches
she
answered
you
met
him
and
you
know
what
i
mean
would
it
make
any
difference
if
i
were
like
him
why
phil
dear
how
can
i
answer
such
a
question
i
do
not
know
then
it
not
because
i
belong
here
in
this
country
instead
of
back
east
in
some
city
that
has
made
you
change
i
have
changed
i
suppose
because
i
have
become
a
woman
phil
as
you
have
become
a
man
yes
i
have
become
a
man
he
returned
but
i
have
not
changed
except
that
the
boy
love
has
become
a
man
love
would
it
make
any
difference
kitty
if
you
cared
more
for
the
life
here
i
mean
if
you
were
contented
here
if
these
things
that
mean
so
much
to
us
all
satisfied
you
again
she
answered
i
do
not
know
phil
how
can
i
know
will
you
try
kitty
i
mean
try
to
like
your
old
home
as
you
used
to
like
it
oh
phil
i
have
tried
i
do
try
she
cried
but
i
do
think
the
life
that
i
like
or
do
not
like
that
makes
the
difference
i
am
sure
phil
that
if
i
could
she
hesitated
then
went
on
bravely
if
i
could
give
you
the
love
you
want
nothing
else
would
matter
you
said
you
could
like
any
life
that
suited
me
do
you
think
that
i
could
be
satisfied
with
any
life
that
suited
the
man
i
loved
yes
he
said
you
could
and
that
the
answer
what
is
the
answer
she
asked
love
just
love
kitty
any
place
with
love
is
a
good
place
and
without
love
no
life
can
satisfy
i
am
glad
you
said
that
it
was
what
i
wanted
you
to
say
i
know
now
what
i
have
to
do
i
am
like
patches
i
have
found
my
job
there
was
no
bitterness
in
his
voice
now
the
girl
was
deeply
moved
but
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
phil
she
said
why
do
you
see
he
returned
my
job
is
to
win
your
love
to
make
you
love
me
for
myself
for
just
what
i
am
as
a
man
and
not
to
try
to
be
something
or
to
live
some
way
that
i
think
you
would
like
it
the
man
that
you
must
love
and
not
what
he
does
or
where
he
lives
that
it
yes
she
answered
slowly
i
am
sure
that
is
so
it
must
be
so
phil
he
rose
to
his
feet
abruptly
all
right
he
said
almost
roughly
i
go
now
but
do
make
any
mistake
kitty
you
mine
girl
mine
by
laws
that
are
higher
than
the
things
they
taught
you
at
school
and
you
are
going
to
find
it
out
i
am
going
to
win
you
just
as
the
wild
things
out
there
win
their
mates
you
are
going
to
come
to
me
girl
because
you
are
mine
because
you
are
my
mate
and
then
as
she
too
arose
and
they
stood
for
a
silent
moment
facing
each
other
the
woman
felt
his
strength
and
in
her
woman
heart
was
glad
glad
and
proud
though
she
could
not
give
all
that
he
asked
as
she
watched
him
ride
away
into
the
night
and
the
soft
mystery
of
the
darkness
out
of
which
he
had
come
seemed
to
take
his
shadowy
form
again
to
itself
she
wondered
wondered
with
regret
in
the
thought
would
he
perhaps
go
thus
out
of
her
life
would
he
when
phil
turned
his
horse
into
the
meadow
pasture
at
home
the
big
bay
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
trumpeted
his
challenge
a
low
laugh
came
from
near
by
and
in
the
light
of
the
stars
phil
saw
a
man
standing
by
the
pasture
fence
as
he
went
toward
the
shadowy
figure
the
voice
of
patches
followed
the
laugh
i
bet
that
was
stranger
i
know
it
was
answered
phil
what
the
matter
that
you
not
in
bed
oh
i
was
just
listening
to
the
horses
out
there
and
thinking
returned
patches
thinking
about
your
job
asked
phil
quietly
perhaps
admitted
the
other
well
you
have
no
reason
to
worry
you
ride
him
all
right
said
the
cowboy
i
wish
i
could
be
as
sure
the
other
returned
doubt
fully
and
they
both
knew
that
they
were
using
the
big
bay
horse
as
a
symbol
and
i
wish
i
was
as
sure
of
making
good
at
my
job
as
i
am
that
you
will
win
out
with
yours
returned
phil
patches
voice
was
very
kind
as
he
said
reflectively
so
you
have
a
job
too
i
am
glad
for
that
glad
yes
the
tall
man
placed
a
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
as
they
turned
to
walk
toward
the
house
because
phil
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
old
world
is
a
mighty
empty
place
for
the
man
who
has
nothing
to
do
but
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
fellows
who
manage
to
keep
fairly
busy
doing
nothing
just
the
same
do
you
think
replied
phil
with
a
low
laugh
i
said
retorted
patches
with
emphasis
that
right
agreed
phil
a
man
just
naturally
requires
a
job
and
mused
patches
when
it
all
said
and
done
i
suppose
only
one
genuine
man
job
in
the
world
and
i
reckon
that
right
too
returned
the
cowboy
chapter
viii
concerning
brands
a
few
days
after
jim
reid
evening
visit
to
the
dean
two
cowboys
from
the
outfit
on
their
way
to
cherry
creek
stopped
at
the
ranch
for
dinner
the
baldwin
hospitality
led
many
a
passing
rider
thus
aside
from
the
main
valley
road
and
through
the
long
meadow
lane
to
the
table
always
there
was
good
food
for
man
and
horse
with
a
bed
for
those
who
came
late
in
the
day
and
always
there
was
a
hearty
welcome
and
talk
under
the
walnut
trees
with
the
dean
and
in
all
that
broad
land
there
was
scarce
a
cowboy
who
when
riding
the
range
would
not
look
out
for
the
dean
cattle
with
almost
the
same
interest
and
care
that
he
gave
to
the
animals
bearing
the
brand
of
his
own
employer
so
it
was
that
these
riders
from
the
tonto
flats
country
told
the
dean
that
in
looking
over
the
cattle
watering
at
toohey
they
had
seen
several
cases
of
screwworms
we
doped
a
couple
of
the
worst
and
branded
a
calf
for
you
said
shorty
myers
and
his
companion
bert
wilson
added
as
though
apologizing
we
could
stop
any
longer
because
we
got
to
make
it
over
to
before
mornin
much
obliged
boys
returned
the
dean
then
with
his
jest
sure
you
put
the
right
brand
on
that
calf
ai
ridin
for
no
tailholt
mountain
outfit
this
season
retorted
bert
dryly
as
they
all
laughed
at
the
dean
question
and
at
the
cowboy
words
patches
wondering
saw
the
laughing
faces
change
and
looks
of
grim
significance
flash
from
man
to
man
anybody
seen
anything
over
your
way
lately
asked
the
dean
quietly
in
the
moment
of
silence
that
followed
the
visitors
looked
questioningly
from
the
face
of
patches
to
the
dean
and
then
to
phil
phil
smiled
his
endorsement
of
the
stranger
and
shorty
said
we
found
a
couple
of
calves
what
did
seem
to
have
no
mothers
last
week
and
bud
stillwell
says
some
things
look
kind
o
funny
over
in
the
neighborhood
another
significant
silence
followed
to
patches
it
seemed
as
the
brooding
hush
that
often
precedes
a
storm
he
had
not
missed
those
questioning
looks
of
the
visitors
and
had
seen
phil
smiling
endorsement
but
he
could
not
of
course
understand
he
could
only
wonder
and
wait
for
he
felt
intuitively
that
he
must
not
speak
it
was
as
though
these
strong
men
who
had
received
him
so
generously
into
their
lives
put
him
now
outside
their
circle
while
they
considered
business
of
grave
moment
to
themselves
well
boys
said
the
dean
as
if
to
dismiss
the
subject
i
been
in
this
cow
business
a
good
many
years
now
an
i
seen
all
kinds
of
men
come
an
go
but
i
ai
never
seen
the
man
yet
that
could
get
ahead
very
far
without
payin
for
what
he
got
some
time
one
way
or
another
whether
he
so
minded
or
not
a
man
just
naturally
got
to
pay
that
law
is
not
peculiar
to
the
cattle
business
either
is
it
mr
baldwin
the
words
came
from
patches
and
as
they
saw
his
face
it
was
their
turn
to
wonder
the
dean
looked
straight
into
the
dark
eyes
that
were
so
filled
with
painful
memories
and
wistful
desire
sir
i
mean
said
patches
embarrassed
as
though
he
had
spoken
involuntarily
that
what
you
say
applies
to
those
who
live
idly
doing
no
useful
work
whatever
as
well
as
to
those
who
are
dishonest
in
business
of
any
kind
or
who
deliberately
steal
outright
do
you
think
so
the
dean
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
face
of
the
new
man
answered
slowly
i
reckon
that
so
patches
when
you
come
to
think
about
it
it
be
so
one
way
or
another
every
man
that
takes
what
he
earned
has
to
pay
for
it
who
is
he
asked
the
visitors
of
curly
and
bob
as
they
went
for
their
horses
when
the
meal
was
over
the
men
shook
their
heads
just
blew
in
one
day
and
the
dean
hired
him
said
bob
but
he
the
handiest
man
with
his
fists
that
ever
been
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
if
you
do
believe
it
just
you
start
something
added
curly
with
enthusiasm
found
it
out
did
you
laughed
bert
in
something
less
than
a
minute
admitted
curly
funny
name
mused
shorty
bob
grinned
that
what
curly
thought
at
first
and
then
he
took
another
think
huh
yep
agreed
curly
he
sure
carries
the
proper
credentials
to
make
any
name
that
he
wants
to
wear
good
enough
for
me
the
visitors
mounted
their
horses
and
sat
looking
appraisingly
at
the
tall
figure
of
honorable
patches
as
that
gentleman
passed
them
at
a
little
distance
on
his
way
to
the
barn
mebby
you
right
admitted
shorty
but
he
sure
talks
like
a
schoolmarm
do
he
he
sure
ai
no
puncher
commented
bert
no
but
i
gamblin
that
he
goin
to
be
retorted
curly
ignoring
the
reference
to
patches
culture
me
too
agreed
bob
well
we
all
try
him
out
this
fall
rodeo
and
better
not
let
him
drift
far
from
the
home
ranch
for
a
while
laughed
the
visitors
so
long
and
they
were
away
before
breakfast
the
next
morning
phil
said
to
patches
catch
up
snip
and
give
him
a
feed
of
grain
you
ride
with
me
at
patches
look
of
surprise
he
explained
laughingly
i
going
to
give
my
school
a
little
vacation
and
uncle
will
thinks
it
time
you
were
out
of
the
kindergarten
later
as
they
were
crossing
the
big
pasture
toward
the
country
that
lies
to
the
south
the
foreman
volunteered
the
further
information
that
for
the
next
few
weeks
they
would
ride
the
range
may
i
ask
what
for
said
patches
encouraged
by
the
cowboy
manner
it
was
one
of
the
man
peculiarities
that
he
rarely
entered
into
the
talk
of
his
new
friends
when
their
work
was
the
topic
of
conversation
and
he
never
asked
questions
except
when
alone
with
phil
or
the
dean
and
then
only
when
led
on
by
them
it
was
not
that
he
sought
to
hide
his
ignorance
for
he
made
no
pretenses
whatever
but
his
reticence
seemed
rather
the
result
of
a
curious
feeling
of
shame
that
he
had
so
little
in
common
with
these
men
whose
lives
were
so
filled
with
useful
labor
and
this
if
he
had
known
was
one
of
the
things
that
made
them
like
him
men
who
live
in
such
close
daily
touch
with
the
primitive
realities
of
life
and
who
thereby
acquire
a
simple
directness
with
a
certain
native
modesty
have
no
place
in
their
hearts
for
to
use
their
own
picturesque
vernacular
a
phil
tactfully
did
not
even
smile
at
the
question
but
answered
in
a
tone
to
look
out
for
brand
a
calf
here
and
there
keep
the
water
holes
open
and
look
out
for
the
stock
generally
and
you
mean
questioned
patches
doubtfully
that
am
to
ride
with
you
sure
you
see
uncle
will
thinks
you
are
too
good
a
man
to
waste
on
the
odd
jobs
around
the
place
and
so
i
going
to
get
you
in
shape
for
the
rodeo
this
fall
the
effect
of
his
words
was
peculiar
a
deep
red
colored
patches
face
and
his
eyes
shone
with
a
glad
light
as
he
faced
his
companion
and
you
what
do
you
think
about
it
phil
he
demanded
the
cowboy
laughed
at
the
man
eagerness
me
oh
i
think
just
as
i
have
thought
all
the
time
ever
since
you
asked
for
a
job
that
day
in
the
corral
patches
drew
a
long
breath
and
sitting
very
straight
in
the
saddle
looked
away
toward
granite
mountain
while
phil
watching
him
curiously
felt
something
like
kindly
pity
in
his
heart
for
this
man
who
seemed
to
hunger
so
for
a
man
work
and
a
place
among
men
just
outside
the
deep
wash
gate
of
the
big
pasture
a
few
cattle
were
grazing
in
the
open
flat
as
the
men
rode
toward
them
phil
took
down
his
riata
while
patches
watched
him
questioningly
we
may
as
well
begin
right
here
said
the
cowboy
do
you
see
anything
peculiar
about
anything
in
that
bunch
patches
studied
the
cattle
in
vain
what
about
that
calf
yonder
suggested
phil
leisurely
opening
the
loop
of
his
rope
i
mean
that
youngster
with
the
white
face
still
patches
hesitated
phil
helped
him
again
look
at
his
ears
they
not
marked
exclaimed
patches
and
what
should
they
be
marked
asked
the
teacher
right
and
a
split
left
if
he
belongs
to
the
returned
the
pupil
proudly
and
in
the
same
breath
he
exclaimed
he
is
not
branded
either
phil
smiled
approval
that
right
and
we
just
fix
him
now
before
somebody
else
beats
us
to
him
he
moved
his
horse
slowly
toward
the
cattle
as
he
spoke
but
exclaimed
patches
how
do
you
know
that
he
belongs
to
the
he
does
returned
phil
laughing
he
belongs
to
me
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
tell
i
know
because
i
know
the
stock
phil
explained
and
because
i
happen
to
remember
that
particular
calf
in
the
rodeo
last
spring
he
got
away
from
us
with
his
mother
in
the
cedars
and
brush
over
near
the
head
of
mint
that
one
of
the
things
that
you
have
to
learn
in
this
business
you
see
but
to
be
sure
we
right
you
watch
him
a
minute
and
you
see
him
go
to
a
cow
the
is
my
iron
you
know
i
have
a
few
head
running
with
uncle
will
even
as
he
spoke
the
calf
frightened
at
their
closer
approach
ran
to
a
cow
that
was
branded
as
phil
had
said
and
the
cow
with
unmistakable
maternal
interest
in
her
offspring
proved
the
ownership
of
the
calf
you
see
said
phil
we
get
that
fellow
now
because
before
the
next
rodeo
he
be
big
enough
to
leave
his
mother
and
then
if
he
is
branded
he
be
a
maverick
and
will
belong
to
anybody
that
puts
an
iron
on
him
but
could
someone
brand
him
now
with
their
brand
and
drive
him
away
from
his
mother
asked
patches
such
things
have
been
known
to
happen
and
that
not
a
thousand
miles
from
here
either
returned
phil
dryly
but
really
you
know
patches
it
is
done
among
the
best
people
patches
laughed
aloud
at
his
companion
attempt
at
a
simpering
affectation
then
he
watched
with
admiration
while
the
cowboy
sent
his
horse
after
the
calf
and
too
quickly
for
an
inexperienced
eye
to
see
just
how
it
was
done
the
deft
riata
stretched
the
animal
by
the
heels
with
a
short
hogging
rope
which
he
carried
looped
through
a
hole
cut
in
the
edge
of
his
chaps
near
the
belt
phil
tied
the
feet
of
his
victim
before
the
animal
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
the
fall
and
then
with
patches
helping
proceeded
to
build
a
small
fire
of
dry
grass
and
leaves
and
sticks
from
a
bush
from
his
saddle
phil
took
a
small
iron
rod
flattened
at
one
end
and
only
long
enough
to
permit
its
being
held
in
the
gloved
hand
when
the
flattened
end
was
hot
a
running
iron
he
called
it
and
explained
to
his
interested
pupil
as
he
thrust
it
into
the
fire
how
some
of
the
boys
used
an
iron
ring
for
range
branding
and
is
there
no
way
to
change
or
erase
a
brand
asked
patches
while
the
iron
was
heating
sure
there
is
replied
phil
and
sitting
on
his
heels
cowboy
fashion
he
marked
on
the
ground
with
a
stick
look
this
is
the
brand
illustration
and
this
illustration
the
happens
to
be
nick
cambert
iron
over
at
tailholt
mountain
now
ca
you
see
how
supposing
i
were
nick
and
this
calf
were
branded
with
the
i
could
work
the
iron
over
into
my
brand
patches
nodded
but
is
there
no
way
to
detect
such
a
fraud
it
a
mighty
hard
thing
to
prove
that
an
iron
has
bees
worked
over
phil
answered
slowly
about
the
only
sure
way
is
to
catch
the
thief
in
the
act
but
there
are
the
earmarks
said
patches
a
few
moments
later
when
phil
had
released
the
branded
and
marked
calf
the
earmarks
and
the
brand
would
agree
they
would
if
i
were
nick
said
the
cowboy
then
he
added
quickly
as
if
regretting
his
remark
our
earmark
is
an
right
and
a
split
left
you
said
well
the
earmark
is
a
crop
and
an
right
and
a
left
with
the
point
of
his
iron
now
he
again
marked
in
the
dirt
here
your
illustration
and
here
your
illustration
and
if
a
calf
branded
with
a
tailholt
iron
were
to
be
found
following
a
cow
then
what
came
patches
very
natural
question
then
returned
the
foreman
of
the
grimly
there
would
be
a
mighty
good
chance
for
trouble
but
it
seems
to
me
said
patches
as
they
rode
on
that
it
would
be
easily
possible
for
a
man
to
brand
another
man
calf
by
mistake
a
man
always
makes
a
mistake
when
he
puts
his
iron
on
another
property
returned
the
cowboy
shortly
but
might
it
not
be
done
innocently
just
the
same
persisted
patches
yes
it
might
admitted
phil
well
then
what
would
you
do
if
you
found
a
calf
that
you
knew
belonged
to
the
dean
branded
with
some
other
man
brand
i
mean
how
would
you
proceed
oh
i
see
what
you
are
driving
at
said
phil
in
quite
a
different
tone
if
you
ever
run
on
to
a
case
the
first
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
be
dead
sure
that
the
misbranded
calf
belongs
to
one
of
our
cows
then
if
you
are
right
and
it
not
too
far
drive
the
cow
and
calf
into
the
nearest
corral
and
report
it
if
you
ca
get
them
to
a
corral
without
too
much
trouble
just
put
the
on
the
calf
ribs
when
he
shows
up
in
the
next
rodeo
with
the
right
brand
on
his
ribs
and
some
other
brand
where
the
right
brand
ought
to
be
you
take
pains
to
remember
his
natural
markings
of
course
you
will
explain
the
circumstances
and
the
owner
of
the
iron
that
was
put
on
him
by
mistake
will
be
asked
to
vent
his
brand
a
brand
is
vented
by
putting
the
same
brand
on
the
animal
shoulder
look
there
one
now
he
pointed
to
an
animal
a
short
distance
away
see
that
steer
is
branded
on
hip
and
shoulder
and
on
his
ribs
well
when
he
was
a
yearling
he
belonged
to
the
outfit
we
picked
him
up
in
the
rodeo
away
over
toward
mud
tanks
he
was
running
with
our
stock
and
stillwell
did
want
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
taking
him
home
about
thirty
miles
it
is
so
he
sold
him
to
uncle
will
and
vented
his
brand
as
you
see
i
see
said
patches
but
that
different
from
finding
a
calf
misbranded
sure
there
was
no
question
of
ownership
there
agreed
phil
but
in
the
case
of
the
calf
the
cowboy
pupil
persisted
if
it
had
left
its
mother
when
the
man
owning
the
iron
was
asked
to
vent
it
there
would
be
no
way
of
proving
the
real
ownership
nothing
but
the
word
of
the
man
who
found
the
calf
with
its
mother
and
perhaps
the
knowledge
of
the
men
who
knew
the
stock
what
i
am
getting
at
smiled
patches
is
this
it
would
come
down
at
last
to
a
question
of
men
would
it
that
where
most
things
come
to
in
the
end
in
this
country
patches
but
you
right
with
owners
like
uncle
will
and
jim
reid
and
stillwell
and
dozens
of
others
and
with
cowboys
like
curly
and
bob
and
bert
and
there
would
be
no
trouble
at
all
about
the
matter
but
with
others
suggested
patches
well
said
phil
slowly
there
are
men
in
this
country
who
if
they
refused
to
vent
a
brand
under
such
circumstances
would
be
seeing
trouble
and
mighty
quick
too
there
another
thing
that
we
got
to
watch
out
for
just
now
phil
continued
a
few
minutes
later
and
that
is
suppose
he
explained
that
i
want
to
build
up
my
bunch
of
and
that
i
am
not
too
particular
about
how
i
do
it
well
i
run
on
to
an
unbranded
calf
that
looks
good
to
me
but
i
do
dare
put
my
iron
on
him
because
he
too
young
to
leave
his
mother
if
i
let
him
go
until
he
is
older
some
of
jim
reid
riders
will
brand
him
and
you
see
i
never
could
work
over
the
iron
into
my
so
i
earmark
the
calf
with
the
owner
marks
and
do
brand
him
at
all
then
he
a
sleeper
if
the
boys
see
him
they
notice
that
he
earmarked
all
right
and
very
likely
they
take
it
for
granted
that
he
branded
or
perhaps
let
him
go
anyway
before
the
next
rodeo
i
run
on
to
my
sleeper
again
and
he
big
enough
now
to
take
away
from
the
cow
so
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
change
the
earmarks
and
brand
him
with
my
iron
of
course
i
would
get
all
my
sleepers
but
the
percentage
would
be
in
my
favor
if
too
many
sleepers
show
up
in
the
rodeo
though
folks
would
get
mighty
suspicious
that
someone
was
too
handy
with
his
knife
we
got
a
lot
of
sleepers
in
the
last
rodeo
he
concluded
quietly
and
patches
remembering
what
little
billy
had
said
about
nick
cambert
and
yavapai
joe
and
with
the
talk
of
the
visiting
cowboys
still
fresh
in
his
mind
realized
that
he
was
making
progress
in
his
education
riding
leisurely
and
turning
frequently
aside
for
a
nearer
view
of
the
cattle
they
sighted
here
and
there
they
reached
toohey
a
little
before
noon
here
in
a
rocky
hollow
of
the
hills
a
small
stream
wells
from
under
the
granite
walls
only
to
lose
itself
a
few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
sands
and
gravel
of
the
wash
but
short
as
its
run
in
the
daylight
is
the
water
never
fails
and
many
cattle
come
from
the
open
range
that
lies
on
every
side
to
drink
and
in
summer
time
to
spend
the
heat
of
the
day
standing
in
the
cool
wet
sands
or
lying
in
the
shade
of
the
giant
sycamores
that
line
the
bank
opposite
the
bluff
there
are
corrals
and
a
rude
under
the
branches
of
an
old
walnut
tree
and
the
ground
of
the
flat
open
space
a
little
back
from
the
water
is
beaten
bare
and
hard
by
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
cattle
that
have
at
many
a
past
been
gathered
there
the
two
men
found
as
the
riders
had
said
several
animals
suffering
from
those
pests
of
the
arizona
ranges
the
screwworms
as
phil
explained
to
patches
while
they
watered
their
horses
the
screwworm
is
the
larva
of
a
blowfly
bred
in
sores
on
living
animals
the
unhealed
wounds
of
the
branding
iron
made
the
calves
by
far
the
most
numerous
among
the
sufferers
and
were
the
afflicted
animals
not
treated
the
loss
during
the
season
would
amount
to
considerable
look
here
patches
said
the
cowboy
as
his
practiced
eyes
noted
the
number
needing
attention
i
tell
you
what
we
do
we
just
run
this
hospital
bunch
into
the
corral
and
you
can
limber
up
that
riata
of
yours
and
so
patches
learned
not
only
the
unpleasant
work
of
cleaning
the
sores
with
chloroform
but
received
his
first
lesson
in
the
use
of
the
cowboy
indispensable
tool
the
riata
what
next
asked
patches
as
the
last
calf
escaped
through
the
gate
which
he
had
just
opened
and
ran
to
find
the
waiting
and
anxious
mother
phil
looked
at
his
companion
and
laughed
honorable
patches
showed
the
effect
of
his
strenuous
and
bungling
efforts
to
learn
the
rudiments
of
the
apparently
simple
trick
of
roping
a
calf
his
face
was
streaked
with
sweat
and
dust
his
hair
disheveled
and
his
clothing
soiled
and
stained
but
his
eyes
were
bright
and
his
bearing
eager
and
ready
what
the
matter
he
demanded
grinning
happily
at
his
teacher
what
fool
thing
have
i
done
now
you
doing
fine
phil
returned
i
was
only
thinking
that
you
look
much
like
the
man
i
met
up
on
the
divide
that
evening
i
do
feel
much
like
him
either
as
far
as
that
goes
returned
patches
phil
glanced
up
at
the
sun
what
do
you
say
to
dinner
it
must
be
about
that
time
dinner
sure
i
brought
some
jerky
there
on
my
saddle
and
some
coffee
there
ought
to
be
an
old
pot
in
the
shack
yonder
some
of
the
boys
bother
but
i
never
like
to
miss
a
feed
unless
it
necessary
he
did
not
explain
that
the
dinner
was
really
a
thoughtful
concession
to
his
companion
ugh
ejaculated
patches
with
a
shrug
of
disgust
the
work
they
had
been
doing
still
fresh
in
his
mind
i
could
eat
a
bite
you
think
that
now
retorted
phil
but
you
just
go
down
to
the
creek
drink
all
you
can
hold
wash
up
and
see
how
quick
you
change
your
mind
when
you
smell
the
coffee
and
thus
patches
received
yet
another
lesson
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
forgetting
promptly
the
most
disagreeable
features
of
his
work
an
art
very
necessary
to
those
who
aspire
to
master
real
work
of
any
sort
whatever
when
they
had
finished
their
simple
meal
and
lay
stretched
full
length
beneath
the
overhanging
limbs
of
the
tree
that
had
witnessed
so
many
stirring
scenes
and
listened
to
so
many
tales
of
ranch
and
range
they
talked
of
things
other
than
their
work
in
low
tones
as
men
who
feel
a
mystic
and
bond
of
fellowship
with
eyes
looking
out
into
the
untamed
world
that
lay
before
them
they
spoke
of
life
of
its
mystery
and
meaning
and
phil
usually
so
silent
when
any
conversation
touched
himself
and
so
timid
always
in
expressing
his
own
self
thoughts
was
strangely
moved
to
permit
this
man
to
look
upon
the
carefully
hidden
and
deeper
things
of
his
life
but
upon
his
cherished
dream
upon
his
great
ambition
he
kept
the
door
fast
closed
the
time
for
that
revelation
of
himself
was
not
yet
by
the
way
phil
said
patches
when
at
last
his
companion
signified
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
where
were
you
educated
i
do
think
that
i
have
heard
you
say
i
have
no
education
returned
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
that
to
patches
sounded
a
bitter
note
i
just
a
common
all
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
the
other
but
i
thought
from
the
books
you
mentioned
oh
the
books
why
you
see
some
four
years
ago
a
real
book
man
came
out
to
this
country
for
his
health
and
brought
his
disease
along
with
him
his
disease
questioned
patches
phil
smiled
his
books
i
mean
they
killed
him
and
i
fell
heir
to
his
trouble
he
was
a
good
fellow
all
right
we
all
liked
him
might
have
been
a
man
if
he
had
been
so
much
of
a
scholar
i
was
curious
at
first
just
to
see
what
it
was
that
had
got
such
a
grip
on
him
and
then
i
got
interested
myself
about
that
time
too
there
was
a
reason
why
i
thought
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
me
so
i
sent
for
more
and
have
made
a
fairly
good
job
of
it
in
the
past
three
years
i
do
think
that
there
any
danger
though
of
the
habit
getting
the
grip
on
me
that
it
had
on
him
he
reflected
with
a
whimsical
grin
it
was
our
book
friend
who
first
called
uncle
will
the
dean
the
title
certainly
fits
him
well
remarked
patches
i
do
wonder
that
it
stuck
i
suppose
you
received
yours
for
your
riding
mine
horse
phil
i
mean
smiled
the
other
phil
laughed
have
you
heard
that
yarn
yet
i
reckon
i
may
as
well
tell
you
no
wait
he
exclaimed
eagerly
we
have
lots
of
time
ride
south
a
little
way
and
perhaps
i
can
show
you
as
they
rode
away
up
the
creek
patches
wondered
much
at
his
words
and
at
his
manner
but
the
cowboy
shook
his
head
at
every
question
answering
simply
wait
soon
they
had
left
the
creek
bed
passing
through
a
rock
gateway
at
the
beginning
of
the
little
stream
and
were
riding
up
a
long
gently
sloping
hollow
between
two
low
but
rugged
ridges
the
crest
of
the
rocky
wall
on
their
left
was
somewhat
higher
than
the
ridge
on
their
right
but
as
the
floor
of
the
long
narrow
hollow
ascended
the
sides
of
the
little
valley
became
correspondingly
lower
patches
noticed
that
his
companion
was
now
keenly
alert
and
watchful
he
sat
his
horse
easily
but
there
was
a
certain
air
of
readiness
in
his
poise
as
though
he
anticipated
sudden
action
while
his
eyes
searched
the
mountain
sides
with
eager
expectancy
they
had
nearly
reached
the
upper
end
of
the
long
slope
when
phil
abruptly
reined
his
horse
to
the
left
and
rode
straight
up
that
rugged
mountain
wall
to
patches
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
horse
could
climb
such
a
place
but
he
said
nothing
and
wisely
gave
snip
his
head
they
were
nearly
at
the
top
so
near
in
fact
that
phil
could
see
over
the
narrow
crest
when
the
cowboy
suddenly
checked
his
horse
and
slipped
from
the
saddle
with
a
gesture
he
bade
his
companion
follow
his
example
and
in
a
moment
patches
stood
beside
him
leaving
their
horses
they
crept
the
few
remaining
feet
to
the
summit
crouching
low
then
lying
prone
they
worked
their
way
to
the
top
of
a
huge
rounded
rock
from
which
they
could
look
over
and
down
upon
the
country
that
lies
beyond
patches
uttered
a
low
exclamation
but
phil
instant
grip
on
his
arm
checked
further
speech
from
where
they
lay
they
looked
down
upon
a
great
mountain
basin
of
gently
rolling
native
grass
land
from
the
foot
of
that
rocky
ridge
the
beautiful
pasture
stretches
away
several
miles
to
the
bold
gray
cliffs
and
mighty
towering
battlements
of
granite
mountain
on
the
south
a
range
of
dark
hills
and
to
the
north
a
series
of
sharp
peaks
form
the
natural
boundaries
do
you
see
them
whispered
phil
patches
looked
at
him
inquiringly
the
stranger
interest
in
that
wonderful
scene
had
led
him
to
overlook
that
which
held
his
attention
there
whispered
phil
impatiently
on
the
side
of
that
hill
there
they
not
more
than
four
hundred
yards
away
and
working
toward
us
do
you
mean
those
horses
whispered
patches
amazed
at
his
manner
phil
nodded
do
they
belong
to
the
asked
patches
still
mystified
the
phil
chuckled
then
with
a
note
of
genuine
reverence
in
his
voice
he
added
softly
they
belong
to
god
mr
honorable
patches
then
patches
understood
wild
horses
he
ejaculated
softly
there
are
few
men
i
think
who
can
look
without
admiration
upon
a
beautifully
formed
noble
spirited
horse
the
glorious
pride
and
strength
and
courage
of
these
most
kingly
of
god
creatures
even
when
they
are
in
harness
and
subject
to
their
often
inferior
masters
compel
respect
and
a
degree
of
appreciation
but
seen
as
they
roam
free
in
those
pastures
that
since
the
creation
have
never
been
marred
by
plow
or
fence
pastures
that
are
theirs
by
divine
right
and
the
sunny
slopes
and
shady
groves
and
rocky
nooks
of
which
constitute
their
kingdom
where
in
their
lordly
strength
they
are
subject
only
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
being
and
unmutilated
by
human
cruelty
rule
by
the
power
and
authority
of
nature
laws
they
stir
the
blood
of
the
coldest
heart
to
a
quicker
flow
and
thrill
the
mind
of
the
dullest
with
admiring
awe
there
in
that
bunch
whispered
phil
do
you
see
that
big
black
stallion
on
guard
the
one
that
throws
up
his
head
every
minute
or
two
for
a
look
around
patches
nodded
there
was
no
mistaking
the
watchful
leader
of
the
band
he
the
chap
that
gave
me
my
title
as
you
call
it
chuckled
phil
come
on
now
and
we
see
them
in
action
then
i
tell
you
about
it
he
slipped
from
the
rock
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
saddle
horses
riding
along
the
ridge
just
under
the
crest
they
soon
reached
the
point
where
the
chain
of
low
peaks
merges
into
the
hills
that
form
the
southern
boundary
of
the
basin
and
so
came
suddenly
into
full
view
of
the
wild
horses
that
were
feeding
on
the
slopes
a
little
below
as
the
two
horsemen
appeared
the
leader
of
the
band
threw
up
his
head
with
a
warning
call
to
his
fellows
phil
reined
in
his
horse
and
motioned
for
patches
to
do
the
same
for
several
minutes
the
black
stallion
held
his
place
as
motionless
as
the
very
rocks
of
the
mountain
side
gazing
straight
at
the
mounted
men
as
though
challenging
their
right
to
cross
the
boundary
of
his
kingdom
while
his
retainers
stood
as
still
waiting
his
leadership
with
his
long
black
mane
and
tail
rippling
and
waving
in
the
breeze
that
swept
down
from
blair
pass
and
across
the
basin
with
his
coat
glistening
in
the
sunlight
with
the
sheen
of
richest
satin
where
the
swelling
muscles
curved
and
rounded
from
shadow
to
high
light
and
with
his
poise
of
perfect
strength
and
freedom
he
looked
as
indeed
he
was
a
prince
of
his
kind
a
lord
of
the
untamed
life
that
homes
in
those
fields
patches
glanced
at
his
companion
as
if
to
speak
but
struck
by
the
expression
on
the
cowboy
face
remained
silent
phil
was
leaning
a
little
forward
in
his
saddle
his
body
as
perfect
in
its
poise
of
alert
and
graceful
strength
as
the
body
of
the
wild
horse
at
which
he
was
gazing
with
such
fixed
interest
the
clear
deeply
tanned
skin
of
his
cheeks
glowed
warmly
with
the
red
of
his
clean
rich
blood
his
eyes
shone
with
suppressed
excitement
his
lips
slightly
parted
curved
in
a
smile
of
appreciation
love
and
reverence
for
the
unspoiled
beauty
of
the
wild
creature
that
he
himself
in
so
many
ways
unconsciously
resembled
and
patches
bred
and
schooled
in
a
world
so
far
from
this
world
of
primitive
things
looking
from
phil
to
the
wild
horse
and
back
again
from
the
stallion
to
the
man
felt
the
spirit
and
the
power
that
made
them
kin
felt
it
with
a
to
him
strange
new
feeling
of
reverence
as
though
in
the
perfect
unspoiled
of
man
and
horse
he
came
in
closer
touch
with
the
divine
than
he
had
ever
known
before
then
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
object
of
his
almost
worship
phil
said
now
watch
him
patches
watch
him
as
he
spoke
he
moved
slowly
toward
the
band
while
patches
rode
close
by
his
side
at
their
movement
the
wild
stallion
called
another
warning
to
his
followers
and
went
a
few
graceful
paces
toward
the
slowly
approaching
men
and
then
as
they
continued
their
slow
advance
he
wheeled
with
the
smooth
grace
of
a
swallow
and
with
a
movement
so
light
and
free
that
he
seemed
rather
to
skim
over
the
surface
of
the
ground
than
to
tread
upon
it
circled
here
and
there
about
his
band
assembling
them
in
closer
order
flying
with
ears
flat
and
teeth
bared
and
mane
and
tail
tossing
in
lordly
fury
at
the
laggards
driving
them
before
him
but
keeping
always
between
his
charges
and
the
danger
until
they
were
at
what
he
evidently
judged
to
be
for
their
inferior
strength
a
distance
of
safety
then
again
he
halted
his
company
and
moving
alone
a
short
way
toward
the
horsemen
stood
motionless
watching
their
slow
approach
again
phil
checked
his
horse
god
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
what
a
sight
oh
you
beauty
you
beauty
but
patches
was
moved
less
by
the
royal
beauty
of
the
wild
stallion
than
by
the
passionate
reverence
that
vibrated
in
his
companion
voice
again
the
two
horsemen
moved
forward
and
again
the
stallion
drove
his
band
to
a
safe
distance
and
stood
waiting
between
them
and
their
enemies
then
the
cowboy
laughed
aloud
a
hearty
laugh
of
clean
enjoyment
all
right
old
fellow
i
just
give
you
a
whirl
for
luck
he
said
aloud
to
the
wild
horse
apparently
forgetting
his
human
companion
and
patches
saw
him
shorten
his
reins
and
rise
a
little
in
his
stirrups
while
his
horse
as
though
understanding
gathered
himself
for
a
spring
in
a
flash
patches
was
alone
watching
as
phil
riding
with
every
ounce
of
strength
that
his
mount
could
command
dashed
straight
toward
the
band
for
a
moment
the
black
stallion
stood
watching
the
now
rapidly
approaching
rider
then
wheeling
he
started
his
band
driving
them
imperiously
now
to
their
utmost
speed
and
then
as
though
he
understood
this
new
maneuver
of
the
cowboy
he
swept
past
his
running
companions
with
the
clean
easy
flight
of
an
arrow
and
taking
his
place
at
the
head
of
his
charges
led
them
away
toward
granite
mountain
phil
stopped
and
patches
could
see
him
watching
as
the
wild
horses
with
streaming
manes
and
tails
following
their
leader
who
seemed
to
run
with
less
than
half
his
strength
swept
away
across
the
rolling
hillsides
growing
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
until
as
dark
swiftly
moving
dots
they
vanished
over
the
sky
line
was
that
great
cried
phil
when
he
had
loped
back
to
his
companion
did
you
see
him
go
by
the
bunch
like
they
were
standing
still
there
did
seem
to
be
much
show
for
you
to
catch
him
said
patches
catch
him
exclaimed
phil
did
you
think
i
was
trying
to
catch
him
i
just
wanted
to
see
him
go
the
horse
does
live
that
could
put
a
man
within
roping
distance
of
any
one
in
that
bunch
on
a
straightaway
run
and
the
black
can
run
circles
around
the
whole
outfit
i
had
him
once
though
you
caught
that
black
exclaimed
patches
incredulously
phil
grinned
i
sure
had
him
for
a
little
while
but
what
is
he
doing
out
here
running
loose
then
demanded
the
other
got
away
did
he
got
away
nothing
fact
is
he
belongs
to
me
right
now
in
a
way
and
i
would
swap
him
for
any
string
of
that
i
ever
saw
then
as
they
rode
toward
the
home
ranch
phil
told
the
story
that
is
known
throughout
all
that
country
it
was
when
the
black
was
a
yearling
he
said
i
had
my
eye
on
him
all
the
year
and
so
had
some
of
the
other
boys
who
had
sighted
the
band
for
you
could
see
even
when
he
was
a
colt
what
he
was
going
to
be
the
wild
horses
were
getting
rather
too
numerous
that
season
and
we
planned
a
chase
to
thin
them
out
a
little
as
we
do
every
two
or
three
years
of
course
everybody
was
after
the
black
and
one
day
along
toward
the
end
of
the
chase
when
the
different
bands
had
been
broken
up
and
scattered
pretty
much
i
ran
onto
him
i
was
trailing
an
old
gray
up
that
draw
the
way
we
went
you
know
and
all
at
once
i
met
him
as
he
was
coming
over
the
top
of
the
hill
right
where
you
and
i
rode
onto
him
it
was
all
so
sudden
that
for
a
minute
he
was
rattled
as
bad
as
i
was
and
believe
me
i
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
i
managed
to
come
to
first
though
and
hung
my
rope
on
him
before
he
could
get
started
i
do
know
to
this
day
where
the
old
gray
that
i
was
after
went
well
sir
he
fought
like
a
devil
and
for
a
spell
we
had
it
around
and
around
until
i
was
dead
sure
whether
i
had
him
or
he
had
me
but
he
was
only
a
yearling
then
you
see
and
i
finally
got
him
down
phil
paused
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
patches
waited
silently
do
you
know
said
the
cowboy
at
last
hesitatingly
i
ca
explain
it
and
i
do
talk
about
it
much
for
it
was
the
strangest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
but
when
i
looked
into
that
black
stallion
eyes
and
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
i
never
felt
so
sorry
for
anything
in
my
life
i
was
sort
of
ashamed
like
like
well
like
been
caught
holding
up
a
church
you
know
or
something
like
that
we
were
all
alone
up
there
just
him
and
me
and
while
i
was
getting
my
wind
and
we
were
sizing
each
other
up
and
i
was
feeling
that
way
i
got
to
thinking
what
it
all
meant
to
him
to
be
broken
and
educated
and
well
civilized
you
know
and
i
thought
what
a
horse
he
would
be
if
he
was
left
alone
to
live
as
god
made
him
and
so
well
he
paused
again
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
you
let
him
go
cried
patches
it
god
truth
patches
i
could
do
anything
else
i
just
could
one
of
the
boys
came
up
just
in
time
to
catch
me
turning
him
loose
and
of
course
the
whole
outfit
just
naturally
raised
hell
about
it
you
see
in
a
chase
like
that
we
always
bunch
all
we
get
and
sell
them
off
to
the
highest
bidder
and
every
man
in
the
outfit
shares
alike
the
boys
figured
that
the
black
was
worth
more
than
any
five
others
that
were
caught
and
so
you
could
blame
them
for
feeling
sore
but
i
fixed
it
with
them
by
turning
all
my
share
into
the
pot
so
they
could
kick
that
you
see
makes
the
black
belong
to
me
in
a
way
and
it
pretty
generally
understood
that
i
propose
to
take
care
of
him
there
was
a
fellow
riding
in
the
rodeo
last
fall
that
took
a
shot
at
him
one
day
and
well
he
left
the
country
right
after
it
happened
and
has
been
seen
around
here
since
the
cowboy
grinned
as
his
companion
laugh
rang
out
do
you
know
phil
continued
in
a
low
tone
a
few
minutes
later
i
believe
that
horse
knows
me
yet
whenever
i
am
over
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
always
have
a
look
at
him
if
he
happens
to
be
around
and
we
visit
a
little
as
we
did
i
got
a
funny
notion
that
he
likes
it
as
much
as
i
do
and
i
ca
tell
how
it
is
but
it
sort
of
makes
me
feel
good
all
over
just
to
see
him
i
reckon
you
think
i
some
fool
he
finished
with
another
short
laugh
of
embarrassment
but
that
the
way
i
feel
and
that
why
they
call
me
horse
phil
for
a
little
they
rode
in
silence
then
patches
spoke
gravely
i
know
how
to
tell
you
what
i
think
phil
but
i
understand
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
envy
you
and
the
cowboy
looking
at
his
companion
saw
in
the
man
eyes
something
that
reminded
him
of
that
which
he
had
seen
in
the
wild
horse
eyes
that
day
when
he
had
set
him
free
had
patches
too
at
some
time
in
those
days
that
were
gone
been
caught
by
the
riata
of
circumstance
or
environment
and
in
some
degree
robbed
of
his
phil
smiled
at
the
fancy
but
smiling
felt
its
truth
and
with
genuine
sympathy
felt
this
also
to
be
true
that
the
man
might
yet
by
the
strength
that
was
deepest
within
him
regain
that
which
he
had
lost
and
so
that
day
as
the
man
from
the
ranges
and
the
man
from
the
cities
rode
together
the
feeling
of
kinship
that
each
had
instinctively
recognized
at
their
first
meeting
on
the
divide
was
strengthened
they
knew
that
a
mutual
understanding
which
could
not
have
been
put
into
words
of
any
tongue
or
land
was
drawing
them
closer
together
a
few
days
later
the
incident
occurred
that
fixed
their
friendship
as
they
thought
for
all
time
to
come
chapter
ix
the
tailholt
mountain
outfit
phil
and
patches
were
riding
that
day
in
the
country
about
old
camp
early
in
the
afternoon
they
heard
the
persistent
bawling
of
a
calf
and
upon
riding
toward
the
sound
found
the
animal
deep
in
the
cedar
timber
which
in
that
section
thickly
covers
the
ridges
the
calf
was
freshly
branded
with
the
tailholt
iron
it
was
done
phil
said
the
day
before
probably
in
the
late
afternoon
the
youngster
was
calling
for
his
mother
it
strange
she
is
not
around
somewhere
said
patches
it
would
be
more
strange
if
she
was
retorted
the
cowboy
shortly
and
he
looked
from
the
calf
to
the
distant
tailholt
mountain
as
though
he
were
considering
some
problem
which
he
did
not
for
some
reason
care
to
share
with
his
companion
there
not
much
use
to
look
for
her
he
added
with
grim
disappointment
that
always
the
way
if
we
had
ridden
this
range
yesterday
instead
of
away
over
there
in
the
mint
wash
country
i
am
always
about
a
day
behind
there
was
something
in
the
manner
and
in
the
quiet
speech
of
the
usually
foreman
that
made
his
companion
hesitate
to
ask
questions
or
to
offer
comment
with
the
freedom
that
he
had
learned
to
feel
that
first
day
of
their
riding
together
during
the
hours
that
followed
phil
said
very
little
and
when
he
did
speak
his
words
were
brief
and
often
curt
while
to
patches
he
seemed
to
study
the
country
over
which
they
rode
with
unusual
care
when
they
had
eaten
their
rather
gloomy
lunch
he
was
in
the
saddle
again
almost
before
patches
had
finished
with
seemingly
no
inclination
for
their
usual
talk
the
afternoon
was
nearly
gone
and
they
were
making
their
way
homeward
when
they
saw
a
bull
that
had
evidently
been
hurt
in
a
fight
the
animal
was
one
of
the
dean
herefords
and
the
wound
needed
attention
we
got
to
dope
that
said
phil
or
the
screwworms
will
be
working
in
it
sure
he
was
taking
down
his
riata
and
watching
the
bull
who
was
rumbling
a
sullen
challenge
as
he
spoke
can
i
help
asked
patches
anxiously
as
he
viewed
the
powerful
beast
for
this
was
the
first
animal
needing
attention
that
he
had
seen
in
his
few
days
experience
no
returned
phil
just
keep
in
the
clear
that
all
this
chap
is
no
calf
and
he
sore
over
his
scrap
he
on
the
prod
right
now
it
all
happened
in
a
few
seconds
the
cowboy
horse
understanding
from
long
experience
that
this
threatening
mark
for
his
master
riata
was
in
no
gentle
frame
of
mind
fretted
uneasily
as
though
dreading
his
part
in
the
task
before
them
patches
saw
the
whirling
rope
leave
phil
hand
and
saw
it
tighten
as
the
cowboy
threw
the
weight
of
his
horse
against
it
and
then
he
caught
a
confused
vision
a
fallen
struggling
horse
with
a
man
pinned
to
the
ground
beneath
him
and
a
wickedly
lowered
head
with
sharp
horns
and
angry
eyes
charging
straight
at
them
patches
did
not
think
there
was
no
time
to
think
with
a
yell
of
horror
he
struck
deep
with
both
spurs
and
his
startled
horse
leaped
forward
again
he
spurred
cruelly
with
all
his
strength
and
the
next
bound
of
his
frenzied
mount
carried
him
upon
those
deadly
horns
patches
remembered
hearing
a
sickening
rip
and
a
scream
of
fear
and
pain
as
he
felt
the
horse
under
him
rise
in
the
air
he
never
knew
how
he
managed
to
free
himself
as
he
fell
backward
with
his
struggling
mount
but
he
distinctly
saw
phil
regain
his
saddle
while
his
horse
was
in
the
very
act
of
struggling
to
its
feet
and
he
watched
with
anxious
interest
as
the
cowboy
forced
his
excited
mount
in
front
of
the
bull
to
attract
the
beast
wicked
attention
the
bull
accepting
the
tantalizing
challenge
charged
again
and
patches
with
a
thrill
of
admiration
for
the
man
coolness
and
skill
saw
that
phil
was
coiling
his
riata
even
while
his
frightened
horse
with
terrific
leaps
avoided
those
menacing
horns
the
bull
stopped
shook
his
head
in
anger
over
his
failure
and
looked
back
toward
the
man
on
foot
but
again
that
horse
and
rider
danced
temptingly
before
him
so
close
that
it
seemed
he
could
not
fail
and
again
he
charged
only
to
find
that
his
mad
rush
carried
him
still
further
from
the
helpless
patches
and
by
now
phil
had
recovered
his
riata
and
the
loop
was
whirling
in
easy
circles
about
his
head
the
as
though
feeling
the
security
that
was
in
that
familiar
motion
of
his
master
arm
steadied
himself
and
in
the
few
active
moments
that
followed
obedient
to
every
signal
of
his
rider
did
his
part
with
almost
human
intelligence
when
the
bull
was
safely
tied
phil
went
to
the
frightfully
injured
horse
and
with
a
merciful
bullet
ended
the
animal
suffering
then
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
patches
who
stood
gazing
ruefully
at
the
dead
animal
as
though
he
felt
himself
to
blame
for
the
loss
of
his
employer
property
a
slight
smile
lightened
the
cowboy
face
as
he
noticed
his
companion
troubled
thought
i
suppose
i
done
it
now
said
patches
as
though
expecting
censure
phil
smile
broadened
you
sure
have
he
returned
as
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
i
much
obliged
to
you
patches
looked
at
him
in
confused
embarrassment
do
you
know
that
you
saved
my
life
asked
phil
dryly
but
but
i
killed
a
good
horse
for
the
dean
stammered
patches
to
which
the
dean
foreman
returned
with
a
grin
i
reckon
uncle
will
can
stand
the
loss
considering
this
relieved
the
tension
and
they
laughed
together
but
tell
me
something
patches
said
phil
curiously
why
did
you
shoot
the
bull
when
he
charged
me
i
did
think
of
it
admitted
patches
i
did
really
think
of
anything
the
cowboy
nodded
with
understanding
approval
i
noticed
that
the
man
to
tie
to
in
sudden
trouble
is
the
man
who
does
have
to
think
the
man
i
mean
who
just
does
the
right
thing
instinctively
and
waits
to
think
about
it
afterwards
when
there
time
patches
was
pleased
i
did
the
right
thing
then
it
was
the
only
thing
you
do
to
save
my
life
returned
phil
seriously
if
you
had
tried
to
use
your
gun
even
if
you
could
have
managed
to
hit
him
you
would
have
stopped
him
in
time
if
you
had
been
where
you
could
have
put
a
bullet
between
his
eyes
it
might
have
worked
but
he
smiled
again
i
mighty
glad
you
did
think
to
try
any
experiments
tell
me
something
else
he
added
did
you
realize
the
chance
you
were
taking
for
yourself
patches
shook
his
head
i
ca
say
that
i
realized
anything
except
that
you
were
in
a
bad
fix
and
that
it
was
up
to
me
to
do
something
quick
how
did
it
happen
anyway
he
seemed
anxious
to
turn
the
conversation
diamond
stepped
in
that
hole
there
explained
phil
when
he
turned
over
i
sure
thought
it
was
all
day
for
me
believe
me
i
wo
forget
this
patches
for
another
moment
there
was
an
embarrassed
silence
then
patches
said
what
puzzles
me
is
why
you
did
take
a
shot
at
him
after
you
were
up
instead
of
risking
your
neck
again
trying
to
rope
him
why
there
was
no
use
killing
a
good
bull
as
long
as
there
was
any
other
way
it
my
business
to
keep
him
alive
that
what
i
started
in
to
do
was
it
and
thus
the
cowboy
in
a
simple
word
or
two
stated
the
creed
of
his
profession
a
creed
that
permits
no
consideration
of
personal
danger
or
discomfort
when
the
welfare
of
the
property
is
at
stake
when
they
had
removed
saddle
and
bridle
from
the
dead
horse
and
had
cleaned
the
ugly
wound
in
the
bull
side
phil
said
now
mr
honorable
patches
you
better
move
on
down
the
wash
a
piece
and
get
out
of
sight
behind
one
of
those
cedars
this
fellow
is
going
to
get
busy
again
when
i
let
him
up
i
come
along
when
i
got
rid
of
him
a
little
later
as
phil
rode
out
of
the
cedars
toward
patches
a
deep
bellowing
challenge
came
from
up
the
he
just
telling
us
what
he
do
to
us
the
next
chance
he
gets
chuckled
phil
hop
up
behind
me
now
and
we
go
home
the
gloom
that
all
day
had
seemed
to
overshadow
phil
was
effectually
banished
by
the
excitement
of
the
incident
and
he
was
again
his
sunny
cheerful
self
as
they
rode
they
chatted
and
laughed
merrily
then
suddenly
as
it
had
happened
that
morning
the
cowboy
was
again
grim
and
silent
patches
was
wondering
what
had
so
quickly
changed
his
companion
mood
when
he
caught
sight
of
two
horsemen
riding
along
the
top
of
the
ridge
that
forms
the
western
side
of
the
wash
their
course
paralleling
that
of
the
men
who
were
following
the
bed
of
the
wash
when
patches
directed
phil
attention
to
the
riders
the
cowboy
said
shortly
i
been
watching
them
for
the
last
ten
minutes
then
as
if
regretting
the
manner
of
his
reply
he
added
more
kindly
if
they
keep
on
the
way
they
going
we
likely
meet
them
about
a
mile
down
the
wash
where
the
ridge
breaks
do
you
know
them
asked
patches
curiously
it
nick
cambert
and
that
poor
lost
dog
of
a
yavapai
joe
phil
answered
the
tailholt
mountain
outfit
murmured
patches
watching
the
riders
on
the
ridge
with
quickened
interest
do
you
know
phil
i
believe
i
have
seen
those
fellows
before
you
have
exclaimed
phil
where
when
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
where
patches
replied
but
it
was
the
day
i
rode
the
drift
fence
they
were
on
a
ridge
across
a
little
valley
from
me
that
must
have
been
this
same
horse
wash
that
we
following
now
replied
phil
it
widens
out
a
bit
below
here
what
makes
you
think
it
was
nick
and
joe
why
those
fellows
up
there
look
like
the
two
that
i
saw
one
big
one
and
one
rather
lightweight
they
were
the
same
distance
from
me
you
know
and
yes
i
am
sure
those
are
the
same
horses
pretty
good
patches
but
you
ought
to
have
reported
it
when
you
got
home
why
i
did
think
it
of
any
importance
there
are
two
rules
that
you
must
follow
always
said
the
cowboy
if
you
are
going
to
learn
to
be
a
top
hand
in
this
business
the
first
is
to
see
everything
that
there
is
to
see
and
to
see
everything
about
everything
that
you
see
and
the
second
is
to
remember
it
all
i
mind
telling
you
now
that
jim
reid
found
a
calf
with
the
tailholt
iron
that
same
afternoon
in
that
same
neighborhood
and
that
on
our
side
of
the
drift
fence
he
ran
onto
a
cow
that
had
lost
her
calf
there
come
our
friends
now
the
two
horsemen
were
riding
down
the
side
of
the
hill
at
an
angle
that
would
bring
about
the
meeting
which
phil
had
foreseen
and
patches
immediately
broke
the
first
of
the
two
rules
for
while
watching
the
riders
he
did
not
notice
that
his
companion
loosened
his
gun
in
its
holster
nick
cambert
was
a
large
man
and
heavy
with
sandy
hair
and
those
peculiar
light
blue
eyes
which
do
not
beget
confidence
but
as
the
tailholt
mountain
men
halted
to
greet
phil
patches
gave
to
nick
little
more
than
a
passing
glance
so
interested
was
he
in
the
big
companion
it
is
doubtful
if
blood
training
environment
circumstances
the
fates
or
whatever
it
is
that
gives
to
men
individuality
ever
marked
a
man
with
less
manhood
than
was
given
to
poor
yavapai
joe
standing
erect
he
would
have
been
perhaps
a
little
above
medium
height
but
thin
and
stooped
with
a
look
as
he
slouched
listlessly
in
the
saddle
it
was
almost
impossible
to
think
of
him
as
a
matured
man
the
receding
chin
and
coarse
loosely
opened
mouth
the
pale
lifeless
eyes
set
too
closely
together
under
a
low
forehead
with
a
ragged
thatch
of
dead
hair
and
a
furtive
sneaking
expression
proclaimed
him
the
outcast
that
he
was
the
big
man
eyed
patches
as
he
greeted
the
foreman
howdy
phil
hello
nick
returned
phil
coldly
howdy
joe
the
younger
man
who
was
gazing
stupidly
at
patches
returned
the
salutation
with
an
unintelligible
mumble
and
proceeded
to
roll
a
cigarette
you
folks
at
the
short
of
horses
asked
nick
with
an
evident
attempt
at
jocularity
alluding
to
the
situation
of
the
two
men
who
were
riding
one
horse
we
got
mixed
up
with
a
bull
back
yonder
phil
explained
briefly
they
can
sure
put
a
horse
out
o
the
game
mighty
quick
sometimes
commented
the
other
i
lost
a
few
that
way
myself
it
about
as
far
from
here
to
my
place
as
it
is
to
baldwin
or
i
help
you
out
welcome
you
know
much
obliged
returned
phil
but
we
make
it
home
all
right
i
reckon
we
better
be
moving
though
so
long
adios
throughout
this
brief
exchange
of
courtesies
yavapai
joe
had
not
moved
except
to
puff
at
his
cigarette
nor
had
he
ceased
to
regard
patches
with
a
stupid
curiosity
as
phil
and
patches
moved
away
he
still
sat
gazing
after
the
stranger
until
he
was
aroused
by
a
sharp
word
from
nick
as
the
latter
turned
his
horse
toward
tailholt
mountain
without
changing
his
slouching
position
in
the
saddle
and
with
a
final
slinking
sidewise
look
toward
patches
the
poor
fellow
obediently
trailed
after
his
master
patches
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
turn
for
another
look
at
the
wretched
shadow
of
manhood
that
so
interested
him
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
pair
asked
phil
breaking
in
upon
his
companion
preoccupation
patches
shrugged
his
shoulders
much
as
he
had
done
that
day
of
his
first
experience
with
the
screwworms
then
he
said
quietly
do
you
mind
telling
me
about
them
phil
why
there
not
much
to
tell
returned
the
cowboy
that
is
not
much
that
anybody
knows
for
certain
nick
was
born
in
yavapai
county
his
father
old
george
cambert
was
one
of
the
kind
that
seems
honest
enough
and
industrious
too
but
somehow
always
just
misses
it
they
moved
away
to
some
place
in
southern
california
when
nick
was
about
grown
he
came
back
six
years
ago
and
located
over
there
at
the
foot
of
tailholt
mountain
and
started
his
iron
and
one
way
or
another
he
managed
to
get
together
quite
a
bunch
of
stock
you
see
his
expenses
do
amount
to
anything
scarcely
he
and
joe
bach
in
an
old
shack
that
somebody
built
years
ago
and
they
do
all
the
riding
themselves
joe
not
much
force
but
he
handier
than
you
think
as
long
as
there
somebody
around
to
tell
him
what
to
do
and
sort
of
back
him
up
nick
though
can
do
two
men
work
any
day
in
the
year
but
it
strange
that
a
man
like
nick
would
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
creature
as
that
poor
specimen
mused
patches
are
they
related
in
any
way
nobody
knows
answered
phil
joe
first
showed
up
at
prescott
about
four
years
ago
with
a
man
by
the
name
of
dryden
who
claimed
that
joe
was
his
son
they
camped
just
outside
of
town
in
some
dirty
old
tents
and
lived
by
picking
up
whatever
was
lying
around
loose
dryden
work
and
naturally
no
one
would
have
joe
finally
dryden
was
sent
up
for
robbing
a
store
and
joe
nearly
went
with
him
they
let
him
off
i
believe
because
it
was
proved
pretty
well
that
he
was
only
tool
and
did
have
nerve
enough
to
do
any
real
harm
by
himself
he
drifted
around
for
several
months
living
like
a
stray
cur
until
nick
took
him
in
tow
nick
treats
him
shamefully
abuses
him
like
a
beast
and
works
him
like
a
slave
the
poor
devil
stays
on
with
him
because
he
does
know
what
else
to
do
i
suppose
is
he
always
like
we
saw
him
asked
patches
who
seemed
strangely
interested
in
this
bit
of
human
drift
does
he
ever
talk
oh
yes
he
talk
all
right
when
nick
is
around
or
when
there
are
not
too
many
present
get
off
somewhere
alone
with
him
after
he
gets
acquainted
a
little
and
he
not
half
such
bad
company
as
he
looks
i
reckon
that
the
main
reason
why
nick
keeps
him
you
see
no
decent
would
dare
work
at
tailholt
mountain
and
a
man
gets
mighty
lonesome
living
so
much
alone
but
joe
never
talks
about
where
he
came
from
or
who
he
is
shuts
up
like
a
clam
if
you
so
much
as
mention
anything
that
looks
like
you
were
trying
to
find
out
about
him
he
not
such
a
fool
as
he
looks
either
so
far
as
that
goes
but
he
always
got
that
sneaking
coyote
sort
of
look
and
whatever
he
does
he
does
in
that
same
way
in
other
words
commented
patches
thoughtfully
poor
joe
must
have
someone
to
depend
on
taken
alone
he
counts
no
more
than
a
cipher
that
it
said
phil
with
somebody
to
feed
him
and
think
for
him
and
take
care
of
him
and
be
responsible
for
him
in
some
sort
of
a
way
he
makes
almost
one
after
all
phil
said
patches
with
bitter
sarcasm
poor
yavapai
joe
is
not
so
much
different
from
hundreds
of
men
that
i
know
by
their
standards
he
should
be
envied
phil
was
amazed
at
his
companion
words
for
they
seemed
to
hint
at
something
in
the
man
past
and
patches
so
far
as
his
reticence
upon
any
subject
that
approached
his
own
history
was
always
as
silent
as
yavapai
joe
himself
what
do
you
mean
by
that
phil
demanded
what
sort
of
men
do
you
mean
i
mean
the
sort
that
never
do
anything
of
their
own
free
wills
the
sort
that
have
someone
else
to
think
for
them
and
feed
them
and
take
care
of
them
and
take
all
the
responsibility
for
what
they
do
or
do
not
do
i
mean
those
who
are
dependents
and
those
who
aspire
to
be
dependent
i
ca
see
that
it
makes
any
essential
difference
whether
they
have
inherited
wealth
and
what
we
call
culture
or
whether
they
are
like
joe
the
principle
is
the
same
as
they
dismounted
at
the
home
corral
gate
phil
looked
at
his
companion
curiously
you
seem
mighty
interested
in
joe
he
said
with
a
smile
i
am
retorted
patches
he
reminds
me
of
of
some
one
i
know
he
finished
with
his
old
smile
i
have
a
fellow
feeling
for
him
the
same
as
you
have
for
that
wild
horse
you
know
i
like
to
take
him
away
from
nick
and
see
if
it
would
be
possible
to
make
a
real
man
of
him
he
mused
more
to
himself
than
to
his
companion
i
do
believe
i
try
any
experiments
along
that
line
patches
cautioned
phil
you
got
to
have
something
to
build
on
when
you
start
to
make
a
man
the
raw
material
is
not
in
joe
and
besides
he
added
significantly
folks
might
not
understand
patches
laughed
bitterly
i
have
my
hands
full
now
the
next
morning
the
foreman
said
that
he
would
give
that
day
to
the
horses
he
was
training
and
sent
patches
alone
after
the
saddle
and
bridle
which
they
had
left
near
the
scene
of
the
accident
you
ca
miss
finding
the
place
again
he
said
to
patches
just
follow
up
the
you
be
back
by
noon
if
you
do
try
any
experiments
he
added
laughing
patches
had
ridden
as
far
as
the
spot
where
he
and
phil
had
met
the
tailholt
mountain
men
and
was
thirsty
he
thought
of
the
distance
he
had
yet
to
go
and
then
of
the
return
back
to
the
ranch
in
the
heat
of
the
day
he
remembered
that
phil
had
told
him
as
they
were
riding
out
the
morning
before
of
a
spring
a
little
way
up
the
small
side
canyon
that
opens
into
the
main
wash
through
that
break
in
the
ridge
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
he
turned
aside
determined
to
find
the
water
riding
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
into
that
narrow
gap
in
the
ridge
he
found
the
way
suddenly
becoming
steep
and
roughly
strewn
with
boulders
and
thinking
to
make
better
time
left
his
horse
tied
to
a
bush
in
the
shadow
of
the
rocky
wall
while
he
climbed
up
the
dry
watercourse
on
foot
he
found
as
phil
had
said
that
it
was
not
far
another
hundred
yards
up
the
break
in
the
ridge
and
he
came
out
into
a
beautiful
glade
where
he
found
the
spring
clear
and
cold
under
a
rock
in
the
deep
shade
of
an
old
gnarled
and
twisted
cedar
gratefully
he
threw
himself
down
and
drank
long
and
deep
then
sat
for
a
few
moments
rest
before
making
his
way
back
to
his
horse
the
moist
black
earth
of
the
cuplike
hollow
was
roughly
trampled
by
the
cattle
that
knew
the
spot
and
there
were
trails
leading
down
through
the
heavy
growth
of
brush
and
trees
that
clothed
the
hillsides
so
dense
was
this
forest
growth
and
so
narrow
the
glade
that
the
sunlight
only
reached
the
cool
retreat
through
a
network
of
leaves
and
branches
in
spots
and
bars
of
brightness
nor
could
one
see
very
far
through
the
living
screens
patches
was
on
the
point
of
going
when
he
heard
voices
and
the
sound
of
horses
feet
somewhere
above
for
a
moment
he
sat
silently
listening
then
he
realized
that
the
riders
were
approaching
down
one
of
the
cattle
trails
a
moment
more
and
he
thought
he
recognized
one
of
the
voices
there
was
a
low
murmuring
whining
tone
and
then
a
rough
heavy
voice
raised
seemingly
in
anger
patches
felt
sure
now
that
he
knew
the
speakers
and
obeying
one
of
those
impulses
that
so
often
prompted
his
actions
he
slipped
quietly
into
the
dense
growth
on
the
side
of
the
glade
opposite
the
approaching
riders
he
was
scarcely
hidden
a
hundred
feet
or
so
from
the
spring
when
nick
cambert
and
yavapai
joe
rode
into
the
glade
if
patches
had
paused
to
think
he
likely
would
have
disdained
to
play
the
part
of
a
hidden
spy
but
he
had
acted
without
thinking
and
no
sooner
was
he
concealed
than
he
realized
that
it
was
too
late
so
he
smiled
mockingly
at
himself
and
awaited
developments
he
had
heard
and
seen
enough
since
he
had
been
in
the
dean
employ
to
understand
the
suspicion
in
which
the
owner
of
the
iron
was
held
and
from
even
his
few
days
work
on
the
range
in
company
with
phil
he
had
come
to
understand
how
difficult
it
was
for
the
cattlemen
to
prove
anything
against
the
man
who
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
was
stealing
their
stock
it
was
the
possibility
of
getting
some
positive
evidence
and
of
thus
protecting
his
employer
property
that
had
really
prompted
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
chance
situation
as
the
two
men
appeared
it
was
clear
to
the
hidden
observer
that
the
weakling
had
in
some
way
incurred
his
master
displeasure
the
big
man
face
was
red
with
anger
and
his
eyes
were
hard
and
cruel
while
joe
had
more
than
aver
the
look
of
a
lost
dog
that
expects
nothing
less
than
a
curse
and
a
kick
nick
drank
at
the
spring
then
turned
back
to
his
companion
who
had
not
dismounted
but
sat
on
his
horse
cringing
and
frightened
trying
with
fluttering
fingers
to
roll
a
cigarette
a
moment
the
big
man
surveyed
his
trembling
follower
then
taking
a
heavy
quirt
from
his
saddle
he
said
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
well
why
do
you
get
your
drink
i
ai
thirsty
nick
faltered
the
other
you
ai
thirsty
mocked
the
man
with
a
jeering
laugh
you
lying
an
you
know
it
get
down
hones
to
god
nick
i
do
want
no
drink
whimpered
joe
as
his
master
toyed
with
the
quirt
suggestively
get
down
i
tell
you
commanded
the
big
man
joe
obeyed
his
thin
form
shaking
with
fear
and
stood
shrinking
against
his
horse
side
his
fearful
eyes
fixed
on
the
man
now
come
here
do
nick
for
god
sake
do
hit
me
i
did
mean
no
harm
let
me
off
this
time
wo
you
nick
come
here
you
got
it
comin
damn
you
an
you
know
it
come
here
i
say
as
if
it
were
beyond
his
power
to
refuse
the
wretched
creature
took
a
halting
step
or
two
toward
the
man
whose
brutal
will
dominated
him
then
he
paused
and
half
turned
as
if
to
attempt
escape
but
that
menacing
voice
stopped
him
come
here
whimpering
and
begging
with
disconnected
unintelligible
words
the
poor
fellow
again
started
toward
the
man
with
the
quirt
at
the
critical
moment
a
quiet
voice
interrupted
the
scene
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
cambert
nick
whirled
with
an
oath
of
surprise
and
astonishment
to
face
patches
who
was
coming
leisurely
toward
him
from
the
bushes
above
the
spring
what
are
you
doin
here
demanded
nick
while
his
victim
slunk
back
to
his
horse
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
intruder
with
dumb
amazement
i
came
for
a
drink
returned
patches
coolly
excellent
water
it
and
the
day
is
really
quite
warm
makes
one
appreciate
such
a
delightfully
cool
retreat
do
you
think
heard
us
comin
an
thought
you
play
the
spy
did
you
growled
the
tailholt
mountain
man
patches
smiled
really
you
know
i
am
afraid
i
did
think
much
about
it
he
said
gently
i
troubled
that
way
you
see
he
explained
with
elaborate
politeness
often
do
things
upon
impulse
do
you
know
beastly
embarrassing
sometimes
nick
glared
at
this
polite
gentleman
with
anger
i
heard
there
was
a
dude
tenderfoot
hangin
the
he
said
at
last
you
sure
a
hell
of
a
fine
specimen
you
had
your
drink
now
you
get
i
beg
pardon
drawled
patches
looking
at
him
with
innocent
inquiry
vamoose
get
out
go
on
about
your
business
really
cambert
i
understood
that
this
was
open
range
patches
looked
about
as
though
carefully
assuring
himself
that
he
was
not
mistaken
in
the
spot
the
big
man
eyes
narrowed
wickedly
it
closed
to
you
all
right
then
as
patches
did
not
move
well
are
you
goin
or
have
i
got
to
start
you
he
took
a
threatening
step
toward
the
intruder
no
returned
patches
easily
i
am
certainly
not
going
not
just
at
present
and
he
added
thoughtfully
if
i
were
you
i
would
try
to
start
something
in
the
extraordinary
of
this
stranger
made
the
big
man
hesitate
oh
you
would
heh
he
returned
you
mean
i
that
you
propose
to
interfere
with
my
business
if
by
your
business
you
mean
beating
a
man
who
is
so
unable
to
protect
himself
i
certainly
propose
to
interfere
for
a
moment
nick
glared
at
patches
as
though
doubting
his
own
ears
then
rage
at
the
tenderfoot
insolence
mastered
him
with
a
vile
epithet
he
caught
the
loaded
quirt
in
his
hand
by
its
small
end
and
strode
toward
the
intruder
but
even
as
the
big
man
swung
his
wicked
weapon
aloft
a
hard
fist
with
the
weight
of
a
and
shoulder
back
of
it
found
the
point
of
his
chin
with
scientific
accuracy
the
force
of
the
blow
augmented
as
it
was
by
nick
weight
as
he
was
rushing
to
meet
it
was
terrific
the
man
head
snapped
back
and
he
spun
half
around
as
he
fell
so
that
the
uplifted
arm
with
its
threatening
weapon
was
twisted
under
the
heavy
bulk
that
lay
quivering
and
harmless
patches
coolly
bent
over
the
unconscious
man
and
extracted
his
gun
from
the
holster
then
stepping
back
a
few
paces
he
quietly
waited
yavapai
joe
who
had
viewed
the
proceedings
thus
far
with
gaping
mouth
and
frightened
wonder
scrambled
into
his
saddle
and
reined
his
horse
about
as
if
to
ride
for
his
life
wait
joe
called
patches
sharply
the
weakling
paused
in
pitiful
indecision
nick
will
be
all
right
in
a
few
minutes
continued
the
stranger
reassuringly
stay
where
you
are
even
as
he
spoke
the
man
on
the
ground
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
gazed
about
collecting
his
shocked
and
scattered
senses
then
with
a
mad
roar
he
got
to
his
feet
and
reached
for
his
gun
but
when
his
hand
touched
the
empty
holster
a
look
of
dismay
swept
over
his
heavy
face
and
he
looked
doubtfully
toward
patches
with
a
degree
of
respect
and
a
somewhat
humbled
air
yes
i
have
your
gun
said
patches
soothingly
you
see
i
thought
it
would
be
best
to
remove
the
temptation
you
do
really
want
to
shoot
me
anyway
you
know
you
only
think
you
do
when
you
have
had
time
to
consider
it
all
calmly
you
thank
me
because
do
you
see
i
would
make
you
a
lot
more
trouble
dead
than
i
could
possibly
alive
i
do
think
that
baldwin
would
like
to
have
me
all
shot
to
pieces
particularly
if
the
shooting
were
done
by
someone
from
tailholt
mountain
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
horse
phil
would
be
very
much
put
out
about
it
well
what
do
you
want
growled
nick
you
got
the
drop
on
me
what
are
you
after
anyway
what
peculiar
expressions
you
western
people
use
murmured
patches
sweetly
you
say
that
i
have
got
the
drop
on
you
when
to
be
exact
you
should
have
said
that
you
got
the
drop
me
do
you
see
good
is
it
nick
effort
at
was
heroic
patches
watched
him
with
an
insolent
taunting
smile
that
goaded
the
man
to
reckless
speech
if
you
did
have
that
gun
i
the
big
man
began
then
stopped
for
as
he
spoke
patches
placed
the
weapon
carefully
on
a
rock
and
went
toward
him
barehanded
you
would
do
what
at
the
crisp
eager
question
that
came
in
such
sharp
contrast
to
patches
former
speech
nick
hesitated
and
drew
back
a
step
patches
promptly
moved
a
step
nearer
and
his
words
came
now
in
answer
to
the
unfinished
threat
with
cutting
force
what
would
you
do
you
big
hulking
swine
you
can
bully
a
weakling
not
half
your
size
you
can
beat
a
helpless
incompetent
like
a
dog
you
can
bluster
and
threaten
a
tenderfoot
when
you
think
he
fears
you
you
can
attack
a
man
with
a
loaded
quirt
when
you
think
him
unable
to
defend
himself
show
me
what
you
can
do
the
tailholt
mountain
man
drew
back
another
step
patches
continued
his
remarks
you

a
healthy
specimen

are

have
the
frame
of
a
bull

the
spirit
of

courage
of
a
sucking
dove

your
own
vernacular

superior

sullenly
nick
cambert
mounted
his
horse
and
turned
away
toward
one
of
the
trails
leading
out
from
the
little
arena
come
along
joe
he
called
to
his
follower

decisive
force

nick
paused
what

he
growled
i
mean
returned
patches
that

is
free
to
go
with
you
or

he
chooses
joe
he
continued
addressing
the
cause
of
the
controversy

man

he
turned
to
ride
on
and
joe
with
a
slinking
sidewise
look
at
patches
started
to
follow
again
patches
called
wait
joe
and
his
voice
was
almost
pleading
ca

to

follower
as

or

i
got
to
go
and
get
you
with
a
sickening
hangdog
look
joe
mumbled
something
and
rode
after
his
master
as
they
disappeared
up
the
trail
nick
called
back
i
get
you
yet
you
sneakin
spy
not
after
you
had
time
to
think
it
over
answered
patches
cheerfully
it
would
interfere
too
much
with
your
business
leave
your
gun
at
the
gate
of
that
old
corral
up
the
joe
for
a
few
moments
longer
the
strange
man
stood
in
the
glade
listening
to
the
vanishing
sounds
of
their
going
while
that
mirthless
smile
curved
his
lips
poor
devil
he
muttered
sadly
as
he
turned
at
last
to
make
his
way
back
to
his
horse
poor
joe
i
know
just
how
he
feels
it
hard
beastly
hard
to
break
away
i
afraid
i
have
made
trouble
for
you
sir
patches
said
ruefully
to
the
dean
as
he
briefly
related
the
incident
to
his
employer
and
to
phil
that
afternoon
i
sorry
i
really
did
stop
to
think
trouble
retorted
the
dean
his
eyes
twinkling
approval
while
phil
laughed
joyously
why
man
we
been
prayin
for
trouble
with
that
blamed
tailholt
mountain
outfit
you
a
plumb
wonder
young
man
but
what
in
thunder
was
you
aimin
to
do
with
that
ornery
yavapai
joe
if
he
a
took
you
up
on
your
fool
proposition
really
to
tell
the
truth
murmured
patches
i
do
exactly
know
i
fancied
the
experiment
would
be
interesting
and
i
was
so
sorry
for
the
poor
chap
that
i
he
stopped
shamefaced
to
join
in
the
laugh
but
later
the
dean
and
phil
talked
together
privately
with
the
result
that
during
the
days
that
followed
as
patches
and
his
teacher
rode
the
range
together
the
pupil
found
revolver
practice
added
to
his
studies
the
art
of
drawing
and
shooting
a
with
quickness
and
certainty
was
often
a
useful
part
of
the
cowboy
training
phil
explained
cheerfully
in
the
case
for
instance
of
a
mixup
with
a
bad
steer
when
your
horse
falls
or
something
like
that

chapter
x
the
rodeo
as
the
remaining
weeks
of
the
summer
passed
patches
spent
the
days
riding
the
range
with
phil
and
under
the
careful
eye
of
that
experienced
teacher
made
rapid
progress
in
the
work
he
had
chosen
to
master
the
man
intense
desire
to
succeed
his
quick
intelligence
with
his
instinct
for
acting
without
hesitation
and
his
reckless
disregard
for
personal
injury
together
with
his
splendid
physical
strength
led
him
to
a
mastery
of
the
details
of
a
cowboy
work
with
remarkable
readiness
occasionally
the
two
riders
saw
the
men
from
tailholt
mountain
sometimes
merely
sighting
them
in
the
distance
and
again
meeting
them
face
to
face
at
some
watering
place
or
on
the
range
when
it
happened
that
nick
cambert
was
thus
forced
to
keep
up
a
show
of
friendly
relations
with
the
the
few
commonplaces
of
the
country
were
exchanged
but
always
the
tailholt
mountain
man
addressed
his
words
to
phil
and
save
for
surly
looks
ignored
the
companion
he
had
evidently
as
patches
had
said
that
he
would
come
to
realize
that
he
could
not
afford
to
arouse
the
cattlemen
to
action
against
him
as
he
would
certainly
have
done
had
he
attempted
to
carry
out
his
threat
to
get
the
man
who
had
so
humiliated
him
but
patches
strange
interest
in
yavapai
joe
in
no
way
lessened
always
he
had
a
kindly
word
for
the
poor
unfortunate
and
sought
persistently
to
win
the
weakling
friendship
and
phil
seeing
this
wondered
but
held
his
peace
frequently
kitty
reid
sometimes
alone
often
with
the
other
members
of
the
reid
household
came
across
the
big
meadow
to
spend
an
evening
at
the
neighboring
ranch
sometimes
phil
and
patches
stopping
at
the
home
ranch
at
the
close
of
the
day
for
a
drink
at
the
windmill
pump
would
linger
a
while
for
a
chat
with
kitty
who
would
come
from
the
house
to
greet
them
and
now
and
then
kitty
out
for
a
ride
on
midnight
would
chance
to
meet
the
two
men
on
the
range
and
so
would
accompany
them
for
an
hour
or
more
and
thus
the
acquaintance
between
patches
and
the
girl
grew
into
friendship
for
kitty
loved
to
talk
with
this
man
of
the
things
that
play
so
large
a
part
in
that
life
which
so
appealed
to
her
and
with
phil
and
hearty
endorsement
of
patches
she
felt
safe
in
permitting
the
friendship
to
develop
and
patches
quietly
observing
with
now
and
then
a
conversational
experiment
at
which
game
he
was
an
adepts
came
to
understand
almost
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
told
phil
love
for
kitty
and
her
attitude
toward
the
cowboy
her
schoolmate
and
sweetheart
many
times
when
the
three
were
together
and
the
talk
guided
by
kitty
led
far
from
phil
world
the
cowboy
would
sit
a
silent
listener
until
patches
would
skillfully
turn
the
current
back
to
the
land
of
granite
mountain
and
the
life
in
which
phil
had
so
vital
a
part
in
the
at
the
too
patches
gradually
came
to
hold
his
own
peculiar
place
his
cheerful
helpfulness
and
gentle
courtesy
no
less
than
the
secret
pain
and
sadness
that
sometimes
at
some
chance
remark
drove
the
light
from
his
face
and
brought
that
wistful
look
into
his
eyes
won
baldwin
heart
many
an
evening
under
his
walnut
trees
with
stella
and
phil
and
curly
and
bob
and
little
billy
near
the
dean
was
led
by
the
rare
skill
and
ready
wit
of
patches
to
open
the
book
of
his
kindly
philosophy
as
he
talked
of
the
years
that
were
past
and
sometimes
patches
himself
yielding
to
temptation
offered
by
the
dean
would
speak
in
such
vein
that
the
older
man
came
to
understand
that
this
boy
as
he
so
often
called
him
had
somewhere
somehow
already
experienced
that
gethsemane
which
soon
or
late
the
dean
maintains
leaves
its
shadow
upon
us
all
the
cowboys
for
his
quick
and
genuine
appreciation
of
their
skill
and
knowledge
as
well
as
for
his
unassuming
courage
hearty
good
nature
and
ready
laugh
took
him
into
their
fellowship
without
question
or
reserve
while
little
billy
loyal
ever
to
his
ideal
wild
horse
phil
found
a
large
place
in
his
boyish
heart
for
the
tenderfoot
who
was
so
ready
always
to
recognize
superior
wisdom
and
authority
so
the
stranger
found
his
place
among
them
and
in
finding
it
found
also
perhaps
that
which
he
most
sorely
needed
illustration
when
rodeo
time
came
patches
was
given
a
string
of
horses
and
through
the
hard
grilling
work
that
followed
took
his
place
among
the
riders
there
was
no
leisurely
roaming
over
the
range
now
with
only
an
occasional
short
dash
after
some
animal
that
needed
the
iron
or
the
dope
can
but
systematically
and
thoroughly
the
thirty
or
forty
cowboys
covered
the
country
mountain
and
mesa
and
flat
and
wash
and
timbered
ridge
and
rocky
pass
for
many
miles
in
every
direction
in
this
section
of
the
great
western
cattle
country
at
the
time
of
my
story
the
were
cooperative
each
of
the
several
ranchers
whose
cattle
marked
by
the
owner
legally
recorded
brand
ranged
over
a
common
district
that
was
defined
only
by
natural
boundaries
was
represented
in
the
rodeo
by
one
or
two
or
more
of
his
cowboys
the
number
of
his
riders
being
relative
to
the
number
of
cattle
marked
with
his
iron
this
company
of
riders
each
with
from
three
to
five
saddle
horses
in
his
string
would
assemble
at
one
of
the
ranches
participating
in
the
rodeo
from
this
center
they
would
work
until
a
circle
of
country
within
riding
distance
was
covered
the
cattle
gathered
and
worked
or
in
other
words
sorted
and
the
animals
belonging
to
the
various
owners
disposed
of
as
the
representatives
were
instructed
by
their
employers
then
the
rodeo
would
move
to
another
ranch
and
would
so
continue
until
the
entire
district
of
many
miles
was
covered
the
owner
or
the
foreman
of
each
ranch
was
in
charge
of
the
rodeo
as
long
as
the
riders
worked
in
his
territory
when
the
company
moved
to
the
next
point
this
loader
took
his
place
in
the
ranks
and
cheerfully
received
his
orders
from
some
comrade
who
the
day
before
had
been
as
willingly
obedient
to
him
there
was
little
place
in
the
rodeo
for
weak
incompetent
or
untrustworthy
men
each
owner
from
his
long
experience
and
knowledge
of
men
sent
as
his
representatives
the
most
skillful
and
conscientious
riders
that
he
could
secure
to
make
a
top
hand
at
a
rodeo
a
man
needed
to
be
in
the
truest
sense
a
man
before
daylight
the
horse
wrangler
had
driven
in
the
saddle
band
and
the
men
with
nose
bags
fashioned
from
grain
sacks
were
out
in
the
corral
to
give
the
animals
their
feed
of
barley
the
gray
quiet
of
the
early
dawn
was
rudely
broken
by
the
sounds
of
the
crowding
jostling
kicking
squealing
band
mingled
with
the
merry
voices
of
the
men
with
now
and
then
a
shout
of
anger
or
warning
as
the
cowboys
moved
here
and
there
among
their
restless
companions
and
always
like
a
deep
undertone
came
the
sound
of
trampling
hoofs
before
the
sky
had
changed
to
crimson
and
gold
the
call
sounded
from
the
ranch
house
come
and
get
it
and
laughing
and
joking
in
friendly
rivalry
the
boys
rushed
to
breakfast
it
was
no
dainty
meal
of
toast
and
light
cereals
that
these
hardy
ones
demanded
but
huge
cuts
of
beef
with
slabs
of
bread
and
piles
of
potatoes
and
stacks
of
hot
cakes
and
buckets
of
coffee
and
whatever
else
the
chinaman
could
lay
his
hands
on
to
satisfy
their
needs
as
soon
as
each
man
reached
the
utmost
limit
of
his
capacity
he
left
the
table
without
formality
and
returned
to
the
corral
where
with
riata
or
persuasion
as
the
case
demanded
he
selected
from
his
individual
string
of
horses
his
first
mount
for
the
day
by
the
time
the
sun
was
beginning
to
gild
the
summit
of
old
granite
mountain
walls
and
touch
with
glorious
color
the
peaks
of
the
neighboring
sentinel
hills
the
last
rider
had
saddled
and
the
company
was
mounted
and
ready
for
their
foreman
word
then
to
the
music
of
jingling
spurs
tinkling
bridle
chains
squeaking
saddle
leather
and
the
softer
swish
and
rustle
and
flap
of
chaps
romals
and
riatas
they
rode
forth
laughing
and
joking
still
with
now
and
then
a
roaring
chorus
of
shouting
comment
or
wild
yells
as
some
horse
gave
an
exhibition
of
his
prowess
in
a
mad
effort
to
unseat
his
grinning
rider
soon
the
leader
would
call
the
name
of
a
cowboy
known
to
be
particularly
familiar
with
the
country
which
was
to
be
the
scene
of
that
day
work
and
telling
him
to
take
two
or
three
or
more
men
as
the
case
might
be
would
direct
him
to
ride
over
a
certain
section
indicating
the
assigned
territory
by
its
natural
marks
of
valley
or
flat
or
wash
or
ridge
and
designating
the
point
where
the
cattle
would
first
be
brought
together
the
cowboy
named
would
rein
his
horse
aside
from
the
main
company
calling
the
men
of
his
choice
as
he
did
so
and
a
moment
later
with
his
companions
would
be
lost
to
sight
a
little
farther
and
again
the
foreman
would
name
a
rider
and
telling
him
to
pick
his
men
would
assign
to
him
another
section
of
the
district
to
be
covered
and
this
cowboy
with
his
chosen
mates
would
ride
away
these
smaller
groups
would
in
their
turn
separate
and
thus
the
entire
company
of
riders
would
open
out
like
a
huge
fan
to
sweep
the
countryside
it
was
no
mere
pleasure
canter
along
smoothly
graded
bridle
paths
or
country
highways
that
these
men
rode
from
roughest
mountain
side
and
slope
from
watercourse
and
tangled
brush
they
must
drive
in
the
scattered
cattle
at
reckless
speed
as
their
quarry
ran
and
turned
and
dodged
they
must
hesitate
at
nothing
climbing
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
scrambling
catlike
to
the
ragged
crests
of
the
ridges
sliding
down
the
bluffs
jumping
deep
arroyos
leaping
brush
and
boulders
twisting
dodging
through
the
timber
they
must
go
as
fast
as
the
strength
and
endurance
of
their
mounts
would
permit
and
so
gradually
as
the
sun
climbed
higher
above
the
peaks
and
crags
of
old
granite
the
great
living
fan
of
men
and
horses
closed
the
courses
of
the
widely
scattered
riders
leading
them
with
the
cattle
they
had
found
to
the
given
point
and
now
the
cattle
urged
by
the
active
horsemen
came
streaming
from
the
different
sections
to
form
the
herd
and
the
quiet
of
the
great
range
was
broken
by
the
bawling
of
confused
and
frightened
calves
the
lowing
of
anxious
mothers
the
shrill
call
of
the
steers
and
the
deep
bellowing
of
the
bulls
as
the
animals
so
rudely
driven
from
their
peaceful
feeding
grounds
moved
restlessly
within
the
circle
of
guarding
cowboys
while
cows
found
their
calves
and
the
monarchs
of
the
range
met
in
fierce
combat
a
number
of
the
men
those
whose
mounts
most
needed
the
rest
were
now
left
to
hold
the
herd
or
perhaps
to
move
it
quietly
on
to
some
other
point
while
the
others
were
again
sent
out
to
cover
another
section
of
the
territory
included
in
that
day
riding
as
the
hours
passed
and
the
great
fan
of
horsemen
opened
and
closed
sweeping
the
cattle
scattered
over
the
range
into
the
steadily
growing
herd
the
rodeo
moved
gradually
toward
some
chosen
open
flat
or
valley
that
afforded
a
space
large
enough
for
the
operations
that
followed
the
work
of
gathering
at
this
rodeo
ground
a
man
would
be
waiting
with
fresh
mounts
for
the
riders
and
sometimes
with
lunch
quickly
those
whose
names
were
called
by
the
foreman
would
change
their
saddles
from
dripping
exhausted
horses
to
fresh
animals
from
their
individual
strings
snatch
a
hasty
lunch
often
to
be
eaten
in
the
saddle
and
then
in
their
turn
would
hold
the
cattle
while
their
companions
followed
their
example
then
came
the
fast
hot
work
of
parting
the
cattle
the
representatives
from
one
of
the
ranches
interested
would
ride
in
among
the
cattle
held
by
the
circle
of
cowboys
and
following
their
instructions
would
select
such
animals
bearing
their
employer
brand
as
were
wanted
cutting
them
out
and
passing
them
through
the
line
of
guarding
riders
to
be
held
in
a
separate
group
when
the
representatives
of
one
owner
had
finished
they
were
followed
by
the
men
who
rode
for
some
other
outfit
and
so
on
until
the
task
of
parting
was
finished
as
the
afternoon
sun
moved
steadily
toward
the
skyline
of
the
western
hills
the
tireless
activity
of
men
and
horses
continued
the
cattle
as
the
mounted
men
moved
among
them
drifted
about
crowding
and
jostling
in
uneasy
discontent
with
sometimes
an
indignant
protest
and
many
attempts
at
escape
by
the
more
restless
and
venturesome
when
an
animal
was
singled
out
the
parting
horses
chosen
and
prized
for
their
quickness
dashed
here
and
there
through
the
herd
with
fierce
leaps
and
furious
rushes
stopping
short
in
a
terrific
sprint
to
whirl
flashlike
and
charge
in
another
direction
as
the
quarry
dodged
and
doubled
and
now
and
then
an
animal
would
succeed
for
the
moment
in
passing
the
guard
line
only
to
be
brought
back
after
a
short
sharp
chase
by
the
nearest
cowboy
from
the
rodeo
ground
where
for
long
years
the
grass
had
been
trampled
out
the
dust
lifted
by
the
trampling
thousands
of
hoofs
in
a
dense
choking
cloud
and
heavy
with
the
pungent
odor
of
warm
cattle
and
the
smell
of
sweating
horses
rising
high
into
the
clear
air
could
be
seen
from
miles
away
while
the
mingled
voices
of
the
bellowing
bawling
herd
with
now
and
then
the
shrill
piercing
yells
of
the
cowboys
could
be
heard
almost
as
far
when
this
part
of
the
work
was
over
some
of
the
riders
set
out
to
drive
the
cattle
selected
to
the
distant
home
ranch
corrals
while
others
of
the
company
remained
to
brand
the
calves
and
to
start
the
animals
that
were
to
have
their
freedom
until
the
next
rodeo
time
back
to
the
open
range
and
so
at
last
often
not
until
the
stars
were
out
the
riders
would
dismount
at
the
home
corrals
of
the
ranch
that
at
the
time
was
the
center
of
their
operations
or
perhaps
at
some
rodeo
camping
ground
at
supper
the
day
work
was
reviewed
with
many
a
laugh
and
jest
of
pointed
comment
and
then
those
whose
horses
needed
attention
because
of
saddle
sores
or
it
might
be
because
of
injuries
from
some
fall
on
the
rocks
busied
themselves
at
the
corral
while
others
met
for
a
friendly
game
of
cards
or
talked
and
yarned
over
restful
pipe
or
cigarette
and
then
bed
and
blankets
and
all
too
soon
the
reveille
sounded
by
the
beating
hoofs
of
the
saddle
band
as
the
wrangler
drove
them
in
announced
the
beginning
of
another
day
not
infrequently
there
were
accidents
from
falling
horses
from
angry
bulls
from
steers
or
excited
cows
or
perhaps
from
a
carelessly
handled
rope
in
some
critical
moment
horses
were
killed
men
with
broken
limbs
or
with
bodies
bruised
and
crushed
were
forced
to
drop
out
and
many
a
strong
horseman
who
rode
forth
in
the
morning
to
the
day
work
laughing
and
jesting
with
his
mates
had
been
borne
by
his
grave
and
silent
comrades
to
some
quiet
resting
place
to
await
in
long
and
dreamless
sleep
the
morning
of
that
last
great
rodeo
which
we
are
told
shall
gather
us
all
day
after
day
as
patches
rode
with
these
hardy
men
phil
watched
him
finding
himself
and
winning
his
place
among
the
cowboys
they
did
not
fail
as
they
said
to
try
him
out
nor
did
phil
in
these
trials
attempt
in
any
way
to
assist
his
pupil
but
the
men
learned
very
quickly
as
curly
had
learned
at
the
time
of
patches
introduction
that
while
the
new
man
was
always
ready
to
laugh
with
them
when
a
joke
was
turned
against
himself
there
was
a
line
beyond
which
it
was
not
well
to
go
in
the
work
he
was
of
course
assigned
only
to
such
parts
as
did
not
require
the
skill
and
knowledge
of
long
training
and
experience
but
he
did
all
that
was
given
him
to
do
with
such
readiness
and
skill
thanks
to
phil
teaching
that
the
men
wondered
and
this
together
with
his
evident
ability
in
the
art
of
defending
himself
and
the
story
of
his
strange
coming
to
the
caused
not
a
little
talk
with
many
and
varied
opinions
as
to
who
he
was
and
what
it
was
that
had
brought
him
among
them
strangely
enough
very
few
believed
that
patches
purpose
in
working
as
a
cowboy
for
the
dean
was
simply
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
they
felt
instinctively
as
in
fact
did
phil
and
the
dean
that
there
was
something
more
beneath
it
all
than
such
a
commonplace
nick
cambert
who
with
yavapai
joe
rode
in
the
rodeo
carefully
avoided
the
stranger
but
patches
by
his
persistent
friendly
interest
in
the
tailholt
mountain
man
follower
added
greatly
to
the
warmth
of
the
discussions
and
conjectures
regarding
himself
the
rodeo
had
reached
the
ranch
with
jim
reid
in
charge
when
the
incident
occurred
which
still
further
stimulated
the
various
opinions
and
suggestions
as
to
the
new
man
real
character
and
mission
they
were
working
the
cattle
that
day
on
the
rodeo
ground
just
outside
the
home
ranch
corral
phil
and
curly
were
cutting
out
some
steers
when
the
riders
who
were
holding
the
cattle
saw
them
separate
a
calf
from
the
herd
and
start
it
not
toward
the
cattle
they
had
already
cut
out
but
toward
the
corral
instantly
everybody
knew
what
had
happened
the
cowboy
nearest
the
gate
did
not
need
phil
word
to
open
it
for
his
neighbor
next
in
line
to
drive
the
calf
inside
not
a
word
was
said
until
the
calves
to
be
branded
were
also
driven
into
the
corral
then
phil
after
a
moment
talk
with
jim
reid
rode
up
to
nick
cambert
who
was
sitting
on
his
horse
a
little
apart
from
the
group
of
intensely
interested
cowboys
the
foreman
tone
was
curt
i
reckon
i
have
to
trouble
you
to
vent
your
brand
on
that
calf
nick
the
tailholt
mountain
man
made
no
shallow
pretense
that
he
did
not
understand
not
by
a
damn
sight
he
returned
roughly
i
ai
calves
for
bill
baldwin
an
i
happen
to
know
what
i
talkin
about
this
trip
that
a
calf
an
i
branded
him
myself
over
in
horse
wash
before
he
left
the
cow
some
of
your
punchers
are
too
damned
handy
with
their
runnin
irons
wild
horse
phil
for
a
moment
phil
looked
at
the
man
while
jim
reid
moved
his
horse
nearer
and
the
cowboys
waited
breathlessly
then
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
tailholt
mountain
man
face
phil
called
sharply
patches
come
here
there
was
a
sudden
movement
among
the
riders
and
a
subdued
murmur
as
patches
rode
forward
is
that
calf
you
told
me
about
in
the
corral
patches
asked
phil
when
the
man
was
beside
him
yes
sir
that
him
over
there
by
that
brindle
cow
patches
indicated
the
animal
in
question
and
you
put
our
iron
on
him
asked
phil
still
watching
nick
i
did
returned
patches
coolly
tell
us
about
it
directed
the
dean
foreman
and
patches
obeyed
briefly
it
was
that
day
you
sent
me
to
fix
the
fence
on
the
southwest
corner
of
the
big
pasture
i
saw
a
bunch
of
cattle
a
little
way
outside
the
fence
and
went
to
look
them
over
this
calf
was
following
a
cow
are
you
sure
yes
sir
i
watched
them
for
half
an
hour
what
was
in
the
bunch
four
steers
a
bull
five
cows
and
this
calf
there
were
three
cows
one
and
one
the
calf
went
to
the
cow
every
time
and
besides
he
is
marked
just
like
his
mother
i
saw
her
again
this
afternoon
while
we
were
working
the
cattle
phil
nodded
i
know
her
jim
reid
was
watching
patches
keenly
with
a
quiet
look
now
and
then
at
nick
the
cowboys
were
murmuring
among
themselves
pretty
good
work
for
a
tenderfoot
tenderfoot
hell
they
got
nick
this
trip
got
nothin
ca
you
see
it
a
phil
spoke
to
nick
well
are
satisfied
will
you
vent
your
brand
the
big
man
face
was
distorted
with
passion
vent
nothin
he
roared
on
the
word
of
a
damned
sneakin
tenderfoot
i
he
stopped
as
patches
before
phil
could
check
the
movement
pushed
close
to
his
side
in
the
sudden
stillness
the
new
man
cool
deliberate
voice
sounded
clearly
i
am
positive
that
you
made
a
mistake
when
you
put
your
iron
on
that
calf
cambert
and
he
added
slowly
as
though
with
the
kindest
possible
intention
i
am
sure
that
you
can
safely
take
my
word
for
it
without
further
question
for
a
moment
nick
glared
at
patches
speechless
then
to
the
amazement
of
every
cowboy
in
the
corral
the
big
man
mumbled
a
surly
something
and
took
down
his
riata
to
rope
the
calf
and
disclaim
his
ownership
of
the
animal
jim
reid
shook
his
head
in
puzzled
doubt
the
cowboys
were
clearly
divided
he
too
good
a
hand
for
a
tenderfoot
argued
one
carried
that
off
like
an
like
nick
to
lay
down
so
easy
for
anybody
added
another
nick
on
to
something
about
patches
that
we
ai
next
to
insisted
a
third
or
else
we
all
bein
strung
for
a
bunch
of
suckers
offered
still
another
you
boys
just
hold
your
horses
an
ride
easy
said
curly
my
still
on
honorable
patches
and
bob
added
his
loyal
support
with
his
cheerful
me
too
it
all
looked
straight
enough
jim
reid
admitted
to
the
dean
that
evening
but
i
ca
get
away
from
the
notion
that
there
was
some
sort
of
an
understanding
between
your
man
an
that
damned
tailholt
mountain
thief
it
looked
like
it
was
all
too
quiet
an
easy
somehow
like
it
had
been
planned
beforehand
the
dean
laughingly
told
his
neighbor
that
he
was
right
that
there
was
an
understanding
between
patches
and
nick
and
then
explained
by
relating
how
patches
had
met
the
tailholt
mountain
men
that
day
at
the
spring
when
the
dean
had
finished
the
big
cowman
asked
several
very
suggestive
questions
how
did
the
dean
know
that
patches
story
was
anything
more
than
a
cleverly
arranged
tale
invented
for
the
express
purpose
of
allaying
any
suspicion
as
to
his
true
relationship
with
nick
if
patches
character
was
so
far
above
suspicion
why
did
he
always
dodge
any
talk
that
might
touch
his
past
was
it
necessary
or
usual
for
men
to
keep
so
about
themselves
what
did
the
dean
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
really
know
about
this
man
who
had
appeared
so
strangely
from
nowhere
and
had
given
a
name
even
that
was
so
plainly
a
ridiculous
invention
the
dean
must
remember
that
the
suspicion
as
to
the
source
of
nick
too
rapidly
increasing
herds
had
so
far
been
directed
wholly
against
nick
himself
and
that
the
owner
of
the
iron
was
not
altogether
a
fool
it
was
quite
time
reid
argued
for
nick
to
cease
his
personal
activities
and
to
trust
the
actual
work
of
branding
to
some
confederate
whose
movements
would
not
be
so
closely
questioned
in
short
reid
had
been
expecting
some
stranger
to
seek
a
job
with
some
of
the
ranches
that
were
in
a
position
to
contribute
to
the
tailholt
mountain
outfit
and
for
his
part
he
would
await
developments
before
becoming
too
enthusiastic
over
honorable
patches
all
of
which
the
good
dean
found
very
hard
to
answer
but
look
here
jim
he
protested
do
you
go
makin
it
unpleasant
for
the
boy
whatever
you
think
you
do
know
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
if
we
guessin
on
one
side
you
guessin
on
the
other
i
admit
that
what
you
say
sounds
reasonable
but
hang
it
i
like
patches
as
for
his
name
well
we
did
use
to
go
so
much
on
names
in
this
country
you
know
the
boy
may
have
some
good
reason
for
not
about
himself
just
give
him
a
square
chance
do
put
no
burrs
under
his
saddle
blanket
that
all
i
askin
jim
laughed
the
speech
was
so
characteristic
of
the
dean
and
jim
reid
loved
his
old
friend
and
neighbor
as
all
men
did
for
being
as
was
commonly
said
so
easy
do
worry
will
he
answered
i
not
goin
to
start
anything
if
i
should
happen
to
be
right
about
mr
honorable
patches
he
exactly
where
we
want
him
i
propose
to
keep
my
eye
on
him
that
all
and
i
think
you
an
phil
had
better
do
the
same
chapter
xi
after
the
rodeo
as
the
fall
rodeo
swept
on
its
way
over
the
wide
ranges
the
last
reluctant
bits
of
summer
passed
and
hints
of
the
coming
winter
began
to
appear
the
yellow
glory
of
the
goldenrod
and
the
gorgeous
banks
of
color
on
sunflower
flats
faded
to
earthy
russet
and
brown
the
white
cups
of
the
jimson
weed
were
broken
and
lost
the
dainty
the
and
the
heavier
bladed
of
the
great
pasture
lands
were
dry
and
tawny
and
the
that
had
tufted
the
rolling
hills
with
brighter
green
at
the
touch
of
the
first
frost
turned
a
dull
and
somber
gray
while
the
varied
beauties
of
the
valley
meadows
became
even
as
the
dead
and
withered
leaves
of
the
walnut
trees
that
in
falling
left
the
widespread
limbs
and
branches
so
bare
then
the
rodeo
and
the
shipping
were
over
the
weeks
of
the
late
fall
range
riding
were
past
and
it
was
winter
from
skyline
to
skyline
the
world
was
white
save
for
the
dark
pines
upon
the
mountain
sides
the
brighter
cedars
and
junipers
upon
the
hills
and
ridges
and
the
living
green
of
the
oak
brush
that
when
all
else
was
covered
with
snow
gave
the
cattle
their
winter
feed
more
than
ever
now
with
the
passing
of
the
summer
and
fall
kitty
longed
for
the
stirring
life
that
in
some
measure
had
won
her
from
the
scenes
of
her
home
and
from
her
homeland
friends
the
young
friendship
with
patches
made
easy
by
the
fact
that
the
baldwins
had
taken
him
so
wholly
into
their
hearts
served
to
keep
alive
her
memories
of
that
world
to
which
she
was
sure
he
belonged
and
such
memories
did
not
tend
to
make
kitty
more
contented
and
happy
in
williamson
valley
toward
phil
kitty
was
unchanged
many
times
her
heart
called
for
him
so
insistently
that
she
wished
she
had
never
learned
to
know
any
life
other
than
that
life
to
which
they
had
both
been
born
if
only
she
had
not
spent
those
years
away
from
home
she
often
told
herself
it
would
all
have
been
so
different
she
could
have
been
happy
with
phil
very
happy
if
only
she
had
remained
in
his
world
but
now
now
she
was
afraid
afraid
for
him
as
well
as
for
herself
her
friendship
with
patches
had
in
so
many
ways
emphasized
the
things
that
stood
between
her
and
the
man
whom
had
it
not
been
for
her
education
she
would
have
accepted
so
gladly
as
her
mate
many
times
when
the
three
were
together
and
kitty
had
led
the
talk
far
from
the
life
with
which
the
cowboy
was
familiar
the
young
woman
was
forced
against
the
wish
of
her
heart
to
make
comparisons
kitty
did
not
understand
that
phil
unaccustomed
to
speaking
of
things
outside
his
work
and
the
life
interests
of
his
associates
and
timid
always
in
expressing
his
own
thoughts
found
it
very
hard
to
reveal
the
real
wealth
of
his
mind
to
her
when
she
assumed
so
readily
that
he
knew
nothing
beyond
his
horses
and
cattle
but
patches
to
whom
phil
had
learned
to
speak
with
little
reserve
understood
and
knowing
that
the
wall
which
the
girl
felt
separated
her
from
the
cowboy
was
built
almost
wholly
of
her
own
assumptions
patches
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
help
the
young
woman
to
a
fuller
acquaintance
with
the
man
whom
she
thought
she
had
known
since
childhood
during
the
long
winter
months
many
an
evening
at
the
at
the
reid
home
or
perhaps
at
some
neighborhood
party
or
dance
afforded
kitty
opportunities
for
a
fuller
understanding
of
phil
but
resulted
only
in
establishing
a
closer
friendship
with
patches
then
came
the
spring
the
snow
melted
the
rains
fell
the
washes
and
creek
channels
were
filled
with
roaring
floods
hill
and
ridge
and
mountain
slope
and
mesa
awoke
to
the
new
life
that
was
swelling
in
every
branch
and
leaf
and
blade
the
beauties
of
the
valley
meadow
appeared
again
in
fresh
and
fragrant
loveliness
while
from
and
bush
and
grassy
bank
and
tree
the
larks
and
mocking
birds
and
doves
voiced
their
glad
return
and
with
the
spring
came
a
guest
to
the
ranch
another
stranger
patches
had
been
riding
the
drift
fence
and
as
he
made
his
way
toward
the
home
ranch
in
the
late
afternoon
he
looked
a
very
different
man
from
the
patches
who
several
months
before
had
been
rescued
by
kitty
from
a
humiliating
experience
with
that
same
fence
the
fact
that
he
was
now
riding
stranger
the
big
bay
with
the
blazed
face
more
than
anything
else
perhaps
marked
the
change
that
had
come
to
the
man
whom
the
horse
had
so
viciously
tested
on
that
day
when
they
began
together
their
education
and
work
on
the
ranch
no
one
meeting
the
cowboy
who
handled
his
powerful
and
wild
spirited
mount
with
such
easy
confidence
and
skill
would
have
identified
him
with
the
gentleman
whom
phil
had
met
on
the
divide
the
months
of
active
outdoor
life
had
given
his
tall
body
a
lithe
and
supple
strength
that
was
revealed
in
his
every
movement
while
wind
and
sun
had
stained
his
skin
that
deep
tan
which
marks
those
who
must
face
the
elements
every
waking
hour
prom
tinkling
bridle
chain
and
jingling
spur
to
the
coiled
riata
his
equipment
showed
the
unmistakable
marks
of
use
his
fringed
chaps
shaped
by
many
a
day
in
the
saddle
to
his
long
legs
expressed
experience
while
his
broad
hat
soiled
by
sweat
and
dust
had
acquired
individuality
and
his
very
jumper
once
blue
but
now
faded
and
patched
disclaimed
the
tenderfoot
riding
for
a
little
way
along
the
top
of
the
ridge
that
forms
the
western
edge
of
the
valley
patches
looked
down
upon
the
red
roofs
of
the
buildings
of
the
home
ranch
and
smiled
as
he
thought
of
the
welcome
that
awaited
him
there
at
the
close
of
his
day
work
the
dean
and
stella
with
little
billy
and
phil
and
the
others
of
the
home
circle
had
grown
very
dear
to
this
strong
man
of
whom
they
still
knew
nothing
and
great
as
was
the
change
in
his
outward
appearance
and
manner
the
man
himself
knew
that
there
were
other
changes
as
great
honorable
patches
had
not
only
acquired
a
name
and
a
profession
but
in
acquiring
them
he
had
gained
something
of
much
greater
worth
to
himself
and
so
he
was
grateful
to
those
who
taking
him
on
trust
had
helped
him
more
than
they
knew
he
had
left
the
ridge
and
was
half
way
across
the
flat
toward
the
corrals
when
little
billy
spurring
old
sheep
in
desperate
energy
rode
wildly
out
to
meet
him
as
the
lad
approached
he
greeted
his
big
friend
with
shrill
boyish
shouts
and
patches
answered
with
a
cowboy
yell
which
did
credit
to
his
training
while
stranger
with
a
wild
preliminary
bound
into
the
air
proceeded
with
many
weird
contortions
to
give
an
exhibition
which
fairly
expressed
his
sentiments
little
billy
grinned
with
delight
yip
yip
he
shrilled
for
stranger
benefit
and
then
as
the
big
horse
continued
his
manifestations
the
lad
added
the
cowboy
encouraging
admonition
to
the
rider
stay
with
him
patches
stay
with
him
patches
laughingly
stayed
with
him
what
you
aimin
to
do
pardner
he
asked
when
stranger
at
last
consented
to
keep
two
feet
on
the
ground
at
the
same
time
tryin
to
get
me
piled
shucks
retorted
the
youngster
admiringly
i
do
reckon
anything
could
pile
you
i
come
out
to
tell
you
that
we
got
company
he
added
as
side
by
side
they
rode
on
toward
the
corrals
patches
was
properly
surprised
company
he
exclaimed
little
billy
grinned
proudly
yep
he
a
man
from
way
back
east
somewhere
uncle
will
brought
him
out
from
town
they
got
here
just
after
dinner
i
do
guess
he
ever
seen
a
ranch
before
gee
but
wo
we
have
fun
with
him
patches
face
was
grave
as
he
listened
how
do
you
know
he
is
from
the
east
billy
he
asked
concealing
his
anxious
interest
with
a
smile
at
his
little
comrade
heard
uncle
will
tell
phil
and
kitty
oh
kitty
is
at
the
house
too
is
she
billy
giggled
she
an
phil
been
off
somewheres
ridin
together
most
all
day
they
just
got
back
a
while
ago
they
was
talkin
with
the
company
when
i
left
phil
saw
you
when
you
was
back
there
on
the
ridge
an
i
come
on
out
to
tell
you
phil
and
kitty
were
walking
toward
their
horses
which
were
standing
near
the
corral
fence
as
patches
and
little
billy
came
through
the
gate
the
boy
dropped
from
his
saddle
and
ran
on
into
the
house
to
tell
his
aunt
stella
that
patches
had
come
leaving
sheep
to
be
looked
after
by
whoever
volunteered
for
the
service
it
was
one
of
little
humiliations
that
he
was
not
yet
tall
enough
to
saddle
or
bridle
his
own
horse
and
the
men
tactfully
saw
to
it
that
his
mount
was
always
ready
in
the
morning
and
properly
released
at
night
without
any
embarrassing
comments
on
the
subject
patches
checked
his
horse
and
without
dismounting
greeted
his
friends
you
not
going
he
said
to
kitty
with
a
note
of
protest
in
his
voice
i
have
seen
you
for
a
week
it
not
fair
for
phil
to
take
advantage
of
his
position
and
send
me
off
somewhere
alone
while
he
spends
his
time
riding
over
the
country
with
you
they
laughed
up
at
him
as
he
sat
there
on
the
big
bay
hat
in
hand
looking
down
into
their
upturned
faces
with
the
intimate
friendly
interest
of
an
older
brother
patches
noticed
that
kitty
eyes
were
bright
with
excitement
and
that
phil
were
twinkling
with
suppressed
merriment
i
must
go
patches
said
the
young
woman
i
ought
to
have
gone
two
hours
ago
but
i
was
so
interested
that
the
time
slipped
away
before
i
realized
we
have
company
explained
phil
looking
at
patches
and
deliberately
closing
one
eye
the
one
that
kitty
could
not
see
a
distinguished
guest
if
you
please
i
loan
you
a
clean
shirt
for
supper
that
is
if
mother
lets
you
eat
at
the
same
table
with
him
phil
how
can
you
protested
kitty
the
two
men
laughed
but
phil
fancied
that
there
was
a
hint
of
anxiety
in
patches
face
as
the
man
on
the
horse
said
little
billy
broke
the
news
to
me
who
is
he
a
friend
of
judge
morris
in
prescott
answered
phil
the
judge
asked
uncle
will
to
take
him
on
the
ranch
for
a
while
he
and
the
judge
were
kitty
interrupted
with
enthusiasm
it
is
professor
parkhill
patches
the
famous
professor
of
aesthetics
you
know
everard
charles
parkhill
and
he
going
to
spend
the
summer
in
williamson
valley
is
it
wonderful
phil
saw
a
look
of
relief
in
his
friend
face
as
patches
answered
kitty
with
sympathetic
interest
it
certainly
will
be
a
great
pleasure
miss
reid
especially
for
you
to
have
one
so
distinguished
for
his
scholarship
in
the
neighborhood
is
professor
parkhill
visiting
arizona
for
his
health
something
in
patches
voice
caused
phil
to
turn
hastily
aside
but
kitty
who
was
thinking
how
perfectly
patches
understood
her
noticed
nothing
in
his
grave
tones
save
his
usual
courteous
deference
partly
because
of
his
health
she
answered
but
he
is
going
to
prepare
a
series
of
lectures
i
understand
he
says
that
in
the
crude
and
uncultivated
mentalities
of
our
here
he
is
now
interrupted
phil
as
the
distinguished
guest
of
the
appeared
coming
slowly
toward
them
professor
everard
charles
parkhill
looked
the
part
to
which
from
his
birth
he
had
been
assigned
by
his
parents
his
slender
body
with
its
narrow
shoulders
and
sunken
chest
frail
as
it
was
seemed
almost
too
heavy
for
his
feeble
legs
his
thin
face
bloodless
and
sallow
with
a
sparse
daintily
trimmed
beard
and
weak
watery
eyes
was
characterized
by
a
solemn
and
portentous
gravity
as
though
realizing
fully
the
profound
importance
of
his
mission
in
life
he
could
permit
no
trivial
thought
to
enter
his
bald
domelike
head
one
knew
instinctively
that
in
all
the
or
fifty
years
of
his
little
life
no
happiness
or
joy
that
had
not
been
scientifically
sterilized
and
certified
had
ever
been
permitted
to
stain
his
soul
as
he
came
forward
he
gazed
at
the
man
on
the
big
bay
horse
with
a
curious
eagerness
as
though
he
were
considering
a
strange
and
interesting
creature
that
could
scarcely
be
held
to
belong
to
the
human
race
professor
parkhill
said
phil
coolly
you
were
saying
that
you
had
never
seen
a
genuine
cowboy
in
his
native
haunt
permit
me
to
introduce
a
typical
specimen
mr
honorable
patches
patches
this
is
professor
parkhill
phil
murmured
kitty
how
can
you
the
professor
was
gazing
at
patches
as
though
fascinated
and
patches
his
face
as
grave
as
the
face
of
a
wooden
indian
stared
back
at
the
professor
with
a
blank
and
expression
of
rustic
wonder
that
convulsed
phil
and
made
kitty
turn
away
to
hide
a
smile
howdy
proud
to
meet
up
with
you
mister
drawled
the
typical
specimen
of
the
genus
cowboy
and
then
as
though
suddenly
remembering
his
manners
he
leaped
to
the
ground
and
strode
awkwardly
forward
one
hand
outstretched
in
greeting
the
other
holding
fast
to
stranger
bridle
rein
while
the
horse
danced
and
plunged
about
with
reckless
indifference
to
the
polite
intentions
of
his
master
the
professor
backed
fearfully
away
from
the
dangerous
looking
horse
and
the
equally
cowboy
whereat
patches
addressed
stranger
with
a
roar
of
savage
wrath
whoa
you
consarned
you
whoa
i
tell
you
cai
you
see
to
shake
hands
with
this
here
man
what
the
boss
has
interduced
me
to
phil
nearly
choked
kitty
was
looking
unutterable
things
they
did
not
know
that
patches
was
suffering
from
a
reaction
caused
by
the
discovery
that
he
had
never
before
met
professor
parkhill
you
see
mister
he
explained
gravely
advancing
again
with
stranger
following
nervously
this
here
fool
horse
ai
used
to
strangers
no
how
them
as
do
look
as
you
might
say
just
natural
like
he
finished
with
a
sheepish
grin
as
he
grasped
the
soft
little
hand
and
pumped
it
up
and
down
with
virile
energy
then
staring
with
bucolic
wonder
at
the
distinguished
representative
of
the
highest
culture
he
asked
be
you
an
professor
heard
about
such
but
i
ai
never
seen
one
before
the
little
man
replied
hurriedly
but
with
timid
pride
certainly
sir
yes
certainly
you
be
exclaimed
the
cowboy
as
though
overcome
by
his
nearness
to
such
dignity
excuse
me
askin
but
if
you
do
mind
now
what
be
you
professor
of
the
other
answered
with
more
courage
as
though
his
soul
found
strength
in
the
very
word
aesthetics
the
cowboy
jaw
dropped
his
mouth
opened
in
gaping
awe
and
he
looked
from
the
professor
to
phil
and
kitty
as
if
silently
appealing
to
them
to
verify
this
startling
thing
which
he
had
heard
you
do
say
he
murmured
at
last
in
innocent
admiration
well
now
to
think
of
a
little
feller
like
you
all
that
but
jest
what
be
them
there
esteticks
what
you
professor
of
if
you
do
mind
my
askin
the
distinguished
scholar
answered
promptly
in
his
best
platform
voice
the
science
or
doctrine
of
the
nature
of
beauty
and
of
judgments
of
tastes
at
this
stranger
with
a
snort
of
fear
stood
straight
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
professor
parkhill
scuttled
to
a
position
of
safety
behind
phil
excuse
me
folks
said
patches
i
just
naturally
obliged
to
to
this
here
thing
what
thinks
he
a
hoss
come
along
you
ornery
excuse
you
you
ai
got
no
more
manners
a
measly
coyote
the
famous
professor
of
aesthetics
stood
with
phil
and
kitty
watching
patches
as
that
gentleman
relieved
the
dancing
bay
of
the
saddle
and
led
him
away
through
the
corrals
to
the
gate
leading
into
the
meadow
pasture
i
beg
pardon
murmured
the
visitor
in
his
thin
little
voice
but
what
did
i
understand
you
to
say
is
the
fellow
name
patches
honorable
patches
answered
phil
how
strange
how
extraordinarily
strange
i
should
be
very
interested
to
know
something
of
his
ancestry
and
if
possible
to
trace
the
origin
of
such
a
peculiar
name
phil
replied
with
exaggerated
concern
for
heaven
sake
sir
say
anything
about
the
man
name
in
his
hearing
he
he
is
dangerous
you
mean
he
is
if
he
thinks
anyone
is
making
light
of
his
name
you
should
ask
some
of
the
boys
who
have
tried
it
but
i
i
assure
you
acton
i
had
no
thought
of
ridicule
far
from
it
oh
very
far
from
it
kitty
was
obliged
to
turn
away
she
arrived
at
the
corral
in
time
to
meet
patches
who
was
returning
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
she
scolded
but
in
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
were
laughing
yes
said
patches
meekly
hat
in
hand
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
she
demanded
how
could
i
help
doing
it
how
could
you
help
it
yes
you
saw
how
he
looked
at
me
really
miss
reid
i
could
bear
to
disappoint
him
so
cruelly
honestly
now
was
i
exactly
what
he
expected
me
to
be
i
think
you
should
compliment
me
did
i
do
it
very
well
but
he
think
you
nothing
but
a
cowboy
she
protested
fine
retorted
patches
quickly
i
thank
you
miss
reid
that
is
really
the
most
satisfactory
compliment
i
have
ever
received
you
mocking
me
now
said
kitty
puzzled
by
his
manner
indeed
i
am
not
i
am
very
serious
he
returned
but
here
he
comes
again
with
your
gracious
permission
i
make
my
exit
please
explain
to
the
professor
it
would
humiliate
me
and
think
how
it
would
shock
and
disappoint
him
lifting
his
saddle
from
the
ground
and
starting
toward
the
shed
he
said
in
a
louder
tone
sure
i
wo
ferget
miss
kitty
an
you
kin
tell
your
paw
that
there
baldfaced
steer
o
what
give
us
the
slip
last
rodeo
time
is
over
in
our
big
pasture
i
sure
seen
him
thar
during
the
days
immediately
following
that
first
meeting
kitty
passed
many
hours
with
professor
parkhill
phil
and
his
cowboys
were
busy
preparing
for
the
spring
rodeo
baldwin
was
wholly
occupied
with
ministering
to
the
animal
comforts
of
her
earthly
household
and
the
dean
always
courteous
and
kind
to
his
guest
managed
nevertheless
to
think
of
some
pressing
business
that
demanded
his
immediate
and
personal
attention
whenever
the
visitor
sought
to
engage
him
in
conversation
the
professor
quite
naturally
holding
the
cattleman
to
be
but
a
rude
illiterate
and
wholly
materialistic
creature
but
little
superior
in
intellectual
and
spiritual
powers
to
his
own
beasts
sought
merely
to
investigate
the
dean
mental
works
with
as
little
regard
for
the
dean
feelings
as
a
biologist
would
show
toward
a
hug
the
dean
confided
to
phil
and
patches
one
day
when
he
had
escaped
to
the
blacksmith
shop
where
the
men
were
shoeing
their
horses
that
the
professor
was
harmlessly
insane
just
think
he
exploded
of
the
poor
little
fool
livin
in
chicago
for
three
years
an
never
once
goin
out
to
the
stockyards
even
it
remained
therefore
for
kitty
the
only
worshiper
of
the
gods
in
williamson
valley
to
supply
that
companionship
which
seems
so
necessary
even
to
those
whose
souls
are
so
far
removed
from
material
wants
in
short
as
little
billy
put
it
with
a
boy
irreverence
kitty
rode
herd
on
the
professor
and
strangely
enough
to
them
all
kitty
seemed
to
like
the
job
either
because
her
friendship
with
patches
which
had
some
to
mean
a
great
deal
to
kitty
outweighed
her
respect
and
admiration
for
the
distinguished
object
of
his
fun
or
because
she
waited
for
some
opportunity
to
make
the
revelation
a
punishment
to
the
offender
the
young
woman
did
not
betray
the
real
character
of
the
cowboy
to
the
stranger
and
the
professor
thanks
to
phil
warning
not
only
refrained
from
investigating
the
name
of
patches
but
carefully
avoided
patches
himself
in
the
meantime
the
typical
specimen
was
forced
to
take
a
small
part
in
the
table
talk
lest
he
betray
himself
so
marked
was
this
that
baldwin
one
day
not
understanding
openly
chided
him
for
being
so
glum
whereupon
the
dean
to
whom
phil
had
thoughtfully
explained
teased
the
deceiver
unmercifully
with
many
laughingly
alleged
reasons
for
his
grouch
while
curly
and
bob
attributing
their
comrade
manner
to
the
embarrassing
presence
of
the
stranger
grinned
sympathetically
and
the
professor
himself
unconsciously
agreeing
with
the
cowboys
with
kindly
condescension
tried
to
make
the
victim
of
his
august
superiority
as
much
at
ease
as
possible
which
naturally
for
the
dean
and
phil
added
not
a
little
to
the
situation
then
the
spring
rodeo
took
the
men
far
from
the
home
ranch
and
for
several
weeks
the
distinguished
guest
of
the
was
left
almost
wholly
to
the
guardianship
of
the
young
woman
who
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
meadows
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
rodeo
when
phil
rode
to
the
home
ranch
late
in
the
afternoon
to
consult
with
the
dean
about
the
shipping
patches
and
the
cowboys
who
were
to
help
in
the
long
drive
to
the
railroad
were
at
toohey
with
the
cattle
while
the
cowboys
were
finishing
their
early
breakfast
the
next
morning
the
foreman
returned
and
patches
knew
almost
before
phil
spoke
that
something
had
happened
they
shouted
their
greetings
as
he
approached
but
he
had
no
smile
for
their
cheery
reception
nor
did
he
answer
even
until
he
had
ridden
close
to
the
group
about
the
camp
fire
then
with
a
short
mornin
boys
he
dismounted
and
stood
with
the
bridle
reins
in
his
hand
at
his
manner
a
hush
fell
over
the
little
company
and
they
watched
him
curiously
no
breakfast
sam
he
said
shortly
to
the
chinaman
just
a
cup
of
coffee
then
to
the
cowboys
you
fellows
saddle
up
and
get
that
bunch
of
cattle
to
moving
we
load
at
skull
valley
sam
brought
his
coffee
and
he
drank
it
as
he
stood
while
the
men
hurriedly
departed
for
their
horses
patches
the
last
to
go
paused
a
moment
as
though
to
speak
but
phil
prevented
him
with
a
gruff
order
get
a
move
on
you
patches
those
cars
will
be
there
long
before
we
are
and
patches
seeing
the
man
face
dark
and
drawn
with
pain
moved
away
without
a
word
great
snakes
softly
ejaculated
curly
a
few
moments
later
as
patches
stooped
to
take
his
saddle
from
where
it
lay
on
the
ground
beside
curly
what
do
you
reckon
eatin
the
boss
him
an
the
dean
could
mixed
it
last
night
could
they
do
you
reckon
the
dean
crawled
him
about
somethin
patches
shook
his
head
with
a
search
me
pardner
as
he
turned
to
his
horse
somethin
happened
sure
muttered
the
other
busy
with
his
saddle
blanket
sufferin
cats
but
i
felt
like
he
poured
a
bucket
of
ice
water
down
my
neck
he
drew
the
cinch
tight
with
a
vigorous
jerk
that
brought
a
grunt
of
protest
from
his
mount
that
right
he
continued
addressing
the
horse
hump
yourself
an
swell
up
and
grunt
damn
you
you
ought
to
be
thankin
god
that
you
ai
nothin
but
a
hoss
nohow
with
no
feelin
what
in
your
belly
he
dropped
the
heavy
stirrup
with
a
vicious
slap
and
swung
to
his
seat
if
phil
to
keep
up
the
way
he
startin
we
sure
have
a
pleasant
little
ride
to
skull

oh

but
i
wisht
i
was
a
professor
of
them
there
exteticks
or
somethin
nice
and
gentle
like
jest
for
anyhow
patches
laughed
think
you
could
qualify
curly
the
cowboy
grinned
as
they
rode
off
together
so
far
as
i
noticed
the
main
part
of
the
work
i
could
the
shade
of
them
walnut
trees
at
the
home
ranch
or
the
front
porch
an
a
nice
easy
chair
with
fat
cushions
or
mebby
the
buckboard
onct
in
a
while
with
kitty
to
do
the
drivin
say
this
has
sure
been
some
little
ol
rodeo
ai
it
i
ai
got
a
hoss
in
my
string
that
can
stand
up
honest
to
god
patches
i
jest
corns
all
over
how
your
saddle
feel
this
mornin
it
got
corns
too
admitted
patches
but
there
phil
we
better
be
riding
all
that
day
phil
kept
to
himself
speaking
to
his
companions
only
when
speech
could
not
be
avoided
and
then
with
the
fewest
possible
words
that
night
he
left
the
company
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
supper
and
went
off
somewhere
alone
and
patches
heard
him
finding
his
bed
long
after
the
other
members
of
the
outfit
were
sound
asleep
and
the
following
day
through
the
trying
work
of
loading
the
cattle
the
young
foreman
was
so
little
like
himself
that
had
it
not
been
that
his
men
were
nearly
all
boyhood
friends
who
had
known
him
all
his
life
there
would
surely
have
been
a
mutiny
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
last
reluctant
steer
was
prodded
and
pushed
up
the
timbered
runway
from
the
pens
and
crowded
into
the
car
curly
and
bob
were
going
with
the
cattle
train
the
others
would
remain
at
skull
valley
until
morning
when
they
would
start
for
their
widely
separated
homes
phil
announced
that
he
was
going
to
the
home
ranch
that
night
you
can
make
it
home
sometime
patches
he
finished
when
he
had
said
to
the
little
group
of
men
with
whom
he
had
lived
and
worked
in
closest
intimacy
through
the
long
weeks
of
the
rodeo
he
reined
his
horse
about
even
as
he
spoke
to
set
out
on
his
long
ride
the
foreman
was
beyond
hearing
of
the
cowboys
when
patches
overtook
him
do
you
mind
if
i
go
back
to
the
with
you
phil
the
cowboy
asked
quietly
phil
checked
his
horse
and
looked
at
his
friend
a
moment
without
answering
then
in
a
kindlier
tone
than
he
had
used
the
past
two
days
he
said
you
better
stay
here
with
the
boys
and
get
your
night
rest
patches
you
have
had
a
long
hard
spell
of
it
in
this
rodeo
and
yesterday
and
have
not
been
exactly
easy
shipping
is
always
hell
even
when
everybody
is
in
a
good
humor
he
smiled
grimly
if
you
do
not
object
i
would
really
like
to
go
said
patches
simply
but
your
horse
is
as
tired
as
you
ought
to
be
protested
phil
i
riding
stranger
you
know
the
other
answered
to
which
phil
replied
tersely
let
be
riding
then
the
cowboys
who
had
been
watching
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
as
phil
and
patches
rode
away
together
well
what
do
you
make
of
that
exclaimed
one
looks
like
honorable
patches
was
next
commented
another
us
ai
in
it
when
it
comes
to
associatin
with
the
boss
offered
a
third
you
shut
up
on
that
line
came
sharply
from
curly
phil
ai
us
down
for
nobody
i
reckon
if
patches
is
fool
enough
to
want
to
ride
to
the
phil
ai
got
no
reason
for
him
if
any
of
you
punchers
wants
to
make
the
ride
the
way
open
ai
it
now
do
you
go
on
the
prod
too
soothed
the
other
we
meanin
nothin
agin
phil
well
what
the
matter
with
patches
demanded
the
man
whose
heart
was
sorely
troubled
by
the
mystery
of
his
foreman
mood
ai
nobody
as
there
was
anything
the
matter
fact
is
nobody
that
there
is
and
for
some
reason
curly
had
no
answer
do
it
jest
naturally
beat
thunder
the
way
he
cottoned
up
to
that
yellow
dog
of
a
yavapai
joe
mused
another
encouraged
by
silence
three
or
four
of
the
boys
told
how
they
seen
together
off
an
on
but
i
did
think
nothin
of
it
until
i
seen
myself
when
we
was
workin
over
at
tailholt
it
was
one
evenin
after
supper
i
went
down
to
the
corral
to
fix
up
that
pedro
horse
back
when
i
heard
voices
kind
o
low
like
i
stopped
a
minute
an
then
sort
o
eased
along
in
the
dark
an
run
right
onto
where
they
was
in
the
door
o
the
saddle
room
cozy
as
you
please
yavapai
sneaked
away
while
i
was
gettin
the
lantern
an
lightin
it
but
patches
he
jest
stayed
an
held
the
light
for
me
while
i
fixed
ol
pedro
jest
as
if
nothin
had
happened
well
said
curly
sarcastically
what
happened
i
do
mebby
if
patches
was
what
some
o
you
boys
seem
to
think
do
you
reckon
be
for
the
demanded
curly
he
might
an
he
might
retorted
two
or
three
at
once
nobody
ca
say
nothin
in
a
case
like
that
until
the
added
one
i
do
reckon
the
dean
knows
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
unless
patches
is
what
some
of
the
other
boys
are
guessin
said
another
which
means
finished
curly
in
a
tone
of
disgust
that
we
got
to
millin
the
same
old
ring
again
come
on
bob
let
see
what
they
got
for
supper
that
engine
happen
along
directly
an
be
startin
hungry
phil
acton
was
not
ignorant
of
the
different
opinions
that
were
held
by
the
cattlemen
regarding
honorable
patches
nor
as
the
responsible
foreman
of
the
could
he
remain
indifferent
to
them
during
those
first
months
of
patches
life
on
the
ranch
when
the
cowboy
heart
had
so
often
been
moved
to
pity
for
the
stranger
who
had
come
to
them
apparently
from
some
painful
crisis
in
his
life
he
had
laughed
at
the
suspicions
of
his
old
friends
and
associates
but
as
the
months
had
passed
and
patches
had
so
rapidly
developed
into
a
strong
man
with
a
spirit
of
bold
recklessness
that
was
marked
even
among
those
hardy
riders
of
the
range
phil
forgot
in
a
measure
those
characteristics
that
the
stranger
had
shown
at
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
at
the
same
time
the
persistent
suspicions
of
the
cattlemen
together
with
patches
curious
and
in
a
way
secret
interest
in
yavapai
joe
could
not
but
have
a
decided
influence
upon
the
young
man
who
was
responsible
for
the
dean
property
it
was
inevitable
under
the
circumstances
that
phil
attitude
toward
patches
should
change
even
as
the
character
of
patches
himself
had
changed
while
the
foreman
manner
of
friendship
and
kindly
regard
remained
so
far
unaltered
and
while
phil
still
in
his
heart
believed
in
his
friend
and
as
he
would
have
said
would
continue
to
back
his
judgment
until
the
nevertheless
that
spirit
of
intimacy
which
had
so
marked
those
first
days
of
their
work
together
had
gradually
been
lost
to
them
the
cowboy
no
longer
talked
to
his
companion
as
he
had
talked
that
day
when
they
lay
in
the
shade
of
the
walnut
tree
at
toohey
and
during
the
following
days
of
their
range
riding
he
no
longer
admitted
his
friend
into
his
inner
life
as
he
had
done
that
day
when
he
told
patches
the
story
of
the
wild
stallion
and
patches
feeling
the
change
and
unable
to
understand
the
reason
for
it
waited
patiently
for
the
time
when
the
cloud
that
had
fallen
between
them
should
lift
so
they
rode
together
that
night
homeward
bound
at
the
end
of
the
long
hard
weeks
of
the
rodeo
in
the
deepening
gloom
of
the
passing
in
the
hushed
stillness
of
the
wild
land
under
the
wide
sky
where
the
starry
sentinel
hosts
were
gathering
for
their
watch
and
as
they
rode
their
stirrups
often
touching
each
was
alone
with
his
own
thoughts
phil
still
in
the
depth
of
his
somber
mood
brooded
over
his
bitter
trouble
patches
sympathetically
wondering
silently
questioning
wished
that
he
could
help
there
are
times
when
a
man
very
soul
forces
him
to
seek
companionship
alone
in
the
night
with
this
man
for
whom
even
at
that
first
moment
of
their
meeting
on
the
divide
he
had
felt
a
strange
sense
of
kinship
phil
found
himself
drifting
far
from
the
questions
that
had
risen
to
mar
the
closeness
of
their
intimacy
the
work
of
the
rodeo
was
over
his
cowboy
associates
with
their
suggestive
talk
were
far
away
under
the
influence
of
the
long
dark
miles
of
that
night
and
the
silent
presence
of
his
companion
the
young
man
for
the
time
being
was
no
longer
the
responsible
foreman
of
the
ranch
in
all
that
vast
and
silent
world
there
was
for
phil
acton
only
himself
his
trouble
and
his
friend
and
so
it
came
about
that
little
by
little
the
young
man
told
patches
the
story
of
his
dream
and
of
how
it
was
now
shattered
and
broken
sometimes
bitterly
as
though
he
felt
injustice
sometimes
harshly
as
though
in
contempt
for
some
weakness
of
his
own
with
sentences
broken
by
the
pain
he
strove
to
subdue
with
halting
words
and
long
silences
phil
told
of
his
plans
for
rebuilding
the
home
of
his
boyhood
and
of
restoring
the
business
that
through
the
generosity
of
his
father
had
been
lost
of
how
since
his
childhood
almost
he
had
worked
and
saved
to
that
end
and
of
his
love
for
kitty
which
had
been
the
very
light
of
his
dream
and
without
which
for
him
there
was
no
purpose
in
dreaming
and
the
man
who
rode
so
close
beside
him
listened
with
a
fuller
understanding
and
a
deeper
sympathy
than
phil
knew
and
now
said
phil
hopelessly
it
all
over
i
sure
come
to
the
end
of
my
string
reid
has
put
the
outfit
on
the
market
he
going
to
sell
out
and
quit
uncle
will
told
me
night
before
last
when
i
went
home
to
see
about
the
shipping
reid
is
going
to
sell
exclaimed
patches
and
there
was
a
curious
note
of
exultation
in
his
voice
which
phil
did
not
hear
neither
did
phil
see
that
his
companion
was
smiling
to
himself
under
cover
of
the
darkness
it
that
damned
professor
parkhill
that
brought
it
about
continued
the
cowboy
bitterly
ever
since
kitty
came
home
from
the
east
she
has
been
discontented
and
dissatisfied
with
ranch
life
i
was
all
right
when
she
went
away
but
when
she
came
back
she
discovered
that
i
was
nothing
but
a
she
has
been
fair
though
she
has
tried
to
get
back
where
she
was
before
she
left
and
i
thought
i
would
win
her
again
in
time
i
was
so
sure
of
it
that
it
never
troubled
me
you
have
seen
how
it
was
and
you
have
seen
how
she
was
always
wanting
the
life
that
she
had
learned
to
want
while
she
was
away
the
life
that
you
came
from
patches
i
have
been
mighty
glad
for
your
friendship
with
her
too
because
i
thought
she
would
learn
from
you
that
a
man
could
have
all
that
is
worth
having
in
life
and
still
be
happy
and
contented
and
she
would
have
learned
i
am
sure
she
could
help
seeing
it
but
now
that
damned
fool
who
knows
no
more
of
real
manhood
than
i
do
of
his
profession
has
spoiled
it
all
but
phil
i
do
understand
what
has
parkhill
to
do
with
selling
out
why
do
you
see
phil
returned
savagely
he
the
supreme
representative
of
the
highest
highbrowed
culture
is
he
he
a
lord
high
admiral
duke
or
potentate
of
some
sort
in
the
world
of
loftiest
thought
is
he
he
lives
moves
and
has
his
being
in
the
lofty
realms
of
the
purely
spiritual
does
he
he
cultured
and
cultivated
and
spiritualized
until
he
vibrates
nothing
but
pure
soul
whatever
that
means
and
he
refined
himself
and
himself
and
himself
until
there
not
an
ounce
of
red
blood
left
in
his
carcass
get
him
between
you
and
the
sun
after
what
he
calls
a
dinner
and
you
can
see
every
material
mouthful
that
he
has
disgraced
himself
by
swallowing
he
not
human
i
tell
you
he
only
a
kind
of
a
and
ought
to
be
fed
on
sterilized
moonbeams
and
pasteurized
starlight
amen
said
patches
solemnly
when
phil
paused
for
lack
of
breath
but
phil
your
eloquent
characterization
does
not
explain
what
the
has
to
do
with
the
sale
of
the
outfit
phil
voice
again
dropped
into
its
hopeless
key
as
he
answered
you
remember
how
from
the
very
first
kitty
well
sort
of
worshiped
him
do
you
you
mean
how
she
worshiped
his
aesthetic
cult
do
you
corrected
patches
quietly
i
suppose
that
it
responded
phil
gloomily
well
uncle
will
says
that
they
have
been
together
mighty
near
every
day
for
the
past
three
months
and
that
about
half
of
the
time
they
have
been
over
at
home
he
has
discovered
he
says
that
kitty
possesses
a
rare
and
wonderful
capacity
for
absorbing
the
higher
truths
of
the
more
purely
intellectual
and
spiritual
planes
of
life
and
that
she
has
a
marvelously
developed
appreciation
of
those
ideals
of
life
which
are
so
far
removed
from
the
base
and
material
interests
and
passions
which
belong
to
the
mere
animal
existence
of
the
common
herd
oh
hell
groaned
patches
well
that
what
he
told
uncle
will
returned
phil
stoutly
and
he
has
harped
on
that
string
so
long
and
yammered
so
much
to
jim
and
to
kitty
mother
about
the
girl
wonderful
intellectuality
and
what
a
career
she
would
have
if
only
she
had
the
opportunity
and
what
a
shame
and
a
loss
to
the
world
it
is
for
her
to
remain
buried
in
these
surroundings
that
they
have
got
to
believing
it
themselves
you
see
kitty
herself
has
in
a
way
been
getting
them
used
to
the
idea
that
williamson
valley
is
much
of
a
place
and
that
the
cow
business
does
rank
very
high
among
the
best
people
so
jim
is
going
to
sell
out
and
move
away
somewhere
where
kitty
can
have
her
career
and
the
boys
can
grow
up
to
be
something
better
than
like
you
and
me
jim
is
able
to
retire
anyway
thanks
phil
said
patches
quietly
what
for
why
for
including
me
in
your
class
i
consider
it
a
compliment
and
he
added
with
a
touch
of
his
old
humor
i
think
i
know
what
i
am
saying
better
perhaps
than
the
knows
what
he
talks
about
it
may
be
that
you
do
returned
phil
wearily
but
you
can
see
where
it
all
puts
me
the
professor
has
sure
got
me
down
and
so
tight
that
i
ca
even
think
perhaps
and
again
perhaps
not
returned
patches
reid
has
found
a
buyer
for
the
outfit
yet
has
he
not
yet
but
they
come
along
fast
enough
the
ranch
is
too
well
known
for
the
sale
to
hang
fire
long
the
next
day
phil
seemed
to
slip
back
again
in
his
attitude
toward
patches
to
the
temper
of
those
last
weeks
of
the
rodeo
it
was
as
though
the
young
man
with
his
return
to
the
home
ranch
and
to
the
dean
and
their
talks
and
plans
for
the
work
again
put
himself
his
personal
convictions
and
his
peculiar
regard
for
patches
aside
and
became
the
unprejudiced
foreman
careful
for
his
employer
interests
patches
very
quickly
but
without
offense
found
that
the
door
which
his
friend
had
opened
in
the
long
dark
hours
of
that
lonely
night
ride
had
closed
again
and
thinking
that
he
understood
he
made
no
attempt
to
force
his
way
but
for
some
reason
patches
appeared
to
be
in
an
unusually
happy
frame
of
mind
and
went
singing
and
whistling
about
the
corrals
and
buildings
as
though
exceedingly
well
pleased
with
himself
and
with
the
world
the
following
day
was
sunday
in
the
afternoon
patches
was
roaming
about
the
premises
keeping
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
walnut
trees
in
front
of
the
house
where
the
professor
had
cornered
the
dean
thus
punishing
both
patches
and
his
employer
by
preventing
one
of
their
long
sunday
talks
which
they
both
so
much
enjoyed
phil
had
gone
off
somewhere
to
be
alone
and
baldwin
was
reading
aloud
to
little
billy
honorable
patches
was
left
very
much
to
himself
from
the
top
of
the
little
hill
near
the
corrals
he
looked
across
the
meadow
at
exactly
the
right
moment
to
see
someone
riding
away
from
the
neighboring
ranch
he
watched
until
he
was
certain
that
whoever
it
was
was
not
coming
to
the
at
least
not
by
way
of
the
meadow
lane
then
smiling
to
himself
he
went
to
the
big
barn
and
saddled
a
horse
there
are
always
two
or
three
that
are
not
turned
out
in
the
pasture
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
riding
leisurely
away
on
the
simmons
road
along
the
western
edge
of
the
valley
an
hour
later
he
met
kitty
reid
who
was
on
her
way
from
simmons
to
the
the
young
woman
was
sincerely
glad
to
meet
him
but
you
were
going
to
simmons
were
you
not
she
asked
as
he
reined
his
horse
about
to
ride
with
her
to
be
truthful
i
was
going
to
simmons
if
i
met
anyone
else
or
if
i
had
not
met
you
he
answered
then
at
her
puzzled
look
he
explained
i
saw
someone
leave
your
house
and
guessed
that
it
was
you
i
guessed
too
that
you
would
be
coming
this
way
and
you
actually
rode
out
to
meet
me
actually
he
smiled
they
chatted
about
the
rodeo
and
the
news
of
the
countryside
for
it
had
been
several
weeks
since
they
had
met
and
so
reached
the
point
of
the
last
ridge
before
you
come
to
the
ranch
then
patches
asked
may
we
ride
over
there
on
the
ridge
and
sit
for
a
while
in
the
shade
of
that
old
cedar
for
a
little
talk
it
early
yet
and
it
been
ages
since
we
had
a
reaching
the
point
which
patches
had
chosen
they
left
their
horses
and
made
themselves
comfortable
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
overlooking
the
wide
valley
meadow
and
the
ranches
and
now
said
kitty
looking
at
him
curiously
what
the
talk
mr
honorable
patches
just
you
said
patches
gravely
me
your
own
charming
self
he
returned
but
please
good
sir
what
have
i
done
she
asked
or
perhaps
what
have
i
not
done
or
perhaps
he
retorted
it
what
you
are
going
to
do
oh
miss
reid
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
favor
a
great
favor
yes
you
have
known
me
now
almost
a
year
yes
and
yet
to
be
exact
you
do
not
know
me
at
all
she
did
not
answer
but
looked
at
him
steadily
and
that
in
a
way
he
continued
makes
it
easy
for
me
to
ask
the
favor
that
is
if
you
feel
that
you
can
trust
me
ever
so
little
trust
me
i
mean
to
the
extent
of
believing
me
sincere
i
know
that
you
are
sincere
patches
she
answered
gravely
thank
you
he
returned
then
he
said
gently
i
want
you
to
let
me
talk
to
you
about
what
is
most
emphatically
none
of
my
business
i
want
you
to
let
me
ask
you
impertinent
questions
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
about
he
hesitated
then
finished
with
meaning
about
your
career
she
felt
his
earnestness
and
was
big
enough
to
understand
and
be
grateful
for
the
spirit
that
prompted
his
words
why
patches
she
cried
after
all
that
your
friendship
has
meant
to
me
these
past
months
i
could
not
think
any
question
that
you
would
ask
impertinent
surely
you
know
that
do
you
i
hoped
that
you
would
feel
that
way
and
i
know
that
i
would
give
five
years
of
my
life
if
i
knew
how
to
convince
you
of
the
truth
which
i
have
learned
from
my
own
bitter
experience
and
save
you
from
from
yourself
she
could
not
mistake
his
earnestness
and
in
spite
of
herself
the
intense
feeling
moved
her
deeply
save
me
from
myself
she
questioned
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
patches
is
it
true
he
asked
that
your
father
is
offering
the
ranch
for
sale
and
that
you
are
going
out
of
the
williamson
valley
life
yes
but
it
is
not
such
a
sudden
move
as
it
seems
we
have
often
talked
about
it
at
home
father
and
mother
and
i
but
the
move
is
to
be
made
chiefly
on
your
account
is
it
not
she
flushed
a
little
at
this
but
answered
stoutly
yes
i
suppose
that
is
true
you
see
being
the
only
one
in
our
family
to
have
the
advantages
of
well
the
advantages
that
i
have
had
it
was
natural
that
i
should
surely
you
have
seen
patches
how
discontented
and
dissatisfied
i
have
been
with
the
life
here
why
until
you
came
there
was
no
one
to
whom
i
could
talk
even
no
one
i
mean
who
could
understand
but
what
is
it
that
you
want
or
expect
to
find
that
you
may
not
have
right
here
then
she
told
him
all
that
he
had
expected
to
hear
told
him
earnestly
passionately
of
the
life
she
craved
and
of
the
sordid
commonplace
narrowness
and
emptiness
as
she
saw
it
of
the
life
from
which
she
sought
to
escape
and
as
she
talked
the
man
good
heart
was
heavy
with
sadness
and
pity
for
her
oh
girl
girl
he
cried
when
she
had
finished
ca
you
you
understand
all
that
you
seek
is
right
here
everywhere
about
you
waiting
for
you
to
make
it
your
own
and
with
it
you
may
have
here
those
greater
things
without
which
no
life
can
be
abundant
and
joyous
the
culture
and
the
intellectual
life
that
is
dependent
upon
mere
environment
is
a
crippled
culture
and
a
sickly
life
the
mind
that
can
not
find
its
food
for
thought
wherever
it
may
be
planed
will
never
hobble
very
far
on
crutches
of
superficial
cults
and
societies
you
are
leaving
the
substance
child
for
the
shadow
you
are
seeking
the
fads
and
fancies
of
shallow
idlers
and
turning
your
back
upon
eternal
facts
you
are
following
after
silly
fools
who
are
chasing
bubbles
over
the
edge
of
god
good
world
believe
me
girl
i
know
god
but
i
do
know
what
that
life
stripped
of
its
tinseled
and
spangled
show
means
take
the
good
grain
child
and
let
the
husks
go
as
the
man
spoke
kitty
watched
him
as
though
she
were
intently
interested
but
in
truth
her
thoughts
were
more
on
the
speaker
than
on
what
he
said
you
are
in
earnest
are
you
patches
she
murmured
softly
i
am
he
returned
sharply
for
he
saw
that
she
was
not
even
considering
what
he
had
said
i
know
how
mistaken
you
are
i
know
what
it
will
mean
to
you
when
you
find
how
much
you
have
lost
and
how
little
you
have
gained
and
how
am
i
mistaken
do
i
not
know
what
i
want
am
i
not
better
able
than
anyone
else
to
say
what
satisfies
me
and
what
does
not
no
he
retorted
almost
harshly
you
are
not
you
it
is
the
culture
as
you
call
it
that
you
want
but
if
that
were
really
it
you
would
not
go
you
would
find
it
here
the
greatest
minds
that
the
world
has
ever
known
you
may
have
right
here
in
your
home
on
your
library
table
and
you
may
listen
to
their
thoughts
without
being
disturbed
by
the
magpie
chatterings
of
vain
and
shallow
pretenders
you
are
attracted
by
the
pretentious
forms
and
manners
of
that
life
you
think
that
because
a
certain
class
of
people
who
have
nothing
else
to
do
talk
a
certain
jargon
and
profess
to
follow
certain
teachers
who
nine
times
out
of
ten
are
charlatans
or
fools
that
they
are
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
leaders
of
the
race
you
are
mistaking
the
very
things
that
prevent
intellectual
and
spiritual
development
for
the
things
you
think
you
want
she
did
not
answer
his
thought
but
replied
to
his
words
and
supposing
i
am
mistaken
as
you
say
still
i
do
not
see
why
it
should
matter
so
to
you
he
made
a
gesture
of
hopelessness
and
sat
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
said
slowly
i
fear
you
will
not
understand
but
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
how
horse
phil
earned
his
title
she
laughed
why
of
course
everybody
knows
about
that
dear
foolish
old
phil
i
shall
miss
him
dreadfully
yes
he
said
significantly
you
will
miss
him
the
life
you
are
going
to
does
not
produce
phil
actons
it
produced
an
honorable
patches
she
retorted
slyly
indeed
it
did
he
answered
quickly
it
produced
he
checked
himself
as
though
fearing
that
he
would
say
too
much
but
what
have
phil
and
his
wild
horse
to
do
with
the
question
she
asked
nothing
i
fear
only
i
feel
about
your
going
away
as
phil
felt
when
he
gave
the
wild
horse
its
freedom
i
do
think
i
understand
she
said
genuinely
puzzled
i
said
you
would
not
he
retorted
bluntly
and
that
why
you
are
leaving
all
this
his
gesture
indicated
the
vast
sweep
of
country
with
old
granite
mountain
in
the
distance
then
with
a
nod
and
a
look
he
indicated
professor
parkhill
who
was
walking
toward
them
along
the
side
of
the
ridge
skirting
the
scattered
cedar
timber
here
comes
a
product
of
the
sort
of
culture
to
which
you
aspire
behold
the
ideal
manhood
of
your
higher
life
when
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
life
you
so
desire
succeeds
in
producing
racial
fruit
of
that
superior
quality
it
will
have
justified
its
existence
and
will
perish
from
the
earth
even
as
patches
spoke
he
saw
something
just
beyond
the
approaching
man
that
made
him
start
as
if
to
rise
to
his
feet
it
was
the
unmistakable
face
of
yavapai
joe
who
from
behind
an
oak
bush
was
watching
the
professor
patches
glancing
at
kitty
saw
that
she
had
not
noticed
before
the
young
woman
could
reply
to
her
companion
derisive
remarks
the
object
which
had
prompted
his
comments
arrived
within
speaking
distance
i
trust
i
am
not
intruding
began
the
professor
in
his
small
thin
voice
then
as
patches
his
eyes
still
on
that
oak
bush
stood
up
the
little
man
added
with
hasty
condescension
keep
your
seat
my
man
keep
your
seat
i
assure
you
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
deprive
you
of
miss
reid
company
patches
grinned
by
that
my
man
he
knew
that
kitty
had
not
enlightened
her
teacher
as
to
the
typical
cowboy
real
character
that
all
right
perfessor
he
said
awkwardly
i
just

a
maverick
over
yonder
i
reckon
i
better
mosey
along
an
have
a
closer
look
at
him

an

maverick
questioned
the
professor
and
what
may
i
ask
is
a
maverick
hit
a
critter
what
do
belong
to
nobody
answered
patches
moving
toward
his
horse
at
the
same
moment
kitty
who
had
risen
and
was
looking
in
the
direction
from
which
the
professor
had
come
exclaimed
why
yavapai
joe
patches
what
is
he
doing
here
she
pointed
and
the
professor
looking
caught
a
glimpse
of
joe
back
as
the
fellow
was
slinking
over
the
ridge
i
reckon
mebby
he
wants
to
see
me
somethin
or
other
patches
returned
as
he
mounted
his
horse
anyway
i
over
an
see
so
long
patches
rode
up
to
joe
just
as
the
tailholt
mountain
man
regained
his
horse
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
hello
joe
said
the
rider
easily
the
wretched
outcast
was
so
shaken
and
confused
that
he
could
scarcely
find
the
stirrup
with
his
foot
and
his
face
was
pale
and
twitching
with
excitement
he
looked
at
patches
wildly
but
spoke
in
a
sullen
tone
what
he
doin
here
what
does
he
want
how
did
he
get
to
this
country
anyhow
patches
was
amazed
but
spoke
calmly
whom
do
you
mean
joe
i
mean
that
man
back
there
parkhill
professor
parkhill
what
he
for
hangin
here
you

stopped
suddenly
and
with
a
characteristic
look
of
cunning
turned
away
patches

beside
him
for
some
distance
but
nothing
that
he

wretched

and

fellow
that

had
no
wish
to
be
anything
but
his
friend
if
only
yavapai
joe
would
accept
his

patches
an

how
me
an
you
is
friends
when
patches
reviewed
the
incident
as
he
rode
back
to
the
ranch
he
questioned
if
he
had
done
right
in
promising
joe
but
after
all
he
reassured
himself
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
interfere
with
what
was
clearly
none
of
his
business
he
could
not
see
that
the
matter
in
any
possible
way
touched
his
employer
interests
and
he
reflected
he
had
already
tried
the
useless
experiment
of
meddling
with
other
affairs
and
he
did
not
care
to
repeat
the
experience
that
evening
patches
asked
phil
permission
to
go
to
prescott
the
next
day
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
to
town
since
his
coming
to
the
ranch
and
the
foreman
readily
granted
his
request
a
few
minutes
later
as
phil
passed
through
the
kitchen
baldwin
remarked
i
wonder
what
patches
is
feeling
so
gay
about
ever
since
he
got
home
from
the
rodeo
he
been
singin
an
whistlin
an
grinnin
to
himself
all
the
time
he
went
out
to
the
corral
just
now
as
merry
as
a
lark
phil
laughed
anybody
would
be
glad
to
get
through
with
that
rodeo
mother
besides
he
is
going
to
town
he
is
well
you
mark
my
words
son
there
somethin
up
to
make
him
feel
as
good
as
he
does
and
then
when
phil
had
gone
on
out
into
the
yard
professor
parkhill
found
him
acton
began
the
guest
timidly
there
is
a
little
matter
about
which
i
feel
i
should
speak
to
you
very
well
sir
returned
the
cowboy
i
feel
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
speak
to
you
rather
than
to
baldwin
because
well
you
are
younger
and
will
i
am
sure
understand
more
readily
all
right
what
is
it
professor
asked
phil
encouragingly
wondering
at
the
man
manner
do
you
mind
ah
walking
a
little
way
down
the
road
as
they
strolled
out
toward
the
gate
to
the
meadow
road
the
professor
continued
i
think
i
should
tell
you
about
your
man
patches
phil
looked
at
his
companion
sharply
well
what
about
him
i
trust
you
will
not
misunderstand
my
interest
acton
when
i
say
that
it
also
includes
miss
reid
phil
stopped
short
instantly
baldwin
remark
about
happiness
his
own
confession
that
he
had
given
up
all
hope
of
winning
kitty
and
the
thought
of
the
friendship
which
he
had
seen
developing
during
the
past
months
with
the
realization
that
patches
belonged
to
that
world
to
which
kitty
aspired
all
swept
through
his
mind
he
was
looking
at
the
man
beside
him
so
intently
that
the
professor
said
again
uneasily
i
trust
acton
that
you
will
understand
phil
laughed
shortly
i
think
i
do
but
just
the
same
you
better
explain
what
about
patches
and
miss
reid
sir
the
professor
told
how
he
had
found
them
together
that
afternoon
oh
is
that
all
laughed
phil
but
surely
acton
you
do
not
think
that
a
man
of
that
evident
brutal
instincts
is
a
fit
associate
for
a
young
woman
of
miss
reid
character
and
refinement
perhaps
not
admitted
phil
still
laughing
but
i
guess
kitty
can
take
care
of
herself
i
do
not
agree
with
you
sir
said
the
other
authoritatively
a
young
woman
of
miss
reid
ah
spirituality
and
worldly
inexperience
must
always
be
to
a
certain
extent
injured
by
contact
with
such
illiterate
unrefined
and
i
have
no
doubt
morally
deficient
characters
but
look
here
professor
returned
phil
still
grinning
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
about
it
i
am
not
kitty
reid
guardian
why
do
you
talk
to
her
yourself
really
returned
the
little
man
i
there
are
reasons
why
i
do
not
see
my
way
clear
to
such
a
course
i
had
hoped
that
you
might
keep
an
eye
on
the
fellow
and
if
necessary
use
your
authority
over
him
to
prevent
any
such
incidents
in
the
future
i
see
what
i
can
do
answered
phil
thinking
how
the
dean
would
enjoy
the
joke
but
look
here
kitty
was
with
you
when
you
got
to
the
ranch
what
became
of
patches
run
did
he
when
you
appeared
on
the
scene
oh
no
he
went
away
with
a
with
a
maverick
went
away
with
a
maverick
what
in
heaven
name
do
you
mean
by
that
that
what
your
man
patches
said
the
fellow
was
miss
reid
told
me
his
name
was
joe
joe
something
phil
was
not
laughing
now
the
fun
of
the
situation
had
vanished
was
it
yavapai
joe
he
demanded
yes
that
was
it
i
am
quite
sure
that
was
the
name
he
belongs
at
tailend
mountain
i
think
miss
reid
said
you
have
such
curious
names
in
this
country
and
patches
went
away
with
him
you
say
yes
the
fellow
seemed
to
have
been
hiding
in
the
bushes
when
we
discovered
him
and
when
miss
reid
asked
what
he
was
doing
there
your
man
said
that
he
had
come
to
see
him
about
something
they
went
away
together
i
believe
as
soon
as
he
could
escape
from
the
professor
phil
went
straight
to
patches
who
was
in
his
room
reading
the
man
looked
up
with
a
welcoming
smile
as
phil
entered
but
as
he
saw
the
foreman
face
his
smile
vanished
quickly
and
he
laid
aside
his
book
patches
said
phil
abruptly
what
this
talk
of
the
about
you
and
yavapai
joe
i
do
know
what
the
professor
is
talking
patches
replied
coldly
as
though
he
did
not
exactly
like
the
tone
of
phil
question
he
says
that
joe
was
sneaking
about
in
the
brush
over
on
the
ridge
wanting
to
see
you
about
something
returned
phil
joe
was
certainly
over
there
on
the
ridge
and
he
may
have
wanted
to
see
me
at
any
rate
i
saw
him
well
i
got
to
ask
you
what
sort
of
business
you
have
with
that
tailholt
mountain
thief
that
makes
it
necessary
for
him
to
sneak
around
in
the
brush
for
a
meeting
with
you
if
he
wants
to
see
you
why
he
come
to
the
ranch
like
a
man
honorable
patches
looked
the
dean
foreman
straight
in
the
eyes
as
he
answered
in
a
tone
that
he
had
never
used
before
in
speaking
to
phil
and
i
have
to
answer
sir
that
my
business
with
yavapai
joe
is
entirely
personal
that
it
has
no
relation
whatever
to
your
business
as
the
foreman
of
this
ranch
as
to
why
joe
did
come
to
the
house
you
must
ask
him
i
do
know
you
refuse
to
explain
demanded
phil
i
certainly
refuse
to
discuss
joe
dryden
private
affairs
that
so
far
as
i
can
see
are
of
no
importance
to
anyone
but
himself
with
you
or
anyone
else
just
as
i
should
refuse
to
discuss
any
of
your
private
affairs
with
which
i
happened
by
some
chance
to
be
in
a
way
familiar
i
have
made
all
the
explanation
necessary
when
i
say
that
my
business
with
him
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
business
you
have
no
right
to
ask
me
anything
further
i
have
the
right
to
fire
you
retorted
phil
angrily
patches
smiled
as
he
answered
gently
you
have
the
right
phil
but
you
wo
use
it
and
why
not
because
you
are
not
that
kind
of
a
man
phil
acton
answered
patches
slowly
you
know
perfectly
well
that
if
you
discharged
me
because
of
my
friendship
with
poor
yavapai
joe
no
ranch
in
this
part
of
the
country
would
give
me
a
job
you
are
too
honest
yourself
to
condemn
any
man
on
mere
suspicion
and
you
are
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
damn
another
simply
because
he
too
aspires
to
that
distinction
very
well
patches
phil
returned
with
less
heat
but
i
want
you
to
understand
one
thing
i
am
responsible
for
the
property
and
there
is
no
friendship
in
the
world
strong
enough
to
influence
me
in
the
slightest
degree
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
uncle
interests
do
you
get
that
i
got
that
months
ago
phil
without
another
word
the
dean
foreman
left
the
room
patches
sat
for
some
time
considering
the
situation
and
now
and
then
his
lips
curled
in
that
old
smile
realizing
that
he
was
caught
in
the
trap
of
circumstance
he
found
a
curious
humor
in
his
predicament
chapter
xii
frontier
day
again
it
was
july
and
with
the
time
of
the
cattlemen
celebration
of
the
fourth
at
hand
riders
from
every
part
of
the
great
western
cow
country
assembled
in
prescott
for
their
annual
contests
from
texas
and
montana
from
oklahoma
and
new
mexico
and
wyoming
the
cowboys
came
with
their
saddles
and
riatas
to
meet
each
other
and
the
men
of
arizona
in
friendly
trials
of
strength
and
skill
from
many
a
wild
pasture
outlaw
horses
famous
for
their
vicious
unsubdued
spirits
and
their
fierce
untamed
strength
were
brought
to
match
their
wicked
unbroken
wills
against
the
cool
determined
courage
of
the
riders
from
the
wide
ranges
the
steers
that
were
to
participate
in
the
roping
and
contests
were
gathered
and
driven
in
from
many
a
ranch
the
fastest
and
best
of
the
trained
were
sent
for
the
various
cowboy
races
and
the
little
city
in
its
rocky
basin
upon
which
the
higher
surrounding
mountains
look
so
steadfastly
down
again
decked
itself
in
gala
colors
and
opened
wide
its
doors
to
welcome
all
who
chose
to
come
from
the
and
the
neighboring
ranches
the
cowboys
dressed
in
the
best
of
their
picturesque
regalia
rode
into
the
town
to
witness
and
take
part
in
the
sports
with
them
rode
honorable
patches
and
this
was
not
the
carefully
groomed
and
immaculately
attired
gentleman
who
in
troubled
spirit
had
walked
alone
over
that
long
unfenced
way
a
year
before
this
was
not
the
timid
hesitating
shamefaced
man
at
whom
phil
acton
had
laughed
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
this
was
a
man
among
men
a
cowboy
of
the
cowboys
bronzed
and
lean
and
rugged
vitally
alive
in
every
inch
of
his
long
body
with
courage
and
daring
hardihood
written
all
over
him
expressed
in
every
tone
of
his
voice
and
ringing
in
every
note
of
his
laughter
the
dean
and
baldwin
and
little
billy
drove
in
the
buckboard
but
the
distinguished
guest
of
the
went
with
the
reid
family
in
the
automobile
the
professor
was
not
at
all
interested
in
the
celebration
but
he
could
not
well
remain
at
the
ranch
alone
and
it
may
be
supposed
the
invitation
from
kitty
helped
to
make
the
occasion
endurable
the
celebration
this
year
the
posters
and
circulars
declared
was
to
be
the
biggest
and
best
that
prescott
had
ever
offered
in
proof
of
the
bold
assertion
the
program
promised
in
addition
to
the
usual
events
an
automobile
race
shades
of
all
those
mighty
heroes
of
the
saddle
whose
names
may
not
be
erased
from
the
history
of
the
great
west
think
of
it
an
automobile
race
offered
as
the
chief
event
in
a
frontier
day
celebration
no
wonder
that
manning
said
to
her
husband
that
day
but
stan
where
are
the
cowboys
stanford
manning
answered
laughingly
oh
they
are
here
all
right
helen
just
wait
a
little
and
you
will
see
and
manning
had
arrived
from
cleveland
ohio
the
evening
before
and
helen
was
eager
and
excited
with
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
people
and
witnessing
the
scenes
of
which
her
husband
had
told
her
with
so
much
enthusiasm
as
the
dean
had
told
patches
that
day
when
the
cattleman
had
advanced
the
money
for
the
stranger
outfit
the
young
mining
engineer
had
won
a
place
for
himself
amid
the
scenes
and
among
the
people
of
that
western
country
he
had
first
come
to
the
land
of
this
story
fresh
from
his
technical
training
in
the
east
his
employers
quick
to
recognize
not
only
his
ability
in
his
profession
but
his
character
and
manhood
as
well
had
advanced
him
rapidly
and
less
than
a
month
before
patches
asked
for
work
at
the
had
sent
him
on
an
important
mission
to
their
mines
in
the
north
they
were
sending
him
now
again
to
arizona
this
time
as
the
resident
manager
of
their
properties
in
the
prescott
district
this
new
advance
in
his
profession
together
with
the
substantial
increase
in
salary
which
it
brought
meant
much
to
the
engineer
most
of
all
it
meant
his
marriage
to
helen
wakefield
a
of
two
weeks
at
cleveland
on
way
west
from
the
main
offices
of
his
company
in
new
york
had
changed
his
return
to
prescott
from
a
simple
business
trip
to
a
wedding
journey
at
the
home
of
the
yavapai
club
on
top
of
the
hill
a
clock
above
the
plaza
a
number
of
prescott
citizens
with
their
guests
had
gathered
to
watch
the
beginning
of
the
automobile
race
the
course
from
the
corner
in
front
of
the
michael
hotel
followed
the
street
along
one
side
of
the
plaza
climbed
straight
up
the
hill
passed
the
clubhouse
and
so
away
into
the
open
country
from
the
clubhouse
veranda
from
the
lawn
and
walks
in
front
or
from
their
seats
in
convenient
automobiles
standing
near
the
company
enjoyed
thus
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
starting
point
of
the
race
and
could
look
down
as
well
upon
the
crowds
that
pressed
against
the
ropes
which
were
stretched
along
either
side
of
the
street
prom
a
friendly
automobile
helen
manning
with
her
husband
field
glasses
was
an
eager
and
excited
observer
of
the
interesting
scene
while
stanford
near
by
was
busy
greeting
old
friends
presenting
them
to
his
wife
and
receiving
their
congratulations
and
often
he
turned
with
a
fond
look
and
a
merry
word
to
the
young
woman
as
though
reassuring
himself
that
she
was
really
there
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
stamford
manning
strong
and
steady
and
forceful
was
very
much
in
love
with
this
girl
who
looked
down
into
his
face
with
such
an
air
of
sweet
confidence
and
companionship
and
helen
as
she
turned
from
the
scene
that
so
interested
her
to
greet
her
husband
friends
to
ask
him
some
question
or
to
answer
some
laughing
remark
could
not
hide
the
love
light
in
her
soft
brown
eyes
one
could
not
fail
to
see
that
her
woman
heart
was
glad
glad
and
proud
that
this
stalwart
leader
of
men
had
chosen
her
for
his
mate
but
stan
she
said
with
a
pretty
air
of
disappointment
i
thought
it
was
all
going
to
be
so
different
why
except
for
the
mountains
and
those
poor
indians
over
there
this
might
all
be
in
some
little
town
back
home
i
thought
there
would
be
cowboys
riding
about
everywhere
with
long
hair
and
big
hats
and
guns
and
things
stanford
and
his
friends
who
were
standing
near
laughed
i
fear
manning
remarked
richards
one
of
prescott
bank
presidents
that
stanford
has
been
telling
you
wild
west
stories
the
west
moves
as
well
as
the
east
you
know
we
are
becoming
civilized
indeed
you
are
richards
helen
returned
and
i
do
think
i
like
it
a
bit
it
not
fair
to
your
poor
eastern
like
myself
if
you
are
really
so
anxious
to
see
a
sure
enough
cowboy
look
over
there
said
stanford
and
pointed
across
the
street
where
demanded
helen
eagerly
there
smiled
stanford
the
chap
near
that
automobile
standing
by
the
curb
the
machine
with
the
pretty
girl
at
the
wheel
see
he
is
stopping
to
talk
with
the
girl
what
that
nice
looking
man
dressed
just
like
thousands
of
men
that
we
might
see
any
day
on
the
streets
of
cleveland
cried
helen
exactly
chuckled
her
husband
while
the
others
laughed
at
her
incredulous
surprise
but
just
the
same
that
phil
acton
horse
phil
if
you
please
he
is
the
cowboy
foreman
of
the
ranch
and
won
the
championship
in
the
bronco
riding
last
year
i
do
believe
it
you
are
making
fun
of
me
stanford
manning
then
before
he
could
answer
she
cried
with
quick
excitement
but
stan
look
look
at
the
girl
in
the
automobile
she
looks
like
it
is
stan
it
is
and
to
the
amazement
of
her
husband
and
her
friends
manning
sprang
to
her
feet
and
waving
her
handkerchief
called
kitty
oh
kitty
kitty
reid
as
her
clear
call
rang
out
many
people
turned
to
look
and
then
to
smile
at
the
picture
as
she
stood
there
in
the
bright
arizona
day
so
animated
and
wholesomely
alive
in
the
grace
and
charm
of
her
beautiful
young
womanhood
above
the
little
group
of
men
who
were
looking
up
at
her
with
laughing
admiration
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
where
she
sat
with
her
parents
and
professor
parkhill
talking
to
phil
kitty
heard
the
call
and
looked
a
moment
later
she
was
across
the
street
and
the
two
young
women
were
greeting
each
other
with
schoolgirl
enthusiasm
introductions
and
explanations
followed
with
frequent
feminine
exclamations
of
surprise
and
delight
then
the
men
drew
a
little
away
talking
laughing
as
men
will
on
such
occasions
leaving
the
two
women
to
themselves
in
that
eastern
school
which
for
those
three
years
had
been
home
helen
wakefield
and
the
girl
from
arizona
had
been
close
and
intimate
friends
indeed
helen
with
her
strong
womanly
character
and
that
rare
gift
of
helpful
sympathy
and
understanding
had
been
to
the
girl
fresh
from
the
cattle
ranges
more
than
a
friend
she
had
been
counsellor
and
companion
and
in
many
ways
a
wise
guardian
and
teacher
but
why
in
the
world
did
you
write
me
about
it
demanded
kitty
a
little
later
why
did
you
tell
me
that
you
had
become
stanford
manning
and
that
you
were
coming
to
prescott
helen
laughed
and
blushed
happily
why
you
see
kitty
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
there
was
no
time
to
write
you
remember
when
i
wrote
you
about
stan
i
told
you
how
poor
he
was
and
how
we
did
expect
to
be
married
for
several
years
yes
well
then
you
see
stan
company
all
unexpectedly
to
him
called
him
to
new
york
and
gave
him
this
position
out
here
he
had
to
start
at
once
and
wired
me
from
new
york
just
think
i
had
only
a
week
for
the
wedding
and
everything
i
knew
of
course
that
i
could
find
you
after
i
got
here
and
now
that
you
are
here
said
kitty
decisively
you
and
manning
are
coming
right
out
to
williamson
valley
to
spend
your
honeymoon
on
the
ranch
but
helen
shook
her
head
stan
has
it
all
planned
kitty
and
he
listen
to
anything
else
there
is
a
place
around
here
somewhere
that
he
calls
granite
basin
and
he
has
it
all
arranged
that
we
are
to
camp
out
there
for
three
weeks
his
company
has
given
him
that
much
time
and
we
are
going
just
as
soon
as
this
celebration
is
over
after
that
while
stan
gets
started
with
his
work
and
fixes
some
place
for
us
to
live
i
will
make
you
a
little
visit
i
suppose
there
is
no
use
trying
to
contend
against
the
rights
of
a
husband
returned
kitty
but
it
a
promise
that
you
will
come
to
me
as
soon
as
your
camping
trip
is
over
it
a
promise
agreed
helen
you
see
that
really
part
of
stanford
plan
i
was
so
sure
you
would
want
me
you
know
want
you
i
should
say
i
do
want
you
cried
kitty
and
i
need
you
too
something
in
her
voice
made
helen
look
at
her
questioningly
but
kitty
only
smiled
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
there
is
more
time
let
me
see
said
helen
there
used
to
be
why
of
course
that
nice
looking
man
you
were
talking
to
when
i
recognized
you
phil
acton
she
looked
across
the
street
as
she
spoke
but
phil
had
gone
please
do
helen
dear
said
kitty
that
was
only
my
schoolgirl
nonsense
when
i
came
back
home
i
found
how
impossible
it
all
was
but
i
must
run
back
to
the
folks
now
wo
you
come
and
meet
them
before
helen
could
answer
someone
shouted
they
getting
ready
for
the
start
and
everybody
looked
down
the
hill
toward
the
place
where
the
racing
machines
were
sputtering
and
roaring
in
their
clouds
of
blue
smoke
helen
caught
up
the
field
glasses
to
look
saying
we
ca
go
now
kitty
you
stay
here
with
us
until
after
the
race
is
started
then
go
as
helen
lowered
the
glasses
stanford
who
had
come
to
stand
beside
the
automobile
reached
out
his
hand
let
me
have
a
look
helen
they
say
my
old
friend
judge
morris
is
the
official
starter
he
put
the
field
glasses
to
his
eyes
there
he
is
all
right
as
big
as
life
finest
man
that
ever
lived
look
helen
he
returned
the
glasses
to
his
wife
if
you
want
to
see
a
genuine
western
lawyer
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
take
a
look
at
that
or
four
down
there
in
the
gray
clothes
i
see
him
said
helen
but
there
seems
to
be
some
thing
the
matter
there
he
goes
back
to
the
machines
now
he
laying
down
the
law
to
the
drivers
they
wo
put
over
anything
on
morris
said
stanford
admiringly
then
a
deep
kindly
voice
at
his
elbow
said
howdy
manning
ai
you
got
time
to
speak
to
your
old
friends
stanford
whirled
and
with
a
glad
exclamation
grasped
the
outstretched
hand
still
holding
fast
to
the
cattleman
he
again
turned
to
his
wife
who
was
looking
down
at
them
with
smiling
interest
helen
this
is
baldwin
the
dean
you
know
indeed
i
ought
to
know
the
dean
she
cried
giving
him
her
hand
stanford
has
told
me
so
much
about
you
that
i
am
in
love
with
you
already
and
i
retorted
the
dean
looking
up
at
her
with
his
blue
eyes
twinkling
approval
i
reckon
i
always
been
in
love
with
you
sure
glad
to
see
that
this
young
man
has
justified
his
reputation
for
good
judgment
have
they
got
any
more
girls
like
you
back
east
if
they
have
i
sure
be
obliged
to
take
a
trip
to
that
part
of
the
world
before
i
get
too
old
you
are
just
as
stan
said
you
were
retorted
helen
uncle
will
cried
kitty
i
am
ashamed
of
you
i
did
think
you
would
turn
down
your
own
home
folks
like
that
the
dean
lifted
his
hat
and
rumpled
his
grizzly
hair
as
though
fairly
caught
then
why
kitty
you
know
that
i
could
love
any
girl
more
than
i
do
you
why
you
belong
to
me
most
as
much
as
you
belong
to
your
own
father
and
mother
but
you
see
honey
well
you
see
we
just
naturally
got
to
be
nice
to
strangers
you
know
when
they
had
laughed
at
this
kitty
explained
to
that
dean
how
manning
was
the
helen
wakefield
with
whom
she
had
been
such
friends
at
school
and
that
after
the
mannings
outing
in
granite
basin
helen
was
to
visit
williamson
valley
campin
out
in
granite
basin
heh
said
the
dean
to
stanford
i
reckon
you
be
seein
some
o
my
boys
they
goin
up
into
that
country
after
outlaw
steers
next
week
i
hope
so
returned
stanford
helen
has
been
complaining
that
there
are
no
cowboys
to
be
seen
i
pointed
out
phil
acton
but
he
did
seem
to
fill
the
bill
she
does
believe
that
he
is
a
cowboy
at
all
the
dean
chuckled
he
never
been
anything
else
they
do
make
any
better
anywhere
then
he
added
soberly
phil
not
ridin
in
the
contest
this
year
though
what
the
matter
i
do
know
he
got
some
sort
of
a
fool
notion
in
his
head
that
he
do
want
to
make
an
exhibition
of
himself
that
what
he
said
got
another
man
on
the
ranch
now
he
added
as
though
to
change
the
subject
that
be
mighty
near
as
good
as
phil
in
another
year
his
name
is
patches
he
a
good
one
all
right
kitty
who
had
been
looking
away
down
the
street
while
the
dean
was
talking
put
her
hand
on
helen
arm
look
down
there
helen
i
believe
that
is
patches
now
that
man
sitting
on
his
horse
at
the
cross
street
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
just
outside
the
ropes
helen
was
looking
through
the
field
glasses
i
see
him
she
cried
now
that
more
like
it
he
looks
like
what
i
expected
to
see
what
a
fine
big
chap
he
is
is
he
then
as
she
studied
the
distant
horseman
a
puzzled
expression
came
over
her
face
why
kitty
she
said
in
a
low
tone
so
that
the
men
who
were
talking
did
not
hear
do
you
know
that
man
somehow
reminds
me
she
hesitated
and
lowered
the
glasses
to
look
at
her
companion
with
eyes
he
reminds
me
of
lawrence
knight
kitty
brown
eyes
glowed
with
mischief
really
manning
i
am
ashamed
of
you
before
the
honeymoon
has
waned
your
thoughts
with
no
better
excuse
than
the
appearance
of
a
poor
go
back
to
the
captivating
charms
of
your
old
millionaire
lover
i
kitty
do
hush
pleaded
helen
she
lifted
her
glasses
for
another
look
at
the
cowboy
i
do
wonder
that
your
conscience
reproves
you
teased
kitty
in
a
low
tone
but
tell
me
poor
child
how
did
it
happen
that
you
lost
your
millionaire
i
did
lose
him
retorted
helen
still
watching
patches
he
lost
me
kitty
persisted
with
a
playful
mockery
what
the
great
the
wonderful
knight
of
so
many
millions
failed
with
all
his
glittering
charms
to
captivate
the
fair
but
simple
helen
really
i
ca
believe
it
look
at
that
man
right
there
flashed
helen
proudly
indicating
her
husband
and
you
can
believe
it
kitty
laughed
so
gaily
that
stanford
turned
to
look
at
them
with
smiling
inquiry
never
mind
manning
said
kitty
we
are
just
reminiscing
all
do
miss
the
race
he
answered
they
getting
ready
again
to
start
it
looks
like
a
go
this
time
and
to
think
murmured
kitty
that
i
never
so
much
as
saw
your
knight
picture
but
you
used
to
like
lawrence
knight
did
you
helen
she
added
as
helen
lifted
her
field
glasses
again
and
now
manning
caught
a
note
of
earnest
inquiry
in
her
companion
voice
it
was
as
though
the
girl
were
seeking
confirmation
of
some
purpose
or
decision
of
her
own
why
yes
kitty
i
liked
larry
knight
very
much
she
answered
frankly
he
was
a
fine
fellow
in
many
ways
a
dear
good
friend
stanford
and
i
are
both
very
fond
of
him
they
were
college
mates
you
know
but
my
dear
girl
no
one
could
ever
consider
poor
old
larry
seriously
as
a
man
you
know
he
is
so
so
utterly
and
hopelessly
worthless
worthless
with
how
many
millions
is
it
oh
kitty
you
know
what
i
mean
but
really
dear
we
have
talked
enough
about
lawrence
knight
i
going
to
have
another
look
at
the
cowboy
looks
like
a
real
man
does
he
what
is
it
the
dean
called
him
patches
oh
yes
what
a
funny
name
patches
honorable
patches
said
kitty
how
odd
mused
helen
oh
stan
come
here
a
minute
take
the
glasses
and
look
at
that
cowboy
down
there
stanford
trained
the
field
glasses
as
she
directed
does
he
remind
you
of
larry
knight
larry
knight
stanford
looked
at
her
in
amazement
that
larry
knight
i
should
say
lord
but
would
fastidious
cultured
and
correct
old
larry
feel
complimented
to
know
that
you
found
anything
in
a
common
to
remind
you
of
him
but
here
take
your
glasses
quick
they
are
going
to
start
at
last
even
as
helen
looked
judge
morris
gave
the
signal
and
the
first
racing
car
with
a
mighty
roar
leaped
away
from
the
starting
point
and
thundered
up
the
street
between
the
lines
of
the
crowding
cheering
people
an
instant
more
and
helen
manning
witnessed
a
scene
that
thrilled
the
hearts
of
every
man
woman
and
child
in
that
great
crowd
as
the
big
racing
car
gathering
speed
at
every
throb
of
its
powerful
motor
swept
toward
the
hill
a
small
boy
but
little
more
than
a
toddling
baby
escaped
from
his
mother
who
with
the
excited
throng
was
crowding
against
the
rope
barrier
and
before
those
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
automobile
noticed
the
child
was
in
the
street
fairly
in
the
path
of
the
approaching
machine
a
sudden
hush
fell
on
the
shouting
multitude
helen
through
the
field
glasses
could
see
even
the
face
as
laughing
gleefully
he
looked
back
when
his
mother
screamed
stricken
with
horror
the
young
woman
could
not
lower
her
glasses
fascinated
she
watched
the
people
seemed
for
an
instant
paralyzed
not
a
soul
moved
or
uttered
a
sound
would
the
driver
of
the
racing
car
swerve
aside
from
his
course
in
time
if
he
did
would
the
baby
in
sudden
fright
dodge
in
front
of
the
machine
then
helen
saw
the
cowboy
who
had
so
interested
her
lean
forward
in
his
saddle
and
strike
his
spurs
deep
in
the
flanks
of
his
already
restless
horse
with
a
tremendous
bound
the
animal
cleared
the
rope
barrier
and
in
an
instant
was
leaping
toward
the
child
and
the
approaching
car
the
people
gasped
at
the
daring
of
the
man
who
had
not
waited
to
think
it
was
over
in
a
second
as
patches
swept
by
the
child
he
leaned
low
from
the
saddle
and
as
the
next
leap
of
his
horse
carried
him
barely
clear
of
the
machine
they
saw
his
tall
lithe
body
straighten
as
he
swung
the
baby
up
into
his
arms
then
indeed
the
crowd
went
wild
men
yelled
and
cheered
women
laughed
and
cried
and
as
the
cowboy
returned
the
frightened
baby
to
the
distressed
mother
a
hundred
eager
hands
were
stretched
forth
to
greet
him
but
the
excited
horse
backed
away
someone
raised
the
rope
barrier
and
patches
disappeared
down
the
side
street
helen
eyes
were
wet
but
she
was
smiling
no
she
said
softly
to
kitty
and
stanford
that
was
lawrence
knight
poor
old
larry
never
could
have
done
that
it
was
a
little
after
the
noon
hour
when
kitty
who
with
her
father
mother
and
brothers
had
been
for
dinner
at
the
home
of
one
of
their
prescott
friends
was
crossing
the
plaza
on
her
way
to
join
and
manning
with
whom
she
was
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
a
less
frequented
corner
of
the
little
park
back
of
the
courthouse
she
saw
patches
the
cowboy
who
had
changed
from
his
ranch
costume
to
a
less
picturesque
business
garb
was
seated
alone
on
one
of
the
benches
that
are
placed
along
the
walks
reading
a
letter
with
his
attention
fixed
upon
the
letter
he
did
not
notice
kitty
as
she
approached
and
the
girl
when
she
first
caught
sight
of
him
paused
for
an
instant
then
she
went
toward
him
slowly
studying
him
with
a
new
interest
she
was
quite
near
when
looking
up
he
saw
her
instantly
he
rose
to
his
feet
slipped
the
letter
into
his
pocket
and
stood
before
her
hat
in
hand
to
greet
her
with
genuine
pleasure
and
with
that
gentle
courtesy
which
always
marked
his
bearing
and
kitty
as
she
looked
up
at
him
felt
more
convincingly
than
ever
that
this
man
would
be
perfectly
at
ease
in
the
most
exacting
social
company
i
fear
i
interrupted
you
said
the
young
woman
i
was
just
passing
not
at
all
he
protested
surely
you
can
give
me
a
moment
of
your
busy
gala
day
i
know
you
have
a
host
of
friends
of
course
but
well
i
am
lonely
curly
and
bob
and
the
boys
are
all
having
the
time
of
their
lives
the
dean
and
mother
are
lunching
with
friends
and
i
do
know
where
phil
has
hidden
himself
it
was
like
him
to
mention
phil
in
almost
his
first
words
to
her
and
kitty
as
patches
spoke
phil
name
instantly
as
she
had
so
often
done
during
the
past
few
months
mentally
placed
the
two
men
side
by
side
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
she
hesitated
patches
i
beg
your
pardon
he
interrupted
smiling
well
patches
then
but
you
seem
so
different
somehow
dressed
like
this
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
saw
what
happened
this
morning
it
was
splendid
why
miss
reid
you
know
that
was
nothing
the
driver
of
the
car
would
probably
have
dodged
the
youngster
anyway
i
acted
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
without
thinking
i
always
doing
something
unnecessarily
foolish
you
know
the
driver
of
the
car
would
more
likely
have
dodged
into
the
child
she
returned
warmly
and
it
was
fortunate
that
some
one
in
all
that
stupid
crowd
could
act
without
taking
time
to
think
everybody
says
so
the
dear
old
dean
is
as
pleased
and
proud
as
though
you
were
one
of
his
own
sons
really
you
make
too
much
of
it
he
returned
clearly
embarrassed
by
her
praise
tell
me
you
are
enjoying
the
celebration
and
what
the
matter
with
phil
ca
you
persuade
him
to
ride
in
the
contest
we
do
want
the
championship
to
go
out
of
yavapai
county
do
we
why
must
he
always
bring
phil
into
their
talk
kitty
asked
herself
i
am
sure
that
phil
knows
how
all
his
friends
feel
about
his
riding
she
said
coolly
if
he
does
not
wish
to
gratify
them
it
is
really
a
small
matter
is
it
not
patches
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
changed
easily
to
a
safer
topic
you
saw
the
beginning
of
the
automobile
race
of
course
i
suppose
you
will
be
on
hand
this
afternoon
for
the
finish
oh
yes
i
on
my
way
now
to
join
my
friends
and
stanford
manning
we
are
going
to
see
the
finish
of
the
race
together
she
watched
his
face
closely
as
she
spoke
of
her
friends
but
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
ever
heard
the
name
before
it
will
be
worth
seeing
i
fancy
he
returned
at
least
everybody
seems
to
feel
that
way
i
am
sure
to
have
a
good
time
anyway
she
returned
because
you
see
manning
is
one
of
my
very
dearest
girl
friends
whom
i
have
not
seen
for
a
long
time
indeed
you
enjoy
the
afternoon
then
was
there
a
shade
too
much
enthusiasm
in
the
tone
of
his
reply
kitty
wondered
could
it
be
that
his
plea
of
loneliness
was
merely
a
conventional
courtesy
and
that
he
was
really
relieved
to
find
that
she
was
engaged
for
the
afternoon
yes
and
i
must
hurry
on
to
them
or
they
will
think
i
am
not
coming
she
said
have
a
good
time
patches
you
surely
have
earned
it
he
stood
for
a
moment
watching
her
cross
the
park
then
with
a
quick
look
around
as
though
he
did
not
wish
to
be
observed
he
hurried
across
the
street
to
the
western
union
office
a
few
moments
later
he
made
his
way
by
side
streets
to
the
stable
where
he
had
left
his
horse
and
while
kitty
and
her
friends
were
watching
the
first
of
the
racing
cars
cross
the
line
patches
was
several
miles
away
riding
as
though
pursued
by
the
sheriff
straight
for
the
ranch
several
times
that
day
while
she
was
with
her
eastern
friends
kitty
saw
phil
near
by
but
she
gave
him
no
signal
to
join
them
and
the
cowboy
shy
always
and
hurt
by
kitty
indifference
would
not
approach
the
little
party
without
her
invitation
but
that
evening
while
kitty
was
waiting
in
the
hotel
lobby
for
and
manning
phil
finding
her
alone
went
to
her
i
have
been
trying
to
speak
to
you
all
day
he
said
reproachfully
have
you
any
time
for
me
at
all
kitty
do
be
foolish
phil
she
returned
you
have
seen
me
a
dozen
times
i
have
you
yes
he
answered
bitterly
but
phil
you
could
have
come
to
me
if
you
had
wanted
to
i
have
no
desire
to
go
where
i
am
not
wanted
he
answered
phil
well
you
gave
no
sign
that
you
wanted
me
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
she
retorted
you
are
not
a
child
i
was
with
my
friends
from
the
east
you
could
have
joined
us
if
you
had
cared
to
i
should
be
very
glad
indeed
to
present
you
to
and
mrs
manning
thank
you
but
i
do
care
to
be
exhibited
as
an
interesting
specimen
to
people
who
have
no
use
for
me
except
when
i
do
a
few
fool
stunts
to
amuse
them
very
well
phil
she
returned
coldly
if
that
is
your
feeling
i
do
not
care
to
present
you
to
my
friends
they
are
every
bit
as
sincere
and
genuine
as
you
are
and
i
certainly
shall
not
trouble
them
with
anyone
who
can
not
appreciate
them
kitty
was
angry
as
she
had
good
reason
for
being
but
beneath
her
anger
she
was
sorry
for
the
man
whose
bitterness
she
knew
was
born
of
his
love
for
her
and
phil
saw
only
that
kitty
was
lost
to
him
saw
in
the
girl
eastern
friends
those
who
he
felt
had
robbed
him
of
his
dream
i
suppose
he
said
after
a
moment
painful
silence
that
i
had
better
go
back
to
the
range
where
i
belong
i
out
of
place
here
the
girl
was
touched
by
the
hopelessness
in
his
voice
but
she
felt
that
it
would
be
no
kindness
to
offer
him
the
relief
of
an
encouraging
word
her
day
with
her
eastern
friends
and
the
memories
that
her
meeting
with
manning
had
aroused
convinced
her
more
than
ever
that
her
old
love
for
phil
and
the
life
of
which
he
was
a
part
were
for
her
impossible
when
she
did
not
speak
the
cowboy
said
bitterly
i
noticed
that
your
fine
friends
did
not
take
quite
all
your
time
you
found
an
opportunity
for
a
quiet
little
visit
with
honorable
patches
kitty
was
angry
now
in
earnest
you
are
forgetting
yourself
phil
she
answered
with
cold
dignity
and
i
think
that
as
long
as
you
feel
as
you
do
toward
my
friends
and
can
speak
to
me
like
this
about
patches
you
are
right
in
saying
that
you
belong
on
the
range
and
manning
are
here
i
see
i
am
going
to
dine
with
them
she
turned
away
leaving
him
standing
there
a
moment
he
waited
as
though
stunned
then
he
turned
to
make
his
way
blindly
out
of
the
hotel
it
was
nearly
morning
when
patches
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
someone
moving
about
the
kitchen
a
moment
he
listened
then
rising
went
quickly
to
the
kitchen
door
thinking
to
surprise
some
chance
night
visitor
when
phil
saw
him
standing
there
the
foreman
for
a
moment
said
nothing
but
with
the
bread
knife
in
one
hand
and
one
of
stella
good
loaves
in
the
other
stared
at
him
in
blank
surprise
then
the
look
of
surprise
changed
to
an
expression
of
questioning
suspicion
and
he
demanded
harshly
what
in
hell
are
doing
here
patches
saw
that
the
man
was
laboring
under
some
great
trouble
indeed
phil
voice
and
manner
were
not
unlike
one
under
the
influence
of
strong
drink
but
patches
knew
that
phil
never
drank
i
was
sleeping
he
answered
calmly
you
woke
me
i
suppose
i
heard
you
and
came
to
see
who
was
prowling
around
the
kitchen
at
this
time
of
the
night
that
is
all
oh
that
all
is
it
but
what
are
you
here
for
why
are
you
in
prescott
where
you
are
supposed
to
be
patches
because
he
saw
phil
painful
state
of
mind
exercised
admirable
i
supposed
i
had
a
perfect
right
to
come
here
if
i
wished
i
did
not
dream
that
my
presence
in
this
house
would
be
questioned
that
depends
phil
retorted
why
did
you
leave
prescott
patches
still
calm
answered
gently
my
reasons
for
not
staying
in
prescott
are
entirely
personal
phil
i
do
not
care
to
explain
just
now
oh
you
do
well
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
you
have
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
personal
business
that
you
ca
explain
i
am
afraid
i
have
returned
patches
with
his
old
smile
but
look
here
phil
you
are
disturbed
and
all
wrought
up
about
something
or
you
would
attack
me
like
this
you
do
really
think
me
a
suspicious
character
and
you
know
you
do
you
are
not
yourself
old
man
and
i
be
hanged
if
i
take
anything
you
say
as
an
insult
until
i
know
that
you
say
it
deliberately
in
cold
blood
i
sorry
for
your
trouble
phil
damned
sorry
i
would
give
anything
if
i
could
help
you
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
prove
that
later
but
just
now
i
think
the
kindest
and
wisest
thing
that
i
can
do
for
us
both
is
to
say
he
turned
at
the
last
word
without
waiting
for
phil
to
speak
and
went
back
to
his
room
chapter
xiii
in
granite
basin
on
the
other
side
of
granite
mountain
from
where
phil
and
patches
watched
the
wild
horses
that
day
there
is
a
rocky
hollow
set
high
in
the
hills
but
surrounded
on
every
side
by
still
higher
peaks
and
ridges
lying
close
under
the
sheer
towering
cliffs
of
the
mountain
those
walls
so
gray
and
grim
and
old
seem
to
overshadow
the
place
with
a
somber
quiet
as
though
the
memories
of
the
many
ages
that
had
wrought
their
countless
years
into
those
mighty
battlements
gave
to
the
very
atmosphere
a
feeling
of
solemn
and
sacred
seclusion
it
was
as
though
nature
had
thrown
about
this
spot
a
strong
protecting
guard
that
here
in
her
very
heart
she
might
keep
unprofaned
the
sweetness
and
strength
and
beauty
of
her
primitive
and
everlasting
treasures
in
its
wild
and
rugged
setting
granite
basin
has
for
the
few
who
have
the
hardihood
to
find
them
many
beautiful
glades
and
shady
nooks
where
the
grass
and
wild
flowers
weave
their
lovely
patterns
for
the
earth
floor
and
tall
pines
spread
their
soft
carpets
of
brown
while
giant
oaks
and
sycamores
lift
their
cathedral
arches
to
support
the
ceilings
of
green
and
dark
rock
fountains
set
in
banks
of
moss
and
fern
hold
water
clear
and
cold
it
was
to
one
of
these
that
stanford
manning
brought
his
bride
for
their
honeymoon
stanford
himself
pitched
their
tent
and
made
their
simple
camp
for
it
was
not
in
his
plan
that
the
sweet
intimacy
of
these
the
first
weeks
of
their
mated
life
should
be
marred
even
by
servants
and
helen
wise
in
her
love
permitted
him
to
realize
his
dream
in
the
fullness
of
its
every
detail
as
she
lay
in
the
hammock
which
he
had
hung
for
her
under
the
canopy
of
living
green
and
watched
him
while
he
brought
wood
for
their
camp
fire
and
made
all
ready
for
the
night
which
was
drawing
near
she
was
glad
that
he
had
planned
it
so
but
more
than
that
she
was
glad
that
he
was
the
kind
of
a
man
who
would
care
to
plan
it
so
then
when
all
was
finished
he
came
to
sit
beside
her
and
together
they
watched
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
fade
from
the
summit
of
old
granite
and
saw
the
flaming
that
hung
above
the
mountain
castle
towers
furled
by
the
hand
of
night
in
silence
they
watched
those
mighty
towering
battlements
grow
cold
and
grim
until
against
the
sky
the
shadowy
bulk
stood
mysterious
and
awful
as
though
to
evidence
in
its
grandeur
and
strength
the
omnipotent
might
and
power
of
the
master
builder
of
the
world
and
giver
of
all
life
and
when
the
soft
darkness
was
fully
come
and
the
low
murmuring
voices
of
the
night
whispered
from
forest
depth
and
mountain
side
while
the
stars
peered
through
the
weaving
of
leaf
and
branch
and
the
ruddy
light
of
their
camp
fire
rose
and
fell
the
man
talked
of
the
things
that
had
gone
into
the
making
of
his
life
as
though
he
wished
his
mate
to
know
him
more
fully
than
anyone
else
could
know
he
spoke
of
those
personal
trials
and
struggles
those
disappointments
and
failures
those
plans
and
triumphs
of
which
men
so
rarely
speak
of
his
boyhood
and
his
boyhood
home
life
of
his
father
and
mother
of
those
hard
years
of
his
youth
and
his
struggle
for
an
education
that
would
equip
him
for
his
chosen
life
work
he
told
her
many
things
that
she
had
known
only
in
a
general
way
but
most
of
all
he
talked
of
those
days
when
he
had
first
met
her
and
of
how
quickly
and
surely
the
acquaintance
had
grown
into
friendship
and
then
into
a
love
which
he
dared
not
yet
confess
smilingly
he
told
how
he
had
tried
to
convince
himself
that
she
was
not
for
him
and
how
believing
that
she
loved
and
would
wed
his
friend
lawrence
knight
he
had
come
to
the
far
west
to
his
work
and
if
he
could
to
forget
but
i
could
not
forget
dear
girl
he
said
i
could
not
escape
the
conviction
that
you
belonged
to
me
as
i
felt
that
i
belonged
to
you
i
could
not
banish
the
feeling
that
some
mysterious
higher
law
the
law
that
governs
the
mating
of
the
beautifully
free
creatures
that
live
in
these
hills
had
mated
you
and
me
and
so
as
i
worked
and
tried
to
forget
i
went
on
dreaming
just
the
same
it
was
that
way
when
i
first
saw
this
place
i
was
crossing
the
country
on
my
way
to
examine
some
prospects
for
the
company
and
camped
at
this
very
spot
and
that
evening
i
planned
it
all
just
as
it
is
i
put
the
tent
there
and
built
our
fire
and
stretched
your
hammock
under
the
tree
and
sat
with
you
in
the
twilight
but
even
as
i
dreamed
it
i
laughed
at
myself
for
a
fool
for
i
could
not
believe
that
the
dream
would
ever
come
true
and
then
when
i
got
back
to
prescott
there
was
a
letter
from
a
cleveland
friend
telling
me
that
larry
had
gone
abroad
to
be
away
a
year
or
more
and
another
letter
from
the
company
calling
me
east
again
and
so
i
stopped
at
cleveland
and
he
laughed
happily
i
know
now
that
dreams
do
come
true
you
foolish
boy
said
helen
softly
to
think
that
i
did
not
know
why
when
you
went
away
i
was
so
sure
that
you
would
come
for
me
again
that
i
never
even
thought
that
it
could
be
any
other
way
i
thought
you
did
not
speak
because
you
felt
that
you
were
too
poor
because
you
felt
that
you
had
so
little
to
offer
and
because
you
wished
to
prove
yourself
and
your
work
before
asking
me
to
share
your
life
i
did
not
dream
that
you
could
doubt
my
love
for
you
or
think
for
a
moment
that
there
could
ever
be
anyone
else
i
felt
that
you
know
and
so
you
see
while
i
waited
i
had
my
dreams
too
but
do
you
see
girl
he
answered
as
though
for
a
moment
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
his
own
happiness
do
you
see
larry
is
such
a
splendid
fellow
and
you
two
were
such
friends
and
you
always
seemed
so
fond
of
him
and
with
his
wealth
he
could
give
you
so
much
that
i
knew
i
never
could
give
of
course
i
am
fond
of
larry
everyone
is
he
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
in
the
world
but
to
make
himself
charming
and
pleasant
and
entertaining
and
amusing
why
stan
i
do
suppose
that
in
all
his
life
he
ever
did
one
single
thing
that
was
necessary
or
useful
he
even
had
a
man
to
help
him
dress
he
is
cultured
and
intellectual
and
bright
and
witty
and
clean
and
possessing
in
fact
all
the
qualifications
of
a
desirable
lap
dog
and
you
ca
help
liking
him
just
as
you
would
like
a
pretty
useless
pet
stanford
chuckled
she
had
described
lawrence
knight
so
accurately
poor
old
larry
he
said
what
a
man
he
might
have
been
if
he
had
not
been
so
pampered
and
petted
and
envied
and
spoiled
all
because
of
his
father
money
his
heart
is
right
and
at
the
bottom
he
has
the
right
sort
of
stuff
in
him
his
athletic
record
at
school
showed
us
that
i
think
that
was
why
we
all
liked
him
so
in
spite
of
his
uselessness
i
wish
you
could
have
known
my
father
stan
said
helen
thoughtfully
as
though
she
too
were
moved
to
speak
by
the
wish
that
her
mate
might
know
more
of
the
things
that
had
touched
her
deeper
life
i
wish
so
too
he
answered
i
know
that
he
must
have
been
fine
he
was
my
ideal
she
answered
softly
my
other
ideal
i
mean
from
the
time
i
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
he
made
me
his
chum
until
he
died
we
were
always
together
mother
died
when
i
was
a
baby
you
know
many
many
times
he
would
take
me
with
him
when
he
made
his
professional
visits
to
his
patients
leaving
me
in
the
buggy
to
wait
at
each
house
be
his
hitching
post
he
used
to
say
and
on
those
long
rides
sometimes
out
into
the
country
he
talked
to
me
as
i
suppose
not
many
fathers
talk
to
their
daughters
and
because
he
was
my
father
and
a
physician
and
because
we
were
so
much
alone
in
our
companionship
i
believed
him
the
wisest
and
best
man
in
all
the
world
and
felt
that
nothing
he
said
or
did
could
be
wrong
and
so
you
see
dear
my
ideal
man
the
man
to
whom
i
could
give
myself
came
to
be
the
kind
of
a
man
that
my
father
placed
in
the
highest
rank
among
men
a
man
like
you
stan
and
almost
the
last
talk
we
had
before
he
died
father
said
to
me
i
remember
his
very
words
daughter
it
will
not
be
long
now
until
men
will
seek
you
until
someone
will
ask
you
to
share
his
life
keep
your
ideal
man
safe
in
your
heart
of
hearts
daughter
and
remember
that
no
matter
what
a
suitor
may
have
to
offer
of
wealth
or
social
rank
if
he
is
not
your
ideal
if
you
can
not
respect
and
admire
him
for
his
character
and
manhood
alone
say
no
say
no
child
at
any
cost
but
when
your
ideal
man
comes
the
one
who
compels
your
respect
and
admiration
for
his
strength
of
character
and
for
the
usefulness
of
his
life
the
one
whom
you
can
not
help
loving
for
his
manhood
alone
mate
with
him
no
matter
how
light
his
purse
or
how
lowly
his
rank
in
the
world
and
so
you
see
as
soon
as
i
learned
to
know
you
i
realized
what
you
were
to
me
but
i
wish
oh
how
i
wish
that
father
could
have
lived
to
know
you
too
for
some
time
they
watched
the
dancing
camp
fire
flames
in
silence
as
though
they
had
found
in
their
love
that
true
oneness
that
needs
no
spoken
word
then
stanford
said
and
to
think
that
we
expected
to
wait
two
years
or
more
and
now
thanks
to
a
soulless
corporation
we
are
here
in
a
little
less
than
a
year
thanks
to
no
soulless
corporation
for
that
sir
retorted
helen
with
spirit
but
thanks
to
the
brains
and
strength
and
character
of
my
husband
two
of
the
three
weeks
vacation
granted
the
engineer
had
passed
when
manning
one
afternoon
informed
her
husband
that
as
the
ordained
provider
for
the
household
it
was
imperative
that
he
provide
some
game
for
their
evening
meal
and
what
does
her
majesty
the
cook
desire
he
asked
venison
perhaps
she
shook
her
head
with
decision
you
will
be
obliged
to
go
too
far
and
be
gone
too
long
to
get
a
deer
but
you
going
with
me
of
course
again
she
shook
her
head
i
have
something
else
to
do
i
ca
always
be
tagging
around
after
you
while
you
are
providing
you
know
and
we
may
as
well
begin
to
be
civilized
again
just
go
a
little
way
not
so
far
that
you
ca
hear
me
call
and
bring
me
some
nice
fat
quail
like
those
we
had
day
before
yesterday
she
watched
him
disappear
in
the
brush
and
then
busied
herself
about
the
camp
presently
she
heard
the
gun
and
smiled
as
she
pictured
him
hunting
for
their
supper
much
as
though
they
were
two
primitive
children
of
nature
instead
of
the
two
cultured
members
of
a
highly
civilized
race
that
they
really
were
then
presently
she
must
go
to
the
spring
for
water
that
he
might
have
a
cool
drink
when
he
returned
she
was
half
way
to
the
spring
singing
softly
to
herself
when
a
sound
on
the
low
ridge
above
the
camp
attracted
her
attention
pausing
she
looked
and
listened
the
song
died
on
her
lips
it
could
not
be
staford
coming
so
noisily
through
the
brush
and
from
that
direction
even
as
the
thought
came
she
heard
the
gun
again
a
little
farther
away
down
the
narrow
valley
below
the
camp
and
in
the
same
moment
the
noise
on
the
ridge
grew
louder
as
though
some
heavy
animal
were
crashing
through
the
bushes
and
then
suddenly
as
she
stood
there
in
frightened
indecision
a
steer
broke
through
the
brush
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
plunged
down
the
steep
slope
toward
the
camp
weak
and
helpless
with
fear
helen
could
neither
scream
nor
run
but
stood
fascinated
by
the
very
danger
that
menaced
her
powerless
even
to
turn
her
eyes
away
from
the
frightful
creature
that
had
so
rudely
broken
the
quiet
seclusion
of
the
little
glade
behind
the
steer
even
as
the
frenzied
animal
leaped
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
she
saw
a
horseman
as
wild
in
his
appearance
and
in
his
reckless
rushing
haste
as
the
creature
he
pursued
curiously
as
in
a
dream
she
saw
the
neck
and
shoulders
dripping
wet
with
sweat
as
with
ears
flat
nose
outstretched
and
nostrils
wide
the
animal
strained
every
nerve
in
an
effort
to
put
his
rider
a
few
feet
closer
to
the
escaping
quarry
she
even
noted
the
fringed
leather
chaps
the
faded
blue
jumper
the
broad
hat
of
the
rider
and
that
in
his
rein
hand
he
held
the
coil
of
a
riata
high
above
the
saddle
horn
while
in
his
right
was
the
loop
the
bridle
reins
were
loose
as
though
he
gave
the
horse
no
thought
and
they
took
the
steep
downward
plunge
from
the
summit
of
the
ridge
without
an
instant
pause
and
apparently
with
all
the
ease
and
confidence
that
they
would
have
felt
on
smooth
and
level
ground
the
steer
catching
sight
of
the
woman
and
seeing
in
her
perhaps
another
enemy
swerved
a
little
in
his
plunging
course
and
with
lowered
head
charged
straight
at
her
the
loop
of
that
rawhide
rope
was
whirling
now
above
the
cowboy
head
and
his
spurs
drew
blood
from
the
heaving
flanks
of
the
straining
horse
as
every
mad
leap
of
the
steer
brought
death
a
few
feet
nearer
the
helpless
woman
the
situation
must
have
broken
with
frightful
suddenness
upon
the
man
but
he
gave
no
sign
no
startled
shout
no
excited
movement
he
even
appeared
to
helen
to
be
as
coolly
deliberate
as
though
no
thought
of
her
danger
disturbed
him
and
she
recognized
even
in
that
awful
moment
the
cowboy
whom
she
had
watched
through
the
field
glasses
that
day
of
the
celebration
at
prescott
she
could
not
know
that
in
the
same
instant
as
his
horse
plunged
down
from
the
summit
of
the
ridge
patches
had
recognized
her
and
that
as
his
hand
swung
the
riata
with
such
cool
and
deliberate
precision
the
man
was
praying
praying
as
only
a
man
who
sees
the
woman
he
loves
facing
a
dreadful
death
with
no
hand
but
his
to
save
her
could
pray
god
help
him
if
his
training
of
nerve
and
hand
should
fail
now
christ
pity
him
if
that
whirling
loop
should
miss
its
mark
or
fall
short
his
eye
told
him
that
the
distance
was
still
too
great
he
must
he
lessen
it
and
again
his
spurs
drew
blood
he
must
be
cool
cool
and
steady
and
sure
and
he
must
act
now
now
helen
saw
the
racing
horse
make
a
desperate
leap
as
the
spurs
tore
his
heaving
sides
she
saw
that
swiftly
whirling
loop
leave
the
hand
as
the
man
leaned
forward
in
his
saddle
curiously
she
watched
the
loop
open
with
beautiful
precision
as
the
coils
were
loosed
and
the
long
thin
line
lengthened
through
the
air
it
seemed
to
move
so
slowly
those
wickedly
lowered
horns
were
so
near
then
she
saw
the
rider
right
hand
move
with
flashlike
quickness
to
the
saddle
horn
as
he
threw
his
weight
back
and
the
horse
with
legs
braced
and
hoofs
plowing
the
ground
stopped
in
half
his
own
length
and
set
his
weight
against
the
weight
of
the
steer
the
flexible
riata
straightened
as
a
rod
of
iron
the
steer
head
jerked
sideways
his
horns
buried
themselves
in
the
ground
he
fell
almost
at
her
feet
and
then
as
the
cowboy
leaped
from
his
horse
helen
felt
herself
sinking
into
a
soft
thick
darkness
that
try
as
she
might
she
could
not
escape
still
master
of
himself
but
with
a
kind
of
fierce
coolness
patches
ran
to
the
fallen
steer
and
securely
tied
the
animal
down
but
when
he
turned
to
the
woman
who
lay
unconscious
on
the
ground
a
sob
burst
from
his
lips
and
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
and
as
he
knelt
beside
her
he
called
again
and
again
that
name
which
a
year
before
he
had
whispered
as
he
stood
with
empty
outstretched
arms
alone
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
lifting
her
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
to
the
hammock
and
finding
water
and
a
towel
wet
her
brow
and
face
and
all
the
while
in
an
agony
of
fear
he
talked
to
her
with
words
of
love
overwrought
by
the
unexpected
and
to
him
almost
miraculous
meeting
with
helen
weak
and
shaken
by
the
strain
of
those
moments
of
her
danger
when
her
life
depended
so
wholly
upon
his
coolness
and
skill
unnerved
by
the
sight
of
her
lying
so
still
and
white
and
beside
himself
with
the
strength
of
his
passion
the
man
made
no
effort
to
account
for
her
presence
in
that
wild
and
lonely
spot
so
far
from
the
scenes
amid
which
he
had
learned
to
know
and
love
her
he
was
conscious
only
that
she
was
there
that
she
had
been
very
near
to
death
that
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
and
that
he
loved
her
with
all
the
strength
of
his
manhood
presently
with
a
low
cry
of
joy
he
saw
the
blood
creep
back
into
her
white
cheeks
slowly
her
eyes
opened
and
she
looked
wonderingly
up
into
his
face
helen
he
breathed
helen
why
larry
she
murmured
still
confused
and
wondering
so
it
you
after
all
but
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
like
this
they
told
me
your
name
was
patches
honorable
patches
then
the
man
spoke
impetuously
almost
fiercely
his
words
came
without
thought
i
am
here
because
i
would
be
anything
do
anything
that
a
man
could
be
and
do
to
win
your
love
a
year
ago
when
i
told
you
of
my
love
and
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
and
like
the
silly
pampered
petted
fool
that
i
was
thought
that
my
wealth
and
the
life
that
i
offered
could
count
for
anything
with
a
woman
like
you
you
laughed
at
me
you
told
me
that
if
ever
you
married
you
would
wed
a
man
not
a
fortune
nor
a
social
position
you
made
me
see
myself
as
i
was
a
useless
idler
a
dummy
for
the
tailors
a
superficial
chatterer
of
pretty
nothings
to
vain
and
shallow
women
you
told
me
that
i
possessed
not
one
manly
trait
of
character
that
could
compel
the
genuine
love
of
an
honest
woman
you
let
me
see
the
truth
that
my
proposal
to
you
was
almost
an
insult
you
made
me
understand
that
your
very
friendship
for
me
was
such
a
friendship
as
you
might
have
with
an
amusing
and
irresponsible
boy
or
a
spoiled
child
you
could
not
even
consider
my
love
for
you
seriously
as
a
woman
like
you
must
consider
the
love
of
a
strong
man
and
you
were
right
helen
but
dear
it
was
for
me
a
bitter
bitter
lesson
i
went
from
you
ashamed
to
look
men
in
the
face
i
felt
myself
guilty
a
pitifully
weak
and
cowardly
thing
with
no
right
to
exist
in
my
humiliation
i
ran
from
all
who
knew
me
i
came
out
here
to
escape
from
the
life
that
had
made
me
what
i
was
that
had
robbed
me
of
my
manhood
and
here
by
chance
in
the
contests
at
the
celebration
in
prescott
i
saw
a
man
a
cowboy
who
possessed
everything
that
i
lacked
and
for
the
lack
of
which
you
had
laughed
at
me
and
then
alone
one
night
i
faced
myself
and
fought
it
out
i
knew
that
you
were
right
helen
but
it
was
not
easy
to
give
up
the
habits
and
luxury
to
which
all
my
life
i
had
been
accustomed
it
was
not
easy
i
say
but
my
love
for
you
made
it
a
glorious
thing
to
do
and
i
hoped
and
believed
that
if
i
proved
myself
a
man
i
could
go
back
to
you
in
the
strength
of
my
manhood
and
you
would
listen
to
me
and
so
penniless
and
a
stranger
under
an
assumed
name
i
sought
useful
necessary
work
that
called
for
the
highest
quality
of
manhood
and
i
have
won
helen
i
know
that
i
have
won
patches
the
cowboy
can
look
any
man
in
the
face
he
can
take
his
place
and
hold
his
own
among
men
of
any
class
anywhere
i
have
regained
that
of
which
the
circumstances
of
birth
and
inheritance
and
training
robbed
me
i
have
won
the
right
of
a
man
to
come
to
you
again
i
claim
that
right
now
helen
i
tell
you
again
that
i
love
you
i
love
you
as
larry
larry
she
cried
springing
to
her
feet
and
drawing
away
from
him
as
though
suddenly
awakened
from
some
strange
spell
larry
you
must
not
what
do
you
mean
how
can
you
say
such
things
to
me
he
answered
her
with
reckless
passion
i
say
such
things
because
i
am
a
man
and
because
you
are
the
woman
i
love
and
want
because
she
cried
out
again
in
protest
oh
stop
stop
please
stop
do
you
know
know
what
he
demanded
my
my
husband
she
gasped
stanford
manning
we
are
here
on
our
honeymoon
she
saw
him
flinch
as
though
from
a
heavy
blow
and
put
out
his
hand
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
near
which
they
stood
to
steady
himself
he
did
not
speak
but
his
lips
moved
as
though
he
repeated
her
words
to
himself
over
and
over
again
and
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
strange
bewildered
doubting
look
as
though
he
could
not
believe
his
own
suffering
impulsively
helen
went
a
step
toward
him
larry
she
said
larry
her
voice
seemed
to
arouse
him
and
he
stood
erect
as
though
by
a
conscious
effort
of
will
then
that
old
smile
was
on
his
lips
he
was
laughing
at
his
hurt
making
sport
of
himself
and
his
cruel
predicament
but
to
helen
there
was
that
in
his
smile
which
wrung
her
woman
heart
oh
larry
she
said
gently
forgive
me
i
am
so
sorry
i
he
put
out
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
protest
and
his
voice
was
calm
and
courteous
i
beg
your
pardon
helen
it
was
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
understood
i
forgot
myself
for
the
moment
it
was
all
so
unexpected
meeting
you
like
this
i
did
not
think
he
looked
away
toward
his
waiting
horse
and
to
the
steer
lying
on
the
ground
so
you
and
stanford
manning
good
old
stan
i
am
glad
for
him
and
for
you
too
helen
why
it
was
i
who
introduced
him
to
you
do
you
remember
he
smiled
again
that
mirthless
smile
as
he
added
without
giving
her
time
to
speak
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
moment
i
will
rid
your
camp
of
the
unwelcome
presence
of
that
beast
yonder
then
he
went
toward
his
horse
as
though
turning
for
relief
to
the
work
that
had
become
so
familiar
to
him
she
watched
him
while
he
released
the
steer
and
drove
the
animal
away
over
the
ridge
where
he
permitted
it
to
escape
into
the
wild
haunts
where
it
lived
with
its
outlaw
companions
when
he
rode
back
to
the
little
camp
stanford
had
returned
for
an
hour
they
talked
together
as
old
friends
but
helen
while
she
offered
now
and
then
a
word
or
a
remark
or
asked
a
question
and
laughed
or
smiled
with
them
left
the
talk
mostly
to
the
two
men
stanford
when
the
first
shock
of
learning
of
helen
narrow
escape
was
over
was
gaily
enthusiastic
and
warm
in
his
admiration
for
his
old
friend
who
had
for
no
apparent
reason
but
the
wish
to
assert
his
own
manhood
turned
his
back
upon
the
ease
and
luxury
of
his
wealth
to
live
a
life
of
adventurous
hardship
and
patches
as
he
insisted
they
should
call
him
with
many
a
laughing
jest
and
droll
comment
told
them
of
his
new
life
and
work
he
was
only
serious
when
he
made
them
promise
to
keep
his
identity
a
secret
until
he
himself
was
ready
to
reveal
his
real
name
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
when
your
game
of
patches
is
played
out
stanford
asked
curiously
for
an
instant
they
saw
him
smiling
mockingly
at
himself
then
he
answered
lightly
try
some
other
fool
experiment
i
reckon
stanford
chuckled
the
reply
was
so
like
the
cowboy
patches
and
so
unlike
his
old
friend
larry
knight
as
for
that
stan
patches
continued
i
do
see
that
the
game
will
ever
be
played
out
as
you
say
certainly
i
can
never
now
go
back
altogether
to
what
i
was
the
fellow
you
used
to
know
in
cleveland
is
not
really
i
you
see
fact
is
i
think
that
fellow
is
quite
dead
peace
be
to
his
ashes
the
world
is
wide
and
there
is
always
work
for
a
man
to
do
the
appearance
of
phil
acton
on
the
ridge
at
the
spot
where
the
steer
followed
by
patches
had
first
appeared
put
an
end
to
their
further
conversation
with
lawrence
knight
my
boss
said
that
gentleman
in
his
character
of
patches
the
cowboy
as
the
foreman
halted
his
horse
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
sat
looking
down
upon
the
camp
be
careful
please
and
do
let
him
suspect
that
you
ever
saw
me
before
i
sure
catch
it
now
for
loafing
so
long
i
know
him
said
stanford
then
he
called
to
the
man
above
come
on
down
acton
and
be
sociable
phil
rode
into
camp
shook
hands
with
stanford
cordially
and
was
presented
to
manning
to
whom
he
spoke
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
then
he
said
with
a
significant
look
at
patches
glad
to
meet
you
people
manning
but
we
really
have
much
time
for
sociability
just
now
baldwin
sent
me
with
an
outfit
into
this
granite
basin
country
to
gather
some
of
these
outlaw
steers
he
expects
us
to
be
on
the
job
turning
to
patches
he
continued
when
you
come
back
i
thought
you
must
have
met
with
some
serious
trouble
and
so
trailed
you
we
managed
to
lose
a
good
deal
of
time
altogether
that
steer
you
were
after
got
away
from
you
did
he
helen
spoke
quickly
oh
acton
you
must
not
blame
patches
for
what
happened
really
you
must
not
no
one
was
to
blame
it
just
happened
she
stopped
unable
to
finish
the
explanation
for
she
was
thinking
of
that
part
of
the
incident
which
was
known
only
to
herself
and
patches
stanford
told
in
a
few
words
of
his
wife
danger
and
how
the
cowboy
had
saved
her
that
was
mighty
good
work
patches
said
phil
heartily
mighty
good
work
i
sorry
manning
that
our
coming
up
here
after
these
outlaws
happened
at
just
this
time
it
is
too
bad
to
so
disturb
you
and
manning
we
are
going
home
friday
however
and
i
tell
the
boys
to
keep
clear
of
your
neighborhood
in
the
meantime
as
the
two
men
walked
toward
their
horses
helen
and
stanford
heard
phil
ask
but
where
is
that
steer
patches
i
let
him
go
returned
patches
you
let
him
go
exclaimed
the
foreman
after
you
had
him
roped
and
tied
what
did
you
do
that
for
patches
was
confused
really
i
do
know
i
like
to
know
what
you
figure
we
up
here
for
said
phil
sharply
you
not
only
waste
two
or
three
hours
visiting
with
these
people
but
you
take
my
time
trailing
you
up
and
then
you
turn
loose
a
steer
after
you
get
him
it
looks
like
you
lost
your
head
mighty
bad
after
all
i
afraid
you
right
phil
patches
answered
quietly
helen
looked
at
her
husband
indignantly
but
stanford
was
grinning
with
delight
to
think
he
murmured
of
larry
knight
taking
a
like
that
from
a
mere
cowboy
foreman
but
patches
was
by
no
means
so
meek
in
spirit
as
he
appeared
in
his
outward
manner
he
had
been
driven
almost
to
the
verge
of
desperation
by
the
trying
situation
and
was
fighting
for
to
take
his
foreman
rebuke
in
the
presence
of
his
friends
was
not
easy
i
reckon
i
better
send
you
to
the
home
ranch
instead
of
bob
continued
phil
as
the
two
men
mounted
their
horses
and
sat
for
a
moment
facing
each
other
it
looks
like
we
could
spare
you
best
tell
uncle
will
to
send
the
chuck
wagon
and
three
more
punchers
and
that
we
start
for
the
home
ranch
friday
and
be
sure
that
you
get
back
here
shall
i
go
now
yes
you
can
go
now
patches
wheeled
his
horse
and
rode
away
while
phil
disappeared
over
the
ridge
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
when
the
two
cowboys
were
out
of
sight
helen
went
straight
to
her
husband
and
to
stanford
consternation
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
she
was
crying
why
girl
what
is
it
he
asked
holding
her
close
but
she
only
answered
between
sobs
as
she
clung
to
him
it
nothing
never
mind
stan
i
just
upset
and
stanford
quite
naturally
thought
it
was
only
a
case
of
nerves
caused
by
the
danger
through
which
she
had
passed
for
nearly
an
hour
patches
rode
toward
the
home
ranch
taking
only
such
notice
of
his
surroundings
as
was
necessary
in
order
for
him
to
keep
his
direction
through
the
brush
and
timber
over
the
ridges
down
into
valleys
and
washes
and
along
the
mountain
sides
he
allowed
his
horse
to
pick
the
way
and
take
his
own
gait
with
scarcely
a
touch
of
rein
or
spur
the
twilight
hour
was
beginning
when
he
reached
a
point
from
which
he
could
see
in
the
distance
the
red
roofs
of
the
buildings
checking
his
horse
he
sat
for
a
long
time
motionless
looking
away
over
the
broad
land
that
had
come
to
mean
so
much
to
him
as
though
watching
the
passing
of
the
day
but
the
man
did
not
note
the
changing
colors
in
the
western
sky
he
did
not
see
the
shadows
deepening
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
coming
of
the
night
the
sight
of
the
distant
spot
that
a
year
before
had
held
such
possibilities
for
him
when
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
he
had
chosen
between
two
widely
separated
ways
of
life
brought
to
him
now
a
keener
realization
of
the
fact
that
he
was
again
placed
where
he
must
choose
the
sun
was
down
upon
those
hopes
and
dreams
that
in
the
first
hard
weeks
of
his
testing
had
inspired
and
strengthened
him
the
night
of
despairing
reckless
abandonment
of
the
very
ideals
of
manhood
for
which
he
had
so
bravely
struggled
was
upon
him
while
the
spirit
and
strength
of
that
manhood
which
he
had
so
hardly
attained
fought
against
its
surrender
when
stanford
manning
had
asked
what
will
you
do
when
your
game
of
patches
is
played
out
he
had
said
that
the
man
whom
they
had
known
in
the
old
days
was
dead
would
this
new
man
also
die
deliberately
the
man
turned
about
and
started
back
the
way
he
had
come
in
their
honeymoon
camp
that
evening
when
the
only
light
in
the
sky
was
the
light
of
the
stars
and
the
camp
fire
ruddy
flames
made
weird
shadows
come
and
go
in
the
little
glade
helen
lying
in
the
hammock
and
stanford
sitting
near
talked
of
their
old
friend
lawrence
knight
but
as
they
talked
they
did
not
know
that
a
lonely
horseman
had
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
low
ridge
and
leaving
his
horse
had
crept
carefully
through
the
brush
to
a
point
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
from
which
he
could
look
down
into
the
camp
from
where
he
lay
in
the
darkness
the
man
could
see
against
the
camp
fire
light
the
two
where
the
hammock
was
swung
under
the
trees
he
could
hear
the
low
murmur
of
their
voices
with
now
and
then
a
laugh
but
it
was
always
the
man
who
laughed
for
there
was
little
mirth
in
helen
heart
that
night
then
he
saw
stanford
go
into
the
tent
and
return
again
to
the
hammock
and
soon
there
came
floating
up
to
him
the
sweet
plaintive
music
of
helen
guitar
and
then
her
voice
full
and
low
with
a
wealth
of
womanhood
in
every
tone
as
she
sang
a
love
song
to
her
mate
later
when
the
dancing
flames
of
the
camp
fire
had
fallen
to
a
dull
red
glow
he
saw
them
go
arm
in
arm
into
their
tent
then
all
was
still
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
dimmed
to
a
spark
and
darkness
drew
close
about
the
scene
but
even
in
the
darkness
the
man
could
still
see
under
the
wide
sheltering
arms
of
the
trees
a
lighter
spot
the
white
tent
gethsemane
said
the
dean
to
me
once
when
our
talk
had
ranged
wide
and
touched
upon
many
things
gethsemane
ai
no
place
it
that
happens
whenever
a
man
goes
up
against
himself
right
there
is
where
gethsemane
is
and
right
there
too
is
sure
to
be
a
fight
a
man
may
not
always
know
about
it
at
the
time
he
may
be
too
busy
fightin
to
understand
just
what
it
all
means
but
he
know
about
it
afterwards
no
matter
which
side
of
him
wins
he
know
afterwards
that
it
was
the
one
big
fight
of
his
life
chapter
xiv
at
mint
spring
when
those
days
at
prescott
were
over
and
and
manning
had
left
for
their
camp
in
granite
basin
kitty
reid
returned
to
williamson
valley
reluctantly
she
felt
that
with
phil
definitely
out
of
her
life
the
last
interest
that
bound
her
to
the
scenes
of
her
girlhood
was
broken
before
many
weeks
the
ranch
would
be
sold
a
prescott
agent
had
opened
negotiations
for
an
eastern
client
who
would
soon
be
out
to
look
over
the
property
and
reid
felt
from
all
that
the
agent
had
said
that
the
sale
was
assured
in
the
meantime
kitty
would
wait
as
patiently
as
she
could
to
help
her
there
would
be
helen
visit
and
there
was
her
friendship
with
professor
parkhill
it
was
not
strange
considering
all
the
circumstances
that
the
young
woman
should
give
her
time
more
generously
than
ever
to
the
only
person
in
the
neighborhood
except
patches
perhaps
who
she
felt
could
understand
and
appreciate
her
desires
for
that
higher
life
of
which
even
her
own
parents
were
ignorant
and
the
professor
did
understand
her
fully
he
told
her
so
many
times
each
day
had
he
not
given
all
the
years
of
his
little
life
to
the
study
of
those
refining
and
spiritualizing
truths
that
are
so
far
above
the
comprehension
of
the
base
and
ignoble
common
herd
indeed
he
understood
her
language
he
understood
fully
why
the
sordid
brutal
materialism
of
her
crude
and
uncultured
environment
so
repulsed
and
disgusted
her
he
understood
more
fully
than
kitty
herself
in
fact
and
explained
to
her
clearly
that
her
desires
for
the
higher
intellectual
and
spiritual
life
were
born
of
her
own
rare
gifts
and
evidenced
beyond
all
question
the
fineness
and
delicacy
of
her
nature
he
rejoiced
with
her
with
a
pure
and
holy
joy
that
she
was
so
soon
to
be
set
free
to
live
amid
the
surroundings
that
would
afford
her
those
opportunities
for
the
higher
development
of
her
intellectual
and
spiritual
powers
which
her
soul
craved
all
this
he
told
her
from
day
to
day
and
then
one
afternoon
he
told
her
more
it
was
the
same
afternoon
that
patches
had
so
unexpectedly
found
helen
and
stanford
in
their
granite
basin
camp
kitty
and
the
professor
had
driven
in
the
buckboard
to
simmons
for
the
mail
and
were
coming
back
by
the
road
to
the
when
the
man
asked
must
we
return
to
the
ranch
so
soon
it
is
so
delightful
out
here
where
there
is
no
one
to
intrude
with
vulgar
commonplaces
to
mar
our
companionship
why
no
returned
kitty
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
hurry
home
she
glanced
around
we
might
sit
over
there
under
those
cedars
on
the
hill
where
you
found
me
with
patches
that
day
the
day
we
saw
yavapai
joe
you
remember
if
you
think
it
quite
safe
to
leave
the
vehicle
he
said
i
should
be
delighted
kitty
tied
the
horses
to
a
convenient
bush
at
the
foot
of
the
low
hill
and
soon
they
were
in
the
welcome
shade
of
the
cedars
miss
reid
the
professor
began
with
portentous
gravity
i
must
confess
that
i
have
been
rather
puzzled
to
account
for
your
presence
here
that
day
with
such
a
man
as
that
fellow
patches
you
will
pardon
my
saying
so
i
am
sure
but
you
must
have
observed
my
very
deep
interest
in
you
i
also
chanced
to
see
you
with
him
one
day
in
prescott
in
the
park
you
do
mind
my
speaking
of
it
not
at
all
professor
parkhill
kitty
returned
smiling
as
she
thought
how
ignorant
the
professor
was
of
the
cowboy
real
character
i
like
patches
he
interests
me
very
much
and
there
is
really
no
reason
why
i
should
not
be
friendly
with
him
do
you
think
that
i
should
be
kind
to
our
cowboys
i
suppose
so
the
professor
sighed
but
it
hurts
me
to
see
you
have
anything
whatever
in
common
with
such
a
man
it
shocks
me
to
know
that
you
must
in
any
degree
come
in
touch
with
such
fellows
i
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
when
you
are
free
from
any
such
kindly
obligations
and
safe
among
those
of
your
own
class
kitty
found
it
very
hard
to
reply
she
did
not
wish
to
be
disloyal
to
patches
and
her
many
williamson
valley
friends
nor
did
she
like
to
explain
how
patches
had
played
a
part
for
the
professor
benefit
for
she
felt
that
by
not
exposing
the
deception
she
had
in
a
way
been
a
party
to
it
so
she
said
nothing
but
seemed
to
be
silently
weighing
the
value
of
her
learned
companion
observations
at
least
it
so
appeared
to
the
professor
and
in
her
ready
acceptance
of
his
implied
criticism
of
her
conduct
he
found
the
encouragement
he
needed
for
that
which
followed
you
must
understand
miss
reid
that
i
have
become
exceedingly
zealous
for
your
welfare
in
these
months
that
we
have
been
so
much
together
your
companionship
your
spiritual
and
intellectual
companionship
i
should
say
has
come
to
be
very
dear
to
me
as
our
souls
have
communed
i
have
felt
myself
uplifted
and
inspired
i
have
been
strengthened
and
encouraged
as
never
before
to
climb
on
toward
the
mountain
peaks
of
pure
intellectuality
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
too
have
felt
a
degree
of
uplift
as
a
result
of
our
fellowship
have
you
not
yes
indeed
professor
parkhill
kitty
answered
sincerely
our
talks
together
have
meant
much
more
to
me
than
i
can
tell
i
shall
never
forget
this
summer
your
friendship
has
been
a
wonderful
influence
in
my
life
the
little
man
moved
uneasily
and
glanced
timidly
around
i
am
truly
glad
to
know
that
our
companionship
has
not
been
altogether
distasteful
to
you
i
felt
sure
that
it
was
not
but
i
ahem
i
am
glad
to
hear
your
confirmation
of
my
opinion
it
ah
it
enables
me
to
say
that
which
for
several
weeks
past
has
been
weighing
heavily
on
my
mind
kitty
looked
at
him
with
the
manner
of
a
trusting
disciple
waiting
for
the
gems
of
truth
that
were
about
to
fall
from
the
lips
of
a
venerable
teacher
miss
reid
ah
why
need
our
beautiful
and
mutually
profitable
companionship
cease
i
fear
that
i
do
not
understand
professor
parkhill
she
answered
puzzled
by
his
question
he
looked
at
her
with
just
a
shade
of
mild
very
mild
rebuke
as
he
returned
why
i
think
that
i
have
stated
my
thought
clearly
i
mean
that
i
am
very
desirous
that
our
relation
the
relation
which
we
both
have
found
so
helpful
should
continue
i
am
sure
that
we
have
in
these
months
which
we
have
spent
together
sufficient
evidence
that
our
souls
vibrate
in
perfect
harmony
i
need
you
dear
friend
your
understanding
of
my
soul
desires
is
so
sympathetic
i
feel
that
you
so
complement
and
fill
out
as
it
were
my
spiritual
self
i
need
you
to
encourage
to
inspire
to
assist
me
in
the
noble
work
to
which
i
am
devoting
all
my
strength
she
looked
at
him
now
with
an
expression
of
amazement
do
you
mean
she
faltered
in
confusion
while
the
red
blood
colored
her
cheeks
yes
he
answered
confidently
i
am
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
not
however
he
added
hastily
in
the
common
vulgar
understanding
of
that
relation
i
am
offering
you
dear
friend
that
which
is
vastly
higher
than
the
union
of
the
merely
animal
which
is
based
wholly
upon
the
purely
physical
and
material
attraction
i
am
proposing
marriage
of
our
souls
a
union
if
you
please
of
our
higher
intellectual
and
spiritual
selves
i
feel
indeed
that
by
those
higher
laws
which
the
vulgar
beastlike
minds
are
incapable
of
recognizing
we
are
already
one
i
sense
as
it
were
that
oneness
which
can
exist
only
when
two
souls
are
mated
by
the
great
i
feel
that
you
are
already
mine
that
i
am
that
we
are
already
united
in
a
spiritual
union
that
is
the
young
woman
checked
him
with
a
gesture
which
had
he
interpreted
it
rightly
was
one
of
repulsion
please
stop
professor
parkhill
she
gasped
in
a
tone
of
disgust
he
was
surprised
and
not
a
little
chagrined
am
i
to
understand
that
you
do
not
reciprocate
my
sentiment
miss
reid
is
it
possible
that
i
have
been
so
mistaken
kitty
turned
her
head
as
though
she
could
not
bear
even
to
look
at
him
what
you
ask
is
so
impossible
she
said
in
a
low
tone
impossible
strive
as
she
might
the
young
woman
could
not
altogether
hide
her
feeling
of
abhorrence
and
yet
she
asked
herself
why
should
this
proposal
arouse
in
her
such
antagonism
and
repugnance
he
was
a
scholar
famed
for
his
attainments
in
the
world
of
the
highest
culture
as
his
wife
she
would
be
admitted
at
once
into
the
very
inner
circle
of
that
life
to
which
she
aspired
and
for
which
she
was
leaving
her
old
home
and
friends
he
had
couched
his
proposal
in
the
very
terms
of
the
spiritually
and
intellectually
elect
he
had
declared
himself
in
that
language
which
she
had
so
proudly
thought
she
understood
and
in
which
she
had
so
often
talked
with
him
and
yet
she
was
humiliated
and
ashamed
it
was
to
her
as
though
in
placing
his
offer
of
marriage
upon
the
high
pure
ground
of
a
spiritual
union
he
had
insulted
her
womanhood
kitty
realized
wonderingly
that
she
had
not
felt
like
this
when
phil
had
confessed
his
love
for
her
in
her
woman
heart
she
was
proud
and
glad
to
have
won
the
love
of
such
a
man
as
phil
even
though
she
could
not
accept
the
cowboy
as
her
mate
on
that
very
spot
which
the
professor
had
chosen
for
his
declaration
patches
had
told
her
that
she
was
leaving
the
glorious
and
enduring
realities
of
life
for
vain
and
foolish
bubbles
that
she
was
throwing
aside
the
good
grain
and
choosing
the
husks
was
this
what
patches
meant
she
wondered
i
regret
exceedingly
miss
reid
the
professor
was
saying
that
the
pure
and
lofty
sentiments
which
i
have
voiced
do
not
seem
to
find
a
like
response
in
your
soul
i
again
she
interrupted
him
with
that
gesture
of
repulsion
please
do
not
say
any
more
professor
parkhill
i
i
fear
that
i
am
very
human
after
all
come
it
is
time
that
we
were
returning
to
the
house
all
through
the
remaining
hours
of
that
afternoon
and
evening
kitty
was
disturbed
and
troubled
at
times
she
wanted
to
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
proposal
and
again
her
cheeks
burned
with
anger
and
she
could
have
cried
in
her
shame
and
humiliation
and
with
it
all
her
mind
was
distraught
by
the
persistent
question
was
not
the
conception
of
an
ideal
mating
the
legitimate
and
logical
conclusion
of
those
very
advanced
ideas
of
culture
which
he
represented
and
which
she
had
so
much
admired
if
she
sincerely
believed
the
life
represented
by
the
professor
and
his
kind
so
superior
so
far
above
the
life
represented
by
phil
acton
why
should
she
not
feel
honored
instead
of
being
so
humiliated
and
shamed
by
the
professor
she
could
not
call
it
love
if
the
life
which
phil
had
asked
her
to
share
was
so
low
in
the
scale
of
civilization
if
it
were
so
far
beneath
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
ideals
which
she
had
formed
why
did
she
feel
so
honored
by
the
strong
man
love
why
had
she
not
felt
humiliated
and
ashamed
that
phil
should
want
her
to
mate
with
him
could
it
be
she
asked
herself
again
and
again
that
there
was
something
after
all
superior
to
that
culture
which
she
had
so
truly
thought
stood
for
the
highest
ideals
of
the
race
could
it
be
that
in
the
land
of
granite
mountain
there
was
something
after
all
that
was
as
superior
to
the
things
she
had
been
taught
as
granite
mountain
itself
was
superior
in
its
primeval
strength
and
enduring
grandeur
to
the
buildings
of
her
school
it
was
not
strange
that
kitty
troubled
thoughts
should
turn
to
helen
manning
clearly
helen
education
had
led
to
no
confusion
on
the
contrary
she
had
found
an
ideal
love
and
a
happiness
such
as
every
true
womanly
woman
must
in
her
heart
of
hearts
desire
it
was
far
into
the
night
when
kitty
wakeful
and
restless
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
feet
she
could
not
know
that
it
was
honorable
patches
riding
past
on
his
way
to
the
ranch
on
the
other
side
of
the
broad
valley
meadows
weary
in
body
and
with
mind
and
spirit
exhausted
by
the
trials
through
which
he
had
passed
patches
crept
to
his
bed
in
the
morning
when
he
delivered
his
message
the
dean
seeing
the
man
face
urged
him
to
stay
for
the
day
at
the
ranch
but
patches
said
no
phil
was
expecting
him
and
he
must
return
to
the
outfit
in
granite
basin
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
he
set
out
he
had
ridden
as
far
as
the
head
of
mint
wash
and
had
stopped
to
water
his
horse
and
to
refresh
himself
with
a
cool
drink
and
a
brief
rest
beside
the
fragrant
spring
when
he
heard
someone
riding
rapidly
up
the
wash
the
way
he
had
come
a
moment
later
kitty
riding
her
favorite
midnight
rounded
a
jutting
corner
of
the
rocky
wall
of
the
bluff
as
the
girl
caught
sight
of
him
there
beside
the
spring
she
waved
her
hand
in
greeting
and
the
man
as
he
waved
his
answer
and
watched
her
riding
toward
him
felt
a
thrill
of
gladness
that
she
had
come
the
strong
true
friendship
that
began
with
their
very
first
meeting
when
she
had
been
so
frankly
interested
in
the
tenderfoot
and
so
kindly
helpful
and
which
had
developed
so
steadily
through
the
year
gave
him
now
a
feeling
of
comfort
and
relief
wearied
and
worn
by
his
disappointment
and
by
his
struggle
with
himself
with
the
cherished
hope
that
had
enabled
him
to
choose
and
endure
the
hard
life
of
the
range
brought
to
a
sudden
end
with
his
life
itself
made
so
empty
and
futile
he
welcomed
his
woman
friend
with
a
warmth
and
gladness
that
brought
a
flush
of
pleasure
to
kitty
cheek
for
kitty
too
had
just
passed
through
a
humiliating
and
disappointing
experience
in
her
troubled
frame
of
mind
and
in
her
perplexed
and
confused
questioning
the
young
woman
was
as
glad
for
the
companionship
of
patches
as
he
was
glad
to
welcome
her
she
felt
a
curious
sense
of
relief
and
safety
in
his
presence
somewhat
as
one
who
walking
over
uncertain
bogs
or
treacherous
quicksands
finds
all
at
once
the
solid
ground
i
saw
you
go
past
the
house
she
said
when
she
reached
the
spring
where
he
stood
awaiting
her
and
i
decided
right
then
that
i
would
go
along
with
you
to
granite
basin
and
visit
my
friends
the
mannings
they
told
me
that
i
might
come
this
week
and
i
think
they
have
had
quite
enough
honeymooning
anyway
you
know
where
they
are
camped
do
you
yes
he
answered
i
saw
them
yesterday
but
come
get
down
and
cool
off
a
bit
you
been
riding
some
have
you
i
wanted
to
catch
you
as
soon
as
i
could
she
laughed
as
she
sprang
lightly
to
the
ground
and
you
see
you
gained
a
good
start
while
i
was
getting
midnight
saddled
what
a
pretty
spot
i
must
have
a
drink
of
that
water
this
minute
sorry
i
have
no
cup
he
said
and
then
he
laughed
with
the
pleasure
of
good
comradeship
as
she
answered
you
forget
that
i
was
born
to
the
customs
of
this
country
and
throwing
aside
her
broad
hat
she
went
down
on
the
ground
to
drink
from
the
spring
even
as
he
had
done
as
the
man
watched
her
a
sudden
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
a
thought
so
startling
so
unexpected
that
he
was
for
the
moment
bewildered
talk
about
the
nectar
of
the
gods
cried
kitty
with
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
as
she
lifted
her
smiling
face
from
the
bright
water
to
look
up
at
him
and
then
she
drank
again
and
now
if
you
please
sir
you
may
bring
me
some
of
that
we
sit
over
there
in
the
shade
and
who
cares
whether
granite
basin
the
mannings
and
your
fellow
are
fifteen
or
fifty
miles
away
he
brought
a
generous
bunch
of
the
and
stretched
himself
full
length
beside
her
as
she
sat
on
the
ground
under
a
tall
sycamore
selah
he
laughed
contentedly
we
seem
to
lack
only
the
book
of
verses
the
loaf
and
the
jug
the
wilderness
is
here
all
right
and
that
a
perfectly
good
bough
up
there
and
of
course
you
could
furnish
the
song
i
might
recite
boy
stood
on
the
burning
deck
but
alas
we
have
even
a
flask
and
biscuit
what
a
pity
that
you
should
be
so
near
and
yet
so
far
from
paradise
she
retorted
quickly
then
she
added
with
a
mischievous
smile
it
just
happens
that
i
have
a
sandwich
in
my
saddle
pocket
wo
you
sing
please
do
he
returned
with
an
eagerness
that
amused
her
but
she
shook
her
head
reprovingly
we
would
still
lack
the
jug
of
wine
you
know
and
really
i
do
think
that
paradise
is
for
anyway
do
you
evidently
not
he
answered
and
at
her
jesting
words
a
queer
feeling
of
rebellion
possessed
him
why
should
he
be
condemned
to
years
of
loneliness
why
must
he
face
a
life
without
the
companionship
of
a
mate
if
the
paradise
he
had
sought
so
hard
to
attain
were
denied
him
why
should
he
not
still
take
what
happiness
he
might
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
his
hands
clasped
beneath
his
head
watching
an
eagle
that
wheeled
a
tiny
black
speck
high
under
the
blue
arch
of
the
sky
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
companion
kitty
leaned
toward
him
and
held
a
sprig
of
over
his
upturned
face
i
have
a
penny
she
said
but
i
give
you
this
he
sat
up
quickly
even
at
that
price
my
thoughts
might
cost
you
too
much
but
you
have
told
me
what
you
have
done
with
our
dear
friend
the
professor
have
you
a
guilty
conscience
deserting
him
like
this
kitty
held
up
both
hands
in
a
gesture
of
dismay
do
patches
please
do
ugh
if
you
only
knew
how
good
it
is
to
be
with
a
again
he
laughed
aloud
in
a
spirit
of
reckless
defiance
and
phil
is
over
in
granite
basin
i
neglected
to
tell
you
that
he
knows
the
location
of
the
mannings
camp
as
well
as
i
kitty
was
a
little
puzzled
by
the
tone
of
his
laughter
and
by
his
words
she
spoke
gravely
perhaps
i
should
tell
you
patches
we
have
been
such
good
friends
you
and
i
phil
yes
he
said
phil
is
nothing
to
me
patches
i
mean
you
mean
in
the
way
he
wanted
to
be
he
helped
her
with
a
touch
of
eager
readiness
yes
and
have
you
told
him
kitty
patches
asked
gently
yes
i
have
told
him
she
replied
patches
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
poor
phil
he
said
softly
i
understand
now
i
thought
that
was
it
he
is
a
man
among
thousands
kitty
i
know
i
know
she
returned
as
though
to
dismiss
the
subject
but
it
simply
could
be
patches
was
looking
at
her
intently
with
an
expression
in
his
dark
eyes
that
kitty
had
never
before
seen
the
man
mind
was
in
a
whirl
of
quick
excitement
as
they
had
talked
and
laughed
together
the
thought
that
had
so
startled
him
when
her
manner
of
familiar
comradeship
had
brought
such
a
feeling
of
comfort
to
his
troubled
spirit
had
not
left
him
from
that
first
moment
of
their
meeting
a
year
before
there
had
been
that
feeling
between
them
of
companionship
a
feeling
which
had
grown
as
their
acquaintance
had
developed
into
the
intimate
friendship
that
had
allowed
him
to
speak
to
her
as
he
had
spoken
that
day
under
the
cedars
on
the
ridge
what
might
that
friendship
not
grow
into
he
thought
of
her
desire
for
the
life
that
he
knew
so
well
and
how
he
could
while
granting
every
wish
of
her
heart
yet
protect
her
from
the
shams
and
falseness
and
with
these
thoughts
was
that
feeling
of
rebellion
against
the
loneliness
of
his
life
kitty
words
regarding
phil
removed
the
barrier
as
it
were
and
the
man
nature
which
prompted
him
so
often
to
act
without
pausing
to
consider
betrayed
him
into
saying
would
you
be
greatly
shocked
kitty
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
am
glad
that
while
i
am
sorry
for
phil
i
am
glad
that
you
have
said
no
to
him
you
are
glad
she
said
wonderingly
why
because
now
am
free
to
say
what
i
could
not
have
said
had
you
not
told
me
what
you
have
i
want
you
kitty
i
want
to
fill
your
life
with
beauty
and
happiness
and
contentment
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
to
see
and
know
the
natural
wonders
of
the
world
and
the
wonders
that

have
wrought
i
want
to
surround
you
with
the
beauties
of
art
and
literature
with
everything
that
your
heart
craves
i
want
you
to
know
the
people
whose
friendship
would
be
a
delight
to
you
come
with
me

my
wife
and
together
we
will
find
if
not
paradise
at
least
a
full
and
useful
and
contented
and
happy
life
will
you
come
kitty
will
you
come
with
me
as
she
listened
her
eyes
grew
big
with
wonder
and
delight
it
was
as
though
some
good
genie
had
suddenly
opened
wide
the
way
to
an
enchanted
laud
then
the
gladness
went
swiftly
from
her
face
and
she
said
doubtingly
you
are
jesting
with
me
patches
as
she
spoke
his
cowboy
name
the
man
laughed
aloud
i
forgot
that
you
do
not
even
know
me
i
mean
that
you
do
not
know
my
name
are
you
some
fairy
prince
in
disguise
sir
patches
not
a
fairy
dear
and
certainly
not
a
prince
just
a
man
that
all
but
a
man
dear
girl
who
can
offer
you
a
clean
life
an
honored
name
and
all
of
which
i
have
spoken
but
i
must
tell
you
i
always
knew
that
i
would
tell
you
some
day
but
i
did
not
dream
that
it
would
be
my
name
is
lawrence
knight
my
home
is
in
cleveland
ohio
your
father
can
easily
satisfy
himself
as
to
my
family
and
my
own
personal
life
and
standing
it
is
enough
for
me
to
assure
you
now
dear
that
i
am
abundantly
able
to
give
you
all
that
i
have
promised
at
the
mention
of
his
name
kitty
eyes
grew
bright
again
thanks
to
her
intimate
friend
and
schoolmate
helen
manning
she
knew
much
more
of
lawrence
knight
than
that
gentleman
supposed
but
tell
me
she
asked
curiously
trembling
with
suppressed
excitement
why
is
lawrence
knight
masquerading
here
as
the
cowboy
honorable
patches
he
answered
earnestly
i
know
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
dear
but
the
simple
truth
is
that
i
became
ashamed
of
myself
and
my
life
of
idle
uselessness
i
determined
to
see
if
i
could
take
my
place
among
men
simply
as
a
man
i
wanted
to
be
accepted
by
men
for
myself
for
my
manhood
if
you
like
and
not
because
of
my
he
hesitated
then
said
frankly
my
money
and
social
position
i
wanted
to
depend
upon
myself
to
live
as
other
men
live
by
my
own
strength
and
courage
and
work
if
i
had
given
my
real
name
when
i
asked
for
work
at
the
someone
would
have
found
me
out
before
very
long
and
my
little
experiment
would
have
failed
do
you
see
while
he
spoke
kitty
excited
mind
had
caught
at
many
thoughts
she
believed
sincerely
that
her
girlhood
love
for
phil
was
dead
this
man
even
as
patches
the
cowboy
with
a
questionable
shadow
on
his
life
had
compelled
her
respect
and
confidence
while
in
his
evident
education
and
social
culture
he
had
won
her
deepest
admiration
she
felt
that
he
was
all
that
phil
was
and
more
there
was
in
her
feeling
toward
him
as
he
offered
himself
to
her
now
no
hint
of
that
instinctive
repulsion
and
abhorrence
with
which
she
had
received
professor
parkhill
declaration
of
spiritual
affinity
her
recent
experience
with
the
master
of
aesthetics
had
so
outraged
her
womanly
instincts
that
the
inevitable
reaction
from
her
perplexed
and
troubled
mind
led
her
to
feel
more
deeply
and
to
be
drawn
more
strongly
toward
this
man
with
whom
any
woman
might
be
proud
to
mate
at
the
same
time
the
attractions
of
the
life
which
she
knew
he
could
give
her
and
for
which
she
longed
so
passionately
with
the
relief
of
the
thought
that
her
parents
would
not
need
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
her
were
potent
factors
in
the
power
of
lawrence
knight
appeal
it
would
be
wonderful
she
said
musingly
i
have
dreamed
and
dreamed
about
such
things
you
will
come
with
me
dear
you
will
let
me
give
you
your
wish
you
will
go
with
me
into
the
life
for
which
you
are
so
fitted
do
you
really
want
me
patches
she
asked
timidly
as
though
in
her
mind
there
was
still
a
shadow
of
doubt
more
than
anything
in
the
world
he
urged
say
yes
kitty
say
that
you
will
be
my
wife
the
answer
came
softly
with
a
hint
of
questioning
still
yes
kitty
did
not
notice
that
the
man
had
not
spoken
of
his
love
for
her
there
were
so
many
other
things
for
her
to
consider
so
many
other
things
to
distract
her
mind
nor
did
the
man
notice
that
kitty
herself
had
failed
to
speak
in
any
way
that
little
word
which
rightly
understood
holds
in
its
fullest
deepest
meaning
all
of
happiness
of
labor
and
accomplishment
of
success
and
triumph
of
sacrifice
and
sorrow
holds
in
its
fullest
deepest
meaning
indeed
all
of
life
itself
chapter
xv
on
cedar
ridge
kitty
friends
were
very
glad
to
welcome
her
at
their
camp
in
granite
basin
the
incident
which
had
so
rudely
broken
the
seclusion
of
their
honeymoon
had
been
too
nearly
a
tragedy
to
be
easily
forgotten
the
charm
of
the
place
was
in
some
degree
for
them
lost
and
coming
helped
to
dispel
the
cloud
that
had
a
little
overshadowed
those
last
days
of
their
outing
it
was
not
at
all
difficult
for
them
to
persuade
kitty
to
remain
longer
than
the
one
night
that
she
had
planned
and
to
accompany
them
to
prescott
prom
prescott
stanford
must
go
to
the
mines
to
take
up
his
work
and
to
arrange
for
helen
coming
later
and
helen
would
go
home
with
kitty
for
the
visit
she
had
promised
the
cowboys
who
were
returning
to
the
ranch
would
take
kitty
horse
to
her
home
and
would
carry
a
message
explaining
the
young
woman
absence
and
asking
that
someone
be
sent
to
prescott
with
the
clothing
she
would
need
in
town
and
that
the
reid
automobile
might
be
in
prescott
in
readiness
to
take
the
two
young
women
back
to
the
ranch
on
the
appointed
day
kitty
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
even
helen
about
her
engagement
to
lawrence
knight
or
patches
as
she
would
continue
to
call
him
until
the
time
came
for
the
cowboy
himself
to
make
his
true
name
and
character
known
it
had
all
happened
so
suddenly
the
promises
of
the
future
were
so
wonderful
so
far
beyond
the
young
woman
fondest
dreams
that
she
herself
could
scarcely
realize
the
truth
there
would
be
time
enough
to
tell
helen
when
they
were
together
at
the
ranch
and
she
was
insistent
too
that
patches
must
not
interview
her
father
until
she
herself
had
returned
home
phil
and
his
cowboys
with
the
cattle
reached
the
corrals
the
evening
before
the
day
set
for
kitty
and
helen
to
arrive
at
the
ranch
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
meadows
the
men
were
greeted
by
the
news
that
professor
parkhill
had
said
to
williamson
valley
and
that
the
ranch
had
been
sold
the
eastern
purchaser
expected
by
reid
had
arrived
on
the
day
that
kitty
had
gone
to
granite
basin
and
the
deal
had
been
closed
without
delay
but
reid
was
not
to
give
possession
of
the
property
until
after
the
fall
rodeo
as
the
men
sat
under
the
walnut
trees
with
the
dean
that
evening
discussing
the
incidents
of
the
granite
basin
work
and
speculating
about
the
new
owner
of
the
neighboring
ranch
phil
sat
with
little
billy
apart
from
the
circle
and
contributed
to
the
conversation
only
now
and
then
a
word
or
a
brief
answer
to
some
question
when
baldwin
persuaded
the
child
that
it
was
bedtime
phil
slipped
quietly
away
in
the
darkness
and
they
did
not
see
him
again
until
breakfast
the
next
morning
when
breakfast
was
over
the
foreman
gave
a
few
directions
to
his
men
and
rode
away
alone
the
dean
understanding
the
lad
whom
he
loved
as
one
of
his
own
sons
watched
him
go
without
a
word
or
a
question
to
baldwin
he
said
just
let
him
alone
stella
the
boy
is
all
right
he
only
gone
off
somewhere
on
the
range
to
fight
it
out
alone
most
likely
he
put
in
the
day
watching
those
wild
horses
over
beyond
toohey
he
generally
goes
to
them
when
he
bothered
about
anything
or
in
trouble
of
any
sort
patches
who
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
of
some
kind
to
fair
oaks
was
returning
home
early
in
the
afternoon
and
had
reached
the
neighborhood
of
that
spring
where
he
had
first
encountered
nick
cambert
when
he
heard
a
calf
bawling
lustily
somewhere
in
the
cedar
timber
not
far
away
familiar
as
he
now
was
with
the
voices
of
the
range
the
cowboy
knew
that
the
calf
was
in
trouble
the
call
was
one
of
fright
and
pain
turning
aside
from
his
course
he
rode
rapidly
at
first
then
more
cautiously
toward
the
sound
presently
he
caught
a
whiff
of
smoke
that
came
with
the
light
breeze
from
somewhere
ahead
on
the
ridge
along
which
he
was
riding
instantly
he
rode
into
a
thick
clump
of
cedars
and
dismounting
tied
his
horse
then
he
went
on
carefully
and
silently
on
foot
soon
he
heard
voices
again
the
calf
bawled
in
fright
and
pain
and
the
familiar
odor
of
burning
hair
was
carried
to
him
on
the
breeze
someone
was
branding
a
calf
it
might
be
all
right
it
might
not
patches
was
unarmed
but
with
characteristic
disregard
of
consequences
he
crept
softly
forward
toward
a
dense
growth
of
trees
and
brush
from
beyond
which
the
noise
and
the
smoke
seemed
to
come
he
had
barely
gained
the
cover
when
he
heard
someone
on
the
other
side
ride
rapidly
away
down
the
ridge
hastily
parting
the
bushes
he
looked
through
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
horseman
but
he
was
a
moment
too
late
the
rider
had
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
timber
but
in
a
little
open
space
among
the
cedars
the
cowboy
saw
yavapai
joe
standing
beside
a
calf
with
the
iron
and
earmarked
with
the
tailholt
marks
patches
knew
instantly
as
well
as
though
he
had
witnessed
the
actual
branding
what
had
happened
that
part
of
the
range
was
seldom
visited
except
by
the
dean
cowboys
and
the
tailholt
mountain
men
knowing
that
the
riders
were
all
at
granite
basin
were
making
good
use
of
their
opportunities
the
man
who
had
ridden
away
so
hurriedly
a
moment
too
soon
for
patches
to
see
him
was
without
doubt
driving
the
mother
of
the
calf
to
a
distance
that
would
effectually
separate
her
from
her
offspring
but
while
he
was
so
sure
in
his
own
mind
the
man
as
it
had
so
often
happened
before
had
arrived
on
the
scene
too
late
he
had
no
positive
evidence
that
the
animal
just
branded
was
not
the
lawful
property
of
nick
cambert
as
patches
stepped
from
the
bushes
yavapai
joe
faced
him
for
a
moment
in
guilty
astonishment
and
fear
then
he
ran
toward
his
horse
wait
a
minute
joe
called
patches
what
good
will
it
do
for
you
to
run
now
i
not
going
to
harm
you
joe
stopped
and
stood
hesitating
in
indecision
watching
the
intruder
with
that
sneaking
sidewise
look
come
on
joe
let
have
a
little
talk
about
this
business
the
man
said
in
a
tone
as
he
seated
himself
on
a
large
stone
near
the
little
fire
you
know
you
get
away
so
you
might
as
well
i
ai
tellin
nothin
to
nobody
said
joe
sullenly
as
he
came
slowly
toward
the
dean
cowboy
no
said
patches
no
i
ai
asserted
the
tailholt
mountain
man
stoutly
that
there
calf
is
a
calf
all
right
i
see
it
is
returned
the
rider
calmly
but
i
just
wait
until
nick
gets
back
and
ask
him
what
it
was
before
he
worked
over
the
iron
joe
excited
and
confused
by
the
cool
nerve
of
this
man
fell
readily
into
the
verbal
trap
you
better
go
now
an
not
wait
to
ask
nick
no
fool
questions
like
that
if
he
finds
you
here
talkin
with
me
when
he
gets
back
hell
be
fer
sure
me
an
you
are
friends
patches
an
that
why
you
you
better
pull
your
freight
while
the
goin
good
much
obliged
joe
but
there
no
hurry
you
do
need
to
be
so
rushed
it
will
be
an
hour
before
nick
gets
back
if
he
drives
that
cow
as
far
as
he
ought
again
poor
yavapai
joe
told
more
than
he
intended
you
do
need
to
worry
none
nick
he
sure
drive
her
far
enough
he
ai
no
chances
nick
ai
with
his
convictions
so
readily
confirmed
patches
had
good
ground
upon
which
to
base
his
following
remarks
he
had
made
a
long
shot
when
he
spoke
so
confidently
of
the
brand
on
the
calf
being
worked
over
for
of
course
the
calf
might
not
have
been
branded
at
all
when
the
tailholt
mountain
men
caught
it
but
joe
manner
as
well
as
his
warning
answer
told
that
the
shot
had
gone
home
the
fact
that
the
brand
had
been
worked
over
established
also
the
fact
that
it
was
the
brand
that
had
been
changed
because
the
was
the
only
brand
in
that
part
of
the
country
that
could
be
changed
into
the
patches
dropping
his
easy
manner
and
speaking
straight
to
the
point
said
look
here
joe
you
and
i
might
as
well
get
down
to
cases
you
know
i
am
your
friend
and
i
do
want
to
see
you
in
trouble
but
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
you
are
in
mighty
serious
trouble
right
now
i
was
hiding
right
there
in
those
bushes
close
enough
to
see
all
that
happened
and
i
know
that
this
is
a
calf
and
that
nick
and
you
worked
the
brand
over
you
know
that
it
means
the
penitentiary
for
you
as
well
as
for
nick
if
the
boys
do
string
you
both
up
without
any
ceremony
patches
paused
to
let
his
words
sink
in
joe
face
was
ashy
white
and
he
was
shaking
with
fright
as
he
stole
a
sneaking
look
toward
his
horse
patches
added
sharply
you
ca
give
me
the
slip
either
i
can
kill
you
before
you
get
half
way
to
your
horse
trapped
and
helpless
joe
looked
pleadingly
at
his
captor
you
send
me
up
would
you
now
patches
he
whined
you
an
me
good
friends
ai
we
anyway
he
would
let
me
go
to
the
pen
an
the
boys
would
dast
do
nothin
to
me
when
they
knew
whom
are
you
talking
about
demanded
patches
nick
do
be
a
fool
joe
nick
will
be
there
right

reply
without
an
instant
hesitation
you

as
well
as

much
chance

have
trying
to

one
way

me

the
and

baldwin

how

the
frightened
weakling
sullenly

at

and
be
a
man
come
on
let
be
moving
i
turn
this
calf
loose
first
though
he
was
bending
over
the
calf
when
a
noise
in
the
brush
caused
him
to
stand
suddenly
erect
joe
was
whimpering
with
terror
patches
said
fiercely
but
in
a
low
tone
shut
up
and
follow
my
lead
be
a
man
and
i
get
you
out
of
this
yet
nick
will
kill
us
sure
whined
joe
not
if
i
get
my
hands
on
him
first
he
wo
retorted
patches
but
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
the
cowboy
saw
phil
acton
ride
toward
them
from
the
shelter
of
the
timber
before
patches
could
speak
phil
gun
covered
him
and
the
voice
rang
out
sharply
hands
up
joe
hands
shot
above
his
head
patches
hesitated
quick
said
phil
and
as
patches
saw
the
man
eyes
over
the
black
barrel
of
the
weapon
he
obeyed
but
as
he
raised
his
hands
a
dull
flush
of
anger
colored
his
tanned
face
a
deeper
red
and
his
eyes
grew
dark
with
passion
he
realized
his
situation
instantly
the
mystery
that
surrounded
his
first
appearance
when
he
had
sought
employment
at
the
the
persistent
suspicion
of
many
of
the
cowboys
because
of
his
friendship
for
yavapai
joe
his
meeting
with
joe
which
the
professor
had
reported
his
refusal
to
explain
to
phil
his
return
to
the
ranch
when
everyone
was
away
and
he
himself
was
supposed
to
be
in
prescott
all
these
and
many
other
incidents
had
come
to
their
legitimate
climax
in
his
presence
on
that
spot
with
yavapai
joe
the
smouldering
fire
and
the
freshly
branded
calf
he
was
unarmed
but
phil
could
not
be
sure
of
that
for
many
a
cowboy
carries
his
gun
inside
the
leg
of
his
leather
chaps
where
it
does
not
so
easily
catch
in
the
brush
but
while
patches
saw
it
all
so
clearly
he
was
enraged
that
this
man
with
whom
he
had
lived
so
intimately
should
believe
him
capable
of
such
a
crime
and
treat
him
without
question
as
a
common
cattle
thief
coldness
toward
him
which
had
grown
so
gradually
during
the
past
three
months
in
this
peremptory
humiliation
reached
a
point
beyond
which
patches
patient
and
considerate
endurance
could
not
go
the
man
sense
of
justice
was
outraged
his
fine
feeling
of
honor
was
insulted
trapped
and
helpless
as
he
was
under
that
menacing
gun
he
was
possessed
by
a
determination
to
defend
himself
against
the
accusation
and
to
teach
phil
acton
that
there
was
a
limit
to
the
insult
he
would
endure
even
in
the
name
of
friendship
to
this
end
his
only
hope
was
to
trap
his
foreman
with
words
as
he
had
caught
yavapai
joe
at
a
game
of
words
honorable
patches
was
no
unskilled
novice
controlling
his
anger
he
said
coolly
with
biting
sarcasm
while
he
looked
at
the
cowboy
with
a
mocking
sneer
you
do
propose
to
take
any
chances
do
you
holding
up
an
unarmed
man
patches
saw
by
the
flush
that
swept
over
phil
cheeks
how
his
words
bit
it
does
pay
to
take
chances
with
your
kind
retorted
the
foreman
hotly
no
mocked
patches
but
it
will
pay
big
i
suppose
for
the
great
horse
phil
to
be
branded
as
a
sneak
and
a
coward
who
is
afraid
to
face
an
unarmed
man
unless
he
can
get
the
drop
on
him
phil
was
goaded
to
madness
by
the
cool
mocking
words
with
a
reckless
laugh
he
slipped
his
weapon
into
the
holster
and
sprang
to
the
ground
at
the
same
moment
patches
and
joe
lowered
their
hands
and
joe
unnoticed
by
either
of
the
angry
men
took
a
few
stealthy
steps
toward
his
horse
phil
deliberately
folding
his
arms
stood
looking
at
patches
i
just
call
that
bluff
you
sneakin
calf
stealer
he
said
coolly
now
unlimber
that
gun
of
yours
and
get
busy
angry
as
he
was
patches
felt
a
thrill
of
admiration
for
the
man
and
beneath
his
determination
to
force
phil
acton
to
treat
him
with
respect
he
was
proud
of
his
friend
who
had
answered
his
sneering
insinuation
with
such
fearlessness
but
he
could
not
now
hesitate
in
his
plan
of
provoking
phil
into
disarming
himself
you
something
of
a
yourself
are
you
he
mocked
you
know
i
have
no
gun
your
brave
pose
is
very
effective
i
would
congratulate
you
only
you
see
it
does
impress
me
in
the
least
with
an
oath
phil
snatched
his
gun
from
the
holster
and
threw
it
aside
have
it
any
way
you
like
he
retorted
and
started
toward
patches
then
a
curious
thing
happened
to
honorable
patches
angry
as
he
was
he
became
suddenly
dominated
by
something
that
was
more
potent
than
his
rage
stop
he
cried
sharply
and
with
such
ringing
force
that
phil
involuntarily
obeyed
i
ca
fight
you
this
way
phil
he
said
and
the
other
wondering
saw
that
whimsical
smile
on
his
lips
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
are
no
match
for
me
barehanded
you
could
even
touch
me
you
have
seen
curly
and
the
others
try
it
often
enough
you
are
as
helpless
in
my
power
now
as
i
was
in
yours
a
moment
ago
i
am
armed
now
and
you
are
not
i
ca
fight
you
this
way
phil
in
spite
of
himself
phil
acton
was
impressed
by
the
truth
and
fairness
of
patches
words
he
recognized
that
an
unequal
contest
could
satisfy
neither
of
them
and
that
it
made
no
difference
which
of
the
contestants
had
the
advantage
well
he
said
sarcastically
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
first
returned
patches
calmly
i
am
going
to
tell
you
how
i
happened
to
be
here
with
yavapai
joe
i
do
need
any
explanations
from
you
it
some
more
of
your
personal
business
i
suppose
retorted
phil
patches
controlled
himself
you
are
going
to
hear
the
explanation
just
the
same
he
returned
you
can
believe
it
or
not
just
as
you
please
and
what
then
demanded
phil
then
i
going
to
get
a
gun
and
we
settle
the
rest
of
it
man
to
man
on
equal
terms
just
as
soon
as
you
like
answered
patches
deliberately
phil
replied
shortly
go
ahead
with
your
palaver
i
have
to
hand
it
to
you
when
it
comes
to
talk
i
am
not
educated
that
way
myself
for
a
moment
patches
hesitated
as
though
on
the
point
of
changing
his
mind
about
the
explanation
then
his
sense
of
justice
justice
both
for
phil
and
himself
conquered
but
in
telling
phil
how
he
had
come
upon
the
scene
too
late
for
positive
proof
that
the
freshly
branded
calf
was
the
dean
property
and
in
explaining
how
when
the
foreman
arrived
he
had
just
persuaded
joe
to
go
with
him
and
give
the
necessary
evidence
against
nick
patches
forgot
the
possible
effect
of
his
words
upon
joe
himself
the
two
men
were
so
absorbed
in
their
own
affair
that
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
tailholt
mountain
outcast
and
joe
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
had
by
this
time
gained
a
position
beside
his
horse
as
he
heard
patches
tell
how
he
had
no
actual
evidence
that
the
calf
was
not
nick
cambert
property
a
look
of
anger
and
cunning
darkened
the
face
of
nick
follower
he
was
angry
at
the
way
patches
had
tricked
him
into
betraying
both
himself
and
his
evil
master
and
he
saw
a
way
to
defeat
the
two
cowboys
and
at
the
same
time
win
approval
quickly
the
fellow
mounted
his
horse
and
before
they
could
stop
him
was
out
of
sight
in
the
timber
i
done
it
now
exclaimed
patches
in
dismay
i
forgot
all
about
joe
i
do
think
he
counts
for
much
in
this
game
anyway
returned
phil
gruffly
as
he
spoke
the
foreman
turned
his
back
to
patches
and
walked
toward
his
gun
he
had
reached
the
spot
where
the
weapon
lay
on
the
ground
when
from
the
bushes
to
the
right
and
a
little
back
of
patches
who
stood
watching
his
companion
a
shot
rang
out
with
startling
suddenness
patches
saw
phil
stumble
forward
straighten
for
an
instant
as
though
by
sheer
power
of
his
will
and
turning
look
back
at
him
then
as
phil
fell
the
unarmed
cowboy
leaped
forward
toward
that
gun
on
the
ground
even
as
he
moved
a
second
shot
rang
out
and
he
felt
the
wind
of
the
bullet
on
his
cheek
with
phil
gun
in
his
hand
he
ran
toward
a
cedar
tree
on
the
side
of
the
open
space
opposite
the
point
from
which
the
shots
came
and
as
he
ran
another
bullet
whistled
past
a
man
moving
as
patches
moved
is
not
an
easy
mark
the
same
man
armed
and
protected
by
the
trunk
of
a
tree
is
still
more
difficult
a
moment
after
he
had
gained
cover
the
cowboy
heard
the
clatter
of
a
feet
near
the
spot
from
which
the
shots
had
come
and
by
the
sound
knew
that
the
unseen
marksman
had
chosen
to
retire
with
only
half
his
evident
purpose
accomplished
rather
than
take
the
risk
that
had
arisen
with
patches
success
in
turning
the
ambush
into
an
open
fight
as
the
sound
of
the
horse
swift
rush
down
the
side
of
the
ridge
grew
fainter
and
fainter
patches
ran
to
phil
a
quick
examination
told
him
that
the
bullet
had
entered
just
under
the
right
shoulder
and
that
the
man
though
unconscious
and
no
doubt
seriously
wounded
was
living
with
rude
bandages
made
by
tearing
his
shirt
into
strips
patches
checked
the
flow
of
blood
and
bound
up
the
wound
as
best
he
could
then
for
a
moment
he
considered
it
was
between
three
and
four
miles
to
the
ranch
he
could
ride
there
and
back
in
a
few
minutes
someone
must
start
for
a
doctor
without
an
instant
loss
of
time
with
water
proper
bandages
and
stimulants
the
wounded
man
could
be
cared
for
and
moved
in
the
buckboard
with
much
greater
safety
than
he
could
be
carried
in
his
present
condition
on
a
horse
the
risk
of
leaving
him
for
a
few
minutes
was
small
compared
to
the
risk
of
taking
him
to
the
house
under
the
only
conditions
possible
the
next
instant
patches
was
in
phil
saddle
and
riding
as
he
had
never
ridden
before
jim
reid
with
kitty
and
helen
was
on
the
way
back
from
prescott
as
kitty
had
planned
they
were
within
ten
miles
of
the
ranch
when
the
cattleman
who
sat
at
the
wheel
of
the
automobile
saw
a
horseman
coming
toward
them
a
moment
he
watched
the
approaching
figure
then
over
his
shoulder
he
said
to
the
girls
look
at
that
fellow
ride
something
doin
sure
as
he
spoke
he
turned
the
machine
well
out
of
the
road
a
moment
later
he
added
it
curly
elson
from
the
somethin
happened
in
the
valley
as
he
spoke
he
stopped
the
machine
and
sprang
out
so
that
the
cowboy
could
see
and
recognize
him
curly
did
not
draw
rein
until
he
was
within
a
few
feet
of
reid
then
he
brought
his
running
horse
up
with
a
suddenness
that
threw
the
animal
on
its
haunches
curly
spoke
tersely
phil
acton
is
shot
we
need
a
doctor
quick
without
a
word
jim
reid
leaped
into
the
automobile
the
car
backed
to
turn
around
as
it
paused
an
instant
before
starting
forward
again
kitty
put
her
hand
on
her
father
shoulder
wait
she
cried
i
going
to
phil
curly
i
want
your
horse
you
can
go
with
father
the
cowboy
was
on
the
ground
before
she
had
finished
speaking
and
before
the
automobile
was
under
way
kitty
was
riding
back
the
way
curly
had
come
kitty
was
scarcely
conscious
of
what
she
had
said
the
cowboy
first
words
had
struck
her
with
the
force
of
a
physical
blow
and
in
that
first
moment
she
had
been
weak
and
helpless
she
had
felt
as
though
a
heavy
weight
pressed
her
down
a
gray
mist
was
before
her
eyes
and
she
could
not
see
clearly
phil
acton
is
shot
phil
acton
is
shot
the
cowboy
words
had
repeated
themselves
over
and
over
then
with
a
sudden
rush
her
strength
came
again
the
mist
cleared
she
must
go
to
phil
she
must
go
fast
fast
oh
why
was
this
horse
so
slow
if
only
she
were
riding
her
own
midnight
she
did
not
think
as
she
rode
she
did
not
wonder
nor
question
nor
analyze
her
emotions
she
only
felt
it
was
phil
who
was
hurt
phil
the
boy
with
whom
she
had
played
when
she
was
a
little
girl
the
lad
with
whom
she
had
gone
to
school
the
young
man
who
had
won
the
first
love
of
her
young
woman
heart
it
was
phil
her
phil
who
was
hurt
and
she
must
go
to
him
she
must
go
fast
fast
it
seemed
to
kitty
that
hours
passed
before
she
reached
the
meadow
lane
she
was
glad
that
curly
had
left
the
gates
open
as
she
crossed
the
familiar
ground
between
the
old
acton
home
and
the
ranch
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
sandy
wash
she
saw
them
they
were
carrying
him
into
the
house
as
she
rode
into
the
yard
and
at
sight
of
that
still
form
the
gray
mist
came
again
and
she
caught
the
saddle
horn
to
save
herself
from
falling
but
it
was
only
a
moment
until
she
was
strong
again
and
ready
to
do
all
that
baldwin
asked
phil
had
regained
consciousness
before
they
started
home
with
him
but
he
was
very
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
and
the
journey
in
the
buckboard
though
bob
drove
ever
so
carefully
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
but
with
the
relief
that
came
when
he
was
at
last
lying
quietly
in
his
own
bed
and
with
the
help
of
the
stimulant
the
splendid
physical
strength
and
vitality
that
was
his
because
of
his
natural
and
unspoiled
life
again
brought
him
back
from
the
shadows
into
the
light
of
full
consciousness
it
was
then
that
the
dean
while
baldwin
and
kitty
were
occupied
for
a
few
moments
in
another
part
of
the
house
listened
to
all
that
his
foreman
could
tell
him
about
the
affair
up
to
the
time
that
he
had
fallen
unconscious
the
dean
asked
but
few
questions
but
when
the
details
were
all
clearly
fixed
in
his
mind
the
older
man
bent
over
phil
and
looked
straight
into
the
lad
clear
and
steady
eyes
while
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
phil
did
patches
do
this
and
the
young
man
answered
uncle
will
i
do
know
with
this
he
closed
his
eyes
wearily
as
though
to
sleep
and
the
dean
seeing
kitty
in
the
doorway
beckoned
her
to
come
and
sit
beside
the
bed
then
he
stole
quietly
from
the
room
as
in
a
dream
phil
had
seen
kitty
when
she
rode
into
the
yard
and
he
had
been
conscious
of
her
presence
as
she
moved
about
the
house
and
the
room
where
he
lay
but
he
had
given
no
sign
that
he
knew
she
was
there
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
dean
bidding
the
cowboy
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
looked
up
into
her
face
then
again
the
weary
lids
closed
and
he
gave
no
hint
that
he
recognized
her
save
that
the
white
lips
set
in
firmer
lines
as
though
at
another
stab
of
pain
as
she
watched
alone
beside
this
man
who
had
since
she
could
remember
been
a
part
of
her
life
and
as
she
realized
that
he
was
on
the
very
border
line
of
that
land
from
which
if
he
entered
he
could
never
return
to
her
kitty
reid
knew
the
truth
that
is
greater
than
any
knowledge
that
the
schools
of
man
can
give
she
knew
the
one
great
truth
of
her
womanhood
knew
it
not
from
text
book
or
class
room
not
from
learned
professor
or
cultured
associates
but
knew
it
from
that
good
master
of
life
who
with
infinite
wisdom
teaches
his
many
pupils
who
are
free
to
learn
in
the
school
of
schools
the
school
of
nature
in
that
hour
when
the
near
presence
of
death
so
overshadowed
all
the
trivial
and
things
of
life
when
the
little
standards
and
petty
values
of
poor
human
endeavor
were
as
nothing
this
woman
knew
that
by
the
unwritten
edict
of
god
who
decreed
that
in
all
life
two
should
be
as
one
this
man
was
her
only
lawful
mate
environment
circumstance
that
which
we
call
culture
and
education
even
death
might
separate
them
but
nothing
could
nullify
the
fact
that
was
attested
by
the
instinct
of
her
womanhood
bending
over
the
man
who
lay
so
still
she
whispered
the
imperative
will
of
her
heart
come
back
to
me
phil
i
want
you
i
need
you
dear
come
back
to
me
slowly
he
came
out
of
the
mists
of
weakness
and
pain
to
look
up
at
her
doubtfully
wonderingly
but
there
was
a
light
in
kitty
face
that
dispelled
the
doubt
and
changed
the
look
of
wondering
uncertainty
to
glad
conviction
he
did
not
speak
no
word
was
necessary
nor
did
he
move
for
he
must
be
very
still
and
hold
fast
with
all
his
strength
to
the
life
that
was
now
so
good
but
the
woman
knew
without
words
all
that
he
would
have
said
and
as
his
eyes
closed
again
she
bowed
her
head
in
thankfulness
then
rising
she
stole
softly
to
the
window
she
felt
that
she
must
look
out
for
a
moment
into
the
world
that
was
so
suddenly
new
and
beautiful
under
the
walnut
trees
she
saw
the
dean
talking
with
the
man
whom
she
had
promised
to
marry
later
reid
with
helen
and
curly
brought
the
doctor
and
the
noise
of
the
automobile
summoned
every
soul
on
the
place
to
wait
for
the
physician
verdict
of
life
or
death
while
the
dean
was
in
phil
room
with
the
physician
and
the
anxious
ones
were
gathered
in
a
little
group
in
front
of
the
house
jim
reid
stood
apart
from
the
others
talking
in
low
tones
with
the
cowboy
bob
patches
who
was
standing
behind
the
automobile
heard
bob
who
had
raised
his
voice
a
little
say
distinctly
i
tell
you
sir
there
a
bit
of
doubt
in
the
world
about
it
there
was
the
calf
a
layin
right
there
and
marked
he
plumb
forgot
to
turn
it
loose
i
reckon
bein
naturally
rattled
or
else
he
figgered
that
it
war
no
use
if
phil
should
be
able
to
tell
what
happened
the
way
i
make
it
out
is
that
phil
jumped
him
right
in
the
act
so
sudden
that
he
shot
without
thinkin
you
know
how
he
acts
quick
an
then
he
seen
what
he
had
done
an
that
it
was
more
than
an
even
break
that
phil
live
an
so
figgered
that
his
chance
was
better
to
stay
an
run
a
bluff
by
comin
for
help
an
all
that
if
he
tried
to
make
his
there
would
been
no
question
about
it
an
he
got
just
nerve
enough
to
take
the
chance
he
by
stayin
right
with
the
game
patches
started
as
though
to
go
toward
the
men
but
at
that
moment
the
doctor
came
from
the
house
as
the
physician
approached
the
waiting
group
that
odd
mirthless
smile
touched
patches
lips
then
he
stepped
forward
to
listen
with
the
others
to
the
doctor
words
phil
had
a
chance
the
doctor
said
but
he
told
them
frankly
that
it
was
only
a
chance
the
injured
man
wonderful
vitality
his
clean
blood
and
unimpaired
physical
strength
together
with
his
unshaken
nerve
and
an
indomitable
will
were
all
greatly
in
his
favor
with
careful
nursing
they
might
with
reason
hope
for
his
recovery
with
expressions
of
relief
the
group
separated
patches
walked
away
alone
reid
who
would
return
to
prescott
with
the
doctor
said
to
his
daughter
when
the
physician
was
ready
come

run

of
a
hurry
i
know
you
ought
to
stay
tell
stella
that
mother
will
be
over
for
a
little
while
this
evening
and
the
automobile
moved
away
that
night
while
baldwin
and
kitty
watched
by
phil
bedside
and
patches
in
his
room
waited
sleepless
alone
with
his
thoughts
men
from
the
ranch
on
the
other
side
of
the
quiet
meadow
were
riding
swiftly
through
the
darkness
before
the
new
day
had
driven
the
stars
from
the
wide
sky
a
little
company
of
silent
horsemen
gathered
in
the
corral
in
the
dim
gray
light
of
the
early
morning
they
followed
jim
reid
out
of
the
corral
and
riding
fast
crossed
the
valley
above
the
meadows
and
approached
the
corrals
from
the
west
one
man
in
the
company
led
a
horse
with
an
empty
saddle
just
beyond
the
little
rise
of
ground
outside
the
big
gate
they
halted
while
jim
reid
with
two
others
leaving
their
horses
with
the
silent
riders
behind
the
hill
went
on
into
the
corral
where
they
seated
themselves
on
the
edge
of
the
long
watering
trough
near
the
tank
which
hid
them
from
the
house
fifteen
minutes
later
when
the
dean
stepped
from
the
kitchen
porch
he
saw
curly
running
toward
the
house
as
the
older
man
hurried
toward
him
the
cowboy
pale
with
excitement
and
anger
cried
they
got
him
sir
grabbed
him
when
he
went
out
to
the
corral
the
dean
understood
instantly
my
horse
quick
curly
he
said
and
hurried
on
toward
the
saddle
shed
which
way
did
they
go
he
asked
as
he
mounted
toward
the
cedars
on
the
ridge
where
it
happened
came
the
answer
do
you
want
me
no
do
let
them
know
in
the
house
came
the
reply
and
the
dean
was
gone
the
little
company
of
horsemen
with
patches
in
their
midst
had
reached
the
scene
of
the
shooting
and
had
made
their
simple
preparations
from
that
moment
when
they
had
covered
him
with
their
guns
as
he
stepped
through
the
corral
gate
he
had
not
spoken
well
sir
said
the
spokesman
have
you
anything
to
say
before
we
proceed
patches
shook
his
head
and
wonderingly
they
saw
that
curious
mocking
smile
on
his
lips
i
do
suppose
that
any
remarks
i
might
make
would
impress
you
gentlemen
in
the
least
he
said
coolly
it
would
be
useless
and
unkind
for
me
to
detain
you
longer
than
is
necessary
an
involuntary
murmur
of
admiration
came
from
the
circle
they
were
men
who
could
appreciate
such
unflinching
courage
in
the
short
pause
that
followed
the
dean
riding
as
he
had
not
ridden
for
years
was
in
their
midst
before
they
could
check
him
the
veteran
cowman
was
beside
patches
with
a
quick
motion
he
snatched
the
riata
from
the
cowboy
neck
an
instant
more
and
he
had
cut
the
rope
that
bound
patches
hands
thank
you
sir
said
patches
calmly
do
do
that
will
called
jim
reid
peremptorily
this
is
our
business
in
the
same
breath
he
shouted
to
his
companions
take
him
again
boys
and
started
forward
stand
where
you
are
roared
the
dean
and
as
they
looked
upon
the
stern
countenance
of
the
man
who
was
so
respected
and
loved
throughout
all
that
country
not
a
man
moved
reid
himself
involuntarily
halted
at
the
command
i
do
this
and
more
jim
reid
said
the
dean
firmly
and
there
was
that
in
his
voice
which
in
the
wild
days
of
the
past
had
compelled
many
a
man
to
fear
and
obey
him
it
my
business
enough
that
you
can
call
this
meetin
off
right
here
i
be
responsible
for
this
man
you
boys
mean
well
but
you
a
little
mite
too
previous
this

aim
to
put
a
stop
to
that
thievin
tailholt
mountain
outfit
will
returned
reid
an
we
goin
to
do
it
right
now
a
murmur
of
agreement
came
from
the
group
the
dean
did
not
give
an
inch
you
put
a
stop
to
nothin
this
way
an
you
sure
start
somethin
that
be
more
than
stealin
a
few
calves
the
time
for
stringin
men
up
promiscuous
like
on
mere
suspicion
is
past
in
arizona
i
reckon
there
more
stock
branded
with
the
tailholt
mountain
iron
than
all
the
rest
of
you

lost
which
sure
entitles
me
to
a
front
seat
when
it
comes
to
the
he

one
of
the
older
men

retorted
the
dean
the
men

at
each
other
what
are
you
goin
to
do
then
asked
the
spokesman
i
goin
to
make
you
turn
him
loose
came
the
startling
answer
you
fellows
took
him
you
got
to
let
him
go
in
spite
of
the
grave
situation
several
of
the
men
grinned
at
the
answer
it
was
so
like
him
i
bet
a
steer
he
does
it
too
whispered
one
the
dean
turned
to
the
man
by
his
side
patches
tell
these
men
all
that
you
told
me
about
this
business
when
the
cowboy
had
told
his
story
in
detail
up
to
the
point
where
phil
came
upon
the
scene
the
dean
interrupted
him
now
get
down
there
show
us
exactly
how
it
happened
after
phil
rode
on
to
you
an
yavapai
joe
patches
obeyed
as
he
was
showing
them
where
phil
stood
when
the
shot
was
fired
the
dean
again
interrupted
with
wait
a
minute
tom
you
get
down
there
an
stand
just
as
phil
was
standin
the
cattleman
obeyed
when
he
had
taken
the
position
the
dean
continued
now
patches
stand
like
you
was
when
phil
was
hit
patches
obeyed
now
then
where
did
that
shot
come
from
asked
the
dean
patches
pointed
the
dean
did
not
need
to
direct
the
next
step
in
his
demonstration
three
of
the
men
were
already
off
their
horses
and
moving
around
the
bushes
indicated
by
patches
here
the
tracks
all
right
called
one
an
here
added
another
from
a
few
feet
further
away
was
where
he
left
his
horse
an
now
continued
the
dean
when
the
three
men
had
come
back
from
behind
the
bushes
and
with
patches
had
remounted
their
horses
tell
you
somethin
else
i
had
a
talk
with
phil
himself
an
the
story
agrees
with
what
patches
has
just
told
you
in
every
point
an
furthermore
phil
told
me
straight
when
i
asked
him
that
he
did
know
himself
who
fired
that
shot
he
paused
for
a
moment
for
them
to
grasp
the
full
import
of
his
words
then
he
summed
up
the
case
as
the
thing
stands
we
got
no
evidence
against
anybody
it
ca
be
proved
that
the
calf
was
nick
property
in
the
first
place
it
be
proved
that
nick
was
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
it
ca
be
proved
who
fired
that
shot
it
could
have
been
yavapai
joe
or
anybody
else
just
as
well
as
nick
phil
himself
by
bein
too
quick
to
jump
at
conclusions
blocked
this
man
game
just
when
he
was
playin
the
only
hand
that
could
have
won
out
against
nick
if
phil
had
happened
on
to
patches
and
joe
when
he
did
or
if
he
had
been
a
little
slower
about
findin
a
man
guilty
just
because
appearances
were
against
him
we
had
the
evidence
from
yavapai
joe
that
we
been
wantin
could
called
the
turn
on
that
tailholt
outfit
proper
as
it
stands
now
we
right
where
we
was
before
now
what
are
you
all
goin
to
do
about
it
the
men
grinned
shamefacedly
but
were
glad
that
the
tragedy
had
been
averted
they
were
by
no
means
convinced
that
patches
was
not
guilty
but
they
were
quick
to
see
the
possibilities
of
a
mistake
in
the
situation
i
reckon
the
dean
has
adjourned
the
meetin
boys
said
one
come
on
called
another
let
be
ridin
when
the
last
man
had
disappeared
in
the
timber
the
dean
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
flushed
face
and
looked
at
patches
thoughtfully
then
that
twinkle
of
approval
came
into
the
blue
eyes
that
a
few
moments
before
had
been
so
cold
and
uncompromising
come
son
he
said
gently
let
go
to
breakfast
stella
be
wonderin
what
keepin
us
chapter

across
the

to
help

the
work
of
the
household

her
but
when
she
saw
that
she
was
really
needed
and
that
baldwin
would
be
glad
of
her
help
she
told
jimmy
that
she
would
stay
for

day
someone
from
the
the
dean
said
would
take
her
home
when
she
was
ready
to
go
the
afternoon

nearly
gone
when
curly
returned
from
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
with
a
woman
who
would
relieve
baldwin
of
the
housework
and
as
her
presence
was
no
longer
needed
helen
told
the
dean
that
she
would

reid
home

just
tell
patches
to
take
you
over
in
the
buckboard
said
the
dean
it
was
mighty
kind
of
you
to
give
us
a
hand
it
been
a
big
help
to
stella
and
kitty
please
do
bother
about
the
buckboard
baldwin
i
would
enjoy
the
walk
so
much
but
i
would
be
glad
if
patches
could
go
with
me
i
would
really
feel
safer
you
know
she
smiled
baldwin
was
sleeping
and
kitty
was
watching
beside
phil
so
the
dean
himself
went
as
far
as
the
wash
with
helen
and
patches
as
the
two
set
out
for
their
walk
across
the
meadows
when
helen
had
said
to
the
dean
with
a
promise
to
come
again
on
the
morrow
and
he
had
turned
back
toward
the
house
she
said
to
her
companion
oh
larry
i
am
so
glad
for
this
opportunity
i
wanted
to
see
you
alone
and
i
could
think
how
it
was
to
be
managed
i
have
something
to
tell
you
larry
something
that
i
tell
you
and
you
must
promise
to
be
very
patient
with
me
you
know
what
happened
this
morning
do
you
he
asked
gravely
for
he
thought
from
her
words
that
she
had
perhaps
chanced
to
hear
of
some
further
action
to
be
taken
by
the
suspicious
cattlemen
it
was
terrible
terrible
larry
why
did
you
tell
them
who
you
are
why
did
you
let
them
she
could
not
finish
he
laughed
shortly
it
would
have
been
such
a
sinful
waste
of
words
ca
you
imagine
me
trying
to
make
those
men
believe
such
a
fairy
story
under
such
circumstances
for
a
little
they
walked
in
silence
then
he
asked
is
it
about
jim
reid
suspicion
that
you
wanted
to
see
me
helen
no
larry
it
is
it
about
kitty
she
answered
oh
kitty
told
me
all
about
it
helen
continued
the
poor
child
is
almost
beside
herself
the
man
did
not
speak
helen
looked
up
at
him
almost
as
a
mother
might
have
done
do
you
love
her
so
very
much
larry
tell
me
truly
do
you
patches
could
not
dared
not
look
at
her
tell
me
larry
she
insisted
gently
i
must
know
do
you
love
kitty
as
a
man
ought
to
love
his
wife
the
man
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
low
and
shaking
with
emotion
why
should
you
ask
me
such
a
question
you
know
the
answer
what
right
have
you
to
force
me
to
tell
you
that
which
you
already
know
that
i
love
you
another
man
wife
helen
face
went
white
in
her
anxiety
for
kitty
she
had
not
foreseen
this
situation
in
which
by
her
question
she
had
placed
herself
larry
she
said
sharply
well
he
retorted
passionately
you
insisted
that
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
insisted
that
you
tell
me
the
truth
about
kitty
she
returned
well
you
have
it
he
answered
quickly
oh
larry
she
cried
how
could
you
how
could
you
ask
a
woman
you
do
not
love
to
be
your
wife
how
could
you
do
it
larry
and
just
when
i
was
so
proud
of
you
so
glad
for
you
that
you
had
found
yourself
that
you
were
such
a
splendid
man
kitty
and
i
are
the
best
of
friends
he
answered
in
a
dull
spiritless
tone
the
best
of
companions
in
the
past
year
i
have
grown
very
fond
of
her
we
have
much
in
common
i
can
give
her
the
life
she
desires
the
life
she
is
fitted
for
i
will
make
her
happy
i
will
be
true
to
her
i
will
be
to
her
everything
that
a
man
should
be
to
his
wife
no
larry
she
said
gently
touched
by
the
hopelessness
in
his
voice
for
he
had
spoken
as
though
he
already
knew
that
his
attempt
to
justify
his
engagement
to
kitty
was
vain
no
larry
you
can
not
be
to
kitty
everything
that
a
man
should
be
to
his
wife
you
can
not
without
love
be
a
husband
to
her
again
they
walked
in
silence
for
a
little
way
then
helen
asked
and
are
you
sure
larry
that
kitty
cares
for
you
as
a
woman
ought
to
care
i
mean
i
could
not
have
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
if
i
had
not
thought
so
he
answered
with
more
spirit
of
course
returned
his
companion
gently
and
kitty
could
not
have
answered
if
she
had
not
believed
that
you
loved
her
do
you
mean
that
you
think
kitty
does
not
care
for
me
helen
i
that
she
loves
phil
acton
larry
i
saw
it
in
her
face
when
we
first
learned
that
he
was
hurt
and
the
poor
girl
confessed
it
she
loved
him
all
the
time
larry
has
loved
him
ever
since
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
she
has
tried
to
deny
her
heart
she
has
tried
to
put
other
things
above
her
love
but
she
knows
now
that
she
can
not
it
is
fortunate
for
you
both
that
she
realized
her
love
for
acton
before
she
had
spoiled
not
only
her
own
life
but
yours
as
well
but
how
could
she
promise
to
be
my
wife
when
she
loved
phil
he
demanded
but
how
could
you
ask
her
when
you
helen
retorted
quickly
without
thinking
of
herself
then
she
continued
bravely
putting
herself
aside
in
her
effort
to
make
him
understand
you
tempted
her
larry
you
did
not
mean
it
so
perhaps
but
you
did
you
tempted
her
with
your
wealth
with
all
that
you
could
give
her
of
material
luxuries
and
ease
and
refinement
you
tempted
her
to
substitute
those
things
for
love
i
know
larry
i
know
because
you
see
dear
man
i
was
once
tempted
too
he
made
a
gesture
of
protest
but
she
went
on
you
did
not
know
but
i
can
tell
you
now
that
nothing
but
the
memory
of
my
dear
teaching
saved
me
from
a
terrible
mistake
you
are
a
man
now
larry
you
are
more
to
me
than
any
man
in
the
world
save
one
and
more
than
any
man
in
the
world
save
that
one
i
respect
and
admire
you
for
the
manhood
you
have
gained
but
oh
larry
larry
do
you
see
a
man
a
there
is
one
thing
above
all
others
that
he
can
not
do
he
can
not
take
advantage
of
a
woman
weakness
he
can
not
tempt
her
beyond
her
strength
he
must
be
strong
both
for
himself
and
her
he
must
save
her
always
from
herself
the
man
lifted
his
head
and
looked
away
toward
granite
mountain
as
once
before
this
woman
had
aroused
him
to
assert
his
manhood
strength
she
called
now
to
all
that
was
finest
and
truest
in
the
depth
of
his
being
you
are
always
right
helen
he
said
almost
reverently
no
larry
she
answered
quickly
but
you
know
that
i
am
right
in
this
i
will
free
kitty
from
her
promise
at
once
he
said
as
though
to
end
the
matter
helen
answered
quickly
but
that
is
exactly
what
you
must
not
do
the
man
was
bewildered
why
i
thought
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
she
laughed
happily
as
she
said
stupid
larry
do
you
understand
you
must
make
kitty
send
you
about
your
business
you
must
save
her
ca
you
see
how
ashamed
and
humiliated
she
would
be
if
she
imagined
for
a
moment
that
you
did
not
love
her
think
what
she
would
suffer
if
she
knew
that
you
had
merely
tried
to
buy
her
with
your
wealth
and
the
things
you
possess
she
disregarded
his
protest
that
exactly
what
your
proposal
meant
larry
a
girl
like
kitty
if
she
knew
the
truth
of
what
she
had
done
might
even
fancy
herself
unworthy
to
accept
her
happiness
now
that
it
has
come
you
must
make
her
dismiss
you
and
all
that
you
could
give
her
you
must
make
her
proud
and
happy
to
give
herself
to
the
man
she
loves
but
what
can
i
do
he
asked
in
desperation
i
do
know
larry
but
you
must
manage
somehow
for
kitty
sake
you
if
only
the
dean
had
not
interrupted
the
proceedings
this
morning
how
it
would
have
simplified
everything
he
mused
and
she
saw
that
as
always
he
was
laughing
at
himself
do
larry
please
do
she
cried
earnestly
he
looked
at
her
curiously
would
you
have
me
lie
to
her
helen
deliberately
lie
she
answered
quietly
i
do
think
that
i
would
raise
that
question
if
i
were
you
larry
considering
all
the
circumstances
on
his
way
back
to
the
patches
walked
as
a
man
who
having
determined
upon
a
difficult
and
distasteful
task
is
of
a
mind
to
undertake
it
without
delay
after
supper
that
evening
he
managed
to
speak
to
kitty
when
no
one
was
near
i
must
see
you
alone
for
a
few
minutes
he
whispered
hurriedly
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
be
under
the
trees
near
the
bank
of
the
come
to
me
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
and
you
can
slip
away
the
young
woman
wondered
at
his
manner
he
was
so
hurried
and
appeared
so
nervous
and
unlike
himself
but
patches
i
you
must
he
interrupted
with
a
quick
look
toward
the
dean
who
was
approaching
them
i
have
something
to
tell
you
something
that
i
must
tell
you
he
turned
to
speak
to
the
dean
and
kitty
presently
left
them
an
hour
later
when
the
night
had
come
she
found
him
waiting
as
he
had
said
listen
kitty
he
began
abruptly
and
she
thought
from
his
manner
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
nervous
fear
i
must
go
i
dare
not
stay
here
another
day
i
am
going
why
patches
she
said
forcing
herself
to
speak
quietly
in
order
to
calm
him
what
is
the
matter
matter
he
returned
hurriedly
you
know
what
they
tried
to
do
to
me
this
morning
kitty
was
shocked
it
was
true
that
she
did
not
could
not
care
for
this
man
as
she
loved
phil
but
she
had
thought
him
her
dearest
friend
and
she
respected
and
admired
him
it
was
not
good
to
find
him
now
like
this
shaken
and
afraid
she
could
not
understand
for
the
moment
her
own
trouble
was
put
aside
by
her
honest
concern
for
him
but
patches
she
said
earnestly
that
is
all
past
now
it
can
not
happen
again
you
do
not
know
he
returned
or
you
would
not
feel
so
sure
phil
might
he
checked
himself
as
if
he
feared
to
finish
the
sentence
kitty
thought
now
that
there
must
be
more
cause
for
his
manner
than
she
had
guessed
but
you
are
not
a
cattle
thief
she
protested
you
have
only
to
explain
who
you
are
no
one
would
for
a
moment
believe
that
lawrence
knight
could
be
guilty
of
stealing
it
ridiculous
on
the
face
of
it
you
do
not
understand
he
returned
desperately
there
is
more
in
this
than
stealing
kitty
started
you
do
mean
patches
you
ca
mean
phil
she
gasped
yes
i
mean
phil
he
whispered
i
we
were
quarreling
i
was
angry
my
god
girl
do
you
see
why
i
must
go
i
dare
not
stay
listen
kitty
it
will
be
all
right
once
i
am
out
of
this
country
and
living
under
my
own
name
i
will
be
safe
later
you
can
come
to
me
you
will
come
wo
you
dear
you
know
how
i
want
you
this
need
make
no
change
in
our
plans
if
you
love
me
you
she
stopped
him
with
a
low
cry
and
you
it
was
you
who
did
that
but
i
tell
you
we
were
quarreling
kitty
he
protested
weakly
and
you
think
that
i
could
go
to
you
now
she
was
trembling
with
indignation
oh
you
are
so
mistaken
it
seems
that
i
was
mistaken
too
i
never
dreamed
that
you
nothing
nothing
that
you
could
ever
do
would
make
me
forget
what
you
have
told
me
you
are
right
to
go
you
mean
that
you
will
not
come
to
me
he
faltered
could
you
really
think
that
i
would
she
retorted
but
kitty
you
will
let
me
go
you
will
not
betray
me
you
will
give
me
a
chance
it
is
the
only
thing
that
i
can
do
she
answered
coldly
i
should
die
of
shame
if
it
were
ever
known
that
i
had
thought
of
being
more
to
you
than
i
have
been
but
you
must
go
and
with
this
she
left
him
fairly
running
toward
the
house
alone
in
the
darkness
honorable
patches
smiled
mockingly
to
himself
when
morning
came
there
was
great
excitement
at
the
ranch
patches
was
missing
and
more
the
best
horse
in
the
outfit
the
big
bay
with
the
blazed
face
had
also
disappeared
quickly
the
news
spread
throughout
the
valley
and
to
the
distant
ranches
and
many
were
the
wise
heads
that
nodded
understandingly
and
many
were
the
i
told
you
so
the
man
who
had
appeared
among
them
so
mysteriously
and
who
for
a
year
had
been
a
topic
of
conversation
had
finally
established
his
character
beyond
all
question
but
the
cattlemen
felt
with
reason
because
of
the
dean
vigorous
defense
of
the
man
when
they
would
have
administered
justice
that
the
matter
was
now
in
his
hands
they
offered
their
services
and
much
advice
they
quietly
joked
about
the
price
of
horses
but
the
dean
laughed
at
their
jokes
listened
to
their
advice
and
said
that
he
thought
the
sheriff
of
yavapai
county
could
be
trusted
to
handle
the
case
to
helen
only
kitty
told
of
her
last
interview
with
patches
and
helen
shocked
and
surprised
at
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
man
had
brought
about
kitty
freedom
and
peace
of
mind
bade
the
girl
forget
and
be
happy
when
the
crisis
was
passed
and
phil
was
out
of
danger
kitty
returned
to
her
home
but
every
day
she
and
helen
drove
across
the
meadows
to
see
how
the
patient
was
progressing
then
one
day
helen
said
to
her
williamson
valley
friends
and
went
with
stanford
to
the
home
he
had
prepared
for
her
and
after
that
kitty
spent
still
more
of
her
time
at
the
house
across
the
wash
from
the
old
acton
homestead
it
was
during
those
weeks
of
phil
recovery
while
he
was
slowly
regaining
his
full
measure
of
health
and
strength
that
kitty
learned
to
know
the
cowboy
in
a
way
that
she
had
never
permitted
herself
to
know
him
before
little
by
little
as
they
sat
together
under
the
walnut
trees
or
walked
slowly
about
the
place
the
young
woman
came
to
understand
the
mind
of
the
man
as
phil
shyly
at
first
then
more
freely
opened
the
doors
of
his
inner
self
and
talked
to
her
as
he
had
talked
to
patches
of
the
books
he
had
read
of
his
observations
and
thoughts
of
nature
and
of
the
great
world
movements
and
activities
that
by
magazines
and
books
and
papers
were
brought
to
his
hand
she
learned
to
her
surprise
that
even
as
he
lived
amid
the
scenes
that
called
for
the
highest
type
of
physical
strength
and
courage
he
lived
an
intellectual
life
that
was
as
marked
for
its
strength
and
manly
vigor
but
while
they
came
thus
daily
into
more
intimate
and
closer
companionship
they
spoke
to
no
one
of
their
love
kitty
knowing
how
her
father
would
look
upon
her
engagement
to
the
cowboy
put
off
the
announcement
from
time
to
time
not
wishing
their
happy
companionship
to
be
marred
during
those
days
of
phil
recovery
when
he
was
strong
enough
to
ride
again
kitty
would
come
with
midnight
and
together
they
would
roam
about
the
ranch
and
the
country
near
by
so
it
happened
that
sunday
afternoon
and
reid
with
the
three
boys
were
making
a
neighborly
call
on
the
baldwins
and
phil
and
kitty
were
riding
in
the
vicinity
of
the
spot
where
kitty
had
first
met
patches
they
were
seated
in
the
shade
of
a
cedar
on
the
ridge
not
far
from
the
drift
fence
gate
when
phil
saw
three
horsemen
approaching
from
the
further
side
of
the
fence
by
the
time
the
horsemen
had
reached
the
gate
phil
knew
them
to
be
yavapai
joe
nick
cambert
and
honorable
patches
kitty
too
had
by
this
time
recognized
the
riders
and
with
an
exclamation
started
to
rise
to
her
feet
but
phil
said
quietly
wait
kitty
there
something
about
that
outfit
that
looks
mighty
queer
to
me
the
men
were
riding
in
single
file
with
yavapai
joe
in
the
lead
and
patches
last
and
their
positions
were
not
changed
when
they
halted
while
joe
without
dismounting
unlatched
the
gate
they
came
through
the
opening
still
in
the
same
order
and
as
they
halted
again
while
patches
closed
the
gate
phil
saw
what
it
was
that
caused
them
to
move
with
such
apparent
lack
of
freedom
in
their
relative
positions
and
why
nick
cambert
attitude
in
the
saddle
was
so
stiff
and
unnatural
hands
were
secured
behind
his
back
and
his
feet
were
tied
under
the
horse
from
stirrup
to
stirrup
while
his
horse
was
controlled
by
a
lead
rope
one
end
of
which
was
made
fast
to
yavapai
joe
saddle
horn
patches
caught
sight
of
the
two
under
the
tree
as
he
came
through
the
gate
but
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
noticed
them
as
the
little
procession
moved
slowly
nearer
phil
and
kitty
looked
at
each
other
without
a
word
but
as
they
turned
again
to
watch
the
approaching
horsemen
kitty
impulsively
grasped
phil
arm
and
sitting
so
in
such
unconscious
intimacy
they
must
have
made
a
pleasing
picture
at
least
the
man
who
rode
behind
nick
cambert
seemed
to
think
so
for
he
was
trying
to
smile
when
the
riders
were
almost
within
speaking
distance
of
the
pair
under
the
tree
they
stopped
and
the
watchers
saw
joe
turn
his
face
toward
patches
for
a
moment
then
look
in
their
direction
nick
cambert
did
not
raise
his
head
patches
came
on
toward
them
alone
as
they
saw
that
it
was
the
man
purpose
to
speak
to
them
phil
and
kitty
rose
and
stood
waiting
kitty
with
her
hand
still
on
her
companion
arm
and
now
as
they
were
given
a
closer
and
less
obstructed
view
of
the
man
who
had
been
their
friend
kitty
and
phil
again
exchanged
wondering
glances
this
was
not
the
honorable
patches
whom
they
had
known
so
intimately
the
man
clothing
was
soiled
with
dirt
and
old
from
rough
usage
with
here
and
there
a
ragged
tear
his
tall
form
drooped
with
weariness
and
his
unshaven
face
dark
and
deeply
tanned
and
grimed
with
sweat
and
dirt
was
thin
and
drawn
and
old
and
his
tired
eyes
deep
set
in
their
dark
hollows
were
bloodshot
as
though
from
sleepless
nights
his
dry
lips
parted
in
a
painful
smile
as
he
dismounted
stiffly
and
limped
courteously
forward
to
greet
them
i
know
that
i
am
scarcely
presentable
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
as
worn
and
old
as
his
face
but
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
say
perhaps
i
should
introduce
myself
though
he
added
as
if
to
save
them
from
embarrassment
my
name
is
lawrence
knight
i
am
a
deputy
sheriff
of
this
county
a
slight
movement
as
he
spoke
threw
back
his
unbuttoned
jumper
and
they
saw
the
badge
of
his
office
in
my
official
capacity
i
am
taking
a
prisoner
to
prescott
phil
recovered
first
and
caught
the
officer
hand
in
a
grip
that
told
more
than
words
kitty
nearly
betrayed
her
secret
when
she
gasped
but
you
you
said
that
you
with
his
ready
skill
he
saved
her
that
my
name
was
patches
i
know
it
was
wrong
to
deceive
you
as
i
did
and
i
regret
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
lie
so
deliberately
but
the
situation
seemed
to
demand
it
and
i
hoped
that
when
you
understood
you
would
forgive
the
part
i
was
forced
to
play
for
the
good
of
everyone
interested
kitty
understood
the
meaning
in
his
words
that
was
unknown
to
phil
and
her
eyes
expressed
the
gratitude
that
she
could
not
speak
by
the
way
patches
continued
i
am
not
mistaken
in
offering
my
congratulations
and
best
wishes
am
i
they
laughed
happily
we
have
made
no
announcement
yet
phil
answered
but
you
seem
to
know
everything
i
feel
like
saying
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
bless
you
my
children
you
make
me
feel
strangely
old
he
returned
with
a
touch
of
his
old
wistfulness
then
he
added
in
his
droll
way
perhaps
though
it
from
living
in
the
open
and
sleeping
in
my
clothes
so
long
talk
about
horses
i
give
my
kingdom
for
a
bath
a
shave
and
a
clean
shirt
i
had
begun
to
think
that
our
old
friend
nick
never
would
brand
another
calf
that
he
had
reformed
just
to
get
even
with
me
you
know
by
the
way
phil
you
will
be
interested
to
know
that
nick
is
the
man
who
is
really
responsible
for
your
happiness
how
demanded
phil
why
it
was
nick
who
fired
the
shot
that
brought
kitty
to
her
senses
my
partner
there
yavapai
joe
saw
him
do
it
if
you
people
would
like
to
thank
my
prisoner
i
will
permit
it
when
they
had
decided
that
they
would
deny
themselves
that
pleasure
patches
said
i
do
blame
you
he
a
surly
beast
anyway
which
reminds
me
that
i
must
be
about
my
official
business
and
land
him
in
prescott
i
am
going
to
stop
at
the
ranch
and
ask
the
dean
for
the
team
and
buckboard
though
he
added
as
he
climbed
painfully
into
the
saddle
adios
my
children
do
stay
out
too
late
hand
in
hand
they
watched
him
rejoin
his
companions
and
ride
away
behind
the
two
tailholt
mountain
men
the
dean
and
baldwin
with
their
friends
from
the
neighboring
ranch
were
enjoying
their
sunday
afternoon
together
as
old
friends
will
when
the
three
reid
boys
and
little
billy
came
running
from
the
corral
where
they
had
been
holding
an
amateur
bronco
riding
contest
with
a
calf
for
the
wild
and
wicked
outlaw
as
they
ran
toward
the
group
under
the
walnut
trees
the
lads
disturbed
the
peaceful
conversation
of
their
elders
with
wild
shouts
of
patches
has
come
back
patches
has
come
back
nick
cambert
is
with
him
so
yavapai
joe
jim
reid
sprang
to
his
feet
but
the
dean
calmly
kept
his
seat
and
glancing
up
at
his
big
friend
with
twinkling
eyes
said
to
the
boys
with
pretended
gruffness
aw
what
the
matter
with
you
kids
you
know
that
horse
thief
patches
would
dare
show
himself
in
williamson
valley
again
you
havin
bad
dreams
that
what
the
matter
with
you
or
else
you
tryin
to
scare
us
honest
it
patches
uncle

cried
littly
billy
we
seen
him
comin
from
over
beyond
the
corral
said
jimmy
i
saw
him
first
shouted
conny
i
was
up
in
the
grand
stand
i
mean
on
the
fence
me
too
chirped
jack
jim
reid
stood
looking
toward
the
corral
the
boys
are
right
will
he
said
in
a
low
tone
there
they
come
now
as
the
three
horsemen
rode
into
the
yard
and
the
watchers
noted
the
peculiarity
of
their
companionship
jim
reid
muttered
something
under
his
breath
but
the
dean
as
he
rose
leisurely
to
his
feet
was
smiling
broadly
the
little
procession
halted
when
the
horses
evidenced
their
dislike
of
the
automobile
and
patches
came
stiffly
forward
on
foot
lifting
his
battered
hat
courteously
to
the
company
he
said
to
the
dean
i
have
returned
your
horse
sir
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
think
you
will
find
him
in
fairly
good
condition
jim
reid
repeated
whatever
it
was
that
he
had
muttered
to
himself
the
dean
chuckled
jim
he
said
to
the
big
cattleman
i
want
to
introduce
my
friend
lawrence
knight
one
of
sheriff
deputies
it
looks
like
he
had
been
busy
over
in
the
tailholt
mountain
neighborhood
the
two
men
shook
hands
silently
reid
greeted
the
officer
cordially
while
baldwin
to
the
dean
great
delight
demonstrated
her
welcome
in
the
good
mother
way
will
baldwin
i
could
shake
you
she
cried
as
patches
stood
a
little
confused
by
her
impulsive
greeting
here
you
knew
all
the
time
and
you
kept
pesterin
me
by
trying
to
make
me
believe
that
you
thought
he
had
run
away
because
he
was
a
thief
it
was
perhaps
the
proudest
moment
of
the
dean
life
when
he
admitted
that
patches
had
confided
in
him
that
morning
when
they
were
so
late
to
breakfast
and
how
he
had
understood
that
the
man
disappearance
and
the
pretense
of
stealing
a
horse
had
been
only
a
blind
the
good
dean
never
dreamed
that
there
was
so
much
more
in
honorable
patches
strategy
than
he
knew
baldwin
said
patches
presently
could
you
let
me
have
the
team
and
buckboard
i
want
to
get
my
prisoners
to
prescott
and
he
laughed
shortly
well
i
certainly
would
appreciate
those
cushions
sure
son
you
can
have
the
whole
outfit
if
you
want
it
answered
the
dean
but
hold
on
a
minute
he
turned
with
twinkling
eyes
to
his
neighbor
here
jim
with
a
perfectly
good
automobile
that
do
seem
to
be
busy
the
big
man
responded
cordially
why
of
course
i
be
glad
to
take
you
in
thank
you
returned
patches
i
be
ready
in
a
minute
but
you
goin
to
have
something
to
eat
first
cried
baldwin
i
bet
you
half
starved
you
sure
look
it
patches
shook
his
head
do
tempt
me
mother
i
ca
stop
now
but
you
come
back
home
wo
you
she
asked
anxiously
i
would
like
to
he
said
and
may
i
bring
a
friend
your
friends
are
our
friends
son
she
answered
of
course
he
comin
back
said
the
dean
where
else
would
he
go
i
like
to
know
they
watched
him
as
he
went
to
his
prisoner
and
as
unlocking
the
handcuff
that
held
nick
right
wrist
he
it
on
his
own
left
arm
thus
linking
his
prisoner
securely
to
himself
then
he
spoke
to
joe
and
the
young
man
dismounting
unfastened
the
rope
that
bound
nick
feet
when
nick
was
on
the
ground
the
three
came
toward
the
machine
i
am
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
let
someone
take
care
of
the
horses
called
patches
to
the
dean
i
look
after
them
the
dean
returned
do
forget
now
that
comin
back
jim
will
bring
you
jim
reid
as
the
three
men
reached
the
automobile
said
to
patches
will
you
take
both
of
your
prisoners
in
the
back
seat
with
you
or
shall
i
take
one
of
them
in
front
with
me
patches
looked
the
big
man
straight
in
the
eyes
and
they
heard
him
answer
with
significant
emphasis
as
he
placed
his
free
hand
on
yavapai
joe
shoulder
i
have
only
one
prisoner
reid
this
man
is
my
friend
he
will
take
whatever
seat
he
prefers
yavapai
joe
climbed
into
the
rear
seat
with
the
officer
and
his
prisoner
it
was
after
dark
when
reid
returned
to
the
ranch
with
patches
and
joe
you
will
find
your
room
all
ready
son
said
baldwin
and
there
plenty
of
hot
water
in
the
bathroom
tank
for
you
both
joe
can
take
the
extra
bed
in
curly
room
you
show
him
i
have
your
supper
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
patches
almost
fell
asleep
at
the
table
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
he
went
to
his
bed
where
he
remained
as
phil
reported
at
intervals
during
the
next
forenoon
dead
to
the
world
until
dinner
time
in
the
afternoon
they
gathered
under
the
walnut
trees
the
household
and
the
friends
from
the
neighboring
ranch
and
patches
told
them
his
story
how
when
he
had
left
the
ranch
that
night
he
had
ridden
straight
to
his
old
friend
stanford
manning
and
how
stanford
had
gone
with
him
to
the
sheriff
where
through
manning
influence
together
with
the
letter
which
patches
had
brought
from
the
dean
he
had
been
made
an
officer
of
the
law
as
he
told
them
briefly
of
his
days
and
nights
alone
they
needed
no
minute
details
to
understand
what
it
had
meant
to
him
it
was
the
work
of
catching
nick
in
a
way
to
ensure
his
conviction
that
i
minded
he
said
but
the
trouble
was
that
while
i
was
watching
nick
day
and
night
and
dodging
him
all
the
time
i
was
afraid
some
enthusiastic
would
run
on
to
me
and
treat
himself
to
a
shot
just
for
luck
not
that
i
would
have
minded
that
so
much
either
after
the
first
week
he
added
in
his
droll
way
but
considering
all
the
circumstances
it
would
have
been
rather
a
poor
sort
of
finish
and
what
about
yavapai
joe
asked
phil
patches
smiled
where
is
joe
what
he
been
doing
all
day
the
dean
answered
he
just
been
moseyin
around
i
tried
to
get
him
to
talk
but
all
he
would
say
was
that
he
rather
let
knight
tell
it
billy
said
patches
will
you
find
yavapai
joe
and
tell
him
that
i
would
like
to
see
him
here
when
little
billy
with
the
assistance
of
jimmy
and
conny
and
jack
had
gone
proudly
on
his
mission
patches
said
to
the
others
technically
of
course
joe
is
my
prisoner
until
after
the
trial
but
please
let
him
feel
it
he
will
be
the
principal
witness
for
the
state
when
yavapai
joe
appeared
embarrassed
and
ashamed
in
their
presence
patches
said
as
courteously
as
he
would
have
introduced
an
equal
joe
i
want
my
friends
to
know
your
real
name
there
is
no
better
place
in
the
world
than
right
here
to
start
that
job
of
that
we
have
talked
about
you
remember
that
i
told
you
how
i
started
here
yavapai
joe
lifted
his
head
and
stood
straighter
by
his
tall
side
and
there
was
a
new
note
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
whatever
you
say
goes
mr
knight
patches
smiled
friends
this
is
joseph
parkhill
the
only
son
of
the
distinguished
professor
parkhill
whom
you
all
know
so
well
if
patches
had
planned
to
enjoy
the
surprise
his
words
caused
he
could
not
have
been
disappointed
presently
when
joe
had
slipped
away
again
patches
told
them
how
because
of
his
interest
in
the
young
man
and
because
of
the
strange
knowledge
of
professor
parkhill
he
had
written
east
for
the
distinguished
scholar
history
the
professor
himself
was
not
really
so
much
to
blame
said
patches
it
seems
that
he
was
born
to
an
intellectual
life
the
poor
fellow
never
had
a
chance
even
as
a
child
he
was
exhibited
as
a
prodigy
a
shining
example
of
the
possibilities
of
the
race
you
know
his
father
who
was
also
a
professor
of
some
sort
died
when
he
was
a
baby
his
mother
unfortunately
possessed
an
income
sufficient
to
make
it
unnecessary
that
everard
charles
should
ever
do
a
day
real
work
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
was
graduated
from
college
at
the
age
of
he
was
married
to
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
he
was
married
his
landlady
daughter
quite
likely
the
woman
was
ambitious
to
break
into
that
higher
life
to
which
the
professor
aspired
and
caught
her
cultured
opportunity
in
an
unguarded
moment
the
details
are
not
clear
but
when
their
only
child
joe
was
six
years
old
the
mother
ran
away
with
a
carpenter
who
had
been
at
work
on
the
house
for
some
six
weeks
a
maiden
aunt
of
some
fifty
years
who
was
a
worshiper
of
the
professor
cult
came
to
keep
his
house
and
to
train
joe
in
the
way
that
good
boys
should
go
but
the
lad
proved
rather
too
great
a
burden
and
when
he
was
thirteen
they
sent
him
to
a
school
out
here
in
the
west
ostensibly
for
the
benefit
of
the
climate
the
boy
it
was
said
being
of
abnormal
mentality
needed
to
pursue
his
studies
under
the
most
favorable
physical
conditions
the
professor
unhampered
by
his
offspring
continued
to
climb
his
aesthetic
ladder
to
intellectual
and
cultured
glory
the
boy
in
due
time
escaped
from
the
school
and
was
educated
by
the
man
dryden
and
nick
cambert
and
what
will
become
of
him
now
asked
the
dean
patches
smiled
why
the
lad
is
now
and
we
have
agreed
that
it
is
about
time
that
he
began
to
make
a
man
of
himself
i
can
help
him
a
little
perhaps
i
have
been
trying
occasionally
the
past
year
but
you
see
the
conditions
have
not
been
altogether
favorable
to
the
experiment
it
should
be
easy
from
now
on
during
the
time
that
intervened
before
the
trial
of
the
tailholt
mountain
man
phil
and
patches
that
intimate
friendship
of
those
first
months
of
their
work
together
then
came
the
evening
when
phil
went
across
the
meadow
to
ask
jim
reid
for
his
daughter
the
big
cattleman
looked
at
his
young
neighbor
with
frowning
disapproval
it
wo
do
phil
he
said
at
last
i
kitty
father
and
it
up
to
me
to
look
out
for
her
interests
you
know
how
i
educated
her
for
something
better
than
this
life
she
may
think
now
that
she
is
to
throw
it
all
away
but
i
know
better
the
time
would
come
when
she
would
be
miserable
it
got
to
be
somethin
more
than
a
common
for
kitty
phil
and
that
the
truth
the
cowboy
did
not
argue
do
i
understand
that
your
only
objection
is
based
upon
the
business
in
which
i
am
engaged
he
asked
coolly
jim
laughed
the
in
which
you
are
engaged
why
boy
you
sound
like
a
first
national
bank
if
you
had
any
business
of
your
own
if
you
was
the
owner
of
an
outfit
an
could
give
kitty
the
well
the
things
her
education
has
taught
her
to
need
it
would
be
different
i
know
you
a
fine
man
all
right
but
you
only
a
poor
just
the
same
i
speakin
for
your
own
good
phil
as
well
as
for
kitty
he
added
with
an
effort
at
kindliness
then
if
i
had
a
good
business
it
would
be
different
yes
son
it
would
sure
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
thank
you
said
the
cowboy
quietly
as
he
handed
reid
a
very
legal
looking
envelope
i
happen
to
be
half
owner
of
this
ranch
and
outfit
with
my
own
property
it
makes
a
fairly
good
start
for
a
man
of
my
age
my
partner
lawrence
knight
leaves
the
active
management
wholly
in
my
hands
and
he
has
abundant
capital
to
increase
our
holdings
and
enlarge
our
operations
just
as
fast
as
we
can
handle
the
business
the
big
man
looked
from
the
papers
to
the
lad
then
back
to
the
papers
then
a
broad
smile
lighted
his
heavy
face
as
he
said
i
give
it
up
you
win
you
young
fellers
are
too
swift
for
me
i
been
to
retire
anyway
he
raised
his
voice
and
called
kitty
oh
kitty
the
girl
appeared
in
the
doorway
come
and
get
him
said
reid
i
guess
he
yours
helen
manning
was
sitting
on
the
front
porch
of
that
little
cottage
on
the
mountain
side
where
she
and
stanford
began
their
years
of
a
half
mile
below
she
could
see
the
mining
buildings
that
were
grouped
about
the
shaft
in
picturesque
disorder
above
the
ridge
rose
against
the
sky
it
was
too
far
from
the
great
world
of
cities
some
would
have
said
but
helen
did
not
find
it
so
with
her
books
and
her
music
and
the
great
and
with
the
companionship
of
her
mate
and
the
dreams
they
dreamed
together
her
woman
heart
was
never
lonely
she
lowered
the
book
she
was
reading
and
looked
through
the
open
window
to
the
clock
in
the
a
little
while
and
she
would
go
down
the
hill
to
stanford
for
they
loved
to
walk
home
together
then
before
lifting
the
printed
page
again
she
looked
over
the
wide
view
of
rugged
mountain
sides
and
towering
peaks
that
every
day
held
for
her
some
new
beauty
she
had
resumed
her
reading
when
the
sound
of
horses
feet
attracted
her
attention
patches
and
yavapai
joe
were
riding
up
the
hill
they
stopped
at
the
gate
and
while
joe
held
stranger
bridle
rein
patches
came
to
helen
as
she
stood
on
the
porch
waiting
to
receive
him
surely
you
will
stay
for
the
night
she
urged
when
they
had
exchanged
greetings
and
had
talked
for
a
little
while
no
he
answered
quietly
i
just
came
this
way
to
say
i
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
with
stan
at
the
office
he
said
i
would
find
you
here
but
where
are
you
going
she
asked
smiling
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
mountain
ridge
above
just
over
the
sky
line
helen
but
larry
you
will
come
again
you
wo
let
us
lose
you
altogether
perhaps
some
day
he
said
and
who
is
that
with
you
just
a
friend
who
cares
to
go
with
me
stan
will
tell
you
oh
larry
larry
what
a
man
you
are
she
cried
proudly
as
he
stood
before
her
holding
out
his
hand
if
you
think
so
helen
i
am
glad
he
answered
and
turned
away
so
she
watched
him
go
sitting
there
at
home
she
watched
him
ride
up
the
winding
road
now
he
was
in
full
view
on
some
rocky
shoulder
of
the
mountain
now
some
turn
carried
him
behind
a
rocky
point
again
she
glimpsed
him
through
the
trees
again
he
was
lost
to
her
in
the
shadows
at
last
for
a
moment
he
stood
out
boldly
against
the
sky
and
then
he
had
passed
from
sight
over
the
sky
line
as
he
had
said
the
end
