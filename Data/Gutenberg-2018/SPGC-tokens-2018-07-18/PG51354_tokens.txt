patty
knew
that
a
momentous
decision
lay
before
her
page
a
moment
patty
thought
then
she
facing
page
said
no
thank
you
billee
i
don
t
patty

sweet
voice
charmed
by
its
sympathy
tell
me
if
you
told
aunty

chapter
i
an
invitation
i
think
labour
day
is
an
awfully
funny
holiday
remarked
patty
it
doesn
t
seem
to
mean
anything
it
doesn
t
commemorate
anybody
s
birth
or
death
or
it
s
like
bank
holiday
in
england
said
her
father
merely
to
give
the
poor
tired
business
man
a
well
you
don
t
specially
need
one
daddy
you
ve
recreated
a
lot
this
summer
and
it
s
done
you
good
re
looking
isn
t
he
said
nan
smiling
at
the
finely
tanned
face
of
her
husband
the
fairfields
were
down
at
the
pebbles
their
summer
home
at
the
seashore
and
patty
who
had
spent
much
of
the
season
in
new
england
had
come
down
for
a
fortnight
with
her
parents
labour
day
was
early
this
year
and
the
warm
september
sun
was
more
like
that
of
midsummer
the
place
was
looking
lovely
and
patty
herself
made
a
pretty
picture
as
she
lounged
in
a
big
couch
hammock
on
the
wide
veranda
she
had
on
a
white
summer
frock
and
a
silk
sweater
of
an
exquisite
shade
of
salmon
pink
her
silk
stockings
were
of
the
same
shade
and
her
white
pumps
were
immaculate
fairfield
looked
at
the
dainty
feet
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
hammock
and
said
teasingly
i
ve
heard
patty
that
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
women
those
who
have
small
feet
and
those
who
wear
white
patty
surveyed
the
feet
in
question
you
can
t
start
anything
dad
she
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
s
only
one
kind
of
women
today
for
they
all
wear
white
shoes
and
my
feets
are
small
for
my
age
i
wear
fours
and
that
s
not
much
for
a
great
big
girl
like
deed
it
isn
t
patty
said
nan
your
feet
are
very
slender
and
pretty
and
your
white
shoes
are
always
white
which
is
not
a
universal
condition
by
any
you
re
a
great
comfort
nan
and
patty
smiled
at
her
stepmother
dunno
what
i
d
do
without
you
when
the
governor
tries
to
take
a
rise
out
of
oh
i
ll
buy
your
flowers
little
girl
and
nan
smiled
back
for
there
was
great
friendship
and
chumminess
between
these
two
are
you
tired
pats
you
washed
out
you
mean
and
patty
grinned
no
i
m
not
exactly
tired
but
i
ve
been
oh
then
of
course
you
re
exhausted
you
oughtn
t
to
think
patty
huh
but
listen
here
this
is
monday
and
between
now
and
saturday
night
i
ve
got
to
go
to
fourteen
different
functions
of
more
or
less
grandeur
and
gaiety
fourteen
and
not
one
can
i
escape
without
making
the
other
thirteen
mad
at
me
but
patty
said
fairfield
that
s
ridiculous
of
course
you
can
refuse
such
invitations
as
you
of
course
i
can
t
lord
chesterfield
i
ve
got
to
show
up
at
every
blessed
one
not
at
any
i
d
like
to
cut
the
whole
caboodle
why
don
t
you
asked
nan
just
retire
into
solitude
and
i
ll
say
you
re
suffering
temporary
mental
aberration
laughed
patty
no
that
wouldn
t
suit
me
at
all
why
this
afternoon
i
m
going
to
a
garden
tea
that
i
wouldn
t
miss
for
a
farm
there
s
to
be
a
new
man
there
well
just
about
the
last
thing
you
need
on
this
earth
is
a
new
man
declared
her
father
you
ve
a
man
for
every
day
in
the
week
now
with
two
thrown
in
for
patty
looked
demure
i
can
t
help
it
she
said
i
m
that
entertaining
you
know
but
this
new
man
is
a
corker
my
child
what
langwich
what
langwich
tisn
t
mine
that
the
way
he
was
described
to
me
so
of
course
i
want
to
see
if
he
any
good
and
you
won
t
believe
it
but
his
name
is
chick
channing
what
yes
it
is
chickering
channing
for
long
chick
for
what
his
mother
thinking
of
dunno
prob
ly
he
was
named
for
a
rich
uncle
and
she
couldn
t
help
the
who
is
he
one
of
mona
s
western
friends
arrives
today
for
a
week
or
so
mona
s
tea
is
in
his
honour
though
she
was
going
to
have
it
well
said
fairfield
judicially
of
course
you
must
go
to
that
tea
and
subjugate
that
young
man
then
have
him
over
here
and
i
ll
size
him
up
if
you
want
him
i
ll
buy
him
for
thank
you
dear
father
but
i
have
toys
enough
well
then
tonight
is
the
country
club
ball
and
i
do
hate
that
for
there
are
so
many
uninteresting
people
at
it
and
you
have
to
dance
with
most
of
them
and
tomorrow
there
s
a
poky
old
luncheon
at
miss
gardiner
s
i
want
to
go
to
that
i
wish
i
could
elope
why
don
t
you
patty
said
nan
sympathetically
cut
it
all
and
run
up
to
adele
s
or
some
nice
quiet
adele
s
a
quiet
place
not
much
even
gayer
than
spring
beach
and
anyway
it
isn
t
eloping
if
you
go
alone
i
want
to
elope
with
a
romeo
or
something
exciting
like
that
well
for
goodness
gracious
sakes
alive
will
you
look
who
s
coming
up
the
walk
they
followed
the
direction
of
patty
s
dancing
blue
eyes
and
saw
a
big
man
very
big
and
very
smiling
walking
up
the
gravel
path
with
a
long
swinging
stride
little
billee
patty
cried
jumping
up
and
holding
out
both
hands
wherever
did
you
descend
from
didn
t
descend
came
up
up
from
the
south
at
break
of
day
to
be
exact
how
do
you
do
fairfield
how
are
you
sir
farnsworth
s
kindly
breezy
manner
condoned
his
lack
of
conventional
formality
and
with
an
easy
grace
he
disposed
his
big
bulk
in
a
deep
and
roomy
wicker
porch
chair
and
how
s
the
giddy
butterfly
he
said
turning
to
patty
still
making
two
smiles
grow
where
one
was
before
still
breaking
hearts
and
binding
them
up
again
yes
and
she
dimpled
at
him
and
i
have
a
one
to
break
this
afternoon
isn
t
that
fine
fine
for
the
fortunate
owner
of
the
heart
yes
any
man
worthy
of
the
name
would
rather
have
his
heart
broken
by
patty
fairfield
die
in
a
better
land
hobson
s
choice
said
fairfield
drily
are
you
here
for
a
time
farnsworth
glad
to
have
you
stay
with
thank
you
sir
but
i
m
on
the
wing
i
expected
to
spend
the
holiday
properly
fishing
at
barnegat
but
a
telegram
calls
me
up
to
maine
instanter
i
just
dropped
off
here
over
one
train
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
little
sunshine
and
make
sure
she
s
behaving
i
m
a
angel
declared
patty
with
a
heavenward
gaze
and
bill
what
do
you
think
i
was
just
saying
i
wanted
to
elope
now
here
you
are
why
don
t
i
elope
with
you
if
it
must
be
some
one
it
might
as
well
be
me
returned
farnsworth
gravely
have
you
a
rope
ladder
handy
always
keep
one
on
hand
returned
patty
gaily
when
do
we
start
right
away
now
if
you
re
going
with
me
and
bill
laughed
as
patty
sat
up
straight
and
tied
her
sweater
sash
and
pretended
to
get
ready
to
go
but
this
is
the
strange
part
he
went
on
you
all
think
i
m
fooling
but
i
m
not
i
do
want
to
carry
patty
off
with
me
on
this
very
next
this
is
so
sudden
said
patty
still
taking
it
as
a
joke
you
keep
still
a
minute
milady
and
let
me
explain
to
your
elders
and
patty
pouted
at
this
but
bill
went
on
you
see
fairfield
i
m
involved
in
some
big
business
transactions
which
not
to
go
into
details
have
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
become
the
owner
of
a
large
hotel
up
in
maine
the
lake
i
thought
all
maine
was
lakey
put
in
patty
well
this
is
a
smallish
lake
not
far
from
poland
spring
and
it
s
a
big
hotel
and
it
s
to
close
tomorrow
and
all
the
guests
will
leave
then
and
i
ve
got
to
go
up
there
and
look
after
how
did
you
happen
to
acquire
this
white
elephant
asked
fred
fairfield
greatly
interested
had
to
take
it
for
a
debt
man
couldn
t
pay
his
money
in
war
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
while
patty
s
getting
her
bag
what
do
you
mean
cried
nan
seeing
farnsworth
s
apparent
sincerity
oh
lord
i
forgot
i
haven
t
told
you
yet
well
as
i
have
to
go
up
there
for
a
week
or
two
and
as
the
hotel
is
all
in
running
order
and
as
all
the
guests
are
going
off
in
a
hurry
and
the
servants
are
still
there
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
have
a
sort
of
a
house
party
up
gorgeous
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
who
s
going
bill
that
s
the
rub
i
haven
t
asked
anybody
yet
and
i
doubt
if
i
can
get
many
at
this
time
of
haven
t
asked
anybody
i
thought
you
had
planned
this
house
party
well
you
see
i
just
got
the
telegram
last
night
and
it
was
on
the
train
coming
up
here
this
morning
that
i
planned
the
plans
aren
t
entirely
completed
as
oh
you
fraud
you
made
it
all
up
on
the
spur
of
the
yes
m
i
did
but
what
a
spur
the
moment
is
now
see
here
it
s
clear
sailing
we
can
get
the
kenerleys
and
they
ll
be
the
chaperons
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
corral
a
few
guests
you
and
i
are
two
how
about
mona
galbraith
she
d
go
if
she
could
said
patty
but
she
s
having
a
party
this
afternoon
chick
channing
is
over
chick
channing
is
he
really
well
well
i
haven
t
seen
that
boy
for
years
we
must
make
them
come
and
daisy
is
she
there
yet
but
don
t
get
too
many
don
t
be
alarmed
you
little
you
the
farringtons
will
go
maybe
and
kit
cameron
and
his
pretty
cousin
oh
i
ve
a
list
of
possibles
and
we
ll
get
enough
for
a
jolly
little
crowd
you
ve
no
objections
have
you
and
farnsworth
looked
anxiously
at
the
elder
fairfields
began
nan
but
it
isn
t
all
clear
to
me
yet
suppose
the
kenerleys
can
t
go
that
puts
the
whole
plant
out
of
commission
unless
by
jove
wouldn
t
you
two
go
that
would
be
fine
but
fairfield
and
nan
refused
to
be
drawn
into
any
such
crazy
scheme
it
was
all
right
for
young
people
they
said
but
not
for
a
pair
well
i
ll
tell
you
said
farnsworth
after
a
moment
s
thought
i
ll
get
the
kens
on
the
long
distance
and
find
out
for
sure
meantime
butterfly
you
be
packing
a
few
feathers
for
sumpum
tells
me
adele
will
go
anyway
whether
old
jim
does
or
might
as
well
throw
some
things
in
a
suitcase
i
s
pose
said
patty
it
s
better
to
be
ready
and
not
go
than
to
go
and
not
be
after
a
long
session
at
the
telephone
bill
announced
a
triumphant
success
the
kenerleys
would
be
glad
to
go
moreover
adele
would
meet
patty
and
bill
in
new
york
that
very
day
in
time
for
a
late
luncheon
then
they
would
get
the
farringtons
and
the
others
by
telephone
then
patty
would
go
home
with
adele
for
the
night
and
they
would
all
go
to
maine
the
next
day
you
see
it
s
very
simple
said
bill
with
such
an
ingenuous
smile
that
nan
went
over
to
his
side
at
once
of
course
it
is
she
agreed
it
s
simply
lovely
and
patty
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
giddy
whirl
down
here
she
ll
have
the
time
of
her
life
but
fairfield
was
not
so
sure
i
think
it
s
a
wild
goose
chase
he
said
what
sort
of
a
place
are
you
going
to
you
don
t
know
what
sort
of
service
and
creature
comforts
you
don
t
know
what
will
you
get
to
eat
you
don
t
know
that
s
a
nice
sort
of
outlook
i
must
say
oh
easy
now
sir
it
isn
t
as
bad
as
all
that
i
ve
had
rather
definite
and
detailed
reports
and
if
it
weren
t
all
comfy
and
certain
i
wouldn
t
take
patty
up
there
it
s
a
lark
you
see
a
lark
i
m
sure
we
ll
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
it
and
incidentally
i
know
it
s
a
fine
section
of
country
invigourating
and
all
that
and
the
house
is
a
modern
hotel
they
always
close
soon
after
labour
day
but
this
year
owing
to
circumstances
it
s
the
very
day
after
that
s
where
the
fun
comes
in
having
a
whole
hotel
all
to
ourselves
but
we
must
be
getting
on
the
train
leaves
in
twenty
i
m
all
ready
said
patty
as
she
miraculously
transformed
into
a
lady
garbed
for
travelling
a
silk
pongee
coat
protected
her
gown
and
a
small
hat
and
veil
completed
a
smart
costume
i
don
t
altogether
like
began
fairfield
as
they
got
into
the
motor
to
go
to
the
train
run
along
patty
said
nan
i
ll
see
to
it
that
he
does
like
it
before
you
leave
the
station
going
to
mona
s
yes
just
for
a
minute
you
see
her
as
soon
as
we
re
gone
and
tell
her
all
about
it
we
can
only
say
the
barest
they
flew
off
patty
s
veil
streaming
behind
until
she
drew
it
in
and
tied
it
round
her
neck
at
red
chimneys
several
young
people
were
playing
tennis
but
patty
called
mona
to
her
and
told
her
briefly
of
the
plan
glorious
cried
mona
if
it
were
not
for
that
old
tea
we
could
go
right
along
now
but
we
ll
come
tomorrow
where
shall
we
meet
you
quickly
farnsworth
told
her
and
then
turned
to
see
his
old
friend
channing
chick
old
boy
he
cried
my
but
it
s
good
to
see
you
again
channing
was
presented
to
patty
who
looked
at
him
in
amazement
he
was
the
biggest
man
she
had
ever
seen
even
taller
than
bill
farnsworth
he
looked
enormously
strong
and
when
he
smiled
his
large
mouth
parted
to
show
two
rows
of
big
white
even
teeth
that
somehow
made
patty
feel
like
red
ridinghood
before
the
wolf
but
there
was
little
time
for
getting
acquainted
for
it
was
almost
train
time
a
few
words
between
the
two
men
as
to
meeting
next
day
and
then
the
motor
flew
to
the
station
and
only
just
in
time
for
though
bill
handed
patty
on
to
the
steps
with
care
he
had
to
scramble
up
himself
as
the
train
was
about
to
start
how
do
you
like
eloping
he
said
smilingly
as
they
rolled
away
fine
said
patty
dimpling
but
must
it
always
be
done
in
quite
such
a
hurry
not
always
next
time
we
ll
take
it
easier
now
let
s
make
a
list
of
our
house
farnsworth
took
out
a
notebook
and
pencil
and
they
suggested
various
names
some
of
which
they
decided
for
and
some
against
at
last
patty
said
in
an
assured
tone
and
phil
van
not
on
your
life
exclaimed
bill
if
he
goes
don
t
why
little
billee
we
couldn
t
have
the
party
at
all
without
then
you
ll
have
it
without
see
patty
pouted
i
don
t
see
why
he
s
an
awfully
nice
man
i
oh
you
do
do
you
why
don
t
you
stay
home
then
and
have
him
down
at
the
seashore
to
visit
you
oh
that
wouldn
t
be
half
as
much
fun
but
up
there
is
that
lovely
place
all
woodsy
and
lakey
and
sunsetty
i
could
have
a
splendid
time
if
i
had
all
my
friends
around
patty
s
sweet
face
looked
very
wistful
and
farnsworth
scanned
it
closely
does
it
mean
so
much
as
that
to
you
patty
if
it
does
you
shall
have
him
oh
i
don
t
care
it
s
your
party
do
just
as
you
because
it
s
my
party
i
want
to
do
just
as
bill
spoke
very
kindly
and
patty
rewarded
him
with
a
flash
of
her
blue
eyes
and
the
subject
was
dropped
chapter
ii
the
hotel
this
is
a
little
like
a
real
eloping
isn
t
it
and
bill
gave
patty
s
suitcase
to
a
porter
whom
they
followed
across
the
big
pennsylvania
station
in
new
york
a
little
said
patty
shaking
her
head
you
see
it
lacks
the
thrill
of
a
real
elopement
because
people
know
about
it
an
elopement
to
be
any
good
must
be
a
secret
if
ever
i
get
married
i
m
going
to
elope
that
s
one
thing
certain
why
patty
how
unlike
you
i
thought
you
d
want
a
flubdub
wedding
with
leven
bridesmaids
and
all
the
rest
of
oh
i
s
pect
i
shall
when
the
time
comes
i
often
change
my
mind
you
you
bet
you
do
you
change
it
oftener
than
you
make
it
up
why
i
couldn
began
patty
and
just
then
they
reached
the
taxicab
rank
and
bill
put
patty
into
a
car
they
went
to
the
waldorf
where
they
were
to
meet
the
kenerleys
and
found
that
jim
and
adele
had
just
arrived
what
a
perfect
scheme
exclaimed
adele
as
soon
as
greetings
had
been
exchanged
who
all
are
going
let
us
go
to
luncheon
said
bill
and
then
we
can
thrash
out
things
i
reserved
a
here
we
are
as
the
head
waiter
recognised
the
big
westerner
i
love
to
go
round
with
bill
said
patty
he
always
has
everything
ready
and
no
fuss
about
he
sure
does
said
jim
kenerley
in
hearty
appreciation
but
the
way
he
scoots
across
the
country
and
back
every
other
day
or
two
keeps
him
in
trim
he
lives
on
the
i
do
agreed
farnsworth
but
some
day
i
hope
to
arrange
matters
so
i
can
stay
in
the
same
place
twice
laughing
at
this
sally
they
took
their
places
at
the
table
which
bill
s
foresight
had
caused
to
be
decorated
with
a
low
mound
of
white
asters
and
maidenhair
fern
how
pretty
cried
patty
i
hate
a
tall
decoration
is
just
right
to
talk
over
now
let
s
and
talk
they
did
i
just
flew
off
patty
declared
as
she
told
adele
about
it
nan
s
going
to
pack
a
trunk
and
send
it
when
she
knows
we
re
truly
there
i
think
she
feared
the
plan
would
fizzle
indeed
it
won
t
bill
assured
them
we
ve
got
the
nucleus
of
our
party
here
and
if
we
can
t
get
any
more
we
can
go
it
but
it
was
by
no
means
difficult
to
get
the
others
some
few
whom
they
asked
were
out
of
town
but
they
responded
to
long
distance
calls
and
most
of
them
accepted
the
unusual
invitation
farnsworth
had
a
table
telephone
brought
and
as
fast
as
they
could
ring
them
up
they
asked
their
guests
the
two
farringtons
were
glad
to
go
marie
homer
and
kit
cameron
jumped
at
the
chance
mona
and
daisy
with
chick
channing
would
come
up
from
the
shore
the
next
day
and
that
made
eleven
van
reypen
asked
kenerley
as
they
sought
for
some
one
to
fill
out
the
dozen
up
to
patty
said
bill
glancing
at
her
no
and
patty
shook
her
golden
head
slowly
no
don
t
let
s
ask
phil
this
why
not
said
adele
in
astonishment
i
thought
you
liked
i
do
phil
s
a
dear
but
i
just
don
t
want
him
on
this
picnic
besides
he
s
probably
out
of
town
and
likely
he
wouldn
t
care
to
reasons
enough
said
farnsworth
briefly
cross
off
van
reypen
now
who
for
our
last
man
peyton
said
jim
bob
peyton
would
love
to
go
and
he
s
a
good
round
chap
how
s
that
bill
all
right
patty
and
bill
looked
inquiringly
at
her
yes
indeed
peyton
s
a
jolly
man
do
you
think
he
d
go
adele
like
a
shot
kenerley
replied
for
his
wife
bob
s
rather
gone
on
patty
if
you
know
what
i
who
gone
on
patty
returned
farnsworth
well
that
s
a
round
dozen
enough
plenty
patty
decreed
and
then
the
talk
turned
to
matters
of
trains
and
meetings
and
luggage
i
ll
arrange
everything
for
the
picnic
said
bill
you
girls
see
about
your
clothes
and
that
s
all
you
need
bother
about
you
ll
want
warmish
togs
it
gets
cool
up
there
after
sundown
remember
it
s
maine
patty
and
adele
at
once
began
to
discuss
what
to
take
and
patty
made
a
list
to
send
to
nan
for
immediate
shipment
what
an
enormous
piece
of
humanity
that
chicky
is
said
patty
suddenly
remembering
the
stranger
do
you
know
him
jim
yes
known
him
for
years
he
s
true
blue
every
inch
of
him
don
t
you
like
him
patty
can
t
say
yet
i
only
saw
him
half
a
jiffy
but
yes
i
m
sure
i
shall
like
him
bill
says
he
s
salt
of
the
he
s
all
of
that
and
maybe
a
little
pepper
as
well
but
you
and
old
chick
will
be
chums
i
promise
you
now
we
ll
pack
you
two
girls
off
to
fern
falls
and
i
ll
do
a
few
man
s
size
errands
and
bill
here
will
make
his
will
and
dispose
of
his
estate
before
going
off
into
the
wilderness
with
a
horde
of
wild
indians
then
tomorrow
he
ll
pick
us
up
at
fern
falls
and
we
ll
all
go
on
our
way
not
so
fast
said
adele
after
jim
finished
his
speech
you
two
men
can
go
where
you
like
patty
and
i
will
take
a
taxi
and
do
some
last
fond
lingering
bits
of
shopping
before
we
go
home
don
t
you
s
pose
we
want
some
shoes
and
veils
asked
farnsworth
laughing
all
right
you
ladies
go
and
buy
your
millinery
and
i
ll
see
you
again
tomorrow
on
the
as
might
have
been
expected
with
such
capable
management
everything
went
on
smoothly
and
it
was
a
clear
bright
afternoon
when
they
completed
the
last
stage
of
their
journey
and
the
train
from
portland
set
them
down
at
their
destination
not
quite
at
their
destination
however
for
motorbuses
were
in
waiting
to
take
them
to
the
hotel
itself
for
more
than
an
hour
they
bumped
or
glided
over
the
varying
roads
now
through
woods
and
now
through
clearing
at
last
a
vista
suddenly
opened
before
them
and
they
saw
a
most
picturesque
lake
its
dark
waters
touched
here
and
there
by
the
setting
sun
it
was
bordered
by
towering
pines
and
spruces
and
purple
hills
rose
in
the
distance
stunning
cried
patty
standing
up
in
the
car
to
see
better
i
never
saw
such
a
theatrical
lake
it
s
like
grand
opera
or
like
the
castled
crag
of
drachenfels
whatever
that
i
used
to
recite
that
at
school
observed
chick
channing
so
it
must
be
all
right
whatever
it
and
then
as
they
turned
a
corner
the
hotel
itself
appeared
in
sight
an
enormous
structure
not
far
from
the
lake
and
set
in
a
mass
of
brilliant
salvias
and
other
autumn
flowers
and
surrounded
by
velvety
greensward
what
a
peach
of
a
hotel
and
patty
s
eyes
danced
with
enthusiasm
and
admiration
all
for
us
little
billee
all
for
we
room
enough
i
should
say
so
i
m
going
to
have
a
suite
two
everybody
can
have
all
the
rooms
he
wants
and
then
some
i
believe
there
are
about
five
what
cried
daisy
dow
five
hundred
i
shall
have
a
dozen
at
least
what
fun
the
cars
rolled
up
to
the
main
entrance
doormen
porters
and
hallboys
appeared
and
the
laughing
crowd
trooped
merrily
up
the
steps
i
never
had
such
a
lark
declared
mona
oh
i
ve
seen
hotels
as
big
bigger
never
had
one
all
to
myself
so
to
speak
isn
t
it
just
like
big
bill
to
get
up
this
picnic
marie
homer
looked
a
little
scared
the
vastness
of
the
place
seemed
to
awe
her
chr
up
marie
laughed
her
cousin
kit
cameron
you
don
t
have
to
use
any
more
rooms
than
you
want
how
shall
we
pick
our
quarters
farnsworth
well
let
me
see
and
kenerley
must
select
their
rooms
first
then
the
ladies
of
the
party
and
if
there
are
any
rooms
left
after
that
we
fellows
will
bunk
in
so
followed
by
the
whole
laughing
troop
adele
and
jim
chose
their
apartments
they
selected
two
elaborate
suites
on
the
second
floor
for
bill
told
them
that
there
were
scores
of
servants
and
they
were
better
off
if
they
had
work
to
do
isn
t
it
heavenly
sighed
elise
farrington
dropping
for
a
moment
on
a
cushioned
in
adele
s
and
gazing
at
the
beautiful
view
i
want
my
rooms
on
this
side
of
the
house
all
the
girls
on
this
side
decreed
adele
and
all
the
men
on
the
other
or
if
the
men
want
a
lake
view
they
can
go
up
on
the
next
floor
if
i
have
to
comfort
you
girls
when
you
re
weeping
with
homesickness
i
want
you
near
by
marie
you
re
most
addicted
to
nostalgia
i
recommend
you
take
this
suite
next
to
so
marie
was
installed
in
a
lovely
apartment
next
adele
s
and
with
practically
the
same
view
of
the
lake
and
hills
daisy
s
came
next
then
mona
s
and
patty
s
last
this
brought
patty
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
house
and
just
suited
her
for
she
said
there
s
a
balcony
to
this
suite
and
if
i
feel
romantic
i
can
come
out
here
and
bay
the
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
young
woman
said
adele
severely
you
do
that
act
and
you
ll
be
kidnapped
no
thank
you
and
patty
shuddered
i
ve
had
quite
enough
of
that
the
rooms
were
beautifully
furnished
in
good
taste
and
harmonious
colourings
the
hotel
had
been
planned
on
an
elaborate
scale
but
for
some
reason
probably
connected
with
the
management
had
not
been
successful
in
this
its
first
season
and
in
swinging
a
business
deal
of
some
big
lumber
tracts
in
that
vicinity
it
had
fallen
into
farnsworth
s
hands
he
had
no
intention
of
keeping
it
but
intended
to
sell
it
to
advantage
but
at
present
it
was
his
own
property
and
he
had
conceived
the
whim
of
this
picnic
boom
boom
sounded
channing
s
deep
bass
voice
in
the
hall
that
s
the
people
dinner
in
half
an
hour
no
full
dress
tonight
just
a
fresh
blouse
and
a
flower
in
your
hair
isn
t
he
great
said
patty
to
mona
as
they
responded
through
their
closed
doors
but
the
girls
suites
of
rooms
could
all
be
made
to
communicate
and
they
ran
back
and
forth
without
using
the
main
hall
he
is
agreed
mona
who
was
brushing
her
hair
at
patty
s
and
the
more
you
see
of
him
the
better
you
ll
like
him
he
s
shy
at
shy
that
great
big
thing
shy
yes
he
tries
to
conceal
it
but
he
is
not
with
men
you
know
afraid
of
girls
don
t
tease
him
me
tease
him
and
patty
looked
like
an
injured
saint
i
m
going
to
be
a
fairy
godmother
to
him
i
ll
take
care
of
him
and
shield
him
from
you
hoydens
with
your
wiles
now
go
to
your
own
rooms
mona
i
should
think
with
half
a
dozen
perfectly
good
rooms
of
your
own
you
might
let
me
have
i
can
t
bear
to
leave
you
patty
you
re
not
much
to
look
at
know
somehow
i
forget
your
plainness
mona
dodged
a
that
patty
threw
at
her
and
ran
away
to
her
own
rooms
half
an
hour
later
patty
went
slowly
down
the
grand
staircase
adele
had
decreed
no
evening
dress
that
first
night
so
patty
wore
a
little
afternoon
frock
of
flowered
dresden
silk
it
was
simply
made
with
a
full
skirt
and
many
little
flounces
and
yellowed
lace
ruffles
fell
away
from
her
pretty
throat
and
soft
dimpled
arms
its
pale
colouring
and
crisp
frilliness
suited
well
her
dainty
type
and
she
looked
a
picture
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
halfway
down
the
stairs
well
if
you
aren
t
a
sight
for
gods
and
little
fishes
exclaimed
a
deep
voice
and
patty
saw
chickering
channing
gazing
at
her
from
the
hall
below
come
on
down
me
eat
as
patty
reached
the
last
step
he
grasped
her
lightly
with
his
two
hands
and
swung
her
to
the
floor
beside
him
well
exclaimed
patty
decidedly
taken
aback
at
this
performance
will
you
wait
a
minute
while
i
revise
my
estimate
of
you
for
better
or
worse
that
sounds
like
can
t
think
of
independence
i
wrong
it
s
from
the
declaration
of
dependence
but
why
revise
oh
i
ve
ticketed
you
all
wrong
mona
said
you
were
shy
methinks
the
roguish
mona
was
guying
you
shyness
is
my
strong
point
but
if
you
prefer
it
should
be
i
ll
cultivate
it
till
i
can
shy
with
the
best
of
them
would
you
like
me
better
shy
indeed
i
should
if
only
to
save
me
the
trouble
of
that
shy
it
is
whereupon
channing
began
to
fidget
and
stand
on
one
foot
then
the
other
and
even
managed
to
blush
as
he
stammered
out
i
miss
it
was
such
a
perfect
yet
not
overdone
burlesque
of
an
embarrassed
youth
that
patty
broke
into
peals
of
laughter
don
t
she
cried
be
yourself
whatever
it
is
i
can
t
revise
back
and
forth
every
two
minutes
i
say
chickering
channing
you
re
going
to
be
great
fun
aren
t
you
bid
me
to
live
and
i
will
live
your
funnyman
to
be
whatever
you
desire
i
m
it
so
you
see
i
am
a
nice
handy
man
to
have
in
the
indeed
you
are
i
foresee
we
shall
be
friends
but
what
can
i
call
you
that
whole
title
as
i
just
used
it
is
too
long
for
this
big
you
know
what
the
rest
call
patty
pouted
a
little
i
never
call
people
what
other
people
call
oh
lord
more
trouble
and
chick
rolled
his
eyes
as
if
in
despair
well
choose
a
name
for
no
i
want
one
for
you
oh
what
a
young
miss
well
choose
but
don
t
be
all
night
about
it
and
i
warn
you
if
i
don
t
like
it
i
won
t
let
you
use
oh
my
murmured
patty
well
i
shall
call
you
chickadee
whether
you
like
it
or
oh
i
like
it
it
but
nearly
as
many

and
i
shan
t
speak
to

until
i
ve
thought
of
nonchalantly
turning
aside
patty
walked
across
the
great
hall
to
where
a
few
of
the
others
had
already
gathered
pretty
patty
said
kit

shortly
and
then
she

about

iii
a
midnight
message
dinner
in
the
big
was
great
fun
a
large
round
table
had
been
prepared
for
the
party
and
the
smaller
unoccupied
tables
all
about
were
also
decorated
with
flowers
to
give
a
festive
atmosphere
as
there
were
scores
of
idle
waiters
each
of
the
party
could
have
one
or
more
if
desired
farnsworth
seated
his
guests
i
ll
sit
here
he
announced
and
i
ll
ask
kenerley
to
sit
at
my
right
the
rest
of
you
may
sit
where
you
choose
alternating
of
course
the
girls
and
the
men
now
here
s
my
plan
at
every
meal
the
men
sit
as
we
do
tonight
and
the
ladies
move
one
seat
to
the
right
this
gives
us
new
companions
each
time
and
prevents
here
s
me
said
patty
dropping
into
the
chair
at
bill
s
left
hand
while
channing
sat
the
other
side
of
patty
laughingly
they
all
found
places
and
dinner
was
served
it
was
an
unusual
experience
the
hotel
was
ornate
in
design
and
appointments
and
its
green
and
gold
colouring
and
soft
glow
of
lights
made
a
charming
setting
for
the
merry
party
round
the
big
table
the
other
tables
and
there
were
many
of
them
looked
as
if
they
might
be
occupied
by
the
ghosts
of
the
departed
guests
it
s
like
being
castaways
on
a
beautiful
and
very
comfortable
desert
island
said
patty
as
she
looked
appreciatively
at
a
huge
tray
of
hors
d
œuvre
offered
her
by
a
smiling
waiter
i
do
love
these
things
and
never
before
have
i
felt
that
i
might
take
my
time
in
choosing
but
here
s
the
name
of
the
hotel
bill
never
mind
the
name
on
its
he
returned
we
ll
call
it
freedom
castle
everybody
is
to
follow
his
or
her
own
sweet
will
somebody
else
s
if
that
seems
who
has
the
pleasantest
will
asked
patty
looking
around
i
want
to
follow
i
have
said
chick
promptly
my
will
is
something
fierce
in
the
way
of
pleasantness
i
daresay
every
one
here
will
fall
all
over
themselves
in
their
haste
to
follow
it
ha
do
i
hear
a
familiar
strain
i
do
he
did
for
just
then
the
hotel
orchestra
a
fine
one
struck
up
a
popular
air
music
too
exclaimed
mona
all
the
comforts
of
home
and
none
of
the
cares
this
is
just
too
perfect
billy
boy
you
re
a
wonder
to
think
of
it
being
bill
s
hotel
said
daisy
in
an
awed
voice
to
think
of
our
being
here
without
any
bills
put
in
roger
farrington
that
s
the
best
part
of
it
it
s
like
being
given
the
freedom
of
the
city
the
freedom
of
the
country
adele
corrected
that
s
much
the
orchestra
on
a
platform
gorgeous
in
scarlet
coats
began
a
fascinating
kit
cameron
looked
across
the
table
at
patty
with
a
nod
of
invitation
smiling
assent
patty
rose
flinging
her
napkin
on
the
table
kit
came
round
to
her
and
in
a
moment
they
were
dancing
to
the
music
that
had
called
them
skilfully
kit
guided
her
among
the
maze
of
tables
and
chairs
for
they
were
the
two
best
dancers
in
the
crowd
and
they
had
no
difficulty
in
avoiding
obstacles
have
a
turn
adele
asked
bill
laying
down
his
fork
no
thank
you
it
s
all
very
well
for
the
girls
but
your
chaperon
is
too
nearly
for
such
nonsense
but
maybe
you
re
wise
to
save
your
energies
for
an
evening
several
of
the
young
people
did
dance
a
few
turns
but
chick
channing
speedily
caused
them
to
halt
by
announcing
the
arrival
of
mushrooms
under
glass
whoosh
cried
kit
back
to
nature
we
can
dance
at
any
old
time
but
mushrooms
under
glass
are
an
event
i
say
bill
i
m
glad
the
cook
didn
t
leave
with
the
the
whole
serving
force
is
under
contract
for
a
fortnight
longer
explained
farnsworth
you
can
live
on
mushrooms
if
you
it
s
paradise
said
marie
homer
ecstatically
i
don
t
ever
want
to
go
home
does
the
mail
come
regularly
everybody
laughed
at
marie
s
look
of
anxiety
and
bill
replied
yes
my
child
you
can
get
your
daily
letter
from
him
up
he
doesn
t
write
day
said
marie
so
innocently
that
they
all
roared
again
i
wish
had
somebody
to
write
to
me
sighed
patty
it
must
make
life
very
i
ll
write
them
to
you
offered
chick
it
s
no
trouble
at
all
and
i
m
the
little
old
complete
you
re
right
here
in
the
spot
though
so
that
s
no
fun
i
mean
somebody
who
isn
t
here
marie
s
well
you
must
have
plenty
of
absent
adorers
can
t
you
encourage
their
correspondence
but
then
i
d
have
to
write
first
and
i
hate
to
do
that
it
s
sort
of
that
to
be
sure
but
it
s
better
to
be
forward
than
oh
i
m
not
exactly
forlorn
said
patty
indignantly
i
can
be
happy
with
all
these
others
if
t
other
dear
charmer
can
you
patty
whispered
bill
are
you
happy
here
oho
little
billee
i
am
beatifically
happy
just
see
that
confection
louis
is
bringing
in
could
i
be
anything
but
happy
with
that
ahead
of
me
the
dessert
that
had
just
appeared
was
indeed
a
triumph
of
the
confectioner
s
art
composed
of
ice
cream
meringue
and
spun
sugar
it
was
built
into
an
airy
structure
that
delighted
the
sight
as
well
as
the
palate
everybody
applauded
and
adele
declared
it
was
really
a
shame
to
demolish
it
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
said
patty
her
blue
eyes
dancing
in
anticipation
of
the
delicious
sweet
what
a
little
gourmande
you
are
said
chick
watching
patty
help
herself
bountifully
to
the
dessert
deed
i
am
i
love
sweet
things
they
always
make
me
feel
at
peace
with
the
world
i
eat
them
mostly
for
their
mental
and
moral
effect
on
me
for
my
disposition
is
not
naturally
sweet
and
so
i
do
all
i
can
to
improve
and
yet
you
give
the
effect
of
a
sweet
dispositioned
she
is
spoke
up
daisy
overhearing
why
chick
patty
is
the
sweetest
nature
ever
was
don
t
you
believe
her
i
know
the
lady
so
slightly
i
m
not
much
of
a
judge
but
i
feel
sure
she
ll
improve
on
acquaintance
and
chick
looked
hopeful
i
hope
so
i
m
sure
and
patty
s
humble
expression
of
face
was
belied
by
the
twinkle
in
her
eye
then
dinner
was
over
and
adele
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
great
salon
or
come
for
a
little
walk
on
the
veranda
said
chick
to
patty
let
s
get
more
patty
caught
up
a
wrap
from
the
hall
rack
and
they
went
out
and
strolled
the
length
of
the
long
veranda
that
went
round
three
sides
of
the
house
splendid
crowd
said
chick
enthusiastically
and
right
down
fine
of
old
bill

fine
said
patty
impulsively
whatever
he
does

a
big

reason
to
know
that
he
s
done
heaps
for

or
four
years

engineer

bill

in
his
manœuvres

in
this
glassy
nook
and
flirt
a
bit
they
had
reached
a
portion
of
the
veranda
and
arranged
with
seats
among
tall
palms
and
jars
of
flowers
there
were
shaded
lights
and
a
little
illuminated
fountain
in
the
centre
i
ll
stop
here
a
moment
but
i
can
t
flirt
said
patty
demurely
my
chaperon
won
t
allow

no
fun
anyway
forbidden
fruit
is
but
sour
grapes
are
forbidden
fruit
how
can
sour
be
sweet
oh
it
s
all
according
to
your
nature
if
you
have
a
sour
nature
the
grapes
are
sour
if
a
sweet
disposition
then
all
fruits
are
even
a
lemon
nobody
hands
a
lemon
to
sweet
then
they
can
t
have
any
lemonade
and
i
love
it
i
guess
i
ll
stop
being
so
good
gracious
patty
you
couldn
t
do
if
you
tried
this
remark
was
made
by
kit
cameron
who
just
then
put
his
head
in
at
the
doorway
and
overheard
patty
s
laughing
decision
hello
you
two
he
went
on
you
ll
have
to
stop
your
introspective
conversation
and
come
and
join
the
dance
will
you
won
t
you
come
and
join
the
dance
we
re
only
to
have
one
our
dragon
chaperon
declares
and
then
we
must
all
go
so
come
and
trip
it
patty
of
the
fairy
toes
the
trio
returned
to
the
and
after
the
one
dance
had
been
extended
to
half
a
dozen
adele
collected
her
headstrong
charges
and
carried
them
off
to
bed
and
you
re
not
to
have
kimono
confabs
all
night
either
she
ordered
patty
you
ll
be
good
for
nothing
tomorrow
if
you
don
t
get
some
rest
and
the
others
but
there
was
more
or
less
chattering
and
giggling
before
the
girls
separated
for
the
night
it
seemed
natural
for
them
to
drift
into
patty
s
boudoir
and
in
their
pretty
negligées
they
dawdled
about
while
patty
brushed
her
hair
what
goldilocks
exclaimed
marie
in
admiration
and
truly
patty
s
hair
was
a
thing
to
admire
thick
and
curling
it
hung
well
below
her
waist
and
shone
with
a
golden
glimmer
as
the
light
touched
its
rippling
lengths
it
s
an
awful
nuisance
patty
declared
there
s
such
a
lot
of
it
and
it
does
snarl
let
me
help
you
cried
daisy
springing
up
and
taking
the
brush
from
patty
s
hand
mona
do
the
other
mona
seized
another
brush
and
obeyed
and
as
the
two
brushed
most
vigorously
patty
s
little
head
was
well
pulled
about
thank
you
girls
oh
you
so
much
but
truly
i
mind
doing
it
myself
oh
i
don
t
patty
rescued
her
brushes
and
soon
had
the
rebellious
locks
in
two
long
pigtails
for
the
night
now
scoot
all
of
you
she
said
this
is
the
time

my
weary
limbs

mona

won
t
marie

and
with
murmured
ran
away
going
to

a
letter
of

daisy
wagged
her
sapient
head
who

the
man

daisy

the

away
and
locking
her
door
against
their
possible
return
she
began
to
make
ready
for
bed

glanced
at
her
watch
as
she
sat
at
her
it
was
exactly
midnight
and
at
that
moment
her
telephone
rang
those
girls

thought
to

the
bell
kept
ringing

i
go
alone
you
needn
t
come
alone
bring
a
chaperon
or
another
girl
or
a
crowd
of
people
if
you
like
or
even
a
servant
but
that
s
all
so
little
girl
pleasant
dreams
the
telephone
clicked
as
phil
hung
up
and
with
a
little
gasp
patty
hung
up
her
receiver
and
threw
herself
on
a
couch
to
think
it
over
she
couldn
t
help
laughing
at
the
coil
she
was
in
for
she
well
knew
she
couldn
t
go
to
poland
spring
house
unless
with
the
whole
crowd
nearly
all
of
them
she
pictured
bill
reaching
there
to
be
greeted
by
philip
van
reypen
dear
old
bill
after
all
he
had
done
to
make
it
pleasant
for
them
to
hurt
his
feelings
or
to
annoy
him
in
any
way
would
be
mean
she
wished
phil
had
kept
out
of
it
she
wished
there
wasn
t
any
phil
nor
any
little
billee
somehow
patty
s
long
brown
lashes
drooped
over
her
pansy
blue
eyes
still
robed
in
her
chiffon
and
lace
peignoir
and
all
curled
up
on
the
soft
spacious
couch
fell
sound
asleep
chapter
iv
blue
rock
lake
in
a
blaze
of
september
glory
the
sun
shone
across
the
lake
the
leaves
had
not
yet
begun
to
turn
and
the
summer
trees
were
as
green
as
the
stalwart
evergreens
but
of
varying
shades
from
deep
almost
black
shadowy
forests
the
range
ran
to
brilliant
light
green
foliage
in
a
gamut
of
colour
some
of
the
younger
and
more
daring
trees
crept
down
to
the
water
s
edge
but
much
of
the
lake
shore
was
rocky
and
more
or
less
steep
here
and
there
a
picturesque
inlet
had
a
bit
of
sandy
coast
but
the
main
effect
was
rugged
and
wild
but
even
the
intrusive
sun
could
only
peep
into
patty
s
boudoir
through
a
chink
or
two
between
the
drawn
shades
and
the
window
frames
and
so
his
light
was
not
enough
to
wake
the
sleeper
still
cuddled
among
the
couch
pillows
but
she
was
awakened
by
a
bombardment
of
raps
on
the
door
patty
called
daisy
s
impatient
voice
whatever
you
doing
open
this
door
the
blue
eyes
flew
open
but
patty
was
the
sort
of
person
who
never
wakes
all
at
once
nan
always
said
patty
woke
on
the
instalment
plan
slowly
and
rubbing
her
eyes
she
rose
and
unlocked
the
door
why
patty
fairfield
daisy
exclaimed
your
lights
are
still
burning
at
you
you
didn
t
undress
at
all
you
have
on
your
evening
petticoat
and
slippers
and
the
very
same
boudoir
robe
i
left
you
in
last
night
and
looked
in
at
the
bedroom
door
your
bed
hasn
t
been
slept
in
what
the
matter
daisy
rattled
on
so
that
patty
still
half
asleep
was
bewildered
i
don
t
she
began
philip
philip
called
patty
are
you
crazy
wake
up
daisy
shook
her
a
little
and
under
this
compulsion
patty
finished
waking
up
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
laughing
did
i
sleep
there
all
night
no
wonder
i
feel
like
a
boiled
but
why
did
you
do
it
fiddlesticks
i
don
t
know
it
s
no
crime
i
suppose
i
lay
down
there
for
a
few
minutes
after
you
hoodlums
cleared
out
and
i
suppose
i
fell
asleep
and
forgot
to
wake
up
that
s
all
lem
me
alone
and
a
bath
and
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
will
restore
my
you
dear
little
goose
i
ll
run
your
tub
for
you
though
i
suppose
there
are
a
string
of
maids
waiting
outside
your
door
want
em
no
rather
have
you
but
send
half
a
dozen
of
them
for
some
choclit
still
yawning
patty
began
to
take
off
her
slippers
and
stockings
thank
you
daisykins
she
said
as
daisy
returned
from
the
bathroom
now
you
light
out
and
i
ll
make
a
respectable
toilette
my
how
i
did
sleep
i
was
worn
out
but
i
feel
fine
now
but
daisy
was
slow
to
take
the
hint
i
say
patsy
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
philip
called
patty
hesitated
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
decided
it
were
wiser
to
keep
her
own
counsel
regarding
that
matter
dreaming
i
s
pose
certainly
there
was
no
philip
here
in
but
you
said
distinctly
that
philip
called
daisy
persisted
well
s
pose
i
did
what
could
it
have
been
but
a
dream
do
you
imagine
i
had
a
real
live
caller
no
but
it
must
have
been
a
vivid
dream
it
was
said
patty
now
scoot
daisy
scooted
and
patty
locked
her
door
again
well
you
re
a
pretty
one
she
said
to
herself
the
idea
of
sleeping
all
night
without
going
to
bed
adele
will
be
terribly
exercised
over
it
but
i
have
other
things
to
worry
about
i
wonder
if
philip
will
really
come
up
here
and
if
he
does
what
bill
will
do
would
i
better
tell
bill
about
it
or
just
let
the
situation
develop
itself
oh
what
troubles
some
poor
little
pattys
do
have
come
in
this
last
in
response
to
a
gentle
tap
at
the
hall
door
a
trim
maid
entered
with
a
tray
oh
joy
cried
patty
i
m
simply
starving
is
it
sarah
ma
am
returned
the
girl
gazing
admiringly
at
pretty
patty
who
was
now
in
a
kimono
of
light
blue
silk
edged
with
well
sarah
stay
a
few
moments
and
you
can
help
me
dress
sit
down
sarah
obediently
took
the
small
chair
patty
designated
and
folded
her
hands
on
her
immaculate
frilled
apron
tell
me
about
the
hotel
sarah
said
patty
as
she
crunched
the
crisp
toast
between
her
white
teeth
and
smiled
at
the
maid
what
about
it
ma
am
well
let
me
see
how
did
you
maids
feel
when
you
found
the
guests
were
leaving
at
first
we
feared
we
d
lose
our
money
miss
then
we
were
told
that
our
contracts
held
till
the
end
of
this
month
and
if
we
would
stay
as
long
as
we
were
asked
to
we
d
get
paid
in
wasn
t
that
nice
fine
ma
am
i
m
using
mine
for
my
little
sister
s
schooling
and
i
d
sore
miss
so
all
the
servants
were
willing
to
stay
oh
yes
ma
am
you
see
none
could
get
good
places
up
here
the
hotels
all
have
their
own
and
many
of
them
will
close
the
first
of
i
see
isn
t
it
funny
to
have
a
dozen
guests
and
the
rest
of
this
big
place
empty
it
is
indeed
miss
shall
i
get
you
some
hotter
chocolate
no
i
ve
finished
thank
you
now
you
call
somebody
else
to
take
the
tray
and
you
stay
to
help
me
i
ve
taken
a
fancy
to
you
sarah
and
i
want
you
for
my
personal
maid
while
i
m
here
is
that
all
right
yes
indeed
miss
i
m
proud
to
do
for
you
but
i
m
not
a
trained
lady
s
never
mind
i
ll
train
patty
had
a
nice
way
with
servants
she
was
always
kind
and
treated
them
as
human
beings
yet
never
was
she
so
familiar
that
they
presumed
on
her
kindness
she
soon
discovered
that
sarah
though
untrained
was
deft
and
quick
to
learn
and
she
instructed
the
maid
in
the
duties
required
and
so
when
adele
came
tapping
at
the
door
she
found
patty
seated
before
the
mirror
while
sarah
was
coiling
the
golden
hair
according
to
directions
well
girlie
what
s
this
i
hear
about
your
sleeping
on
a
couch
when
a
perfectly
good
bed
was
all
turned
down
for
you
oh
just
one
of
my
whimsies
returned
patty
airily
don
t
bother
about
it
and
adele
was
wise
and
kind
enough
not
to
bother
soon
arrayed
in
a
most
becoming
white
serge
with
emerald
green
velvet
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
pale
green
silk
blouse
patty
descended
the
great
staircase
to
find
most
of
the
party
grouped
there
about
to
start
for
a
ramble
round
the
lake
course
i
ll
go
she
said
in
answer
to
eager
inquiries
my
hat
and
gloves
sarah
yes
miss
patty
and
the
maid
who
had
been
following
her
returned
upstairs
i
ve
adopted
sarah
as
my
personal
bodyguard
patty
said
you
don
t
mind
bill
do
you
not
a
bit
he
replied
heartily
the
house
is
yours
and
the
fulness
thereof
i
hope
all
of
you
ladies
who
want
maids
or
keepers
of
any
sort
will
call
on
the
service
force
for
sarah
came
down
then
bringing
patty
s
hat
a
soft
felt
green
and
turned
up
on
one
side
with
a
robin
hood
feather
it
was
most
becoming
as
patty
tilted
it
sideways
on
her
head
adjusting
it
before
a
large
mantel
mirror
now
we
re
off
she
said
gaily
but
we
ought
to
have
alpenstocks
or
here
are
some
said
bill
opening
a
cupboard
door
and
disclosing
a
lot
of
long
sticks
everybody
selected
one
and
they
set
forth
such
a
exclaimed
marie
as
at
every
fresh
turn
they
found
some
new
bit
of
scenery
or
different
view
i
could
stay
here
forever
me
too
agreed
mona
what
s
the
name
of
the
lake
something
like
skoodoowabskooskis
said
bill
laughing
but
for
short
everybody
calls
it
blue
rock
because
the
rocks
on
the
other
side
look
so
blue
i
suppose
suggested
daisy
i
believe
you
re
right
cried
chick
in
mock
amazement
at
her
quick
perception
whereupon
daisy
made
a
face
at
him
don
t
mind
him
daisy
said
patty
adding
teasingly
it
s
perfectly
true
the
distant
rocks
do
look
blue
hence
the
term
blue
rock
lake
rocks
and
the
lake
see
oh
you
smarty
and
daisy
lost
her
temper
a
little
for
she
hated
to
be
made
fun
of
if
you
tease
me
i
ll
tease
you
what
about
a
girl
who
wakes
up
babbling
of
some
philip
or
other
babbling
nothing
cried
patty
and
anyway
i
m
always
babbling
asleep
or
awake
oh
see
that
bird
what
a
beauty
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
no
bird
in
sight
but
canny
patty
knew
it
would
divert
attention
from
daisy
s
remark
and
it
did
after
vainly
looking
for
the
beautiful
bird
other
distractions
arose
and
patty
breathed
more
freely
that
nobody
had
noticed
daisy
s
fling
but
after
they
had
walked
all
round
the
lake
and
were
nearing
the
hotel
again
bill
stepped
to
patty
s
side
and
falling
in
step
with
her
put
his
strong
firm
hand
under
her
elbow
saying
want
some
help
little
girl
over
the
hard
places
channing
who
had
been
at
her
other
side
took
the
hint
and
fell
behind
with
some
of
the
others
what
s
this
about
your
waking
up
with
philip
s
name
on
your
lips
he
said
do
you
want
to
see
him
so
badly
if
so
i
ll
ask
him
up
here
patty
hesitated
here
was
her
chance
to
get
the
invitation
that
phil
so
coveted
and
yet
she
knew
bill
farnsworth
didn
t
want
him
nor
was
she
sure
that
she
wanted
him
herself
if
he
and
little
billee
weren
t
going
to
be
friendly
a
nice
time
she
would
have
if
the
two
men
were
cool
or
curt
to
each
other
so
she
said
no
i
don
t
want
him
especially
i
daresay
i
was
dreaming
of
him
i
dream
a
lot
anyway
of
everything
and
illustration
a
moment
patty
thought
then
she
said
no
thank
you
billie
i
don
dreaming
said
farnsworth
in
a
curious
voice
is
that
all
patty
all
what
do
you
mean
is
that
all
the
communication
you
had
with
van
reypen
last
night
in
dreams
patty
looked
up
startled
did
bill
know
of
the
telephone
message
would
he
care
patty
felt
a
certain
sense
of
guilt
though
as
she
told
herself
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
moreover
the
only
reason
she
had
for
not
telling
farnsworth
frankly
of
phil
s
message
was
merely
to
spare
him
annoyance
she
knew
he
would
be
annoyed
to
learn
that
phil
had
called
her
at
midnight
on
the
long
distance
and
if
he
didn
t
already
know
it
she
would
rather
he
shouldn
t
but
did
he
or
not
pray
how
else
could
i
talk
to
him
she
said
laughingly
do
you
suppose
i
am
a
medium
and
had
spirit
rappings
i
suppose
nothing
and
i
know
only
what
you
choose
to
tell
which
is
nothing
also
why
little
billee
you
re
in
a
mood
this
morning
aren
t
you
she
glanced
up
into
the
face
of
the
man
who
strode
beside
her
it
was
a
fine
face
strong
features
made
it
interesting
rather
than
handsome
it
was
also
a
determined
face
and
full
of
earnestness
of
purpose
but
in
the
blue
eyes
usually
lurked
a
glint
of
humour
for
the
moment
however
this
was
not
noticeable
and
farnsworth
s
lips
were
closed
rather
tightly
sure
sign
with
him
of
seriousness
since
you
choose
to
tell
me
nothing
i
accept
your
decision
but
once
more
i
ask
you
for
the
last
time
do
you
wish
me
to
invite
van
reypen
up
here
a
moment
patty
thought
then
she
said
no
thank
you
billee
i
don
farnsworth
s
brow
cleared
and
with
a
sunny
smile
down
at
her
he
said
then
the
incident
is
closed
forget
all
right
and
patty
smiled
back
well
pleased
that
she
had
decided
as
she
did
you
little
goose
said
he
i
know
perfectly
well
that
you
called
up
van
reypen
on
the
telephone
last
i
did
not
declared
patty
indignantly
now
apple
blossom
don
t
tell
naughty
stories
i
say
i
you
all
right
farnsworth
if
you
doubt
my
word
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
patty
was
thoroughly
angry
and
when
she
was
angry
she
looked
about
as
fierce
as
a
wrathy
kitten
but
also
when
patty
was
angry
a
few
foolish
tears
crowd
themselves
into
her
eyes
and
this
only
served
to
make
her
madder
yet
she
turned
from
him
wanting
to
leave
him
and
join
some
of
the
others
but
she
couldn
t
with
those
silly
drops
trembling
on
her
eyelashes
look
up
apple
blossom
said
a
gentle
voice
in
her
ear
farnsworth
s
voice
was
one
of
his
chief
charms
and
when
he
modulated
it
to
a
caressing
tone
it
would
cajole
the
birds
off
the
trees
patty
looked
up
and
something
in
her
blue
eyes
glistened
through
the
tears
that
somehow
made
her
look
incapable
of
telling
a
naughty
forgive
me
farnsworth
murmured
i
believe
you
whatever
you
tell
me
i
will
believe
you
whether
i
think
you
re
telling
the
truth
or
not
at
this
rather
ambiguous
statement
patty
looked
a
little
blank
but
before
she
could
ask
further
explanation
they
had
reached
the
hotel
and
they
all
went
in
chapter
v
m
lle
farini
according
to
farnsworth
s
plan
at
luncheon
each
girl
moved
her
seat
one
place
to
the
left
this
put
adele
at
the
host
s
left
and
moved
patty
on
farther
so
that
she
was
between
jim
kenerley
and
chick
channing
welcome
little
stranger
said
chick
as
they
sat
down
i
ll
have
you
now
and
again
tonight
at
dinner
sitting
by
me
side
and
then
life
will
be
a
dreary
blank
while
you
slowly
jog
all
round
the
table
getting
back
to
me
two
days
after
tomorrow
how
the
time
will
drag
you
re
so
flattering
and
patty
pretended
to
be
terribly
pleased
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
wishing
she
could
sit
next
little
billee
and
find
out
whether
he
was
really
angry
at
her
also
she
decided
she
would
tell
him
all
about
the
telephone
message
for
he
apparently
believed
she
had
told
him
a
falsehood
and
too
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
not
make
any
great
distinction
between
calling
and
being
called
on
the
telephone
what
do
you
think
about
it
shall
us
go
said
chick
and
patty
realised
with
a
start
that
she
had
been
so
lost
in
her
thoughts
that
she
hadn
t
heard
the
talk
at
table
go
where
she
asked
looking
blank
oh
come
back
from
dreamland
and
learn
what
s
going
on
cameron
knows
of
a
wonderful
hermit
who
lives
in
a
shack
in
the
woods
and
tells
fortunes
do
you
want
to
snatch
the
veil
from
the
hidden
future
and
learn
your
fate
yes
indeed
i
just
love
fortune
tellers
where
is
he
kit
off
in
the
woods
in
a
old
shanty
but
he
s
the
real
thing
in
seers
i
was
out
for
an
early
morning
prowl
and
i
discovered
him
bobbink
that
s
my
pet
bellhop
says
he
s
greatly
patronised
by
the
populace
but
though
he
gets
lots
of
coin
he
won
t
move
into
better
quarters
or
disport
himself
more
as
a
man
of
well
i
want
to
go
to
see
him
patty
declared

afternoon

sorry
but

another
so

i
said
daisy
looking
a
little
conscious
let
s
leave
fortune
teller
till
tomorrow
all
agreed
to
this
and
after
luncheon
was
over
they
proceeded
to
plan
various
sports
tennis
patty
asked
chick
no
too
and
patty
gave
a
restless
gesture
most
unusual
with
her
and
only
indulged
in
when
she
was
bothered
about
some
trifle
she
wanted
to
get
a
moment
alone
with
farnsworth
and
tell
him
about
phil
she
knew
from
the
way
little
billee
looked
at
her
or
rather
didn
t
look
at
her
that
he
was
hurt
or
offended
or
both
golf
then
chick
went
on
no
too
well
how
bout
lawn
bowls
what
are
they
never
tried
lawn
bowls
oh
they
re
lots
of
fun
come
in
a
short
time
they
had
collected
half
a
dozen
people
and
were
in
the
midst
of
a
gay
game
when
farnsworth
suddenly
appeared
riding
a
big
black
horse
very
stunning
he
looked
for
his
riding
togs
were
most
becoming
and
he
sat
his
horse
with
all
the
grace
and
easy
carelessness
of
the
western
rider
oh
billee
cried
patty
dropping
the
bowling
ball
she
was
about
to
roll
i
want
to
go
riding
and
then
she
was
covered
with
chagrin
for
daisy
came
out
of
the
hotel
also
garbed
in
the
trimmest
of
riding
costumes
and
a
groom
led
a
horse
for
her
to
mount
do
you
patty
said
bill
not
unkindly
but
with
a
disinterested
air
you
may
there
are
lots
of
horses
in
the
patty
quickly
recovered
her
poise
thank
you
she
cried
gaily
a
little
later
then
will
you
go
chick
will
i
just
try
me
well
we
ll
finish
this
game
and
then
there
will
be
time
the
game
over
they
went
for
a
ride
patty
s
riding
habit
was
dark
green
of
modish
cut
and
style
she
was
a
good
horsewoman
though
she
seldom
rode
channing
likewise
was
a
good
rider
but
he
made
no
such
picturesque
effect
in
the
saddle
as
big
bill
whither
away
he
said
as
they
started
is
it
too
far
to
go
over
to
poland
spring
house
not
a
bit
it
s
a
goodish
distance
but
the
road
is
splendid
and
it
isn
t
four
so
they
set
off
briskly
for
that
destination
the
exhilarating
air
and
exercise
quite
restored
patty
s
good
humour
and
she
cast
off
all
thought
of
petty
botherations
and
enjoyed
herself
thoroughly
great
she
exclaimed
smiling
at
chick
as
they
flew
along
yes
isn
t
it
and
it
s
not
so
very
far
we
re
nearing
the
approach
to
the
place
now
we
ll
have
time
for
tea
and
get
back
well
before
lovely
oh
what
a
big
hotel
and
you
look
at
the
squirrels
sure
enough
the
lawn
and
verandas
were
dotted
with
fat
gray
squirrels
they
were
very
tame
and
had
no
fear
of
people
or
horses
they
welcomed
patty
and
chick
by
sitting
up
and
blinking
at
them
as
they
dismounted
and
grooms
took
their
horses
away
asking
for
the
tea
room
they
were
shown
the
way
and
ushered
to
a
pleasant
table
chocolate
for
me
please
said
patty
as
the
waiter
stood
with
poised
pencil
i
hate
tea
so
chocolate
and
dear
little
fussy
chocolate
is
mine
too
then
whatsoever
thou
eatest
that
will
i
eat
also
well
by
jove
will
you
look
over
there
patty
looked
in
the
direction
that
chick
s
eyes
indicated
and
there
at
a
small
table
busily
eating
cakes
and
tea
sat
farnsworth
and
daisy
dow
shall
we
join
them
asked
chick
join
them
oh
no
they
don
t
want
joiners
they
re
absorbed
in
each
they
did
look
so
bill
was
earnestly
talking
and
daisy
was
listening
with
equal
intentness
her
face
was
bright
and
animated
while
farnsworth
s
was
serious
and
thoughtful
patty
was
angry
at
herself
for
being
one
whit
disturbed
at
sight
of
them
thus
chummily
having
their
tea
and
she
tossed
it
off
with
a
gay
laugh
besides
i
d
rather
chat
with
you
alone
than
to
have
a
good
girl
patty
and
chick
nodded
approvingly
do
you
know
i
think
you
re
about
as
nice
as
anybody
after
so
do
i
you
and
patty
sipped
her
chocolate
with
an
air
of
contentment
this
is
a
much
bigger
hotel
than
ours
isn
t
it
yes
but
ours
is
more
beautiful
i
think
and
quite
big
enough
for
our
of
course
oh
what
a
woman
see
chick
over
toward
your
channing
turned
slightly
to
see
a
very
handsome
woman
who
smiled
at
him
as
their
glances
met
why
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
if
it
isn
t
maudie
kent
i
say
patty
don
t
you
want
to
meet
her
she
s
an
actress
or
was
and
she
s
a
dear
awfully
good
form
and
all
that
and
really
worth
yes
i
d
love
to
know
her
said
patty
looking
with
interest
at
the
stunning
gown
the
lady
wore
it
was
of
silk
veiled
with
black
net
and
was
matched
by
a
wide
hat
of
black
with
plumes
excuse
me
a
moment
then
and
channing
rose
and
went
over
to
where
the
lady
stood
she
was
alone
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
come
to
their
table
you
dear
child
said
miss
kent
as
channing
introduced
them
how
pretty
you
are
i
m
so
glad
to
know
you
but
what
are
you
doing
here
with
chick
channing
just
having
tea
said
patty
smiling
back
into
the
big
dark
eyes
that
looked
at
her
so
kindly
but
are
you
staying
here
where
are
your
people
we
are
staying
over
at
freedom
hall
she
began
and
then
paused
for
with
those
eyes
upon
her
she
couldn
t
quite
make
it
seem
a
rational
thing
to
do
oh
it
s
quite
all
right
maudie
channing
put
in
there
s
a
crowd
of
us
with
chaperons
and
things
and
our
good
host
by
the
way
is
right
across
the
room
at
a
that
chap
with
the
pretty
girl
oh
it
s
farnsworth
mayn
t
i
know
her
too
now
see
here
maudie
you
can
t
know
everybody
that
i
do
be
content
with
miss
fairfield
at
least
for
the
oh
i
am
more
than
content
no
i
ll
have
coffee
please
chocolate
is
only
for
the
very
surely
you
are
that
ventured
patty
glancing
at
the
graceful
form
of
the
new
acquaintance
but
i
wouldn
t
be
if
i
indulged
in
sweet
things
enjoy
them
while
you
may
my
dear
in
after
years
you
ll
be
glad
you
what
are
you
doing
here
maudie
asked
channing
are
you
alone
yes
i
m
having
a
concert
tonight
and
i
m
in
such
trouble
you
see
she
turned
to
patty
i
m
a
sort
of
professional
entertainer
i
give
concerts
or
recitals
and
i
get
performers
of
the
very
best
and
usually
they
are
most
dependable
and
reliable
but
tonight
i
have
a
concert
scheduled
and
my
prima
donna
is
lacking
if
she
doesn
t
come
on
this
next
train
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
do
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
give
back
the
ticket
money
and
call
the
affair
off
and
that
means
a
great
loss
to
me
for
i
have
to
pay
the
other
performers
their
price
just
the
that
s
a
shame
said
channing
sympathetically
but
she
ll
surely
i
m
afraid
not
i
ve
telegraphed
and
i
can
t
get
her
anywhere
i
can
t
help
thinking
she
deliberately
threw
me
down
because
she
received
a
better
offer
or
something
of
the
sort
but
i
mustn
t
bore
you
with
my
troubles
forget
it
miss
fairfield
and
don
t
look
so
i
m
so
sorry
for
you
said
patty
to
go
to
all
that
trouble
and
expense
and
have
it
all
for
less
than
nothing
said
chick
for
you
stand
to
lose
considerable
i
yes
well
over
five
hundred
dollars
oh
here
are
the
motorbuses
from
the
train
now
we
ll
but
though
many
guests
arrived
at
the
hotel
the
singer
was
not
amongst
them
no
said
miss
kent
scanning
them
sadly
she
isn
t
here
oh
what
shall
i
do
patty
s
mind
was
working
fast
she
knit
her
brows
as
she
tried
to
think
calmly
of
a
wild
project
that
had
come
into
her
mind
miss
kent
she
began
and
stopped
i
well
my
dear
what
is
it
do
you
want
to
ask
something
of
me
don
t
hesitate
i
m
not
very
terrifying
am
i
chick
no
indeed
what
is
it
patty
oh
of
course
it
wouldn
t
do
hate
to
suggest
it
even
you
see
miss
kent
i
can
and
patty
can
impersonate
the
absent
singer
and
nobody
would
ever
know
the
difference
great
cried
channing
oh
maudie
your
trouble
is
at
an
end
now
wait
said
patty
blushing
i
am
not
a
professional
singer
but
i
have
studied
with
good
masters
and
i
have
a
voice
not
so
very
big
but
true
forgive
this
plain
speaking
but
if
i
could
help
you
out
miss
kent
i
should
be
so
you
re
a
little
darling
exclaimed
maud
kent
i
wonder
if
we
carry
off
such
a
thing
you
see
your
coming
here
as
you
just
did
a
stranger
and
talking
to
me
only
looks
quite
as
if
you
were
the
arriving
singer
that
part
s
all
right
as
to
your
voice
i
have
no
doubts
about
that
for
you
say
you
sang
a
and
any
way
even
a
fair
singer
would
do
in
addition
to
the
talent
i
have
but
miss
fairfield
i
can
t
accept
this
from
you
will
you
take
just
the
price
i
expected
to
give
m
lle
farini
i
couldn
t
accept
money
miss
kent
that
would
be
impossible
i
m
glad
to
do
this
to
help
you
out
for
it
s
no
trouble
for
me
to
sing
i
love
to
do
it
and
don
t
bother
about
the
payment
give
it
to
some
charity
if
you
oh
i
can
t
accept
your
services
without
pay
but
if
you
knew
what
a
temptation
it
is
yield
to
it
then
and
patty
smiled
at
the
troubled
face
but
first
you
must
hear
my
voice
you
can
t
decide
before
that
where
can
we
go
come
up
to
my
apartment
no
one
will
hear
us
there
and
if
they
should
it
s
no
great
harm
one
may
practise
i
suppose
you
may
come
too
chick
if
you
the
three
left
the
and
as
they
disappeared
through
the
door
farnsworth
caught
sight
of
patty
s
face
what
does
that
mean
he
cried
so
angrily
that
daisy
was
startled
what
does
what
mean
did
you
see
who
went
out
that
door
no
who
patty
and
chick
channing
and
maudie
i
know
the
first
two
but
who
is
maudie
kent
an
actress
a
woman
channing
and
i
knew
in
san
francisco
a
good
while
ago
what
can
she
be
doing
here
and
how
did
she
get
hold
of
patty
though
of
course
chick
is
responsible
for
that
but
what
are
they
up
to
i
m
going
after
bill
don
t
do
anything
so
foolish
patty
has
a
right
to
visit
the
lady
if
she
wants
to
it
isn
t
your
but
that
woman
why
isn
t
she
a
nice
woman
she
s
an
actress
i
tell
well
lots
of
actresses
are
lovely
ladies
isn
t
this
one
yes
of
course
she
s
a
lovely
lady
but
patty
oughtn
t
to
be
racing
round
with
patty
wasn
t
racing
she
wouldn
t
do
such
a
thing
in
poland
spring
house
now
bill
put
it
out
of
your
mind
there
s
no
occasion
for
you
to
get
stirred
up
because
patty
has
made
a
new
acquaintance
and
i
guess
chick
channing
can
take
care
of
her
he
wouldn
t
let
her
know
anybody
who
wasn
t
all
chick
is
thoughtless
he
likes
maudie
and
so
do
i
but
she
s
no
fit
companion
for
why
is
patty
fairfield
better
than
us
common
people
is
she
made
of
finer
clay
wouldn
t
you
want
to
meet
the
maudie
lady
oh
you
why
that
wouldn
t
matter
so
bill
farnsworth
what
a
speech
i
guess
i
m
every
bit
as
good
as
patty
of
course
you
are
daisy
don
t
be
silly
but
you
re
experienced
you
know
and
a
little
conventional
patty
has
never
had
half
the
experience
of
the
world
that
you
have
i
don
t
want
her
mixed
up
with
that
sort
of
people
and
i
won
t
have
it
well
and
daisy
spoke
coldly
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
help
it
they
ve
gone
off
and
you
can
t
very
well
follow
them
or
have
them
arrested
probably
chick
and
patty
are
starting
for
home
and
i
m
sure
it
s
time
we
but
i
can
t
go
off
and
leave
patty
here
you
can
t
do
anything
else
you
re
not
patty
s
keeper
bill
and
it
s
silly
to
act
as
if
you
that
s
so
farnsworth
s
fine
face
looked
anxious
and
his
eyes
were
sad
come
on
i
suppose
we
had
better
be
going
i
ll
order
the
horses
farnsworth
kept
a
sharp
eye
out
but
he
saw
no
more
of
the
trio
who
had
left
the
tea
room
and
who
had
so
disturbed
him
in
quiet
mood
he
rode
off
at
daisy
s
side
and
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
chapter
vi
maude
s
confidences
meantime
patty
in
miss
kent
s
parlour
was
singing
her
best
the
scheme
appealed
to
her
very
strongly
she
was
glad
to
assist
the
kind
and
beautiful
lady
and
moreover
she
enjoyed
an
escapade
of
any
sort
and
this
surely
was
one
miss
kent
was
delighted
with
her
voice
and
predicted
an
ovation
for
her
they
selected
several
of
patty
s
best
songs
and
had
the
accompanist
in
to
rehearse
with
her
what
about
dress
said
patty
after
it
was
positively
settled
that
she
was
to
sing
at
the
concert
i
ll
ride
over
and
get
you
whatever
you
want
said
channing
anxious
to
be
of
service
oh
no
said
miss
kent
that
would
be
a
shame
for
you
to
go
to
all
that
trouble
i
have
a
little
white
tulle
gown
that
can
be
made
just
right
in
a
jiffy
i
am
a
bit
taller
than
miss
fairfield
but
a
tuck
will
fix
that
now
here
s
an
important
point
you
see
the
notices
and
the
programmes
all
say
m
lle
farini
will
sing
shall
we
let
it
go
at
that
i
mean
let
miss
fairfield
impersonate
m
lle
farini
or
shall
we
have
an
announcement
made
at
the
opening
of
the
concert
that
miss
fairfield
is
acting
as
substitute
i
d
rather
let
it
go
without
the
use
of
my
name
said
patty
i
don
t
know
as
it
would
be
quite
right
but
i
d
love
to
let
people
think
i
was
the
farini
lady
it
would
be
such
well
said
miss
kent
let
s
just
leave
it
if
we
don
t
say
anything
of
course
the
audience
will
take
it
for
granted
that
you
are
m
lle
farini
and
if
any
objections
are
raised
or
if
it
comes
out
afterward
i
can
say
that
i
had
to
substitute
you
at
the
last
moment
and
there
was
no
time
to
have
new
programmes
that
will
be
fine
patty
declared
i
do
love
a
joke
and
this
is
really
a
good
one
i
think
yes
let
me
be
m
lle
farini
for
one
night
only
and
if
the
real
owner
of
that
name
objects
why
it
will
be
all
over
then
and
she
ll
have
to
take
it
out
in
objecting
but
i
shan
t
disgrace
her
even
if
i
don
t
sing
as
well
as
she
but
you
do
miss
fairfield
exclaimed
miss
kent
she
has
a
fuller
stronger
voice
but
yours
has
more
melody
and
sweetness
you
will
remain
here
over
night
of
oh
i
never
thought
about
that
and
patty
looked
a
little
alarmed
i
don
t
know
what
adele
will
oh
please
do
you
really
must
i
have
two
bedrooms
in
my
suite
and
i
can
make
you
very
well
and
patty
hesitated
i
ll
have
to
talk
this
thing
over
with
kenerley
i
ll
telephone
her
now
and
if
she
is
willing
i
will
stay
here
all
so
patty
called
up
adele
and
told
her
the
whole
story
adele
listened
and
then
she
laughed
and
told
patty
she
could
do
as
she
liked
i
think
it
s
a
performance
she
said
but
jim
says
go
ahead
if
you
want
to
you
stay
with
your
new
friend
all
night
of
course
you
couldn
t
come
home
after
the
concert
i
suppose
channing
will
stay
at
that
hotel
too
and
then
he
can
bring
you
home
in
the
morning
what
will
you
wear
patty
told
her
and
then
she
asked
adele
not
to
tell
the
others
what
she
was
up
to
i
m
afraid
they
ll
come
over
she
said
and
i
can
carry
it
through
all
right
before
strangers
but
if
all
you
people
sat
up
in
front
of
me
giggling
i
couldn
t
keep
my
face
straight
i
know
so
don
t
tell
them
till
after
it
s
all
right
girlie
i
will
keep
your
fateful
secret
locked
in
my
heart
till
you
bid
me
speak
have
a
good
time
and
sing
your
now
that
s
all
right
and
patty
looked
enchanted
at
the
prospect
of
fun
ahead
i
m
going
to
have
the
time
of
my
life
you
go
away
now
chick
and
miss
kent
and
i
will
see
about
my
frock
shall
we
meet
at
dinner
yes
i
want
you
two
girls
to
dine
with
me
do
you
know
anybody
maudie
to
make
a
fourth
no
wait
chick
i
don
t
want
to
dine
in
public
nor
do
i
want
miss
fairfield
to
be
bothered
with
a
company
dinner
i
ll
tell
you
a
better
plan
she
and
i
will
dine
alone
here
in
my
little
parlour
you
get
your
dinner
downstairs
by
yourself
and
then
after
the
concert
is
over
you
can
invite
us
to
supper
and
we
can
talk
it
channing
acquiesced
and
then
he
went
away
not
to
see
them
again
until
supper
time
you
are
so
good
miss
oh
do
call
me
patty
i
like
it
so
much
i
ll
be
glad
to
and
you
must
call
me
maude
it
is
a
perfect
godsend
your
helping
me
out
like
this
may
i
tell
you
just
a
little
bit
about
myself
i
wish
you
would
and
i
m
so
glad
i
can
be
of
service
to
but
first
they
must
needs
attend
to
the
matter
of
patty
s
frock
and
sure
enough
a
white
tulle
of
maude
s
was
easily
and
quickly
altered
till
it
just
fitted
patty
it
was
new
and
modish
made
with
full
skirts
and
tiers
of
narrow
frills
there
was
no
lace
or
other
trimming
save
the
soft
tulle
ruffles
and
maude
decreed
no
jewelry
of
any
sort
merely
a
few
yellow
roses
at
the
belt
tiny
mignon
roses
these
she
ordered
from
the
office
and
by
that
time
their
dinner
was
served
as
they
sat
enjoying
the
few
but
dishes
that
maude
had
selected
she
told
patty
somewhat
of
her
life
and
patty
listened
with
interest
i
have
to
support
myself
my
mother
and
a
crippled
sister
maude
said
and
i
had
ambition
to
become
a
great
actress
but
after
a
fair
trial
i
found
i
could
be
at
best
only
a
mediocre
actress
i
found
however
that
i
had
talent
for
organizing
and
arranging
entertainments
and
i
concluded
i
could
make
more
money
that
way
than
on
the
stage
so
i
took
it
up
as
a
regular
business
and
i
have
succeeded
but
this
year
has
not
been
a
very
good
one
i
ve
had
some
misfortunes
and
twice
i
didn
t
get
the
money
due
me
because
of
dishonest
assistants
and
i
tell
you
truly
patty
if
i
had
lost
five
or
six
hundred
dollars
tonight
it
would
have
been
a
hard
blow
you
have
saved
me
from
that
and
i
bless
and
thank
you
do
you
realize
little
girl
what
you
are
doing
for
me
i
m
so
glad
i
can
tell
me
about
your
clare
oh
she
is
the
dearest
thing
she
never
has
walked
but
in
spite
of
her
affliction
she
is
the
happiest
cheeriest
sweetest
nature
you
ever
saw
i
love
her
so
and
i
love
to
be
able
to
get
little
delicacies
and
comforts
for
her
see
here
is
her
patty
took
the
case
and
saw
the
portrait
of
a
girl
little
more
than
a
child
she
is
a
dear
maude
i
don
t
wonder
you
love
her
oh
i
m
so
glad
i
happened
over
here
today
do
you
know
bill
farnsworth
i
met
him
once
or
twice
the
same
winter
i
met
chick
channing
farnsworth
seemed
very
stiff
and
sedate
chick
is
much
more
chick
is
gayer
but
bill
is
an
awfully
nice
i
was
with
a
vaudeville
troupe
that
year
it
wasn
t
very
nice
work
and
small
pay
it
was
my
last
attempt
on
the
stage
if
i
couldn
t
be
a
big
and
fine
actress
i
didn
t
want
to
be
any
at
all
so
i
m
glad
i
gave
it
up
for
this
sort
of
work
this
season
is
about
over
now
and
i
shall
have
entertainments
in
new
york
this
winter
i
ve
lots
of
influential
patrons
and
i
hope
for
success
but
i
shall
never
forget
your
heavenly
kindness
in
helping
me
out
tonight
now
perhaps
we
had
better
be
getting
patty
made
a
careful
toilette
for
she
wanted
to
look
her
best
and
she
succeeded
the
soft
dainty
white
tulle
was
exceedingly
becoming
and
she
had
done
her
hair
the
prettiest
way
she
knew
maude
s
slippers
were
the
least
bit
loose
but
they
looked
all
right
and
patty
refused
a
loan
of
a
pair
of
long
white
gloves
they
re
not
wearing
them
with
evening
gowns
this
season
she
said
and
i
hate
them
you
re
right
and
maude
surveyed
her
critically
your
arms
are
lovely
soft
and
dimpled
you
are
more
effective
without
through
the
opening
numbers
of
the
concert
patty
sat
in
the
waiting
her
turn
she
was
not
nervous
or
apprehensive
and
when
the
time
came
she
walked
out
on
the
platform
and
bowed
gracefully
with
a
cordial
little
smile
she
was
to
sing
almost
exactly
the
selections
of
m
lle
farini
but
she
had
substituted
others
in
one
or
two
instances
and
of
course
for
encores
she
could
make
her
own
choice
and
there
were
plenty
of
encores
patty
s
sweet
voice
charmed
by
its
sympathy
and
grace
rather
than
by
volume
and
it
made
a
very
decided
hit
with
the
audience
they
applauded
continuously
until
patty
was
forced
to
respond
a
second
and
a
third
time
after
each
of
her
numbers
channing
sitting
in
the
audience
heard
people
saying
who
is
this
farini
i
never
heard
of
her
before
her
voice
is
a
little
wonder
miss
kent
was
delighted
with
patty
s
success
she
had
felt
sure
the
hearers
would
like
patty
s
music
but
she
did
not
expect
such
unanimous
approval
nor
such
enthusiasm
four
times
patty
was
announced
to
sing
and
as
each
was
encored
at
least
once
it
made
a
good
many
songs
at
the
last
appearance
she
was
very
tired
but
she
bravely
endeavoured
not
to
show
it
she
went
through
the
number
beautifully
but
the
deafening
applause
made
it
impossible
for
her
not
to
give
them
one
more
i
can
t
said
patty
as
maude
came
to
her
with
entreaties
i
m
all
in
as
the
boys
say
oh
well
i
ll
sing
one
more
little
thing
no
accompaniment
at
all
please
then
patty
returned
to
the
platform
and
when
the
enthusiastic
welcome
ceased
she
sang
very
softly
a
little
cradle
song
the
haunting
sweetness
of
the
notes
and
the
delicate
languor
of
patty
s
tired
voice
made
an
exquisite
combination
more
effective
even
than
her
other
work
she
finished
in
a
pure
fine
minor
strain
and
with
a
little
tired
bow
walked
slowly
from
the
stage
then
the
house
went
wild
they
clapped
and
shouted
brava
and
demanded
more
but
the
concert
was
over
miss
kent
made
a
little
speech
of
thanks
and
the
footlights
went
out
reluctantly
the
people
rose
from
their
seats
but
hung
around
hoping
to
get
a
glimpse
of
m
lle
farini
illustration
patty
s
sweet
voice
charmed
by
its
sympathy
it
isn
t
so
much
her
voice
chick
overheard
somebody
say
as
the
way
she
has
with
her
she
s
charming
that
s
what
she
is
charming
we
can
t
have
supper
in
the
maude
said
laughingly
to
channing
patty
would
be
mobbed
those
people
are
just
lying
in
wait
for
but
i
want
to
cried
patty
i
ve
done
the
work
now
i
want
the
fun
let
s
have
supper
there
they
won
t
really
come
up
and
speak
to
me
when
they
don
t
know
won
t
they
said
maude
but
indeed
you
shall
have
supper
wherever
you
like
you
deserve
anything
you
want
come
on
chick
it
s
to
be
just
as
patty
so
to
the
they
went
and
there
patty
became
the
observed
of
all
at
first
she
didn
t
mind
and
then
it
became
most
embarrassing
she
could
hear
her
name
mentioned
on
all
sides
and
though
it
was
always
coupled
with
compliments
it
made
her
uncomfortable
to
be
so
conspicuous
though
of
course
she
said
gaily
they
re
not
talking
about
me
but
about
m
lle
farini
well
i
m
pretty
hungry
chick
maude
made
me
eat
a
light
dinner
as
i
was
going
to
sing
now
i
want
to
make
up
can
i
have
some
bouillon
and
some
chicken
king
and
some
salad
and
some
ice
cream
well
well
what
a
little
gourmande
why
you
d
have
nightmare
after
all
that
no
i
wouldn
t
i
m
fearfully
hungry
honest
i
so
patty
had
her
selection
and
though
she
ate
little
of
each
course
she
took
small
portions
with
decided
relish
i
feel
like
a
new
lady
she
declared
when
she
had
finished
is
there
dancing
can
i
have
a
turn
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
bed
of
course
you
can
dance
said
maude
but
you
must
remain
m
lle
farini
for
the
evening
can
you
remember
course
i
can
it
ll
be
fun
besides
i
m
only
going
to
have
one
trot
with
chick
and
then
i
ll
go
like
a
good
little
but
as
might
have
been
expected
after
her
one
dance
patty
was
besieged
by
partners
clamouring
for
an
introduction
the
manager
of
the
hotel
was
bribed
cajoled
and
threatened
in
the
various
efforts
of
his
guests
to
get
introductions
to
patty
and
to
miss
kent
just
one
or
two
patty
whispered
to
maude
and
so
two
or
three
young
men
won
the
coveted
presentation
and
patty
was
urged
to
dance
but
this
she
refused
she
wanted
to
chat
a
little
with
these
strangers
but
she
didn
t
care
to
dance
with
men
so
lately
made
acquainted
channing
acted
as
bodyguard
and
his
close
inspection
would
have
barred
out
any
one
he
did
not
altogether
approve
of
but
they
were
a
nice
class
of
men
polite
and
and
they
were
entertaining
as
well
patty
had
a
right
down
good
time
and
not
the
least
part
of
the
fun
was
the
masquerading
as
another
you
are
staying
here
long
m
lle
farini
asked
gaunt
an
attractive
man
of
musical
tastes
no
patty
replied
i
have
to
leave
early
in
the
morning
i
m
due
to
sing
at
another
hotel
tomorrow
ah
a
house
not
very
do
you
sing
gaunt
yes
baritone
i
d
like
to
sing
with
you
i
ve
an
idea
our
voices
would
i
m
sure
they
would
i
love
to
sing
duets
but
and
pretty
patty
looked
regretful
it
can
not
be
we
will
never
meet
how
can
you
be
so
sure
i
feel
it
but
tomorrow
i
m
going
to
have
my
fortune
told
if
the
seer
says
anything
about
our
future
meeting
then
i
ll
look
for
you
later
if
the
seer
is
a
true
soothsayer
and
no
fake
he
can
t
help
telling
you
we
will
meet
again
because
it
is
a
foregone
then
i
shall
expect
you
and
look
forward
to
the
meeting
and
patty
held
out
her
hand
to
say
for
it
was
after
midnight
and
maude
was
making
signs
for
her
to
come
with
her
but
just
then
a
clerk
came
toward
them
with
a
puzzled
face
there
s
a
telephone
call
for
a
miss
fairfield
he
said
and
the
speaker
says
she
s
here
with
channing

said
chick
it
s
all
right
m
lle
farini
has
occasion
to
use
different
names
in
her
profession
which
booth
this
way
channing
beckoning
to
patty
followed
the
man
and
whispered
to
her
to
take
the
message
as
it
must
be
from
some
of
the
freedom
castle
people
patty
went
into
the
booth
and
to
her
surprise
was
greeted
by
philip
van
reypen
well
she
exclaimed
a
little
annoyed

and
patty
hung
up
the
receiver
chapter
vii
the
fortune
teller
next
morning
patty
and
maude
had
a
cosy
little
breakfast
in
the
latter
s
apartment
and
then
arrayed
in
her
riding
habit
patty
went
down
to
find
channing
waiting
for
her
on
the
veranda
good
morning
m
lle
farini
he
said
gaily
ready

will
promised
channing
and
then
the
two
cantered
away
here
they
come
cried
daisy
as
from
the
porch
of
freedom
castle
she
spied
the
two
equestrians
jim
kenerley
was
at
the
block
to
help
patty
alight
and
as
she
ran
up
the
steps
adele
clasped
her
in
a
welcoming
embrace
you
dear
child
she
said
what
an
experience
you
have
had
sit
down
here
and
tell
us
all
about
so
patty
told
the
whole
story
exactly
as
it
had
happened
and
channing
added
details
here
and
there
everybody
was
interested
and
asked
all
sorts
of
questions
is
it
a
nice
hotel
asked
mona
did
you
have
any
fun
after
the
concert
there
was
dancing
said
patty
but
i
was
too
scared
when
people
called
me
m
lle
farini
to
enjoy
it
much
i
wanted
to
get
away
i
m
glad
i
did
it
for
miss
kent
again
if
she
s
the
maude
kent
i
once
knew
you
had
no
business
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
put
in
farnsworth
in
a
gruff
voice
she
s
the
miss
kent
chick
channing
knows
and
that
s
enough
for
me
retorted
patty
and
a
little
pink
spot
showed
in
either
cheek
a
sure
sign
that
she
was
annoyed
well
shall
we
go
to
the
hermit
s
said
elise
anxious
to
avert
the
impending
scene
what
you
think
patty
kit
has
a
toothache
and
can
t
go
after
toothache
yes
a
bad
ulceration
he
sent
down
word
by
bobbink
that
pet
bellboy
of
his
that
we
were
to
go
on
without
him
the
boy
will
show
us
the
how
ridiculous
why
not
wait
till
tomorrow
no
kit
says
the
hermit
man
expects
us
and
we
must
go
you
ll
go
along
won
t
you
yes
of
course
shall
i
change
this
rigging
go
as
i
am
go
as
you
are
it
s
time
we
were
off
roger
and
mona
have
gone
on
ahead
but
as
they
went
in
the
opposite
direction
i
am
not
sure
they
ll
get
there
before
we
those
two
have
a
fancy
for
going
in
the
opposite
direction
laughed
patty
ever
notice
it
not
being
stone
blind
i
have
elise
admitted
and
really
the
interest
roger
and
mona
had
for
each
other
became
more
apparent
each
day
the
kenerleys
declined
to
go
on
the
hermit
expedition
saying
that
they
knew
their
fortune
and
had
no
reason
for
questioning
the
future
so
the
others
started
channing
took
possession
of
patty
and
merely
saying
which
way
he
led
her
across
the
wide
lawn
to
the
indicated
path
through
the
wood
elise
followed
with
bob
peyton
who
greatly
admired
the
pretty
new
york
girl
farnsworth
and
daisy
dow
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
and
bobbink
the
ever
useful
courier
showed
the
way
mr
cameron
says
for
you
to
do
jes
wot
i
says
he
announced
evidently
greatly
pleased
at
his
position
of
power
go
ahead
bobbink
said
bill
show
us
the
way
but
don
t
talk
too
yassir
dis
way
ladies
an
it
was
a
beautiful
walk
through
the
autumn
sunshine
and
forest
shade
now
they
crossed
a
tiny
brook
or
paused
to
admire
a
misty
waterfall
and
again
they
found
a
long
stretch
of
good
state
road
and
sooner
than
any
one
expected
they
reached
the
shack
dat
s
de
place
announced
bobbink
and
stood
pointing
to
the
dilapidated
shanty
at
the
side
of
the
road
who
ll
go
in
first
asked
patty
i
m
i
m
not
and
daisy
stepped
nearer
and
peered
curiously
in
at
the
door
come
in
woman
said
a
strange
cracked
old
voice
and
there
followed
a
laugh
like
a
cackle
come
in
each
and
daisy
pushed
in
and
farnsworth
stepped
in
too
for
he
didn
t
altogether
like
the
sound
of
that
laugh
then
they
all
crowded
in
and
saw
the
old
hermit
sitting
in
a
position
on
a
pile
of
rugs
in
the
corner
of
the
hut
which
one
first
he
muttered
which
pretty
lady
first
all
have
fortunes
wonderful
fortunes
coming
to
the
old
man
s
garb
was
somewhat
like
that
of
a
monk
a
dingy
robe
was
girdled
with
a
hempen
rope
and
a
hood
fell
well
over
his
brow
his
face
was
brown
and
seamed
and
wrinkled
with
age
and
he
wore
dark
glasses
on
his
hands
were
old
gloves
that
had
once
been
white
but
were
now
a
dingy
grey
and
he
seemed
feeble
and
unable
to
move
without
difficulty
but
he
was
alert
doubtless
spurred
by
the
hope
of
getting
well
paid
you
go
first
daisy
said
patty
then
we
ll
see
how
it
all
right
i
m
not
afraid
and
daisy
extended
her
palm
to
the
old
man
here
wait
she
cried
don
t
touch
me
with
those
dirty
old
gloves
can
t
i
wrap
my
handkerchief
round
my
hand
the
hermit
made
no
objection
and
daisy
wound
a
fresh
handkerchief
about
her
fingers
leaving
the
palm
exposed
for
the
seer
to
read
he
began
in
a
droning
voice
pretty
lady
your
home
is
far
away
you
are
not
of
this
end
of
the
country
but
off
toward
the
setting
sun

will
return
there
soon
and
there
you
will
meet
your
fate
he
awaits
you
there
a
man
of
brain
and
brawn
a
man
who
has
ambition
to
become
the
mayor
hush
cried
daisy
snatching
her
hand
away
from
his
gloved
fingers

t
you
say
another
word
that
s
a
secret
i
don
t
want
any
more
fortune
that
man
s
a
wizard
daisy
moved
across
the
room
putting
all
the
distance
possible
between
her
and
the
seer
with
startled
eyes
she
gazed
at
him
as
at
a
world
wonder
pooh
that
was
a
chance
shot
daisy
said
elise

me
try

elise
blushing
a
little
as
she
withdrew
her
hand

hate

patty
a
little
reluctantly
surrendered
her
hand
to
the
seer
who
took
it
lightly
in
his
own
pretty
lady
all
upset
he
began
so
many
suitors
all

patty
laughed
merrily
i
ve
been
waiting
for
the
dark
lady
and
the
gentleman
who
always
figure
in
fortunes
well
what
about
the
dark
lady
if
the
pretty
miss
makes
the
fun
there
is
no
more
fortune

said
the
hermit
sulkily
i
don
t
mind
so
long
as
you
don
t
take
the
money
tell
mine
then
said
channing
as
patty
resigned
her
place
you
sir
are
an
acrobat
you
were
employed
in
the
big
circus
the
when
they
discharged
you
it
was
but
temporary
do
not
fear
you
will
regain
your
position
why
you
old
wiz
how
did
you
know
that
and
channing
stared
in
pretended
amazement
i
thought
that
episode
in
my
career
was
a
dead
secret
no
episodes
are
secrets
to
me
declared
the
hermit
shall
i
tell
further
no
i
guess
that
will
be
about
all
and
channing
moved
quickly
away
from
the
strange
old
man
bob
peyton
declined
to
have
his
past
exposed
to
the
public
gaze
and
he
said
he
didn
t
care
to
know
what
the
future
held
for
him
he
d
far
rather
be
surprised
at
his
life
as
it
happened
so
bill
farnsworth
was
the
next
to
test
the
wizard
s
powers
big
man
said
the
hermit
solemnly
as
he
scanned
the
broad
palm
bill
offered
for
inspection
big
man

way

said
farnsworth
for

dinner
today

that
and
i
ll
believe
in
your
big
man

pleased
to
be
sarcastic
the
hermit
does
not

his
occult
powers
on
foolish
questions
in
a
few
hours
you
will
know
what
you
will
have
for
dinner

let
me
tell
you
what
you

friends
behold
mr
kit
cameron
with
a
swift
movement
farnsworth
drew
off
the
old
gloves
from
the
hand
that
held
his
and
exposed
the
unmistakable
slim
white
hands
of
the
musician
kit
oh
you
fraud
cried
patty
i
half
suspected
it
all
the
time
i
didn
t
exclaimed
daisy
you
fooled
me
completely
oh
my
fortune
wailed
elise
where
are
those
two
lovely
fates
of
mine
and
all
my
money
groaned
patty
i
feel
as
if
you
had
misappropriated
my
funds
it
had
not
been
necessary
further
to
remove
cameron
s
disguise
it
was
enough
to
see
his
hands
and
hear
his
merry
laugh
hist
cried
peyton
who
had
looked
out
along
the
road
here
come
roger
and
mona
let
s
give
them
a
song
and
kit
drew
on
his
old
gloves
again
and
huddled
into
his
crouched
posture
just
as
the
two
came
in
at
the
hut
s
door
just
in
time
said
channing
we
ve
all
had
our
fortunes
told
and
were
just
about
to
go
home
take
your
turn
i
don
t
like
to
said
mona
who
was
looking
very
happy
and
was
blushing
a
little
kit
spied
this
pretty
lady
he
began
in
his
droning
tones
and
as
he
also
had
a
slight
knowledge
of
ventriloquism
he
most
effectually
disguised
his
own
voice
give
me
your
little
go
on
mona
we
all
did
said
patty
and
wonderingly
mona
held
out
her
hand
never
saw
i
the
future
so
plainly
revealed
declared
the
seer
tis
written
as
in
letters
of
fire
lady
thy
fate
is
sealed
it
is
bound
up
with
that
of
a
true
and
noble
knight
a
loving
soul
a
faithful
comrade
i
see
the
blush
that
mantles
your
rosy
cheek
i
see
the
trembling
of
your
lily
hand
i
see
the
drooped
eyelashes
that
veil
your
dancing
eyes
and
i
see
stretching
far
into
the
future
years
of
happiness
and
kit
released
mona
s
hand
and
the
girls
crowded
round
her
what
does
he
mean
daisy
cried
he
spoke
so
in
stay
and
the
seer
raised
his
hand
now
will
i
tell
the
fortune
of
the
noble
gentleman
who
but
now
arrived
your
hand
fair
rubbish
said
roger
disinclined
for
the
performance
go
on
farry
said
farnsworth
smiling
we
all
did
go
roger
gave
over
his
hand
and
the
hermit
rocked
back
and
forth
in
glee
another
clear
writing
of
the
fates
he
exclaimed
i
read
of
a
happy
future
with
the
loved
one
i
read
that
only
just
now
within
the
hour
has
the
fair
said
yes
to
repeated
pleadings
and
the
betrothal
took
place
oh
i
say
and
roger
tried
to
pull
his
hand
from
the
hermit
s
grasp
tis
a
fair
tale
i
read
went
on
the
wizard
holding
fast
the
hand
he
read
two
young
hearts
made
for
each
other
plighted
by
the
singing
the
balmy
a
bower
of
roses
by
bendemeer
s
hang
it
old
chap
let
me
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
kit
flung
off
his
cowl
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
gripped
roger
s
in
a
grasp
and
shook
it
heartily
then
there
was
a
pandemonium
the
girls
fell
on
mona
kissing
her
and
asking
questions
while
the
men
joined
hands
in
a
sort
of
war
dance
round
roger
then
they
all
made
a
circle
round
the
engaged
pair
and
sang
oats
peas
beans
and
barley
grows
with
the
zest
of
a
crowd
of
children
perfectly
gorgeous
i
think
cried
patty
as
the
excitement
calmed
down
a
little
i
sort
of
hoped
it
would
be
so
but
i
didn
t
expect
it
quite
so
neither
did
i
said
mona
shyly
but
you
oh
yes
we
see
said
kit
the
picturesque
spot
murmuring
brook
whispering
trees
of
course
you
couldn
t
help
it
bless
you
my
children
and
now
i
want
somebody
to
go
out
and
get
engaged
to
me
who
will
volunteer
not
today
kit
said
patty
laughing
let
troubles
come
singly
for
once
today
for
this
tomorrow
for
yours
come
on
people
i
can
t
wait
to
get
home
and
tell
adele
chapter
viii
a
ride
together
adele
was
duly
surprised
and
pleased
to
learn
that
mona
and
roger
were
engaged
and
declared
they
should
have
an
announcement
dinner
that
very
night
let
s
make
it
a
real
party
said
patty
with
a
dance
as
if
we
didn
t
dance
every
night
said
elise
laughing
but
it
will
seem
more
like
a
party
if
we
put
on
our
best
and
decorate
the
table
added
daisy
so
the
girls
put
their
heads
together
to
see
what
they
could
do
in
the
way
of
effective
and
appropriate
decoration
we
might
give
her
a
shower
suggested
marie
after
mona
had
left
the
room
what
sort
of
a
shower
what
could
we
buy
and
where
could
we
buy
it
there
s
that
little
bazaar
down
in
the
village
but
there
s
nothing
decent
there
said
patty
no
agreed
marie
and
we
don
t
want
to
give
mona
cheap
little
well
we
can
t
have
a
shower
that
s
out
of
the
question
declared
daisy
but
i
to
have
a
shower
persisted
patty
it
will
be
no
fun
at
all
to
give
her
a
shower
after
we
get
back
to
new
york
i
m
going
to
invent
some
way
to
give
it
to
her
but
there
isn
t
any
yes
there
is
daisy
now
listen
suppose
we
each
give
her
some
pretty
trinket
or
thing
of
our
huh
worn
out
old
things
no
of
course
not
but
i
ve
a
little
pearl
ring
that
mona
likes
awfully
well
and
i
care
a
lot
for
it
myself
too
so
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
gift
just
because
i
like
it
that
s
a
good
idea
patty
said
adele
i
have
a
white
and
silver
scarf
that
mona
just
raves
over
it
s
egyptian
you
know
and
of
some
value
i
think
she
d
like
these
things
that
we
have
personally
used
quite
as
well
as
new
things
you
know
mona
can
buy
anything
she
wants
but
this
personal
note
would
touch
her
i
m
perhaps
you
re
right
daisy
said
thoughtfully
i
ve
an
exquisite
lace
handkerchief
i
d

which

a
chick
was
passing
and
patty
beckoned
to
him

you
chauff
me
over
to
see
maude
she
asked
as
she
still
held
the
receiver
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
if
you
ve
the
slightest
desire
to
go
there
my
lady
well
all
right
maude
i
ll
come
but
only
for
a
few
when
do
we
start
queen
of
my
heart
and
channing
bowed
before
her
in
a
few
minutes
i
ll
scoot
and
dress
and
you
meet
me
here
at
three
your
word
is
my
bond
i
ll
be
on
patty
flew
to
her
room
and
rang
for
the
treasure
of
a
sarah
the
girl
was
rapidly
becoming
a
deft
ladies
and
when
patty
merely
said
rose
crêpe
sarah
she
took
from
the
wardrobe
the
pretty
afternoon
gown
of
crêpe
de
chine
and
went
at
once
to
get
silk
stockings
and
slippers
to
match
as
well
as
the
right
hat
veil
and
accessories
on
time
patty
stood
again
in
the
hall
channing
appeared
and
at
the
same
time
kit
cameron
strolled
in
oh
kit
said
patty
however
you
think
of
that
crazy
scheme
of
fortune
telling
my
brain
is
full
of
nonsense
patty
and
sometimes
it
strikes
out
like
but
about
my
fortune
did
you
just
make
it
all
up
out
of
the
solid
or
was
there
car
s
ready
patty
interrupted
channing
leave
that
investigation
till
we
come
i
don
t
want
to
and
patty
looked
from
one
of
the
men
to
the
other
i
want
to
hear
about
it
now
i
say
kit
you
drive
me
instead
of
chick
won
t
you
oh
now
that
isn
t
fair
and
channing
looked
decidedly
annoyed
you
promised
me
no
i
didn
t
i
asked
you
that
s
quite
different
from
promising
now
don
t
sulk
and
i
ll
give
you
an
extra
dance
two
well
yes
two
then
you
greedy
boy
now
run
away
and
but
is
this
all
right
said
kit
as
he
hesitated
to
take
channing
s
place
it
doesn
t
seem
so
to
me
chick
retorted
but
what
miss
fairfield
says
goes
he
turned
on
his
heel
very
much
out
of
sorts
at
patty
s
perverse
ways
and
as
she
saw
the
look
on
his
face
and
the
uncertainty
on
kit
s
countenance
patty
broke
into
a
laugh
where
are
you
going
patty
said
farnsworth
coming
out
of
the
house
over
to
poland
spring
house
if
i
can
get
anybody
to
drive
me
these
boys
are
both
unwilling
you
drive
me
little
billee
farnsworth
looked
at
her
a
moment
with
the
expression
of
one
who
can
scarcely
believe
his
own
ears
then
just
as
kit
began
to
exclaim
in
indignation
big
bill
took
his
place
beside
her
and
started
the
car
what
possessed
your
kind
heart
to
give
me
this
pleasure
he
said
and
his
voice
was
so
gentle
it
took
from
the
words
all
suggestion
of
sarcasm
or
satire
the
others
were
so
tiresome
i
don
t
think
it
s
such
a
favour
to
allow
a
man
to
drive
a
car
for
you
do
you
it
depends
on
the
man
and
the
one
who
grants
the
favour
to
me
this
is
a
decided
boon
do
you
realise
little
girl
i
never
get
a
word
with
you
nowadays
you
never
allow
it
you
re
so
wrapped
up
in
channing
and
cameron
you
ve
no
eyes
or
ears
for
any
one
oh
little
billee
what
a
taradiddle
but
when
people
don
t
believe
what
people
say
people
can
t
expect
people
wait
so
many
people
get
me
all
mixed
up
and
i
do
believe
you
always
if
i
doubted
your
word
about
that
telephone
it
was
because
i
was
misinformed
you
yes
tell
me
how
it
patty
was
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
she
had
big
bill
where
she
wanted
him
apologising
for
his
abominable
disbelief
in
her
veracity
tell
me
who
told
you
stories
about
not
stories
exactly
i
wanted
the
long
distance
telephone
that
night
and
when
i
went
to
the
desk
the
telephone
clerk
said
you
were
using
it
talking
to
a
van
reypen
and
would
i
wait
till
you
and
of
course
you
thought
i
called
phil
whereas
he
called
me
all
right
billee
boy
you
re
and
then
he
called
you
again
last
night
is
this
a
habit
of
his
oh
billee
that
s
just
what
i
asked
him
but
how
did
you
know
he
telephoned
last
night
clerk
again
i
was
in
the
office
and
as
you
weren
t
home
and
the
new
york
call
might
have
been
from
your
father
i
answered
it
was
van
reypen
and
as
he
wanted
to
know
where
you
were
of
course
i
told
him
patty
what
he
want
does
he
telephone
you
every
night
well
let
me
see
what
he
did
want
he
telephoned
last
night
i
believe
to
apologise
for
telephoning
the
night
before
what
nonsense
yes
he
did
don
t
you
disbelieve
me
again
of
course
i
won
t
all
right
then
what
did
he
say
the
first
night
that
he
had
to
apologise
for
oh
fiddlestrings
billee
it
was
nothing
of
any
consequence
i
may
as
well
tell
you
though
he
just
wanted
to
be
invited
up
oh
he
did
he
yes
he
did
he
and
i
told
him
yes
patty
what
did
you
tell
him
patty
turned
her
pretty
head
and
smiled
full
in
farnsworth
s
face
her
blue
eyes
were
sparkling
her
golden
curls
were
tossed
by
the
wind
her
red
lips
wore
a
roguish
expression
as
she
said
i
just
told
him
i
didn
t
want
patty
did
you
really
i
sure
did
little
billee
but
it
wasn
t
quite
what
do
you
mean
well
you
see
really
i
want
him
little
oh
only
a
little
i
knew
didn
t
and
so
i
told
him
didn
patty
what
a
torment
you
are
patty
s
eyes
opened
wide
well
i
like
that
a
torment
because
i
headed
him
off
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
don
t
want
him
if
that
torments
you
i
ll
telephone
him
tonight
to
come
on
there
there
blue
eyes
take
it
easy
don
t
want
him
and
don
t
want
him
and
won
t
have
him
now
let
it
go
at
big
bill
smiled
down
happily
at
the
that
at
first
looked
up
at
him
a
little
angrily
and
then
smiled
back
and
now
peaches
the
van
reypen
incident
is
closed
next
will
you
kindly
tell
me
why
you
went
in
so
strong
for
the
kent
lady
s
concert
two
reasons
billee
said
patty
calmly
first
and
i
hope
most
because
i
was
sorry
for
her
and
wanted
to
help
her
out
in
her
trouble
and
second
well
oh
because
i
m
a
silly
vain
thing
and
i
wanted
to
sing
in
public
and
have
people
think
i
was
madame
thingamajig
and
i
like
to
have
my
voice
praised
i
m
just
a
little
idiot
you
certainly
why
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
not
half
so
ashamed
as
you
ought
to
it
isn
t
a
crime
to
be
vain
of
your
accomplishments
and
i
owned
up
i
was
silly
do
you
hate
silly
people
sometimes
not
always
but
look
here
patty
seriously
you
don
t
want
to
be
intimate
with
maude
kent
she
may
be
a
nice
girl
all
right
but
she
has
been
an
actress
and
that
is
not
the
sort
of
people
for
you
to
associate
i
guess
you
don
t
know
her
very
well
bill
she
is
a
noble
spirit
and
she
devotes
her
life
to
earning
a
living
for
herself
and
her
mother
and
sister
i
never
knew
a
more
devoted
daughter
and
sister
than
she
is
and
i
adore
farnsworth
sighed
i
feared
you
d
fly
off
like
that
patty
you
re
so
susceptible
and
impressionistic
but
you
must
know
that
she
is
not
the
sort
of
girl
you
ve
been
accustomed
to
so
much
the
worse
for
the
sort
of
girl
i
know
then
idle
unoccupied
creatures
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
fleeting
pleasures
of
the
hour
maude
kent
is
worth
a
dozen
of
them
when
it
comes
to
nobility
of
purpose
and
energy
of
attainment
what
do
you
know
about
her
bill
that
admirable
only
that
patty
that
she
has
been
on
the
vaudeville
stage
i
met
her
personally
only
two
or
three
times
and
i
took
little
interest
in
her
but
i
hate
to
see
you
grow
fond
of
her
are
you
going
to
see
her
today
i
am
but
you
need
not
see
her
you
can
wait
for
me
in
the
hotel
parlour
i
m
sorry
i
brought
no
you
re
not
you
re
glad
and
i
ll
not
wait
in
any
parlour
i
m
going
with
you
all
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
patty
felt
relieved
for
she
had
no
idea
of
what
maude
wanted
and
she
feared
it
might
be
to
sing
again
this
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
once
was
quite
enough
when
they
reached
the
hotel
they
sent
up
their
names
and
miss
kent
came
down
she
received
them
in
a
small
reception
room
where
they
could
be
alone
you
remember
farnsworth
said
patty
after
she
had
greeted
maude
yes
indeed
very
well
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
surely
no
one
could
criticise
the
gentle
manner
and
soft
voice
and
bill
farnsworth
looked
at
her
more
kindly
than
he
had
intended
to
and
now
what
s
it
all
about
asked
patty
when
they
were
seated
for
maude
i
must
not
stay
but
a
few
minutes
it
s
the
night
of
the
announcement
party
and
i
ve
a
lot
to
do
for
the
very
well
i
ll
tell
you
in
a
few
words
stengel
the
manager
heard
you
sing
here
last
night
and
he
wants
an
interview
with
you
with
an
idea
of
your
going
on
the
stage
in
light
what
and
patty
looked
amazed
while
farnsworth
bit
his
lips
to
restrain
what
he
wanted
to
say
yes
he
says
you
have
a
delightful
voice
but
more
than
that
you
have
charm
and
a
decided
ability
to
make
good
in
the
parts
for
which
he
should
cast
why
maude
you
must
be
crazy
to
think
for
a
minute
that
i
d
consider
such
a
proposition
i
wouldn
t
dream
of
it
and
i
couldn
t
do
it
yes
you
could
and
i
knew
you
d
feel
this
way
at
first
but
after
you
think
it
miss
kent
and
farnsworth
s
tones
were
cold
and
incisive
i
know
miss
fairfield
and
her
people
quite
well
enough
to
speak
with
authority
in
this
matter
and
i
assure
you
it
is
worse
than
useless
for
you
to
suggest
such
a
i
knew
it
strike
you
so
at
first
farnsworth
and
perhaps
patty
s
parents
also
but
i
feel
sure
that
if
it
were
properly
put
before
miss
kent
and
farnsworth
rose
there
is
no
way
of
properly
putting
it
before
them
they
would
not
even
listen
and
now
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
us
come
but
bill
come
patty
at
must
you
obey
him
asked
miss
kent
she
must
said
farnsworth
sternly
come
i
must
said
patty
and
with
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
she
rose
i
ll
see
you
again
about
this
maude
she
said
she
ll
never
see
you
again
about
this
or
anything
else
farnsworth
declared
and
his
face
was
set
and
his
voice
hard
good
day
miss
good
afternoon
farnsworth
the
two
started
home
in
silence
patty
s
mind
was
full
of
conflicting
emotions
the
idea
of
going
on
the
stage
was
so
ridiculously
unthinkable
as
to
be
of
no
importance
but
the
fact
that
she
had
been
asked
to
do
so
filled
her
with
a
strange
pride
and
satisfaction
it
was
after
a
long
time
that
farnsworth
said
gently
patty
you
re
so
kinds
of
a
yes
sir
and
patty
sighed
partly
from
relief
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
scold
and
partly
because
she
agreed
with
him
now
you
see
why
i
didn
t
want
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
kent
well
i
don
t
see
as
she
has
done
me
any
you
don
t
why
she
has
put
that
fool
idea
into
your
head
and
you
ll
let
it
simmer
and
stew
there
until
you
begin
to
think
that
maybe
it
be
nice
to
go
on
the
oh
billee
i
wouldn
t
do
any
such
a
thing
no
not
but
after
you
mull
over
it
and
especially
if
she
ever
gets
hold
of
you
again
which
pray
heaven
she
never
goodness
me
little
billee
how
would
i
look
on
the
stage
why
i
d
be
lost
among
all
the
big
girls
they
have
you
d
all
right
that
s
the
worst
of
it
now
see
here
patty
make
me
a
solemn
promise
will
you
not
that
you
won
t
go
on
the
stage
but
that
if
you
ever
of
doing
so
you
ll
tell
me
first
will
you
promise
me
that
and
patty
promised
chapter
ix
the
shower
the
announcement
party
was
great
fun
in
every
way
it
was
made
to
seem
like
a
formal
party
and
not
just
the
gathering
of
the
clans
adele
received
the
guests
in
the
ballroom
with
mona
by
her
side
adele
was
gorgeous
in
her
best
evening
gown
a
velvet
and
mona
in
white
net
looked
like
a
débutante
patty
took
especial
pains
with
her
toilette
though
it
was
not
entirely
necessary
for
patty
looked
well
in
anything
she
chose
a
white
crêpe
whose
bewildering
masses
of
tulle
ruchings
veiled
a
skirt
of
silver
lace
the
bodice
of
silver
lace
was
ruched
and
draped
with
the
soft
crêpe
and
patty
s
pretty
throat
and
dimpled
arms
emerged
as
from
a
wave
of
sea
foam
her
golden
hair
was
massed
in
the
prevailing
fashion
caught
with
two
pins
of
carved
jade
verra
good
eddie
patty
remarked
to
sarah
as
she
viewed
her
completed
self
in
the
mirror
miss
said
the
maid
unfamiliar
with
patty
s
nonchalant
use
of
catch
phrases
i
said
you
done
noble
patty
returned
absently
as
she
rearranged
the
jade
pins
she
wore
no
other
ornaments
and
catching
up
a
long
floating
scarf
of
white
tulle
spangled
with
silver
she
ran
downstairs
but
remembering
the
occasion
she
made
a
most
dignified
entrance
to
the
reception
room
and
bowed
exaggeratedly
to
adele
so
pleased
she
murmured
offering
her
fingertips
and
miss
galbraith
may
i
wish
you
all
joy
and
felicity
and
happiness
and
come
come
patty
give
somebody
else
a
chance
don
t
babble
your
good
wishes
all
night
she
turned
to
see
kit
waiting
his
turn
and
she
laughingly
gave
way
to
him
isn
t
it
fine
to
see
the
men
in
their
evening
togs
she
exclaimed
turning
to
elise
i
m
so
used
to
seeing
them
in
flannels
or
golf
things
i
scarcely
recognise
recognise
me
implored
channing
i
m
the
sweet
young
thing
you
promised
three
extra
dances
three
nothing
returned
patty
carelessly
i
m
not
sure
i
shall
dance
tonight
anyway
i
shall
spend
my
time
admiring
mona
she
looks
so
mona
did
look
sweet
the
occasion
brought
a
look
of
shyness
to
her
face
which
was
as
becoming
as
it
was
unusual
roger
stood
by
proudly
gazing
at
her
as
he
was
in
turn
congratulated
and
chaffed
by
the
men
dinner
was
announced
and
jim
kenerley
offered
his
arm
to
mona
while
adele
followed
the
pair
with
roger
the
orchestra
played
the
wedding
march
and
channing
who
stood
next
to
patty
escorted
her
the
rotation
of
the
table
seats
had
been
changed
for
the
occasion
and
adele
and
jim
sat
opposite
one
another
with
their
guests
of
honour
at
their
right
hands
the
others
sat
where
they
chose
and
channing
deftly
manœuvred
to
place
patty
next
to
kenerley
as
he
dropped
into
the
chair
at
her
left
who
s
the
great
little
old
machiavelli
he
said
chuckling
didn
t
i
arrange
that
just
about
right
you
see
if
i
put
you
next
to
kenerley
you
won
t
give
all
your
undivided
attention
as
you
would
with
any
of
the
well
if
you
aren
t
the
i
am
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
i
cheerfully
admit
it
and
i
ve
practically
got
you
all
to
myself
for
the
whole
dinner
time
you
can
t
get
away
oh
joy
why
is
it
such
a
feat
how
do
you
know
that
i
m
not
equally
crazy
with
joy
to
sit
by
you
oh
patty
if
i
could
believe
that
what
things
you
say
to
a
fellow
do
you
it
considering
i
ve
only
known
you
a
few
days
i
couldn
t
really
mean
it
you
see
i
make
friendships
very
slowly
moreover
i
never
mean
anything
i
say
at
dinner
table
talk
is
an
art
i
m
proficient
in
it
and
i
know
the
rules
and
the
first
one
is
never
be
yes
i
know
that
too
but
after
dinner
say
out
on
that
moonlit
corner
of
the
there
isn
t
any
moon
that
s
why
i
refer
to
it
at
the
dinner
table
i
don
t
mean
it
you
see
well
out
in
that
unmoonlit
corner
then
will
you
tell
me
one
thing
me
truly
certainly
i
ll
tell
you
two
things
truly
even
three
if
you
like
but
they
must
be
things
of
my
own
first
yes
then
it
will
be
my
turn
and
i
shall
ask
you
something
very
then
i
shall
run
away
my
mind
is
so
full
of
important
things
just
now
that
it
simply
won
t
hold
another
you
don
t
know
me
yet
i
m
a
man
who
always
has
his
own
how
interesting
i
don
t
think
i
ever
knew
one
before
all
the
men
i
have
known
have
politely
deferred
to
indeed
you
must
be
longing
for
a
not
only
that
but
it
is
positively
necessary
that
i
talk
to
my
man
now
where
are
your
manners
that
you
have
so
long
neglected
your
lady
with
thee
conversing
i
forgot
all
manners
also
the
fair
miss
homer
is
absorbed
in
peyton
s
gay
well
give
her
a
change
then
marie
please
turn
this
way
channing
is
dying
to
talk
to
marie
turned
with
a
pretty
smile
and
patty
gave
her
attention
to
jim
you
see
jim
she
said
this
is
a
formal
dinner
and
you
must
observe
the
fifteen
minute
rule
it
isn
t
like
our
meals
mona
how
do
you
like
being
guest
of
honour
i
m
a
little
embarrassed
said
mona
who
wasn
t
at
all
but
i
m
getting
along
somehow
isn
t
roger
splendid
the
naïveté
of
mona
s
gaze
at
her
newly
betrothed
made
jim
kenerley
chuckle
you
ll
do
mona
he
said
the
table
decorations
were
as
appropriate
as
they
could
be
made
with
little
to
work
with
patty
had
contrived
a
chime
of
wedding
bells
of
white
tissue
paper
for
the
centrepiece
and
at
each
plate
was
an
orange
cored
and
holding
a
few
flowers
of
various
sorts
these
are
orange
blossoms
adele
explained
though
not
quite
the
conventional
style
they
show
our
good
the
feast
went
on
gaily
and
after
the
dessert
the
shower
took
place
the
head
waiter
brought
in
a
tray
on
which
were
the
gifts
the
girls
had
collected
for
mona
they
were
beautiful
and
things
and
the
personal
element
they
represented
endeared
them
to
the
pleased
recipient
you
darling
people
she
exclaimed
you
couldn
t
have
done
anything
that
would
please
me
more
it
is
heavenly
kind
of
you
and
i
love
you
for
it
i
shall
use
them
all
at
so
mona
slipped
patty
s
ring
on
her
finger
threw
adele
s
scarf
round
her
shoulders
and
tucking
the
wonderful
lace
handkerchief
in
her
belt
she
waved
the
fan
to
and
fro
the
centrepiece
which
marie
managed
to
get
finished
in
time
mona
calmly
laid
in
place
under
her
own
dinner
plate
and
she
declared
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
now
for
shower
said
jim
it
isn
t
fair
that
the
should
get
all
the
loot
so
we
take
pleasure
in
presenting
to
our
distinguished
least
friend
and
some
few
tokens
of
our
approval
of
his
course
myself
i
offer
these
dainty
boudoir
slippers
knowing
that
they
will
be
acceptable
not
only
for
their
artistic
merit
but
for
their
intrinsic
value
take
them
farrington
with
my
tearful
wish
for
your
kenerley
gave
roger
a
parcel
tied
up
in
tissue
paper
and
ribbons
which
when
opened
disclosed
a
furiously
gaudy
and
pair
of
slippers
he
had
unearthed
them
at
the
bazaar
in
the
village
where
they
had
doubtless
been
on
sale
since
the
early
eighties
everybody
laughed
at
the
grotesque
things
but
roger
in
the
mood
of
the
moment
made
a
gay
and
graceful
speech
of
thanks
then
bob
peyton
presented
a
smoking
set
this
was
an
impossible
affair
of
china
the
ash
tray
bore
the
cheerful
motto
of
ashes
to
ashes
and
the
tobacco
jar
was
so
clouded
with
artistic
smoke
wreaths
that
kit
declared
it
ought
to
be
labelled
dust
to
cameron
s
gift
was
a
tie
case
evidently
fashioned
by
feminine
fingers
it
was
of
pink
silk
a
little
faded
embroidered
with
blue
tasty
isn
t
it
said
kit
holding
it
up
for
general
admiration
i
hesitated
a
long
time
between
this
and
a
sponge
bag
the
other
would
be
more
useful
but
there
s
something
so
fetching
about
this
i
couldn
t
get
away
from
don
t
let
get
you
away
from
it
cameron
said
roger
i
d
hate
to
deprive
you
of
anything
you
admire
so
sincerely
take
it
from
no
roger
said
kit
firmly
i
can
not
take
it
from
you
i
give
it
to
you
little
grudgingly
tis
true
i
give
it
i
may
never
have
another
chance
to
make
you
an
announcement
shower
and
so
on
this
spicious
casion
i
stop
at
you
re
a
noble
fellow
cameron
and
roger
s
voice
was
surcharged
with
emotion
of
some
sort
i
accept
your
gift
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
given
and
i
trust
i
may
some
day
have
the
opportunity
to
shower
you
in
i
hope
to
goodness
you
will
farrington
and
i
now
thank
you
in
postpone
those
thanks
please
broke
in
channing
your
time
s
up
i
say
old
top
here
s
the
best
prize
yet
i
offer
you
this
picture
frame
but
it
is
no
ordinary
picture
frame
observe
it
is
made
of
birch
bark
in
neat
pattern
and
decorated
with
real
pine
cones
securely
glued
on
no
danger
of
their
fetching
loose
i
ve
tested
em
now
in
this
highly
artistic
if
a
trifle
ponderous
setting
you
can
place
miss
galbraith
s
portrait
and
wear
it
next
your
heart
or
dream
with
it
beneath
your
pillow
to
be
sure
it
is
pretty
big
and
heavy
for
either
of
these
uses
but
s
what
a
bit
of
inconvenience
compared
to
the
sentiment
of
the
thing
channing
held
out
an
enormous
and
cumbersome
frame
of
heavy
pine
cones
glued
to
a
board
back
a
fright
of
a
thing
made
by
some
of
the
native
country
people
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
jesting
gifts
all
came
from
the
little
village
shop
where
native
talent
was
more
in
evidence
than
good
taste
heavenly
exclaimed
roger
casting
his
eyes
toward
the
ceiling
look
mona
is
it
not
a
peach
will
you
give
me
a
miniature
of
your
sweet
face
to
grace
it
oh
you
will
roger
s
absurd
expression
and
exaggerated
enthusiasm
sent
them
all
off
into
paroxysms
of
laughter
and
mona
had
no
need
for
reply
farrington
old
man
said
bill
farnsworth
then
brace
yourself
i
have
the
best
gift
yet
for
you
the
most
appropriate
and
combining
a
graceful
sentiment
with
a
charming
usefulness
behold
from
voluminous
folds
of
white
tissue
paper
bill
shook
out
an
oriental
robe
of
silk
it
was
really
gorgeous
and
looked
as
if
made
for
a
chinese
mandarin
there
were
dragons
in
raised
work
and
borders
of
chrysanthemums
bill
flung
it
round
roger
to
whose
stalwart
form
the
strange
garb
was
most
becoming
everybody
exclaimed
in
admiration
only
foolish
gifts
had
been
looked
for
and
this
was
worthy
of
real
praise
the
long
loose
sleeves
hung
gracefully
down
and
the
obi
or
sash
was
fringed
with
silk
tassels
a
stunning
thing
exclaimed
adele
where
you
get
it
bill
san
francisco
returned
farnsworth
but
my
heart
is
broken
you
have
none
of
you
noticed
the
real
sentiment
the
reason
for
the
gift
oh
how
dense
you
are
what
do
you
mean
asked
adele
puzzled
can
t
you
see
cried
farnsworth
where
are
your
wits
why
should
i
give
that
thing
to
farrington
they
all
looked
blank
till
suddenly
it
dawned
on
patty
oh
little
billee
she
cried
oh
you
clever
clever
thing
oh
girls
don
t
you
see
it
s
a
then
they
did
see
and
they
cheered
and
complimented
farnsworth
on
his
witty
gift
it
s
so
clever
and
so
beautiful
i
think
i
shall
take
it
myself
mona
declared
and
roger
tossed
it
over
to
her
with
all
my
worldly
as
well
begin
at
once
he
said
with
a
mock
air
of
resignation
the
shower
over
they
went
to
the
ballroom
to
dance
of
course
sir
roger
de
coverly
was
first
on
the
programme
and
after
that
the
more
modern
dances
patty
tried
to
evade
chick
channing
for
he
was
growing
a
bit
insistent
in
his
attentions
take
me
for
a
veranda
stroll
kit
she
said
as
she
saw
channing
approaching
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
that
fortune
business
but
first
how
did
you
ever
come
to
think
of
it
oh
you
know
my
fatal
facility
for
practical
jokes
come
sit
in
this
palmy
bower
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
i
know
and
then
they
sauntered
in
to
the
pretty
nook
and
sat
down
among
the
palms
you
see
kit
went
on
i
haven
t
played
a
joke
in
i
dunno
when
and
i
just
to
get
one
off
so
when
i
was
prowling
around
and
struck
that
empty
shack
the
idea
sprang
to
my
o
er
clever
brain
i
fixed
it
up
with
bobbink
the
rest
is
history
bobsy
is
a
great
boy
though
a
little
fresh
he
got
the
for
my
face
and
the
rugs
and
things
he
fixed
them
all
in
the
old
shanty
and
then
he
carried
out
the
toothache
farce
in
accordance
with
my
yes
he
did
very
well
but
i
mean
about
the
fortunes
how
did
you
know
about
the
man
daisy
is
so
interested
in
one
who
wants
to
be
mayor
sh
that
s
a
state
secret
i
know
lots
of
things
but
i
keep
them
to
all
right
said
patty
seeing
he
was
in
earnest
but
about
somebody
leaving
me
money
did
you
make
up
not
entirely
and
kit
still
looked
serious
perhaps
you
will
receive
a
legacy
some
day
but
did
you
note
what
i
told
you
about
your
fate
no
said
patty
as
she
ran
away
back
to
the
house
chapter
x
sweetheart
the
days
sped
all
too
quickly
at
freedom
castle
and
on
one
golden
shining
september
afternoon
patty
realised
that
the
next
day
they
were
all
to
go
home
i
don
t
want
to
go
billy
boy
she
said
wistfully
she
was
sitting
in
a
swing
that
she
had
herself
contrived
and
chick
had
achieved
for
her
it
was
a
tangle
of
wistaria
vine
pulled
down
from
the
great
oak
tree
that
it
had
climbed
and
fashioned
into
a
loop
this
they
had
decorated
with
more
sprays
of
the
parent
vine
itself
and
often
patty
or
the
others
added
autumn
leaves
or
trailing
creepers
or
bunches
of
goldenrod
or
sumach
till
the
swing
was
usually
a
rather
dressy
affair
one
couldn
t
swing
far
in
it
but
then
one
didn
t
want
to
and
it
was
a
charming
place
to
sit
today
patty
in
a
chic
little
suit
of
tan
cloth
with
a
white
silk
blouse
and
a
crimson
tie
sat
in
the
swing
disconsolately
poking
into
the
earth
with
her
patent
leather
shoe
tip
i
m
sorry
patty
girl
and
big
bill
looked
regretfully
at
her
but
you
see
the
contract
with
the
servants
expires
tomorrow
and
they
are
all
anxious
to
get
away
you
know
i
ve
staid
longer
than
i
intended
yes
cause
i
begged
you
to
and
patty
smiled
at
him
now
if
i
beg
you
some
more
will
you
stay
some
more
in
a
if
i
possibly
could
but
it
s
you
know
i
just
came
up
for
a
few
days
to
ratify
the
papers
of
transference
and
see
to
some
business
matters
and
i
ve
all
sorts
of
important
duties
beckoning
to
me
with
both
but
if
i
beckon
to
you
with
both
patty
held
out
her
pretty
hands
and
slowly
beckoned
with
each
slender
forefinger
don
t
tempt
me
you
little
witch
you
know
i
d
do
anything
in
this
world
for
you
that
didn
t
conflict
with
wouldn
t
you
conflict
your
me
billee
patty
s
voice
was
wheedlesome
and
her
face
was
very
sweet
duty
yes
bill
looked
stern
but
my
duty
to
others
oh
i
m
sorry
dear
but
i
must
disappoint
you
my
employers
expect
me
in
boston
tomorrow
night
and
i
must
not
fail
well
can
t
we
stay
here
even
if
you
go
away
jim
and
adele
could
manage
things
and
we
don
t
want
servants
we
could
sort
of
camp
out
i
m
a
good
cook
and
we
d
have
a
lovely
farnsworth
considered
he
looked
far
off
and
his
fine
brows
knit
as
he
thought
over
patty
s
request
she
looked
at
him
and
noted
the
cloud
that
came
over
his
blue
eyes
as
he
turned
to
her
and
said
no
apple
blossom
it
can
t
be
done
this
place
is
a
trust
to
me
in
a
way
and
i
m
responsible
i
may
not
leave
it
to
others
and
i
can
not
remain
myself
so
there
s
no
help
for
it
i
must
refuse
there
was
an
air
of
finality
about
bill
s
tones
that
told
patty
there
was
no
use
in
further
coaxing
what
s
the
matter
patty
he
went
on
it
isn
t
like
you
to
tease
so
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
could
give
you
what
you
ask
it
hurts
me
worse
than
you
know
to
refuse
you
anything
but
i
wouldn
t
be
worthy
of
the
trust
reposed
in
me
if
i
failed
in
my
i
hate
duty
said
patty
petulantly
it
s
a
regular
nuisance
gently
little
girl
gently
what
has
happened
to
stir
you
up
so
it
s
more
than
this
ungratified
whim
of
not
staying
here
what
makes
you
think
that
i
don
t
think
i
know
it
why
patty
dear
i
know
every
expression
of
your
flower
face
every
look
in
your
blue
eyes
every
droop
of
your
sensitive
mouth
and
now
it
s
drooping
like
a
well
more
like
a
perverse
baby
than
anything
farnsworth
laughed
gently
as
patty
s
mouth
suddenly
curved
upward
in
an
involuntary
smile
then
as
it
drooped
again
she
said
i
believe
i
ll
tell
just
as
you
think
best
i
wonder
if
you
remember
a
promise
you
made
me
oh
little
billee
how
did
you
know
it
referred
to
that
something
seemed
to
hint
it
to
me
well
out
with
it
are
you
still
no
but
that
manager
stengel
won
t
give
up
the
idea
of
putting
me
on
in
light
opera
he
he
says
has
he
written
to
you
no
maude
wrote
me
what
he
said
any
way
he
thinks
i
have
remarkable
talent
you
haven
t
patty
not
remarkable
talent
you
have
a
pretty
voice
and
we
say
an
attractive
appearance
but
more
than
that
is
required
for
an
opera
success
even
light
opera
forgive
me
apple
blossom
i
know
i
am
hurting
your
feelings
but
it
s
better
you
should
know
the
then
why
does
stengel
want
to
put
me
into
his
plays
he
thinks
you
would
look
graceful
and
pretty
and
would
be
a
drawing
card
for
a
time
then
when
your
freshness
wore
off
as
it
would
soon
he
would
throw
you
over
like
a
well
freshness
hasn
t
worn
off
bill
farnsworth
and
patty
stood
up
her
eyes
dark
with
anger
at
his
words
and
i
don
t
care
for
any
more
of
your
opinions
on
a
subject
you
know
nothing
big
bill
farnsworth
smiled
well
was
it
a
little
ruffled
kitten
did
it
hate
to
be
misjudged
and
misunderstood
and
all
those
horrid
things
well
then
patty
see
here
i
ll
let
you
off
from
your
promise
to
tell
when
you
think
of
going
on
the
stage
but
you
must
tell
your
father
though
i
can
t
think
you
would
ever
take
such
a
step
without
consulting
patty
s
sudden
blush
and
a
guilty
look
in
her
eyes
made
bill
stare
at
her
sharply
and
then
he
said
oh
you
thinking
of
just
that
you
patty
fairfield
i
can
hardly
believe
it
you
poor
little
thing
you
be
infatuated
is
it
all
that
maude
kent
s
doing
or
have
you
haven
t
stengel
have
you
no
and
patty
looked
astounded
at
bill
s
vehemence
why
thank
heaven
i
thought
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
your
infatuation
might
be
for
him
all
right
you
go
home
and
talk
to
your
father
and
your
very
sensible
stepmother
and
i
ll
warrant
you
ll
forget
this
bee
in
your
bonnet
in
pretty
short
order
and
i
hope
you
ll
never
see
maude
kent
again
she
has
a
certain
charm
and
i
don
t
wonder
it
appealed
to
a
poor
little
innocent
like
you
promise
patty
you
ll
lay
the
case
before
your
parents
before
you
take
a
further
of
course
i
shan
t
go
against
their
wishes
patty
spoke
with
great
dignity
but
i
know
i
can
get
them
to
see
it
as
i
indeed
and
just
how
do
you
see
it
why
i
see
a
fine
and
worthy
career
opening
before
me
patty
scowled
as
the
grin
on
bill
s
face
grew
broader
a
more
valuable
career
than
you
are
able
to
appreciate
a
patty
oh
you
angel
goose
you
stop
you
ll
finish
me
and
farnsworth
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
and
does
career
shape
itself
to
your
clearer
vision
as
being
in
the
front
row
of
the
chorus
or
farther
bill
paused
stopped
by
the
look
of
horror
on
patty
s
face
chorus
she
cried
why
you
must
be
crazy
i
shall
be
a
prima
donna
one
of
the
reserved
exclusive
ones
that
nobody
ever
knows
much
about
i
m
not
going
to
have
my
picture
all
over
the
signboards
i
can
tell
you
that
nor
the
ash
barrels
well
for
relief
much
thanks
patty
i
could
laugh
at
you
till
i
cried
but
i
feel
more
like
crying
first
i
m
so
sorry
you
ve
got
this
whimsey
for
i
know
you
ll
hang
on
to
it
like
a
puppy
to
a
root
and
i
shan
t
be
here
to
look
after
you
but
your
father
will
do
why
where
are
you
going
west
again
i
don
t
know
just
when
but
very
soon
now
it
may
be
better
for
you
to
have
this
violently
and
get
over
it
quicker
like
mental
measles
but
unless
you
promise
me
faithfully
to
tell
it
all
word
your
father
and
mother
i
ll
write
them
myself
all
about
it
do
you
want
me
to
do
that
chick
thinks
it
would
be
great
fun
for
me
to
have
a
try
at
the
did
channing
say
that
bill
s
face
grew
dark
did
he
really
patty
yes
he
did
he
said
i
d
make
a
screaming
chick
s
only
joking
don
t
let
him
fool
no
he
wasn
t
joking
and
you
know
it
he
thinks
as
i
do
that
such
an
experience
would
broaden
patty
stop
do
you
want
to
be
broadened
at
the
expense
of
all
your
refinement
your
loveliness
your
dainty
girlhood
your
fresh
sweet
youth
patty
my
little
patty
listen
to
me
if
you
never
speak
to
me
again
if
you
scorn
me
utterly
at
least
take
my
word
for
this
you
must
not
you
not
think
of
this
thing
patty
come
to
me
instead
come
to
me
dear
let
me
take
care
of
you
and
find
pleasures
for
you
that
will
make
you
forget
this
it
is
not
foolishness
but
your
talk
is
i
don
t
care
to
hear
any
wait
dear
wait
a
moment
you
know
i
love
you
patty
more
than
life
itself
marry
me
and
let
me
teach
you
to
forget
this
whim
of
it
isn
t
a
whim
and
i
don
t
to
marry
you
this
idea
of
mine
is
not
a
whim
a
career
a
splendid
opportunity
that
calls
to
promises
wonderful
things
patty
and
farnsworth
s
face
was
white
is
that
true
you
said
just
now
that
don
t
to
marry
me
yes
it
s
true
and
patty
s
angry
blue
eyes
met
his
own
sad
ones
then
that
s
all
apple
blossom
you
may
go
now
i
ve
no
fear
that
you
will
do
anything
further
in
this
other
matter
without
your
father
s
knowledge
and
no
fear
that
he
will
allow
it
so
that
s
all
right
and
patty
flounced
off
yes
flounced
is
the
word
for
angry
and
chagrined
she
let
go
of
the
swing
she
was
holding
with
a
quick
push
and
whirling
about
walked
quickly
toward
the
house
the
next
morning
the
whole
party
left
for
new
york
it
s
been
perfectly
lovely
adele
said
to
farnsworth
and
if
it
were
not
for
my
baby
girlie
i
d
like
to
stay
another
week
but
i
hear
her
calling
me
at
boston
they
were
to
stay
over
night
the
party
really
broke
up
there
for
several
of
the
men
were
going
in
different
directions
but
adele
gathered
her
brood
of
girls
under
her
wing
and
carried
them
off
to
a
hotel
and
in
the
hotel
lobby
were
said
i
ve
had
my
telegram
said
farnsworth
and
i
have
to
go
to
arizona
at
once
wasn
t
it
lucky
it
didn
t
come
before
we
left
our
happy
hunting
grounds
yes
indeed
said
adele
it
s
been
a
beautiful
party
bill
and
we
just
love
you
for
giving
it
to
us
don
t
we
girls
yes
they
chorused
and
laughingly
interrupting
their
thanks
farnsworth
shook
hands
with
everybody
in
hasty
farewell
somehow
patty
was
the
last
and
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
a
gay
voice
was
heard
calling
out
oh
here
you
are
people
how
do
you
all
do
they
looked
up
to
see
philip
van
reypen
s
smiling
face
as
he
cordially
greeted
one
after
another
the
most
perfect
time
mona
was
saying
when
daisy
caught
her
up
oh
yes
the
time
what
do
you
think
phil
we
had
an
engagement
up
there
a
real
live
engagement
guess
the
guilty
parties
guess
us
exclaimed
roger
taking
mona
s
hand
and
looking
mock
sentimental
there
s
no
use
said
daisy
you
can
t
get
a
rise
out
of
them
they
forestall
you
every
time
congratulations
all
the
same
said
van
reypen
cordially
patty
how
are
you
sunburned
not
very
his
manner
was
so
cheery
and
his
chatter
so
gay
nobody
could
be
very
serious
and
the
farewells
became
short
and
perfunctory
roger
and
elise
were
taking
mona
with
them
to
newport
where
farrington
was
and
bob
peyton
was
going
directly
home
well
said
van
reypen
it
s
lucky
i
came
along
kenerley
to
help
you
care
for
your
charges
cameron
you
and
i
must
look
after
i
m
on
the
job
too
said
channing
you
can
t
shake
me
till
the
last
bell
rings
your
train
time
farnsworth
so
long
old
man
see
you
when
you
return
you
re
always
turning
and
returning
and
all
thanks
for
a
bully
time
everybody
cried
bill
in
his
most
genial
way
glad
you
enjoyed
it
and
hope
we
can
try
it
again
some
time
patty
and
with
a
swift
hand
clasp
and
a
quick
look
in
her
eyes
bill
swung
off
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
crowd
something
seemed
to
snap
in
patty
s
heart
a
cloud
swam
before
her
eyes
and
she
swayed
a
little
where
she
stood
all
right
girl
said
a
strong
calm
voice
in
her
ear
and
van
reypen
grasped
her
elbow
and
steadied
her
immediately
she
was
ashamed
of
her
passing
emotion
and
laughed
gaily
as
she
met
his
eyes
i
m
here
he
said
simply
you
ll
be
taken
care
wherever
you
drop
from
and
patty
suddenly
realised
the
queerness
of
his
presence
oh
i
m
the
little
busybody
who
finds
out
things
i
found
out
what
train
you
people
came
down
on
and
i
met
it
or
rather
i
tried
to
but
i
reached
it
just
as
you
left
the
station
for
this
hostelry
so
perforce
i
followed
you
up
now
may
i
attach
myself
to
your
cortège
kenerley
i
can
make
myself
useful
i
assure
you
are
you
staying
here
over
night
some
of
us
are
replied
adele
who
liked
phil
and
was
glad
to
see
him
then
be
my
guests
for
the
evening
we
ll
have
dinner
in
great
shape
and
do
a
show
and
just
round
up
boston
the
kenerleys
agreed
and
soon
the
festivities
began
by
the
party
sitting
down
for
afternoon
tea
in
the
hotel
tea
room
daisy
told
phil
of
patty
s
escapade
enacting
the
singer
m
lle
farini
what
a
lark
said
van
reypen
but
i
daresay
you
gave
the
audience
a
greater
treat
than
if
the
lady
herself
had
been
sure
she
did
declared
channing
i
tell
you
we
ll
see
patty
on
the
stage
yet
and
a
charming
prima
donna
she
would
make
too
i
believe
it
would
be
a
great
success
farnsworth
but
then
some
interruption
occurred
and
the
sentence
was
never
finished
in
the
evening
they
all
went
to
see
a
new
light
opera
that
was
exceedingly
popular
it
was
a
dainty
pretty
piece
of
foolery
full
of
dresden
ladies
and
knights
in
theatrical
armour
and
the
principal
singer
was
a
slight
person
much
like
patty
herself
you
could
give
that
diva
cards
and
spades
declared
chick
as
they
discussed
her
at
an
after
theatre
supper
why
patty
you
re
more
of
an
actress
than
she
is
this
and
a
thousand
times
said
philip
bill
farnsworth
says
i
m
enough
began
patty
slowly
and
then
she
stopped
short
and
changed
the
subject
she
wanted
to
think
it
out
for
herself
before
there
was
any
more
talk
about
it
so
if
any
one
recurred
to
the
matter
she
quickly
spoke
of
something
else
and
the
evening
passed
merrily
away
chapter
xi
a
bubble
burst
one
afternoon
about
a
week
later
philip
van
reypen
called
at
the
fairfields
home
in
new
york
being
informed
that
patty
was
out
he
asked
to
see
fairfield
and
nan
received
him
in
the
library
so
sorry
patty
isn
t
here
she
said
as
she
greeted
him
cordially
she
ll
be
sorry
perhaps
it
s
just
as
well
returned
philip
i
d
like
a
little
talk
with
you
look
here
nan
has
patty
said
anything
to
you
about
going
on
the
stage
unless
you
mean
a
fifth
avenue
stage
she
certainly
has
not
and
nan
smiled
at
the
idea
no
don
t
laugh
it
s
serious
you
know
i
met
the
crowd
coming
down
from
maine
at
boston
and
i
was
with
them
one
evening
well
they
talked
it
s
true
they
talked
about
patty
being
in
light
opera
some
time
why
philip
how
perfectly
ridiculous
it
was
entirely
a
joke
of
i
don
t
think
so
it
seems
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
that
farnsworth
put
her
up
to
bill
farnsworth
oh
i
can
t
think
he
well
patty
herself
said
to
me
that
farnsworth
said
she
was
enough
and
then
somehow
she
got
mixed
up
with
a
of
some
sort
who
used
to
be
an
actress
farnsworth
knew
her
in
san
francisco
i
believe
and
she
infatuated
patty
to
such
an
extent
i
never
heard
such
nonsense
why
hasn
t
patty
told
me
all
this
that
s
just
the
point
if
there
were
nothing
to
it
she
would
have
told
you
that
s
why
i
fear
she
has
taken
the
notion
i
can
t
think
it
yet
i
ll
ask
her
when
she
comes
i
m
not
sure
that
would
be
wise
why
don
t
you
wait
and
see
if
she
does
anything
in
the
matter
elise
farrington
said
that
a
manager
had
asked
to
see
patty
regarding
the
a
manager
nan
fairly
gasped
why
this
is
awful
what
would
her
father
say
but
wait
a
minute
let
s
look
at
the
thing
rationally
you
know
how
susceptible
patty
is
to
a
new
idea
or
a
new
influence
i
think
this
had
bewitched
the
child
and
to
chide
her
would
only
make
her
more
determined
to
stand
by
her
new
friend
why
not
deal
more
diplomatically
watch
patty
and
if
she
does
anything
queer
or
inexplicable
follow
it
up
and
see
what
it
means
of
course
you
know
nan
that
i
m
actuated
only
by
honest
interest
in
patty
s
oh
i
know
that
philip
and
i
m
very
glad
you
came
to
me
with
this
story
first
perhaps
it
won
t
be
necessary
to
speak
of
it
to
fairfield
at
least
not
yet
he
s
busy
and
a
little
bothered
just
now
with
some
business
matters
and
if
i
could
straighten
out
this
foolishness
without
letting
it
worry
him
i
d
be
we
ll
do
it
and
phil
spoke
heartily
we
ll
save
that
little
goosie
from
herself
of
course
you
know
i
worship
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
i
m
going
to
win
her
yet
you
think
i
ve
a
chance
don
t
you
i
don
t
see
why
not
phil
there
s
nobody
i
d
rather
see
patty
marry
than
you
but
she
is
determined
she
won
t
listen
to
such
a
thing
yet
she
says
she
has
too
much
fun
being
a
belle
to
tie
herself
down
to
any
one
man
and
perhaps
she
is
right
she
s
only
twenty
and
while
that
s
quite
old
enough
to
marry
if
she
wants
to
yet
it
s
young
enough
to
wait
a
while
if
she
i
quite
agree
to
that
it
s
only
that
i
want
to
be
on
the
spot
when
she
does
make
up
her
mind
to
marry
of
course
she
will
of
course
and
you
have
every
chance
now
as
to
this
other
matter
do
you
think
farnsworth
instigated
the
idea
i
gathered
that
from
different
things
that
were
said
and
the
actress
person
was
his
friend
and
i
know
that
he
took
patty
over
to
poland
spring
house
to
see
what
s
her
name
kent
kent
they
call
her
queer
patty
hasn
t
mentioned
her
i
agree
with
you
that
looks
as
if
she
took
the
thing
oh
perhaps
not
and
philip
rose
to
go
it
may
be
i
exaggerate
the
danger
but
i
m
so
fearful
of
that
capricious
nature
of
hers
never
can
tell
what
whim
she
ll
fly
at
that
s
true
and
i
m
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
putting
me
on
my
nan
said
nothing
to
her
husband
on
this
subject
but
she
watched
patty
more
carefully
she
was
clever
enough
not
to
let
the
supervision
be
apparent
but
it
was
unremittent
however
nothing
transpired
to
rouse
her
suspicions
in
any
way
patty
was
her
own
gay
sunny
self
planning
all
sorts
of
gaieties
and
employments
for
the
winter
season
she
had
by
no
means
given
up
or
neglected
her
club
that
was
for
the
purpose
of
giving
pleasure
to
or
other
working
women
and
she
thought
up
plans
for
raising
money
for
that
philanthropic
purpose
she
kept
up
her
membership
in
the
current
events
club
and
in
the
musical
society
to
which
she
belonged
and
she
showed
no
undue
interest
in
the
new
light
operas
that
were
successively
put
upon
the
stage
she
attended
most
of
these
but
she
had
always
had
a
liking
for
them
and
that
did
not
seem
to
nan
a
special
indication
of
histrionic
intent
but
one
evening
as
the
three
fairfields
sat
at
dinner
patty
was
called
to
the
telephone
she
left
the
table
and
after
a
time
returned
with
sparkling
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
dear
people
she
said
smiling
at
her
parents
i
ve
a
surprise
to
spring
on
you
will
you
be
astounded
to
learn
that
your
foolish
little
patty
had
a
chance
to
make
good
in
the
world
to
have
a
career
that
will
mean
fame
and
nan
almost
choked
an
icy
hand
seemed
to
clutch
at
her
throat
the
hour
had
struck
then
and
with
all
her
watchfulness
she
had
not
succeeded
in
preventing
it
it
perfectly
wonderful
patty
was
rattling
on
you
can
hardly
believe
it
hardly
can
myself
but
i
m
going
to
be
a
great
you
re
that
now
kiddie
said
her
father
who
had
no
idea
of
what
lay
back
of
this
introduction
yes
but
more
than
that
oh
nan
it
s
too
glorious
daddy
what
you
think
i
m
going
to
sing
in
light
opera
you
ve
often
done
that
he
returned
thinking
of
her
amateur
performances
one
of
your
favourite
gilbert
and
sullivan
ones
or
more
modern
this
time
patty
laughed
happily
you
don
t
get
it
yet
dadsy
i
mean
in
a
real
opera
on
the
real
what
just
say
that
again
my
old
ears
must
be
failing
i
m
going
to
be
a
real
prima
donna
on
the
stage
of
a
real
theatre
not
if
i
see
you
first
but
elucidate
this
very
extraordinary
i
but
even
as
she
began
to
speak
patty
caught
sight
of
nan
s
face
and
the
lack
of
sympathy
nay
more
the
look
of
positive
disapproval
she
saw
there
made
her
pause
a
moment
then
she
went
on
a
little
defiantly
i
suppose
it
will
strike
you
queer
at
first
but
you
ll
get
used
to
it
why
dads
i
found
out
while
i
was
up
in
down
in
maine
corrected
her
father
well
any
old
way
to
maine
but
i
discovered
that
i
have
a
voice
and
more
i
have
a
knack
a
taste
a
talent
even
for
the
stage
and
m
going
to
devote
my
life
to
devote
your
life
to
it
and
fairfield
s
tone
was
scathing
if
you
re
so
anxious
for
a
life
of
devotion
i
ll
put
you
in
a
convent
but
on
the
stage
not
if
the
court
knows
herself
patty
smiled
tolerantly
i
was
afraid
you
d
talk
like
that
at
first
it
shall
now
be
my
duty
and
my
pleasure
to
make
you
change
your
intelligent
mind
nan
you
ll
help
me
won
t
you
patty
asked
this
with
some
misgiving
for
nan
did
not
look
entirely
helpful
help
you
to
go
on
the
stage
was
the
smiling
retort
for
nan
quickly
decided
to
keep
the
discussion
in
a
light
key
if
possible
yes
indeed
after
some
reputable
physician
has
signed
a
certificate
of
your
lunacy
while
you
re
in
your
right
now
nancy
don
t
go
back
on
me
i
depend
on
you
to
talk
father
over
though
he
won
t
need
much
argument
i
m
look
here
patty
and
her
father
spoke
seriously
tell
me
just
what
you
re
driving
only
this
dad
i
ve
a
chance
to
go
on
the
stage
in
a
new
light
opera
and
i
want
to
whose
opera
do
you
mean
the
composer
i
do
not
i
mean
the
manager
or
owner
or
whoever
is
getting
you
mixed
up
with
well
the
manager
is
stengel
why
patty
he
s
manager
that
s
what
i
said
and
patty
beamed
at
him
and
he
is
coming
here
tonight
to
see
me
see
about
coming
here
yes
don
t
be
so
overcome
you
didn
t
know
your
little
goose
girl
would
turn
out
a
swan
did
you
but
there
s
a
misapprehension
somewhere
you
see
stengel
is
coming
here
yes
he
is
i
ve
just
telephoned
that
he
you
telephoned
stengel
well
not
directly
to
him
but
i
told
my
friend
miss
kent
that
she
might
bring
who
what
friend
miss
kent
i
met
her
in
maine
she
s
a
daddy
fairfield
look
as
if
you
d
been
struck
by
lightning
but
i
have
and
i
m
trying
to
crawl
out
from
under
the
débris
now
the
first
thing
you
do
my
child
you
fly
back
to
that
telephone
and
call
off
that
little
engagement
for
this
evening
tell
your
maine
friend
that
circumstances
over
which
you
have
control
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
receive
her
and
the
illustrious
manager
this
but
father
at
once
patty
fairfield
spoke
in
a
tone
that
patty
had
not
heard
since
she
was
a
little
girl
but
she
well
remembered
it
she
rose
without
a
word
and
did
as
she
was
bid
be
very
gentle
with
her
fred
nan
murmured
as
soon
as
patty
was
out
of
hearing
i
will
and
fairfield
flashed
a
glance
of
amused
understanding
at
his
wife
did
you
know
about
this
thing
only
vaguely
i
ll
tell
you
some
other
time
but
quash
the
scheme
decidedly
won
t
you
patty
came
back
her
face
a
little
flushed
her
lips
a
little
pouting
but
quite
evidently
ready
for
the
fray
i
did
as
you
told
me
father
she
began
but
i
think
you
ll
be
sorry
for
the
stand
you
ve
perhaps
so
girlie
but
i
don
t
want
my
sorrow
to
interfere
with
my
digestion
so
let
s
drop
the
whole
subject
till
after
it
had
always
been
a
rule
in
the
fairfield
household
never
to
discuss
unpleasant
subjects
at
table
so
patty
tacitly
agreed
and
during
the
rest
of
the
meal
there
was
only
gay
conversation
on
light
matters
now
then
said
fairfield
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
three
were
cosily
settled
in
the
pleasant
library
tell
me
over
again
and
tell
me
and
so
quietly
but
still
with
that
air
of
determination
patty
told
about
maude
kent
and
the
concert
at
poland
spring
and
how
stengel
was
interested
and
wanted
to
see
her
with
a
view
to
starring
her
in
light
opera
fairfield
sighed
for
he
foresaw
no
easy
task
in
trying
to
persuade
his
wilful
daughter
to
his
own
point
of
view
patty
dear
he
said
do
you
remember
when
you
were
a
little
girl
i
gave
you
a
lecture
on
proportion
i
do
daddy
and
i
ve
never
forgotten
it
well
put
it
in
practice
now
then
can
t
you
see
that
it
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
think
of
an
ignorant
untrained
girl
like
you
stepping
all
at
once
into
the
rôle
of
a
successful
prima
donna
but
more
experienced
people
than
you
think
i
no
they
don
t
dear
this
manager
knows
your
limitations
he
knows
you
have
no
stage
lore
or
experience
and
if
he
wants
you
it
is
only
because
of
your
dainty
and
charming
personality
and
because
there
is
a
certain
prestige
in
the
fact
of
a
society
girl
going
on
the
stage
but
as
soon
as
the
novelty
was
over
he
would
fling
you
aside
like
a
how
do
you
know
you
never
were
a
manager
patty
men
of
experience
in
this
world
don
t
have
to
adopt
a
profession
to
know
many
salient
points
regarding
it
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
take
my
word
that
i
do
know
enough
of
managers
and
their
ways
to
know
my
statement
is
true
nor
are
the
managers
altogether
wrong
it
is
their
business
to
get
performers
who
interest
the
public
and
they
have
a
right
to
use
their
efforts
toward
that
end
but
i
don
t
want
my
daughter
to
be
sacrificed
to
their
business
acumen
now
will
you
drop
this
wild
scheme
without
further
argument
or
shall
we
thresh
it
out
further
why
i
ve
no
intention
of
dropping
it
dad
and
patty
looked
amazed
at
the
idea
oh
lord
then
i
suppose
we
must
go
through
with
the
farce
all
right
go
back
to
the
telephone
and
have
the
stengel
man
come
right
here
and
may
i
oh
dadsy
i
knew
you
d
give
in
give
in
nothing
i
want
to
show
you
what
a
little
ninny
you
wait
a
minute
said
nan
as
patty
rose
and
walked
toward
the
telephone
table
suppose
we
don
t
ask
stengel
at
first
just
have
miss
kent
come
and
tell
us
about
good
agreed
fairfield
she
can
t
come
alone
tell
her
we
ll
send
the
car
for
her
i
d
like
to
go
straight
ahead
with
this
interesting
so
patty
telephoned
and
maude
kent
said
she
would
come
the
car
was
despatched
and
in
a
tremor
of
impatience
patty
waited
for
her
friend
s
arrival
the
elder
fairfields
made
no
further
allusion
to
the
subject
but
talked
on
other
matters
till
the
guest
was
announced
maude
kent
bustled
in
and
greeted
patty
effusively
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
she
acknowledged
introduction
to
the
other
two
with
gay
cordiality
and
seated
herself
in
the
middle
of
a
sofa
flinging
open
her
satin
evening
wrap
she
wore
a
gown
with
a
profusion
of
lace
and
a
great
deal
of
jewelry
patty
looked
at
her
a
little
surprised
for
she
gave
a
different
impression
from
the
girl
she
had
seen
before
she
couldn
t
herself
quite
define
the
difference
but
maude
seemed
less
refined
louder
somehow
here
in
the
fairfield
home
than
she
had
in
the
big
hotel
and
patty
wished
she
would
act
more
reserved
and
less
chatty
and
familiar
you
see
fairfield
maude
ran
on
we
just
have
our
patty
in
the
profesh
we
need
her
and
i
assure
you
she
ll
make
in
just
what
way
miss
kent
asked
fred
fairfield
his
keen
eyes
taking
in
the
visitor
s
every
move
oh
she
can
sing
you
know
and
she
s
a
looker
all
right
and
she
has
yes
decided
and
is
this
enough
you
think
to
assure
stengel
s
giving
her
say
a
contract
as
a
prima
donna
well
hardly
that
and
maude
laughed
heartily
you
men
will
have
your
little
joke
but
he
would
give
her
a
good
place
in
the
chorus
to
start
with
and
doubtless
patty
would
work
up
oh
yes
she
could
work
up
i
feel
sure
patty
is
not
afraid
of
hard
work
are
you
dearie
and
it
is
as
a
chorus
girl
that
stengel
wishes
to
engage
patty
fred
fairfield
s
voice
was
quiet
but
his
eyes
shot
gleams
of
indignation
why
yes
fairfield
she
couldn
t
expect
a
higher
position
at
and
would
she
be
assured
of
having
it
in
time
if
she
caught
on
with
the
public
if
stengel
took
a
liking
to
her
that
will
do
miss
kent
i
m
sure
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
decline
to
pursue
this
subject
further
my
daughter
most
certainly
will
not
go
into
any
venture
of
stengel
s
or
accept
any
other
position
on
the
stage
the
incident
is
there
was
something
in
fred
fairfield
s
face
that
forbade
the
indignant
rejoinder
maude
kent
was
about
to
make
and
it
was
with
a
sudden
accession
of
dignity
that
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
drew
her
wrap
about
her
very
well
she
said
it
is
closed
as
a
matter
of
explanation
let
me
say
that
my
interest
in
the
thing
is
a
legitimately
financial
one
stengel
gives
me
a
fair
commission
on
the
young
ladies
i
persuade
to
join
his
chorus
as
i
am
this
means
something
to
me
moreover
i
am
personally
fond
of
miss
fairfield
and
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
achieved
the
triumph
of
her
consent
but
since
it
is
impossible
i
can
only
bid
you
all
good
with
the
air
of
an
offended
queen
maude
kent
swept
from
the
room
and
the
fairfield
chauffeur
took
her
back
to
her
home
patty
you
everlasting
little
goose
said
fred
fairfield
as
he
took
his
daughter
in
his
arms
forget
it
there
s
no
harm
done
and
nobody
need
ever
know
how
foolish
you
were
your
bubble
s
burst
your
air
castle
is
in
ruins
but
your
old
father
is
still
here
to
look
after
you
and
laugh
with
you
over
your
ridiculous
schemes
now
forget
this
one
and
start
another
chapter
xii
middy
whither
away
patty
asked
nan
as
patty
came
downstairs
one
bright
morning
in
late
october
hatted
and
gowned
for
the
street
i
m
going
out
on
multifarious
errands
first
i
shall
make
a
certain
florist
i
wot
me
of
wish
he
had
never
been
born
what
you
think
i
ordered
pink
chrysanthemums
and
he
sent
yellow
could
villainy
go
further
and
then
i
ve
some
small
shopping
to
do
any
errands
no
unless
you
stop
in
at
the
photographer
s
and
see
if
my
pictures
are
all
right
i
will
by
patty
got
into
the
big
car
with
its
open
top
and
drew
in
long
breaths
of
the
crisp
autumn
air
to
morley
the
florist
s
first
martin
she
told
the
chauffeur
as
they
drove
down
fifth
avenue
patty
nodded
to
acquaintances
now
and
then
she
was
very
happy
for
she
was
planning
a
pleasant
outing
for
her
club
of
working
girls
and
it
greatly
interested
her
she
had
long
ago
gotten
over
her
foolish
notion
about
the
stage
and
was
now
able
to
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
her
silly
idea
but
she
occasionally
sang
at
a
concert
for
charity
or
for
the
entertainment
of
her
friends
and
her
voice
by
reason
of
study
and
practice
was
growing
stronger
and
fuller
when
she
reached
morley
s
the
florist
s
doorman
assisted
patty
from
the
car
and
she
went
into
the
shop
though
she
had
threatened
to
reprove
him
severely
for
his
error
about
the
flowers
patty
was
really
very
polite
and
merely
called
his
attention
to
the
mistake
which
he
promised
to
rectify
at
once
then
selecting
a
small
bunch
of
violets
to
pin
on
her
coat
patty
went
out
the
doorman
who
had
been
looking
in
the
window
to
see
when
she
started
sprang
to
attention
and
then
as
patty
stepped
toward
her
car
she
stood
in
amazement
for
there
on
the
back
seat
sat
a
smiling
baby
a
chubby
child
about
two
years
old
why
you
cunning
kiddy
exclaimed
patty
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
what
are
you
doing
in
my
car
the
baby
smiled
at
her
and
holding
out
a
little
hand
said
f
owers
f
owers
for
middy
who
is
she
martin
asked
patty
of
the
chauffeur
how
did
she
get
here
martin
looked
around
the
car
was
a
long
one
and
he
had
not
turned
to
look
back
since
patty
went
into
the
shop
why
miss
patty
i
don
t
know
maybe
some
of
your
friends
left
her
no
of
course
no
one
would
do
that
and
besides
i
don
t
know
the
child
who
are
you
baby
middy
said
the
little
one
i
you
are
are
you
well
that
doesn
t
help
much
who
brought
you
here
middy
muddy
middy
your
vocabulary
seems
to
be
limited
well
what
shall
i
do
with
you
the
baby
gurgled
and
smiled
and
reiterated
a
demand
for
f
yes
you
may
have
the
flowers
and
patty
gave
her
the
violets
but
i
don
t
understand
your
presence
apparently
it
mattered
not
to
the
baby
what
patty
understood
and
she
smelled
the
flowers
with
decided
evidences
of
satisfaction
patty
turned
to
the
doorman
who
had
followed
her
from
the
shop
what
do
you
make
of
it
she
said
the
man
stared
i
don
t
know
ma
am
there
was
no
baby
in
the
car
when
you
arrived
that
there
was
not
agreed
patty
well
how
did
she
get
there
i
m
sure
i
ve
no
idea
ma
weren
t
you
here
while
i
was
in
the
store
yes
ma
am
but
i
was
looking
in
at
you
so
s
to
be
ready
to
open
your
car
door
as
soon
as
you
came
well
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
queer
i
wonder
what
i
d
better
shall
i
call
a
policeman
ma
am
policeman
gracious
no
this
is
a
nice
child
see
how
pretty
she
is
and
how
well
yes
ma
patty
looked
up
and
down
the
street
but
saw
no
one
whom
she
could
connect
with
the
baby
s
presence
a
policeman
drew
near
and
his
expression
was
questioning
he
hadn
t
realised
that
there
was
a
strange
baby
in
the
case
but
he
saw
the
lady
was
in
a
dilemma
of
some
sort
and
he
was
about
to
ask
why
but
patty
jumped
in
the
car
beside
the
child
and
said
home
martin
so
quickly
that
the
policeman
wandered
on
without
a
word
it
s
ridiculous
to
take
you
home
baby
patty
said
but
what
can
i
do
with
you
f
owers
said
the
little
voice
and
the
stranger
offered
them
to
patty
to
smell
yes
nice
flowers
returned
patty
absently
as
she
stared
hard
at
her
visitor
who
are
you
dear
middy
middy
and
the
little
face
dimpled
in
glee
well
middy
you
re
one
too
many
for
me
and
they
went
on
toward
home
oh
nan
cried
patty
as
she
took
her
new
friend
indoors
look
who
s
here
who
is
she
asked
nan
looking
up
from
her
book
as
patty
deposited
the
small
morsel
of
humanity
on
a
sofa
dunno
she
was
wished
on
me
while
i
was
in
at
morley
s
came
out
of
the
shop
to
find
her
sitting
bolt
upright
in
the
really
did
somebody
abandon
her
can
t
say
she
wasn
t
there
then
she
there
that
s
all
i
know
want
her
certainly
not
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
the
stranger
seemed
to
sense
a
lack
of
welcome
and
putting
up
a
pathetic
little
red
lip
said
in
tragic
tones
middy
ants
you
poor
little
thing
cried
patty
catching
her
up
in
her
arms
did
your
mother
put
you
there
ess
muddy
frowed
middy
in
au
mobile
middy
ant
do
where
is
your
home
the
baby
s
face
smiled
beatifically
but
the
midget
only
said
vere
don
t
you
know
yourself
and
the
baby
shook
her
head
it
s
clear
enough
patty
somebody
has
abandoned
the
little
thing
how
awful
and
such
a
pretty
baby
and
beautifully
dressed
look
nan
see
the
little
white
kid
shoes
and
fine
little
handkerchief
linen
frock
and
her
cap
is
all
and
her
coat
is
of
the
best
possible
quality
look
at
the
fineness
of
the
well
what
about
it
i
can
t
make
it
out
if
it
were
a
poor
child
i
d
think
it
a
case
of
abandonment
oh
patty
i
ll
tell
you
somebody
kidnapped
a
rich
child
and
then
they
became
frightened
and
slipped
her
into
your
car
to
save
themselves
from
why
of
course
that
s
it
how
clever
you
are
nan
to
think
it
out
for
she
is
a
refined
sweet
baby
not
a
bit
like
a
slum
this
was
true
the
dark
curls
that
clustered
on
the
baby
s
brow
were
fine
and
soft
her
little
hands
were
well
cared
for
and
her
raiment
was
immaculate
and
of
the
best
but
they
searched
in
vain
for
any
name
or
distinguishing
mark
on
her
clothes
even
the
coat
and
cap
had
no
maker
s
tag
in
them
though
it
was
evident
that
there
had
been
see
said
patty
they
ve
ripped
out
the
store
tag
the
kidnappers
did
that
did
the
bad
mans
take
you
baby
no
muddy
b
ing
baby
des
muddy
is
of
course
her
mother
now
we
know
her
mother
never
put
the
child
in
the
car
so
i
guess
we
can
t
depend
on
her
ess
and
the
little
one
grew
emphatic
muddy
did
b
ing
middy
an
muddy
put
middy
in
au
well
i
give
it
up
she
seems
to
know
what
she
s
talking
about
but
i
do
believe
she
was
kidnapped
we
ll
have
to
keep
her
for
a
day
or
two
it
ll
be
in
the
papers
of
perhaps
she
s
hungry
nan
what
ought
she
to
eat
anything
simple
ask
louise
for
some
milk
and
but
middy
did
not
seem
hungry
she
took
but
a
sip
of
the
milk
and
a
mere
nibble
of
the
cracker
she
seemed
happy
and
though
she
beamed
impartially
on
everybody
she
said
little
she
ought
to
have
something
to
play
with
decreed
patty
there
isn
t
a
thing
in
the
house
i
ransacked
the
attic
rooms
for
that
last
missionary
box
i
haven
t
any
favours
or
toys
left
nan
i
m
going
to
take
her
out
to
buy
some
and
maybe
we
ll
meet
her
distracted
mother
looking
for
maybe
you
won
t
but
go
along
if
you
like
i
ll
go
with
you
as
far
as
gordon
putting
on
the
baby
s
wraps
again
patty
started
off
the
child
was
delighted
to
go
in
the
car
nice
au
mobile
she
said
patting
the
cushions
hear
her
patronising
tone
laughed
nan
middy
have
au
mobile
at
home
she
inquired
no
no
was
the
reply
as
the
tiny
white
teeth
showed
in
a
sunny
smile
you
re
a
little
scamp
anyway
declared
patty
hugging
the
morsel
to
her
and
middy
crowed
in
contentment
patty
took
her
to
a
large
toyshop
as
they
entered
a
clerk
came
forward
to
wait
on
them
what
can
i
show
you
he
asked
wait
a
minute
said
patty
let
the
baby
choose
now
middy
what
do
you
like
best
the
child
looked
around
deliberately
then
spying
some
dolls
she
made
a
rush
for
them
middy
ant
ess
very
well
you
shall
have
a
this
one
or
this
one
no
reat
bid
one
see
she
pointed
to
the
largest
doll
of
all
a
very
magnificent
affair
indeed
oh
that
s
too
big
for
a
little
girl
like
middy
have
a
dear
little
cunning
baby
but
no
the
child
was
and
insisted
on
the
big
doll
well
said
patty
i
suppose
she
might
as
well
have
it
so
the
big
doll
was
put
into
the
outstretched
little
arms
and
peace
reigned
an
a
dolly
vadon
the
small
tyrant
went
on
this
was
translated
to
mean
dolly
wagon
by
the
clerk
who
was
more
versed
than
patty
in
baby
language
good
gracious
sister
you
ll
bankrupt
me
and
patty
inquired
the
price
of
the
little
coaches
moreover
the
wilful
purchaser
declined
all
but
the
best
and
biggest
and
when
it
was
ordered
sent
home
patty
hurried
her
charge
out
of
the
store
lest
she
demand
further
booty
with
the
big
doll
they
went
back
home
and
patty
set
herself
to
work
to
get
further
knowledge
of
the
child
s
antecedents
but
here
efforts
were
vain
she
learned
only
the
age
of
her
guest
and
no
other
statistics
mos
two
ears
old
middy
declared
she
was
but
except
for
that
no
information
was
forthcoming
inquiries
regarding
her
father
brought
only
blank
looks
haven
t
you
any
father
at
all
urged
patty
no
no
fader
poor
middy
dot
no
fader
but
the
bid
for
sympathy
was
so
clearly
insincere
and
the
accompanying
smile
so
merry
that
patty
concluded
she
had
no
father
of
her
recollection
it
soon
transpired
that
the
wily
mite
called
for
sympathy
on
all
occasions
poor
middy
was
her
constant
plea
if
she
wanted
anything
poor
middy
hung
y
she
said
at
last
and
this
time
she
eagerly
welcomed
the
milk
and
crackers
now
poor
middy
s
eepy
she
announced
when
her
meal
was
over
and
willingly
she
allowed
patty
to
bathe
her
hands
and
face
and
put
her
to
rest
on
the
couch
in
the
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
pretty
exclaimed
patty
to
nan
as
the
latter
returned
she
s
been
sleeping
nearly
two
hours
see
her
little
hand
just
like
a
crumpled
what
dad
say
they
let
the
baby
sit
up
until
fairfield
s
arrival
anxious
to
know
his
opinion
of
the
strange
circumstance
well
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
patty
what
queer
jinks
will
you
cut
up
next
but
dads
it
surely
wasn
t
my
fault
it
was
none
of
doing
of
course
not
child
i
expect
you
re
one
of
those
cut
out
for
queer
happenings
there
are
such
people
you
well
but
what
do
you
think
about
it
how
do
you
explain
it
do
you
think
as
nan
does
that
kidnappers
put
her
in
the
car
because
they
were
frightened
for
their
own
safety
if
found
with
the
little
thing
not
altogether
likely
i
think
it
s
more
probable
the
mother
abandoned
oh
how
could
she
that
angel
child
she
a
beauty
isn
t
she
daddy
very
pretty
very
pretty
indeed
but
a
problem
the
end
is
not
yet
pattykins
i
m
sorry
this
has
happened
there
s
been
no
kidnapping
if
there
had
it
would
have
been
in
the
papers
this
is
it
seems
to
me
a
deep
laid
plot
of
some
sort
well
we
must
await
patty
went
away
with
louise
to
make
the
baby
a
bed
for
the
night
in
her
own
with
pillows
and
some
guarding
chairs
they
improvised
a
crib
and
the
process
of
undressing
the
baby
proved
such
a
gala
time
that
the
whole
house
rang
with
merriment
as
they
took
off
one
little
white
shoe
a
folded
paper
dropped
out
it
was
addressed
to
patty
herself
with
a
feeling
of
apprehension
as
to
what
it
might
contain
she
ran
downstairs
with
it
before
she
looked
inside
at
all
chapter
xiii
chick
s
plan
here
s
a
note
said
patty
to
her
parents
it
was
in
the
baby
s
shoe
i
haven
t
read
it
open
it
fairfield
took
the
paper
patty
handed
him
and
read
aloud
miss
you
not
adopt
my
little
girl
i
am
a
woman
of
your
own
class
in
society
i
married
my
father
s
chauffeur
and
my
family
disowned
me
now
i
am
in
most
unfortunate
circumstances
but
i
have
tried
to
keep
my
baby
and
i
can
do
it
no
longer
and
though
it
breaks
my
heart
to
give
her
up
i
want
her
to
have
a
home
of
refinement
and
comfort
you
are
rich
and
you
are
devoted
to
charitable
work
will
you
not
keep
her
for
your
own
or
if
you
are
unwilling
to
do
this
will
you
not
find
a
good
kind
friend
who
will
take
her
her
name
is
millicent
but
i
call
her
milly
she
is
a
year
and
ten
months
old
and
she
has
a
lovely
disposition
do
not
attempt
to
seek
me
out
i
will
never
try
to
see
the
child
nor
will
i
make
trouble
in
any
way
about
the
adoption
please
keep
her
yourself
from
milly
s
mother
loves
custards
and
hates
oatmeal
well
said
patty
here
s
a
state
of
things
milly
must
think
i
m
anxious
to
start
an
orphan
asylum
the
kiddy
is
a
dear
i
m
not
sure
care
to
adopt
i
should
say
and
nan
looked
indignant
i
never
heard
of
such
nerve
now
now
broke
in
fairfield
the
poor
mother
is
not
so
much
to
be
blamed
i
feel
very
sorry
for
her
think
of
the
circumstances
she
married
the
chauffeur
away
with
him
likely
now
he
has
doubtless
deserted
her
or
worse
remained
with
her
and
treats
her
cruelly
poor
girl
it
s
only
natural
that
she
should
want
her
baby
to
grow
up
in
a
home
having
the
advantages
she
herself
enjoyed
if
i
were
you
i
d
try
to
find
a
good
home
for
the
little
waif
that
is
unless
you
wish
to
keep
her
no
replied
patty
thoughtfully
i
don
t
believe
i
do
you
can
t
take
a
baby
as
you
would
a
lapdog
there
is
a
responsibility
and
a
care
that
you
would
have
to
assume
and
i
m
sure
i
don
t
want
to
devote
the
better
part
of
my
existence
to
bringing
up
a
child
that
doesn
t
belong
to
of
course
you
don
t
agreed
nan
the
idea
is
absurd
but
the
question
is
who
would
take
her
i
can
t
think
of
anybody
declared
patty
wrinkling
her
brows
could
we
advertise
no
said
fairfield
that
wouldn
t
do
at
all
you
ll
have
to
keep
the
baby
for
a
little
while
and
ask
your
friends
if
they
know
of
a
possible
home
for
her
when
it
is
noised
around
i
m
sure
some
one
will
come
forward
to
want
and
meantime
daddy
you
can
look
after
her
i
m
planning
a
busy
winter
and
i
ve
no
time
for
stray
can
t
you
get
a
nurse
suggested
fairfield
oh
yes
and
nan
sighed
but
we
ve
as
many
servants
as
the
house
will
easily
accommodate
now
and
a
nurse
and
a
nursery
and
the
nurse
s
room
will
necessitate
rearranging
everything
it
s
no
joke
to
introduce
a
baby
member
into
a
household
i
can
tell
you
you
can
keep
my
for
a
nursery
offered
patty
i
can
get
along
without
it
for
a
it
isn
t
really
big
enough
objected
nan
the
child
must
have
lots
of
fresh
air
i
never
have
any
patience
with
those
idiot
people
who
say
why
do
women
waste
their
affection
on
dogs
why
not
adopt
a
dear
little
baby
it
s
a
very
different
proposition
i
can
tell
you
of
course
we
ll
have
to
have
a
nurse
if
the
child
stays
here
at
all
but
where
we
ll
put
her
don
t
well
said
patty
hopefully
perhaps
we
can
find
a
home
for
her
quickly
and
too
i
d
like
to
have
her
here
a
few
weeks
i
think
she
s
a
darling
plaything
but
i
don
t
want
to
keep
her
all
her
life
i
wonder
who
the
mother
is
do
you
suppose
she
knows
me
of
course
she
knows
of
you
said
her
father
your
name
is
often
in
the
papers
in
connection
with
various
charities
as
well
as
in
the
social
notes
she
chose
you
probably
as
being
too
to
shift
the
responsibility
of
the
and
i
am
i
ll
accept
the
responsibility
of
finding
milly
a
home
but
it
can
t
be
here
of
that
i
m
how
shall
you
go
about
it
asked
nan
looking
helpless
and
rather
hopeless
with
energy
and
promptness
returned
patty
and
the
promptness
begins
right
she
seated
herself
at
the
telephone
table
and
called
up
a
wealthy
and
childless
woman
of
her
acquaintance
oh
porter
she
began
i
ve
the
most
wonderful
opportunity
for
you
don
t
you
want
to
adopt
a
baby
girl
a
real
all
big
dark
eyes
and
curly
hair
and
the
sweetest
little
hands
and
feet
oh
thank
you
no
replied
the
amused
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
it
is
indeed
a
chance
of
a
thousand
i
am
sure
but
we
re
going
south
for
the
winter
and
we
shall
be
bobbing
about
with
no
settled
abode
for
a
baby
where
did
you
get
the
paragon
i
have
it
on
trial
and
i
want
to
dispose
of
it
advantageously
don
t
you
know
of
any
one
who
might
take
her
let
me
see
i
believe
bishop
did
say
something
about
some
friend
of
hers
who
knew
of
somebody
who
was
about
to
take
a
child
from
an
orphan
asylum
but
i
remember
now
she
especially
wanted
a
oh
but
brunettes
are
so
much
nicer
i
m
a
blonde
myself
and
it
s
awfully
monotonous
do
tell
me
the
name
of
the
friend
s
friend
whoever
it
i
don
t
know
really
it
was
about
a
month
ago
i
heard
of
it
but
bishop
can
tell
you
warrington
i
don
t
know
her
said
patty
may
i
use
your
name
as
an
introduction
certainly
and
if
i
can
think
up
anybody
else
i
ll
let
you
that
was
but
the
first
of
a
hundred
similar
conversations
that
patty
held
she
used
the
telephone
as
it
meant
far
less
time
wasted
than
personal
visits
would
consume
and
she
hoped
each
call
would
bring
indirect
results
if
not
immediate
success
but
everybody
was
too
engrossed
in
society
or
philanthropy
or
some
hobby
or
travelling
about
to
consider
for
a
moment
the
acquisition
of
a
new
charge
two
or
three
times
there
was
a
glimmer
of
a
hope
of
success
and
patty
would
go
flying
off
to
call
on
a
possible
client
but
always
it
proved
a
vain
chimera
one
lady
wanted
a
baby
to
adopt
but
would
only
take
a
boy
another
was
most
desirous
of
an
infant
but
it
must
be
not
more
than
six
weeks
old
another
had
intended
adopting
a
child
but
had
suddenly
turned
to
settlement
work
instead
the
days
went
by
and
patty
became
almost
disheartened
nan
and
her
father
tried
to
help
her
but
they
too
met
with
no
success
fairfield
spoke
to
several
business
friends
of
his
but
they
either
laughed
at
him
or
politely
expressed
their
lack
of
interest
in
the
matter
a
nurse
had
been
engaged
a
skilled
and
capable
trained
nurse
for
patty
argued
that
if
they
wanted
to
find
a
good
home
for
milly
they
must
keep
her
in
the
pink
of
condition
but
though
the
nurse
was
most
efficient
she
was
dictatorial
and
and
her
superior
air
offended
the
other
servants
and
caused
housekeeper
nan
no
end
of
trouble
they
thought
of
changing
the
nurse
but
miss
swift
took
such
good
care
of
her
charge
that
they
continued
to
keep
her
the
small
cause
of
all
the
excitement
went
on
her
way
unknowing
what
turmoil
she
had
stirred
up
middy
lub
patty
she
would
say
toddling
to
patty
s
side
as
she
sat
at
her
everlasting
telephone
conversations
middy
fink
patty
booful
yes
and
patty
finks
middy
is
booful
catching
the
baby
up
in
her
arms
but
you
are
a
terrible
responsibility
fot
is
tebble
spombilty
well
it
s
what
you
are
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
you
lub
me
suggested
milly
twining
her
chubby
arms
around
patty
s
neck
till
she
nearly
choked
her
tell
me
i
s
your
pressus
yes
you
re
all
of
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
m
getting
too
fond
of
you
you
little
fat
rascal
i
must
beg
of
you
miss
fairfield
not
to
caress
the
child
so
much
said
the
cold
voice
of
nurse
swift
it
is
conceded
by
all
authorities
that
kissing
is
most
fudge
said
patty
i
m
only
kissing
the
back
of
her
neck
microbes
don
t
hurt
back
there
do
they
doodlums
and
she
cuddled
the
baby
again
while
miss
swift
looked
on
in
high
dudgeon
of
course
she
said
primly
if
my
advice
based
on
experience
and
knowledge
is
not
to
be
considered
at
all
it
might
be
well
if
you
employed
some
there
there
nurse
interrupted
patty
we
re
not
going
to
employ
anybody
else
take
the
and
put
her
in
a
glass
case
then
she
won
t
get
kissed
and
cuddled
by
bad
naughty
ignorant
pattys
no
no
middy
tay
wiv
patty
middy
not
go
wiv
bad
nursie
listen
dearie
girl
go
away
with
nursie
now
and
get
nice
bread
and
milk
and
come
back
to
see
patty
some
nother
this
reasoning
worked
well
and
the
baby
went
off
smiling
and
throwing
kisses
back
to
patty
oh
me
oh
my
sighed
patty
what
can
i
do
what
i
do
that
evening
chick
channing
called
to
him
patty
narrated
her
difficulties
don
t
you
know
of
anybody
who
wants
a
perfectly
angel
child
she
said
truly
there
never
was
such
a
little
ray
of
sunshine
such
a
sweet
disposition
and
intelligent
but
channing
didn
t
know
of
a
single
applicant
for
such
a
treasure
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
said
let
s
peddle
her
tomorrow
i
ll
come
for
you
in
my
runabout
and
you
have
the
kiddy
all
dolled
up
fine
and
we
ll
take
her
round
from
house
to
house
and
offer
her
to
the
highest
there
won
t
be
any
bidders
said
patty
disconsolately
oh
i
don
t
know
we
can
exploit
her
and
her
appearance
will
be
all
to
the
good
anyway
we
can
try
it
and
it
ll
give
the
poor
little
scrap
an
outing
if
nothing
more
and
give
her
overworked
nurse
a
chance
for
an
hour
so
patty
agreed
and
the
next
afternoon
chick
came
for
them
the
baby
looked
a
dream
in
her
white
coat
and
hat
her
clustering
curls
showing
a
glimpse
of
pink
where
first
asked
chick
as
they
started
off
in
gay
spirits
mercy
don
t
know
returned
patty
i
thought
you
were
running
this
scheme
and
that
you
had
places
in
not
i
but
if
you
haven
t
either
i
suggest
we
just
stop
hit
or
miss
at
any
house
that
looks
nonsense
we
can
t
do
well
then
let
s
take
her
to
an
orphan
asylum
or
children
s
home
and
just
leave
her
no
indeed
and
patty
clasped
milly
close
she
shan
t
go
to
any
such
place
why
they
mightn
t
be
kind
to
her
probably
not
but
what
then
oh
dear
i
don
t
know
what
good
are
you
chick
if
you
can
t
suggest
something
i
m
worn
out
pondering
on
the
well
if
it
s
as
bad
as
that
i
invent
something
let
me
see
oh
by
the
way
are
you
going
to
the
meredith
tea
this
afternoon
i
meant
to
go
till
you
trumped
up
this
plan
which
if
you
ll
excuse
me
is
the
biggest
chase
i
ever
saw
not
unless
you
re
the
wild
goose
i
assure
you
i
m
not
and
to
prove
it
here
s
a
plan
let
s
go
to
the
tea
and
take
this
little
exhibit
there
will
be
hundreds
of
people
there
and
you
can
auction
her
off
easily
chick
what
a
crazy
idea
it
would
never
do
why
not
well
first
meredith
would
be
highly
indignant
at
such
a
not
she
you
know
very
well
patty
she
s
a
climber
and
she
s
most
anxious
to
know
you
better
and
count
you
as
her
friend
oh
i
know
all
this
inside
information
i
do
so
if
you
do
something
a
bit
eccentric
perhaps
but
pretty
and
effective
it
will
give
her
tea
a
certain
prestige
a
unique
interest
that
will
tickle
her
to
patty
considered
it
might
work
she
said
thinking
hard
but
i
ll
have
to
go
back
and
so
shall
i
but
the
belle
of
the
ball
here
is
all
right
isn
t
she
yes
or
ll
put
on
her
very
bestest
frock
all
lace
and
frills
well
turn
back
home
then
and
come
for
us
again
at
five
it
s
milly
s
at
six
but
no
matter
if
we
provide
her
a
home
and
a
at
five
then
chick
returned
and
found
a
resplendent
pair
awaiting
him
patty
wore
one
of
her
prettiest
afternoon
frocks
of
dolly
varden
silk
and
milly
was
in
gossamer
linen
and
laces
hidden
beneath
her
white
cloth
coat
she
was
in
effervescent
spirits
and
babbled
continuously
in
her
merry
little
way
at
the
house
the
maid
in
the
stared
hard
at
the
baby
but
said
no
word
as
she
drew
off
the
little
coat
sleeves
patty
looked
milly
over
critically
perked
up
her
enormous
pink
and
shook
out
her
frills
then
they
went
to
the
meeting
chick
at
the
door
i
feel
a
mad
desire
to
giggle
he
said
as
he
caught
sight
of
patty
and
milly
toddling
beside
her
i
feel
a
mad
desire
to
run
away
she
returned
stand
by
me
la
mort
he
replied
and
they
entered
the
reception
how
do
you
do
meredith
said
patty
in
her
most
dulcet
tones
i
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
a
little
friend
of
mine
though
she
wasn
t
invited
i
feel
sure
you
can
spare
her
a
little
bit
of
your
welcome
and
meredith
a
young
woman
of
great
dignity
looked
at
milly
in
astonishment
as
patty
had
carefully
taught
her
the
midget
dropped
a
dainty
courtesy
and
smiled
up
in
her
hostess
face
remembering
the
great
desirability
of
patty
s
friendship
meredith
retained
her
composure
and
laughed
you
dear
girl
how
original
you
are
who
else
would
have
thought
of
bringing
a
baby
to
my
reception
is
she
a
relative
of
yours
not
that
said
patty
smiling
but
a
very
dear
and
then
channing
stepped
up
to
greet
meredith
and
others
quickly
followed
so
that
our
trio
could
drift
away
into
the
crowd
of
chatting
laughing
people
what
shall
we
do
with
middy
said
patty
anxiously
the
little
thing
will
be
smothered
down
there
among
all
those
full
skirts
and
floating
sashes
for
already
the
tiny
mite
was
entangling
her
little
fingers
in
the
fringed
ends
of
a
lady
s
scarf
i
ll
take
her
and
chick
leaned
down
and
picking
up
middy
seated
her
on
his
broad
shoulder
it
made
a
bit
of
a
sensation
for
channing
s
towering
height
made
him
always
a
conspicuous
figure
and
the
laughing
baby
attracted
every
one
s
attention
now
s
your
chance
he
whispered
suddenly
everybody
is
looking
at
us
step
up
on
this
chair
and
auction
her
off
i
you
to
chapter
xiv
a
great
success
patty
always
declared
afterward
that
chick
hypnotised
her
and
that
she
would
have
done
it
had
she
been
in
her
right
mind
but
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
carried
away
with
the
spirit
of
the
thing
knowing
that
it
was
then
or
never
and
taunted
by
the
patty
stepped
up
on
the
low
chair
and
said
people
dear
before
she
realised
what
she
was
about
then
like
a
flash
an
acute
realisation
of
what
she
had
done
came
over
her
followed
with
swiftness
by
the
knowledge
that
she
go
on
to
go
on
was
the
only
possible
justification
for
having
gone
so
far
so
go
on
she
did
dear
people
listen
a
minute
this
is
unconventional
and
all
that
i
know
just
hark
here
is
a
little
girl
a
beautiful
and
child
for
somebody
s
adoption
who
wants
her
surely
among
all
of
you
there
is
some
who
could
love
this
dear
baby
enough
to
give
her
a
home
look
at
her
is
she
not
charming
and
as
bright
and
affectionate
as
she
is
pretty
kiss
your
hand
to
the
people
milly
always
obeyed
the
slightest
wish
of
her
beloved
patty
and
with
the
most
adorable
smiles
and
coy
glances
from
her
big
dark
eyes
she
blew
kisses
from
her
tiny
fingertips
now
love
chick
went
on
patty
shaking
in
her
shoes
lest
this
might
try
channing
s
endurance
beyond
its
limit
but
he
was
game
and
when
milly
s
dimpled
arms
went
round
his
neck
and
she
laid
her
soft
cheek
against
his
hair
and
crooned
a
few
little
love
notes
the
audience
applauded
with
delight
you
see
went
on
patty
this
baby
is
homeless
i
want
to
give
her
to
a
kind
wise
and
loving
woman
no
others
need
apply
i
will
say
no
more
now
but
any
one
who
is
interested
may
speak
to
me
about
it
either
here
and
now
or
at
my
home
i
will
tell
all
particulars
to
any
one
who
wants
the
baby
and
will
be
the
right
mother
for
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
patty
made
a
deprecating
little
bow
and
stepped
down
from
the
low
chair
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
milly
s
high
thin
little
voice
piped
out
me
fink
patty
booful
this
disarmed
criticism
and
everybody
laughed
while
a
ripple
of
applause
floated
through
the
room
and
then
half
a
dozen
of
the
ladies
moved
toward
the
end
of
the
room
where
patty
and
milly
were
they
were
followed
by
others
for
all
wanted
to
see
more
closely
the
interesting
mite
and
the
unusual
circumstance
roused
curiosity
even
among
those
who
had
no
thought
of
taking
the
child
but
it
seemed
several
did
want
her
or
at
least
wanted
to
investigate
the
matter
channing
by
patty
s
side
helped
to
answer
questions
he
was
an
invaluable
aid
for
his
quick
wit
and
pleasant
personality
made
for
a
clear
understanding
of
the
case
nonsense
fanning
he
said
to
a
gay
young
matron
you
don
t
want
another
olive
branch
you
ve
five
at
home
now
i
know
it
but
this
is
such
a
heavenly
baby
and
my
youngest
is
eight
i
d
love
to
have
this
cherub
though
i
don
t
know
what
fanning
would
now
you
musn
t
be
greedy
said
chick
smiling
be
content
with
your
own
little
brood
and
let
somebody
take
milly
who
really
needs
an
angel
in
the
milly
did
not
become
frightened
at
the
amount
of
curious
attention
she
received
but
serene
and
sweet
smiled
happily
at
all
and
cuddled
close
to
patty
it
was
not
difficult
to
discover
who
was
really
in
earnest
among
the
inquirers
some
were
charmed
by
the
baby
s
attractions
but
had
no
thought
of
taking
her
to
keep
others
looked
at
her
wistfully
but
for
one
reason
or
another
were
unable
to
adopt
her
but
there
were
three
who
were
positive
of
their
desire
for
the
child
and
each
of
the
three
was
determined
to
have
her
i
offered
first
argued
chaffee
a
haughty
dame
whose
dark
eyes
blazed
angrily
as
she
noted
patty
s
indifference
to
her
claim
i
wish
to
have
the
child
and
i
can
give
her
every
so
can
i
said
miss
penrose
a
delightful
spinster
who
wanted
an
heir
to
her
fortune
and
a
pet
to
lavish
her
affection
upon
i
want
her
very
much
i
can
devote
all
my
time
and
attention
to
her
she
shall
have
the
best
of
education
and
training
and
my
wealth
shall
all
be
patty
considered
miss
penrose
was
of
aristocratic
family
and
her
prestige
was
undeniable
she
would
give
all
care
and
study
to
a
most
careful
correct
bringing
up
of
the
baby
and
milly
s
future
would
be
assured
but
and
patty
did
not
herself
realise
at
first
why
she
objected
to
miss
penrose
until
it
suddenly
dawned
on
her
that
it
was
because
the
lady
had
no
sense
of
humour
patty
was
sure
she
would
take
the
upbringing
of
milly
so
seriously
that
the
sunny
baby
would
become
a
little
automaton
this
was
instinctive
on
patty
s
part
for
she
knew
miss
penrose
only
slightly
but
the
earnestness
of
the
lady
was
very
apparent
smilingly
holding
the
question
in
abeyance
patty
listened
to
the
plea
of
the
third
applicant
this
was
colton
a
young
widow
two
years
before
a
motor
accident
had
snatched
from
her
her
husband
and
baby
girl
and
had
left
her
for
a
time
hovering
between
life
and
death
only
of
late
had
she
listened
to
her
friends
urging
to
go
among
people
once
more
and
this
tea
was
almost
her
first
appearance
in
society
since
her
tragic
affliction
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
said
to
patty
i
have
the
baby
she
is
not
unlike
my
little
gladys
and
she
would
be
to
me
a
veritable
godsend
i
have
thought
often
of
adopting
a
child
and
this
is
the
one
i
want
i
love
her
already
will
you
come
to
me
milly
milly
eyed
her
for
a
moment
the
two
looked
at
each
other
intently
there
was
a
breathless
pause
and
all
who
were
near
felt
the
dramatic
intensity
of
the
moment
colton
smiled
and
it
may
have
been
that
milly
read
in
that
smile
all
the
and
longing
for
she
dropped
patty
s
hand
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
lady
little
arms
outstretched
reaching
her
she
threw
her
arms
about
her
neck
exclaiming
i
fink
you
s
booful
this
phrase
was
her
highest
praise
and
as
colton
s
arms
closed
round
the
child
no
one
could
doubt
that
these
two
hearts
were
forever
united
i
hope
you
take
her
colton
said
patty
earnestly
you
are
made
for
each
indeed
i
will
take
her
if
i
may
in
fact
i
can
not
let
her
go
and
the
eyes
full
of
affection
gazed
at
the
little
cherub
but
want
her
declared
chaffee
i
asked
for
her
first
and
i
think
it
most
i
m
not
auctioning
the
baby
chaffee
said
patty
smiling
at
the
determined
lady
it
isn
t
a
question
of
who
asked
first
milly
and
colton
are
too
perfectly
suited
to
each
other
to
let
me
even
consider
any
other
mother
for
the
child
please
give
up
all
thought
of
it
for
i
have
made
up
my
miss
penrose
was
more
acquiescent
and
nonchalantly
presumed
she
could
get
an
equally
pretty
baby
from
an
asylum
to
which
patty
heartily
agreed
it
was
arranged
that
patty
should
take
milly
home
with
her
for
a
few
days
till
colton
could
prepare
for
her
reception
also
she
promised
to
call
in
her
lawyer
and
see
about
the
legal
processes
of
adoption
in
this
most
unusual
case
all
unwitting
of
the
plans
for
her
destiny
milly
beamed
impartially
on
everybody
and
went
with
patty
to
make
adieux
to
the
hostess
i
do
apologise
said
patty
smiling
for
this
eccentric
performance
but
when
you
know
me
better
dear
meredith
you
will
expect
strange
happenings
when
i
m
about
all
my
friends
know
the
speech
was
a
clever
one
for
meredith
greatly
desired
to
be
classed
among
the
friends
of
patty
fairfield
the
society
belle
it
was
charming
of
you
she
returned
to
choose
my
for
your
pretty
project
i
trust
you
will
always
feel
free
to
avail
yourself
of
any
opportunity
i
can
milly
made
her
dear
little
curtsey
channing
murmured
polite
phrases
and
they
went
away
well
said
chick
as
they
whirled
along
homeward
we
came
we
saw
and
you
bet
we
conquered
how
about
it
i
should
say
we
did
and
patty
s
face
glowed
with
satisfaction
and
happiness
there
s
nobody
i
d
rather
give
milly
to
than
colton
she
s
a
perfect
dear
and
her
great
sorrow
has
left
her
with
an
aching
hungry
heart
that
this
little
scrap
of
happiness
can
you
were
a
brick
patty
i
didn
t
think
you
d
dare
do
i
couldn
t
have
if
i
d
stopped
to
think
but
you
dared
i
never
could
refuse
a
dare
then
i
claim
some
of
the
credit
of
the
success
of
our
all
of
it
chick
i
never
should
have
dreamed
of
such
an
unheard
of
performance
what
nan
say
let
s
go
in
and
see
may
i
come
in
yes
do
i
want
you
to
back
me
up
if
they
jump
on
but
they
didn
t
though
nan
and
fairfield
were
utterly
astounded
at
the
story
they
heard
they
had
only
praise
for
the
result
the
very
one
declared
nan
mrs
colton
is
a
lovely
woman
and
her
wealth
and
education
and
refined
tastes
will
insure
milly
exactly
the
right
kind
of
a
home
for
life
oh
patty
it
s
fine
but
what
meredith
think
oh
said
patty
airily
as
it
was
the
illustrious
me
she
was
overjoyed
to
have
her
house
turned
into
an
auction
room
she
would
have
been
equally
delighted
if
i
d
made
a
bear
garden
of
you
conceited
little
rascal
said
her
father
shocked
at
this
no
it
wasn
t
idea
you
all
know
overweening
modesty
but
chick
here
said
that
the
parvenu
element
in
the
lady
s
soul
would
be
kindly
disposed
toward
let
us
say
toward
the
daughter
of
frederick
this
turning
of
the
tables
made
them
all
laugh
but
channing
said
it
s
quite
true
i
know
the
meredith
type
and
i
was
sure
that
to
be
made
conspicuous
by
an
acknowledged
social
power
like
our
patty
would
be
unction
to
her
well
it
was
a
crazy
piece
of
business
said
fairfield
but
as
it
turned
out
so
admirably
we
can
t
complain
it
is
right
down
splendid
to
get
the
little
one
taken
by
such
a
fine
woman
as
colton
i
m
sure
it
will
be
a
most
successful
arrangement
and
we
owe
you
a
vote
of
thanks
channing
for
bringing
it
oh
i
m
only
accessory
before
the
fact
patty
did
it
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
when
she
mounted
that
chair
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
her
expression
concealed
beneath
a
society
smile
was
a
whole
show
i
don
t
care
i
accomplished
my
purpose
and
patty
beamed
with
satisfaction
but
it
was
mostly
because
chick
dared
me
let
us
hope
i
ll
always
be
present
at
any
crisis
in
your
life
to
dare
you
said
channing
it
s
an
easy
way
to
achieve
great
when
patty
s
friends
heard
of
her
episode
they
bombarded
her
with
telephone
messages
and
notes
and
calls
concerning
it
some
chaffed
her
and
others
praised
but
all
were
agog
over
the
matter
even
van
reypen
telephoned
to
know
if
the
report
she
had
heard
were
true
what
did
you
hear
asked
patty
that
you
went
to
a
tea
and
auctioned
off
a
no
that
isn
t
quite
the
true
version
of
what
happened
now
i
ll
tell
no
don
t
i
can
t
bear
to
talk
over
the
telephone
come
and
see
me
and
bring
that
child
along
i
want
to
see
van
reypen
s
wish
was
usually
looked
upon
as
a
command
and
the
next
afternoon
patty
started
off
with
milly
to
call
on
her
elderly
friend
what
a
baby
oh
a
baby
was
the
greeting
the
child
received
for
van
reypen
was
most
enthusiastic
why
didn
t
you
keep
her
yourself
how
can
you
let
her
go
i
never
saw
such
a
lovely
baby
she
is
agreed
patty
smiling
as
milly
curtsied
to
van
reypen
over
and
over
again
but
i
couldn
t
keep
her
i
don
t
want
the
care
and
responsibility
of
a
kiddy
would
you
have
liked
to
take
her
i
believe
i
would
if
you
had
offered
me
the
chance
but
no
i
am
too
old
to
train
a
baby
now
do
you
know
though
patty
the
care
of
orphan
children
has
always
appealed
to
me
as
one
of
the
best
of
philanthropies
i
sometimes
think
even
yet
i
will
start
a
home
for
such
little
waifs
i
mean
a
real
homelike
sort
of
a
place
the
institution
usually
founded
for
such
a
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
lady
van
go
ahead
and
do
it
i
will
help
you
if
i
would
you
patty
would
you
give
of
your
time
and
interest
to
help
establish
the
thing
and
be
one
of
the
workers
for
it
yes
i
would
i
don
t
want
the
entire
responsibility
of
little
milly
but
i
am
glad
i
ve
found
a
good
home
for
her
and
if
there
are
other
similar
little
unfortunates
and
of
course
there
are
i
d
be
more
than
willing
to
help
you
in
a
project
to
make
them
happy
and
cared
well
i
ll
remember
that
and
i
think
i
ll
set
about
planning
for
it
i
m
getting
older
all
the
time
and
what
i
do
ought
to
be
begun
soon
patty
you
are
very
dear
to
me
know
that
it
s
kind
of
you
to
say
so
lady
van
and
i
do
appreciate
and
greatly
value
your
affection
for
me
i
wish
i
could
do
something
to
show
my
love
in
return
and
if
you
decide
to
go
into
this
scheme
of
yours
call
on
me
for
any
help
i
can
thank
you
dear
but
patty
there
is
another
way
in
which
you
could
greatly
please
me
i
think
you
patty
did
know
what
was
coming
but
she
affected
ignorance
most
any
way
lady
van
i
m
glad
to
please
you
but
i
think
this
orfling
home
plan
the
most
feasible
and
practicable
when
shall
us
begin
but
i
m
not
thinking
of
that
just
now
patty
you
dear
girl
t
you
bring
yourself
to
care
for
philip
oh
i
do
care
for
phil
i
care
for
him
a
lot
we
re
the
greatest
chums
he
ll
help
us
with
the
new
scheme
won
t
he
but
i
mean
to
care
for
him
especially
the
way
he
cares
for
now
dear
lady
van
let
s
not
discuss
that
today
i
m
so
busy
getting
this
matter
of
milly
fixed
up
i
can
t
turn
to
other
topics
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
nice
for
me
to
get
a
sort
of
wardrobe
together
for
her
before
she
goes
to
colton
s
no
i
think
it
would
be
ridiculous
colton
has
plenty
of
means
and
she
has
taste
and
knows
what
is
right
and
proper
for
the
child
far
better
than
you
do
give
the
baby
a
parting
gift
if
you
ll
give
her
one
myself
i
ll
give
her
a
silver
porringer
she
s
most
too
big
for
a
porringer
but
she
can
keep
it
for
an
heirloom
the
one
i
mean
to
give
her
is
an
old
dutch
one
of
real
value
but
patty
as
to
not
now
please
lady
van
dear
and
patty
put
her
fingers
to
her
ears
well
some
other
time
then
but
patty
if
you
could
learn
to
care
for
my
boy
i
d
make
you
my
oh
fie
fie
lady
van
you
re
trying
to
buy
my
young
affections
now
you
mustn
t
do
that
and
too
don
t
you
know
that
the
best
way
to
make
me
dislike
phil
is
to
continually
urge
him
upon
van
reypen
looked
a
little
taken
aback
at
this
and
immediately
dropped
the
subject
for
which
patty
was
devoutly
thankful
she
did
like
philip
but
she
did
not
want
his
aunt
arranging
affairs
for
her
for
patty
was
an
independent
nature
and
especially
so
where
her
plans
for
her
own
future
were
concerned
so
she
gladly
turned
the
conversation
back
to
the
matter
of
the
children
s
home
and
soon
realised
that
van
reypen
was
greatly
in
earnest
about
it
and
that
it
might
soon
become
a
reality
chapter
xv
patty
s
future
one
day
patty
was
at
a
matinée
with
some
of
the
girls
when
van
reypen
called
at
the
fairfield
home
it
being
saturday
afternoon
fairfield
was
at
home
and
the
visitor
asked
to
see
him
as
well
as
his
wife
after
greetings
were
exchanged
the
old
lady
went
at
once
to
her
subject
i
ve
come
to
see
you
about
patty
she
began
and
if
you
choose
to
tell
me
i
m
a
meddlesome
old
woman
and
concerning
myself
with
what
is
none
of
my
business
you
will
be
quite
within
your
i
doubt
we
shall
do
that
van
reypen
said
fred
fairfield
pleasantly
what
is
it
about
patty
only
this
to
put
it
in
plain
words
i
want
her
to
marry
my
nephew
i
should
make
no
objections
to
that
indeed
i
should
be
glad
and
proud
to
have
my
daughter
become
the
wife
of
your
nephew
he
is
a
fine
man
i
feel
that
i
know
him
well
and
there
is
no
one
to
whom
i
would
rather
entrust
patty
s
thank
you
fairfield
phil
a
good
boy
and
i
have
yet
to
learn
a
mean
or
ignoble
thing
about
him
what
is
your
opinion
fairfield
i
quite
agree
with
my
husband
returned
nan
philip
has
always
been
one
of
my
favourites
among
patty
s
friends
and
i
too
should
hear
of
their
engagement
with
pleasure
but
van
reypen
we
can
not
answer
for
patty
herself
she
is
as
you
perhaps
know
a
young
person
and
not
to
be
driven
or
even
advised
against
her
but
that
s
just
it
patty
doesn
t
know
her
own
will
she
takes
for
granted
all
the
attentions
and
favours
of
the
young
men
and
goodness
knows
she
gets
enough
of
them
but
it
never
seems
to
occur
to
her
that
it
s
time
she
thought
about
making
a
choice
of
one
in
oh
come
now
van
reypen
patty
is
not
yet
climbing
up
on
the
traditional
i
know
that
fairfield
but
the
point
is
that
she
is
and
and
while
she
is
i
desire
to
influence
her
mind
toward
philip
yes
just
that
it
is
not
wrong
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
wise
thing
to
do
in
france
the
girls
betrothals
are
always
arranged
by
their
elders
in
england
they
frequently
are
and
there
is
no
reason
the
plan
shouldn
t
obtain
in
our
country
we
all
have
patty
s
best
interests
at
heart
and
if
we
can
help
this
thing
along
letting
the
child
know
it
of
course
is
our
duty
as
well
as
our
pleasure
to
do
but
how
van
reypen
asked
nan
patty
would
quickly
resent
any
interference
or
dictation
in
her
affairs
and
too
any
hint
that
we
were
helping
philip
s
cause
along
would
i
assure
you
react
disastrously
to
our
oh
certainly
if
she
it
and
van
reypen
spoke
impatiently
but
she
needn
t
know
how
then
shall
it
be
done
in
lots
of
ways
let
us
throw
them
together
whenever
possible
see
to
it
that
she
accepts
his
invitations
here
and
there
place
them
next
each
other
at
dinners
in
a
word
make
it
clear
to
the
other
members
of
their
circle
that
they
are
definitely
each
other
and
it
will
shortly
be
recognized
and
accepted
as
a
fact
i
will
give
opera
parties
and
dinner
parties
and
i
will
see
to
it
that
they
are
conspicuously
paired
as
that
sounds
plausible
van
reypen
and
nan
shook
her
head
but
it
is
not
so
easy
you
of
course
see
them
together
often
but
patty
goes
to
many
parties
where
philip
is
not
invited
or
if
he
there
where
she
is
escorted
by
some
one
that
s
just
it
and
the
old
lady
s
tone
was
vibrant
with
enthusiasm
we
must
see
to
it
that
she
is
invited
everywhere
first
by
philip
and
then
she
can
t
accept
these
other
nan
smiled
at
the
thought
of
thus
ordering
headstrong
patty
s
engagement
calendar
but
she
only
said
i
m
sure
if
you
can
accomplish
this
i
shall
be
but
too
glad
for
i
too
want
to
see
patty
happily
married
i
am
in
no
haste
for
the
event
to
occur
but
i
would
like
to
rest
assured
that
her
choice
will
be
a
wise
one
and
one
that
will
mean
her
lifelong
all
that
would
be
insured
by
her
betrothal
to
philip
and
philip
s
aunt
looked
complacent
and
i
am
sure
the
dear
girl
would
be
willing
to
say
yes
to
him
if
she
were
convinced
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
make
a
choice
will
you
not
both
of
you
do
all
you
can
to
bring
this
about
with
pleasure
said
fairfield
but
as
my
wife
says
it
is
not
easy
to
force
or
coerce
my
oh
not
force
or
coerce
have
you
people
no
idea
of
diplomacy
of
strategy
even
if
necessary
just
how
may
diplomacy
be
directly
employed
principally
perhaps
by
inducing
propinquity
the
more
they
are
together
the
more
they
will
care
for
one
another
though
to
be
sure
philip
is
deeply
in
love
with
patty
now
he
has
i
am
sure
asked
her
to
marry
him
then
if
he
has
and
she
has
refused
him
said
nan
what
more
can
we
do
refused
him
nothing
of
the
sort
she
hasn
t
accepted
him
of
course
or
we
would
know
of
it
but
you
know
how
girls
nowadays
play
fast
and
loose
with
a
man
if
they
are
sure
of
his
devotion
indeed
if
philip
could
be
persuaded
to
slight
patty
a
little
now
and
then
it
would
soon
pique
her
into
an
acceptance
but
he
will
never
do
that
know
him
too
well
philip
is
a
dear
boy
but
a
straightforward
nature
with
no
thought
of
trifling
or
deception
no
we
must
devote
our
efforts
toward
patty
s
attitude
not
philip
s
he
is
all
right
as
he
is
if
patty
will
consent
to
marry
my
nephew
i
am
considering
making
her
my
mrs
van
reypen
fred
fairfield
exclaimed
in
indignation
i
beg
you
will
not
use
any
such
argument
or
bribe
in
connection
with
my
daughter
s
name
now
don
t
get
excited
tis
no
bribe
tis
but
the
fact
if
so
be
that
patty
will
become
my
niece
i
shall
divide
my
wealth
equally
between
her
and
my
nephew
she
shall
have
half
in
her
own
right
if
she
will
not
half
is
still
philip
s
and
the
other
half
will
go
to
a
charity
i
don
t
want
to
give
it
all
to
philip
he
is
already
a
rich
man
and
i
don
t
approve
of
too
big
fortunes
for
young
never
mind
about
the
money
part
of
it
said
nan
i
am
quite
willing
to
espouse
van
reypen
s
cause
irrespective
of
her
will
and
too
if
patty
does
marry
philip
it
is
quite
right
and
proper
that
she
should
inherit
this
wealth
if
not
there
is
no
question
of
her
having
it
so
the
fortune
element
settles
itself
but
what
i
can
t
see
is
how
we
re
going
about
this
thing
i
m
somewhat
practical
van
reypen
and
i
confess
i
can
see
no
practical
way
to
bring
these
two
hearts
to
beat
as
one
if
you
can
instruct
me
i
shall
be
glad
to
obey
nan
looked
very
pretty
and
sweet
as
she
spoke
in
earnest
on
the
subject
she
meant
just
what
she
said
she
would
be
very
glad
to
have
patty
marry
philip
very
glad
to
do
anything
she
could
to
help
bring
it
about
but
for
the
life
of
her
she
couldn
t
see
anything
to
do
well
van
reypen
defended
her
stand
when
i
took
them
on
that
motor
trip
together
with
me
that
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
they
were
thrown
so
much
in
one
another
s
company
that
it
became
inevitable
to
them
to
be
together
i
always
thought
if
that
farnsworth
hadn
t
joined
us
up
at
lake
sunapee
the
matter
would
have
been
settled
then
and
you
think
farnsworth
interfered
asked
nan
i
m
not
sure
do
you
think
patty
cares
for
him
no
i
think
not
said
fred
fairfield
they
seem
to
have
little
tiffs
when
they
re
together
and
i
doubt
they
are
very
i
used
to
like
bill
farnsworth
said
nan
but
since
i
learned
that
he
tried
to
bring
about
patty
s
going
on
the
stage
i
ve
not
cared
so
much
for
him
you
see
he
s
a
westerner
and
he
has
different
ideas
from
ours
imagine
patty
on
the
stage
and
it
was
unpardonable
in
him
to
put
the
idea
in
her
did
he
do
that
yes
philip
said
he
heard
that
farnsworth
took
patty
over
to
the
hotel
where
that
actress
was
staying
to
talk
the
matter
over
and
he
says
that
patty
herself
said
that
bill
said
she
was
enough
to
go
on
the
stage
fancy
it
s
an
outrage
that
whole
stage
business
makes
my
blood
boil
and
van
reypen
s
very
bonnet
strings
shook
in
righteous
indignation
that
s
what
you
get
for
letting
her
associate
with
a
man
like
oh
come
now
said
fairfield
farnsworth
is
a
good
sort
i
think
he
s
very
much
of
a
a
fine
type
of
a
man
to
try
to
get
a
nice
girl
like
patty
to
become
a
common
actress
the
aristocratic
visitor
s
face
expressed
the
deepest
scorn
of
the
theatrical
profession
as
a
whole
but
she
s
all
over
that
isn
t
she
yes
thank
goodness
answered
nan
well
all
i
can
see
to
do
is
to
incline
patty
toward
philip
in
any
subtle
way
we
can
praise
him
to
her
judiciously
not
too
much
compare
him
favourably
with
other
men
especially
farnsworth
for
i
m
not
sure
that
patty
doesn
t
like
him
quite
a
little
then
let
philip
come
here
often
and
we
will
make
him
very
welcome
and
the
rest
i
think
he
will
have
to
accomplish
you
have
expressed
it
very
well
fairfield
and
the
visitor
rose
to
go
and
i
m
sure
other
ways
and
means
will
suggest
themselves
to
you
as
time
goes
on
if
you
would
sometimes
ask
him
to
dinner
quite
i
will
do
the
same
by
patty
such
things
them
be
alone
together
of
an
evening
now
and
then
do
and
so
the
plans
were
made
and
the
schemers
who
were
all
actuated
by
an
honest
desire
for
patty
s
happiness
began
to
watch
for
opportunities
as
van
reypen
had
surmised
in
her
wise
canny
mind
there
were
ways
unobtrusive
and
delicate
by
which
the
two
young
people
could
be
thrown
together
more
frequently
and
none
of
these
was
neglected
nothing
insistent
or
noticeable
was
ever
attempted
but
after
a
time
patty
found
herself
relying
on
philip
s
advice
and
judgment
and
unconsciously
referring
questions
to
him
for
settlement
van
reypen
and
the
elder
fairfields
noted
this
approvingly
and
the
whole
circle
of
young
people
came
gradually
to
look
on
philip
as
patty
s
special
property
van
reypen
was
by
no
means
averse
to
this
and
he
adopted
an
attitude
of
ownership
which
as
it
became
definite
was
quickly
resented
by
patty
look
here
phil
she
said
one
day
you
needn
t
act
as
if
i
belonged
to
you
don
t
decide
things
for
me
without
my
forgive
me
patty
i
ve
no
wish
to
offend
but
you
will
belong
to
me
some
day
and
i
suppose
i
m
too
impatient
for
the
day
to
how
do
you
know
i
will
it
s
written
in
the
stars
we
were
made
for
each
other
you
ll
wake
up
to
the
fact
some
day
perhaps
i
ha
e
me
doots
said
patty
in
roguish
mood
and
her
light
laughter
checked
the
more
serious
words
that
rose
to
philip
s
lips
he
was
content
to
bide
his
time
one
day
he
telephoned
to
patty
that
van
reypen
was
not
well
and
begged
she
would
come
over
is
she
ill
asked
patty
in
surprise
for
the
hale
old
lady
was
a
valetudinarian
not
quite
that
but
she
has
a
cold
and
she
wants
cheering
so
patty
ordered
the
car
and
went
right
over
she
found
that
van
reypen
did
indeed
have
a
cold
and
a
severe
one
patty
was
alarmed
and
insisted
on
calling
the
doctor
who
pronounced
it
a
case
of
grip
and
ordered
the
patient
to
bed
patty
remained
over
night
for
van
reypen
was
feverish
and
too
nervous
and
worried
about
herself
to
be
left
to
the
care
of
servants
late
in
the
evening
however
she
became
quieter
and
begged
patty
to
leave
her
to
herself
for
a
time
and
go
downstairs
and
sit
with
philip
and
cheer
up
the
poor
boy
so
having
made
the
sick
lady
as
comfortable
as
she
could
patty
ran
downstairs
for
a
while
she
was
garbed
in
a
boudoir
robe
of
van
reypen
s
she
had
discarded
her
street
gown
as
being
out
of
place
in
the
sick
room
and
had
rummaged
in
her
hostess
wardrobe
until
she
selected
one
of
the
many
house
gowns
and
negligées
that
hung
there
it
was
utterly
inappropriate
for
the
girl
being
made
of
purple
silk
with
a
wide
berthé
of
duchess
lace
but
it
made
patty
look
very
quaint
and
sweet
a
maid
of
olden
time
she
had
twisted
her
curls
up
high
and
added
a
large
carved
ivory
comb
from
the
dressing
table
the
puritan
maiden
priscilla
she
had
said
laughingly
as
she
pirouetted
before
her
hostess
a
very
fetching
garb
remarked
the
old
lady
you
may
have
it
to
keep
you
can
use
it
in
your
amateur
theatricals
or
such
dressings
up
and
the
berthé
is
of
valuable
old
patty
thanked
her
kind
friend
but
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
so
accustomed
to
receiving
gifts
from
van
reypen
that
one
more
was
but
as
a
drop
in
the
bucket
so
on
being
dismissed
from
the
sick
room
patty
ran
lightly
downstairs
and
into
the
library
only
a
shaded
table
light
was
turned
on
and
in
the
glow
of
the
firelight
philip
sat
in
an
easy
chair
smoking
when
he
heard
patty
enter
he
threw
his
cigar
in
the
fire
and
holding
out
his
arm
he
drew
her
down
to
the
broad
tufted
arm
of
the
great
chair
he
sat
in
how
goes
it
upstairs
he
asked
casually
not
very
well
said
patty
soberly
i
don
t
want
to
be
a
calamity
howler
but
i
think
lady
van
is
more
ill
than
she
knows
this
grip
is
a
treacherous
thing
and
liable
to
take
sudden
turns
for
the
worse
and
too
she
is
not
as
young
as
she
once
was
and
so
philip
i
want
you
to
take
all
precautions
i
will
look
after
her
tonight
but
tomorrow
you
must
get
a
of
course
i
will
send
for
one
now
if
you
say
no
i
can
manage
for
tonight
she
is
resting
quietly
now
she
is
bright
and
cheery
you
understand
but
she
is
weak
and
the
disease
has
a
strong
hold
on
patty
what
a
dear
girl
you
are
philip
spoke
in
a
fine
honest
manly
way
and
patty
thrilled
at
his
so
sincere
praise
you
are
one
in
a
thousand
indeed
i
m
sure
there
never
was
another
like
go
way
wid
yer
blarney
laughed
patty
a
least
bit
embarrassed
because
she
knew
it
was
not
mere
blarney
it
s
the
truth
dear
and
you
know
it
oh
patty
wouldn
t
it
be
nice
if
you
lived
here
all
the
time
so
i
could
take
care
of
lady
van
and
her
light
laugh
rang
out
yes
and
so
you
could
take
care
of
me
i
need
taking
care
of
is
i
need
you
to
take
care
of
why
philip
you
re
the
most
capable
person
i
know
you
can
take
care
of
well
then
i
wish
you
lived
here
so
i
could
take
care
of
you
would
you
like
that
you
little
colonial
dame
i
m
pretty
independent
i
m
not
sure
i
d
take
kindly
to
being
taken
care
you
would
like
the
way
take
care
of
you
i
promise
you
that
why
how
would
it
be
patty
knew
she
was
playing
with
fire
she
knew
that
unless
she
meant
to
encourage
philip
van
reypen
she
ought
not
to
lead
him
on
in
this
way
but
patty
was
very
feminine
and
the
temptation
to
know
just
what
he
meant
was
very
strong
well
philip
laid
his
warm
hand
gently
on
hers
in
the
first
place
you
should
never
know
a
care
or
a
trouble
that
i
could
bear
for
h
m
said
patty
that
s
comforting
but
not
so
very
you
little
witch
do
you
want
entertainment
well
then
i
d
make
it
my
life
work
to
invent
new
entertainments
for
you
every
day
how
s
that
that
s
better
and
naughty
patty
showed
animated
delight
at
the
prospect
what
would
the
entertainments
be
like
that
s
telling
they
d
be
surprises
and
i
can
t
divulge
their
secrets
till
you
do
come
to
live
here
i
did
live
here
once
said
patty
smiling
at
the
recollection
as
lady
van
s
and
now
won
t
you
come
and
live
here
as
my
companion
oh
are
you
getting
old
enough
to
need
a
companion
i
sure
am
i
m
and
that
s
the
very
exact
age
when
a
man
wants
a
companion
or
at
any
rate
this
man
does
will
you
patty
precious
i
dunno
tell
me
more
about
these
well
they
should
comprise
all
the
best
ones
that
are
to
be
found
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
when
you
tired
of
them
i
would
make
up
new
parties
yes
parties
of
every
sort
dances
theatre
parties
motor
parties
dinner
parties
and
little
twosy
parties
you
and
me
all
alone
patty
you
witch
do
you
want
to
drive
me
crazy
now
just
for
that
you
ve
got
to
say
yes
and
live
here
with
me
and
have
all
the
little
twosy
parties
you
want
but
philip
proposed
them
you
didn
t
and
patty
pouted
until
her
scarlet
lips
looked
like
a
cleft
cherry
because
i
didn
t
dare
do
you
suppose
i
let
myself
think
that
you
would
care
for
such
well
i
don
t
know
as
i
do
i
ve
never
tried
them
and
patty
ran
out
of
the
room
chapter
xvi
the
promise
on
returning
to
van
reypen
s
room
patty
found
that
lady
sleeping
quietly
so
she
herself
went
to
bed
on
a
couch
in
the
adjoining
next
morning
the
patient
was
weak
and
ill
and
when
the
doctor
arrived
he
sent
at
once
for
two
nurses
patty
went
home
feeling
sad
for
she
feared
her
kind
old
friend
might
not
survive
this
illness
but
nan
cheered
her
up
saying
that
while
grip
was
sometimes
a
serious
matter
more
often
it
was
light
and
of
short
duration
but
it
is
contagious
nan
went
on
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
catch
it
patty
don
t
go
over
there
again
until
van
reypen
gets
patty
agreed
to
this
but
a
few
days
later
there
came
such
an
imperative
summons
from
van
reypen
that
patty
felt
she
must
respond
to
the
call
well
don
t
go
very
near
her
begged
nan
as
patty
started
you
are
susceptible
to
colds
and
if
you
get
grip
it
will
wear
you
reaching
the
house
patty
was
shocked
at
the
appearance
of
van
reypen
she
was
emaciated
and
her
face
had
a
waxen
pallor
but
her
dark
eyes
were
feverishly
bright
and
she
greeted
patty
with
an
eager
smile
then
she
sent
the
nurse
from
the
room
with
peremptory
orders
not
to
return
until
called
patty
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
old
lady
began
all
right
lady
van
said
patty
lightly
but
you
musn
t
talk
much
if
it
s
an
important
subject
you
d
better
wait
till
you
are
i
shall
never
be
stronger
my
dear
this
is
my
last
illness
oh
now
don
t
talk
like
that
grip
always
makes
its
patients
discouraged
but
you
are
too
sensible
to
be
fooled
by
it
brace
up
and
resolve
to
get
well
and
then
you
will
get
patty
was
arguing
against
her
own
convictions
for
she
saw
the
ravages
the
disease
had
made
and
she
feared
the
worst
but
she
did
all
she
could
to
cheer
and
encourage
it
s
useless
for
you
to
talk
like
that
the
invalid
went
on
for
i
know
what
i
know
now
listen
to
me
i
am
going
to
die
i
know
it
and
i
am
not
afraid
i
am
seventy
years
old
i
have
had
a
happy
life
and
if
my
time
has
come
i
am
willing
to
die
life
is
sweet
but
we
must
all
die
and
it
is
only
a
coward
who
fears
death
i
am
going
to
leave
you
a
fortune
patty
i
have
made
my
will
and
in
it
i
bequeath
you
a
hundred
thousand
oh
lady
van
patty
gasped
don
t
leave
me
all
that
money
i
should
be
overcome
with
the
responsibility
of
nonsense
but
listen
to
the
plan
i
want
you
to
have
half
of
it
absolutely
for
yourself
and
the
other
half
use
to
build
a
children
s
home
i
know
you
will
enjoy
doing
this
and
i
trust
you
to
do
it
well
thus
you
see
your
own
share
of
the
money
is
in
a
way
payment
for
your
work
and
responsibility
of
the
home
you
may
build
rent
or
buy
a
house
for
the
purpose
your
father
and
philip
will
help
you
as
to
the
business
matters
but
the
furnishing
and
house
planning
will
be
your
work
will
you
do
this
i
d
love
to
do
it
and
patty
s
eyes
shone
at
the
idea
if
i
am
of
course
you
re
capable
not
a
big
home
you
understand
but
as
large
as
the
money
will
properly
pay
for
then
have
it
bright
and
pretty
and
if
it
only
accommodates
a
dozen
children
i
don
t
care
i
know
this
is
your
favourite
form
of
philanthropy
and
it
is
also
mine
i
wish
we
could
have
done
it
together
but
it
is
too
late
for
that
now
but
philip
will
help
you
and
if
more
money
is
necessary
he
will
give
it
to
you
from
his
own
inheritance
phil
is
a
rich
man
but
i
shall
leave
him
all
my
fortune
except
what
i
give
you
so
don
t
hesitate
to
ask
him
if
you
need
more
all
right
but
i
shall
put
your
whole
bequest
into
the
scheme
i
don
t
want
to
be
paid
for
doing
what
will
be
a
great
don
t
be
a
little
simpleton
you
will
take
your
own
half
for
your
individual
use
and
not
a
cent
of
it
is
to
go
toward
the
home
there
is
money
enough
for
that
and
it
isn
t
payment
i
give
it
to
you
because
i
am
really
very
fond
of
you
you
have
made
sunshine
in
my
life
ever
since
i
first
found
you
and
i
am
glad
to
give
you
a
small
fortune
when
you
marry
as
you
will
some
day
you
will
find
it
very
nice
to
be
able
to
buy
what
you
want
for
your
trousseau
you
can
buy
jewels
with
it
or
if
you
prefer
put
it
out
at
interest
and
have
a
stated
income
but
accept
it
you
must
or
i
shall
think
you
don
t
love
me
at
oh
yes
i
do
dear
lady
van
you
know
i
then
don
t
upset
my
last
hours
by
refusing
what
i
patty
almost
laughed
at
the
snappish
tone
so
incongruous
in
one
who
was
making
a
splendid
gift
but
van
reypen
was
getting
more
and
more
excited
a
red
spot
burned
in
either
cheek
and
her
eyes
blazed
as
she
gesticulated
from
her
pillows
and
there
s
another
thing
patty
fairfield
that
you
are
to
do
for
me
you
are
to
marry
my
boy
well
and
patty
laughed
lightly
we
won
t
discuss
that
but
we
will
discuss
it
now
i
want
your
promise
do
you
suppose
i
got
you
over
here
just
to
tell
you
about
my
will
no
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
grant
me
this
happiness
before
i
die
philip
loves
you
deeply
he
wants
you
for
his
wife
and
he

told
you

could
you
find
a
better
man

more
honourable
a
kinder
a
more
generous
and
loving
heart
and
he
worships
you
he
would
always
be
gentle
and
tender
with
you
he
is
of
fine
old
stock
there
is
no
better
family
tree
in
the
country
than
the
van
reypens
now

you
give
me
your
promise
oh
lady
van
i
can
t
promise
offhand

that
tell
me

for
philip
don
t
you
yes

t
think
i
love
him
as
i
ought
i
want
to
love
the
man
i
fiddlesticks
you
don
t
know
your
own
mind
that

all
you
re
a
foolish
sentimental
child
now
look
here

marry
philip
soon
you
ll
find
out
that
you
do
love
him
why
who
could
help
it
he
s
such
a
splendid
fellow
he
would
make
you
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
patty
he
s
a
man
of
a
thousand
he
hasn
t
a
bad
trait
or
an
unworthy
thought
in
his
mind
you
don
t
know
how
really
fine
he
is
and
he
adores
you
so
would
give
you
every
wish
of
your
i
know
he
would
he
has
told
me
so
but
i
can
t
feel
sure
that
i
care
for
him
in
the
right
way
and
i
can
t
you
mean
you
won
t
you
are
willing
to
trifle
with
philip
s
affections
and
lead
him
on
and
lure
him
with
false
hopes
and
stop
stop
that
s
not
fair
i
never
led
him
on
we
have
been
good
friends
for
years
but
i
never
even
imagined
his
wanting
to
marry
me
until
he
told
me
so
last
last
summer
and
you
haven
t
given
him
a
definite
answer
yet
you
keep
him
on
without
the
least
consideration
or
care
as
to
his
feelings
if
he
were
not
such
a
patient
man
he
would
have
given
up
all
idea
of
wanting
you
do
you
know
what
you
are
patty
fairfield
you
re
a
little
flirt
that
s
what
you
are
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
how
many
other
men
have
you
on
a
string
several
i
dare
lady
van
you
have
no
right
to
talk
to
me
like
this
if
you
were
not
ill
i
d
be
very
angry
with
you
but
as
you
are
i
ascribe
your
harsh
speeches
to
the
illness
that
is
racking
you
now
let
us
drop
the
subject
and
talk
of
something
we
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
sent
for
you
to
get
your
promise
and
i
m
going
to
get
it
van
reypen
sat
upright
in
her
bed
and
shook
her
clenched
hand
at
patty
you
little
fool
she
cried
any
girl
in
her
senses
would
be
only
too
glad
to
get
such
a
man
as
my
nephew
you
are
honoured
by
his
wanting
you
i
am
very
fond
of
you
myself
are
so
pretty
and
but
if
you
refuse
me
this
wish
of
my
heart
i
shall
cease
to
love
you
i
won
t
leave
you
that
money
the
old
lady
s
voice
rose
nearly
to
a
shriek
and
she
glared
at
patty
with
a
fairly
malevolent
gaze
that
last
speech
was
too
much
for
patty
i
don
t
want
your
money
she
said
rising
to
go
i
can
not
stay
and
listen
to
such
unjust
remarks
as
you
have
been
making
i
m
sorry
but
i
can
t
give
you
the
promise
you
ask
and
as
i
can
t
please
you
i
think
i
d
better
sit
down
begged
van
reypen
and
now
her
anger
was
gone
and
her
tones
were
wheedlesome
forgive
me
dear
i
have
no
right
to
force
your
will
but
please
patty
girl
think
it
over
here
and
now
you
can
easily
learn
to
love
phil
re
not
in
love
with
anybody
else
are
you
no
replied
patty
then
as
i
say
you
can
easily
learn
to
love
him
he
is
such
a
dear
and
he
would
treat
you
like
a
princess
he
would
shower
you
with
gifts
and
pleasures
you
could
live
in
this
house
or
he
would
buy
you
or
build
you
whatever
home
you
fancied
then
together
you
could
carry
out
my
project
for
the
children
s
home
your
life
would
be
a
heaven
on
earth
don
t
you
think
so
patty
patty
when
lady
van
chose
she
could
be
very
sweet
and
ingratiating
and
she
seemed
to
hypnotize
patty
the
girl
looked
at
her
with
a
hesitating
expression
say
yes
pleaded
the
old
lady
please
patty
say
yes
you
ll
never
regret
it
and
you
will
be
happy
all
your
life
and
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
eased
the
last
hours
of
a
dying
woman
and
sent
her
out
of
the
world
happy
and
contented
to
go
for
i
am
dying
patty
you
do
not
know
all
of
my
ills
i
may
live
a
few
days
but
not
longer
the
doctor
knows
and
so
do
the
nurses
i
haven
t
told
philip
for
i
hate
to
cause
him
pain
but
if
i
can
tell
him
of
your
promise
to
marry
him
it
will
mitigate
his
grief
at
saying
farewell
to
me
now
you
will
say
yes
won
t
you
my
dear
little
patty
girl
no
buts
now
you
couldn
t
have
the
heart
to
refuse
the
dying
request
of
one
who
has
always
loved
you
like
a
daughter
i
would
gladly
have
adopted
you
patty
had
your
people
been
willing
to
spare
you
i
went
to
see
your
parents
not
long
ago
your
father
said
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
he
would
rather
see
you
marry
than
philip
and
nan
said
the
same
why
do
you
fight
against
it
so
is
it
merely
shyness
just
maidenly
reserve
if
that
s
it
i
understand
and
appreciate
but
waive
all
that
for
my
time
is
short
you
needn
t
marry
him
at
once
if
you
don
t
wish
but
promise
me
that
he
shall
be
your
choice
that
he
will
be
the
man
you
will
some
day
wed
and
make
happy
won
t
you
promise
patty
yes
you
can
van
reypen
leaned
out
of
her
bed
and
grasped
patty
s
arm
in
a
clutch
you
can
and
you
shall
now
once
promise
the
black
eyes
of
the
old
lady
bored
into
patty
s
own
her
firm
hard
mouth
was
set
in
a
straight
line
and
with
both
hands
she
gripped
patty
s
arms
and
shook
her
slightly
promise
or
i
shall
die
on
the
spot
i
promise
said
patty
faintly
urged
on
by
the
older
woman
s
force
of
intensity
of
will
van
reypen
fell
back
exhausted
she
seemed
unconscious
but
whether
in
a
faint
or
stunned
by
sudden
reaction
patty
did
not
know
she
flew
to
the
door
and
called
the
nurse
goodness
what
happened
inquired
miss
french
has
she
had
any
sort
of
mental
shock
she
has
given
me
one
returned
patty
but
the
nurse
was
busy
administering
restoratives
and
paid
no
heed
patty
went
slowly
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
she
walked
home
in
a
daze
what
had
she
done
for
to
patty
a
promise
was
a
sacred
thing
and
not
to
be
broken
she
hoped
van
reypen
would
get
better
and
she
would
go
and
ask
to
be
released
from
a
promise
that
was
fairly
wrung
from
her
she
was
undecided
whether
to
tell
nan
about
it
or
not
but
concluded
to
wait
a
day
or
two
first
and
then
she
thought
to
herself
why
wasn
t
she
prepared
to
fulfill
the
promise
why
didn
t
she
want
to
marry
phil
big
phil
who
loved
her
so
deeply
at
times
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
did
want
to
marry
him
and
then
again
she
wasn
t
sure
i
ll
sleep
over
it
she
thought
and
by
tomorrow
i
ll
know
my
own
mind
better
i
must
be
a
very
thing
anyhow
why
don
t
i
know
what
i
want
but
i
suppose
every
girl
feels
like
this
when
she
tries
to
make
up
her
mind
philip
is
a
dear
that
s
certain
maybe
i
m
worrying
too
much
over
it
well
i
ll
see
by
but
the
next
day
and
the
next
patty
was
equally
uncertain
as
to
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
that
she
had
made
that
promise
and
after
another
day
or
two
she
went
down
herself
with
the
grip
i
told
you
you
d
catch
it
from
van
reypen
scolded
nan
you
had
no
business
to
go
there
and
expose
but
i
had
to
go
when
she
sent
for
me
said
patty
what
did
she
want
of
you
you
never
told
well
for
one
thing
she
thinks
she
s
going
to
die
and
she
wants
to
leave
me
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
her
a
hundred
thousand
patty
you
must
be
well
it
isn
t
all
for
me
only
and
then
patty
told
about
the
plan
for
the
children
s
home
but
she
said
nothing
about
the
promise
she
had
given
nan
was
greatly
excited
over
the
bequest
but
she
said
i
don
t
believe
van
is
going
to
die
she
s
better
today
i
just
i
hope
she
won
t
die
said
patty
fervently
i
don
t
want
her
money
and
if
she
gets
well
she
can
run
that
home
project
herself
and
i
ll
willingly
help
oh
nan
i
do
feel
grip
has
the
reputation
of
making
people
feel
horrid
the
doctor
came
and
sent
patty
to
bed
and
for
several
days
she
had
a
high
fever
which
was
aggravated
by
her
mental
worry
over
the
promise
she
had
made
to
van
reypen
chapter
xvii
the
crisis
and
then
the
day
came
when
the
doctor
said
patty
had
pneumonia
rooms
were
darkened
nurses
went
around
silently
nan
wandered
about
unable
to
concentrate
her
mind
on
anything
and
fairfield
spent
much
of
his
time
at
home
the
telephone
was
continually
ringing
as
one
friend
after
another
asked
how
patty
was
and
the
rooms
downstairs
were
filled
with
the
gifts
of
flowers
that
the
patient
might
not
even
see
what
word
doctor
asked
mona
galbraith
as
the
physician
came
downstairs
one
morning
the
girls
came
and
went
as
they
chose
always
some
one
or
more
of
them
were
sitting
in
the
library
or
anxiously
awaiting
news
i
think
i
can
say
she
s
holding
her
own
replied
the
doctor
guardedly
if
she
had
a
stronger
constitution
i
should
feel
decidedly
hopeful
but
she
is
a
frail
little
body
and
we
must
be
very
very
he
hurried
away
and
mona
turned
back
to
where
elise
sat
i
know
she
ll
die
wailed
elise
i
just
patty
will
die
oh
it
seems
a
shame
i
can
t
it
and
she
broke
down
in
a
tumult
of
sobbing
don
t
elise
begged
mona
why
not
hope
for
the
best
patty
isn
t
strong
she
s
a
healthy
little
piece
and
that
doctor
is
a
calamity
howler
anyway
everybody
says
i
know
it
but
somehow
i
have
a
presentiment
patty
never
will
get
presentiments
are
silly
things
they
don
t
mean
a
thing
i
d
rather
have
hope
than
all
the
presentiments
in
the
world
here
comes
knowing
his
sister
and
his
fiancée
were
there
roger
came
in
they
told
him
what
the
doctor
had
said
brace
up
girls
he
said
cheeringly
the
game
s
never
out
till
it
s
played
out
i
believe
our
spunky
little
patty
will
outwit
the
old
pneumonia
and
get
the
better
of
it
she
always
comes
out
top
of
the
heap
somehow
and
her
holding
on
so
long
is
a
good
sign
don
t
you
want
to
go
home
now
mona
you
look
all
tired
yes
do
go
mona
said
elise
kindly
but
it
isn
t
tiredness
roger
it
s
anxiety
go
on
you
two
i
ll
stay
a
while
the
pair
went
and
elise
sat
alone
in
the
library
presently
through
the
stilled
house
she
heard
patty
s
voice
ring
out
high
and
shrill
i
don
t
it
patty
cried
i
don
t
the
fortune
and
i
don
t
want
to
marry
why
do
they
make
me
to
marry
everybody
in
the
whole
world
the
voice
was
that
of
delirium
though
not
really
delirious
patty
s
mind
was
flighty
and
the
sentences
that
followed
were
disjointed
and
incoherent
but
they
all
referred
to
a
fortune
or
to
a
marriage
what
can
she
mean
sobbed
nan
who
with
her
husband
sat
in
an
adjoining
room
never
mind
dear
it
s
her
feverish
disordered
imagination
talking
if
she
were
herself
she
wouldn
t
know
what
those
words
meant
perhaps
it
is
better
that
her
mind
wanders
some
say
that
s
a
good
sign
keep
up
hope
nan
darling
if
only
for
my
yes
fred
and
we
have
cause
for
hope
doctor
is
by
no
means
discouraged
and
if
we
can
tide
over
another
we
we
will
something
tells
me
patty
will
get
well
the
clear
look
in
her
eyes
this
were
they
clear
nan
did
they
seem
so
to
you
yes
dear
they
did
and
the
nurse
said
that
meant
a
but
the
specialist
said
patty
is
so
so
she
is
and
always
has
been
but
that
s
in
her
favour
it
s
often
the
strong
robust
people
that
go
off
quickest
with
pneumonia
patty
has
a
wiry
nervous
strength
that
is
a
help
to
her
you
re
such
a
comfort
nan
but
i
don
t
want
patty
to
nor
i
fred
she
is
nearly
as
dear
to
me
as
to
you
you
know
that
i
m
sure
and
patty
is
a
born
fighter
she
s
like
you
in
that
i
know
she
ll
battle
with
that
disease
and
conquer
it
she
will
please
god
you
re
right
dearest
let
us
hope
it
with
all
our
alone
patty
fought
her
life
and
death
battle
doctors
nurses
friends
all
did
what
they
could
but
alone
she
grappled
with
the
angel
of
death
all
unconsciously
too
but
with
an
involuntary
struggle
for
life
against
the
grim
foe
that
held
her
now
and
again
her
voice
cried
out
in
delirium
or
murmured
in
a
babbling
monotone
now
racked
with
fever
now
shivering
with
a
chill
the
tortured
little
body
shook
convulsively
or
lay
in
a
stupor
once
when
kit
cameron
was
downstairs
they
heard
patty
shriek
out
about
the
fortune
oh
said
kit
awestruck
can
she
mean
that
business
we
had
don
t
you
remember
i
told
her
she
d
inherit
a
fortune
of
course
i
was
only
joking
always
predict
a
legacy
i
hope
hasn
t
worried
no
said
nan
shaking
her
head
it
isn
t
that
she
s
been
worrying
about
that
fortune
ever
since
she
s
been
flighty
i
know
what
she
means
never
mind
glad
that
it
was
not
an
unfortunate
result
of
his
practical
joke
kit
dropped
the
subject
i
want
her
to
get
well
so
terribly
he
went
on
i
just
have
it
otherwise
i
ve
always
cherished
a
sort
of
forlorn
hope
that
i
could
win
her
yet
do
you
think
i
ve
a
chance
nan
when
we
get
her
well
again
we
ll
see
and
nan
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
but
it
s
awfully
nice
of
you
boys
to
come
round
so
often
you
cheer
us
up
a
good
deal
fairfield
is
not
very
hopeful
you
see
patty
s
mother
died
so
young
and
patty
is
very
like
her
delicate
fragile
though
almost
never
really
and
here
comes
another
of
my
nan
always
called
patty
s
friends
her
boys
and
they
all
liked
the
pleasant
lively
young
matron
and
affectionately
called
her
nan
this
time
it
was
chick
channing
and
he
came
to
inquire
after
patty
and
also
to
bring
the
sad
news
that
van
reypen
was
dead
though
not
entirely
unexpected
for
the
old
lady
had
been
very
ill
it
was
a
shock
and
cast
a
deeper
gloom
over
the
household
i
m
so
sorry
for
philip
said
nan
he
was
devoted
to
his
aunt
and
she
idolised
him
of
late
he
practically
made
his
home
with
i
suppose
he
is
her
heir
observed
channing
i
suppose
so
returned
nan
listlessly
and
then
she
suddenly
remembered
what
patty
had
said
about
van
s
bequest
to
her
but
she
decided
to
make
no
mention
of
it
at
present
she
was
a
wealthy
old
lady
said
cameron
van
reypen
will
be
well
fixed
he
s
a
good
man
i
like
i
don
t
know
him
well
said
chick
i
met
him
a
few
times
a
thorough
aristocrat
i
should
all
of
that
they
re
among
the
oldest
of
the
knickerbockers
but
nothing
of
the
snob
about
him
a
right
down
good
fellow
and
a
loyal
friend
well
i
must
go
command
me
nan
if
i
can
do
the
least
thing
for
our
patty
girl
keep
up
a
good
heart
kit
s
voice
choked
and
he
went
off
without
further
words
channing
soon
followed
but
all
day
the
young
people
kept
calling
or
telephoning
for
patty
had
hosts
of
friends
and
they
all
loved
her
nan
went
to
her
room
to
write
a
note
of
sympathy
to
philip
her
own
heart
full
of
sorrow
and
anxiety
she
felt
deeply
for
the
young
man
whose
home
death
had
invaded
and
her
kindred
trouble
helped
her
to
choose
the
right
words
of
comfort
and
cheer
the
day
of
van
reypen
s
funeral
patty
was
very
low
indeed
doctor
and
nurses
held
their
breath
as
their
patient
hovered
on
the
borderland
of
the
valley
of
shadow
and
patty
s
father
with
nan
sobbing
in
his
arms
awaited
the
dread
verdict
or
the
word
of
glorious
hope
patty
stirred
restlessly
her
breathing
laboured
and
difficult
she
said
in
very
low
but
clear
tones
but
i
didn
i
didn
didn
her
voice
trailed
away
to
silence
what
that
promise
whispered
the
doctor
to
nan
it
s
been
troubling
i
don
t
know
at
all
she
usually
tells
me
her
troubles
but
i
don
t
know
what
this
there
was
a
slight
commotion
below
stairs
the
doctor
looked
at
a
nurse
and
she
moved
noiselessly
out
to
command
quiet
patty
s
eyes
opened
wide
they
looked
very
blue
and
their
glance
was
more
nearly
rational
than
it
had
been
sh
she
said
weakly
listen
it
yes
it
tell
him
to
come
up
i
want
to
see
who
is
it
asked
the
doctor
she
mustn
t
see
i
must
whimpered
patty
beginning
to
cry
it
s
little
billee
i
want
him
for
heaven
s
sake
she
s
rational
exclaimed
the
doctor
bring
him
up
whoever
he
is
if
she
says
so
no
matter
if
it
s
an
elephant
bring
him
at
once
half
frightened
nan
went
out
into
the
hall
sure
enough
big
bill
farnsworth
was
halfway
upstairs
i
heard
her
he
said
in
a
choked
voice
she
said
she
wanted
come
said
nan
and
led
the
way
softly
farnsworth
stepped
inside
the
door
gently
as
a
woman
he
took
patty
s
thin
little
hand
in
his
two
big
strong
ones
as
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
her
bed
little
billee
and
patty
smiled
faintly
i
want
somebody
to
strong
m
so
yes
dear
and
firmly
holding
her
hand
in
one
of
his
farnsworth
softly
touched
her
eyelids
with
his
fingertips
and
the
white
lids
fell
over
the
blue
eyes
and
with
a
contented
little
sigh
patty
sank
into
a
natural
sleep
the
first
in
many
days
released
from
his
nervous
tension
the
doctor
s
set
features
relaxed
he
looked
in
gratified
amazement
at
the
sleeping
girl
and
at
the
two
astonished
nurses
she
will
live
he
said
softly
but
it
is
like
a
miracle
on
no
account
let
her
be
awakened
but
you
may
move
sir
she
is
in
a
sound
sleep
of
farnsworth
rose
down
patty
s
hand
lightly
as
a
snowflake
soundlessly
left
the
room
nan
and
fairfield
followed
after
a
moment
they
found
the
big
fellow
looking
out
of
the
hall
window
at
their
footsteps
he
turned
making
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
was
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
i
didn
t
he
said
brokenly
until
yesterday
i
was
in
chicago
made
the
best
connections
i
could
and
raced
up
here
have
right
now
yes
and
fred
fairfield
grasped
farnsworth
s
hand
undoubtedly
you
saved
her
life
it
was
the
crisis
if
she
could
said
she
is
thank
god
and
the
honest
blue
eyes
of
the
big
westerner
filled
again
with
tears
thank
too
cried
nan
and
she
shook
his
hand
with
fervour
come
into
my
and
tell
me
all
about
it
how
did
patty
know
you
were
here
didn
t
you
tell
her
bill
looked
amazed
no
she
must
have
heard
your
but
i
scarcely
spoke
above
my
breath
she
heard
it
divined
your
presence
somehow
for
she
said
you
were
there
and
she
wanted
you
first
rational
words
she
has
spoken
bless
her
heart
perhaps
she
heard
me
perhaps
it
was
telepathy
i
don
t
know
or
care
she
wanted
me
and
i
was
there
i
am
the
big
man
looked
so
proud
and
yet
so
humble
as
he
said
this
that
nan
forgot
her
dislike
and
distrust
of
him
and
begged
him
to
stay
with
them
oh
no
he
said
that
wouldn
t
do
i
ll
be
in
new
york
a
few
weeks
now
at
the
excelsior
i
ll
see
you
often
patty
when
i
may
i
won
t
stay
here
thanks
i
m
so
happy
to
have
been
of
service
and
always
command
me
of
farnsworth
bowed
and
went
off
and
the
two
fairfields
looked
at
each
other
what
an
episode
exclaimed
nan
did
he
really
save
her
life
fred
he
probably
did
we
can
never
say
for
certain
but
at
that
crisis
a
natural
sleep
is
a
godsend
he
induced
it
whether
by
a
kind
of
mesmerism
or
whether
because
patty
cares
so
much
for
him
i
can
t
say
i
hate
to
think
the
why
well
for
one
thing
you
know
that
story
van
reypen
tells
about
farnsworth
trying
to
get
patty
to
go
on
the
operatic
i
never
was
sure
about
didn
t
hear
it
so
very
well
and
farnsworth
is
not
altogether
our
own
you
mean
not
the
aristocrat
phil
is
something
like
well
all
that
doesn
t
matter
just
now
if
the
doctor
says
bill
saved
patty
s
life
i
shall
always
adore
him
and
i
shall
erect
a
very
high
monument
to
his
honour
so
there
now
nan
was
almost
gay
the
revulsion
of
feeling
brought
about
by
patty
s
improved
condition
made
her
so
joyous
she
had
to
express
it
in
some
way
first
she
tiptoed
to
the
door
and
beckoned
the
nurse
out
from
her
she
demanded
and
received
assurance
that
patty
was
really
past
the
present
danger
and
barring
relapse
or
complication
would
get
well
then
she
flew
to
the
telephone
and
told
mona
leaving
her
to
pass
the
glad
news
on
to
the
others
she
wanted
to
call
up
van
reypen
but
was
uncertain
whether
to
do
so
or
not
he
was
but
just
returned
from
his
aunt
s
burial
and
the
time
seemed
inopportune
yet
he
would
be
so
anxious
to
hear
and
perhaps
no
one
else
would
tell
him
so
she
called
him
telling
the
servant
who
answered
who
she
was
and
saying
van
reypen
might
speak
to
her
or
not
as
he
wished
of
course
i
want
to
speak
to
you
phil
s
deep
voice
responded
how
is
she
better
really
better
she
will
get
well
if
there
are
no
oh
so
glad
nan
i
have
been
so
saddened
these
last
few
days
i
couldn
t
go
to
you
as
i
wished
because
of
affairs
here
now
dear
old
aunty
is
laid
to
rest
and
soon
i
must
come
over
i
don
t
hope
to
see
patty
but
i
want
a
talk
with
you
may
i
come
tonight
surely
philip
come
when
you
will
you
are
always
but
i
don
t
know
nan
said
to
fred
fairfield
what
philip
will
say
when
he
knows
who
it
was
that
brought
about
patty
s
need
he
know
need
anybody
know
perhaps
when
patty
can
have
a
say
in
the
matter
she
will
not
wish
it
known
the
nurses
won
t
tell
need
we
perhaps
not
said
nan
thoughtfully
chapter
xviii
patty
s
fortune
though
patty
s
recovery
was
steady
it
was
very
very
slow
the
utmost
care
was
taken
against
relapse
and
so
greatly
had
the
disease
sapped
her
strength
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
her
to
regain
it
but
skilled
nursing
proved
effectual
in
the
end
and
the
day
came
at
last
when
patty
was
allowed
to
see
one
or
two
visitors
adele
was
the
first
to
be
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
convalescent
she
had
come
down
from
fern
falls
as
soon
as
the
welcome
word
reached
her
that
she
might
see
patty
she
was
to
remain
with
her
but
a
few
moments
and
then
if
no
harm
resulted
the
next
day
mona
was
to
be
admitted
patty
herself
was
eager
to
see
her
friends
and
showed
decided
interest
in
getting
arrayed
for
the
occasion
of
adele
s
visit
this
greatly
pleased
nurse
adams
for
until
now
patty
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
news
or
discussion
of
the
outer
world
and
had
shown
a
listless
apathy
when
nan
or
her
father
told
her
of
the
doings
of
the
young
people
of
her
set
this
had
been
partly
due
to
her
weakened
condition
and
partly
to
her
brooding
in
secret
over
the
promise
she
had
given
van
reypen
she
had
never
mentioned
this
subject
to
nan
nor
had
they
yet
told
patty
of
van
reypen
s
death
the
doctor
forbade
the
introduction
of
any
exciting
topic
and
this
news
of
her
dear
old
friend
would
surely
startle
her
i
ll
wear
my
blue
de
negligée
patty
directed
the
one
with
lace
insets
and
the
cap
with
empire
bows
and
delightful
said
miss
adams
it
will
be
a
pleasant
change
to
see
you
dressed
up
for
i
haven
t
been
dolled
up
in
so
long
i
most
forget
how
to
primp
but
i
daresay
it
will
come
back
to
me
for
i
m
a
very
vain
that
s
good
and
nurse
adams
laughed
it
s
always
a
good
sign
when
a
patient
revives
an
interest
in
i
doubt
if
i
ever
lost
mine
really
it
was
probably
lying
dormant
all
through
the
late
unpleasantness
now
please
my
blue
brocade
mules
and
some
blue
stockings
no
ones
i
miss
adams
brushed
the
mop
of
golden
curls
that
had
been
so
in
the
way
during
the
severe
illness
and
massed
them
high
on
the
little
head
crowning
all
with
the
dainty
cap
of
lace
and
ribbons
now
i
will
gracefully
recline
on
my
boudoir
couch
and
await
the
raising
of
the
you
darling
thing
cried
adele
as
she
entered
if
you
aren
t
the
same
old
patty
course
i
am
who
did
you
think
i
would
be
oh
but
it
s
good
to
see
you
i
haven
t
seen
a
soul
but
the
regular
army
for
weeks
and
months
and
years
patty
had
never
referred
to
farnsworth
s
presence
and
no
one
had
spoken
of
it
to
her
they
had
concluded
that
she
was
really
unconscious
of
it
or
it
had
lapsed
from
her
memory
and
you
re
looking
so
well
your
cheeks
are
quite
pink
and
why
i
do
declare
you
look
almost
pretty
think
i
look
ravishingly
beautiful
i
ve
consulted
a
mirror
today
for
the
first
time
and
i
was
so
glad
to
see
myself
again
it
was
quite
like
meeting
an
old
friend
how
s
jim
fine
sent
you
so
many
loving
messages
i
decline
to
repeat
dear
old
jim
give
him
my
best
tomorrow
i
m
to
see
mona
isn
t
that
gay
yes
but
i
d
rather
you
d
be
more
interested
in
my
call
than
to
be
looking
forward
to
you
old
goose
do
you
s
pose
i
d
had
you
first
if
i
didn
t
love
you
most
now
i
know
you
re
getting
well
you
ve
not
lost
your
knack
of
making
pretty
it
s
a
comfort
to
have
somebody
to
make
them
to
the
doctors
were
most
unimpressionable
and
i
can
t
bamboozle
miss
adams
with
flattery
she
won
t
stand
for
it
the
nurse
smiled
at
her
pretty
patient
and
patty
went
on
after
mona
i
m
to
see
elise
and
the
other
girls
and
then
if
you
please
i
m
to
be
allowed
to
see
some
of
my
boy
friends
oh
you
coquette
you
re
just
looking
forward
with
all
your
eyes
to
having
chick
and
kit
and
all
the
rest
come
in
and
tell
you
how
well
you
re
yes
and
patty
folded
her
hands
demurely
it
s
such
pleasant
hearing
after
weeks
of
looking
like
a
mummy
all
skin
and
patty
you
re
incorrigible
and
adele
laughed
fondly
at
the
girl
she
loved
so
well
but
you
re
certainly
looking
the
part
of
interesting
invalid
all
right
isn
t
she
fairfield
rather
said
nan
who
had
just
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
your
visit
is
doing
her
a
lot
of
good
why
she
looks
quite
her
old
a
sort
of
reincarnated
version
of
her
old
self
all
made
over
new
by
the
way
patty
i
saw
maude
kent
did
you
adele
what
is
she
doing
now
concerts
as
usual
i
heard
about
her
session
with
your
father
and
adele
laughed
the
idea
of
her
thinking
you
d
dream
of
the
stage
but
think
what
a
great
tragedienne
is
lost
to
the
world
said
patty
i
know
i
have
marvelous
talent
but
my
stern
parents
refused
to
let
me
prove
the
most
outrageous
ideal
declared
nan
nobody
but
that
farnsworth
would
have
suggested
such
a
thing
i
suppose
westerners
have
a
different
code
of
conventions
from
bill
farnsworth
suggest
it
cried
patty
why
nan
you
re
crazy
he
s
the
one
who
kept
me
from
it
wasn
t
he
adele
why
yes
nan
it
was
he
who
went
over
to
poland
spring
with
yes
that
s
what
i
heard
took
patty
over
there
to
see
this
kent
person
about
the
goodness
gracious
me
patty
exclaimed
wherever
did
you
get
such
a
mixup
nansome
why
it
was
little
billee
who
gave
maude
whatfor
because
she
mentioned
the
idea
he
told
her
never
to
dream
of
it
and
made
me
go
straight
nan
looked
puzzled
why
she
said
philip
van
reypen
told
me
that
farnsworth
put
you
up
to
it
and
said
you
were
patty
laughed
outright
oh
nannie
i
remember
that
said
i
was
enough
and
bill
said
yes
i
was
course
he
had
to
agree
he
said
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
and
as
to
phil
he
knew
nothing
about
it
he
wasn
t
no
somebody
told
him
that
day
he
met
you
all
in
oh
somebody
said
that
somebody
else
heard
that
listen
here
nan
nobody
put
me
up
to
that
stage
business
ceptin
my
own
little
self
and
of
course
maude
who
told
me
about
it
but
she
did
nothing
wrong
in
giving
me
the
chance
and
it
s
all
past
history
only
don
t
you
say
little
billee
egged
me
on
because
he
most
emphatically
egged
me
off
didn
t
he
adele
yes
he
did
you
told
me
all
about
it
at
the
time
bill
farnsworth
was
most
indignant
at
miss
kent
but
she
was
a
friend
of
chick
channing
s
and
so
bill
wouldn
t
say
anything
against
there
isn
t
anything
against
her
declared
patty
and
little
billee
wouldn
t
say
it
if
there
were
but
you
just
remember
that
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
if
anybody
sort
of
approved
of
it
it
was
chick
he
thought
it
would
be
rather
fun
but
he
didn
t
take
it
seriously
at
all
so
you
just
cross
off
that
black
mark
you
have
against
big
bill
i
will
promised
nan
and
adele
said
where
is
bill
now
have
you
seen
him
of
late
no
said
patty
not
since
before
i
was
ill
i
don
t
know
where
he
nan
looked
at
her
closely
but
it
was
evident
she
was
speaking
in
earnest
as
they
thought
then
she
had
forgotten
the
incident
of
his
appearance
at
her
bedside
perhaps
she
never
really
knew
of
it
as
she
was
so
nearly
unconscious
at
the
time
he
is
in
new
york
said
nan
covertly
watching
patty
is
he
said
patty
with
some
animation
after
i
get
well
enough
to
see
i
d
like
to
have
him
very
well
returned
nan
but
now
i
m
going
to
take
adele
away
the
nurse
has
been
making
signals
to
me
for
five
minutes
past
you
mustn
t
get
overtired
with
your
first
visitor
or
you
can
t
have
but
visitors
seemed
to
agree
with
patty
once
back
in
the
atmosphere
of
gay
chatter
and
laughter
with
her
friends
she
grew
better
rapidly
and
the
roses
came
back
to
her
cheeks
and
the
strength
to
her
body
and
so
when
they
thought
she
could
bear
it
they
told
her
of
van
reypen
s
death
i
suspected
it
said
patty
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
just
because
you
didn
t
say
anything
about
her
and
evaded
my
questions
when
was
it
they
told
her
all
about
it
and
then
fairfield
said
and
my
child
in
her
will
was
a
large
bequest
for
i
know
said
patty
and
her
fingers
locked
nervously
together
a
hundred
thousand
million
dollars
or
it
might
as
well
be
i
don
t
want
the
money
but
it
is
yours
and
in
your
trust
you
can
t
well
refuse
it
half
is
yes
i
know
a
children
s
home
but
i
can
t
build
a
house
don
t
think
about
those
things
until
you
are
stronger
the
home
project
will
keep
years
if
need
be
and
when
the
time
comes
all
the
burdensome
details
will
be
in
the
hands
of
a
board
of
trustees
and
you
needn
t
carry
it
on
your
poor
little
it
isn
t
that
that
s
bothering
me
but
my
own
half
you
don
t
know
she
gave
me
why
did
she
said
nan
quickly
her
woman
s
mind
half
divining
the
truth
she
made
me
promise
the
last
time
i
saw
her
i
would
marry
philip
and
when
i
said
i
wouldn
t
promise
she
was
very
angry
and
said
then
she
wouldn
t
leave
me
the
money
and
i
was
madder
than
she
was
and
said
i
didn
t
want
her
old
money
and
neither
i
don
t
with
philip
or
without
but
what
an
extraordinary
proceeding
exclaimed
fairfield
she
tried
to
buy
you
oh
well
of
course
she
didn
t
put
it
that
way
but
she
was
all
honey
and
peaches
and
leaving
me
fortunes
and
building
children
s
homes
until
i
refused
to
promise
she
turned
and
railed
at
and
prompted
nan
then
i
was
mad
and
i
tried
to
start
for
home
then
she
calmed
down
and
was
sweet
again
and
said
she
didn
t
mean
to
balance
the
money
against
the
promise
but
kept
at
me
until
she
me
give
and
you
promised
you
poor
little
patty
cried
nan
you
poor
dear
little
thing
how
could
she
torture
you
so
it
was
nan
cried
patty
eagerly
it
was
just
that
oh
i
m
so
glad
you
can
see
it
i
didn
t
know
to
do
she
said
i
mustn
t
refuse
the
request
of
a
dying
woman
and
she
grabbed
my
arm
and
shook
me
and
she
looked
like
she
just
looked
you
know
and
i
guess
she
hypnotised
me
into
of
course
she
did
it
s
a
perfect
shame
and
nan
gathered
patty
into
her
arms
it
a
shame
agreed
fairfield
smiling
at
his
daughter
but
it
won
t
be
such
an
awfully
hard
promise
to
keep
will
it
little
girl
of
course
you
hated
to
have
it
put
to
you
in
that
manner
but
there
are
less
desirable
men
in
this
world
than
philip
van
i
don
t
want
to
talk
about
it
said
patty
and
she
burst
into
tears
on
nan
s
shoulder
and
you
sha
n
t
returned
nan
caressing
her
go
away
fred
a
man
doesn
t
know
how
to
deal
with
a
case
like
this
patty
isn
t
strong
enough
yet
to
think
of
bothersome
things
you
go
away
and
we
ll
tell
you
later
what
we
fairfield
rose
grumbling
laughingly
that
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
called
down
by
his
own
family
but
he
went
away
saying
over
his
shoulder
you
girls
just
want
to
have
a
tearfest
that
s
tell
me
all
about
it
dear
said
nan
as
patty
smiled
through
her
tears
that
s
about
all
nancy
but
it
was
such
a
horrid
situation
i
do
like
phil
but
i
don
t
want
to
make
any
such
promise
as
that
of
course
phil
has
asked
me
himself
several
times
but
i
ve
never
said
or
no
or
no
i
don
t
have
to
till
i
get
ready
do
i
and
i
surely
don
t
have
to
give
my
promise
to
the
aunt
of
the
person
most
interested
oh
i
m
so
sorry
she
died
i
wanted
to
ask
her
to
let
me
off
i
dreamed
about
it
all
the
time
i
was
sick
it
was
like
a
continual
nightmare
has
phil
been
here
yes
two
or
three
times
he
wants
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
say
how
can
i
see
him
do
you
suppose
he
knows
of
my
promise
very
likely
she
told
him
i
don
t
know
but
patty
don
t
blame
her
too
much
you
know
she
was
very
fond
of
you
and
she
worshipped
him
it
was
the
wish
of
her
heart
no
she
any
right
to
force
your
promise
that
s
what
she
did
she
forced
it
nan
am
i
bound
by
it
why
no
that
is
not
unless
you
want
to
be
or
unless
i
consider
a
promise
made
to
a
dying
person
sacred
well
i
m
afraid
i
do
i
ve
thought
over
this
thing
day
in
and
day
out
and
it
seems
to
me
i
d
be
to
break
a
promise
given
to
one
who
is
maybe
philip
will
let
you
no
he
won
t
i
know
phil
wants
me
to
marry
him
and
he
d
take
me
on
any
terms
this
sounds
conceited
but
i
cause
he
s
told
me
well
patty
why
not
that
s
just
it
i
don
t
know
why
not
sometimes
i
think
it
s
just
because
i
don
t
want
to
be
made
to
do
a
thing
whether
i
choose
or
not
and
then
sometimes
well
sometimes
i
think
i
don
t
love
phil
enough
to
marry
him
he
s
a
dear
and
he
s
awfully
kind
and
generous
and
good
and
he
adores
me
i
don
t
nan
were
you
in
love
with
father
when
you
married
him
i
was
patty
and
i
still
yes
i
know
you
are
now
but
were
you
before
the
wedding
day
well
i
m
not
in
love
with
phil
but
he
says
that
will
come
after
we
re
married
will
it
nan
it
s
hard
to
advise
you
patty
i
daren
t
say
the
greater
love
will
come
to
you
i
don
t
know
but
don
t
marry
him
unless
you
are
sure
he
is
the
only
man
in
the
world
you
can
i
ve
got
to
marry
him
said
patty
simply
i
chapter
xix
a
disturbing
letter
then
the
days
came
when
patty
could
see
anybody
and
everybody
who
called
upon
her
when
she
could
be
downstairs
in
the
library
or
the
big
cheery
and
as
she
expressed
it
be
folks
once
more
still
flowers
were
sent
to
her
still
candies
and
fruit
and
dainty
delicacies
arrived
in
boxes
and
baskets
and
friends
sent
books
pictures
and
letters
her
mail
was
voluminous
so
much
so
that
nurse
adams
who
still
tarried
was
pressed
into
service
as
amanuensis
and
general
secretary
the
men
had
begun
to
be
allowed
to
call
and
patty
saw
cameron
and
channing
who
happened
to
call
first
my
but
it
s
good
to
gaze
on
your
haughty
beauty
again
said
chick
i
ve
missed
you
more
than
tongue
can
tell
me
too
said
kit
i
wanted
to
telephone
but
they
wouldn
t
let
me
said
i
was
too
near
and
dear
to
be
heard
without
being
seen
the
children
or
whoever
it
i
wish
you
had
and
patty
laughed
i
was
longing
to
babble
over
a
telephone
as
we
used
to
do
yes
in
the
early
days
of
our
courtship
when
we
were
speak
for
yourself
john
i
ll
leave
it
to
chick
i
look
i
should
say
not
you
look
sweet
sixteen
or
he
was
right
for
patty
did
look
adorably
young
and
sweet
she
had
on
a
frenchy
of
pale
green
silk
bubbling
over
with
tulle
frills
of
the
same
shade
touched
here
and
there
with
tiny
rosebuds
a
fetching
cap
of
matching
materials
was
nan
declared
a
mere
piece
of
affectation
but
it
accented
her
invalidism
and
was
vastly
becoming
her
face
still
pale
from
her
illness
was
of
a
waxen
hue
but
a
warm
pink
had
begun
to
glow
in
her
cheeks
and
her
blue
eyes
were
as
twinkling
and
roguish
as
ever
and
what
s
more
patty
went
on
i
won
t
be
till
next
may
that
s
ages
away
yes
about
half
a
year
retorted
kit
so
i
m
not
so
very
far
out
my
little
old
lady
did
you
get
all
the
tokens
i
sent
you
guess
i
did
i
m
acknowledging
em
up
as
fast
as
i
can
i
had
such
oodles
of
stuff
i
begrudge
the
flowers
that
came
while
i
was
too
lost
to
the
world
to
see
them
but
enough
have
come
since
to
make
up
you
ll
get
your
receipts
in
due
thanks
i
was
afraid
mine
were
lost
in
the
shuffle
i
say
patty
when
can
you
go
out
for
a
spin
not
this
week
next
go
with
me
first
no
me
put
in
chick
i
ve
a
limousine
he
has
only
a
lots
more
fun
in
a
runabout
besides
i
asked
you
what
fun
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
it
s
like
a
dance
i
m
going
to
have
a
programme
wait
here
s
patty
found
an
old
dance
programme
in
the
desk
near
her
and
kit
kindly
essayed
to
rub
off
the
names
then
with
his
fountain
pen
he
wrote
over
the
dances
limousine
runabout
matinée
and
a
host
of
other
pleasures
to
which
patty
might
reasonably
expect
to
be
invited
soon
but
she
would
only
allow
them
one
each
and
after
they
had
written
their
names
after
the
rides
they
were
shooed
away
by
ever
watchful
nan
who
would
not
allow
patty
to
become
overtired
then
one
morning
in
the
mail
came
a
communication
from
van
reypen
s
lawyer
it
informed
patty
of
the
legacy
left
her
as
van
reypen
had
said
there
was
a
bequest
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
patty
herself
and
another
fifty
thousand
in
trust
for
a
fund
for
a
children
s
home
the
details
of
the
institution
were
left
entirely
to
patty
s
discretion
and
she
was
instructed
if
in
need
of
more
funds
to
apply
to
philip
van
reypen
also
was
enclosed
a
note
which
van
reypen
had
written
and
directed
to
be
given
to
patty
after
her
death
i
m
afraid
to
open
it
nan
said
patty
trembling
as
she
looked
at
the
sealed
epistle
i
don
t
wonder
you
feel
so
dear
let
me
read
it
gladly
patty
passed
it
over
for
she
had
no
secrets
from
nan
and
her
nerves
were
not
yet
as
strong
as
before
her
illness
nan
read
it
and
then
said
you
need
have
no
fear
patty
it
s
a
dear
note
listen
my
dear
little
patty
i
am
afraid
i
made
you
sorrowful
when
i
talked
to
you
and
urged
you
to
promise
the
thing
i
asked
of
you
but
don
t
feel
hard
toward
me
i
have
your
interests
at
heart
as
well
as
philip
s
and
i
know
that
what
you
have
promised
will
mean
your
life
s
happiness
now
about
the
children
s
home
if
you
feel
that
after
all
it
is
too
great
a
tax
on
your
time
or
strength
to
take
it
in
charge
don
t
do
so
turn
it
all
over
to
some
one
else
you
and
philip
can
decide
on
the
right
person
for
the
work
but
i
trust
you
will
have
an
interest

big
luncheon

all
up
pretty
for
what
an
entrancing
programme
nan
sometimes
i
think
you
re
a
genius
i
sure
do
the
enticing
programme
was
carried
out
and
that
afternoon
van
reypen
came
to
call
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
patty
since
her
illness
and
she
rather
dreaded
the
meeting
but
philip
was
so
cheery
and
kindly
that
patty
felt
at
ease
at
once
dear
little
girl
he
said
taking
both
her
hands
how
good
to
see
you
looking
so
well
i
ve
been
anxious
about
needn
t
be
any
more
said
patty
smiling
up
at
him
i
m
all
well
now
and
never
going
to
be
sick
again
but
i
ve
been
feeling
very
sorry
for
you
thank
you
dear
it
is
hard
the
old
house
seems
so
empty
and
lonely
but
aunty
van
rather
wanted
to
go
and
she
bade
me
think
of
her
only
with
pleasant
memories
and
not
with
she
was
always
thoughtful
of
others
feelings
and
phil
how
she
did
love
she
did
and
you
too
why
i
never
supposed
she
could
care
for
any
one
outside
our
family
as
she
cared
for
she
was
awfully
kind
to
and
you
were
to
her
you
were
mighty
good
patty
to
put
up
with
her
queer
little
notions
the
way
you
always
did
and
i
say
do
you
know
what
she
told
me
just
before
she
died
she
told
me
that
you
said
you
would
learn
to
love
me
oh
patty
did
you
i
don
t
doubt
her
word
but
sometimes
she
thought
a
thing
was
so
when
really
it
was
only
her
strong
wish
so
i
ask
you
i
didn
t
mean
to
ask
you
today
meant
to
wait
till
you
are
strong
and
well
again
but
darling
you
look
so
sweet
and
dear
and
i
haven
t
seen
you
for
so
long
i
can
t
wait
tell
me
patty
you
tell
aunty
van
that
patty
hesitated
a
yes
or
no
here
meant
so
much
yet
she
couldn
t
put
him
off
tell
me
he
urged
you
must
have
said
something
of
the
sort
even
if
she
exaggerated
she
wouldn
t
make
it
up
what
did
you
tell
her
dear
the
two
were
alone
in
the
library
the
dusk
was
just
beginning
lights
not
yet
turned
on
patty
in
a
great
easy
chair
sat
near
the
wood
fire
which
had
burned
down
to
a
few
glowing
embers
van
reypen
restless
had
been
stalking
about
the
room
now
he
came
near
to
her
and
pushing
up
an
ottoman
he
sat
down
by
her
you
must
tell
me
he
said
in
a
low
tense
voice
i
can
t
bear
it
if
you
don
t
i
won
t
ask
you
anything
more
ll
go
right
away
if
you
say
so
patty
dearest
tell
me
if
you
told
aunty
van
that
you
would
learn
to
love
phil
s
dark
handsome
face
looked
into
her
own
with
a
feeling
as
of
a
tightening
round
her
heart
patty
realised
that
his
eyes
were
very
like
his
aunt
s
that
their
impelling
gaze
would
yet
make
her
say
yes
and
fascinated
she
gazed
back
until
coerced
she
breathed
a
low
then
appalled
at
the
look
that
came
to
his
face
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
whispering
go
away
phil
you
said
you
d
go
away
if
i
wanted
you
to
and
i
do
want
you
to
please
van
reypen
leaned
nearer
i
will
go
little
sweetheart
i
can
bear
to
go
now
you
have
made
me
so
happy
with
that
one
little
word
the
rest
can
wait
you
will
call
me
back
soon
i
bending
down
he
dropped
a
light
kiss
on
the
curly
golden
hair
and
went
away
happy
in
the
knowledge
of
patty
s
love
and
almost
amused
at
what
he
thought
was
her
shyness
in
acknowledging
it
when
she
heard
the
street
door
close
patty
looked
up
her
face
was
white
and
she
was
nervously
trembling
illustration
tell
me
if
you
told
aunty
van
that
you
would
learn
to
love
me
nan
she
called
nan
nan
came
in
from
another
room
what
is
it
patty
dear
where
is
philip
he
s
gone
oh
nan
i
kept
my
you
did
what
do
you
mean
are
you
engaged
to
philip
then
why
did
he
go
patty
laughed
but
it
was
a
little
hysterical
i
sent
him
away
no
we
re
not
engaged
that
is
i
don
t
think
we
are
but
i
suppose
we
will
patty
behave
yourself
brace
up
now
and
tell
me
what
you
re
talking
about
any
one
would
think
getting
engaged
was
a
funeral
or
some
such
occasion
patty
shook
herself
and
smiled
at
nan
i
am
a
goose
i
suppose
i
don
t
know
whether
i
m
glad
or
sorry
but
i
told
phil
i
d
learn
to
love
h
m
i
don
t
see
as
you
ve
bound
yourself
to
anything
very
desperate
you
can
doubtless
learn
if
you
study
hard
don
t
tease
me
nan
i
m
not
sure
i
want
to
then
don
t
patty
sometimes
you
re
perfectly
ridiculous
huh
just
cause
happened
to
get
a
perfectly
splendid
man
like
my
father
and
didn
t
have
to
think
twice
you
think
can
decide
in
a
hurry
nan
burst
into
laughter
oh
you
are
funny
she
cried
and
patty
had
to
laugh
too
i
suppose
i
am
she
said
dolefully
to
you
but
to
me
it
doesn
t
seem
funny
a
forgive
me
dear
said
nan
repentantly
i
won
t
laugh
any
more
tell
me
about
it
s
that
old
promise
thing
van
told
phil
i
had
told
her
i
would
learn
to
love
him
and
he
asked
me
if
i
did
and
i
had
to
say
yes
and
of
course
i
couldn
t
tell
him
she
me
promise
now
could
i
i
don
t
know
it
a
little
serious
patty
unless
as
i
said
before
unless
you
want
to
learn
to
love
him
do
you
i
don
t
know
but
i
don
t
think
so
i
wish
to
goodness
he
wouldn
t
bother
me
about
it
he
sha
n
t
patty
it
is
a
shame
for
you
to
be
bothered
if
you
don
t
want
to
be
now
i
ll
help
you
out
i
ll
tell
phil
myself
that
you
re
not
well
enough
yet
to
be
troubled
about
serious
matters
and
he
must
wait
till
you
are
he
won
t
be
angry
i
can
explain
it
to
i
don
t
care
whether
he
s
angry
or
not
it
isn
t
that
nan
it
s
that
just
the
little
bit
i
said
to
him
he
takes
to
of
course
he
does
patty
you
can
t
tell
a
man
you
ll
learn
to
love
him
unless
you
mean
that
you
expect
to
succeed
and
that
you
ll
marry
him
what
else
you
mean
of
course
if
i
said
it
of
my
own
accord
but
don
t
you
see
nan
that
i
only
said
it
because
i
promised
her
i
would
and
it
doesn
t
seem
fair
that
i
should
have
to
say
it
because
she
made
you
re
right
patty
it
and
you
ought
not
to
be
held
by
that
infamous
performance
i
just
begin
to
see
it
as
it
is
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
tortured
you
don
t
really
love
phil
or
you
d
know
it
and
this
promise
and
learning
to
love
him
is
all
foolishness
i
m
going
to
tell
him
or
have
fred
do
so
of
that
promise
business
and
then
if
he
wants
to
ask
you
again
and
let
you
answer
of
your
own
will
and
not
by
anybody
s
coercion
very
oh
nan
what
a
duck
you
are
what
would
i
ever
do
without
you
will
you
really
do
that
i
tried
to
tell
phil
how
it
was
but
he
was
precipitate
yes
that
but
i
meant
more
that
he
was
so
glad
to
have
me
say
that
that
it
seemed
too
bad
to
tell
him
that
awful
story
about
his
it
an
awful
story
but
he
ought
to
know
it
why
he
d
rather
know
it
you
two
couldn
t
live
all
your
lives
with
that
secret
between
you
of
course
we
couldn
and
then
too
it
isn
t
fair
to
him
if
you
re
answering
his
question
under
duress
never
did
know
what
duress
meant
anyway
if
you
re
answering
his
questions
at
his
aunt
s
commands
he
certainly
ought
to
know
it
it
s
wrong
to
let
him
think
it
s
your
own
answer
if
it
isn
that
s
so
and
patty
looked
greatly
relieved
say
nan
when
can
you
tell
him
oh
i
can
t
do
it
i
ll
get
your
father
to
he
s
the
proper
one
yes
i
guess
he
is
sighed
patty
oh
what
do
poor
little
girls
do
who
haven
t
such
kind
parents
and
now
i
wonder
if
it
isn
t
time
for
my
beef
tea
chapter
xx
better
than
anybody
else
it
was
the
next
afternoon
that
farnsworth
called
he
had
not
seen
patty
since
the
day
she
was
so
very
ill
but
he
had
telephoned
or
called
every
day
to
inquire
after
her
today
he
was
allowed
to
see
her
and
as
he
entered
the
library
his
face
was
radiant
with
sunny
smiles
patty
looked
up
smiling
too
and
held
out
her
hands
in
greeting
from
the
lace
cap
that
crowned
her
hair
to
the
tips
of
her
dainty
slippers
she
was
all
in
white
and
her
pale
face
and
waxen
hands
made
her
look
so
like
an
angel
that
big
strapping
bill
held
his
breath
as
he
looked
at
her
are
you
really
there
he
asked
are
you
fastened
to
earth
i
somehow
feel
afraid
you
ll
waft
off
into
the
ether
you
look
so
no
indeed
i
m
here
to
stay
i
ve
a
pretty
strong
liking
for
this
old
world
and
i
ve
no
desire
to
flee
away
just
good
it
s
great
to
see
you
again
and
farnsworth
took
a
seat
beside
her
i
m
thinking
you
ll
be
getting
out
of
doors
i
hope
so
but
i
m
having
a
beautiful
time
convalescing
everybody
is
so
good
to
me
and
i
m
showered
with
presents
as
if
i
and
i
hear
that
you
bill
looked
at
her
steadily
i
m
told
that
you
re
betrothed
to
van
reypen
and
i
want
to
be
among
the
first
to
wish
you
all
the
joy
there
is
in
the
who
told
you
and
patty
looked
startled
a
little
bird
farnsworth
smiled
at
her
gently
i
am
very
glad
for
you
dear
philip
is
a
big
chap
and
he
can
give
you
all
you
want
and
most
anybody
could
do
that
said
patty
a
little
shortly
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
farnsworth
took
the
news
of
her
engagement
rather
easily
no
i
couldn
t
there
are
not
many
men
like
van
reypen
rich
intellectual
and
kind
moreover
he
has
prestige
and
an
acknowledged
place
in
the
best
society
all
of
which
goes
to
make
up
the
atmosphere
of
life
that
best
suits
you
petted
bill
s
smile
robbed
the
words
of
any
effect
of
satire
or
reproof
am
i
a
rattlepate
and
patty
treated
the
young
man
to
her
best
and
prettiest
pout
not
entirely
but
you
like
to
have
all
about
you
in
harmony
and
good
taste
nor
are
you
to
blame
you
are
born
to
the
purple
all
that
that
aren
t
you
i
farnsworth
looked
amazed
no
patty
i
am
what
they
call
a
man
my
people
are
plain
people
and
my
childhood
was
one
of
rough
experiences
all
the
more
credit
to
you
little
billee
for
turning
out
a
polished
but
i
m
not
dear
i
ve
picked
up
enough
of
social
customs
not
to
make
awkward
mistakes
but
i
have
not
the
innate
breeding
of
the
van
farnsworth
was
not
looking
at
patty
he
was
staring
into
vacancy
and
looked
as
if
he
were
talking
more
to
himself
than
to
her
rubbish
said
patty
gaily
annoyed
at
herself
for
feeling
the
truth
of
his
words
you
re
a
splendid
old
bill
and
whoever
says
a
word
against
you
is
no
friend
of
mine
so
be
careful
sir
what
you
say
against
you
re
a
loyal
little
friend
patty
and
i
m
more
glad
than
you
can
realise
to
know
that
it
is
so
now
you
re
going
to
do
all
you
can
to
grow
stronger
aren
t
you
it
hurts
me
to
see
you
so
white
and
i
wish
i
could
give
you
some
of
my
big
strength
ve
more
than
i
know
what
to
do
at
this
speech
patty
blushed
a
rosy
crimson
and
farnsworth
s
remark
about
her
wan
looks
lost
its
point
why
the
apple
blossoms
in
your
cheeks
little
girl
and
he
smiled
at
her
evident
confusion
would
you
give
me
of
your
strength
bill
i
wouldn
t
i
i
d
snatch
you
back
from
old
charon
if
you
had
one
foot
in
his
boat
patty
looked
at
him
with
a
queer
uncertainty
in
her
eyes
twice
she
tried
to
say
something
and
couldn
t
and
then
farnsworth
said
softly
as
i
did
i
doubt
if
you
knew
did
you
billee
i
thought
it
was
a
dream
t
it
you
no
patty
it
was
not
a
dream
i
chanced
to
come
in
and
when
i
asked
about
you
you
must
have
heard
my
voice
for
you
called
out
to
and
you
yes
and
you
wanted
some
of
my
strength
gave
it
to
you
by
putting
you
to
sleep
that
was
what
you
needed
was
that
the
crisis
bill
they
said
so
dear
i
am
glad
i
could
you
saved
my
i
m
not
sure
of
that
but
i
wish
i
had
for
you
know
there
is
a
convention
that
gives
saved
lives
to
the
take
it
then
said
patty
impulsively
farnsworth
gave
her
a
long
look
i
wouldn
t
want
it
because
you
thought
you
to
give
it
to
yet
that
is
why
i
m
giving
it
to
he
didn
t
save
your
life
no
i
mean
i
m
giving
it
to
him
because
i
think
i
ought
what
you
mean
and
then
patty
told
him
the
whole
story
of
her
promise
to
van
reypen
and
her
consequent
enforced
betrothal
to
philip
farnsworth
s
blue
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
takes
you
on
those
terms
oh
he
doesn
t
know
about
the
promise
but
what
else
can
i
do
little
billee
i
can
t
break
a
promise
made
to
a
dying
woman
like
like
isn
t
enough
said
farnsworth
sternly
do
you
love
him
patty
guess
she
stammered
a
little
frightened
at
his
vehemence
and
at
that
very
moment
philip
van
reypen
appeared
hello
peaches
he
said
gaily
to
patty
how
do
farnsworth
and
how
s
our
interesting
invalid
today
i
m
fine
returned
patty
getting
better
by
the
minute
spect
to
go
out
coasting
soon
better
get
your
sleds
ready
we
may
have
snow
any
patty
was
babbling
on
to
cover
a
certain
constraint
in
the
attitude
of
the
two
men
but
almost
immediately
farnsworth
took
his
leave
gently
declining
patty
s
plea
to
stay
longer
let
him
go
said
philip
as
the
street
door
closed
behind
bill
i
want
to
see
you
alone
see
here
patty
what
s
this
about
a
promise
to
aunty
van
who
told
you
your
father
sent
and
asked
me
to
come
to
his
office
so
i
went
and
he
told
me
the
whole
story
you
poor
little
girl
i
m
sorry
it
happened
and
i
ve
come
to
ask
you
to
forgive
aunty
van
she
was
all
wrong
to
do
such
a
thing
but
honestly
she
was
actuated
by
right
motives
she
loved
you
so
and
she
loved
me
and
she
was
so
sure
we
were
made
for
each
other
i
m
sure
of
that
too
if
you
re
not
you
re
to
say
so
and
not
think
you
re
bound
by
a
promise
to
but
i
did
promise
forget
it
in
your
dealings
with
me
you
re
to
deal
only
with
me
there
s
no
or
dictator
or
even
adviser
only
just
our
two
selves
but
before
we
begin
on
our
affairs
i
want
this
other
matter
settled
for
all
time
promise
me
that
you
will
never
again
even
think
of
that
promise
that
she
wrung
from
you
you
or
i
can
t
have
loving
memories
of
aunty
van
also
i
want
you
to
tell
me
truly
whether
you
want
to
look
after
the
children
s
home
scheme
or
not
if
it
s
a
burden
you
re
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
see
how
kind
you
are
phil
yes
i
do
want
to
help
with
the
home
project
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
board
whatever
has
charge
of
it
i
want
to
tend
to
the
furnishings
and
little
comforty
things
for
the
kiddies
but
can
t
somebody
else
build
it
of
course

you
think
you
re
to
have
all
that
on
your
poor
little
shoulders
it
shall
all
be
just
as
you
say
and
you
are
to
do
as
much
or
as
little
as
you
like
of
course
you
re
not
even
to
think
of
it
till
you
re
all
well
and
strong
again
now
as
to
your
own
bequest
from
aunty
van
i
can
t
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
she
left
you
a
little
a
little
exclaimed
patty
raising
her
eyes
heavenward
well
an
enormous
fortune

like
that
better
but
at
any
rate
it
s
yours
to

t
suppose

it
i
don
t
need
it

but

lovely
things

part
of
it

of
it

the
delightfullest
plans

right
pattykins

what
you
will
as
long
as
it
pleases
your
own
dear
self
and
now
we
come
to
what
interests
me
most
i
decline
to
have
you
for
my
very
own
if
you
consent
because
aunty
van
made
you
promise
to

that
all
out
let
s
begin
again
will
you
promise
me
mind
you
any
one
else
me
learn
to
love
me
and
now
patty
was
her
own
roguish
self
again
the
release
from
the
bugbear
promise
was
so
great
that
she
considered
gaily
what
phil
was
asking
now
well
she
began
looking
provokingly
pretty
suppose
i
say
i
ll
to
learn
to
love
oh
make
a
stab
at
it
but
all
right
i
ll
take
that
crumb
of
a
promise
you
ll
to
learn
to
love
me
patty
going
to
be
the
teacher
and
if
you
ll
try
you
ll
have
to
since
you
ve
promised
jove
i
ll
you
learn
very
well
and
patty
s
eyes
danced
when
you
going
to
begin
right
off
this
minute
and
never
stop
short
of
success
van
reypen
looked
very
handsome
his
dark
hair
tossed
back
from
his
broad
forehead
his
dark
eyes
alight
with
love
and
determination
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
meets
any
circumstances
with
graceful
ease
and
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
patty
with
an
air
of
assured
proprietorship
that
amused
rather
than
irritated
her
but
i
m
not
engaged
to
you
and
patty
shook
her
head
till
her
curls
bobbed
no
oh
be
let
s
be
at
what
engaged
before
i
ve
learned
to
love

all
right
sweetness

ll
wait
but
it
won
t
be
long
the
poet

of
love

protracted
growing
but
ours
won
t
be
so
terribly
protracted
i
promise
you
i
ll
give
you
a
week
to
decide
in
that
s
too
a
week

couldn
t
begin
to

that
time

month
and
i

right

be
proud
of

a
month
that

a
century

a
nope

month

i
need
to
say
yes
or
no
to
your
question
one
more
month
of
gay
girlish
freedom
oh
phil
i
couldn
t
be
tied
down
to
any
one
man
i
want
to
flirt
with
all
of
them
do
it
in
this
month
then
for
i
warn
you
after
more
days
your
flirtations
must
be
laid
aside
with
your
wax
doll
and
britannia
you
seem
pretty
positive
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
i
ve
lots
of
faults
but
a
faint
heart
isn
t
one
of
them
you
re
the
girl
for
me
but
you
don
t
quite
know
it
for
sure
so
i
m
going
to
show
you
the
truth
and
gently
but
firmly
lead
you
to
it
philip
kept
the
conversation
in
this
light
key
and
when
he
went
away
patty
retained
the
impression
of
a
very
charming
afternoon
with
him
he
nice
she
said
to
nan
after
telling
her
all
about
it
you
feel
so
sort
of
sure
of
him
all
the
time
he
always
does
the
right
yes
said
nan
next
day
brought
many
visitors
but
among
the
most
welcome
was
baby
milly
or
middy
as
she
called
herself
and
as
patty
always
called
her
such
a
booful
patty
the
child
exclaimed
delighted
at
seeing
her
again
after
so
long
a
time
middy
loves
you
drefful
see
middy
b
inged
lot
o
naws
she
means
noahs
ma
am
explained
the
nurse
who
had
milly
in
charge
they
re
the
dolls
from
her
noah
s
sure
enough
the
baby
had
the
four
puppets
that
represent
in
painted
wood
the
patriarch
and
his
three
sons
they
were
up
in
patty
s
boudoir
and
the
little
one
gaily
stood
her
cherished
toys
round
among
the
small
ferns
in
the
suddenly
patty
grabbed
her
up
and
carried
her
off
to
have
a
feast
of
bread
and
jam
and
milk
nice
party
the
guest
remarked
des
patty
an
middy
ve
y
nice
after
the
party
the
little
one
was
taken
home
and
so
it
was
not
until
she
went
to
her
room
that
night
that
patty
discovered
the
four
naws
still
marching
through
her
ferns
blessed
baby
she
said
to
herself
as
she
collected
the
illustrious
quartette
and
laid
them
on
the
table
to
be
returned
to
their
owner
the
next
day
then
patty
threw
herself
in
a
big
chair
to
think
over
her
problems
she
hadn
t
told
farnsworth
that
she
was
not
now
engaged
to
philip
and
she
didn
t
quite
like
to
tell
him
though
why
she
couldn
t
say
i
wonder
who
i
like
best
of
anybody
in
all
the
world
she
mused
as
she
played
idly
with
middy
s
toys
i
m
as
uncertain
of
that
as
i
am
which
of
these
four
statuettes
i
she
looked
critically
at
the
noah
and
at
shem
ham
and
japheth
a
little
undecided
as
to
which
was
which
so
similar
were
they
in
every
respect
save
as
to
the
colours
of
their
long
gowns
she
stood
them
in
a
row
on
the
table
that
s
philip
looking
at
one
of
them
that
s
little
billee
that
s
kit
and
the
yellow
one
is
chick
channing
i
ve
come
to
like
chick
a
lot
n
kit
i
believe
now
let
s
see
s
pose
i
had
to
lose
one
of
these
four
forever
which
could
i
best
the
game
grew
exciting
patty
sitting
on
one
foot
leaned
toward
the
table
middle
caught
against
her
thumb
ready
to
snap
the
least
desirable
into
limbo
sorry
she
said
but
old
kit
must
she
snapped
her
fingers
and
luckless
kit
flew
across
the
room
patty
s
face
fell
it
s
a
hard
world
but
i
m
going
to
fight
this
thing
to
a
finish
and
there
s
no
use
mincing
matters
if
another
had
to
would
of
course
be
another
flick
of
her
slender
fingers
and
channing
flew
up
in
the
air
and
landed
on
the
high
mantel
now
then
and
patty
knew
that
a
momentous
decision
lay
before
her
there
remained
philip
and
bill
farnsworth
patty
clasped
her
hands
rested
her
chin
upon
them
and
stared
at
the
brown
and
gentlemen
still
standing
before
her
phil
is
such
a
dear
she
reasoned
as
if
trying
to
convince
herself
and
he
certainly
does
worship
the
ground
i
walk
on
but
there
s
something
about
little
billee
i
wonder
what
it
is
about
he
save
my
think
i
like
him
for
his
strength
i
never
saw
anybody
so
always
makes
me
think
of
sir
galahad
his
strength
was
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
his
heart
was
little
billee
s
heart
is
pure
gold
i
know
it
by
a
sort
of
intuition
and
yet
philip
is
a
gentleman
of
course
i
know
that
but
bill
is
nature
s
any
way
just
at
this
minute
i
like
little
billee
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
so
there
now
with
a
flick
of
her
fingertips
patty
set
philip
spinning
and
it
was
a
week
later
that
she
found
him
in
her
she
had
the
grace
to
look
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
but
the
fire
of
determination
was
in
her
eye
and
a
rosy
flush
tinted
her
cheeks
then
a
mischievous
smile
came
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
on
an
impulse
she
caught
up
the
telephone
from
the
stand
and
called
the
excelsior
hotel
in
a
few
moments
farnsworth
s
hello
sounded
in
her
ear
it
s
patty
she
said
in
a
small
timid
voice
well
i
m
glad
are
we
to
have
a
little
chat
no
just
wanted
to
tell
tell
yes

little
girl

can
t
seem
to
tell
you

only

to
say

laugh
in
my
voice
when

world
has
suddenly
turned
to
rosy
sunlight
tell
me
apple
blossom
is
that
all
you
called
up
to
say
no
and
patty
s
eyes
grew
luminous
i
going
to
say
something
what
was
it
me
at
this
present
moment
for
little
you
know
i
else
in
all
the
world
and
with
a
sudden
click
patty
hung
up
the
receiver
and
buried
her
burning
face
in
her
hands
