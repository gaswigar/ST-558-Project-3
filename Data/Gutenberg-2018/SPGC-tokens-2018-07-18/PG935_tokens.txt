preface
this
is
a
revised
edition
of
a
book
which
has
already
been
received
with
considerable
favour
at
home
and
abroad
it
has
been
reprinted
in
various
forms
in
america
translations
have
appeared
in
dutch
and
french
and
others
are
about
to
appear
in
german
and
danish
the
book
has
doubtless
proved
attractive
to
readers
in
different
countries
by
reason
of
the
variety
of
anecdotal
illustrations
of
life
and
character
which
it
contains
and
the
interest
which
all
more
or
less
feel
in
the
labours
the
trials
the
struggles
and
the
achievements
of
others
no
one
can
be
better
aware
than
the
author
of
its
fragmentary
character
arising
from
the
manner
in
which
it
was
for
the
most
part
originally
composed
been
put
together
principally
from
jottings
made
during
many
years
as
readings
for
young
men
and
without
any
view
to
publication
the
appearance
of
this
edition
has
furnished
an
opportunity
for
pruning
the
volume
of
some
superfluous
matter
and
introducing
various
new
illustrations
which
will
probably
be
found
of
general
interest
in
one
respect
the
title
of
the
book
which
it
is
now
too
late
to
alter
has
proved
unfortunate
as
it
has
led
some
who
have
judged
it
merely
by
the
title
to
suppose
that
it
consists
of
a
eulogy
of
selfishness
the
very
opposite
of
what
it
really
is
at
least
of
what
the
author
intended
it
to
be
although
its
chief
object
unquestionably
is
to
stimulate
youths
to
apply
themselves
diligently
to
right
pursuits
neither
labour
pains
nor
in
prosecuting
them
to
rely
upon
their
own
efforts
in
life
rather
than
depend
upon
the
help
or
patronage
of
others
it
will
also
be
found
from
the
examples
given
of
literary
and
scientific
men
artists
inventors
educators
philanthropists
missionaries
and
martyrs
that
the
duty
of
helping
one
s
self
in
the
highest
sense
involves
the
helping
of
one
s
neighbours
it
has
also
been
objected
to
the
book
that
too
much
notice
is
taken
in
it
of
men
who
have
succeeded
in
life
by
helping
themselves
and
too
little
of
the
multitude
of
men
who
have
failed
why
should
not
failure
it
has
been
asked
have
its
plutarch
as
well
as
success
there
is
indeed
no
reason
why
failure
should
not
have
its
plutarch
except
that
a
record
of
mere
failure
would
probably
be
found
excessively
depressing
as
well
as
uninstructive
reading
it
is
however
shown
in
the
following
pages
that
failure
is
the
best
discipline
of
the
true
worker
by
stimulating
him
to
renewed
efforts
evoking
his
best
powers
and
carrying
him
onward
in
and
growth
in
knowledge
and
wisdom
viewed
in
this
light
failure
conquered
by
perseverance
is
always
full
of
interest
and
instruction
and
this
we
have
endeavoured
to
illustrate
by
many
examples
as
for
failure
although
it
may
be
well
to
find
consolations
for
it
at
the
close
of
life
there
is
reason
to
doubt
whether
it
is
an
object
that
ought
to
be
set
before
youth
at
the
beginning
of
it
indeed
how
to
do
it
is
of
all
things
the
easiest
learnt
it
needs
neither
teaching
effort
industry
patience
perseverance
nor
judgment
besides
readers
do
not
care
to
know
about
the
general
who
lost
his
battles
the
engineer
whose
engines
blew
up
the
architect
who
designed
only
deformities
the
painter
who
never
got
beyond
daubs
the
schemer
who
did
not
invent
his
machine
the
merchant
who
could
not
keep
out
of
the
gazette
it
is
true
the
best
of
men
may
fail
in
the
best
of
causes
but
even
these
best
of
men
did
not
try
to
fail
or
regard
their
failure
as
meritorious
on
the
contrary
they
tried
to
succeed
and
looked
upon
failure
as
misfortune
failure
in
any
good
cause
is
however
honourable
whilst
success
in
any
bad
cause
is
merely
infamous
at
the
same
time
success
in
the
good
cause
is
unquestionably
better
than
failure
but
it
is
not
the
result
in
any
case
that
is
to
be
regarded
so
much
as
the
aim
and
the
effort
the
patience
the
courage
and
the
endeavour
with
which
desirable
and
worthy
objects
are
pursued
tis
not
in
mortals
to
command
success
we
will
do
the
object
of
the
book
briefly
is
to
these
but
wholesome
perhaps
can
not
be
too
often
urged
youth
must
work
in
order
to
enjoy
nothing
creditable
can
be
accomplished
without
application
and
diligence
the
student
must
not
be
daunted
by
difficulties
but
conquer
them
by
patience
and
perseverance
that
above
all
he
must
seek
elevation
of
character
without
which
capacity
is
worthless
and
worldly
success
is
naught
if
the
author
has
not
succeeded
in
illustrating
these
lessons
he
can
only
say
that
he
has
failed
in
his
object

besides

which
it

to

introduction
to
the
first
edition
the
origin
of
this
book
may
be
briefly
told
some
fifteen
years
since
the
author
was
requested
to
deliver
an
address
before
the
members
of
some
evening
classes
which
had
been
formed
in
a
northern
town
for
mutual
improvement
under
the
following
circumstances
two
or
three
young
men
of
the
humblest
rank
resolved
to
meet
in
the
winter
evenings
for
the
purpose
of
improving
themselves
by
exchanging
knowledge
with
each
other
their
first
meetings
were
held
in
the
room
of
a
cottage
in
which
one
of
the
members
lived
and
as
others
shortly
joined
them
the
place
soon
became
inconveniently
filled
when
summer
set
in
they
adjourned
to
the
cottage
garden
outside
and
the
classes
were
then
held
in
the
open
air
round
a
little
boarded
hut
used
as
a
in
which
those
who
officiated
as
teachers
set
the
sums
and
gave
forth
the
lessons
of
the
evening
when
the
weather
was
fine
the
youths
might
be
seen
until
a
late
hour
hanging
round
the
door
of
the
hut
like
a
cluster
of
bees
but
sometimes
a
sudden
shower
of
rain
would
dash
the
sums
from
their
slates
and
disperse
them
for
the
evening
unsatisfied
winter
with
its
cold
nights
was
drawing
near
and
what
were
they
to
do
for
shelter
their
numbers
had
by
this
time
so
increased
that
no
room
of
an
ordinary
cottage
could
accommodate
them
though
they
were
for
the
most
part
young
men
earning
comparatively
small
weekly
wages
they
resolved
to
incur
the
risk
of
hiring
a
room
and
on
making
inquiry
they
found
a
large
dingy
apartment
to
let
which
had
been
used
as
a
temporary
cholera
hospital
no
tenant
could
be
found
for
the
place
which
was
avoided
as
if
the
plague
still
clung
to
it
but
the
mutual
improvement
youths
nothing
daunted
hired
the
cholera
room
at
so
much
a
week
lit
it
up
placed
a
few
benches
and
a
deal
table
in
it
and
began
their
winter
classes
the
place
soon
presented
a
busy
and
cheerful
appearance
in
the
evenings
the
teaching
may
have
been
as
no
doubt
it
was
of
a
very
rude
and
imperfect
sort
but
it
was
done
with
a
will
those
who
knew
a
little
taught
those
who
knew
themselves
while
they
improved
the
others
and
at
all
events
setting
before
them
a
good
working
example
thus
these
there
were
also
grown
men
amongst
to
teach
themselves
and
each
other
reading
and
writing
arithmetic
and
geography
and
even
mathematics
chemistry
and
some
of
the
modern
languages
about
a
hundred
young
men
had
thus
come
together
when
growing
ambitious
they
desired
to
have
lectures
delivered
to
them
and
then
it
was
that
the
author
became
acquainted
with
their
proceedings
a
party
of
them
waited
on
him
for
the
purpose
of
inviting
him
to
deliver
an
introductory
address
or
as
they
expressed
it
to
talk
to
them
a
bit
prefacing
the
request
by
a
modest
statement
of
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
were
doing
he
could
not
fail
to
be
touched
by
the
admirable
spirit
which
they
had
displayed
and
though
entertaining
but
slight
faith
in
popular
lecturing
he
felt
that
a
few
words
of
encouragement
honestly
and
sincerely
uttered
might
not
be
without
some
good
effect
and
in
this
spirit
he
addressed
them
on
more
than
one
occasion
citing
examples
of
what
other
men
had
done
as
illustrations
of
what
each
might
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
do
for
himself
and
pointing
out
that
their
happiness
and
as
individuals
in
after
life
must
necessarily
depend
mainly
upon
their
own
diligent
and
above
all
on
that
honest
and
upright
performance
of
individual
duty
which
is
the
glory
of
manly
character
there
was
nothing
in
the
slightest
degree
new
or
original
in
this
counsel
which
was
as
old
as
the
proverbs
of
solomon
and
possibly
quite
as
familiar
but
though
the
advice
may
have
been
it
was
welcomed
the
youths
went
forward
in
their
course
worked
on
with
energy
and
resolution
and
reaching
manhood
they
went
forth
in
various
directions
into
the
world
where
many
of
them
now
occupy
positions
of
trust
and
usefulness
several
years
after
the
incidents
referred
to
the
subject
was
unexpectedly
recalled
to
the
author
s
recollection
by
an
evening
visit
from
a
young
fresh
from
the
work
of
a
explained
that
he
was
now
an
employer
of
labour
and
a
thriving
man
and
he
was
pleased
to
remember
with
gratitude
the
words
spoken
in
all
honesty
to
him
and
to
his
years
before
and
even
to
attribute
some
measure
of
his
success
in
life
to
the
endeavours
which
he
had
made
to
work
up
to
their
spirit
the
author
s
personal
interest
having
in
this
way
been
attracted
to
the
subject
of
he
was
accustomed
to
add
to
the
memoranda
from
which
he
had
addressed
these
young
men
and
to
note
down
occasionally
in
his
leisure
evening
moments
after
the
hours
of
business
the
results
of
such
reading
observation
and
experience
of
life
as
he
conceived
to
bear
upon
it
one
of
the
most
prominent
illustrations
cited
in
his
earlier
addresses
was
that
of
george
stephenson
the
engineer
and
the
original
interest
of
the
subject
as
well
as
the
special
facilities
and
opportunities
which
the
author
possessed
for
illustrating
stephenson
s
life
and
career
induced
him
to
prosecute
it
at
his
leisure
and
eventually
to
publish
his
biography
the
present
volume
is
written
in
a
similar
spirit
as
it
has
been
similar
in
its
origin
the
illustrative
sketches
of
character
introduced
are
however
necessarily
less
elaborately
busts
rather
than
portraits
and
in
many
of
the
cases
only
some
striking
feature
has
been
noted
the
lives
of
individuals
as
indeed
of
nations
often
concentrating
their
lustre
and
interest
in
a
few
passages
such
as
the
book
is
the
author
now
leaves
it
in
the
hands
of
the
reader
in
the
hope
that
the
lessons
of
industry
perseverance
and
which
it
contains
will
be
found
useful
and
instructive
as
well
as

of
many

true
source
of
national
vigour
and
strength
help
from
without
is
often
enfeebling
in
its
effects
but
help
from
within
invariably
invigorates
whatever
is
done
men
or
classes
to
a
certain
extent
takes
away
the
stimulus
and
necessity
of
doing
for
themselves
and
where
men
are
subjected
to
and
the
inevitable
tendency
is
to
render
them
comparatively
helpless
even
the
best
institutions
can
give
a
man
no
active
help
perhaps
the
most
they
can
do
is
to
leave
him
free
to
develop
himself
and
improve
his
individual
condition
but
in
all
times
men
have
been
prone
to
believe
that
their
happiness
and
were
to
be
secured
by
means
of
institutions
rather
than
by
their
own
conduct
hence
the
value
of
legislation
as
an
agent
in
human
advancement
has
usually
been
much
to
constitute
the
millionth
part
of
a
legislature
by
voting
for
one
or
two
men
once
in
three
or
five
years
however
conscientiously
this
duty
may
be
performed
can
exercise
but
little
active
influence
upon
any
man
s
life
and
character
moreover
it
is
every
day
becoming
more
clearly
understood
that
the
function
of
government
is
negative
and
restrictive
rather
than
positive
and
active
being
resolvable
principally
into
of
life
liberty
and
property
laws
wisely
administered
will
secure
men
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
their
labour
whether
of
mind
or
body
at
a
comparatively
small
personal
sacrifice
but
no
laws
however
stringent
can
make
the
idle
industrious
the
thriftless
provident
or
the
drunken
sober
such
reforms
can
only
be
effected
by
means
of
individual
action
economy
and
by
better
habits
rather
than
by
greater
rights
the
government
of
a
nation
itself
is
usually
found
to
be
but
the
reflex
of
the
individuals
composing
it
the
government
that
is
ahead
of
the
people
will
inevitably
be
dragged
down
to
their
level
as
the
government
that
is
behind
them
will
in
the
long
run
be
dragged
up
in
the
order
of
nature
the
collective
character
of
a
nation
will
as
surely
find
its
befitting
results
in
its
law
and
government
as
water
finds
its
own
level
the
noble
people
will
be
nobly
ruled
and
the
ignorant
and
corrupt
ignobly
indeed
all
experience
serves
to
prove
that
the
worth
and
strength
of
a
state
depend
far
less
upon
the
form
of
its
institutions
than
upon
the
character
of
its
men
for
the
nation
is
only
an
aggregate
of
individual
conditions
and
civilization
itself
is
but
a
question
of
the
personal
improvement
of
the
men
women
and
children
of
whom
society
is
composed
national
progress
is
the
sum
of
individual
industry
energy
and
uprightness
as
national
decay
is
of
individual
idleness
selfishness
and
vice
what
we
are
accustomed
to
decry
as
great
social
evils
will
for
the
most
part
be
found
to
be
but
the
outgrowth
of
man
s
own
perverted
life
and
though
we
may
endeavour
to
cut
them
down
and
extirpate
them
by
means
of
law
they
will
only
spring
up
again
with
fresh
luxuriance
in
some
other
form
unless
the
conditions
of
personal
life
and
character
are
radically
improved
if
this
view
be
correct
then
it
follows
that
the
highest
patriotism
and
philanthropy
consist
not
so
much
in
altering
laws
and
modifying
institutions
as
in
helping
and
stimulating
men
to
elevate
and
improve
themselves
by
their
own
free
and
independent
individual
action
it
may
be
of
comparatively
little
consequence
how
a
man
is
governed
from
without
whilst
everything
depends
upon
how
he
governs
himself
from
within
the
greatest
slave
is
not
he
who
is
ruled
by
a
despot
great
though
that
evil
be
but
he
who
is
the
thrall
of
his
own
moral
ignorance
selfishness
and
vice
nations
who
are
thus
enslaved
at
heart
can
not
be
freed
by
any
mere
changes
of
masters
or
of
institutions
and
so
long
as
the
fatal
delusion
prevails
that
liberty
solely
depends
upon
and
consists
in
government
so
long
will
such
changes
no
matter
at
what
cost
they
may
be
effected
have
as
little
practical
and
lasting
result
as
the
shifting
of
the
figures
in
a
phantasmagoria
the
solid
foundations
of
liberty
must
rest
upon
individual
character
which
is
also
the
only
sure
guarantee
for
social
security
and
national
progress
john
stuart
mill
truly
observes
that
even
despotism
does
not
produce
its
worst
effects
so
long
as
individuality
exists
under
it
and
whatever
crushes
individuality
despotism
by
whatever
name
it
be
old
fallacies
as
to
human
progress
are
constantly
turning
up
some
call
for
cæsars
others
for
nationalities
and
others
for
acts
of
parliament
we
are
to
wait
for
cæsars
and
when
they
are
found
happy
the
people
who
recognise
and
follow
this
doctrine
shortly
means
everything
the
people
nothing
them
doctrine
which
if
taken
as
a
guide
must
by
destroying
the
free
conscience
of
a
community
speedily
prepare
the
way
for
any
form
of
despotism
cæsarism
is
human
idolatry
in
its
worst
worship
of
mere
power
as
degrading
in
its
effects
as
the
worship
of
mere
wealth
would
be
a
far
healthier
doctrine
to
inculcate
among
the
nations
would
be
that
of
and
so
soon
as
it
is
thoroughly
understood
and
carried
into
action
cæsarism
will
be
no
more
the
two
principles
are
directly
antagonistic
and
what
victor
hugo
said
of
the
pen
and
the
sword
alike
applies
to
them
ceci
tuera
this
will
kill
that
the
power
of
nationalities
and
acts
of
parliament
is
also
a
prevalent
superstition
what
william
dargan
one
of
ireland
s
truest
patriots
said
at
the
closing
of
the
first
dublin
industrial
exhibition
may
well
be
quoted
now
to
tell
the
truth
he
said
i
never
heard
the
word
independence
mentioned
that
my
own
country
and
my
own
fellow
townsmen
did
not
occur
to
my
mind
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
independence
that
we
were
to
get
from
this
that
and
the
other
place
and
of
the
great
expectations
we
were
to
have
from
persons
from
other
countries
coming
amongst
us
whilst
i
value
as
much
as
any
man
the
great
advantages
that
must
result
to
us
from
that
intercourse
i
have
always
been
deeply
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
our
industrial
independence
is
dependent
upon
ourselves
i
believe
that
with
simple
industry
and
careful
exactness
in
the
utilization
of
our
energies
we
never
had
a
fairer
chance
nor
a
brighter
prospect
than
the
present
we
have
made
a
step
but
perseverance
is
the
great
agent
of
success
and
if
we
but
go
on
zealously
i
believe
in
my
conscience
that
in
a
short
period
we
shall
arrive
at
a
position
of
equal
comfort
of
equal
happiness
and
of
equal
independence
with
that
of
any
other
all
nations
have
been
made
what
they
are
by
the
thinking
and
the
working
of
many
generations
of
men
patient
and
persevering
labourers
in
all
ranks
and
conditions
of
life
cultivators
of
the
soil
and
explorers
of
the
mine
inventors
and
discoverers
manufacturers
mechanics
and
artisans
poets
philosophers
and
politicians
all
have
contributed
towards
the
grand
result

generation
building
upon
another
s
labours
and
carrying
them
forward
to
still
higher
stages
this
constant
succession
of
noble
artisans
of
served
to
create
order
out
of
chaos
in
industry
science
and
art
and
the
living
race
has
thus
in
the
course
of
nature
become
the
inheritor
of
the
rich
estate
provided
by
the
skill
and
industry
of
our
forefathers
which
is
placed
in
our
hands
to
cultivate
and
to
hand
down
not
only
unimpaired
but
improved
to
our
successors
the
spirit
of
as
exhibited
in
the
energetic
action
of
individuals
has
in
all
times
been
a
marked
feature
in
the
english
character
and
furnishes
the
true
measure
of
our
power
as
a
nation
rising
above
the
heads
of
the
mass
there
were
always
to
be
found
a
series
of
individuals
distinguished
beyond
others
who
commanded
the
public
homage
but
our
progress
has
also
been
owing
to
multitudes
of
smaller
and
less
known
men
though
only
the
generals
names
may
be
remembered
in
the
history
of
any
great
campaign
it
has
been
in
a
great
measure
through
the
individual
valour
and
heroism
of
the
privates
that
victories
have
been
won
and
life
too
is
a
soldiers
battle
in
the
ranks
having
in
all
times
been
amongst
the
greatest
of
workers
many
are
the
lives
of
men
unwritten
which
have
nevertheless
as
powerfully
influenced
civilisation
and
progress
as
the
more
fortunate
great
whose
names
are
recorded
in
biography
even
the
humblest
person
who
sets
before
his

an
example
of

sobriety
and
upright
honesty
of

as

pass
unconsciously
into
the
lives
of
others
and
propagate
good
example
for
all
time
to
come
daily
experience
shows
that
it
is
energetic
individualism
which
produces
the
most
powerful
effects
upon
the
life
and
action
of
others
and
really
constitutes
the
best
practical
education
schools
academies
and
colleges
give
but
the
merest
beginnings
of
culture
in
comparison
with
it
far
more
influential
is
the
daily
given
in
our
homes
in
the
streets
behind
counters
in
workshops
at
the
loom
and
the
plough
in
and
manufactories
and
in
the
busy
haunts
of
men
this
is
that
finishing

schiller

discipline

and

not
to
be

bacon
observes
that
studies
teach
not
their
own
use
but
that
is
a
wisdom
without
them
and
above
them
won
by
observation
a
remark
that
holds
true
of
actual
life
as
well
as
of
the
cultivation
of
the
intellect
itself
for
all
experience
serves
to
illustrate
and
enforce
the
lesson
that
a
man
perfects
himself
by
work
more
than
by
reading
it
is
life
rather
than
literature
action
rather
than
study

character
rather

biographies

in

not
to
be
misunderstood
what
it
is
in
the
power
of
each
to
accomplish
for
himself

the
efficacy

of
usefulness
and
influence
in
society
are
indeed
so
numerous
that
they
have
long
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
exceptional
looking
at
some
of
the
more
remarkable
it
might
almost
be
said
that
early
encounter
with
difficulty
and
adverse
circumstances
was
the
necessary
and
indispensable
condition
of
success
the
british
house
of
commons
has
always
contained
a
considerable
number
of
such
representatives
of
the
industrial
character
of
the
people
and
it
is
to
the
credit
of
our
legislature
that
they
have
been
welcomed
and
honoured
there
when
the
late
joseph
brotherton
member
for
salford
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
on
the
ten
hours
bill
detailed
with
true
pathos
the
hardships
and
fatigues
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
when
working
as
a
factory
boy
in
a
cotton
mill
and
described
the
resolution
which
he
had
then
formed
that
if
ever
it
was
in
his
power
he
would
endeavour
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
that
class
sir
james
graham
rose
immediately
after
him
and
declared
amidst
the
cheers
of
the
house
that
he
did
not
before
know
that
brotherton
s
origin
had
been
so
humble
but
that
it
rendered
him
more
proud
than
he
had
ever
before
been
of
the
house
of
commons
to
think
that
a
person
risen
from
that
condition
should
be
able
to
sit
side
by
side
on
equal
terms
with
the
hereditary
gentry
of
the
land
the
late
fox
member
for
oldham
was
accustomed
to
introduce
his
recollections
of
past
times
with
the
words
when
i
was
working
as
a
weaver
boy
at
norwich
and
there
are
other
members
of
parliament
still
living
whose
origin
has
been
equally
humble
lindsay
the
ship
owner
until
recently
member
for
sunderland
once
told
the
simple
story
of
his
life
to
the
electors
of
weymouth
in
answer
to
an
attack
made
upon
him
by
his
political
opponents
he
had
been
left
an
orphan
at
fourteen
and
when
he
left
glasgow
for
liverpool
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
not
being
able
to
pay
the
usual
fare
the
captain
of
the
steamer
agreed
to
take
his
labour
in
exchange
and
the
boy
worked
his
passage
by
trimming
the
coals
in
the
coal
hole
at
liverpool
he
remained
for
seven
weeks
before
he
could
obtain
employment
during
which
time
he
lived
in
sheds
and
fared
hardly
until
at
last
he
found
shelter
on
board
a
west
indiaman
he
entered
as
a
boy
and
before
he
was
nineteen
by
steady
good
conduct
he
had
risen
to
the
command
of
a
ship
at
he
retired
from
the
sea
and
settled
on
shore
after
which
his
progress
was
rapid
he
had
prospered
he
said
by
steady
industry
by
constant
work
and
by
ever
keeping
in
view
the
great
principle
of
doing
to
others
as
you
would
be
done
the
career
of
william
jackson
of
birkenhead
the
present
member
for
north
derbyshire
bears
considerable
resemblance
to
that
of
lindsay
his
father
a
surgeon
at
lancaster
died
leaving
a
family
of
eleven
children
of
whom
william
jackson
was
the
seventh
son
the
elder
boys
had
been
well
educated
while
the
father
lived
but
at
his
death
the
younger
members
had
to
shift
for
themselves
william
when
under
twelve
years
old
was
taken
from
school
and
put
to
hard
work
at
a
ship
s
side
from
six
in
the
morning
till
nine
at
night
his
master
falling
ill
the
boy
was
taken
into
the
where
he
had
more
leisure
this
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
reading
and
having
obtained
access
to
a
set
of
the
encyclopædia
britannica
he
read
the
volumes
through
from
a
to
z
partly
by
day
but
chiefly
at
night
he
afterwards
put
himself
to
a
trade
was
diligent
and
succeeded
in
it
now
he
has
ships
sailing
on
almost
every
sea
and
holds
commercial
relations
with
nearly
every
country
on
the
globe
among
like
men
of
the
same
class
may
be
ranked
the
late
richard
cobden
whose
start
in
life
was
equally
humble
the
son
of
a
small
farmer
at
midhurst
in
sussex
he
was
sent
at
an
early
age
to
london
and
employed
as
a
boy
in
a
warehouse
in
the
city
he
was
diligent
well
conducted
and
eager
for
information
his
master
a
man
of
the
old
school
warned
him
against
too
much
reading
but
the
boy
went
on
in
his
own
course
storing
his
mind
with
the
wealth
found
in
books
he
was
promoted
from
one
position
of
trust
to
a
traveller
for
his
a
large
connection
and
eventually
started
in
business
as
a
calico
printer
at
manchester
taking
an
interest
in
public
questions
more
especially
in
popular
education
his
attention
was
gradually
drawn
to
the
subject
of
the
corn
laws
to
the
repeal
of
which
he
may
be
said
to
have
devoted
his
fortune
and
his
life
it
may
be
mentioned
as
a
curious
fact
that
the
first
speech
he
delivered
in
public
was
a
total
failure
but
he
had
great
perseverance
application
and
energy
and
with
persistency
and
practice
he
became
at
length
one
of
the
most
persuasive
and
effective
of
public
speakers
extorting
the
disinterested
eulogy
of
even
sir
robert
peel
himself
drouyn
de
lhuys
the
french
ambassador
has
eloquently
said
of
cobden
that
he
was
a
living
proof
of
what
merit
perseverance
and
labour
can
accomplish
one
of
the
most
complete
examples
of
those
men
who
sprung
from
the
humblest
ranks
of
society
raise
themselves
to
the
highest
rank
in
public
estimation
by
the
effect
of
their
own
worth
and
of
their
personal
services
finally
one
of
the
rarest
examples
of
the
solid
qualities
inherent
in
the
english
in
all
these
cases
strenuous
individual
application
was
the
price
paid
for
distinction
excellence
of
any
sort
being
invariably
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
indolence
it
is
the
diligent
hand
and
head
alone
that
maketh
growth
in
wisdom
and
in
business
even
when
men
are
born
to
wealth
and
high
social
position
any
solid
reputation
which
they
may
individually
achieve
can
only
be
attained
by
energetic
application
for
though
an
inheritance
of
acres
may
be
bequeathed
an
inheritance
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
can
not
the
wealthy
man
may
pay
others
for
doing
his
work
for
him
but
it
is
impossible
to
get
his
thinking
done
for
him
by
another
or
to
purchase
any
kind
of
indeed
the
doctrine
that
excellence
in
any
pursuit
is
only
to
be
achieved
by
laborious
application
holds
as
true
in
the
case
of
the
man
of
wealth
as
in
that
of
drew
and
gifford
whose
only
school
was
a
cobbler
s
stall
or
hugh
miller
whose
only
college
was
a
cromarty
stone
quarry
riches
and
ease
it
is
perfectly
clear
are
not
necessary
for
man
s
highest
culture
else
had
not
the
world
been
so
largely
indebted
in
all
times
to
those
who
have
sprung
from
the
humbler
ranks
an
easy
and
luxurious
existence
does
not
train
men
to
effort
or
encounter
with
difficulty
nor
does
it
awaken
that
consciousness
of
power
which
is
so
necessary
for
energetic
and
effective
action
in
life
indeed
so
far
from
poverty
being
a
misfortune
it
may
by
vigorous
be
converted
even
into
a
blessing
rousing
a
man
to
that
struggle
with
the
world
in
which
though
some
may
purchase
ease
by
degradation
the
and
find
strength
confidence
and
triumph
bacon
says
men
seem
neither
to
understand
their
riches
nor
their
strength
of
the
former
they
believe
greater
things
than
they
should
of
the
latter
much
less
and
will
teach
a
man
to
drink
out
of
his
own
cistern
and
eat
his
own
sweet
bread
and
to
learn
and
labour
truly
to
get
his
living
and
carefully
to
expend
the
good
things
committed
to
his
riches
are
so
great
a
temptation
to
ease
and
to
which
men
are
by
nature
prone
that
the
glory
is
all
the
greater
of
those
who
born
to
ample
fortunes
nevertheless
take
an
active
part
in
the
work
of
their
scorn
delights
and
live
laborious
it
is
to
the
honour
of
the
wealthier
ranks
in
this
country
that
they
are
not
idlers
for
they
do
their
fair
share
of
the
work
of
the
state
and
usually
take
more
than
their
fair
share
of
its
dangers
it
was
a
fine
thing
said
of
a
subaltern
officer
in
the
peninsular
campaigns
observed
trudging
alone
through
mud
and
mire
by
the
side
of
his
regiment
there
goes
a
year
and
in
our
own
day
the
bleak
slopes
of
sebastopol
and
the
burning
soil
of
india
have
borne
witness
to
the
like
noble
and
devotion
on
the
part
of
our
gentler
classes
many
a
gallant
and
noble
fellow
of
rank
and
estate
having
risked
his
life
or
lost
it
in
one
or
other
of
those
fields
of
action
in
the
service
of
his
country
nor
have
the
wealthier
classes
been
undistinguished
in
the
more
peaceful
pursuits
of
philosophy
and
science
take
for
instance
the
great
names
of
bacon
the
father
of
modern
philosophy
and
of
worcester
boyle
cavendish
talbot
and
rosse
in
science
the
last
named
may
be
regarded
as
the
great
mechanic
of
the
peerage
a
man
who
if
he
had
not
been
born
a
peer
would
probably
have
taken
the
highest
rank
as
an
inventor
so
thorough
is
his
knowledge
of
that
he
is
said
to
have
been
pressed
on
one
occasion
to
accept
the
foremanship
of
a
large
workshop
by
a
manufacturer
to
whom
his
rank
was
unknown
the
great
rosse
telescope
of
his
own
fabrication
is
certainly
the
most
extraordinary
instrument
of
the
kind
that
has
yet
been
constructed
but
it
is
principally
in
the
departments
of
politics
and
literature
that
we
find
the
most
energetic
labourers
amongst
our
higher
classes
success
in
these
lines
of
action
as
in
all
others
can
only
be
achieved
through
industry
practice
and
study
and
the
great
minister
or
parliamentary
leader
must
necessarily
be
amongst
the
very
hardest
of
workers
such
was
palmerston
and
such
are
derby
and
russell
disraeli
and
gladstone
these
men
have
had
the
benefit
of
no
ten
hours
bill
but
have
often
during
the
busy
season
of
parliament
worked
double
shift
almost
day
and
night
one
of
the
most
illustrious
of
such
workers
in
modern
times
was
unquestionably
the
late
sir
robert
peel
he
possessed
in
an
extraordinary
degree
the
power
of
continuous
intellectual
labour
nor
did
he
spare
himself
his
career
indeed
presented
a
remarkable
example
of
how
much
a
man
of
comparatively
moderate
powers
can
accomplish
by
means
of
assiduous
application
and
indefatigable
industry
during
the
forty
years
that
he
held
a
seat
in
parliament
his
labours
were
prodigious
he
was
a
most
conscientious
man
and
whatever
he
undertook
to
do
he
did
thoroughly
all
his
speeches
bear
evidence
of
his
careful
study
of
everything
that
had
been
spoken
or
written
on
the
subject
under
consideration
he
was
elaborate
almost
to
excess
and
spared
no
pains
to
adapt
himself
to
the
various
capacities
of
his
audience
withal
he
possessed
much
practical
sagacity
great
strength
of
purpose
and
power
to
direct
the
issues
of
action
with
steady
hand
and
eye
in
one
respect
he
surpassed
most
men
his
principles
broadened
and
enlarged
with
time
and
age
instead
of
contracting
only
served
to
mellow
and
ripen
his
nature
to
the
last
he
continued
open
to
the
reception
of
new
views
and
though
many
thought
him
cautious
to
excess
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
fall
into
that
indiscriminating
admiration
of
the
past
which
is
the
palsy
of
many
minds
similarly
educated
and
renders
the
old
age
of
many
nothing
but
a
pity
the
indefatigable
industry
of
lord
brougham
has
become
almost
proverbial
his
public
labours
have
extended
over
a
period
of
upwards
of
sixty
years
during
which
he
has
ranged
over
many
law
literature
politics
and
science
achieved
distinction
in
them
all
how
he
contrived
it
has
been
to
many
a
mystery
once
when
sir
samuel
romilly
was
requested
to
undertake
some
new
work
he
excused
himself
by
saying
that
he
had
no
time
but
he
added
go
with
it
to
that
fellow
brougham
he
seems
to
have
time
for
the
secret
of
it
was
that
he
never
left
a
minute
unemployed
withal
he
possessed
a
constitution
of
iron
when
arrived
at
an
age
at
which
most
men
would
have
retired
from
the
world
to
enjoy
their
leisure
perhaps
to
doze
away
their
time
in
an
easy
chair
lord
brougham
commenced
and
prosecuted
a
series
of
elaborate
investigations
as
to
the
laws
of
light
and
he
submitted
the
results
to
the
most
scientific
audiences
that
paris
and
london
could
muster
about
the
same
time
he
was
passing
through
the
press
his
admirable
sketches
of
the
men
of
science
and
literature
of
the
reign
of
george
and
taking
his
full
share
of
the
law
business
and
the
political
discussions
in
the
house
of
lords
sydney
smith
once
recommended
him
to
confine
himself
to
only
the
transaction
of
so
much
business
as
three
strong
men
could
get
through
but
such
was
brougham
s
love
of
become
a
no
amount
of
application
seems
to
have
been
too
great
for
him
and
such
was
his
love
of
excellence
that
it
has
been
said
of
him
that
if
his
station
in
life
had
been
only
that
of
a
he
would
never
have
rested
satisfied
until
he
had
become
the
best
in
england
another
man
of
the
same
class
is
sir
bulwer
lytton
few
writers
have
done
more
or
achieved
higher
distinction
in
various
a
novelist
poet
dramatist
historian
essayist
orator
and
politician
he
has
worked
his
way
step
by
step
disdainful
of
ease
and
animated
throughout
by
the
ardent
desire
to
excel
on
the
score
of
mere
industry
there
are
few
living
english
writers
who
have
written
so
much
and
none
that
have
produced
so
much
of
high
quality
the
industry
of
bulwer
is
entitled
to
all
the
greater
praise
that
it
has
been
entirely
to
hunt
and
shoot
and
live
at
ease
frequent
the
clubs
and
enjoy
the
opera
with
the
variety
of
london
visiting
and
during
the
season
and
then
off
to
the
country
mansion
with
its
preserves
and
its
thousand
delightful
pleasures
travel
abroad
to
paris
vienna
or
rome
this
is
excessively
attractive
to
a
lover
of
pleasure
and
a
man
of
fortune
and
by
no
means
calculated
to
make
him
voluntarily
undertake
continuous
labour
of
any
kind
yet
these
pleasures
all
within
his
reach
bulwer
must
as
compared
with
men
born
to
similar
estate
have
denied
himself
in
assuming
the
position
and
pursuing
the
career
of
a
literary
man
like
byron
his
first
effort
was
poetical
weeds
and
wild
flowers
and
a
failure
his
second
was
a
novel
falkland
and
it
proved
a
failure
too
a
man
of
weaker
nerve
would
have
dropped
authorship
but
bulwer
had
pluck
and
perseverance
and
he
worked
on
determined
to
succeed
he
was
incessantly
industrious
read
extensively
and
from
failure
went
courageously
onwards
to
success
pelham
followed
falkland
within
a
year
and
the
remainder
of
bulwer
s
literary
life
now
extending
over
a
period
of
thirty
years
has
been
a
succession
of
triumphs
disraeli
affords
a
similar
instance
of
the
power
of
industry
and
application
in
working
out
an
eminent
public
career
his
first
achievements
were
like
bulwer
s
in
literature
and
he
reached
success
only
through
a
succession
of
failures
his
wondrous
tale
of
alroy
and
revolutionary
epic
were
laughed
at
and
regarded
as
indications
of
literary
lunacy
but
he
worked
on
in
other
directions
and
his
coningsby
sybil
and
tancred
proved
the
sterling
stuff
of
which
he
was
made
as
an
orator
too
his
first
appearance
in
the
house
of
commons
was
a
failure
it
was
spoken
of
as
more
screaming
than
an
adelphi
though
composed
in
a
grand
and
ambitious
strain
every
sentence
was
hailed
with
loud
hamlet
played
as
a
comedy
were
nothing
to
it
but
he
concluded
with
a
sentence
which
embodied
a
prophecy
writhing
under
the
laughter
with
which
his
studied
eloquence
had
been
received
he
exclaimed
i
have
begun
several
times
many
things
and
have
succeeded
in
them
at
last
i
shall
sit
down
now
but
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
hear
the
time
did
come
and
how
disraeli
succeeded
in
at

commanding
the
attention
of

in

affords
a
striking
illustration
of
what
energy
and
determination
will
do
for
disraeli
earned
his
position
by
dint
of
patient
industry
he
did
not
as
many
young
men
do
having
once
failed
retire
dejected
to
mope
and
whine
in
a
corner
but
diligently
set
himself
to
work
he
carefully
unlearnt
his
faults
studied
the
character
of
his
audience
practised
sedulously
the
art
of
speech
and
industriously
filled
his
mind
with
the
elements
of
parliamentary
knowledge
he
worked
patiently
for
success
and
it
came
but
slowly
then
the
house
laughed
with
him
instead
of
at
him
the
recollection
of
his
early
failure
was
effaced
and
by
general
consent
he
was
at
length
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
most
finished
and
effective
of
parliamentary
speakers
although
much
may
be
accomplished
by
means
of
individual
industry
and
energy
as
these
and
other
instances
set
forth
in
the
following
pages
serve
to
illustrate
it
must
at
the
same
time
be
acknowledged
that
the
help
which
we
derive
from
others
in
the
journey
of
life
is
of
very
great
importance
the
poet
wordsworth
has
well
said
that
these
two
things
contradictory
though
they
may
seem
must
go
dependence
and
manly
independence
manly
reliance
and
manly
from
infancy
to
old
age
all
are
more
or
less
indebted
to
others
for
nurture
and
culture
and
the
best
and
strongest
are
usually
found
the
readiest
to
acknowledge
such
help
take
for
example
the
career
of
the
late
alexis
de
tocqueville
a
man
doubly
for
his
father
was
a
distinguished
peer
of
france
and
his
mother
a
of
malesherbes
through
powerful
family
influence
he
was
appointed
judge
auditor
at
versailles
when
only
but
probably
feeling
that
he
had
not
fairly
won
the
position
by
merit
he
determined
to
give
it
up
and
owe
his
future
advancement
in
life
to
himself
alone
a
foolish
resolution
some
will
say
but
de
tocqueville
bravely
acted
it
out
he
resigned
his
appointment
and
made
arrangements
to
leave
france
for
the
purpose
of
travelling
through
the
united
states
the
results
of
which
were
published
in
his
great
book
on
democracy
in
his
friend
and
travelling
companion
gustave
de
beaumont
has
described
his
indefatigable
industry
during
this
journey
his
nature
he
says
was
wholly
averse
to
idleness
and
whether
he
was
travelling
or
resting
his
mind
was
always
at
work
with
alexis
the
most
agreeable
conversation
was
that
which
was
the
most
useful
the
worst
day
was
the
lost
day
or
the
day
ill
spent
the
least
loss
of
time
annoyed
tocqueville
himself
wrote
to
a
there
is
no
time
of
life
at
which
one
can
wholly
cease
from
action
for
effort
without
one
s
self
and
still
more
effort
within
is
equally
necessary
if
not
more
so
when
we
grow
old
as
it
is
in
youth
i
compare
man
in
this
world
to
a
traveller
journeying
without
ceasing
towards
a
colder
and
colder
region
the
higher
he
goes
the
faster
he
ought
to
walk
the
great
malady
of
the
soul
is
cold
and
in
resisting
this
formidable
evil
one
needs
not
only
to
be
sustained
by
the
action
of
a
mind
employed
but
also
by
contact
with
one
s
fellows
in
the
business
of
notwithstanding
de
tocqueville
s
decided
views
as
to
the
necessity
of
exercising
individual
energy
and
no
one
could
be
more
ready
than
he
was
to
recognise
the
value
of
that
help
and
support
for
which
all
men
are
indebted
to
others
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
thus
he
often
acknowledged
with
gratitude
his
obligations
to
his
friends
de
kergorlay
and
stofells
the
former
for
intellectual
assistance
and
to
the
latter
for
moral
support
and
sympathy
to
de
kergorlay
he
thine
is
the
only
soul
in
which
i
have
confidence
and
whose
influence
exercises
a
genuine
effect
upon
my
own
many
others
have
influence
upon
the
details
of
my
actions
but
no
one
has
so
much
influence
as
thou
on
the
origination
of
fundamental
ideas
and
of
those
principles
which
are
the
rule
of
de
tocqueville
was
not
less
ready
to
confess
the
great
obligations
which
he
owed
to
his
wife
marie
for
the
preservation
of
that
temper
and
frame
of
mind
which
enabled
him
to
prosecute
his
studies
with
success
he
believed
that
a
woman
insensibly
elevated
the
character
of
her
husband
while
one
of
a
grovelling
nature
as
certainly
tended
to
degrade
it
in
fine
human
character
is
moulded
by
a
thousand
subtle
influences
by
example
and
precept
by
life
and
literature
by
friends
and
neighbours
by
the
world
we
live
in
as
well
as
by
the
spirits
of
our
forefathers
whose
legacy
of
good
words
and
deeds
we
inherit
but
great
unquestionably
though
these
influences
are
acknowledged
to
be
it
is
nevertheless
equally
clear
that
men
must
necessarily
be
the
active
agents
of
their
own
and
and
that
however
much
the
wise
and
the
good
may
owe
to
others
they
themselves
must
in
the
very
nature
of
things
be
their

for

their

standing
out
prominent

distinct
in

as
strikingly
characteristic
of

now
as
at

it

this
spirit
displayed
by
the

which
has
laid
the
foundations
and
built
up
the

greatness
of

this
vigorous
growth
of

has
been
mainly
the
result
of
the

energy
of
individuals
and
it
has
been
contingent
upon
the
number
of
hands
and
minds
from

actively
employed
within
it
whether
as
cultivators
of

soil
producers
of
articles
of
utility
contrivers
of
tools
and
machines
writers
of
books
or
creators
of
works
of
art
and
while
this
spirit
of
active
industry
has
been
the
vital
principle
of
the
nation
it
has
also
been
its
saving
and
remedial
one
counteracting
from
time
to
time
the
effects
of
errors
in
our
laws
and
imperfections
in
our

the
career
of

which
the

pursued
has
also
proved
its

the

more

than
the

by
any
other
condition
the
array
of
great
names
which
we
have
already
cursorily
cited
of
men
springing
from
the
ranks
of
the
industrial
classes
who
have
achieved
distinction
in
various
walks
of
science

and
that
at
all

the
difficulties
interposed
by
poverty
and
labour
are
not
insurmountable
as
respects
the
great
contrivances
and
inventions
which
have
conferred
so
much
power
and
wealth
upon
the
nation
it
is
unquestionable
that
for
the
greater
part
of
them
we
have
been
indebted
to
men
of
the
humblest
rank
deduct
what
they
have
done
in
this
particular
line
of
action
and
it
will
be
found
that
very
little
indeed
remains
for
other
men
to
have
accomplished
inventors

set
in
motion
some
of
the
greatest
industries
of
the
world
to
them
society
owes
many
of
its
chief
necessaries
comforts
and
luxuries
and
by
their
genius
and
labour
daily
life
has
been
rendered
in
all
respects
more
easy
as
well
as
enjoyable
our
food
our
clothing
the
furniture
of
our
homes
the
glass
which
admits
the
light
to
our
dwellings
at
the
same
time
that
it
excludes
the
cold
the
gas
which
illuminates
our
streets
our
means
of
locomotion
by
land
and
by
sea
the
tools
by
which
our
various
articles
of
necessity
and
luxury
are
fabricated
have
been
the
result
of
the
labour
and
ingenuity
of
many
men
and
many
minds
mankind
at
large
are
all
the
happier
for
such
inventions
and
are
every
day
reaping
the
benefit
of
them
in
an
increase
of
individual
as
well
as
of
public
enjoyment
though
the
invention
of
the
working
king
of
comparatively
speaking
to
our
own
epoch
the
idea
of
it
was
born
many
centuries
ago
like
other
contrivances
and
discoveries
it
was
effected
step
by
man
transmitting
the
result
of
his
labours
at
the
time
apparently
useless
to
his
successors
who
took
it
up
and
carried
it
forward
another
stage
prosecution
of
the
inquiry
extending
over
many
generations
thus
the
idea
promulgated
by
hero
of
alexandria
was
never
altogether
lost
but
like
the
grain
of
wheat
hid
in
the
hand
of
the
egyptian
mummy
it
sprouted
and
again
grew
vigorously
when
brought
into
the
full
light
of
modern
science
the
was
nothing
however
until
it
emerged
from
the
state
of
theory
and
was
taken
in
hand
by
practical
mechanics
and
what
a
noble
story
of
patient
laborious
investigation
of
difficulties
encountered
and
overcome
by
heroic
industry
does
not
that
marvellous
machine
tell
of
it
is
indeed
in
itself
a
monument
of
the
power
of
in
man
grouped
around
it
we
find
savary
the
military
engineer
newcomen
the
dartmouth
blacksmith
cawley
the
glazier
potter
the
smeaton
the
civil
engineer
and
towering
above
all
the
laborious
patient
james
watt
the
maker
watt
was
one
of
the
most
industrious
of
men
and
the
story
of
his
life
proves
what
all
experience
confirms
that
it
is
not
the
man
of
the
greatest
natural
vigour
and
capacity
who
achieves
the
highest
results
but
he
who
employs
his
powers
with
the
greatest
industry
and
the
most
carefully
disciplined
skill
that
comes
by
labour
application
and
experience
many
men
in
his
time
knew
far
more
than
watt
but
none
laboured
so
assiduously
as
he
did
to
turn
all
that
he
did
know
to
useful
practical
purposes
he
was
above
all
things
most
persevering
in
the
pursuit
of
facts
he
cultivated
carefully
that
habit
of
active
attention
on
which
all
the
higher
working
qualities
of
the
mind
mainly
depend
indeed
edgeworth
entertained
the
opinion
that
the
difference
of
intellect
in
men
depends
more
upon
the
early
cultivation
of
this
of
than
upon
any
great
disparity
between
the
powers
of
one
individual
and
another
even
when
a
boy
watt
found
science
in
his
toys
the
quadrants
lying
about
his
father
s
carpenter
s
shop
led
him
to
the
study
of
optics
and
astronomy
his
ill
health
induced
him
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
physiology
and
his
solitary
walks
through
the
country
attracted
him
to
the
study
of
botany
and
history
while
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
maker
he
received
an
order
to
build
an
organ
and
though
without
an
ear
for
music
he
undertook
the
study
of
harmonics
and
successfully
constructed
the
instrument
and
in
like
manner
when
the
little
model
of
newcomen
s
belonging
to
the
university
of
glasgow
was
placed
in
his
hands
to
repair
he
forthwith
set
himself
to
learn
all
that
was
then
known
about
heat
evaporation
and
condensation
the
same
time
plodding
his
way
in
mechanics
and
the
science
of
construction
results
of
which
he
at
length
embodied
in
his
condensing
for
ten
years
he
went
on
contriving
and
little
hope
to
cheer
him
and
with
few
friends
to
encourage
him
he
went
on
meanwhile
earning
bread
for
his
family
by
making
and
selling
quadrants
making
and
mending
fiddles
flutes
and
musical
instruments
measuring
surveying
roads
superintending
the
construction
of
canals
or
doing
anything
that
turned
up
and
offered
a
prospect
of
honest
gain
at

watt
found
a
fit
partner
in
another
eminent
leader
of
boulton
of
birmingham
a
skilful
energetic
and
man
who
vigorously
undertook
the
enterprise
of
introducing
the
into
general
use
as
a
working
power
and
the
success
of
both
is
now
matter
of
history
many
skilful
inventors
have
from
time
to
time
added
new
power
to
the
and
by
numerous
modifications
rendered
it
capable
of
being
applied
to
nearly
all
the
purposes
of
machinery
impelling
ships
grinding
corn
printing
books
stamping
money
hammering
planing
and
turning
iron
in
short
of
performing
every
description
of
mechanical
labour
where
power
is
required
one
of
the
most
useful
modifications
in
the
engine
was
that
devised
by
trevithick
and
eventually
perfected
by
george
stephenson
and
his
son
in
the
form
of
the
railway
locomotive
by
which
social
changes
of
immense
importance
have
been
brought
about
of
even
greater
consequence
considered
in
their
results
on
human
progress
and
civilization
than
the
of
watt
one
of
the
first
grand
results
of
watt
s
invention

an
almost
unlimited
power
at
the
command
of
the
producing
classes
the
establishment
of
the
the
person
most
closely
identified
with
the
foundation
of
this
great
branch
of
industry
was
unquestionably
sir
richard
arkwright
whose
practical
energy
and
sagacity
were
perhaps
even
more
remarkable
than
his
mechanical
inventiveness
his
originality
as
an
inventor
has
indeed
been
called
in
question
like
that
of
watt
and
stephenson
arkwright
probably
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
the
that
watt
did
to
the
and
stephenson
to
the
locomotive
he
gathered
together
the
scattered
threads
of
ingenuity
which
already
existed
and
wove
them
after
his
own
design
into
a
new
and
original
fabric
though
lewis
paul
of
birmingham
patented
the
invention
of
spinning
by
rollers
thirty
years
before
arkwright
the
machines
constructed
by
him
were
so
imperfect
in
their
details
that
they
could
not
be
profitably
worked
and
the
invention
was
practically
a
failure
another
obscure
mechanic
a
of
leigh
named
thomas
highs
is
also
said
to
have
invented
the
and
but
they
too
proved
unsuccessful
when
the
demands
of
industry
are
found
to
press
upon
the
resources
of
inventors
the
same
idea
is
usually
found
floating
about
in
many
minds
has
been
the
case
with
the
the
the
electric
telegraph
and
other
inventions
many
ingenious
minds
are
found
labouring
in
the
throes
of
invention
until
at
length
the
master
mind
the
strong
practical
man
steps
forward
and
straightway
delivers
them
of
their
idea
applies
the
principle
successfully
and
the
thing
is
done
then
there
is
a
loud
outcry
among
all
the
smaller
contrivers
who
see
themselves
distanced
in
the
race
and
hence
men
such
as
watt
stephenson
and
arkwright
have
usually
to
defend
their
reputation
and
their
rights
as
practical
and
successful
inventors
richard
arkwright
like
most
of
our
great
mechanicians
sprang
from
the
ranks
he
was
born
in
preston
in
his
parents
were
very
poor
and
he
was
the
youngest
of
thirteen
children
he
was
never
at
school
the
only
education
he
received
he
gave
to
himself
and
to
the
last
he
was
only
able
to
write
with
difficulty
when
a
boy
he
was
apprenticed
to
a
barber
and
after
learning
the
business
he
set
up
for
himself
in
bolton
where
he
occupied
an
underground
cellar
over
which
he
put
up
the
sign
come
to
the
subterraneous
shaves
for
a
the
other
barbers
found
their
customers
leaving
them
and
reduced
their
prices
to
his
standard
when
arkwright
determined
to
push
his
trade
announced
his
determination
to
give
a
clean
shave
for
a
after
a
few
years
he
quitted
his
cellar
and
became
an
itinerant
dealer
in
hair
at
that
time
wigs
were
worn
and
formed
an
important
branch
of
the
barbering
business
arkwright
went
about
buying
hair
for
the
wigs
he
was
accustomed
to
attend
the
hiring
fairs
throughout
lancashire
resorted
to
by
young
women
for
the
purpose
of
securing
their
long
tresses
and
it
is
said
that
in
negotiations
of
this
sort
he
was
very
successful
he
also
dealt
in
a
chemical
hair
dye
which
he
used
adroitly
and
thereby
secured
a
considerable
trade
but
he
does
not
seem
notwithstanding
his
pushing
character
to
have
done
more
than
earn
a
bare
living
the
fashion
of
having
undergone
a
change
distress
fell
upon
the
and
arkwright
being
of
a
mechanical
turn
was
consequently
induced
to
turn
machine
inventor
or
conjurer
as
the
pursuit
was
then
popularly
termed
many
attempts
were
made
about
that
time
to
invent
a
and
our
barber
determined
to
launch
his
little
bark
on
the
sea
of
invention
with
the
rest
like
other
men
of
the
same
bias
he
had
already
been
devoting
his
spare
time
to
the
invention
of
a
machine
and
from
that
the
transition
to
a
was
easy
he
followed
his
experiments
so
assiduously
that
he
neglected
his
business
lost
the
little
money
he
had
saved
and
was
reduced
to
great
poverty
his
he
had
by
this
time
impatient
at
what
she
conceived
to
be
a
wanton
waste
of
time
and
money
and
in
a
moment
of
sudden
wrath
she
seized
upon
and
destroyed
his
models
hoping
thus
to
remove
the
cause
of
the
family
privations
arkwright
was
a
stubborn
and
enthusiastic
man
and
he
was
provoked
beyond
measure
by
this
conduct
of
his
wife
from
whom
he
immediately
separated
in
travelling
about
the
country
arkwright
had
become
acquainted
with
a
person
named
kay
a
clockmaker
at
warrington
who
assisted
him
in
constructing
some
of
the
parts
of
his
machinery
it
is
supposed
that
he
was
informed
by
kay
of
the
principle
of
spinning
by
rollers
but
it
is
also
said
that
the
idea
was
first
suggested
to
him
by
accidentally
observing
a
piece
of
iron
become
elongated
by
passing
between
iron
rollers
however
this
may
be
the
idea
at
once
took
firm
possession
of
his
mind
and
he
proceeded
to
devise
the
process
by
which
it
was
to
be
accomplished
kay
being
able
to
tell
him
nothing
on
this
point
arkwright
now
abandoned
his
business
of
hair
collecting
and
devoted
himself
to
the
perfecting
of
his
machine
a
model
of
which
constructed
by
kay
under
his
directions
he
set
up
in
the
parlour
of
the
free
grammar
school
at
preston
being
a
burgess
of
the
town
he
voted
at
the
contested
election
at
which
general
burgoyne
was
returned
but
such
was
his
poverty
and
such
the
tattered
state
of
his
dress
that
a
number
of
persons
subscribed
a
sum
sufficient
to
have
him
put
in
a
state
fit
to
appear
in
the
the
exhibition
of
his
machine
in
a
town
where
so
many
workpeople
lived
by
the
exercise
of
manual
labour
proved
a
dangerous
experiment
ominous
growlings
were
heard
outside
the
from
time
to
time
and
arkwright
the
fate
of
kay
who
was
mobbed
and
compelled
to
fly
from
lancashire
because
of
his
invention
of
the
and
of
poor
hargreaves
whose
had
been
pulled
to
pieces
only
a
short
time
before
by
a
blackburn
mob
determined
on
packing
up
his
model
and
removing
to
a
less
dangerous
locality
he
went
accordingly
to
nottingham
where
he
applied
to
some
of
the
local
bankers
for
pecuniary
assistance
and
the
wright
consented
to
advance
him
a
sum
of
money
on
condition
of
sharing
in
the
profits
of
the
invention
the
machine
however
not
being
perfected
so
soon
as
they
had
anticipated
the
bankers
recommended
arkwright
to
apply
to
strutt
and
need
the
former
of
whom
was
the
ingenious
inventor
and
patentee
of
the
strutt
at
once
appreciated
the
merits
of
the
invention
and
a
partnership
was
entered
into
with
arkwright
whose
road
to
fortune
was
now
clear
the
patent
was
secured
in
the
name
of
richard
arkwright
of
nottingham
clockmaker
and
it
is
a
circumstance
worthy
of
note
that
it
was
taken
out
in
the
same
year
in
which
watt
secured
the
patent
for
his
a
was
first
erected
at
nottingham
driven
by
horses
and
another
was
shortly
after
built
on
a
much
larger
scale
at
cromford
in
derbyshire
turned
by
a
from
which
circumstance
the
came
to
be
called
the
arkwright
s
labours
however
were
comparatively
speaking
only
begun
he
had
still
to
perfect
all
the
working
details
of
his
machine
it
was
in
his
hands
the
subject
of
constant
modification
and
improvement
until
eventually
it
was
rendered
practicable
and
profitable
in
an
eminent
degree
but
success
was
only
secured
by
long
and
patient
labour
for
some
years
indeed
the
speculation
was
disheartening
and
unprofitable
swallowing
up
a
very
large
amount
of
capital
without
any
result
when
success
began
to
appear
more
certain
then
the
lancashire
manufacturers
fell
upon
arkwright
s
patent
to
pull
it
in
pieces
as
the
cornish
miners
fell
upon
boulton
and
watt
to
rob
them
of
the
profits
of
their
arkwright
was
even
denounced
as
the
enemy
of
the
working
people
and
a
mill
which
he
built
near
chorley
was
destroyed
by
a
mob
in
the
presence
of
a
strong
force
of
police
and
military
the
lancashire
men
refused
to
buy
his
materials
though
they
were
confessedly
the
best
in
the
market
then
they
refused
to
pay
for
the
use
of
his
machines
and
combined
to
crush
him
in
the
courts
of
law
to
the
disgust
of
people
arkwright
s
patent
was
upset
after
the
trial
when
passing
the
hotel
at
which
his
opponents
were
staying
one
of
them
said
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
him
well
we
ve
done
the
old
shaver
at
last
to
which
he
coolly
replied
never
mind
i
ve
a
razor
left
that
will
shave
you
he
established
new
mills
in
lancashire
derbyshire
and
at
new
lanark
in
scotland
the
mills
at
cromford
also
came
into
his
hands
at
the
expiry
of
his
partnership
with
strutt
and
the
amount
and
the
excellence
of
his
products
were
such
that
in
a
short
time
he
obtained
so
complete
a
control
of
the
trade
that
the
prices
were
fixed
by
him
and
he
governed
the
main
operations
of
the
other
arkwright
was
a
man
of
great
force
of
character
indomitable
courage
much
worldly
shrewdness
with
a
business
faculty
almost
amounting
to
genius
at
one
period
his
time
was
engrossed
by
severe
and
continuous
labour
occasioned
by
the
organising
and
conducting
of
his
numerous
manufactories
sometimes
from
four
in
the
morning
till
nine
at
night
at
fifty
years
of
age
he
set
to
work
to
learn
english
grammar
and
improve
himself
in
writing
and
orthography
after
overcoming
every
obstacle
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
reaping
the
reward
of
his
enterprise
eighteen
years
after
he
had
constructed
his
first
machine
he
rose
to
such
estimation
in
derbyshire
that
he
was
appointed
high
sheriff
of
the
county
and
shortly
after
george
iii
conferred
upon
him
the
honour
of
knighthood
he
died
in
be
it
for
good
or
for
evil
arkwright
was
the
founder
in
england
of
the
modern
factory
system
a
branch
of
industry
which
has
unquestionably
proved
a
source
of
immense
wealth
to
individuals
and
to
the
nation
all
the
other
great
branches
of
industry
in
britain
furnish
like
examples
of
energetic
men
of
business
the
source
of
much
benefit
to
the
neighbourhoods
in
which
they
have
laboured
and
of
increased
power
and
wealth
to
the
community
at
large
amongst
such
might
be
cited
the
strutts
of
belper
the
tennants
of
glasgow
the
marshalls
and
gotts
of
leeds
the
peels
ashworths
birleys
fieldens
ashtons
heywoods
and
ainsworths
of
south
lancashire
some
of
whose
descendants
have
since
become
distinguished
in
connection
with
the
political
history
of
england
such
were
the
peels
of
south
lancashire
the
founder
of
the
peel
family
about
the
middle
of
last
century
was
a
small
yeoman
occupying
the
hole
house
farm
near
blackburn
from
which
he
afterwards
removed
to
a
house
situated
in
fish
lane
in
that
town
robert
peel
as
he
advanced
in
life
saw
a
large
family
of
sons
and
daughters
growing
up
about
him
but
the
land
about
blackburn
being
somewhat
barren
it
did
not
appear
to
him
that
agricultural
pursuits
offered
a
very
encouraging
prospect
for
their
industry
the
place
had
however
long
been
the
seat
of
a
domestic
fabric
called
blackburn
greys
consisting
of
linen
weft
and
cotton
warp
being
chiefly
made
in
that
town
and
its
neighbourhood
it
was
then
to
the
introduction
of
the
factory
industrious
yeomen
with
families
to
employ
the
time
not
occupied
in
the
fields
in
weaving
at
home
and
robert
peel
accordingly
began
the
domestic
trade
of
he
was
honest
and
made
an
honest
article
thrifty
and
hardworking
and
his
trade
prospered
he
was
also
enterprising
and
was
one
of
the
first
to
adopt
the
carding
cylinder
then
recently
invented
but
robert
peel
s
attention
was
principally
directed
to
the
of
a
comparatively
unknown
for
some
time
he
carried
on
a
series
of
experiments
with
the
object
of
printing
by
machinery
the
experiments
were
secretly
conducted
in
his
own
house
the
cloth
being
ironed
for
the
purpose
by
one
of
the
women
of
the
family
it
was
then
customary
in
such
houses
as
the
peels
to
use
pewter
plates
at
dinner
having
sketched
a
figure
or
pattern
on
one
of
the
plates
the
thought
struck
him
that
an
impression
might
be
got
from
it
in
reverse
and
printed
on
calico
with
colour
in
a
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
lived
a
woman
who
kept
a
calendering
machine
and
going
into
her
cottage
he
put
the
plate
with
colour
rubbed
into
the
figured
part
and
some
calico
over
it
through
the
machine
when
it
was
found
to
leave
a
satisfactory
impression
such
is
said
to
have
been
the
origin
of
roller
printing
on
calico
robert
peel
shortly
perfected
his
process
and
the
first
pattern
he
brought
out
was
a
parsley
leaf
hence
he
is
spoken
of
in
the
neighbourhood
of
blackburn
to
this
day
as
parsley
the
process
of
calico
printing
by
what
is
called
the
mule
is
by
means
of
a
wooden
cylinder
in
relief
with
an
engraved
copper
afterwards
brought
to
perfection
by
one
of
his
sons
the
head
of
the
firm
of
peel
and
of
church
stimulated
by
his
success
robert
peel
shortly
gave
up
farming
and
removing
to
brookside
a
village
about
two
miles
from
blackburn
he
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
the
printing
business
there
with
the
aid
of
his
sons
who
were
as
energetic
as
himself
he
successfully
carried
on
the
trade
for
several
years
and
as
the
young
men
grew
up
towards
manhood
the
concern
branched
out
into
various
firms
of
peels
each
of
which
became
a
centre
of
industrial
activity
and
a
source
of
remunerative
employment
to
large
numbers
of
people
from
what
can
now
be
learnt
of
the
character
of
the
original
and
untitled
robert
peel
he
must
have
been
a
remarkable
sagacious
and
but
little
is
known
of
him
excepting
from
traditions
and
the
sons
of
those
who
knew
him
are
fast
passing
away
his
son
sir
robert
thus
modestly
spoke
of
him
my
father
may
be
truly
said
to
have
been
the
founder
of
our
family
and
he
so
accurately
appreciated
the
importance
of
commercial
wealth
in
a
national
point
of
view
that
he
was
often
heard
to
say
that
the
gains
to
individuals
were
small
compared
with
the
national
gains
arising
from
sir
robert
peel
the
first
baronet
and
the
second
manufacturer
of
the
name
inherited
all
his
father
s
enterprise
ability
and
industry
his
position
at
starting
in
life
was
little
above
that
of
an
ordinary
working
man
for
his
father
though
laying
the
foundations
of
future
prosperity
was
still
struggling
with
the
difficulties
arising
from
insufficient
capital
when
robert
was
only
twenty
years
of
age
he
determined
to
begin
the
business
of
which
he
had
by
this
time
learnt
from
his
father
on
his
own
account
his
uncle
james
haworth
and
william
yates
of
blackburn
joined
him
in
his
enterprise
the
whole
capital
which
they
could
raise
amongst
them
amounting
to
only
about
the
principal
part
of
which
was
supplied
by
william
yates
the
father
of
the
latter
was
a
householder
in
blackburn
where
he
was
well
known
and
much
respected
and
having
saved
money
by
his
business
he
was
willing
to
advance
sufficient
to
give
his
son
a
start
in
the
lucrative
trade
of
then
in
its
infancy
robert
peel
though
comparatively
a
mere
youth
supplied
the
practical
knowledge
of
the
business
but
it
was
said
of
him
and
proved
true
that
he
carried
an
old
head
on
young
a
ruined
with
its
adjoining
fields
was
purchased
for
a
comparatively
small
sum
near
the
then
insignificant
town
of
bury
where
the
works
long
after
continued
to
be
known
as
the
ground
and
a
few
wooden
sheds
having
been
run
up
the
firm
commenced
their
business
in
a
very
humble
way
in
the
year
adding
to
it
that
of
a
few
years
later
the
frugal
style
in
which
the
partners
lived
may
be
inferred
from
the
following
incident
in
their
early
career
william
yates
being
a
married
man
with
a
family
commenced
housekeeping
on
a
small
scale
and
to
oblige
peel
who
was
single
he
agreed
to
take
him
as
a
lodger
the
sum
which
the
latter
first
paid
for
board
and
lodging
was
only
a
week
but
yates
considering
this
too
little
insisted
on
the
weekly
payment
being
increased
a
shilling
to
which
peel
at
first
demurred
and
a
difference
between
the
partners
took
place
which
was
eventually
compromised
by
the
lodger
paying
an
advance
of
sixpence
a
week
william
yates
s
eldest
child
was
a
girl
named
ellen
and
she
very
soon
became
an
especial
favourite
with
the
young
lodger
on
returning
from
his
hard
day
s
work
at
the
ground
he
would
take
the
little
girl
upon
his
knee
and
say
to
her
nelly
thou
bonny
little
dear
wilt
be
my
wife
to
which
the
child
would
readily
answer
yes
as
any
child
would
do
then
i
ll
wait
for
thee
nelly
i
ll
wed
thee
and
none
and
robert
peel
did
wait
as
the
girl
grew
in
beauty
towards
womanhood
his
determination
to
wait
for
her
was
strengthened
and
after
the
lapse
of
ten
of
close
application
to
business
and
rapidly
increasing
peel
married
ellen
yates
when
she
had
completed
her
seventeenth
year
and
the
pretty
child
whom
her
mother
s
lodger
and
father
s
partner
had
nursed
upon
his
knee
became
peel
and
eventually
lady
peel
the
mother
of
the
future
prime
minister
of
england
lady
peel
was
a
noble
and
beautiful
woman
fitted
to
grace
any
station
in
life
she
possessed
rare
powers
of
mind
and
was
on
every
emergency
the
and
faithful
counsellor
of
her
husband
for
many
years
after
their
marriage
she
acted
as
his
amanuensis
conducting
the
principal
part
of
his
business
correspondence
for
peel
himself
was
an
indifferent
and
almost
unintelligible
writer
she
died
in
only
three
years
after
the
baronetcy
had
been
conferred
upon
her
husband
it
is
said
that
london
fashionable
unlike
what
she
had
been
accustomed
to
at
injurious
to
her
health
and
old
yates
afterwards
used
to
say
if
robert
hadn
t
made
our
nelly
a
lady
she
might
ha
been
living
the
career
of
yates
peel
was
throughout
one
of
great
and
uninterrupted
prosperity
sir
robert
peel
himself
was
the
soul
of
the
firm
to
great
energy
and
application
uniting
much
practical
sagacity
and
mercantile
in
which
many
of
the
early
were
exceedingly
deficient
he
was
a
man
of
iron
mind
and
frame
and
toiled
unceasingly
in
short
he
was
to
cotton
printing
what
arkwright
was
to
and
his
success
was
equally
great
the
excellence
of
the
articles
produced
by
the
firm
secured
the
command
of
the
market
and
the
character
of
the

stood
in
lancashire
besides
greatly
benefiting
bury
the
partnership
planted
similar
extensive
works
in
the
neighbourhood
on
the
irwell
and
the
roch
and
it
was
cited
to
their
honour
that
while
they
sought
to
raise
to
the
highest
perfection
the
quality
of
their
manufactures
they
also
endeavoured
in
all
ways
to
promote
the
and
comfort
of
their
workpeople
for
whom
they
contrived
to
provide
remunerative
employment
even
in
the
least
prosperous
times
sir
robert
peel
readily
appreciated
the
value
of
all
new
processes
and
inventions
in
illustration
of
which
we
may
allude
to
his
adoption
of
the
process
for
producing
what
is
called
in
calico
printing
this
is
accomplished
by
the
use
of
a
paste
or
resist
on
such
parts
of
the
cloth
as
were
intended
to
remain
white
the
person
who
discovered
the
paste
was
a
traveller
for
a
london
house
who
sold
it
to
peel
for
an
inconsiderable
sum
it
required
the
experience
of
a
year
or
two
to
perfect
the
system
and
make
it
practically
useful
but
the
beauty
of
its
effect
and
the
extreme
precision
of
outline
in
the
pattern
produced
at
once
placed
the
bury
establishment
at
the
head
of
all
the
factories
for
calico
printing
in
the
country
other
firms
conducted
with
like
spirit
were
established
by
members
of
the
same
family
at
burnley
foxhill
bank
and
altham
in
lancashire
salley
abbey
in
yorkshire
and
afterwards
at
in
staffordshire
these
various
establishments
whilst
they
brought
wealth
to
their
proprietors
setting
an
example
to
the
whole
cotton
trade
and
training
up
many
of
the
most
successful
printers
and
manufacturers
in
lancashire
among
other
distinguished
founders
of
industry
the
rev
william
lee
inventor
of
the
stocking
frame
and
john
heathcoat
inventor
of
the
machine
are
worthy
of
notice
as
men
of
great
mechanical
skill
and
perseverance
through
whose
labours
a
vast
amount
of
remunerative
employment
has
been
provided
for
the
labouring
population
of
nottingham
and
the
adjacent
districts
the
accounts
which
have
been
preserved
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
invention
of
the
stocking
frame
are
very
confused
and
in
many
respects
contradictory
though
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
name
of
the
inventor
this
was
william
lee
born
at
woodborough
a
village
some
seven
miles
from
nottingham
about
the
year
according
to
some
accounts
he
was
the
heir
to
a
small
freehold
while
according
to
others
he
was
a
poor
scholar
and
had
to
struggle
with
poverty
from
his
earliest
years
he
entered
as
a
sizar
at
christ
college
cambridge
in
may
and
subsequently
removed
to
john
s
taking
his
degree
of
in
it
is
believed
that
he
commenced
in
but
on
this
point
there
appears
to
be
some
confusion
in
the
records
of
the
university
the
statement
usually
made
that
he
was
expelled
for
marrying
contrary
to
the
statutes
is
incorrect
as
he
was
never
a
fellow
of
the
university
and
therefore
could
not
be
prejudiced
by
taking
such
a
step
at
the
time
when
lee
invented
the
stocking
frame
he
was
officiating
as
curate
of
calverton
near
nottingham
and
it
is
alleged
by
some
writers
that
the
invention
had
its
origin
in
disappointed
affection
the
curate
is
said
to
have
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
a
young
lady
of
the
village
who
failed
to
reciprocate
his
affections
and
when
he
visited
her
she
was
accustomed
to
pay
much
more
attention
to
the
process
of
knitting
stockings
and
instructing
her
pupils
in
the
art
than
to
the
addresses
of
her
admirer
this
slight
is
said
to
have
created
in
his
mind
such
an
aversion
to
knitting
by
hand
that
he
formed
the
determination
to
invent
a
machine
that
should
supersede
it
and
render
it
a
gainless
employment
for
three
years
he
devoted
himself
to
the
prosecution
of
the
invention
sacrificing
everything
to
his
new
idea
at
the
prospect
of
success
opened
before
him
he
abandoned
his
curacy
and
devoted
himself
to
the
art
of
stocking
making
by
machinery
this
is
the
version
of
the
story
given
by
henson
on
the
authority
of
an
old
who
died
in
collins
s
hospital
nottingham
aged
and
was
apprenticed
in
the
town
during
the
reign
of
queen
anne
it
is
also
given
by
deering
and
blackner
as
the
traditional
account
in
the
neighbourhood
and
it
is
in
some
measure
borne
out
by
the
arms
of
the
london
company
of
knitters
which
consists
of
a
stocking
frame
without
the
with
a
clergyman
on
one
side
and
a
woman
on
the
other
as
supporters
whatever
may
have
been
the
actual
facts
as
to
the
origin
of
the
invention
of
the
stocking
loom
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
extraordinary
mechanical
genius
displayed
by
its
inventor
that
a
clergyman
living
in
a
remote
village
whose
life
had
for
the
most
part
been
spent
with
books
should
contrive
a
machine
of
such
delicate
and
complicated
movements
and
at
once
advance
the
art
of
knitting
from
the
tedious
process
of
linking
threads
in
a
chain
of
loops
by
three
skewers
in
the
fingers
of
a
woman
to
the
beautiful
and
rapid
process
of
weaving
by
the
stocking
frame
was
indeed
an
astonishing
achievement
which
may
be
pronounced
almost
unequalled
in
the
history
of
mechanical
invention
lee
s
merit
was
all
the
greater
as
the
handicraft
arts
were
then
in
their
infancy
and
little
attention
had
as
yet
been
given
to
the
contrivance
of
machinery
for
the
purposes
of
manufacture
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
extemporising
the
parts
of
his
machine
as
he
best
could
and
adopting
various
expedients
to
overcome
difficulties
as
they
arose
his
tools
were
imperfect
and
his
materials
imperfect
and
he
had
no
skilled
workmen
to
assist
him
according
to
tradition
the
first
frame
he
made
was
a
twelve
gauge
without
lead
sinkers
and
it
was
almost
wholly
of
wood
the
needles
being
also
stuck
in
bits
of
wood
one
of
lee
s
principal
difficulties
consisted
in
the
formation
of
the
stitch
for
want
of
needle
eyes
but
this
he
eventually
overcame
by
forming
eyes
to
the
needles
with
a
file
at
length
one
difficulty
after
another
was
successfully
overcome
and
after
three
years
labour
the
machine
was
sufficiently
complete
to
be
fit
for
use
the
quondam
curate
full
of
enthusiasm
for
his
art
now
began
stocking
weaving
in
the
village
of
calverton
and
he
continued
to
work
there
for
several
years
instructing
his
brother
james
and
several
of
his
relations
in
the
practice
of
the
art
having
brought
his
frame
to
a
considerable
degree
of
perfection
and
being
desirous
of
securing
the
patronage
of
queen
elizabeth
whose
partiality
for
knitted
silk
stockings
was
well
known
lee
proceeded
to
london
to
exhibit
the
loom
before
her
majesty
he
first
showed
it
to
several
members
of
the
court
among
others
to
sir
william
afterwards
lord
hunsdon
whom
he
taught
to
work
it
with
success
and
lee
was
through
their
instrumentality
at
length
admitted
to
an
interview
with
the
queen
and
worked
the
machine
in
her
presence
elizabeth
however
did
not
give
him
the
encouragement
that
he
had
expected
and
she
is
said
to
have
opposed
the
invention
on
the
ground
that
it
was
calculated
to
deprive
a
large
number
of
poor
people
of
their
employment
of
hand
knitting
lee
was
no
more
successful
in
finding
other
patrons
and
considering
himself
and
his
invention
treated
with
contempt
he
embraced
the
offer
made
to
him
by
sully
the
sagacious
minister
of
henry
to
proceed
to
rouen
and
instruct
the
operatives
of
that
one
of
the
most
important
manufacturing
centres
of
the
construction
and
use
of
the
lee
accordingly
transferred
himself
and
his
machines
to
france
in
taking
with
him
his
brother
and
seven
workmen
he
met
with
a
cordial
reception
at
rouen
and
was
proceeding
with
the
manufacture
of
stockings
on
a
large
nine
of
his
frames
in
full
work
unhappily
ill
fortune
again
overtook
him
henry
his
protector
on
whom
he
had
relied
for
the
rewards
honours
and
promised
grant
of
privileges
which
had
induced
lee
to
settle
in
france
was
murdered
by
the
fanatic
ravaillac
and
the
encouragement
and
protection
which
had
heretofore
been
extended
to
him
were
at
once
withdrawn
to
press
his
claims
at
court
lee
proceeded
to
paris
but
being
a
protestant
as
well
as
a
foreigner
his
representations
were
treated
with
neglect
and
worn
out
with
vexation
and
grief
this
distinguished
inventor
shortly
after
died
at
paris
in
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
and
distress
lee
s
brother
with
seven
of
the
workmen
succeeded
in
escaping
from
france
with
their
frames
leaving
two
behind
on
james
lee
s
return
to
nottinghamshire
he
was
joined
by
one
ashton
a
miller
of
thoroton
who
had
been
instructed
in
the
art
of
knitting
by
the
inventor
himself
before
he
left
england
these
two
with
the
workmen
and
their
frames
began
the
stocking
manufacture
at
thoroton
and
carried
it
on
with
considerable
success
the
place
was
favourably
situated
for
the
purpose
as
the
sheep
pastured
in
the
neighbouring
district
of
sherwood
yielded
a
kind
of
wool
of
the
longest
staple
ashton
is
said
to
have
introduced
the
method
of
making
the
frames
with
lead
sinkers
which
was
a
great
improvement
the
number
of
looms
employed
in
different
parts
of
england
gradually
increased
and
the
machine
manufacture
of
stockings
eventually
became
an
important
branch
of
the
national
industry
one
of
the
most
important
modifications
in
the
was
that
which
enabled
it
to
be
applied
to
the
manufacture
of
lace
on
a
large
scale
in
two
workmen
frost
and
holmes
were
both
engaged
in
making
by
means
of
the
modifications
they
had
introduced
in
the
and
in
the
course
of
about
thirty
years
so
rapid
was
the
growth
of
this
branch
of
production
that
frames
were
at
work
giving
employment
to
upwards
of
people
owing
however
to
the
war
to
change
of
fashion
and
to
other
circumstances
the
nottingham
lace
manufacture
rapidly
fell
off
and
it
continued
in
a
decaying
state
until
the
invention
of
the
machine
by
john
heathcoat
late
for
tiverton
which
had
the
effect
of
at
once
the
manufacture
on
solid
foundations
john
heathcoat
was
the
youngest
son
of
a
respectable
small
farmer
at
duffield
derbyshire
where
he
was
born
in
when
at
school
he
made
steady
and
rapid
progress
but
was
early
removed
from
it
to
be
apprenticed
to
a
near
loughborough
the
boy
soon
learnt
to
handle
tools
with
dexterity
and
he
acquired
a
minute
knowledge
of
the
parts
of
which
the
was
composed
as
well
as
of
the
more
intricate
at
his
leisure
he
studied
how
to
introduce
improvements
in
them
and
his
friend
bazley
states
that
as
early
as
the
age
of
sixteen
he
conceived
the
idea
of
inventing
a
machine
by
which
lace
might
be
made
similar
to
buckingham
or
french
lace
then
all
made
by
hand
the
first
practical
improvement
he
succeeded
in
introducing
was
in
the
when
by
means
of
an
ingenious
apparatus
he
succeeded
in
producing
mitts
of
a
lacy
appearance
and
it
was
this
success
which
determined
him
to
pursue
the
study
of
mechanical
the
had
already
in
a
modified
form
been
applied
to
the
manufacture
of
lace
in
which
the
mesh
was
as
in
a
stocking
but
the
work
was
slight
and
frail
and
therefore
unsatisfactory
many
ingenious
nottingham
mechanics
had
during
a
long
succession
of
years
been
labouring
at
the
problem
of
inventing
a
machine
by
which
the
mesh
of
threads
should
be
round
each
other
on
the
formation
of
the
net
some
of
these
men
died
in
poverty
some
were
driven
insane
and
all
alike
failed
in
the
object
of
their
search
the
old
held
its
ground
when
a
little
over
years
of
age
heathcoat
went
to
nottingham
where
he
readily
found
employment
for
which
he
soon
received
the
highest
remuneration
as
a
of
hosiery
and
and
was
much
respected
for
his
talent
for
invention
general
intelligence
and
the
sound
and
sober
principles
that
governed
his
conduct
he
also
continued
to
pursue
the
subject
on
which
his
mind
had
before
been
occupied
and
laboured
to
compass
the
contrivance
of
a
twist
machine
he
first
studied
the
art
of
making
the
buckingham
or
by
hand
with
the
object
of
effecting
the
same
motions
by
mechanical
means
it
was
a
long
and
laborious
task
requiring
the
exercise
of
great
perseverance
and
ingenuity
his
master
elliot
described
him
at
that
time
as
inventive
patient
and
taciturn
undaunted
by
failures
and
mistakes
full
of
resources
and
expedients
and
entertaining
the
most
perfect
confidence
that
his
application
of
mechanical
principles
would
eventually
be
crowned
with
success
it
is
difficult
to
describe
in
words
an
invention
so
complicated
as
the
machine
it
was
indeed
a
mechanical
pillow
for
making
lace
imitating
in
an
ingenious
manner
the
motions
of
the
s
fingers
in
intersecting
or
tying
the
meshes
of
the
lace
upon
her
pillow
on
analysing
the
component
parts
of
a
piece
of
lace
heathcoat
was
enabled
to
classify
the
threads
into
longitudinal
and
diagonal
he
began
his
experiments
by
fixing
common
lengthwise
on
a
sort
of
frame
for
the
warp
and
then
passing
the
weft
threads
between
them
by
common
plyers
delivering
them
to
other
plyers
on
the
opposite
side
then
after
giving
them
a
sideways
motion
and
twist
the
threads
were
repassed
back
between
the
next
adjoining
cords
the
meshes
being
thus
tied
in
the
same
way
as
upon
pillows
by
hand
he
had
then
to
contrive
a
mechanism
that
should
accomplish
all
these
nice
and
delicate
movements
and
to
do
this
cost
him
no
small
amount
of
mental
toil
long
after
he
said
the
single
difficulty
of
getting
the
diagonal
threads
to
twist
in
the
allotted
space
was
so
great
that
if
it
had
now
to
be
done
i
should
probably
not
attempt
its
his
next
step
was
to
provide
thin
metallic
discs
to
be
used
as
bobbins
for
conducting
the
threads
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
warp
these
discs
being
arranged
in
placed
on
each
side
of
the
warp
were
moved
by
suitable
machinery
so
as
to
conduct
the
threads
from
side
to
side
in
forming
the
lace
he
eventually
succeeded
in
working
out
his
principle
with
extraordinary
skill
and
success
and
at
the
age
of
he
was
enabled
to
secure
his
invention
by
a
patent
during
this
time
his
wife
was
kept
in
almost
as
great
anxiety
as
himself
for
she
well
knew
of
his
trials
and
difficulties
while
he
was
striving
to
perfect
his
invention
many
years
after
they
had
been
successfully
overcome
the
conversation
which
took
place
one
eventful
evening
was
vividly
remembered
well
said
the
anxious
wife
will
it
work
no
was
the
sad
answer
i
have
had
to
take
it
all
to
pieces
though
he
could
still
speak
hopefully
and
cheerfully
his
poor
wife
could
restrain
her
feelings
no
longer
but
sat
down
and
cried
bitterly
she
had
however
only
a
few
more
weeks
to
wait
for
success
long
laboured
for
and
richly
deserved
came
at
last
and
a
proud
and
happy
man
was
john
heathcoat
when
he
brought
home
the
first
narrow
strip
of
made
by
his
machine
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
his
wife
as
in
the
case
of
nearly
all
inventions
which
have
proved
productive
heathcoat
s
rights
as
a
patentee
were
disputed
and
his
claims
as
an
inventor
called
in
question
on
the
supposed
invalidity
of
the
patent
the
boldly
adopted
the
machine
and
set
the
inventor
at
defiance
but
other
patents
were
taken
out
for
alleged
improvements
and
adaptations
and
it
was
only
when
these
new
patentees
fell
out
and
went
to
law
with
each
other
that
heathcoat
s
rights
became
established
one
having
brought
an
action
against
another
for
an
alleged
infringement
of
his
patent
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
in
which
the
judge
concurred
on
the
ground
that
the
machines
in
question
were
infringements
of
heathcoat
s
patent
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
this
trial
boville
moore
that
sir
john
copley
afterwards
lord
lyndhurst
who
was
retained
for
the
defence
in
the
interest
of
heathcoat
learnt
to
work
the
machine
in
order
that
he
might
master
the
details
of
the
invention
on
reading
over
his
brief
he
confessed
that
he
did
not
quite
understand
the
merits
of
the
case
but
as
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
one
of
great
importance
he
offered
to
go
down
into
the
country
forthwith
and
study
the
machine
until
he
understood
it
and
then
said
he
i
will
defend
you
to
the
best
of
my
he
accordingly
put
himself
into
that
night
s
mail
and
went
down
to
nottingham
to
get
up
his
case
as
perhaps
counsel
never
got
it
up
before
next
morning
the
learned
sergeant
placed
himself
in
a
and
he
did
not
leave
it
until
he
could
deftly
make
a
piece
of
with
his
own
hands
and
thoroughly
understood
the
principle
as
well
as
the
details
of
the
machine
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial
the
learned
sergeant
was
enabled
to
work
the
model
on
the
table
with
such
case
and
skill
and
to
explain
the
precise
nature
of
the
invention
with
such
felicitous
clearness
as
to
astonish
alike
judge
jury
and
spectators
and
the
thorough
conscientiousness
and
mastery
with
which
he
handled
the
case
had
no
doubt
its
influence
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
after
the
trial
was
over
heathcoat
on
inquiry
found
about
six
hundred
machines
at
work
after
his
patent
and
he
proceeded
to
levy
royalty
upon
the
owners
of
them
which
amounted
to
a
large
sum
but
the
profits
realised
by
the
manufacturers
of
lace
were
very
great
and
the
use
of
the
machines
rapidly
extended
while
the
price
of
the
article
was
reduced
from
five
pounds
the
square
yard
to
about
five
pence
in
the
course
of
years
during
the
same
period
the
average
annual
returns
of
the
have
been
at
least
four
millions
sterling
and
it
gives
remunerative
employment
to
about
workpeople
to
return
to
the
personal
history
of
heathcoat
in
we
find
him
established
as
a
at
loughborough
in
leicestershire
there
he
carried
on
a
prosperous
business
for
several
years
giving
employment
to
a
large
number
of
operatives
at
wages
varying
from
to
a
week
notwithstanding
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
hands
employed
in
through
the
introduction
of
the
new
machines
it
began
to
be
whispered
about
among
the
workpeople
that
they
were
superseding
labour
and
an
extensive
conspiracy
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
them
wherever
found
as
early
as
the
year
disputes
arose
between
the
masters
and
men
engaged
in
the
stocking
and
lace
trades
in
the
parts
of
nottinghamshire
and
the
adjacent
parts
of
derbyshire
and
leicestershire
the
result
of
which
was
the
assembly
of
a
mob
at
sutton
in
ashfield
who
proceeded
in
open
day
to
break
the
stocking
and
of
the
manufacturers
some
of
the
ringleaders
having
been
seized
and
punished
the
disaffected
learnt
caution
but
the
destruction
of
the
machines
was
nevertheless
carried
on
secretly
wherever
a
safe
opportunity
presented
itself
as
the
machines
were
of
so
delicate
a
construction
that
a
single
blow
of
a
hammer
rendered
them
useless
and
as
the
manufacture
was
carried
on
for
the
most
part
in
detached
buildings
often
in
private
dwellings
remote
from
towns
the
opportunities
of
destroying
them
were
unusually
easy
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nottingham
which
was
the
focus
of
turbulence
the
organized
themselves
in
regular
bodies
and
held
nocturnal
meetings
at
which
their
plans
were
arranged
probably
with
the
view
of
inspiring
confidence
they
gave
out
that
they
were
under
the
command
of
a
leader
named
ned
ludd
or
general
ludd
and
hence
their
designation
of
luddites
under
this
organization
was
carried
on
with
great
vigour
during
the
winter
of
occasioning
great
distress
and
throwing
large
numbers
of
workpeople
out
of
employment
meanwhile
the
owners
of
the
frames
proceeded
to
remove
them
from
the
villages
and
lone
dwellings
in
the
country
and
brought
them
into
warehouses
in
the
towns
for
their
better
protection
the
luddites
seem
to
have
been
encouraged
by
the
lenity
of
the
sentences
pronounced
on
such
of
their
confederates
as
had
been
apprehended
and
tried
and
shortly
after
the
mania
broke
out
afresh
and
rapidly
extended
over
the
northern
and
midland
manufacturing
districts
the
organization
became
more
secret
an
oath
was
administered
to
the
members
binding
them
to
obedience
to
the
orders
issued
by
the
heads
of
the
confederacy
and
the
betrayal
of
their
designs
was
decreed
to
be
death
all
machines
were
doomed
by
them
to
destruction
whether
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
cloth
calico
or
lace
and
a
reign
of
terror
began
which
lasted
for
years
in
yorkshire
and
lancashire
mills
were
boldly
attacked
by
armed
rioters
and
in
many
cases
they
were
wrecked
or
burnt
so
that
it
became
necessary
to
guard
them
by
soldiers
and
yeomanry
the
masters
themselves
were
doomed
to
death
many
of
them
were
assaulted
and
some
were
murdered
at
length
the
law
was
vigorously
set
in
motion
numbers
of
the
misguided
luddites
were
apprehended
some
were
executed
and
after
several
years
violent
commotion
from
this
cause
the
riots
were
at
length
quelled
among
the
numerous
manufacturers
whose
works
were
attacked
by
the
luddites
was
the
inventor
of
the
machine
himself
one
bright
sunny
day
in
the
summer
of
a
body
of
rioters
entered
his
factory
at
loughborough
with
torches
and
set
fire
to
it
destroying
and
above
worth
of
property
ten
of
the
men
were
apprehended
for
the
felony
and
eight
of
them
were
executed
heathcoat
made
a
claim
upon
the
county
for
compensation
and
it
was
resisted
but
the
court
of
queen
s
bench
decided
in
his
favour
and
decreed
that
the
county
must
make
good
his
loss
of
the
magistrates
sought
to
couple
with
the
payment
of
the
damage
the
condition
that
heathcoat
should
expend
the
money
in
the
county
of
leicester
but
to
this
he
would
not
assent
having
already
resolved
on
removing
his
manufacture
elsewhere
at
tiverton
in
devonshire
he
found
a
large
building
which
had
been
formerly
used
as
a
woollen
manufactory
but
the
tiverton
cloth
trade
having
fallen
into
decay
the
building
remained
unoccupied
and
the
town
itself
was
generally
in
a
very
condition
heathcoat
bought
the
old
mill
renovated
and
enlarged
it
and
there
recommenced
the
manufacture
of
lace
upon
a
larger
scale
than
before
keeping
in
full
work
as
many
as
three
hundred
machines
and
employing
a
large
number
of
artisans
at
good
wages
not
only
did
he
carry
on
the
manufacture
of
lace
but
the
various
branches
of
business
connected
with
and
finishing
he
also
established
at
tiverton
an
and
works
for
the
manufacture
of
agricultural
implements
which
proved
of
great
convenience
to
the
district
it
was
a
favourite
idea
of
his
that
steam
power
was
capable
of
being
applied
to
perform
all
the
heavy
drudgery
of
life
and
he
laboured
for
a
long
time
at
the
invention
of
a
in
he
so
far
completed
his
invention
as
to
be
enabled
to
take
out
a
patent
for
it
and
heathcoat
s
though
it
has
since
been
superseded
by
fowler
s
was
considered
the
best
machine
of
the
kind
that
had
up
to
that
time
been
invented
heathcoat
was
a
man
of
great
natural
gifts
he
possessed
a
sound
understanding
quick
perception
and
a
genius
for
business
of
the
highest
order
with
these
he
combined
uprightness
honesty
and
which
are
the
true
glory
of
human
character
himself
a
diligent
he
gave
ready
encouragement
to
deserving
youths
in
his
employment
stimulating
their
talents
and
fostering
their
energies
during
his
own
busy
life
he
contrived
to
save
time
to
master
french
and
italian
of
which
he
acquired
an
accurate
and
grammatical
knowledge
his
mind
was
largely
stored
with
the
results
of
a
careful
study
of
the
best
literature
and
there
were
few
subjects
on
which
he
had
not
formed
for
himself
shrewd
and
accurate
views
the
two
thousand
workpeople
in
his
employment
regarded
him
almost
as
a
father
and
he
carefully
provided
for
their
comfort
and
improvement
prosperity
did
not
spoil
him
as
it
does
so
many
nor
close
his
heart
against
the
claims
of
the
poor
and
struggling
who
were
always
sure
of
his
sympathy
and
help
to
provide
for
the
education
of
the
children
of
his
workpeople
he
built
schools
for
them
at
a
cost
of
about
he
was
also
a
man
of
singularly
cheerful
and
buoyant
disposition
a
favourite
with
men
of
all
classes
and
most
admired
and
beloved
by
those
who
knew
him
best
in
the
electors
of
tiverton
of
which
town
heathcoat
had
proved
himself
so
genuine
a
benefactor
returned
him
to
represent
them
in
parliament
and
he
continued
their
member
for
nearly
thirty
years
during
a
great
part
of
that
time
he
had
lord
palmerston
for
his
colleague
and
the
noble
lord
on
more
than
one
public
occasion
expressed
the
high
regard
which
he
entertained
for
his
venerable
friend
on
retiring
from
the
representation
in
owing
to
advancing
age
and
increasing
infirmities
thirteen
hundred
of
his
workmen
presented
him
with
a
silver
inkstand
and
gold
pen
in
token
of
their
esteem
he
enjoyed
his
leisure
for
only
two
more
years
dying
in
january
at
the
age
of
and
leaving
behind
him
a
character
for
probity
virtue
manliness
and
mechanical
genius
of
which
his
descendants
may
well
be
proud
we
next
turn
to
a
career
of
a
very
different
kind
that
of
the
illustrious
but
unfortunate
jacquard
whose
life
also
illustrates
in
a
remarkable
manner
the
influence
which
ingenious
men
even
of
the
humblest
rank
may
exercise
upon
the
industry
of
a
nation
jacquard
was
the
son
of
a
couple
of
lyons
his
father
being
a
weaver
and
his
mother
a
pattern
reader
they
were
too
poor
to
give
him
any
but
the
most
meagre
education
when
he
was
of
age
to
learn
a
trade
his
father
placed
him
with
a
an
old
clerk
who
made
up
the
master
s
accounts
gave
jacquard
some
lessons
in
mathematics
he
very
shortly
began
to
display
a
remarkable
turn
for
mechanics
and
some
of
his
contrivances
quite
astonished
the
old
clerk
who
advised
jacquard
s
father
to
put
him
to
some
other
trade
in
which
his
peculiar
abilities
might
have
better
scope
than
in
bookbinding
he
was
accordingly
put
apprentice
to
a
cutler
but
was
so
badly
treated
by
his
master
that
he
shortly
afterwards
left
his
employment
on
which
he
was
placed
with
a
his
parents
dying
jacquard
found
himself
in
a
measure
compelled
to
take
to
his
father
s
two
looms
and
carry
on
the
trade
of
a
weaver
he
immediately
proceeded
to
improve
the
looms
and
became
so
engrossed
with
his
inventions
that
he
forgot
his
work
and
very
soon
found
himself
at
the
end
of
his
means
he
then
sold
the
looms
to
pay
his
debts
at
the
same
time
that
he
took
upon
himself
the
burden
of
supporting
a
wife
he
became
still
poorer
and
to
satisfy
his
creditors
he
next
sold
his
cottage
he
tried
to
find
employment
but
in
vain
people
believing
him
to
be
an
idler
occupied
with
mere
dreams
about
his
inventions
at
length
he
obtained
employment
with
a
of
bresse
whither
he
went
his
wife
remaining
at
lyons
earning
a
precarious
living
by
making
straw
bonnets
we
hear
nothing
further
of
jacquard
for
some
years
but
in
the
interval
he
seems
to
have
prosecuted
his
improvement
in
the
drawloom
for
the
better
manufacture
of
figured
fabrics
for
in
he
brought
out
his
contrivance
for
selecting
the
warp
threads
which
when
added
to
the
loom
superseded
the
services
of
a
the
adoption
of
this
machine
was
slow
but
steady
and
in
ten
years
after
its
introduction
of
them
were
found
at
work
in
lyons
jacquard
s
pursuits
were
rudely
interrupted
by
the
revolution
and
in
we
find
him
fighting
in
the
ranks
of
the
lyonnaise
volunteers
against
the
army
of
the
convention
under
the
command
of
dubois
crancé
the
city
was
taken
jacquard
fled
and
joined
the
army
of
the
rhine
where
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
he
might
have
remained
a
soldier
but
that
his
only
son
having
been
shot
dead
at
his
side
he
deserted
and
returned
to
lyons
to
recover
his
wife
he
found
her
in
a
garret
still
employed
at
her
old
trade
of
making
while
living
in
concealment
with
her
his
mind
reverted
to
the
inventions
over
which
he
had
so
long
brooded
in
former
years
but
he
had
no
means
wherewith
to
prosecute
them
jacquard
found
it
necessary
however
to
emerge
from
his
and
try
to
find
some
employment
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
it
with
an
intelligent
manufacturer
and
while
working
by
day
he
went
on
inventing
by
night
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
great
improvements
might
still
be
introduced
in
looms
for
figured
goods
and
he
incidentally
mentioned
the
subject
one
day
to
his
master
regretting
at
the
same
time
that
his
limited
means
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
his
ideas
happily
his
master
appreciated
the
value
of
the
suggestions
and
with
laudable
generosity
placed
a
sum
of
money
at
his
disposal
that
he
might
prosecute
the
proposed
improvements
at
his
leisure
in
three
months
jacquard
had
invented
a
loom
to
substitute
mechanical
action
for
the
irksome
and
toilsome
labour
of
the
workman
the
loom
was
exhibited
at
the
exposition
of
national
industry
at
paris
in
and
obtained
a
bronze
medal
jacquard
was
further
honoured
by
a
visit
at
lyons
from
the
minister
carnot
who
desired
to
congratulate
him
in
person
on
the
success
of
his
invention
in
the
following
year
the
society
of
arts
in
london
offered
a
prize
for
the
invention
of
a
machine
for
manufacturing
and
for
ships
jacquard
heard
of
this
and
while
walking
one
day
in
the
fields
according
to
his
custom
he
turned
the
subject
over
in
his
mind
and
contrived
the
plan
of
a
machine
for
the
purpose
his
friend
the
manufacturer
again
furnished
him
with
the
means
of
carrying
out
his
idea
and
in
three
weeks
jacquard
had
completed
his
invention
jacquard
s
achievement
having
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
prefect
of
the
department
he
was
summoned
before
that
functionary
and
on
his
explanation
of
the
working
of
the
machine
a
report
on
the
subject
was
forwarded
to
the
emperor
the
inventor
was
forthwith
summoned
to
paris
with
his
machine
and
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
emperor
who
received
him
with
the
consideration
due
to
his
genius
the
interview
lasted
two
hours
during
which
jacquard
placed
at
his
ease
by
the
emperor
s
affability
explained
to
him
the
improvements
which
he
proposed
to
make
in
the
looms
for
weaving
figured
goods
the
result
was
that
he
was
provided
with
apartments
in
the
conservatoire
des
arts
et
métiers
where
he
had
the
use
of
the
workshop
during
his
stay
and
was
provided
with
a
suitable
allowance
for
his
maintenance
installed
in
the
conservatoire
jacquard
proceeded
to
complete
the
details
of
his
improved
loom
he
had
the
advantage
of
minutely
inspecting
the
various
exquisite
pieces
of
mechanism
contained
in
that
great
treasury
of
human
ingenuity
among
the
machines
which
more
particularly
attracted
his
attention
and
eventually
set
him
upon
the
track
of
his
discovery
was
a
loom
for
weaving
flowered
silk
made
by
vaucanson
the
celebrated
vaucanson
was
a
man
of
the
highest
order
of
constructive
genius
the
inventive
faculty
was
so
strong
in
him
that
it
may
almost
be
said
to
have
amounted
to
a
passion
and
could
not
be
restrained
the
saying
that
the
poet
is
born
not
made
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
inventor
who
though
indebted
like
the
other
to
culture
and
improved
opportunities
nevertheless
contrives
and
constructs
new
combinations
of
machinery
mainly
to
gratify
his
own
instinct
this
was
peculiarly
the
case
with
vaucanson
for
his
most
elaborate
works
were
not
so
much
distinguished
for
their
utility
as
for
the
curious
ingenuity
which
they
displayed
while
a
mere
boy
attending
sunday
conversations
with
his
mother
he
amused
himself
by
watching
through
the
chinks
of
a
partition
wall
part
of
the
movements
of
a
clock
in
the
adjoining
apartment
he
endeavoured
to
understand
them
and
by
brooding
over
the
subject
after
several
months
he
discovered
the
principle
of
the
escapement
from
that
time
the
subject
of
mechanical
invention
took
complete
possession
of
him
with
some
rude
tools
which
he
contrived
he
made
a
wooden
clock
that
marked
the
hours
with
remarkable
exactness
while
he
made
for
a
miniature
chapel
the
figures
of
some
angels
which
waved
their
wings
and
some
priests
that
made
several
ecclesiastical
movements
with
the
view
of
executing
some
other
automata
he
had
designed
he
proceeded
to
study
anatomy
music
and
mechanics
which
occupied
him
for
several
years
the
sight
of
the
in
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
inspired
him
with
the
resolution
to
invent
a
similar
figure
that
should
and
after
several
years
study
and
labour
though
struggling
with
illness
he
succeeded
in
accomplishing
his
object
he
next
produced
a
which
was
succeeded
by
a
most
ingenious
of
his
contrivances
swam
dabbled
drank
and
quacked
like
a
real
duck
he
next
invented
an
asp
employed
in
the
tragedy
of
cléopâtre
which
hissed
and
darted
at
the
bosom
of
the
actress
vaucanson
however
did
not
confine
himself
merely
to
the
making
of
automata
by
reason
of
his
ingenuity
cardinal
de
fleury
appointed
him
inspector
of
the
silk
manufactories
of
france
and
he
was
no
sooner
in
office
than
with
his
usual
irrepressible
instinct
to
invent
he
proceeded
to
introduce
improvements
in
silk
machinery
one
of
these
was
his
mill
for
thrown
silk
which
so
excited
the
anger
of
the
lyons
operatives
who
feared
the
loss
of
employment
through
its
means
that
they
pelted
him
with
stones
and
had
nearly
killed
him
he
nevertheless
went
on
inventing
and
next
produced
a
machine
for
weaving
flowered
silks
with
a
contrivance
for
giving
a
dressing
to
the
thread
so
as
to
render
that
of
each
bobbin
or
skein
of
an
equal
thickness
when
vaucanson
died
in
after
a
long
illness
he
bequeathed
his
collection
of
machines
to
the
queen
who
seems
to
have
set
but
small
value
on
them
and
they
were
shortly
after
dispersed
but
his
machine
for
weaving
flowered
silks
was
happily
preserved
in
the
conservatoire
des
arts
et
métiers
and
there
jacquard
found
it
among
the
many
curious
and
interesting
articles
in
the
collection
it
proved
of
the
utmost
value
to
him
for
it
immediately
set
him
on
the
track
of
the
principal
modification
which
he
introduced
in
his
improved
loom
one
of
the
chief
features
of
vaucanson
s
machine
was
a
pierced
cylinder
which
according
to
the
holes
it
presented
when
revolved
regulated
the
movement
of
certain
needles
and
caused
the
threads
of
the
warp
to
deviate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
a
given
design
though
only
of
a
simple
character
jacquard
seized
upon
the
suggestion
with
avidity
and
with
the
genius
of
the
true
inventor
at
once
proceeded
to
improve
upon
it
at
the
end
of
a
month
his
was
completed
to
the
cylinder
of
vancanson
he
added
an
endless
piece
of
pasteboard
pierced
with
a
number
of
holes
through
which
the
threads
of
the
warp
were
presented
to
the
weaver
while
another
piece
of
mechanism
indicated
to
the
workman
the
colour
of
the
shuttle
which
he
ought
to
throw
thus
the
drawboy
and
the
reader
of
designs
were
both
at
once
superseded
the
first
use
jacquard
made
of
his
new
loom
was
to
weave
with
it
several
yards
of
rich
stuff
which
he
presented
to
the
empress
josephine
napoleon
was
highly
gratified
with
the
result
of
the
inventor
s
labours
and
ordered
a
number
of
the
looms
to
be
constructed
by
the
best
workmen
after
jacquard
s
model
and
presented
to
him
after
which
he
returned
to
lyons
there
he
experienced
the
frequent
fate
of
inventors
he
was
regarded
by
his
townsmen
as
an
enemy
and
treated
by
them
as
kay
hargreaves
and
arkwright
had
been
in
lancashire
the
workmen
looked
upon
the
new
loom
as
fatal
to
their
trade
and
feared
lest
it
should
at
once
take
the
bread
from
their
mouths
a
tumultuous
meeting
was
held
on
the
place
des
terreaux
when
it
was
determined
to
destroy
the
machines
this
was
however
prevented
by
the
military
but
jacquard
was
denounced
and
hanged
in
effigy
the
conseil
des
prud
hommes
in
vain
endeavoured
to
allay
the
excitement
and
they
were
themselves
denounced
at
length
carried
away
by
the
popular
impulse
the
prud
hommes
most
of
whom
had
been
workmen
and
sympathized
with
the
class
had
one
of
jacquard
s
looms
carried
off
and
publicly
broken
in
pieces
riots
followed
in
one
of
which
jacquard
was
dragged
along
the
quay
by
an
infuriated
mob
intending
to
drown
him
but
he
was
rescued
the
great
value
of
the
jacquard
loom
however
could
not
be
denied
and
its
success
was
only
a
question
of
time
jacquard
was
urged
by
some
english
silk
manufacturers
to
pass
over
into
england
and
settle
there
but
notwithstanding
the
harsh
and
cruel
treatment
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
his
townspeople
his
patriotism
was
too
strong
to
permit
him
to
accept
their
offer
the
english
manufacturers
however
adopted
his
loom
then
it
was
and
only
then
that
lyons
threatened
to
be
beaten
out
of
the
field
adopted
it
with
eagerness
and
before
long
the
jacquard
machine
was
employed
in
nearly
all
kinds
of
weaving
the
result
proved
that
the
fears
of
the
workpeople
had
been
entirely
unfounded
instead
of
diminishing
employment
the
jacquard
loom
increased
it
at
least
tenfold
the
number
of
persons
occupied
in
the
manufacture
of
figured
goods
in
lyons
was
stated
by
leon
faucher
to
have
been
in
and
that
number
has
since
been
considerably
increased
as
for
jacquard
himself
the
rest
of
his
life
passed
peacefully
excepting
that
the
workpeople
who
dragged
him
along
the
quay
to
drown
him
were
shortly
after
found
eager
to
bear
him
in
triumph
along
the
same
route
in
celebration
of
his
birthday
but
his
modesty
would
not
permit
him
to
take
part
in
such
a
demonstration
the
municipal
council
of
lyons
proposed
to
him
that
he
should
devote
himself
to
improving
his
machine
for
the
benefit
of
the
local
industry
to
which
jacquard
agreed
in
consideration
of
a
moderate
pension
the
amount
of
which
was
fixed
by
himself
after
perfecting
his
invention
accordingly
he
retired
at
sixty
to
end
his
days
at
oullins
his
father
s
native
place
it
was
there
that
he
received
in
the
decoration
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
it
was
there
that
he
died
and
was
buried
in
a
statue
was
erected
to
his
memory
but
his
relatives
remained
in
poverty
and
twenty
years
after
his
death
his
two
nieces
were
under
the
necessity
of
selling
for
a
few
hundred
francs
the
gold
medal
bestowed
upon
their
uncle
by
louis
xviii
such
says
a
french
writer
was
the
gratitude
of
the
manufacturing
interests
of
lyons
to
the
man
to
whom
it
owes
so
large
a
portion
of
its
it
would
be
easy
to
extend
the
martyrology
of
inventors
and
to
cite
the
names
of
other
equally
distinguished
men
who
have
without
any
corresponding
advantage
to
themselves
contributed
to
the
industrial
progress
of
the
age
it
has
too
often
happened
that
genius
has
planted
the
tree
of
which
patient
dulness
has
gathered
the
fruit
but
we
will
confine
ourselves
for
the
present
to
a
brief
account
of
an
inventor
of
comparatively
recent
date
by
way
of
illustration
of
the
difficulties
and
privations
which
it
is
so
frequently
the
lot
of
mechanical
genius
to
surmount
we
allude
to
joshua
heilmann
the
inventor
of
the
combing
machine
heilmann
was
born
in
at
mulhouse
the
principal
seat
of
the
alsace
cotton
manufacture
his
father
was
engaged
in
that
business
and
joshua
entered
his
office
at
fifteen
he
remained
there
for
two
years
employing
his
spare
time
in
mechanical
drawing
he
afterwards
spent
two
years
in
his
uncle
s
in
paris
prosecuting
the
study
of
mathematics
in
the
evenings
some
of
his
relatives
having
established
a
small
factory
at
mulhouse
young
heilmann
was
placed
with
tissot
and
rey
at
paris
to
learn
the
practice
of
that
firm
at
the
same
time
he
became
a
student
at
the
conservatoire
des
arts
et
métiers
where
he
attended
the
lectures
and
studied
the
machines
in
the
museum
he
also
took
practical
lessons
in
turning
from
a
toymaker
after
some
time
thus
diligently
occupied
he
returned
to
alsace
to
superintend
the
construction
of
the
machinery
for
the
new
factory
at
which
was
shortly
finished
and
set
to
work
the
operations
of
the
manufactory
were
however
seriously
affected
by
a
commercial
crisis
which
occurred
and
it
passed
into
other
hands
on
which
heilmann
returned
to
his
family
at
mulhouse
he
had
in
the
mean
time
been
occupying
much
of
his
leisure
with
inventions
more
particularly
in
connection
with
the
weaving
of
cotton
and
the
preparation
of
the
staple
for
spinning
one
of
his
earliest
contrivances
was
an
in
which
twenty
needles
were
employed
working
simultaneously
and
he
succeeded
in
accomplishing
his
object
after
about
six
months
labour
for
this
invention
which
he
exhibited
at
the
exposition
of
he
received
a
gold
medal
and
was
decorated
with
the
legion
of
honour
other
inventions
quickly
improved
loom
a
machine
for
measuring
and
folding
fabrics
an
improvement
of
the
bobbin
and
fly
frames
of
the
english
spinners
and
a
weft
with
various
improvements
in
the
machinery
for
preparing
spinning
and
weaving
silk
and
cotton
one
of
his
most
ingenious
contrivances
was
his
loom
for
weaving
simultaneously
two
pieces
of
velvet
or
other
piled
fabric
united
by
the
pile
common
to
both
with
a
knife
and
traversing
apparatus
for
separating
the
two
fabrics
when
woven
but
by
far
the
most
beautiful
and
ingenious
of
his
inventions
was
the
the
history
of
which
we
now
proceed
shortly
to
describe
heilmann
had
for
some
years
been
diligently
studying
the
contrivance
of
a
machine
for
combing
cotton
the
ordinary
being
found
ineffective
in
preparing
the
raw
material
for
spinning
especially
the
finer
sorts
of
yarn
besides
causing
considerable
waste
to
avoid
these
imperfections
the
of
alsace
offered
a
prize
of
francs
for
an
improved
and
heilmann
immediately
proceeded
to
compete
for
the
reward
he
was
not
stimulated
by
the
desire
of
gain
for
he
was
comparatively
rich
having
acquired
a
considerable
fortune
by
his
wife
it
was
a
saying
of
his
that
one
will
never
accomplish
great
things
who
is
constantly
asking
himself
how
much
gain
will
this
bring
me
what
mainly
impelled
him
was
the
irrepressible
instinct
of
the
inventor
who
no
sooner
has
a
mechanical
problem
set
before
him
than
he
feels
impelled
to
undertake
its
solution
the
problem
in
this
case
was
however
much
more
difficult
than
he
had
anticipated
the
close
study
of
the
subject
occupied
him
for
several
years
and
the
expenses
in
which
he
became
involved
in
connection
with
it
were
so
great
that
his
wife
s
fortune
was
shortly
swallowed
up
and
he
was
reduced
to
poverty
without
being
able
to
bring
his
machine
to
perfection
from
that
time
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
relying
mainly
on
the
help
of
his
friends
to
enable
him
to
prosecute
the
invention
while
still
struggling
with
poverty
and
difficulties
heilmann
s
wife
died
believing
her
husband
ruined
and
shortly
after
he
proceeded
to
england
and
settled
for
a
time
at
manchester
still
labouring
at
his
machine
he
had
a
model
made
for
him
by
the
eminent
sharpe
roberts
and
company
but
still
he
could
not
make
it
work
satisfactorily
and
he
was
at
length
brought
almost
to
the
verge
of
despair
he
returned
to
france
to
visit
his
family
still
pursuing
his
idea
which
had
obtained
complete
possession
of
his
mind
while
sitting
by
his
hearth
one
evening
meditating
upon
the
hard
fate
of
inventors
and
the
misfortunes
in
which
their
families
so
often
become
involved
he
found
himself
almost
unconsciously
watching
his
daughters
coming
their
long
hair
and
drawing
it
out
at
full
length
between
their
fingers
the
thought
suddenly
struck
him
that
if
he
could
successfully
imitate
in
a
machine
the
process
of
combing
out
the
longest
hair
and
forcing
back
the
short
by
reversing
the
action
of
the
comb
it
might
serve
to
extricate
him
from
his
difficulty
it
may
be
remembered
that
this
incident
in
the
life
of
heilmann
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
beautiful
picture
by
elmore
which
was
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
exhibition
of
upon
this
idea
he
proceeded
introduced
the
apparently
simple
but
really
most
intricate
process
of
and
after
great
labour
he
succeeded
in
perfecting
the
invention
the
singular
beauty
of
the
process
can
only
be
appreciated
by
those
who
have
witnessed
the
machine
at
work
when
the
similarity
of
its
movements
to
that
of
combing
the
hair
which
suggested
the
invention
is
at
once
apparent
the
machine
has
been
described
as
acting
with
almost
the
delicacy
of
touch
of
the
human
it
combs
the
lock
of
cotton
both
places
the
fibres
exactly
parallel
with
each
other
separates
the
long
from
the
short
and
unites
the
long
fibres
in
one
sliver
and
the
short
ones
in
another
in
fine
the
machine
not
only
acts
with
the
delicate
accuracy
of
the
human
fingers
but
apparently
with
the
delicate
intelligence
of
the
human
mind
the
chief
commercial
value
of
the
invention
consisted
in
its
rendering
the
commoner
sorts
of
cotton
available
for
fine
spinning
the
manufacturers
were
thereby
enabled
to
select
the
most
suitable
fibres
for
fabrics
and
to
produce
the
finer
sorts
of
yarn
in
much
larger
quantities
it
became
possible
by
its
means
to
make
thread
so
fine
that
a
length
of
miles
might
be
spun
from
a
single
pound
weight
of
the
prepared
cotton
and
worked
up
into
the
finer
sorts
of
lace
the
original
shilling
s
worth
of
before
it
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
consumer
might
thus
be
increased
to
the
value
of
between
and
sterling
the
beauty
and
utility
of
heilmann
s
invention
were
at
once
appreciated
by
the
english
six
lancashire
firms
united
and
purchased
the
patent
for
for
england
for
the
sum
of
the
paid
the
same
sum
for
the
privilege
of
applying
the
process
to
wool
and
the
marshall
of
leeds
for
the
privilege
of
applying
it
to
flax
thus
wealth
suddenly
flowed
in
upon
poor
heilmann
at
last
but
he
did
not
live
to
enjoy
it
scarcely
had
his
long
labours
been
crowned
by
success
than
he
died
and
his
son
who
had
shared
in
his
privations
shortly
followed
him
it
is
at
the
price
of
lives
such
as
these
that
the
wonders
of
civilisation
are
achieved

to
most
of
the
ancient
nations
that
of
manufacturing
enamelled
earthenware
was
much
less
common
it
was
however
practised
by
the
ancient
etruscans
specimens
of
whose
ware
are
still
to
be
found
in
antiquarian
collections
but
it
became
a
lost
art
and
was
only
recovered
at
a
comparatively
recent
date
the
etruscan
ware
was
very
valuable
in
ancient
times
a
vase
being
worth
its
weight
in
gold
in
the
time
of
augustus
the
moors
seem
to
have
preserved
amongst
them
a
knowledge
of
the
art
which
they
were
found
practising
in
the
island
of
majorca
when
it
was
taken
by
the
pisans
in
among
the
spoil
carried
away
were
many
plates
of
moorish
earthenware
which
in
token
of
triumph
were
embedded
in
the
walls
of
several
of
the
ancient
churches
of
pisa
where
they
are
to
be
seen
to
this
day
about
two
centuries
later
the
italians
began
to
make
an
imitation
enamelled
ware
which
they
named
majolica
after
the
moorish
place
of
manufacture
the
reviver
or
of
the
art
of
enamelling
in
italy
was
luca
della
robbia
a
florentine
sculptor
vasari
describes
him
as
a
man
of
indefatigable
perseverance
working
with
his
chisel
all
day
and
practising
drawing
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
he
pursued
the
latter
art
with
so
much
assiduity
that
when
working
late
to
prevent
his
feet
from
freezing
with
the
cold
he
was
accustomed
to
provide
himself
with
a
basket
of
shavings
in
which
he
placed
them
to
keep
himself
warm
and
enable
him
to
proceed
with
his
drawings
nor
says
vasari
am
i
in
the
least
astonished
at
this
since
no
man
ever
becomes
distinguished
in
any
art
whatsoever
who
does
not
early
begin
to
acquire
the
power
of
supporting
heat
cold
hunger
thirst
and
other
discomforts
whereas
those
persons
deceive
themselves
altogether
who
suppose
that
when
taking
their
ease
and
surrounded
by
all
the
enjoyments
of
the
world
they
may
still
attain
to
honourable
distinction
it
is
not
by
sleeping
but
by
waking
watching
and
labouring
continually
that
proficiency
is
attained
and
reputation
but
luca
notwithstanding
all
his
application
and
industry
did
not
succeed
in
earning
enough
money
by
sculpture
to
enable
him
to
live
by
the
art
and
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
nevertheless
be
able
to
pursue
his
modelling
in
some
material
more
facile
and
less
dear
than
marble
hence
it
was
that
he
began
to
make
his
models
in
clay
and
to
endeavour
by
experiment
so
to
coat
and
bake
the
clay
as
to
render
those
models
durable
after
many
trials
he
at
length
discovered
a
method
of
covering
the
clay
with
a
material
which
when
exposed
to
the
intense
heat
of
a
furnace
became
converted
into
an
almost
imperishable
enamel
he
afterwards
made
the
further
discovery
of
a
method
of
imparting
colour
to
the
enamel
thus
greatly
adding
to
its
beauty
the
fame
of
luca
s
work
extended
throughout
europe
and
specimens
of
his
art
became
widely
diffused
many
of
them
were
sent
into
france
and
spain
where
they
were
greatly
prized
at
that
time
coarse
brown
jars
and
pipkins
were
almost
the
only
articles
of
earthenware
produced
in
france
and
this
continued
to
be
the
case
with
comparatively
small
improvement
until
the
time
of
man
who
toiled
and
fought
against
stupendous
difficulties
with
a
heroism
that
sheds
a
glow
almost
of
romance
over
the
events
of
his
chequered
life
bernard
palissy
is
supposed
to
have
been
born
in
the
south
of
france
in
the
diocese
of
agen
about
the
year
his
father
was
probably
a
worker
in
glass
to
which
trade
bernard
was
brought
up
his
parents
were
poor
poor
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
any
school
education
i
had
no
other
books
said
he
afterwards
than
heaven
and
earth
which
are
open
to
he
learnt
however
the
art
of
to
which
he
added
that
of
drawing
and
afterwards
reading
and
writing
when
about
eighteen
years
old
the
glass
trade
becoming
decayed
palissy
left
his
father
s
house
with
his
wallet
on
his
back
and
went
out
into
the
world
to
search
whether
there
was
any
place
in
it
for
him
he
first
travelled
towards
gascony
working
at
his
trade
where
he
could
find
employment
and
occasionally
occupying
part
of
his
time
in
then
he
travelled
northwards
sojourning
for
various
periods
at
different
places
in
france
flanders
and
lower
germany
thus
palissy
occupied
about
ten
more
years
of
his
life
after
which
he
married
and
ceased
from
his
wanderings
settling
down
to
practise
and
at
the
small
town
of
saintes
in
the
lower
charente
there
children
were
born
to
him
and
not
only
his
responsibilities
but
his
expenses
increased
while
do
what
he
could
his
earnings
remained
too
small
for
his
needs
it
was
therefore
necessary
for
him
to
bestir
himself
probably
he
felt
capable
of
better
things
than
drudging
in
an
employment
so
precarious
as
and
hence
he
was
induced
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
kindred
art
of
painting
and
enamelling
earthenware
yet
on
this
subject
he
was
wholly
ignorant
for
he
had
never
seen
earth
baked
before
he
began
his
operations
he
had
therefore
everything
to
learn
by
himself
without
any
helper
but
he
was
full
of
hope
eager
to
learn
of
unbounded
perseverance
and
inexhaustible
patience
it
was
the
sight
of
an
elegant
cup
of
italian
probably
one
of
luca
della
robbia
s
first
set
palissy
about
the
new
art
a
circumstance
so
apparently
insignificant
would
have
produced
no
effect
upon
an
ordinary
mind
or
even
upon
palissy
himself
at
an
ordinary
time
but
occurring
as
it
did
when
he
was
meditating
a
change
of
calling
he
at
once
became
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
imitating
it
the
sight
of
this
cup
disturbed
his
whole
existence
and
the
determination
to
discover
the
enamel
with
which
it
was
glazed
thenceforward
possessed
him
like
a
passion
had
he
been
a
single
man
he
might
have
travelled
into
italy
in
search
of
the
secret
but
he
was
bound
to
his
wife
and
his
children
and
could
not
leave
them
so
he
remained
by
their
side
groping
in
the
dark
in
the
hope
of
finding
out
the
process
of
making
and
enamelling
earthenware
at
first
he
could
merely
guess
the
materials
of
which
the
enamel
was
composed
and
he
proceeded
to
try
all
manner
of
experiments
to
ascertain
what
they
really
were
he
pounded
all
the
substances
which
he
supposed
were
likely
to
produce
it
then
he
bought
common
earthen
pots
broke
them
into
pieces
and
spreading
his
compounds
over
them
subjected
them
to
the
heat
of
a
furnace
which
he
erected
for
the
purpose
of
baking
them
his
experiments
failed
and
the
results
were
broken
pots
and
a
waste
of
fuel
drugs
time
and
labour
women
do
not
readily
sympathise
with
experiments
whose
only
tangible
effect
is
to
dissipate
the
means
of
buying
clothes
and
food
for
their
children
and
palissy
s
wife
however
dutiful
in
other
respects
could
not
be
reconciled
to
the
purchase
of
more
earthen
pots
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
bought
only
to
be
broken
yet
she
must
needs
submit
for
palissy
had
become
thoroughly
possessed
by
the
determination
to
master
the
secret
of
the
enamel
and
would
not
leave
it
alone
for
many
successive
months
and
years
palissy
pursued
his
experiments
the
first
furnace
having
proved
a
failure
he
proceeded
to
erect
another
out
of
doors
there
he
burnt
more
wood
spoiled
more
drugs
and
pots
and
lost
more
time
until
poverty
stared
him
and
his
family
in
the
face
thus
said
he
i
fooled
away
several
years
with
sorrow
and
sighs
because
i
could
not
at
all
arrive
at
my
in
the
intervals
of
his
experiments
he
occasionally
worked
at
his
former
callings
painting
on
glass
drawing
portraits
and
measuring
land
but
his
earnings
from
these
sources
were
very
small
at
length
he
was
no
longer
able
to
carry
on
his
experiments
in
his
own
furnace
because
of
the
heavy
cost
of
fuel
but
he
bought
more
potsherds
broke
them
up
as
before
into
three
or
four
hundred
pieces
and
covering
them
with
chemicals
carried
them
to
a
a
league
and
a
half
distant
from
saintes
there
to
be
baked
in
an
ordinary
furnace
after
the
operation
he
went
to
see
the
pieces
taken
out
and
to
his
dismay
the
whole
of
the
experiments
were
failures
but
though
disappointed
he
was
not
yet
defeated
for
he
determined
on
the
very
spot
to
begin
his
business
as
a
called
him
away
for
a
brief
season
from
the
pursuit
of
his
experiments
in
conformity
with
an
edict
of
the
state
it
became
necessary
to
survey
the
in
the
neighbourhood
of
saintes
for
the
purpose
of
levying
the
palissy
was
employed
to
make
this
survey
and
prepare
the
requisite
map
the
work
occupied
him
some
time
and
he
was
doubtless
well
paid
for
it
but
no
sooner
was
it
completed
than
he
proceeded
with
redoubled
zeal
to
follow
up
his
old
investigations
in
the
track
of
the
he
began
by
breaking
three
dozen
new
earthen
pots
the
pieces
of
which
he
covered
with
different
materials
which
he
had
compounded
and
then
took
them
to
a
neighbouring
to
be
baked
the
results
gave
him
a
glimmer
of
hope
the
greater
heat
of
the
had
melted
some
of
the
compounds
but
though
palissy
searched
diligently
for
the
white
enamel
he
could
find
none
for
two
more
years
he
went
on
experimenting
without
any
satisfactory
result
until
the
proceeds
of
his
survey
of
the
having
become
nearly
spent
he
was
reduced
to
poverty
again
but
he
resolved
to
make
a
last
great
effort
and
he
began
by
breaking
more
pots
than
ever
more
than
three
hundred
pieces
of
pottery
covered
with
his
compounds
were
sent
to
the
and
thither
he
himself
went
to
watch
the
results
of
the
baking
four
hours
passed
during
which
he
watched
and
then
the
furnace
was
opened
the
material
on
only
of
the
three
hundred
pieces
of
potsherd
had
melted
and
it
was
taken
out
to
cool
as
it
hardened
it
grew
and
polished
the
piece
of
potsherd
was
covered
with
white
enamel
described
by
palissy
as
singularly
beautiful
and
beautiful
it
must
no
doubt
have
been
in
his
eyes
after
all
his
weary
waiting
he
ran
home
with
it
to
his
wife
feeling
himself
as
he
expressed
it
quite
a
new
creature
but
the
prize
was
not
yet
from
it
the
partial
success
of
this
intended
last
effort
merely
had
the
effect
of
luring
him
on
to
a
succession
of
further
experiments
and
failures
in
order
that
he
might
complete
the
invention
which
he
now
believed
to
be
at
hand
he
resolved
to
build
for
himself
a
near
his
dwelling
where
he
might
carry
on
his
operations
in
secret
he
proceeded
to
build
the
furnace
with
his
own
hands
carrying
the
bricks
from
the
upon
his
back
he
was
bricklayer
labourer
and
all
from
seven
to
eight
more
months
passed
at
last
the
furnace
was
built
and
ready
for
use
palissy
had
in
the
mean
time
fashioned
a
number
of
vessels
of
clay
in
readiness
for
the
laying
on
of
the
enamel
after
being
subjected
to
a
preliminary
process
of
baking
they
were
covered
with
the
enamel
compound
and
again
placed
in
the
furnace
for
the
grand
crucial
experiment
although
his
means
were
nearly
exhausted
palissy
had
been
for
some
time
accumulating
a
great
store
of
fuel
for
the
final
effort
and
he
thought
it
was
enough
at
last
the
fire
was
lit
and
the
operation
proceeded
all
day
he
sat
by
the
furnace
feeding
it
with
fuel
he
sat
there
watching
and
feeding
all
through
the
long
night
but
the
enamel
did
not
melt
the
sun
rose
upon
his
labours
his
wife
brought
him
a
portion
of
the
scanty
morning
meal
he
would
not
stir
from
the
furnace
into
which
he
continued
from
time
to
time
to
heave
more
fuel
the
second
day
passed
and
still
the
enamel
did
not
melt
the
sun
set
and
another
night
passed
the
pale
haggard
unshorn
baffled
yet
not
beaten
palissy
sat
by
his
furnace
eagerly
looking
for
the
melting
of
the
enamel
a
third
day
and
night
fourth
a
fifth
and
even
a
sixth
for
six
long
days
and
nights
did
the
unconquerable
palissy
watch
and
toil
fighting
against
hope
and
still
the
enamel
would
not
melt
it
then
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
some
defect
in
the
materials
for
the
something
wanting
in
the
flux
so
he
set
to
work
to
pound
and
compound
fresh
materials
for
a
new
experiment
thus
two
or
three
more
weeks
passed
but
how
to
buy
more
pots
those
which
he
had
made
with
his
own
hands
for
the
purposes
of
the
first
experiment
were
by
long
baking
irretrievably
spoilt
for
the
purposes
of
a
second
his
money
was
now
all
spent
but
he
could
borrow
his
character
was
still
good
though
his
wife
and
the
neighbours
thought
him
foolishly
wasting
his
means
in
futile
experiments
nevertheless
he
succeeded
he
borrowed
sufficient
from
a
friend
to
enable
him
to
buy
more
fuel
and
more
pots
and
he
was
again
ready
for
a
further
experiment
the
pots
were
covered
with
the
new
compound
placed
in
the
furnace
and
the
fire
was
again
lit
it
was
the
last
and
most
desperate
experiment
of
the
whole
the
fire
blazed
up
the
heat
became
intense
but
still
the
enamel
did
not
melt
the
fuel
began
to
run
short
how
to
keep
up
the
fire
there
were
the
garden
palings
these
would
burn
they
must
be
sacrificed
rather
than
that
the
great
experiment
should
fail
the
garden
palings
were
pulled
up
and
cast
into
the
furnace
they
were
burnt
in
vain
the
enamel
had
not
yet
melted
ten
minutes
more
heat
might
do
it
fuel
must
be
had
at
whatever
cost
there
remained
the
household
furniture
and
shelving
a
crashing
noise
was
heard
in
the
house
and
amidst
the
screams
of
his
wife
and
children
who
now
feared
palissy
s
reason
was
giving
way
the
tables
were
seized
broken
up
and
heaved
into
the
furnace
the
enamel
had
not
melted
yet
there
remained
the
shelving
another
noise
of
the
wrenching
of
timber
was
heard
within
the
house
and
the
shelves
were
torn
down
and
hurled
after
the
furniture
into
the
fire
wife
and
children
then
rushed
from
the
house
and
went
frantically
through
the
town
calling
out
that
poor
palissy
had
gone
mad
and
was
breaking
up
his
very
furniture
for
firewood
for
an
entire
month
his
shirt
had
not
been
off
his
back
and
he
was
utterly
worn
with
toil
anxiety
watching
and
want
of
food
he
was
in
debt
and
seemed
on
the
verge
of
ruin
but
he
had
at
length
mastered
the
secret
for
the
last
great
burst
of
heat
had
melted
the
enamel
the
common
brown
household
jars
when
taken
out
of
the
furnace
after
it
had
become
cool
were
found
covered
with
a
white
glaze
for
this
he
could
endure
reproach
contumely
and
scorn
and
wait
patiently
for
the
opportunity
of
putting
his
discovery
into
practice
as
better
days
came
round
palissy
next
hired
a
potter
to
make
some
earthen
vessels
after
designs
which
he
furnished
while
he
himself
proceeded
to
model
some
medallions
in
clay
for
the
purpose
of
enamelling
them
but
how
to
maintain
himself
and
his
family
until
the
wares
were
made
and
ready
for
sale
fortunately
there
remained
one
man
in
saintes
who
still
believed
in
the
integrity
if
not
in
the
judgment
of
who
agreed
to
feed
and
lodge
him
for
six
months
while
he
went
on
with
his
manufacture
as
for
the
working
potter
whom
he
had
hired
palissy
soon
found
that
he
could
not
pay
him
the
stipulated
wages
having
already
stripped
his
dwelling
he
could
but
strip
himself
and
he
accordingly
parted
with
some
of
his
clothes
to
the
potter
in
part
payment
of
the
wages
which
he
owed
him
palissy
next
erected
an
improved
furnace
but
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
build
part
of
the
inside
with
flints
when
it
was
heated
these
flints
cracked
and
burst
and
the
spiculæ
were
scattered
over
the
pieces
of
pottery
sticking
to
them
though
the
enamel
came
out
right
the
work
was
irretrievably
spoilt
and
thus
six
more
months
labour
was
lost
persons
were
found
willing
to
buy
the
articles
at
a
low
price
notwithstanding
the
injury
they
had
sustained
but
palissy
would
not
sell
them
considering
that
to
have
done
so
would
be
to
decry
and
abate
his
honour
and
so
he
broke
in
pieces
the
entire
batch
nevertheless
says
he
hope
continued
to
inspire
me
and
i
held
on
manfully
sometimes
when
visitors
called
i
entertained
them
with
pleasantry
while
i
was
really
sad
at
heart
worst
of
all
the
sufferings
i
had
to
endure
were
the
mockeries
and
persecutions
of
those
of
my
own
household
who
were
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
me
to
execute
work
without
the
means
of
doing
so
for
years
my
furnaces
were
without
any
covering
or
protection
and
while
attending
them
i
have
been
for
nights
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
the
rain
without
help
or
consolation
save
it
might
be
the
wailing
of
cats
on
the
one
side
and
the
howling
of
dogs
on
the
other
sometimes
the
tempest
would
beat
so
furiously
against
the
furnaces
that
i
was
compelled
to
leave
them
and
seek
shelter
within
doors
drenched
by
rain
and
in
no
better
plight
than
if
i
had
been
dragged
through
mire
i
have
gone
to
lie
down
at
midnight
or
at
daybreak
stumbling
into
the
house
without
a
light
and
reeling
from
one
side
to
another
as
if
i
had
been
drunken
but
really
weary
with
watching
and
filled
with
sorrow
at
the
loss
of
my
labour
after
such
long
toiling
but
alas
my
home
proved
no
refuge
for
drenched
and
besmeared
as
i
was
i
found
in
my
chamber
a
second
persecution
worse
than
the
first
which
makes
me
even
now
marvel
that
i
was
not
utterly
consumed
by
my
many
at
this
stage
of
his
affairs
palissy
became
melancholy
and
almost
hopeless
and
seems
to
have
all
but
broken
down
he
wandered
gloomily
about
the
fields
near
saintes
his
clothes
hanging
in
tatters
and
himself
worn
to
a
skeleton
in
a
curious
passage
in
his
writings
he
describes
how
that
the
calves
of
his
legs
had
disappeared
and
were
no
longer
able
with
the
help
of
garters
to
hold
up
his
stockings
which
fell
about
his
heels
when
he
walked
the
family
continued
to
reproach
him
for
his
recklessness
and
his
neighbours
cried
shame
upon
him
for
his
obstinate
folly
so
he
returned
for
a
time
to
his
former
calling
and
after
about
a
year
s
diligent
labour
during
which
he
earned
bread
for
his
household
and
somewhat
recovered
his
character
among
his
neighbours
he
again
resumed
his
darling
enterprise
but
though
he
had
already
spent
about
ten
years
in
the
search
for
the
enamel
it
cost
him
nearly
eight
more
years
of
experimental
plodding
before
he
perfected
his
invention
he
gradually
learnt
dexterity
and
certainty
of
result
by
experience
gathering
practical
knowledge
out
of
many
failures
every
mishap
was
a
fresh
lesson
to
him
teaching
him
something
new
about
the
nature
of
enamels
the
qualities
of
argillaceous
earths
the
tempering
of
clays
and
the
construction
and
management
of
furnaces
at
last
after
about
sixteen
years
labour
palissy
took
heart
and
called
himself
potter
these
sixteen
years
had
been
his
term
of
apprenticeship
to
the
art
during
which
he
had
wholly
to
teach
himself
beginning
at
the
very
beginning
he
was
now
able
to
sell
his
wares
and
thereby
maintain
his
family
in
comfort
but
he
never
rested
satisfied
with
what
he
had
accomplished
he
proceeded
from
one
step
of
improvement
to
another
always
aiming
at
the
greatest
perfection
possible
he
studied
natural
objects
for
patterns
and
with
such
success
that
the
great
buffon
spoke
of
him
as
so
great
a
naturalist
as
nature
only
can
his
ornamental
pieces
are
now
regarded
as
rare
gems
in
the
cabinets
of
virtuosi
and
sell
at
almost
fabulous
prices
the
ornaments
on
them
are
for
the
most
part
accurate
models
from
life
of
wild
animals
lizards
and
plants
found
in
the
fields
about
saintes
and
tastefully
combined
as
ornaments
into
the
texture
of
a
plate
or
vase
when
palissy
had
reached
the
height
of
his
art
he
styled
himself
ouvrier
de
terre
et
inventeur
des
rustics
we
have
not
however
come
to
an
end
of
the
sufferings
of
palissy
respecting
which
a
few
words
remain
to
be
said
being
a
protestant
at
a
time
when
religious
persecution
waxed
hot
in
the
south
of
france
and
expressing
his
views
without
fear
he
was
regarded
as
a
dangerous
heretic
his
enemies
having
informed
against
him
his
house
at
saintes
was
entered
by
the
officers
of
justice
and
his
workshop
was
thrown
open
to
the
rabble
who
entered
and
smashed
his
pottery
while
he
himself
was
hurried
off
by
night
and
cast
into
a
dungeon
at
bordeaux
to
wait
his
turn
at
the
stake
or
the
scaffold
he
was
condemned
to
be
burnt
but
a
powerful
noble
the
constable
de
montmorency
interposed
to
save
his
because
he
had
any
special
regard
for
palissy
or
his
religion
but
because
no
other
artist
could
be
found
capable
of
executing
the
enamelled
pavement
for
his
magnificent
château
then
in
course
of
erection
at
ecouen
about
four
leagues
from
paris
by
his
influence
an
edict
was
issued
appointing
palissy
inventor
of
rustic
figulines
to
the
king
and
to
the
constable
which
had
the
effect
of
immediately
removing
him
from
the
jurisdiction
of
bourdeaux
he
was
accordingly
liberated
and
returned
to
his
home
at
saintes
only
to
find
it
devastated
and
broken
up
his
workshop
was
open
to
the
sky
and
his
works
lay
in
ruins
shaking
the
dust
of
saintes
from
his
feet
he
left
the
place
never
to
return
to
it
and
removed
to
paris
to
carry
on
the
works
ordered
of
him
by
the
constable
and
the
queen
mother
being
lodged
in
the
tuileries
while
so
occupied
besides
carrying
on
the
manufacture
of
pottery
with
the
aid
of
his
two
sons
palissy
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
wrote
and
published
several
books
on
the
potter
s
art
with
a
view
to
the
instruction
of
his
countrymen
and
in
order
that
they
might
avoid
the
many
mistakes
which
he
himself
had
made
he
also
wrote
on
agriculture
on
fortification
and
natural
history
on
which
latter
subject
he
even
delivered
lectures
to
a
limited
number
of
persons
he
waged
war
against
astrology
alchemy
witchcraft
and
like
impostures
this
stirred
up
against
him
many
enemies
who
pointed
the
finger
at
him
as
a
heretic
and
he
was
again
arrested
for
his
religion
and
imprisoned
in
the
bastille
he
was
now
an
old
man
of
trembling
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
but
his
spirit
was
as
brave
as
ever
he
was
threatened
with
death
unless
he
recanted
but
he
was
as
obstinate
in
holding
to
his
religion
as
he
had
been
in
hunting
out
the
secret
of
the
enamel
the
king
henry
even
went
to
see
him
in
prison
to
induce
him
to
abjure
his
faith
my
good
man
said
the
king
you
have
now
served
my
mother
and
myself
for
years
we
have
put
up
with
your
adhering
to
your
religion
amidst
fires
and
massacres
now
i
am
so
pressed
by
the
guise
party
as
well
as
by
my
own
people
that
i
am
constrained
to
leave
you
in
the
hands
of
your
enemies
and
you
will
be
burnt
unless
you
become
sire
answered
the
unconquerable
old
man
i
am
ready
to
give
my
life
for
the
glory
of
god
you
have
said
many
times
that
you
have
pity
on
me
and
now
i
have
pity
on
you
who
have
pronounced
the
words
am
it
is
not
spoken
like
a
king
sire
it
is
what
you
and
those
who
constrain
you
the
guisards
and
all
your
people
can
never
effect
upon
me
for
i
know
how
to
palissy
did
indeed
die
shortly
after
a
martyr
though
not
at
the
stake
he
died
in
the
bastille
after
enduring
about
a
year
s
imprisonment
peacefully
terminating
a
life
distinguished
for
heroic
labour
extraordinary
endurance
inflexible
rectitude
and
the
exhibition
of
many
rare
and
noble
virtues
the
life
of
john
frederick
böttgher
the
inventor
of
hard
porcelain
presents
a
remarkable
contrast
to
that
of
palissy
though
it
also
contains
many
points
of
singular
and
almost
romantic
interest
böttgher
was
born
at
schleiz
in
the
voightland
in
and
at
twelve
years
of
age
was
placed
apprentice
with
an
apothecary
at
berlin
he
seems
to
have
been
early
fascinated
by
chemistry
and
occupied
most
of
his
leisure
in
making
experiments
these
for
the
most
part
tended
in
one
art
of
converting
common
on
metals
into
gold
at
the
end
of
several
years
böttgher
pretended
to
have
discovered
the
universal
solvent
of
the
alchemists
and
professed
that
he
had
made
gold
by
its
means
he
exhibited
its
powers
before
his
master
the
apothecary
zörn
and
by
some
trick
or
other
succeeded
in
making
him
and
several
other
witnesses
believe
that
he
had
actually
converted
copper
into
gold
the
news
spread
abroad
that
the
apothecary
s
apprentice
had
discovered
the
grand
secret
and
crowds
collected
about
the
shop
to
get
a
sight
of
the
wonderful
young
the
king
himself
expressed
a
wish
to
see
and
converse
with
him
and
when
frederick
was
presented
with
a
piece
of
the
gold
pretended
to
have
been
converted
from
copper
he
was
so
dazzled
with
the
prospect
of
securing
an
infinite
quantity
of
being
then
in
great
straits
for
he
determined
to
secure
böttgher
and
employ
him
to
make
gold
for
him
within
the
strong
fortress
of
spandau
but
the
young
apothecary
suspecting
the
king
s
intention
and
probably
fearing
detection
at
once
resolved
on
flight
and
he
succeeded
in
getting
across
the
frontier
into
saxony
a
reward
of
a
thousand
thalers
was
offered
for
böttgher
s
apprehension
but
in
vain
he
arrived
at
wittenberg
and
appealed
for
protection
to
the
elector
of
saxony
frederick
augustus
i
king
of
poland
surnamed
the
frederick
was
himself
very
much
in
want
of
money
at
the
time
and
he
was
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
obtaining
gold
in
any
quantity
by
the
aid
of
the
young
alchemist
böttgher
was
accordingly
conveyed
in
secret
to
dresden
accompanied
by
a
royal
escort
he
had
scarcely
left
wittenberg
when
a
battalion
of
prussian
grenadiers
appeared
before
the
gates
demanding
the
s
extradition
but
it
was
too
late
böttgher
had
already
arrived
in
dresden
where
he
was
lodged
in
the
golden
house
and
treated
with
every
consideration
though
strictly
watched
and
kept
under
guard
the
elector
however
must
needs
leave
him
there
for
a
time
having
to
depart
forthwith
to
poland
then
almost
in
a
state
of
anarchy
but
impatient
for
gold
he
wrote
böttgher
from
warsaw
urging
him
to
communicate
the
secret
so
that
he
himself
might
practise
the
art
of
commutation
the
young
thus
pressed
forwarded
to
frederick
a
small
phial
containing
a
reddish
fluid
which
it
was
asserted
changed
all
metals
when
in
a
molten
state
into
gold
this
important
phial
was
taken
in
charge
by
the
prince
fürst
von
fürstenburg
who
accompanied
by
a
regiment
of
guards
hurried
with
it
to
warsaw
arrived
there
it
was
determined
to
make
immediate
trial
of
the
process
the
king
and
the
prince
locked
themselves
up
in
a
secret
chamber
of
the
palace
girt
themselves
about
with
leather
aprons
and
like
true
set
to
work
melting
copper
in
a
crucible
and
afterwards
applying
to
it
the
red
fluid
of
böttgher
but
the
result
was
unsatisfactory
for
notwithstanding
all
that
they
could
do
the
copper
obstinately
remained
copper
on
referring
to
the
alchemist
s
instructions
however
the
king
found
that
to
succeed
with
the
process
it
was
necessary
that
the
fluid
should
be
used
in
great
purity
of
heart
and
as
his
majesty
was
conscious
of
having
spent
the
evening
in
very
bad
company
he
attributed
the
failure
of
the
experiment
to
that
cause
a
second
trial
was
followed
by
no
better
results
and
then
the
king
became
furious
for
he
had
confessed
and
received
absolution
before
beginning
the
second
experiment
frederick
augustus
now
resolved
on
forcing
böttgher
to
disclose
the
golden
secret
as
the
only
means
of
relief
from
his
urgent
pecuniary
difficulties
the
alchemist
hearing
of
the
royal
intention
again
determined
to
fly
he
succeeded
in
escaping
his
guard
and
after
three
days
travel
arrived
at
ens
in
austria
where
he
thought
himself
safe
the
agents
of
the
elector
were
however
at
his
heels
they
had
tracked
him
to
the
golden
stag
which
they
surrounded
and
seizing
him
in
his
bed
notwithstanding
his
resistance
and
appeals
to
the
austrian
authorities
for
help
they
carried
him
by
force
to
dresden
from
this
time
he
was
more
strictly
watched
than
ever
and
he
was
shortly
after
transferred
to
the
strong
fortress
of
köningstein
it
was
communicated
to
him
that
the
royal
exchequer
was
completely
empty
and
that
ten
regiments
of
poles
in
arrears
of
pay
were
waiting
for
his
gold
the
king
himself
visited
him
and
told
him
in
a
severe
tone
that
if
he
did
not
at
once
proceed
to
make
gold
he
would
be
hung
mir
lass
ich
dich
years
passed
and
still
böttgher
made
no
gold
but
he
was
not
hung
it
was
reserved
for
him
to
make
a
far
more
important
discovery
than
the
conversion
of
copper
into
gold
namely
the
conversion
of
clay
into
porcelain
some
rare
specimens
of
this
ware
had
been
brought
by
the
portuguese
from
china
which
were
sold
for
more
than
their
weight
in
gold
böttgher
was
first
induced
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
subject
by
walter
von
tschirnhaus
a
maker
of
optical
instruments
also
an
alchemist
tschirnhaus
was
a
man
of
education
and
distinction
and
was
held
in
much
esteem
by
prince
fürstenburg
as
well
as
by
the
elector
he
very
sensibly
said
to
böttgher
still
in
fear
of
the
if
you
can
t
make
gold
try
and
do
something
else
make
the
alchemist
acted
on
the
hint
and
began
his
experiments
working
night
and
day
he
prosecuted
his
investigations
for
a
long
time
with
great
assiduity
but
without
success
at
length
some
red
clay
brought
to
him
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
crucibles
set
him
on
the
right
track
he
found
that
this
clay
when
submitted
to
a
high
temperature
became
vitrified
and
retained
its
shape
and
that
its
texture
resembled
that
of
porcelain
excepting
in
colour
and
opacity
he
had
in
fact
accidentally
discovered
red
porcelain
and
he
proceeded
to
manufacture
it
and
sell
it
as
porcelain
böttgher
was
however
well
aware
that
the
white
colour
was
an
essential
property
of
true
porcelain
and
he
therefore
prosecuted
his
experiments
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
secret
several
years
thus
passed
but
without
success
until
again
accident
stood
his
friend
and
helped
him
to
a
knowledge
of
the
art
of
making
white
porcelain
one
day
in
the
year
he
found
his
perruque
unusually
heavy
and
asked
of
his
valet
the
reason
the
answer
was
that
it
was
owing
to
the
powder
with
which
the
wig
was
dressed
which
consisted
of
a
kind
of
earth
then
much
used
for
hair
powder
böttgher
s
quick
imagination
immediately
seized
upon
the
idea
this
white
earthy
powder
might
possibly
be
the
very
earth
of
which
he
was
in
all
events
the
opportunity
must
not
be
let
slip
of
ascertaining
what
it
really
was
he
was
rewarded
for
his
painstaking
care
and
watchfulness
for
he
found
on
experiment
that
the
principal
ingredient
of
the
consisted
of
the
want
of
which
had
so
long
formed
an
insuperable
difficulty
in
the
way
of
his
inquiries
the
discovery
in
böttgher
s
intelligent
hands
led
to
great
results
and
proved
of
far
greater
importance
than
the
discovery
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
would
have
been
in
october
he
presented
his
first
piece
of
porcelain
to
the
elector
who
was
greatly
pleased
with
it
and
it
was
resolved
that
böttgher
should
be
furnished
with
the
means
necessary
for
perfecting
his
invention
having
obtained
a
skilled
workman
from
delft
he
began
to
porcelain
with
great
success
he
now
entirely
abandoned
alchemy
for
pottery
and
inscribed
over
the
door
of
his
workshop
this
distich
machte
grosse
einem
goldmacher
einen
böttgher
however
was
still
under
strict
surveillance
for
fear
lest
he
should
communicate
his
secret
to
others
or
escape
the
elector
s
control
the
new
workshops
and
furnaces
which
were
erected
for
him
were
guarded
by
troops
night
and
day
and
six
superior
officers
were
made
responsible
for
the
personal
security
of
the
potter
böttgher
s
further
experiments
with
his
new
furnaces
proving
very
successful
and
the
porcelain
which
he
manufactured
being
found
to
fetch
large
prices
it
was
next
determined
to
establish
a
royal
manufactory
of
porcelain
the
manufacture
of
delft
ware
was
known
to
have
greatly
enriched
holland
why
should
not
the
manufacture
of
porcelain
equally
enrich
the
elector
accordingly
a
decree
went
forth
dated
the
of
january
for
the
establishment
of
a
large
manufactory
of
porcelain
at
the
albrechtsburg
in
meissen
in
this
decree
which
was
translated
into
latin
french
and
dutch
and
distributed
by
the
ambassadors
of
the
elector
at
all
the
european
courts
frederick
augustus
set
forth
that
to
promote
the
welfare
of
saxony
which
had
suffered
much
through
the
swedish
invasion
he
had
directed
his
attention
to
the
subterranean
treasures
of
the
country
and
having
employed
some
able
persons
in
the
investigation
they
had
succeeded
in
manufacturing
a
sort
of
red
vessels
art
rother
far
superior
to
the
indian
terra
sigillata
as
also
coloured
ware
and
plates
geschirr
und
which
may
be
cut
ground
and
polished
and
are
quite
equal
to
indian
vessels
and
finally
that
specimens
of
white
porcelain
von
weissem
had
already
been
obtained
and
it
was
hoped
that
this
quality
too
would
soon
be
manufactured
in
considerable
quantities
the
royal
decree
concluded
by
inviting
foreign
artists
and
handicraftmen
to
come
to
saxony
and
engage
as
assistants
in
the
new
factory
at
high
wages
and
under
the
patronage
of
the
king
this
royal
edict
probably
gives
the
best
account
of
the
actual
state
of
böttgher
s
invention
at
the
time
it
has
been
stated
in
german
publications
that
böttgher
for
the
great
services
rendered
by
him
to
the
elector
and
to
saxony
was
made
manager
of
the
royal
porcelain
works
and
further
promoted
to
the
dignity
of
baron
doubtless
he
deserved
these
honours
but
his
treatment
was
of
an
altogether
different
character
for
it
was
shabby
cruel
and
inhuman
two
royal
officials
named
matthieu
and
nehmitz
were
put
over
his
head
as
directors
of
the
factory
while
he
himself
only
held
the
position
of
foreman
of
potters
and
at
the
same
time
was
detained
the
king
s
prisoner
during
the
erection
of
the
factory
at
meissen
while
his
assistance
was
still
indispensable
he
was
conducted
by
soldiers
to
and
from
dresden
and
even
after
the
works
were
finished
he
was
locked
up
nightly
in
his
room
all
this
preyed
upon
his
mind
and
in
repeated
letters
to
the
king
he
sought
to
obtain
mitigation
of
his
fate
some
of
these
letters
are
very
touching
i
will
devote
my
whole
soul
to
the
art
of
making
porcelain
he
writes
on
one
occasion
i
will
do
more
than
any
inventor
ever
did
before
only
give
me
liberty
liberty
to
these
appeals
the
king
turned
a
deaf
ear
he
was
ready
to
spend
money
and
grant
favours
but
liberty
he
would
not
give
he
regarded
böttgher
as
his
slave
in
this
position
the
persecuted
man
kept
on
working
for
some
time
till
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two
he
grew
negligent
disgusted
with
the
world
and
with
himself
he
took
to
drinking
such
is
the
force
of
example
that
it
no
sooner
became
known
that
böttgher
had
betaken
himself
to
this
vice
than
the
greater
number
of
the
workmen
at
the
meissen
factory
became
drunkards
too
quarrels
and
fightings
without
end
were
the
consequence
so
that
the
troops
were
frequently
called
upon
to
interfere
and
keep
peace
among
the
porzellanern
as
they
were
nicknamed
after
a
while
the
whole
of
them
more
than
three
hundred
were
shut
up
in
the
albrechtsburg
and
treated
as
prisoners
of
state
böttgher
at
last
fell
seriously
ill
and
in
may
his
dissolution
was
hourly
expected
the
king
alarmed
at
losing
so
valuable
a
slave
now
gave
him
permission
to
take
carriage
exercise
under
a
guard
and
having
somewhat
recovered
he
was
allowed
occasionally
to
go
to
dresden
in
a
letter
written
by
the
king
in
april
böttgher
was
promised
his
full
liberty
but
the
offer
came
too
late
broken
in
body
and
mind
alternately
working
and
drinking
though
with
occasional
gleams
of
nobler
intention
and
suffering
under
constant
the
result
of
his
enforced
confinement
böttgher
lingered
on
for
a
few
years
more
until
death
freed
him
from
his
sufferings
on
the
march
in
the
year
of
his
age
he
was
buried
if
he
had
been
a
the
johannis
cemetery
of
meissen
such
was
the
treatment
and
such
the
unhappy
end
of
one
of
saxony
s
greatest
benefactors
the
porcelain
manufacture
immediately
opened
up
an
important
source
of
public
revenue
and
it
became
so
productive
to
the
elector
of
saxony
that
his
example
was
shortly
after
followed
by
most
european
monarchs
although
soft
porcelain
had
been
made
at
st
cloud
fourteen
years
before
böttgher
s
discovery
the
superiority
of
the
hard
porcelain
soon
became
generally
recognised
its
manufacture
was
begun
at
sèvres
in
and
it
has
since
almost
entirely
superseded
the
softer
material
this
is
now
one
of
the
most
thriving
branches
of
french
industry
of
which
the
high
quality
of
the
articles
produced
is
certainly
indisputable
the
career
of
josiah
wedgwood
the
english
potter
was
less
chequered
and
more
prosperous
than
that
of
either
palissy
or
böttgher
and
his
lot
was
cast
in
happier
times
down
to
the
middle
of
last
century
england
was
behind
most
other
nations
of
the
first
order
in
europe
in
respect
of
skilled
industry
although
there
were
many
potters
in
wedgwood
himself
belonged
to
a
numerous
clan
of
potters
of
the
same
productions
were
of
the
rudest
kind
for
the
most
part
only
plain
brown
ware
with
the
patterns
scratched
in
while
the
clay
was
wet
the
principal
supply
of
the
better
articles
of
earthenware
came
from
delft
in
holland
and
of
drinking
stone
pots
from
cologne
two
foreign
potters
the
brothers
elers
from
nuremberg
settled
for
a
time
in
staffordshire
and
introduced
an
improved
manufacture
but
they
shortly
after
removed
to
chelsea
where
they
confined
themselves
to
the
manufacture
of
ornamental
pieces
no
porcelain
capable
of
resisting
a
scratch
with
a
hard
point
had
yet
been
made
in
england
and
for
a
long
time
the
white
ware
made
in
staffordshire
was
not
white
but
of
a
dirty
cream
colour
such
in
a
few
words
was
the
condition
of
the
pottery
manufacture
when
josiah
wedgwood
was
born
at
burslem
in
by
the
time
that
he
died
years
later
it
had
become
completely
changed
by
his
energy
skill
and
genius
he
established
the
trade
upon
a
new
and
solid
foundation
and
in
the
words
of
his
epitaph
converted
a
rude
and
inconsiderable
manufacture
into
an
elegant
art
and
an
important
branch
of
national
josiah
wedgwood
was
one
of
those
indefatigable
men
who
from
time
to
time
spring
from
the
ranks
of
the
common
people
and
by
their
energetic
character
not
only
practically
educate
the
working
population
in
habits
of
industry
but
by
the
example
of
diligence
and
perseverance
which
they
set
before
them
largely
influence
the
public
activity
in
all
directions
and
contribute
in
a
great
degree
to
form
the
national
character
he
was
like
arkwright
the
youngest
of
a
family
of
thirteen
children
his
grandfather
and
granduncle
were
both
potters
as
was
also
his
father
who
died
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
leaving
him
a
patrimony
of
twenty
pounds
he
had
learned
to
read
and
write
at
the
village
school
but
on
the
death
of
his
father
he
was
taken
from
it
and
set
to
work
as
a
thrower
in
a
small
pottery
carried
on
by
his
elder
brother
there
he
began
life
his
working
life
to
use
his
own
words
at
the
lowest
round
of
the
ladder
when
only
eleven
years
old
he
was
shortly
after
seized
by
an
attack
of
virulent
smallpox
from
the
effects
of
which
he
suffered
during
the
rest
of
his
life
for
it
was
followed
by
a
disease
in
the
right
knee
which
recurred
at
frequent
intervals
and
was
only
got
rid
of
by
the
amputation
of
the
limb
many
years
later
gladstone
in
his
eloquent
éloge
on
wedgwood
recently
delivered
at
burslem
well
observed
that
the
disease
from
which
he
suffered
was
not
improbably
the
occasion
of
his
subsequent
excellence
it
prevented
him
from
growing
up
to
be
the
active
vigorous
english
workman
possessed
of
all
his
limbs
and
knowing
right
well
the
use
of
them
but
it
put
him
upon
considering
whether
as
he
could
not
be
that
he
might
not
be
something
else
and
something
greater
it
sent
his
mind
inwards
it
drove
him
to
meditate
upon
the
laws
and
secrets
of
his
art
the
result
was
that
he
arrived
at
a
perception
and
a
grasp
of
them
which
might
perhaps
have
been
envied
certainly
have
been
owned
by
an
athenian
when
he
had
completed
his
apprenticeship
with
his
brother
josiah
joined
partnership
with
another
workman
and
carried
on
a
small
business
in
making
boxes
and
sundry
articles
for
domestic
use
another
partnership
followed
when
he
proceeded
to
make
melon
table
plates
green
pickle
leaves
candlesticks
snuffboxes
and
such
like
articles
but
he
made
comparatively
little
progress
until
he
began
business
on
his
own
account
at
burslem
in
the
year
there
he
diligently
pursued
his
calling
introducing
new
articles
to
the
trade
and
gradually
extending
his
business
what
he
chiefly
aimed
at
was
to
manufacture
ware
of
a
better
quality
than
was
then
produced
in
staffordshire
as
regarded
shape
colour
glaze
and
durability
to
understand
the
subject
thoroughly
he
devoted
his
leisure
to
the
study
of
chemistry
and
he
made
numerous
experiments
on
fluxes
glazes
and
various
sorts
of
clay
being
a
close
inquirer
and
accurate
observer
he
noticed
that
a
certain
earth
containing
silica
which
was
black
before
calcination
became
white
after
exposure
to
the
heat
of
a
furnace
this
fact
observed
and
pondered
on
led
to
the
idea
of
mixing
silica
with
the
red
powder
of
the
potteries
and
to
the
discovery
that
the
mixture
becomes
white
when
calcined
he
had
but
to
cover
this
material
with
a
vitrification
of
transparent
glaze
to
obtain
one
of
the
most
important
products
of
fictile
which
under
the
name
of
english
earthenware
was
to
attain
the
greatest
commercial
value
and
become
of
the
most
extensive
utility
wedgwood
was
for
some
time
much
troubled
by
his
furnaces
though
nothing
like
to
the
same
extent
that
palissy
was
and
he
overcame
his
difficulties
in
the
same
repeated
experiments
and
unfaltering
perseverance
his
first
attempts
at
making
porcelain
for
table
use
was
a
succession
of
disastrous
failures
labours
of
months
being
often
destroyed
in
a
day
it
was
only
after
a
long
series
of
trials
in
the
course
of
which
he
lost
time
money
and
labour
that
he
arrived
at
the
proper
sort
of
glaze
to
be
used
but
he
would
not
be
denied
and
at
last
he
conquered
success
through
patience
the
improvement
of
pottery
became
his
passion
and
was
never
lost
sight
of
for
a
moment
even
when
he
had
mastered
his
difficulties
and
become
a
prosperous
white
stone
ware
and
ware
in
large
quantities
for
home
and
foreign
went
forward
perfecting
his
manufactures
until
his
example
extending
in
all
directions
the
action
of
the
entire
district
was
stimulated
and
a
great
branch
of
british
industry
was
eventually
established
on
firm
foundations
he
aimed
throughout
at
the
highest
excellence
declaring
his
determination
to
give
over
manufacturing
any
article
whatsoever
it
might
be
rather
than
to
degrade
wedgwood
was
cordially
helped
by
many
persons
of
rank
and
influence
for
working
in
the
truest
spirit
he
readily
commanded
the
help
and
encouragement
of
other
true
workers
he
made
for
queen
charlotte
the
first
royal
of
english
manufacture
of
the
kind
afterwards
called
queen
and
was
appointed
royal
potter
a
title
which
he
prized
more
than
if
he
had
been
made
a
baron
valuable
sets
of
porcelain
were
entrusted
to
him
for
imitation
in
which
he
succeeded
to
admiration
sir
william
hamilton
lent
him
specimens
of
ancient
art
from
herculaneum
of
which
he
produced
accurate
and
beautiful
copies
the
duchess
of
portland
outbid
him
for
the
barberini
vase
when
that
article
was
offered
for
sale
he
bid
as
high
as
seventeen
hundred
guineas
for
it
her
grace
secured
it
for
eighteen
hundred
but
when
she
learnt
wedgwood
s
object
she
at
once
generously
lent
him
the
vase
to
copy
he
produced
fifty
copies
at
a
cost
of
about
and
his
expenses
were
not
covered
by
their
sale
but
he
gained
his
object
which
was
to
show
that
whatever
had
been
done
that
english
skill
and
energy
could
and
would
accomplish
wedgwood
called
to
his
aid
the
crucible
of
the
chemist
the
knowledge
of
the
antiquary
and
the
skill
of
the
artist
he
found
out
flaxman
when
a
youth
and
while
he
liberally
nurtured
his
genius
drew
from
him
a
large
number
of
beautiful
designs
for
his
pottery
and
porcelain
converting
them
by
his
manufacture
into
objects
of
taste
and
excellence
and
thus
making
them
instrumental
in
the
diffusion
of
classical
art
amongst
the
people
by
careful
experiment
and
study
he
was
even
enabled
to
rediscover
the
art
of
painting
on
porcelain
or
earthenware
vases
and
similar
art
practised
by
the
ancient
etruscans
but
which
had
been
lost
since
the
time
of
pliny
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
own
contributions
to
science
and
his
name
is
still
identified
with
the
pyrometer
which
he
invented
he
was
an
indefatigable
supporter
of
all
measures
of
public
utility
and
the
construction
of
the
trent
and
mersey
canal
which
completed
the
navigable
communication
between
the
eastern
and
western
sides
of
the
island
was
mainly
due
to
his
exertions
allied
to
the
engineering
skill
of
brindley
the
road
accommodation
of
the
district
being
of
an
execrable
character
he
planned
and
executed
a
through
the
potteries
ten
miles
in
length
the
reputation
he
achieved
was
such
that
his
works
at
burslem
and
subsequently
those
at
etruria
which
he
founded
and
built
became
a
point
of
attraction
to
distinguished
visitors
from
all
parts
of
europe
the
result
of
wedgwood
s
labours
was
that
the
manufacture
of
pottery
which
he
found
in
the
very
lowest
condition
became
one
of
the
staples
of
england
and
instead
of
importing
what
we
needed
for
home
use
from
abroad
we
became
large
exporters
to
other
countries
supplying
them
with
earthenware
even
in
the
face
of
enormous
prohibitory
duties
on
articles
of
british
produce
wedgwood
gave
evidence
as
to
his
manufactures
before
parliament
in
only
some
thirty
years
after
he
had
begun
his
operations
from
which
it
appeared
that
instead
of
providing
only
casual
employment
to
a
small
number
of
inefficient
and
badly
remunerated
workmen
about
persons
then
derived
their
bread
directly
from
the
manufacture
of
earthenware
without
taking
into
account
the
increased
numbers
to
which
it
gave
employment
in
and
in
the
carrying
trade
by
land
and
sea
and
the
stimulus
which
it
gave
to
employment
in
many
ways
in
various
parts
of
the
country
yet
important
as
had
been
the
advances
made
in
his
time
wedgwood
was
of
opinion
that
the
manufacture
was
but
in
its
infancy
and
that
the
improvements
which
he
had
effected
were
of
but
small
amount
compared
with
those
to
which
the
art
was
capable
of
attaining
through
the
continued
industry
and
growing
intelligence
of
the
manufacturers
and
the
natural
facilities
and
political
advantages
enjoyed
by
great
britain
an
opinion
which
has
been
fully
borne
out
by
the
progress
which
has
since
been
effected
in
this
important
branch
of
industry
in
not
fewer
than
pieces
of
pottery
were
exported
from
england
to
other
countries
besides
what
were
made
for
home
use
but
it
is
not
merely
the
quantity
and
value
of
the
produce
that
is
entitled
to
consideration
but
the
improvement
of
the
condition
of
the
population
by
whom
this
great
branch
of
industry
is
conducted
when
wedgwood
began
his
labours
the
staffordshire
district
was
only
in
a
state
the
people
were
poor
uncultivated
and
few
in
number
when
wedgwood
s
manufacture
was
firmly
established
there
was
found
ample
employment
at
good
wages
for
three
times
the
number
of
population
while
their
moral
advancement
had
kept
pace
with
their
material
improvement
men
such
as
these
are
fairly
entitled
to
take
rank
as
the
industrial
heroes
of
the
civilized
world
their
patient
amidst
trials
and
difficulties
their
courage
and
perseverance
in
the
pursuit
of
worthy
objects
are
not
less
heroic
of
their
kind
than
the
bravery
and
devotion
of
the
soldier
and
the
sailor
whose
duty
and
pride
it
is
heroically
to
defend
what
these
valiant
leaders
of

have
so
heroically
achieved

the
greatest
results
in

are

by
simple

the

often
been
blamed
for
her
blindness
but
fortune
is
not
so
blind
as
men
are
those
who
look
into

life
will
find
that
fortune
is
usually
on
the
side
of
the
industrious
as
the
winds
and

are
on
the
side
of
the
best
navigators
in

of
even
the
highest
branches
of
human
inquiry
the
commoner
qualities
are
found
the
most
as

application
and
perseverance
genius
may
not
be
necessary
though
even
genius
of
the
highest
sort
does
not
disdain
the
use
of
these
ordinary
qualities
the
very
greatest
men
have
been
among
the
least
believers
in
the
power
of
genius
and
as
worldly
wise
and
persevering
as
successful
men
of
the
commoner
sort
some
have
even
defined
genius
to
be
only
common

intensified
a
distinguished
teacher
and
president
of
a
college
spoke
of
it
as
the
power
of
making
efforts
john
foster
held
it
to
be
the
power
of
lighting

s
own
fire
buffon
said
of
genius
it
is
newton
s
was
unquestionably
a
mind
of
the
very
highest
order
and
yet
when
asked
by
what
means
he
had
worked
out
his
extraordinary
discoveries
he
modestly
answered
by
always
thinking
unto
at
another
time
he
thus
expressed
his
method
of
study
i
keep
the
subject
continually
before
me
and
wait
till
the
first
dawnings
open
slowly
by
little
and
little
into
a
full
and
clear
it
was
in
newton
s
case
as
in
every
other
only
by
diligent
application
and
perseverance
that
his
great
reputation
was
achieved
even
his
recreation
consisted
in
change
of
study
laying
down
one
subject
to
take
up
another
to
bentley
he
said
if
i
have
done
the
public
any
service
it
is
due
to
nothing
but
industry
and
patient
so
kepler
another
great
philosopher
speaking
of
his
studies
and
his
progress
said
as
in
virgil
fama
mobilitate
viget
vires
acquirit
eundo
so
it
was
with
me
that
the
diligent
thought
on
these
things
was
the
occasion
of
still
further
thinking
until
at
last
i
brooded
with
the
whole
energy
of
my
mind
upon
the
the
extraordinary
results
effected
by
dint
of
sheer
industry
and
perseverance
have
led
many
distinguished
men
to
doubt
whether
the
gift
of
genius
be
so
exceptional
an
endowment
as
it
is
usually
supposed
to
be
thus
voltaire
held
that
it
is
only
a
very
slight
line
of
separation
that
divides
the
man
of
genius
from
the
man
of
ordinary
mould
beccaria
was
even
of
opinion
that
all
men
might
be
poets
and
orators
and
reynolds
that
they
might
be
painters
and
sculptors
if
this
were
really
so
that
stolid
englishman
might
not
have
been
so
very
far
wrong
after
all
who
on
canova
s
death
inquired
of
his
brother
whether
it
was
his
intention
to
carry
on
the
business
locke
helvetius
and
diderot
believed
that
all
men
have
an
equal
aptitude
for
genius
and
that
what
some
are
able
to
effect
under
the
laws
which
regulate
the
operations
of
the
intellect
must
also
be
within
the
reach
of
others
who
under
like
circumstances
apply
themselves
to
like
pursuits
but
while
admitting
to
the
fullest
extent
the
wonderful
achievements
of
labour
and
recognising
the
fact
that
men
of
the
most
distinguished
genius
have
invariably
been
found
the
most
indefatigable
workers
it
must
nevertheless
be
sufficiently
obvious
that
without
the
original
endowment
of
heart
and
brain
no
amount
of
labour
however
well
applied
could
have
produced
a
shakespeare
a
newton
a
beethoven
or
a
michael
angelo
dalton
the
chemist
repudiated
the
notion
of
his
being
a
genius
attributing
everything
which
he
had
accomplished
to
simple
industry
and
accumulation
john
hunter
said
of
himself
my
mind
is
like
a
beehive
but
full
as
it
is
of
buzz
and
apparent
confusion
it
is
yet
full
of
order
and
regularity
and
food
collected
with
incessant
industry
from
the
choicest
stores
of
we
have
indeed
but
to
glance
at
the
biographies
of
great
men
to
find
that
the
most
distinguished
inventors
artists
thinkers
and
workers
of
all
kinds
owe
their
success
in
a
great
measure
to
their
indefatigable
industry
and
application
they
were
men
who
turned
all
things
to
time
itself
disraeli
the
elder
held
that
the
secret
of
success
consisted
in
being
master
of
your
subject
such
mastery
being
attainable
only
through
continuous
application
and
study
hence
it
happens
that
the
men
who
have
most
moved
the
world
have
not
been
so
much
men
of
genius
strictly
so
called
as
men
of
intense
mediocre
abilities
and
untiring
perseverance
not
so
often
the
gifted
of
naturally
bright
and
shining
qualities
as
those
who
have
applied
themselves
diligently
to
their
work
in
whatsoever
line
that
might
lie
alas
said
a
widow
speaking
of
her
brilliant
but
careless
son
he
has
not
the
gift
of
wanting
in
perseverance
such
volatile
natures
are
outstripped
in
the
race
of
life
by
the
diligent
and
even
the
dull
che
va
piano
va
longano
e
va
lontano
says
the
italian
proverb
who
goes
slowly
goes
long
and
goes
far
hence
a
great
point
to
be
aimed
at
is
to
get
the
working
quality
well
trained
when
that
is
done
the
race
will
be
found
comparatively
easy
we
must
repeat
and
again
repeat
facility
will
come
with
labour
not
even
the
simplest
art
can
be
accomplished
without
it
and
what
difficulties
it
is
found
capable
of
achieving
it
was
by
early
discipline
and
repetition
that
the
late
sir
robert
peel
cultivated
those
remarkable
though
still
mediocre
powers
which
rendered
him
so
illustrious
an
ornament
of
the
british
senate
when
a
boy
at
drayton
manor
his
father
was
accustomed
to
set
him
up
at
table
to
practise
speaking
extempore
and
he
early
accustomed
him
to
repeat
as
much
of
the
sunday
s
sermon
as
he
could
remember
little
progress
was
made
at
first
but
by
steady
perseverance
the
habit
of
attention
became
powerful
and
the
sermon
was
at
length
repeated
almost
verbatim
when
afterwards
replying
in
succession
to
the
arguments
of
his
parliamentary
art
in
which
he
was
perhaps
was
little
surmised
that
the
extraordinary
power
of
accurate
remembrance
which
he
displayed
on
such
occasions
had
been
originally
trained
under
the
discipline
of
his
father
in
the
parish
church
of
drayton
it
is
indeed
marvellous
what
continuous
application
will
effect
in
the
commonest
of
things
it
may
seem
a
simple
affair
to
play
upon
a
violin
yet
what
a
long
and
laborious
practice
it
requires
giardini
said
to
a
youth
who
asked
him
how

take

hours

years

toil

profitless
task

herself
for

exhibition

lesson
from

exhausted

and
resuscitated
totally
unconscious
the
agility
and
bounds
of
the
evening
were
insured
only
at
a
price
like
this
progress
however
of
the
best
kind
is
comparatively
slow
great
results
can
not
be
achieved
at
once
and
we
must
be
satisfied
to
advance
in
life
as
we

by

to
know
to
is
the
great
secret
of
we
must
sow

to

to
look
patiently

is
an
excellent
working
quality
imparting

elasticity
to
the

so
are
cheerfulness
and

of
practical
wisdom
they
are
the

as
of

one
of

of

was

the
missionary
when
in

it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
weary

pundits
who
officiated
as
his
clerks

one
day

himself
taking

was

by

the
son
of

and

son
of
a

by
their
labours
a

was
erected
at

sixteen
flourishing
stations
were
established

was
translated
into
sixteen
languages
and
the
seeds
were
sown
of
a
beneficent
moral
revolution
in
british

carey
was
never
ashamed
of
the
humbleness
of
his
origin
on
one
occasion
when
at
the
s
table
he
an
officer
opposite
him
asking
another
loud
enough
to
be
heard
whether
carey
had
not
once
been
a
shoemaker
no
sir
exclaimed
carey
immediately
only
a
an
eminently
characteristic
anecdote
has
been
told
of
his
perseverance
as
a
boy
when
climbing
a
tree
one
day
his
foot
slipped
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
breaking
his
leg
by
the
fall
he
was
confined
to
his
bed
for
weeks
but
when
he
recovered
and
was
able
to
walk
without
support
the
very
first
thing
he
did
was
to
go
and
climb
that
tree
carey
had
need
of
this
sort
of
dauntless
courage
for
the
great
missionary
work
of
his
life
and
nobly
and
resolutely
he
did
it
it
was
a
maxim
of
young
the
philosopher
that
any
man
can
do
what
any
other
man
has
done
and
it
is
unquestionable
that
he
himself
never
recoiled
from
any
trials
to
which
he
determined
to
subject
himself
it
is
related
of
him
that
the
first
time
he
mounted
a
horse
he
was
in
company
with
the
grandson
of
barclay
of
ury
the
sportsman
when
the
horseman
who
preceded
them
leapt
a
high
fence
young
wished
to
imitate
him
but
fell
off
his
horse
in
the
attempt
without
saying
a
word
he
remounted
made
a
second
effort
and
was
again
unsuccessful
but
this
time
he
was
not
thrown
further
than
on
to
the
horse
s
neck
to
which
he
clung
at
the
third
trial
he
succeeded
and
cleared
the
fence
the
story
of
timour
the
tartar
learning
a
lesson
of
perseverance
under
adversity
from
the
spider
is
well
known
not
less
interesting
is
the
anecdote
of
audubon
the
american
ornithologist
as
related
by
himself
an
accident
he
says
which
happened
to
two
hundred
of
my
original
drawings
nearly
put
a
stop
to
my
researches
in
ornithology
i
shall
relate
it
merely
to
show
how
far
by
no
other
name
can
i
call
my
enable
the
preserver
of
nature
to
surmount
the
most
disheartening
difficulties
i
left
the
village
of
henderson
in
kentucky
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
ohio
where
i
resided
for
several
years
to
proceed
to
philadelphia
on
business
i
looked
to
my
drawings
before
my
departure
placed
them
carefully
in
a
wooden
box
and
gave
them
in
charge
of
a
relative
with
injunctions
to
see
that
no
injury
should
happen
to
them
my
absence
was
of
several
months
and
when
i
returned
after
having
enjoyed
the
pleasures
of
home
for
a
few
days
i
inquired
after
my
box
and
what
i
was
pleased
to
call
my
treasure
the
box
was
produced
and
opened
but
reader
feel
for
pair
of
norway
rats
had
taken
possession
of
the
whole
and
reared
a
young
family
among
the
gnawed
bits
of
paper
which
but
a
month
previous
represented
nearly
a
thousand
inhabitants
of
air
the
burning
beat
which
instantly
rushed
through
my
brain
was
too
great
to
be
endured
without
affecting
my
whole
nervous
system
i
slept
for
several
nights
and
the
days
passed
like
days
of
the
animal
powers
being
recalled
into
action
through
the
strength
of
my
constitution
i
took
up
my
gun
my
notebook
and
my
pencils
and
went
forth
to
the
woods
as
gaily
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
felt
pleased
that
i
might
now
make
better
drawings
than
before
and
ere
a
period
not
exceeding
three
years
had
elapsed
my
portfolio
was
again
the
accidental
destruction
of
sir
isaac
newton
s
papers
by
his
little
dog
diamond
upsetting
a
lighted
taper
upon
his
desk
by
which
the
elaborate
calculations
of
many
years
were
in
a
moment
destroyed
is
a
anecdote
and
need
not
be
repeated
it
is
said
that
the
loss
caused
the
philosopher
such
profound
grief
that
it
seriously
injured
his
health
and
impaired
his
understanding
an
accident
of
a
somewhat
similar
kind
happened
to
the
of
carlyle
s
first
volume
of
his
french
he
had
lent
the
to
a
literary
neighbour
to
peruse
by
some
mischance
it
had
been
left
lying
on
the
parlour
floor
and
become
forgotten
weeks
ran
on
and
the
historian
sent
for
his
work
the
printers
being
loud
for
inquiries
were
made
and
it
was
found
that
the
finding
what
she
conceived
to
be
a
bundle
of
waste
paper
on
the
floor
had
used
it
to
light
the
kitchen
and
parlour
fires
with
such
was
the
answer
returned
to
carlyle
and
his
feelings
may
be
imagined
there
was
however
no
help
for
him
but
to
set
resolutely
to
work
to
the
book
and
he
turned
to
and
did
it
he
had
no
draft
and
was
compelled
to
rake
up
from
his
memory
facts
ideas
and
expressions
which
had
been
long
since
dismissed
the
composition
of
the
book
in
the
first
instance
had
been
a
work
of
pleasure
the
of
it
a
second
time
was
one
of
pain
and
anguish
almost
beyond
belief
that
he
persevered
and
finished
the
volume
under
such
circumstances
affords
an
instance
of
determination
of
purpose
which
has
seldom
been
surpassed
the
lives
of
eminent
inventors
are
eminently
illustrative
of
the
same
quality
of
perseverance
george
stephenson
when
addressing
young
men
was
accustomed
to
sum
up
his
best
advice
to
them
in
the
words
do
as
i
have
he
had
worked
at
the
improvement
of
his
locomotive
for
some
fifteen
years
before
achieving
his
decisive
victory
at
rainhill
and
watt
was
engaged
for
some
thirty
years
upon
the
before
he
brought
it
to
perfection
but
there
are
equally
striking
illustrations
of
perseverance
to
be
found
in
every
other
branch
of
science
art
and
industry
perhaps
one
of
the
most
interesting
is
that
connected
with
the
disentombment
of
the
nineveh
marbles
and
the
discovery
of
the
cuneiform
or
character
in
which
the
inscriptions
on
them
are
kind
of
writing
which
had
been
lost
to
the
world
since
the
period
of
the
macedonian
conquest
of
persia
an
intelligent
cadet
of
the
east
india
company
stationed
at
kermanshah
in
persia
had
observed
the
curious
cuneiform
inscriptions
on
the
old
monuments
in
the
old
that
all
historical
traces
of
them
had
been
lost
amongst
the
inscriptions
which
he
copied
was
that
on
the
celebrated
rock
of
perpendicular
rock
rising
abruptly
some
feet
from
the
plain
the
lower
part
bearing
inscriptions
for
the
space
of
about
feet
in
three
scythian
and
assyrian
comparison
of
the
known
with
the
unknown
of
the
language
which
survived
with
the
language
that
had
been
lost
enabled
this
cadet
to
acquire
some
knowledge
of
the
cuneiform
character
and
even
to
form
an
alphabet
afterwards
sir
henry
rawlinson
sent
his
tracings
home
for
examination
no
professors
in
colleges
as
yet
knew
anything
of
the
cuneiform
character
but
there
was
a
clerk
of
the
east
india
modest
unknown
man
of
the
name
of
had
made
this
subject
his
study
to
whom
the
tracings
were
submitted
and
so
accurate
was
his
knowledge
that
though
he
had
never
seen
the
behistun
rock
he
pronounced
that
the
cadet
had
not
copied
the
puzzling
inscription
with
proper
exactness
rawlinson
who
was
still
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
rock
compared
his
copy
with
the
original
and
found
that
norris
was
right
and
by
further
comparison
and
careful
study
the
knowledge
of
the
cuneiform
writing
was
thus
greatly
advanced
but
to
make
the
learning
of
these
two
men
of
avail
a
third
labourer
was
necessary
in
order
to
supply
them
with
material
for
the
exercise
of
their
skill
such
a
labourer
presented
himself
in
the
person
of
austen
layard
originally
an
articled
clerk
in
the
office
of
a
london
solicitor
one
would
scarcely
have
expected
to
find
in
these
three
men
a
cadet
an
clerk
and
a
lawyer
s
clerk
the
discoverers
of
a
forgotten
language
and
of
the
buried
history
of
babylon
yet
it
was
so
layard
was
a
youth
of
only
travelling
in
the
east
when
he
was
possessed
with
a
desire
to
penetrate
the
regions
beyond
the
euphrates
accompanied
by
a
single
companion
trusting
to
his
arms
for
protection
and
what
was
better
to
his
cheerfulness
politeness
and
chivalrous
bearing
he
passed
safely
amidst
tribes
at
deadly
war
with
each
other
and
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
with
comparatively
slender
means
at
his
command
but
aided
by
application
and
perseverance
resolute
will
and
purpose
and
almost
sublime
patience
up
throughout
by
his
passionate
enthusiasm
for
discovery
and
research
succeeded
in
laying
bare
and
digging
up
an
amount
of
historical
treasures
the
like
of
which
has
probably
never
before
been
collected
by
the
industry
of
any
one
man
not
less
than
two
miles
of
were
thus
brought
to
light
by
layard
the
selection
of
these
valuable
antiquities
now
placed
in
the
british
museum
was
found
so
curiously
corroborative
of
the
scriptural
records
of
events
which
occurred
some
three
thousand
years
ago
that
they
burst
upon
the
world
almost
like
a
new
revelation
and
the
story
of
the
disentombment
of
these
remarkable
works
as
told
by
layard
himself
in
his
monuments
of
nineveh
will
always
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
charming
and
unaffected
records
which
we
possess
of
individual
enterprise
industry
and
energy
the
career
of
the
comte
de
buffon
presents
another
remarkable
illustration
of
the
power
of
patient
industry
as
well
as
of
his
own
saying
that
genius
is
notwithstanding
the
great
results
achieved
by
him
in
natural
history
buffon
when
a
youth
was
regarded
as
of
mediocre
talents
his
mind
was
slow
in
forming
itself
and
slow
in
reproducing
what
it
had
acquired
he
was
also
constitutionally
indolent
and
being
born
to
good
estate
it
might
be
supposed
that
he
would
indulge
his
liking
for
ease
and
luxury
instead
of
which
he
early
formed
the
resolution
of
denying
himself
pleasure
and
devoting
himself
to
study
and
regarding
time
as
a
treasure
that
was
limited
and
finding
that
he
was
losing
many
hours
by
lying
in
the
mornings
he
determined
to
break
himself
of
the
habit
he
struggled
hard
against
it
for
some
time
but
failed
in
being
able
to
rise
at
the
hour
he
had
fixed
he
then
called
his
servant
joseph
to
his
help
and
promised
him
the
reward
of
a
crown
every
time
that
he
succeeded
in
getting
him
up
before
six
at
first
when
called
buffon
declined
to
that
he
was
ill
or
pretended
anger
at
being
disturbed
and
on
the
count
at
length
getting
up
joseph
found
that
he
had
earned
nothing
but
reproaches
for
having
permitted
his
master
to
lie
contrary
to
his
express
orders
at
length
the
valet
determined
to
earn
his
crown
and
again
and
again
he
forced
buffon
to
rise
notwithstanding
his
entreaties
expostulations
and
threats
of
immediate
discharge
from
his
service
one
morning
buffon
was
unusually
obstinate
and
joseph
found
it
necessary
to
resort
to
the
extreme
measure
of
dashing
a
basin
of
water
under
the
the
effect
of
which
was
instantaneous
by
the
persistent
use
of
such
means
buffon
at
length
conquered
his
habit
and
he
was
accustomed
to
say
that
he
owed
to
joseph
three
or
four
volumes
of
his
natural
history
for
forty
years
of
his
life
buffon
worked
every
morning
at
his
desk
from
nine
till
two
and
again
in
the
evening
from
five
till
nine
his
diligence
was
so
continuous
and
so
regular
that
it
became
habitual
his
biographer
has
said
of
him
work
was
his
necessity
his
studies
were
the
charm
of
his
life
and
towards
the
last
term
of
his
glorious
career
he
frequently
said
that
he
still
hoped
to
be
able
to
consecrate
to
them
a
few
more
he
was
a
most
conscientious
worker
always
studying
to
give
the
reader
his
best
thoughts
expressed
in
the
very
best
manner
he
was
never
wearied
with
touching
and
retouching
his
compositions
so
that
his
style
may
be
pronounced
almost
perfect
he
wrote
the
epoques
de
la
nature
not
fewer
than
eleven
times
before
he
was
satisfied
with
it
although
he
had
thought
over
the
work
about
fifty
years
he
was
a
thorough
man
of
business
most
orderly
in
everything
and
he
was
accustomed
to
say
that
genius
without
order
lost
of
its
power
his
great
success
as
a
writer
was
the
result
mainly
of
his
painstaking
labour
and
diligent
application
buffon
observed
madame
necker
strongly
persuaded
that
genius
is
the
result
of
a
profound
attention
directed
to
a
particular
subject
said
that
he
was
thoroughly
wearied
out
when
composing
his
first
writings
but
compelled
himself
to
return
to
them
and
go
over
them
carefully
again
even
when
he
thought
he
had
already
brought
them
to
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
and
that
at
length
he
found
pleasure
instead
of
weariness
in
this
long
and
elaborate
it
ought
also
to
be
added
that
buffon
wrote
and
published
all
his
great
works
while
afflicted
by
one
of
the
most
painful
diseases
to
which
the
human
frame
is
subject
literary
life
affords
abundant
illustrations
of
the
same
power
of
perseverance
and
perhaps
no
career
is
more
instructive
viewed
in
this
light
than
that
of
sir
walter
scott
his
admirable
working
qualities
were
trained
in
a
lawyer
s
office
where
he
pursued
for
many
years
a
sort
of
drudgery
scarcely
above
that
of
a
copying
clerk
his
daily
dull
routine
made
his
evenings
which
were
his
own
all
the
more
sweet
and
he
generally
devoted
them
to
reading
and
study
he
himself
attributed
to
his
prosaic
office
discipline
that
habit
of
steady
sober
diligence
in
which
mere
literary
men
are
so
often
found
wanting
as
a
copying
clerk
he
was
allowed
for
every
page
containing
a
certain
number
of
words
and
he
sometimes
by
extra
work
was
able
to
copy
as
many
as
pages
in
hours
thus
earning
some
out
of
which
he
would
occasionally
purchase
an
odd
volume
otherwise
beyond
his
means
during
his
scott
was
wont
to
pride
himself
upon
being
a
man
of
business
and
he
averred
in
contradiction
to
what
he
called
the
cant
of
sonneteers
that
there
was
no
necessary
connection
between
genius
and
an
aversion
or
contempt
for
the
common
duties
of
life
on
the
contrary
he
was
of
opinion
that
to
spend
some
fair
portion
of
every
day
in
any
occupation
was
good
for
the
higher
faculties
themselves
in
the
upshot
while
afterwards
acting
as
clerk
to
the
court
of
session
in
edinburgh
he
performed
his
literary
work
chiefly
before
breakfast
attending
the
court
during
the
day
where
he
authenticated
registered
deeds
and
writings
of
various
kinds
on
the
whole
says
lockhart
it
forms
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
in
his
history
that
throughout
the
most
active
period
of
his
literary
career
he
must
have
devoted
a
large
proportion
of
his
hours
during
half
at
least
of
every
year
to
the
conscientious
discharge
of
professional
it
was
a
principle
of
action
which
he
laid
down
for
himself
that
he
must
earn
his
living
by
business
and
not
by
literature
on
one
occasion
he
said
i
determined
that
literature
should
be
my
staff
not
my
crutch
and
that
the
profits
of
my
literary
labour
however
convenient
otherwise
should
not
if
i
could
help
it
become
necessary
to
my
ordinary
his
punctuality
was
one
of
the
most
carefully
cultivated
of
his
habits
otherwise
it
had
not
been
possible
for
him
to
get
through
so
enormous
an
amount
of
literary
labour
he
made
it
a
rule
to
answer
every
letter
received
by
him
on
the
same
day
except
where
inquiry
and
deliberation
were
requisite
nothing
else
could
have
enabled
him
to
keep
abreast
with
the
flood
of
communications
that
poured
in
upon
him
and
sometimes
put
his
good
nature
to
the
severest
test
it
was
his
practice
to
rise
by
five
o
clock
and
light
his
own
fire
he
shaved
and
dressed
with
deliberation
and
was
seated
at
his
desk
by
six
o
clock
with
his
papers
arranged
before
him
in
the
most
accurate
order
his
works
of
reference
marshalled
round
him
on
the
floor
while
at
least
one
favourite
dog
lay
watching
his
eye
outside
the
line
of
books
thus
by
the
time
the
family
assembled
for
breakfast
between
nine
and
ten
he
had
done
use
his
own
break
the
neck
of
the
day
s
work
but
with
all
his
diligent
and
indefatigable
industry
and
his
immense
knowledge
the
result
of
many
years
patient
labour
scott
always
spoke
with
the
greatest
diffidence
of
his
own
powers
on
one
occasion
he
said
throughout
every
part
of
my
career
i
have
felt
pinched
and
hampered
by
my
own
such
is
true
wisdom
and
humility
for
the
more
a
man
really
knows
the
less
conceited
he
will
be
the
student
at
trinity
college
who
went
up
to
his
professor
to
take
leave
of
him
because
he
had
finished
his
education
was
wisely
rebuked
by
the
professor
s
reply
indeed
i
am
only
beginning
the
superficial
person
who
has
obtained
a
smattering
of
many
things
but
knows
nothing
well
may
pride
himself
upon
his
gifts
but
the
sage
humbly
confesses
that
all
he
knows
is
that
he
knows
nothing
or
like
newton
that
he
has
been
only
engaged
in
picking
shells
by
the
sea
shore
while
the
great
ocean
of
truth
lies
all
unexplored
before
him
the
lives
of
literary
men
furnish
equally
remarkable
illustrations
of
the
power
of
perseverance
the
late
john
britton
author
of
the
beauties
of
england
and
wales
and
of
many
valuable
architectural
works
was
born
in
a
miserable
cot
in
kingston
wiltshire
his
father
had
been
a
baker
and
maltster
but
was
ruined
in
trade
and
became
insane
while
britton
was
yet
a
child
the
boy
received
very
little
schooling
but
a
great
deal
of
bad
example
which
happily
did
not
corrupt
him
he
was
early
in
life
set
to
labour
with
an
uncle
a
in
clerkenwell
under
whom
he
bottled
corked
and
binned
wine
for
more
than
five
years
his
health
failing
him
his
uncle
turned
him
adrift
in
the
world
with
only
two
guineas
the
fruits
of
his
five
years
service
in
his
pocket
during
the
next
seven
years
of
his
life
he
endured
many
vicissitudes
and
hardships
yet
he
says
in
his
autobiography
in
my
poor
and
obscure
lodgings
at
eighteenpence
a
week
i
indulged
in
study
and
often
read
in
bed
during
the
winter
evenings
because
i
could
not
afford
a
travelling
on
foot
to
bath
he
there
obtained
an
engagement
as
a
cellarman
but
shortly
after
we
find
him
back
in
the
metropolis
again
almost
penniless
shoeless
and
shirtless
he
succeeded
however
in
obtaining
employment
as
a
cellarman
at
the
london
tavern
where
it
was
his
duty
to
be
in
the
cellar
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
eleven
at
night
his
health
broke
down
under
this
confinement
in
the
dark
added
to
the
heavy
work
and
he
then
engaged
himself
at
fifteen
shillings
a
week
to
an
attorney
he
had
been
diligently
cultivating
the
art
of
writing
during
the
few
spare
minutes
that
he
could
call
his
own
while
in
this
employment
he
devoted
his
leisure
principally
to
perambulating
the
bookstalls
where
he
read
books
by
snatches
which
he
could
not
buy
and
thus
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
odd
knowledge
then
he
shifted
to
another
office
at
the
advanced
wages
of
twenty
shillings
a
week
still
reading
and
studying
at
he
was
able
to
write
a
book
which
he
published
under
the
title
of
the
enterprising
adventures
of
pizarro
and
from
that
time
until
his
death
during
a
period
of
about
years
britton
was
occupied
in
laborious
literary
occupation
the
number
of
his
published
works
is
not
fewer
than
the
most
important
being
the
cathedral
antiquities
of
england
in
fourteen
volumes

truly
magnificent

the

was
a
man
of
somewhat
similar
character
possessed
of
an
extraordinary
working
power
the
son
of
a
farmer
near
edinburgh
he
was
early
inured
to
work
his
skill
in
drawing
plans
and
making
sketches
of

to

him
for

apprenticeship
he
sat
up
two
whole
nights
every
week
to
study
yet
he
worked
harder
during
the
day
than
any
labourer
in
the
course
of
his
night
studies
he
learnt
french
and
before
he
was
eighteen
he
translated
a
life
of
abelard
for
an
encyclopædia
he
was
so
eager
to
make
progress
in
life
that
when
only
twenty
while
working
as
a
gardener
in
england
he
wrote
down
in
his
i
am
now
twenty
years
of
age
and
perhaps
a
third
part
of
my
life
has
passed
away
and
yet
what
have
i
done
to
benefit
my
fellow
men
an
unusual
reflection
for
a
youth
of
only
twenty
from
french
he
proceeded
to
learn
german
and
rapidly
mastered
that
language
having
taken
a
large
farm
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
scotch
improvements
in
the
art
of
agriculture
he
shortly
succeeded
in
realising
a
considerable
income
the
continent
being
thrown
open
at
the
end
of
the
war
he
travelled
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
the
system
of
gardening
and
agriculture
in
other
countries
he
twice
repeated
his
journeys
and
the
results
were
published
in
his
encyclopædias
which
are
among
the
most
remarkable
works
of
their
kind
for
the
immense
mass
of
useful
matter
which
they
contain
collected
by
an
amount
of
industry
and
labour
which
has
rarely
been
equalled
the
career
of
samuel
drew
is
not
less
remarkable
than
any
of
those
which
we
have
cited
his
father
was
a
labourer
of
the
parish
of
austell
in
cornwall
though
poor
he
contrived
to
send
his
two
sons
to
a
school
in
the
neighbourhood
jabez
the
elder
took
delight
in
learning
and
made
great
progress
in
his
lessons
but
samuel
the
younger
was
a
dunce
notoriously
given
to
mischief
and
playing
truant
when
about
eight
years
old
he
was
put
to
manual
labour
earning
a
day
as
a
at
a
tin
mine
at
ten
he
was
apprenticed
to
a
shoemaker
and
while
in
this
employment
he
endured
much
hardship
as
he
used
to
say
like
a
toad
under
a
he
often
thought
of
running
away
and
becoming
a
pirate
or
something
of
the
sort
and
he
seems
to
have
grown
in
recklessness
as
he
grew
in
years
in
robbing
orchards
he
was
usually
a
leader
and
as
he
grew
older
he
delighted
to
take
part
in
any
poaching
or
smuggling
adventure
when
about
seventeen
before
his
apprenticeship
was
out
he
ran
away
intending
to
enter
on
board
a
but
sleeping
in
a
at
night
cooled
him
a
little
and
he
returned
to
his
trade
drew
next
removed
to
the
neighbourhood
of
plymouth
to
work
at
his
shoemaking
business
and
while
at
cawsand
he
won
a
prize
for
in
which
he
seems
to
have
been
an
adept
while
living
there
he
had
nearly
lost
his
life
in
a
smuggling
exploit
which
he
had
joined
partly
induced
by
the
love
of
adventure
and
partly
by
the
love
of
gain
for
his
regular
wages
were
not
more
than
eight
shillings
one
night
notice
was
given
throughout
crafthole
that
a
smuggler
was
off
the
coast
ready
to
land
her
cargo
on
which
the
male
population
of
the
all
for
the
shore
one
party
remained
on
the
rocks
to
make
signals
and
dispose
of
the
goods
as
they
were
landed
and
another
manned
the
boats
drew
being
of
the
latter
party
the
night
was
intensely
dark
and
very
little
of
the
cargo
had
been
landed
when
the
wind
rose
with
a
heavy
sea
the
men
in
the
boats
however
determined
to
persevere
and
several
trips
were
made
between
the
smuggler
now
standing
farther
out
to
sea
and
the
shore
one
of
the
men
in
the
boat
in
which
drew
was
had
his
hat
blown
off
by
the
wind
and
in
attempting
to
recover
it
the
boat
was
upset
three
of
the
men
were
immediately
drowned
the
others
clung
to
the
boat
for
a
time
but
finding
it
drifting
out
to
sea
they
took
to
swimming
they
were
two
miles
from
land
and
the
night
was
intensely
dark
after
being
about
three
hours
in
the
water
drew
reached
a
rock
near
the
shore
with
one
or
two
others
where
he
remained
benumbed
with
cold
till
morning
when
he
and
his
companions
were
discovered
and
taken
off
more
dead
than
alive
a
keg
of
brandy
from
the
cargo
just
landed
was
brought
the
head
knocked
in
with
a
hatchet
and
a
bowlfull
of
the
liquid
presented
to
the
survivors
and
shortly
after
drew
was
able
to
walk
two
miles
through
deep
snow
to
his
lodgings
this
was
a
very
unpromising
beginning
of
a
life
and
yet
this
same
drew
scapegrace
shoemaker
and
smuggler
outlived
the
recklessness
of
his
youth
and
became
distinguished
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
a
writer
of
good
books
happily
before
it
was
too
late
the
energy
which
characterised
him
was
turned
into
a
more
healthy
direction
and
rendered
him
as
eminent
in
usefulness
as
he
had
before
been
in
wickedness
his
father
again
took
him
back
to
austell
and
found
employment
for
him
as
a
journeyman
shoemaker
perhaps
his
recent
escape
from
death
had
tended
to
make
the
young
man
serious
as
we
shortly
find
him
attracted
by
the
forcible
preaching
of
adam
clarke
a
minister
of
the
wesleyan
methodists
his
brother
having
died
about
the
same
time
the
impression
of
seriousness
was
deepened
and
thenceforward
he
was
an
altered
man
he
began
anew
the
work
of
education
for
he
had
almost
forgotten
how
to
read
and
write
and
even
after
several
years
practice
a
friend
compared
his
writing
to
the
traces
of
a
spider
dipped
in
ink
set
to
crawl
upon
paper
speaking
of
himself
about
that
time
drew
afterwards
said
the
more
i
read
the
more
i
felt
my
own
ignorance
and
the
more
i
felt
my
ignorance
the
more
invincible
became
my
energy
to
surmount
it
every
leisure
moment
was
now
employed
in
reading
one
thing
or
another
having
to
support
myself
by
manual
labour
my
time
for
reading
was
but
little
and
to
overcome
this
disadvantage
my
usual
method
was
to
place
a
book
before
me
while
at
meat
and
at
every
repast
i
read
five
or
six
the
perusal
of
locke
s
essay
on
the
understanding
gave
the
first
metaphysical
turn
to
his
mind
it
awakened
me
from
my
stupor
said
he
and
induced
me
to
form
a
resolution
to
abandon
the
grovelling
views
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
drew
began
business
on
his
own
account
with
a
capital
of
a
few
shillings
but
his
character
for
steadiness
was
such
that
a
neighbouring
miller
offered
him
a
loan
which
was
accepted
and
success
attending
his
industry
the
debt
was
repaid
at
the
end
of
a
year
he
started
with
a
determination
to
owe
no
man
anything
and
he
held
to
it
in
the
midst
of
many
privations
often
he
went
to
bed
supperless
to
avoid
rising
in
debt
his
ambition
was
to
achieve
independence
by
industry
and
economy
and
in
this
he
gradually
succeeded
in
the
midst
of
incessant
labour
he
sedulously
strove
to
improve
his
mind
studying
astronomy
history
and
metaphysics
he
was
induced
to
pursue
the
latter
study
chiefly
because
it
required
fewer
books
to
consult
than
either
of
the
others
it
appeared
to
be
a
thorny
path
he
said
but
i
determined
nevertheless
to
enter
and
accordingly
began
to
tread
added
to
his
labours
in
shoemaking
and
metaphysics
drew
became
a
local
preacher
and
a
class
leader
he
took
an
eager
interest
in
politics
and
his
shop
became
a
favourite
resort
with
the
village
politicians
and
when
they
did
not
come
to
him
he
went
to
them
to
talk
over
public
affairs
this
so
encroached
upon
his
time
that
he
found
it
necessary
sometimes
to
work
until
midnight
to
make
up
for
the
hours
lost
during
the
day
his
political
fervour
become
the
talk
of
the
village
while
busy
one
night
hammering
away
at
a
a
little
boy
seeing
a
light
in
the
shop
put
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
of
the
door
and
called
out
in
a
shrill
pipe
shoemaker
work
by
night
and
run
about
by
day
a
friend
to
whom
drew
afterwards
told
the
story
asked
and
did
not
you
run
after
the
boy
and
strap
him
no
no
was
the
reply
had
a
pistol
been
fired
off
at
my
ear
i
could
not
have
been
more
dismayed
or
confounded
i
dropped
my
work
and
said
to
myself
true
true
but
you
shall
never
have
that
to
say
of
me
to
me
that
cry
was
as
the
voice
of
god
and
it
has
been
a
word
in
season
throughout
my
life
i
learnt
from
it
not
to
leave
till
the
work
of
or
to
idle
when
i
ought
to
be
from
that
moment
drew
dropped
politics
and
stuck
to
his
work
reading
and
studying
in
his
spare
hours
but
he
never
allowed
the
latter
pursuit
to
interfere
with
his
business
though
it
frequently
broke
in
upon
his
rest
he
married
and
thought
of
emigrating
to
america
but
he
remained
working
on
his
literary
taste
first
took
the
direction
of
poetical
composition
and
from
some
of
the
fragments
which
have
been
preserved
it
appears
that
his
speculations
as
to
the
immateriality
and
immortality
of
the
soul
had
their
origin
in
these
poetical
musings
his
study
was
the
kitchen
where
his
wife
s
bellows
served
him
for
a
desk
and
he
wrote
amidst
the
cries
and
cradlings
of
his
children
paine
s
age
of
reason
having
appeared
about
this
time
and
excited
much
interest
he
composed
a
pamphlet
in
refutation
of
its
arguments
which
was
published
he
used
afterwards
to
say
that
it
was
the
age
of
reason
that
made
him
an
author
various
pamphlets
from
his
pen
shortly
appeared
in
rapid
succession
and
a
few
years
later
while
still
working
at
shoemaking
he
wrote
and
published
his
admirable
essay
on
the
immateriality
and
immortality
of
the
human
soul
which
he
sold
for
twenty
pounds
a
great
sum
in
his
estimation
at
the
time
the
book
went
through
many
editions
and
is
still
prized
drew
was
in
no
wise
puffed
up
by
his
success
as
many
young
authors
are
but
long
after
he
had
become
celebrated
as
a
writer
used
to
be
seen
sweeping
the
street
before
his
door
or
helping
his
apprentices
to
carry
in
the
winter
s
coals
nor
could
he
for
some
time
bring
himself
to
regard
literature
as
a
profession
to
live
by
his
first
care
was
to
secure
an
honest
livelihood
by
his
business
and
to
put
into
the
lottery
of
literary
success
as
he
termed
it
only
the
surplus
of
his
time
at
length
however
he
devoted
himself
wholly
to
literature
more
particularly
in
connection
with
the
wesleyan
body
editing
one
of
their
magazines
and
superintending
the
publication
of
several
of
their
denominational
works
he
also
wrote
in
the
eclectic
review
and
compiled
and
published
a
valuable
history
of
his
native
county
cornwall
with
numerous
other
works
towards
the
close
of
his
career
he
said
of
himself
raised
from
one
of
the
lowest
stations
in
society
i
have
endeavoured
through
life
to
bring
my
family
into
a
state
of
respectability
by
honest
industry
frugality
and
a
high
regard
for
my
moral
character
divine
providence
has
smiled
on
my
exertions
and
crowned
my
wishes
with
the
late
joseph
hume
pursued
a
very
different
career
but
worked
in
an
equally
persevering
spirit
he
was
a
man
of
moderate
parts
but
of
great
industry
and
unimpeachable
honesty
of
purpose
the
motto
of
his
life
was
perseverance
and
well
he
acted
up
to
it
his
father
dying
while
he
was
a
mere
child
his
mother
opened
a
small
shop
in
montrose
and
toiled
hard
to
maintain
her
family
and
bring
them
up
respectably
joseph
she
put
apprentice
to
a
surgeon
and
educated
for
the
medical
profession
having
got
his
diploma
he
made
several
voyages
to
india
as
ship
s
surgeon
and
afterwards
obtained
a
cadetship
in
the
company
s
service
none
worked
harder
or
lived
more
temperately
than
he
did
and
securing
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
who
found
him
a
capable
man
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
they
gradually
promoted
him
to
higher
offices
in
he
was
with
the
division
of
the
army
under
general
powell
in
the
mahratta
war
and
the
interpreter
having
died
hume
who
had
meanwhile
studied
and
mastered
the
native
languages
was
appointed
in
his
stead
he
was
next
made
chief
of
the
medical
staff
but
as
if
this
were
not
enough
to
occupy
his
full
working
power
he
undertook
in
addition
the
offices
of
paymaster
and
and
filled
them
satisfactorily
he
also
contracted
to
supply
the
commissariat
which
he
did
with
advantage
to
the
army
and
profit
to
himself
after
about
ten
years
unremitting
labour
he
returned
to
england
with
a
competency
and
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
make
provision
for
the
poorer
members
of
his
family
but
joseph
hume
was
not
a
man
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
industry
in
idleness
work
and
occupation
had
become
necessary
for
his
comfort
and
happiness
to
make
himself
fully
acquainted
with
the
actual
state
of
his
own
country
and
the
condition
of
the
people
he
visited
every
town
in
the
kingdom
which
then
enjoyed
any
degree
of
manufacturing
celebrity
he
afterwards
travelled
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
knowledge
of
foreign
states
returned
to
england
he
entered
parliament
in
and
continued
a
member
of
that
assembly
with
a
short
interruption
for
a
period
of
about
years
his
first
recorded
speech
was
on
the
subject
of
public
education
and
throughout
his
long
and
honourable
career
he
took
an
active
and
earnest
interest
in
that
and
all
other
questions
calculated
to
elevate
and
improve
the
condition
of
the
reform
free
trade
economy
and
retrenchment
extended
representation
and
such
like
measures
all
of
which
he
indefatigably
promoted
whatever
subject
he
undertook
he
worked
at
with
all
his
might
he
was
not
a
good
speaker
but
what
he
said
was
believed
to
proceed
from
the
lips
of
an
honest
accurate
man
if
ridicule
as
shaftesbury
says
be
the
test
of
truth
joseph
hume
stood
the
test
well
no
man
was
more
laughed
at
but
there
he
stood
perpetually
and
literally
at
his
he
was
usually
beaten
on
a
division
but
the
influence
which
he
exercised
was
nevertheless
felt
and
many
important
financial
improvements
were
effected
by
him
even
with
the
vote
directly
against
him
the
amount
of
hard
work
which
he
contrived
to
get
through
was
something
extraordinary
he
rose
at
six
wrote
letters
and
arranged
his
papers
for
parliament
then
after
breakfast
he
received
persons
on
business
sometimes
as
many
as
twenty
in
a
morning
the
house
rarely
assembled
without
him
and
though
the
debate
might
be
prolonged
to
two
or
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
his
name
was
seldom
found
absent
from
the
division
in
short
to
perform
the
work
which
he
did
extending
over
so
long
a
period
in
the
face
of
so
many
administrations
week
after
week
year
after
year
be
outvoted
beaten
laughed
at
standing
on
many
occasions
almost
alone
persevere
in
the
face
of
every
discouragement
preserving
his
temper
unruffled
never
relaxing
in
his
energy
or
his
hope
and
living
to
see
the
greater
number
of
his
measures
adopted
with
acclamation
must
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
illustrations
of
the
power
of
human
perseverance
that
biography
can
exhibit
chapter
helps
and
pursuits
neither
the
naked
hand
nor
the
understanding
left
to
itself
can
do
much
the
work
is
accomplished
by
instruments
and
helps
of
which
the
need
is
not
less
for
the
understanding
than
the
opportunity

when
he
had
nearly
finished
a
picture
in
a
tame
correct
manner
he
would
step
back
from
it
his
pencil
fixed
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
and
after
gazing
earnestly
on
the
work
he
would
suddenly
walk
up
and
by
a
few
bold
touches
give
a
brilliant
finish
to
the
painting
but
it
will
not
do
for
every
one
who
would
produce
an
effect
to
throw
his
brush
at
the
canvas
in
the
hope
of
producing
a
picture
the
capability
of
putting
in
these
last
vital
touches
is
acquired
only
by
the
labour
of
a
life
and
the
probability
is
that
the
artist
who
has
not
carefully
trained
himself
beforehand
in
attempting
to
produce
a
brilliant
effect
at
a
dash
will
only
produce
a
blotch
sedulous
attention
and
painstaking
industry
always
mark
the
true
worker
the
greatest
men
are
not
those
who
despise
the
day
of
small
things
but
those
who
improve
them
the
most
carefully
michael
angelo
was
one
day
explaining
to
a
visitor
at
his
studio
what
he
had
been
doing
at
a
statue
since
his
previous
visit
i
have
retouched
this
this
out
that
some
expression
to
this
lip
and
more
energy
to
that
but
these
are
trifles
remarked
the
visitor
it
may
be
so
replied
the
sculptor
but
recollect
that
trifles
make
perfection
and
perfection
is
no
so
it
was
said
of
nicholas
poussin
the
painter
that
the
rule
of
his
conduct
was
that
whatever
was
worth
doing
at
all
was
worth
doing
well
and
when
asked
late
in
life
by
his
friend
vigneul
de
marville
by
what
means
he
had
gained
so
high
a
reputation
among
the
painters
of
italy
poussin
emphatically
answered
because
i
have
neglected
although
there
are
discoveries
which
are
said
to
have
been
made
by
accident
if
carefully
inquired
into
it
will
be
found
that
there
has
really
been
very
little
that
was
accidental
about
them
for
the
most
part
these
accidents
have
only
been
opportunities
carefully
improved
by
genius
the
fall
of
the
apple
at
newton
s
feet
has
often
been
quoted
in
proof
of
the
accidental
character
of
some
discoveries
but
newton
s
whole
mind
had
already
been
devoted
for
years
to
the
laborious
and
patient
investigation
of
the
subject
of
gravitation
and
the
circumstance
of
the
apple
falling
before
his
eyes
was
suddenly
apprehended
only
as
genius
could
apprehend
it
and
served
to
flash
upon
him
the
brilliant
discovery
then
opening
to
his
sight
in
like
manner
the
blown
from
a
common
tobacco
trifles
light
as
air
in
most
to
young
his
beautiful
theory
of
interferences
and
led
to
his
discovery
relating
to
the
diffraction
of
light
although
great
men
are
popularly
supposed
only
to
deal
with
great
things
men
such
as
newton
and
young
were
ready
to
detect
the
significance
of
the
most
familiar
and
simple
facts
their
greatness
consisting
mainly
in
their
wise
interpretation
of
them
the
difference
between
men
consists
in
a
great
measure
in
the
intelligence
of
their
observation
the
russian
proverb
says
of
the
man
he
goes
through
the
forest
and
sees
no
the
wise
man
s
eyes
are
in
his
head
says
solomon
but
the
fool
walketh
in
sir
said
johnson
on
one
occasion
to
a
fine
gentleman
just
returned
from
italy
some
men
will
learn
more
in
the
hampstead
stage
than
others
in
the
tour
of
it
is
the
mind
that
sees
as
well
as
the
eye
where
unthinking
gazers
observe
nothing
men
of
intelligent
vision
penetrate
into
the
very
fibre
of
the
phenomena
presented
to
them
attentively
noting
differences
making
comparisons
and
recognizing
their
underlying
idea
many
before
galileo
had
seen
a
suspended
weight
swing
before
their
eyes
with
a
measured
beat
but
he
was
the
first
to
detect
the
value
of
the
fact
one
of
the
vergers
in
the
cathedral
at
pisa
after
replenishing
with
oil
a
lamp
which
hung
from
the
roof
left
it
swinging
to
and
fro
and
galileo
then
a
youth
of
only
eighteen
noting
it
attentively
conceived
the
idea
of
applying
it
to
the
measurement
of
time
fifty
years
of
study
and
labour
however
elapsed
before
he
completed
the
invention
of
his
pendulum
importance
of
which
in
the
measurement
of
time
and
in
astronomical
calculations
can
scarcely
be
overrated
in
like
manner
galileo
having
casually
heard
that
one
lippershey
a
dutch
had
presented
to
count
maurice
of
nassau
an
instrument
by
means
of
which
distant
objects
appeared
nearer
to
the
beholder
addressed
himself
to
the
cause
of
such
a
phenomenon
which
led
to
the
invention
of
the
telescope
and
proved
the
beginning
of
the
modern
science
of
astronomy
discoveries
such
as
these
could
never
have
been
made
by
a
negligent
observer
or
by
a
mere
passive
listener
while
captain
afterwards
sir
samuel
brown
was
occupied
in
studying
the
construction
of
bridges
with
the
view
of
contriving
one
of
a
cheap
description
to
be
thrown
across
the
tweed
near
which
he
lived
he
was
walking
in
his
garden
one
dewy
autumn
morning
when
he
saw
a
tiny
spider
s
net
suspended
across
his
path
the
idea
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
a
bridge
of
iron
ropes
or
chains
might
be
constructed
in
like
manner
and
the
result
was
the
invention
of
his
suspension
bridge
so
james
watt
when
consulted
about
the
mode
of
carrying
water
by
pipes
under
the
clyde
along
the
unequal
bed
of
the
river
turned
his
attention
one
day
to
the
shell
of
a
lobster
presented
at
table
and
from
that
model
he
invented
an
iron
tube
which
when
laid
down
was
found
effectually
to
answer
the
purpose
sir
isambert
brunel
took
his
first
lessons
in
forming
the
thames
tunnel
from
the
tiny
shipworm
he
saw
how
the
little
creature
perforated
the
wood
with
its
head
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
till
the
archway
was
complete
and
then
daubed
over
the
roof
and
sides
with
a
kind
of
varnish
and
by
copying
this
work
exactly
on
a
large
scale
brunel
was
at
length
enabled
to
construct
his
shield
and
accomplish
his
great
engineering
work
it
is
the
intelligent
eye
of
the
careful
observer
which
gives
these
apparently
trivial
phenomena
their
value
so
trifling
a
matter
as
the
sight
of
seaweed
floating
past
his
ship
enabled
columbus
to
quell
the
mutiny
which
arose
amongst
his
sailors
at
not
discovering
land
and
to
assure
them
that
the
eagerly
sought
new
world
was
not
far
off
there
is
nothing
so
small
that
it
should
remain
forgotten
and
no
fact
however
trivial
but
may
prove
useful
in
some
way
or
other
if
carefully
interpreted
who
could
have
imagined
that
the
famous
chalk
cliffs
of
albion
had
been
built
up
by
tiny
only
by
the
help
of
the
the
same
order
of
creatures
that
have
gemmed
the
sea
with
islands
of
coral
and
who
that
contemplates
such
extraordinary
results
arising
from
infinitely
minute
operations
will
venture
to
question
the
power
of
little
things
it
is
the
close
observation
of
little
things
which
is
the
secret
of
success
in
business
in
art
in
science
and
in
every
pursuit
in
life
human
knowledge
is
but
an
accumulation
of
small
facts
made
by
successive
generations
of
men
the
little
bits
of
knowledge
and
experience
carefully
treasured
up
by
them
growing
at
length
into
a
mighty
pyramid
though
many
of
these
facts
and
observations
seemed
in
the
first
instance
to
have
but
slight
significance
they
are
all
found
to
have
their
eventual
uses
and
to
fit
into
their
proper
places
even
many
speculations
seemingly
remote
turn
out
to
be
the
basis
of
results
the
most
obviously
practical
in
the
case
of
the
conic
sections
discovered
by
apollonius
pergæus
twenty
centuries
elapsed
before
they
were
made
the
basis
of
science
which
enables
the
modern
navigator
to
steer
his
way
through
unknown
seas
and
traces
for
him
in
the
heavens
an
unerring
path
to
his
appointed
haven
and
had
not
mathematicians
toiled
for
so
long
and
to
uninstructed
observers
apparently
so
fruitlessly
over
the
abstract
relations
of
lines
and
surfaces
it
is
probable
that
but
few
of
our
mechanical
inventions
would
have
seen
the
light
when
franklin
made
his
discovery
of
the
identity
of
lightning
and
electricity
it
was
sneered
at
and
people
asked
of
what
use
is
it
to
which
his
reply
was
what
is
the
use
of
a
child
it
may
become
a
man
when
galvani
discovered
that
a
frog
s
leg
twitched
when
placed
in
contact
with
different
metals
it
could
scarcely
have
been
imagined
that
so
apparently
insignificant
a
fact
could
have
led
to
important
results
yet
therein
lay
the
germ
of
the
electric
telegraph
which
binds
the
intelligence
of
continents
together
and
probably
before
many
years
have
elapsed
will
put
a
girdle
round
the
so
too
little
bits
of
stone
and
fossil
dug
out
of
the
earth
intelligently
interpreted
have
issued
in
the
science
of
geology
and
the
practical
operations
of
mining
in
which
large
capitals
are
invested
and
vast
numbers
of
persons
profitably
employed
the
gigantic
machinery
employed
in
pumping
our
mines
working
our
mills
and
manufactures
and
driving
our
and
locomotives
in
like
manner
depends
for
its
supply
of
power
upon
so
slight
an
agency
as
little
drops
of
water
expanded
by
heat
familiar
agency
called
steam
which
we
see
issuing
from
that
common
spout
but
which
when
put
up
within
an
ingeniously
contrived
mechanism
displays
a
force
equal
to
that
of
millions
of
horses
and
contains
a
power
to
rebuke
the
waves
and
set
even
the
hurricane
at
defiance
the
same
power
at
work
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth
has
been
the
cause
of
those
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
which
have
played
so
mighty
a
part
in
the
history
of
the
globe
it
is
said
that
the
marquis
of
worcester
s
attention
was
first
accidentally
directed
to
the
subject
of
steam
power
by
the
tight
cover
of
a
vessel
containing
hot
water
having
been
blown
off
before
his
eyes
when
confined
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
he
published
the
result
of
his
observations
in
his
century
of
inventions
which
formed
a
sort
of
for
inquirers
into
the
powers
of
steam
for
a
time
until
savary
newcomen
and
others
applying
it
to
practical
purposes
brought
the
to
the
state
in
which
watt
found
it
when
called
upon
to
repair
a
model
of
newcomen
s
engine
which
belonged
to
the
university
of
glasgow
this
accidental
circumstance
was
an
opportunity
for
watt
which
he
was
not
slow
to
improve
and
it
was
the
labour
of
his
life
to
bring
the
to
perfection
this
art
of
seizing
opportunities
and
turning
even
accidents
to
account
bending
them
to
some
purpose
is
a
great
secret
of
success

in

at

he
became
possessed
with
a
desire
to
read

book
in

original
and
buying
a
cheap
copy
of
a
hebrew
grammar
he
set
to
work

sir
walter
scott
found
opportunities
for
in
every
pursuit
and
turned
even
accidents
to
account
thus
it
was
in
the
discharge
of
his
functions
as
a
writer
s
apprentice
that
he
first
visited
the
highlands
and
formed
those
friendships
among
the
surviving
heroes
of
which
served
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
large
class
of
his
works
later
in
life
when
employed
as
quartermaster
of
the
edinburgh
light
cavalry
he
was
accidentally
disabled
by
the
kick
of
a
horse
and
confined
for
some
time
to
his
house
but
scott
was
a
sworn
enemy
to
idleness
and
he
forthwith
set
his
mind
to
work
in
three
days
he
had
composed
the
first
canto
of
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
which
he
shortly
after
finished
first
great
original
work
the
attention
of
priestley
the
discoverer
of
so
many
gases
was
accidentally
drawn
to
the
subject
of
chemistry
through
his
living
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
brewery
when
visiting
the
place
one
day
he
noted
the
peculiar
appearances
attending
the
extinction
of
lighted
chips
in
the
gas
floating
over
the
fermented
liquor
he
was
forty
years
old
at
the
time
and
knew
nothing
of
chemistry
he
consulted
books
to
ascertain
the
cause
but
they
told
him
little
for
as
yet
nothing
was
known
on
the
subject
then
he
began
to
experiment
with
some
rude
apparatus
of
his
own
contrivance
the
curious
results
of
his
first
experiments
led
to
others
which
in
his
hands
shortly
became
the
science
of
pneumatic
chemistry

davy
when
an
apothecary

apprentice
performed
his
first
experiments
with
instruments
of
the
rudest
description
he
extemporised
the
greater
part
of
them
himself
out
of
the
motley
materials
which
chance
threw
in
his
way
pots
and
pans
of
the
kitchen
and
the
phials
and
vessels
of
his
master

it
happened
that
a
french
ship
was
wrecked
off

and
the
surgeon
escaped
bearing
with
him
his
case
of
instruments
amongst
which
was
an
glyster

this
article
he
presented
to
davy
with
whom
he
had
become
acquainted
the
apothecary
s
apprentice
received
it
with
great
exultation
and
forthwith
employed
it
as
a
part
of
a
pneumatic
apparatus

he
contrived
afterwards
using
it
to
perform

duties
of

professor

sir
humphry
davy
s
scientific
successor
made
his
first
experiments
in
electricity
by
means
of
an
old
bottle
white
he
was
still
a
working
bookbinder
and
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
faraday
was
first
attracted
to
the
study
of
chemistry
by
hearing
one
of
sir
humphry
davy
s
lectures
on
the
subject
at
the
royal
institution
a
gentleman
who
was
a
member
calling
one
day
at
the
shop
where
faraday
was
employed
in
binding
books
found
him
poring
over
the
article
electricity
in
an
encyclopædia
placed
in
his
hands
to
bind
the
gentleman
having
made
inquiries
found
that
the
young
bookbinder
was
curious
about
such
subjects
and
gave
him
an
order
of
admission
to
the
royal
institution
where
he
attended
a
course
of
four
lectures
delivered
by
sir
humphry
he
took
notes
of
them
which
he
showed
to
the
lecturer
who
acknowledged
their
scientific
accuracy
and
was
surprised
when
informed
of
the
humble
position
of
the
reporter
faraday
then
expressed
his
desire
to
devote
himself
to
the
prosecution
of
chemical
studies
from
which
sir
humphry
at
first
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
but
the
young
man
persisting
he
was
at
length
taken
into
the
royal
institution
as
an
assistant
and
eventually
the
mantle
of
the
brilliant
apothecary
s
boy
fell
upon
the
worthy
shoulders
of
the
equally
brilliant
bookbinder
s
apprentice
the
words
which
davy
entered
in
his
when
about
twenty
years
of
age
working
in
beddoes
laboratory
at
bristol
were
eminently
characteristic
of
him
i
have
neither
riches
nor
power
nor
birth
to
recommend
me
yet
if
i
live
i
trust
i
shall
not
be
of
less
service
to
mankind
and
my
friends
than
if
i
had
been
born
with
all
these
davy
possessed
the
capability
as
faraday
does
of
devoting
the
whole
power
of
his
mind
to
the
practical
and
experimental
investigation
of
a
subject
in
all
its
bearings
and
such
a
mind
will
rarely
fail
by
dint
of
mere
industry
and
patient
thinking
in
producing
results
of
the
highest
order
coleridge
said
of
davy
there
is
an
energy
and
elasticity
in
his
mind
which
enables
him
to
seize
on
and
analyze
all
questions
pushing
them
to
their
legitimate
consequences
every
subject
in
davy
s
mind
has
the
principle
of
vitality
living

spring
up
like

he

admired

the
great
cuvier
was
a
singularly
accurate
careful
and
industrious
observer
when
a
boy
he
was
attracted
to
the
subject
of
natural
history
by
the
sight
of
a
volume
of
buffon
which
accidentally
fell
in
his
way
he
at
once
proceeded
to
copy
the
drawings
and
to
colour
them
after
the
descriptions
given
in
the
text
while
still
at
school
one
of
his
teachers
made
him
a
present
of
linnæus
s
system
of
nature
and
for
more
than
ten
years
this
constituted
his
library
of
natural
history
at
eighteen
he
was
offered
the
situation
of
tutor
in
a
family
residing
near
fécamp
in
normandy
living
close
to
the
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
wonders
of
marine
life
strolling
along
the
sands
one
day
he
observed
a
stranded
cuttlefish
he
was
attracted
by
the
curious
object
took
it
home
to
dissect
and
thus
began
the
study
of
the
molluscæ
in
the
pursuit
of
which
he
achieved
so
distinguished
a
reputation
he
had
no
books
to
refer
to
excepting
only
the
great
book
of
nature
which
lay
open
before
him
the
study
of
the
novel
and
interesting
objects
which
it
daily
presented
to
his
eyes
made
a
much
deeper
impression
on
his
mind
than
any
written
or
engraved
descriptions
could
possibly
have
done
three
years
thus
passed
during
which
he
compared
the
living
species
of
marine
animals
with
the
fossil
remains
found
in
the
neighbourhood
dissected
the
specimens
of
marine
life
that
came
under
his
notice
and
by
careful
observation
prepared
the
way
for
a
complete
reform
in
the
classification
of
the
animal
kingdom
about
this
time
cuvier
became
known
to
the
learned
abbé
teissier
who
wrote
to
jussieu
and
other
friends
in
paris
on
the
subject
of
the
young
naturalist
s
inquiries
in
terms
of
such
high
commendation
that
cuvier
was
requested
to
send
some
of
his
papers
to
the
society
of
natural
history
and
he
was
shortly
after
appointed
at
the
jardin
des
plantes
in
the
letter
written
by
teissier
to
jussieu
introducing
the
young
naturalist
to
his
notice
he
said

that
it

who
gave

this
also
will
be
a
we
need
scarcely
add
that
the
prediction
of

was
more
than
fulfilled

by

mainly
by
reason
of
his

some
twenty
thousand

and
is
the
most
precious
treasure
of
the
kind
that
has
ever
been
accumulated
by
the

of
one
man
hunter
used
to
spend
every
morning
from
sunrise
until
eight
o

in
his

and
throughout
the

to

superintended
a

of

at

leisure
amidst
all
for
elaborate
experiments
on
the
animal
economy
and
the
composition
of
various
works
of
great
scientific
importance
to
find
time
for
this
gigantic
amount
of
work
he
allowed
himself
only
four
hours
of
sleep
at
night
and
an
hour
after
dinner
when
once
asked
what
method
he
had
adopted
to
insure
success
in

undertakings
he
replied
my
rule
is
deliberately
to
consider
before
i
commence
whether
the
thing
be
practicable
if
it
be
not
practicable
i
do
not
attempt
it
if
it
be
practicable
i
can
accomplish
it
if
i
give
sufficient
pains
to
it
and
having
begun
i
never
stop
till
the
thing
is
done
to
this
rule

owe
all
my
hunter
occupied
a
great
deal
of
his
time
in
collecting
definite
facts
respecting
matters
which
before
his
day
were
regarded
as
exceedingly
trivial
thus
it
was
supposed
by
many
of
his
contemporaries
that
he
was
only
wasting
his
time
and
thought
in
studying
so
carefully
as
he
did
the
growth
of
a
deer
s
horn
but
hunter
was
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
no
accurate
knowledge
of
scientific
facts
is
without
its
value
by
the
study
referred
to
he
learnt
how
arteries
accommodate
themselves
to
circumstances
and
enlarge
as
occasion
requires
and
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
emboldened
him
in
a
case
of
aneurism
in
a
branch
artery
to
tie
the
main
trunk
where
no
surgeon
before
him
had
dared
to
tie
it
and
the
life
of
his
patient
was
saved
like
many
original
men
he
worked
for
a
long
time
as
it
were
underground
digging
and
laying
foundations
he
was
a
solitary
and
genius
holding
on
his
course
without
the
solace
of
sympathy
or
approbation
but
few
of
his
contemporaries
perceived
the
ultimate
object
of
his
pursuits
but
like
all
true
workers
he
did
not
fail
in
securing
his
best
which
depends
less
upon
others
than
upon
one
s
approval
of
conscience
which
in
a
man
invariably
follows
the
honest
and
energetic
performance
of
duty
ambrose

the
great
french
surgeon
was
another
illustrious
instance
of
close
observation
patient
application
and
indefatigable
perseverance
he
was
the
son
of
a
barber
at
laval
in
maine
where
he
was
born
in
his
parents
were
too
poor
to
send
him
to
school

they
placed
him
as

curé
of

village
hoping

under
that
learned
man
he
might
pick
up
an
education
for
himself
but
the
curé
kept
him
so
busily
employed
in
grooming
his
mule
and
in
other
menial
offices
that
the
boy
found
no
time
for
learning
while
in
his
service
it
happened
that
the
celebrated
lithotomist
cotot
came
to
laval
to
operate
on
one
of
the
curé
s
ecclesiastical
brethren
paré
was
present
at
the
operation
and
was
so
much
interested
by
it
that
he
is
said
to
have
from
that
time
formed
the
determination
of
devoting
himself
to
the
art
of
surgery
leaving
the
curé
s
household
service
paré
apprenticed
himself
to
a
named
vialot
under
whom
he
learnt
to
let
blood
draw
teeth
and
perform
the
minor
operations
after
four
years
experience
of
this
kind
he
went
to
paris
to
study
at
the
school
of
anatomy
and
surgery
meanwhile
maintaining
himself
by
his
trade
of
a
barber
he
afterwards
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
appointment
as
assistant
at
the
hôtel
dieu
where
his
conduct
was
so
exemplary
and
his
progress
so
marked
that
the
chief
surgeon
goupil
entrusted
him
with
the
charge
of
the
patients
whom
he
could
not
himself
attend
to
after
the
usual
course
of
instruction
paré
was
admitted
a
master
and
shortly
after
was
appointed
to
a
charge
with
the
french
army
under
montmorenci
in
piedmont
paré
was
not
a
man
to
follow
in
the
ordinary
ruts
of
his
profession
but
brought
the
resources
of
an
ardent
and
original
mind
to
bear
upon
his
daily
work
diligently
thinking
out
for
himself
the
of
diseases
and
their
befitting
remedies
before
his
time
the
wounded
suffered
much
more
at
the
hands
of
their
surgeons
than
they
did
at
those
of
their
enemies
to
stop
bleeding
from
gunshot
wounds
the
barbarous
expedient
was
resorted
to
of
dressing
them
with
boiling
oil
hæmorrhage
was
also
stopped
by
searing
the
wounds
with
a
iron
and
when
amputation
was
necessary
it
was
performed
with
a
knife
at
first
paré
treated
wounds
according
to
the
approved
methods
but
fortunately
on
one
occasion
running
short
of
boiling
oil
he
substituted
a
mild
and
emollient
application
he
was
in
great
fear
all
night
lest
he
should
have
done
wrong
in
adopting
this
treatment
but
was
greatly
relieved
next
morning
on
finding
his
patients
comparatively
comfortable
while
those
whose
wounds
had
been
treated
in
the
usual
way
were
writhing
in
torment
such
was
the
casual
origin
of
one
of
paré
s
greatest
improvements
in
the
treatment
of
wounds
and
he
proceeded
to
adopt
the
emollient
treatment
in
all
future
cases
another
still
more
important
improvement
was
his
employment
of
the
ligature
in
tying
arteries
to
stop
hæmorrhage
instead
of
the
actual
cautery
paré
however
met
with
the
usual
fate
of
innovators
and
reformers
his
practice
was
denounced
by
his
surgical
brethren
as
dangerous
unprofessional
and
empirical
and
the
older
surgeons
banded
themselves
together
to
resist
its
adoption
they
reproached
him
for
his
want
of
education
more
especially
for
his
ignorance
of
latin
and
greek
and
they
assailed
him
with
quotations
from
ancient
writers
which
he
was
unable
either
to
verify
or
refute
but
the
best
answer
to
his
assailants
was
the
success
of
his
practice
the
wounded
soldiers
called
out
everywhere
for
paré
and
he
was
always
at
their
service
he
tended
them
carefully
and
affectionately
and
he
usually
took
leave
of
them
with
the
words
i
have
dressed
you
may
god
cure
after
three
years
active
service
as
paré
returned
to
paris
with
such
a
reputation
that
he
was
at
once
appointed
surgeon
in
ordinary
to
the
king
when
metz
was
besieged
by
the
spanish
army
under
charles
the
garrison
suffered
heavy
loss
and
the
number
of
wounded
was
very
great
the
surgeons
were
few
and
incompetent
and
probably
slew
more
by
their
bad
treatment
than
the
spaniards
did
by
the
sword
the
duke
of
guise
who
commanded
the
garrison
wrote
to
the
king
imploring
him
to
send
paré
to
his
help
the
courageous
surgeon
at
once
set
out
and
after
braving
many
dangers
to
use
his
own
words
d
estre
pendu
estranglé
ou
mis
en
pièces
he
succeeded
in
passing
the
enemy
s
lines
and
entered
metz
in
safety
the
duke
the
generals
and
the
captains
gave
him
an
affectionate
welcome
while
the
soldiers
when
they
heard
of
his
arrival
cried
we
no
longer
fear
dying
of
our
wounds
our
friend
is
among
in
the
following
year
paré
was
in
like
manner
with
the
besieged
in
the
town
of
hesdin
which
shortly
fell
before
the
duke
of
savoy
and
he
was
taken
prisoner
but
having
succeeded
in
curing
one
of
the
enemy
s
chief
officers
of
a
serious
wound
he
was
discharged
without
ransom
and
returned
in
safety
to
paris
the
rest
of
his
life
was
occupied
in
study
in
in
piety
and
in
good
deeds
urged
by
some
of
the
most
learned
among
his
contemporaries
he
placed
on
record
the
results
of
his
surgical
experience
in
books
which
were
published
by
him
at
different
times
his
writings
are
valuable
and
remarkable
chiefly
on
account
of
the
great
number
of
facts
and
cases
contained
in
them
and
the
care
with
which
he
avoids
giving
any
directions
resting
merely
upon
theory
unsupported
by
observation
paré
continued
though
a
protestant
to
hold
the
office
of
surgeon
in
ordinary
to
the
king
and
during
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
he
owed
his
life
to
the
personal
friendship
of
charles
whom
he
had
on
one
occasion
saved
from
the
dangerous
effects
of
a
wound
inflicted
by
a
clumsy
surgeon
in
performing
the
operation
of
venesection
brantôme
in
his
mémoires
thus
speaks
of
the
king
s
rescue
of
paré
on
the
night
of
saint
he
sent
to
fetch
him
and
to
remain
during
the
night
in
his
chamber
and
commanding
him
not
to
stir
and
saying
that
it
was
not
reasonable
that
a
man
who
had
preserved
the
lives
of
so
many
people
should
himself
be
thus
paré
escaped
the
horrors
of
that
fearful
night
which
he
survived
for
many
years
and
was
permitted
to
die
in
peace
full
of
age
and
honours
harvey
was
as
indefatigable
a
labourer
as
any
we
have
named
he
spent
not
less
than
eight
long
years
of
investigation
and
research
before
he
published
his
views
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
he
repeated
and
verified
his
experiments
again
and
again
probably
anticipating
the
opposition
he
would
have
to
encounter
from
the
profession
on
making
known
his
discovery
the
tract
in
which
he
at
length
announced
his
views
was
a
most
modest
one
simple
perspicuous
and
conclusive
it
was
nevertheless
received
with
ridicule
as
the
utterance
of
a
impostor
for
some
time
he
did
not
make
a
single
convert
and
gained
nothing
but
contumely
and
abuse
he
had
called
in
question
the
revered
authority
of
the
ancients
and
it
was
even
averred
that
his
views
were
calculated
to
subvert
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
and
undermine
the
very
foundations
of
morality
and
religion
his
little
practice
fell
away
and
he
was
left
almost
without
a
friend
this
lasted
for
some
years
until
the
great
truth
held
fast
by
harvey
amidst
all
his
adversity
and
which
had
dropped
into
many
thoughtful
minds
gradually
ripened
by
further
observation
and
after
a
period
of
about
years
it
became
generally
recognised
as
an
established
scientific
truth
the
difficulties
encountered
by
jenner
in
promulgating
and
establishing
his
discovery
of
vaccination
as
a
preventive
of
were
even
greater
than
those
of
harvey
many
before
him
had
witnessed
the
and
had
heard
of
the
report
current
among
the
milkmaids
in
gloucestershire
that
whoever
had
taken
that
disease
was
secure
against
it
was
a
trifling
vulgar
rumour
supposed
to
have
no
significance
whatever
and
no
one
had
thought
it
worthy
of
investigation
until
it
was
accidentally
brought
under
the
notice
of
jenner
he
was
a
youth
pursuing
his
studies
at
sodbury
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
casual
observation
made
by
a
country
girl
who
came
to
his
master
s
shop
for
advice
the
was
mentioned
when
the
girl
said
i
can
t
take
that
disease
for
i
have
had
the
observation
immediately
riveted
jenner
s
attention
and
he
forthwith
set
about
inquiring
and
making
observations
on
the
subject
his
professional
friends
to
whom
he
mentioned
his
views
as
to
the
prophylactic
virtues
of
laughed
at
him
and
even
threatened
to
expel
him
from
their
society
if
he
persisted
in
harassing
them
with
the
subject
in
london
he
was
so
fortunate
as
to
study
under
john
hunter
to
whom
he
communicated
his
views
the
advice
of
the
great
anatomist
was
thoroughly
characteristic
don
t
think
but
be
patient
be
jenner
s
courage
was
supported
by
the
advice
which
conveyed
to
him
the
true
art
of
philosophical
investigation
he
went
back
to
the
country
to
practise
his
profession
and
make
observations
and
experiments
which
he
continued
to
pursue
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
his
faith
in
his
discovery
was
so
implicit
that
he
vaccinated
his
own
son
on
three
several
occasions
at
length
he
published
his
views
in
a
quarto
of
about
seventy
pages
in
which
he
gave
the
details
of
cases
of
successful
vaccination
of
individuals
to
whom
it
was
found
afterwards
impossible
to
communicate
the
either
by
contagion
or
inoculation
it
was
in
that
this
treatise
was
published
though
he
had
been
working
out
his
ideas
since
the
year
when
they
had
begun
to
assume
a
definite
form
how
was
the
discovery
received
first
with
indifference
then
with
active
hostility
jenner
proceeded
to
london
to
exhibit
to
the
profession
the
process
of
vaccination
and
its
results
but
not
a
single
medical
man
could
be
induced
to
make
trial
of
it
and
after
fruitlessly
waiting
for
nearly
three
months
he
returned
to
his
native
village
he
was
even
caricatured
and
abused
for
his
attempt
to
bestialize
his
species
by
the
introduction
into
their
systems
of
diseased
matter
from
the
cow
s
udder
vaccination
was
denounced
from
the
pulpit
as
it
was
averred
that
vaccinated
children
became
that
abscesses
broke
out
to
indicate
sprouting
horns
and
that
the
countenance
was
gradually
transmuted
into
the
visage
of
a
cow
the
voice
into
the
bellowing
of
vaccination
however
was
a
truth
and
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
opposition
belief
in
it
spread
slowly
in
one
village
where
a
gentleman
tried
to
introduce
the
practice
the
first
persons
who
permitted
themselves
to
be
vaccinated
were
absolutely
pelted
and
driven
into
their
houses
if
they
appeared
out
of
doors
two
ladies
of
ducie
and
the
countess
of
their
honour
be
it
the
courage
to
vaccinate
their
children
and
the
prejudices
of
the
day
were
at
once
broken
through
the
medical
profession
gradually
came
round
and
there
were
several
who
even
sought
to
rob
jenner
of
the
merit
of
the
discovery
when
its
importance
came
to
be
recognised
jenner
s
cause
at
last
triumphed
and
he
was
publicly
honoured
and
rewarded
in
his
prosperity
he
was
as
modest
as
he
had
been
in
his
obscurity
he
was
invited
to
settle
in
london
and
told
that
he
might
command
a
practice
of
a
year
but
his
answer
was
no
in
the
morning
of
my
days
i
have
sought
the
sequestered
and
lowly
paths
of
valley
and
not
the
mountain
now
in
the
evening
of
my
days
it
is
not
meet
for
me
to
hold
myself
up
as
an
object
for
fortune
and
for
during
jenner
s
own
the
practice
of
vaccination
became
adopted
all
over
the
civilized
world
and
when
he
died
his
title
as
a
benefactor
of
his
kind
was
recognised
far
and
wide
cuvier
has
said
if
vaccine
were
the
only
discovery
of
the
epoch
it
would
serve
to
render
it
illustrious
for
ever
yet
it
knocked
twenty
times
in
vain
at
the
doors
of
the
not
less
patient
resolute
and
persevering
was
sir
charles
bell
in
the
prosecution
of
his
discoveries
relating
to
the
nervous
system
previous
to
his
time
the
most
confused
notions
prevailed
as
to
the
functions
of
the
nerves
and
this
branch
of
study
was
little
more
advanced
than
it
had
been
in
the
times
of
democritus
and
anaxagoras
three
thousand
years
before
sir
charles
bell
in
the
valuable
series
of
papers
the
publication
of
which
was
commenced
in
took
an
entirely
original
view
of
the
subject
based
upon
a
long
series
of
careful
accurate
and
experiments
elaborately
tracing
the
development
of
the
nervous
system
up
from
the
lowest
order
of
animated
being
to
lord
of
the
animal
kingdom
displayed
it
to
use
his
own
words
as
plainly
as
if
it
were
written
in
our
his
discovery
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
spinal
nerves
are
double
in
their
function
and
arise
by
double
roots
from
the
spinal
marrow
being
conveyed
by
that
part
of
the
nerves
springing
from
the
one
root
and
sensation
by
the
other
the
subject
occupied
the
mind
of
sir
charles
bell
for
a
period
of
forty
years
when
in
he
laid
his
last
paper
before
the
royal
society
as
in
the
cases
of
harvey
and
jenner
when
he
had
lived
down
the
ridicule
and
opposition
with
which
his
views
were
first
received
and
their
truth
came
to
be
recognised
numerous
claims
for
priority
in
making
the
discovery
were
set
up
at
home
and
abroad
like
them
too
he
lost
practice
by
the
publication
of
his
papers
and
he
left
it
on
record
that
after
every
step
in
his
discovery
he
was
obliged
to
work
harder
than
ever
to
preserve
his
reputation
as
a
practitioner
the
great
merits
of
sir
charles
bell
were
however
at
length
fully
recognised
and
cuvier
himself
when
on
his
finding
his
face
distorted
and
drawn
to
one
side
pointed
out
the
symptom
to
his
attendants
as
a
proof
of
the
correctness
of
sir
charles
bell
s
theory
an
equally
devoted
pursuer
of
the
same
branch
of
science
was
the
late
marshall
hall
whose
name
posterity
will
rank
with
those
of
harvey
hunter
jenner
and
bell
during
the
whole
course
of
his
long
and
useful
life
he
was
a
most
careful
and
minute
observer
and
no
fact
however
apparently
insignificant
escaped
his
attention
his
important
discovery
of
the
diastaltic
nervous
system
by
which
his
name
will
long
be
known
amongst
scientific
men
originated
in
an
exceedingly
simple
circumstance
when
investigating
the
pneumonic
circulation
in
the
triton
the
decapitated
object
lay
upon
the
table
and
on
separating
the
tail
and
accidentally
pricking
the
external
integument
he
observed
that
it
moved
with
energy
and
became
contorted
into
various
forms
he
had
not
touched
a
muscle
or
a
muscular
nerve
what
then
was
the
nature
of
these
movements
the
same
phenomena
had
probably
been
often
observed
before
but
hall
was
the
first
to
apply
himself
perseveringly
to
the
investigation
of
their
causes
and
he
exclaimed
on
the
occasion
i
will
never
rest
satisfied
until
i
have
found
all
this
out
and
made
it
his
attention
to
the
subject
was
almost
incessant
and
it
is
estimated
that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
devoted
not
less
than
hours
to
its
experimental
and
chemical
investigation
he
was
at
the
same
time
carrying
on
an
extensive
private
practice
and
officiating
as
lecturer
at
thomas
s
hospital
and
other
medical
schools
it
will
scarcely
be
credited
that
the
paper
in
which
he
embodied
his
discovery
was
rejected
by
the
royal
society
and
was
only
accepted
after
the
lapse
of
seventeen
years
when
the
truth
of
his
views
had
become
acknowledged
by
scientific
men
both
at
home
and
abroad
the
life
of
sir
william
herschel
affords
another
remarkable
illustration
of
the
force
of
perseverance
in
another
branch
of
science
his
father
was
a
poor
german
musician
who
brought
up
his
four
sons
to
the
same
calling
william
came
over
to
england
to
seek
his
fortune
and
he
joined
the
band
of
the
durham
militia
in
which
he
played
the
oboe
the
regiment
was
lying
at
doncaster
where
miller
first
became
acquainted
with
herschel
having
heard
him
perform
a
solo
on
the
violin
in
a
surprising
manner
the
doctor
entered
into
conversation
with
the
youth
and
was
so
pleased
with
him
that
he
urged
him
to
leave
the
militia
and
take
up
his
residence
at
his
house
for
a
time
herschel
did
so
and
while
at
doncaster
was
principally
occupied
in
at
concerts
availing
himself
of
the
advantages
of
miller
s
library
to
study
at
his
leisure
hours
a
new
organ
having
been
built
for
the
parish
church
of
halifax
an
organist
was
advertised
for
on
which
herschel
applied
for
the
office
and
was
selected
leading
the
wandering
life
of
an
artist
he
was
next
attracted
to
bath
where
he
played
in
the
band
and
also
officiated
as
organist
in
the
octagon
chapel
some
recent
discoveries
in
astronomy
having
arrested
his
mind
and
awakened
in
him
a
powerful
spirit
of
curiosity
he
sought
and
obtained
from
a
friend
the
loan
of
a
gregorian
telescope
so
fascinated
was
the
poor
musician
by
the
science
that
he
even
thought
of
purchasing
a
telescope
but
the
price
asked
by
the
london
optician
was
so
alarming
that
he
determined
to
make
one
those
who
know
what
a
reflecting
telescope
is
and
the
skill
which
is
required
to
prepare
the
concave
metallic
speculum
which
forms
the
most
important
part
of
the
apparatus
will
be
able
to
form
some
idea
of
the
difficulty
of
this
undertaking
nevertheless
herschel
succeeded
after
long
and
painful
labour
in
completing
a
reflector
with
which
he
had
the
gratification
of
observing
the
ring
and
satellites
of
saturn
not
satisfied
with
his
triumph
he
proceeded
to
make
other
instruments
in
succession
of
seven
ten
and
even
twenty
feet
in
constructing
the
reflector
he
finished
no
fewer
than
two
hundred
specula
before
he
produced
one
that
would
bear
any
power
that
was
applied
to
it
striking
instance
of
the
persevering
laboriousness
of
the
man
while
gauging
the
heavens
with
his
instruments
he
continued
patiently
to
earn
his
bread
by
piping
to
the
fashionable
frequenters
of
the
so
eager
was
he
in
his
astronomical
observations
that
he
would
steal
away
from
the
room
during
an
interval
of
the
performance
give
a
little
turn
at
his
telescope
and
contentedly
return
to
his
oboe
thus
working
away
herschel
discovered
the
georgium
sidus
the
orbit
and
rate
of
motion
of
which
he
carefully
calculated
and
sent
the
result
to
the
royal
society
when
the
humble
oboe
player
found
himself
at
once
elevated
from
obscurity
to
fame
he
was
shortly
after
appointed
astronomer
royal
and
by
the
kindness
of
george
iii
was
placed
in
a
position
of
honourable
competency
for
life
he
bore
his
honours
with
the
same
meekness
and
humility
which
had
distinguished
him
in
the
days
of
his
obscurity
so
gentle
and
patient
and
withal
so
distinguished
and
successful
a
follower
of
science
under
difficulties
perhaps
can
not
be
found
in
the
entire
history
of
biography
the
career
of
william
smith
the
father
of
english
geology
though
perhaps
less
known
is
not
less
interesting
and
instructive
as
an
example
of
patient
and
laborious
effort
and
the
diligent
cultivation
of
opportunities
he
was
born
in
the
son
of
a
yeoman
farmer
at
churchill
in
oxfordshire
his
father
dying
when
he
was
but
a
child
he
received
a
very
sparing
education
at
the
village
school
and
even
that
was
to
a
considerable
extent
interfered
with
by
his
wandering
and
somewhat
idle
habits
as
a
boy
his
mother
having
married
a
second
time
he
was
taken
in
charge
by
an
uncle
also
a
farmer
by
whom
he
was
brought
up
though
the
uncle
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
the
boy
s
love
of
wandering
about
collecting
poundstones
pundips
and
other
stony
curiosities
which
lay
scattered
about
the
adjoining
land
he
yet
enabled
him
to
purchase
a
few
of
the
necessary
books
wherewith
to
instruct
himself
in
the
rudiments
of
geometry
and
surveying
for
the
boy
was
already
destined
for
the
business
of
a
one
of
his
marked
characteristics
even
as
a
youth
was
the
accuracy
and
keenness
of
his
observation
and
what
he
once
clearly
saw
he
never
forgot
he
began
to
draw
attempted
to
colour
and
practised
the
arts
of
mensuration
and
surveying
all
without
regular
instruction
and
by
his
efforts
in
he
shortly
became
so
proficient
that
he
was
taken
on
as
assistant
to
a
local
surveyor
of
ability
in
the
neighbourhood
in
carrying
on
his
business
he
was
constantly
under
the
necessity
of
traversing
oxfordshire
and
the
adjoining
counties
one
of
the
first
things
he
seriously
pondered
over
was
the
position
of
the
various
soils
and
strata
that
came
under
his
notice
on
the
lands
which
he
surveyed
or
travelled
over
more
especially
the
position
of
the
red
earth
in
regard
to
the
lias
and
superincumbent
rocks
the
surveys
of
numerous
collieries
which
he
was
called
upon
to
make
gave
him
further
experience
and
already
when
only
years
of
age
he
contemplated
making
a
model
of
the
strata
of
the
earth
while
engaged
in
levelling
for
a
proposed
canal
in
gloucestershire
the
idea
of
a
general
law
occurred
to
him
relating
to
the
strata
of
that
district
he
conceived
that
the
strata
lying
above
the
coal
were
not
laid
horizontally
but
inclined
and
in
one
direction
towards
the
east
resembling
on
a
large
scale
the
ordinary
appearance
of
superposed
slices
of
bread
and
the
correctness
of
this
theory
he
shortly
after
confirmed
by
observations
of
the
strata
in
two
parallel
valleys
the
red
ground
lias
and
freestone
or
oolite
being
found
to
come
down
in
an
eastern
direction
and
to
sink
below
the
level
yielding
place
to
the
next
in
succession
he
was
shortly
enabled
to
verify
the
truth
of
his
views
on
a
larger
scale
having
been
appointed
to
examine
personally
into
the
management
of
canals
in
england
and
wales
during
his
journeys
which
extended
from
bath
to
returning
by
shropshire
and
wales
his
keen
eyes
were
never
idle
for
a
moment
he
rapidly
noted
the
aspect
and
structure
of
the
country
through
which
he
passed
with
his
companions
treasuring
up
his
observations
for
future
use
his
geologic
vision
was
so
acute
that
though
the
road
along
which
he
passed
from
york
to
newcastle
in
the
post
chaise
was
from
five
to
fifteen
miles
distant
from
the
hills
of
chalk
and
oolite
on
the
east
he
was
satisfied
as
to
their
nature
by
their
contours
and
relative
position
and
their
ranges
on
the
surface
in
relation
to
the
lias
and
red
ground
occasionally
seen
on
the
road
the
general
results
of
his
observation
seem
to
have
been
these
he
noted
that
the
rocky
masses
of
country
in
the
western
parts
of
england
generally
inclined
to
the
east
and
that
the
red
sandstones
and
marls
above
the
coal
measures
passed
beneath
the
lias
clay
and
limestone
that
these
again
passed
beneath
the
sands
yellow
limestones
and
clays
forming
the
of
the
cotswold
hills
while
these
in
turn
passed
beneath
the
great
chalk
deposits
occupying
the
eastern
parts
of
england
he
further
observed
that
each
layer
of
clay
sand
and
limestone
held
its
own
peculiar
classes
of
fossils
and
pondering
much
on
these
things
he
at
length
came
to
the
then
conclusion
that
each
distinct
deposit
of
marine
animals
in
these
several
strata
indicated
a
distinct
and
that
each
layer
of
clay
sand
chalk
and
stone
marked
a
distinct
epoch
of
time
in
the
history
of
the
earth
this
idea
took
firm
possession
of
his
mind
and
he
could
talk
and
think
of
nothing
else
at
canal
boards
at
at
county
meetings
and
at
agricultural
associations
strata
smith
as
he
came
to
be
called
was
always
running
over
with
the
subject
that
possessed
him
he
had
indeed
made
a
great
discovery
though
he
was
as
yet
a
man
utterly
unknown
in
the
scientific
world
he
proceeded
to
project
a
map
of
the
stratification
of
england
but
was
for
some
time
deterred
from
proceeding
with
it
being
fully
occupied
in
carrying
out
the
works
of
the
somersetshire
coal
canal
which
engaged
him
for
a
period
of
about
six
years
he
continued
nevertheless
to
be
unremitting
in
his
observation
of
facts
and
he
became
so
expert
in
apprehending
the
internal
structure
of
a
district
and
detecting
the
lie
of
the
strata
from
its
external
configuration
that
he
was
often
consulted
respecting
the
drainage
of
extensive
tracts
of
land
in
which
guided
by
his
geological
knowledge
he
proved
remarkably
successful
and
acquired
an
extensive
reputation
one
day
when
looking
over
the
cabinet
collection
of
fossils
belonging
to
the
rev
samuel
richardson
at
bath
smith
astonished
his
friend
by
suddenly
disarranging
his
classification
and
the
fossils
in
their
stratigraphical
order
these
came
from
the
blue
lias
these
from
the
sand
and
freestone
these
from
the
fuller
s
earth
and
these
from
the
bath
building
a
new
light
flashed
upon
richardson
s
mind
and
he
shortly
became
a
convert
to
and
believer
in
william
smith
s
doctrine
the
geologists
of
the
day
were
not
however
so
easily
convinced
and
it
was
scarcely
to
be
tolerated
that
an
unknown
should
pretend
to
teach
them
the
science
of
geology
but
william
smith
had
an
eye
and
mind
to
penetrate
deep
beneath
the
skin
of
the
earth
he
saw
its
very
fibre
and
skeleton
and
as
it
were
divined
its
organization
his
knowledge
of
the
strata
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bath
was
so
accurate
that
one
evening
when
dining
at
the
house
of
the
rev
joseph
townsend
he
dictated
to
richardson
the
different
strata
according
to
their
order
of
succession
in
descending
order
in
number
commencing
with
the
chalk
and
descending
in
continuous
series
down
to
the
coal
below
which
the
strata
were
not
then
sufficiently
determined
to
this
was
added
a
list
of
the
more
remarkable
fossils
which
had
been
gathered
in
the
several
layers
of
rock
this
was
printed
and
extensively
circulated
in
he
next
determined
to
trace
out
the
strata
through
districts
as
remote
from
bath
as
his
means
would
enable
him
to
reach
for
years
he
journeyed
to
and
fro
sometimes
on
foot
sometimes
on
horseback
riding
on
the
tops
of
stage
coaches
often
making
up
by
the
time
he
had
lost
by
day
so
as
not
to
fail
in
his
ordinary
business
engagements
when
he
was
professionally
called
away
to
any
distance
from
for
instance
when
travelling
from
bath
to
holkham
in
norfolk
to
direct
the
irrigation
and
drainage
of
coke
s
land
in
that
rode
on
horseback
making
frequent
detours
from
the
road
to
note
the
geological
features
of
the
country
which
he
traversed
for
several
years
he
was
thus
engaged
in
his
journeys
to
distant
quarters
in
england
and
ireland
to
the
extent
of
upwards
of
ten
thousand
miles
yearly
and
it
was
amidst
this
incessant
and
laborious
travelling
that
he
contrived
to
commit
to
paper
his
generalizations
on
what
he
rightly
regarded
as
a
new
science
no
observation
howsoever
trivial
it
might
appear
was
neglected
and
no
opportunity
of
collecting
fresh
facts
was
overlooked
whenever
he
could
he
possessed
himself
of
records
of
borings
natural
and
artificial
sections
drew
them
to
a
constant
scale
of
eight
yards
to
the
inch
and
coloured
them
up
of
his
keenness
of
observation
take
the
following
illustration
when
making
one
of
his
geological
excursions
about
the
country
near
woburn
as
he
was
drawing
near
to
the
foot
of
the
dunstable
chalk
hills
he
observed
to
his
companion
if
there
be
any
broken
ground
about
the
foot
of
these
hills
we
may
find
s
and
they
had
not
proceeded
far
before
they
picked
up
six
from
the
white
bank
of
a
new
as
he
afterwards
said
of
himself
the
habit
of
observation
crept
on
me
gained
a
settlement
in
my
mind
became
a
constant
associate
of
my
life
and
started
up
in
activity
at
the
first
thought
of
a
journey
so
that
i
generally
went
off
well
prepared
with
maps
and
sometimes
with
contemplations
on
its
objects
or
on
those
on
the
road
reduced
to
writing
before
it
commenced
my
mind
was
therefore
like
the
canvas
of
a
painter
well
prepared
for
the
first
and
best
notwithstanding
his
courageous
and
indefatigable
industry
many
circumstances
contributed
to
prevent
the
promised
publication
of
william
smith
s
map
of
the
strata
of
england
and
wales
and
it
was
not
until
that
he
was
enabled
by
the
assistance
of
some
friends
to
give
to
the
world
the
fruits
of
his
twenty
years
incessant
labour
to
prosecute
his
inquiries
and
collect
the
extensive
series
of
facts
and
observations
requisite
for
his
purpose
he
had
to
expend
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
professional
labours
during
that
period
and
he
even
sold
off
his
small
property
to
provide
the
means
of
visiting
remoter
parts
of
the
island
meanwhile
he
had
entered
on
a
quarrying
speculation
near
bath
which
proved
unsuccessful
and
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
selling
his
geological
collection
which
was
purchased
by
the
british
museum
his
furniture
and
library
reserving
only
his
papers
maps
and
sections
which
were
useless
save
to
himself
he
bore
his
losses
and
misfortunes
with
exemplary
fortitude
and
amidst
all
he
went
on
working
with
cheerful
courage
and
untiring
patience
he
died
at
northampton
in
august
while
on
his
way
to
attend
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
birmingham
it
is
difficult
to
speak
in
terms
of
too
high
praise
of
the
first
geological
map
of
england
which
we
owe
to
the
industry
of
this
courageous
man
of
science
an
accomplished
writer
says
of
it
it
was
a
work
so
masterly
in
conception
and
so
correct
in
general
outline
that
in
principle
it
served
as
a
basis
not
only
for
the
production
of
later
maps
of
the
british
islands
but
for
geological
maps
of
all
other
parts
of
the
world
wherever
they
have
been
undertaken
in
the
apartments
of
the
geological
society
smith
s
map
may
yet
be
great
historical
document
old
and
worn
calling
for
renewal
of
its
faded
tints
let
any
one
conversant
with
the
subject
compare
it
with
later
works
on
a
similar
scale
and
he
will
find
that
in
all
essential
features
it
will
not
suffer
by
the
intricate
anatomy
of
the
silurian
rocks
of
wales
and
the
north
of
england
by
murchison
and
sedgwick
being
the
chief
additions
made
to
his
great
the
genius
of
the
oxfordshire
surveyor
did
not
fail
to
be
duly
recognised
and
honoured
by
men
of
science
during
his
lifetime
in
the
geological
society
of
london
awarded
to
him
the
wollaston
medal
in
consideration
of
his
being
a
great
original
discoverer
in
english
geology
and
especially
for
his
being
the
first
in
this
country
to
discover
and
to
teach
the
identification
of
strata
and
to
determine
their
succession
by
means
of
their
imbedded
william
smith
in
his
simple
earnest
way
gained
for
himself
a
name
as
lasting
as
the
science
he
loved
so
well
to
use
the
words
of
the
writer
above
quoted
till
the
manner
as
well
as
the
fact
of
the
first
appearance
of
successive
forms
of
life
shall
be
solved
it
is
not
easy
to
surmise
how
any
discovery
can
be
made
in
geology
equal
in
value
to
that
which
we
owe
to
the
genius
of
william
hugh
miller
was
a
man
of
like
observant
faculties
who
studied
literature
as
well
as
science
with
zeal
and
success
the
book
in
which
he
has
told
the
story
of
his
life
my
schools
and
schoolmasters
is
extremely
interesting
and
calculated
to
be
eminently
useful
it
is
the
history
of
the
formation
of
a
truly
noble
character
in
the
humblest
condition
of
life
and
inculcates
most
powerfully
the
lessons
of
and
while
hugh
was
but
a
child
his
father
who
was
a
sailor
was
drowned
at
sea
and
he
was
brought
up
by
his
widowed
mother
he
had
a
school
training
after
a
sort
but
his
best
teachers
were
the
boys
with
whom
he
played
the
men
amongst
whom
he
worked
the
friends
and
relatives
with
whom
he
lived
he
read
much
and
miscellaneously
and
picked
up
odd
sorts
of
knowledge
from
many
quarters
workmen
carpenters
fishermen
and
sailors
and
above
all
from
the
old
boulders
strewed
along
the
shores
of
the
cromarty
frith
with
a
big
hammer
which
had
belonged
to
his
an
old
buccaneer
the
boy
went
about
chipping
the
stones
and
accumulating
specimens
of
mica
porphyry
garnet
and
such
like
sometimes
he
had
a
day
in
the
woods
and
there
too
the
boy
s
attention
was
excited
by
the
peculiar
geological
curiosities
which
came
in
his
way
while
searching
among
the
rocks
on
the
beach
he
was
sometimes
asked
in
irony
by
the
farm
servants
who
came
to
load
their
carts
with
whether
he
was
gettin
siller
in
the
stanes
but
was
so
unlucky
as
never
to
be
able
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
when
of
a
suitable
age
he
was
apprenticed
to
the
trade
of
his
of
a
working
stonemason
and
he
began
his
labouring
career
in
a
quarry
looking
out
upon
the
cromarty
frith
this
quarry
proved
one
of
his
best
schools
the
remarkable
geological
formations
which
it
displayed
awakened
his
curiosity
the
bar
of
stone
beneath
and
the
bar
of
clay
above
were
noted
by
the
young
quarryman
who
even
in
such
unpromising
subjects
found
matter
for
observation
and
reflection
where
other
men
saw
nothing
he
detected
analogies
differences
and
peculiarities
which
set
him
he
simply
kept
his
eyes
and
his
mind
open
was
sober
diligent
and
persevering
and
this
was
the
secret
of
his
intellectual
growth
his
curiosity
was
excited
and
kept
alive
by
the
curious
organic
remains
principally
of
old
and
extinct
species
of
fishes
ferns
and
ammonites
which
were
revealed
along
the
coast
by
the
washings
of
the
waves
or
were
exposed
by
the
stroke
of
his
mason
s
hammer
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
subject
but
went
on
accumulating
observations
and
comparing
formations
until
at
length
many
years
afterwards
when
no
longer
a
working
mason
he
gave
to
the
world
his
highly
interesting
work
on
the
old
red
sandstone
which
at
once
established
his
reputation
as
a
scientific
geologist
but
this
work
was
the
fruit
of
long
years
of
patient
observation
and
research
as
he
modestly
states
in
his
autobiography
the
only
merit
to
which
i
lay
claim
in
the
case
is
that
of
patient
merit
in
which
whoever
wills
may
rival
or
surpass
me
and
this
humble
faculty
of
patience
when
rightly
developed
may
lead
to
more
extraordinary
developments
of
idea
than
even
genius
the
late
john
brown
the
eminent
english
geologist
was
like
miller
a
stonemason
in
his
early
life
serving
an
apprenticeship
to
the
trade
at
colchester
and
afterwards
working
as
a
journeyman
mason
at
norwich
he
began
business
as
a
builder
on
his
own
account
at
colchester
where
by
frugality
and
industry
he
secured
a
competency
it
was
while
working
at
his
trade
that
his
attention
was
first
drawn
to
the
study
of
fossils
and
shells
and
he
proceeded
to
make
a
collection
of
them
which
afterwards
grew
into
one
of
the
finest
in
england
his
researches
along
the
coasts
of
essex
kent
and
sussex
brought
to
light
some
magnificent
remains
of
the
elephant
and
rhinoceros
the
most
valuable
of
which
were
presented
by
him
to
the
british
museum
during
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
he
devoted
considerable
attention
to
the
study
of
the
foraminifera
in
chalk
respecting
which
he
made
several
interesting
discoveries
his
life
was
useful
happy
and
honoured
and
he
died
at
stanway
in
essex
in
november
at
the
ripe
age
of
eighty
years
not
long
ago
sir
roderick
murchison
discovered
at
thurso
in
the
far
north
of
scotland
a
profound
geologist
in
the
person
of
a
baker
there
named
robert
dick
when
sir
roderick
called
upon
him
at
the
bakehouse
in
which
he
baked
and
earned
his
bread
robert
dick
delineated
to
him
by
means
of
flour
upon
the
board
the
geographical
features
and
geological
phenomena
of
his
native
county
pointing
out
the
imperfections
in
the
existing
maps
which
he
had
ascertained
by
travelling
over
the
country
in
his
leisure
hours
on
further
inquiry
sir
roderick
ascertained
that
the
humble
individual
before
him
was
not
only
a
capital
baker
and
geologist
but
a
botanist
i
found
said
the
president
of
the
geographical
society
to
my
great
humiliation
that
the
baker
knew
infinitely
more
of
botanical
science
ay
ten
times
more
than
i
did
and
that
there
were
only
some
twenty
or
thirty
specimens
of
flowers
which
he
had
not
collected
some
he
had
obtained
as
presents
some
he
had
purchased
but
the
greater
portion
had
been
accumulated
by
his
industry
in
his
native
county
of
caithness
and
the
specimens
were
all
arranged
in
the
most
beautiful
order
with
their
scientific
names
sir
roderick
murchison
himself
is
an
illustrious
follower
of
these
and
kindred
branches
of
science
a
writer
in
the
quarterly
review
cites
him
as
a
singular
instance
of
a
man
who
having
passed
the
early
part
of
his
life
as
a
soldier
never
having
had
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
as
the
case
might
have
been
of
a
scientific
training
instead
of
remaining
a
country
gentleman
has
succeeded
by
his
own
native
vigour
and
sagacity
untiring
industry
and
zeal
in
making
for
himself
a
scientific
reputation
that
is
as
wide
as
it
is
likely
to
be
lasting
he
took
first
of
all
an
unexplored
and
difficult
district
at
home
and
by
the
labour
of
many
years
examined
its
classed
them
in
natural
groups
assigned
to
each
its
characteristic
assemblage
of
fossils
and
was
the
first
to
decipher
two
great
chapters
in
the
world
s
geological
history
which
must
always
henceforth
carry
his
name
on
their
not
only
so
but
he
applied
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
to
the
dissection
of
large
districts
both
at
home
and
abroad
so
as
to
become
the
geological
discoverer
of
great
countries
which
had
formerly
been
terræ
but
sir
roderick
murchison
is
not
merely
a
geologist
his
indefatigable
labours
in
many
branches
of
knowledge
have
contributed
to
render
him
among
the
most
accomplished
and
complete
of
scientific
men

every

he
said
whoever

indeed

must
bring
all
his

upon

although

for
the

it
is
equally
true
that
without

no

by

yet
this

motive
indeed

and

always
been
its
best
reward

when
michael
angelo
was
asked
his
opinion
respecting
a
work
which
a
painter
had
taken
great
pains
to
exhibit
for
profit
he
said
i

that

long
as
he
shows
such
an
extreme
eagerness
to
become
like
sir

michael
angelo
was
a
great
believer
in
the
force
of
labour
and
he
held
that
there
was
nothing
which
the
imagination
conceived
that
could
not
be
embodied
in
marble
if
the
hand
were
made
vigorously
to
obey
the
mind
he
was
himself
one
of
the
most
indefatigable
of
workers
and
he
attributed
his
power
of
studying
for
a
greater
number
of
hours
than
most
of
his
contemporaries
to
his
spare
habits
of
living
a
little
bread
and
wine
was
all
he
required
for
the
chief
part
of
the
day
when
employed
at
his
work
and
very
frequently
he
rose
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
resume
his
labours
on
these
occasions
it
was
his
practice
to
fix
the
candle
by
the
light
of
which
he
chiselled
on
the
summit
of
a
cap
which
he
wore
sometimes
he
was
too
wearied
to
undress
and
he
slept
in
his
clothes
ready
to
spring
to
his
work

soon
as
refreshed
by
sleep
he

for
his
slowness

he
made

painting

it
was
eminently
characteristic
of
the
industry
of
the
late
sir
augustus
callcott
that
he
made
not
fewer
than
forty
separate
sketches
in
the
composition
of
his
famous
picture
of
this
constant
repetition
is
one
of
the
main
conditions
of
success
in
art
as
in
life
itself
no
matter
how
generous
nature
has
been
in
bestowing
the
gift
of
genius
the
pursuit
of
art
is
nevertheless
a
long
and
continuous
labour
many
artists
have
been
precocious
but
without
diligence
their
precocity
would
have
come
to
nothing
the
anecdote
related
of
west
is
well
known
when
only
seven
years
old
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
sleeping
infant
of
his
eldest
sister
whilst
watching
by
its
cradle
he
ran
to
seek
some
paper
and
forthwith
drew
its
portrait
in
red
and
black
ink
the
little
incident
revealed
the
artist
in
him
and
it
was
found
impossible
to
draw
him
from
his
bent
west
might
have
been
a
greater
painter
had
he
not
been
injured
by
too
early
success
his
fame
though
great
was
not
purchased
by
study
trials
and
difficulties
and
it
has
not
been
enduring

when
a
mere
child
indulged
himself
with
tracing
figures
of
men
and
animals
on
the
walls
of
his
father
s
house
with
a
burnt
stick
he
first
directed
his
attention
to
portrait
painting
but
when
in
italy
calling
one
day
at
the
house
of
zucarelli
and
growing
weary
with
waiting
he
began
painting
the
scene
on
which
his
friend
s
chamber
window
looked
when
zucarelli
arrived
he
was
so
charmed
with
the
picture
that
he
asked
if

had
not
studied

to
which

replied
that
he
had
not

reynolds
when
a
boy
forgot
his
lessons
and
took
pleasure
only
in
drawing
for
which
his
father
was
accustomed
to
rebuke
him
the
boy
was
destined
for
the
profession
of
physic
but
his
strong
instinct
for
art
could
not
be
repressed
and
he
became
a
painter

sketching
when
a
schoolboy
in

william
blake
a
hosier

son
employed
himself
in
drawing
designs
on
the
backs
of
his
father
s
and
making
sketches
on
the
counter
edward
bird
when
a
child
only
three
or
four
years
old
would
mount
a
chair
and
draw
figures
on
the
walls
which
he
called
french
and
english
soldiers
a
box
of
colours
was
purchased
for
him
and
his
father
desirous
of
turning
his
love
of
art
to
account
put
him
apprentice
to
a
maker
of
out
of
this
trade
he
gradually
raised
himself
by
study
and
labour
to
the
rank
of
a
royal
academician
hogarth
though
a
very
dull
boy
at
his
lessons
took
pleasure
in
making
drawings
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
his
school
exercises
were
more
remarkable
for
the
ornaments
with
which
he
embellished
them
than
for
the
matter
of
the
exercises
themselves
in
the
latter
respect
he
was
beaten
by
all
the
blockheads
of
the
school
but
in
his
adornments
he
stood
alone
his
father
put
him
apprentice
to
a
silversmith
where
he
learnt
to
draw
and
also
to
engrave
spoons
and
forks
with
crests
and
ciphers
from
he
went
on
to
teach
himself
engraving
on
copper
principally
griffins
and
monsters
of
heraldry
in
the
course
of
which
practice
he
became
ambitious
to
delineate
the
varieties
of
human
character
the
singular
excellence
which
he
reached
in
this
art
was
mainly
the
result
of
careful
observation
and
study
he
had
the
gift
which
he
sedulously
cultivated
of
committing
to
memory
the
precise
features
of
any
remarkable
face
and
afterwards
reproducing
them
on
paper
but
if
any
singularly
fantastic
form
or
face
came
in
his
way
he
would
make
a
sketch
of
it
on
the
spot
upon
his
and
carry
it
home
to
expand
at
his
leisure
everything
fantastical
and
original
had
a
powerful
attraction
for
him
and
he
wandered
into
many
places
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
with
character
by
this
careful
storing
of
his
mind
he
was
afterwards
enabled
to
crowd
an
immense
amount
of
thought
and
treasured
observation
into
his
works
hence
it
is
that
hogarth
s
pictures
are
so
truthful
a
memorial
of
the
character
the
manners
and
even
the
very
thoughts
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
true
painting
he
himself
observed
can
only
be
learnt
in
one
school
and
that
is
kept
by
nature
but
he
was
not
a
highly
cultivated
man
except
in
his
own
walk
his
school
education
had
been
of
the
slenderest
kind
scarcely
even
perfecting
him
in
the
art
of
spelling
his
did
the
rest
for
a
long
time
he
was
in
very
straitened
circumstances
but
nevertheless
worked
on
with
a
cheerful
heart
poor
though
he
was
he
contrived
to
live
within
his
small
means
and
he
boasted
with
becoming
pride
that
he
was
a
punctual
when
he
had
conquered
all
his
difficulties
and
become
a
famous
and
thriving
man
he
loved
to
dwell
upon
his
early
labours
and
privations
and
to
fight
over
again
the
battle
which
ended
so
honourably
to
him
as
a
man
and
so
gloriously
as
an
artist
i
remember
the
time
said
he
on
one
occasion
when
i
have
gone
moping
into
the
city
with
scarce
a
shilling
but
as
soon
as
i
have
received
ten
guineas
there
for
a
plate
i
have
returned
home
put
on
my
sword
and
sallied
out
with
all
the
confidence
of
a
man
who
had
thousands
in
his
industry
and
perseverance
was
the
motto
of
the
sculptor
banks
which
he
acted
on
himself
and
strongly
recommended
to
others
his
kindness
induced
many
aspiring
youths
to
call
upon
him
and
ask
for
his
advice
and
assistance
and
it
is
related
that
one
day
a
boy
called
at
his
door
to
see
him
with
this
object
but
the
servant
angry
at
the
loud
knock
he
had
given
scolded
him
and
was
about
sending
him
away
when
banks
overhearing
her
himself
went
out
the
little
boy
stood
at
the
door
with
some
drawings
in
his
hand
what
do
you
want
with
me
asked
the
sculptor
i
want
sir
if
you
please
to
be
admitted
to
draw
at
the
banks
explained
that
he
himself
could
not
procure
his
admission
but
he
asked
to
look
at
the
boy
s
drawings
examining
them
he
said
time
enough
for
the
academy
my
little
man
go
your
to
make
a
better
drawing
of
the
in
a
month
come
again
and
let
me
see
the
boy
went
and
worked
with
redoubled
at
the
end
of
the
month
called
again
on
the
sculptor
the
drawing
was
better
but
again
banks
sent
him
back
with
good
advice
to
work
and
study
in
a
week
the
boy
was
again
at
his
door
his
drawing
much
improved
and
banks
bid
him
be
of
good
cheer
for
if
spared
he
would
distinguish
himself
the
boy
was
mulready
and
the
sculptor
s
augury
was
amply
fulfilled
the
fame
of
claude
lorraine
is
partly
explained
by
his
indefatigable
industry
born
at
champagne
in
lorraine
of
poor
parents
he
was
first
apprenticed
to
a
pastrycook
his
brother
who
was
a
afterwards
took
him
into
his
shop
to
learn
that
trade
having
there
shown
indications
of
artistic
skill
a
travelling
dealer
persuaded
the
brother
to
allow
claude
to
accompany
him
to
italy
he
assented
and
the
young
man
reached
rome
where
he
was
shortly
after
engaged
by
agostino
tassi
the
landscape
painter
as
his
in
that
capacity
claude
first
learnt
landscape
painting
and
in
course
of
time
he
began
to
produce
pictures
we
next
find
him
making
the
tour
of
italy
france
and
germany
occasionally
resting
by
the
way
to
paint
landscapes
and
thereby
replenish
his
purse
on
returning
to
rome
he
found
an
increasing
demand
for
his
works
and
his
reputation
at
length
became
european
he
was
unwearied
in
the
study
of
nature
in
her
various
aspects
it
was
his
practice
to
spend
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
closely
copying
buildings
bits
of
ground
trees
leaves
and
such
like
which
he
finished
in
detail
keeping
the
drawings
by
him
in
store
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
them
in
his
studied
landscapes
he
also
gave
close
attention
to
the
sky
watching
it
for
whole
days
from
morning
till
night
and
noting
the
various
changes
occasioned
by
the
passing
clouds
and
the
increasing
and
waning
light
by
this
constant
practice
he
acquired
although
it
is
said
very
slowly
such
a
mastery
of
hand
and
eye
as
eventually
secured
for
him
the
first
rank
among
landscape
painters
turner
who
has
been
styled
the
english
claude
pursued
a
career
of
like
laborious
industry
he
was
destined
by
his
father
for
his
own
trade
of
a
barber
which
he
carried
on
in
london
until
one
day
the
sketch
which
the
boy
had
made
of
a
coat
of
arms
on
a
silver
salver
having
attracted
the
notice
of
a
customer
whom
his
father
was
shaving
the
latter
was
urged
to
allow
his
son
to
follow
his
bias
and
he
was
eventually
permitted
to
follow
art
as
a
profession
like
all
young
artists
turner
had
many
difficulties
to
encounter
and
they
were
all
the
greater
that
his
circumstances
were
so
straitened
but
he
was
always
willing
to
work
and
to
take
pains
with
his
work
no
matter
how
humble
it
might
be
he
was
glad
to
hire
himself
out
at
a
night
to
wash
in
skies
in
indian
ink
upon
other
people
s
drawings
getting
his
supper
into
the
bargain
thus
he
earned
money
and
acquired
expertness
then
he
took
to
illustrating
almanacs
and
any
sort
of
books
that
wanted
cheap
frontispieces
what
could
i
have
done
better
said
he
afterwards
it
was
he
did
everything
carefully
and
conscientiously
never
slurring
over
his
work
because
he
was
for
it
he
aimed
at
learning
as
well
as
living
always
doing
his
best
and
never
leaving
a
drawing
without
having
made
a
step
in
advance
upon
his
previous
work
a
man
who
thus
laboured
was
sure
to
do
much
and
his
growth
in
power
and
grasp
of
thought
was
to
use
ruskin
s
words
as
steady
as
the
increasing
light
of
but
turner
s
genius
needs
no
panegyric
his
best
monument
is
the
noble
gallery
of
pictures
bequeathed
by
him
to
the
nation
which
will
ever
be
the
most
lasting
memorial
of
his
fame
to
reach
rome
the
capital
of
the
fine
arts
is
usually
the
highest
ambition
of
the
art
student
but
the
journey
to
rome
is
costly
and
the
student
is
often
poor
with
a
will
resolute
to
overcome
difficulties
rome
may
however
at
last
be
reached
thus
françois
perrier
an
early
french
painter
in
his
eager
desire
to
visit
the
eternal
city
consented
to
act
as
guide
to
a
blind
vagrant
after
long
wanderings
he
reached
the
vatican
studied
and
became
famous
not
less
enthusiasm
was
displayed
by
jacques
callot
in
his
determination
to
visit
rome
though
opposed
by
his
father
in
his
wish
to
be
an
artist
the
boy
would
not
be
baulked
but
fled
from
home
to
make
his
way
to
italy
having
set
out
without
means
he
was
soon
reduced
to
great
straits
but
falling
in
with
a
band
of
gipsies
he
joined
their
company
and
wandered
about
with
them
from
one
fair
to
another
sharing
in
their
numerous
adventures
during
this
remarkable
journey
callot
picked
up
much
of
that
extraordinary
knowledge
of
figure
feature
and
character
which
he
afterwards
reproduced
sometimes
in
such
exaggerated
forms
in
his
wonderful
engravings
when
callot
at
length
reached
florence
a
gentleman
pleased
with
his
ingenious
ardour
placed
him
with
an
artist
to
study
but
he
was
not
satisfied
to
stop
short
of
rome
and
we
find
him
shortly
on
his
way
thither
at
rome
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
porigi
and
thomassin
who
on
seeing
his
crayon
sketches
predicted
for
him
a
brilliant
career
as
an
artist
but
a
friend
of
callot
s
family
having
accidentally
encountered
him
took
steps
to
compel
the
fugitive
to
return
home
by
this
time
he
had
acquired
such
a
love
of
wandering
that
he
could
not
rest
so
he
ran
away
a
second
time
and
a
second
time
he
was
brought
back
by
his
elder
brother
who
caught
him
at
turin
at
last
the
father
seeing
resistance
was
in
vain
gave
his
reluctant
consent
to
callot
s
prosecuting
his
studies
at
rome
thither
he
went
accordingly
and
this
time
he
remained
diligently
studying
design
and
engraving
for
several
years
under
competent
masters
on
his
way
back
to
france
he
was
encouraged
by
cosmo
ii
to
remain
at
florence
where
he
studied
and
worked
for
several
years
more
on
the
death
of
his
patron
he
returned
to
his
family
at
nancy
where
by
the
use
of
his
burin
and
needle
he
shortly
acquired
both
wealth
and
fame
when
nancy
was
taken
by
siege
during
the
civil
wars
callot
was
requested
by
richelieu
to
make
a
design
and
engraving
of
the
event
but
the
artist
would
not
commemorate
the
disaster
which
had
befallen
his
native
place
and
he
refused
richelieu
could
not
shake
his
resolution
and
threw
him
into
prison
there
callot
met
with
some
of
his
old
friends
the
gipsies
who
had
relieved
his
wants
on
his
first
journey
to
rome
when
louis
xiii
heard
of
his
imprisonment
he
not
only
released
him
but
offered
to
grant
him
any
favour
he
might
ask
callot
immediately
requested
that
his
old
companions
the
gipsies
might
be
set
free
and
permitted
to
beg
in
paris
without
molestation
this
odd
request
was
granted
on
condition
that
callot
should
engrave
their
portraits
and
hence
his
curious
book
of
engravings
entitled
the
louis
is
said
to
have
offered
callot
a
pension
of
livres
provided
he
would
not
leave
paris
but
the
artist
was
now
too
much
of
a
bohemian
and
prized
his
liberty
too
highly
to
permit
him
to
accept
it
and
he
returned
to
nancy
where
he
worked
till
his
death
his
industry
may
be
inferred
from
the
number
of
his
engravings
and
etchings
of
which
he
left
not
fewer
than
he
was
especially
fond
of
grotesque
subjects
which
he
treated
with
great
skill
his
free
etchings
touched
with
the
graver
being
executed
with
especial
delicacy
and
wonderful
minuteness
still
more
romantic
and
adventurous
was
the
career
of
benvenuto
cellini
the
marvellous
gold
worker
painter
sculptor
engraver
engineer
and
author
his
life
as
told
by
himself
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
autobiographies
ever
written
giovanni
cellini
his
father
was
one
of
the
court
musicians
to
lorenzo
de
medici
at
florence
and
his
highest
ambition
concerning
his
son
benvenuto
was
that
he
should
become
an
expert
player
on
the
flute
but
giovanni
having
lost
his
appointment
found
it
necessary
to
send
his
son
to
learn
some
trade
and
he
was
apprenticed
to
a
goldsmith
the
boy
had
already
displayed
a
love
of
drawing
and
of
art
and
applying
himself
to
his
business
he
soon
became
a
dexterous
workman
having
got
mixed
up
in
a
quarrel
with
some
of
the
townspeople
he
was
banished
for
six
months
during
which
period
he
worked
with
a
goldsmith
at
sienna
gaining
further
experience
in
jewellery
and
his
father
still
insisting
on
his
becoming
a
benvenuto
continued
to
practise
on
the
instrument
though
he
detested
it
his
chief
pleasure
was
in
art
which
he
pursued
with
enthusiasm
returning
to
florence
he
carefully
studied
the
designs
of
leonardo
da
vinci
and
michael
angelo
and
still
further
to
improve
himself
in
he
went
on
foot
to
rome
where
he
met
with
a
variety
of
adventures
he
returned
to
florence
with
the
reputation
of
being
a
most
expert
worker
in
the
precious
metals
and
his
skill
was
soon
in
great
request
but
being
of
an
irascible
temper
he
was
constantly
getting
into
scrapes
and
was
frequently
under
the
necessity
of
flying
for
his
life
thus
he
fled
from
florence
in
the
disguise
of
a
friar
again
taking
refuge
at
sienna
and
afterwards
at
rome
during
his
second
residence
in
rome
cellini
met
with
extensive
patronage
and
he
was
taken
into
the
pope
s
service
in
the
double
capacity
of
goldsmith
and
musician
he
was
constantly
studying
and
improving
himself
by
acquaintance
with
the
works
of
the
best
masters
he
mounted
jewels
finished
enamels
engraved
seals
and
designed
and
executed
works
in
gold
silver
and
bronze
in
such
a
style
as
to
excel
all
other
artists
whenever
he
heard
of
a
goldsmith
who
was
famous
in
any
particular
branch
he
immediately
determined
to
surpass
him
thus
it
was
that
he
rivalled
the
medals
of
one
the
enamels
of
another
and
the
jewellery
of
a
third
in
fact
there
was
not
a
branch
of
his
business
that
he
did
not
feel
impelled
to
excel
in
working
in
this
spirit
it
is
not
so
wonderful
that
cellini
should
have
been
able
to
accomplish
so
much
he
was
a
man
of
indefatigable
activity
and
was
constantly
on
the
move
at
one
time
we
find
him
at
florence
at
another
at
rome
then
he
is
at
mantua
at
rome
at
naples
and
back
to
florence
again
then
at
venice
and
in
paris
making
all
his
long
journeys
on
horseback
he
could
not
carry
much
luggage
with
him
so
wherever
he
went
he
usually
began
by
making
his
own
tools
he
not
only
designed
his
works
but
executed
them
himself
and
carved
and
cast
and
shaped
them
with
his
own
hands
indeed
his
works
have
the
impress
of
genius
so
clearly
stamped
upon
them
that
they
could
never
have
been
designed
by
one
person
and
executed
by
another
the
humblest
buckle
for
a
lady
s
girdle
a
seal
a
locket
a
brooch
a
ring
or
a
in
his
hands
a
beautiful
work
of
art
cellini
was
remarkable
for
his
readiness
and
dexterity
in
handicraft
one
day
a
surgeon
entered
the
shop
of
raffaello
del
moro
the
goldsmith
to
perform
an
operation
on
his
daughter
s
hand
on
looking
at
the
surgeon
s
instruments
cellini
who
was
present
found
them
rude
and
clumsy
as
they
usually
were
in
those
days
and
he
asked
the
surgeon
to
proceed
no
further
with
the
operation
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
then
ran
to
his
shop
and
taking
a
piece
of
the
finest
steel
wrought
out
of
it
a
beautifully
finished
knife
with
which
the
operation
was
successfully
performed
among
the
statues
executed
by
cellini
the
most
important
are
the
silver
figure
of
jupiter
executed
at
paris
for
francis
and
the
perseus
executed
in
bronze
for
the
grand
duke
cosmo
of
florence
he
also
executed
statues
in
marble
of
apollo
hyacinthus
narcissus
and
neptune
the
extraordinary
incidents
connected
with
the
casting
of
the
perseus
were
peculiarly
illustrative
of
the
remarkable
character
of
the
man
the
grand
duke
having
expressed
a
decided
opinion
that
the
model
when
shown
to
him
in
wax
could
not
possibly
be
cast
in
bronze
cellini
was
immediately
stimulated
by
the
predicted
impossibility
not
only
to
attempt
but
to
do
it
he
first
made
the
clay
model
baked
it
and
covered
it
with
wax
which
he
shaped
into
the
perfect
form
of
a
statue
then
coating
the
wax
with
a
sort
of
earth
he
baked
the
second
covering
during
which
the
wax
dissolved
and
escaped
leaving
the
space
between
the
two
layers
for
the
reception
of
the
metal
to
avoid
disturbance
the
latter
process
was
conducted
in
a
pit
dug
immediately
under
the
furnace
from
which
the
liquid
metal
was
to
be
introduced
by
pipes
and
apertures
into
the
mould
prepared
for
it
cellini
had
purchased
and
laid
in
several
loads
of
in
anticipation
of
the
process
of
casting
which
now
began
the
furnace
was
filled
with
pieces
of
brass
and
bronze
and
the
fire
was
lit
the
resinous
was
soon
in
such
a
furious
blaze
that
the
shop
took
fire
and
part
of
the
roof
was
burnt
while
at
the
same
time
the
wind
blowing
and
the
rain
filling
on
the
furnace
kept
down
the
heat
and
prevented
the
metals
from
melting
for
hours
cellini
struggled
to
keep
up
the
heat
continually
throwing
in
more
wood
until
at
length
he
became
so
exhausted
and
ill
that
he
feared
he
should
die
before
the
statue
could
be
cast
he
was
forced
to
leave
to
his
assistants
the
pouring
in
of
the
metal
when
melted
and
betook
himself
to
his
bed
while
those
about
him
were
condoling
with
him
in
his
distress
a
workman
suddenly
entered
the
room
lamenting
that
poor
benvenuto
s
work
was
irretrievably
spoiled
on
hearing
this
cellini
immediately
sprang
from
his
bed
and
rushed
to
the
workshop
where
he
found
the
fire
so
much
gone
down
that
the
metal
had
again
become
hard
sending
across
to
a
neighbour
for
a
load
of
young
oak
which
had
been
more
than
a
year
in
drying
he
soon
had
the
fire
blazing
again
and
the
metal
melting
and
glittering
the
wind
was
however
still
blowing
with
fury
and
the
rain
falling
heavily
so
to
protect
himself
cellini
had
some
tables
with
pieces
of
tapestry
and
old
clothes
brought
to
him
behind
which
he
went
on
hurling
the
wood
into
the
furnace
a
mass
of
pewter
was
thrown
in
upon
the
other
metal
and
by
stirring
sometimes
with
iron
and
sometimes
with
long
poles
the
whole
soon
became
completely
melted
at
this
juncture
when
the
trying
moment
was
close
at
hand
a
terrible
noise
as
of
a
thunderbolt
was
heard
and
a
glittering
of
fire
flashed
before
cellini
s
eyes
the
cover
of
the
furnace
had
burst
and
the
metal
began
to
flow
finding
that
it
did
not
run
with
the
proper
velocity
cellini
rushed
into
the
kitchen
bore
away
every
piece
of
copper
and
pewter
that
it
two
hundred
porringers
dishes
and
kettles
of
different
threw
them
into
the
furnace
then
at
length
the
metal
flowed
freely
and
thus
the
splendid
statue
of
perseus
was
cast
the
divine
fury
of
genius
in
which
cellini
rushed
to
his
kitchen
and
stripped
it
of
its
utensils
for
the
purposes
of
his
furnace
will
remind
the
reader
of
the
like
act
of
pallissy
in
breaking
up
his
furniture
for
the
purpose
of
baking
his
earthenware
excepting
however
in
their
enthusiasm
no
two
men
could
be
less
alike
in
character
cellini
was
an
ishmael
against
whom
according
to
his
own
account
every
man
s
hand
was
turned
but
about
his
extraordinary
skill
as
a
workman
and
his
genius
as
an
artist
there
can
not
be
two
opinions
much
less
turbulent
was
the
career
of
nicolas
poussin
a
man
as
pure
and
elevated
in
his
ideas
of
art
as
he
was
in
his
daily
life
and
distinguished
alike
for
his
vigour
of
intellect
his
rectitude
of
character
and
his
noble
simplicity
he
was
born
in
a
very
humble
station
at
andeleys
near
rouen
where
his
father
kept
a
small
school
the
boy
had
the
benefit
of
his
parent
s
instruction
such
as
it
was
but
of
that
he
is
said
to
have
been
somewhat
negligent
preferring
to
spend
his
time
in
covering
his
and
his
slate
with
drawings
a
country
painter
much
pleased
with
his
sketches
besought
his
parents
not
to
thwart
him
in
his
tastes
the
painter
agreed
to
give
poussin
lessons
and
he
soon
made
such
progress
that
his
master
had
nothing
more
to
teach
him
becoming
restless
and
desirous
of
further
improving
himself
poussin
at
the
age
of
set
out
for
paris
painting
signboards
on
his
way
for
a
maintenance
at
paris
a
new
world
of
art
opened
before
him
exciting
his
wonder
and
stimulating
his
emulation
he
worked
diligently
in
many
studios
drawing
copying
and
painting
pictures
after
a
time
he
resolved
if
possible
to
visit
rome
and
set
out
on
his
journey
but
he
only
succeeded
in
getting
as
far
as
florence
and
again
returned
to
paris
a
second
attempt
which
he
made
to
reach
rome
was
even
less
successful
for
this
time
he
only
got
as
far
as
lyons
he
was
nevertheless
careful
to
take
advantage
of
all
opportunities
for
improvement
which
came
in
his
way
and
continued
as
sedulous
as
before
in
studying
and
working
thus
twelve
years
passed
years
of
obscurity
and
toil
of
failures
and
disappointments
and
probably
of
privations
at
length
poussin
succeeded
in
reaching
rome
there
he
diligently
studied
the
old
masters
and
especially
the
ancient
statues
with
whose
perfection
he
was
greatly
impressed
for
some
time
he
lived
with
the
sculptor
duquesnoi
as
poor
as
himself
and
assisted
him
in
modelling
figures
after
the
antique
with
him
he
carefully
measured
some
of
the
most
celebrated
statues
in
rome
more
particularly
the
antinous
and
it
is
supposed
that
this
practice
exercised
considerable
influence
on
the
formation
of
his
future
style
at
the
same
time
he
studied
anatomy
practised
drawing
from
the
life
and
made
a
great
store
of
sketches
of
postures
and
attitudes
of
people
whom
he
met
carefully
reading
at
his
leisure
such
standard
books
on
art
as
he
could
borrow
from
his
friends
during
all
this
time
he
remained
very
poor
satisfied
to
be
continually
improving
himself
he
was
glad
to
sell
his
pictures
for
whatever
they
would
bring
one
of
a
prophet
he
sold
for
eight
livres
and
another
the
plague
of
the
philistines
he
sold
for
picture
afterwards
bought
by
cardinal
de
richelieu
for
a
thousand
to
add
to
his
troubles
he
was
stricken
by
a
cruel
malady
during
the
helplessness
occasioned
by
which
the
chevalier
del
posso
assisted
him
with
money
for
this
gentleman
poussin
afterwards
painted
the
rest
in
the
desert
a
fine
picture
which
far
more
than
repaid
the
advances
made
during
his
illness
the
brave
man
went
on
toiling
and
learning
through
suffering
still
aiming
at
higher
things
he
went
to
florence
and
venice
enlarging
the
range
of
his
studies
the
fruits
of
his
conscientious
labour
at
length
appeared
in
the
series
of
great
pictures
which
he
now
began
to
produce
death
of
germanicus
followed
by
extreme
unction
the
testament
of
eudamidas
the
manna
and
the
abduction
of
the
the
reputation
of
poussin
however
grew
but
slowly
he
was
of
a
retiring
disposition
and
shunned
society
people
gave
him
credit
for
being
a
thinker
much
more
than
a
painter
when
not
actually
employed
in
painting
he
took
long
solitary
walks
in
the
country
meditating
the
designs
of
future
pictures
one
of
his
few
friends
while
at
rome
was
claude
lorraine
with
whom
he
spent
many
hours
at
a
time
on
the
terrace
of
la
conversing
about
art
and
antiquarianism
the
monotony
and
the
quiet
of
rome
were
suited
to
his
taste
and
provided
he
could
earn
a
moderate
living
by
his
brush
he
had
no
wish
to
leave
it
but
his
fame
now
extended
beyond
rome
and
repeated
invitations
were
sent
him
to
return
to
paris
he
was
offered
the
appointment
of
principal
painter
to
the
king
at
first
he
hesitated
quoted
the
italian
proverb
sta
bene
non
si
said
he
had
lived
fifteen
years
in
rome
married
a
wife
there
and
looked
forward
to
dying
and
being
buried
there
urged
again
he
consented
and
returned
to
paris
but
his
appearance
there
awakened
much
professional
jealousy
and
he
soon
wished
himself
back
in
rome
again
while
in
paris
he
painted
some
of
his
greatest
saint
xavier
the
baptism
and
the
last
he
was
kept
constantly
at
work
at
first
he
did
whatever
he
was
asked
to
do
such
as
designing
frontispieces
for
the
royal
books
more
particularly
a
bible
and
a
virgil
cartoons
for
the
louvre
and
designs
for
tapestry
but
at
length
he
expostulated
it
is
impossible
for
me
he
said
to
de
chanteloup
to
work
at
the
same
time
at
frontispieces
for
books
at
a
virgin
at
a
picture
of
the
congregation
of
louis
at
the
various
designs
for
the
gallery
and
finally
at
designs
for
the
royal
tapestry
i
have
only
one
pair
of
hands
and
a
feeble
head
and
can
neither
be
helped
nor
can
my
labours
be
lightened
by
annoyed
by
the
enemies
his
success
had
provoked
and
whom
he
was
unable
to
conciliate
he
determined
at
the
end
of
less
than
two
years
labour
in
paris
to
return
to
rome
again
settled
there
in
his
humble
dwelling
on
mont
pincio
he
employed
himself
diligently
in
the
practice
of
his
art
during
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
living
in
great
simplicity
and
privacy
though
suffering
much
from
the
disease
which
afflicted
him
he
solaced
himself
by
study
always
striving
after
excellence
in
growing
old
he
said
i
feel
myself
becoming
more
and
more
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
surpassing
myself
and
reaching
the
highest
degree
of
thus
toiling
struggling
and
suffering
poussin
spent
his
later
years
he
had
no
children
his
wife
died
before
him
all
his
friends
were
gone
so
that
in
his
old
age
he
was
left
absolutely
alone
in
rome
so
full
of
tombs
and
died
there
in
bequeathing
to
his
relatives
at
andeleys
the
savings
of
his
life
amounting
to
about
crowns
and
leaving
behind
him
as
a
legacy
to
his
race
the
great
works
of
his
genius
the
career
of
ary
scheffer
furnishes
one
of
the
best
examples
in
modern
times
of
a
like
devotion
to
art
born
at
dordrecht
the
son
of
a
german
artist
he
early
manifested
an
aptitude
for
drawing
and
painting
which
his
parents
encouraged
his
father
dying
while
he
was
still
young
his
mother
resolved
though
her
means
were
but
small
to
remove
the
family
to
paris
in
order
that
her
son
might
obtain
the
best
opportunities
for
instruction
there
young
scheffer
was
placed
with
guérin
the
painter
but
his
mother
s
means
were
too
limited
to
permit
him
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
study
she
had
sold
the
few
jewels
she
possessed
and
refused
herself
every
indulgence
in
order
to
forward
the
instruction
of
her
other
children
under
such
circumstances
it
was
natural
that
ary
should
wish
to
help
her
and
by
the
time
he
was
eighteen
years
of
age
he
began
to
paint
small
pictures
of
simple
subjects
which
met
with
a
ready
sale
at
moderate
prices
he
also
practised
portrait
painting
at
the
same
time
gathering
experience
and
earning
honest
money
he
gradually
improved
in
drawing
colouring
and
composition
the
baptism
marked
a
new
epoch
in
his
career
and
from
that
point
he
went
on
advancing
until
his
fame
culminated
in
his
pictures
illustrative
of
faust
his
francisca
de
rimini
christ
the
consoler
the
holy
women
st
monica
and
augustin
and
many
other
noble
works
the
amount
of
labour
thought
and
attention
says
grote
which
scheffer
brought
to
the
production
of
the
francisca
must
have
been
enormous
in
truth
his
technical
education
having
been
so
imperfect
he
was
forced
to
climb
the
steep
of
art
by
drawing
upon
his
own
resources
and
thus
whilst
his
hand
was
at
work
his
mind
was
engaged
in
meditation
he
had
to
try
various
processes
of
handling
and
experiments
in
colouring
to
paint
and
repaint
with
tedious
and
unremitting
assiduity
but
nature
had
endowed
him
with
that
which
proved
in
some
sort
an
equivalent
for
shortcomings
of
a
professional
kind
his
own
elevation
of
character
and
his
profound
sensibility
aided
him
in
acting
upon
the
feelings
of
others
through
the
medium
of
the
one
of
the
artists
whom
scheffer
most
admired
was
flaxman
and
he
once
said
to
a
friend
if
i
have
unconsciously
borrowed
from
any
one
in
the
design
of
the
francisca
it
must
have
been
from
something
i
had
seen
among
flaxman
s
john
flaxman
was
the
son
of
a
humble
seller
of
plaster
casts
in
new
street
covent
garden
when
a
child
he
was
such
an
invalid
that
it
was
his
custom
to
sit
behind
his
father
s
shop
counter
propped
by
pillows
amusing
himself
with
drawing
and
reading
a
benevolent
clergyman
the
rev
matthews
calling
at
the
shop
one
day
saw
the
boy
trying
to
read
a
book
and
on
inquiring
what
it
was
found
it
to
be
a
cornelius
nepos
which
his
father
had
picked
up
for
a
few
pence
at
a
bookstall
the
gentleman
after
some
conversation
with
the
boy
said
that
was
not
the
proper
book
for
him
to
read
but
that
he
would
bring
him
one
the
next
day
he
called
with
translations
of
homer
and
don
quixote
which
the
boy
proceeded
to
read
with
great
avidity
his
mind
was
soon
filled
with
the
heroism
which
breathed
through
the
pages
of
the
former
and
with
the
stucco
ajaxes
and
achilleses
about
him
ranged
along
the
shop
shelves
the
ambition
took
possession
of
him
that
he
too
would
design
and
embody
in
poetic
forms
those
majestic
heroes
like
all
youthful
efforts
his
first
designs
were
crude
the
proud
father
one
day
showed
some
of
them
to
roubilliac
the
sculptor
who
turned
from
them
with
a
contemptuous
pshaw
but
the
boy
had
the
right
stuff
in
him
he
had
industry
and
patience
and
he
continued
to
labour
incessantly
at
his
books
and
drawings
he
then
tried
his
young
powers
in
modelling
figures
in
plaster
of
paris
wax
and
clay
some
of
these
early
works
are
still
preserved
not
because
of
their
merit
but
because
they
are
curious
as
the
first
healthy
efforts
of
patient
genius
it
was
long
before
the
boy
could
walk
and
he
only
learnt
to
do
so
by
hobbling
along
upon
crutches
at
length
he
became
strong
enough
to
walk
without
them
the
kind
matthews
invited
him
to
his
house
where
his
wife
explained
homer
and
milton
to
him
they
helped
him
also
in
his
him
lessons
in
greek
and
latin
the
study
of
which
he
prosecuted
at
home
by
dint
of
patience
and
perseverance
his
drawing
improved
so
much
that
he
obtained
a
commission
from
a
lady
to
execute
six
original
drawings
in
black
chalk
of
subjects
in
homer
his
first
commission
what

not
any
of
them
more
full
of
interest
to
the
aspirant
for
fame
than
the
artist
s
first
commission
the
boy
at
once
proceeded
to
execute
the
order
and
he
was
both
well
praised
and
well
paid
for
his
work
at
fifteen
flaxman
entered
a
pupil
at
the
royal
academy
notwithstanding
his
retiring
disposition
he
soon
became
known
among
the
students
and
great
things
were
expected
of
him
nor
were
their
expectations
disappointed
in
his
fifteenth
year
he
gained
the
silver
prize
and
next
year
he
became
a
candidate
for
the
gold
one
everybody
prophesied
that
he
would
carry
off
the
medal
for
there
was
none
who
surpassed
him
in
ability
and
industry
yet
he
lost
it
and
the
gold
medal
was
adjudged
to
a
pupil
who
was
not
afterwards
heard
of
this
failure
on
the
part
of
the
youth
was
really
of
service
to
him
for
defeats
do
not
long
cast
down
the
but
only
serve
to
call
forth
their
real
powers
give
me
time
said
he
to
his
father
and
i
will
yet
produce
works
that
the
academy
will
be
proud
to
he
redoubled
his
efforts
spared
no
pains
designed
and
modelled
incessantly
and
made
steady
if
not
rapid
progress
but
meanwhile
poverty
threatened
his
father
s
household
the
trade
yielded
a
very
bare
living
and
young
flaxman
with
resolute
curtailed
his
hours
of
study
and
devoted
himself
to
helping
his
father
in
the
humble
details
of
his
business
he
laid
aside
his
homer
to
take
up
the
he
was
willing
to
work
in
the
humblest
department
of
the
trade
so
that
his
father
s
family
might
be
supported
and
the
wolf
kept
from
the
door
to
this
drudgery
of
his
art
he
served
a
long
apprenticeship
but
it
did
him
good
it
familiarised
him
with
steady
work
and
cultivated
in
him
the
spirit
of
patience
the
discipline
may
have
been
hard
but
it
was
wholesome
happily
young
flaxman
s
skill
in
design
had
reached
the
knowledge
of
josiah
wedgwood
who
sought
him
out
for
the
purpose
of
employing
him
to
design
improved
patterns
of
china
and
earthenware
it
may
seem
a
humble
department
of
art
for
such
a
genius
as
flaxman
to
work
in
but
it
really
was
not
so
an
artist
may
be
labouring
truly
in
his
vocation
while
designing
a
common
teapot
or
articles
in

thus
confer
a

executing

to

in
some
wealthy
man
s
gallery
where
it
is
hidden
away
from
public
sight
before
wedgwood
s
time
the
designs
which
figured
upon
our
china
and
stoneware
were
hideous
both
in
drawing
and
execution
and
he
determined
to
improve
both
flaxman
did
his
best
to
carry
out
the
manufacturer
s
views
he
supplied
him
from
time
to
time
with
models
and
designs
of
various
pieces
of
earthenware
the
subjects
of
which
were
principally
from
ancient
verse
and
history
many
of
them
are
still
in
existence
and
some
are
equal
in
beauty
and
simplicity
to
his
after
designs
for
marble
the
celebrated
etruscan
vases
specimens
of
which
were
to
be
found
in
public
museums
and
in
the
cabinets
of
the
curious
furnished
him
with
the
best
examples
of
form
and
these
he
embellished
with
his
own
elegant
devices
stuart
s
athens
then
recently
published
furnished
him
with
specimens
of
the
greek
utensils
of
these
he
adopted
the
best
and
worked
them
into
new
shapes
of
elegance
and
beauty
flaxman
then
saw
that
he
was
labouring
in
a
great
less
than
the
promotion
of
popular
education
and
he
was
proud
in
after
life
to
allude
to
his
early
labours
in
this
walk
by
which
he
was
enabled
at
the
same
time
to
cultivate
his
love
of
the
beautiful
to
diffuse
a
taste
for
art
among
the
people
and
to
replenish
his
own
purse
while
he
promoted
the
prosperity
of
his
friend
and
benefactor
at
length
in
the
year
when
years
of
age
he
quitted
his
father
s
roof
and
rented
a
small
house
and
studio
in
wardour
street
soho
and
what
was
more
he
denman
was
the
name
of
his
a
cheerful
noble
woman
she
was
he
believed
that
in
marrying
her
he
should
be
able
to
work
with
an
intenser
spirit
for
like
him
she
had
a
taste
for
poetry
and
art
and
besides
was
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
her
husband
s
genius
yet
when
sir
joshua
a
flaxman
shortly
after
his
marriage
he
said
to
him
so
flaxman
i
am
told
you
are
married
if
so
sir
i
tell
you
you
are
ruined
for
an
flaxman
went
straight
home
sat
down
beside
his
wife
took
her
hand
in
his
and
said
ann
i
am
ruined
for
an
how
so
john
how
has
it
happened
and
who
has
done
it
it
happened
he
replied
in
the
church
and
ann
denman
has
done
he
then
told
her
of
sir
joshua
s
opinion
was
well
known
and
had
often
been
expressed
that
if
students
would
excel
they
must
bring
the
whole
powers
of
their
mind
to
bear
upon
their
art
from
the
moment
they
rose
until
they
went
to
bed
and
also
that
no
man
could
be
a
artist
unless
he
studied
the
grand
works
of
raffaelle
michael
angelo
and
others
at
rome
and
florence
and
i
said
flaxman
drawing
up
his
little
figure
to
its
full
height
would
be
a
great
and
a
great
artist
you
shall
be
said
his
wife
and
visit
rome
too
if
that
be
really
necessary
to
make
you
but
how
asked
flaxman
and
rejoined
the
brave
wife
i
will
never
have
it
said
that
ann
denman
ruined
john
flaxman
for
an
and
so
it
was
determined
by
the
pair
that
the
journey
to
rome
was
to
be
made
when
their
means
would
admit
i
will
go
to
rome
said
flaxman
and
show
the
president
that
wedlock
is
for
a
man
s
good
rather
than
his
harm
and
you
ann
shall
accompany
patiently
and
happily
the
affectionate
couple
plodded
on
during
five
years
in
their
humble
little
home
in
wardour
street
always
with
the
long
journey
to
rome
before
them
it
was
never
lost
sight
of
for
a
moment
and
not
a
penny
was
uselessly
spent
that
could
be
saved
towards
the
necessary
expenses
they
said
no
word
to
any
one
about
their
project
solicited
no
aid
from
the
academy
but
trusted
only
to
their
own
patient
labour
and
love
to
pursue
and
achieve
their
object
during
this
time
flaxman
exhibited
very
few
works
he
could
not
afford
marble
to
experiment
in
original
designs
but
he
obtained
frequent
commissions
for
monuments
by
the
profits
of
which
he
maintained
himself
he
still
worked
for
wedgwood
who
was
a
prompt
paymaster
and
on
the
whole
he
was
thriving
happy
and
hopeful
his
local
respectability
was
even
such
as
to
bring
local
honours
and
local
work
upon
him
for
he
was
elected
by
the
ratepayers
to
collect
the
for
the
parish
of
anne
when
he
might
be
seen
going
about
with
an
suspended
from
his
collecting
the
money
at
length
flaxman
and
his
wife
having
accumulated
a
sufficient
store
of
savings
set
out
for
rome
arrived
there
he
applied
himself
diligently
to
study
maintaining
himself
like
other
poor
artists
by
making
copies
from
the
antique
english
visitors
sought
his
studio
and
gave
him
commissions
and
it
was
then
that
he
composed
his
beautiful
designs
illustrative
of
homer
æschylus
and
dante
the
price
paid
for
them
was
fifteen
shillings
but
flaxman
worked
for
art
as
well
as
money
and
the
beauty
of
the
designs
brought
him
other
friends
and
patrons
he
executed
cupid
and
aurora
for
the
munificent
thomas
hope
and
the
fury
of
athamas
for
the
earl
of
bristol
he
then
prepared
to
return
to
england
his
taste
improved
and
cultivated
by
careful
study
but
before
he
left
italy
the
academies
of
florence
and
carrara
recognised
his
merit
by
electing
him
a
member
his
fame
had
preceded
him
to
london
where
he
soon
found
abundant
employment
while
at
rome
he
had
been
commissioned
to
execute
his
famous
monument
in
memory
of
lord
mansfield
and
it
was
erected
in
the
north
transept
of
westminster
abbey
shortly
after
his
return
it
stands
there
in
majestic
grandeur
a
monument
to
the
genius
of
flaxman
simple
and
severe
no
wonder
that
banks
the
sculptor
then
in
the
heyday
of
his
fame
exclaimed
when
he
saw
it
this
little
man
cuts
us
all
out
when
the
members
of
the
royal
academy
heard
of
flaxman
s
return
and
especially
when
they
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
admiring
his
of
mansfield
they
were
eager
to
have
him
enrolled
among
their
number
he
allowed
his
name
to
be
proposed
in
the
candidates
list
of
associates
and
was
immediately
elected
shortly
after
he
appeared
in
an
entirely
new
character
the
little
boy
who
had
begun
his
studies
behind
the
s
in
new
street
covent
garden
was
now
a
man
of
high
intellect
and
recognised
supremacy
in
art
to
instruct
students
in
the
character
of
professor
of
sculpture
to
the
royal
academy
and
no
man
better
deserved
to
fill
that
distinguished
office
for
none
is
so
able
to
instruct
others
as
he
who
for
himself
and
by
his
own
efforts
has
learnt
to
grapple
with
and
overcome
difficulties
after
a
long
peaceful
and
happy
life
flaxman
found
himself
growing
old
the
loss
which
he
sustained
by
the
death
of
his
affectionate
wife
ann
was
a
severe
shock
to
him
but
he
survived
her
several
years
during
which
he
executed
his
celebrated
shield
of
achilles
and
his
noble
archangel
michael
vanquishing
satan
his
two
greatest
works
chantrey
was
a
more
robust
man
rough
but
hearty
in
his
demeanour
proud
of
his
successful
struggle
with
the
difficulties
which
beset
him
in
early
life
and
above
all
proud
of
his
independence
he
was
born
a
poor
man
s
child
at
norton
near
sheffield
his
father
dying
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
his
mother
married
again
young
chantrey
used
to
drive
an
ass
laden
with
across
its
back
into
the
neighbouring
town
of
sheffield
and
there
serve
his
mother
s
customers
with
milk
such
was
the
humble
beginning
of
his
industrial
career
and
it
was
by
his
own
strength
that
he
rose
from
that
position
and
achieved
the
highest
eminence
as
an
artist
not
taking
kindly
to
his
the
boy
was
sent
to
trade
and
was
first
placed
with
a
grocer
in
sheffield
the
business
was
very
distasteful
to
him
but
passing
a
carver
s
shop
window
one
day
his
eye
was
attracted
by
the
glittering
articles
it
contained
and
charmed
with
the
idea
of
being
a
carver
he
begged
to
be
released
from
the
grocery
business
with
that
object
his
friends
consented
and
he
was
bound
apprentice
to
the
carver
and
gilder
for
seven
years
his
new
master
besides
being
a
carver
in
wood
was
also
a
dealer
in
prints
and
plaster
models
and
chantrey
at
once
set
about
imitating
both
studying
with
great
industry
and
energy
all
his
spare
hours
were
devoted
to
drawing
modelling
and
and
he
often
carried
his
labours
far
into
the
night
before
his
apprenticeship
was
the
ace
of
paid
over
to
his
master
the
whole
wealth
which
he
was
able
to
sum
of
cancel
his
indentures
determined
to
devote
himself
to
the
career
of
an
artist
he
then
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
london
and
with
characteristic
good
sense
sought
employment
as
an
assistant
carver
studying
painting
and
modelling
at
his
among
the
jobs
on
which
he
was
first
employed
as
a
journeyman
carver
was
the
decoration
of
the
of
rogers
the
room
in
which
he
was
in
after
years
a
welcome
visitor
and
he
usually
took
pleasure
in
pointing
out
his
early
handywork
to
the
guests
whom
he
met
at
his
friend
s
table
returning
to
sheffield
on
a
professional
visit
he
advertised
himself
in
the
local
papers
as
a
painter
of
portraits
in
crayons
and
miniatures
and
also
in
oil
for
his
first
crayon
portrait
he
was
paid
a
guinea
by
a
cutler
and
for
a
portrait
in
oil
a
confectioner
paid
him
as
much
as
and
a
pair
of
top
boots
chantrey
was
soon
in
london
again
to
study
at
the
royal
academy
and
next
time
he
returned
to
sheffield
he
advertised
himself
as
ready
to
model
plaster
busts
of
his
townsmen
as
well
as
paint
portraits
of
them
he
was
even
selected
to
design
a
monument
to
a
deceased
vicar
of
the
town
and
executed
it
to
the
general
satisfaction
when
in
london
he
used
a
room
over
a
stable
as
a
studio
and
there
he
modelled
his
first
original
work
for
exhibition
it
was
a
gigantic
head
of
satan
towards
the
close
of
chantrey
s
life
a
friend
passing
through
his
studio
was
struck
by
this
model
lying
in
a
corner
that
head
said
the
sculptor
was
the
first
thing
that
i
did
after
i
came
to
london
i
worked
at
it
in
a
garret
with
a
paper
cap
on
my
head
and
as
i
could
then
afford
only
one
candle
i
stuck
that
one
in
my
cap
that
it
might
move
along
with
me
and
give
me
light
whichever
way
i
flaxman
saw
and
admired
this
head
at
the
academy
exhibition
and
recommended
chantrey
for
the
execution
of
the
busts
of
four
admirals
required
for
the
naval
asylum
at
greenwich
this
commission
led
to
others
and
painting
was
given
up
but
for
eight
years
before
he
had
not
earned
by
his
modelling
his
famous
head
of
horne
tooke
was
such
a
success
that
according
to
his
own
account
it
brought
him
commissions
amounting
to
chantrey
had
now
succeeded
but
he
had
worked
hard
and
fairly
earned
his
good
fortune
he
was
selected
from
amongst
sixteen
competitors
to
execute
the
statue
of
george
iii
for
the
city
of
london
a
few
years
later
he
produced
the
exquisite
monument
of
the
sleeping
children
now
in
lichfield
cathedral
work
of
great
tenderness
and
beauty
and
thenceforward
his
career
was
one
of
increasing
honour
fame
and
prosperity
his
patience
industry
and
steady
perseverance
were
the
means
by
which
he
achieved
his
greatness
nature
endowed
him
with
genius
and
his
sound
sense
enabled
him
to
employ
the
precious
gift
as
a
blessing
he
was
prudent
and
shrewd
like
the
men
amongst
whom
he
was
born
the
which
accompanied
him
on
his
italian
tour
containing
mingled
notes
on
art
records
of
daily
expenses
and
the
current
prices
of
marble
his
tastes
were
simple
and
he
made
his
finest
subjects
great
by
the
mere
force
of
simplicity
his
statue
of
watt
in
handsworth
church
seems
to
us
the
very
consummation
of
art
yet
it
is
perfectly
artless
and
simple
his
generosity
to
brother
artists
in
need
was
splendid
but
quiet
and
unostentatious
he
left
the
principal
part
of
his
fortune
to
the
royal
academy
for
the
promotion
of
british
art
the
same
honest
and
persistent
industry
was
throughout
distinctive
of
the
career
of
david
wilkie
the
son
of
a
scotch
minister
he
gave
early
indications
of
an
artistic
turn
and
though
he
was
a
negligent
and
inapt
scholar
he
was
a
sedulous
drawer
of
faces
and
figures
a
silent
boy
he
already
displayed
that
quiet
concentrated
energy
of
character
which
distinguished
him
through
life
he
was
always
on
the
for
an
opportunity
to
draw
the
walls
of
the
manse
or
the
smooth
sand
by
the
river
side
were
alike
convenient
for
his
purpose
any
sort
of
tool
would
serve
him
like
giotto
he
found
a
pencil
in
a
burnt
stick
a
prepared
canvas
in
any
smooth
stone
and
the
subject
for
a
picture
in
every
ragged
mendicant
he
met
when
he
visited
a
house
he
generally
left
his
mark
on
the
walls
as
an
indication
of
his
presence
sometimes
to
the
disgust
of
cleanly
housewives
in
short
notwithstanding
the
aversion
of
his
father
the
minister
to
the
sinful
profession
of
painting
wilkie
s
strong
propensity
was
not
to
be
thwarted
and
he
became
an
artist
working
his
way
manfully
up
the
steep
of
difficulty
though
rejected
on
his
first
application
as
a
candidate
for
admission
to
the
scottish
academy
at
edinburgh
on
account
of
the
rudeness
and
inaccuracy
of
his
introductory
specimens
he
persevered
in
producing
better
until
he
was
admitted
but
his
progress
was
slow
he
applied
himself
diligently
to
the
drawing
of
the
human
figure
and
held
on
with
the
determination
to
succeed
as
if
with
a
resolute
confidence
in
the
result
he
displayed
none
of
the
eccentric
humour
and
fitful
application
of
many
youths
who
conceive
themselves
geniuses
but
kept
up
the
routine
of
steady
application
to
such
an
extent
that
he
himself
was
afterwards
accustomed
to
attribute
his
success
to
his
dogged
perseverance
rather
than
to
any
higher
innate
power
the
single
element
he
said
in
all
the
progressive
movements
of
my
pencil
was
persevering
at
edinburgh
he
gained
a
few
premiums
thought
of
turning
his
attention
to
portrait
painting
with
a
view
to
its
higher
and
more
certain
remuneration
but
eventually
went
boldly
into
the
line
in
which
he
earned
his
fame
painted
his
pitlessie
fair
what
was
bolder
still
he
determined
to
proceed
to
london
on
account
of
its
presenting
so
much
wider
a
field
for
study
and
work
and
the
poor
scotch
lad
arrived
in
town
and
painted
his
village
politicians
while
living
in
a
humble
lodging
on
eighteen
shillings
a
week
notwithstanding
the
success
of
this
picture
and
the
commissions
which
followed
it
wilkie
long
continued
poor
the
prices
which
his
works
realized
were
not
great
for
he
bestowed
upon
them
so
much
time
and
labour
that
his
earnings
continued
comparatively
small
for
many
years
every
picture
was
carefully
studied
and
elaborated
beforehand
nothing
was
struck
off
at
a
heat
many
occupied
him
for
retouching
and
improving
them
until
they
finally
passed
out
of
his
hands
as
with
reynolds
his
motto
was
work
work
work
and
like
him
he
expressed
great
dislike
for
talking
artists
talkers
may
sow
but
the
silent
reap
let
us
be
something
was
his
oblique
mode
of
rebuking
the
loquacious
and
admonishing
the
idle
he
once
related
to
his
friend
constable
that
when
he
studied
at
the
scottish
academy
graham
the
master
of
it
was
accustomed
to
say
to
the
students
in
the
words
of
reynolds
if
you
have
genius
industry
will
improve
it
if
you
have
none
industry
will
supply
its
so
said
wilkie
i
was
determined
to
be
very
industrious
for
i
knew
i
had
no
he
also
told
constable
that
when
linnell
and
burnett
his
in
london
were
talking
about
art
he
always
contrived
to
get
as
close
to
them
as
he
could
to
hear
all
they
said
for
said
he
they
know
a
great
deal
and
i
know
very
this
was
said
with
perfect
sincerity
for
wilkie
was
habitually
modest
one
of
the
first
things
that
he
did
with
the
sum
of
thirty
pounds
which
he
obtained
from
lord
mansfield
for
his
village
politicians
was
to
buy
a
bonnets
shawls
and
his
mother
and
sister
at
home
though
but
little
able
to
afford
it
at
the
time
wilkie
s
early
poverty
had
trained
him
in
habits
of
strict
economy
which
were
however
consistent
with
a
noble
liberality
as
appears
from
sundry
passages
in
the
autobiography
of
abraham
raimbach
the
engraver
william
etty
was
another
notable
instance
of
unflagging
industry
and
indomitable
perseverance
in
art
his
father
was
a
and
spicemaker
at
york
and
his
woman
of
considerable
force
and
originality
of
the
daughter
of
a
ropemaker
the
boy
early
displayed
a
love
of
drawing
covering
walls
floors
and
tables
with
specimens
of
his
skill
his
first
crayon
being
a
farthing
s
worth
of
chalk
and
this
giving
place
to
a
piece
of
coal
or
a
bit
of
charred
stick
his
mother
knowing
nothing
of
art
put
the
boy
apprentice
to
a
of
a
printer
but
in
his
leisure
hours
he
went
on
with
the
practice
of
drawing
and
when
his
time
was
out
he
determined
to
follow
his
would
be
a
painter
and
nothing
else
fortunately
his
uncle
and
elder
brother
were
able
and
willing
to
help
him
on
in
his
new
career
and
they
provided
him
with
the
means
of
entering
as
pupil
at
the
royal
academy
we
observe
from
leslie
s
autobiography
that
etty
was
looked
upon
by
his
fellow
students
as
a
worthy
but
dull
plodding
person
who
would
never
distinguish
himself
but
he
had
in
him
the
divine
faculty
of
work
and
diligently
plodded
his
way
upward
to
eminence
in
the
highest
walks
of
art
many
artists
have
had
to
encounter
privations
which
have
tried
their
courage
and
endurance
to
the
utmost
before
they
succeeded
what
number
may
have
sunk
under
them
we
can
never
know
martin
encountered
difficulties
in
the
course
of
his
career
such
as
perhaps
fall
to
the
lot
of
few
more
than
once
he
found
himself
on
the
verge
of
starvation
while
engaged
on
his
first
great
picture
it
is
related
of
him
that
on
one
occasion
he
found
himself
reduced
to
his
last
he
had
kept
because
of
its
very
brightness
but
at
length
he
found
it
necessary
to
exchange
it
for
bread
he
went
to
a
baker
s
shop
bought
a
loaf
and
was
taking
it
away
when
the
baker
snatched
it
from
him
and
tossed
back
the
shilling
to
the
starving
painter
the
bright
shilling
had
failed
him
in
his
hour
of
was
a
bad
one
returning
to
his
lodgings
he
rummaged
his
trunk
for
some
remaining
crust
to
satisfy
his
hunger
upheld
throughout
by
the
victorious
power
of
enthusiasm
he
pursued
his
design
with
unsubdued
energy
he
had
the
courage
to
work
on
and
to
wait
and
when
a
few
days
after
he
found
an
opportunity
to
exhibit
his
picture
he
was
from
that
time
famous
like
many
other
great
artists
his
life
proves
that
in
despite
of
outward
circumstances
genius
aided
by
industry
will
be
its
own
protector
and
that
fame
though
she
comes
late
will
never
ultimately
refuse
her
favours
to
real
merit
the
most
careful
discipline
and
training
after
academic
methods
will
fail
in
making
an
artist
unless
he
himself
take
an
active
part
in
the
work
like
every
highly
cultivated
man
he
must
be
mainly
when
pugin
who
was
brought
up
in
his
father
s
office
had
learnt
all
that
he
could
learn
of
architecture
according
to
the
usual
formulas
he
still
found
that
he
had
learned
but
little
and
that
he
must
begin
at
the
beginning
and
pass
through
the
discipline
of
labour
young
pugin
accordingly
hired
himself
out
as
a
common
carpenter
at
covent
garden
working
under
the
stage
then
behind
the
flys
then
upon
the
stage
itself
he
thus
acquired
a
familiarity
with
work
and
cultivated
an
architectural
taste
to
which
the
diversity
of
the
mechanical
employment
about
a
large
operatic
establishment
is
peculiarly
favourable
when
the
theatre
closed
for
the
season
he
worked
a
between
london
and
some
of
the
french
ports
carrying
on
at
the
same
time
a
profitable
trade
at
every
opportunity
he
would
land
and
make
drawings
of
any
old
building
and
especially
of
any
ecclesiastical
structure
which
fell
in
his
way
afterwards
he
would
make
special
journeys
to
the
continent
for
the
same
purpose
and
returned
home
laden
with
drawings
thus
he
plodded
and
laboured
on
making
sure
of
the
excellence
and
distinction
which
he
eventually
achieved
a
similar
illustration
of
plodding
industry
in
the
same
walk
is
presented
in
the
career
of
george
kemp
the
architect
of
the
beautiful
scott
monument
at
edinburgh
he
was
the
son
of
a
poor
shepherd
who
pursued
his
calling
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
pentland
hills
amidst
that
pastoral
solitude
the
boy
had
no
opportunity
of
enjoying
the
contemplation
of
works
of
art
it
happened
however
that
in
his
tenth
year
he
was
sent
on
a
message
to
roslin
by
the
farmer
for
whom
his
father
herded
sheep
and
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
castle
and
chapel
there
seems
to
have
made
a
vivid
and
enduring
impression
on
his
mind
probably
to
enable
him
to
indulge
his
love
of
architectural
construction
the
boy
besought
his
father
to
let
him
be
a
joiner
and
he
was
accordingly
put
apprentice
to
a
neighbouring
village
carpenter
having
served
his
time
he
went
to
galashiels
to
seek
work
as
he
was
plodding
along
the
valley
of
the
tweed
with
his
tools
upon
his
back
a
carriage
overtook
him
near
elibank
tower
and
the
coachman
doubtless
at
the
suggestion
of
his
master
who
was
seated
inside
having
asked
the
youth
how
far
he
had
to
walk
and
learning
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
galashiels
invited
him
to
mount
the
box
beside
him
and
thus
to
ride
thither
it
turned
out
that
the
kindly
gentleman
inside
was
no
other
than
sir
walter
scott
then
travelling
on
his
official
duty
as
sheriff
of
selkirkshire
whilst
working
at
galashiels
kemp
had
frequent
opportunities
of
visiting
melrose
dryburgh
and
jedburgh
abbeys
which
he
studied
carefully
inspired
by
his
love
of
architecture
he
worked
his
way
as
a
carpenter
over
the
greater
part
of
the
north
of
england
never
omitting
an
opportunity
of
inspecting
and
making
sketches
of
any
fine
gothic
building
on
one
occasion
when
working
in
lancashire
he
walked
fifty
miles
to
york
spent
a
week
in
carefully
examining
the
minster
and
returned
in
like
manner
on
foot
we
next
find
him
in
glasgow
where
he
remained
four
years
studying
the
fine
cathedral
there
during
his
spare
time
he
returned
to
england
again
this
time
working
his
way
further
south
studying
canterbury
winchester
tintern
and
other
structures
in
he
formed
the
design
of
travelling
over
europe
with
the
same
object
supporting
himself
by
his
trade
reaching
boulogne
he
proceeded
by
abbeville
and
beauvais
to
paris
spending
a
few
weeks
making
drawings
and
studies
at
each
place
his
skill
as
a
mechanic
and
especially
his
knowledge
of
readily
secured
him
employment
wherever
he
went
and
he
usually
chose
the
site
of
his
employment
in
the
neighbourhood
of
some
fine
old
gothic
structure
in
studying
which
he
occupied
his
leisure
after
a
year
s
working
travel
and
study
abroad
he
returned
to
scotland
he
continued
his
studies
and
became
a
proficient
in
drawing
and
perspective
melrose
was
his
favourite
ruin
and
he
produced
several
elaborate
drawings
of
the
building
one
of
which
exhibiting
it
in
a
restored
state
was
afterwards
engraved
he
also
obtained
employment
as
a
modeller
of
architectural
designs
and
made
drawings
for
a
work
begun
by
an
edinburgh
engraver
after
the
plan
of
britton
s
cathedral
this
was
a
task
congenial
to
his
tastes
and
he
laboured
at
it
with
an
enthusiasm
which
ensured
its
rapid
advance
walking
on
foot
for
the
purpose
over
half
scotland
and
living
as
an
ordinary
mechanic
whilst
executing
drawings
which
would
have
done
credit
to
the
best
masters
in
the
art
the
projector
of
the
work
having
died
suddenly
the
publication
was
however
stopped
and
kemp
sought
other
employment
few
knew
of
the
genius
of
this
he
was
exceedingly
taciturn
and
habitually
the
committee
of
the
scott
monument
offered
a
prize
for
the
best
design
the
competitors
were
some
of
the
greatest
names
in
classical
architecture
but
the
design
unanimously
selected
was
that
of
george
kemp
who
was
working
at
kilwinning
abbey
in
ayrshire
many
miles
off
when
the
letter
reached
him
intimating
the
decision
of
the
committee
poor
kemp
shortly
after
this
event
he
met
an
untimely
death
and
did
not
live
to
see
the
first
result
of
his
indefatigable
industry
and
embodied
in
stone
of
the
most
beautiful
and
appropriate
memorials
ever
erected
to
literary
genius
john
gibson
was
another
artist
full
of
a
genuine
enthusiasm
and
love
for
his
art
which
placed
him
high
above
those
sordid
temptations
which
urge
meaner
natures
to
make
time
the
measure
of
profit
he
was
born
at
gyffn
near
conway
in
north
son
of
a
gardener
he
early
showed
indications
of
his
talent
by
the
carvings
in
wood
which
he
made
by
means
of
a
common
pocket
knife
and
his
father
noting
the
direction
of
his
talent
sent
him
to
liverpool
and
bound
him
apprentice
to
a
and
he
rapidly
improved
at
his
trade
and
some
of
his
carvings
were
much
admired
he
was
thus
naturally
led
to
sculpture
and
when
eighteen
years
old
he
modelled
a
small
figure
of
time
in
wax
which
attracted
considerable
notice
the
franceys
sculptors
of
liverpool
having
purchased
the
boy
s
indentures
took
him
as
their
apprentice
for
six
years
during
which
his
genius
displayed
itself
in
many
original
works
from
thence
he
proceeded
to
london
and
afterwards
to
rome
and
his
fame
became
european
robert
thorburn
the
royal
academician
like
john
gibson
was
born
of
poor
parents
his
father
was
a
at
dumfries
besides
robert
there
were
two
other
sons
one
of
whom
is
a
skilful
carver
in
wood
one
day
a
lady
called
at
the
shoemaker
s
and
found
robert
then
a
mere
boy
engaged
in
drawing
upon
a
stool
which
served
him
for
a
table
she
examined
his
work
and
observing
his
abilities
interested
herself
in
obtaining
for
him
some
employment
in
drawing
and
enlisted
in
his
behalf
the
services
of
others
who
could
assist
him
in
prosecuting
the
study
of
art
the
boy
was
diligent
staid
and
silent
mixing
little
with
his
companions
and
forming
but
few
intimacies
about
the
year
some
gentlemen
of
the
town
provided
him
with
the
means
of
proceeding
to
edinburgh
where
he
was
admitted
a
student
at
the
scottish
academy
there
he
had
the
advantage
of
studying
under
competent
masters
and
the
progress
which
he
made
was
rapid
from
edinburgh
he
removed
to
london
where
we
understand
he
had
the
advantage
of
being
introduced
to
notice
under
the
patronage
of
the
duke
of
buccleuch
we
need
scarcely
say
however
that
of
whatever
use
patronage
may
have
been
to
thorburn
in
giving
him
an
introduction
to
the
best
circles
patronage
of
no
kind
could
have
made
him
the
great
artist
that
he
unquestionably
is
without
native
genius
and
diligent
application
noel
paton
the
painter
began
his
artistic
career
at
dunfermline
and
paisley
as
a
drawer
of
patterns
for
and
muslin
embroidered
by
hand
meanwhile
working
diligently
at
higher
subjects
including
the
drawing
of
the
human
figure
he
was
like
turner
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
any
kind
of
work
and
in
when
a
mere
youth
we
find
him
engaged
among
his
other
labours
in
illustrating
the
renfrewshire
he
worked
his
way
step
by
step
slowly
yet
surely
but
he
remained
unknown
until
the
exhibition
of
the
prize
cartoons
painted
for
the
houses
of
parliament
when
his
picture
of
the
spirit
of
religion
for
which
he
obtained
one
of
the
first
prizes
revealed
him
to
the
world
as
a
genuine
artist
and
the
works
which
he
has
since
as
the
reconciliation
of
oberon
and
titania
home
and
the
bluidy
tryste
shown
a
steady
advance
in
artistic
power
and
culture
another
striking
exemplification
of
perseverance
and
industry
in
the
cultivation
of
art
in
humble
life
is
presented
in
the
career
of
james
sharples
a
working
blacksmith
at
blackburn
he
was
born
at
wakefield
in
yorkshire
in
one
of
a
family
of
thirteen
children
his
father
was
a
working
ironfounder
and
removed
to
bury
to
follow
his
business
the
boys
received
no
school
education
but
were
all
sent
to
work
as
soon
as
they
were
able
and
at
about
ten
james
was
placed
in
a
foundry
where
he
was
employed
for
about
two
years
as
after
that
he
was
sent
into
the
where
his
father
worked
as
the
boy
s
employment
was
to
heat
and
carry
rivets
for
the
though
his
hours
of
labour
were
very
from
six
in
the
morning
until
eight
at
father
contrived
to
give
him
some
little
teaching
after
working
hours
and
it
was
thus
that
he
partially
learned
his
letters
an
incident
occurred
in
the
course
of
his
employment
among
the
which
first
awakened
in
him
the
desire
to
learn
drawing
he
had
occasionally
been
employed
by
the
foreman
to
hold
the
chalked
line
with
which
he
made
the
designs
of
boilers
upon
the
floor
of
the
workshop
and
on
such
occasions
the
foreman
was
accustomed
to
hold
the
line
and
direct
the
boy
to
make
the
necessary
dimensions
james
soon
became
so
expert
at
this
as
to
be
of
considerable
service
to
the
foreman
and
at
his
leisure
hours
at
home
his
great
delight
was
to
practise
drawing
designs
of
boilers
upon
his
mother
s
floor
on
one
occasion
when
a
female
relative
was
expected
from
manchester
to
pay
the
family
a
visit
and
the
house
had
been
made
as
decent
as
possible
for
her
reception
the
boy
on
coming
in
from
the
foundry
in
the
evening
began
his
usual
operations
upon
the
floor
he
had
proceeded
some
way
with
his
design
of
a
large
boiler
in
chalk
when
his
mother
arrived
with
the
visitor
and
to
her
dismay
found
the
boy
unwashed
and
the
floor
chalked
all
over
the
relative
however
professed
to
be
pleased
with
the
boy
s
industry
praised
his
design
and
recommended
his
mother
to
provide
the
little
sweep
as
she
called
him
with
paper
and
pencils
encouraged
by
his
elder
brother
he
began
to
practise
figure
and
landscape
drawing
making
copies
of
lithographs
but
as
yet
without
any
knowledge
of
the
rules
of
perspective
and
the
principles
of
light
and
shade
he
worked
on
however
and
gradually
acquired
expertness
in
copying
at
sixteen
he
entered
the
bury
mechanic
s
institution
in
order
to
attend
the
drawing
class
taught
by
an
amateur
who
followed
the
trade
of
a
barber
there
he
had
a
lesson
a
week
during
three
months
the
teacher
recommended
him
to
obtain
from
the
library
burnet
s
practical
treatise
on
painting
but
as
he
could
not
yet
read
with
ease
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
getting
his
mother
and
sometimes
his
elder
brother
to
read
passages
from
the
book
for
him
while
he
sat
by
and
listened
feeling
hampered
by
his
ignorance
of
the
art
of
reading
and
eager
to
master
the
contents
of
burnet
s
book
he
ceased
attending
the
drawing
class
at
the
institute
after
the
first
quarter
and
devoted
himself
to
learning
reading
and
writing
at
home
in
this
he
soon
succeeded
and
when
he
again
entered
the
institute
and
took
out
burnet
a
second
time
he
was
not
only
able
to
read
it
but
to
make
written
extracts
for
further
use
so
ardently
did
he
study
the
volume
that
he
used
to
rise
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
read
it
and
copy
out
passages
after
which
he
went
to
the
foundry
at
six
worked
until
six
and
sometimes
eight
in
the
evening
and
returned
home
to
enter
with
fresh
zest
upon
the
study
of
burnet
which
he
continued
often
until
a
late
hour
parts
of
his
nights
were
also
occupied
in
drawing
and
making
copies
of
drawings
on
one
of
copy
of
leonardo
da
vinci
s
last
supper
spent
an
entire
night
he
went
to
bed
indeed
but
his
mind
was
so
engrossed
with
the
subject
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
rose
again
to
resume
his
pencil
he
next
proceeded
to
try
his
hand
at
painting
in
oil
for
which
purpose
he
procured
some
canvas
from
a
draper
stretched
it
on
a
frame
coated
it
over
with
white
lead
and
began
painting
on
it
with
colours
bought
from
a
but
his
work
proved
a
total
failure
for
the
canvas
was
rough
and
knotty
and
the
paint
would
not
dry
in
his
extremity
he
applied
to
his
old
teacher
the
barber
from
whom
he
first
learnt
that
prepared
canvas
was
to
be
had
and
that
there
were
colours
and
varnishes
made
for
the
special
purpose
of
as
soon
therefore
as
his
means
would
allow
he
bought
a
small
stock
of
the
necessary
articles
and
began
afresh
amateur
master
showing
him
how
to
paint
and
the
pupil
succeeded
so
well
that
he
excelled
the
master
s
copy
his
first
picture
was
a
copy
from
an
engraving
called
and
was
afterwards
sold
by
him
for
aided
by
a
shilling
guide
to
he
went
on
working
at
his
leisure
hours
and
gradually
acquired
a
better
knowledge
of
his
materials
he
made
his
own
easel
and
palette
and
he
bought
his
paint
brushes
and
canvas
as
he
could
raise
the
money
by
working
this
was
the
slender
fund
which
his
parents
consented
to
allow
him
for
the
purpose
the
burden
of
supporting
a
very
large
family
precluding
them
from
doing
more
often
he
would
walk
to
manchester
and
back
in
the
evenings
to
buy
two
or
three
shillings
worth
of
paint
and
canvas
returning
almost
at
midnight
after
his
eighteen
miles
walk
sometimes
wet
through
and
completely
exhausted
but
borne
up
throughout
by
his
inexhaustible
hope
and
invincible
determination
the
further
progress
of
the
artist
is
best
narrated
in
his
own
words
as
communicated
by
him
in
a
letter
to
the
author
the
next
pictures
i
painted
he
says
were
a
landscape
by
moonlight
a
fruitpiece
and
one
or
two
others
after
which
i
conceived
the
idea
of
painting
the
i
had
for
some
time
thought
about
it
but
had
not
attempted
to
embody
the
conception
in
a
drawing
i
now
however
made
a
sketch
of
the
subject
upon
paper
and
then
proceeded
to
paint
it
on
canvas
the
picture
simply
represents
the
interior
of
a
large
workshop
such
as
i
have
been
accustomed
to
work
in
although
not
of
any
particular
shop
it
is
therefore
to
this
extent
an
original
conception
having
made
an
outline
of
the
subject
i
found
that
before
i
could
proceed
with
it
successfully
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
was
indispensable
to
enable
me
accurately
to
delineate
the
muscles
of
the
figures
my
brother
peter
came
to
my
assistance
at
this
juncture
and
kindly
purchased
for
me
flaxman
s
anatomical
studies
work
altogether
beyond
my
means
at
the
time
for
it
cost
shillings
this
book
i
looked
upon
as
a
great
treasure
and
i
studied
it
laboriously
rising
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
draw
after
it
and
occasionally
getting
my
brother
peter
to
stand
for
me
as
a
model
at
that
untimely
hour
although
i
gradually
improved
myself
by
this
practice
it
was
some
time
before
i
felt
sufficient
confidence
to
go
on
with
my
picture
i
also
felt
hampered
by
my
want
of
knowledge
of
perspective
which
i
endeavoured
to
remedy
by
carefully
studying
brook
taylor
s
principles
and
shortly
after
i
resumed
my
painting
while
engaged
in
the
study
of
perspective
at
home
i
used
to
apply
for
and
obtain
leave
to
work
at
the
heavier
kinds
of
smith
work
at
the
foundry
and
for
this
time
required
for
heating
the
heaviest
iron
work
is
so
much
longer
than
that
required
for
heating
the
lighter
that
it
enabled
me
to
secure
a
number
of
spare
minutes
in
the
course
of
the
day
which
i
carefully
employed
in
making
diagrams
in
perspective
upon
the
sheet
iron
casing
in
front
of
the
hearth
at
which
i
thus
assiduously
working
and
studying
james
sharples
steadily
advanced
in
his
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
art
and
acquired
greater
facility
in
its
practice
some
eighteen
months
after
the
expiry
of
his
apprenticeship
he
painted
a
portrait
of
his
father
which
attracted
considerable
notice
in
the
town
as
also
did
the
picture
of
the
forge
which
he
finished
soon
after
his
success
in
obtained
for
him
a
commission
from
the
foreman
of
the
shop
to
paint
a
family
group
and
sharples
executed
it
so
well
that
the
foreman
not
only
paid
him
the
agreed
price
of
eighteen
pounds
but
thirty
shillings
to
boot
while
engaged
on
this
group
he
ceased
to
work
at
the
foundry
and
he
had
thoughts
of
giving
up
his
trade
altogether
and
devoting
himself
exclusively
to
painting
he
proceeded
to
paint
several
pictures
amongst
others
a
head
of
christ
an
original
conception
and
a
view
of
bury
but
not
obtaining
sufficient
employment
at
portraits
to
occupy
his
time
or
give
him
the
prospect
of
a
steady
income
he
had
the
good
sense
to
resume
his
leather
apron
and
go
on
working
at
his
honest
trade
of
a
blacksmith
employing
his
leisure
hours
in
engraving
his
picture
of
the
forge
since
published
he
was
induced
to
commence
the
engraving
by
the
following
circumstance
a
manchester
to
whom
he
showed
the
painting
let
drop
the
observation
that
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
engraver
it
would
make
a
very
good
print
sharples
immediately
conceived
the
idea
of
engraving
it
himself
though
altogether
ignorant
of
the
art
the
difficulties
which
he
encountered
and
successfully
overcame
in
carrying
out
his
project
are
thus
described
by
himself
i
had
seen
an
advertisement
of
a
sheffield
maker
giving
a
list
of
the
prices
at
which
he
supplied
plates
of
various
sizes
and
fixing
upon
one
of
suitable
dimensions
i
remitted
the
amount
together
with
a
small
additional
sum
for
which
i
requested
him
to
send
me
a
few
engraving
tools
i
could
not
specify
the
articles
wanted
for
i
did
not
then
know
anything
about
the
process
of
engraving
however
there
duly
arrived
with
the
plate
three
or
four
gravers
and
an
etching
needle
the
latter
i
spoiled
before
i
knew
its
use
while
working
at
the
plate
the
amalgamated
society
of
engineers
offered
a
premium
for
the
best
design
for
an
emblematical
picture
for
which
i
determined
to
compete
and
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
win
the
prize
shortly
after
this
i
removed
to
blackburn
where
i
obtained
employment
at
yates
engineers
as
an
and
continued
to
employ
my
leisure
time
in
drawing
painting
and
engraving
as
before
with
the
engraving
i
made
but
very
slow
progress
owing
to
the
difficulties
i
experienced
from
not
possessing
proper
tools
i
then
determined
to
try
to
make
some
that
would
suit
my
purpose
and
after
several
failures
i
succeeded
in
making
many
that
i
have
used
in
the
course
of
my
engraving
i
was
also
greatly
at
a
loss
for
want
of
a
proper
magnifying
glass
and
part
of
the
plate
was
executed
with
no
other
assistance
of
this
sort
than
what
my
father
s
spectacles
afforded
though
i
afterwards
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
proper
magnifier
which
was
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
an
incident
occurred
while
i
was
engraving
the
plate
which
had
almost
caused
me
to
abandon
it
altogether
it
sometimes
happened
that
i
was
obliged
to
lay
it
aside
for
a
considerable
time
when
other
work
pressed
and
in
order
to
guard
it
against
rust
i
was
accustomed
to
rub
over
the
graven
parts
with
oil
but
on
examining
the
plate
after
one
of
such
intervals
i
found
that
the
oil
had
become
a
dark
sticky
substance
extremely
difficult
to
get
out
i
tried
to
pick
it
out
with
a
needle
but
found
that
it
would
almost
take
as
much
time
as
to
engrave
the
parts
afresh
i
was
in
great
despair
at
this
but
at
length
hit
upon
the
expedient
of
boiling
it
in
water
containing
soda
and
afterwards
rubbing
the
engraved
parts
with
a
and
to
my
delight
found
the
plan
succeeded
perfectly
my
greatest
difficulties
now
over
patience
and
perseverance
were
all
that
were
needed
to
bring
my
labours
to
a
successful
issue
i
had
neither
advice
nor
assistance
from
any
one
in
finishing
the
plate
if
therefore
the
work
possess
any
merit
i
can
claim
it
as
my
own
and
if
in
its
accomplishment
i
have
contributed
to
show
what
can
be
done
by
persevering
industry
and
determination
it
is
all
the
honour
i
wish
to
lay
claim
it
would
be
beside
our
purpose
to
enter
upon
any
criticism
of
the
forge
as
an
engraving
its
merits
having
been
already
fully
recognised
by
the
art
journals
the
execution
of
the
work
occupied
sharples
s
leisure
evening
hours
during
a
period
of
five
years
and
it
was
only
when
he
took
the
plate
to
the
printer
that
he
for
the
first
time
saw
an
engraved
plate
produced
by
any
other
man
to
this
unvarnished
picture
of
industry
and
genius
we
add
one
other
trait
and
it
is
a
domestic
one
i
have
been
married
seven
years
says
he
and
during
that
time
my
greatest
pleasure
after
i
have
finished
my
daily
labour
at
the
foundry
has
been
to
resume
my
pencil
or
graver
frequently
until
a
late
hour
of
the
evening
my
wife
meanwhile
sitting
by
my
side
and
reading
to
me
from
some
interesting
book
simple
but
beautiful
testimony
to
the
thorough
common
sense
as
well
as
the
genuine
of
this
most
interesting
and
deserving
workman
the
same
industry
and
application
which
we
have
found
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
acquire
excellence
in
painting
and
sculpture
are
equally
required
in
the
sister
art
of
one
being
the
poetry
of
form
and
colour
the
other
of
the
sounds
of
nature
handel
was
an
indefatigable
and
constant
worker
he
was
never
cast
down
by
defeat
but
his
energy
seemed
to
increase
the
more
that
adversity
struck
him
when
a
prey
to
his
mortifications
as
an
insolvent
debtor
he
did
not
give
way
for
a
moment
but
in
one
year
produced
his

twelve
grand

and
the
opera
of

among
the
finest
of
his
works

his
biographer
says
of
him
he
braved
everything
and
by
his
unaided
self
accomplished
the
work
of
twelve

speaking
of
his
art
said
it
consists
in
taking
up
a
subject
and
pursuing
work

the
barriers

say
to

far
and
no
when

john
sebastian
bach
said
of
himself
i
was
industrious
whoever
is
equally
sedulous
will
be
equally
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
bach
was
born
with
a
passion
for
music
which
formed
the
mainspring
of
his
industry
and
was
the
true
secret
of
his
success
when
a
mere
youth
his
elder
brother
wishing
to
turn
his
abilities
in
another
direction
destroyed
a
collection
of
studies
which
the
young
sebastian
being
denied
candles
had
copied
by
moonlight

strong
natural
bent
of

genius

from

talent
but
no
genius
he
lives
solitary
working
fifteen
hours
a
day
at
years
passed
and
meyerbeer

hard
work
fully
brought
out
his
genius
as
displayed
in
his
roberto

prophète
and
other
works
confessedly
amongst
the
greatest
operas
which
have
been
produced
in
modern
times
although
musical
composition
is
not
an
art
in
which
englishmen
have
as
yet
greatly
distinguished
themselves
their
energies
having
for
the
most
part
taken
other
and
more
practical
directions
we
are
not
without
native
illustrations
of

power
of
perseverance
in
this
special
pursuit
arne
was
an
upholsterer
s
son
intended
by
his
father
for
the
legal
profession
but
his
love
of
music
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
be
withheld
from
pursuing
it
while
engaged
in
an
attorney
s
office
his
means
were
very
limited
but
to
gratify
his
tastes
he
was
accustomed
to
borrow
a
livery
and
go
into
the
gallery
of
the
opera
then
appropriated
to
domestics
unknown
to
his
father
he
made
great
progress
with
the
violin
and
the
first
knowledge
his
father
had
of
the
circumstance
was
when
accidentally
calling
at
the
house
of
a
neighbouring
gentleman
to
his
surprise
and
consternation
he
found
his
son
playing
the
leading
instrument
with
a
party
of
musicians
this
incident
decided
the
fate
of
arne
his
father
offered
no
further
opposition
to
his
wishes
and
the
world
thereby
lost
a
lawyer
but
gained
a
musician
of
much
taste
and
delicacy
of
feeling

triumph

miller
at

a
little
town
situated
in
the
valley
of
the
yore
in
the
corner
of
yorkshire
musical
taste
seems
to
have
been
hereditary
in
the
family
for
his
father
played
the
fife
in
the
band
of
the
masham
volunteers
and
was
a
singer
in
the
parish
choir
his
grandfather
also
was
leading
singer
and
ringer
at

church

one
of
the
boy
s
earliest
musical
treats
was
to
be
present
at
the
bell
pealing
on
sunday
mornings
during
the
service
his
wonder
was
still
more
excited
by
the
organist
s
performance
on
the
the
doors
of
which
were
thrown
open
behind
to
let
the
sound
fully
into
the
church
by
which
the
stops
pipes
barrels
staples
keyboard
and
jacks
were
fully
exposed
to
the
wonderment
of
the
little
boys
sitting
in
the
gallery
behind
and
to
none
more
than
our
young
musician
at
eight
years
of
age
he
began
to
play
upon
his
father
s
old
fife
which
however
would
not
sound
d
but
his
mother
remedied
the
difficulty
by
buying
for
him
a
flute
and
shortly
after
a
gentleman
of
the
neighbourhood
presented
him
with
a
flute
with
four
silver
keys
as
the

made
no
progress
with
his
book
learning
being
fonder
of
cricket

and
boxing
than
of
his
school

schoolmaster
giving
him
up
as
a
bad
job
parents
sent
him
off
to
a
school
at
pateley
bridge
while
there
he
found
congenial
society
in
a
club
of
village
choral
singers
at
brighouse
gate
and
with
them
he
learnt
the
gamut
on
the
old
english
plan
he
was
thus
well
drilled
in
the
reading
of
music
in
which
he
soon
became
a
proficient
his
progress
astonished
the
club
and
he
returned
home
full
of
musical
ambition
he
now
learnt
to
play
upon
his
father
s
old
piano
but
with
little
melodious
result
and
he
became
eager
to
possess
a
but
had
no
means
of
procuring
one
about
this
time
a
neighbouring
parish
clerk
had
purchased
for
an
insignificant
sum
a
small

had
gone
the
circuit
of
the
northern
counties
with
a
show
the
clerk
tried
to
revive
the
tones
of
the
instrument
but
failed
at
last
he
bethought
him
that
he
would
try
the
skill
of
young
jackson
who
had
succeeded
in
making
some
alterations
and
improvements
in
the
of
the
parish
church
he
accordingly
brought
it
to
the
lad
s
house
in
a
donkey
cart
and
in
a
short
time
the
instrument
was
repaired
and
played
over
its
old
tunes
again
greatly
to
the
owner
s
satisfaction
the
thought
now
haunted
the
youth
that
he
could
make
a
and
he
determined
to
do
so
his
father
and
he
set
to
work
and
though
without
practice
in
carpentering
yet
by
dint
of
hard
labour
and
after
many
failures
they
at
last
succeeded
and
an
organ
was
constructed
which
played
ten
tunes
very
decently
and
the
instrument
was
generally
regarded
as
a
marvel
in
the
neighbourhood
young
jackson
was
now
frequently
sent
for
to
repair
old
church
organs
and
to
put
new
music
upon
the
barrels
which
he
added
to
them
all
this
he
accomplished
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
employers
after
which
he
proceeded
with
the
construction
of
a
adapting
to
it
the
keys
of
an
old
harpsichord
this
he
learnt
to
play
upon
callcott
s
thorough
bass
in
the
evening
and
working
at
his
trade
of
a
miller
during
the
day
occasionally
also
tramping
about
the
country
as
a
cadger
with
an
ass
and
a
cart
during
summer
he
worked
in
the
fields
at
and
harvest
but
was
never
without
the
solace
of
music
in
his
leisure
evening
hours
he
next
tried
his
hand
at
musical
composition
and
twelve
of
his
anthems
were
shown
to
the
late
camidge
of
york
as
the
production
of
a
miller
s
lad
of
camidge
was
pleased
with
them
marked
the
objectionable
passages
and
returned
them
with
the
encouraging
remark
that
they
did
the
youth
great
credit
and
that
he
must
go
on
a
village
band
having
been
set
on
foot
at
masham
young
jackson
joined
it
and
was
ultimately
appointed
leader
he
played
all
the
instruments
by
turns
and
thus
acquired
a
considerable
practical
knowledge
of
his
art
he
also
composed
numerous
tunes
for
the
band
a
new
having
been
presented
to
the
parish
church
he
was
appointed
the
organist
he
now
gave
up
his
employment
as
a
journeyman
miller
and
commenced
still
employing
his
spare
hours
in
the
study
of
music
in
he
published
his
first
for
joy
let
fertile
valleys
sing
and
in
the
following
year
he
gained
the
first
prize
from
the
huddersfield
glee
club
for
his
sisters
of
the
his
other
anthem
god
be
merciful
to
us
and
the
psalm
written
for
a
double
chorus
and
orchestra
are
well
known
in
the
midst
of
these
minor
works
jackson
proceeded
with
the
composition
of
his
oratorio
the
deliverance
of
israel
from
his
practice
was
to
jot
down
a
sketch
of
the
ideas
as
they
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
and
to
write
them
out
in
score
in
the
evenings
after
he
had
left
his
work
in
the
his
oratorio
was
published
in
parts
in
the
course
of
and
he
published
the
last
chorus
on
his
birthday
the
work
was
exceedingly
well
received
and
has
been
frequently
performed
with
much
success
in
the
northern
towns
jackson
eventually
settled
as
a
professor
of
music
at
bradford
where
he
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
the
cultivation
of
the
musical
taste
of
that
town
and
its
neighbourhood
some
years
since
he
had
the
honour
of
leading
his
fine
company
of
bradford
choral
singers
before
her
majesty
at
buckingham
palace
on
which
occasion
as
well
as
at
the
crystal
palace
some
choral
pieces
of
his
composition
were
performed
with
great
effect
such
is
a
brief
outline
of
the
career
of
a
musician
whose
life
affords
but
another
illustration
of
the
power
of
and
the
force
of
courage
and
industry
in
enabling
a
man
to
surmount
and
overcome
early
difficulties
and
obstructions
of
no
ordinary
kind
chapter
vii
industry
and
the
peerage
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
deserts
are
small
that
dares
not
put
it
to
the
touch
to
gain
or
lose
it
of
he
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seats
and
exalted
them
of
low
we
have
already
referred
to
some
illustrious
commoners
raised
from
humble
to
elevated
positions
by
the
power
of
application
and
industry
and
we
might
point
to
even
the
peerage
itself
as
affording
equally
instructive
examples
one
reason
why
the
peerage
of
england
has
succeeded
so
well
in
holding
its
own
arises
from
the
fact
that
unlike
the
peerages
of
other
countries
it
has
been
fed
from
time
to
time
by
the
best
industrial
blood
of
the
very
liver
heart
and
brain
of
like
the
fabled
antæus
it
has
been
invigorated
and
refreshed
by
touching
its
mother
earth
and
mingling
with
that
most
ancient
order
of
working
order
the
blood
of
all
men
flows
from
equally
remote
sources
and
though
some
are
unable
to
trace
their
line
directly
beyond
their
grandfathers
all
are
nevertheless
justified
in
placing
at
the
head
of
their
pedigree
the
great
progenitors
of
the
race
as
lord
chesterfield
did
when
he
wrote
adam
no
class
is
ever
long
stationary
the
mighty
fall
and
the
humble
are
exalted
new
families
take
the
place
of
the
old
who
disappear
among
the
ranks
of
the
common
people
burke
s
vicissitudes
of
families
strikingly
exhibit
this
rise
and
fall
of
families
and
show
that
the
misfortunes
which
overtake
the
rich
and
noble
are
greater
in
proportion
than
those
which
overwhelm
the
poor
this
author
points
out
that
of
the
barons
selected
to
enforce
the
observance
of
magna
charta
there
is
not
now
in

house
of

a
single
male
descendant
civil
wars
and
rebellions
ruined
many
of
the
old
nobility
and
dispersed
their
families
yet
their
descendants
in
many
cases
survive
and
are
to
be
found
among
the
ranks
of
the
people
fuller
wrote
in
his
worthies
that
some
who
justly
hold
the
surnames
of
bohuns
mortimers
and
plantagenets
are
hid
in
the
heap
of

thus
burke
shows
that
two
of
the
lineal
descendants
of
the
earl
of
kent
sixth
son
of
edward
were
discovered
in
a
butcher
and

and
that
among
the
lineal
descendants
of
the
duke
of
gloucester
son
of
edward
was
the
late
sexton
of

it
is
understood
that
the
lineal
descendant
of

is
a
saddler
in

one
of
the
descendants
of
the
proud

a
claimant
of
the
title
of
duke
of
northumberland
was
a
dublin
and
not
many
years
since
one
of
the
claimants
for
the
title
of
earl
of
perth
presented
himself
in
the
person
of
a
labourer
in
a
northumberland
hugh
miller
when
working
as
a
near
edinburgh
was
served
by
a

was

of
the
numerous
claimants
for
the
earldom

establish

poverty
many
barons
of
proud
names

have
perished
like

upon

tree
after
eating
up
all
the
leaves

others
have
been
overtaken
by
adversities
which
they
have
been
unable
to
retrieve
and
sunk
at
last
into
poverty
and
obscurity
such
are
the
mutabilities
of
rank
and
fortune
the
great
bulk
of
our
peerage
is
comparatively
modern
so
far
as
the
titles
go
but
it
is
not
the
less
noble
that
it
has
been
recruited
to
so
large
an
extent
from
the
ranks
of
honourable
industry
in
olden
times
the
wealth
and
commerce
of
london
conducted
as
it
was
by
energetic
and
enterprising
men
was
a
prolific
source
of
peerages
thus
the
earldom
of
cornwallis
was
founded
by
thomas
cornwallis
the
cheapside
merchant
that
of
essex
by
william
capel
the
draper
and
that
of
craven
by

the
merchant
tailor
the
modern
earl
of
warwick
is
not
descended
from
the
but
from
william

the
woolstapler
whilst
the
modern
dukes
of
northumberland
find
their
head
not
in
the
percies
but
in
hugh
smithson
a
respectable
london
apothecary
the
founders
of
the
families

dartmouth
radnor

were

a

darnley

and

the
founders
of
the
houses
of
foley
and
normanby
were
remarkable
men
in
many
respects
and
as
furnishing
striking
examples
of
energy
of
character
the
story
of
their
lives
is
worthy
of
preservation
the
father
of
richard
foley
the
founder
of
the
family
was
a
small
yeoman
living
in
the
neighbourhood
of
stourbridge
in
the
time
of
charles
i
that
place
was
then
the
centre
of
the
iron
manufacture
of
the
midland
districts
and
richard
was
brought
up
to
work
at
one
of
the
branches
of
the
of
he
was
thus
a
daily
observer
of
the
great
labour
and
loss
of
time
caused
by
the
clumsy
process
then
adopted
for
dividing
the
rods
of
iron
in
the
manufacture
of
nails
it
appeared
that
the
stourbridge
nailers
were
gradually
losing
their
trade
in
consequence
of
the
importation
of
nails
from
sweden
by
which
they
were
undersold
in
the
market
it
became
known
that
the
swedes
were
enabled
to
make
their
nails
so
much
cheaper
by
the
use
of
splitting
mills
and
machinery
which
had
completely
superseded
the
laborious
process
of
preparing
the
rods
for
then
practised
in
england
richard
foley
having
ascertained
this
much
determined
to
make
himself
master
of
the
new
process
he
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
neighbourhood
of
stourbridge
and
was
not
heard
of
for
several
years
no
one
knew
whither
he
had
gone
not
even
his
own
family
for
he
had
not
informed
them
of
his
intention
lest
he
should
fail
he
had
little
or
no
money
in
his
pocket
but
contrived
to
get
to
hull
where
he
engaged
himself
on
board
a
ship
bound
for
a
swedish
port
and
worked
his
passage
there
the
only
article
of
property
which
he
possessed
was
his
fiddle
and
on
landing
in
sweden
he
begged
and
fiddled
his
way
to
the
dannemora
mines
near
upsala
he
was
a
capital
musician
as
well
as
a
pleasant
fellow
and
soon
ingratiated
himself
with
the
he
was
received
into
the
works
to
every
part
of
which
he
had
access
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
him
of
storing
his
mind
with
observations
and
mastering
as
he
thought
the
mechanism
of
iron
splitting
after
a
continued
stay
for
this
purpose
he
suddenly
disappeared
from
amongst
his
kind
friends
the
one
knew
whither
returned
to
england
he
communicated
the
results
of
his
voyage
to
knight
and
another
person
at
stourbridge
who
had
sufficient
confidence
in
him
to
advance
the
requisite
funds
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
buildings
and
machinery
for
splitting
iron
by
the
new
process
but
when
set
to
work
to
the
great
vexation
and
disappointment
of
all
and
especially
of
richard
foley
it
was
found
that
the
machinery
would
not
all
events
it
would
not
split
the
bars
of
iron
again
foley
disappeared
it
was
thought
that
shame
and
mortification
at
his
failure
had
driven
him
away
for
ever
not
so
foley
had
determined
to
master
this
secret
of
and
he
would
yet
do
it
he
had
again
set
out
for
sweden
accompanied
by
his
fiddle
as
before
and
found
his
way
to
the
iron
works
where
he
was
joyfully
welcomed
by
the
miners
and
to
make
sure
of
their
fiddler
they
this
time
lodged
him
in
the
very
itself
there
was
such
an
apparent
absence
of
intelligence
about
the
man
except
in
that
the
miners
entertained
no
suspicions
as
to
the
object
of
their
minstrel
whom
they
thus
enabled
to
attain
the
very
end
and
aim
of
his
life
he
now
carefully
examined
the
works
and
soon
discovered
the
cause
of
his
failure
he
made
drawings
or
tracings
of
the
machinery
as
well
as
he
could
though
this
was
a
branch
of
art
quite
new
to
him
and
after
remaining
at
the
place
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
verify
his
observations
and
to
impress
the
mechanical
arrangements
clearly
and
vividly
on
his
mind
he
again
left
the
miners
reached
a
swedish
port
and
took
ship
for
england
a
man
of
such
purpose
could
not
but
succeed
arrived
amongst
his
surprised
friends
he
now
completed
his
arrangements
and
the
results
were
entirely
successful
by
his
skill
and
his
industry
he
soon
laid
the
foundations
of
a
large
fortune
at
the
same
time
that
he
restored
the
business
of
an
extensive
district
he
himself
continued
during
his
life
to
carry
on
his
trade
aiding
and
encouraging
all
works
of
benevolence
in
his
neighbourhood
he
founded
and
endowed
a
school
at
stourbridge
and
his
son
thomas
a
great
benefactor
of
kidderminster
who
was
high
sheriff
of
worcestershire
in
the
time
of
the
rump
founded
and
endowed
an
hospital
still
in
existence
for
the
free
education
of
children
at
old
swinford
all
the
early
foleys
were
puritans
richard
baxter
seems
to
have
been
on
familiar
and
intimate
terms
with
various
members
of
the
family
and
makes
frequent
mention
of
them
in
his
life
and
thomas
foley
when
appointed
high
sheriff
of
the
county
requested
baxter
to
preach
the
customary
sermon
before
him
and
baxter
in
his
life
speaks
of
him
as
of
so
just
and
blameless
dealing
that
all
men
he
ever
had
to
do
with
magnified
his
great
integrity
and
honesty
which
were
questioned
by
the
family
was
ennobled
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
second
william
phipps
the
founder
of
the
mulgrave
or
normanby
family
was
a
man
quite
as
remarkable
in
his
way
as
richard
foley
his
father
was
a
robust
englishman
settled
at
woolwich
in
maine
then
forming
part
of
our
english
colonies
in
america
he
was
born
in
one
of
a
family
of
not
fewer
than
children
of
whom
were
sons
whose
only
fortune
lay
in
their
stout
hearts
and
strong
arms
william
seems
to
have
had
a
dash
of
the
blood
in
his
veins
and
did
not
take
kindly
to
the
quiet
life
of
a
shepherd
in
which
he
spent
his
early
years
by
nature
bold
and
adventurous
he
longed
to
become
a
sailor
and
roam
through
the
world
he
sought
to
join
some
ship
but
not
being
able
to
find
one
he
apprenticed
himself
to
a
shipbuilder
with
whom
he
thoroughly
learnt
his
trade
acquiring
the
arts
of
reading
and
writing
during
his
leisure
hours
having
completed
his
apprenticeship
and
removed
to
boston
he
wooed
and
married
a
widow
of
some
means
after
which
he
set
up
a
little
shipbuilding
yard
of
his
own
built
a
ship
and
putting
to
sea
in
her
he
engaged
in
the
lumber
trade
which
he
carried
on
in
a
plodding
and
laborious
way
for
the
space
of
about
ten
years
it
happened
that
one
day
whilst
passing
through
the
crooked
streets
of
old
boston
he
overheard
some
sailors
talking
to
each
other
of
a
wreck
which
had
just
taken
place
off
the
bahamas
that
of
a
spanish
ship
supposed
to
have
much
money
on
board
his
adventurous
spirit
was
at
once
kindled
and
getting
together
a
likely
crew
without
loss
of
time
he
set
sail
for
the
bahamas
the
wreck
being
well
he
easily
found
it
and
succeeded
in
recovering
a
great
deal
of
its
cargo
but
very
little
money
and
the
result
was
that
he
barely
defrayed
his
expenses
his
success
had
been
such
however
as
to
stimulate
his
enterprising
spirit
and
when
he
was
told
of
another
and
far
more
richly
laden
vessel
which
had
been
wrecked
near
port
de
la
plata
more
than
half
a
century
before
he
forthwith
formed
the
resolution
of
raising
the
wreck
or
at
all
events
of
fishing
up
the
treasure
being
too
poor
however
to
undertake
such
an
enterprise
without
powerful
help
he
set
sail
for
england
in
the
hope
that
he
might
there
obtain
it
the
fame
of
his
success
in
raising
the
wreck
off
the
bahamas
had
already
preceded
him
he
applied
direct
to
the
government
by
his
urgent
enthusiasm
he
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
usual
inertia
of
official
minds
and
charles
ii
eventually
placed
at
his
disposal
the
rose
algier
a
ship
of
eighteen
guns
and
men
appointing
him
to
the
chief
command
phipps
then
set
sail
to
find
the
spanish
ship
and
fish
up
the
treasure
he
reached
the
coast
of
hispaniola
in
safety
but
how
to
find
the
sunken
ship
was
the
great
difficulty
the
fact
of
the
wreck
was
more
than
fifty
years
old
and
phipps
had
only
the
traditionary
rumours
of
the
event
to
work
upon
there
was
a
wide
coast
to
explore
and
an
outspread
ocean
without
any
trace
whatever
of
the
argosy
which
lay
somewhere
at
its
bottom
but
the
man
was
stout
in
heart
and
full
of
hope
he
set
his
seamen
to
work
to
drag
along
the
coast
and
for
weeks
they
went
on
fishing
up
shingle
and
bits
of
rock
no
occupation
could
be
more
trying
to
seamen
and
they
began
to
grumble
one
to
another
and
to
whisper
that
the
man
in
command
had
brought
them
on
a
fool
s
errand
at
length
the
murmurers
gained
head
and
the
men
broke
into
open
mutiny
a
body
of
them
rushed
one
day
on
to
the
and
demanded
that
the
voyage
should
be
relinquished
phipps
however
was
not
a
man
to
be
intimidated
he
seized
the
ringleaders
and
sent
the
others
back
to
their
duty
it
became
necessary
to
bring
the
ship
to
anchor
close
to
a
small
island
for
the
purpose
of
repairs
and
to
lighten
her
the
chief
part
of
the
stores
was
landed
discontent
still
increasing
amongst
the
crew
a
new
plot
was
laid
amongst
the
men
on
shore
to
seize
the
ship
throw
phipps
overboard
and
start
on
a
piratical
cruize
against
the
spaniards
in
the
south
seas
but
it
was
necessary
to
secure
the
services
of
the
chief
ship
carpenter
who
was
consequently
made
privy
to
the
pilot
this
man
proved
faithful
and
at
once
told
the
captain
of
his
danger
summoning
about
him
those
whom
he
knew
to
be
loyal
phipps
had
the
ship
s
guns
loaded
which
commanded
the
shore
and
ordered
the
bridge
communicating
with
the
vessel
to
be
drawn
up
when
the
mutineers
made
their
appearance
the
captain
hailed
them
and
told
the
men
he
would
fire
upon
them
if
they
approached
the
stores
still
on
land
they
drew
back
on
which
phipps
had
the
stores
reshipped
under
cover
of
his
guns
the
mutineers
fearful
of
being
left
upon
the
barren
island
threw
down
their
arms
and
implored
to
be
permitted
to
return
to
their
duty
the
request
was
granted
and
suitable
precautions
were
taken
against
future
mischief
phipps
however
took
the
first
opportunity
of
landing
the
mutinous
part
of
the
crew
and
engaging
other
men
in
their
places
but
by
the
time
that
he
could
again
proceed
actively
with
his
explorations
he
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
proceed
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
repairing
the
ship
he
had
now
however
gained
more
precise
information
as
to
the
spot
where
the
spanish
treasure
ship
had
sunk
and
though
as
yet
baffled
he
was
more
confident
than
ever
of
the
eventual
success
of
his
enterprise
returned
to
london
phipps
reported
the
result
of
his
voyage
to
the
admiralty
who
professed
to
be
pleased
with
his
exertions
but
he
had
been
unsuccessful
and
they
would
not
entrust
him
with
another
king
s
ship
james
ii
was
now
on
the
throne
and
the
government
was
in
trouble
so
phipps
and
his
golden
project
appealed
to
them
in
vain
he
next
tried
to
raise
the
requisite
means
by
a
public
subscription
at
first
he
was
laughed
at
but
his
ceaseless
importunity
at
length
prevailed
and
after
four
years
dinning
of
his
project
into
the
ears
of
the
great
and
which
time
he
lived
in
at
length
succeeded
a
company
was
formed
in
twenty
shares
the
duke
of
albermarle
son
of
general
monk
taking
the
chief
interest
in
it
and
subscribing
the
principal
part
of
the
necessary
fund
for
the
prosecution
of
the
enterprise
like
foley
phipps
proved
more
fortunate
in
his
second
voyage
than
in
his
first
the
ship
arrived
without
accident
at
port
de
la
plata
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
reef
of
rocks
supposed
to
have
been
the
scene
of
the
wreck
his
first
object
was
to
build
a
stout
boat
capable
of
carrying
eight
or
ten
oars
in
constructing
which
phipps
used
the
adze
himself
it
is
also
said
that
he
constructed
a
machine
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
bottom
of
the
sea
similar
to
what
is
now
known
as
the
diving
bell
such
a
machine
was
found
referred
to
in
books
but
phipps
knew
little
of
books
and
may
be
said
to
have
the
apparatus
for
his
own
use
he
also
engaged
indian
divers
whose
feats
of
diving
for
pearls
and
in
submarine
operations
were
very
remarkable
the
tender
and
boat
having
been
taken
to
the
reef
the
men
were
set
to
work
the
diving
bell
was
sunk
and
the
various
modes
of
dragging
the
bottom
of
the
sea
were
employed
continuously
for
many
weeks
but
without
any
prospect
of
success
phipps
however
held
on
valiantly
hoping
almost
against
hope
at
length
one
day
a
sailor
looking
over
the
boat
s
side
down
into
the
clear
water
observed
a
curious
growing
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
crevice
of
the
rock
and
he
called
upon
an
indian
diver
to
go
down
and
fetch
it
for
him
on
the
red
man
coming
up
with
the
weed
he
reported
that
a
number
of
ships
guns
were
lying
in
the
same
place
the
intelligence
was
at
first
received
with
incredulity
but
on
further
investigation
it
proved
to
be
correct
search
was
made
and
presently
a
diver
came
up
with
a
solid
bar
of
silver
in
his
arms
when
phipps
was
shown
it
he
exclaimed
thanks
be
to
god
we
are
all
made
diving
bell
and
divers
now
went
to
work
with
a
will
and
in
a
few
days
treasure
was
brought
up
to
the
value
of
about
with
which
phipps
set
sail
for
england
on
his
arrival
it
was
urged
upon
the
king
that
he
should
seize
the
ship
and
its
cargo
under
the
pretence
that
phipps
when
soliciting
his
majesty
s
permission
had
not
given
accurate
information
respecting
the
business
but
the
king
replied
that
he
knew
phipps
to
be
an
honest
man
and
that
he
and
his
friends
should
divide
the
whole
treasure
amongst
them
even
though
he
had
returned
with
double
the
value
phipps
s
share
was
about
and
the
king
to
show
his
approval
of
his
energy
and
honesty
in
conducting
the
enterprise
conferred
upon
him
the
honour
of
knighthood
he
was
also
made
high
sheriff
of
new
england
and
during
the
time
he
held
the
office
he
did
valiant
service
for
the
mother
country
and
the
colonists
against
the
french
by
expeditions
against
port
royal
and
quebec
he
also
held
the
post
of
governor
of
massachusetts
from
which
he
returned
to
england
and
died
in
london
in
phipps
throughout
the
latter
part
of
his
career
was
not
ashamed
to
allude
to
the
lowness
of
his
origin
and
it
was
matter
of
honest
pride
to
him
that
he
had
risen
from
the
condition
of
common
ship
carpenter
to
the
honours
of
knighthood
and
the
government
of
a
province
when
perplexed
with
public
business
he
would
often
declare
that
it
would
be
easier
for
him
to
go
back
to
his
broad
axe
again
he
left
behind
him
a
character
for
probity
honesty
patriotism
and
courage
which
is
certainly
not
the
least
noble
inheritance
of
the
house
of
normanby
william
petty
the
founder
of
the
house
of
lansdowne
was
a
man
of
like
energy
and
public
usefulness
in
his
day
he
was
the
son
of
a
clothier
in
humble
circumstances
at
romsey
in
hampshire
where
he
was
born
in
in
his
boyhood
he
obtained
a
tolerable
education
at
the
grammar
school
of
his
native
town
after
which
he
determined
to
improve
himself
by
study
at
the
university
of
caen
in
normandy
whilst
there
he
contrived
to
support
himself
unassisted
by
his
father
carrying
on
a
sort
of
small
pedler
s
trade
with
a
little
stock
of
returning
to
england
he
had
himself
bound
apprentice
to
a
sea
captain
who
drubbed
him
with
a
rope
s
end
for
the
badness
of
his
sight
he
left
the
navy
in
disgust
taking
to
the
study
of
medicine
when
at
paris
he
engaged
in
dissection
during
which
time
he
also
drew
diagrams
for
hobbes
who
was
then
writing
his
treatise
on
optics
he
was
reduced
to
such
poverty
that
he
subsisted
for
two
or
three
weeks
entirely
on
walnuts
but
again
he
began
to
trade
in
a
small
way
turning
an
honest
penny
and
he
was
enabled
shortly
to
return
to
england
with
money
in
his
pocket
being
of
an
ingenious
mechanical
turn
we
find
him
taking
out
a
patent
for
a
machine
he
began
to
write
upon
the
arts
and
sciences
and
practised
chemistry
and
physic
with
such
success
that
his
reputation
shortly
became
considerable
associating
with
men
of
science
the
project
of
forming
a
society
for
its
prosecution
was
discussed
and
the
first
meetings
of
the
infant
royal
society
were
held
at
his
lodgings
at
oxford
he
acted
for
a
time
as
deputy
to
the
anatomical
professor
there
who
had
a
great
repugnance
to
dissection
in
his
industry
was
rewarded
by
the
appointment
of
physician
to
the
army
in
ireland
whither
he
went
and
whilst
there
he
was
the
medical
attendant

that
the
lands
were
very
inaccurately
measured
and
in
the
midst
of
his
many
avocations
he
undertook
to
do
the
work
himself
his
appointments
became
so
numerous
and
lucrative
that
he
was
charged
by
the
envious
with
corruption
and
removed
from
them
all
but
he
was
again
taken
into
favour
at
the
restoration

a
most
indefatigable
contriver
inventor

one
of
his
inventions

our
own
day
is
that
of
strutt
of
belper
their
patent
of
nobility
was
virtually
secured
by
jedediah
strutt
in
when
he
invented
his
machine
for
making
ribbed
stockings
and
thereby
laid
the
foundations
of
a
fortune
which
the
subsequent
bearers
of
the
name
have
largely
increased
and
nobly
employed
the
father
of
jedediah
was
a
farmer
and
malster
who
did
but
little
for
the
education
of
his
children
yet
they
all
prospered
jedediah
was
the
second
son
and
when
a
boy
assisted
his
father
in
the
work
of
the
farm
at
an
early
age
he
exhibited
a
taste
for
mechanics
and
introduced
several
improvements
in
the
rude
agricultural
implements
of
the
period
on
the
death
of
his
uncle
he
succeeded
to
a
farm
at
blackwall
near
normanton
long
in
the
tenancy
of
the
family
and
shortly
after
he
married
miss
wollatt
the
daughter
of
a
derby
hosier
having
learned
from
his
wife
s
brother
that
various
unsuccessful
attempts
had
been
made
to
manufacture
he
proceeded
to
study
the
subject
with
a
view
to
effect
what
others
had
failed
in
accomplishing
he
accordingly
obtained
a
and
after
mastering
its
construction
and
mode
of
action
he
proceeded
to
introduce
new
combinations
by
means
of
which
he
succeeded
in
effecting
a
variation
in
the
plain
of
the
frame
and
was
thereby
enabled
to
turn
out
ribbed
hosiery
having
secured
a
patent
for
the
improved
machine
he
removed
to
derby
and
there
entered
largely
on
the
manufacture
of
in
which
he
was
very
successful
he
afterwards
joined
arkwright
of
the
merits
of
whose
invention
he
fully
satisfied
himself
and
found
the
means
of
securing
his
patent
as
well
as
erecting
a
large
at
cranford
in
derbyshire
after
the
expiry
of
the
partnership
with
arkwright
the
strutts
erected
extensive
at
milford
near
belper
which
worthily
gives
its
title
to
the
present
head
of
the
family
the
sons
of
the
founder
were
like
their
father
distinguished
for
their
mechanical
ability
thus
william
strutt
the
eldest
is
said
to
have
invented
a
mule
the
success
of
which
was
only
prevented
by
the
mechanical
skill
of
that
day
being
unequal
to
its
manufacture
edward
the
son
of
william
was
a
man
of
eminent
mechanical
genius
having
early
discovered
the
principle
of
for
carriages
he
had
a
wheelbarrow
and
two
carts
made
on
the
principle
which
were
used
on
his
farm
near
belper
it
may
be
added
that
the
strutts
have
throughout
been
distinguished
for
their
noble
employment
of
the
wealth
which
their
industry
and
skill
have
brought
them
that
they
have
sought
in
all
ways
to
improve
the
moral
and
social
condition
of
the
in
their
employment
and
that
they
have
been
liberal
donors
in
every
good
which
the
presentation
by
joseph
strutt
of
the
beautiful
park
or
arboretum
at
derby
as
a
gift
to
the
townspeople
for
ever
affords
only
one
of
many
illustrations
the
concluding
words
of
the
short
address
which
he
delivered
on
presenting
this
valuable
gift
are
worthy
of
being
quoted
and
remembered
as
the
sun
has
shone
brightly
on
me
through
life
it
would
be
ungrateful
in
me
not
to
employ
a
portion
of
the
fortune
i
possess
in
promoting
the
welfare
of
those
amongst
whom
i
live
and
by
whose
industry
i
have
been
aided
in
its
no
less
industry
and
energy
have
been
displayed
by
the
many
brave
men
both
in
present
and
past
times
who
have
earned
the
peerage
by
their
valour
on
land
and
at
sea
not
to
mention
the
older
feudal
lords
whose
tenure
depended
upon
military
service
and
who
so
often
led
the
van
of
the
english
armies
in
great
national
encounters
we
may
point
to
nelson
vincent
and
wellington
hill
hardinge
clyde
and
many
more
in
recent
times
who
have
nobly
earned
their
rank
by
their
distinguished
services
but
plodding
industry
has
far
oftener
worked
its
way
to
the
peerage
by
the
honourable
pursuit
of
the
legal
profession
than
by
any
other
no
fewer
than
seventy
british
peerages
including
two
dukedoms
have
been
founded
by
successful
lawyers
mansfield
and
erskine
were
it
is
true
of
noble
family
but
the
latter
used
to
thank
god
that
out
of
his
own
family
he
did
not
know
a
lord
the
others
were
for
the
most
part
the
sons
of
attorneys
grocers
clergymen
merchants
and
hardworking
members
of
the
middle
class
out
of
this
profession
have
sprung
the
peerages
of
howard
and
cavendish
the
first
peers
of
both
families
having
been
judges
those
of
aylesford
ellenborough

and

and
chelmsford
lord

father
was
a

painter
and
that
of
leonards
a
perfumer
and
hairdresser
in
burlington
street
young
edward
sugden
was
originally
an
in
the
office
of
the
late
groom
of
henrietta
street
cavendish
square
a
certificated
conveyancer
and
it
was
there
that
the
future
lord
chancellor
of
ireland
obtained
his
first
notions
of
law
the
origin
of
the
late
lord
tenterden
was
perhaps
the
humblest
of
all
nor
was
he
ashamed
of
it
for
he
felt
that
the
industry
study
and
application
by
means
of
which
he
achieved
his
eminent
position
were
entirely
due
to
himself
it
is
related
of
him
that
on
one
occasion
he
took
his
son
charles
to
a
little
shed
then
standing
opposite
the
western
front
of
canterbury
cathedral
and
pointing
it
out
to
him
said
charles
you
see
this
little
shop
i
have
brought
you
here
on
purpose
to
show
it
you
in
that
shop
your
grandfather
used
to
shave
for
a
penny
that
is
the
proudest
reflection
of
my
when
a
boy
lord
tenterden
was
a
singer
in
the
cathedral
and
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
that
his
destination
in
life
was
changed
by
a
disappointment
when
he
and
justice
richards
were
going
the
home
circuit
together
they
went
to
service
in
the
cathedral
and
on
richards
commending
the
voice
of
a
singing
man
in
the
choir
lord
tenterden
said
ah
that
is
the
only
man
i
ever
envied
when
at
school
in
this
town
we
were
candidates
for
a
chorister
s
place
and
he
obtained
not
less
remarkable
was
the
rise
to
the
same
distinguished
office
of
lord
chief
justice
of
the
rugged
kenyon
and
the
robust
ellenborough
nor
was
he
a
less
notable
man
who
recently
held
the
same
astute
lord
campbell
late
lord
chancellor
of
england
son
of
a
parish
minister
in
fifeshire
for
many
years
he
worked
hard
as
a
reporter
for
the
press
while
diligently
preparing
himself
for
the
practice
of
his
profession
it
is
said
of
him
that
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
he
was
accustomed
to
walk
from
county
town
to
county
town
when
on
circuit
being
as
yet
too
poor
to
afford
the
luxury
of
posting
but
step
by
step
he
rose
slowly
but
surely
to
that
eminence
and
distinction
which
ever
follow
a
career
of
industry
honourably
and
energetically
pursued
in
the
legal
as
in
every
other
profession
there
have
been
other
illustrious
instances
of
lords
chancellors
who
have
plodded
up
the
steep
of
fame
and
honour
with
equal
energy
and
success
the
career
of
the
late
lord
eldon
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
remarkable
examples
he
was
the
son
of
a
newcastle
a
mischievous
rather
than
a
studious
boy
a
great
scapegrace
at
school
and
the
subject
of
many
terrible
thrashings
was
one
of
the
favourite
exploits
of
the
future
lord
chancellor
his
father
first
thought
of
putting
him
apprentice
to
a
grocer
and
afterwards
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
bring
him
up
to
his
own
trade
of
a
but
by
this
time
his
eldest
son
william
afterwards
lord
stowell
who
had
gained
a
scholarship
at
oxford
wrote
to
his
father
send
jack
up
to
me
i
can
do
better
for
john
was
sent
up
to
oxford
accordingly
where
by
his
brother
s
influence
and
his
own
application
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
fellowship
but
when
at
home
during
the
vacation
he
was
so
rather
so
fortunate
as
the
issue
to
fall
in
love
and
running
across
the
border
with
his
eloped
bride
he
married
and
as
his
friends
thought
ruined
himself
for
life
he
had
neither
house
nor
home
when
he
married
and
had
not
yet
earned
a
penny
he
lost
his
fellowship
and
at
the
same
time
shut
himself
out
from
preferment
in
the
church
for
which
he
had
been
destined
he
accordingly
turned
his
attention
to
the
study
of
the
law
to
a
friend
he
wrote
i
have
married
rashly
but
it
is
my
determination
to
work
hard
to
provide
for
the
woman
i
john
scott
came
up
to
london
and
took
a
small
house
in
cursitor
lane
where
he
settled
down
to
the
study
of
the
law
he
worked
with
great
diligence
and
resolution
rising
at
four
every
morning
and
studying
till
late
at
night
binding
a
wet
towel
round
his
head
to
keep
himself
awake
too
poor
to
study
under
a
special
pleader
he
copied
out
three
folio
volumes
from
a
manuscript
collection
of
precedents
long
after
when
lord
chancellor
passing
down
cursitor
lane
one
day
he
said
to
his
secretary
here
was
my
first
perch
many
a
time
do
i
recollect
coming
down
this
street
with
sixpence
in
my
hand
to
buy
sprats
for
when
at
length
called
to
the
bar
he
waited
long
for
employment
his
first
year
s
earnings
amounted
to
only
nine
shillings
for
four
years
he
assiduously
attended
the
london
courts
and
the
northern
circuit
with
little
better
success
even
in
his
native
town
he
seldom
had
other
than
pauper
cases
to
defend
the
results
were
indeed
so
discouraging
that
he
had
almost
determined
to
relinquish
his
chance
of
london
business
and
settle
down
in
some
provincial
town
as
a
country
barrister
his
brother
william
wrote
home
business
is
dull
with
poor
jack
very
dull
indeed
but
as
he
had
escaped
being
a
grocer
a
and
a
country
parson
so
did
he
also
escape
being
a
country
lawyer
an
opportunity
at
length
occurred
which
enabled
john
scott
to
exhibit
the
large
legal
knowledge
which
he
had
so
laboriously
acquired
in
a
case
in
which
he
was
engaged
he
urged
a
legal
point
against
the
wishes
both
of
the
attorney
and
client
who
employed
him
the
master
of
the
rolls
decided
against
him
but
on
an
appeal
to
the
house
of
lords
lord
thurlow
reversed
the
decision
on
the
very
point
that
scott
had
urged
on
leaving
the
house
that
day
a
solicitor
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
young
man
your
bread
and
butter
s
cut
for
and
the
prophecy
proved
a
true
one
lord
mansfield
used
to
say
that
he
knew
no
interval
between
no
business
and
and
scott
might
have
told
the
same
story
for
so
rapid
was
his
progress
that
in
when
only
he
was
appointed
king
s
counsel
was
at
the
head
of
the
northern
circuit
and
sat
in
parliament
for
the
borough
of
weobley
it
was
in
the
dull
but
unflinching
drudgery
of
the
early
part
of
his
career
that
he
laid
the
foundation
of
his
future
success
he
won
his
spurs
by
perseverance
knowledge
and
ability
diligently
cultivated
he
was
successively
appointed
to
the
offices
of
solicitor
and
and
rose
steadily
upwards
to
the
highest
office
that
the
crown
had
to
of
lord
chancellor
of
england
which
he
held
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
henry
bickersteth
was
the
son
of
a
surgeon
at
kirkby
lonsdale
in
westmoreland
and
was
himself
educated
to
that
profession
as
a
student
at
edinburgh
he
distinguished
himself
by
the
steadiness
with
which
he
worked
and
the
application
which
he
devoted
to
the
science
of
medicine
returned
to
kirkby
lonsdale
he
took
an
active
part
in
his
father
s
practice
but
he
had
no
liking
for
the
profession
and
grew
discontented
with
the
obscurity
of
a
country
town
he
went
on
nevertheless
diligently
improving
himself
and
engaged
on
speculations
in
the
higher
branches
of
physiology
in
conformity
with
his
own
wish
his
father
consented
to
send
him
to
cambridge
where
it
was
his
intention
to
take
a
medical
degree
with
the
view
of
practising
in
the
metropolis
close
application
to
his
studies
however
threw
him
out
of
health
and
with
a
view
to
his
strength
he
accepted
the
appointment
of
travelling
physician
to
lord
oxford
while
abroad
he
mastered
italian
and
acquired
a
great
admiration
for
italian
literature
but
no
greater
liking
for
medicine
than
before
on
the
contrary
he
determined
to
abandon
it
but
returning
to
cambridge
he
took
his
degree
and
that
he
worked
hard
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
he
was
senior
wrangler
of
his
year
disappointed
in
his
desire
to
enter
the
army
he
turned
to
the
bar
and
entered
a
student
of
the
inner
temple
he
worked
as
hard
at
law
as
he
had
done
at
medicine
writing
to
his
father
he
said
everybody
says
to
me
you
are
certain
of
success
in
the
persevere
and
though
i
don
t
well
understand
how
this
is
to
happen
i
try
to
believe
it
as
much
as
i
can
and
i
shall
not
fail
to
do
everything
in
my
at
he
was
called
to
the
bar
and
had
every
step
in
life
yet
to
make
his
means
were
straitened
and
he
lived
upon
the
contributions
of
his
friends
for
years
he
studied
and
waited
still
no
business
came
he
stinted
himself
in
recreation
in
clothes
and
even
in
the
necessaries
of
life
struggling
on
indefatigably
through
all
writing
home
he
confessed
that
he
hardly
knew
how
he
should
be
able
to
struggle
on
till
he
had
fair
time
and
opportunity
to
establish
after
three
years
waiting
still
without
success
he
wrote
to
his
friends
that
rather
than
be
a
burden
upon
them
longer
he
was
willing
to
give
the
matter
up
and
return
to
cambridge
where
he
was
sure
of
support
and
some
the
friends
at
home
sent
him
another
small
remittance
and
he
persevered
business
gradually
came
in
acquitting
himself
creditably
in
small
matters
he
was
at
length
entrusted
with
cases
of
greater
importance
he
was
a
man
who
never
missed
an
opportunity
nor
allowed
a
legitimate
chance
of
improvement
to
escape
him
his
unflinching
industry
soon
began
to
tell
upon
his
fortunes
a
few
more
years
and
he
was
not
only
enabled
to
do
without
assistance
from
home
but
he
was
in
a
position
to
pay
back
with
interest
the
debts
which
he
had
incurred
the
clouds
had
dispersed
and
the
after
career
of
henry
bickersteth
was
one
of
honour
of
emolument
and
of
distinguished
fame
he
ended
his
career
as
master
of
the
rolls
sitting
in
the
house
of
peers
as
baron
langdale
his
life
affords
only
another
illustration
of
the
power
of
patience
perseverance
and
conscientious
working
in
elevating
the
character
of
the
individual
and

worked
their

to

by
the
diligent
exercise

the
ancient

of

with
the

was
an
expression
of
the

sturdy
independence
which
to
this

distinguishes
the
descendants
of
the
northmen
indeed
nothing
could
be
more
characteristic
of
the
scandinavian
mythology
than
that
it
had

a

in

from

slight
a
test
as
the
mode
in
which
a

wields
a

his
energy
may
in
some
measure
be

thus
an
eminent
frenchman
hit
off
in
a
single
phrase
the
characteristic
quality
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
particular
district
in
which
a

of

strikingly

the
fact
that
it

the

of

upon

be
defined

nothing

by

in

charles
ix
of
sweden
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
power
of
will
even
in
youth
laying
his
hand
on
the
head
of
his
youngest
son
when
engaged
on
a
difficult
task
he
exclaimed
he
do
it
he
do
it
the
habit
of
application
becomes
easy
in
time
like
every
other
habit
thus
persons
with
comparatively
moderate
powers
will
accomplish
much
if
they
apply
themselves
wholly
and
indefatigably
to
one
thing
at
a
time
fowell
buxton
placed
his
confidence
in
ordinary
means
and
extraordinary
application
realizing
the
scriptural
injunction
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
all
thy
might
and
he
attributed
his
own
success
in
life
to
his
practice
of
being
a
whole
man
to
one
thing
at
a
nothing
that
is
of
real
worth
can
be
achieved
without
courageous
working
man
owes
his
growth
chiefly
to
that
active
striving
of
the
will
that
encounter
with
difficulty
which
we
call
effort
and
it
is
astonishing
to
find
how
often
results
apparently
impracticable
are
thus
made
possible
an
intense
anticipation
itself
transforms
possibility
into
reality
our
desires
being
often
but
the
precursors
of
the
things
which
we
are
capable
of
performing
on
the
contrary
the
timid
and
hesitating
find
everything
impossible
chiefly
because
it
seems
so
it
is
related
of
a
young
french
officer
that
he
used
to
walk
about
his
apartment
exclaiming
i
be
marshal
of
france
and
a
great
his
ardent
desire
was
the
presentiment
of
his
success
for
the
young
officer
did
become
a
distinguished
commander
and
he
died
a
marshal
of
france
walker
author
of
the
original
had
so
great
a
faith
in
the
power
of
will
that
he
says
on
one
occasion
he
to
be
well
and
he
was
so
this
may
answer
once
but
though
safer
to
follow
than
many
prescriptions
it
will
not
always
succeed
the
power
of
mind
over
body
is
no
doubt
great
but
it
may
be
strained
until
the
physical
power
breaks
down
altogether
it
is
related
of
muley
moluc
the
moorish
leader
that
when
lying
ill
almost
worn
out
by
an
incurable
disease
a
battle
took
place
between
his
troops
and
the
portuguese
when
starting
from
his
litter
at
the
great
crisis
of
the
fight
he
rallied
his
army
led

to

afterwards

accustomed

whatever
you

such
is
the
force
of

to
the

that
whatever
we

and
with
a
true
intention
that
we
become
no

ardently

to
be

or

who
does
not

what
he
the
story
is
told
of
a
working
carpenter
who
was
observed
one
day
planing
a
magistrate
s
bench
which
he
was
repairing
with
more
than
usual
carefulness
and
when
asked
the
reason
he
replied
because
i
wish
to
make
it
easy
against
the
time
when
i
come
to
sit
upon
it
and
singularly
enough
the
man
actually
lived
to
sit
upon
that
very
bench
as
a
magistrate
whatever
theoretical
conclusions
logicians
may
have
formed
as
to
the
freedom
of
the
will
each
individual
feels
that
practically
he
is
free
to
choose
between
good
and
he
is
not
as
a
mere
straw
thrown
upon
the
water
to
mark
the
direction
of
the
current
but
that
he
has
within
him
the
power
of
a
strong
swimmer
and
is
capable
of
striking
out
for
himself
of
buffeting
with
the
waves
and
directing
to
a
great
extent
his
own
independent
course
there
is
no
absolute
constraint
upon
our
volitions
and
we
feel
and
know
that
we
are
not
bound
as
by
a
spell
with
reference
to
our
actions
it
would
paralyze
all
desire
of
excellence
were
we
to
think
otherwise
the
entire
business
and
conduct
of
life
with
its
domestic
rules
its
social
arrangements
and
its
public
institutions
proceed
upon
the
practical
conviction
that
the
will
is
free
without
this
where
would
be
responsibility
what
the
advantage
of
teaching
advising
preaching
reproof
and
correction
what
were
the
use
of
laws
were
it
not
the
universal
belief
as
it
is
the
universal
fact
that
men
obey
them
or
not
very
much
as
they
individually
determine
in
every
moment
of
our
life
conscience
is
proclaiming
that
our
will
is
free
it
is
the
only
thing
that
is
wholly
ours
and
it
rests
solely
with
ourselves
individually
whether
we
give
it
the
right
or
the
wrong
direction
our
habits
or
our
temptations
are
not
our
masters
but
we
of
them
even
in
yielding
conscience
tells
us
we
might
resist
and
that
were
we
determined
to
master
them
there
would
not
be
required
for
that
purpose
a
stronger
resolution
than
we
know
ourselves
to
be
capable
of
exercising
you
are
now
at
the
age
said
lamennais
once
addressing
a
gay
youth
at
which
a
decision
must
be
formed
by
you
a
little
later
and
you
may
have
to
groan
within
the
tomb
which
you
yourself
have
dug
without
the
power
of
rolling
away
the
stone
that
which
the
easiest
becomes
a
habit
in
us
is
the
will
learn
then
to
will
strongly
and
decisively
thus
fix
your
floating
life
and
leave
it
no
longer
to
be
carried
hither
and
thither
like
a
withered
leaf
by
every
wind
that
buxton
held
the
conviction
that
a
young
man
might
be
very
much
what
he
pleased
provided
he
formed
a
strong
resolution
and
held
to
it
writing
to
one
of
his
sons
he
said
to
him
you
are
now
at
that
period
of
life
in
which
you
must
make
a
turn
to
the
right
or
the
left
you
must
now
give
proofs
of
principle
determination
and
strength
of
mind
or
you
must
sink
into
idleness
and
acquire
the
habits
and
character
of
a
desultory
ineffective
young
man
and
if
once
you
fall
to
that
point
you
will
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
rise
again
i
am
sure
that
a
young
man
may
be
very
much
what
he
pleases
in
my
own
case
it
was
so
much
of
my
happiness
and
all
my
prosperity
in
life
have
resulted
from
the
change
i
made
at
your
age
if
you
seriously
resolve
to
be
energetic
and
industrious
depend
upon
it
that
you
will
for
your
whole
life
have
reason
to
rejoice
that
you
were
wise
enough
to
form
and
to
act
upon
that
as
will
considered
without
regard
to
direction
is
simply
constancy
firmness
perseverance
it
will
be
obvious
that
everything
depends
upon
right
direction
and
motives
directed
towards
the
enjoyment
of
the
senses
the
strong
will
may
be
a
demon
and
the
intellect
merely
its
debased
slave
but
directed
towards
good
the
strong
will
is
a
king
and
the
intellect
the
minister
of
man
s
highest
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
a
way
is
an
old
and
true
saying
he
who
resolves
upon
doing
a
thing
by
that
very
resolution
often
scales
the
barriers
to
it
and
secures
its
achievement
to
think
we
are
able
is
almost
to
be
determine
upon
attainment
is
frequently
attainment
itself
thus
earnest
resolution
has
often
seemed
to
have
about
it
almost
a
savour
of
omnipotence
the
strength
of
suwarrow
s
character
lay
in
his
power
of
willing
and
like
most
resolute
persons
he
preached
it
up
as
a
system
you
can
only
half
will
he
would
say
to
people
who
failed
like
richelieu
and
napoleon
he
would
have
the
word
impossible
banished
from
the
dictionary
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
and
impossible
were
words
which
he
detested
above
all
others
learn
do
try
he
would
exclaim
his
biographer
has
said
of
him
that
he
furnished
a
remarkable
illustration
of
what
may
be
effected
by
the
energetic
development
and
exercise
of
faculties
the
germs
of
which
at
least
are
in
every
human
heart
one
of
napoleon
s
favourite
maxims
was
the
truest
wisdom
is
a
resolute
his
life
beyond
most
others
vividly
showed
what
a
powerful
and
unscrupulous
will
could
accomplish
he
threw
his
whole
force
of
body
and
mind
direct
upon
his
work
imbecile
rulers
and
the
nations
they
governed
went
down
before
him
in
succession
he
was
told
that
the
alps
stood
in
the
way
of
his
there
shall
be
no
alps
he
said
and
the
road
across
the
simplon
was
constructed
through
a
district
formerly
almost
inaccessible
impossible
said
he
is
a
word
only
to
be
found
in
the
dictionary
of
he
was
a
man
who
toiled
terribly
sometimes
employing
and
exhausting
four
secretaries
at
a
time
he
spared
no
one
not
even
himself
his
influence
inspired
other
men
and
put
a
new
life
into
them
i
made
my
generals
out
of
mud
he
said
but
all
was
of
no
avail
for
napoleon
s
intense
selfishness
was
his
ruin
and
the
ruin
of
france
which
he
left
a
prey
to
anarchy
his
life
taught
the
lesson
that
power
however
energetically
wielded
without
beneficence
is
fatal
to
its
possessor
and
its
subjects
and
that
knowledge
or
knowingness
without
goodness
is
but
the
incarnate
principle
of
evil
our
own
wellington
was
a
far
greater
man
not
less
resolute
firm
and
persistent
but
more
conscientious
and
truly
patriotic
napoleon
s
aim
was
glory
wellington
s
watchword
like
nelson
s
was
the
former
word
it
is
said
does
not
once
occur
in
his
despatches
the
latter
often
but
never
accompanied
by
any
professions
the
greatest
difficulties
could
neither
embarrass
nor
intimidate
wellington
his
energy
invariably
rising
in
proportion
to
the
obstacles
to
be
surmounted
the
patience
the
firmness
the
resolution
with
which
he
bore
through
the
maddening
vexations
and
gigantic
difficulties
of
the
peninsular
campaigns
is
perhaps
one
of
the
sublimest
things
to
be
found
in
history
in
spain
wellington
not
only
exhibited
the
genius
of
the
general
but
the
comprehensive
wisdom
of
the
statesman
though
his
natural
temper
was
irritable
in
the
extreme
his
high
sense
of
duty
enabled
him
to
restrain
it
and
to
those
about
him
his
patience
seemed
absolutely
inexhaustible
his
great
character
stands
untarnished
by
ambition
by
avarice
or
any
low
passion
though
a
man
of
powerful
individuality
he
yet
displayed
a
great
variety
of
endowment
the
equal
of
napoleon
in
generalship
he
was
as
prompt
vigorous
and
daring
as
clive
as
wise
a
statesman
as
cromwell
and
as
pure
and
as
washington
the
great
wellington
left
behind
him
an
enduring
reputation
founded
on
toilsome
campaigns
won
by
skilful
combination
by
fortitude
which
nothing
could
exhaust
by
sublime
daring
and
perhaps
by
still
sublimer
patience
energy
usually
displays
itself
in
promptitude
and
decision
when
ledyard
the
traveller
was
asked
by
the
african
association
when
he
would
be
ready
to
set
out
for
africa
he
immediately
answered
blucher
s
promptitude
obtained
for
him
the
cognomen
of
marshal

throughout
the
prussian
army
when
john
jervis
afterwards
earl
vincent
was
asked
when
he
would
be
ready
to
join
his
ship
he
replied
and
when
sir
colin
campbell
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
indian
army
was
asked
when
he
could
set
out
his
answer
was
earnest
of
his
subsequent
success
for
it
is
rapid
decision
and
a
similar
promptitude
in
action
such
as
taking
instant
advantage
of
an
enemy
s
mistakes
that
so
often

battles
at
arcola
said
napoleon
i
won
the
battle
with

i
seized
a
moment
of
lassitude
gave
every
man
a
trumpet
and
gained
the
day

this
handful

be
turned

said
he
at

opportunity
for
misfortune
and
he
declared
that
he
beat

they
never
knew
the

dawdled
he
overthrew

has
during
the
last

been
a
great
field
for
the
display
of

energy
from

there
is
a

and

roll
of
distinguished

and
warfare
as
wellesley

outram

and
the
lawrences
another
great
but
sullied
name
is
that
of
warren
man
of
dauntless
will
and
indefatigable
industry
his
family
was
ancient
and
illustrious
but
their
vicissitudes
of
fortune
and
loyalty
in
the
cause
of
the
stuarts
brought
them
to
poverty
and
the
family
estate
at
daylesford
of
which
they
had
been
lords
of
the
manor
for
hundreds
of
years
at
length
passed
from
their
hands
the
last
hastings
of
daylesford
had
however
presented
the
parish
living
to
his
second
son
and
it
was
in
his
house
many
years
later
that
warren
hastings
his
grandson
was
born
the
boy
learnt
his
letters
at
the
village
school
on
the
same
bench
with
the
children
of
the
peasantry
he
played
in
the
fields
which
his
fathers
had
owned
and
what
the
loyal
and
brave
hastings
of
daylesford
been
was
ever
in
the
boy
s
thoughts
his
young
ambition
was
fired
and
it
is
said
that
one
summer
s
day
when
only
seven
years
old
as
he
laid
him
down
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
which
flowed
through
the
domain
he
formed
in
his
mind
the
resolution
that
he
would
yet
recover
possession
of
the
family
lands
it
was
the
romantic
vision
of
a
boy
yet
he
lived
to
realize
it
the
dream
became
a
passion
rooted
in
his
very
life
and
he
pursued
his
determination
through
youth
up
to
manhood
with
that
calm
but
indomitable
force
of
will
which
was
the
most
striking
peculiarity
of
his
character
the
orphan
boy
became
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
of
his
time
he
retrieved
the
fortunes
of
his
line
bought
back
the
old
estate
and
rebuilt
the
family
mansion
when
under
a
tropical
sun
says
macaulay
he
ruled
fifty
millions
of
asiatics
his
hopes
amidst
all
the
cares
of
war
finance
and
legislation
still
pointed
to
daylesford
and
when
his
long
public
life
so
singularly
chequered
with
good
and
evil
with
glory
and
obloquy
had
at
length
closed
for
ever
it
was
to
daylesford
that
he
retired
to
sir
charles
napier
was
another
indian
leader
of
extraordinary
courage
and
determination
he
once
said
of
the
difficulties
with
which
he
was
surrounded
in
one
of
his
campaigns
they
only
make
my
feet
go
deeper
into
the
his
battle
of
meeanee
was
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
feats
in
history
with
men
of
whom
only
were
europeans
he
encountered
an
army
of
hardy
and
beloochees
it
was
an
act
apparently
of
the
most
daring
temerity
but
the
general
had
faith
in
himself
and
in
his
men
he
charged
the
belooch
centre
up
a
high
bank
which
formed
their
rampart
in
front
and
for
three
mortal
hours
the
battle
raged
each
man
of
that
small
force
inspired
by
the
chief
became
for
the
time
a
hero
the
beloochees
though
twenty
to
one
were
driven
back
but
with
their
faces
to
the
foe
it
is
this
sort
of
pluck
tenacity
and
determined
perseverance
which
wins
soldiers
battles
and
indeed
every
battle
it
is
the
one
neck
nearer
that
wins
the
race
and
shows
the
blood
it
is
the
one
march
more
that
wins
the
campaign
the
five
minutes
more
persistent
courage
that
wins
the

though
your
force
be

you

if
you
continue

concentrate

the
reply
of
the
spartan
father
who
said
to
his
son
when
complaining
that
his
sword
was
too
short
add
a
step
to
it
is
applicable
to
everything
in
life
napier
took
the
right
method
of
inspiring
his
men
with
his
own
heroic
spirit
he
worked
as
hard
as
any
private
in
the
ranks
the
great
art
of
commanding
he
said
is
to
take
a
fair
share
of
the
work
the
man
who
leads
an
army
can
not
succeed
unless
his
whole
mind
is
thrown
into
his
work
the
more
trouble
the
more
labour
must
be
given
the
more
danger
the
more
pluck
must
be
shown
till
all
is
a
young
officer
who
accompanied
him
in
his
campaign
in
the
cutchee
hills
once
said
when
i
see
that
old
man
incessantly
on
his
horse
how
can
i
be
idle
who
am
young
and
strong
i
would
go
into
a
loaded
cannon
s
mouth
if
he
ordered
this
remark
when
repeated
to
napier
he
said
was
ample
reward
for
his
toils
the
anecdote
of
his
interview
with
the
indian
juggler
strikingly
illustrates
his
cool
courage
as
well
as
his
remarkable
simplicity
and
honesty
of
character
on
one
occasion
after
the
indian
battles
a
famous
juggler
visited
the
camp
and
performed
his
feats
before
the
general
his
family
and
staff
among
other
performances
this
man
cut
in
two
with
a
stroke
of
his
sword
a
lime
or
lemon
placed
in
the
hand
of
his
assistant
napier
thought
there
was
some
collusion
between
the
juggler
and
his
retainer
to
divide
by
a
sweep
of
the
sword
on
a
man
s
hand
so
small
an
object
without
touching
the
flesh
he
believed
to
be
impossible
though
a
similar
incident
is
related
by
scott
in
his
romance
of
the
to
determine
the
point
the
general
offered
his
own
hand
for
the
experiment
and
he
stretched
out
his
right
arm
the
juggler
looked
attentively
at
the
hand
and
said
he
would
not
make
the
trial
i
thought
i
would
find
you
out
exclaimed
napier
but
stop
added
the
other
let
me
see
your
left
the
left
hand
was
submitted
and
the
man
then
said
firmly
if
you
will
hold
your
arm
steady
i
will
perform
the
but
why
the
left
hand
and
not
the
right
because
the
right
hand
is
hollow
in
the
centre
and
there
is
a
risk
of
cutting
off
the
thumb
the
left
is
high
and
the
danger
will
be
napier
was
startled
i
got
frightened
he
said
i
saw
it
was
an
actual
feat
of
delicate
swordsmanship
and
if
i
had
not
abused
the
man
as
i
did
before
my
staff
and
challenged
him
to
the
trial
i
honestly
acknowledge
i
would
have
retired
from
the
encounter
however
i
put
the
lime
on
my
hand
and
held
out
my
arm
steadily
the
juggler
balanced
himself
and
with
a
swift
stroke
cut
the
lime
in
two
pieces
i
felt
the
edge
of
the
sword
on
my
hand
as
if
a
cold
thread
had
been
drawn
across
it
so
much
he
added
for
the
brave
swordsmen
of
india
whom
our
fine
fellows
defeated
at
the
recent
terrible
struggle
in
india
has
served
to
bring
out
perhaps
more
prominently
than
any
previous
event
in
our
history
the
determined
energy
and
of
the
national
character
although
english
officialism
may
often
drift
stupidly
into
gigantic
blunders
the
men
of
the
nation
generally
contrive
to
work
their
way
out
of
them
with
a
heroism
almost
approaching
the
sublime
in
may
when
the
revolt
burst
upon
india
like
a
the
british
forces
had
been
allowed
to
dwindle
to
their
extreme
minimum
and
were
scattered
over
a
wide
extent
of
country
many
of
them
in
remote
cantonments
the
bengal
regiments
one
after
another
rose
against
their
officers
broke
away
and
rushed
to
delhi
province
after
province
was
lapped
in
mutiny
and
rebellion
and
the
cry
for
help
rose
from
east
to
west
everywhere
the
english
stood
at
bay
in
small
detachments
beleaguered
and
surrounded
apparently
incapable
of
resistance
their
discomfiture
seemed
so
complete
and
the
utter
ruin
of
the
british
cause
in
india
so
certain
that
it
might
be
said
of
them
then
as
it
had
been
said
before
these
english
never
know
when
they
are
according
to
rule
they
ought
then
and
there
to
have
succumbed
to
inevitable
fate
while
the
issue
of
the
mutiny
still
appeared
uncertain
holkar
one
of
the
native
princes
consulted
his
astrologer
for
information
the
reply
was
if
all
the
europeans
save
one
are
slain
that
one
will
remain
to
fight
and
in
their
very
darkest
where
as
at
lucknow
a
mere
handful
of
british
soldiers
civilians
and
women
held
out
amidst
a
city
and
province
in
arms
against
was
no
word
of
despair
no
thought
of
surrender
though
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
their
friends
for
months
and
not
knowing
whether
india
was
lost
or
held
they
never
ceased
to
have
perfect
faith
in
the
courage
and
devotedness
of
their
countrymen
they
knew
that
while
a
body
of
men
of
english
race
held
together
in
india
they
would
not
be
left
unheeded
to
perish
they
never
dreamt
of
any
other
issue
but
retrieval
of
their
misfortune
and
ultimate
triumph
and
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
they
could
but
fall
at
their
post
and
die
in
the
performance
of
their
duty
need
we
remind
the
reader
of
the
names
of
havelock
inglis
neill
and
of
truly
heroic
each
of
whom
it
might
with
truth
be
said
that
he
had
the
heart
of
a
chevalier
the
soul
of
a
believer
and
the
temperament
of
a
martyr
montalembert
has
said
of
them
that
they
do
honour
to
the
human
but
throughout
that
terrible
trial
almost
all
proved
equally
civilians
and
the
general
down
through
all
grades
to
the
private
and
bugleman
the
men
were
not
picked
they
belonged
to
the
same
ordinary
people
whom
we
daily
meet
at
the
streets
in
workshops
in
the
fields
at
clubs
yet
when
sudden
disaster
fell
upon
them
each
and
all
displayed
a
wealth
of
personal
resources
and
energy
and
became
as
it
were
individually
heroic
not
one
of
them
says
montalembert
shrank
or
military
and
civilians
young
and
old
generals
and
soldiers
resisted
fought
and
perished
with
a
coolness
and
intrepidity
which
never
faltered
it
is
in
this
circumstance
that
shines
out
the
immense
value
of
public
education
which
invites
the
englishman
from
his
youth
to
make
use
of
his
strength
and
his
liberty
to
associate
resist
fear
nothing
to
be
astonished
at
nothing
and
to
save
himself
by
his
own
sole
exertions
from
every
sore
strait
in
it
has
been
said
that
delhi
was
taken
and
india
saved
by
the
personal
character
of
sir
john
lawrence
the
very
name
of
lawrence
represented
power
in
the
provinces
his
standard
of
duty
zeal
and
personal
effort
was
of
the
highest
and
every
man
who
served
under
him
seemed
to
be
inspired
by
his
spirit
it
was
declared
of
him
that
his
character
alone
was
worth
an
army
the
same
might
be
said
of
his
brother
sir
henry
who
organised
the
punjaub
force
that
took
so
prominent
a
part
in
the
capture
of
delhi
both
brothers
inspired
those
who
were
about
them
with
perfect
love
and
confidence
both
possessed
that
quality
of
tenderness
which
is
one
of
the
true
elements
of
the
heroic
character
both
lived
amongst
the
people
and
powerfully
influenced
them
for
good
above
all
as
edwardes
says
they
drew
models
on
young
fellows
minds
which
they
went
forth
and
copied
in
their
several
administrations
they
sketched
a
and
begot
a
which
are
both
living
things
at
this
sir
john
lawrence
had
by
his
side
such
men
as
montgomery
nicholson
cotton
and
edwardes
as
prompt
decisive
and
as
himself
john
nicholson
was
one
of
the
finest
manliest
and
noblest
of
every
inch
a
hakim
the
natives
said
of
a
tower
of
strength
as
he
was
characterised
by
lord
dalhousie
in
whatever
capacity
he
acted
he
was
great
because
he
acted
with
his
whole
strength
and
soul
a
brotherhood
of
away
by
their
enthusiastic
admiration
of
the
began
the
worship
of
nikkil
seyn
he
had
some
of
them
punished
for
their
folly
but
they
continued
their
worship
nevertheless
of
his
sustained
energy
and
persistency
an
illustration
may
be
cited
in
his
pursuit
of
the
sepoy
mutineers
when
he
was
in
the
saddle
for
twenty
consecutive
hours
and
travelled
more
than
seventy
miles
when
the
enemy
set
up
their
standard
at
delhi
lawrence
and
montgomery
relying
on
the
support
of
the
people
of
the
punjaub
and
compelling
their
admiration
and
confidence
strained
every
nerve
to
keep
their
own
province
in
perfect
order
whilst
they
hurled
every
available
soldier
european
and
sikh
against
that
city
sir
john
wrote
to
the
to
hang
on
to
the
rebels
noses
before
delhi
while
the
troops
pressed
on
by
forced
marches
under
nicholson
the
tramp
of
whose
might
be
heard
miles
off
as
was
afterwards
said
of
him
by
a
rough
sikh
who
wept
over
his
grave
the
siege
and
storming
of
delhi
was
the
most
illustrious
event
which
occurred
in
the
course
of
that
gigantic
struggle
although
the
leaguer
of
lucknow
during
which
the
merest
skeleton
of
a
british
out
under
the
heroic
inglis
for
six
months
against
two
hundred
thousand
armed
enemies
has
perhaps
excited
more
intense
interest
at
delhi
too
the
british
were
really
the
besieged
though
ostensibly
the
besiegers
they
were
a
mere
handful
of
men
in
the
open
more
than
bayonets
european
and
they
were
assailed
from
day
to
day
by
an
army
of
rebels
numbering
at
one
time
as
many
as
men
trained
to
european
discipline
by
english
officers
and
supplied
with
all
but
exhaustless
munitions
of
war
the
heroic
little
band
sat
down
before
the
city
under
the
burning
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
death
wounds
and
fever
failed
to
turn
them
from
their
purpose
thirty
times
they
were
attacked
by
overwhelming
numbers
and
thirty
times
did
they
drive
back
the
enemy
behind
their
defences
as
captain
one
of
the
bravest
said
i
venture
to
aver
that
no
other
nation
in
the
world
would
have
remained
here
or
avoided
defeat
if
they
had
attempted
to
do
never
for
an
instant
did
these
heroes
falter
at
their
work
with
sublime
endurance
they
held
on
fought
on
and
never
relaxed
until
dashing
through
the
imminent
deadly
breach
the
place
was
won
and
the
british
flag
was
again
unfurled
on
the
walls
of
delhi
all
were
officers
and
generals
common
soldiers
who
had
been
inured
to
a
life
of
hardship
and
young
officers
who
had
been
nursed
in
luxurious
homes
alike
proved
their
manhood
and
emerged
from
that
terrible
trial
with
equal
honour
the
native
strength
and
soundness
of
the
english
race
and
of
manly
english
training
and
discipline
were
never
more
powerfully
exhibited
and
it
was
there
emphatically
proved
that
the
men
of
england
are
after
all
its
greatest
products
a
terrible
price
was
paid
for
this
great
chapter
in
our
history
but
if
those
who
survive
and
those
who
come
after
profit
by
the
lesson
and
example
it
may
not
have
been
purchased
at
too
great
a
cost
but
not
less
energy
and
courage
have
been
displayed
in
india
and
the
east
by
men
of
various
nations
in
other
lines
of
action
more
peaceful
and
beneficent
than
that
of
war
and
while
the
heroes
of
the
sword
are
remembered
the
heroes
of
the
gospel
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
from
xavier
to
martyn
and
williams
there
has
been
a
succession
of
illustrious
missionary
labourers
working
in
a
spirit
of
sublime
without
any
thought
of
worldly
honour
inspired
solely
by
the
hope
of
seeking
out
and
rescuing
the
lost
and
fallen
of
their
race
borne
up
by
invincible
courage
and
patience
these
men
have
endured
privations
braved
dangers
walked
through
pestilence
and
borne
all
toils
fatigues
and
sufferings
yet
held
on
their
way
rejoicing
glorying
even
in
martyrdom
itself
of
these
one
of
the
first
and
most
illustrious
was
francis
xavier
born
of
noble
lineage
and
with
pleasure
power
and
honour
within
his
reach
he
proved
by
his
life
that
there
are
higher
objects
in
the
world
than
rank
and
nobler
aspirations
than
the
accumulation
of
wealth
he
was
a
true
gentleman
in
manners
and
sentiment
brave
honourable
generous
easily
led
yet
capable
of
leading
easily
persuaded
yet
himself
persuasive
a
most
patient
resolute
and
energetic
man
at
the
age
of
he
was
earning
his
living
as
a
public
teacher
of
philosophy
at
the
university
of
paris
there
xavier
became
the
intimate
friend
and
associate
of
loyola
and
shortly
afterwards
he
conducted
the
pilgrimage
of
the
first
little
band
of
proselytes
to
rome
when
john
iii
of
portugal
resolved
to
plant
christianity
in
the
indian
territories
subject
to
his
influence
bobadilla
was
first
selected
as
his
missionary
but
being
disabled
by
illness
it
was
found
necessary
to
make
another
selection
and
xavier
was
chosen
repairing
his
tattered
cassock
and
with
no
other
baggage
than
his
breviary
he
at
once
started
for
lisbon
and
embarked
for
the
east
the
ship
in
which
he
set
sail
for
goa
had
the
governor
on
board
with
a
reinforcement
of
a
thousand
men
for
the
garrison
of
the
place
though
a
cabin
was
placed
at
his
disposal
xavier
slept
on
deck
throughout
the
voyage
with
his
head
on
a
coil
of
ropes
messing
with
the
sailors
by
ministering
to
their
wants
inventing
innocent
sports
for
their
amusement
and
attending
them
in
their
sickness
he
wholly
won
their
hearts
and
they
regarded
him
with
veneration
arrived
at
goa
xavier
was
shocked
at
the
depravity
of
the
people
settlers
as
well
as
natives
for
the
former
had
imported
the
vices
without
the
restraints
of
civilization
and
the
latter
had
only
been
too
apt
to
imitate
their
bad
example
passing
along
the
streets
of
the
city
sounding
his
handbell
as
he
went
he
implored
the
people
to
send
him
their
children
to
be
instructed
he
shortly
succeeded
in
collecting
a
large
number
of
scholars
whom
he
carefully
taught
day
by
day
at
the
same
time
visiting
the
sick
the
lepers
and
the
wretched
of
all
classes
with
the
object
of
assuaging
their
miseries
and
bringing
them
to
the
truth
no
cry
of
human
suffering
which
reached
him
was
disregarded
hearing
of
the
degradation
and
misery
of
the
pearl
fishers
of
manaar
he
set
out
to
visit
them
and
his
bell
again
rang
out
the
invitation
of
mercy
he
baptized
and
he
taught
but
the
latter
he
could
only
do
through
interpreters
his
most
eloquent
teaching
was
his
ministration
to
the
wants
and
the
sufferings
of
the
wretched
on
he
went
his
sounding
along
the
coast
of
comorin
among
the
towns
and
villages
the
temples
and
the
bazaars
summoning
the
natives
to
gather
about
him
and
be
instructed
he
had
translations
made
of
the
catechism
the
apostles
creed
the
commandments
the
lord
s
prayer
and
some
of
the
devotional
offices
of
the
church
committing
these
to
memory
in
their
own
tongue
he
recited
them
to
the
children
until
they
had
them
by
heart
after
which
he
sent
them
forth
to
teach
the
words
to
their
parents
and
neighbours
at
cape
comorin
he
appointed
thirty
teachers
who
under
himself
presided
over
thirty
christian
churches
though
the
churches
were
but
humble
in
most
cases
consisting
only
of
a
cottage
surmounted
by
a
cross
thence
he
passed
to
travancore
sounding
his
way
from
village
to
village
baptizing
until
his
hands
dropped
with
weariness
and
repeating
his
formulas
until
his
voice
became
almost
inaudible
according
to
his
own
account
the
success
of
his
mission
surpassed
his
highest
expectations
his
pure
earnest
and
beautiful
life
and
the
irresistible
eloquence
of
his
deeds
made
converts
wherever
he
went
and
by
sheer
force
of
sympathy
those
who
saw
him
and
listened
to
him
insensibly
caught
a
portion
of
his
ardour
burdened
with
the
thought
that
the
harvest
is
great
and
the
labourers
are
few

to
malacca
and
japan
where
he
found
himself
amongst
entirely
new
races
speaking
other
tongues
the
most
that
he
could
do
here
was
to
weep
and
pray
to
smooth
the
pillow
and
watch
by
the
sometimes
soaking
the
sleeve
of
his
surplice
in
water
from
which
to
squeeze
out
a
few
drops
and
baptize
the
dying
hoping
all
things
and
fearing
nothing
this
valiant
soldier
of
the
truth
was
borne
onward
throughout
by
faith
and
energy
whatever
form
of
death
or
torture
said

awaits
me
i
am
ready
to
suffer
it
ten
thousand
times
for
the
salvation
of
a
single

battled
with
hunger
thirst
privations
and
dangers
of
all
kinds
still
pursuing
his
mission
of
love
unresting
and
unwearying
at
length
after
eleven
years
labour
this
great
good
man
while
striving
to
find
a
way
into
china
was
stricken
with
fever
in
the
island
of
sanchian
and
there
received
his
crown
of
glory
a
hero
of
nobler
mould
more
pure
and
courageous

probably
never
trod

john
williams
the
martyr
of
erromanga
was
originally
apprenticed
to
a
furnishing
ironmonger
though
considered
a
dull
boy
he
was
handy
at
his
trade
in
which
he
acquired
so
much
skill
that
his
master
usually
entrusted
him
with
any
blacksmiths
work
that
required
the
exercise
of
more
than
ordinary
care
he
was
also
fond
of
and
other
employments
which
took
him
away
from
the
shop
a
casual
sermon
which
he
heard
gave
his
mind
a
serious
bias
and
he
became
a
teacher
the
cause
of
missions
having
been
brought
under
his
notice
at
some
of
his
society
s
meetings
he
determined
to
devote
himself
to
this
work
his
services
were
accepted
by
the
london
missionary
society
and
his
master
allowed
him
to
leave
the
ironmonger
s
shop
before
the
expiry
of
his
indentures
the
islands
of
the
pacific
ocean
were
the
principal
scene
of
his
particularly
huahine
in
tahiti
raiatea
and
rarotonga
like
the
apostles
he
worked
with
his
hands
blacksmith
work
gardening
shipbuilding
and
he
endeavoured
to
teach
the
islanders
the
art
of
civilised
life
at
the
same
time
that
he
instructed
them
in
the
truths
of
religion
it
was
in
the
course
of
his
indefatigable
labours
that
he
was
massacred
by
savages
on
the
shore
of
worthier
than
he
to
wear
the
martyr
s
crown
the
career
of
livingstone
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
all
he
has
told
the
story
of
his
life
in
that
modest
and
unassuming
manner
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
man
himself
his
ancestors
were
poor
but
honest
highlanders
and
it
is
related
of
one
of
them
renowned
in
his
district
for
wisdom
and
prudence
that
when
on
his
he
called
his
children
round
him
and
left
them
these
words
the
only
legacy
he
had
to
in
my
said
he
i
have
searched
most
carefully
through
all
the
traditions
i
could
find
of
our
family
and
i
never
could
discover
that
there
was
a
dishonest
man
among
our
forefathers
if
therefore
any
of
you
or
any
of
your
children
should
take
to
dishonest
ways
it
will
not
be
because
it
runs
in
our
blood
it
does
not
belong
to
you
i
leave
this
precept
with
at
the
age
of
ten
livingstone
was
sent
to
work
in
a
cotton
factory
near
glasgow
as
a
with
part
of
his
first
week
s
wages
he
bought
a
latin
grammar
and
began
to
learn
that
language
pursuing
the
study
for
years
at
a
night
school
he
would
sit
up
conning
his
lessons
till
twelve
or
later
when
not
sent
to
bed
by
his
mother
for
he
had
to
be
up
and
at
work
in
the
factory
every
morning
by
six
in
this
way
he
plodded
through
virgil
and
horace
also
reading
extensively
all
books
excepting
novels
that
came
in
his
way
but
more
especially
scientific
works
and
books
of
travels
he
occupied
his
spare
hours
which
were
but
few
in
the
pursuit
of
botany
scouring
the
neighbourhood
to
collect
plants
he
even
carried
on
his
reading
amidst
the
roar
of
the
factory
machinery
so
placing
the
book
upon
the
spinning
jenny
which
he
worked
that
he
could
catch
sentence
after
sentence
as
he
passed
it
in
this
way
the
persevering
youth
acquired
much
useful
knowledge
and
as
he
grew
older
the
desire
possessed
him
of
becoming
a
missionary
to
the
heathen
with
this
object
he
set
himself
to
obtain
a
medical
education
in
order
the
better
to
be
qualified
for
the
work
he
accordingly
economised
his
earnings
and
saved
as
much
money
as
enabled
him
to
support
himself
while
attending
the
medical
and
greek
classes
as
well
as
the
divinity
lectures
at
glasgow
for
several
winters
working
as
a
cotton
spinner
during
the
remainder
of
each
year
he
thus
supported
himself
during
his
college
career
entirely
by
his
own
earnings
as
a
factory
workman
never
having
received
a
farthing
of
help
from
any
other
source
looking
back
now
he
honestly
says
at
that
life
of
toil
i
can
not
but
feel
thankful
that
it
formed
such
a
material
part
of
my
early
education
and
were
it
possible
i
should
like
to
begin
life
over
again
in
the
same
lowly
style
and
to
pass
through
the
same
hardy
at
length
he
finished
his
medical
curriculum
wrote
his
latin
thesis
passed
his
examinations
and
was
admitted
a
licentiate
of
the
faculty
of
physicians
and
surgeons
at
first
he
thought
of
going
to
china
but
the
war
then
waging
with
that
country
prevented
his
following
out
the
idea
and
having
offered
his
services
to
the
london
missionary
society
he
was
by
them
sent
out
to
africa
which
he
reached
in
he
had
intended
to
proceed
to
china
by
his
own
efforts
and
he
says
the
only
pang
he
had
in
going
to
africa
at
the
charge
of
the
london
missionary
society
was
because
it
was
not
quite
agreeable
to
one
accustomed
to
work
his
own
way
to
become
in
a
manner
dependent
upon
arrived
in
africa
he
set
to
work
with
great
zeal
he
could
not
brook
the
idea
of
merely
entering
upon
the
labours
of
others
but
cut
out
a
large
sphere
of
independent
work
preparing
himself
for
it
by
undertaking
manual
labour
in
building
and
other
handicraft
employment
in
addition
to
teaching
which
he
says
made
me
generally
as
much
exhausted
and
unfit
for
study
in
the
evenings
as
ever
i
had
been
when
a
whilst
labouring
amongst
the
bechuanas
he
dug
canals
built
houses
cultivated
fields
reared
cattle
and
taught
the
natives
to
work
as
well
as
worship
when
he
first
started
with
a
party
of
them
on
foot
upon
a
long
journey
he
overheard
their
observations
upon
his
appearance
and
he
is
not
strong
said
they
he
is
quite
slim
and
only
appears
stout
because
he
puts
himself
into
those
bags
trowsers
he
will
soon
knock
this
caused
the
missionary
s
highland
blood
to
rise
and
made
him
despise
the
fatigue
of
keeping
them
all
at
the
top
of
their
speed
for
days
together
until
he
heard
them
expressing
proper
opinions
of
his
pedestrian
powers
what
he
did
in
africa
and
how
he
worked
may
be
learnt
from
his
own
missionary
travels
one
of
the
most
fascinating
books
of
its
kind
that
has
ever
been
given
to
the
public
one
of
his
last
known
acts
is
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
man
the
birkenhead
steam
launch
which
he
took
out
with
him
to
africa
having
proved
a
failure
he
sent
home
orders
for
the
construction
of
another
vessel
at
an
estimated
cost
of
this
sum
he
proposed
to
defray
out
of
the
means
which
he
had
set
aside
for
his
children
arising
from
the
profits
of
his
books
of
travels
the
children
must
make
it
up
themselves
was
in
effect
his
expression
in
sending
home
the
order
for
the
appropriation
of
the
money
the
career
of
john
howard
was
throughout
a
striking
illustration
of
the
same
power
of
patient
purpose
his
sublime
life
proved
that
even
physical
weakness
could
remove
mountains
in
the
pursuit
of
an
end
recommended
by
duty
the
idea
of
ameliorating
the
condition
of
prisoners
engrossed
his
whole
thoughts
and
possessed
him
like
a
passion
and
no
toil
nor
danger
nor
bodily
suffering
could
turn
him
from
that
great
object
of
his
life
though
a
man
of
no
genius
and
but
moderate
talent
his
heart
was
pure
and
his
will
was
strong
even
in
his
own
time
he
achieved
a
remarkable
degree
of
success
and
his
influence
did
not
die
with
him
for
it
has
continued
powerfully
to
affect
not
only
the
legislation
of
england
but
of
all
civilised
nations
down
to
the
present
hour
jonas
hanway
was
another
of
the
many
patient
and
persevering
men
who
have
made
england
what
it
simply
to
do
with
energy
the
work
they
have
been
appointed
to
do
and
go
to
their
rest
thankfully
when
it
is
leaving
no
memorial
but
a
world
made
better
by
their
he
was
born
in
at
portsmouth
where
his
father
a
storekeeper
in
the
dockyard
being
killed
by
an
accident
he
was
left
an
orphan
at
an
early
age
his
mother
removed
with
her
children
to
london
where
she
had
them
put
to
school
and
struggled
hard
to
bring
them
up
respectably
at
seventeen
jonas
was
sent
to
lisbon
to
be
apprenticed
to
a
merchant
where
his
close
attention
to
business
his
punctuality
and
his
strict
honour
and
integrity
gained
for
him
the
respect
and
esteem
of
all
who
knew
him
returning
to
london
in
he
accepted
the
offer
of
a
partnership
in
an
english
mercantile
house
at
petersburg
engaged
in
the
caspian
trade
then
in
its
infancy
hanway
went
to
russia
for
the
purpose
of
extending
the
business
and
shortly
after
his
arrival
at
the
capital
he
set
out
for
persia
with
a
caravan
of
english
bales
of
cloth
making
twenty
carriage
loads
at
astracan
he
sailed
for
astrabad
on
the
shore
of
the
caspian
but
he
had
scarcely
landed
his
bales
when
an
insurrection
broke
out
his
goods
were
seized
and
though
he
afterwards
recovered
the
principal
part
of
them
the
fruits
of
his
enterprise
were
in
a
great
measure
lost
a
plot
was
set
on
foot
to
seize
himself
and
his
party
so
he
took
to
sea
and
after
encountering
great
perils
reached
ghilan
in
safety
his
escape
on
this
occasion
gave
him
the
first
idea
of
the
words
which
he
afterwards
adopted
as
the
motto
of
his
he
afterwards
resided
in
petersburg
for
five
years
carrying
on
a
prosperous
business
but
a
relative
having
left
him
some
property
and
his
own
means
being
considerable
he
left
russia
and
arrived
in
his
native
country
in
his
object
in
returning
to
england
was
as
he
himself
expressed
it
to
consult
his
own
health
which
was
extremely
delicate
and
do
as
much
good
to
himself
and
others
as
he
was
the
rest
of
his
life
was
spent
in
deeds
of
active
benevolence
and
usefulness
to
his
fellow
men
he
lived
in
a
quiet
style
in
order
that
he
might
employ
a
larger
share
of
his
income
in
works
of
benevolence
one
of
the
first
public
improvements
to
which
he
devoted
himself
was
that
of
the
highways
of
the
metropolis
in
which
he
succeeded
to
a
large
extent
the
rumour
of
a
french
invasion
being
prevalent
in
hanway
turned
his
attention
to
the
best
mode
of
keeping
up
the
supply
of
seamen
he
summoned
a
meeting
of
merchants
and
shipowners
at
the
royal
exchange
and
there
proposed
to
them
to
form
themselves
into
a
society
for
fitting
out
landsmen
volunteers
and
boys
to
serve
on
board
the
king
s
ships
the
proposal
was
received
with
enthusiasm
a
society
was
formed
and
officers
were
appointed
hanway
directing
its
entire
operations
the
result
was
the
establishment
in
of
the
marine
society
an
institution
which
has
proved
of
much
national
advantage
and
is
to
this
day
of
great
and
substantial
utility
within
six
years
from
its
formation
boys
and
landsmen
volunteers
had
been
trained
and
fitted
out
by
the
society
and
added
to
the
navy
and
to
this
day
it
is
in
active
operation
about
poor
boys
after
a
careful
education
being
annually
apprenticed
as
sailors
principally
in
the
merchant
service
hanway
devoted
the
other
portions
of
his
spare
time
to
improving
or
establishing
important
public
institutions
in
the
metropolis
from
an
early
period
he
took
an
active
interest
in
the
foundling
hospital
which
had
been
started
by
thomas
coram
many
years
before
but
which
by
encouraging
parents
to
abandon
their
children
to
the
charge
of
a
charity
was
threatening
to
do
more
harm
than
good
he
determined
to
take
steps
to
stem
the
evil
entering
upon
the
work
in
the
face
of
the
fashionable
philanthropy
of
the
time
but
by
holding
to
his
purpose
he
eventually
succeeded
in
bringing
the
charity
back
to
its
proper
objects
and
time
and
experience
have
proved
that
he
was
right
the
magdalen
hospital
was
also
established
in
a
great
measure
through
hanway
s
exertions
but
his
most
laborious
and
persevering
efforts
were
in
behalf
of
the
infant
parish
poor
the
misery
and
neglect
amidst
which
the
children
of
the
parish
poor
then
grew
up
and
the
mortality
which
prevailed
amongst
them
were
frightful
but
there
was
no
fashionable
movement
on
foot
to
abate
the
suffering
as
in
the
case
of
the
foundlings
so
jonas
hanway
summoned
his
energies
to
the
task
alone
and
unassisted
he
first
ascertained
by
personal
inquiry
the
extent
of
the
evil
he
explored
the
dwellings
of
the
poorest
classes
in
london
and
visited
the
poorhouse
sick
wards
by
which
he
ascertained
the
management
in
detail
of
every
workhouse
in
and
near
the
metropolis
he
next
made
a
journey
into
france
and
through
holland
visiting
the
houses
for
the
reception
of
the
poor
and
noting
whatever
he
thought
might
be
adopted
at
home
with
advantage
he
was
thus
employed
for
five
years
and
on
his
return
to
england
he
published
the
results
of
his
observations
the
consequence
was
that
many
of
the
workhouses
were
reformed
and
improved
in
he
obtained
an
act
obliging
every
london
parish
to
keep
an
annual
register
of
all
the
infants
received
discharged
and
dead
and
he
took
care
that
the
act
should
work
for
he
himself
superintended
its
working
with
indefatigable
watchfulness
he
went
about
from
workhouse
to
workhouse
in
the
morning
and
from
one
member
of
parliament
to
another
in
the
afternoon
for
day
after
day
and
for
year
after
year
enduring
every
rebuff
answering
every
objection
and
accommodating
himself
to
every
humour
at
length
after
a
perseverance
hardly
to
be
equalled
and
after
nearly
ten
years
labour
he
obtained
another
act
at
his
sole
expense
geo
iii
directing
that
all
parish
infants
belonging
to
the
parishes
within
the
bills
of
mortality
should
not
be
nursed
in
the
workhouses
but
be
sent
to
nurse
a
certain
number
of
miles
out
of
town
until
they
were
six
years
old
under
the
care
of
guardians
to
be
elected
triennially
the
poor
people
called
this
the
act
for
keeping
children
alive
and
the
registers
for
the
years
which
followed
its
passing
as
compared
with
those
which
preceded
it
showed
that
thousands
of
lives
had
been
preserved
through
the
judicious
interference
of
this
good
and
sensible
man
wherever
a
philanthropic
work
was
to
be
done
in
london
be
sure
that
jonas
hanway
s
hand
was
in
it
one
of
the
first
acts
for
the
protection
of
boys
was
obtained
through
his
influence
a
destructive
fire
at
montreal
and
another
at
bridgetown
barbadoes
afforded
him
the
opportunity
for
raising
a
timely
subscription
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
his
name
appeared
in
every
list
and
his
disinterestedness
and
sincerity
were
universally
recognized
but
he
was
not
suffered
to
waste
his
little
fortune
entirely
in
the
service
of
others
five
leading
citizens
of
london
headed
by
hoare
the
banker
without
hanway
s
knowledge
waited
on
lord
bute
then
prime
minister
in
a
body
and
in
the
names
of
their
requested
that
some
notice
might
be
taken
of
this
good
man
s
disinterested
services
to
his
country
the
result
was
his
appointment
shortly
after
as
one
of
the
commissioners
for
victualling
the
navy
towards
the
close
of
his
life
hanway
s
health
became
very
feeble
and
although
he
found
it
necessary
to
resign
his
office
at
the
victualling
board
he
could
not
be
idle
but
laboured
at
the
establishment
of
sunday
schools
movement
then
in
its
infancy
in
relieving
poor
blacks
many
of
whom
wandered
destitute
about
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
in
alleviating
the
sufferings
of
some
neglected
and
destitute
class
of
society
notwithstanding
his
familiarity
with
misery
in
all
its
shapes
he
was
one
of
the
most
cheerful
of
beings
and
but
for
his
cheerfulness
he
could
never
with
so
delicate
a
frame
have
got
through
so
vast
an
amount
of
work
he
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
inactivity
though
fragile
he
was
bold
and
indefatigable
and
his
moral
courage
was
of
the
first
order
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
trivial
matter
to
mention
that
he
was
the
first
who
ventured
to
walk
the
streets
of
london
with
an
umbrella
over
his
head
but
let
any
modern
london
merchant
venture
to
walk
along
cornhill
in
a
peaked
chinese
hat
and
he
will
find
it
takes
some
degree
of
moral
courage
to
persevere
in
it
after
carrying
an
umbrella
for
thirty
years
hanway
saw
the
article
at
length
come
into
general
use
hanway
was
a
man
of
strict
honour
truthfulness
and
integrity
and
every
word
he
said
might
be
relied
upon
he
had
so
great
a
respect
amounting
almost
to
a
reverence
for
the
character
of
the
honest
merchant
that
it
was
the
only
subject
upon
which
he
was
ever
seduced
into
a
eulogium
he
strictly
practised
what
he
professed
and
both
as
a
merchant
and
afterwards
as
a
commissioner
for
victualling
the
navy
his
conduct
was
without
stain
he
would
not
accept
the
slightest
favour
of
any
sort
from
a
contractor
and
when
any
present
was
sent
to
him
whilst
at
the
victualling
office
he
would
politely
return
it
with
the
intimation
that
he
had
made
it
a
rule
not
to
accept
anything
from
any
person
engaged
with
the
when
he
found
his
powers
failing
he
prepared
for
death
with
as
much
cheerfulness
as
he
would
have
prepared
himself
for
a
journey
into
the
country
he
sent
round
and
paid
all
his
tradesmen
took
leave
of
his
friends
arranged
his
affairs
had
his
person
neatly
disposed
of
and
parted
with
life
serenely
and
peacefully
in
his
year
the
property
which
he
left
did
not
amount
to
two
thousand
pounds
and
as
he
had
no
relatives
who
wanted
it
he
divided
it
amongst
sundry
orphans
and
poor
persons
whom
he
had
befriended
during
his
lifetime
such
in
brief
was
the
beautiful
life
of
jonas
hanway
honest
energetic
and
a
man
as
ever
lived
the
life
of
granville
sharp
is
another
striking
example
of
the
same
power
of
individual
power
which
was
afterwards
transfused
into
the
noble
band
of
workers
in
the
cause
of
slavery
abolition
prominent
among
whom
were
clarkson
wilberforce
buxton
and
brougham
but
giants
though
these
men
were
in
this
cause
granville
sharp
was
the
first
and
perhaps
the
greatest
of
them
all
in
point
of
perseverance
energy
and
intrepidity
he
began
life
as
apprentice
to
a
on
tower
hill
but
leaving
that
business
after
his
apprenticeship
was
out
he
next
entered
as
a
clerk
in
the
ordnance
office
and
it
was
while
engaged
in
that
humble
occupation
that
he
carried
on
in
his
spare
hours
the
work
of
negro
emancipation
he
was
always
even
when
an
apprentice
ready
to
undertake
any
amount
of
volunteer
labour
where
a
useful
purpose
was
to
be
served
thus
while
learning
the
business
a
fellow
apprentice
who
lodged
in
the
same
house
and
was
a
unitarian
led
him
into
frequent
discussions
on
religious
subjects
the
unitarian
youth
insisted
that
granville
s
trinitarian
misconception
of
certain
passages
of
scripture
arose
from
his
want
of
acquaintance
with
the
greek
tongue
on
which
he
immediately
set
to
work
in
his
evening
hours
and
shortly
acquired
an
intimate
knowledge
of
greek
a
similar
controversy
with
another
a
jew
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
prophecies
led
him
in
like
manner
to
undertake
and
overcome
the
difficulties
of
hebrew
but
the
circumstance
which
gave
the
bias
and
direction
to
the
main
labours
of
his
life
originated
in
his
generosity
and
benevolence
his
brother
william
a
surgeon
in
mincing
lane
gave
gratuitous
advice
to
the
poor
and
amongst
the
numerous
applicants
for
relief
at
his
surgery
was
a
poor
african
named
jonathan
strong
it
appeared
that
the
negro
had
been
brutally
treated
by
his
master
a
barbadoes
lawyer
then
in
london
and
became
lame
almost
blind
and
unable
to
work
on
which
his
owner
regarding
him
as
of
no
further
value
as
a
chattel
cruelly
turned
him
adrift
into
the
streets
to
starve
this
poor
man
a
mass
of
disease
supported
himself
by
begging
for
a
time
until
he
found
his
way
to
william
sharp
who
gave
him
some
medicine
and
shortly
after
got
him
admitted
to
bartholomew
s
hospital
where
he
was
cured
on
coming
out
of
the
hospital
the
two
brothers
supported
the
negro
in
order
to
keep
him
off
the
streets
but
they
had
not
the
least
suspicion
at
the
time
that
any
one
had
a
claim
upon
his
person
they
even
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
situation
for
strong
with
an
apothecary
in
whose
service
he
remained
for
two
years
and
it
was
while
he
was
attending
his
mistress
behind
a
hackney
coach
that
his
former
owner
the
barbadoes
lawyer
recognized
him
and
determined
to
recover
possession
of
the
slave
again
rendered
valuable
by
the
restoration
of
his
health
the
lawyer
employed
two
of
the
lord
mayor
s
officers
to
apprehend
strong
and
he
was
lodged
in
the
compter
until
he
could
be
shipped
off
to
the
west
indies
the
negro
bethinking
him
in
his
captivity
of
the
kind
services
which
granville
sharp
had
rendered
him
in
his
great
distress
some
years
before
despatched
a
letter
to
him
requesting
his
help
sharp
had
forgotten
the
name
of
strong
but
he
sent
a
messenger
to
make
inquiries
who
returned
saying
that
the
keepers
denied
having
any
such
person
in
their
charge
his
suspicions
were
roused
and
he
went
forthwith
to
the
prison
and
insisted
upon
seeing
jonathan
strong
he
was
admitted
and
recognized
the
poor
negro
now
in
custody
as
a
recaptured
slave
sharp
charged
the
master
of
the
prison
at
his
own
peril
not
to
deliver
up
strong
to
any
person
whatever
until
he
had
been
carried
before
the
lord
mayor
to
whom
sharp
immediately
went
and
obtained
a
summons
against
those
persons
who
had
seized
and
imprisoned
strong
without
a
warrant
the
parties
appeared
before
the
lord
mayor
accordingly
and
it
appeared
from
the
proceedings
that
strong
s
former
master
had
already
sold
him
to
a
new
one
who
produced
the
bill
of
sale
and
claimed
the
negro
as
his
property
as
no
charge
of
offence
was
made
against
strong
and
as
the
lord
mayor
was
incompetent
to
deal
with
the
legal
question
of
strong
s
liberty
or
otherwise
he
discharged
him
and
the
slave
followed
his
benefactor
out
of
court
no
one
daring
to
touch
him
the
man
s
owner
immediately
gave
sharp
notice
of
an
action
to
recover
possession
of
his
negro
slave
of
whom
he
declared
he
had
been
robbed
about
that
time
the
personal
liberty
of
the
englishman
though
cherished
as
a
theory
was
subject
to
grievous
infringements
and
was
almost
daily
violated
the
impressment
of
men
for
the
sea
service
was
constantly
practised
and
besides
the
there
were
regular
bands
of
kidnappers
employed
in
london
and
all
the
large
towns
of
the
kingdom
to
seize
men
for
the
east
india
company
s
service
and
when
the
men
were
not
wanted
for
india
they
were
shipped
off
to
the
planters
in
the
american
colonies
negro
slaves
were
openly
advertised
for
sale
in
the
london
and
liverpool
newspapers
rewards
were
offered
for
recovering
and
securing
fugitive
slaves
and
conveying
them
down
to
certain
specified
ships
in
the
river
the
position
of
the
reputed
slave
in
england
was
undefined
and
doubtful
the
judgments
which
had
been
given
in
the
courts
of
law
were
fluctuating
and
various
resting
on
no
settled
principle
although
it
was
a
popular
belief
that
no
slave
could
breathe
in
england
there
were
legal
men
of
eminence
who
expressed
a
directly
contrary
opinion
the
lawyers
to
whom
sharp
resorted
for
advice
in
defending
himself
in
the
action
raised
against
him
in
the
case
of
jonathan
strong
generally
concurred
in
this
view
and
he
was
further
told
by
jonathan
strong
s
owner
that
the
eminent
lord
chief
justice
mansfield
and
all
the
leading
counsel
were
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
slave
by
coming
into
england
did
not
become
free
but
might
legally
be
compelled
to
return
again
to
the
plantations
such
information
would
have
caused
despair
in
a
mind
less
courageous
and
earnest
than
that
of
granville
sharp
but
it
only
served
to
stimulate
his
resolution
to
fight
the
battle
of
the
negroes
freedom
at
least
in
england
forsaken
he
said
by
my
professional
defenders
i
was
compelled
through
the
want
of
regular
legal
assistance
to
make
a
hopeless
attempt
at
though
i
was
totally
unacquainted
either
with
the
practice
of
the
law
or
the
foundations
of
it
having
never
opened
a
law
book
except
the
bible
in
my
life
until
that
time
when
i
most
reluctantly
undertook
to
search
the
indexes
of
a
law
library
which
my
bookseller
had
lately
the
whole
of
his
time
during
the
day
was
occupied
with
the
business
of
the
ordnance
department
where
he
held
the
most
laborious
post
in
the
office
he
was
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
conducting
his
new
studies
late
at
night
or
early
in
the
morning
he
confessed
that
he
was
himself
becoming
a
sort
of
slave
writing
to
a
clerical
friend
to
excuse
himself
for
delay
in
replying
to
a
letter
he
said
i
profess
myself
entirely
incapable
of
holding
a
literary
correspondence
what
little
time
i
have
been
able
to
save
from
sleep
at
night
and
early
in
the
morning
has
been
necessarily
employed
in
the
examination
of
some
points
of
law
which
admitted
of
no
delay
and
yet
required
the
most
diligent
researches
and
examination
in
my
sharp
gave
up
every
leisure
moment
that
he
could
command
during
the
next
two
years
to
the
close
study
of
the
laws
of
england
affecting
personal
liberty
through
an
immense
mass
of
dry
and
repulsive
literature
and
making
extracts
of
all
the
most
important
acts
of
parliament
decisions
of
the
courts
and
opinions
of
eminent
lawyers
as
he
went
along
in
this
tedious
and
protracted
inquiry
he
had
no
instructor
nor
assistant
nor
adviser
he
could
not
find
a
single
lawyer
whose
opinion
was
favourable
to
his
undertaking
the
results
of
his
inquiries
were
however
as
gratifying
to
himself
as
they
were
surprising
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
law
god
be
thanked
he
wrote
there
is
nothing
in
any
english
law
or
least
that
i
am
able
to
find
can
justify
the
enslaving
of
he
had
planted
his
foot
firm
and
now
he
doubted
nothing
he
drew
up
the
result
of
his
studies
in
a
summary
form
it
was
a
plain
clear
and
manly
statement
entitled
on
the
injustice
of
tolerating
slavery
in
england
and
numerous
copies
made
by
himself
were
circulated
by
him
amongst
the
most
eminent
lawyers
of
the
time
strong
s
owner
finding
the
sort
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with
invented
various
pretexts
for
deferring
the
suit
against
sharp
and
at
length
offered
a
compromise
which
was
rejected
granville
went
on
circulating
his
manuscript
tract
among
the
lawyers
until
at
length
those
employed
against
jonathan
strong
were
deterred
from
proceeding
further
and
the
result
was
that
the
plaintiff
was
compelled
to
pay
treble
costs
for
not
bringing
forward
his
action
the
tract
was
then
printed
in
in
the
mean
time
other
cases
occurred
of
the
kidnapping
of
negroes
in
london
and
their
shipment
to
the
west
indies
for
sale
wherever
sharp
could
lay
hold
of
any
such
case
he
at
once
took
proceedings
to
rescue
the
negro
thus
the
wife
of
one
hylas
an
african
was
seized
and
despatched
to
barbadoes
on
which
sharp
in
the
name
of
hylas
instituted
legal
proceedings
against
the
aggressor
obtained
a
verdict
with
damages
and
hylas
s
wife
was
brought
back
to
england
free
another
forcible
capture
of
a
negro
attended
with
great
cruelty
having
occurred
in
he
immediately
set
himself
on
the
track
of
the
aggressors
an
african
named
lewis
was
seized
one
dark
night
by
two
watermen
employed
by
the
person
who
claimed
the
negro
as
his
property
dragged
into
the
water
hoisted
into
a
boat
where
he
was
gagged
and
his
limbs
were
tied
and
then
rowing
down
river
they
put
him
on
board
a
ship
bound
for
jamaica
where
he
was
to
be
sold
for
a
slave
upon
his
arrival
in
the
island
the
cries
of
the
poor
negro
had
however
attracted
the
attention
of
some
neighbours
one
of
whom
proceeded
direct
to
granville
sharp
now
known
as
the
negro
s
friend
and
informed
him
of
the
outrage
sharp
immediately
got
a
warrant
to
bring
back
lewis
and
he
proceeded
to
gravesend
but
on
arrival
there
the
ship
had
sailed
for
the
downs
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
obtained
sent
down
to
spithead
and
before
the
ship
could
leave
the
shores
of
england
the
writ
was
served
the
slave
was
found
chained
to
the
bathed
in
tears
casting
mournful
looks
on
the
land
from
which
he
was
about
to
be
torn
he
was
immediately
liberated
brought
back
to
london
and
a
warrant
was
issued
against
the
author
of
the
outrage
the
promptitude
of
head
heart
and
hand
displayed
by
sharp
in
this
transaction
could
scarcely
have
been
surpassed
and
yet
he
accused
himself
of
slowness
the
case
was
tried
before
lord
opinion
it
will
be
remembered
had
already
been
expressed
as
decidedly
opposed
to
that
entertained
by
granville
sharp
the
judge
however
avoided
bringing
the
question
to
an
issue
or
offering
any
opinion
on
the
legal
question
as
to
the
slave
s
personal
liberty
or
otherwise
but
discharged
the
negro
because
the
defendant
could
bring
no
evidence
that
lewis
was
even
nominally
his
property
the
question
of
the
personal
liberty
of
the
negro
in
england
was
therefore
still
undecided
but
in
the
mean
time
sharp
continued
steady
in
his
benevolent
course
and
by
his
indefatigable
exertions
and
promptitude
of
action
many
more
were
added
to
the
list
of
the
rescued
at
length
the
important
case
of
james
somerset
occurred
a
case
which
is
said
to
have
been
selected
at
the
mutual
desire
of
lord
mansfield
and
sharp
in
order
to
bring
the
great
question
involved
to
a
clear
legal
issue
somerset
had
been
brought
to
england
by
his
master
and
left
there
afterwards
his
master
sought
to
apprehend
him
and
send
him
off
to
jamaica
for
sale
sharp
as
usual
at
once
took
the
negro
s
case
in
hand
and
employed
counsel
to
defend
him
lord
mansfield
intimated
that
the
case
was
of
such
general
concern
that
he
should
take
the
opinion
of
all
the
judges
upon
it
sharp
now
felt
that
he
would
have
to
contend
with
all
the
force
that
could
be
brought
against
him
but
his
resolution
was
in
no
wise
shaken
fortunately
for
him
in
this
severe
struggle
his
exertions
had
already
begun
to
tell
increasing
interest
was
taken
in
the
question
and
many
eminent
legal
gentlemen
openly
declared
themselves
to
be
upon
his
side
the
cause
of
personal
liberty
now
at
stake
was
fairly
tried
before
lord
mansfield
assisted
by
the
three
justices
tried
on
the
broad
principle
of
the
essential
and
constitutional
right
of
every
man
in
england
to
the
liberty
of
his
person
unless
forfeited
by
the
law
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
enter
into
any
account
of
this
great
trial
the
arguments
extended
to
a
great
length
the
cause
being
carried
over
to
another
term
it
was
adjourned
and
at
length
judgment
was
given
by
lord
mansfield
in
whose
powerful
mind
so
gradual
a
change
had
been
worked
by
the
arguments
of
counsel
based
mainly
on
granville
sharp
s
tract
that
he
now
declared
the
court
to
be
so
clearly
of
one
opinion
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
referring
the
case
to
the
twelve
judges
he
then
declared
that
the
claim
of
slavery
never
can
be
supported
that
the
power
claimed
never
was
in
use
in
england
nor
acknowledged
by
the
law
therefore
the
man
james
somerset
must
be
discharged
by
securing
this
judgment
granville
sharp
effectually
abolished
the
slave
trade
until
then
carried
on
openly
in
the
streets
of
liverpool
and
london
but
he
also
firmly
established
the
glorious
axiom
that
as
soon
as
any
slave
sets
his
foot
on
english
ground
that
moment
he
becomes
free
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
great
decision
of
lord
mansfield
was
mainly
owing
to
sharp
s
firm
resolute
and
intrepid
prosecution
of
the
cause
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
it
is
unnecessary
further
to
follow
the
career
of
granville
sharp
he
continued
to
labour
indefatigably
in
all
good
works
he
was
instrumental
in
founding
the
colony
of
sierra
leone
as
an
asylum
for
rescued
negroes
he
laboured
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
native
indians
in
the
american
colonies
he
agitated
the
enlargement
and
extension
of
the
political
rights
of
the
english
people
and
he
endeavoured
to
effect
the
abolition
of
the
impressment
of
seamen
granville
held
that
the
british
seamen
as
well
as
the
african
negro
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
law
and
that
the
fact
of
his
choosing
a
seafaring
life
did
not
in
any
way
cancel
his
rights
and
privileges
as
an
amongst
which
he
ranked
personal
freedom
sharp
also
laboured
but
ineffectually
to
restore
amity
between
england
and
her
colonies
in
america
and
when
the
fratricidal
war
of
the
american
revolution
was
entered
on
his
sense
of
integrity
was
so
scrupulous
that
resolving
not
in
any
way
to
be
concerned
in
so
unnatural
a
business
he
resigned
his
situation
at
the
ordnance
office
to
the
last
he
held
to
the
great
object
of
his
abolition
of
slavery
to
carry
on
this
work
and
organize
the
efforts
of
the
growing
friends
of
the
cause
the
society
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
founded
and
new
men
inspired
by
sharp
s
example
and
zeal
sprang
forward
to
help
him
his
energy
became
theirs
and
the
zeal
in
which
he
had
so
long
laboured
became
at
length
transfused
into
the
nation
itself
his
mantle
fell
upon
clarkson
upon
wilberforce
upon
brougham
and
upon
buxton
who
laboured
as
he
had
done
with
like
energy
and
stedfastness
of
purpose
until
at
length
slavery
was
abolished
throughout
the
british
dominions
but
though
the
names
last
mentioned
may
be
more
frequently
identified
with
the
triumph
of
this
great
cause
the
chief
merit
unquestionably
belongs
to
granville
sharp
he
was
encouraged
by
none
of
the
world
s
huzzas
when
he
entered
upon
his
work
he
stood
alone
opposed
to
the
opinion
of
the
ablest
lawyers
and
the
most
rooted
prejudices
of
the
times
and
alone
he
fought
out
by
his
single
exertions
and
at
his
individual
expense
the
most
memorable
battle
for
the
constitution
of
this
country
and
the
liberties
of
british
subjects
of
which
modern
times
afford
a
record
what
followed
was
mainly
the
consequence
of
his
indefatigable
constancy
he
lighted
the
torch
which
kindled
other
minds
and
it
was
handed
on
until
the
illumination
became
complete
before
the
death
of
granville
sharp
clarkson
had
already
turned
his
attention
to
the
question
of
negro
slavery
he
had
even
selected
it
for
the
subject
of
a
college
essay
and
his
mind
became
so
possessed
by
it
that
he
could
not
shake
it
off
the
spot
is
pointed
out
near
wade
s
mill
in
hertfordshire
where
alighting
from
his
horse
one
day
he
sat
down
disconsolate
on
the
turf
by
the
road
side
and
after
long
thinking
determined
to
devote
himself
wholly
to
the
work
he
translated
his
essay
from
latin
into
english
added
fresh
illustrations
and
published
it
then
fellow
labourers
gathered
round
him
the
society
for
abolishing
the
slave
trade
unknown
to
him
had
already
been
formed
and
when
he
heard
of
it
he
joined
it
he
sacrificed
all
his
prospects
in
life
to
prosecute
this
cause
wilberforce
was
selected
to
lead
in
parliament
but
upon
clarkson
chiefly
devolved
the
labour
of
collecting
and
arranging
the
immense
mass
of
evidence
offered
in
support
of
the
abolition
a
remarkable
instance
of
clarkson
s
sort
of
perseverance
may
be
mentioned
the
abettors
of
slavery
in
the
course
of
their
defence
of
the
system
maintained
that
only
such
negroes
as
were
captured
in
battle
were
sold
as
slaves
and
if
not
so
sold
then
they
were
reserved
for
a
still
more
frightful
doom
in
their
own
country
clarkson
knew
of
the
conducted
by
the
but
had
no
witnesses
to
prove
it
where
was
one
to
be
found
accidentally
a
gentleman
whom
he
met
on
one
of
his
journeys
informed
him
of
a
young
sailor
in
whose
company
he
had
been
about
a
year
before
who
had
been
actually
engaged
in
one
of
such
expeditions
the
gentleman
did
not
know
his
name
and
could
but
indefinitely
describe
his
person
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
further
than
that
he
belonged
to
a
ship
of
war
in
ordinary
but
at
what
port
he
could
not
tell
with
this
mere
glimmering
of
information
clarkson
determined
to
produce
this
man
as
a
witness
he
visited
personally
all
the
seaport
towns
where
ships
in
ordinary
lay
boarded
and
examined
every
ship
without
success
until
he
came
to
the
very
port
and
found
the
young
man
his
prize
in
the
very
ship
that
remained
to
be
visited
the
young
man
proved
to
be
one
of
his
most
valuable
and
effective
witnesses
during
several
years
clarkson
conducted
a
correspondence
with
upwards
of
four
hundred
persons
travelling
more
than
thousand
miles
during
the
same
time
in
search
of
evidence
he
was
at
length
disabled
and
exhausted
by
illness
brought
on
by
his
continuous
exertions
but
he
was
not
borne
from
the
field
until
his
zeal
had
fully
awakened
the
public
mind
and
excited
the
ardent
sympathies
of
all
good
men
on
behalf
of
the
slave
after
years
of
protracted
struggle
the
slave
trade
was
abolished
but
still
another
great
achievement
remained
to
be
abolition
of
slavery
itself
throughout
the
british
dominions
and
here
again
determined
energy
won
the
day
of
the
leaders
in
the
cause
none
was
more
distinguished
than
fowell
buxton
who
took
the
position
formerly
occupied
by
wilberforce
in
the
house
of
commons
buxton
was
a
dull
heavy
boy
distinguished
for
his
strong
which
first
exhibited
itself
in
violent
domineering
and
headstrong
obstinacy
his
father
died
when
he
was
a
child
but
fortunately
he
had
a
wise
mother
who
trained
his
will
with
great
care
constraining
him
to
obey
but
encouraging
the
habit
of
deciding
and
acting
for
himself
in
matters
which
might
safely
be
left
to
him
his
mother
believed
that
a
strong
will
directed
upon
worthy
objects
was
a
valuable
manly
quality
if
properly
guided
and
she
acted
accordingly
when
others
about
her
commented
on
the
boy
s
she
would
merely
say
never
is
will
see
it
will
turn
out
well
in
the
fowell
learnt
very
little
at
school
and
was
regarded
as
a
dunce
and
an
idler
he
got
other
boys
to
do
his
exercises
for
him
while
he
romped
and
scrambled
about
he
returned
home
at
fifteen
a
great
growing
awkward
lad
fond
only
of
boating
shooting
riding
and
field
sports
his
time
principally
with
the
gamekeeper
a
man
possessed
of
a
good
heart
intelligent
observer
of
life
and
nature
though
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
buxton
had
excellent
raw
material
in
him
but
he
wanted
culture
training
and
development
at
this
juncture
of
his
life
when
his
habits
were
being
formed
for
good
or
evil
he
was
happily
thrown
into
the
society
of
the
gurney
family
distinguished
for
their
fine
social
qualities
not
less
than
for
their
intellectual
culture
and
philanthropy
this
intercourse
with
the
gurneys
he
used
afterwards
to
say
gave
the
colouring
to
his
life
they
encouraged
his
efforts
at
and
when
he
went
to
the
university
of
dublin
and
gained
high
honours
there
the
animating
passion
in
his
mind
he
said
was
to
carry
back
to
them
the
prizes
which
they
prompted
and
enabled
me
to
he
married
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
family
and
started
in
life
commencing
as
a
clerk
to
his
uncles
hanbury
the
london
brewers
his
power
of
will
which
made
him
so
difficult
to
deal
with
as
a
boy
now
formed
the
backbone
of
his
character
and
made
him
most
indefatigable
and
energetic
in
whatever
he
undertook
he
threw
his
whole
strength
and
bulk
right
down
upon
his
work
and
the
great
elephant
buxton
they
called
him
for
he
stood
some
six
feet
four
in
one
of
the
most
vigorous
and
practical
of
men
i
could
brew

said
one
hour
mathematics
the
next
shoot
the
next
each
with
my
whole
there
was
invincible
energy
and
determination
in
whatever
he
did
admitted
a
partner
he
became
the
active
manager
of
the
concern
and
the
vast
business
which
he
conducted
felt
his
influence
through
every
fibre
and
prospered
far
beyond
its
previous
success
nor
did
he
allow
his
mind
to
lie
fallow
for
he
gave
his
evenings
diligently
to
studying
and
digesting
blackstone
montesquieu
and
solid
commentaries
on
english
law
his
maxims
in
reading
were
never
to
begin
a
book
without
finishing
it
never
to
consider
a
book
finished
until
it
is
mastered
and
to
study
everything
with
the
whole
when
only
buxton
entered
parliament
and
at
once
assumed
that
position
of
influence
there
of
which
every
honest
earnest
man
is
secure
who
enters
that
assembly
of
the
first
gentlemen
in
the
world
the
principal
question
to
which
he
devoted
himself
was
the
complete
emancipation
of
the
slaves
in
the
british
colonies
he
himself
used
to
attribute
the
interest
which
he
early
felt
in
this
question
to
the
influence
of
priscilla
gurney
one
of
the
earlham
family
woman
of
a
fine
intellect
and
warm
heart
abounding
in
illustrious
virtues
when
on
her
deathbed
in
she
repeatedly
sent
for
buxton
and
urged
him
to
make
the
cause
of
the
slaves
the
great
object
of
his
her
last
act
was
to
attempt
to
reiterate
the
solemn
charge
and
she
expired
in
the
ineffectual
effort
buxton
never
forgot
her
counsel
he
named
one
of
his
daughters
after
her
and
on
the
day
on
which
she
was
married
from
his
house
on
the
of
august
day
of
negro
his
priscilla
had
been
manumitted
from
her
filial
service
and
left
her
father
s
home
in
the
company
of
her
husband
buxton
sat
down
and
thus
wrote
to
a
friend
the
bride
is
just
gone
everything
has
passed
off
to
admiration
and
is
not
a
slave
in
the
british
buxton
was
no
a
great
intellectual
leader
nor
discoverer
but
mainly
an
earnest
straightforward
resolute
energetic
man
indeed
his
whole
character
is
most
forcibly
expressed
in
his
own
words
which
every
young
man
might
well
stamp
upon
his
soul
the
longer
i
live
said
he
the
more
i
am
certain
that
the
great
difference
between
men
between
the
feeble
and
the
powerful
the
great
and
the
insignificant
is
purpose
once
fixed
and
then
death
or
victory
that
quality
will
do
anything
that
can
be
done
in
this
world
and
no
talents
no
circumstances
no
opportunities
will
make
a
creature
a
man
without
chapter
ix
men
of
business
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
he
shall
stand
before
of
that
man
is
but
of
the
lower
part
of
the
world
that
is
not
brought
up
to
business
and
hazlitt
in
one
of
his
clever
essays
represents
the
man
of
business
as
a
mean
sort
of
person
put
in
a
yoked
to
a
trade
or
profession
alleging
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
not
to
go
out
of
the
beaten
track
but
merely
to
let
his
affairs
take
their
own
course
the
great
requisite
he
says
for
the
prosperous
management
of
ordinary
business
is
the
want
of
imagination
or
of
any
ideas
but
those
of
custom
and
interest
on
the
narrowest
but
nothing
could
be
more
and
in
effect
untrue
than
such
a
definition
of
course
there
are
men
of
business
as
there
are
scientific
men
literary
men
and
legislators
but
there
are
also
business
men
of
large
and
comprehensive
minds
capable
of
action
on
the
very
largest
scale
as
burke
said
in
his
speech
on
the
india
bill
he
knew
statesmen
who
were
pedlers
and
merchants
who
acted
in
the
spirit
of
statesmen
if
we
take
into
account
the
qualities
necessary
for
the
successful
conduct
of
any
important
undertaking
it
requires
special
aptitude
promptitude
of
action
on
emergencies
capacity
for
organizing
the
labours
often
of
large
numbers
of
men
great
tact
and
knowledge
of
human
nature
constant
and
growing
experience
in
the
practical
affairs
of
life
must
we
think
be
obvious
that
the
school
of
business
is
by
no
means
so
narrow
as
some
writers
would
have
us
believe
mr
helps
had
gone
much
nearer
the
truth
when
he
said
that
consummate
men
of
business
are
as
rare
almost
as
great
poets
perhaps
than
veritable
saints
and
martyrs
indeed
of
no
other
pursuit
can
it
so
emphatically
be
said
as
of
this
that
business
makes
it
has
however
been
a
favourite
fallacy
with
dunces
in
all
times
that
men
of
genius
are
unfitted
for
business
as
well
as
that
business
occupations
unfit
men
for
the
pursuits
of
genius
the
unhappy
youth
who
committed
suicide
a
few
years
since
because
he
had
been
born
to
be
a
man
and
condemned
to
be
a
grocer
proved
by
the
act
that
his
soul
was
not
equal
even
to
the
dignity
of
grocery
for
it
is
not
the
calling
that
degrades
the
man
but
the
man
that
degrades
the
calling
all
work
that
brings
honest
gain
is
honourable
whether
it
be
of
hand
or

the
fingers
may
be
soiled
yet
the

remain
pure
for
it
is
not
material
so
much
as

far
more

capacity

pope
was
of
opinion
that
shakespeare
s
principal
object
in
cultivating
literature
was
to
secure
an
honest
independence
indeed
he

to
have
been
altogether
indifferent

it
is
not

that
he

publication

the
chronology

still
a
mystery
it
is
certain
however
that
he

carrying
with
him
the
admiration
and

of

because
of
the

the

bacon
was
accustomed
to
say
that
it
was
in

as
in

was
commonly
the
foulest
and
that
if
a
man
would
go
the
fairest
way
he
must
go
somewhat
about
the
journey
may
occupy
a
longer

but
the
pleasure
of
the

involved
by
it
and
the
enjoyment
of
the
results
produced
will
be
more
genuine

unalloyed
to
have
a

appointed
task

even
common

to

the

the

the

of
the

of

is
the
type
of
all

every
youth
should
be
made
to
feel
that
his
happiness
and
in

must
necessarily
rely
mainly
on
himself

his

the
late
lord
melbourne
embodied
a
piece
of
useful
advice
in
a
letter
which
he
wrote
to
lord
john
russell
in
reply
to
an
application
for
a
provision
for
one
of
moore
the
poet
s
sons
my
dear
john
he
said
i
return
you
moore
s
letter
i
shall
be
ready
to
do
what
you
like
about
it
when
we
have
the
means
i
think
whatever
is
done
should
be
done
for
moore
himself
this
is
more
distinct
direct
and
intelligible
making
a
small
provision
for
young
men
is
hardly
justifiable
and
it
is
of
all
things
the
most
prejudicial
to
themselves
they
think
what
they
have
much
larger
than
it
really
is
and
they
make
no
exertion
the
young
should
never
hear
any
language
but
this
you
have
your
own
way
to
make
and
it
depends
upon
your
own
exertions
whether
you
starve
or
believe
me
practical
industry
wisely
and
vigorously
applied
always
produces
its
due
effects
it
carries
a
man
onward

out
his
individual
character
and
stimulates
the
action
of
others
all
may
not
rise
equally
yet
each
on
the
whole
very
much
according
to
his
deserts
though
all
can
not
live
on
the
piazza
as
the
tuscan
proverb
has
it
every
one
may
feel
the
on
the
whole
it
is
not
good
that
human
nature
should
have
the
road
of
life
made
too
easy
better
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
working
hard
and
faring
meanly
than
to
have
everything
done
ready
to
our
hand
and
a
pillow
of
down
to
repose
upon
indeed
to
start
in
life
with
comparatively
small
means
seems
so
necessary
as
a
stimulus
to
work
that
it
may
almost
be
set
down
as
one
of
the
conditions
essential
to

in

an
eminent
judge
when

connexions
some
by

we
have
heard
of
an
architect
of
considerable
accomplishments
man
who
had
improved
himself
by
long
study
and
travel
in
the
classical
lands
of
the
east
came
home
to
commence
the
practice
of
his
profession
he
determined
to
begin
anywhere
provided
he
could
be
employed
and
he
accordingly
undertook
a
business
connected
with
dilapidations
of
the
lowest
and
least
remunerative
departments
of
the
architect
s
calling
but
he
had
the
good
sense
not
to
be
above
his
trade
and
he
had
the
resolution
to
work
his
way
upward
so
that
he
only
got
a
fair
start
one
hot
day
in
july
a
friend
found
him
sitting
astride
of
a
house
roof
occupied
with
his
dilapidation
business
drawing
his
hand
across
his
perspiring
countenance
he
exclaimed
here
s
a
pretty
business
for
a
man
who
has
been
all
over
greece
however
he
did
his
work
such
as
it
was
thoroughly
and
well
he
persevered
until
he
advanced
by
degrees
to
more
remunerative
branches
of
employment
and
eventually
he
rose
to
the
highest
walks
of
his
profession
the
necessity
of
labour
may
indeed
be
regarded
as
the
main
root
and
spring
of
all
that
we
call
progress
in
individuals
and
civilization
in
nations
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
heavier
curse
could
be
imposed
on
man
than
the
complete
gratification
of
all
his
wishes
without
effort
on
his
part
leaving
nothing
for
his
hopes
desires
or
struggles
the
feeling
that
life
is
destitute
of
any
motive
or
necessity
for
action
must
be
of
all
others
the
most
distressing
and
insupportable
to
a
rational
being
the
marquis
de
spinola
asking
sir
horace
vere
what
his
brother
died
of
sir
horace
replied
he
died
sir
of
having
nothing
to
alas
said
spinola
that
is
enough
to
kill
any
general
of
us
those
who
fail
in
life
are
however
very
apt
to
assume
a
tone
of
injured
innocence
and
conclude
too
hastily
that
everybody
excepting
themselves
has
had
a
hand
in
their
personal
misfortunes
an
eminent
writer
lately
published
a
book
in
which
he
described
his
numerous
failures
in
business
naively
admitting
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
multiplication
table
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
real
cause
of
his
in
life
was
the
spirit
of
the
age
lamartine
also
did
not
hesitate
to
profess
his
contempt
for
arithmetic
but
had
it
been
less
probably
we
should
not
have
witnessed
the
unseemly
spectacle
of
the
admirers
of
that
distinguished
personage
engaged
in
collecting
subscriptions
for
his
support
in
his
old
age
again
some
consider
themselves
born
to
ill
luck
and
make
up
their
minds
that
the
world
invariably
goes
against
them
without
any
fault
on
their
own
part
we
have
heard
of
a
person
of
this
sort
who
went
so
far
as
to
declare
his
belief
that
if
he
had
been
a
hatter
people
would
have
been
born
without
heads
there
is
however
a
russian
proverb
which
says
that
misfortune
is
next
door
to
stupidity
and
it
will
often
be
found
that
men
who
are
constantly
lamenting
their
luck
are
in
some
way
or
other
reaping
the
consequences
of
their
own
neglect
mismanagement
improvidence
or
want
of
application
johnson
who
came
up
to
london
with
a
single
guinea
in
his
pocket
and
who
once
accurately
described
himself
in
his
signature
to
a
letter
addressed
to
a
noble
lord
as
or
dinnerless
has
honestly
said
all
the
complaints
which
are
made
of
the
world
are
unjust
i
never
knew
a
man
of
merit
neglected
it
was
generally
by
his
own
fault
that
he
failed
of
washington
irying
the
american
author
held
like
views
as
for
the
talk
said
he
about
modest
merit
being
neglected
it
is
too
often
a
cant
by
which
indolent
and
irresolute
men
seek
to
lay
their
want
of
success
at
the
door
of
the
public
modest
merit
is
however
too
apt
to
be
inactive
or
negligent
or
uninstructed
merit
well
matured
and
well
disciplined
talent
is
always
sure
of
a
market
provided
it
exerts
itself
but
it
must
not
cower
at
home
and
expect
to
be
sought
for
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cant
too
about
the
success
of
forward
and
impudent
men
while
men
of
retiring
worth
are
passed
over
with
neglect
but
it
usually
happens
that
those
forward
men
have
that
valuable
quality
of
promptness
and
activity
without
which
worth
is
a
mere
inoperative
property
a
barking
dog
is
often
more
useful
than
a
sleeping
attention
application
accuracy
method
punctuality
and
despatch
are
the
principal
qualities
required
for
the
efficient
conduct
of
business
of
any
sort
these
at
first
sight
may
appear
to
be
small
matters
and
yet
they
are
of
essential
importance
to
human
happiness
and
usefulness
they
are
little
things
it
is
true
but
human
life
is
made
up
of
comparative
trifles
it
is
the
repetition
of
little
acts
which
constitute
not
only
the
sum
of
human
character
but
which
determine
the
character
of
nations
and
where
men
or
nations
have
broken
down
it
will
almost
invariably
be
found
that
neglect
of
little
things
was
the
rock
on
which
they
split
every
human
being
has
duties
to
be
performed
and
therefore
has
need
of
cultivating
the
capacity
for
doing
them
whether
the
sphere
of
action
be
the
management
of
a
household
the
conduct
of
a
trade
or
profession
or
the
government
of
a
nation
the
examples
we
have
already
given
of
great
workers
in
various
branches
of
industry
art
and
science
render
it
unnecessary
further
to
enforce
the
importance
of
persevering
application
in
any
department
of
life
it
is
the
result
of
experience
that
steady
attention
to
matters
of
detail
lies
at
the
root
of
human
progress
and
that
diligence
above
all
is
the
mother
of
good
luck
accuracy
is
also
of
much
importance
and
an
invariable
mark
of
good
training
in
a
man
accuracy
in
observation
accuracy
in
speech
accuracy
in
the
transaction
of
affairs
what
is
done
in
business
must
be
well
done
for
it
is
better
to
accomplish
perfectly
a
small
amount
of
work
than
to
ten
times
as
much
a
wise
man
used
to
say
stay
a
little
that
we
may
make
an
end
the
too
little
attention
however
is
paid
to
this
highly
important
quality
of
accuracy
as
a
man
eminent
in
practical
science
lately
observed
to
us
it
is
astonishing
how
few
people
i
have
met
with
in
the
course
of
my
experience
who
can
a
yet
in
business
affairs
it
is
the
manner
in
which
even
small
matters
are
transacted
that
often
decides
men
for
or
against
you
with
virtue
capacity
and
good
conduct
in
other
respects
the
person
who
is
habitually
inaccurate
can
not
be
trusted
his
work
has
to
be
gone
over
again
and
he
thus
causes
an
infinity
of
annoyance
vexation
and
trouble
it
was
one
of
the
characteristic
qualities
of
charles
james
fox
that
he
was
thoroughly
in
all
that
he
did
when
appointed
secretary
of
state
being
piqued
at
some
observation
as
to
his
bad
writing
he
actually
took
a
and
wrote
copies
like
a
schoolboy
until
he
had
sufficiently
improved
himself
though
a
corpulent
man
he
was
wonderfully
active
at
picking
up
cut
tennis
balls
and
when
asked
how
he
contrived
to
do
so
he
playfully
replied
because
i
am
a
very
the
same
accuracy
in
trifling
matters
was
displayed
by
him
in
things
of
greater
importance
and
he
acquired
his
reputation
like
the
painter
by
neglecting

essential
and
enables
a
larger
amount
of
work
to
be
got

method
said
the
reverend
richard
cecil
is
like
packing
things
in
a
box
a
good
packer
will
get
in
half
as
much
again
as
a
bad
cecil
s
despatch
of
business
was
extraordinary
his
maxim
being
the
shortest
way
to
do
many
things
is
to
do
only
one
thing
at
once
and
he
never
left
a
thing
undone
with
a
view
of
recurring
to
it
at
a
period
of
more
leisure
when
business
pressed
he
rather
chose
to
encroach
on
his
hours
of
meals
and
rest
than
omit
any
part
of
his
work

maxim
was
like
cecil
s
one
thing
at

if
said
he
i
have
any
necessary
despatches
to
make
i
think
of
nothing
else
till
they
are
finished
if
any
domestic
affairs
require
my
attention
i
give
myself
wholly
up
to
them
till
they
are
set
in
a
french
minister
who
was
alike
remarkable
for
his
despatch
of
business
and
his
constant
attendance
at
places
of
amusement
being
asked
how
he
contrived
to
combine
both
objects
replied
simply
by
never
postponing
till
what
should
be
done
lord
brougham
has
said
that
a
certain
english
statesman
reversed
the
process
and
that
his
maxim
was
never
to
transact
what
could
be
postponed
till
unhappily
such
is
the
practice
of
many
besides
that
minister
already
almost
forgotten
the
practice
is
that
of
the
indolent
and
the
unsuccessful
such
men
too
are
apt
to
rely
upon
agents
who
are
not
always
to
be
relied
upon
important
affairs
must
be
attended
to
in
person
if
you
want
your
business
done
says
the
proverb
go
and
do
it
if
you
don
t
want
it
done
send
some
one
an
indolent
country
gentleman
had
a
freehold
estate
producing
about
five
hundred
becoming
involved
in
debt
he
sold
half
the
estate
and
let
the
remainder
to
an
industrious
farmer
for
twenty
years
about
the
end
of
the
term
the
farmer
called
to
pay
his
rent
and
asked
the
owner
whether
he
would
sell
the
farm
will
buy
it
asked
the
owner
surprised
yes
if
we
can
agree
about
the
that
is
exceedingly
strange
observed
the
gentleman
pray
tell
me
how
it
happens
that
while
i
could
not
live
upon
twice
as
much
land
for
which
i
paid
no
rent
you
are
regularly
paying
me
two
hundred
for
your
farm
and
are
able
in
a
few
years
to
purchase
the
reason
is
plain
was
the
reply
you
sat
still
and
said
i
got
up
and
said
you
laid
in
bed
and
enjoyed
your
estate
i
rose
in
the
morning
and
minded
my
sir
walter
scott
writing
to
a
youth
who
had
obtained
a
situation
and
asked
for
his
advice
gave
him
in
reply
this
sound
counsel
beware
of
stumbling
over
a
propensity
which
easily
besets
you
from
not
having
your
time
fully
mean
what
the
women
call
your
motto
must
be
do
instantly
whatever
is
to
be
done
and
take
the
hours
of
recreation
after
business
never
before
it
when
a
regiment
is
under
march
the
rear
is
often
thrown
into
confusion
because
the
front
do
not
move
steadily
and
without
interruption
it
is
the
same
with
business
if
that
which
is
first
in
hand
is
not
instantly
steadily
and
regularly
despatched
other
things
accumulate
behind
till
affairs
begin
to
press
all
at
once
and
no
human
brain
can
stand
the
promptitude
in
action
may
be
stimulated
by
a
due
consideration
of
the
value
of
time
an
italian
philosopher
was
accustomed
to
call
time
his
estate
an
estate
which
produces
nothing
of
value
without
cultivation
but
duly
improved

one
of
the
minor
uses
of
steady
employment
is
that
it
keeps
one
out
of
mischief
for
truly
an
idle
brain
is
the
devil
s
workshop
and
a
lazy
man
the
devil
s
bolster
to
be
occupied
is
to
be
possessed
as
by
a

whereas
to
be
idle
is
to
be
empty

are

temptation

come

is
observed
at

that

are
never

much
disposed
to
grumble

as

an

men
of

are

that

is
money

it
is
more
the
proper
improvement
of
it

growth

an

wasted
daily
on

in

would
if
devoted
to
make
an

wise
in

everywhere
without

an

use
of

is
the
true
mode
of
securing
leisure
it
enables
us
to
get
through
business
and
carry
it
forward
instead
of
being
driven
by
it
on
the
other
hand
the
miscalculation
of

us
in

nelson
once
said
i
owe
all
my
success
in
life
to
having
been
always
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
my
some
take
no
thought
of
the
value
of
money
until
they
have
come
to
an
end
of
it
and
many
do
the
same
with
their
time
the
hours
are
allowed
to
flow
by
unemployed
and
then
when
life
is
fast
waning
they
bethink
themselves
of
the
duty
of
making
a
wiser
use
of
it
but
the
habit
of
listlessness
and
idleness
may
already
have
become
confirmed
and
they
are
unable
to
break
the
bonds
with
which
they
have
permitted
themselves
to
become
bound
lost
wealth
may
be
replaced
by
industry
lost
knowledge
by
study
lost
health
by
temperance
or
medicine
but
lost
time
is
gone
for
ever
a
proper
consideration
of
the
value
of
time
will
also
inspire
habits
of
punctuality
punctuality
said
louis
is
the
politeness
of
it
is
also
the
duty
of
gentlemen
and
the
necessity
of
men
of
business
nothing
begets
confidence
in
a
man
sooner
than
the
practice
of
this
virtue
and
nothing
shakes
confidence
sooner
than
the
want
of
it
he
who
holds
to
his
appointment
and
does
not
keep
you
waiting
for
him
shows
that
he
has
regard
for
your
time
as
well
as
for
his
own
thus
punctuality
is
one
of
the
modes
by
which
we
testify
our
personal
respect
for
those
whom
we
are
called
upon
to
meet
in
the
business
of
life
it
is
also
conscientiousness
in
a
measure
for
an
appointment
is
a
contract
express
or
implied
and
he
who
does
not
keep
it
breaks
faith
as
well
as
dishonestly
uses
other
people
s
time
and
thus
inevitably
loses
character
we
naturally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
person
who
is
careless
about
time
will
be
careless
about
business
and
that
he
is
not
the
one
to
be
trusted
with
the
transaction
of
matters
of
importance
when
washington
s
secretary
excused
himself
for
the
lateness
of
his
attendance
and
laid
the
blame
upon
his
watch
his
master
quietly
said
then
you
must
get
another
watch
or
i
another
the
person
who
is
negligent
of
time
and
its
employment
is
usually
found
to
be
a
general
disturber
of
others
peace
and
serenity
it
was
wittily
said
by
lord
chesterfield
of
the
old
duke
of
his
grace
loses
an
hour
in
the
morning
and
is
looking
for
it
all
the
rest
of
the
everybody
with
whom
the
unpunctual
man
has
to
do
is
thrown
from
time
to
time
into
a
state
of
fever
he
is
systematically
late
regular
only
in
his
irregularity
he
conducts
his
dawdling
as
if
upon
system
arrives
at
his
appointment
after
time
gets
to
the
railway
station
after
the
train
has
started
posts
his
letter
when
the
box
has
closed
thus
business
is
thrown
into
confusion
and
everybody
concerned
is
put
out
of
temper
it
will
generally
be
found
that
the
men
who
are
thus
habitually
behind
time
are
as
habitually
behind
success
and
the
world
generally
casts
them
aside
to
swell
the
ranks
of
the
grumblers
and
the
railers
against
fortune
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
working
qualities
the
business
man
of
the
highest
class
requires
quick
perception
and
firmness
in
the
execution
of
his
plans
tact
is
also
important
and
though
this
is
partly
the
gift
of
nature
it
is
yet
capable
of
being
cultivated
and
developed
by
observation
and
experience
men
of
this
quality
are
quick
to
see
the
right
mode
of
action
and
if
they
have
decision
of
purpose
are
prompt
to
carry
out
their
undertakings
to
a
successful
issue
these
qualities
are
especially
valuable
and
indeed
indispensable
in
those
who
direct
the
action
of
other
men
on
a
large
scale
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
commander
of
an
army
in
the
field
it
is
not
merely
necessary
that
the
general
should
be
great
as
a
warrior
but
also
as
a
man
of
business
he
must
possess
great
tact
much
knowledge
of
character
and
ability
to
organize
the
movements
of
a
large
mass
of
men
whom
he
has
to
feed
clothe
and
furnish
with
whatever
may
be
necessary
in
order
that
they
may
keep
the
field
and
win
battles
in
these
respects
napoleon
and
wellington
were
both
men
of
business
though
napoleon
had
an
immense
love
for
details
he
had
also
a
vivid
power
of
imagination
which
enabled
him
to
look
along
extended
lines
of
action
and
deal
with
those
details
on
a
large
scale
with
judgment
and
rapidity
he
possessed
such
knowledge
of
character
as
enabled
him
to
select
almost
unerringly
the
best
agents
for
the
execution
of
his
designs
but
he
trusted
as
little
as
possible
to
agents
in
matters
of
great
moment
on
which
important
results
depended
this
feature
in
his
character
is
illustrated
in
a
remarkable
degree
by
the
napoleon
correspondence
now
in
course
of
publication
and
particularly
by
the
contents
of
the
volume
which
include
the
letters
orders
and
despatches
written
by
the
emperor
at
finkenstein
a
little
chateau
on
the
frontier
of
poland
in
the
year
shortly
after
the
victory
of
eylau
the
french
army
was
then
lying
encamped
along
the
river
passarge
with
the
russians
before
them
the
austrians
on
their
right
flank
and
the
conquered
prussians
in
their
rear
a
long
line
of
communications
had
to
be
maintained
with
france
through
a
hostile
country
but
so
carefully
and
with
such
foresight
was
this
provided
for
that
it
is
said
napoleon
never
missed
a
post
the
movements
of
armies
the
bringing
up
of
reinforcements
from
remote
points
in
france
spain
italy
and
germany
the
opening
of
canals
and
the
levelling
of
roads
to
enable
the
produce
of
poland
and
prussia
to
be
readily
transported
to
his
encampments
had
his
unceasing
attention
down
to
the
minutest
details
we
find
him
directing
where
horses
were
to
be
obtained
making
arrangements
for
an
adequate
supply
of
saddles
ordering
shoes
for
the
soldiers
and
specifying
the
number
of
rations
of
bread
biscuit
and
spirits
that
were
to
be
brought
to
camp
or
stored
in
magazines
for
the
use
of
the
troops
at
the
same
time
we
find
him
writing
to
paris
giving
directions
for
the
reorganization
of
the
french
college
devising
a
scheme
of
public
education
dictating
bulletins
and
articles
for
the
moniteur
revising
the
details
of
the
budgets
giving
instructions
to
architects
as
to
alterations
to
be
made
at
the
tuileries
and
the
church
of
the
madelaine
throwing
an
occasional
sarcasm
at
madame
de
stael
and
the
parisian
journals
interfering
to
put
down
a
squabble
at
the
grand
opera
carrying
on
a
correspondence
with
the
sultan
of
turkey
and
the
schah
of
persia
so
that
while
his
body
was
at
finkenstein
his
mind
seemed
to
be
working
at
a
hundred
different
places
in
paris
in
europe
and
throughout
the
world
we
find
him
in
one
letter
asking
ney
if
he
has
duly
received
the
muskets
which
have
been
sent
him
in
another
he
gives
directions
to
prince
jerome
as
to
the
shirts
greatcoats
clothes
shoes
shakos
and
arms
to
be
served
out
to
the
wurtemburg
regiments
again
he
presses
cambacérès
to
forward
to
the
army
a
double
stock
of
the
and
the
said
he
are
at
present
out
of
season
and
above
all
it
must
be
done
with
then
he
informs
daru
that
the
army
want
shirts
and
that
they
don
t
come
to
hand
to
massena
he
writes
let
me
know
if
your
biscuit
and
bread
arrangements
are
yet
to
the
grand
due
de
berg
he
gives
directions
as
to
the
accoutrements
of
the
they
complain
that
the
men
want
sabres
send
an
officer
to
obtain
them
at
posen
it
is
also
said
they
want
helmets
order
that
they
be
made
at
ebling
it
is
not
by
sleeping
that
one
can
accomplish
thus
no
point
of
detail
was
neglected
and
the
energies
of
all
were
stimulated
into
action
with
extraordinary
power
though
many
of
the
emperor
s
days
were
occupied
by
inspections
of
his
troops
the
course
of
which
he
sometimes
rode
from
thirty
to
forty
leagues
a
day
by
reviews
receptions
and
affairs
of
state
leaving
but
little
time
for
business
matters
he
neglected
nothing
on
that
account
but
devoted
the
greater
part
of
his
nights
when
necessary
to
examining
budgets
dictating
dispatches
and
attending
to
the
thousand
matters
of
detail
in
the
organization
and
working
of
the
imperial
government
the
machinery
of
which
was
for
the
most
part
concentrated
in
his
own
head
like
napoleon
the
duke
of
wellington
was
a
man
of
business
and
it
is
not
perhaps
saying
too
much
to
aver
that
it
was
in
no
small
degree
because
of
his
possession
of
a
business
faculty
amounting
to
genius
that
the
duke
never
lost
a
battle
while
a
subaltern
he
became
dissatisfied
with
the
slowness
of
his
promotion
and
having
passed
from
the
infantry
to
the
cavalry
twice
and
back
again
without
advancement
he
applied
to
lord
camden
then
viceroy
of
ireland
for
employment
in
the
revenue
or
treasury
board
had
he
succeeded
no
doubt
he
would
have
made
a
head
of
a
department
as
he
would
have
made
a
merchant
or
manufacturer
but
his
application
failed
and
he
remained
with
the
army
to
become
the
greatest
of
british
generals
the
duke
began
his
active
military
career
under
the
duke
of
york
and
general
walmoden
in
flanders
and
holland
where
he
learnt
amidst
misfortunes
and
defeats
how
bad
business
arrangements
and
bad
generalship
serve
to
ruin
the
of
an
army
ten
years
after
entering
the
army
we
find
him
a
colonel
in
india
reported
by
his
superiors
as
an
officer
of
indefatigable
energy
and
application
he
entered
into
the
minutest
details
of
the
service
and
sought
to
raise
the
discipline
of
his
men
to
the
highest
standard
the
regiment
of
colonel
wellesley
wrote
general
harris
in
is
a
model
regiment
on
the
score
of
soldierly
bearing
discipline
instruction
and
orderly
behaviour
it
is
above
all
thus
qualifying
himself
for
posts
of
greater
confidence
he
was
shortly
after
nominated
governor
of
the
capital
of
mysore
in
the
war
with
the
mahrattas
he
was
first
called
upon
to
try
his
hand
at
generalship
and
at
he
won
the
memorable
battle
of
assaye
with
an
army
composed
of
british
and
sepoys
over
mahratta
infantry
and
cavalry
but
so
brilliant
a
victory
did
not
in
the
least
disturb
his
equanimity
or
affect
the
perfect
honesty
of
his
character
shortly
after
this
event
the
opportunity
occurred
for
exhibiting
his
admirable
practical
qualities
as
an
administrator
placed
in
command
of
an
important
district
immediately
after
the
capture
of
seringapatam
his
first
object
was
to
establish
rigid
order
and
discipline
among
his
own
men
flushed
with
victory
the
troops
were
found
riotous
and
disorderly
send
me
the
provost
marshal
said
he
and
put
him
under
my
orders
till
some
of
the
marauders
are
hung
it
is
impossible
to
expect
order
or
this
rigid
severity
of
wellington
in
the
field
though
it
was
the
dread
proved
the
salvation
of
his
troops
in
many
campaigns
his
next
step
was
to
the
markets
and
the
sources
of
supply
general
harris
wrote
to
the
strongly
commending
colonel
wellesley
for
the
perfect
discipline
he
had
established
and
for
his
judicious
and
masterly
arrangements
in
respect
to
supplies
which
opened
an
abundant
free
market
and
inspired
confidence
into
dealers
of
every
the
same
close
attention
to
and
mastery
of
details
characterized
him
throughout
his
indian
career
and
it
is
remarkable
that
one
of
his
ablest
despatches
to
lord
clive
full
of
practical
information
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
campaign
was
written
whilst
the
column
he
commanded
was
crossing
the
toombuddra
in
the
face
of
the
vastly
superior
army
of
dhoondiah
posted
on
the
opposite
bank
and
while
a
thousand
matters
of
the
deepest
interest
were
pressing
upon
the
commander
s
mind
but
it
was
one
of
his
most
remarkable
characteristics
thus
to
be
able
to
withdraw
himself
temporarily
from
the
business
immediately
in
hand
and
to
bend
his
full
powers
upon
the
consideration
of
matters
totally
distinct
even
the
most
difficult
circumstances
on
such
occasions
failing
to
embarrass
or
intimidate
him
returned
to
england
with
a
reputation
for
generalship
sir
arthur
wellesley
met
with
immediate
employment
in
a
corps
of
men
destined
to
liberate
portugal
was
placed
under
his
charge
he
landed
fought
and
won
two
battles
and
signed
the
convention
of
cintra
after
the
death
of
sir
john
moore
he
was
entrusted
with
the
command
of
a
new
expedition
to
portugal
but
wellington
was
fearfully
overmatched
throughout
his
peninsular
campaigns
from
to
he
never
had
more
than
british
troops
under
his
command
at
a
time
when
there
stood
opposed
to
him
in
the
peninsula
some
french
mostly
veterans
led
by
some
of
napoleon
s
ablest
generals
how
was
he
to
contend
against
such
immense
forces
with
any
fair
prospect
of
success
his
clear
discernment
and
strong
common
sense
soon
taught
him
that
he
must
adopt
a
different
policy
from
that
of
the
spanish
generals
who
were
invariably
beaten
and
dispersed
whenever
they
ventured
to
offer
battle
in
the
open
plains
he
perceived
he
had
yet
to
create
the
army
that
was
to
contend
against
the
french
with
any
reasonable
chance
of
success
accordingly
after
the
battle
of
talavera
in
when
he
found
himself
encompassed
on
all
sides
by
superior
forces
of
french
he
retired
into
portugal
there
to
carry
out
the
settled
policy
on
which
he
had
by
this
time
determined
it
was
to
organise
a
portuguese
army
under
british
officers
and
teach
them
to
act
in
combination
with
his
own
troops
in
the
mean
time
avoiding
the
peril
of
a
defeat
by
declining
all
engagements
he
would
thus
he
conceived
destroy
the
of
the
french
who
could
not
exist
without
victories
and
when
his
army
was
ripe
for
action
and
the
enemy
demoralized
he
would
then
fall
upon
them
with
all
his
might
the
extraordinary
qualities
displayed
by
lord
wellington
throughout
these
immortal
campaigns
can
only
be
appreciated
after
a
perusal
of
his
despatches
which
contain
the
unvarnished
tale
of
the
manifold
ways
and
means
by
which
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
success
never
was
man
more
tried
by
difficulty
and
opposition
arising
not
less
from
the
imbecility
falsehoods
and
intrigues
of
the
british
government
of
the
day
than
from
the
selfishness
cowardice
and
vanity
of
the
people
he
went
to
save
it
may
indeed
be
said
of
him
that
he
sustained
the
war
in
spain
by
his
individual
firmness
and
which
never
failed
him
even
in
the
midst
of
his
great
discouragements
he
had
not
only
to
fight
napoleon
s
veterans
but
also
to
hold
in
check
the
spanish
juntas
and
the
portuguese
regency
he
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
obtaining
provisions
and
clothing
for
his
troops
and
it
will
scarcely
be
credited
that
while
engaged
with
the
enemy
in
the
battle
of
talavera
the
spaniards
who
ran
away
fell
upon
the
baggage
of
the
british
army
and
the
ruffians
actually
plundered
it
these
and
other
vexations
the
duke
bore
with
a
sublime
patience
and
and
held
on
his
course
in
the
face
of
ingratitude
treachery
and
opposition
with
indomitable
firmness
he
neglected
nothing
and
attended
to
every
important
detail
of
business
himself
when
he
found
that
food
for
his
troops
was
not
to
be
obtained
from
england
and
that
he
must
rely
upon
his
own
resources
for
feeding
them
he
forthwith
commenced
business
as
a
corn
merchant
on
a
large
scale
in
copartnery
with
the
british
minister
at
lisbon
commissariat
bills
were
created
with
which
grain
was
bought
in
the
ports
of
the
mediterranean
and
in
south
america
when
he
had
thus
filled
his
magazines
the
overplus
was
sold
to
the
portuguese
who
were
greatly
in
want
of
provisions
he
left
nothing
whatever
to
chance
but
provided
for
every
contingency
he
gave
his
attention
to
the
minutest
details
of
the
service
and
was
accustomed
to
concentrate
his
whole
energies
from
time
to
time
on
such
apparently
ignominious
matters
as
soldiers
shoes
biscuits
and
horse
fodder
his
magnificent
business
qualities
were
everywhere
felt
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
the
care
with
which
he
provided
for
every
contingency
and
the
personal
attention
which
he
gave
to
every
detail
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
great
success
by
such
means
he
transformed
an
army
of
raw
levies
into
the
best
soldiers
in
europe
with
whom
he
declared
it
to
be
possible
to
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
we
have
already
referred
to
his
remarkable
power
of
abstracting
himself
from
the
work
no
matter
how
engrossing
immediately
in
hand
and
concentrating
his
energies
upon
the
details
of
some
entirely
different
business
thus
napier
relates
that
it
was
while
he
was
preparing
to
fight
the
battle
of
salamanca
that
he
had
to
expose
to
the
ministers
at
home
the
futility
of
relying
upon
a
loan
it
was
on
the
heights
of
san
christoval
on
the
field
of
battle
itself
that
he
demonstrated
the
absurdity
of
attempting
to
establish
a
portuguese
bank
it
was
in
the
trenches
of
burgos
that
he
dissected
funchal
s
scheme
of
finance
and
exposed
the
folly
of
attempting
the
sale
of
church
property
and
on
each
occasion
he
showed
himself
as
well
acquainted
with
these
subjects
as
with
the
minutest
detail
in
the
mechanism
of
armies
another
feature
in
his
character
showing
the
upright
man
of
business
was
his
thorough
honesty
whilst
soult
ransacked
and
carried
away
with
him
from
spain
numerous
pictures
of
great
value
wellington
did
not
appropriate
to
himself
a
single
farthing
s
worth
of
property
everywhere
he
paid
his
way
even
when
in
the
enemy
s
country
when
he
had
crossed
the
french
frontier
followed
by
spaniards
who
sought
to
make
fortunes
by
pillage
and
plunder
he
first
rebuked
their
officers
and
then
finding
his
efforts
to
restrain
them
unavailing
he
sent
them
back
into
their
own
country
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
even
in
france
the
peasantry
fled
from
their
own
countrymen
and
carried
their
valuables
within
the
protection
of
the
british
lines
at
the
very
same
time
wellington
was
writing
home
to
the
british
ministry
we
are
overwhelmed
with
debts
and
i
can
scarcely
stir
out
of
my
house
on
account
of
public
creditors
waiting
to
demand
payment
of
what
is
due
to
jules
maurel
in
his
estimate
of
the
duke
s
character
says
nothing
can
be
grander
or
more
nobly
original
than
this
admission
this
old
soldier
after
thirty
years
service
this
iron
man
and
victorious
general
established
in
an
enemy
s
country
at
the
head
of
an
immense
army
is
afraid
of
his
creditors
this
is
a
kind
of
fear
that
has
seldom
troubled
the
mind
of
conquerors
and
invaders
and
i
doubt
if
the
annals
of
war
could
present
anything
comparable
to
this
sublime
but
the
duke
himself
had
the
matter
been
put
to
him
would
most
probably
have
disclaimed
any
intention
of
acting
even
grandly
or
nobly
in
the
matter
merely
regarding
the
punctual
payment
of
his
debts
as
the
best
and
most
honourable
mode
of
conducting
his
business
the
truth
of
the
good
old
maxim
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
is
upheld
by
the
daily
experience
of
life
uprightness
and
integrity
being
found
as
successful
in
business
as
in
everything
else
as
hugh
miller
s
worthy
uncle
used
to
advise
him
in
all
your
dealings
give
your
neighbour
the
cast
of
the
good
measure
heaped
up
and
running
over
you
will
not
lose
by
it
in
the
a
brewer
of
beer
attributed
his
success
to
the
liberality
with
which
he
used
his
malt
going
up
to
the
vat
and
tasting
it
he
would
say
still
rather
poor
my
lads
give
it
another
cast
of
the
the
brewer
put
his
character
into
his
beer
and
it
proved
generous
accordingly
obtaining
a
reputation
in
england
india
and
the
colonies
which
laid
the
foundation
of
a
large
fortune
integrity
of
word
and
deed
ought
to
be
the
very
cornerstone
of
all
business
transactions
to
the
tradesman
the
merchant
and
manufacturer
it
should
be
what
honour
is
to
the
soldier
and
charity
to
the
christian
in
the
humblest
calling
there
will
always
be
found
scope
for
the
exercise
of
this
uprightness
of
character
hugh
miller
speaks
of
the
mason
with
whom
he
served
his
apprenticeship
as
one
who
his
conscience
into
every
stone
that
he
so
the
true
mechanic
will
pride
himself
upon
the
thoroughness
and
solidity
of
his
work
and
the
contractor
upon
the
honesty
of
performance
of
his
contract
in
every
particular
the
upright
manufacturer
will
find
not
only
honour
and
reputation
but
substantial
success
in
the
genuineness
of
the
article
which
he
produces
and
the
merchant
in
the
honesty
of
what
he
sells
and
that
it
really
is
what
it
seems
to
be
baron
dupin
speaking
of
the
general
probity
of
englishmen
which
he
held
to
be
a
principal
cause
of
their
success
observed
we
may
succeed
for
a
time
by
fraud
by
surprise
by
violence
but
we
can
succeed
permanently
only
by
means
directly
opposite
it
is
not
alone
the
courage
the
intelligence
the
activity
of
the
merchant
and
manufacturer
which
maintain
the
superiority
of
their
productions
and
the
character
of
their
country
it
is
far
more
their
wisdom
their
economy
and
above
all
their
probity
if
ever
in
the
british
islands
the
useful
citizen
should
lose
these
virtues
we
may
be
sure
that
for
england
as
for
every
other
country
the
vessels
of
a
degenerate
commerce
repulsed
from
every
shore
would
speedily
disappear
from
those
seas
whose
surface
they
now
cover
with
the
treasures
of
the
universe
bartered
for
the
treasures
of
the
industry
of
the
three
it
must
be
admitted
that
trade
tries
character
perhaps
more
severely
than
any
other
pursuit
in
life
it
puts
to
the
severest
tests
honesty
justice
and
truthfulness
and
men
of
business
who
pass
through
such
trials
unstained
are
perhaps
worthy
of
as
great
honour
as
soldiers
who
prove
their
courage
amidst
the
fire
and
perils
of
battle
and
to
the
credit
of
the
multitudes
of
men
engaged
in
the
various
departments
of
trade
we
think
it
must
be
admitted
that
on
the
whole
they
pass
through
their
trials
nobly
if
we
reflect
but
for
a
moment
on
the
vast
amount
of
wealth
daily
entrusted
even
to
subordinate
persons
who
themselves
probably
earn
but
a
bare
loose
cash
which
is
constantly
passing
through
the
hands
of
shopmen
agents
brokers
and
clerks
in
banking
houses
note
how
comparatively
few
are
the
breaches
of
trust
which
occur
amidst
all
this
temptation
it
will
probably
be
admitted
that
this
steady
daily
honesty
of
conduct
is
most
honourable
to
human
nature
if
it
do
not
even
tempt
us
to
be
proud
of
it
the
same
trust
and
confidence
reposed
by
men
of
business
in
each
other
as
implied
by
the
system
of
credit
which
is
mainly
based
upon
the
principle
of
honour
would
be
surprising
if
it
were
not
so
much
a
matter
of
ordinary
practice
in
business
transactions
chalmers
has
well
said
that
the
implicit
trust
with
which
merchants
are
accustomed
to
confide
in
distant
agents
separated
from
them
perhaps
by
half
the
consigning
vast
wealth
to
persons
recommended
only
by
their
character
whom
perhaps
they
have
never
probably
the
finest
act
of
homage
which
men
can
render
to
one
another
although
common
honesty
is
still
happily
in
the
ascendant
amongst
common
people
and
the
general
business
community
of
england
is
still
sound
at
heart
putting
their
honest
character
into
their
respective
callings
are
unhappily
as
there
have
been
in
all
times
but
too
many
instances
of
flagrant
dishonesty
and
fraud
exhibited
by
the
unscrupulous
the
and
the
intensely
selfish
in
their
haste
to
be
rich
there
are
tradesmen
who
adulterate
contractors
who
scamp
manufacturers
who
give
us
shoddy
instead
of
wool
dressing
instead
of
cotton
tools
instead
of
steel
needles
without
eyes
razors
made
only
to
sell
and
swindled
fabrics
in
many
shapes
but
these
we
must
hold
to
be
the
exceptional
cases
of
and
grasping
men
who
though
they
may
gain
wealth
which
they
probably
can
not
enjoy
will
never
gain
an
honest
character
nor
secure
that
without
which
wealth
is
heart
at
peace
the
rogue
cozened
not
me
but
his
own
conscience
said
bishop
latimer
of
a
cutler
who
made
him
pay
twopence
for
a
knife
not
worth
a
penny
money
earned
by
screwing
cheating
and
overreaching
may
for
a
time
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
unthinking
but
the
bubbles
blown
by
unscrupulous
rogues
when
usually
glitter
only
to
burst
the
sadleirs
dean
pauls
and
redpaths
for
the
most
part
come
to
a
sad
end
even
in
this
world
and
though
the
successful
swindles
of
others
may
not
be
found
out
and
the
gains
of
their
roguery
may
remain
with
them
it
will
be
as
a
curse
and
not
as
a
blessing
it
is
possible
that
the
scrupulously
honest
man
may
not
grow
rich
so
fast
as
the
unscrupulous
and
dishonest
one
but
the
success
will
be
of
a
truer
kind
earned
without
fraud
or
injustice
and
even
though
a
man
should
for
a
time
be
unsuccessful
still
he
must
be
honest
better
lose
all
and
save
character
for
character
is
itself
a
fortune
and
if
the
man
will
but
hold
on
his
way
courageously
success
will
surely
come
will
the
highest
reward
of
all
be
withheld
from
him
wordsworth
well
describes
the
happy
warrior
as
he
who
comprehends
his
trust
and
to
the
same
keeps
faithful
with
a
singleness
of
aim
and
therefore
does
not
stoop
nor
lie
in
wait
for
wealth
or
honour
or
for
worldly
state
whom
they
must
follow
on
whose
head
must
fall
like
showers
of
manna
if
they
come
at
as
an
example
of
the
mercantile
man
trained
in
upright
habits
of
business
and
distinguished
for
justice
truthfulness
and
honesty
of
dealing
in
all
things
the
career
of
the
david
barclay
grandson
of
robert
barclay
of
ury
the
author
of
the
celebrated
apology
for
the
quakers
may
be
briefly
referred
to
for
many
years
he
was
the
head
of
an
extensive
house
in
cheapside
chiefly
engaged
in
the
american
trade
but
like
granville
sharp
he
entertained
so
strong
an
opinion
against
the
war
with
our
american
colonies
that
he
determined
to
retire
altogether
from
the
trade
whilst
a
merchant
he
was
as
much
distinguished
for
his
talents
knowledge
integrity
and
power
as
he
afterwards
was
for
his
patriotism
and
munificent
philanthropy
he
was
a
mirror
of
truthfulness
and
honesty
and
as
became
the
good
christian
and
true
gentleman
his
word
was
always
held
to
be
as
good
as
his
bond
his
position
and
his
high
character
induced
the
ministers
of
the
day
on
many
occasions
to
seek
his
advice
and
when
examined
before
the
house
of
commons
on
the
subject
of
the
american
dispute
his
views
were
so
clearly
expressed
and
his
advice
was
so
strongly
justified
by
the
reasons
stated
by
him
that
lord
north
publicly
acknowledged
that
he
had
derived
more
information
from
david
barclay
than
from
all
others
east
of
temple
bar
on
retiring
from
business
it
was
not
to
rest
in
luxurious
ease
but
to
enter
upon
new
labours
of
usefulness
for
others
with
ample
means
he
felt
that
he
still
owed
to
society
the
duty
of
a
good
example
he
founded
a
house
of
industry
near
his
residence
at
walthamstow
which
he
supported
at
a
heavy
outlay
for
several
years
until
at
length
he
succeeded
in
rendering
it
a
source
of
comfort
as
well
as
independence
to
the
families
of
the
poor
in
that
neighbourhood
when
an
estate
in
jamaica
fell
to
him
he
determined
though
at
a
cost
of
some
at
once
to
give
liberty
to
the
whole
of
the
slaves
on
the
property
he
sent
out
an
agent
who
hired
a
ship
and
he
had
the
little
slave
community
transported
to
one
of
the
free
american
states
where
they
settled
down
and
prospered
barclay
had
been
assured
that
the
negroes
were
too
ignorant
and
too
barbarous
for
freedom
and
it
was
thus
that
he
determined
practically
to
demonstrate
the
fallacy
of
the
assertion
in
dealing
with
his
accumulated
savings
he
made
himself
the
executor
of
his
own
will
and
instead
of
leaving
a
large
fortune
to
be
divided
among
his
relatives
at
his
death
he
extended
to
them
his
munificent
aid
during
his
life
watched
and
aided
them
in
their
respective
careers
and
thus
not
only
laid
the
foundation
but
lived
to
see
the
maturity
of
some
of
the
largest
and
most
prosperous
business
concerns
in
the
metropolis
we
believe
that
to
this
day
some
of
our
most
eminent
as
the
gurneys
hanburys
and
proud
to
acknowledge
with
gratitude
the
obligations
they
owe
to
david
barclay
for
the
means
of
their
first
introduction
to
life
and
for
the
benefits
of
his
counsel
and
countenance
in
the
early
stages
of
their
career
such
a
man
stands
as
a
mark
of
the
mercantile
honesty
and
integrity
of
his
country
and
is
a
model
and
example
for
men
of
business
in
all
time
to
come
chapter
use
and
abuse
not
for
to
hide
it
in
a
hedge
nor
for
a
train
attendant
but
for
the
glorious
privilege
of
being
neither
a
borrower
nor
a
lender
be
for
loan
oft
loses
both
itself
and
friend
and
borrowing
dulls
the
edge
of
never
treat
money
affairs
with
is
bulwer
how
a
man
uses
it
saves
it
and
spends
perhaps
one
of
the
best
tests
of
practical
wisdom
although
money
ought
by
no
means
to
be
regarded
as
a
chief
end
of
man
s
life
neither
is
it
a
trifling
matter
to
be
held
in
philosophic
contempt
representing
as
it
does
to
so
large
an
extent
the
means
of
physical
comfort
and
social
indeed
some
of
the
finest
qualities
of
human
nature
are
intimately
related
to
the
right
use
of
money
such
as
generosity
honesty
justice
and
as
well
as
the
practical
virtues
of
economy
and
providence
on
the
other
hand
there
are
their
counterparts
of
avarice
fraud
injustice
and
selfishness
as
displayed
by
the
inordinate
lovers
of
gain
and
the
vices
of
thriftlessness
extravagance
and
improvidence
on
the
part
of
those
who
misuse
and
abuse
the
means
entrusted
to
them
so
that
as
is
wisely
observed
by
henry
taylor
in
his
thoughtful
notes
from
life
a
right
measure
and
manner
in
getting
saving
spending
giving
taking
lending
borrowing
and
bequeathing
would

a

in

circumstances
is
a
con
ion
which
every
man
is
justified
in
striving
to
attain
by
all
worthy
means
it
secures
that
physical
satisfaction
which
is
necessary
for
the
culture
of

part
of

says
the

a

that
the

of
itself
an
education

and
disciplining
him
in
the
exercise

such

necessarily
be
a

he
lives
not
merely
for
the

with

john
sterling
says
truly
that
the
worst
education
which
teaches
self
denial
is
better
than
the
best
which
teaches
everything
else
and
not
the
romans
rightly
employed
the
same
word
virtus
to
designate
courage
which
is
in
a
physical
sense
what
the
other
is
in
a
moral
the
highest
virtue
of
all
being
victory
over
ourselves
hence
the
lesson
of
sacrificing
of
a
present
gratification
for
a
future
one
of
the
last
that
is
learnt
those
classes
which
work
the
hardest
might
naturally
be
expected
to
value
the
most
the
money
which
they
earn
yet
the
readiness
with
which
so
many
are
accustomed
to
eat
up
and
drink
up
their
earnings
as
they
go
renders
them
to
a
great
extent
helpless
and
dependent
upon
the
frugal
there
are
large
numbers
of
persons
among
us
who
though
enjoying
sufficient
means
of
comfort
and
independence
are
often
found
to
be
barely
a
day
s
march
ahead
of
actual
want
when
a
time
of
pressure
occurs
and
hence
a
great
cause
of
social
helplessness
and
suffering
on
one
occasion
a
deputation
waited
on
lord
john
russell
respecting
the
taxation
levied
on
the
working
classes
of
the
country
when
the
noble
lord
took
the
opportunity
of
remarking
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
the
government
of
this
country
durst
not
tax
the
working
classes
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
they
tax
themselves
in
their
expenditure
upon
intoxicating
drinks
alone
of
all
great
public
questions
there
is
perhaps
none
more
important
than
this
great
work
of
reform
calling
more
loudly
for
labourers
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
and
would
make
a
poor
rallying
cry
for
the
hustings
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
patriotism
of
this
day
has
but
little
regard
for
such
common
things
as
individual
economy
and
providence
although
it
is
by
the
practice
of
such
virtues
only
that
the
genuine
independence
of
the
industrial
classes
is
to
be
secured
prudence
frugality
and
good
management
said
samuel
drew
the
philosophical
shoemaker
are
excellent
artists
for
mending
bad
times
they
occupy
but
little
room
in
any
dwelling
but
would
furnish
a
more
effectual
remedy
for
the
evils
of
life
than
any
reform
bill
that
ever
passed
the
houses
of
socrates
said
let
him
that
would
move
the
world
move
first
himself
or
as
the
old
rhyme
if
every
one
would
see
to
his
own
reformation
how
very
easily
you
might
reform
a
it
is
however
generally
felt
to
be
a
far
easier
thing
to
reform
the
church
and
the
state
than
to
reform
the
least
of
our
own
bad
habits
and
in
such
matters
it
is
usually
found
more
agreeable
to
our
tastes
as
it
certainly
is
the
common
practice
to
begin
with
our
neighbours
rather
than
with
ourselves
any
class
of
men
that
lives
from
hand
to
mouth
will
ever
be
an
inferior
class
they
will
necessarily
remain
impotent
and
helpless
hanging
on
to
the
skirts
of
society
the
sport
of
times
and
seasons
having
no
respect
for
themselves
they
will
fail
in
securing
the
respect
of
others
in
commercial
crises
such
men
must
inevitably
go
to
the
wall
wanting
that
husbanded
power
which
a
store
of
savings
no
matter
how
small
invariably
gives
them
they
will
be
at
every
man
s
mercy
and
if
possessed
of
right
feelings
they
can
not
but
regard
with
fear
and
trembling
the
future
possible
fate
of
their
wives
and
children
the
world
once
said
cobden
to
the
working
men
of
huddersfield
has
always
been
divided
into
two
classes
who
have
saved
and
those
who
have
thrifty
and
the
extravagant
the
building
of
all
the
houses
the
mills
the
bridges
and
the
ships
and
the
accomplishment
of
all
other
great
works
which
have
rendered
man
civilized
and
happy
has
been
done
by
the
savers
the
thrifty
and
those
who
have
wasted
their
resources
have
always
been
their
slaves
it
has
been
the
law
of
nature
and
of
providence
that
this
should
be
so
and
i
were
an
impostor
if
i
promised
any
class
that
they
would
advance
themselves
if
they
were
improvident
thoughtless
and
equally
sound
was
the
advice
given
by
mr
bright
to
an
assembly
of
working
men
at
rochdale
in
when
after
expressing
his
belief
that
so
far
as
honesty
was
concerned
it
was
to
be
found
in
pretty
equal
amount
among
all
classes
he
used
the
following
words
there
is
only
one
way
that
is
safe
for
any
man
or
any
number
of
men
by
which
they
can
maintain
their
present
position
if
it
be
a
good
one
or
raise
themselves
above
it
if
it
be
a
bad
one
is
by
the
practice
of
the
virtues
of
industry
frugality
temperance
and
honesty
there
is
no
royal
road
by
which
men
can
raise
themselves
from
a
position
which
they
feel
to
be
uncomfortable
and
unsatisfactory
as
regards
their
mental
or
physical
condition
except
by
the
practice
of
those
virtues
by
which
they
find
numbers
amongst
them
are
continually
advancing
and
bettering
there
is
no
reason
why
the
condition
of
the
average
workman
should
not
be
a
useful
honourable
respectable
and
happy
one
the
whole
body
of
the
working
classes
might
with
few
exceptions
be
as
frugal
virtuous
and
as
many
individuals
of
the
same
class
have
already
made
themselves
what
some
men
are
all
without
difficulty
might
be
employ
the
same
means
and
the
same
results
will
follow
that
there
should
be
a
class
of
men
who
live
by
their
daily
labour
in
every
state
is
the
ordinance
of
god
and
doubtless
is
a
wise
and
righteous
one
but
that
this
class
should
be
otherwise
than
frugal
contented
intelligent
and
happy
is
not
the
design
of
providence
but
springs
solely
from
the
weakness
and
perverseness
of
man
himself
the
healthy
spirit
of
created
amongst
working
people
would
more
than
any
other
measure
serve
to
raise
them
as
a
class
and
this
not
by
pulling
down
others
but
by
levelling
them
up
to
a
higher
and
still
advancing
standard
of
religion
intelligence
and
virtue
all
moral
philosophy
says
montaigne
is
as
applicable
to
a
common
and
private
life
as
to
the
most
splendid
every
man
carries
the
entire
form
of
the
human
condition
within
when
a
man
casts
his
glance
forward
he
will
find
that
the
three
chief
temporal
contingencies
for
which
he
has
to
provide
are
want
of
employment
sickness
and
death
the
two
first
he
may
escape
but
the
last
is
inevitable
it
is
however
the
duty
of
the
prudent
man
so
to
live
and
so
to
arrange
that
the
pressure
of
suffering
in
event
of
either
contingency
occurring
shall
be
mitigated
to
as
great
an
extent
as
possible
not
only
to
himself
but
also
to
those
who
are
dependent
upon
him
for
their
comfort
and
subsistence
viewed
in
this
light
the
honest
earning
and
the
frugal
use
of
money
are
of
the
greatest
importance
rightly
earned
it
is
the
representative
of
patient
industry
and
untiring
effort
of
temptation
resisted
and
hope
rewarded
and
rightly
used
it
affords
indications
of
prudence
forethought
and
true
basis
of
manly
character
though
money
represents
a
crowd
of
objects
without
any
real
worth
or
utility
it
also
represents
many
things
of
great
value
not
only
food
clothing
and
household
satisfaction
but
personal
and
independence
thus
a
store
of
savings
is
to
the
working
man
as
a
barricade
against
want
it
secures
him
a
footing
and
enables
him
to
wait
it
may
be
in
cheerfulness
and
hope
until
better
days
come
round
the
very
endeavour
to
gain
a
firmer
position
in
the
world
has
a
certain
dignity
in
it
and
tends
to
make
a
man
stronger
and
better
at
all
events
it
gives
him
greater
freedom
of
action
and
enables
him
to
husband
his
strength
for
future
effort
but
the
man
who
is
always
hovering
on
the
verge
of
want
is
in
a
state
not
far
removed
from
that
of
slavery
he
is
in
no
sense
his
own
master
but
is
in
constant
peril
of
falling
under
the
bondage
of
others
and
accepting
the
terms
which
they
dictate
to
him
he
can
not
help
being
in
a
measure
servile
for
he
dares
not
look
the
world
boldly
in
the
face
and
in
adverse
times
he
must
look
either
to
alms
or
the
poor
s
rates
if
work
fails
him
altogether
he
has
not
the
means
of
moving
to
another
field
of
employment
he
is
fixed
to
his
parish
like
a
limpet
to
its
rock
and
can
neither
migrate
nor
emigrate
to
secure
independence
the
practice
of
simple
economy
is
all
that
is
necessary
economy
requires
neither
superior
courage
nor
eminent
virtue
it
is
satisfied
with
ordinary
energy
and
the
capacity
of
average
minds
economy
at
bottom
is
but
the
spirit
of
order
applied
in
the
administration
of
domestic
affairs
it
means
management
regularity
prudence
and
the
avoidance
of
waste
the
spirit
of
economy
was
expressed
by
our
divine
master
in
the
words
gather
up
the
fragments
that
remain
so
that
nothing
may
be
his
omnipotence
did
not
disdain
the
small
things
of
life
and
even
while
revealing
his
infinite
power
to
the
multitude
he
taught
the
pregnant
lesson
of
carefulness
of
which
all
stand
so
much
in
need
economy
also
means
the
power
of
resisting
present
gratification
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
future
good
and
in
this
light
it
represents
the
ascendancy
of
reason
over
the
animal
instincts
it
is
altogether
different
from
penuriousness
for
it
is
economy
that
can
always
best
afford
to
be
generous
it
does
not
make
money
an
idol
but
regards
it
as
a
useful
agent
as
dean
swift
observes
we
must
carry
money
in
the
head
not
in
the
economy
may
be
styled
the
daughter
of
prudence
the
sister
of
temperance
and
the
mother
of
liberty
it
is
evidently
of
character
of
domestic
happiness
and
social
it
is
in
short
the
exhibition
of
in
one
of
its
best
forms
francis
horner
s
father
gave
him
this
advice
on
entering
life
whilst
i
wish
you
to
be
comfortable
in
every
respect
i
can
not
too
strongly
inculcate
economy
it
is
a
necessary
virtue
to
all
and
however
the
shallow
part
of
mankind
may
despise
it
it
certainly
leads
to
independence
which
is
a
grand
object
to
every
man
of
a
high
burns
lines
quoted
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
contain
the
right
idea
but
unhappily
his
strain
of
song
was
higher
than
his
practice
his
ideal
better
than
his
habit
when
laid
on
his
he
wrote
to
a
friend
alas

tear
enough
of
this
tis
half
my
every
man
ought
so
to
contrive
as
to
live
within
his
means
this
practice
is
of
the
very
essence
of
honesty
for
if
a
man
do
not
manage
honestly
to
live
within
his
own
means
he
must
necessarily
be
living
dishonestly
upon
the
means
of
somebody
else
those
who
are
careless
about
personal
expenditure
and
consider
merely
their
own
gratification
without
regard
for
the
comfort
of
others
generally
find
out
the
real
uses
of
money
when
it
is
too
late
though
by
nature
generous
these
thriftless
persons
are
often
driven
in
the
end
to
do
very
shabby
things
they
waste
their
money
as
they
do
their
time
draw
bills
upon
the
future
anticipate
their
earnings
and
are
thus
under
the
necessity
of
dragging
after
them
a
load
of
debts
and
obligations
which
seriously
affect
their
action
as
free
and
independent
men
it
was
a
maxim
of
lord
bacon
that
when
it
was
necessary
to
economize
it
was
better
to
look
after
petty
savings
than
to
descend
to
petty
gettings
the
loose
cash
which
many
persons
throw
away
uselessly
and
worse
would
often
form
a
basis
of
fortune
and
independence
for
life
these
wasters
are
their
own
worst
enemies
though
generally
found
amongst
the
ranks
of
those
who
rail
at
the
injustice
of
the
but
if
a
man
will
not
be
his
own
friend
how
can
he
expect
that
others
will
orderly
men
of
moderate
means
have
always
something
left
in
their
pockets
to
help
others
whereas
your
prodigal
and
careless
fellows
who
spend
all
never
find
an
opportunity
for
helping
anybody
it
is
poor
economy
however
to
be
a
scrub
narrowmindedness
in
living
and
in
dealing
is
generally
and
leads
to
failure

way

another

flamborough
said
he

regularly

in

while
i
have
come
to
poverty
and
a
and

in
cases
of
brilliant

from
a
course

and
honest
policy
the
proverb
says
that
an
empty
bag
can
not
stand
upright
neither
can
a
man
who
is
in
debt
it
is
also
difficult
for
a
man
who
is
in
debt
to
be
truthful
hence
it
is
said
that
lying
rides
on
debt
s
back
the
debtor
has
to
frame
excuses
to
his
creditor
for
postponing
payment
of
the
money
he
owes
him
and
probably
also
to
contrive
falsehoods
it
is
easy
enough
for
a
man
who
will
exercise
a
healthy
resolution
to
avoid
incurring
the
first
obligation
but
the
facility
with
which
that
has
been
incurred
often
becomes
a
temptation
to
a
second
and
very
soon
the
unfortunate
borrower
becomes
so
entangled
that
no
late
exertion
of
industry
can
set
him
free
the
first
step
in
debt
is
like
the
first
step
in
falsehood
almost
involving
the
necessity
of
proceeding
in
the
same
course

it

by

it

not

not

whatever
you

poverty
is
a
great
enemy
to

it
certainly
destroys

it
makes
some
virtues
impracticable
and
others
extremely
difficult
frugality

not

of
beneficence
no

that

we
must
have

before

to
it
is
the
bounden
duty
of
every
man
to
look
his
affairs
in
the
face
and
to
keep
an
account
of
his
incomings
and
outgoings
in
money
matters
the
exercise
of
a
little
simple
arithmetic
in
this
way
will
be
found
of
great
value
prudence
requires
that
we
shall
pitch
our
scale
of
living
a
degree
below
our
means
rather
than
up
to
them
but
this
can
only
be
done
by
carrying
out
faithfully
a
plan
of
living
by
which
both
ends
may

made
to

john
locke
strongly
advised
this
course
nothing
said
he
is
likelier
to
keep
a
man
within
compass
than
having
constantly
before
his
eyes
the
state
of
his
affairs
in
a
regular
course
of
the
duke
of
wellington
kept
an
accurate
detailed
account
of
all
the
moneys
received
and
expended
by
him
i
make
a
point
said
he
to
gleig
of
paying
my
own
bills
and
i
advise
every
one
to
do
the
same
formerly
i
used
to
trust
a
confidential
servant
to
pay
them
but
i
was
cured
of
that
folly
by
receiving
one
morning
to
my
great
surprise
duns
of
a
year
or
two
s
standing
the
fellow
had
speculated
with
my
money
and
left
my
bills
talking
of
debt
his
remark
was
it
makes
a
slave
of
a
man
i
have
often
known
what
it
was
to
be
in
want
of
money
but
i
never
got
into
washington
was
as
particular
as
wellington
was
in
matters
of
business
detail
and
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
he
did
not
disdain
to
scrutinize
the
smallest
outgoings
of
his
as
he
was
to
live
honestly
within
his
while
holding
the
high
office
of
president
of
the
american
union
admiral
jervis
earl
vincent
has
told
the
story
of
his
early
struggles
and
amongst
other
things
of
his
determination
to
keep
out
of
debt
my
father
had
a
very
large
family
said
he
with
limited
means
he
gave
me
twenty
pounds
at
starting
and
that
was
all
he
ever
gave
me
after
i
had
been
a
considerable
time
at
the
station
at
sea
i
drew
for
twenty
more
but
the
bill
came
back
protested
i
was
mortified
at
this
rebuke
and
made
a
promise
which
i
have
ever
kept
that
i
would
never
draw
another
bill
without
a
certainty
of
its
being
paid
i
immediately
changed
my
mode
of
living
quitted
my
mess
lived
alone
and
took
up
the
ship
s
allowance
which
i
found
quite
sufficient
washed
and
mended
my
own
clothes
made
a
pair
of
trousers
out
of
the
ticking
of
my
bed
and
having
by
these
means
saved
as
much
money
as
would
redeem
my
honour
i
took
up
my
bill
and
from
that
time
to
this
i
have
taken
care
to
keep
within
my
jervis
for
six
years
endured
pinching
privation
but
preserved
his
integrity
studied
his
profession
with
success
and
gradually
and
steadily
rose
by
merit
and
bravery
to
the
highest
rank
hume
hit
the
mark
when
he
once
stated
in
the
house
of
his
words
were
followed
by
laughter
the
tone
of
living
in
england
is
altogether
too
high
people
are
too
apt
to
live
up
to
their
incomes
if
not
beyond
them
affecting
a
degree
of
style
which
is
most
unhealthy
in
its
effects
upon
society
at
large
there
is
an
ambition
to
bring
up
boys
as
gentlemen
or
rather
genteel
men
though
the
result
frequently
is
only
to
make
them
gents
they
acquire
a
taste
for
dress
style
luxuries
and
amusements
which
can
never
form
any
solid
foundation
for
manly
or
gentlemanly
character
and
the
result
is
that
we
have
a
vast
number
of
gingerbread
young
gentry
thrown
upon
the
world
who
remind
one
of
the
abandoned
hulls
sometimes
picked
up
at
sea
with
only
a
monkey
on
board
there
is
a
dreadful
ambition
abroad
for
being
we
keep
up
appearances
too
often
at
the
expense
of
honesty
and
though
we
may
not
be
rich
yet
we
must
seem
to
be
so
we
must
be
respectable
though
only
in
the
meanest
mere
vulgar
outward
show
we
have
not
the
courage
to
go
patiently
onward
in
the
condition
of
life
in
which
it
has
pleased
god
to
call
us
but
must
needs
live
in
some
fashionable
state
to
which
we
ridiculously
please
to
call
ourselves
and
all
to
gratify
the
vanity
of
that
unsubstantial
genteel
world
of
which
we
form
a
part
there
is
a
constant
struggle
and
pressure
for
front
seats
in
the
social
amphitheatre
in
the
midst
of
which
all
noble
resolve
is
trodden
down
and
many
fine
natures
are
inevitably
crushed
to
death
what
waste
what
misery
what
bankruptcy
come
from
all
this
ambition
to
dazzle
others
with
the
glare
of
apparent
worldly
success
we
need
not
describe
the
mischievous
results
show
themselves
in
a
thousand
the
rank
frauds
committed
by
men
who
dare
to
be
dishonest
but
do
not
dare
to
seem
poor
and
in
the
desperate
dashes
at
fortune
in
which
the
pity
is
not
so
much
for
those
who
fail
as
for
the
hundreds
of
innocent
families
who
are
so
often
involved
in
their
ruin
the
late
sir
charles
napier
in
taking
leave
of
his
command
in
india
did
a
bold
and
honest
thing
in
publishing
his
strong
protest
embodied
in
his
last
general
order
to
the
officers
of
the
indian
army
against
the
fast
life
led
by
so
many
young
officers
in
that
service
involving
them
in
ignominious
obligations
sir
charles
strongly
urged
in
that
famous
had
almost
been
lost
sight
of
that
honesty
is
inseparable
from
the
character
of
a
gentleman
and
that
to
drink
champagne
and
beer
and
to
ride
horses
is
to
be
a
cheat
and
not
a
men
who
lived
beyond
their
means
and
were
summoned
often
by
their
own
servants
before
courts
of
requests
for
debts
contracted
in
extravagant
living
might
be
officers
by
virtue
of
their
commissions
but
they
were
not
gentlemen
the
habit
of
being
constantly
in
debt
the
held
made
men
grow
callous
to
the
proper
feelings
of
a
gentleman
it
was
not
enough
that
an
officer
should
be
able
to
fight
that
any
could
do
but
did
he
hold
his
word
inviolate
he
pay
his
debts
these
were
among
the
points
of
honour
which
he
insisted
illuminated
the
true
gentleman
s
and
soldier
s
career
as
bayard
was
of
old
so
would
sir
charles
napier
have
all
british
officers
to
be
he
knew
them
to
be
without
fear
but
he
would
also
have
them
without
there
are
however
many
gallant
young
fellows
both
in
india
and
at
home
capable
of
mounting
a
breach
on
an
emergency
amidst
belching
fire
and
of
performing
the
most
desperate
deeds
of
valour
who
nevertheless
can
not
or
will
not
exercise
the
moral
courage
necessary
to
enable
them
to
resist
a
petty
temptation
presented
to
their
senses
they
can
not
utter
their
valiant
no
or
i
can
t
afford
it
to
the
invitations
of
pleasure
and
and
they
are
found
ready
to
brave
death
rather
than
the
ridicule
of
their
companions
the
young
man
as
he
passes
through
life
advances
through
a
long
line
of
tempters
ranged
on
either
side
of
him
and
the
inevitable
effect
of
yielding
is
degradation
in
a
greater
or
a
less
degree
contact
with
them
tends
insensibly
to
draw
away
from
him
some
portion
of
the
divine
electric
element
with
which
his
nature
is
charged
and
his
only
mode
of
resisting
them
is
to
utter
and
to
act
out
his
no
manfully
and
resolutely
he
must
decide
at
once
not
waiting
to
deliberate
and
balance
reasons
for
the
youth
like
the
woman
who
deliberates
is
many
deliberate
without
deciding
but
not
to
resolve
to
a
perfect
knowledge
of
man
is
in
the
prayer
lead
us
not
into
but
temptation
will
come
to
try
the
young
man
s
strength
and
once
yielded
to
the
power
to
resist
grows
weaker
and
weaker
yield
once
and
a
portion
of
virtue
has
gone
resist
manfully
and
the
first
decision
will
give
strength
for
life
repeated
it
will
become
a
habit
it
is
in
the
outworks
of
the
habits
formed
in
early
life
that
the
real
strength
of
the
defence
must
lie
for
it
has
been
wisely
ordained
that
the
machinery
of
moral
existence
should
be
carried
on
principally
through
the
medium
of
the
habits
so
as
to
save
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
great
principles
within
it
is
good
habits
which
insinuate
themselves
into
the
thousand
inconsiderable
acts
of
life
that
really
constitute
by
far
the
greater
part
of
man
s
moral
conduct
hugh
miller
has
told
how
by
an
act
of
youthful
decision
he
saved
himself
from
one
of
the
strong
temptations
so
peculiar
to
a
life
of
toil
when
employed
as
a
mason
it
was
usual
for
his
to
have
an
occasional
treat
of
drink
and
one
day
two
glasses
of
whisky
fell
to
his
share
which
he
swallowed
when
he
reached
home
he
found
on
opening
his
favourite
bacon
s
essays
the
letters
danced
before
his
eyes
and
that
he
could
no
longer
master
the
sense
the
condition
he
says
into
which
i
had
brought
myself
was
i
felt
one
of
degradation
i
had
sunk
by
my
own
act
for
the
time
to
a
lower
level
of
intelligence
than
that
on
which
it
was
my
privilege
to
be
placed
and
though
the
state
could
have
been
no
very
favourable
one
for
forming
a
resolution
i
in
that
hour
determined
that
i
should
never
again
sacrifice
my
capacity
of
intellectual
enjoyment
to
a
drinking
usage
and
with
god
s
help
i
was
enabled
to
hold
by
the
it
is
such
decisions
as
this
that
often
form
the
in
a
man
s
life
and
furnish
the
foundation
of
his
future
character
and
this
rock
on
which
hugh
miller
might
have
been
wrecked
if
he
had
not
at
the
right
moment
put
forth
his
moral
strength
to
strike
away
from
it
is
one
that
youth
and
manhood
alike
need
to
be
constantly
on
their
guard
against
it
is
about
one
of
the
worst
and
most
deadly
as
well
as
extravagant
temptations
which
lie
in
the
way
of
youth
sir
walter
scott
used
to
say
that
of
all
vices
drinking
is
the
most
incompatible
with
not
only
so
but
it
is
incompatible
with
economy
decency
health
and
honest
living
when
a
youth
can
not
restrain
he
must
abstain
johnson
s
case
is
the
case
of
many
he
said
referring
to
his
own
habits
sir
i
can
abstain
but
i
can
t
be
but
to
wrestle
vigorously
and
successfully
with
any
vicious
habit
we
must
not
merely
be
satisfied
with
contending
on
the
low
ground
of
worldly
prudence
though
that
is
of
use
but
take
stand
upon
a
higher
moral
elevation
mechanical
aids
such
as
pledges
may
be
of
service
to
some
but
the
great
thing
is
to
set
up
a
high
standard
of
thinking
and
acting
and
endeavour
to
strengthen
and
purify
the
principles
as
well
as
to
reform
the
habits
for
this
purpose
a
youth
must
study
himself
watch
his
steps
and
compare
his
thoughts
and
acts
with
his
rule
the
more
knowledge
of
himself
he
gains
the
more
humble
will
he
be
and
perhaps
the
less
confident
in
his
own
strength
but
the
discipline
will
be
always
found
most
valuable
which
is
acquired
by
resisting
small
present
gratifications
to
secure
a
prospective
greater
and
higher
one
it
is
the
noblest
work
in
real
glory
springs
from
the
silent
conquest
of
ourselves
and
without
that
the
conqueror
is
nought
but
the
first
many
popular
books
have
been
written
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
to
the
public
the
grand
secret
of
making
money
but
there
is
no
secret
whatever
about
it
as
the
proverbs
of
every
nation
abundantly
testify
take
care
of
the
pennies
and
the
pounds
will
take
care
of
diligence
is
the
mother
of
good
no
pains
no
no
sweat
no
work
and
thou
shalt
the
world
is
his
who
has
patience
and
better
go
to
bed
supperless
than
rise
in
such
are
specimens
of
the
proverbial
philosophy
embodying
the
hoarded
experience
of
many
generations
as
to
the
best
means
of
thriving
in
the
world
they
were
current
in
people
s
mouths
long
before
books
were
invented
and
like
other
popular
proverbs
they
were
the
first
codes
of
popular
morals
moreover
they
have
stood
the
test
of
time
and
the
experience
of
every
day
still
bears
witness
to
their
accuracy
force
and
soundness
the
proverbs
of
solomon
are
full
of
wisdom
as
to
the
force
of
industry
and
the
use
and
abuse
of
money
he
that
is
slothful
in
work
is
brother
to
him
that
is
a
great
go
to
the
ant
thou
sluggard
consider
her
ways
and
be
poverty
says
the
preacher
shall
come
upon
the
idler
as
one
that
travelleth
and
want
as
an
armed
man
but
of
the
industrious
and
upright
the
hand
of
the
diligent
maketh
the
drunkard
and
the
glutton
shall
come
to
poverty
and
drowsiness
shall
clothe
a
man
with
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
he
shall
stand
before
but
above
all
it
is
better
to
get
wisdom
than
gold
for
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
to
be
compared
to
simple
industry
and
thrift
will
go
far
towards
making
any
person
of
ordinary
working
faculty
comparatively
independent
in
his
means
even
a
working
man
may
be
so
provided
he
will
carefully
husband
his
resources
and
watch
the
little
outlets
of
useless
expenditure
a
penny
is
a
very
small
matter
yet
the
comfort
of
thousands
of
families
depends
upon
the
proper
spending
and
saving
of
pennies
if
a
man
allows
the
little
pennies
the
results
of
his
hard
work
to
slip
out
of
his
to
the
beershop
some
this
way
and
some
will
find
that
his
life
is
little
raised
above
one
of
mere
animal
drudgery
on
the
other
hand
if
he
take
care
of
the
some
weekly
into
a
benefit
society
or
an
insurance
fund
others
into
a
savings
bank
and
confiding
the
rest
to
his
wife
to
be
carefully
laid
out
with
a
view
to
the
comfortable
maintenance
and
education
of
his
will
soon
find
that
this
attention
to
small
matters
will
abundantly
repay
him
in
increasing
means
growing
comfort
at
home
and
a
mind
comparatively
free
from
fears
as
to
the
future
and
if
a
working
man
have
high
ambition
and
possess
richness
in
spirit
kind
of
wealth
which
far
transcends
all
mere
worldly
may
not
only
help
himself
but
be
a
profitable
helper
of
others
in
his
path
through
life
that
this
is
no
impossible
thing
even
for
a
common
labourer
in
a
workshop
may
be
illustrated
by
the
remarkable
career
of
thomas
wright
of
manchester
who
not
only
attempted
but
succeeded
in
the
reclamation
of
many
criminals
while
working
for
weekly
wages
in
a
foundry
accident
first
directed
thomas
wright
s
attention
to
the
difficulty
encountered
by
liberated
convicts
in
returning
to
habits
of
honest
industry
his
mind
was
shortly
possessed
by
the
subject
and
to
remedy
the
evil
became
the
purpose
of
his
life
though
he
worked
from
six
in
the
morning
till
six
at
night
still
there
were
leisure
minutes
that
he
could
call
his
especially
his
these
he
employed
in
the
service
of
convicted
criminals
a
class
then
far
more
neglected
than
they
are
now
but
a
few
minutes
a
day
well
employed
can
effect
a
great
deal
and
it
will
scarcely
be
credited
that
in
ten
years
this
working
man
by
steadfastly
holding
to
his
purpose
succeeded
in
rescuing
not
fewer
than
three
hundred
felons
from
continuance
in
a
life
of
villany

often
succeeded

thus
restored
reformed
to
their
parents
sons
and

otherwise
lost
to
their
homes
and
many
a
returned
convict
did
he
contrive
to
settle
down
to
honest
and
industrious
pursuits
the
task
was
by
no
means
easy
it
required
money
time
energy
prudence
and
above
all
character
and
the
confidence
which
character
invariably
inspires
the
most
remarkable
circumstance
was
that
wright
relieved
many
of
these
poor
outcasts
out
of
the
comparatively
small
wages
earned
by
him
at
foundry
work
he
did
all
this
on
an
income
which
did
not
average
during
his
working
career
per
annum
and
yet
while
he
was
able
to
bestow
substantial
aid
on
criminals
to
whom
he
owed
no
more
than
the
service
of
kindness
which
every
human
being
owes
to
another
he
also
maintained
his
family
in
comfort
and
was
by
frugality
and
carefulness
enabled
to
lay
by
a
store
of
savings
against
his
approaching
old
age
every
week
he
apportioned
his
income
with
deliberate
care
so
much
for
the
indispensable
necessaries
of
food
and
clothing
so
much
for
the
landlord
so
much
for
the
schoolmaster
so
much
for
the
poor
and
needy
and
the
lines
of
distribution
were
resolutely
observed
by
such
means
did
this
humble
workman
pursue
his
great
work
with
the
results
we
have
so
briefly
described
indeed
his
career
affords
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
striking
illustrations
of
the
force
of
purpose
in
a
man
of
the
might
of
small
means
carefully
and
sedulously
applied
and
above
all
of
the
power
which
an
energetic
and
upright
character
invariably
exercises
upon
the
lives
and
conduct
of
others
there
is
no
discredit
but
honour
in
every
right
walk
of
industry
whether
it
be
in
tilling
the
ground
making
tools
weaving
fabrics
or
selling
the
products
behind
a
counter
a
youth
may
handle
a
or
measure
a
piece
of
ribbon
and
there
will
be
no
discredit
in
doing
so
unless
he
allows
his
mind
to
have
no
higher
range
than
the
stick
and
ribbon
to
be
as
short
as
the
one
and
as
narrow
as
the
other
let
not
those
blush
who
said
fuller
but
those
who
a
lawful
and
bishop
hall
said
sweet
is
the
destiny
of
all
trades
whether
of
the
brow
or
of
the
men
who
have
raised
themselves
from
a
humble
calling
need
not
be
ashamed
but
rather
ought
to
be
proud
of
the
difficulties
they
have
surmounted
an
american
president
when
asked
what
was
his
remembering
that
he

the

of
his

which
flechier
replied
if
you
had
been
born
in
the
same
condition
that
i
was
you
would
still
have
been
but
a
maker
of
nothing
is
more
common
than
energy
in
quite
independent
of
any
higher
object
than
its
accumulation
a
man
who
devotes
himself
to
this
pursuit

and

osterwald
the
parisian
banker
began
life
a
poor
man
he
was
accustomed
every
evening
to
drink
a
pint
of
beer
for
supper
at
a
tavern
which
he
visited
during
which
he
collected
and
pocketed
all
the
corks
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
in
eight
years
he
had
collected
as
many
corks
as
sold
for
eight
louis
d
ors
with
that
sum
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
mostly
by
leaving
at
his
death
some
three
millions
of
francs
john
foster
has
cited
a
striking
illustration
of
what
this
kind
of
determination
will
do
in
a
young
man
who
ran
through
his
patrimony
spending
it
in
profligacy
was
at
length
reduced
to
utter
want
and
despair
he
rushed
out
of
his
house
intending
to
put
an
end
to
his
life
and
stopped
on
arriving
at
an
eminence
overlooking
what
were
once
his
estates
he
sat
down
ruminated
for
a
time
and
rose
with
the
determination
that
he
would
recover
them
he
returned
to
the
streets
saw
a
load
of
coals
which
had
been
shot
out
of
a
cart
on
to
the
pavement
before
a
house
offered
to
carry
them
in
and
was
employed
he
thus
earned
a
few
pence
requested
some
meat
and
drink
as
a
gratuity
which
was
given
him
and
the
pennies
were
laid
by
pursuing
this
menial
labour
he
earned
and
saved
more
pennies
accumulated
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
purchase
some
cattle
the
value
of
which
he
understood
and
these
he
sold
to
advantage
he
proceeded
by
degrees
to
undertake
larger
transactions
until
at
length
he
became
rich
the
result
was
that
he
more
than
recovered
his
possessions
and
died
an
inveterate
miser
when
he
was
buried
mere
earth
went
to
earth
with
a
nobler
spirit
the
same
determination
might
have
enabled
such
a
man
to
be
a
benefactor
to
others
as
well
as
to
himself
but
the
life
and
its
end
in
this
case
were
alike
sordid
to
provide
for
others
and
for
our
own
comfort
and
independence
in
old
age
is
honourable
and
greatly
to
be
commended
but
to
hoard
for
mere
wealth
s
sake
is
the
characteristic
of
the
and
the
miserly
it
is
against
the
growth
of
this
habit
of
inordinate
saving
that
the
wise
man
needs
most
carefully
to
guard
himself
else
what
in
youth
was
simple
economy
may
in
old
age
grow
into
avarice
and
what
was
a
duty
in
the
one
case
may
become
a
vice
in
the
other
it
is
the
of
money
is
the
root
of
evil
love
which
narrows
and
contracts
the
soul
and
closes
it
against
generous
life
and
action
hence
sir
walter
scott
makes
one
of
his
characters
declare
that
the
penny
siller
slew
more
souls
than
the
naked
sword
slew
it
is
one
of
the
defects
of
business
too
exclusively
followed
that
it
insensibly
tends
to
a
mechanism
of
character
the
business
man
gets
into
a
rut
and
often
does
not
look
beyond
it
if
he
lives
for
himself
only
he
becomes
apt
to
regard
other
human
beings
only
in
so
far
as
they
minister
to
his
ends
take
a
leaf
from
such
men
s
ledger
and
you
have
their
life
worldly
success
measured
by
the
accumulation
of
money
is
no
doubt
a
very
dazzling
thing
and
all
men
are
naturally
more
or
less
the
admirers
of
worldly
success
but
though
men
of
persevering
sharp
dexterous
and
unscrupulous
habits
ever
on
the
watch
to
push
opportunities
may
and
do
get
on
in
the
world
yet
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
may
not
possess
the
slightest
elevation
of
character
nor
a
particle
of
real
goodness
he
who
recognizes
no
higher
logic
than
that
of
the
shilling
may
become
a
very
rich
man
and
yet
remain
all
the
while
an
exceedingly
poor
creature
for
riches
are
no
proof
whatever
of
moral
worth
and
their
glitter
often
serves
only
to
draw
attention
to
the
worthlessness
of
their
possessor
as
the
light
of
the
glowworm
reveals
the
grub
the
manner
in
which
many
allow
themselves
to
be
sacrificed
to
their
love
of
wealth
reminds
one
of
the
cupidity
of
the
caricature
of
our
species
in
algiers
the
kabyle
peasant
attaches
a
gourd
well
fixed
to
a
tree
and
places
within
it
some
rice
the
gourd
has
an
opening
merely
sufficient
to
admit
the
monkey
s
paw
the
creature
comes
to
the
tree
by
night
inserts
his
paw
and
grasps
his
booty
he
tries
to
draw
it
back
but
it
is
clenched
and
he
has
not
the
wisdom
to
unclench
it
so
there
he
stands
till
morning
when
he
is
caught
looking
as
foolish
as
may
be
though
with
the
prize
in
his
grasp
the
moral
of
this
little
story
is
capable
of
a
very
extensive
application
in
life
the
power
of
money
is
on
the
whole
the
greatest
things
which
have
been
done
for
the
world
have
not
been
accomplished
by
rich
men
nor
by
subscription
lists
but
by
men
generally
of
small
pecuniary
means
christianity
was
propagated
over
half
the
world
by
men
of
the
poorest
class
and
the
greatest
thinkers
discoverers
inventors
and
artists
have
been
men
of
moderate
wealth
many
of
them
little
raised
above
the
condition
of
manual
labourers
in
point
of
worldly
circumstances
and
it
will
always
be
so
riches
are
oftener
an
impediment
than
a
stimulus
to
action
and
in
many
cases
they
are
quite
as
much
a
misfortune
as
a
blessing
the
youth
who
inherits
wealth
is
apt
to
have
life
made
too
easy
for
him
and
he
soon
grows
sated
with
it
because
he
has
nothing
left
to
desire
having
no
special
object
to
struggle
for
he
finds
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
he
remains
morally
and
spiritually
asleep
and
his
position
in
society
is
often
no
higher
than
that
of
a
polypus
over
which
the
tide
floats
his
only
labour
is
to
kill
the
time
and
labour
dire
it
is
and
weary
yet
the
rich
man
inspired
by
a
right
spirit
will
spurn
idleness
as
unmanly
and
if
he
bethink
himself
of
the
responsibilities
which
attach
to
the
possession
of
wealth
and
property
he
will
feel
even
a
higher
call
to
work
than
men
of
humbler
lot
this
however
must
be
admitted
to
be
by
no
means
the

the

that
of

to
an

the
simple
exercise
of
homely

punctuality

down

the
close
of

life
when
not

he
did

as

in

to

he
was

in
all
things
he
made
it
appear
to
those
who
knew
him
in

life
that
the
glory
he
sought
was
to
be

worth

the
respectability
that

the

to
remember
this

and
he
used
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
fact
that
professionally
he
was

this
is
necessarily
the
case
with
all
men
who
have
acquired
distinction
in
letters
science
or
art
the
education
received
at
school
or
college
is
but
a
beginning
and
is
valuable
mainly
inasmuch
as
it
trains
the
mind
and
habituates
it
to
continuous
application
and
study
that
which
is
put
into
us
by
others
is
always
far
less
ours
than
that
which
we
acquire
by
our
own
diligent
and
persevering
effort
knowledge
conquered
by
labour
becomes
a
property
entirely
our
own
a
greater
vividness
and
permanency
of
impression
is
secured

active

the
essential
thing

no

no
books
no
teachers
no

of
lessons
learnt
by

will
enable
us
to
dispense
with
it
the
best
teachers
have
been
the
readiest
to
recognize
the
importance
of
and
of
stimulating
the
student
to
acquire
knowledge
by
the
active
exercise
of
his
own
faculties
they
have
relied
more
upon
than
upon
telling
and
sought
to
make
their
pupils
themselves
active
parties
to
the
work
in
which
they
were
engaged
thus
making
teaching
something
far
higher
than
the
mere
passive
reception
of
the
scraps
and
details
of
knowledge
this
was
the
spirit
in
which
the
great

truly
and
zealously
speaking
of
a
pupil
of
this
character
he
said
i
would
stand
to
that
man
hat
in
once
at
laleham
when
teaching
a
rather
dull
boy
arnold
spoke
somewhat
sharply
to
him
on
which
the
pupil
looked
up
in
his
face
and
said
why
do
you
speak
angrily
sir
i
am
doing
the
best
i
years
afterwards
arnold
used
to
tell
the
story
to
his
children
and
added
i
never
felt
so
much
in
my
look
and
that
speech
i
have
never
from
the
numerous
instances
already
cited
of
men
of
humble
station
who
have
risen
to
distinction
in
science
and
literature
it
will
be
obvious
that
labour
is
by
no
means
incompatible
with
the
highest
intellectual
culture
work
in
moderation
is
healthy
as
well
as
agreeable
to
the
human
constitution
work
educates
the
body
as
study
educates
the
mind
and
that
is
the
best
state
of
society
in
which
there
is
some
work
for
every
man
s
leisure
and
some
leisure
for
every
man
s
work
even
the
leisure
classes
are
in
a
measure
compelled
to
work
sometimes
as
a
relief
from
but
in
most
cases
to
gratify
an
instinct
which
they
can
not
resist
some
go
foxhunting
in
the
english
counties
others
on
the
scotch
hills
while
many
wander
away
every
summer
to
climb
mountains
in
switzerland
hence
the
boating
running
cricketing
and
athletic
sports
of
the
public
schools
in
which
our
young
men
at
the
same
time
so
healthfully
cultivate
their
strength
both
of
mind
and
body
it
is
said
that
the
duke
of
wellington
when
once
looking
on
at
the
boys
engaged
in
their
sports
in
the
at
eton
where
he
had
spent
many
of
his
own
younger
days
made
the
remark
it
was
there
that
the
battle
of
waterloo
was
won
daniel
malthus
urged
his
son
when
at
college
to
be
most
diligent
in
the
cultivation
of
knowledge
but
he
also
enjoined
him
to
pursue
manly
sports
as
the
best
means
of
keeping
up
the
full
working
power
of
his
mind
as
well
as
of
enjoying
the
pleasures
of
intellect
every
kind
of
knowledge
said
he
every
acquaintance
with
nature
and
art
will
amuse
and
strengthen
your
mind
and
i
am
perfectly
pleased
that
cricket
should
do
the
same
by
your
arms
and
legs
i
love
to
see
you
excel
in
exercises
of
the
body
and
i
think
myself
that
the
better
half
and
much
the
most
agreeable
part
of
the
pleasures
of
the
mind
is
best
enjoyed
while
one
is
upon
one
s
but
a
still
more
important
use
of
active
employment
is
that
referred
to
by
the
great
divine
jeremy
taylor
avoid
idleness
he
says
and
fill
up
all
the
spaces
of
thy
time
with
severe
and
useful
employment
for
lust
easily
creeps
in
at
those
emptinesses
where
the
soul
is
unemployed
and
the
body
is
at
ease
for
no
easy
healthful
idle
person
was
ever
chaste
if
he
could
be
tempted
but
of
all
employments
bodily
labour
is
the
most
useful
and
of
the
greatest
benefit
for
driving
away
the
practical
success
in
life
depends
more
upon
physical
health
than
is
generally
imagined
hodson
of
hodson
s
horse
writing
home
to
a
friend
in
england
said
i
believe
if
i
get
on
well
in
india
it
will
be
owing
physically
speaking
to
a
sound
the
capacity
for
continuous
working
in
any
calling
must
necessarily
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
this
and
hence
the
necessity
for
attending
to
health
even
as
a
means
of
intellectual
labour
it
is
perhaps
to
the
neglect
of
physical
exercise
that
we
find
amongst
students
so
frequent
a
tendency
towards
discontent
unhappiness
inaction
and
reverie
itself
in
contempt
for
real
life
and
disgust
at
the
beaten
tracks
of
men
tendency
which
in
england
has
been
called
byronism
and
in
germany
wertherism
channing
noted
the
same
growth
in
america
which
led
him
to
make
the
remark
that
too
many
of
our
young
men
grow
up
in
a
school
of
the
only
remedy
for
this
in
youth
is
physical
work
and
bodily
occupation
the
use
of
early
labour
in
mechanical
employments
may
be
illustrated
by
the
boyhood
of
sir
isaac
newton
though
a
comparatively
dull
scholar
he
was
very
assiduous
in
the
use
of
his
saw
hammer
and
knocking
and
hammering
in
his
lodging
room
models
of
windmills
carriages
and
machines
of
all
sorts
and
as
he
grew
older
he
took
delight
in
making
little
tables
and
cupboards
for
his
friends
smeaton
watt
and
stephenson
were
equally
handy
with
tools
when
mere
boys
and
but
for
such
kind
of
in
their
youth
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
would
have
accomplished
so
much
in
their
manhood
such
was
also
the
early
training
of
the
great
inventors
and
mechanics
described
in
the
preceding
pages
whose
contrivance
and
intelligence
were
practically
trained
by
the
constant
use
of
their
hands
in
early
life
even
where
men
belonging
to
the
manual
labour
class
have
risen
above
it
and
become
more
purely
intellectual
labourers
they
have
found
the
advantages
of
their
early
training
in
their
later
pursuits
elihu
burritt
says
he
found
hard
labour
to
enable
him
to
study
with
effect
and
more
than
once
he
gave
up
and
study
and
taking
to
his
again
went
back
to
his
blacksmith
s
forge
and
anvil
for
his
health
of
body
and
mind
s
sake
the
training
of
young
men
in
the
use
of
tools
would
at
the
same
time
that
it
educated
them
in
common
things
teach
them
the
use
of
their
hands
and
arms
familiarize
them
with
healthy
work
exercise
their
faculties
upon
things
tangible
and
actual
give
them
some
practical
acquaintance
with
mechanics
impart
to
them
the
ability
of
being
useful
and
implant
in
them
the
habit
of
persevering
physical
effort
this
is
an
advantage
which
the
working
classes
strictly
so
called
certainly
possess
over
the
leisure
classes
they
are
in
early
life
under
the
necessity
of
applying
themselves
laboriously
to
some
mechanical
pursuit
or
other
acquiring
manual
dexterity
and
the
use
of
their
physical
powers
the
chief
disadvantage
attached
to
the
calling
of
the
laborious
classes
is
not
that
they
are
employed
in
physical
work
but
that
they
are
too
exclusively
so
employed
often
to
the
neglect
of
their
moral
and
intellectual
faculties
while
the
youths
of
the
leisure
classes
having
been
taught
to
associate
labour
with
servility
have
shunned
it
and
been
allowed
to
grow
up
practically
ignorant
the
poorer
classes
confining
themselves
within
the
circle
of
their
laborious
callings
have
been
allowed
to
grow
up
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
absolutely
illiterate
it
seems
possible
however
to
avoid
both
these
evils
by
combining
physical
training
or
physical
work
with
intellectual
culture
and
there
are
various
signs
abroad
which
seem
to
mark
the
gradual
adoption
of
this
healthier
system
of
education
the
success
of
even
professional
men
depends
in
no
slight
degree
on
their
physical
health
and
a
public
writer
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
greatness
of
our
great
men
is
quite
as
much
a
bodily
affair
as
a
mental
a
healthy
breathing
apparatus
is
as
indispensable
to
the
successful
lawyer
or
politician
as
a
intellect
the
thorough
aëration
of
the
blood
by
free
exposure
to
a
large
breathing
surface
in
the
lungs
is
necessary
to
maintain
that
full
vital
power
on
which
the
vigorous
working
of
the
brain
in
so
large
a
measure
depends
the
lawyer
has
to
climb
the
heights
of
his
profession
through
close
and
heated
courts
and
the
political
leader
has
to
bear
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
long
and
anxious
debates
in
a
crowded
house
hence
the
lawyer
in
full
practice
and
the
parliamentary
leader
in
full
work
are
called
upon
to
display
powers
of
physical
endurance
and
activity
even
more
extraordinary
than
those
of
the
intellect
powers
as
have
been
exhibited
in
so
remarkable
a
degree
by
brougham
lyndhurst
and
campbell
by
peel
graham
and
men
though
sir
walter
scott
when
at
edinburgh
college
went
by
the
name
of
the
greek
blockhead
he
was
notwithstanding
his
lameness
a
remarkably
healthy
youth
he
could
spear
a
salmon
with
the
best
fisher
on
the
tweed
and
ride
a
wild
horse
with
any
hunter
in
yarrow
when
devoting
himself
in
after
life
to
literary
pursuits
sir
walter
never
lost
his
taste
for
field
sports
but
while
writing
waverley
in
the
morning
he
would
in
the
afternoon
course
hares
professor
wilson
was
a
very
athlete
as
great
at
throwing
the
hammer
as
in
his
flights
of
eloquence
and
poetry
and
burns
when
a
youth
was
remarkable
chiefly
for
his
leaping
putting
and
wrestling
some
of
our
greatest
divines
were
distinguished
in
their
youth
for
their
physical
energies
isaac
barrow
when
at
the
charterhouse
school
was
notorious
for
his
pugilistic
encounters
in
which
he
got
many
a
bloody
nose
andrew
fuller
when
working
as
a
farmer
s
lad
at
soham
was
chiefly
famous
for
his
skill
in
boxing
and
adam
clarke
when
a
boy
was
only
remarkable
for
the
strength
displayed
by
him
in
rolling
large
stones
about
secret
possibly
of
some
of
the
power
which
he
subsequently
displayed
in
rolling
forth
large
thoughts
in
his
manhood
while
it
is
necessary
then
in
the
first
place
to
secure
this
solid
foundation
of
physical
health
it
must
also
be
observed
that
the
cultivation
of
the
habit
of
mental
application
is
quite
indispensable
for
the
education
of
the
student
the
maxim
that
labour
conquers
all
things
holds
especially
true
in
the
case
of
the
conquest
of
knowledge
the
road
into
learning
is
alike
free
to
all
who
will
give
the
labour
and
the
study
requisite
to
gather
it
nor
are
there
any
difficulties
so
great
that
the
student
of
resolute
purpose
may
not
surmount
and
overcome
them
it
was
one
of
the
characteristic
expressions
of
chatterton
that
god
had
sent
his
creatures
into
the
world
with
arms
long
enough
to
reach
anything
if
they
chose
to
be
at
the
trouble
in
study
as
in
business
energy
is
the
great
thing
there
must
be
the
fervet
opus
we
must
not
only
strike
the
iron
while
it
is
hot
but
strike
it
till
it
is
made
hot
it
is
astonishing
how
much
may
be
accomplished
in
by
the
energetic
and
the
persevering
who
are
careful
to
avail
themselves
of
opportunities
and
use
up
the
fragments
of
spare
time
which
the
idle
permit
to
run
to
waste
thus
ferguson
learnt
astronomy
from
the
heavens
while
wrapt
in
a
on
the
highland
hills
thus
stone
learnt
mathematics
while
working
as
a
journeyman
gardener
thus
drew
studied
the
highest
philosophy
in
the
intervals
of
cobbling
shoes
and
thus
miller
taught
himself
geology
while
working
as
a
day
labourer
in
a
quarry
sir
joshua
reynolds
as
we
have
already
observed
was
so
earnest
a
believer
in
the
force
of
industry
that
he
held
that
all
men
might
achieve
excellence
if
they
would
but
exercise
the
power
of
assiduous
and
patient
working
he
held
that
drudgery
lay
on
the
road
to
genius
and
that
there
was
no
limit
to
the
proficiency
of
an
artist
except
the
limit
of
his
own
painstaking
he
would
not
believe
in
what
is
called
inspiration
but
only
in
study
and
labour
excellence
he
said
is
never
granted
to
man
but
as
the
reward
of
if
you
have
great
talents
industry
will
improve
them
if
you
have
but
moderate
abilities
industry
will
supply
their
deficiency
nothing
is
denied
to
labour
nothing
is
to
be
obtained
without
sir
fowell
buxton
was
an
equal
believer
in
the
power
of
study
and
he
entertained
the
modest
idea
that
he
could
do
as
well
as
other
men
if
he
devoted
to
the
pursuit
double
the
time
and
labour
that
they
did
he
placed
his
great
confidence
in
ordinary
means
and
extraordinary
application
i
have
known
several
men
in
my
life
says
ross
who
may
be
recognized
in
days
to
come
as
men
of
genius
and
they
were
all
plodders
men
genius
is
known
by
its
works
genius
without
works
is
a
blind
faith
a
dumb
oracle
but
meritorious
works
are
the
result
of
time
and
labour
and
can
not
be
accomplished
by
intention
or
by
a
wish
every
great
work
is
the
result
of
vast
preparatory
training
facility
comes
by
labour
nothing
seems
easy
not
even
walking
that
was
not
difficult
at
first
the
orator
whose
eye
flashes
instantaneous
fire
and
whose
lips
pour
out
a
flood
of
noble
thoughts
startling
by
their
unexpectedness
and
elevating
by
their
wisdom
and
truth
has
learned
his
secret
by
patient
repetition
and
after
many
bitter
thoroughness
and
accuracy
are
two
principal
points
to
be
aimed
at
in
study
francis
horner
in
laying
down
rules
for
the
cultivation
of
his
mind
placed
great
stress
upon
the
habit
of
continuous
application
to
one
subject
for
the
sake
of
mastering
it
thoroughly
he
confined
himself
with
this
object
to
only
a
few
books
and
resisted
with
the
greatest
firmness
every
approach
to
a
habit
of
desultory
the
value
of
knowledge
to
any
man
consists
not
in
its
quantity
but
mainly
in
the
good
uses
to
which
he
can
apply
it
hence
a
little
knowledge
of
an
exact
and
perfect
character
is
always
found
more
valuable
for
practical
purposes
than
any
extent
of
superficial
learning
one
of
ignatius
loyola
s
maxims
was
he
who
does
well
one
work
at
a
time
does
more
than
by
spreading
our
efforts
over
too
large
a
surface
we
inevitably
weaken
our
force
hinder
our
progress
and
acquire
a
habit
of
fitfulness
and
ineffective
working
lord
leonards
once
communicated
to
sir
fowell
buxton
the
mode
in
which
he
had
conducted
his
studies
and
thus
explained
the
secret
of
his
success
i
resolved
said
he
when
beginning
to
read
law
to
make
everything
i
acquired
perfectly
my
own
and
never
to
go
to
a
second
thing
till
i
had
entirely
accomplished
the
first
many
of
my
competitors
read
as
much
in
a
day
as
i
read
in
a
week
but
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
my
knowledge
was
as
fresh
as
the
day
it
was
acquired
while
theirs
had
glided
away
from
it
is
not
the
quantity
of
study
that
one
gets
through
or
the
amount
of
reading
that
makes
a
wise
man
but
the
appositeness
of
the
study
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
pursued
the
concentration
of
the
mind
for
the
time
being
on
the
subject
under
consideration
and
the
habitual
discipline
by
which
the
whole
system
of
mental
application
is
regulated
abernethy
was
even
of
opinion
that
there
was
a
point
of
saturation
in
his
own
mind
and
that
if
he
took
into
it
something
more
than
it
could
hold
it
only
had
the
effect
of
pushing
something
else
out
speaking
of
the
study
of
medicine
he
said
if
a
man
has
a
clear
idea
of
what
he
desires
to
do
he
will
seldom
fail
in
selecting
the
proper
means
of
accomplishing
the
most
profitable
study
is
that
which
is
conducted
with
a
definite
aim
and
object
by
thoroughly
mastering
any
given
branch
of
knowledge
we
render
it
more
available
for
use
at
any
moment
hence
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
have
books
or
to
know
where
to
read
for
information
as
we
want
it
practical
wisdom
for
the
purposes
of
life
must
be
carried
about
with
us
and
be
ready
for
use
at
call
it
is
not
sufficient
that
we
have
a
fund
laid
up
at
home
but
not
a
farthing
in
the
pocket
we
must
carry
about
with
us
a
store
of
the
current
coin
of
knowledge
ready
for
exchange
on
all
occasions
else
we
are
comparatively
helpless
when
the
opportunity
for
using
it
occurs
decision
and
promptitude
are
as
requisite
in
as
in
business
the
growth
of
these
qualities
may
be
encouraged
by
accustoming
young
people
to
rely
upon
their
own
resources
leaving
them
to
enjoy
as
much
freedom
of
action
in
early
life
as
is
practicable
too
much
guidance
and
restraint
hinder
the
formation
of
habits
of
they
are
like
bladders
tied
under
the
arms
of
one
who
has
not
taught
himself
to
swim
want
of
confidence
is
perhaps
a
greater
obstacle
to
improvement
than
is
generally
imagined
it
has
been
said
that
half
the
failures
in
life
arise
from
pulling
in
one
s
horse
while
he
is
leaping
johnson
was
accustomed
to
attribute
his
success
to
confidence
in
his
own
powers
true
modesty
is
quite
compatible
with
a
due
estimate
of
one
s
own
merits
and
does
not
demand
the
abnegation
of
all
merit
though
there
are
those
who
deceive
themselves
by
putting
a
false
figure
before
their
ciphers
the
want
of
confidence
the
want
of
faith
in
one
s
self
and
consequently
the
want
of
promptitude
in
action
is
a
defect
of
character
which
is
found
to
stand
very
much
in
the
way
of
individual
progress
and
the
reason
why
so
little
is
done
is
generally
because
so
little
is
attempted
there
is
usually
no
want
of
desire
on
the
part
of
most
persons
to
arrive
at
the
results
of
but
there
is
a
great
aversion
to
pay
the
inevitable
price
for
it
of
hard
work
johnson
held
that
impatience
of
study
was
the
mental
disease
of
the
present
generation
and
the
remark
is
still
applicable
we
may
not
believe
that
there
is
a
royal
road
to
learning
but
we
seem
to
believe
very
firmly
in
a
popular
one
in
education
we
invent
processes
seek
short
cuts
to
science
learn
french
and
latin
in
twelve
lessons
or
without
a
we
resemble
the
lady
of
fashion
who
engaged
a
master
to
teach
her
on
condition
that
he
did
not
plague
her
with
verbs
and
participles
we
get
our
smattering
of
science
in
the
same
way
we
learn
chemistry
by
listening
to
a
short
course
of
lectures
enlivened
by
experiments
and
when
we
have
inhaled
laughing
gas
seen
green
water
turned
to
red
and
phosphorus
burnt
in
oxygen
we
have
got
our
smattering
of
which
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
though
it
may
be
better
than
nothing
it
is
yet
good
for
nothing
thus
we
often
imagine
we
are
being
educated
while
we
are
only
being
amused
the
facility
with
which
young
people
are
thus
induced
to
acquire
knowledge
without
study
and
labour
is
not
education
it
occupies
but
does
not
enrich
the
mind
it
imparts
a
stimulus
for
the
time
and
produces
a
sort
of
intellectual
keenness
and
cleverness
but
without
an
implanted
purpose
and
a
higher
object
than
mere
pleasure
it
will
bring
with
it
no
solid
advantage
in
such
cases
knowledge
produces
but
a
passing
impression
a
sensation
but
no
more
it
is
in
fact
the
merest
epicurism
of
but
certainly
not
intellectual
thus
the
best
qualities
of
many
minds
those
which
are
evoked
by
vigorous
effort
and
independent
action
sleep
a
deep
sleep
and
are
often
never
called
to
life
except
by
the
rough
awakening
of
sudden
calamity
or
suffering
which
in
such
cases
comes
as
a
blessing
if
it
serves
to
rouse
up
a
courageous
spirit
that
but
for
it
would
have
slept
on
accustomed
to
acquire
information
under
the
guise
of
amusement
young
people
will
soon
reject
that
which
is
presented
to
them
under
the
aspect
of
study
and
labour
learning
their
knowledge
and
science
in
sport
they
will
be
too
apt
to
make
sport
of
both
while
the
habit
of
intellectual
dissipation
thus
engendered
can
not
fail
in
course
of
time
to
produce
a
thoroughly
emasculating
effect
both
upon
their
mind
and
character
multifarious
reading
said
robertson
of
brighton
weakens
the
mind
like
smoking
and
is
an
excuse
for
its
lying
dormant
it
is
the
idlest
of
all
idlenesses
and
leaves
more
of
impotency
than
any
the
evil
is
a
growing
one
and
operates
in
various
ways
its
least
mischief
is
shallowness
its
greatest
the
aversion
to
steady
labour
which
it
induces
and
the
low
and
feeble
tone
of
mind
which
it
encourages
if
we
would
be
really
wise
we
must
diligently
apply
ourselves
and
confront
the
same
continuous
application
which
our
forefathers
did
for
labour
is
still
and
ever
will
be
the
inevitable
price
set
upon
everything
which
is
valuable
we
must
be
satisfied
to
work
with
a
purpose
and
wait
the
results
with
patience
all
progress
of
the
best
kind
is
slow
but
to
him
who
works
faithfully
and
zealously
the
reward
will
doubtless
be
vouchsafed
in
good
time
the
spirit
of
industry
embodied
in
a
man
s
daily
life
will
gradually
lead
him
to
exercise
his
powers
on
objects
outside
himself
of
greater
dignity
and
more
extended
usefulness
and
still
we
must
labour
on
for
the
work
of
is
never
finished
to
be
employed
said
the
poet
gray
is
to
be
it
is
better
to
wear
out
than
rust
out
said
bishop
cumberland
have
we
not
all
eternity
to
rest
in
exclaimed
arnauld
repos
ailleurs
was
the
motto
of
marnix
de
aldegonde
the
energetic
and
friend
of
william
the
silent
it
is
the
use
we
make
of
the
powers
entrusted
to
us
which
constitutes
our
only
just
claim
to
respect
he
who
employs
his
one
talent
aright
is
as
much
to
be
honoured
as
he
to
whom
ten
talents
have
been
given
there
is
really
no
more
personal
merit
attaching
to
the
possession
of
superior
intellectual
powers
than
there
is
in
the
succession
to
a
large
estate
how
are
those
powers
is
that
estate
employed
the
mind
may
accumulate
large
stores
of
knowledge
without
any
useful
purpose
but
the
knowledge
must
be
allied
to
goodness
and
wisdom
and
embodied
in
upright
character
else
it
is
naught
pestalozzi
even
held
intellectual
training
by
itself
to
be
pernicious
insisting
that
the
roots
of
all
knowledge
must
strike
and
feed
in
the
soil
of
the
will
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
may
it
is
true
protect
a
man
against
the
meaner
felonies
of
life
but
not
in
any
degree
against
its
selfish
vices
unless
fortified
by
sound
principles
and
habits
hence
do
we
find
in
daily
life
so
many
instances
of
men
who
are
in
intellect
but
utterly
deformed
in
character
filled
with
the
learning
of
the
schools
yet
possessing
little
practical
wisdom
and
offering
examples
for
warning
rather
than
imitation
an
often
quoted
expression
at
this
day
is
that
knowledge
is
power
but
so
also
are
fanaticism
despotism
and
ambition
knowledge
of
itself
unless
wisely
directed
might
merely
make
bad
men
more
dangerous
and
the
society
in
which
it
was
regarded
as
the
highest
good
little
better
than
a
pandemonium
it
is
possible
that
at
this
day
we
may
even
exaggerate
the
importance
of
literary
culture
we
are
apt
to
imagine
that
because
we
possess
many
libraries
institutes
and
museums
we
are
making
great
progress
but
such
facilities
may
as
often
be
a
hindrance
as
a
help
to
individual
of
the
highest
kind
the
possession
of
a
library
or
the
free
use
of
it
no
more
constitutes
learning
than
the
possession
of
wealth
constitutes
generosity
though
we
undoubtedly
possess
great
facilities
it
is
nevertheless
true
as
of
old
that
wisdom
and
understanding
can
only
become
the
possession
of
individual
men
by
travelling
the
old
road
of
observation
attention
perseverance
and
industry
the
possession
of
the
mere
materials
of
knowledge
is
something
very
different
from
wisdom
and
understanding
which
are
reached
through
a
higher
kind
of
discipline
than
that
of
reading
is
often
but
a
mere
passive
reception
of
other
men
s
thoughts
there
being
little
or
no
active
effort
of
mind
in
the
transaction
then
how
much
of
our
reading
is
but
the
indulgence
of
a
sort
of
intellectual
imparting
a
grateful
excitement
for
the
moment
without
the
slightest
effect
in
improving
and
enriching
the
mind
or
building
up
the
character
thus
many
indulge
themselves
in
the
conceit
that
they
are
cultivating
their
minds
when
they
are
only
employed
in
the
humbler
occupation
of
killing
time
of
which
perhaps
the
best
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
keeps
them
from
doing
worse
things
it
is
also
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
experience
gathered
from
books
though
often
valuable
is
but
of
the
nature
of
whereas
the
experience
gained
from
actual
life
is
of
the
nature
of
and
a
small
store
of
the
latter
is
worth
vastly
more
than
any
stock
of
the
former
lord
bolingbroke
truly
said
that
whatever
study
tends
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
to
make
us
better
men
and
citizens
is
at
best
but
a
specious
and
ingenious
sort
of
idleness
and
the
knowledge
we
acquire
by
it
only
a
creditable
kind
of
useful
and
instructive
though
good
reading
may
be
it
is
yet
only
one
mode
of
cultivating
the
mind
and
is
much
less
influential
than
practical
experience
and
good
example
in
the
formation
of
character
there
were
wise
valiant
and
men
bred
in
england
long
before
the
existence
of
a
reading
public
magna
charta
was
secured
by
men
who
signed
the
deed
with
their
marks
though
altogether
unskilled
in
the
art
of
deciphering
the
literary
signs
by
which
principles
were
denominated
upon
paper
they
yet
understood
and
appreciated
and
boldly
contended
for
the
things
themselves
thus
the
foundations
of
english
liberty
were
laid
by
men
who
though
illiterate
were
nevertheless
of
the
very
highest
stamp
of
character
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
chief
object
of
culture
is
not
merely
to
fill
the
mind
with
other
men
s
thoughts
and
to
be
the
passive
recipient
of
their
impressions
of
things
but
to
enlarge
our
individual
intelligence
and
render
us
more
useful
and
efficient
workers
in
the
sphere
of
life
to
which
we
may
be
called
many
of
our
most
energetic
and
useful
workers
have
been
but
sparing
readers
brindley
and
stephenson
did
not
learn
to
read
and
write
until
they
reached
manhood
and
yet
they
did
great
works
and
lived
manly
lives
john
hunter
could
barely
read
or
write
when
he
was
twenty
years
old
though
he
could
make
tables
and
chairs
with
any
carpenter
in
the
trade
i
never
read
said
the
great
physiologist
when
lecturing
before
his
class
this
to
some
part
of
the
subject
before
this
is
the
work
that
you
must
study
if
you
wish
to
become
eminent
in
your
when
told
that
one
of
his
contemporaries
had
charged
him
with
being
ignorant
of
the
dead
languages
he
said
i
would
undertake
to
teach
him
that
on
the
dead
body
which
he
never
knew
in
any
language
dead
or
it
is
not
then
how
much
a
man
may
know
that
is
of
importance
but
the
end
and
purpose
for
which
he
knows
it
the
object
of
knowledge
should
be
to
mature
wisdom
and
improve
character
to
render
us
better
happier
and
more
useful
more
benevolent
more
energetic
and
more
efficient
in
the
pursuit
of
every
high
purpose
in
life
when
people
once
fall
into
the
habit
of
admiring
and
encouraging
ability
as
such
without
reference
to
moral
religious
and
political
opinions
are
the
concrete
form
of
moral
are
on
the
highway
to
all
sorts
of
we
must
ourselves
and
and
not
rest
satisfied
merely
with
reading
and
meditating
over
what
other
men
have
been
and
done
our
best
light
must
be
made
life
and
our
best
thought
action
at
least
we
ought
to
be
able
to
say
as
richter
did
i
have
made
as
much
out
of
myself
as
could
be
made
of
the
stuff
and
no
man
should
require
more
for
it
is
every
man
s
duty
to
discipline
and
guide
himself
with
god
s
help
according
to
his
responsibilities
and
the
faculties
with
which
he
has
been
endowed
and
are
the
beginnings
of
practical
wisdom
and
these
must
have
their
root
in
hope
springs
from
which
is
the
companion
of
power
and
the
mother
of
success
for
whoso
hopes
strongly
has
within
him
the
gift
of
miracles
the
humblest
may
say
to
respect
myself
to
develop
is
my
true
duty
in
life
an
integral
and
responsible
part
of
the
great
system
of
society
i
owe
it
to
society
and
to
its
author
not
to
degrade
or
destroy
either
my
body
mind
or
instincts
on
the
contrary
i
am
bound
to
the
best
of
my
power
to
give
to
those
parts
of
my
constitution
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
possible
i
am
not
only
to
suppress
the
evil
but
to
evoke
the
good
elements
in
my
nature
and
as
i
respect
myself
so
am
i
equally
bound
to
respect
others
as
they
on
their
part
are
bound
to
respect
hence
mutual
respect
justice
and
order
of
which
law
becomes
the
written
record
and
guarantee
is
the
noblest
garment
with
which
a
man
may
clothe
most
elevating
feeling
with
which
the
mind
can
be
inspired
one
of
pythagoras
s
wisest
maxims
in
his
golden
verses
is
that
with
which
he
enjoins
the
pupil
to
reverence
borne
up
by
this
high
idea
he
will
not
defile
his
body
by
sensuality
nor
his
mind
by
servile
thoughts
this
sentiment
carried
into
daily
life
will
be
found
at
the
root
of
all
the
sobriety
chastity
morality
and
religion
the
pious
and
just
honouring
of
ourselves
said
milton
may
be
thought
the
radical
moisture
and
from
whence
every
laudable
and
worthy
enterprise
issues
to
think
meanly
of
one
s
self
is
to
sink
in
one
s
own
estimation
as
well
as
in
the
estimation
of
others
and
as
the
thoughts
are
so
will
the
acts
be
man
can
not
aspire
if
he
look
down
if
he
will
rise
he
must
look
up
the
very
humblest
may
be
sustained
by
the
proper
indulgence
of
this
feeling
poverty
itself
may
be
lifted
and
lighted
up
by
and
it
is
truly
a
noble
sight
to
see
a
poor
man
hold
himself
upright
amidst
his
temptations
and
refuse
to
demean
himself
by
low
actions
one
way
in
which
may
be
degraded
is
by
regarding
it
too
exclusively
as
a
means
of
getting
viewed
in
this
light
it
is
unquestionable
that
education
is
one
of
the
best
investments
of
time
and
labour
in
any
line
of
life
intelligence
will
enable
a
man
to
adapt
himself
more
readily
to
circumstances
suggest
improved
methods
of
working
and
render
him
more
apt
skilled
and
effective
in
all
respects
he
who
works
with
his
head
as
well
as
his
hands
will
come
to
look
at
his
business
with
a
clearer
eye
and
he
will
become
conscious
of
increasing
the
most
cheering
consciousness
the
human
mind
can
cherish
the
power
of
will
gradually
grow
and
in
proportion
to
a
man
s
will
he
be
armed
against
the
temptation
of
low
indulgences
society
and
its
action
will
be
regarded
with
quite
a
new
interest
his
sympathies
will
widen
and
enlarge
and
he
will
thus
be
attracted
to
work
for
others
as
well
as
for
himself
may
not
however
end
in
eminence
as
in
the
numerous
instances
above
cited
the
great
majority
of
men
in
all
times
however
enlightened
must
necessarily
be
engaged
in
the
ordinary
avocations
of
industry
and
no
degree
of
culture
which
can
be
conferred
upon
the
community
at
large
will
ever
enable
were
it
desirable
which
it
is
get
rid
of
the
daily
work
of
society
which
must
be
done
but
this
we
think
may
also
be
accomplished
we
can
elevate
the
condition
of
labour
by
allying
it
to
noble
thoughts
which
confer
a
grace
upon
the
lowliest
as
well
as
the
highest
rank
for
no
matter
how
poor
or
humble
a
man
may
be
the
great
thinker
of
this
and
other
days
may
come
in
and
sit
down
with
him
and
be
his
companion
for
the
time
though
his
dwelling
be
the
meanest
hut
it
is
thus
that
the
habit
of
reading
may
become
a
source
of
the
greatest
pleasure
and
and
exercise
a
gentle
coercion
with
the
most
beneficial
results
over
the
whole
tenour
of
a
man
s
character
and
conduct
and
even
though
may
not
bring
wealth
it
will
at
all
events
give
one
the
companionship
of
elevated
thoughts
a
nobleman
once
contemptuously
asked
of
a
sage
what
have
you
got
by
all
your
philosophy
at
least
i
have
got
society
in
myself
was
the
wise
man
s
reply
but
many
are
apt
to
feel
despondent
and
become
discouraged
in
the
work
of
because
they
do
not
get
on
in
the
world
so
fast
as
they
think
they
deserve
to
do
having
planted
their
acorn
they
expect
to
see
it
grow
into
an
oak
at
once
they
have
perhaps
looked
upon
knowledge
in
the
light
of
a
marketable
commodity
and
are
consequently
mortified
because
it
does
not
sell
as
they
expected
it
would
do
tremenheere
in
one
of
his
education
reports
for
states
that
a
schoolmaster
in
norfolk
finding
his
school
rapidly
falling
off
made
inquiry
into
the
cause
and
ascertained
that
the
reason
given
by
the
majority
of
the
parents
for
withdrawing
their
children
was
that
they
had
expected
education
was
to
make
them
better
off
than
they
were
before
but
that
having
found
it
had
done
them
no
good
they
had
taken
their
children
from
school
and
would
give
themselves
no
further
trouble
about
education
the
same
low
idea
of
is
but
too
prevalent
in
other
classes
and
is
encouraged
by
the
false
views
of
life
which
are
always
more
or
less
current
in
society
but
to
regard
either
as
a
means
of
getting
past
others
in
the
world
or
of
intellectual
dissipation
and
amusement
rather
than
as
a
power
to
elevate
the
character
and
expand
the
spiritual
nature
is
to
place
it
on
a
very
low
level
to
use
the
words
of
bacon
knowledge
is
not
a
shop
for
profit
or
sale
but
a
rich
storehouse
for
the
glory
of
the
creator
and
the
relief
of
man
s
it
is
doubtless
most
honourable
for
a
man
to
labour
to
elevate
himself
and
to
better
his
condition
in
society
but
this
is
not
to
be
done
at
the
sacrifice
of
himself
to
make
the
mind
the
mere
drudge
of
the
body
is
putting
it
to
a
very
servile
use
and
to
go
about
whining
and
bemoaning
our
pitiful
lot
because
we
fail
in
achieving
that
success
in
life
which
after
all
depends
rather
upon
habits
of
industry
and
attention
to
business
details
than
upon
knowledge
is
the
mark
of
a
small
and
often
of
a
sour
mind
such
a
temper
can
not
better
be
reproved
than
in
the
words
of
robert
southey
who
thus
wrote
to
a
friend
who
sought
his
counsel
i
would
give
you
advice
if
it
could
be
of
use
but
there
is
no
curing
those
who
choose
to
be
diseased
a
good
man
and
a
wise
man
may
at
times
be
angry
with
the
world
at
times
grieved
for
it
but
be
sure
no
man
was
ever
discontented
with
the
world
if
he
did
his
duty
in
it
if
a
man
of
education
who
has
health
eyes
hands
and
leisure
wants
an
object
it
is
only
because
god
almighty
has
bestowed
all
those
blessings
upon
a
man
who
does
not
deserve
another
way
in
which
education
may
be
prostituted
is
by
employing
it
as
a
mere
means
of
intellectual
dissipation
and
amusement
many
are
the
ministers
to
this
taste
in
our
time
there
is
almost
a
mania
for
frivolity
and
excitement
which
exhibits
itself
in
many
forms
in
our
popular
literature
to
meet
the
public
taste
our
books
and
periodicals
must
now
be
highly
spiced
amusing
and
comic
not
disdaining
slang
and
illustrative
of
breaches
of
all
laws
human
and
divine
douglas
jerrold
once
observed
of
this
tendency
i
am
convinced
the
world
will
get
tired
at
least
i
hope
so
of
this
eternal
guffaw
about
all
things
after
all
life
has
something
serious
in
it
it
can
not
be
all
a
comic
history
of
humanity
some
men
would
i
believe
write
a
comic
sermon
on
the
mount
think
of
a
comic
history
of
england
the
drollery
of
alfred
the
fun
of
sir
thomas
more
the
farce
of
his
daughter
begging
the
dead
head
and
clasping
it
in
her
coffin
on
her
bosom
surely
the
world
will
be
sick
of
this
john
sterling
in
a
like
spirit
said
periodicals
and
novels
are
to
all
in
this
generation
but
more
especially
to
those
whose
minds
are
still
unformed
and
in
the
process
of
formation
a
new
and
more
effectual
substitute
for
the
plagues
of
egypt
vermin
that
corrupt
the
wholesome
waters
and
infest
our
as
a
rest
from
toil
and
a
relaxation
from
graver
pursuits
the
perusal
of
a
story
by
a
writer
of
genius
is
a
high
intellectual
pleasure
and
it
is
a
description
of
literature
to
which
all
classes
of
readers
old
and
young
are
attracted
as
by
a
powerful
instinct
nor
would
we
have
any
of
them
debarred
from
its
enjoyment
in
a
reasonable
degree
but
to
make
it
the
exclusive
literary
diet
as
some
do
devour
the
garbage
with
which
the
shelves
of
circulating
libraries
are
filled
to
occupy
the
greater
portion
of
the
leisure
hours
in
studying
the
preposterous
pictures
of
human
life
which
so
many
of
them
present
is
worse
than
waste
of
time
it
is
positively
pernicious
the
habitual
indulges
in
fictitious
feelings
so
much
that
there
is
great
risk
of
sound
and
healthy
feeling
becoming
perverted
or
benumbed
i
never
go
to
hear
a
tragedy
said
a
gay
man
once
to
the
archbishop
of
york
it
wears
my
heart
the
literary
pity
evoked
by
fiction
leads
to
no
corresponding
action
the
susceptibilities
which
it
excites
involve
neither
inconvenience
nor
so
that
the
heart
that
is
touched
too
often
by
the
fiction
may
at
length
become
insensible
to
the
reality
the
steel
is
gradually
rubbed
out
of
the
character
and
it
insensibly
loses
its
vital
spring
drawing
fine
pictures
of
virtue
in
one
s
mind
said
bishop
butler
is
so
far
from
necessarily
or
certainly
conducive
to
form
a

who
thus
employs
himself
that
it
may
even
harden
the
mind
in
a
contrary
course
and
render
it
gradually
more
amusement
in
moderation
is
wholesome
and
to
be
commended
but
amusement
in
excess
vitiates
the
whole
nature
and
is
a
thing
to
be
carefully
guarded
against
the
maxim
is
often
quoted
of
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
but
all
play
and
no
work
makes
him
something
greatly
worse
nothing
can
be
more
hurtful
to
a
youth
than
to
have
his
soul
sodden
with
pleasure
the
best
qualities
of
his
mind
are
impaired
common
enjoyments
become
tasteless
his
appetite
for
the
higher
kind
of
pleasures
is
vitiated
and
when
he
comes
to
face
the
work
and
the
duties
of
life
the
result
is
usually
aversion
and
disgust
fast
men
waste
and
exhaust
the
powers
of
life
and
dry
up
the
sources
of
true
happiness
having
forestalled
their
spring
they
can
produce
no
healthy
growth
of
either
character
or
intellect
a
child
without
simplicity
a
maiden
without
innocence
a
boy
without
truthfulness
are
not
more
piteous
sights
than
the
man
who
has
wasted
and
thrown
away
his
youth
in
mirabeau
said
of
himself
my
early
years
have
already
in
a
great
measure
disinherited
the
succeeding
ones
and
dissipated
a
great
part
of
my
vital
as
the
wrong
done

another
returns
upon
ourselves
so
the
sins
of
our
youth
rise
up
in
our
age
to
scourge
us
when
lord
bacon
says
that
strength
of
nature
in
youth
passeth
over
many
excesses
which
are
owing
a
man
until
he
is
old
he
exposes
a
physical
as
well
as
a
moral
fact
which
can
not
be
too
well
weighed
in
the
conduct
of
life
i
assure
you
wrote
giusti
the
italian
to
a
friend
i
pay
a
heavy
price
for
existence
it
is
true
that
our
lives
are
not
at
our
own
disposal
nature
pretends
to
give
them
gratis
at
the
beginning
and
then
sends
in
her
the
worst
of
youthful
indiscretions
is
not
that
they
destroy
health
so
much
as
that
they
sully
manhood
the
dissipated
youth
becomes
a
tainted
man
and
often
he
can
not
be
pure
even
if
he
would
if

there
be
it
is
only
to
be

work
one
of
the
most
gifted
of
frenchmen
in
point
of
great
intellectual
endowments
was
benjamin
constant
but
at
twenty
his
life
was
only
a
prolonged
wail
instead
of
a
harvest
of
the
great
deeds
which
he
was
capable
of
accomplishing
with
ordinary
diligence
and
he
resolved
upon
doing
so
many
things
which
he
never
did
that
people
came
to
speak
of
him
as
constant
the
inconstant
he
was
a
fluent
and
brilliant
writer
and
cherished
the
ambition
of
writing
works
which
the
world
would
not
willingly
let
but
whilst
constant
affected
the
highest
thinking
unhappily
he
practised
the
lowest
living
nor
did
the
transcendentalism
of
his
books
atone
for
the
meanness
of
his
life
he
frequented
the
while
engaged
in
preparing
his
work
upon
religion
and
carried
on
a
disreputable
intrigue
while
writing
his
with
all
his
powers
of
intellect
he
was
powerless
because
he
had
no
faith
in
virtue
bah
said
he
what
are
honour
and
dignity
the
longer
i
live
the
more
clearly
i
see
there
is
nothing
in
it
was
the
howl
of
a
miserable
man
he
described
himself
as
but
ashes
and
i
pass
said
he
like
a
shadow
over
the
earth
accompanied
by
misery
and
he
wished
for
voltaire
s
energy
which
he
would
rather
have
possessed
than
his
genius
but
he
had
no
strength
of
but
wishes
his
life
prematurely
exhausted
had
become
but
a
heap
of
broken
links
he
spoke
of
himself
as
a
person
with
one
foot
in
the
air
he
admitted
that
he
had
no
principles
and
no
moral
consistency
hence
with
his
splendid
talents
he
contrived
to
do
nothing
and
after
living
many
years
miserable
he
died
worn
out
and
wretched
the
career
of
augustin
thierry
the
author
of
the
history
of
the
norman
conquest
affords
an
admirable
contrast
to
that
of
constant
his
entire
life
presented
a
striking
example
of
perseverance
diligence
self
culture
and
untiring
devotion
to
knowledge
in
the
pursuit
he
lost
his
eyesight
lost
his
health
but
never
lost
his
love
of
truth
when
so
feeble
that
he
was
carried
from
room
to
room
like
a
helpless
infant
in
the
arms
of
a
nurse
his
brave
spirit
never
failed
him
and
blind
and
helpless
though
he
was
he
concluded
his
literary
career
in
the
following
noble
words
if
as
i
think
the
interest
of
science
is
counted
in
the
number
of
great
national
interests
i
have
given
my
country
all
that
the
soldier
mutilated
on
the
field
of
battle
gives
her
whatever
may
be
the
fate
of
my
labours
this
example
i
hope
will
not
be
lost
i
would
wish
it
to
serve
to
combat
the
species
of
moral
weakness
which
is
of
our
present
generation
to
bring
back
into
the
straight
road
of
life
some
of
those
enervated
souls
that
complain
of
wanting
faith
that
know
not
what
to
do
and
seek
everywhere
without
finding
it
an
object
of
worship
and
admiration
why
say
with
so
much
bitterness
that
in
the
world
constituted
as
it
is
there
is
no
air
for
all
employment
for
all
minds
is
not
calm
and
serious
study
there
and
is
not
that
a
refuge
a
hope
a
field
within
the
reach
of
all
of
us
with
it
evil
days
are
passed
over
without
their
weight
being
felt
every
one
can
make
his
own
one
employ
his
life
nobly
this
is
what
i
have
done
and
would
do
again
if
i
had
to
recommence
my
career
i
would
choose
that
which
has
brought
me
where
i
am
blind
and
suffering
without
hope
and
almost
without
intermission
i
may
give
this
testimony
which
from
me
will
not
appear
suspicious
there
is
something
in
the
world
better
than
sensual
enjoyments
better
than
fortune
better
than
health
is
devotion
to
coleridge
in
many
respects
resembled
constant
he
possessed
equally
brilliant
powers
but
was
similarly
infirm
of
purpose
with
all
his
great
intellectual
gifts
he
wanted
the
gift
of
industry
and
was
averse
to
continuous
labour
he
wanted
also
the
sense
of
independence
and
thought
it
no
degradation
to
leave
his
wife
and
children
to
be
maintained
by
the
of
the
noble
southey
while
he
himself
retired
to
highgate
grove
to
discourse
transcendentalism
to
his
disciples
looking
down
contemptuously
upon
the
honest
work
going
forward
beneath
him
amidst
the
din
and
smoke
of
london
with
remunerative
employment
at
his
command
he
stooped
to
accept
the
charity
of
friends
and
notwithstanding
his
lofty
ideas
of
philosophy
he
condescended
to
humiliations
from
which
many
a
would
have
shrunk
how
different
in
spirit
was
southey
labouring
not
merely
at
work
of
his
own
choice
and
at
taskwork
often
tedious
and
distasteful
but
also
unremittingly
and
with
the
utmost
eagerness
seeking
and
storing
knowledge
purely
for
the
love
of
it
every
day
every
hour
had
its
allotted
employment
engagements
to
publishers

punctual
fulfilment

current
expenses
of

no

growing
while
his

lie
in
an
robert
nicoll
wrote
to
a
friend
after
reading
the
recollections
of
coleridge
what
a
mighty
intellect
was
lost
in
that
man
for
want
of
a
little
little
determination
nicoll
himself
was
a
true
and
brave
spirit
who
died
young
but
not
before
he
had
encountered
and
overcome
great
difficulties
in
life
at
his
outset
while
carrying
on
a
small
business
as
a
bookseller
he
found
himself
weighed
down
with
a
debt
of
only
twenty
pounds
which
he
said
he
felt
weighing
like
a
millstone
round
his
neck
and
that
if
he
had
it
paid
he
never
would
borrow
again
from
mortal
writing
to
his
mother
at
the
time
he
said
fear
not
for
me
dear
mother
for
i
feel
myself
daily
growing
firmer
and
more
hopeful
in
spirit
the
more
i
think
and
thinking
not
reading
is
now
my
feel
that
whether
i
be
growing
richer
or
not
i
am
growing
a
wiser
man
which
is
far
better
pain
poverty
and
all
the
other
wild
beasts
of
life
which
so
affrighten
others
i
am
so
bold
as
to
think
i
could
look
in
the
face
without
shrinking
without
losing
respect
for
myself
faith
in
man
s
high
destinies
or
trust
in
god
there
is
a
point
which
it
costs
much
mental
toil
and
struggling
to
gain
but
which
when
once
gained
a
man
can
look
down
from
as
a
traveller
from
a
lofty
mountain
on
storms
raging
below
while
he
is
walking
in
sunshine
that
i
have
yet
gained
this
point
in
life
i
will
not
say
but
i
feel
myself
daily
nearer
to
it
is
not
ease
but
facility
but
difficulty
that
makes
men
there
is
perhaps
no
station
in
life
in
which
difficulties
have
not
to
be
encountered
and
overcome
before
any
decided
measure
of
success
can
be
achieved
those
difficulties
are
however
our
best
instructors
as
our
mistakes
often
form
our
best
experience
charles
james
fox
was
accustomed
to
say
that
he
hoped
more
from
a
man
who
failed
and
yet
went
on
in
spite
of
his
failure
than
from
the
buoyant
career
of
the
successful
it
is
all
very
well
said
he
to
tell
me
that
a
young
man
has
distinguished
himself
by
a
brilliant
first
speech
he
may
go
on
or
he
may
be
satisfied
with
his
first
triumph
but
show
me
a
young
man
who
has
succeeded
at
first
and
nevertheless
has
gone
on
and
i
will
back
that
young
man
to
do
better
than
most
of
those
who
have
succeeded
at
the
first
we
learn
wisdom
from
failure
much
more
than
from
success
we
often
discover
what
do
by
finding
out
what
will
not
do
and
probably
he
who
never
made
a
mistake
never
made
a
discovery
it
was
the
failure
in
the
attempt
to
make
a
act
when
the
working
bucket
was
more
than
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
to
be
raised
that
led
observant
men
to
study
the
law
of
atmospheric
pressure
and
opened
a
new
field
of
research
to
the
genius
of
galileo
torrecelli
and
boyle
john
hunter
used
to
remark
that
the
art
of
surgery
would
not
advance
until
professional
men
had
the
courage
to
publish
their
failures
as
well
as
their
successes
watt
the
engineer
said
of

left
it
on
record
that
whenever
in
the
course
of
his
researches
he
encountered
an
apparently
insuperable
obstacle
he
generally
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
some

beethoven

of

that
he

in
him
the
stuff
to
have
made
a
good
musician
if
he
had
only
when
a
boy
been
well

that
he
had
been
spoilt
by
the
facility
with
which
he
produced

who

on

wellington
s
military
genius
was
perfected
by
encounter
with
difficulties
of
apparently
the
most
overwhelming
character
but
which
only
served
to
nerve
his
resolution
and
bring
out
more
prominently
his
great
qualities
as
a
man
and
a
general
so
the
skilful
mariner
obtains
his
best
experience
amidst
storms
and
tempests
which
train
him
to
courage
and
the
highest
discipline
and
we
probably
own
to
rough

and

of
our

who
are
certainly
not

by

necessity
may
be
a
hard
schoolmistress
but
she
is
generally
found
the
best
though
the
ordeal
of
adversity
is
one
from
which
we
naturally
shrink
yet
when
it
comes
we
must
bravely
and
manfully
encounter
it

and

be

right
severe

you

no

are
the
uses
of
they
reveal
to
us
our
powers
and
call
forth
our
energies
if
there
be
real
worth
in
the
character
like
sweet
herbs
it
will
give
forth
its
finest
fragrance
when
pressed
crosses
says
the
old
proverb
are
the
ladders
that
lead
to
what
is
even
poverty
itself
asks
richter
that
a
man
should
murmur
under

it

but
as
the
pain
of
piercing
a
maiden
s
ear
and
you
hang
precious
jewels
in
the
in
the
experience
of
life
it
is
found
that
the
wholesome
discipline
of
adversity
in
strong
natures
usually
carries
with
it
a
influence
many
are
found
capable
of
bravely
bearing
up
under
privations
and
cheerfully
encountering
obstructions
who
are
afterwards
found
unable
to
withstand
the
more
dangerous
influences
of
prosperity
it
is
only
a
weak
man
whom
the
wind
deprives
of
his
cloak
a
man
of
average
strength
is
more
in
danger
of
losing
it
when
assailed
by
the
beams
of
a
too
genial
sun
thus
it
often
needs
a
higher
discipline
and
a
stronger
character
to
bear
up
under
good
fortune
than
under
adverse
some
generous
natures
kindle
and
warm
with
prosperity
but
there
are
many
on
whom
wealth
has
no
such
influence
base
hearts
it
only
hardens
making
those
who
were
mean
and
servile
mean
and
proud
but
while
prosperity
is
apt
to
harden
the
heart
to
pride
adversity
in
a
man
of
resolution
will
serve
to
ripen
it
into
fortitude
to
use
the
words
of
burke
difficulty
is
a
severe
instructor
set
over
us
by
the
supreme
ordinance
of
a
parental
guardian
and
instructor
who
knows
us
better
than
we
know
ourselves
as
he
loves
us
better
too
he
that
wrestles
with
us
strengthens
our
nerves
and
sharpens
our
skill
our
antagonist
is
thus
our
without
the
necessity
of
encountering
difficulty
life
might
be
easier
but
men
would
be
worth
less
for
trials
wisely
improved
train
the
character
and
teach
thus
hardship
itself
may
often
prove
the
wholesomest
discipline
for
us
though
we
recognise
it
not
when
the
gallant
young
hodson
unjustly
removed
from
his
indian
command
felt
himself
sore
pressed
down
by
unmerited
calumny
and
reproach
he
yet
preserved
the
courage
to
say
to
a
friend
i
strive
to
look
the
worst
boldly
in
the
face
as
i
would
an
enemy
in
the
field
and
to
do
my
appointed
work
resolutely
and
to
the
best
of
my
ability
satisfied
that
there
is
a
reason
for
all
and
that
even
irksome
duties
well
done
bring
their
own
reward
and
that
if
not
still
they
the
battle
of
life
is
in
most
cases
fought
and
to
win
it
without
a
struggle
were
perhaps
to
win
it
without
honour
if
there
were
no
difficulties
there
would
be
no
success
if
there
were
nothing
to
struggle
for
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
achieved
difficulties
may
intimidate
the
weak
but
they
act
only
as
a
wholesome
stimulus
to
men
of
resolution
and
valour
all
experience
of
life
indeed
serves
to
prove
that
the
impediments
thrown
in
the
way
of
human
advancement
may
for
the
most
part
be
overcome
by
steady
good
conduct
honest
zeal
activity
perseverance
and
above
all
by
a
determined
resolution
to
surmount
difficulties
and
stand
up
manfully
against
misfortune
the
school
of
difficulty
is
the
best
school
of
moral
discipline
for
nations
as
for
individuals
indeed
the
history
of
difficulty
would
be
but
a
history
of
all
the
great
and
good
things
that
have
yet
been
accomplished
by
men
it
is
hard
to
say
how
much
northern
nations
owe
to
their
encounter
with
a
comparatively
rude
and
changeable
climate
and
an
originally
sterile
soil
which
is
one
of
the
necessities
of
their
condition
a
perennial
struggle
with
difficulties
such
as
the
natives
of
sunnier
climes
know
nothing
of
and
thus
it
may
be
that
though
our
finest
products
are
exotic
the
skill
and
industry
which
have
been
necessary
to
rear
them
have
issued
in
the
production
of
a
native
growth
of
men
not
surpassed
on
the
globe
wherever
there
is
difficulty
the
individual
man
must
come
out
for
better
for
worse
encounter
with
it
will
train
his
strength
and
discipline
his
skill
heartening
him
for
future
effort
as
the
racer
by
being
trained
to
run
against
the
hill
at
length
courses
with
facility
the
road
to
success
may
be
steep
to
climb
and
it
puts
to
the
proof
the
energies
of
him
who
would
reach
the
summit
but
by
experience
a
man
soon
learns
that
obstacles
are
to
be
overcome
by
grappling
with
them
the
nettle
feels
as
soft
as
silk
when
it
is
boldly
grasped
that
the
most
effective
help
towards
realizing
the
object
proposed
is
the
moral
conviction
that
we
can
and
will
accomplish
it
thus
difficulties
often
fall
away
of
themselves
before
the
determination
to
overcome
them
much
will
be
done
if
we
do
but
try
nobody
knows
what
he
can
do
till
he
has
tried
and
few
try
their
best
till
they
have
been
forced
to
do
it
i
could
do
such
and
such
a
thing
sighs
the
desponding
youth
but
nothing
will
be
done
if
he
only
wishes
the
desire
must
ripen
into
purpose
and
effort
and
one
energetic
attempt
is
worth
a
thousand
aspirations
it
is
these
thorny
ifs
mutterings
of
impotence
and
so
often
hedge
round
the
field
of
possibility
and
prevent
anything
being
done
or
even
attempted
a
difficulty
said
lord
lyndhurst
is
a
thing
to
be
overcome
grapple
with
it
at
once
facility
will
come
with
practice
and
strength
and
fortitude
with
repeated
effort
thus
the
mind
and
character
may
be
trained
to
an
almost
perfect
discipline
and
enabled
to
act
with
a
grace
spirit
and
liberty
almost
incomprehensible
to
those
who
have
not
passed
through
a
similar
experience
everything
that
we
learn
is
the
mastery
of
a
difficulty
and
the
mastery
of
one
helps
to
the
mastery
of
others
things
which
may
at
first
sight
appear
comparatively
valueless
in
as
the
study
of
the
dead
languages
and
the
relations
of
lines
and
surfaces
which
we
call
really
of
the
greatest
practical
value
not
so
much
because
of
the
information
which
they
yield
as
because
of
the
development
which
they
compel
the
mastery
of
these
studies
evokes
effort
and
cultivates
powers
of
application
which
otherwise
might
have
lain
dormant
thus
one
thing
leads
to
another
and
so
the
work
goes
on
through
with
difficulty
ending
only
when
life
and
culture
end
but
indulging
in
the
feeling
of
discouragement
never
helped
any
one
over
a
difficulty
and
never
will

about

exclaimed
ah
you
little
know
with
what
difficulty
this
ease
has
been
sir
joshua
reynolds
when
once
asked
how
long
it
had
taken
him
to
paint
a
certain
picture
replied
all
my
henry
clay
the
american
orator
when
giving
advice
to
young
men
thus
described
to
them
the
secret
of
his
success
in
the
cultivation
of
his
art
i
owe
my
success
in
life
said
he
chiefly
to
one
at
the
age
of
i
commenced
and
continued
for
years
the
process
of
daily
reading
and
speaking
upon
the
contents
of
some
historical
or
scientific
book
these
efforts
were
made
sometimes
in
a
cornfield
at
others
in
the
forest
and
not
unfrequently
in
some
distant
barn
with
the
horse
and
the
ox
for
my
auditors
it
is
to
this
early
practice
of
the
art
of
all
arts
that
i
am
indebted
for
the
primary
and
leading
impulses
that
stimulated
me
onward
and
have
shaped
and
moulded
my
whole
subsequent
curran
the
irish
orator
when
a
youth
had
a
strong
defect
in
his
articulation
and
at
school
he
was
known
as
stuttering
jack
while
he
was
engaged
in
the
study
of
the
law
and
still
struggling
to
overcome
his
defect
he
was
stung
into
eloquence
by
the
sarcasms
of
a
member
of
a
debating
club
who
characterised
him
as
orator
mum
for
like
cowper
when
he
stood
up
to
speak
on
a
previous
occasion
curran
had
not
been
able
to
utter
a
word
the
taunt
stung
him
and
he
replied
in
a
triumphant
speech
this
accidental
discovery
in
himself
of
the
gift
of
eloquence
encouraged
him
to
proceed
in
his
studies
with
renewed
energy
he
corrected
his
enunciation
by
reading
aloud
emphatically
and
distinctly
the
best
passages
in
literature
for
several
hours
every
day
studying
his
features
before
a
mirror
and
adopting
a
method
of
gesticulation
suited
to
his
rather
awkward
and
ungraceful
figure
he
also
proposed
cases
to
himself
which
he
argued
with
as
much
care
as
if
he
had
been
addressing
a
jury
curran
began
business
with
the
qualification
which
lord
eldon
stated
to
be
the
first
requisite
for
distinction
that
is
to
be
not
worth
a
while
working
his
way
laboriously
at
the
bar
still
oppressed
by
the
diffidence
which
had
overcome
him
in
his
debating
club
he
was
on
one
occasion
provoked
by
the
judge
robinson
into
making
a
very
severe
retort
in
the
case
under
discussion
curran
observed
that
he
had
never
met
the
law
as
laid
down
by
his
lordship
in
any
book
in
his
that
may
be
sir
said
the
judge
in
a
contemptuous
tone
but
i
suspect
that
library
is
very
his
lordship
was
notoriously
a
furious
political
partisan
the
author
of
several
anonymous
pamphlets
characterised
by
unusual
violence
and
dogmatism
curran
roused
by
the
allusion
to
his
straitened
circumstances
replied
thus
it
is
very
true
my
lord
that
i
am
poor
and
the
circumstance
has
certainly
curtailed
my
library
my
books
are
not
numerous
but
they
are
select
and
i
hope
they
have
been
perused
with
proper
dispositions
i
have
prepared
myself
for
this
high
profession
by
the
study
of
a
few
good
works
rather
than
by
the
composition
of
a
great
many
bad
ones
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
poverty
but
i
should
be
ashamed
of
my
wealth
could
i
have
stooped
to
acquire
it
by
servility
and
corruption
if
i
rise
not
to
rank
i
shall
at
least
be
honest
and
should
i
ever
cease
to
be
so
many
an
example
shows
me
that
an
elevation
by
making
me
the
more
conspicuous
would
only
make
me
the
more
universally
and
the
more
notoriously
the
extremest
poverty

to
write

scribbling

letters

only
book
which
his

who
was

shepherd
possessed

valuable

when
a

borrowed

and
copied
the
whole
of
it
with

many
poor

while
labouring
daily
for
their
living
have
only
been
able
to
snatch
an
atom
of
knowledge
here
and
there
at
intervals

birds
do
their

a
author
and
publisher
william
chambers
of
edinburgh
speaking
before
an
assemblage
of
young
men
in
that
city
thus
briefly
described
to
them
his
humble
beginnings
for
their
encouragement
i
stand
before
you
he
said
a
man
my
education
was
that
which
is
supplied
at
the
humble
parish
schools
of
scotland
and
it
was
only
when
i
went
to
edinburgh
a
poor
boy
that
i
devoted
my
evenings
after
the
labours
of
the
day
to
the
cultivation
of
that
intellect
which
the
almighty
has
given
me
from
seven
or
eight
in
the
morning
till
nine
or
ten
at
night
was
i
at
my
business
as
a
bookseller
s
apprentice
and
it
was
only
during
hours
after
these
stolen
from
sleep
that
i
could
devote
myself
to
study
i
did
not
read
novels
my
attention
was
devoted
to
physical
science
and
other
useful
matters
i
also
taught
myself
french
i
look
back
to
those
times
with
great
pleasure
and
am
almost
sorry
i
have
not
to
go
through
the
same
experience
again
for
i
reaped
more
pleasure
when
i
had
not
a
sixpence
in
my
pocket
studying
in
a
garret
in
edinburgh
then
i
now
find
when
sitting
amidst
all
the
elegancies
and
comforts
of
a
william
cobbett
s
account
of
how
he
learnt
english
grammar
is
full
of
interest
and
instruction
for
all
students
labouring
under
difficulties
i
learned
grammar
said
he
when
i
was
a
private
soldier
on
the
pay
of
sixpence
a
day
the
edge
of
my
berth
or
that
of
my
was
my
seat
to
study
in
my
knapsack
was
my
a
bit
of
board
lying
on
my
lap
was
my
and
the
task
did
not
demand
anything
like
a
year
of
my
life
i
had
no
money
to
purchase
candle
or
oil
in
winter
time
it
was
rarely
that
i
could
get
any
evening
light
but
that
of
the
fire
and
only
my
turn
even
of
that
and
if
i
under
such
circumstances
and
without
parent
or
friend
to
advise
or
encourage
me
accomplished
this
undertaking
what
excuse
can
there
be
for
any
youth
however
poor
however
pressed
with
business
or
however
circumstanced
as
to
room
or
other
conveniences
to
buy
a
pen
or
a
sheet
of
paper
i
was
compelled
to
forego
some
portion
of
food
though
in
a
state
of
i
had
no
moment
of
time
that
i
could
call
my
own
and
i
had
to
read
and
to
write
amidst
the
talking
laughing
singing
whistling
and
brawling
of
at
least
half
a
score
of
the
most
thoughtless
of
men
and
that
too
in
the
hours
of
their
freedom
from
all
control
think
not
lightly
of
the
farthing
that
i
had
to
give
now
and
then
for
ink
pen
or
paper
that
farthing
was
alas
a
great
sum
to
me
i
was
as
tall
as
i
am
now
i
had
great
health
and
great
exercise
the
whole
of
the
money
not
expended
for
us
at
market
was
a
week
for
each
man
i
remember
and
well
i
may
that
on
one
occasion
i
after
all
necessary
expenses
had
on
a
friday
made
shifts
to
have
a
halfpenny
in
reserve
which
i
had
destined
for
the
purchase
of
a
redherring
in
the
morning
but
when
i
pulled
off
my
clothes
at
night
so
hungry
then
as
to
be
hardly
able
to
endure
life
i
found
that
i
had
lost
my
halfpenny
i
buried
my
head
under
the
miserable
sheet
and
rug
and
cried
like
a
child
and
again
i
say
if
i
under
circumstances
like
these
could
encounter
and
overcome
this
task
is
there
can
there
be
in
the
whole
world
a
youth
to
find
an
excuse
for
the
we
have
been
informed
of
an
equally
striking
instance
of
perseverance
and
application
in
learning
on
the
part
of
a
french
political
exile
in
london
his
original
occupation
was
that
of
a
stonemason
at
which
he
found
employment
for
some
time
but
work
becoming
slack
he
lost
his
place
and
poverty
stared
him
in
the
face
in
his
dilemma
he
called
upon
a
fellow
exile
profitably
engaged
in
teaching
french
and
consulted
him
what
he
ought
to
do
to
earn
a
living
the
answer
was
become
a
professor
a
professor
answered
the
i
who
am
only
a
workman
speaking
but
a
patois
surely
you
are
jesting
on
the
contrary
i
am
quite
serious
said
the
other
and
again
i
advise
a
professor
place
yourself
under
me
and
i
will
undertake
to
teach
you
how
to
teach
no
no
replied
the
mason
it
is
impossible
i
am
too
old
to
learn
i
am
too
little
of
a
scholar
i
can
not
be
a
he
went
away
and
again
he
tried
to
obtain
employment
at
his
trade
from
london
he
went
into
the
provinces
and
travelled
several
hundred
miles
in
vain
he
could
not
find
a
master
returning
to
london
he
went
direct
to
his
former
adviser
and
said
i
have
tried
everywhere
for
work
and
failed
i
will
now
try
to
be
a
professor
he
immediately
placed
himself
under
instruction
and
being
a
man
of
close
application
of
quick
apprehension
and
vigorous
intelligence
he
speedily
mastered
the
elements
of
grammar
the
rules
of
construction
and
composition
and
what
he
had
still
in
a
great
measure
to
learn
the
correct
pronunciation
of
classical
french
when
his
friend
and
instructor
thought
him
sufficiently
competent
to
undertake
the
teaching
of
others
an
appointment
advertised
as
vacant
was
applied
for
and
obtained
and
behold
our
artisan
at
length
become
professor
it
so
happened
that
the
seminary
to
which
he
was
appointed
was
situated
in
a
suburb
of
london
where
he
had
formerly
worked
as
a
stonemason
and
every
morning
the
first
thing
which
met
his
eyes
on
looking
out
of
his
window
was
a
stack
of
cottage
chimneys
which
he
had
himself
built
he
feared
for
a
time
lest
he
should
be
recognised
in
the
village
as
the
quondam
workman
and
thus
bring
discredit
on
his
seminary
which
was
of
high
standing
but
he
need
have
been
under
no
such
apprehension
as
he
proved
a
most
efficient
teacher
and
his
pupils
were
on
more
than
one
occasion
publicly
complimented
for
their
knowledge
of
french
meanwhile
he
secured
the
respect
and
friendship
of
all
who
knew
as
well
as
pupils
and
when
the
story
of
his
struggles
his
difficulties
and
his
past
history
became
known
to
them
they
admired
him
more
than
ever
sir
samuel
romilly
was
not
less
indefatigable
as
a
the
son
of
a
jeweller
descended
from
a
french
refugee
he
received
little
education
in
his
early
years
but
overcame
all
his
disadvantages
by
unwearied
application
and
by
efforts
constantly
directed
towards
the
same
end
i
determined
he
says
in
his
autobiography
when
i
was
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
of
age
to
apply
myself
seriously
to
learning
latin
of
which
i
at
that
time
knew
little
more
than
some
of
the
most
familiar
rules
of
grammar
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
years
during
which
i
thus
applied
myself
i
had
read
almost
every
prose
writer
of
the
age
of
pure
latinity
except
those
who
have
treated
merely
of
technical
subjects
such
as
varro
columella
and
celsus
i
had
gone
three
times
through
the
whole
of
livy
sallust
and
tacitus
i
had
studied
the
most
celebrated
orations
of
cicero
and
translated
a
great
deal
of
homer
terence
virgil
horace
ovid
and
juvenal
i
had
read
over
and
over
he
also
studied
geography
natural
history
and
natural
philosophy
and
obtained
a
considerable
acquaintance
with
general
knowledge
at
sixteen
he
was
articled
to
a
clerk
in
chancery
worked
hard
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
his
industry
and
perseverance
ensured
success
he
became
under
the
fox
administration
in
and
steadily
worked
his
way
to
the
highest
celebrity
in
his
profession
yet
he
was
always
haunted
by
a
painful
and
almost
oppressive
sense
of
his
own
disqualifications
and
never
ceased
labouring
to
remedy
them
his
autobiography
is
a
lesson
of
instructive
facts
worth
volumes
of
sentiment
and
well
deserves
a
careful
perusal
sir
walter
scott
was
accustomed
to
cite
the
case
of
his
young
friend
john
leyden
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
illustrations
of
the
power
of
perseverance
which
he
had
ever
known
the
son
of
a
shepherd
in
one
of
the
wildest
valleys
of
roxburghshire
he
was
almost
entirely
self
educated
like
many
scotch
shepherds
hogg
who
taught
himself
to
write
by
copying
the
letters
of
a
printed
book
as
he
lay
watching
his
flock
on
the
cairns
who
from
tending
sheep
on
the
lammermoors
raised
himself
by
dint
of
application
and
industry
to
the
professor
s
chair
which
he
now
so
worthily
murray
ferguson
and
many
more
leyden
was
early
inspired
by
a
thirst
for
knowledge
when
a
poor
barefooted
boy
he
walked
six
or
eight
miles
across
the
moors
daily
to
learn
reading
at
the
little
village
schoolhouse
of
kirkton
and
this
was
all
the
education
he
received
the
rest
he
acquired
for
himself
he
found
his
way
to
edinburgh
to
attend
the
college
there
setting
the
extremest
penury
at
defiance
he
was
first
discovered
as
a
frequenter
of
a
small
bookseller
s
shop
kept
by
archibald
constable
afterwards
so
well
known
as
a
publisher
he
would
pass
hour
after
hour
perched
on
a
ladder
in
with
some
great
folio
in
his
hand
forgetful
of
the
scanty
meal
of
bread
and
water
which
awaited
him
at
his
miserable
lodging
access
to
books
and
lectures
comprised
all
within
the
bounds
of
his
wishes
thus
he
toiled
and
battled
at
the
gates
of
science
until
his
unconquerable
perseverance
carried
everything
before
it
before
he
had
attained
his
nineteenth
year
he
had
astonished
all
the
professors
in
edinburgh
by
his
profound
knowledge
of
greek
and
latin
and
the
general
mass
of
information
he
had
acquired
having
turned
his
views
to
india
he
sought
employment
in
the
civil
service
but
failed
he
was
however
informed
that
a
surgeon
s
assistant
s
commission
was
open
to
him
but
he
was
no
surgeon
and
knew
no
more
of
the
profession
than
a
child
he
could
however
learn
then
he
was
told
that
he
must
be
ready
to
pass
in
six
months
nothing
daunted
he
set
to
work
to
acquire
in
six
months
what
usually
required
three
years
at
the
end
of
six
months
he
took
his
degree
with
honour
scott
and
a
few
friends
helped
to
fit
him
out
and
he
sailed
for
india
after
publishing
his
beautiful
poem
the
scenes
of
in
india
he
promised
to
become
one
of
the
greatest
of
oriental
scholars
but
was
unhappily
cut
off
by
fever
caught
by
exposure
and
died
at
an
early
age
the
life
of
the
late
lee
professor
of
hebrew
at
cambridge
furnishes
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
in
modern
times
of
the
power
of
patient
perseverance
and
resolute
purpose
in
working
out
an
honourable
career
in
literature
he
received
his
education
at
a
charity
school
at
lognor
near
shrewsbury
but
so
little
distinguished
himself
there
that
his
master
pronounced
him
one
of
the
dullest
boys
that
ever
passed
through
his
hands
he
was
put
apprentice
to
a
carpenter
and
worked
at
that
trade
until
he
arrived
at
manhood
to
occupy
his
leisure
hours
he
took
to
reading
and
some
of
the
books
containing
latin
quotations
he
became
desirous
of
ascertaining
what
they
meant
he
bought
a
latin
grammar
and
proceeded
to
learn
latin
as
stone
the
duke
of
argyle
s
gardener
said
long
before
does
one
need
to
know
anything
more
than
the
letters
in
order
to
learn
everything
else
that
one
wishes
lee
rose
early
and
sat
up
late
and
he
succeeded
in
mastering
the
latin
before
his
apprenticeship
was
out
whilst
working
one
day
in
some
place
of
worship
a
copy
of
a
greek
testament
fell
in
his
way
and
he
was
immediately
filled
with
the
desire
to
learn
that
language
he
accordingly
sold
some
of
his
latin
books
and
purchased
a
greek
grammar
and
lexicon
taking
pleasure
in
learning
he
soon
mastered
the
language
then
he
sold
his
greek
books
and
bought
hebrew
ones
and
learnt
that
language
unassisted
by
any
instructor
without
any
hope
of
fame
or
reward
but
simply
following
the
bent
of
his
genius
he
next
proceeded
to
learn
the
chaldee
syriac
and
samaritan
dialects
but
his
studies
began
to
tell
upon
his
health
and
brought
on
disease
in
his
eyes
through
his
long
night
watchings
with
his
books
having
laid
them
aside
for
a
time
and
recovered
his
health
he
went
on
with
his
daily
work
his
character
as
a
tradesman
being
excellent
his
business
improved
and
his
means
enabled
him
to
marry
which
he
did
when
years
old
he
determined
now
to
devote
himself
to
the
maintenance
of
his
family
and
to
renounce
the
luxury
of
literature
accordingly
he
sold
all
his
books
he
might
have
continued
a
working
carpenter
all
his
life
had
not
the
chest
of
tools
upon
which
he
depended
for
subsistence
been
destroyed
by
fire
and
destitution
stared
him
in
the
face
he
was
too
poor
to
buy
new
tools
so
he
bethought
him
of
teaching
children
their
letters
profession
requiring
the
least
possible
capital
but
though
he
had
mastered
many
languages
he
was
so
defective
in
the
common
branches
of
knowledge
that
at
first
he
could
not
teach
them
resolute
of
purpose
however
he
assiduously
set
to
work
and
taught
himself
arithmetic
and
writing
to
such
a
degree
as
to
be
able
to
impart
the
knowledge
of
these
branches
to
little
children
his
unaffected
simple
and
beautiful
character
gradually
attracted
friends
and
the
acquirements
of
the
learned
carpenter
became
bruited
abroad
scott
a
neighbouring
clergyman
obtained
for
him
the
appointment
of
master
of
a
charity
school
in
shrewsbury
and
introduced
him
to
a
distinguished
oriental
scholar
these
friends
supplied
him
with
books
and
lee
successively
mastered
arabic
persic
and
hindostanee
he
continued
to
pursue
his
studies
while
on
duty
as
a
private
in
the
local
militia
of
the
county
gradually
acquiring
greater
proficiency
in
languages
at
length
his
kind
patron
scott
enabled
lee
to
enter
queen
s
college
cambridge
and
after
a
course
of
study
in
which
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
mathematical
acquirements
a
vacancy
occurring
in
the
professorship
of
arabic
and
hebrew
he
was
worthily
elected
to
fill
the
honourable
office
besides
ably
performing
his
duties
as
a
professor
he
voluntarily
gave
much
of
his
time
to
the
instruction
of
missionaries
going
forth
to
preach
the
gospel
to
eastern
tribes
in
their
own
tongue
he
also
made
translations
of
the
bible
into
several
asiatic
dialects
and
having
mastered
the
new
zealand
language
he
arranged
a
grammar
and
vocabulary
for
two
new
zealand
chiefs
who
were
then
in
england
which
books
are
now
in
daily
use
in
the
new
zealand
schools
such
in
brief
is
the
remarkable
history
of
samuel
lee
and
it
is
but
the
counterpart
of
numerous
similarly
instructive
examples
of
the
power
of
perseverance
in
as
displayed
in
the
lives
of
many
of
the
most
distinguished
of
our
literary
and
scientific
men
there
are
many
other
illustrious
names
which
might
be
cited
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
common
saying
that
it
is
never
too
late
to
even
at
advanced
years
men
can
do
much
if
they
will
determine
on
making
a
beginning
sir
henry
spelman
did
not
begin
the
study
of
science
until
he
was
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
franklin
was
fifty
before
he
fully
entered
upon
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
dryden
and
scott
were
not
known
as
authors
until
each
was
in
his
fortieth
year
boccaccio
was
when
he
commenced
his
literary
career
and
alfieri
was
when
he
began
the
study
of
greek
arnold
learnt
german
at
an
advanced
age
for
the
purpose
of
reading
niebuhr
in
the
original
and
in
like
manner
james
watt
when
about
forty
while
working
at
his
trade
of
an
instrument
maker
in
glasgow
learnt
french
german
and
italian
to
enable
himself
to
peruse
the
valuable
works
on
mechanical
philosophy
which
existed
in
those
languages
thomas
scott
was
before
he
began
to
learn
hebrew
robert
hall
was
once
found
lying
upon
the
floor
racked
by
pain
learning
italian
in
his
old
age
to
enable
him
to
judge
of
the
parallel
drawn
by
macaulay
between
milton
and
dante
handel
was
before
he
published
any
of
his
great
works
indeed
hundreds
of
instances
might
be
given
of
men
who
struck
out
an
entirely
new
path
and
successfully
entered
on
new
studies
at
a
comparatively
advanced
time
of
life
none
but
the
frivolous
or
the
indolent
will
say
i
am
too
old
to
and
here
we
would
repeat
what
we
have
said
before
that
it
is
not
men
of
genius
who
move
the
world
and
take
the
lead
in
it
so
much
as
men
of
steadfastness
purpose
and
indefatigable
industry
notwithstanding
the
many
undeniable
instances
of
the
precocity
of
men
of
genius
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
early
cleverness
gives
no
indication
of
the
height
to
which
the
grown
man
will
reach
precocity
is
sometimes
a
symptom
of
disease
rather
than
of
intellectual
vigour
what
becomes
of
all
the
remarkably
clever
children
where
are
the
duxes
and
prize
boys
trace
them
through
life
and
it
will
frequently
be
found
that
the
dull
boys
who
were
beaten
at
school
have
shot
ahead
of
them
the
clever
boys
are
rewarded
but
the
prizes
which
they
gain
by
their
greater
quickness
and
facility
do
not
always
prove
of
use
to
them
what
ought
rather
to
be
rewarded
is
the
endeavour
the
struggle
and
the
obedience
for
it
is
the
youth
who
does
his
best
though
endowed
with
an
inferiority
of
natural
powers
that
ought
above
all
others
to
be
encouraged
an
interesting
chapter
might
be
written
on
the
subject
of
illustrious
boys
but
brilliant
men
we
have
room
however
for
only
a
few
instances
pietro
di
cortona
the
painter
was
thought
so
stupid
that
he
was
nicknamed
ass
s
head
when
a
boy
and
tomaso
guidi
was
generally
known
as
heavy
tom
massaccio
tomasaccio
though
by
diligence
he
afterwards
raised
himself
to
the
highest
eminence

at
school
stood
at
the
bottom
of

lowest

he
was
however
equally
remarkable
for
his

him
he
never
left
it
until
he
had
mastered

did
he
ever
feign
to
possess

which
he
had
not

acquired

again

the
result
was
that

seventy

was
probably
in
the
whole
class
not
a
boy

whom

at

was
not

in

and
attainments

at

end
of

his

once
said
of
him
while

with
me
i
could
not
discern
the
faculties
by
which
he
was
so
much
indeed
davy
himself
in

considered
it
fortunate
that
he
had
been
left
to
enjoy
so
much
idleness
at
school
watt
was
a
dull
scholar
notwithstanding
the
stories
told
about
his
precocity
but
he
was
what
was
better
patient
and
perseverant
and
it
was
by
such
qualities
and
by
his
carefully
cultivated
inventiveness
that
he
was
enabled
to
perfect
his
what
arnold
said
of
boys
is
equally
true
of
the
difference
between
one
boy
and
another
consists
not
so
much
in
talent
as
in
energy
given
perseverance
and
energy
soon
becomes
habitual
provided
the
dunce
has
persistency
and
application
he
will
inevitably
head
the
cleverer
fellow
without
those
qualities
slow
but
sure
wins
the
race
it
is
perseverance
that
explains
how
the
position
of
boys
at
school
is
so
often
reversed
in
real
life
and
it
is
curious
to
note
how
some
who
were
then
so
clever
have
since
become
so
commonplace
whilst
others
dull
boys
of
whom
nothing
was
expected
slow
in
their
faculties
but
sure
in
their
pace
have
assumed
the
position
of
leaders
of
men
the
author
of
this
book
when
a
boy
stood
in
the
same
class
with
one
of
the
greatest
of
dunces
one
teacher
after
another
had
tried
his
skill
upon
him
and
failed
corporal
punishment
the
fool
s
cap
coaxing
and
earnest
entreaty
proved
alike
fruitless
sometimes
the
experiment
was
tried
of
putting
him
at
the
top
of
his
class
and
it
was
curious
to
note
the
rapidity
with
which
he
gravitated
to
the
inevitable
bottom
the
youth
was
given
up
by
his
teachers
as
an
incorrigible
of
them
pronouncing
him
to
be
a
stupendous
yet
slow
though
he
was
this
dunce
had
a
sort
of
dull
energy
of
purpose
in
him
which
grew
with
his
muscles
and
his
manhood
and
strange
to
say
when
he
at
length
came
to
take
part
in
the
practical
business
of
life
he
was
found
heading
most
of
his
school
companions
and
eventually
left
the
greater
number
of
them
far
behind
the
last
time
the
author
heard
of
him
he
was
chief
magistrate
of
his
native
town
the
tortoise
in
the
right
road
will
beat
a
racer
in
the
wrong
it
matters
not
though
a
youth
be
slow
if
he
be
but
diligent
quickness
of
parts
may
even
prove
a
defect
inasmuch
as
the
boy
who
learns
readily
will
often
forget
as
readily
and
also
because
he
finds
no
need
of
cultivating
that
quality
of
application
and
perseverance
which
the
slower
youth
is
compelled
to
exercise
and
which
proves
so
valuable
an
element
in
the
formation
of
every
character
davy
said
what
i
am
i
have
made
myself
and
the
same
holds
true
universally
to
conclude
the
best
culture
is
not
obtained
from
teachers
when
at
school
or
college
so
much
as
by
our
own
diligent
when
we
have
become
men
hence
parents
need
not
be
in
too
great
haste
to
see
their
children
s
talents
forced
into
bloom
let
them
watch
and
wait
patiently
letting
good
example
and
quiet
training
do
their
work
and
leave
the
rest
to
providence
let
them
see
to
it
that
the
youth
is
provided
by
free
exercise
of
his
bodily
powers
with
a
full
stock
of
physical
health
set
him
fairly
on
the
road
of
carefully
train
his
habits
of
application
and
perseverance
and
as
he
grows
older
if
the
right
stuff
be
in
him
he
will
be
enabled
vigorously
and
effectively
to
cultivate
himself

good

its
weight
but
without
the
accompaniment
of

it
is
of
comparatively
small
influence
and
it
will
be
found
that
the
common
saying
of
do
as
i
say
not
as
i
do
is
usually
reversed
in
the
actual
experience
of
life
all
persons
are
more
or
less
apt
to
learn
through
the
eye
rather
than
the
ear
and
whatever
is
seen
in
fact
makes
a
far
deeper
impression
than
anything
that
is
merely
read
or
heard
this
is
especially
the
case
in
early
youth
when
the
eye
is
the
chief
inlet
of
knowledge
whatever
children
see
they
unconsciously
imitate
they
insensibly
come
to

hence
the
vast
importance
of
domestic
training
for
whatever
may
be
the
efficiency
of
schools
the
examples
set
in
our
homes
must
always
be
of

greater
influence

of
our

it

buxton
when
occupying
an
eminent
and
influential
station
in
life
wrote
to
his

constantly
feel
especially
in
action
and
exertion
for
others
the
effects
of
principles
early
implanted
by
you
in
my
buxton
was
also
accustomed
to
remember
with
gratitude
the
obligations
which
he
owed
to
an
illiterate
man
a
gamekeeper
named
abraham
plastow
with
whom
he
played
and
rode
and
man
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
was
full
of
natural
good
sense
and
what
made
him
particularly
valuable
says
buxton
were
his
principles
of
integrity
and
honour
he
never
said
or
did
a
thing
in
the
absence
of
my
mother
of
which
she
would
have
disapproved
he
always
held
up
the
highest
standard
of
integrity
and
filled
our
youthful
minds
with
sentiments
as
pure
and
as
generous
as
could
be
found
in
the
writings
of
seneca
or
cicero
such
was
my
first
instructor
and
i
must
add
my

back
upon
the
admirable
example
set
him
by

the
personal
influence
exercised
by
her
mother
upon
the
society
amidst
which
she
moved
when
she
entered
a
room
it
had
the
effect
of
immediately
raising
the
tone
of
the
conversation

to
breathe
more
freely
and
stand
more
erectly
in

became
for

transformed
into
another
so
much
does
she
moral
health
depend
upon
the
moral
atmosphere
that
is
breathed
and
so
great
is
the
influence
daily
exercised
by
parents
over
their
children
by
living
a
life
before
their
eyes
that
perhaps
the
best
system
of
parental
instruction
might
be
summed
up
in
these
two
words
improve
there
is
something
solemn
and
awful
in
the
thought
that
there
is
not
an
act
done
or
a
word
uttered
by
a
human
being
but
carries
with
it
a
train
of
consequences
the
end
of
which
we
may
never
trace
not
one
but
to
a
certain
extent
gives
a
colour
to
our
life
and
insensibly
influences
the
lives
of
those
about
us
the
good
deed
or
word
will
live
even
though
we
may
not
see
it
fructify
but
so
will
the
bad
and
no
person
is
so
insignificant
as
to
be
sure
that
his
example
will
not
do
good
on
the
one
hand
or
evil
on
the
other
the
spirits
of
men
do
not
die
they
still
live
and
walk
abroad
among
us
it
was
a
fine
and
a
true
thought
uttered
by
disraeli
in
the
house
of
commons
on
the
death
of
richard
cobden
that
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
though
not
present
were
still
members
of
that
house
who
were
independent
of
dissolutions
of
the
caprices
of
constituencies
and
even
of
the
course
of
there
is
indeed
an
essence
of
immortality
in
the
life
of
man
even
in
this
world
no
individual
in
the
universe
stands
alone
he
is
a
component
part
of
a
system
of
mutual
dependencies
and
by
his
several
acts
he
either
increases
or
diminishes
the
sum
of
human
good
now
and
for
ever
as
the
present
is
rooted
in
the
past
and
the
lives
and
examples
of
our
forefathers
still
to
a
great
extent
influence
us
so
are
we
by
our
daily
acts
contributing
to
form
the
condition
and
character
of
the
future
man
is
a
fruit
formed
and
ripened
by
the
culture
of
all
the
foregoing
centuries
and
the
living
generation
continues
the
magnetic
current
of
action
and
example
destined
to
bind
the
remotest
past
with
the
most
distant
future
no
man
s
acts
die
utterly
and
though
his
body
may
resolve
into
dust
and
air
his
good
or
his
bad
deeds
will
still
be
bringing
forth
fruit
after
their
kind
and
influencing
future
generations
for
all
time
to
come
it
is
in
this
momentous
and
solemn
fact
that
the
great
peril
and
responsibility
of
human
existence
lies
babbage
has
so
powerfully
expressed
this
idea
in
a
noble
passage
in
one
of
his
writings
that
we
here
venture
to
quote
his
words
every
atom
he
says
impressed
with
good
or
ill
retains
at
once
the
motions
which
philosophers
and
sages
have
imparted
to
it
mixed
and
combined
in
ten
thousand
ways
with
all
that
is
worthless
and
base
the
air
itself
is
one
vast
library
on
whose
pages
are
written
all
that
man
has
ever
said
or
whispered
there
in
their
immutable
but
unerring
characters
mixed
with
the
earliest
as
well
as
the
latest
sighs
of
mortality
stand
for
ever
recorded
vows
unredeemed
promises
unfulfilled
perpetuating
in
the
united
movements
of
each
particle
the
testimony
of
man
s
changeful
will
but
if
the
air
we
breathe
is
the
historian
of
the
sentiments
we
have
uttered
earth
air
and
ocean
are
in
like
manner
the
eternal
witnesses
of
the
acts
we
have
done
the
same
principle
of
the
equality
of
action
and
reaction
applies
to
them
no
motion
impressed
by
natural
causes
or
by
human
agency
is
ever
obliterated
if
the
almighty
stamped
on
the
brow
of
the
first
murderer
the
indelible
and
visible
mark
of
his
guilt
he
has
also
established
laws
by
which
every
succeeding
criminal
is
not
less
irrevocably
chained
to
the
testimony
of
his
crime
for
every
atom
of
his
mortal
frame
through
whatever
changes
its
severed
particles
may
migrate
will
still
retain
adhering
to
it
through
every
combination
some
movement
derived
from
that
very
muscular
effort
by
which
the
crime
itself
was
thus
every
act
we
do
or
word
we
utter
as
well
as
every
act
we
witness
or
word
we
hear
carries
with
it
an
influence
which
extends
over
and
gives
a
colour
not
only
to
the
whole
of
our
future
life
but
makes
itself
felt
upon
the
whole
frame
of
society
we
may
not
and
indeed
can
not
possibly
trace
the
influence
working
itself
into
action
in
its
various
ramifications
amongst
our
children
our
friends
or
associates
yet
there
it
is
assuredly
working
on
for
ever
and
herein
lies
the
great
significance
of
setting
forth
a
good
example
silent
teaching
which
even
the
poorest
and
least
significant
person
can
practise
in
his
daily
life
there
is
no
one
so
humble
but
that
he
owes
to
others
this
simple
but
priceless
instruction
even
the
meanest
condition
may
thus
be
made
useful
for
the
light
set
in
a
low
place
shines
as
faithfully
as
that
set
upon
a
hill
everywhere
and
under
almost
all
circumstances
however
externally
moorland
shielings
in
cottage
hamlets
in
the
close
alleys
of
great
true
man
may
grow
he
who
tills
a
space
of
earth
scarce
bigger
than
is
needed
for
his
grave
may
work
as
faithfully
and
to
as
good
purpose
as
the
heir
to
thousands
the
commonest
workshop
may
thus
be
a
school
of
industry
science
and
good
morals
on
the
one
hand
or
of
idleness
folly
and
depravity
on
the
other
it
all
depends
on
the
individual
men
and
the
use
they
make
of
the
opportunities
for
good
which
offer
themselves
a
life
well
spent
a
character
uprightly
sustained
is
no
slight
legacy
to
leave
to
one
s
children
and
to
the
world
for
it
is
the
most
eloquent
lesson
of
virtue
and
the
severest
reproof
of
vice
while
it
continues
an
enduring
source
of
the
best
kind
of
riches
well
for
those
who
can
say
as
pope
did
in
rejoinder
to
the
sarcasm
of
lord
hervey
i
think
it
enough
that
my
parents
such
as
they
were
never
cost
me
a
blush
and
that
their
son
such
as
he
is
never
cost
them
a
it
is
not
enough
to
tell
others
what
they
are
to
do
but
to
exhibit
the
actual
example
of
doing
what
chisholm
described
to
stowe
as
the
secret
of
her
success
applies
to
all
life
i
found
she
said
that
if
we
want
anything
we
must
go
to
work
and
it
is
of
no
use
merely
to
it
is
poor
eloquence
that
only
shows
how
a
person
can
talk
had
chisholm
rested
satisfied
with
lecturing
her
project
she
was
persuaded
would
never
have
got
beyond
the
region
of
talk
but
when
people
saw
what
she
was
doing
and
had
actually
accomplished
they
fell
in
with
her
views
and
came
forward
to
help
her
hence
the
most
beneficent
worker
is
not
he
who
says
the
most
eloquent
things
or
even
who
thinks
the
most
loftily
but
he
who
does
the
most
eloquent
acts
persons
even
in
the
humblest
station
in
life
who
are
energetic
doers
may
thus
give
an
impulse
to
good
works
out
of
all
proportion
apparently
to
their
actual
station
in
society
thomas
wright
might
have
talked
about
the
reclamation
of
criminals
and
john
pounds
about
the
necessity
for
ragged
schools
and
yet
done
nothing
instead
of
which
they
simply
set
to
work
without
any
other
idea
in
their
minds
than
that
of
doing
not
talking
and
how
the
example
of
even
the
poorest
man
may
tell
upon
society
hear
what
guthrie
the
apostle
of
the
ragged
school
movement
says
of
the
influence
which
the
example
of
john
pounds
the
humble
portsmouth
cobbler
exercised
upon
his
own
working
career
the
interest
i
have
been
led
to
take
in
this
cause
is
an
example
of
how
in
providence
a
man
s
course
of
life
like
that
of
a
be
determined
and
affected
by
very
trivial
circumstances
it
is
rather
least
it
is
interesting
to
me
to
it
was
by
a
picture
i
was
first
led
to
take
an
interest
in
ragged
a
picture
in
an
old
obscure
decaying
burgh
that
stands
on
the
shores
of
the
frith
of
forth
the
birthplace
of
thomas
chalmers
i
went
to
see
this
place
many
years
ago
and
going
into
an
inn
for
refreshment
i
found
the
room
covered
with
pictures
of
shepherdesses
with
their
crooks
and
sailors
in
holiday
attire
not
particularly
interesting
but
above
the
there
was
a
large
print
more
respectable
than
its
neighbours
which
represented
a
cobbler
s
room
the
cobbler
was
there
himself
spectacles
on
nose
an
old
shoe
between
his
massive
forehead
and
firm
mouth
indicating
great
determination
of
character
and
beneath
his
bushy
eyebrows
benevolence
gleamed
out
on
a
number
of
poor
ragged
boys
and
girls
who
stood
at
their
lessons
round
the
busy
cobbler
my
curiosity
was
awakened
and
in
the
inscription
i
read
how
this
man
john
pounds
a
cobbler
in
portsmouth
taking
pity
on
the
multitude
of
poor
ragged
children
left
by
ministers
and
magistrates
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
go
to
ruin
on
the
like
a
good
shepherd
he
gathered
in
these
wretched
he
had
trained
them
to
god
and
to
the
how
while
earning
his
daily
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
he
had
rescued
from
misery
and
saved
to
society
not
less
than
five
hundred
of
these
children
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
i
felt
reproved
for
the
little
i
had
done
my
feelings
were
touched
i
was
astonished
at
this
man
s
achievements
and
i
well
remember
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
saying
to
my
companion
and
i
have
seen
in
my
cooler
and
calmer
moments
no
reason
for
unsaying
the
saying
that
man
is
an
honour
to
humanity
and
deserves
the
tallest
monument
ever
raised
within
the
shores
of
i
took
up
that
man
s
history
and
i
found
it
animated
by
the
spirit
of
him
who
had
compassion
on
the
john
pounds
was
a
clever
man
besides
and
like
paul
if
he
could
not
win
a
poor
boy
any
other
way
he
won
him
by
art
he
would
be
seen
chasing
a
ragged
boy
along
the
quays
and
compelling
him
to
come
to
school
not
by
the
power
of
a
policeman
but
by
the
power
of
a
hot
potato
he
knew
the
love
an
irishman
had
for
a
potato
and
john
pounds
might
be
seen
running
holding
under
the
boy
s
nose
a
potato
like
an
irishman
very
hot
and
with
a
coat
as
ragged
as
himself
when
the
day
comes
when
honour
will
be
done
to
whom
honour
is
due
i
can
fancy
the
crowd
of
those
whose
fame
poets
have
sung
and
to
whose
memory
monuments
have
been
raised
dividing
like
the
wave
and
passing
the
great
and
the
noble
and
the
mighty
of
the
land
this
poor
obscure
old
man
stepping
forward
and
receiving
the
especial
notice
of
him
who
said
inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
did
it
also
to
the
education
of
character
is
very
much
a
question
of
models
we
mould
ourselves
so
unconsciously
after
the
characters
manners
habits
and
opinions
of
those
who
are
about
us
good
rules
may
do
much
but
good
models
far
more
for
in
the
latter
we
have
instruction
in
at
work
good
admonition
and
bad
example
only
build
with
one
hand
to
pull
down
with
the
other
hence
the
vast
importance
of
exercising
great
care
in
the
selection
of
companions
especially
in
youth
there
is
a
magnetic
affinity
in
young
persons
which
insensibly
tends
to
assimilate
them
to
each
other
s
likeness
edgeworth
was
so
strongly
convinced
that
from
sympathy
they
involuntarily
imitated
or
caught
the
tone
of
the
company
they
frequented
that
he
held
it
to
be
of
the
most
essential
importance
that
they
should
be
taught
to
select
the
very
best
models
no
company
or
good
company
was
his
motto
lord
collingwood
writing
to
a
young
friend
said
hold
it
as
a
maxim
that
you
had
better
be
alone
than
in
mean
company
let
your
companions
be
such
as
yourself
or
superior
for
the
worth
of
a
man
will
always
be
ruled
by
that
of
his
it
was
a
remark
of
the
famous
sydenham
that
everybody
some
time
or
other
would
be
the
better
or
the
worse
for
having
but
spoken
to
a
good
or
a
bad
man
as
sir
peter
lely
made
it
a
rule
never
to
look
at
a
bad
picture
if
he
could
help
it
believing
that
whenever
he
did
so
his
pencil
caught
a
taint
from
it
so
whoever
chooses
to
gaze
often
upon
a
debased
specimen
of
humanity
and
to
frequent
his
society
can
not
help
gradually
assimilating
himself
to
that
sort
of
model
it
is
therefore
advisable
for
young
men
to
seek
the
fellowship
of
the
good
and
always
to
aim
at
a
higher
standard
than
themselves
francis
horner
speaking
of
the
advantages
to
himself
of
direct
personal
intercourse
with
intelligent
men
said
i
can
not
hesitate
to
decide
that
i
have
derived
more
intellectual
improvement
from
them
than
from
all
the
books
i
have
turned
lord
shelburne
afterwards
marquis
of
lansdowne
when
a
young
man
paid
a
visit
to
the
venerable
malesherbes
and
was
so
much
impressed
by
it
that
he
said
i
have
travelled
much
but
i
have
never
been
so
influenced
by
personal
contact
with
any
man
and
if
i
ever
accomplish
any
good
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
am
certain
that
the
recollection
of
de
malesherbes
will
animate
my
so
fowell
buxton
was
always
ready
to
acknowledge
the
powerful
influence
exercised
upon
the
formation
of
his
character
in
early
life
by
the
example
of
the
gurney
family
it
has
given
a
colour
to
my
life
he
used
to
say
speaking
of
his
success
at
the
dublin
university
he
confessed
i
can
ascribe
it
to
nothing
but
my
earlham
it
was
from
the
gurneys
he
caught
the
infection
of
contact
with
the
good
never
fails
to
impart
good
and
we
carry
away
with
us
some
of
the
blessing
as
travellers
garments
retain
the
odour
of
the
flowers
and
shrubs
through
which
they
have
passed
those
who
knew
the
late
john
sterling
intimately
have
spoken
of
the
beneficial
influence
which
he
exercised
on
all
with
whom
he
came
into
personal
contact
many
owed
to
him
their
first
awakening
to
a
higher
being
from
him
they
learnt
what
they
were
and
what
they
ought
to
be
trench
says
of
him
it
was
impossible
to
come
in
contact
with
his
noble
nature
without
feeling
one
s
self
in
some
measure
and
as
i
ever
felt
when
i
left
him
into
a
higher
region
of
objects
and
aims
than
that
in
which
one
is
tempted
habitually
to
it
is
thus
that
the
noble
character
always
acts
we
become
insensibly
elevated
by
him
and
can
not
help
feeling
as
he
does
and
acquiring
the
habit
of
looking
at
things
in
the
same
light
such
is
the
magical
action
and
reaction
of
minds
upon
each
other
artists
also
feel
themselves
elevated
by
contact
with
artists
greater
than
themselves
thus
haydn
s
genius
was
first
fired
by
handel
hearing
him
play
haydn
s
ardour
for
musical
composition
was
at
once
excited
and
but
for
this
circumstance
he
himself
believed
that
he
would
never
have
written
the
speaking
of
handel
he
said
when
he
chooses
he
strikes
like
the
thunderbolt
and
at
another
time
there
is
not
a
note
of
him
but
draws
scarlatti
was
another
of
handel
s
ardent
admirers
following
him
all
over
italy
afterwards
when
speaking
of
the
great
master
he
would
cross
himself
in
token
of
admiration
true
artists
never
fail
generously
to
recognise
each
other
s
greatness
thus
beethoven
s
admiration
for
cherubini
was
regal
and
he
ardently
hailed
the
genius
of
schubert
truly
said
he
in
schubert
dwells
a
divine
when
northcote
was
a
mere
youth
he
had
such
an
admiration
for
reynolds
that
when
the
great
painter
was
once
attending
a
public
meeting
down
in
devonshire
the
boy
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
got
so
near
reynolds
as
to
touch
the
skirt
of
his
coat
which
i
did
says
northcote
with
great
satisfaction
to
my
mind
true
touch
of
youthful
enthusiasm
in
its
admiration
of
genius
the
example
of
the
brave
is
an
inspiration
to
the
timid
their
presence
thrilling
through
every
fibre
hence
the
miracles
of
valour
so
often
performed
by
ordinary
men
under
the
leadership
of
the
heroic
the
very
recollection
of
the
deeds
of
the
valiant
stirs
men
s
blood
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
ziska
bequeathed
his
skin
to
be
used
as
a
drum
to
inspire
the
valour
of
the
bohemians
when
scanderbeg
prince
of
epirus
was
dead
the
turks
wished
to
possess
his
bones
that
each
might
wear
a
piece
next
his
heart
hoping
thus
to
secure
some
portion
of
the
courage
he
had
displayed
while
living
and
which
they
had
so
often
experienced
in
battle
when
the
gallant
douglas
bearing
the
heart
of
bruce
to
the
holy
land
saw
one
of
his
knights
surrounded
and
sorely
pressed
by
the
saracens
he
took
from
his
neck
the
silver
case
containing
the
hero
s
bequest
and
throwing
it
amidst
the
thickest
press
of
his
foes
cried
pass
first
in
fight
as
thou
wert
wont
to
do
and
douglas
will
follow
thee
or
die
and
so
saying
he
rushed
forward
to
the
place
where
it
fell
and
was
there
slain
the
chief
use
of
biography
consists
in
the
noble
models
of
character
in
which
it
abounds
our
great
forefathers
still
live
among
us
in
the
records
of
their
lives
as
well
as
in
the
acts
they
have
done
which
live
also
still
sit
by
us
at
table
and
hold
us
by
the
hand
furnishing
examples
for
our
benefit
which
we
may
still
study
admire
and
imitate
indeed
whoever
has
left
behind
him
the
record
of
a
noble
life
has
bequeathed
to
posterity
an
enduring
source
of
good
for
it
serves
as
a
model
for
others
to
form
themselves
by
in
all
time
to
come
still
breathing
fresh
life
into
men
helping
them
to
reproduce
his
life
anew
and
to
illustrate
his
character
in
other
forms
hence
a
book
containing
the
life
of
a
true
man
is
full
of
precious
seed
it
is
a
still
living
voice
it
is
an
intellect
to
use
milton
s
words
it
is
the
precious
of
a
master
spirit
embalmed
and
treasured
up
on
purpose
to
a
life
beyond
such
a
book
never
ceases
to
exercise
an
elevating
and
ennobling
influence
but
above
all
there
is
the
book
containing
the
very
highest
example
set
before
us
to
shape
our
lives
by
in
this
most
suitable
for
all
the
necessities
of
our
mind
and
example
which
we
can
only
follow
afar
off
and
feel
after
like
plants
or
vines
which
never
saw
the
sun
but
dream
of
him
and
guess
where
he
may
be
and
do
their
best
to
climb
and
get
to
again
no
young
man
can
rise
from
the
perusal
of
such
lives
as
those
of
buxton
and
arnold
without
feeling
his
mind
and
heart
made
better
and
his
best
resolves
invigorated
such
biographies
increase
a
man
s
by
demonstrating
what
men
can
be
and
what
they
can
do
fortifying
his
hopes
and
elevating
his
aims
in
life
sometimes
a
young
man
discovers
himself
in
a
biography
as
correggio
felt
within
him
the
risings
of
genius
on
contemplating
the
works
of
michael
angelo
and
i
too
am
a
painter
he
exclaimed
sir
samuel
romilly
in
his
autobiography
confessed
himself
to
have
been
powerfully
influenced
by
the
life
of
the
great
and
french
chancellor
daguesseau
the
works
of
thomas
says
he
had
fallen
into
my
hands
and
i
had
read
with
admiration
his
eloge
of
daguesseau
and
the
career
of
honour
which
he
represented
that
illustrious
magistrate
to
have
run
excited
to
a
great
degree
my
ardour
and
ambition
and
opened
to
my
imagination
new
paths
of
franklin
was
accustomed
to
attribute
his
usefulness
and
eminence
to
his
having
early
read
cotton
mather
s
essays
to
do
good
book
which
grew
out
of
mather
s
own
life
and
see
how
good
example
draws
other
men
after
it
and
propagates
itself
through
future
generations
in
all
lands
for
samuel
drew
avers
that
he
framed
his
own
life
and
especially
his
business
habits
after
the
model
left
on
record
by
benjamin
franklin
thus
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
a
good
example
may
not
reach
or
where
it
will
end
if
indeed
it
have
an
end
hence
the
advantage
in
literature
as
in
life
of
keeping
the
best
society
reading
the
best
books
and
wisely
admiring
and
imitating
the
best
things
we
find
in
them
in
literature
said
lord
dudley
i
am
fond
of
confining
myself
to
the
best
company
which
consists
chiefly
of
my
old
acquaintance
with
whom
i
am
desirous
of
becoming
more
intimate
and
i
suspect
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
is
more
profitable
if
not
more
agreeable
to
read
an
old
book
over
again
than
to
read
a
new
one
for
the
first
sometimes
a
book
containing
a
noble
exemplar
of
life
taken
up
at
random
merely
with
the
object
of
reading
it
as
a
pastime
has
been
known
to
call
forth
energies
whose
existence
had
not
before
been
suspected
alfieri
was
first
drawn
with
passion
to
literature
by
reading
plutarch
s
loyola
when
a
soldier
serving
at
the
siege
of
pampeluna
and
laid
up
by
a
dangerous
wound
in
his
leg
asked
for
a
book
to
divert
his
thoughts
the
lives
of
the
saints
was
brought
to
him
and
its
perusal
so
inflamed
his
mind
that
he
determined
thenceforth
to
devote
himself
to
the
founding
of
a
religious
order
luther
in
like
manner
was
inspired
to
undertake
the
great
labours
of
his
life
by
a
perusal
of
the
life
and
writings
of
john
wolff
was
stimulated
to
enter
upon
his
missionary
career
by
reading
the
life
of
francis
xavier
and
the
book
fired
his
youthful
bosom
with
a
passion
the
most
sincere
and
ardent
to
devote
himself
to
the
enterprise
of
his
life
william
carey
also
got
the
first
idea
of
entering
upon
his
sublime
labours
as
a
missionary
from
a
perusal
of
the
voyages
of
captain
cook
francis
horner
was
accustomed
to
note
in
his
diary
and
letters
the
books
by
which
he
was
most
improved
and
influenced
amongst
these
were
condorcet
s
eloge
of
haller
sir
joshua
reynolds
discourses
the
writings
of
bacon
and
burnet
s
account
of
sir
matthew
the
perusal
of
the
portrait
of
a
prodigy
of
says
filled
him
with
enthusiasm
of
condorcet
s
eloge
of
haller
he
said
i
never
rise
from
the
account
of
such
men
without
a
sort
of
thrilling
palpitation
about
me
which
i
know
not
whether
i
should
call
admiration
ambition
or
and
speaking
of
the
discourses
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
he
said
next
to
the
writings
of
bacon
there
is
no
book
which
has
more
powerfully
impelled
me
to
he
is
one
of
the
first
men
of
genius
who
has
condescended
to
inform
the
world
of
the
steps
by
which
greatness
is
attained
the
confidence
with
which
he
asserts
the
omnipotence
of
human
labour
has
the
effect
of
familiarising
his
reader
with
the
idea
that
genius
is
an
acquisition
rather
than
a
gift
whilst
with
all
there
is
blended
so
naturally
and
eloquently
the
most
elevated
and
passionate
admiration
of
excellence
that
upon
the
whole
there
is
no
book
of
a
more
it
is
remarkable
that
reynolds
himself
attributed
his
first
passionate
impulse
towards
the
study
of
art
to
reading
richardson
s
account
of
a
great
painter
and
haydon
was
in
like
manner
afterwards
inflamed
to
follow
the
same
pursuit
by
reading
of
the
career
of
reynolds
thus
the
brave
and
aspiring
life
of
one
man
lights
a
flame
in
the
minds
of
others
of
like
faculties
and
impulse
and
where
there
is
equally
vigorous
efforts
like
distinction
and
success
will
almost
surely
follow
thus
the
chain
of
example
is
carried
down
through
time
in
an
endless
succession
of
links
exciting
imitation
and
perpetuating
the
true
aristocracy
of
genius
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
one
of
the
most
infectious
examples
which
can
be
set
before
the
young
is
that
of
cheerful
working
cheerfulness
gives
elasticity
to
the
spirit
spectres
fly
before
it
difficulties
cause
no
despair
for
they
are
encountered
with
hope
and
the
mind
acquires
that
happy
disposition
to
improve
opportunities
which
rarely
fails
of
success
the
fervent
spirit
is
always
a
healthy
and
happy
spirit
working
cheerfully
itself
and
stimulating
others
to
work
it
confers
a
dignity
on
even
the
most
ordinary
occupations
the
most
effective
work
also
is
usually
the
which
passes
through
the
hands
or
the
head
of
him
whose
heart
is
glad
hume
was
accustomed
to
say
that
he
would
rather
possess
a
cheerful
always
to
look
at

side

in
another
sphere
of

arnold
was
a
noble
and
a
cheerful
worker
throwing
himself
into
the
great
business
of
his
life
the
training
and
teaching
of
young
men
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
it
is
stated
in
his
admirable
biography
that
the
most
remarkable
thing
in
the
laleham
circle
was
the
wonderful
healthiness
of
tone
which
prevailed
there
it
was
a
place
where
a
new
comer
at
once
felt
that
a
great
and
earnest
work
was
going
forward
every
pupil
was
made
to
feel
that
there
was
a
work
for
him
to
do
that
his
happiness
as
well
as
his
duty
lay
in
doing
that
work
well
hence
an
indescribable
zest
was
communicated
to
a
young
man
s
feeling
about
life
a
strange
joy
came
over
him
on
discerning
that
he
had
the
means
of
being
useful
and
thus
of
being
happy
and
a
deep
respect
and
ardent
attachment
sprang
up
towards
him
who
had
taught
him
thus
to
value
life
and
his
own
self
and
his
work
and
mission
in
the
world
all
this
was
founded
on
the
breadth
and
comprehensiveness
of
arnold
s
character
as
well
as
its
striking
truth
and
reality
on
the
unfeigned
regard
he
had
for
work
of
all
kinds
and
the
sense
he
had
of
its
value
both
for
the
complex
aggregate
of
society
and
the
growth
and
protection
of
the
individual
in
all
this
there
was
no
excitement
no
predilection
for
one
class
of
work
above
another
no
enthusiasm
for
any
object
but
a
humble
profound
and
most
religious
consciousness
that
work
is
the
appointed
calling
of
man
on
earth
the
end
for
which
his
various
faculties
were
given
the
element
in
which
his
nature
is
ordained
to
develop
itself
and
in
which
his
progressive
advance
towards
heaven
is
to
among
the
many
valuable
men
trained
for
public
life
and
usefulness
by
arnold
was
the
gallant
hodson
of
hodson
s
horse
who
writing
home
from
india
many
years
after
thus
spoke
of
his
revered
master
the
influence
he
produced
has
been
most
lasting
and
striking
in
its
effects
it
is
felt
even
in
india
i
can
not
say
more
than
the
useful
influence
which
a
man
of
energy
and
industry
may
exercise
amongst
his
neighbours
and
dependants
and
accomplish
for
his
country
can
not
perhaps
be
better
illustrated
than
by
the
career
of
sir
john
sinclair
characterized
by
the
abbé
gregoire
as
the
most
indefatigable
man
in
he
was
originally
a
country
laird
born
to
a
considerable
estate
situated
near
john
o
groat
s
house
almost
beyond
the
beat
of
civilization
in
a
bare
wild
country
fronting
the
stormy
north
sea
his
father
dying
while
he
was
a
youth
of
sixteen
the
management
of
the
family
property
thus
early
devolved
upon
him
and
at
eighteen
he
began
a
course
of
vigorous
improvement
in
the
county
of
caithness
which
eventually
spread
all
over
scotland
agriculture
then
was
in
a
most
backward
state
the
fields
were
unenclosed
the
lands
undrained
the
small
farmers
of
caithness
were
so
poor
that
they
could
scarcely
afford
to
keep
a
horse
or
shelty
the
hard
work
was
chiefly
done
and
the
burdens
borne
by
the
women
and
if
a
cottier
lost
a
horse
it
was
not
unusual
for
him
to
marry
a
wife
as
the
cheapest
substitute
the
country
was
without
roads
or
bridges
and
drovers
driving
their
cattle
south
had
to
swim
the
rivers
along
with
their
beasts
the
chief
track
leading
into
caithness
lay
along
a
high
shelf
on
a
mountain
side
the
road
being
some
hundred
feet
of
clear
perpendicular
height
above
the
sea
which
dashed
below
sir
john
though
a
mere
youth
determined
to
make
a
new
road
over
the
hill
of
ben
cheilt
the
old
proprietors
however
regarding
his
scheme
with
incredulity
and
derision
but
he
himself
laid
out
the
road
assembled
some
twelve
hundred
workmen
early
one
summer
s
morning
set
them
simultaneously
to
work
superintending
their
labours
and
stimulating
them
by
his
presence
and
example
and
before
night
what
had
been
a
dangerous
sheep
track
six
miles
in
length
hardly
passable
for
led
horses
was
made
practicable
for
as
if
by
the
power
of
magic
it
was
an
admirable
example
of
energy
and
labour
which
could
not
fail
to
have
a
most
salutary
influence
upon
the
surrounding
population
he
then
proceeded
to
make
more
roads
to
erect
mills
to
build
bridges
and
to
enclose
and
cultivate
the
waste
lands
he
introduced
improved
methods
of
culture
and
regular
rotation
of
crops
distributing
small
premiums
to
encourage
industry
and
he
thus
soon
quickened
the
whole
frame
of
society
within
reach
of
his
influence
and
infused
an
entirely
new
spirit
into
the
cultivators
of
the
soil
from
being
one
of
the
most
inaccessible
districts
of
the
very
of
became
a
pattern
county
for
its
roads
its
agriculture
and
its
fisheries
in
sinclair
s
youth
the
post
was
carried
by
a
runner
only
once
a
week
and
the
young
baronet
then
declared
that
he
would
never
rest
till
a
coach
drove
daily
to
thurso
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
could
not
believe
in
any
such
thing
and
it
became
a
proverb
in
the
county
to
say
of
an
utterly
impossible
scheme
ou
ay
that
will
come
to
pass
when
sir
john
sees
the
daily
mail
at
thurso
but
sir
john
lived
to
see
his
dream
realized
and
the
daily
mail
established
to
thurso
the
circle
of
his
benevolent
operation
gradually
widened
observing
the
serious
deterioration
which
had
taken
place
in
the
quality
of
british
wool
of
the
staple
commodities
of
the
country
forthwith
though
but
a
private
and
country
gentleman
devoted
himself
to
its
improvement
by
his
personal
exertions
he
established
the
british
wool
society
for
the
purpose
and
himself
led
the
way
to
practical
improvement
by
importing
sheep
from
all
countries
at
his
own
expense
the
result
was
the
introduction
into
scotland
of
the
celebrated
cheviot
breed
sheep
farmers
scouted
the
idea
of
south
country
flocks
being
able
to
thrive
in
the
far
north
but
sir
john
persevered
and
in
a
few
years
there
were
not
fewer
than
cheviots
diffused
over
the
four
northern
counties
alone
the
value
of
all
grazing
land
was
thus
enormously
increased
and
scotch
estates
which
before
were
comparatively
worthless
began
to
yield
large
rentals
returned
by
caithness
to
parliament
in
which
he
remained
for
thirty
years
rarely
missing
a
division
his
position
gave
him
farther
opportunities
of
usefulness
which
he
did
not
neglect
to
employ
pitt
observing
his
persevering
energy
in
all
useful
public
projects
sent
for
him
to
downing
street
and
voluntarily
proposed
his
assistance
in
any
object
he
might
have
in
view
another
man
might
have
thought
of
himself
and
his
own
promotion
but
sir
john
characteristically
replied
that
he
desired
no
favour
for
himself
but
intimated
that
the
reward
most
gratifying
to
his
feelings
would
be
pitt
s
assistance
in
the
establishment
of
a
national
board
of
agriculture
arthur
young
laid
a
bet
with
the
baronet
that
his
scheme
would
never
be
established
adding
your
board
of
agriculture
will
be
in
the
moon
but
vigorously
setting
to
work
he
roused
public
attention
to
the
subject
enlisted
a
majority
of
parliament
on
his
side
and
eventually
established
the
board
of
which
he
was
appointed
president
the
result
of
its
action
need
not
be
described
but
the
stimulus
which
it
gave
to
agriculture
and
was
shortly
felt
throughout
the
whole
united
kingdom
and
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
were
redeemed
from
barrenness
by
its
operation
he
was
equally
indefatigable
in
encouraging
the
establishment
of
fisheries
and
the
successful
founding
of
these
great
branches
of
british
industry
at
thurso
and
wick
was
mainly
due
to
his
exertions
he
urged
for
long
years
and
at
length
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
enclosure
of
a
harbour
for
the
latter
place
which
is
perhaps
the
greatest
and
most
prosperous
fishing
town
in
the
world
sir
john
threw
his
personal
energy
into
every
work
in
which
he
engaged
rousing
the
inert
stimulating
the
idle
encouraging
the
hopeful
and
working
with
all
when
a
french
invasion
was
threatened
he
offered
to
pitt
to
raise
a
regiment
on
his
own
estate
and
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
went
down
to
the
north
and
raised
a
battalion
of
men
afterwards
increased
to
and
it
was
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
finest
volunteer
regiments
ever
raised
inspired
throughout
by
his
own
noble
and
patriotic
spirit
while
commanding
officer
of
the
camp
at
aberdeen
he
held
the
offices
of
a
director
of
the
bank
of
scotland
chairman
of
the
british
wool
society
provost
of
wick
director
of
the
british
fishery
society
commissioner
for
issuing
exchequer
bills
member
of
parliament
for
caithness
and
president
of
the
board
of
agriculture
amidst
all
this
multifarious
and
work
he
even
found
time
to
write
books
enough
of
themselves
to
establish
a
reputation
when
mr
rush
the
american
ambassador
arrived
in
england
he
relates
that
he
inquired
of
coke
of
holkham
what
was
the
best
work
on
agriculture
and
was
referred
to
sir
john
sinclair
s
and
when
he
further
asked
of
vansittart
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
what
was
the
best
work
on
british
finance
he
was
again
referred
to
a
work
by
sir
john
sinclair
his
history
of
the
public
but
the
great
monument
of
his
indefatigable
industry
a
work
that
would
have
appalled
other
men
but
only
served
to
rouse
and
sustain
his
energy
was
his
statistical
account
of
scotland
in
volumes
one
of
the
most
valuable
practical
works
ever
published
in
any
age
or
country
amid
a
host
of
other
pursuits
it
occupied
him
nearly
eight
years
of
hard
labour
during
which
he
received
and
attended
to
upwards
of
letters
on
the
subject
it
was
a
thoroughly
patriotic
undertaking
from
which
he
derived
no
personal
advantage
whatever
beyond
the
honour
of
having
completed
it
the
whole
of
the
profits
were
assigned
by
him
to
the
society
for
the
sons
of
the
clergy
in
scotland
the
publication
of
the
book
led
to
great
public
improvements
it
was
followed
by
the
immediate
abolition
of
several
oppressive
feudal
rights
to
which
it
called
attention
the
salaries
of
schoolmasters
and
clergymen
in
many
parishes
were
increased
and
an
increased
stimulus
was
given
to
agriculture
throughout
scotland
sir
john
then
publicly
offered
to
undertake
the
much
greater
labour
of
collecting
and
publishing
a
similar
statistical
account
of
england
but
unhappily
the
then
archbishop
of
canterbury
refused
to
sanction
it
lest
it
should
interfere
with
the
tithes
of
the
clergy
and
the
idea
was
abandoned
a
remarkable
illustration
of
his
energetic
promptitude
was
the
manner
in
which
he
once
provided
on
a
great
emergency
for
the
relief
of
the
manufacturing
districts
in
the
stagnation
produced
by
the
war
led
to
an
unusual
number
of
bankruptcies
and
many
of
the
first
houses
in
manchester
and
glasgow
were
tottering
not
so
much
from
want
of
property
but
because
the
usual
sources
of
trade
and
credit
were
for
the
time
closed
up
a
period
of
intense
distress
amongst
the
labouring
classes
seemed
imminent
when
sir
john
urged
in
parliament
that
exchequer
notes
to
the
amount
of
five
millions
should
be
issued
immediately
as
a
loan
to
such
merchants
as
could
give
security
this
suggestion
was
adopted
and
his
offer
to
carry
out
his
plan
in
conjunction
with
certain
members
named
by
him
was
also
accepted
the
vote
was
passed
late
at
night
and
early
next
morning
sir
john
anticipating
the
delays
of
officialism
and
red
tape
proceeded
to
bankers
in
the
city
and
borrowed
of
them
on
his
own
personal
security
the
sum
of
which
he
despatched
the
same
evening
to
those
merchants
who
were
in
the
most
urgent
need
of
assistance
pitt
meeting
sir
john
in
the
house
expressed
his
great
regret
that
the
pressing
wants
of
manchester
and
glasgow
could
not
be
supplied
so
soon
as
was
desirable
adding
the
money
can
not
be
raised
for
some
it
is
already
gone
it
left
london
by
s
mail
was
sir
john
s
triumphant
reply
and
in
afterwards
relating
the
anecdote
he
added
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
pitt
was
as
much
startled
as
if
i
had
stabbed
to
the
last
this
great
good
man
worked
on
usefully
and
cheerfully
setting
a
great
example
for
his
family
and
for
his
country
in
so
laboriously
seeking
others
good
it
might
be
said
that
he
found
his
wealth
for
his
generosity
seriously
impaired
his
private
fortune
but
happiness
and
and
the
peace
that
passes
knowledge
a
great
patriot
with
magnificent
powers
of
work
he
nobly
did
his
duty
to
his
country
yet
he
was
not
neglectful
of
his
own
household
and
home
his
sons
and
daughters
grew
up
to
honour
and
usefulness
and
it
was
one
of
the
proudest
things
sir
john
could
say
when
verging
on
his
eightieth
year
that
he
had
lived
to
see
seven
sons
grown
up
not
one
of
whom
had
incurred
a
debt
he
could
not
pay
or
caused
him
a
sorrow
that
could
have
been
avoided

i

enough
to
believe
that

may

hence
lord
john
russell
once
observed
in
a
sentence
full
of
truth
it
is
the
nature
of
party
in
england
to
ask
the
assistance
of
men
of
genius
but
to
follow
the
guidance
of
men
of
this
was
strikingly
illustrated
in
the
career
of
the
late
francis
man
of
whom
sydney
smith
said
that
the
ten
commandments
were
stamped
upon
his
countenance
the
valuable
and
peculiar
light
says
lord
cockburn
in
which
his
history
is
calculated
to
inspire
every
youth
is
this
he
died
at
the
age
of
possessed
of
greater
public
influence
than
any
other
private
man
and
admired
beloved
trusted
and
deplored
by
all
except
the
heartless
or
the
base
no
greater
homage
was
ever
paid
in
parliament
to
any
deceased
member
now
let
every
young
man
was
this
attained
by
rank
he
was
the
son
of
an
edinburgh
merchant
by
wealth
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
relations
ever
had
a
superfluous
sixpence
by
office
he
held
but
one
and
only
for
a
few
years
of
no
influence
and
with
very
little
pay
by
talents
his
were
not
splendid
and
he
had
no
genius
cautious
and
slow
his
only
ambition
was
to
be
right
by
eloquence
he
spoke
in
calm
good
taste
without
any
of
the
oratory
that
either
terrifies
or
seduces
by
any
fascination
of
manner
his
was
only
correct
and
agreeable
by
what
then
was
it
merely
by
sense
industry
good
principles
and
a
good
which
no
mind
need
ever
despair
of
attaining
it
was
the
force
of
his
character
that
raised
him
and
this
character
not
impressed
upon
him
by
nature
but
formed
out
of
no
peculiarly
fine
elements
by
himself
there
were
many
in
the
house
of
commons
of
far
greater
ability
and
eloquence
but
no
one
surpassed
him
in
the
combination
of
an
adequate
portion
of
these
with
moral
worth
horner
was
born
to
show
what
moderate
powers
unaided
by
anything
whatever
except
culture
and
goodness
may
achieve
even
when
these
powers
are
displayed
amidst
the
competition
and
jealousy
of
public
franklin
also
attributed
his
success
as
a
public
man
not
to
his
talents
or
his
powers
of
these
were
but
to
his
known
integrity
of
character
hence
it
was
he
says
that
i
had
so
much
weight
with
my
fellow
citizens
i
was
but
a
bad
speaker
never
eloquent
subject
to
much
hesitation
in
my
choice
of
words
hardly
correct
in
language
and
yet
i
generally
carried
my
character
creates
confidence
in
men
in
high
station
as
well
as
in
humble
life
it
was
said
of
the
first
emperor
alexander
of
russia
that
his
personal
character
was
equivalent
to
a
constitution
during
the
wars
of
the
fronde
montaigne
was
the
only
man
amongst
the
french
gentry
who
kept
his
castle
gates
unbarred
and
it
was
said
of
him
that
his
personal
character
was
a
better
protection
for
him
than
a
regiment
of
horse
would
have
been
that
character
is
power
is
true
in
a
much
higher
sense
than
that
knowledge
is
power
mind
without
heart
intelligence
without
conduct
cleverness
without
goodness
are
powers
in
their
way
but
they
may
be
powers
only
for
mischief
we
may
be
instructed
or
amused
by
them
but
it
is
sometimes
as
difficult
to
admire
them
as
it
would
be
to
admire
the
dexterity
of
a
pickpocket
or
the
horsemanship
of
a
highwayman
truthfulness
integrity
and
that
hang
not
on
any
man
s
the
essence
of
manly
character
or
as
one
of
our
old
writers
has
it
that
inbred
loyalty
unto
virtue
which
can
serve
her
without
a
he
who
possesses
these
qualities
united
with
strength
of
purpose
carries
with
him
a
power
which
is
irresistible
he
is
strong
to
do
good
strong
to
resist
evil
and
strong
to
bear
up
under
difficulty
and
misfortune
when
stephen
of
colonna
fell
into
the
hands
of
his
base
assailants
and
they
asked
him
in
derision
where
is
now
your
fortress
here
was
his
bold
reply
placing
his
hand
upon
his
heart
it
is
in
misfortune
that
the
character
of
the
upright
man
shines
forth
with
the
greatest
lustre
and
when
all
else
fails
he
takes
stand
upon
his
integrity
and
his
courage
the
rules
of
conduct
followed
by
lord
man
of
sterling
independence
of
principle
and
scrupulous
adherence
to
worthy
of
being
engraven
on
every
young
man
s
heart
it
was
a
first
command
and
counsel
of
my
earliest
youth
he
said
always
to
do
what
my
conscience
told
me
to
be
a
duty
and
to
leave
the
consequence
to
god
i
shall
carry
with
me
the
memory
and
i
trust
the
practice
of
this
parental
lesson
to
the
grave
i
have
hitherto
followed
it
and
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
that
my
obedience
to
it
has
been
a
temporal
sacrifice
i
have
found
it
on
the
contrary
the
road
to
prosperity
and
wealth
and
i
shall
point
out
the
same
path
to
my
children
for
their
every
man
is
bound
to
aim
at
the
possession
of
a
good
character
as
one
of
the
highest
objects
of
life
the
very
effort
to
secure
it
by
worthy
means
will
furnish
him
with
a
motive
for
exertion
and
his
idea
of
manhood
in
proportion
as
it
is
elevated
will
steady
and
animate
his
motive
it
is
well
to
have
a
high
standard
of
life
even
though
we
may
not
be
able
altogether
to
realize
it
the
youth
says
disraeli
who
does
not
look
up
will
look
down
and
the
spirit
that
does
not
soar
is
destined
perhaps
to
george
herbert
wisely
writes
pitch
thy
behaviour
low
thy
projects
high
so
shall
thou
humble
and
magnanimous
be
sink
not
in
spirit
who
aimeth
at
the
sky
shoots
higher
much
than
he
that
means
a
he
who
has
a
high
standard
of
living
and
thinking
will
certainly
do
better
than
he
who
has
none
at
all
pluck
at
a
gown
of
gold
says
the
scotch
proverb
and
you
may
get
a
sleeve
o
whoever
tries
for
the
highest
results
can
not
fail
to
reach
a
point
far
in
advance
of
that
from
which
he
started
and
though
the
end
attained
may
fall
short
of
that
proposed
still
the
very
effort
to
rise
of
itself
can
not
fail
to
prove
permanently
beneficial
there
are
many
counterfeits
of
character
but
the
genuine
article
is
difficult
to
be
mistaken
some
knowing
its
money
value
would
assume
its
disguise
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
upon
the
unwary
colonel
charteris
said

distinguished
for
his
honesty
i
would
give
a
thousand
pounds
for
your
good

because
i
could
make
ten
thousand
by
it
was
the
knave
s
reply
integrity
in
word
and
deed
is
the
backbone
of
character
and
loyal
adherence
to
veracity
its
most
prominent
characteristic
one
of
the
finest
testimonies
to
the
character
of
the
late
sir
robert
peel
was
that
borne
by
the
duke
of
wellington
in
the
house
of
lords
a
few
days
after
the
great
statesman
s
death
your
lordships
he
said
must
all
feel
the
high
and
honourable
character
of
the
late
sir
robert
peel
i
was
long
connected
with
him
in
public
life
we
were
both
in
the
councils
of
our
sovereign
together
and
i
had
long
the
honour
to
enjoy
his
private
friendship
in
all
the
course
of
my
acquaintance
with
him
i
never
knew
a
man
in
whose
truth
and
justice
i
had
greater
confidence
or
in
whom
i
saw
a
more
invariable
desire
to
promote
the
public
service
in
the
whole
course
of
my
communication
with
him
i
never
knew
an
instance
in
which
he
did
not
show
the
strongest
attachment
to
truth
and
i
never
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
the
smallest
reason
for
suspecting
that
he
stated
anything
which
he
did
not
firmly
believe
to
be
the
and
this
truthfulness
of
the
statesman
was
no
doubt
the
secret
of
no
small
part
of
his
influence
and
power
there
is
a
truthfulness
in
action
as
well
as
in
words
which
is
essential
to
uprightness
of
character
a
man
must
really
be
what
he
seems
or
purposes
to
be
when
an
american
gentleman
wrote
to
granville
sharp
that
from
respect
for
his
great
virtues
he
had
named
one
of
his
sons
after
him
sharp
replied
i
must
request
you
to
teach
him
a
favourite
maxim
of
the
family
whose
name
you
have
given
endeavour
to
be
really
what
you
would
wish
to
this
maxim
as
my
father
informed
me
was
carefully
and
humbly
practised
by
father
whose
sincerity
as
a
plain
and
honest
man
thereby
became
the
principal
feature
of
his
character
both
in
public
and
private
every
man
who
respects
himself
and
values
the
respect
of
others
will
carry
out
the
maxim
in
honestly
what
he
proposes
to
the
highest
character
into
his
work
scamping
nothing
but
priding
himself
upon
his
integrity
and
conscientiousness
once
cromwell
said
to
bernard
clever
but
somewhat
unscrupulous
lawyer
i
understand
that
you
have
lately
been
vastly
wary
in
your
conduct
do
not
be
too
confident
of
this
subtlety
may
deceive
you
integrity
never
men
whose
acts
are
at
direct
variance
with
their
words
command
no
respect
and
what
they
say
has
but
little
weight
even
truths
when
uttered
by
them
seem
to
come
blasted
from
their
lips
the
true
character
acts
rightly
whether
in
secret
or
in
the
sight
of
men
that
boy
was
well
trained
who
when
asked
why
he
did
not
pocket
some
pears
for
nobody
was
there
to

replied
yes
there
was
i
was
there
to
see
myself
and
i
don

intend
ever
to

a
dishonest
is
a
simple
but
not
inappropriate
illustration
of
principle
or
conscience
dominating
in
the
character
and
exercising
a
noble
protectorate
over
it
not
merely
a
passive
influence
but
an
active
power
regulating
the
life
such
a
principle
goes
on
moulding
the
character
hourly
and
daily
growing
with
a
force
that
operates
every
moment
without
this
dominating
influence
character
has
no
protection
but
is
constantly
liable
to
fall
away
before
temptation
and
every
such
temptation
succumbed
to
every
act
of
meanness
or
dishonesty
however
slight
causes
it
matters
not
whether
the
act
be
successful
or
not
discovered
or
concealed
the
culprit
is
no
longer
the
same
but
another
person
and
he
is
pursued
by
a
secret
uneasiness
by
or
the
workings
of
what
we
call
conscience
which
is
the
inevitable
doom
of
the
guilty
and
here
it
may
be
observed
how
greatly
the
character
may
be
strengthened
and
supported
by
the
cultivation
of
good
habits
man
it
has
been
said
is
a
bundle
of
habits
and
habit
is
second
nature
metastasio
entertained
so
strong
an
opinion
as
to
the
power
of
repetition
in
act
and
thought
that
he
said
all
is
habit
in
mankind
even
virtue
butler
in
his
analogy
impresses
the
importance
of
careful
and
firm
resistance
to
temptation
as
tending
to
make
virtue
habitual
so
that
at
length
it
may
become
more
easy
to
be
good
than
to
give
way
to
sin
as
habits
belonging
to
the
body
he
says
are
produced
by
external
acts
so
habits
of
the
mind
are
produced
by
the
execution
of
inward
practical
purposes
carrying
them
into
act
or
acting
upon
principles
of
obedience
veracity
justice
and
and
again
lord
brougham
says
when
enforcing
the
immense
importance
of
training
and
example
in
youth
i
trust
everything
under
god
to
habit
on
which
in
all
ages
the
lawgiver
as
well
as
the
schoolmaster
has
mainly
placed
his
reliance
habit
which
makes
everything
easy
and
casts
the
difficulties
upon
the
deviation
from
a
wonted
thus
make
sobriety
a
habit
and
intemperance
will
be
hateful
make
prudence
a
habit
and
reckless
profligacy
will
become
revolting
to
every
principle
of
conduct
which
regulates
the
life
of
the
individual
hence
the
necessity
for
the
greatest
care
and
watchfulness
against
the
inroad
of
any
evil
habit
for
the
character
is
always
weakest
at
that
point
at
which
it
has
once
given
way
and
it
is
long
before
a
principle
restored
can
become
so
firm
as
one
that
has
never
been
moved
it
is
a
fine
remark
of
a
russian
writer
that
habits
are
a
necklace
of
pearls
untie
the
knot
and
the
whole
wherever
formed
habit
acts
involuntarily
and
without
effort
and
it
is
only
when
you
oppose
it
that
you
find
how
powerful
it
has
become
what
is
done
once
and
again
soon
gives
facility
and
proneness
the
habit
at
first
may
seem
to
have
no
more
strength
than
a
spider
s
web
but
once
formed
it
binds
as
with
a
chain
of
iron
the
small
events
of
life
taken
singly
may
seem
exceedingly
unimportant
like
snow
that
falls
silently
flake
by
flake
yet
accumulated
these
form
the
avalanche
application
industry
are
of
the
nature
of
habits
not
beliefs
principles
in
fact
are
but
the
names
which
we
assign
to
habits
for
the
principles
are
words
but
the
habits
are
the
things
themselves
benefactors
or
tyrants
according
as
they
are
good
or
evil
it
thus
happens
that
as
we
grow
older
a
portion
of
our
free
activity
and
individuality
becomes
suspended
in
habit
our
actions
become
of
the
nature
of
fate
and
we
are
bound
by
the
chains
which
we
have
woven
around
ourselves
it
is
indeed
scarcely
possible
to
the
importance
of
training
the
young
to
virtuous
habits
in
them
they
are
the
easiest
formed
and
when
formed
they
last
for
life
like
letters
cut
on
the
bark
of
a
tree
they
grow
and
widen
with
age
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
the
beginning
holds
within
it
the
end
the
first
start
on
the
road
of
life
determines
the
direction
and
the
destination
of
the
journey
n
est
que
le
premier
pas
qui
remember
said
lord
collingwood
to
a
young
man
whom
he
loved
before
you
are
you
must
establish
a
character
that
will
serve
you
all
your
as
habit
strengthens
with
age
and
character
becomes
formed
any
turning
into
a
new
path
becomes
more
and
more
difficult
hence
it
is
often
harder
to
unlearn
than
to
learn
and
for
this
reason
the
grecian
was
justified
who
charged
double
fees
to
those
pupils
who
had
been
taught
by
an
inferior
master
to
uproot
an
old
habit
is
sometimes
a
more
painful
thing
and
vastly
more
difficult
than
to
wrench
out
a
tooth
try
and
reform
a
habitually
indolent
or
improvident
or
drunken
person
and
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
you
will
fail
for
the
habit
in
each
case
has
wound
itself
in
and
through
the
life
until
it
has
become
an
integral
part
of
it
and
can
not
be
uprooted
hence
as
lynch
observes
the
wisest
habit
of
all
is
the
habit
of
care
in
the
formation
of
good
even
happiness
itself
may
become
habitual
there
is
a
habit
of
looking
at
the
bright
side
of
things
and
also
of
looking
at
the
dark
side
johnson
has
said
that
the
habit
of
looking
at
the
best
side
of
a
thing
is
worth
more
to
a
man
than
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
we
possess
the
power
to
a
great
extent
of
so
exercising
the
will
as
to
direct
the
thoughts
upon
objects
calculated
to
yield
happiness
and
improvement
rather
than
their
opposites
in
this
way
the
habit
of
happy
thought
may
be
made
to
spring
up
like
any
other
habit
and
to
bring
up
men
or
women
with
a
genial
nature
of
this
sort
a
good
temper
and
a
happy
frame
of
mind
is
perhaps
of
even
more
importance
in
many
cases
than
to
perfect
them
in
much
knowledge
and
many
accomplishments
as
daylight
can
be
seen
through
very
small
holes
so
little
things
will
illustrate
a
person
s
character
indeed
character
consists
in
little
acts
well
and
honourably
performed
daily
life
being
the
quarry
from
which
we
build
it
up
and
the
habits
which
form
it
one
of
the
most
marked
tests
of
character
is
the
manner
in
which
we
conduct
ourselves
towards
others
a
graceful
behaviour
towards
superiors
inferiors
and
equals
is
a
constant
source
of
pleasure
it
pleases
others
because
it
indicates
respect
for
their
personality
but
it
gives
tenfold
more
pleasure
to
ourselves
every
man
may
to
a
large
extent
be
a
in
good
behaviour
as
in
everything
else
he
can
be
civil
and
kind
if
he
will
though
he
have
not
a
penny
in
his
purse
gentleness
in
society
is
like
the
silent
influence
of
light
which
gives
colour
to
all
nature
it
is
far
more
powerful
than
loudness
or
force
and
far
more
fruitful
it
pushes
its
way
quietly
and
persistently
like
the
tiniest
daffodil
in
spring
which
raises
the
clod
and
thrusts
it
aside
by
the
simple
persistency
of
growing
even
a
kind
look
will
give
pleasure
and
confer
happiness
in
one
of
robertson
of
brighton
s
letters
he
tells
of
a
lady
who
related
to
him
the
delight
the
tears
of
gratitude
which
she
had
witnessed
in
a
poor
girl
to
whom
in
passing
i
gave
a
kind
look
on
going
out
of
church
on
sunday
what
a
lesson
how
cheaply
happiness
can
be
given
what
opportunities
we
miss
of
doing
an
angel
s
work
i
remember
doing
it
full
of
sad
feelings
passing
on
and
thinking
no
more
about
it
and
it
gave
an
hour
s
sunshine
to
a
human
life
and
lightened
the
load
of
life
to
a
human
heart
for
a
time
morals
and
manners
which
give
colour
to
life
are
of
much
greater
importance
than
laws
which
are
but
their
manifestations
the
law
touches
us
here
and
there
but
manners
are
about
us
everywhere
pervading
society
like
the
air
we
breathe
good
manners
as
we
call
them
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
good
behaviour
consisting
of
courtesy
and
kindness
benevolence
being
the
preponderating
element
in
all
kinds
of
mutually
beneficial
and
pleasant
intercourse
amongst
human
beings
civility
said
lady
montague
costs
nothing
and
buys
the
cheapest
of
all
things
is
kindness
its
exercise
requiring
the
least
possible
trouble
and
win
hearts
said
burleigh
to
queen
elizabeth
and
you
have
all
men
s
hearts
and
if
we
would
only
let
nature
act
kindly
free
from
affectation
and
artifice
the
results
on
social
good
humour
and
happiness
would
be
incalculable
the
little
courtesies
which
form
the
small
change
of
life
may
separately
appear
of
little
intrinsic
value
but
they
acquire
their
importance
from
repetition
and
accumulation
they
are
like
the
spare
minutes
or
the
groat
a
day
which
proverbially
produce
such
momentous
results
in
the
course
of
a
twelvemonth
or
in
a
lifetime
manners
are
the
ornament
of
action
and
there
is
a
way
of
speaking
a
kind
word
or
of
doing
a
kind
thing
which
greatly
enhances
their
value
what
seems
to
be
done
with
a
grudge
or
as
an
act
of
condescension
is
scarcely
accepted
as
a
favour
yet
there
are
men
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
gruffness
and
though
they
may
possess
virtue
and
capacity
their
manner
is
often
such
as
to
render
them
almost
insupportable
it
is
difficult
to
like
a
man
who
though
he
may
not
pull
your
nose
habitually
wounds
your
and
takes
a
pride
in
saying
disagreeable
things
to
you
there
are
others
who
are
dreadfully
condescending
and
can
not
avoid
seizing
upon
every
small
opportunity
of
making
their
greatness
felt
when
abernethy
was
canvassing
for
the
office
of
surgeon
to
bartholomew
hospital
he
called
upon
such
a
rich
grocer
one
of
the
governors
the
great
man
behind
the
counter
seeing
the
great
surgeon
enter
immediately
assumed
the
grand
air
towards
the
supposed
suppliant
for
his
vote
i
presume
sir
you
want
my
vote
and
interest
at
this
momentous
epoch
of
your
life
abernethy
who
hated
humbugs
and
felt
nettled
at
the
tone
replied
no
i
don
t
i
want
a
pennyworth
of
figs
come
look
sharp
and
wrap
them
up
i
want
to
be
off
the
cultivation
of
in
excess
it
is
foppish
and
highly
necessary
in
a
person
who
has
occasion
to
negociate
with
others
in
matters
of
business
affability
and
good
breeding
may
even
be
regarded
as
essential
to
the
success
of
a
man
in
any
eminent
station
and
enlarged
sphere
of
life
for
the
want
of
it
has
not
unfrequently
been
found
in
a
great
measure
to
neutralise
the
results
of
much
industry
integrity
and
honesty
of
character
there
are
no
doubt
a
few
strong
tolerant
minds
which
can
bear
with
defects
and
angularities
of
manner
and
look
only
to
the
more
genuine
qualities
but
the
world
at
large
is
not
so
forbearant
and
can
not
help
forming
its
judgments
and
likings
mainly
according
to
outward
conduct
another
mode
of
displaying
true
politeness
is
consideration
for
the
opinions
of
others
it
has
been
said
of
dogmatism
that
it
is
only
puppyism
come
to
its
full
growth
and
certainly
the
worst
form
this
quality
can
assume
is
that
of
opinionativeness
and
arrogance
let
men
agree
to
differ
and
when
they
do
differ
bear
and
forbear
principles
and
opinions
may
be
maintained
with
perfect
suavity
without
coming
to
blows
or
uttering
hard
words
and
there
are
circumstances
in
which
words
are
blows
and
inflict
wounds
far
less
easy
to
heal
as
bearing
upon
this
point
we
quote
an
instructive
little
parable
spoken
some
time
since
by
an
itinerant
preacher
of
the
evangelical
alliance
on
the
borders
of
wales
as
i
was
going
to
the
hills
said
he
early
one
misty
morning
i
saw
something
moving
on
a
mountain
side
so
strange
looking
that
i
took
it
for
a
monster
when
i
came
nearer
to
it
i
found
it
was
a
man
when
i
came
up
to
him
i
found
he
was
my
the
inbred
politeness
which
springs
from
and
kindly
feelings
is
of
no
exclusive
rank
or
station
the
mechanic
who
works
at
the
bench
may
possess
it
as
well
as
the
clergyman
or
the
peer
it
is
by
no
means
a
necessary
condition
of
labour
that
it
should
in
any
respect
be
either
rough
or
coarse
the
politeness
and
refinement
which
distinguish
all
classes
of
the
people
in
many
continental
countries
show
that
those
qualities
might
become
ours
doubtless
they
will
become
with
increased
culture
and
more
general
social
sacrificing
any
of
our
more
genuine
qualities
as
men
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
the
richest
to
the
poorest
to
no
rank
or
condition
in
life
has
nature
denied
her
highest
great
heart
there
never
yet
existed
a
gentleman
but
was
lord
of
a
great
heart
and
this
may
exhibit
itself
under
the
hodden
grey
of
the
peasant
as
well
as
under
the
laced
coat
of
the
noble
robert
burns
was
once
taken
to
task
by
a
young
edinburgh
blood
with
whom
he
was
walking
for
recognising
an
honest
farmer
in
the
open
street
why
you
fantastic
gomeral
exclaimed
burns
it
was
not
the
great
coat
the
scone
bonnet
and
the
hose
that
i
spoke
to
but
that
was
in
them
and
the
man
sir
for
true
worth
would
weigh
down
you
and
me
and
ten
more
such
any
there
may
be
a
homeliness
in
externals
which
may
seem
vulgar
to
those
who
can
not
discern
the
heart
beneath
but
to
the
character
will
always
have
its
clear
insignia
william
and
charles
grant
were
the
sons
of
a
farmer
in
whom
a
sudden
flood
stripped
of
everything
even
to
the
very
soil
which
he
tilled
the
farmer
and
his
sons
with
the
world
before
them
where
to
choose
made
their
way
southward
in
search
of
employment
until
they
arrived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bury
in
lancashire
from
the
crown
of
the
hill
near
walmesley
they
surveyed
the
wide
extent
of
country
which
lay
before
them
the
river
irwell
making
its
circuitous
course
through
the
valley
they
were
utter
strangers
in
the
neighbourhood
and
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
to
decide
their
course
they
put
up
a
stick
and
agreed
to
pursue
the
direction
in
which
it
fell
thus
their
decision
was
made
and
they
journeyed
on
accordingly
until
they
reached
the
village
of
ramsbotham
not
far
distant
they
found
employment
in
a
in
which
william
served
his
apprenticeship
and
they
commanded
themselves
to
their
employers
by
their
diligence
sobriety
and
strict
integrity
they
plodded
on
rising
from
one
station
to
another
until
at
length
the
two
men
themselves
became
employers
and
after
many
long
years
of
industry
enterprise
and
benevolence
they
became
rich
honoured
and
respected
by
all
who
knew
them
their
and
gave
employment
to
a
large
population
their
diligence
made
the
valley
teem
with
activity
joy
health
and
opulence
out
of
their
abundant
wealth
they
gave
liberally
to
all
worthy
objects
erecting
churches
founding
schools
and
in
all
ways
promoting
the
of
the
class
of
from
which
they
had
sprung
they
afterwards
erected
on
the
top
of
the
hill
above
walmesley
a
lofty
tower
in
commemoration
of
the
early
event
in
their
history
which
had
determined
the
place
of
their
settlement
the
brothers
grant
became
widely
celebrated
for
their
benevolence
and
their
various
goodness
and
it
is
said
that
dickens
had
them
in
his
mind
s
eye
when
delineating
the
character
of
the
brothers
cheeryble
one
amongst
many
anecdotes
of
a
similar
kind
may
be
cited
to
show
that
the
character
was
by
no
means
exaggerated
a
manchester
warehouseman
published
an
exceedingly
scurrilous
pamphlet
against
the
firm
of
grant
brothers
holding
up
the
elder
partner
to
ridicule
as
billy
william
was
informed
by
some
one
of
the
nature
of
the
pamphlet
and
his
observation
was
that
the
man
would
live
to
repent
of
it
oh
said
the
libeller
when
informed
of
the
remark
he
thinks
that
some
time
or
other
i
shall
be
in
his
debt
but
i
will
take
good
care
of
it
happens
however
that
men
in
business
do
not
always
foresee
who
shall
be
their
creditor
and
it
so
turned
out
that
the
grants
libeller
became
a
bankrupt
and
could
not
complete
his
certificate
and
begin
business
again
without
obtaining
their
signature
it
seemed
to
him
a
hopeless
case
to
call
upon
that
firm
for
any
favour
but
the
pressing
claims
of
his
family
forced
him
to
make
the
application
he
appeared
before
the
man
whom
he
had
ridiculed
as
billy
button
accordingly
he
told
his
tale
and
produced
his
certificate
you
wrote
a
pamphlet
against
us
once
said
grant
the
supplicant
expected
to
see
his
document
thrown
into
the
fire
instead
of
which
grant
signed
the
name
of
the
firm
and
thus
completed
the
necessary
certificate
we
make
it
a
rule
said
he
handing
it
back
never
to
refuse
signing
the
certificate
of
an
honest
tradesman
and
we
have
never
heard
that
you
were
anything
the
tears
started
into
the
man
s
eyes
ah
continued
grant
you
see
my
saying
was
true
that
you
would
live
to
repent
writing
that
pamphlet
i
did
not
mean
it
as
a
only
meant
that
some
day
you
would
know
us
better
and
repent
having
tried
to
injure
i
do
i
do
indeed
repent
well
well
you
know
us
now
but
how
do
you
get
are
you
going
to
do
the
poor
man
stated
that
he
had
friends
who
would
assist
him
when
his
certificate
was
obtained
but
how
are
you
off
in
the
mean
time
the
answer
was
that
having
given
up
every
farthing
to
his
creditors
he
had
been
compelled
to
stint
his
family
in
even
the
common
necessaries
of
life
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
pay
for
his
certificate
my
good
fellow
this
will
never
do
your
wife
and
family
must
not
suffer
in
this
way
be
kind
enough
to
take
this
note
to
your
wife
from
me
there
there
t
cry
it
will
be
all
well
with
you
yet
keep
up
your
spirits
set
to
work
like
a
man
and
you
will
raise
your
head
among
the
best
of
us
the
overpowered
man
endeavoured
with
choking
utterance
to
express
his
gratitude
but
in
vain
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
face
he
went
out
of
the
room
sobbing
like
a
child
the
true
gentleman
is
one
whose
nature
has
been
fashioned
after
the
highest
models
it
is
a
grand
old
name
that
of
gentleman
and
has
been
recognized
as
a
rank
and
power
in
all
stages
of
society
the
gentleman
is
always
the
gentleman
said
the
old
french
general
to
his
regiment
of
scottish
gentry
at
rousillon
and
invariably
proves
himself
such
in
need
and
in
to
possess
this
character
is
a
dignity
of
itself
commanding
the
instinctive
homage
of
every
generous
mind
and
those
who
will
not
bow
to
titular
rank
will
yet
do
homage
to
the
gentleman
his
qualities
depend
not
upon
fashion
or
manners
but
upon
moral
on
personal
possessions
but
on
personal
qualities
the
psalmist
briefly
describes
him
as
one
that
walketh
uprightly
and
worketh
righteousness
and
speaketh
the
truth
in
his
the
gentleman
is
eminently
distinguished
for
his
he
values
his
character
so
much
of
it
only
as
can
be
seen
of
others
but
as
he
sees
it
himself
having
regard
for
the
approval
of
his
inward
monitor
and
as
he
respects
himself
so
by
the
same
law
does
he
respect
others
humanity
is
sacred
in
his
eyes
and
thence
proceed
politeness
and
forbearance
kindness
and
charity
it
is
related
of
lord
edward
fitzgerald
that
while
travelling
in
canada
in
company
with
the
indians
he
was
shocked
by
the
sight
of
a
poor
squaw
trudging
along
laden
with
her
husband
s
trappings
while
the
chief
himself
walked
on
unencumbered
lord
edward
at
once
relieved
the
squaw
of
her
pack
by
placing
it
upon
his
own
shoulders
beautiful
instance
of
what
the
french
call
de
inbred
politeness
of
the
true
gentleman
the
true
gentleman
has
a
keen
sense
of
honour
avoiding
mean
actions
his
standard
of
probity
in
word
and
action
is
high
he
does
not
shuffle
or
prevaricate
dodge
or
skulk
but
is
honest
upright
and
straightforward
his
law
is
in
right
lines
when
he
says
it
is
a
law
and
he
dares
to
say
the
valiant
at
the
fitting
season
the
gentleman
will
not
be
bribed
only
the
and
unprincipled
will
sell
themselves
to
those
who
are
interested
in
buying
them
when
the
upright
jonas
hanway
officiated
as
commissioner
in
the
victualling
department
he
declined
to
receive
a
present
of
any
kind
from
a
contractor
refusing
thus
to
be
biassed
in
the
performance
of
his
public
duty
a
fine
trait
of
the
same
kind
is
to
be
noted
in
the
life
of
the
duke
of
wellington
shortly
after
the
battle
of
assaye
one
morning
the
prime
minister
of
the
court
of
hyderabad
waited
upon
him
for
the
purpose
of
privately
ascertaining
what
territory
and
what
advantages
had
been
reserved
for
his
master
in
the
treaty
of
peace
between
the
mahratta
princes
and
the
nizam
to
obtain
this
information
the
minister
offered
the
general
a
very
large
above
looking
at
him
quietly
for
a
few
seconds
sir
arthur
said
it
appears
then
that
you
are
capable
of
keeping
a
secret
yes
certainly
replied
the
minister
so
am
said
the
english
general
smiling
and
bowed
the
minister
out
it
was
to
wellington
s
great
honour
that
though
uniformly
successful
in
india
and
with
the
power
of
earning
in
such
modes
as
this
enormous
wealth
he
did
not
add
a
farthing
to
his
fortune
and
returned
to
england
a
comparatively
poor
man
a
similar
sensitiveness
and
characterised
his
noble
relative
the
marquis
of
wellesley
who
on
one
occasion
positively
refused
a
present
of
proposed
to
be
given
him
by
the
directors
of
the
east
india
company
on
the
conquest
of
mysore
it
is
not
necessary
said
he
for
me
to
allude
to
the
independence
of
my
character
and
the
proper
dignity
attaching
to
my
office
other
reasons
besides
these
important
considerations
lead
me
to
decline
this
testimony
which
is
not
suitable
to
me
think
of
nothing
but
our
i
should
be
much
distressed
to
curtail
the
share
of
those
brave
and
the
marquis
s
resolution
to
refuse
the
present
remained
unalterable
sir
charles
napier
exhibited
the
same
noble
in
the
course
of
his
indian
career
he
rejected
all
the
costly
gifts
which
barbaric
princes
were
ready
to
lay
at
his
feet
and
said
with
truth
certainly
i
could
have
got
since
my
coming
to
scinde
but
my
hands
do
not
want
washing
yet
our
dear
father
s
sword
which
i
wore
in
both
battles
meanee
and
hyderabad
is
riches
and
rank
have
no
necessary
connexion
with
genuine
gentlemanly
qualities
the
poor
man
may
be
a
true
gentleman
spirit
and
in
daily
life
he
may
be
honest
truthful
upright
polite
temperate
courageous
and
is
be
a
true
gentleman
the
poor
man
with
a
rich
spirit
is
in
all
ways
superior
to
the
rich
man
with
a
poor
spirit
to
borrow
paul
s
words
the
former
is
as
having
nothing
yet
possessing
all
things
while
the
other
though
possessing
all
things
has
nothing
the
first
hopes
everything
and
fears
nothing
the
last
hopes
nothing
and
fears
everything
only
the
poor
in
spirit
are
really
poor
he
who
has
lost
all
but
retains
his
courage
cheerfulness
hope
virtue
and
is
still
rich
for
such
a
man
the
world
is
as
it
were
held
in
trust
his
spirit
dominating
over
its
grosser
cares
he
can
still
walk
erect
a
true
gentleman
occasionally
the
brave
and
gentle
character
may
be
found
under
the
humblest
garb
here
is
an
old
illustration
but
a
fine
one
once
on
a
time
when
the
adige
suddenly
overflowed
its
banks
the
bridge
of
verona
was
carried
away
with
the
exception
of
the
centre
arch
on
which
stood
a
house
whose
inhabitants
supplicated
help
from
the
windows
while
the
foundations
were
visibly
giving
way
i
will
give
a
hundred
french
louis
said
the
count
spolverini
who
stood
by
to
any
person
who
will
venture
to
deliver
these
unfortunate
a
young
peasant
came
forth
from
the
crowd
seized
a
boat
and
pushed
into
the
stream
he
gained
the
pier
received
the
whole
family
into
the
boat
and
made
for
the
shore
where
he
landed
them
in
safety
here
is
your
money
my
brave
young
fellow
said
the
count
no
was
the
answer
of
the
young
man
i
do
not
sell
my
life
give
the
money
to
this
poor
family
who
have
need
of
here
spoke
the
true
spirit
of
the
gentleman
though
he
was
but
in
the
garb
of
a
peasant
not
less
touching
was
the
heroic
conduct
of
a
party
of
deal
boatmen
in
rescuing
the
crew
of
a
in
the
downs
but
a
short
time
ago
a
sudden
storm
which
set
in
from
the
drove
several
ships
from
their
anchors
and
it
being
low
water
one
of
them
struck
the
ground
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
shore
when
the
sea
made
a
clean
breach
over
her
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
hope
for
the
vessel
such
was
the
fury
of
the
wind
and
the
violence
of
the
waves
there
was
nothing
to
tempt
the
boatmen
on
shore
to
risk
their
lives
in
saving
either
ship
or
crew
for
not
a
farthing
of
salvage
was
to
be
looked
for
but
the
daring
intrepidity
of
the
deal
boatmen
was
not
wanting
at
this
critical
moment
no
sooner
had
the
brig
grounded
than
simon
pritchard
one
of
the
many
persons
assembled
along
the
beach
threw
off
his
coat
and
called
out
who
will
come
with
me
and
try
to
save
that
crew
instantly
twenty
men
sprang
forward
with
i
will
and
but
seven
only
were
wanted
and
running
down
a
galley
punt
into
the
surf
they
leaped
in
and
dashed
through
the
breakers
amidst
the
cheers
of
those
on
shore
how
the
boat
lived
in
such
a
sea
seemed
a
miracle
but
in
a
few
minutes
impelled
by
the
strong
arms
of
these
gallant
men
she
flew
on
and
reached
the
stranded
ship
catching
her
on
the
top
of
a
wave
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
time
the
boat
left
the
shore
the
six
men
who
composed
the
crew
of
the
collier
were
landed
safe
on
walmer
beach
a
nobler
instance
of
indomitable
courage
and
disinterested
heroism
on
the
part
of
the
deal
though
they
are
always
known
to
can
not
be
cited
and
we
have
pleasure
in
here
placing
it
on
record
turnbull
in
his
work
on
austria
relates
an
anecdote
of
the
late
emperor
francis
in
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
government
of
that
country
has
been
indebted
for
its
hold
upon
the
people
to
the
personal
qualities
of
its
princes
at
the
time
when
the
cholera
was
raging
at
vienna
the
emperor
with
an
was
strolling
about
the
streets
of
the
city
and
suburbs
when
a
corpse
was
dragged
past
on
a
litter
unaccompanied
by
a
single
mourner
the
unusual
circumstance
attracted
his
attention
and
he
learnt
on
inquiry
that
the
deceased
was
a
poor
person
who
had
died
of
cholera
and
that
the
relatives
had
not
ventured
on
what
was
then
considered
the
very
dangerous
office
of
attending
the
body
to
the
grave
then
said
francis
we
will
supply
their
place
for
none
of
my
poor
people
should
go
to
the
grave
without
that
last
mark
of
respect
and
he
followed
the
body
to
the
distant
place
of
interment
and
stood
to
see
every
rite
and
observance
respectfully
fine
though
this
illustration
may
be
of
the
qualities
of
the
gentleman
we
can
match
it
by
another
equally
good
of
two
english
navvies
in
paris
as
related
in
a
morning
paper
a
few
years
ago
one
day
a
hearse
was
observed
ascending
the
steep
rue
de
clichy
on
its
way
to
montmartre
bearing
a
coffin
of
poplar
wood
with
its
cold
corpse
not
a
soul
even
the
living
dog
of
the
dead
man
if
he
had
one
the
day
was
rainy
and
dismal
passers
by
lifted
the
hat
as
is
usual
when
a
funeral
passes
and
that
was
all
at
length
it
passed
two
english
navvies
who
found
themselves
in
paris
on
their
way
from
spain
a
right
feeling
spoke
from
beneath
their
serge
jackets
poor
wretch
said
the
one
to
the
other
no
one
follows
him
let
us
two
follow
and
the
two
took
off
their
hats
and
walked
after
the
corpse
of
a
stranger
to
the
cemetery
of
above
all
the
gentleman
is
truthful
he
feels
that
truth
is
the
summit
of
being
and
the
soul
of
rectitude
in
human
affairs
lord
chesterfield
declared
that
truth
made
the
success
of
a
gentleman
the
duke
of
wellington
writing
to
kellerman
on
the
subject
of
prisoners
on
parole
when
opposed
to
that
general
in
the
peninsula
told
him
that
if
there
was
one
thing
on
which
an
english
officer
prided
himself
more
than
another
excepting
his
courage
it
was
his
truthfulness
when
english
officers
said
he
have
given
their
parole
of
honour
not
to
escape
be
sure
they
will
not
break
it
believe
to
their
word
the
word
of
an
english
officer
is
a
surer
guarantee
than
the
vigilance
of
true
courage
and
gentleness
go
hand
in
hand
the
brave
man
is
generous
and
forbearant
never
unforgiving
and
cruel
it
was
finely
said
of
sir
john
franklin
by
his
friend
parry
that
he
was
a
man
who
never
turned
his
back
upon
a
danger
yet
of
that
tenderness
that
he
would
not
brush
away
a
a
fine
trait
of
gentle
and
worthy
of
the
spirit
of
displayed
by
a
french
officer
in
the
cavalry
combat
of
el
bodon
in
spain
he
had
raised
his
sword
to
strike
sir
felton
harvey
but
perceiving
his
antagonist
had
only
one
arm
he
instantly
stopped
brought
down
his
sword
before
sir
felton
in
the
usual
salute
and
rode
past
to
this
may
be
added
a
noble
and
gentle
deed
of
ney
during
the
same
peninsular
war
charles
napier
was
taken
prisoner
at
corunna
desperately
wounded
and
his
friends
at
home
did
not
know
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
a
special
messenger
was
sent
out
from
england
with
a
frigate
to
ascertain
his
fate
baron
clouet
received
the
flag
and
informed
ney
of
the
arrival
let
the
prisoner
see
his
friends
said
ney
and
tell
them
he
is
well
and
well
clouet
lingered
and
ney
asked
smiling
what
more
he
wanted
he
has
an
old
mother
a
widow
and
has
he
then
let
him
go
himself
and
tell
her
he
is
as
the
exchange
of
prisoners
between
the
countries
was
not
then
allowed
ney
knew
that
he
risked
the
displeasure
of
the
emperor
by
setting
the
young
officer
at
liberty
but
napoleon
approved
the
generous
act
notwithstanding
the
wail
which
we
occasionally
hear
for
the
chivalry
that
is
gone
our
own
age
has
witnessed
deeds
of
bravery
and
heroic
and
manly
are
unsurpassed
in
history
the
events
of
the
last
few
years
have
shown
that
our
countrymen
are
as
yet
an
undegenerate
race
on
the
bleak
plateau
of
sebastopol
in
the
dripping
perilous
trenches
of
that
twelvemonth
s
leaguer
men
of
all
classes
proved
themselves
worthy
of
the
noble
inheritance
of
character
which
their
forefathers
have
bequeathed
to
them
but
it
was
in
the
hour
of
the
great
trial
in
india
that
the
qualities
of
our
countrymen
shone
forth
the
brightest
the
march
of
neill
on
cawnpore
of
havelock
on
and
men
alike
urged
on
by
the
hope
of
rescuing
the
women
and
the
events
which
the
whole
history
of
chivalry
can
not
equal
outram
s
conduct
to
havelock
in
resigning
to
him
though
his
inferior
officer
the
honour
of
leading
the
attack
on
lucknow
was
a
trait
worthy
of
sydney
and
alone
justifies
the
title
which
has
been
awarded
to
him
of
the
bayard
of
the
death
of
henry
brave
and
gentle
last
words
before
dying
let
there
be
no
fuss
about
me
let
me
be
buried
the
anxious
solicitude
of
sir
colin
campbell
to
rescue
the
beleaguered
of
lucknow
and
to
conduct
his
long
train
of
women
and
children
by
night
from
thence
to
cawnpore
which
he
reached
amidst
the
all
but
overpowering
assault
of
the
enemy

with
which
he
led
them
across
the
perilous
bridge
never
ceasing
his
charge
over
them
until
he
had
seen
the
precious
convoy
safe
on
the
road
to
allahabad
and
then
burst
upon
the
gwalior
contingent
like
a
things
make
us
feel
proud
of
our
countrymen
and
inspire
the
conviction
that
the
best
and
purest
glow
of
chivalry
is
not
dead
but
vigorously
lives
among
us
yet
even
the

gentlemen
under
their
trials
at

where
so
many
poor
fellows
had
been
scorched
and
wounded
in
their
encounter
with
the
enemy
they
were
brought
into
the
fort
and
tenderly

by
the

and
the
rough
gallant
fellows
proved
gentle
as
any

during

that
the

watched
over

never

by

of

to
an
entertainment
in

where
amidst
flowers
and
music
the
rough
veterans
all
scarred
and
mutilated
as

were
stood
up
to
thank
their

the
wreck
of
the
off
the
coast
of
africa
on
the
of
february
affords
another
memorable
illustration
of
the
chivalrous
spirit
of
common
men
acting
in
this
nineteenth
century
of
which
any
age
might
be
proud
the
vessel
was
steaming
along
the
african
coast
with
men
and
women
and
children
on
board
the
men
belonged
to
several
regiments
then
serving
at
the
cape
and
consisted
principally
of
recruits
who
had
been
only
a
short
time
in
the
service
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
while
all
were
asleep
below
the
ship
struck
with
violence
upon
a
hidden
rock
which
penetrated
her
bottom
and
it
was
at
once
felt
that
she
must
go
down
the
roll
of
the
drums
called
the
soldiers
to
arms
on
the
upper
deck
and
the
men
mustered
as
if
on
parade
the
word
was
passed
to
the
women
and
and
the
helpless
creatures
were
brought
from
below
mostly
undressed
and
handed
silently
into
the
boats
when
they
had
all
left
the
ship
s
side
the
commander
of
the
vessel
thoughtlessly
called
out
all
those
that
can
swim
jump
overboard
and
make
for
the
but
captain
wright
of
the
highlanders
said
no
if
you
do
that
boats
with
the
women
must
be
and
the
brave
men
stood
motionless
there
was
no
boat
remaining
and
no
hope
of
safety
but
not
a
heart
quailed
no
one
flinched
from
his
duty
in
that
trying
moment
there
was
not
a
murmur
nor
a
cry
amongst
them
said
captain
wright
a
survivor
until
the
vessel
made
her
final
down
went
the
ship
and
down
went
the
heroic
band
firing
a
de
as
they
sank
beneath
the
waves
glory
and
honour
to
the
gentle
and
the
brave
the
examples
of
such
men
never
die
but
like
their
memories
are
immortal
there
are
many
tests
by
which
a
gentleman
may
be
known
but
there
is
one
that
never
does
he
over
those
subordinate
to
him
how
does
he
conduct
himself
towards
women
and
children
how
does
the
officer
treat
his
men
the
employer
his
servants
the
master
his
pupils
and
man
in
every
station
those
who
are
weaker
than
himself
the
discretion
forbearance
and
kindliness
with
which
power
in
such
cases
is
used
may
indeed
be
regarded
as
the
crucial
test
of
gentlemanly
character
when
la
motte
was
one
day
passing
through
a
crowd
he
accidentally
trod
upon
the
foot
of
a
young
fellow
who
forthwith
struck
him
on
the
face
ah
sire
said
la
motte
you
will
surely
be
sorry
for
what
you
have
done
when
you
know
that
am
he
who
bullies
those
who
are
not
in
a
position
to
resist
may
be
a
snob
but
can
not
be
a
gentleman
he
who
tyrannizes
over
the
weak
and
helpless
may
be
a
coward
but
no
true
man
the
tyrant
it
has
been
said
is
but
a
slave
turned
inside
out
strength
and
the
consciousness
of
strength
in
a
man
imparts
a
nobleness
to
his
character
but
he
will
be
most
careful
how
he
uses
it
for
it
is
excellent
to
have
a
giant
s
strength
but
it
is
tyrannous
to
use
it
like
a
gentleness
is
indeed
the
best
test
of
gentlemanliness
a
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
for
his
inferiors
and
dependants
as
well
as
his
equals
and
respect
for
their
will
pervade
the
true
gentleman
s
whole
conduct
he
will
rather
himself
suffer
a
small
injury
than
by
an
uncharitable
construction
of
another
s
behaviour
incur
the
risk
of
committing
a
great
wrong
he
will
be
forbearant
of
the
weaknesses
the
failings
and
the
errors
of
those
whose
advantages
in
life
have
not
been
equal
to
his
own
he
will
be
merciful
even
to
his
beast
he
will
not
boast
of
his
wealth
or
his
strength
or
his
gifts
he
will
not
be
puffed
up
by
success
or
unduly
depressed
by
failure
he
will
not
obtrude
his
views
on
others
but
speak
his
mind
freely
when
occasion
calls
for
it
he
will
not
confer
favours
with
a
patronizing
air

in

spirit

of

that
when

wounded

is
to
the
