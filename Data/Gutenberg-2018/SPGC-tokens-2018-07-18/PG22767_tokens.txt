chapter
one
the
girl
came
toward
him
across
the
silent
room
she
was
young
she
was
beautiful
her
red
hair
curled
like
a
flame
round
her
eager
face
her
arms
reached
for
him
her
hands
touched
him
her
eyes
were
alive
with
the
light
of
pure
love
i
am
yours
the
eyes
kept
saying
do
with
me
as
you
will
forrester
watched
the
eyes
with
a
kind
of
fascination
now
the
girl
mouth
opened
the
lips
parted
slightly
and
her
husky
voice
murmured
softly
take
me
take
me
forrester
blinked
and
stepped
back
my
god
he
said
this
is
ridiculous
the
girl
pressed
herself
against
him
the
sensation
was
forrester
thought
with
a
kind
of
awe
undeniably
pleasant
he
tried
to
remember
the
girl
name
and
could
she
wriggled
slightly
and
her
arms
went
up
around
him
her
hands
clasped
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
her
mouth
moved
close
to
his
ear
please
she
whispered
i
want
you
forrester
felt
his
head
swimming
he
opened
his
mouth
but
nothing
whatever
came
out
he
shut
his
mouth
and
tried
to
think
what
to
do
with
his
hands
they
were
hanging
foolishly
at
his
sides
the
girl
came
even
closer
something
forrester
would
have
thought
impossible
time
stopped
forrester
swam
in
a
pink
haze
of
sensations
only
one
small
corner
of
his
brain
refused
to
lose
itself
in
the
magnificence
of
the
moment
in
that
corner
forrester
felt
feverishly
uncomfortable
he
tried
again
to
remember
the
girl
name
and
failed
again
of
course
there
was
really
no
reason
why
he
should
have
known
the
name
it
was
after
all
only
the
first
day
of
class
please
he
said
valiantly
miss
he
stopped
i
maya
wilson
the
girl
said
in
his
ear
i
in
your
class
forrester
introductory
world
history
she
bit
his
ear
gently
forrester
jumped
none
of
the
textbooks
of
propriety
he
had
ever
seen
seemed
to
cover
the
situation
he
found
himself
in
what
did
one
do
when
assaulted
pleasantly
to
be
sure
but
assault
was
assault
by
a
lovely
girl
who
happened
to
be
one
of
your
freshman
students
she
had
called
him
forrester
that
was
right
and
proper
even
if
it
was
a
little
silly
but
what
should
he
call
her
miss
wilson
that
did
sound
right
at
all
but
for
other
reasons
maya
sounded
even
worse
the
girl
said
please
and
added
to
the
force
of
the
word
with
another
little
wriggle
against
forrester
it
solved
his
problems
there
was
now
only
one
thing
to
do
and
he
did
it
he
broke
away
found
himself
on
the
other
side
of
his
desk
looking
across
at
an
eager
freshman
student
well
he
said
there
was
a
lone
little
bead
of
sweat
trickling
down
his
forehead
across
his
frontal
ridge
and
down
one
cheek
he
ignored
it
bravely
trying
to
think
what
to
do
next
well
he
repeated
at
last
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
gentle
and
fatherly
tone
well
well
well
well
well
it
did
seem
to
have
any
effect
perhaps
he
thought
an
attempt
to
put
things
back
on
the
level
might
have
better
results
you
wanted
me
to
see
you
he
said
in
a
grave
scholarly
tone
then
gulping
briefly
he
amended
it
in
a
voice
that
had
suddenly
grown
an
octave
you
wanted
to
see
me
i
mean
you
oh
maya
wilson
said
oh
my
goodness
mr
forrester
she
made
a
sudden
sensuous
motion
that
looked
to
forrester
as
if
she
had
suddenly
abolished
bones
but
it
was
unpleasant
far
from
it
quite
the
contrary
forrester
licked
his
lips
which
were
suddenly
very
dry
well
he
said
what
about
miss
uh
miss
wilson
please
call
me
maya
forrester
and
i
call
you
there
was
a
second
of
hesitation
forrester
maya
said
plaintively
what
is
your
first
name
first
name
forrester
tried
to
think
of
his
first
name
you
want
to
know
my
first
name
well
maya
said
i
want
to
call
you
something
because
after
all
she
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
leap
over
the
desk
you
may
call
me
forrester
said
grasping
at
his
sanity
mr
forrester
maya
sidled
around
the
desk
quietly
forrester
she
said
reaching
for
him
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
the
introductory
world
history
course
forrester
shivered
as
if
someone
had
thrown
cold
water
on
his
rising
aspirations
oh
he
said
that
right
maya
whispered
her
mouth
was
close
to
his
ear
again
other
parts
of
her
were
close
to
other
parts
of
him
once
more
forrester
found
it
difficult
to
concentrate
i
to
pass
the
course
forrester
maya
whispered
just
to
somehow
forrester
retained
just
enough
control
of
his
faculties
to
remember
the
standard
answer
to
protestations
like
that
one
well
sure
you
will
he
said
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
calm
hearty
hopeful
voice
he
was
reasonably
sure
it
was
any
of
those
and
even
surer
that
it
was
all
three
you
seem
like
a
like
a
fairly
intelligent
young
lady
he
finished
lamely
oh
no
she
said
i
sure
i
wo
be
able
to
remember
all
those
dates
and
things
never
never
suddenly
she
pressed
herself
wildly
against
him
throwing
him
slightly
off
balance
locked
together
the
couple
reeled
against
the
desk
forrester
felt
it
digging
into
the
small
of
his
back
i
do
anything
to
pass
the
course
mr
forrester
she
vowed
anything
the
insistent
pressure
of
the
desk
top
robbed
the
moment
of
some
of
its
natural
splendor
forrester
disengaged
himself
gently
and
slid
a
little
out
of
the
way
now
now
he
said
moving
rapidly
across
the
room
toward
a
blank
wall
this
sort
of
thing
is
usually
done
maya
i
mean
miss
wilson
i
mean
but
people
just
do
do
such
things
forrester
said
sternly
he
thought
of
escaping
through
the
door
but
the
picture
that
arose
immediately
in
his
mind
dissuaded
him
he
saw
maya
pursuing
him
passionately
through
the
halls
while
admiring
students
and
faculty
stared
after
them
anyhow
he
added
as
an
afterthought
not
at
the
of
the
semester
oh
maya
said
she
was
advancing
on
him
slowly
you
mean
i
ought
to
see
if
i
can
pass
the
course
on
my
own
first
and
not
at
all
forrester
cut
in
maya
sniffed
sadly
oh
you
just
do
understand
she
said
an
athenian
are
you
athenan
forrester
said
automatically
it
was
a
correction
he
found
himself
called
upon
to
make
ten
or
twelve
times
a
week
an
athenian
is
a
resident
of
athens
while
an
athenan
is
a
worshipper
of
the
goddess
athena
we
i
understand
maya
said
i
suppose
it
like
us
we
do
like
to
be
called
aphrodisiacs
you
know
we
prefer
venerans
she
was
leaning
across
the
desk
forrester
though
he
supposed
some
people
might
be
fussy
about
it
could
see
no
objection
whatever
to
the
term
aphrodisiacs
a
wild
thought
dealing
with
spheres
of
influence
strayed
into
his
mind
and
he
suppressed
it
firmly
the
girl
was
a
veneran
a
worshipper
of
venus
goddess
of
love
her
choice
of
religion
he
thought
was
unusually
appropriate
and
as
for
his
chapter
two
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
only
an
hour
or
so
before
he
had
been
peaceful
and
calm
entirely
occupied
with
his
duties
in
the
great
temple
of
pallas
athena
his
mind
gave
a
sudden
leap
and
he
was
back
there
again
standing
at
the
rear
of
the
vast
room
and
focusing
all
of
his
strained
attention
on
it
the
glowing
embers
in
the
golden
incense
tripods
were
dying
now
but
the
heavy
clouds
of
frankincense
still
tingled
with
the
sweet
aroma
of
balsam
and
clove
hung
heavily
in
the
quiet
air
over
the
main
altar
in
the
flickering
illumination
of
the
gas
sconces
around
the
walls
the
figures
on
the
great
tapestries
seemed
to
move
with
a
subtle
life
of
their
own
even
though
the
great
brazen
gong
had
sounded
for
the
last
time
twenty
minutes
before
marking
the
end
of
the
service
there
were
still
a
few
worshippers
in
the
pews
seated
with
heads
bowed
in
prayer
to
the
goddess
forrester
considered
them
carefully
people
a
sprinkling
of
youngsters
and
in
the
far
corner
a
girl
who
looked
just
a
little
like
forrester
peered
more
closely
it
was
just
a
slight
resemblance
the
girl
really
seemed
to
be
gerda
symes
her
long
blonde
hair
shone
in
the
dimness
forrester
could
see
her
very
clearly
but
his
imagination
was
working
overtime
her
magnificently
curved
figure
her
wonderful
face
her
fiery
personality
were
as
much
a
part
of
his
dreams
as
the
bed
he
slept
on
if
not
for
her
brother
forrester
sighed
and
forced
himself
to
return
his
attention
to
his
duties
his
hands
remained
clasped
reverently
at
his
breast
whatever
battle
went
on
in
his
mind
the
remaining
few
people
in
the
great
room
would
see
nothing
but
what
was
fitting
at
any
rate
he
told
himself
he
made
rather
an
imposing
sight
in
his
robes
and
with
a
stirring
of
vanity
which
he
prayed
athena
to
chasten
he
was
rather
proud
of
it
he
was
a
fairly
tall
man
just
a
shade
under
six
feet
but
his
slight
paunch
made
him
seem
shorter
than
he
was
his
face
was
round
and
smooth
and
pleasant
and
that
made
him
look
younger
than
he
was
instead
of
as
befitted
an
acolyte
of
the
goddess
of
wisdom
his
dark
curly
hair
was
cut
rather
long
when
he
bowed
to
a
departing
worshipper
lowering
his
head
in
graceful
acknowledgment
of
their
deferential
nods
he
felt
that
he
made
a
striking
and
commanding
picture
though
of
course
the
worshippers
were
doing
him
any
honor
that
bow
was
not
for
him
but
directed
toward
the
owl
the
symbol
of
the
goddess
embroidered
on
the
breast
of
the
white
tunic
as
an
acolyte
after
all
he
rated
just
barely
above
a
layman
he
had
no
powers
whatever
athena
knew
that
naturally
but
somehow
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
get
it
through
his
own
doubtless
skull
he
often
dreamed
of
power
being
a
priest
or
a
priestess
for
instance
now
that
meant
something
at
least
people
paid
attention
to
you
if
you
were
a
member
of
the
hierarchy
favored
of
the
gods
but
forrester
knew
there
was
no
chance
of
that
any
more
either
you
were
picked
before
you
were
or
you
were
picked
at
all
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
in
spite
of
his
looks
forrester
was
six
years
past
the
limit
and
so
he
become
an
acolyte
sometimes
he
wondered
how
much
of
that
had
been
an
honest
desire
to
serve
athena
and
how
much
a
sop
to
his
worldly
vanity
certainly
a
college
history
instructor
had
enough
to
do
without
adding
the
unpaid
religious
services
of
an
acolyte
to
his
work
but
these
were
thoughts
unworthy
of
his
position
they
reminded
him
of
his
own
childhood
when
he
had
dreamed
of
becoming
one
of
the
lesser
gods
or
even
zeus
himself
zeus
had
provided
the
best
answer
to
those
dreams
forrester
knew
now
i
am
a
man
zeus
had
said
and
i
put
away
childish
things
well
forrester
considered
it
behooved
him
to
put
away
childish
things
too
a
mere
vanity
a
mere
love
of
spectacle
was
unworthy
of
the
goddess
he
served
and
his
costume
and
bearing
certainly
had
got
him
very
far
with
gerda
he
tore
his
eyes
away
from
her
again
and
sighed
before
he
could
bring
his
mind
back
to
athena
there
was
an
interruption
another
acolyte
moved
out
of
the
shadows
to
his
right
and
came
softly
toward
him
forrester
he
whispered
forrester
turned
recognizing
young
bates
a
chinless
boy
of
perhaps
with
the
wide
innocent
eyes
of
the
born
fanatic
but
it
did
become
a
servant
of
athena
to
think
ill
of
her
other
servants
forrester
reminded
himself
brushing
the
possibility
of
a
rude
reply
from
his
mind
forrester
said
simply
yes
what
is
it
there
a
couple
of
temple
myrmidons
to
see
you
outside
bates
whispered
i
take
over
your
post
forrester
responded
with
no
more
than
a
simple
nod
as
if
the
occurrence
were
one
that
happened
every
day
but
it
was
not
only
the
thought
of
leaving
gerda
that
moved
him
as
he
turned
and
strode
to
the
small
door
that
led
to
the
side
room
off
the
main
auditorium
he
was
thinking
furiously
under
his
calm
exterior
temple
myrmidons
what
could
they
want
with
him
as
an
acolyte
he
was
at
least
immune
to
arrest
by
the
civil
police
and
even
the
temple
myrmidons
had
no
right
to
take
him
into
custody
without
a
warrant
from
the
pontifex
himself
but
such
a
warrant
was
a
serious
affair
what
had
he
done
wrong
he
tried
to
think
of
some
cause
for
an
arrest
blasphemy
sacrilege
but
he
found
nothing
except
his
interior
thoughts
and
those
he
told
himself
with
a
blaze
of
anger
fierce
enough
to
surprise
him
were
nobody
business
but
his
own
and
athena
authorities
either
less
personal
or
more
temporal
had
no
business
dealing
with
thoughts
beyond
those
there
was
a
thing
no
irreverence
toward
any
of
the
gods
in
his
private
life
his
religious
functions
or
his
teaching
position
at
least
as
far
as
he
could
recall
the
gods
knew
that
unorthodoxy
in
an
introductory
history
course
for
instance
was
not
only
unwise
but
damned
difficult
of
course
he
was
aware
of
the
real
position
of
the
gods
they
omnipotent
their
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
was
high
but
they
were
certainly
not
equal
with
the
one
who
had
created
the
universe
and
the
gods
themselves
in
the
first
place
possibly
forrester
had
always
thought
they
could
be
equated
with
the
indefinite
angels
of
the
religions
that
had
been
popular
during
his
grandfather
time
sixty
years
ago
before
the
return
of
the
gods
but
that
was
an
uncertain
theological
notion
and
forrester
was
quite
ready
to
abandon
it
in
the
face
of
good
argument
to
the
contrary
whatever
they
were
the
gods
were
certainly
the
gods
of
earth
now
the
omnipotent
creator
had
evidently
left
it
for
them
to
run
while
he
went
about
his
own
mysterious
business
far
from
the
understanding
or
the
lives
of
men
the
gods
omnipotent
or
not
ran
the
world
and
everything
in
it
and
if
like
forrester
you
knew
that
omnipotence
was
their
strong
point
you
just
did
mention
it
it
would
have
been
impolite
to
have
done
so
like
talking
about
sight
to
a
blind
man
and
impolite
was
not
the
only
word
that
covered
the
case
the
gods
had
enough
power
as
everyone
knew
to
avenge
any
blasphemies
against
them
and
careless
mention
of
limitations
on
their
power
would
surely
be
construed
as
blasphemy
true
or
not
forrester
had
never
even
thought
of
doing
such
a
thing
so
what
he
thought
did
the
temple
myrmidons
want
with
him
he
came
to
the
anteroom
and
went
in
seeing
the
two
of
them
at
once
they
were
big
burly
chaps
with
hard
faces
and
the
pistols
that
were
holstered
at
their
sides
looked
completely
unnecessary
forrester
took
a
deep
breath
and
went
a
step
forward
there
he
stopped
staring
the
myrmidons
were
strangers
to
him
and
now
he
understood
why
neither
was
wearing
the
owl
of
both
proudly
sported
the
thunderbolt
of
the
himself
it
forrester
told
himself
with
a
sinking
sensation
one
of
the
myrmidons
looked
him
up
and
down
in
a
casual
way
you
william
forrester
that
right
forrester
said
knowing
that
he
looked
quite
calm
and
wondering
at
the
same
time
whether
or
not
he
would
live
out
the
next
few
minutes
the
myrmidons
of
did
come
around
to
other
temples
on
unimportant
errands
may
i
help
you
he
went
on
feeling
foolish
let
see
your
id
card
please
the
myrmidon
said
in
the
same
tone
as
before
that
puzzled
forrester
he
doubted
whether
examination
of
credentials
was
a
part
of
the
routine
preceding
arrest
or
execution
for
that
matter
the
usual
procedure
was
and
probably
always
had
been
to
act
first
and
apologize
later
if
at
all
maybe
whatever
he
done
had
been
so
important
they
could
afford
to
make
mistakes
but
did
the
myrmidon
really
think
that
an
imposter
could
parade
around
in
an
acolyte
tunic
in
the
very
temple
of
pallas
athena
without
being
caught
by
one
of
the
athenan
myrmidons
or
some
other
acolyte
or
priest
maybe
a
thing
like
that
could
happen
in
one
of
the
other
temples
forrester
thought
but
here
at
pallas
athena
people
took
the
attribute
of
wisdom
seriously
what
the
dionysians
might
do
he
reflected
was
impossible
to
say
or
for
that
matter
the
venerans
but
he
produced
his
identity
card
and
handed
it
to
the
myrmidon
it
was
compared
with
a
card
the
myrmidon
dug
out
of
his
pouch
and
the
thumbprints
on
both
cards
were
examined
side
by
side
after
a
while
forrester
got
his
card
back
the
myrmidon
said
we
and
began
to
cough
his
companion
came
over
to
slap
him
on
the
back
with
blows
forrester
watched
without
changing
expression
some
seconds
passed
then
the
myrmidon
choked
swallowed
straightened
and
said
his
face
purple
all
this
incense
not
like
what
we
got
over
at
the
temple
enough
to
choke
a
man
to
death
forrester
murmured
politely
back
to
business
right
he
favored
forrester
with
a
rather
smile
and
forrester
allowed
his
own
lips
to
curve
gently
and
respectfully
upward
it
did
look
as
if
he
going
to
be
killed
after
all
important
instructions
for
you
the
myrmidon
said
from
the
pontifex
maximus
and
not
to
be
repeated
to
any
mortal
understand
forrester
nodded
and
that
means
mortal
the
myrmidon
said
girl
friend
wife
or
do
you
athenans
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
now
up
at
the
temple
we
his
companion
gave
him
a
sharp
dig
in
the
ribs
oh
the
myrmidon
said
sure
well
instructions
not
to
be
repeated
right
right
forrester
said
instructions
from
the
pontifex
maximus
instructions
forrester
mind
spun
dizzily
this
was
no
arrest
this
was
something
very
special
and
unique
he
tried
once
more
to
imagine
what
it
was
going
to
be
and
gave
it
up
in
wonder
the
myrmidon
produced
another
card
from
his
pouch
there
was
nothing
on
it
but
the
golden
thunderbolt
of
the
but
that
was
quite
enough
forrester
accepted
the
card
dumbly
you
will
report
to
the
tower
of
zeus
at
eighteen
hundred
hours
exactly
the
myrmidon
said
got
that
you
mean
today
forrester
said
and
cursed
himself
for
sounding
stupid
but
the
myrmidon
appeared
not
to
have
noticed
today
sure
he
said
eighteen
hundred
just
present
this
card
he
stepped
back
obviously
getting
ready
to
leave
forrester
watched
him
for
one
long
second
and
then
burst
out
what
do
i
do
after
that
just
be
a
good
boy
do
what
you
told
ask
no
questions
it
better
that
way
forrester
thought
of
six
separate
replies
and
settled
on
a
seventh
all
right
he
said
and
remember
the
myrmidon
said
at
the
outside
door
do
mention
this
to
anyone
anyone
the
door
banged
shut
forrester
found
himself
staring
at
the
card
he
held
he
put
it
away
in
his
case
alongside
the
id
card
then
dazed
he
went
on
back
to
the
acolyte
sacristy
took
off
his
white
tunic
and
put
on
his
street
clothes
what
did
they
want
with
him
at
the
tower
of
zeus
it
did
really
sound
like
an
arrest
if
it
had
been
that
the
myrmidons
themselves
would
have
taken
him
so
what
did
the
pontifex
maximus
want
with
william
forrester
he
spent
some
time
considering
it
and
then
taking
a
deep
breath
he
forced
it
out
of
his
mind
he
would
know
at
eighteen
hundred
and
such
were
the
ways
of
the
gods
that
he
would
not
know
one
second
before
so
there
was
no
point
in
worrying
about
it
he
told
himself
he
almost
made
himself
believe
it
but
wiping
speculation
out
of
his
mind
left
an
unwelcome
and
uneasy
vacancy
forrester
replaced
it
with
thought
of
the
morning
service
in
the
temple
such
devotion
was
probably
valuable
anyhow
in
a
spiritual
sense
it
brought
him
closer
to
the
gods
the
gods
he
wanted
desperately
to
be
like
that
he
told
himself
sharply
was
foolishness
of
the
most
senseless
kind
he
blinked
it
away
the
goddess
athena
had
appeared
herself
at
the
service
sufficient
reason
for
thinking
of
it
now
the
statuesquely
beautiful
goddess
with
her
severely
blonde
hair
and
her
deep
gray
eyes
was
the
embodiment
of
the
wisdom
and
strength
for
which
her
worshippers
especially
prayed
her
beauty
was
almost
unworldly
impossible
of
existence
in
a
world
which
contained
mortals
she
reminded
forrester
ever
so
slightly
and
of
course
in
a
reverent
way
of
gerda
symes
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
many
forbidden
thoughts
floating
around
this
day
resolutely
forrester
went
back
to
thinking
about
the
service
the
goddess
had
appeared
only
long
enough
to
impart
her
blessing
but
her
calm
beautifully
controlled
contralto
voice
had
brought
a
sense
of
peace
to
everyone
in
the
auditorium
to
be
doggedly
practical
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
goddess
presence
was
an
appearance
in
person
or
an
appearance
by
divine
vision
but
that
really
matter
the
effect
was
always
just
the
same
forrester
went
on
out
the
front
portals
of
the
temple
of
wisdom
and
down
the
long
wide
steps
onto
fifth
avenue
he
paid
homage
with
a
passing
glance
to
the
great
owls
flanking
the
entrance
symbolic
of
athena
they
had
replaced
the
stone
lions
which
had
formerly
stood
there
the
street
was
busy
with
hurrying
crowds
enlivened
here
and
there
by
temple
myrmidons
from
the
from
bacchus
from
venus
even
one
from
pallas
athena
herself
a
swaggerer
whom
forrester
knew
and
disliked
the
man
came
striding
up
the
steps
greeted
forrester
with
a
bare
nod
and
disappeared
at
top
speed
into
the
temple
forrester
sighed
and
glanced
south
down
toward
street
where
the
huge
tower
of
zeus
a
hundred
and
four
stories
high
loomed
over
all
the
other
buildings
in
the
city
at
eighteen
hundred
he
would
be
in
that
tower
for
what
purpose
he
had
no
idea
well
that
was
in
the
future
and
he
a
voice
said
well
hello
bill
forrester
turned
knowing
exactly
what
to
expect
and
disliking
it
in
advance
the
bluff
of
the
voice
was
matched
by
the
gross
and
hairy
figure
that
confronted
him
in
some
disarray
and
managing
to
look
as
if
he
needed
simultaneously
a
bath
a
shave
a
disinfecting
and
a
purgative
the
figure
approached
forrester
with
a
rolling
walk
that
was
too
for
anything
except
an
elephant
how
the
today
said
the
voice
and
the
body
stuck
out
a
flabby
hairy
white
hand
forrester
winced
i
fine
he
said
evenly
and
how
the
winebibber
good
for
you
the
figure
said
a
little
wine
for
your
stomach
sake
as
good
old
bacchus
always
says
only
we
make
it
a
lot
eh
he
winked
and
nudged
forrester
in
the
ribs
sure
sure
forrester
said
he
wished
desperately
that
he
could
take
the
gross
fool
and
tear
him
into
tastefully
arranged
pieces
but
there
was
always
gerda
and
since
this
particular
idiot
happened
to
be
her
younger
brother
ed
symes
anything
in
the
nature
of
violence
was
unthinkable
gerda
opinion
of
her
brother
was
touching
reverent
and
forrester
thought
savagely
not
in
the
least
borne
out
by
any
discoverable
facts
and
a
worshipper
of
bacchus
not
that
forrester
had
anything
against
the
orgiastic
rites
indulged
in
by
the
dionysians
the
panites
the
apollones
or
even
the
worst
and
wildest
of
them
all
the
venerans
if
that
was
how
the
gods
wanted
to
be
worshipped
then
that
was
how
they
should
be
worshipped
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
sounded
like
fun
if
forrester
considered
entirely
too
public
for
his
taste
if
he
preferred
the
quieter
rites
of
athena
or
of
juno
diana
or
ceres
and
even
ceresians
became
a
little
wild
during
the
spring
fertility
rites
especially
in
the
country
where
the
farmers
depended
on
her
for
successful
crops
well
that
was
no
more
than
a
personal
preference
but
the
idea
of
ed
symes
involved
in
a
bacchic
orgy
was
just
a
little
too
much
for
the
normal
mind
or
the
normal
stomach
hey
ed
said
suddenly
where
gerda
still
in
the
temple
i
did
see
her
forrester
said
there
been
a
woman
looked
like
her
but
that
had
been
gerda
have
waited
for
him
here
and
funny
ed
said
why
forrester
said
i
did
see
her
i
do
think
she
attended
the
service
this
morning
that
all
he
wanted
very
badly
to
hit
symes
just
once
but
he
knew
he
could
first
of
all
there
was
gerda
and
then
as
an
acolyte
he
was
proscribed
by
law
from
brawling
no
one
would
hit
an
acolyte
and
if
the
acolyte
were
built
like
forrester
striking
another
man
might
be
the
equivalent
of
murder
one
good
blow
from
forrester
fist
might
break
the
average
man
jaw
that
was
he
discovered
a
surprisingly
pleasant
thought
but
he
made
himself
keep
still
as
the
fat
fool
went
on
funny
she
did
attend
symes
said
but
maybe
she
gotten
wise
to
herself
there
was
a
celebration
up
at
the
temple
of
pan
in
central
park
starting
at
midnight
and
going
on
through
the
morning
spring
rites
maybe
she
went
there
i
doubt
it
forrester
said
instantly
that
hardly
her
type
of
worship
is
it
symes
said
it
does
fit
her
that
kind
of
i
know
gerda
like
you
a
little
stuffy
it
not
being
stuffy
forrester
started
to
explain
it
sure
symes
said
only
she
not
as
much
of
a
prude
as
you
are
i
could
stand
her
if
she
were
on
the
other
hand
she
not
a
not
an
of
like
you
not
a
drunken
blockhead
forrester
finished
triumphantly
at
least
she
got
a
decent
respect
for
wisdom
and
learning
symes
stepped
back
a
movement
for
which
forrester
felt
grateful
no
matter
how
far
away
ed
symes
was
he
was
still
too
close
who
you
calling
a
blockhead
buster
symes
said
his
eyes
narrowed
to
piggish
little
slits
forrester
took
a
deep
breath
and
reminded
himself
not
to
hit
the
other
man
you
he
said
almost
mildly
if
brains
were
radium
you
make
a
flicker
on
a
scintillation
counter
it
was
just
a
little
doubtful
that
symes
understood
the
insult
but
he
obviously
knew
it
had
been
one
his
face
changed
color
to
a
kind
of
grayish
purple
and
his
hands
clenched
slowly
at
his
sides
forrester
stood
watching
him
quietly
symes
made
a
sound
like
and
took
a
breath
if
you
were
an
acolyte
i
take
a
poke
at
you
just
to
see
you
bounce
sure
you
would
forrester
agreed
politely
symes
went
again
and
there
was
a
longer
silence
then
he
said
not
that
i
hit
you
anyhow
buster
it
go
against
my
grain
not
the
acolyte
business
if
you
did
look
so
much
like
bacchus
i
take
the
chance
forrester
jaw
ached
in
a
second
he
realized
why
he
was
clenching
his
teeth
tightly
perhaps
it
was
true
that
he
did
look
a
little
like
bacchus
but
not
enough
for
ed
symes
to
kid
about
it
symes
grinned
at
him
symes
undoubtedly
thought
the
grin
gave
him
a
pleasant
and
carefree
expression
it
did
suppose
i
go
have
a
look
for
gerda
myself
he
said
casually
heading
up
the
stairs
toward
the
temple
entrance
after
all
you
so
busy
looking
at
books
you
might
have
missed
her
and
what
forrester
asked
himself
was
the
answer
to
that
except
a
punch
in
the
mouth
it
really
did
matter
anyhow
symes
was
on
his
way
into
the
temple
and
forrester
could
just
ignore
him
but
damn
it
why
did
he
let
the
young
idiot
get
his
goat
that
way
did
he
have
enough
just
to
ignore
symes
and
his
oafish
insults
forrester
supposed
sadly
that
he
did
oh
well
it
just
made
another
quality
he
had
to
pray
to
athena
for
then
he
glanced
at
his
wristwatch
and
stopped
thinking
about
symes
entirely
it
was
he
had
to
be
at
work
at
thirteen
hundred
still
angry
underneath
the
sudden
need
for
speed
he
turned
and
sprinted
toward
the
subway
and
thus
forrester
said
tiredly
having
attempted
to
make
himself
the
equal
of
the
gods
man
was
given
a
punishment
befitting
such
arrogance
he
paused
and
took
a
breath
surveying
the
students
in
the
classroom
and
some
he
told
himself
wryly
odd
with
a
sort
of
benign
boredom
history
i
introductory
survey
of
world
history
was
a
simple
enough
course
to
teach
but
its
very
simplicity
was
its
undoing
forrester
thought
the
deadly
dullness
of
the
routine
was
enough
to
wear
out
the
strongest
soul
freshmen
too
seemed
to
get
stupider
every
year
certainly
when
been
seventeen
he
been
different
altogether
studious
earnest
questioning
then
he
stopped
himself
and
grinned
he
probably
seemed
even
worse
to
his
own
instructors
where
had
he
been
slowly
he
picked
up
the
thread
there
was
a
young
blonde
girl
watching
him
eagerly
from
a
front
seat
what
was
her
name
forrester
tried
to
recall
it
and
could
well
this
was
only
the
first
day
of
term
he
get
to
know
them
all
soon
enough
well
enough
anyhow
to
dislike
most
of
them
but
the
eager
expression
on
the
girl
face
unnerved
him
a
little
the
rest
of
the
class
was
paying
anything
like
such
strict
attention
as
a
matter
of
fact
forrester
suspected
two
young
boys
in
the
back
of
being
in
a
trance
well
he
could
stop
that
but
she
was
really
quite
attractive
forrester
told
himself
of
course
she
was
nothing
but
a
fresh
pretty
eager
with
a
figure
that
she
was
forrester
reminded
himself
sternly
a
student
and
he
was
supposed
to
be
an
instructor
he
cleared
his
throat
man
went
with
his
freedom
from
divine
guidance
he
said
woman
did
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
now
what
unholy
devil
had
made
him
say
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
normal
lecture
for
first
day
of
the
new
term
it
was
well
it
was
just
a
little
risqué
for
students
some
of
their
parents
might
complain
and
but
the
girl
in
the
front
row
was
smiling
appreciatively
wonder
what
she
doing
in
an
introductory
forrester
thought
leaping
with
no
evidence
at
all
to
the
conclusion
that
the
girl
mind
was
much
too
fine
and
educated
to
be
subjected
to
the
general
run
of
classes
he
began
and
then
cut
himself
off
sharply
found
his
place
in
the
lecture
again
and
went
on
when
the
gods
decided
to
sit
back
and
observe
for
a
few
thousand
years
they
allowed
man
to
go
his
merry
way
just
to
teach
him
a
lesson
the
boys
in
the
back
of
the
room
were
definitely
in
a
trance
forrester
sighed
and
the
inevitable
happened
he
said
from
the
eighth
century
old
style
until
the
year
old
style
man
lot
went
from
bad
to
worse
without
the
gods
to
guide
him
he
bred
bigger
and
bigger
wars
and
greater
and
greater
empires
beginning
with
the
conquests
of
the
mad
alexander
of
macedonia
and
culminating
in
the
opposing
soviet
and
american
spheres
of
influence
during
the
last
century
spheres
of
influence
forrester
gaze
fell
on
the
blonde
girl
again
she
certainly
had
a
figure
and
she
did
seem
so
eager
and
attentive
he
smiled
at
her
tentatively
she
smiled
back
urg
he
said
aloud
the
class
did
seem
to
notice
that
forrester
told
himself
sourly
was
probably
because
they
were
listening
he
swallowed
wrenched
his
gaze
from
the
girl
and
said
the
standoff
for
that
is
what
it
was
would
most
probably
have
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
it
had
no
effect
on
the
class
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
interested
nobody
however
forrester
said
gamely
this
form
of
insanity
was
too
much
for
the
gods
to
allow
they
therefore
the
bell
rang
signifying
the
end
of
the
period
forrester
did
know
whether
to
feel
relieved
or
annoyed
all
right
he
said
that
all
for
today
your
first
assignment
will
be
to
read
and
carefully
study
chapters
one
and
two
of
the
textbook
silence
gave
way
to
a
clatter
of
noise
as
the
students
began
to
file
out
forrester
saw
the
blonde
rise
slowly
and
gracefully
any
doubts
he
might
have
entertained
that
is
he
told
himself
wryly
any
doubts
about
her
figure
were
resolved
magnificently
he
felt
a
little
sweat
on
the
palm
of
his
hands
told
himself
that
he
was
being
silly
and
then
answered
himself
that
the
hell
he
was
the
blonde
gave
him
a
slow
sweet
smile
the
smile
promised
a
good
deal
more
than
forrester
thought
likely
of
fulfillment
he
smiled
back
it
would
have
been
impolite
he
assured
himself
not
to
have
done
so
the
girl
left
the
room
and
a
remaining
crowd
of
students
hurried
out
after
her
the
crowd
included
two
blinking
boys
awakened
by
the
bell
from
what
had
certainly
been
a
trance
forrester
made
a
mental
note
to
inquire
after
their
records
and
to
speak
with
the
boys
himself
when
he
got
the
chance
no
sense
in
disturbing
a
whole
class
to
discipline
them
he
stacked
his
papers
carefully
taking
a
good
long
time
about
it
in
order
to
relax
himself
and
let
his
palms
dry
his
mind
drifted
back
to
the
blonde
and
he
reined
it
in
with
an
effort
and
let
it
go
exploring
again
on
safer
ground
the
class
itself
actually
he
thought
he
rather
liked
teaching
in
spite
of
the
petty
irritations
that
came
from
driving
necessary
knowledge
into
the
heads
of
stubbornly
unwilling
students
it
was
a
satisfying
and
important
job
and
of
course
it
was
an
honor
to
hold
the
position
he
did
ever
since
it
had
been
revealed
that
the
goddess
columbia
was
another
manifestation
of
pallas
athena
herself
the
university
had
grown
tremendously
in
stature
and
after
all
whistling
faintly
behind
his
teeth
forrester
zipped
up
his
filled
briefcase
and
went
out
into
the
hall
he
ignored
the
masses
of
students
swirling
back
and
forth
in
the
corridors
and
finding
a
stairway
went
up
to
his
office
he
fumbled
for
his
key
found
it
and
opened
the
door
then
stepping
in
he
came
to
a
full
stop
the
girl
had
been
waiting
for
him
maya
wilson
and
now
here
she
was
talking
about
the
goddess
of
love
forrester
gulped
anyhow
he
said
at
random
i
an
athenan
he
remembered
that
he
had
already
said
that
did
it
matter
but
what
does
all
this
have
to
do
with
your
passing
or
not
passing
the
course
he
went
on
oh
maya
said
well
i
prayed
to
aphrodite
for
help
in
passing
the
course
and
the
temple
priestess
told
me
i
have
to
make
a
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
in
a
way
a
sacrifice
forrester
gulped
you
mean
not
the
first
sacrifice
she
laughed
that
was
done
with
solemn
ceremonies
when
i
was
seventeen
now
wait
a
minute
please
maya
said
wo
you
listen
to
me
forrester
looked
at
her
limpid
blue
eyes
and
her
lovely
face
sure
sorry
well
then
it
like
this
if
a
person
loves
a
subject
it
that
much
easier
to
understand
it
and
the
goddess
has
promised
me
that
if
i
love
the
instructor
i
love
the
subject
it
like
sympathetic
magic
see
her
explanation
was
so
brisk
and
simple
that
forrester
recoiled
hold
on
he
said
just
hold
your
horses
do
you
mean
you
in
love
with
me
maya
smiled
i
think
so
she
said
and
very
suddenly
she
was
on
forrester
side
of
the
desk
pressing
up
against
him
her
hand
caressed
the
back
of
his
neck
and
her
fingers
tangled
in
his
hair
kiss
me
and
let
find
out
chapter
three
resistance
such
as
it
was
crumbled
in
a
hurry
forrester
complied
with
fervor
an
endless
time
went
by
punctuated
only
by
short
breaths
between
the
kisses
forrester
hands
began
to
rove
so
did
maya
she
began
to
unbutton
his
shirt
not
to
be
outdone
his
own
fingers
got
busy
with
buttons
zippers
hooks
and
the
other
temporary
fastenings
with
which
female
clothing
is
encumbered
he
was
swimming
in
a
red
sea
of
passion
and
the
egyptians
were
nowhere
in
sight
absently
he
got
an
arm
out
of
his
shirt
and
at
the
same
time
somehow
managed
to
undo
the
final
button
of
a
series
maya
blouse
fell
free
forrester
felt
like
stout
cortez
he
pulled
the
girl
to
him
feeling
the
surprisingly
cool
touch
of
her
flesh
against
his
under
the
blouse
and
skirt
he
was
discovering
she
wore
very
little
and
that
was
just
as
well
nagging
thoughts
about
the
doubtful
privacy
of
his
office
were
beginning
to
assail
him
nevertheless
he
persevered
maya
was
as
eager
as
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
being
and
their
embrace
reached
a
height
of
passion
and
began
to
climb
and
climb
to
hitherto
unknown
peaks
of
sensation
forrester
was
busy
for
some
time
discovering
things
he
had
never
known
and
a
lot
of
things
he
had
known
before
but
never
so
well
every
motion
was
met
with
a
reaction
that
was
more
than
equal
and
opposite
every
sensation
unlocked
the
doors
to
whole
galleries
of
new
sensations
higher
and
higher
went
his
emotional
thermometer
higher
and
higher
and
higher
and
higher
and
very
suddenly
he
discovered
how
to
breathe
again
and
it
was
over
my
goodness
maya
said
after
a
brief
resting
spell
i
suppose
i
love
you
for
sure
my
sure
forrester
said
and
now
if
you
pardon
the
indelicacy
and
hand
me
my
pants
he
found
he
was
still
puffing
a
little
and
paused
until
he
could
go
on
i
got
an
appointment
i
simply
ca
afford
to
miss
oh
all
right
maya
said
but
forrester
he
rolled
over
and
looked
at
her
while
he
began
dressing
i
suppose
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
called
me
bill
he
said
carefully
in
class
too
forrester
shook
his
head
no
he
said
not
in
class
but
what
i
wanted
to
ask
yes
forrester
said
bill
do
you
think
i
pass
introductory
world
history
forrester
considered
that
question
there
was
certainly
a
wide
variety
of
answers
he
could
construct
when
he
had
finished
buttoning
his
shirt
he
had
decided
on
one
i
do
see
why
not
he
said
so
long
as
you
complete
your
assignments
regularly
nearly
two
hours
later
feeling
somewhat
but
otherwise
in
perfectly
magnificent
fettle
forrester
found
himself
on
the
downtown
subway
he
showered
and
changed
and
he
was
whistling
a
gay
little
tune
as
he
checked
his
watch
the
time
was
five
minutes
to
five
he
had
just
over
an
hour
before
he
was
due
to
appear
at
the
tower
of
zeus
but
it
was
better
to
be
a
few
minutes
early
than
even
a
single
second
late
the
train
ride
was
a
little
bumpy
but
forrester
did
really
mind
he
was
pretty
well
past
being
irritated
by
anything
nevertheless
he
was
speculating
with
just
a
faint
unease
as
to
what
the
pontifex
maximus
wanted
with
him
what
was
in
store
for
him
at
the
strange
appointment
and
why
all
the
secrecy
his
brooding
was
interrupted
right
away
at
street
a
bearded
old
man
got
on
and
sat
down
next
to
him
he
nudged
forrester
in
the
ribs
and
muttered
look
at
that
now
look
at
that
what
forrester
said
constrained
into
conversation
damn
subways
that
what
the
old
man
said
worse
every
year
bumpier
and
slower
and
worse
just
look
around
look
around
i
would
quite
say
forrester
began
but
the
old
man
gave
him
another
dig
in
the
ribs
and
cut
in
would
say
would
say
he
muttered
listen
man
there
been
an
improvement
in
years
you
realize
that
well
i
no
progress
man
not
in
more
than
half
a
century
listen
when
i
was
a
teen
king
war
councilor
for
the
boppers
i
was
and
let
me
tell
you
that
was
big
time
when
i
was
a
teen
king
we
were
going
places
going
places
for
real
mars
venus
we
were
going
to
have
spaceships
man
forrester
smiled
spasmically
at
the
old
man
i
sure
you
but
what
happened
the
old
man
interrupted
tell
you
what
happened
man
we
never
got
to
mars
and
venus
mars
and
venus
came
to
us
instead
right
along
with
jupiter
and
neptune
and
pluto
and
all
the
rest
of
the
gods
and
we
had
no
progress
ever
since
that
day
no
progress
at
all
and
you
can
believe
it
he
dug
forrester
in
the
ribs
one
final
time
and
sat
back
with
melancholy
satisfaction
well
forrester
said
mildly
what
good
is
progress
the
old
man
he
assured
himself
after
a
moment
reflection
was
actually
saying
anything
blasphemous
after
all
the
gods
did
expect
their
worshippers
to
be
mindless
slaves
somehow
the
notion
made
him
feel
happier
he
have
hated
reporting
the
old
man
something
in
the
outdated
slang
made
him
feel
almost
patriotic
the
old
man
was
a
part
of
america
a
respected
and
important
part
the
respected
part
of
america
made
itself
felt
again
in
ribs
progress
the
old
man
said
what
good
progress
listen
how
can
the
human
race
get
anywhere
without
progress
answer
me
that
will
you
man
because
it
real
we
not
going
any
place
now
no
place
at
all
now
look
forrester
said
patiently
progress
is
an
outmoded
idea
we
got
to
be
in
step
with
the
times
we
got
to
ask
ourselves
what
progress
ever
did
for
us
how
did
we
stand
when
the
gods
returned
for
a
brief
flash
he
was
back
in
his
history
class
but
he
went
on
half
the
world
ready
to
fight
the
other
half
with
weapons
that
would
have
wiped
both
halves
out
you
ought
to
be
grateful
the
gods
returned
when
they
did
but
we
getting
into
nowheresville
man
the
old
man
complained
we
not
in
orbit
we
ca
progress
forrester
sighed
why
was
he
talking
to
the
old
man
anyway
the
answer
came
to
him
as
soon
as
he
asked
the
question
he
wanted
to
keep
his
mind
off
the
tower
of
zeus
and
his
own
unknown
fate
there
it
was
an
unpleasant
answer
forrester
blanked
it
out
now
friend
he
said
what
have
you
got
just
what
mankind
been
looking
for
all
these
centuries
security
you
got
security
going
to
blow
you
to
pieces
tomorrow
your
job
is
going
to
vanish
overnight
i
mean
if
you
i
got
a
job
the
old
man
said
really
forrester
said
politely
what
is
it
retired
and
it
a
tough
job
too
oh
forrester
said
and
anyhow
the
old
man
went
on
what
all
this
got
to
do
with
progress
forrester
thought
well
well
nothing
the
old
man
said
listen
to
me
man
i
say
nothing
against
the
gods
right
nothing
at
all
would
want
to
do
anything
like
that
but
at
the
same
time
it
looks
to
me
like
we
ought
to
be
able
to
reap
the
fruits
of
our
labors
i
read
that
some
place
but
in
the
three
thousand
years
the
gods
were
gone
we
were
a
total
loss
man
not
anything
like
we
discovered
a
lot
about
nature
and
science
and
like
that
we
invented
science
all
by
ourselves
so
how
come
the
gods
do
let
us
use
it
the
old
man
dug
his
elbow
once
more
into
forrester
rib
how
come
the
gods
have
taken
anything
away
from
us
forrester
said
have
they
the
old
man
demanded
how
about
television
want
to
answer
that
one
years
ago
everybody
had
a
television
set
color
and
the
most
the
end
now
there
no
television
at
all
why
not
what
happened
to
it
well
forrester
said
reasonably
what
good
is
television
what
good
once
more
forrester
rib
felt
the
old
man
elbow
let
me
tell
you
no
forrester
interrupted
suddenly
irritated
with
the
whole
conversation
let
tell
the
trouble
with
your
generation
was
that
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
sit
around
on
their
and
be
entertained
like
a
bunch
of
hypnotized
geese
they
did
want
to
do
anything
for
themselves
half
of
them
could
even
read
and
now
you
want
to
tell
me
that
hold
it
the
old
man
said
you
telling
me
that
the
gods
took
away
television
just
because
we
were
a
bunch
of
hypnotized
geese
that
it
that
it
okay
the
old
man
said
so
tell
me
what
are
we
now
with
the
gods
and
everything
i
mean
man
really
what
are
we
now
forrester
said
now
you
retired
you
a
bunch
of
retired
hypnotized
geese
the
doors
of
the
train
slid
creakily
open
and
forrester
got
out
onto
the
street
platform
walking
angrily
toward
a
stairway
without
looking
back
true
enough
the
old
man
had
committed
blasphemy
but
it
had
certainly
come
close
enough
there
at
the
end
and
if
pokes
with
the
elbow
were
declared
blasphemous
or
at
least
equivalent
to
malicious
mischief
he
thought
there
was
no
justice
in
the
world
the
real
trouble
was
that
the
man
had
had
no
respect
for
the
gods
there
were
a
good
many
of
the
older
generation
like
him
they
seemed
to
feel
that
humanity
had
been
better
off
when
the
gods
had
been
away
forrester
could
see
it
and
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
in
the
presence
of
someone
who
believed
it
after
all
mankind
been
on
the
verge
of
mass
suicide
and
the
gods
had
mercifully
come
back
from
their
exile
and
taken
care
of
things
the
exile
had
been
designed
to
prove
in
the
drastic
laboratory
of
three
thousand
years
that
man
by
himself
headed
like
a
lemming
for
and
for
forrester
the
point
had
been
proven
yet
now
that
the
human
race
had
been
saved
there
were
still
men
who
griped
about
the
gods
and
their
return
forrester
silently
wished
the
pack
of
them
in
hades
enjoying
the
company
of
pluto
and
his
ilk
at
the
corner
of
and
broadway
as
he
came
out
of
the
subway
tunnels
he
bought
a
copy
of
the
and
glanced
quickly
through
the
headlines
but
as
always
there
was
little
sensational
news
mars
was
doing
pretty
well
for
himself
of
course
there
were
two
wars
going
on
in
asia
one
in
europe
and
three
revolutions
in
south
and
central
america
that
last
did
seem
to
be
overdoing
things
a
bit
but
not
seriously
forrester
shrugged
wondering
vaguely
when
the
united
states
was
going
to
have
its
turn
but
he
could
concentrate
on
the
paper
and
after
a
little
while
he
got
rid
of
it
and
took
a
look
at
his
watch
twenty
to
six
forrester
decided
he
could
use
a
drink
to
brace
himself
and
steady
his
nerves
just
one
on
sixth
avenue
near
street
there
was
a
bar
called
for
some
obscure
reason
the
forrester
headed
for
it
went
inside
and
leaned
against
the
bar
the
bartender
a
tall
man
with
reddish
hair
raised
his
eyebrows
in
a
questioning
fashion
what
it
be
friend
vodka
and
ginger
ale
forrester
said
a
double
it
was
still
he
told
himself
uneasily
just
one
drink
and
that
was
all
he
was
going
to
have
the
bartender
brought
it
and
forrester
sipped
at
it
watching
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
and
wishing
he
felt
easier
in
his
mind
about
the
whole
tower
of
zeus
affair
then
very
suddenly
he
noticed
that
the
man
next
to
him
was
looking
at
him
oddly
forrester
did
like
the
look
or
for
that
matter
the
man
himself
a
giant
with
eyes
and
a
shock
of
hair
but
so
long
as
nobody
bothered
him
forrester
was
going
to
start
anything
unfortunately
somebody
bothered
him
the
tall
man
leaned
over
and
said
loudly
what
the
matter
with
you
bud
an
infidel
or
something
forrester
hesitated
the
accusation
that
he
did
believe
in
the
practices
ordained
by
the
gods
themselves
was
an
irritating
one
but
he
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
question
too
the
tall
man
was
undoubtedly
a
dionysian
and
more
than
that
a
member
of
a
small
sect
inside
the
general
of
worshippers
he
held
that
it
was
wrong
to
distill
grape
or
grain
products
too
far
until
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
alcohol
that
meant
disapproval
of
gin
and
vodka
on
the
grounds
that
unlike
whiskey
or
brandy
they
had
the
life
distilled
out
of
them
forrester
however
was
not
really
fond
of
brandy
and
whiskey
he
decided
to
explain
this
to
the
tall
man
but
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
develop
the
sinking
feeling
that
it
was
going
to
do
any
good
oh
well
there
was
still
room
for
patience
do
fire
as
mars
had
said
somewhere
until
you
see
the
whites
of
their
eyes
no
i
no
infidel
forrester
said
politely
you
see
i
infidel
the
tall
man
roared
then
i
tell
you
what
you
do
you
pour
that
slop
out
and
drink
a
proper
drink
he
made
a
grab
for
forrester
glass
forrester
jerked
it
back
sloshing
it
a
little
in
the
process
and
a
few
drops
splattered
on
the
other
hand
now
look
here
forrester
said
in
a
reasonable
tone
of
voice
i
you
spilling
that
stuff
on
me
what
the
blazes
are
you
doing
that
for
i
got
a
good
mind
to
another
man
stepped
into
the
altercation
this
was
a
man
with
an
air
that
was
both
truculent
and
eager
the
matter
herb
he
asked
the
tall
man
this
guy
giving
you
trouble
or
something
he
favored
forrester
with
a
fierce
scowl
forrester
smiled
pleasantly
back
a
little
unsure
as
to
how
to
proceed
this
guy
herb
said
sam
he
an
forrester
said
i
he
drinks
vodka
herb
said
and
i
guess
he
drinks
gin
too
great
bacchus
sam
said
in
a
tone
of
wonder
you
run
into
them
everywhere
these
days
ca
get
away
from
the
sons
of
now
forrester
started
and
not
only
that
herb
said
but
he
spills
the
stuff
on
me
just
because
i
ask
him
to
have
a
regular
drink
like
a
man
it
on
you
sam
said
herb
said
look
and
extended
his
arm
on
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
a
few
spots
were
slowly
drying
well
that
too
much
sam
said
heavily
just
too
damn
much
he
scowled
at
forrester
again
you
know
buddy
somebody
ought
to
teach
guys
like
you
a
lesson
forrester
took
a
swallow
of
his
drink
and
set
the
glass
down
unhurriedly
if
either
herb
or
sam
attacked
him
he
knew
his
oath
would
permit
his
fighting
back
and
after
the
day
he
had
he
rather
looked
forward
to
the
chance
but
he
had
to
do
his
part
to
hold
off
an
actual
fight
now
look
here
friend
friend
sam
said
do
call
me
your
friend
buddy
i
make
no
friends
with
infidels
and
at
that
point
forrester
realized
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
fight
with
herb
or
sam
he
was
going
to
have
a
fight
with
herb
sam
and
with
the
third
gentleman
a
shaggy
beefy
man
who
needed
a
shave
who
stepped
up
behind
them
and
asked
trouble
in
a
voice
that
indicated
that
trouble
was
exactly
what
he
was
looking
for
maybe
it
is
trouble
at
that
herb
said
tightly
without
turning
around
this
infidel
here
been
committing
blasphemy
three
against
one
was
as
happy
a
thought
as
an
even
fight
had
been
but
it
was
too
late
to
back
out
now
that
a
lie
forrester
snapped
call
me
a
liar
sam
roared
he
stepped
forward
and
swung
a
hamlike
fist
at
forrester
head
forrester
ducked
the
heavy
fist
swished
by
his
ear
harmlessly
and
he
felt
a
strange
new
mixture
of
elation
and
fright
he
grabbed
his
from
the
bar
and
swung
it
in
a
single
sweeping
arc
before
him
liquid
rained
on
the
faces
of
the
three
men
sam
was
still
a
little
off
balance
forrester
slammed
the
edge
of
his
right
hand
into
his
side
and
sam
stumbled
to
the
floor
in
the
same
motion
forrester
let
fly
with
the
glass
the
shaggy
man
stood
directly
in
his
path
the
glass
conked
him
on
the
forehead
and
bounced
to
the
floor
where
it
shattered
unnoticed
the
shaggy
man
blinked
and
forrester
moving
forward
discovered
that
he
had
no
time
to
follow
matters
up
in
that
direction
herb
was
snarling
inarticulately
wiping
from
his
eyes
he
blocked
forrester
advance
toward
the
shaggy
man
forrester
smiled
gently
and
put
a
hard
fist
into
herb
solar
plexus
the
tall
man
doubled
up
in
completely
silent
agony
forrester
took
a
breath
and
started
forward
again
the
shaggy
man
was
shaking
his
head
trying
to
clear
it
then
forrester
head
became
unclear
something
had
banged
against
his
right
temple
and
the
room
was
suddenly
filled
with
pain
and
small
hard
stars
sam
forrester
discovered
had
managed
to
get
to
his
feet
the
something
had
been
a
small
brass
ashtray
that
sam
had
thrown
at
him
somehow
he
stayed
on
his
feet
the
stars
were
still
swirling
around
him
but
he
began
to
be
able
to
see
through
them
and
peered
at
the
figure
of
the
shaggy
man
coming
at
him
again
he
let
his
knees
bend
a
little
as
if
he
were
going
to
pass
out
the
shaggy
man
seemed
to
gain
confidence
from
this
and
stepped
in
carefully
to
kick
forrester
in
the
stomach
forrester
stepped
back
grabbed
the
upcoming
foot
and
stood
straight
lifting
the
foot
and
levering
it
into
the
air
the
shaggy
man
surprise
written
all
over
his
shaveless
face
went
over
backward
with
great
abruptness
his
head
hit
the
floor
with
an
audible
and
satisfying
and
then
his
limbs
settled
and
he
remained
there
sprawled
out
and
very
quiet
forrester
meanwhile
was
whirling
to
meet
sam
who
was
coming
in
like
a
bear
his
arms
outspread
and
a
glaze
of
hatred
in
his
eyes
forrester
expressionless
ducked
under
the
man
flailing
arms
and
slammed
a
fist
into
his
midsection
it
was
a
harder
midsection
than
he
expected
unlike
herb
sam
had
good
muscles
and
hitting
them
was
like
hitting
thick
rubber
the
blow
did
put
sam
down
it
only
made
him
gasp
once
that
was
enough
forrester
doubled
his
right
fist
and
let
sam
have
one
more
blow
this
one
into
the
face
sam
mouth
opened
as
his
eyes
closed
his
left
arm
pawed
the
air
aimlessly
for
a
tenth
of
a
second
then
he
dropped
like
an
empty
overcoat
there
was
a
second
of
absolute
silence
then
forrester
heard
a
noise
behind
him
and
whirled
but
it
was
only
herb
doubled
up
on
the
floor
and
very
quietly
retching
catching
his
breath
forrester
looked
around
him
the
fight
had
attracted
a
lot
of
attention
from
the
other
customers
in
the
bar
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
want
to
prolong
it
by
joining
in
they
were
all
trying
to
look
as
if
they
were
minding
their
own
business
while
the
bartender
forrester
stared
the
bartender
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
bar
far
away
from
the
scene
of
action
he
was
as
forrester
saw
him
just
hanging
up
the
telephone
forrester
put
a
bill
on
the
bar
turned
and
walked
out
into
the
street
he
had
absolutely
no
desire
to
get
mixed
up
with
the
secular
police
after
all
he
had
an
appointment
to
keep
and
now
after
a
quiet
drink
that
had
turned
into
a
battle
royal
he
had
to
go
and
keep
it
chapter
four
it
was
a
very
long
walk
from
the
to
the
tower
of
zeus
but
it
was
long
enough
by
the
time
forrester
got
to
the
tower
he
was
feeling
a
lot
worse
than
he
felt
when
he
left
the
bar
being
perfectly
frank
with
himself
he
admitted
that
he
felt
terrible
the
blow
from
the
brass
ashtray
was
a
sharp
pain
any
longer
it
had
developed
into
a
nice
dependable
ache
that
had
spread
all
over
the
side
of
his
head
and
his
right
eye
was
beginning
to
swell
probably
from
the
same
cause
he
skinned
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
too
probably
on
sam
face
and
they
set
up
their
own
smarting
true
it
was
a
bad
list
of
injuries
to
result
from
the
odds
faced
but
that
was
the
point
you
just
did
go
up
to
the
tower
of
zeus
looking
like
a
brawler
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
straightened
his
jacket
and
went
in
through
the
fifth
avenue
entrance
of
the
tower
heading
for
the
first
bank
of
elevators
zeus
would
know
everything
about
his
fight
and
would
know
that
it
had
been
his
fault
had
it
though
forrester
asked
himself
he
remembered
the
joy
he
felt
at
the
prospect
of
battle
how
far
would
it
count
against
him
zeus
through
his
priests
would
make
what
allowances
should
be
made
forrester
hoped
that
the
godhead
was
feeling
in
a
kind
and
merciful
mood
he
reached
the
bank
of
elevators
and
the
burly
myrmidon
who
stood
there
wearing
the
shoulder
patch
of
the
ahead
of
him
was
a
chattering
crowd
of
five
mother
father
two
daughters
and
a
small
son
all
obviously
the
tower
of
zeus
was
always
a
big
tourist
attraction
the
myrmidon
directed
them
to
the
stairway
that
led
to
the
arcade
the
main
attraction
for
most
visitors
to
the
tower
the
temple
of
sacrifice
was
located
up
there
while
the
ground
floor
was
filled
with
offices
of
the
secretaries
of
various
dignitaries
chattering
gaily
and
looking
around
them
in
a
kind
of
happy
awe
the
family
group
moved
off
and
forrester
stepped
up
to
the
myrmidon
who
said
stairway
right
over
there
to
your
no
forrester
said
he
reached
into
his
jacket
pocket
feeling
his
muscles
ache
as
he
did
so
he
drew
out
his
wallet
and
managed
to
extract
the
simple
card
he
been
given
in
the
temple
of
pallas
athena
the
card
which
carried
nothing
but
a
lightning
bolt
he
handed
it
to
the
myrmidon
who
looked
down
at
it
frowned
and
then
looked
up
what
this
for
he
said
well
forrester
began
and
then
caught
himself
he
been
told
not
to
explain
about
the
card
to
any
mortal
and
the
myrmidon
was
certainly
just
as
mortal
as
forrester
himself
or
any
other
hireling
of
the
gods
true
there
was
always
the
consideration
that
he
might
be
zeus
himself
in
disguise
but
that
was
a
consideration
that
bore
no
weight
at
present
even
if
the
myrmidon
turned
out
to
be
a
god
in
disguise
forrester
would
be
excused
if
he
said
anything
about
the
card
you
had
to
go
by
appearances
that
was
the
principle
on
which
everything
rested
and
a
very
good
principle
too
not
that
there
were
a
few
unprincipled
young
men
around
who
pretended
to
be
gods
in
disguise
in
order
to
seduce
various
local
and
ingenuous
maidens
but
zeus
always
found
out
about
them
and
forrester
recognized
that
his
thoughts
were
beginning
to
veer
once
more
without
changing
his
expression
he
said
evenly
you
supposed
to
know
and
waited
the
myrmidon
studied
him
for
what
seemed
about
three
days
at
last
he
nodded
looked
down
at
the
card
intently
raised
his
head
and
nodded
again
okay
he
said
take
car
one
forrester
moved
off
car
one
was
not
the
first
elevator
car
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
in
the
middle
bank
identified
only
by
a
small
placard
it
took
him
almost
five
minutes
to
find
it
and
by
the
time
he
stepped
toward
it
clocks
were
ticking
urgently
in
his
head
it
would
do
him
absolutely
no
good
to
be
late
but
another
myrmidon
was
standing
beside
the
closed
doors
of
the
elevator
car
forrester
hissed
in
his
breath
with
impatience
none
of
which
showed
on
his
face
and
then
caught
himself
certainly
zeus
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
if
zeus
had
thrown
these
delays
in
his
path
it
was
not
for
him
to
complain
the
thought
was
soothing
nevertheless
forrester
showed
his
card
to
the
myrmidon
with
an
abrupt
action
very
like
impatience
this
myrmidon
merely
glanced
at
it
in
a
bored
fashion
and
pushed
a
button
on
the
wall
behind
him
the
elevator
doors
opened
forrester
stepped
inside
and
the
doors
closed
forrester
was
alone
in
a
small
bronzed
cubicle
which
began
at
once
to
rise
rapidly
just
how
rapidly
he
was
unable
to
tell
there
were
no
indicators
at
all
on
the
elevator
and
the
opaque
doors
made
it
impossible
to
see
floors
flit
by
but
his
ears
rang
with
the
speed
and
when
the
car
finally
stopped
it
did
so
with
a
slight
jerk
that
threw
forrester
stiff
and
worried
off
balance
he
almost
fell
out
of
the
car
as
the
door
opened
and
clutched
at
something
for
support
the
something
was
the
arm
of
a
myrmidon
forrester
gaped
and
looked
around
he
was
in
a
plain
hallway
of
polished
marble
there
was
no
way
to
tell
how
many
stories
above
the
street
he
was
the
myrmidon
seemed
a
more
friendly
sort
than
his
compatriots
downstairs
and
wore
in
addition
to
the
usual
patch
the
two
silver
ants
of
a
captain
on
the
shoulders
of
his
uniform
he
nearly
smiled
at
forrester
but
not
quite
you
william
forrester
he
said
forrester
nodded
he
produced
the
id
card
and
handed
it
with
the
special
card
to
the
myrmidon
right
the
myrmidon
said
forrester
turned
right
the
myrmidon
stared
at
him
no
he
said
i
mean
it
all
right
you
all
right
thank
you
forrester
said
oh
the
myrmidon
looked
at
him
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
expected
he
said
at
last
in
a
flat
voice
come
with
me
he
started
down
the
hallway
forrester
followed
him
around
a
corner
to
an
ornate
bronzed
door
covered
with
depicting
the
actions
of
the
gods
among
themselves
and
among
men
the
myrmidon
seemed
unimpressed
by
the
magnificence
of
the
thing
he
pushed
it
open
and
bowed
low
to
as
far
as
forrester
could
see
nobody
in
particular
taking
no
chances
forrester
copied
his
bow
he
was
still
bent
when
the
myrmidon
announced
forrester
is
here
your
concupiscence
in
a
reverent
tone
of
voice
and
backed
off
a
step
narrowly
missing
forrester
himself
in
the
process
he
waved
a
hand
and
forrester
went
in
the
door
shut
halfway
behind
him
the
room
was
perfectly
unbelievable
its
rich
hangings
were
purple
velvet
draping
a
large
window
that
looked
out
on
forrester
gulped
it
was
impossible
to
be
this
high
new
york
was
spread
out
below
like
a
toy
city
he
jerked
his
eyes
away
from
the
window
and
back
to
the
rest
of
the
room
it
was
furnished
mainly
with
couches
big
couches
little
couches
puffy
ones
spare
ones
in
felt
velvet
fur
and
every
other
material
forrester
could
think
of
the
rooms
were
flocked
in
a
pale
pink
and
on
the
floor
was
a
rug
of
a
richer
pile
than
forrester
had
ever
seen
and
on
one
of
the
couches
the
largest
and
the
softest
she
reclined
she
was
clad
only
in
the
diaphanous
robes
of
her
calling
and
she
was
stacked
beside
her
little
maya
wilson
would
have
looked
about
eight
years
old
her
hair
was
as
red
as
the
inside
of
a
blast
furnace
and
had
about
the
same
effect
on
forrester
pulse
rate
her
face
was
a
slightly
rounded
oval
her
body
a
series
of
mathematically
indescribable
curves
forrester
did
the
only
thing
he
could
do
he
bowed
again
even
lower
than
before
come
in
william
forrester
said
the
high
priestess
of
the
veritable
primate
of
venus
for
new
york
herself
in
a
voice
that
managed
to
be
all
at
once
regal
pleasant
and
seductive
forrester
already
in
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
the
gaze
of
her
concupiscence
fell
on
the
door
you
may
retire
captain
she
said
to
the
waiting
myrmidon
and
allow
no
one
to
enter
here
until
i
give
notice
very
well
your
concupiscence
the
myrmidon
said
the
door
shut
forrester
snapped
erect
from
his
bow
and
then
realized
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
stand
there
until
he
had
more
information
what
was
the
high
priestess
of
aphrodite
doing
in
the
tower
of
zeus
anyway
and
always
supposing
she
had
the
right
to
be
there
as
of
course
she
must
have
had
what
did
she
want
with
william
forrester
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
this
was
turning
into
an
extremely
puzzling
day
first
there
had
been
the
message
and
the
card
admitting
him
to
the
tower
then
there
had
been
the
sigh
changed
in
character
maya
wilson
and
then
the
sigh
changed
again
into
a
faint
echo
of
a
groan
the
fight
in
the
now
he
was
having
an
audience
with
the
primate
of
venus
for
new
york
why
the
high
priestess
smile
gave
him
no
hint
she
raised
herself
to
a
sitting
position
and
patted
the
couch
sit
over
here
she
said
next
to
me
then
she
changed
her
mind
no
she
added
first
just
walk
over
here
stand
up
and
turn
around
slowly
forrester
brain
was
whirling
like
a
top
but
his
face
was
as
usual
expressionless
he
did
as
she
had
bid
him
wondering
frantically
what
was
going
on
and
why
after
he
had
turned
completely
around
and
stood
facing
her
again
the
high
priestess
simply
sat
and
studied
him
for
almost
a
full
minute
looking
him
up
and
down
with
eyes
that
were
totally
unreadable
forrester
waited
finally
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
you
do
she
said
in
a
reflective
tone
and
nodded
her
head
again
yes
you
do
forrester
could
restrain
his
questions
any
longer
he
burst
out
i
mean
he
continued
more
quietly
what
will
i
do
for
your
concupiscence
oh
for
whatever
honor
it
is
that
our
beloved
goddess
has
in
mind
for
you
the
high
priestess
said
offhandedly
i
can
certainly
see
that
you
will
do
a
little
pudgy
around
the
middle
but
that
a
trifle
and
hardly
matters
the
important
things
are
there
you
obviously
strong
and
quick
at
that
point
forrester
caught
up
with
the
first
sentence
of
her
explanation
the
the
goddess
he
said
faintly
certainly
the
high
priestess
said
else
why
would
i
give
you
audience
i
am
not
promiscuous
in
my
dealings
with
the
lay
world
i
sure
forrester
said
respectfully
the
high
priestess
looked
at
him
sardonically
of
course
you
are
she
said
however
the
important
thing
is
that
our
beloved
aphrodite
has
selected
you
william
forrester
for
some
high
honor
forrester
caught
her
word
for
the
goddess
and
remembered
thanking
his
lucky
stars
he
had
had
a
chance
to
slip
that
here
in
the
tower
it
was
protocol
to
refer
to
the
gods
and
goddesses
by
their
greek
names
alone
i
do
suppose
he
said
tentatively
that
you
have
any
idea
just
what
this
high
honor
is
you
william
forrester
the
high
priestess
began
in
some
rage
dare
to
question
her
tone
changed
oh
well
i
suppose
i
should
become
angry
with
no
she
shrugged
but
her
tone
carried
a
little
pique
frankly
i
do
know
what
the
honor
is
well
then
forrester
said
his
bearing
perfectly
calm
even
though
he
could
feel
his
stomach
sinking
to
ground
level
how
do
you
know
it
an
honor
the
thought
that
had
crossed
his
mind
was
almost
too
horrible
to
retain
but
he
had
to
say
it
perhaps
he
went
on
i
offended
the
gods
in
some
unusual
way
some
way
very
offensive
to
them
perhaps
you
have
and
perhaps
forrester
said
they
decided
on
some
exquisite
method
of
punishing
me
something
like
the
punishment
they
gave
tantalus
when
he
i
know
the
ways
of
the
gods
quite
well
thank
you
the
high
priestess
said
coolly
and
i
can
tell
you
that
your
fears
have
no
justification
but
please
the
high
priestess
said
raising
a
hand
if
the
gods
were
to
punish
you
they
would
simply
have
sent
out
a
squad
of
myrmidons
to
pick
you
up
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
perhaps
not
forrester
said
in
a
voice
that
did
sound
at
all
like
his
own
to
him
it
sounded
much
too
unconcerned
perhaps
i
have
offended
only
the
goddess
herself
the
idea
sounded
more
plausible
the
more
he
thought
about
it
certainly
the
would
back
up
his
favorite
daughter
in
punishing
a
mortal
certainly
he
would
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
and
still
the
myrmidons
would
have
not
necessarily
you
well
aware
of
the
occasional
arguments
and
quarrels
between
the
gods
i
am
the
high
priestess
said
not
without
irony
and
it
does
not
appear
seemly
that
an
ordinary
mortal
should
mention
i
teach
history
forrester
said
i
know
of
such
quarrels
especially
between
athena
and
aphrodite
and
it
obvious
since
i
an
acolyte
of
athena
it
may
be
that
aphrodite
wished
to
keep
my
arrest
secret
i
doubt
it
the
high
priestess
said
forrester
wished
he
could
believe
her
but
his
own
theory
looked
uncomfortably
plausible
it
certainly
looks
as
if
i
right
well
for
a
second
the
high
priestess
paled
visibly
the
freckles
that
went
with
her
red
hair
standing
out
clearly
on
her
face
and
giving
her
the
disturbing
appearance
of
an
no
however
forrester
reminded
himself
had
ever
been
built
like
the
high
priestess
then
she
regained
her
color
and
laughed
all
in
an
instant
for
a
minute
she
said
in
a
light
tone
you
almost
convinced
me
of
your
forebodings
but
there
nothing
in
them
there
could
be
forrester
opened
his
mouth
and
not
was
on
his
lips
but
he
never
got
a
chance
to
say
the
words
the
high
priestess
blinked
and
peered
more
closely
at
his
face
and
before
he
had
a
chance
to
speak
she
asked
him
what
happened
to
you
a
small
accident
forrester
said
quickly
it
was
a
lie
but
he
thought
a
pardonable
one
the
truth
was
just
too
complicated
to
spin
out
he
had
no
real
intent
to
deceive
but
the
high
priestess
shook
her
head
no
she
said
not
an
accident
a
fight
your
hands
are
skinned
and
bruised
very
well
forrester
said
it
was
a
fight
but
i
was
attacked
and
entitled
to
defend
myself
i
sure
the
high
priestess
said
yet
i
have
a
question
for
you
who
won
won
i
did
naturally
it
sounded
boastful
he
reflected
but
it
was
he
had
won
and
it
had
been
natural
to
him
to
do
so
his
build
and
strength
as
well
as
his
speed
had
made
any
other
outcome
unlikely
and
the
high
priestess
did
seem
to
take
offense
she
said
only
i
thought
so
just
a
moment
then
she
walked
over
to
a
telephone
it
was
a
simple
act
but
forrester
watched
it
fervently
first
she
stood
up
and
then
she
took
a
step
and
then
another
step
and
her
whole
body
moved
and
moved
it
was
marvelous
he
watched
her
bend
down
to
pick
up
the
phone
without
any
clear
idea
of
the
meaning
of
the
motions
the
motions
themselves
were
enough
every
curve
and
jiggle
and
bounce
was
engraved
forever
on
his
mind
the
high
priestess
dialed
a
number
waited
and
said
compliments
to
hermes
the
healer
an
indistinguishable
voice
answered
her
from
the
receiver
aphrodite
thanks
you
the
high
priestess
said
and
asks
if
hermes
might
send
one
of
his
priests
around
for
a
few
minor
ministrations
the
receiver
said
something
else
no
the
high
priestess
said
nothing
like
that
do
you
think
we
have
other
interests
such
as
they
are
again
the
receiver
just
a
black
eye
and
some
skin
lacerations
the
high
priestess
said
nothing
serious
and
the
receiver
replied
once
more
very
well
the
high
priestess
said
aphrodite
wishes
you
well
she
hung
up
she
came
back
to
the
couch
forrester
eyes
following
her
every
inch
of
the
way
she
sat
down
looked
up
and
said
what
the
matter
do
i
bore
you
me
forrester
all
but
cried
it
just
well
nothing
i
suppose
the
high
priestess
said
your
expression
training
forrester
explained
an
acolyte
does
well
not
to
express
his
emotions
too
clearly
the
high
priestess
nodded
casually
and
patted
the
couch
at
her
side
sit
down
here
next
to
me
forrester
did
so
gingerly
a
moment
of
silence
ensued
then
forrester
gathering
courage
said
thank
you
for
getting
a
healer
but
i
like
to
ask
you
yes
how
do
you
know
i
not
under
some
sort
of
carefully
concealed
arrest
after
all
you
said
before
that
you
were
sure
and
i
am
sure
the
high
priestess
said
aphrodite
herself
has
ordered
a
sacrifice
in
her
favor
a
sacrifice
from
you
and
aphrodite
does
not
accept
much
less
a
sacrifice
from
those
standing
in
her
disfavor
you
i
sure
the
high
priestess
said
oh
forrester
said
good
the
world
was
not
quite
as
black
as
it
could
have
been
and
still
it
was
not
exactly
shining
white
a
sacrifice
and
outside
the
door
forrester
could
hear
a
disturbance
what
did
that
mean
her
concupiscence
did
seem
to
hear
it
at
first
we
will
perform
the
rite
together
and
the
noise
grew
louder
what
that
she
said
it
was
the
sound
of
argument
forrester
realized
what
had
happened
it
the
priest
from
hermes
he
said
the
healer
you
forgot
to
tell
the
captain
of
myrmidons
to
let
him
in
my
goodness
the
high
priestess
said
so
i
did
it
slipped
my
mind
entirely
she
touched
forrester
cheek
affectionately
of
course
i
imagine
it
only
natural
to
be
a
bit
forgetful
when
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
the
captain
and
a
small
fat
priest
in
a
tunic
were
tangled
confusedly
outside
the
high
priestess
looked
away
from
them
in
disdain
and
said
regally
you
may
permit
the
healer
to
enter
captain
the
tangle
came
untied
and
the
little
priest
scooted
in
to
him
as
the
door
closed
again
the
high
priestess
whispered
sorry
i
did
expect
you
quite
so
soon
no
more
did
i
the
priest
waved
his
caduceus
furiously
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
twin
snakes
twined
round
it
were
moving
the
two
wings
above
them
beating
and
the
ball
surmounting
all
on
top
of
the
staff
traced
uneasy
designs
in
the
air
myrmidons
he
said
i
certainly
regret
if
you
boiled
down
their
brains
for
the
fat
content
one
alone
would
supply
the
temple
with
candles
for
a
year
just
beef
and
nothing
more
beef
beef
then
with
a
start
he
seemed
to
see
the
high
priestess
for
the
first
time
and
his
tone
changed
oh
he
said
good
evening
your
concupiscence
good
evening
the
high
priestess
said
in
an
indulgent
tone
well
well
well
the
priest
said
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
my
goodness
it
must
be
important
sure
enough
certainly
important
his
little
round
red
eager
face
seemed
to
shine
as
he
went
on
hermes
himself
transported
me
here
just
as
soon
as
you
called
really
oh
my
yes
the
priest
said
just
as
soon
as
ever
yes
hm
and
you
can
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
believe
me
your
concupiscence
take
my
word
when
i
tell
you
yes
hermes
the
priest
said
hermes
does
often
take
such
an
interest
i
may
say
such
a
interest
in
a
mortal
i
tell
you
and
you
can
believe
me
when
i
do
tell
you
that
i
do
i
sure
the
high
priestess
said
yes
the
priest
said
waving
his
caduceus
gently
he
blinked
the
patient
the
mortal
he
over
here
the
high
priestess
said
motioning
to
forrester
sitting
awestruck
on
the
couch
priests
of
hermes
were
common
enough
sights
but
a
priest
like
this
was
something
new
and
strange
in
his
experience
ah
the
priest
said
twinkling
at
him
so
there
you
are
eh
over
there
you
sitting
over
are
you
that
right
forrester
said
blankly
now
listen
to
me
carefully
the
high
priestess
said
you
not
to
ask
his
name
or
mention
anything
about
this
visit
to
anyone
understand
the
priest
blinked
oh
certainly
absolutely
without
doubt
already
been
told
that
you
might
say
already
certainly
think
of
such
a
thing
he
moved
over
and
stood
near
forrester
peering
down
at
him
my
goodness
he
said
let
me
see
that
eye
young
man
forrester
turned
his
head
wordlessly
oh
my
yes
the
priest
said
black
indeed
very
black
a
fight
my
yes
an
altercation
disagreement
discussion
battle
yes
forrester
cut
in
certainly
you
have
the
priest
said
and
what
the
other
fellow
look
like
eh
beaten
i
bet
you
look
a
strong
type
forrester
relaxed
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
while
the
priest
babbled
on
touching
his
wounds
gently
as
he
did
so
with
various
parts
of
his
caduceus
the
pain
vanished
with
a
touch
of
the
left
wingtip
and
the
lacerations
healed
instantly
as
they
were
caressed
with
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
various
coils
of
the
snakes
but
forrester
now
was
free
to
worry
arrest
was
out
of
the
question
as
the
high
priestess
had
said
on
the
evidence
it
was
clear
that
aphrodite
intended
to
honor
him
in
some
way
and
there
was
nothing
at
all
he
thought
wrong
with
an
honor
from
the
goddess
of
love
but
another
sacrifice
after
the
sacrifice
to
aphrodite
he
made
earlier
and
the
fight
he
gotten
into
he
just
did
quite
feel
up
to
it
it
would
do
to
refuse
but
well
the
priest
said
stepping
back
well
well
you
ought
to
be
all
right
now
young
fellow
right
as
rain
forrester
said
thanks
might
feel
a
little
soreness
tenderness
you
might
say
for
a
day
or
so
only
a
day
or
so
tenderness
the
priest
said
after
that
right
as
rain
right
as
you
ever
be
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
right
forrester
said
thanks
the
priest
went
to
the
door
turned
and
said
to
the
high
priestess
hermes
blessing
on
you
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
they
say
blessings
from
hermes
on
you
both
the
high
priestess
nodded
regally
and
the
priest
said
merely
by
the
way
as
it
might
be
without
meaning
harm
if
you
would
ask
a
blessing
for
me
aphrodite
blessing
easy
for
you
of
course
it
would
be
nice
curing
curing
as
they
say
stupidity
plain
dumbness
as
they
call
such
things
curing
stupidity
as
easily
as
i
can
cure
small
ills
nice
indeed
the
high
priestess
said
but
there
the
priest
went
on
only
the
gods
can
cure
that
only
the
gods
and
no
one
else
yes
hm
and
not
often
they
do
do
anything
like
that
in
the
ah
regular
course
of
things
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
might
say
i
never
heard
of
never
heard
of
such
a
case
never
not
one
yet
he
opened
the
door
spat
myrmidons
and
disappeared
into
the
hallway
the
door
banged
shut
forrester
sighed
heavily
the
high
priestess
turned
to
him
feel
better
she
asked
much
forrester
said
dreading
the
ordeal
to
come
the
high
priestess
came
over
to
the
couch
and
sat
down
next
to
him
she
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
shall
we
prepare
for
the
sacrifice
forrester
sighed
again
sure
he
said
naturally
when
she
was
locked
in
his
arms
it
was
as
if
time
had
started
all
over
again
forrester
responded
to
the
eagerness
of
the
woman
as
he
never
dreamed
he
could
respond
all
his
tiredness
dropped
away
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
he
was
a
new
man
he
touched
her
bare
flesh
and
felt
the
heat
of
her
through
his
fingers
and
hands
with
his
arms
around
her
nakedness
he
rolled
locked
to
her
feeling
the
friction
of
skin
against
skin
and
the
magnificence
of
her
the
sacrifice
went
on
and
on
and
on
into
endless
time
and
endless
space
forrester
thrust
and
gasped
at
the
woman
and
her
head
went
back
her
mouth
pulled
open
as
she
shivered
and
responded
to
him
forever
until
finally
they
lay
panting
in
the
magnificent
room
forrester
rose
first
vaguely
surprised
at
himself
he
found
a
towel
in
a
closet
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
wiped
his
damp
forehead
slowly
well
he
said
that
was
quite
a
sacrifice
what
next
the
high
priestess
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
and
stared
across
the
room
at
him
there
is
no
need
for
such
familiarity
forrester
she
said
not
from
a
lay
acolyte
forrester
tossed
the
towel
onto
a
couch
my
apologies
your
concupiscence
i
a
little
but
what
happens
next
the
high
priestess
reached
into
the
diaphanous
pile
of
her
clothing
and
came
up
with
a
small
watch
she
wore
usually
on
her
wrist
our
timing
was
almost
perfect
she
said
it
is
now
hours
the
goddess
expects
you
at
exactly
a
hurried
passed
then
fully
dressed
forrester
went
with
the
high
priestess
to
a
golden
door
in
the
hangings
at
the
side
of
the
room
she
made
a
series
of
mystical
signs
the
circle
the
serpent
and
others
forrester
could
quite
follow
she
opened
the
door
genuflecting
as
she
did
so
and
forrester
dropped
to
one
knee
behind
her
looking
at
the
doorway
it
was
filled
with
a
pale
blue
haze
that
looked
like
the
clear
summer
sky
on
a
hot
day
except
that
it
was
sky
but
a
curtain
that
wavered
and
shimmered
before
his
eyes
beyond
it
he
could
see
nothing
the
high
priestess
rose
from
her
genuflection
and
forrester
followed
suit
there
was
a
sole
second
of
silence
then
the
high
priestess
said
you
are
to
step
through
the
veil
of
heaven
william
forrester
forrester
said
through
the
of
do
be
afraid
she
said
and
do
try
to
touch
the
veil
just
walk
through
as
if
nothing
at
all
were
there
forrester
filled
his
lungs
as
though
he
were
going
to
take
a
very
high
dive
he
thought
goes
that
was
all
there
was
time
for
anything
else
he
stepped
into
the
blue
haze
and
had
a
sudden
sensation
of
falling
chapter
five
there
was
a
tingle
like
a
mild
electric
shock
forrester
opened
his
mouth
and
then
closed
it
again
as
the
tingle
stopped
and
the
sense
of
falling
simply
died
away
he
had
closed
his
eyes
on
the
way
into
the
curtain
and
now
he
opened
them
again
he
closed
them
very
quickly
counted
to
ten
and
took
a
deep
breath
then
he
opened
them
to
look
at
the
room
he
was
in
it
was
unlike
any
room
he
had
ever
seen
before
it
did
have
the
opulence
of
the
high
priestess
rooms
i
am
a
room
it
seemed
to
say
and
a
room
is
what
i
was
meant
to
be
i
do
have
to
draw
attention
to
myself
like
my
poorer
sisters
i
am
content
merely
to
exist
as
the
room
of
rooms
the
very
type
and
image
of
the
ideal
enclosure
the
floors
and
walk
of
the
place
seemed
to
blend
into
each
other
at
odd
angles
forrester
eyes
could
quite
follow
them
or
understand
them
and
judging
the
size
of
the
room
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
a
golden
wash
of
light
filling
the
room
though
it
did
seem
to
come
from
anywhere
in
particular
it
was
in
fact
as
if
the
room
itself
were
shining
forrester
blinked
and
rubbed
his
eyes
the
light
or
whatever
it
was
was
changing
color
gradually
he
realized
that
it
went
on
doing
that
he
was
sure
that
he
liked
it
but
it
was
certainly
different
the
colors
went
from
gold
to
pale
rose
to
violet
to
blue
and
so
on
back
to
gold
again
while
little
eddies
and
swirls
of
light
sparkled
into
rainbows
here
and
there
forrester
began
to
feel
dizzy
again
there
were
various
objects
standing
around
here
and
there
in
the
room
but
forrester
could
quite
tell
what
they
were
even
their
sizes
were
difficult
to
judge
because
of
the
shifting
light
and
shape
of
the
room
itself
there
was
only
one
thing
that
seemed
reasonably
certain
he
was
alone
in
the
room
set
in
one
wall
was
a
square
of
light
that
did
change
color
quite
as
much
as
everything
else
forrester
judged
it
to
be
a
window
and
headed
for
it
with
his
first
step
he
discovered
something
else
about
the
place
the
carpeting
was
completely
unique
instead
of
fiber
the
floor
seemed
to
have
been
covered
a
foot
deep
with
foam
rubber
forrester
exactly
walk
to
the
window
he
bounced
there
the
sensation
was
almost
enjoyable
he
thought
when
you
got
used
to
it
he
wondered
just
how
long
it
took
to
get
used
to
it
and
settled
on
eighty
years
as
a
good
first
guess
he
stood
in
front
of
the
window
he
looked
out
he
saw
nothing
but
clouds
and
sky
it
took
a
long
while
for
him
to
decide
what
to
do
next
and
when
he
finally
did
come
to
a
decision
it
was
the
wrong
one
he
looked
down
below
him
there
were
tumbled
rocks
ledges
of
ice
and
snow
clouds
and
far
far
below
the
flat
land
of
the
earth
he
wanted
to
shut
his
eyes
but
he
could
the
whole
vast
panorama
spread
out
beneath
him
endlessly
the
people
below
if
there
were
any
even
big
enough
to
be
ants
they
were
completely
invisible
forrester
took
a
deep
breath
and
gripped
the
side
ledges
of
the
window
and
a
voice
behind
him
said
welcome
mortal
forrester
almost
went
through
the
window
but
he
managed
to
regain
his
balance
and
turn
around
saying
angrily
do
that
as
the
last
of
the
words
left
his
lips
he
became
aware
of
the
smiling
figure
facing
him
she
was
standing
in
a
spotlight
forrester
thought
at
first
then
he
saw
that
the
light
was
coming
from
the
woman
herself
or
from
her
clothing
the
dress
she
wore
was
a
satinlike
sheath
that
glowed
with
an
aura
even
brighter
than
the
room
her
blonde
hair
picked
up
the
radiance
and
glowed
too
illuminating
a
face
that
was
at
once
regal
inviting
and
passionate
it
was
forrester
thought
a
hell
of
a
disturbing
combination
the
cloth
of
the
dress
clung
to
her
figure
as
if
it
wanted
to
forrester
did
blame
it
a
bit
the
dress
showed
off
a
figure
that
was
not
only
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
but
a
long
way
beyond
what
he
had
hitherto
regarded
as
the
bounds
of
possibility
from
shoulder
to
toe
she
was
perfection
this
was
also
true
of
the
woman
from
shoulder
to
crown
forrester
gulped
and
automatically
went
on
one
knee
please
he
murmured
pardon
me
i
did
mean
quite
all
right
the
goddess
murmured
i
understand
perfectly
but
i
never
mind
all
that
now
venus
said
with
just
a
hint
of
impatience
rise
william
forrester
or
you
who
were
william
forrester
forrester
rose
sweat
was
pouring
down
his
face
he
made
no
effort
to
wipe
it
away
were
he
asked
dazed
but
that
my
name
it
venus
said
in
the
same
calm
tone
henceforth
your
name
is
dionysus
forrester
took
a
while
to
remember
to
swallow
dionysus
he
said
at
last
there
was
another
silence
forrester
feeling
that
perhaps
his
first
question
could
use
some
amplification
said
dionysus
bacchus
you
mean
me
quite
right
venus
said
that
will
be
your
name
and
you
better
begin
getting
used
to
it
now
wait
a
minute
he
said
i
do
mean
to
be
disrespectful
but
something
occurs
to
me
i
mean
it
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
and
i
probably
wrong
but
just
let
me
ask
the
questions
if
you
mind
and
maybe
some
of
this
will
make
some
sense
because
just
a
few
hours
ago
i
was
doing
very
nicely
on
my
own
and
i
what
are
your
questions
venus
said
forrester
swayed
himself
he
said
wo
he
mind
my
venus
laughed
mind
your
using
his
name
my
goodness
no
but
it
all
because
of
the
orgies
venus
said
everything
he
told
himself
was
getting
just
a
little
too
much
for
him
orgies
he
said
venus
nodded
you
see
there
are
all
those
orgies
held
in
his
honor
you
know
about
those
of
course
sure
i
do
forrester
said
watching
everything
narrowly
in
just
a
few
seconds
he
told
himself
hopefully
the
whole
room
would
vanish
and
he
would
be
in
a
nice
peaceful
insane
asylum
well
it
is
impossible
for
a
god
to
be
at
all
the
orgies
held
in
his
honor
venus
said
naturally
not
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
all
rather
boring
for
a
god
i
mean
and
that
why
you
here
she
finished
forrester
said
oh
and
then
he
said
oh
the
room
disappeared
yet
but
he
was
willing
to
give
it
time
dionysus
venus
said
patiently
as
if
she
were
explaining
the
matter
to
a
small
and
rather
ugly
child
gets
tired
of
appearing
at
the
orgies
he
wants
someone
to
take
his
place
the
silence
after
that
sentence
was
a
very
long
one
forrester
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
but
you
will
be
raised
to
the
status
of
godling
venus
said
you
remember
hercules
and
achilles
do
you
never
met
them
forrester
said
vacantly
naturally
venus
said
they
were
however
ancient
heroes
raised
to
the
status
of
godling
just
as
you
yourself
will
be
however
you
will
not
be
honored
or
worshipped
under
your
own
name
forrester
nodded
naturally
he
said
wondering
what
he
was
talking
about
there
was
he
realized
the
possibility
that
he
was
not
insane
after
all
but
he
did
want
to
think
about
that
it
was
much
too
painful
you
will
receive
instructions
in
the
use
of
certain
powers
venus
said
these
will
enable
you
to
perform
your
new
duties
duties
the
word
carried
a
strange
connotation
was
the
god
of
wine
among
other
things
and
women
and
song
had
been
thrown
in
as
an
afterthought
the
duties
of
a
for
a
god
like
that
sounded
just
a
little
bit
overwhelming
these
duties
he
said
will
they
be
temporary
or
permanent
well
venus
said
that
depends
she
smiled
at
him
sweetly
depends
so
far
venus
said
our
testing
shows
that
you
are
capable
of
handling
certain
of
the
duties
to
be
entrusted
to
you
but
for
the
rest
everything
depends
on
your
own
talents
and
devotion
ah
forrester
said
and
then
testing
you
do
suppose
that
we
would
pick
a
mortal
for
an
important
job
like
this
without
making
certain
that
he
was
capable
of
doing
the
job
do
you
frankly
forrester
said
i
have
got
around
to
supposing
anything
yet
venus
smiled
again
we
have
tested
you
she
said
and
so
far
you
appear
perfectly
capable
of
exercising
your
powers
forrester
blinked
exercising
exactly
as
a
street
brawler
for
instance
you
do
exceptionally
well
as
a
how
does
your
face
feel
she
asked
my
what
forrester
said
oh
face
fine
street
brawls
you
said
i
did
venus
said
my
goodness
the
way
you
bashed
that
one
bruiser
with
your
drink
that
was
really
excellent
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
feel
it
incumbent
on
me
to
tell
you
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
fight
so
much
in
years
wondering
whether
he
should
be
complimented
or
just
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
forrester
said
nothing
at
all
the
idea
that
he
had
been
under
the
personal
supervision
of
aphrodite
herself
bothered
him
more
than
he
could
say
the
brawl
was
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
it
seem
like
the
sort
of
thing
a
goddess
of
love
ought
to
have
been
watching
and
then
he
thought
of
the
high
priestess
he
felt
a
blush
creeping
up
around
his
collar
and
was
thankful
only
that
it
was
not
visible
under
the
tan
of
his
skin
he
remembered
who
had
ordered
the
sacrificial
rites
and
thought
bitterly
and
guiltily
about
spectator
sports
but
his
face
remained
perfectly
calm
so
far
venus
said
i
must
say
that
you
have
come
through
with
flying
colors
you
should
be
proud
of
yourself
forrester
did
feel
exactly
proud
he
wanted
to
crawl
into
a
hole
and
die
there
well
he
said
i
but
there
is
more
aphrodite
said
more
the
idea
did
sound
attractive
in
spite
of
what
one
of
the
tests
had
involved
the
notion
of
any
more
tests
was
just
a
little
fatiguing
besides
forrester
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
would
be
at
his
best
when
he
knew
that
dispassionate
observers
were
chronicling
his
technique
and
his
every
movement
how
much
more
he
wondered
could
he
take
and
he
reflected
how
much
more
of
we
must
be
certain
aphrodite
said
that
you
can
prove
yourself
worthy
of
the
dignity
of
a
godling
ah
forrester
said
cleverly
so
there
are
going
to
be
more
tests
there
are
venus
said
after
all
you
will
be
expected
to
act
as
the
of
dionysus
that
involves
responsibilities
almost
beyond
the
ken
of
a
mortal
wine
forrester
thought
wildly
women
and
song
he
wondered
if
he
were
going
to
be
asked
to
sing
something
he
remember
anything
except
the
spangled
and
an
exceptionally
silly
rhyme
from
his
childhood
neither
of
them
seemed
just
right
for
the
occasion
you
must
learn
to
behave
as
a
true
god
venus
said
and
we
must
know
whether
you
are
fitted
for
the
part
forrester
nodded
the
one
thing
keeping
him
sane
he
reflected
was
the
hope
of
insanity
but
the
room
was
still
there
and
venus
was
standing
near
him
talking
quietly
away
thus
she
said
there
must
be
further
tests
so
that
we
may
be
sure
of
your
capacities
capacities
just
what
was
supposed
to
mean
i
see
he
lied
and
suppose
i
fail
fail
suppose
i
do
live
up
to
expectations
forrester
said
well
then
venus
declared
i
afraid
the
gods
might
be
angry
with
you
forrester
had
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
either
he
lived
up
to
expectations
or
he
did
live
at
all
the
gods
anger
was
not
a
small
affair
and
it
seldom
satisfied
itself
with
small
results
when
a
god
got
angry
with
you
you
simply
hoped
the
result
would
be
quick
you
did
really
dare
hope
it
would
also
be
temporary
forrester
passed
a
hand
over
his
forehead
if
he
had
been
doing
his
own
picking
he
thought
a
little
sadly
the
job
of
tryout
for
dionysus
was
not
the
job
he
would
have
chosen
but
then
the
choice
was
his
and
it
never
had
been
it
was
the
gods
who
had
picked
him
unfortunately
if
he
failed
the
mistake
would
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
gods
it
would
be
laid
at
the
door
of
william
forrester
together
with
a
nice
big
black
funeral
wreath
but
it
did
sound
too
bad
at
that
he
told
himself
hopefully
after
all
it
was
every
day
that
a
man
was
offered
the
job
of
for
a
god
not
every
day
that
a
man
was
offered
the
chance
of
passing
a
lot
of
strenuous
and
embarrassing
tests
and
dying
if
he
failed
he
told
himself
sternly
to
look
on
the
positive
side
but
all
he
could
think
of
was
the
succession
of
tests
still
to
come
what
would
they
be
like
how
could
he
ever
pass
them
all
what
would
be
thought
necessary
to
establish
a
man
as
a
double
for
dionysus
looks
he
thought
were
obviously
the
first
thing
and
he
certainly
had
those
for
a
second
he
almost
wished
he
could
see
ed
symes
and
apologize
for
getting
mad
when
ed
had
told
him
he
looked
like
bacchus
but
then
he
reflected
he
did
want
to
go
too
far
the
idea
of
apologizing
to
ed
symes
no
matter
who
his
sister
was
made
gorge
rise
about
five
and
a
half
feet
however
aphrodite
went
on
as
if
she
had
just
thought
of
something
too
unimportant
to
bother
mentioning
do
worry
about
it
my
thunderbolt
need
concern
you
i
have
every
confidence
that
you
will
prove
yourself
she
smiled
radiantly
at
him
the
idea
occurred
to
forrester
that
she
just
did
think
that
a
mortal
mortality
was
important
but
the
idea
did
stay
long
being
reassured
by
a
goddess
he
told
himself
confusedly
was
very
reassuring
venus
was
looking
him
up
and
down
speculatively
and
forrester
suddenly
thought
a
new
test
was
coming
a
little
gentle
sweat
began
to
break
out
on
his
forehead
again
but
his
face
stayed
calm
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
tried
to
concentrate
on
gathering
strength
the
high
priestess
had
been
something
special
but
forrester
thought
she
had
not
really
called
out
his
venus
was
clearly
another
matter
but
venus
said
only
those
clothes
in
a
considering
sort
of
tone
clothes
forrester
said
trying
to
readjust
in
a
hurry
you
certainly
ca
go
in
those
clothes
hera
would
object
quite
violently
i
afraid
she
awfully
stuffy
about
such
things
the
intimate
details
about
the
gods
intrigued
forrester
stuffy
hera
confidentially
venus
said
at
times
the
can
be
an
absolute
bitch
she
went
over
to
one
of
the
walls
and
a
part
of
the
light
seemed
to
fade
as
she
did
so
of
course
she
did
nothing
so
crude
as
opening
a
door
when
she
started
for
the
wall
there
was
no
closet
apparent
there
but
when
she
arrived
it
was
there
solid
and
open
it
was
just
that
simple
she
took
out
a
white
robe
and
started
back
forrester
took
his
eyes
from
her
with
an
effort
and
watched
the
closet
disappear
again
by
the
time
she
had
reached
him
it
was
only
a
part
of
the
swirling
wall
again
and
the
hospital
attendants
were
nowhere
in
sight
she
handed
forrester
the
robe
he
took
it
warily
but
it
seemed
real
enough
at
any
rate
it
was
as
real
as
anything
else
that
was
happening
to
him
he
thought
it
was
a
simple
tunic
cut
in
the
style
of
the
ancient
greek
and
open
at
one
side
instead
of
the
front
forrester
turned
it
in
his
hands
at
the
waist
and
shoulder
there
was
a
golden
clasp
to
hold
it
in
place
the
clasp
was
figured
in
any
special
way
the
material
itself
was
odd
it
was
an
almost
fluorescent
white
and
though
it
was
perfectly
opaque
it
was
thinner
than
any
paper
forrester
had
ever
seen
in
public
it
almost
did
seem
to
be
there
when
he
rubbed
it
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
well
do
just
stand
there
venus
said
get
started
started
forrester
said
get
dressed
the
others
are
waiting
for
you
others
but
she
did
answer
forrester
looked
frantically
around
the
room
for
anything
that
looked
even
remotely
like
a
dressing
room
as
a
last
resort
he
was
willing
to
settle
for
a
screen
no
room
no
screen
he
was
willing
to
settle
for
a
chair
he
could
crouch
behind
there
was
none
he
looked
hopefully
at
the
goddess
perhaps
he
thought
she
would
leave
while
he
dressed
she
showed
no
sign
of
doing
so
he
cleared
his
throat
and
jerked
at
his
collar
nervously
now
now
venus
said
sternly
do
tell
me
the
presence
of
your
goddess
embarrasses
you
she
raised
her
head
imperiously
hurry
it
up
very
slowly
he
began
taking
off
his
clothes
there
was
after
all
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
he
told
himself
as
a
matter
of
fact
venus
ought
to
be
getting
used
to
the
sight
of
him
undressing
by
this
time
somehow
he
finally
managed
to
get
the
on
straight
venus
looked
him
over
and
nodded
her
approval
come
along
now
she
said
they
waiting
for
us
and
one
thing
do
get
nervous
for
hera
sake
you
all
right
oh
forrester
said
sure
perfectly
all
right
right
as
rain
well
you
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
you
make
a
fine
dionysus
she
led
him
toward
a
wall
opposite
where
the
closet
had
been
as
they
approached
it
a
section
of
it
became
bluer
and
bluer
with
a
sinking
feeling
forrester
told
himself
that
he
knew
what
was
coming
he
did
the
wall
dissolved
into
the
shimmering
blue
haze
of
a
veil
of
heaven
just
like
the
one
that
had
transported
him
from
new
york
to
his
present
position
where
that
was
he
was
entirely
sure
but
remembering
his
one
look
out
the
window
he
suspected
it
was
mount
olympus
but
there
was
any
time
for
thinking
venus
took
his
hand
coolly
as
they
reached
the
blue
haze
then
both
of
them
stepped
through
chapter
six
the
room
into
which
they
stepped
seemed
even
larger
than
the
one
they
had
left
the
distances
were
just
as
hard
to
measure
and
why
forrester
had
the
feeling
he
could
have
said
but
it
did
feel
larger
the
sense
of
enormous
space
hung
over
it
the
wall
colors
were
just
the
same
however
dripping
and
changing
in
a
continuous
flow
of
patterns
with
the
little
sunbursts
and
rainbows
appearing
here
and
there
without
any
visible
reason
but
the
room
itself
was
comparatively
unimportant
forrester
knew
it
was
what
went
on
in
the
room
that
sent
shivers
up
his
spine
and
instructed
one
knee
to
start
knocking
against
other
one
he
had
heard
of
the
court
of
the
gods
though
as
far
as
he
knew
no
mortal
had
ever
seen
it
there
were
certainly
no
photographs
of
it
even
in
the
most
exhaustive
travel
books
forrester
knew
without
question
that
he
was
standing
in
that
courtroom
the
knowledge
did
not
make
him
calm
and
the
beings
sitting
and
reclining
on
couches
along
the
shimmering
walls
made
him
feel
even
worse
he
recognized
every
one
of
them
and
every
one
sent
a
new
shock
of
awe
running
through
his
nerves
his
stomach
felt
like
a
hard
rubber
handball
there
was
zeus
with
his
great
silvery
ringleted
beard
his
hands
were
combing
through
it
and
he
was
frowning
majestically
into
the
distance
next
to
him
was
the
imperious
hera
mother
of
the
gods
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
world
to
be
announced
there
was
mars
tough
and
scratching
his
side
with
one
hand
and
scowling
horribly
his
fierce
bearded
face
looked
somehow
out
of
place
without
the
battle
helmet
that
usually
topped
it
the
horned
and
pan
was
there
and
vulcan
crippled
and
ugly
with
his
squat
body
and
giant
arms
reclining
like
an
ape
on
a
couch
all
alone
and
motherly
looking
ceres
using
one
hand
to
pat
her
hair
as
if
she
not
forrester
were
the
nervous
one
athena
was
there
too
lovely
and
she
seemed
to
be
smiling
at
him
with
special
favor
and
forrester
felt
grateful
he
needed
all
the
help
he
could
get
but
the
other
gods
were
absent
where
were
they
pluto
and
phoebus
apollo
were
missing
and
so
were
mercury
neptune
dionysus
and
diana
and
ah
the
great
voice
of
zeus
boomed
as
forrester
and
venus
stepped
through
the
veil
forrester
heard
the
voice
and
shuddered
the
mortal
is
here
zeus
went
on
in
his
roar
welcome
mortal
forrester
opened
his
mouth
but
hera
got
in
ahead
of
him
she
leaned
over
to
her
divine
husband
and
hissed
in
a
tone
audible
to
everyone
in
the
room
do
belabor
the
obvious
dear
enough
it
is
zeus
said
the
roar
was
exactly
the
same
i
not
at
all
sure
no
of
course
not
naturally
not
my
dear
naturally
not
he
looked
around
slowly
nodding
his
great
head
now
now
let
see
do
we
have
a
quorum
i
do
see
morpheus
where
morpheus
asleep
as
usual
mars
growled
he
finished
scratching
his
side
and
began
on
his
beard
where
else
would
the
old
fool
be
he
nothing
but
a
bore
anyway
and
i
say
to
hades
with
him
let
get
on
now
ares
pallas
athena
said
mildly
do
be
crude
crude
mars
bellowed
all
i
said
was
that
the
old
bore
not
here
it
true
is
it
what
in
hades
is
so
crude
about
it
hah
vulcan
growled
in
a
bass
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
bottom
of
a
large
barrel
look
who
mentions
being
a
bore
why
you
mars
started
children
hera
snapped
at
once
there
was
quiet
and
forrester
had
time
to
get
dizzy
maybe
he
thought
he
had
been
traveling
too
much
after
all
he
had
started
in
new
york
and
then
he
had
found
himself
on
what
he
suspected
was
mount
olympus
in
greece
and
now
he
was
somewhere
else
he
was
entirely
sure
where
the
court
of
the
gods
existed
he
knew
that
but
he
had
never
heard
just
where
it
existed
and
it
was
entirely
possible
that
no
mortal
knew
in
which
case
forrester
thought
confusedly
i
do
even
know
where
i
am
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
think
seriously
that
perhaps
he
was
sane
after
all
maybe
everything
he
was
seeing
and
hearing
was
true
it
was
certainly
beginning
to
look
that
way
and
in
that
case
maybe
the
dizziness
he
felt
was
just
airsickness
or
spacesickness
or
whatever
kind
of
sickness
came
from
traveling
through
those
blue
veils
at
least
he
told
himself
thinking
of
the
old
man
he
had
met
on
the
way
downtown
at
least
it
beat
the
subway
he
looked
behind
him
he
and
venus
were
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
there
was
no
blue
veil
behind
them
it
had
apparently
done
its
duty
and
gone
away
the
subway
forrester
told
himself
solemnly
did
do
that
zeus
cleared
his
throat
ponderously
i
count
eight
of
us
he
said
eight
all
told
of
course
that
eight
without
the
mortal
he
paused
and
then
added
if
you
count
the
mortal
in
there
are
nine
pan
stirred
that
a
quorum
he
announced
in
a
hoarse
voice
that
had
a
heavy
vibrato
in
it
it
reminded
forrester
oddly
of
the
bleating
of
a
goat
pan
crossed
his
legs
and
his
hooves
clashed
striking
sparks
pluto
and
poseidon
said
they
accept
our
judgment
why
the
absence
vulcan
said
shortly
a
storm
i
think
pan
said
out
in
the
north
atlantic
if
memory
serves
and
it
does
as
far
as
i
recall
there
are
four
ships
sunk
so
far
quite
an
affair
vulcan
said
ah
and
reclined
again
hera
leaned
forward
where
apollo
he
said
he
might
come
sure
he
did
mars
said
heavily
old
sunshine
boy
never
misses
a
bit
of
excitement
only
he
probably
found
something
even
more
exciting
in
california
all
dressed
up
as
a
mortal
california
ceres
said
my
goodness
what
would
that
boy
be
doing
in
california
mars
guffawed
probably
showing
off
how
sunshine
boy
loves
to
show
off
displaying
that
gorgeous
body
to
the
girls
on
muscle
beach
bet
eight
to
five
pan
said
at
once
mars
turned
to
him
and
nodded
shortly
done
now
if
i
were
a
betting
man
vulcan
began
in
a
thoughtful
bass
i
we
all
know
what
you
do
gimpy
mars
roared
but
you
wo
do
it
so
shut
up
about
it
please
hera
said
order
her
voice
was
like
chilled
steel
the
others
settled
back
i
think
we
ready
shall
we
begin
dear
she
looked
at
zeus
who
got
ready
to
start
but
before
he
could
get
a
word
out
there
was
a
flicker
of
blue
energy
in
the
room
a
couple
of
yards
away
from
forrester
and
venus
the
flicker
expanded
to
a
veil
and
a
man
stepped
out
of
it
he
was
a
short
fat
individual
wearing
a
as
if
he
had
slept
in
it
for
three
or
four
weeks
his
face
was
puffy
and
his
golden
hair
was
ruffled
his
eyelids
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
permanent
and
beneath
them
the
eyes
were
bleary
and
disinterested
forrester
needed
no
introductions
to
morpheus
the
god
of
sleep
the
god
looked
around
at
the
assembled
company
with
a
kindly
little
smile
on
his
tired
face
then
slowly
and
luxuriously
he
yawned
when
his
mouth
closed
again
after
a
view
of
caverns
measureless
to
man
he
rubbed
at
his
eyes
with
his
knuckles
and
then
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
apparently
resigned
himself
to
the
terrible
effort
of
speech
i
late
he
said
but
it
really
not
my
fault
oh
hera
said
in
a
nasty
tone
of
voice
morpheus
shook
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
it
really
is
his
voice
was
terribly
calm
it
was
obvious
forrester
thought
that
he
did
not
give
a
damn
the
alarm
just
did
seem
to
go
off
again
or
else
i
did
hear
it
now
morpheus
hera
said
i
should
think
you
get
some
kind
of
alarm
that
really
worked
after
all
this
time
why
bother
morpheus
said
and
shrugged
ponderously
anyhow
here
he
yawned
again
the
thing
tiresome
but
i
did
say
i
be
here
and
here
i
am
now
does
that
satisfy
everybody
because
if
it
does
i
do
have
some
sleep
to
catch
up
on
it
satisfies
us
all
hera
said
with
some
asperity
go
sit
down
morpheus
shambled
quietly
over
to
a
couch
near
mars
he
lowered
himself
onto
it
and
slowly
slipped
from
a
sitting
position
to
a
reclining
one
well
hera
said
to
zeus
we
ready
dear
oh
zeus
said
oh
certainly
i
declare
this
meeting
i
declare
this
meeting
fully
met
he
cleared
his
throat
with
a
rumble
that
shook
the
air
we
here
as
i
suppose
you
all
know
to
consider
the
problem
of
william
forrester
but
first
i
am
reminded
of
a
little
story
i
picked
up
on
earth
and
in
the
hopes
that
some
of
you
here
might
not
have
heard
it
i
we
heard
it
hera
said
and
anyhow
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
zeus
turned
to
look
at
her
he
shrugged
very
well
he
said
equably
let
us
return
to
william
forrester
as
a
possible
substitute
for
dionysus
the
first
consideration
ought
to
be
the
psychological
records
would
you
say
i
would
hera
said
through
her
teeth
i
believe
athena
is
in
charge
of
that
department
and
if
she
is
ready
to
report
of
course
she
ready
hera
said
dear
zeus
nodded
well
then
what
are
we
waiting
for
athena
got
up
and
faced
the
company
in
general
she
began
at
once
i
think
we
can
pass
the
candidate
completely
on
the
psychological
records
the
index
of
subordination
is
low
but
we
do
want
one
too
high
for
this
post
too
the
beta
curve
shows
a
good
deal
of
variation
a
dionysian
characteristic
there
is
perhaps
a
stronger
sense
of
responsibility
than
is
recorded
in
the
dionysian
index
but
this
may
not
be
a
handicap
by
no
means
hera
said
responsibility
is
something
we
could
all
do
with
more
of
around
here
she
shot
a
poisonous
glance
at
morpheus
whose
eyes
were
now
completely
closed
forrester
busily
wondering
what
his
beta
curve
was
and
why
it
varied
and
what
he
would
do
if
he
lost
it
and
had
to
get
another
one
missed
the
next
few
words
of
athena
report
the
word
that
did
impinge
on
his
consciousness
did
so
with
a
shock
sex
athena
said
but
after
all
that
is
not
quite
in
my
department
she
looked
as
if
she
were
very
glad
of
the
fact
in
general
as
i
say
the
psychological
tests
present
no
insuperable
barriers
fine
hera
said
she
dug
zeus
in
the
ribs
again
oh
zeus
said
yes
fine
next
hera
said
yes
zeus
said
by
all
means
next
mars
got
up
he
was
now
scratching
the
hair
on
his
chest
he
looked
around
at
the
others
with
a
definitely
unfriendly
expression
the
physical
department
is
mine
he
said
the
candidate
can
handle
himself
all
right
there
is
much
doubt
of
it
he
burped
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
one
hand
and
went
on
of
course
he
let
himself
run
to
fat
a
little
here
and
there
but
it
is
really
serious
mainly
a
matter
of
glandular
balance
or
something
like
that
as
far
as
i
understand
hermes
report
forrester
began
to
feel
like
a
prize
chicken
and
physical
training
mars
said
well
there
has
any
training
that
all
and
that
bad
he
is
not
being
considered
for
your
position
vulcan
said
one
muscular
brainless
imbecile
is
enough
mars
took
a
deep
breath
please
hera
said
continue
the
report
the
breath
came
out
in
an
explosion
all
right
mars
said
discounting
the
training
end
of
things
and
assuming
that
hermes
can
fix
up
the
glandular
mess
i
think
he
can
pass
the
physical
forrester
was
sure
that
he
liked
being
referred
to
as
a
glandular
mess
on
the
other
hand
he
asked
himself
what
could
he
do
about
it
he
stood
quietly
wondering
what
was
coming
next
his
worst
fears
were
fulfilled
venus
stepped
forward
and
gave
her
report
basically
it
was
a
codicil
of
a
rather
specialized
nature
to
the
physical
report
while
it
was
going
on
forrester
glanced
at
athena
she
looked
every
bit
as
embarrassed
as
he
felt
and
her
face
wore
a
look
of
sheer
pain
once
he
thought
she
was
going
to
leave
the
room
but
she
remained
grimly
seated
until
it
was
all
over
forrester
could
figure
out
when
he
thought
about
it
how
the
gods
had
managed
to
give
him
all
these
tests
without
his
knowing
anything
about
it
but
then
they
were
supernatural
were
they
and
they
had
their
own
methods
a
mortal
did
have
to
understand
them
forrester
was
sure
he
was
happy
with
that
idea
but
he
clung
to
it
it
was
the
only
one
he
had
when
venus
finished
her
report
there
was
a
little
silence
any
other
comments
hera
whispered
to
her
husband
ah
yes
zeus
said
other
comments
if
anyone
has
any
other
comments
to
make
please
make
them
now
now
is
the
time
to
make
them
he
sat
back
morpheus
stirred
slightly
and
spoke
without
opening
his
eyes
or
sitting
up
sleep
he
said
hera
said
sleep
very
important
morpheus
said
slowly
the
candidate
sleeps
pretty
well
soundly
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
trouble
is
that
he
get
enough
sleep
but
then
no
one
on
this
entire
crazy
world
ever
does
he
yawned
and
added
not
even
me
forrester
passed
a
hand
over
his
forehead
he
realized
very
suddenly
that
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
somewhere
during
the
meeting
he
was
he
told
himself
definitely
sane
that
left
another
conclusion
he
was
not
dreaming
anything
that
was
happening
it
was
all
perfectly
real
and
he
was
about
to
become
a
that
in
itself
did
sound
so
bad
but
he
began
to
wonder
in
a
quiet
sort
of
way
just
what
was
going
to
happen
to
william
forrester
acolyte
and
history
professor
when
had
became
a
reality
with
a
blunt
shock
he
knew
that
there
was
only
one
answer
william
forrester
was
going
to
die
it
did
matter
what
the
verdict
of
the
gods
was
there
were
more
tests
coming
he
knew
and
if
he
failed
them
the
gods
would
kill
him
quite
literally
and
quite
completely
but
he
went
on
suppose
he
passed
the
tests
in
that
case
he
was
going
to
become
a
substitute
god
plain
old
bill
forrester
would
cease
to
exist
entirely
oh
a
few
traces
might
remain
his
beta
curve
for
instance
whatever
that
was
but
bill
forrester
would
be
gone
somehow
the
idea
of
a
revenant
beta
curve
did
make
up
for
the
basic
loss
on
the
other
hand
he
reminded
himself
again
what
choice
did
he
have
none
he
forced
himself
to
listen
to
what
the
gods
were
saying
zeus
cleared
his
throat
well
i
think
that
closes
the
subject
am
i
right
dear
you
are
hera
said
very
well
zeus
said
then
the
subject
is
closed
is
it
hera
nodded
wearily
in
that
case
we
can
proceed
with
the
investiture
hephaestus
will
you
please
take
charge
of
the
candidate
sighed
softly
i
suppose
i
must
he
swung
off
the
couch
and
stood
for
a
second
forrester
looked
at
him
blankly
well
vulcan
said
come
on
he
jerked
his
head
toward
forrester
over
here
with
one
last
backward
glance
at
venus
forrester
walked
across
the
room
vulcan
turned
and
hobbled
ahead
of
him
toward
the
wall
forrester
followed
until
almost
at
the
wall
a
veil
of
heaven
appeared
feeling
almost
used
to
the
thing
by
now
forrester
followed
vulcan
through
and
he
did
even
look
behind
him
to
see
if
the
veil
had
vanished
after
they
come
through
he
knew
perfectly
well
it
had
it
always
did
the
room
they
had
entered
was
similar
to
the
others
he
had
seen
but
there
was
no
change
of
colors
the
walls
glowed
evenly
and
with
a
subdued
light
that
filled
the
room
evenly
and
for
the
first
time
the
walls
were
simply
blanks
that
became
things
only
when
approached
the
objects
forrester
had
ever
seen
filled
benches
tables
chairs
and
the
floor
and
some
were
even
tacked
to
the
glowing
walls
he
stared
at
them
for
a
long
time
no
two
were
alike
they
seemed
to
be
all
sizes
shapes
and
materials
the
only
thing
they
really
had
in
common
was
that
they
were
unrecognizable
they
looked
forrester
thought
as
if
a
truckload
of
sculpture
had
collided
with
another
truck
full
of
old
innards
then
in
some
way
the
two
trucks
had
fallen
in
love
and
had
children
the
scrambled
horrors
scattered
throughout
the
room
were
forrester
told
himself
bleakly
the
children
vulcan
sat
down
on
the
only
empty
chair
with
a
sigh
this
is
my
workshop
he
announced
gravely
it
is
not
arranged
for
visitors
nor
for
the
curious
i
must
advise
you
to
touch
nothing
if
you
wish
to
save
your
hands
your
sanity
and
very
possibly
your
life
forrester
nodded
dumbly
vulcan
tone
had
been
unfriendly
he
had
merely
been
warning
a
stranger
in
the
shortest
and
clearest
manner
possible
against
the
dangers
of
feeling
the
merchandise
not
forrester
thought
that
the
warning
was
necessary
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
trying
to
fly
as
he
would
of
touching
one
of
the
looking
things
now
vulcan
said
if
you
he
stopped
pardon
me
he
said
and
levered
himself
upright
he
went
to
a
chair
swept
a
few
constructions
from
it
and
put
them
carefully
on
a
table
sit
down
he
said
motioning
to
the
chair
gingerly
forrester
sat
down
vulcan
returned
to
his
own
chair
and
climbed
onto
it
now
let
us
get
to
business
business
forrester
said
oh
yes
vulcan
said
i
imagine
you
were
pretty
well
bewildered
for
a
while
no
more
than
natural
but
i
think
you
figured
it
out
by
now
you
know
you
are
going
to
be
given
the
powers
of
a
do
you
yes
but
do
not
worry
about
it
vulcan
said
the
powers
are
simply
powers
they
are
not
burdens
at
any
rate
they
will
not
be
burdensome
to
you
we
know
that
we
have
researched
you
to
a
fine
point
as
you
may
have
gathered
from
the
back
there
he
gestured
toward
his
right
evidently
indicating
the
court
of
the
gods
but
forrester
said
suppose
i
not
what
your
tests
say
i
mean
suppose
i
there
is
no
need
for
supposition
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
we
know
how
you
as
a
mortal
will
react
to
any
conceivable
set
of
circumstances
oh
forrester
said
but
precisely
you
have
realized
what
yet
needs
to
be
done
we
know
what
your
abilities
and
limitations
are
a
the
tests
you
have
yet
to
pass
are
concerned
with
your
actions
and
reactions
as
a
forrester
swallowed
hard
he
felt
as
if
he
were
on
a
moving
no
matter
how
badly
he
wanted
to
get
off
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
he
had
to
remain
while
the
car
hurtled
on
and
where
was
he
going
the
gods
he
told
himself
with
more
than
ordinary
meaning
knew
the
power
which
is
to
be
infused
into
you
vulcan
said
if
you
mind
the
loose
terminology
i
do
mind
in
the
least
forrester
assured
him
earnestly
not
in
the
least
the
power
infused
into
you
will
make
some
changes
these
will
not
only
be
physical
changes
mental
changes
must
be
expected
oh
forrester
said
mental
changes
correct
physically
you
see
you
will
become
what
no
mortal
can
ever
quite
be
a
perfectly
functioning
biological
engine
every
sinew
nerve
and
muscle
every
organ
and
gland
every
tissue
in
your
body
will
be
in
perfect
harmonic
balance
with
every
other
metabolically
speaking
your
catabolism
and
anabolism
will
be
in
such
perfect
balance
that
aging
will
not
be
possible
forrester
thought
that
over
i
be
immortal
he
said
in
that
sense
of
the
word
vulcan
said
you
will
you
will
be
as
a
matter
of
fact
quite
a
good
deal
tougher
stronger
and
harder
than
any
animal
now
existing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
must
except
of
course
a
few
of
the
really
big
ones
like
the
elephant
and
the
killer
whale
oh
forrester
said
sure
but
make
no
mistake
you
can
still
be
killed
a
bullet
through
the
heart
will
not
do
the
job
it
will
merely
incapacitate
you
for
a
few
hours
but
if
you
were
to
have
your
head
blown
off
by
a
grenade
you
would
be
quite
dead
remember
that
i
do
see
how
i
could
forget
it
you
will
heal
with
incredible
rapidity
but
there
are
limitations
anything
that
pushes
the
balance
too
far
will
be
fatal
you
can
lose
a
hand
or
even
an
arm
without
serious
harm
the
missing
member
will
be
regrown
but
if
you
were
to
fall
into
a
large
i
get
the
idea
forrester
said
feeling
pale
green
good
vulcan
said
however
there
is
more
there
are
certain
other
powers
to
be
given
you
in
addition
you
will
learn
of
these
later
forrester
nodded
blankly
now
vulcan
said
all
these
physical
changes
will
have
a
definite
effect
upon
your
psychological
outlook
as
i
imagine
you
can
plainly
see
forrester
thought
about
it
well
let
us
suppose
that
you
are
a
coward
who
has
avoided
fights
all
his
life
now
you
are
given
these
powers
what
will
happen
i
be
strong
exactly
you
will
be
strong
and
because
you
are
strong
and
almost
indestructible
you
suddenly
decide
that
you
can
now
get
your
revenge
on
the
people
who
have
pushed
you
around
well
forrester
said
i
you
begin
to
look
for
fights
vulcan
said
you
go
around
beating
up
everyone
you
can
find
simply
because
you
now
know
you
can
get
away
with
it
do
you
understand
me
i
guess
so
a
man
with
a
vicious
streak
in
him
would
be
intolerable
in
this
position
can
you
see
that
take
an
example
ares
mars
is
a
tough
god
hard
and
at
times
brutal
but
he
is
not
vicious
forrester
was
a
little
surprised
to
hear
vulcan
say
anything
nice
about
mars
he
knew
as
everyone
did
the
long
history
of
and
positive
hatred
the
two
had
built
up
between
them
it
had
begun
soon
after
vulcan
marriage
to
he
had
been
a
cripple
then
of
course
for
a
while
he
and
venus
had
had
a
fine
time
but
venus
apparently
just
was
satisfied
with
the
dull
normal
routine
of
married
life
none
of
the
gods
seemed
to
be
as
a
matter
of
fact
either
they
were
altogether
too
married
like
zeus
or
else
they
were
married
enough
like
venus
or
else
they
were
like
diana
and
athena
indifferent
to
marriage
at
any
rate
venus
had
begun
looking
around
for
fresh
talent
and
the
fresh
talent
had
been
right
there
ready
to
sign
up
for
a
long
contract
on
a
strictly
basis
one
day
vulcan
caught
them
at
it
his
wife
and
mars
vulcan
was
angry
but
mars
did
exactly
like
to
be
interrupted
either
and
he
was
a
little
faster
on
the
draw
he
tossed
vulcan
over
a
nearby
cliff
crippling
him
for
good
and
as
for
aphrodite
who
knew
it
was
entirely
possible
that
by
this
time
the
goddess
of
love
had
run
through
the
entire
list
of
gods
and
was
now
at
work
on
the
mortals
forrester
was
entirely
sure
he
disliked
the
idea
on
a
simple
physical
level
but
there
was
more
than
that
to
it
of
course
there
was
vulcan
forrester
found
himself
liking
the
solemn
positive
workman
he
did
want
to
hurt
him
and
a
liaison
with
venus
was
certain
to
do
just
that
he
came
back
to
the
present
to
hear
vulcan
still
discoursing
also
the
god
said
changes
in
glandular
balance
must
be
made
these
changes
have
a
necessary
effect
on
the
brain
the
personality
changes
subtly
though
i
can
assure
you
that
the
change
is
not
a
marked
one
he
paused
for
all
these
reasons
he
finished
i
am
sure
that
you
can
see
why
we
must
subject
you
to
further
tests
i
understand
forrester
said
vaguely
good
now
you
will
not
know
whether
a
given
incident
any
given
incident
is
a
perfectly
natural
occurrence
or
a
test
imposed
on
you
by
the
pantheon
can
you
understand
that
forrester
nodded
vulcan
levered
himself
upright
his
ugly
face
smiling
just
a
little
and
remember
what
i
have
told
you
no
worrying
you
do
even
know
just
what
any
given
test
is
supposed
to
accomplish
so
you
ca
know
whether
the
action
you
choose
is
right
or
wrong
therefore
worrying
will
do
nothing
for
you
you
will
be
at
your
best
if
you
simply
behave
naturally
i
try
remember
also
that
you
were
picked
not
merely
for
your
physical
resemblance
to
dionysus
but
your
psychological
resemblance
as
well
therefore
playing
his
part
should
be
comparatively
simple
for
you
right
i
guess
so
forrester
said
feeling
both
expectant
and
a
little
hopeless
about
it
all
fine
vulcan
said
now
wait
one
moment
he
turned
and
limped
over
to
a
structure
that
looked
like
a
sort
of
worktable
when
he
came
back
he
was
carrying
several
objects
in
his
big
hands
he
selected
one
an
ovoid
about
the
size
of
a
marble
colored
a
dull
orange
and
handed
it
to
forrester
swallow
that
forrester
took
it
cautiously
as
soon
as
he
found
out
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
with
the
thing
its
dimensions
seemed
to
grow
it
looked
about
the
size
of
a
golf
ball
in
his
shaking
hands
it
he
said
tentatively
correct
vulcan
said
but
this
object
is
a
well
call
it
a
talisman
it
will
not
dissolve
and
it
is
recoverable
but
for
the
investiture
it
must
be
inside
you
but
you
will
find
it
so
easy
to
swallow
that
you
will
need
no
water
go
ahead
forrester
put
the
thing
in
his
mouth
and
swallowed
once
just
to
test
vulcan
statement
the
effect
was
surprising
he
could
barely
feel
it
leave
his
tongue
and
he
could
feel
it
go
down
at
all
he
swallowed
again
experimentally
and
explored
the
inside
of
his
mouth
with
his
tongue
it
is
gone
vulcan
said
good
it
gone
all
right
forrester
said
wonderingly
the
sandals
are
next
vulcan
selected
a
pair
of
sandals
with
rather
thick
soles
and
handed
them
over
they
were
apparently
made
of
gold
forrester
obediently
strapped
them
on
and
vulcan
next
handed
him
a
pair
of
golden
cylinders
indented
to
fit
his
curved
fingers
you
hold
these
very
tightly
vulcan
said
during
the
investiture
you
must
grip
them
as
hard
as
you
can
he
peered
closely
at
them
and
pointed
to
one
this
one
goes
in
the
left
hand
the
other
goes
in
the
right
squeeze
them
as
if
as
if
you
were
trying
to
crush
them
all
right
all
right
forrester
said
vulcan
nodded
good
from
this
moment
on
do
exactly
as
you
are
told
answer
questions
truthfully
keep
nothing
secret
remember
my
instructions
right
forrester
said
doubtfully
come
on
vulcan
said
heading
for
the
wall
the
inevitable
veil
of
heaven
appeared
and
forrester
followed
through
it
as
before
the
room
they
entered
was
not
he
thought
the
same
one
they
had
been
in
before
or
if
it
was
it
had
changed
a
great
deal
it
was
difficult
to
tell
anything
for
sure
the
shifting
walls
looked
the
same
but
they
also
looked
like
the
shifting
walls
in
venus
apartments
at
any
rate
there
were
now
no
couches
on
the
floor
the
room
seemed
even
bigger
than
before
and
when
the
walls
settled
down
to
a
steady
golden
glow
forrester
felt
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
place
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
raised
golden
dais
it
was
about
five
feet
across
and
nearly
three
feet
high
the
gods
were
ranged
around
it
in
a
semicircle
facing
him
vulcan
slipped
into
an
empty
space
in
the
line
and
forrester
stood
perfectly
alone
holding
the
cylinders
zeus
cleared
his
throat
step
up
on
the
dais
he
said
stumbling
slightly
forrester
managed
to
do
so
without
losing
his
grip
on
the
cylinders
in
the
center
of
the
raised
platform
with
the
gods
staring
at
him
he
felt
like
something
under
a
microscope
william
forrester
zeus
said
and
he
shuddered
the
voice
had
never
been
more
powerful
william
forrester
from
this
moment
onward
you
will
renounce
your
present
name
you
will
be
known
as
dionysus
the
lesser
until
and
unless
it
shall
please
us
to
confer
another
name
on
you
henceforth
you
will
be
in
part
a
recipient
of
the
worship
due
to
dionysus
and
you
will
hold
the
rank
of
do
you
accept
these
judgments
and
this
honor
forrester
gulped
a
long
time
seemed
to
pass
at
last
he
found
his
voice
i
do
he
said
very
well
zeus
said
the
gods
joined
hands
and
closed
the
circle
around
forrester
surrounding
him
completely
the
golden
auras
that
shone
about
their
bodies
grew
more
and
more
bright
forrester
clutched
the
golden
cylinders
tightly
then
very
suddenly
there
was
an
explosion
of
light
forrester
thought
he
had
staggered
but
he
was
never
sure
everything
was
too
bright
to
see
dizziness
began
and
grew
the
room
whirled
and
tipped
somewhere
a
great
organlike
note
began
and
went
on
and
on
forrester
convulsed
with
the
force
of
a
single
great
burst
of
energy
that
crashed
through
his
nervous
system
and
then
in
a
timeless
instant
everything
went
black
chapter
seven
the
morning
of
the
autumn
bacchanal
dawned
bright
and
clear
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
the
pantheon
in
new
york
the
leaves
were
only
just
beginning
to
turn
and
the
sun
was
still
high
enough
in
the
sky
to
make
the
afternoons
warm
and
pleasant
zeus
had
promised
good
weather
for
the
festival
and
a
strong
warm
wind
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
moving
out
the
crisp
autumn
air
before
the
sun
had
risen
an
hour
above
the
horizon
the
practicing
that
had
gone
on
in
thousands
of
homes
throughout
the
city
was
at
an
end
the
autumn
bacchanal
was
here
at
last
and
the
beginning
service
which
had
started
in
the
little
right
at
dawn
when
the
sun
rays
had
first
touched
the
tops
of
new
york
towers
was
approaching
its
end
the
people
clustered
in
the
building
and
the
incomparably
greater
number
scattered
outside
it
were
feeling
the
first
itch
of
restlessness
soon
the
grand
procession
would
begin
starting
as
always
from
the
and
wending
its
slow
way
northward
to
the
upper
end
of
central
park
at
street
then
the
string
of
worshippers
would
turn
and
head
back
for
the
temple
at
the
lower
end
of
the
park
with
fanfare
and
pageantry
on
a
scale
calculated
to
do
honor
to
the
god
of
the
festival
to
outshine
not
only
every
other
festival
but
every
past
year
of
the
autumn
bacchanal
itself
the
autumn
bacchanal
was
devoted
to
the
celebration
of
the
harvest
and
more
specifically
the
harvest
and
processing
of
the
grape
all
the
wineries
for
hundreds
of
miles
around
had
shipped
hogshead
after
hogshead
and
barrel
after
barrel
of
fine
wine
red
white
rose
still
or
sparkling
as
joyous
sacrifice
to
and
in
thanks
that
the
fertility
rites
of
the
vernal
bacchanal
had
brought
them
good
crops
wine
flowed
from
everywhere
into
the
city
and
now
the
immense
reserves
were
stacked
away
awaiting
the
revels
even
the
brewers
and
distillers
had
sent
along
their
wares
from
the
mildest
beer
to
vodka
of
proof
joining
unselfishly
in
the
celebration
even
though
technically
they
were
not
under
dionysian
protection
at
all
but
were
the
wards
of
ceres
the
goddess
of
grain
celebrants
liquors
chants
preparations
balloons
confetti
edibles
and
all
the
other
appurtenances
of
the
festival
spiraled
dizzyingly
upward
reaching
proportions
unheard
of
throughout
history
and
in
a
back
room
at
the
the
late
william
forrester
sat
trying
to
forget
all
about
them
and
suffering
from
a
continuous
case
of
nerves
diana
marched
up
and
down
in
front
of
him
smacking
her
left
fist
into
her
calloused
little
right
palm
now
listen
she
said
crisply
i
know
you
all
hot
and
bothered
kid
but
there
no
reason
to
be
doing
fine
they
love
you
out
there
sure
i
am
forrester
said
unconvinced
well
you
are
diana
said
you
just
got
to
have
confidence
all
keep
your
spirits
up
tried
singing
singing
singing
kid
raises
the
spirits
forrester
blinked
really
take
it
from
me
diana
said
how
about
tenting
tonight
how
about
what
tenting
tonight
diana
said
you
know
i
guess
i
do
forrester
wished
that
diana
would
do
more
than
treat
him
like
a
pal
she
was
a
remarkably
beautiful
woman
if
you
liked
the
type
and
forrester
liked
virtually
any
type
now
success
appeared
to
be
within
his
grasp
but
it
did
seem
an
odd
time
to
bring
the
subject
up
oh
well
he
thought
maybe
she
was
just
trying
to
cheer
him
up
and
had
picked
this
way
of
doing
it
it
worked
too
he
told
himself
happily
he
cleared
his
throat
where
diana
stared
where
that
right
forrester
said
something
was
going
wrong
but
he
could
discover
what
it
was
the
tenting
oh
diana
said
right
here
now
raises
the
spirits
i
should
say
it
does
forrester
agreed
enthusiastically
but
after
all
right
here
do
worry
about
it
kid
nobody
will
hear
you
me
anyway
it
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
lots
of
people
do
it
when
they
feel
low
i
bet
they
do
forrester
said
but
it
different
with
you
and
me
me
diana
said
what
do
i
have
to
do
with
it
i
just
told
you
well
sure
and
here
and
now
is
as
good
a
time
and
place
as
any
diana
stepped
back
a
pace
okay
let
hear
it
sing
sing
you
mean
i
have
to
sing
for
my
i
join
you
diana
said
forrester
nodded
he
was
beginning
to
get
confused
you
better
he
said
tonight
on
the
old
camp
she
sang
now
come
on
forrester
coughed
oh
he
said
sing
sure
diana
said
and
they
went
through
the
song
together
how
about
another
chorus
she
asked
it
all
right
diana
forrester
said
knowing
she
preferred
the
name
to
her
greek
one
of
artemis
i
feel
fine
now
well
diana
said
in
a
disappointed
voice
all
right
what
surprised
forrester
most
was
that
he
feel
fine
all
the
gods
had
helped
him
in
the
past
several
months
but
diana
had
been
especially
helpful
as
a
forest
goddess
and
as
protectress
of
the
night
been
able
to
tell
him
a
lot
about
how
an
orgy
was
arranged
he
had
often
wished
that
she
would
teach
by
example
but
now
he
discovered
it
was
too
late
for
wishing
she
was
he
told
himself
with
only
faint
regret
just
like
a
sister
to
him
or
even
a
brother
i
guess
everything
will
be
okay
he
said
wo
it
diana
clapped
him
on
the
back
you
going
to
be
great
just
go
out
there
and
show
what
kind
of
a
god
you
are
but
what
kind
of
a
god
am
i
just
keep
cool
kid
you
wo
fail
me
i
know
it
i
try
forrester
said
only
i
getting
nervous
just
sitting
around
here
i
wish
we
could
go
out
and
stroll
around
we
got
plenty
of
time
anyhow
diana
nodded
it
ten
minutes
yet
before
the
procession
starts
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
take
a
look
around
kid
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
it
might
fine
then
but
how
do
you
want
to
go
forrester
blinked
how
invisibility
diana
said
or
incognito
oh
forrester
said
then
he
added
you
asking
me
of
course
i
am
kid
now
look
this
is
your
celebration
remember
you
dionysus
got
it
even
in
my
presence
you
act
the
part
now
you
ought
to
know
that
well
sure
but
keep
this
in
mind
these
people
have
had
a
sabbatical
bacchanal
in
seven
years
every
seven
years
they
get
to
see
their
god
and
this
year
you
it
right
i
guess
so
but
no
buts
diana
said
you
the
boss
and
they
your
worshippers
that
all
there
is
to
it
now
you
got
to
make
up
your
mind
it
be
forrester
thought
well
he
said
at
last
i
guess
it
had
better
be
incognito
with
this
crowd
there
too
much
likelihood
of
getting
bumped
into
if
we
invisible
right
diana
grinned
that
the
boy
you
thinking
straight
now
forrester
had
the
sudden
feeling
that
he
had
just
passed
another
test
but
he
did
quite
dare
ask
about
it
all
right
he
said
instead
let
go
he
put
his
mind
to
work
concentrating
on
the
special
faculties
that
his
power
gave
him
his
face
began
to
change
he
looked
less
and
less
like
dionysus
as
the
seconds
went
by
and
more
and
more
like
william
forrester
at
the
same
time
the
golden
aura
around
his
body
began
to
fade
after
a
few
minutes
he
looked
like
william
forrester
completely
a
nice
enough
guy
but
pretty
much
of
a
nonentity
diana
with
the
greater
power
of
a
true
goddess
achieved
the
same
sort
of
result
almost
instantly
her
aura
was
gone
and
the
sparkle
had
left
her
eyes
her
brown
hair
looked
a
little
mousy
now
and
her
face
was
merely
pretty
instead
of
being
gloriously
beautiful
just
one
thing
forrester
said
we
better
make
ourselves
invisible
just
to
leave
the
temple
somebody
might
suspect
we
were
ordinary
people
at
all
right
again
diana
smiled
she
nodded
her
head
and
blinked
out
forrester
could
still
see
a
cloudy
outline
of
her
in
the
room
but
he
knew
that
was
because
he
was
a
with
special
powers
an
ordinary
mortal
he
knew
would
see
nothing
at
all
he
followed
her
into
invisibility
and
walked
out
the
back
door
of
the
the
door
was
open
and
two
temple
myrmidons
wearing
the
golden
of
dionysus
on
their
shoulder
patches
stood
outside
the
door
neither
of
them
saw
forrester
and
diana
leave
three
minutes
later
they
were
standing
near
the
doorway
of
the
temple
watching
the
preparations
for
the
grand
procession
the
fifty
priests
of
dionysus
gathered
there
while
the
enormous
crowd
pushed
and
shoved
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
ritual
the
sacrifice
of
the
first
fruits
had
been
completed
and
now
at
the
door
of
the
temple
each
of
the
fifty
priests
filled
a
chalice
from
a
huge
hogshead
of
purple
wine
they
chanted
a
prayer
in
unison
and
spilled
half
the
wine
on
the
ground
as
a
libation
then
they
lifted
the
chalices
to
their
lips
and
drank
finishing
the
other
half
in
one
long
motion
the
chalices
were
set
down
and
a
cheer
rose
from
the
crowd
the
bacchanal
had
begun
the
priests
separated
into
two
equal
groups
of
them
started
northward
marching
to
their
positions
at
regularly
spaced
intervals
in
the
procession
the
remaining
stayed
behind
ready
to
accompany
dionysus
himself
at
the
tail
of
the
parade
each
of
the
other
gods
was
represented
by
a
special
detachment
of
ten
myrmidons
each
contingent
wearing
the
distinctive
shoulder
patch
of
the
god
it
served
the
thunderbolt
of
zeus
the
blazing
sun
of
apollo
the
pipes
of
pan
the
sword
of
mars
the
hammer
of
vulcan
the
poppy
of
morpheus
the
winged
foot
of
mercury
the
trident
of
neptune
the
cerberus
of
pluto
the
peacock
of
hera
the
owl
of
athena
the
dove
of
venus
the
crescent
of
diana
and
the
sprig
of
wheat
that
represented
mother
ceres
the
myrmidons
grinned
in
expectation
of
the
good
times
coming
a
dionysian
festival
was
always
something
special
and
competition
for
the
contingents
was
always
tough
there
were
balloons
everywhere
as
the
crowd
shoved
and
pushed
into
the
line
of
march
someone
was
bawling
an
old
song
about
the
lack
of
liquor
and
the
strident
voice
carried
over
the
shouts
and
halloos
of
the
mob
dry
i
am
forrester
and
diana
now
visible
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowds
a
man
flung
his
arm
around
the
goddess
with
abandon
shouting
something
indistinguishable
diana
shook
him
off
gently
and
went
on
forrester
almost
tripped
over
a
small
boy
sitting
on
the
grass
and
crying
a
myrmidon
was
standing
over
him
and
the
child
mother
was
trying
to
lift
the
boy
i
wan
na
go
to
the
orgy
the
boy
kept
saying
i
wan
na
go
to
the
orgy
next
year
the
mother
told
him
next
year
child
when
you
six
the
myrmidon
lifted
the
child
and
carried
him
away
the
mother
shouted
an
address
after
him
and
the
myrmidon
nodded
pushed
his
way
through
a
gesticulating
group
of
celebrants
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
central
park
west
there
other
dionysian
myrmidons
were
patrolling
making
sure
that
no
got
in
except
by
special
invitation
any
who
wanted
to
celebrate
was
supposed
to
do
it
on
the
streets
of
the
city
and
not
in
central
park
which
was
going
to
be
crowded
enough
with
legitimate
revelers
the
shouting
and
screaming
went
on
people
pushing
and
shoving
confetti
beginning
to
drift
like
a
light
snow
over
the
worshippers
one
man
held
five
balloons
and
a
cigarette
and
he
was
popping
the
balloons
with
the
cigarette
tip
one
by
one
every
time
one
of
the
balloons
exploded
a
group
of
women
and
girls
around
him
shrieked
and
laughed
forrester
turned
back
behind
a
convenient
bush
he
and
diana
made
themselves
invisible
again
and
the
the
silence
inside
the
temple
was
deafening
the
noise
out
there
could
break
eardrums
forrester
complained
never
heard
anything
like
it
just
wait
diana
told
him
the
music
will
start
any
time
now
and
then
you
hear
something
she
paused
ready
forrester
glanced
down
at
himself
i
guess
so
how
do
i
look
he
had
constructed
a
golden
and
mentally
clothed
himself
in
it
it
was
covered
by
a
cloak
embroidered
with
golden
grapevines
and
around
his
head
a
circlet
of
woven
grapevines
had
appeared
made
of
solid
gold
it
was
a
little
heavier
than
forrester
had
expected
it
would
be
but
it
lent
him
he
thought
rather
a
dashing
air
great
diana
said
just
great
think
so
forrester
said
feeling
rather
pleased
sure
you
do
now
go
out
there
and
give
the
old
college
try
forrester
gulped
how
about
you
me
i
on
my
way
out
of
here
this
is
your
show
kid
make
the
most
of
it
forrester
watched
her
go
out
the
rear
door
he
was
alone
and
the
autumn
bacchanal
processional
was
about
to
begin
chapter
eight
noise
forrester
seated
in
the
great
golden
palanquin
supported
by
twelve
hefty
priests
of
dionysus
had
never
seen
or
heard
anything
like
it
he
waited
there
on
the
steps
of
the
little
for
the
procession
to
wind
by
so
that
he
could
take
his
place
at
the
end
of
it
but
the
procession
looked
endless
first
came
a
corps
of
priests
and
myrmidons
leading
their
way
stolidly
through
the
paths
of
central
park
following
them
came
the
revelers
a
mass
of
men
and
women
marching
laughing
singing
shouting
dancing
their
way
along
to
the
accompaniment
of
more
music
than
forrester
had
ever
dreamed
of
the
dionysians
had
practiced
for
months
and
almost
everything
was
represented
there
were
violinists
prancing
along
violists
and
a
crew
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
playing
the
viol
da
gamba
and
the
viol
there
were
guitarists
plunking
madly
away
banjo
players
strumming
and
ukelele
addicts
picking
at
their
strings
somehow
all
chorusing
together
in
a
special
pair
of
floats
there
were
bass
players
bass
fiddle
players
and
cellists
jammed
tightly
together
and
somehow
managing
to
draw
enormous
sounds
and
scratches
out
of
the
big
instruments
and
behind
them
came
the
main
band
of
musicians
the
woodwinds
followed
piccolo
players
piping
flutists
fluting
oboe
players
and
concentrating
on
making
the
most
piercing
possible
sounds
men
playing
english
horns
clarinets
bass
clarinets
bassoons
and
along
with
men
playing
serpents
and
behind
them
a
dancing
group
fingering
ocarinas
and
adding
their
bit
to
the
general
tumult
and
two
women
tootling
madly
away
on
zootibars
and
then
near
the
center
of
the
musicians
were
the
brass
trumpets
and
trombones
and
valve
trombones
and
fulk
horns
all
blatting
away
to
split
the
sky
with
maddening
sound
sousaphones
and
saxophones
and
french
horns
and
bass
horns
and
hunting
horns
and
tubas
along
in
their
own
little
cart
six
men
lost
in
the
curves
of
the
great
instruments
valiantly
blowing
away
as
they
rolled
by
into
the
woods
of
the
park
making
the
city
itself
resound
with
tremendous
noise
and
shattering
cadence
and
behind
them
was
the
battery
kettle
drums
bass
drums
xylophones
chinese
gongs
vibraphones
snare
drums
and
cymbals
paraded
by
in
carts
banged
and
stroked
and
tinkled
enthusiastically
by
crew
after
crew
of
maddened
tympanists
and
then
came
the
others
on
foot
tambourines
and
wood
blocks
and
parade
cymbals
and
castanets
at
the
tail
of
this
portion
of
the
procession
came
a
single
old
man
wearing
spectacles
and
riding
in
a
small
cart
drawn
by
a
donkey
he
had
white
hair
and
he
was
playing
on
a
series
of
filled
to
various
levels
his
ear
was
cocked
toward
the
glasses
with
painstaking
care
he
was
entirely
inaudible
in
the
general
din
but
he
looked
happy
and
satisfied
he
was
doing
his
bit
after
him
followed
a
group
of
entirely
naked
men
and
women
playing
sackbuts
and
another
group
playing
recorders
bringing
up
the
rear
as
the
procession
curved
was
a
magnificent
aggregation
of
men
and
women
yowling
away
on
bagpipes
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
all
of
the
men
wore
sporrans
and
nothing
more
the
women
wore
nothing
at
all
the
music
that
emanated
from
this
group
was
enough
to
unhinge
the
mind
and
then
came
the
keyboard
instruments
into
the
middle
of
which
the
five
had
been
stuck
for
no
reason
at
all
the
strange
howls
of
this
unearthly
instrument
filtered
through
the
sound
of
pianos
harpsichords
psalters
clavichords
virginals
and
three
gigantic
electric
organs
pumping
at
full
strength
and
bringing
up
the
very
rear
of
the
procession
was
a
special
decorated
cart
full
of
color
and
holding
a
lone
man
with
long
white
hair
wearing
a
rusty
black
suit
and
playing
away
with
great
attention
and
care
on
the
largest
steam
calliope
forrester
had
ever
met
jets
of
steam
fizzed
out
of
the
top
and
music
bawled
from
the
interior
of
the
massive
thing
as
it
went
by
trailing
the
procession
into
the
woods
and
the
entire
aggregation
swung
into
a
single
song
hundred
upon
hundreds
of
musicians
and
singers
all
coming
down
hard
on
the
opening
strains
of
the
hymn
to
dionysus
eyes
have
seen
the
glory
of
the
lord
who
rules
the
wine
he
has
trampled
out
the
vintage
of
the
grapes
upon
the
vine
the
twelve
priests
picked
up
the
palanquin
and
forrester
adjusted
his
weight
so
they
would
find
it
too
heavy
it
was
impossible
to
think
in
the
mass
of
noise
and
music
that
went
on
and
on
as
the
procession
wound
uptown
through
the
paths
of
central
park
and
the
musicians
banged
and
scraped
and
blew
and
pounded
and
stroked
and
plucked
and
the
great
hymn
rose
into
the
air
filling
the
entire
city
with
the
bawled
chorus
as
even
the
twelve
priests
joined
in
adding
to
the
din
glory
dionysus
glory
glory
dionysus
glory
glory
dionysus
while
his
wine
goes
flowing
on
forrester
had
always
been
disturbed
by
what
he
thought
might
have
been
a
double
meaning
in
that
last
line
but
it
did
disturb
him
now
nothing
seemed
to
disturb
him
as
the
procession
wound
on
and
he
was
laughing
uproariously
and
winking
and
nodding
at
his
worshippers
as
they
sang
and
played
all
around
him
and
the
hours
went
by
halfway
there
he
fished
in
the
air
and
brought
down
the
small
golden
disks
with
the
picture
of
dionysus
on
them
that
were
a
regular
feature
of
the
processional
and
flung
them
happily
into
the
crowd
ahead
only
one
was
allowed
per
person
so
there
was
not
much
scrambling
but
some
of
the
coins
pattered
down
on
the
various
instruments
and
one
landed
in
the
old
gentleman
water
glass
and
had
to
be
fished
out
before
he
could
go
on
with
the
hymn
carousing
and
noisy
the
procession
finally
reached
the
huge
stand
at
the
far
end
of
the
park
and
the
music
stopped
on
the
stand
was
a
whole
new
group
of
musicians
harpists
lyrists
players
of
the
flageolet
and
dulcimer
two
men
sweating
over
glockenspiels
a
group
equipped
with
zithers
and
citharas
and
sitars
three
women
playing
two
men
with
shofars
and
a
tall
blond
man
playing
a
clarino
trumpet
as
the
procession
ground
to
a
halt
this
new
band
struck
up
the
hymn
again
played
it
through
twice
and
then
stopped
seven
girls
filed
out
onto
the
platform
in
front
of
the
musicians
one
was
there
representing
every
year
since
the
last
sabbatical
bacchanal
forrester
riding
high
on
the
palanquin
beamed
down
at
them
roaring
with
happy
laughter
they
were
all
for
him
having
been
carried
to
one
end
of
the
park
in
triumph
he
was
now
to
march
back
at
the
head
of
his
people
surrounded
by
seven
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
in
new
york
their
final
selection
had
been
left
he
knew
to
a
brewery
which
had
experience
in
these
matters
and
the
girls
certainly
looked
like
the
pick
of
anybody
crop
forrester
beamed
at
them
again
stood
up
in
the
palanquin
and
spread
his
arms
wide
then
he
sprang
in
a
flying
leap
he
went
high
into
the
air
and
did
a
full
somersault
landing
on
his
toes
on
the
stage
feet
away
the
girls
were
kneeling
in
a
circle
around
him
come
my
doves
he
bellowed
come
my
pigeons
his
godlike
golden
baritone
carried
for
blocks
he
grabbed
the
two
nearest
girls
by
their
hands
and
helped
them
to
their
feet
they
blushed
and
lowered
their
eyes
come
all
of
you
forrester
shouted
we
are
about
to
begin
the
revels
the
girls
rose
and
forrester
gestured
them
in
closer
then
surrounded
by
all
seven
he
threw
back
his
head
again
a
revel
to
make
history
he
roared
a
revel
beyond
the
imagination
of
man
a
revel
fit
for
your
god
the
crowd
cheered
wildly
forrester
picked
up
one
of
the
girls
tossed
her
into
the
air
and
caught
her
easily
as
she
descended
he
set
her
on
her
feet
and
put
his
hands
solidly
on
his
hips
my
cup
he
shouted
fill
you
my
cup
behind
the
stage
was
a
corps
of
priests
guarding
a
mountainous
golden
hogshead
of
wine
adjudged
the
finest
wine
produced
during
the
year
we
shall
have
drink
forrester
shouted
we
shall
let
the
revels
roar
on
two
priests
came
forward
staggering
under
the
weight
of
a
gigantic
crystal
goblet
containing
fully
two
gallons
of
the
clear
purple
liquid
they
bore
it
to
forrester
with
great
pomp
and
before
them
came
a
dozen
players
on
the
gahoon
and
the
making
forrester
ears
ring
with
deafening
fanfares
forrester
took
the
great
goblet
in
one
hand
and
held
it
with
ease
then
he
lifted
it
into
the
air
with
a
wordless
shout
filled
his
lungs
and
laughed
he
put
the
goblet
to
his
lips
and
drained
it
in
a
single
long
motion
a
mighty
hurrah
shook
the
trees
and
rocks
of
the
park
forrester
waved
the
goblet
again
fill
you
my
cup
once
more
he
embraced
the
seven
girls
with
one
sweeping
gesture
of
his
arms
my
little
beauties
must
have
drink
fill
you
the
cup
he
passed
it
back
to
the
priests
carefully
they
received
it
and
went
back
to
where
the
others
were
waiting
to
fill
it
then
they
staggered
forward
again
and
forrester
picked
up
the
brimming
goblet
he
held
it
for
the
girls
each
of
whom
tried
to
outdrink
the
others
but
it
was
still
more
than
when
they
were
finished
forrester
raised
it
again
the
crowd
shouted
observe
your
god
forrester
roared
observe
his
powers
he
threw
his
head
back
and
emptied
the
goblet
then
holding
it
in
one
hand
he
faced
the
assemblage
and
delivered
himself
of
one
godlike
belch
the
crowd
shrieked
its
approval
forrester
had
the
goblet
filled
once
more
and
put
three
of
the
girls
in
charge
of
it
then
he
came
down
the
steps
from
the
platform
and
began
the
long
march
back
to
the
the
shouting
carousing
revelers
followed
him
joyfully
halfway
back
one
of
them
stumbled
forward
and
caught
at
the
trailing
edge
of
his
robe
there
was
an
immediate
crackle
and
burst
of
static
electricity
and
the
stumbler
fell
back
yelping
and
shaking
his
arms
the
myrmidons
came
and
took
him
away
dionysus
could
be
touched
by
anyone
except
those
authorized
to
do
so
the
seven
girls
and
the
priests
but
forrester
barely
noticed
the
accident
he
was
too
happy
on
top
of
his
world
laughing
and
hugging
the
girls
close
to
him
behind
him
the
priests
at
the
golden
hogshead
now
set
free
to
taste
the
wine
themselves
had
lost
no
time
they
were
dipping
in
busily
with
their
own
goblets
a
good
deal
smaller
than
the
crystal
one
for
dionysus
himself
there
was
not
even
any
need
for
libations
enough
ran
over
the
brimming
edges
of
the
goblets
to
take
care
of
that
detail
and
the
priests
were
soon
well
on
the
way
to
becoming
sozzled
the
musicians
now
joined
by
the
corps
which
had
waited
on
the
uptown
stage
struck
up
a
new
tune
and
drowned
out
even
the
shouting
crowds
as
they
cheered
their
god
after
a
little
while
the
crowds
began
to
sing
along
with
the
magnificent
noise
wrapped
his
hand
around
the
goblet
around
the
goblet
around
the
goblet
dionysus
wrapped
his
hand
around
the
goblet
and
we
all
get
stinking
drunk
it
was
by
no
means
an
official
hymn
but
forrester
did
mind
it
was
sung
with
such
a
great
deal
of
honest
enthusiasm
he
himself
did
not
join
in
the
singing
he
was
otherwise
occupied
with
his
arms
around
two
of
the
girls
drinking
now
and
then
from
the
great
goblet
three
more
were
holding
and
winking
and
laughing
at
the
extra
two
he
made
his
joyous
way
down
the
paths
of
central
park
the
procession
wound
down
through
the
paths
over
bridges
and
under
tunnels
singing
and
playing
and
marching
and
dancing
madly
while
forrester
at
its
head
caroused
as
merrily
as
any
four
of
them
they
reached
a
bridge
crossing
a
little
stream
and
forrester
sprang
at
it
with
a
great
somersaulting
leap
that
carried
the
two
girls
he
was
holding
right
along
with
him
he
set
them
down
at
the
slope
of
the
bridge
laughing
and
giggling
and
the
other
girls
with
the
procession
behind
them
soon
caught
up
forrester
let
go
of
one
of
the
girls
grabbed
the
goblet
with
his
free
hand
and
swung
it
in
a
magnificent
gesture
forward
he
cried
the
procession
surged
over
the
bridge
forrester
at
its
head
he
grabbed
the
girl
again
handing
the
goblet
back
to
his
corps
of
three
carriers
and
bowed
and
grinned
at
his
worshippers
behind
him
surging
forward
and
at
some
others
standing
under
the
bridge
even
in
the
rushing
water
craning
their
necks
upward
to
get
a
really
good
view
of
their
god
as
he
passed
over
there
were
over
a
hundred
of
them
there
forrester
did
see
a
hundred
of
them
he
saw
one
of
them
first
and
then
two
more
and
time
seemed
to
stop
with
a
grinding
halt
forrester
wanted
to
run
and
hide
he
clutched
the
girls
closer
to
him
with
one
instinctive
gesture
and
then
realized
made
the
wrong
move
but
it
was
too
late
he
was
lost
he
told
himself
dolefully
the
sun
had
gone
out
the
wine
had
lost
its
power
and
the
celebration
had
degenerated
to
a
succession
of
ugly
noises
the
first
face
he
saw
belonged
to
gerda
symes
in
that
timeless
instant
forrester
felt
that
he
could
see
every
detail
of
the
soft
small
face
the
dark
hair
the
slim
curved
figure
she
was
smiling
up
at
him
but
her
face
looked
a
little
bewildered
as
if
she
were
smiling
only
because
it
was
the
thing
to
do
forrester
wondered
how
she
an
athenan
had
managed
to
get
entry
to
a
dionysian
revel
but
his
wonder
only
lasted
for
a
second
then
he
saw
the
second
and
third
faces
and
he
knew
the
second
face
belonged
to
an
absolute
stranger
he
looked
like
an
oafish
clod
even
viewed
objectively
and
forrester
was
making
no
efforts
in
that
direction
he
had
one
arm
around
gerda
waist
and
he
was
grinning
up
at
her
and
sideways
at
forrester
with
a
look
that
made
them
in
what
was
certainly
planned
to
be
seduction
forrester
did
like
the
idea
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
hated
it
more
than
he
could
possibly
say
but
all
he
could
do
was
trust
to
gerda
own
doubtless
sterling
good
sense
she
could
possibly
prefer
a
lout
like
her
current
escort
to
good
old
bill
forrester
could
she
on
the
other
hand
she
thought
bill
forrester
was
dead
she
had
to
think
that
when
he
became
dionysus
the
lesser
he
could
just
disappear
he
had
to
die
officially
and
as
far
as
gerda
knew
the
death
was
just
an
official
formality
with
bill
forrester
dead
then
had
she
turned
to
the
oaf
for
comfort
he
did
look
very
comforting
forrester
thought
he
looked
like
a
damned
outrage
on
the
face
of
the
earth
forrester
disliked
him
on
first
sight
and
knew
perfectly
well
that
any
future
sights
would
only
increase
the
dislike
it
was
the
third
face
though
that
explained
everything
the
third
face
was
as
unmistakable
as
gerda
though
in
an
entirely
different
way
it
was
fleshy
and
pasty
and
it
belonged
of
course
to
gerda
lovable
brother
ed
forrester
saw
everything
in
one
flash
of
understanding
ed
symes
obviously
had
enough
pull
to
get
his
sister
invited
to
the
bacchanal
and
from
the
looks
of
gerda
he
had
let
the
matter
rest
there
she
was
holding
a
plastic
mug
of
wine
in
one
hand
a
mug
with
the
picture
of
dionysus
stamped
on
it
which
for
some
reason
increased
forrester
outrage
and
she
was
trying
her
best
to
look
as
if
she
were
reveling
from
the
looks
of
her
ed
had
managed
to
get
her
about
eight
inches
this
side
of
and
from
the
horribly
cheerful
look
on
countenance
he
was
about
to
stop
at
the
mark
either
of
course
from
ed
point
of
view
and
forrester
told
himself
sternly
that
he
had
to
be
fair
about
this
whole
thing
from
ed
point
of
view
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
what
was
happening
he
wanted
to
cheer
gerda
up
undoubtedly
the
news
of
the
forrester
demise
had
been
quite
a
shock
to
her
poor
girl
and
what
better
way
than
to
introduce
her
to
his
own
religion
the
best
of
all
possible
religions
the
autumn
bacchanal
must
have
looked
like
the
perfect
time
and
place
for
that
introduction
and
gerda
escort
a
friend
of
ed
somehow
forrester
had
to
think
of
him
as
ed
friend
it
was
clearly
not
possible
that
he
was
gerda
had
been
brought
along
to
help
cheer
the
girl
up
and
show
her
the
advantages
of
worshipping
dionysus
unfortunately
the
advantages
had
turned
out
to
be
all
that
had
been
expected
of
them
because
now
gerda
had
seen
forrester
alive
and
wait
a
minute
forrester
told
himself
gerda
had
seen
william
forrester
at
all
she
had
seen
just
what
she
expected
to
see
dionysus
god
of
wine
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
shrink
from
her
or
try
to
hide
just
because
he
was
walking
along
with
seven
beautiful
girls
drinking
about
sixteen
times
the
consumption
of
any
normal
fish
and
carousing
like
the
most
unprincipled
of
men
he
did
have
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
he
was
only
doing
his
job
and
gerda
did
not
know
that
he
was
dionysus
the
thought
made
him
feel
a
little
better
but
it
saddened
him
too
just
a
bit
he
set
himself
grimly
and
shouted
forward
once
more
to
his
own
ears
his
voice
lacked
conviction
but
the
crowd
did
seem
to
notice
the
cheered
frantically
forrester
wished
they
would
all
go
away
he
started
forward
his
foot
found
a
large
pebble
that
had
been
there
before
and
he
performed
the
magnificent
feat
of
tripping
on
it
he
flailed
the
air
frantically
and
managed
to
regain
his
balance
then
he
was
back
on
his
feet
clutching
at
the
girls
his
big
left
toe
hurt
but
he
ignored
the
agony
bravely
he
had
to
think
of
something
to
do
and
fast
the
crowd
had
seen
him
stumble
and
that
just
did
happen
to
a
god
it
would
have
happened
to
him
either
except
for
gerda
he
got
his
mind
off
gerda
with
an
effort
and
thought
about
what
to
do
to
cover
his
slip
in
a
moment
he
had
it
he
swore
a
great
oath
empurpling
the
air
then
he
bent
down
and
picked
up
the
stone
he
held
it
aloft
for
a
second
and
then
threw
it
slowly
and
carefully
he
pointed
his
index
finger
at
it
extending
it
and
raising
his
thumb
like
a
little
boy
playing
he
said
mildly
cocking
the
thumb
forward
a
crackling
searing
bolt
of
energy
leaped
out
of
the
tip
of
his
index
finger
in
a
beam
it
sped
toward
the
falling
pebble
speared
it
and
wrapped
it
in
coruscating
splendor
then
the
pebble
exploded
scattering
into
a
fine
display
of
flying
dust
the
crowd
stopped
moving
and
singing
immediately
only
the
musicians
too
intent
on
their
noisemaking
to
see
what
had
gone
on
went
on
playing
but
the
crowd
having
seen
forrester
display
and
heard
his
oath
was
as
silent
as
a
collection
of
statues
when
a
god
became
angry
each
was
obviously
thinking
there
was
absolutely
no
telling
what
was
going
to
happen
foxholes
some
of
them
might
have
told
themselves
would
definitely
be
a
good
idea
but
of
course
there
were
any
foxholes
in
central
park
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
stand
very
still
and
hope
you
were
noticed
and
hope
for
the
best
even
gerda
forrester
saw
had
stopped
her
face
still
her
hand
lifted
in
a
wave
the
plastic
cup
forgotten
got
to
do
forrester
thought
ca
let
this
kind
of
thing
go
he
thought
fast
spun
around
and
pointed
directly
at
ed
symes
standing
in
the
water
below
the
bridge
you
there
he
bellowed
symes
turned
a
delicate
white
against
this
basic
color
his
pimples
stood
out
strongly
making
forrester
thought
a
rather
unusual
and
somewhat
striking
effect
the
man
looked
as
if
he
wished
he
could
sink
out
of
sight
in
the
water
his
mouth
opened
two
or
three
times
forrester
waited
getting
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
the
simple
sight
finally
symes
spoke
me
certainly
you
you
look
like
a
tough
young
specimen
symes
tried
to
grin
the
effect
was
ghastly
i
do
he
said
tentatively
of
course
you
do
your
god
tells
you
so
do
you
doubt
him
doubt
no
absolutely
not
never
would
think
of
it
tough
young
specimen
that
what
i
am
tough
and
young
tough
young
specimen
certainly
you
bet
good
forrester
said
now
let
see
you
in
action
symes
took
a
deep
breath
he
seemed
to
be
savoring
it
as
if
he
thought
it
was
going
to
be
his
very
last
wh
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
want
you
to
pick
up
another
stone
and
throw
it
let
see
how
high
you
can
get
it
symes
was
obviously
afraid
to
move
from
his
spot
in
the
water
instead
of
going
back
to
the
land
he
fished
around
near
his
feet
and
finally
managed
to
come
up
with
a
pebble
almost
as
big
as
his
fist
he
looked
at
it
doubtfully
throw
forrester
said
in
a
voice
like
thunder
symes
galvanized
threw
it
flew
up
in
the
air
forrester
drew
a
careful
bead
on
it
went
again
with
the
pointed
finger
and
blasted
the
rock
into
dust
the
silence
hung
on
forrester
laughed
not
a
bad
throw
for
a
mortal
and
a
good
trick
too
a
fine
display
he
faced
the
crowd
now
there
what
do
you
say
to
the
entertainment
your
god
provides
was
that
well
naturally
it
was
if
dionysus
said
so
a
great
trick
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
a
perfectly
wonderful
display
the
crowd
agreed
immediately
giving
a
long
rousing
cheer
forrester
waved
at
them
and
then
turned
to
a
squad
of
myrmidons
standing
nearby
go
to
that
man
and
his
friends
he
shouted
noticing
that
knees
had
begun
to
shake
the
myrmidons
obeyed
see
that
they
follow
near
me
allow
them
to
remain
close
to
me
at
all
times
i
may
need
a
good
later
gerda
her
brother
and
the
oaf
without
a
name
were
rounded
up
in
a
hurry
and
soon
found
themselves
being
hustled
along
out
of
the
water
up
onto
the
bridge
and
into
dionysus
van
where
they
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
god
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
procession
of
the
three
forrester
noted
gerda
was
the
only
one
who
did
seem
to
think
the
invitation
a
high
honor
the
sight
gave
him
a
kind
of
hope
at
he
thought
can
keep
an
eye
on
her
this
the
procession
wended
its
way
on
bending
slowly
southward
toward
the
little
again
the
musicians
played
energetically
switching
now
from
the
hymn
to
their
unofficial
little
ditty
some
switched
before
others
some
switched
after
and
some
never
bothered
to
switch
at
all
the
battery
caught
between
the
opposing
claims
of
two
perfectly
good
songs
and
a
lot
of
extraneous
matter
filled
in
as
best
they
could
with
a
good
deal
of
forceful
banging
and
pounding
aided
by
the
steam
calliope
and
the
result
of
all
effort
was
a
growing
cacophony
that
should
have
been
terribly
unpleasant
but
somehow
was
the
shouting
of
the
crowd
joking
and
singing
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
nothing
was
clearly
distinguishable
but
the
general
feeling
was
that
a
lot
of
noise
was
being
produced
and
that
was
all
to
the
good
noise
could
have
been
packaged
by
the
board
foot
and
sold
in
quantities
sufficient
to
equip
every
town
meeting
throughout
the
country
in
full
for
seven
years
and
there
would
have
been
enough
left
over
forrester
thought
to
provide
for
the
subways
the
classrooms
the
offices
and
even
a
couple
of
really
traffic
jams
gerda
and
the
others
of
her
party
marched
quietly
ed
forrester
noticed
tried
a
few
cheers
but
he
got
cold
stares
from
his
sister
and
soon
desisted
the
oaf
shambled
along
his
arm
no
longer
around
waist
this
pleased
forrester
no
end
and
he
was
in
quite
a
happy
mood
by
the
time
the
procession
reached
the
he
was
so
happy
that
he
performed
his
atoning
high
jump
once
again
this
time
with
a
double
somersault
and
a
thrown
in
just
to
make
things
interesting
and
landed
gently
feeling
positively
exhilarated
and
very
godlike
on
the
roof
of
the
temple
as
the
procession
straggled
in
the
music
stopped
forrester
cleared
his
throat
and
shouted
in
his
most
penetrating
roar
to
the
silent
assemblage
hear
me
the
crowd
stirred
looked
up
and
paid
him
the
most
rapt
attention
on
with
the
revels
he
roared
let
the
dancing
begin
let
my
wine
flow
like
the
streams
of
the
park
let
joy
be
unrestrained
he
stood
on
the
roof
then
watching
the
crowd
begin
to
disperse
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
forrester
was
amazed
at
how
quickly
the
time
had
passed
the
procession
itself
had
taken
a
good
six
hours
from
start
to
finish
now
that
he
looked
back
on
it
but
it
certainly
had
seemed
so
long
and
he
did
even
feel
tired
in
spite
of
all
the
dancing
and
cavorting
he
had
gone
in
for
he
did
feel
slightly
intoxicated
but
he
was
sure
how
much
of
that
feeling
was
due
purely
and
simply
to
the
liquor
he
had
managed
to
consume
but
otherwise
he
told
himself
he
felt
perfectly
fine
the
musicians
were
breaking
up
into
little
groups
of
three
and
four
and
five
and
going
off
to
play
softly
to
themselves
among
the
trees
the
man
with
the
steam
calliope
sat
exhausted
over
his
keyboard
the
old
man
with
the
water
glasses
was
receiving
the
earnest
congratulations
of
a
lot
of
people
who
looked
like
relatives
and
now
that
the
official
was
over
a
lot
of
amateurs
playing
and
combs
and
had
broken
out
their
contraptions
and
were
gaily
making
a
joyful
noise
unto
their
god
if
forrester
thought
you
wanted
to
call
it
joyful
the
general
tenor
of
the
sound
was
a
kind
of
swooping
batlike
whine
forrester
stared
down
there
were
gerda
and
her
brother
and
the
oaf
they
were
standing
close
by
the
temple
three
myrmidons
keeping
guard
over
them
the
rest
of
the
crowd
had
dissolved
into
little
bunches
spreading
all
over
the
park
forrester
knew
he
would
have
to
leave
too
and
very
soon
there
were
seven
girls
waiting
for
him
down
below
not
that
he
minded
the
idea
seven
beautiful
girls
after
all
were
seven
beautiful
girls
but
he
did
want
to
keep
an
eye
on
gerda
and
he
was
sure
whether
he
would
be
able
to
do
it
when
he
got
busy
somewhere
in
the
bushes
someone
began
to
play
a
kazoo
adding
the
final
touch
of
melancholy
and
heartbreak
to
the
music
the
formal
and
official
part
of
the
bacchanal
was
now
over
the
fun
forrester
thought
dismally
was
about
to
begin
chapter
nine
now
forrester
said
gaily
let
see
if
your
god
has
all
the
names
right
shall
we
the
seven
girls
seated
around
him
in
a
on
the
grass
giggled
one
of
them
simpered
hmm
forrester
said
he
pointed
a
finger
dorothy
he
said
the
finger
moved
judy
uh
bette
millicent
jayne
he
winked
at
the
last
two
they
had
been
his
closest
companions
on
the
march
down
beverly
he
said
and
kathy
right
the
girls
laughed
nodding
their
heads
you
can
call
me
millie
millicent
said
all
right
millie
for
some
reason
this
drew
another
big
laugh
forrester
did
know
why
but
then
he
did
much
care
either
that
fine
he
said
just
fine
he
gave
all
the
girls
a
big
wide
grin
it
looked
perfectly
convincing
to
them
he
was
sure
but
there
was
one
person
it
did
convince
forrester
he
knew
just
how
far
from
a
grin
he
felt
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
told
himself
he
was
in
something
of
a
quandary
he
was
not
exactly
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
making
love
to
beautiful
young
women
after
the
last
few
months
he
was
about
as
experienced
as
he
could
stand
being
but
his
education
had
it
now
appeared
missed
one
vital
little
factor
he
was
used
to
making
love
to
a
beautiful
girl
all
alone
just
the
two
of
them
locked
quietly
away
from
prying
eyes
true
it
had
turned
out
that
a
lot
of
his
experiences
had
been
judged
by
venus
and
any
other
god
who
felt
like
looking
in
but
forrester
had
known
that
at
the
time
and
in
any
case
the
spectators
had
been
invisible
and
thus
ignorable
now
however
he
was
on
the
greensward
of
central
park
within
full
view
of
a
couple
of
thousand
drunken
revelers
all
of
whom
if
not
otherwise
occupied
asked
for
nothing
better
than
a
good
view
of
their
god
in
action
and
whichever
girl
he
chose
would
leave
six
others
eagerly
awaiting
their
turns
watching
his
every
move
with
appreciative
eyes
and
on
top
of
that
there
was
gerda
close
by
he
was
trying
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
but
was
she
keeping
an
eye
on
him
too
it
did
seem
to
matter
much
that
she
could
recognize
him
as
william
forrester
she
could
still
see
him
in
action
with
the
seven
luscious
maidens
the
idea
was
appalling
all
afternoon
he
had
put
off
the
inevitable
by
every
method
he
could
think
of
he
had
danced
with
each
of
the
girls
in
turn
for
entirely
improbable
lengths
of
time
he
had
performed
leaps
immelmann
turns
and
other
feats
showing
off
his
godlike
prowess
to
anyone
interested
he
had
made
a
display
of
himself
until
he
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
he
had
consumed
staggering
amounts
of
ferment
and
distillate
and
he
had
forced
the
stuff
on
the
girls
themselves
in
the
hope
that
what
with
the
liquor
and
the
exertion
they
would
lie
down
on
the
grass
and
quietly
pass
out
unfortunately
none
of
these
plans
had
worked
dancing
and
acrobatics
had
to
come
to
an
end
sometime
and
as
for
the
girls
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
lie
down
not
pass
out
at
least
not
from
liquor
the
chosen
maidens
had
been
imbued
temporarily
with
extraordinary
staying
powers
by
the
priests
of
the
various
temples
working
with
the
delegated
powers
of
the
various
gods
after
all
an
ordinary
girl
could
be
expected
to
keep
up
with
dionysus
during
a
revel
could
she
a
god
reveling
was
more
than
any
ordinary
mortal
could
take
for
long
as
witness
the
ancient
legend
concerned
the
false
norse
god
thor
but
these
girls
were
still
raring
to
go
and
the
sun
had
set
and
he
was
running
out
of
opportunities
for
delay
he
tried
to
think
of
some
more
excuses
and
he
could
think
of
one
vaguely
he
wished
that
the
real
dionysus
would
show
up
he
would
gladly
give
the
god
not
only
the
credit
he
told
himself
wearily
but
the
entire
game
he
glanced
out
into
the
growing
dimness
gerda
was
out
there
still
with
her
brother
and
the
oaf
whose
name
forrester
had
discovered
was
alvin
sherdlap
it
was
not
a
probable
name
but
alvin
did
not
look
like
a
probable
human
being
now
and
again
during
the
long
afternoon
forrester
had
got
ed
symes
to
toss
up
more
rocks
as
targets
just
to
keep
his
hand
in
and
to
help
him
in
keeping
an
eye
on
gerda
and
her
oaf
alvin
it
was
a
boring
business
exploding
rocks
in
but
after
a
while
symes
apparently
got
to
like
it
and
thought
of
it
as
a
singular
honor
after
all
he
had
been
picked
for
a
unique
position
for
the
great
god
dionysus
who
else
could
make
that
statement
he
would
probably
grow
in
the
estimation
of
his
friends
forrester
thought
and
that
was
a
picture
that
would
stand
much
thinking
about
as
a
stupefying
boor
symes
was
bad
enough
adding
insufferable
snobbishness
to
his
present
personality
was
piling
pelion
on
ossa
and
only
a
god
forrester
reminded
himself
wryly
could
possibly
do
that
now
forrester
discovered
symes
and
alvin
sherdlap
and
gerda
were
all
sitting
around
a
large
keg
of
beer
which
symes
had
somehow
managed
to
appropriate
from
some
other
part
of
the
grounds
he
and
alvin
were
guzzling
happily
and
gerda
was
just
sitting
there
whiling
away
the
time
apparently
by
thinking
forrester
wondered
if
she
was
thinking
of
him
and
the
notion
made
him
feel
sad
and
poetic
gerda
could
see
him
any
longer
he
knew
the
darkness
of
night
had
come
down
and
there
was
no
moon
the
only
illumination
was
the
glow
rising
from
the
rest
of
the
city
since
the
lights
of
the
park
would
stay
out
throughout
the
night
to
an
ordinary
mortal
the
remaining
light
was
not
enough
to
see
anything
more
than
a
few
feet
away
but
to
forrester
godlike
abnormally
perceptive
vision
the
park
seemed
no
darker
than
it
had
at
dusk
an
hour
or
so
before
though
the
symes
trio
could
not
possibly
see
him
he
could
still
watch
over
them
with
no
effort
at
all
he
intended
to
continue
doing
so
but
now
with
darkness
putting
a
cloak
over
his
activities
and
his
mind
completely
empty
of
excuses
was
the
time
to
begin
the
task
at
hand
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
very
softly
well
he
said
well
there
had
to
be
something
to
follow
that
but
for
a
minute
he
think
of
what
millicent
giggled
unexpectedly
oh
lord
dionysus
i
feel
so
er
forrester
said
finally
he
found
words
oh
that
all
right
he
said
wondering
exactly
what
he
meant
perfectly
all
right
millicent
call
me
millie
of
course
millie
you
can
call
me
bets
if
you
want
to
bette
chimed
in
bette
was
a
blonde
with
short
curly
hair
and
a
startling
figure
it
kind
of
a
pet
name
you
know
sure
forrester
said
uh
would
you
mind
keeping
your
voices
down
a
little
why
millicent
asked
forrester
passed
a
hand
over
his
forehead
well
he
said
at
last
thinking
about
gerda
only
a
few
feet
away
i
thought
it
might
be
nicer
if
we
were
quiet
sort
of
private
and
romantic
oh
bette
said
kathy
spoke
up
you
mean
we
have
to
whisper
as
if
we
were
doing
something
secret
forrester
tightened
his
lips
he
felt
the
beginnings
of
a
strong
distaste
for
kathy
why
could
she
leave
well
enough
alone
but
he
only
said
well
yes
i
thought
it
might
be
fun
let
try
it
girls
of
course
lord
dionysus
kathy
said
demurely
he
disliked
her
he
decided
intensely
there
was
a
little
silence
well
forrester
said
you
all
such
beautiful
girls
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
ah
proceed
from
here
millicent
tittered
so
did
one
of
the
others
judy
forrester
thought
i
would
want
any
of
you
to
feel
disappointed
or
think
you
were
any
lower
in
my
estimation
than
than
any
other
one
of
you
the
sentence
seemed
to
have
got
lost
somewhere
forrester
thought
but
he
had
straightened
it
out
that
would
be
fair
he
went
on
and
we
gods
are
always
fair
the
sentence
did
ring
quite
true
in
forrester
mind
and
he
thought
he
heard
one
of
the
girls
snicker
but
he
ignored
it
and
went
bravely
on
so
he
said
we
going
to
have
a
little
game
millicent
said
game
sure
forrester
said
trying
his
best
to
sound
enthusiastic
we
all
like
games
do
we
i
mean
what
an
orgy
i
mean
what
a
revel
but
a
great
big
game
is
that
right
well
bette
said
doubtfully
i
guess
so
sure
lord
dionysus
if
you
say
so
well
sure
it
is
forrester
said
fun
and
games
so
we
play
a
little
game
kathy
looked
up
at
him
brightly
what
kind
of
game
lord
dionysus
she
asked
in
an
innocent
tone
she
was
an
extravagantly
pretty
brunette
with
bright
brown
eyes
and
she
had
been
one
of
the
two
he
had
held
in
his
arms
during
the
procession
back
from
the
uptown
end
of
the
park
thinking
it
over
now
forrester
was
entirely
sure
whether
he
had
chosen
her
or
she
had
chosen
him
but
it
did
really
seem
to
matter
after
all
well
now
he
said
it
going
to
be
a
game
of
pure
chance
chance
and
nothing
more
like
luck
bette
contributed
that
right
uh
bets
forrester
said
like
luck
and
i
promise
not
to
use
my
powers
to
affect
the
outcome
fair
enough
is
it
certainly
kathy
said
demurely
there
was
really
no
reason
for
him
to
be
irritated
by
the
girl
so
long
as
she
was
agreeing
with
him
so
nicely
nevertheless
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
speaking
her
mind
oh
millicent
said
sure
bette
nodded
i
mean
yes
lord
dionysus
forrester
waved
a
hand
no
need
for
formality
he
said
and
felt
like
an
ass
but
none
of
the
girls
seemed
to
notice
agreement
with
his
idea
became
general
well
let
see
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
surrounding
scenery
in
quiet
thought
several
myrmidons
were
scattered
about
twenty
feet
away
and
they
were
standing
with
their
backs
to
the
group
as
a
matter
of
formality
if
they
had
turned
around
they
could
have
seen
a
thing
in
the
darkness
but
they
had
to
remain
at
their
stations
to
make
sure
no
unauthorized
persons
musicians
or
just
plain
lost
souls
intruded
upon
great
dionysus
while
he
was
occupied
the
myrmidons
were
the
only
living
souls
within
that
radius
except
for
forrester
himself
and
his
bevy
and
the
symes
trio
his
gaze
settled
on
them
ed
symes
he
noticed
with
quiet
satisfaction
was
now
out
cold
forrester
thought
that
the
little
spell
he
had
cast
on
the
beer
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
that
and
he
felt
rather
pleased
with
his
efforts
at
least
in
that
direction
symes
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
snoring
loudly
enough
to
drown
out
all
but
a
few
notes
from
the
steam
calliope
which
was
singing
itself
loudly
to
sleep
somewhere
in
the
distance
near
the
prone
figure
gerda
was
trying
to
fend
off
the
advances
of
good
old
alvin
sherdlap
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
sheer
passage
of
time
plus
the
amount
of
liquor
she
had
consumed
were
weakening
her
resistance
forrester
pointed
a
finger
at
the
man
the
one
thing
he
really
wanted
to
do
was
to
give
alvin
the
rock
treatment
one
little
would
do
it
and
alvin
sherdlap
would
encumber
the
earth
no
more
and
it
was
as
if
alvin
would
be
missed
forrester
told
himself
it
was
clear
from
one
look
at
the
lout
that
no
one
anywhere
for
any
reason
would
miss
alvin
if
he
were
exploded
into
dust
the
temptation
was
very
nearly
irresistible
but
somehow
forrester
managed
to
resist
it
he
had
been
told
that
he
had
to
be
extremely
careful
in
the
use
of
his
powers
and
he
had
a
pretty
good
idea
that
he
would
be
able
to
justify
blasting
alvin
viewed
objectively
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
what
the
oaf
was
doing
he
was
merely
following
his
religion
as
he
understood
it
and
the
religion
was
a
very
simple
one
when
at
an
orgy
have
an
orgy
gerda
did
have
to
give
in
if
she
did
want
to
forrester
thought
he
tried
very
hard
to
make
himself
believe
that
but
his
finger
was
still
pointed
at
the
man
he
did
stop
his
powers
entirely
he
merely
throttled
them
down
so
that
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
neural
energy
at
his
command
came
into
play
the
energy
that
came
from
the
tip
of
his
finger
made
no
noise
and
cast
no
light
it
was
not
a
killing
blow
invisibly
it
leaped
across
the
intervening
space
and
hit
alvin
sherdlap
squarely
on
the
nose
the
results
were
eminently
satisfactory
alvin
uttered
a
sharp
cry
let
go
of
gerda
and
fell
over
backward
his
legs
stood
up
straight
in
the
air
for
a
second
and
then
came
down
to
hit
the
ground
he
was
silent
gerda
stared
down
at
him
too
tired
and
confused
to
make
any
coherent
picture
out
of
what
was
going
on
forrester
sighed
happily
to
himself
he
thought
to
take
care
of
alvin
for
a
lord
dionysus
kathy
asked
in
that
same
innocent
tone
what
are
you
pointing
at
out
there
the
girl
was
decidedly
irritating
forrester
thought
pointing
he
said
ah
yes
he
thought
fast
my
i
fear
that
his
religious
fervor
has
led
to
his
being
overcome
the
girls
all
turned
round
to
look
but
of
course
forrester
thought
they
could
see
nothing
at
all
in
the
darkness
my
goodness
bette
said
but
if
he
unconscious
kathy
put
in
why
were
you
pointing
at
him
forrester
told
himself
that
the
next
time
the
sabbatical
bacchanal
was
held
he
would
see
to
it
that
an
intelligence
test
was
given
to
every
candidate
for
dionysian
escort
and
anyone
who
scored
as
high
on
it
as
kathy
would
be
automatically
disqualified
he
had
to
think
of
some
excuse
for
looking
at
the
man
and
then
he
had
it
the
game
he
had
planned
it
was
really
quite
a
nice
little
idea
i
hate
to
see
the
poor
mortal
miss
out
on
the
rest
of
the
evening
forrester
said
even
if
he
is
asleep
now
and
i
think
we
may
have
a
use
for
him
he
gestured
gently
with
one
hand
gerda
and
alvin
sherdlap
did
even
notice
what
was
happening
they
were
much
too
busy
arguing
alvin
claiming
that
somebody
had
slapped
him
on
the
nose
and
pretty
hard
too
let
me
tell
you
and
gerda
swearing
she
had
done
it
the
fact
that
ed
symes
snores
were
fading
quietly
into
the
distance
dawned
on
neither
of
them
but
ed
was
in
flight
he
rose
five
feet
above
the
ground
still
unconscious
and
snoring
and
sped
unerringly
across
the
air
like
a
large
fat
arrow
shot
from
a
bow
in
the
direction
of
forrester
and
the
circle
of
girls
he
appeared
overhead
suddenly
and
forrester
controlled
him
so
that
he
drifted
downward
as
delicately
as
an
overweight
snowflake
eddying
in
the
slight
breeze
while
the
girls
gaped
at
him
forrester
allowed
the
body
to
drop
the
last
six
inches
out
of
control
so
that
ed
symes
landed
with
a
heavy
thump
in
the
center
of
the
circle
but
no
harm
was
done
ed
was
very
far
gone
indeed
he
merely
snored
on
there
forrester
said
millicent
blinked
where
she
said
him
certainly
forrester
said
in
a
pleased
tone
he
a
good
deal
too
noisy
though
do
you
think
he
snores
a
lot
judy
offered
in
a
tentative
voice
if
that
what
you
mean
lord
dionysus
exactly
and
i
do
see
any
reason
to
put
up
with
it
instead
well
just
put
him
in
stasis
for
a
little
while
and
that
keep
him
quiet
again
he
waved
one
hand
almost
carelessly
ed
symes
snores
vanished
immediately
leaving
the
world
a
cleaner
purer
quieter
place
to
live
in
and
his
body
became
as
rigid
as
if
he
were
a
statue
there
forrester
said
again
with
satisfaction
now
what
kathy
asked
now
we
straighten
him
out
one
more
pass
and
ed
symes
arms
were
at
his
sides
his
legs
stretched
straight
out
only
his
stomach
projected
above
the
rigid
lines
of
his
body
forrester
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
pleasing
sight
dorothy
gasped
is
he
is
he
dead
forrester
looked
at
her
reprovingly
dead
now
what
would
i
do
that
for
after
he
been
so
helpful
and
all
i
do
know
she
muttered
well
forrester
said
he
not
dead
he
just
in
stasis
in
a
state
of
totally
suspended
animation
as
soon
as
i
take
the
spell
off
be
all
right
but
i
do
think
i
take
it
off
just
yet
i
got
plans
for
my
little
he
reached
over
and
touched
the
stiff
body
it
seemed
to
rise
a
fraction
of
an
inch
floating
on
the
tips
of
the
grass
the
wind
stirred
it
a
little
but
it
did
float
away
i
took
some
of
his
weight
off
forrester
explained
so
he
be
a
little
easier
to
handle
now
ed
symes
was
behaving
as
if
he
were
a
statue
carved
out
of
cork
with
a
quick
flip
forrester
turned
the
statue
over
the
effect
was
exactly
what
he
wanted
ed
did
not
touch
the
grass
at
any
point
except
one
the
point
where
his
protuberant
stomach
most
protruded
fore
and
aft
the
rest
of
him
was
balanced
stiffly
in
the
air
forrester
gazed
at
the
sight
feeling
fulfilled
now
he
said
with
a
note
of
decision
in
his
voice
we
are
going
to
play
the
girls
giggled
and
laughed
you
mean
with
him
bette
said
forrester
sighed
that
right
he
said
patiently
with
him
he
got
into
position
and
looked
up
at
the
girls
this
one
just
for
practice
so
we
can
all
see
how
it
works
he
gave
symes
extended
foot
a
little
push
he
thought
round
and
round
the
gentleman
went
spinning
quietly
on
his
stomach
revolving
in
a
merry
fashion
while
the
girls
and
forrester
watched
silently
at
last
he
slowed
and
stopped
his
nose
pointing
at
bette
and
his
toes
at
dorothy
oh
my
dorothy
said
he
pointing
at
me
he
is
not
bette
said
decisively
his
head
points
my
way
but
he
temper
temper
forrester
said
no
arguments
that
one
did
count
anyhow
it
was
just
to
see
how
he
worked
and
i
do
think
he
works
very
nicely
do
you
oh
yes
lord
dionysus
kathy
said
there
was
the
same
undertone
in
her
voice
as
if
she
were
silently
laughing
at
everything
she
was
he
told
himself
an
extremely
unlikable
young
woman
the
other
girls
agreed
in
a
chorus
they
were
still
studying
the
stiff
body
of
ed
symes
his
stomach
had
made
a
little
depression
in
the
grass
as
he
whirled
and
he
was
now
nicely
bedded
down
for
a
real
spin
forrester
rubbed
his
hands
together
fine
he
said
now
all
of
you
are
going
to
be
judges
me
too
bette
asked
forrester
nodded
the
head
will
be
the
determining
factor
if
our
little
mr
bottle
head
points
to
any
one
of
you
that
is
the
one
choose
first
see
bette
said
i
told
you
it
was
his
head
well
i
could
tell
before
anybody
said
so
dorothy
said
and
anyhow
i
now
now
girls
forrester
said
feeling
momentarily
like
a
girl
scout
troop
leader
let
listen
to
the
rules
shall
we
and
then
we
can
get
down
to
playing
the
game
he
took
a
deep
breath
is
this
fun
the
girls
giggled
good
forrester
said
if
mr
bottle
head
ends
up
between
two
of
you
then
the
other
five
girls
will
have
to
decide
which
girl
the
nearer
to
the
two
girls
involved
will
remain
absolutely
quiet
during
the
judging
and
if
the
other
five
ca
come
to
a
unanimous
agreement
we
spin
mr
bottle
again
understand
you
mean
if
the
head
points
at
me
i
get
picked
bette
said
and
if
the
head
goes
in
between
me
and
somebody
else
all
the
other
girls
have
to
decide
who
gets
picked
it
was
a
masterly
summation
right
forrester
said
i
going
to
give
mr
bottle
a
spin
this
one
counts
we
have
the
second
spin
and
the
rest
of
them
later
gee
millicent
whispered
is
this
forrester
ignored
the
comment
and
remember
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
god
that
i
will
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
workings
of
chance
is
that
clearly
understood
the
girls
murmured
agreement
now
forrester
said
all
you
girls
get
into
a
nice
circle
i
stand
outside
the
girls
took
a
minute
or
two
arranging
themselves
in
a
circle
arguing
about
who
was
going
to
sit
next
to
whom
and
whose
very
proximity
was
bound
to
bring
bad
luck
the
argument
gave
forrester
a
chance
to
check
on
gerda
again
she
was
whispering
softly
to
alvin
but
they
touching
each
other
forrester
turned
up
his
hearing
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
was
going
on
they
had
progressed
in
the
usual
manner
from
argument
to
gerda
was
telling
alvin
all
about
her
past
but
do
misunderstand
me
alvin
it
just
that
i
was
in
love
with
a
very
fine
young
man
an
athenan
he
was
a
wonderful
man
really
wonderful
but
he
he
was
killed
in
a
subway
accident
some
months
ago
gosh
alvin
said
i
sorry
i
i
have
to
tell
you
this
alvin
so
you
understand
i
still
love
him
he
was
wonderful
and
until
i
get
over
it
i
simply
ca
feeling
both
ashamed
of
himself
and
pleased
as
well
as
sorry
for
the
poor
girl
forrester
quit
listening
the
gods
had
arranged
his
simulated
death
which
of
course
had
been
a
necessity
his
disappearance
had
to
be
explained
somehow
but
he
did
like
the
idea
of
gerda
having
to
suffer
so
much
god
forrester
thought
still
loves
me
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
heard
her
say
so
flatly
right
out
in
the
open
he
wanted
to
bound
and
leap
and
cavort
but
he
could
he
had
to
go
back
to
his
seven
beautiful
girls
he
had
never
felt
less
like
it
in
his
life
but
at
least
he
consoled
himself
gerda
was
keeping
alvin
at
length
she
was
being
faithful
to
his
memory
faithful
because
she
loved
him
grimly
he
turned
back
to
the
girls
well
are
we
all
ready
now
kathy
looked
up
at
him
brightly
lord
dionysus
it
so
dark
i
even
see
for
sure
what
going
on
how
can
we
do
any
judging
if
we
ca
see
forrester
cursed
kathy
for
pointing
out
the
flaw
in
his
arrangements
then
making
a
nice
impartial
job
of
it
he
cursed
himself
for
forgetting
that
what
was
perfectly
visible
to
him
was
dark
night
to
mortals
we
can
clear
that
up
he
said
quickly
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
just
getting
around
to
it
we
will
now
proceed
to
shed
a
little
light
on
the
subject
said
subject
being
our
old
friend
mr
bottle
the
trick
had
been
taught
to
him
by
venus
but
he
never
had
a
chance
to
practice
it
this
was
his
first
real
experience
with
it
and
he
could
only
hope
that
it
went
off
as
it
was
supposed
to
he
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
circle
near
ed
symes
stiff
body
and
held
his
right
hand
above
his
head
thumb
and
forefinger
spread
an
inch
apart
and
the
other
three
fingers
folded
into
his
palm
then
he
concentrated
a
long
second
ticked
by
while
forrester
tried
to
apply
even
more
neural
pressure
then
a
small
ball
of
light
appeared
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
a
yellow
cold
sphere
of
fire
that
shed
its
radiance
over
the
whole
group
carefully
he
withdrew
his
hand
not
daring
to
breathe
the
ball
of
yellow
fire
remained
in
position
hanging
in
the
muffled
gasp
from
the
circle
of
girls
was
forrester
told
himself
a
definite
tribute
now
do
worry
about
it
girls
he
said
that
light
only
visible
to
the
eight
of
us
nobody
else
can
see
it
there
was
another
little
series
of
gasps
forrester
grinned
can
everybody
see
each
other
a
murmur
of
agreement
can
everybody
see
mr
bottle
here
another
murmur
in
that
case
let
go
he
stepped
outside
the
circle
of
girls
reached
in
again
for
ed
symes
foot
and
set
the
gentleman
spinning
once
more
symes
spun
with
a
blinding
speed
making
a
low
whistling
noise
forrester
watched
the
body
spin
dizzily
just
as
anxious
as
the
girls
were
to
find
out
who
the
first
winner
was
going
to
be
he
thought
of
millicent
who
chewed
gum
and
made
it
pop
he
thought
of
bette
the
inveterate
explainer
and
expert
he
tried
to
think
of
dorothy
and
jayne
and
beverly
and
judy
but
the
thought
of
kathy
irritating
and
uncomfortable
and
too
damned
bright
for
her
own
good
got
annoyingly
in
the
way
he
was
rather
glad
he
had
promised
not
to
use
his
powers
on
the
spinning
figure
he
was
not
at
all
sure
which
one
of
the
girls
he
would
have
picked
for
number
one
and
he
had
after
all
given
his
word
as
a
god
true
he
was
quite
a
god
only
a
but
he
did
feel
that
dionysus
might
object
to
his
name
being
used
in
vain
a
promise
he
told
himself
sternly
and
with
some
relief
was
a
promise
after
some
time
ed
bottle
symes
began
to
slow
perceptibly
the
whistling
died
as
symes
began
rotating
about
his
abdominal
axis
at
a
more
and
more
leisurely
rate
seconds
passed
symes
faced
bette
millicent
kathy
judy
bette
again
forrester
watched
fascinated
finally
symes
came
to
a
halt
all
the
elaborate
instructions
in
case
the
bottle
ended
up
pointing
between
two
girls
had
been
forrester
saw
totally
unnecessary
symes
head
was
pointing
at
one
girl
and
one
girl
alone
she
gave
a
little
squeal
of
delight
the
others
began
chorusing
their
congratulations
at
once
looking
no
more
convincing
than
the
in
any
beauty
contest
their
smiles
appeared
to
have
been
glued
on
loosely
and
their
voices
lacked
a
certain
something
possibly
it
was
sincerity
all
right
that
it
for
now
forrester
turned
to
the
winner
my
congratulations
he
said
wondering
just
what
he
was
supposed
to
say
not
finding
any
appropriate
words
he
turned
back
to
the
group
of
six
losers
the
rest
of
you
girls
can
do
me
a
big
favor
go
get
a
couple
of
the
myrmidons
to
protect
you
hunt
around
for
the
nearest
wine
barrel
and
confiscate
it
for
me
it
been
a
thirsty
day
gee
jayne
said
sure
we
will
lord
dionysus
now
take
your
time
forrester
said
and
the
losers
all
giggled
at
once
like
a
trained
chorus
forrester
grimaced
do
come
back
till
you
find
a
barrel
then
we
play
the
game
again
in
a
disappointed
fashion
the
six
of
them
trooped
off
into
the
darkness
and
vanished
to
mortal
eyes
forrester
watched
them
go
and
then
turned
to
the
winner
feeling
just
a
little
uncertain
well
kathy
he
started
i
she
flung
herself
on
him
with
the
avid
girlishness
of
a
bengal
tiger
i
have
dreamed
of
this
night
since
i
was
but
a
child
at
last
i
am
in
your
arms
i
love
you
take
me
i
am
yours
all
yours
that
nice
forrester
said
taken
far
aback
by
the
girl
sudden
onslaught
his
immediate
impulse
was
to
unwind
kathy
and
set
her
back
on
her
own
feet
some
little
distance
away
after
which
he
could
start
again
on
a
more
leisurely
basis
after
all
he
told
himself
people
ought
to
spend
more
time
getting
to
know
each
other
but
he
remembered
just
in
time
that
he
was
dionysus
he
conquered
his
first
impulse
and
put
his
arms
around
her
as
he
did
so
he
discovered
that
his
face
was
being
covered
with
kisses
kathy
was
murmuring
little
indistinct
terms
of
endearment
into
his
ear
every
time
she
reached
it
en
route
from
one
side
of
his
face
to
the
other
forrester
swallowed
hard
tightened
his
grip
and
planted
his
lips
firmly
on
kathy
a
blaze
of
startling
heat
shot
through
him
in
a
small
corner
at
the
back
of
his
mind
a
scroll
unrolled
on
it
was
written
what
vulcan
had
told
him
about
his
mental
attitude
changing
after
investiture
when
he
had
been
plain
william
forrester
an
attack
like
the
one
kathy
was
making
on
him
had
pretty
much
chilled
him
for
a
while
but
now
he
found
himself
definitely
rising
to
the
occasion
there
was
a
passion
to
her
kiss
that
he
had
never
felt
before
a
rising
tide
of
flame
that
threatened
to
char
him
the
movement
of
her
mouth
on
his
sent
new
fires
burning
throughout
his
body
and
as
her
hands
moved
on
him
he
was
awakened
to
a
new
world
a
world
of
consuming
desires
he
wished
his
own
clothing
away
and
fumbled
for
a
second
at
the
two
fastenings
that
held
kathy
in
place
then
it
was
gone
and
there
was
nothing
between
them
they
met
flesh
to
flesh
in
a
fiery
embrace
that
grew
as
he
forced
her
down
and
she
responded
eagerly
wildly
to
his
every
motion
his
lips
traveled
over
her
her
entire
body
was
drowning
him
once
and
for
all
in
an
unbelievable
red
haze
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
before
experienced
a
great
wave
of
passion
that
went
on
and
on
rising
to
a
peak
he
had
never
dreamed
of
until
his
body
shivered
with
the
sensations
and
he
pressed
on
rising
still
higher
in
an
ecstasy
beyond
measure
his
last
spasm
of
tension
turned
out
the
she
lay
in
his
arms
on
the
grass
holding
him
almost
as
tightly
as
he
held
her
he
felt
exhausted
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
a
god
was
a
god
after
all
and
kathy
was
only
the
hors
of
a
dinner
you
wonderful
kathy
said
in
a
soft
whisper
at
his
ear
absolutely
wonderful
more
wonderful
than
i
could
ever
dream
i
she
was
interrupted
by
a
strange
harsh
voice
that
bellowed
from
somewhere
nearby
all
right
bitch
it
said
get
the
hell
up
from
there
and
you
too
buster
forrester
jerked
his
head
up
in
astonishment
and
froze
kathy
looked
up
fright
written
all
over
her
face
the
man
standing
over
them
in
the
darkness
looked
like
a
one
who
had
taken
a
number
of
beatings
but
always
given
better
than
he
had
received
his
arms
were
akimbo
his
feet
planted
as
firmly
as
if
he
were
a
particularly
stubborn
brand
of
tree
he
glared
down
at
them
his
face
expressive
of
anger
hatred
and
forrester
thought
dully
a
complete
lack
of
respect
for
his
god
the
man
barked
you
heard
what
i
said
on
your
feet
buster
if
i
have
to
kick
your
teeth
in
i
want
to
do
it
when
you
standing
up
forrester
jaw
dropped
then
as
the
initial
shock
left
him
anger
boiled
in
to
take
its
place
he
toyed
with
the
idea
of
blasting
this
mortal
who
showed
such
disrespect
to
a
god
he
sprang
to
his
feet
ready
to
move
and
then
stopped
maybe
the
man
was
crazy
maybe
he
was
just
some
poor
soul
who
responsible
for
his
own
actions
it
would
be
merciful
forrester
thought
to
find
out
first
and
blast
the
intruder
afterward
he
looked
around
twenty
yards
away
the
encircling
myrmidons
still
stood
their
backs
to
the
scene
as
if
nothing
at
all
were
going
on
forrester
blinked
how
you
get
in
here
anyway
the
man
barked
a
laugh
none
of
your
business
he
turned
to
kathy
who
had
devoted
the
previous
few
seconds
to
getting
her
on
again
hurriedly
forrester
wished
back
his
own
costume
kathy
got
up
staring
straight
back
at
the
intruder
fear
was
gone
from
her
face
and
a
kind
of
calmness
that
forrester
had
never
seen
before
possessed
her
now
so
the
intruder
bellowed
the
minute
my
back
is
turned
off
you
go
by
the
stars
and
galaxy
i
i
do
know
what
to
call
you
you
worse
than
your
predecessor
ca
turn
anything
down
you
now
wait
forrester
bellowed
in
his
most
godlike
voice
just
hold
still
there
do
you
know
who
you
talking
to
how
dare
you
and
kathy
interrupted
him
forrester
stood
mute
as
she
stripped
the
stranger
with
a
voice
like
scalding
acid
listen
you
she
said
pointing
a
finger
at
the
man
who
do
you
think
you
are
my
husband
by
the
stars
the
stranger
began
do
bother
trying
to
scare
me
with
your
big
mouth
kathy
went
on
imperturbably
you
do
mean
a
thing
to
me
and
you
ca
order
me
around
what
more
you
know
it
you
not
my
husband
you
big
thug
and
you
never
going
to
be
i
sleep
with
whomever
i
please
and
whenever
i
please
and
wherever
i
please
and
that
the
way
things
are
going
to
be
after
all
it
my
job
is
it
got
any
questions
her
forrester
began
to
wonder
just
what
he
had
managed
to
walk
into
now
but
that
was
a
detail
the
important
thing
was
that
his
godhood
had
been
grossly
unbelievably
insulted
and
at
a
damned
inconvenient
time
too
he
stepped
between
kathy
and
the
intruder
his
eyes
flashing
fire
do
you
know
who
i
am
do
you
know
that
of
course
he
knows
kathy
put
in
abruptly
and
if
you
do
want
to
get
hurt
i
advise
you
to
stay
out
of
this
little
quarrel
forrester
turned
and
stared
at
her
what
the
everlasting
bloody
hell
was
going
but
there
was
any
time
to
think
the
intruder
put
his
face
up
near
forrester
and
glared
at
him
sure
i
know
who
you
are
buster
he
said
you
a
wise
guy
you
a
and
i
know
what
i
ought
to
do
with
you
too
take
you
apart
limb
by
limb
that
did
it
forrester
seeing
several
shades
of
red
decided
that
no
god
could
possibly
object
if
this
ugly
blasphemer
were
blasted
off
the
face
of
the
earth
he
raised
a
hand
and
kathy
grabbed
it
she
said
in
a
frightened
tone
the
intruder
grinned
wolfishly
at
him
pay
no
attention
to
little
miss
sacktime
over
there
forrester
you
go
right
ahead
and
try
it
all
i
need
is
an
excuse
to
vaporize
you
just
one
tiny
little
excuse
and
do
the
job
so
damn
quick
your
head
wo
even
have
time
to
start
swimming
he
set
himself
go
on
let
see
your
stuff
forrester
forrester
arm
came
down
without
his
being
aware
of
it
there
was
only
room
in
his
mind
for
one
thought
the
intruder
had
called
him
forrester
where
had
he
gotten
the
name
and
for
that
matter
how
had
he
seen
the
two
of
them
in
the
darkness
while
the
questions
were
still
spinning
in
forrester
mind
kathy
threw
herself
forward
between
him
and
the
stranger
ares
she
screamed
you
stupid
jealous
idiot
get
some
sense
into
that
brain
of
yours
are
you
completely
crazy
now
you
listen
to
me
the
stranger
began
listen
nothing
if
you
want
to
pick
a
fight
do
it
with
me
i
can
fight
back
but
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
forrester
we
never
find
another
the
stranger
reached
out
casually
and
clamped
one
huge
paw
over
her
mouth
shut
up
he
said
almost
quietly
he
glanced
at
forrester
and
went
on
in
the
same
tone
do
give
away
everything
you
got
chum
a
second
passed
and
then
he
took
the
hand
away
kathy
said
nothing
at
all
for
a
moment
and
then
she
nodded
all
right
she
said
you
right
we
should
be
losing
our
tempers
just
now
but
i
did
start
did
you
the
stranger
said
kathy
shrugged
well
never
mind
it
now
she
turned
to
forrester
you
know
who
we
are
now
do
you
forrester
nodded
very
slowly
how
else
could
the
man
have
come
through
the
cordon
of
myrmidons
and
seen
them
in
the
darkness
how
else
would
he
have
dared
to
face
up
to
dionysus
confident
that
he
could
beat
him
and
how
else
could
all
this
argument
have
gone
on
without
anyone
hearing
it
for
that
matter
why
else
would
the
argument
have
begun
unless
the
stranger
and
kathy
were
sure
he
said
as
if
he
had
known
it
all
along
you
mars
and
venus
he
could
feel
cold
death
approaching
chapter
ten
william
forrester
sat
quite
alone
in
the
room
which
had
been
given
him
on
mount
olympus
he
stared
out
of
the
window
a
little
smaller
than
the
window
in
venus
rooms
at
the
grecian
plain
far
below
without
actually
seeing
there
was
no
vertigo
this
time
small
matters
like
that
bother
him
the
whole
room
was
rather
a
small
one
as
gods
rooms
went
but
it
had
the
same
varicolored
shifting
walls
the
same
furniture
that
appeared
when
you
approached
it
forrester
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
now
and
he
did
know
if
it
was
going
to
do
him
any
good
he
peered
down
trying
to
discern
the
patrolling
myrmidons
around
the
base
and
lower
slopes
of
the
mountain
placed
there
to
discourage
overeager
climbers
from
trying
to
reach
the
home
of
the
gods
of
course
he
could
see
them
and
after
a
while
he
lost
interest
again
matters
were
too
serious
to
allow
time
for
that
kind
of
game
the
autumn
bacchanal
was
over
a
thing
of
the
past
on
the
way
to
the
distortion
of
legend
forrester
greatest
triumph
had
ended
in
his
greatest
fiasco
he
closed
his
eyes
as
he
sat
in
his
room
the
fluctuating
colors
on
the
walls
going
unappreciated
he
had
nothing
to
do
now
except
wait
for
the
final
judgment
of
the
gods
at
first
he
had
been
terrified
but
terror
could
only
last
so
long
and
as
the
time
ticked
by
the
idea
of
that
coming
judgment
had
almost
stopped
troubling
his
mind
either
he
had
passed
the
tests
or
he
had
there
was
no
point
in
worrying
about
the
inevitable
he
felt
anesthetized
numb
to
any
sensation
of
personal
danger
there
was
nothing
whatever
he
could
do
the
gods
had
him
very
well
let
the
gods
worry
about
what
to
do
with
him
freed
his
mind
turned
over
and
over
a
problem
that
seemed
new
to
him
at
first
gradually
he
realized
it
was
new
at
all
it
had
been
somewhere
in
the
back
of
his
thoughts
from
the
very
first
when
venus
had
told
him
that
he
had
been
chosen
as
a
double
for
dionysus
so
many
months
ago
it
seemed
like
years
to
forrester
and
yet
at
the
same
time
like
no
more
than
hours
so
much
had
happened
and
so
much
had
changed
but
the
question
had
remained
waiting
until
he
could
look
at
it
and
work
with
it
now
he
could
face
that
strange
doubt
in
his
mind
the
doubt
that
had
colored
everything
since
his
introduction
to
the
gods
that
had
grown
as
his
training
in
had
progressed
and
that
was
now
for
the
first
time
coming
to
full
consciousness
every
time
it
had
come
near
the
surface
before
this
day
he
had
expelled
it
from
his
mind
forcefully
getting
rid
of
it
without
realizing
fully
that
he
was
doing
so
and
perhaps
he
thought
the
doubt
had
begun
even
earlier
than
that
perhaps
he
had
always
doubted
and
never
allowed
himself
to
think
about
the
doubt
the
floor
of
his
mind
seemed
to
open
and
he
was
falling
falling
but
where
the
doubt
had
begun
was
unimportant
now
it
was
present
it
had
grown
that
was
all
that
mattered
he
could
find
facts
to
feed
the
doubt
and
strengthen
it
and
he
looked
at
the
facts
one
by
one
first
there
was
the
angry
conversation
between
mars
and
venus
on
the
night
of
the
bacchanal
he
could
still
hear
what
mars
had
said
worse
than
your
and
then
he
shut
venus
up
before
she
gave
away
too
much
realizing
maybe
that
he
had
given
away
a
good
deal
himself
that
one
little
sentence
was
enough
to
bring
everything
into
question
forrester
thought
he
had
wondered
why
it
had
been
necessary
to
have
a
double
for
dionysus
but
he
had
actually
thought
about
it
maybe
he
had
wanted
to
think
about
it
but
now
with
the
notion
of
a
predecessor
for
venus
in
his
mind
he
to
think
about
it
and
the
only
conclusion
he
could
come
to
was
a
disturbing
one
it
did
more
than
disturb
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
frightened
him
he
wanted
desperately
to
find
some
flaw
in
the
conclusion
he
faced
because
he
feared
it
even
more
than
he
feared
the
coming
judgment
of
the
pantheon
but
there
was
any
flaw
the
facts
meshed
together
entirely
too
well
to
be
an
accidental
pattern
in
the
first
place
he
thought
why
had
he
been
picked
for
the
job
he
was
a
nobody
of
no
importance
with
no
special
gifts
why
did
he
deserve
the
honor
of
taking
his
place
beside
hercules
and
achilles
and
odysseus
and
the
other
great
heroes
forrester
knew
he
was
any
hero
but
what
gave
him
his
standing
and
he
went
on
there
was
a
second
place
in
the
months
of
his
training
he
had
met
fourteen
of
the
gods
all
of
them
except
for
dionysus
now
what
kind
of
sense
did
that
make
anyone
who
going
to
have
a
double
usually
trains
the
double
himself
if
it
at
all
possible
or
at
the
very
least
he
allows
the
double
to
watch
his
actions
so
that
the
double
can
do
a
really
competent
job
of
imitation
and
if
an
imitation
is
all
that
needed
why
not
hire
an
actor
instead
of
a
history
professor
vulcan
had
told
him
you
were
picked
not
merely
for
your
physical
resemblance
to
dionysus
but
your
psychological
resemblance
as
well
that
had
to
be
true
if
only
because
as
far
as
forrester
could
see
nobody
had
the
slightest
reason
to
lie
about
it
but
why
should
it
be
true
what
advantage
did
the
gods
get
out
of
that
psychological
resemblance
all
he
was
supposed
to
be
was
a
double
and
anybody
who
like
dionysus
would
be
accepted
dionysus
by
the
people
the
psychological
resemblance
did
have
a
single
thing
to
do
with
it
mars
venus
vulcan
even
zeus
had
dropped
clues
zeus
had
referred
to
him
as
a
substitute
for
dionysus
a
substitute
he
realized
with
a
kind
of
horror
was
not
at
all
the
same
thing
as
a
double
the
answer
was
perfectly
clear
but
there
were
even
more
facts
to
bolster
it
why
had
he
been
tested
for
instance
he
had
been
made
a
in
spite
of
what
vulcan
had
said
was
he
slated
for
further
honors
if
he
passed
the
new
tests
he
was
sure
that
vulcan
had
been
telling
the
truth
as
far
as
he
gone
but
it
had
been
the
whole
truth
forrester
was
certain
of
that
now
and
what
was
it
that
venus
had
said
during
that
argument
with
mars
something
about
not
killing
forrester
because
then
they
would
have
to
get
another
another
another
no
there
was
no
escape
from
the
simple
and
obvious
conclusion
dionysus
was
either
missing
which
was
bad
enough
or
something
much
worse
he
was
dead
forrester
shivered
the
idea
of
an
immortal
god
dying
was
in
one
way
as
horrible
a
notion
as
he
could
imagine
but
in
another
way
it
seemed
to
make
a
good
deal
of
sense
as
far
as
plain
william
forrester
had
been
concerned
the
contradiction
in
the
notion
of
a
dead
immortal
would
have
made
it
ridiculous
to
start
with
but
the
dionysus
had
a
somewhat
different
slant
on
things
after
all
as
vulcan
had
told
him
a
could
die
and
if
that
was
true
then
why
could
a
god
die
too
perhaps
it
would
take
quite
a
lot
to
kill
a
god
but
the
difference
would
be
one
of
degree
not
of
kind
it
seemed
wholly
logical
and
it
led
forrester
saw
to
a
new
conclusion
one
that
required
a
little
less
effort
to
face
than
he
thought
it
would
it
should
have
shaken
the
foundations
of
his
childhood
and
left
him
dizzy
but
somehow
it
did
how
long
he
asked
himself
had
he
been
secretly
doubting
the
fact
that
the
gods
were
gods
at
least
in
the
sense
they
pretended
to
be
the
gods
were
not
gods
at
all
they
were
something
else
but
what
where
did
they
come
from
were
they
actually
the
gods
of
ancient
greece
as
they
claimed
forrester
wanted
to
throw
that
claim
out
with
the
rest
but
when
he
thought
things
over
he
did
see
why
he
should
to
an
almost
indestructible
being
three
thousand
years
may
only
be
a
long
time
so
the
gods
actually
were
gods
at
least
as
far
as
longevity
went
but
the
decision
did
get
him
very
far
there
were
still
a
lot
of
questions
unanswered
and
no
way
that
he
could
see
of
answering
them
or
rather
there
was
one
way
but
it
was
hellishly
dangerous
he
had
no
business
even
thinking
about
he
was
in
enough
hot
water
already
nevertheless
what
more
harm
could
he
do
to
his
chances
after
the
bacchanal
fiasco
there
was
probably
a
sentence
of
death
hanging
over
his
head
anyhow
and
they
could
do
any
more
to
him
than
kill
him
it
was
ridiculous
he
told
himself
with
a
return
of
caution
and
sanity
but
the
notion
came
back
nagging
at
his
mind
and
at
last
it
took
a
new
form
the
gods
had
the
rest
of
the
information
he
needed
he
had
to
go
to
one
of
them
but
which
one
his
first
thought
was
venus
but
after
a
moment
of
thought
he
ruled
her
regretfully
out
as
a
possibility
after
all
there
was
mars
mention
of
her
predecessor
if
that
meant
anything
it
meant
that
the
current
venus
was
the
original
one
she
would
have
a
lot
less
information
than
one
of
the
original
gods
there
were
any
originals
left
he
tabled
that
thought
hurriedly
and
went
on
vulcan
had
told
him
at
least
a
part
of
the
truth
and
vulcan
looked
like
a
good
bet
forrester
did
like
the
idea
of
bearding
the
artisan
in
his
workshop
it
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
and
after
a
while
he
put
his
finger
on
the
reason
his
little
liaison
with
venus
made
him
feel
guilty
there
was
he
knew
no
real
reason
for
it
in
the
first
place
he
had
known
the
girl
was
venus
and
in
the
second
place
she
may
not
have
been
the
same
one
who
had
been
vulcan
original
wife
thirty
and
more
centuries
ago
but
the
guilt
remained
and
he
tabled
vulcan
for
the
time
being
and
went
on
morpheus
hera
and
most
of
the
others
he
passed
by
without
a
glance
there
was
no
reason
for
them
to
dislike
him
but
there
was
no
reason
for
comradeship
either
mars
popped
into
his
mind
and
popped
right
out
again
that
would
be
putting
his
head
in
the
lion
mouth
with
a
vengeance
no
there
was
only
one
left
the
obvious
choice
the
one
who
had
helped
him
throughout
his
training
period
diana
she
genuinely
seemed
to
like
him
she
was
also
a
good
kid
the
thought
alone
was
almost
enough
to
make
him
smile
fondly
and
would
have
if
he
had
not
remembered
the
peril
he
was
in
he
turned
away
from
the
window
to
look
at
the
wall
across
the
room
he
had
remained
in
his
room
ever
since
mars
and
venus
had
brought
him
back
from
new
york
and
he
was
at
all
sure
that
he
could
leave
it
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word
the
place
had
neither
exits
nor
entrances
the
only
way
of
getting
in
or
out
of
the
place
was
via
the
veils
of
heaven
matter
transmitters
not
something
supernatural
he
realized
now
as
far
as
forrester
knew
they
still
worked
but
the
gods
could
generate
a
veil
anywhere
at
any
time
forrester
as
a
could
only
will
one
into
existence
on
sufferance
he
could
only
work
the
veils
if
the
gods
permitted
him
to
do
so
if
they
did
he
was
trapped
well
he
told
himself
there
was
one
way
to
find
out
he
walked
over
to
the
wall
and
stood
a
few
feet
away
from
it
concentrating
in
the
way
he
had
been
taught
he
was
still
slower
at
it
than
the
gods
themselves
and
had
developed
the
knack
of
forming
a
veil
as
he
walked
toward
the
place
where
he
wanted
it
to
be
as
they
had
but
he
knew
he
could
do
it
if
he
was
still
allowed
to
minutes
went
by
then
as
the
blue
sheet
of
neural
energy
flickered
into
being
forrester
slumped
in
sudden
relief
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
closed
his
eyes
the
veil
was
there
but
was
it
what
he
hoped
or
a
trick
possibly
he
could
focus
the
other
terminal
where
he
wanted
it
but
there
was
also
the
chance
that
the
gods
had
set
the
thing
up
so
that
when
he
stepped
through
he
would
be
standing
in
the
court
of
the
gods
facing
a
tribunal
for
which
he
was
totally
unprepared
it
would
be
just
like
the
pantheon
he
thought
to
pull
a
lousy
trick
like
that
but
there
was
no
point
in
dithering
if
death
was
to
be
his
fate
that
would
be
that
he
could
do
nothing
at
all
by
sitting
in
his
room
and
waiting
for
them
to
come
and
get
him
he
focused
the
exit
terminal
in
diana
apartment
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
focus
worked
or
not
until
he
stepped
through
he
opened
his
eyes
and
walked
into
the
veil
he
felt
almost
disappointed
when
he
looked
around
him
he
had
steeled
himself
to
do
great
battle
with
the
gods
and
instead
he
was
where
he
had
wanted
to
be
in
diana
apartment
she
was
standing
with
her
back
to
him
and
forrester
did
make
a
sound
not
wanting
to
startle
the
goddess
she
was
totally
unclad
her
glorious
body
shining
in
the
light
of
the
room
her
hair
unbound
and
falling
halfway
down
her
gently
curved
back
but
she
must
have
heard
him
somehow
for
she
turned
and
for
half
a
second
she
stood
facing
him
forrester
did
not
move
he
could
even
breathe
every
magnificent
curve
was
highlighted
in
a
frozen
tableau
then
there
was
a
sudden
flash
of
white
and
she
was
clad
in
a
clinging
which
forrester
saw
served
only
to
remind
one
of
what
one
had
recently
seen
it
worked
very
well
although
forrester
did
not
think
he
had
any
need
for
an
aid
to
his
memory
my
goodness
diana
said
you
should
surprise
a
girl
like
that
i
mean
you
really
gave
me
a
shock
kid
forrester
took
his
first
breath
well
he
said
i
could
be
dishonest
not
to
mention
ungallant
and
tell
you
i
was
sorry
but
diana
said
being
of
sound
mind
and
sound
body
i
a
long
way
from
being
sorry
and
diana
dropped
her
eyes
and
blushed
forrester
could
barely
believe
it
but
it
did
show
a
part
of
the
goddess
personality
that
was
entirely
new
to
him
he
was
sure
that
any
of
the
gods
or
goddesses
could
sense
when
a
veil
of
heaven
was
forming
near
them
and
get
prepared
before
it
was
well
enough
developed
to
allow
for
passage
but
diana
who
was
after
all
one
of
the
traditionally
virgin
goddesses
like
pallas
athena
had
chosen
to
pretend
surprise
forrester
had
a
further
hunch
too
he
thought
she
might
have
deliberately
vanished
her
only
a
second
or
so
before
he
entered
and
that
put
a
different
and
a
very
interesting
face
on
things
not
to
mention
he
thought
an
entire
figure
but
he
did
say
anything
that
was
his
main
business
in
apartment
instead
he
watched
her
smile
briskly
and
say
well
here
anyhow
kid
and
i
guess
that
enough
for
me
want
a
drink
i
could
whip
up
some
nectar
and
maybe
an
ambrosia
sandwich
i
take
the
drink
forrester
said
i
not
really
hungry
thanks
diana
held
out
her
hands
fingers
curved
inward
and
a
crystal
cup
of
clear
golden
liquid
appeared
in
each
matter
transmission
of
course
not
magic
she
handed
one
over
to
forrester
who
took
it
and
looked
the
goddess
straight
in
the
eyes
thanks
he
said
diana
i
got
some
questions
to
ask
you
and
i
hope
i
get
the
answers
she
touched
the
rim
of
her
cup
to
his
her
voice
was
very
soft
but
she
did
hesitate
in
the
least
i
answer
any
questions
i
have
to
sit
down
they
found
chairs
along
the
walls
of
the
room
and
sat
facing
one
another
forrester
took
a
sip
of
his
drink
settled
back
and
tried
to
think
where
to
begin
well
god
or
no
god
zeus
had
the
key
to
that
one
he
had
said
it
years
ago
and
it
had
passed
almost
into
legend
begin
at
the
beginning
go
on
until
you
reach
the
end
and
then
stop
very
well
forrester
thought
he
cleared
his
throat
diana
looked
at
him
inquiringly
i
do
know
how
far
into
the
noose
i
putting
my
head
with
this
one
diana
he
said
but
i
trust
you
and
i
got
to
ask
somebody
go
ahead
she
said
quietly
first
question
the
original
dionysus
is
dead
is
he
she
paused
for
a
moment
before
answering
yes
he
is
and
i
was
scheduled
to
take
his
place
that
right
as
a
full
god
forrester
said
diana
nodded
there
was
a
little
silence
diana
forrester
said
what
are
the
gods
she
got
up
and
crossed
to
the
window
looking
out
she
said
before
i
answer
that
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
we
are
men
and
women
he
said
more
or
less
human
like
myself
except
you
somehow
managed
to
get
so
far
ahead
of
any
kind
of
science
earth
knows
that
even
today
your
effects
can
only
be
explained
as
or
how
could
we
get
that
far
ahead
of
you
forrester
took
a
leap
in
the
dark
to
the
only
conclusion
he
could
see
you
not
from
earth
he
said
you
from
another
planet
the
words
sounded
strange
in
his
own
ears
but
diana
did
even
act
surprised
that
right
she
said
we
from
another
planet
or
rather
from
several
other
planets
forrester
exclaimed
but
oh
i
see
pan
for
instance
diana
nodded
pan
is
even
really
humanoid
his
home
is
a
planet
where
his
type
of
goatlike
life
evolved
neither
pluto
nor
neptune
is
humanoid
either
they
a
little
closer
than
pan
but
not
really
very
close
when
you
get
a
good
look
the
rest
of
the
gods
are
humanoid
but
not
human
wait
a
minute
forrester
said
venus
is
human
or
anyhow
she
a
replacement
just
the
way
i
was
slated
to
be
a
replacement
for
dionysus
diana
drained
her
cup
and
clapped
her
hands
together
on
it
the
cup
vanished
forrester
did
the
same
to
his
own
correct
she
said
venus
just
just
disappeared
once
they
got
an
etruscan
girl
to
replace
her
she
not
the
only
replacement
either
forrester
stared
who
else
you
tell
me
he
thought
the
list
of
gods
over
zeus
he
said
diana
smiled
yes
zeus
is
a
long
way
from
the
great
hero
of
the
legends
is
he
using
the
old
calendar
zeus
died
in
about
not
too
long
after
the
close
of
the
trojan
war
as
far
as
anybody
knows
neptune
did
the
actual
killing
but
it
pretty
clear
that
the
original
idea
was
his
hera
forrester
guessed
of
course
diana
said
what
she
wanted
was
a
figurehead
she
could
control
and
that
what
she
got
though
i
not
sure
she
entirely
happy
with
the
change
if
the
original
zeus
was
a
little
harder
to
control
at
least
he
seems
to
have
had
an
original
thought
now
and
again
forrester
sat
quietly
for
a
time
waiting
for
the
shock
to
pass
what
about
dionysus
diana
shrugged
he
well
as
far
as
anybody
ever
been
able
to
tell
it
was
suicide
about
three
years
ago
and
it
drove
hera
pretty
wild
trying
to
find
a
substitute
in
a
hurry
i
suspect
he
was
bored
with
the
wine
women
and
song
he
had
a
long
time
of
it
and
too
he
had
some
little
disagreements
with
hera
as
you
may
have
gathered
she
is
not
exactly
a
safe
person
to
have
as
an
enemy
he
probably
figured
get
him
sooner
or
later
so
he
might
as
well
save
her
the
trouble
and
hera
had
to
rush
to
get
a
replacement
why
could
there
just
have
been
some
sort
of
explanation
while
the
rest
of
you
ran
things
because
the
rest
of
us
could
run
things
not
for
long
anyhow
all
a
question
of
power
power
forrester
said
everything
we
have
diana
said
is
derived
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
workings
of
one
machine
though
is
a
long
way
from
the
right
word
for
it
it
bears
about
as
much
resemblance
to
what
you
think
of
as
a
machine
as
a
television
set
does
to
a
window
there
just
is
a
word
for
it
in
any
language
you
know
and
all
the
gods
have
to
work
the
machine
at
once
something
like
that
diana
came
back
from
the
window
and
sat
down
facing
him
again
it
operates
through
the
nervous
systems
of
the
beings
in
circuit
with
it
each
one
of
them
in
contact
with
one
of
the
power
nodes
of
the
machine
and
if
one
of
the
nodes
is
unoccupied
then
the
machine
out
of
balance
it
will
run
for
a
while
but
eventually
it
will
simply
wreck
itself
every
one
of
the
fifteen
nodes
has
to
be
occupied
otherwise
chaos
forrester
nodded
so
when
dionysus
died
we
had
to
find
a
replacement
in
a
hurry
the
machine
been
running
out
of
balance
for
about
as
long
as
it
can
stand
right
now
forrester
closed
his
eyes
i
not
sure
i
get
the
picture
well
look
at
it
this
way
suppose
you
have
a
wheel
all
right
forrester
said
obligingly
i
have
a
wheel
and
this
wheel
has
fifteen
weights
on
it
they
spaced
equally
around
the
rim
and
the
wheel
revolving
at
high
speed
forrester
kept
his
eyes
closed
when
he
had
the
wheel
nicely
spinning
he
said
okay
now
what
well
diana
said
as
long
as
the
weights
stay
in
place
the
wheel
spins
evenly
but
if
you
remove
one
of
the
weights
the
wheel
out
of
balance
it
starts
to
wobble
forrester
took
one
of
the
weights
dionysus
a
rather
large
jolly
weight
off
the
wheel
in
his
mind
it
wobbled
right
he
said
it
can
take
the
wobble
for
a
little
while
but
unless
the
balance
is
restored
in
time
the
wheel
will
eventually
break
hurriedly
forrester
put
dionysus
back
on
the
wheel
the
wobble
stopped
oh
he
said
i
see
our
power
machine
works
in
that
sort
of
way
that
is
it
requires
all
fifteen
occupants
dionysus
has
been
dead
for
three
years
now
and
that
about
the
outside
limit
unless
he
replaced
soon
the
machine
will
be
ruined
forrester
opened
his
eyes
the
wheel
spun
away
and
disappeared
so
you
found
me
to
replace
dionysus
i
had
to
look
like
him
so
the
mortals
would
see
any
difference
and
the
psychological
similarity
that
right
diana
said
it
the
same
as
the
wheel
again
if
you
remove
a
weight
you
got
to
put
back
a
weight
of
the
same
magnitude
otherwise
the
wheel
still
out
of
balance
and
since
the
power
machine
works
through
the
nervous
system
the
governing
factor
is
that
similarity
you
got
to
be
of
the
same
magnitude
as
dionysus
of
course
you
do
have
to
be
an
copy
the
machine
can
be
adjusted
for
differences
i
see
forrester
said
and
the
fifteen
power
nodes
another
idea
occurred
to
him
wait
a
minute
if
there
are
only
fifteen
power
nodes
then
how
come
there
were
so
many
different
gods
and
goddesses
among
the
greeks
there
were
a
lot
more
than
fifteen
back
then
of
course
there
were
diana
said
but
they
were
real
gods
as
a
matter
of
fact
some
of
them
did
really
exist
forrester
frowned
how
that
again
they
were
just
disguises
for
one
of
the
regular
fifteen
aesculapius
for
instance
the
old
god
of
medicine
was
in
disguise
he
took
the
name
in
honor
of
a
physician
of
the
time
he
would
have
raised
the
man
to
but
aesculapius
died
unexpectedly
and
we
thought
taking
his
into
the
pantheon
was
good
public
relations
how
about
the
others
forrester
said
they
were
all
disguises
were
they
of
course
not
some
of
them
were
just
like
yourself
their
power
was
derived
like
yours
from
the
pantheon
instead
of
directly
through
the
machine
and
then
there
were
the
satyrs
and
centaurs
and
suchlike
beings
that
was
public
relations
too
mainly
zeus
idea
i
understand
the
original
zeus
of
course
of
course
forrester
said
the
satyrs
and
such
were
artificial
created
maintained
and
controlled
by
the
machine
itself
it
equipped
with
what
you
might
call
a
cybernetic
brain
although
that
pretty
inadequate
as
a
description
vulcan
could
do
a
better
job
of
explaining
perfectly
all
right
i
do
understand
that
kind
of
thing
anyhow
well
in
that
case
let
me
put
it
this
way
the
machine
controlled
these
artificial
forms
but
they
could
be
taken
over
by
any
one
of
the
gods
or
for
special
purposes
as
i
say
it
was
public
relations
and
a
good
way
to
keep
the
populace
impressed
and
under
control
the
creatures
are
around
nowadays
forrester
pointed
out
nowadays
we
do
need
them
diana
said
there
are
other
methods
better
public
relations
i
suppose
forrester
did
know
he
was
going
to
ask
his
next
question
until
he
heard
himself
doing
so
but
it
was
the
question
he
really
wanted
to
ask
he
knew
that
as
soon
as
he
knew
he
asked
it
why
he
said
diana
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
why
what
do
you
mean
why
go
on
being
gods
why
dominate
humanity
i
suppose
i
could
answer
your
question
with
another
question
why
not
but
i
wo
instead
let
me
remind
you
of
some
things
look
what
done
during
the
last
century
the
great
wars
that
wrecked
europe
you
do
see
any
possibility
of
more
of
those
do
you
and
the
threat
of
atomic
war
is
gone
too
is
it
well
yes
forrester
said
but
but
we
still
have
wars
diana
said
sure
we
do
the
male
animal
just
would
be
happy
if
he
did
have
a
chance
to
go
out
and
get
himself
blown
to
bits
once
in
a
while
do
ask
to
explain
that
i
not
a
male
forrester
agreed
silently
diana
was
not
a
male
it
was
the
most
understated
statement
he
had
ever
heard
but
anyhow
diana
said
they
want
wars
so
they
have
wars
mars
sees
that
the
wars
stay
small
and
keep
within
the
martian
conventions
though
so
any
really
widespread
damage
or
destruction
or
any
wanton
attacks
on
civilians
are
a
thing
of
the
past
and
it
not
only
wars
kid
it
everything
what
do
you
mean
everything
man
needs
a
god
a
personal
god
when
he
does
have
one
ready
to
hand
he
makes
one
up
and
look
at
the
havoc
that
has
caused
a
god
of
vengeance
a
god
who
cheers
you
on
to
kill
your
enemies
studied
history
tell
me
about
the
gods
of
various
nations
tell
me
about
thor
and
baal
and
the
original
bloodthirsty
yahweh
people
gods
now
wait
a
minute
forrester
objected
the
chinese
oh
sure
diana
said
there
are
exceptions
but
you
ca
bank
on
the
exceptions
if
you
want
a
reasonably
safe
sane
and
happy
humanity
then
you
better
make
sure
your
gods
are
not
going
to
start
screaming
for
war
against
the
neighbors
or
against
the
infidels
or
against
well
against
anybody
and
everybody
there
only
one
way
to
make
sure
kid
we
found
that
way
we
the
gods
forrester
digested
that
one
slowly
it
sounds
great
but
it
pretty
altruistic
and
while
i
do
want
to
impugn
anybody
motives
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
we
ought
to
be
getting
something
out
of
it
ourselves
above
and
beyond
the
pure
joy
of
helping
humanity
sure
you
perfectly
right
and
we
get
something
out
of
it
like
what
diana
grinned
she
looked
more
like
a
tomboy
than
ever
before
fun
she
said
and
you
know
it
do
tell
me
you
did
get
a
kick
out
of
playing
god
at
the
bacchanal
well
forrester
confessed
yes
he
sighed
and
i
guess
that
bacchanal
is
going
to
be
the
one
really
high
spot
in
a
very
shortened
sort
of
life
diana
sat
upright
what
are
you
talking
about
what
else
would
i
be
talking
about
the
bacchanal
you
know
what
happened
you
must
know
everybody
must
by
now
mars
is
probably
demanding
my
head
from
hera
right
now
unless
he
got
more
complicated
ideas
like
taking
me
apart
limb
by
limb
i
remember
he
mentioned
that
diana
stood
up
and
came
over
to
forrester
why
would
mars
do
something
like
that
and
especially
now
and
what
makes
you
think
hera
would
go
along
with
him
if
he
did
why
not
now
that
i
failed
my
tests
diana
cried
you
failed
forrester
stood
up
shakily
of
course
i
have
after
what
happened
at
the
bacchanal
i
do
pay
any
attention
to
that
diana
said
mars
is
a
louse
always
has
been
i
hear
nobody
likes
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
just
passed
your
finals
the
last
test
was
to
see
if
you
could
figure
out
who
we
were
and
you
done
that
have
you
there
was
a
long
taut
silence
then
diana
laughed
your
face
looks
the
way
mine
must
have
over
three
thousand
years
ago
what
are
you
talking
about
still
dazed
he
was
quite
sure
he
had
heard
her
rightly
when
they
told
me
the
same
thing
after
the
original
diana
was
killed
in
a
accident
frankly
she
seems
to
have
been
too
independent
to
suit
hera
and
i
passed
my
own
finals
i
she
stopped
now
do
look
at
me
like
that
diana
said
and
pull
yourself
together
because
we
got
to
get
to
the
final
investiture
but
all
true
i
a
substitute
too
chapter
eleven
the
great
god
dionysus
lord
of
the
vine
ruler
of
the
revels
master
of
the
planting
and
the
harvest
bestower
of
the
golden
touch
overseer
of
the
poor
comforter
of
the
worker
and
patron
of
the
drunkard
sat
silently
in
a
cheap
bar
on
lower
third
avenue
new
york
slowly
imbibing
his
seventh
it
tasted
anything
but
satisfactory
as
it
went
down
he
preferred
vodka
or
even
gin
but
after
all
he
asked
himself
if
a
god
could
be
loyal
to
his
own
products
then
who
could
he
was
dressed
in
an
inexpensive
brown
suit
and
his
face
did
not
look
like
that
of
dionysus
or
even
of
william
forrester
though
neatly
turned
out
he
looked
a
little
like
an
bookkeeper
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
been
out
of
work
for
very
long
of
a
he
thought
a
god
has
to
skulk
in
some
cheap
bar
just
because
some
other
god
has
it
in
for
but
that
unfortunately
was
the
way
mars
was
it
did
matter
to
him
that
none
of
what
happened
had
been
forrester
fault
in
the
first
place
forrester
had
known
that
the
girl
at
the
bacchanal
had
been
venus
until
it
was
much
too
late
for
apologies
in
the
second
place
he
had
even
picked
her
he
kept
his
promise
not
to
use
his
powers
on
the
spinning
figure
of
mr
bottle
symes
but
venus
had
made
no
such
promise
venus
had
rigged
the
game
but
try
explaining
that
to
mars
he
did
seem
to
mind
what
went
on
at
the
revels
of
aphrodite
being
goddess
of
love
was
her
line
of
work
and
even
mars
appeared
to
recognize
that
much
but
he
did
like
the
idea
of
any
extracurricular
work
especially
with
other
gods
and
if
anything
occurred
he
mars
was
sure
damned
well
going
to
find
out
about
it
and
see
that
something
was
done
about
it
yes
sir
forrester
finished
his
drink
and
stared
at
the
empty
glass
it
had
all
begun
on
the
day
of
his
final
investiture
and
he
had
gone
through
every
event
in
memory
over
and
over
why
he
did
know
but
it
was
something
to
do
while
he
hid
it
had
been
anywhere
near
as
simple
as
the
investiture
he
had
gone
through
to
become
a
all
fourteen
of
the
other
gods
had
been
there
this
time
a
simple
quorum
was
enough
pluto
with
his
skin
casting
a
shade
of
gloom
about
him
had
slouched
into
the
court
of
the
gods
looking
at
everybody
and
everything
with
lackluster
eyes
had
come
in
more
briskly
smelling
of
fish
his
skin
pale
green
and
glistening
wet
his
fingers
and
toes
webbed
and
his
eyes
bulging
and
wide
phoebus
apollo
had
strolled
in
looking
authentically
like
a
greek
god
face
and
figure
unbelievably
perfect
and
a
pleased
stupid
smile
spread
all
over
his
countenance
slim
and
wily
with
a
foxy
face
and
quick
movements
had
slipped
in
silently
and
all
the
others
had
been
there
too
mars
looked
grim
but
when
forrester
was
formally
proposed
for
godhood
mars
made
no
objection
the
entire
pantheon
had
then
gone
through
a
veil
of
heaven
to
a
room
forrester
just
could
remember
fully
at
the
time
his
eyes
simply
refused
to
make
sense
out
of
the
place
now
of
course
he
understood
why
it
did
really
exist
in
the
framework
he
was
used
to
instead
it
was
partially
a
superimposed
on
normal
space
if
not
perfectly
simple
at
least
the
explanation
made
matters
rational
rather
than
supernatural
but
at
the
time
everything
seemed
to
take
place
in
a
chaotic
dream
world
where
infinite
distance
and
the
space
next
to
him
seemed
one
and
the
same
he
knew
then
why
diana
had
told
him
that
the
word
machine
could
not
describe
the
gods
power
source
he
had
been
seated
there
in
the
dream
room
but
it
was
exactly
sitting
every
spatial
configuration
took
on
strange
properties
in
that
and
he
seemed
to
float
in
a
place
that
had
neither
dimension
nor
direction
the
other
gods
had
all
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
front
of
him
all
together
and
all
at
once
yet
at
the
same
time
each
had
been
separate
and
distinct
from
the
others
he
wanted
to
close
his
eyes
but
he
had
been
warned
against
doing
that
grimly
he
kept
them
open
and
then
the
indescribable
began
to
happen
it
was
as
though
every
nerve
in
his
body
had
been
indissolubly
linked
to
the
great
source
of
it
was
pure
hellish
torture
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
the
most
exquisite
pleasure
he
had
ever
known
he
could
not
imagine
how
long
it
went
on
but
eventually
it
ended
he
was
and
then
it
had
been
over
and
a
banquet
had
been
held
in
his
honor
a
celebration
for
the
new
god
everyone
seemed
to
enjoy
the
occasion
and
forrester
himself
had
been
feeling
pretty
good
until
mars
smiling
a
smile
that
only
touched
his
lips
and
left
his
eyes
as
cold
and
hard
as
anything
forrester
had
ever
seen
had
come
up
to
him
and
said
softly
all
right
dionysus
you
a
god
now
i
did
touch
you
before
because
we
needed
you
and
i
do
intend
to
kill
you
now
replacements
are
too
hard
to
find
i
only
going
to
beat
you
to
within
an
inch
of
your
damned
immortal
life
just
remember
that
buster
and
then
the
smile
still
set
on
his
face
he
had
turned
and
swaggered
away
forrester
had
thought
of
vulcan
mars
was
a
killer
in
spite
of
his
tactics
he
had
too
good
a
military
mind
to
discipline
a
valuable
man
to
death
but
he
was
more
than
willing
to
go
as
near
to
that
point
as
possible
if
he
thought
it
justified
and
what
he
allowed
as
justification
resided
in
a
code
all
his
own
right
was
what
was
good
for
mars
wrong
was
what
disturbed
him
that
was
the
code
as
simple
as
black
and
white
as
you
could
ask
for
vulcan
was
one
of
the
results
vulcan
had
been
venus
lawful
husband
as
far
as
the
laws
of
the
gods
went
that
did
matter
to
mars
when
he
wanted
venus
he
had
thrashed
vulcan
and
the
beating
had
left
permanent
damage
the
damage
was
translated
into
vulcan
limp
any
god
ability
to
heal
himself
through
the
machine
power
was
dependent
on
the
god
own
mentality
and
outlook
and
vulcan
had
never
been
able
to
cure
his
limp
the
psychic
punishment
had
been
too
great
forrester
ordered
another
drink
and
tried
to
think
about
something
else
the
prospect
of
a
fight
with
mars
was
sometimes
a
little
too
much
for
him
to
handle
the
drink
arrived
and
he
sipped
at
it
vacantly
thinking
back
to
diana
and
her
story
of
the
gods
there
was
one
hole
in
it
a
hole
big
enough
to
toss
mount
olympus
through
he
realized
where
had
the
gods
gone
for
three
thousand
years
and
how
had
they
gotten
to
earth
in
the
first
place
those
two
unanswered
questions
were
enough
to
convince
forrester
that
in
spite
of
all
he
knew
and
in
spite
of
the
way
his
new
viewpoint
had
turned
his
universe
upside
down
in
a
matter
of
hours
he
still
have
the
whole
story
he
had
to
find
it
even
more
so
now
as
he
began
to
realize
that
the
human
race
deserved
more
than
just
the
security
and
happiness
that
the
gods
could
give
them
it
deserved
independence
and
the
chance
to
make
or
mar
its
own
future
protection
was
all
very
well
for
the
infancy
of
a
race
but
man
was
growing
up
now
man
needed
to
make
his
own
world
the
gods
had
no
place
in
that
world
forrester
saw
he
had
to
find
the
answers
to
all
of
his
questions
and
now
he
thought
he
knew
a
way
to
do
it
want
another
buddy
the
bartender
voice
roused
forrester
from
his
reverie
he
had
finished
number
eight
okay
forrester
said
sure
he
handed
the
bartender
a
bill
and
got
a
kind
of
wry
pleasure
out
of
seeing
the
picture
of
dionysus
on
its
face
let
have
another
but
more
brandy
and
less
soda
this
time
the
drink
was
brought
and
he
sipped
at
it
looking
like
any
ordinary
citizen
taking
on
a
small
load
but
tuned
to
every
fluctuation
in
the
energy
levels
around
him
waiting
only
a
god
he
knew
could
hurt
another
god
and
even
then
it
took
plenty
of
power
to
do
it
actually
to
kill
a
god
required
the
combined
efforts
of
more
than
one
under
normal
circumstances
though
one
properly
equipped
and
with
some
luck
could
manage
it
as
far
as
his
own
situation
was
concerned
forrester
was
prepared
for
a
deadly
assault
from
mars
maybe
mars
did
intend
to
kill
him
but
being
maimed
for
centuries
like
vulcan
was
nothing
to
look
forward
to
and
it
was
just
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
just
in
case
the
god
of
war
had
managed
to
get
one
or
two
other
gods
on
his
side
forrester
had
talked
to
diana
and
venus
and
had
their
agreement
to
step
in
on
his
side
if
things
got
rough
or
if
mars
tried
to
pull
anything
underhanded
and
any
minute
now
suddenly
forrester
felt
a
disturbance
in
the
energy
flow
around
him
somewhere
behind
him
invisible
to
the
mortals
who
occupied
the
bar
a
veil
of
heaven
was
beginning
to
form
with
a
fraction
of
a
second
forrester
was
forming
his
own
but
this
time
he
took
a
little
longer
than
he
had
before
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
to
run
for
over
a
month
now
he
had
been
jumping
from
place
to
place
all
over
the
world
he
had
gone
to
hong
kong
first
when
mars
had
traced
him
there
and
made
a
grab
for
him
forrester
had
made
a
quick
jump
via
veil
to
durban
south
africa
it
had
taken
mars
all
of
hours
to
find
forrester
hiding
in
the
native
quarter
wearing
the
of
a
negro
laborer
but
again
forrester
had
disappeared
this
time
reappearing
in
lima
peru
and
so
it
had
gone
for
five
full
weeks
with
forrester
keeping
barely
one
jump
ahead
of
the
god
of
war
and
in
that
month
he
had
achieved
two
important
things
first
he
had
begun
to
make
mars
a
little
overconfident
by
now
mars
was
fully
convinced
that
forrester
was
nothing
but
a
coward
and
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
he
could
beat
the
newcomer
easily
if
he
could
only
come
to
grips
with
him
second
forrester
had
discovered
that
mars
basic
reflexes
were
a
trifle
slower
than
his
own
if
mars
had
been
able
to
form
his
own
veil
and
step
through
it
in
time
to
sense
the
last
fading
glimmers
of
forrester
veil
he
would
have
been
able
to
follow
immediately
instead
he
had
to
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
finding
forrester
over
and
over
again
that
meant
slower
reflexes
and
that
forrester
thought
might
just
give
him
the
edge
he
needed
but
this
time
forrester
was
going
to
let
mars
follow
him
slow
reflexes
and
all
this
time
he
waited
that
extra
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
stepped
through
the
veil
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
great
rain
forest
around
him
towered
trees
whose
great
trunks
reached
up
to
a
leafy
sky
the
place
was
dark
little
sunlight
came
through
the
roof
of
leaves
and
curling
vines
a
bird
screamed
somewhere
in
the
distance
sounding
like
a
lost
soul
in
agony
the
sound
was
repeated
and
then
there
was
silence
forrester
was
exactly
where
he
had
intended
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
amazon
jungle
he
had
time
for
one
look
around
then
mars
stepped
out
of
a
shimmering
veil
only
yards
away
from
where
forrester
was
standing
immediately
forrester
felt
mars
throw
out
a
suppressor
field
that
would
keep
him
from
forming
another
veil
he
did
the
same
thing
now
as
long
as
both
held
their
respective
fields
neither
could
leave
greetings
forrester
said
the
bird
screamed
again
mars
ignored
it
you
just
a
little
too
slow
he
said
grinning
and
now
buster
you
going
to
get
it
and
get
it
good
who
forrester
said
me
mars
hissed
his
breath
in
and
fired
a
blast
of
energy
that
would
have
drilled
through
a
foot
of
armor
plate
but
forrester
blocked
it
the
splatter
of
free
energy
struck
at
the
nearby
trees
sending
them
crashing
to
the
ground
a
small
blaze
started
forrester
followed
the
blow
with
one
of
his
own
but
mars
parried
quickly
a
few
more
little
fires
began
in
the
vicinity
then
mars
bellowed
and
charged
by
the
time
he
reached
the
spot
where
forrester
had
been
forrester
was
fifty
feet
in
the
air
standing
with
his
arms
folded
and
looking
down
in
an
interested
manner
you
ought
to
watch
out
he
said
you
might
stumble
into
a
venus
flycatcher
down
there
i
mean
besides
the
one
you
got
already
mars
mouth
dropped
open
he
gave
vent
to
an
inarticulate
roar
of
rage
and
leaped
into
the
air
as
he
rose
toward
forrester
the
defender
closed
his
eyes
and
changed
shape
he
became
a
rock
and
dropped
he
bounced
off
mars
rising
forehead
with
a
great
noise
mars
roared
and
dived
for
the
stone
and
found
himself
holding
a
large
angry
tiger
but
an
old
trick
like
that
did
fool
mars
suddenly
finding
himself
fighting
with
another
tiger
as
ferocious
as
himself
began
clawing
and
biting
his
way
free
in
a
frenzy
of
panic
he
managed
to
make
it
just
long
enough
to
become
a
stone
again
dropping
toward
the
earth
for
a
moment
the
other
tiger
seemed
uncertain
then
catching
sight
of
the
falling
stone
he
became
an
eagle
and
went
after
it
with
a
scream
claws
outstretched
and
a
glitter
of
hatred
in
the
slitted
eyes
forrester
reached
the
ground
first
the
eagle
braked
madly
trying
to
escape
a
giant
kodiak
bear
forrester
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
battered
the
air
with
great
murderous
paws
mars
scooted
upward
already
changing
into
something
capable
of
coping
with
the
bear
a
huge
dragon
breathing
barrels
of
smoke
flapped
in
the
air
looking
all
around
for
its
opponent
it
did
not
notice
forrester
scurrying
away
in
the
shape
of
an
ant
through
the
leaves
and
thick
humus
of
the
jungle
floor
by
now
the
air
was
becoming
smoky
and
the
flames
were
licking
up
the
sides
of
trees
all
through
the
vicinity
and
racing
along
the
giant
vines
that
curled
around
them
the
dragon
belched
more
smoke
adding
to
the
general
confusion
and
roared
in
a
voice
like
thunder
coward
dionysus
come
out
and
fight
there
was
an
instant
of
crackling
silence
then
forrester
stepped
out
from
behind
a
blazing
tree
he
too
was
a
dragon
mars
snarled
breathed
smoke
and
made
a
power
dive
forrester
dodged
and
the
fangs
of
the
monster
missed
him
by
inches
mars
sank
into
the
ground
and
forrester
slammed
the
war
god
on
the
side
of
his
head
with
one
mighty
forepaw
mars
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
managed
to
jerk
himself
free
he
leaped
to
all
four
feet
glaring
at
forrester
with
great
bulging
eyes
man
to
man
you
bastard
he
said
in
a
roar
forrester
leaped
back
to
avoid
being
scorched
he
poured
out
some
smoke
of
his
own
mars
coughed
damn
it
no
more
the
war
god
thundered
fair
enough
forrester
shouted
he
changed
back
to
his
dionysian
form
circling
warily
until
mars
had
followed
suit
then
the
two
began
to
close
in
slowly
around
them
the
forest
burned
vegetation
even
on
the
swampy
ground
catching
fire
as
the
entire
vicinity
crackled
and
hissed
with
heat
neither
of
them
seemed
to
take
any
notice
of
the
fact
mars
was
a
trained
boxer
and
wrestler
forrester
knew
but
it
was
probably
a
good
many
centuries
since
he
had
any
real
workouts
and
forrester
was
counting
heavily
on
reflexes
those
would
give
him
a
slight
edge
at
any
rate
he
hoped
so
the
circling
ceased
as
mars
leaped
forward
suddenly
and
lashed
out
with
a
right
to
the
jaw
that
could
end
the
fight
but
forrester
moved
his
head
aside
just
in
time
and
the
fist
glanced
off
his
cheek
he
staggered
back
just
as
mars
followed
with
a
left
jab
to
the
belly
forrester
clamped
down
on
the
war
god
wrist
and
twisted
violently
pulling
mars
on
past
him
the
war
god
caught
off
balance
lunged
forward
tripping
over
his
own
feet
and
almost
fell
as
he
went
by
forrester
grinning
savagely
brought
his
right
hand
down
on
the
back
of
mars
neck
with
a
blow
whose
force
would
have
killed
an
elephant
outright
mars
however
was
no
mere
elephant
he
grunted
and
went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
shaking
his
head
groggily
but
he
was
out
not
quite
forrester
doubled
up
his
fist
as
mars
tried
to
rise
and
came
down
again
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
squarely
on
his
opponent
neck
there
was
a
satisfyingly
loud
crack
audible
even
in
the
roar
of
the
burning
forest
mars
collapsed
to
the
ground
smothering
small
fires
beneath
his
bulk
forrester
leaped
on
top
of
him
and
grabbed
his
head
beard
with
one
hand
and
hair
with
the
other
he
twisted
and
the
war
god
screamed
in
agony
forrester
relaxed
the
pressure
all
right
now
he
said
through
clenched
teeth
your
neck
broken
and
all
i
got
to
do
is
twist
enough
to
sever
your
spinal
column
you
be
crippled
for
as
long
as
vulcan
has
maybe
longer
mars
shrieked
again
i
yield
i
yield
forrester
held
on
not
just
yet
you
do
he
said
grimly
i
want
some
information
and
i
going
to
get
it
out
of
you
if
i
have
to
wring
them
out
vertebra
by
vertebra
mars
tried
to
buck
forrester
twisted
again
and
the
war
god
subsided
breathing
hard
at
last
he
muttered
what
do
you
want
to
know
why
did
you
and
the
other
gods
leave
earth
for
three
thousand
years
and
where
did
you
come
from
in
the
first
place
i
want
the
reason
chum
he
applied
a
little
pressure
just
as
a
reminder
i
tell
you
mars
screamed
i
tell
you
and
as
the
roaring
flames
crackled
in
the
amazon
forest
the
agonized
mars
began
to
talk
chapter
twelve
zeus
venus
diana
and
forrester
sat
in
the
court
of
the
gods
listening
to
a
large
individual
with
bright
red
eyes
and
two
long
white
fangs
coming
from
a
lipless
mouth
the
eyes
were
like
a
cat
with
slitted
pupils
and
the
general
expression
on
the
individual
face
was
one
of
feral
hatred
and
bestial
madness
however
as
he
had
explained
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
arrangement
of
his
features
he
was
he
kept
saying
only
interested
in
the
general
welfare
what
was
more
it
was
his
business
to
be
interested
he
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
cop
bor
mellistos
of
the
interstellar
police
my
rank
he
had
told
them
mildly
is
about
the
equivalent
of
your
detective
inspector
technically
he
was
saying
now
you
are
all
four
guilty
of
being
accessories
as
i
understand
your
local
law
phrases
it
however
he
smiled
it
made
him
look
unbelievably
horrible
forrester
tried
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
it
however
he
went
on
in
view
of
the
fact
that
none
of
you
could
possibly
have
known
that
you
were
in
fact
accessories
that
is
that
you
were
dealing
with
a
criminal
group
if
you
understand
me
plus
the
fact
that
forrester
as
soon
as
he
did
discover
the
facts
called
us
at
once
through
the
power
machine
i
feel
that
we
can
overlook
your
part
in
the
matter
venus
frowned
wait
a
minute
i
not
sure
i
understand
this
at
all
what
crime
are
the
gods
supposed
to
have
committed
not
crime
miss
bor
mellistos
said
his
eyes
twinkled
forrester
gulped
and
turned
away
crimes
misuse
of
a
neural
power
machine
for
one
and
the
domination
and
enslavement
of
a
less
advanced
intelligent
culture
for
another
both
those
are
very
serious
crimes
less
advanced
culture
forrester
said
you
mean
us
i
afraid
so
sir
bor
mellistos
said
you
see
all
the
members
of
my
culture
are
attuned
to
the
power
nodes
of
one
neural
machine
or
another
but
this
power
is
not
meant
to
be
misused
we
have
been
searching
for
this
group
for
a
long
time
now
and
you
first
got
wind
of
them
on
earth
about
three
thousand
years
ago
a
little
more
than
that
actually
bor
mellistos
said
if
you
mind
the
correction
not
at
all
forrester
said
looking
at
the
fangs
of
the
detective
inspector
we
were
alerted
after
the
radiations
had
been
coming
in
for
some
time
the
search
for
this
group
was
nearly
as
urgent
then
and
that
why
they
had
to
go
into
hiding
diana
asked
correct
miss
bor
mellistos
said
the
only
one
we
managed
to
catch
was
the
woman
calling
herself
aphrodite
or
venus
he
looked
at
the
substitute
venus
that
the
one
you
replaced
miss
how
did
you
catch
her
forrester
pursued
well
bor
mellistos
said
turning
a
faint
shade
of
orange
with
embarrassment
she
was
ah
engaged
in
a
secret
liaison
with
a
mortal
at
the
time
knowing
that
two
of
the
other
gentlemen
would
be
furious
with
her
if
they
discovered
this
fact
mars
and
vulcan
forrester
supplied
quite
correct
sir
bor
mellistos
said
knowing
as
i
say
that
they
would
be
furious
she
had
taken
special
pains
to
hide
herself
when
the
alarm
reached
the
others
that
we
were
coming
they
could
not
warn
her
as
a
result
when
she
returned
to
mount
olympus
we
were
waiting
for
her
serves
her
right
zeus
said
with
indignation
bor
mellistos
said
quite
very
politely
and
then
forrester
said
you
patrolled
this
place
for
a
while
bor
mellistos
nodded
we
left
about
three
hundred
years
ago
finally
deciding
that
they
had
gone
elsewhere
by
the
way
do
you
know
where
they
were
hiding
all
this
time
my
guess
diana
said
is
that
they
were
here
on
earth
of
course
naturally
miss
bor
mellistos
said
but
where
zeus
shrugged
all
sorts
of
places
i
ran
a
tailor
shop
myself
pressing
and
cleaning
i
understand
that
poseidon
and
pluto
entered
freak
shows
they
were
fine
attractions
too
pan
lived
mostly
in
the
forests
doing
well
enough
for
himself
running
wild
diana
and
athena
ran
a
small
hairdressing
studio
in
queens
and
venus
please
venus
interrupted
perfectly
honorable
profession
zeus
objected
one
of
the
oldest
perhaps
the
very
oldest
and
i
do
see
why
please
venus
insisted
zeus
shut
up
with
a
little
sigh
at
any
rate
bor
mellistos
said
that
the
story
up
to
date
and
now
there
only
the
question
of
the
overseer
positions
would
you
like
to
fill
them
who
venus
asked
well
bor
mellistos
said
you
have
the
experience
and
we
do
need
someone
to
take
over
you
see
three
thousand
years
ago
your
technical
attainments
were
not
large
there
was
little
need
for
an
overseer
now
however
you
are
nearly
at
the
stage
where
you
will
be
invited
to
join
the
galactic
federation
and
we
must
make
sure
you
do
not
do
any
irreparable
harm
to
yourselves
during
the
next
few
years
well
forrester
said
how
could
we
if
you
permit
me
sir
bor
mellistos
said
i
can
explain
you
would
work
much
as
the
gods
did
but
with
no
publicity
and
a
greater
sense
of
responsibility
if
you
understand
me
earth
would
never
know
you
were
there
i
have
to
stay
away
from
mortals
forrester
asked
exactly
bor
mellistos
said
well
forrester
thought
it
had
its
compensations
in
the
three
days
that
the
detective
inspector
had
been
on
earth
forrester
had
had
time
to
think
and
to
find
out
some
things
gerda
for
instance
was
getting
married
to
alvin
sherdlap
forrester
wondered
what
kind
of
love
would
let
a
woman
choose
a
name
like
gerda
sherdlap
and
decided
it
was
better
not
to
think
about
it
what
did
he
have
to
go
back
to
history
classes
students
even
students
like
maya
wilson
well
he
was
sure
he
could
do
better
than
that
he
looked
at
diana
and
became
even
surer
the
remaining
eleven
overseers
bor
mellistos
was
saying
will
be
along
shortly
you
will
then
be
able
to
draw
fully
on
the
machine
you
need
merely
follow
world
events
and
make
sure
that
any
ah
regrettably
decisions
are
not
made
your
actions
will
of
course
be
very
much
undercover
forrester
nodded
this
mass
arrest
of
the
gods
is
going
to
cause
an
upheaval
all
by
itself
quite
true
sir
but
that
will
be
worked
out
i
afraid
i
do
really
know
the
details
but
doubtless
the
other
eleven
who
are
coming
will
inform
you
more
thoroughly
on
that
score
forrester
sighed
about
the
gods
what
kind
of
punishment
will
they
receive
well
sir
bor
mellistos
said
it
varies
vulcan
for
instance
the
person
who
called
himself
vulcan
or
hephaestus
will
probably
get
off
with
a
lighter
sentence
than
the
others
he
was
a
mechanic
brought
along
under
some
duress
to
service
the
machine
but
the
sentences
will
be
severe
you
may
be
sure
very
severe
forrester
did
feel
like
asking
any
more
questions
about
that
there
was
a
pause
he
looked
at
diana
again
and
she
looked
back
at
him
do
you
accept
bor
mellistos
said
forrester
and
the
others
nodded
bor
mellistos
said
very
well
in
that
case
i
will
inform
the
other
eleven
overseers
already
picked
that
they
will
be
met
by
you
here
on
mount
olympus
and
that
but
forrester
was
listening
he
had
begun
whistling
very
softly
the
song
he
was
whistling
was
tenting
tonight
