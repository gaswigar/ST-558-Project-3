on
the
beach
lonesome
cove
is
one
of
the
least
frequented
stretches
on
the
new
england
seaboard
from
the
land
side
the
sheer
drop
of
hawkill
cliffs
shuts
it
off
access
by
water
is
denied
denied
with
a
show
of
menacing
teeth
when
the
sea
curls
its
lips
back
amid
a
swirl
of
angry
currents
from
its
rocks
and
reefs
warning
boats
away
there
is
no
settlement
near
the
cove
the
somber
repute
suggested
by
its
name
has
served
to
keep
cottagers
from
building
on
the
wildly
beautiful
uplands
that
overbrood
the
beach
sheep
browse
between
the
thickets
of
ash
and
wild
cherry
extending
almost
to
the
brink
of
the
height
and
the
straggling
pathways
along
the
edge
worn
by
the
feet
of
their
herders
afford
the
only
suggestion
of
human
traffic
within
half
a
mile
of
the
spot
a
ravine
leads
down
to
the
sea
by
a
rather
treacherous
descent
near
the
mouth
of
this
opening
a
considerable
gathering
of
folk
speckled
the
usually
deserted
beach
at
noon
of
july
sixth
they
centered
on
a
dark
object
a
few
yards
within
the
limit
some
scouted
about
peering
at
the
sand
others
pointed
first
to
the
sea
then
to
the
cliffs
with
the
open
gestures
of
those
who
argue
vehemently
but
always
their
eyes
returned
drawn
back
by
an
unfailing
magnetism
to
the
central
object
from
some
distance
away
a
lone
man
of
a
markedly
different
type
from
the
others
observed
them
with
an
expression
of
displeasure
he
had
reached
the
cove
by
an
arduous
scramble
possible
only
to
a
good
climber
around
the
jutting
elbow
of
the
cliff
to
the
northward
it
was
easily
to
be
read
in
his
face
that
he
was
both
surprised
and
annoyed
to
find
people
there
before
him
one
of
the
group
presently
detached
himself
and
ambled
over
to
the
newcomer
with
an
accelerated
speed
as
he
drew
nearer
swanny
he
ejaculated
if
it
ain
t
perfessor
kent
didn
t
know
you
at
first
under
them
whiskers
you
remember
me
don
t
you
i
used
to
drive
you
around
when
you
was
here
how
are
you
jarvis
returned
the
other
still
in
the
livery
business
i
suppose
yes
what
brings
you
here
perfessor
holidays
i
ve
just
come
out
of
the
woods
and
as
you
have
some
very
interesting
sea
currents
just
here
i
thought
i
d
have
a
look
at
them
nobody
really
knows
anything
about
coast
currents
you
know
now
my
opportunity
is
he
indicated
the
crowd
by
a
movement
of
his
head
spoilt
i
guess
not
you
couldn
t
have
come
at
a
better
time
said
the
local
man
eagerly
ah
but
you
see
i
had
planned
to
swim
out
to
the
eddy
and
make
some
personal
you
was
going
to
swim
into
dead
man
s
eddy
asked
the
other
aghast
why
perfessor
you
must
have
turned
foolish
they
ain
t
a
man
on
this
coast
would
take
a
chance
like
superstition
retorted
the
other
curtly
on
a
still
day
such
as
this
there
would
be
no
danger
to
an
experienced
swimmer
the
conditions
are
ideal
except
for
this
crowd
what
is
it
has
the
village
gone
picnicking
not
sca
cely
ain
t
you
heard
another
one
s
come
in
through
the
eddy
lies
over
professor
kent
s
eyebrows
went
up
as
he
glanced
toward
the
indicated
spot
then
gathered
in
a
frown
not
washed
up
there
surely
he
said
thet
s
what
answered
jarvis
when
sometime
early
this
pshaw
said
the
other
turning
to
look
at
the
curving
bulwark
of
rocks
over
which
the
soft
slow
swell
was
barely
breaking
if
it
were
the
other
end
of
the
cove
now
i
could
understand
yes
agreed
jarvis
they
mostly
come
in
at
the
other
end
on
this
mostly
the
professor
s
tone
was
positive
unless
my
charts
are
wrong
but
it
spoils
at
least
one
phase
of
my
theery
exclaimed
the
liveryman
his
pale
eyes
alight
you
got
a
theery
but
i
thought
you
didn
t
know
anything
about
the
body
till
i
told
you
just
oh
my
ruined
theory
has
reference
to
the
currents
sighed
the
other
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
dead
men
as
neither
has
this
was
the
prompt
response
delivered
with
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
toward
the
dark
object
no
what
is
it
then
if
not
a
dead
man
a
dead
oh
all
the
same
it
shouldn
t
have
come
in
on
this
section
of
the
beach
at
thet
ain
t
half
the
strangeness
of
it
the
way
it
washed
in
lonesome
cove
has
had
some
queer
folks
drift
home
to
it
but
nothing
as
queer
as
this
come
and
see
for
still
frowning
professor
kent
suffered
himself
to
be
led
to
the
spot
two
or
three
of
the
group
as
it
parted
before
him
greeted
him
he
found
himself
looking
down
on
a
corpse
clad
in
a
dark
silk
dress
and
stretched
on
a
wooden
grating
to
which
it
was
lashed
with
a
small
rope
everything
about
the
body
indicated
wealth
the
dress
was
expensively
made
the
shoes
were
of
the
best
type
and
the
stockings
were
silk
the
head
was
marred
by
a
frightful
bruise
which
had
crushed
in
the
right
side
and
extended
around
behind
the
ear
blood
had
clotted
thickly
in
the
short
hair
the
left
side
was
unmarked
the
eyes
were
closed
and
the
mouth
was
slightly
open
showing
a
glint
of
gold
amid
very
white
and
regular
teeth
an
expression
of
deadly
terror
distorted
the
face
professor
kent
bent
closely
over
it
that
s
strange
very
strange
he
murmured
it
should
be
but
look
at
the
hand
cried
jarvis
here
indeed
was
the
astounding
feature
of
the
tragedy
the
aspect
that
brought
kent
to
his
knees
the
more
closely
to
observe
the
body
lay
twisted
slightly
to
the
right
with
the
left
arm
extended
the
left
wrist
was
enclosed
in
a
light
rusted
handcuff
to
which
a
chain
was
fastened
at
the
end
of
the
chain
was
the
companion
cuff
shattered
evidently
by
a
powerful
blow
and
half
buried
in
the
sand
as
kent
leaned
over
the
corpse
a
fat
powerful
grizzled
man
with
a
metal
badge
on
his
pushed
forward
them
s
cuffs
he
announced
that
kind
ain
t
been
used
these
forty
what
kind
of
a
ship
ud
be
carryin
em
nowadays
asked
some
one
in
the
crowd
an
what
kind
of
a
seaman
d
be
putting
of
em
on
a
lady
s
wrists
growled
a
formidable
voice
which
kent
looking
up
perceived
to
have
come
from
amid
a
growth
of
heavy
white
whiskers
sprouting
from
a
face
seafaring
man
aren
t
you
inquired
kent
no
more
fifty
year
of
it
man
an
boy
has
put
me
in
that
s
sailor
smith
explained
jarvis
who
had
assumed
the
duties
of
a
cicerone
not
much
about
the
sea
and
its
ways
good
or
bad
that
he
don
t
true
for
you
confirmed
several
voices
then
smith
will
you
take
a
look
at
those
lashings
and
tell
me
whether
in
your
opinion
they
are
the
work
of
a
sailor
asked
kent
the
old
hands
fumbled
expertly
the
old
face
puckered
judgment
came
forth
presently
the
knots
is
well
enough
the
lashin
s
a
passable
job
what
gits
me
is
the
well
what
s
wrong
with
the
rope
nothin
in
pertic
ler
only
i
don
t
know
what
just
that
style
of
rope
would
be
doin
on
shipboard
unless
it
was
to
hang
the
old
man
s
wash
suppose
we
lift
this
grating
kent
suggested
at
this
the
man
with
the
badge
interposed
say
who
s
runnin
this
thing
anyhow
i
m
sheriff
here
an
this
body
ain
t
to
be
moved
till
a
doctor
has
viewed
of
course
said
kent
mildly
but
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
to
see
sheriff
whether
a
ship
s
name
was
stamped
somewhere
on
this
well
i
don
t
want
any
amachure
learning
me
my
business
declared
the
official
importantly
nevertheless
he
heaved
the
woodwork
up
on
edge
and
held
it
so
while
eager
eyes
scanned
the
under
part
murmurs
of
disappointment
followed
in
these
kent
did
not
join
he
had
inserted
a
finger
in
a
crevice
of
the
splintered
wood
and
had
extracted
some
small
object
which
he
held
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
examining
it
thoughtfully
wot
ye
got
there
demanded
the
sheriff
professor
kent
stretched
out
his
hand
disclosing
a
small
grayish
object
i
should
take
it
to
be
the
cocoon
of
he
announced
an
wot
does
he
do
for
a
livin
inquired
the
official
waxing
humorous
destroys
crops
it
s
a
species
of
oh
grunted
schlager
you
re
a
bug
collector
eh
exactly
answered
the
other
transferring
his
trove
to
his
pocket
thereafter
he
seemed
to
lose
interest
in
the
center
of
mystery
withdrawing
to
some
distance
he
paced
up
and
down
the
shore
whistling
lively
tunes
not
always
in
perfect
accord
from
which
a
deductive
mind
might
have
inferred
that
his
soul
was
not
in
the
music
illustration
we
lift
this
nearer
and
nearer
to
mark
his
pacing
took
him
presently
though
all
the
time
continuing
his
whistling
he
was
scanning
the
tangled
débris
that
the
highest
tide
of
the
year
had
heaped
up
almost
against
the
cliff
s
foot
his
whistling
became
slow
lugubrious
minor
it
sagged
it
died
away
when
it
rose
again
it
was
in
march
time
whereto
the
virtuoso
stepped
briskly
toward
the
crowd
by
this
time
the
group
had
received
several
additions
but
had
suffered
the
loss
of
one
of
its
component
parts
the
sheriff
conjecture
was
buzzing
from
mouth
to
mouth
as
to
the
official
s
sudden
defection
whatever
it
was
he
got
from
the
pocket
kent
heard
one
of
the
men
say
it
started
him
looked
to
me
like
an
envelope
hazarded
some
one
no
contradicted
sailor
smith
paper
would
have
been
all
pulped
up
by
the
marked
handkerchief
maybe
suggested
another
like
as
not
said
jarvis
you
bet
that
len
schlager
figured
it
out
there
was
somethin
in
it
for
him
anyways
i
could
see
the
in
his
that
s
right
too
confirmed
the
old
sailor
he
looked
just
like
that
when
he
brought
in
that
pedler
thinkin
he
was
the
thousan
thief
last
trust
len
schlager
to
look
out
for
number
one
first
an
be
sheriff
afterward
observed
some
one
else
amidst
this
interchange
of
opinion
none
of
which
was
lost
upon
him
professor
kent
advanced
and
bent
over
the
manacled
corpse
have
to
ask
you
to
stand
back
perfessor
said
jarvis
len
s
appointed
me
special
dep
ty
till
he
comes
back
and
he
says
nobody
is
to
lay
finger
on
hide
ner
hair
of
the
corpse
not
even
the
doc
if
he
quite
right
assented
the
other
sheriff
schlager
exhibits
commendable
zeal
and
wonder
if
he
knowed
the
corpse
suggested
somebody
in
the
crowd
tell
you
who
did
if
he
didn
t
said
another
man
who
then
elder
iry
dennett
didn
t
none
of
you
hear
about
his
meetin
up
with
a
strange
woman
yestiddy
evenin
shucks
this
couldn
t
be

woman
said
jarvis
how

come
to
be
washed
ashore
from
a
wreck
between
last
night
and
this
morning
how
d

countered
sailor
smith

a
week
an
this
body

it
plumb
beats

side
just
now
he

up
to
cadystown

the
clock
train
last
then
it
was
early
when
he
met
this
woman
little
after
sundown
he
was
risin
the
hill
beyond
the
s
sedgwick
s
place
the
painter
she
come
out
of
the

quizzed
her
trust
the
elder
for
that
but
he
didn
t
get
much
out
of
her
until
he
mentioned
the
nook
then
she
allowed
she
guessed
she
d
go
there
an
he
watched
her
you
say
a
man
named
sedgwick
lives
at
the
nook

that
francis
sedgwick
the
artist
asked
kent
that

there
all
alone
with
a
chinese
well
the
lady
went
down
the
hill
continued
jarvis
just
as
sedgwick
come
out
to
smoke
a
pipe
on
his
stone
wall
iry
thought
he
seemed
su
prised
when
she
bespoke
him
they
passed
a
few
remarks
an
then
they
had
some
words
an
the
lady
laughed
loud
an
kinder
scornful
he
seemed
to
be
pointin
at
a
necklace
of
queer
fiery
pink
stones
thet
she
wore
and
tryin
to
get
somethin
out
of
her
she
turned
away
an
he
started
to
follow
when
all
of
a
sudden
she
grabbed
up
a
rock
an
let
him
have
keeled
him
clean
over
then
she
ran
away
up
the
road
toward
hawkill
cliffs
that
s
the
way
iry
dennett
tells
it
but
i
ain
t
never
heard
of
a
story
losin
anythin
in
the
tellin
when
it
come
through
iry
s
well
this
corpse
ain
t
got
no
pink
necklace
suggested
somebody
bodies
sometimes
gets
robbed
said
sailor
smith
chester
kent
stooped
over
the
writhen
face
again
peering
close
then
he
straightened
up
and
began
pulling
thoughtfully
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
he
pulled
and
pulled
until
as
if
by
that
process
he
had
turned
his
face
toward
the
cliff
his
lips
pursed
he
began
whistling
softly
and
tunelessly
his
gaze
was
abstracted
ain
t
seen
nothin
to
make
you
feel
bad
have
you
perfessor
inquired
jarvis
with
some
acerbity
eh
what
said
kent
absently
seen
anything
nothing
but
what
s
there
for
any
one
to
following
his
fixed
gaze
the
others
studied
the
face
of
the
cliff
all
but
sailor
smith
he
blinked
at
the
corpse
say
said
he
presently
what
s
them
queer
little
marks
on
the
neck
under
the
ear
back
came
kent
s
eyes
those
he
said
smiling
why
those
are
one
might
suppose
such
indentations
as
would
be
made
in
flesh
by
forcing
a
jewel
setting
violently
against
it
by
a
blow
or
strong
then
you
think
it
was
the
began
the
old
seaman
when
several
voices
broke
in
there
goes
len
now
the
sheriff
s
heavy
figure
appeared
on
the
brow
of
the
cliff
moving
toward
the
village
who

him
inquired
kent

he
looked
seaward
where
the

were
now
baring
their
teeth
more
plainly
through
the
racing
currents
and
he
sighed
that
sigh
meant

effect
i
wanted
to
play
with
my
tides
and
eddies
and
here
is
work
thrown
at

then

well
i

there
was
some
feeling
against

who
refused
to
make
the
vote

no

he
persisted
sturdily
that

of
talkin

as
len
possibly
the
one
supporter
of
the
absent
would
have
wavered
in
his
loyalty
had
he
seen
the
trove
that
professor
chester
kent
had
carried
unostentatiously
from
the
beach
in
his
pocket
after
picking
it
from
the
grating
it
was
the
fuzzy
cocoon
of
a
small
and
quite
unimportant
insect
perhaps
the
admiring
smith
might
even
have
come
around
to
the
majority
opinion
regarding
professor
kent
s
intellectual
futility
could
he
have
observed
the
absorbed
interest
with
which
the
washington
scientist
seated
on
a
boulder
opened
up
the
cocoon
pricked
it
until
the
impotent
inmate
wriggled
in
protest
and
then
casting
it
aside
to
perish
threw
himself
on
his
back
and
whistled
the
whole
of

s
mostly
off
the

chapter
kent
makes
a
call
between
the
roadway
and
the
broad
front
lawn
of
the
nook
a
rough
stone
wall
interposes
looking
up
from
his
painting
francis
sedgwick
beheld
in
the
glare
of
the
afternoon
sun
a
spare
figure
rise
alertly
upon
the
wall
descend
to
the
road
and
rise
again
he
stepped
to
the
open
window
and
watched
a
curious
progress
a
man
clad
in
serviceable
khaki
was
performing
a
stunt
with
the
wall
as
a
basis
he
was
walking
from
east
to
west
quite
fast
and
every
third
pace
stepping
upon
the
wall
stepping
sedgwick
duly
noted
not
jumping
the
change
of
level
being
made
without
visible
effort
now
sedgwick
himself
was
distinctly
long
of
leg
and
limber
but
he
realized
that
he
would
be
wholly
incapable
of
duplicating
the
stranger
s
gracefully
accomplished
feat
without
violent
and
clumsy
exertion
consequently
he
was
interested
leaning
out
of
the
window
he
called
hello
there
good
afternoon
said
the
stranger
in
a
quiet
cultivated
voice
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
are
doing
on
my
not
in
the
least
replied
the
bearded
man
rising
buoyantly
into
full
view
and
subsiding
again
with
the
rhythm
of
a
wave
well
what
you
doing
taking
a
little
by
this
time
having
reached
the
end
of
the
wall
he
turned
and
came
back
making
the
step
with
his
right
leg
instead
of
his
left
sedgwick
hurried
and
out
into
the
roadway
the
stranger
continued
his
performance
silently
at
closer
inspection
it
appealed
to
the
artist
as
even
more
mysterious
both
in
purport
and
execution
than
it
had
looked
at
a
distance
do
you
do
that
often
he
asked
presently
the
gymnast
paused
poised
like
a
mercury
on
the
high
coping
yes
said
he
otherwise
i
shouldn
t
be
able
to
do
it
at
i
should
think
not
indeed
has
it
any
particular
utility
that
form
of
exercise
certainly
it
is
in
pursuance
of
a
theory
of
what
in
the
world
has
to
do
with
i
shall
expound
said
the
stranger
in
professional
tones
taking
a
seat
by
the
unusual
method
of
letting
himself
down
on
one
leg
while
holding
the
other
at
right
angles
to
his
body
do
you
know
anything
of
very
in
common
with
most
americans
for
that
reason
alone
the
japanese
system
is
highly
effective
here
not
so
effective
in
japan
you
perceive
there
the
basis
of
my
no
i
don
t
perceive
it
at
a
system
of
defense
is
effective
in
proportion
to
its
unfamiliarity
that
is
then
your
system
consists
in
stepping
up
on
a
wall
and
diving
into
obscurity
on
the
farther
side
perhaps
suggested
sedgwick
ironically
defense
i
said
not
escape
escape
is
perhaps
preferable
to
defense
but
not
always
so
practicable
no
the
wall
merely
served
as
a
temporary
gymnasium
while
i
was
waiting
for
what
for
you
have
distinctly
the
advantage
of
me
said
sedgwick
with
a
frown
for
he
was
in
no
mood
to
welcome
strange
visitors
to
return
to
my
theory
of
said
the
other
imperturbably
my
wall
exercise
serves
to
keep
limber
and
active
certain
muscles
that
in
the
average
man
are
half
atrophied
you
are
familiar
with
the
ostrich
with
his
proverbial
methods
of
obfuscation
replied
sedgwick
the
other
smiled
that
again
is
escape
or
attempted
escape
my
reference
was
to
other
characteristics
however
i
shall
he
rose
on
one
foot
with
an
ease
that
made
the
artist
stare
descended
selected
from
the
roadway
a
stone
of
ordinary
cobble
size
and
handed
it
to
sedgwick
let
that
lie
on
the
palm
of
your
hand
said
he
and
hold
it
out
waist
as
he
spoke
he
was
standing
two
feet
from
the
other
to
his
right
sedgwick
did
as
he
was
requested
as
his
hand
took
position
there
was
a
twist
of
the
bearded
man
s
lithe
body
a
sharp
click
and
the
stone
flying
in
a
rising
curve
swished
through
the
leafage
of
a
lilac
fifty
feet
away
how
did
you
do
that
cried
the
artist
the
other
showed
a
slight
indentation
on
the
inside
of
his
right
boot
heel
and
then
swung
his
right
foot
slowly
and
steadily
up
behind
his
left
knee
and
let
it
lapse
into
position
again
at
shoulder
height
he
explained
i
could
have
done
the
same
but
it
would
have
broken
your

see
said
the
other
adding
with
distaste

to
kick
an
opponent
why
even
as
a
boy
i
was

were
not
speaking
of

said
the
visitor
coolly
nor
am
i
concerned
with
the
rules
of
the
as
applied
to
my
theory
when
one
is
in
danger
one
uses
knife
or
gun
if
at
hand
i
prefer
a
less
deadly
and
more
effective
weapon
kicking
sidewise
either
to
the
front
or
to
the
rear
i
can
disarm
a
man

his
leg
or
lay
him

it
is
the
special
development
of
such
muscles
as
the
sartorius
and
plantaris
he
ran
his
long
fingers
down
from
the
outside
of
his
thigh
round
to
the
inside
of
his
ankle

enables
a

easy
familiarity

never
wholly
lost
to
those
who
have
been
close
friends
in

days
presently
francis
sedgwick
was
telling
his
friend
the
story
of
his
feverish
and
thwarted
ten
years
in
the
world
within
a
year
of
his
graduation
his
only
surviving
relative
had
died
willing
to
him
a
considerable
fortune
the
income
of
which
he
used
in
furtherance
of
a
hitherto
suppressed
ambition
to
study
art
paris
his
mecca
was
first
a
then
a
temptress
finally
a
vampire
before
succumbing
he
had
gone
far
in
a
few
years
toward
the
development
of
a
curious
technique
of
his
own
followed
then
two
years
of
dissipation
a
year
of
travel
to
recuperate
and
the
return
to
paris
which
was
to
be
once
more
the
but
to
his
terror
and
he
found
the
power
of
application
gone
the
muscles
of
his
mind
had
become
flabby
he
quoted
to
kent
with
bitterness
the
terrible
final
lines
of
rossetti
s
in
when
work
and
will
awake
too
late
to
gaze
after
their
life
sailed
by
and
hold
their
breath
ah
who
shall
dare
to
search
through
what
sad
maze
thenceforth
their
incommunicable
ways
follow
the
desultory
feet
of
death
when
work

will
awake
too
late
repeated
kent
but
is
it
too
late
in
your
case
surely
not
since
you
re
here
and
at
your

think
of
the
waste
man
yet
here
i
am
as
you
say
and
still
able
to
fight
all
by
virtue
of
a

the
laugh
of

without

was
at
the

hall
on
the
slope
of

was
one
of
the
dancers
the
wreck
of
what
had
once
been
beauty
and
one
must
suppose
innocence
probably
she
thought
me
too
much
to
hear
or
understand
as
i
sat
half
asleep
at

she
answered
her

occurs
to
me
an
article
in
a
french
journal
about
a
wonderful
new
american
expert
in
criminology
who
knows
all
there
is
to
know
and
takes
only
the
most
abstruse
cases
i
recall
now
that
the
article
called
him
le

that
would
be
about
as
near
as
they
would
come
to
your

a
good
deal
nearer
than
that
infernal
french
journalist
whom

to

at

got
to
the

stated

you

made
you

superior
species
of
highfalutin
detective
working

peculiarly
your

interjected

the
only

a

can
work
along
successfully
are
the
lines
laid
down
for

by

sounds
more
reasonable
than
romantic
admitted
the
artist
come
now
kent
open
up
and
tell
me
something
about
only
last
month
a
magazine
put
that
request
in
writing
and
accompanied
it
with
an
offer
of
hundred
i
didn
t
accept
however
as
i
may
wish
to
ask
you
a
number
of
leading
questions
later
i
ll
answer
yours
now
you
remember
i
got
into
trouble
my
senior
year
with
the
college
authorities
by
proving
the
typhoid
epidemic
direct
against
a
forgotten
defect
in
the
sewer
system
it
nearly
cost
me
my
diploma
but
it
helped
me
too
later
for
a
scientist
in
the
department
of
agriculture
at
washington
learned
of
it
and
sent
for
me
after
graduation
he
talked
to
me
about
the
work
that
a
man
with
the
true
investigation
he
thought
i
do
by
employing
his
abilities
along
strictly
scientific
lines
and
he
mapped
out
for
me
a
s
postgraduate
course
which
i
had
just
about
enough
money
to
take
while
i
specialized
on
botany
entomology
and
bacteriology
i
picked
up
a
working
knowledge
of
other
branches
chemistry
toxicology
geology
mineralogy
physiology
and
most
of
the
natural
sciences
having
been
blessed
with
an
eager
and
catholic
curiosity
about
the
world
we
live
in
once
in
the
department
i
found
myself
with
a
sort
of
roving
commission
i
worked
under
such
men
as
wiley
howard
and
merriam
and
learned
from
them
something
of
the
infinite
and
scrupulous
patience
that
truly
original
scientific
achievement
demands
at
first
my
duties
were
largely
those
of
minor
research
then
by
accident
largely
i
chanced
upon
the
plot
to
bull
the
cotton
market
by
introducing
the
boll
weevil
into
the
uninfested
cotton
area
and
checked
that
soon
afterward
i
was
put
on
the
deodorized
meat
enterprise
and
succeeded
in
discovering
the
scheme
whereby
it
was
hoped
to
sell
spoiled
meat
for
good
you
might
have
heard
of
those
cases
but
you
would
hardly
have
learned
of
the
success
in
which
i
really
take
a
pride
the
cultivation
of
a
running
wild
grape
to
destroy
the
common
poison
ivy
what
spare
time
i
had
i
devoted
to
experimenting
along
mechanical
lines
and
patented
an
invention
that
has
been
profitable
some
time
ago
the
department
of
justice
borrowed
me
on
a
few
cases
with
a
scientific
bearing
and
more
recently
offered
me
incidental
work
with
them
on
such
favorable
terms
that
i
resigned
my
other
position
the
terms
include
liberal
vacations
one
of
which
i
am
now
taking
and
here
i
am
is
that
sufficient
hardly
all
this
suggests
the
arts
of
peace
what
about
your
kick
you
don
t
practise
that
for
exhibitions
i
take
it
sometimes
confessed
the
scientist
i
have
found
myself
at
close
quarters
with
persons
of
dubious
character
the
fact
is
that
an
ingenious
plot
to
get
rid
of
a
very
old
friend
doctor
lucius
carter
the
botanist
drew
me
into
the
criminal
line
and
since
then
that
phase
of
investigation
has
seemed
fairly
to
obtrude
itself
on
me
officially
and
unofficially
even
up
here
where
i
hoped
to
enjoy
a
month
s
you
know
he
said
breaking
off
that
you
have
a
most
interesting
inset
of
ocean
currents
hereabouts
of
course
lonesome
cove
but
kindly
finish
that
even
up
here
i
recollect
your
saying
that
you
were
waiting
for
me
haven
t
traced
any
scientific
crime
to
my
door
have
you
let
me
forget
my
work
for
a
little
while
pleaded
his
visitor
and
look
at
sedgwick
rose
come
he
said
and
led
the
way
to
the
big
bare
bright
studio
from
the
threshold
chester
kent
delivered
an
opinion
after
one
approving
survey
you
really
work
i
i
really
do
where
do
you
see
it
though
all
over
the
place
no
draperies
or
fripperies
or
fopperies
of
art
here
the
barer
the
room
the
more
work
done
in
he
walked
over
to
a
curious
contrivance
resembling
a
small
examined
it
surveyed
the
empty
easel
against
which
were
leaning
face
in
a
number
of
pictures
all
of
a
size
and
turned
half
a
dozen
of
them
over
ranging
them
and
stepping
back
for
examination
standing
before
them
he
whistled
a
long
passage
from
and
had
started
to
rewhistle
it
in
another
key
when
the
artist
broke
in
with
some
impatience
well
good
work
pronounced
kent
quietly
and
in
some
subtle
way
the
commonplace
words
conveyed
to
their
hearer
the
fact
that
the
man
who
spoke
them
knew
it
s
the
best
there
is
in
me
at
least
said
sedgwick
kent
went
slowly
around
the
walls
keenly
examining
silently
appraising
there
were
landscapes
genre
bits
studies
of
the
ocean
in
its
various
moods
flashes
of
pagan
imaginings
nature
studies
a
wonderful
picture
of
wild
geese
settling
from
a
flight
a
no
less
striking
sketch
of
a
mink
startled
as
he
crept
to
drink
among
the
sedges
a
group
of
country
children
at
on
the
sands
all
the
varied
subjects
handled
with
a
deftness
of
truth
and
drawing
and
colored
with
a
clear
softness
quite
individual
have
you
found
or
founded
a
new
system
of
coloring
asked
kent
as
he
moved
among
the
little
masterpieces
no
don
t
tell
he
touched
one
of
the
surfaces
delicately
it
s
not
paint
and
it
s
not
pastel
oh
i
see
they
re
all
of
one
he
glanced
at
the
heavy
mechanism
near
the
easel
they
re
color
sedgwick
nodded
monotypes
said
he
i
paint
on
copper
make
one
impress
and
sponge
across
the
copper
makes
each
one
an
you
certainly
obtain
your
the
printing
seems
to
refine
the
color
for
instance
moonlight
on
white
water
a
thing
i
ve
never
been
able
to
approach
either
in
straight
oils
or
water
see
from
behind
a
cloth
he
drew
a
square
and
set
it
on
the
easel
kent
whistled
again
casual
fragments
of
light
and
heavy
opera
intermingled
with
considerative
twitches
of
his
ear
it
s
the
first
one
i
ve
given
a
name
to
said
sedgwick
i
call
it
rough
a
full
moon
brilliant
amid
blown
lighted
up
the
vast
procession
of
billows
charging
in
upon
a
near
coast
in
the
foreground
a
corpse
the
face
bent
far
up
and
back
from
the
spar
to
which
it
was
lashed
rode
with
wild
abandon
headlong
at
the
onlooker
on
the
crest
of
a
roaring
surge
the
rest
was
infinite
clarity
of
distance
and
desolation
rough
rider
murmured
kent
then
with
a
change
of
tone
for
sale
i
don
t
know
hesitated
the
artist
fact
is
i
like
that
about
well
enough
to
i
ll
give
you
five
hundred
dollars
for
five
hundred
man
alive
a
hundred
is
the
most
i
ve
ever
got
for
any
of
my
prints
the
offer
but
see
here
kent
can
you
afford
it
government
salaries
don
t
make
men
rich
do
they
oh
i
m
rich
enough
said
the
other
impatiently
i
told
you
i
d
made
inventions
and
i
can
certainly
afford
to
buy
it
better
than
you
can
afford
to
keep
it
what
s
that
asked
the
painter
surprised
kent
repeated
his
final
sentence
with
slow
emphasis
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
he
asked
looking
flatly
into
sedgwick
s
eyes
no
not
in
the
least
another
suggestion
of
mystery
do
you
always
deal
in
this
sort
of
thing
very
seldom
however
if
you
don
t
understand
so
much
the
better
when
did
you
finish
this
picture
has
any
one
else
seen
it
that
old
fraud
of
a
plumber
elder
dennett
saw
me
working
on
it
yesterday
when
he
was
doing
some
repairing
here
and
remarked
that
it
gave
him
the
dennett
well
then
that
s
all
up
said
kent
as
if
speaking
to
himself
there
s
a
streak
of
superstition
in
all
these
new
englanders
he
d
be
sure
to
interpret
it
as
a
confession
before
the
fact
however
elder
dennett
left
this
morning
for
a
trip
to
cadystown
that
s
so
much
to
the
he
may
have
left
for
a
trip
to
hadestown
for
all
i
care
stated
sedgwick
with
conviction
what
s
it
all
about
anyway
i
ll
tell
you
as
soon
as
i
ve
mulled
it
over
a
little
just
let
me
cool
my
mind
down
with
some
more
of
your
he
turned
to
the
wall
border
again
and
faced
another
picture
out
what
s
this
you
seem
to
be
something
of
a
dab
in
black
and
white
oh
that
s
an
imaginary
face
said
sedgwick
carelessly
imaginary
face
studied
from
various
angles
commented
kent
it
s
a
very
lovely
face
and
the
most
wistful
i
ve
ever
seen
a
fairy
prisoned
on
earth
by
cockcrow
might
wear
some
such
expression
of
startled
wondering
purity
i
poetry
as
well
as
mystery
kent
you
grow
and
expand
on
there
is
poetry
in
your
study
of
that
imaginary
fay
imaginary
continued
kent
dryly
as
he
stooped
to
the
floor
i
suppose
this
is
an
imaginary
hairpin
my
began
sedgwick
quickly
when
the
other
caught
him
up
don
t
be
uneasy
i
m
not
going
to
commit
the
of
asking
who
she
if
you
did
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
couldn
t
tell
you
i
only
wish
i
knew
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
moment
then
the
painter
broke
out
with
the
air
of
one
who
takes
a
resolution
see
here
kent
you
re
a
sort
of
detective
aren
t
you
i
ve
been
called
and
you
like
my
picture
of
rough
five
hundred
dollars
you
can
have
that
and
any
other
picture
in
my
studio
except
this
one
he
indicated
the
canvas
with
the
faces
if
you
ll
find
out
for
me
who
she
that
might
be
done
we
shall
see
but
frankly
sedgwick
there
s
a
matter
of
more
importance
good
heavens
man
there
s
nothing
so
important
in
this
world
oh
is
it
as
bad
as
that
a
heavy
knock
sounded
from
below
followed
by
the
chinaman
s
voice
intermingled
with
boyish
accents
demanding
sedgwick
in
the
name
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
send
him
up
ordered
sedgwick
and
the
boy
arrived
but
not
before
kent
had
quietly
removed
rough
from
its
place
of
exhibit
special
from
the
village
announced
young
mercury
sign
after
the
signature
had
been
duly
set
down
and
the
signer
had
read
his
message
with
knit
brows
the
urchin
lingered
big
with
news
say
heard
about
the
body
on
the
beach
kent
turned
quickly
to
see
sedgwick
s
face
it
was
interested
but
unmoved
as
he
replied
no
where
was
it
found
lonesome
cove
woman
dressed
swell
washed
up
on
a
grating
last
night
or
this
it
s
curious
how
they
all
come
in
here
isn
t
it
said
the
artist
to
kent
this
is
the
third
this
and
it
s
a
corkerino
said
the
boy
sheriff
s
on
the
case
body
was
all
chained
up
they
i
m
sure
they
need
you
at
the
office
to
help
circulate
the
news
my
son
said
kent
and
i
ll
bet
you
this
quarter
payable
in
advance
that
you
can
t
get
back
in
half
an
hour
on
your
with
a
grin
the
boy
took
the
coin
i
got
yer
he
said
and
was
off
and
now
sedgwick
said
kent
decisively
if
i
m
to
help
you
suppose
you
tell
me
all
that
you
know
about
the
woman
who
called
on
you
last
evening
last
evening
ah
that
wasn
t
the
girl
of
the
picture
it
s
an
interminable
six
days
since
i
ve
seen
no
i
know
it
wasn
t
she
having
seen
your
picture
and
since
then
your
visitor
of
last
night
the
question
is
who
was
it
wait
how
did
you
know
that
a
woman
came
here
last
night
from
common
and
where
have
you
seen
her
since
on
the
beach
at
lonesome
lonesome
cove
repeated
sedgwick
mechanically
then
with
a
startled
glance
not
the
dead
woman
kent
nodded
watching
him
closely
for
a
space
of
four
very
slow
and
three
very
was
silence
between
them
kent
broke
it
do
you
see
now
the
wisdom
of
frankness
you
mean
that
i
shall
be
accused
of
having
a
hand
in
her
death
strongly
suspected
at
on
what
basis
you
are
the
last
person
known
to
have
seen
her
surely
that
isn
t
enough
not
of
itself
there
s
a
bruise
back
of
your
right
involuntarily
sedgwick
s
hand
went
to
the
spot
who
gave
it
to
you
pursued
kent
you
know
it
all
without
my
telling
you
cried
sedgwick
but
i
never
saw
the
woman
before
in
my
life
give
you
my
word
of
honor
she
came
and
went
but
who
she
is
or
why
she
came
or
where
she
went
i
have
no
more
idea
than
you
have
perhaps
not
nearly
so
there
you
are
wrong
i
m
depending
on
you
to
tell
me
about
not
if
my
life
hung
on
it
and
how
could
her
being
found
drowned
on
the
beach
be
connected
with
me
i
didn
t
say
that
she
was
found
drowned
on
the
you
did
no
pardon
me
it
was
the
messenger
boy
but
you
said
that
her
body
was
found
in
lonesome
that
is
quite
a
different
she
wasn
t
drowned
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
if
the
autopsy
showed
any
water
in
the
but
the
boy
said
that
the
body
was
lashed
to
a
grating
and
that
there
were
chains
on
it
is
that
true
it
was
lashed
to
a
grating
and
manacled
what
a
ghastly
mystery
sedgwick
dropped
his
chin
in
meditation
if
she
wasn
t
drowned
then
she
was
murdered
and
thrown
overboard
from
a
boat
is
that
it
chester
kent
smiled
inscrutably
suppose
you
let
me
do
the
questioning
a
while
you
can
give
no
clue
whatsoever
to
the
identity
of
your
yesterday
s
visitor
there
was
the
slightest
possible
hesitation
before
the
artist
replied
none
at
if
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
what
will
the
villagers
think
of
it
when
elder
dennett
returns
from
cadystown
and
tells
his
story
as
he
is
sure
to
do
does
dennett
know
the
woman
no
but
it
isn
t
his
fault
that
he
doesn
t
he
did
his
best
in
the
interviewing
line
when
he
met
her
on
her
way
to
your
she
wasn
t
on
her
way
to
my
place
objected
sedgwick
dennett
got
the
notion
that
she
was
accordingly
with
the
true
delicacy
of
our
fine
old
new
england
stock
he
hid
behind
a
bush
and
did
he
overhear
our
conversation
he
was
too
far
away
he
saw
the
attack
on
you
now
just
fit
together
these
significant
bits
of
fact
the
body
of
a
woman
dead
by
violence
is
found
on
the
beach
not
far
from
here
the
last
person
as
far
as
is
known
to
have
seen
her
alive
is
yourself
she
called
on
you
and
there
was
a
colloquy
apparently
vehement
between
you
culminating
in
the
assault
upon
you
she
hurried
away
one
might
well
guess
that
later
you
followed
her
to
her
i
did
follow
her
said
sedgwick
in
a
low
tone
for
what
purpose
to
find
out
who
she
which
you
didn
t
succeed
in
doing
she
was
too
quick
for
me
the
blow
of
the
rock
had
made
me
giddy
and
she
got
away
among
the
that
s
a
pity
one
more
point
of
suspicion
dennett
you
say
saw
your
picture
rough
he
will
tell
every
one
about
it
you
may
be
what
of
it
the
strange
coincidence
of
the
subject
and
the
apparent
manner
of
the
unknown
s
people
will
hardly
suspect
that
i
killed
her
and
set
her
adrift
for
a
model
i
suppose
said
the
artist
bitterly
particularly
as
dennett
can
tell
them
that
the
picture
was
finished
before
her
not
that
but
there
will
be
plenty
of
among
the
yankee
populace
ready
to
believe
that
a
fiend
inspired
both
picture
and
murder
in
your
mind
why
the
very
fact
of
your
being
an
artist
would
be
evidence
of
a
compact
with
the
devil
to
some
people
and
you
must
admit
a
certain
diabolical
ghastliness
in
that
evidently
some
devil
of
ill
fate
is
mixing
up
in
my
affairs
what
s
your
advice
in
the
matter
tell
me
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
suggested
chester
kent
easily
done
the
question
is
whether
you
ll
believe
if
i
hadn
t
felt
pretty
sure
of
your
innocence
i
shouldn
t
have
opened
the
case
to
you
as
i
ve
done
i
ll
believe
the
truth
if
you
tell
it
and
tell
it
very
well
i
was
sitting
on
my
wall
when
the
woman
came
down
the
road
i
noticed
her
first
when
she
stopped
to
look
back
and
her
absurd
elegance
of
dress
expensive
and
ill
fitting
attracted
my
closer
attention
she
was
carrying
a
bundle
wrapped
in
strong
paper
it
seemed
to
be
heavy
for
she
shifted
it
from
hand
to
hand
when
she
came
near
i
spoke
to
you
spoke
to
her
first
well
we
spoke
why
should
you
speak
to
her
if
she
was
a
stranger
to
you
see
here
kent
you
ll
have
to
let
me
tell
this
in
my
own
way
if
i
m
to
tell
it
at
so
long
as
you
do
tell
it
what
did
she
say
to
you
she
asked
me
the
casually
not
as
if
she
were
making
it
a
pretext
to
open
a
conversation
if
that
is
what
you
it
certainly
it
wasn
t
that
she
seemed
anxious
to
know
in
fact
i
think
she
used
the
word
exact
the
exact
time
she
presumably
she
was
on
her
way
to
an
appointment
very
likely
when
i
told
her
she
seemed
relieved
i
might
even
say
relaxed
as
if
from
the
strain
of
nervous
haste
you
good
and
then
she
thanked
me
and
asked
if
i
were
sedgwick
i
answered
that
i
was
and
suggested
that
she
make
good
by
completing
the
she
wasn
t
a
woman
of
your
own
class
then
sedgwick
looked
puzzled
well
no
i
thought
not
then
or
i
shouldn
t
have
been
so
free
and
easy
with
her
for
one
thing
she
was
painted
badly
and
the
perspiration
running
down
her
forehead
had
made
her
a
sight
yet
i
don
t
know
her
voice
was
that
of
a
cultivated
person
her
manner
was
awkward
and
her
dress
weird
for
that
time
of
day
and
for
all
that
she
carried
herself
like
a
person
accustomed
to
some
degree
of
consideration
that
i
felt
quite
plainly
i
felt
too
something
uncanny
about
her
her
eyes
alone
would
have
produced
that
impression
they
were
peculiarly
restless
and
insane
questioned
kent
not
wholly
sane
certainly
but
it
might
have
been
drugs
that
suggested
itself
to
a
possibility
she
asked
what
point
of
the
headland
gave
the
best
view
anywhere
from
the
first
rise
on
is
good
i
said
it
depends
on
what
you
wish
to
my
ship
coming
said
it
will
be
a
far
view
then
i
told
her
this
is
a
coast
of
guardian
what
difference
she
said
and
then
gave
me
another
surprise
for
she
quoted
and
though
thy
soul
sail
leagues
and
leagues
still
leagues
beyond
those
leagues
there
is
more
that
s
interesting
remarked
kent
casual
female
wayfarers
aren
t
given
to
quoting
house
of
nor
casual
ships
to
visiting
this
part
of
the
coast
however
there
was
no
ship
i
looked
for
myself
when
i
was
trying
to
find
the
woman
later
what
are
you
smiling
at
nothing
i
m
sorry
i
she
walked
away
from
me
a
few
paces
but
turned
and
came
back
at
once
i
follow
my
star
she
said
pointing
to
a
planet
that
shone
low
over
the
sea
therein
lies
the
only
true
happiness
to
dare
and
to
it
s
a
practise
which
has
got
many
people
into
trouble
and
some
into
jail
i
remarked
do
not
be
flippant
she
replied
in
her
deep
tones
perhaps
under
that
star
you
move
on
dim
paths
to
an
unknown
see
here
i
broke
out
you
re
making
me
uncomfortable
if
you
ve
got
something
to
tell
please
tell
it
kindly
omitting
the
remember
this
meeting
she
said
in
a
tone
of
solemn
command
for
it
may
mark
an
epoch
in
your
life
some
day
in
the
future
i
may
send
for
you
and
recall
to
your
mind
by
what
i
have
just
said
in
that
day
you
will
know
the
hidden
things
that
are
clear
only
to
the
chosen
minds
perhaps
you
will
be
the
last
person
but
one
to
see
me
as
i
now
kent
pulled
nervously
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
is
it
possible
that
she
foresaw
her
death
he
murmured
it
would
look
so
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened
wouldn
t
it
yet
there
was
an
uncanny
air
of
joyousness
about
her
i
don
t
like
it
announced
kent
i
not
like
it
by
which
he
meant
that
he
did
not
understand
it
what
chester
kent
does
not
understand
chester
kent
resents
perhaps
suggested
the
artist
a
woman
in
love
will
take
any
risk
of
death
however
he
added
rubbing
his
bruised
head
reminiscently
she
had
a
very
practical
bent
for
a
romantic
person
after
her
mysterious
prophecy
she
started
on
i
called
to
her
to
come
back
or
i
would
follow
and
make
her
explain
as
to
what
everything
her
being
there
her
actions
apparel
the
jewelry
you
know
and
all
you
ve
said
nothing
about
haven
t
i
well
when
she
just
a
moment
was
it
the
jewelry
that
you
were
going
to
speak
of
when
you
first
accosted
her
yes
it
was
some
of
it
was
very
valuable
i
judge
wasn
t
it
found
on
the
body
not
robbery
then
probably
well
she
came
back
at
a
stride
her
eyes
were
alive
with
anger
there
came
a
torrent
of
words
from
her
strong
words
too
nothing
of
the
woman
left
there
i
insisted
on
knowing
who
she
was
and
she
burst
out
on
me
with
laughter
that
was
somehow
more
insulting
than
her
speech
but
when
i
told
her
that
i
d
find
out
about
her
if
i
had
to
follow
her
into
the
sea
she
stopped
laughing
fast
enough
before
i
could
guard
myself
she
had
caught
up
a
rock
from
the
road
and
let
me
have
it
i
went
over
like
a
tenpin
when
i
got
up
she
was
well
along
toward
the
cliffs
and
i
never
did
find
her
trail
in
that
maze
of
copses
and
show
me
your
relative
positions
when
she
attacked
the
artist
placed
kent
and
moved
off
five
paces
about
like
that
he
said
did
she
throw
overhand
or
underhand
it
was
so
quick
i
hardly
know
but
i
should
say
a
short
overhand
snap
it
came
hard
enough
i
do
not
like
it
at
all
said
kent
again
he
wandered
disconsolately
and
with
eyes
about
the
room
until
he
blundered
into
collision
with
a
in
the
corner
spread
with
cushions
these
he
heaped
up
threw
his
coat
over
them
stretched
himself
out
with
his
feet
propped
high
on
the
mound
just
erected
and
closed
his
eyes
sleepy
inquired
sedgwick
busy
retorted
his
guest
like
some
more
pillows
no
i
d
like
ten
minutes
of
the
speaker
opened
one
eye
at
the
end
of
that
time
perhaps
you
ll
think
better
of
of
what
of
concealing
an
essentially
important
part
of
your
experience
which
has
to
do
i
think
with
the
at
the
end
of
the
ten
minutes
when
kent
opened
both
eyes
his
friend
forestalled
him
with
another
query
you
say
that
no
jewels
were
found
on
the
body
was
there
any
other
mark
of
identification
if
there
was
the
sheriff
got
away
with
it
before
i
saw
how
can
you
be
sure
then
that
the
dead
woman
was
my
visitor
dennett
mentioned
a
necklace
on
the
crushed
flesh
of
the
dead
woman
s
neck
there
is
the
plain
impress
of
a
jewel
setting
now
come
sedgwick
if
i
m
to
help
you
in
this
you
must
help
me
had
you
ever
seen
that
necklace
before
yes
was
the
reply
given
with
obvious
reluctance
where
on
the
neck
of
the
girl
of
my
kent
s
fingers
went
to
his
ear
pulling
at
the
lobe
until
that
unoffending
pendant
stretched
like
rubber
you
re
sure
he
asked
there
couldn
t
be
any
mistake
the
stones
were
matched
you
mightn
t
find
another
like
it
in
the
whole
kent
whistled
soft
and
long
i
m
afraid
my
boy
he
said
at
length
i
m
very
much
afraid
that
you
ll
have
to
tell
me
the
whole
story
of
the
romance
of
the
pictured
face
and
this
time
without
that
s
what
i
ve
been
guarding
against
retorted
the
other
it
isn
t
a
thing
that
i
can
tell
man
to
man
don
t
you
understand
or
he
added
savagely
do
you
misunderstand
no
i
don
t
misunderstand
answered
kent
very
gently
i
know
there
are
things
that
can
t
be
spoken
not
because
they
are
shameful
but
because
they
are
sacred
yet
i
ve
got
to
know
about
her
here
i
have
it
when
i
m
gone
sit
down
and
write
it
out
for
me
simply
and
fully
and
send
it
to
my
hotel
as
soon
as
it
is
done
you
can
do
that
can
t
you
yes
i
can
do
that
decided
sedgwick
after
some
consideration
good
then
give
me
some
dinner
and
let
s
forget
this
grisly
thing
for
a
time
and
talk
of
the
old
days
whatever
became
of
harkness
of
our
class
do
you
know
between
them
that
evening
was
no
further
mention
of
the
strange
body
in
lonesome
cove
chapter
lady
of
mystery
a
single
autobiographical
chapter
from
the
life
of
francis
sedgwick
with
editorial
comment
by
professor
chester
dear
kent
here
goes
i
met
her
first
on
june
at
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
some
wonderful
cloud
effects
after
a
hard
rain
had
brought
me
out
into
the
open
i
had
pitched
my
easel
in
the
hollow
on
the
martindale
road
so
as
to
get
that
clump
of
pine
against
the
sky
there
i
sat
working
away
with
a
will
when
i
heard
the
drumming
of
hoofs
and
a
horse
with
a
girl
in
the
saddle
came
whizzing
round
the
turn
almost
upon
me
just
there
the
rain
had
made
a
puddle
of
thick
sticky
mud
the
variety
as
the
horse
went
by
at
full
gallop
a
fine
fat
mud
pie
rose
soared
through
the
air
and
landed
in
the
middle
of
my
painting
i
fairly
yelped
to
get
it
all
off
was
hopeless
however
i
went
at
it
and
was
cursing
over
the
job
when
i
heard
the
hoofs
coming
back
and
the
rider
pulled
up
close
to
me
i
heard
you
cry
out
said
a
voice
very
full
and
low
did
i
hurt
you
i
hope
no
i
said
without
looking
up
small
thanks
to
you
that
you
didn
t
my
tone
silenced
her
for
a
moment
somehow
though
i
got
the
feeling
that
she
was
amused
more
than
abashed
at
my
resentment
and
her
voice
was
suspiciously
meek
when
she
presently
spoke
again
you
re
an
artist
aren
t
you
no
i
said
busily
scraping
away
at
my
copperplate
i
m
an
archeologist
engaged
in
exhuming
an
ancient
ruin
from
a
square
mile
of
she
laughed
but
in
a
moment
became
grave
again
i
m
so
sorry
she
said
i
know
i
shouldn
t
come
plunging
around
turns
in
that
reckless
way
may
should
like
your
picture
you
may
not
i
replied
that
isn
t
quite
fair
is
it
she
asked
if
i
have
done
damage
i
should
be
allowed
to
repair
repair
said
i
how
do
you
propose
to
do
it
i
suppose
that
you
think
a
picture
that
can
be
bought
for
a
bill
can
be
painted
with
a
no
i
m
not
altogether
a
philistine
she
said
and
i
looked
up
at
her
for
the
first
time
her
and
comment
by
know
her
face
from
the
sketches
why
could
he
not
have
described
the
horse
however
there
s
one
point
clear
she
is
a
woman
of
she
said
i
don
t
wonder
you
re
cross
and
i
m
truly
sorry
is
it
quite
ruined
at
that
i
recovered
some
decency
of
manner
forgive
a
hermit
i
said
who
doesn
t
see
enough
people
to
keep
him
civilized
the
daub
doesn
t
she
leaned
over
from
the
saddle
to
examine
the
picture
oh
but
it
isn
t
a
daub
she
protested
know
a
little
about
pictures
it
s
very
interesting
and
curious
but
why
do
you
paint
it
on
copper
i
explained
oh
she
said
i
should
so
like
to
see
your
prints
nothing
easier
said
i
my
shack
is
just
over
the
and
there
is
a
her
eyes
suggested
that
i
fill
the
blank
sedgwick
i
finished
no
there
is
no
one
but
my
aged
and
highly
respectable
chinaman
to
play
propriety
but
in
the
case
of
a
studio
are
not
so
rigid
but
that
one
may
look
at
pictures
i
m
afraid
it
wouldn
t
do
she
answered
smiling
no
i
ll
have
to
wait
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
i
m
afraid
i
ll
have
to
give
it
chance
settled
that
point
then
and
there
as
she
finished
she
was
in
my
arms
the
girth
had
loosened
and
the
saddle
had
turned
with
her
i
had
barely
time
to
twist
her
foot
from
the
stirrup
when
the
brute
of
a
horse
bolted
as
it
was
her
ankle
got
a
bit
of
a
wrench
she
turned
quite
white
and
cried
out
a
little
in
a
moment
she
was
herself
again
king
cole
has
been
acting
badly
all
day
she
said
i
shall
have
a
time
catching
she
limped
forward
a
few
steps
here
that
won
t
do
said
i
let
you
couldn
t
get
near
perhaps
if
you
had
some
i
can
get
some
at
my
place
said
i
gathering
up
my
things
your
horse
is
headed
that
way
you
d
better
come
along
and
rest
there
while
ching
lung
and
i
round
up
your
by
follows
more
talk
showing
how
young
people
imperceptibly
and
unconsciously
cement
an
acquaintance
but
not
one
word
upon
the
vital
point
of
how
far
the
horse
seemed
to
have
come
whether
he
was
ridden
out
or
fresh
at
the
bungalow
i
called
ching
and
we
set
out
with
a
supply
of
salt
king
cole
by
a
was
coy
for
a
time
before
he
succumbed
to
temptation
on
my
return
i
found
my
visitor
in
the
studio
she
had
said
that
she
knew
a
little
about
pictures
she
knew
more
than
a
little
a
good
deal
in
fact
and
talked
most
intelligently
about
them
i
don
t
say
this
simply
because
she
tried
before
she
went
to
buy
some
of
mine
when
i
declined
to
sell
she
seemed
put
out
but
surely
these
prints
of
yours
aren
t
the
work
of
an
amateur
she
said
you
sell
oh
yes
i
i
can
but
i
don
t
sell
without
a
good
bit
of
bargaining
particularly
when
i
suspect
my
purchaser
of
wishing
to
make
amends
by
a
it
isn
t
that
at
all
she
said
earnestly
i
want
the
pictures
for
call
this
a
preliminary
then
and
come
back
when
you
have
more
she
shook
her
head
and
there
was
a
shadow
over
the
brightness
of
her
face
i
m
afraid
not
she
said
but
i
have
enjoyed
talking
again
with
some
one
who
knows
and
loves
the
best
in
art
after
all
she
added
with
a
note
of
determination
almost
of
defiance
there
is
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
then
i
may
look
for
you
again
i
asked
she
nodded
as
she
moved
out
across
the
porch
if
you
ll
promise
to
sell
me
any
print
i
may
choose
and
thank
you
so
much
sedgwick
she
held
out
her
hand
it
was
a
hand
for
a
sculptor
to
model
as
beautiful
and
full
of
character
as
her
face
by
afterward
i
remembered
that
never
again
in
our
friendship
did
i
see
it
ungloved
by
bosh
retracted
some
observation
in
that
au
revoir
then
i
said
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
you
see
i
don
t
know
what
to
call
you
at
she
hesitated
then
with
a
little
soft
quiver
of
her
eyelids
which
i
afterward
learned
to
identify
as
an
evidence
of
amusement
said
daw
is
a
nice
name
don
t
you
think
by
name
of
course
but
highly
probable
first
name
is
by
the
way
what
time
is
it
quarter
to
five
miss
she
smiled
at
the
name
king
cole
will
have
to
do
his
best
if
i
am
to
be
back
for
dinner
by
the
place
where
she
is
staying
is
a
good
way
off
assuming
a
say
twelve
to
fifteen
that
was
the
first
of
many
visits
of
days
that
grew
in
radiance
for
me
it
isn
t
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
kent
how
in
our
talks
i
came
to
divine
in
her
a
spirit
as
wistful
and
pure
as
her
face
you
do
not
want
a
love
story
from
me
yet
that
is
what
it
was
for
me
almost
from
the
first
not
openly
though
there
was
that
about
her
which
held
me
at
arms
length
the
mystery
of
her
her
trust
in
me
a
certain
strained
look
that
came
into
her
face
like
the
startled
attention
of
a
wild
thing
poised
for
flight
whenever
i
touched
upon
the
personal
note
not
that
i
ever
questioned
her
that
was
the
understanding
between
us
that
i
should
leave
to
her
her
without
effort
to
penetrate
it
while
i
talked
i
sketched
her
and
studied
her
young
as
she
seemed
she
had
been
much
about
the
world
knew
her
europe
had
met
and
talked
with
men
of
many
pursuits
and
had
taken
from
all
sources
tribute
for
her
mind
and
color
for
her
imagination
she
had
read
widely
too
and
had
an
individual
habit
of
thought
combined
with
all
her
cosmopolitanism
was
a
quaint
and
profound
purity
of
standards
i
remember
her
saying
was
one
of
her
rare
flashes
of
i
am
an
anomaly
and
an
anachronism
a
puritan
in
modern
after
her
first
visit
she
did
not
ride
on
her
horse
but
came
across
lots
and
through
the
side
hedge
swinging
down
the
hillside
yonder
with
her
light
dipping
stride
that
always
recalled
to
me
the
swoop
of
a
swallow
her
gloved
hands
usually
holding
a
slender
stick
all
those
sketches
that
you
saw
were
but
studies
for
a
more
serious
attempt
to
catch
and
fix
her
personality
by
t
he
have
given
me
in
two
words
her
height
and
approximate
weight
i
did
it
in
pastel
and
if
i
missed
something
of
her
tender
and
changeful
coloring
i
at
least
caught
the
ineffable
wistfulness
of
her
expression
the
look
of
one
hoping
against
hope
for
an
unconfessed
happiness
probably
i
had
put
more
of
myself
into
it
than
i
had
meant
a
man
is
likely
to
when
he
paints
with
his
heart
as
well
as
his
brain
and
hand
when
it
was
done
i
made
a
little
frame
for
it
and
lettered
on
the
frame
this
line
and
her
eyes
dreamed
against
a
distant
it
was
the
next
day
that
she
read
the
line
i
saw
the
color
die
from
her
face
and
flood
back
again
why
did
you
set
that
line
there
she
breathed
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
a
strange
expression
by
again
the
dead
woman
of
the
beach
quoted
the
house
of
life
why
not
i
asked
it
seems
to
express
something
in
you
which
i
have
tried
to
embody
in
the
picture
don
t
you
like
it
she
repeated
the
line
softly
making
pure
music
of
it
i
love
it
she
said
at
that
i
spoke
as
it
is
given
to
a
man
to
speak
to
one
woman
in
the
world
when
he
has
found
her
she
listened
with
her
eyes
on
the
pictured
face
but
when
i
said
to
her
you
who
have
all
my
heart
and
whose
name
even
i
have
there
no
word
for
me
she
rose
and
threw
out
her
hands
in
a
gesture
that
sent
a
chill
through
me
oh
no
no
she
cried
vehemently
oh
why
did
you
speak
i
stood
and
watched
her
go
at
the
end
of
the
garden
walk
she
stooped
and
picked
a
rose
with
her
gloved
fingers
and
as
she
disappeared
in
the
thicket
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
thought
she
half
turned
to
look
that
was
five
interminable
days
ago
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
feel
it
is
her
will
that
i
shall
never
see
her
again
and
i
must
you
understand
kent
you
must
find
her
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
when
i
was
sketching
her
i
asked
if
she
could
bring
something
pink
to
wear
preferably
coral
she
came
the
next
time
with
a
string
of
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
seen
set
in
a
most
curious
old
gold
design
it
was
that
necklace
and
none
other
that
the
woman
with
the
bundle
wore
half
concealed
when
she
came
here
is
yesterday

i

francis
sedgwick
asked
of
himself
when
he
emerged
upon
his
porch
the
morning
after
kent
s
visit
the
occasion
of
this
query
was
a
man
stretched
flat
on
the
lawn
with
his
feet
propped
up
comfortably
against
the
stone
wall
in
this
recumbent
posture
he
was
achieving
the
somewhat
delicate
feat
of
smoking
a
long
thin
clay
pipe
except
for
this
plebeian
touch
he
was
of
the
most
unimpeachable
elegance
his
white
serge
suit
was
freshly
pressed
his
lavender
silk
hose
descending
without
a
wrinkle
under
his
buckskin
shoes
accorded
with
a
lavender
silk
tie
and
lavender
striped
shirt
a
soft
white
hat
covered
his
eyes
against
the
sun
glare
to
put
a
point
to
this
foppishness
a
narrow
silken
ribbon
also
pure
white
depending
from
his
lapel
buttonhole
suggested
an
in
his
pocket
sedgwick
who
had
risen
late
having
returned
to
his
house
at
daybreak
after
delivering
his
manuscript
at
kent
s
hotel
regarded
this
sartorial
marvel
with
a
doubt
as
to
whether
it
might
not
be
a
figment
of
latent
dreams
making
a
détour
across
the
grass
he
attained
to
a
side
view
of
the
interloper
s
face
it
repaid
the
trouble
it
was
a
remarkable
face
both
in
contour
and
in
coloring
from
chin
to
cheek
the
skin
was
white
with
a
tint
of
blue
showing
beneath
but
the
central
parts
of
the
face
were
bronzed
the
jaw
was
long
lean
and
bony
the
were
high
the
mouth
was
large
and
firm
the
nose
solid
set
like
a
rock
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
the
man
pushed
his
hat
downward
revealing
a
knobby
forehead
and
eyes
in
which
there
was
a
touch
of
somberness
of
brooding
the
artist
remembered
having
seen
that
type
of
physiognomy
on
the
venetian
coins
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
likenesses
in
bronze
of
men
who
were
of
iron
and
gold
rulers
and
poets
the
eyes
of
the
still
face
opened
wide
and
fixed
themselves
on
sedgwick
and
the
expression
of
melancholy
vanished
good
morning
said
the
artist
and
then
all
but
recoiled
from
the
voice
that
replied
so
harsh
and
raucous
it
was
you
rise
late
it
said
i
hear
your
opinion
on
it
retorted
sedgwick
a
bit
nettled
am
i
to
infer
that
you
have
been
waiting
for
me
you
wouldn
t
go
far
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
leave
said
sedgwick
significantly
take
a
little
walk
with
me
presently
said
the
man
in
another
voice
brushing
the
hat
clear
of
his
face
kent
exclaimed
the
artist
well
you
appear
surprised
what
kind
of
artist
are
you
not
to
recognize
a
man
simply
because
he
shaves
his
beard
and
affects
a
false
voice
but
you
re
so
completely
changed
and
why
this
disguise
disguise
returned
the
other
astonished
in
his
turn
i
m
not
in
your
clothes
they
except
for
being
offensive
i
d
call
them
not
at
all
protested
the
other
warmly
just
because
i
m
a
scientific
man
is
it
to
be
assumed
that
i
ought
to
be
a
frump
i
m
fond
of
good
clothes
i
can
afford
good
clothes
i
wear
good
clothes
it
s
a
hobby
of
mine
but
i
deny
that
it
is
a
of
course
not
assented
the
other
somewhat
amused
by
the
way
though
your
socks
and
tie
don
t
they
do
absolutely
replied
the
other
with
asperity
perhaps
in
fact
but
not
in
effect
in
matching
smooth
silk
with
ribbed
silk
you
should
get
the
latter
one
shade
is
that
so
said
kent
with
interest
you
ve
told
me
something
i
never
knew
i
ll
remember
that
now
i
ll
trouble
you
to
tell
me
some
more
while
taking
that
walk
you
spoke
of
that
comes
later
i
ve
read
your
already
already
do
you
know
it
s
ten
o
clock
however
it
s
a
good
thank
as
a

as

it

most
of
the
important

you

color
size
and
trappings
of
the
horse
i
didn
t
notice
particularly
black
i
think
yes
certainly
black
rather

large
horse
that
s
all
i
can
tell
humph
color
size
and
trappings
of
the
rider
reddish
brown
hair
with
a
gloss
like
a
butterfly
s
wing
said
the
artist
with
enthusiasm
deep
hazel
eyes
clear
skin
should
say
quite
feminine
that
you
wouldn
t
realize
her
tallness
she
was
dressed
in
a
light
brown
riding
costume
with
a
toque
hat
very
simple
tan
gauntlets
and
tan
boots
that
is
the
first
time
i
saw
her
the
next
hold
on
a
dressmaker
s
catalogue
is
no
good
to
me
i
couldn
t
remember
it
all
was
she
in
riding
clothes
on
any
of
her
later
visits
any
scars
or
marks
certainly
not
that
s
a
pity
although
you
seem
to
think
otherwise
age
twenty
add
five
say
what
for
demanded
sedgwick
indignantly
i
m
allowing
for
the
discount
of
romance
did
you
notice
her
boots
not
particularly
except
that
she
was
always
spick
and
span
from
head
to
humph
was
it
pretty
warm
the
last
week
she
called
on
you
piping
did
she
show
it
never
a
bit
always
looked
fresh
as
a
then
although
she
came
far
she
didn
t
walk
far
to
get
here
there
s
a
road
back
of
the
hill
yonder
and
a
little
copse
in
an
open
field
where
a
has
stood
i
should
say
that
she
had
driven
herself
there
and
come
across
the
hill
to
could
we
track
the
car
asked
sedgwick
eagerly
no
farther
than
the
main
road
what
is
the
latest
she
ever
left
here
when
she
arrived
afoot
once
she
stayed
till
half
past
six
i
begged
her
to
stay
and
dine
but
she
drew
into
herself
at
the
mere
half
past
six
allowing
for
a
half
past
seven
dinner
and
time
to
dress
for
it
she
would
have
perhaps
twelve
to
fifteen
miles
to
go
in
the
car
that
figures
out
with
the
saddle
ride
too
now
we
have
as
your
visitor
a
woman
of
rather
inadequate
description
eked
out
by
some
excellent
passably
don
t
lose
your
temper
sedgwick
passably
with
command
of
some
wealth
athletic
a
traveler
well
informed
the
name
she
gave
is
obviously
not
her
own
not
even
i
judge
her
maiden
sedgwick
turned
very
white
do
you
mean
that
she
is
a
married
woman
he
demanded
how
could
you
have
failed
to
see
it
returned
the
other
gently
but
what
is
there
to
prove
it
proof
none
indication
plenty
her
visits
in
the
first
place
a
young
girl
of
breeding
and
social
experience
would
hardly
have
come
to
your
studio
a
married
woman
might
who
respected
herself
with
full
confidence
and
knew
with
the
same
confidence
that
you
would
respect
her
and
my
dear
boy
added
kent
with
his
quiet
winning
smile
you
are
a
man
to
inspire
confidence
otherwise
i
myself
might
have
suspected
you
of
having
a
hand
in
the
death
of
the
woman
on
the
never
mind
the
woman
on
the
beach
this
other
matter
is
more
than
life
or
death
is
that
flimsy
supposition
all
you
have
to
go
on
no
her
travel
her
wide
acquaintance
with
men
and
events
her
obvious
all
might
be
found
in
a
very
exceptional
girl
such
as
she
is
why
shouldn
t
she
tell
me
if
she
were
married
oh
don
t
expect
me
to
dissect
feminine
psychology
there
i
m
quite
beyond
my
depth
but
you
ll
note
she
doesn
t
seem
to
have
told
you
any
slightest
thing
about
herself
she
s
let
concealment
like
a
worm
i
the
bud
prey
on
damask
confound
your
misquotations
it
s
true
though
but
there
might
be
many
doubtless
only
my
imagination
doesn
t
seem
to
run
to
them
and
reverting
to
tangible
fact
as
clenching
evidence
there
are
her
gloves
which
she
always
what
about
her
gloves
you
never
saw
her
left
hand
did
you
oh
i
see
you
mean
the
well
i
suppose
continued
sedgwick
with
a
tinge
of
contempt
in
his
voice
she
could
have
taken
off
her
ring
as
easily
as
her
there
was
no
answering
contempt
in
chester
kent
s
voice
as
he
replied
but
a
ring
constantly
worn
and
then
removed
leaves
an
unmistakable
mark
perhaps
she
gave
you
greater
credit
for
powers
of
observation
than
you
deserve
i
m
afraid
frank
that
she
is
a
married
woman
and
i
m
sure
from
reading
between
your
lines
that
she
is
a
good
woman
what
the
connection
between
her
and
the
corpse
on
the
beach
may
be
is
the
problem
my
immediate
business
is
to
discover
who
the
dead
woman
and
mine
said
sedgwick
hoarsely
to
discover
the
we
ll
at
least
start
together
replied
kent
come
capacity
for
silence
that
gift
of
the
restful
gods
was
possessed
by
both
men
intent
each
upon
his
own
thoughts
they
strode
up
the
hillside
and
descended
into
a
byway
where
stood
a
light
runabout
empty
throwing
on
the
switch
kent
motioned
his
companion
to
get
in
twenty
minutes
of
curving
and
dodging
along
the
rocky
roads
brought
them
to
the
turnpike
in
sight
of
the
town
of
annalaka
not
until
then
did
kent
offer
a
word
the
inquest
is
set
for
eleven
o
clock
he
said
all
right
said
sedgwick
with
equal
taciturnity
they
turned
a
corner
and
ran
into
the
fringe
of
a
crowd
hovering
about
the
town
hall
halting
his
machine
in
a
bit
of
shade
kent
surveyed
the
gathering
at
one
point
it
thickened
about
a
man
who
was
talking
eagerly
the
vocal
center
of
a
small
circle
of
silence
elder
dennett
said
kent
back
from
cadystown
you
ll
have
to
face
the
music
i
m
you
re
ready
for
attack
are
you
ready
for
surprises
no
one
is
ever
ready
for
surprise
or
it
wouldn
t
be
surprise
would
it
true
enough
one
word
of
warning
don
t
lose
your
head
or
your
temper
if
the
suspicion
raised
against
you
by
dennett
is
strengthened
by
by
you
unfortunately
my
concern
is
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
matter
there
is
something
the
sheriff
knows
that
i
don
t
know
probably
it
is
the
identity
of
the
body
to
force
him
into
the
open
it
may
be
necessary
for
me
to
augment
the
case
against
ought
i
to
be
ready
for
arrest
hardly
probable
at
present
no
go
on
the
stand
when
you
re
called
and
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
but
not
the
whole
truth
nothing
of
the
necklace
you
won
t
be
questioned
about
that
by
the
way
you
have
never
kept
among
your
artistic
properties
anything
in
the
way
of
handcuffs
have
you
i
didn
t
suppose
you
had
those
manacles
are
a
sticker
i
don
absolutely
do
like
those
manacles
and
on
one
wrist
only
perhaps
that
is
the
very
fact
we
shall
know
more
when
we
re
older
two
hours
older
say
whether
we
shall
know
all
that
sheriff
len
schlager
knows
is
another
question
i
don
t
like
schlager
either
for
that
dennett
has
seen
me
said
sedgwick
in
a
low
voice
indeed
the
narrator
s
voice
had
abruptly
ceased
and
he
stood
with
the
dropped
jaw
of
stupefaction
one
after
another
of
his
auditors
turned
and
stared
at
the
two
men
in
the
stay
where
you
are
said
kent
and
stepped
out
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
no
one
recognized
at
first
the
immaculate
as
the
bearded
scientist
whose
strange
actions
had
amused
the
crowd
on
the
beach
a
heavy
solemn
man
addressed
him
friend
of
his
he
asked
nodding
toward
the
artist
he
ll
need
em
going
to
give
evidence
to
hear
it
rather
replied
kent
pleasantly
where
s
the
body
inside
just
brought
it
over
from
doctor
breed
s
he
s
the
medical
officer
and
he
and
the
sheriff
are
running
the
show
your
friend
want
a
lawyer
maybe
the
thought
struck
kent
that
while
a
lawyer
might
be
premature
a
friend
in
the
town
might
be
very
useful
yes
he
said
from
meanin
that
you
re
in
charge
surmised
the
big
man
shrewdly
kent
smiled
i
dare
say
we
shall
get
on
very
well
together
his
voice
went
up
interrogatively

and

for

years
in

of

you
my

name
what
kind
of
man
is
this

not
much
more
of
a
politician
than
a
doctor
and
more
of
a

than
either
fidgety
as

did
he
perform
the
autopsy
at
his
own
house
him
and
the
sheriff
last
evening
didn
t
even
have
an
undertaker
to
help
lay
the
lobe
of
kent
s
ear
began
to
suffer
from
repeated
handling
the
body
hasn
t
been
identified
i
suppose
nobody
s
had
so
much
as
a
wink
at
it
but
those
two
and
ira
dennett
he
viewed
the
corpse
last
night
that
s
why
i
guess
your
friend
needs
friends
and
maybe
a
exactly
dennett
doesn
t
seem
to
be
precisely

deaf

bain
emitted
the
bubbling
chuckle
of
the
it
s
quite
some
time
since
iry
won
any
prizes
for
silent
thought
he
stated
you
are

he
added
after
a
pause
very
gansett
jim

looks
as
if
he
kinder
cherished
the
honor
of
your
over
his
shoulder
kent
caught
the
s
glance
fixed
upon
him
with
stolid
intensity
a
touch
on
his
arm
made
him
turn
to
the
other
side
where

faced
him

hardly
know

exclaimed

kent
nodded
why

no
reason
at
all
said
the
old
seaman
hastily
it
s
a
public
proceedin
but
you
re
surprised
to
see
him
here
there
s
been
quite
a
lot
o
suspicion
you
people
are
inclined
to
connect
sedgwick
with
the
death
of
the
woman
what
else
can
you
expect
returned
the
old
man
deprecatingly
iry
dennett

been
tellin
his
story

certain

talkin
to

as
as
iry

and
probably
with
reason
muttered
kent
well
i
ll
look
for
you
he
returned
to
join
sedgwick
together
they
entered
the
building
while
behind
them
a
rising
hum
testified
to
the
interest
felt
in
them
by
the
villagers
within
a
tall
wizened
man
with
dead
fishy
eyes
stalked
nervously
to
and
fro
on
a
platform
beside
which
a
hastily
constructed
coffin
with
a
hasped
cover
stood
on
three
sawhorses
on
a
chair
near
by
slouched
the
sheriff
his
face
red
and
streaming
a
few
perspiring
men
and
women
were
scattered
on
the
benches
outside
a
clock
struck
eleven
there
was
a
quick
inflow
of
the
populace
and
the
man
on
the
platform
lifted
up
a
chittering
voice
feller
citizens
he
said
as
medical
officer
i
declare
these
proceedings
opened
meaning
no
disrespect
to
the
deceased
we
want
to
get
through
as
spry
as
possible
first
we
will
hear
witnesses
anybody
who
thinks
he
can
throw
any
light
on
this
business
can
have
a
hearing
then
those
as
wants
may
view
the
remains
the
burial
will
take
place
right
afterwards
in
the
town
buryin
our
feller
citizen
and
sheriff
len
schlager
having
volunteered
the
that
man
said
sedgwick
in
kent
s
ear
is
a
great
deal
more
nervous
this
minute
than
i
perhaps
he
has
more
cause
to
be
whispered
the
scientist
here
comes
the
first
a
had
risen
in
his
place
and
without
the
formality
of
an
oath
told
of
sighting
the
body
at
the
edge
of
the
surf
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
others
following
testified
to
the
position
on
the
beach
the
lashing
of
the
body
to
the
grating
the
wounds
and
the
manacles
doctor
breed
announced
briefly
that
the
deceased
had
come
to
her
death
by
drowning
and
that
the
skull
had
been
crushed
in
presumably
when
the
waves
hammered
the
body
upon
the
reefs
then
the
corpse
must
have
come
from
a
good
ways
out
said
sailor
smith
for
the
reefs
wouldn
t
catch
it
at
that
nobody
knows
how
the
dead
come
to
lonesome
cove
said
the
sheriff
in
his
deep
voice
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
the
people
felt
a
certain
pride
in
the
locality
elder
ira
dennett
was
the
next
and
last
witness
called
somewhere
beneath
the
elder
s
dry
exterior
lurked
the
instinct
of
the
drama
stalking
to
the
platform
he
told
his
story
with
skill
and
fervor
he
made
a
telling
point
of
the
newly
finished
picture
he
had
seen
in
sedgwick
s
studio
depicting
the
moonlit
charge
of
the
corpse
he
sketched
out
the
encounter
between
the
artist
and
the
dead
woman
vividly
as
he
proceeded
the
glances
turned
upon
sedgwick
darkened
from
suspicion
to
enmity
kent
was
almost
ready
to
wish
that
he
had
come
armed
when
dennett
with
a
final
fling
of
his
arm
toward
the
artist
stepped
from
the
platform
and
resumed
his
seat
amid
a
surcharged
silence
then
sedgwick
rose
he
was
white
but
his
voice
was
under
perfect
control
as
he
said
i
presume
i
have
the
right
to
be
heard
in
my
own
defense
nobody
s
accused
you
yet
growled
schlager
public
opinion
accuses
me
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
view
of
what
elder
dennett
has
just
told
you
it
is
all
true
but
i
do
not
know
the
woman
who
accosted
me
i
never
saw
her
before
that
evening
she
spoke
strangely
to
me
and
indicated
that
she
was
to
meet
some
one
and
go
aboard
ship
though
i
saw
no
sign
of
a
you
couldn
t
see
much
of
the
ocean
from
your
house
said
the
medical
officer
i
walked
on
the
cliffs
later
said
sedgwick
and
a
murmur
went
through
the
court
room
but
i
never
found
the
woman
and
as
for
throwing
her
out
of
a
ship
or
any
such
fantastic
nonsense
i
can
prove
that
i
was
back
in
my
house
by
a
little
after
nine
o
clock
that
he
sat
down
coolly
enough
but
his
eyes
dilated
when
kent
whispered
to
him
keep
your
nerve
the
probability
will
be
shown
that
she
was
killed
before
ten
o
now
however
doctor
breed
was
on
his
feet
again

and
gentlemen
said
he
and

the
coffin
as
spry

at
this
sheriff
schlager
stepped
forward
and
loosened
the
hasps
preparatory
to
removing
the
cover
the
body

been
left
said
he
slipping
the
lid
aside
just
of
a
sudden
his
eyes
stiffened
a
convulsive
shudder
ran
through
his
big
body
he
jammed
the
cover
back
and
with
fingers
that
actually
drummed
on
the
wood
forced
the
hasps
into
place
she
s
come
to
life
cried
a
voice
from
the
rear
no
no
rumbled
the
sheriff
whirling
upon
the
medical
officer
he
whispered
in
his
ear
not
more
than
a
single
word
it
seemed
to
the
watchful
kent
the
doctor
turned
ghastly
gents
he
said
in
a
quavering
voice
to
the
amazed
crowd
the
program
will
not
be
carried
out
as
arranged
the
condition
of
the
deceased
is
not
he
stopped
mopping
his
brow
but
yankee
curiosity
was
not
so
easily
to
be
balked
of
its
food
it
found
expression
in
lawyer
adam
bain
that
ain

said

declared

himself
solidly
between

and
the
coffin
one

crept
slowly
back
toward
his
hip
don

retorted
the
lawyer
quietly
it
ain
t
you
heard
doc
breed
say
the
body
wasn

fitten
to
be
viewed
pursued
the
sheriff
that
s
all
right
too
but
the
doc
hasn
t
got
the
final
word
the
law
a
quick
murmur
of
assent
passed
through
the
room
and
the
law
says
continued
bain
that
the
body
shall
be
duly
viewed

kent
to
sedgwick
the
medical
officer
s
lips
were
gray
as
he
leaned
forward
to
pluck
at
the
sheriff
s
arm
there
was
a
whispered
colloquy
between
them
then
breed
spoke
with
a
pitiful
effort
at
lawyer
bain
s
point
is
correct
undoubtedly
correct
but
the

must
be
prepared

night
but
somehow
six
citizens
kindly
volunteer
to
fetch
the
coffin
back
to
my
house
ten
times
six
offered
their
services
the
box
was
carried
out
swiftly
followed
by
the
variable
hum
of
excited
conjecture
quickly
the
room
emptied
itself

for
a
few
stragglers
chapter

for
a
monocle
sedgwick
who
had
followed
the
impromptu
cortège
with
his
vision
was
brought
up
sharply
by
the
glare
of
a
pair
of
eyes
outside
the
nearest
window
the
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
own
their
expression
was
distinctly
malevolent
without
looking
round
sedgwick
said
in
a
low
voice
kent
no
answer
came
kent
said
the
artist
a
little
louder
huh
responded
a
muffled
and
abstracted
voice
behind
him
see
here
for
a
there
was
neither
sound
nor
movement
from
the
scientist
an
chap
outside
the
window
is
trying
to
hypnotize
me
or
something
of
the
this
information
deemed
by
its
giver
to
be
of
no
small
interest
elicited
not
the
faintest
response
somewhat
piqued
the
artist
turned
to
behold
his
friend
stretched
on
a
bench
with
face
to
the
ceiling
eyes
closed
and
heels
on
the
raised
end
his
lips
moved
faintly
alarmed
lest
the
heat
had
been
too
much
for
him
sedgwick
bent
over
the
upturned
face
from
the
moving
lips
issued
a
musical
breath
which
began
its
career
softly
as
raff
s
and
came
to
an
inglorious
end
in
the
strains
of
sedgwick
shook
the
whistler
insistently
eh
what
cried
kent
wrenching
his
shoulder
free
go
away
can
t
you
see
i
m
busy
i
ll
give
you
something
to
think
about
look
at
this
face
of
a
indian
at
the
window
no
it
s
gone
gansett
jim
probably
opined
kent
just
where
his
interest
in
this
case
comes
in
i
haven
t
yet
found
out
he
favored
me
with
his
regard
outside
and
he
had
some
dealings
with
the
sheriff
on
the
beach
but
i
don
t
want
to
talk
about
him
now
nor
about
anything
acting
on
this
hint
sedgwick
let
his
companion
severely
alone
until
a
bustle
from
without
warned
him
that
the
crowd
was
returning
being
aroused
kent
accosted
one
of
the
villagers
who
had
just
entered
body
coming
back
he
asked
yep
on
its
way
what
occurred
in
the
house
where
they
took
it
search
me
everybody
was
shut
out
by
the
sheriff
and
the
doc
they
had
that
body
to
theirselves
nigh
twenty
at
this
moment
the
sheriff
entered
the
hall
followed
by
doctor
breed
who
escorted
the
coffin
to
its
supporting
sawhorses
the
meager
physician
was
visibly
at
the
fag
end
of
his
even
the
burly
sheriff
looked
like
a
sick
man
as
he
lifted
aside
the
coffin
lid
and
spoke
there
was
reasons
neighbors
said
he
why
the
corpse
wasn
t
suitable
to
be
looked
at
nobody
had
seen
it
since
last
night
we
ve
fixed
it
up
as
good
as
we
could
and
you
ll
now
please
pass
by
as
quick
as
in
the
line
that
formed
kent
got
a
place
behind
elder
dennett
who
had
decided
to
take
another
look
for
good
measure
as
he
said
the
look
was
a
productive
one
no
sooner
had
it
fallen
on
the
face
of
the
dead
than
dennett
jabbed
an
indicatory
finger
in
that
direction
and
addressed
the
sheriff
hey
len
what
s
this
what
s
what
growled
schlager
why
there
s
a
cut
on
the
lady
s
right
cheek
it
wasn
t
there
when
i
seen
the
corpse
last
ah
what
s
the
matter
with
your
eyes
demanded
the
sheriff
savagely
you
want
to
hog
the
that
s
your
trouble
this
was
evidently
a
shrewd
lash
at
a
recognized
weakness
and
the
elder
moved
on
amid
jeering
comments
but
sedgwick
whose
eyes
had
been
fixed
upon
kent
saw
a
curious
expression
flicker
and
fade
across
the
face
it
was
exactly
the
expression
of
a
dog
that
pricks
up
its
ears
the
next
moment
a
titter
ran
through
the
crowd
as
a
bumpkin
in
a
rear
seat
called
out
the
dude
s
eyes
ain
t
mates
chester
kent
already
conspicuous
in
his
spotless
white
flannels
had
made
himself
doubly
so
by
drawing
out
a
monocle
and
deftly
fixing
it
in
his
right
eye
he
leaned
over
the
body
to
look
into
the
face
and
his
head
jerked
back
the
merest
trifle
bending
lower
he
scrutinized
the
unmanacled
right
wrist
when
he
passed
on
his
lips
were
pursed
in
the
manner
of
one
who
whistles
noiselessly
he
resumed
his
seat
beside
sedgwick
his
eyes
grew
dull
and
melancholy
one
would
have
thought
him
sunk
in
a
daze
or
a
doze
while
the
procession
filed
past
the
unknown
dead
his
monocle
which
had
dropped
from
his
eye
as
he
turned
from
the
coffin
dangled
against
his
hand
chancing
to
look
down
at
it
sedgwick
started
and
stared
kent
s
knuckle
as
seen
through
the
glass
stood
forth
monstrous
and
distorted
every
line
of
the
bronzed
skin
showing
like
a
furrow
the
monocle
was
a
powerful
magnifying
lens
the
sheriff
s
heavy
voice
rose
any
one
here
present
recognize
or
identify
the
deceased
he
droned
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
set
the
lid
in
place
and
signaled
to
the
medical
officer
feller
citizens
began
the
still
shaking
physician
we
don
t
need
any
jury
to
find
that
this
unknown
drowned
the
deceased
was
not
emerging
from
his
reverie
chester
kent
had
leisurely
risen
in
his
place
and
made
his
statement
drowned
gasped
the
medical
man
certainly
not
as
you
must
know
if
you
made
an
no
autopsy
was
necessary
replied
the
other
quickly
there
s
plenty
of
testimony
without
that
we
ve
heard
the
witnesses
that
saw
the
drowned
body
on
the
grating
it
washed
ashore
the
body
never
washed
ashore
on
that
a
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
how
do
you
figure
that
called
a
voice
on
the
under
side
of
the
grating
i
found
a
cocoon
of
a
common
moth
half
an
hour
in
the
water
would
have
soaked
the
cocoon
through
and
killed
the
insect
inhabitant
the
insect
was
how
d
the
grating
get
there
then
dragged
down
from
the
mark
on
the
beach
it
was
an
old
affair
such
as
no
ship
would
carry
ask
sailor
that
s
true
said
the
old
seaman
with
conviction
you
re
an
expert
smith
now
was
that
grating
large
enough
to
float
a
full
grown
human
body
why
as
to
that
a
body
ain
t
but
a
mite
heavier
than
the
water
i
should
say
it
d
just
barely
float
it
exactly
but
plus
several
pounds
of
clothing
and
some
dead
metal
extra
the
clothes
would
have
been
soaked
and
handcuffs
weigh
something
said
kent
calmly
there
might
have
been
extra
spars
under
the
grating
that
got
pounded
loose
on
the
beach
and
washed
away
propounded
the
medical
officer
desperately
look
at
the
face
said
kent
with
finality
this
is
a
bad
coast
most
of
you
have
seen
drowned
bodies
did
any
one
ever
see
an
expression
of
such
terror
and
agony
on
the
face
of
one
who
came
to
death

drowning

echoed
a
voice
from
the
no

shouted
somebody
he

others
took
up
the
cry
clamor
rose
and
spread
in
the
room
the
sheriff
silenced
it
with
a
stentorian
voice
what
are
you
trying
to
get
at
he
demanded
facing
kent
the
truth
what
are

eyelids
flickered
but
he
ignored
the
look

you
where

he
returned
with
a
significant
look
at
sedgwick
this
is
as
far
as
it
has
led
me
said
kent
in
his
clear
even
voice
the
body
already
dead
was
dragged
down
and
soaked
in
the
sea
and
then
lashed
to
the
grating

where
was
you
if
it
comes
to
that
retorted
the
sheriff
and
bit
his
lip
with
a
scowl
at
that
betrayal
chester
kent
s
eyelids
flashed
up
and
instantly
drooped
again
into
somberness
this
hearing
is
adjourned
twittered
the

officer
burial

the
unknown
will
take
place
at
once
all
are
invitation
respectfully
declined
murmured
sedgwick
to
kent
i
don
t
know
that
i
m
exactly
frightened
but
i
think
i
d
breathe
easier
in
the
open
well
i
m
exactly
frightened
replied
kent
in
the
same
tone
i
want
to
would
probably
be
the
end
of
us
curious
things
about
those
handcuffs
isn
t
it
he
went
on
in
a
louder
and
easily
conversational
voice
during
their
slow
progress
to
the
door
he
kept
up
a
running
comment
which
sedgwick
supported
with
equal
coolness
the
crowd
darkling
and
undecided
pressed
around
them
as
they
went
through
the
doorway
they
were
jostled
by
a
sudden
pressure
following
which
kent
felt
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
to
face
the
sheriff
better
get
out
of
town
quick
advised
schlager
in
a
half
whisper
thank
you
said
kent
in
a
clear
and
cheerful
voice
where
can
i
get
some
tobacco
sterrett
s
grocery
keeps
the
best
said
some
informant
back
of
him
end
of
the
square
to
the
much
obliged
said
kent
and
strolled
leisurely
to
his
car
followed
by
sedgwick
as
they
took
their
seats
and
started
slowly
through
the
crowd
sedgwick
inquired
earnestly
do
you
crave
tobacco
at
this
particular
moment
worse
than
you
do
the
peace
and
loneliness
of
the
green
fields
policy
my
young
friend
retorted
kent
i
wish
i
could
think
up
a
dozen
more
errands
to
do
the
more
casually
we
get
out
of
town
the
less
likely
we
are
to
be
followed
by
a
flight
of
rocks
i
don
t
want
a
perfectly
good
runabout
spoiled
by
a
both
of
them
went
into
sterrett
s
store
where
kent
earned
the
reputation
from
sterrett
of
being
awful
dang
choosy
about
what
he
gets
and
came
out
into
a
considerable
part
of
the
populace
which
had
followed
as
they
reëmbarked
the
sheriff
put
his
foot
on
the
better
take
my
tip
he
said
significantly
very
well
returned
kent
there
will
be
no
arrest
then
not
just
a
peculiar
smile
slid
sidewise
off
a
corner
of
the
scientist
s
long
jaw
nor
at
any
other
time
he
concluded
he
threw
in
the
clutch
leaving
schlager
with
his
hand
in
his
hair
and
the
crowd
which
might
so
easily
have
become
a
mob
to
disperse
slowly
and
hesitantly
having
lacked
the
incentive
of
suggested
flight
on
the
part
of
the
suspects
to
be
spark
to
its
powder
when
the
car
had
won
the
open
road
beyond
the
village
sedgwick
remarked
queer
line
the
sheriff
is
poor
schlager
said
kent
chuckling
no
other
line
is
open
to
him
he
s
in
a
tight
place
but
it
isn
t
the
sheriff
that
s
worrying
who
then
gansett
what
did
the
sheriff
mean
by
asking
gansett
jim
where
he
was
the
night
of
the
murder
murder
said
kent
quizzically
what
murder
the
murder
of
the
unknown
woman
of
i
don
t
know
that
there
was
any
oh
well
the
death
of
the
unknown
woman
i
don
t
know
that
there
was
any
unknown
quit
it
from
what
you
do
know
what
do
you
think
the
sheriff
meant
what
do
think
i
think
that
gansett
jim
killed
her
and
is
trying
to
turn
suspicion
on
humph
but
if
the
sheriff
knows
where
gansett
jim
was
at
the
time
of
the
killing
he
can
t
suppose
me
guilty
i
wonder
if
he
really
does
believe
me
guilty
if
he
does
he
doesn
t
care
his
concern
is
quite
apart
from
your
it
s
too
much
for
me
confessed
the
artist
and
for
me
that
is
why
i
am
going
back
to
the
but
i
thought
you
were
if
i
stayed
away
from
everything
that
alarms
me
said
kent
i
d
never
have
a
tooth
filled
or
speak
to
a
woman
under
seventy
i
m
a
timid
soul
sedgwick
but
i
don
t
think
i
shall
be
in
any
danger
in
annalaka
so
long
as
i
m
alone
here
we
are
out
with
you
i
ll
be
back
by
chapter
groot
does
business
to
his
surprise
kent
turning
into
the
village
square
found
the
crowd
still
lingering
a
new
focus
of
interest
had
drawn
it
to
a
spot
opposite
sterrett
s
store
where
a
wagon
decorated
in
the
most
advanced
style
of
circus
art
shone
brilliant
in
yellow
and
green
bright
red
letters
across
the
front
presented
to
public
admiration
the
legend
simon
groot
simon
pure
goods
a
stout
projection
rested
on
one
of
the
rear
wheels
here
stood
the
proprietor
of
the
vehicle
while
behind
him
in
a
window
were
displayed
his
wares
it
was
evident
that
simon
groot
followed
the
romantic
career
of
an
itinerant
hawker
dealing
in
that
wide
range
of
commodities
roughly
comprised
in
the
quaint
term
yankee
before
the
merchandizing
voice
came
to
the
new
arrival
s
ears
as
anything
more
than
a
confused
jumble
kent
was
struck
with
the
expansive
splendor
of
the
man
s
gestures
the
dignity
of
his
robust
figure
and
the
beauty
of
a
broad
whitening
beard
that
spread
sidewise
like
the
ripples
from
a
boat
s
stem
two
blemishes
unhappily
marred
the
majesty
of
simon
groot
s
presence
a
pair
of
eyes
mutually
attracted
to
each
other
and
a
mean
and
stringent
little
voice
freed
of
these
drawbacks
his
oratory
might
well
one
could
not
but
feel
have
rolled
in
any
of
our
legislative
chambers
more
superbly
and
just
as
ineffectually
as
much
of
the
other
oratory
therein
practised
that
the
annalakans
were
truly
spellbound
by
it
was
obvious
indeed
kent
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
depth
of
their
absorption
until
he
had
come
within
the
scope
of
the
words
there
gentlemen
and
ladies
simon
groot
was
saying
there
in
that
place
of
vast
silences
and
infolding
shadows
i
met
and
addressed
one
who
was
soon
to
be
no
more
madam
i
said
you
are
worn
you
are
wan
you
are
weary
trust
the
chivalry
of
one
who
might
be
your
father
rest
and
be
comforted
as
with
standing
by
the
roadside
she
drooped
like
a
flower
there
is
no
rest
for
me
said
she
in
mournful
tones
i
must
away
upon
my
stay
i
bade
her
ere
you
go
but
touch
your
lips
to
this
revivifying
flagon
de
lorimer
s
life
giving
tonic
free
from
intoxicants
poisons
and
deception
a
boon
to
the
blood
a
balm
to
the
nerves
a
prop
to
the
flagging
she
looked
she
tasted
she
drank
new
color
sprang
to
her
cheeks
her
form
pulsated
with
joyous
vigor
aged
sir
said
she
i
know
not
your
name
but
if
the
blessings
of
a
harried
spirit
are
of
avail
your
sleep
will
be
sweet
this
of
this
wonderful
balm
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
annalaka
i
have
still
a
few
bottles
left
at
the
low
price
of
half
a
dollar
each
sickness
flies
before
it
amalgamating
at
once
with
the
blood
it
clears
the
precious
life
fluid
of
all
impurities
and
rehabilitates
man
woman
and
child
body
soul
and
the
shrill
voice
rose
and
fell
the
wide
beard
quivered
with
the
passion
of
salesmanship
the
gaudy
bottles
on
the
shelf
were
replaced
by
until
the
market
flagged
whereupon
again
the
orator
took
up
his
tale
ever
shall
i
give
thanks
for
that
inestimable
privilege
the
privilege
of
having
given
cheer
to
one
on
the
brink
of
a
dreadful
doom
she
vanished
that
fair
creature
into
the
forest
i
looked
at
my
unerring
warranted
chronometer
which
i
shall
presently
have
the
honor
of
showing
to
you
at
the
unexampled
price
of
saw
that
the
hour
was
these
timepieces
vary
not
one
fraction
of
a
second
in
a
when
next
i
looked
at
the
face
of
father
time
s
trustiest
accountant
it
was
to
mark
the
hour
of
the
horrid
shriek
that
shook
my
soul
precisely
and
later
when
i
heard
the
dread
news
i
realized
that
my
ears
had
thrilled
to
a
death
he
looked
about
him
with
a
face
of
controlled
emotion
his
voice
dropped
to
a
throaty
and
mesmeric
gurgle
how
frail
he
continued
how
frail
and
uncertain
is
the
life
of
mankind
who
of
these
happy
faces
before
me
may
not
be
bathed
in
tears
for
the
loss
of
some
loved
one
best
be
prepared
against
the
time
of
sorrow
i
show
you
here
a
unique
collection
of
framed
mottoes
suitable
alike
for
the
walls
of
the
humblest
home
or
the
grandest
palace
within
these
tasty
frames
are
enshrined
comforting
mortuary
verses
delicately
ornamented
by
the
hands
of
our
leading
artists
such
poetry
as
distils
assuagement
upon
the
wounded
heart
and
these
priceless
objects
of
art
and
agents
of
mercy
i
am
distributing
at
the
nominal
charge
of
one
dollar
kent
moved
away
his
chin
pressed
down
upon
his
chest
he
went
to
the
office
of
lawyer
adam
bain
and
spent
an
hour
waiting
with
his
feet
propped
up
on
the
desk
when
the
lawyer
entered
kent
remarked
you
rather
put
our
two
official
friends
in
a
hole
this
just
a
mite
maybe
but
they
ve
crawled
out
i
guess
i
spoke
too
how
so
well
if
they
d
gone
ahead
and
buried
the
body
as
it
was
we
could
have
had
it
exhumed
and
then
we
d
have
seen
what
we
d
have
true
enough
and
you
didn
t
see
it
as
it
was
see
what
did
you
kent
s
quiet
smile
sidled
down
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
suppose
he
said
you
give
me
the
fullest
possible
character
sketch
of
our
impulsive
friend
the
half
an
hour
was
consumed
in
this
process
at
the
end
of
the
time
kent
strolled
back
to
the
square
where
simon
groot
had
been
discoursing
there
he
found
the
ornate
wagon
closed
and
its
ornate
proprietor
whistling
over
some
minor
repairs
that
he
had
been
making
an
invitation
to
take
a
ride
in
kent
s
car
was
promptly
accepted
business
first
said
kent
you
re
a
seller
i
m
a
buyer
you
ve
got
some
information
that
i
may
want
if
so
i
m
ready
to
pay
was
any
of
your
talk
true
yep
replied
simon
groot
austerely
it
was
all
true
but
the
will
you
trim
off
the
frills
for
ten
dollars
fair
dealing
for
a
fair
price
is
my
motto
you
ll
find
it
in
gilt
lettering
on
the
back
of
the
wagon
i
what
were
you
doing
on
hawkill
cliffs
sleeping
in
the
and
you
really
met
this
mysterious
wanderer
sure
as
you
re
standing
what
passed
between
you
i
gave
her
good
evening
and
she
spoke
to
me
fair
enough
but
queer
and
said
that
my
children
s
children
might
remember
the
day
now
i
ain
t
got
any
children
to
have
children
so
i
wouldn
t
have
thought
of
it
again
but
for
the
man
that
came
inquiring
after
when
was
that
not
fifteen
minutes
did
you
tell
the
crowd
here
that
yep
i
sold
two
dozen
on
the
strength
and
romance
of
that
point
from
my
description
they
allowed
it
was
a
painter
man
named
sedgwick
i
thought
maybe
i
d
call
in
and
have
him
touch
up
the
wagon
a
bit
where
she
s
and
you
heard
the
woman
cry
out
less
than
an
hour
later
that
s
a
curious
thing
i
d
have
almost
sworn
it
was
a
man
s
voice
that
yelled
it
went
through
me
like
a
sharpened
all
this
was
night
before
last
what
have
you
been
doing
meantime
drove
over
to
marcus
corners
to
trade
yesterday
there
i
heard
about
the
murder
and
came
back
here
to
make
a
little
business
out
of
it
i
ve
done
you
made
no
attempt
to
trace
the
woman
look
here
said
simon
groot
after
a
spell
of
thoughtfulness
your
ten
dollars
is
good
and
you
re
a
gent
all
right
but
i
think
i
ve
talked
a
little
too
much
with
my
mouth
around
here
and
i
m
afraid
they
might
dig
up
this
lady
and
start
something
new
and
want
me
for
a
witness
witnessing
is
bad
for
i
m
safe
said
kent
so
far
so
good
now
would
it
be
worth
five
dollars
to
you
likely
a
relic
of
the
murderer
suggested
the
old
man
quite
mum
s
the
word
then
for
my
part
in
it
that
next
morning
i
followed
her
trail
a
ways
you
see
the
yell
in
the
night
had
got
me
interested
it
was
an
easy
trail
to
follow
for
a
man
that
s
acquainted
in
the
woods
and
i
used
to
be
a
do
a
little
of
it
now
sometimes
she
d
met
somebody
in
a
thicket
i
found
the
string
and
the
paper
of
the
bundle
she
was
carrying
there
then
there
was
a
fight
of
some
sort
for
the
twigs
were
broken
right
to
the
edge
of
the
thicket
and
the
ground
stamped
down
one
or
both
of
em
must
have
broken
out
into
the
open
and
i
lost
the
trail
but
this
is
what
i
found
on
a
hazel
bush
do
i
win
the
five
on
it
kent
s
eyes
drooped
fixing
themselves
on
a
small
object
which
the
other
had
laid
on
his
knee
his
lips
pursed
nothing
that
could
be
interpreted
as
an
answer
came
from
them
simon
groot
waited
with
patience
finally
he
said
that
s
an
awful
pretty
tune
you
re
whistlin
mister
but
sad
and
terrible
long
what
about
the
five
do
we
trade
the
car
came
to
a
stop
digging
into
his
pocket
kent
produced
a
bill
which
he
handed
over
and
still
whistling
the
took
possession
of
simon
groot
s
relic
it
was
an
embroidered
silver
star
with
a
few
torn
wisps
of
cloth
clinging
to
it
chapter
facts
that
contradict
each
other
are
not
facts
pronounced
chester
kent
fumes
of
tobacco
were
rising
from
three
pipes
hovered
about
the
porch
of
the
nook
where
kent
sedgwick
and
lawyer
bain
were
holding
late
council
a
discouraged
observation
from
the
artist
had
elicited
kent
s
epigram
not
all
of
them
anyhow
said
bain
the
chore
in
this
case
is
to
find
facts
enough
to
work
on
the
contrary
declared
kent
facts
in
this
case
are
as
plentiful
as
blackberries
the
trouble
is
that
we
have
no
pail
to
put
them
maybe
we
could
borrow
len
schlager
s
suggested
the
lawyer
dryly
kent
received
this
with
a
subdued
snort
it
is
remarkable
that
the
newspapers
haven
t
sent
men
down
on
such
a
sensational
case
he
said
on
the
contrary
to
you
sir
retorted
bain
so
much
fake
stuff
has
come
out
of
lonesome
cove
that
the
papers
discount
any
news
from
all
the
better
the
only
thing
that
worries
me
more
than
the
stupidity
of
professional
detectives
is
the
shrewdness
of
trained
reporters
at
least
we
can
work
this
out
in
our
own
we
don
t
seem
to
be
getting
much
of
anywhere
complained
sedgwick
complicated
cases
don
t
clear
themselves
up
in
a
day
remarked
kent
in
this
one
we
ve
got
opponents
who
know
more
than
we
schlager
asked
the
lawyer
and
doctor
breed
also
i
think
gansett
jim
what
do
you
think
bain
is
the
mainspring
of
the
sheriff
s
action
money
said
the
lawyer
with
conviction
he
s
as
crooked
as
a
snake
with
the
would
it
require
much
money
to
influence
him
as
much
as
he
could
get
if
the
case
was
in
the
line
of
blackmail
he
d
hold
out
strong
he
s
doctor
breed
must
be
getting
some
of
oh
tim
breed
is
len
s
little
dog
he
takes
orders
of
course
he
ll
take
money
too
if
it
comes
his
way
like
master
like
those
two
said
kent
slowly
know
the
identity
of
the
body
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
they
are
keeping
that
information
to
themselves
those
reasons
we
aren
t
likely
to
find
out
from
murderer
has
bribed
em
opined
bain
possibly
but
that
presupposes
that
the
sheriff
found
something
on
the
body
which
led
him
to
the
murderer
which
isn
t
likely
how
improbable
it
is
that
a
for
argument
that
there
has
been
would
go
as
far
as
to
cover
his
trail
and
the
nature
of
the
crime
by
binding
the
body
on
a
grating
would
overlook
anything
like
a
letter
incriminating
himself
what
did
the
sheriff
find
then
in
the
dead
woman
s
pocket
perhaps
a
handkerchief
with
a
distinctive
and
that
would
lead
him
to
the
identity
of
the
body
presumably
also
to
some
one
we
may
assume
who
was
willing
to
pay
roundly
to
have
that
identity
that
would
naturally
be
the
murderer
wouldn
t
it
asked
sedgwick
no
i
don
t
think
it
looks
to
me
so
said
the
lawyer
he
s
the
one
naturally
interested
in
i
m
almost
ready
to
dismiss
the
notion
of
a
murderer
at
why
so
demanded
both
the
others
because
there
was
no
murder
how
do
you
make
that
out
queried
bain
from
the
nature
of
the
wounds
that
caused
they
look
to
me
to
be
just
such
wounds
as
would
be
made
by
a
blow
with
a
heavy
several
blows
with
a
heavy
club
might
have
caused
such
wounds
but
the
blows
would
have
had
to
be
delivered
peculiarly
a
circle
on
the
skull
six
inches
in
diameter
impinging
on
the
right
ear
is
crushed
in
if
you
can
imagine
a
man
swinging
a
baseball
bat
at
the
height
of
his
shoulder
repeatedly
and
with
great
force
at
the
victim
s
head
you
can
infer
such
a
crushing
in
of
the
bone
my
imagination
hardly
carries
me
so
beating
down
from
above
would
be
the
natural
way
said
bain
certainly
no
such
blow
ever
made
that
then
how
was
it
made
asked
sedgwick
probably
by
a
fall
from
the
cliff
to
the
rocks
and
the
fall
broke
the
manacle
from
the
right
wrist
the
broken
manacle
was
never
on
the
right
that
s
merely
conjecture
said
the
lawyer
no
it
s
certainty
a
blow
heavy
enough
to
break
that
iron
old
as
it
is
must
have
left
a
mark
on
the
flesh
there
was
no
why
should
any
one
put
one
handcuff
on
a
woman
and
leave
the
other
dangling
suppose
the
other
was
not
left
dangling
where
was
it
then
on
the
wrist
of
some
other
person
a
man
had
chained
the
woman
to
himself
said
sedgwick
incredulously
more
probably
the
other
way
that
s
even
more
not
if
you
consider
the
evidence
you
will
remember
that
your
mysterious
visitor
while
talking
with
you
carried
a
heavy
bundle
the
manacles
were
i
infer
in
but
what
conceivable
motive
could
the
dead
woman
have
in
dressing
herself
up
like
a
party
going
to
meet
a
man
and
chaining
him
to
herself
when
you
have
a
bizarre
crime
you
must
look
for
bizarre
motives
just
at
present
i
m
dealing
with
facts
the
iron
was
on
the
left
wrist
of
the
body
therefore
it
was
on
the
right
wrist
of
the
unknown
companion
it
is
natural
to
perform
a
quick
deft
act
like
snapping
on
a
handcuff
with
the
right
hand
hence
presumably
your
visitor
was
the
one
who
clamped
the
and
the
man
broke
off
his
yes
but
only
after
a
struggle
undoubtedly
if
i
could
find
a
man
with
a
badly
bruised
right
wrist
i
should
consider
the
trail
s
end
in
sight
you
ll
make
inquiries
will
you
bain
i
will
and
i
ll
keep
an
eye
on
len
schlager
and
the
doc
anything
more
now
if
not
i
ll
say
good
after
the
lawyer
had
made
his
way
into
the
darkness
kent
turned
to
his
host
this
affair
is
really
becoming
a
very
pretty
problem
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
of
your
meeting
with
simon
groot
who
the
patriarch
in
the
circus
oh
i
d
forgotten
why
when
i
was
trying
to
trail
the
woman
i
chanced
upon
him
and
asked
if
he
had
seen
her
he
hadn
he
had
also
he
heard
a
terrified
cry
shortly
after
the
cry
he
thought
was
in
a
man
s
voice
simon
groot
isn
t
wholly
lacking
in
sense
of
a
man
s
voice
in
a
cry
what
could
that
mean
oh
any
one
of
several
hundred
unthinkable
things
said
kent
patiently
wait
she
must
have
attacked
some
other
man
as
she
did
me
she
was
going
to
a
rendezvous
wasn
t
she
then
she
and
the
man
she
went
to
meet
quarreled
and
he
killed
her
by
throwing
her
over
the
and
the
handcuffs
sedgwick
s
hands
went
to
his
head
that
of
course
is
the
inexplicable
thing
but
don
t
you
think
that
was
the
way
she
met
her
death
then
what
do
you
think
never
mind
that
at
present
the
point
is
that
simon
groot
naturally
supposed
you
to
have
been
mixed
up
in
whatever
tragedy
there
was
going
you
ve
an
unfortunate
knack
of
manufacturing
evidence
against
yourself
sedgwick
the
redeeming
feature
is
that
the
sheriff
can
t
very
well
use
it
to
arrest
i
don
t
see
kent
chuckled
don
t
you
see
that
the
last
thing
the
sheriff
wants
to
do
is
arrest
anybody
no
i
don
why
he
has
the
body
safely
buried
now
you
ll
remember
that
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
it
buried
identification
is
what
he
dreaded
danger
of
identification
is
now
over
if
any
one
should
be
arrested
the
body
would
be
exhumed
and
the
danger
would
return
in
aggravated
form
no
he
wants
you
suspected
not
he
is
certainly
getting
his
wish
for
the
present
well
i
m
why
don
t
you
move
your
things
from
the
hotel
and
stay
here
with
me
suggested
sedgwick
getting
nervous
inquired
kent
it
isn
t
that
but
i
think
i
could
make
you
more
kent
shook
his
head
thank
you
but
i
don
t
believe
i
d
better
when
i
m
at
work
on
a
case
i
need
and
so
you
stick
to
a
public
hotel
queer
notions
you
have
of
not
at
all
a

is
absolutely
mine
to
do
with
as
i
please
as
long
as
i
pay
my
bills
i
m
among
strangers
i
m
not
interfered
with
no
house
not
even
a
man
s
own
can
possibly
be
so
private
as
a
strange
perhaps
you
re
right
admitted
the
other
with
a
laugh
then
lapsing
into
pronounced
gloom
for
the
first
time
he
said
it
seems
pretty
tough
that
i
should
be
in
all
this
coil
and
tangle
because
a
crazy
woman
happened
by
merest
chance
to
make
a
call
on
kent
s
pipe
glowed
in
the
darkness
and
silence
before
he
replied
then
he
delivered
himself
as
follows
sedgwick
try
to
forget
if
you
can
that
stuff
about
the
crazy
woman
forget
it
how
should
i
why
should
i
because
you
re
absolutely
on
the
wrong
track
good
slowly
kent
climbed
the
road
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
then
stopped
and
looked
back
into
the
studio
which
had
sprung
into
light
as
soon
as
he
left
sedgwick
s
figure
loomed
tall
and
spare
in
the
radiance
the
artist
was
standing
before
his
easel
looking
down
at
it
fixedly
kent
knew
what
it
was
that
he
gazed
on
and
as
the
lovely
wistful
rose
in
his
memory
he
sighed
a
little
i
mustn
t
forget
that
quest
he
said
poor
old
sedgwick
but
once
in
his
room
the
picture
faded
and
there
came
before
his
groping
mental
vision
instead
the
spectacle
of
two
dark
figures
chained
together
and
battling
the
one
for
life
the
other
for
some
mysterious
elusive
motive
that
fluttered
at
the
portals
of
his
comprehension
like
a
melody
and
the
second
struggling
figure
whose
face
was
hidden
flashed
in
the
moonlight
with
the
sheen
of
silver
stars
against
black

turning
aside
just
before
it
gains
the
turnpike
to
the
eyrie
hotel
to
evade
a
stretch
of
marsh
travels
on
wooden
stilts
across
a
deep
clear
pool
fed
by
a
spring
signs
at

end
of

traversing

faster
than
a
walk
now
the
measure
of
a
walk
for
an
automobile
is
dubious
but
the
most
rigorous
constable
could
have
found
no
basis
for
protest
in
the
pace
maintained
by
a
light
electric
car
carrying
a
short
slender
elderly
man
who
peered
out
with
weary
eyes
into
the
glory
of
the
july
sunshine
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
the
car
stopped
to
allow
its
occupant
a
better
view
of
a
figure
prostrate
on
the
brink
of
the
pool
presently
the
figure
came
to
the
posture
of
all
fours
the
face
turned
upward
and
the
motorist
caught
the
glint
of
a
monocle
then
the
face
turned
again
to
its
quest
are
you
looking
for
something
lost
asked
the
man
in
the
car
yes
was
the
reply
very
much
when
did
you
lose
it
if
it
s
not
an
impertinent
question
not
in
the
least
answered
the
other
cordially
i
didn
t
lose
it
at
ah
the
motorist
smiled
when
was
it
lost
then
across
the
monocled
face
passed
a
shadow
of
thoughtful
consideration
about
four
million
years
ago
i
should
and
you
are
still
looking
i
perceive
that
you
are
an
optimist
said
the
elderly
man
just
at
present
i
m
a
pardon
me
a
limnologist
limnology
is
the
science
of
the
life
found
on
the
banks
of
small
bodies
of
water
it
is
a
fascinating
study
i
assure
you
there
is
only
one
chair
of
limnology
in
the
and
you
i
presume
are
the
incumbent
asked
the
other
politely
no
indeed
the
merest
amateur
on
the
contrary
i
m
humbly
hoping
to
discover
the
eggs
of
certain
neuropterous
insects
we
know
the
insects
and
we
know
they
lay
eggs
but
how
they
conceal
them
has
been
a
secret
since
the
first
rose
from
the
first
ah
you
are
an
entomologist
to
some
so
was
i
i
had
more
time
business
has
drawn
my
attention
though
never
my
interest
away
from
it
i
ve
entirely
dropped
my
reading
in
the
last
year
by
the
way
were
you
here
in
time
to
witness
the
swarm
of
last
month
rather
unusual
i
no
i
missed
that
what
was
the
feature
specially
the
suddenness
of
the
appearance
you
know
helmund
says
pardon
me
who
helmund
the
oh
yes
certainly
go
on
the
stranger
went
on
at
some
length
he
appeared
to
be
an
interested
rather
than
a
learned
student
of
the
subject
as
he
talked
sitting
on
the
step
of
his
car
from
which
he
had
descended
the
other
studied
him
his
quiet
but
forceful
voice
his
severely
handsome
face
with
its
high
brows
harsh
nose
and
chiseled
outlines
from
which
the
eyes
looked
forth
thoughtful
alert
yet
with
the
gaze
of
a
man
in
pain
presently
he
said
courteously
if
you
are
going
back
to
the
hotel
may
i
take
you
along
i
am
alexander
thank
you
i
ll
be
glad
of
a
lift
my
name
is
chester
not
the
professor
kent
of
the
ramsay
case
the
same
you
know
blair
i
ve
always
believed
that
you
had
more
of
a
hand
in
ramsay
s
death
than
i
now
if
you
wish
to
withdraw
your
offer
of
a
not
at
all
a
man
who
has
been
so
abused
by
the
newspapers
as
i
can
stand
a
little
plain
speaking
for
all
that
on
my
word
professor
kent
i
had
no
hand
in
sending
ramsay
on
that
dirty
business
of
the
scientist
considered
him
thoughtfully
well
i
believe
you
said
he
shortly
and
got
into
the
machine
this
meeting
is
a
fortunate
chance
for
me
said
blair
presently
chance
murmured
kent
interrogatively
the
car
swerved
sharply
but
immediately
resumed
the
middle
of
the
road
certainly
chance
said
the
motorist
what
else
should
it
be
of
course
agreed
kent
as
you
i
said
fortunate
continued
the
other
because
you
are
i
believe
the
very
man
i
want
there
is
an
affair
that
has
been
troubling
me
a
good
deal
i
haven
t
been
able
to
look
into
it
personally
because
of
the
serious
illness
of
my
son
who
is
at
my
place
on
sundayman
s
creek
but
it
is
in
your
line
being
entomological
and
perhaps
what
is
it
asked
kent
an
inexplicable
destruction
of
our
stored
woolens
by
the
clothes
moth
you
may
perhaps
know
that
i
am
president
of
the
kinsella
mills
we
ve
been
having
a
great
deal
of
trouble
this
spring
and
our
superintendent
believes
that
some
enemy
is
introducing
the
pest
into
our
warehouses
will
you
take
the
case
when
start
for
chester
kent
s
long
fingers
went
to
the
lobe
on
his
ear
give
me
until
three
o
clock
this
afternoon
to
consider
can
i
reach
you
by
telephone
yes
at
hedgerow
house
my
that
is
how
far
from
here
fourteen
miles
but
you
need
not
come
there
i
could
return
to
the
hotel
to
conclude
arrangements
and
i
think
he
added
significantly
that
you
would
find
the
project
a
profitable
doubtless
are
you
well
acquainted
with
this
part
of
the
country
blair
yes
i
ve
been
coming
here
for
is
there
an
army
post
near
by
not
within
a
hundred
nor
any
officers
on
special
detail
about
none
so
far
as
i
kent
produced
from
his
pocket
the
silver
star
with
the
shred
of
cloth
hanging
to
it
this
may
or
may
not
be
an
important
clue
to
a
curious
death
that
occurred
here
three
days
yes
i
ve
heard
something
of
it
said
the
other
indifferently
i
took
it
to
be
mostly
before
the
death
there
was
a
struggle
this
star
was
found
at
the
scene
of
the
it
looks
like
the
star
from
the
collar
of
an
officer
i
should
say
positively
that
it
was
from
an
army
or
navy
positiveness
is
the
greatest
temptation
and
snare
that
i
have
to
fight
against
remarked
chester
kent
otherwise
i
should
say
positively
that
no
officer
going
to
a
dubious
rendezvous
would
wear
a
uniform
which
would
be
certain
to
make
him
conspicuous
are
you
yourself
an
expert
in
woolen
fabrics
blair
i
have
could
you
tell
from
that
tiny
fragment
whether
or
not
the
whole
cloth
is
all
wool
without
replying
blair
gave
the
steering
handle
a
quick
sweep
and
the
car
drew
up
before
a
drug
store
he
took
the
star
and
was
gone
a
few
minutes
not
all
wool
he
announced
on
his
return
exit
the
army
or
navy
officer
remarked
kent
why
so
because
regulations
require
get
them
what
is
the
fabric
a
fairly
good
mixture
from
the
very
elemental
chemical
test
i
made
something
in
the
nature
of
a
worsted
batiste
i
should
judge
from
what
i
could
make
out
under
the
inferior
that
they
loaned
thank
you
blair
you
ve
eliminated
one
troublesome
hypothesis
for
me
i
ll
telephone
you
before
three
o
clock
good
from
the
woolen
manufacturer
chester
kent
went
direct
to
the
martindale
center
library
where
he
interviewed
the
librarian
do
you
get
the
agriculture
department
publications
have
you
a
pamphlet
issued
by
the
bureau
of
entomology
helmund
on
swarm
phenomenon
in
yes
sir
it
was
inquired
for
only
yesterday
by
ah
yes
he
s
quite
interested
in
the
subject
i
it
must
be
quite
recent
then
said
the
librarian
we
haven
t
seen
him
here
for
a
long
time
until
two
days
ago
when
he
came
and
put
in
a
morning
reading
on
so
alexander
blair
said
kent
addressing
the
last
fence
post
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
after
a
thoughtful
walk
that
was
a
fatal
break
on
your
part
that
mention
of
helmund
amateurs
who
have
wholly
dropped
a
subject
since
years
back
don
t
usually
know
publications
issued
only
within
three
months
that
casual
meeting
with
me
was
well
carried
out
and
you
called
it
chance
a
very
palpably
manufactured
chance
but
why
am
i
worth
so
much
trouble
to
know
and
why
does
alexander
blair
leave
a
desperately
ill
son
to
arrange
an
errand
for
me
at
this
particular
time
and
is
hedgerow
house
fourteen
miles
distant
and
possessing
just
such
an
electric
car
as
a
woman
would
use
in
driving
round
the
country
perhaps
the
place
whence
came
sedgwick
s
sweet
lady
of
mystery
finally
what
connection
has
all
this
with
the
body
lying
in
annalaka
eliciting
no
reply
from
the
fence
post
kent
returned
to
the
eyrie
called
up
hedgerow
house
and
declined
blair
s
proposition
early
that
evening
francis
sedgwick
came
to
the
hotel
the
clerk
at
first
negligent
pricked
up
his
ears
and
exhibited
unmistakable
signs
of
human
interest
when
he
heard
the
name
for
the
suspicion
attaching
to
the
artist
had
spread
swiftly
moreover
the
caller
was
in
a
state
of
hardly
repressed
excitement
mr
kent
i
m
afraid
you
can
t
see
him
sir
he
isn
t
in
his
isn
t
he
about
the
hotel
the
clerk
hesitated
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
sir
for
it
s
kent
s
strict
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
but
he
s
in
his
special
room
is
it
anything
very
important
any
new
evidence
or
something
of
that
sort
that
is
what
i
want
kent
to
in
that
case
i
might
take
the
responsibility
but
i
think
i
had
better
take
you
to
him
after
the
elevator
had
carried
them
to
the
top
of
its
run
they
mounted
a
flight
of
stairs
and
walked
to
a
far
corner
of
the
building
nobody
s
been
in
here
since
he
took
it
explained
the
clerk
as
they
walked
turned
all
the
furniture
out
special
lock
on
the
door
some
kind
of
scientific
experiments
i
suppose
he
s
very
quiet
about
having
reached
the
door
he
discreetly
tapped
no
answer
came
somewhat
less
timidity
characterized
his
next
effort
a
growl
of
surpassing
savagery
from
within
was
his
reward
you
see
sedgwick
said
the
clerk
raising
his
voice
he
called
mr
kent
i
ve
get
away
and
go
to
the
devil
cried
a
voice
from
inside
in
fury
what
do
you
mean
it
s
i
kent
sedgwick
i
ve
got
to
see
there
was
a
silence
of
some
seconds
what
do
you
want
asked
kent
at
length
you
told
me
to
come
at
once
if
anything
turned
so
i
did
sighed
kent
well
chase
that
infernal
to
the
stairs
and
i
ll
let
you
with
a
wry
face
the
clerk
retired
kent
opened
the
door
and
his
friend
squeezed
through
into
a
bare
room
the
walls
were
hung
and
the
floor
was
carpeted
with
white
sheets
there
was
no
furniture
of
any
kind
unless
a
narrow
mattress
in
one
corner
could
be
so
reckoned
beside
the
mattress
lay
a
small
pad
and
a
pencil
only
on
the
visitor
s
subconscious
self
did
these
peculiarities
impress
themselves
such
was
his
absorption
in
his
own
interests
it
s
happened
he
announced
has
it
said
kent
lean
up
against
the
wall
and
make
yourself
at
home
man
you
re
shaking
you
d
shake
too
retorted
the
artist
his
voice
trembling
no
anger
doesn
t
affect
me
that
way
wait
now
don
t
tell
me
yet
if
i
m
to
have
a
report
it
must
be
from
a
sane
man
not
from
one
in
a
blind
fury
take
time
and
cool
down
what
do
you
think
of
my
room
it
looks
like
the
abode
of
white
silence
have
you
turned
trappist
monk
not
such
a
bad
guess
this
is
the
retreat
of
my
mind
i
think
against
the
blank
what
s
the
game
asked
sedgwick
interested
in
spite
of
himself
it
dates
back
to
our
college
days
do
you
remember
that
queer
freshman
berwind
the
yes
the
poor
chap
went
insane
yes
it
was
a
weak
mind
but
a
singularly
receptive
one
you
know
we
used
to
force
numbers
or
upon
his
consciousness
by
merely
thinking
of
i
recollect
his
method
was
to
stand
gazing
at
a
blank
wall
he
said
the
object
we
were
thinking
of
would
rise
before
him
visually
against
the
blankness
did
you
ever
figure
out
how
he
managed
to
do
it
not
exactly
but
his
notion
of
keeping
the
mind
blank
for
impressions
has
its
points
if
you
throw
off
the
clutch
of
the
brain
as
it
were
and
let
it
work
along
its
own
lines
it
sometimes
arranges
and
formulates
ideas
that
you
wouldn
t
get
from
it
under
sort
of
in
a
sense
for
years
i
ve
kept
a
bare
white
room
in
my
washington
house
to
do
my
hard
thinking
in
when
your
affair
promised
to
become
difficult
for
me
i
rigged
up
this
spot
and
i
m
trying
to
see
things
against
the
any
particular
kind
of
things
kent
produced
the
silver
star
from
his
pocket
and
told
of
its
discovery
the
stars
in
their
courses
may
have
fought
against
sisera
he
remarked
but
they
aren
t
going
out
of
their
way
to
kent
s
jaw
was
sagging
down
his
lean
fingers
pulled
savagely
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
the
stars
in
their
their
s
it
he
half
whispered
sedgwick
was
it
your
visitor
said
to
you
about
jupiter
she
didn
t
mention
no
of
course
not
not
by
name
but
what
was
it
she
said
about
the
planet
that
she
pointed
out
over
the
sea
oh
was
that
jupiter
how
did
you
know
looked
last
night
of
course
said
kent
impatiently
there
s
no
other
planet
conspicuous
over
the
sea
at
that
hour
from
where
you
stood
that
s
not
important
at
least
not
now
what
did
she
say
oh
some
rot
about
daring
to
follow
her
star
and
find
happiness
and
that
perhaps
it
might
lead
me
to
glory
or
a
kind
of
snort
came
from
kent
where
have
my
brains
been
he
cried
he
thrust
the
bit
of
embroidery
back
into
his
pocket
then
with
an
abrupt
change
of
tone
well
is
your
temper
in
hand
for
the
tell
me
about
it
you
remember
picture
of
the
face
said
sedgwick
with
an
effort
nobody
would
easily
forget
i
ve
been
doing
another
portrait
from
the
sketches
it
was
on
opaque
glass
an
experimental
medium
that
i
ve
worked
on
some
late
this
afternoon
i
went
out
leaving
the
glass
sheet
backed
against
a
light
board
on
my
easel
the
door
was
locked
with
a
heavy
spring
there
s
no
possible
access
by
the
window
yet
somebody
came
in
and
smashed
my
picture
to
fragments
if
i
can
find
that
man
kent
i
ll
kill
him
kent
glanced
at
the
artist
s
long
strong
hands
they
were
clenched
on
his
knees
the
fingers
were
bloodless
i
believe
you
would
said
the
scientist
with
conviction
you
mustn
t
you
know
no
luxuries
at
don
t
joke
with
me
about
this
very
good
but
just
consider
please
that
i
m
having
enough
trouble
clearing
you
of
a
supposed
murder
of
your
doing
to
want
a
real
one
however
provoked
on
my
keep
the
man
out
of
my
way
that
depends
anything
else
in
your
place
damaged
not
that
i
noticed
but
i
didn
t
pay
much
attention
to
anything
else
i
came
here
direct
to
find
that
s
right
well
i
m
with
you
for
the
locking
his
curious
room
after
him
kent
led
the
way
to
the
hotel
lobby
where
he
stopped
only
long
enough
to
send
some
telegrams
the
sun
was
still
a
few
minutes
short
of
its
setting
when
he
and
his
companion
emerged
from
the
hotel
kent
at
once
broke
into
a
trot
chapter
invasion
such
ruin
as
had
been
wrought
in
sedgwick
s
studio
was
strictly
localized
the
easel
lay
on
the
floor
with
its
rear
leg
crumpled
around
it
were
scattered
the
fragments
of
the
glass
upon
which
the
painter
had
set
his
labor
of
love
a
high
chair
faced
the
wreckage
on
its
peak
was
hung
a
traveling
cap
lopping
across
the
back
sprawled
a
norfolk
jacket
belonging
to
sedgwick
chester
kent
lifted
the
coat
and
after
a
swift
survey
let
it
drop
did
you
leave
that
there
he
asked
i
hung
it
across
the
back
of
the
chair
answered
sedgwick
north
window
closed
yes
as
you
see
it
and
west
one
open
nothing
has
been
changed
i
tell
you
except
sedgwick
s
hand
outstretched
toward
the
destroyed
portrait
condensed
itself
involuntarily
into
a
knotty
fist
the
lock
of
the
door
hasn
t
been
tampered
with
said
kent
as
for
this
open
window
he
leaned
out
looking
around
any
man
gaining
access
here
must
have
used
a
ladder
which
is
unlikely
in
broad
how
about
a
for
the
door
there
s
a
simpler
solution
nearer
at
hand
i
fancy
you
didn
t
chance
to
notice
that
things
have
happened
to
the
coat
as
well
as
to
the
then
the
invader
went
through
the
coat
and
not
finding
what
he
was
looking
for
smashed
my
picture
cried
sedgwick
through
the
coat
certainly
agreed
kent
with
his
quiet
smile
now
hang
it
across
the
chair
back
just
as
it
was
sedgwick
took
the
norfolk
jacket
from
him
why
there
s
a
hole
through
it
he
exclaimed
exactly
the
path
of
the
a
bullet
right
again
instead
of
murdering
as
you
pine
to
do
you
ve
been
murdered
that
the
picture
was
destroyed
is
merely
a
bit
of
ill
fortune
that
you
weren
t
inside
the
coat
when
the
bullet
went
through
it
and
cut
the
prop
from
your
easel
is
a
bit
of
the
other
kind
hang
up
the
coat
sedgwick
obeyed
there
said
kent
viewing
the
result
from
the
window
at
a
distance
of
say
a
quarter
of
a
mile
that
arrangement
of
coat
and
cap
would
look
uncommonly
like
a
man
sitting
in
a
chair
before
his
work
at
least
i
should
think
so
and
yonder
thicket
on
the
hillside
he
added
looking
out
of
the
window
again
is
just
about
that
distance
and
seems
to
be
the
only
spot
in
sight
giving
a
straight
range
suppose
we
run
up
sound
as
was
his
condition
sedgwick
was
panting
when
he
brought
up
at
the
spot
some
yards
behind
his
leader
as
the
scientist
had
surmised
the
arrangement
of
coat
and
cap
in
the
studio
presented
at
that
distance
an
excellent
simulacrum
of
the
rear
view
of
a
man
lounging
in
a
chair
bidding
the
artist
stay
outside
the
copse
kent
entered
on
hands
and
knees
and
made
extended
exploration
after
a
few
moments
the
sound
of
low
lugubrious
whistling
was
heard
from
the
trees
and
presently
the
musician
emerged
leading
himself
by
the
lobe
of
his
ear
evidently
you
ve
found
something
commented
sedgwick
who
had
begun
to
comprehend
his
friend
s
peculiar
methods
of
expression
then
why
are
you
so
pleased
with
yourself
that
is
because
you
ve
found
nothing
it
seems
an
easy
system
observed
the
artist
sarcastically
so
it
is
to
a
reasoning
being
i
m
satisfied
that
some
one
fired
a
shot
from
here
the
good
you
as
he
supposed
jerk
to
the
shot
as
if
with
a
bullet
through
you
and
went
away
leaving
no
trace
behind
him
added
sedgwick
no
trace
that
is
tangible
therein
lies
the
of
course
you
don
t
expect
me
to
follow
why
not
look
at
the
ground
in
the
what
is
there
to
be
seen
there
since
you
ve
said
there
are
no
marks
the
soil
is
very
yes
there
s
a
spring
just
back
of
yet
there
s
not
a
footprint
discernible
on
i
ve
got
that
part
of
the
lesson
by
heart
i
use
your
brain
on
it
then
some
one
designing
to
make
you
his
target
has
been
in
this
thicket
been
and
gone
and
left
the
place
trackless
that
some
one
was
a
keen
woodsman
putting
it
in
words
of
one
syllable
i
should
say
he
probably
had
the
racial
instinct
of
the
hunt
does
that
flush
any
idea
from
the
deep
and
devious
coverts
of
your
brain
racial
instinct
gansett
jim
said
sedgwick
exactly
if
i
had
found
tracks
all
over
the
place
i
should
have
known
it
wasn
t
he
finding
nothing
i
was
naturally
that
s
more
than
i
am
retorted
the
other
i
suppose
he
s
likely
to
resume
his
gunnery
at
any
unless
we
can
discourage
i
expect
we
by
having
him
arrested
difficulties
might
be
put
in
our
way
sheriff
len
schlager
and
the
are
in
some
sort
of
loose
partnership
in
this
affair
as
you
know
gansett
jim
honestly
thinks
that
you
had
a
hand
in
the
lonesome
cove
murder
as
he
believes
it
to
be
it
isn
t
impossible
that
the
sheriff
has
subtly
egged
him
on
to
kill
you
in
why
does
the
sheriff
want
me
killed
nothing
personal
i
assure
you
answered
kent
with
mock
courtesy
i
ve
already
explained
that
he
will
not
arrest
you
but
you
re
the
suspect
and
if
you
were
put
out
of
the
way
every
one
would
believe
you
the
murderer
there
would
be
a
perfunctory
investigation
the
whole
thing
would
be
hushed
up
and
the
body
in
annalaka
churchyard
would
rest
in
a
profitable
peace
for
the
flat
out
kent
do
you
know
who
the
dead
woman
is
flat
out
i
don
t
but
i
ve
a
shrewd
guess
that
i
ll
find
out
before
from
gansett
jim
no
hope
there
he
s
an
indian
what
i
m
going
to
see
him
about
now
is
your
now
where
do
you
expect
to
find
him
in
the
village
i
hope
it
wouldn
t
do
for
you
to
come
there
but
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
spot
where
you
met
the
man
and
wait
until
i
bring
it
was
a
long
wait
for
the
worried
artist
in
the
deep
forest
that
bounded
the
lonely
road
along
hawkill
heights
ten
o
clock
had
chimed
across
the
hill
from
the
distant
village
when
he
heard
footsteps
and
at
a
call
from
kent
stepped
out
into
the
clear
holding
the
lantern
above
him
the
light
showed
a
strange
spectacle
kent
watchful
keen
ready
as
a
cat
to
spring
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
distorted
face
of
the
terror
rage
overmastering
amazement
and
the
of
the
supernatural
glared
from
the
eyeballs
of
the
negro
but
the
jaw
and
chin
were
set
firm
in
the
stoicism
of
the
indian
in
that
strange
racial
conflict
of
emotions
the
fiercer
finer
strain
won
gansett
jim
s
frame
relaxed
he
grunted
good
boy
jim
chester
kent
s
voice
at
the
s
ear
was
the
voice
of
one
who
soothes
an
affrighted
horse
i
didn
t
know
whether
you
could
stand
it
or
not
you
see
you
didn
t
shoot
sedgwick
after
dun
no
what
you
mean
grunted
gansett
jim
and
you
mustn
t
shoot
at
him
any
more
continued
the
scientist
the
tone
was
soft
as
a
woman
s
but
sedgwick
felt
in
it
the
tensity
of
a
man
ready
for
any
extreme
perhaps
the
too
felt
the
peril
of
that
determination
for
he
hung
his
head
i
ve
brought
you
here
to
show
you
why
pay
good
heed
now
a
man
traveling
in
a
wagon
was
met
here
as
he
says
by
a
questioned
him
and
then
went
on
he
followed
the
trail
through
the
brush
and
found
the
signs
of
a
fight
the
fight
took
place
before
the
death
here
s
the
lantern
take
his
trail
from
without
a
word
the
snatched
the
light
and
plunged
into
a
after
a
few
minutes
of
swift
going
he
pulled
up
short
in
an
open
copse
of
ash
and
set
the
lantern
on
the
ground
he
nosed
about
the
trodden
earth
suddenly
he
darted
across
and
seizing
sedgwick
s
ankle
lifted
his
foot
almost
throwing
him
from
his
balance
sedgwick
wrenched
himself
free
and
with
a
swinging
blow
into
which
he
put
all
the
energy
of
his
repressed
wrath
knocked
the
flat
hands
off
damn
you
he
growled
gansett
jim
got
to
his
feet
a
little
unsteadily
expectant
of
a
rush
his
assailant
stood
with
weight
thrown
forward
but
the
other
made
no
slightest
attempt
at
reprisal
catching
up
the
lantern
which
had
rolled
from
his
hand
he
threw
its
light
upon
sedgwick
s
forward
foot
then
he
turned
away
kent
whistled
softly
the
whistle
had
a
purring
quality
of
content
not
the
same
as
the
footprint
eh
he
remarked
footprint
too
small
grunted
gansett
jim
how
many
people
two
illustration
see
you
didn
t
shoot
sedgwick
after
three
of
course
i
had
forgotten
the
man
he
came
later
but
jim
you
see
it
wasn
t
what
he
follow
for
demanded
the
other
savagely
no
evil
purpose
you
can
take
his
trail
from
the
circus
wagon
and
follow
that
if
you
want
to
satisfy
yourself
further
that
he
wasn
t
here
i
ll
let
you
have
the
lantern
only
remember
now
no
more
shooting
at
the
wrong
man
the
made
no
reply
and
you
sedgwick
here
s
the
destroyer
do
you
still
want
to
kill
him
i
suppose
not
replied
the
artist
lifelessly
since
his
design
was
only
against
your
life
and
not
against
your
picture
commented
kent
with
a
smile
well
our
night
s
work
is
lifting
the
lantern
he
held
it
in
the
face
of
the
jim
huh
when
you
really
want
to
know
who
made
those
footprints
come
and
tell
me
who
the
body
in
annalaka
is
a
trade
for
a
trade
you
understand
the
eyes
stared
immovable
the
chin
did
not
quiver
reaching
for
the
lantern
gansett
jim
now
nine
of
indian
to
one
of
negro
turned
away
from
them
to
the
pathway
no
he
said
stolidly
as
the
flicker
of
radiance
danced
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
sedgwick
spoke
well
do
you
consider
that
we
ve
made
a
friend
no
answered
chester
kent
but
we
ve
done
what
s
as
good
we
ve
quashed
an
chapter
house
answers
to
the
telegrams
chester
kent
had
despatched
arrived
in
the
form
of
night
letters
bringing
information
regarding
the
blairs
of
hedgerow
house
not
sufficient
information
to
satisfy
the
seeker
however
therefore
having
digested
their
contents
at
breakfast
the
scientist
cast
about
him
to
supply
the
deficiency
the
feet
of
hope
led
him
to
the
shop
of
elder
ira
dennett
besides
being
an
able
plumber
and
tinker
elder
dennett
performed
by
vocation
the
pleasurable
duties
of
unprinted
journalism
that
is
to
say
he
was
the
semiofficial
town
gossip
as
professor
kent
was
a
conspicuous
figure
in
the
choicest
titbit
the
elder
had
acquired
in
stock
for
many
years
and
as
the
elder
had
been
unable
to
come
to
speech
with
him
since
the
inquest
kent
had
achieved
some
skilful
dodging
there
was
joy
in
the
s
heart
over
the
visit
unhappily
it
appeared
that
kent
was
there
strictly
on
business
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
of
the
mystery
of
lonesome
cove
he
wished
his
acetylene
lamp
fixed
at
once
if
elder
dennett
pleased
glum
was
the
face
of
the
elder
as
he
examined
the
lamp
which
needed
very
little
attention
it
lightened
when
his
visitor
observed
i
ve
been
thinking
a
little
of
getting
an
electric
car
to
run
about
here
in
there
was
a
neat
little
one
in
town
old
blair
s
replied
dennett
i
seen
you
in
it
known
blair
long
he
offered
me
a
lift
into
town
very
kindly
he
was
a
stranger
to
me
said
kent
truthfully
and
with
intent
to
deceive
who
did
you
say
he
was
gosh
sakes
don
t
you
know
who
aleck
blair
is
blair
blair
said
kent
innocently
is
he
the
author
of
blair
s
of
elder
dennett
snorted
he
s
a
millionaire
that
s
what
he
is
ain
t
you
read
about
him
in
the
fabric
trust
investigations
oh
that
blair
yes
i
believe
i
kent
yawned
it
was
a
bit
of
strategy
and
met
with
deserved
success
regarding
that
yawn
as
a
challenge
to
his
vocational
powers
the
elder
set
about
eliminating
the
inhuman
indifference
of
which
it
was
the
expression
floods
of
information
poured
from
his
eager
mouth
he
traced
the
history
of
the
blairs
in
and
out
of
concentric
circles
of
scandal
financial
political
mostly
untrue
those
in
which
the
greatest
proportion
of
truth
inhered
dealt
with
the
escapades
of
wilfrid
blair
the
only
son
and
heir
of
the
household
who
had
burned
up
all
the
paternal
money
he
could
lay
hands
on
writing
his
name
in
red
fire
across
the
night
life
of
london
paris
and
new
york
tiring
of
this
he
had
come
home
and
married
a
girl
of
nineteen
beautiful
and
innocent
whose
parents
the
elder
piously
opined
had
sold
her
to
the
devil
per
blair
agent
the
girl
whose
maiden
name
was
marjorie
s
fingers
went
to
his
ear
at
left
blair
after
a
year
of
marriage
though
there
was
no
legal
process
and
he
had
returned
to
his
haunts
of
the
gutter
until
retribution
overtook
him
in
the
form
of
tuberculosis
his
father
had
brought
him
to
their
place
on
sundayman
s
creek
and
there
he
was
kept
in
visited
from
time
to
time
by
his
young
wife
who
helped
to
care
for
him
that
s
the
story
they
tell
commented
the
elder
but
some
folks
has
got
it
s
a
prevalent
complaint
murmured
kent
and
highly
dennett
stared
my
own
suspicions
he
proceeded
firmly
is
that
the
young
feller
hasn
t
got
no
more
consumption
than
you
have
i
think
old
blair
has
got
him
here
to
keep
him
out
of
the
publicity
is
not
to
blair
s
taste
then
not
s
no
word
for
it
declared
the
human
bureau
of
information
delighted
at
this
evidence
of
dawning
interest
on
the
part
of
his
hearer
he
s
crazy
against
it
they
says
he
pays
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
let
young
blair
s
name
alone
i
don
t
believe
the
old
man
would
hardly
stop
short
of
murder
to
keep
his
name
out
of
print
he
s
kind
o
loony
on
the
you
ve
been
to
his
country
place
only
wunst
mostly
they
have
one
o
them
scientific
plumber
fellers
from
the
elder
s
tone
was
as
essence
of
gall
and
wormwood
wunst
i
had
a
job
there
though
an
i
seen
young
blair
moonin
around
the
grounds
with
a
man
quite
a
place
i
hear
suggested
kent
sailor
milt
smith
is
the
feller
that
can
tell
you
about
the
place
as
it
used
to
be
here
he
comes
up
the
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
door
and
called
sailor
smith
sturdy
and
white
entered
and
greeted
kent
courteously
mr
dennett
was
saying
remarked
kent
that
you
know
something
of
the
history
of
hedgerow
house
as
i
believe
they
call
they
call
it
repeated
the
old
sailor
who
calls
it
if
you
mean
the
blair
place
that
s
hogg
s
haven
that
is
you
can
t
wipe
out
that
name
while
there
s
a
man
living
as
knew
the
place
at
its
worst
old
captain
hogg
built
it
and
lived
in
it
and
died
in
it
and
if
there
s
a
fryin
in
hell
the
devil
is
fryin
bacon
out
of
old
hogg
for
the
things
he
done
in
that
how
long
since
did
he
die
oh
twenty
year
and
the
house
was
sold
soon
after
stood
vacant
for
ten
years
then
this
rich
feller
blair
bought
it
i
don
t
know
him
but
he
bought
a
weevilly
biscuit
there
a
bad
house
it
bad
what
s
wrong
with
it
men
s
bones
in
the
brick
and
women
s
blood
in
the
was
the
old
boy
a
cannibal
asked
kent
amused
by
the
sea
veteran
s
heroics
just
as
bad
have
you
ever
been
in
the
house
many
s
the
time
when
it
was
hogg
s
haven
only
once
since
they
do
tell
that
the
curse
has
come
down
with
the
house
and
is
heavy
on
the
new
owner
s
so
i
ve
the
old
white
head
wagged
bodingly
the
curse
of
the
blood
he
said
it
s
on
all
that
but
that
wouldn
t
affect
the
not
aleck
blair
but
the
how
so
didn
t
you
know
there
was
the
same
strain
in
young
wilfrid
blair
as
there
was
in
old
captain
hogg
hogg
s
oldest
sister
was
the
grandmother
of
this
young
feller
s
mother
wasn
t
she
put
in
elder
dennett
that
s
right
wilfrid
blair
s
great
and
a
bad
un
too
i
guess
continued
the
elder
relishingly
don
t
you
say
it
cried
the
old
seaman
the
curse
of
the
blood
was
on
her
strange
she
was
and
beautiful
so
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
but
not
bad
she
came
in
at
lonesome
cove
drowned
at
sea
asked
kent
they
never
knew
one
day
she
was
gone
the
next
night
her
body
came
in
they
said
in
the
countryside
that
she
had
the
gift
of
second
sight
and
foretold
her
own
mused
kent
and
now
the
blairs
have
changed
the
name
of
the
place
no
there
s
one
thing
they
haven
t
changed
the
private
buryin
family
hogg
s
there
all
right
an
never
a
parson
in
the
countryside
dared
to
speak
to
god
about
his
soul
when
they
laid
him
there
his
nephew
too
that
was
as
as
himself
but
the
rest
of
the
graves
has
got
no
slaves
them
as
he
kept
for
his
own
service
an
killed
in
his
tantrums
nobody
knows
how
many
you
can
see
the
bend
of
the
creek
where
they
lie
from
the
road
and
the
old
willows
that
lean
over
cheerful
sort
of
person
the
late
hogg
seems
to
have
been
any
relics
of
his
trade
in
the
house
relics
you
may
say
so
his
old
pistols
and
compasses
guns
nautical
instruments
and
the
leaded
whalebone
whip
that
they
used
to
say
he
slept
with
they
ve
got
em
hung
on
the
walls
now
for
ornyments
ornyments
if
they
d
seen
em
as
i
ve
seen
em
they
d
sink
the
dummed
things
in
a
hundred
fathom
o
clean
sailor
smith
was
on
one
of
the
old
hogg
fleet
one
voyage
explained
elder
dennett
god
forgive
me
for
it
said
the
old
man
there
they
hang
and
with
em
the
chains
isn
t
that
lamp
finished
yet
demanded
kent
turning
sharply
upon
elder
dennett
having
paid
for
something
extra
for
his
led
the
seaman
out
of
the
place
you
were
going
to
say
and
handcuffs
weren
t
you
he
inquired
why
yes
what
of
that
asked
the
veteran
puzzled
suddenly
he
brought
his
hand
down
with
a
slap
on
his
thigh
where
was
my
wits
he
cried
them
irons
on
the
dead
woman
s
knew
i
d
seen
their
like
before
slave
manacles
they
must
a
come
from
hogg
s
haven
very
likely
but
that
suspicion
had
better
be
kept
quiet
at
aye
aye
sir
agreed
the
other
more
devilment
from
the
old
haven
a
bad
rotten
bad
house
yet
i
ve
a
pressing
desire
to
take
a
look
at
it
said
chester
kent
musingly
going
back
to
annalaka
smith
i
ll
walk
with
you
as
far
as
the
road
to
sedgwick
freed
of
the
veteran
s
company
at
the
turn
of
the
road
kent
sat
down
and
took
his
ear
in
hand
to
think
miss
dorrance
he
mused
marjorie
dorrance
what
simpler
twist
for
a
nickname
than
to
transform
that
into
marjorie
daw
poor
sedgwick
at
the
nook
he
found
the
object
of
his
commiseration
mournfully
striving
to
piece
together
as
in
a
mosaic
the
shattered
remnants
of
his
work
sedgwick
brightened
at
his
friend
s
approach
for
heaven
s
sake
come
out
and
do
me
a
couple
of
sets
of
tennis
he
besought
i
m
no
sport
for
you
i
know
particularly
as
my
nerves
are
jumpy
but
i
need
the
sorry
my
boy
said
kent
but
i
ve
got
to
make
a
more
or
less
polite
didn
t
know
you
had
friends
in
this
part
of
the
world
said
sedgwick
in
surprise
oh
friends
said
kent
rather
disparagingly
say
acquaintances
people
named
blair
ever
know
em
used
to
know
a
wilfrid
blair
in
paris
said
the
artist
indifferently
what
kind
of
a
person
was
he
an
agreeable
enough
little
beast
but
a
rounder
of
the
worst
sort
i
won
t
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
shocked
my
moral
sense
in
those
days
but
he
certainly
offended
my
sense
of
decency
he
came
back
to
america
and
i
lost
track
of
him
is
he
the
man
you
re
going
to
see
no
such
luck
said
chester
kent
i
never
expect
to
see
wilfrid
blair
probably
i
shan
t
even
be
invited
to
his
oh
is
he
dead
his
death
is
officially
expected
any
sedgwick
examined
his
friend
s
expression
with
suspicion
officially
then
he
s
very
no
he
isn
t
ill
at
don
t
you
think
you
overdo
this
business
of
mystification
sometimes
kent
merely
a
effort
smiled
the
other
to
divert
your
mind
from
your
own
they
get
any
with
which
cheering
farewell
kent
stepped
out
and
into
his
waiting
car
chapter
unbidden
visitor
one
of
kent
s
washington
friends
once
criticized
the
scientist
s
mode
of
motoring
as
follows
kent
s
a
good
driver
and
a
fast
one
and
careful
but
he
can
never
rid
himself
of
the
theory
that
there
s
a
strain
of
hunter
in
every
travel
was
in
fact
rather
a
fad
of
kent
s
and
he
had
trained
his
light
car
to
do
everything
but
take
a
gate
after
departing
from
the
nook
it
rolled
along
beside
sundayman
s
creek
sedately
enough
until
it
approached
the
wide
bend
where
it
indulged
in
a
bit
of
across
the
country
and
eventually
crept
into
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
bushes
and
hid
its
occupant
emerged
and
went
forward
afoot
until
he
came
in
view
of
hedgerow
house
at
the
turn
of
the
stream
he
leaped
a
fence
and
made
his
way
to
a
group
of
willows
beneath
which
the
earth
was
ridged
with
little
mounds
professor
chester
kent
was
trespassing
he
was
invading
the
territory
of
the
dead
from
the
seclusion
of
the
graveyard
amid
the
willows
a
fair
view
was
afforded
of
hedgerow
house
grim
as
was
the
repute
given
it
it
presented
to
the
intruder
an
aspect
of
homely
hospitable
sweetness
and
quaintness
tall
hollyhocks
lifted
their
flowers
to
smile
in
at
the
windows
here
and
there
on
the
lawn
peonies
glowed
crimson
and
white
a
great
clambering
rose
tree
had
thrown
its
arms
around
the
square
porch
softening
the
uncompromising
angles
into
curves
of
leafage
and
bloom
along
the
paths
pansies
laughed
at
the
sun
and
mignonette
scattered
its
scented
summons
to
bee
and
butterfly
the
place
was
a
loved
place
so
much
kent
felt
with
sureness
of
instinct
no
home
blooms
except
by
love
but
the
house
was
dead
its
eyes
were
closed
silence
held
it
the
garden
buzzed
and
flickered
with
vivid
multicolored
life
but
there
was
no
stir
from
the
habitation
of
man
had
its
occupants
deserted
it
chester
kent
leaning
against
the
headstone
of
captain
hogg
of
damnable
memory
pondered
and
wondered
from
the
far
side
of
the
mansion
came
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
and
closing
again
moving
quickly
along
the
course
of
the
creek
kent
made
a
détour
which
gave
him
view
of
a
side
entrance
and
had
barely
time
to
efface
himself
in
the
shrubbery
when
a
light
wagon
with
a
spirited
horse
between
the
shafts
turned
briskly
out
into
the
road
kent
well
sheltered
caught
one
brief
sufficient
glimpse
of
the
occupant
it
was
doctor
breed
the
medical
officer
looked
as
always
but
there
was
a
greedy
smile
on
his
lips
kent
s
mouth
puckered
he
took
a
deep
breath
of
musical
exhaled
it
in
painful
noiselessness
flattening
himself
amid
the
greenery
as
he
saw
a
man
emerge
from
the
rear
of
hedgerow
house
the
man
was
gansett
jim
he
carried
a
pick
and
a
spade
and
walked
slowly
presently
he
disappeared
in
the
place
of
mounds
the
sound
of
his
toil
came
muffled
to
the
ears
of
the
hidden
man
cautiously
kent
worked
his
way
now
in

for

on

heavier
and
blacker
against

languidly
in

customarily
an
participant
in
the

affairs
of
his
community
he
had
been
shaken
out
of
his
rut
by
the
case
in
which
kent
had
enlisted
him
and
in
which
he
had
thus
far
found
opportunity
for
little
more
than
thought

me
more
than
the
a

humming
rose
in

brought
the
idle
counselor
to
his
window
whence
he
beheld
the

author
of
his
bewilderment
descending
from

car
a
minute
later
the

sitting
with

good

he

no
might

never

closer
n
a

with

he
is

i
expect
the
reason
he
comes

occasionally
is
that
it
s
the
nearest

lo
the

try

all
you

is
to

regrettable
as
his
bad
taste
is
said
kent
with
a
solemn
face
i
fear
that

doesn
t
regard
me
with
that
confidence
and
esteem
which
one
reads
of

and
you
want

the

of

if
you

for
anything
queer
in

official
paper
you
won
t
find
you
ve
examined
it
yourself
good
nevertheless
i
d
like
to
see
the
together
they
went
to
the
medical
officer
s
quarters
doctor
breed
had
come
in
fifteen
minutes
before
without

said
i

aren
t
you
afraid
of
wearin
out
the

on

adam
retorted
the
other
with
a
furtive
grin
and
i
said
chester
kent
in
his
suavest
manner
venture
to
trouble
you
to
show
me
the
certificate
in
the
case
of
wilfrid
something
like
a
spasm
shook
the
lineaments
of
doctor
breed
s
meager
face
blair
he
repeated
how
did
you
he
stopped
short
how
did
i
know
that
wilfrid
blair
is
dead
kent
finished
for
him
why
there
has
been
time
enough
hasn
t
there
the
physician
s
hands
clawed
nervously
at
his
straggling
hair
time
enough
he
murmured
time
enough
i
m
only
just
back
from
the
blair
place
news
travels
faster
than
a
horse
observed
kent
it
don
t
travel
as
fast
as
all
that
retorted
the
medical
officer
and
shut
his
teeth
on
the
sentence
as
if
he
could
have
bitten
the
tongue
that
spoke
it
ah
commented
kent
negligently
then
he
died
within
two
hours
or
so
this
morning
retorted
the
other
it
s
all
in
the
all
inquired
kent
so
significantly
that
lawyer
bain
gave
him
a
quick
look
all
that
s
your
business
or
anybody
else
s
said
breed
recovering
himself
a
bit
doubtless
and
i
m
to
be
permitted
to
see
this
document
breed
pushed
a
paper
across
the
table
there
it
is
i
just
finished
making
it
i
see
said
kent
giving
the
paper
a
scant
survey
that
the
cause
of
death
is
set
down
as
cardiac
failure
well
what
s
the
matter
with
that
just
a
trifle
isn
t
it
you
see
we
all
die
of
cardiac
failure
except
those
of
us
who
fall
from
that
record
s
good
enough
for
the
law
declared
the
medical
officer
doggedly
who
was
the
attending
physician
i
indeed
and
to
what
undertaker
was
the
permit
issued
it
was
issued
to
the
family
they
can
turn
it
over
to
what
undertaker
they
where
is
the
interment
to
be
say
looky
here
man
cried
the
physician
breaking
into
the
sudden
whining
fury
of
timidity
are
you
trying
to
learn
me
my
business
you
can
go
to
hell
that
s
what
you
can
do
with
your
signature
on
my
certificate
inquired
the
scientist
unmoved
i
won
t
trouble
you
so
far
doctor
breed
i
thank
outside
in
the
street
lawyer
bain
turned
to
his
client
you
didn
t
look
at
the
jane
doe
paper
at
no
i
m
not
so
interested
in
that
as
in
the
something
queer
about
this
blair
death
why
the
fact
that
the
attending
physician
and
the
certificating
officer
are
one
and
the
same
that
there
doesn
t
appear
to
be
any
real
cause
of
death
given
or
any
undertaker
and
that
the
interment
is
too
private
for
breed
even
to
speak
of
with
equanimity
might
seem
so
to
a
man
looking
for
not
another
murder
said
the
lawyer
one
side
of
chester
kent
s
face
smiled
no
said
he
positively
certainly
not
there
has
been
a
lot
of
scandal
about
young
blair
i
m
told
perhaps
they
re
burying
him
as
quietly
as
possible
just
to
keep
out
of
the
i
shouldn
t
consider
his
method
of
burial
likely
to
prove
particularly
quiet
returned
kent
of
course
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
not
the
most
private
way
to
get
buried
is
in
well
if
a
death
was
crooked
i
d
want
no
better
man
than
breed
to
help
cover
it
by
the
way
the
sheriff
has
been
away
since
yesterday
afternoon
on
some
business
that
he
kept
to
that
also
may
mean
something
remarked
kent
thoughtfully
now
if
you
ll
find
out
about
that
newspaper
matter
i
ll
go
on
over
to
sedgwick
s
you
can
get
me
there
by
in
the
studio
kent
found
sedgwick
walking
up
and
down
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
head
forward
why
the
caged
lion
effect
inquired
the
scientist
some
one
has
been
having
a
little
fun
with
me
growled
sedgwick
apparently
it
was
what
s
this
on
the
easel
what
would
you
take
it
to
be
let
s
have
a
closer
walking
across
the
room
kent
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
upon
which
had
been
fixed
by
means
of
a
square
of
rather
soft
white
paper
exhibiting
evidence
of
having
been
crumpled
up
and
subsequently
smoothed
out
on
the
paper
was
a
drawing
of
a
woman
s
head
the
delicate
face
beneath
waves
of
short
curly
hair
turned
a
little
from
the
left
shoulder
which
was
barely
indicated
setting
his
useful
monocle
in
his
eye
kent
examined
the
work
carefully
i
should
take
it
he
pronounced
at
length
to
be
a
sort
of
a
attempt
at
a
you
recognize
it
though
it
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
face
of
the
corpse
at
lonesome
pretty
good
likeness
for
a
thing
done
from
memory
i
memory
whose
memory
for
oh
no
that
won
t
do
you
know
it
isn
t
your
style
of
drawing
at
setting
up
for
an
art
critic
are
we
aside
from
which
you
certainly
wouldn
t
be
using
this
sort
of
paper
when
you
ve
cardboard
to
your
so
you
re
not
to
be
caught
i
see
said
sedgwick
with
a
nervous
laugh
not
in
so
plain
a
trap
at
any
rate
where
did
that
precious
work
of
art
come
from
heaven
knows
ching
lung
found
it
lying
on
the
with
a
cobblestone
holding
it
down
i
d
like
to
lay
my
hands
on
the
you
d
crumple
him
up
as
you
did
his
little
message
eh
smiled
kent
at
least
i
d
have
an
explanation
out
of
him
it
s
a
fact
though
that
i
lost
my
temper
and
threw
that
thing
into
a
corner
when
ching
first
handed
it
to
me
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
well
worth
saving
interesting
little
sketch
don
t
you
think
what
you
don
t
find
it
interesting
profoundly
but
it
isn
t
a
what
would
you
call
it
then
a
how
can
you
tell
that
you
haven
t
seen
the
original
from
which
it
was
made
have
you
then
what
s
the
basis
quite
simple
if
you
had
used
your
eyes
on
it
instead
of
your
temper
you
might
have
seen
at
once
that
it
is
a
tracing
look
for
yourself
taking
the
magnifying
monocle
that
kent
held
out
the
artist
scrutinized
the
lines
of
the
picture
by
jove
you
re
right
said
he
it
s
been
transferred
through
and
touched
up
afterward
rather
roughly
too
you
can
see
where
the
copyist
has
borne
down
too
hard
on
the
what
s
your
opinion
of
the
it
is
the
likeness
which
you
suppose
inquired
kent
why
as
i
remember
the
woman
this
picture
is
a
good
deal
idealized
the
hair
and
the
eyes
are
much
the
same
but
the
lines
of
the
face
in
the
picture
are
finer
the
chin
and
mouth
are
more
delicate
and
the
whole
effect
softer
and
of
a
higher
do
you
see
anything
strange
about
the
neck
on
the
left
side
badly
drawn
that
s
just
below
the
ear
there
is
a
sort
of
blankness
isn
t
there
why
yes
it
seems
curiously
unfinished
just
if
you
were
touching
it
up
how
would
you
correct
that
with
a
slight
shading
just
there
where
the
neck
muscle
should
be
thrown
up
a
bit
by
the
turn
of
the
or
by
introducing
a
large
pendant
earring
which
the
copier
has
left
out
kent
you
re
a
wonder
that
would
do
it
exactly
but
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
marvelous
should
the
tracer
of
this
drawing
leave
out
the
earring
obviously
to
keep
the
picture
as
near
like
as
possible
to
the
body
on
the
then
you
don
t
think
it
is
the
woman
of
the
beach
no
i
don
who
else
could
it
possibly
be
perhaps
we
can
best
find
that
out
by
discovering
who
left
the
drawing
that
looks
like
something
of
a
not
very
formidable
i
think
suppose
we
run
up
to
the
village
and
ask
the
local
stationer
who
has
bought
any
there
within
a
day
or
as
the
demand
for
in
martindale
center
was
small
the
stationer
upon
being
called
on
had
no
difficulty
in
recalling
that
elder
dennett
had
been
in
that
afternoon
and
made
such
a
purchase
then
he
must
have
discovered
something
after
i
left
him
said
kent
to
sedgwick
for
he
never
could
have
kept
his
secret
if
he
d
had
it
but
what
motive
could
he
have
cried
the
artist
just
mischief
probably
that
s
enough
motive
for
his
turning
to
the
kent
asked
do
you
happen
to
know
how
dennett
spent
the
early
part
of
this
afternoon
i
surely
do
he
was
up
to
dimmock
s
rummage
auction
an
he
got
something
there
that
tickled
him
like
a
feather
but
he
wouldn
t
let
on
what
it
the
original
said
sedgwick
what
does
dimmock
deal
in
all
kinds
of
odds
and
ends
he
scrapes
the
country
for
bankrupt
sales
an
has
a
big
auction
once
a
year
everybody
goes
you
can
find
anything
from
a
to
a
marriage
certificate
at
his
we
now
call
on
elder
dennett
said
kent
that
worthy
was
about
closing
up
shop
when
they
entered
don
t
your
lamp
work
right
yet
professor
kent
he
inquired
perfectly
responded
the
scientist
we
have
come
to
see
you
on
another
matter
sedgwick
and
first
let
me
thank
you
said
sedgwick
for
the
curious
work
of
art
which
you
left
at
my
inquired
the
elder
with
a
rising
inflection
don
t
take
the
trouble
to
lie
about
it
put
in
kent
just
show
us
the
original
of
the
drawing
which
you
traced
so
the
town
gossip
shifted
uneasily
from
foot
to
foot
how
d
you
know
i
got
the
picture
he
giggled
i
didn
t
find
it
myself
till
i
got
back
from
the
never
mind
the
process
have
you
the
original
here
yes
said
elder
dennett
and
going
to
his
desk
he
brought
back
a
square
of
heavy
bluish
paper
slightly
discolored
at
the
edges
that
s
a
very
good
bit
of
drawing
said
sedgwick
as
he
and
kent
bent
over
the
paper
but
unsigned
said
his
companion
now
dennett
whom
do
you
suppose
this
to
be
why
the
lady
that
stopped
to
talk
with
sedgwick
and
was
killed
in
lonesome
then
why
did
you
leave
out
this
earring
in
copying
the
picture
explained
the
other
in
some
confusion
she
didn
t
have
no
earrings
on
when
i
seen
her
and
it
looks
a
lot
more
like
without
your
bent
for
gratuitous
mischief
amounts
to
a
passion
retorted
the
scientist
some
day
it
will
get
you
into
deserved
trouble
i
i
guess
there
ain
t
no
law
to
prevent
my
givin
away
a
picture
if
i
like
sulked
the
elder
perhaps
you
d
like
to
give
away
another
yankee
shrewdness
sparkled
in
the
eye
of
dennett
mr
sedgwick
said
that
was
a
good
drawin
and
i
guess
he
knows
i
guess
it
s
worth
how
much
money
would
you
guess
five
dollars
replied
the
other
in
a
bold
expulsion
of
breath
at
this
moment
sedgwick
who
had
been
studying
the
picture
in
the
light
made
a
slight
signal
with
his
hand
which
did
not
escape
kent
five
dollars
is
a
big
price
for
a
rough
pencil
sketch
said
the
scientist
i
d
have
to
know
more
of
the
picture
to
pay
that
for
it
where
did
you
find
it
in
this
book
i
bought
the
book
at
dimmock
s
rummage
he
produced
a
decrepit
edition
of
the
agricultural
the
picture
was
stuck
in
between
the
no
name
in
the
book
said
kent
the
flyleaf
is
gone
but
here
s
the
date
of
publication
that
would
be
just
about
right
said
sedgwick
with
lively
interest
right
for
what
demanded
dennett
before
there
was
time
for
reply
kent
had
pressed
a
bill
into
his
hand
with
the
words
you
ve
made
a
wait
protested
the
elder
but
the
sketch
was
already
in
sedgwick
s
possession
it
s
an
elliott
said
that
gentleman
i
m
sure
of
it
i
ve
seen
his
sketches
they
re
very
there
s
an
unmistakable
touch
about
his
pencil
in
that
case
said
kent
suavely
mr
dennett
will
be
gratified
to
know
that
he
has
sold
for
five
dollars
an
article
worth
fifty
times
they
left
him
groaning
at
his
door
and
went
to
look
up
dimmock
the
rummage
man
but
he
was
wholly
unable
to
throw
any
light
on
the
former
owner
of
the
reports
in
which
the
drawing
had
been
tucked
away
there
the
investigation
seemed
to
be
up
against
a
blank
wall
isn
t
it
astounding
said
sedgwick
here
s
a
portrait
antedating
of
a
woman
who
has
just
died
young
what
was
the
woman
i
saw
a
revenant
in
the
flesh
if
you
ask
me
said
kent
slowly
i
should
say
rather
an
further
he
would
not
say
but
insisted
on
returning
to
the
nook
as
they
arrived
the
telephone
bell
was
ringing
with
the
weary
persistence
of
the
to
kent
s
query
lawyer
bain
s
voice
announced
i
ve
been
trying
to
get
you
for
an
sorry
said
kent
is
it
about
the
newspapers
yes
said
the
lawyer
i
ve
got
the
and
he
stated
that
four
newspapers
went
regularly
to
hedgerow
house
new
york
and
and
boston
to
alexander
blair
and
boston
free
to
wilfrid
blair
over
this
information
kent
whistled
in
such
melancholy
tones
that
his
host
was
moved
to
protest
you
re
on
the
track
of
something
and
you
re
keeping
it
dark
from
me
i
m
not
traveling
the
most
brilliantly
illuminated
paths
myself
my
young
friend
replied
kent
and
lapsed
into
silence
the
artist
set
the
elliott
sketch
beside
the
copy
and
compared
them
for
a
time
then
he
fell
to
wandering
desolately
about
the
studio
suddenly
he
turned
walked
over
to
his
friend
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
kent
for
the
love
of
heaven
can
t
you
do
something
for
me
you
mean
about
the
girl
sedgwick
nodded
i
can
t
get
my
mind
to
stay
on
anything
else
even
this
infernal
puzzle
of
the
pictures
doesn
t
interest
me
for
more
than
the
minute
the
longing
for
her
is
eating
the
heart
out
of
my
dear
frank
said
the
other
quietly
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
don
t
you
think
i
d
be
doing
it
it
s
a
very
dark
tangle
and
first
of
all
i
have
to
clear
never
mind
me
what
do
i
care
what
people
think
or
what
she
may
think
sedgwick
s
head
drooped
i
didn
t
consider
it
may
be
the
very
for
if
there
were
only
something
to
do
fretted
the
artist
it
s
this
cursed
inaction
that
is
getting
my
nerve
if
that
s
all
returned
kent
slowly
i
ll
give
you
something
to
do
and
i
fancy
he
added
grimly
it
will
be
sufficiently
absorbing
to
take
your
mind
from
your
troubles
for
a
time
at
bring
it
on
i
m
ready
all
in
good
time
meantime
here
s
a
little
test
for
your
intelligence
problem
continued
kent
with
a
smile
when
the
bewildered
medieval
mind
encountered
a
puzzle
too
abstruse
for
ordinary
human
solution
what
was
its
refuge
magic
i
suppose
said
sedgwick
after
some
consideration
good
you
get
a
high
mark
the
medieval
mind
i
may
observe
was
at
times
worthy
of
i
am
seriously
thinking
my
dear
young
friend
said
kent
solemnly
of
consulting
an
you
re
crazy
retorted
sedgwick
i
wish
i
were
for
a
few
hours
said
kent
with
entire
seriousness
it
might
well
that
s
where
i
ll
be
if
you
don
t
find
something
for
me
to
do
soon
so
come
on
and
materialize
this
promised
if
you
regard
a
trip
to
the
martindale
public
library
as
activity
i
can
furnish
that
much
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
consult
the
files
of
the
newspapers
and
pick
out
a
likely
astrologer
from
the
that
has
a
mild
nutty
flavor
but
it
doesn
t
excite
any
profound
emotion
in
me
except
concern
for
your
you
ve
said
that
before
retorted
kent
however
i
m
not
sure
i
shall
take
you
with
me
then
that
isn
t
the
coming
adventure
no
nothing
so
mild
and
are
you
asking
me
to
run
some
danger
is
it
to
see
said
sedgwick
eagerly
leave
her
out
of
it
for
the
present
there
is
no
question
of
seeing
her
the
artist
sighed
and
turned
away
but
the
danger
is
real
enough
and
pretty
life
isn
t
so
wholly
delightful
to
me
just
at
present
that
i
wouldn
t
risk
it
in
a
good
but
this
is
a
bigger
risk
than
life
there
s
an
enterprise
forward
which
if
it
fails
means
the
utter
damning
of
reputation
what
do
you
say
kent
said
sedgwick
after
a
moment
s
thought
i
m
years
old
ten
years
ago
i
d
have
said
yes
at
the
drop
of
the
question
perhaps
i
value
my
life
less
and
my
good
name
more
than
i
did
then
what
s
the
inducement
the
probable
clearing
up
of
the
case
we
re
is
that
all
the
information
i
get
i
d
rather
not
tell
you
any
more
at
present
it
would
only
get
on
your
nerves
and
unfit
you
for
the
again
sedgwick
fell
into
thought
when
i
come
to
tackle
it
continued
kent
i
may
find
that
one
man
could
do
it
alone
wait
you
re
going
into
it
are
you
oh
with
or
without
me
why
couldn
t
you
have
said
so
at
first
and
saved
this
discussion
cried
his
host
of
course
if
you
re
in
for
it
so
am
i
but
what
about
reputation
it
s
worth
a
good
deal
to
me
confessed
the
scientist
and
i
can
t
deny
i
m
staking
it
all
on
my
theory
of
this
case
if
i
m
it
s
about
the
finis
of
my
see
here
chet
broke
out
his
friend
do
you
think
i
m
going
to
let
you
take
that
kind
of
a
chance
for
me
it
isn
t
for
you
declared
the
other
with
irritation
it
s
for
myself
can
t
you
understand
that
this
is
case
you
re
only
an
incident
in
it
i
m
betting
my
career
against
the
devil
of
mischance
that
i
m
right
as
i
told
you
i
m
naturally
timid
i
don
t
plunge
except
on
a
practically
sure
thing
so
don
t
get
any
foolish
notions
of
obligation
to
me
think
it
over
meantime
do
you
care
to
run
over
to
the
library
no
well
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
can
be
i
can
not
be
found
though
i
ll
be
room
all
right
said
sedgwick
you
needn
t
fear
any
further
intrusion
but
when
is
our
venture
night
replied
kent
wilfrid
blair
having
officially
died
as
per
specifications
chapter
lone
fisherman
trout
are
a
tradition
rather
than
a
prospect
in
sundayman
s
creek
some
indeed
consider
them
a
myth
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
human
breast
however
and
a
fisherman
duly
equipped
might
have
been
observed
testing
the
upper
reaches
of
the
stream
on
the
morning
of
july
tenth
although
his
rod
and
tackle
were
of
the
best
his
apparel
was
rough
not
to
say
scrubby
an
old
slouch
hat
was
drawn
down
over
his
forehead
and
staring
blue
glasses
sheltered
his
eyes
against
the
sun
which
was
sufficiently
most
a
blanket
of
gray
cloud
promising
rain
under
arching
willow
and
by
promising
rock
his
brown
hackle
flickered
temptingly
placed
by
an
expert
hand
but
except
for
one
sunfish
who
had
exhibited
suicidal
curiosity
there
was
none
to
admire
his
proficiency
one
individual
indeed
had
witnessed
it
but
without
urchin
angling
under
a
bridge
for
bullheads
w
at
yer
gittin
with
that
rig
he
had
inquired
with
the
cynicism
of
the
professional
oh
some
snags
and
an
occasional
branch
and
now
and
then
a
milkweed
returned
the
angler
amiably
well
you
can
t
fish
below
the
nex
bend
the
urchin
informed
him
them
folks
that
bought
hogg
s
haven
has
off
the
i
had
just
as
lief
get
tangled
in
a
wire
fence
as
any
other
kind
replied
the
angler
with
cheery
pessimism
whipping
his
fly
into
a
shaded
spot
where
a
trout
would
surely
have
been
lurking
if
the
entire
family
hadn
t
departed
for
the
happy
fishing
grounds
several
generations
back
in
consequence
of
the
pernicious
activities
displayed
by
an
acquisitive
sportsman
with
an
outfit
of
dynamite
in
sticks
suit
yerself
retorted
the
boy
you
won
t
get
nothin
the
rumble
of
a
vehicle
distracted
his
attention
and
he
looked
up
to
observe
with
curiosity
a
carriage
full
of
strangers
pass
across
the
bridge
the
strangers
were
all
in
black
the
angler
had
looked
up
too
but
immediately
looked
away
again
and
turned
to
continue
his
hopeful
progress
toward
the
bend
not
until
he
had
rounded
the
curve
did
he
pause
for
rest
beyond
sight
of
the
youthful
izaak
walton
he
waded
out
upon
the
bank
produced
a
glass
and
applied
it
to
his
eyes
turning
it
upon
the
willow
grove
on
the
borders
of
the
blair
estate
the
briefest
of
surveys
satisfied
him
and
he
resumed
his
fishing
and
his
waiting
he
was
waiting
for
the
funeral
service
of
wilfrid
blair
notices
in
the
boston
and
new
york
papers
had
formally
designated
the
burial
as
private
that
invaluable
aid
lawyer
adam
bain
who
seemed
to
have
his
fingers
on
the
pulse
of
all
the
county
s
activities
had
informed
kent
that
telegraphic
summons
had
gone
out
to
a
few
near
relatives
and
that
the
relatives
together
with
a
clergyman
were
expected
that
morning
that
is
why
chester
kent
a
famous
master
of
the
art
of
fly
fishing
was
whipping
a
dead
stream
for
a
patient
hour
longer
his
questing
flies
explored
unresponsive
nooks
and
corners
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
sighted
a
figure
coming
from
hedgerow
house
and
dodged
into
a
covert
of
sumac
the
glass
brought
out
clearly
the
features
of
alexander
blair
set
stern
and
pale
blair
walked
swiftly
to
the
willow
thicket
where
lay
captain
hogg
and
his
unnamed
victims
looked
down
into
the
raw
fresh
excavation
and
turned
away
another
man
issuing
from
the
house
joined
him
from
his
gestures
alexander
blair
seemed
to
be
explaining
and
directing
finally
both
returned
to
the
house
handling
the
whole
business
himself
commented
kent
i
like
his
courage
half
an
hour
afterward
the
little
funeral
procession
moved
from
the
house
there
was
no
hearse
six
men
carried
the
coffin
they
were
all
strangers
to
kent
and
their
clothes
gave
obvious
testimony
of
city
origin
half
a
dozen
other
men
and
three
women
heavily
veiled
followed
kent
thrust
his
glass
into
his
pocket
and
lifted
his
rod
again
by
the
time
the
clergyman
had
begun
the
service
kent
was
close
to
the
obstructing
fence
he
could
hear
the
faint
solemn
murmur
of
the
words
then
came
the
lowering
of
the
casket
the
onlooker
marked
the
black
and
silver
sumptuousness
of
it
and
thought
of
the
rough
hemlock
box
that
enclosed
the
anonymous
body
in
annalaka
churchyard
and
as
his
fly
met
the
water
he
smiled
a
little
grim
wry
smile
it
was
over
soon
the
group
drifted
away
one
member
paused
to
glance
with
curiosity
at
the
roughly
clad
angler
making
his
way
up
stream
for
kent
judged
it
wise
to
absent
himself
now
foreseeing
the
advent
of
one
than
the
mourners
whose
scrutiny
he
did
not
desire
to
tempt
shortly
gansett
jim
came
to
the
grave
hastily
and
carelessly
he
pitched
in
the
earth
tramped
it
down
and
returned
carriages
rolled
to
the
door
of
hedgerow
house
and
rolled
away
again
carrying
the
mourners
to
their
train
not
until
then
did
kent
snug
up
his
tackle
and
take
the
road
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
hotel
and
changed
into
dry
clothes
than
he
made
haste
to
the
nook
and
thus
addressed
sedgwick
now
i
m
your
man
for
that
tennis
kent
i
don
t
like
your
looks
observed
his
friend
remarking
the
scientist
s
troubled
eyes
don
t
you
where
are
the
implements
of
warfare
here
they
are
said
the
other
producing
rackets
and
balls
you
look
to
me
done
well
the
great
game
is
always
something
of
a
gamble
and
being
usually
played
for
higher
stakes
than
money
is
likely
to
get
on
one
s
the
great
game
repeated
sedgwick
inquiringly
giving
the
words
kent
s
own
emphasis
yes
the
greatest
of
all
games
you
know
the
kipling
verse
don
t
you
go
stalk
the
red
deer
o
er
the
heather
ride
follow
the
fox
if
you
can
but
for
pleasure
and
profit
together
afford
me
the
hunting
of
so
we
re
then
said
the
artist
quickly
far
from
it
replied
kent
with
fervency
let
s
drop
the
subject
for
the
time
being
won
t
you
i
ve
had
a
morning
none
too
pleasant
to
look
back
on
and
i
ve
got
an
evening
coming
none
too
pleasant
to
look
forward
to
therefore
i
shall
probably
give
you
the
licking
of
your
life
on
the
as
to
the
evening
began
sedgwick
while
i
frank
cried
kent
there
s
a
query
trying
to
dislodge
itself
from
your
mind
and
get
put
into
words
don
t
let
it
why
because
at
one
single
question
from
you
i
ll
either
bat
you
over
the
head
with
this
racket
or
burst
into
sobs
it
s
a
he
threw
the
implement
in
the
air
rough
or
smooth
he
called
kent
played
as
he
worked
with
concentration
and
tenacity
backing
up
technical
skill
against
his
dogged
attack
sedgwick
s
characteristically
more
brilliant
game
was
unavailing
though
the
contest
was
not
so
uneven
but
that
both
were
sweating
hard
as
at
the
conclusion
of
the
third
set
they
sought
a
breathing
space
on
the
terraced
bank
back
of
the
court
that
s
certainly
a
good
nerve
sedative
said
the
artist
breathing
hard
and
not
such
rotten
tennis
for
two
aged
relics
of
better
days
like
not
so
bad
by
any
means
agreed
his
opponent
cheerfully
if
you
had
stuck
to
lobbing
i
think
you
d
have
had
me
in
the
second
set
wonder
how
our
spectator
enjoyed
it
he
added
lowering
his
voice
what
spectator
there
s
no
one
here
but
oh
i
think
there
is
don
t
be
abrupt
about
it
but
just
take
a
look
at
that
lilac
copse
on
the
crest
of
the
can
t
see
any
one
there
said
sedgwick
no
more
can
then
what
makes
you
think
there
s
any
one
the
traditional
little
bird
told
meaning
specifically
literally
what
i
say
there
s
the
bird
on
that
young
willow
you
can
see
for
yourself
it
s
trying
to
impart
some
i
see
a
in
a
state
of
some
nervousness
but
are
always
this
particular
one
has
reason
to
be
she
has
a
nest
in
that
lilac
patch
a
few
minutes
ago
she
went
toward
it
with
a
worm
in
her
beak
hastily
dropped
the
worm
and
came
out
in
a
great
state
of
mind
hence
i
judge
there
is
some
intruder
near
her
any
guess
who
it
is
why
it
might
be
gansett
jim
replied
kent
in
a
louder
voice
though
it
s
rather
stupid
of
him
to
pick
out
a
bush
as
a
the
lilac
bush
shook
a
little
and
gansett
jim
came
forth
he
went
to
carr
s
junction
said
the
curtly
you
found
his
trail
asked
kent
the
other
nodded
this
morning
he
said
find
anything
else
no
i
kill
him
if
i
get
him
he
turned
and
vanished
over
the
rise
of
ground
back
of
the
court
now
what
does
that
mean
demanded
sedgwick
in
amazement
that
is
gansett
jim
s
apology
for
suspecting
you
explained
kent
he
is
our
ally
now
and
this
is
his
first
information
what
a
marvelous
thing
the
bulldog
strain
in
a
race
is
nobody
but
an
indian
would
have
kept
to
an
almost
hopeless
trail
as
he
has
the
trail
of
the
real
murderer
cried
sedgwick
kent
shook
his
head
you
re
still
obsessed
with
dubious
evidence
he
remarked
let
me
see
your
having
studied
the
schedules
that
the
artist
produced
for
him
he
nodded
consideringly
boston
it
is
then
he
said
as
i
thought
sedgwick
i
m
off
for
two

three
days
of

this
night
without

turn
of
the
game
night
came
on
in
murk
and
mist
as
the
clouds
gathered
thicker
chester
kent
s
face
took
on
a
more
and
more
satisfied
expression
sedgwick
on
the
contrary
gloomed
sorely
at
the
suspense
nothing
could
be
elicited
from
the
director
of
operations
who
was
for
him
in
rather
wild
spirits
the
tennis
match
seemed
to
have
sweated
the
megrims
out
of
him
he
regaled
his
chafing
friend
with
anecdotes
from
his
varied
career
the
comedy
of
the
dynamiter
s
hair
the
tragedy
of
the
thrice
fatal
telephone
message
at
the
standard
club
the
drama
of
the
orchid
hunt
on
weehawken
heights
from
time
to
time
he
thrust
a
hand
out
of
the
window
shortly
after
midnight
there
was
a
splatter
of
rain
on
the
roof

t
be
better
life
s
a
fine
sport
couldn

be
worse
i
should
think
contradicted
sedgwick
depends
on
the
point
of
view
my
boy
no
longer
can
my
buoyant
spirit
support
your
determined
extraneous
aid
the
time
has
come
for
action
be
thankful

your
sedgwick
brightened
at
once
he
said
get
your
lamps
lighted
and
i
ll
be
with
no
lights
ours
is
a
deep
dark
desperate
devilish
ending
most
likely
in
the
clutch
of
some
constable
for
violation
of
the
highway
possibly
we
ve
got
to
chance
it
come
into
the
garden
maud
chanted
the
scientist
sedgwick
started
i
thought
we
were
going
to
motor
somewhere
what
about
the
garden
about
the
garden
why
somewhere
about
the
garden
there
must
be
i
should
guess
certain
implements
which
we
need
in
our
he
executed
a
solemn
upon
the
floor
and
warbled
oh
a
pickax
and
a
spade
a
spade
for
and
a
shrouding
sheet
a
sudden
thought
struck
cold
into
the
heart
of
sedgwick
be
sensible
can
t
you
he
exclaimed
what
do
you
want
with
a
pickax
and
spade
my
wants
are
few
and
small
if
you
haven
t
a
pick
two
spades
will
do
in
fact
they
ll
be
better
i
was
merely
sticking
to
the
text
of
my
his
shoulders
slumped
his
jaw
slackened
and
as
his
figure
warped
into
the
pose
of
the
gravedigger
he
wheezed
out
the
couplet
again
the
cold
thought
froze
around
sedgwick
s
heart
he
visioned
the
wet
soil
of
annalaka
heaped
above
a
pine
box
within
which
went
forward
the
unthinkable
processes
of
earth
reclaiming
its
own
good
god
is
it
he
muttered
the
mummer
straightened
up
in
plain
prose
do
you
possess
two
spades
he
inquired
speechless
sedgwick
went
out
into
the
dark
presently
returning
with
the
tools
kent
took
them
out
and
disposed
them
in
the
car
get
in
he
directed
if
we
had
to
do
this
kent
said
sedgwick
shuddering
in
his
seat
why
haven
t
we
done
it
before
the
other
turned
on
the
power
you
re
on
the
wrong
track
as
usual
he
remarked
it
couldn
t
be
done
well
it
can
t
be
done
now
cried
the
artist
in
sudden
sharp
excitement
it
won
t
do
stop
the
car
kent
kent
s
voice
took
an
ominously
deliberate
measure
listen
said
he
i
am
going
through
with
if
you
wish
to
that
s
enough
growled
the
artist
no
man
alive
can
say
that
to
the
car
slowed
up
i
beg
your
pardon
frank
said
kent
we
re
both
of
us
a
little
on
edge
this
is
no
time
for
misunderstandings
what
is
on
your
mind
just
this
annalaka
is
watched
lawyer
bain
said
as
much
don
t
you
remember
he
told
us
that
the
house
next
door
is
occupied
by
an
old
sleepless
asthmatic
who
spends
half
her
nights
in
her
window
overlooking
the
the
car
shot
forward
again
is
that
all
asked
kent
isn
t
it
enough
hardly
we
re
not
going
within
miles
of
then
our
night
s
work
is
kent
could
feel
his
companion
s
revolt
at
the
unuttered
word
and
supplied
it
for
him
grave
robbery
it
where
in
a
private
on
the
blairs
wilfrid
blair
s
grave
when
was
the
funeral
this
morning
i
was
among
those
present
though
i
don
t
think
my
name
will
be
mentioned
in
the
why
should
you
have
been
there
oh
set
it
down
to
vulgar
curiosity
said
kent
probably
you
d
say
the
same
if
i
asked
you
the
motive
for
this
present
expedition
i
suppose
you
fully
appreciate
the
chance
we
are
taking
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
it
was
rather
more
than
a
risk
something
cold
touched
sedgwick
s
hand
in
the
darkness
his
fingers
closed
around
a
flask
no
no
dutch
courage
for
me
where
is
this
place
on
sundayman
s
creek
some
fourteen
miles
from
the
nook
as
the
fourteen
miles
repeated
sedgwick
musingly
following
a
train
of
thought
that
suddenly
glowed
a
of
hope
and
these
blairs
have
some
connection
with
the
dead
woman
of
the
cove
the
woman
who
wore
his
fingers
gripped
and
sank
into
kent
s
arm
chet
for
the
love
of
heaven
tell
me
is
she
one
of
these
blairs
no
nonsense
sedgwick
returned
the
other
sternly
you
re
to
act
and
orders
till
the
night
s
job
is
there
was
silence
for
nearly
half
an
hour
while
the
car
slipped
ghostlike
along
the
wet
roadway
presently
it
turned
aside
and
stopped
foot
work
now
said
kent
take
the
spades
and
he
himself
leading
the
way
carried
a
coil
of
rope
on
his
shoulders
for
what
sedgwick
reckoned
to
be
half
a
mile
they
wallowed
across
soaked
meadows
until
the
whisper
of
rain
upon
water
came
to
his
ears
keep
close
directed
his
guide
and
preceded
him
down
a
steep
bank
the
stream
was
soon
forded
emerging
on
the
farther
side
they
scrambled
up
the
other
bank
into
a
thicker
darkness
where
sedgwick
colliding
with
a
gnarled
tree
trunk
stood
lost
and
waiting
a
tiny
bar
of
light
appeared
it
swept
across
huddled
and
mounds
marked
only
by
the
carpet
of
faithful
plant
whose
mission
it
is
to
garland
the
graves
of
the
forsaken
and
the
whitely
back
from
the
headstone
of
the
old
came
to
a
rest
upon
a
fresh
garish
ridge
of
earth
all
pasty
and
yellow
in
the
rain
and
abruptly
died
too
dangerous
to
use
the
lantern
murmured
kent
take
the
near
end
and
delving
even
in
the
most
favorable
circumstances
is
a
fairly
stern
test
of
wind
and
muscle
in
the
pitch
blackness
under
such
conditions
it
was
an
ordeal
both
men
fortunately
were
in
hard
training
the
heavy
soil
flew
steadily
and
fast
soon
they
were
waist
deep
kent
in
a
low
voice
bade
his
fellow
toiler
stop
mustn
t
wear
ourselves
out
at
the
start
he
said
take
five
minutes
at
the
end
of
three
minutes
sedgwick
was
groping
for
his
spade
i
ve
got
to
go
on
chet
he
gasped
the
silence
and
idleness
are
too
much
for
it
s
just
as
well
assented
his
commander
the
clouds
are
breaking
worse
luck
and
some
one
might
possibly
be
up
and
about
in
the
house
go
to
it
this
time
there
was
no
respite
until
with
a
thud
which
ran
up
his
arm
to
his
heart
kent
s
iron
struck
upon
wood
both
men
stood
frozen
into
attitudes
of
attention
no
sound
came
from
the
house
easy
now
warned
kent
after
he
judged
it
safe
to
continue
i
thought
that
jim
dug
deeper
than
that
spade
it
out
gently
and
feel
for
the
i
ve
got
one
whispered
sedgwick
climb
out
then
and
pass
me
down
the
as
sedgwick
gained
the
earth
s
level
the
moon
sailing
from
behind
a
cloud
poured
a
flood
of
radiance
between
the
tree
trunks
kent
s
face
as
he
raised
it
from
the
grave
stretching
out
his
hand
for
the
cord
was
ghastly
but
his
lips
smiled
encouragement
all
right
one
minute
now
and
we
re
safe
repeated
the
other
with
that
opened
grave
i
shall
never
feel
safe
from
between
the
earthen
walls
kent
s
voice
came
muffled
safe
as
a
church
he
averred
from
the
minute
that
we
have
the
coffin
take
this
end
of
the
rope
got
it
now
this
one
it
s
fast
fore
and
aft
here
i
with
a
leap
he
clambered
out
of
the
excavation
he
took
one
end
of
the
rope
from
sedgwick
s
hand
all
ready
to
haul
he
inquired
in
tones
wait
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
demanded
his
we
can
never
get
it
to
the
a
low
chuckle
sounded
from
the
shrubbery
back
of
them
the
resurrectionists
stood
stricken
an
owl
whispered
sedgwick
at
length
no
replied
kent
in
the
same
tone
then
in
full
voice
and
with
vivid
urgency
up
came
the
heavy
casket
bumping
and
grating
even
through
the
rope
sedgwick
felt
with
horror
the
tumbling
of
the
helpless
sodden
body
within
with
a
powerful
effort
kent
swung
his
end
up
on
the
mound
the
lantern
flashed
by
its
gleam
sedgwick
saw
kent
striving
to
force
his
under
the
coffin
lid
to
pry
it
loose
the
chuckle
sounded
again
that
s
enough
said
a
heavy
voice
with
a
suggestion
of
mirthful
appreciation
sheriff
len
schlager
stepped
from
behind
a
tree
he
held
a
revolver
on
kent
sedgwick
made
a
swift
motion
and
the
muzzle
swung
accurately
on
him
steady
frank
warned
kent
anxiously
i
m
steady
enough
returned
the
other
what
a
fool
i
was
not
to
bring
a
oh
no
contradicted
the
scientist
of
what
use
is
my
gun
we
re
in
the
light
and
he
is
in
the
so
you
ve
got
a
gun
on
you
eh
remarked
the
sheriff
his
chuckle
deepening
i
didn
t
say
no
but
you
gave
yourself
away
hands
up
please
both
of
four
hands
went
up
in
the
air
kent
s
face
in
the
light
was
very
downcast
but
from
the
far
corner
of
his
mouth
came
the
faintest
ghost
of
a
whistled
in
a
minor
key
it
died
away
on
the
night
air
and
the
musician
spoke
in
rapid
french
la
ruse
gagne
quand
lui
donnerai
le
coup
de
pied
á
what
s
that
gibberish
demanded
schlager
very
well
said
sedgwick
quickly
in
the
tone
of
one
who
accepts
instructions
i
ll
be
still
enough
go
ahead
and
do
the
better
both
keep
still
advised
the
deceived
sheriff
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
at
the
trial
and
the
penalty
for
is
twenty
years
in
this
yes
but
what
constitutes
murmured
kent
you
do
i
guess
retorted
the
humorous
sheriff
steady
with
those
hands
which
pocket
please
professor
coat
if
you
want
my
money
answered
the
scientist
sullenly
nothing
like
that
laughed
the
officer
your
gun
will
do
at
i
haven
t
got
any
i
heard
you
say
it
remember
mine
is
pointed
at
your
correct
place
approved
kent
quietly
shifting
his
weight
to
his
left
foot
it
s
the
seat
of
human
courage
well
as
schlager
tapped
pocket
after
pocket
without
result
you
can
t
say
i
didn
t
warn
you
frank
with
the
word
there
was
a
sharp
spat
as
the
heel
of
kent
s
heavy
boot
flying
up
in
the
de
of
his
own
devising
caught
the
sheriff
full
on
the
wrist
breaking
the
bones
and
sending
the
revolver
into
the
darkness
as
instantly
sedgwick
struck
swinging
and
schlager
went
down
pin
him
frank
ordered
kent
but
sedgwick
needed
no
directions
now
that
resolute
action
was
the
order
of
the
moment
his
elbow
was
already
pressed
into
the
sheriff
s
bull
neck
schlager
lay
still
moaning
a
little
good
work
my
boy
approved
kent
who
had
retrieved
the
revolver
who
clubbed
me
groaned
the
fallen
man
i
didn
t
see
no
third
feller
and
what
good
s
it
going
to
do
you
anyway
there
you
are
and
there
s
the
robbed
grave
exaggerated
by
assault
on
an
officer
of
the
law
he
added
technically
that
is
right
too
kent
added
sedgwick
with
shaking
voice
whatever
we
do
i
don
t
see
but
what
we
are
disgraced
and
unless
suggested
kent
with
malice
we
rid
ourselves
of
the
only
witness
to
the
a
little
gasp
issued
from
the
thick
lips
of
len
schlager
but
he
spoke
with
courage
and
not
without
a
certain
dignity
you
got
me
he
admitted
quietly
if
it
s
killin
i
guess
it
s
as
good
a
way
to
go
as
any
an
officer
in
the
discharge
of
his
not
so
sure
about
the
duty
schlager
said
kent
with
a
change
of
tone
but
your
life
is
safe
enough
in
any
event
pity
you
re
such
a
grafter
for
you
ve
got
your
decent
points
let
him
up
relieved
of
his
assailant
s
weight
schlager
undertook
to
rise
set
his
hand
on
the
ground
and
collapsed
with
a
groan
too
bad
about
that
wrist
said
kent
i
ll
take
you
back
in
my
car
to
have
it
looked
after
as
soon
as
we
ve
finished
i
s
pose
you
know
i
ll
have
to
arrest
you
just
the
don
t
bluff
retorted
the
other
carelessly
it
wastes
time
steady
here
comes
the
rest
of
the
across
the
moonlit
lawn
moved
briskly
the
spare
alert
figure
of
the
owner
of
hedgerow
house
his
hand
grasped
a
pistol
he
made
straight
for
the
grove
of
graves
within
five
yards
of
the
willows
he
stopped
because
a
voice
from
behind
one
of
them
had
suggested
to
him
that
he
do
so
i
also
am
armed
the
voice
added
hesitancy
flickered
in
blair
s
face
for
a
brief
moment
then
with
set
jaw
he
came
on
two
men
of
courage
to
deal
with
in
a
single
night
that
s
all
out
of
proportion
commented
the
voice
with
a
slight
laugh
mr
blair
i
really
should
dislike
shooting
who
are
you
demanded
blair
chester
what
are
you
doing
on
my
property
at
this
hour
ah
it
was
hardly
an
exclamation
rather
it
was
a
contained
commentary
blair
had
noted
the
exhumed
casket
you
might
better
have
taken
my
offer
he
continued
after
a
pause
of
some
seconds
i
think
sir
you
have
dug
the
grave
of
your
own
that
remains
to
be
schlager
are
you
there
yes
blair
they
ve
broken
my
wrist
and
got
my
blair
took
that
under
consideration
it
doesn
t
strike
me
that
you
are
much
of
a
he
observed
judicially
who
are
francis
sedgwick
is
the
other
at
your
service
answered
the
owner
of
that
name
an
extraordinary
convulsion
of
rage
distorted
the
set
features
of
the
elderly
man
you
he
cried
haven
t
you
done
this
i
would
come
on
now
if
hell
yawned
for
stricken
with
amazement
at
the
hatred
in
the
tone
sedgwick
stood
staring
but
kent
stepped
before
the
advancing
man
this
won
t
do
he
said
firmly
we
can
t
any
of
us
afford
i
can
contradicted
blair
you
would
gain
nothing
by
it
if
one
of
us
is
killed
the
other
will
finish
the
task
you
know
what
i
am
here
for
blair
i
purpose
to
open
that
coffin
and
then
no
said
the
master
of
hedgerow
house
and
it
was
twenty
years
since
his
no
had
been
overborne
yes
returned
chester
kent
quietly
blair
s
arm
rose
steady
and
slow
with
the
inevitable
motion
of
machinery
if
you
shoot
pointed
out
kent
you
will
rouse
the
house
is
there
no
one
there
from
whom
you
wish
to
conceal
that
coffin
the
arm
rose
higher
until
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
glared
like
a
baleful
lusterless
eye
into
kent
s
face
instead
of
making
any
with
the
sheriff
s
revolver
the
scientist
turned
on
his
heel
walked
to
sedgwick
and
handed
him
the
weapon
i
m
going
to
open
the
coffin
frank
he
announced
that
pistol
of
blair
s
is
a
target
arm
it
has
only
one
true
put
in
its
owner
but
i
can
score
one
hundred
and
twenty
with
it
at
a
hundred
yards
if
he
should
fire
frank
wing
him
and
then
whatever
happens
get
that
casket
open
that
is
the
one
thing
you
me
and
but
he
may
kill
you
cried
sedgwick
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
he
may
but
i
think
he
won
won
t
he
muttered
the
older
man
on
an
indrawn
breath
i
d
rather
it
was
the
other
scoundrel
but
sedgwick
stepped
to
within
two
paces
of
him
blair
he
said
with
a
snarl
you
so
much
as
with
that
trigger
finger
and
you
re
dead
no
no
killing
frank
countermanded
kent
in
his
place
you
d
perhaps
do
as
he
is
don
t
take
any
chances
blair
besought
the
sheriff
they
re
desperate
characters
look
what
they
done
to
me
there
s
a
testimonial
murmured
kent
as
he
picked
up
his
spade
for
one
who
has
always
worked
on
the
side
of
law
and
he
worked
the
blade
craftily
under
the
lid
and
began
to
pry
the
cover
gave
slightly
blair
s
pistol
sank
to
his
side
i
should
have
shot
before
warning
you
he
said
bitterly
violating
graves
is
i
suppose
your
idea
of
a
lawful
and
orderly
the
rending
crackle
of
the
hard
heavy
wood
was
his
answer
kent
stooped
and
struggled
up
bearing
a
shapeless
heavy
object
in
his
arms
the
object
seemed
to
be
swathed
in
sacking
kent
let
it
fall
to
the
ground
where
it
lopped
and
lay
all
right
said
he
with
a
strong
exhalation
of
relief
i
knew
it
must
be
and
one
never
is
absolute
in
certainty
and
if
i
d
been
wrong
i
think
frank
we
could
profitably
have
used
that
gun
on
ourselves
you
can
drop
it
now
come
over
courageous
though
sedgwick
was
his
nerves
were
of
a
highly
sensitive
order
he
shuddered
back
i
don
t
believe
i
can
do
it
you
must
as
a
witness
come
brace
up
setting
the
bull
lantern
down
kent
produced
a
sedgwick
drew
a
long
breath
and
walking
over
crouched
steeling
his
nerves
against
the
revelation
that
should
come
when
the
cords
should
be
cut
and
the
swathings
reveal
their
contents
if
i
keel
over
don
t
let
me
tumble
into
the
grave
he
said
simply
and
choked
the
last
word
off
from
becoming
a
cry
of
horror
as
he
beheld
his
friend
drive
the
to
the
hilt
in
the
body
and
then
whip
it
across
and
downward
with
a
long
ripping
draw
under
which
the
harsh
cloth
sang
hideously
open
your
eyes
look
look
cried
kent
heartily
a
strong
trickle
of
sand
flowed
out
of
the
rent
in
the
sack
and
spread
upon
the
ground
that
is
all
said
kent
relief
clamored
within
sedgwick
for
expression
he
began
to
laugh
in
short
choking
spasms
quiet
warned
blair
in
a
broken
tone
of
appeal
you
ve
found
out
the
secret
god
knows
what
you
ll
do
with
it
but
there
are
innocent
people
in
the
house
i
see
a
light
stirring
there
now
must
do
what
i
may
to
shelter
a
glimmer
shone
from
the
ground
floor
of
one
of
the
wings
thither
blair
ran
calling
out
as
he
went
when
he
returned
his
face
was
like
a
mask
now
said
he
what
is
this
matter
blackmail
kent
s
face
withdrew
as
it
were
behind
his
inscrutable
half
smile
peace
if
you
will
said
he
a
truce
at
i
should
like
to
know
just
how
much
you
an
offer
i
will
tell
you
whenever
you
are
ready
to
tell
me
all
that
you
know
i
think
we
are
mutually
in
need
of
each
i
wish
you
were
at
the
bottom
of
that
pit
retorted
the
other
grimly
you
and
your
scoundrel
of
a
friend
with
thank
you
for
myself
said
sedgwick
if
you
were
twenty
years
younger
i
would
break
every
bone
in
your
body
for
steady
frank
put
in
kent
judge
no
man
by
his
speech
who
has
been
through
what
alexander
blair
has
been
through
blair
he
added
you
ve
refused
my
offer
it
is
still
open
and
as
an
extra
i
will
undertake
for
sedgwick
and
myself
that
this
night
s
affair
shall
be
kept
secret
and
now
the
next
thing
is
to
cover
the
evidence
spades
the
two
men
took
up
their
tools
i
ll
spell
you
said
alexander
blair
while
the
sheriff
mourning
softly
over
his
fractured
wrist
sat
watching
the
house
in
case
of
alarm
the
scientist
the
painter
and
the
trust
magnate
sweating
amid
the
nameless
graves
hurriedly
reinterred
the
sack
of
clean
sand
which
bore
the
name
of
wilfrid
blair
and
now
said
chester
kent
petting
his
blistered
palms
as
the
last
shovelful
of
dirt
was
tamped
down
i
ll
take
you
back
with
me
sheriff
to
sedgwick
s
place
and
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
till
the
morning
about
six
o
clock
we
ll
find
you
unconscious
below
the
cliffs
where
you
fell
in
the
darkness
eh
despite
his
pain
the
sheriff
grinned
i
guess
that
s
as
good
as
the
next
lie
he
acquiesced
you
fight
fair
then
answer
me
a
fair
question
what
were
you
doing
at
hedgerow
house
why
you
see
drawled
the
official
i
saw
you
fishin
that
stream
and
it
come
to
my
mind
that
you
was
castin
around
for
more
than
trout
that
wasn
t
there
but
i
didn
t
hardly
think
you
d
come
so
soon
and
i
was
asleep
when
the
noise
of
the
spade
on
the
coffin
woke
bad
work
and
clumsy
commented
kent
with
a
scowl
come
along
my
car
will
carry
three
sedgwick
can
sit
on
the
floor
good
night
blair
all
aboard
there
was
no
answer
what
became
of
sedgwick
demanded
kent
he
was
here
half
a
minute
ago
i
ll
swear
to
that
muttered
the
sheriff
kent
stared
anxiously
about
him
frank
frank
he
called
half
under
his
breath
not
too
loud
besought
alexander
blair
the
clouds
closed
over
the
moon
somewhere
in
the
open
a
twig
crackled
sedgwick
had
disappeared
chapter
meeting
hope
had
surged
up
sudden
and
fierce
in
sedgwick
s
heart
at
the
gleam
of
the
candle
in
hedgerow
house
he
was
ready
for
any
venture
after
the
swift
climax
of
the
night
and
his
hope
hardened
into
determination
faithfully
he
had
taken
kent
s
orders
but
now
the
enterprise
was
concluded
to
what
final
purpose
he
could
not
guess
he
was
his
own
man
again
and
perhaps
behind
that
gleam
from
the
somber
house
waited
the
own
woman
silently
he
laid
his
revolver
beside
his
spade
and
slipped
into
the
shadows
he
heard
kent
s
impatient
query
he
saw
him
as
he
picked
up
the
relinquished
weapon
and
examined
it
and
estimating
the
temper
of
his
friend
was
sure
that
the
scientist
would
not
stop
to
search
for
him
in
this
he
was
right
taking
the
sheriff
by
the
arm
kent
guided
him
through
the
creek
and
into
the
darkness
beyond
blair
walking
with
heavy
steps
and
fallen
head
made
his
way
back
to
the
house
sedgwick
heard
the
door
close
behind
him
a
light
shone
for
a
time
in
the
second
story
it
disappeared
with
infinite
caution
sedgwick
made
the
détour
gained
the
rear
of
the
house
and
skirting
the
north
wing
stepped
forth
in
the
bright
moonlight
the
prescience
of
passion
throbbing
wildly
in
his
breast
she
sat
at
the
window
head
high
to
him
bowered
in
roses
her
face
was
turned
slightly
away
her
long
fine
hands
lay
inert
on
the
sill
her
face
purity
itself
in
the
pure
moonlight
seemed
dimmed
with
weariness
and
strain
a
flower
glowing
through
a
mist
with
a
shock
of
remembrance
that
was
almost
grotesque
sedgwick
realized
that
he
had
no
name
by
which
to
call
her
so
he
called
her
by
the
name
that
is
love
s
own
she
did
not
change
her
posture
but
her
lips
parted
her
lids
drooped
and
quivered
she
was
as
one
in
a
lovely
dream
he
stepped
toward
her
and
spoke
again
you
she
cried
and
her
voice
breaking
from
a
whisper
into
a
thrill
of
pure
music
there
was
in
the
one
syllable
so
much
of
terror
that
his
heart
shivered
so
much
of
welcome
that
his
heart
leaped
so
much
of
joy
that
his
heart
sang
bending
he
pressed
his
lips
on
her
hands
and
felt
them
tremble
beneath
his
kiss
they
were
withdrawn
and
fluttered
for
the
briefest
moment
at
his
temples
then
she
spoke
hurriedly
and
softly
you
must
go
at
once
at
once
when
i
have
just
found
you
if
you
have
any
care
for
my
my
good
away
from
this
house
of
what
said
sedgwick
sharply
of
dread
what
do
you
do
here
then
suffer
said
she
then
bit
her
lips
no
no
i
didn
t
mean
it
it
is
only
that
the
mystery
of
am
unstrung
and
weak
all
will
be
right
only
i
will
said
sedgwick
firmly
and
you
shall
go
with
i
where
he
caught
her
hand
again
and
held
it
to
his
heart
to
see
the
gold
air
and
the
silver
fade
and
the
last
bird
fly
into
the
last
light
he
whispered
don
t
she
begged
not
that
it
brings
back
that
week
too
poignantly
oh
my
dear
please
please
listen
he
said
heart
of
my
heart
i
don
t
know
what
curse
hangs
over
this
house
but
this
i
do
know
that
i
can
not
leave
you
here
come
with
me
now
i
will
find
some
place
for
you
and
we
will
be
with
a
sharp
movement
she
shrank
back
from
him
married
the
words
seemed
to
choke
her
don
t
you
know
who
i
am
fear
chilled
his
mounting
blood
as
kent
s
analysis
of
the
probabilities
came
back
to
him
if
you
are
married
already
he
said
unsteadily
would
be
better
for
me
that
kent
had
let
him
illustration
sat
at
the
window
bowered
in
who
she
cried
what
has
been
passing
here
you
have
been
in
danger
what
does
it
matter
he
returned
what
does
anything
matter
hark
she
broke
in
a
spasm
of
terror
contracting
her
face
footsteps
sounded
within
there
was
the
noise
of
a
door
opening
and
closing
around
the
turn
of
the
wing
alexander
blair
stepped
into
view
his
pistol
was
still
in
his
hand
still
here
sir
he
inquired
with
an
effect
of
murderous
courtesy
you
add
spying
to
your
other
practises
he
took
a
step
forward
and
saw
the
girl
my
god
marjorie
he
cried
sedgwick
turned
white
at
the
cry
but
faced
the
older
man
steadily
i
fear
sir
he
said
that
i
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
the
blame
is
wholly
mine
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
came
here
wholly
without
the
knowledge
your
of
whom
exclaimed
blair
and
in
the
same
moment
the
girl
cried
out
oh
no
no
not
that
not
exclaimed
sedgwick
marjorie
interrupted
blair
do
you
know
this
man
yes
she
said
quietly
since
when
since
two
and
he
has
come
here
before
then
why
do
i
find
him
here
with
you
this
night
of
all
nights
he
is
not
here
with
me
said
she
flushing
i
came
where
you
saw
me
began
sedgwick
on
a
reckless
impulse
believe
me
one
moment
marjorie
i
think
you
had
best
go
to
your
the
girl
s
soft
lips
straightened
into
a
line
of
inflexibility
i
wish
to
speak
to
sedgwick
she
said
speak
then
and
no
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
alone
there
is
an
explanation
which
i
owe
and
there
is
one
which
he
owes
you
retorted
blair
as
he
seems
to
have
been
too
cowardly
to
give
it
i
will
supply
his
deficiencies
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
misunderstanding
let
me
present
francis
sedgwick
the
a
low
cry
the
most
desolate
the
most
stricken
sound
that
sedgwick
had
ever
heard
from
human
lips
trembled
on
the
air
before
he
could
gather
his
senses
to
retort
and
deny
she
had
drawn
herself
to
her
the
window
framed
only
emptiness
sedgwick
whirled
upon
the
other
man
of
course
he
said
with
deceptive
calmness
you
know
that
you
i
know
that
i
speak
truth
retorted
blair
with
so
profound
a
conviction
that
the
other
was
shaken
is
it
possible
that
you
really
believe
it
he
exclaimed
so
possible
that
but
for
the
scandal
i
would
do
what
i
can
not
invoke
the
law
to
do
and
exact
life
for
life
and
to
crown
all
i
find
you
with
my
son
s
your
son
s
wife
the
cry
burst
from
sedgwick
s
lips
the
dead
of
night
at
a
rendezvous
concluded
blair
that
is
a
lie
said
sedgwick
very
low
for
which
i
shall
kill
you
if
you
dare
repeat
it
even
to
your
own
thoughts
it
was
no
rendezvous
is
your
mind
so
vicious
that
you
can
t
believe
in
innocence
stop
and
think
how
could
it
have
been
a
rendezvous
when
i
came
here
as
you
know
for
another
purpose
that
is
true
said
the
other
thoughtfully
that
still
remains
to
be
by
you
returned
the
artist
you
speak
of
your
son
s
wife
to
carry
out
the
farce
of
the
sham
burial
shouldn
t
you
have
said
his
widow
the
widow
of
a
you
well
know
answered
blair
bitterly
as
i
do
know
at
all
but
i
think
i
begin
to
see
light
the
on
the
dead
woman
s
neck
topazes
that
helps
to
clear
it
up
the
dead
woman
was
some
past
of
wilfrid
blair
s
she
came
here
either
to
reassert
her
sway
over
him
or
to
blackmail
him
he
gave
her
his
wife
s
jewels
then
he
followed
her
to
the
cliffs
and
killed
her
perhaps
in
a
drunken
frenzy
and
you
alexander
blair
to
save
your
son
have
concealed
him
somewhere
bribed
the
sheriff
and
the
medical
officer
contrived
this
false
death
and
burial
and
are
now
turning
suspicion
on
a
man
you
know
to
be
innocent
further
to
fortify
your
position
but
what
damnable
lie
have
you
told
during
this
exposition
alexander
blair
s
face
was
a
study
in
changing
emotions
at
the
close
his
thin
lips
curled
in
the
suggestion
of
a
sardonic
grin
i
leave
you
to
the
company
of
your
theory
sir
said
he
and
the
door
closed
sharply
after
him
three
hours
later
wet
and
bedraggled
but
with
a
fire
at
his
heart
the
came
to
his
home
and
roused
kent
from
slumber
on
the
studio
couch
and
where
have
you
been
demanded
the
scientist
she
was
in
the
house
i
ve
seen
exactly
what
i
wished
to
prevent
i
don
t
think
you
ve
done
yourself
any
any
good
groaned
his
friend
she
left
me
believing
that
i
am
the
murderer
of
the
unknown
indeed
you
ve
done
worse
even
than
i
had
feared
tell
in
brief
outline
sedgwick
told
of
the
moonlight
interview
kent
gripped
at
his
ear
lobe
and
for
a
time
sought
silently
to
draw
clarification
of
ideas
from
it
do
you
know
he
said
at
length
i
wouldn
t
wonder
if
blair
really
thought
you
the
i
would
declared
sedgwick
savagely
he
knows
who
murdered
that
woman
it
was
his
own
son
whom
he
pretended
to
bury
for
a
and
the
artist
proceeded
to
outline
eagerly
his
newly
developed
idea
that
s
an
interesting
theory
said
chester
kent
slowly
a
very
interesting
and
ingenious
theory
i
ll
admit
to
you
now
that
something
of
the
sort
occurred
to
my
mind
early
in
the
development
of
the
mystery
but
i
forsook
it
because
of
one
fact
that
rather
militates
against
its
what
is
that
the
fact
replied
kent
with
a
slow
smile
that
wilfrid
blair
was
dead
before
his
father
ever
learned
of
the
tragedy
of
lonesome
chapter
sits
in
suit
case
at
his
side
chester
kent
stood
on
the
platform
of
the
martindale
center
station
waiting
for
the
morning
train
to
boston
before
him
paced
sedgwick
with
a
face
of
storm
this
is
something
i
must
do
for
myself
the
artist
declared
with
that
peculiar
flatness
of
obstinacy
which
goes
with
an
assertion
repeatedly
made
not
you
nor
any
other
man
can
do
it
for
not
you
nor
any
other
man
should
attempt
it
at
all
now
retorted
the
scientist
that
s
the
view
of
the
pedant
cried
sedgwick
what
do
you
know
of
love
nothing
except
as
a
force
obstructive
to
but
chet
i
see
her
again
pleaded
sedgwick
i
exhibit
that
tact
and
delicacy
which
you
displayed
at
your
last
meeting
broke
in
kent
curtly
asking
a
woman
to
marry
you
on
the
day
of
her
husband
s
burial
it
wasn
t
her
husband
s
she
supposed
it
sedgwick
checked
his
nervous
pacing
do
you
think
so
you
believe
she
wasn
t
a
party
to
that
ghastly
fraud
certainly
not
she
attended
the
funeral
ceremony
in
good
faith
in
my
belief
the
real
circumstances
of
blair
s
death
are
as
unknown
to
her
as
they
are
assuming
always
that
he
is
dead
your
confidence
being
so
sound
it
must
be
based
on
something
how
did
he
come
to
his
death
if
i
knew
that
i
shouldn
t
be
going
to
boston
to
consult
an
have
you
still
got
astrology
on
the
brain
hopelessly
smiled
kent
luck
go
with
you
and
yes
and
you
queried
kent
as
the
other
hesitated
i
am
going
back
to
hedgerow
house
concluded
the
artist
obstinately
if
i
were
employed
to
work
on
this
case
observed
kent
dispassionately
if
it
were
a
mere
commission
undertaken
on
money
terms
i
should
throw
it
up
right
here
and
he
took
a
long
strong
pull
at
the
extension
end
of
his
ear
and
whistled
a
bar
or
two
of
do
you
know
room
at
the
eyrie
he
asked
abruptly
no
yes
i
do
too
that
s
your
temple
of
white
silence
isn
t
it
correct
humor
me
thus
far
walk
up
to
the
hotel
give
this
card
to
the
clerk
get
the
key
go
to
that
room
at
once
lie
down
on
your
back
with
your
eyes
open
and
think
for
one
hour
by
the
watch
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
still
believe
you
re
right
go
ahead
will
you
do
it
agreed
it
s
a
bargain
but
it
won
t
change
my
a
bargain
s
a
bargain
it
won
t
need
to
said
kent
coolly
by
that
time
if
i
have
any
understanding
of
alexander
blair
he
will
have
put
your
lady
of
mystery
on
the
morning
train
which
leaves
for
boston
by
one
of
the
other
roads
if
you
may
take
your
tricked
said
sedgwick
well
i
owe
you
too
much
to
go
back
on
my
agreement
here
kent
she
s
going
to
boston
you
re
going
to
boston
you
can
easily
find
out
where
the
blairs
live
go
to
her
for
me
and
heaven
forbid
cried
kent
piously
why
haven
t
i
told
you
that
i
am
a
timid
creature
and
especially
about
females
over
seventy
i
like
em
and
under
seven
i
love
em
between
i
shun
em
i
ll
do
anything
for
you
but
that
my
boy
he
concluded
as
the
train
came
rumbling
in
then
i
shall
have
to
follow
and
look
her
up
myself
returned
his
friend
i
ll
wire
you
before
i
come
by
the
way
said
kent
leaning
out
from
the
car
step
upon
which
he
had
swung
himself
don
t
be
disturbed
if
you
miss
that
drawing
which
we
bought
from
elder
dennett
at
a
miss
it
why
where
is
it
in
my
suit
what
s
it
doing
there
why
you
see
if
it
s
a
sketch
for
a
finished
portrait
by
elliott
as
i
suspect
some
of
the
art
people
in
boston
might
recognize
it
good
luck
i
hope
to
see
you
soon
too
soon
that
is
chance
and
a
deranged
railway
schedule
conspired
against
the
peace
of
mind
of
the
shy
and
shrinking
kent
outside
of
boston
a
few
miles
is
a
junction
and
a
crossing
here
kent
s
train
was
held
up
by
some
minor
accident
here
too
the
train
from
the
north
on
the
other
road
stopped
for
orders
thus
it
was
that
kent
stepping
out
to
take
the
air
found
himself
looking
into
an
open
pullman
window
at
a
woman
s
face
framed
in
deepest
black
a
young
face
but
saddened
and
weary
whose
unforgettable
appeal
of
wistfulness
had
looked
out
upon
him
from
the
canvas
in
sedgwick
s
studio
mrs
blair
for
once
in
his
life
chester
kent
s
controlled
tongue
had
broken
the
leash
immediately
he
would
have
given
a
considerable
sum
of
money
to
recall
his
impulsive
exclamation
he
was
in
an
agony
of
shyness
but
it
was
too
late
the
girlish
face
turned
the
composed
eyes
scanned
a
man
of
indeterminate
age
clad
in
the
cool
elegance
of
light
gray
and
obviously
harassed
by
some
catastrophic
embarrassment
i
beg
stuttered
the
man
are
you
blair
i
m
at
this
astonishing
announcement
amusement
gleamed
in
the
woman
s
eyes
and
gave
a
delicate
to
the
corners
of
the
soft
mouth
i
don
t
recognize
you
in
your
present
attire
kent
she
murmured
no
of
course
not
to
is
you
kent
gathered
his
forces
resolved
desperately
to
see
it
through
now
i
m
blair
and
i
suppose
you
re
the
soft
music
of
her
laughter
made
kent
savage
damn
he
muttered
beneath
his
breath
and
then
went
direct
to
the
point
there
are
things
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
i
wish
to
get
on
your
certainly
not
replied
she
decisively
i
do
not
know
i
am
a
friend
of
francis
sedgwick
the
warm
blood
flushed
her
cheeks
and
died
away
her
lips
quivered
so
much
of
mute
helpless
misery
did
her
face
show
that
kent
s
embarrassment
vanished
try
to
believe
me
he
said
earnestly
when
i
tell
you
that
i
wish
only
to
save
both
of
you
misunderstanding
and
suffering
misunderstanding
and
suffering
he
added
it
is
too
late
she
said
hopelessly
forgive
me
but
that
is
foolish
your
mind
has
been
led
astray
sedgwick
is
absolutely
please
she
begged
in
a
half
whisper
i
can
t
listen
i
mustn
t
listen
i
have
tried
to
make
myself
believe
that
he
acted
in
but
even
so
don
t
you
see
it
must
stand
forever
between
us
now
what
story
has
alexander
blair
told
her
kent
demanded
of
his
mind
how
much
does
she
know
or
how
little
the
jar
and
forward
lurch
of
the
car
before
him
brought
him
out
of
his
reverie
can
i
see
you
in
boston
he
asked
hurriedly
she
shook
her
head
not
now
i
can
see
no
one
and
remember
i
do
not
even
know
kent
cast
about
rapidly
in
his
mind
as
he
walked
along
with
the
car
for
some
one
who
might
be
a
common
acquaintance
he
mentioned
the
name
of
a
very
great
psychologist
at
harvard
do
you
know
him
he
asked
yes
he
is
my
mother
s
and
my
valued
friend
he
cried
may
i
get
him
to
bring
me
he
was
almost
running
now
beside
the
window
yes
she
assented
if
you
insist
but
i
will
hear
no
word
your
i
understand
agreed
called
kent
morning
and
he
walked
whistling
a
melancholious
theme
to
the
platform
another
whistle
answered
his
it
was
that
of
his
train
disappearing
around
the
curve
a
mile
down
the
track
belated
but
elated
kent
after
some
inquiries
reached
his
destination
by
an
intricate
exchange
of
trolley
lines
and
went
direct
to
cambridge
he
found
his
friend
one
of
the
finest
and
profoundest
philosophers
of
his
time
sitting
in
a
closed
house
over
a
game
of
that
form
of
solitaire
appropriately
denominated
idiot
s
very
soothing
to
the
mind
murmured
the
professor
after
welcoming
his
guest
so
many
matters
turn
out
wrong
in
this
world
that
one
finds
relief
in
a
problem
which
usually
turns
out
i
ve
a
little
problem
of
my
own
which
may
or
may
not
turn
out
right
said
kent
and
i
want
your
it
is
long
since
you
have
done
me
the
honor
to
consult
me
said
the
old
scholar
smiling
not
indeed
since
the
instance
of
the
cabinet
member
who
was
obsessed
with
a
maniacal
hatred
of
without
you
i
should
never
have
so
much
as
approached
the
solution
of
carolan
s
recall
returned
kent
but
this
present
affair
calls
for
aid
not
either
is
equally
at
your
service
replied
the
philosopher
courteously
kent
outlined
the
case
to
him
you
see
he
said
there
is
an
obvious
connection
between
the
unknown
body
on
the
beach
and
the
blair
poor
marjorie
exclaimed
the
old
man
for
her
marriage
i
blame
myself
largely
when
marjorie
dorrance
was
left
an
orphan
i
was
her
nearest
relative
of
an
age
and
position
such
as
to
constitute
a
moral
claim
of
guardianship
she
visited
here
when
she
was
eighteen
came
like
a
flood
of
sunlight
into
this
house
a
beautiful
vivid
girl
with
a
beautiful
vivid
mind
for
her
mother
s
sake
if
not
for
her
own
i
should
have
watched
over
her
and
warded
her
against
the
danger
of
an
advantageous
marriage
such
as
is
always
imminent
in
the
set
which
she
entered
ah
well
i
live
among
the
dust
and
cobwebs
of
my
own
dim
when
i
returned
from
one
of
my
journeys
into
the
past
i
found
that
marjorie
was
engaged
to
that
wretched
creature
now
he
is
dead
let
be
i
have
seen
little
of
her
in
late
years
god
grant
the
life
with
him
has
not
crushed
out
of
her
all
her
sweetness
and
while
i
am
no
judge
of
women
said
kent
judicially
i
should
venture
to
aver
that
it
hasn
t
but
about
calling
on
being
a
stranger
you
in
the
first
days
of
her
conventions
and
that
sort
of
the
old
scholar
made
a
sweeping
gesture
of
surprising
swiftness
suggesting
incongruously
the
possession
of
great
muscular
power
the
cards
flew
far
and
wide
from
the
stand
mist
and
moonshine
my
dear
sir
moonshine
and
mist
marjorie
is
one
of
those
rare
human
beings
who
deal
honestly
with
themselves
her
husband
s
death
can
be
nothing
but
a
welcome
release
she
feels
no
grief
she
will
pretend
to
none
not
even
to
herself
i
will
take
you
to
her
blair
her
asked
kent
oh
that
is
a
wide
term
i
believe
that
the
poor
weakling
did
his
best
to
keep
faith
and
honor
but
ropes
of
mud
are
strong
those
with
which
he
had
bound
himself
drew
him
resistlessly
back
to
the
sewers
hers
was
but
a
marriage
of
glamour
at
best
and
at
the
first
scent
of
foulness
in
her
nostrils
it
became
only
a
marriage
of
law
society
does
her
the
justice
to
believe
her
faithful
to
him
and
praises
the
devotion
with
which
since
his
breakdown
and
retirement
she
has
given
up
her
world
to
devote
herself
to
his
care
essentially
the
girl
is
puritan
in
her
concepts
of
does
she
know
anything
of
the
manner
of
blair
s
death
no
one
knows
much
of
it
from
what
i
understand
unless
it
be
alexander
blair
one
of
the
family
who
went
to
hedgerow
house
for
the
funeral
called
upon
me
as
a
courtesy
due
to
blair
s
nearest
relative
alexander
blair
he
said
was
reticent
his
dread
of
publicity
is
notorious
but
from
what
he
the
relative
could
ascertain
the
affair
was
substantially
this
on
the
evening
before
the
woman
s
body
was
found
wilfrid
blair
who
had
been
exhibiting
symptoms
of
melancholia
left
the
house
secretly
no
one
saw
him
go
but
about
the
time
that
he
left
the
unknown
woman
was
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
hedgerow
by
whom
by
a
indian
a
devoted
servant
of
the
family
who
was
practically
young
blair
s
gansett
jim
that
helps
to
whether
or
not
wilfrid
blair
had
arranged
a
meeting
with
this
woman
is
not
known
as
you
know
she
was
found
with
her
skull
crushed
on
the
sea
beach
blair
was
afterward
discovered
by
his
servant
mortally
injured
and
was
brought
home
to
that
is
alexander
blair
s
version
of
the
tragedy
as
i
understand
well
it
s
but
untrue
in
one
vital
particular
at
are
you
at
liberty
to
state
what
it
is
wilfrid
blair
never
was
brought
ah
in
any
case
alexander
blair
is
striving
to
conceal
some
scandal
the
nature
of
which
i
have
no
wish
to
guess
by
the
way
i
should
have
added
that
he
suspects
a
third
person
an
artist
resident
not
far
from
his
place
of
being
his
son
s
francis
you
know
the
man
it
is
on
his
behalf
that
i
am
acting
replied
kent
my
informant
however
inclines
to
the
belief
that
alexander
blair
is
wrong
that
wilfrid
blair
killed
the
woman
and
then
inflicted
mortal
wounds
upon
himself
perhaps
you
would
better
see
my
informant
for
unnecessary
thank
you
blair
is
not
telling
quite
all
that
he
knows
nevertheless
the
theory
which
he
propounds
as
to
his
son
s
assailant
is
natural
enough
from
his
point
of
view
although
added
kent
thoughtfully
it
will
be
most
unfortunate
if
it
leads
him
to
distrust
marjorie
am
i
to
infer
that
her
good
name
is
involved
demanded
the
old
man
hardly
her
good
name
blair
i
correctly
follow
his
mental
francis
sedgwick
met
his
son
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
by
chance
or
otherwise
and
that
in
the
encounter
which
he
believes
followed
wilfrid
blair
was
killed
unfortunately
some
color
of
motive
is
lent
to
this
by
the
fact
that
sedgwick
had
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
impossible
marjorie
is
not
the
woman
to
permit
such
a
without
blame
to
her
or
indeed
to
either
of
them
she
also
believes
now
that
sedgwick
killed
her
she
was
interested
in
your
friend
asked
the
old
scholar
slowly
i
is
i
trust
you
trust
so
with
this
horror
standing
between
them
it
must
be
cleared
away
said
kent
earnestly
circumstantial
evidence
is
against
sedgwick
but
i
give
you
my
word
sir
it
is
wholly
impossible
that
he
should
have
killed
your
niece
s
to
doubt
your
certainty
would
be
crassly
stupid
and
are
you
hopeful
of
clearing
up
the
circumstances
there
i
want
your
aid
the
night
of
the
tragedy
a
person
wearing
a
dark
garment
embroidered
with
silver
stars
was
on
hawkill
heights
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
person
came
there
to
meet
some
one
from
the
blair
place
also
that
he
can
tell
me
if
i
can
find
him
the
facts
which
i
lack
to
fill
out
my
theory
it
is
to
run
him
down
that
i
have
come
to
a
man
wearing
a
dark
garment
embroidered
with
silver
stars
said
the
philosopher
surely
a
strange
garb
in
this
age
of
sartorial
not
for
an
ah
an
astrologer
and
you
think
he
came
from
boston
i
think
said
chester
kent
drawing
some
newspaper
clippings
from
his
pocket
that
somewhere
among
these
advertisements
taken
from
the
newspapers
which
are
subscribed
for
at
hedgerow
house
he
is
to
be
there
i
ought
to
be
able
to
help
through
my
association
with
the
occult
society
i
have
investigated
many
of
these
gentry
great
rascals
most
of
whom
would
you
consider
the
most
able
of
the
lot
the
old
man
set
a
finger
on
one
of
the
clippings
preston
jax
said
he
is
the
shrewdest
of
them
all
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
he
had
dim
flashes
of
real
clairvoyance
be
that
as
it
may
he
has
a
surprising
clientele
of
which
he
makes
the
most
for
he
is
a
at
cozening
women
out
of
their
money
more
than
once
he
has
been
in
the
probably
he
is
my
man
anyway
i
shall
visit
him
first
and
if
i
find
that
his
office
was
closed
on
july
it
was
and
for
a
day
or
two
thereafter
as
i
chance
to
know
because
one
of
the
occult
society
s
secret
agents
was
to
have
visited
him
and
could
not
get
an
good
i
shall
see
you
then
clarity
of
vision
go
with
you
amid
your
riddles
said
his
host
with
a
smile
shuffling
the
cards
which
kent
had
gathered
up
for
him
here
is
my
riddle
watch
me
now
how
i
meet
and
vanquish
the
demon
he
turned
up
a
card
ah
said
he
with
profound
satisfaction
the
seven
of
spades
my
luck
runs
in
chapter
master
of
stars
ten
o
clock
of
the
following
morning
found
the
harvard
professor
formally
presenting
his
friend
chester
kent
to
wilfrid
blair
at
the
house
of
the
cousin
with
whom
she
was
staying
my
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
you
may
trust
professor
kent
s
judgment
and
insight
as
implicitly
as
his
honor
i
can
give
no
stronger
recommendation
and
will
now
take
my
kent
resisted
successfully
a
wild
and
fearful
desire
to
set
a
restraining
hold
upon
the
disappearing
coat
tails
for
embarrassment
had
again
engulfed
the
scientist
s
soul
he
seized
himself
by
the
lobe
of
the
ear
with
that
grip
which
drowning
men
reserve
for
straws
continue
the
ear
sank
with
him
beneath
the
waves
of
confusion
blair
s
first
words
did
not
greatly
help
him
have
you
an
earache
professor
kent
she
inquired
maliciously
yes
no
it
s
a
habit
muttered
the
caller
releasing
his
hold
and
immediately
resuming
it
isn
t
it
very
painful
of
course
it
is
said
he
testily
when
i
forget
to
let
go
in
i
frequently
as
you
are
doing
now
she
suggested
kent
bestowed
a
final
yank
upon
the
dried
fount
of
inspiration
and
gave
it
up
as
hopeless
i
don
t
know
exactly
how
to
begin
he
complained
then
i
will
help
you
said
she
becoming
suddenly
grave
you
are
here
to
speak
to
me
of
some
topic
wholly
distinct
from
one
forbidden
exactly
you
make
it
difficult
for
me
by
that
restriction
and
i
rather
like
reason
let
me
see
have
you
lost
any
jewels
lately
blair
the
started
yes
how
did
you
know
you
have
made
no
complaint
or
published
no
advertisements
for
them
i
have
kept
it
absolutely
secret
father
blair
insisted
that
i
should
do
they
were
valuable
these
jewels
the
rings
were
intrinsically
but
what
i
most
valued
was
the
necklace
of
they
were
the
grosvenor
a
family
relic
not
my
own
family
my
husband
s
mother
left
them
to
me
they
came
down
to
her
from
her
grandmother
camilla
you
speak
that
name
as
if
it
should
be
recognizable
by
perhaps
it
would
if
you
were
a
new
englander
she
was
rather
a
famous
person
in
her
time
elliott
painted
of
his
finest
portraits
i
believe
she
was
remarkable
in
other
would
you
mind
being
more
specific
it
isn
t
mere
curiosity
on
my
why
my
uncle
could
have
told
you
more
he
knows
all
about
the
grosvenors
my
own
knowledge
of
camilla
grosvenor
is
merely
family
tradition
she
was
a
woman
of
great
force
of
character
and
great
personal
attraction
i
believe
though
she
was
not
exactly
beautiful
when
she
was
still
under
thirty
she
became
the
leader
of
a
band
of
mystics
and
i
believe
that
she
became
infatuated
with
one
of
them
a
young
german
and
that
there
was
an
elopement
by
water
this
i
remember
at
least
her
body
washed
ashore
on
the
coast
not
very
far
from
hedgerow
at
lonesome
cove
yes
the
very
name
of
it
chills
me
for
my
husband
it
had
an
uncanny
fascination
he
used
to
talk
to
me
about
the
place
he
even
wanted
to
build
there
but
alexander
blair
wouldn
t
listen
to
would
you
know
the
face
of
camilla
grosvenor
of
course
the
elliott
portrait
hangs
in
the
library
at
hedgerow
kent
took
from
under
his
coat
the
drawing
purchased
from
elder
dennett
that
is
the
same
said
blair
unhesitatingly
it
isn
t
quite
the
same
pose
as
the
finished
portrait
and
it
lacks
the
earring
which
is
in
the
portrait
but
i
should
say
it
is
surely
elliott
s
work
couldn
t
it
be
a
preliminary
sketch
for
the
portrait
probably
that
is
what
it
can
you
tell
me
where
it
came
from
from
between
the
pages
of
an
old
book
it
must
have
been
carelessly
thrown
aside
the
book
has
just
been
sold
at
an
auction
in
martindale
center
and
the
drawing
found
by
a
man
who
didn
t
appreciate
what
it
was
i
bought
it
from
that
s
rather
wonderful
isn
t
it
there
are
more
wonders
to
come
tell
me
how
your
necklace
was
lost
i
don
t
know
on
the
afternoon
of
july
fifth
i
left
hedgerow
house
rather
hurriedly
my
maid
whom
i
trust
implicitly
was
to
follow
with
my
trunks
including
my
jewel
case
she
arrived
a
day
later
with
part
of
the
jewels
missing
and
a
note
from
father
blair
saying
that
there
had
been
a
robbery
but
that
i
was
to
say
nothing
of
july
fifth
remarked
kent
with
his
lids
dropped
over
the
keen
gaze
of
his
eyes
it
was
the
following
morning
that
the
unknown
body
was
found
on
the
beach
near
the
her
face
showed
no
comprehension
i
have
heard
nothing
of
any
body
she
replied
did
none
of
the
talk
come
to
your
ears
of
a
strange
woman
found
at
lonesome
cove
no
wait
though
after
the
funeral
one
of
the
cousins
began
to
speak
of
a
mystery
and
blair
shut
him
your
necklace
was
taken
from
that
her
eyes
grew
wide
was
she
the
thief
she
asked
eagerly
the
person
who
took
the
necklace
from
the
body
is
the
one
for
whom
i
am
searching
now
blair
will
you
tell
me
in
a
word
how
your
husband
met
his
death
her
gaze
did
not
falter
from
his
but
a
look
of
suffering
came
into
her
eyes
and
the
hands
in
her
lap
closed
and
opened
and
closed
again
perhaps
i
can
save
you
by
putting
it
in
another
form
your
gave
you
to
understand
did
he
not
that
wilfrid
blair
met
and
quarreled
a
certain
person
and
was
killed
in
the
encounter
which
followed
how
shall
i
ever
free
myself
from
the
consciousness
of
my
own
part
in
it
she
shuddered
don
t
speak
of
it
again
i
can
t
bear
you
won
t
have
to
very
long
kent
assured
her
let
us
get
back
to
the
jewels
you
would
be
willing
to
make
a
considerable
sacrifice
to
recover
them
anything
perhaps
you
ve
heard
something
of
this
man
drawing
a
newspaper
page
from
his
pocket
kent
indicated
an
advertisement
outlined
in
blue
pencil
it
was
elaborately
displayed
as
follows
fate
is
written
in
the
past
present
and
future
are
open
books
to
his
mystic
guided
aright
in
business
love
health
thousands
to
whom
he
has
pointed
out
the
way
of
the
stars
bless
him
for
his
aid
by
preston
jax
suite
mystic
block
royal
street
blair
glanced
at
the
announcement
some
of
my
friends
have
been
to
him
she
said
for
a
time
he
was
rather
a
but
you
haven
t
ever
consulted
him
yourself
no
that
is
well
i
want
you
to
go
there
with
me
to
that
charlatan
why
professor
kent
i
thought
you
were
a
scientific
translate
science
down
to
its
simplest
terms
in
saxon
english
said
kent
it
would
be
knowing
i
exactly
when
i
think
a
man
knows
something
which
i
wish
to
know
but
do
not
know
i
try
to
possess
myself
of
his
knowledge
whether
he
is
microscopist
astrologer
or
tinsmith
to
that
extent
i
am
a
and
you
expect
the
stars
to
tell
us
something
about
my
lost
topazes
they
seem
to
have
had
some
influence
on
the
career
of
the
original
owner
said
kent
with
his
half
smile
and
one
star
has
already
lighted
up
the
beginning
of
the
trail
for
i
can
t
understand
your
motives
she
said
but
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
when
do
you
wish
me
to
go
i
have
an
appointment
for
us
at
high
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
kent
and
blair
passed
from
the
broad
noonday
glare
of
the
street
into
the
tempered
darkness
of
a
strange
apartment
it
was
hung
about
with
black
cloths
and
lighted
by
the
effulgence
of
an
artificial
and
several
planets
contrived
kent
conjectured
of
isinglass
set
into
the
fabric
with
arc
lights
behind
them
a
servitor
clad
throughout
in
black
appeared
from
nowhere
provided
chairs
set
a
pitcher
of
water
beside
them
and
vanished
silently
a
faint
heavy
but
not
unpleasant
odor
as
of
incense
hovered
in
the
air
the
moon
waxed
slowly
in
brightness
illumining
the
two
figures
very
well
fixed
up
whispered
kent
to
his
companion
the
astrologer
is
now
looking
us
in
fact
at
that
moment
a
contemplating
and
estimating
eye
was
fixed
upon
them
from
a
dead
star
in
the
farther
wall
the
eye
beheld
a
girl
whose
delicate
but
vivid
loveliness
was
undimmed
by
the
grisly
trappings
of
mourning
which
a
christian
civilization
has
borrowed
from
barbarism
to
belie
its
own
christianity
withal
rested
a
moment
and
passed
with
more
of
scrutiny
to
her
companion
preston
jax
did
not
as
a
rule
receive
more
than
one
client
at
a
time
police
witnesses
travel
in
pairs
and
the
was
of
a
suspicious
nature
only
an
extraordinary
fee
and
the
cultured
languor
of
the
voice
which
requested
the
appointment
over
the
telephone
had
induced
him
to
relax
his
rule
now
however
his
uneasiness
was
appeased
he
beheld
a
gentleman
clad
in
such
apparel
as
never
police
spy
nor
investigating
agent
wore
a
rather
puzzling
swellness
the
term
is
culled
from
jax
s
envious
thoughts
since
it
appeared
to
be
individual
without
being
in
any
particular
conspicuous
jax
an
adept
in
extracting
information
wondered
if
he
could
persuade
the
visitor
to
disclose
his
tailor
to
the
stars
for
he
was
himself
in
light
vacational
moments
at
atlantic
city
and
in
the
something
of
a
dresser
one
point
however
the
connoisseurship
of
the
could
hardly
approve
the
monocle
displayed
in
his
visitor
s
left
eye
though
it
was
reassuring
to
his
professional
judgment
the
visitor
was
obviously
light
quitting
his
the
pressed
a
button
strains
of
music
soft
and
sourceless
filled
the
air
from
a
phonograph
muffled
in
rugs
the
moon
glow
paled
a
little
there
was
a
soft
rustle
and
fluctuation
of
wall
draperies
in
the
apartment
the
light
waxed
the
stood
before
his
visitors
they
beheld
a
man
of
undistinguished
size
and
form
eked
out
by
a
splendid
pomposity
of
manner
to
this
his
garb
contributed
all
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
had
lent
magnificence
to
the
long
black
loose
robe
with
gaping
sleeves
which
he
wore
blair
noted
with
vague
interest
that
it
was
all
hand
embroidered
pale
and
hard
the
face
rose
from
this
somber
and
gorgeous
appareling
it
was
a
remarkable
face
small
calm
and
compacted
of
muscles
muscles
plumped
out
the
broad
cheeks
muscles
curved
about
the
jaws
muscles
worked
delicately
along
the
club
of
a
nose
the
chin
was
just
one
live
twitching
muscle
even
the
faint
screwed
lines
at
the
suggested
muscle
and
withal
there
lurked
in
the
countenance
a
suggestion
of
ingenuousness
the
man
looked
like
a
bland
and
formidable
baby
he
looked
even
more
like
a
puma
with
a
rhythmical
motion
of
arms
and
hands
he
came
forward
performed
a
spreading
bow
of
welcome
and
drew
back
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
in
concentration
of
thought
marjorie
blair
felt
an
unholy
desire
to
laugh
she
glanced
at
professor
kent
and
to
her
surprise
found
him
exhibiting
every
evidence
of
discomposure
he
fidgeted
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
mopped
his
brow
and
palpably
flinched
under
the
solemn
regard
of
the
mage
stupid
of
me
he
muttered
in
apology
gets
on
one
s
nerves
you
know
awesome
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
fussing
with
the
preston
jax
bestowed
a
patronizing
smile
upon
his
visitor
protectiveness
benign
and
assured
radiated
from
him
fear
nothing
said
he
the
star
forces
respond
to
the
of
him
who
comprehends
them
madam
the
date
year
month
and
day
of
your
birth
if
you
please
march
replied
blair
propelled
by
an
unseen
force
a
celestial
globe
mounted
on
a
nickeled
standard
rolled
forth
the
spun
it
with
a
practised
hand
slowly
and
more
slowly
it
turned
until
as
it
came
to
a
stop
a
ray
of
light
mysteriously
appearing
focused
on
a
constellation
yonder
is
your
star
declared
the
astrologist
see
how
the
aural
light
seeks
oh
i
say
murmured
he
of
the
monocle
weird
you
know
quite
gets
on
one
s
nerves
quite
reproved
preston
jax
silence
is
the
fitting
medium
of
the
higher
stellar
mysteries
madam
your
life
is
a
pathway
between
happiness
and
grief
loss
like
a
speeding
comet
has
crossed
it
here
happiness
like
the
soft
moon
glow
has
beamed
upon
it
and
will
again
beam
in
fuller
with
beautifully
modulated
intonations
he
proceeded
while
one
of
his
visitors
regarded
him
with
awestruck
reverence
and
the
other
waited
with
unimpressed
so
the
orator
felt
by
his
gifts
his
voice
sank
by
gradations
into
silence
the
ray
winked
out
then
the
woman
spoke
is
it
possible
for
your
stars
to
guide
me
to
an
object
which
i
have
lost
nothing
is
hidden
from
the
stars
declared
their
master
their
radiance
shines
not
alone
upon
the
broad
expanses
of
existence
but
also
into
the
smallest
crevices
of
life
you
seek
jewels
madam
kent
had
let
this
much
out
as
if
by
accident
in
the
morning
s
conversation
your
birth
stone
is
the
bloodstone
unhappy
indeed
would
be
the
omen
if
you
lost
one
of
those
he
was
fishing
and
came
forward
toward
her
almost
brushing
kent
but
i
say
cried
kent
in
apparently
uncontrollable
agitation
did
your
stars
tell
you
that
she
had
lost
some
jewelry
tell
me
is
that
how
you
knew
illustration
how
the
aural
light
seeks
in
his
eagerness
he
caught
at
the
astrologer
s
arm
the
right
one
and
his
long
fingers
gathering
in
the
ample
folds
of
the
gown
pressed
nervously
upon
the
wrist
preston
jax
winced
away
all
the
excited
vapidity
passed
from
kent
s
speech
at
once
the
jewels
which
this
lady
has
lost
he
said
very
quietly
are
a
set
of
unique
i
fact
i
felt
that
you
could
with
or
without
the
aid
of
your
stars
help
her
to
recover
blackness
instant
and
impenetrable
was
the
answer
to
this
there
was
a
subdued
flowing
sound
of
drapery
as
if
some
one
were
brushing
along
the
wall
kent
raised
his
voice
the
merest
trifle
unless
you
wish
to
be
arrested
i
advise
you
not
to
leave
this
place
not
by
either
arrested
on
what
charge
came
out
of
the
darkness
i
didn
t
take
murder
my
god
so
abject
was
the
terror
and
misery
in
the
cry
that
kent
felt
sorry
for
the
wretch
then
with
a
certain
dogged
bitterness
i
don
t
care
what
you
know
i
didn
t
kill
that
is
very
likely
true
replied
kent
soothingly
but
it
is
what
i
must
know
in
detail
find
your
foot
lever
and
turn
on
the
the
two
visitors
could
hear
him
grope
heavily
as
the
light
flashed
on
they
saw
with
a
shock
that
he
was
on
all
fours
it
was
as
if
kent
s
word
had
felled
him
instantly
he
was
up
however
and
faced
around
upon
marjorie
blair
who
was
she
he
demanded
your
sister
blair
was
very
pale
but
her
eyes
were
steady
and
her
voice
under
control
as
she
answered
i
do
not
you
must
know
don
t
torture
me
i
m
a
rat
in
a
i
m
sorry
she
said
gently
that
i
can
t
help
you
but
i
do
not
you
the
turned
upon
kent
what
am
i
up
against
how
did
you
find
me
thrusting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
the
scientist
brought
out
a
little
patch
of
black
cloth
with
a
single
star
skilfully
embroidered
on
it
wild
blackberry
has
long
thorns
and
sharp
he
said
you
left
this
tatter
on
hawkill
at
the
name
the
man
s
chin
muscle
throbbed
with
his
effort
to
hold
his
teeth
steady
against
chattering
at
first
i
suspected
an
army
officer
when
i
found
that
the
cloth
was
below
grade
the
only
other
starred
profession
i
could
think
of
was
astrology
as
the
highest
class
astrologer
now
advertising
you
seemed
likely
to
be
the
man
when
i
found
first
that
you
were
out
of
town
on
july
fifth
and
just
now
by
a
somewhat
rough
experiment
that
you
had
suffered
a
wound
of
the
right
wrist
i
was
what
do
you
want
a
fair
exchange
my
name
is
chester
the
s
chin
worked
convulsively
the
kent
that
broke
up
the
coordinated
spiritism
circle
it
s
ill
bargaining
with
the
devil
observed
preston
jax
grimly
what
s
the
exchange
i
do
not
believe
that
you
are
guilty
of
murder
tell
me
the
whole
story
plainly
and
straight
and
i
ll
clear
you
in
so
far
as
i
can
believe
you
for
the
first
time
the
seer
s
chin
was
at
peace
you
want
me
to
begin
with
this
lady
s
necklace
why
yes
but
after
that
begin
at
the
the
topazes
are
cached
under
a
rock
near
the
cliff
i
couldn
t
direct
you
but
i
could
show
in
time
you
shall
one
moment
as
you
realize
you
are
under
presumption
of
murder
do
you
know
the
identity
of
the
victim
of
astræa
that
s
all
i
know
about
her
i
don
t
even
know
her
last
why
astræa
that
s
the
way
she
signed
herself
she
seemed
to
think
i
knew
all
about
her
without
being
and
you
played
up
to
that
belief
course
i
yes
you
naturally
would
but
if
you
had
no
name
to
write
to
how
could
you
answer
the
letters
through
personal
advertisements
she
had
made
out
a
code
she
was
a
smart
one
in
some
ways
i
can
tell
have
you
any
of
the
letters
here
only
the
last
bring
it
to
obediently
as
an
intimidated
child
the
astrologer
left
the
room
presently
returning
with
a
plain
sheet
of
paper
with
handwriting
on
one
side
kent
who
almost
never
made
a
mistake
had
forgotten
in
his
absorption
in
the
matter
of
the
document
the
presence
even
the
existence
of
marjorie
blair
he
was
recalled
to
himself
with
a
shock
as
he
felt
her
shoulder
touch
his
involuntarily
he
whirled
the
sheet
behind
him
let
me
see
the
rest
of
it
please
she
said
calmly
enough
kent
nodded
with
drooping
head
and
chin
the
master
of
stars
stood
studying
them
while
they
read
the
letter
together
it
was
in
two
handwritings
the
date
address
and
body
of
the
letter
being
in
a
clear
running
character
while
the
signature
astræa
was
in
very
fine
minute
detached
lettering
the
note
read
all
is
now
ready
you
have
but
to
carry
out
our
arrangements
implicitly
the
place
is
known
to
you
there
can
be
no
difficulty
in
your
finding
it
at
two
hours
after
sundown
of
july
the
fifth
we
shall
be
there
our
ship
will
be
in
waiting
all
will
be
as
before
fail
me
not
your
reward
shall
be
greater
than
you
dream
kent
looked
askance
at
blair
she
was
very
white
and
her
sensitive
lips
quivered
a
little
but
she
contrived
with
an
effort
of
courage
which
he
marked
with
a
flashing
access
of
admiration
to
smile
reassuringly
don
t
fear
for
me
she
said
we
dorrances
are
of
firm
so
i
see
he
said
warmly
he
folded
and
pocketed
the
letter
had
you
ever
been
to
this
place
before
kent
asked
of
jax
then
how
did
you
expect
to
find
it
she
sent
me
a
map
i
lost
what
about
the
ship
i
wish
you
d
tell
there
wasn
t
any
ship
that
i
could
and
the
reference
to
all
being
as
it
was
before
you
ve
got
me
again
there
in
most
every
letter
there
was
something
about
things
i
didn
t
understand
she
seemed
to
think
we
used
to
know
each
other
maybe
we
did
hundreds
of
em
come
to
me
i
can
t
remember
em
all
sometimes
she
called
me
hermann
my
name
ain
t
hermann
right
up
to
the
time
i
saw
her
on
the
heights
i
was
afraid
she
was
taking
me
for
somebody
else
and
that
the
whole
game
would
be
queered
as
soon
as
we
came
face
to
it
seems
quite
probable
said
kent
with
a
faint
smile
that
you
were
taken
for
some
one
else
your
personal
appearance
would
hardly
betray
the
error
well
if
i
was
taken
for
another
man
said
the
puzzled
astrologist
why
didn
t
she
say
so
when
she
saw
me
what
did
she
say
when
she
saw
you
why
she
seemed
just
as
tickled
to
set
eyes
on
me
as
if
i
were
her
hermann
twice
exactly
replied
kent
with
satisfaction
well
how
do
you
account
for
that
passing
over
the
query
the
other
proceeded
now
as
i
understand
it
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
what
else
can
i
do
cried
preston
jax
nothing
that
would
be
so
wise
so
do
not
try
i
shall
want
you
to
come
to
martindale
center
on
call
pack
up
and
be
but
the
police
quavered
jax
you
said
the
place
was
guarded
and
i
d
be
pinched
if
i
tried
to
get
oh
no
retorted
kent
with
a
smile
that
wouldn
t
have
been
true
and
i
never
lie
you
inferred
that
and
wrongly
from
my
little
ruse
to
keep
you
from
running
away
that
you
would
be
arrested
eventually
if
you
attempted
escape
was
true
it
still
is
i
believe
it
replied
preston
jax
fervently
with
you
on
my
come
blair
said
kent
remember
jax
fair
play
and
we
shall
pull
you
through
in
the
taxi
marjorie
blair
turned
to
kent
you
are
a
very
wonderful
person
she
shook
his
and
i
think
a
very
kind
kent
shook
his
head
again
be
kind
to
me
and
leave
me
to
go
home
kent
stopped
the
cab
stepped
out
and
raised
his
hat
she
leaned
toward
him
just
a
moment
she
said
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
ask
but
it
is
too
strong
for
me
will
you
tell
me
who
the
woman
was
kent
fell
back
a
step
his
eyes
widening
you
don
t
see
it
yet
he
asked
not
a
glimmer
of
light
unless
she
was
unacknowledged
member
of
the
no
not
and
you
can
t
tell
me
who
she
was
yes
but
not
just
now
try
to
be
patient
for
a
little
very
well
your
judgment
is
best
doubtless
of
course
you
know
whose
hand
wrote
the
body
of
that
letter
yes
try
not
to
think
of
it
advised
kent
it
isn
t
nearly
so
ugly
as
it
she
looked
at
him
with
her
straight
fearless
wistful
glance
he
had
left
me
nothing
to
love
she
said
sadly
but
to
find
disgrace
and
shame
even
to
the
end
of
his
life
that
is
hard
that
it
should
have
been
my
husband
who
gave
the
thing
most
precious
to
me
to
another
woman
but
why
did
he
write
the
letter
to
preston
jax
for
her
to
sign
chester
kent
shook
his
head
chapter
strange
tryst
midnight
found
kent
in
the
throes
of
literary
effort
he
was
striving
to
compose
a
letter
to
sedgwick
that
should
in
turn
compose
the
recipient
s
perturbed
feelings
it
concluded
with
some
acerbity
you
ve
made
a
pretty
complete
idiot
of
yourself
once
don
t
try
to
eclipse
your
own
by
which
he
purposed
to
convey
to
the
artist
the
fact
that
his
presence
in
boston
was
neither
desirable
nor
advisable
as
he
was
about
to
affix
his
signature
a
knock
brought
him
to
the
door
of
his
hotel
room
letter
for
you
announced
the
messenger
boy
kent
signed
the
book
and
received
a
broad
thin
envelope
sealed
in
golden
hued
wax
with
the
impress
of
a
star
and
addressed
in
typewriting
to
his
own
name
confound
all
fools
who
sign
their
letters
on
the
outside
said
kent
scowling
at
the
seal
what
has
that
planetary
lunatic
got
to
say
that
won
t
keep
what
preston
jax
had
to
say
was
first
in
the
form
of
a
very
brief
note
secondly
in
the
shape
of
a
document
the
note
began
esteemed
sir
concluded
yours
remorsefully
and
set
forth
in
somewhat
exotic
language
that
the
writer
fearing
a
lapse
of
courage
that
might
confuse
his
narrative
when
he
should
come
to
give
it
had
taken
pen
in
hand
to
commit
it
to
writing
and
would
the
recipient
kindly
pardon
haste
therewith
typed
pages
haste
cried
chester
kent
grievously
why
he
s
written
me
the
story
of
his
life
indeed
at
a
cursory
glance
it
appeared
so
the
initial
paragraph
opened
i
was
born
of
poor
but
honest
chester
kent
groaned
a
little
farther
down
the
page
the
phrase
oh
that
those
innocent
days
of
my
happy
childhood
might
return
rose
and
smote
him
in
the
eyes
chester
kent
snorted
a
desperate
leap
landed
him
in
the
midst
of
page
five
where
he
encountered
this
gem
with
these
fateful
words
the
kind
old
minister
laid
a
faltering
hand
upon
my
head
but
enough
quite
enough
agreed
chester
kent
and
kicked
the
s
document
into
a
corner
it
fell
in
a
crumpled
heap
with
one
sheet
curving
in
upward
protuberance
conspicuous
to
the
eye
on
this
sheet
there
was
handwriting
and
the
handwriting
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
note
marjorie
blair
had
identified
kent
retrieved
the
paper
laid
it
on
his
desk
selected
a
likely
spot
for
one
more
plunge
and
dived
into
the
turbid
flood
of
words
and
behold
as
he
turned
so
to
speak
the
corner
of
the
narrative
the
current
became
suddenly
clear
the
muddled
eloquence
fell
away
and
the
style
crystallized
into
the
tense
quick
testimony
of
the
prime
actor
in
a
drama
intensely
and
shudderingly
felt
the
reader
ran
through
it
with
increasing
absorption
then
pencil
in
hand
he
attacked
the
first
part
of
the
precious
screed
and
emerged
from
a
scene
of
literary
carnage
with
one
brief
paragraph
in
hand
and
the
slaughtered
bodies
of
many
eloquent
pages
strewing
the
floor
that
one
paragraph
stated
that
preston
jax
whose
real
name
was
john
preston
had
after
a
rebellious
boyhood
run
away
to
sea
lived
two
years
before
the
mast
picked
up
a
smattering
of
education
been
assistant
and
capper
for
a
magnetic
healer
and
had
finally
formulated
a
system
of
astrological
prophecy
that
won
him
a
slow
but
increasing
renown
the
gist
of
the
system
was
to
assign
some
particular
and
often
imaginary
star
to
every
subject
and
by
a
natural
aptitude
for
worming
out
secrets
from
the
credulous
lead
them
along
the
celestial
paths
of
mysticism
to
a
point
where
he
could
reach
their
pocketbooks
he
had
been
specially
successful
with
women
one
bit
of
his
philosophy
kent
had
preserved
unaltered
they
bite
slower
than
men
but
when
they
do
take
hold
they
swallow
the
hook
so
deep
that
you
re
lucky
to
get
it
back
at
an
hour
s
work
with
a
pencil
that
should
have
been
blue
resolved
the
document
under
kent
s
skilful
and
remorseless
editorship
into
its
salient
elements
obviously
it
was
impossible
to
put
it
into
alien
hands
for
copying
kent
ordered
up
a
typewriter
and
copied
it
himself
the
duplicate
he
enclosed
in
his
letter
to
sedgwick
the
original
he
put
aside
to
sleep
upon
thus
it
ran
this
astræa
affair
looked
good
from
the
first
so
began
preston
jax
s
confession
as
beheaded
and
stripped
down
by
its
editor
it
looked
like
one
of
the
best
you
could
smell
money
in
it
with
half
a
nose
she
bit
first
on
one
of
the
occult
number
four
of
the
old
series
a
with
display
in
italics
and
leaded
out
strong
that
ad
always
was
a
good
her
first
letter
came
in
on
a
monday
i
recollect
it
was
a
big
mail
there
were
a
lot
of
curiositys
and
a
couple
of
suspiciouses
and
this
was
one
of
half
a
dozen
in
the
true
believers
pile
irene
my
assistant
had
put
the
red
pencil
on
it
when
she
sorted
out
the
mail
to
show
it
was
something
special
but
don
t
get
her
into
this
professor
kent
if
you
do
it
s
all
off
jewels
and
all
irene
has
always
been
for
the
straight
star
business
and
forecast
game
and
no
extras
or
side
lines
besides
we
were
married
last
week
what
attracted
irene
s
red
pencil
and
caught
me
right
away
was
the
style
of
the
thing
the
handwriting
was
classy
the
paper
was
elegant
there
was
something
rich
about
it
all
this
was
no
biddy
pinching
out
the
missis
stationery
to
make
a
play
with
she
quoted
poetry
swell
poetry
first
off
she
signed
herself
an
adept
i
gave
her
the
personal
no
and
followed
it
up
with
the
special
friendly
no
irene
never
liked
that
no
she
says
it
s
spoony
just
the
same
it
fetches
them
but
not
this
one
she
began
to
get
personal
and
all
right
and
answered
up
with
the
racket
but
come
to
boston
not
a
move
said
she
couldn
t
there
were
reasons
it
looked
like
the
old
wife
and
jealous
husband
nothing
in
that
game
unless
you
go
in
for
the
straight
holdup
and
blackmail
was
always
too
strong
for
my
taste
so
i
did
the
natural
thing
gave
her
special
readings
and
doubled
on
the
price
she
paid
like
a
lamb
then
blame
if
it
didn
t
slip
out
she
wasn
t
married
at
all
i
lost
that
letter
it
was
kind
of
endearing
irene
put
up
a
howl
it
was
getting
too
personal
for
her
taste
i
told
her
i
would
cut
it
out
then
i
gave
my
swell
lady
another
address
and
wrote
her
for
a
picture
nothing
doing
but
she
began
to
hint
around
at
a
meeting
one
day
a
letter
came
with
a
bill
in
it
loose
too
just
like
you
or
me
might
send
a
stamp
for
expenses
she
wrote
and
i
was
to
come
at
once
our
souls
had
returned
to
recognize
and
join
each
other
she
said
here
is
the
only
part
of
the
letter
i
could
dig
up
from
the
waste
basket
here
the
specimen
of
handwriting
that
had
caught
kent
s
eye
was
pasted
upon
the
document
you
have
pointed
out
to
me
that
our
stars
swinging
in
mighty
circles
are
rushing
on
to
a
joint
climax
together
we
may
force
open
the
doors
to
the
past
and
sway
the
world
as
we
sought
to
do
in
bygone
and
so
on
and
cetera
continued
the
narrative
well
of
course
she
was
nutty
that
is
about
the
star
business
but
that
don
t
prove
anything
the
dippiest
i
ever
worked
was
the
head
of
a
department
in
one
of
the
big
stores
and
the
fiercest
little
business
woman
in
business
hours
you
ever
knew
it
s
the
romantic
in
the
sex
that
sets
them
skidding
when
it
comes
to
stars
and
such
like
and
astræa
was
not
a
patch
on
some
of
them
that
has
been
paying
me
good
sane
money
for
years
that
was
the
letter
she
first
called
me
hermann
in
and
signed
astræa
to
said
there
was
no
use
pretending
to
conceal
her
identity
any
longer
from
me
seemed
to
think
i
knew
all
about
it
that
jarred
me
some
and
with
the
change
of
writing
in
the
signature
it
all
looked
pretty
queer
you
remember
the
last
letter
with
the
name
at
the
bottom
well
they
all
came
that
way
after
this
the
body
of
the
letter
very
bold
and
careless
signature
written
in
an
entirely
different
hand
i
took
it
to
chorio
the
and
he
said
so
too
what
s
more
he
advised
me
to
quit
the
game
said
there
was
trouble
back
of
that
handwriting
those
character
fellows
ain
t
such
fools
either
but
bills
loose
in
letters
mean
a
big
stake
i
wrote
her
i
would
come
and
i
signed
it
hermann
just
to
play
up
to
her
lead
irene
got
on
and
threw
a
fit
she
said
her
woman
s
intuition
told
her
there
was
danger
in
it
truth
is
she
was
stuck
on
me
herself
and
i
was
on
her
but
we
did
not
find
it
out
until
after
the
crash
so
i
was
all
for
prying
astræa
loose
from
her
money
if
i
had
to
marry
her
to
do
it
she
wrote
some
slush
about
the
one
desperate
plunge
together
and
then
the
glory
that
was
to
be
ours
that
looked
like
marriage
to
me
you
saw
the
last
letter
it
had
me
rattled
but
not
rattled
enough
to
quit
there
was
a
map
in
it
of
the
place
for
the
meeting
that
was
plain
enough
but
the
our
and
we
business
in
it
bothered
me
it
looked
a
bit
like
a
third
person
i
had
not
heard
anything
about
any
third
person
what
is
more
i
did
not
have
any
use
for
a
third
person
in
this
business
the
stars
forbade
it
i
wrote
and
told
her
so
and
said
if
there
was
any
outsider
rung
in
the
stellar
courses
would
have
a
sudden
change
of
heart
then
i
put
my
best
robe
in
a
bag
and
bought
a
ticket
for
carr
s
junction
you
can
believe
that
while
i
was
going
through
the
woods
i
was
keeping
a
bright
eye
out
for
any
third
party
well
he
was
not
there
not
when
i
arrived
anyway
where
he
was
all
the
time
i
do
not
know
i
never
saw
him
but
i
heard
him
later
i
can
hear
him
yet
at
night
god
help
me
she
was
leaning
against
a
little
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
thicket
when
i
first
saw
her
there
was
plenty
of
light
from
the
moon
and
it
sifted
down
through
the
trees
and
fell
across
her
head
and
neck
as
neat
a
bit
of
for
my
business
as
i
could
have
fixed
up
myself
and
i
am
some
hand
at
that
you
have
seen
my
place
and
you
know
i
noticed
a
queer
circlet
around
her
neck
the
stones
were
like
soft
pink
fires
i
had
not
ever
seen
any
like
them
before
and
i
stood
there
trying
to
figure
whether
they
were
rubies
and
how
much
they
might
be
worth
while
i
was
wondering
about
it
she
half
turned
and
i
got
my
first
good
look
at
her
face
she
was
younger
than
i
had
reckoned
on
and
not
bad
to
look
at
but
queer
queer
something
about
her
struck
me
all
wrong
gave
me
a
sort
of
ugly
shiver
another
thing
struck
me
all
right
though
that
was
that
she
had
jewels
on
pretty
much
all
her
fingers
in
one
of
my
letters
to
her
i
gave
her
a
hint
about
that
told
her
that
gems
gave
the
stars
a
stronger
hold
on
the
wearer
and
she
had
taken
it
all
in
she
certainly
was
an
easy
subject
a
bundle
done
up
in
paper
was
on
the
ground
near
her
i
ducked
back
very
still
and
got
into
my
robe
the
arrangement
in
her
letter
was
for
me
to
whistle
when
i
got
there
i
whistled
she
straightened
up
come
she
said
i
am
her
voice
was
rather
deep
and
soft
but
it
wasn
t
a
pleasant
softness
some
way
i
did
not
like
it
any
better
than
i
liked
her
looks
it
was
too
late
to
back
out
though
i
stepped
out
into
the
open
and
gave
her
the
grand
bow
the
master
of
the
stars
at
your
command
i
said
you
are
not
as
i
expected
to
see
you
she
said
that
was
a
sticker
it
might
mean
most
anything
i
took
a
chance
oh
well
i
said
we
all
it
went
we
change
as
life
changes
she
said
they
never
found
you
did
they
from
the
way
she
said
it
i
saw
she
expected
me
to
say
no
so
i
said
no
that
was
left
for
me
to
return
and
do
she
went
on
with
a
kind
of
queer
joy
that
gave
me
the
shivers
again
yes
i
agreed
wishing
i
knew
what
she
was
driving
at
but
sticking
to
my
text
and
here
we
together
says
she
isn
t
it
wonderful
after
all
these
years
the
instant
i
saw
your
statement
in
the
newspaper
i
knew
it
was
your
soul
calling
to
mine
across
the
you
know
professor
kent
i
thought
that
was
so
good
i
made
a
note
of
it
for
future
business
use
while
i
was
saying
it
over
to
myself
she
gave
me
a
jar
our
boat
is
at
the
shore
she
said
in
that
last
letter
she
mentioned
a
ship
and
now
here
was
this
boat
business
afterward
i
looked
for
a
sign
of
either
but
could
not
find
any
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
explain
the
other
part
of
the
we
and
our
if
i
was
going
to
elope
by
sea
i
wanted
to
know
it
and
i
said
as
much
are
you
steadfast
she
asked
well
there
was
only
one
answer
to
that
i
said
i
was
she
opened
her
package
and
took
out
a
coil
of
rope
it
was
this
rope
sort
of
and
it
looked
strong
what
now
i
asked
her
to
bind
us
together
she
said
close
close
together
and
then
the
plunge
this
time
there
shall
be
no
failure
they
shall
not
find
one
of
us
without
the
other
you
are
not
afraid
afraid
my
neck
was
bristling
the
woman
was
proposing
as
near
as
i
could
make
out
that
we
go
out
in
a
boat
tie
ourselves
together
and
jump
overboard
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
an
encore
to
some
previous
performance
go
slow
i
said
thinking
mighty
hard
i
don
t
quite
see
the
point
of
all
all
is
as
it
is
foreordained
in
the
stars
the
curve
of
the
astral
courses
the
illimitable
unchangeable
curve
that
has
made
us
what
we
are
and
shall
draw
us
on
and
on
to
our
mighty
destiny
you
you
have
pointed
out
the
that
is
what
she
gave
me
waving
her
arms
in
the
air
didn
t
i
curse
myself
for
not
remembering
what
i
had
written
her
no
clue
except
that
the
poor
soul
was
plumb
dippy
for
me
to
marry
at
any
price
it
wouldn
t
have
held
in
the
courts
yet
there
might
have
been
five
thousand
dollars
of
diamonds
on
her
it
was
a
tight
place
i
wanted
to
duck
the
whole
thing
but
the
rings
held
me
i
have
always
been
dotty
about
diamonds
i
suppose
she
felt
me
weakening
women
are
queer
that
way
you
dare
to
break
our
pact
she
says
in
a
voice
like
a
woman
on
the
stage
then
she
changed
and
spoke
very
gently
you
are
looking
at
these
gewgaws
she
said
and
took
a
diamond
circlet
from
her
finger
what
do
these
count
for
and
she
put
it
in
my
hand
another
ring
dropped
at
my
feet
mind
she
was
giving
them
to
me
i
do
not
know
if
it
would
hold
in
law
she
being
a
lunatic
but
i
was
going
to
take
all
i
could
on
the
chance
and
watch
for
a
getaway
the
diamonds
had
me
hypnotized
these
are
as
nothing
compared
to
what
we
shall
have
she
went
on
after
the
plunge
wait
she
had
dropped
the
rope
and
now
she
went
into
her
paper
parcel
again
kneeling
at
my
side
i
had
stooped
to
look
for
the
fallen
ring
when
i
felt
her
hand
slide
up
my
wrist
and
then
a
quick
little
snap
of
something
cold
and
close
a
bracelet
i
thought
and
it
was
a
bracelet
forever
together
she
said
and
stood
up
beside
me
chained
to
me
by
the
handcuffs
she
had
slipped
on
my
right
wrist
and
her
left
never
you
think
your
nerve
is
sound
till
you
have
felt
something
like
that
i
thought
mine
i
squalled
aloud
like
a
child
at
a
ghost
hush
she
said
and
her
free
arm
pressed
across
my
mouth
how
much
to
let
me
off
i
asked
as
soon
as
i
could
get
breath
you
see
it
flashed
on
me
that
it
was
a
trap
you
can
never
tell
in
our
line
when
the
detectives
may
be
after
you
or
what
kind
of
a
game
they
ll
put
up
i
looked
around
for
the
rest
of
the
bunch
to
come
and
jump
me
but
i
didn
t
see
a
thing
her
next
words
put
me
on
the
stars
the
stars
she
whispered
see
ours
how
they
light
our
pathway
across
the
sea
the
sea
that
awaits
us
more
breath
came
back
to
me
it
wasn
t
a
trap
then
she
was
only
a
crazy
woman
that
i
had
to
get
rid
of
i
looked
down
at
the
handcuff
it
was
of
iron
and
had
dull
rusted
edges
a
hammer
would
have
made
short
work
of
it
but
i
did
not
have
any
hammer
i
did
not
even
have
a
stone
there
would
be
stones
in
the
broken
land
beyond
the
thicket
i
thought
i
saw
a
way
yes
let
s
go
i
said
we
set
out
at
the
edge
of
the
thicket
was
a
flattish
rock
with
small
stones
near
it
here
i
pretended
to
slip
i
fell
with
my
right
wrist
across
a
rock
and
caught
up
a
cobblestone
with
my
left
hand
at
the
first
crack
of
the
stone
on
the
handcuff
i
could
feel
the
old
iron
weaken
i
got
no
chance
for
a
second
blow
her
hands
were
at
my
throat
they
bit
in
then
i
knew
it
was
a
fight
for
my
life
she
was
light
but
she
was
strong
like
a
panther
if
her
dress
bound
her
i
was
as
bad
off
in
my
robe
at
the
first
grip
i
was
forced
back
into
a
bush
and
sprawled
there
in
a
tangle
of
branches
and
flying
cloth
somehow
i
twisted
her
fingers
from
my
throat
we
struggled
out
into
the
moonlight
again
i
got
a
fair
look
at
her
face
and
i
guess
i
went
mad
myself
with
the
terror
of
it
the
next
thing
i
remember
clearly
she
was
quiet
on
the
ground
and
i
was
hammering
hammering
hammering
at
my
wrist
with
a
stone
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
her
blood
or
mine
both
maybe
for
my
wrist
was
like
pulp
when
the
iron
finally
cracked
open
and
i
was
free
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
blood
on
her
temple
i
suppose
i
had
hit
her
there
with
the
stone
she
looked
dead
all
i
wanted
was
to
think
how
could
i
think
with
her
lying
there
i
crept
out
of
sight
of
her
and
kneeled
down
her
star
the
star
i
had
faked
for
hers
was
shining
in
my
eyes
like
a
cold
glare
that
very
minute
a
wisp
of
cloud
blew
across
and
wiped
it
out
and
i
heard
myself
squeal
again
i
was
pretty
much
dotty
i
guess
while
i
was
trying
to
think
she
came
alive
she
didn
t
stir
slow
and
moan
like
i
have
seen
men
in
my
sea
days
when
they
were
knocked
out
she
was
on
her
feet
before
i
knew
it
and
off
at
a
dead
run
the
broken
handcuff
went
jerking
and
jumping
around
her
as
she
ran
that
was
an
awful
night
full
of
awful
things
but
the
one
worst
sight
of
even
than
the
finding
of
her
that
mad
figure
leaping
over
the
broken
ground
toward
the
cliff
s
edge
even
if
i
had
tried
to
follow
i
never
could
have
caught
her
and
she
was
going
straight
for
her
death
she
dropped
down
out
of
sight
into
a
hollow
and
came
up
on
the
rise
beyond
i
yelled
to
her
to
stop
for
god
s
sake
to
stop
then
i
held
my
breath
to
listen
for
her
scream
when
she
went
over
i
never
heard
it
but
i
heard
something
else
i
heard
a
man
s
voice
it
was
clear
and
strong
and
high
there
was
death
in
it
i
tell
you
kent
living
horror
gripped
at
the
throat
that
gave
that
cry
then
there
was
a
rush
of
little
stones
and
gravel
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
that
was
all
beyond
me
the
ground
rose
i
ran
up
on
it
it
gave
me
a
clear
view
of
the
i
thought
sure
i
would
see
the
man
who
had
cried
out
from
there
not
a
sight
of
him
nothing
moved
in
the
moonlight
i
thought
he
must
have
gone
over
the
cliff
too
i
threw
myself
down
and
buried
my
face
how
long
i
lay
on
the
ground
i
do
not
know
the
wisp
of
cloud
had
blotted
out
the
woman
s
star
now
and
by
that
i
knew
she
was
dead
but
the
moon
was
shining
high
it
gave
me
light
enough
to
see
my
way
into
the
gully
and
i
stumbled
and
slid
down
through
to
the
beach
i
found
her
body
right
away
it
lay
with
the
head
against
a
rock
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
man
s
body
the
man
who
had
yelled
so
i
thought
perhaps
he
had
not
gone
over
the
cliff
and
i
sat
and
waited
to
see
if
he
would
come
and
care
for
her
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
what
i
must
do
if
he
did
not
come
perhaps
my
own
brain
was
queer
from
the
shock
and
the
beating
she
had
given
me
with
her
manacled
wrist
but
i
felt
that
before
i
went
away
from
there
i
must
conceal
the
cause
of
her
death
and
everything
about
it
that
i
could
if
it
was
known
how
she
was
killed
they
would
be
more
likely
to
suspect
me
i
went
back
and
got
the
rope
i
got
an
old
grating
from
the
shore
i
dragged
the
body
into
the
sea
and
let
it
soak
i
lashed
it
to
the
grating
i
stripped
the
jewelry
from
her
but
i
could
not
take
it
that
would
have
made
me
a
murderer
there
is
a
rock
in
the
gully
that
i
marked
nobody
else
would
ever
notice
it
under
it
i
hid
the
jewelry
i
can
take
you
to
it
and
i
will
i
got
on
my
coat
and
sunk
my
robe
in
a
creek
and
got
myself
to
the
railroad
station
for
a
morning
train
and
when
i
got
home
i
married
irene
and
i
am
through
with
the
crooked
work
forever
this
is
the
whole
truth
i
did
not
kill
her
i
do
not
know
who
or
what
she
is
i
have
looked
in
the
papers
and
there
is
nothing
and
that
is
so
strange
that
i
would
think
it
was
all
a
fearful
dream
if
it
was
not
for
my
wrist
but
if
any
human
being
knows
more
about
the
death
of
astræa
it
must
be
the
man
who
shouted
as
she
fell
from
the
cliff
and
who
went
away
and
did
not
come
back
and
may
god
have
no
mercy
for
me
if
this
is
not
all
a
true
statement
so
far
as
i
know
the
truth
signed
chapter
the
white
room
july
hotel
martindale
center
dust
and
send
up
seven
chairs
now
i
wonder
what
that
might
mean
mused
the
of
the
eyrie
as
he
read
the
telegram
through
for
the
second
time
convention
in
the
room
of
mystery
maybe
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
he
went
up
to
the
room
himself
its
white
bareness
confirmed
a
suspicion
of
long
standing
any
man
he
remarked
to
the
scrub
woman
who
would
pay
five
a
day
for
a
room
just
to
put
nothing
at
all
in
it
has
sure
got
a
kink
in
his
nor
did
the
personnel
of
the
visitors
who
in
course
of
the
late
afternoon
arrived
with
requests
to
be
shown
to
serve
to
efface
this
impression
first
came
the
sheriff
from
annalaka
he
was
followed
by
a
man
of
unmistakably
african
derivation
who
gave
the
name
of
jim
and
declined
to
identify
himself
more
specifically
while
the
clerk
was
endeavoring
with
signal
lack
of
success
to
pump
him
lawyer
adam
bain
arrived
and
so
emphatically
vouched
for
his
predecessor
as
to
leave
the
no
further
excuse
for
obstructive
tactics
shortly
afterward
alexander
blair
came
in
with
a
woman
heavily
veiled
and
was
deferentially
conducted
aloft
finally
chester
kent
himself
appeared
accompanied
by
sedgwick
and
a
third
man
unknown
to
the
clerk
pompously
arrayed
in
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
and
characterized
by
a
painfully
twitching
chin
who
have
come
kent
asked
the
clerk
that
functionary
ran
over
the
list
looks
like
something
to
do
with
the
woman
found
in
lonesome
cove
last
week
he
essayed
hopefully
kent
glanced
out
of
the
window
it
looks
like
rain
he
observed
and
it
looks
like
wind
and
it
looks
like
a
number
of
things
that
are
anybody
s
business
furthermore
i
may
mention
that
we
shall
not
need
in
stationery
casual
messages
or
any
other
form
of
he
favored
the
wilting
clerk
with
a
sunny
smile
and
led
his
companions
to
the
elevator
sedgwick
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
the
woman
with
blair
he
asked
under
his
breath
kent
nodded
i
rather
hoped
that
she
wouldn
t
come
he
said
blair
might
better
have
told
far
as
he
then
he
doesn
t
know
all
no
and
perhaps
she
would
be
content
with
nothing
else
it
is
her
right
and
she
is
a
brave
woman
is
marjorie
blair
as
jax
here
can
testify
we
have
seen
her
under
she
is
that
confirmed
the
man
with
the
twitching
chin
this
then
is
the
final
asked
sedgwick
final
and
thank
god
it
will
be
a
weight
off
my
off
many
shoulders
said
kent
here
we
greetings
among
the
little
group
so
strangely
and
harshly
thrown
together
by
the
of
the
hand
of
circumstance
were
brief
and
formal
only
preston
jax
was
named
by
kent
with
the
comment
that
his
story
would
be
forthcoming
the
seven
guests
seated
themselves
the
blairs
at
one
end
of
the
sedgwick
and
the
astrologer
at
the
other
kent
leaning
against
the
wall
fumbled
uncertainly
at
his
ear
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
he
said
his
eyes
roving
along
the
intent
line
not
that
the
case
isn
t
perfectly
clear
but
there
are
certain
startling
phases
he
glanced
toward
the
blairs
marjorie
blair
smiled
bravely
at
him
don
t
be
alarmed
for
me
professor
kent
she
said
what
i
most
want
is
to
have
everything
cleared
first
your
jewels
kent
turned
to
preston
jax
who
handed
him
a
package
opening
it
kent
displayed
the
wonderful
grosvenor
with
a
miscellaneous
lot
of
rings
sparkling
amid
their
coils
with
a
cry
marjorie
caught
up
the
necklace
are
all
the
remainder
of
the
lost
valuables
there
blair
asked
kent
she
glanced
carelessly
at
the
rings
i
think
so
yes
but
this
is
what
matters
to
these
are
all
that
preston
jax
found
on
the
alexander
blair
leaned
from
his
seat
the
better
to
take
preston
jax
at
the
other
end
of
the
crescent
under
consideration
it
was
you
who
found
the
body
he
demanded
yes
said
the
astrologer
uneasily
were
you
alone
when
you
found
it
yes
no
i
don
t
know
there
was
a
man
somewheres
near
i
heard
him
but
i
never
saw
was
francis
sedgwick
with
you
that
night
pursued
blair
in
measured
tones
i
never
saw
sedgwick
until
there
was
a
little
soft
sigh
of
relief
from
where
marjorie
blair
sat
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
said
alexander
blair
sternly
it
is
the
word
of
a
man
who
has
robbed
a
dead
body
if
indeed
he
did
not
also
steady
blair
broke
in
chester
kent
perhaps
considering
who
is
present
we
would
better
approach
this
in
a
somewhat
calmer
i
didn
t
kill
or
rob
any
the
words
seemed
to
be
jerked
out
from
between
preston
jax
s
teeth
by
the
spasmodic
quiverings
of
his
chin
how
came
you
by
my
daughter
s
jewels
then
if
you
did
not
take
them
from
the
body
who
ever
said
i
didn
t
take
em
from
the
body
retorted
the
other
i
did
take
em
but
it
wasn
t
robbery
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
did
they
come
to
be
on
the
body
anyhow
what
was
that
astræa
woman
doing
with
your
daughter
s
rings
and
necklace
tell
me
that
wait
a
moment
put
in
kent
explain
to
blair
jax
what
your
purpose
was
in
taking
the
to
hide
em
i
thought
the
less
there
was
on
the
body
to
identify
it
the
better
chance
i
d
have
of
getting
away
i
was
so
scared
that
i
guess
i
was
half
crazy
anyway
and
now
i
hear
she
never
has
been
identified
is
that
right
sheriff
schlager
half
rose
from
his
chair
ain
t
you
told
em
professor
kent
kent
shook
his
head
nor
you
blair
then
i
don
t
see
why
we
can
t
keep
it
amongst
ourselves
said
the
sheriff
gansett
jim
s
tight
as
a
clam
nobody
ll
ever
get
anything
out
of
him
and
lord
knows
the
less
that
s
known
of
it
the
better
i
m
suited
i
ain
t
none
too
proud
of
my
part
in
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
ever
be
known
outside
of
this
room
said
kent
and
at
the
words
alexander
blair
exhaled
a
breath
of
relief
but
it
is
due
to
one
person
here
that
she
should
know
everything
the
question
is
how
to
make
it
clear
in
the
best
kindest
if
it
will
make
it
easier
for
any
one
here
to
speak
said
marjorie
blair
i
can
say
that
i
understand
certain
phases
of
my
husband
s
past
life
thoroughly
there
is
no
need
to
spare
me
on
that
but
this
pertains
to
a
phase
that
you
do
not
understand
at
yes
i
think
so
she
persisted
gently
this
dead
woman
had
some
hold
over
my
husband
to
maintain
it
she
came
to
live
near
hedgerow
house
and
while
she
was
blackmailing
wilfrid
she
got
into
communication
with
perhaps
they
were
in
collusion
suggested
lawyer
bain
oh
no
no
broke
in
alexander
blair
impatiently
you
re
wide
of
the
i
understand
persisted
the
young
woman
that
the
woman
persuaded
or
compelled
wilfrid
to
write
the
letter
to
jax
which
she
signed
astræa
and
that
when
she
went
to
keep
the
rendezvous
she
took
my
jewels
which
i
suppose
she
forced
poor
wilfrid
to
steal
for
her
am
i
not
right
professor
kent
no
far
from
why
not
cried
sedgwick
eagerly
she
certainly
had
the
jewels
on
when
she
met
me
and
the
handcuffs
must
have
been
in
the
bundle
i
heard
them
exactly
the
handcuffs
said
kent
dryly
what
use
to
your
mind
would
a
woman
of
that
sort
have
for
manacles
in
those
circumstances
yes
put
in
adam
bain
they
fit
in
about
as
nice
as
a
pink
silk
hat
at
a
i
know
what
use
she
had
for
em
muttered
preston
jax
caressing
his
wrist
it
s
simply
a
case
of
crazy
woman
isn
t
it
professor
kent
no
not
if
you
mean
that
your
assailant
was
a
crazy
woman
said
kent
patiently
then
who
in
heaven
s
name
is
or
was
astræa
cried
sedgwick
astræa
is
i
take
it
a
lady
long
since
dead
a
very
strange
and
interesting
lady
who
adopted
that
name
for
her
own
peculiar
pursuits
along
our
friend
jax
s
lines
of
they
call
themselves
all
sorts
of
things
observed
the
astrologer
philosophically
i
had
a
follower
once
that
used
to
sign
herself
carrie
nation
and
she
wasn
t
the
real
carrie
at
all
no
name
is
sacred
to
em
when
they
go
dippy
over
the
then
the
woman
of
lonesome
cove
borrowed
that
name
from
some
old
record
asked
sedgwick
follow
me
through
a
page
of
unwritten
local
history
said
chester
kent
straightening
up
the
beginning
of
this
story
goes
back
some
years
when
there
lived
not
far
from
hogg
s
haven
in
a
house
which
has
since
been
destroyed
an
older
sister
of
captain
hogg
who
married
into
the
grosvenor
family
she
was
from
the
evidence
of
the
grosvenor
family
historian
who
by
the
way
has
withheld
all
this
from
his
pages
a
woman
of
the
most
extraordinary
charm
and
magnetism
not
beautiful
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
she
had
a
gift
beyond
beauty
and
she
led
men
in
chains
her
husband
appears
to
have
been
a
weakling
who
counted
for
nothing
in
her
life
after
the
birth
of
her
children
seeking
distraction
she
flung
herself
into
mysticism
and
became
the
priestess
of
a
cult
of
which
included
many
of
the
more
cultivated
people
of
this
region
among
them
was
a
young
german
mystic
and
philosopher
who
had
fled
to
this
country
to
escape
punishment
for
political
offenses
hermann
von
miltz
was
his
that
s
why
she
called
me
hermann
broke
in
preston
in
an
awed
half
whisper
don
t
jump
to
wild
conclusions
said
kent
smilingly
some
of
their
correspondence
is
still
extant
she
signed
herself
astræa
in
handwriting
similar
to
the
signature
of
that
note
of
yours
jax
there
seems
to
have
been
no
guilt
between
them
as
the
law
judges
guilt
the
bond
was
a
mystic
one
but
it
was
none
the
less
fatal
it
culminated
in
a
tragedy
of
which
the
details
are
lost
perhaps
it
was
an
elopement
that
they
planned
perhaps
a
double
suicide
with
the
idea
that
their
souls
would
be
united
in
death
there
are
hints
of
that
in
the
old
letters
in
the
historian
s
possession
and
in
the
library
at
hedgerow
house
this
much
is
known
the
couple
embarked
together
in
a
small
boat
von
miltz
was
never
again
heard
of
camilla
grosvenor
s
body
came
ashore
in
lonesome
cove
she
was
the
cove
s
earliest
recorded
victim
the
sketch
which
that
elder
dennett
left
at
your
door
sedgwick
supposing
it
to
be
a
likeness
of
the
unfortunate
creature
he
had
seen
on
the
road
to
your
house
is
a
charles
elliott
sketch
for
the
portrait
of
camilla
my
god
jax
burst
out
was
it
a
ghost
i
met
up
with
that
night
on
hawkill
heights
as
near
a
ghost
as
you
are
ever
likely
to
encounter
probably
answered
kent
but
see
here
said
adam
bain
i
m
a
lawyer
the
law
doesn
t
deal
with
ghosts
or
are
you
trying
to
tell
us
professor
kent
that
the
soul
of
this
grosvenor
came
back
to
inhabit
the
body
of
the
jane
doe
of
lonesome
cove
not
precisely
that
either
everything
is
strictly
within
the
limits
of
the
law
s
cognizance
bain
as
you
will
see
now
i
m
going
to
make
a
long
jump
down
to
the
present
if
i
fail
to
keep
the
trail
clear
anywhere
you
are
any
of
you
at
liberty
to
interrupt
me
first
then
i
want
you
to
follow
with
me
the
course
of
a
figure
that
leaves
hedgerow
house
on
the
late
afternoon
of
july
fifth
by
chance
the
figure
is
not
seen
except
at
a
distance
by
gansett
jim
who
suspected
nothing
then
otherwise
it
would
have
been
stopped
as
it
wears
blair
s
necklace
and
dressing
the
part
of
astræa
guessed
lawyer
bain
precisely
our
jeweled
figure
in
a
dress
that
is
an
old
one
of
blair
s
and
with
a
package
in
hand
makes
its
way
across
country
to
the
to
join
me
said
preston
jax
to
join
you
chance
brings
the
wayfarer
face
to
face
with
that
gentleman
of
the
peekaboo
mind
elder
dennett
they
talk
the
stranger
by
chance
though
the
elder
assumed
it
was
the
home
of
francis
sedgwick
at
the
entrance
to
sedgwick
s
place
the
pair
met
there
was
a
curious
encounter
ending
in
sedgwick
s
demanding
an
explanation
of
the
which
he
knew
to
be
blair
how
did
he
know
that
demanded
alexander
blair
because
i
had
worn
them
when
i
sat
to
him
said
marjorie
blair
quietly
you
sat
to
sedgwick
for
your
picture
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
of
this
no
explanation
was
due
you
it
was
a
matter
of
chance
our
acquaintance
sedgwick
did
not
even
know
who
i
nor
who
his
other
visitor
was
i
suppose
said
blair
with
a
savage
sneer
no
said
sedgwick
nor
do
i
know
to
this
the
stranger
continued
kent
refused
to
give
sedgwick
any
explanation
and
when
he
threatened
to
follow
stunned
him
with
a
rock
and
escaped
some
distance
down
the
road
the
wayfarer
encountered
simon
groot
the
itinerant
merchant
sedgwick
afterward
met
him
and
made
inquiries
but
obtained
no
why
was
sedgwick
so
eager
to
recover
the
trail
if
he
had
not
murder
in
his
mind
demanded
blair
you
are
proceeding
on
the
theory
that
sedgwick
knowing
who
blair
was
and
who
the
strange
visitor
was
deliberately
killed
the
latter
for
motives
of
his
own
but
sedgwick
can
prove
that
he
was
back
in
his
house
by
nine
o
clock
and
we
have
a
witness
here
who
was
talking
with
the
wearer
of
the
necklace
at
that
hour
jax
let
us
have
your
holding
the
copy
of
the
confession
in
his
hand
in
case
of
confusion
of
memory
the
told
of
his
rendezvous
of
the
swift
savage
attack
of
the
appalling
incident
of
the
manacles
of
the
wild
race
across
the
heights
and
of
the
final
tragedy
i
ve
thought
and
wondered
and
figured
day
and
night
he
said
in
conclusion
and
i
can
t
get
at
what
that
rope
and
the
handcuffs
the
handcuffs
must
have
come
from
that
dreadful
collection
of
captain
hogg
s
things
in
the
big
hallway
at
hedgerow
house
said
marjorie
blair
yes
assented
kent
and
the
dim
clue
to
their
purpose
goes
back
again
i
fancy
to
the
strange
mysticism
of
the
original
astræa
the
disordered
mind
with
which
we
have
to
deal
seems
to
have
been
guarding
against
any
such
separation
as
divided
in
death
astræa
from
her
but
chester
objected
sedgwick
you
speak
of
a
disordered
mind
and
yet
you
ve
told
us
that
it
isn
t
a
case
of
never
contradicted
kent
you
ve
misinterpreted
what
i
said
in
the
early
stages
of
the
affair
i
told
you
if
you
remember
that
a
very
bizarre
situation
indicated
a
very
bizarre
motive
what
could
be
more
bizarre
than
insanity
was
it
suicidal
insanity
then
asked
bain
not
in
the
ordinary
and
intentional
then
it
was
the
other
man
that
killed
her
said
preston
jax
the
man
i
heard
yell
when
she
went
over
but
what
became
of
him
simon
groot
spoke
of
hearing
that
man
s
scream
too
confirmed
bain
have
you
got
any
clue
to
him
professor
kent
the
other
man
was
francis
sedgwick
declared
alexander
blair
doggedly
chester
kent
shook
his
head
i
ve
got
a
witness
against
that
theory
from
your
own
side
blair
said
he
gansett
jim
at
first
thought
as
you
do
in
that
belief
he
tried
to
kill
sedgwick
now
he
knows
his
mistake
isn
t
that
so
jim
yeh
grunted
the
you
were
out
through
the
countryside
that
night
trying
to
trace
the
and
later
when
i
showed
you
the
footprints
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle
you
saw
that
they
were
not
sedgwick
s
you
examined
the
cliff
for
footprints
do
you
think
any
one
pushed
or
pursued
the
victim
over
the
brink
whose
were
the
footprints
that
you
found
jim
demanded
alexander
blair
the
pointed
in
silence
to
preston
jax
of
course
his
the
other
s
but
there
were
the
marks
of
a
third
person
weren
t
there
there
must
have
been
insisted
blair
are
you
positive
then
did
the
other
man
the
man
whom
jax
heard
cry
out
walk
without
leaving
any
trace
there
was
no
other
man
said
chester
kent
don
t
you
understand
blair
he
added
with
significant
emphasis
the
source
of
that
cry
in
the
night
heard
by
jax
and
simon
groot
a
flash
of
enlightenment
swept
blair
s
face
he
said
in
a
breath
then
i
was
wrong
i
beg
sedgwick
s
sedgwick
bowed
marjorie
blair
s
hand
went
out
and
her
fingers
closed
softly
on
the
tense
hand
of
her
no
third
person
had
any
part
whatsoever
in
the
drama
which
jax
has
recounted
to
us
pursued
kent
in
the
morning
the
body
was
discovered
sheriff
schlager
was
sent
for
he
found
in
the
pocket
something
that
betrayed
the
connection
of
the
body
with
hedgerow
a
bit
of
with
the
heading
still
legible
said
the
sheriff
with
this
he
accosted
gansett
jim
who
after
a
search
had
come
out
on
the
cliff
jim
assuming
that
the
sheriff
knew
all
told
him
of
the
identity
of
the
body
the
sheriff
saw
a
chance
for
money
in
i
do
you
an
injustice
schlager
you
ll
correct
go
right
ahead
don
t
mind
me
i
ll
take
my
very
well
schlager
adopted
the
theory
which
jax
had
prepared
for
him
so
to
speak
that
the
body
was
washed
ashore
and
arranged
with
the
connivance
of
doctor
breed
the
medical
officer
to
bury
it
as
an
unknown
for
this
perversion
of
their
duty
blair
rewarded
them
handsomely
as
i
understand
it
he
dreaded
any
publicity
attaching
itself
to
hedgerow
house
and
his
god
knows
i
had
suffered
enough
of
that
murmured
blair
let
us
hope
it
is
now
ended
to
avoid
this
blair
was
willing
even
to
let
the
supposed
murderer
whom
he
believed
to
be
sedgwick
go
unscathed
of
justice
by
chance
however
i
saw
the
body
on
the
beach
the
most
important
discovery
of
all
i
missed
at
that
time
very
more
so
in
that
i
had
a
clue
in
the
character
of
the
assault
upon
i
could
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
corpse
had
not
been
washed
ashore
moreover
the
matter
of
the
manacles
stimulated
my
interest
not
until
the
inquest
however
did
i
realize
the
really
startling
and
unique
feature
of
the
case
there
is
where
you
and
doctor
breed
made
your
fatal
error
that
s
right
you
saw
the
face
when
we
lifted
the
lid
i
s
no
you
were
too
quick
in
replacing
then
how
did
you
get
on
to
the
thing
from
seeing
the
face
after
the
body
was
returned
to
the
court
hold
on
a
bit
interrupted
lawyer
bain
i
remember
there
was
a
fuss
about
the
corpse
not
being
publicly
shown
for
identification
some
of
us
insisted
the
sheriff
gave
in
the
coffin
lid
wasn
t
quarter
off
when
breed
gave
a
yell
and
clapped
it
on
again
and
they
took
the
body
back
to
his
house
and
shut
themselves
in
with
it
for
half
an
hour
before
they
took
it
to
the
hall
again
naturally
being
suspicious
i
looked
at
it
pretty
close
but
i
didn
t
see
anything
possibly
you
didn
t
notice
a
cut
on
the
cheek
suggested
kent
yes
dennett
spoke
of
it
and
the
sheriff
shut
him
up
but
what
of
it
it
might
have
been
done
in
any
one
of
a
dozen
but
it
wasn
t
there
when
the
body
lay
on
the
in
the
rolling
and
tossing
of
the
journey
there
might
easily
be
minor
scarifications
said
sedgwick
true
but
frank
what
did
you
suppose
that
sudden
shift
on
the
part
of
the
officers
of
the
law
meant
perhaps
that
the
body
was
not
in
fit
condition
to
be
in
that
case
what
could
they
have
done
to
make
it
more
fit
nothing
i
suppose
i
didn
t
consider
i
rather
opined
said
lawyer
bain
that
some
one
had
changed
bodies
on
that
s
what
made
you
so
cussed
curious
was
it
adam
barked
the
sheriff
there
was
no
exchange
of
bodies
said
kent
but
there
was
a
change
in
the
body
what
kind
of
a
change
asked
sedgwick
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
to
think
that
after
death
the
hair
grows
fast
i
ve
heard
it
said
said
lawyer
bain
that
it
grows
faster
than
in
and
that
it
grows
not
only
on
the
head
but
on
the
face
as
well
the
face
a
woman
s
face
exclaimed
sedgwick
no
a
man
what
man
the
man
in
the
have
you
lost
your
mind
chet
the
body
in
the
coffin
was
that
of
the
woman
who
met
me
at
the
entrance
to
the
no
it
was
the
body
of
the
man
who
dressed
in
woman
s
clothing
met
you
at
the
nook
and
knocked
you
down
with
a
stone
flung
overhand
as
not
one
woman
in
a
thousand
could
have
thrown
it
that
in
itself
ought
to
have
suggested
the
secret
to
me
long
before
i
discovered
but
how
did
you
discover
it
inquired
sedgwick
in
bewilderment
since
you
didn
t
see
the
growth
of
beard
on
the
dead
face
yourself
by
the
cut
on
the
cheek
you
see
the
sheriff
had
failed
to
foresee
that
telltale
beard
so
when
in
deference
to
bain
s
protest
against
burial
without
a
formal
view
of
the
body
they
opened
up
the
casket
and
saw
the
obvious
change
in
the
face
there
was
nothing
for
the
officials
to
do
but
remedy
their
carelessness
they
had
the
body
taken
to
the
house
and
did
the
best
they
could
that
cut
on
the
cheek
was
a
razor
cut
having
realized
that
much
i
had
to
deal
thenceforth
with
the
mystery
of
a
dead
man
masquerading
as
a
woman
and
being
abetted
in
the
deception
by
the
officers
of
the
astræa
a
man
broke
in
preston
jax
his
chin
in
a
spasm
no
wonder
put
up
such
a
fight
who
was
he
my
son
wilfrid
blair
said
alexander
blair
sedgwick
took
a
swift
involuntary
step
toward
marjorie
but
kent
was
before
him
setting
a
firm
hand
on
his
shoulder
not
now
frank
he
said
then
turning
to
the
you
see
blair
he
said
very
gently
it
isn
t
so
bad
as
you
feared
there
was
no
other
woman
in
the
case
no
disgrace
no
shame
you
need
feel
nothing
but
pity
for
an
unhappy
wrecked
mind
for
which
death
was
the
happiest
marjorie
blair
sat
very
still
and
white
let
me
think
she
whispered
let
me
think
but
the
man
s
voice
exclaimed
jax
the
voice
of
the
man
on
the
cliff
wilfrid
blair
s
said
kent
in
the
final
moment
he
came
to
himself
at
last
he
resumed
his
voice
up
to
then
he
had
been
in
voice
manner
thought
purpose
unconsciously
playing
a
astræa
said
sedgwick
and
jax
in
a
breath
yes
it
was
one
of
those
strange
and
complete
assumptions
of
personality
which
puzzle
the
alienists
wilfrid
blair
s
diseased
mind
had
fastened
upon
the
strange
history
of
his
ancestress
and
brooded
on
it
until
he
became
convinced
that
her
spirit
was
reincarnated
in
himself
undoubtedly
his
striking
likeness
to
the
portrait
of
camilla
grosvenor
powerfully
aided
the
obsession
there
were
her
letters
in
the
library
to
give
color
to
his
unconscious
imitation
as
is
common
in
this
form
of
dementia
he
was
secretive
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
from
the
time
when
he
recognized
in
preston
jax
s
advertisement
the
call
of
astræa
s
kindred
soul
hermann
von
miltz
his
one
overwhelming
desire
was
to
reenact
the
drama
of
the
last
century
in
his
own
assumed
personality
jax
has
told
us
how
cleverly
and
secretly
the
plan
for
the
double
suicide
was
matured
this
obsession
must
have
been
of
long
we
thought
it
melancholia
said
alexander
blair
as
you
say
he
had
been
very
secretive
very
silent
too
we
kept
gansett
jim
with
him
as
a
sort
of
marjorie
blair
got
to
her
feet
she
was
but
her
voice
and
eyes
were
steady
as
she
faced
kent
i
must
understand
this
all
she
said
wilfrid
s
body
is
where
in
annalaka
then
is
buried
in
his
grave
at
hedgerow
house
nothing
said
alexander
blair
a
mock
funeral
my
dear
said
the
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
old
under
the
unspoken
i
could
not
tell
you
what
i
thought
the
truth
i
thought
then
that
wilfrid
had
encountered
sedgwick
and
there
had
been
a
fight
in
which
he
was
killed
rather
than
face
the
scandal
of
a
murder
trial
a
scandal
in
which
the
family
name
would
have
been
dragged
through
the
mire
of
the
public
prints
again
i
chose
the
part
of
deceit
i
d
have
bribed
a
hundred
officers
of
the
law
rather
than
have
had
you
dragged
to
the
and
have
been
compelled
to
give
testimony
myself
there
has
been
enough
of
public
shame
in
my
but
you
made
me
believe
that
sedgwick
killed
wilfrid
she
accused
i
believed
it
myself
he
retorted
but
what
basis
had
for
suspecting
me
of
the
crime
cried
sedgwick
turning
to
marjorie
blair
you
didn
t
know
of
his
visit
to
me
in
women
s
clothes
you
knew
nothing
of
the
quarrel
it
seems
until
just
now
for
what
possible
reason
in
your
belief
should
i
have
killed
him
she
flushed
to
her
temples
she
murmured
that
he
might
have
known
of
our
acquaintance
and
have
misconstrued
that
he
might
have
gone
to
find
you
and
attacked
you
and
that
you
killed
him
in
i
thank
you
for
that
last
at
least
said
sedgwick
rather
bitterly
then
as
he
saw
her
wince
forgive
me
he
added
in
a
low
tone
but
to
be
suspected
by
you
even
though
you
were
he
stopped
catching
kent
s
frowning
glance
who
discovered
that
the
burial
was
a
false
one
she
asked
after
a
pause
professor
kent
said
blair
he
and
sedgwick
exhumed
the
that
was
the
her
eyes
questioned
sedgwick
that
i
found
you
at
hedgerow
house
yes
he
said
gently
and
that
my
charged
you
with
being
my
husband
s
my
dear
blair
said
kent
uncomfortably
remember
what
justification
he
thought
he
she
considered
a
moment
you
are
right
she
said
with
an
effort
i
don
t
mean
to
be
her
head
dropped
in
thought
whatever
wilfrid
may
have
been
she
continued
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
was
my
husband
i
bear
his
name
and
to
leave
him
in
a
nameless
grave
is
to
dishonor
not
him
alone
but
you
would
claim
the
body
cried
alexander
blair
what
else
is
there
for
us
to
do
she
countered
and
bring
down
upon
us
unavoidably
the
publicity
which
we
have
escaped
at
so
bitter
a
price
cried
the
elder
blair
have
we
not
suffered
enough
from
the
scandal
of
his
life
that
we
should
be
further
involved
in
the
scandal
of
his
death
he
s
right
miss
it
won
t
do
said
the
sheriff
kindly
silence
is
best
said
sedgwick
what
the
papers
would
do
with
this
opined
preston
jax
would
be
a
my
advice
is
to
let
be
proffered
lawyer
bain
yeh
grunted
the
oh
are
you
all
against
me
she
cried
mr
kent
you
too
do
you
think
me
wrong
no
said
kent
will
you
drag
our
name
hers
as
well
as
mine
in
the
mud
cried
the
head
of
the
house
of
blair
no
said
kent
again
but
how
me
what
you
no
said
kent
and
with
such
absolute
flat
finality
that
the
others
looked
at
him
in
blank
silence
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
tremendous
sigh
all
eyes
turned
to
preston
jax
who
had
risen
and
was
leaning
against
the
wall
his
chin
jerking
galvanically
well
said
kent
what
about
me
asked
the
miserably
kent
s
fingers
twitched
at
his
ear
lobe
well
what
about
you
he
repeated
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
you
oh
you
go
back
to
irene
said
kent
with
his
half
smile
that
s
your
sentence
if
blair
the
astrologer
drew
a
quick
breath
the
light
of
a
great
relief
softened
his
hard
little
eyes
a
startled
look
widened
them
as
marjorie
blair
her
own
trouble
forgotten
for
the
moment
rose
and
went
over
to
him
the
reflection
of
another
s
happiness
shining
in
her
face
and
making
it
doubly
lovely
a
ring
glinted
in
her
outstretched
hand
take
this
she
said
softly
for
your
irene
may
you
be
very
very
happy
together
for
the
space
of
five
seconds
preston
jax
s
chin
was
motionless
then
a
minor
cataclysm
convulsed
it
speech
emerged
from
that
facial
quake
in
a
wholly
absurd
and
and
ll
i
say
whut
ll
i
do
to
thank
you
ma
am
ll
just
tell
you
this
it
s
me
for
the
from
now
on
and
if
ever
you
or
professor
kent
or
any
of
you
want
an
special
charted
for
self
or
friends
he
made
a
rush
for
the
hallway
and
the
door
banged
a
period
to
his
emotion
i
think
said
chester
kent
gravely
that
lesson
will
as
marjorie
blair
stood
smiling
at
the
door
whence
the
overcome
had
disappeared
sedgwick
started
to
pass
with
quick
and
unexpected
tact
alexander
blair
drew
the
sheriff
and
the
lawyer
aside
giving
to
the
young
people
their
moment
she
looked
up
at
sedgwick
with
lifted
eyebrows
are
you
not
going
to
speak
to
me
she
said
sorrowfully
what
is
there
to
say
except
one
that
i
may
not
say
no
no
she
whispered
in
affright
but
say
you
forgive
you
for
what
for
having
believed
even
for
an
instant
what
father
blair
said
that
you
were
the
sedgwick
smiled
bravely
that
is
all
and
you
ll
think
of
me
at
least
kindly
i
ll
think
of
you
with
every
beat
of
my
heart
he
said
passionately
across
her
face
passed
the
look
of
fairy
wistfulness
that
was
all
her
own
no
she
said
it
would
be
both
of
you
should
forget
for
the
he
leaned
over
her
what
shall
assuage
the
unforgotten
pain
and
teach
the
unforgetful
to
forget
he
quoted
very
low
and
yet
she
persisted
it
would
be
easier
now
that
i
am
going
going
away
for
long
she
nodded
with
compressed
lips
sedgwick
turned
very
white
oh
don
t
look
like
that
she
faltered
i
can
t
bear
it
can
t
you
see
that
after
what
has
happened
i
must
go
i
must
have
time
to
forget
there
is
so
much
to
forget
surely
you
can
be
again
he
smiled
at
her
with
a
courage
shining
through
his
pain
that
brought
the
quick
tears
to
her
eyes
yes
i
can
wait
and
again
he
leaned
to
her
and
think
how
she
far
from
me
with
like
eyes
sees
through
the
untuneful
bough
the
wingless
he
drew
her
gaze
to
his
own
held
it
for
the
space
of
a
and
was
gone
chapter
summer
had
waned
from
the
coast
and
with
it
had
passed
the
keenness
of
local
interest
in
the
strangest
victim
of
lonesome
cove
even
the
indefatigable
tongue
of
elder
dennett
had
almost
ceased
to
clack
on
the
topic
by
the
fall
of
the
first
snow
other
subjects
of
absorbing
interest
supervened
during
the
long
winter
the
wreck
of
the
schooner
yacht
off
dead
men
s
eddy
the
coming
of
the
new
presbyterian
minister
at
martindale
center
whose
wife
was
reported
to
be
a
suffragette
the
mysterious
benefaction
that
had
befallen
old
orcutt
late
in
february
enabling
her
to
leave
her
home
next
to
annalaka
churchyard
and
take
her
asthma
southward
in
search
of
a
cure
the
rumor
that
hedgerow
house
was
to
be
sold
before
summer
and
young
blair
s
body
along
with
it
i
expect
remarked
the
elder
malevolently
seems
to
me
if
i
was
a
millionaire
like
alexander
blair
i
wouldn
t
sell
my
own
flesh
and
blood
dead
or
of
alexander
blair
himself
nothing
had
been
seen
in
the
neighborhood
since
nor
of
his
hedgerow
house
was
in
charge
of
gansett
jim
as
caretaker
professor
kent
had
left
about
the
same
time
as
the
blairs
but
francis
sedgwick
had
stuck
to
the
nook
studying
first
the
cold
grays
and
browns
of
november
and
later
the
wonderful
blazing
whites
and
subtle
blues
of
drift
and
shadow
spread
before
him
in
winter
s
endless
panorama
with
the
same
enthusiasm
that
he
had
devoted
to
october
s
riot
of
color
though
the
work
prospered
the
worker
had
paled
it
was
the
opinion
of
martindale
center
and
annalaka
alike
that
the
painter
feller
was
looking
right
peaky
and
piny
like
one
whose
conscience
ached
but
sedgwick
had
nothing
worse
than
a
heartache
and
the
fates
were
making
medicine
for
that
on
the
blast
of
a
gale
chester
kent
dropped
down
at
the
door
of
the
nook
one
wild
afternoon
without
warning
as
always
he
was
impeccably
clad
though
his
stout
boots
showed
the
usage
of
recent
hard
wear
leaving
austin
that
morning
with
his
light
valise
slung
to
his
shoulder
he
had
footed
the
fifteen
miles
of
soggy
earth
to
sedgwick
s
place
in
a
luxurious
tussle
against
the
wind
throwing
open
the
door
he
called
his
friend
s
name
instantly
the
artist
came
loping
down
the
stairs
and
had
him
by
the
shoulders
i
ve
got
a
caller
up
above
he
said
after
the
usual
greetings
and
questionings
were
over
yes
have
you
gone
in
for
local
society
not
exactly
local
it
s
alexander
said
kent
in
surprise
what
brings
him
why
he
came
down
to
hedgerow
house
to
look
after
certain
books
and
papers
and
ran
over
here
to
make
his
in
form
chet
i
hate
being
apologized
of
course
every
one
does
nevertheless
it
s
good
exercise
for
blair
esquire
brings
into
action
some
muscles
of
his
soul
that
might
otherwise
have
atrophied
from
he
s
the
blair
of
old
just
the
same
he
made
his
apology
as
handsomely
as
need
be
i
ll
bring
him
down
the
fabric
magnate
descended
from
the
studio
and
greeted
kent
briefly
then
turned
to
his
host
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
ask
kent
to
step
outside
i
have
some
business
with
stay
here
said
the
artist
i
ll
go
back
to
my
which
he
did
when
a
man
once
declines
employment
with
me
said
alexander
blair
to
kent
i
never
give
him
a
second
chance
that
rule
i
am
going
to
break
i
need
your
honored
indeed
murmured
kent
will
you
accept
the
commission
not
if
it
is
like
your
former
it
is
not
it
is
bona
fide
some
one
has
been
tampering
with
my
son
s
you
mean
the
grave
at
hedgerow
house
yes
gansett
jim
reports
that
there
are
signs
of
recent
digging
it
looks
as
if
ghouls
had
been
at
work
there
with
the
idea
of
getting
the
body
and
holding
it
for
ransom
they
would
have
had
a
fine
surprise
if
they
had
got
the
coffin
out
because
they
d
have
found
no
body
in
it
you
mean
certainly
but
suppose
they
discovered
that
there
were
no
remains
nothing
but
a
punctured
do
you
see
the
potentialities
of
blackmail
then
you
are
stupider
than
i
ever
took
you
for
growled
the
magnate
like
most
things
it
depends
on
the
point
of
view
i
don
t
think
that
you
are
in
any
danger
of
blackmail
but
if
i
understand
the
matter
you
want
your
mind
relieved
of
anxiety
on
the
point
very
well
i
ll
take
the
that
is
settled
then
said
the
older
man
briskly
now
this
being
a
strictly
business
deal
we
will
discuss
oh
there
is
no
room
for
discussion
as
to
my
terms
said
kent
easily
i
make
them
and
you
accept
them
that
s
alexander
blair
s
eyebrows
drew
down
in
a
heavy
scowl
do
you
know
of
an
old
lady
named
orcutt
in
annalaka
pursued
the
scientist
she
owns
the
house
just
next
to
annalaka
churchyard
where
your
son
was
buried
as
jane
doe
she
is
a
very
worthy
old
lady
but
she
suffers
severely
from
asthma
in
fact
it
keeps
her
awake
most
of
the
night
so
some
interested
persons
have
subscribed
money
and
sent
her
south
to
a
sanatorium
i
d
like
to
get
you
interested
in
her
you
wish
me
to
subscribe
oh
more
than
that
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
you
were
to
assume
the
entire
expense
of
the
you
mean
reimburse
the
subscribers
for
a
few
seconds
the
millionaire
studied
kent
s
candid
face
very
well
he
agreed
how
much
sheriff
schlager
can
tell
you
he
is
keeping
the
accounts
you
see
it
was
necessary
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
her
windows
overlook
the
so
you
took
occasion
to
indicate
repetition
of
a
really
relevant
point
is
excusable
she
left
two
weeks
ago
very
much
mystified
but
pathetically
thankful
poor
old
girl
she
has
no
monopoly
on
being
mystified
observed
blair
with
pursed
lips
probably
she
never
will
understand
that
s
where
you
have
the
advantage
of
her
for
i
think
you
ll
see
quite
clearly
the
reason
for
her
trip
and
the
propriety
of
your
footing
the
go
when
she
was
safely
out
of
the
way
and
no
longer
overlooking
annalaka
churchyard
by
night
from
her
window
schlager
adam
bain
and
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
place
technically
what
we
did
there
amounts
to
grave
robbery
i
suppose
but
we
covered
our
tracks
well
and
i
don
t
think
anybody
will
ever
discover
what
has
been
well
queried
his
hearer
with
twitching
jaw
what
lay
nameless
in
annalaka
churchyard
said
kent
gravely
now
rests
in
its
own
place
at
hedgerow
house
the
marks
found
by
gansett
jim
were
made
by
us
so
your
alarm
is
groundless
but
i
wish
that
you
might
have
heard
the
little
prayer
made
by
that
simple
country
lawyer
over
your
son
s
grave
once
in
a
while
i
meet
with
a
really
good
man
like
adam
bain
and
then
i
have
to
reconstruct
my
whole
formula
of
the
average
cussedness
of
human
alexander
blair
s
clenched
hands
went
to
his
temples
in
a
singular
gesture
and
dropped
again
what
interest
did
schlager
and
bain
have
in
the
matter
he
added
in
a
low
tone
why
schlager
had
done
some
dirty
work
for
you
and
wanted
to
even
accounts
with
his
own
conscience
as
for
bain
we
needed
a
third
man
we
could
trust
i
asked
him
and
got
him
it
was
no
small
risk
for
him
if
you
felt
that
his
risk
is
worth
some
reward
you
yes
yes
interrupted
the
other
eagerly
do
you
think
a
perhaps
kent
smiled
by
thinking
hard
i
could
think
a
thousand
he
said
but
not
more
in
this
case
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
bain
might
not
survive
the
shock
thank
you
very
much
and
now
said
the
older
man
i
am
still
in
the
dark
as
to
your
interest
in
the
mine
why
for
one
thing
i
dislike
to
leave
any
affair
unfinished
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
now
that
this
is
forever
settled
and
done
with
besides
there
was
a
a
near
a
promise
as
i
often
permit
myself
to
go
in
a
world
of
accidents
errors
and
to
blair
is
she
back
from
europe
she
is
at
hedgerow
blair
communed
with
himself
for
a
time
then
said
abruptly
by
the
way
do
you
think
your
friend
sedgwick
would
come
over
to
a
dinner
before
we
leave
kent
s
face
lighted
up
ask
him
said
he
heartily
and
see
i
will
as
soon
as
i
get
home
good
blair
hesitated
he
seemed
to
have
difficulty
in
going
and
embarrassment
in
staying
he
coughed
and
cleared
his
throat
looked
over
kent
s
head
and
down
at
his
feet
and
finally
got
himself
into
words
kent
he
blurted
i
realize
now
why
you
won
t
take
my
money
i
can
always
buy
brains
but
i
can
t
buy
the
bigger
better
thing
it
isn
t
in
the
market
thank
you
he
caught
the
scientist
s
hand
in
a
swift
hard
grip
and
strode
off
down
the
road
chester
kent
went
back
into
the
house
with
a
glow
at
his
heart
he
shouted
to
sedgwick
go
on
with
your
work
frank
i
want
to
loaf
and
invite
my
soul
for
an
hour
where
s
your
reading
matter
shelf
in
the
corner
answered
the
artist
you
ll
find
a
few
things
in
your
line
s
of
le
conte
the
devil
take
darwin
cried
kent
impiously
i
want
or
the
or
something
like
that
really
fit
for
an
aspiring
intellect
never
mind
i
ll
forage
for
three
minutes
later
he
was
stretched
luxuriously
on
the
divan
with
the
pulled
down
and
the
big
electric
chandelier
glowing
immersed
in
the
joyous
nonsense
of
and
the
wind
alternately
shouted
profane
protests
at
the
window
because
it
couldn
t
get
in
and
then
fell
silent
waiting
for
an
answer
in
one
of
these
lulls
kent
heard
footsteps
outside
he
dropped
his
book
the
footsteps
approached
the
window
then
the
gale
rose
again
and
the
loose
end
of
a
garment
flapped
softly
against
the
glass
he
half
rose
listening
there
was
silence
outside
have
i
fallen
into
another
mystery
groaned
kent
is
there
no
rest
for
the
weary
the
footsteps
mounted
the
side
porch
kent
awaited
a
knock
none
came
odd
he
observed
to
his
pillow
few
people
find
the
outside
of
a
door
so
fascinating
that
they
stand
for
two
minutes
in
a
wet
gale
admiring
tiptoeing
to
the
door
he
threw
it
open
there
was
a
startled
cry
from
without
and
an
equally
startled
grunt
from
within
chester
kent
and
marjorie
blair
stood
face
to
face
beg
your
pardon
gibbered
kent
whelmed
instantly
in
a
morass
of
embarrassment
didn
t
mean
to
frighten
she
built
up
her
on
the
ruins
of
his
i
wonder
she
said
with
a
smile
whether
i
m
the
one
of
you
see
he
said
lamely
it
was
so
sudden
coming
that
way
i
didn
t
expect
and
for
that
reason
you
intend
to
bar
me
from
the
house
it
s
quite
disgustingly
wet
out
with
a
muttered
apology
kent
stepped
aside
and
she
entered
even
amid
his
he
could
not
but
note
how
the
girlish
loveliness
had
ripened
and
warmed
yet
without
forfeiting
anything
of
that
quaint
appealing
wistfulness
which
made
her
charm
unique
but
there
glinted
now
in
her
deep
eyes
an
elfish
spirit
of
mischief
partly
inspired
by
the
confusion
of
the
helpless
male
creature
before
her
partly
the
reaction
from
the
mingled
dread
and
desire
of
the
prospective
meeting
with
sedgwick
for
she
had
come
on
a
sudden
uncontrollable
impulse
to
see
him
and
would
have
turned
and
fled
at
the
last
minute
had
not
kent
surprised
her
perhaps
there
was
a
little
flavor
of
revenge
for
this
too
in
her
attitude
toward
him
what
a
surprise
to
find
you
here
kent
she
remarked
sweetly
or
are
you
calling
youself
blair
nowadays
and
how
is
your
poor
ear
chester
kent
immediately
seized
that
unoffending
member
and
clung
to
it
with
much
the
lost
and
anguished
expression
of
the
pale
martyr
in
the
once
popular
of
chromo
his
tormentor
considered
him
with
malicious
eyes
did
any
woman
ever
say
boo
to
him
suddenly
i
wonder
she
mused
aloud
like
a
saving
grace
there
came
into
kent
s
mind
a
fragment
of
hunting
of
the
in
which
he
had
just
been
reveling
said
he
gravely
he
would
answer
to
hi
or
to
any
loud
cry
such
as
fry
me
or
fritter
my
wig
she
caught
up
the
stanza
to
or
but
especially
so
you
know
lewis
carroll
how
really
human
of
you
it
is
better
to
be
humane
than
human
murmured
kent
relinquishing
his
aural
grip
as
he
began
to
touch
bottom
is
that
a
plea
very
well
i
shall
be
very
gentle
and
soothing
but
oh
she
burst
out
irrepressibly
may
the
kindly
fates
give
me
to
be
among
those
present
when
you
fall
in
love
kent
favored
her
with
an
elaborate
bow
your
presence
would
be
the
one
really
she
approved
you
re
progressing
i
begin
to
feel
repaid
for
my
visit
this
time
kent
looked
her
in
the
eye
you
re
not
very
demanding
in
the
matter
of
returns
for
your
trouble
he
remarked
to
come
through
all
this
wind
and
rain
and
then
be
content
merely
to
contemplate
the
outside
of
a
argues
an
humble
spirit
to
be
sure
however
it
s
a
very
good
door
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
our
local
architecture
and
may
lead
sorts
of
it
was
her
turn
to
grow
red
you
haven
t
asked
me
about
sedgwick
he
continued
is
he
well
she
inquired
formally
but
with
quickened
breath
he
is
more
than
that
he
is
a
man
a
man
he
added
meaningly
for
any
woman
to
be
proud
there
was
a
step
on
the
floor
above
marjorie
blair
s
hand
went
to
her
heart
i
didn
t
know
he
was
here
she
panted
affrightedly
i
came
just
at
the
place
then
i
saw
the
light
and
i
wanted
so
to
come
in
but
i
didn
t
dare
i
can
t
see
him
now
i
must
go
don
t
chester
kent
raised
his
voice
frank
he
called
come
down
here
quick
not
twice
in
his
life
had
sedgwick
heard
that
tone
in
his
friend
s
voice
the
bungalow
shook
to
his
long
tread
across
the
floor
the
studio
door
opened
and
flew
shut
behind
him
he
took
the
stairs
at
a
leap
and
on
the
landing
stopped
dead
marjorie
he
whispered
she
shrank
back
a
little
from
the
light
in
his
eyes
what
do
you
do
here
he
said
very
low
still
she
did
not
speak
but
stood
tremulous
her
face
half
panic
half
passion
unobtrusively
kent
slid
along
the
wall
like
a
shadow
and
vanished
into
the
night
where
have
you
been
sedgwick
asked
the
woman
of
his
love
everywhere
nowhere
what
does
it
matter
she
faltered
i
ve
come
he
went
forward
and
took
her
hands
in
his
cold
little
hands
that
clung
as
they
touched
why
did
you
never
write
me
he
asked
gently
i
don
t
know
i
couldn
t
don
t
ask
me
to
explain
it
was
just
that
felt
i
must
come
back
to
you
as
i
had
come
to
you
first
unexpected
and
without
a
word
can
you
understand
no
he
said
no
i
suppose
not
a
man
couldn
good
god
he
burst
out
do
you
realize
what
it
is
to
live
in
such
a
hell
of
uncertainty
and
longing
as
i
ve
lived
in
since
you
left
to
wait
and
hope
and
lose
hope
and
hope
and
wait
again
for
a
word
that
never
comes
to
eat
your
heart
out
with
waiting
a
slow
wonderful
smile
trembled
on
her
lips
my
dear
she
said
i
have
waited
for
you
all
my
suddenly
her
arms
were
around
him
her
cheek
was
pressed
to
his
own
the
breath
of
her
whisper
was
at
his
ear
oh
forgive
me
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
my
dear
my
dearest
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
chester
kent
drew
in
the
deep
breath
of
satisfied
and
rounded
achievement
he
had
beheld
against
the
wide
two
shadows
which
standing
motionless
for
a
moment
a
few
feet
apart
had
drawn
slowly
together
as
by
some
irresistible
magnetism
and
suddenly
merged
into
one
the
unintentional
eavesdropper
nodded
in
grave
gratulation
to
the
house
then
turned
away
finished
he
said
est
conclu
finis
telos
das
and
any
or
all
other
words
of
whatever
language
meaning
a
sound
conclusion
half
an
hour
later
he
entered
with
due
preliminary
stamping
of
mud
from
clogged
feet
instantly
marjorie
went
over
to
him
why
you
re
wet
as
a
rag
she
cried
with
a
sweetly
unconscious
assumption
of
proprietary
interest
you
must
go
and
change
at
once
she
added
patting
his
shoulder
kent
reached
for
his
ear
changed
his
mind
midway
and
scratched
his
nose
all
right
he
said
meekly
over
his
rather
face
there
came
a
singularly
winning
smile
you
he
said
that
s
as
it
should
be
that
s
worth
no
other
congratulations
will
ever
sound
so
good
as
that
chet
said
sedgwick
in
a
low
voice
or
so
unselfish
you
ve
had
all
the
heat
and
toil
of
the
great
game
and
i
have
all
the
not
quite
all
i
fancy
returned
kent
smiling
at
marjorie
she
took
his
wet
hand
between
her
own
but
it
doesn
t
seem
quite
fair
she
protested
frank
and
i
have
found
each
other
but
you
who
have
fought
our
battle
for
us
so
splendidly
what
reward
do
you
have
chester
kent
shook
his
head
my
dear

said
gently

great

isn

played
