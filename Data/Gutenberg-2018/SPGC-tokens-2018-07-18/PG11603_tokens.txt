in
england
during
the
sixties
and
seventies
of
last
century
the
world
of
books
was
dominated
by
one
gargantuan
type
of
fiction
the
terms
book
and
novel
became
almost
synonymous
in
houses
which
were
not
puritan
yet
where
books
and
reading
in
the
era
of
few
and
unfree
libraries
were
strictly
circumscribed
george
gissing
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
the
english
novel
was
at
the
summit
of
its
reputation
during
his
boyish
days
as
a
lad
of
eight
or
nine
he
remembered
the
parts
of
mutual
coming
to
the
house
and
could
recall
the
smile
of
welcome
with
which
they
were
infallibly
received
in
the
at
home
was
a
handsomely
framed
picture
which
he
regarded
with
an
almost
idolatrous
veneration
it
was
an
engraved
portrait
of
charles
dickens
some
of
the
best
work
of
george
eliot
reade
and

was
yet
to
make
its
appearance
meredith
and
hardy
were
still
the
treasured
possession
of
the
few
the
reigning
models
during
the
period
of
gissing
adolescence
were
probably
dickens
and
trollope
and
the
numerous
satellites
of
these
great
stars
prominent
among
them
wilkie
collins
william
black
and
besant
and
rice
of
the
cluster
of
novelists
who
emerged
from
this
school
of
ideas
the
two
who
will
attract
most
attention
in
the
future
were
clouded
and
obscured
for
the
greater
period
of
their
working
lives
unobserved
they
received
and
made
their
own
preparations
for
utilising
the
legacy
of
the
novel
moral

copious

and
the

of

cumbrous
and

of

they
received
the
legacy
in
a
totally
different
spirit

george
gissing
for
the
most
part
accepted
them
he
put
his
slender
frame
into
the
ponderous
collar
of
the
author
of
the
on
the
and
nearly
collapsed
in
wind
and
limb
in
the
attempt
to
adjust
himself
to
such
an
heroic
type
of
harness
the
distinctive
qualities
of
gissing
at
the
time
of
his
setting
forth
were
a
scholarly
style
rather
fastidious
and
academic
in
its
restraint
and
the
personal
discontent
slightly
morbid
of
a
student
who
finds
himself
in
the
position
of
a
sensitive
woman
in
a
crowd
his
attitude
through
life
was
that
of
a
man
who
having
set
out
on
his
career
with
the
understanding
that
a
ticket
is
to
be
provided
allows
himself
to
be
unceremoniously
hustled
into
the
rough
and
tumble
of
a
noisy
third
circumstances
made
him
revolt
against
an
anonymous
start
in
life
for
a
refined
and
educated
man
under
such
conditions
they
also
made
him
prolific
he
shrank
from
the
restraints
and
humiliations
to
which
the
poor
and
shabbily
dressed
private
tutor
is
exposed
revealed
to
us
with
a
persuasive
terseness
in
the
pages
of
unclassed
new
grub
street
and
the
story
of
writing
fiction
in
a
garret
for
a
sum
sufficient
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
for
the
six
months
following
payment
was
at
any
rate
better
than
this
the
result
was
a
long
series
of
highly
finished
novels
written
in
a
style
and
from
a
point
of
view
which
will
always
render
them
dear
to
the
studious
and
the
upon
the
larger
external
rings
of
the
multitude
it
is
not
probable
that
gissing
will
ever
succeed
in
impressing
himself
there
is
an
absence
of
transcendental
quality
about
his
work
a
failure
in
humour
a
remoteness
from
actual
life
a
deficiency
in
awe
and
mystery
a
shortcoming
in
emotional
power
finally
a
lack
of
the
dramatic
faculty
not
indeed
indispensable
to
a
novelist
but
almost
indispensable
as
an
ingredient
in
great
novels
of
this
particular
genre
in
temperament
and
vitality
he
is
palpably
inferior
to
the
masters
dickens
thackeray
hugo
balzac
whom
he
reverenced
with
such
a
cordial
admiration
and
envy
a
vitality
may
account
for
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
exhaustion
of
his
style
it
were
useless
to
pretend
that
gissing
belongs
of
right
to
the
series
of
english
men
of
letters
but
if
debarred
by
his
limitations
from
a
resounding
or
popular
success
he
will
remain
exceptionally
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
recluse
who
thinks
that
the
scholar
does
well
to
cherish
a
grievance
against
the
vulgar
world
beyond
the
cloister
and
dearer
still
perhaps
to
a
certain
number
of
enthusiasts
who
began
reading
george
gissing
as
a
college
who
closed
and
as
dawn
was
breaking
through
the
elms
in
some
oxford
quadrangle
and
who
have
pursued
his
work
patiently
ever
since
in
a
somewhat
toilsome
and
broken
ascent
secure
always
of
suave
writing
and
conscientious
workmanship

an
individual
prose
cadence
and
a
genuine
vein

kind
of

would

be
postulated

falling

have

upon

atlas

by
the
larger
or
at
any
rate
the
intermediate
public
it
is
a
fact
that
gissing
has
never
been
quite
fairly
estimated
he
loses
immensely
if
you
estimate
him
either
by
a
single
book
as
is
commonly
done
or
by
his
work
as
a
whole
in
the
perspective
of
which
owing
to
the
lack
of
critical
instruction
one
or
two
books
of
rather
inferior
quality
have
obtruded
themselves
unduly
this
brief
survey
of
the
gissing
country
is
designed
to
enable
the
reader
to
judge
the
novelist
by
eight
or
nine
of
his
best
books
if
we
can
select
these
aright
we
feel
sure
that
he
will
end
by
placing
the
work
of
george
gissing
upon
a
considerably
higher
level
than
he
has
hitherto
done
the
time
has
not
yet
come
to
write
the
history
of
his
career
fuliginous
in
not
a
few
of
its
earlier
phases
gathering
serenity
towards
its
close
finding
a
soul
of
goodness

things
evil
this
only
pretends
to
be
a
chronological
and
quite
incidentally
a
critical
survey
of
george
gissing
chief
works
and
comparatively
short
as
his
working
life
proved
to
be
hampered
for
ten
years
by
the
sternest
poverty
and
for
nearly
ten
more
by
the
sad
illusive
optimism
of
the
poitrinaire
the
task
of
the
mere
surveyor
is
no
light
or
perfunctory
one
artistic
as
his
temperament
undoubtedly
was
and
conscientious
as
his
writing
appears
down
to
its
minutest
detail
gissing
yet
managed
to
turn
out
rather
more
than
a
novel
per
annum
the
desire
to
excel
acted
as
a
spur
which
conquered
his
congenital
inclination
to
dreamy
historical
reverie

reward

himself

the

of

in

time
just
books
have
been
issued

his

industry

worthy
of

flung

little
for

knowing
full
well
that
the
emotional
energy
of
their
temperaments
was
capable
of
fusing

most
intractable
material

their

that
the
man
out
of
whose

such
bitter
experiences
of
the

poor
were
wrung
had
learnt
in
suffering
what
he
taught
in
his
novels
his
start
in
literature
was
made
under
conditions
that
might
have
appalled
the
bravest
and
for
years
his
steps
were
dogged
by
hunger
and
hardships
he
lived
in
cellars

time
he
writes
in
just
such
a
garret
as
that
in

might
the
author
call
this
a

this

no
fancy
picture

a
true
story
of
what
gissing
had
sufficient
elasticity
of
humour
to
call
pretty

as

of
the
ordinary
man
though
under

he
is
abashed
by
youth
he
is
sentimental
and
hungry
for

he
realises
that
the

who
may
with
safety
be
taken
in

by
a
poor
man

extremely
difficult

is

abjures
his
own
past
the
ghost
of
his
former
self
affected
him
with
horror
identity
even
he
denies
can
one
be
responsible
for
the
thoughts
and
acts
of
the
being
who
bore
his
name
years
ago
he
has
no
consciousness
of
his
youth
no
sympathy
with
children
in
him
is
to
be
discerned
father
intellectual
and
emotional
qualities
together
with
a
certain
stiffness
of
moral
attitude
derived
from
his
mother
he
reveals
already
a
wonderful
palate
for
pure
literary
flavour
his
prejudices
are
intense
their
character
being
determined
by
the
refinement
and
idealism
of
his
nature
all
this
is
profoundly
significant
knowing
as
we
do
that
this
was
produced
when
gissing
worldly
prosperity
was
at
its
nadir
he
was
living
at
the
time
like
his
own
harold
biffen
in
absolute
solitude
a
frequenter
of
pawnbroker
shops
and
a
stern
connoisseur
of
pure
dripping
pease
pudding
pennyworths
at
a
shop
in
cleveland
street
of
a
very
rich
quality
indeed
faggots
and
saveloys
the
stamp
of
affluence
in
those
days
was
the
possession
of
a
basin
the
rich
man
thus
secured
the
gravy
which
the
poor
man
who
relied
on
a
paper
wrapper
for
his
pease
pudding
had
to
give
away
the
image
recurred
to
his
mind
when
in
later
days
he
discussed
champagne
vintages
with
his
publisher
or
was
consulted
as
to
the
management
of
butlers
by
the
wife
of
a
popular
prelate
with
what
a
sincere
recollection
of
this
time
he
enjoins
his
readers
after
johnson
to
abstain
from
poverty
is
the
great
secluder
is
a
wilderness
abounding
in
anchorites
gissing
was
sustained
amid
all
these
miseries
by
two
passionate
idealisms
one
of
the
intellect
the
other
of
the
emotions
the
first
was
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
he
incarnated
this
passion
in
the
picturesque
figure
of
julian
casti
in
toiling
hard
to
purchase
a
gibbon
savouring
its
grand
epic
roll
converting
its
driest
detail
into
poetry
by
means
of
his
enthusiasm
and
selecting
stilicho

a

of

the
best

account
i
think
is
to
be
gleaned
from
the
concluding
chapters
of

this
may
be
reinforced

to
some

corrected

he
had
come
thither
from
wakefield
at
the
age
of
thirteen
after
the
death
of
his
father
who
was
in
a
double
sense
the
cardinal
formative
influence
in
his
life
the
tones
of
his
father
voice
his

gestures
never
departed
from
him
when
he
read

it

could
draw
in
those
days

great
skill
and
vigour
it
will
seem
significant
to
many
that
he
was
particularly
fascinated
by
hogarth

and
that
he
copied
and
imitated
it
and
his

his

had
quickened
his

and
given
it
its
enduring
bias
for

like

sterne
borrow
dickens
eliot
is
half
involuntarily
almost
unconsciously
autobiographic
without
awe
did
i
see
the
picture
of
the
room
which
was
now
tenantless
i
remember
too
a
curiosity
which
led
me
to
look
closely
at
the
and
the
objects
upon
it
at
the
comfortable
chair
at
the
behind
i
began
to
ask
myself
how
books
were
written
and
how
the
men
lived
who
wrote
them
it
is
my
last
glimpse
of
childhood
six
months
later
there
was
an
empty
chair
in
my
own
home
and
the
tenor
of
my
life
was
broken
years
after
this
i
found
myself
amid
the
streets
of
london
and
had
to
find
the
means
of
keeping
myself
alive
what
i
chiefly
thought
of
was
that
now
at
length
i
could
go
hither
or
thither
in
immensity
seeking
for
the
places
which
had
been
made
known
to
me
by
dickens
day
in
the
city
i
found
myself
at
the
entrance
to
bevis
marks
i
had
just
been
making
an
application
in
reply
to
some
advertisement
of
course
fruitlessly
but
what
was
that
disappointment
compared
with
the
discovery
of
bevis
marks
here
dwelt
brass
and
sally
and
the
marchioness
up
and
down
the
little
street
this
side
and
that
i
went
gazing
and
dreaming
no
press
of
busy
folk
disturbed
me
the
place
was
quiet
it
looked
no
doubt
much
the
same
as
when
dickens
knew
it
i
am
not
sure
that
i
had
any
dinner
that
day
but
if
not
i
daresay
i
did
not
mind
it
very
much
the
broad
flood
under
thames
bridges
spoke
to
him
in
the
very
tones
of
master
he
breathed
guppy
london
particular
the
wind
was
the
black
easter
that
pierced
the
diaphragm
of
scrooge
clerk
bookish
people
have
our
connotations
for
the
life
we
do
not
live
in
time
i
came
to
see
london
with
my
own
eyes
but
how
much
better
when
i
saw
it
with
those
of
dickens
tired
and
discouraged
badly
nourished
badly
housed
working
under
conditions
little
favourable
to
play
of
the
fancy
or
intentness
of
the
mind
then
was
the
time
gissing
found
to
take
down
forster
and
read
read
about
charles
dickens
as
the
narrative
of
a
wonderfully
active
zealous
and
successful
life
this
book
scarce
has
its
equal
almost
any
reader
must
find
it
exhilarating
but
to
me
it
yielded
such
special
sustenance
as
in
those
days
i
could
not
have
found
elsewhere
and
lacking
which
i
should
perhaps
have
failed
by
the
way
i
am
not
referring
to
dickens
swift
triumph
to
his
resounding
fame
and
high
prosperity
these
things
are
cheery
to
read
about
especially
when
shown
in
a
light
so
human
with
the
accompaniment
of
so
much
geniality
and
mirth
no
the
pages
which
invigorated
me
are
those
where
we
see
dickens
at
work
alone
at
his
absorbed
in
the
task
of
the
constantly
he
makes
known
to
forster
how
his
story
is
getting
on
speaks
in
detail
of
difficulties
rejoices
over
spells
of
happy
labour
and
what
splendid
sincerity
in
it
all
if
this
work
of
his
was
not
worth
doing
why
nothing
was
a
troublesome
letter
has
arrived
by
the
morning
post
and
threatens
to
spoil
the
day
but
he
takes
a
few
turns
up
and
down
the
room
shakes
off
the
worry
and
sits
down
to
write
for
hours
and
hours
he
is
at
the
his
desk
at
a
sunny
bay
window
overlooking
the
shore
and
there
all
the
morning
he
writes
with
gusto
ever
and
again
bursting
into
laughter
at
his
own
thoughts
footnote
see
a
deeply
interesting
paper
on
dickens
by
in
the
new
york
much
of
this
is
avowed
autobiography
the
influence
of
dickens
clearly
predominated
when
gissing
wrote
his
next
novel
and
first
really
notable
and
artistic
book
the
figure
which
irradiates
this
story
is
evidently
designed
in
the
school
of
dickens
it
might
almost
be
a
pastel
after
some
more
highly
finished
work
by
daudet
but
daudet
is
a
more
relentless
observer
than
gissing
and
to
find
a
parallel
to
this
particular
effect
i
think
we
must
go
back
a
little
farther
to
the
heroic
age
of
the
and
the
tearful
de
of
henri
murger
at
any
rate
is
a
most
exquisite
picture
in
of
grey
and
purple
of
a
little
madonna
of
the
slums
she
is
in
reality
the
fleur
of
which
he
speaks
in
the
epigraph
of
the
the
in
question
is
lambeth
walk
of
which
we
have
a
saturday
night
scene
worthy
of
the
author
of
and
ventre
de
in
his
most
perceptive
mood
in
this
inferno
amongst
the
pungent
odours
musty
smells
and
exhalations
from
the
shops
where
fried
fish
and
potatoes
hissed
in
boiling
grease
blossomed
a
pure
white
lily
as
radiant
amid
mean
surroundings
as
gemma
in
the
poor
frankfort
confectioner
shop
of
turgenev
the
pale
and
rather
languid
charm
of
her
face
and
figure
are
sufficiently
portrayed
without
any
set
description
what
could
be
more
delicate
than
the
intimation
of
the
foregone
between
the
sisters
or
the
scene
of
lyddy
plaiting
thyrza
hair
the
delineation
of
the
upper
middle
class
culture
by
which
this
exquisite
flower
of
maidenhood
is
first
caressed
and
transplanted
then
slighted
and
left
to
wither
is
not
so
satisfactory
of
the
upper
middle
class
indeed
at
that
time
gissing
had
very
few
means
of
observation
but
this
defect
common
to
all
his
early
novels
is
more
than
compensated
by
the
intensely
pathetic
figure
of
gilbert
grail
the
factory
hand
raised
for
a
moment
to
the
prospect
of
intellectual
life
and
then
hurled
down
by
the
caprice
of
circumstance
to
the
unrelenting
round
of
manual
toil
at
the
soap
and
candle
factory
dickens
would
have
given
a
touch
of
the
grotesque
to
gentle
but
ungainly
character
but
at
the
end
he
would
infallibly
have
rewarded
him
as
tom
pinch
and
dominie
sampson
were
rewarded
not
so
george
gissing
his
sympathy
is
fully
as
real
as
that
of
dickens
but
his
fidelity
to
fact
is
greater
of
the
christmas
charity
prescribed
by
dickens
and
of
the
untainted
pathos
to
which
he
too
rarely
attained
there
is
an
abundance
in
but
what
amazes
the
chronological
student
of
gissing
work
is
the
magnificent
quality
of
some
of
the
writing
a
quality
of
which
he
had
as
yet
given
no
very
definite
promise
take
the
following
passage
for
example
footnote
a
in
later
life
we
are
told
that
gissing
affected
to
despise
this
book
as
piece
of
boyish
idealism
but
he
was
always
greatly
pleased
by
any
praise
of
this
of
two
sisters
where
poverty
for
once
is
by
love
my
impression
is
that
it
was
written
before
but
was
longer
in
finding
a
publisher
it
had
to
wait
until
the
way
was
prepared
by
its
coarser
and
more
vigorous
workfellow
a
friend
writes
well
remember
the
appearance
of
the
gissing
wrote
then
on
thin
foreign
paper
in
a
small
thin
handwriting
without
correction
it
was
before
the
days
of
typewriting
and
the
of
a
novel
was
so
compressed
that
one
could
literally
put
it
in
one
pocket
without
the
slightest
inconvenience
the
name
is
from
byron
on
street
organ
began
to
play
in
front
of
a
close
by
grail
drew
near
there
were
children
forming
a
dance
and
he
stood
to
watch
them
do
you
know
that
music
of
the
obscure
ways
to
which
children
dance
not
if
you
have
only
heard
it
ground
to
your
ears
affliction
beneath
your
windows
in
the
square
to
hear
it
aright
you
must
stand
in
the
darkness
of
such
a
as
this
and
for
the
moment
be
at
one
with
those
who
dwell
around
in
the
houses
in
the
dim
burrows
of
poverty
in
the
unmapped
haunts
of
the
then
you
will
know
the
significance
of
that
vulgar
clanging
of
melody
a
pathos
of
which
you
did
not
dream
will
touch
you
and
therein
the
secret
of
hidden
london
will
be
half
revealed
the
life
of
men
who
toil
without
hope
yet
with
the
hunger
of
an
unshaped
desire
of
women
in
whom
the
sweetness
of
their
sex
is
perishing
under
labour
and
misery
the
laugh
the
song
of
the
girl
who
strives
to
enjoy
her
year
or
two
of
youthful
vigour
knowing
the
darkness
of
the
years
to
come
the
careless
defiance
of
the
youth
who
feels
his
blood
and
revolts
against
the
lot
which
would
tame
it
all
that
is
purely
human
in
these
darkened
multitudes
speaks
to
you
as
you
listen
it
is
the
striving
of
a
nature
which
knows
not
what
it
would
attain
which
deforms
a
true
thought
by
gross
expression
which
clutches
at
the
beautiful
and
soils
it
with
foul
hands
the
children
were
dirty
and
ragged
several
of
them
barefooted
nearly
all
but
they
danced
with
noisy
merriment
one
there
was
a
little
girl
on
crutches
incapable
of
taking
a
partner
she
stumped
round
and
round
circling
upon
the
pavement
till
giddiness
came
upon
her
and
she
had
to
fall
back
and
lean
against
the
wall
laughing
aloud
at
her
weakness
gilbert
stepped
up
to
her
and
put
a
penny
into
her
hand
then
before
she
had
recovered
from
her
surprise
passed
p
this
superb
piece
of
imaginative
prose
of
which
shorthouse
himself
might
have
been
proud
is
recalled
by
an
answering
note
in
in
which
he
says
owe
many
a
page
to
the
and
where
the
pathos
has
to
be
distilled
from
dialogue
i
doubt
if
the
author
of
himself
could
have
written
anything
more
restrainedly
touching
or
in
a
finer
taste
than
this
footnote
i
am
thinking
in
particular
of
the
old
conversation
in
chap
xxiii
of
of
the
exquisite
passage
on
old
dance
music
its
inexpressible
pathos
in
chap
xxv
with
kindly
mirth
the
old
man
drew
on
his
woollen
gloves
and
took
up
his
hat
and
the
then
he
offered
to
say
but
you
forgetting
your
grandad
said
lydia
i
did
come
in
it
my
dear
what
that
then
i
sure
do
wear
such
things
she
pointed
to
a
chair
on
which
thyrza
had
just
artfully
spread
the
gift
boddy
looked
in
a
puzzled
way
had
he
really
come
in
his
coat
and
forgotten
it
he
drew
nearer
that
no
coat
o
mine
lyddy
he
said
thyrza
broke
into
a
laugh
why
whose
is
it
then
she
exclaimed
do
play
tricks
grandad
put
it
on
at
once
now
come
come
you
keeping
mary
waiting
said
lydia
catching
up
the
coat
and
holding
it
ready
then
boddy
understood
he
looked
from
lydia
to
thyrza
with
dimmed
eyes
i
a
good
mind
never
to
speak
to
either
of
you
again
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
as
if
you
had
need
enough
of
your
money
lyddy
lyddy
and
you
as
had
thyrza
a
grownup
woman
like
you
you
ought
to
teach
your
sister
better
why
there
it
no
good
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
mary
lydia
still
held
up
the
coat
and
at
length
persuaded
the
old
man
to
don
it
the
effect
upon
his
appearance
was
remarkable
conscious
of
it
he
held
himself
more
upright
and
stumped
to
the
little
square
of
to
try
and
regard
himself
here
he
furtively
brushed
a
hand
over
his
eyes
i
ready
mary
my
dear
i
ready
it
no
good
saying
anything
to
girls
like
these
lyddy
thyrza
may
you
have
a
happy
christmas
children
this
is
the
first
as
you
made
a
happy
one
for
p
the
anonymously
published
can
hardly
be
described
as
a
typical
product
of
george
gissing
mind
and
art
in
it
he
subdued
himself
rather
to
the
level
of
such
popular
producers
as
besant
and
rice
and
went
out
of
his
way
to
procure
melodramatic
suspense
an
ingredient
far
from
congenial
to
his
normal
artistic
temper
but
the
end
justified
the
means
the
novel
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
author
of
lost
sir
and
gissing
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
found
himself
the
possessor
of
a
full
purse
with
fifty
tingling
golden
minted
quid
in
it
its
possession
brought
with
it
the
realisation
of
a
paramount
desire
the
desire
for
greece
and
italy
which
had
become
for
him

spent

he
could
afford
about

came
on
with
a
rejoicing
heart
to
rome
rome
whose

had
been
with
him
since
boyhood
beside
whose
stately
history
the
confused
tumult

seemed
to
him
no

a
noisy
unmeaning
persecution

he

employed
for
renewed
recollections
of
tibullus

of

may
have
served
to
give
his
work
a
more
idyllic

there
were
much
nearer
sources
of
inspiration
for

there
must
be
many
novels
inspired
by
a
youthful
enthusiasm

this

should
take
to
be
one
of
them
apart
from
the
idyllic
purity
of
its
tone
and
its
sincere
idolatry
of
youthful
love
the
caressing
grace
of

the
spiritualised

of

to

not

obviously
padded
with
the

substitute
for

palpably
imitated
from

to

of

one
could
linger
for

her
fairest

glorious
savagery

kingdom
of

moors
in
spain

magic
of
renaissance
italy
to
become
a
citizen
of
any
one
age
means
a
lifetime
of
endeavour
it
is
easy
to
fill
one
head
with
names
and
years
but
that
only
sharpens
my
hunger
in
one
form
or
another
it
recurs
in
practically
every
novel
certain
of
the
later
portions
of
this
book
especially
the
chapter
entitled
path
in
shadow
are
delineated
through
a
kind
of
mystical
haze
suggestive
of
some
of
the
work
of
puvis
de
chavannes
the
concluding
chapters
taken
as
a
whole
indicate
with
tolerable
accuracy
gissing
affinities
as
a
writer
and
the
pedigree
of
the
type
of
novel
by
which
he
is
best
known
it
derives
from
xavier
de
maistre
and
pierre
to
nouvelle
héloïse
nay
might
one
not
almost
say
from
the
du
of
princesse

theories
as
to
the
relations
of
the
sexes
the
dangers
of
indiscriminate
education
the
corruptions
of
wretchedness
and
poverty
in
large
towns
the
neglect
of
literature
and
classical
learning
and
the
grievances
of
scholarly
refinement
in
a
world
in
which
greek
iambic
and
latin
hexameter
count
for
nothing
such
form
the
staple
of
his
theses
and
tirades
his
approximation
at
times
to
the
confines
of
french
realistic
art
is
of
the
most
accidental
or
incidental
kind
for
gissing
is
at
heart
in
his
bones
as
the
vulgar
say
a
thorough
moralist
and
sentimentalist
an
honest
downright
ineradicable
englishman
intellectually
his
own
life
was
and
continued
to
the
last
to
be
romantic
to
an
extent
that
few
lives
are
pessimistic
he
may
at
times
appear
but
this
is
almost
entirely
on
the
surface
for
he
was
never
in
the
least
blasé
or
ennuyé
he
had
the
pathetic
treasure
of
the
humble
and
downcast
and
unkindly
entreated
unquenchable
hope
he
has
no
objectivity
his
point
of
view
is
almost
entirely
personal
it
is
not
the
but
the
dierum
that
makes
his
pages
often
so
forlorn
his
laments
are
all
uttered
by
the
waters
of
babylon
in
a
strange
land
his
nostalgia
in
the
land
of
exile
estranged
from
every
refinement
was
greatly
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
he
could
not
get
on
with
ordinary
men
but
exhibited
almost
to
the
last
a
practical
incapacity
a
curious
inability
to
do
the
sane
and
secure
thing
as
wells
puts
it
footnote
sometimes
however
as
in
with
a
very
significant
change
of
intonation
that
history
which
he
loved
to
read
what
was
it
but
the
lurid
record
of
woes
unutterable
how
could
he
find
pleasure
in
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
century

torment

is
not
that
he
was
a
careless
man
he
was
a
most
careful
one
it

not
that

morally
lax
man

almost
morbidly
the
reverse
neither
was
he
morose

eccentric
in

he

some
sort
of
blindness

that

it
up

always
been
full
of
worrying

me
i

take
things
in
the
simple
way
that
comes
natural
to
other
men
as
other
men
are
more
intellectual
than
most
fully
as
responsive
to
kind
and
genial
instincts
yet
bound
at
every
turn
to
pinch
and
screw
an
involuntary
ascetic
such
is
the
essential
burden
of
gissing
lament
only
accidentally
can
it
be
described
as
his
mission
to
preach
desolation
of
modern
life
or
in
the
gracious
phrase
of
de
goncourt
les
entrailles
de
la
of
the
confident
realism
of
for
instance
how
little
is
there
in
any
of
his
work
even
in
that
most
gloomily
photographic
portion
of
it
which
we
are
now
to
describe
during
the
next
four
years
gissing
produced
four
novels
and
three
of
these
perhaps
are
his
best
efforts
in
prose
fiction
nether
of
is
certainly
in
some
respects
his
strongest
work
letra
con
in
which
the
ruddy
drops
of
anguish
remembered
in
a
state
of
comparative
tranquillity
are
most
powerfully
expressed
of
is
with
equal
certainty
a
and
the
least
successful
of
various
attempts
to
give
utterance
to
his
enthusiasm
for
the
glory
that
was
greece
and
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
grub
is
the
most
constructive
and
perhaps
the
most
successful
of
all
his
works
while
in
is
a
as
regards
the
development
of
the
author
character
a
of
primary
value
to
his
future
biographer
whoever
he
may
be
the
contains
gissing
most
convincing
indictment
of
poverty
and
it
also
expresses
his
sense
of
revolt
against
the
ugliness
and
cruelty
which
is
propagated
like
a
foul
weed
by
the
barbarous
life
of
our
reeking
slums
hunger
and
want
show
religion
and
virtue
the
door
with
scant
politeness
in
this
terrible
book
the
material
had
been
in
his
possession
for
some
time
and
in
part
it
had
been
used
before
in
earlier
work
it
was
now
utilised
with
a
masterly
hand
and
the
result
goes
some
way
perhaps
to
justify
the
but
erratic
comparisons
that
have
been
made
between
gissing
and
such
writers
as
zola
maupassant
and
the
projector
of
the
the
savage
luck
which
dogs
kirkwood
and
jane
and
the
worse
than
savage
the
inhuman
cruelty
of
clem
peckover
who
has
been
compared
to
the
madame
cibot
of
balzac
cousin
render
the
book
an
intensely
gloomy
one
it
ends
on
a
note
of
poignant
misery
which
gives
a
certain
colour
for
once
to
the
charge
of
morbidity
and
pessimism
gissing
understood
the
theory
of
compensation
but
was
unable
to
exhibit
it
in
action
he
elevates
the
cult
of
refinement
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
consolations
of
temperament
of
habit
and
of
humdrum
ideals
which
are
common
to
the
coarsest
of
mankind
appear
to
elude
his
observation
he
does
not
represent
men
as
worse
than
they
are
but
he
represents
them
less
brave
no
social
stratum
is
probably
quite
so
dull
as
he
colours
it
there
is
usually
a
streak
of
illusion
or
a
flash
of
hope
somewhere
on
the
horizon
hence
a
somewhat
view
of
life
perfectly
true
as
representing
the
grievance
of
the
poet
cinna
in
the
hands
of
the
mob
but
too
severely
monochrome
for
a
serious
indictment
of
a
huge
stratum
of
our
common
humanity
as
in
the
sombreness
of
the
ground
generates
some
magnificent
pieces
of
descriptive
writing
yet
before
the
fireworks
begin
never

here
by
good
luck
we
find
seats
where
we
can
watch
the
throng

and
repassing

a
great
review
of
the
people
on
the
whole
how
respectable
they
are
how
sober
how
deadly

how
the
poor

yards

the
dawn

pp
from
the
delineation
of
this
profoundly
depressing
milieu
by
the
aid
of
which
if
the
fate
of
london
and
liverpool
were
as
that
of
herculaneum
and
pompeii
we
should
be
able
to
reconstruct

of
our
imperial
cities
little
changed
in
essentials
since
the
days
of
domitian
gissing
turned
his
to
the
scenery
of
rural
england
he
makes
no
attempt
at
the
rich
colouring
of
kingsley
or
blackmore
but
as
page
after
page
of
testifies
twelve
years
later
he
is
a
perfect
master
of
the
distance
is
about
five
miles
and
until
danbury
hill
is
reached
the
countryside
has
no
point
of
interest
to
distinguish
it
from
any
other
representative
bit
of
rural
essex
it
is
merely
one
of
those
quiet
corners
of
flat
homely
england
where
man
and
beast
seem
on
good
terms
with
each
other
where
all
green
things
grow
in
abundance
where
from
of
old
tilth
and
are
humbly
observant
of
seasons
and
alternations
where
the
brown
roads
are
familiar
only
with
the
tread
of
the
labourer
with
the
light
wheel
of
the
farmer
gig
or
the
rumbling
of
the
solid
wain
by
the
roadside
you
pass
occasionally
a
mantled
pool
where
perchance
ducks
or
geese
are
enjoying
themselves
and
at
times
there
is
a
pleasant
glimpse
of
farmyard
with
stacks
and
barns
and
stables
all
things
as
simple
as
could
be
but
beautiful
on
this
summer
afternoon
and
priceless
when
one
has
come
forth
from
the
streets
of
clerkenwell
hill
rising
to
the
village
church
which
is
visible
for
miles
around
with
stretches
of
heath
about
its
lower
slopes
with
its
far
prospects
over
the
sunny
country

the
pleasant
end
of
a
pleasant
drive
nether
pp
the
first
part
of
this
description
is
quite
masterly
worthy
i
am
inclined
to
say
of
flaubert
but
unless
you
are
familiar
with
the
quiet
undemonstrative
nature
of
the
scenery
described
you
can
hardly
estimate
the
perfect
justice
of
the
sentiment
and
phrasing
with
which
gissing
succeeds
in
enveloping
it
gissing
now
turned
to
the
submerged
tenth
of
literature
and
in
describing
it
he
managed
to
combine
a
problem
or
thesis
with
just
the
amount
of
characterisation
and
plotting
sanctioned
by
the
novel
convention
of
the
day
the
convention
may
have
been
better
than
we
think
for
grub
is
certainly
its
author
most
effective
work
the
characters
are
numerous
actual
and
alive
the
plot
is
moderately
good
and
lingers
in
the
memory
with
some
obstinacy
the
problem
is
more
open
to
criticism
and
it
has
indeed
been
criticised
from
more
points
of
view
than
one
grub
says
one
of
his
critics
gissing
has
endeavoured
to
depict
the
shady
side
of
literary
life
in
an
age
dominated
by
the
commercial
spirit
on
the
whole
it
is
in
its
realism
perhaps
the
least
convincing
of
his
novels
whilst
being
undeniably
the
most
depressing
it
is
not
that
gissing
picture
of
poverty
in
the
literary
profession
is
wanting
in
the
elements
of
truth
although
even
in
that
profession
there
is
even
more
eccentricity
than
the
author
leads
us
to
suppose
in
the
social
position
and
evil
plight
of
such
men
as
edwin
reardon
and
harold
biffen
but
the
contrast
between
edwin
reardon
the
conscientious
artist
loving
his
art
and
working
for
its
sake
and
jasper
milvain
the
man
of
letters
who
prospers
simply
because
he
is
also
a
man
of
business
which
is
the
main
feature
of
the
book
and
the
principal
support
of
its
theme
strikes
one
throughout
as
strained
to
the
point
of
unreality
in
the
first
place
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
a
man
of
milvain
mind
and
instincts
should
have
deliberately
chosen
literature
as
the
occupation
of
his
life
with
money
and
success
as
his
only
aim
he
would
surely
have
become
a
stockbroker
or
a
moneylender
in
the
second
place
edwin
dire
failure
with
his
rapid
descent
into
extreme
poverty
is
clearly
traceable
not
so
much
to
a
truly
artistic
temperament
in
conflict
with
the
commercial
spirit
as
to
mental
and
moral
weakness
which
could
not
but
have
a
baneful
influence
upon
his
work

this
criticism
does
not
seem
to
me
a
just
one
at
all
and
i
dissent
from
it
completely
in
the
first
place
the
book
is
not
nearly
so
depressing
as
nether
and
is
much
farther
removed
from
the
strain
of
french
and
russian
pessimism
which
had
begun
to
engage
the
author
study
when
he
was
writing
there
are
dozens
of
examples
to
prove
that
success
is
a
perfectly
normal
process
and
the
reason
for
his
selecting
the
journalistic
career
is
the
obvious
one
that
he
has
no
money
to
begin
still
less
in
the
third
place
the
mental
and
moral
shortcomings
of
reardon
are
by
no
means
dissembled
by
the
author
he
is
as
the
careful
student
of
the
novels
will
perceive
a
greatly
strengthened
and
improved
rifacimento
of
kingcote
while
amy
reardon
is
a
better
observed
isabel
regarded
from
a
slightly
different
point
of
view
jasper
milvain
is
to
my
thinking
a
perfectly
fair
portrait
of
an
ambitious
publicist
or
journalist
of
the
day
destined
by
determination
skill
energy
and
social
ambition
to
become
an
editor
of
a
successful
journal
or
review
and
to
lead
the
life
of
central
london
possessing
a
keen
and
active
mind
expression
on
paper
is
his
handle
he
has
no
love
of
letters
as
letters
at
all
but
his
outlook
upon
the
situation
is
just
enough
reardon
has
barely
any
outlook
at
all
he
is
a
man
with
a
delicate
but
shallow
vein
of
literary
capacity
who
never
did
more
than
tremble
upon
the
verge
of
success
and
hardly
if
at
all
went
beyond
promise
he
was
unlucky
in
marrying
amy
a
rather
heartless
woman
whose
ambition
was
far
in
excess
of
her
insight
for
economic
position
reardon
had
none
he
writes
books
to
please
a
small
group
the
books
fail
to
please
jasper
in
the
main
is
right
there
is
only
a
precarious
place
for
any
creative
litterateur
between
the
genius
and
the
swarm
of
ephemera
or
journalists
a
man
writes
either
to
please
the
hour
or
to
produce
something
to
last
relatively
a
long
time
several
generations
what
we
call
the
intermediate
position
is
necessarily
insecure
it
is
not
really
wanted
what
is
lost
by
society
when
one
of
these
mediocre
masterpieces
is
overlooked
a
sensation
a
single
ray
in
a
sunset
missed
by
a
small
literary
coterie
the
circle
is
perhaps
eclectic
it
may
seem
hard
that
good
work
is
overwhelmed
in
the
cataract
of
production
while
relatively
bad
garish
work
is
rewarded
but
so
it
must
be
growing
flood
of
literature
swamps
every
thing
but
works
of
primary
genius
good
taste
is
valuable
especially
when
it
takes
the
form
of
good
criticism
the
best
critics
of
contemporary
books
and
these
are
by
no
means
identical
with
the
best
critics
of
the
past
and
its
work
are
those
who
settle
intuitively
upon
the
writing
that
is
going
to
appeal
more
largely
to
a
future
generation
when
the
attraction
of
novelty
and
topicality
has
subsided
the
same
work
is
done
by
great
men
they
anticipate
lines
of
action
philosophers
generally
follow
theories
the
practice
of
louis
nietzsche
that
of
napoleon
the
critic
recognises
the
tentative
steps
of
genius
in
letters
the
work
of
fine
delicacy
and
reserve
the
work
that
follows
lacking
the
real
originality
is
liable
to
neglect
and
become
the
victim
of
unfair
influence
or
other
extraneous
factors
yet
on
the
whole
so
numerous
are
the
publics
of
there
never
perhaps
was
a
time
when
supreme
genius
or
even
supreme
talent
was
so
sure
of
recognition
those
who
rail
against
these
conditions
as
gissing
seems
here
to
have
done
are
actuated
consciously
or
unconsciously
by
a
personal
or
sectional
disappointment
it
is
akin
to
the
crocodile
lament
of
the
publisher
that
good
modern
literature
is
neglected
by
the
public
or
the
lament
about
the
great
unpaid
greatness
of
the
great
unknown
the
exclusively
literary
view
of
literary
rewards
literature
must
be
governed
by
impulse
or
directed
at

rich
in
memorable
characters
and

an
extent
unusual
in

biffen

a
piece
of
genre
almost
worthy

listening
in
despair
to

a
vignette
worthy
of

alfred

veteran

literary
ideals
are
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
a
most
extraordinary
study
of
an
certainly
one
of
the
most
crusted
and
individual
personalities
gissing
ever
portrayed
he
never
wrote
with
such
a
virile
pen

phrase
bites
and
snaps
with
a
singular
crispness

energy
material
used
before

now
brought

a
finer
literary
issue
it
is
by
far
the
most
tenacious

it
shows
that
on
the
more
conventional
lines
of
fictitious
intrigue
acting
as
cement
and
in
the
interplay
of

gissing

of

now
so
familiar
about

going
off

typical
of
a
lifelong

biffen
it

is
a
somewhat
fantastic
figure
of
an
idealist
but
gissing
cherished
this
grotesque
exfoliation
from
a
headline
by
dickens
and
later
in
his
career
we
shall
find
him
reproducing
one
of
biffen
ideals
with
a
singular
fidelity
a
woman
of
middle
age
wrapped
at
all
times
in
dirty
rags
not
to
be
called
clothing
obese
grimy
with
dishevelled
black
hair
and
hands
so
scarred
so
deformed
by
labour
and
neglect
as
to
be
scarcely
human
she
had
the
darkest
and
fiercest
eyes
i
ever
saw
between
her
and
her
mistress
went
on
an
unceasing
quarrel
they
quarrelled
in
my
room
in
the
corridor
and
as
i
knew
by
their
shrill
voices
in
places
remote
yet
i
am
sure
they
did
not
dislike
each
other
and
probably
neither
of
them
ever
thought
of
parting
unexpectedly
one
evening
this
woman
entered
stood
by
the
bedside
and
began
to
talk
with
such
fierce
energy
with
such
flashing
of
her
black
eyes
and
such
distortion
of
her
features
that
i
could
only
suppose
that
she
was
attacking
me
for
the
trouble
i
caused
her
a
minute
or
two
passed
before
i
could
even
hit
the
drift
of
her
furious
speech
she
was
always
the
most
difficult
of
the
natives
to
understand
and
in
rage
she
became
quite
unintelligible
little
by
little
by
dint
of
questioning
i
got
at
what
she
meant
there
had
been
worse
than
usual
the
mistress
had
reviled
her
unendurably
for
some
fault
or
other
and
was
it
not
hard
that
she
should
be
used
like
this
after
having
tanto
in
fact
she
was
appealing
for
my
sympathy
not
abusing
me
at
all
when
she
went
on
to
say
that
she
was
alone
in
the
world
that
all
her
kith
and
kin
were
stone
dead
a
pathos
in
her
aspect
and
her
words
took
hold
upon
me
it
was
much
as
if
some
beast
of
burden
had
suddenly
found
tongue
and
protested
in
the
rude
beginnings
of
articulate
utterance
against
its
hard
lot
if
only
we
could
have
learnt
in
intimate
detail
the
life
of
this
domestic
serf
how
interesting
and
how
sordidly
picturesque
against
the
background
of
romantic
landscape
of
scenic
history
i
looked
long
into
her
sallow
wrinkled
face
trying
to
imagine
the
thoughts
that
ruled
its
expression
in
some
measure
my
efforts
at
kindly
speech
succeeded
and
her
ah
cristo
as
she
turned
to
go
away
was
not
without
a
touch
of
solace

ionian
chap

in

was
already
beginning
to
try
and
discard
his
down
look
his
lugubrious

lamentable
cadence
he
found
some
alleviation
from

and
he
determined
to
borrow
a
feather
from

in
other
words
to
place
an
autobiographical
novel
to
his
credit
the
result
was
in

of
the
last
of
the
novels
by
no
means
one
of
the
worst
a
hedonist

the
natural

externals
of
refinement
the

the
ferocity
with
which
this

manifest
itself

fortifying

footnote
with
an
exhibition

when

was
not

the
year
of
this
autobiographical
record
marked
the
commencement
of
gissing
reclamation
from
that
worst
form
of
literary
slavery
the
for
he
had
been
virtually
chained
to
the
desk
perpetually
working
imprisoned
in
a
london
lodging
owing
to
the
literal
lack
of
the
means
of
locomotion
his
most
strenuous
work
wrung
from
him
in
dismal
darkness
and
wrestling
of
spirit
was
now
achieved
yet
it
seems
to
me
both
ungrateful
and
unfair
to
say
as
has
frequently
been
done
that
his
subsequent
work
was
consistently
inferior
in
his
earlier
years
like
reardon
he
had
destroyed
whole
books
books
he
had
to
sit
down
to
when
his
imagination
was
tired
and
his
fancy
suffering
from
deadly
fatigue
his
corrections
in
the
days
of
grub
provoked
not
infrequent
though
anxiously
deprecated
remonstrance
from
his
publisher
reader
now
he
wrote
with
more
assurance
and
less
exhaustive
care
but
also
with
a
perfected
experience
a
portion
of
his
material
it
is
true
had
been
fairly
used
up
and
he
had
henceforth
to
turn
to
analyse
the
sufferings
of
lower
families
people
who
had
inherited
refinement
nor
acquired
it
neither
proletarian
nor
gentlefolk
consumed
with
a
disease
of
vulgar
pretentiousness
inflated
with
the
miasma
of
democracy
of
these
classes
it
is
possible
that
he
knew
less
and
consequently
lacked
the
sureness
of
touch
and
the
fresh
draughtsmanship
which
comes
from
ample
knowledge
and
that
he
had
consequently
to
have
increasing
resort
to
books
and
to

with
different
degrees
of
success
he
had
succeeded
in
providing
every
one
of
his
theses
with
something
in
the
nature
of
a
plot
which
the
public
loved
and
he
despised
there
remained
to
him
three
alternatives
to
experiment
beyond
the
limits
of
the
novel
to
essay
a
lighter
vein
of
fiction
or
thirdly
to
repeat
himself
and
refashion
old
material
within
its
limits
necessity
left
him
very
little
option
he
adopted
all
three
alternatives
his
best
success
in
the
third
department
was
achieved
in
burrowing
back
into

projection
of
himself

standard

delicacy
to
the

which
would
occupy
a

place
in

repertoire
of
any

it
well
exhibits
the
conflict
between
an
exaggerated
contempt

an
extreme
susceptibility
to
the
charm
of

which
has
cried
havoc
and

loose

him
next
to
sir

the
second
greatest
figure
in
a
century
of
great
fiction
in
defiance
of
the
terrible
and
to
some
critics
damning
fact
that
dickens
entirely
changed
the
plan
of
in
deference
to
the
popular
criticism
expressed
by
the
sudden
fall
in
the
circulation
of
that
serial

shows
in
what
a
fundamental
sense
the
author
was

wrote
the
greater
part
of
his
last
three
books
the
novel
just
mentioned
which
is
probably
his
best
essay
in
the
lighter
ironical
vein
to
which
his
later
years
inclined
a
romance
of
the
time
of
theodoric
the
goth
written
in
solemn
fulfilment
of
a
vow
of
his
youth
and
private
papers
of
henry
which
to
my
mind
remains
a
legacy
for
time
to
take
account
of
as
the
faithful
tribute
of
one
of
the
truest
artists
of
the
generation
he
served
footnote
it
also
contains
one
of
the
most
beautiful
descriptions
ever
penned
of
the
visit
of
a
tired
to
a
modest
rural
home

all
its
suggestion
of
trim

workmanship

of
finest
quality

archaeology
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
worthy
of
becker

boni
sir
walter
himself
could
never
in
reason
have
dared
to
aspire
to
such
a
fortunate
conjuncture
of
talent
grace
and
historic
accuracy
he
possessed
only
that
profound
knowledge
of
human
nature
that
moulding
humour
and
quick
sense
of
dialogue
that
live
human
and
local
interest
in
matters
antiquarian
that
statesmanlike
insight
into
the
pith
and
marrow
of
the
historic
past
which
makes
one
of
scott
historical
novels
what
it
is
the
envy
of
artists
the
delight
of
young
and
old
the
despair
of
formal
historians
is
without
a
doubt
a
splendid
piece
of
work
gissing
wrote
it
with
every
bit
of
the
care
that
his
old
friend
biffen
expended
upon
bailey
he
worked
slowly
patiently
affectionately
scrupulously
each
sentence
was
as
good
as
he
could
make
it
harmonious
to
the
ear
with
words
of
precious
meaning
skilfully
set
and
he
believed
in
it
with
the
illusion
so
indispensable
to
an
artist
wellbeing
and
continuance
in
good
work
it
represented
for
him
what
did
to
flaubert
but
he
could
not
allow
himself
six
years
to
write
a
book
as
flaubert
did
after
all
was
a
magnificent
failure
and
well
it
must
be
confessed
sadly
but
surely
that
was
a
failure
too
far
otherwise
was
it
with
which
represents
as
it
were
the
of
gissing
habitual
meditation
aesthetic
feeling
and
sombre
emotional
experience
not
that
it
is
a
pessimistic
work
quite
the
contrary
it
represents
the
mellowing
influences
the
increase
of
faith
in
simple
unsophisticated
english
girlhood
and
womanhood
in
domestic
pursuits
in
innocent
children
in
rural
homeliness
and
honest
wessex
landscape
which
began
to
operate
about
and
is
seen
so
unmistakably
in
the
closing
scenes
of
three
chief
strains
are
subtly
interblended
in
the
composition
first
that
of
a
nature
book
full
of
air
foliage
and
landscape
that
english
landscape
art
of
linnell
and
de
wint
and
foster
for
which
he
repeatedly
expresses
such
a
passionate
tendre
refreshed
by
from
the
channel
with
raining
scud
and
spume
of
mist
breaking
upon
the
hills
in
which
he
seems
to
crystallise
the
very
essence
of
a
western
winter
secondly
a
paean
half
of
praise
and
half
of
regret
for
the
vanishing
england
passing
so
rapidly
even
as
he
writes
into
new
england
which
tries
so
hard
to
be
unlike
the
old
a
deeper
and
richer
note
of
thankfulness
mixed
as
it
must
be
with
anxiety
for
the
good
old
ways
of
english
life
as
lamented
by
poorgrass
and
mark
clark
old
english
simplicity
and
old
english
fare
the
fine
prodigality
of
the
english
platter
has
never
been
raised
god
grant
that
the
leaven
may
work
and
thirdly
there
is
a
deeply
brooding
strain
of
saddening
yet
softened
autobiographical
reminiscence
over
which
is
thrown
a
light
veil
of
literary
appreciation
and
topical
comment
here
is
a
typical
rising
to
a
swell
at
one
point
suggestive
for
the
moment
of
famous
apostrophe
and
then
most
gently
falling
in
a
manner
not
wholly
unworthy
i
venture
to
think
of
webster
and
sir
thomas
browne
of
both
of
which
authors
there
is
internal
evidence
that
gissing
made
some
study

and
honour

what
with
the
parsons
and
clerks
and
and
serious
the
merry
old
ways
of
good
life
have
gone
to
the
dogs
upon
my
carcass
they
have
from
the
madding
always
turn
out
of
my
way
to
walk
through
a
country
churchyard
these
rural
are
as
attractive
to
me
as
a

cemetery
is
repugnant
i
read
the
names
upon
the
stones
and
find
a
deep
solace
in
thinking
that
for
all
these
the
fret
and
the
fear
of
life
are
over
there
comes
to
me
no
touch
of
sadness
whether
it
be
a
little
child
or
an
aged
man
i
have
the
same
sense
of
happy
accomplishment
the
end
having
come
and
with
it
the
eternal
peace
what
matter
if
it
came
late
or
soon
there
is
no
such
gratulation
as
there
is
no
such
dignity
as
that
of
death
in
the
path
trodden
by
the
noblest
of
mankind
these
have
followed
that
which
of
all
who
live
is
the
utmost
thing
demanded
these
have
achieved
i
can
not
sorrow
for
them
but
the
thought
of
their
vanished
life
moves
me
to
a
brotherly
tenderness
the
dead
amid
this
leafy
silence
seem
to
whisper
encouragement
to
him
whose
fate
yet
lingers
as
we
are
so
shalt
thou
be
and
behold
our
quiet
p
and
in
this
deeply
moving
and
beautiful
passage
we
get
a
foretaste
it
may
be
of
the
euthanasia
following
a
brief
summer
of
martin
for
which
the
scarred
and
troublous
portions
of
gissing
earlier
life
had
served
as
a
preparation
some
there
are
no
doubt
to
whom
it
will
seem
no
extravagance
in
closing
these
private
pages
to
use
the
author
own
words
of
a
more
potent
enchanter
i
close
the
book
love
and
reverence
possess
me
whatever
the
critics
may
determine
as
to
the
merit
of
the
stories
in
the
present
volume
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
interest
they
derive
from
their
connection
with
what
had
gone
before
thus
is
manifestly
the
outcome
of
material
pondered
as
early
as
lodger
in
maze
develops
in
a
most
suggestive
fashion
certain
problems
discussed
in
miss
rodney
is
a
of
rhoda
nunn
and
constance
bride
is
a
delicious
expansion
of
a
mood
indicated
in
spring
xii
and
indicates
the
growing
interest
in
the
business
side
of
practical
life
the
dawn
of
which
is
seen
in
town
and
in
the
discussion
of
potentialities
as
a
capitalist
the
very
artichokes
in
house
of
which
like
the
kindly
hand
that
raised
them
alas
fell
a
victim
to
the
first
frost
of
the
season
are
suggestive
of
a
charming
passage
detailing
the
retired
author
experience
as
a
gardener
what
furnivall
might
call
the
reach
of
every
one
of
these
stories
will
render
their
perusal
delightful
to
those
cultivated
readers
of
gissing
of
whom
there
are
by
no
means
a
few
to
whom
every
fragment
of
his
suave
and
delicate
workmanship
yet
full
of
power
vivid
though
sombre
in
colouring
has
a
technical
interest
and
charm
nor
will
they
search
in
vain
for
gissing
incorrigible
mannerisms
his
haunting
insistence
upon
the
note
of
wo
du
nicht
bist
ist
das
glück
his
tricks
of
the
brush
in
portraiture
his
characteristic
epithets
the
twilight
the
penury
the
ambition
the
wholly
riot
of
the
senses
in
early
manhood
in
my
own
opinion
we
have
here
in
scrupulous
and
to
a
less
degree
perhaps
in
the
first
and
last
of
these
stories
and
in
poor
and
perfectly
characteristic
and
quite
admirable
specimens
of
gissing
own
genre
and
later
unstudied
but
always
finished
prose
style
but
a
few
words
remain
to
be
said
and
these
in
part
at
any
rate
in
recapitulation
in
the
old
race
of
which
dickens
and
thackeray
were
representative
a
successful
determination
to
rise
upon
the
broad
back
of
popularity
coincided
with
a
growing
conviction
that
the
evil
in
the
world
was
steadily
diminishing
like
healthy
schoolboys
who
have
worked
their
way
up
to
the
sixth
form
they
imagined
that
the
bullying
of
which
they
had
had
to
complain
was
become
pretty
much
a
thing
of
the
past
in
gissing
the
misery
inherent
in
the
sharp
contrasts
of
modern
life
was
a
far
more
deeply
ingrained
conviction
he
cared
little
for
the
remedial
aspect
of
the
question
his
idea
was
to
analyse
this
misery
as
an
artist
and
to
express
it
to
the
world
one
of
the
most
impressive
elements
in
the
resulting
novels
is
the
witness
they
bear
to
prolonged
and
intense
suffering
the
suffering
of
a
proud
reserved
and
mind
brought
into
constant
contact
with
the
coarse
and
brutal
facts
of
life
the
creator
of
biffen
suffers
all
the
torture
of
the
fastidious
the
delicately
honourable
the
scrupulously
in
daily
contact
with
persons
of
blunt
feelings
low
ideals
and
base
instincts
cattle
the
herd
that
feed
and
breed
with
them
it
was
well
but
the
few
born
to
a
desire
for
ever
unattainable
the
gentle
spirits
who
from
their
prisoning
circumstance
looked
up
and
afar
how
the
heart
ached
to
think
of
them
the
natural
bent
of
gissing
talent
was
towards
poetry
and
classical
antiquity
his
mind
had
considerable
natural
affinity
with
that
of
tennyson
he
was
passionately
fond
of
old
literature
of
the
study
of
metre
and
of
historical
reverie
the
subtle
curiosities
of
anatole
france
are
just
of
the
kind
that
would
have
appealed
irresistibly
to
him
his
delight
in
psychological
complexity
and
feats
of
style
are
not
seldom
reminiscent
of
paul
bourget
his
life
would
have
gained
immeasurably
by
a
transference
to
less
pinched
and
pitiful
surroundings
but
it
is
more
than
doubtful
whether
his
work
would
have
done
so

the
contemporary
novelist
he
liked
most
was
alphonse
daudet
the
compulsion
of
the
twin
monsters
bread
and
cheese
forced
him
to
write
novels
the
scene
of
which
was
laid
in
the
one
milieu
he
had
thoroughly
observed
that
of
either
utterly
hideous
or
shabby
genteel
squalor
in
london
he
gradually
obtained
a
rare
mastery
in
the
delineation
of
his
unlovely
en
he
gradually
created
a
small
public
who
read
eagerly
everything
that
came
from
his
pen
despite
his
economy
of
material
even
of
ideas
and
despite
the
repetition
to
which
a
natural
tendency
was
increased
by
compulsory
in
all
his
best
books
we
have
evidence
of
the
savage
and
ironical
delight
with
which
he
depicted
to
the
shadow
of
a
hair
the
sordid
and
vulgar
elements
by
which
he
had
been
so
cruelly
depressed
the
aesthetic
observer
who
wanted
material
for
a
picture
of
the
blank
desolation
and
ugliness
of
modern
city
life
could
find
no
better
substratum
than
in
the
works
of
george
gissing
many
of
his
descriptions
of
typical
london
scenes
in
lambeth
walk
clerkenwell
or
judd
street
for
instance
are
the
work
of
a
detached
remorseless
photographic
artist
realising
that
ugly
sordidness
of
daily
life
to
which
the
ordinary
observer
becomes
in
the
course
of
time
as
completely
habituated
as
he
does
to
the
air
to
a
cognate
sentiment
of
revolt
i
attribute
that
excessive
deference
to
scholarship
and
refinement
which
leads
him
in
so
many
novels
to
treat
these
desirable
attributes
as
if
they
were
ends
and
objects
of
life
in
themselves
it
has
also
misled
him
but
too
often
into
depicting
a
world
of
suicides
ignoring
or
overlooking
a
secret
hobby
or
passion
or
chimaera
which
is
the
one
thing
that
renders
existence
endurable
to
so
many
of
the
waifs
and
strays
of
life
he
takes
existence
sadly
too
sadly
it
may
well
be
but
his
drabs
and
greys
provide
an
atmosphere
that
is
almost
inseparable
to
some
of
us
from
our
gaunt
london
streets
in
farringdon
road
for
example
i
look
up
instinctively
to
the
expressionless
upper
windows
where
luckworth
crewe
spreads
his
baits
for
intending
advertisers
a
tram
ride
through
clerkenwell
and
its
leagues
of
dreary
inhospitable
brickwork

take
you
through
the
heart
of
a
region
where
clem

pennyloaf
candy
and
totty
nancarrow
are
multiplied
rather
than
varied
since
they
were
first
depicted
by
george
gissing
as

the
british
museum
it
is
peopled
to
this
day
by
characters
from
grub
there
may
be
a
perceptible
lack
of
virility
a
fluctuating
vagueness
of
outline
about
the
characterisation
of
some
of
his
men
in
his
treatment
of
crowds
in
his
description
of
a
mob
personified
as
huge
beast
purring
to
itself
in
stupid
contentment
he
can
have
few
rivals
in
tracing
the
influence
of
women
over
his
heroes
he
evinces
no
common
subtlety
it
is
here
probably
that
he
is
at
his
best
the
di
to
use
a
phrase
of
don
giovanni
is
a
marked
characteristic
of
his
books
of
the
kisses
hopeless
fancy
feigned
on
lips
that
are
for
others
there
are
indeed
many
to
be
discovered
hidden
away
between
these
pages
and
the
beautiful
verse
has
a
fine
parallel
in
the
prose
of
one
of
later
novels
girl
of
delicate
instinct
of
purpose
sweet
and
pure
wasting
her
unloved
life
in
toil
and
want
and
indignity
some
man
whose
youth
and
courage
strove
against
a
mean
environment
whose
eyes
grew
haggard
in
the
vain
search
for
a
companion
promised
in
his
dreams
they
lived
these
two
parted
perchance
only
by
the
wall
of
neighbour
houses
yet
all
huge
london
was
between
them
and
their
hands
would
never
touch
the
dream
of
fair
women
which
occupies
the
mood
of
piers
otway
in
the
opening
passage
of
the
same
novel
was
evidently
no
remotely
conceived
fancy
its
realisation
in
ideal
love
represents
the
author
of
the
wise
man
who
said
that
beautiful
woman
was
a
heaven
to
the
eye
a
hell
to
the
soul
and
a
purgatory
to
the
purse
of
man
could
hardly
find
a
more
copious
field
of
illustration
than
in
the
fiction
of
george
gissing
footnote
with
unconscious
recollection
it
may
be
of
pope
notable
phrase
in
regard
to
shakespeare
he
speaks
in
his
last
novel
of
woman
appearing
at
times
as
force
of
nature
rather
than
an
individual
p
gissing
was
a
sedulous
artist
some
of
his
books
it
is
true
are
very
hurried
productions
finished
in
haste
for
the
market
with
no
great
amount
either
of
inspiration
or
artistic
confidence
about
them
but
little
slovenly
work
will
be
found
bearing
his
name
for
he
was
a
thoroughly
trained
writer
a
suave
and
seductive
workmanship
had
become
a
second
nature
to
him
and
there
was
always
a
flavour
of
scholarly
subacid
and
modernity
about
his
style
there
is
little
doubt
that
his
quality
as
a
stylist
was
better
adapted
to
the
studies
of
modern
london
life
on
its
seamier
side
which
he
had
observed
at
first
hand
than
to
stories
of
the
conventional
dramatic
structure
which
he
too
often
felt
himself
bound
to
adopt
in
these
his
failure
to
grapple
with
a
big
objective
or
to
rise
to
some
prosperous
situation
is
often
painfully
marked
a
master
of
explanation
and
description
rather
than
of
animated
narrative
or
sparkling
dialogue
he
lacked
the
wit
and
humour
the
brilliance
and
energy
of
a
consummate
style
which
might
have
enabled
him
to
compete
with
the
great
scenic
masters
in
fiction
or
with
craftsmen
such
as
hardy
or
stevenson
or
with
incomparable
wits
and
conversationalists
such
as
meredith
it
is
true
again
that
his
novels
lack
certain
artistic
elements
of
beauty
though
here
and
there
occur
glints
of
rainy
or
sunset
townscape
in
a
consummately
handled
and
eminently
impressive
and
his
intense
sincerity
can
not
wholly
atone
for
this
loss
where
however
a
quiet
refinement
and
delicacy
of
style
is
needed
as
in
those
sane
and
suggestive
atmospheric
critical
or
introspective
studies
such
as
the

p
the
house
of
cobwebs
it
was
five
on
a
june
morning
the
blind
of
the
bedroom
shone
like
cloth
of
gold
as
the
sun
unclouded
rays
poured
through
it
transforming
all
they
illumined
so
that
things
poor
and
mean
seemed
to
share
in
the
triumphant
glory
of
day
in
the
bed
lay
a
young
man
who
had
already
been
awake
for
an
hour
he
kept
stirring
uneasily
but
with
no
intention
of
trying
to
sleep
again
his
eyes
followed
the
slow
movement
of
the
sunshine
on
the
and
noted
as
they
never
had
done
before
the
details
of
the
flower
pattern
which
represented
no
flower
wherewith
botanists
are
acquainted
yet
in
this
summer
light
turned
the
thoughts
to
garden
and
field
and
hedgerow
the
young
man
had
a
troubled
mind
and
his
thoughts
ran
thus
must
have
three
months
at
least
and
how
am
i
to
live
fifteen
shillings
a
week
not
quite
that
if
i
spread
my
money
out
can
one
live
on
fifteen
shillings
a
week
rent
food
washing
i
shall
have
to
leave
these
lodgings
at
once
they
not
luxurious
but
i
ca
live
here
under
that
clear
three
months
to
finish
my
book
it
good
i
hanged
if
it
is
this
time
i
shall
find
a
publisher
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
stick
at
my
work
and
keep
my
mind
easy
lucky
that
it
summer
i
do
need
fires
any
corner
would
do
for
me
where
i
can
be
quiet
and
see
the
sun
wonder
whether
some
cottager
in
surrey
would
house
and
feed
me
for
fifteen
shillings
a
week
no
use
lying
here
better
get
up
and
see
how
things
look
after
an
hour
walk
so
the
young
man
arose
and
clad
himself
and
went
out
into
the
shining
street
his
name
was
goldthorpe
his
years
were
not
yet
since
the
age
of
legal
independence
he
had
been
living
alone
in
london
solitary
and
poor
very
proud
of
a
wholehearted
devotion
to
the
career
of
authorship
as
soon
as
he
slipped
out
of
the
stuffy
house
the
live
air
perfumed
with
freshness
from
meadows
and
hills
afar
made
his
blood
pulse
joyously
he
was
at
the
age
of
hope
and
something
within
him
which
did
not
represent
mere
youthful
illusion
supported
his
courage
in
the
face
of
calculations
such
as
would
have
damped
sober
experience
with
boyish
step
so
light
and
springy
that
it
seemed
anxious
to
run
and
leap
he
took
his
way
through
a
suburb
south
of
thames
and
pushed
on
towards
the
first
rising
of
the
surrey
hills
and
as
he
walked
resolve
strengthened
itself
in
his
heart
somehow
or
other
he
would
live
independently
through
the
next
three
months
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
could
earn
bread
as
clerk
or
labourer
but
as
long
as
his
money
lasted
he
would
pursue
his
purpose
and
that
alone
he
sang
to
himself
in
this
gallant
determination
happy
as
if
some
one
had
left
him
a
fortune
in
an
ascending
road
quiet
and
where
the
dwellings
on
either
side
were
for
the
most
part
old
and
small
though
here
and
there
a
edifice
on
a
larger
scale
showed
that
the
neighbourhood
was
undergoing
change
such
as
in
our
time
destroys
the
picturesque
in
all
london
suburbs
the
cheery
dreamer
chanced
to
turn
his
eyes
upon
a
spot
of
desolation
which
aroused
his
curiosity
and
set
his
fancy
at
work
before
him
stood
three
deserted
houses
a
little
row
once
tenanted
by
folk
but
now
for
some
time
unoccupied
and
unrepaired
they
were
of
brick
but
the
fronts
had
a
stucco
facing
cut
into
imitation
of
ashlar
and
weathered
to
the
sombrest
grey
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
and
of
that
above
and
the
fanlights
above
the
doors
were
boarded
up
a
guard
against
unlicensed
intrusion
the
top
story
had
not
been
thought
to
stand
in
need
of
this
protection
and
a
few
panes
were
broken
on
these
dead
frontages
could
be
traced
the
marks
of
climbing
plants
which
once
hung
their
leaves
about
each
doorway
dry
fragments
of
the
old
stem
still
adhered
to
the
stucco
what
had
been
the
narrow
strip
of
railed
from
the
pavement
was
now
a
little
wilderness
of
coarse
grass
docks
nettles
and
degenerate
shrubs
the
paint
on
the
doors
had
lost
all
colour
and
much
of
it
was
blistered
off
the
three
knockers
had
disappeared
leaving
indications
of
rough
removal
as
if
which
was
probably
the
case
they
had
fallen
a
prey
to
marauders
standing
full
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
this
spectacle
of
abandonment
seemed
sadder
yet
less
ugly
than
it
would
have
looked
under
a
gloomy
sky
goldthorpe
began
to
weave
stories
about
its
musty
squalor
he
crossed
the
road
to
make
a
nearer
inspection
and
as
he
stood
gazing
at
the
dishonoured
thresholds
at
the
stained
and
cracked
boarding
of
the
blind
windows
at
the
rusty
paling
and
the
broken
gates
there
sounded
from
somewhere
near
a
thin
shaky
strain
of
music
the
notes
of
a
concertina
played
with
uncertain
hand
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
within
the
houses
yet
how
could
that
be
assuredly
no
one
lived
under
these
crazy
roofs
the
musician
was
playing
sweet
home
and
as
goldthorpe
listened
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sound
was
not
stationary
indeed
it
moved
it
became
more
distant
then
again
the
notes
sounded
more
distinctly
and
now
as
if
the
player
were
in
the
open
air
perhaps
he
was
at
the
back
of
the
houses
on
either
side
ran
a
narrow
passage
which
parted
the
spot
of
desolation
from
inhabited
dwellings
exploring
one
of
these
goldthorpe
found
that
there
lay
in
the
rear
a
tract
of
gardens
each
of
the
three
lifeless
houses
had
its
garden
of
about
twenty
yards
long
the
bordering
wall
along
the
passage
allowed
a
man
of
average
height
to
peer
over
it
and
goldthorpe
searched
with
curious
eye
the
piece
of
ground
which
was
nearest
to
him
many
a
year
must
have
gone
by
since
any
gardening
was
done
here
once
upon
a
time
the
useful
and
ornamental
had
both
been
represented
in
this
modest
space
now
flowers
and
vegetables
such
of
them
as
survived
in
the
struggle
for
existence
mingled
together
and
all
alike
were
threatened
by
a
wild
rank
growth
of
grasses
and
weeds
which
had
obliterated
the
beds
hidden
the
paths
and
made
of
the
whole
garden
plot
a
green
jungle
but
goldthorpe
gave
only
a
glance
at
this
still
life
his
interest
was
engrossed
by
a
human
figure
seated
on
a
campstool
near
the
back
wall
of
the
house
and
holding
a
concertina
whence
at
this
moment
in
slow
melancholy
strain
sweet
home
began
to
wheeze
forth
the
player
was
a
man
dressed
like
a
decent
clerk
or
shopkeeper
his
head
shaded
with
an
old
straw
hat
rather
too
large
for
him
and
on
his
feet
one
of
which
swung
as
he
sat
with
legs
crossed
a
pair
of
still
more
ancient
slippers
also
too
large
with
head
aside
and
eyes
looking
upward
he
seemed
to
listen
in
a
mild
ecstasy
to
the
notes
of
his
instrument
he
had
a
round
face
of
much
simplicity
and
semicircular
eyebrows
pursed
little
mouth
with
abortive
moustache
and
short
thin
beard
fringing
the
chinless
lower
jaw
having
observed
this
unimposing
person
for
a
minute
or
two
himself
unseen
goldthorpe
surveyed
the
rear
of
the
building
anxious
to
discover
any
sign
of
its
still
serving
as
human
habitation
but
nothing
spoke
of
tenancy
the
windows
on
this
side
were
not
boarded
and
only
a
few
panes
were
broken
but
the
chief
point
of
contrast
with
the
desolate
front
was
made
by
a
virginia
creeper
which
grew
luxuriantly
up
to
the
eaves
hiding
every
sign
of
decay
save
those
dim
dusty
apertures
which
seemed
to
deny
all
possibility
of
life
within
and
yet
on
looking
steadily
did
he
not
discern
something
at
one
of
the
windows
on
the
top
story
something
like
a
curtain
or
a
blind
and
had
not
that
same
window
the
appearance
of
having
been
more
recently
cleaned
than
the
others
he
could
not
be
sure
perhaps
he
only
fancied
these
things
with
neck
aching
from
the
strained
position
in
which
he
had
made
his
survey
over
the
wall
the
young
man
turned
away
in
the
same
moment
sweet
home
came
to
an
end
and
but
for
the
cry
of
a
milkman
the
silence
was
undisturbed
goldthorpe
pursued
his
walk
thinking
of
what
he
had
seen
and
wondering
what
it
all
meant
on
his
way
back
he
made
a
point
of
again
passing
the
deserted
houses
and
again
he
peered
over
the
wall
of
the
passage
the
man
was
still
there
but
no
longer
seated
with
the
concertina
wearing
a
round
felt
hat
instead
of
the
straw
he
stood
almost
in
vegetation
and
appeared
to
be
examining
the
various
growths
about
him
presently
he
moved
forward
and
with
head
still
bent
approached
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
where
in
a
wall
higher
than
that
over
which
goldthorpe
made
his
espial
there
was
a
wooden
door
this
the
man
opened
with
a
key
and
having
passed
out
could
be
heard
to
turn
a
lock
behind
him
a
minute
more
and
this
short
respectable
figure
came
into
sight
at
the
end
of
the
passage
goldthorpe
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
thus
offered
affecting
to
turn
a
look
of
interest
towards
the
nearest
roof
he
waited
until
the
stranger
was
about
to
pass
him
then
with
civil
greeting
ventured
upon
a
question
you
tell
me
how
these
houses
come
to
be
in
this
neglected
state
the
stranger
smiled
a
soft
modest
deferential
smile
such
as
became
his
countenance
and
spoke
in
a
corresponding
voice
which
had
a
vaguely
provincial
accent
wonder
it
surprises
you
sir
i
should
be
surprised
myself
it
comes
of
quarrels
and
lawsuits
i
supposed
do
you
know
who
the
property
belongs
to
yes
sir
the
fact
is
it
belongs
to
me
the
avowal
was
made
apologetically
and
yet
with
a
certain
timid
pride
goldthorpe
exhibited
all
the
interest
he
felt
an
idea
had
suddenly
sprung
up
in
his
mind
he
met
the
stranger
look
and
spoke
with
the
easy
natural
to
him
seems
a
great
pity
that
houses
should
be
standing
empty
like
that
are
they
quite
uninhabitable
could
one
camp
here
during
this
fine
summer
weather
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
looking
for
a
room
as
cheap
a
room
as
i
can
get
could
you
let
me
one
for
the
next
three
months
the
stranger
was
astonished
he
regarded
the
young
man
with
an
uneasy
smile
are
joking
sir
a
bit
of
it
is
the
thing
quite
impossible
are
all
the
rooms
in
too
bad
a
state
wo
say
replied
the
other
cautiously
still
eyeing
his
interlocutor
with
surprised
glances
upper
rooms
are
really
not
so
bad
that
is
to
say
from
a
humble
point
of
view
i
i
have
been
looking
at
them
just
now
you
really
mean
sir
quite
in
earnest
i
assure
you
cried
goldthorpe
cheerily
see
i
tolerably
well
dressed
still
but
i
precious
little
money
and
i
want
to
eke
out
the
little
i
got
for
about
three
months
i
writing
a
book
i
think
i
shall
manage
to
sell
it
when
it
done
but
it
take
me
about
three
months
yet
i
do
care
what
sort
of
place
i
live
in
so
long
as
it
quiet
could
we
come
to
terms
the
listener
visage
seemed
to
grow
rounder
in
progressive
astonishment
his
eyes
declared
an
emotion
akin
to
awe
his
little
mouth
shaped
itself
as
if
about
to
whistle
book
sir
you
are
writing
a
book
you
are
a
literary
man
a
beginner
i
have
poverty
on
my
side
you
see
it
like
dr
johnson
cried
the
other
his
face
glowing
with
interest
like
chatterton
though
i
sure
i
hope
you
wo
end
like
him
sir
it
like
goldsmith
indeed
it
is
got
half
oliver
name
at
all
events
laughed
the
young
man
is
goldthorpe
do
say
so
sir
what
a
strange
coincidence
mine
sir
is
spicer
i
i
do
know
whether
you
care
to
come
into
my
garden
we
might
talk
there
in
a
minute
or
two
they
were
standing
amid
the
green
jungle
which
goldthorpe
viewed
with
delight
he
declared
it
the
most
picturesque
garden
he
had
ever
seen
there
are
potatoes
growing
there
and
what
are
those
things
jerusalem
artichokes
and
look
at
that
magnificent
thistle
i
never
saw
a
finer
thistle
in
my
life
and
poppies
and
marigolds
and
and
is
that
lettuce
spicer
was
red
with
gratification
feel
that
something
might
be
done
with
the
garden
sir
he
said
fact
is
sir
i
only
lately
come
into
this
property
and
i
sorry
to
say
it
only
be
mine
for
a
little
more
than
a
year
a
year
from
next
midsummer
day
sir
there
the
explanation
of
what
you
see
it
leasehold
property
and
the
lease
is
just
coming
to
its
end
five
years
ago
sir
an
uncle
of
mine
inherited
the
property
from
his
brother
the
houses
were
then
in
a
very
bad
state
and
only
one
of
them
let
and
there
had
been
lawsuits
going
on
for
a
long
time
between
the
leaseholder
and
the
i
ca
quite
understand
these
matters
they
not
at
all
in
my
line
sir
but
at
all
events
there
were
quarrels
and
lawsuits
and
i
told
one
of
the
tenants
was
somehow
mixed
up
in
it
the
fact
is
my
uncle
was
a
very
man
and
perhaps
he
did
feel
able
to
repair
the
houses
especially
as
the
lease
was
drawing
to
its
end
would
you
like
to
go
in
and
have
a
look
round
they
entered
by
the
back
door
which
admitted
them
to
a
little
the
window
was
with
cobwebs
thick
hoary
each
corner
of
the
ceiling
was
long
dusty
filaments
depended
along
the
walls
notwithstanding
goldthorpe
noticed
that
the
house
had
a
the
sink
was
wet
the
tap
above
it
looked
new
this
confirmed
a
suspicion
in
his
mind
but
he
made
no
remark
they
passed
into
the
kitchen
here
again
the
work
of
the
spider
showed
thick
on
every
hand
the
window
however
though
uncleaned
for
years
had
recently
been
opened
one
knew
that
by
the
torn
and
ragged
condition
of
the
webs
where
the
sashes
joined
and
lo
on
the
stood
a
plate
a
cup
and
saucer
a
knife
a
fork
a
spoon
all
of
them
manifestly
goldthorpe
affected
not
to
see
these
objects
he
averted
his
face
to
hide
an
involuntary
smile
must
light
a
candle
said
spicer
staircase
is
quite
dark
a
candle
stood
ready
with
a
box
of
matches
on
the
rusty
no
fire
had
burned
in
the
grate
for
many
a
long
day
of
that
the
visitor
assured
himself
save
the
objects
on
the
no
evidence
of
human
occupation
was
discoverable
having
struck
a
light
spicer
advanced
in
the
front
passage
on
the
stairs
on
the
landing
every
angle
and
every
projection
had
its
drapery
of
cobwebs
the
stuffy
musty
air
smelt
of
cobwebs
so
at
all
events
did
goldthorpe
explain
to
himself
a
peculiar
odour
which
he
seemed
never
to
have
smelt
it
was
the
same
in
the
two
rooms
on
the
first
floor
through
the
boarded
windows
of
that
in
front
penetrated
a
few
thin
rays
from
the
golden
sky
they
gleamed
upon
dust
and
web
on
faded
torn
and
a
fireplace
in
ruins
should
recommend
you
to
take
either
of
rooms
said
spicer
looking
nervously
at
his
companion
really
ca
be
called
attractive
on
the
top
are
healthier
no
doubt
was
the
young
man
reply
noticed
that
some
of
the
is
broken
that
must
have
been
good
for
airing
spicer
grew
more
and
more
nervous
he
opened
his
little
round
mouth
very
much
like
a
fish
gasping
but
seemed
unable
to
speak
silently
he
led
the
way
to
the
top
story
still
amid
cobwebs
the
atmosphere
was
certainly
purer
up
here
and
when
they
entered
the
first
room
they
found
themselves
all
at
once
in
such
a
flood
of
glorious
sunshine
that
goldthorpe
shouted
with
delight
i
could
live
here
would
it
cost
much
to
have
panes
put
in
an
old
woman
with
a
broom
would
do
the
rest
he
added
in
a
moment
the
back
windows
are
not
broken
i
think
i
think
not
i
no
spicer
gasped
and
stammered
he
stood
holding
the
candle
its
light
invisible
so
that
the
grease
dripped
steadily
on
his
trousers
have
a
look
at
the
other
cried
goldthorpe
gets
the
afternoon
sun
no
doubt
and
one
would
have
a
view
of
the
garden
sir
broke
from
his
companion
who
was
red
and
perspiring
something
i
should
like
to
tell
you
before
you
go
into
that
room
i
it
the
fact
is
sir
that
temporarily
i
am
occupying
it
myself
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
spicer
at
all
sir
do
mention
it
sir
i
have
a
reason
it
seemed
to
me
i
merely
put
in
a
bed
and
a
table
sir
that
all
a
temporary
arrangement
yes
i
quite
understand
what
could
be
more
sensible
if
the
house
were
mine
i
should
do
the
same
what
the
good
of
owning
a
house
and
making
no
use
of
it
great
was
spicer
satisfaction
what
it
is
sir
he
exclaimed
have
to
do
with
a
literary
man
you
are
sir
you
see
things
from
an
intellectual
point
of
view
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
gratifies
me
sir
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
let
us
go
into
the
back
room
with
nervous
boldness
he
threw
the
door
open
goldthorpe
advancing
respectfully
saw
that
spicer
had
not
exaggerated
the
simplicity
of
his
arrangements
in
a
certain
measure
the
room
had
been
cleaned
but
along
the
angle
of
walls
and
ceiling
there
still
clung
a
good
many
cobwebs
and
the
state
of
the
paper
was
deplorable
a
blind
hung
at
the
window
but
the
floor
had
no
carpet
in
one
corner
stood
a
little
camp
bed
neatly
made
for
the
day
a
table
and
a
chair
of
the
cheapest
species
occupied
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
on
the
hearth
was
an
oil
wonderful
how
little
one
really
wants
remarked
spicer
all
events
in
weather
such
as
this
i
find
that
i
get
along
here
very
well
indeed
the
only
expense
i
had
was
for
the
and
really
sir
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
the
situation
is
pleasant
if
one
mind
loneliness
and
it
happens
that
i
do
i
have
my
books
sir
he
opened
the
door
of
a
cupboard
containing
several
shelves
the
first
thing
goldthorpe
eye
fell
upon
was
the
concertina
he
saw
also
sundry
articles
of
clothing
neatly
disposed
a
little
crockery
and
ranged
on
the
two
top
shelves
some
thirty
volumes
all
of
venerable
aspect
sir
pursued
spicer
modestly
always
been
my
comfort
i
have
had
very
much
time
for
reading
but
my
motto
sir
has
been
dies
sine
it
appeared
from
his
pronunciation
that
spicer
was
no
classical
scholar
but
he
uttered
the
latin
words
with
infinite
gusto
and
timidly
watched
their
effect
upon
the
listener
is
delightful
cried
goldthorpe
you
let
me
have
the
front
room
i
could
work
here
splendidly
splendidly
what
rent
do
you
ask
mr
spicer
really
sir
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
know
what
to
say
of
course
the
windows
must
be
seen
to
the
fact
is
sir
if
you
felt
disposed
to
do
that
at
your
own
expense
and
and
to
have
the
room
cleaned
and
and
let
us
say
to
bear
half
the
whilst
you
are
here
why
really
i
hardly
feel
justified
in
asking
anything
more
it
was
goldthorpe
turn
to
be
embarrassed
for
little
as
he
was
prepared
to
pay
he
did
not
like
to
accept
a
stranger
generosity
they
discussed
the
matter
in
detail
with
the
result
that
for
the
arrangement
which
spicer
had
proposed
there
was
substituted
a
weekly
rent
of
two
shillings
the
lease
extending
over
a
period
of
three
months
goldthorpe
was
to
live
quite
independently
asking
nothing
in
the
way
of
domestic
service
moreover
he
was
requested
to
introduce
no
other
person
to
the
house
even
as
casual
visitor
these
conditions
spicer
set
forth
in
a
commercial
hand
on
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
the
agreement
was
solemnly
signed
by
both
contracting
parties
on
the
way
home
to
breakfast
goldthorpe
reviewed
his
position
now
that
he
had
taken
this
decisive
step
it
was
plain
that
he
must
furnish
his
room
with
the
articles
which
spicer
found
indispensable
and
this
outlay
be
as
economical
as
he
might
would
tell
upon
the
little
capital
which
was
to
support
him
for
three
months
indeed
when
all
had
been
done
and
he
found
himself
four
days
later
dwelling
on
the
top
story
of
the
house
of
cobwebs
a
simple
computation
informed
him
that
his
total
expenditure
after
payment
of
rent
must
not
exceed
fifteenpence
a
day
what
matter
he
was
in
the
highest
spirits
full
of
energy
and
hope
his
landlord
had
been
kind
and
helpful
in
all
sorts
of
ways
helping
him
to
clean
the
room
to
remove
his
property
from
the
old
lodgings
to
make
purchases
at
the
lowest
possible
rate
to
establish
himself
as
comfortably
as
circumstances
permitted
and
when
on
the
first
morning
of
his
tenancy
he
was
awakened
by
a
brilliant
sun
the
young
man
had
a
sensation
of
comfort
and
satisfaction
quite
new
in
his
experience
for
he
was
really
at
home
the
bed
he
slept
on
the
table
he
ate
at
and
wrote
upon
were
his
own
possessions
he
thought
with
pity
of
his
life
and
felt
a
joyous
assurance
that
here
he
would
do
better
work
than
ever
before
in
less
than
a
week
spicer
and
he
were
so
friendly
that
they
began
to
eat
together
taking
it
in
turns
to
prepare
the
meal
now
and
then
they
walked
in
company
and
every
evening
they
sat
smoking
very
cheap
tobacco
in
the
wild
garden
little
by
little
spicer
revealed
the
facts
of
his
history
he
had
begun
life
in
a
midland
town
as
a
chemist
and
by
steady
perseverance
with
a
little
pecuniary
help
from
relatives
had
at
length
risen
to
the
position
of
chemist
assistant
for
years
he
practised
such
rigid
economy
that
having
no
one
but
himself
to
provide
for
he
began
to
foresee
a
possibility
of
passing
his
old
age
elsewhere
than
in
the
workhouse
then
befell
the
death
of
his
uncle
which
was
to
have
important
consequences
for
him
spicer
told
the
story
of
this
exciting
moment
late
one
evening
when
kept
indoors
by
rain
the
companions
sat
together
upstairs
one
on
each
side
of
the
rusty
and
empty
fireplace
my
life
goldthorpe
i
thought
what
a
delightful
thing
it
must
be
to
have
a
house
of
one
own
i
mean
really
of
one
own
not
only
a
rented
house
but
one
in
which
you
could
live
and
die
feeling
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
turn
you
out
often
and
often
i
dreamt
of
it
and
tried
to
imagine
what
the
feeling
would
be
like
not
a
large
fine
house
oh
dear
no
i
did
care
how
small
it
might
be
indeed
the
smaller
the
better
for
a
man
of
my
sort
well
then
you
can
imagine
how
it
came
upon
me
when
i
heard
but
let
me
tell
you
first
that
i
had
seen
my
uncle
for
fifteen
years
or
more
i
had
always
thought
him
a
man
and
i
knew
he
was
married
but
the
truth
is
it
never
came
into
my
head
that
he
might
leave
me
something
picture
me
goldthorpe
you
have
imagination
sir
standing
behind
the
counter
and
thinking
about
nothing
but
business
when
in
comes
a
young
gentleman
i
see
him
now
and
asks
for
spicer
spicer
is
my
name
sir
i
said
and
you
are
the
nephew
were
his
next
words
of
the
late
isaac
spicer
of
clapham
london
that
shook
me
sir
i
assure
you
it
did
but
i
hope
i
behaved
decently
the
young
gentleman
went
on
to
tell
me
that
my
uncle
had
left
no
will
and
that
i
was
believed
to
be
his
and
that
if
so
i
inherited
all
his
property
the
principal
part
of
which
was
three
houses
in
london
now
try
and
think
goldthorpe
what
sort
of
state
i
was
in
after
hearing
that
you
an
intellectual
man
and
you
can
enter
into
another
mind
three
houses
well
sir
you
know
what
houses
those
were
i
came
up
to
london
at
once
it
was
last
autumn
and
i
saw
my
uncle
lawyer
and
he
told
me
all
about
the
property
and
i
saw
it
for
myself
ah
goldthorpe
if
ever
a
man
suffered
a
bitter
disappointment
sir
he
ended
on
a
little
laugh
as
if
excusing
himself
for
making
so
much
of
his
story
and
sat
for
a
moment
with
head
bowed
played
you
a
nasty
trick
there
said
goldthorpe
knavish
trick
felt
almost
justified
in
using
strong
language
sir
though
i
always
avoid
it
on
principle
however
i
must
tell
you
that
the
houses
all
luckily
there
was
a
little
money
as
well
and
putting
it
with
my
own
savings
sir
i
found
it
would
yield
me
an
income
when
i
say
an
income
i
mean
of
course
for
a
man
in
my
position
even
when
i
have
to
go
into
lodgings
when
my
houses
become
the
property
of
the
to
my
mind
goldthorpe
a
very
great
injustice
but
i
do
set
myself
up
against
the
law
of
the
land
i
shall
just
be
able
to
live
and
that
no
small
blessing
sir
as
i
think
you
agree
it
the
height
of
human
felicity
spicer
i
envy
you
vastly
sir
i
rather
disposed
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
myself
my
nature
is
not
discontented
goldthorpe
but
sir
if
you
could
have
seen
me
when
the
lawyer
began
to
explain
about
the
houses
i
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
leasehold
system
and
at
first
i
really
understand
the
lawyer
thought
me
a
fool
i
fear
sir
and
when
i
came
down
here
and
saw
the
houses
themselves
i
afraid
goldthorpe
i
really
afraid
sir
i
was
weak
enough
to
shed
a
tear
they
were
sitting
by
the
light
of
a
very
small
lamp
which
did
not
tend
to
cheerfulness
cried
goldthorpe
all
the
houses
are
yours
for
a
twelvemonth
why
should
we
both
live
on
here
all
the
time
it
be
a
little
breezy
in
winter
but
we
could
have
the
fireplaces
knocked
into
shape
and
keep
up
good
fires
when
i
sold
my
book
i
pay
a
higher
rent
spicer
i
like
the
old
house
upon
my
word
i
do
come
let
us
have
a
tune
before
we
go
to
bed
smiling
and
happy
spicer
fetched
from
the
cupboard
his
concertina
and
after
the
usual
apology
for
what
he
called
his
mastery
of
the
instrument
sat
down
to
play
sweet
home
he
had
played
it
for
years
and
evidently
would
never
improve
in
his
execution
after
sweet
home
came
bluebells
of
scotland
after
that
laurie
and
spicer
repertory
was
at
an
end
he
talked
of
learning
new
pieces
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
hope
of
this
achievement
spicer
mental
development
had
ceased
more
than
twenty
years
ago
when
after
extreme
efforts
he
had
attained
the
qualification
of
assistant
since
then
the
world
had
stood
still
with
him
though
a
true
lover
of
books
he
knew
nothing
of
any
that
had
been
published
during
his
own
lifetime
his
father
though
very
poor
had
possessed
a
little
collection
of
volumes
the
very
same
which
now
stood
in
cupboard
the
authors
represented
in
this
library
were
either
english
classics
or
obscure
writers
of
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
knowing
these
books
very
thoroughly
spicer
sometimes
indulged
in
a
quotation
which
would
have
puzzled
even
the
erudite
his
favourite
poet
was
cowper
whose
moral
sentiments
greatly
soothed
him
he
spoke
of
byron
like
some
contemporary
who
whilst
admitting
his
lordship
genius
felt
an
abhorrence
of
his
life
he
judged
literature
solely
from
the
moral
point
of
view
and
was
incapable
of
understanding
any
other
of
fiction
he
had
read
very
little
indeed
for
it
was
not
regarded
with
favour
by
his
parents
scott
was
hardly
more
than
a
name
to
him
and
though
he
avowed
acquaintance
with
one
or
two
works
of
dickens
he
spoke
of
them
with
an
uneasy
smile
as
if
in
some
doubt
as
to
their
tendency
with
these
intellectual
characteristics
spicer
naturally
found
it
difficult
to
appreciate
the
attitude
of
his
literary
friend
a
young
man
whose
brain
thrilled
in
response
to
modern
ideas
and
who
regarded
himself
as
the
destined
leader
of
a
new
school
of
fiction
not
indiscreet
goldthorpe
soon
became
aware
that
he
had
better
talk
as
little
as
possible
of
the
work
which
absorbed
his
energies
he
had
enough
liberality
and
sense
of
humour
to
understand
and
enjoy
his
landlord
conversation
and
the
simple
goodness
of
the
man
inspired
him
with
no
little
respect
thus
they
got
along
together
remarkably
well
spicer
never
ceased
to
feel
himself
honoured
by
the
presence
under
his
roof
of
one
who
as
he
was
wont
to
say
wielded
the
pen
the
tradition
of
grub
street
was
for
him
a
living
fact
he
thought
of
all
authors
as
struggling
with
poverty
and
continued
to
cite
examples
by
way
of
encouraging
goldthorpe
and
animating
his
zeal
whilst
the
young
man
was
at
work
spicer
moved
about
the
house
with
soundless
footsteps
when
invited
into
his
tenant
room
he
had
a
reverential
demeanour
and
the
sight
of
manuscript
on
the
bare
deal
table
caused
him
to
subdue
his
voice
the
weeks
went
by
and
goldthorpe
novel
steadily
progressed
in
london
he
had
only
two
or
three
acquaintances
and
from
them
he
held
aloof
lest
necessity
or
temptation
should
lead
to
his
spending
money
which
he
could
not
spare
the
few
letters
which
he
received
were
addressed
to
a
impossible
to
shock
the
nerves
of
a
postman
by
requesting
him
to
deliver
correspondence
at
this
dead
house
of
which
the
front
door
had
not
been
opened
for
years
the
weather
was
perfect
a
great
deal
of
sunshine
but
as
yet
no
oppressive
heat
even
in
the
chambers
under
the
roof
towards
the
end
of
june
spicer
began
to
amuse
himself
with
a
little
gardening
he
had
discovered
in
the
an
ancient
fork
with
one
prong
broken
and
the
others
rusting
away
this
implement
served
him
in
his
slow
meditative
attack
on
that
part
of
the
jungle
which
seemed
to
offer
least
resistance
he
would
work
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
resting
on
his
fork
contemplate
the
tangled
mass
of
vegetation
which
he
had
succeeded
in
tearing
up
aim
should
be
he
said
gravely
when
goldthorpe
came
to
observe
his
progress
clear
the
soil
round
about
those
vegetables
and
flowers
which
seem
worth
preserving
these
for
instance
they
seem
to
be
a
very
fine
sort
and
the
jerusalem
artichokes
i
been
making
inquiry
about
the
artichokes
and
i
told
they
are
not
ready
to
eat
till
the
autumn
the
first
frost
is
said
to
improve
them
they
fine
plants
very
fine
plants
already
the
garden
had
supplied
them
with
occasional
food
but
they
had
to
confess
that
for
the
most
part
these
wild
vegetables
lacked
savour
the
artichokes
now
shooting
up
into
a
leafy
grove
were
the
great
hope
of
the
future
it
would
be
deplorable
to
quit
the
house
before
this
tuber
came
to
maturity
worst
of
it
is
remarked
spicer
one
day
when
he
was
perspiring
freely
i
ca
help
thinking
of
how
different
it
would
be
if
this
garden
was
really
my
own
the
fact
is
goldthorpe
i
ca
put
much
heart
into
the
work
no
i
ca
the
more
i
reflect
the
more
indignant
i
become
really
now
goldthorpe
speaking
as
an
intellectual
man
as
a
man
of
imagination
could
anything
be
more
cruelly
unjust
than
this
leasehold
system
i
assure
you
it
keeps
me
awake
at
night
it
really
does
the
tenor
of
his
conversation
proved
that
spicer
had
no
intention
of
leaving
the
house
until
he
was
legally
obliged
to
do
so
more
than
once
he
had
an
interview
with
his
late
uncle
solicitor
and
each
time
he
came
back
with
melancholy
brow
all
the
details
of
the
story
were
now
familiar
to
him
he
knew
all
about
the
lawsuits
which
had
ruined
the
property
whenever
he
spoke
of
the
known
to
him
only
by
name
it
was
with
a
severity
such
as
he
never
permitted
himself
on
any
other
subject
the
was
to
his
mind
an
embodiment
of
social
injustice
in
my
life
goldthorpe
did
i
grudge
any
payment
of
money
as
i
grudge
the
of
these
houses
i
feel
it
as
robbery
sir
as
sheer
robbery
though
the
sum
is
so
small
when
in
my
ignorance
the
matter
was
first
explained
to
me
i
wondered
why
my
uncle
had
continued
to
pay
this
rent
the
houses
being
of
no
profit
to
him
but
now
i
understand
goldthorpe
the
sense
of
possession
is
very
sweet
property
property
even
when
it
leasehold
and
in
ruins
i
grudge
the
bitterly
but
i
feel
sir
that
i
could
bear
to
lose
my
houses
until
the
fatal
moment
when
lose
them
i
must
in
august
the
thermometer
began
to
mark
high
degrees
goldthorpe
found
it
necessary
to
dispense
with
coat
and
waistcoat
when
he
was
working
and
at
times
a
treacherous
languor
whispered
to
him
of
the
delights
of
idleness
after
one
particularly
hot
day
he
and
his
landlord
smoked
together
in
the
dusking
garden
both
unusually
silent
spicer
eye
dwelt
upon
the
great
heap
of
weeds
which
was
resulting
from
his
labour
an
odour
somewhat
too
poignant
arose
from
it
upon
the
close
air
goldthorpe
who
had
been
rather
headachy
all
day
was
trying
to
think
into
perfect
clearness
the
last
chapters
of
his
book
and
found
it
difficult
know
he
said
all
at
once
with
an
impatient
movement
ought
to
be
at
the
seaside
seaside
echoed
his
companion
in
surprise
it
a
long
time
since
i
saw
the
sea
goldthorpe
why
it
must
be
yes
it
is
at
least
twenty
years
i
been
there
every
year
of
my
life
till
this
one
gets
into
the
way
of
thinking
of
luxuries
as
necessities
i
tell
you
what
it
is
if
i
sell
my
book
as
soon
as
it
done
we
have
a
few
days
somewhere
on
the
south
coast
together
spicer
betrayed
uneasiness
should
like
it
much
he
murmured
i
fear
goldthorpe
i
greatly
fear
i
ca
afford
it
but
i
mean
that
you
shall
go
with
me
as
my
guest
but
for
you
spicer
i
might
never
have
got
my
book
written
at
all
feel
it
an
honour
sir
i
assure
you
to
have
a
literary
man
in
my
house
was
the
genial
reply
you
think
the
will
soon
be
finished
sir
spicer
always
spoke
of
his
tenant
novel
as
work
which
on
his
lips
had
a
very
large
and
respectful
sound
a
fortnight
more
answered
goldthorpe
with
grave
intensity
the
heat
continued
as
he
lay
awake
before
getting
up
eager
to
finish
his
book
yet
dreading
the
torrid
temperature
of
his
room
which
made
the
brain
sluggish
and
the
hand
slow
goldthorpe
saw
how
two
or
three
energetic
spiders
had
begun
to
spin
webs
once
more
at
the
corners
of
the
ceiling
now
and
then
he
heard
the
long
buzzing
of
a
fly
entangled
in
one
of
these
webs
the
same
thing
was
happening
in
spicer
chamber
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
to
brush
the
new
webs
away
you
come
to
think
of
it
sir
said
the
landlord
the
spiders
who
are
the
real
owners
of
these
houses
when
i
go
away
they
be
pulled
down
they
not
fit
for
human
habitation
only
the
spiders
are
really
at
home
here
and
the
fact
is
sir
i
do
feel
i
have
the
right
to
disturb
them
as
a
man
of
imagination
goldthorpe
you
understand
my
thoughts
only
with
a
great
effort
was
the
novel
finished
goldthorpe
had
lost
his
appetite
not
perhaps
altogether
a
disadvantage
and
he
could
not
sleep
a
slight
fever
seemed
to
be
constantly
upon
him
but
this
work
was
a
question
of
life
and
death
to
him
and
he
brought
it
to
an
end
only
a
few
days
after
the
term
he
had
set
himself
the
complete
manuscript
was
exhibited
to
spicer
who
expressed
his
profound
sense
of
the
privilege
then
without
delay
goldthorpe
took
it
to
the
publishing
house
in
which
he
had
most
hope
the
young
author
could
now
do
nothing
but
wait
and
under
the
circumstances
waiting
meant
torture
his
money
was
all
but
exhausted
if
he
could
not
speedily
sell
the
book
his
position
would
be
that
of
a
mere
pauper
supported
thus
long
by
the
artist
enthusiasm
he
fell
into
despondency
saw
the
dark
side
of
things
to
be
sure
his
mother
a
widow
in
narrow
circumstances
had
written
pressing
him
to
take
a
holiday
home
but
he
dreaded
the
thought
of
going
penniless
to
his
mother
house
and
there
perchance
receiving
bad
news
about
his
book
an
ugly
feature
of
the
situation
was
that
he
continued
to
feel
anything
but
well
indeed
he
felt
sure
that
he
was
getting
worse
at
night
he
suffered
severely
sleep
had
almost
forsaken
him
hour
after
hour
he
lay
listening
to
mysterious
noises
strange
crackings
and
creakings
through
the
desolate
house
sometimes
he
imagined
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
bare
rooms
below
even
hushed
voices
from
he
knew
not
where
chilled
his
blood
at
midnight
since
crumbs
had
begun
to
lie
about
mice
were
common
they
scampered
as
if
in
revelry
above
the
ceiling
and
under
the
floor
and
within
the
walls
goldthorpe
began
to
dislike
this
strange
abode
he
felt
that
under
any
circumstances
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
dwell
here
much
longer
when
his
last
coin
was
spent
and
he
had
no
choice
but
to
pawn
or
sell
something
for
a
few
days
subsistence
the
manuscript
came
back
upon
his
hands
it
had
been
judged
declined
that
morning
he
felt
seriously
unwell
after
making
known
the
catastrophe
to
spicer
who
was
stricken
voiceless
he
stood
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
then
said
with
quiet
resolve
all
up
i
no
money
and
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
have
an
illness
i
must
say
to
you
old
friend
goldthorpe
exclaimed
the
other
solemnly
entreat
you
sir
to
do
nothing
rash
take
heart
sir
think
of
samuel
johnson
think
of
goldsmith
extent
of
my
rashness
spicer
will
be
to
raise
enough
money
on
my
watch
to
get
down
into
derbyshire
i
must
go
home
if
i
do
you
have
the
pleasant
job
of
taking
me
to
a
hospital
spicer
insisted
on
lending
him
the
small
sum
he
needed
an
hour
or
two
later
they
were
at
pancras
station
and
before
sunset
goldthorpe
had
found
harbourage
under
his
mother
roof
there
he
lay
ill
for
more
than
a
month
and
convalescent
for
as
long
again
his
doctor
declared
that
he
must
have
been
living
in
some
very
unhealthy
place
but
the
young
man
preferred
to
explain
his
illness
by
overwork
it
seemed
to
him
sheer
ingratitude
to
throw
blame
on
spicer
house
where
he
had
been
so
contented
and
worked
so
well
until
the
hot
days
of
latter
august
spicer
himself
wrote
kind
and
odd
little
letters
giving
an
account
of
the
garden
and
earnestly
hoping
that
his
literary
friend
would
be
back
in
london
to
taste
the
jerusalem
artichokes
but
christmas
came
and
went
and
goldthorpe
was
still
at
his
mother
house
meanwhile
the
manuscript
had
gone
from
publisher
to
publisher
and
at
length
on
a
day
in
january
date
ever
memorable
in
life
there
arrived
a
short
letter
in
which
a
certain
firm
dryly
intimated
their
approval
of
the
story
offered
them
and
their
willingness
to
purchase
the
copyright
for
a
sum
of
fifty
pounds
the
next
morning
the
triumphant
author
travelled
to
london
for
two
or
three
days
a
violent
gale
had
been
blowing
with
much
damage
throughout
the
country
on
his
journey
goldthorpe
saw
many
great
trees
lying
prostrate
beaten
as
though
scornfully
by
the
cold
rain
which
now
descended
in
torrents
arrived
in
town
he
went
to
the
house
where
he
had
lodged
in
the
time
of
comparative
prosperity
and
there
was
lucky
enough
to
find
his
old
rooms
vacant
on
the
morrow
he
called
upon
the
gracious
publishers
and
after
that
under
a
sky
now
become
more
gentle
he
took
his
way
towards
the
abode
of
spicer
eager
to
communicate
the
joyous
news
glad
in
the
prospect
of
seeing
his
friend
he
went
at
a
great
pace
up
the
ascending
road
there
were
the
three
houses
looking
drearier
than
ever
in
a
faint
gleam
of
winter
sunshine
there
were
his
old
windows
but
what
had
happened
to
the
roof
he
stood
in
astonishment
and
apprehension
for
just
above
the
room
where
he
had
dwelt
the
roof
was
an
utter
wreck
showing
a
great
hole
as
if
something
had
fallen
upon
it
with
crushing
weight
as
indeed
was
the
case
evidently
the
had
come
down
and
doubtless
in
the
recent
gale
seized
with
anxiety
on
spicer
account
he
ran
round
to
the
back
of
the
garden
and
tried
the
door
but
it
was
locked
as
usual
he
strained
to
peer
over
the
garden
wall
but
could
discover
nothing
that
threw
light
on
his
friend
fate
he
noticed
however
a
great
grove
of
dead
brown
artichoke
stems
seven
or
eight
feet
high
looking
up
at
the
back
windows
he
shouted
spicer
name
it
was
useless
then
in
serious
alarm
he
betook
himself
to
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
of
the
woman
who
presented
herself
whether
anything
was
known
of
a
gentleman
who
dwelt
where
the
had
just
fallen
news
was
at
once
forthcoming
the
event
had
obviously
caused
no
small
local
excitement
it
was
two
days
since
the
falling
of
the
chimney
which
happened
towards
evening
when
the
gale
blew
its
hardest
spicer
was
at
that
moment
sitting
before
the
fire
and
only
by
a
miracle
had
he
escaped
destruction
for
an
immense
weight
of
material
came
down
through
the
rotten
roof
and
even
broke
a
good
deal
of
the
flooring
had
the
occupant
been
anywhere
but
close
by
the
fireplace
he
must
have
been
crushed
to
a
mummy
as
it
was
only
a
few
bricks
struck
him
inflicting
severe
bruises
on
back
and
arms
but
the
shock
had
been
serious
when
his
shouts
from
the
window
at
length
attracted
attention
and
brought
help
the
poor
man
had
to
be
carried
downstairs
and
in
a
thoroughly
helpless
state
was
removed
to
the
nearest
hospital
room
was
he
in
inquired
goldthorpe
or
front
the
front
room
the
back
was
touched
musing
on
spicer
bad
luck
for
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
changed
from
the
back
to
the
front
room
just
in
order
that
the
chimney
might
fall
on
him
goldthorpe
hastened
away
to
the
hospital
he
could
not
be
admitted
but
heard
that
his
friend
was
doing
very
well
on
the
morrow
he
would
be
allowed
to
see
him
so
at
the
visitors
hour
goldthorpe
returned
entering
the
long
accident
ward
he
searched
anxiously
for
the
familiar
face
and
caught
sight
of
it
just
as
it
began
to
beam
recognition
spicer
was
sitting
up
in
bed
he
looked
pale
and
meagre
but
not
seriously
ill
his
voice
quivered
with
delight
as
he
greeted
the
young
man
heard
of
your
inquiring
for
me
yesterday
goldthorpe
and
hardly
been
able
to
live
for
impatience
to
see
you
how
are
you
sir
how
are
you
and
what
news
about
the
sir
talk
about
that
presently
spicer
tell
me
all
about
your
accident
how
came
you
to
be
in
the
front
room
sir
replied
the
patient
with
a
little
shake
of
the
head
indeed
was
singular
only
a
few
days
before
i
had
made
a
removal
from
my
room
into
yours
i
call
it
yours
sir
for
i
always
thought
of
it
as
yours
but
thank
heaven
you
were
not
there
only
a
few
days
before
i
took
that
step
goldthorpe
for
two
reasons
first
because
water
was
coming
through
the
roof
at
the
back
in
rather
unpleasant
quantities
and
secondly
because
i
hoped
to
get
a
little
morning
sun
in
the
front
the
fact
is
sir
my
room
had
been
just
a
little
depressing
ah
goldthorpe
if
you
knew
how
i
have
missed
you
sir
but
the
what
news
of
the
smiling
as
though
carelessly
the
author
made
known
his
good
fortune
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spicer
could
talk
of
nothing
else
has
completed
my
cure
he
kept
repeating
work
was
composed
under
my
roof
my
own
roof
sir
did
i
not
tell
you
to
take
heart
where
are
you
going
to
live
asked
goldthorpe
presently
go
back
to
the
old
house
no
sir
all
my
life
i
have
dreamt
of
the
joy
of
owning
a
house
you
know
how
the
dream
was
realised
goldthorpe
and
you
see
what
has
come
of
it
at
last
probably
it
is
a
chastisement
for
overweening
desires
sir
i
should
have
remembered
my
position
and
kept
my
wishes
within
bounds
but
goldthorpe
i
shall
continue
to
cultivate
the
garden
sir
i
shall
put
in
spring
lettuces
and
radishes
and
mustard
and
cress
the
property
is
mine
till
midsummer
day
you
shall
eat
a
lettuce
of
my
growing
goldthorpe
i
am
bent
on
that
and
how
i
grieve
that
you
were
not
with
me
at
the
time
of
the
artichokes
just
at
the
moment
when
they
were
touched
by
the
first
frost
they
were
really
good
mr
spicer
they
seemed
good
to
very
good
just
at
the
moment
of
the
first
frost
a
capitalist
among
the
men
whom
i
saw
occasionally
at
the
little
club
in
mortimer
street
and
nowhere
else
was
one
who
drew
my
attention
before
i
had
learnt
his
name
or
knew
anything
about
him
of
middle
age
in
the
fullness
of
health
and
vigour
but
slenderly
built
his
face
rather
shrewd
than
intellectual
interesting
rather
than
pleasing
always
dressed
as
the
season
mode
dictated
but
without
dandyism
assuredly
he
belonged
to
the
and
probably
to
the
world
at
first
sight
of
him
i
remember
resenting
his
perfection
it
struck
me
as
bad
form
here
in
mortimer
street
among
fellows
of
the
pen
and
the
palette
said
harvey
munden
afraid
of
being
taken
for
one
of
us
he
buys
pictures
not
a
bad
sort
i
believe
if
it
were
for
his
snobbishness
name
has
a
house
in
fitzjohn
avenue
and
a
wife
six
months
later
i
recalled
this
description
of
ireton
she
was
the
talk
of
the
town
the
heroine
of
the
newest
divorce
case
by
that
time
i
had
got
to
know
her
husband
perhaps
once
a
fortnight
we
chatted
at
the
club
and
i
found
him
an
agreeable
acquaintance
before
the
divorce
court
flashed
a
light
of
scandal
upon
his
home
i
felt
that
there
was
more
in
him
than
could
be
discovered
in
casual
gossip
i
wished
to
know
him
better
something
of
shyness
marked
his
manner
and
like
all
shy
men
he
sometimes
appeared
arrogant
he
had
a
habit
of
twisting
his
moustache
nervously
and
of
throwing
quick
glances
in
every
direction
as
he
talked
if
he
found
some
one
eye
upon
him
he
pulled
himself
together
and
sat
for
a
moment
as
if
before
a
photographer
one
easily
perceived
that
he
was
not
a
man
of
liberal
education
he
had
rather
too
much
of
the
accent
his
pronunciation
of
foreign
names
told
a
tale
but
i
thought
him
and
when
the
began
to
busy
themselves
with
his
affairs
i
felt
sorry
for
him
nothing
to
his
dishonour
came
out
in
the
trial
he
and
his
interesting
spouse
had
evidently
lived
a
life
throughout
the
three
years
of
their
marriage
but
the
countercharges
brought
against
him
broke
down
completely
it
was
abundantly
proved
that
he
had
kept
a
harem
somewhere
near
leicester
square
that
he
had
thrown
a
decanter
at
ireton
she
on
the
other
hand
left
the
court
with
tattered
reputation
ireton
got
his
release
and
the
weekly
papers
applauded
but
in
mortimer
street
we
saw
him
no
more
some
one
said
that
he
had
gone
to
live
in
paris
some
one
else
reported
that
he
had
purchased
an
estate
in
bucks
presently
he
was
forgotten
some
three
years
went
by
and
i
was
spending
the
autumn
at
a
village
by
the
new
forest
one
day
i
came
upon
a
man
kneeling
under
a
hedge
examining
some
object
on
the
ground
fern
or
flower
or
perhaps
insect
his
costume
showed
that
he
was
no
native
of
the
locality
i
took
him
for
a
stray
townsman
probably
a
naturalist
he
wore
a
straw
hat
and
a
rough
summer
suit
a
wallet
hung
from
his
shoulder
the
sound
of
my
steps
on
crackling
wood
caused
him
to
turn
and
look
at
me
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
recognised
ireton
and
he
knew
me
he
smiled
as
i
had
often
seen
him
smile
with
a
sort
of
embarrassment
we
greeted
each
other
here
he
said
at
once
when
the
handshaking
was
over
you
tell
me
what
this
little
flower
is
i
stooped
but
was
unable
to
give
him
the
information
he
desired
do
go
in
for
that
kind
of
thing
no
having
a
turn
at
it
i
want
to
know
the
flowers
and
ferns
i
have
a
book
at
my
lodgings
and
i
look
the
things
up
when
i
get
home
his
wallet
contained
a
number
of
specimens
he
plucked
up
the
little
plant
by
the
root
and
stowed
it
away
i
watched
him
with
curiosity
perhaps
i
had
seen
only
his
public
side
perhaps
even
then
he
was
capable
of
dressing
roughly
and
of
rambling
for
his
pleasure
among
fields
and
wood
but
such
a
possibility
had
never
occurred
to
me
i
wondered
whether
his
brilliant
wife
had
given
him
a
disgust
for
the
ways
of
town
if
so
he
was
a
more
interesting
man
than
i
had
supposed
are
you
staying
he
asked
after
a
glance
this
way
and
that
i
named
the
village
two
miles
away
merely
in
a
few
minutes
he
overcame
his
reserve
and
began
to
talk
of
the
things
which
he
knew
interested
me
we
discussed
the
books
of
the
past
season
the
exhibitions
the
new
men
in
letters
and
art
ireton
said
that
he
had
been
living
at
a
wayside
inn
for
about
a
week
he
thought
of
moving
on
and
as
i
had
nothing
to
do
suppose
he
came
over
for
a
few
days
to
the
village
where
i
was
camped
i
welcomed
the
proposal
an
inn
i
dare
say
i
like
the
little
inns
in
this
part
of
the
country
dirty
of
course
and
the
cooking
hideous
but
it
pleasant
for
a
change
i
like
to
be
awoke
by
the
cock
crowing
and
to
see
the
grubby
little
window
when
i
open
my
eyes
i
began
to
suspect
that
he
had
come
down
in
the
world
could
his
prosperity
have
been
due
to
treton
had
she
carried
off
the
money
he
might
affect
a
liking
for
simple
things
when
grandeur
was
no
longer
in
his
reach
yet
i
remembered
that
he
had
undoubtedly
been
botanising
before
he
knew
of
my
approach
and
such
a
form
of
pastime
seemed
to
prove
him
sincere
by
chance
i
witnessed
his
arrival
the
next
morning
he
drove
up
in
a
farmer
trap
his
luggage
a
couple
of
large
that
day
and
the
next
we
spent
many
hours
together
his
vanity
though
not
outgrown
was
in
abeyance
he
talked
with
easy
frankness
yet
never
of
what
i
much
desired
to
know
his
own
history
and
present
position
it
was
his
intellect
that
he
revealed
to
me
i
gathered
that
he
had
given
much
time
to
study
during
the
past
three
years
and
incidentally
it
came
out
that
he
had
been
living
abroad
his
improved
pronunciation
of
the
names
of
french
artists
was
very
noticeable
at
his
age
not
less
than
this
advance
argued
no
common
mental
resources
whether
he
had
suffered
much
i
could
not
determine
at
present
he
seemed
enough
certainly
there
was
no
affectation
in
his
pursuit
of
botany
again
and
again
i
saw
him
glow
with
genuine
delight
when
he
had
identified
a
plant
after
all
this
might
be
in
keeping
with
his
character
for
even
in
the
old
days
he
had
never
exhibited
at
all
events
to
me
a
taste
for
the
ignobler
luxuries
and
he
had
seemed
to
me
a
very
man
i
never
knew
any
one
who
refrained
so
absolutely
from
allusion
good
or
bad
to
his
friends
or
acquaintances
he
might
have
stood
utterly
alone
in
the
world
a
simple
spectator
of
civilisation
at
length
i
ventured
upon
a
question
never
see
any
of
the
mortimer
street
men
he
answered
carelessly
have
come
in
their
way
lately
somehow
that
evening
our
ramble
led
us
into
an
enclosure
where
game
was
preserved
we
had
lost
our
way
and
ireton
scornful
of
objections
struck
across
country
making
for
a
small
plantation
which
he
thought
he
remembered
here
among
the
trees
we
were
suddenly
face
to
face
with
an
old
gentleman
of
distinguished
bearing
who
regarded
us
sternly
it
necessary
he
said
tell
you
that
you
are
trespassing
the
tone
was
severe
but
not
offensive
i
saw
my
companion
draw
himself
to
his
full
height
at
all
necessary
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
surprised
me
it
was
so
nearly
insolent
are
making
our
way
to
the
road
as
quickly
as
possible
be
so
good
as
to
take
the
turning
to
the
right
when
you
reach
the
field
said
our
admonisher
coldly
and
he
turned
his
back
upon
us
i
looked
at
ireton
to
my
astonishment
he
was
pallid
the
lines
of
his
countenance
indicating
fiercest
wrath
he
marched
on
in
silence
till
we
had
reached
the
field
fellow
took
us
for
i
suppose
then
burst
from
his
lips
very
likely
why
the
devil
did
he
speak
like
that
the
grave
reproof
had
exasperated
him
he
was
flushed
and
his
hands
trembled
i
observed
him
with
the
utmost
interest
and
it
became
clear
from
the
angry
words
he
poured
forth
that
he
could
not
endure
to
be
supposed
anything
but
a
gentleman
at
large
here
was
the
old
characteristic
it
had
merely
been
dormant
i
tried
to
laugh
him
out
of
his
irritation
but
soon
saw
that
the
attempt
was
dangerous
on
the
way
home
he
talked
very
little
the
encounter
in
the
wood
had
thoroughly
upset
him
next
morning
he
came
into
my
room
with
a
laugh
that
i
did
not
like
he
seated
himself
stiffly
looked
at
me
from
beneath
his
knitted
brows
and
said
in
an
aggressive
tone
have
got
to
know
all
about
that
impudent
old
fellow
who
is
he
squire
with
an
old
house
and
a
few
acres
the
remnants
of
a
large
estate
gambled
away
by
his
father
i
know
him
by
name
and
quite
sure
that
he
knows
me
if
i
had
offered
him
my
card
as
i
thought
of
doing
i
dare
say
his
tone
would
have
changed
this
pettishness
amused
me
so
much
that
i
pretended
to
be
a
little
sore
myself
poverty
i
suppose
has
spoilt
his
temper
doubt
i
can
understand
that
he
added
with
a
smile
i
allow
people
to
treat
me
like
a
tramp
i
shall
go
up
and
see
him
this
afternoon
insist
on
an
apology
there
be
no
need
of
insisting
the
fellow
has
several
unmarried
daughters
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
companion
was
bent
on
showing
his
worst
side
i
returned
to
my
old
thoughts
of
him
he
was
snobbish
insolent
generally
detestable
but
a
man
to
be
studied
and
i
let
him
talk
as
he
would
the
reduced
squire
was
humphrey
armitage
of
brackley
hall
for
my
own
part
the
demeanour
of
this
gentleman
had
seemed
perfectly
adapted
to
the
occasion
we
were
strangers
plunging
through
his
preserves
and
his
tone
to
us
had
nothing
improper
it
was
we
who
owed
an
apology
in
point
of
breeding
i
felt
sure
that
ireton
could
not
compare
with
armitage
for
a
moment
and
it
seemed
to
me
vastly
improbable
that
the
invader
of
brackley
hall
would
meet
with
the
kind
of
reception
he
anticipated
i
saw
ireton
when
he
set
out
to
pay
his
call
his
had
provided
him
with
the
costume
of
piccadilly
from
shining
hat
to
shoes
he
was
immaculate
seeing
that
he
had
to
walk
more
than
a
mile
that
the
month
was
september
and
that
he
could
not
pretend
to
have
come
straight
from
town
this
apparel
struck
me
as
not
a
little
inappropriate
i
could
only
suppose
that
the
man
had
no
social
tact
at
seven
in
the
evening
he
again
sought
me
his
urban
glories
were
exchanged
for
the
ordinary
attire
but
i
at
once
read
in
his
face
that
he
had
suffered
no
humiliation
and
dine
with
me
at
the
inn
he
exclaimed
cordially
one
may
use
such
a
word
as
under
the
circumstances
pleasure
i
dine
with
the
armitages
he
regarded
me
with
an
air
of
infinite
satisfaction
surprised
i
held
my
peace
was
as
i
foresaw
the
old
fellow
welcomed
me
with
open
arms
his
daughters
gave
me
tea
i
had
really
a
very
pleasant
time
i
mused
and
wondered
did
expect
it
i
can
see
that
told
me
that
armitage
would
recognise
your
name
i
answered
evasively
not
long
ago
i
gave
him
through
an
agent
a
very
handsome
price
for
some
pictures
he
had
to
sell
again
he
looked
at
me
watching
the
effect
of
his
words
course
he
continued
were
ample
apologies
for
his
treatment
of
us
yesterday
by
the
bye
i
take
it
for
granted
you
do
carry
a
in
your
bag
forbid
be
sure
pray
do
misunderstand
me
i
meant
that
you
had
expressly
told
me
of
your
avoidance
of
all
such
formalities
therefore
you
will
be
glad
that
i
excused
you
from
dining
at
the
hall
for
a
moment
i
felt
uncomfortable
but
after
all
i
glad
not
to
have
the
trouble
of
refusing
on
my
own
account
i
said
did
the
right
thing
we
walked
over
to
the
inn
and
sat
down
at
a
rude
but
not
unsatisfying
table
after
dinner
ireton
proposed
that
we
should
smoke
in
the
garden
quiet
and
we
can
talk
the
sun
had
just
set
the
sky
was
magnificent
with
afterglow
ireton
hint
about
privacy
led
me
to
hope
that
he
was
going
to
talk
more
confidentially
than
hitherto
and
i
soon
found
that
i
was
not
mistaken
you
know
he
began
calling
me
by
my
name
fancy
you
have
been
criticising
me
yes
i
know
you
have
you
think
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
about
that
affair
in
the
wood
well
i
have
no
doubt
i
did
now
that
it
has
turned
out
pleasantly
i
can
see
and
admit
that
there
was
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
i
smiled
well
now
you
a
writer
you
like
to
get
at
the
souls
of
men
suppose
i
show
you
a
bit
of
mine
he
had
drunk
freely
of
the
potent
ale
and
was
now
sipping
a
strong
tumbler
of
hot
whisky
possibly
this
accounted
in
some
measure
for
his
communicativeness
to
the
age
of
i
was
clerk
in
a
drug
warehouse
to
this
day
even
the
faintest
smell
of
drugs
makes
my
heart
sink
if
i
can
help
it
i
never
go
into
a
chemist
shop
i
was
getting
a
pound
a
week
and
i
not
only
lived
on
it
but
kept
up
a
decent
appearance
i
always
had
a
good
suit
of
clothes
for
sundays
and
holidays
made
at
a
tailor
in
holborn
since
he
disappeared
i
never
been
able
to
find
any
one
who
fitted
me
so
well
i
paid
a
week
for
a
top
bedroom
in
a
street
near
gray
inn
road
did
you
suppose
i
had
gone
through
the
mill
i
made
no
answer
and
after
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
ireton
resumed
were
damned
days
it
was
the
want
of
good
food
and
good
lodgings
that
troubled
me
most
but
the
feeling
that
i
was
everybody
inferior
there
no
need
to
tell
you
how
i
was
brought
up
i
was
led
to
expect
better
things
that
enough
i
never
got
used
to
being
ordered
about
when
i
was
told
to
do
this
or
that
i
answered
with
a
silent
curse
and
i
wonder
it
did
come
out
sometimes
that
my
nature
if
i
had
been
born
the
son
of
a
duke
i
could
have
resented
a
subordinate
position
more
fiercely
than
i
did
and
i
used
to
rack
my
brain
with
schemes
for
getting
out
of
it
many
a
night
i
have
lain
awake
for
hours
trying
to
hit
on
some
way
of
earning
my
living
independently
i
planned
elaborate
forgeries
i
read
criminal
cases
in
the
newspapers
to
get
a
hint
that
i
might
work
upon
well
that
only
means
that
i
had
exhausted
all
the
honest
attempts
and
found
them
all
no
good
i
was
in
despair
that
all
he
finished
his
whisky
and
shouted
to
the
landlord
who
presently
brought
him
another
glass
that
bird
making
the
strange
noise
i
think
to
be
sitting
here
is
it
i
had
rather
be
here
than
in
the
swellest
london
club
well
i
was
going
to
tell
you
how
i
got
out
of
that
beastly
life
you
know
i
really
a
very
quiet
fellow
i
like
simple
things
but
all
my
life
till
just
lately
i
never
had
a
chance
of
enjoying
them
of
living
as
i
chose
the
one
thing
i
ca
stand
is
to
feel
that
i
am
looked
down
upon
that
makes
a
madman
of
me
he
drank
and
struck
a
match
to
relight
his
pipe
saturday
afternoon
i
went
to
an
exhibition
in
coventry
street
the
pictures
were
for
sale
and
admission
was
free
i
have
always
been
fond
of
at
that
time
it
was
one
of
my
ambitions
to
possess
a
really
good
bit
of
landscape
in
but
of
course
i
knew
that
the
prices
were
beyond
me
well
i
walked
through
the
gallery
and
there
was
one
thing
that
caught
my
fancy
i
kept
going
back
to
it
again
and
again
it
was
a
bit
of
by
ewart
merry
do
you
know
him
he
died
years
ago
his
pictures
fetch
a
fairly
good
price
now
as
i
was
looking
at
it
the
fellow
who
managed
the
show
came
up
with
a
man
and
woman
to
talk
about
another
picture
near
me
he
tried
his
hardest
to
persuade
them
to
buy
but
they
would
and
i
dare
say
it
disturbed
his
temper
seeing
him
stand
there
alone
i
stepped
up
to
him
and
asked
the
price
of
the
he
just
gave
a
look
at
me
and
said
too
much
money
for
you
you
must
remember
that
i
was
in
my
best
clothes
and
i
certainly
did
look
like
a
penniless
clerk
if
the
fellow
had
struck
a
blow
at
me
i
could
have
been
more
astonished
than
i
was
by
that
answer
astonishment
was
the
first
feeling
and
it
lasted
about
a
second
then
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
began
to
beat
violently
and
for
a
moment
i
could
see
anything
and
i
felt
hot
and
cold
by
turns
i
can
remember
this
as
well
as
if
it
happened
yesterday
i
must
have
gone
through
it
in
memory
many
thousands
of
times
i
observed
his
face
and
saw
that
even
now
he
suffered
from
the
recollection
he
had
spoken
the
blackguard
turned
away
i
could
move
and
the
wonder
is
that
i
did
swallow
his
insult
and
sneak
out
of
the
place
i
was
so
accustomed
you
see
to
repress
myself
but
of
a
sudden
something
took
hold
of
me
and
pushed
me
forward
it
really
did
seem
to
be
my
own
will
i
said
wait
a
minute
and
the
man
turned
round
then
i
stood
looking
him
in
the
eyes
are
you
here
i
said
to
sell
pictures
or
to
insult
people
who
come
to
buy
i
must
have
spoken
in
a
voice
he
expect
he
could
answer
and
stared
at
me
i
asked
you
the
price
of
that
and
you
will
be
good
enough
to
answer
me
civilly
those
were
my
very
words
they
came
without
thinking
and
afterwards
i
felt
satisfied
with
myself
when
i
remembered
them
it
would
have
been
unnatural
if
i
had
sworn
at
him
but
this
was
the
of
my
life
and
i
behaved
in
a
way
that
surprised
myself
at
last
he
replied
the
price
is
forty
guineas
and
he
was
going
off
again
but
i
stopped
him
i
will
buy
it
take
my
name
and
address
when
will
it
be
paid
for
he
asked
on
monday
followed
him
to
the
table
and
he
entered
my
name
and
address
in
a
book
then
i
looked
straight
at
him
again
now
you
understand
i
said
that
that
picture
is
mine
and
i
shall
either
come
or
send
for
it
about
one
on
monday
if
i
had
wanted
it
specially
you
would
have
lost
a
sale
by
your
impertinence
and
i
marched
out
of
the
room
i
was
in
a
fearful
state
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
i
walked
straight
on
street
after
street
and
just
missed
being
run
over
half
a
dozen
times
perspiration
dripped
from
me
the
only
thing
i
knew
was
that
i
had
triumphed
over
a
damned
brute
who
had
insulted
me
i
had
stopped
his
mouth
he
believed
he
had
made
a
stupid
mistake
he
could
never
have
imagined
that
a
fellow
without
a
sovereign
in
the
world
was
speaking
to
him
like
that
if
i
had
knocked
him
down
the
satisfaction
would
have
been
very
slight
in
comparison
the
gloom
of
nightfall
had
come
upon
us
and
i
could
no
longer
see
his
face
distinctly
but
his
voice
told
me
that
he
still
savoured
that
triumph
he
spoke
with
exultant
passion
i
was
beginning
to
understand
ireton
the
story
interesting
he
asked
after
a
pause
pray
go
on
you
must
suppose
that
it
was
a
mere
bit
of
crazy
bravado
i
knew
how
i
was
going
to
get
the
money
the
forty
guineas
and
as
soon
as
i
could
command
myself
i
went
to
do
the
business
in
the
drug
warehouse
had
been
badly
in
want
of
money
not
long
before
that
and
i
knew
he
had
borrowed
twenty
pounds
from
a
loan
office
paying
it
back
week
by
week
with
heavy
interest
out
of
his
screw
poor
devil
i
could
do
the
same
i
went
straight
off
to
the
lender
it
was
a
fellow
called
crowther
he
lived
in
dean
street
soho
in
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
there
was
a
card
with
sums
from
one
pound
to
a
hundred
lent
at
short
notice
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
him
at
home
we
did
our
business
in
a
little
back
room
where
there
was
a
desk
and
a
couple
of
chairs
and
nothing
else
but
dirt
i
expected
to
find
an
oldish
man
but
he
seemed
about
my
own
age
and
on
the
whole
i
did
dislike
the
look
of
him
a
rather
handsome
young
fellow
fairly
well
dressed
with
a
taking
sort
of
smile
i
began
by
telling
him
where
i
was
employed
and
mentioned
my
whom
he
knew
that
made
him
quite
cheerful
he
offered
me
a
drink
and
we
got
on
very
well
but
he
thought
forty
guineas
a
big
sum
would
i
tell
him
what
i
wanted
it
for
no
i
would
do
that
well
how
long
would
it
take
me
to
pay
it
back
could
i
pay
a
pound
a
week
no
i
could
he
began
to
shake
his
head
and
to
look
at
me
thoughtfully
then
he
asked
no
end
of
questions
to
find
out
who
i
was
and
what
people
i
had
belonging
to
me
and
what
my
chances
were
then
he
made
me
have
another
drink
and
at
last
i
was
persuaded
into
telling
him
the
whole
story
first
of
all
he
stared
and
then
he
laughed
i
never
saw
a
man
laugh
more
heartily
at
last
he
said
why
did
you
tell
me
you
had
value
in
hand
see
here
i
look
at
that
picture
on
monday
morning
and
i
wonder
if
we
can
do
business
this
alarmed
me
i
was
afraid
he
might
get
talking
to
the
but
he
promised
not
to
say
a
word
about
me
sunday
i
sent
a
note
to
the
warehouse
saying
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
come
to
business
till
monday
afternoon
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
done
such
a
thing
and
i
knew
i
could
invent
some
story
to
excuse
myself
most
of
that
day
i
spent
in
bed
i
did
feel
myself
yet
it
was
still
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
that
i
had
got
the
better
of
that
brute
on
monday
at
twelve
i
kept
the
appointment
in
dean
street
crowther
had
come
in
and
i
sat
for
a
few
minutes
quaking
when
he
turned
up
he
was
quite
cheerful
look
here
he
said
will
you
sell
me
that
picture
for
thirty
pounds
what
then
i
asked
why
then
you
can
pay
me
another
thirty
pounds
and
i
give
you
twelve
months
to
do
it
in
you
shall
have
your
forty
guineas
at
once
i
tried
to
reflect
but
i
was
too
agitated
however
i
saw
that
to
pay
thirty
pounds
in
a
year
meant
that
i
must
live
on
about
eight
shillings
a
week
i
do
know
how
i
to
do
it
i
said
he
looked
at
me
well
i
wo
be
hard
on
you
look
here
you
shall
pay
me
six
bob
a
week
till
the
thirty
quid
made
up
now
you
can
do
yes
i
could
do
that
and
i
agreed
in
another
ten
minutes
our
business
was
settled
my
signature
was
so
shaky
that
i
might
safely
have
disowned
it
afterwards
then
we
had
a
drink
at
a
neighbouring
pub
and
we
walked
together
towards
coventry
street
crowther
was
to
wait
for
me
near
the
entered
with
a
bold
step
promising
myself
pleasure
in
a
new
triumph
over
the
brute
but
he
was
there
i
saw
only
an
i
had
no
time
to
lose
for
i
must
be
at
business
by
two
i
paid
the
money
notes
and
gold
and
took
away
the
picture
under
my
arm
of
course
it
had
been
removed
from
the
frame
in
which
i
first
saw
it
and
the
assistant
wrapped
it
up
for
me
in
brown
paper
at
the
street
corner
i
surrendered
it
to
crowther
come
and
see
me
after
business
he
said
i
should
like
to
have
a
bit
more
talk
with
you
i
had
come
out
of
it
gloriously
i
cared
nothing
about
losing
the
picture
and
i
did
grieve
over
the
six
shillings
a
week
that
i
should
have
to
pay
for
the
next
two
years
if
i
went
into
that
gallery
again
i
should
be
treated
respectfully
that
was
sufficient
he
laughed
and
for
a
minute
or
two
we
sat
silent
from
the
inn
sounded
rustic
voices
the
village
worthies
were
gathered
for
their
evening
conversation
the
best
part
of
my
story
said
ireton
at
length
followed
is
commonplace
still
you
might
like
to
hear
how
i
bridged
the
gulf
from
fourteen
shillings
a
week
to
the
position
i
now
hold
well
i
got
very
intimate
with
crowther
and
found
him
really
a
very
decent
fellow
he
had
a
good
many
irons
in
the
fire
besides
his
loan
office
which
paid
much
better
than
you
would
imagine
he
had
a
turf
commission
agency
which
brought
him
in
a
good
deal
of
money
and
shortly
after
i
met
him
he
became
part
proprietor
of
a
club
in
soho
he
very
soon
talked
to
me
in
the
frankest
way
of
all
his
doings
i
think
he
was
glad
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
me
simply
because
i
was
better
educated
and
could
behave
decently
i
do
think
he
ever
did
anything
illegal
and
he
had
plenty
of
good
feeling
but
that
did
prevent
him
from
squeezing
eighty
per
cent
or
so
out
of
many
a
poor
devil
who
had
borrowed
to
save
himself
or
his
family
from
starvation
that
was
all
business
he
drew
the
sharpest
distinctions
between
business
and
private
relations
and
was
very
ignorant
i
never
knew
a
man
so
superstitious
every
day
he
consulted
signs
and
omens
for
instance
to
decide
whether
the
day
was
to
be
lucky
for
him
in
betting
and
so
on
he
would
stand
at
a
street
corner
and
count
the
number
of
white
horses
that
passed
in
five
minutes
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
on
an
even
number
and
an
even
number
passed
then
he
felt
safe
in
following
his
impulses
for
the
day
if
the
number
were
odd
he
would
do
little
or
no
speculation
when
he
was
going
to
play
cards
for
money
he
would
find
a
beggar
and
give
him
something
even
if
he
had
to
walk
a
great
distance
to
do
it
he
often
used
to
visit
an
italian
who
kept
canaries
and
he
always
followed
the
advice
he
got
it
put
him
out
desperately
if
he
saw
the
new
moon
through
glass
or
over
his
left
shoulder
there
was
no
end
to
his
superstitions
and
whether
by
reason
of
them
or
in
spite
of
them
he
certainly
prospered
when
he
died
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
he
left
fifteen
thousand
pounds
have
to
thank
him
for
my
own
good
luck
look
here
he
said
to
me
it
only
duffers
that
go
on
at
a
quid
a
week
a
fellow
like
you
ought
to
be
doing
better
show
me
the
way
i
said
and
i
was
ready
to
do
whatever
he
told
me
i
had
a
furious
hunger
for
money
the
adventure
in
coventry
street
had
thoroughly
unsettled
me
and
i
would
have
turned
burglar
rather
than
go
on
much
longer
as
a
wretched
slave
looked
down
upon
by
everybody
and
exposed
to
insult
at
every
corner
i
dreamed
of
and
woke
up
feverish
with
determination
at
last
crowther
gave
me
a
few
jobs
to
do
for
him
in
my
they
were
very
nice
jobs
and
i
should
like
to
explain
them
to
you
but
they
brought
me
in
half
a
sovereign
now
and
then
i
began
to
get
an
insight
into
the
baser
modes
of
filling
one
pocket
then
something
happened
my
mother
died
and
i
became
the
owner
of
a
house
at
notting
hill
of
fifty
pounds
rental
i
talked
over
my
situation
with
crowther
and
he
advised
me
as
it
turned
out
thoroughly
well
i
was
to
raise
money
on
this
house
not
to
sell
it
and
take
shares
in
a
new
which
crowther
was
connected
with
there
no
reason
why
i
should
tell
you
it
was
the
marlborough
i
did
take
shares
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
twelve
months
i
was
drawing
a
dividend
of
sixty
per
cent
i
have
never
drawn
less
than
thirty
and
the
year
before
last
we
touched
at
present
i
am
a
shareholder
in
three
other
halls
and
they
do
do
badly
suppose
it
is
only
good
luck
no
doubt
i
have
a
sort
of
talent
for
but
i
never
knew
it
before
i
met
crowther
by
just
opening
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
money
could
be
earned
in
other
ways
than
at
the
regular
kinds
of
employment
he
gave
me
a
start
and
i
went
ahead
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
has
suffered
more
than
i
have
for
want
of
money
and
no
one
ever
worked
with
a
fiercer
resolve
to
get
out
of
the
hell
of
contemptible
poverty
it
would
fill
a
book
the
history
of
my
the
first
big
sum
i
ever
was
possessed
of
came
to
me
at
the
age
of
when
i
sold
a
proprietary
club
the
one
crowther
had
a
share
in
and
which
i
had
ultimately
got
into
my
own
hands
for
nine
thousand
pounds
but
i
owed
about
half
of
this
i
went
on
and
on
and
i
got
into
society
came
through
the
marlborough
a
good
story
but
i
must
tell
it
at
last
i
married
a
rich
woman
he
paused
and
i
thought
but
was
not
quite
sure
that
i
heard
him
sigh
wo
talk
about
that
either
i
shall
not
marry
a
rich
woman
again
that
all
in
fact
i
do
care
for
such
people
my
best
friends
real
friends
are
all
more
or
less
strugglers
and
perhaps
there
no
harm
in
saying
that
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
help
them
when
i
a
chance
i
like
to
buy
a
picture
of
a
poor
devil
artist
i
like
to
smoke
my
pipe
with
good
fellows
who
never
go
out
of
their
way
for
money
sake
all
the
same
a
good
thing
to
be
well
off
but
for
that
now
i
could
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
people
as
these
at
brackley
hall
i
more
than
half
like
them
old
armitage
is
a
gentleman
and
looks
back
upon
generations
of
gentlemen
his
ancestors
ah
you
ca
buy
that
and
his
daughters
are
devilish
nice
girls
with
sweet
soft
voices
i
glad
the
old
fellow
met
us
yesterday
it
was
now
dark
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
stars
brightening
we
sat
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
each
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
then
rose
and
parted
for
the
night
a
week
later
when
i
returned
to
london
ireton
was
still
living
at
the
little
inn
and
a
letter
i
received
from
him
at
the
beginning
of
october
told
me
he
had
just
left
country
was
exquisite
that
last
week
he
wrote
and
it
struck
me
that
was
a
word
he
must
have
caught
from
some
one
else
lips
i
heard
from
him
again
in
the
following
january
he
wrote
from
the
isle
of
wight
and
informed
me
that
in
the
spring
he
was
to
be
married
to
miss
ethel
armitage
second
daughter
of
humphrey
armitage
of
brackley
hall
christopherson
it
was
twenty
years
ago
and
on
an
evening
in
may
all
day
long
there
had
been
sunshine
owing
doubtless
to
the
incident
i
am
about
to
relate
the
light
and
warmth
of
that
day
live
with
me
still
i
can
see
the
great
white
clouds
that
moved
across
the
strip
of
sky
before
my
window
and
feel
again
the
spring
languor
which
troubled
my
solitary
work
in
the
heart
of
london
only
at
sunset
did
i
leave
the
house
there
was
an
unwonted
sweetness
in
the
air
the
long
vistas
of
newly
lit
lamps
made
a
golden
glow
under
the
dusking
flush
of
the
sky
with
no
purpose
but
to
rest
and
breathe
i
wandered
for
half
an
hour
and
found
myself
at
length
where
great
portland
street
opens
into
marylebone
road
over
the
way
in
the
shadow
of
trinity
church
was
an
old
bookshop
well
known
to
me
the
shining
upon
the
stall
with
its
rows
of
volumes
drew
me
across
i
began
turning
over
pages
and
invariable
consequence
fingering
what
money
i
had
in
my
pocket
a
certain
book
overcame
me
i
stepped
into
the
little
shop
to
pay
for
it
while
standing
at
the
stall
i
had
been
vaguely
aware
of
some
one
beside
me
a
man
who
also
was
looking
over
the
books
as
i
came
out
again
with
my
purchase
this
stranger
gazed
at
me
intently
with
a
of
peculiar
interest
he
seemed
about
to
say
something
i
walked
slowly
away
the
man
moved
in
the
same
direction
just
in
front
of
the
church
he
made
a
quick
movement
to
my
side
and
spoke
excuse
me
sir
do
misunderstand
me
i
only
wished
to
ask
whether
you
have
noticed
the
name
written
on
the
flyleaf
of
the
book
you
have
just
bought
the
respectful
nervousness
of
his
voice
naturally
made
me
suppose
at
first
that
the
man
was
going
to
beg
but
he
seemed
no
ordinary
mendicant
i
judged
him
to
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
his
long
thin
hair
and
straggling
beard
were
grizzled
and
a
somewhat
rheumy
eye
looked
out
from
his
bloodless
hollowed
countenance
he
was
very
shabbily
clad
yet
as
a
fallen
gentleman
and
indeed
his
accent
made
it
clear
to
what
class
he
originally
belonged
the
expression
with
which
he
regarded
me
had
so
much
intelligence
so
much
and
at
the
same
time
such
a
pathetic
diffidence
that
i
could
not
but
answer
him
in
the
friendliest
way
i
had
not
seen
the
name
on
the
flyleaf
but
at
once
i
opened
the
book
and
by
the
light
of
a
read
inscribed
in
a
very
fine
hand
christopherson
is
my
name
said
the
stranger
in
a
subdued
and
uncertain
voice
the
book
used
to
belong
to
you
belonged
to
me
he
laughed
oddly
a
tremulous
little
crow
of
a
laugh
at
the
same
time
stroking
his
head
as
if
to
deprecate
disbelief
never
heard
of
the
sale
of
the
christopherson
library
to
be
sure
you
were
too
young
it
was
in
i
have
often
come
across
books
with
my
name
in
them
on
the
stalls
often
i
had
happened
to
notice
this
just
before
you
came
up
and
when
i
saw
you
look
at
it
i
was
curious
to
see
whether
you
would
buy
it
pray
excuse
the
freedom
i
am
taking
lovers
of
books
you
think
the
broken
question
was
completed
by
his
look
and
when
i
said
that
i
quite
understood
and
agreed
with
him
he
crowed
his
little
laugh
you
a
large
library
he
inquired
eyeing
me
wistfully
dear
no
only
a
few
hundred
volumes
too
many
for
one
who
has
no
house
of
his
own
he
smiled
bent
his
head
and
murmured
just
audibly
catalogue
numbered
i
was
growing
curious
and
interested
venturing
no
more
direct
questions
i
asked
whether
at
the
time
he
spoke
of
he
lived
in
london
you
have
five
minutes
to
spare
was
the
timid
reply
will
show
you
my
house
i
mean
again
the
little
crowing
laugh
house
which
mine
willingly
i
walked
on
with
him
he
led
me
a
short
distance
up
the
road
skirting
regent
park
and
paused
at
length
before
a
house
in
an
imposing
terrace
he
whispered
used
to
live
the
window
to
the
right
of
the
door
that
was
my
library
ah
and
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
misfortune
befell
you
i
said
also
in
a
subdued
voice
result
of
my
own
folly
i
had
enough
for
my
needs
but
thought
i
needed
more
i
let
myself
be
drawn
into
business
i
who
knew
nothing
of
such
things
and
there
came
the
black
day
the
black
day
we
turned
to
retrace
our
steps
and
walking
slowly
with
heads
bent
came
in
silence
again
to
the
church
wonder
whether
you
have
bought
any
other
of
my
books
asked
christopherson
with
his
gentle
smile
when
we
had
paused
as
if
for
i
replied
that
i
did
not
remember
to
have
come
across
his
name
before
then
on
an
impulse
asked
whether
he
would
care
to
have
the
book
i
carried
in
my
hand
if
so
with
pleasure
i
would
give
it
him
no
sooner
were
the
words
spoken
than
i
saw
the
delight
they
caused
the
hearer
he
hesitated
murmured
reluctance
but
soon
gratefully
accepted
my
offer
and
flushed
with
joy
as
he
took
the
volume
still
have
a
few
books
he
said
under
his
breath
as
if
he
spoke
of
something
he
was
ashamed
to
make
known
it
is
very
rarely
indeed
that
i
can
add
to
them
i
feel
i
have
not
thanked
you
half
enough
we
shook
hands
and
parted
my
lodging
at
that
time
was
in
camden
town
one
afternoon
perhaps
a
fortnight
later
i
had
walked
for
an
hour
or
two
and
on
my
way
back
i
stopped
at
a
bookstall
in
the
high
street
some
one
came
up
to
my
side
i
looked
and
recognised
christopherson
our
greeting
was
like
that
of
old
friends
have
seen
you
several
times
lately
said
the
broken
gentleman
who
looked
shabbier
than
before
in
the
broad
daylight
i
i
did
like
to
speak
i
live
not
far
from
here
so
do
i
and
i
added
without
much
thinking
what
i
said
you
live
alone
oh
no
with
my
wife
there
was
a
curious
embarrassment
in
his
tone
his
eyes
were
cast
down
and
his
head
moved
uneasily
we
began
to
talk
of
the
books
on
the
stall
and
turning
away
together
continued
our
conversation
christopherson
was
not
only
a
but
a
very
intelligent
and
even
learned
man
on
his
giving
some
proof
of
erudition
with
the
excessive
modesty
which
characterised
him
i
asked
whether
he
wrote
no
he
had
never
written
anything
never
he
was
only
a
bookworm
he
said
thereupon
he
crowed
faintly
and
took
his
leave
it
was
not
long
before
we
again
met
by
chance
we
came
face
to
face
at
a
street
corner
in
my
neighbourhood
and
i
was
struck
by
a
change
in
him
he
looked
older
a
profound
melancholy
darkened
his
countenance
the
hand
he
gave
me
was
limp
and
his
pleasure
at
our
meeting
found
only
a
faint
expression
am
going
away
he
said
in
reply
to
my
inquiring
look
am
leaving
london
good
fear
so
and
yet
he
made
an
obvious
effort
am
glad
of
it
my
wife
health
has
not
been
very
good
lately
she
has
need
of
country
air
yes
i
am
glad
we
have
decided
to
go
away
very
glad
very
glad
indeed
he
spoke
with
an
automatic
sort
of
emphasis
his
eyes
wandering
and
his
hands
twitching
nervously
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
what
part
of
the
country
he
had
chosen
for
his
retreat
when
he
abruptly
added
live
just
over
there
will
you
let
me
show
you
my
books
of
course
i
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
and
a
couple
of
minutes
walk
brought
us
to
a
house
in
a
decent
street
where
most
of
the
windows
showed
a
card
announcing
lodgings
as
we
paused
at
the
door
my
companion
seemed
to
hesitate
to
regret
having
invited
me
really
afraid
it
is
worth
your
while
he
said
timidly
fact
is
i
have
space
to
show
my
books
properly
i
put
aside
the
objection
and
we
entered
with
anxious
courtesy
christopherson
led
me
up
the
narrow
staircase
to
the
landing
and
threw
open
a
door
on
the
threshold
i
stood
astonished
the
room
was
a
small
one
and
would
in
any
case
have
only
just
sufficed
for
homely
comfort
used
as
it
evidently
was
for
all
daytime
purposes
but
certainly
a
third
of
the
entire
space
was
occupied
by
a
solid
mass
of
books
volumes
stacked
several
rows
deep
against
two
of
the
walls
and
almost
up
to
the
ceiling
a
round
table
and
two
or
three
chairs
were
the
only
furniture
there
was
no
room
indeed
for
more
the
window
being
shut
and
the
sunshine
glowing
upon
it
an
intolerable
stuffiness
oppressed
the
air
never
had
i
been
made
so
uncomfortable
by
the
odour
of
printed
paper
and
bindings
i
exclaimed
said
you
had
only
a
books
there
must
be
five
times
as
many
here
as
i
have
forget
the
exact
number
murmured
christopherson
in
great
agitation
see
i
ca
arrange
them
properly
i
have
a
few
more
in
in
the
other
room
he
led
me
across
the
landing
opened
another
door
and
showed
me
a
little
bedroom
here
the
encumberment
was
less
remarkable
but
one
wall
had
completely
disappeared
behind
volumes
and
the
bookishness
of
the
air
made
it
a
disgusting
thought
that
two
persons
occupied
this
chamber
every
night
we
returned
to
the
christopherson
began
picking
out
books
from
the
solid
mass
to
show
me
talking
nervously
brokenly
with
now
and
then
a
deep
sigh
or
a
crow
of
laughter
he
gave
me
a
little
light
on
his
history
i
learnt
that
he
had
occupied
these
lodgings
for
the
last
eight
years
that
he
had
been
twice
married
that
the
only
child
he
had
had
a
daughter
by
his
first
wife
had
died
long
ago
in
childhood
and
lastly
this
came
in
a
burst
of
confidence
with
a
very
pleasant
smile
that
his
second
wife
had
been
his
daughter
governess
i
listened
with
keen
interest
and
hoped
to
learn
still
more
of
the
circumstances
of
this
singular
household
the
country
i
remarked
will
no
doubt
have
shelf
room
at
once
his
countenance
fell
he
turned
upon
me
a
woebegone
eye
just
as
i
was
about
to
speak
again
sounds
from
within
the
house
caught
my
attention
there
was
a
heavy
foot
on
the
stairs
and
a
loud
voice
which
seemed
familiar
to
me
exclaimed
christopherson
with
a
start
comes
some
one
who
is
going
to
help
me
in
the
removal
of
the
books
come
in
pomfret
come
in
the
door
opened
and
there
appeared
a
tall
wiry
fellow
whose
sandy
hair
light
blue
eyes
jutting
jawbones
and
large
mouth
made
a
picture
suggestive
of
small
refinement
but
of
vigorous
and
wholesome
manhood
no
wonder
i
had
seemed
to
recognise
his
voice
though
we
only
saw
each
other
by
chance
at
long
intervals
pomfret
and
i
were
old
acquaintances
he
roared
out
did
know
you
knew
mr
christopherson
just
as
much
surprised
to
find
that
know
him
was
my
reply
the
old
gazed
at
us
in
nervous
astonishment
then
shook
hands
with
the
newcomer
who
greeted
him
bluffly
yet
respectfully
pomfret
spoke
with
a
strong
yorkshire
accent
and
had
all
the
angularity
of
demeanour
which
marks
the
typical
yorkshireman
he
came
to
announce
that
everything
had
been
settled
for
the
packing
and
transporting
of
library
it
remained
only
to
decide
the
day
no
hurry
exclaimed
christopherson
really
no
hurry
greatly
obliged
to
you
pomfret
for
all
the
trouble
you
are
taking
we
settle
the
date
in
a
day
or
two
a
day
or
two
with
a
nod
pomfret
moved
to
take
his
leave
our
eyes
met
we
left
the
house
together
out
in
the
street
again
i
took
a
deep
breath
of
the
summer
air
which
seemed
sweet
as
in
a
meadow
after
that
stifling
room
my
companion
evidently
had
a
like
sensation
for
he
looked
up
to
the
sky
and
broadened
out
his
shoulders
but
it
a
grand
day
i
give
something
for
a
walk
on
ilkley
moors
as
the
best
substitute
within
our
reach
we
agreed
to
walk
across
park
together
pomfret
business
took
him
in
that
direction
and
i
was
glad
of
a
talk
about
christopherson
i
learnt
that
the
old
landlady
was
pomfret
aunt
christopherson
story
of
affluence
and
ruin
was
quite
true
ruin
complete
for
at
the
age
of
forty
he
had
been
obliged
to
earn
his
living
as
a
clerk
or
something
of
the
kind
about
five
years
later
came
his
second
marriage
know
mrs
christopherson
asked
pomfret
i
wish
i
did
why
she
the
sort
of
woman
it
does
you
good
to
know
that
all
she
a
lady
idea
of
a
lady
christopherson
a
gentleman
too
there
no
denying
it
if
he
was
i
think
i
should
have
punched
his
head
before
now
oh
i
know
well
why
i
lived
in
the
house
there
with
for
several
years
she
a
lady
to
the
end
of
her
little
finger
and
how
her
husband
can
borne
to
see
her
living
the
life
she
has
it
more
than
i
can
understand
by
i
have
turned
burglar
if
i
could
found
no
other
way
of
keeping
her
in
comfort
works
for
her
living
then
and
for
his
too
no
not
teaching
she
in
a
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
has
what
they
call
a
good
place
and
earns
thirty
shillings
a
week
it
all
they
have
but
christopherson
buys
books
out
of
it
has
he
never
done
anything
since
their
marriage
did
for
the
first
few
years
i
believe
but
he
had
an
illness
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
since
then
he
only
loafed
he
goes
to
all
the
and
spends
the
rest
of
his
time
sniffing
about
the
shops
she
oh
she
never
say
a
word
wait
till
you
seen
her
but
i
asked
has
happened
how
is
it
they
leaving
london
i
tell
you
i
was
coming
to
that
christopherson
has
relatives
well
off
a
fat
and
selfish
lot
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
never
lifted
a
finger
to
help
her
until
now
one
of
them
a
keeting
the
widow
of
some
city
porpoise
i
told
well
this
woman
has
a
home
down
in
norfolk
she
never
lives
there
but
a
son
of
hers
goes
there
to
fish
and
shoot
now
and
then
well
this
is
what
christopherson
tells
my
aunt
keeting
has
offered
to
let
her
and
her
husband
live
down
yonder
rent
free
and
their
food
provided
she
to
be
housekeeper
in
fact
and
keep
the
place
ready
for
any
one
who
goes
down
can
see
would
rather
stay
where
he
is
of
course
he
does
know
how
he
live
without
the
bookshops
but
he
glad
for
all
that
on
his
wife
account
and
it
none
too
soon
i
can
tell
you
the
poor
woman
could
go
on
much
longer
my
aunt
says
just
about
ready
to
drop
and
sometimes
i
know
she
looks
terribly
bad
of
course
she
wo
own
it
not
she
she
is
one
of
the
complaining
sort
but
she
talks
now
and
then
about
the
country
the
places
where
she
used
to
live
i
heard
her
and
it
gives
me
a
notion
of
what
she
gone
through
all
these
years
i
saw
her
a
week
ago
just
when
she
had
offer
and
i
tell
you
i
scarcely
knew
who
it
was
you
never
saw
such
a
change
in
any
one
in
your
life
her
face
was
like
that
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
her
laugh
you
should
have
heard
her
laugh
she
much
younger
than
her
husband
i
asked
years
at
least
she
about
forty
i
think
i
mused
for
a
few
moments
all
it
is
an
unhappy
marriage
cried
pomfret
there
never
been
a
disagreeable
word
between
them
that
i
warrant
once
christopherson
gets
over
the
change
they
have
nothing
more
in
the
world
to
ask
for
he
potter
over
his
books
mean
to
tell
me
i
interrupted
those
books
have
all
been
bought
out
of
his
wife
thirty
shillings
a
week
no
to
begin
with
he
kept
a
few
out
of
his
old
library
then
when
he
was
earning
his
own
living
he
bought
a
great
many
he
told
me
once
that
he
often
lived
on
sixpence
a
day
to
have
money
for
books
a
rum
old
owl
but
for
all
that
he
a
gentleman
and
you
ca
help
liking
him
i
shall
be
sorry
when
he
out
of
reach
for
my
own
part
i
wished
nothing
better
than
to
hear
of
departure
the
story
i
had
heard
made
me
uncomfortable
it
was
good
to
think
of
that
poor
woman
rescued
at
last
from
her
life
of
toil
and
in
these
days
of
midsummer
free
to
enjoy
the
country
she
loved
a
touch
of
envy
mingled
i
confess
with
my
thought
of
christopherson
who
henceforth
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
and
without
reproach
might
delight
in
his
hoarded
volumes
one
could
not
imagine
that
he
would
suffer
seriously
by
the
removal
of
his
old
haunts
i
promised
myself
to
call
on
him
in
a
day
or
two
by
choosing
sunday
i
might
perhaps
be
lucky
enough
to
see
his
wife
and
on
sunday
afternoon
i
was
on
the
point
of
setting
forth
to
pay
this
visit
when
in
came
pomfret
he
wore
a
surly
look
and
kicked
clumsily
against
the
furniture
as
he
crossed
the
room
his
appearance
was
a
surprise
for
though
i
had
given
him
my
address
i
did
not
in
the
least
expect
that
he
would
come
to
see
me
a
certain
pride
i
suppose
characteristic
of
his
rugged
strain
having
always
made
him
shy
of
such
intimacy
you
ever
hear
the
like
of
he
shouted
half
angrily
all
over
they
not
going
and
all
because
of
those
blamed
books
and
spluttering
and
growling
he
made
known
what
he
had
just
learnt
at
his
aunt
home
on
the
previous
afternoon
the
christophersons
had
been
surprised
by
a
visit
from
their
relatives
and
benefactress
keeting
never
before
had
that
lady
called
upon
them
she
came
no
doubt
this
could
only
be
conjectured
to
speak
with
them
of
their
approaching
removal
the
close
of
the
conversation
a
very
brief
one
was
overheard
by
the
landlady
for
keeting
spoke
loudly
as
she
descended
the
stairs
quite
impossible
i
could
think
of
it
how
could
you
dream
for
a
moment
that
i
would
let
you
fill
my
house
with
musty
old
books
most
unhealthy
i
never
knew
anything
so
extraordinary
in
my
life
never
and
so
she
went
out
to
her
carriage
and
was
driven
away
and
the
landlady
presently
having
occasion
to
go
upstairs
was
aware
of
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
where
the
christophersons
were
sitting
she
knocked
prepared
with
some
excuse
and
found
the
couple
side
by
side
smiling
sadly
at
once
they
told
her
the
truth
keeting
had
come
because
of
a
letter
in
which
christopherson
had
mentioned
the
fact
that
her
husband
had
a
good
many
books
and
hoped
he
might
be
permitted
to
remove
them
to
the
house
in
norfolk
she
came
to
see
the
library
with
the
result
already
heard
they
had
the
choice
between
sacrificing
the
books
and
losing
what
their
relative
offered
refused
i
let
fall
suppose
his
wife
saw
that
it
was
too
much
for
him
at
all
events
agreed
to
keep
the
books
and
lose
the
house
and
there
an
end
of
it
i
have
been
so
riled
about
anything
for
a
long
time
meantime
i
had
been
reflecting
it
was
easy
for
me
to
understand
christopherson
state
of
mind
and
without
knowing
keeting
i
saw
that
she
must
be
a
person
whose
benefactions
would
be
a
good
deal
of
a
burden
after
all
was
christopherson
so
very
unhappy
was
she
not
the
kind
of
woman
who
lived
by
sacrifice
one
who
had
far
rather
lead
a
life
disagreeable
to
herself
than
change
it
at
the
cost
of
discomfort
to
her
husband
this
view
of
the
matter
irritated
pomfret
and
he
broke
into
objurgations
directed
partly
against
keeting
partly
against
christopherson
it
was
an
shame
that
was
all
he
could
say
and
after
all
i
rather
inclined
to
his
opinion
when
two
or
three
days
had
passed
curiosity
drew
me
towards
the
christophersons
dwelling
walking
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
i
looked
up
at
their
window
and
there
was
the
face
of
the
old
bibliophile
evidently
he
was
standing
at
the
window
in
idleness
perhaps
in
trouble
at
once
he
beckoned
to
me
but
before
i
could
knock
at
the
he
had
descended
and
came
out
i
walk
a
little
way
with
you
he
asked
there
was
worry
on
his
features
for
some
moments
we
went
on
in
silence
you
have
changed
your
mind
about
leaving
london
i
said
as
if
carelessly
have
heard
from
pomfret
well
yes
yes
i
think
we
shall
stay
where
we
are
for
the
present
never
have
i
seen
a
man
more
painfully
embarrassed
he
walked
with
head
bent
shoulders
stooping
and
shuffled
indeed
rather
than
walked
even
so
might
a
man
bear
himself
who
felt
guilty
of
some
peculiar
meanness
presently
words
broke
from
him
tell
you
the
truth
there
a
difficulty
about
the
books
he
glanced
furtively
at
me
and
i
saw
he
was
trembling
in
all
his
nerves
you
see
my
circumstances
are
not
brilliant
he
himself
with
a
crow
fact
is
we
were
offered
a
house
in
the
country
on
certain
conditions
by
a
relative
of
christopherson
and
unfortunately
it
turned
out
that
my
library
is
regarded
as
an
objection
a
fatal
objection
we
have
quite
reconciled
ourselves
to
staying
where
we
are
i
could
not
help
asking
without
emphasis
whether
christopherson
would
have
cared
for
life
in
the
country
but
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
than
i
regretted
them
so
evidently
did
they
hit
my
companion
in
a
tender
place
think
she
would
have
liked
it
he
answered
with
a
strangely
pathetic
look
at
me
as
if
he
entreated
my
forbearance
i
suggested
you
make
some
arrangements
about
the
books
could
you
take
a
room
for
them
in
another
house
for
instance
christopherson
face
was
sufficient
answer
it
reminded
me
of
his
pennilessness
think
no
more
about
it
he
said
matter
is
settled
quite
settled
there
was
no
pursuing
the
subject
at
the
next
parting
of
the
ways
we
took
leave
of
each
other
i
think
it
was
not
more
than
a
week
later
when
i
received
a
postcard
from
pomfret
he
wrote
as
i
expected
seriously
that
was
all
could
of
course
only
mean
christopherson
i
mused
over
the
message
it
took
hold
of
my
imagination
wrought
upon
my
feelings
and
that
afternoon
i
again
walked
along
the
interesting
street
there
was
no
face
at
the
window
after
a
little
hesitation
i
decided
to
call
at
the
house
and
speak
with
pomfret
aunt
it
was
she
who
opened
the
door
to
me
we
had
never
seen
each
other
but
when
i
mentioned
my
name
and
said
i
was
anxious
to
have
news
of
christopherson
she
led
me
into
a
and
began
to
talk
confidentially
she
was
a
yorkshirewoman
very
unlike
the
common
london
landlady
christopherson
had
been
taken
ill
two
days
ago
it
began
with
a
long
fainting
fit
she
had
a
feverish
sleepless
night
the
doctor
was
sent
for
and
he
had
her
removed
out
of
the
stuffy
bedroom
into
another
chamber
which
luckily
happened
to
be
vacant
there
she
lay
utterly
weak
and
worn
all
but
voiceless
able
only
to
smile
at
her
husband
who
never
moved
from
the
bedside
day
or
night
he
too
said
the
landlady
soon
break
down
he
looked
like
a
ghost
and
seemed
i
asked
be
the
cause
of
this
illness
the
good
woman
gave
me
an
odd
look
shook
her
head
and
murmured
that
the
reason
was
not
far
to
seek
she
think
i
asked
disappointment
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
why
of
course
she
did
for
a
long
time
the
poor
lady
had
been
all
but
at
the
end
of
her
strength
and
came
as
a
blow
beneath
which
she
sank
nephew
and
i
have
talked
about
it
i
said
thinks
that
christopherson
did
understand
what
a
sacrifice
he
asked
his
wife
to
make
think
so
too
was
the
reply
he
begins
to
see
it
now
i
can
tell
you
he
says
nothing
but
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
hurried
tremulous
voice
begged
the
landlady
to
go
upstairs
is
it
sir
she
asked
afraid
she
worse
said
christopherson
turning
his
haggard
face
to
me
with
startled
recognition
come
up
at
once
please
without
a
word
to
me
he
disappeared
with
the
landlady
i
could
not
go
away
for
some
ten
minutes
i
fidgeted
about
the
little
room
listening
to
every
sound
in
the
house
then
came
a
footfall
on
the
stairs
and
the
landlady
rejoined
me
nothing
she
said
almost
think
she
might
drop
off
to
sleep
if
she
left
quiet
he
worries
her
poor
man
sitting
there
and
asking
her
every
two
minutes
how
she
feels
i
persuaded
him
to
go
to
his
room
and
i
think
it
might
do
him
good
if
you
went
and
had
a
bit
o
talk
with
him
i
mounted
at
once
to
the
and
found
christopherson
sunk
upon
a
chair
his
head
falling
forwards
the
image
of
despairing
misery
as
i
approached
he
staggered
to
his
feet
he
took
my
hand
in
a
shrinking
shamefaced
way
and
could
not
raise
his
eyes
i
uttered
a
few
words
of
encouragement
but
they
had
the
opposite
effect
to
that
designed
tell
me
that
he
moaned
half
resentfully
dying
dying
say
what
they
will
i
know
it
you
a
good
doctor
think
so
but
it
too
late
it
too
late
as
he
dropped
to
his
chair
again
i
sat
down
by
him
the
silence
of
a
minute
or
two
was
broken
by
a
thunderous
at
the
christopherson
leapt
to
his
feet
rushed
from
the
room
i
half
fearing
that
he
had
gone
mad
followed
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
a
moment
he
came
up
again
limp
and
wretched
as
before
was
the
postman
he
muttered
am
expecting
a
letter
conversation
seeming
impossible
i
shaped
a
phrase
preliminary
to
withdrawal
but
christopherson
would
not
let
me
go
should
like
to
tell
you
he
began
looking
at
me
like
a
dog
under
punishment
i
have
done
all
i
could
as
soon
as
my
wife
fell
ill
and
when
i
saw
i
had
only
begun
to
think
of
it
in
that
way
how
she
felt
the
disappointment
i
went
at
once
to
keeting
house
to
tell
her
that
i
would
sell
the
books
but
she
was
out
of
town
i
wrote
to
her
i
said
i
regretted
my
folly
i
entreated
her
to
forgive
me
and
to
renew
her
kind
offer
there
has
been
plenty
of
time
for
a
reply
but
she
does
answer
he
had
in
his
hand
what
i
saw
was
a
bookseller
catalogue
just
delivered
by
the
postman
mechanically
he
tore
off
the
wrapper
and
even
glanced
over
the
first
page
then
as
if
conscience
stabbed
him
he
flung
the
thing
violently
away
chance
has
gone
he
exclaimed
taking
a
hurried
step
or
two
along
the
little
strip
of
floor
left
free
by
the
mountain
of
books
course
she
said
she
would
rather
stay
in
london
of
course
she
said
what
she
knew
would
please
me
when
when
did
she
ever
say
anything
else
and
i
was
cruel
enough
base
enough
to
let
her
make
the
sacrifice
he
waved
his
arms
frantically
i
know
what
it
cost
her
could
i
see
in
her
face
how
her
heart
leapt
at
the
hope
of
going
to
live
in
the
country
i
knew
what
she
was
suffering
i
it
i
tell
you
and
like
a
selfish
coward
i
let
her
suffer
i
let
her
drop
down
and
die
die
hour
i
said
bring
you
the
reply
from
keeting
of
course
it
will
be
favourable
and
the
good
news
late
i
have
killed
her
that
woman
wo
write
she
one
of
the
vulgar
rich
and
we
offended
her
pride
and
such
as
she
never
forgive
he
sat
down
for
a
moment
but
started
up
again
in
an
agony
of
mental
suffering
is
dying
and
there
there
that
what
has
killed
her
he
gesticulated
wildly
towards
the
books
have
sold
her
life
for
those
oh
oh
with
this
cry
he
seized
half
a
dozen
volumes
and
before
i
could
understand
what
he
was
about
he
had
flung
up
the
and
cast
the
books
into
the
street
another
batch
followed
i
heard
the
thud
upon
the
pavement
then
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
held
him
fast
begged
him
to
control
himself
shall
all
go
he
cried
loathe
the
sight
of
them
they
have
killed
my
dear
wife
he
said
it
sobbing
and
at
the
last
words
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
i
had
no
difficulty
now
in
restraining
him
he
met
my
look
with
a
gaze
of
infinite
pathos
and
talked
on
while
he
wept
you
knew
what
she
has
been
to
me
when
she
married
me
i
was
a
ruined
man
twenty
years
older
i
have
given
her
nothing
but
toil
and
care
you
shall
know
everything
for
years
and
years
i
have
lived
on
the
earnings
of
her
labour
worse
than
that
i
have
starved
and
stinted
her
to
buy
books
oh
the
shame
of
it
the
wickedness
of
it
it
was
my
vice
the
vice
that
enslaved
me
just
as
if
it
had
been
drinking
or
gambling
i
could
resist
the
temptation
though
every
day
i
cried
shame
upon
myself
and
swore
to
overcome
it
she
never
blamed
me
never
a
word
nay
not
a
look
of
a
reproach
i
lived
in
idleness
i
never
tried
to
save
her
that
daily
toil
at
the
shop
do
you
know
that
she
worked
in
a
shop
she
with
her
knowledge
and
her
refinement
leading
such
a
life
as
that
think
that
i
have
passed
the
shop
a
thousand
times
coming
home
with
a
book
in
my
hands
i
had
the
heart
to
pass
and
to
think
of
her
there
oh
oh
some
one
was
knocking
at
the
door
i
went
to
open
and
saw
the
landlady
her
face
set
in
astonishment
and
her
arms
full
of
books
all
right
i
whispered
them
down
on
the
floor
there
bring
them
in
an
accident
christopherson
stood
behind
me
his
look
asked
what
he
durst
not
speak
i
said
it
was
nothing
and
by
degrees
brought
him
into
a
calmer
state
luckily
the
doctor
came
before
i
went
away
and
he
was
able
to
report
a
slight
improvement
the
patient
had
slept
a
little
and
seemed
likely
to
sleep
again
christopherson
asked
me
to
come
again
before
long
there
was
no
one
else
he
said
who
cared
anything
about
him
and
i
promised
to
call
the
next
day
i
did
so
early
in
the
afternoon
christopherson
must
have
watched
for
my
coming
before
i
could
raise
the
knocker
the
door
flew
open
and
his
face
gleamed
such
a
greeting
as
astonished
me
he
grasped
my
hand
in
both
his
letter
has
come
we
are
to
have
the
house
how
is
mrs
christopherson
much
better
heaven
be
thanked
she
slept
almost
from
the
time
when
you
left
yesterday
afternoon
till
early
this
morning
the
letter
came
by
the
first
post
and
i
told
her
not
the
whole
truth
he
added
under
his
breath
thinks
i
am
to
be
allowed
to
take
the
books
with
me
and
if
you
could
have
seen
her
smile
of
contentment
but
they
will
all
be
sold
and
carried
away
before
she
knows
about
it
and
when
she
sees
that
i
care
a
snap
of
the
fingers
he
had
turned
into
the
on
the
ground
floor
walking
about
excitedly
christopherson
gloried
in
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
already
a
letter
was
despatched
to
a
bookseller
who
would
buy
the
whole
library
as
it
stood
but
would
he
not
keep
a
few
volumes
i
asked
surely
there
could
be
no
objection
to
a
few
shelves
of
books
and
how
would
he
live
without
them
at
first
he
declared
vehemently
that
not
a
volume
should
be
kept
he
never
wished
to
see
a
book
again
as
long
as
he
lived
but
christopherson
i
urged
would
she
not
be
glad
of
something
to
read
now
and
then
at
this
he
grew
pensive
we
discussed
the
matter
and
it
was
arranged
that
a
box
should
be
packed
with
select
volumes
and
taken
down
into
norfolk
together
with
the
rest
of
their
luggage
not
even
keeting
could
object
to
this
and
i
strongly
advised
him
to
take
her
permission
for
granted
and
so
it
was
done
by
discreet
management
the
piled
volumes
were
stowed
in
bags
carried
downstairs
emptied
into
a
cart
and
conveyed
away
so
quietly
that
the
sick
woman
was
aware
of
nothing
in
telling
me
about
it
christopherson
crowed
as
i
had
never
heard
him
but
methought
his
eye
avoided
that
part
of
the
floor
which
had
formerly
been
hidden
and
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
he
now
and
then
became
absent
with
head
bowed
of
the
joy
he
felt
in
his
wife
recovery
there
could
however
be
no
doubt
the
crisis
through
which
he
had
passed
had
made
him
in
appearance
a
yet
older
man
when
he
declared
his
happiness
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
his
head
shook
with
a
senile
tremor
before
they
left
london
i
saw
christopherson
a
pale
thin
slightly
made
woman
who
had
never
been
what
is
called
but
her
face
if
ever
face
did
so
declared
a
brave
and
loyal
spirit
she
was
not
joyous
she
was
not
sad
but
in
her
eyes
as
i
looked
at
them
again
and
again
i
read
the
profound
thankfulness
of
one
to
whom
fate
has
granted
her
desire
humplebee
the
school
was
assembled
for
evening
prayers
some
threescore
boys
representing
for
the
most
part
the
middle
class
of
a
manufacturing
county
at
either
end
of
the
room
glowed
a
pleasant
fire
for
it
was
february
and
the
weather
had
turned
to
frost
silence
reigned
but
on
all
the
young
faces
turned
to
where
the
headmaster
sat
at
his
desk
appeared
an
unwonted
expression
an
eager
expectancy
as
though
something
out
of
the
familiar
routine
were
about
to
happen
when
the
master
voice
at
length
sounded
he
did
not
read
from
the
book
before
him
gravely
slowly
he
began
to
speak
of
an
event
which
had
that
day
stirred
the
little
community
with
profound
emotion
of
our
number
are
this
evening
absent
happily
most
happily
absent
but
for
a
short
time
in
our
prayers
we
shall
render
thanks
to
the
good
providence
which
has
saved
us
from
a
terrible
calamity
i
do
not
desire
to
dwell
upon
the
circumstance
that
one
of
these
boys
chadwick
had
committed
worse
than
an
imprudence
in
venturing
upon
the
long
pond
it
was
in
disregard
of
my
injunction
i
had
distinctly
made
it
known
that
the
ice
was
still
unsafe
we
will
speak
no
more
of
that
all
we
can
think
of
at
present
is
the
fact
that
chadwick
was
on
the
point
of
losing
his
life
that
in
all
human
probability
he
would
have
been
drowned
but
for
the
help
heroically
afforded
him
by
one
of
his
schoolfellows
i
say
heroically
and
i
am
sure
i
do
not
exaggerate
in
the
absence
of
humplebee
i
may
declare
that
he
nobly
perilled
his
own
life
to
save
that
of
another
it
was
a
splendid
bit
of
courage
a
fine
example
of
pluck
and
promptitude
and
vigour
we
have
all
cause
this
night
to
be
proud
of
humplebee
the
solemn
voice
paused
there
was
an
instant
profound
silence
then
from
somewhere
amid
the
rows
of
listeners
sounded
a
clear
boyish
note
may
we
give
three
cheers
for
humplebee
may
the
threescore
leapt
to
their
feet
and
volleys
of
cheering
made
the
schoolroom
echo
then
the
master
raised
his
hand
the
tumult
subsided
and
after
a
few
moments
of
agitated
silence
prayers
began
next
morning
there
appeared
as
usual
at
his
desk
a
short
thin
boy
of
sixteen
whose
plain
freckled
face
denoted
and
a
certain
intelligence
but
would
never
have
drawn
attention
amongst
the
livelier
and
comelier
physiognomies
grouped
about
him
this
was
humplebee
hitherto
he
had
been
an
insignificant
member
of
the
school
one
of
those
boys
who
excel
neither
at
games
nor
at
lessons
of
whom
nothing
is
expected
and
rarely
if
ever
get
into
trouble
and
who
are
liked
in
a
rather
contemptuous
way
of
a
sudden
he
shone
glorious
all
tongues
were
busy
with
him
all
eyes
regarded
him
every
one
wished
for
the
honour
of
his
friendship
humplebee
looked
uncomfortable
he
had
the
sniffy
beginnings
of
a
cold
the
result
of
yesterday
struggle
in
icy
water
and
his
usual
diffident
and
monosyllabic
inclination
were
intensified
by
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
clappings
on
the
shoulder
from
bigger
boys
who
had
been
wont
to
joke
about
his
name
made
him
flush
nervously
to
be
addressed
as
or
or
even
though
in
a
new
tone
seemed
to
gratify
him
as
little
as
before
it
was
plain
that
humplebee
would
much
have
liked
to
be
left
alone
he
stuck
as
closely
as
possible
to
his
desk
and
out
of
tried
to
steal
apart
from
the
throng
but
an
ordeal
awaited
him
early
in
the
afternoon
there
arrived
from
a
great
town
not
far
away
a
and
man
whose
every
look
and
accent
declared
commercial
importance
this
was
chadwick
father
of
the
boy
who
had
all
but
been
drowned
he
and
the
headmaster
held
private
talk
and
presently
they
sent
for
humplebee
merely
to
enter
the
was
at
any
time
humplebee
dread
to
do
so
under
the
present
circumstances
cost
him
anguish
of
spirit
here
he
is
exclaimed
chadwick
in
the
voice
of
bluff
geniality
which
seemed
to
him
appropriate
let
me
shake
hands
with
you
humplebee
i
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
prouder
still
to
thank
you
to
thank
you
my
boy
the
lad
was
painfully
overcome
his
hands
quivered
he
stood
like
one
convicted
of
disgraceful
behaviour
think
you
have
heard
of
me
humplebee
leonard
has
no
doubt
spoken
to
you
of
his
father
perhaps
my
name
has
reached
you
in
other
ways
sir
faltered
the
boy
mean
that
you
know
me
as
a
public
man
urged
chadwick
whose
eyes
glimmered
a
hungry
vanity
sir
whispered
humplebee
i
see
you
already
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
things
beyond
school
they
tell
me
you
are
sixteen
humplebee
come
now
what
are
your
ideas
about
the
future
i
do
mean
chadwick
rolled
a
laugh
the
future
of
mankind
or
even
the
future
of
the
english
race
you
and
i
may
perhaps
discuss
such
questions
a
few
years
hence
in
the
meantime
what
are
your
personal
ambitions
in
brief
what
would
you
like
to
be
humplebee
under
the
eye
of
his
master
and
of
the
commercial
potentate
humplebee
stood
voiceless
he
gasped
once
or
twice
like
an
expiring
fish
my
boy
courage
cried
chadwick
father
i
believe
destines
you
for
commerce
is
that
your
own
wish
speak
freely
speak
as
though
i
were
a
friend
you
have
known
all
your
life
should
like
to
please
my
father
sir
jerked
from
the
boy
lips
admirable
that
the
spirit
i
like
humplebee
then
you
have
no
marked
predilection
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
discover
well
well
we
shall
see
meanwhile
humplebee
get
on
with
your
arithmetic
you
are
good
at
arithmetic
i
am
sure
very
sir
come
that
your
modesty
but
i
like
you
none
the
worse
for
it
humplebee
well
well
get
on
with
your
work
my
boy
and
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
therewith
to
his
vast
relief
humplebee
found
himself
dismissed
later
in
the
day
he
received
a
summons
to
the
bedroom
where
chadwick
son
was
being
carefully
nursed
leonard
chadwick
about
the
same
age
as
his
rescuer
had
never
deigned
to
pay
much
attention
to
humplebee
whom
he
regarded
as
stupid
and
plebeian
but
the
boy
character
was
marked
by
a
generous
impulsiveness
which
came
out
strongly
in
the
present
circumstances
humpy
he
cried
raising
himself
up
when
the
other
entered
you
pulled
me
out
of
that
hole
shake
hands
buzzy
old
fellow
you
had
a
talk
with
my
governor
have
you
what
do
you
think
of
him
humplebee
muttered
something
incoherent
governor
going
to
make
your
fortune
humpy
cried
leonard
told
me
so
and
when
he
says
a
thing
he
means
it
he
going
to
start
you
in
business
when
you
leave
school
most
likely
you
go
into
his
own
office
how
will
you
like
that
humpy
my
governor
thinks
no
end
of
you
says
you
a
brick
and
so
you
are
i
sha
forget
that
you
pulled
me
out
of
that
hole
old
chap
we
shall
be
friends
all
our
lives
you
know
tell
me
what
you
thought
of
my
governor
when
he
was
on
his
legs
again
leonard
continued
to
treat
humplebee
with
grateful
if
somewhat
condescending
friendliness
in
the
talks
they
had
together
the
great
man
son
continually
expatiated
upon
his
brilliant
prospects
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
humplebee
would
some
day
be
a
rich
man
chadwick
had
said
so
and
whatever
he
purposed
came
to
pass
to
all
this
humplebee
listened
in
a
dogged
sort
of
way
now
and
then
smiling
but
seldom
making
verbal
answer
in
school
he
was
not
quite
the
same
boy
as
before
his
exploit
he
seemed
duller
less
attentive
and
at
times
even
incurred
reproaches
for
work
ill
done
previously
a
thing
unknown
when
the
holidays
came
no
boy
was
so
glad
as
humplebee
his
heart
sang
within
him
as
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
school
and
began
the
journey
homeward
that
home
was
in
the
town
illuminated
by
chadwick
commercial
and
municipal
brilliance
over
a
small
draper
shop
in
one
of
the
outskirt
streets
stood
the
name
of
humplebee
the
draper
about
sixty
years
of
age
he
had
known
plenty
of
misfortune
and
sorrows
with
scant
admixture
of
happiness
nowadays
things
were
somewhat
better
with
him
by
dint
of
severe
economy
he
had
put
aside
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
and
he
was
able
moreover
to
give
his
son
an
only
child
what
is
called
a
sound
education
in
the
limited
rooms
above
the
shop
there
might
have
been
a
measure
of
quiet
content
and
hopefulness
but
for
humplebee
she
considerably
younger
than
her
husband
fretted
against
their
narrow
circumstances
and
grudged
the
money
that
was
being
spent
wasted
she
called
it
on
the
boy
harry
from
his
father
harry
never
heard
talk
of
pecuniary
troubles
but
the
mother
lost
no
opportunity
of
letting
him
know
that
they
were
poor
miserably
poor
and
adding
that
if
he
did
not
work
hard
at
school
he
was
simply
a
criminal
and
robbed
his
parents
of
their
bread
but
during
the
last
month
or
two
a
change
had
come
upon
the
household
one
day
the
draper
received
a
visit
from
the
great
chadwick
who
told
a
wonderful
story
of
harry
heroism
and
made
proposals
sounding
so
nobly
generous
that
humplebee
was
overcome
with
gratitude
harry
as
his
father
knew
had
no
vocation
for
the
shop
to
get
him
a
place
in
a
manufacturer
office
seemed
the
best
thing
that
could
be
aimed
at
and
here
was
chadwick
talking
of
easy
quick
advancement
and
all
manner
of
vaguely
splendid
possibilities
in
the
future
the
draper
joy
proved
humplebee
opportunity
she
put
forward
a
project
which
had
of
late
been
constantly
on
her
mind
and
on
her
lips
to
wit
that
they
should
transfer
their
business
into
larger
premises
and
give
themselves
a
chance
of
prosperity
humplebee
need
no
longer
hesitate
he
had
his
little
capital
to
meet
the
first
expenses
and
if
need
arose
there
need
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
that
chadwick
would
assist
him
a
kind
gentleman
chadwick
had
he
not
expressly
desired
to
see
harry
mother
and
had
he
not
assured
her
in
every
way
possible
of
his
debt
and
gratitude
he
felt
towards
all
who
bore
the
name
of
humplebee
the
draper
if
he
neglected
his
opportunity
would
be
an
idiot
a
mere
idiot
so
when
the
boy
came
home
for
his
holidays
he
found
two
momentous
things
decided
first
that
he
should
forthwith
enter
chadwick
office
secondly
that
the
little
shop
should
be
abandoned
and
a
new
one
taken
in
a
better
neighbourhood
now
harry
humplebee
had
in
his
soul
a
secret
desire
and
a
secret
abhorrence
ever
since
he
could
read
his
delight
had
been
in
books
of
natural
history
beasts
birds
and
fishes
possessed
his
imagination
and
for
nothing
else
in
the
intellectual
world
did
he
really
care
with
poor
resources
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
of
his
beloved
subjects
whenever
he
could
get
away
into
the
fields
he
was
happy
to
lie
still
for
hours
watching
some
wild
thing
noting
its
features
and
its
ways
seemed
to
him
perfect
enjoyment
his
treasure
was
a
collection
locked
in
a
cupboard
at
home
of
eggs
skeletons
butterflies
beetles
and
i
know
not
what
his
father
regarded
all
this
as
harmless
amusement
his
mother
contemptuously
tolerated
it
or
in
worse
humour
condemned
it
as
waste
of
time
when
at
school
the
boy
had
frequent
opportunities
of
pursuing
his
study
for
he
was
in
mid
country
and
could
wander
as
he
liked
on
free
afternoons
but
neither
the
headmaster
nor
his
assistant
thought
it
worth
while
to
pay
heed
to
humplebee
predilection
true
it
had
been
noticed
more
than
once
that
in
writing
an
he
showed
unusual
observation
of
natural
things
this
however
did
not
strike
his
educators
as
a
matter
of
any
importance
it
was
not
their
business
to
discover
what
humplebee
could
do
and
wished
to
do
but
to
make
him
do
things
they
regarded
as
desirable
humplebee
was
marked
for
commerce
he
must
study
compound
interest
and
be
strong
at
discount
yet
the
boy
loathed
every
such
mental
effort
and
the
name
of
made
him
sick
at
heart
how
he
longed
to
unbosom
himself
to
his
father
and
in
the
first
week
of
his
holiday
he
had
a
chance
of
doing
so
a
wonderful
chance
such
as
had
never
entered
his
dreams
the
town
possessed
a
museum
of
natural
history
where
of
course
harry
had
often
spent
leisure
hours
half
a
year
ago
a
happy
chance
had
brought
him
into
conversation
with
the
curator
who
could
not
but
be
struck
by
the
lad
intelligence
and
who
took
an
interest
in
him
now
they
met
again
they
had
one
or
two
long
talks
with
the
result
that
on
a
sunday
afternoon
the
curator
of
the
museum
took
the
trouble
to
call
upon
humplebee
to
speak
with
him
about
his
son
at
the
museum
was
wanted
a
lad
with
a
taste
for
natural
history
to
perform
at
first
certain
easy
duties
with
the
prospect
of
further
advancement
here
or
elsewhere
it
seemed
to
the
curator
that
harry
was
the
very
boy
for
the
place
would
humplebee
like
to
consider
this
suggestion
now
if
it
had
been
made
to
him
half
a
year
ago
such
an
offer
would
have
seemed
to
humplebee
well
worth
consideration
and
he
knew
that
harry
would
have
heard
of
it
with
delight
as
it
was
he
could
not
entertain
the
thought
for
a
moment
impossible
to
run
the
risk
of
offending
chadwick
moreover
who
could
hesitate
between
the
modest
possibilities
of
the
museum
and
such
a
career
as
waited
the
lad
under
the
protection
of
his
powerful
friend
with
nervous
haste
the
draper
explained
how
matters
stood
excused
himself
and
begged
that
not
another
word
on
the
subject
might
be
spoken
in
his
son
hearing
harry
humplebee
knew
what
he
had
lost
the
curator
in
talk
with
him
had
already
thrown
out
his
suggestion
at
their
next
meeting
he
discreetly
made
known
to
the
boy
that
other
counsels
must
prevail
for
the
first
time
harry
felt
a
vehement
impulse
prompting
him
to
speak
on
his
own
behalf
to
assert
and
to
plead
for
his
own
desires
but
courage
failed
him
he
heard
his
father
loud
in
praise
of
chadwick
intent
upon
the
gratitude
and
respect
due
to
that
admirable
man
he
knew
how
his
mother
would
exclaim
at
the
mere
hint
of
disinclination
to
enter
the
great
man
office
and
so
he
held
his
peace
though
it
cost
him
bitterness
of
heart
and
even
secret
tears
a
long
long
time
passed
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
enter
again
the
museum
doors
he
sat
on
a
stool
in
chadwick
office
a
clerk
at
a
trifling
salary
everything
his
father
reminded
him
must
have
a
beginning
let
him
work
well
and
his
progress
would
be
rapid
two
years
passed
and
he
was
in
much
the
same
position
his
salary
had
increased
by
one
half
but
his
work
remained
the
same
mechanical
dreary
hateful
to
him
in
its
monotony
meanwhile
his
father
venture
in
the
new
premises
had
led
to
great
embarrassments
business
did
not
thrive
the
day
came
when
humplebee
trembling
and
shamefaced
felt
himself
drawn
to
beg
help
of
his
benefactor
he
came
away
from
the
interview
with
empty
hands
worse
than
that
he
had
heard
things
about
harry
which
darkened
his
mind
with
a
new
anxiety
greatly
fear
said
chadwick
your
son
must
seek
a
place
in
some
other
office
it
a
painful
thing
i
wish
i
could
have
kept
him
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
shows
utter
incapacity
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
him
otherwise
a
good
lad
in
a
smaller
place
of
business
he
might
do
well
enough
but
he
altogether
below
the
mark
in
an
office
such
as
do
distress
yourself
humplebee
i
beg
i
shall
make
it
my
care
to
inquire
for
suitable
openings
you
shall
hear
from
me
you
shall
hear
from
me
pray
consider
that
your
son
is
under
notice
to
leave
this
day
month
as
for
the
other
matter
of
which
you
spoke
i
can
only
repeat
that
the
truest
kindness
is
only
to
refuse
assistance
i
assure
you
it
is
the
circumstances
forbid
it
clearly
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
call
together
your
creditors
and
arrive
at
an
understanding
it
is
my
principle
never
to
try
to
prop
up
a
hopeless
concern
such
as
yours
evidently
is
good
day
to
you
humplebee
good
day
a
year
later
several
things
had
happened
humplebee
was
dead
his
penniless
widow
had
gone
to
live
in
another
town
on
the
charity
of
poor
relatives
and
harry
humplebee
sat
in
another
office
drawing
the
salary
at
which
he
had
begun
under
chadwick
his
home
a
wretched
bedroom
in
the
house
of
it
did
not
appear
to
the
lad
that
he
had
suffered
any
injustice
he
knew
his
own
inaptitude
for
the
higher
kind
of
office
work
and
he
had
expected
his
dismissal
by
chadwick
long
before
it
came
what
he
did
resent
and
profoundly
was
chadwick
refusal
to
aid
his
father
in
that
last
with
ruinous
circumstance
at
the
worst
moment
harry
wrote
a
letter
to
leonard
chadwick
whom
he
had
never
seen
since
he
left
school
he
told
in
simple
terms
the
position
of
his
family
and
without
a
word
of
justifying
reminiscence
asked
his
schoolfellow
to
help
them
if
he
could
to
this
letter
a
reply
came
from
london
leonard
chadwick
wrote
briefly
and
hurriedly
but
in
terms
he
was
really
very
sorry
indeed
that
he
could
do
so
little
the
fact
was
just
now
he
stood
on
anything
but
good
terms
with
his
father
who
kept
him
abominably
short
of
cash
he
enclosed
five
pounds
and
if
possible
would
soon
send
more
suppose
i
have
forgotten
what
i
owe
you
as
soon
as
ever
i
find
myself
in
an
independent
position
you
shall
have
substantial
proof
of
my
enduring
gratitude
keep
me
informed
of
your
address
humplebee
made
no
second
application
and
leonard
chadwick
did
not
again
break
silence
the
years
flowed
on
at
humplebee
toiled
in
the
same
office
but
he
could
congratulate
himself
on
a
certain
progress
by
dogged
resolve
he
had
acquired
something
like
efficiency
in
the
duties
of
a
commercial
clerk
and
the
salary
he
now
earned
allowed
him
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
his
mother
more
or
less
reconciled
to
the
day
labour
he
had
resumed
in
leisure
hours
his
favourite
study
a
free
library
supplied
him
with
useful
books
and
whenever
it
was
possible
he
went
his
way
into
the
fields
searching
collecting
observing
but
his
life
had
another
interest
which
threatened
rivalry
to
this
intellectual
pursuit
humplebee
had
set
eyes
upon
the
maiden
destined
to
be
his
heart
desire
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
a
man
who
had
grown
grey
in
service
of
the
ledger
timidly
he
sought
to
win
her
kindness
as
yet
scarce
daring
to
hope
dreaming
only
of
some
happy
change
of
position
which
might
encourage
him
to
speak
the
girl
was
as
timid
as
himself
she
had
a
face
of
homely
prettiness
a
mind
uncultured
but
sympathetic
absorbed
in
domestic
cares
with
few
acquaintances
she
led
the
simplest
of
lives
and
would
have
been
all
but
content
to
live
on
in
gentle
hope
for
a
score
of
years
the
two
were
beginning
to
understand
each
other
for
their
silence
was
more
eloquent
than
their
speech
one
summer
day
the
last
day
of
his
brief
holiday
humplebee
was
returning
by
train
from
a
visit
to
his
mother
alone
in
a
carriage
seeming
to
read
a
newspaper
but
in
truth
dreaming
of
a
face
he
hoped
to
see
in
a
few
hours
he
suddenly
found
himself
jerked
out
of
his
seat
flung
violently
forward
bumped
on
the
floor
and
last
of
all
rolled
into
a
sort
of
bundle
he
knew
not
where
recovering
from
a
daze
he
said
to
himself
this
is
an
accident
a
collision
then
he
tried
to
unroll
himself
and
in
the
effort
found
that
one
of
his
arms
was
useless
more
than
that
it
pained
him
horribly
he
stood
up
and
tottered
on
to
the
seat
then
the
opened
and
a
voice
shouted
hurt
here
think
my
arm
is
broken
answered
humplebee
two
men
helped
him
to
alight
the
train
had
stopped
just
outside
a
small
station
on
a
cross
line
in
front
of
the
engine
lay
a
goods
truck
smashed
to
pieces
people
were
rushing
about
with
cries
and
gesticulations
the
arm
is
broken
remarked
one
of
the
men
who
had
assisted
humplebee
looks
as
if
you
were
the
only
passenger
injured
that
proved
indeed
to
be
the
case
no
one
else
had
suffered
more
than
a
jolt
or
a
bruise
the
crowd
clustered
about
this
hero
of
the
broken
arm
expressing
sympathy
and
offering
suggestions
among
them
was
a
young
man
rather
and
of
lively
demeanour
who
seemed
to
enjoy
the
excitement
he
after
gazing
fixedly
at
the
face
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
wonder
jove
it
humplebee
the
sufferer
turned
towards
him
who
spoke
his
eyes
brightened
for
he
recognised
the
face
of
leonard
chadwick
neither
one
nor
the
other
had
greatly
altered
during
the
past
ten
years
they
presented
exactly
the
same
contrast
of
personal
characteristic
as
when
they
were
at
school
together
with
vehement
friendliness
chadwick
at
once
took
upon
himself
the
care
of
the
injured
clerk
he
shouted
for
a
cab
he
found
out
where
the
nearest
doctor
lived
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
his
friend
under
the
roof
when
the
fracture
had
been
set
and
bandaged
they
travelled
on
together
to
their
native
town
only
a
few
miles
distant
humplebee
knowing
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
luxury
of
a
compartment
on
their
way
chadwick
talked
exuberantly
he
was
delighted
at
this
meeting
why
one
of
his
purposes
in
coming
north
had
been
to
search
out
humplebee
whom
he
had
so
long
scandalously
neglected
fact
is
i
been
going
through
queer
times
myself
the
governor
and
i
ca
get
along
together
we
quarrelled
years
ago
there
not
much
chance
of
our
making
it
up
i
no
doubt
that
was
the
real
reason
of
his
dismissing
you
from
his
office
a
mean
thing
the
governor
a
fine
old
boy
but
he
has
his
nasty
side
he
very
tight
about
money
and
i
well
i
a
bit
too
much
the
other
way
no
doubt
he
kept
me
in
low
water
confound
him
but
i
independent
of
him
now
i
tell
you
all
about
it
you
feel
better
able
to
talk
expect
me
at
eleven
in
the
morning
through
a
night
of
physical
suffering
humplebee
was
supported
by
a
new
hope
chadwick
the
son
and
generous
made
a
strong
contrast
with
chadwick
the
father
pompous
and
insincere
when
the
young
man
spoke
of
his
abiding
gratitude
there
was
no
possibility
of
distrusting
him
his
voice
rang
true
and
his
handsome
features
wore
a
delightful
frankness
punctual
to
his
appointment
leonard
appeared
next
morning
he
entered
the
poor
lodging
as
if
it
had
been
a
luxurious
residence
talked
suavely
and
gaily
with
the
landlady
who
was
tending
her
invalid
and
when
alone
with
his
old
schoolfellow
launched
into
a
detailed
account
of
a
great
enterprise
in
which
he
was
concerned
not
long
ago
he
had
become
acquainted
with
one
geldershaw
a
man
somewhat
older
than
himself
personally
most
attractive
and
very
keen
in
business
geldershaw
had
just
been
appointed
london
representative
of
a
great
manufacturing
firm
in
germany
it
was
a
most
profitable
undertaking
and
out
of
pure
friendship
he
had
offered
a
share
in
the
business
to
leonard
chadwick
course
i
put
money
into
it
the
fact
is
i
have
dropped
in
for
a
few
thousands
from
a
good
old
aunt
who
has
been
awfully
kind
to
me
since
the
governor
and
i
fell
out
i
could
possibly
have
found
a
better
investment
it
means
eight
or
nine
per
cent
my
boy
at
the
very
least
and
look
here
humplebee
of
course
you
can
keep
books
i
can
answered
the
listener
conscientiously
old
fellow
a
place
is
open
to
you
we
want
some
one
we
can
thoroughly
trust
you
the
very
man
geldershaw
had
in
his
eye
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
screw
you
get
at
present
pounds
ten
a
week
ha
laughed
chadwick
exultantly
us
you
shall
begin
at
double
the
figure
and
i
see
to
it
that
you
have
a
rise
after
the
first
year
what
more
humplebee
as
soon
as
we
get
fairly
going
i
promise
you
a
share
in
the
business
do
say
a
word
old
boy
my
governor
treated
you
abominably
i
been
in
your
debt
for
ten
years
or
so
as
you
know
very
well
and
often
enough
i
felt
deucedly
ashamed
of
myself
five
pounds
a
week
to
begin
with
and
a
certainty
of
a
comfortable
interest
in
a
thriving
affair
come
now
is
it
agreed
humplebee
forgot
his
pain
he
felt
ready
to
jump
out
of
bed
and
travel
straightway
to
london
you
know
pursued
chadwick
when
they
had
shaken
hands
warmly
you
have
a
claim
for
damages
on
the
railway
company
leave
that
to
me
put
the
thing
in
train
at
once
through
my
own
solicitor
you
shall
pocket
a
substantial
sum
my
boy
well
i
afraid
i
must
be
off
i
got
my
hands
full
of
business
quite
a
new
thing
for
me
to
have
something
serious
to
do
i
enjoy
it
if
i
ca
see
you
again
before
i
go
back
to
town
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
a
day
or
two
here
my
london
address
chuck
up
your
place
here
at
once
so
as
to
be
ready
for
us
as
soon
as
your
arm
all
right
geldershaw
shall
write
you
a
formal
engagement
happily
his
broken
arm
was
the
left
humplebee
could
use
his
right
hand
and
did
so
very
soon
after
chadwick
departure
to
send
an
account
of
all
that
had
befallen
him
to
his
friend
mary
bowes
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
written
to
her
his
letter
was
couched
in
terms
of
studious
respect
with
many
apologies
for
the
liberty
he
took
of
the
accident
he
made
light
a
few
days
would
see
him
but
he
dwelt
with
some
emphasis
upon
the
meeting
with
leonard
chadwick
and
what
had
resulted
from
it
did
him
a
good
turn
once
when
we
were
at
school
together
he
is
a
good
fellow
and
has
sought
this
opportunity
of
showing
that
he
remembered
the
old
time
thus
did
humplebee
refer
to
the
great
event
of
his
boyhood
having
despatched
the
letter
he
waited
feverishly
for
miss
bowes
reply
but
days
passed
and
still
he
waited
in
vain
agitation
delayed
his
recovery
he
was
suffering
as
he
had
never
suffered
in
his
life
when
there
came
a
letter
from
london
signed
with
the
name
of
geldershaw
repeating
in
formal
terms
the
offer
made
to
him
by
leonard
chadwick
and
requesting
his
immediate
acceptance
or
refusal
this
plucked
him
out
of
his
despondent
state
and
spurred
him
to
action
with
the
help
of
his
landlady
he
dressed
himself
and
having
concealed
his
bandaged
arm
as
well
as
possible
drove
in
a
cab
to
miss
bowes
dwelling
the
hour
being
before
noon
he
was
almost
sure
to
find
mary
at
home
and
alone
trembling
with
bodily
weakness
and
the
conflict
of
emotions
he
rang
the
door
bell
to
his
consternation
there
appeared
mary
father
humplebee
cried
bowes
surprised
but
friendly
i
was
just
going
to
write
to
you
mary
has
had
scarlet
fever
i
been
so
busy
these
last
ten
days
i
could
even
inquire
after
you
of
course
i
saw
about
your
smash
in
the
newspaper
how
are
you
getting
on
the
man
with
the
bandaged
arm
could
not
utter
a
word
he
stared
at
bowes
who
had
begun
to
express
a
doubt
whether
it
would
be
prudent
for
him
to
enter
the
house
mary
is
convalescent
the
anxiety
all
over
but
humplebee
suddenly
seized
the
speaker
hand
and
in
confused
words
expressed
vehement
joy
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
parted
with
cordiality
and
humplebee
went
home
again
to
recover
from
his
excitement
a
note
from
his
employers
had
replied
in
terms
of
decent
condolence
to
the
message
by
which
he
explained
his
enforced
absence
he
wrote
to
the
principal
announcing
his
intention
of
resigning
his
post
in
their
office
the
response
delivered
within
a
few
hours
was
admirably
brief
and
to
the
point
humplebee
place
had
of
course
been
already
taken
temporarily
by
another
clerk
it
would
have
been
held
open
for
him
but
in
view
of
his
decision
the
firm
had
merely
to
request
that
he
would
acknowledge
the
cheque
enclosed
in
payment
of
his
salary
up
to
date
not
without
some
shaking
of
the
hand
did
humplebee
pen
this
receipt
for
a
moment
something
seemed
to
come
between
him
and
the
daylight
and
a
heaviness
oppressed
his
inner
man
but
already
he
had
despatched
to
london
his
formal
acceptance
of
the
post
at
five
pounds
a
week
and
in
thinking
of
it
his
heart
grew
joyous
two
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
a
year
it
was
beyond
the
hope
of
his
most
fantastic
he
was
a
made
man
secure
for
ever
against
fears
and
worries
he
was
a
man
of
substance
and
need
no
longer
shrink
from
making
known
the
hope
which
ruled
his
life
a
second
letter
was
written
to
mary
bowes
but
not
till
many
copies
had
been
made
was
it
at
length
despatched
the
writer
declared
that
he
looked
for
no
reply
until
mary
was
quite
herself
again
he
begged
only
that
she
would
reflect
meanwhile
upon
what
he
had
said
reflect
with
all
her
indulgence
all
her
native
goodness
and
gentleness
and
indeed
there
elapsed
nearly
a
fortnight
before
the
answer
came
and
to
humplebee
it
seemed
an
endless
succession
of
tormenting
days
then
humplebee
behaved
like
one
distracted
his
landlady
in
good
earnest
thought
he
had
gone
crazy
and
was
only
reassured
when
he
revealed
to
her
what
had
happened
mary
bowes
was
to
be
his
wife
they
must
wait
for
a
year
and
a
half
mary
could
not
leave
her
father
quite
alone
but
in
a
year
and
a
half
bowes
who
was
an
oldish
man
would
be
able
to
retire
on
the
modest
fruit
of
his
economies
and
all
three
could
live
together
in
london
cried
humplebee
eighteen
months
it
would
allow
him
to
save
enough
out
of
his
noble
salary
to
start
housekeeping
with
something
more
than
comfort
blessed
be
the
name
of
chadwick
when
his
arm
was
once
more
sound
and
mary
health
quite
recovered
they
met
in
their
long
long
talk
humplebee
was
led
to
tell
the
story
of
that
winter
day
when
he
saved
leonard
chadwick
life
he
related
too
all
that
had
ensued
upon
his
acquaintance
with
the
great
chadwick
memories
which
would
never
lose
all
their
bitterness
mary
was
moved
to
tears
and
her
tears
were
dried
by
indignation
but
they
agreed
that
leonard
after
all
made
some
atonement
for
his
father
heartless
behaviour
humplebee
showed
a
letter
that
had
come
from
young
chadwick
a
day
or
two
ago
every
line
spoke
generosity
of
spirit
he
asked
they
expect
their
new
bookkeeper
they
were
in
full
swing
business
promised
magnificently
as
yet
they
had
only
a
temporary
office
but
geldershaw
was
in
treaty
for
fine
premises
in
the
city
the
sooner
humplebee
arrived
the
better
fortune
awaited
him
it
was
decided
that
he
should
leave
for
london
in
two
days
the
next
evening
he
came
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
mary
and
her
father
on
entering
the
room
he
at
once
observed
something
strange
in
the
looks
with
which
he
was
greeted
mary
had
a
pale
miserable
air
and
could
hardly
speak
bowes
after
looking
at
him
fixedly
for
a
moment
exclaimed
you
seen
paper
been
too
busy
he
replied
has
happened
your
london
man
called
geldershaw
murmured
humplebee
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
the
police
are
after
him
he
has
bolted
it
a
swindle
that
he
been
up
to
you
know
what
that
means
obtaining
goods
on
false
credit
and
raising
money
on
them
what
more
young
chadwick
is
arrested
he
came
before
the
magistrates
yesterday
charged
with
being
an
accomplice
here
it
is
read
it
for
yourself
humplebee
dropped
into
a
chair
when
his
eyes
undazzled
he
read
the
full
report
which
bowes
had
summarised
it
was
the
of
his
hopes
chadwick
has
been
a
victim
not
a
swindler
sounded
from
him
in
a
feeble
voice
see
he
says
that
geldershaw
has
robbed
him
of
all
his
money
that
he
is
ruined
so
remarked
bowes
with
angry
irony
believe
him
said
humplebee
his
eyes
sought
mary
the
girl
regarded
him
steadily
and
she
spoke
in
a
low
firm
voice
too
believe
him
or
no
said
bowes
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
upshot
of
it
is
humplebee
that
you
lost
a
good
place
through
trusting
him
i
had
my
doubts
but
you
were
in
a
hurry
and
did
ask
advice
if
this
had
happened
a
week
later
the
police
would
have
laid
hands
on
you
as
well
there
something
to
be
thankful
for
at
all
events
said
mary
again
humplebee
met
her
eyes
he
saw
that
she
would
not
forsake
him
he
had
to
begin
life
over
again
that
was
all
the
scrupulous
father
it
was
market
day
in
the
little
town
at
one
a
rustic
company
besieged
the
table
of
the
greyhound
lured
by
savoury
odours
and
the
frothing
of
amber
ale
apart
from
three
frequenters
of
the
ordinary
in
a
small
room
prepared
for
overflow
sat
two
persons
of
a
different
stamp
a
man
bald
meagre
unimpressive
but
wholly
respectable
in
bearing
and
apparel
and
a
girl
evidently
his
daughter
who
had
the
look
of
the
latter
twenties
her
plain
dress
harmonising
with
a
subdued
charm
of
feature
and
a
timidity
of
manner
not
ungraceful
whilst
waiting
for
their
meal
they
conversed
in
an
undertone
their
brief
remarks
and
ejaculations
told
of
a
long
morning
ramble
from
the
seaside
resort
some
miles
away
in
their
quiet
fashion
they
seemed
to
have
enjoyed
themselves
and
dinner
at
an
inn
evidently
struck
them
as
something
of
an
escapade
rather
awkwardly
the
girl
arranged
a
handful
of
wild
flowers
which
she
had
gathered
and
put
them
for
refreshment
into
a
tumbler
of
water
when
a
woman
entered
with
viands
silence
fell
upon
the
two
after
hesitations
and
mutual
glances
they
began
to
eat
with
nervous
appetite
scarcely
was
their
modest
confidence
restored
when
in
the
doorway
sounded
a
virile
voice
gaily
humming
and
they
became
aware
of
a
tall
young
man
anything
but
handsome
flushed
and
perspiring
from
the
sunny
road
his
open
jacket
showed
a
blue
cotton
shirt
without
waistcoat
in
his
hand
was
a
shabby
straw
hat
and
thick
dust
covered
his
boots
one
would
have
judged
him
a
tourist
of
the
noisier
class
and
his
rather
loud
morning
as
he
entered
the
room
seemed
a
serious
menace
to
privacy
on
the
other
hand
the
rapid
buttoning
of
his
coat
and
the
quiet
choice
of
a
seat
as
far
as
possible
from
the
two
guests
whom
his
arrival
disturbed
indicated
a
certain
tact
his
greeting
had
met
with
the
merest
murmur
of
reply
their
eyes
on
their
plates
father
and
daughter
resolutely
disregarded
him
yet
he
ventured
to
speak
again
busy
here
not
a
seat
to
be
had
in
the
other
room
it
was
apologetic
in
intention
and
not
rudely
spoken
after
a
delay
the
bald
respectable
man
made
a
curt
response
room
is
public
i
believe
the
intruder
held
his
peace
but
more
than
once
he
glanced
at
the
girl
and
after
each
furtive
scrutiny
his
plain
visage
manifested
some
disturbance
a
troubled
thoughtfulness
his
one
look
at
the
mute
parent
was
from
beneath
contemptuous
eyebrows
very
soon
another
guest
appeared
a
massive
agricultural
man
who
descended
upon
a
creaking
chair
and
growled
a
remark
about
the
hot
weather
with
him
the
pedestrian
struck
into
talk
their
topic
was
beer
uncommonly
good
they
agreed
the
local
brew
and
each
called
for
a
second
pint
what
they
asked
in
concert
would
england
be
without
her
ale
shame
on
the
base
traffickers
who
enfeebled
or
poisoned
this
noble
liquor
and
how
cool
it
was
ah
the
right
sort
of
cellar
he
of
the
red
hair
hinted
at
a
third
pewter
these
two
were
still
but
midway
in
their
stout
attack
on
meat
and
drink
when
father
and
daughter
having
exchanged
a
few
whispers
rose
to
depart
after
leaving
the
room
the
girl
remembered
that
she
had
left
her
flowers
behind
she
durst
not
return
for
them
and
knowing
her
father
would
dislike
to
do
so
said
nothing
about
the
matter
pity
exclaimed
whiston
that
was
his
respectable
name
as
they
strolled
away
looked
at
first
as
if
we
should
have
such
a
nice
quiet
dinner
enjoyed
it
all
the
same
replied
his
companion
whose
name
was
rose
abominable
habit
of
drinking
added
whiston
austerely
he
himself
had
quaffed
water
as
always
ale
indeed
see
the
coarse
gross
creatures
it
produces
he
shuddered
rose
however
seemed
less
consentient
than
usual
her
eyes
were
on
the
ground
her
lips
were
closed
with
a
certain
firmness
when
she
spoke
it
was
on
quite
another
subject
they
were
londoners
whiston
held
the
position
of
draughtsman
in
the
office
of
a
geographical
publisher
though
his
income
was
small
he
had
always
practised
a
rigid
economy
and
the
possession
of
a
modest
private
capital
put
him
beyond
fear
of
reverses
profoundly
conscious
of
social
limits
he
felt
it
a
subject
for
gratitude
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
his
calling
which
he
might
fairly
regard
as
a
profession
and
he
nursed
this
sense
of
respectability
as
much
on
his
daughter
behalf
as
on
his
own
rose
was
an
only
child
her
mother
had
been
dead
for
years
her
kinsfolk
on
both
sides
laid
claim
to
the
title
of
gentlefolk
but
supported
it
on
the
narrowest
margin
of
independence
the
girl
had
grown
up
in
an
atmosphere
unfavourable
to
mental
development
but
she
had
received
a
fairly
good
education
and
nature
had
dowered
her
with
intelligence
a
sense
of
her
father
conscientiousness
and
of
his
true
affection
forbade
her
to
criticise
openly
the
principles
on
which
he
had
directed
her
life
hence
a
habit
of
solitary
meditation
which
half
fostered
yet
half
opposed
the
gentle
diffidence
of
rose
character
whiston
shrank
from
society
ceaselessly
afraid
of
receiving
less
than
his
due
privately
meanwhile
he
deplored
the
narrowness
of
the
social
opportunities
granted
to
his
daughter
and
was
for
ever
forming
schemes
for
her
advantage
schemes
which
never
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
nervous
speculation
they
inhabited
a
little
house
in
a
western
suburb
a
house
illumined
with
every
domestic
virtue
but
scarcely
a
dozen
persons
crossed
the
threshold
within
a
twelvemonth
rose
two
or
three
friends
were
like
herself
mistrustful
of
the
world
one
of
them
had
lately
married
after
a
very
long
engagement
and
rose
still
trembled
from
the
excitement
of
that
occasion
still
debated
fearfully
with
herself
on
the
bride
chances
of
happiness
her
own
marriage
was
an
event
so
inconceivable
that
merely
to
glance
at
the
thought
appeared
half
immodest
and
wholly
irrational
every
winter
whiston
talked
of
new
places
which
he
and
rose
would
visit
when
the
holidays
came
round
every
summer
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
adventurous
novelty
and
ended
by
proposing
a
return
to
the
same
western
to
the
familiar
lodgings
the
climate
suited
neither
him
nor
his
daughter
who
both
needed
physical
as
well
as
moral
bracing
but
they
only
thought
of
this
on
finding
themselves
at
home
again
with
another
long
year
of
monotony
before
them
and
it
was
so
good
to
feel
welcome
respected
to
receive
the
smiling
reverences
of
tradesfolk
to
talk
with
just
a
little
condescension
sure
that
it
would
be
appreciated
whiston
savoured
these
things
and
rose
in
this
respect
was
not
wholly
unlike
him
was
the
last
of
their
vacation
the
weather
had
been
magnificent
throughout
rose
cheeks
were
more
than
touched
by
the
sun
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
her
unpretending
comeliness
she
was
a
typical
english
maiden
rather
tall
shapely
rather
than
graceful
her
head
generally
bent
her
movements
always
betraying
the
diffidence
of
solitary
habit
the
lips
were
her
finest
feature
their
perfect
outline
indicating
sweetness
without
feebleness
of
character
such
a
girl
is
at
her
best
towards
the
stroke
of
thirty
rose
had
begun
to
know
herself
she
needed
only
opportunity
to
act
upon
her
knowledge
a
train
would
take
them
back
to
the
seaside
at
the
railway
station
rose
seated
herself
on
a
shaded
part
of
the
platform
whilst
her
father
who
was
exceedingly
short
of
sight
peered
over
publications
on
the
bookstall
rather
tired
after
her
walk
the
girl
was
dreamily
tracing
a
pattern
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
when
some
one
advanced
and
stood
immediately
in
front
of
her
startled
she
looked
up
and
recognised
the
stranger
of
the
inn
left
these
flowers
in
a
glass
of
water
on
the
table
i
hope
i
not
doing
a
rude
thing
in
asking
whether
they
were
left
by
accident
he
had
the
flowers
in
his
hand
their
stems
carefully
protected
by
a
piece
of
paper
for
a
moment
rose
was
incapable
of
replying
she
looked
at
the
speaker
she
felt
her
cheeks
burn
in
utter
embarrassment
she
said
she
knew
not
what
thank
you
i
forgot
them
it
very
kind
her
hand
touched
his
as
she
took
the
bouquet
from
him
without
another
word
the
man
turned
and
strode
away
whiston
had
seen
nothing
of
this
when
he
approached
rose
held
up
the
flowers
with
a
laugh
it
kind
i
forgot
them
you
know
and
some
one
from
the
inn
came
looking
for
me
good
of
them
very
replied
her
father
graciously
very
nice
inn
that
we
go
again
some
day
one
likes
to
encourage
such
civility
rare
nowadays
he
of
the
red
hair
travelled
by
the
same
train
though
not
in
the
same
carriage
rose
caught
sight
of
him
at
the
seaside
station
she
was
vexed
with
herself
for
having
so
scantily
acknowledged
his
kindness
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
not
really
thanked
him
at
all
how
absurd
at
her
age
to
be
incapable
of
common
at
the
same
time
she
kept
thinking
of
her
father
phrase
gross
creatures
and
it
vexed
her
even
more
than
her
own
ill
behaviour
the
stranger
was
certainly
not
coarse
far
from
gross
even
his
talk
about
beer
she
remembered
every
word
of
it
had
been
amusing
rather
than
offensive
was
he
a
the
question
agitated
her
it
involved
so
technical
a
definition
and
she
felt
so
doubtful
as
to
the
reply
beyond
doubt
he
had
acted
in
a
gentlemanly
way
but
his
voice
lacked
something
coarse
gross
no
no
no
really
her
father
was
very
severe
not
to
say
uncharitable
but
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
the
heavy
agricultural
man
oh
he
must
have
been
of
a
sudden
she
felt
very
weary
at
the
lodgings
she
sat
down
in
her
bedroom
and
gazed
through
the
open
window
at
the
sea
a
sense
of
discouragement
hitherto
almost
unknown
had
fallen
upon
her
it
spoilt
the
blue
sky
and
the
soft
horizon
she
thought
rather
drearily
of
the
townward
journey
of
her
home
in
the
suburbs
of
the
endless
monotony
that
awaited
her
the
flowers
lay
on
her
lap
she
smelt
them
dreamed
over
them
and
then
strange
incongruity
she
thought
of
beer
between
tea
and
supper
she
and
her
father
rested
on
the
beach
whiston
was
reading
rose
pretended
to
turn
the
leaves
of
a
book
of
a
sudden
as
unexpectedly
to
herself
as
to
her
companion
she
broke
silence
you
think
father
that
we
are
too
much
afraid
of
talking
with
strangers
much
afraid
whiston
was
puzzled
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
incident
at
the
mean
what
harm
is
there
in
having
a
little
conversation
when
one
is
away
from
home
at
the
inn
you
know
i
ca
help
thinking
we
were
rather
perhaps
a
little
too
silent
dear
rose
did
you
want
to
talk
about
beer
she
reddened
but
answered
all
the
more
emphatically
course
not
but
when
the
first
gentleman
came
in
would
it
have
been
natural
to
exchange
a
few
friendly
words
i
sure
he
would
have
talked
of
beer
to
i
saw
no
gentleman
my
dear
i
suppose
he
was
a
small
clerk
or
something
of
the
sort
and
he
had
no
business
whatever
to
address
us
but
he
only
said
good
morning
and
apologised
for
sitting
at
our
table
he
need
have
apologised
at
all
that
is
just
what
i
mean
said
whiston
with
dear
rose
if
i
had
been
alone
i
might
perhaps
have
talked
a
little
but
with
you
it
was
impossible
one
can
not
be
too
careful
a
man
like
that
will
take
all
sorts
of
liberties
one
has
to
keep
such
people
at
a
distance
a
moment
pause
then
rose
spoke
with
unusual
decision
feel
quite
sure
father
that
he
would
not
have
taken
liberties
it
seems
to
me
that
he
knew
quite
well
how
to
behave
himself
whiston
grew
still
more
puzzled
he
closed
his
book
to
meditate
this
new
problem
has
to
lay
down
rules
fell
from
him
at
length
sententiously
position
rose
as
i
have
often
explained
is
a
delicate
one
a
lady
in
circumstances
such
as
yours
can
not
exercise
too
much
caution
your
natural
associates
are
in
the
world
of
wealth
unhappily
i
can
not
make
you
wealthy
we
have
to
guard
our
my
dear
child
really
it
is
not
to
talk
with
strangers
least
of
all
at
an
inn
and
you
have
only
to
remember
that
disgusting
conversation
about
beer
rose
said
no
more
her
father
pondered
a
little
felt
that
he
had
delivered
his
soul
and
resumed
the
book
the
next
morning
they
were
early
at
the
station
to
secure
good
places
for
the
long
journey
to
london
up
to
almost
the
last
moment
it
seemed
that
they
would
have
a
carriage
to
themselves
then
the
door
suddenly
opened
a
bag
was
flung
on
to
the
seat
and
after
it
came
a
hot
panting
man
a
man
recognised
immediately
by
both
the
travellers
thought
i
missed
it
ejaculated
the
intruder
merrily
whiston
turned
his
head
away
disgust
transforming
his
countenance
rose
sat
motionless
her
eyes
cast
down
and
the
stranger
mopped
his
forehead
in
silence
he
glanced
at
her
he
glanced
again
and
again
and
rose
was
aware
of
every
look
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
feel
offended
on
the
contrary
she
fell
into
a
mood
of
tremulous
pleasure
enhanced
by
every
turn
of
the
eyes
in
her
direction
at
him
she
did
not
look
yet
she
saw
him
was
it
a
coarse
face
she
asked
herself
plain
perhaps
but
decidedly
not
vulgar
the
red
hair
she
thought
was
not
disagreeably
red
she
did
dislike
that
shade
of
colour
he
was
humming
a
tune
it
seemed
to
be
his
habit
and
it
argued
healthy
cheerfulness
meanwhile
whiston
sat
stiffly
in
his
corner
staring
at
the
landscape
a
model
of
respectable
muteness
at
the
first
stop
another
man
entered
this
time
unmistakably
a
commercial
traveller
at
once
a
dialogue
sprang
up
between
him
and
rufus
the
traveller
complained
that
all
the
smoking
compartments
were
full
exclaimed
rufus
with
a
laugh
reminds
me
that
i
wanted
a
smoke
i
never
thought
about
it
till
now
jumped
in
here
in
a
hurry
the
traveller
was
tobacco
they
talked
tobacco
rufus
with
much
gusto
presently
the
conversation
took
a
wider
scope
envy
you
cried
rufus
travelling
about
i
in
a
beastly
office
and
get
only
a
fortnight
off
once
a
year
i
enjoy
it
i
can
tell
you
time
up
today
worse
luck
i
a
good
mind
to
emigrate
can
you
give
me
a
tip
about
the
colonies
he
talked
of
how
he
had
spent
his
holiday
rose
missed
not
a
word
and
her
blood
pulsed
in
sympathy
with
the
joy
of
freedom
which
he
expressed
she
did
not
mind
his
occasional
slang
the
tone
was
manly
and
it
evinced
a
certain
simplicity
of
feeling
by
no
means
common
in
men
whether
gentle
or
other
at
a
certain
moment
the
girl
was
impelled
to
steal
a
glimpse
of
his
face
after
all
was
it
really
so
plain
the
features
seemed
to
her
to
have
a
certain
refinement
which
she
had
not
noticed
before
going
to
try
for
a
smoker
said
the
man
of
commerce
as
the
train
slackened
into
a
busy
station
rufus
hesitated
his
eye
wandered
think
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
he
ended
by
saying
in
that
same
moment
for
the
first
time
rose
met
his
glance
she
saw
that
his
eyes
did
not
at
once
avert
themselves
they
had
a
singular
expression
a
smile
which
pleaded
pardon
for
its
audacity
and
rose
even
whilst
turning
away
smiled
in
response
the
train
stopped
the
commercial
traveller
alighted
rose
leaning
towards
her
father
whispered
that
she
was
thirsty
would
he
get
her
a
glass
of
milk
or
of
lemonade
though
little
disposed
to
rush
on
such
errands
whiston
had
no
choice
but
to
comply
he
sped
at
once
for
the
and
rose
knew
what
would
happen
she
knew
perfectly
sitting
rigid
her
eyes
on
vacancy
she
felt
the
approach
of
the
young
man
who
for
the
moment
was
alone
with
her
she
saw
him
at
her
side
she
heard
his
voice
ca
help
it
i
want
to
speak
to
you
may
i
rose
faltered
a
reply
was
so
kind
to
bring
the
flowers
i
did
thank
you
properly
now
or
never
pursued
the
young
man
in
rapid
excited
tones
you
let
me
tell
you
my
name
will
you
tell
me
yours
rose
silence
consented
the
daring
rufus
rent
a
page
from
a
scribbled
his
name
and
address
gave
it
to
rose
he
rent
out
another
page
offered
it
to
rose
with
the
pencil
and
in
a
moment
had
secured
the
precious
scrap
of
paper
in
his
pocket
scarce
was
the
transaction
completed
when
a
stranger
jumped
in
the
young
man
bounded
to
his
own
corner
just
in
time
to
see
the
return
of
whiston
glass
in
hand
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
rose
was
in
the
strangest
state
of
mind
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
ashamed
of
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
what
had
happened
was
wholly
natural
and
simple
the
extraordinary
thing
was
that
she
must
sit
silent
and
with
cold
countenance
at
the
distance
of
a
few
feet
from
a
person
with
whom
she
ardently
desired
to
converse
sudden
illumination
had
wholly
changed
the
aspect
of
life
she
seemed
to
be
playing
a
part
in
a
grotesque
comedy
rather
than
living
in
a
world
of
grave
realities
her
father
dignified
silence
struck
her
as
intolerably
absurd
she
could
have
burst
into
laughter
at
moments
she
was
indignant
irritated
tremulous
with
the
spirit
of
revolt
she
detected
a
glance
of
frigid
superiority
with
which
whiston
chanced
to
survey
the
other
occupants
of
the
compartment
it
amazed
her
never
had
she
seen
her
father
in
such
an
alien
light
he
bent
forward
and
addressed
to
her
some
commonplace
remark
she
barely
deigned
a
reply
her
views
of
conduct
of
character
had
undergone
an
abrupt
and
extraordinary
change
having
justified
without
shadow
of
argument
her
own
incredible
proceeding
she
judged
everything
and
everybody
by
some
new
standard
mysteriously
attained
she
was
no
longer
the
rose
whiston
of
yesterday
her
old
self
seemed
an
object
of
compassion
she
felt
an
unspeakable
happiness
and
at
the
same
time
an
encroaching
fear
the
fear
predominated
when
she
grew
aware
of
the
streets
of
london
looming
on
either
hand
it
became
a
torment
an
anguish
crushed
within
her
palm
the
piece
of
paper
with
its
still
unread
inscription
seemed
to
burn
her
once
twice
thrice
she
met
the
look
of
her
friend
he
smiled
cheerily
bravely
with
evident
purpose
of
encouragement
she
knew
his
face
better
than
that
of
any
oldest
acquaintance
she
saw
in
it
a
manly
beauty
only
by
a
great
effort
of
could
she
refrain
from
turning
aside
to
unfold
and
read
what
he
had
written
the
train
slackened
speed
stopped
yes
it
was
london
she
must
arise
and
go
once
more
their
eyes
met
then
without
recollection
of
any
interval
she
was
on
the
metropolitan
railway
moving
towards
her
suburban
home
a
severe
headache
sent
her
early
to
bed
beneath
her
pillow
lay
a
scrap
of
paper
with
a
name
and
address
she
was
not
likely
to
forget
and
through
the
night
of
broken
slumbers
rose
suffered
a
martyrdom
no
more
all
her
courage
gone
all
her
new
vitality
she
saw
herself
with
the
old
eyes
and
was
to
the
very
heart
whose
the
fault
towards
dawn
she
argued
it
with
the
bitterness
of
misery
what
a
life
was
hers
in
this
little
world
of
choking
respectabilities
forbidden
this
forbidden
that
permitted
the
pride
of
ladyhood
and
she
was
not
a
lady
after
all
what
lady
would
have
permitted
herself
to
exchange
names
and
addresses
with
a
strange
man
in
a
railway
carriage
furtively
too
escaping
her
father
observation
if
not
a
lady
what
she
it
meant
the
utter
failure
of
her
breeding
and
education
the
sole
end
for
which
she
had
lived
was
frustrate
a
common
vulgar
young
woman
well
mated
doubtless
with
an
impudent
clerk
whose
noisy
talk
was
of
beer
and
tobacco
this
arrested
her
stung
to
the
defence
of
her
friend
who
clerk
though
he
might
be
was
neither
impudent
nor
vulgar
she
found
herself
driven
back
upon
the
battle
went
on
for
hours
it
exhausted
her
it
undid
all
the
good
effects
of
sun
and
sea
and
left
her
flaccid
pale
afraid
the
journey
yesterday
was
too
much
for
you
remarked
whiston
after
observing
her
as
she
sat
mute
the
next
evening
shall
soon
recover
rose
answered
coldly
the
father
meditated
with
some
uneasiness
he
had
not
forgotten
singular
expression
of
opinion
after
their
dinner
at
the
inn
his
affection
made
him
sensitive
to
changes
in
the
girl
demeanour
next
summer
they
must
really
find
a
more
bracing
resort
yes
yes
clearly
rose
needed
bracing
but
she
was
always
better
when
the
cool
days
came
round
on
the
morrow
it
was
his
daughter
turn
to
feel
anxious
whiston
all
at
once
wore
a
face
of
indignant
severity
he
was
he
sat
at
table
with
scarce
a
word
he
had
little
nervous
movements
and
subdued
mutterings
as
of
wrath
this
continued
on
a
second
day
and
rose
began
to
suffer
an
intolerable
agitation
she
could
not
help
connecting
her
strange
behaviour
with
the
secret
which
tormented
her
heart
had
something
happened
had
her
friend
seen
whiston
or
written
to
him
she
had
awaited
with
tremors
every
arrival
of
the
post
it
was
probable
more
than
probable
that
would
write
to
her
but
as
yet
no
letter
came
a
week
passed
and
no
letter
came
her
father
was
himself
again
plainly
she
had
mistaken
the
cause
of
his
perturbation
ten
days
and
no
letter
came
it
was
saturday
afternoon
whiston
reached
home
at
the
first
glance
showed
his
daughter
that
trouble
and
anger
once
more
beset
him
she
trembled
and
all
but
wept
for
suspense
had
overwrought
her
nerves
find
myself
obliged
to
speak
to
you
on
a
very
disagreeable
subject
thus
began
whiston
over
the
very
unpleasant
subject
indeed
my
one
consolation
is
that
it
will
probably
settle
a
little
argument
we
had
down
at
the
seaside
as
his
habit
was
when
expressing
grave
opinions
and
whiston
seldom
expressed
any
other
he
made
a
long
pause
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thin
beard
the
delay
irritated
rose
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
fact
is
he
proceeded
at
length
week
ago
i
received
a
most
extraordinary
letter
the
most
impudent
letter
i
ever
read
in
my
life
it
came
from
that
noisy
man
who
intruded
upon
us
at
the
inn
you
remember
he
began
by
explaining
who
he
was
and
if
you
can
believe
it
had
the
impertinence
to
say
that
he
wished
to
make
my
acquaintance
an
amazing
letter
naturally
i
left
it
unanswered
the
only
dignified
thing
to
do
but
the
fellow
wrote
again
asking
if
i
had
received
his
proposal
i
now
replied
briefly
and
severely
asking
him
first
how
he
came
to
know
my
name
secondly
what
reason
i
had
given
him
for
supposing
that
i
desired
to
meet
him
again
his
answer
to
this
was
even
more
outrageous
than
the
first
offence
he
bluntly
informed
me
that
in
order
to
discover
my
name
and
address
he
had
followed
us
home
that
day
from
paddington
station
as
if
this
was
not
bad
enough
he
went
on
to
really
rose
i
feel
i
must
apologise
to
you
but
the
fact
is
i
seem
to
have
no
choice
but
to
tell
you
what
he
said
the
fellow
tells
me
really
that
he
wants
to
know
only
that
he
may
come
to
know
my
first
idea
was
to
go
with
this
letter
to
the
police
i
am
not
sure
that
i
sha
do
so
even
yet
most
certainly
i
shall
if
he
writes
again
the
man
may
be
crazy
he
may
be
dangerous
who
knows
but
he
may
come
lurking
about
the
house
i
felt
obliged
to
warn
you
of
this
unpleasant
possibility
rose
was
stirring
her
tea
also
she
was
smiling
she
continued
to
stir
and
to
smile
without
consciousness
of
either
performance
make
light
of
it
exclaimed
her
father
solemnly
father
of
course
i
am
sorry
you
have
had
this
annoyance
so
little
was
there
of
manifest
sorrow
in
the
girl
tone
and
countenance
that
whiston
gazed
at
her
rather
indignantly
his
pregnant
pause
gave
birth
to
one
of
those
admonitory
axioms
which
had
hitherto
ruled
his
daughter
life
dear
i
advise
you
never
to
trifle
with
questions
of
propriety
could
there
possibly
be
a
better
illustration
of
what
i
have
so
often
said
that
in
we
are
bound
to
keep
strangers
at
a
distance
rose
began
firmly
but
her
voice
failed
were
going
to
say
rose
she
took
her
courage
in
both
hands
you
allow
me
to
see
the
letters
there
can
be
no
objection
to
that
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
three
envelopes
held
them
to
his
daughter
with
shaking
hand
rose
unfolded
the
first
letter
it
was
written
in
clear
commercial
character
and
was
signed
james
burroughs
when
she
had
read
all
the
girl
said
quietly
you
quite
sure
father
that
these
letters
are
impertinent
whiston
stopped
in
the
act
of
his
beard
doubt
can
there
be
of
it
seem
to
me
proceeded
rose
nervously
be
very
respectful
and
very
honest
dear
you
astound
me
is
it
respectful
to
force
one
acquaintance
upon
an
unwilling
stranger
i
really
do
understand
you
where
is
your
sense
of
propriety
rose
a
vulgar
noisy
fellow
who
talks
of
beer
and
tobacco
a
petty
clerk
and
he
has
the
audacity
to
write
to
me
that
he
wants
to
to
make
friends
with
my
daughter
respectful
honest
really
when
whiston
became
sufficiently
agitated
to
lose
his
decorous
gravity
he
began
to
splutter
and
at
such
moments
he
was
not
impressive
rose
kept
her
eyes
cast
down
she
felt
her
strength
once
more
the
strength
of
a
wholly
reasonable
and
revolt
against
that
tyrannous
propriety
which
whiston
worshipped
my
dear
is
only
one
thing
i
dislike
in
these
letters
and
that
is
a
falsehood
do
understand
rose
was
flushing
her
nerves
grew
tense
she
had
wrought
herself
to
a
simple
audacity
which
overcame
small
embarrassments
burroughs
says
that
he
followed
us
home
from
paddington
to
discover
our
address
that
is
not
true
he
asked
me
for
my
name
and
address
in
the
train
and
gave
me
his
the
father
gasped
you
was
whilst
you
were
away
in
the
proceeded
the
girl
with
singular
in
a
voice
almost
ought
to
tell
you
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
burroughs
who
brought
me
the
flowers
from
the
inn
when
i
forgot
them
you
did
see
him
give
them
to
me
in
the
station
the
father
stared
rose
what
does
all
this
mean
you
you
overwhelm
me
go
on
please
what
next
father
and
of
a
sudden
the
girl
was
so
beset
with
confusing
emotions
that
she
hurriedly
quitted
her
chair
and
vanished
from
the
room
before
whiston
returned
to
his
geographical
drawing
on
monday
morning
he
had
held
long
conversations
with
rose
and
still
longer
with
himself
not
easily
could
he
perceive
the
justice
of
his
daughter
quarrel
with
propriety
many
days
were
to
pass
indeed
before
he
would
consent
to
do
more
than
make
inquiries
about
charles
james
burroughs
and
to
permit
that
aggressive
young
man
to
give
a
fuller
account
of
himself
in
writing
it
was
by
silence
that
rose
prevailed
having
defended
herself
against
the
charge
of
immodesty
she
declined
to
urge
her
own
inclination
or
the
rights
of
burroughs
her
mute
patience
did
not
lack
its
effect
with
the
scrupulous
but
tender
parent
am
willing
to
admit
my
dear
said
whiston
one
evening
of
nothing
at
all
the
falsehood
in
that
young
man
letter
gave
proof
of
a
certain
delicacy
you
father
replied
rose
very
quietly
and
simply
it
was
next
morning
that
the
father
posted
a
formal
proper
note
of
invitation
which
bore
results
a
poor
gentleman
it
was
in
the
after
dinner
charman
the
large
and
kindly
hostess
sank
into
a
chair
beside
her
little
friend
loring
and
sighed
a
question
do
you
like
mr
tymperley
nice
just
a
little
peculiar
he
peculiar
quite
original
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
him
before
we
went
down
but
there
was
time
such
a
very
old
friend
of
ours
my
dear
husband
and
he
were
at
school
together
harrovians
the
sweetest
the
most
affectionate
character
too
good
for
this
world
i
afraid
he
takes
everything
so
seriously
i
shall
never
forget
his
grief
at
my
poor
husband
i
telling
loring
about
tymperley
ada
she
addressed
her
married
daughter
a
quiet
young
woman
who
reproduced
charman
countenance
with
something
more
of
intelligence
the
reflective
serenity
of
a
higher
type
sorry
to
see
him
looking
so
far
from
well
remarked
weare
in
reply
never
had
any
colour
you
know
and
his
life
but
i
must
tell
you
she
resumed
to
loring
a
bachelor
in
comfortable
circumstances
and
would
you
believe
it
he
lives
quite
alone
in
one
of
the
distressing
parts
of
london
where
is
it
ada
poor
street
in
islington
there
he
lives
i
afraid
in
shocking
lodgings
it
must
be
unhealthy
just
to
become
acquainted
with
the
life
of
poor
people
and
be
helpful
to
them
is
it
heroic
he
seems
to
have
given
up
his
whole
life
to
it
one
never
meets
him
anywhere
i
think
ours
is
the
only
house
where
he
seen
a
noble
life
he
never
talks
about
it
i
sure
you
would
never
have
suspected
such
a
thing
from
his
conversation
at
dinner
for
a
moment
answered
loring
astonished
was
very
gossipy
i
gathered
that
his
chief
interests
were
fretwork
and
foreign
politics
weare
laughed
very
man
when
i
was
a
little
girl
he
used
to
make
all
sorts
of
pretty
things
for
me
with
his
and
when
i
grew
old
enough
he
instructed
me
in
the
balance
of
power
it
possible
mamma
that
he
writes
leading
articles
we
should
never
hear
of
it
dear
anything
is
possible
with
tymperley
and
such
a
change
this
after
his
country
life
he
had
a
beautiful
little
house
near
ours
in
berkshire
i
really
ca
help
thinking
that
my
husband
death
caused
him
to
leave
it
he
was
so
attached
to
charman
when
my
husband
died
and
we
left
berkshire
we
altogether
lost
sight
of
him
oh
for
a
couple
of
years
then
i
met
him
by
chance
in
london
ada
thinks
there
must
have
been
some
sentimental
trouble
mamma
interposed
the
daughter
was
you
not
i
who
suggested
that
it
well
perhaps
it
was
one
ca
help
seeing
that
he
has
gone
through
something
of
course
it
may
be
only
pity
for
the
poor
souls
he
gives
his
life
to
a
wonderful
man
when
masculine
voices
sounded
at
the
door
loring
looked
curiously
for
the
eccentric
gentleman
he
entered
last
of
all
a
man
of
more
than
middle
height
but
much
bowed
in
the
shoulders
thin
ungraceful
with
an
irresolute
step
and
a
shy
demeanour
his
eyes
very
soft
in
expression
looked
timidly
this
way
and
that
from
beneath
brows
nervously
bent
and
a
smile
wavered
upon
his
lips
his
hair
had
begun
to
thin
and
to
turn
grey
but
he
had
a
heavy
moustache
which
would
better
have
sorted
with
sterner
lineaments
as
he
walked
or
sidled
into
the
room
his
hands
kept
shutting
and
opening
with
rather
ludicrous
effect
something
which
was
not
exactly
shabbiness
but
a
lack
of
lustre
of
finish
singled
him
among
the
group
of
men
looking
closer
one
saw
that
his
black
suit
belonged
to
a
fashion
some
years
old
his
linen
was
irreproachable
but
he
wore
no
sort
of
jewellery
one
little
black
stud
showing
on
his
front
and
at
the
cuffs
solitaires
of
the
same
simple
description
he
drifted
into
a
corner
and
there
would
have
sat
alone
seemingly
at
peace
had
not
weare
presently
moved
to
a
seat
beside
him
hope
you
wo
be
staying
in
town
through
august
mr
tymperley
oh
no
oh
no
i
think
not
you
seem
uncertain
do
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
i
sure
you
need
a
change
really
you
know
you
are
looking
quite
the
thing
now
i
persuade
you
to
join
us
at
lucerne
my
husband
would
be
so
pleased
delighted
to
talk
with
you
about
the
state
of
europe
give
us
a
fortnight
do
dear
weare
you
are
kindness
itself
i
am
deeply
grateful
i
easily
express
my
sense
of
your
most
friendly
thoughtfulness
but
the
truth
is
i
am
half
engaged
to
other
friends
indeed
i
think
i
may
almost
say
that
i
have
practically
yes
indeed
it
amounts
to
that
he
spoke
in
a
thinly
fluting
voice
with
a
preciseness
of
enunciation
akin
to
the
more
feebly
clerical
and
with
smiles
which
became
almost
lachrymose
in
their
expressiveness
as
he
dropped
from
phrase
to
phrase
of
embarrassed
circumlocution
and
his
long
bony
hands
writhed
together
till
the
knuckles
were
white
so
long
as
you
going
away
i
so
afraid
lest
your
conscientiousness
should
go
too
far
you
wo
benefit
anybody
you
know
by
making
yourself
not
ha
ha
i
assure
you
that
fact
is
patent
to
me
health
is
a
primary
consideration
nothing
more
detrimental
to
one
usefulness
than
an
impaired
oh
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
the
strain
upon
your
sympathies
that
must
affect
one
health
quite
apart
from
an
unhealthy
atmosphere
islington
is
not
unhealthy
my
dear
weare
believe
me
the
air
has
often
quite
a
tonic
quality
we
are
so
high
you
must
remember
if
only
we
could
subdue
in
some
degree
the
noxious
exhalations
of
domestic
and
industrial
chimneys
oh
i
assure
you
islington
has
every
natural
feature
of
salubrity
before
the
close
of
the
evening
there
was
a
little
music
which
tymperley
seemed
much
to
enjoy
he
let
his
head
fall
back
and
stared
upwards
remaining
rapt
in
that
posture
for
some
moments
after
the
music
ceased
and
at
length
recovering
himself
with
a
sigh
when
he
left
the
house
he
donned
an
overcoat
considerably
too
thick
for
the
season
and
bestowed
in
the
pockets
his
shoes
his
hat
was
a
hard
felt
high
in
the
crown
he
grasped
an
umbrella
and
set
forth
at
a
brisk
walk
as
if
for
the
neighbouring
station
but
the
railway
was
not
his
goal
nor
yet
the
omnibus
through
the
ambrosial
night
he
walked
and
walked
at
the
steady
pace
of
one
accustomed
to
pedestrian
exercise
from
notting
hill
gate
to
the
marble
arch
from
the
marble
arch
to
new
oxford
street
thence
by
theobald
road
to
pentonville
and
up
and
up
until
he
attained
the
heights
of
his
own
salubrious
quarter
long
after
midnight
he
entered
a
narrow
byway
which
the
pale
moon
showed
to
be
decent
though
not
inviting
he
admitted
himself
with
a
latchkey
to
a
little
house
which
smelt
of
glue
lit
a
which
he
found
in
his
pocket
and
ascended
two
flights
of
stairs
to
a
back
bedroom
its
size
eight
feet
by
seven
and
a
half
a
few
minutes
more
and
he
lay
sound
asleep
waking
at
eight
he
knew
the
time
by
a
bell
that
clanged
in
the
neighbourhood
tymperley
clad
himself
with
nervous
haste
on
opening
his
door
he
found
lying
outside
a
tray
with
the
materials
of
a
breakfast
reduced
to
its
lowest
terms
half
a
pint
of
milk
bread
butter
at
nine
he
went
downstairs
tapped
civilly
at
the
door
of
the
front
parlour
and
by
an
untuned
voice
was
bidden
enter
the
room
was
occupied
by
an
oldish
man
and
a
girl
addressing
themselves
to
the
day
work
of
plain
bookbinding
morning
to
you
sir
said
tymperley
bending
his
head
morning
miss
suggs
bright
sunny
how
it
cheers
one
he
stood
rubbing
his
hands
as
one
might
on
a
morning
of
sharp
frost
the
bookbinder
with
a
dry
nod
for
greeting
forthwith
set
tymperley
a
task
to
which
that
gentleman
zealously
applied
himself
he
was
learning
the
elementary
processes
of
the
art
he
worked
with
patience
and
some
show
of
natural
aptitude
all
through
the
working
hours
of
the
day
to
this
pass
had
things
come
with
tymperley
a
gentleman
of
berkshire
once
living
in
comfort
and
modest
dignity
on
the
fruit
of
sound
investments
schooled
at
harrow
a
graduate
of
cambridge
he
had
meditated
the
choice
of
a
profession
until
it
seemed
on
the
whole
too
late
to
profess
anything
at
all
and
as
there
was
no
need
of
such
exertion
he
settled
himself
to
a
life
of
innocent
idleness
hard
by
the
of
his
wealthy
and
influential
friend
charman
softly
the
years
flowed
by
his
thoughts
turned
once
or
twice
to
marriage
but
a
profound
diffidence
withheld
him
from
the
initial
step
in
the
end
he
knew
himself
born
for
bachelorhood
and
with
that
estate
was
content
well
for
him
had
he
seen
as
clearly
the
delusiveness
of
other
temptations
in
an
evil
moment
he
listened
to
charman
whose
familiar
talk
was
of
speculation
of
companies
of
shining
percentages
not
on
his
own
account
was
tymperley
lured
he
had
enough
and
to
spare
but
he
thought
of
his
sister
married
to
an
unsuccessful
provincial
barrister
and
of
her
six
children
whom
it
would
be
pleasant
to
help
like
the
opulent
uncle
of
fiction
at
their
entering
upon
the
world
in
charman
he
put
blind
faith
with
the
result
that
one
morning
he
found
himself
shivering
on
the
edge
of
ruin
the
touch
of
confirmatory
news
and
over
he
went
no
one
was
aware
of
it
but
charman
himself
and
he
a
few
days
later
lay
sick
unto
death
charman
own
estate
suffered
inappreciably
from
what
to
his
friend
meant
sheer
disaster
and
tymperley
breathed
not
a
word
to
the
widow
spoke
not
a
word
to
any
one
at
all
except
the
lawyer
who
quietly
wound
up
his
affairs
and
the
sister
whose
children
must
needs
go
without
avuncular
aid
during
the
absence
of
his
friendly
neighbours
after
charman
death
he
quietly
disappeared
the
poor
gentleman
was
then
close
upon
forty
years
old
there
remained
to
him
a
capital
which
he
durst
not
expend
invested
it
bore
him
an
income
upon
which
a
labourer
could
scarce
have
subsisted
the
only
possible
place
of
residence
because
the
only
sure
place
of
hiding
was
london
and
to
london
tymperley
betook
himself
not
at
once
did
he
learn
the
art
of
combating
starvation
with
minim
resources
during
his
initiatory
trials
he
was
once
brought
so
low
by
hunger
and
humiliation
that
he
swallowed
something
of
his
pride
and
wrote
to
a
certain
acquaintance
asking
counsel
and
indirect
help
but
only
a
man
in
tymperley
position
learns
how
vain
is
advice
and
how
impotent
is
social
influence
had
he
begged
for
money
he
would
have
received
no
doubt
a
cheque
with
words
of
compassion
but
tymperley
could
never
bring
himself
to
that
he
tried
to
make
profit
of
his
former
amusement
fretwork
and
to
a
certain
extent
succeeded
earning
in
six
months
half
a
sovereign
but
the
prospect
of
adding
one
pound
a
year
to
his
starveling
dividends
did
not
greatly
exhilarate
him
all
this
time
he
was
of
course
living
in
absolute
solitude
poverty
is
the
great
secluder
unless
one
belongs
to
the
rank
which
is
born
to
it
a
sensitive
man
who
no
longer
finds
himself
on
equal
terms
with
his
natural
associates
shrinks
into
loneliness
and
learns
with
some
surprise
how
very
willing
people
are
to
forget
his
existence
london
is
a
wilderness
abounding
in
anchorites
voluntary
or
constrained
as
he
wandered
about
the
streets
and
parks
or
killed
time
in
museums
and
galleries
where
nothing
had
to
be
paid
tymperley
often
recognised
brethren
in
seclusion
he
understood
the
furtive
glance
which
met
his
own
he
read
the
peaked
visage
marked
with
understanding
sympathy
the
apparel
no
interchange
of
confidences
between
these
lurking
mortals
they
would
like
to
speak
but
pride
holds
them
aloof
each
goes
on
his
silent
and
unfriended
way
until
by
good
luck
he
finds
himself
in
hospital
or
workhouse
when
at
length
the
tongue
is
loosed
and
the
sore
heart
pours
forth
its
reproach
of
the
world
strange
knowledge
comes
to
a
man
in
this
position
he
learns
wondrous
economies
and
will
feel
a
sort
of
pride
in
his
ultimate
discovery
of
how
little
money
is
needed
to
support
life
in
his
old
days
tymperley
would
have
laid
it
down
as
an
axiom
that
can
not
live
on
less
than
an
income
he
found
that
man
can
live
on
a
few
coppers
a
day
he
became
aware
of
the
prices
of
things
to
eat
and
was
taught
the
relative
virtues
of
nutriment
perforce
a
vegetarian
he
found
that
a
vegetable
diet
was
good
for
his
health
and
delivered
to
himself
many
a
scornful
speech
on
the
habits
of
the
carnivorous
multitude
he
of
necessity
abjured
alcohols
and
straightway
longed
to
utter
his
testimony
on
a
teetotal
platform
these
were
his
satisfactions
they
compensate
astonishingly
for
the
loss
of
many
kinds
of
but
it
happened
one
day
that
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
drawing
his
poor
little
quarterly
salvage
at
the
bank
of
england
a
lady
saw
him
and
knew
him
it
was
charman
widow
tymperley
what
become
of
you
all
this
time
why
have
i
never
heard
from
you
is
it
true
as
some
one
told
me
that
you
have
been
living
abroad
so
utterly
was
he
disconcerted
that
in
a
mechanical
way
he
echoed
the
lady
last
word
why
did
you
write
to
us
pursued
charman
leaving
him
no
time
to
say
more
very
unkind
why
did
you
go
away
without
a
word
my
daughter
says
that
we
must
have
unconsciously
offended
you
in
some
way
do
explain
surely
there
ca
have
been
dear
charman
it
is
i
alone
who
am
to
blame
i
the
explanation
is
difficult
it
involves
a
multiplicity
of
detail
i
beg
you
to
interpret
my
unjustifiable
behaviour
as
as
pure
idiosyncrasy
you
must
come
and
see
me
you
know
that
ada
married
yes
nearly
a
year
ago
how
glad
she
will
be
to
see
you
again
so
often
she
has
spoken
of
you
when
can
you
dine
pleasure
with
great
pleasure
she
gave
her
address
and
they
parted
now
a
proof
that
tymperley
had
never
lost
all
hope
of
restitution
to
his
native
world
lay
in
the
fact
of
his
having
carefully
preserved
an
with
the
appropriate
shoes
many
a
time
had
he
been
sorely
tempted
to
sell
these
seeming
superfluities
more
than
once
towards
the
end
of
his
pinched
quarter
the
suit
had
been
pledged
for
a
few
shillings
but
to
part
with
the
supreme
symbol
of
respectability
would
have
meant
despair
a
state
of
mind
alien
to
tymperley
passive
fortitude
his
jewellery
even
watch
and
chain
had
long
since
gone
such
gauds
are
not
indispensable
to
a
gentleman
outfit
he
now
congratulated
himself
on
his
prudence
for
the
meeting
with
charman
had
delighted
as
much
as
it
embarrassed
him
and
the
prospect
of
an
evening
in
society
made
his
heart
glow
he
hastened
home
he
examined
his
garb
of
ceremony
with
anxious
care
and
found
no
glaring
defect
in
it
a
shirt
a
collar
a
necktie
must
needs
be
purchased
happily
he
had
the
means
but
how
explain
himself
could
he
confess
his
place
of
abode
his
startling
poverty
to
do
so
would
be
to
make
an
appeal
to
the
compassion
of
his
old
friends
and
from
that
he
shrank
in
horror
a
gentleman
will
not
can
possibly
be
avoided
reveal
circumstances
likely
to
cause
pain
must
he
then
tell
or
imply
a
falsehood
the
whole
truth
involved
a
reproach
of
charman
husband
a
thought
he
could
not
bear
the
next
evening
found
him
still
worrying
over
this
dilemma
he
reached
charman
house
without
having
come
to
any
decision
in
the
three
persons
awaited
him
the
hostess
with
her
daughter
and
and
weare
the
cordiality
of
his
reception
moved
him
all
but
to
tears
overcome
by
many
emotions
he
lost
his
head
he
talked
at
random
and
the
result
was
so
strange
a
piece
of
fiction
that
no
sooner
had
he
evolved
it
than
he
stood
aghast
at
himself
it
came
in
reply
to
the
natural
question
where
he
was
residing
present
he
smiled
fatuously
inhabit
a
in
a
little
street
up
at
islington
dead
silence
followed
eyes
of
wonder
were
fixed
upon
him
but
for
those
eyes
who
knows
what
confession
tymperley
might
have
made
as
it
was
said
charman
that
i
had
to
confess
to
an
eccentricity
i
hope
it
wo
shock
you
to
be
brief
i
have
devoted
my
poor
energies
to
social
work
i
live
among
the
poor
and
as
one
of
them
to
obtain
knowledge
that
can
not
be
otherwise
procured
how
noble
exclaimed
the
hostess
the
poor
gentleman
conscience
smote
him
terribly
he
could
say
no
more
to
spare
his
delicacy
his
friends
turned
the
conversation
then
or
afterwards
it
never
occurred
to
them
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
he
had
said
charman
had
seen
him
transacting
business
at
the
bank
of
england
a
place
not
suggestive
of
poverty
and
he
had
always
passed
for
a
man
somewhat
original
in
his
views
and
ways
thus
was
tymperley
committed
to
a
singular
piece
of
deception
a
fraud
which
could
not
easily
be
discovered
and
which
injured
only
its
perpetrator
since
then
about
a
year
had
elapsed
tymperley
had
seen
his
friends
perhaps
half
a
dozen
times
his
enjoyment
of
their
society
pathetically
intense
but
troubled
by
any
slightest
allusion
to
his
mode
of
life
it
had
come
to
be
understood
that
he
made
it
a
matter
of
principle
to
hide
his
light
under
a
bushel
so
he
seldom
had
to
take
a
new
step
in
positive
falsehood
of
course
he
regretted
ceaselessly
the
original
deceit
for
charman
a
wealthy
woman
might
very
well
have
assisted
him
to
some
not
undignified
mode
of
earning
his
living
as
it
was
he
had
hit
upon
the
idea
of
making
himself
a
bookbinder
a
craft
somewhat
to
his
taste
for
some
months
he
had
lodged
in
the
bookbinder
house
one
day
courage
came
to
him
and
he
entered
into
a
compact
with
his
landlord
whereby
he
was
to
pay
for
instruction
by
a
certain
period
of
unremunerated
work
after
he
became
proficient
that
stage
was
now
approaching
on
the
whole
he
felt
much
happier
than
in
the
time
of
brooding
idleness
he
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
he
would
have
a
little
more
money
in
his
pocket
and
no
longer
dread
the
last
fortnight
of
each
quarter
with
its
supperless
nights
weare
invitation
to
lucerne
cost
him
pangs
lucerne
surely
it
was
in
some
former
state
of
existence
that
he
had
taken
delightful
holidays
as
a
matter
of
course
he
thought
of
the
many
lovely
places
he
knew
and
so
many
the
london
streets
made
them
infinitely
remote
utterly
unreal
his
three
years
of
gloom
and
hardship
were
longer
than
all
the
life
of
placid
contentment
that
came
before
lucerne
a
man
of
more
vigorous
temper
would
have
been
maddened
at
the
thought
but
tymperley
nursed
it
all
day
long
his
emotions
only
expressing
themselves
in
a
little
sigh
or
a
sadly
wistful
smile
having
dined
so
well
yesterday
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
expend
less
than
usual
on
meals
about
eight
in
the
evening
after
a
meditative
stroll
in
the
air
which
he
had
so
praised
he
entered
the
shop
where
he
was
wont
to
make
his
modest
purchases
a
fat
woman
behind
the
counter
nodded
familiarly
to
him
with
a
grin
at
another
customer
tymperley
bowed
as
was
his
courteous
habit
me
he
said
one
egg
and
a
small
crisp
lettuce
one
eh
said
the
woman
you
only
one
he
replied
as
if
speaking
in
a
me
if
i
express
a
hope
that
it
will
be
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
the
last
i
fancy
had
got
into
that
box
by
some
oversight
pardonable
in
the
press
of
business
always
the
same
said
the
fat
shopkeeper
do
make
no
mistakes
of
that
kind
forgive
me
perhaps
i
imagined
egg
and
lettuce
were
carefully
deposited
in
a
little
handbag
he
carried
and
he
returned
home
an
hour
later
when
his
meal
was
finished
and
he
sat
on
a
chair
meditating
in
the
twilight
a
rap
sounded
at
his
door
and
a
letter
was
handed
to
him
so
rarely
did
a
letter
arrive
for
tymperley
that
his
hand
shook
as
he
examined
the
envelope
on
opening
it
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
cheque
this
excited
him
still
more
he
unfolded
the
written
sheet
with
agitation
it
came
from
weare
who
wrote
thus
dear
tymperley
after
our
talk
last
evening
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
you
and
your
beautiful
life
of
i
contrasted
the
lot
of
these
poor
people
with
my
own
which
one
can
not
but
feel
is
so
undeservedly
blest
and
so
rich
in
enjoyments
as
a
result
of
these
thoughts
i
feel
impelled
to
send
you
a
little
contribution
to
your
good
work
a
sort
of
at
the
moment
of
setting
off
for
a
happy
holiday
divide
the
money
please
among
two
or
three
of
your
most
deserving
pensioners
or
if
you
see
fit
give
it
all
to
one
i
cling
to
the
hope
that
we
may
see
you
at
with
very
kind
regards
the
cheque
was
for
five
pounds
tymperley
held
it
up
by
the
window
and
gazed
at
it
by
his
present
standards
of
value
five
pounds
seemed
a
very
large
sum
think
of
what
one
could
do
with
it
his
boots
which
had
been
twice
repaired
would
not
decently
serve
him
much
longer
his
trousers
were
in
the
last
stage
of
presentability
the
hat
he
wore
how
carefully
tended
was
the
same
in
which
he
had
come
to
london
three
years
ago
he
stood
in
need
verily
of
a
new
equipment
from
head
to
foot
and
in
islington
five
pounds
would
more
than
cover
the
whole
expense
when
pray
was
he
likely
to
have
such
a
sum
at
his
free
disposal
he
sighed
deeply
and
stared
about
him
in
the
dusk
the
cheque
was
crossed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
tymperley
perceived
that
the
crossing
of
a
cheque
may
occasion
its
recipient
a
great
deal
of
trouble
how
was
he
to
get
it
changed
he
knew
his
landlord
for
a
suspicious
curmudgeon
and
refusal
of
the
favour
with
such
a
look
as
suggs
knew
how
to
give
would
be
a
sore
humiliation
besides
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
suggs
could
make
any
use
of
the
cheque
himself
to
whom
else
could
he
apply
literally
to
no
one
in
london
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
answer
weare
letter
he
lit
his
lamp
and
sat
down
at
the
crazy
little
deal
table
but
his
pen
dipped
several
times
into
the
ink
before
he
found
himself
able
to
write
weare
then
so
long
a
pause
that
he
seemed
to
be
falling
asleep
with
a
jerk
he
bent
again
to
his
task
sincere
gratitude
i
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
most
kind
and
generous
donation
the
money
again
his
hand
lay
idle
for
several
minutes
be
used
as
you
wish
and
i
will
render
to
you
a
detailed
account
of
the
benefits
conferred
by
it
never
had
he
found
composition
so
difficult
he
felt
that
he
was
expressing
himself
wretchedly
a
clog
was
on
his
brain
it
cost
him
an
exertion
of
physical
strength
to
conclude
the
letter
when
it
was
done
he
went
out
purchased
a
stamp
at
a
tobacconist
shop
and
dropped
the
envelope
into
the
post
little
slumber
had
tymperley
that
night
on
lying
down
he
began
to
wonder
where
he
should
find
the
poor
people
worthy
of
sharing
in
this
benefaction
of
course
he
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
class
of
persons
of
whom
weare
was
thinking
in
a
sense
all
the
families
round
about
were
poor
but
he
asked
himself
had
poverty
the
same
meaning
for
them
as
for
him
was
there
a
man
or
woman
in
this
grimy
street
who
compared
with
himself
had
any
right
to
be
called
poor
at
all
an
educated
man
forced
to
live
among
the
lower
classes
arrives
at
many
interesting
conclusions
with
regard
to
them
one
conclusion
long
since
fixed
in
tymperley
mind
was
that
the
of
those
classes
is
very
much
exaggerated
by
outsiders
using
a
criterion
quite
inapplicable
he
saw
around
him
a
world
of
coarse
jollity
of
contented
labour
and
of
brutal
apathy
it
seemed
to
him
more
than
probable
that
the
only
person
in
this
street
conscious
of
poverty
and
suffering
under
it
was
himself
from
nightmarish
dozing
he
started
with
a
vivid
thought
a
recollection
which
seemed
to
pierce
his
brain
to
whom
did
he
owe
his
fall
from
comfort
and
and
all
his
long
miseries
to
weare
father
and
from
this
point
of
view
might
the
cheque
for
five
pounds
be
considered
as
mere
restitution
might
it
not
strictly
be
applicable
to
his
own
necessities
another
little
gap
of
led
to
another
strange
reflection
what
if
weare
a
sensible
woman
suspected
or
even
had
discovered
the
truth
about
him
what
if
she
secretly
the
money
for
his
own
use
earliest
daylight
made
this
suggestion
look
very
insubstantial
on
the
other
hand
it
strengthened
his
memory
of
charman
virtual
indebtedness
to
him
he
jumped
out
of
bed
to
reach
the
cheque
and
for
an
hour
lay
with
it
in
his
hand
then
he
rose
and
dressed
mechanically
after
the
day
work
he
rambled
in
a
street
of
large
shops
a
arrested
him
he
stood
before
the
window
for
a
long
time
turning
over
and
over
in
his
pocket
a
sovereign
no
small
fraction
of
the
ready
coin
which
had
to
support
him
until
dividend
day
then
he
crossed
the
threshold
never
did
man
use
less
discretion
in
the
purchase
of
a
pair
of
boots
his
business
was
transacted
in
a
dream
he
spoke
without
hearing
what
he
said
he
stared
at
objects
without
perceiving
them
the
result
was
that
not
till
he
had
got
home
with
his
easy
old
footgear
under
his
arm
did
he
become
aware
that
the
new
boots
pinched
him
most
horribly
they
creaked
too
heavens
how
they
creaked
but
doubtless
all
new
boots
had
these
faults
he
had
forgotten
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
bought
a
pair
the
fact
was
he
felt
dreadfully
tired
utterly
worn
out
after
munching
a
mouthful
of
supper
he
crept
into
bed
all
night
long
he
warred
with
his
new
boots
footsore
he
limped
about
the
streets
of
a
spectral
city
where
at
every
corner
some
one
seemed
to
lie
in
ambush
for
him
and
each
time
the
lurking
enemy
proved
to
be
no
other
than
weare
who
gazed
at
him
with
scornful
eyes
and
let
him
totter
by
the
creaking
of
the
boots
was
an
articulate
voice
which
ever
and
anon
screamed
at
him
a
terrible
name
he
shrank
and
shivered
and
groaned
but
on
he
went
for
in
his
hand
he
held
a
crossed
cheque
which
he
was
bidden
to
get
changed
and
no
one
would
change
it
what
a
night
when
he
woke
his
brain
was
heavy
as
lead
but
his
meditations
were
very
lucid
pray
what
did
he
mean
by
that
insane
outlay
of
money
which
he
could
not
possibly
afford
on
a
new
and
detestable
pair
of
boots
the
old
would
have
lasted
at
all
events
till
winter
began
what
was
in
his
mind
when
he
entered
the
shop
did
he
intend
merciful
powers
tymperley
was
not
much
of
a
psychologist
but
all
at
once
he
saw
with
awful
perspicacity
the
moral
crisis
through
which
he
had
been
living
and
it
taught
him
one
more
truth
on
the
subject
of
poverty
immediately
after
his
breakfast
he
went
downstairs
and
tapped
at
the
door
of
suggs
is
it
asked
the
bookbinder
who
was
eating
his
fourth
large
rasher
and
spoke
with
his
mouth
full
i
beg
leave
of
absence
for
an
hour
or
two
this
morning
business
of
some
moment
demands
my
attention
suggs
answered
with
the
grace
natural
to
his
order
you
can
do
as
you
like
i
do
pay
you
nothing
the
other
bowed
and
withdrew
two
days
later
he
again
penned
a
letter
to
weare
it
ran
thus
money
which
you
so
kindly
sent
and
which
i
have
already
acknowledged
has
now
been
distributed
to
ensure
a
proper
use
of
it
i
handed
the
cheque
with
clear
instructions
to
a
clergyman
in
this
neighbourhood
who
has
been
so
good
as
to
jot
down
on
the
sheet
enclosed
a
memorandum
of
his
beneficiaries
which
i
trust
will
be
satisfactory
and
gratifying
to
you
why
you
will
ask
did
i
have
recourse
to
a
clergyman
why
did
i
not
use
my
own
experience
and
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
helping
poor
souls
in
whom
i
have
a
personal
interest

who
have
devoted
my
life
to
this
mission
of

is

and
plain
i

place

free
will

no
i
was
merely
a
poor
gentleman
who
on
a
certain
day
found
that
he
had
wasted
his
substance
in
a
foolish
speculation
and
who
ashamed
to
take
his
friends
into
his
confidence
fled
to
a
life
of
miserable
obscurity
you
see
that
i
have
added
disgrace
to
misfortune
i
will
not
tell
you
how
very
near
i
came
to
something
still
worse

been
serving
an
apprenticeship
to
a
certain
handicraft
which
will
i
doubt
not
enable
me
so
to
supplement
my
own
scanty
resources
that
i
shall
be
in
better
circum
than

you
to
forgive

miss
rodney
leisure
a
young
woman
of
about
in
costume
with
unadorned
hat
of
brown
felt
and
irreproachable
umbrella
a
young
woman
who
walked
faster
than
any
one
in
wattleborough
yet
never
looked
hurried
who
crossed
a
muddy
street
seemingly
without
a
thought
for
her
skirts
yet
somehow
was
never
splashed
who
held
up
her
head
like
one
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
world
and
frequently
smiled
at
her
own
thoughts
those
who
did
not
know
her
asked
who
she
was
those
who
had
already
made
her
acquaintance
talked
a
good
deal
of
the
new
mistress
at
the
high
school
by
name
miss
rodney
in
less
than
a
week
after
her
arrival
in
the
town
her
opinions
were
cited
and
discussed
by
wattleborough
ladies
she
brought
with
her
the
air
of
a
university
she
knew
a
great
number
of
important
people
she
had
a
quiet
decision
of
speech
and
manner
which
was
found
very
impressive
in
wattleborough
the
headmistress
spoke
of
her
in
high
terms
and
the
incumbent
of
luke
who
knew
her
family
reported
that
she
had
always
been
remarkably
clever
a
stranger
in
the
town
miss
rodney
was
recommended
to
the
lodgings
of
ducker
a
churchwarden
widow
but
there
she
remained
only
for
a
week
or
two
and
it
was
understood
that
she
left
because
the
rooms
character
some
persons
understood
this
as
an
imputation
on
ducker
and
were
astonished
others
who
caught
a
glimpse
of
miss
rodney
meaning
thought
she
must
be
her
final
choice
of
an
abode
gave
general
surprise
for
though
the
street
was
one
of
those
which
wattleborough
opinion
classed
as
the
house
itself
as
miss
rodney
might
have
learnt
from
the
incumbent
of
luke
in
whose
parish
it
was
situated
had
objectionable
features
nothing
grave
could
be
alleged
against
turpin
who
regularly
attended
the
sunday
evening
service
but
her
husband
a
carpenter
spent
far
too
much
time
at
swan
with
two
necks
and
then
there
was
a
lodger
young
rawcliffe
concerning
whom
wattleborough
had
for
some
time
been
too
well
informed
of
such
comments
upon
her
proceeding
miss
rodney
made
light
in
the
aspect
of
the
rooms
she
found
a
certain
which
decidedly
pleased
her
as
for
grundy
she
added
which
certain
ladies
of
culture
declared
to
be
a
polite
expression
of
contempt
miss
rodney
never
wasted
time
and
in
matters
of
business
had
cultivated
a
notable
brevity
her
interview
with
turpin
when
she
engaged
the
rooms
occupied
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
that
space
of
time
she
had
sufficiently
surveyed
the
house
had
learnt
all
that
seemed
necessary
as
to
its
occupants
and
had
stated
in
the
clearest
possible
way
her
present
requirements
a
matter
of
course
was
her
closing
remark
rooms
will
be
thoroughly
cleaned
before
i
come
in
at
present
they
are
filthy
the
landlady
was
too
much
astonished
to
reply
miss
rodney
tones
and
bearing
had
so
impressed
her
that
she
was
at
a
loss
for
her
usual
loquacity
and
could
only
stammer
respectfully
broken
answers
to
whatever
was
asked
assuredly
no
one
had
ever
dared
to
tell
her
that
her
lodgings
were
any
ordinary
person
who
had
ventured
upon
such
an
insult
would
have
been
overwhelmed
with
clamorous
retort
but
miss
rodney
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
nod
went
her
way
and
turpin
stood
at
the
open
door
gazing
after
her
bewildered
satisfaction
and
resentment
she
was
an
creature
not
but
sometimes
mendacious
and
very
indolent
her
life
had
always
been
what
it
was
now
one
of
slatternly
comfort
and
daylong
gossip
for
she
came
of
a
small
tradesman
family
and
had
married
an
artisan
who
was
always
in
work
her
children
were
two
daughters
who
at
seventeen
and
fifteen
remained
in
the
house
with
her
doing
little
or
nothing
though
they
were
supposed
to
upon
the
lodgers
for
some
months
only
two
of
the
four
rooms
turpin
was
able
to
let
had
been
occupied
one
by
rawcliffe
always
so
called
though
his
age
was
nearly
thirty
but
as
was
well
known
he
belonged
to
the
gentry
and
turpin
held
him
in
reverence
on
that
account
no
matter
for
his
little
weaknesses
of
which
evil
tongues
said
turpin
of
course
made
the
most
he
might
be
irregular
in
payment
he
might
come
home
all
hours
and
make
unnecessary
noise
in
going
upstairs
he
might
at
times
grumble
when
his
chop
was
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
might
occasionally
be
little
too
free
with
the
young
ladies
that
is
to
say
with
mabel
and
lily
turpin
but
all
these
things
were
forgiven
him
because
he
was
real
gentleman
and
spent
just
as
little
time
as
he
liked
daily
in
a
solicitor
office
miss
rodney
arrived
early
on
saturday
afternoon
smiling
and
silent
she
saw
her
luggage
taken
up
to
the
bedroom
she
paid
the
cabman
she
beckoned
her
landlady
into
the
parlour
which
was
on
the
front
have
had
time
yet
turpin
to
clean
the
rooms
the
landlady
stammered
a
surprise
why
she
and
her
daughters
had
given
the
room
a
thorough
turn
out
it
was
done
only
yesterday
and
had
been
devoted
to
it
see
interrupted
miss
rodney
with
quiet
decision
our
notions
of
cleanliness
differ
considerably
i
going
out
now
and
i
shall
not
be
back
till
six
you
will
please
to
the
bedroom
before
then
the
shall
be
done
on
monday
and
therewith
miss
rodney
left
the
house
on
her
return
she
found
the
bedroom
relatively
clean
and
knowing
that
too
much
must
not
be
expected
at
once
she
made
no
comment
that
night
as
she
sat
reading
at
eleven
a
strange
sound
arose
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
it
was
a
man
voice
hilariously
mirthful
and
breaking
into
rude
song
after
listening
for
a
few
minutes
miss
rodney
rang
her
bell
and
the
landlady
appeared
voice
is
that
i
hear
miss
is
shouting
and
singing
asked
miss
rodney
in
a
disinterested
tone
sorry
if
it
disturbs
you
miss
you
hear
no
more
turpin
i
asked
who
it
was
miss
but
you
good
night
mrs
turpin
there
was
quiet
for
an
hour
or
more
at
something
after
midnight
when
miss
rodney
had
just
finished
writing
half
a
dozen
letters
there
sounded
a
in
the
front
door
and
some
one
entered
this
person
whoever
it
was
seemed
to
stumble
about
the
passage
in
the
dark
and
at
length
banged
against
the
listener
door
miss
rodney
started
up
and
flung
the
door
open
by
the
light
of
her
lamp
she
saw
a
moustachioed
face
highly
flushed
and
grinning
pardon
cried
the
man
in
a
voice
which
harmonised
with
his
look
and
bearing
dark
here
have
got
a
match
miss
pardon
forgotten
the
name
new
lodger
oblige
me
with
a
light
thanks
awfully
without
a
word
miss
rodney
took
a
from
her
entered
the
passage
entered
the
second
parlour
that
occupied
by
rawcliffe
and
lit
a
candle
which
stood
on
the
table
be
so
kind
she
said
looking
her
in
the
eyes
not
to
set
the
house
on
fire
no
fear
he
replied
with
a
high
laugh
accustomed
thanks
awfully
miss
pardon
forgotten
the
name
but
miss
rodney
was
back
in
her
and
had
closed
the
door
her
breakfast
next
morning
was
served
by
mabel
turpin
the
elder
daughter
a
stupidly
girl
who
would
fain
have
entered
into
conversation
miss
rodney
replied
to
a
question
that
she
had
slept
well
and
added
that
when
she
rang
her
bell
she
would
like
to
see
turpin
twenty
minutes
later
the
landlady
entered
wanted
me
miss
she
began
in
what
was
meant
for
a
voice
of
dignity
and
reserve
do
really
wait
on
lodgers
myself
talk
about
that
another
time
turpin
i
wanted
to
say
first
of
all
that
you
have
spoiled
a
piece
of
good
bacon
and
two
good
eggs
i
must
trouble
you
to
cook
better
than
this
very
sorry
miss
that
nothing
seems
to
suit
we
shall
get
right
in
time
interrupted
miss
rodney
cheerfully
will
find
that
i
have
patience
then
i
wanted
to
ask
you
whether
your
husband
and
your
lodger
come
home
tipsy
night
or
only
on
saturdays
the
woman
opened
her
eyes
as
wide
as
saucers
trying
hard
to
look
indignant
miss
perhaps
i
should
have
said
drunk
i
beg
your
pardon
i
can
say
miss
is
that
young
rawcliffe
has
never
behaved
himself
in
house
excepting
as
the
gentleman
he
is
you
do
perhaps
know
that
he
belongs
to
a
very
family
miss
or
i
sure
you
see
interposed
miss
rodney
accounts
for
it
but
your
husband
is
highly
connected
sure
miss
nobody
could
ever
say
that
my
took
too
much
not
to
say
too
much
you
may
have
heard
him
a
bit
merry
miss
but
where
the
harm
of
a
saturday
night
you
then
it
is
only
on
saturday
nights
that
turpin
becomes
merry
i
glad
to
know
that
i
shall
get
used
to
these
little
things
but
turpin
did
not
feel
sure
that
she
would
get
used
to
her
lodger
sunday
was
spoilt
for
her
by
this
beginning
when
her
husband
woke
from
his
prolonged
slumbers
and
shouted
for
breakfast
which
on
this
day
of
rest
he
always
took
in
bed
the
good
woman
went
to
him
with
downcast
visage
and
spoke
querulously
of
miss
rodney
behaviour
wait
upon
her
so
there
the
girls
may
do
it
and
if
she
satisfied
let
her
give
notice
i
sure
i
sha
be
sorry
she
given
me
more
trouble
in
a
day
than
poor
brown
did
all
the
months
she
was
here
i
be
at
her
beck
and
call
so
there
before
night
came
this
declaration
was
repeated
times
innumerable
and
as
it
happened
that
miss
rodney
made
no
demand
for
her
landlady
attendance
the
good
woman
enjoyed
a
sense
of
triumphant
on
monday
morning
mabel
took
in
the
breakfast
and
reported
that
miss
rodney
had
made
no
remark
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
bell
rang
and
turpin
was
summoned
very
red
in
the
face
she
obeyed
having
civilly
greeted
her
miss
rodney
inquired
at
what
hour
turpin
took
his
breakfast
and
was
answered
with
an
air
of
surprise
that
he
always
left
the
house
on
at
seven
that
case
said
miss
rodney
will
ask
permission
to
come
into
your
kitchen
at
a
quarter
to
eight
morning
to
show
you
how
to
fry
bacon
and
boil
eggs
you
must
mind
you
know
that
teaching
is
my
profession
turpin
nevertheless
seemed
to
mind
very
much
her
generally
face
wore
a
dogged
sullenness
and
she
began
to
mutter
something
about
such
a
thing
never
having
been
heard
of
but
miss
rodney
paid
no
heed
renewed
the
appointment
for
the
next
morning
and
waved
a
cheerful
dismissal
talking
with
a
friend
that
day
the
high
school
mistress
gave
a
humorous
description
of
her
lodgings
and
when
the
friend
remarked
that
they
must
be
very
uncomfortable
and
that
surely
she
would
not
stay
there
miss
rodney
replied
that
she
had
the
firmest
intention
of
staying
and
what
was
more
of
being
comfortable
going
to
take
that
household
in
hand
she
added
woman
is
foolish
but
can
be
managed
i
think
with
a
little
patience
i
going
to
the
drunken
husband
as
soon
as
i
see
my
way
and
as
for
the
highly
connected
gentleman
whose
candle
i
had
the
honour
of
lighting
i
shall
turn
him
out
have
your
work
set
exclaimed
the
friend
laughing
a
little
employment
for
my
leisure
this
kind
of
thing
relieves
the
monotony
of
a
teacher
life
and
prevents
one
from
growing
old
very
systematically
she
pursued
her
purpose
of
getting
turpin
hand
the
two
points
at
which
she
first
aimed
were
the
keeping
clean
of
her
room
and
the
decent
preparation
of
her
meals
never
losing
temper
never
seeming
to
notice
the
landlady
sullen
mood
always
using
a
tone
of
legitimate
authority
touched
sometimes
with
humorous
compassion
she
exacted
obedience
to
her
directions
but
was
well
aware
that
at
any
moment
the
burden
of
a
new
civilisation
might
prove
too
heavy
for
the
turpin
family
and
cause
revolt
a
week
went
by
it
was
again
saturday
and
miss
rodney
devoted
a
part
of
the
morning
there
being
no
school
to
culinary
instruction
mabel
and
lily
shared
the
lesson
with
their
mother
but
both
young
ladies
wore
an
air
of
condescension
and
grimaced
at
miss
rodney
behind
her
back
turpin
was
obstinately
mute
the
pride
of
ignorance
stiffened
her
backbone
and
curled
her
lip
miss
rodney
leisure
generally
had
its
task
though
as
a
matter
of
principle
she
took
daily
exercise
her
walking
or
cycling
was
always
an
opportunity
for
thinking
something
out
and
this
afternoon
as
she
sped
on
wheels
some
ten
miles
from
wattleborough
her
mind
was
busy
with
the
problem
of
turpin
husband
from
her
clerical
friend
of
she
had
learnt
that
turpin
was
at
bottom
a
decent
sort
of
man
rather
intelligent
and
that
it
was
only
during
the
last
year
or
two
that
he
had
taken
to
passing
his
evenings
at
the
causes
for
this
decline
could
be
suggested
the
carpenter
had
lost
his
only
son
a
lad
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
the
boy
death
quite
broke
him
down
at
the
time
and
perhaps
he
had
begun
to
drink
as
a
way
for
forgetting
his
trouble
perhaps
too
his
foolish
slatternly
wife
bore
part
of
the
blame
for
his
home
had
always
been
comfortless
and
such
companionship
must
in
the
tell
on
a
man
reflecting
upon
this
miss
rodney
had
an
idea
and
she
took
no
time
in
putting
it
into
practice
when
mabel
brought
in
her
tea
she
asked
the
girl
whether
her
father
was
at
home
think
he
is
miss
was
the
distant
reply
for
mabel
had
been
bidden
by
her
mother
to
a
proper
spirit
when
miss
rodney
addressed
her
think
so
will
you
please
make
sure
and
if
you
are
right
ask
turpin
to
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
have
a
word
with
him
startled
and
puzzled
the
girl
left
the
room
miss
rodney
waited
but
no
one
came
when
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
she
rang
the
bell
a
few
minutes
more
and
there
sounded
a
heavy
foot
in
the
passage
then
a
heavy
knock
at
the
door
and
turpin
presented
himself
he
was
a
short
sturdy
man
with
hair
and
beard
of
the
hue
known
as
ginger
and
a
face
which
told
in
his
favour
vicious
he
could
assuredly
not
be
with
those
honest
grey
eyes
but
one
easily
imagined
him
weak
in
character
and
his
attitude
as
he
stood
just
within
the
room
half
respectful
half
assertive
betrayed
an
embarrassment
altogether
encouraging
to
miss
rodney
in
her
pleasantest
tone
she
begged
him
to
be
seated
you
miss
he
replied
in
a
deep
voice
which
sounded
huskily
but
had
nothing
of
surliness
suppose
you
want
to
complain
about
something
and
i
rather
get
it
over
standing
was
not
going
to
make
any
complaint
mr
turpin
glad
to
hear
it
miss
for
my
wife
wished
me
to
say
she
done
about
all
she
could
and
if
things
were
to
your
liking
she
thought
it
would
be
best
for
all
if
you
suited
yourself
in
somebody
else
lodgings
it
evidently
cost
the
man
no
little
effort
to
deliver
his
message
there
was
a
nervous
twitching
about
his
person
and
he
could
not
look
miss
rodney
straight
in
the
face
she
observant
of
this
kept
a
very
steady
eye
on
him
and
spoke
with
all
possible
calmness
have
not
the
least
desire
to
change
my
lodgings
turpin
things
are
going
on
quite
well
there
is
an
improvement
in
the
cooking
in
the
cleaning
in
everything
and
with
a
little
patience
i
am
sure
we
shall
all
come
to
understand
one
another
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
was
a
little
practical
matter
in
which
you
may
be
able
to
help
me
i
teach
mathematics
at
the
high
school
and
i
have
an
idea
that
i
might
make
certain
points
in
geometry
easier
to
my
younger
girls
if
i
could
demonstrate
them
in
a
mechanical
way
pray
look
here
you
see
the
shapes
i
have
sketched
on
this
piece
of
paper
do
you
think
you
could
make
them
for
me
in
wood
the
carpenter
was
moved
to
a
show
of
reluctant
interest
he
took
the
paper
balanced
himself
now
on
one
leg
now
on
the
other
and
said
at
length
that
he
thought
he
saw
what
was
wanted
miss
rodney
coming
to
his
side
explained
in
more
detail
his
interest
grew
more
active
euclid
miss
be
sure
do
you
remember
your
euclid
own
schooling
never
went
as
far
as
that
he
replied
in
a
muttering
voice
my
harry
used
to
do
euclid
at
the
grammar
school
and
i
got
into
a
sort
of
way
of
doing
it
with
him
miss
rodney
kept
a
moment
silence
then
quietly
and
kindly
she
asked
one
or
two
questions
about
the
boy
who
had
died
the
father
answered
in
an
awkward
confused
way
as
if
speaking
only
by
constraint
i
see
what
i
can
do
miss
he
added
abruptly
folding
the
paper
to
take
away
like
them
soon
i
was
going
to
ask
you
turpin
whether
you
could
do
them
this
evening
then
i
should
have
them
for
monday
morning
turpin
hesitated
shuffled
his
feet
and
seemed
to
reflect
uneasily
but
he
said
at
length
that
he
see
about
it
and
with
a
rough
bow
got
out
of
the
room
that
night
no
hilarious
sounds
came
from
the
kitchen
on
sunday
morning
when
miss
rodney
went
into
her
she
found
on
the
table
the
wooden
geometrical
forms
excellently
made
just
as
she
wished
mabel
who
came
with
breakfast
was
bidden
to
thank
her
father
and
to
say
that
miss
rodney
would
like
to
speak
with
him
again
if
his
leisure
allowed
after
on
monday
at
that
hour
the
carpenter
did
not
fail
to
present
himself
distrustful
still
but
less
embarrassed
miss
rodney
praised
his
work
and
desired
to
pay
for
it
oh
that
was
worth
talking
about
said
turpin
but
the
lady
insisted
and
money
changed
hands
this
piece
of
business
transacted
miss
rodney
produced
a
euclid
and
asked
turpin
to
show
her
how
far
he
had
gone
in
it
with
his
boy
harry
the
subject
proved
fruitful
of
conversation
it
became
evident
that
the
carpenter
had
a
mathematical
bias
and
could
be
readily
interested
in
such
things
as
geometrical
problems
why
should
he
not
take
up
the
subject
again
miss
replied
turpin
speaking
at
length
quite
naturally
should
have
the
heart
if
my
harry
had
but
miss
rodney
stuck
to
the
point
and
succeeded
in
making
him
promise
that
he
would
get
out
the
old
euclid
and
have
a
look
at
it
in
his
leisure
time
as
he
withdrew
the
man
had
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
honest
face
on
the
next
saturday
evening
the
house
was
again
quiet
meanwhile
relations
between
turpin
and
her
lodger
were
becoming
less
strained
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
flabby
foolish
woman
had
to
do
with
a
person
of
firm
will
and
bright
intelligence
not
being
vicious
of
temper
she
necessarily
felt
herself
submitting
to
domination
and
darkly
surmised
that
the
rule
might
in
some
way
be
for
her
good
all
the
sluggard
and
the
slattern
in
her
all
the
obstinacy
of
lifelong
habits
hung
back
from
the
new
things
which
miss
rodney
was
forcing
upon
her
acceptance
but
she
was
no
longer
moved
by
active
resentment
to
be
told
that
she
cooked
badly
had
long
ceased
to
be
an
insult
and
was
becoming
merely
a
worrying
truism
that
she
lived
in
dirt
there
seemed
no
way
of
denying
and
though
every
muscle
groaned
she
began
to
look
upon
the
physical
exertion
of
dusting
and
scrubbing
as
part
of
her
lot
in
life
why
she
submitted
turpin
could
not
have
told
you
and
as
was
presently
to
be
seen
there
were
regions
of
her
mind
still
unconquered
instincts
of
resistance
which
yet
had
to
come
into
play
for
during
all
this
time
miss
rodney
had
had
her
eye
on
her
rawcliffe
and
the
more
she
observed
this
gentleman
the
more
resolute
she
became
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
but
it
was
plain
to
her
that
the
undertaking
would
be
no
easy
one
in
the
landlady
eyes
rawcliffe
though
not
perhaps
a
faultless
specimen
of
humanity
conferred
an
honour
on
her
house
by
residing
in
it
the
idea
of
giving
him
notice
to
quit
was
inconceivable
to
her
this
came
out
very
clearly
in
the
first
frank
conversation
which
miss
rodney
held
with
her
on
the
topic
it
happened
that
rawcliffe
had
passed
an
evening
at
home
in
the
company
of
his
friends
after
supping
together
the
gentlemen
indulged
in
merriment
which
towards
midnight
became
uproarious
in
the
morning
turpin
mumbled
a
shamefaced
apology
for
this
disturbance
of
miss
rodney
repose
do
you
take
this
opportunity
and
get
rid
of
him
asked
the
lodger
in
her
tone
miss
it
your
plain
duty
to
do
so
he
gives
your
house
a
bad
character
he
sets
a
bad
example
to
your
husband
he
has
a
bad
influence
on
your
daughters
miss
i
do
so
turpin
you
think
if
you
had
you
would
long
ago
have
noticed
that
his
behaviour
to
those
girls
is
not
at
all
such
as
it
should
be
more
than
once
i
have
chanced
to
hear
bits
of
talk
when
either
mabel
or
lily
was
in
his
and
did
like
the
tone
of
it
in
plain
english
the
man
is
a
blackguard
turpin
gasped
miss
you
forget
what
family
he
belongs
to
be
a
simpleton
turpin
the
blackguard
is
found
in
every
rank
of
life
now
suppose
you
go
to
him
as
soon
as
he
gets
up
and
quietly
give
him
notice
you
no
idea
how
much
better
you
would
feel
after
it
but
turpin
trembled
at
the
suggestion
it
was
evident
that
no
ordinary
argument
or
persuasion
would
bring
her
to
such
a
step
miss
rodney
put
the
matter
aside
for
the
moment
she
had
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
information
about
rawcliffe
it
was
true
that
he
belonged
to
a
family
of
some
esteem
in
the
wattleborough
neighbourhood
but
his
father
had
died
in
embarrassed
circumstances
and
his
mother
was
now
the
wife
of
a
prosperous
merchant
in
another
town
to
his
stepfather
rawcliffe
owed
an
expensive
education
and
two
or
three
starts
in
life
he
was
in
his
second
year
of
articles
to
a
solicitor
but
there
seemed
little
probability
of
his
ever
earning
a
living
by
the
law
and
reports
of
his
excesses
which
reached
the
stepfather
ears
had
begun
to
make
the
young
man
position
decidedly
precarious
the
incumbent
of
luke
whom
rawcliffe
had
more
than
once
insulted
took
much
interest
in
miss
rodney
design
against
this
common
enemy
he
could
not
himself
take
active
part
in
the
campaign
but
he
never
met
the
high
school
mistress
without
inquiring
what
progress
she
had
made
the
conquest
of
turpin
who
now
for
several
weeks
had
kept
sober
and
spent
his
evenings
in
mathematical
study
was
a
most
encouraging
circumstance
but
miss
rodney
had
no
thought
of
using
her
influence
over
her
landlady
husband
to
assail
rawcliffe
position
she
would
rely
upon
herself
alone
in
this
as
in
all
other
undertakings
only
by
constant
watchfulness
and
energy
did
she
maintain
her
control
over
turpin
who
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
relapse
into
her
old
slatternly
ways
it
was
not
enough
to
hold
the
ground
that
had
been
gained
there
must
be
progressive
conquest
and
to
this
end
miss
rodney
one
day
broached
a
subject
which
had
already
been
discussed
between
her
and
her
clerical
ally
do
you
keep
both
your
girls
at
home
mrs
turpin
she
asked
should
i
do
with
them
miss
i
do
hold
with
sending
girls
into
shops
or
else
they
an
aunt
in
birmingham
who
manageress
of
is
my
idea
interposed
miss
rodney
quietly
have
been
asked
if
i
knew
of
a
girl
who
would
go
into
a
not
far
from
here
as
second
housemaid
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
lily
a
sound
of
indignant
protest
escaped
the
landlady
which
miss
rodney
steadily
regarding
her
purposely
misinterpreted
no
of
course
she
is
not
really
capable
of
taking
such
a
position
but
the
lady
of
whom
i
am
speaking
would
not
mind
an
untrained
girl
who
came
from
a
decent
house
is
it
worth
thinking
of
turpin
was
red
with
suppressed
indignation
but
as
usual
she
could
not
look
her
lodger
defiantly
in
the
face
not
so
poor
miss
she
exclaimed
we
need
send
our
daughters
into
service
of
course
not
turpin
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
lily
might
suit
this
lady
but
here
was
another
rock
of
resistance
which
promised
to
give
miss
rodney
a
good
deal
of
trouble
the
landlady
pride
was
outraged
and
after
the
manner
of
the
inarticulate
she
could
think
of
no
adequate
reply
save
that
which
took
the
form
of
personal
abuse
restrained
from
this
by
more
than
one
consideration
she
stood
voiceless
her
bosom
heaving
you
shall
think
it
over
said
miss
rodney
we
speak
of
it
again
in
a
day
or
two
turpin
without
another
word
took
herself
out
of
the
room
save
for
that
singular
meeting
on
miss
rodney
first
night
in
the
house
rawcliffe
and
the
energetic
lady
had
held
no
intercourse
whatever
their
parlours
being
opposite
each
other
on
the
ground
floor
they
necessarily
came
face
to
face
now
and
then
but
the
high
school
mistress
behaved
as
though
she
saw
no
one
and
the
solicitor
clerk
after
one
or
two
attempts
at
polite
formality
adopted
a
like
demeanour
the
proximity
caused
his
neighbour
a
ceaseless
irritation
of
all
objectionable
types
of
humanity
this
loafing
and
boozing
degenerate
was
to
miss
rodney
perhaps
the
least
endurable
his
mere
countenance
excited
her
animosity
for
feebleness
and
conceit
things
abhorrent
to
her
were
legible
in
every
line
of
the
trivial
features
and
a
full
moustache
evidently
subjected
to
training
served
only
as
emphasis
of
foppish
imbecility
could
beat
him
she
exclaimed
more
than
once
within
herself
overcome
with
contemptuous
wrath
when
she
passed
rawcliffe
and
indeed
had
it
been
possible
to
settle
the
matter
thus
simply
no
doubt
rooms
would
very
soon
have
been
vacant
the
crisis
upon
which
miss
rodney
had
resolved
came
about
quite
unexpectedly
one
sunday
evening
turpin
and
her
daughters
had
gone
as
usual
to
church
the
carpenter
had
gone
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
a
neighbour
and
rawcliffe
believed
himself
alone
in
the
house
but
miss
rodney
was
not
at
church
this
evening
she
had
a
headache
and
after
tea
lay
down
in
her
bedroom
for
a
while
soon
impatient
of
repose
she
got
up
and
went
to
her
parlour
the
door
to
her
surprise
was
partly
open
entering
the
tread
of
her
slippered
feet
was
noiseless
she
beheld
an
astonishing
spectacle
before
her
his
back
turned
to
her
stood
rawcliffe
engaged
in
the
deliberate
perusal
of
a
letter
which
he
had
found
there
for
a
moment
she
observed
him
then
she
spoke
business
have
you
here
rawcliffe
gave
such
a
start
that
he
almost
jumped
from
the
ground
his
face
as
he
put
down
the
letter
and
turned
was
that
of
a
gibbering
idiot
his
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
are
you
doing
in
my
room
demanded
miss
rodney
in
her
severest
tones
really
beg
your
pardon
i
really
beg
suppose
this
is
not
the
first
visit
with
which
you
have
honoured
me
first
indeed
i
assure
you
the
very
first
a
foolish
curiosity
i
really
feel
quite
ashamed
of
myself
i
throw
myself
upon
your
indulgence
the
man
had
become
voluble
he
approached
miss
rodney
smiling
in
a
sickly
way
his
head
bobbing
forward
something
she
replied
you
have
still
the
grace
to
feel
ashamed
well
there
no
need
for
us
to
discuss
this
matter
it
can
have
of
course
only
one
result
morning
you
will
oblige
me
by
giving
notice
to
turpin
a
week
notice
the
house
exclaimed
rawcliffe
saturday
next
or
as
much
sooner
as
you
like
but
really
you
please
said
miss
rodney
looking
him
sternly
in
the
face
that
case
i
complain
to
the
landlady
of
your
behaviour
and
insist
on
her
getting
rid
of
you
you
ought
to
have
been
turned
out
long
ago
you
are
a
nuisance
and
worse
than
a
nuisance
be
so
good
as
to
leave
the
room
rawcliffe
his
shoulders
humped
moved
towards
the
door
but
before
reaching
it
he
stopped
and
said
doggedly
give
notice
not
owe
turpin
money
but
you
will
go
all
the
same
a
vicious
light
flashed
into
the
man
eyes
it
comes
to
that
i
shall
go
said
miss
rodney
calmly
and
coldly
will
see
about
it
in
the
meantime
leave
the
room
sir
rawcliffe
nodded
grinned
and
withdrew
late
that
evening
there
was
a
conversation
between
miss
rodney
and
turpin
the
landlady
though
declaring
herself
horrified
at
what
had
happened
did
her
best
to
plead
for
rawcliffe
forgiveness
and
would
not
be
brought
to
the
point
of
promising
to
give
him
notice
well
turpin
said
miss
rodney
at
length
he
leaves
the
house
or
i
do
resolved
as
she
was
to
quit
her
lodgings
this
was
a
bold
declaration
a
meeker
spirit
would
have
trembled
at
the
possibility
that
turpin
might
be
only
too
glad
to
free
herself
from
a
subjection
which
again
and
again
had
all
but
driven
her
to
extremities
but
miss
rodney
had
the
soul
of
a
conqueror
she
saw
only
her
will
and
the
straight
way
to
it
tell
you
the
truth
miss
said
the
landlady
sore
perplexed
rather
backward
with
his
rent
foolish
of
you
to
have
allowed
him
to
get
into
your
debt
the
probability
is
that
he
would
never
pay
his
arrears
they
will
only
increase
the
longer
he
stays
but
i
have
no
more
time
to
spare
at
present
please
understand
that
by
saturday
next
it
must
be
settled
which
of
your
lodgers
is
to
go
turpin
had
never
been
so
worried
the
more
she
thought
of
the
possibility
of
miss
rodney
leaving
the
house
the
less
did
she
like
it
notwithstanding
rawcliffe
it
was
growing
clear
to
her
that
as
a
stamp
of
respectability
and
a
source
of
credit
the
high
school
mistress
was
worth
more
than
the
solicitor
clerk
then
there
was
the
astonishing
change
that
had
come
over
turpin
owing
it
seemed
to
his
talk
with
miss
rodney
the
man
spent
all
his
leisure
time
in
shapes
and
figuring
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
poor
harry
was
at
the
grammar
school
if
miss
rodney
disappeared
it
seemed
only
too
probable
that
turpin
would
be
off
again
to
swan
with
two
necks
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
of
notice
to
rawcliffe
caused
her
something
like
dismay
how
could
she
have
the
face
to
turn
a
real
gentleman
out
of
her
house
yes
but
was
it
not
true
that
she
had
lost
money
by
him
and
stood
to
lose
more
she
had
never
dared
to
tell
her
husband
of
rawcliffe
frequent
shortcomings
in
the
matter
of
weekly
payments
when
the
young
man
smiled
and
nodded
and
said
be
all
right
you
know
turpin
you
can
trust
i
hope
she
could
do
nothing
but
acquiesce
and
rawcliffe
was
more
and
more
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
this
weakness
if
she
could
find
courage
to
go
through
with
the
thing
perhaps
she
would
be
glad
when
it
was
over
three
days
went
by
rawcliffe
led
an
unusually
quiet
and
regular
life
there
came
the
day
on
which
his
weekly
bill
was
presented
turpin
brought
it
in
person
at
breakfast
and
stood
with
it
in
her
hand
an
image
of
vacillation
her
lodger
made
one
of
his
familiar
jokes
she
laughed
feebly
no
the
words
would
not
come
to
her
lips
she
was
physically
incapable
of
giving
him
notice
the
bye
turpin
said
rawcliffe
in
an
offhand
way
as
he
glanced
at
the
bill
much
exactly
do
i
owe
you
pleasantly
agitated
his
landlady
mentioned
the
sum
i
must
settle
that
i
tell
you
what
turpin
let
it
stand
over
for
another
month
and
we
square
things
up
at
christmas
will
that
suit
you
and
by
way
of
encouragement
he
paid
his
week
account
on
the
spot
without
a
penny
of
deduction
turpin
left
the
room
in
greater
embarrassment
than
ever
saturday
came
at
breakfast
miss
rodney
sent
for
the
landlady
who
made
a
timid
appearance
just
within
the
room
morning
turpin
what
news
have
you
for
me
you
know
what
i
mean
the
landlady
took
a
step
forward
and
began
babbling
excuses
explanations
entreaties
she
was
coldly
and
decisively
interrupted
you
turpin
that
will
do
a
week
i
leave
with
a
sound
which
was
half
a
sob
and
half
grunt
turpin
bounced
from
the
room
it
was
now
inevitable
that
she
should
report
the
state
of
things
to
her
husband
and
that
evening
half
an
hour
circumlocution
brought
her
to
the
point
which
of
the
two
lodgers
should
go
the
carpenter
paused
pipe
in
mouth
before
him
a
geometrical
figure
over
which
he
had
puzzled
for
a
day
or
two
and
about
which
if
he
could
find
courage
he
wished
to
consult
the
high
school
mistress
he
reflected
for
five
minutes
and
uttered
an
unhesitating
decision
rawcliffe
must
go
naturally
his
wife
broke
into
indignant
clamour
and
the
debate
lasted
for
an
hour
or
two
but
turpin
could
be
firm
when
he
liked
and
he
had
solid
reasons
for
preferring
to
keep
miss
rodney
in
the
house
at
four
turpin
crept
softly
to
the
where
her
offended
lodger
was
quietly
reading
wanted
just
to
say
miss
that
i
willing
to
give
rawcliffe
notice
next
wednesday
you
turpin
was
the
cold
reply
have
already
taken
other
rooms
the
landlady
gasped
and
for
a
moment
could
say
nothing
then
she
besought
miss
rodney
to
change
her
mind
rawcliffe
should
leave
indeed
he
should
on
wednesday
week
but
miss
rodney
had
only
one
reply
she
had
found
other
rooms
that
suited
her
and
she
requested
to
be
left
in
peace
at
eleven
rawcliffe
came
home
he
was
unnaturally
sober
for
saturday
night
and
found
his
way
into
the
parlour
without
difficulty
there
in
a
minute
or
two
he
was
confronted
by
his
landlady
and
her
husband
they
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
stood
in
a
resolute
attitude
rawcliffe
began
turpin
must
leave
these
lodgings
sir
on
wednesday
next
what
all
this
about
cried
the
other
do
you
mean
turpin
the
carpenter
made
plain
his
meaning
spoke
of
miss
rodney
complaint
of
the
irregular
payment
for
his
wife
in
her
stress
had
avowed
everything
and
of
other
subjects
of
dissatisfaction
the
lodger
must
go
there
was
an
end
of
it
rawcliffe
putting
on
all
his
dignity
demanded
the
legal
notice
turpin
demanded
the
sum
in
arrear
there
was
an
exchange
of
high
words
and
the
interview
ended
with
mutual
defiance
a
moment
after
turpin
and
his
wife
knocked
at
miss
rodney
door
for
she
was
still
in
her
parlour
there
followed
a
brief
conversation
with
the
result
that
miss
rodney
graciously
consented
to
remain
on
the
understanding
that
rawcliffe
left
the
house
not
later
than
wednesday
enraged
at
the
treatment
he
was
receiving
rawcliffe
loudly
declared
that
he
would
not
budge
turpin
warned
him
that
if
he
had
made
no
preparations
for
departure
on
wednesday
he
would
be
forcibly
ejected
and
the
door
closed
against
him
have
the
right
to
do
it
shouted
the
lodger
sue
you
for
damages
i
retorted
the
carpenter
sue
you
for
the
money
you
owe
me
the
end
could
not
be
doubtful
rawcliffe
besides
being
a
poor
creature
knew
very
well
that
it
was
dangerous
for
him
to
get
involved
in
a
scandal
his
stepfather
upon
whom
he
depended
asked
but
a
fair
excuse
for
cutting
him
adrift
and
more
than
one
grave
warning
had
come
from
his
mother
during
the
past
few
months
but
he
enjoyed
a
little
blustering
and
even
at
on
wednesday
his
attitude
was
that
of
contemptuous
defiance
in
vain
had
turpin
tried
to
coax
him
with
maternal
suavity
in
vain
had
mabel
and
lily
when
serving
his
meals
whispered
abuse
of
miss
rodney
and
promised
to
find
some
way
of
getting
rid
of
her
so
that
rawcliffe
might
return
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
his
enemy
in
the
opposite
parlour
he
declared
that
no
of
a
school
teacher
should
get
the
better
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
he
arranged
on
tuesday
evening
to
take
a
couple
of
cheaper
rooms
just
outside
the
town
and
ordered
a
cab
to
come
for
him
at
eleven
next
morning
know
what
the
understanding
is
rawcliffe
said
turpin
putting
his
head
into
the
room
as
the
lodger
sat
at
breakfast
a
man
of
my
word
come
bawling
here
cried
the
other
with
a
face
of
scorn
and
at
noon
the
house
knew
him
no
more
miss
rodney
on
that
same
day
was
able
to
offer
her
landlady
a
new
lodger
she
had
not
spoken
of
this
before
being
resolved
to
triumph
by
mere
force
of
will
next
thing
she
remarked
to
a
friend
when
telling
the
story
to
pack
off
one
of
the
girls
into
service
i
shall
manage
it
by
christmas
and
she
added
with
humorous
complacency
does
one
good
to
be
making
a
sort
of
order
in
one
own
little
corner
of
the
world
a
charming
family
must
be
firm
said
miss
shepperson
to
herself
as
she
poured
out
her
morning
tea
with
tremulous
hand
must
really
be
very
firm
with
them
firmness
was
not
the
most
legible
characteristic
of
miss
physiognomy
a
plain
woman
of
something
more
than
thirty
she
had
gentle
eyes
a
twitching
forehead
and
lips
ever
ready
for
a
sympathetic
smile
her
attire
a
little
shabby
a
little
disorderly
well
became
the
occupant
of
furnished
lodgings
at
twelve
and
sixpence
a
week
in
the
unpretentious
suburb
of
acton
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
hammersmith
draper
at
whose
death
a
few
years
ago
she
had
become
possessed
of
a
small
house
and
an
income
of
forty
pounds
a
year
her
two
elder
sisters
were
comfortably
married
to
london
tradesmen
but
she
did
not
see
very
much
of
them
for
their
ways
were
not
hers
and
miss
shepperson
had
always
been
one
of
those
singular
persons
who
shrink
into
solitude
the
moment
they
feel
ill
at
ease
the
house
which
was
her
property
had
until
of
late
given
her
no
trouble
at
all
it
stood
in
a
quiet
part
of
hammersmith
and
had
long
been
occupied
by
good
tenants
who
paid
their
rent
fifty
pounds
with
exemplary
punctuality
repairs
of
course
would
now
and
then
be
called
for
and
to
that
end
miss
shepperson
carefully
put
aside
a
few
pounds
every
year
unhappily
the
old
tenants
were
at
length
obliged
to
change
their
abode
the
house
stood
empty
for
two
months
it
was
then
taken
on
a
three
lease
by
a
family
named
rymer
really
nice
people
said
miss
shepperson
to
herself
after
her
first
interview
with
them
rymer
was
the
city
rymer
who
had
two
little
girls
lived
only
for
domestic
peace
she
had
been
in
better
circumstances
but
did
not
repine
and
forgot
all
worldly
ambition
in
the
happy
discharge
of
her
wifely
and
maternal
duties
charming
family
was
miss
shepperson
mental
comment
when
at
their
invitation
she
had
called
one
sunday
afternoon
soon
after
they
were
settled
in
the
house
and
on
the
way
home
to
her
lodgings
she
sighed
once
or
twice
thinking
of
rymer
blissful
smile
and
the
two
pretty
children
the
first
quarter
rent
was
duly
paid
but
the
second
brought
no
cheque
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
fortnight
miss
shepperson
wrote
to
make
known
her
ingenuous
fear
that
rymer
letter
might
have
miscarried
at
once
there
came
the
politest
and
friendliest
reply
rymer
wrote
his
wife
was
out
of
town
and
had
been
so
overwhelmed
with
business
that
the
matter
of
the
rent
must
have
altogether
escaped
his
mind
he
would
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
and
the
cheque
should
be
sent
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
a
thousand
apologies
for
this
unpardonable
neglect
still
the
cheque
did
not
come
another
arrived
and
again
no
rent
was
paid
it
was
now
a
month
after
christmas
and
miss
shepperson
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
found
her
accounts
in
serious
disorder
this
morning
she
had
a
letter
from
rymer
the
latest
of
a
dozen
or
so
all
in
the
same
strain
really
feel
quite
ashamed
to
take
up
the
pen
wrote
the
graceful
lady
in
her
delicate
hand
you
think
of
us
i
assure
you
that
never
never
before
did
i
find
myself
in
such
a
situation
indeed
i
should
not
have
the
courage
to
write
at
all
but
that
the
end
of
our
troubles
is
already
in
view
it
is
that
in
a
month
time
rymer
will
be
able
to
send
you
a
cheque
in
complete
discharge
of
his
debt
meanwhile
i
you
to
believe
dear
miss
shepperson
how
very
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
your
most
kind
forbearance
another
page
of
almost
affectionate
protests
closed
with
the
touching
subscription
yours
sincerely
and
gratefully
adelaide
rymer
but
miss
shepperson
had
fallen
into
that
state
of
nervous
agitation
which
impels
to
a
decisive
step
she
foresaw
the
horrors
of
pecuniary
embarrassment
her
faith
in
the
rymers
promises
was
exhausted
this
very
morning
she
would
go
to
see
rymer
lay
before
her
the
plain
facts
of
the
case
and
with
all
firmness
with
unmistakable
resolve
make
known
to
her
that
if
the
arrears
were
not
paid
within
a
month
notice
to
quit
would
be
given
and
the
recovery
of
the
debt
be
sought
by
legal
process
fear
had
made
miss
shepperson
indignant
it
was
wrong
and
cowardly
for
people
such
as
the
rymers
to
behave
in
this
way
to
a
poor
woman
who
had
only
just
enough
to
live
upon
she
felt
sure
that
they
pay
if
they
liked
but
because
she
had
shown
herself
soft
and
patient
they
took
advantage
of
her
she
would
be
firm
very
firm
so
about
ten
miss
shepperson
put
on
her
best
things
and
set
out
for
hammersmith
it
was
a
foggy
drizzly
enervating
day
when
miss
shepperson
found
herself
drawing
near
to
the
house
her
courage
sank
her
heart
throbbed
painfully
and
for
a
moment
she
all
but
stopped
and
turned
thinking
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
put
her
ultimatum
into
writing
yet
there
was
the
house
in
view
and
to
turn
back
would
be
deplorable
weakness
by
word
of
mouth
she
could
so
much
better
depict
the
gravity
of
her
situation
she
forced
herself
onwards
trembling
in
every
nerve
she
rang
the
bell
and
in
a
scarce
audible
gasp
she
asked
for
rymer
a
brief
delay
and
the
servant
admitted
her
rymer
was
in
the
giving
her
elder
child
a
while
the
younger
sitting
in
a
at
the
table
turned
over
a
the
room
was
comfortably
and
prettily
furnished
the
children
were
very
becomingly
dressed
their
mother
a
tall
woman
of
fair
complexion
and
thin
refined
face
with
wandering
eyes
and
a
forehead
rather
deeply
lined
stepped
forward
as
if
in
delight
at
the
unexpected
visit
and
took
miss
shepperson
hand
in
both
her
own
gazing
with
tender
interest
into
her
eyes
kind
of
you
to
have
taken
this
trouble
you
guessed
that
i
really
wished
to
see
you
i
should
have
come
to
you
but
just
at
present
i
find
it
so
difficult
to
get
away
from
home
i
am
housekeeper
nursemaid
and
governess
all
in
one
some
women
would
find
it
rather
a
strain
but
the
dear
tots
are
so
good
so
good
cissy
you
remember
miss
shepperson
of
course
you
do
they
look
a
little
pale
i
afraid
do
you
think
so
after
the
life
they
were
accustomed
to
but
we
wo
talk
about
tots
is
over
for
this
morning
you
ca
go
out
my
poor
dears
look
at
the
horrid
horrid
weather
go
and
sit
by
the
and
sing
rain
rain
go
away
miss
shepperson
followed
the
children
with
her
look
as
they
silently
left
the
room
she
knew
not
how
to
enter
upon
what
she
had
to
say
to
talk
of
the
law
and
use
threats
in
this
atmosphere
of
serene
domesticity
seemed
impossibly
harsh
but
the
necessity
of
broaching
the
disagreeable
subject
was
spared
her
husband
and
i
were
talking
about
you
last
night
began
rymer
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
in
a
tone
of
the
friendliest
confidence
had
an
idea
it
seems
to
me
so
good
i
wonder
whether
it
will
to
you
you
told
me
did
you
not
that
you
live
in
lodgings
and
quite
alone
replied
miss
shepperson
struggling
to
command
her
nerves
and
betraying
uneasy
wonder
it
by
choice
asked
the
lady
with
sympathetic
bending
of
the
head
you
no
relations
in
london
i
ca
help
thinking
you
must
feel
very
lonely
it
was
not
difficult
to
lead
miss
shepperson
to
talk
of
her
circumstances
a
natural
introduction
to
the
announcement
which
she
was
still
resolved
to
make
with
all
firmness
she
narrated
in
outline
the
history
of
her
family
made
known
exactly
how
she
stood
in
pecuniary
matters
and
ended
by
saying
see
rymer
that
i
have
to
live
as
carefully
as
i
can
this
house
is
really
all
i
have
to
depend
upon
and
and
again
she
was
spared
the
unpleasant
utterance
with
an
irresistible
smile
and
laying
her
soft
hand
on
the
visitor
glove
rymer
began
to
reveal
the
happy
thought
which
had
occurred
to
her
in
the
house
there
was
a
spare
room
why
should
not
miss
shepperson
come
and
live
here
live
that
is
to
say
as
a
member
of
the
family
nothing
simpler
than
to
arrange
the
details
of
such
a
plan
which
of
course
must
be
businesslike
though
carried
out
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
goodwill
a
certain
sum
of
money
was
due
to
her
for
rent
suppose
this
were
repaid
in
the
form
of
board
and
lodging
which
might
be
reckoned
at
should
one
say
fifteen
shillings
a
week
at
midsummer
next
an
account
would
be
drawn
up
a
thoroughly
businesslike
way
and
whatever
then
remained
due
to
miss
shepperson
would
be
paid
at
once
after
which
if
the
arrangement
proved
agreeable
to
both
sides
it
might
be
continued
cost
of
board
and
lodging
being
deducted
from
the
rent
and
the
remainder
paid
every
quarter
miss
shepperson
would
thus
have
a
home
a
real
home
with
all
family
comforts
and
rymer
who
was
too
much
occupied
with
house
and
children
to
see
much
society
would
have
the
advantage
of
a
sympathetic
friend
under
her
own
roof
the
good
lady
voice
trembled
with
joyous
eagerness
as
she
unfolded
the
project
and
her
eyes
grew
large
as
she
waited
for
the
response
miss
shepperson
felt
such
astonishment
that
she
could
only
reply
with
incoherencies
an
idea
so
novel
and
so
strange
threw
her
thoughts
into
disorder
she
was
alarmed
by
the
invitation
to
live
with
people
who
were
socially
her
superiors
on
the
other
hand
the
proposal
made
appeal
to
her
natural
inclination
for
domestic
life
it
offered
the
possibility
of
occupation
of
usefulness
moreover
from
the
pecuniary
point
of
view
it
would
be
so
very
advantageous
she
stammered
at
length
when
rymer
had
repeated
the
suggestion
in
words
even
more
gracious
and
alluring
fifteen
shillings
is
so
very
little
for
board
and
lodging
do
let
trouble
you
dear
miss
shepperson
cried
the
other
gaily
a
family
so
little
difference
is
made
by
an
extra
person
i
assure
you
it
is
a
perfectly
businesslike
arrangement
otherwise
my
husband
who
is
prudence
itself
would
never
have
sanctioned
it
as
you
know
we
are
suffering
a
temporary
embarrassment
i
wrote
to
you
yesterday
before
my
husband
return
from
business
when
he
came
home
i
learnt
to
my
dismay
that
it
might
be
rather
than
a
month
before
he
was
able
to
send
you
a
cheque
i
said
oh
i
must
write
again
to
miss
shepperson
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
misleading
her
then
as
we
talked
that
idea
came
to
me
as
i
think
you
will
believe
miss
shepperson
i
am
not
a
scheming
or
a
selfish
woman
never
never
have
i
wronged
any
one
in
my
life
this
proposal
i
can
not
help
feeling
is
as
much
for
your
benefit
as
for
ours
does
it
really
seem
so
to
you
suppose
you
come
up
with
me
and
look
at
the
room
it
is
not
in
perfect
order
but
you
will
see
whether
it
pleases
you
curiosity
allying
itself
with
the
allurement
which
had
begun
to
work
upon
her
feelings
miss
shepperson
timidly
rose
and
followed
her
smiling
guide
upstairs
the
little
spare
room
on
the
second
floor
was
furnished
simply
enough
but
made
such
a
contrast
with
the
bedchamber
in
the
acton
that
the
visitor
could
scarcely
repress
an
exclamation
rymer
was
voluble
with
promise
of
added
comforts
she
interested
herself
in
miss
shepperson
health
and
learnt
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
that
it
seldom
gave
trouble
she
inquired
as
to
miss
shepperson
likings
in
the
matter
of
diet
and
strongly
approved
her
preference
for
a
plain
nutritive
regimen
from
the
spare
room
the
visitor
was
taken
into
all
the
others
and
before
they
went
downstairs
again
rymer
had
begun
to
talk
as
though
the
matter
were
decided
will
stay
and
have
lunch
with
me
she
said
yes
indeed
you
will
i
ca
dream
of
your
going
out
into
this
weather
till
after
lunch
suppose
we
have
the
tots
into
the
again
i
want
them
to
make
friends
with
you
at
once
i
you
love
oh
i
have
known
that
for
a
long
time
miss
shepperson
stayed
to
lunch
she
stayed
to
tea
when
at
length
she
took
her
leave
about
six
the
arrangement
was
complete
in
every
detail
on
this
day
week
she
would
transfer
herself
to
the
rymers
house
and
enter
upon
her
new
life
she
arrived
on
saturday
afternoon
and
was
received
by
the
assembled
family
like
a
very
dear
friend
or
relative
rymer
a
man
polite
with
a
frequent
falsetto
laugh
talked
over
the
teacups
in
the
pleasantest
way
imaginable
not
only
putting
miss
shepperson
at
ease
but
making
her
feel
as
if
her
position
as
a
member
of
the
household
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
his
mere
pronunciation
of
her
name
gave
it
a
dignity
an
importance
quite
new
to
miss
shepperson
ears
he
had
a
way
of
shaping
his
remarks
so
as
to
make
it
appear
that
the
homely
timid
woman
was
if
anything
rather
the
superior
in
rank
and
education
and
that
their
simple
ways
might
now
and
then
cause
her
amusement
even
the
children
seemed
to
do
their
best
to
make
the
newcomer
feel
at
home
cissy
whose
age
was
nine
assiduously
handed
toast
and
cake
with
a
most
engaging
smile
and
little
minnie
not
quite
six
deposited
her
kitten
in
miss
shepperson
lap
saying
prettily
may
stroke
it
whenever
you
like
miss
shepperson
to
be
sure
had
personal
qualities
which
could
not
but
appeal
to
people
of
discernment
her
plain
features
expressed
a
simplicity
and
gentleness
which
more
than
compensated
for
the
lack
of
conventional
grace
in
her
manners
she
spoke
softly
and
with
obvious
frankness
nor
was
there
much
fault
to
find
with
her
phrasing
and
accent
dressed
a
little
more
elegantly
she
would
in
no
way
have
jarred
with
the
tone
of
average
society
if
she
had
not
much
education
she
was
altogether
free
from
pretence
and
the
possession
of
property
which
always
works
very
decidedly
for
good
or
for
evil
saved
her
from
that
excess
of
deference
which
would
have
accentuated
her
social
shortcomings
undistinguished
as
she
might
seem
at
the
first
glance
miss
shepperson
could
not
altogether
be
slighted
by
any
one
who
had
been
in
her
presence
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
in
the
course
of
the
evening
she
found
courage
to
converse
more
freely
giving
her
views
for
instance
on
the
great
servant
question
and
on
other
matters
of
domestic
interest
it
became
clear
to
and
rymer
that
their
landlady
though
a
and
woman
was
by
no
means
to
be
regarded
as
a
person
of
no
account
the
servant
question
was
to
the
front
just
now
as
rymer
explained
in
detail
she
course
kept
two
domestics
but
was
temporarily
making
shift
with
only
one
it
being
so
difficult
to
replace
the
cook
who
had
left
a
week
ago
did
miss
shepperson
know
of
a
cook
a
sensible
trustworthy
woman
for
the
present
rymer
she
confessed
it
with
a
pleasant
little
laugh
had
to
give
an
eye
to
the
dinner
herself
only
hope
you
wo
make
yourself
ill
dear
said
rymer
bending
towards
his
wife
with
a
look
of
solicitude
shepperson
i
beg
you
to
insist
that
she
lies
down
a
little
every
afternoon
she
has
great
nervous
energy
but
is
really
very
strong
you
ca
think
what
a
relief
it
will
be
to
me
all
day
to
know
that
some
one
is
with
her
on
sunday
morning
all
went
to
church
together
for
to
rymer
great
satisfaction
miss
shepperson
was
a
member
of
the
orthodox
community
and
particular
about
observances
meals
were
reduced
to
the
simplest
terms
a
restful
quiet
prevailed
in
the
little
house
in
the
afternoon
while
rymer
reposed
miss
shepperson
read
to
the
children
she
it
was
who
the
servant
being
out
prepared
tea
after
tea
and
rymer
with
many
apologies
left
the
home
together
for
a
couple
of
hours
being
absolutely
obliged
to
pay
a
call
at
some
distance
and
miss
shepperson
again
took
care
of
the
children
till
the
domestic
returned
after
breakfast
the
next
day
it
was
a
very
plain
meal
merely
a
rasher
and
dry
toast
the
lady
of
the
house
chatted
with
her
friend
more
confidentially
than
ever
their
servant
she
said
a
good
girl
but
not
very
robust
naturally
could
not
do
all
the
work
of
the
house
and
by
way
of
helping
rymer
was
accustomed
to
to
her
own
bedroom
really
no
hardship
she
said
in
her
graceful
way
once
you
used
to
it
in
fact
i
think
the
exercise
is
good
for
my
health
but
of
course
i
could
think
of
asking
to
do
the
same
no
doubt
you
will
like
to
have
a
breath
of
air
as
the
sky
seems
clearing
what
could
miss
shepperson
do
but
protest
that
to
put
her
own
room
in
order
was
such
a
trifling
matter
that
they
need
not
speak
of
it
another
moment
rymer
was
confused
vexed
and
wished
she
had
not
said
a
word
but
the
other
made
a
joke
of
these
scruples
do
the
children
go
out
asked
miss
shepperson
you
take
them
yourself
always
almost
always
i
shall
go
out
with
them
for
an
hour
at
eleven
and
yet
she
checked
herself
with
a
look
of
worry
dear
me
i
must
absolutely
go
shopping
and
i
do
so
dislike
to
take
the
tots
in
that
direction
never
mind
the
walk
must
be
put
off
till
the
afternoon
it
rain
but
miss
shepperson
straightway
offered
her
services
she
would
either
shop
or
go
out
with
the
children
whichever
rymer
preferred
the
lady
thought
she
had
better
do
the
shopping
so
her
friend
morning
was
pleasantly
arranged
in
a
day
or
two
things
got
into
a
happy
routine
miss
shepperson
practically
became
nursemaid
with
the
privilege
of
keeping
her
own
bedroom
in
order
and
of
helping
in
a
good
many
little
ways
throughout
the
domestic
day
a
fortnight
elapsed
and
rymer
was
still
unable
to
with
a
cook
though
she
had
visited
or
professed
to
visit
many
and
corresponded
with
many
friends
a
week
after
that
the
subject
of
the
cook
had
somehow
fallen
into
forgetfulness
and
indeed
a
less
charitably
disposed
observer
than
miss
shepperson
might
have
doubted
whether
rymer
had
ever
seriously
meant
to
engage
one
at
all
the
food
served
on
the
family
table
was
of
the
plainest
and
not
always
superabundant
in
quantity
but
the
table
itself
was
tastefully
ordered
and
indeed
no
sort
of
carelessness
appeared
in
any
detail
of
the
household
life
rymer
was
always
busy
and
without
fuss
without
irritation
she
had
a
large
correspondence
but
it
was
not
often
that
people
called
no
guest
was
ever
invited
to
lunch
or
dinner
all
this
while
the
master
of
the
house
kept
regular
hours
leaving
home
at
nine
and
returning
at
seven
if
he
went
out
after
dinner
which
happened
rarely
he
was
always
back
by
eleven
no
more
respectable
man
than
rymer
none
more
more
easily
pleased
more
consistently
polite
and
amiable
that
he
and
his
wife
were
very
fond
of
each
other
appeared
in
all
their
talk
and
behaviour
both
worshipped
the
children
and
in
spite
of
that
trained
them
with
a
considerable
measure
of
good
sense
in
the
evenings
rymer
sometimes
read
aloud
or
he
would
talk
instructively
of
the
affairs
of
the
day
the
more
miss
shepperson
saw
of
her
friends
the
more
she
liked
them
never
had
she
been
the
subject
of
so
much
kind
attention
and
in
no
company
had
she
ever
felt
so
happily
at
ease
time
went
on
and
it
was
near
midsummer
of
late
rymer
had
not
been
very
well
and
once
or
twice
miss
shepperson
fancied
that
her
eyes
showed
traces
of
tears
it
was
but
natural
that
the
guest
often
preoccupied
with
the
thought
of
the
promised
settlement
should
feel
a
little
uneasy
on
june
rymer
chose
a
suitable
moment
and
with
her
most
confidential
air
invited
miss
shepperson
to
an
intimate
chat
want
to
explain
to
you
she
said
rather
cheerfully
than
otherwise
exact
state
of
our
affairs
i
sure
it
will
interest
you
we
have
become
such
good
friends
as
i
knew
we
should
i
shall
be
much
easier
in
mind
when
you
know
exactly
how
we
stand
thereupon
she
spoke
of
a
certain
kinsman
of
her
husband
an
old
and
infirm
man
whose
decease
was
expected
if
not
from
day
to
day
at
all
events
from
week
to
week
the
event
would
have
great
importance
for
them
as
rymer
was
entitled
to
the
reversion
of
several
thousands
of
pounds
held
in
use
by
his
lingering
relative
let
me
ask
you
a
question
pursued
the
lady
in
undertone
husband
is
prepared
to
settle
with
you
he
wishes
to
do
so
for
he
feels
that
your
patience
has
been
most
exemplary
but
as
we
spoke
of
it
last
night
an
idea
came
to
me
i
ca
help
thinking
it
was
a
happy
idea
but
i
wish
to
know
how
it
strikes
you
on
receiving
the
sum
due
to
you
you
will
no
doubt
place
it
in
a
bank
or
in
some
way
invest
it
suppose
now
you
leave
the
money
in
rymer
hands
receiving
his
acknowledgment
and
allowing
him
to
pay
it
with
four
per
cent
interest
when
he
enters
into
possession
of
his
capital
mind
i
only
suggest
this
not
for
a
moment
would
i
put
pressure
upon
you
if
you
have
need
of
the
money
it
shall
be
paid
but
it
struck
me
that
knowing
us
so
well
now
you
might
even
be
glad
of
such
an
investment
as
this
the
event
to
which
we
are
looking
forward
may
happen
very
soon
but
it
be
delayed
how
would
you
like
to
leave
this
money
and
the
sums
to
which
you
will
be
entitled
under
our
arrangements
from
quarter
to
quarter
to
increase
at
compound
interest
let
us
make
a
little
calculation
miss
shepperson
listened
nervously
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
on
the
whole
she
preferred
immediate
payment
but
while
she
struggled
with
her
moral
weakness
rymer
anxiously
reading
her
face
struck
another
note
must
disguise
from
you
that
the
money
though
such
a
small
sum
would
be
useful
to
my
husband
poor
fellow
he
has
been
fighting
against
adversity
for
the
last
year
or
two
and
i
sure
no
man
ever
struggled
more
bravely
you
would
never
think
would
you
that
he
is
often
kept
awake
all
night
by
his
anxieties
as
i
tell
him
he
need
not
really
be
anxious
at
all
for
his
troubles
will
so
soon
come
to
an
end
but
there
is
no
more
honourable
man
living
and
he
worries
at
the
thought
of
owing
money
you
ca
imagine
how
he
worries
then
to
tell
you
a
great
secret
a
change
came
upon
the
speaker
face
her
voice
softened
to
a
whisper
as
she
communicated
a
piece
of
delicate
domestic
news
poor
husband
she
added
can
not
bear
to
think
that
when
it
happens
we
may
be
in
really
straitened
circumstances
and
i
may
suffer
for
lack
of
comforts
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
dear
miss
shepperson
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
you
like
my
idea
he
would
at
once
put
aside
that
money
to
be
ready
for
an
emergency
so
you
see
it
is
in
me
after
all
her
smile
was
very
sweet
do
judge
me
too
severely
what
i
propose
is
as
you
see
really
a
very
good
investment
is
it
not
miss
shepperson
found
it
impossible
to
speak
as
she
wished
and
before
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
she
saw
the
matter
entirely
from
her
point
of
view
she
had
in
truth
no
immediate
need
of
money
and
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
content
she
was
to
do
a
kindness
to
the
rymers
while
at
the
same
time
benefiting
herself
that
very
evening
rymer
prepared
a
legal
document
promising
to
pay
on
demand
the
sum
which
became
due
to
miss
shepperson
with
compound
interest
at
the
rate
of
four
per
cent
while
signing
this
he
gravely
expressed
his
conviction
that
before
michaelmas
the
time
for
payment
would
have
arrived
if
it
were
next
week
he
added
with
a
polite
movement
towards
his
creditor
should
be
not
a
bit
the
less
grateful
to
our
most
kind
friend
but
it
purely
a
matter
of
business
said
miss
shepperson
who
was
always
abashed
by
such
expressions
be
sure
murmured
rymer
us
look
at
it
in
that
light
but
it
sha
prevent
us
from
calling
miss
shepperson
our
dearest
friend
the
homely
woman
blushed
and
felt
happy
towards
the
end
of
autumn
when
the
domestic
crisis
was
very
near
the
servant
declared
herself
ill
and
at
hours
notice
quitted
the
house
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
received
no
wages
for
several
months
the
kindness
with
which
she
was
otherwise
treated
had
kept
her
at
her
post
thus
long
but
she
feared
the
increase
of
work
impending
and
preferred
to
go
off
unpaid
now
for
the
first
time
did
rymer
nerves
give
way
miss
shepperson
found
her
sobbing
by
the
fireside
the
two
children
lamenting
at
such
an
unwonted
spectacle
where
was
a
new
servant
to
be
found
in
a
day
or
two
the
monthly
nurse
would
be
here
and
must
of
course
be
waited
upon
and
what
was
to
become
of
the
children
miss
shepperson
moved
by
the
calamitous
situation
entreated
her
friend
to
leave
everything
to
her
she
would
find
a
servant
somehow
and
meanwhile
would
keep
the
house
going
with
her
own
hands
rymer
sobbed
that
she
was
ashamed
to
allow
such
a
thing
but
the
other
braced
by
a
crisis
displayed
wonderful
activity
and
resource
for
two
days
miss
shepperson
did
all
the
domestic
labour
then
a
maid
of
the
species
known
as
presented
herself
and
none
too
soon
for
that
same
night
there
was
born
to
the
rymers
a
third
daughter
but
troubles
were
by
no
means
over
while
rymer
was
ill
very
ill
indeed
the
new
handmaid
exhibited
a
character
so
eccentric
that
after
nearly
setting
fire
to
the
house
while
in
a
state
of
intoxication
she
had
to
be
got
rid
of
as
speedily
as
possible
miss
shepperson
resolved
that
for
the
present
there
should
be
no
repetition
of
such
disagreeable
things
she
quietly
told
rymer
that
she
felt
quite
able
to
grapple
with
the
situation
herself
cried
the
master
of
the
house
who
after
many
sleepless
nights
and
distracted
days
had
a
haggard
unshorn
face
scarcely
to
be
recognised
can
not
permit
it
i
will
go
then
suddenly
turning
again
to
miss
shepperson
he
grasped
her
hand
called
her
his
dear
friend
and
benefactress
and
with
breaking
voice
whispered
to
her
will
help
you
i
can
do
the
hard
work
it
only
for
a
day
or
two
late
that
evening
he
and
miss
shepperson
were
in
the
kitchen
together
the
one
was
washing
crockery
the
other
who
had
been
filling
stood
with
dirty
hands
and
melancholy
visage
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
their
looks
met
rymer
took
a
step
forward
smiling
with
confidential
sadness
feel
that
i
ought
to
speak
frankly
he
said
in
a
voice
as
polite
and
as
ever
should
like
to
make
known
to
you
the
exact
state
of
my
affairs
but
rymer
has
told
me
everything
replied
miss
shepperson
as
she
dried
a
not
quite
everything
i
afraid
he
had
a
shovel
in
his
hand
and
eyed
it
curiously
has
not
told
you
that
i
am
considerably
in
debt
to
various
people
and
that
not
long
ago
i
was
obliged
to
raise
money
on
our
furniture
miss
shepperson
laid
down
the
and
gazed
anxiously
at
him
whereupon
he
began
a
detailed
story
of
his
misfortunes
in
business
rymer
was
a
that
is
to
say
he
was
everything
and
nothing
struggle
with
pecuniary
embarrassment
was
his
normal
condition
but
only
during
the
last
twelvemonth
had
he
fallen
under
persistent
and
come
to
all
but
the
very
end
of
his
resources
it
would
still
be
possible
for
him
he
explained
to
raise
money
on
the
reversion
for
which
he
was
waiting
but
of
such
a
step
he
could
not
dream
would
be
dishonesty
miss
shepperson
and
how
unfortunate
i
have
never
yet
lost
my
honour
people
have
trusted
me
knowing
that
i
am
an
honest
man
i
belong
to
a
good
family
as
no
doubt
rymer
has
told
you
a
brother
of
mine
holds
a
respected
position
in
birmingham
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
he
will
find
me
employment
but
as
you
can
well
understand
i
shrink
from
that
extremity
for
one
thing
i
am
in
debt
to
my
brother
and
i
am
resolved
to
pay
what
i
owe
him
before
asking
for
any
more
assistance
i
do
not
lose
courage
you
know
the
proverb
lose
heart
lose
all
i
am
blest
with
an
admirable
wife
who
stands
by
me
and
supports
me
under
every
trial
if
my
wife
were
to
die
miss
shepperson
he
faltered
his
eyes
glistened
in
the
gas
no
i
wo
encourage
gloomy
fears
she
is
a
little
better
they
tell
me
we
shall
come
out
of
our
troubles
and
laugh
over
them
by
our
cheerful
fireside
you
with
us
you
our
dearest
and
staunchest
friend
we
must
hope
said
miss
shepperson
reassured
once
more
as
to
her
own
interests
for
a
moment
her
heart
had
sunk
very
low
indeed
are
all
doing
our
best
above
all
said
rymer
pressing
her
hand
with
his
fingers
felt
obliged
to
speak
frankly
because
you
must
have
thought
it
strange
that
i
allowed
things
to
get
so
disorderly
our
domestic
arrangements
i
mean
the
fact
is
miss
shepperson
i
simply
do
know
how
i
am
going
to
meet
the
expenses
of
this
illness
and
i
dread
the
thought
of
engaging
servants
i
can
not
i
will
not
raise
money
on
my
expectations
when
the
money
comes
to
me
i
must
be
able
to
pay
all
my
debts
and
have
enough
left
to
recommence
life
with
do
you
approve
this
resolution
miss
shepperson
yes
indeed
i
do
replied
the
listener
heartily
yet
of
course
he
pursued
his
eyes
wandering
have
a
servant
miss
shepperson
reflected
she
too
with
an
uneasy
look
on
her
face
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
by
a
deep
sigh
from
rymer
a
sigh
which
was
almost
a
sob
the
other
went
on
drying
her
plates
and
dishes
and
said
at
length
that
perhaps
they
might
manage
with
quite
a
young
girl
who
would
come
for
small
wages
she
herself
was
willing
to
help
as
much
as
she
could
you
shame
me
you
shame
me
broke
in
rymer
laying
a
hand
on
his
forehead
and
leaving
a
black
mark
there
is
no
end
to
your
kindness
but
i
feel
it
as
a
disgrace
to
us
to
me
that
you
a
lady
of
property
should
be
working
here
like
a
servant
it
is
monstrous
monstrous
at
the
flattering
description
of
herself
miss
shepperson
smiled
her
soft
eyes
beamed
with
the
light
of
contentment
you
give
a
thought
to
that
rymer
she
exclaimed
it
a
pleasure
to
me
and
it
gives
me
something
to
do
it
good
for
my
health
do
you
worry
think
about
your
business
and
leave
me
to
look
after
the
house
it
be
all
right
a
week
later
rymer
was
in
the
way
of
recovery
and
her
husband
went
to
the
city
as
usual
a
servant
had
been
engaged
a
girl
of
sixteen
who
knew
as
much
of
housework
as
london
girls
of
sixteen
generally
do
at
all
events
she
could
carry
coals
and
wash
steps
but
the
mistress
of
the
house
it
was
evident
would
for
a
long
time
be
unable
to
do
anything
whatever
the
real
was
miss
shepperson
who
rose
every
morning
at
six
and
toiled
in
one
way
or
another
till
weary
bedtime
if
she
left
the
house
it
was
to
do
needful
shopping
or
to
take
the
children
for
a
walk
her
reward
was
the
admiration
and
gratitude
of
the
family
even
little
minnie
had
been
taught
to
say
at
frequent
intervals
love
miss
shepperson
because
she
is
good
the
invalid
behaved
to
her
as
to
a
sister
and
kissed
her
cheek
morning
and
evening
miss
name
being
dora
the
baby
was
to
be
so
called
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
godmother
drew
a
sovereign
from
her
small
savings
to
buy
little
miss
dora
a
christening
present
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
find
a
house
in
london
in
which
there
reigned
so
delightful
a
spirit
of
harmony
and
kindliness
was
so
glad
said
rymer
one
day
to
her
friend
the
day
on
which
she
first
rose
from
bed
my
husband
took
you
into
his
confidence
about
our
affairs
now
you
know
everything
and
it
is
much
better
you
know
that
we
are
very
unlucky
but
that
no
one
can
breathe
a
word
against
our
honour
this
was
the
thought
that
held
me
up
through
my
illness
in
a
very
short
time
all
our
debts
will
be
paid
every
farthing
and
it
will
be
delightful
to
remember
how
we
struggled
and
what
we
endured
to
keep
an
honest
name
though
she
added
tenderly
we
should
have
done
without
i
really
can
not
imagine
we
might
have
sunk
gone
down
for
months
rymer
led
the
life
of
a
feeble
convalescent
she
ought
to
have
had
change
of
air
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
for
business
was
as
unremunerative
as
ever
and
with
difficulty
he
provided
the
household
with
food
one
gleam
of
light
kept
up
the
courage
of
the
family
the
aged
relative
was
known
to
be
so
infirm
that
he
could
only
leave
the
house
in
a
every
day
there
might
be
news
even
yet
more
promising
meanwhile
the
girl
of
sixteen
exercised
her
incompetence
in
the
meaner
departments
of
domestic
life
and
miss
shepperson
did
all
the
work
that
required
care
or
the
duties
of
nursemaid
alone
taking
a
great
deal
of
her
time
on
the
whole
this
employment
seemed
to
suit
her
she
had
a
look
of
improved
health
enjoyed
more
equable
spirits
and
in
her
manner
showed
more
once
a
month
she
succeeded
in
getting
a
few
hours
holiday
and
paid
a
visit
to
one
or
the
other
of
her
sisters
but
to
neither
of
them
did
she
tell
the
truth
regarding
her
position
in
the
house
at
hammersmith
now
and
then
when
every
one
else
under
the
roof
was
asleep
she
took
from
a
locked
drawer
in
her
bedroom
a
little
and
busied
herself
with
figures
this
she
found
an
enjoyable
moment
it
was
very
pleasant
indeed
to
make
the
computation
of
what
the
rymers
owed
to
her
a
debt
of
which
the
payment
could
not
now
be
long
delayed
she
did
not
feel
quite
sure
with
regard
to
the
interest
but
the
principal
of
the
debt
was
very
easily
reckoned
and
it
would
make
a
nice
little
sum
to
put
by
certainly
miss
shepperson
was
not
unhappy
rymer
was
just
able
to
resume
her
normal
habits
to
write
many
letters
teach
her
children
pay
visits
in
distant
parts
of
london
the
care
of
the
baby
being
still
chiefly
left
to
miss
shepperson
when
on
a
pleasant
day
of
spring
a
little
before
rymer
rushed
into
the
house
calling
in
an
agitated
voice
his
wife
name
miss
shepperson
was
the
only
person
at
home
for
rymer
had
gone
out
with
the
children
the
servant
accompanying
her
to
wheel
baby
perambulator
she
ran
up
from
the
kitchen
aproned
with
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbow
and
met
the
excited
man
as
he
descended
from
a
vain
search
in
the
bedrooms
it
happened
she
cried
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
could
be
only
one
explanation
of
rymer
behaviour
he
died
this
morning
this
morning
they
clasped
hands
then
as
an
afterthought
their
eyes
fell
and
they
stood
limply
embarrassed
seems
shocking
to
take
the
news
in
this
way
murmured
rymer
the
relief
oh
the
relief
and
then
i
scarcely
knew
him
we
have
seen
each
other
for
years
i
ca
help
it
i
feel
as
if
i
had
thrown
off
a
load
of
tons
where
is
adelaide
which
way
have
they
gone
he
rushed
out
again
to
meet
his
wife
for
several
minutes
miss
shepperson
stood
motionless
in
a
happy
daze
until
she
suddenly
remembered
that
chops
were
at
the
kitchen
fire
and
sped
downstairs
throughout
that
day
and
indeed
for
several
days
to
come
rymer
behaved
very
properly
indeed
her
pleasant
refined
face
wore
a
becoming
gravity
and
when
she
spoke
of
the
deceased
she
called
him
she
did
not
attend
the
funeral
for
baby
happened
to
be
ailing
but
rymer
of
course
went
he
in
spite
of
conscientious
effort
to
imitate
his
wife
decorum
frequently
betrayed
the
joy
which
was
in
his
mind
miss
shepperson
heard
him
singing
as
he
got
up
in
the
morning
and
noticed
that
he
ate
with
unusual
appetite
the
house
brightened
before
the
end
of
a
week
smiles
and
cheerful
remarks
ruled
in
the
family
sorrows
were
forgotten
and
everybody
looked
forward
to
the
great
day
of
settlement
it
did
not
come
quickly
in
two
months
time
rymer
still
waited
upon
the
pleasure
of
the
executors
but
he
was
not
inactive
his
brother
at
birmingham
had
suggested
opening
in
that
city
thus
did
rymer
phrase
it
and
the
had
decided
to
leave
london
as
soon
as
his
affairs
were
in
order
towards
the
end
of
the
third
month
the
family
was
suffering
from
hope
deferred
rymer
had
once
more
a
troubled
face
and
his
wife
no
longer
talked
to
miss
shepperson
in
happy
strain
of
her
projects
for
the
future
at
length
notice
arrived
that
the
executors
were
prepared
to
settle
with
rymer
yet
in
announcing
the
fact
he
manifested
only
a
sober
contentment
while
rymer
was
heard
to
sigh
miss
shepperson
noted
these
things
and
wondered
a
little
but
smiling
assurance
that
now
at
last
all
was
well
revived
her
cheerful
expectations
with
a
certain
solemnity
she
was
summoned
a
day
or
two
later
to
a
morning
colloquy
in
the
rymer
sat
in
an
holding
a
bundle
of
papers
rymer
sat
on
the
sofa
the
dozing
baby
on
her
lap
over
against
them
their
friend
took
her
seat
with
a
little
cough
and
a
rustle
of
his
papers
the
polite
man
began
to
speak
shepperson
the
day
has
come
when
i
am
able
to
discharge
my
debt
to
you
you
will
not
misunderstand
that
expression
i
speak
of
my
debt
in
money
what
i
owe
to
you
what
we
all
owe
to
you
in
another
and
a
higher
sense
can
never
be
repaid
that
moral
debt
must
still
go
on
and
be
acknowledged
by
the
unfailing
gratitude
of
a
lifetime
a
lifetime
repeated
rymer
sweetly
murmuring
and
casting
towards
her
friend
an
eloquent
glance
however
resumed
her
husband
the
pecuniary
account
will
you
do
me
the
kindness
miss
shepperson
to
glance
it
over
and
see
if
you
find
it
correct
miss
shepperson
took
the
paper
which
was
covered
with
a
very
neat
array
of
figures
it
was
the
same
calculation
which
she
herself
had
so
often
made
but
with
interest
on
the
money
due
to
her
correctly
computed
the
weekly
sum
of
fifteen
shillings
for
board
and
lodging
had
been
deducted
throughout
the
whole
time
from
the
rent
due
to
her
as
landlady
rymer
stood
her
debtor
for
not
quite
thirty
pounds
correct
said
miss
shepperson
handing
back
the
paper
with
a
pleased
smile
rymer
turned
to
his
wife
what
do
say
dear
do
think
it
correct
rymer
shook
her
head
she
answered
gently
i
do
not
miss
shepperson
was
startled
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
saw
on
their
faces
only
the
kindliest
expression
really
thought
it
came
to
about
that
fell
from
her
lips
quite
reckon
the
interest
shepperson
said
rymer
impressively
you
really
think
that
we
should
allow
you
to
pay
us
for
your
board
and
lodging
you
our
valued
friend
you
who
have
toiled
for
us
who
have
saved
us
from
endless
trouble
and
embarrassment
that
indeed
would
be
a
little
too
shameless
this
account
is
a
mere
joke
as
i
hope
you
really
thought
it
i
insist
on
giving
you
a
cheque
for
the
total
amount
of
the
rent
due
to
you
from
the
day
when
you
first
entered
this
house
mr
rymer
panted
the
good
woman
turning
pale
with
astonishment
of
course
exclaimed
rymer
you
think
it
would
be
for
us
to
behave
in
any
other
way
surely
you
know
us
too
well
dear
miss
shepperson
kind
you
are
faltered
their
friend
unable
to
decide
in
herself
whether
she
should
accept
this
generosity
or
not
sorely
tempted
by
the
money
yet
longing
to
show
no
less
generous
a
spirit
on
her
own
side
really
do
know
rymer
imposed
silence
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
began
talking
in
a
slow
grave
way
shepperson
i
may
account
myself
a
happy
man
listen
to
a
very
singular
story
you
know
that
i
was
indebted
to
others
besides
you
i
have
communicated
with
all
those
persons
i
have
drawn
up
a
schedule
of
everything
i
owe
and
extraordinary
coincidence
the
of
my
debts
is
exactly
that
of
the
reversion
upon
which
i
have
entered
three
pounds
fourteen
shillings
murmured
rymer
as
if
delightedly
did
not
know
miss
shepperson
that
i
owed
so
much
i
had
forgotten
items
and
suppose
after
all
the
total
had
my
resources
that
indeed
would
have
been
a
blow
as
it
is
i
am
a
happy
man
my
wife
is
happy
we
pay
our
debts
to
the
last
farthing
and
we
begin
the
world
again
with
three
pounds
to
the
good
our
furniture
must
go
i
can
not
redeem
it
no
matter
i
owe
nothing
our
honour
is
saved
miss
shepperson
was
aghast
rymer
she
began
is
dreadful
what
are
you
going
to
do
is
arranged
dear
friend
rymer
replied
husband
has
a
little
post
in
birmingham
which
will
bring
him
in
just
enough
to
support
us
in
the
most
modest
lodgings
we
can
not
hope
to
have
a
house
of
our
own
for
we
are
determined
never
again
to
borrow
and
indeed
i
do
not
know
who
would
lend
to
us
we
are
poor
people
and
must
live
as
poor
people
do
miss
shepperson
i
ask
one
favour
of
you
will
you
permit
us
to
leave
your
house
without
the
customary
notice
we
should
feel
very
grateful
i
pay
susan
and
part
with
her
we
must
travel
to
birmingham
the
furniture
will
be
removed
by
the
people
who
take
possession
of
it
miss
shepperson
was
listening
with
a
bewildered
look
she
saw
rymer
stand
up
will
now
he
said
you
the
rent
from
the
day
mr
rymer
cried
the
agitated
woman
i
take
it
how
can
i
leave
you
penniless
i
should
feel
it
a
downright
robbery
that
i
should
shepperson
exclaimed
rymer
in
soft
reproach
you
understand
how
much
better
it
is
to
pay
all
we
owe
even
though
it
does
leave
us
penniless
why
even
darling
baby
she
kissed
it
say
so
if
she
could
speak
poor
little
mite
of
course
you
will
accept
the
money
i
insist
upon
it
you
wo
forget
us
we
will
send
you
our
address
and
you
shall
hear
of
your
little
godchild
her
voice
broke
she
sobbed
and
rebuked
herself
for
weakness
and
sobbed
again
meanwhile
rymer
stood
holding
out
banknotes
and
gold
the
distracted
miss
shepperson
made
a
wild
gesture
i
take
it
how
i
i
should
be
ashamed
the
longest
day
i
lived
must
insist
said
rymer
firmly
and
his
wife
calm
again
echoed
the
words
in
that
moment
miss
shepperson
clutched
at
the
notes
and
gold
and
with
a
quick
step
forward
took
hold
of
the
baby
hand
making
the
little
fingers
close
upon
the
money
i
give
it
to
little
dora
there
rymer
turned
away
to
hide
his
emotion
rymer
laid
baby
down
on
the
sofa
and
clasped
miss
shepperson
in
her
arms
a
few
days
later
the
house
at
hammersmith
was
vacant
the
rymers
wrote
from
birmingham
that
they
had
found
sufficient
though
humble
lodgings
and
were
looking
for
a
tiny
house
which
they
would
furnish
very
very
simply
with
the
money
given
to
baby
by
their
ever
dear
friend
it
may
be
added
that
they
had
told
the
truth
regarding
their
position
save
as
to
one
detail
rymer
thought
it
needless
to
acquaint
miss
shepperson
with
the
fact
that
his
brother
a
creditor
for
three
hundred
pounds
had
generously
forgiven
the
debt
miss
shepperson
lodging
in
a
little
bedroom
with
an
approving
conscience
to
keep
her
company
hoped
that
her
house
would
soon
be
let
again
a
daughter
of
the
lodge
for
a
score
of
years
the
rocketts
had
kept
the
lodge
of
brent
hall
in
the
beginning
rockett
was
head
gardener
his
wife
the
daughter
of
a
shopkeeper
had
never
known
domestic
service
and
performed
her
duties
at
the
hall
gates
with
a
certain
modest
dignity
not
displeasing
to
the
stately
persons
upon
whom
she
depended
during
the
lifetime
of
sir
henry
the
best
possible
understanding
existed
between
hall
and
lodge
though
health
broke
down
and
at
length
he
could
work
hardly
at
all
their
pleasant
home
was
assured
to
the
family
and
at
sir
henry
death
the
nephew
who
succeeded
him
left
the
rocketts
undisturbed
but
under
this
new
lordship
things
were
not
quite
as
they
had
been
sir
edwin
shale
a
man
had
in
his
youth
made
a
foolish
marriage
his
lady
ruled
him
not
with
the
gentlest
of
tongues
nor
always
to
the
kindest
purpose
and
their
daughter
hilda
asserted
her
rights
as
only
child
with
a
force
of
character
which
sir
edwin
would
perhaps
have
more
sincerely
admired
had
it
reminded
him
less
of
lady
shale
while
the
hall
in
sir
henry
time
remained
childless
the
lodge
prided
itself
on
a
boy
and
two
girls
young
rockett
something
of
a
scapegrace
was
by
the
baronet
advice
sent
to
sea
and
thenceforth
gave
his
parents
no
trouble
the
second
daughter
betsy
grew
up
to
be
her
mother
help
but
betsy
elder
sister
showed
from
early
years
that
the
life
of
the
lodge
would
afford
no
adequate
scope
for
ambitions
may
rockett
had
good
looks
what
was
more
she
had
an
intellect
which
sharpened
itself
on
everything
with
which
it
came
in
contact
the
village
school
could
never
have
been
held
responsible
for
may
rockett
acquirements
and
views
at
the
age
of
ten
nor
could
the
high
school
in
the
neighbouring
town
altogether
account
for
her
mental
development
at
seventeen
not
without
misgivings
had
the
gardener
and
his
wife
consented
to
may
pursuit
of
the
higher
learning
but
sir
henry
and
the
kind
old
lady
shale
seemed
to
think
it
the
safer
course
and
evidently
there
was
little
chance
of
the
accepting
any
humble
kind
of
employment
in
one
way
or
another
she
must
depend
for
a
livelihood
upon
her
brains
at
the
time
of
sir
succession
miss
rockett
had
already
obtained
a
place
as
governess
giving
her
parents
to
understand
that
this
was
only
of
course
a
temporary
expedient
a
paving
of
the
way
to
something
vaguely
but
superbly
independent
nor
was
promotion
long
in
coming
at
may
accepted
a
secretaryship
to
a
lady
with
a
mission
concerning
the
rights
of
womanhood
in
letters
to
her
father
and
mother
she
spoke
much
of
the
importance
of
her
work
but
did
not
confess
how
very
modest
was
her
salary
a
couple
of
years
went
by
without
her
visiting
the
old
home
then
of
a
sudden
she
made
known
her
intention
of
coming
to
stay
at
the
lodge
a
week
or
ten
days
she
explained
that
her
purpose
was
rest
intellectual
strain
had
begun
rather
to
tell
upon
her
and
a
few
days
of
absolute
tranquillity
such
as
she
might
expect
under
the
elms
of
brent
hall
would
do
her
all
the
good
in
the
world
course
she
added
unnecessary
to
say
anything
about
me
to
the
shale
people
they
and
i
have
nothing
in
common
and
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
ignore
each
other
existence
these
characteristic
phrases
troubled
and
rockett
that
the
family
at
the
hall
should
if
it
seemed
good
to
them
ignore
the
existence
of
may
was
in
the
rocketts
view
reasonable
enough
but
for
may
to
ignore
sir
edwin
and
lady
shale
who
were
just
now
in
residence
after
six
months
spent
abroad
struck
them
as
a
very
grave
impropriety
natural
respect
demanded
that
at
some
fitting
moment
and
in
a
suitable
manner
their
daughter
should
present
herself
to
her
feudal
superiors
to
whom
she
was
assuredly
indebted
though
indirectly
for
blessings
she
enjoyed
this
was
rockett
phrase
and
the
rheumatic
wheezy
old
gardener
uttered
the
same
opinion
in
less
conventional
language
they
had
no
affection
for
sir
edwin
or
his
lady
and
miss
hilda
they
decidedly
disliked
their
treatment
at
the
hands
of
these
new
people
contrasted
unpleasantly
enough
with
the
memory
of
old
times
but
a
spirit
of
loyal
subordination
ruled
their
blood
and
to
sir
edwin
at
all
events
they
felt
gratitude
for
their
retention
at
the
lodge
rockett
was
a
healthy
and
capable
woman
of
not
more
than
fifty
but
no
less
than
her
invalid
husband
would
she
have
dreaded
the
thought
of
turning
her
back
on
brent
hall
rockett
had
often
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
here
he
should
die
here
amid
the
fine
old
trees
that
he
loved
in
the
house
which
was
his
only
idea
of
home
and
was
it
not
a
reasonable
hope
that
betsy
good
steady
girl
should
some
day
marry
the
promising
young
gardener
whom
sir
edwin
had
recently
taken
into
his
service
and
so
the
old
order
of
things
at
the
lodge
half
wish
may
was
coming
said
rockett
after
long
and
anxious
thought
time
she
was
here
she
quite
upset
me
with
her
strange
talk
a
funny
girl
and
that
the
truth
muttered
rockett
from
his
old
leather
chair
full
in
the
sunshine
of
the
kitchen
window
they
had
a
nice
little
but
this
of
course
was
only
used
on
sunday
and
no
particular
idea
of
comfort
attached
to
it
may
to
be
sure
had
always
used
the
it
was
one
of
the
habits
which
emphasised
most
strongly
the
moral
distance
between
her
and
her
parents
the
subject
being
full
of
perplexity
they
put
it
aside
and
with
very
mixed
feelings
awaited
their
elder
daughter
arrival
two
days
later
a
cab
deposited
at
the
lodge
miss
may
and
her
and
her
and
her
holdall
together
with
certain
loose
periodicals
and
a
volume
or
two
bearing
the
yellow
label
of
mudie
the
young
lady
was
well
dressed
in
a
severely
practical
way
nothing
unduly
feminine
marked
her
appearance
and
in
the
matter
of
collar
and
necktie
she
inclined
to
the
example
of
the
other
sex
for
all
that
her
soft
complexion
and
bright
eyes
her
figure
and
light
quick
movements
had
a
picturesque
value
which
miss
may
certainly
did
not
ignore
she
manifested
no
excess
of
feeling
when
her
mother
and
sister
came
forth
to
welcome
her
a
nod
a
smile
an
offer
of
her
cheek
and
the
pleasant
exclamation
good
people
carried
her
through
this
little
scene
with
becoming
dignity
will
bring
these
things
inside
please
she
said
to
the
driver
in
her
agreeable
with
the
tone
and
gesture
of
one
who
habitually
gives
orders
her
father
bent
with
rheumatism
stood
awaiting
her
just
within
she
grasped
his
hand
cordially
and
cried
on
a
cheery
note
father
how
are
you
getting
on
no
worse
than
usual
i
hope
then
she
added
regarding
him
with
her
head
slightly
aside
must
have
a
talk
about
your
case
i
been
going
in
a
little
for
medicine
lately
no
doubt
your
country
medico
is
a
duffer
sit
down
sit
down
and
make
yourself
comfortable
i
do
want
to
disturb
any
one
about
teatime
is
it
mother
tea
very
weak
for
me
please
and
a
slice
of
lemon
with
it
if
you
have
such
a
thing
and
just
a
mouthful
of
dry
toast
so
unwilling
was
may
to
disturb
the
habits
of
the
family
that
half
an
hour
after
her
arrival
the
homely
three
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
and
could
neither
say
nor
do
anything
natural
to
them
of
a
sudden
there
sounded
a
sharp
rapping
at
the
window
rockett
and
betsy
started
up
and
betsy
ran
to
the
door
in
a
moment
or
two
she
came
back
with
glowing
cheeks
sure
i
never
heard
the
bell
she
exclaimed
with
compunction
shale
had
to
get
off
her
bicycle
it
she
who
hammered
at
the
window
asked
may
coldly
and
she
was
that
annoyed
will
do
her
good
a
little
anger
now
and
then
is
excellent
for
the
health
and
miss
rockett
sipped
her
tea
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
contempt
the
others
went
to
bed
at
ten
but
may
having
made
herself
at
ease
in
the
sat
there
reading
until
after
twelve
nevertheless
she
was
up
very
early
next
morning
and
before
going
out
for
a
sharp
little
walk
in
a
heavy
shower
she
gave
precise
directions
about
her
breakfast
she
wanted
only
the
simplest
things
prepared
in
the
simplest
way
but
the
tone
of
her
instructions
vexed
and
perturbed
rockett
sorely
after
breakfast
the
young
lady
made
a
searching
inquiry
into
the
state
of
her
father
health
and
diagnosed
his
ailments
in
such
learned
words
that
the
old
gardener
began
to
feel
worse
than
he
had
done
for
many
a
year
may
then
occupied
herself
with
correspondence
and
before
midday
sent
her
sister
out
to
post
nine
letters
i
thought
you
were
going
to
rest
yourself
said
her
mother
in
an
irritable
voice
quite
unusual
with
her
so
i
am
resting
may
exclaimed
you
saw
my
ordinary
work
i
suppose
you
have
a
london
newspaper
no
how
you
live
without
it
i
must
run
into
the
town
for
one
this
afternoon
the
town
was
three
miles
away
but
could
be
reached
by
train
from
the
village
station
on
reflection
miss
rockett
announced
that
she
would
use
this
opportunity
for
calling
on
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
she
desired
to
make
one
lindley
who
in
social
position
stood
on
an
equality
with
the
family
at
the
hall
and
was
often
seen
there
on
her
expressing
surprise
may
smiled
indulgently
should
i
know
lindley
i
have
heard
she
interested
in
a
movement
which
occupies
me
a
good
deal
just
now
i
know
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
me
i
can
give
her
a
good
deal
of
information
for
which
she
will
be
grateful
you
amuse
me
mother
she
added
in
her
blandest
tone
will
you
come
to
understand
what
my
position
is
the
rocketts
had
put
aside
all
thoughts
of
what
they
esteemed
may
duty
towards
the
hall
they
earnestly
hoped
that
her
stay
with
them
might
pass
unobserved
by
lady
and
miss
shale
whom
they
felt
sure
it
would
be
positively
dangerous
for
the
girl
to
meet
rockett
had
not
slept
for
anxiety
on
this
score
the
father
was
also
a
good
deal
troubled
but
his
wonder
at
may
bearing
and
talk
had
on
the
whole
an
agreeable
preponderance
over
the
uneasy
feeling
he
and
betsy
shared
a
secret
admiration
for
the
brilliant
qualities
which
were
flashed
before
their
eyes
they
privately
agreed
that
may
was
more
of
a
real
lady
than
either
the
baronet
wife
or
the
disdainful
hilda
shale
so
miss
rockett
took
the
early
afternoon
train
and
found
her
way
to
lindley
where
she
sent
in
her
card
at
once
admitted
to
the
she
gave
a
rapid
account
of
herself
naming
persons
whose
acquaintance
sufficiently
recommended
her
lindley
was
a
chatty
woman
who
had
a
lively
interest
in
everything
a
new
religion
or
a
new
stirred
her
to
just
the
same
kind
of
happy
excitement
she
had
no
prejudices
but
a
decided
preference
for
the
society
of
healthy
people
miss
rockett
talk
was
exactly
what
she
liked
for
it
glanced
at
innumerable
topics
of
the
sort
was
much
concerned
with
personalities
and
avoided
all
tiresome
precision
of
argument
you
making
a
stay
here
asked
the
hostess
i
am
with
my
people
in
the
country
not
far
off
may
answered
in
an
offhand
way
for
a
day
or
two
other
callers
were
admitted
but
miss
rockett
kept
the
lead
in
talk
she
glowed
with
feeling
that
she
was
really
showing
to
great
advantage
and
that
everybody
admired
her
when
the
door
again
opened
the
name
announced
was
shale
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
swift
sentence
may
looked
at
the
newcomer
and
saw
that
it
was
indeed
hilda
shale
of
brent
hall
but
this
did
not
disconcert
her
without
lowering
her
voice
she
finished
what
she
was
saying
and
ended
in
a
mirthful
key
the
baronet
daughter
had
come
into
town
on
her
bicycle
as
was
declared
by
the
short
skirt
easy
jacket
and
brown
shoes
which
well
displayed
her
athletic
person
she
was
a
tall
strongly
built
girl
of
with
a
face
of
hard
comeliness
and
magnificent
tawny
hair
all
her
movements
suggested
vigour
she
shook
hands
with
a
downward
jerk
moved
about
the
room
with
something
of
a
stride
and
in
sitting
down
crossed
her
legs
abruptly
from
the
first
her
look
had
turned
with
surprise
to
miss
rockett
when
after
a
minute
or
two
the
hostess
presented
that
young
lady
to
her
miss
shale
raised
her
eyebrows
a
little
smiled
in
another
direction
and
gave
a
just
perceptible
nod
may
behaviour
was
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
you
cycle
miss
rockett
asked
lindley
i
do
the
fact
is
i
have
never
found
time
to
learn
a
lady
remarked
that
nowadays
there
was
a
certain
distinction
in
not
cycling
whereupon
miss
shale
abrupt
and
rather
metallic
voice
sounded
what
was
meant
for
gentle
irony
a
pity
the
machines
ca
be
sold
cheaper
a
great
many
people
who
would
like
to
cycle
do
feel
able
to
afford
it
you
know
one
often
hears
of
such
cases
out
in
the
country
and
it
seems
awfully
hard
lines
it
miss
rockett
felt
a
warmth
ascending
to
her
ears
and
made
a
violent
effort
to
look
unconcerned
she
wished
to
say
something
but
could
not
find
the
right
words
and
did
not
feel
altogether
sure
of
her
voice
the
hostess
who
made
no
personal
application
of
miss
shale
remark
began
to
discuss
the
prices
of
bicycles
and
others
chimed
in
may
fretted
under
this
turn
of
the
conversation
seeing
that
it
was
not
likely
to
revert
to
subjects
in
which
she
could
shine
she
rose
and
offered
to
take
leave
you
really
go
fell
with
conventional
regret
from
the
lips
afraid
i
must
miss
rockett
replied
bracing
herself
under
the
converging
eyes
and
feeling
not
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
time
is
so
short
and
there
are
so
many
people
i
wish
to
see
as
she
left
the
house
anger
burned
in
her
it
was
certain
that
hilda
shale
would
make
known
her
circumstances
she
had
fancied
this
revelation
a
matter
of
indifference
but
after
all
the
thought
stung
her
intolerably
the
insolence
of
the
creature
with
her
hint
about
the
prohibitive
cost
of
bicycles
all
the
harder
to
bear
because
hitting
the
truth
may
would
have
long
ago
bought
a
bicycle
had
she
been
able
to
afford
it
straying
about
the
main
streets
of
the
town
she
looked
flushed
and
wrathful
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
her
humiliation
to
make
things
worse
she
lost
count
of
time
and
presently
found
that
she
had
missed
the
only
train
by
which
she
could
return
home
a
cab
would
be
too
much
of
an
expense
she
had
no
choice
but
to
walk
the
three
or
four
miles
the
evening
was
close
walking
rapidly
and
with
the
accompaniment
of
vexatious
thoughts
she
reached
the
gates
of
the
hall
tired
perspiring
irritated
just
as
her
hand
was
on
the
gate
a
trilled
vigorously
behind
her
and
from
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
a
voice
cried
imperatively
the
gate
please
miss
rockett
looked
round
and
saw
hilda
shale
slowly
wheeling
forward
in
expectation
that
way
would
be
made
for
her
deliberately
may
passed
through
the
side
entrance
and
let
the
little
gate
fall
to
miss
shale
dismounted
admitted
herself
and
spoke
to
may
now
at
the
lodge
door
with
angry
emphasis
you
hear
me
ask
you
to
open
could
imagine
you
were
speaking
to
answered
miss
rockett
with
brisk
dignity
supposed
some
servant
of
yours
was
in
sight
a
peculiar
smile
distorted
miss
shale
full
red
lips
without
another
word
she
mounted
her
machine
and
rode
away
up
the
elm
avenue
now
rockett
had
seen
this
encounter
and
heard
the
words
exchanged
she
was
lost
in
consternation
you
mean
by
behaving
like
that
may
why
i
was
running
out
myself
to
open
and
then
i
saw
you
were
there
and
of
course
i
thought
you
do
it
there
the
second
time
in
two
days
miss
shale
has
had
to
complain
about
us
how
you
forget
yourself
to
behave
and
speak
like
that
why
you
must
be
crazy
my
girl
do
seem
to
get
on
very
well
here
mother
was
may
reply
fact
is
i
in
a
false
position
i
shall
go
morning
and
there
be
any
more
trouble
thus
spoke
miss
rockett
as
one
who
shakes
off
a
petty
annoyance
she
knew
not
that
the
serious
trouble
was
just
beginning
a
few
minutes
later
rockett
went
up
to
the
hall
bent
on
humbly
apologising
for
her
impertinence
after
being
kept
waiting
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
was
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
housekeeper
who
had
a
rather
grave
announcement
to
make
rockett
i
sorry
to
tell
you
that
you
will
have
to
leave
the
lodge
my
lady
allows
you
two
months
though
as
your
wages
have
always
been
paid
monthly
only
a
month
notice
is
really
called
for
i
believe
some
allowance
will
be
made
you
but
you
will
hear
about
that
the
lodge
must
be
ready
for
its
new
occupants
on
the
last
day
of
october
the
poor
woman
all
but
sank
she
had
no
voice
for
protest
or
entreaty
a
sob
choked
her
and
blindly
she
made
her
way
to
the
door
of
the
room
then
to
the
exit
from
the
hall
in
the
world
is
the
matter
cried
may
hearing
from
the
whither
she
had
retired
a
clamour
of
distressful
tongues
she
came
into
the
kitchen
and
learnt
what
had
happened
now
i
hope
you
satisfied
exclaimed
her
mother
with
tearful
wrath
got
us
turned
out
of
our
home
you
lost
us
the
best
place
a
family
ever
had
and
i
hope
it
a
satisfaction
to
your
conceited
overbearing
mind
if
you
for
it
you
could
have
gone
to
work
better
and
much
care
we
below
you
we
are
we
like
dirt
under
your
feet
and
your
father
go
and
end
his
life
who
knows
where
miserable
as
miserable
can
be
and
your
sister
have
to
go
into
service
and
as
for
me
mother
shouted
the
girl
her
eyes
flashing
and
every
nerve
of
her
body
strung
the
shales
are
such
contemptible
wretches
as
to
turn
you
out
just
because
they
offended
with
i
should
have
thought
you
have
spirit
enough
to
tell
them
what
you
think
of
such
behaviour
and
be
glad
never
more
to
serve
such
brutes
father
what
do
say
tell
you
how
it
was
she
narrated
the
events
of
the
afternoon
amid
sobs
and
ejaculations
from
her
mother
and
betsy
rockett
who
was
just
now
in
anguish
of
lumbago
tried
to
straighten
himself
in
his
chair
before
replying
but
sank
helplessly
together
with
a
groan
ca
help
yourself
may
he
said
at
length
your
nature
my
girl
do
worry
i
see
sir
edwin
and
perhaps
he
listen
to
me
the
women
who
make
all
the
mischief
i
must
try
to
see
sir
edwin
a
pang
across
the
loins
made
him
end
abruptly
groaning
moaning
muttering
before
the
renewed
attack
of
her
mother
may
retreated
into
the
and
there
passed
an
hour
wretchedly
enough
a
knock
at
the
door
without
words
called
her
to
supper
but
she
had
no
appetite
and
would
not
join
the
family
circle
presently
the
door
opened
and
her
father
looked
in
worry
my
girl
he
whispered
see
sir
edwin
in
the
morning
may
uttered
no
reply
vaguely
repenting
what
she
had
done
she
at
the
same
time
rejoiced
in
the
recollection
of
her
passage
of
arms
with
miss
shale
and
was
inclined
to
despise
her
family
for
their
pusillanimous
attitude
it
seemed
to
her
very
improbable
that
the
expulsion
would
really
be
carried
out
lady
shale
and
hilda
meant
no
doubt
to
give
the
rocketts
a
good
fright
and
then
contemptuously
pardon
them
she
in
any
case
would
return
to
london
without
delay
and
make
no
more
trouble
a
pity
she
had
come
to
the
lodge
at
all
it
was
no
place
for
one
of
her
spirit
and
her
attainments
in
the
morning
she
packed
the
train
which
was
to
take
her
back
to
town
left
at
ten
and
after
breakfast
she
walked
into
the
village
to
order
a
cab
her
mother
would
scarcely
speak
to
her
betsy
was
continually
in
reproachful
tears
on
coming
back
to
the
lodge
she
saw
her
father
hobbling
down
the
avenue
and
walked
towards
him
to
ask
the
result
of
his
supplication
rockett
had
seen
sir
edwin
but
only
to
hear
his
sentence
of
exile
confirmed
the
baronet
said
he
was
sorry
but
could
not
interfere
the
matter
lay
in
lady
shale
hands
and
lady
shale
absolutely
refused
to
hear
any
excuses
or
apologies
for
the
insult
which
had
been
offered
her
daughter
all
up
with
us
said
the
old
gardener
who
was
pale
and
trembling
after
his
great
effort
must
go
but
do
worry
my
girl
worry
then
fright
took
hold
upon
may
rockett
she
felt
for
the
first
time
what
she
had
done
her
heart
fluttered
in
an
anguish
of
and
her
eyes
strayed
as
if
seeking
help
a
minute
hesitation
then
with
all
the
speed
she
could
make
she
set
off
up
the
avenue
towards
the
hall
presenting
herself
at
the
servants
entrance
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
housekeeper
of
course
her
story
was
known
to
all
the
domestics
half
a
dozen
of
whom
quickly
collected
to
stare
at
her
with
more
or
less
malicious
smiles
it
was
a
bitter
moment
for
miss
rockett
but
she
subdued
herself
and
at
length
obtained
the
interview
she
sought
with
a
cold
air
of
superiority
and
of
disapproval
the
housekeeper
listened
to
her
quick
broken
sentences
would
it
be
possible
may
asked
for
her
to
see
lady
shale
she
desired
to
to
apologise
for
for
rudeness
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
rudeness
in
which
her
family
had
no
part
which
they
utterly
deplored
but
for
which
they
were
to
suffer
severely
you
could
help
me
i
should
be
very
grateful
indeed
i
should
her
voice
all
but
broke
into
a
sob
that
cost
her
a
terrible
effort
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
smack
her
on
the
ears
you
will
go
the
servants
hall
and
wait
the
housekeeper
deigned
to
say
after
reflecting
see
what
can
be
done
and
miss
rockett
submitted
in
the
servants
hall
she
sat
for
a
long
long
time
observed
but
never
addressed
the
hour
of
her
train
went
by
more
than
once
she
was
on
the
point
of
rising
and
fleeing
more
than
once
her
smouldering
wrath
all
but
broke
into
flame
but
she
thought
of
her
pale
face
and
sat
on
at
something
past
eleven
a
footman
approached
her
and
said
curtly
are
to
go
up
to
my
lady
follow
me
may
followed
shaking
with
weakness
and
apprehension
burning
at
the
same
time
with
pride
all
but
in
revolt
conscious
of
nothing
on
the
way
she
found
herself
in
a
large
room
where
sat
the
two
ladies
who
for
some
moments
spoke
together
about
a
topic
of
the
day
placidly
then
the
elder
seemed
to
become
aware
of
the
girl
who
stood
before
her
are
rockett
elder
daughter
oh
the
metallic
voice
of
lady
shale
how
gratified
she
would
have
been
could
she
have
known
how
it
bruised
the
girl
pride
my
lady
why
do
you
want
to
see
me
wish
to
apologise
most
sincerely
to
your
ladyship
for
my
behaviour
of
last
evening
indeed
the
listener
interrupted
contemptuously
am
glad
you
have
come
to
your
senses
but
your
apology
must
be
offered
to
miss
shale
if
my
daughter
cares
to
listen
to
it
may
had
foreseen
this
it
was
the
bitterest
moment
of
her
ordeal
flushing
scarlet
she
turned
towards
the
younger
woman
shale
i
beg
your
pardon
for
what
i
said
yesterday
i
beg
you
to
forgive
my
rudeness
my
impertinence
her
voice
would
go
no
further
there
came
a
choking
sound
miss
shale
allowed
her
eyes
to
rest
triumphantly
for
an
instant
on
the
troubled
face
and
figure
then
remarked
to
her
mother
really
nothing
to
me
as
i
told
you
i
suppose
this
person
may
leave
the
room
now
it
was
fated
that
may
rockett
should
go
through
with
her
purpose
and
gain
her
end
but
fate
alone
which
meant
in
this
case
the
subtlest
preponderance
of
one
impulse
over
another
checked
her
on
the
point
of
a
burst
of
passion
which
would
have
startled
lady
shale
and
miss
hilda
out
of
their
complacency
in
the
silence
may
blood
gurgled
at
her
ears
and
she
tottered
with
dizziness
may
go
said
lady
shale
but
may
could
not
move
there
flashed
across
her
the
terrible
thought
that
perhaps
she
had
humiliated
herself
for
nothing
lady
i
hope
will
your
ladyship
please
to
forgive
my
father
and
mother
i
entreat
you
not
to
send
them
away
we
shall
all
be
so
grateful
to
your
ladyship
if
you
will
overlook
will
do
said
lady
shale
decisively
will
merely
say
that
the
sooner
you
leave
the
lodge
the
better
and
that
you
will
do
well
never
again
to
pass
the
gates
of
the
hall
you
may
go
miss
rockett
withdrew
outside
the
footman
was
awaiting
her
he
looked
at
her
with
a
grin
and
asked
in
an
undertone
good
but
may
to
whom
this
was
the
last
blow
rushed
past
him
lost
herself
in
corridors
ran
wildly
hither
and
thither
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
and
was
at
length
guided
by
a
maidservant
into
the
outer
air
fleeing
she
cared
not
whither
she
came
at
length
into
a
still
corner
of
the
park
and
there
hidden
amid
trees
watched
only
by
birds
and
rabbits
she
wept
out
the
bitterness
of
her
soul
by
an
evening
train
she
returned
to
london
not
having
confessed
to
her
family
what
she
had
done
and
suffering
still
from
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
result
a
day
or
two
later
betsy
wrote
to
her
the
happy
news
that
the
sentence
of
expulsion
was
withdrawn
and
peace
reigned
once
more
in
the
lodge
by
that
time
miss
rockett
had
all
but
recovered
her
and
was
so
busy
in
her
secretaryship
that
she
could
only
scribble
a
line
of
congratulation
she
felt
that
she
had
done
rather
a
meritorious
thing
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
did
not
care
to
boast
of
it
the
it
was
not
easy
for
daffy
to
leave
his
shop
for
the
whole
day
but
an
urgent
affair
called
him
to
london
and
he
breakfasted
early
in
order
to
catch
the
train
on
account
of
his
asthma
he
had
to
allow
himself
plenty
of
time
for
the
walk
to
the
station
and
all
would
have
been
well
but
that
just
as
he
was
polishing
his
silk
hat
and
giving
final
directions
to
his
assistant
in
stepped
a
customer
who
came
to
grumble
about
the
fit
of
a
new
coat
ten
good
minutes
were
thus
consumed
and
with
a
painful
glance
at
his
watch
the
breathless
tailor
at
length
started
the
walk
was
uphill
the
sun
was
already
powerful
daffy
reached
the
station
with
dripping
forehead
and
panting
as
if
his
sides
would
burst
there
stood
the
train
he
had
barely
time
to
take
his
ticket
and
to
rush
across
the
platform
as
a
porter
slammed
the
behind
him
he
sank
upon
the
seat
in
a
lamentable
condition
gasping
coughing
writhing
his
eyes
all
but
started
from
his
head
and
his
respectable
tumbled
to
the
floor
where
unconsciously
he
gave
it
a
kick
a
grotesque
and
distressing
sight
only
one
person
beheld
it
and
this
as
it
happened
a
friend
of
daffy
in
the
far
corner
sat
a
large
man
whose
eye
rested
upon
the
sufferer
with
a
look
of
greeting
disturbed
by
compassion
lott
a
of
this
town
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
more
flourishing
man
than
the
asthmatic
tailor
his
of
sound
flesh
and
muscle
his
ripe
sunburnt
complexion
his
attitude
of
eupeptic
and
ease
left
the
other
by
contrast
scarce
his
proverbial
fraction
of
manhood
at
a
year
or
two
short
of
fifty
daffy
began
to
be
old
he
was
and
had
a
pallid
wrinkled
visage
with
watery
pathetic
eye
at
fifty
turned
lott
showed
a
vigour
and
a
toughness
such
as
few
men
of
any
age
could
rival
for
a
score
of
years
the
measure
of
lott
robust
person
had
been
taken
by
professional
tape
and
without
intimacy
there
existed
kindly
relations
between
the
two
men
neither
had
ever
been
in
the
other
house
but
they
had
long
met
once
a
week
or
so
at
the
liberal
club
where
it
was
their
habit
to
play
together
a
game
of
draughts
occasionally
they
conversed
but
it
was
a
rather
dialogue
for
whereas
the
tailor
had
a
sprightly
intelligence
and
so
far
as
his
breath
allowed
a
ready
flow
of
words
the
found
himself
at
a
disadvantage
when
mental
activity
was
called
for
the
man
in
the
world
lott
would
sit
smiling
and
content
so
long
as
he
had
only
to
listen
asked
his
opinion
on
anything
but
timber
he
betrayed
by
a
knitting
of
the
brows
a
rolling
of
the
eyes
an
inflation
of
the
cheeks
and
other
signs
of
discomposure
the
serious
effort
it
cost
him
to
shape
a
thought
and
to
utter
it
at
times
daffy
got
on
to
the
subject
of
social
and
political
reform
and
after
copious
exposition
would
ask
what
lott
thought
he
knew
the
too
well
to
expect
an
immediate
reply
there
came
a
long
pause
during
which
lott
snorted
a
little
shuffled
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
vacancy
until
at
length
with
a
sudden
smile
of
relief
he
exclaimed
you
know
idea
and
the
idea
often
rather
explosively
stated
was
generally
marked
by
of
the
british
kind
this
morning
remarked
lott
abruptly
but
sympathetically
as
soon
as
the
writhing
tailor
could
hear
him
bad
ugh
ugh
had
to
run
ugh
does
suit
me
lott
gasped
the
other
as
he
took
the
silk
hat
which
his
friend
had
picked
up
and
stroked
for
him
weather
trying
vary
so
panted
daffy
wiping
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
one
things
seems
to
suit
me
ugh
ugh
sometimes
another
going
to
town
mr
lott
the
blunt
affirmative
was
accompanied
by
a
singular
grimace
such
as
might
have
been
caused
by
the
swallowing
of
something
very
unpleasant
and
thereupon
followed
a
silence
which
allowed
daffy
to
recover
himself
he
sat
with
his
eyes
half
closed
and
head
bent
leaning
back
they
had
a
general
acquaintance
with
each
other
domestic
affairs
both
were
widowers
both
lived
alone
daffy
son
was
married
and
dwelt
in
london
the
same
formula
applied
to
lott
daughter
and
as
it
happened
the
marriages
had
both
been
a
subject
of
parental
dissatisfaction
very
rarely
had
lott
let
fall
a
word
with
regard
to
his
daughter
bowles
but
the
townsfolk
were
well
aware
that
he
thought
his
a
fool
if
not
worse
bowles
in
the
seven
years
since
her
wedding
had
only
two
or
three
times
revisited
her
house
and
her
husband
never
came
a
like
reticence
was
maintained
by
daffy
concerning
his
son
charles
edward
once
the
hope
of
his
life
at
school
the
lad
had
promised
well
tailoring
could
not
be
thought
of
for
him
he
went
into
a
solicitor
office
and
remained
there
just
long
enough
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
no
turn
for
the
law
from
that
day
he
was
nothing
but
an
expense
and
an
anxiety
to
his
father
until
now
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
announced
his
establishment
in
a
prosperous
business
in
london
of
which
daffy
knew
nothing
more
than
that
it
was
connected
with
colonial
enterprise
since
that
date
charles
edward
had
made
no
report
of
himself
and
his
father
had
ceased
to
write
letters
which
received
no
reply
presently
lott
moved
so
as
to
come
nearer
to
his
travelling
companion
and
said
in
a
muttering
shamefaced
way
you
heard
any
talk
about
my
daughter
lately
daffy
showed
embarrassment
lott
i
sorry
to
say
i
heard
something
from
it
was
a
friend
of
mine
perhaps
i
wo
mention
the
name
who
came
and
told
me
something
something
that
quite
upset
me
that
what
i
going
to
town
about
lott
i
well
the
fact
is
i
was
going
to
call
upon
mr
bowles
you
were
exclaimed
the
with
gruffness
which
referred
not
to
his
friend
but
to
his
do
particularly
want
to
see
but
i
had
thought
of
seeing
my
daughter
you
mind
saying
whether
it
was
john
roper
it
was
we
both
heard
the
same
story
no
doubt
lott
leaned
back
and
stared
out
of
the
window
he
kept
thrusting
out
his
lips
and
drawing
them
in
again
at
the
same
time
wrinkling
his
forehead
into
the
frown
which
signified
that
he
was
trying
to
shape
a
thought
lott
resumed
the
tailor
with
a
gravely
troubled
look
i
ask
if
john
roper
made
any
mention
of
my
son
the
glared
and
daffy
interpreting
the
look
as
one
of
anger
trembled
under
it
feel
ashamed
and
miserable
burst
from
his
lips
not
your
fault
daffy
interrupted
the
other
in
a
growl
not
responsible
no
more
than
for
any
stranger
just
what
i
ca
feel
exclaimed
the
tailor
nervously
slapping
his
knee
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
a
man
to
have
a
son
a
bookmaker
a
blackguard
bookmaker
that
bad
enough
but
when
it
comes
to
robbing
and
ruining
the
friends
of
your
own
family
why
i
never
heard
a
more
disgraceful
thing
in
my
life
how
i
going
to
stand
in
my
shop
and
hold
up
my
head
before
my
customers
i
do
not
know
of
course
it
be
the
talk
of
the
town
we
know
what
the
ropers
are
when
they
get
hold
of
anything
it
drive
me
off
my
head
lott
i
sure
it
will
the
stretched
out
a
great
hand
and
laid
it
gently
on
the
excited
man
shoulder
worry
that
never
did
any
good
yet
we
got
to
find
out
first
of
all
how
much
of
roper
story
is
true
what
did
he
tell
you
said
that
bowles
had
been
going
down
the
hill
for
a
year
or
more
that
his
business
was
neglected
that
he
spent
his
time
at
racecourses
and
in
and
that
the
cause
of
it
all
was
my
son
son
what
had
my
son
to
do
with
it
why
did
i
know
that
charles
was
a
racing
and
betting
man
and
a
notorious
bookmaker
you
can
imagine
what
sort
of
a
feeling
that
gave
me
roper
could
believe
it
was
the
first
i
had
heard
of
it
he
said
lots
of
people
in
the
town
knew
how
charles
was
living
did
know
mr
lott
i
i
not
much
in
the
way
of
gossip
there
what
roper
said
it
was
last
night
and
what
with
that
and
my
cough
i
did
get
a
wink
of
sleep
after
it
about
three
this
morning
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
london
at
once
and
see
bowles
if
it
true
that
he
been
robbed
and
ruined
by
charles
i
only
one
thing
to
do
my
duty
plain
enough
i
shall
ask
him
how
much
money
charles
has
had
of
him
and
if
my
means
are
equal
to
it
i
shall
pay
every
penny
back
every
penny
lott
countenance
waxed
so
grim
that
one
would
have
thought
him
about
to
break
into
wrath
against
the
speaker
but
it
was
merely
his
way
of
disguising
a
pleasant
emotion
do
think
most
men
would
see
it
in
that
way
he
remarked
gruffly
they
would
or
not
exclaimed
daffy
panting
and
wriggling
as
plain
as
plain
could
be
that
there
no
other
course
for
a
man
who
respects
himself
i
could
live
a
day
with
such
a
burden
as
that
on
my
mind
a
bookmaker
a
blackguard
bookmaker
to
think
my
son
should
come
to
that
know
very
well
lott
that
there
nothing
i
hate
and
despise
more
than
we
often
talked
about
it
and
the
harm
it
does
and
the
sin
and
shame
it
is
that
such
doings
should
be
permitted
have
we
we
have
course
we
have
returned
the
other
with
a
nod
but
he
was
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
and
gave
only
half
an
ear
to
the
gasping
vehemences
which
daffy
poured
forth
for
the
next
ten
minutes
there
followed
a
short
silence
then
the
strong
man
shook
himself
and
opened
his
lips
you
know
idea
he
blurted
out
that
mr
lott
i
were
you
i
would
go
to
see
bowles
better
for
me
to
do
that
only
gossip
to
go
upon
and
we
know
what
that
often
amounts
to
leave
bowles
to
me
and
go
and
see
your
son
i
do
even
know
where
he
living
do
that
awkward
well
then
come
along
with
me
to
bowles
place
of
business
as
likely
as
not
if
we
find
him
he
be
able
to
give
you
your
son
address
what
do
you
say
to
my
idea
mr
daffy
the
tailor
assented
to
this
arrangement
on
condition
that
if
things
were
found
to
be
as
he
had
heard
he
should
be
left
free
to
obey
his
conscience
the
stopping
of
the
train
at
an
intermediate
station
where
new
passengers
entered
put
an
end
to
the
confidential
talk
daffy
breathing
hard
struggled
with
his
painful
thoughts
the
deeply
meditative
let
his
eyes
wander
about
the
carriage
as
they
drew
near
to
the
london
terminus
lott
bent
forward
to
his
friend
want
to
buy
a
present
for
my
eldest
nephew
he
remarked
i
for
the
life
of
me
think
what
it
had
better
be
you
see
something
in
a
suggested
daffy
i
shall
they
alighted
at
liverpool
street
lott
hailed
a
hansom
and
they
were
driven
to
a
street
in
southwark
where
at
the
entrance
of
a
building
divided
into
offices
one
perceived
the
name
of
bowles
and
perkins
this
firm
was
on
the
fifth
floor
and
daffy
eyed
the
staircase
with
misgiving
need
for
you
to
go
up
said
his
companion
here
and
i
see
if
i
can
get
the
address
lott
was
absent
for
only
a
few
minutes
he
came
down
again
with
his
lips
hard
set
knocking
each
step
sharply
with
his
got
it
he
said
and
named
a
southern
suburb
you
seen
mr
bowles
he
out
of
town
was
the
reply
his
partner
they
walked
side
by
side
for
a
short
way
then
lott
stopped
you
know
idea
it
a
little
after
eleven
i
going
to
see
my
daughter
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
catch
the
home
from
liverpool
street
suppose
we
take
our
chance
of
meeting
there
thus
it
was
agreed
daffy
turned
in
the
direction
of
his
son
abode
the
went
northward
and
presently
reached
finsbury
park
where
in
a
house
of
unpretentious
but
decent
appearance
dwelt
bowles
the
servant
who
answered
the
door
wore
a
strange
look
as
if
something
had
alarmed
her
she
professed
not
to
know
whether
any
one
was
at
home
and
on
going
to
inquire
shut
the
door
on
the
visitor
face
a
few
minutes
elapsed
before
lott
was
admitted
the
hall
struck
him
as
rather
bare
and
at
the
entrance
of
the
he
stopped
in
astonishment
for
excepting
the
and
a
few
ornaments
the
room
was
quite
unfurnished
at
the
far
end
stood
a
young
woman
her
hands
behind
her
and
her
head
bent
an
attitude
indicative
of
distress
or
shame
you
moving
jane
inquired
lott
eyeing
her
curiously
his
daughter
looked
at
him
she
had
a
comely
face
with
no
little
of
the
paternal
character
stamped
upon
it
her
knitted
brows
and
sullen
eyes
bespoke
a
perturbed
humour
and
her
voice
was
only
just
audible
we
are
moving
father
lott
heavy
footfall
crossed
the
floor
he
planted
himself
before
her
his
hands
resting
on
his
stick
the
matter
jane
where
bowles
left
town
yesterday
he
be
back
i
think
had
the
brokers
in
the
house
is
that
it
eh
bowles
made
no
answer
but
her
head
sank
again
and
a
trembling
of
her
shoulders
betrayed
the
emotion
with
which
she
strove
knowing
that
jane
would
tell
of
her
misfortunes
only
when
and
how
she
chose
the
father
turned
away
and
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
at
the
window
then
he
asked
abruptly
whether
there
was
not
such
a
thing
as
a
chair
in
the
house
bowles
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
speaking
bade
him
come
to
another
room
it
was
the
but
all
the
appropriate
furniture
had
vanished
a
couple
of
bedroom
chairs
and
a
deal
table
served
for
present
necessities
here
when
they
had
both
sat
down
bowles
found
courage
to
break
the
silence
does
know
of
it
he
went
away
yesterday
morning
and
the
men
came
in
the
afternoon
he
had
a
promise
a
distinct
promise
that
this
should
be
done
before
the
end
of
the
month
by
then
he
hoped
to
have
money
the
creditor
inquired
lott
with
a
searching
look
at
her
face
bowles
was
mute
her
eyes
cast
down
it
charles
daffy
still
his
daughter
kept
silence
thought
so
said
the
and
clumped
on
the
floor
with
his
stick
better
tell
me
all
about
it
jane
i
know
something
already
better
let
us
talk
it
over
my
girl
and
see
what
can
be
done
he
waited
a
moment
then
his
daughter
tried
to
speak
with
difficulty
overcame
a
sob
and
at
length
began
her
story
she
would
not
blame
her
husband
he
had
been
unlucky
in
speculations
and
was
driven
to
a
his
acquaintance
charles
daffy
this
man
a
heartless
rascal
had
multiplied
charges
and
interest
on
a
small
sum
originally
borrowed
until
it
became
a
crushing
debt
he
held
a
bill
of
sale
on
most
of
their
furniture
and
yesterday
as
if
he
knew
of
bowles
absence
had
made
the
seizure
he
was
within
his
legal
rights
but
had
led
the
debtor
to
suppose
that
he
would
not
exercise
them
thus
far
did
jane
relate
in
a
hard
voice
but
with
many
nervous
movements
her
father
listened
in
grim
silence
and
when
she
ceased
appeared
to
reflect
story
he
said
of
a
sudden
what
about
the
know
nothing
of
was
the
cold
reply
keeps
all
that
to
himself
does
he
we
better
have
our
talk
out
jane
now
that
we
begun
better
tell
me
all
you
know
my
girl
again
there
was
a
long
pause
but
lott
had
patience
and
his
dogged
persistency
at
length
overcame
the
wife
pride
yes
it
was
true
that
bowles
had
lost
money
at
races
he
had
been
guilty
of
much
selfish
folly
but
the
ruin
it
had
brought
upon
him
would
serve
as
a
lesson
he
was
a
wretched
and
a
penitent
man
a
few
days
ago
he
had
confessed
everything
to
his
wife
and
besought
her
to
pardon
him
at
present
he
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
recover
an
honest
footing
the
business
might
still
be
carried
on
if
some
one
could
be
induced
to
put
a
little
capital
into
it
with
that
in
view
bowles
had
gone
to
see
certain
relatives
of
his
in
the
north
if
his
hope
failed
she
did
not
know
what
was
before
them
they
had
nothing
left
now
but
their
clothing
and
the
furniture
of
one
or
two
rooms
you
like
to
come
back
home
for
a
while
asked
lott
abruptly
father
was
the
not
less
abrupt
reply
could
do
that
give
no
money
to
bowles
has
never
asked
you
and
never
will
lott
glared
and
glowered
but
with
all
that
had
something
in
his
face
which
hinted
softness
the
dialogue
did
not
continue
much
longer
it
ended
with
a
promise
from
bowles
to
let
her
father
know
whether
her
husband
succeeded
or
not
in
himself
thereupon
they
shook
hands
without
a
word
and
lott
left
the
house
he
returned
to
the
city
and
it
being
now
nearly
two
made
a
hearty
meal
when
he
was
in
the
street
again
he
remembered
the
birthday
present
he
wished
to
buy
for
his
nephew
and
for
half
an
hour
he
rambled
vaguely
staring
into
at
length
something
caught
his
eye
it
was
a
row
of
mounted
in
silver
just
the
thing
he
said
to
himself
to
please
a
lad
who
would
perhaps
ride
to
hounds
next
winter
he
stepped
in
chose
carefully
and
made
the
purchase
then
having
nothing
left
to
do
he
walked
at
a
leisurely
pace
towards
the
railway
station
daffy
was
there
before
him
they
met
at
the
entrance
to
the
platform
from
which
their
train
would
start
you
go
back
by
this
asked
the
tailor
son
was
at
home
and
wo
be
till
about
five
i
should
be
terribly
obliged
lott
if
you
could
stay
and
go
to
clapham
with
me
is
it
asking
too
much
the
gave
a
friendly
nod
and
said
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
then
in
reply
to
anxious
questions
he
made
brief
report
of
what
he
had
learnt
at
finsbury
park
daffy
was
beside
himself
with
wrath
and
shame
he
would
pay
every
farthing
if
he
had
to
sell
all
he
possessed
so
glad
and
so
thankful
you
will
come
with
me
lott
he
care
nothing
for
what
said
but
when
he
sees
and
hears
your
opinion
of
him
it
may
have
some
effect
i
beg
you
to
tell
him
your
mind
plainly
let
him
know
what
a
contemptible
wretch
what
a
dirty
blackguard
he
is
in
the
eyes
of
all
decent
folk
let
him
know
it
i
entreat
you
perhaps
even
yet
it
is
too
late
to
make
him
ashamed
of
himself
they
stood
amid
a
rush
of
people
the
panting
tailor
clung
to
his
big
companion
sleeve
gruffly
promising
to
do
what
he
could
lott
led
the
way
into
the
street
again
where
they
planned
the
rest
of
their
day
by
five
they
were
at
clapham
charles
daffy
occupied
the
kind
of
house
which
is
known
as
eminently
respectable
it
suggested
an
income
of
at
least
a
couple
of
thousand
a
year
as
they
waited
for
the
door
to
open
lott
smote
gently
on
his
leg
with
the
new
he
had
been
silent
and
meditative
all
the
way
hither
a
smart
maidservant
conducted
them
to
the
and
there
in
a
minute
or
two
they
were
joined
by
charles
no
one
could
have
surmised
from
this
gentleman
appearance
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
little
tradesman
who
stood
before
him
nature
had
given
the
younger
daffy
a
tall
and
shapely
person
and
experience
of
life
had
refined
his
manners
to
an
easy
assurance
he
would
never
have
learnt
from
paternal
example
his
visage
so
long
as
it
remained
grave
might
have
been
that
of
an
acute
and
energetic
lawyer
his
smile
however
disturbed
this
impression
for
it
had
a
twinkling
insolence
a
raffish
facetiousness
incompatible
with
any
sober
quality
he
wore
the
morning
dress
of
a
city
man
with
collar
and
necktie
of
the
latest
fashion
his
watchguard
was
rather
demonstrative
and
he
had
two
very
solid
rings
on
his
left
hand
dad
how
do
you
do
he
exclaimed
on
entering
in
an
affected
what
the
matter
daffy
had
drawn
back
refusing
the
offered
hand
with
an
unpleasant
smile
charles
turned
to
his
other
visitor
lott
is
it
you
looking
well
lott
but
i
suppose
you
did
come
here
just
to
give
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
i
rather
a
busy
man
perhaps
one
or
the
other
of
you
will
be
good
enough
to
break
this
solemn
silence
and
let
me
know
what
your
game
is
he
spoke
with
careless
impertinence
and
let
himself
drop
on
to
a
chair
the
others
remained
standing
and
daffy
broke
into
vehement
speech
have
come
here
charles
to
ask
what
you
mean
by
disgracing
yourself
and
dishonouring
my
name
only
yesterday
for
the
first
time
i
heard
of
the
life
you
are
leading
is
this
how
you
repay
me
for
all
the
trouble
i
took
to
have
you
well
educated
and
to
make
you
an
honest
man
here
i
find
you
living
in
luxury
and
extravagance
and
how
on
stolen
money
money
as
much
stolen
as
if
you
were
a
pickpocket
or
a
burglar
a
pleasant
thing
for
me
to
have
all
my
friends
talking
about
charles
daffy
the
bookmaker
and
the
moneylender
what
have
you
to
dishonour
your
father
in
this
way
i
ask
what
have
you
charles
here
the
speaker
who
had
struggled
to
gasp
his
last
sentence
was
overcome
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
he
tottered
back
and
sank
on
to
a
sofa
you
here
to
look
after
him
asked
charles
of
lott
crossing
his
legs
and
nodding
towards
the
sufferer
so
i
advise
you
to
take
him
away
before
he
does
himself
harm
you
a
bigger
than
he
is
and
perhaps
have
more
sense
the
stood
with
legs
slightly
apart
holding
his
stick
and
the
horizontally
with
both
hands
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
young
daffy
and
his
lips
moved
in
rather
an
ominous
way
but
he
made
no
reply
to
charles
smiling
remark
lott
said
the
tailor
in
a
voice
still
broken
by
pants
and
coughs
you
speak
or
me
will
you
say
what
you
think
of
him
have
to
be
quick
about
it
interposed
charles
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
can
give
you
five
minutes
you
can
say
a
in
that
time
if
you
sound
of
wind
the
eyes
were
very
wide
and
his
cheeks
unusually
red
abruptly
he
turned
to
daffy
you
know
idea
but
just
as
he
spoke
there
sounded
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
smart
maidservant
cried
out
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
her
master
is
it
asked
charles
the
answer
came
from
the
visitor
himself
who
pushing
the
servant
aside
broke
into
the
room
it
was
a
young
man
of
no
very
distinguished
appearance
thin
with
a
pasty
complexion
and
a
scrubby
moustache
his
clothes
were
approaching
shabbiness
and
he
had
an
unwashed
look
due
in
part
to
hasty
travel
on
this
hot
day
streaming
with
sweat
his
features
distorted
with
angry
excitement
he
shouted
as
he
entered
got
to
see
me
daffy
i
wo
be
refused
in
the
same
moment
his
glance
discovered
the
two
visitors
and
he
stopped
short

i
glad
of
it
i
awfully
glad
of
it

house
this
morning

liar
and
swindler

the
opportunity
to
sell
up
my
furniture
he
tell
you
he
had
a
legal
right
but
he
gave
me
his
word
not
to
do
anything
till
the
end
of
the
month
and
in
any
case
i
do
really
owe
him
half
the
sum
he
has
down
against
me
i
paid
that
scoundrel
hundreds
of
pounds
honourably
paid
him
debts
of
honour
and
now
he
has
the
face
to
charge
me
sixty
per
cent
on
money
i
was
fool
enough
to
borrow
from
him
sixty
per
what

think
of
that
lott
what
do
think
of
it
sir
sorry
to
say
it
does
at
all
surprise
me
answered
daffy
who
perceived
that
the
speaker
was
lott
i
sympathise
with
you
very
much
if
you
have
dealings
with
a
blackleg
a
blackleg
shouted
bowles
are
respectable
men
in
comparison
with
him
he
bled
me
the
brute
he
tempted
me
on
and
on
look
here
lott
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
i
been
an
infernal
fool
i
had
my
eyes
opened
now
that
it
too
late
i
hear
my
wife
told
you
that
and
i
glad
she
did
i
been
a
fool
yes
but
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
greatest
scoundrel
unhung
and
he
ruined
me
you
heard
from
jane
what
i
was
gone
about
it
no
good
i
came
back
by
the
first
train
this
morning
without
a
mouthful
of
breakfast
it
all
up
with
me
i
a
cursed
beggar
and
that
thief
is
the
cause
of
it
and
he
comes
into
my
house
no
better
than
a
burglar
and
lays
his
hands
on
everything
bring
money
where
the
account
of
that
sale
you
liar
i
go
to
a
magistrate
about
this
charles
daffy
sat
in
a
reposeful
attitude
the
scene
amused
him
he
chuckled
inwardly
from
time
to
time
but
of
a
sudden
his
aspect
changed
he
started
up
and
spoke
with
a
snarling
emphasis
had
just
about
enough
look
here
clear
out
all
of
you
there
the
door
go
daffy
moved
towards
him
that
how
you
speak
to
your
father
charles
he
exclaimed
indignantly
it
is
take
your
hook
with
the
others
i
sick
of
your
listen
to
me
before
i
go
cried
daffy
his
short
and
awkward
figure
straining
in
every
muscle
for
the
dignity
of
righteous
wrath
do
know
whether
you
are
more
a
fool
or
a
knave
perhaps
you
really
think
that
there
as
much
to
be
said
for
your
way
of
earning
a
living
as
for
any
other
i
hope
you
do
for
it
a
cruel
thing
to
suppose
that
my
son
has
turned
out
a
shameless
scoundrel
let
me
tell
you
then
this
business
of
yours
is
one
that
moves
every
honest
and
sensible
man
to
anger
and
disgust
it
matters
nothing
whether
you
keep
the
rules
of
the
blackguard
game
or
whether
you
cheat
the
difference
between
bookmaker
and
blackleg
is
so
small
that
it
is
worth
talking
about
you
live
by
the
plunder
of
people
who
are
foolish
and
vicious
enough
to
fall
into
your
clutches
you
an
enemy
of
society
that
the
plain
truth
of
it
as
much
an
enemy
of
society
as
the
forger
or
the
burglar
you
live
and
live
in
luxury
by
the
worst
vice
of
our
time
the
vice
which
is
rotting
english
life
the
vice
which
will
be
our
national
ruin
if
it
goes
on
much
longer
when
you
were
a
boy
you
heard
me
many
a
time
say
all
i
thought
about
racing
and
betting
you
heard
me
speak
with
scorn
of
the
people
who
set
so
vile
an
example
to
the
classes
below
them
if
i
could
have
foreseen
that
would
sink
to
such
disgrace
charles
was
standing
in
an
attitude
of
contemptuous
patience
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
interjected
a
remark
can
only
allow
your
eloquence
one
minute
and
a
half
more
will
be
enough
replied
his
father
sternly
only
thing
i
have
to
add
is
that
all
the
money
you
have
stolen
from
bowles
i
as
a
simple
duty
shall
repay
you
no
longer
a
boy
in
the
eye
of
the
law
i
am
not
responsible
for
you
but
for
very
shame
i
must
make
good
the
wrong
you
have
done
in
this
case
i
could
stand
in
my
shop
day
by
day
and
know
that
every
one
was
saying
there
the
man
whose
son
ruined
lott
and
sold
up
his
home
unless
i
had
done
all
i
could
to
repair
the
mischief
i
shall
ask
bowles
for
a
full
account
of
what
he
has
lost
to
you
and
if
it
in
my
power
every
penny
shall
be
made
good
he
thank
goodness
seems
to
have
learnt
his
lesson
i
have
daffy
that
i
have
cried
bowles
not
much
fear
that
fall
into
your
clutches
again
and
i
hope
i
most
earnestly
hope
that
before
you
can
do
much
more
harm
overreach
yourself
and
the
law
stupid
as
it
is
will
get
hold
of
you
remember
the
father
i
was
charles
and
think
what
it
means
that
the
best
wish
i
can
now
form
for
you
is
that
you
may
come
to
public
disgrace
no
one
applaud
asked
charles
looking
round
the
room
rather
unkind
seeing
how
the
speaker
has
blown
himself
be
off
dad
and
do
fool
any
longer
bowles
take
your
hook
lott
charles
met
the
eye
of
the
and
was
unexpectedly
mute
sir
said
lott
regarding
him
fixedly
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
my
time
is
too
valuable
to
be
wasted
continued
the
other
with
an
impatient
gesture
good
enough
to
leave
my
house
lott
said
the
tailor
in
an
exhausted
voice
apologise
to
you
for
my
son
rudeness
i
gave
you
the
trouble
of
coming
here
hoping
it
might
shame
him
but
i
afraid
it
been
no
good
let
us
go
lott
regarded
him
mildly
daffy
he
said
do
mind
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
in
private
with
your
son
do
you
and
bowles
go
on
to
the
station
and
wait
for
me
perhaps
i
shall
catch
you
up
before
you
get
there
have
told
you
already
lott
shouted
charles
i
can
waste
no
more
time
on
you
i
refuse
to
talk
with
you
at
all
i
charles
daffy
was
the
resolute
answer
to
leave
this
room
till
i
have
had
a
word
with
you
do
you
want
to
say
asked
charles
brutally
to
let
you
know
an
idea
of
mine
was
the
reply
idea
that
come
to
me
whilst
i
stood
here
listening
the
tailor
and
bowles
moved
towards
the
door
charles
glanced
at
them
fiercely
and
insolently
then
turned
his
look
again
upon
the
man
who
remained
the
other
two
passed
out
the
door
closed
lott
stick
and
still
held
horizontally
seemed
to
be
lost
in
meditation
blurted
charles
is
it
lott
regarded
him
steadily
and
spoke
with
his
wonted
deliberation
heard
what
your
father
said
about
paying
that
money
back
course
i
heard
if
he
idiot
enough
you
know
idea
young
man
you
better
do
the
honest
thing
and
repay
it
yourself
charles
stared
for
a
moment
then
sputtered
a
laugh
idea
is
it
lott
well
it
is
mine
so
good
morning
again
the
seemed
to
meditate
his
eyes
wandered
from
charles
to
the
table
a
minute
more
he
resumed
have
another
idea
not
a
new
one
an
idea
that
came
to
me
long
ago
when
your
father
first
began
to
have
trouble
about
you
i
happened
to
be
in
the
shop
one
day
it
was
when
you
were
living
idle
at
your
father
expense
young
man
and
i
heard
you
speak
to
him
in
what
i
call
a
confoundedly
impertinent
way
thinking
it
over
afterwards
i
said
to
myself
if
i
had
a
son
who
spoke
to
me
like
that
give
him
the
soundest
thrashing
he
be
ever
likely
to
get
that
was
my
idea
young
man
and
as
i
stood
listening
to
you
it
came
back
into
my
mind
again
your
father
ca
thrash
you
he
has
the
brawn
for
it
but
as
it
nothing
less
than
a
public
duty
somebody
and
so
charles
who
had
been
watching
every
movement
of
the
speaker
face
suddenly
sprang
forward
making
for
the
door
but
lott
had
foreseen
this
with
astonishing
alertness
and
vigour
he
intercepted
the
fugitive
seized
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
after
a
moment
struggle
pinned
him
face
downwards
across
the
end
of
the
table
his
stick
he
had
thrown
aside
the
he
held
between
his
teeth
so
brief
was
this
conflict
that
there
sounded
only
a
scuffling
of
feet
on
the
floor
and
a
growl
of
fury
from
charles
as
he
found
himself
handled
like
an
infant
then
during
some
two
minutes
one
might
have
thought
that
a
couple
of
very
strenuous
were
at
work
in
the
room
for
the
space
of
a
dozen
switches
charles
strove
frantically
with
wild
kicks
which
wounded
only
the
air
but
all
in
silence
gripped
only
the
more
tightly
he
at
length
uttered
a
yell
of
pain
followed
by
curses
hot
and
swift
still
the
seemed
to
be
at
work
and
more
vigorously
than
ever
charles
began
to
roar
as
it
happened
there
were
only
servants
in
the
house
when
the
clamour
had
lasted
long
enough
to
be
really
alarming
knocks
sounded
at
the
door
which
at
length
was
thrown
open
and
the
startled
face
of
a
domestic
appeared
at
the
same
moment
lott
his
right
arm
being
weary
brought
the
castigatory
exercise
to
an
end
charles
rolled
to
his
feet
and
began
to
strike
out
furiously
with
both
fists
as
you
like
young
man
said
the
as
he
coolly
warded
off
the
blows
you
wish
to
have
it
this
way
too
but
i
warn
you
it
is
a
fair
match
sally
shut
the
door
and
go
about
your
business
i
fetch
a
sir
shrilled
the
servant
her
master
sufficiently
restored
to
his
senses
to
perceive
that
he
had
not
the
least
chance
in
a
pugilistic
encounter
with
lott
drew
back
and
seemed
to
hesitate
the
girl
said
lott
as
he
picked
up
his
whip
and
examined
its
condition
we
have
a
policeman
in
the
door
charles
shouted
fiercely
the
men
gazed
at
each
other
daffy
was
pale
and
quivering
his
hair
in
disorder
his
waistcoat
torn
open
collar
and
necktie
twisted
into
rags
he
made
a
pitiful
figure
the
was
slightly
heated
but
his
countenance
wore
an
expression
of
calm
contentment
the
present
remarked
lott
as
he
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
think
our
business
is
at
an
end
it
is
often
that
a
fellow
of
your
sort
gets
his
deserts
and
i
rather
sorry
we
did
have
the
policeman
in
a
report
of
the
case
might
do
good
i
bid
you
good
day
young
man
if
i
were
you
i
sit
quiet
for
an
hour
or
two
and
just
reflect
you
a
to
think
about
so
with
a
pleasant
smile
the
visitor
took
his
leave
as
he
walked
away
he
again
examined
the
is
often
a
thing
happens
so
luckily
he
said
to
himself
whip
hardly
a
bit
damaged
harry
like
it
none
the
worse
for
my
having
handselled
it
at
the
station
he
found
daffy
and
bowles
who
regarded
him
with
questioning
looks
to
be
got
out
of
him
said
lott
i
want
a
talk
with
you
and
jane
it
be
best
perhaps
if
i
go
back
home
with
you
daffy
sorry
we
ca
travel
down
together
you
catch
the
eight
hope
you
told
him
plainly
what
you
thought
of
him
said
daffy
in
a
voice
of
indignant
shame
did
answered
the
i
do
think
he
very
likely
to
forget
it
fate
and
the
apothecary
chemist
by
examination
so
did
the
good
man
proclaim
himself
to
a
suburb
of
a
city
in
the
west
of
england
it
was
one
of
those
pretty
clean
suburbs
only
to
be
found
in
the
west
a
few
dainty
little
shops
everything
about
them
bright
or
glistening
scattered
among
pleasant
little
houses
with
gardens
eternally
green
and
all
but
perennially
in
bloom
every
vista
ending
in
foliage
and
in
one
direction
a
far
glimpse
of
the
cathedral
towers
sending
forth
their
music
to
fall
dreamily
upon
these
quiet
roads
the
neighbourhood
seemed
to
breathe
a
tranquil
prosperity
emissaries
of
butcher
baker
and
grocer
in
hand
knocked
cheerily
at
kitchen
doors
and
went
smiling
away
the
ponies
they
drove
were
well
fed
and
frisky
their
carts
spick
and
span
the
church
of
the
parish
an
imposing
edifice
dated
only
from
a
few
years
ago
and
had
cost
its
noble
founder
a
sum
of
money
which
any
parishioner
would
have
named
to
you
with
proper
awe
the
population
was
largely
female
and
every
shopkeeper
who
knew
his
business
had
become
proficient
in
bowing
smiling
and
suave
servility
farmiloe
it
is
to
be
feared
had
no
very
profound
acquaintance
with
his
business
from
any
point
of
view
true
he
was
by
examination
but
it
had
cost
him
repeated
efforts
to
reach
this
unassailable
ground
and
more
than
one
pharmaceutist
with
whom
he
abode
as
assistant
had
felt
it
a
measure
of
prudence
to
dispense
with
his
services
give
him
time
and
he
was
generally
equal
to
the
demands
of
suburban
customers
hurry
or
interrupt
him
and
he
showed
himself
anything
but
the
man
for
a
crisis
face
and
demeanour
were
against
him
he
had
exceedingly
plain
features
and
a
persistently
sour
expression
even
his
smile
suggested
sarcasm
he
could
not
tune
his
voice
to
the
tradesman
note
and
on
the
slightest
provocation
he
became
quite
unintentionally
offensive
such
a
man
had
no
chance
whatever
in
this
flowery
and
bowery
little
suburb
yet
he
came
hither
with
hopes
one
circumstance
seemed
to
him
especially
favourable
the
shop
was
also
a
and
no
one
could
fail
to
see
it
was
put
most
impressively
by
the
predecessor
who
sold
him
the
business
how
advantageous
was
this
blending
of
public
service
with
commercial
interest
especially
as
there
was
no
telegraphic
work
to
make
a
skilled
assistant
necessary
as
a
matter
of
course
people
using
the
would
patronise
the
chemist
and
a
provincial
chemist
can
add
to
his
legitimate
business
sundry
pleasant
little
tradings
which
benefit
himself
without
provoking
the
jealousy
of
neighbour
shopmen
will
be
your
own
fault
my
dear
sir
if
you
do
not
make
a
very
good
thing
of
it
indeed
the
sole
and
sufficient
explanation
of
of
the
decline
during
this
last
year
or
two
is
my
shocking
health
i
really
have
been
able
to
do
justice
to
the
business
necessarily
farmiloe
entered
into
negotiation
with
the
postal
authorities
and
it
was
with
some
little
disappointment
that
he
learnt
how
very
modest
could
be
his
direct
remuneration
for
the
responsibilities
and
labours
he
undertook
the
is
a
very
shrewdly
managed
department
of
the
public
service
it
has
brought
to
perfection
the
art
of
obtaining
results
with
a
expenditure
but
farmiloe
remembered
the
other
aspect
of
the
matter
he
would
benefit
so
largely
by
this
undertaking
that
grumbling
was
foolish
moreover
the
thing
carried
dignity
with
it
he
served
his
majesty
he
served
the
nation
and
ha
ha
how
very
odd
it
would
be
to
post
one
letters
in
one
own
one
might
really
get
a
good
deal
of
amusement
out
of
the
thought
after
business
hours
his
age
was
for
some
years
he
had
pondered
matrimony
though
without
fixing
his
affections
on
any
particular
person
it
was
plain
indeed
that
he
ought
to
marry
every
tradesman
is
made
more
respectable
by
wedlock
and
a
chemist
who
in
some
degree
resembles
a
medical
man
seems
especially
to
stand
in
need
of
the
matrimonial
guarantee
had
it
been
feasible
farmiloe
would
have
brought
a
wife
with
him
from
the
town
where
he
had
lived
for
the
past
few
years
but
he
was
in
the
difficult
position
of
knowing
not
a
single
marriageable
female
to
whom
he
could
address
himself
with
hope
or
with
natural
shyness
had
always
held
him
aloof
from
reputable
women
he
felt
that
he
could
not
recommend
himself
to
them
he
who
had
such
an
unlucky
aptitude
for
saying
the
wrong
word
or
keeping
silence
when
speech
was
demanded
with
the
men
of
his
acquaintance
he
could
relieve
his
sense
of
awkwardness
and
deficiency
by
becoming
aggressive
in
fact
he
had
a
reputation
for
cantankerousness
for
pugnacity
which
kept
most
of
his
equals
in
some
awe
of
him
and
to
perceive
this
was
one
solace
amid
many
discontents
nicely
dressed
and
and
women
above
the
class
of
domestic
servants
he
worshipped
from
afar
and
only
in
vivacious
moments
pictured
himself
as
the
wooer
of
such
a
superior
being
it
seemed
as
though
fate
could
do
nothing
with
farmiloe
at
he
suffered
the
shock
of
learning
that
a
relative
an
old
woman
to
whom
he
had
occasionally
written
as
a
matter
of
kindness
farmiloe
could
do
such
things
had
left
him
by
will
the
sum
of
it
was
strictly
a
shock
it
upset
his
health
for
several
days
and
not
for
a
week
or
two
could
he
realise
the
legacy
as
a
fact
just
when
he
was
beginning
to
look
about
him
with
a
new
air
of
confidence
the
solicitors
who
were
managing
the
little
affair
for
him
drily
acquainted
him
with
the
fact
that
his
relative
will
was
contested
by
other
kinsfolk
whom
the
old
woman
had
passed
over
on
the
ground
that
she
was
imbecile
and
incapable
of
conducting
her
affairs
there
followed
a
which
consumed
many
months
and
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
so
that
though
he
won
his
case
farmiloe
lost
all
satisfaction
in
his
improved
circumstances
and
was
only
more
embittered
against
the
world
at
large
then
no
sooner
had
he
purchased
his
business
than
he
learnt
from
smiling
neighbours
that
he
had
paid
considerably
too
much
for
it
his
predecessor
beyond
a
doubt
would
have
taken
very
much
less
had
indeed
been
on
the
point
of
doing
so
just
when
farmiloe
appeared
this
kind
of
experience
is
a
trial
to
any
man
it
threw
farmiloe
into
a
silent
rage
with
the
result
that
two
or
three
customers
who
chanced
to
enter
his
shop
declared
that
they
would
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
such
a
surly
creature
and
now
began
his
torment
a
form
of
exasperation
peculiar
to
his
dual
capacity
of
shopkeeper
and
manager
of
a
all
day
long
he
stood
on
the
watch
for
customers
literally
stood
now
behind
the
counter
now
in
front
of
it
his
eager
and
angry
eyes
turning
to
the
door
whenever
the
steps
of
a
sounded
without
if
the
door
opened
his
nerves
began
to
tingle
and
he
straightened
himself
like
a
soldier
at
attention
for
a
moment
he
suffered
an
agony
of
doubt
would
the
person
entering
turn
to
the
counter
or
to
the
and
seldom
was
his
hope
fulfilled
not
one
in
four
of
the
people
who
came
in
was
a
genuine
customer
the
always
the
a
stamp
a
card
a
newspaper
wrapper
a
a
letter
to
be
registered
anything
but
an
honest
purchase
across
the
counter
or
the
blessed
tendering
of
a
prescription
to
make
up
from
vexation
he
passed
to
annoyance
to
rage
to
fury
he
cursed
the
and
committed
to
eternal
perdition
the
man
who
had
waxed
eloquent
upon
its
advantages
of
course
he
had
hired
an
and
never
had
so
little
legitimate
occupation
resolved
not
to
pay
him
for
nothing
farmiloe
kept
him
cleaning
windows
washing
bottles
and
the
like
until
the
lad
fairly
broke
into
rebellion
if
this
was
the
sort
of
work
he
was
engaged
for
he
must
have
higher
wages
he
was
over
strong
and
his
mother
said
he
must
lead
an
life
that
was
why
he
had
taken
the
place
to
be
bearded
thus
in
his
own
shop
was
too
much
for
farmiloe
he
seized
the
opportunity
of
giving
his
wrath
full
swing
and
burst
into
a
frenzy
of
vilification
just
as
his
passion
reached
its
height
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
there
entered
a
lady
who
wished
to
make
a
large
purchase
of
disinfectants
alarmed
and
scandalised
at
what
was
going
on
she
had
no
sooner
crossed
the
threshold
than
she
turned
again
and
hurried
away
her
friends
were
not
long
in
learning
from
her
that
the
new
chemist
was
a
most
violent
man
a
most
disagreeable
person
the
very
last
man
one
could
think
of
doing
business
with
the
home
was
but
poorly
furnished
and
farmiloe
had
engaged
a
very
cheap
general
servant
who
involved
him
in
dirt
and
discomfort
it
was
a
matter
of
talk
among
the
neighbouring
tradesmen
that
the
chemist
lived
in
a
beggarly
fashion
when
the
dismissed
spread
the
story
of
how
he
had
been
used
people
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
farmiloe
drank
before
long
there
was
a
legend
that
he
had
been
suffering
from
an
acute
attack
of
delirium
tremens
the
always
the
if
he
sat
down
at
a
meal
the
clanged
and
hope
springing
eternal
he
hurried
forth
in
readiness
to
make
up
a
packet
or
concoct
a
mixture
but
it
was
an
old
lady
who
held
him
in
talk
for
ten
minutes
about
rates
of
postage
to
south
america
when
by
rare
luck
he
had
a
prescription
to
dispense
the
hideous
scrawl
of
that
pestilent
bunker
in
came
somebody
with
letters
and
parcels
which
he
was
requested
to
weigh
and
his
hand
shook
so
with
rage
that
he
could
not
resume
his
dispensing
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
people
asked
extraordinary
questions
and
were
surprised
offended
when
he
declared
he
could
not
answer
them
when
could
a
letter
be
delivered
at
a
village
on
the
coast
of
ireland
was
it
true
that
the
contemplated
a
reduction
of
rates
to
would
he
explain
in
detail
the
new
system
of
express
delivery
invariably
he
betrayed
impatience
and
occasionally
he
lost
his
temper
people
went
away
exclaiming
what
a
he
was
said
a
shopkeeper
one
day
after
receiving
a
short
answer
shall
make
it
my
business
to
complain
of
you
to
the
i
do
come
here
to
be
insulted
insulted
you
returned
farmiloe
like
a
sullen
schoolboy
you
did
and
you
are
always
doing
it
not
are
i
did
terror
stole
upon
the
chemist
heart
did
mean
it
and
i
i
sure
i
apologise
it
a
way
i
have
damned
bad
way
let
me
tell
you
i
advise
you
to
get
out
of
it
sorry
you
should
be
and
the
tradesman
walked
off
only
half
appeased
farmiloe
could
have
shed
tears
in
his
mortification
and
for
some
minutes
he
stood
looking
at
a
bottle
of
laudanum
wishing
he
had
the
courage
to
have
done
with
life
plainly
he
could
not
live
very
long
unless
things
improved
his
ready
money
was
coming
to
an
end
rents
and
taxes
loomed
before
him
an
awful
thought
of
bankruptcy
haunted
him
in
the
early
morning
hours
the
most
frequent
visitor
to
the
was
a
man
who
spoke
civilly
and
did
his
business
in
the
fewest
possible
words
farmiloe
rather
liked
the
look
of
him
and
once
or
twice
made
conversational
overtures
but
with
no
encouraging
result
one
day
feeling
bolder
than
usual
the
chemist
ventured
to
speak
what
he
had
in
mind
after
supplying
the
grave
gentleman
with
stamps
and
he
said
in
a
tone
meant
to
be
conciliatory
do
know
whether
you
ever
have
need
of
mineral
waters
sir
yes
sometimes
my
ordinary
tradesman
supplies
them
thought
i
just
mention
that
i
keep
them
in
stock
thank
you
noticed
went
on
the
luckless
apothecary
his
bosom
heaving
with
a
sense
of
his
wrongs
you
a
pretty
large
customer
of
the
and
it
seems
to
me
he
meant
to
speak
jocosely
it
would
be
only
fair
if
you
gave
a
turn
now
and
then
i
get
next
to
nothing
out
of
you
know
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
the
man
of
few
words
was
looking
at
him
half
in
surprise
half
in
indignation
and
when
the
chemist
blundered
into
silence
he
spoke
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
little
purchase
in
your
shop
but
i
decidedly
object
to
this
kind
of
behaviour
and
shall
make
my
purchase
elsewhere
he
strode
solemnly
into
the
street
and
farmiloe
unconscious
of
all
about
him
glared
at
vacancy
whether
from
the
angry
tradesman
or
from
some
lady
with
whom
farmiloe
had
been
abrupt
a
complaint
did
presently
reach
the
postal
authorities
with
the
result
that
an
official
called
at
the
chemist
shop
the
interview
was
unpleasant
it
happened
that
farmiloe
not
for
the
first
time
had
just
then
allowed
himself
to
run
out
of
certain
things
always
in
demand
by
the
public
halfpenny
stamps
for
instance
moreover
his
accounts
were
not
in
perfect
order
this
he
had
to
hear
was
emphatically
unbusinesslike
and
in
brief
would
not
do
shall
not
occur
again
sir
mumbled
the
unhappy
man
if
you
consider
my
position
farmiloe
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
this
is
a
matter
for
your
consideration
and
no
one
else
sir
quite
true
still
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
i
assure
you
only
assurance
i
want
is
that
the
business
of
the
will
be
properly
attended
to
and
that
assurance
i
must
have
i
shall
probably
call
again
before
long
good
morning
it
was
always
with
a
savage
satisfaction
that
farmiloe
heard
the
clock
strike
eight
on
saturday
evening
his
shop
remained
open
till
ten
but
at
eight
came
the
end
of
the
business
if
as
happened
any
one
entered
five
minutes
too
late
it
delighted
him
to
refuse
their
request
these
were
the
only
moments
in
which
he
felt
himself
a
free
man
after
eating
his
poor
supper
he
smoked
a
pipe
or
two
of
cheap
tobacco
brooding
or
he
fingered
the
pages
of
his
menacing
or
very
rarely
he
walked
about
the
dark
country
roads
asking
himself
with
many
a
gesture
and
ejaculation
why
he
could
not
get
on
like
other
men
one
afternoon
it
seemed
that
he
at
length
had
his
chance
there
entered
a
maidservant
with
a
prescription
to
be
made
up
and
sent
as
soon
as
possible
a
glance
at
the
name
delighted
farmiloe
it
was
that
of
the
richest
family
in
the
suburbs
the
medicine
to
be
sure
was
only
for
a
governess
but
his
existence
was
recognised
and
the
patronage
of
such
people
would
do
him
good
but
for
the
handwriting
of
bunker
the
prescription
offered
no
difficulty
rubbing
his
palms
together
and
smiling
as
he
seldom
smiled
he
told
the
domestic
that
the
medicine
should
be
delivered
in
less
than
half
an
hour
scarcely
had
he
begun
upon
it
when
a
lady
came
in
a
lady
whom
he
knew
well
her
business
was
at
the
side
and
she
looked
a
peremptory
demand
for
his
attention
inwardly
furious
he
crossed
the
shop
so
good
as
to
tell
me
what
this
will
cost
by
it
seemed
to
be
a
pamphlet
giving
a
glance
at
one
of
the
open
ends
farmiloe
saw
handwriting
within
and
his
hostility
to
the
woman
found
vent
in
a
sharp
remark
a
written
communication
in
this
it
will
be
letter
rate
the
lady
eyed
him
with
terrible
scorn
will
oblige
me
by
minding
your
own
business
your
remark
is
the
merest
impertinence
that
packet
consists
of
and
will
therefore
go
at
book
rate
be
so
good
as
to
weigh
it
at
once
farmiloe
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
screamed
madam
i
will
weigh
it
and
let
me
inform
you
as
you
are
so
ignorant
that
to
weigh
packets
is
not
part
of
my
duty
i
do
it
merely
to
oblige
civil
persons
and
you
madam
are
not
one
of
them
the
lady
instantly
turned
and
withdrew
the
yelled
farmiloe
alone
with
his
and
shaking
his
fist
in
the
air
very
day
i
write
to
give
it
up
i
say
the
he
returned
to
his
dispensing
completed
it
wrapped
up
the
bottle
in
the
customary
manner
and
despatched
the
boy
to
the
house
five
minutes
later
a
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
which
put
him
in
a
cold
sweat
he
happened
to
glance
along
the
shelf
from
which
he
had
taken
the
bottle
containing
the
last
ingredient
of
the
mixture
and
it
struck
him
with
all
the
force
of
a
horrible
doubt
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
irate
confusion
of
his
thoughts
he
had
done
the
dispensing
almost
mechanically
the
bottle
he
ought
to
have
taken
down
was
but
had
he
not
actually
poured
from
that
other
of
poisoning
there
was
no
fear
but
if
indeed
he
had
made
a
slip
the
result
would
be
a
very
extraordinary
mixture
so
surprising
in
fact
that
the
patient
would
be
sure
to
speak
to
bunker
about
it
good
heavens
he
felt
sure
he
had
made
the
mistake
any
other
man
would
have
taken
down
the
two
bottles
in
question
and
have
examined
the
mouths
of
them
for
traces
of
moisture
farmiloe
a
victim
of
destiny
could
do
nothing
so
reasonable
heedless
of
the
fact
that
his
shop
remained
unguarded
he
seized
his
hat
and
rushed
after
the
if
he
could
only
have
a
sniff
at
the
mixture
it
would
either
confirm
his
fear
or
set
his
mind
at
rest
he
tore
along
the
road
and
was
too
late
the
boy
met
him
having
just
completed
his
errand
with
a
wild
curse
he
sped
to
the
house
he
rushed
to
the
tradesman
door
the
medicine
just
delivered
he
must
examine
it
he
feared
there
was
a
mistake
an
extraordinary
oversight
the
bottle
had
not
yet
been
upstairs
farmiloe
tore
off
the
wrapper
wrenched
out
the
cork
sniffed
and
smiled
feebly
you
i
glad
to
find
there
was
mistake
i
take
it
back
and
have
it
wrapped
up
again
and
send
it
immediately
immediately
and
by
the
bye
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
still
smiling
like
a
detected
culprit
sure
you
wo
mention
this
little
affair
a
new
assistant
of
mine
stupid
fellow
i
am
going
to
get
rid
of
him
at
once
thank
you
thank
you
notwithstanding
that
the
incident
was
of
course
talked
of
through
the
house
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
next
day
it
was
the
gossip
of
the
suburbs
and
the
day
after
the
city
itself
heard
the
story
people
were
alarmed
and
scandalised
why
such
a
chemist
was
a
public
danger
one
lady
declared
that
he
ought
at
once
to
be
off
the
roll
and
so
in
a
sense
he
was
another
month
and
the
flowery
bowery
little
suburb
knew
him
no
more
he
hid
himself
in
a
great
town
living
on
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
whilst
he
sought
a
place
as
an
assistant
a
leaky
pair
of
boots
and
a
bad
east
wind
found
the
vulnerable
spot
of
his
constitution
after
all
there
was
just
enough
money
left
to
bury
him
topham
chance
chapter
i
on
a
summer
afternoon
two
surly
men
sat
together
in
a
london
lodging
one
of
them
occupied
an
smoked
a
cigarette
and
read
the
newspaper
the
other
was
seated
at
the
table
with
a
mass
of
papers
before
him
on
which
he
laboured
as
though
correcting
exercises
they
were
much
of
an
age
and
that
about
thirty
but
whereas
the
idler
was
well
dressed
his
companion
had
a
seedy
appearance
and
looked
altogether
like
a
man
who
neglected
himself
for
half
an
hour
they
had
not
spoken
of
a
sudden
the
man
in
the
chair
jumped
up
i
have
to
go
into
town
he
said
gruffly
it
uncertain
when
i
shall
be
back
get
that
stuff
cleared
off
and
reply
to
the
urgent
letters
mind
you
write
in
the
proper
tone
to
dixon
as
soapy
as
you
can
make
it
tell
miss
brewer
we
ca
reduce
the
fees
but
that
we
give
her
credit
for
a
month
guarantee
the
leicestershire
fellow
a
pass
if
he
begins
at
once
the
other
who
listened
bit
the
end
of
his
wooden
penholder
to
splinters
right
he
replied
look
here
i
want
a
little
money
do
i
but
you
not
like
me
without
a
coin
in
your
pocket
look
here
give
me
i
have
absolute
need
of
it
why
i
ca
even
get
my
hair
cut
i
sick
of
this
slavery
go
and
do
better
cried
the
man
insolently
were
glad
enough
of
the
job
when
i
offered
it
to
you
it
no
good
your
looking
to
me
for
money
i
can
do
no
more
myself
than
just
live
and
as
soon
as
i
see
a
chance
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
clear
out
of
this
rotten
business
he
moved
towards
the
door
but
before
opening
it
stood
hesitating
to
get
your
hair
cut
do
you
well
there
sixpence
and
it
all
i
can
spare
the
door
closed
and
the
man
at
the
table
leaning
back
stared
gloomily
at
the
sixpenny
piece
on
the
table
before
him
his
name
was
topham
he
had
a
university
degree
and
a
damaged
reputation
six
months
ago
when
his
choice
seemed
to
be
between
staying
in
the
streets
and
turning
luck
had
made
him
acquainted
with
rudolph
starkey
who
wrote
himself
of
dublin
university
and
advertised
a
system
of
tuition
by
correspondence
in
return
for
mere
board
and
lodging
topham
became
starkey
assistant
that
is
to
say
he
did
by
far
the
greater
part
of
starkey
work
the
tutorial
business
was
but
moderately
successful
still
it
kept
its
proprietor
in
cigarettes
and
enabled
him
to
pass
some
hours
a
day
at
a
club
where
he
was
convinced
that
before
long
some
better
chance
in
life
would
offer
itself
to
him
having
always
been
a
lazy
dog
starkey
regarded
himself
as
an
example
of
industry
unrewarded
being
as
selfish
a
fellow
as
one
could
meet
he
reproached
himself
with
the
unworldliness
of
his
nature
which
had
so
hindered
him
in
a
basely
material
age
one
of
his
ventures
was
a
little
volume
entitled
in
had
it
been
either
more
moral
or
more
practical
this
book
would
probably
have
yielded
him
a
modest
income
for
such
works
are
dear
to
the
british
public
but
rudolph
starkey
was
one
of
those
men
who
do
everything
by
halves
and
snarl
over
the
ineffectual
results
topham
fault
was
that
of
a
man
who
had
followed
his
instincts
but
too
thoroughly
they
brought
him
to
an
end
of
everything
and
as
starkey
said
he
had
been
glad
enough
to
take
the
employment
which
was
offered
without
any
inconvenient
inquiries
the
work
which
he
undertook
he
did
competently
and
honestly
for
some
time
without
a
grumble
beginning
with
a
certain
gratitude
to
his
employer
though
without
any
liking
he
soon
grew
to
detest
the
man
and
had
much
ado
to
keep
up
a
show
of
decent
civility
in
their
intercourse
of
better
birth
and
breeding
than
starkey
he
burned
with
resentment
at
the
scant
ceremony
with
which
he
was
treated
and
loathed
the
meanness
which
could
exact
so
much
toil
for
such
poor
remuneration
when
offering
his
terms
starkey
had
talked
in
that
bland
way
characteristic
of
him
with
strangers
really
ashamed
to
propose
nothing
better
to
a
man
of
your
standing
but
well
i
making
a
start
you
see
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
just
at
present
i
could
very
well
manage
to
do
all
the
work
myself
still
if
you
think
it
worth
your
while
there
no
doubt
we
shall
get
on
capitally
together
and
of
course
i
need
not
say
as
soon
as
our
progress
justifies
it
we
must
come
to
new
arrangements
a
matter
of
six
or
seven
hours
a
day
will
be
all
i
shall
ask
of
you
at
present
for
my
own
part
i
work
chiefly
at
night
chapter
ii
by
the
end
of
the
first
month
topham
was
working
not
six
or
seven
but
ten
or
twelve
hours
a
day
and
his
spells
of
labour
only
lengthened
as
time
went
on
seeing
himself
victimised
he
one
day
alluded
to
the
promise
of
better
terms
but
starkey
turned
sour
surprise
me
topham
here
are
we
practically
partners
doing
our
best
to
make
this
thing
a
success
and
all
at
once
you
spring
upon
me
an
unreasonable
demand
you
know
how
expensive
these
rooms
are
for
we
must
have
a
decent
address
if
you
are
dissatisfied
say
so
and
give
me
time
to
look
out
for
some
one
else
topham
was
afraid
of
the
street
and
that
his
employer
well
knew
the
conversation
ended
in
mutual
sullenness
which
thenceforward
became
the
note
of
their
colloquies
starkey
felt
himself
a
victim
of
ingratitude
and
consequently
threw
even
more
work
upon
his
helpless
assistant
that
the
work
was
so
conscientiously
done
did
not
at
all
astonish
him
now
and
then
he
gave
himself
the
satisfaction
of
finding
fault
just
to
remind
topham
that
his
bread
depended
on
another
goodwill
congenial
indolence
grew
upon
him
but
he
talked
only
the
more
of
his
ceaseless
exertions
sometimes
in
the
evening
he
would
throw
up
his
arms
yawn
wearily
and
declare
that
so
much
toil
with
such
paltry
results
was
a
thing
topham
stared
sullenly
at
the
sixpence
this
was
but
the
latest
of
many
insults
yet
never
before
had
he
so
tasted
the
shame
of
his
subjection
though
he
was
earning
a
living
and
a
right
to
more
strenuously
than
starkey
ever
had
this
fellow
made
him
feel
like
a
mendicant
his
nerves
quivered
he
struck
the
table
fiercely
shouting
within
himself
cad
then
he
pocketed
the
coin
and
got
on
with
his
duties
it
was
toil
of
a
peculiarly
wearisome
and
enervating
kind
advertisements
which
were
chiefly
in
the
country
newspapers
put
him
in
communication
with
persons
of
both
sexes
and
of
any
age
from
seventeen
onwards
the
characteristic
common
to
them
all
being
inexperience
and
intellectual
helplessness
most
of
these
correspondents
desired
to
pass
some
examination
a
few
aimed
or
professed
to
aim
merely
at
or
what
they
called
starkey
of
course
undertook
tuition
in
any
subject
to
any
end
stipulating
only
that
his
fees
should
be
paid
in
advance
throughout
the
day
his
slave
had
been
correcting
latin
and
greek
exercises
papers
in
mathematical
or
physical
science
answers
to
historical
questions
all
elementary
and
many
grotesquely
bad
on
completing
each
set
he
wrote
the
expected
comment
sometimes
briefly
sometimes
at
considerable
length
he
now
turned
to
a
bundle
of
essays
and
on
opening
the
first
could
not
repress
a
groan
no
this
was
beyond
his
strength
he
would
make
up
the
parcels
for
post
write
the
letters
that
must
be
sent
and
go
out
had
he
not
sixpence
in
his
pocket
just
as
he
had
taken
this
resolve
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
and
with
the
inattention
of
a
man
who
expects
nothing
topham
bade
enter
asking
for
starkey
sir
said
the
servant
right
send
him
in
and
then
entered
a
man
whose
years
seemed
to
be
something
short
of
fifty
a
hale
stoutish
man
whose
dress
and
bearing
made
it
probable
that
he
was
no
londoner
starkey
he
inquired
rather
nervously
though
his
smile
and
his
upright
posture
did
not
lack
a
certain
dignity
right
murmured
topham
who
was
authorised
to
represent
his
principal
to
any
one
coming
on
business
you
take
a
seat
will
know
my
name
began
the
stranger
abraham
wigmore
glad
to
meet
you
wigmore
i
was
on
the
point
of
sending
your
last
batch
of
papers
to
the
post
you
will
find
this
time
i
have
been
able
to
praise
them
unreservedly
the
listener
fairly
blushed
with
delight
then
he
grasped
his
short
beard
with
his
left
hand
and
laughed
silently
showing
excellent
teeth
starkey
he
replied
at
length
in
a
moderately
subdued
voice
did
really
think
i
managed
better
than
usual
but
there
much
thanks
due
to
you
sir
you
helped
me
starkey
you
really
have
and
that
one
reason
why
happening
to
come
up
to
london
i
wished
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
i
really
did
want
to
thank
you
sir
chapter
iii
topham
was
closely
observing
this
singular
visitor
he
had
always
taken
wigmore
for
a
youth
of
nineteen
or
so
some
not
but
plodding
and
earnest
clerk
or
in
the
little
gloucestershire
town
from
which
the
correspondent
wrote
it
astonished
him
to
see
this
mature
and
most
respectable
person
they
talked
on
wigmore
had
a
slight
accent
but
otherwise
his
language
differed
little
from
that
of
the
normally
educated
in
every
word
he
revealed
a
good
and
kindly
if
simple
nature
at
length
a
slight
embarrassment
interfered
with
the
flow
of
his
talk
which
having
been
solely
of
tuitional
matters
began
to
take
a
turn
more
personal
was
he
taking
too
much
of
starkey
time
reassured
on
this
point
he
begged
leave
to
give
some
account
of
himself
dare
say
starkey
you
surprised
to
see
how
old
i
am
it
seems
strange
to
you
no
doubt
that
at
my
age
i
should
be
going
to
school
he
grasped
his
beard
and
laughed
it
is
strange
and
i
like
to
explain
it
to
you
to
begin
with
i
tell
you
what
my
age
is
only
that
but
i
the
father
of
two
daughters
both
married
yes
i
was
married
young
myself
and
my
good
wife
died
long
ago
more
the
pity
he
paused
looked
round
the
room
stroked
his
hat
topham
murmuring
a
sympathetic
sound
as
to
my
business
starkey
i
a
fruiterer
and
greengrocer
i
might
have
said
fruiterer
alone
it
sounds
more
respectable
but
the
honest
truth
is
i
do
sell
vegetables
as
well
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
starkey
does
it
make
you
feel
ashamed
of
me
dear
sir
what
business
could
be
more
honourable
i
heartily
wish
i
had
one
as
good
and
as
lucrative
that
your
kindness
sir
said
wigmore
with
a
pleased
smile
fact
is
i
have
done
pretty
well
though
i
not
by
any
means
a
rich
man
comfortable
that
all
i
gave
my
girls
a
good
schooling
and
what
with
that
and
their
good
looks
they
both
made
what
may
be
called
better
marriages
than
might
have
been
expected
for
down
in
our
country
you
know
sir
a
shopkeeper
is
one
thing
and
a
gentleman
another
now
my
girls
have
married
gentlemen
again
he
paused
and
with
emphasis
again
topham
murmured
this
time
congratulation
of
them
is
wife
to
a
young
solicitor
the
other
to
a
young
gentleman
farmer
and
they
both
gone
to
live
in
another
part
of
the
country
i
dare
say
you
understand
that
mr
starkey
the
speaker
eyes
had
fallen
at
the
same
time
a
twitching
of
the
brows
and
hardening
of
the
mouth
changed
the
expression
of
his
face
marking
it
with
an
unexpected
sadness
all
but
pain
you
mean
wigmore
asked
topham
your
daughters
desire
to
live
at
a
distance
from
you
i
sorry
to
say
that
what
i
do
mean
starkey
my
the
solicitor
had
intended
practising
in
the
town
where
he
was
born
instead
of
that
he
went
to
another
a
long
way
off
my
the
gentleman
farmer
was
to
have
taken
a
farm
close
by
us
he
altered
his
mind
and
went
into
another
county
you
see
sir
it
quite
natural
i
find
no
fault
there
never
been
an
unkind
word
between
any
of
us
but
he
was
growing
more
and
more
embarrassed
evidently
the
man
had
something
he
wished
to
say
something
to
which
he
had
been
leading
up
by
this
disclosure
of
his
domestic
affairs
but
he
could
not
utter
his
thoughts
topham
tried
the
commonplaces
naturally
suggested
by
the
situation
they
were
received
with
gratitude
but
still
wigmore
hung
his
head
and
talked
vaguely
with
hesitations
pauses
always
been
what
one
may
call
starkey
as
a
boy
i
liked
reading
and
i
always
had
a
book
at
hand
for
my
leisure
time
the
kind
of
book
that
does
one
good
just
now
i
reading
christian
and
since
my
daughters
married
well
as
i
tell
you
starkey
i
done
pretty
well
in
business
there
really
no
reason
why
i
should
keep
on
in
my
shop
if
i
chose
to
to
do
otherwise
quite
understand
interrupted
topham
in
whom
there
began
to
stir
a
thought
which
made
his
brain
warm
would
like
to
retire
from
business
and
you
would
like
to
well
to
pursue
your
studies
more
seriously
again
wigmore
looked
grateful
but
even
yet
the
burden
was
not
off
his
mind
know
he
resumed
presently
turning
his
hat
round
and
round
it
sounds
a
strange
thing
to
say
but
well
sir
i
always
done
my
best
to
live
as
a
religious
man
that
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
mr
wigmore
then
sir
what
i
should
like
to
ask
you
is
this
do
you
think
if
i
gave
up
the
shop
and
worked
very
hard
at
my
studies
with
help
of
course
with
help
do
you
think
starkey
that
i
could
hope
to
get
on
he
was
red
as
a
peony
his
voice
choked
mean
put
in
topham
he
too
becoming
excited
become
a
really
man
sir
yes
but
more
than
that
i
want
starkey
to
make
myself
something
so
that
my
daughters
and
my
would
never
feel
ashamed
of
me
so
that
their
children
wo
be
afraid
to
talk
of
their
grandfather
i
know
it
a
very
bold
thought
sir
but
if
i
could
wigmore
cried
topham
quivering
with
curiosity
more
plainly
what
do
you
wish
to
become
with
competent
help
of
course
with
competent
help
anything
is
possible
exclaimed
the
other
mean
that
starkey
then
sir
he
leaned
forward
blushing
trembling
gasping
i
get
to
be
a
curate
topham
fell
back
into
his
chair
for
two
or
three
minutes
he
was
mute
with
astonishment
then
the
very
soul
of
him
sang
jubilee
dear
wigmore
he
began
restraining
himself
to
an
impressive
gravity
should
be
the
last
man
to
speak
lightly
of
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
or
to
urge
any
one
to
enter
the
church
whom
i
thought
unfitted
for
the
sacred
office
but
in
your
case
my
good
sir
there
can
be
no
such
misgiving
i
entertain
no
doubt
whatever
of
your
fitness
your
moral
fitness
and
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
with
competent
aid
you
might
in
no
very
long
time
be
prepared
for
the
necessary
examination
the
listener
laughed
with
delight
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
all
diffidence
subdued
he
told
how
the
idea
had
first
come
to
him
how
he
had
brooded
upon
it
how
he
had
worked
at
elementary
very
secretly
then
how
the
sight
of
starkey
advertisement
had
inspired
him
with
hope
to
get
to
be
a
curate
that
all
i
should
never
be
worthy
of
being
a
vicar
or
a
rector
i
do
look
so
high
as
that
starkey
but
a
curate
is
a
clergyman
and
for
my
daughters
to
be
able
to
say
their
father
is
in
the
church
that
would
be
a
good
thing
sir
a
good
thing
he
slapped
his
knee
and
again
laughed
with
joy
meanwhile
topham
seemed
to
have
become
pensive
his
head
was
on
his
hand
he
murmured
at
length
i
had
time
to
work
seriously
with
you
several
hours
a
day
wigmore
looked
at
him
and
let
his
eyes
fall
are
of
course
very
busy
mr
starkey
busy
topham
waved
his
hand
at
the
table
and
appeared
to
sink
into
despondency
thereupon
wigmore
cautiously
and
delicately
approached
the
next
thought
he
had
in
mind
topham
cunning
fellow
at
one
moment
facilitating
at
another
retarding
what
he
wished
to
say
it
came
out
at
last
would
it
be
quite
impossible
for
starkey
to
devote
himself
to
one
sole
pupil
chapter
iv
wigmore
i
will
be
frank
with
you
if
i
asked
an
equivalent
for
the
value
of
my
business
as
a
business
i
could
not
expect
you
to
agree
to
such
a
proposal
but
to
speak
honestly
my
health
has
suffered
a
good
deal
from
overwork
and
i
must
take
into
consideration
the
great
probability
that
in
any
case
before
long
i
shall
be
obliged
to
find
some
position
where
the
duties
were
less
exhausting
gracious
exclaimed
the
listener
you
kill
yoursel
sir
and
i
bound
to
say
you
look
far
from
well
topham
smiled
pathetically
paused
a
moment
as
if
to
reflect
and
continued
in
the
same
tone
of
genial
confidence
let
us
consider
the
matter
in
detail
do
you
propose
wigmore
to
withdraw
from
business
at
once
the
fruiterer
replied
that
he
could
do
so
at
very
short
notice
questioned
as
to
his
wishes
regarding
a
place
of
residence
he
declared
that
he
was
ready
to
live
in
any
place
where
being
unknown
he
could
make
as
it
were
a
new
beginning
would
not
feel
impatient
said
topham
say
two
or
three
years
had
to
elapse
before
you
could
be
ordained
said
the
other
cheerily
if
it
took
ten
years
i
would
go
through
with
it
when
i
make
up
my
mind
about
a
thing
i
not
easily
dismayed
if
i
could
have
your
help
sir
the
necessity
of
making
a
definite
proposal
turned
topham
pale
he
was
so
afraid
of
asking
too
much
almost
in
spite
of
himself
he
at
length
spoke
we
say
if
i
reside
with
you
that
you
pay
me
a
salary
of
well
a
year
the
next
moment
he
inwardly
raged
wigmore
countenance
expressed
such
contentment
that
it
was
plain
the
good
man
would
have
paid
twice
that
sum
cried
topham
in
his
mind
always
undervalue
myself
it
was
late
that
evening
when
starkey
came
home
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
topham
was
later
still
in
vain
he
sat
writing
until
past
one
topham
did
not
appear
and
indeed
never
came
back
at
all
the
overworked
corresponding
tutor
was
taking
his
ease
at
the
seaside
on
the
strength
of
a
quarter
salary
in
advance
which
wigmore
tremulously
anxious
to
clinch
their
bargain
had
insisted
on
paying
him
before
leaving
london
he
had
written
to
starkey
apologising
for
his
abrupt
departure
result
of
unforeseen
circumstances
he
enclosed
six
penny
stamps
in
repayment
of
a
sum
lent
and
added
i
think
of
my
great
debt
to
you
i
despair
of
expressing
my
gratitude
be
assured
however
that
the
name
of
starkey
will
always
be
cherished
in
my
remembrance
under
that
name
topham
dwelt
with
the
retired
shopkeeper
and
assiduously
discharged
his
tutorial
duties
a
day
came
when
relying
upon
the
friendship
between
them
and
his
pupil
exultation
in
the
progress
achieved
the
tutor
unbosomed
himself
having
heard
the
whole
story
wigmore
laughed
a
great
deal
and
declared
that
such
a
fellow
as
starkey
was
rightly
served
he
inquired
after
reflection
was
it
the
man
never
wrote
to
ask
why
i
sent
no
more
work
asks
for
further
confession
while
at
the
seaside
i
wrote
in
a
disguised
hand
a
letter
supposed
to
come
from
a
brother
of
yours
in
which
i
said
you
were
very
ill
and
must
cease
your
correspondence
starkey
the
decency
to
reply
but
if
he
had
done
so
i
should
have
got
his
letter
at
the
wigmore
looked
troubled
for
a
moment
however
this
too
was
laughed
away
and
the
pursuit
of
gentility
went
on
as
rigorously
as
ever
but
topham
musing
over
his
good
luck
thought
with
a
shiver
on
how
small
an
accident
it
had
depended
had
starkey
been
at
home
when
the
fruiterer
called
he
it
was
plain
would
have
had
the
offer
of
this
engagement
the
result
that
dear
old
wigmore
would
have
been
bled
for
who
knows
how
many
years
by
a
mere
swindler
whereas
he
is
really
being
educated
and
for
all
i
know
may
some
day
adorn
the
church
of
england
such
thoughts
are
very
consoling
a
lodger
in
maze
pond
harvey
munden
had
settled
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
club
with
a
cigar
and
a
review
at
eleven
on
a
saturday
morning
in
august
he
might
reasonably
expect
to
be
undisturbed
but
behold
there
entered
a
bore
a
man
with
a
yellow
waistcoat
much
dreaded
by
all
the
members
he
stood
a
while
at
one
of
the
tables
fingering
newspapers
and
eyeing
the
solitary
harvey
heard
a
step
looked
up
and
shuddered
the
bore
began
his
attack
in
form
harvey
parried
with
as
much
resolution
as
his
kindly
nature
permitted
know
that
shergold
is
dying
fell
casually
from
the
imperturbable
man
munden
was
startled
into
attention
and
the
full
flow
of
gossip
swept
about
him
yes
the
great
shergold
lay
dying
there
were
bulletins
in
the
morning
papers
it
seemed
unlikely
that
he
would
see
another
dawn
will
benefit
by
his
decease
inquired
the
bore
nephew
do
you
think
possibly
remarkable
man
that
a
remarkable
man
he
was
at
lady
the
other
evening
and
he
talked
a
good
deal
upon
my
word
it
reminded
one
of
coleridge
or
macaulay
that
kind
of
thing
certainly
most
brilliant
talk
i
ca
remember
what
it
was
all
about
something
literary
a
sort
of
fantasia
do
you
know
wonderful
eloquence
by
the
bye
i
believe
he
is
a
great
friend
of
yours
we
have
known
each
other
for
a
long
time
was
saying
that
he
had
gone
in
for
medicine
walking
one
of
the
hospitals
that
kind
of
thing
he
at
guy
to
avoid
infinite
questioning
harvey
flung
aside
his
review
and
went
to
glance
at
the
he
read
the
news
concerning
the
great
physician
then
as
his
pursuer
drew
near
again
he
hastily
departed
by
midday
he
was
at
london
bridge
he
crossed
to
the
surrey
side
turned
immediately
to
the
left
and
at
a
short
distance
entered
one
of
the
vaulted
thoroughfares
which
run
beneath
london
bridge
station
it
was
like
the
mouth
of
some
monstrous
cavern
out
of
glaring
daylight
he
passed
into
gloom
and
chill
air
on
either
side
of
the
way
a
row
of
suspended
lamps
gave
a
dull
yellow
light
revealing
entrances
to
vast
storehouses
most
of
them
occupied
by
wine
merchants
an
alcoholic
smell
prevailed
over
indeterminate
odours
of
dampness
there
was
great
concourse
of
drays
and
waggons
wheels
and
the
clang
of
giant
hoofs
made
roaring
echo
and
above
thundered
the
trains
the
vaults
barely
illumined
with
seemed
of
infinite
extent
dim
figures
moved
near
and
far
amid
huge
barrels
cases
packages
in
rooms
partitioned
off
by
glass
framework
men
sat
writing
a
curve
in
the
tunnel
made
it
appear
much
longer
than
it
really
was
till
midway
nothing
could
be
seen
ahead
but
deepening
darkness
then
of
a
sudden
appeared
the
issue
and
beyond
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
any
one
who
should
have
ventured
hither
for
the
first
time
was
a
vision
of
magnificent
golden
in
the
august
sunshine
one
of
the
abrupt
contrasts
which
are
so
frequent
in
london
and
which
make
its
charm
for
those
who
wander
from
the
beaten
tracks
a
transition
from
the
clangorous
cave
of
commerce
to
a
sunny
leafy
quietude
amid
old
houses
some
with
quaint
tumbling
roofs
and
byways
little
frequented
the
planes
grow
at
the
back
of
guy
hospital
and
close
by
is
a
short
narrow
street
which
bears
the
name
of
maze
pond
it
consists
for
the
most
part
of
homely
dwellings
where
lodgings
are
let
to
medical
students
at
one
of
these
houses
harvey
munden
plied
the
knocker
he
was
answered
by
a
trim
rather
girl
who
smiled
familiarly
shergold
is
in
sir
she
said
at
once
anticipating
his
question
he
be
very
soon
will
you
step
in
and
wait
think
i
will
as
one
who
knew
the
house
he
went
upstairs
and
entered
a
on
the
first
floor
the
girl
followed
him
have
had
time
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
things
she
said
speaking
rapidly
and
with
an
air
shergold
was
late
this
mornin
he
did
get
up
till
nearly
ten
an
then
he
sat
writin
letters
did
he
know
as
you
was
comin
sir
i
looked
in
on
the
chance
of
finding
him
or
learning
where
he
was
sure
he
be
in
about
twelve
he
said
to
me
as
he
was
only
goin
to
get
a
breath
of
air
he
has
nothing
to
do
at
the
just
now
he
talked
of
going
away
away
the
girl
repeated
the
words
sharply
and
examined
the
speaker
face
he
wo
be
goin
away
just
yet
i
think
munden
returned
her
look
with
a
certain
curiosity
and
watched
her
as
she
began
to
clink
together
the
things
upon
the
table
obviously
she
esteemed
herself
a
person
of
some
importance
her
figure
was
not
bad
and
her
features
had
the
trivial
prettiness
so
commonly
seen
in
london
girls
of
the
lower
orders
the
kind
of
prettiness
which
ultimately
loses
itself
in
fat
and
chronic
perspiration
her
complexion
already
began
to
show
a
tendency
to
muddiness
and
when
her
lips
parted
they
showed
decay
of
teeth
in
dress
she
was
untidy
her
hair
exhibited
a
futile
attempt
at
elaborate
arrangement
she
had
dirty
hands
disposed
to
talk
she
lingered
as
long
as
possible
but
harvey
munden
had
no
leanings
to
this
kind
of
colloquy
when
the
girl
took
herself
off
he
drew
a
breath
of
satisfaction
and
smiled
the
smile
of
an
intellectual
man
who
has
outlived
youthful
follies
he
stepped
over
to
the
lodger
bookcase
there
were
about
a
hundred
volumes
only
a
handful
of
them
connected
with
medical
study
seeing
a
volume
of
his
own
munden
took
it
down
and
idly
turned
the
pages
it
surprised
him
to
discover
a
great
many
marginal
notes
in
pencil
and
an
examination
of
these
showed
him
that
shergold
must
have
gone
carefully
through
the
book
with
an
eye
to
the
correction
of
its
style
adjectives
were
deleted
and
inserted
words
of
common
usage
removed
for
others
which
only
a
fine
literary
conscience
could
supply
and
in
places
even
the
punctuation
was
minutely
changed
whilst
he
still
pondered
this
singular
manifestation
of
critical
zeal
the
door
opened
and
shergold
came
in
a
man
of
short
ungraceful
with
features
as
little
commonplace
as
can
be
imagined
he
had
somewhat
a
stern
look
and
on
his
brow
were
furrows
of
care
eyes
tended
to
modify
the
all
but
harshness
of
his
lower
face
when
he
smiled
as
on
recognising
his
friend
they
expressed
a
wonderful
innocence
and
suavity
of
nature
overshadowed
in
thoughtful
or
troubled
mood
by
his
heavy
eyebrows
they
became
deeply
pathetic
his
nose
was
short
and
flat
yet
somehow
not
ignoble
his
full
lips
bare
of
moustache
tended
to
suggest
a
melancholy
fretfulness
but
for
the
high
forehead
no
casual
observer
would
have
cared
to
look
at
him
a
second
time
but
that
upper
story
made
the
whole
countenance
vivid
with
intellect
as
though
a
light
beamed
upon
it
from
above
hypercritical
beggar
cried
harvey
turning
with
the
volume
in
his
hand
this
how
you
treat
the
glorious
works
of
your
contemporaries
shergold
reddened
and
was
mute
shall
take
this
away
with
me
pursued
the
other
laughing
be
worth
a
little
study
dear
fellow
you
wo
take
it
ill
of
me
i
did
really
mean
it
as
a
criticism
the
deep
musical
voice
stammered
in
serious
embarrassment
was
it
just
this
kind
of
thing
that
caused
a
quarrel
between
george
sand
and
musset
yes
but
george
sand
was
such
a
peremptory
fellow
and
musset
such
a
vapourish
young
person
look
i
show
you
what
i
meant
said
munden
can
find
that
out
for
myself
he
thrust
the
book
into
his
came
to
ask
you
if
you
are
aware
of
your
condition
course
i
am
did
you
see
him
last
him
shergold
eyes
wandered
vaguely
to
talk
with
him
about
a
month
ago
you
part
friendly
excellent
terms
and
last
night
i
went
to
ask
after
him
unfortunately
he
did
know
any
one
but
the
nurse
said
he
had
been
mentioning
my
name
and
in
a
kind
way
had
you
better
walk
in
that
direction
this
afternoon
perhaps
i
had
and
yet
you
know
i
hate
to
have
it
supposed
that
i
am
hovering
about
him
the
same
go
shergold
pointed
to
a
chair
down
a
bit
i
have
been
having
a
talk
with
salmon
he
discourages
me
a
good
deal
you
know
it
far
from
certain
that
i
shall
go
on
with
medicine
from
certain
the
other
assented
smiling
the
bye
i
hear
that
you
have
been
in
the
world
of
late
you
were
at
lady
teasdale
not
long
ago
yes
why
not
perhaps
it
was
partly
his
vexation
at
the
book
incident
shergold
seemed
unable
to
fix
his
thoughts
on
anything
he
shuffled
in
his
seat
and
kept
glancing
nervously
towards
the
door
was
delighted
to
hear
it
said
his
friend
a
symptom
of
health
go
everywhere
see
everybody
that
worth
seeing
they
got
you
to
talk
i
believe
has
been
telling
you
i
afraid
i
talked
a
lot
of
rubbish
i
had
shivers
of
shame
all
through
a
sleepless
night
after
it
but
some
one
brought
up
whistler
and
etching
and
so
on
and
i
had
a
few
ideas
of
which
i
wanted
to
relieve
my
mind
and
after
all
there
a
pleasure
in
talking
to
intelligent
people
henry
wilt
was
there
with
his
daughters
clever
girls
by
jove
and
peter
rayne
do
you
know
her
of
her
that
all
splendid
woman
brains
brains
upon
my
soul
i
know
no
such
delight
as
listening
to
a
really
intellectual
woman
when
she
also
beautiful
i
shake
with
delight
and
what
women
one
does
meet
nowadays
of
course
the
world
never
saw
their
like
i
have
my
idea
of
aspasia
but
there
are
lots
of
grander
women
in
london
one
ought
to
live
among
the
rich
what
a
wretched
mistake
when
one
can
help
it
to
herd
with
narrow
foreheads
however
laudable
your
motive
since
i
got
back
among
the
better
people
my
life
has
been
trebled
oh
centupled
in
value
boy
remarked
munden
quietly
i
say
something
to
this
effect
on
a
certain
day
nine
years
ago
talk
of
it
the
other
replied
waving
his
hand
in
agitation
never
look
back
at
that
room
is
stuffy
said
munden
rising
us
go
and
have
lunch
somewhere
we
will
just
a
moment
to
wash
my
hands
i
been
in
the
the
friends
went
downstairs
at
the
foot
they
passed
the
daughter
she
drew
back
but
as
shergold
allowed
his
companion
to
pass
into
the
street
her
voice
made
itself
heard
behind
him
you
want
tea
mr
shergold
munden
turned
sharply
and
looked
at
the
girl
shergold
did
not
look
at
her
but
he
delayed
for
a
moment
and
appeared
to
balance
the
question
then
in
a
friendly
voice
he
said
thank
you
i
may
not
be
back
till
late
in
the
evening
and
he
went
on
hurriedly
little
beggar
that
munden
observed
with
a
glance
at
his
friend
not
a
bad
girl
in
her
way
they
made
me
very
comfortable
all
the
same
i
sha
grieve
when
the
day
of
departure
comes
it
was
not
cheerful
the
of
henry
shergold
at
he
found
himself
launched
upon
the
world
with
a
university
education
incomplete
and
about
forty
pounds
in
his
pocket
a
little
management
a
little
less
of
boyish
pride
and
he
might
have
found
the
means
to
go
forward
to
his
degree
with
pleasant
hopes
in
the
background
but
henry
was
a
radical
a
scorner
of
privilege
a
believer
in
human
perfectibility
he
got
a
place
in
an
office
and
he
began
to
write
poetry
some
of
which
was
published
and
duly
left
unpaid
for
a
year
later
there
came
one
fateful
day
when
he
announced
to
his
friend
harvey
munden
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
his
chosen
bride
was
the
daughter
of
a
journeyman
tailor
a
tall
pale
unhealthy
girl
of
eighteen
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
at
a
tobacconist
shop
where
she
served
he
was
going
to
marry
her
on
principle
principle
informed
with
callow
passion
the
passion
of
a
youth
who
has
lived
demurely
more
among
books
than
men
harvey
munden
flew
into
a
rage
and
called
upon
the
gods
in
protest
but
shergold
was
not
to
be
shaken
the
girl
he
declared
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
during
conversations
across
the
counter
her
happiness
was
in
his
hands
and
he
would
not
betray
it
she
had
excellent
dispositions
he
would
educate
her
the
friends
quarrelled
about
it
and
shergold
led
home
his
bride
with
the
results
which
any
sane
person
could
have
foretold
the
marriage
was
a
hideous
disaster
in
three
years
it
brought
shergold
to
an
attempted
suicide
for
which
he
had
to
appear
at
the
his
relative
the
distinguished
doctor
who
had
hitherto
done
nothing
for
him
now
came
forward
with
counsel
and
assistance
happily
the
only
child
of
the
union
had
died
at
a
few
weeks
old
and
the
wife
though
making
noisy
proclamation
of
rights
was
so
weary
of
her
husband
that
she
consented
to
a
separation
but
in
less
than
a
year
the
two
were
living
together
again
shergold
had
been
led
by
her
relatives
to
believe
that
some
day
the
poor
fellow
would
have
his
uncle
money
and
her
wiles
ultimately
overcame
resistance
he
now
studying
law
at
the
doctor
expense
found
himself
once
more
abandoned
and
reduced
to
get
his
living
as
a
solicitor
clerk
his
uncle
had
bidden
him
on
a
postcard
whereon
was
illegibly
scribbled
something
about
fools
he
bore
the
burden
for
three
more
years
then
his
wife
died
one
night
after
screaming
herself
speechless
in
fury
at
shergold
refusal
to
go
with
her
to
a
she
had
a
fit
on
the
stairs
and
in
falling
received
fatal
injuries
the
man
was
free
but
terribly
shattered
only
after
a
long
sojourn
abroad
at
his
kinsman
expense
did
he
begin
to
recover
health
he
came
back
and
entered
himself
as
a
student
at
guy
greatly
to
satisfaction
his
fees
were
paid
and
a
small
sum
was
allowed
him
to
live
upon
a
very
small
sum
by
degrees
some
old
acquaintances
began
to
see
him
but
it
was
only
quite
of
late
that
he
had
accepted
invitations
from
people
of
social
standing
whom
he
met
at
the
doctor
house
the
hints
of
his
story
that
got
about
made
him
an
interesting
figure
especially
to
women
and
his
remarkable
gifts
were
recognised
as
soon
as
circumstances
began
to
give
him
fair
play
all
modern
things
were
of
interest
to
him
and
his
knowledge
acquired
with
astonishing
facility
formed
the
fund
of
talk
which
had
singular
charm
alike
for
those
who
did
and
those
who
did
not
understand
it
undeniably
shy
he
yet
when
warmed
to
a
subject
spoke
with
nerve
and
confidence
in
days
of
jabber
more
or
less
impolite
this
appearance
of
an
articulate
mortal
with
soft
manners
and
totally
unaffected
could
not
but
excite
curiosity
lady
teasdale
eager
for
the
uncommon
chanced
to
observe
him
one
evening
as
he
conversed
with
his
neighbour
at
the
later
in
the
she
encouraged
him
with
flattery
of
rapt
attention
to
a
display
of
his
powers
she
resolved
to
make
him
a
feature
of
her
evenings
fortunately
his
kindred
with
shergold
made
a
respectable
introduction
and
lady
teasdale
whispered
it
among
matrons
that
he
would
inherit
from
the
wealthy
doctor
who
had
neither
wife
nor
child
he
might
not
be
fair
to
look
upon
but
handsome
is
that
handsome
has
and
now
the
doctor
lay
sick
unto
death
society
was
out
of
town
but
lady
teasdale
with
a
house
full
of
friends
about
her
down
in
hampshire
did
not
forget
her
she
waited
with
pleasant
expectation
for
the
young
man
release
from
poverty
it
came
in
a
day
or
two
shergold
was
dead
and
an
enterprising
newspaper
announced
simultaneously
that
the
bulk
of
his
estate
would
pass
to
henry
shergold
a
gentleman
at
present
studying
for
his
profession
this
paragraph
caught
the
eye
of
harvey
munden
who
sent
a
line
to
his
friend
to
ask
if
it
was
true
in
reply
he
received
a
mere
postcard
will
see
you
before
long
but
harvey
wanted
to
be
off
to
como
and
as
business
took
him
into
the
city
he
crossed
the
river
and
sought
maze
pond
again
the
door
was
opened
to
him
by
the
landlady
daughter
she
stood
looking
keenly
in
his
face
her
eyes
smiling
and
yet
suspicious
shergold
in
he
asked
carelessly
he
is
there
was
a
strange
bluntness
about
this
answer
the
girl
stood
forward
as
if
to
bar
the
entrance
and
kept
searching
his
face
is
he
likely
to
be
do
know
he
did
say
when
he
went
out
a
woman
figure
appeared
in
the
background
the
girl
turned
and
said
sharply
right
mother
it
only
somebody
for
mr
shergold
go
upstairs
and
write
a
note
said
munden
in
a
rather
peremptory
voice
the
other
drew
back
and
allowed
him
to
pass
but
with
evident
disinclination
as
he
entered
the
room
he
saw
that
she
had
followed
he
went
up
to
a
on
which
lay
a
with
other
requisites
for
writing
and
then
he
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
in
meditation
name
is
emma
is
it
he
inquired
looking
at
the
girl
with
a
smile
it
is
then
emma
shut
the
door
and
let
have
a
talk
your
mother
mind
will
she
he
added
slyly
the
girl
tossed
her
head
do
see
what
it
got
to
do
with
mother
she
closed
the
door
but
did
not
latch
it
do
you
want
to
talk
about
a
very
nice
girl
to
look
at
emma
and
i
always
admired
you
when
you
opened
the
door
to
me
i
always
liked
your
nice
respectful
way
of
speaking
but
somehow
you
do
speak
quite
so
nicely
what
has
put
you
out
her
eyes
did
not
quit
his
face
for
a
moment
her
attitude
betokened
the
utmost
keenness
of
suspicious
observation
put
me
out
that
i
know
of
you
do
speak
very
nicely
not
very
respectfully
perhaps
he
paused
shergold
is
going
to
leave
he
may
be
you
vexed
at
losing
a
lodger
he
saw
her
lip
curl
and
then
she
laughed
wrong
there
is
it
he
drew
near
and
made
as
though
he
would
advance
a
familiar
arm
emma
started
back
right
she
exclaimed
with
an
insolent
nod
tell
mr
shergold
shergold
why
what
has
it
to
do
with
him
good
deal
for
shame
emma
i
never
expected
do
you
mean
she
retorted
hotly
keep
your
impudence
to
yourself
if
you
want
to
know
shergold
is
going
to
me
so
there
the
stroke
was
effectual
harvey
munden
stood
as
if
transfixed
but
he
recovered
himself
before
a
word
escaped
his
lips
that
alters
the
case
i
beg
your
pardon
you
wo
make
trouble
between
old
friends
vanity
disarmed
the
girl
misgiving
she
grinned
with
satisfaction
depends
how
you
behave
you
do
know
me
but
promise
now
not
a
word
to
shergold
she
gave
a
conditional
promise
and
stood
radiant
with
her
triumph
that
very
good
of
you
well
i
wo
trouble
to
leave
a
note
you
shall
just
tell
shergold
that
i
am
leaving
england
for
a
holiday
i
should
to
see
him
of
course
and
i
may
possibly
look
round
this
evening
if
i
ca
manage
it
just
tell
him
that
i
think
he
ought
to
have
given
me
a
chance
of
congratulating
him
may
i
ask
when
it
is
to
be
emma
resumed
an
air
of
prudery
very
long
i
dessay
wish
you
joy
well
i
must
talk
longer
now
but
i
do
my
best
to
look
in
this
evening
and
then
we
can
all
chat
together
he
laughed
and
she
laughed
back
and
thereupon
they
parted
a
little
after
nine
that
evening
when
only
a
grey
reflex
of
daylight
lingered
upon
a
cloudy
sky
munden
stood
beneath
the
by
hospital
waiting
he
had
walked
the
length
of
maze
pond
and
had
ascertained
that
his
friend
window
as
yet
showed
no
light
shergold
was
probably
still
from
home
in
the
afternoon
he
had
made
inquiry
at
the
house
of
the
deceased
doctor
but
of
henry
nothing
was
known
there
he
left
a
message
for
delivery
if
possible
to
the
effect
that
he
would
call
in
at
maze
pond
between
nine
and
ten
at
a
quarter
past
the
hour
there
appeared
from
the
direction
of
london
bridge
a
figure
walking
slowly
head
bent
munden
moved
forward
and
on
seeing
him
shergold
grasped
his
hand
feverishly
how
glad
i
am
to
meet
you
munden
come
let
us
walk
this
way
he
turned
from
maze
pond
got
your
message
up
yonder
an
hour
or
two
ago
so
glad
i
have
met
you
here
old
fellow
your
day
has
come
said
harvey
trying
to
read
his
features
in
the
gloom
has
left
me
about
eighty
thousand
pounds
shergold
replied
in
a
low
shaken
voice
told
there
are
big
legacies
to
hospitals
as
well
heavens
how
rich
he
was
is
the
funeral
shall
you
live
in
the
meantime
do
know
i
have
thought
about
it
should
go
to
some
hotel
if
i
were
you
said
munden
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
if
i
wait
till
saturday
will
you
come
with
me
to
como
shergold
did
not
at
once
reply
he
was
walking
hurriedly
and
making
rather
strange
movements
with
his
head
and
arms
they
came
into
the
shadow
of
the
vaulted
way
beneath
london
bridge
station
at
this
hour
the
great
tunnel
was
quiet
save
when
a
train
roared
above
the
warehouses
were
closed
one
or
two
idlers
of
forbidding
aspect
hung
about
in
the
murky
gaslight
and
from
the
far
end
came
a
sound
of
children
at
play
wo
be
wanted
here
munden
added
no
i
think
not
there
was
agitation
in
the
voice
you
will
come
i
will
come
shergold
spoke
with
unnecessary
vehemence
and
laughed
oddly
the
matter
with
you
his
friend
asked
the
change
of
circumstances
i
suppose
let
get
on
let
us
go
somewhere
i
ca
help
reproaching
myself
i
ought
to
feel
or
show
a
decent
sobriety
but
what
was
the
old
fellow
to
me
i
grateful
to
him
nothing
else
on
your
mind
shergold
looked
up
startled
do
you
mean
why
do
you
ask
they
stood
together
in
the
black
shadow
of
an
interval
between
two
lamps
after
reflecting
for
a
moment
munden
decided
to
speak
called
at
your
lodgings
early
and
somehow
i
got
into
talk
with
the
girl
she
was
cheeky
and
her
behaviour
puzzled
me
finally
she
made
an
incredible
announcement
that
you
had
asked
her
to
marry
you
of
course
it
a
lie
marry
her
exclaimed
the
listener
hoarsely
with
an
attempt
at
laughter
you
think
that
likely
after
all
i
have
gone
through
i
certainly
do
it
staggered
me
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
can
she
cause
trouble
do
i
know
a
girl
will
lie
so
boldly
she
might
make
a
scandal
i
suppose
or
threaten
it
in
hope
of
getting
money
out
of
me
is
there
any
ground
for
a
scandal
demanded
harvey
the
slightest
as
you
mean
it
glad
to
hear
that
but
she
may
give
you
trouble
i
see
the
thing
does
astonish
you
very
much
no
doubt
you
were
aware
of
her
character
yes
i
know
it
pretty
well
come
let
us
get
out
of
this
squalid
inferno
how
i
hate
it
have
you
had
dinner
i
do
want
any
let
us
go
to
your
rooms
shall
we
there
be
a
hansom
passing
the
bridge
they
walked
on
in
silence
and
when
they
had
found
a
cab
they
drove
westward
talking
only
of
shergold
affairs
munden
lived
in
the
region
of
the
squares
hard
by
the
british
museum
he
took
his
friend
into
a
comfortably
furnished
room
the
walls
hidden
with
books
and
prints
and
there
they
sat
down
to
smoke
a
bottle
of
whisky
within
easy
reach
of
both
it
was
plain
to
harvey
that
some
mystery
lay
in
his
friend
reserve
on
the
subject
of
the
girl
emma
he
was
still
anxious
but
would
not
lead
the
talk
to
unpleasant
things
shergold
drank
like
a
thirsty
man
and
the
whisky
seemed
to
make
him
silent
presently
he
fell
into
absolute
muteness
and
lay
wearily
back
in
his
chair
excitement
has
been
too
much
for
you
munden
remarked
shergold
looked
at
him
with
a
painful
embarrassment
in
his
features
then
suddenly
he
bent
forward
it
i
who
have
lied
i
ask
that
girl
to
marry
me
night
for
a
moment
i
was
insane
they
stared
at
each
other
she
any
hold
upon
you
munden
asked
slowly
whatever
except
this
frantic
offer
of
mine
which
she
inveigled
you
ca
honestly
say
she
did
it
was
entirely
my
own
fault
she
has
never
behaved
loosely
or
even
like
a
schemer
i
doubt
whether
she
knew
anything
about
my
uncle
until
i
told
her
last
night
he
spoke
rapidly
in
a
thick
voice
moving
his
arms
in
helpless
protestation
his
look
was
one
of
unutterable
misery
observed
munden
frenzy
has
at
all
events
passed
you
have
the
to
treat
it
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
really
i
am
tempted
to
believe
that
it
was
literal
lunacy
last
night
were
you
drunk
had
drunk
nothing
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
i
am
a
fool
about
women
i
do
know
what
it
is
certainly
not
a
sensual
or
passionate
nature
mine
is
nothing
of
the
sort
it
sheer
sentimentality
i
suppose
i
ca
be
friendly
with
a
woman
without
drifting
into
mawkish
tenderness
there
the
simple
truth
if
i
had
married
happily
i
think
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
go
about
philandering
the
society
of
a
wife
i
loved
and
respected
would
be
sufficient
but
there
that
need
in
me
the
incessant
hunger
for
a
woman
sympathy
and
affection
such
a
hideous
mistake
as
mine
when
i
married
would
have
made
a
cynic
of
most
men
upon
me
the
lesson
has
been
utterly
thrown
away
i
mean
that
though
i
can
talk
of
women
rationally
enough
with
a
friend
i
am
at
their
mercy
when
alone
with
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
silliest
vulgarest
creature
after
all
is
it
very
much
the
same
with
men
in
general
the
average
man
how
does
he
come
to
marry
do
you
think
he
deliberately
selects
does
he
fall
in
love
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
phrase
with
that
one
particular
girl
no
it
comes
about
by
chance
by
the
drifting
force
of
circumstances
not
one
man
in
ten
thousand
when
he
thinks
of
marriage
waits
for
the
ideal
wife
for
the
woman
who
makes
capture
of
his
soul
or
even
of
his
senses
men
marry
without
passion
most
of
us
have
a
very
small
circle
for
choice
the
hazard
of
everyday
life
throws
us
into
contact
with
this
girl
or
that
and
presently
we
begin
to
feel
either
that
we
have
compromised
ourselves
or
that
we
might
as
well
save
trouble
and
settle
down
as
soon
as
possible
and
the
girl
at
hand
will
do
as
well
as
another
more
often
than
not
it
is
the
girl
who
decides
for
us
in
more
than
half
the
marriages
it
the
woman
who
has
practically
proposed
she
puts
herself
in
a
man
way
with
her
it
rests
almost
entirely
whether
a
man
shall
think
of
her
as
a
possible
wife
or
not
she
has
endless
ways
of
putting
herself
forward
without
seeming
to
do
so
as
often
as
not
it
mere
passivity
that
effects
the
end
she
has
only
to
remain
seated
instead
of
moving
away
to
listen
with
a
smile
instead
of
looking
bored
to
be
at
home
instead
of
being
out
and
she
is
making
love
to
a
man
in
a
palace
of
truth
how
many
husbands
would
have
to
confess
that
it
decidedly
surprised
them
when
they
found
themselves
engaged
to
be
married
the
will
comes
into
play
only
for
a
moment
or
two
now
and
then
of
course
it
is
made
to
seem
responsible
and
in
a
sense
it
responsible
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
purely
as
an
animal
instinct
confirming
the
suggestion
of
circumstances
something
in
all
this
granted
the
listener
it
explain
the
behaviour
of
a
man
who
after
frightful
experience
in
marriage
after
recovering
his
freedom
after
finding
himself
welcomed
by
congenial
society
after
inheriting
a
fortune
to
use
as
he
likes
goes
and
offers
himself
to
an
artful
hussy
in
a
the
special
case
look
how
it
came
to
pass
months
ago
i
knew
i
was
drifting
into
dangerous
relations
with
that
girl
unfortunately
i
am
not
a
rascal
i
ca
think
of
girls
as
playthings
a
fatal
conscientiousness
in
an
unmarried
man
of
no
means
day
after
day
we
grew
more
familiar
she
used
to
come
up
and
ask
me
if
i
wanted
anything
and
of
course
i
knew
that
she
began
to
come
more
often
than
necessary
when
she
laid
a
meal
for
me
we
talked
half
an
hour
at
a
time
the
mother
doubtless
looked
on
with
approval
emma
had
to
find
a
husband
and
why
not
me
as
well
as
another
they
knew
i
was
a
soft
creature
that
i
never
made
a
row
about
anything
was
grateful
for
anything
that
looked
like
kindness
and
so
on
just
the
kind
of
man
to
be
captured
but
no
i
do
want
to
make
out
that
i
am
their
victim
that
a
feeble
excuse
and
a
worthless
one
the
average
man
would
either
have
treated
the
girl
as
a
servant
and
so
kept
her
at
her
distance
or
else
he
would
have
alarmed
her
by
behaviour
which
suggested
anything
you
like
but
marriage
as
for
me
i
had
the
to
take
either
of
these
courses
i
made
a
friend
of
the
girl
talked
to
her
more
and
more
confidentially
and
at
last
fatal
moment
told
her
my
history
yes
i
was
ass
enough
to
tell
that
girl
the
whole
story
of
my
life
can
you
conceive
such
folly
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
understand
we
were
alone
in
the
house
one
evening
after
trying
to
work
for
about
an
hour
i
gave
it
up
i
knew
that
the
mother
was
out
and
i
heard
emma
moving
downstairs
i
was
lonely
and
dispirited
wanted
to
talk
to
talk
about
myself
to
some
one
who
would
give
a
kind
ear
so
i
went
down
and
made
some
excuse
for
beginning
a
conversation
in
the
parlour
it
lasted
a
couple
of
hours
we
were
still
talking
when
the
mother
came
back
i
did
persuade
myself
that
i
cared
for
emma
even
then
her
vulgarisms
of
speech
and
feeling
jarred
upon
me
but
she
was
feminine
she
spoke
and
looked
gently
with
sympathy
i
enjoyed
that
evening
and
you
must
bear
in
mind
what
i
have
told
you
before
that
i
stand
in
awe
of
refined
women
i
am
their
equal
i
know
i
can
talk
with
them
their
society
is
an
exquisite
delight
to
me
but
when
it
comes
to
thinking
of
intimacy
with
one
of
them
perhaps
it
is
my
long
years
of
squalid
existence
perhaps
i
have
come
to
regard
myself
as
doomed
to
life
on
a
lower
level
i
find
it
an
impossible
thing
to
imagine
myself
offering
marriage
making
love
to
a
girl
such
as
those
i
meet
in
the
big
houses
will
outgrow
that
said
munden
yes
i
hope
and
believe
so
and
would
it
be
criminal
to
deny
myself
even
the
chance
now
that
i
have
money
all
i
have
been
tortured
like
a
soul
that
beholds
its
salvation
lost
by
a
moment
weakness
of
the
flesh
you
can
imagine
what
my
suffering
has
been
it
drove
me
into
sheer
lying
i
had
resolved
to
deny
utterly
that
i
had
asked
emma
to
marry
me
to
deny
it
with
a
savage
boldness
and
take
the
consequences
most
rational
resolve
my
dear
fellow
pray
stick
to
it
but
you
told
me
yet
how
the
dizzy
culmination
of
your
madness
was
reached
you
say
that
you
proposed
and
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
emma
when
she
had
accepted
me
that
i
had
eighty
thousand
pounds
you
ca
understand
that
i
suppose
the
change
of
fortune
has
made
me
a
little
i
have
been
going
about
with
a
sense
of
exaltation
which
has
prompted
me
to
endless
follies
i
have
felt
a
desire
to
be
kind
to
people
to
bestow
happiness
to
share
my
joy
with
others
if
i
had
some
of
the
doctor
money
in
my
pocket
i
should
have
given
away
notes
contented
yourself
said
munden
laughing
giving
a
for
the
whole
legacy
but
try
to
understand
emma
came
up
to
my
room
at
and
as
usual
we
talked
i
did
say
anything
about
my
uncle
death
yet
i
felt
the
necessity
of
telling
her
creep
fatally
upon
me
there
was
a
conflict
in
my
mind
between
and
that
awful
sentimentality
which
is
my
curse
when
emma
came
up
again
after
supper
she
mentioned
that
her
mother
was
gone
with
a
friend
to
a
theatre
why
do
you
go
i
said
oh
i
do
go
anywhere
but
after
all
i
urged
consolingly
august
exactly
the
time
for
enjoying
the
theatre
she
admitted
it
was
but
there
was
the
exhibition
at
earl
court
she
had
heard
so
much
of
it
and
wanted
to
go
then
suppose
we
go
together
one
of
these
evenings
see
idiot
and
i
could
help
it
my
tongue
spoke
these
imbecile
words
in
spite
of
my
brain
all
very
well
if
i
had
meant
what
another
man
would
but
i
did
and
the
girl
knew
i
did
and
she
looked
at
me
and
then
why
mere
brute
instinct
did
the
rest
no
not
mere
instinct
for
it
was
complicated
with
that
idiot
desire
to
see
how
the
girl
would
look
hear
what
she
would
say
when
she
knew
that
i
had
given
her
eighty
thousand
pounds
you
ca
understand
a
bit
of
morbid
psychology
yes
the
frantic
proceeding
made
me
happy
for
an
hour
or
two
i
behaved
as
if
i
loved
the
girl
with
all
my
soul
and
afterwards
i
was
still
happy
i
walked
up
and
down
my
bedroom
making
plans
for
the
future
for
her
education
and
so
on
i
saw
all
sorts
of
admirable
womanly
qualities
in
her
i
in
love
with
her
and
there
an
end
of
it
munden
mused
for
a
while
then
laid
down
his
pipe
suggestive
shergold
the
name
of
the
street
in
which
you
have
been
living
well
you
do
go
back
there
i
have
come
to
my
senses
i
shall
go
to
an
hotel
for
and
send
presently
for
all
my
things
be
sure
and
on
saturday
or
on
friday
evening
if
you
like
we
leave
england
it
was
evident
that
shergold
rejoiced
with
trembling
i
ca
stick
to
the
lie
he
said
shall
compensate
the
girl
you
see
by
running
away
i
make
confession
that
there
something
wrong
i
shall
see
a
solicitor
and
put
the
matter
into
his
hands
you
please
but
let
the
solicitor
exercise
his
own
discretion
as
to
damages
shergold
pondered
the
word
suppose
she
wo
drag
me
into
court
make
a
public
ridicule
of
me
if
so
there
an
end
of
my
hopes
i
could
go
among
people
after
that
do
see
why
not
but
your
solicitor
will
probably
manage
the
affair
they
have
their
methods
munden
added
drily
early
the
next
morning
shergold
despatched
a
telegram
to
maze
pond
addressed
to
his
landlady
it
said
that
he
would
be
kept
away
by
business
for
a
day
or
two
on
friday
he
attended
his
uncle
funeral
and
that
evening
he
left
charing
cross
with
harvey
munden
for
como
there
a
fortnight
later
shergold
received
from
his
solicitor
a
communication
which
put
an
end
to
his
feigning
of
repose
and
hopefulness
that
he
did
but
feign
harvey
munden
felt
assured
signs
of
a
troubled
conscience
or
at
all
events
of
restless
nerves
were
evident
in
all
his
doing
and
conversing
now
he
once
more
made
frank
revelation
of
his
weakness
the
devil
to
pay
she
wo
take
money
she
got
a
lawyer
and
is
going
to
bring
me
into
court
i
authorised
reckitt
to
offer
as
much
as
five
thousand
pounds
it
no
good
he
says
her
lawyer
has
evidently
encouraged
her
to
hope
for
enormous
damages
and
then
she
have
the
satisfaction
of
making
me
the
it
all
up
with
me
munden
my
hopes
are
vanished
like
what
is
it
in
dante
fumo
in
aere
ed
in
aqua
la
smoking
a
cavour
munden
lay
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
pergola
and
seemed
to
disdain
reply
advice
the
good
of
advising
a
man
born
to
be
fooled
why
let
the
do
her
worst
shergold
winced
must
forget
that
it
all
my
fault
just
as
it
your
own
fault
you
did
die
on
the
day
of
your
birth
must
raise
the
offer
all
means
offer
ten
thousand
i
suppose
a
jury
would
give
her
two
hundred
and
fifty
the
scandal
the
ridicule
it
very
likely
it
the
only
thing
that
would
teach
you
wisdom
and
save
your
life
one
way
of
looking
at
it
i
half
believe
it
might
be
effectual
he
kept
alone
for
most
of
the
day
in
the
evening
from
nine
to
ten
he
went
upon
the
lake
with
harvey
but
could
not
talk
his
blue
eyes
were
sunk
in
a
restless
melancholy
his
brows
were
furrowed
he
kept
making
short
nervous
movements
as
though
in
silent
remonstrance
with
himself
and
when
the
next
morning
came
and
harvey
munden
rang
the
bell
for
his
coffee
a
waiter
brought
him
a
note
addressed
in
shergold
hand
have
started
for
london
ran
the
hurriedly
written
lines
be
uneasy
all
i
mean
to
do
is
to
stop
the
danger
of
a
degrading
publicity
the
fear
of
is
too
much
for
me
i
have
an
idea
and
you
shall
hear
how
i
get
on
in
a
few
days
the
nature
of
that
promising
idea
munden
never
learnt
his
next
letter
from
shergold
came
in
about
ten
days
it
informed
him
very
briefly
that
the
writer
was
to
be
married
and
that
in
less
than
a
week
he
would
have
started
with
his
wife
on
a
voyage
round
the
world
harvey
did
not
reply
indeed
the
letter
contained
no
address
one
day
in
november
he
was
accosted
at
the
club
by
his
familiar
bore
your
friend
shergold
is
dead
i
know
nothing
of
it
they
talked
of
it
last
night
at
lady
teasdale
he
died
a
few
days
ago
at
calcutta
dysentery
or
something
of
that
kind
his
wife
cabled
to
some
one
or
other
the
salt
of
the
earth
strong
and
silent
the
tide
of
thames
flowed
upward
and
over
it
swept
the
morning
tide
of
humanity
through
white
autumnal
mist
yellow
sunbeams
flitted
from
shore
to
shore
the
dome
the
spires
the
river
frontages
slowly
unveiled
and
brightened
there
was
hope
of
a
fair
day
not
that
it
much
concerned
this
throng
of
men
and
women
hastening
to
their
labour
from
near
and
far
by
the
highways
of
south
london
hither
they
converged
each
morning
and
joined
the
procession
across
the
bridge
their
task
was
the
same
as
yesterday
regardless
of
gleam
or
gloom
many
had
walked
such
a
distance
that
they
plodded
wearily
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
the
more
vigorous
strode
briskly
on
elbowing
their
way
or
nimbly
skipping
into
the
road
to
gain
advance
yet
these
also
had
a
fixed
gaze
preoccupied
or
vacant
seldom
cheerful
here
and
there
a
couple
of
friends
conversed
girls
with
bag
or
parcel
and
a
book
for
the
dinner
hour
chattered
and
laughed
but
for
the
most
part
lips
were
mute
amid
the
clang
and
roar
of
wheels
it
was
the
march
of
those
who
combat
hunger
with
delicate
hands
at
the
pen
point
or
from
behind
the
breastwork
of
a
counter
or
trusting
to
bare
wits
pressed
daily
on
the
grindstone
their
chief
advantage
over
the
sinewy
class
beneath
them
lay
in
the
privilege
of
spending
more
than
they
could
afford
on
house
and
clothing
with
rare
exceptions
they
had
no
hope
no
chance
of
reaching
independence
enough
if
they
upheld
the
threadbare
standard
of
respectability
and
bequeathed
it
to
their
children
as
a
solitary
heirloom
the
oldest
looked
the
poorest
and
naturally
so
amid
the
tramp
of
multiplying
feet
their
steps
had
begun
to
lag
when
speed
was
more
than
ever
necessary
they
saw
newcomers
outstrip
them
and
trudged
under
an
increasing
load
no
eye
surveying
this
procession
would
have
paused
for
a
moment
on
thomas
bird
in
costume
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
him
from
hundreds
of
rather
shabby
clerks
who
passed
along
with
their
and
badly
rolled
umbrella
his
gait
was
that
of
a
man
who
takes
no
exercise
beyond
the
daily
walk
to
and
from
his
desk
the
casual
glance
could
see
nothing
in
his
features
but
patient
dullness
tending
to
good
humour
he
might
be
thirty
he
might
be
forty
impossible
to
decide
yet
when
a
ray
of
sunshine
fell
upon
him
and
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
eastward
promise
there
shone
in
his
countenance
something
one
might
vainly
have
sought
through
the
streaming
concourse
of
which
thomas
bird
was
an
unregarded
atom
for
him
it
appeared
the
struggling
sunlight
had
a
message
of
hope
trouble
cleared
from
his
face
he
smiled
unconsciously
and
quickened
his
steps
for
fifteen
years
he
had
walked
to
and
fro
over
blackfriars
bridge
leaving
his
home
in
camberwell
at
eight
and
reaching
it
again
at
seven
fate
made
him
a
commercial
clerk
as
his
father
before
him
he
earned
more
than
enough
for
his
necessities
but
seemed
to
have
reached
the
limit
of
promotion
for
he
had
no
influential
friends
and
he
lacked
the
capacity
to
rise
by
his
own
efforts
there
may
have
been
some
calling
for
which
thomas
was
exactly
suited
but
he
did
not
know
of
it
in
the
office
he
proved
himself
a
trustworthy
machine
with
no
opportunity
of
becoming
anything
else
his
parents
were
dead
his
kindred
scattered
he
lived
as
for
several
years
past
in
lodgings
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
think
of
his
lot
as
mournful
a
man
of
sociable
instincts
he
had
many
acquaintances
some
of
whom
he
cherished
an
extreme
simplicity
marked
his
tastes
and
the
same
characteristic
appeared
in
his
conversation
an
easy
man
to
deceive
easy
to
make
fun
of
yet
impossible
to
dislike
or
despise
unless
by
the
despicable
he
delighted
in
stories
of
adventure
of
bravery
by
flood
or
field
and
might
have
posed
had
he
ever
posed
at
all
as
something
of
an
authority
on
north
pole
expeditions
and
the
geography
of
polynesia
he
received
his
salary
once
a
month
and
was
the
consciousness
of
having
earned
a
certain
number
of
sovereigns
always
set
his
thoughts
on
possible
purchases
and
at
present
he
was
revolving
the
subject
of
his
wardrobe
certainly
it
needed
renewal
but
thomas
could
not
decide
at
which
end
to
begin
head
or
feet
his
position
in
a
leading
house
demanded
a
good
hat
the
bad
weather
called
for
new
boots
living
economically
as
he
did
it
should
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
resolve
the
doubt
by
purchasing
both
articles
but
for
one
reason
and
another
thomas
seldom
had
a
surplus
over
the
expenses
of
his
lodgings
in
practice
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
save
a
sovereign
for
other
needs
when
evening
released
him
he
walked
away
in
a
cheerful
frame
of
mind
grasping
the
money
in
his
trousers
pocket
and
all
but
decided
to
make
some
acquisition
on
the
way
home
near
ludgate
circus
some
one
addressed
him
over
his
shoulder
evening
tom
pleasant
for
the
time
of
year
the
speaker
was
a
man
of
fifty
stout
and
florid
the
latter
peculiarity
especially
marked
in
his
nose
he
looked
like
a
substantial
merchant
and
spoke
with
rather
pompous
geniality
thrusting
his
arm
through
the
clerk
he
walked
with
him
over
blackfriars
bridge
talking
in
the
friendliest
strain
of
things
impersonal
beyond
the
bridge
you
tram
it
he
asked
glancing
upwards
think
so
warbeck
answered
the
other
whose
tone
to
his
acquaintance
was
very
respectful
i
afraid
it
would
make
me
oh
by
the
bye
tom
i
really
ashamed
most
awkward
that
this
kind
of
thing
happens
so
often
but
could
you
do
you
think
no
no
one
sovereign
only
let
me
make
a
note
of
it
by
the
light
of
this
really
the
total
is
getting
quite
considerable
tut
tut
you
shall
have
a
cheque
in
a
day
or
two
oh
it
ca
run
on
any
longer
i
completely
ashamed
of
myself
entirely
temporary
as
i
explained
a
cheque
on
wednesday
at
latest
tom
they
shook
hands
cordially
and
warbeck
went
off
in
a
hansom
thomas
bird
changing
his
mind
about
the
tram
walked
all
the
way
home
and
with
bent
head
one
would
have
thought
that
he
had
just
done
something
discreditable
he
was
wondering
not
for
the
first
time
whether
warbeck
knew
or
suspected
that
her
husband
was
in
debt
to
him
miss
warbeck
alma
warbeck
assuredly
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
the
system
of
casual
loans
dated
from
nearly
twelve
months
ago
and
the
total
was
now
not
much
less
than
thirty
pounds
warbeck
never
failed
to
declare
that
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
but
probably
the
creditor
experienced
more
discomfort
of
that
kind
at
the
first
playful
demand
thomas
felt
a
shock
he
had
known
the
warbecks
since
he
was
a
lad
had
always
respected
them
as
somewhat
his
social
superiors
and
as
time
went
on
had
recognised
that
the
difference
of
position
grew
wider
he
remaining
stationary
while
his
friends
progressed
to
a
larger
way
of
living
but
they
were
he
thought
no
less
kind
to
him
warbeck
invited
him
to
the
house
about
once
a
month
and
alma
alma
talked
with
him
in
such
a
pleasant
homely
way
did
their
expenditure
outrun
their
means
he
would
never
have
supposed
it
but
for
the
city
man
singular
behaviour
about
the
cheque
so
often
promised
he
cared
little
but
with
all
his
heart
he
hoped
warbeck
did
not
know
somewhere
near
camberwell
green
just
as
he
had
resumed
the
debate
about
his
purchases
a
woman
met
him
with
friendly
greeting
her
appearance
was
that
of
a
decent
shopkeeper
wife
so
glad
i
met
you
bird
i
know
you
be
anxious
to
hear
how
our
poor
friend
is
getting
on
she
spoke
of
the
daughter
of
a
decayed
tradesman
a
weak
and
overworked
girl
who
had
lain
for
some
weeks
in
thomas
hospital
pritchard
a
gadabout
infected
with
philanthropy
was
fond
of
discovering
such
cases
and
in
everyday
conversation
made
the
most
of
her
charitable
efforts
allow
her
out
in
another
week
she
pursued
of
course
she
ca
expect
to
be
fit
for
anything
for
a
time
and
i
very
much
doubt
whether
she
ever
get
the
right
use
of
her
limbs
again
but
what
we
have
to
think
of
now
is
to
get
her
some
decent
clothing
the
poor
thing
has
positively
nothing
i
going
to
speak
to
doubleday
and
a
few
other
people
really
bird
if
it
were
that
i
presumed
on
your
good
nature
so
often
lately
she
paused
and
smiled
unctuously
at
him
afraid
i
ca
do
much
faltered
thomas
reddening
at
the
vision
of
a
new
no
of
course
not
i
sure
i
should
never
expect
it
only
that
every
little
little
help
you
know
thomas
thrust
a
hand
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
florin
which
pritchard
pursed
with
effusive
thanks
certain
of
this
good
woman
critics
doubted
her
competence
as
a
trustee
but
thomas
bird
had
no
such
misgiving
he
talked
with
kindly
interest
of
the
unfortunate
girl
and
wished
her
well
in
a
voice
that
carried
conviction
his
lodgings
were
a
pair
of
very
small
mouldy
and
rooms
he
took
them
unwillingly
overcome
by
the
landlady
doleful
story
of
their
long
lodgerless
condition
and
in
the
exercise
of
a
heavenly
forbearance
remained
year
after
year
the
woman
did
not
cheat
him
and
thomas
knew
enough
of
life
to
respect
her
for
this
remarkable
honesty
she
was
simply
an
ailing
lachrymose
slut
incapable
of
effort
her
son
a
lad
who
had
failed
in
several
employments
from
sheer
feebleness
of
mind
and
body
practically
owed
his
subsistence
to
thomas
bird
whose
good
offices
had
at
length
established
the
poor
fellow
at
a
hairdresser
to
sit
frequently
for
an
hour
at
a
time
as
thomas
did
listening
with
attention
to
batty
talk
of
her
own
and
her
son
ailments
was
in
itself
a
marvel
of
charity
this
evening
she
met
him
as
he
entered
and
lighted
him
into
his
room
a
letter
come
for
you
bird
i
put
it
down
somewheres
why
now
where
i
oh
it
is
you
be
glad
to
as
sam
did
his
first
shave
an
his
did
tremble
much
neither
burning
with
desire
to
open
the
letter
which
he
saw
was
from
warbeck
thomas
stood
patiently
until
the
flow
of
words
began
to
gurgle
away
amid
groans
and
pantings
he
cried
gaily
i
promise
sam
a
shilling
when
he
done
his
first
shave
if
i
did
i
ought
to
have
done
and
here
it
is
for
him
then
he
hurried
into
the
bedroom
and
read
his
letter
by
it
was
a
short
scrawl
on
thin
scented
notepaper
would
he
do
warbeck
the
of
looking
in
before
ten
no
explanation
of
this
unusually
worded
request
and
thomas
fell
at
once
into
a
tremor
of
anxiety
with
a
hurried
glance
at
his
watch
he
began
to
make
ready
for
the
visit
struggling
with
drawers
which
would
neither
open
nor
shut
and
driven
to
despair
by
the
damp
condition
of
his
clean
linen
in
this
room
locked
away
from
all
eyes
but
his
own
lay
certain
relics
which
thomas
worshipped
one
was
a
photograph
of
a
girl
of
fifteen
at
that
age
alma
warbeck
promised
little
charm
and
the
photograph
allowed
her
less
but
it
was
then
that
thomas
bird
became
her
bondman
as
he
had
ever
since
remained
there
was
also
a
letter
the
only
one
that
he
had
ever
received
from
her
bird
mamma
says
will
you
buy
her
some
more
of
those
at
the
shop
in
the
city
and
bring
them
on
yours
sincerely
alma
warbeck
written
when
she
was
sixteen
seven
years
ago
moreover
there
was
a
playbill
used
by
alma
on
the
single
occasion
when
he
accompanied
the
family
to
a
theatre
never
had
he
dared
to
breathe
a
syllable
of
what
he
thought
would
misrepresent
him
for
thomas
in
this
matter
had
always
stifled
hope
indeed
hope
would
have
been
irrational
in
the
course
of
her
teens
alma
grew
tall
and
well
proportioned
not
beautiful
of
feature
but
pleasing
not
brilliant
in
personality
but
fairly
intelligent
and
moderately
ambitious
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
dubiously
active
and
must
deem
it
good
fortune
if
she
married
a
man
with
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
but
thomas
bird
had
no
more
than
his
twelve
pounds
a
month
and
did
not
venture
to
call
himself
a
gentleman
in
alma
he
found
the
essentials
of
true
ladyhood
perhaps
with
reason
he
had
never
heard
her
say
an
thing
nor
seen
upon
her
face
a
look
which
pained
his
acute
sensibilities
she
was
unpretentious
of
equal
temper
nothing
of
a
gossip
kindly
disposed
never
for
a
moment
had
he
flattered
himself
that
alma
perceived
his
devotion
or
cared
for
him
otherwise
than
as
for
an
old
friend
but
thought
is
free
and
so
is
love
the
modest
clerk
had
made
this
girl
the
light
of
his
life
and
whether
far
or
near
the
rays
of
that
ideal
would
guide
him
on
his
unworldly
path
new
shaven
and
freshly
clad
he
set
out
for
the
warbecks
house
which
was
in
a
near
part
of
brixton
not
an
imposing
house
by
any
means
but
an
object
of
reverence
to
thomas
bird
a
servant
whom
he
did
not
recognise
servants
came
and
went
at
the
warbecks
admitted
him
to
the
which
was
vacant
there
his
eyes
wandering
about
the
gimcrack
furniture
which
he
never
found
in
the
same
arrangement
at
two
successive
visits
he
waited
till
his
hostess
came
in
warbeck
was
very
stout
very
plain
and
rather
untidy
yet
her
countenance
made
an
impression
not
on
the
whole
disagreeable
with
her
wide
eyes
slightly
parted
lips
her
homely
smile
and
unadorned
speech
she
counteracted
in
some
measure
the
effect
upon
a
critical
observer
of
the
pretentious
ugliness
with
which
she
was
surrounded
thomas
thought
her
a
straightforward
woman
and
perhaps
was
not
misled
by
his
partiality
certainly
the
tone
in
which
she
now
began
and
the
tenor
of
her
remarks
repelled
suspicion
of
duplicity
now
thomas
i
wish
to
have
a
talk
she
had
thus
styled
him
since
he
grew
too
old
to
be
called
tom
that
is
to
say
since
he
was
seventeen
he
was
now
i
going
to
talk
to
you
just
like
the
old
friends
we
are
you
see
no
nonsense
no
beating
about
the
bush
you
rather
have
it
so
would
you
scarce
able
to
articulate
the
visitor
showed
a
cheery
assent
i
was
sure
of
that
now
better
come
to
the
point
at
once
my
daughter
is
well
no
she
is
yet
but
the
fact
is
i
feel
sure
she
very
soon
be
engaged
the
blow
was
softened
by
thomas
relief
at
discovering
that
money
would
not
be
the
subject
of
their
talk
yet
it
fell
upon
him
and
he
winced
expected
it
pursued
the
lady
with
bluff
of
course
you
have
she
said
a
weakness
happily
unshared
by
her
daughter
do
want
it
talked
about
but
i
know
you
can
hold
your
tongue
well
it
young
fisher
of
nokes
fisher
and
we
known
him
long
but
he
took
from
the
first
to
alma
and
i
have
my
reasons
for
believing
that
the
feeling
is
though
i
would
for
the
world
let
alma
hear
me
say
so
young
fisher
thomas
knew
of
him
a
capable
business
man
and
son
of
a
worthy
father
he
kept
his
teeth
close
his
eyes
down
now
pursued
warbeck
becoming
still
more
genial
getting
round
to
the
unpleasant
side
of
the
talk
though
i
do
see
that
it
be
unpleasant
we
old
friends
and
where
the
use
of
being
friendly
if
you
ca
speak
your
mind
when
speak
you
must
it
comes
to
this
i
just
want
to
ask
you
quite
straightforward
not
to
be
offended
or
take
it
ill
if
we
do
ask
you
to
come
here
till
this
business
is
over
and
settled
you
see
the
fact
is
we
told
fisher
he
can
look
in
whenever
he
likes
and
it
might
happen
you
know
that
he
meet
you
here
and
speaking
like
old
friends
i
think
it
better
not
a
fire
burned
in
the
listener
cheeks
a
noise
buzzed
in
his
ears
he
understood
the
motive
of
this
frank
request
humble
as
ever
never
humbler
than
when
beneath
this
roof
he
was
ready
to
avow
himself
inferior
but
with
all
his
heart
he
wished
that
warbeck
had
found
some
other
way
of
holding
him
aloof
from
her
prospective
course
continued
the
woman
stolidly
does
know
i
saying
this
it
just
between
our
two
selves
i
have
even
spoken
of
it
to
warbeck
i
quite
sure
that
you
understand
that
we
obliged
to
make
a
few
changes
in
the
way
we
lived
it
all
very
well
for
you
and
me
to
be
comfortable
together
and
laugh
and
talk
about
all
sorts
of
things
but
with
one
like
alma
in
the
and
the
friends
she
making
and
the
company
that
likely
to
come
here
now
you
see
what
i
mean
you
now
and
you
wo
take
it
the
wrong
way
no
i
was
sure
you
would
there
now
we
shake
over
it
and
be
as
good
friends
as
ever
the
handshaking
was
metaphorical
merely
thomas
smiled
and
was
endeavouring
to
shape
a
sentence
when
he
heard
voices
out
in
the
hall
alma
and
her
father
back
said
warbeck
did
think
they
come
back
so
soon
they
been
with
some
new
friends
of
ours
thomas
jumped
up
ca
i
rather
not
see
them
please
warbeck
can
you
prevent
it
his
voice
startled
her
somewhat
and
she
hesitated
a
gesture
of
entreaty
sent
her
from
the
room
as
the
door
opened
alma
was
heard
laughing
merrily
then
came
silence
in
a
minute
or
two
the
hostess
returned
and
the
visitor
faltering
you
i
quite
understand
quietly
left
the
house
for
three
weeks
he
crossed
and
recrossed
blackfriars
bridge
without
meeting
warbeck
his
look
was
perhaps
graver
his
movements
less
alert
but
he
had
not
noticeably
changed
his
life
kept
its
wonted
tenor
the
gentleman
at
length
came
face
to
face
with
him
on
ludgate
hill
in
the
an
embarrassment
to
both
speedily
recovering
warbeck
pressed
the
clerk
hand
with
fervour
and
drew
him
aside
been
wanting
to
see
you
tom
so
you
keep
away
from
us
do
you
i
understand
the
old
lady
has
given
me
a
quiet
hint
well
well
quite
right
and
i
honour
you
for
it
tom
nothing
selfish
about
you
keep
it
all
to
yourself
i
honour
you
for
it
my
dear
boy
and
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
you
alma
is
to
be
married
in
january
after
that
same
as
before
wo
it
be
have
a
glass
of
wine
with
me
no
time
we
must
have
a
quiet
dinner
together
some
evening
one
of
the
old
chop
there
was
something
else
i
wanted
to
speak
about
but
i
see
you
in
a
hurry
all
right
it
do
next
time
he
waved
his
hand
and
was
gone
when
next
they
encountered
warbeck
made
bold
to
borrow
ten
shillings
without
the
most
distant
allusion
to
his
outstanding
debt
thomas
bird
found
comfort
in
the
assurance
that
warbeck
had
kept
secret
as
the
borrower
kept
alma
father
was
not
utterly
dishonoured
in
his
sight
one
day
in
january
thomas
pleading
indisposition
left
work
at
twelve
he
had
a
cold
and
a
headache
and
felt
more
miserable
than
at
any
time
since
his
as
he
rode
home
in
an
omnibus
and
warbeck
were
entertaining
friends
at
the
and
thomas
knew
it
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
he
sat
patiently
under
his
landlady
talk
but
a
fit
of
nervous
exasperation
at
length
drove
him
forth
and
he
did
not
return
till
just
as
he
sat
down
to
a
basin
of
gruel
batty
admitted
a
boy
who
brought
him
a
message
sent
me
round
bird
said
the
messenger
she
wants
to
know
if
you
could
just
come
and
see
her
it
something
about
father
he
had
some
work
to
do
but
he
has
come
home
to
do
it
without
speaking
thomas
equipped
himself
and
walked
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
lodgings
of
a
married
friend
of
his
a
clerk
chronically
out
of
work
and
too
often
in
liquor
the
wife
received
him
with
tears
after
eight
weeks
without
earning
a
penny
her
husband
had
obtained
the
job
of
addressing
five
hundred
envelopes
to
be
done
at
home
and
speedily
tempted
forth
by
an
acquaintance
half
a
minute
as
he
sat
down
to
the
task
he
had
been
absent
for
three
hours
and
would
certainly
return
unfit
for
work
is
only
the
money
sobbed
his
wife
it
might
have
got
him
more
work
and
now
of
course
he
lost
the
chance
and
we
have
nothing
more
than
a
crust
of
bread
left
and
thomas
slipped
into
her
hand
and
whispered
jack
before
the
shops
close
then
to
escape
thanks
he
shouted
out
these
blessed
envelopes
and
where
the
addresses
all
right
just
leave
me
this
corner
of
the
table
and
do
speak
to
me
as
long
as
i
sit
here
between
nine
and
twelve
at
the
rate
of
eighty
an
hour
he
addressed
all
but
half
the
five
hundred
envelopes
then
his
friend
appeared
dolefully
drunk
thomas
would
not
look
at
him
finish
the
rest
by
dinner
said
the
miserable
wife
that
in
time
so
thomas
bird
went
home
he
felt
better
at
heart
and
blamed
himself
for
his
weakness
during
the
day
he
blamed
himself
often
enough
for
this
or
that
knowing
not
that
such
as
he
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
the
pig
and
whistle
possess
a
capital
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
of
this
is
invested
in
railway
shares
which
bear
interest
at
three
and
a
half
per
cent
another
third
is
in
government
stock
and
produces
two
and
per
cent
the
rest
is
lent
on
mortgages
at
three
per
cent
calculate
my
income
for
the
present
year
this
kind
of
problem
was
constantly
being
given
out
by
ruddiman
assistant
master
at
longmeadows
school
ruddiman
who
had
reached
the
age
of
and
who
never
in
his
life
had
possessed
pounds
used
his
arithmetic
lesson
as
an
opportunity
for
flight
of
imagination
when
dictating
a
sum
in
which
he
attributed
to
himself
enormous
wealth
his
eyes
twinkled
his
slender
body
struck
a
dignified
attitude
and
he
smiled
over
the
class
with
a
certain
genial
condescension
when
the
calculation
proposed
did
not
refer
to
personal
income
it
generally
illustrated
the
wealth
of
the
nation
in
which
ruddiman
had
a
proud
delight
he
would
bid
his
youngsters
compute
the
proceeds
of
some
familiar
tax
and
the
vast
sum
it
represented
rolled
from
his
lips
on
a
note
of
extraordinary
satisfaction
as
if
he
gloried
in
this
evidence
of
national
prosperity
his
salary
at
longmeadows
just
sufficed
to
keep
him
decently
clad
and
to
support
him
during
the
holidays
he
had
been
a
master
here
for
seven
years
and
earnestly
hoped
that
his
services
might
be
retained
for
at
least
seven
more
there
was
very
little
chance
of
his
ever
obtaining
a
better
position
and
the
thought
of
being
cast
adrift
of
having
to
betake
himself
to
the
school
agencies
and
enter
upon
new
engagements
gave
ruddiman
a
very
unpleasant
sensation
in
his
time
he
had
gone
through
hardships
such
as
naturally
befall
a
teacher
without
diplomas
and
possessed
of
no
remarkable
gifts
that
he
had
never
broken
down
in
health
was
the
result
of
an
admirable
constitution
and
of
much
native
cheerfulness
only
at
such
an
establishment
as
longmeadows
an
commercial
recommended
to
parents
by
the
healthiness
of
its
rural
situation
could
he
have
hoped
to
hold
his
ground
against
modern
educational
tendencies
which
aim
at
obliterating
ruddiman
and
all
his
kind
every
one
liked
him
impossible
not
to
like
a
man
so
abounding
in
kindliness
and
good
humour
but
his
knowledge
was
anything
but
extensive
and
his
methods
in
instruction
had
a
fine
flavour
of
antiquity
now
and
then
ruddiman
asked
himself
what
was
to
become
of
him
when
sickness
or
old
age
forbade
his
earning
even
the
modest
income
upon
which
he
could
at
present
count
but
his
happy
temper
dismissed
the
troublesome
reflection
one
thing
however
he
had
decided
in
future
he
would
find
some
more
economical
way
of
spending
his
holidays
hitherto
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
extravagance
of
taking
long
journeys
to
see
members
of
his
scattered
family
or
of
going
to
the
seaside
or
of
amusing
himself
oh
how
innocently
in
london
this
kind
of
thing
must
really
stop
in
the
coming
summer
vacation
he
had
determined
to
save
at
least
five
sovereigns
and
he
fancied
he
had
discovered
a
simple
way
of
doing
it
on
pleasant
afternoons
when
he
was
duty
ruddiman
liked
to
have
a
long
ramble
by
himself
about
the
fields
and
lanes
in
solitude
he
was
never
dull
had
you
met
him
during
one
of
these
afternoon
walks
more
likely
than
not
you
would
have
seen
a
gentle
smile
on
his
visage
as
he
walked
with
head
bent
not
that
his
thoughts
were
definitely
of
agreeable
things
consciously
he
thought
perhaps
of
nothing
at
all
but
he
liked
the
sunshine
and
country
quiet
and
the
sense
of
momentary
independence
every
one
would
have
known
him
for
what
he
was
his
dress
his
gait
his
countenance
declared
the
ruddiman
never
carried
a
that
would
have
seemed
to
him
to
be
arrogating
a
social
position
to
which
he
had
no
claim
generally
he
held
his
hands
together
behind
him
if
not
so
one
of
them
would
dip
its
fingers
into
a
waistcoat
pocket
and
the
other
grasp
the
lapel
of
his
coat
if
anything
he
looked
rather
less
than
his
age
a
result
perhaps
of
having
always
lived
with
the
young
his
features
were
agreeably
insignificant
his
body
though
slight
of
build
had
something
of
athletic
outline
due
to
long
practice
at
cricket
football
and
hockey
if
he
had
rather
more
time
than
usual
at
his
disposal
he
walked
as
far
as
the
pig
and
whistle
a
picturesque
little
wayside
inn
which
stood
alone
at
more
than
a
mile
from
the
nearest
village
to
reach
the
pig
and
whistle
one
climbed
a
long
slow
ascent
and
in
warm
weather
few
pedestrians
or
for
the
matter
of
that
folks
driving
or
riding
could
resist
the
suggestion
of
the
porch
which
admitted
to
the
quaint
parlour
so
long
was
it
since
the
swinging
sign
had
been
painted
that
neither
of
pig
nor
of
whistle
was
any
trace
now
discoverable
but
over
the
porch
one
read
clearly
enough
the
landlord
name
william
fouracres
only
three
years
ago
had
fouracres
established
himself
here
ruddiman
remembered
his
predecessor
with
whom
he
had
often
chatted
whilst
drinking
his
modest
bottle
of
ginger
beer
the
present
landlord
was
a
very
different
sort
of
man
less
affable
not
disposed
to
show
himself
to
every
comer
customers
were
generally
served
by
the
landlord
daughter
and
with
her
ruddiman
had
come
to
be
on
very
pleasant
terms
but
as
this
remark
may
easily
convey
a
false
impression
it
must
be
added
that
miss
fouracres
was
a
very
discreet
deliberate
person
of
at
least
ruddiman
had
known
her
for
more
than
a
year
before
anything
save
brief
civilities
passed
between
them
in
the
second
twelvemonth
of
their
acquaintance
they
reached
the
point
of
exchanging
reminiscences
as
to
the
weather
discussing
the
agricultural
prospects
of
the
county
and
remarking
on
the
advantage
to
rural
innkeepers
of
the
fashion
of
bicycling
in
the
third
year
they
were
quite
intimate
so
intimate
indeed
that
when
fouracres
chanced
to
be
absent
they
spoke
of
his
remarkable
history
for
the
landlord
of
the
pig
and
whistle
had
a
history
worth
talking
about
and
ruddiman
had
learnt
it
from
the
landlord
own
lips
miss
fouracres
would
never
have
touched
upon
the
subject
with
any
one
in
whom
she
did
not
feel
confidence
to
her
it
was
far
from
agreeable
and
ruddiman
established
himself
in
her
esteem
by
taking
the
same
view
of
the
matter
well
one
july
afternoon
when
the
summer
vacation
drew
near
the
perspired
up
the
sunny
road
with
another
object
than
that
of
refreshing
himself
at
the
familiar
little
inn
he
entered
by
the
ivied
porch
and
within
as
usual
found
miss
fouracres
who
sat
behind
the
bar
sewing
miss
fouracres
wore
a
long
white
apron
which
protected
her
dress
from
neck
to
feet
and
gave
her
an
appearance
of
great
neatness
and
coolness
she
had
a
fresh
complexion
and
features
which
made
no
disagreeable
impression
at
sight
of
the
visitor
she
rose
and
as
her
habit
was
stood
with
one
hand
touching
her
chin
whilst
she
smiled
the
discreetest
of
modest
welcomes
day
miss
fouracres
said
the
after
his
usual
little
cough
day
sir
was
the
reply
in
a
country
voice
which
had
a
peculiar
note
of
honesty
miss
fouracres
had
never
yet
learnt
her
name
weather
for
the
crops
i
take
a
if
you
please
that
it
is
sir
yes
sir
then
followed
two
or
three
minutes
of
silence
miss
fouracres
had
resumed
her
sewing
though
not
her
seat
ruddiman
sipped
his
beverage
more
gravely
than
usual
is
mr
fouracres
he
asked
at
length
sorry
to
say
sir
was
the
subdued
reply
he
thinking
about
the
prince
dear
sighed
ruddiman
as
one
for
whom
this
mysterious
answer
had
distressing
significance
a
great
pity
sir
and
i
sorry
to
say
went
on
miss
fouracres
in
the
same
confidential
tone
the
prince
is
coming
here
i
do
mean
sir
to
the
pig
and
whistle
but
to
woodbury
manor
father
saw
it
in
the
newspaper
and
since
then
he
had
no
rest
day
or
night
he
sitting
out
in
the
garden
i
do
know
whether
you
like
to
go
and
speak
to
him
sir
will
yes
i
certainly
will
but
there
something
i
should
like
to
ask
you
about
first
miss
fouracres
i
thinking
of
staying
in
this
part
of
the
country
through
the
holidays
long
ago
he
had
made
known
his
position
it
has
struck
me
that
perhaps
i
could
lodge
here
could
you
let
me
have
a
room
just
a
bedroom
would
be
enough
yes
sir
replied
the
landlord
daughter
have
two
bedrooms
you
know
and
i
no
doubt
my
father
would
be
willing
to
arrange
with
you
then
i
mention
it
to
him
is
he
in
very
low
spirits
unusual
low
sir
i
should
wonder
if
it
did
him
good
to
see
you
and
talk
a
bit
having
finished
his
ruddiman
walked
through
the
house
and
passed
out
into
the
garden
where
he
at
once
became
aware
of
fouracres
the
landlord
a
man
of
sixty
with
grizzled
hair
and
large
heavy
countenance
sat
in
a
rustic
chair
under
an
beside
him
was
a
little
table
on
which
stood
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
glass
approaching
ruddiman
saw
reason
to
suspect
that
the
landlord
had
partaken
too
freely
of
the
refreshment
ready
to
his
hand
fouracres
person
was
in
a
limp
state
his
cheeks
were
very
highly
coloured
and
his
head
kept
nodding
as
he
muttered
to
himself
at
the
visitor
greeting
he
looked
up
with
a
sudden
surprise
as
though
he
resented
an
intrusion
on
his
privacy
very
hot
fouracres
the
went
on
to
remark
with
cordiality
i
dare
say
it
is
replied
the
landlord
severely
what
else
do
you
expect
at
this
time
of
the
year
sir
so
fouracres
just
so
said
the
other
as
as
possible
do
find
it
unpleasant
should
i
sir
it
was
a
good
deal
hotter
day
than
this
when
his
royal
highness
called
upon
me
a
good
deal
hotter
the
prince
did
complain
not
he
he
said
to
me
i
speaking
of
his
royal
highness
you
understand
i
hope
you
understand
that
sir
perfectly
words
were
very
seasonable
weather
mr
fouracres
i
not
likely
to
forget
what
he
said
so
it
no
use
you
or
any
one
else
trying
to
make
out
that
he
did
say
that
i
tell
you
he
very
season
weather
fouracres
calling
me
by
name
just
like
that
and
it
no
good
you
nor
anybody
else
the
effort
of
repeating
the
prince
utterance
with
what
was
meant
to
be
a
princely
accent
proved
so
exhausting
to
fouracres
that
he
sank
together
in
his
chair
and
lost
all
power
of
coherent
speech
in
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
having
watched
him
a
little
while
ruddiman
spoke
his
name
and
tried
to
attract
his
attention
finding
it
useless
he
went
back
into
the
inn
afraid
i
shall
have
to
put
it
off
to
another
day
was
his
remark
to
the
landlord
daughter
is
rather
drowsy
sir
sighed
the
young
woman
sorry
to
say
he
often
been
like
that
lately
their
eyes
met
but
only
for
an
instant
ruddiman
looked
and
felt
uncomfortable
come
again
very
soon
miss
fouracres
he
said
might
just
speak
to
your
father
about
the
room
you
sir
i
will
sir
and
with
another
uneasy
glance
which
was
not
returned
the
went
his
way
descending
towards
longmeadows
he
thought
over
the
innkeeper
story
which
may
be
briefly
related
some
ten
years
before
this
fouracres
occupied
a
very
comfortable
position
he
was
landlord
of
a
flourishing
inn
called
an
hotel
in
a
little
town
of
some
importance
as
an
agricultural
centre
and
seemed
perfectly
content
with
the
life
and
the
society
natural
to
a
man
so
circumstanced
his
manners
were
marked
by
a
certain
touch
of
pompousness
and
he
liked
to
dwell
upon
the
excellence
of
the
entertainment
which
his
house
afforded
but
these
were
innocent
characteristics
which
did
not
interfere
with
his
reputation
as
a
sensible
and
sound
man
of
business
it
happened
one
day
that
two
gentlemen
on
horseback
evidently
riding
for
their
pleasure
stopped
at
the
inn
door
and
after
a
few
inquiries
announced
that
they
would
alight
and
have
lunch
fouracres
who
himself
received
these
gentlemen
regarded
one
of
them
with
much
curiosity
and
presently
came
to
the
startling
conclusion
that
he
was
about
to
entertain
no
less
a
person
than
the
heir
apparent
he
knew
that
the
prince
was
then
staying
at
a
great
house
some
ten
miles
away
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
one
of
his
guests
had
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
familiar
portraits
of
his
royal
highness
in
his
excitement
at
the
supposed
discovery
fouracres
at
once
communicated
it
to
those
about
him
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
half
the
town
had
heard
the
news
of
course
the
host
would
allow
no
one
but
himself
to
wait
at
the
royal
table
which
was
spread
in
the
inn
best
room
guarded
against
all
intrusion
in
vain
however
did
he
listen
for
a
word
from
either
of
the
gentlemen
which
might
confirm
his
belief
in
their
conversation
no
name
or
title
was
used
and
no
mention
made
of
anything
significant
they
remained
for
an
hour
when
their
horses
were
brought
round
for
them
a
considerable
crowd
had
gathered
before
the
hotel
and
the
visitors
departed
amid
a
demonstration
of
exuberant
loyalty
on
the
following
day
one
or
two
persons
who
had
been
present
at
this
scene
declared
that
the
two
gentlemen
showed
surprise
and
that
though
both
raised
their
hats
in
acknowledgment
of
the
attention
they
received
they
rode
away
laughing
for
the
morrow
brought
doubts
people
began
to
say
that
the
prince
had
never
been
near
the
town
at
all
and
that
evidence
could
be
produced
of
his
having
passed
the
whole
day
at
the
house
where
he
was
a
visitor
fouracres
smiled
disdainfully
no
assertion
or
argument
availed
to
shake
his
proud
assurance
that
he
had
entertained
the
heir
to
the
throne
from
that
day
he
knew
no
peace
fired
with
an
extraordinary
arrogance
he
viewed
as
his
enemy
every
one
who
refused
to
believe
in
the
prince
visit
he
quarrelled
violently
with
many
of
his
best
friends
he
brought
insulting
accusations
against
all
manner
of
persons
before
long
the
man
was
honestly
convinced
that
there
existed
a
conspiracy
to
rob
him
of
a
distinction
that
was
his
due
political
animus
had
perhaps
something
to
do
with
it
for
the
liberal
newspaper
fouracres
was
a
stout
conservative
made
more
than
one
malicious
joke
on
the
subject
a
few
townsmen
stood
by
the
landlord
side
and
used
their
ingenuity
in
discovering
plausible
reasons
why
the
prince
did
not
care
to
have
it
publicly
proclaimed
that
he
had
visited
the
town
and
lunched
at
the
hotel
these
partisans
scorned
the
suggestion
that
fouracres
had
made
a
mistake
but
they
were
unable
to
deny
that
a
letter
addressed
to
the
prince
himself
with
a
view
to
putting
an
end
to
the
debate
had
elicited
in
a
secretarial
hand
a
brief
denial
of
the
landlord
story
evidently
something
very
mysterious
underlay
the
whole
affair
and
there
was
much
shaking
of
heads
for
a
long
time
to
fouracres
the
result
of
the
honour
he
so
strenuously
vindicated
was
serious
indeed
by
way
of
defiance
to
all
mockers
he
wished
to
change
the
sign
of
the
inn
and
to
substitute
for
it
the
prince
of
wales
feathers
on
this
point
he
came
into
conflict
with
the
owner
of
the
property
and
having
behaved
very
violently
received
notice
that
his
lease
just
expiring
would
not
be
renewed
whereupon
what
should
fouracres
do
but
purchase
land
and
begin
to
build
for
himself
an
hotel
twice
as
large
as
that
he
must
shortly
quit
on
this
venture
he
used
all
and
more
than
all
his
means
and
as
every
one
had
prophesied
he
was
soon
a
ruined
man
in
less
than
three
years
from
the
fatal
day
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
town
where
he
had
known
respect
and
prosperity
and
went
forth
to
earn
his
living
as
best
he
could
after
troublous
wanderings
on
which
he
was
accompanied
by
his
daughter
faithful
and
devoted
though
she
had
her
doubts
on
a
certain
subject
the
decayed
publican
at
length
found
a
place
of
rest
a
small
legacy
from
a
relative
had
put
it
in
his
power
to
make
a
new
though
humble
beginning
in
business
he
established
himself
at
the
pig
and
whistle
the
condition
in
which
he
had
been
discovered
by
ruddiman
was
not
habitual
with
him
once
a
month
perhaps
his
melancholy
thoughts
drove
him
to
the
bottle
for
the
most
part
he
led
a
sullen
brooding
life
indifferent
to
the
state
of
his
affairs
and
only
animated
when
he
found
a
new
and
appreciative
listener
to
the
story
of
his
wrongs
that
he
had
been
grievously
wronged
was
fouracres
immutable
conviction
not
by
his
royal
highness
the
prince
knew
nothing
of
the
strange
conspiracy
which
had
resulted
in
fouracres
ruin
letters
addressed
to
his
royal
highness
were
evidently
intercepted
by
underlings
and
never
came
before
the
royal
eyes
again
and
again
had
fouracres
written
long
statements
of
his
case
and
petitioned
for
an
audience
he
was
now
resolved
to
adopt
other
methods
he
would
use
the
first
opportunity
of
approaching
the
prince
person
and
lifting
up
his
voice
where
he
could
not
but
be
heard
he
sought
no
vulgar
gain
his
only
desire
was
to
have
this
fact
recognised
that
he
had
indeed
entertained
the
prince
and
so
put
to
shame
all
his
scornful
enemies
and
now
the
desired
occasion
offered
itself
in
the
month
of
september
his
royal
highness
would
be
a
guest
at
woodbury
manor
distant
only
some
couple
of
miles
from
the
pig
and
whistle
it
was
the
excitement
of
such
a
prospect
which
had
led
fouracres
to
undue
indulgence
under
the
this
afternoon
a
week
later
ruddiman
again
ascended
the
hill
and
after
listening
patiently
to
the
narrative
which
he
had
heard
fifty
times
came
to
an
arrangement
with
fouracres
about
the
room
he
wished
to
rent
for
the
holidays
the
terms
were
very
moderate
and
the
congratulated
himself
on
this
prudent
step
he
felt
sure
that
a
couple
of
months
at
the
pig
and
whistle
would
be
anything
but
disagreeable
the
situation
was
high
and
healthy
the
surroundings
were
picturesque
and
for
society
well
there
was
miss
fouracres
whom
ruddiman
regarded
as
a
very
sensible
and
pleasant
person
of
course
no
one
at
longmeadows
had
an
inkling
of
the
intention
on
the
day
of
up
he
sent
his
luggage
as
usual
to
the
nearest
railway
station
and
that
same
evening
had
it
conveyed
by
carrier
to
the
little
wayside
inn
where
much
at
ease
in
mind
and
body
he
passed
his
first
night
he
had
a
few
books
with
him
but
ruddiman
was
not
much
of
a
reader
in
the
garden
of
the
inn
or
somewhere
near
by
he
found
a
spot
of
shade
and
there
pipe
in
mouth
was
content
to
fleet
the
hours
as
they
did
in
the
golden
age
now
and
then
he
tried
to
awaken
his
host
interest
in
questions
of
national
finance
it
was
one
of
ruddiman
favourite
amusements
to
sketch
budgets
in
anticipation
of
that
to
be
presented
by
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
he
always
convinced
himself
that
his
own
financial
expedients
were
much
superior
to
those
laid
before
parliament
all
sorts
of
ingenious
little
imposts
were
constantly
occurring
to
him
and
his
mouth
watered
with
delight
at
the
sound
of
millions
which
might
thus
be
added
to
the
national
wealth
but
to
fouracres
such
matters
seemed
trivial
a
churchwarden
between
his
lips
he
appeared
to
listen
sometimes
giving
a
nod
or
a
grunt
in
reality
his
thoughts
were
wandering
amid
bygone
glories
or
picturing
a
day
of
brilliant
revenge
much
more
satisfactory
were
the
conversations
between
ruddiman
and
his
host
daughter
they
were
generally
concerned
with
the
budget
not
of
the
nation
but
of
the
pig
and
whistle
miss
fouracres
was
a
woman
of
much
domestic
ability
she
knew
how
to
get
the
maximum
of
comfort
out
of
small
resources
but
for
her
the
inn
would
have
been
a
wretched
little
place
as
indeed
it
was
before
her
time
miss
fouracres
worked
hard
and
prudently
she
had
no
help
the
garden
the
poultry
all
the
cares
of
house
and
inn
were
looked
after
by
her
alone
except
indeed
a
few
tasks
beyond
her
physical
strength
which
were
disdainfully
performed
by
the
landlord
a
pony
and
cart
served
chiefly
to
give
fouracres
an
airing
when
his
life
of
sedentary
dignity
grew
burdensome
one
afternoon
when
he
had
driven
to
the
market
town
his
daughter
and
her
guest
were
in
the
garden
together
gathering
broad
beans
and
gossiping
with
much
contentment
wish
i
could
always
live
here
exclaimed
ruddiman
after
standing
for
a
moment
with
eyes
fixed
meditatively
upon
a
very
large
pod
which
he
had
just
picked
miss
fouracres
looked
at
him
as
if
in
surprise
her
left
hand
clasping
her
chin
you
soon
get
tired
of
it
sir
should
no
i
sure
i
should
i
like
this
life
it
suits
me
i
like
it
a
thousand
times
better
than
teaching
in
a
school
your
fancy
sir
as
miss
fouracres
spoke
a
sound
from
the
house
drew
her
attention
some
one
had
entered
the
inn
customer
said
ruddiman
me
go
and
serve
him
do
let
me
you
would
know
how
sir
it
beer
and
that
most
likely
i
know
well
enough
i
watched
you
so
often
i
go
and
see
with
the
face
of
a
schoolboy
he
ran
into
the
house
and
was
absent
about
ten
minutes
then
he
reappeared
chinking
coppers
in
his
hand
and
laughing
gleefully
cyclist
pint
of
i
served
him
as
if
i
done
nothing
else
all
my
life
miss
fouracres
looked
at
him
with
wonder
and
admiration
she
did
not
laugh
demonstrative
mirth
was
not
one
of
her
characteristics
but
for
a
long
time
there
dwelt
upon
her
good
plain
countenance
a
of
placid
contentment
when
they
went
in
together
ruddiman
begged
her
to
teach
him
all
the
mysteries
of
the
bar
and
his
request
was
willingly
granted
in
this
way
they
amused
themselves
until
the
return
of
the
landlord
who
as
soon
as
he
had
stabled
his
pony
called
ruddiman
aside
and
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
prince
comes
does
he
was
the
answer
in
a
tone
of
feigned
interest
shall
see
him
it
all
settled
i
made
friends
with
one
of
the
gardeners
at
woodbury
manor
and
he
promised
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
meeting
his
royal
highness
i
shall
have
to
go
over
there
for
a
day
or
two
and
stay
in
woodbury
to
be
on
the
spot
when
the
chance
offers
fouracres
had
evidently
been
making
his
compact
with
the
aid
of
strong
liquor
he
walked
unsteadily
and
in
other
ways
betrayed
imperfect
command
of
himself
presently
at
the
he
revealed
to
his
daughter
the
great
opportunity
which
lay
before
him
and
spoke
of
the
absence
from
home
it
would
necessitate
course
you
do
as
you
like
father
replied
miss
fouracres
with
her
usual
deliberation
and
quite
i
think
you
going
on
a
fool
errand
and
that
i
tell
you
plain
if
you
just
forget
all
about
the
prince
and
settle
down
quiet
at
the
pig
and
whistle
it
be
a
good
deal
better
for
you
the
landlord
regarded
her
with
surprise
and
scorn
it
was
the
first
time
that
his
daughter
had
ventured
to
express
herself
so
unmistakably
pig
and
whistle
he
exclaimed
pothouse
i
who
have
kept
an
hotel
and
entertained
his
royal
highness
you
speak
like
an
ignorant
woman
hold
your
tongue
and
do
dare
to
let
me
hear
your
voice
again
until
morning
miss
fouracres
obeyed
him
she
was
absolutely
mute
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
save
when
obliged
to
exchange
a
word
or
two
with
rustic
company
or
in
the
taproom
her
features
expressed
uneasiness
rather
than
mortification
the
next
day
after
an
early
breakfast
fouracres
set
forth
to
the
town
of
woodbury
he
had
the
face
of
a
man
with
a
fixed
idea
and
looked
more
obstinate
more
unintelligent
than
ever
to
his
daughter
he
had
spoken
only
a
few
cold
words
and
his
last
bidding
to
her
was
care
of
the
pothouse
this
treatment
gave
miss
fouracres
much
pain
for
she
was
a
softhearted
woman
and
had
never
been
anything
but
loyal
and
affectionate
to
her
father
all
through
his
disastrous
years
moreover
she
liked
the
pig
and
whistle
and
could
not
bear
to
hear
it
spoken
of
disdainfully
before
the
sound
of
the
cart
had
died
away
she
had
to
wipe
moisture
from
her
eyes
and
at
the
moment
when
she
was
doing
so
ruddiman
came
into
the
parlour
fouracres
gone
asked
the
guest
with
embarrassment
gone
sir
replied
the
young
woman
half
turned
away
and
nervously
fingering
her
chin
should
trouble
about
it
if
i
were
you
miss
fouracres
said
ruddiman
in
a
tone
of
friendly
encouragement
soon
be
back
soon
be
back
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
there
be
no
harm
done
hope
so
sir
but
i
an
uneasy
sort
of
feeling
i
have
indeed
you
worry
miss
fouracres
when
the
prince
has
gone
away
he
be
better
miss
fouracres
stood
for
a
moment
with
eyes
cast
down
then
looking
gravely
at
ruddiman
said
in
a
sorrowful
voice
calls
the
pig
and
whistle
a
pothouse
that
was
wrong
of
him
protested
the
other
no
less
earnestly
pothouse
indeed
why
it
one
of
the
nicest
little
inns
you
could
find
anywhere
i
getting
fond
of
the
pig
and
whistle
a
pothouse
indeed
no
i
call
that
shameful
the
listener
eyes
shone
with
gratification
course
we
got
to
remember
she
said
more
softly
father
has
known
very
different
things
do
care
what
he
has
known
cried
ruddiman
hope
i
may
never
have
a
worse
home
than
the
pig
and
whistle
and
i
only
wish
i
could
live
here
all
the
rest
of
my
life
instead
of
going
back
to
that
beastly
school
you
like
the
school
mr
ruddiman
i
ca
say
i
it
but
since
i
been
living
here
well
it
no
use
thinking
of
impossibilities
towards
midday
the
pony
and
trap
came
back
driven
by
a
lad
from
woodbury
who
had
business
in
this
direction
miss
fouracres
asked
him
to
unharness
and
stable
the
pony
and
whilst
this
was
being
done
ruddiman
stood
by
studiously
observant
he
had
pleasure
in
every
detail
of
the
inn
life
he
several
times
waited
upon
passing
guests
and
laughed
exultantly
at
the
perfection
he
was
attaining
miss
fouracres
seemed
hardly
less
pleased
but
when
alone
she
still
wore
an
anxious
look
and
occasionally
heaved
a
sigh
of
trouble
ruddiman
as
usual
took
an
early
supper
and
soon
after
went
up
to
his
room
by
ten
the
house
was
closed
and
all
through
the
night
no
sound
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
pig
and
whistle
the
morrow
passed
without
news
of
fouracres
on
the
morning
after
just
as
ruddiman
was
finishing
his
breakfast
alone
in
the
parlour
he
heard
a
loud
cry
of
distress
from
the
front
part
of
the
inn
rushing
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
found
miss
fouracres
in
agitated
talk
with
a
man
on
horseback
what
did
i
say
she
cried
at
sight
of
the
guest
i
something
was
going
to
happen
i
must
go
at
once
i
must
put
in
the
pony
do
that
for
you
said
ruddiman
what
has
happened
the
horseman
a
messenger
from
woodbury
told
a
strange
tale
very
early
this
morning
a
gardener
walking
through
the
grounds
at
woodbury
manor
and
passing
by
a
little
lake
or
fishpond
saw
the
body
of
a
man
lying
in
the
water
which
at
this
point
was
not
three
feet
in
depth
he
drew
the
corpse
to
the
bank
and
in
so
doing
recognised
his
acquaintance
fouracres
with
whom
he
had
spent
an
hour
or
two
at
a
in
woodbury
on
the
evening
before
how
the
landlord
of
the
pig
and
whistle
had
come
to
this
tragic
end
neither
the
gardener
nor
any
one
else
in
the
neighbourhood
could
conjecture
ruddiman
set
to
work
at
once
on
harnessing
the
pony
while
miss
fouracres
now
quietly
weeping
went
to
prepare
herself
for
the
journey
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
vehicle
was
ready
at
the
door
the
messenger
had
already
ridden
away
you
drive
yourself
miss
fouracres
asked
ruddiman
looking
and
speaking
with
genuine
sympathy
yes
sir
but
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
the
house
i
may
be
away
all
day
and
what
about
you
sir
me
to
look
after
myself
miss
fouracres
and
trust
me
to
look
after
the
house
too
will
you
you
know
i
can
do
it
will
you
trust
me
only
that
i
ashamed
sir
a
bit
of
it
i
very
glad
indeed
to
be
useful
i
assure
you
i
am
your
dinner
sir
there
cold
meat
do
you
worry
miss
fouracres
i
look
after
myself
and
the
house
too
see
if
i
do
go
at
once
and
keep
your
mind
at
ease
on
my
account
pray
do
very
good
of
you
sir
i
sure
it
is
oh
i
something
was
going
to
happen
did
i
so
ruddiman
helped
her
into
the
trap
they
shook
hands
silently
and
miss
fouracres
drove
away
before
the
turn
of
the
road
she
looked
back
ruddiman
was
still
watching
her
he
waved
his
hand
and
the
young
woman
waved
to
him
in
reply
left
alone
the
took
off
his
coat
and
put
on
an
apron
then
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
washing
up
his
breakfast
things
afterwards
he
put
his
bedroom
in
order
about
ten
the
first
customer
came
in
and
as
luck
had
it
the
day
proved
a
busier
one
than
usual
no
less
than
four
cyclists
stopped
to
make
a
meal
ruddiman
was
able
to
supply
them
with
cold
beef
and
ham
moreover
he
cooked
eggs
he
made
tea
and
all
this
with
a
skill
and
expedition
which
could
hardly
have
been
expected
of
him
none
the
less
did
he
think
constantly
of
miss
fouracres
about
five
in
the
afternoon
wheels
sounded
aproned
and
in
his
he
ran
to
the
door
as
he
had
already
done
several
times
at
the
sound
of
a
vehicle
and
with
great
satisfaction
saw
the
face
of
his
hostess
she
too
though
her
eyes
showed
she
had
been
weeping
long
smiled
with
gladness
the
next
moment
she
exclaimed
distressfully
sir
to
think
you
been
here
alone
all
day
and
in
an
apron
think
about
me
miss
fouracres
you
look
worn
out
and
no
wonder
i
get
you
some
tea
at
once
let
the
pony
stand
here
a
little
he
not
so
tired
as
you
are
come
in
and
have
some
tea
miss
fouracres
ruddiman
would
not
be
denied
he
waited
upon
his
hostess
got
her
a
very
comfortable
tea
and
sat
near
her
whilst
she
was
enjoying
it
miss
fouracres
story
of
the
day
events
still
left
her
father
death
most
mysterious
all
that
could
be
certainly
known
was
that
the
landlord
of
the
pig
and
whistle
had
drunk
rather
freely
with
his
friend
the
gardener
at
an
inn
at
woodbury
and
towards
nine
in
the
evening
had
gone
out
as
he
said
for
a
stroll
before
bedtime
why
he
entered
the
grounds
of
woodbury
manor
and
how
he
got
into
the
pond
there
no
one
could
say
people
talked
of
suicide
but
miss
fouracres
would
not
entertain
that
suggestion
of
course
there
was
to
be
an
inquest
and
one
could
only
await
the
result
of
such
evidence
as
might
be
forthcoming
during
the
day
miss
fouracres
had
telegraphed
to
the
only
relatives
of
whom
she
knew
anything
two
sisters
of
her
father
who
kept
a
shop
in
london
possibly
one
of
them
might
come
to
the
funeral
said
ruddiman
in
a
comforting
tone
you
have
to
do
is
to
keep
quiet
do
trouble
about
anything
i
look
after
the
business
miss
fouracres
smiled
at
him
through
her
tears
very
good
of
you
sir
but
you
make
me
feel
ashamed
what
sort
of
a
day
have
you
had
look
here
he
exhibited
the
day
receipts
a
handful
of
cash
and
with
delight
decently
subdued
gave
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
like
this
business
he
exclaimed
you
trouble
about
anything
leave
it
all
to
me
miss
fouracres
one
of
the
london
aunts
came
down
and
passed
several
days
at
the
pig
and
whistle
she
was
a
dry
keen
elderly
woman
chiefly
interested
in
the
question
of
her
deceased
brother
property
which
proved
to
be
insignificant
enough
meanwhile
the
inquest
was
held
and
all
the
countryside
talked
of
fouracres
whose
story
of
course
was
published
in
full
detail
by
the
newspapers
once
more
opinions
were
divided
as
to
whether
the
hapless
landlord
really
had
or
had
not
entertained
his
royal
highness
plainly
fouracres
presence
in
the
grounds
of
woodbury
manor
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
prince
happened
to
be
staying
there
in
a
state
of
irresponsibility
partly
to
be
explained
by
intoxication
partly
by
the
impulse
of
his
fixed
idea
he
must
have
gone
rambling
in
the
dark
round
the
manor
and
there
by
accident
have
fallen
into
the
water
no
clearer
hypothesis
resulted
from
the
legal
inquiry
and
with
this
all
concerned
had
perforce
to
be
satisfied
fouracres
was
buried
and
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
his
sister
returned
to
london
she
showed
no
interest
whatever
in
her
niece
who
equally
independent
asked
neither
counsel
nor
help
ruddiman
and
his
hostess
were
alone
together
at
the
pig
and
whistle
the
situation
had
a
certain
awkwardness
familiars
of
the
inn
of
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
course
began
to
comment
on
the
state
of
things
joking
among
themselves
about
ruddiman
activity
behind
the
bar
the
himself
was
in
an
uneasy
frame
of
mind
when
miss
fouracres
aunt
had
gone
he
paced
for
an
hour
or
two
about
the
garden
the
hostess
was
serving
cyclists
at
length
the
familiar
voice
called
to
him
you
have
your
dinner
mr
ruddiman
he
went
in
and
before
entering
the
parlour
stood
looking
at
a
cask
of
ale
which
had
been
tilted
forward
must
tap
the
new
cask
he
remarked
sir
i
suppose
we
must
replied
his
hostess
half
absently
do
it
at
once
some
more
cyclists
might
come
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
saw
very
little
of
each
other
ruddiman
rambled
musing
when
he
came
at
the
usual
hour
to
supper
guests
were
occupying
the
hostess
having
eaten
he
went
out
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
garden
and
lingered
there
it
being
a
fine
warm
night
till
after
ten
miss
fouracres
voice
aroused
him
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
just
locked
up
sir
yes
it
late
they
stood
a
few
paces
apart
ruddiman
had
one
hand
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
the
other
behind
his
back
miss
fouracres
was
fingering
her
chin
been
wondering
said
the
in
a
diffident
voice
you
manage
all
alone
miss
fouracres
sir
was
the
equally
diffident
reply
been
wondering
too
wo
be
easy
to
manage
the
pig
and
whistle
all
alone
afraid
not
sir
you
could
live
here
in
absolute
solitude
it
would
be
safe
should
quite
like
it
sir
i
sure
you
would
like
to
leave
the
pig
and
whistle
miss
fouracres
much
rather
stay
sir
if
i
could
any
way
manage
it
ruddiman
drew
a
step
nearer
you
know
miss
fouracres
i
been
thinking
just
the
same
the
fact
is
i
do
like
the
thought
of
leaving
the
pig
and
whistle
i
do
like
it
at
all
this
life
suits
me
could
you
he
gave
a
little
laugh
me
as
your
assistant
miss
fouracres
sir
could
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
sir
then
there
only
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
that
i
can
see
do
you
think
had
it
not
been
dark
ruddiman
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
make
the
suggestion
which
fell
from
him
in
a
whisper
had
it
not
been
dark
miss
fouracres
would
assuredly
have
hesitated
much
longer
before
giving
her
definite
reply
as
it
was
five
minutes
of
conversation
solved
what
had
seemed
a
harder
problem
than
any
the
set
to
his
class
at
longmeadows
and
when
these
two
turned
to
enter
the
pig
and
whistle
they
went
hand
in
hand
