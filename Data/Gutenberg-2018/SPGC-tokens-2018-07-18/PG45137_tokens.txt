preface
the
purpose
of
this
book
is
to
provide
not
only
a
popular
account
of
the
religion
and
mythology
of
ancient
babylonia
and
assyria
but
to
extract
and
present
to
the
reader
the
treasures
of
romance
latent
in
the
subject
the
peculiar
richness
of
which
has
been
recognized
since
the
early
days
of
archæological
effort
in
chaldea
unfortunately
with
few
exceptions
writers
who
have
made
the
field
a
special
study
have
rarely
been
able
to
triumph
over
the
limitations
which
so
often
obtrude
in
works
of
scholarship
and
research
it
is
true
that
the
pages
of
rawlinson
smith
layard
and
sayce
are
enlivened
at
intervals
with
pictures
of
assyrian
splendour
and
babylonian
glory
gleams
which
escape
as
the
curtains
which
veil
the
wondrous
past
are
partially
lifted
but
such
glimpses
are
only
interludes
in
lengthy
disquisitions
which
too
often
must
be
tedious
for
the
general
reader
it
was
such
a
consideration
which
prompted
the
preparation
of
this
volume
might
not
a
book
be
written
which
should
contain
the
pure
gold
of
babylonian
romance
freed
from
the
darker
ore
of
antiquarian
research
so
far
so
good
but
gold
in
the
pure
state
is
notoriously
unserviceable
and
an
alloy
which
renders
it
of
greater
utility
may
detract
nothing
from
its
brilliance
romance
or
no
romance
in
these
days
it
will
not
do
to
furnish
stories
of
the
gods
without
attempting
some
definition
of
their
nature
and
origin
for
more
than
ever
before
romance
and
knowledge
are
a
necessary
blend
in
the
making
of
a
satisfactory
book
on
mythology
nevertheless
it
is
anticipated
that
it
will
be
to
the
modern
reader
who
loves
the
romance
of
antiquity
that
this
book
will
especially
appeal
it
is
claimed
that
the
greater
part
of
chaldean
romance
clusters
around
the
wonderful
mythology
and
religion
of
that
land
it
is
therefore
of
these
departments
of
chaldean
lore
that
this
volume
chiefly
treats
but
the
history
of
babylonia
and
assyria
has
not
been
neglected
the
great
names
in
its
records
will
be
found
to
recur
constantly
in
these
pages
in
most
instances
accompanied
by
a
tale
or
legend
which
will
illuminate
the
circumstances
of
their
careers
and
serve
to
retain
these
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
nor
has
the
biblical
connexion
with
chaldea
been
forgotten
the
reader
will
find
as
he
proceeds
frequent
references
to
the

in

and

to
our
fathers
until
a
century
ago
babylon
was
no
more
than
a
mighty
name
a
gigantic
skeleton
whose
ribs
protruded
here
and
there
from
the
sands
of
syria
in
colossal
ruin
of
tower
and
temple
but
now
the
grey
shroud
which
hid
from
view
the
remains
of
the
glow
and
glitter
of
her
ancient
splendour
has
to
some
extent
been
withdrawn
and
through
the
labours
of
a
band
of
scholars
and
explorers
whose
lives
and
work
must
be
classed
as
among
the
most
romantic
passages
in
the
history
of
human
effort
we
are
now
enabled
to
view
the
wondrous
panorama
of
human
civilization
as
it
evolved
in
the
valleys
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
the
name
carries
with
it
the
sound
of
a
deep
mysterious
spell
such
a
conjuration
as
might
be
uttered
in
the
recesses
of
secret
temples
it
awakens
a
thousand
echoes
in
the
imagination
it
holds
a
music
richer
than
that
of
egypt
babylon
babylon
the
sonorous
charm
of
the
word
is
as
a
line
from
some
great
epic
it
falls
on
the
ear
of
the
historian
like
distant
thunder
behind
the
grandeur
of
rome
and
the
beauty
of
greece
it
looms
as
a
great
and
thick
darkness
over
which
flash
at
intervals
streams
of
uncertain
light
as
kings
and
priests
conquerors
and
tyrants
and
mighty
builders
pass
through
the
gloom
from
obscurity
to
obscurity
sometimes
in
the
full
glare
of
historical
recognition
but
more
often
in
the
and
partially
relieved
dusk
of
uncertainty
other
shapes
again
move
like
ghosts
in
complete
and
utter
darkness
and
these
are
by
far
the
most
numerous
of
all
but
the
spirit
of
babylon
is
no
soft
and
alluring
thing
eloquent
of
oriental
wonders
or
charged
with
the
delicious
fascination
of
the
east
rather
is
it
a
thing
stark
and
strong
informed
with
fate
and
epical
in
its
intense
recognition
of
destiny
in
babylonian
history
there
are
but
two
figures
of
moment
the
soldier
and
the
priest
we
are
dealing
with
a
race
austere
and
stern
a
race
of
rigorous
religious
devotees
and
conquerors
the
romans
of
the
east
but
not
an
unimaginative
race
for
the
babylonians
and
assyrians
came
of
that
stock
which
gave
to
the
world
its
greatest
religions
judaism
christianity
and
mohammedanism
a
race
not
without
the
sense
of
mystery
and
science
for
babylon
was
the
mother
of
astrology
and
magic
and
established
the
beginnings
of
the
study
of
the
stars
and
lastly
of
commerce
for
the
first
true
financial
operations
and
the
first
houses
of
exchange
were
founded
in
the
shadows
of
her
temples
and
palaces
the
boundaries
of
the
land
where
the
races
of
babylonia
and
assyria
evolved
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
original
civilizations
in
the
world
history
are
the
two
mighty
rivers
of
western
asia
the
tigris
and
euphrates
assyria
being
identical
with
the
more
northerly
and
mountainous
portion
and
babylonia
with
the
southerly
part
which
inclined
to
be
flat
and
marshy
both
tracts
of
country
were
inhabited
by
people
of
the
same
race
save
that
the
assyrians
had
acquired
the
characteristics
of
a
population
dwelling
in
a
hilly
country
and
had
become
to
some
extent
intermingled
with
hittite
and
amorite
elements
but
both
were
branches
of
an
ancient
semitic
stock
the
epoch
of
whose
entrance
into
the
land
it
is
impossible
to
fix
in
the
oldest
inscriptions
discovered
we
find
those
semitic
immigrants
at
strife
with
the
indigenous
people
of
the
country
the
akkadians
with
whom
they
were
subsequently
to
mingle
and
whose
beliefs
and
magical
and
occult
conceptions
especially
they
were
afterward
to
incorporate
with
their
own
the
akkadians
who
then
were
the
akkadians
whom
the
babylonian
semites
came
to
displace
but
with
whom
they
finally
mingled
great
and
bitter
has
been
the
controversy
which
has
raged
around
the
racial
affinities
of
this
people
some
have
held
that
they
were
themselves
of
semitic
stock
others
that
they
were
of
a
race
more
nearly
approaching
the
mongol
the
lapp
and
the
basque
in
such
a
book
as
this
the
object
of
which
is
to
present
an
account
of
the
babylonian
mythology
it
is
unnecessary
to
follow
the
protagonists
of
either
theory
into
the
dark
recesses
whither
the
conflict
has
led
them
but
the
probability
is
that
the
akkadians
who
are
usually
represented
upon
their
monuments
as
a
beardless
people
with
oblique
eyes
were
connected
with
that
great
mongolian
family
which
has
thrown
out
tentacles
from
its
original
home
in
central
asia
to
the
frozen
regions
of
the
arctic
the
north
of
europe
the
turkish
empire
aye
and
perhaps
to
america
itself
akkadian
in
its
linguistic
features
and
especially
in
its
grammatical
structure
shows
a
resemblance
to
the
group
of
languages
which
embraces
turkish
and
finnish
and
this
is
in
itself
good
evidence
that
the
people
who
spoke
it
belonged
to
that
ethnic
division
but
the
question
is
a
thorny
one
and
pages
nay
volumes
might
be
occupied
in
presenting
the
arguments
for
and
against
such
a
belief
it
was
from
the
akkadians
however
that
the
babylonian
semites
received
the
germs
of
their
culture
indeed
it
may
be
avowed
that
this
aboriginal
people
carried
them
well
on
the
way
toward
civilization
not
only
did
they
instruct
the
semitic
in
the
arts
of
writing
and
reading
but
they
strongly
biased
their
religious
beliefs
and
so
inspired
them
with
the
idea
of
the
sanctity
of
their
own
faith
that
the
later
babylonian
priesthood
preserved
the
old
akkadian
tongue
among
them
as
a
sacred
language
just
as
the
roman
priesthood
has
retained
the
use
of
the
dead
latin
speech
indeed
the
proper
pronunciation
of
akkadian
was
an
absolute
necessity
to
the
successful
performance
of
religious
ritual
and
it
is
passing
strange
to
observe
that
the
babylonian
priests
composed
new
religious
texts
in
a
species
of
just
as
the
monks
of
the
middle
ages
composed
their
writings
in
with
such
zeal
have
the
religious
in
all
ages
clung
to
the
cult
of
the
ancient
the
mystic
and
thing
unknown
to
the
vulgar
when
we
first
encounter
babylonian
civilization
we
find
it
grouped
round
about
two
nuclei
nippur
in
the
north
and
eridu
in
the
south
the
first
had
grown
up
around
a
sanctuary
of
the
god
who
held
sway
over
the
ghostly
animistic
spirits
which
at
his
bidding
might
pose
as
the
friends
or
enemies
of
men
a
more
deity
held
sway
at
eridu
which
was
the
home
of
ea
or
oannes
the
god
of
light
and
wisdom
who
exercised
his
knowledge
of
the
healing
art
for
the
benefit
of
his
votaries
from
the
waters
of
the
persian
gulf
whence
he
rose
each
morning
he
brought
knowledge
of
all
manner
of
crafts
and
trades
arts
and
industries
for
the
behoof
of
his
infant
city
even
the
mystic
and
difficult
art
of
impressing
written
characters
on
clay
it
is
a
beautiful
picture
which
we
have
from
the
old
legend
of
this
wisdom
daily
enlightening
the
life
of
the
little
white
city
near
the
waters
the
semites
possessed
a
deep
and
almost
instinctive
love
of
wisdom
in
the
writings
attributed
to
solomon
and
in
the
rich
and
wondrous
psalms
of
david
those
deep
mines
of
song
and
sagacity
we
find
the
glories
of
wisdom
again
and
again
extolled
even
yet
there
are
few
peoples
among
whom
the
love
of
scholarship
erudition
and
religious
wisdom
is
more
cultivated
for
its
own
sake
than
with
the
jews
these
rather
different
cultures
of
the
north
and
south
working
toward
a
common
centre
met
and
fused
at
a
period
prior
to
the
commencement
of
history
and
we
even
find
the
city
of
ur
whence
abram
came
a
near
neighbour
of
eridu
colonized
by
nippur
the
culture
of
eridu
prevailed
nevertheless
and
its
mightiest
offshoot
was
the
ultimate
centre
of
euphratean
civilization
babylon
itself
the
first
founders
of
the
city
were
undoubtedly
of
sumerian
stock
the
expression
being
that
in
vogue
among
modern
scholars
for
the
older
and
therefore
interchangeable
with
it
the
semite
conquerors
it
was
probably
about
the
time
of
the
juncture
of
the
civilizations
of
eridu
and
nippur
that
the
semites
entered
the
country
there
are
indications
which
lead
to
the
belief
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
semitic
immigrants
in
egypt
they
came
originally
from
arabia
the
semite
readily
accepted
the
sumerian
civilization
which
he
found
flourishing
in
the
valley
of
the
euphrates
and
adapted
the
sumerian
system
of
writing
to
his
own
language
in
what
manner
will
be
indicated
later
but
the
sumerians
themselves
were
not
above
borrowing
from
the
rich
semitic
tongue
and
many
of
the
earliest
sumerian
texts
we
encounter
are
strongly
semitized
but
although
the
semites
appear
to
have
filtered
into
sumerian
territory
by
way
of
eridu
and
ur
the
first
definite
notices
we
have
of
their
presence
within
it
are
in
the
monuments
of
the
more
northern
portion
of
that
territory
in
what
is
known
as
akkad
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bagdad
where
they
founded
a
small
kingdom
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
jutes
founded
the
kingdom
of
kent
the
earliest
monuments
however
come
from
lagash
the
modern
some
thirty
miles
north
of
ur
and
recount
the
dealings
of
the
of
that
place
with
other
neighbouring
dignitaries
the
priests
of
lagash
became
kings
and
their
conquests
extended
beyond
the
confines
of
babylonia
to
elam
on
the
east

but
the
first
great
semitic
empire
in
babylonia
was
that
founded
by
the
famous
sargon
of
akkad
as
is
the
case
with
many
popular
heroes
and
monarchs
whose
deeds
are
remembered
in
song
and
story
for
example
perseus
œdipus
cyrus
romulus
and
our
own
king
arthur
the
early
years
of
sargon
were
passed
in
obscurity
sargon
is
in
fact
one
of
the
children
he
was
legend
stated
born
in
concealment
and
sent
adrift
like
moses
in
an
ark
of
bulrushes
on
the
waters
of
the
euphrates
whence
he
was
rescued
and
brought
up
by
one
akki
a
husbandman
but
the
time
of
his
recognition
at
length
arrived
and
he
received
the
crown
of
babylonia
his
foreign
conquests
were
extensive
on
four
successive
occasions
he
invaded
syria
and
palestine
which
he
succeeded
in
welding
into
a
single
empire
with
babylonia
pressing
his
victories
to
the
margin
of
the
mediterranean
he
erected
upon
its
shores
statues
of
himself
as
an
earnest
of
his
conquests
he
also
overcame
elam
and
northern
mesopotamia
and
quelled
a
rebellion
of
some
magnitude
in
his
own
dominions
his
son
claimed
for
himself
the
title
of
king
of
the
four
zones
and
enlarged
the
empire
left
him
by
his
father
penetrating
even
into
arabia
a
monument
unearthed
by
de
morgan
at
susa
depicts
him
triumphing
over
the
conquered
elamites
he
is
seen
passing
his
spear
through
the

emblematic
of
divinity
for
the
early
babylonian
kings
were
the
direct
vicegerents
of
the
gods
on
earth
even
at
this
comparatively
early
time
the
resources
of
the
country
had
been
well
exploited
by
its
semitic
conquerors
and
their
absorption
of
the
sumerian
civilization
had
permitted
them
to
make
very
considerable
progress
in
the
enlightened
arts
some
of
their
work
in
and
even
in
the
lesser
if
equally
difficult
craft
of
is
among
the
finest
efforts
of
babylonian
art
nor
were
they
deficient
in
more
utilitarian
fields
they
constructed
roads
through
the
most
important
portions
of
the
empire
along
which
a
service
of
posts
carried

intervals

the
first
library
in
babylonia
sargon
is
also
famous
as
the
first
founder
of
a
babylonian
library
this
library
appears
to
have
contained
works
of
a
most
surprising
nature
having
regard
to
the
period
at
which
it
was
instituted
one
of
these
was
entitled
observations
of
and
consisted
of
no
less
than
books
dealing
with
astronomical
matters
of
considerable
complexity
it
registered
and
described
the
appearances
of
comets
conjunctions
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
the
phases
of
the
planet
venus
besides
recording
many
eclipses
this
wonderful
book
was
long
afterward
translated
into
greek
by
the
babylonian
historian
berossus
and
it
demonstrates
the
great
antiquity
of
babylonian
astronomical
science
even
at
this
very
early
epoch
another
famous
work
contained
in
the
library
of
sargon
dealt
with
omens
the
manner
of
casting
them
and
their
interpretation
a
very
important
of
babylonian
practice
among
the
conquests
of
this
great
monarch
whose
splendour
shines
through
the
shadows
of
antiquity
like
the
distant
flash
of
arms
on
a
misty
day
was
the
fair
island
of
cyprus
even
imagination
reels
at
the
assertion
that
five
thousand
seven
hundred
years
ago
the
keels
of
a
babylonian
conqueror
cut
the
waves
of
the
mediterranean
and
landed
upon
the
shores
of
flowery
cyprus
stern
semitic
warriors
who
loading
themselves
with
loot
erected
statues
of
their
royal
leader
and
returned
with
their
booty
in
a
cyprian
temple
de
cesnola
discovered
down
in
the
lowest
vaults
a
hæmatite
cylinder
which
described
its
owner
as
a
servant
of
the
son
of
sargon
so
that
a
certain
degree
of
communication
must
have
been
kept
up
between
babylonia
and
the
distant
island
just
as
early
egypt
and
crete
were
bound
to
each
other
by
ties
of
culture
and
commerce
gudea
but
the
empire
which
sargon
had
founded
was
doomed
to
precipitate
ruin
the
seat
of
power
was
diverted
southward
to
ur
in
the
reign
of
dungi
one
of
the
monarchs
who
ruled
from
this
southern
sphere
a
great
vassal
of
the
throne
gudea
stands
out
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characters
in
early
babylonian
antiquity
this
gudea
was
of
lagash
a
city
perhaps
thirty
miles
north
of
ur
and
was
famous
as
a
patron
of
the
architectural
and
allied
arts
he
ransacked
western
asia
for
building
materials
arabia
supplied
him
with
copper
for
ornamentation
the
amames
mountains
with
the
quarries
of
lebanon
with
stone
while
the
deserts
adjacent
to
palestine
furnished
him
with
rich
stones
of
all
kinds
for
use
in
decorative
work
and
districts
on
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
with
timber
for
ordinary
building
purposes
his
architectural
ability
is
vouched
for
by
a
plan
of
his
palace
measured
to
scale
which
is
carved
upon
the
lap
of
one
of
his
statues
in
the
louvre
there
is
no
intention
in
this
sketch
to
follow
minutely
the
events
in
the
history
of
babylonia
and
assyria
the
purpose
is
to
depict
and
describe
the
circumstances
deeds
and
times
of
its
most
outstanding
figures
its
most
typical
and
characteristic
rulers
by
following
this
plan
we
hope
to
be
better
able
to
present
the
reader
with
a
more
faithful
and
genuine
picture
of
the
civilization
the
myths
of
which
we
are
about
to
peruse
than
if
we
squandered
space
and
time
in
the
description
of
the
reigns
of
kings
during
whose
tenure
of
the
throne
no
event
of
importance
is
recorded
illustration

the

like

which
preceded
it
the
dynasty
of
ur
fell
and
arabian
or
canaanite
invaders
usurped
the
royal
power
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
shepherd
kings
seized
the
sovereignty
of
egypt
a
subsequent
foreign
yoke
that
of
elam
was
thrown
off
by
khammurabi
perhaps
the
most
celebrated
and
most
popularly
famous
name
in
babylonian
history
this
brilliant
wise
and
politic
monarch
did
not
content
himself
with
merely
expelling
the
hated
elamites
but
advanced
to
further
conquest
with
such
success
that
in
the
year
of
his
reign
he
had
formed
babylonia
into
a
single
monarchy
with
the
capital
at
babylon
itself
under
the
fostering
care
of
khammurabi
babylonian
art
and
literature
unfolded
and
blossomed
with
a
luxuriance
surprising
to
contemplate
at
this
distance
of
time
it
is
astonishing
too
to
note
how
completely
he
succeeded
in
welding
into
one
homogeneous
whole
the
various
elements
of
the
empire
he
carved
out
for
himself
so
surely
did
he
unify
his
conquests
that
the
babylonian
power
as
he
left
it
survived
undivided
for
nearly
fifteen
hundred
years
the
welfare
of
his
subjects
of
all
races
was
constantly
his
care
no
one
satisfied
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
feared
to
approach
him
the
legal
code
which
he
formulated
and
which
remains
as
his
greatest
claim
to
the
applause
of
posterity
is
a
monument
of
wisdom
and
equity
if
sargon
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
arthur
of
babylonian
history
surely
khammurabi
is
its
alfred
the
circumstances
of
the
lives
of
the
two
monarchs
present
a
decidedly
similar
picture
both
had
in
their
early
years
to
free
their
country
from
a
foreign
yoke
both
instituted
a
legal
code
were
patrons
of
letters
and
assiduous
in
their
attention
to
the
wants
of
their
subjects
if
a
great
people
has
frequently
evolved
a
legal
code
of
sterling
merit
there
are
cases
on
record
where
such
an
institution
has
served
to
make
a
people
great
and
it
is
probably
no
injustice
to
the
semites
of
babylonia
to
say
of
them
that
the
code
of
khammurabi
made
them
what
they
were
a
copy
of
this
code
was
found
at
susa
by
de
morgan
and
is
now
in
the
louvre
what
the
babylonian
chronologists
called
first
dynasty
of
fell
in
its
turn
and
it
is
claimed
that
a
sumerian
line
of
eleven
kings
took
its
place
their
sway
lasted
for
years
a
statement
which
is
obviously
open
to
question
these
were
themselves
overthrown
and
a
kassite
dynasty
from
the
mountains
of
elam
was
founded
by
kandis
which
lasted
for
nearly
six
centuries
these
alien
monarchs
failed
to
retain
their
hold
on
much
of
the
asiatic
and
syrian
territory
which
had
paid
tribute
to
babylon
and
the
suzerainty
of
palestine
was
likewise
lost
to
them
it
was
at
this
epoch
too
that
the
of
asshur
in
the
north
took
the
title
of
king
but
they
appear
to
have
been
subservient
to
babylon
in
some
degree
assyria
grew
gradually
in
power
its
people
were
hardier
and
more
warlike
than
the
and
religious
folk
of
babylon
and
little
by
little
they
encroached
upon
the
weakness
of
the
southern
kingdom
until
at
length
an
affair
of
tragic
proportions
entitled
them
to
direct
interference
in
babylonian
politics
a
court
murder
the
circumstances
which
necessitated
this
intervention
are
not
unlike
those
of
the
assassination
of
king
alexander
of
serbia
and
draga
his
queen
that
happened
years
later
the
kassite
king
of
babylonia
had
married
the
daughter
of
of
assyria
but
the
match
did
not
meet
with
the
approval
of
the
kassite
faction
at
court
which
murdered
the
this
atrocious
act
met
with
swift
vengeance
at
the
hands
of
of
assyria
the
bride
father
a
monarch
of
active
and
statesmanlike
qualities
the
author
of
the
celebrated
series
of
letters

iv
of
egypt
unearthed
at
he
led
a
punitive
army
into
babylonia
hurled
from
the
throne
the
pretender
placed
there
by
the
kassite
faction
and
replaced
him
with
a
scion
of
the
legitimate
royal
stock
this
king
reigned
for
over
twenty
years
and
upon
his
decease
the
assyrians
still
nominally
the
vassals
of
the
babylonian
crown
declared
themselves
independent
of
it
not
content
with
such
a
revolutionary
measure
under
shalmaneser
i
they
laid
claim
to
the
suzerainty
of
the
region
and
extended
their
conquests
even
to

boundaries

numerous
other
confederacies

to
their
yoke
son
took
the
city
of
babylon
slew
its
king
bitilyasu
and
thus
completely
shattered
the
claim
of
the
older
state
to
supremacy
he
had
reigned
in
babylon
for
some
seven
years
when
he
was
faced
by
a
popular
revolt
which
seems
to
have
been
headed
by
his
own
son
who
slew
him
and
placed
on
the
throne
this
king
conquered
and
killed
the
assyrian
monarch
of
his
time
the
last
of
the
old
assyrian
royal
line
whose
death
necessitated
the
institution
of
a
new
dynasty
the
fifth
monarch
of
which
was
the
famous
or
to
confer
on
him
his
full
assyrian
title
came
to
the
throne
about
and
soon
commenced
the
career
of
active
conquest
which
was
to
render
his
name
one
of
the
most
famous
in
the
warlike
annals
of
assyria
campaigns
in
the
upper
euphrates
against
alien
immigrants
who
had
settled
there
were
followed
by
the
conquest
of
the
hittites
of
subarti
in
assyrian
territory
pressing
northward
toward
lake
van
in
the
kurdish
country
he
subsequently
turned
his
arms
westward
and
overran
malatia
cappadocia
and
the
aramæans
of
northern
syria
next
felt
the
force
of
his
arms
and
he
penetrated
on
this
occasion
even
to
the
sources
of
the
tigris
he
left
behind
him
the
character
of
a
great
warrior
a
great
hunter
and
a
great
builder
restoring
the
temples
of
asshur
and
hadad
or
rimmon
in
the
city
of
asshur
it
is
not
until
the
reign
of
iii
that
we
are
once
more
enabled
to
take
up
the
thread
of
assyrian
history
with
any
degree
of
certainty
in
this
reign
artistic
development
appears
to
have
proceeded
apace
but
it
can
not
be
said
of
that
in
him
culture
went
hand
in
hand
with
humanity
the
records
of
his
cruelties
being
long
and
revolting
his
successor
shalmaneser
ii
possessed
an
insatiable
thirst
for
military
glory
and
during
his
reign
of
years
overthrew
a
great
confederacy
of
syrian
chiefs
which
included
ahab
king
of
israel
he
was
disturbed
during
the
latter
part
of
his
reign
by
the
rebellion
of
his
eldest
son
but
his
second
son
came
to
his
father
assistance
and
his
faithful
adherence
secured
him
the
succession
to
the
throne
in
semiramis
the
great
it
was
probably
in
the
reign
of
this
monarch
that
the
queen
known
in
legend
as
semiramis
lived
it
would
have
been
wonderful
indeed
had
the
magic
of
her
name
not
been
connected
with
romance
by
the
oriental
imagination
semiramis
the
name
sparkles
and
scintillates
with
gems
of
legend
and
song
myth
magic
and
music
encircle
it
and
sweep
round
it
as
fairy
seas
surround
some
island
paradise
it
is
a
central
rose
in
the
chaplet
of
legend
it
has
been
enshrined
in
music
perhaps
the
most
divine
and
melodious
which
the
songful
soul
of
italy
has
ever
conceived
yet
not
more
beauteous
than
itself
let
us
introduce
into
the
iron
chain
of
assyrian
history
the
golden
link
of
the
legend
of
this
helen
of
the
east
and
having
heard
the
fictions
of
her
greatness
let
us
attempt
to
remove
the
veils
which
hide
her
real
personality
from
view
and
look
upon
her
as
she
was
sammuramat
the
babylonian
queen
and
favourite
of
who
crushed
the
assembled
armies
of
media
and
chaldea
and
whose
glories
are
engraved
upon
a
column
which
setting
forth
the
tale
of
her
conquests
describes
her
in
all
simplicity
as
a
woman
of
the
palace
of
king
of
the
world
legend
says
that
ninus
king
of
assyria
having
conquered
the
babylonians
proceeded
toward
armenia
with
the
object
of
reducing
the
people
of
that
country
but
its
politic
king
barsanes
unable
to
meet
him
by
armed
force
made
a
voluntary
submission
accompanied
by
presents
of
such
magnificence
that
ninus
was
placated
but
insatiable
in
his
desire
for
conquest
he
turned
his
eyes
to
media
which
he
speedily
subdued
his
next
ambition
was
to
bring
under
his
rule
the
territory
between
the
tanais
and
the
nile
this
great
task
occupied
him
for
no
less
than
seventeen
years
by
which
time
all
asia
had
submitted
to
him
with
the
single
exception
of
bactria
which
still
maintained
its
independence
having
laid
the
foundations
of
the
city
of
nineveh
he
resolved
to
proceed
against
the
bactrians
his
army
was
of
dimensions
truly
mythical
for
he
was
said
to
be
accompanied
by
of
infantrymen
of
with
the
addition
of
chariots
equipped
with
scythes
it
was
during
this
campaign
says
diodorus
siculus
that
ninus
first
beheld
semiramis
her
precise
legendary
or
mythical
origin
is
obscure
some
writers
aver
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
ataryatis
or
derketo
and
oannes
the
babylonian
god
of
wisdom
who
has
already
been
alluded
to
ataryatis
was
a
goddess
of
ascalon
in
syria
and
after
birth
her
daughter
semiramis
was
miraculously
fed
by
doves
until
she
was
found
by
one
simmas
the
royal
shepherd
who
brought
her
up
and
married
her
to
onnes
or
menon
one
of
generals
he
fell
by
his
own
hand
and
ninus
thereupon
took
semiramis
to
wife
having
profoundly
admired
her
ever
since
her
conduct
at
the
capture
of
bactria
where
she
had
greatly
distinguished
herself
not
long
afterward
ninus
died
leaving
a
son
called
ninyas
during
her
son
minority
semiramis
assumed
the
regency
and
the
first
great
work
she
undertook
was
the
interment
of
her
husband
whom
she
buried
with
great
splendour
and
raised
over
him
a
mound
of
earth
no
less
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
high
and
proportionally
wide
after
which
she
built
babylon
this
city
being
finished
she
made
an
expedition
into
media
and
wherever
she
went
left
memorials
of
her
power
and
munificence
she
erected
vast
structures
forming
lakes
and
laying
out
gardens
of
great
extent
particularly
in
chaonia
and
ecbatana
in
short
she
levelled
hills
and
raised
mounds
of
an
immense
height
which
retained
her
name
for
ages
after
this
she
invaded
egypt
and
conquered
ethiopia
with
the
greater
part
of
libya
and
having
accomplished
her
wish
and
there
being
no
enemy
to
cope
with
her
excepting
the
kingdom
of
india
she
resolved
to
direct
her
forces
toward
that
quarter
she
had
an
army
of
foot
horse
and
chariots
for
the
passing
of
rivers
and
engaging
the
enemy
by
water
she
had
procured
ships
to
be
so
constructed
as
to
be
taken
to
pieces
for
the
advantage
of
carriage
which
ships
were
built
in
bactria
by
men
from
ph
oe
nicia
syria
and
cyprus
with
these
she
fought
a
naval
engagement
with
strabrobates
king
of
india
and
at
the
first
encounter
sunk
a
thousand
of
his
ships
after
this
she
built
a
bridge
over
the
river
indus
and
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
the
country
here
strabrobates
engaged
her
being
deceived
by
the
numerous
appearance
of
her
elephants
he
at
first
gave
way
for
being
deficient
in
those
animals
she
had
procured
the
hides
of
black
oxen
which
being
properly
sewn
and
stuffed
with
straw
presented
the
appearance
of
so
many
elephants
all
this
was
done
so
naturally
that
even
the
real
elephants
of
the
indian
king
were
deceived
but
the
stratagem
was
at
last
discovered
and
semiramis
was
obliged
to
retreat
after
having
lost
a
great
part
of
her
army
soon
after
this
she
resigned
the
government
to
her
son
ninyas
and
died
according
to
some
writers
she
was
slain
by
his
hand
it
was
through
the
researches
of
professor
of
berlin
that
the
true
personal
significance
of
semiramis
was
recovered
until
the
year
the
legends
of
diodorus
and
others
were
held
to
have
been
completely
disproved
and
semiramis
was
regarded
as
a
purely
mythical
figure
old
bryant
in
his
published
at
the
beginning
of
last
century
proves
the
legendary
status
of
semiramis
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
says
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
generality
of
historians
have
represented
semiramis
as
a
woman
and
they
describe
her
as
a
great
princess
who
reigned
in
babylon
but
there
are
writers
who
from
their
situation
had
opportunities
of
better
intelligence
and
by
those
she
is
mentioned
as
a
deity
the
syrians
says
athenagoras
worshipped
semiramis
and
adds
that
she
was
esteemed
the
daughter
of
dercatus
and
the
same
as
the
suria
dea
semiramis
was
said
to
have
been
born
at
ascalon
because
atargatus
was
there
worshipped
under
the
name
of
dagon
and
the
same
memorials
were
preserved
there
as
at
hierapolis
and
babylon
these
memorials
related
to
a
history
of
which
the
dove
was
the
principal
type
it
was
upon
the
same
account
that
she
was
said
to
have
been
changed
to
a
dove
because
they
found
her
always
depicted
and
worshipped
under
that
form
from
the
above
i
think
it
is
plain
that
semiramis
was
an
emblem
and
that
the
name
was
a
compound
of
or
ramis
and
it
signified
divine
token
a
type
of
providence
and
as
a
military
ensign
for
as
such
it
was
used
it
may
with
some
latitude
be
interpreted
standard
of
the
most
high
it
consisted
of
the
figure
of
a
dove
which
was
probably
encircled
with
the
iris
as
those
two
emblems
were
often
represented
together
all
who
went
under
that
standard
or
who
paid
any
deference
to
that
emblem
were
styled
semarim
or
samorim
it
was
a
title
conferred
upon
all
who
had
this
device
for
their
national
insigne
there
is
much
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
typical
of
the
mythic
science
of
the
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
centuries
it
is
easy
to
see
how
myth
became
busy
with
the
name
of
the
assyrian
queen
whose
exploits
undoubtedly
aroused
the
enthusiasm
not
only
of
the
assyrians
themselves
but
of
the
peoples
surrounding
them
just
as
any
great
work
in
ancient
britain
was
ascribed
to
the
agency
of
merlin
or
arthur
so
such
monuments
as
could
not
otherwise
be
accounted
for
were
attributed
to
semiramis
western
asia
is
monumentally
eloquent
of
her
name
and
even
the
behistun
inscriptions
of
darius
have
been
placed
to
her
credit
herodotus
states
that
one
of
the
gates
of
babylon
was
called
after
her
and
that
she
raised
the
artificial
banks
that
confined
the
river
euphrates
her
fame
lasted
until
well
into
the
middle
ages
and
the
armenians
called
the
district
round
lake
van
shamiramagerd
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
her
fame
became
mingled
with
that
of
the
goddess
ishtar
she
possesses
the
same
attributes
the
dove
is
her
emblem
and
her
story
became
so
inextricably
intertwined
with
that
of
the
babylonian
goddess
that
she
ultimately
became
a
variant
of
her
the
story
of
semiramis
is
a
triumphant
vindication
of
the
manner
in
which
by
certain
mythical
processes
a
human
being
can
attain
the
rank
of
a
god
or
goddess
for
semiramis
was
originally
very
real
indeed
a
column
discovered
in
describes
her
as
a
woman
of
the
palace
of
king
of
the
world
king
of
assyria
king
of
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
this
dedication
indicates
that
semiramis
or
to
give
her
her
assyrian
title
sammuramat
evidently
possessed
an
immense
influence
over
her
husband
and
that
perhaps
as
that
influence
lasted
for
more
than
one
reign
so
that
the
legend
that
after
a
regency
of
years
she
delivered
up
the
kingdom
to
her
son
ninyas
may
have
some
foundation
in
fact
she
seems
to
have
made
war
against
the
medes
and
chaldeans
the
story
that
on
relinquishing
her
power
she
turned
into
a
dove
and
disappeared
may
mean
that
her
name
sammuramat
was
easily
connected
with
the
assyrian
the
word
for
and
for
a
person
of
her
subsequent
legendary
fame
the
mythical
connexion
with
ishtar
is
easily
accounted
for
the
second
assyrian
empire
what
is
known
as
the
second
assyrian
empire
commenced
with
the
reign
of
iii
who
organized
a
great
scheme
of
provincial
government
this
plan
appears
to
have
been
the
first
forecast
of
the
feudal
system
for
each

a
fixed
tribute
and
provided

great
efforts
were

the
object
of
imposing

of

religious
feelings
of
the
people
by
razing
to

city

because
of
the
revolt
of
the
citizens
the
campaign
he
made
against
hezekiah
king
of
judah
was
marked
by
a
complete
failure
hezekiah
had
allied
himself
with
the
philistine
princes
of
ascalon
and
ekron
but
when
he
saw
his
egyptian
allies
beaten
at
the
battle
of
eltekeh
he
endeavoured
to
buy
off
the
invaders
by
numerous
presents
though
without
success
the
wonderful
deliverance
of
jerusalem
from
the
forces
of
sennacherib
recorded
in
scripture
and
sung
by
byron
in
his
appears
to
have
a
good
foundation
in
fact
it
seems
that
the
assyrian
army
was
attacked
and
almost
decimated
by
plague
which
obliged
sennacherib
to
return
to
nineveh
but
it
is
not
likely
that
the
phenomenon
occurred
in

sennacherib

that

and
it
is
a
strange
coincidence
that
the
fate
which
legend
ascribes
to
sardanapalus
was
probably
that
which
really
overtook
the
brother
of
it
is
likely
that
the
of
sardanapalus
is
merely
a
legendary
statement
of
a
rite
well
known
to
semitic
religion
which
was
practised
at
tarsus
down
to
the
time
of
dio
chrysostom
and
the
memory
of
which
survives
in
other
greek
legends
especially
those
of
and
queen
dido
at
tarsus
an
annual
festival
was
held
and
a
pyre
erected
upon
which
the
local
heracles
or
baal
was
burned
in
effigy
this
annual
commemoration
of
the
death
of
the
god
in
fire
probably
had
its
origin
in
the
older
rite
in
which
an
actual
man
or
sacred
animal
was
burned
as
representing
the
deity
golden
contains
an
instructive
passage
concerning
the
myth
of
sardanapalus
sir
james
frazer
writes
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
name
sardanapalus
is
only
the
greek
way
of
representing
ashurbanapal
the
name
of
the
greatest
and
nearly
the
last
king
of
assyria
but
the
records
of
the
real
monarch
which
have
come
to
light
within
recent
years
give
little
support
to
the
fables
that
attached
to
his
name
in
classical
tradition
for
they
prove
that
far
from
being
the
effeminate
weakling
he
seemed
to
the
greeks
of
a
later
age
he
was
a
warlike
and
enlightened
monarch
who
carried
the
arms
of
assyria
to
distant
lands
and
fostered
at
home
the
growth
of
science
and
letters
still
though
the
historical
reality
of
king
ashurbanapal
is
as
well
attested
as
that
of
alexander
or
charlemagne
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
myths
gathered
like
clouds
around
the
great
figure
that
loomed
large
in
the
stormy
sunset
of
assyrian
glory
now
the
two
features
that
stand
out
most
prominently
in
the
legends
of
sardanapalus
are
his
extravagant
debauchery
and
his
violent
death
in
the
flames
of
a
great
pyre
on
which
he
burned
himself
and
his
concubines
to
save
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
his
victorious
enemies
it
is
said
that
the
womanish
king
with
painted
face
and
arrayed
in
female
attire
passed
his
days
in
the
seclusion
of
the
harem
spinning
purple
wool
among
his
concubines
and
wallowing
in
sensual
delights
and
that
in
the
epitaph
which
he
caused
to
be
carved
on
his
tomb
he
recorded
that
all
the
days
of
his
life
he
ate
and
drank
and
toyed
remembering
that
life
is
short
and
full
of
trouble
that
fortune
is
uncertain
and
that
others
would
soon
enjoy
the
good
things
which
he
must
leave
behind
these
traits
bear
little
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
ashurbanapal
either
in
life
or
death
for
after
a
brilliant
career
of
conquest
the
assyrian
king
died
in
old
age
at
the
height
of
human
ambition
with
peace
at
home
and
triumph
abroad
the
admiration
of
his
subjects
and
the
terror
of
his
foes
but
if
the
traditional
characteristics
of
sardanapalus
harmonize
but
ill
with
what
we
know
of
the
real
monarch
of
that
name
they
fit
well
enough
with
all
that
we
know
or
can
conjecture
of
the
mock
kings
who
led
a
short
life
and
a
merry
during
the
revelry
of
the
sacæa
the
asiatic
equivalent
of
the
saturnalia
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
for
the
most
part
such
men
with
death
staring
them
in
the
face
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
sought
to
drown
care
and
deaden
fear
by
plunging
madly
into
all
the
fleeting
joys
that
still
offered
themselves
under
the
sun
when
their
brief
pleasures
and
sharp
sufferings
were
over
and
their
bones
or
ashes
mingled
with
the
dust
what
more
natural
that
on
their
tomb
those
mounds
in
which
the
people
saw
not
untruly
the
graves
of
the
lovers
of
semiramis
there
should
be
carved
some
such
lines
as
those
which
tradition
placed
in
the
mouth
of
the
great
assyrian
king
to
remind
the
heedless
of
the
shortness
and
vanity
of
life
according
to
sir
james
frazer
then
the
real
sardanapalus
may
have
been
one
of
those
mock
kings
who
led
a
short
but
merry
existence
before
a
sacrifice
ended
their
convivial
career
we
have
analogous
instances
in
the
sacrifice
of
sandan
at
tarsus
and
that
of
the
representative
of
the
mexican
god
tezcatlipoca
the
legend
of
sardanapalus
is
thus
a
distorted
reminiscence
of
the
death
of
a
magnificent
king
sacrificed
in
name
of
a
god
when
the
real
succeeded
as
king
of
assyria
his
brother
was
created
viceroy
of
babylonia
but
shortly
after
he
claimed
the
kingship
itself
revived
the
old
sumerian
language
as
the
official
tongue
of
the
babylonian
court
and
initiated
a
revolt
which
shook
the
assyrian
empire
from
one
end
to
the
other
a
great
struggle
ensued
between
the
northern
and
southern
powers
and
at
last
babylon
was
forced
to
surrender
through
starvation
and
was
put
to
death
like
sardanapalus
his
legendary
counterpart
found
himself
surrounded
by
enemies
having
conquered
elam
as
well
as
babylonia
he
had
to
face
the
inroads
of
hordes
of
scythians
who
poured
over
his
frontiers
he
succeeded
in
defeating
and
slaying
one
of
their
chiefs
dugdamme
whom
in
an
inscription
he
calls
a
limb
of
satan
but
shortly
after
this
he
died
himself
his
empire
was
already
in
a
state
of
decay
and
had
not
long
to
stand
the
first
great
library
but
if
was
effeminate
and
lax
in
government
he
was
the
first
great
patron
of
literature
it
is
to
his
magnificent
library
at
nineveh
that
we
owe
practically
all
that
we
have
preserved
of
the
literature
that
was
produced
in
babylonia
he
saw
that
the
southern
part
of
his
empire
was
far
more
intellectual
and
cultured
than
assyria
and
he
despatched
numerous
scribes
to
the
temple
schools
of
the
south
where
they
copied
extensively
from
their
archives
every
description
of
literary
curiosity
hymns
legends
medical
prescriptions
myths
and
rituals
were
all
included
in
the
great
library
at
nineveh
these
through
the
labours
of
layard
and
rassam
have
been
restored
to
us
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
instance
of
antiquarian
zeal
in
an
epoch
which
we
regard
as
not
far
distant
from
the
beginnings
of
verifiable
history
nearly
twenty
thousand
fragments
of
brick
bearing
the
results
of
researches
are
housed
in
the
british
museum
and
this
probably
represents
only
a
portion
of
his
entire
collection
political
motives
have
been
attributed
to
in
thus
bringing
together
such
a
great
library
it
has
been
argued
that
he
desired
to
make
assyria
the
centre
of
the
religious
influence
of
the
empire
this
would
derogate
greatly
from
the
view
that
sees
in
him
a
king
solely
fired
with
the
idea
of
preserving
and
retaining
all
that
was
best
in
ancient
babylonian
literature
in
the
north
as
well
as
in
the
south
and
having
beside
him
for
his
own
personal
use
those
records
which
many
circumstances
prove
he
was
extremely
desirous
of
obtaining
thus
we
find
him
sending
officials
on
special
missions
to
obtain
copies
of
certain
works
it
is
also
significant
that
placed
his
collection
in
a
library
and
not
in
a
temple
a
fact
which
discounts
the
theory
that
his
collection
of
literature
had
a
basis
the
last
kings
of
assyria
after
the
death
of
the

the

probably
the

of
the

reigned
for
some
years

he

its
king

to
death

the
king
whom
the
babylonian
monarch
set
up
in

place
was
deposed

power
vested
in

the
principal
inhabitants
were

captive

and
the
city
was
reduced
to
a
condition
of
insignificance
this
the
first
exile
of
the
jews
lasted
for
seventy
years
the
story
of
this
captivity
and
of
nebuchadrezzar
treatment
of
the
jewish
exiles
is
graphically
told
in
the
book
of
daniel
whom
the
babylonians
called
belteshazzar
daniel
refused
to
eat
the
meat
of
the
babylonians
probably
because
it
was
not
prepared
according
to
jewish
rite
he
and
his
companions
ate
pulse
and
drank
water
and
fared
upon
it
better
than
the
babylonians
on
strong
meats
and
wines
the
king
hearing
of
this
circumstance
sent
for
them
and
found
them
much
better
informed
than
all
his
magicians
and
astrologers
nebuchadrezzar
dreamed
dreams
and
informed
the
babylonian
astrologers
that
if
they
were
unable
to
interpret
them
they
would
be
cut
to
pieces
and
their
houses
destroyed
whereas
did
they
interpret
the
visions
they
would
be
held
in
high
esteem
they
answered
that
if
the
king
would
tell
them
his
dream
they
would
show
the
interpretation
thereof
but
the
king
said
that
if
they
were
wise
men
in
truth
they
would
know
the
dream
without
requiring
to
be
told
it
and
upon
some
of
the
astrologers
of
the
court
replying
that
the
request
was
unreasonable
he
was
greatly
incensed
and
ordered
all
of
them
to
be
slain
but
in
a
vision
of
the
night
the
secret
was
revealed
to
daniel
who
begged
that
the
wise
men
of
babylon
be
not
destroyed
and
going
to
a
court
official
he
offered
to
interpret
the
dream
he
told
the
king
that
in
his
dream
he
had
beheld
a
great
image
whose
brightness
and
form
were
terrible
the
head
of
this
image
was
of
fine
gold
the
breast
and
arms
of
silver
and
the
other
parts
of
brass
excepting
the
legs
which
were
of
iron
and
the
feet
which
were
partly
of
that
metal
and
partly
of
clay
but
a
stone
was
cast
at
it
which
smote
the
image
upon
its
feet
and
it
brake
into
pieces
and
the
wind
swept
away
the
remnants
the
stone
that
had
smitten
it
became
a
great
mountain
and
filled
the
whole
earth
then
daniel
proceeded
to
the
interpretation
the
king
he
said
represented
the
golden
head
of
the
image
the
silver
an
inferior
kingdom
which
would
rise
after
nebuchadrezzar
death
and
a
third
of
brass
which
should
bear
rule
over
all
the
earth
the
fourth
dynasty
from
nebuchadrezzar
would
be
as
strong
as
iron
but
since
the
toes
of
the
image
feet
were
partly
of
iron
and
partly
of
clay
so
should
that
kingdom
be
partly
strong
and
partly
broken
nebuchadrezzar
was
so
awed
with
the
interpretation
that
he
fell
upon
his
face
and
worshipped
daniel
telling
him
how
greatly
he
honoured
the
god
who
could
have
revealed
such
secrets
to
him
and
he
set
him
as
ruler
over
the
whole
province
of
babylon
and
made
him
chief
of
the
governors
over
all
the
wise
men
of
that
kingdom
but
daniel
three
companions
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
refused
to
worship
a
golden
image
which
the
king
had
set
up
and
he
commanded
that
they
should
be
cast
into
a
fiery
furnace
through
which
they
passed
unharmed

this
circumstance
still
more
turned
the
heart
of
nebuchadrezzar
in
the
direction
of
the
god
of
israel
a
second
dream
which
he
had
he
begged
daniel
to
interpret
he
said
he
had
seen
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
of
more
than
natural
height
which
flourished
and
was
exceedingly
strong
so
that
it
reached
to
heaven
so
abundant
was
the
fruit
of
this
tree
that
it
provided
meat
for
the
whole
earth
and
so
ample
its
foliage
that
the
beasts
of
the
field
had
shadow
under
it
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
dwelt
in
its
midst
a
spirit
descended
from
heaven
and
called
aloud
demanding
that
the
tree
should
be
cut
down
and
its
leaves
and
fruit
scattered
but
that
its
roots
should
be
left
in
the
earth
surrounded
by
a
band
of
iron
and
brass
then
ordering
that
the
tree
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
a
man
the
voice
of
the
spirit
continued
to
ask
that
it
should
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
that
its
portion
should
be
with
the
beasts
in
the
grass
of
the
earth
let
his
heart
be
changed
from
a
man
said
the
voice
and
let
a
heart
be
given
him
and
let
seven
times
pass
over
him
then
was
daniel
greatly
troubled
he
kept
silence
for
a
space
until
the
king
begged
him
to
take
heart
and
speak
the
tree
he
announced
represented
nebuchadrezzar
himself
and
what
had
happened
to
it
in
the
vision
would
come
to
pass
regarding
the
great
king
of
babylon
he
would
be
driven
from
among
men
and
his
dwelling
would
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
he
would
be
made
to
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
seven
times
would
pass
over
him
till
he
knew
and
recognized
that
the
most
high
ruled
in
the
kingdom
of
man
and
gave
it
to
whomsoever
he
desired
twelve
months
after
this
nebuchadrezzar
was
in
the
midst
of
his
palace
at
babylon
boasting
of
what
he
had
accomplished
during
his
reign
when
a
voice
from
heaven
spake
saying
o
king
nebuchadrezzar
to
thee
it
is
spoken
the
kingdom
is
departed
from
thee
and
straightway
was
nebuchadrezzar
driven
from
man
and
he
did
eat
grass
as
an
ox
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
till
his
hair
was
grown
like
eagle
feathers
and
his
nails
like
bird
claws
at
the
termination
of
his
time
of
trial
nebuchadrezzar
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
praising
the
most
high
admitted
his
domination
over
the
whole
earth
thus
was
the
punishment
of
the
boaster
completed
it
has
been
stated
with
some
show
of
probability
that
the
judgment
upon
nebuchadrezzar
was
connected
with
that
weird
disease
known
as
lycanthropy
from
the
greek
words
a
wolf
and
a
man
it
develops
as
a
kind
of
hysteria
and
is
characterized
by
a
belief
on
the
part
of
the
victim
that
he
has
become
an
animal
there
are
too
cravings
for
strange
food

about
on

of

it
will
be
of

to
examine
at

one
of
the
ancient
authorities
upon
babylonian
history
berossus
a
priest
of
bel
at
babylon
who
lived
about
compiled
from
native
documents
a
history
of
his
country
which
he
published
in
greek
his
writings
have
perished
but
extracts
from
them
have
been
preserved
by
josephus
and
eusebius
there
is
a
good
deal
of
myth
in
berossus
work
especially
when
he
deals
with
the
question
of
cosmology
the
story
of
the
deluge
and
so
forth
also
the
which
he
places
before
us
as
history
can
not
be
reconciled
with
those
inscribed
on
the
monuments
he
seems
indeed
to
have
arranged
his
history
so
that
it
should
exactly
fill
the
assumed
period
of
years
beginning
with
the
creation
of
man
and
ending
with
the
conquest
of
babylon
by
alexander
the
great
berossus
tells
of
a
certain
sisuthrus
whose
history
will
be
recounted
in
full
in
another
chapter
he
then
relates
a
legend
of
the
advent
of
the
or
oannes
from
the
waters
of
the
persian
gulf
indeed
he
alludes
to
three
beings
of
this
type
who
one
after
another
appeared
to
instruct
the
babylonians
in
arts
and
letters
berossus
account
of
the
deluge
more
important
is
his
account
of
the
deluge
there
is
more
than
one
babylonian
version
of
the
deluge
that
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
is
given
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
that
poem
as
berossus
account
is
quite
as
important
we
shall
give
it
in
his
own
words
before
commenting
upon
it
after
the
death
of
ardates
his
son
sisuthrus
succeeded
and
reigned
eighteen
sari
in
his
time
happened
the
great
deluge
the
history
of
which
is
given
in
this
manner
the
deity
cronus
appeared
to
him
in
a
vision
and
gave
him
notice
that
upon
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
dæsius
there
would
be
a
flood
by
which
mankind
would
be
destroyed
he
therefore
enjoined
him
to
commit
to
writing
a
history
of
the
beginning
procedure
and
final
conclusion
of
all
things
down
to
the
present
term
and
to
bury
these
accounts
securely
in
the
city
of
the
sun
at
sippara
he
then
ordered
sisuthrus
to
build
a
vessel
and
to
take
with
him
into
it
his
friends
and
relations
and
trust
himself
to
the
deep
the
latter
implicitly
obeyed
and
having
conveyed
on
board
every
thing
necessary
to
sustain
life
he
took
in
also
all
species
of
animals
that
either
fly
or
rove
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
having
asked
the
deity
whither
he
was
to
go
he
was
answered
to
the
gods
upon
which
he
offered
up
a
prayer
for
the
good
of
mankind
thus
he
obeyed
the
divine
admonition
and
the
vessel
which
he
built
was
five
stadia
in
length
and
in
breadth
two
into
this
he
put
every
thing
which
he
had
got
ready
and
last
of
all
conveyed
into
it
his
wife
children
and
friends
after
the
flood
had
been
upon
the
earth
and
was
in
time
abated
sisuthrus
sent
out
some
birds
from
the
vessel
which
not
finding
any
food
nor
any
place
to
rest
their
feet
returned
to
him
again
after
an
interval
of
some
days
he
sent
them
forth
a
second
time
and
they
now
returned
with
their
feet
tinged
with
mud
he
made
trial
a
third
time
with
these
birds
but
they
returned
to
him
no
more
from
whence
he
formed
a
judgment
that
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
now
above
the
waters
having
therefore
made
an
opening
in
the
vessel
and
finding
upon
looking
out
that
the
vessel
was
driven
to
the
side
of
a
mountain
he
immediately
quitted
it
being
attended
with
his
wife
children
and
the
pilot
sisuthrus
immediately
paid
his
adoration
to
the
earth
and
having
constructed
an
altar
offered
sacrifices
to
the
gods
these
things
being
duly
performed
both
sisuthrus
and
those
who
came
out
of
the
vessel
with
him
disappeared
they
who
remained
in
the
vessel
finding
that
the
others
did
not
return
came
out
with
many
lamentations
and
called
continually
on
the
name
of
sisuthrus
him
they
saw
no
more
but
they
could
distinguish
his
voice
in
the
air
and
could
hear
him
admonish
them
to
pay
due
regard
to
the
gods
and
likewise
inform
them
that
it
was
upon
account
of
his
piety
that
he
was
translated
to
live
with
the
gods
that
his
wife
and
children
with
the
pilot
had
obtained
the
same
honour
to
this
he
added
that
he
would
have
them
make
the
best
of
their
way
to
babylonia
and
search
for
the
writings
at
sippara
which
were
to
be
made
known
to
all
mankind
the
place
where
these
things
happened
was
in
armenia
the
remainder
having
heard
these
words
offered
sacrifices
to
the
gods
and
taking
a
circuit
journeyed
towards
babylonia
berossus
adds
that
the
remains
of
the
vessel
were
to
be
seen
in
his
time
upon
one
of
the
corcyrean
mountains
in
armenia
and
that
people
used
to
scrape
off
the
bitumen
with
which
it
had
been
outwardly
coated
and
made
use
of
it
by
way
of
an
antidote
for
poison
or
amulet
in
this
manner
they
returned
to
babylon
and
having
found
the
writings
at
sippara
they
set
about
building
cities
and
erecting
temples
and
babylon
was
thus
inhabited
again
analogies
with
the
flood
myth
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
sisuthrus
the
hero
of
this
deluge
story
was
also
the
tenth
babylonian
king
just
as
noah
was
the
tenth
patriarch
the
birds
sent
out
by
sisuthrus
strongly
recall
the
raven
and
dove
despatched
by
noah
but
there
are
several
american
myths
which
introduce
this
conception
birds
and
beasts
in
many
cosmologies
provide
the
nucleus
of
the
new
world
which
emerges
from
the
waters
which
have
engulfed
the
old
perhaps
it
is
the
beaver
or
the
which
dives
into
the
abyss
and
brings
up
a
piece
of
mud
which
gradually
grows
into
a
spacious
continent
but
sometimes
birds
carry
this
nucleus
in
their
beaks
in
the
myth
under
consideration
they
return
with
mud
on
their
feet
which
is
obviously
expressive
of
the
same
idea
attempts
have
been
made
to
show
that
a
great
difference
exists
between
the
babylonian
and
hebrew
story
undoubtedly
the
two
stories
have
a
common
origin
the
first
babylonian
version
of
the
myth
dates
from
about
and
its
text
is
evidently
derived
from
a
still
older
tablet
it
seems
likely
that
this
was
in
turn
indebted
to
a
still
more
archaic
version
which
probably
recounted
the
earliest
type
of
the
myth
this
perhaps
related
how
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
were
not
to
the
liking
of
the
creator
and
how
he
resolved
to
recreate
the
whole
the
great
was
therefore
called
in
to
submerge
the
world
after
which
the
creator
it
and
set
the
survivor
and
his
family
upon
it
as
the
ancestors
of
a
new
human
race
it
is
possible
also
that
the
great
or
serpent
which
was
slain
by
the
creator
may
have
flooded
the
earth
with
his
blood
as
he
expired
there
is
an
algonquin
indian
myth
to
this
effect
in
an
old
cuneiform
text
in
fact
the
year
of
the
deluge
is
alluded
to
as
the
year
of
the
raging
serpent
the
wise
man
who
takes
refuge
in
the
ship
or
ark
is
warned
by
a
dream
of
the
forthcoming
deluge
in
some
north
american
indian
myths
he
is
warned
by
friendly
animals
the
mountain
too
as
a
place
of
refuge
for
the
ark
is
fairly
common
in
myth
we
have
dealt
in
chapter
ii
with
the
creation
myth
found
in
berossus
and
with
this
ends
the
part
of
his
history
which
is
of
any
importance
babylonian
archæology
until
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
our
knowledge
of
the
history
and
antiquities
of
babylonia
and
assyria
was
extremely
scanty
the
deeply
interesting
series
of
excavations
which
unrolled
the
circumstances
of
these
ancient
civilizations
before
the
almost
incredulous
eyes
of
learned
europe
are
described
at
length
towards
the
close
of
this
volume
here
we
may
say
shortly
that
the
labours
of
layard
and
botta
at
nineveh
convinced
antiquaries
that
the
remains
of
a
great
civilization
awaited
discovery
layard
excavation
of
the
library
of
was
the
first
great
step
toward
reconstructing
the
ancient
life
of
the
two
kingdoms
he
was
followed
by
oppert
and
loftus
but
the
systematic
excavation
of
the
country
was
yet
to
be
undertaken
this
as
we
shall
see
was
commenced
by
george
smith
of
the
british
museum
but
unfortunately
he
died
on
his
way
home
from
the
east
his
work
at
nineveh
was
taken
up
by
mr
hormuzd
rassam
who
succeeded
in
unearthing
inscribed
tables
and
bronze
gates
in
a
few
years
afterward
mr
rassam
discovered
the
site
of
the
temple
of
the
of
sippara
at
to
the
of
bagdad
an
important
find
by
de
sarzec
was
that
of
the
diorite
statues
of
gudea
the
patesi
or
ruler
of
lagash
about
the
stone
of
which
according
to
the
inscriptions
upon
them
had
been
brought
from
the
sinaitic
peninsula
the
university
of
pennsylvania
sent
mr
haynes
in
to
excavate
at
nippur
where
he
unearthed
the
remains
of
the
great
temple
of
in
the
heart
of
which
is
a
mound
of
bricks
stamped
with
the
names
of
sargon
of
akkad
and
his
son
the
german
expedition
of
explored
the
ruins
of
babylon
the
palace
of
nebuchadrezzar
and
the
site
of
asshur
the
tower
of
babel
many
attempts
have
been
made
to
attach
the
legend
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
to
certain
ruined
towers
in
babylonia
especially
to
that
of
the
great
temple
of
merodach
and
some
remarks
upon
this
most
interesting
tale
may
not
be
out
of
place
at
this
point
the
myth
is
not
found
in
babylonia
itself
and
in
its
best
form
may
be
discovered
in
scripture
in
the
bible
story
we
are
told
that
every
region
was
of
one
tongue
and
mode
of
speech
as
men
journeyed
westward
from
their
original
home
in
the
east
they
encountered
a
plain
in
the
land
of
shinar
where
they
settled
in
this
region
they
commenced
building
operations
constructed
a
city
and
laid
the
foundations
of
a
tower
the
summit
of
which
they
hoped
would
reach
to
heaven
itself
it
would
appear
that
this
edifice
was
constructed
with
the
object
of
serving
as
a
great
landmark
to
the
people
so
that
they
should
not
be
scattered
over
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
lord
came
down
to
view
the
city
and
the
tower
and
he
considered
that
as
they
were
all
of
one
language
this
gave
them
undue
power
and
that
what
they
imagined
to
themselves
under
such
conditions
they
would
be
able
to
achieve
so
the
lord
scattered
them
abroad
from
thence
over
the
face
of
every
region
and
the
building
of
the
tower
ceased
and
the
name
of
it
was
called
because
at
that
place
the
single
language
of
the
people
was
confounded
of
course
it
is
merely
the
native
name
of
babylon
which
translated
means
of
the
god
and
has
no
such
etymology
as
the
scriptures
pretend
the
hebrews
confusing
their
verb
confuse
or
confound
with
the
word
the
story
was
no
doubt
suggested
by
one
of
the
temple
towers
of
babylon
over
and
over
again
we
find
in
connexion
with
the
jewish
religion
that
anything
which
savours
of
presumption
or
unnatural
aspiration
is
strongly
condemned
the
ambitious
effort
of
the
tower
of
babel
would
thus
seem
abhorrent
to
the
hebrews
of
old
the
strange
thing
is
that
these
ancient
towers
or
as
the
babylonians
called
them
were
intended
to
serve
as
a
link
between
heaven
and
earth
just
as
does
the
minaret
of
the
mahommedan
mosque
illustration
birs
nimrûd
the
tower
of
babel
from
or
exploration
and
adventure
on
the
by
p
by
permission
of
messrs
putnam
sons
the
legend
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
is
to
be
traced
in
other
than
that
of
babylon
it
is
found
in
central
america
where
the
story
runs
that
xelhua
one
of
the
seven
giants
rescued
from
the
deluge
built
the
great
pyramid
of
cholula
in
order
to
besiege
heaven
the
structure
was
however
destroyed
by
the
gods
who
cast
down
fire
upon
it
and
confounded
the
language
of
its
builders
livingstone
found
some
such
myth
among
the
african
tribes
around
lake
ngami
and
certain
australian
and
mongolian
peoples
possess
a
similar
tradition
nimrod
the
mighty
hunter
it
is
strange
that
the
dispersion
of
tribes
at
babel
should
be
connected
with
the
name
of
nimrod
who
figures
in
biblical
as
well
as
babylonian
tradition
as
a
mighty
hunter
epiphanius
states
that
from
the
very
foundation
of
this
city
babylon
there
commenced
an
immediate
scene
of
conspiracy
sedition
and
tyranny
which
was
carried
on
by
nimrod
the
son
of
chus
the
æthiop
around
this
dim
legendary
figure
a
great
deal
of
learned
controversy
has
raged
before
we
examine
his
legendary
and
mythological
significance
let
us
see
what
legend
and
scripture
say
of
him
in
the
book
of
genesis
chap
x
he
is
mentioned
as
a
mighty
hunter
before
yahweh
wherefore
it
is
said
even
as
nimrod
the
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
he
was
also
the
ruler
of
a
great
kingdom
the
beginning
of
his
kingdom
was
babel
and
erech
and
accad
and
calneh
in
the
land
of
shinar
out
of
that
land
went
forth
asshur
that
is
by
compulsion
of
nimrod
and
builded
nineveh
and
other
great
cities
in
the
scriptures
nimrod
is
mentioned
as
a
descendant
of
ham
but
this
may
arise
from
the
reading
of
his
name
as
which
in
the
scriptures
indicates
a
coloured
race
the
name
may
possibly
be
and
should
relate
to
the
cassites
it
appears
then
that
the
sons
of
cush
or
chus
the
cassites
according
to
legend
did
not
partake
of
the
general
division
of
the
human
race
after
the
fall
of
babel
but
under
the
leadership
of
nimrod
himself
remained
where
they
were
after
the
dispersion
nimrod
built
babylon
and
fortified
the
territory
around
it
it
is
also
said
that
he
built
nineveh
and
trespassed
upon
the
land
of
asshur
so
that
at
last
he
forced
asshur
to
quit
that
territory
the
greeks
gave
him
the
name
of
nebrod
or
nebros
and
preserved
or
invented
many
tales
concerning
him
and
his
apostasy
and
concerning
the
tower
which
he
is
supposed
to
have
erected
he
is
described
as
a
gigantic
person
of
mighty
bearing
and
a
contemner
of
everything
divine
his
followers
are
represented
as
being
equally
presumptuous
and
overbearing
in
fact
he
seems
to
have
appeared
to
the
greeks
very
much
like
one
of
their
own
titans
nimrod
has
been
identified
both
with
merodach
the
tutelar
god
of
babylon
and
with
gilgamesh
the
hero
of
the
epic
of
that
name
with
orion
and
with
others
the
name
according
to
petrie
has
even
been
found
in
egyptian
documents
of
the
xxii
dynasty
as
nimrod
seems
to
be
one
of
those
giants
who
rage
against
the
gods
as
do
the
titans
of
greek
myth
and
the
jotunn
of
scandinavian
story
all
are
in
fact
the
disorderly
forces
of
nature
who
were
defeated
by
the
deities
who
stood
for
law
and
order
the
derivation
of
the
name
nimrod
may
mean
in
all
his
later
legends
for
instance
those
of
them
that
are
related
by
philo
in
his
a
title
which
proves
that
nimrod
was
connected
with
the
giant
race
by
tradition
he
appears
as
treacherous
and
untrustworthy
the
theory
that
he
is
merodach
has
no
real
foundation
either
in
scholarship
or
probability
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
nimrod
legend
seems
to
be
very
much
more
archaic
than
any
piece
of
tradition
connected
with
merodach
who
indeed
is
a
god
of
no
very
great
antiquity
abram
and
nimrod
many
jewish
legends
bring
abram
into
relationship
with
nimrod
the
mythical
king
of
babylon
according
to
legend
abram
was
originally
an
idolater
and
many
stories
are
preserved
respecting
his
conversion
jewish
legend
states
that
the
father
of
the
faithful
originally
followed
his
father
terah
occupation
which
was
that
of
making
and
selling
images
of
clay
and
that
when
very
young
he
advised
his
father
to
leave
his
pernicious
trade
of
idolatry
by
which
he
imposed
on
the
world
the
jewish
rabbins
relate
that
on
one
occasion
his
father
terah
having
undertaken
a
considerable
journey
the
sale
of
the
images
devolved
on
him
and
it
happened
that
a
man
who
pretended
to
be
a
purchaser
asked
him
how
old
he
was
fifty
years
answered
the
patriarch
wretch
that
thou
art
said
the
man
for
adoring
at
that
age
a
thing
which
is
only
one
day
old
abram
was
astonished
and
the
exclamation
of
the
old
man
had
such
an
effect
upon
him
that
when
a
woman
soon
after
brought
some
flour
as
an
offering
to
one
of
the
idols
he
took
an
axe
and
broke
them
to
pieces
preserving
only
the
largest
one
into
the
hand
of
which
he
put
the
axe
terah
returned
home
and
inquired
what
this
havoc
meant
abram
replied
that
the
deities
had
quarrelled
about
an
offering
which
a
woman
had
brought
upon
which
the
larger
one
had
seized
an
axe
and
destroyed
the
others
terah
replied
that
he
must
be
in
jest
as
it
was
impossible
that
inanimate
statues
could
so
act
and
abram
immediately
retorted
on
his
father
his
own
words
showing
him
the
absurdity
of
worshipping
false
deities
but
terah
who
does
not
appear
to
have
been
convinced
delivered
abram
to
nimrod
who
then
dwelt
in
the
plain
of
shinar
where
babylon
was
built
nimrod
having
in
vain
exhorted
abram
to
worship
fire
ordered
him
to
be
thrown
into
a
burning
furnace
exclaiming
let
your
god
come
and
take
you
out
as
soon
as
haran
abram
youngest
brother
saw
the
fate
of
the
patriarch
he
resolved
to
conform
to
nimrod
religion
but
when
he
saw
his
brother
come
out
of
the
fire
unhurt
he
declared
for
the
god
of
abram
which
caused
him
to
be
thrown
in
turn
into
the
furnace
and
he
was
consumed
a
certain
writer
however
narrates
a
different
version
of
haran
death
he
says
that
he
endeavoured
to
snatch
terah
idols
from
the
flames
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
by
abram
and
was
burnt
to
death
in
consequence
a
persian
version
the
persian
mussulmans
allege
that
the
patriarch
who
was
born
in
chaldea
after
god
had
manifested
himself
to
him
proceeded
to
mecca
and
built
the
celebrated
kaaba
or
temple
there
when
he
returned
home
he
publicly
declared
himself
the
prophet
of
god
and
specially
announced
it
to
nimrod
king
of
chaldea
who
was
a
worshipper
of
fire
abram
met
nimrod
at
a
town
in
mesopotamia
called
urga
afterwards
caramit
and
now
diarbekr
in
which
was
a
large
temple
consecrated
to
fire
and
publicly
entreated
the
king
to
renounce
his
idolatry
and
worship
the
true
god
nimrod
consulted
his
wise
men
and
inquired
what
punishment
such
a
blasphemer
deserved
and
they
advised
that
he
should
be
consigned
to
the
flames
a
pile
of
wood
was
ordered
to
be
prepared
and
abram
was
placed
upon
it
but
to
their
astonishment
it
would
not
kindle
nimrod
asked
the
priests
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
and
they
replied
that
an
angel
was
constantly
flying
about
the
pile
and
preventing
the
wood
from
burning
the
king
asked
how
the
angel
could
be
driven
away
and
they
replied
that
it
could
only
be
done
by
some
dreadful
rite
their
advice
was
followed
but
the
angel
still
persisted
and
nimrod
at
length
banished
abram
from
his
dominions
the
mussulmans
also
relate
that
the
king
made
war
against
the
patriarch
and
when
he
was
marching
against
him
he
sent
a
person
to
him
with
this
message
o
abram
it
is
now
time
to
fight
where
is
thy
army
abram
answered
it
will
come
immediately
and
immediately
there
appeared
an
immense
cloud
of
gnats
which
devoured
nimrod
soldiers
to
the
very
bones
another
tradition
is
preserved
in
the
east
specially
referring
to
the
casting
of
abram
into
a
fiery
furnace
at
babylon
by
order
of
nimrod
which
seems
to
be
a
corrupted
story
of
the
deliverance
of
the
three
hebrews
recorded
by
daniel
nimrod
merely
substituted
for
nebuchadrezzar
as
no
evidence
exists
that
abram
ever
was
at
babylon
nimrod
it
is
said
in
a
dream
saw
a
star
rising
above
the
horizon
the
light
of
which
eclipsed
that
of
the
sun
the
soothsayers
who
were
consulted
foretold
that
a
child
was
to
be
born
in
babylon
who
shortly
would
become
a
great
prince
and
that
he
nimrod
had
reason
to
fear
him
terrified
at
this
answer
nimrod
gave
orders
to
search
for
such
an
infant
notwithstanding
this
precaution
however
adna
the
wife
of
azar
one
of
nimrod
guards
hid
her
child
in
a
cave
the
mouth
of
which
she
diligently
closed
and
when
she
returned
she
told
her
husband
that
it
had
perished
adna
in
the
meantime
proceeded
regularly
to
the
cave
to
nurse
the
infant
but
she
always
found
him
suckling
the
ends
of
his
fingers
one
of
which
furnished
him
milk
and
the
other
honey
this
miracle
surprised
her
and
as
her
anxiety
for
the
child
welfare
was
thus
greatly
relieved
and
as
she
saw
that
heaven
had
undertaken
the
care
she
merely
satisfied
herself
with
visiting
him
from
time
to
time
she
soon
perceived
that
he
grew
as
much
in
three
days
as
common
children
do
in
a
month
so
that
fifteen
moons
had
scarcely
passed
before
he
appeared
as
if
he
were
fifteen
years
of
age
adna
now
told
her
husband
azar
that
the
son
of
whom
she
had
been
delivered
and
whom
she
had
reported
dead
was
living
and
that
god
had
provided
miraculously
for
his
subsistence
azar
went
immediately
to
the
cave
where
he
found
his
son
and
desired
his
mother
to
convey
him
to
the
city
as
he
was
resolved
to
present
him
to
nimrod
and
place
him
about
the
court
in
the
evening
adna
brought
him
forth
out
of
his
den
and
conducted
him
to
a
meadow
where
herds
of
cattle
were
feeding
this
was
a
sight
entirely
new
to
the
young
abram
who
was
inquisitive
to
learn
their
nature
and
was
informed
by
his
mother
of
their
names
uses
and
qualities
abram
continued
his
inquiries
and
desired
to
know
who
produced
the
animals
adna
told
him
that
all
things
had
their
lord
and
creator
who
then
said
he
brought
me
into
the
world
i
replied
adna
and
who
is
your
lord
asked
abram
she
answered
azar
who
is
azar
lord
she
told
him
nimrod
he
showed
an
inclination
to
carry
his
inquiries
farther
but
she
checked
him
telling
him
that
it
was
not
convenient
to
search
into
other
matters
because
of
danger
at
last
he
came
to
the
city
the
inhabitants
of
which
he
perceived
deeply
engaged
in
superstition
and
idolatry
after
this
he
returned
to
his
grotto
one
evening
as
he
was
going
to
babylon
he
saw
the
stars
shining
and
among
others
venus
which
was
adored
by
many
he
said
within
himself
perhaps
this
is
the
god
and
creator
of
the
world
but
observing
some
time
after
that
this
star
was
set
he
said
this
certainly
can
not
be
the
maker
of
the
universe
for
it
is
not
possible
he
should
be
subject
to
such
a
change
soon
after
he
noticed
the
moon
at
full
and
thought
that
this
might
possibly
be
the
author
of
all
things
but
when
he
perceived
this
planet
also
sink
beneath
the
horizon
his
opinion
of
it
was
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
venus
at
length
near
the
city
he
saw
a
multitude
adoring
the
rising
sun
and
he
was
tempted
to
follow
their
example
but
having
seen
this
luminary
decline
like
the
rest
he
concluded
that
it
was
not
his
creator
his
lord
and
his
god
azar
presented
his
son
abram
to
nimrod
who
was
seated
on
a
lofty
throne
with
a
number
of
beautiful
slaves
of
both
sexes
in
attendance
abram
asked
his
father
who
was
the
person
so
much
exalted
above
the
rest
azar
answered
the
king
nimrod
whom
these
people
acknowledge
as
their
god
it
is
impossible
replied
abram
that
he
should
be
their
god
since
he
is
not
so
beautiful
and
consequently
not
so
perfect
as
the
generality
of
those
about
him
abram
now
took
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
his
father
about
the
unity
of
god
which
afterwards
drew
him
into
great
contests
with
the
principal
men
of
nimrod
court
who
would
by
no
means
acquiesce
in
the
truths
he
declared
nimrod
informed
of
these
disputes
commanded
him
as
we
have
already
mentioned
to
be
thrown
into
a
burning
furnace
out
of
which
he
came
without
receiving
the
least
hurt
the
fragments
of
babylonian
history
or
rather
historical
romance
occur
in
the
writings
of
early
authors
other
than
berossus
one
of
these
is
to
be
found
in
the
of
iamblichus
a
work
embracing
no
less
than
sixteen
books
by
a
native
of
chalchis
in
c
oe
who
was
much
enamoured
of
the
mysterious
ancient
life
of
babylonia
and
assyria
and
who
died
about
all
that
remains
of
what
is
palpably
a
romance
which
may
have
been
founded
upon
historical
probability
is
an
epitome
of
the
by
photius
which
still
further
condensed
is
as
follows
attracted
by
her
beauty
and
relying
on
his
own
great
power
garmus
king
of
babylon
decided
to
marry
sinonis
a
maiden
of
surpassing
beauty
she
however
was
already
in
love
with
another
rhodanes
and
discouraged
garmus
every
advance
her
attachment
became
known
to
the
king
but
did
not
alter
his
determination
and
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
attempt
at
flight
on
the
part
of
the
lovers
he
appointed
two
eunuchs
damas
and
saca
to
watch
their
movements
the
penalty
for
negligence
was
loss
of
ears
and
nose
and
that
penalty
the
eunuchs
suffered
in
spite
of
their
close
vigilance
the
lovers
escaped
damas
and
saca
were
however
placed
at
the
head
of
troops
and
despatched
to
recapture
the
fugitives
their
relentless
search
was
not
the
lovers
only
anxiety
for
in
seeking
refuge
with
some
shepherds
in
a
meadow
they
encountered
a
demon
a
satyr
which
in
the
shape
of
a
goat
haunted
that
part
of
the
country
this
demon
to
sinonis
horror
began
to
pay
her
all
sorts
of
weird
fantastic
attentions
and
finally
compelled
her
and
rhodanes
to
abandon
the
protection
of
the
shepherds
for
the
concealment
offered
by
a
cavern
here
they
were
discovered
by
damas
and
his
forces
and
must
have
been
captured
but
for
the
opportune
arrival
and
attack
of
a
swarm
of
poisonous
bees
which
routed
the
eunuchs
when
the
runaways
were
alone
again
they
tasted
and
ate
some
of
the
bees
honey
and
almost
immediately
lost
consciousness
later
damas
again
attacked
the
cavern
but
finding
the
lovers
still
unconscious
he
and
his
troops
left
them
there
for
dead
in
time
however
they
recovered
and
continued
their
flight
into
the
country
a
man
who
afterward
poisoned
his
brother
and
accused
them
of
the
crime
offered
them
sanctuary
only
the
suicide
of
this
man
saved
them
from
serious
trouble
and
probably
recapture
and
from
his
house
they
wandered
into
the
company
of
a
robber
here
again
the
troops
of
damas
came
upon
them
and
burned
their
dwelling
to
the
ground
in
desperation
the
fugitives
masqueraded
as
the
ghosts
of
the
people
the
robber
had
murdered
in
his
house
their
ruse
succeeded
and
once
again
their
pursuers
were
thrown
off
the
scent
they
next
encountered
the
funeral
of
a
young
girl
and
witnessed
her
apparent
return
to
life
almost
at
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
in
this
sepulchre
sinonis
and
rhodanes
slept
that
night
and
once
more
were
believed
to
be
dead
by
damas
and
his
soldiers
later
however
sinonis
tried
to
dispose
of
their
grave
clothes
and
was
arrested
in
the
act
soracchus
the
magistrate
of
the
district
decided
to
send
her
to
babylon
in
despair
she
and
rhodanes
took
some
poison
with
which
they
had
provided
themselves
against
such
an
emergency
this
had
been
anticipated
by
their
guards
however
with
the
result
that
a
sleeping
draught
had
been
substituted
for
the
poison
and
some
time
later
the
lovers
to
their
amazement
awoke
to
find
themselves
in
the
vicinity
of
babylon
overcome
by
such
a
succession
of
misfortunes
sinonis
stabbed
herself
though
not
fatally
soracchus
on
learning
this
was
moved
to
compassion
and
consented
to
the
escape
of
his
prisoners
illustration
the
murder
of
evelyn
paul
after
this
the
lovers
embarked
on
a
new
series
of
adventures
even
more
thrilling
than
those
which
had
gone
before
the
temple
of
venus
ishtar
situated
on
an
island
of
the
euphrates
was
their
first
destination
after
escaping
from
the
captivity
of
soracchus
here
sinonis
wound
was
healed
and
afterward
they
sought
refuge
with
a
cottager
whose
daughter
consented
to
dispose
of
some
trinkets
belonging
to
sinonis
in
doing
so
the
girl
was
mistaken
for
sinonis
and
news
that
sinonis
had
been
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
was
sent
at
once
to
garmus
while
selling
the
trinkets
the
cottage
girl
had
become
so
alarmed
by
the
suspicious
questions
and
manner
of
the
purchasers
that
she
hurried
home
with
all
possible
speed
on
her
way
back
her
curiosity
was
excited
by
sounds
of
a
great
disturbance
issuing
from
a
house
hard
by
and
on
entering
she
was
appalled
to
discover
a
man
in
the
very
act
of
taking
his
life
after
murdering
his
mistress
terrified
and
sprinkled
with
blood
she
sped
back
to
her
house
on
hearing
the
girl
story
sinonis
realised
that
the
safety
of
herself
and
rhodanes
lay
only
in
flight
they
prepared
at
once
to
go
but
before
starting
rhodanes
kissed
the
peasant
girl
sinonis
discovering
what
he
had
done
by
the
blood
on
his
lips
became
furious
with
jealousy
in
a
transport
of
rage
she
tried
to
stab
the
girl
and
on
being
prevented
rushed
to
the
house
of
setapo
a
wealthy
babylonian
of
evil
repute
setapo
welcomed
her
only
too
cordially
at
first
sinonis
pretended
to
meet
his
mood
but
as
time
went
by
she
relented
of
her
treatment
of
rhodanes
and
began
to
cast
about
for
some
means
of
escape
as
the
evening
wore
on
she
plied
setapo
with
wine
until
he
was
intoxicated
then
during
the
night
she
murdered
him
and
in
the
first
early
dawn
left
the
house
the
slaves
of
setapo
pursued
and
overtook
her
however
and
committed
her
to
custody
to
answer
for
her
crime
all
babylon
rejoiced
with
its
king
over
the
news
of
sinonis
discovery
so
great
was
garmus
delight
that
he
commanded
that
all
the
prisoners
throughout
his
dominions
should
be
released
and
in
this
general
boon
sinonis
shared
meanwhile
the
dog
of
rhodanes
had
scented
out
the
house
in
which
the
peasant
girl
had
witnessed
the
suicide
of
the
lover
who
had
murdered
his
mistress
and
while
the
animal
was
devouring
the
remains
of
the
woman
the
father
of
sinonis
arrived
at
the
same
house
thinking
the
mutilated
body
was
that
of
his
daughter
he
buried
it
and
on
the
tomb
he
placed
the
inscription
here
lies
the
beautiful
sinonis
some
days
later
rhodanes
passed
that
way
and
on
reading
the
inscription
added
to
it
and
also
the
beautiful
rhodanes
in
his
grief
he
would
have
stabbed
himself
had
not
the
peasant
girl
who
had
been
the
cause
of
sinonis
jealousy
prevented
him
by
telling
him
who
in
reality
was
buried
there
during
these
adventures
soracchus
had
been
imprisoned
for
allowing
the
lovers
to
escape
and
this
added
to
the
threat
of
further
punishment
induced
him
to
help
the
babylonian
officers
to
trace
rhodanes
so
in
a
short
time
rhodanes
was
prisoner
once
again
and
by
the
command
of
garmus
was
nailed
to
a
cross
in
sight
of
him
the
king
danced
delirious
with
revengeful
joy
and
while
he
was
so
engaged
a
messenger
arrived
with
the
news
that
sinonis
was
about
to
be
espoused
by
the
king
of
syria
into
whose
dominions
she
had
escaped
rhodanes
was
taken
down
from
the
cross
and
put
in
command
of
the
babylonian
army
this
seeming
change
of
fortune
was
really
dictated
by
the
treachery
of
garmus
as
certain
inferior
officers
were
commanded
by
garmus
to
slay
rhodanes
should
he
defeat
the
syrians
and
to
bring
sinonis
alive
to
babylon
rhodanes
won
a
sweeping
victory
and
also
regained
the
affection
and
trust
of
sinonis
the
officers
of
garmus
instead
of
obeying
his
command
proclaimed
the
victor
king
and
all
ended
auspiciously
for
the
lovers
cuneiform
writing
the
manner
in
which
the
ancient
cuneiform
writing
of
babylonia
and
assyria
was
deciphered
and
restored
to
the
world
of
science
and
letters
may
be
regarded
as
a
great
triumph
of
human
reason
the
name
is
most
appropriate
for
each
character
or
sign
is
composed
of
a
wedge
or
combination
of
wedges
it
is
written
as
most
oriental
languages
from
left
to
right
the
cuneiform
script
was
first
noticed
by
a
european
at
such
a
relatively
early
period
as
the
year
when
josaphat
barbaro
a
venetian
traveller
observed
it
cut
on
the
platform
of
rachmet
in
persia
another
italian
pietro
della
valle
passing
that
way
in
copied
a
few
of
the
signs
which
he
sent
back
to
italy
and
sir
john
chardin
accurately
reproduced
an
inscription
found
at
persepolis
in
it
was
obvious
that
three
separate
languages
were
written
in
this
script
and
these
have
since
been
found
to
be
persian
babylonian
and
susian
in
niebuhr
visited
persepolis
and
in
less
than
a
month
copied
all
the
texts
there
which
were
then
ready
for
decipherment
returning
to
denmark
he
occupied
himself
with
studying
what
he
had
set
down
at
persepolis
and
divided
the
smaller
inscriptions
into
three
classes
which
he
described
as
classes
i
ii
and
iii
instead
of
into
three
languages
discovering
that
class
i
embraced
only
signs
he
set
these
in
order
and
but
little
subsequent
addition
has
had
to
be
made
to
them
deciding
that
the
language
of
the
signs
was
written
in
alphabetic
characters
he
found
himself
obliged
to
call
a
halt
but
two
other
scholars
were
more
fortunate
than
he
tychsen
hit
upon
a
certain
diagonal
sign
as
that
employed
to
separate
words
and
correctly
identified
the
alphabetic
signs
for
and
hunter
of
copenhagen
was
more
careful
to
verify
his
historical
data
than
tychsen
had
been
and
was
able
to
identify
distinctly
the
authors
of
the
inscriptions
before
him
he
too
independently
identified
the
oblique
wedge
as
a
separative
of
words
and
hit
upon
the
significance
of
the
sign
for
the
letter
but
after
these
achievements
it
seemed
as
if
little
more
could
be
done
it
must
be
remembered
that
up
to
this
time
no
such
assistance
was
vouchsafed
the
searchers
as
in
the
case
of
the
egyptian
hieroglyphs
where
a
greek
inscription
had
been
found
side
by
side
with
an
egyptian
one
grotefend
but
a
man
of
the
greatest
natural
ingenuity
was
resolved
to
combat
the
difficulty
presented
by
the
cuneiform
script
georg
grotefend
took
up
the
task
in
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
beginning
with
the
assumption
that
the
inscriptions
represented
three
languages
and
that
one
of
these
was
ancient
persian
he
took
two
of
the
inscriptions
which
he
understood
to
be
persian
and
placing
them
side
by
side
found
that
certain
signs
were
of
frequent
recurrence
this
indicated
to
him
the
possibility
that
their
contents
were
similar
a
certain
word
appeared
very
frequently
in
the
inscriptions
but
it
seemed
to
have
two
forms
a
longer
and
a
shorter
and
this
grotefend
adopting
a
suggestion
of
hunter
took
to
mean
in
the
short
form
and
in
the
longer
the
juxtaposition
of
the
two
signs
thus
being
taken
to
signify
of
kings
in
both
the
inscriptions
studied
by
grotefend
he
found
that
this
expression
of
was
followed
by
the
same
word
which
he
took
to
mean
but
there
were
no
definite
facts
to
support
these
hypotheses
turning
to
certain
sassanian
inscriptions
which
had
recently
been
deciphered
he
found
that
the
expression
king
king
of
kings
inevitably
occurred
and
this
strengthened
his
opinion
that
it
was
present
in
the
inscriptions
he
studied
if
this
was
so
thought
he
the
two
texts
under
his
observation
must
have
been
set
up
by
two
different
kings
for
the
names
were
not
the
same
at
the
beginning
moreover
the
name
with
which
text
no
i
began
appears
in
the
third
line
of
text
no
ii
following
the
word
supposed
to
be
and
another
which
might
mean
grotefend
thus
concluded
that
in
the
two
inscriptions
he
had
the
names
of
a
triad
of
rulers
son
father
and
grandfather
applying
to
the
list
of
the
achænenian
dynasty
in
the
attempt
to
find
three
names
which
would
suit
the
conditions
he
selected
those
of
xerxes
darius
and
hystaspes
supposing
the
name
at
the
beginning
of
inscription
i
to
be
darius
he
thus
considered
himself
to
be
justified
in
translating
text
i
as
darius
great
king
king
of
kings
son
of
hystaspes
and
text
ii
as
xerxes
great
king
king
of
kings
son
of
darius
considering
that
the
persian
spelling
of
darius
would
be
darheush
he
applied
the
letters
of
that
name
to
the
letters
of
the
cuneiform
script
subsequent
investigation
has
shown
that
the
name
should
have
been
read
daryavush
but
grotefend
at
least
succeeded
in
discovering
the
letters
for
and
but
this
was
practically
the
end
of
grotefend
discoveries
burnouf
by
a
careful
study
of
persian
geographical
names
managed
to
decipher
a
large
number
of
the
characters
of
the
persian
alphabet
and
professor
lassen
of
bonn
by
similar
means
achieved
a
like
end
these
two
independent
achievements
raised
a
fierce
controversy
as
to
priority
of
discovery
but
lassen
system
was
the
more
perfect
as
he
found
out
that
the
ancient
persian
signs
were
not
entirely
alphabetic
but
were
partially
syllabic
that
is
that
certain
signs
represented
syllables
instead
of
letters
this
meant
that
grotefend
system
which
had
been
almost
vowelless
was
now
to
a
great
extent
filled
in
with
the
necessary
vowels
rawlinson
at
this
juncture
a
certain
major
henry
rawlinson
a
servant
of
the
east
india
company
with
a
good
knowledge
of
persian
went
to
persia
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
to
organize
the
native
army
there
he
was
far
away
from
books
and
when
he
began
to
copy
certain
cuneiform
texts
it
was
because
of
deep
personal
interest
he
was
quite
unaware
of
the
strenuous
toil
which
had
been
lavished
upon
them
in
europe
and
worked
quite
independently
of
all
assistance
the
strange
thing
is
that
he
laboured
almost
on
the
same
lines
as
grotefend
had
done
he
saw
almost
at
once
that
he
had
three
languages
to
deal
with
and
being
a
man
of
great
natural
gifts
he
soon
grouped
the
signs
in
a
correct
manner
strangely
enough
he
applied
the
very
same
names
those
of
hystaspes
darius
and
xerxes
to
the
texts
as
grotefend
had
done
and
found
them
answer
in
the
same
manner
turning
his
attention
to
the
inscription
of
darius
at
behistun
high
up
in
the
face
of
the
living
wall
of
rock
there
rawlinson
succeeded
in
copying
part
of
it
at
great
personal
risk
in
he
forwarded
his
translation
of
the
first
two
paragraphs
of
the
persian
text
containing
the
genealogy
of
darius
to
the
royal
asiatic
society
of
london
the
feat
made
a
tremendous
sensation
and
he
was
supplied
with
all
the
principal
works
on
the
subject
and
much
correspondence
from
european
scholars
he
was
however
patience
personified
and
would
not
publish
a
work
he
had
written
on
the
subject
because
he
thought
it
better
to
wait
until
he
had
verified
his
conclusions
and
perhaps
made
fresh
discoveries
but
in
he
was
despatched
to
afghanistan
on
a
political
mission
and
did
not
return
to
bagdad
for
three
years
and
it
was
not
until
that
he
published
a
series
of
memoirs
in
the
of
the
royal
asiatic
society
in
which
he
gave
to
the
world
a
translation
of
the
persian
text
at
behistun
it
was
a
marvellous
achievement
for
unlike
those
who
had
been
labouring
on
the
subject
in
europe
he
was
ignorant
of
the
languages
allied
to
persian
yet
he
had
surpassed
all
other
scholars
in
his
results
but
the
deciphering
of
the
second
and
third
languages
had
yet
to
be
attacked
in
westergaard
working
on
the
lines
of
grotefend
attacked
the
second
language
he
selected
the
names
of
darius
hystaspes
and
xerxes
and
compared
them
with
their
equivalents
in
the
persian
texts
by
this
means
he
discovered
a
number
of
signs
and
by
their
aid
attempted
to
spell
out
the
syllables
or
words
judging
the
writing
to
be
partly
alphabetic
and
partly
syllabic
he
gave
the
name
median

the
language
morris
who
had
rawlinson
copy
of
the
second
transcription
of
the
behistun
text
to
work
upon

nearly
all
of
it
shortly
after
this
the
language
was
named

the
deciphering
of
the
third
of
the
three
languages
found
at
persepolis
was
attacked
by
löwenstern
and
by
the
rev
edward
hinks
an
irish
clergyman
this
language
was
assyrian
purely
hinks
was
fearful
of
making
blunders
and
whilst
he
was
engaged
in
assuring
himself
that
every
step
he
took
was
not
a
false
one
longpérier
published
in
a
translation
of
the
entire
text
he
was
only
able
to
read
it
by
analogy
with
the
other
texts
he
could
not
provide
the
forms
of
the
assyrian
words
themselves
but
rawlinson
once
more
came
to
the
aid
of
the
study
and
it
was
shown
that
a
large
number
of
signs
were
ideographic
this
paved
the
way
for
a
band
of
others
who
by
their
united
efforts
succeeded
in
unravelling
the
complicated
script
origin
of
cuneiform
this
peculiar
system
of
writing
originated
in
babylonia
its
inventors
being
the
sumerian
or
people
who
inhabited
that
country
before
its
settlement
by
the
babylonians
it
was
developed
from
and
indeed
some
of
the
more
highly
significant
of
the
pictorial
signs
can
still
be
faintly
traced
in
their
cuneiform
equivalents
this
early
was
inscribed
on
stone
but
eventually
soft
clay
was
adopted
as
a
medium
for
the
script
and
it
was
found
that
straight
lines
impressed
upon
this
medium
tended
to
the
shape
of
a
wedge
the
pictures
therefore
lost
their
original
character
and
came
to
be
mere
conventional
groups
of
wedges
the
plural
was
represented
by
doubling
the
sign
and
a
term
might
be
intensified
by
the
addition
of
a
certain
stroke
thus
the
sign
for
if
four
small
strokes
were
added
to
it
would
mean
house
and
so
forth
the
script
was
badly
suited
to
the
assyrian
language
as
it
had
not
been
originally
designed
for
a
semitic
tongue
it
consists
of
simple
syllables
made
up
of
a
vowel
by
itself
or
a
vowel
and
a
consonant
ideograms
or
signs
which
express
an
entire
word
and
closed
syllables
such
as
or
again
many
of
the
signs
have
more
than
one
syllabic
value
and
they
may
be
used
as
ideograms
as
well
as
phonetically
as
in
the
egyptian
script
determinatives
are
employed
to
indicate
the
class
to
which
the
word
belongs
thus
a
certain
sign
is
placed
before
the
names
of
persons
another
before
territorial
names
and
a
third
before
the
names
of
gods
and
sacred
beings
the
date
of
the
epoch
in
which
this
writing
first
began
to
be
used
was
probably
about
and
it
persisted
until
the
first
century
the
assyrians
employed
it
from
about
until
about
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
this
ancient
form
of
writing
was
thus
used
first
by
the
sumerians
then
by
their
babylonian
and
assyrian
conquerors
then
by
those
persians
who
finally
overthrew
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
empire
the
sacred
literature
of
babylonia
the
literature
which
this
peculiar
and
individual
script
has
brought
down
to
us
is
chiefly
religious
magical
epical
and
legendary
the
last
three
categories
are
dealt
with
elsewhere
so
that
it
only
falls
here
to
consider
the
first
class
the
religious
writings
these
are
usually
composed
in
semitic
babylonian
without
any
trace
of
akkadian
influence
and
it
can
not
be
said
that
they
display
any
especial
natural
eloquence
or
literary
distinction
in
an
address
to
the
which
begins
nobly
enough
with
a
high
apostrophe
to
the
golden
luminary
of
day
we
find
ourselves
descending
gradually
into
an
atmosphere
of
almost
ludicrous
dullness
the
person
praying
desires
the
to
free
him
from
the
commonplace
cares
of
family
and
domestic
annoyances
enumerating
spells
against
all
of
his
relatives
in
order
that
they
may
not
place
their
upon
him
in
another
written
in
akkadian
the
penitent
addresses
gubarra
merodach
and
other
gods
desiring
that
they
direct
their
eyes
kindly
upon
him
and
that
his
supplication
may
reach
them
strangely
enough
the
prayer
fervently
pleads
that
its
utterance
may
good
to
the
gods
that
it
may
let
their
hearts
rest
their
livers
be
quieted
and
gladden
them
like
a
father
and
a
mother
who
have
begotten
children
this
is
not
so
strange
when
we
come
to
consider
the
nature
of
these
hymns
many
of
which
come
perilously
near
the
of
pure
magic
that
is
they
closely
resemble
spells
we
find
too
that
those
which
invoke
the
older
deities
such
as
gibi
the
are
more
magical
in
their
trend
than
those
addressed
to
the
later
gods
when
a
higher
sense
of
religious
feeling
had
probably
been
evolved
indeed
it
does
not
seem
too
much
to
say
that
some
of
these
early
hymns
may
have
served
the
purpose
of
later
incantations
most
of
those
hymns
appear
to
have
emanated
from
that
extremely
ancient
seat
of
religion
eridu
and
are
probably
relics
of
the
time
when
as
yet
magic
and
religion
were
scarcely
differentiated
in
the
priestly
or
the
popular
mind
hymn
to
adar
a
fine
hymn
to
adar
describes
the
rumbling
of
the
storm
in
the
abyss

of
the

terror
of
the
splendour
of

many
of
the
hymns
assist
us
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
precise
nature
of
the
gods
defining
as
they
do
their
duties
and
offices
and
even
occasionally
describing
their
appearance
thus
in
a
hymn
to
nebo
we
note
that
he
is
alluded
to
as
the
supreme
messenger
who
binds
all
things
together

corn
and
the
god
without
whom
the
irrigated

and
the
canal
are
unwatered
it
is
from
such
texts
that
the
mythologist
is
enabled
to
piece
together
the
true
significance
of
many
of
the
deities
of
ancient
peoples
a
hymn
to

his
character

is
alluded

forceful
the
exalter

and

enlightener

such
descriptive
hymns
are
the

valuable
assets
possible

of

babylonian
cosmogony
the
babylonian
myth
of
creation
few
creation
myths
are
more
replete
with
interest
than
those
which
have
literary
sanction
these
are
few
in
number
as
for
example
the
creation
story
in
genesis
those
to
be
found
in
egyptian
papyri
and
that
contained
in
the
of
the
maya
of
central
america
in
such
an
account
we
can
trace
the
creation
story
from
the
first
dim
conception
of
to
the
polished
and
final
effort
of
a
priestly
caste
to
give
a
theological
interpretation
to
the
intentions
of
the
creative
deity
and
this
is
perhaps
more
the
case
with
the
creation
myth
which
had
its
rise
among
the
old
akkadian
population
of
babylonia
than
with
any
other
known
to
mythic
science
in
the
account
in
genesis
of
the
framing
of
the
world
it
has
been
discovered
that
two
different
versions
have
been
fused
to
form
a
single
story
the
creation
tale
of
the
is
certainly
a
composite
myth
and
similar
suspicions
may
rest
upon
the
analogous
myths
of
scandinavia
and
japan
but
in
the
case
of
babylonia
we
may
be
convinced
that
no
other
influences
except
those
of
the
races
who
inhabited
babylonian
territory
could
have
been
brought
to
bear
upon
this
ancient
story
and
that
although
critical
examination
has
proved
it
to
consist
of
materials
which
have
been
drawn
from
more
than
one
source
yet
these
sources
are
not
foreign
and
they
have
not
undergone
sophistication
at
the
hands
of
any
alien
mythographer
or
interpolator
illustration
the
seven
tablets
of
photo
mansell
and
it
would
seem
that
this
babylonian
cosmogony
was
drawn
from
various
sources
but
it
appears
to
be
contained
in
its
final
form
in
what
are
known
as
the
seven
tablets
of
creation
brought
from
the
library
of
at
nineveh
and
now
in
the
british
museum
these
have
from
time
to
time
been
supplemented
by
later
finds
but
we
may
take
it
that
in
this
record
we
have
the
final
official
development
of
babylonian
belief
due
to
the
priests
of
babylon
after
that
city
had
become
the
metropolis
of
the
empire
the
primary
object
of
the
seven
tablets
was
to
record
a
terrific
fight
between
bel
and
the
dragon
and
the
account
of
the
creation
is
inserted
by
way
of
introduction
it
is
undoubtedly
the
most
important
find
dealing
with
babylonian
religion
that
has
as
yet
come
to
light
before
we
advance
any
critical
speculations
respecting
it
let
us
set
forth
the
story
which
it
has
to
tell
as
in
so
many
creation
myths
we
find
chaotic
darkness
brooding
over
a
waste
of
waters
heaven
and
earth
were
not
as
yet
naught
existed
save
the
primeval
ocean
mommu
tiawath
from
whose
fertile
depths
came
every
living
thing
nor
were
the
waters
distributed
as
in
the
days
of
man
into
sea
river
or
lake
but
all
were
confined
together
in
one
vast
and
bottomless
abyss
neither
did
god
or
man
exist
their
names
were
unknown
and
their
destinies
undetermined
the
future
was
as
dark
as
the
gloom
which
lay
over
the
mighty
gulf
of
chaos
nothing
had
been
designed
or
debated
concerning
it
the
birth
of
the
gods
but
there
came
a
stirring
in
the
darkness
and
the
great
gods
arose
first
came
lahmu
and
lahame
and
many
epochs
later
ansar
and
kisar
component
parts
of
whose
names
signify
of
heaven
and
of
earth
these
latter
names
we
may
perhaps
accept
as
symbolical
of
the
spirits
of
heaven
and
of
earth
respectively
many
days
afterward
came
forth
their
son
anu
god
of
the
heavens
at
this
point
it
should
be
explained
that
the
name
tiawath
affords
a
parallel
to
the
expression
or
of
the
old
testament
practically
the
same
word
is
used
in
assyrian
in
the
form
to
signify
the
sea
the
reader
will
recall
that
it
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
that
the
spirit
of
god
brooded
according
to
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
the
word
and
the
idea
which
it
contains
are
equally
semitic
but
strangely
enough
it
has
an
akkadian
origin
for
the
conception
that
the
watery
abyss
was
the
source
of
all
things
originated
with
the
worshippers
of
the
ea
at
eridu
they
termed
the
deep
or
a
of
knowledge
wherein
their
tutelar
god
was
supposed
to
have
his
dwelling
and
this
word
was
of
akkadian
descent
this
or
in
virtue
of
the
animistic
ideas
prevailing
in
early
akkadian
times
had
become
personalized
as
a
female
who
was
regarded
as
the
mother
of
ea
she
was
known
by
another
name
as
well
as
that
of
apsu
for
she
was
also
entitled
zigarun
the
or
the
that
has
begotten
heaven
and
earth
and
indeed
she
seems
to
have
had
a
form
or
variant
in
which
she
was
an
as
well
but
it
was
not
the
existing
earth
or
heaven
that
she
represented
in
either
of
her
forms
but
the
primeval
abyss
out
of
which
both
of
these
were
fashioned
at
this
point
the
narrative
exhibits
numerous
defects
and
for
a
continuation
of
it
we
must
apply
to
damascius
the
last
of
the
neoplatonists
who
was
born
in
damascus
about
and
who
is
regarded
by
most
assyriologists
as
having
had
access
to
valuable
written
or
traditional
material
he
was
the
author
of
a
work
entitled
and
solutions
of
the
first
in
which
he
states
that
anu
was
followed
by
bel
we
retain
the
babylonian
form
of
the
names
rather
than
damascius
greek
titles
and
ea
the
god
of
eridu
from
ea
and
dawkina
he
writes
was
born
a
son
called
belos
or
whom
the
babylonians
regarded
as
the
creator
of
the
world
from
damascius
we
can
learn
nothing
further
and
the
defective
character
of
the
tablet
does
not
permit
us
to
proceed
with
any
degree
of
certainty
until
we
arrive
at
the
name
of
nudimmud
which
appears
to
be
simply
a
variant
of
the
name
of
ea
from
obscure
passages
it
may
be
generally
gleaned
that
tiawath
and
apsu
once
one
or
rather
originally
representing
the
babylonian
and
akkadian
forms
of
the
deep
are
now
regarded
as
mates
tiawath
being
the
female
and
apsu
once
female
in
this
case
the
male
these
have
a
son
moumis
or
mummu
a
name
which
at
one
time
seems
to
have
been
given
to
tiawath
so
that
in
these
changes
we
may
be
able
to
trace
the
hand
of
the
later
mythographer
who
with
less
skill
and
greater
levity
than
is
to
be
found
in
most
myths
has
taken
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
manufacturing
three
deities
out
of
one
it
may
be
that
the
scribe
in
question
was
well
aware
that
his
literary
effort
must
square
with
and
placate
popular
belief
or
popular
prejudice
and
in
no
era
and
at
no
time
has
priestly
ingenuity
been
unequal
to
such
a
task
as
is
well
evidenced
by
many
myths
which
exhibit
traces
of
late
alteration
but
in
dwelling
for
a
moment
on
this
question
it
is
only
just
to
the
priesthood
to
admit
that
such
changes
did
not
always
emanate
from
them
but
were
the
work
of
poets
and
philosophers
who
for
æsthetic
or
rational
reasons
took
it
upon
themselves
to
recast
the
myths
of
their
race
according
to
the
dictates
of
a
nicer
taste
or
in
the
interests
of
a
darksome
trinity
these
three
then
tiawath
apsu
and
mummu
appear
to
have
formed
a
trinity
which
bore
no
to
the
gods
they
themselves
as
deities
of
a
primeval
epoch
were
doubtless
regarded
by
the
theological
opinion
of
a
later
day
as
dark
dubious
and
unsatisfactory
it
is
notorious
that
in
many
lands
the
early
elemental
gods
came
into
bad
odour
in
later
times
and
it
may
be
that
the
akkadian
descent
of
this
trio
did
not
conduce
to
their
popularity
with
the
babylonian
people
be
that
as
it
may
alien
and
aboriginal
gods
have
in
all
times
been
looked
upon
by
an
invading
and
conquering
race
with
distrust
as
the
workers
of
magic
and
the
sowers
of
evil
and
even
although
a
babylonian
name
had
been
accorded
one
of
them
it
may
not
have
been
employed
in
a
complimentary
sense
whereas
the
high
gods
regarded
those
of
the
abyss
with
distrust
the
darker
deities
of
chaos
took
up
an
attitude
towards
the
divinities
of
light
which
can
only
be
compared
to
the
sarcastic
tone
which
milton
satan
adopts
against
the
power
which
thrust
him
into
outer
darkness
apsu
was
the
most
ironical
of
all
there
was
no
peace
for
him
he
declared
so
long
as
the
dwelt
on
high
their
way
was
not
his
way
neither
was
it
that
of
tiawath
who
if
apsu
represented
sarcasm
deified
exhibited
a
fierce
truculence
much
more
overpowering
than
the
irony
of
her
mate
the
trio
discussed
how
they
might
rid
themselves
of
those
beings
who
desired
a
reign
of
light
and
happiness
and
in
these
deliberations
mummu
the
son
was
the
prime
mover
here
again
the
tablets
fails
us
somewhat
but
we
learn
sufficient
further
on
to
assure
us
that
project
was
one
of
open
war
against
the
gods
of
heaven
in
connexion
with
this
campaign
tiawath
made
the
most
elaborate
preparations
along
with
her
companions
she
laboured
without
ceasing
from
the
waters
of
the
great
abyss
over
which
she
presided
she
called
forth
the
most
fearful
monsters
who
remind
us
strongly
of
those
against
which
horus
the
egyptian
god
of
light
had
to
strive
in
his
wars
with
set
from
the
deep
came
gigantic
serpents
armed
with
stings
dripping
with
the
most
deadly
poison
dragons
of
vast
shape
reared
their
heads
above
the
flood
their
huge
jaws
armed
with
row
upon
row
of
formidable
teeth
giant
dogs
of
indescribable
savagery
men
fashioned
partly
like
scorpions
and
countless
other
horrible
beings
were
created
and
formed
into
battalions
under
the
command
of
a
god
named
kingu
to
whom
tiawath
referred
as
her
husband
and
to
whom
she
promised
the
rule
of
heaven
and
of
fate
when
once
the
detested
gods
of
light
are
removed
by
his
mighty
arm
the
introduction
of
this
being
as
the
husband
of
tiawath
seems
to
point
either
to
a
fusion
of
legends
or
to
the
interpolation
of
some
passage
popular
in
babylonian
lore
at
this
juncture
apsu
disappears
as
does
mummu
can
it
be
that
at
this
point
a
scribe
or
mythographer
took
up
the
tale
who
did
not
agree
with
his
predecessor
in
describing
tiawath
apsu
and
mummu
originally
one
as
three
separate
deities
this
would
explain
the
divergence
but
the
point
is
an
obscure
one
and
hasty
conclusions
on
slight
evidence
are
usually
doomed
to
failure
to
resume
our
narrative
tiawath
whoever
her
coadjutors
was
resolved
to
retain
in
her
own
hands
the
source
of
all
living
things
that
great
deep
over
which
she
presided
but
the
gods
of
heaven
were
by
no
means
lulled
into
peaceful
security
for
they
were
aware
of
the
which
tiawath
bore
them
they
learned
of
her
plot
and
great
was
their
wrath
ea
the
god
of
water
was
the
first
to
hear
of
it
and
related
it
to
ansar
his
father
who
filled
heaven
with
his
cries
of
anger
ansar
betook
himself
to
his
other
son
anu
god
of
the
sky
speak
to
the
great
dragon
he
urged
him
speak
to
her
my
son
and
her
anger
will
be
assuaged
and
her
wrath
vanish
duly
obedient
anu
betook
himself
to
the
realm
of
tiawath
to
reason
with
her
but
the
monster
snarled
at
him
so
fiercely
that
in
dread
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
and
departed
next
came
nudimmud
to
her
but
with
no
better
success
at
length
the
gods
decided
that
one
of
their
number
called
merodach
should
undertake
the
task
of
combating
tiawath
the
terrible
merodach
asked
that
it
might
be
written
that
he
should
be
victorious
and
this
was
granted
him
he
was
then
given
rule
over
the
entire
universe
and
to
test
whether
or
not
the
greatest
power
had
passed
to
him
a
garment
was
placed
in
the
midst
of
the
gods
and
merodach
spoke
words
commanding
that
it
should
disappear
straightway
it
vanished
and
was
not
once
more
spake
the
god
and
the
garment
before
the
eyes
of
the
dwellers
in
heaven
the
portion
of
the
epic
which
describes
the
newly
acquired
glories
of
merodach
is
exceedingly
eloquent
we
are
told
that
none
among
the
gods
can
now
surpass
him
in
power
that
the
place
of
their
gathering
has
become
his
home
that
they
have
given
him
the
supreme
sovereignty
and
they
even
beg
that
to
them
who
put
their
trust
in
him
he
will
be
gracious
they
pray
that
he
may
pour
out
the
soul
of
the
keeper
of
evil
and
finally
they
place
in
his
hands
a
marvellous
weapon
with
which
to
cut
off
the
life
of
tiawath
let
the
winds
carry
her
blood
to
secret
places
they
exclaimed
in
their
desire
that
the
waters
of
this
fountain
of
wickedness
should
be
scattered
far
and
wide
mighty
was
he
to
look
upon
when
he
set
forth
for
the
combat
his
great
bow
he
bore
upon
his
back
he
swung
his
massive
club
triumphantly
he
set
the
lightning
before
him
he
filled
his
body
with
swiftness
and
he
framed
a
great
net
to
enclose
the
dragon
of
the
sea
then
with
a
word
he
created
terrible
winds
and
tempests
whirlwinds
storms
seven
in
all
for
the
confounding
of
tiawath
the
hurricane
was
his
weapon
and
he
rode
in
the
chariot
of
destiny
his
helm
blazed
with
terror
and
awful
was
his
aspect
the
steeds
which
were
yoked
to
his
chariot
rushed
rapidly
towards
the
abyss
their
mouths
frothing
with
venomous
foam
followed
by
all
the
good
wishes
of
the
gods
merodach
fared
forth
that
day
illustration
mighty
was
he
to
look
upon
evelyn
paul
soon
he
came
to
tiawath
retreat
but
at
sight
of
the
monster
he
halted
and
with
reason
for
there
crouched
the
great
dragon
her
scaly
body
still
gleaming
with
the
waters
of
the
abyss
flame
darting
from
her
eyes
and
nostrils
and
such
terrific
sounds
issuing
from
her
widely
open
mouth
as
would
have
terrified
any
but
the
bravest
of
the
gods
merodach
reproached
tiawath
for
her
rebellion
and
ended
by
challenging
her
to
combat
like
the
dragons
of
all
time
tiawath
appears
to
have
been
versed
in
magic
and
hurled
the
most
potent
incantations
against
her
adversary
she
cast
many
a
spell
but
merodach
unawed
by
this
threw
over
her
his
great
net
and
caused
an
evil
wind
which
he
had
sent
on
before
him
to
blow
on
her
so
that
she
might
not
close
her
mouth
the
tempest
rushed
between
her
jaws
and
held
them
open
it
entered
her
body
and
racked
her
frame
merodach
swung
his
club
on
high
and
with
a
mighty
blow
shattered
her
great
flank
and
slew
her
down
he
cast
her
corpse
and
stood
upon
it
then
he
cut
out
her
evil
heart
finally
he
overthrew
the
host
of
monsters
which
had
followed
her
so
that
at
length
they
trembled
turned
and
fled
in
headlong
rout
these
also
he
caught
in
his
net
and
kept
them
in
bondage
kingu
he
bound
and
took
from
him
the
tablets
of
destiny
which
had
been
granted
to
him
by
the
slain
tiawath
which
obviously
means
that
the
god
of
a
later
generation
wrenches
the
power
of
fate
from
an
earlier
hierarchy
just
as
one
earthly
dynasty
may
overthrow
and
replace
another
the
north
wind
bore
tiawath
blood
away
to
secret
places
and
at
the
sight
ea
sitting
high
in
the
heavens
rejoiced
exceedingly
then
merodach
took
rest
and
nourishment
and
as
he
rested
a
plan
arose
in
his
mind
rising
he
flayed
tiawath
of
her
scaly
skin
and
cut
her
asunder
we
have
already
seen
that
the
north
wind
bore
her
blood
away
which
probably
symbolises
the
distribution
of
rivers
over
the
earth
then
did
merodach
take
the
two
parts
of
her
vast
body
and
with
one
of
them
he
framed
a
covering
for
the
heavens
merodach
next
divided
the
upper
from
the
lower
waters
made
dwellings
for
the
gods
set
lights
in
the
heaven
and
ordained
their
regular
courses
as
the
tablet
poetically
puts
it
he
lit
up
the
sky
establishing
the
upper
firmament
and
caused
anu
bel
and
ea
to
inhabit
it
he
then
founded
the
constellations
as
stations
for
the
great
gods
and
instituted
the
year
setting
three
constellations
for
each
month
and
placing
his
own
star
nibiru
as
the
chief
light
in
the
firmament
then
he
caused
the
new
moon
nannaru
to
shine
forth
and
gave
him
the
rulership
of
the
night
granting
him
a
day
of
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
month
there
is
another
mutilation
at
this
point
and
we
gather
that
the
net
of
merodach
with
which
he
had
snared
tiawath
was
placed
in
the
heavens
as
a
constellation
along
with
his
bow
the
winds
also
appear
to
have
been
bound
or
tamed
and
placed
in
the
several
points
of
the
compass
but
the
whole
passage
is
very
obscure
and
doubtless
information
of
surpassing
interest
has
been
lost
through
the
mutilation
of
the
tablet
we
shall
probably
not
be
far
in
error
if
we
regard
the
myth
of
the
combat
between
merodach
and
tiawath
as
an
explanation
of
the
primal
strife
between
light
and
darkness
among
the
most
primitive
peoples
the
solar
hero
has
at
one
stage
of
his
career
to
encounter
a
grisly
dragon
or
serpent
who
threatens
his
very
existence
in
many
cases
this
monster
guards
a
treasure
which
mythologists
of
a
generation
ago
almost
invariably
explained
as
that
gold
which
is
spread
over
the
sky
at
the
hour
of
sunset
the
assigning
of
solar
characteristics
to
all
slayers
of
dragons
and
their
kind
was
a
weakness
of
the
older
school
of
mythology
akin
to
its
deductions
based
on
philological
grounds
but
such
criticism
as
has
been
directed
against
the
solar
theory
and
it
has
been
extensive
has
not
always
been
pertinent
and
in
many
cases
has
been
merely
futile
in
fact
the
solar
theory
suffered
because
of
the
philological
arguments
with
which
it
was
bound
up
and
neither
critics
nor
readers
appeared
to
discriminate
between
these
but
we
should
constantly
bear
in
mind
that
to
attempt
to
elucidate
or
explain
myths
by
any
one
system
or
by
one
hard
and
fast
hypothesis
is
futile
on
the
other
hand
nearly
all
systems
which
have
yet
attempted
to
elucidate
or
disentangle
the
terms
of
myth
are
capable
of
application
to
certain
types
of
myth
the
dragon
story
is
all
but
universal
in
china
it
is
the
monster
which
temporarily
swallows
the
sun
during
eclipse
in
egypt
it
was
the
great
serpent
apep
which
battled
with
ra
and
horus
both
solar
heroes
in
india
it
is
the
serpent
vritra
or
ahi
who
is
vanquished
by
indra
in
australia
and
in
some
parts
of
north
america
a
great
frog
takes
the
place
of
the
dragon
in
the
story
of
beowulf
the
last
exploit
of
the
hero
is
the
slaying
of
a
terrible
dragon
which
guards
a
hidden
and
beowulf
receives
a
mortal
wound
in
the
encounter
in
the
volsung
saga
the
covetous
faffnir
is
turned
into
a
dragon
and
is
slain
by
sigurd
these
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
monsters
which
cause
drought
and
pestilence
it
is
a
monster
with
which
we
have
here
to
deal
illustration
conflict
between
merodach
and
photo
mansell
and
the
tablets
here
allude
to
the
creation
of
man
the
gods
it
is
stated
so
admired
the
handiwork
of
merodach
that
they
desired
to
see
him
execute
still
further
marvels
now
the
gods
had
none
to
worship
them
or
pay
them
homage
and
merodach
suggested
to
his
father
ea
the
creation
of
man
out
of
his
divine
blood
here
once
more
the
tablets
fail
us
and
we
must
turn
to
the
narrative
of
the
chaldean
writer
berossus
as
preserved
by
no
less
than
three
authors
of
the
classical
age
berossus
states
that
a
certain
woman
thalatth
that
is
tiawath
had
many
strange
creatures
at
her
bidding
belus
that
is
attacked
and
cut
her
in
twain
forming
the
earth
out
of
one
half
and
the
heavens
out
of
the
other
and
destroying
all
the
creatures
over
which
she
ruled
then
did
merodach
decapitate
himself
and
as
his
blood
flowed
forth
the
other
gods
mingled
it
with
the
earth
and
formed
man
from
it
from
this
circumstance
mankind
is
rational
and
has
a
spark
of
the
divine
in
it
then
did
merodach
divide
the
darkness
separate
the
heavens
from
the
earth
and
order
the
details
of
the
entire
universe
but
those
animals
which
he
had
created
were
not
able
to
bear
the
light
and
died
a
passage
then
occurs
which
states
that
the
stars
the
sun
and
moon
and
the
five
planets
were
created
and
it
would
seem
from
the
repetition
that
there
were
two
creations
that
the
first
was
a
failure
in
which
merodach
had
as
it
were
essayed
a
first
attempt
perfecting
the
process
in
the
second
creation
of
course
it
may
be
conjectured
that
berossus
may
have
drawn
from
two
conflicting
accounts
or
that
those
who
quote
him
have
inserted
the
second
passage
the
sumerian
incantation
which
is
provided
with
a
semitic
translation
adds
somewhat
to
our
knowledge
of
this
cosmogony
it
states
that
in
the
beginning
nothing
as
yet
existed
none
of
the
great
cities
of
babylonia
had
yet
been
built
indeed
there
was
no
land
nothing
but
sea
it
was
not
until
the
veins
of
tiawath
had
been
cut
through
that
paradise
and
the
abyss
appear
to
have
been
separated
and
the
gods
created
by
merodach
also
did
he
create
or
gods
of
the
earth
and
established
a
wondrous
city
as
a
place
in
which
they
might
dwell
then
men
were
formed
with
the
aid
of
the
goddess
aruru
and
finally
vegetation
trees
and
animals
then
did
merodach
raise
the
great
temples
of
erech
and
nippur
from
this
account
we
see
that
instead
of
merodach
being
alluded
to
as
the
son
of
the
gods
he
is
regarded
as
their
creator
in
the
library
of
nineveh
was
also
discovered
a
copy
of
a
tablet
written
for
the
great
temple
of
nergal
at
cuthah
nergal
himself
is
supposed
to
make
the
statement
which
it
contains
he
tells
us
how
the
hosts
of
chaos
and
confusion
came
into
being
at
first
as
in
the
other
accounts
nothingness
reigned
supreme
then
did
the
great
gods
create
warriors
with
the
bodies
of
birds
and
men
with
the
faces
of
ravens
they
founded
them
a
city
in
the
ground
and
tiawath
the
great
dragon
did
suckle
them
they
were
fostered
in
the
midst
of
the
mountains
and
under
the
care
of
the
of
the
gods
they
greatly
increased
and
became
heroes
of
might
seven
kings
had
they
who
ruled
over
six
thousand
people
their
father
was
the
god
benani
and
their
mother
the
queen
melili
these
beings
who
might
almost
be
called
tame
gods
of
evil
nergal
states
that
he
destroyed
thus
all
accounts
agree
concerning
the
original
chaotic
condition
of
the
universe
they
also
agree
that
the
powers
of
chaos
and
darkness
were
destroyed
by
a
god
of
light
the
creation
tablets
are
written
in
semitic
and
allude
to
the
great
circle
of
the
gods
as
already
fully
developed
and
having
its
full
complement
even
the
later
deities
are
mentioned
in
them
this
means
that
it
must
be
assigned
to
a
comparatively
late
date
but
it
possesses
elements
which
go
to
show
that
it
is
a
late
edition
of
a
much
earlier
composition
indeed
the
fundamental
elements
in
it
appear
as
has
been
said
to
be
purely
akkadian
in
origin
and
that
would
throw
back
the
date
of
its
original
form
to
a
very
primitive
period
indeed
it
has
as
will
readily
be
seen
a
very
involved
cosmogony
its
characteristics
show
it
to
have
been
originally
local
and
of
course
babylonian
in
its
secondary
origin
but
from
time
to
time
it
was
added
to
so
that
such
gods
as
were
at
a
later
date
adopted
into
the
babylonian
pantheon
might
be
explained
and
accounted
for
by
it
but
the
legend
of
the
creation
arising
in
the
city
of
babylon
the
local
known
and
understood
by
the
people
was
never
entirely
shelved
by
the
more
consequential
and
polished
epic
which
was
perhaps
only
known
and
appreciated
in
literary
and
æsthetic
circles
and
bore
the
same
relation
to
the
humbler
that
milton
bears
to
the
medieval
legends
of
the
casting
out
of
satan
from
heaven
although
it
is
quite
easy
to
distinguish
influences
of
extreme
antiquity
in
the
babylonian
creation
myth
it
is
clear
that
in
the
shape
in
which
it
has
come
down
to
us
it
has
been
altered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
merodach
reap
the
entire
credit
of
tiawath
defeat
instead
of
or
the
deity
who
was
his
predecessor
as
monarch
of
the
gods
jastrow
holds
that
the
entire
cosmological
tale
has
been
constructed
from
an
account
of
a
conflict
with
a
primeval
monster
and
a
story
of
a
rebellion
against
ea
that
these
two
tales
have
become
fused
and
that
the
first
is
again
divisible
into
three
versions
originating
one
at
uruk
and
the
other
two
at
nippur
at
different
epochs
the
first
celebrates
the
conquest
of
anu
over
tiawath
the
second
exalts
ninib
as
the
conqueror
and
the
third
replaces
him
by
we
thus
see
how
it
was
possible
for
the
god
of
a
conquering
or
popular
dynasty
to
have
a
complete
myth
made
over
to
him
and
how
at
last
it
was
competent
for
the
mighty
merodach
of
babylon
to
replace
an
entire
line
of
deities
as
the
central
figure
of
a
myth
which
must
have
been
popular
with
untold
generations
of
akkadian
and
babylonian
people
type
of
babylonian
cosmology
we
must
now
consider
the
precise
nature
of
the
babylonian
cosmology
and
its
place
among
other
creation
myths
like
the
cosmological
efforts
of
most
primitive
or
barbarian
peoples
it
does
not
partake
of
the
character
of
a
creation
myth
so
much
as
an
account
of
an
evolution
from
chaos
and
the
establishment
of
physical
laws
the
primitive
mind
can
not
grasp
the
idea
of
the
creation
of
something
out
of
nothing
and
the
babylonians
and
akkadians
did
not
differ
in
this
respect
from
other
races
in
the
same
stage
of
development
in
whatever
direction
we
look
when
examining
the
cosmologies
of
barbarian
or
peoples
we
find
a
total
inability
to
get
behind
and
beyond
the
idea
that
the
matter
of
creation
lay
already
to
the
hand
of
the
creative
agency
and
that
in
order
to
shape
a
world
it
had
but
to
draw
the
material
therefor
from
the
teeming
deep
or
the
slain
body
of
a
hostile
monster
not
only
does
the
idea
of
creating
land
and
water
out
of
nothingness
seem
absurd
to
the
primitive
mind
but
man
as
well
must
be
framed
from
dust
mud
clay
or
the
blood
of
the
creative
god
himself
yet
merodach
was
able
to
bring
a
garment
out
of
nothingness
and
to
return
it
thither
by
merely
speaking
a
word
why
then
did
not
the
theology
which
admitted
the
possibility
of
such
a
phenomenon
carry
out
its
own
conception
to
a
logical
conclusion
and
own
the
likelihood
of
the
god
ability
to
create
an
entire
universe
in
the
manner
perhaps
the
step
was
too
bold
for
an
individual
to
take
in
the
face
of
an
entire
theological
college
and
in
any
case
what
would
seem
a
perfectly
feasible
act
of
magic
to
the
theologians
of
babylon
when
applied
to
a
garment
might
not
serve
for
application
to
the
making
of
the
earth
and
all
that
is
therein
the
cosmology
of
babylon
is
therefore
on
a
par
with
those
of
scandinavia
china
and
many
north
american
indian
tribes
nor
does
it
reach
so
high
an
imaginative
level
as
those
of
ancient
egypt
india
or
the
maya
of
central
america
in
some
of
which
the
vocal
command
of
a
god
is
sufficient
to
bring
about
the
creation
of
the
earth
and
the
waters
surrounding
it
the
making
of
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
other
heavenly
bodies
is
as
will
be
more
fully
shown
later
of
great
importance
in
babylonian
myth
the
stars
appear
to
have
been
attached
to
the
firmament
of
heaven
as
to
a
cloth
across
this
the
sun
passed
daily
his
function
being
to
inspect
the
movements
of
the
other
heavenly
bodies
the
moon
likewise
had
her
fixed
course
and
certain
stars
were
also
supposed
to
move
across
the
picture
of
the
night
with
greater
or
less
regularity
the
heavens
were
guarded
at
either
end
by
a
great
gateway
and
through
one
of
these
the
sun
passed
after
rising
from
the
ocean
whilst
in
setting
he
quitted
the
heavens
by
the
opposite
portal
the
terrestrial
world
was
imagined
as
a
great
hollow
structure
resting
on
the
indeed
it
would
seem
to
have
been
regarded
as
an
island
floating
on
an
abyss
of
waters
this
conception
of
the
world
of
earth
was
by
no
means
peculiar
to
the
babylonians
but
was
shared
by
them
with
many
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
as
emanating
from
the
blood
of
merodach
himself
man
was
looked
upon
as
directly
of
heavenly
origin
an
older
tradition
existed
to
the
effect
that
merodach
had
been
assisted
in
the
creation
of
mankind
by
the
goddess
aruru
who
figures
in
the
gilgamesh
epic
as
the
creatress
of
eabani
out
of
a
piece
of
clay
we
also
find
an
ancient
belief
current
that
humanity
owed
its
origin
to
the
god
ea
but
when
merodach
displaced
this
god
politically
he
would
of
course
over
his
entire
record
and
creative
deeds
as
well
as
his
powers
and
sovereignties
at
nippur
bel
was
looked
up
to
as
the
originator
of
man
but
these
beliefs
probably
obtained
in
remoter
times
and
would
finally
be
quenched
by
the
advance
to
full
and
unquestioned
power
of
the
great
god
merodach
connexion
with
the
jonah
legend
some
mythologists
see
in
the
story
of
jonah
a
hidden
allusion
to
the
circumstances
of
babylonian
cosmology
jonah
as
we
remember
was
summoned
to
nineveh
to
prophesy
against
it
but
proceeding
instead
to
joppa
the
scene
of
the
later
myth
of
perseus
and
andromeda
the
ship
in
which
he
set
sail
was
and
he
himself
advised
the
sailors
to
cast
him
overboard
they
did
so
and
a
great
fish
swallowed
him
this
it
has
been
claimed
is
merely
a
marine
form
of
tiawath
the
dragon
of
chaos
and
the
three
days
and
nights
which
jonah
remains
inside
it
are
the
winter
months
this
does
not
seem
very
clear
hercules
in
like
manner
descended
into
the
belly
of
a
fish
and
emerged
again
after
three
days
according
to
the
ph
oe
nicians
the
name
of
jonah
may
be
compared
with
that
of
oannes
or
ea
the
in
the
hindu
thrown
into
the
sea
is
swallowed
by
a
fish
like
the
ring
of
gyges
was
there
a
local
at
joppa
a
variant
of
tiawath
and
is
it
the
same
in
the
jonah
myth
as
that
in
the
tale
of
perseus
a
tawny
fountain
at
joppa
was
thought
to
derive
its
colour
from
the
blood
of
the
slain
by
perseus
says
pausanias
was
then
the
monster
who
lay
in
wait
off
joppa
tiawath
the
goddess
of
darkness
and
was
jonah
none
other
than
ea
or
oannes
her
mortal
foe
the
god
of
light
whom
she
would
mythologically
swallow
during
the
sere
months
of
winter
another
spelling
is
tiamat
sayce
of
whom
we
now
hear
for
the
first
time
in
many
mythologies
we
find
the
gods
praying
and
sacrificing
to
one
another
and
even
to
deities
presumably
higher
than
themselves
and
unknown
to
man
or
only
guessed
at
by
him
thus
the
vedic
gods
are
constantly
sacrificing
one
to
the
other
and
there
are
many
american
instances
of
this
worship
of
god
by
god
see
pinches
religion
of
babylonia
and
this
account
has
been
claimed
as
a
weak
version
of
that
part
of
the
creation
story
which
deals
with
the
creation
of
the
host
of
the
abyss
the
fact
that
nergal
states
that
he
destroyed
these
monsters
might
justify
us
in
believing
that
the
myth
was
on
this
occasion
so
edited
as
to
provide

iii
early
babylonian
religion
the
beginnings
of
babylonian
religion
the
true
beginning
of
a
religion
is
that
epoch
in
its
history
when
it
succeeds
by
reason
of
local
or
national
circumstances
and
environment
and
by
racial
genius
in
raising
itself
from
those
purely
animistic
influences
which
are
characteristic
of
early
faith
and
from
which
all
great
religions
have
emerged
if
they
have
not
been
able
entirely
to
free
themselves
from
associations
which
by
reason
of
their
antiquity
and
the
hold
they
achieve
on
the
mind
of
humanity
are
particularly
difficult
to
cast
off
thus
a
sense
of
nationality
and
the
attainment
of
a
high
standard
of
righteousness
assisted
in
shaping
jewish
religion
the
necessity
for
military
efficiency
and
therefore
of
sacrifice
to
the
gods
was
moulding
a
real
if
terrible
religion
in
ancient
mexico
when
the
invading
spaniards
ended
the
hideous
masque
of
tragedy
insight
and
meditation
lent
an
air
of
ethical
exaltation
to
the
vedic
religion
of
india
thus
in
a
manner
peculiarly
its
own
and
according
to
the
trend
of
its
particular
genius
did
each
race
evolve
a
suitable
religion
from
an
original
animistic
basis
if
we
are
to
discover
the
foundations
of
any
system
or
cult
however
if
we
are
to
excavate
the
soil
religious
as
we
would
the
soil
archæological
in
the
hope
of
coming
upon
the
basis
of
any
particular
faith
we
must
undertake
the
work
in
a
manner
as
thorough
as
that
of
the
antiquary
who
pick
in
hand
delves
his
way
to
the
lowest
foundations
of
palace
or
temple
the
earliest
babylonian
religious
ideas
that
is
subsequent
to
the
entrance
of
that
people
into
the
country
watered
by
the
tigris
and
euphrates
were
undoubtedly
coloured
by
those
of
the
sumerians
whom
they
found
in
the
country
they
adopted
the
alphabet
of
that
race
and
this
affords
strong
presumptive
evidence
that
the
immigrant
semites
as
an
unlettered
people
would
naturally
accept
much
if
not
all
of
the
religion
of
the
more
cultured
folk
whom
they
found
in
possession
of
the
soil
there
is
no
necessity
in
this
place
to
outline
the
nature
of
animistic
belief
at
any
length
this
has
been
done
in
so
many
other
volumes
of
this
series
and
in
such
detail
that
it
is
sufficient
to
state
here
succinctly
that
animism
is
a
condition
of
thought
or
belief
in
which
man
considers
everything
in
the
universe
along
with
himself
to
be
the
possessor
of
or
at
least
volition
thus
the
wind
water
animals
the
heavenly
bodies
all
live
move
and
have
their
being
and
because
of
his
fear
of
or
admiration
for
them
man
placates
or
adores
them
until
at
length
he
almost
unconsciously
exalts
them
into
a
condition
of
godhead
have
we
any
reason
to
think
that
the
ancient
semites
of
babylonia
regarded
the
universe
as
peopled
by
gods
or
godlings
of
such
a
type
the
proofs
that
they
did
so
are
not
a
few
spirits
and
gods
spirits
swarmed
in
ancient
babylonia
as
the
reader
will
observe
when
he
comes
to
peruse
the
chapter
dealing
with
the
magical
ideas
of
the
race
and
here
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
determinative
or
symbolic
written
sign
for
is
the
same
as
that
for
thus
the
god
and
the
spirit
must
in
babylonia
have
had
a
common
descent
the
manner
in
which
we
can
distinguish
between
a
god
and
a
spirit
however
is
simple
lists
of
the
gods
are
provided
in
the
historical
texts
whereas
spirits
and
demons
are
not
included
therein
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
systematize
the
belief
in
spirits
in
babylonia
for
just
as
the
great
gods
of
the
universe
were
apportioned
their
several
offices
so
were
the
spirits
allotted
almost
exactly
similar
powers
thus
the
were
perhaps
regarded
as
the
spirits
of
earth
and
the
as
spirits
of
heaven
so
at
least
are
they
designated
in
an
inscription
of
rammannirari
i
the
grouping
evidently
survived
from
animistic
times
when
perhaps
the
spirits
which
are
embraced
in
these
two
classes
were
the
only
of
the
babylonians
or
sumerians
and
from
whose
ranks
some
of
the
great
gods
of
future
times
may
have
been
evolved
in
any
case
they
belong
to
a
very
early
period
in
the
babylonian
religion
and
play
no
unimportant
part
in
it
almost
to
the
end
the
god
anu
the
most
ancient
of
the
babylonian
deities
was
regarded
as
the
father
of
both
companies
but
other
gods
make
use
of
their
services
they
do
not
appear
to
be
well
disposed
to
humanity
the
assyrian
kings
were
wont
to
invoke
them
when
they
desired
to
inculcate
a
fear
of
their
majesty
in
the
people
and
from
this
it
may
be
inferred
that
they
were
objects
of
peculiar
fear
to
the
lower
orders
of
the
population
for
the
people
often
cling
to
the
elder
cults
and
the
elder
pantheons
despite
the
innovations
of
ecclesiastical
politicians
or
the
religious
eccentricities
of
kings
there
can
however
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
truly
animistic
character
of
early
babylonian
religion
thus
in
the
early
inscriptions
one
reads
of
the
spirits
of
various
kinds
of
diseases
the
spirit
of
the
south
wind
the
spirits
of
the
mist
and
so
forth
the
or
sacred
stones
marking
the
residence
of
a
god
were
probably
a
link
between
the
fetish
and
the
idol
remaining
even
after
the
fully
developed
idol
had
been
evolved
was
babylonian
religion
semitic
in
type
it
has
already
been
stated
that
the
religion
of
ancient
babylon
was
probably
greatly
influenced
by
those
people
whom
the
semitic
babylonians
found
occupying
the
country
when
they
entered
it
the
question
then
arises
and
it
is
one
of
high
importance
how
far
did
the
religion
of
ancient
babylonia
and
assyria
partake
of
the
character
of
that
group
of
religions
which
has
been
called
the
classical
pronouncement
upon
this
phase
of
the
subject
is
probably
that
of
the
late
professor
robertson
smith
who
in
his
of
the
says
the
preponderating
opinion
of
assyriologists
is
to
the
effect
that
the
civilization
of
assyria
and
babylonia
was
not
purely
semitic
and
that
the
ancient
population
of
these
parts
contained
a
large
element
whose
influence
is
especially
to
be
recognized
in
religion
and
in
the
sacred
literature
of
the
cuneiform
records
if
this
be
so
it
is
plain
that
the
cuneiform
material
must
be
used
with
caution
in
our
enquiry
into
the
type
of
traditional
religion
characteristic
of
the
ancient
semites
that
babylonia
is
the
best
for
a
comparative
study
of
the
sacred
beliefs
and
practices
of
the
semitic
peoples
is
an
idea
which
has
lately
had
some
vogue
and
which
at
first
sight
appears
plausible
on
account
of
the
great
antiquity
of
the
monumental
evidence
but
in
matters
of
this
sort
ancient
and
primitive
are
not
synonymous
terms
and
we
must
not
look
for
the
most
primitive
form
of
semitic
faith
in
a
region
where
society
was
not
primitive
in
babylonia
it
would
seem
society
and
religion
alike
were
based
on
a
fusion
of
two
races
and
so
were
not
primitive
but
complex
moreover
the
official
system
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
religion
as
it
is
known
to
us
from
priestly
texts
and
public
inscriptions
bears
clear
marks
of
being
something
more
than
a
popular
traditional
faith
it
has
been
artificially
moulded
by
priestcraft
and
statecraft
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
official
religion
of
egypt
that
is
to
say
it
is
in
great
measure
an
artificial
combination
for
imperial
purposes
of
elements
drawn
from
a
number
of
local
worships
in
all
probability
the
actual
religion
of
the
masses
was
always
much
simpler
than
the
official
system
and
in
later
times
it
would
seem
that
both
in
religion
and
in
race
assyria
was
little
different
from
the
adjacent
aramæan
countries
these
remarks
are
not
meant
to
throw
doubt
on
the
great
importance
of
cuneiform
studies
for
the
history
of
semitic
religion
the
monumental
data
are
valuable
for
comparison
with
what
we
know
of
the
faith
and
worship
of
other
semitic
peoples
and
peculiarly
valuable
because
in
religion
as
in
other
matters
the
civilization
of
the
valley
exercised
a
great
historical
influence
on
a
large
part
of
the
semitic
field
totemism
in
babylonian
religion
signs
of
totemism
are
not
wanting
in
the
babylonian
as
in
other
religious
systems
many
of
the
gods
are
pictured
as
riding
upon
the
backs
of
certain
animals
an
almost
certain
indication
that
at
one
time
they
had
themselves
possessed
the
form
of
the
animal
they
bestrode
religious
conservatism
would
probably
not
tolerate
the
immediate
abolition
of
the
so
this
means
was
taken
of
gradually
it
but
some
gods
retained
animal
form
until
comparatively
late
times
thus
the
of
kis
had
the
form
of
an
eagle
and
we
find
that
ishtar
took
as
lovers
a
horse
an
eagle
and
a
lion
surely
gods
who
were
represented
in
equine
aquiline
and
leonine
forms
the
of
oannes
the
god
of
wisdom
is
certainly
a
relic
of
totemism
some
of
the
old
ideographic
representations
of
the
names
of
the
gods
are
eloquent
of
a
totemic
connexion
thus
the
name
of
ea
the
god
of
the
deep
is
expressed
by
an
ideograph
which
signifies
ea
is
spoken
of
as
antelope
of
the
deep
lusty
antelope
and
so
forth
he
was
also
as
a
connected
with
the
serpent
a
universal
symbol
of
the
flowing
stream
the
strange
god
uz
probably
an
akkadian
survival
was
worshipped
under
the
form
of
a
goat
the
of
nippur
adar
was
connected
with
the
pig
and
was
called
of
the
swine
merodach
may
have
been
a
in
early
astronomical
literature
we
find
him
alluded
to
as
bull
of
light
the
zu
as
is
seen
by
his
myth
retained
his
form
another
name
of
the
was
lugalbanda
patron
god
of
the
city
of
marad
near
sippara
like
prometheus
also
once
a
as
is
proved
by
many
analogous
myths
he
stole
the
sacred
fire
from
heaven
for
the
service
and
mental
illumination
of
man
the
great
gods
in
the
phase
in
which
it
becomes
first
known
to
us
babylonian
religion
is
neither
semitic
nor
akkadian
but
that
is
the
elements
of
both
religious
forms
are
so
intermingled
in
it
that
they
can
not
be
distinguished
one
from
another
but
very
little
that
is
trustworthy
can
be
advanced
concerning
this
shadowy
time
each
petty
state
and
these
were
numerous
in
early
babylonia
possessed
its
own
tutelar
deity
and
he
again
had
command
over
a
number
of
lesser
gods
when
all
those
pantheons
were
added
together
as
was
the
case
in
later
days
they
afforded
the
spectacle
of
perhaps
the
largest
assembly
of
gods
known
to
any
religion
the
most
outstanding
of
these
tribal
divinities
as
they
might
justly
be
called
were
merodach
who
was
worshipped
at
babylon
shamash
who
was
adored
at
sippar
sin
the
who
ruled
at
ur
anu
who
held
sway
over
erech
and
der
ea
the
oannes
of
legend
whose
city
was
eridu
bel
who
ruled
at
nippur
or
niffur
nergal
of
cuthah
and
ishtar
who
was
goddess
of
nineveh
the
peoples
of
the
several
provinces
identified
their
prominent
gods
one
with
another
and
indeed
when
assyria
rose
to
rivalry
with
babylonia
its
chief
divinity
asshur
was
naturally
identified
with
merodach
illustration
types
of
the
chief
god
of
nippur
and
of
his
consort
from
belief
and
practice
in
babylonia
and
by
professor
morris
by
permission
of
messrs
putnam
sons
in
the
chapter
on
cosmology
we
have
seen
how
merodach
gained
the
lordship
of
heaven
it
has
been
shown
that
the
rise
of
this
god
to
power
was
comparatively
recent
prior
to
the
days
of
khammurabi
a
rather
different
pantheon
from
that
described
in
later
inscriptions
held
sway
in
those
more
primitive
days
the
principal
gods
appear
to
have
been
bel
or
belit
or
his
queen
ea
nergal
shamash
sin
anu
and
other
lesser
divinities
there
is
indeed
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
and
types
of
religion
attempts
had
been
made
to
form
a
pantheon
before
khammurabi
day
but
his
exaltation
of
merodach
the
patron
of
babylon
to
the
head
of
the
babylonian
pantheon
was
destined
to
destroy
these
a
glance
at
the
condition
of
the
great
gods
before
the
days
of
khammurabi
will
assist
us
to
understand
their
later
developments
bel
bel
or
to
give
him
his
earlier
name
is
spoken
of
in
very
early
inscriptions
especially
in
those
of
nippur
of
which
city
he
was
the
tutelar
deity
he
was
described
as
the
of
the
lower
world
and
much
effort
seems
to
have
been
made
to
reach
a
definite
conception
of
his
position
and
attributes
his
name
had
also
been
translated
of
mist
the
title
had
been
given
to
merodach
by
i
about
after
which
he
was
referred
to
as
older
bel
the
chief
seat
of
his
worship
was
at
nippur
where
the
name
of
his
temple
or
came
to
be
applied
to
a
sanctuary
all
over
babylonia
he
was
also
addressed
as
the
of
the
and
as
the
mountain
and
his
consort
is
also
alluded
to
as
of
the
mountain
jastrow
rightly
concludes
that
there
are
substantial
reasons
for
assuming
that
his
original
city
was
on
the
top
of
some
mountain
as
is
so
generally
the
case
of
there
being
no
mountains
in
the
euphrates
valley
however
the
conclusion
is
warranted
that
was
the
god
of
a
people
whose
home
was
in
a
mountainous
region
and
who
brought
their
god
with
them
when
they
came
to
the
euphrates
valley
is
undoubtedly
of
the
class
of
who
dwell
on
mountain
peaks
no
text
appears
to
have
been
found
which
alludes
to
him
as
of
a
red
colour
the
flashing
of
the
lightning
through
the
clouds
which
veil
the
mountain
summits
usually
generates
a
belief
in
the
mind
of
primitive
man
that
the
god
who
is
concealed
by
the
screen
of
vapour
is
red
in
hue
and
quick
in
movement
the
second
tablet
of
a
text
known
as
the
storm
alludes
to
as
a
addressing
him
it
says
spirit
that
overcomes
no
evildoing
spirit
that
has
no
mother
spirit
that
has
no
wife
spirit
that
has
no
sister
spirit
that
has
no
brother
that
knows
no
abiding
place
the
spirit
that
devastates
the
fold
that
wrecks
the
stall
that
sweeps
away
son
and
mother
like
a
reed
as
a
huge
deluge
it
tears
away
dwellings
consumes
the
provisions
of
the
home
smites
mankind
everywhere
and
wickedly
drowns
the
harvests
of
the
land
devoted
temples
it
devastates
devoted
men
it
afflicts
him
that
clothes
himself
in
a
robe
of
majesty
the
spirit
lays
low
with
cold
him
of
wide
pasture
lands
with
hunger
it
lays
low
when
the
lord
of
lands
cries
out
at
sunset
the
dreadful
word
goes
forth
unto
the
spacious
shrine
nippur
the
city
of
was
of
sumerian
origin
so
we
must
connect
the
earliest
cult
of
with
the
sumerian
aborigines
many
of
his
lesser
names
point
to
such
a
conclusion
but
he
greatly
outgrew
all
local
circumstances
and
among
other
things
he
appears
to
have
been
a
god
who
fostered
vegetation
some
authorities
appear
to
be
of
opinion
that
because
was
regarded
as
a
god
of
vegetation
the
change
was
owing
to
his
removal
from
a
mountainous
region
to
a
more
level
neighbourhood
the
truth
is
it
would
be
difficult
to
discover
a
god
who
wielded
the
powers
of
the
wind
and
rain
who
was
not
a
patron
of
agriculture
but
as
he
sends
beneficent
rains
so
also
may
he
destroy
and
devastate
as
we
have
seen
from
the
foregoing
text
the
noise
of
the
storm
was
spoken
of
as
his
probably
too
because
he
was
a
very
old
god
he
was
regarded
in
some
localities
as
a
creator
of
the
world
the
great
winged
bull
of
assyrian
art
may
well
often
represent
no
symbol
could
better
typify
the
tempest
which
the
babylonians
regarded
as
rushing
and
rioting
unrestrained
over
country
and
city
overturning
even
tower
and
temple
with
its
violence
and
tumbling
the
wretched
reed
huts
of
the
lower
caste
into
the
dust
the
word
which
occurs
in
the
name
signifies
a
and
may
therefore
mean
the
this
shows
the
very
early
animistic
nature
of
the
god
there
appear
to
be
other
traditions
of
him
as
a
but
these
are
so
obscure
as
scarcely
to
be
worth
notice
in
the
trinity
which
consisted
of
bel
ea
and
anu
he
is
regarded
as
the
of
the
earth
that
is
the
earth
is
his
sphere
and
he
is
at
times
addressed
as
the
lord
of
the
lands
we
find
the
of
the
wind
or
alluded
to
in
the
of
the
kiches
of
central
america
where
hurakan
the
deity
from
whose
name
we
probably
get
our
word
sweeps
over
the
face
of
the
primeval
deep
voicing
his
commands
bel
and
the
dragon
the
picturesque
legend
of
bel
and
the
dragon
which
appears
in
the
apocrypha
and
which
was
at
one
time
appended
to
the
book
of
daniel
shows
us
the
manner
in
which
bel
was
worshipped
at
babylon
and
how
he
was
supposed
to
take
human
shape
devour
food
and
behave
very
much
as
a
man
might
the
legend
states
that
the
babylonians
lavished
every
day
upon
the
idol
of
bel
twelve
great
measures
of
fine
flour
and
forty
sheep
and
six
vessels
of
wine
king
cyrus
of
persia
who
had
overthrown
the
babylonian
kingdom
went
daily
to
worship
bel
and
asked
daniel
why
he
did
not
do
likewise
the
prophet
replied
that
his
religion
did
not
permit
him
to
worship
idols
but
rather
the
living
god
who
had
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
then
said
cyrus
thou
not
that
bel
is
the
living
god
seest
thou
not
how
much
he
eateth
and
drinketh
every
day
then
daniel
smiled
and
said
king
be
not
deceived
for
he
is
but
clay
within
and
brass
without
and
can
never
eat
or
drink
anything
cyrus
was
exceeding
wroth
and
calling
for
his
priests
said
to
them
ye
tell
me
not
who
this
is
that
devoureth
these
expenses
ye
shall
die
but
if
ye
can
show
me
that
bel
devours
them
daniel
shall
die
for
he
hath
spoken
blasphemy
against
bel
and
to
this
daniel
cheerfully
agreed
it
would
have
been
surprising
had
not
the
provisions
vanished
because
we
are
told
that
the
priests
of
bel
were
threescore
and
ten
in
number
and
had
numerous
wives
and
children
so
cyrus
and
daniel
betook
themselves
to
the
temple
of
bel
and
the
priests
asked
them
to
bless
the
meat
and
wine
before
bel
and
to
shut
the
door
fast
and
seal
it
with
the
king
own
signet
stating
that
if
they
came
on
the
morrow
they
would
find
that
bel
had
eaten
up
all
of
the
provisions
but
they
had
taken
good
care
to
protect
themselves
for
they
had
made
a
secret
entrance
underneath
the
great
table
in
the
temple
which
they
used
constantly
so
that
they
might
consume
the
good
things
that
were
set
before
the
idol
and
cyrus
did
as
the
priests
asked
setting
the
meat
and
wine
before
the
statue
of
bel
but
daniel
commanded
his
servants
to
bring
ashes
which
they
strewed
throughout
the
temple
in
the
presence
of
the
king
then
they
went
out
and
shut
the
door
and
sealed
it
with
the
signet
and
in
the
night
time
the
priests
with
their
wives
and
families
entered
the
temple
by
the
secret
way
and
speedily
consumed
the
provisions
in
the
morning
cyrus
and
daniel
betook
themselves
to
the
temple
and
the
king
broke
the
seals
and
opened
the
door
and
when
he
perceived
that
all
the
provisions
had
vanished
he
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
great
art
thou
o
bel
and
with
thee
is
no
deceit
at
all
but
daniel
laughed
and
barring
the
king
way
into
the
temple
requested
him
to
look
at
the
pavement
and
mark
well
whose
footsteps
he
saw
there
and
cyrus
replied
i
see
the
footsteps
of
men
women
and
children
he
at
once
called
the
priests
who
when
they
saw
that
their
stratagem
had
been
discovered
showed
him
the
secret
way
into
the
temple
and
in
his
rage
cyrus
slew
them
and
delivered
bel
into
daniel
power
the
prophet
speedily
destroyed
the
idol
and
the
temple
which
sheltered
it
now
in
that
temple
was
a
great
dragon
worshipped
by
the
people
of
babylon
and
the
king
said
to
daniel
wilt
thou
also
say
that
this
is
of
brass
for
behold
he
liveth
he
eateth
and
drinketh
therefore
shouldest
thou
worship
him
but
daniel
shook
his
head
and
said
to
cyrus
give
me
leave
o
king
and
i
will
slay
this
dragon
without
sword
or
staff
then
daniel
took
pitch
and
fat
and
hair
and
boiled
them
all
together
and
shaped
them
into
great
pieces
these
he
placed
in
the
mouth
and
shortly
the
dragon
burst
asunder
now
the
people
of
babylon
became
greatly
incensed
at
these
doings
and
clamoured
to
cyrus
asking
him
to
deliver
daniel
up
to
them
or
else
they
would
destroy
him
and
all
belonging
to
him
and
continues
the
legend
cyrus
being
afraid
for
his
crown
delivered
daniel
to
the
people
who
cast
him
into
a
lions
den
where
he
remained
for
six
days
seven
lions
were
in
the
den
and
their
food
was
removed
from
them
so
that
they
might
be
the
fiercer
and
the
apocrypha
story
which
differs
considerably
from
that
given
in
the
sixth
chapter
of
the
book
of
daniel
states
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
took
up
a
certain
prophet
called
habbacuc
who
was
about
to
carry
a
mess
of
pottage
to
certain
reapers
and
taking
him
by

daniel

in
the

on

cyrus
came

so
impressed

cyrus
with
the

he
resolved
to

him

seizing

had
been
instrumental

beltis
beltis
or
the
wife
of
shared
his
authority
over
nippur
where
she
had
a
temple
which
went
back
in
antiquity
to
the
first
dynasty
of
ur
as
has
been
said
she
was
also
called
the
of
the
mountain
and
as
such
she
had
a
sanctuary
at
girsu
a
quarter
of
lagash
in
certain
inscriptions
she
is
described
as
mother
of
the
gods
the
name
beltis
meant
and
as
such
was
accorded
to
her
as
being
lady
but
it
was
afterwards
given
to
many
other
goddesses
the
temple
of
bel
in
mr
george
smith
discovered
a
babylonian
text
giving
a
remarkable
account
of
the
temple
of
bel
at
babylon
this
temple
the
wonder
of
babylon
was
founded
while
that
city
was
still
a
place
of
no
very
great
importance
but
its
fabric
lasted
until
the
days
of
herodotus
and
strabo
who
have
furnished
us
with
accounts
of
it
the
former
states
that
it
consisted
of
eight
stages
or
towers
one
above
another
forming
a
pyramid
the
holy
of
holies
being
placed
upon
the
highest
stage
of
all
the
height
of
the
entire
building
being
about
feet
a
very
questionable
dimension
in
the
cuneiform
tablet
the
measurements
of
the
outer
court
are
given
as
feet
in
length
and
feet
in
breadth
an
adjoining
court
that
of
ishtar
and
zamama
was
feet
by
feet
and
had
six
gates
which
admitted
worshippers
to
the
temple
the
grand
gate
the
gate
of
the
rising
sun
looking
eastward
the
great
gate
the
gate
of
the
colossi
flanked
by
enormous
figures
the
canal
gate
and
the
gate
of
the
a
walled
space
platform
or
orientated
so
as
to
face
the
four
cardinal
points
is
next
described
inside
this
stood
a
building
the
name
of
which
is
indecipherable
it
was
connected
in
some
manner
with
the
ziggurat
or
great
tower
around
the
base
of
which
were
ranged
the
temples
of
the
principal
gods
all
of
which
faced
one
or
other
of
the
four
chief
points
of
the
compass
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
group
stood
a
large
temple
feet
by
feet
broad
containing
no
less
than
sixteen
shrines
the
principal
of
which
were
sacred
to
nebo
the
son
of
bel
and
his
wife
tashmit
to
the
north
were
temples
to
ea
and
nusku
the
first
feet
long
by
feet
broad
and
the
second
a
square
feet
either
way
to
the
south
was
a
shrine
to
bel
and
anu
feet
by
feet
the
purpose
of
the
buildings
on
the
western
side
of
the
great
tower
is
only
to
be
conjectured
it
is
known
however
that
the
couch
of
bel
and
his
throne
of
gold
alluded
to
by
herodotus
were
housed
in
one
or
other
of
the
buildings
on
this
side
the
couch
is
said
to
have
measured
feet
by
feet
inches
in
the
centre
towered
the
great
ziggurat
rising
stage
upon
stage
its
sides
facing
the
cardinal
points
the
first
stage
was
feet
square
and
feet
high
and
was
ornamented
with
buttresses
the
second
was
feet
square
and
feet
high
the
third
feet
square
and
feet
high
up
to
the
seventh
stage
which
was
feet
long
feet
broad
and
feet
high
the
entire
height
of
the
ziggurat
was
thus
feet
exactly
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
base
or
only
half
the
height
attributed
to
it
by
herodotus
regarding
the
possible
site
of
this
temple
mr
smith
says
the
only
ruin
now
existing
at
or
near
babylon
which
can
be
supposed
to
represent
the
temple
of
belus
is
the
mound
and
enclosure
of
bâbil
the
ruins
corresponding
fairly
with
the
account
of
these
structures
in
the
greek
authors
and
in
the
inscription
the
sides
of
the
building
face
the
cardinal
points
like
those
in
the
inscription
the
remains
of
the
two
sides
of
the
enclosure
now
existing
indicate
a
circumference
about
equal
to
the
greek
measurement
and
slightly
in
excess
of
that
in
the
inscription
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
exact
length
of
the
babylonian
measures
is
not
known
and
there
are
different
opinions
even
as
to
the
length
of
the
greek
stade
while
the
present
remains
of
the
wall
require
careful
measurement
to
determine
more
exactly
their
length
and
the
dimensions
they
indicate
on
the
other
side
of
the
euphrates
stands
a
ruin
birs
nimrûd
also
consisting
of
an
enclosure
various
temples
and
a
but
this
represents
the
site
of
the
temple
of
nebo
at
borsippa
and
its
angles
instead
of
its
sides
face
the
cardinal
points
while
not
a
single
one
of
its
known
dimensions
agrees
with
the
corresponding
point
in
the
inscription
the
mound
of
bâbil
which
is
already
identified
by
the
best
authorities
with
the
temple
of
belus
consists
now
of
the
lower
stage
of
the
tower
and
the
ruins
of
the
buildings
round
it
yet
herodotus
account
of
the
temple
of
bel
was
not
wholly
false
he
says
it
had
gates
of
brass
and
was
two
stadia
every
way
being
quadrangular
in
the
middle
of
the
temple
a
solid
tower
was
built
a
stadium
in
height
and
breadth
and
on
this
tower
was
placed
another
and
another
still
on
this
to
the
number
of
eight
towers
in
all
the
ascent
was
on
the
outside
and
was
made
by
a
winding
passage
round
all
the
towers
and
about
half
up
the
ascent
there
is
a
landing
and
seats
for
rest
where
those
ascending
may
repose
and
in
the
highest
tower
there
is
a
large
temple
and
in
the
temple
a
large
bed
well
furnished
and
beside
it
a
golden
table
but
there
is
no
statue
erected
in
it
and
by
night
no
one
lodges
in
it
except
a
single
woman
of
the
country
whom
the
god
has
selected
from
the
rest
as
say
the
chaldæans
who
are
the
priests
of
this
god
an
inscription
was
discovered
and
translated
by
sir
rawlinson
in
which
king
nebuchadrezzar
boasts
of
having
repaired
and
completed
this
tower
in
honour
of
his
god
merodach
behold
now
the
building
named
stages
of
the
seven
spheres
which
was
the
wonder
of
borsippa
had
been
built
by
a
former
king
he
had
completed
ammas
of
the
height
but
he
did
not
finish
its
head
from
the
lapse
of
time
it
had
become
ruined
they
had
not
taken
care
of
the
exits
of
the
waters
so
the
rain
and
wet
had
penetrated
into
the
brickwork
the
casing
of
burnt
brick
had
bulged
out
and
the
terraces
of
crude
brick
lay
scattered
in
heaps
then
merodach
my
great
lord
inclined
my
heart
to
repair
the
building
i
did
not
change
its
site
nor
did
i
destroy
the
foundation
platform
but
in
a
fortunate
month
and
on
an
auspicious
day
i
undertook
the
rebuilding
of
the
crude
brick
terraces
and
the
burnt
brick
casing
of
the
temple
i
strengthened
its
foundations
and
i
placed
a
titular
record
in
the
parts
that
i
had
rebuilt
i
set
my
hand
to
build
it
up
and
to
finish
its
summit
as
it
had
been
in
former
days
thus
i
exalted
its
head
nergal
nergal
was
the
patron
god
of
cuthah
eastward
from
babylon
he
was
a
god
of
extremely
ancient
origin
and
indeed
the
first
inscription
which
alludes
to
him
is
dated
about
he
is
mentioned
in
the
old
testament
kings
xvii
as
an
idol
whom
the
babylonians
who
israel
brought
with
them
he
seems
to
have
had
a
close
connexion
with
the
nether
world
indeed
he
is
practically
the
head
of
its
pantheon
he
appears
to
have
been
a
god
of
gloom
and
death
and
his
name
may
signify
lord
of
the
great
dwelling
place
that
is
the
grave
his
city
cuthah
may
possibly
have
been
renowned
as
a
we
find
him
associated
with
pestilence
and
famine
but
he
has
also
a
solar
significance
he
is
indeed
the
sun
in
its
malevolent
form
fierce
and
destroying
for
in
myth
the
sun
can
be
evil
as
well
as
good
we
thus
find
the
solar
power
depicted
as
a
fierce
warrior
slaying
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
again
it
is
quite
possible
for
a
solar
deity
to
have
an
underworld
connexion
seeing
that
the
sun
is
supposed
to
travel
through
that
gloomy
region
during
the
night
we
thus
see
how
nergal
could
combine
so
many
seemingly
conflicting
attributes
as
god
of
the
dead
he
has
a
host
of
demons
at
his
command
and
it
may
be
these
who
do
his
behests
in
spreading
pestilence
and
war
where
he
goes
violent
death
follows
in
his
wake
at
times
he
is
called
the
of
fire
the
king
who
burns
and
the
one
and
he
is
identified
with
the
fierceness
of
flame
in
this
respect
he
is
not
at
all
unlike
the
scandinavian
loki
who
typifies
the
malevolence
of
fire
dibarra
dibarra
was
probably
a
variant
of
nergal
in
his
guise
as
solar
destroyer
concerning
him
a
strange
myth
is
recounted
as
follows
the
sons
of
babylon
were
as
birds
and
thou
their
falconer
in
a
net
thou
didst
catch
them
enclose
them
and
destroy
them
o
warrior
dibarra
leaving
the
city
thou
didst
pass
to
the
outside
taking
on
the
form
of
a
lion
thou
didst
enter
the
palace
the
people
saw
thee
and
drew
their
weapons
so
spoke
ishum
the
faithful
attendant
of
dibarra
by
way
of
beginning
an
account
of
the
havoc
wrought
in
the
valley
of
euphrates
by
the
and
spare
no
one
is
the
gist
of
his
commands
to
his
satellites
have
neither
fear
nor
pity
kill
the
young
as
well
as
the
old
and
rob
babylon
of
all
its
treasures
accordingly
against
the
first
city
a
large
army
was
dispatched
to
carry
out
these
instructions
and
the
battle
with
bow
and
sword
was
begun
a
strife
which
ended
so
disastrously
for
the
soldiers
and
inhabitants
that
their
blood
flowed
like
torrents
of
water
through
the
highways
this
defeat
the
great
lord
merodach
was
compelled
to
witness
powerless
to
help
or
avert
it
enraged
at
his
helplessness
and
overcome
with
fury
he
cursed
his
enemies
until
he
is
said
to
have
lost
consciousness
because
of
his
grief
from
this
scene
of
devastation
dibarra
turned
his
attention
to
erech
appointing
others
of
his
host
to
mete
out
to
this
city
the
fate
of
babylon
ishtar
goddess
of
erech
saw
her
devoted
city
exposed
to
plunder
pillage
and
bloodshed
and
had
to
endure
the
agony
of
inactivity
experienced
by
merodach
nothing
she
could
do
or
say
would
stay
the
violence
of
dibarra
vengeance
o
warrior
dibarra
thou
dost
dispatch
the
just
thou
dost
dispatch
the
unjust
who
sins
against
thee
thou
dost
dispatch
and
the
one
who
does
not
sin
against
thee
thou
dost
dispatch
these
words
were
used
by
ishum
dibarra
servant
in
a
subsequent
address
to
the
god
of
war
he
knew
his
lord
craving
for
battle
and
bloodshed
was
still
unappeased
and
he
himself
was
planning
a
war
more
terrible
than
any
he
had
yet
conducted
a
conflict
not
only
but
which
was
to
embrace
heaven
itself
so
in
order
to
gain
consent
to
the
hideous
destruction
he
anticipated
he
continued
to
pander
to
his
tendencies
said
he
the
brightness
of
i
will
destroy
the
root
of
the
tree
i
will
tear
out
that
it
no
longer
blossom
against
the
dwelling
of
the
king
of
gods
i
will
proceed
to
all
of
which
the
listened
with
growing
pleasure
until
fired
by
his
myrmidon
words
he
cried
out

sudden
fierce

he
added
later
carry
out
the
word
thou
hast
spoken
in
accordance
with
thy
desire
and
with
alacrity
ishum
obeyed
directing
his
countenance
to
the
mountain
of
this
with
the
help
of
the
god
sibi
a
warrior
unequalled
he
attacked
and
destroyed
all
the
vineyards
in
the
forest
of
khashur
and
finally
the
city
of
inmarmaon
these
last
atrocious
acts
roused
ea
the
god
of
humanity
and
filled
him
with
wrath
though
what
attitude
he
adopted
towards
dibarra
is
not
known
listen
all
of
you
to
my
words
because
of
sin
did
i
formerly
plan
evil
my
heart
was
enraged
and
i
swept
peoples
away
this
was
dibarra
defence
when
eventually
he
was
propitiated
and
all
the
gods
were
gathered
together
in
council
with
him
ishum
at
this
point
changing
his
tactics
urged
on
dibarra
the
necessity
for
pacifying
the
gods
he
had
incensed
appease
said
he
the
gods
of
the
land
who
are
angry
may
fruits
and
corn
flourish
may
mountains
and
seas
bring
their
produce
as
he
had
listened
to
ishum
before
dibarra
listened
again
and
the
council
of
the
gods
was
closed
by
his
promising
prosperity
and
protection
to
those
who
would
fittingly
honour
him
he
who
glorifies
my
name
will
rule
the
world
who
proclaims
the
glory
of
my
power
will
be
without
rival
the
singer
who
sings
of
my
deeds
will
not
die
through
pestilence
to
kings
and
nobles
his
words
will
be
pleasing
the
writer
who
preserves
them
will
escape
from
the
grasp
of
the
enemy
in
the
temple
where
the
people
proclaim
my
name
i
will
open
his
ear
in
the
house
where
this
tablet
is
set
up
though
war
may
rage
and
the
god
sibi
work
havoc
sword
and
pestilence
will
not
touch
him
he
will
dwell
in
safety
let
this
song
resound
for
ever
and
endure
for
eternity
let
all
lands
hear
it
and
proclaim
my
power
let
the
inhabitants
of
all
places
learn
to
glorify
my
name
shamash
shamash
god
of
the
sun
was
one
of
the
most
popular
deities
of
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
pantheon
we
find
him
mentioned
first
in
the
reign
of
or
about
he
is
called
the
son
of
sin
the
which
perhaps
has
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
solar
calendar
succeeded
the
lunar
in
babylonia
as
in
practically
all
civilizations
of
any
advancement
the
inscriptions
give
due
prominence
to
his
status
as
a
great
lord
of
light
and
in
them
he
is
called
the
of
the
regions
of
living
creatures
one
of
the
lands
and
so
forth
he
is
supposed
to
throw
open
the
gates
of
the
morning
and
raise
his
head
over
the
horizon
lighting
up
the
heaven
and
earth
with
his
beams
the
knowledge
of
justice
and
injustice
and
the
virtue
of
righteousness
were
attributed
to
him
and
he
was
regarded
as
a
judge
between
good
and
evil
for
as
the
light
of
the
sun
penetrates
everywhere
and
nothing
can
be
hidden
from
its
beams
it
is
not
strange
that
it
should
stand
as
the
symbol
for
justice
shamash
appears
at
the
head
of
the
inscription
which
bears
the
laws
of
khammurabi
and
here
he
stands
as
the
symbol
for
justice
the
towns
at
which
he
was
principally
worshipped
were
sippar
and
larsa
where
his
sanctuary
was
known
as
or
the
house
larsa
was
probably
the
older
of
the
two
centres
but
from
the
times
of
sargon
sippar
became
the
more
important
and
in
the
days
of
khammurabi
ranked
immediately
after
babylon
in
fact
it
appears
to
have
threatened
the
supremacy
of
the
capital
to
some
extent
and
nabonidus
the
last
king
of
babylon
as
we
shall
remember
offended
merodach
and
his
priests
by
his
too
eager
notice
of
shamash
during
the
whole
course
of
babylonian
history
however
shamash
retained
his
popularity
and
was
perhaps
the
only
who
was
not
absorbed
by
merodach
one
finds
the
same
phenomenon
in
ancient
mexico
where
various
solar
deities
did
not
succeed
in
displacing
or
absorbing
totec
the
ancient
god
of
the
sun
but
shamash
succeeded
in
absorbing
many
small
local
and
indeed
we
find
his
name
used
as
that
of
the
sun
throughout
semitic
lands
there
were
several
solar
deities
such
as
nergal
and
ninib
whom
shamash
did
not
absorb
probably
for
the
reason
that
they
typify
various
phases
of
the
sun
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
in
ancient
times
even
shamash
was
not
an
entirely
beneficent
solar
deity
but
like
nergal
could
figure
as
a
warrior
on
occasion
but
in
later
times
he
was
regarded
as
the
god
who
brings
light
and
life
upon
all
created
things
and
upon
whom
depends
everything
in
nature
from
man
to
vegetable
his
consort
was
aa
who
was
worshipped
at
sippar
along
with
him
her
cult
seems
to
have
been
one
of
great
antiquity
but
she
does
not
appear
to
have
any
distinctive
character
of
her
own
she
was
supposed
to
receive
the
sun
upon
his
setting
and
from
this
circumstance
it
has
been
argued
she
perhaps
represents
the
sun
from
the
magnified
disk
which
he
presents
at
sunset
but
this
explanation
is
perhaps
rather
too
much
on
allegorical
lines
jastrow
thinks
that
she
may
have
been
evolved
from
the
of
a
city
on
the
other
side
of
the
euphrates
from
sippar
such
an
amalgamation
of
two
originally
male
deities
into
a
combination
of
male
and
female
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
us
he
says
is
in
keeping
with
the
lack
of
sharp
distinction
between
male
and
female
in
the
oldest
forms
of
semitic
religions
in
the
old
cuneiform
writing
the
same
sign
is
used
to
indicate
or
when
attached
to
deities
ishtar
appears
amongst
the
semites
both
as
male
and
female
sex
was
primarily
a
question
of
strength
the
stronger
god
was
viewed
as
masculine
the
weaker
as
feminine
ea
ea
was
the
third
of
the
great
babylonian
triad
of
gods
which
consisted
of
anu
and
himself
he
was
a
god
of
the
waters
and
like
anu
is
called
the
of
the
gods
as
a
god
of
the
abyss
he
appears
to
have
been
also
a
deity
of
wisdom
and
occult
power
thus
allegorically
associated
with
the
idea
of
depth
or
profundity
he
was
the
father
of
merodach
who
consulted
him
on
the
most
important
matters
connected
with
his
kingship
of
the
gods
indeed
he
was
consulted
by
individuals
of
all
classes
who
desired
light
to
be
thrown
upon
their
crafts
or
businesses
thus
he
was
the
god
of
artisans
in
general
blacksmiths
sailors
and
artificers
of
every
kind
he
was
also
the
patron
of
prophets
and
seers
as
the
abyss
is
the
place
where
the
seeds
of
everything
were
supposed
to
fructify
so
he
appears
to
have
fostered
reproduction
of
every
description
he
was
supposed
to
dwell
beside
anu
who
inhabited
the
pole
of
the
ecliptic
the
site
of
his
chief
temple
was
at
eridu
which
at
one
time
stood
before
the
waters
receded
upon
the
shore
of
the
persian
gulf
we
have
seen
already
that
ea
under
his
greek
name
of
oannes
was
supposed
to
bring
knowledge
and
culture
to
the
people
of
eridu
there
are
many
confusing
myths
connected
with
him
and
he
seems
in
some
measure
to
enter
into
the
babylonian
myth
of
the
deluge
alexander
polyhistor
apollodorus
and
eusebius
copying
from
berossus
state
that
he
rose
from
the
sea
upon
his
civilizing
mission
and
abydenus
says
that
in
the
time
of
daon
the
shepherd
king
of
the
city
of
pantibiblon
meaning
the
where
books
were
gathered
together
annedatus
appeared
again
from
the
eruthrean
sea
in
the
same
form
as
those
who
had
showed
themselves
before
having
the
shape
of
a
fish
blended
with
that
of
a
man
then
reigned
aedorachus
of
pantibiblon
for
the
term
of
eighteen
sari
in
his
days
there
appeared
another
personage
from
the
sea
of
eruthra
like
those
above
having
the
same
complicated
form
between
fish
and
man
his
name
was
odacon
from
remarks
by
apollodorus
it
would
seem
that
these
beings
were
messengers
from
oannes
but
the
whole
passages
are
very
obscure
the
chief
extract
from
the
fragments
of
berossus
concerning
oannes
states
that
in
the
first
year
there
made
its
appearance
from
a
part
of
the
eruthrean
sea
which
bordered
upon
babylonia
an
animal
endowed
with
reason
who
was
called
oannes
according
to
the
accounts
of
apollodorus
the
whole
body
of
the
animal
was
like
that
of
a
fish
and
had
under
a
fish
head
another
head
and
also
feet
below
similar
to
those
of
a
man
subjoined
to
the
fish
tail
his
speech
too
was
articulate
and
human
and
there
was
a
representation
of
him
to
be
seen
in
the
time
of
berossus
this
being
in
the
daytime
used
to
converse
with
men
but
took
no
food
at
that
season
and
he
gave
them
an
insight
into
letters
and
science
and
every
kind
of
art
he
taught
them
to
construct
houses
to
found
temples
to
compile
laws
and
explained
to
them
the
principles
of
geometrical
knowledge
he
made
them
distinguish
the
seeds
of
the
earth
and
showed
them
how
to
collect
fruits
in
short
he
instructed
them
in
everything
which
could
tend
to
soften
manners
and
humanize
mankind
from
that
time
so
universal
were
his
instructions
nothing
material
has
been
added
by
way
of
improvement
when
the
sun
set
it
was
the
custom
of
this
being
to
plunge
again
into
the
sea
and
abide
all
the
night
in
the
deep
after
this
there
appeared
other
creatures
like
oannes
of
which
berossus
promises
to
give
an
account
when
he
comes
to
the
history
of
the
kings
the
writings
of
oannes
moreover
says
polyhistor
oannes
wrote
concerning
the
generation
of
mankind
of
their
different
ways
of
life
and
of
civil
polity
and
the
following
is
the
purport
of
what
he
said
was
nothing
but
darkness
and
an
abyss
of
water
wherein
resided
most
hideous
beings
which
were
produced
of
a
twofold
principle
men
appeared
with
two
wings
some
with
four
and
with
two
faces
they
had
one
body
but
two
heads
the
one
of
a
man
the
other
of
a
woman
they
were
likewise
in
their
several
organs
both
male
and
female
other
human
figures
were
to
be
seen
with
the
legs
and
horns
of
goats
some
had
horses
feet
others
had
the
limbs
of
a
horse
behind
but
before
were
fashioned
like
men
resembling
hippocentaurs
bulls
likewise
bred
there
with
the
heads
of
men
and
dogs
with
fourfold
bodies
and
the
tails
of
fishes
also
horses
with
the
heads
of
dogs
men
too
and
other
animals
with
the
heads
and
bodies
of
horses
and
the
tails
of
fishes
in
short
there
were
creatures
with
the
limbs
of
every
species
of
animals
add
to
these
fishes
reptiles
serpents
with
other
wonderful
animals
which
assumed
each
other
shape
and
countenance
of
all
these
were
preserved
delineations
in
the
temple
of
belus
at
babylon
the
person
who
was
supposed
to
have
presided
over
them
had
the
name
of
omorca
this
in
the
chaldaic
language
is
thalath
which
the
greeks
express
the
sea
but
according
to
the
most
probable
theory
it
is
equivalent
to
the
moon
all
things
being
in
this
situation
belus
came
and
cut
the
asunder
and
out
of
one
half
of
her
he
formed
the
earth
and
of
the
other
half
the
heavens
at
the
same
time
he
destroyed
the
animals
in
the
abyss
all
this
berossus
said
was
an
allegorical
description
of
nature
for
the
whole
universe
consisting
of
moisture
and
animals
being
continually
generated
therein
the
deity
belus
cut
off
his
own
head
upon
which
the
other
gods
mixed
the
blood
as
it
gushed
out
with
the
earth
and
from
this
men
were
formed
on
this
account
it
is
that
they
are
rational
and
partake
of
divine
knowledge
this
belus
whom
men
call
dis
divided
the
darkness
and
separated
the
heavens
from
the
earth
and
reduced
the
universe
to
order
but
the
animals
so
lately
created
not
being
able
to
bear
the
prevalence
of
light
died
belus
upon
this
seeing
a
vast
space
quite
uninhabited
though
by
nature
very
fruitful
ordered
one
of
the
gods
to
take
off
his
head
and
when
it
was
taken
off
they
were
to
mix
the
blood
with
the
soil
of
the
earth
and
from
thence
to
form
other
men
and
animals
which
should
be
capable
of
bearing
the
light
belus
also
formed
the
stars
and
the
sun
and
moon
together
with
the
five
planets
this
myth
related
by
ea
or
oannes
regarding
the
creation
of
the
world
bears
a
very
close
relation
to
that
of
merodach
and
tiawath
told
in
chapter
ii
it
is
not
often
that
one
finds
a
acting
as
a
culture
hero
although
we
find
in
mexican
myth
a
certain
deity
alluded
to
as
the
old
of
our
flesh
allegorical
mythology
would
have
seen
in
ea
a
hero
arriving
from
another
clime
in
a
vessel
who
had
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
and
had
instructed
the
rude
inhabitants
thereof
in
the
culture
of
a
higher
civilization
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
ea
has
a
close
connexion
in
some
manner
with
the
noah
legend
of
the
deluge
for
example
a
sumerian
text
exists
in
which
it
would
seem
as
if
the
ship
of
ea
was
described
as
the
timbers
of
which
its
various
parts
were
constructed
are
mentioned
and
the
refugees
it
saved
consisted
of
ea
himself
dawkina
his
wife
merodach
and
inesh
the
pilot
of
eridu
along
with
of
course
it
would
seem
natural
to
the
babylonians
to
regard
the
persian
gulf
as
the
great
abyss
whence
all
things
emanated
as
jastrow
very
justly
remarks
in
the
word
of
ea
of
a
character
more
spiritual
than
that
of
he
commands
and
what
he
plans
comes
into
existence
a
wholly
beneficent
power
he
blesses
the
fields
and
heals
mankind
his
most
striking
trait
is
his
love
of
humanity
in
conflicts
between
the
gods
and
mankind
he
is
invariably
on
the
side
of
the
latter
when
the
gods
at
the
instance
of
as
the
of
storms
decide
to
bring
on
a
deluge
to
sweep
away
mankind
it
is
ea
who
reveals
the
secret
to
his
favourite
noah
who
saves
himself
his
family
and
his
belongings
on
a
ship
that
he
is
instructed
to
build
the
waters
personified
by
him
are
not
those
of
the
turbulent
and
treacherous
ocean
but
those
of
irrigating
streams
and
canals
he
is
thus
very
different
from
the
god
the
of
heaven
who
possesses
so
many
attributes
of
destruction
ea
in
his
benevolent
way
thwarts
the
purpose
of
the
riotous
god
of
tempest
which
greatly
enrages
and
it
has
been
thought
that
this
myth
suggests
the
rivalry
which
perhaps
at
one
time
existed
between
the
two
religious
centres
of
eridu
and
nippur
cities
of
ea
and
respectively
in
an
eloquent
manner
ea
implores
not
to
precipitate
another
deluge
and
begs
that
instead
of
such
wholesale
destruction
man
may
be
punished
by
sending
lions
and
jackals
or
by
famines
or
pestilences
hearkens
to
his
speech
his
heart
is
touched
and
he
blesses
utnapishtim
and
his
wife
if
this
myth
is
a
piece
of
priestcraft
it
argues
better
relations
between
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
at
eridu
and
nippur
ea
had
many
other
names
the
chief
of
which
meaning
of
great
strength
alluded
to
his
patronage
of
the
smith
art
he
was
also
called
which
describes
him
as
of
the
earth
through
which
his
waters
meandered
in
such
a
country
as
babylonia
earth
and
water
are
closely
associated
as
under
that
soil
water
is
always
to
be
found
at
a
distance
of
a
few
feet
thus
the
interior
of
the
earth
is
the
domain
of
ea
the
story
of
adapa
and
the
south
wind
here
is
the
story
of
adapa
the
son
of
ea
who
but
for
his
obedience
to
his
father
command
might
have
attained
deification
and
immortality
one
day
when
adapa
was
out
in
his
boat
fishing
the
south
wind
blew
with
sudden
and
malicious
violence
upsetting
the
boat
and
flinging
the
fisherman
into
the
sea
when
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
shore
adapa
vowed
vengeance
against
the
south
wind
which
had
used
him
so
cruelly
shutu
thou
demon
he
cried
i
will
stretch
forth
my
hand
and
break
thy
wings
thou
shalt
not
go
unpunished
for
this
outrage
the
hideous
monster
laughed
as
she
soared
in
the
air
above
him
flapping
her
huge
wings
about
her
ungainly
body
adapa
in
his
fury
leapt
at
her
seized
her
wings
and
broke
them
so
that
she
was
no
longer
able
to
fly
over
the
broad
earth
then
he
went
his
way
and
related
to
his
father
what
he
had
done
seven
days
passed
by
and
anu
the
lord
of
heaven
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
south
wind
but
shutu
came
not
the
rains
and
the
floods
were
delayed
and
anu
grew
impatient
he
summoned
to
him
his
minister
ilabrat
wherefore
doth
shutu
neglect
her
duty
he
asked
what
hath
chanced
that
she
travels
not
afield
ilabrat
bowed
low
as
he
made
answer
listen
o
anu
and
i
will
tell
thee
why
shutu
flieth
not
abroad
ea
lord
of
the
deep
and
creator
of
all
things
hath
a
son
named
adapa
who
hath
crushed
and
broken
the
wings
of
thy
servant
shutu
so
that
she
is
no
more
able
to
fly
if
this
be
true
said
anu
summon
the
youth
before
me
and
let
him
answer
for
his
crime
be
it
so
o
anu
when
adapa
received
the
summons
to
appear
in
heaven
he
trembled
greatly
it
was
no
light
thing
to
answer
to
the
great
gods
for
the
of
their
servant
the
demon
shutu
nevertheless
he
began
to
make
preparations
for
his
journey
and
ere
he
set
out
his
father
ea
instructed
him
as
to
how
he
should
comport
himself
in
the
assembly
of
the
gods
wrap
thyself
not
in
a
vesture
of
gold
o
my
son
but
clothe
thee
in
the
garments
of
the
dead
at
the
gates
of
heaven
thou
wilt
find
tammuz
and
gishzida
guarding
the
way
salute
the
twain
with
due
respect
i
charge
thee
baring
thy
head
and
showing
all
deference
to
them
if
thou
dost
find
favour
in
their
eyes
they
will
speak
well
of
thee
before
anu
and
when
thou
standest
within
the
precincts
of
heaven
don
the
garment
that
is
given
thee
to
wear
and
anoint
thy
head
with
the
oil
that
is
brought
thee
but
when
the
gods
offer
thee
food
and
drink
touch
them
not
for
the
food
will
be
the
of
death
and
the
drink
the
of
death
let
neither
pass
within
thy
lips
go
now
my
son
and
remember
these
my
instructions
bear
thyself
with
humility
and
all
will
be
well
adapa
bade
his
father
farewell
and
set
out
on
his
journey
to
heaven
he
found
all
as
his
father
had
predicted
tammuz
and
gishzida
received
him
at
the
portals
of
the
divine
dwelling
and
so
humble
was
attitude
that
they
were
moved
with
compassion
towards
him
they
led
him
into
the
presence
of
anu
and
he
bowed
low
before
the
great
god
i
am
come
in
answer
to
thy
summons
said
he
have
mercy
upon
me
o
thou
most
high
anu
frowned
upon
him
it
is
said
of
thee
he
made
answer
that
thou
hast
broken
the
wings
of
shutu
the
south
wind
what
manner
of
man
art
thou
who
darest
destroy
shutu
in
thy
wrath
knowest
thou
not
that
the
people
suffer
for
lack
of
nourishment
that
the
herb
droopeth
and
the
cattle
lie
parched
on
the
scorching
ground
tell
me
why
hast
thou
done
this
thing
i
was
out
on
the
sea
fishing
said
adapa
and
the
south
wind
blew
violently
upsetting
my
boat
and
casting
me
into
the
water
therefore
i
seized
her
wings
and
broke
them
and
lo
i
am
come
to
seek
thy
pardon
then
tammuz
and
gishzida
the
deities
whose
favour
adapa
had
won
at
the
gates
of
heaven
stepped
forth
and
knelt
at
the
feet
of
their
king
be
merciful
o
anu
adapa
hath
been
sorely
tried
and
now
is
he
truly
humble
and
repentant
let
his
treatment
of
shutu
be
forgotten
anu
listened
to
the
words
of
tammuz
and
gishzida
and
his
wrath
was
turned
away
rise
adapa
he
said
kindly
thy
looks
please
me
well
thou
hast
seen
the
interior
of
this
our
kingdom
and
now
must
thou
remain
in
heaven
for
ever
and
we
will
make
thee
a
god
like
unto
us
what
sayest
thou
son
of
ea
adapa
bowed
low
before
the
king
of
the
gods
and
thanked
him
for
his
pardon
and
for
his
promise
of
godhead
anu
therefore
commanded
that
a
feast
be
made
and
that
the
of
life
and
the
of
life
be
placed
before
adapa
for
only
by
eating
and
drinking
of
these
could
he
attain
immortality
but
when
the
feast
was
spread
adapa
refused
to
partake
of
the
repast
for
he
remembered
his
father
injunctions
on
this
point
so
he
sat
in
silence
at
the
table
of
the
gods
whereupon
anu
exclaimed
what
now
adapa
why
dost
thou
not
eat
or
drink
except
thou
taste
of
the
food
and
water
set
before
thee
thou
canst
not
hope
to
live
for
ever
adapa
perceived
that
he
had
offended
his
divine
host
so
he
hastened
to
explain
be
not
wroth
most
mighty
anu
it
is
because
my
lord
ea
hath
so
commanded
that
i
break
not
bread
nor
drink
water
at
thy
table
turn
not
thy
countenance
from
me
i
beseech
thee
anu
frowned
is
it
that
ea
feared
i
should
seek
thy
life
by
offering
thee
deadly
food
truly
he
that
knoweth
so
much
and
hath
schooled
thee
in
so
many
different
arts
is
for
once
put
to
shame
adapa
would
have
spoken
but
the
lord
of
heaven
silenced
him
peace
he
said
then
to
his
attendants
bring
forth
a
garment
that
he
may
clothe
himself
and
oil
bring
also
to
anoint
his
head
when
the
king
command
had
been
carried
out
adapa
robed
himself
in
the
heavenly
garment
and
anointed
his
head
with
the
oil
then
he
addressed
anu
thus
o
anu
i
salute
thee
the
privilege
of
godhead
must
i
indeed
forego
but
never
shall
i
forget
the
honour
that
thou
wouldst
have
conferred
upon
me
ever
in
my
heart
shall
i
keep
the
words
thou
hast
spoken
and
the
memory
of
thy
kindness
shall
i
ever
retain
blame
me
not
exceedingly
i
pray
thee
my
lord
ea
awaiteth
my
return
truly
said
anu
i
censure
not
thy
decision
be
it
even
as
thou
wilt
go
my
son
and
peace
go
with
thee
and
thus
adapa
returned
to
the
abode
of
ea
lord
of
the
dead
and
there
for
many
years
he
lived
in
peace
and
happiness
anu
along
with
and
ea
anu
makes
up
the
universal
triad
he
is
called
the
of
the
gods
but
appears
to
be
descended
from
still
older
deities
his
name
is
seldom
discovered
in
the
inscriptions
prior
to
the
time
of
khammurabi
but
such
notices
as
occur
of
him
seem
to
have
already
fixed
his
position
as
a
ruler
of
the
sky
his
cult
was
specially
associated
with
the
city
of
erech
it
is
probable
that
in
the
earliest
days
he
had
been
the
original
sumerian
as
his
name
is
merely
a
form
of
the
sumerian
word
for
this
idea
is
assisted
by
the
manner
in
which
his
name
is
originally
written
in
the
inscriptions
as
the
symbol
signifying
it
is
usually
that
employed
for
it
is
plain
therefore
that
anu
was
once
regarded
as
the
expanse
of
heaven
itself
just
as
are
the
of
numerous
primitive
peoples
several
writers
who
deal
with
anu
appear
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
a
god
of
the
heavens
is
an
popular
fancy
says
jastrow
deals
with
realities
and
with
personified
powers
whose
workings
are
seen
and
felt
it
would
as
little
therefore
have
evolved
the
idea
that
there
was
a
power
to
be
identified
with
the
heavens
as
a
whole
of
which
the
azure
sky
is
a
symbol
as
it
would
personify
the
earth
as
a
whole
or
the
bodies
of
waters
as
a
whole
it
is
only
necessary
to
state
the
implications
involved
to
recognize
that
the
conception
of
a
triad
of
gods
corresponding
to
three
theoretical
divisions
of
the
universe
is
a
bit
of
learned
speculation
it
smacks
of
the
school
the
conception
of
a
god
of
heaven
fits
in
moreover
with
the
comparatively
advanced
period
when
the
seats
of
the
gods
were
placed
in
the
skies
and
the
gods
identified
with
the
stars
a
merely
superficial
acquaintance
with
the
nature
of
animism
and
the
of
primitive
and
barbarian
peoples
would
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
opposite
is
the
case
in
egyptian
polynesian
and
north
american
indian
myth
the
sky
itself
is
directly
personalized
egyptian
mythological
illustration
depicts
the
sky
in
female
form
for
in
egyptian
myth
the
sky
is
the
mother
and
the
earth
the
father
of
everything
lang
has
shown
that
the
is
frequently
personalized
as
a
magnified
man
among
races
which
possess
no
theological
schools
we
do
not
say
that
the
arrangement
of
anu
ea
and
into
a
triad
is
not
a
bit
of
learned
speculation
but
to
state
that
early
animism
did
not
first
personalize
the
sky
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
is
rash
in
the
extreme
when
deucalion
and
pyrrha
in
the
greek
myth
asked
the
gods
how
they
might
best
replenish
the
earth
with
the
human
race
they
were
instructed
to
cast
the
bones
of
their
mother
behind
them
and
these
bones
they
interpreted
as
the
stones
and
rocks
and
acted
accordingly
so
would
primitive
man
all
the
world
over
have
interpreted
this
advice
for
universally
he
believes
the
very
soil
upon
which
he
walks
to
be
the
great
mother
which
produced
his
ancestors
out
of
whose
dust
or
clay
they
were
formed
and
who
still
nourishes
and
preserves
him
jastrow
proceeds
to
state
that
anu
was
originally
the
personification
of
some
definite
power
of
nature
and
everything
points
to
this
power
having
been
the
sun
in
the
heavens
starting
from
this
point
of
view
we
quite
understand
how
the
great
illuminer
of
heaven
should
have
been
identified
with
the
heavens
in
an
artificially
devised
theological
system
just
as
became
in
this
system
the
designation
of
the
earth
and
of
the
region
above
the
earth
viewed
as
a
whole
the
very
fact
that
in
the
earliest
times
anu
was
identified
with
the
expanse
of
the
sky
itself
and
that
the
symbol
used
to
denote
him
meant
is
against
this
supposition
again
the
theory
suffers
from
lack
of
analogy
in
what
other
mythology
is
there
to
be
found
a
who
at
one
time
possessed
a
solar
significance
the
converse
might
be
the
case
some
have
attained
the
solar
connexion
because
of
their
rule
over
the
entire
expanse
of
the
heavens
just
as
they
have
attained
the
power
of
wielding
lightning
and
the
wind
but
we
are
at
a
loss
to
recall
any
deity
originally
of
distinctive
solar
attributes
who
later
took
the
position
of
a
anu
was
regarded
as
head
of
the
triad
and
the
father
of
we
are
told
that
the
goddess
aruru
first
shaped
man
in
the
image
of
anu
who
must
thus
have
attained
an
anthropomorphic
condition
he
appears
also
to
have
been
regarded
as
the
conqueror
of
primeval
chaos
his
consort
was
anatu
probably
a
later
feminine
form
of
himself
ishtar
ishtar
was
undoubtedly
a
goddess
of
semitic
origin
and
symbolized
the
fertility
of
the
earth
she
was
the
mother
who
fostered
all
vegetation
and
agriculture
it
is
probable
that
her
cult
originated
at
erech
and
in
the
course
of
centuries
and
under
many
nominal
changes
dispersed
itself
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
western
asia
and
even
into
greece
and
egypt
it
is
probable
that
a
number
of
lesser
goddesses
such
as
nanâ
and
anunit
may
have
become
merged
in
the
conception
of
this
divinity
and
that
lesser
local
deities
of
the
same
character
as
herself
may
have
taken
her
name
and
assisted
to
swell
her
reputation
she
is
frequently
addressed
as
of
the
gods
and
indeed
the
name
became
a
generic
designation
for
but
these
were
later
honours
when
her
cult
centred
at
erech
it
appears
to
have
speedily
blossomed
out
in
many
directions
and
as
has
been
said
lesser
cults
probably
eagerly
identified
themselves
with
that
of
the
great
so
that
in
time
her
worship
became
more
than
a
babylonian
cult
indeed
wherever
people
of
semitic
speech
were
to
be
found
there
was
the
worship
of
ishtar
as
ashteroth
or
astarte
she
was
known
to
canaanites
ph
oe
nicians
and
greeks
and
there
is
some
likelihood
that
the
cult
of
aphrodite
had
also
its
beginnings
in
that
of
ishtar
we
shall
enquire
later
whether
she
can
be
the
esther
of
the
scriptures
astrologically
she
was
identified
with
the
planet
venus
but
so
numerous
were
the
attributes
surrounding
her
taken
from
other
goddesses
with
which
she
had
become
identified
that
they
threatened
to
overshadow
her
real
character
which
was
that
of
the
great
and
fertile
mother
more
especially
did
her
identification
with
the
consort
of
the
threaten
to
alter
her
real
nature
as
in
this
guise
she
was
regarded
as
a
goddess
of
war
it
is
seldom
that
a
goddess
of
fertility
or
love
achieves
such
a
distinction
gods
possessing
an
agricultural
significance
are
nearly
always
but
that
is
because
they
bring
the
fertilizing
and
therefore
possess
the
lightning
arrow
or
spear
but
ishtar
is
specifically
a
goddess
of
the
class
of
persephone
or
isis
and
her
identification
with
battle
must
be
regarded
as
purely
accidental
in
later
times
in
assyria
she
was
conceived
as
the
consort
of
asshur
head
of
the
assyrian
pantheon
in
days
when
a
god
or
goddess
who
did
not
breathe
war
was
of
little
use
to
a
people
like
the
assyrians
who
were
constantly
employed
in
hostilities
and
this
circumstance
naturally
heightened
her
reputation
as
a
warlike
divinity
but
it
is
at
present
her
original
character
with
which
we
are
occupied
indeed
in
some
texts
we
find
that
so
far
from
being
able
to
protect
herself
ishtar
and
her
property
are
made
the
prey
of
the
savage
the
his
word
sent
me
forth
she
complains
as
often
as
it
comes
to
me
it
casts
me
prostrate
upon
my
face
the
unconsecrated
foe
entered
my
courts
placed
his
unwashed
hands
upon
me
and
caused
me
to
tremble
putting
forth
his
hand
he
smote
me
with
fear
he
tore
away
my
robe
and
clothed
his
wife
therein
he
stripped
off
my
jewels
and
placed
them
upon
his
daughter
like
a
quivering
dove
upon
a
beam
i
sat
like
a
fleeing
bird
from
my
cranny
swiftly
i
passed
from
my
temple
like
a
bird
they
caused
me
to
fly
such
is
the
plaint
of
ishtar
who
in
this
case
appears
to
be
quite
helpless
before
the
enemy
the
myth
which
best
illustrates
her
character
is
that
which
speaks
of
her
journey
to
aralu
the
underworld
illustration
ishtar
the
ishtar
as
the
goddess
of
ishtar
the
goddess
of
from
belief
and
practice
in
babylonia
and
by
professor
morris
jastrow
by
permission
of
messrs
putnam
sons
the
descent
of
ishtar
into
hades
the
poem
which
in
its
existing
form
consists
of
lines
in
cuneiform
characters
appears
to
be
incomplete
we
are
not
told
therein
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
goddess
in
journeying
to
the
of
but
we
gather
from
various
legends
and
from
the
concluding
portion
of
the
poem
itself
that
she
went
thither
in
search
of
her
bridegroom
tammuz
the
of
eridu
the
importance
of
the
myth
of
ishtar
and
tammuz
lies
partly
in
the
fact
that
travelling
westwards
to
greece
by
way
of
ph
oe
nicia
it
furnished
a
groundwork
for
classic
myths
of
the
type
which
still
provide
mythologists
with
matter
for
endless
speculation
the
mythological
significance
of
the
poem
and
the
persons
it
mentions
will
be
dealt
with
later
the
theories
concerning
the
primitive
status
of
tammuz
and
ishtar
are
numerous
and
distinct
more
than
one
of
them
being
sufficiently
plausible
to
call
for
a
careful
scrutiny
consideration
of
the
myth
may
therefore
be
deferred
till
we
have
glanced
at
the
babylonian
story
itself
and
some
of
its
principal
variants
and
analogues
tammuz
and
ishtar
the
myth
of
tammuz
is
one
of
high
antiquity
dating
possibly
from
or
even
earlier
both
tammuz
and
ishtar
were
originally
the
name
of
the
former
deity
being
derived
from
the
akkadian
of
life
or
only
son
perhaps
a
contraction
of
of
the
spirit
of
the
deep
as
professor
sayce
indicates
the
of
the
deep
is
of
course
the
ea
and
tammuz
apparently
typifies
the
sun
though
he
is
not
as
will
presently
be
seen
a
simple
solar
deity
but
a
god
who
unites
in
himself
the
attributes
of
various
departmental
divinities
an
ancient
akkadian
hymn
addresses
tammuz
as
shepherd
and
lord
husband
of
ishtar
the
lady
of
heaven
lord
of
the
underworld
lord
of
the
shepherd
seat
as
grain
which
lies
unwatered
in
the
meadow
which
beareth
no
green
blade
as
a
sapling
planted
in
a
waterless
place
as
a
sapling
torn
out
by
the
root
professor
sayce
identifies
him
with
that
daonus
or
daos
whom
berossus
states
to
have
been
the
sixth
king
of
babylonia
during
the
mythical
period
tammuz
is
the
shepherd
of
the
sky
and
his
flocks
and
herds
like
those
of
st
ilya
in
slavonic
are
the
and
the
fleecy
vapours
of
the
heavens
ishtar
has
from
an
early
period
been
associated
with
tammuz
as
his
consort
as
she
has
indeed
with
merodach
and
assur
and
other
deities
yet
she
is
by
no
means
a
mere
reflection
of
the
male
divinity
but
has
a
distinct
individuality
of
her
own
differing
in
this
from
all
other
babylonian
goddesses
and
betraying
her
origin
the
widespread
character
of
the
worship
of
ishtar
is
remarkable
none
of
the
babylonian
or
assyrian
deities
were
adopted
into
the
pantheons
of
so
many
alien
races
from
the
persian
gulf
to
the
pillars
of
hercules
she
was
adored
as
the
great
mother
of
all
living
she
has
been
identified
with
dawkina
wife
of
ea
and
is
therefore
mother
of
tammuz
as
well
as
his
consort
this
dual
relationship
may
account
for
that
which
appears
in
later
myths
among
the
greeks
where
smyrna
mother
of
adonis
is
also
his
sister
ishtar
was
regarded
sometimes
as
the
daughter
of
the
anu
and
sometimes
as
the
child
of
sin
the
lunar
deity
her
worship
in
babylonia
was
universal
and
in
time
displaced
that
of
tammuz
himself
the
love
of
ishtar
for
tammuz
represents
the
wooing
of
the
of
by
the
goddess
of
fertility
the
god
is
slain
by
the
relentless
heat
of
summer
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
ishtar
enters
aralu
in
search
of
her
youthful
husband
the
poem
we
are
about
to
consider
briefly
deals
with
a
part
only
of
the
myth
the
story
of
ishtar
descent
into
aralu
it
opens
thus
to
the
land
of
the
region
of
darkness
ishtar
the
daughter
of
sin
turned
her
ear
even
ishtar
the
daughter
of
sin
turned
her
ear
to
the
abode
of
darkness
the
dwelling
of
irkalla
to
the
house
whose
enterer
goes
not
forth
to
the
road
whence
the
wayfarer
never
returns
to
the
house
whose
inhabitants
see
no
light
to
the
region
where
dust
is
their
bread
and
their
food
mud
they
see
no
light
they
dwell
in
darkness
they
are
clothed
like
the
birds
in
a
garment
of
feathers
on
the
door
and
the
bolt
hath
the
dust
fallen
the
moral
contained
in
this
passage
is
a
gloomy
one
for
mortal
man
he
who
enters
the
dread
precincts
of
aralu
goes
not
forth
he
is
doomed
to
remain
for
ever
in
the
enveloping
darkness
his
sustenance
mud
and
dust
the
mention
of
the
dust
which
lies
on
door
and
bolt
strikes
a
peculiarly
bleak
and
dreary
note
like
other
primitive
races
the
ancient
babylonians
painted
the
other
world
not
definitely
as
a
place
of
reward
or
punishment
but
rather
as
a
weak
reflection
of
the
a
region
of
darkness
and
passive
misery
which
must
have
offered
a
singularly
uninviting
prospect
to
a
vigorous
human
being
the
garment
of
feathers
is
somewhat
puzzling
why
should
the
dead
wear
a
garment
of
feathers
unless
it
be
that
the
identified
in
some
of
his
aspects
with
the
eagle
descends
into
the
underworld
in
a
dress
of
feathers
and
that
therefore
mortals
who
follow
him
must
appear
in
the
nether
regions
in
similar
guise
the
description
above
quoted
of
the
babylonian
hades
tallies
with
that
given
in
dream
to
eabani
by
the
ukhut
gilgamesh
epic
tablet
vii
at
the
gates
of
aralu
coming
to
the
gate
of
aralu
ishtar
assumes
a
menacing
aspect
and
threatens
to
break
down
the
door
and
shatter
its
bolts
and
bars
if
she
be
not
admitted
straightway
the
keeper
of
the
gate
endeavours
to
soothe
the
irate
deity
and
goes
to
announce
her
presence
to
allatu
the
mistress
of
hades
from
his
words
it
would
appear
that
ishtar
has
journeyed
thither
in
search
of
the
waters
of
life
wherewith
to
restore
her
husband
tammuz
to
life
allatu
receives
the
news
of
her
sister
advent
with
a
bitter
tirade
but
nevertheless
instructs
the
keeper
to
admit
her
which
he
proceeds
to
do
ishtar
on
entering
the
sombre
domains
is
obliged
to
pass
through
seven
gates
at
each
of
which
she
is
relieved
of
some
article
of
dress
or
adornment
evidently
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
custom
of
aralu
till
at
last
she
stands
entirely
unclad
at
the
first
gate
the
keeper
takes
from
her
the
mighty
crown
of
her
head
at
the
second
her
earrings
are
taken
at
the

her
necklace
at
the
fourth
the
ornaments
of
her
breast
at
the
fifth
her
jewelled
girdle
at
the
sixth
her
bracelets
and
at
the
seventh
the
cincture
of
her
body
the
goddess
does
not
part
with
these
save
under
protest
but
the
keeper
of
the
gate
answers
all
her
queries
with
the
words
enter
o
lady
it
is
the
command
of
allatu
the
divine
wayfarer
at
length
appears
before
the
goddess
of

who
shows
her
scant
courtesy
bidding
the
namtar
smite
her
from
head
to
foot
with
disease
in
her
eyes
side
feet
heart
and
head
during
the
time
that
ishtar
is
confined
within
the
bounds
of
aralu
all
fertility
on
the
earth
is
suspended
both
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
knowledge
of
this
disastrous
state
of
affairs
is
conveyed
to
the
gods
by
their
messenger
who
first
tells
the
story
to
shamash
the
shamash
weeps
as
he
bears
the

before

gods
of
the

and

respectively
but
ea
to

the
sterility
of
the
earth
creates
a
being
called

he
dispatches
to
the
underworld
to
demand
the
release
of
ishtar
allatu
is
greatly
enraged
when
the
demand
is
made
in
the
name
of
the
great
gods
and
curses
with
a
terrible
curse
condemning
him
to
dwell
in
the
darkness
of
a
dungeon
with
the
garbage
of
the
city
for
his
food
nevertheless
she
can
not
resist
the
power
of
the
conjuration
wherefore
she
bids
namtar
the

the
annunaki

place
them
on

golden
throne
and
pour
the
waters
of

over

in

words
of

he
smote
the
palace
he
shattered
the
threshold
which
bore
up
the
stones
of
light
he
bade
the
spirits
of
earth
come
forth
on

of
gold
did
he
seat
them
over
ishtar
he
poured
the
waters
of

and
brought
her
along
ishtar
is
then
led
through
the
seven
gates
of
arula
receiving
at
each
the
article
of
attire
whereof
she
had
there
been
deprived
finally
she
emerges
into
the
which
resumes
its
normal
course
then
follow
a
few
lines
addressed
to
ishtar
perhaps
by
the
or
by
the
keeper
of
the
gates

she
allatu
hath
not

the

the
bridegroom
of
thy
youth
pour
over
him
pure
waters
and
precious

on
him
a
purple
robe
and
a
ring
of
crystal
on
his
hand
let
samkhat
the
goddess
of
joy
enter
the
liver
these
lines
indicate
with
sufficient
clearness
that
ishtar
descended
into
hades
in
order
to
obtain
the
waters
of
life
and
thus
revive
her
bridegroom
tammuz
the
poem
does
not
relate
whether
or
not
her
errand
was
successful
but
we
are
left
to
conjecture
that
it
was
there
still
remain
a
few
lines
of
the
poem
not
however
continuing
the
narrative
but
forming
a
sort
of
epilogue
addressed
it
may
be
to
the
hearers
of
the
tale
mention
is
made
in
this
portion
of
mourners
wailing
men
and
wailing
women
of
a
funeral
pyre
and
the
burning
of
incense
evidently
in
honour
of
the
god
tammuz
ishtar
and
persephone
as
has
been
indicated
already
the
myth
of
tammuz
and
ishtar
furnished
the
groundwork
for
certain
myths
of
classic
greece
and
rome
the
ph
oe
nician
astarte
ashtoreth
a
development
of
ishtar
became
in
time
the
aphrodite
of
the
greeks
a
deity
who
plays
a
part
in
the
adonis
legend
analogous
to
that
of
ishtar
in
the
tammuz
story
the
name
adonis
itself
is
derived
from
lord
the
word
with
which
the
ph
oe
nician
worshippers
of
tammuz
hailed
the
setting
sun
the
myth
of
adonis
is
perhaps
the
most
nearly
related
of
any
to
that
of
tammuz
since
its
chief
characters
are
acknowledged
counterparts
of
those
in
the
babylonian
legend
while
the
tale
of
ishtar
descent
into
hades
may
be
regarded
as
a
sequel
to
the
greek
story
or
rather
to
an
early
babylonian
variant
thereof
briefly
outlined
the
story
runs
as
follows
adonis
was
the
fruit
of
an
unnatural
union
between
the
syrian
king
theias
and
his
daughter
smyrna
myrrha
theias
pursued
the
princess
intending
to
take
her
life
for
the
crime
but
the
pity
of
the
gods
turned
her
into
a
tree
from
which
at
the
end
of
ten
months
adonis
was
born
it
is
said
that
a
boar
rent
open
the
with
its
tusk
and
thus
enabled
the
divine
infant
to
see
the
light
aphrodite
charmed
with
the
beauty
of
the
child
gave
him
into
the
care
of
persephone
who
was
so
enamoured
of
her
charge
that
she
afterwards
refused
to
give
him
up
the
goddesses
appealed
to
zeus
who
decreed
that
adonis
should
spend
six
months
of
each
year
with
aphrodite
and
six
with
persephone
in
the
underworld
or
according
to
another
version
four
months
were
to
be
passed
with
aphrodite
and
four
with
persephone
while
the
remaining
four
were
to
be
at
his
own
disposal
he
was
afterwards
slain
by
a
boar
sent
against
him
by
artemis
herself
by
the
way
a
development
of
ishtar
it
may
be
remarked
that
aphrodite
who
figures
like
ishtar
as
the
goddess
of
love
and
beauty
is
also
closely
associated
with
the
nether
regions
perhaps
because
she
was
identified
with
the
babylonian
goddess
in
her
journey
to
hades
in
search
of
her
spouse
akin
to
adonis
is
the
god
attis
who
likewise
according
to
one
version
of
his
myth
is
slain
by
a
boar
after
his
death
he
becomes
a
and
from
his
blood
violets
spring
he
is
beloved
of
cybele
the
who
laments
his
untimely
end
in
the
adonis
legend
there
is
evidence
of
some
overlapping
persephone
or
proserpine
who
here
corresponds
to
the
allatu
of
the
babylonian
variant
figures
in
another
myth
as
the
prototype
of
tammuz
when
she
is
carried
off
to
the
netherworld
by
pluto
her
mother
ceres
will
not
suffer
the
corn
to
grow
while
her
daughter
remains
a
prisoner
like
ishtar
in
search
of
her
spouse
the
seeks
her
child
with
weeping
and
lamentation
through
the
eating
of
a
pomegranate
seed
proserpine
is
finally
obliged
to
pass
four
or
six
months
of
every
year
with
her
dark
captor
as
his
consort
another
myth
which
has
affinities
with
the
tale
of
tammuz
and
ishtar
is
the
egyptian
one
which
deals
with
the
quest
of
isis
the
god
osiris
is
slain
through
the
machinations
of
his
brother
set
who
being
identified
elsewhere
with
a
black
hog
recalls
the
boar
which
slew
adonis
and
attis
and
his
body
enclosed
in
a
chest
is
cast
into
the
nile
afterwards
the
chest
is
thrown
up
by
the
waves
and
round
it
springs
miraculously
a
tamarisk
tree
meanwhile
isis
wife
and
sister
to
osiris
travels
hither
and
thither
in
search
of
his
remains
which
in
due
time
she
finds
however
the
chest
is
stolen
from
her
by
set
who
taking
therefrom
the
body
of
osiris
tears
the
corpse
into
fourteen
pieces
which
he
scatters
broadcast
through
the
land
isis
still
pursues
her
quest
till
she
has
found
all
the
portions
and
buried
them
these
tales
were
the
mythical
correlates
of
certain
ritualistic
practices
designed
to
bring
about
the
change
of
seasons
and
other
natural
phenomena
by
means
of
sympathetic
magic
the
burden
of
a
great
duty
falls
upon
the
shoulders
of
primitive
man
with
his
rites
and
spells
and
magic
arts
he
must
assist
the
universe
in
its
course
his
esoteric
plays
typifying
the
mysterious
fact
of
growth
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
sprouting
of
the
corn
his
charms
and
incantations
are
essential
even
for
the
rising
of
the
sun
lacking
the
guarantee
of
science
that
one
season
shall
follow
another
in
its
proper
order
he
goes
through
an
elaborate
performance
symbolizing
the
decay
and
revival
of
vegetation
believing
that
only
thus
can
the
natural
order
be
maintained
through
the
force
of
sympathetic
magic
he
sees
his
puny
efforts
related
to
the
mighty
results
which
follow
them
this
then
is
the
origin
of
the
ritual
of
the
tammuz
festival
which
may
conceivably
have
had
an
existence
prior
to
that
of
the
myth
itself
the
representation
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
god
whether
in
myth
or
ritual
had
undoubtedly
a
seasonal
significance
wherefore
the
date
of
his
festival
varied
in
the
different
localities
in
babylonia
it
was
celebrated
in
june
thus
showing
that
the
deity
was
slain
by
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sun
burning
up
all
the
springtide
vegetation
ishtar
sojourn
in
hades
would
thus
occupy
the
arid
months
of
summer
in
other
and
more
temperate
climes
winter
would
be
regarded
as
the
enemy
of
tammuz
an
interesting
account
of
the
tammuz
festival
is
that
given
by
an
arabic
author
writing
in
the
tenth
century
and
quoted
by
sir
james
frazer
in
his
tammuz
july
in
the
middle
of
this
month
is
the
festival
of
that
is
of
the
weeping
women
and
this
is
the
festival
which
is
celebrated
in
honour
of
the
god
the
women
bewail
him
because
his
lord
slew
him
so
cruelly
ground
his
bones
in
a
mill
and
then
scattered
them
to
the
wind
the
women
during
this
festival
eat
nothing
which
has
been
ground
in
a
mill
but
limit
their
diet
to
steeped
wheat
sweet
vetches
dates
raisins
and
the
like
the
material
for
this
description
was
furnished
by
the
syrians
of
harran
of
the
curious
legend
attaching
to
the
mourning
rites
more
will
be
said
later
lamentations
for
tammuz
characteristic
of
the
tammuz
ritual
are
the
lamentations
of
which
several
series
are
still
extant
in
later
times
it
appears
that
a
different
cause
was
assigned
for
the
weeping
of
the
wailing
men
and
wailing
women
they
no
longer
mourned
the
death
of
tammuz
but
the
departure
of
ishtar
into
the
netherworld
and
so
the
legend
of
her
journey
to
aralu
came
to
be
recited
in
the
temples
sir
james
frazer
suggests
that
the
ritualistic
counterpart
of
the
myth
may
have
included
the
pouring
of
water
over
an
effigy
of
the
god
the
practice
corresponding
to
the
pouring
of
the
water
of
life
over
him
in
order
to
bring
him
back
to
life
if
this
indeed
formed
a
part
of
the
tammuz
ritual
we
may
take
it
that
it
was
intended
as
a
likewise
the
adonia
festival
of
the
greeks
symbolized
the
death
and
resurrection
of
adonis
this
feast
occupied
two
days
on
the
first
day
images
of
adonis
and
aphrodite
were
made
and
laid
each
on
a
silver
couch
on
the
second
day
these
images
were
cast
by
the
women
into
the
sea
together
with
gardens
as
they
were
called
pots
filled
with
earth
in
which
cut
flowers
were
stuck
it
is
believed
that
this
rite
was
meant
to
signify
the
revival
of
vegetation
under
the
influence
of
rain
the
persons
engaged
in
it
indulged
in
such
lamentations
as
were
uttered
by
the
worshippers
of
tammuz
in
babylonia
tore
their
hair
and
beat
their
breasts
the
festival
of
adonis
fell
in
the
at
alexandria
and
athens
in
the
spring
at
byblus
while
in
ph
oe
nicia
it
occurred
in
the
season
when
the
river
nahr
ibrahim
formerly
called
adonis
bore
down
from
the
mountains
of
lebanon
the
red
earth
in
which
the
devout
saw
the
blood
of
the
slain
adonis
golden
boxes
of
myrrh
were
employed
at
the
adonia
festival
incense
was
burned
and
pigs
were
sacrificed
pigs
were
sacrificed
also
to
osiris
whose
cult
as
has
been
shown
had
much
in
common
with
that
of
tammuz
and
adonis
the
egyptian
god
was
cast
by
his
enemies
into
the
waters
of
the
nile
and
it
may
be
that
this
myth
too
had
a
ritualistic
counterpart
designed
as
a
charm
to
produce
rain
it
has
been
indicated
already
that
the
elucidations
of
the
myth
of
ishtar
journey
to
aralu
are
many
and
divergent
the
variants
above
enumerated
serve
each
to
cast
light
on
the
other
and
from
a
comparison
of
these
we
may
succeed
in
arriving
at
a
satisfactory
conclusion
to
begin
with
however
it
must
be
remembered
that
when
the
cult
of
any
deity
has
reached
a
fairly
advanced
stage
it
is
impossible
to
assign
to
him
any
one
department
of
nature
to
say
that
he
is
a
a
a
for
he
may
possess
the
attributes
of
all
of
these
in
giving
any
god
a
departmental
designation
we
are
striving
to
express
his
primitive
or
predominant
characteristics
merely
illustration
the
evelyn
paul
an
allegorical
interpretation
of
the
myth
a
truly
allegorical
elucidation
of
the
myth
of
ishtar
descent
into
hades
would
depict
ishtar
as
the
goddess
of
fertility
seeking
in
the
underworld
for
her
husband
the
slain
by
the
icy
breath
of
winter
during
her
sojourn
in
the
nether
regions
all
fertility
ceases
on
the
earth
to
be
resumed
only
when
she
returns
as
the
joyful
bride
of
the
springtide
sun
the
surrender
of
her
clothing
and
jewels
at
the
seven
gates
of
aralu
represents
the
gradual
decay
of
vegetation
on
the
earth
and
the
resumption
of
her
garments
the
growing
beauty
and
verdure
which
mark
her
return
another
hypothesis
identifies
ishtar
with
dawkina
goddess
of
the
earth
wife
of
ea
and
therefore
mother
as
well
as
consort
of
tammuz
according
to
this
view
ishtar
represents
not
the
fertility
of
the
earth
but
the
earth
itself
deprived
of
its
adornments
of
flowers
and
leafage
by
the
approach
of
winter
or
variously
by
the
burning
heat
of
summer
the
waters
of
life
with
which
she
sprinkles
and
restores
her
husband
are
the
revivifying
rains
which
give
to
the
his
youthful
vigour
and
glory
against
this
view
it
has
been
urged
by
sir
james
frazer
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
sun
annual
course
within
the
temperate
and
tropical
zones
to
suggest
that
he
is
dead
for
half
or
a
third
of
the
year
and
alive
for
the
other
half
or
alternatively
it
is
suggested
that
tammuz
is
a
god
of
vegetation
and
that
ishtar
doubles
the
rôle
the
slaying
of
tammuz
and
the
journey
of
ishtar
would
thus
represent
two
distinct
myths
each
typifying
the
decay
and
subsequent
revival
of
vegetation
other
instances
may
be
recalled
in
which
two
myths
of
the
same
class
have
become
fused
into
one
this
view
then
presents
some
elements
of
probability
not
only
tammuz
but
most
of
his
variants
appear
to
possess
a
vegetable
significance
while
the
ishtar
type
is
open
to
interpretation
on
the
same
lines
thus
adonis
is
associated
with
the
from
whose
trunk
he
was
born
and
osiris
with
the
tamarisk
used
in
the
ritual
connected
with
his
cult
while
attis
after
his
death
became
a
tammuz
himself
was
conceived
of
as
dwelling
in
the
midst
of
a
great
whose
roots
extended
down
to
the
underworld
while
its
branches
reached
to
the
heavens
this
tree
appears
to
have
been
the
cedar
for
which
the
ancient
babylonians
had
an
especial
reverence
one
feature
which
leads
us
to
identify
the
deities
of
this
class
both
male
and
female
with
gods
of
vegetation
is
their
association
with
the
moon
osiris
is
regarded
and
with
much
reason
as
a
in
one
of
her
aspects
aphrodite
is
a
lunar
deity
while
a
like
significance
belongs
to
proserpine
and
to
the
ph
oe
nician
ashtoreth
ishtar
herself
it
is
true
was
never
identified
with
the
moon
which
in
babylonia
was
a
male
divinity
yet
she
was
associated
with
him
as
his
daughter
among
primitive
peoples
the
moon
is
believed
to
exercise
a
powerful
influence
on
vegetation
and
indeed
on
all
manner
of
growth
and
productivity
the
association
of
a
god
with
the
moon
therefore
argues
for
him
also
a
connexion
with
vegetation
and
fertility
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
a
lunar
significance
has
been
attached
by
some
authorities
to
the
story
of
ishtar
descent
into
hades
and
to
kindred
myths
it
is
held
that
the
sojourn
of
the
goddess
in
aralu
typifies
a
lunar
eclipse
or
perhaps
the
period
between
the
waning
of
the
old
moon
and
the
appearance
of
the
new
but
as
has
been
said
the
ancient
babylonians
saw
in
the
luminary
of
night
a
male
deity
so
that
any
lunar
characteristics
pertaining
to
ishtar
must
be
regarded
as
of
merely
secondary
importance
ishtar
tammuz
and
vegetation
if
it
be
granted
then
that
ishtar
and
tammuz
are
deities
of
vegetation
it
is
possible
still
further
to
narrow
their
sphere
by
associating
them
particularly
with
the
corn
adonis
and
aphrodite
are
connected
with
the
growth
of
the
crops
ceres
who
forbids
the
corn
to
spring
while
her
daughter
is
in
the
realm
of
pluto
is
undoubtedly
a
and
proserpine
evidently
partakes
of
the
same
nature
osiris
was
the
who
introduced
corn
into
egypt
a
representation
of
him
in
the
temple
of
isis
at
philæ
depicts
growing
out
of
his
dead
body
the
body
of
osiris
the
grain
is
torn
to
pieces
scattered
through
the
land
and
the
pieces
buried
or
planted
in
the
earth
when
the
corn
sprouts
from
it
moreover
tammuz
himself
was
cruelly
disposed
of
by
his
lord
who
ground
his
bones
in
a
mill
and
then
scattered
them
to
the
wind
plainly
a
type
of
the
treatment
meted
out
to
the
corn
an
arabic
writer
relates
that
tammuz
was
cruelly
killed
several
times
but
that
he
always
came
to
life
again
a
story
which
recalls
robert
burns
itself
perhaps
based
on
mythical
matter
may
not
these
examples
suggest
an
elucidation
on
animistic
lines
deities
of
the
tammuz
type
appear
to
symbolize
the
and
nothing
more
cut
down
bruised
and
beaten
buried
in
the
earth
and
finally
springing
to
renewed
life
who
then
are
the
goddesses
likewise
identified
with
the
corn
who
seek
in
the
underworld
for
lover
or
child
endeavouring
with
tears
to
ransom
the
corn
from
the
dark
earth
are
they
not
the
primitive
the
indwelling
animistic
spirits
of
the
standing
grain
doomed
at
the
harvest
to
wander
disconsolately
through
the
earth
till
the
sprouting
of
the
corn
once
more
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
materialize
the
stories
of
the
mutilation
and
dispersion
of
the
bodies
of
tammuz
and
osiris
and
of
the
many
deaths
of
the
former
god
furnish
a
basis
for
yet
another
explanation
of
the
tammuz
myth
sir
james
frazer
brings
forward
the
theory
that
the
of
the
ancient
babylonians
were
intended
not
for
mourning
for
the
decay
of
vegetation
but
to
bewail
the
cruel
treatment
of
the
grain
at
and
cites
in
this
connexion
the
ballad
of
which
we
are
told
was
based
on
an
early
english
poem
probably
itself
of
mythological
origin
it
is
however
most
likely
that
the
myth
of
tammuz
and
ishtar
is
of
a
composite
nature
as
has
already
been
indicated
possibly
a
myth
of
the
and
has
been
superimposed
on
the
early
groundwork
of
the
seeking
the
corn
it
would
certainly
seem
that
ishtar
in
her
descent
into
aralu
typified
the
earth
shorn
of
her
covering
of
vegetation
then
in
time
she
might
come
to
symbolize
the
vegetation
itself
or
the
fertility
which
produced
it
and
so
would
gain
new
attributes
and
new
elements
would
enter
into
the
myths
concerning
her
only
by
regarding
her
as
a
composite
deity
is
it
possible
to
reach
an
understanding
of
the
principles
underlying
these
myths
ishtar
and
esther
we
have
already
questioned
whether
the
scripture
story
of
esther
is
in
some
manner
connected
with
the
goddess
ishtar
writing
of
the
jewish
feast
of
purim
sir
james
frazer
says
vol
iii
from
the
absence
of
all
notice
of
purim
in
the
older
books
of
the
bible
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
the
festival
was
instituted
or
imported
at
a
comparatively
late
date
among
the
jews
the
same
conclusion
is
supported
by
the
book
of
esther
itself
which
was
manifestly
written
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
feast
and
to
suggest
motives
for
its
observance
for
according
to
the
author
of
the
book
the
festival
was
established
to
commemorate
the
deliverance
of
the
jews
from
a
great
danger
which
threatened
them
in
persia
under
the
reign
of
king
xerxes
thus
the
opinion
of
modern
scholars
that
the
feast
of
purim
as
celebrated
by
the
jews
was
of
late
date
and
oriental
origin
is
borne
out
by
the
tradition
of
the
jews
themselves
an
examination
of
that
tradition
and
of
the
mode
of
celebrating
the
feast
renders
it
probable
that
purim
is
nothing
but
a
more
or
less
disguised
form
of
the
babylonian
festival
of
the
sacæa
or
zakmuk
but
further
when
we
examine
the
narrative
which
professes
to
account
for
the
institution
of
purim
we
discover
in
it
not
only
the
strongest
traces
of
babylonian
origin
but
also
certain
singular
analogies
to
those
very
features
of
the
sacæan
festival
with
which
we
are
here
more
immediately
concerned
the
book
of
esther
turns
upon
the
fortunes
of
two
men
the
vizier
haman
and
the
despised
jew
mordecai
at
the
court
of
a
persian
king
mordecai
we
are
told
had
given
mortal
offence
to
the
vizier
who
accordingly
prepares
a
tall
gallows
on
which
he
hopes
to
see
his
enemy
hanged
while
he
himself
expects
to
receive
the
highest
mark
of
the
king
favour
by
being
allowed
to
wear
the
royal
crown
and
the
royal
robes
and
thus
attired
to
parade
the
streets
mounted
on
the
king
own
horse
and
attended
by
one
of
the
noblest
princes
who
should
proclaim
to
the
multitude
his
temporary
exaltation
and
glory
but
the
artful
intrigues
of
the
wicked
vizier
miscarried
and
resulted
in
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
he
had
hoped
and
expected
for
the
royal
honours
which
he
had
looked
for
fell
to
his
rival
mordecai
and
he
himself
was
hanged
on
the
gallows
which
he
had
made
ready
for
his
foe
in
this
story
we
seem
to
detect
a
reminiscence
more
or
less
confused
of
the
zoganes
of
the
sacæa
in
other
words
of
the
custom
of
investing
a
private
man
with
the
insignia
of
royalty
for
a
few
days
and
then
putting
him
to
death
on
the
gallows
or
the
cross
a
strong
confirmation
of
this
view
is
furnished
by
a
philological
analysis
of
the
names
of
the
four
personages
it
seems
to
be
now
generally
recognised
by
biblical
scholars
that
the
name
mordecai
which
has
no
meaning
in
hebrew
is
nothing
but
a
slightly
altered
form
of
marduk
or
merodach
the
name
of
the
chief
god
of
babylon
whose
great
festival
was
the
zakmuk
and
further
it
is
generally
admitted
that
esther
in
like
manner
is
equivalent
to
ishtar
the
great
babylonian
goddess
whom
the
greeks
called
astarte
and
who
is
more
familiar
to
english
readers
as
ashtaroth
the
derivation
of
the
names
of
haman
and
vashti
is
less
certain
but
some
high
authorities
are
disposed
to
accept
the
view
of
jensen
that
haman
is
identical
with
humman
or
homman
the
national
god
of
the
elamites
and
that
vashti
is
in
like
manner
an
elamite
deity
probably
a
goddess
whose
name
appears
in
inscriptions
lang
on
the
esther
story
commenting
on
this
theory
lang
in
his
and
says
the
name
mordecai
resembles
marduk
esther
is
like
ishtar
haman
is
like
humman
the
elamite
god
and
there
is
a
divine
name
in
the
inscriptions
read
as
resembling
and
probably
the
name
of
an
elamite
goddess
thus
the
human
characters
in
esther
are
in
peril
of
merging
in
babylonian
and
elamite
gods
but
lest
that
should
occur
we
ought
also
to
remember
that
mordecai
was
the
real
name
of
a
real
historical
jew
of
the
captivity
one
of
the
companions
of
nehemiah
in
the
return
from
exile
to
jerusalem
again
esther
appears
to
me
to
be
the
of
the
jewish
wife
of
xerxes
in
the
book
of
esther
that
is
esther
in
the
biblical
story
she
conceals
her
jewish
descent
hadassah
says
nöldeke
no
mere
invention
of
the
writer
of
esther
hadassah
is
said
to
mean
bough
and
girls
are
still
called
myrtle
esther
appears
to
have
been
an
assumed
name
after
a
royal
mixed
marriage
now
if
a
real
historical
jew
might
be
named
mordecai
which
we
know
to
be
the
case
a
jewess
whether
in
fact
or
in
this
book
of
esther
which
says
jastrow
of
course
some
historical
basis
might
be
styled
esther
but
if
mordecai
be
as
it
is
an
historical
name
of
a
real
jew
of
the
period
while
esther
may
be
and
probably
is
a
name
which
a
jewess
might
bear
it
is
not
ascertained
that
vashti
really
is
the
name
of
an
elamite
goddess
yet
vashti
is
quite
essential
as
a
goddess
to
argument
derivation
he
says
the
names
of
haman
and
vashti
is
less
certain
but
some
high
authorities
are
disposed
to
accept
the
view
of
jensen
that
haman
is
identical
with
humman
or
homman
the
national
god
of
the
elamites
and
that
vashti
is
in
like
manner
an
elamite
deity
probably
a
goddess
whose
name
appears
in
inscriptions
it
is
thus
seen
that
the
facts
regarding
these
names
make
such
an
explanation
as
is
advanced
by
sir
james
frazer
rather
a
hazardous
one
haman
according
to
his
theory
would
represent
the
dying
god
whilst
mordecai
would
play
the
part
of
the
god
of
vegetation
lang
puts
forward
a
and
that
is
that
haman
or
humman
was
a
conquering
god
of
the
elamites
which
accounts
for
him
having
been
whipped
and
hanged
in
derision
this
humman
was
he
thinks
possibly
an
elamite
god
of
vegetation
girsu
was
a
part
of
the
city
of
lagash
and
the
name
means
of
girsu
gods
frequently
had
lordship
over
a
city
quarter
one
of
the
instances
of
this
being
that
of
huitzilopochtli
who
ruled
over
that
part
of
the
city
of
tenochtitlan
called
mexico
which
afterwards
gave
its
name
to
the
entire
community
girsu
had
originally
been
a
city
itself
and
had
become
merged
into
lagash
so
its
god
was
probably
of
ancient
origin
is
frequently
alluded
to
as
warrior
of
bel
he
who
broke
through
the
hostile
ranks
to
aid
the
worshippers
of
the
great
god
of
the
netherworld
like
many
combatant
deities
however
he
presided
over
local
agriculture
and
in
this
connexion
he
was
known
as
of
the
corn
heaps
he
is
even
identified
with
tammuz
bau
in
ancient
inscriptions
especially
those
of
gudea
urbau
and
the
goddess
bau
is
alluded
to
as
the
great
mother
of
mankind
who
restores
the
sick
to
health
she
is
called
daughter
of
anu
and
seems
to
play
the
part
of
a
fate
to
some
extent
she
has
also
an
agricultural
side
to
her
character
gudea
was
especially
devoted
to
her
and
has
left
it
on
record
that
she
filled
him
with
eloquence
her
temple
was
at
a
quarter
of
lagash
and
as
the
goddess
of
that
neighbourhood
she
would
of
course
have
come
into
close
contact
with
indeed
she
is
spoken
of
as
his
consort
and
when
became
part
of
lagash
bau
was
promoted
as
tutelar
goddess
of
that
city
and
designated
of
lagash
she
has
been
identified
with
the
primeval
watery
depths
the
primitive
chaos
and
this
identification
has
been
founded
on
the
similarity
between
the
name
bau
and
the
hebrew
the
word
for
but
proof
is
wanting
to
support
the
conjecture
a
closely
allied
form
of
her
seems
to
be
a
goddess
who
has
probably
a
common
origin
with
bau
and
who
certainly
is
in
some
manner
connected
with
water
perhaps
with
the
clouds
nannar
nannar
was
the
of
ur
the
city
whence
came
abram
and
with
that
place
he
was
connected
much
as
was
shamash
with
sippar
that
is
to
say
ur
was
his
chief
but
not
his
only
centre
of
adoration
why
he
came
to
have
his
principal
seat
at
ur
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
the
name
ur
signifies
so
it
may
be
that
a
shrine
dedicated
to
nannar
existed
upon
the
site
of
this
city
and
constituted
its
nucleus
in
babylonian
mythology
the
sun
was
regarded
as
the
offspring
of
the
moon
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
this
conception
arose
in
the
minds
of
a
race
prone
to
astronomical
study
in
all
civilizations
the
lunar
method
of
computing
time
precedes
the
solar
the
phases
of
the
moon
are
regarded
as
more
trustworthy
and
more
easily
followed
than
the
more
obscure
changes
of
the
brighter
luminary
therefore
a
greater
degree
of
importance
was
attached
to
the
moon
in
very
early
times
than
to
the
sun
the
moon
is
usually
represented
on
babylonian
cylinders
as
bearing
a
crescent
upon
his
head
and
wearing
a
long
flowing
beard
described
as
of
the
colour
of
much
the
same
shade
as
his
beams
possess
in
warmer
latitudes
nannar
was
frequently
alluded
to
as
heifer
of
anu
because
of
the
horn
which
the
moon
displays
at
a
certain
phase
many
monarchs
appear
to
have
delighted
in
the
upkeep
and
restoration
of
his
temple
among
them
and
nannar
in
decay
but
as
happens
to
many
gods
nannar
became
confounded
with
some
earthly
hero
was
even
alluded
to
as
a
satrap
of
babylonia
under
the
median
monarch
artaios
a
personage
unknown
to
history
ctesias
hands
down
to
us
a
very
circumstantial
tale
concerning
him
as
follows
there
was
a
persian
of
the
name
of
parsondes
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
the
medes
an
eager
huntsman
and
an
active
warrior
on
foot
and
in
the
chariot
distinguished
in
council
and
in
the
field
and
of
influence
with
the
king
parsondes
often
urged
the
king
to
make
him
satrap
of
babylon
in
the
place
of
nannaros
who
wore
women
clothes
and
ornaments
but
the
king
always
put
the
petition
aside
for
it
could
not
be
granted
without
breaking
the
promise
which
his
ancestor
had
made
to
belesys
nannaros
discovered
the
intentions
of
parsondes
and
sought
to
secure
himself
against
them
and
to
take
vengeance
he
promised
great
rewards
to
the
cooks
who
were
in
the
train
of
the
king
if
they
succeeded
in
seizing
parsondes
and
giving
him
up
one
day
parsondes
in
the
heat
of
the
chase
strayed
far
from
the
king
he
had
already
killed
many
boars
and
deer
when
the
pursuit
of
a
wild
ass
carried
him
to
a
great
distance
at
last
he
came
upon
the
cooks
who
were
occupied
in
preparations
for
the
king
table
being
thirsty
parsondes
asked
for
wine
they
gave
it
took
care
of
his
horse
and
invited
him
to
take
food
an
invitation
agreeable
to
parsondes
who
had
been
hunting
the
whole
day
he
bade
them
send
the
ass
which
he
had
captured
to
the
king
and
tell
his
own
servants
where
he
was
then
he
ate
of
the
various
kinds
of
food
set
before
him
and
drank
abundantly
of
the
excellent
wine
and
at
last
asked
for
his
horse
in
order
to
return
to
the
king
but
they
brought
beautiful
women
to
him
and
urged
him
to
remain
for
the
night
he
agreed
and
as
soon
as
overcome
by
hunting
wine
and
love
he
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
the
cooks
bound
him
and
brought
him
to
nannaros
nannaros
reproached
parsondes
with
calling
him
an
effeminate
man
and
seeking
to
obtain
his
satrapy
he
had
the
king
to
thank
that
the
satrapy
granted
to
his
ancestors
had
not
been
taken
from
him
parsondes
replied
that
he
considered
himself
more
worthy
of
the
office
because
he
was
more
manly
and
more
useful
to
the
king
but
nannaros
swore
by
bel
and
mylitta
that
parsondes
should
be
softer
and
whiter
than
a
woman
called
for
the
eunuch
who
was
over
the
female
players
and
bade
him
shave
the
body
of
parsondes
and
bathe
and
anoint
him
every
day
put
women
clothes
on
him
plait
his
hair
after
the
manner
of
women
paint
his
face
and
place
him
among
the
women
who
played
the
guitar
and
sang
that
he
might
learn
their
arts
this
was
done
and
soon
parsondes
played
and
sang
better
at
the
table
of
nannaros
than
any
of
the
women
meanwhile
the
king
of
the
medes
had
caused
search
to
be
made
everywhere
for
parsondes
and
since
he
could
nowhere
be
found
and
nothing
could
be
heard
of
him
he
believed
that
a
lion
or
some
other
wild
animal
had
killed
him
when
out
hunting
and
lamented
for
his
loss
parsondes
had
lived
for
seven
years
as
a
woman
in
babylon
when
nannaros
caused
a
eunuch
to
be
scourged
and
grievously
maltreated
this
eunuch
parsondes
induced
by
large
presents
to
retire
to
media
and
tell
the
king
the
misfortune
which
had
come
upon
him
then
the
king
sent
a
message
commanding
nannaros
to
give
up
parsondes
nannaros
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
him
but
the
king
sent
a
second
messenger
with
orders
to
put
nannaros
to
death
if
he
did
not
surrender
parsondes
nannaros
entertained
the
messenger
of
the
king
and
when
the
meal
was
brought
women
entered
of
whom
some
played
the
guitar
while
others
blew
the
flute
at
the
end
of
the
meal
nannaros
asked
the
king
envoy
which
of
all
the
women
was
the
most
beautiful
and
had
played
best
the
envoy
pointed
to
parsondes
nannaros
laughed
long
and
said
is
the
person
whom
you
seek
and
released
parsondes
who
on
the
next
day
returned
home
with
the
envoy
to
the
king
in
a
chariot
the
king
was
astonished
at
the
sight
of
him
and
asked
why
he
had
not
avoided
such
disgrace
by
death
parsondes
answered
order
that
i
might
see
you
again
and
by
you
execute
vengeance
on
nannaros
which
could
never
have
been
mine
had
i
taken
my
life
the
king
promised
him
that
his
hope
should
be
realized
as
soon
as
he
came
to
babylon
but
when
he
came
there
nannaros
defended
himself
on
the
ground
that
parsondes
though
in
no
way
injured
by
him
had
maligned
him
and
sought
to
obtain
the
satrapy
over
babylonia
the
king
pointed
out
that
he
had
made
himself
judge
in
his
own
cause
and
had
imposed
a
punishment
of
a
degrading
character
in
ten
days
he
would
pronounce
judgment
upon
him
for
his
conduct
in
terror
nannaros
hastened
to
mitraphernes
the
eunuch
of
greatest
influence
with
the
king
and
promised
him
the
most
liberal
rewards
talents
of
gold
and
talents
of
silver
golden
and
silver
bowls
if
he
could
induce
the
king
to
spare
his
life
and
retain
him
in
the
satrapy
of
babylonia
he
was
prepared
to
give
the
king
talents
of
gold
talents
of
silver
golden
and
silver
bowls
and
costly
robes
with
other
gifts
parsondes
also
should
receive
talents
of
silver
and
costly
robes
after
many
entreaties
mitraphernes
persuaded
the
king
not
to
order
the
execution
of
nannaros
as
he
had
not
killed
parsondes
but
to
exact
from
him
the
compensation
which
he
was
prepared
to
pay
parsondes
and
the
king
nannaros
in
gratitude
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
king
but
parsondes
said
be
the
man
who
first
brought
gold
among
men
for
the
sake
of
gold

it
is
impossible
to
say
what
the
mythological
meaning
hidden
in
this
tale
may
portend
we
have
the
attempting
to
feminize
an
unfortunate

does
this

parsondes
came
under
the
influence

aralu
or
the
deities
of
the
underworld
of
the
region
of
the
dead
are
usually
of
later
origin
than
those
of
the
heavens
they
are
frequently
the
gods
of
an
older
and
discredited
religion
and
are
relegated
to
the
shades
of
opposition
dwelling
there
just
as
the
dead
are
supposed
to
in
the
grave
a
legend
exists
regarding
aralu
which
was
discovered
among
other
texts
at
the
story
goes
that
the
gods
once
gave
a
feast
to
which
they
invited
aralu
apologizing
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
unable
to
go
down
to
her
and
regretting
that
she
could
not
ascend
to
them
in
their
dilemma
they
requested
her
to
send
a
messenger
to
bring
to
her
the
viands
which
fell
to
her
share
she
complied
with
the
request
and
when
the
messenger
arrived
all
the
gods
stood
up
to
do
him
honour
for
his
mistress
sake
all
save
nergal
the
messenger
acquainted
aralu
with
this
slight
and
greatly
enraged
she
sent
him
back
to
the
dwelling
of
the
gods
to
ask
that
the
delinquent
might
be
delivered
into
her
hands
so
that
she
might
slay
him
the
gods
after
some
discussion
requested
the
messenger
to
take
back
him
who
had
offended
the
dark
goddess
and
in
order
that
the
envoy
might
the
more
easily
discover
him
all
the
gods
were
gathered
together
but
nergal
remained
in
the
background
his
absence
was
discovered
however
and
he
was
despatched
to
the
gloomy
realm
of
aralu
but
he
had
no
mind
to
taste
death
indeed
aralu
found
the
tables
turned
for
nergal
seizing
her
by
the
hair
dragged
her
from
her
throne
and
prepared
to
cut
off
her
head
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
speak
and
upon
her
request
being
granted
she
offered
herself
as
a
wife
to
her
conqueror
along
with
the
dominions
over
which
she
held
sway
nergal
assented
to
her
proposals
and
they
were
nergal
is
the
sun
which
passes
through
the
gloomy
underworld
at
night
just
as
does
osiris
and
in
this
character
he
has
to
conquer
the
powers
of
death
and
the
grave
it
is
rare
however
to
find
the
allying
himself
by
marriage
to
one
of
the
infernal
powers
although
in
the
central
american
one
of
the
explorers
to
the
underworld
weds
the
daughter
of
one
of
its
overlords
and
persephone
the
is
forced
to
become
the
spouse
of
the
lord
of
hades
dagon
dagon
alluded
to
in
the
scriptures
was
like
oannes
a
besides
being
worshipped
in
erech
and
its
neighbourhood
he
was
adored
in
palestine
and
on
occasion
among
the
hebrews
themselves
but
it
was
in
the
extreme
south
of
palestine
that
his
worship
attained
its
chief
importance
he
had
temples
at
ashdod
and
gaza
and
perhaps
his
worship
travelled
westward
along
with
that
of
ishtar
both
were
worshipped
at
erech
and
where
the
cult
of
the
one
penetrated
it
is
likely
that
there
would
be
found
the
rites
of
the
other
dagon
his
name
upward
man
and
downward
fish
as
milton
expresses
it
affords
one
of
the
most
dramatic
instances
in
the
old
testament
of
the
downfall
of
a
usurping
idol
and
the
philistines
took
the
ark
of
god
and
brought
it
from
unto
ashdod
when
the
philistines
took
the
ark
of
god
they
brought
it
into
the
house
of
dagon
and
set
it
by
dagon
and
when
they
of
ashdod
arose
early
on
the
morrow
behold
dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
earth
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
they
took
dagon
and
set
him
in
his
place
again
and
when
they
arose
early
on
the
morrow
morning
behold
dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
the
head
of
dagon
and
both
the
palms
of
his
hands
were
cut
off
upon
the
threshold
only
the
stump
of
dagon
was
left
to
him
therefore
neither
the
priests
of
dagon
nor
any
that
come
into
house
tread
on
the
threshold
of
dagon
in
ashdod
unto
this
day
but
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
heavy
upon
them
of
ashdod
and
he
destroyed
them
and
smote
them
with
emerods
even
ashdod
and
the
coasts
thereof
and
when
the
men
of
ashdod
saw
that
it
was
so
they
said
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
shall
not
abide
with
us
for
his
hand
is
sore
upon
us
and
upon
dagon
our
god
thus
in
the
bible
story
only
the
or
fish
tail
of
dagon
was
left
to
him
in
some
of
the
ninevite
sculptures
of
this
deity
the
head
of
the
fish
forms
a
kind
of
mitre
on
the
head
of
the
man
while
the
body
of
the
fish
appears
as
a
cloak
or
cape
over
his
shoulders
and
back
this
is
a
sure
sign
to
the
mythological
student
that
a
god
so
adorned
is
in
process
of
quitting
the
animal
for
the
human
form
nirig
or
this
deity
is
alluded
to
in
an
inscription
as
the
eldest
of
the
gods
he
was
especially
favoured
by
the
kings
of
assyria
and
we
find
his
name
entering
into
the
composition
of
several
of
their
texts
in
a
certain
poem
he
is
called
the
son
of
bel
and
is
described
as
being
made
in
the
likeness
of
anu
he
rides
it
is
said
against
the
gods
of
his
enemies
in
a
chariot
of
and
his
onset
is
full
of
the
fury
of
the
tempest
bel
his
father
commands
him
to
set
forth
for
the
temple
of
bel
at
nippur
here
nusku
the
messenger
of
bel
meets
him
bestows
a
gift
upon
him
and
humbly
requests
that
he
will
not
disturb
the
god
bel
his
father
in
his
nor
terrify
the
it
would
appear
from
this
passage
that
nirig
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
place
of
bel
his
father
but
that
he
ever
did
so
is
improbable
as
a
deity
of
storm
he
is
also
a
god
of
war
but
he
was
the
upon
the
mountains
therefore
he
had
also
an
agricultural
significance
it
is
strange
that
in
babylonia
possess
the
same
functions
and
attributes
those
of
war
and
agriculture
as
do
rain
or
thunder
or
or
wind
and
rain
deities
circumstance
which
is
eloquent
of
the
power
of
climatic
conditions
in
the
manufacture
of
myth
in
mesopotamia
fierce
must
have
given
the
people
the
idea
of
a
savage
and
intractable
deity
destructive
rather
than
beneficent
as
many
hymns
and
kindred
texts
witness
we
have
now
briefly
examined
the
elder
gods
of
the
babylonian
pantheon
other
and
in
some
cases
more
imposing
gods
were
yet
to
be
adopted
by
the
babylonians
as
we
shall
see
in
the
following
chapters
the
passage
is
quoted
by
kind
permission
of
messrs
a
black
belief
in
babylonia
and
polyhistor
is
still
speaking
the
passage
is
somewhat
obscure
and
of
course
relates
to
the
myth
of
merodach
and
tiawath

merodach
and
the

these
deities
of

must
not
be
confounded
with
the
gods
of

chapter
iv
the
gilgamesh
epic
as
it
is
probable
that
the
materials
of
the
gilgamesh
epic
the
great
mythological
poem
of
babylonia
originally
belong
to
the
older
epoch
of
babylonian
mythology
it
is
fitting
that
it
should
be
described
and
considered
before
passing
to
the
later
developments
of
chaldean
religion
the
gilgamesh
epic
ranks
with
the
babylonian
myth
of
creation
as
one
of
the
greatest
literary
productions
of
ancient
babylonia
the
main
element
in
its
composition
is
a
conglomeration
of
mythic
matter
drawn
from
various
sources
with
perhaps
a
substratum
of
historic
fact
the
whole
being
woven
into
a
continuous
narrative
around
the
central
figure
of
gilgamesh
prince
of
erech
it
is
not
possible
at
present
to
fix
the
date
when
the
epic
was
first
written
our
knowledge
of
it
is
gleaned
chiefly
from
mutilated
fragments
belonging
to
the
library
of
but
from
internal
and
other
evidence
we
gather
that
some
at
least
of
the
traditions
embodied
in
the
epic
are
of
much
greater
antiquity
than
his
reign
thus
a
tablet
dated
contains
a
variant
of
the
deluge
story
inserted
in
the
xith
tablet
of
the
gilgamesh
epic
probably
this
and
other
portions
of
the
epic
existed
in
oral
tradition
before
they
were
committed
to
writing
that
is
in
the
remote
sumerian
period
was
an
enthusiastic
and
practical
patron
of
literature
in
his
great
library
at
nineveh
the
nucleus
of
which
had
been
taken
from
calah
by
sennacherib
he
had
gathered
a
vast
collection
of
volumes
clay
tablets
and
papyri
most
of
which
had
been
carried
as
spoil
from
conquered
lands
he
also
employed
scribes
to
copy
older
texts
and
this
is
evidently
how
the
existing
edition
of
the
gilgamesh
epic
came
to
be
written
from
the
fragments
now
in
the
british
museum
it
would
seem
that
at
least
four
copies
of
the
poem
were
made
in
the
time
of
they
were
not
long
permitted
to
remain
undisturbed
the
great
assyrian
empire
was
already
declining
ere
long
nineveh
was
captured
and
its
library
scattered
while
plundering
hordes
burnt
the
precious
rolls
of
papyrus
and
buried
the
clay
tablets
in
the
debris
of
the
palace
which
had
sheltered
them
there
they
were
destined
to
lie
for
over
years
till
the
excavations
of
sir
layard
george
smith
and
others
brought
them
to
light
it
is
true
that
the
twelve
tablets
of
the
gilgamesh
epic
or
rather
the
fragments
of
them
which
have
so
far
been
discovered
are
much
defaced
frequently
the
entire
sense
of
a
passage
is
obscured
by
a
gap
in
the
text
and
this
when
nice
mythological
elucidations
are
in
question
is
no
light
matter
yet
to
such
an
extent
has
the
science
of
comparative
religion
progressed
in
recent
years
that
we
are
probably
better
able
to
read
the
true
mythological
significance
of
the
epic
than
were
the
ancient
babylonians
themselves
who
saw
in
it
merely
an
account
of
the
wanderings
and
exploits
of
a
national
hero
the
epic
which
centres
round
the
ancient
city
of
erech
relates
the
adventures
of
a
hero
gilgamesh
by
name
who
is
king
over
erech
two
other
characters
figure
prominently
in
the
narrative
eabani
who
evidently
typifies
primitive
man
and
the
hero
of
the
babylonian
deluge
myth
each
of
the
three
would
seem
to
have
been
originally
the
hero
of
a
separate
group
of
traditions
which
in
time
became
incorporated
more
or
less
naturally
with
the
other
two
the
first
and
most
important
of
the
trio
the
hero
gilgamesh
may
have
been
at
one
time
a
real
personage
though
nothing
is
known
of
him
historically
possibly
the
exploits
of
some
ancient
king
of
erech
have
furnished
a
basis
for
the
narrative
his
name
for
a
time
provisionally
read
or
but
now
known
to
have
been
pronounced
suggests
that
he
was
not
babylonian
but
elamite
or
kassite
in
origin
and
from
indications
furnished
by
the
poem
itself
we
learn
that
he
conquered
erech
or
relieved
the
city
from
a
besieging
force
at
the
outset
of
his
adventurous
career
it
has
been
suggested
also
that
he
was
identical
with
the
biblical
nimrod
like
him
a
hero
of
ancient
babylon
but
there
are
no
other
grounds
for
the
suggestion
so
much
for
the
historical
aspect
of
gilgamesh
his
mythological
character
is
more
easily
established
in
this
regard
he
is
the
personification
of
the
sun
he
represents
in
fact
the
fusion
of
a
great
national
hero
with
a
mythical
being
throughout
the
epic
there
are
indications
that
gilgamesh
is
partly
divine
by
nature
though
nothing
specific
is
said
on
that
head
his
identity
with
the
solar
god
is
veiled
in
the
popular
narrative
but
it
is
evident
that
he
has
some
connexion
with
the
god
shamash
to
whom
he
pays
his
devotions
and
who
acts
as
his
patron
and
protector
the
birth
of
gilgamesh
among
the
traditions
concerning
his
birth
is
one
related
by
ælian
xii
of
gilgamos
gilgamesh
the
grandson
of
sokkaros
sokkaros
who
according
to
berossus
was
the
first
king
to
reign
in
babylonia
after
the
deluge
was
warned
by
means
of
divination
that
his
daughter
should
bear
a
son
who
would
deprive
him
of
his
throne
thinking
to
frustrate
the
designs
of
fate
he
shut
her
up
in
a
tower
where
she
was
closely
watched
but
in
time
she
bore
a
son
and
her
attendants
knowing
how
wroth
the
king
would
be
to
learn
of
the
event
flung
the
child
from
the
tower
but
before
he
reached
the
ground
an
eagle
seized
him
up
and
bore
him
off
to
a
certain
garden
where
he
was
duly
found
and
cared
for
by
a
peasant
and
when
he
grew
to
manhood
he
became
king
of
the
babylonians
having
presumably
usurped
the
throne
of
his
grandfather
here
we
have
a
myth
obviously
of
solar
significance
conforming
in
every
particular
to
a
definite
type
of
it
can
not
have
been
by
chance
that
it
became
attached
to
the
person
of
gilgamesh
everything
in
the
epic
too
is
consonant
with
the
belief
that
gilgamesh
is
a
his
connexion
with
shamash
who
may
have
been
his
father
in
the
tradition
given
by
ælian
as
well
as
the
eagle
which
saved
him
from
death
the
fact
that
no
mention
is
made
of
his
father
in
the
poem
though
his
mother
is
brought
in
more
than
once
and
the
assumption
throughout
the
epic
that
he
is
more
than
human
given
the
key
to
his
mythical
character
it
is
not
hard
to
perceive
in
his
adventures
the
daily
or
annual
course
of
the
sun
rising
to
its
full
strength
at
noonday
or
and
sinking
at
length
to
the
western
horizon
to
return
in
due
time
to
the
abode
of
men
like
all
solar
deities
like
the
sun
itself
his
birth
and
origin
are
wrapped
in
mystery
he
is
indeed
one
of
the
children
like
sargon
perseus
or
arthur
when
he
first
appears
in
the
narrative
he
is
already
a
hero
the
ruler
and
it
would
seem
oppressor
of
erech
his
mother
is
a
priestess
in
the
temple
of
ishtar
and
through
her
he
is
descended
from
a
native
of
shurippak
and
the
hero
of
the
babylonian
early
in
the
narrative
he
is
brought
into
contact
with
the
wild
man
eabani
originally
designed
for
his
destruction
by
the
gods
but
with
whom
he
eventually
concludes
a
firm
friendship
the
pair
proceed
to
do
battle
with
the
monster
khumbaba
whom
they
overcome
as
they
do
also
the
sacred
bull
sent
against
them
by
anu
up
to
the
end
of
the
vith
tablet
their
conquering
and
triumphant
career
is
without
interruption
gilgamesh
increases
in
strength
as
does
the
sun
approaching
the
zenith
at
the
viith
tablet
however
his
good
fortune
begins
to
wane
eabani
dies
slain
doubtless
by
the
wrath
of
ishtar
whose
love
gilgamesh
has
rejected
with
scorn
and
the
hero
mourning
the
death
of
his
friend
and
smitten
with
fear
that
he
himself
will
perish
in
like
manner
decides
to
go
in
search
of
his
ancestor
who
as
sole
survivor
of
the
deluge
has
received
from
the
gods
deification
and
immortality
and
learn
of
him
the
secret
of
eternal
life
his
further
adventures
have
not
the
triumphal
character
of
his
earlier
exploits
sunwise
he
journeys
to
the
mountain
of
the
sunset
encounters
the
and
crosses
the
waters
of
death
teaches
him
the
lesson
that
all
men
must
die
he
himself
being
an
exception
in
exceptional
circumstances
and
though
he
afterwards
gives
gilgamesh
an
opportunity
of
eating
the
plant
of
life
the
opportunity
is
lost
however
cures
gilgamesh
of
a
disease
which
he
has
contracted
apparently
while
crossing
the
waters
of
death
and
he
is
finally
restored
to
erech
in
these
happenings
we
see
the
gradual
sinking
of
the
sun
into
the
underworld
by
way
of
the
mountain
of
the
sunset
it
is
impossible
for
the
sun
to
attain
immortality
to
remain
for
ever
in
the
land
of
the
living
he
must
traverse
the
waters
of
death
and
sojourn
in
the
underworld
yet
the
return
of
gilgamesh
to
erech
signifies
the
fresh
dawning
of
the
day
it
is
the
eternal
struggle
of
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
darkness
may
conquer
light
but
light
will
emerge
again
victorious
the
contest
is
unending
some
authorities
have
seen
in
the
division
of
the
epic
into
twelve
tablets
a
connexion
with
the
months
of
the
year
or
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
such
a
connexion
probably
exists
but
when
we
consider
that
the
artificial
division
of
the
epic
into
tablets
scarcely
tallies
with
the
natural
divisions
of
the
poem
it
seems
likely
that
the
astrological
significance
of
the
former
was
given
to
the
epic
by
the
scribes
of
nineveh
who
were
evidently
at
some
pains
to
compress
the
matter
into
twelve
tablets
of
the
significance
of
the
narrative
itself
one
of
its
most
important
aspects
we
shall
perhaps
be
better
able
to
judge
when
we
have
considered
it
in
detail
eabani
the
most
important
of
the
various
mythological
strata
underlying
the
gilgamesh
myth
is
probably
that
concerning
eabani
who
as
has
been
said
is
a
type
of
primitive
man
living
among
the
beasts
of
the
field
as
one
of
themselves
but
he
is
also
according
to
certain
authorities
a
form
of
the
even
as
gilgamesh
himself
like
the
hero
of
erech
he
rises
to
the
zenith
of
his
powers
in
a
triumphal
progress
then
descends
into
the
underworld
he
is
not
lost
sight
of
however
but
lives
in
the
memory
of
his
friend
gilgamesh
and
in
the
xiith
tablet
he
is
temporarily
brought
forth
from
the
underworld
that
is
his
ghost
or
which
in
a
dim
and
shadowy
fashion
may
typify
the
daily
restoration
of
the
sun
another
important
stratum
of
myth
is
that
which
concerns
the
babylonian
noah
but
whereas
the
myths
of
eabani
and
gilgamesh
though
still
distinguishable
have
become
thoroughly
fused
the
deluge
story
of
which
is
the
hero
has
been
inserted
bodily
into
the
xith
tablet
of
the
epic
being
related
to
gilgamesh
by
himself
when
he
first
appears
in
the
narrative
he
has
the
attributes
and
powers
of
a
god
having
received
these
for
his
fidelity
to
the
gods
during
the
flood
from
whose
waters
he
alone
of
all
mankind
escaped
the
object
of
his
narrative
in
the
gilgamesh
epic
seems
to
be
to
point
out
to
the
hero
that
only
the
most
exceptional
circumstances
unique
circumstances
indeed
can
save
man
from
his
doom
other
distinct
portions
of
the
epic
are
the
battle
with
the
monster
khumbaba
the
episode
of
ishtar
love
for
gilgamesh
the
fight
with
the
sacred
bull
of
anu
and
the
search
for
the
plant
of
life
these
whatever
their
origin
have
become
naturally
incorporated
with
the
story
of
gilgamesh
but
besides
the
various
historical
and
mythical
elements
herein
presented
there
is
also
a
certain
amount
of
babylonian
religious
doctrine
evident
to
some
extent
in
the
xith
tablet
which
points
the
moral
that
all
men
must
die
but
doubly
so
in
the
xiith
tablet
wherein
the
shade
of
eabani
appears
to
gilgamesh
relates
the
misfortunes
of
the
unburied
dead
or
of
those
uncared
for
after
death
and
inculcates
care
for
the
deceased
as
the
only
means
whereby
they
may
evade
the
grievous
woes
which
threaten
them
in
the
underworld
let
us
examine
in
detail
the
gilgamesh
epic
as
we
have
it
in
the
broken
fragments
which
remain
to
us
the
ist
and
iind
tablets
are
much
mutilated
a
number
of
fragments
are
extant
which
belong
to
one
or
other
of
these
two
but
it
is
not
easy
to
say
where
the
ist
ends
and
the
iind
begins
one
fragment
would
seem
to
contain
the
very
beginning
of
the
ist
tablet
a
sort
of
general
preface
to
the
epic
comprising
a
list
of
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
reading
it
after
this
comes
a
fragment
whose
title
to
inclusion
in
the
epic
is
doubtful
it
describes
a
siege
of
the
city
of
erech
but
makes
no
mention
of
gilgamesh
the
woeful
condition
of
erech
under
the
siege
is
thus
picturesquely
detailed
she
asses
tread
down
their
young
cows
turn
upon
their
calves
men
cry
aloud
like
beasts
and
maidens
mourn
like
doves
the
gods
of
erech
are
changed
to
flies
and
buzz
about
the
streets
the
spirits
of
erech
are
changed
to
serpents
and
glide
into
holes
for
three
years
the
enemy
besieged
erech
and
the
doors
were
barred
and
the
bolts
were
shot
and
ishtar
did
not
raise
her
head
against
the
foe
if
this
fragment
be
indeed
a
portion
of
the
gilgamesh
epic
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
whether
gilgamesh
was
the
besieger
or
the
raiser
of
the
siege
or
whether
he
was
concerned
in
the
affair
at
all
gilgamesh
as
tyrant
now
we
come
to
the
real
commencement
of
the
poem
inscribed
on
a
fragment
which
some
authorities
assign
to
the
beginning
of
the
iind
tablet
but
which
more
probably
forms
a
part
of
the
ist
in
this
portion
we
find
gilgamesh
filling
the
double
rôle
of
ruler
and
oppressor
of
erech
the
latter
evidently
not
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
a
hero
there
is
no
mention
here
of
a
siege
nor
is
there
any
record
of
the
coming
of
gilgamesh
though
as
has
been
indicated
he
probably
came
as
a
conqueror
his
intolerable
tyranny
towards
the
people
of
erech
lends
colour
to
this
view
he
presses
the
young
men
into
his
service
in
the
building
of
a
great
wall
and
carries
off
the
fairest
maidens
to
his
court
he
hath
not
left
the
son
to
his
father
nor
the
maid
to
the
hero
nor
the
wife
to
her
husband
finally
his
harshness
constrained
the
people
to
appeal
to
the
gods
and
they
prayed
the
goddess
aruru
to
create
a
mighty
hero
who
would
champion
their
cause
and
through
fear
of
whom
gilgamesh
should
be
forced
to
temper
his
severity
the
gods
themselves
added
their
prayers
to
those
of
the
oppressed
people
and
aruru
at
length
agreed
to
create
a
champion
against
gilgamesh
upon
hearing
these
words
so
runs
the
narrative
aruru
conceived
a
man
in
the
image
of
anu
in
her
mind
aruru
washed
her
hands
she
broke
off
a
piece
of
clay
she
cast
it
on
the
ground
thus
she
created
eabani
the
hero
when
the
creation
of
this
champion
was
finished
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
wild
man
of
the
mountains
the
whole
of
his
body
was
covered
with
hair
he
was
clothed
with
long
hair
like
a
woman
his
hair
was
luxuriant
like
that
of
the
he
knew
not
the
land
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
he
was
clothed
with
garments
as
the
god
of
the
field
with
the
gazelles
he
ate
herbs
with
the
beasts
he
slaked
his
thirst
with
the
creatures
of
the
water
his
heart
rejoiced
in
pictorial
representations
on
and
elsewhere
eabani
is
depicted
as
a
sort
of
satyr
with
the
head
arms
and
body
of
a
man
and
the
horns
ears
and
legs
of
a
beast
as
we
have
seen
he
is
a
type
of
a
sort
of
caliban
ranging
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
utterly
ignorant
of
the
things
of
civilization

belief
and
practice
in
babylonia
and
by
professor
morris
by
permission
of
messrs
putnam
sons
the
beguiling
of
eabani
the
poem
goes
on
to
introduce
a
new
character
tsaidu
the
hunter
apparently
designed
by
the
gods
to
bring
about
the
meeting
of
gilgamesh
and
eabani
how
he
first
encounters
eabani
is
not
quite
clear
from
the
mutilated
text
one
reading
has
it
that
the
king
of
erech
learning
the
plan
of
the
gods
for
his
overthrow
sent
tsaidu
into
the
mountains
in
search
of
eabani
with
instructions
to
entrap
him
by
whatever
means
and
bring
him
to
erech
another
reading
describes
the
encounter
as
purely
accidental
however
this
may
be
tsaidu
returned
to
erech
and
related
to
gilgamesh
the
story
of
his
encounter
telling
him
of
the
strength
and
fleetness
of
the
wild
man
and
his
exceeding
shyness
at
the
sight
of
a
human
being
by
this
time
it
is
evident
that
gilgamesh
knows
or
conjectures
the
purpose
for
which
eabani
is
designed
and
intends
to
frustrate
the
divine
plans
by
anticipating
the
meeting
between
himself
and
the
wild
man
accordingly
he
bids
tsaidu
return
to
the
mountains
taking
with
him
ukhut
one
of
the
sacred
women
of
the
temple
of
ishtar
his
plan
is
that
ukhut
with
her
wiles
shall
persuade
eabani
to
return
with
her
to
erech
thus
the
hunter
and
the
girl
set
out
they
took
the
straight
road
and
on
the
third
day
they
reached
the
usual
of
eabani
then
tsaidu
and
the
woman
placed
themselves
in
hiding
for
one
day
for
two
days
they
lurked
by
the
with
the
beasts
eabani
slaked
his
thirst
with
the
creatures
of
the
waters
his
heart
rejoiced
then
eabani
approached
the
scene
which
follows
is
described
at
some
length
ukhut
had
no
difficulty
in
enthralling
eabani
with
the
snares
of
her
beauty
for
six
days
and
seven
nights
he
remembered
nothing
because
of
his
love
for
her
when
at
length
he
bethought
him
of
his
gazelles
his
flocks
and
herds
he
found
that
they
would
no
longer
follow
him
as
before
so
he
sat
at
the
feet
of
ukhut
while
she
told
him
of
erech
and
its
king
thou
art
handsome
o
eabani
thou
art
like
a
god
why
dost
thou
traverse
the
plain
with
the
beasts
come
i
will
take
thee
to
erech
to
the
bright
palace
the
dwelling
of
anu
and
ishtar
to
the
palace
of
gilgamesh
the
perfect
in
strength
who
like
a
wieldeth
power
over
man
eabani
found
the
prospect
delightful
he
longed
for
the
friendship
of
gilgamesh
and
declared
himself
willing
to
follow
the
woman
to
the
city
of
erech
and
so
ukhut
eabani
and
tsaidu
set
out
on
their
journey
gilgamesh
meets
eabani
the
feast
of
ishtar
was
in
progress
when
they
reached
erech
eabani
had
conceived
the
idea
that
he
must
do
battle
with
gilgamesh
before
he
could
claim
that
hero
as
a
friend
but
being
warned
whether
in
a
dream
or
by
ukhut
is
not
clear
that
gilgamesh
was
stronger
than
he
and
withal
a
favourite
of
the
gods
he
wisely
refrained
from
combat
meanwhile
gilgamesh
also
had
dreamed
a
dream
which
interpreted
by
his
mother
foretold
the
coming
of
eabani
that
part
of
the
poem
which
deals
with
the
meeting
of
gilgamesh
and
eabani
is
unfortunately
no
longer
extant
but
from
the
fragments
which
take
up
the
broken
narrative
we
gather
that
they
met
and
became
friends
the
portions
of
the
epic
next
in
order
appear
to
belong
to
the
iind
tablet
in
these
we
find
eabani
lamenting
the
loss
of
his
former
freedom
and
showering
maledictions
on
the
who
has
lured
him
thither
however
shamash
the
intervenes
perhaps
in
another
dream
or
vision
these
play
a
prominent
part
in
the
narrative
and
showing
him
the
benefits
he
has
derived
from
his
sojourn
in
the
haunts
of
civilization
endeavours
with
various
promises
and
inducements
to
make
him
stay
in
erech
now
gilgamesh
thy
friend
and
brother
shall
give
thee
a
great
couch
to
sleep
on
shall
give
thee
a
couch
carefully
prepared
shall
give
thee
a
seat
at
his
left
hand
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
shall
kiss
thy
feet
with
this
apparently
eabani
is
satisfied
he
ceases
to
bewail
his
position
at
erech
and
accepts
his
destiny
with
calmness
in
the
remaining
fragments
of
the
tablet
we
find
him
concerned
about
another
dream
or
vision
and
before
this
portion
of
the
epic
closes
the
heroes
have
planned
an
expedition
against
the
monster
khumbaba
guardian
of
the
abode
of
the
goddess
irnina
a
form
of
ishtar
in
the
forest
of
cedars
in
the
very
mutilated
iiird
tablet
the
two
heroes
go
to
consult
the
priestess
the
mother
of
gilgamesh
and
through
her
they
ask
protection
from
shamash
in
the
forthcoming
expedition
the
old
priestess
advises
her
son
and
his
friend
how
to
proceed
and
after
they
have
gone
we
see
her
alone
in
the
temple
her
hands
raised
to
the
invoking
his
blessing
on
gilgamesh
why
hast
thou
troubled
the
heart
of
my
son
gilgamesh
thou
hast
laid
thy
hand
upon
him
and
he
goeth
away
on
a
far
journey
to
the
dwelling
of
khumbaba
he
entereth
into
a
combat
whose
issue
he
knoweth
not
he
followeth
a
road
unknown
to
him
till
he
arrive
and
till
he
return
till
he
reach
the
forest
of
cedars
till
he
hath
slain
the
terrible
khumbaba
and
rid
the
land
of
all
the
evil
that
thou
hatest
till
the
day
of
his
return
let
aya
thy
betrothed
thy
splendour
recall
him
to
thee
with
this
dignified
and
beautiful
appeal
the
tablet
comes
to
an
end
the
monster
khumbaba
the
ivth
tablet
is
concerned
with
a
description
of
the
monster
with
whom
the
heroes
are
about
to
do
battle
khumbaba
whom
bel
had
appointed
to
guard
the
cedar
one
particular
cedar
which
appears
to
be
of
greater
height
and
sanctity
than
the
others
is
a
creature
of
most
terrifying
aspect
the
very
presence
of
whom
in
the
forest
makes
those
who
enter
it
grow
weak
and
impotent
as
the
heroes
draw
near
eabani
complains
that
his
hands
are
feeble
and
his
arms
without
strength
but
gilgamesh
speaks
words
of
encouragement
to
him
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
the
word
khumbaba
is
of
elamite
origin
a
fact
which
has
led
certain
authorities
to
identify
the
monster
with
an
elamite
dynasty
which
anciently
dominated
erech
and
which
came
to
grief
about
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
establish
the
connexion
between
the
mythical
encounter
and
a
definite
historical
event
but
it
may
at
least
be
presumed
that
the
bestowal
of
an
elamite
designation
on
the
monster
argues
a
certain
enmity
between
elam
and
babylon
the
next
fragments
bring
us
into
the
vth
tablet
the
heroes
having
reached
a
verdant
mountain
paused
to
survey
the
forest
of
cedars
when
they
entered
the
forest
the
death
of
khumbaba
was
foretold
to
one
or
other
or
both
of
them
in
a
dream
and
they
hastened
forward
to
the
combat
unfortunately
the
text
of
the
actual
encounter
has
not
been
preserved
but
we
learn
from
the
context
that
the
heroes
were
successful
in
slaying
khumbaba
ishtar
love
for
gilgamesh
in
the
vith
tablet
which
relates
the
story
of
ishtar
love
for
gilgamesh
and
the
slaying
of
the
sacred
bull
victory
again
waits
on
the
arms
of
the
heroes
but
here
nevertheless
we
have
the
key
to
the
misfortunes
which
later
befall
them
on
his
return
to
erech
after
the
destruction
of
khumbaba
gilgamesh
was
loudly
acclaimed
doffing
the
soiled
and
bloodstained
garments
he
had
worn
during
the
battle
he
robed
himself
as
befitted
a
monarch
and
a
conqueror
ishtar
beheld
the
king
in
his
regal
splendour
the
flowers
of
victory
still
fresh
on
his
brow
and
her
heart
went
out
to
him
in
love
in
moving
and
seductive
terms
she
besought
him
to
be
her
bridegroom
promising
that
if
he
would
enter
her
house
in
the
gloom
of
the
cedar
all
manner
of
good
gifts
should
be
his
his
flocks
and
herds
would
increase
his
horses
and
oxen
would
be
without
rival
the
river
euphrates
would
kiss
his
feet
and
kings
and
princes
would
bring
tribute
to
him
but
gilgamesh
knowing
something
of
the
past
history
of
this
capricious
goddess
rejected
her
advances
with
scorn
and
began
to
revile
her
he
taunted
her
too
with
her
treatment
of
former
lovers
of
tammuz
the
bridegroom
of
her
youth
to
whom
she
clung
weepingly
year
after
year
of
alalu
the
eagle
of
a
lion
perfect
in
might
and
a
horse
glorious
in
battle
of
the
shepherd
tabulu
and
of
isullanu
the
gardener
of
her
father
all
these
she
had
mocked
and
in
cruel
fashion
and
gilgamesh
perceived
that
like
treatment
would
be
meted
out
to
him
should
he
accept
the
proffered
love
of
the
goddess
the
deity
was
greatly
enraged
at
the
repulse
and
mounted
up
to
heaven
moreover
ishtar
went
before
anu
her
father
before
anu
she
went
and
she
said
my
father
gilgamesh
has
kept
watch
on
me
gilgamesh
has
counted
my
garlands
my
garlands
and
my
girdles
underlying
the
story
of
ishtar
love
for
gilgamesh
there
is
evidently
a
of
some
sort
perhaps
a
myth
gilgamesh
the
or
a
hero
who
has
taken
over
his
attributes
is
wooed
by
ishtar
the
goddess
of
fertility
the
great
who
presides
over
spring
vegetation
in
the
recital
of
her
former
we
find
mention
of
the
tammuz
myth
in
which
ishtar
slew
her
consort
tammuz
and
other
mythological
fragments
it
is
possible
also
that
there
is
an
astrological
significance
in
this
part
of
the
narrative
the
bull
of
anu
to
resume
the
tale
in
her
wrath
and
humiliation
ishtar
appealed
to
her
father
and
mother
anu
and
anatu
and
begged
the
former
to
create
a
mighty
bull
and
send
it
against
gilgamesh
anu
at
first
demurred
declaring
that
if
he
did
so
it
would
result
in
seven
years
sterility
on
the
earth
but
finally
he
consented
and
a
great
bull
alu
was
sent
to
do
battle
with
gilgamesh
the
portion
of
the
text
which
deals
with
the
combat
is
much
mutilated
but
it
appears
that
the
conflict
was
hot
and
sustained
the
celestial
animal
finally
succumbing
to
a
from
gilgamesh
ishtar
looks
on
in
impotent
anger
then
ishtar
went
up
on
to
the
wall
of
erech
she
mounted
to
the
top
and
she
uttered
a
curse
saying
be
gilgamesh
who
has
provoked
me
to
anger
and
has
slain
the
bull
from
heaven
then
eabani
incurs
the
anger
of
the
deity
when
eabani
heard
these
words
of
ishtar
he
tore
out
the
entrails
of
the
bull
and
he
cast
them
before
her
saying
for
thee
i
will
conquer
thee
and
i
will
do
to
thee
even
as
i
have
done
to
him
ishtar
was
beside
herself
with
rage
gilgamesh
and
his
companion
dedicated
the
great
horns
of
the
bull
to
the
and
having
washed
their
hands
in
the
river
euphrates
returned
once
more
to
erech
as
the
triumphal
procession
passed
through
the
city
the
people
came
out
of
their
houses
to
do
honour
to
the
heroes
the
remainder
of
the
tablet
is
concerned
with
a
great
banquet
given
by
gilgamesh
to
celebrate
his
victory
over
the
bull
alu
and
with
further
visions
of
eabani
the
viith
and
viiith
tablets
are
extremely
fragmentary
and
so
much
of
the
text
as
is
preserved
is
open
to
various
readings
it
is
possible
that
to
the
viith
tablet
belongs
a
description
of
the
underworld
given
to
eabani
in
a
dream
by
the
ukhut
whom
he
had
cursed
in
a
previous
tablet
and
who
had
since
died
the
description
answers
to
that
given
in
another
ancient
text
the
myth
of
ishtar
descent
into
hades
and
evidently
embodies
the
popular
belief
concerning
the
underworld
come
descend
with
me
to
the
house
of
darkness
the
abode
of
irkalla
to
the
house
whence
the
enterer
goes
not
forth
to
the
path
whose
way
has
no
return
to
the
house
whose
dwellers
are
deprived
of
light
where
dust
is
their
nourishment
and
earth
their
good
they
are
clothed
like
the
birds
in
a
garment
of
feathers
they
see
not
the
light
they
dwell
in
darkness
the
death
of
eabani
this
sinister
vision
appears
to
have
been
a
presage
of
eabani
death
shortly
afterwards
he
fell
ill
and
died
at
the
end
of
twelve
days
the
manner
of
his
death
is
uncertain
one
reading
of
the
mutilated
text
represents
eabani
as
being
wounded
perhaps
in
battle
and
succumbing
to
the
effects
of
the
wound
but
another
makes
him
say
to
his
friend
gilgamesh
i
have
been
cursed
my
friend
i
shall
not
die
as
one
who
has
been
slain
in
battle
the
breaks
in
the
text
are
responsible
for
the
divergence
the
latter
reading
is
probably
the
correct
one
eabani
has
grievously
offended
ishtar
the
and
the
curse
which
has
smitten
him
to
the
earth
is
probably
hers
in
modern
phraseology
he
died
of
the
death
of
the
hero
brings
the
viiith
tablet
to
a
close
in
the
ixth
tablet
we
find
gilgamesh
mourning
the
loss
of
his
friend
the
quest
of
gilgamesh
on
the
heart
of
gilgamesh
likewise
the
fear
of
death
had
taken
hold
and
he
determined
to
go
in
search
of
his
ancestor
who
might
be
able
to
show
him
a
way
of
escape
straightway
putting
his
determination
into
effect
gilgamesh
set
out
for
the
abode
of
on
the
way
he
had
to
pass
through
mountain
gorges
made
terrible
by
the
presence
of
wild
beasts
from
the
power
of
these
he
was
delivered
by
sin
the
who
enabled
him
to
traverse
the
mountain
passes
in
safety
at
length
he
came
to
a
mountain
higher
than
the
rest
the
entrance
to
which
was
guarded
by
this
was
mashu
the
mountain
of
the
sunset
which
lies
on
the
western
horizon
between
the
earth
and
the
underworld
then
he
came
to
the
mountain
of
mashu
the
portals
of
which
are
guarded
every
day
by
monsters
their
backs
mount
up
to
the
ramparts
of
heaven
and
their
foreparts
reach
down
beneath
aralu
guard
the
gate
of
mashu
they
strike
terror
into
men
and
it
is
death
to
behold
them
their
splendour
is
great
for
it
overwhelms
the
mountains
from
sunrise
to
sunset
they
guard
the
sun
gilgamesh
beheld
them
and
his
face
grew
dark
with
fear
and
terror
and
the
wildness
of
their
aspect
robbed
him
of
his
senses
on
approaching
the
entrance
to
the
mountain
gilgamesh
found
his
way
barred
by
these
who
perceiving
the
strain
of
divinity
in
him
did
not
blast
him
with
their
glance
but
questioned
him
regarding
his
purpose
in
drawing
near
the
mountain
of
mashu
when
gilgamesh
had
replied
to
their
queries
telling
them
how
he
wished
to
reach
the
abode
of
his
ancestor
and
there
learn
the
secret
of
perpetual
life
and
youthfulness
the
advised
him
to
turn
back
before
him
they
said
lay
the
region
of
thick
darkness
for
twelve
hours
he
would
have
to
journey
through
the
thick
darkness
ere
he
again
emerged
into
the
light
of
day
and
so
they
refused
to
let
him
pass
but
gilgamesh
implored
with
tears
says
the
narrative
and
at
length
the
monsters
consented
to
admit
him
having
passed
the
gate
of
the
mountain
of
the
sunset
by
virtue
of
his
character
as
a
solar
deity
gilgamesh
traversed
the
region
of
thick
darkness
during
the
space
of
twelve
toward
the
end
of
that
period
the
darkness
became
ever
less
pronounced
finally
it
was
broad
day
and
gilgamesh
found
himself
in
a
beautiful
garden
or
park
studded
with
trees
among
which
was
the
tree
of
the
gods
thus
charmingly
depicted
in
the
text
precious
stones
it
bore
as
fruit
branches
hung
from
it
which
were
beautiful
to
behold
the
top
of
the
tree
was
and
it
was
laden
with
fruit
which
dazzled
the
eye
of
him
that
beheld
having
paused
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
scene
gilgamesh
bent
his
steps
shoreward
the
xth
tablet
describes
the
hero
encounter
with
the
sabitu
who
on
the
approach
of
one
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
god
in
whose
body
was
grief
and
who
looked
as
though
he
had
made
a
long
journey
retired
into
her
palace
and
fastened
the
door
but
gilgamesh
knowing
that
her
help
was
necessary
to
bring
him
to
the
dwelling
of
told
her
of
his
quest
and
in
despair
threatened
to
break
down
the
door
unless
she
opened
to
him
at
last
sabitu
consented
to
listen
to
him
whilst
he
asked
the
way
to
like
the
the
perceived
that
gilgamesh
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
from
his
quest
so
at
last
she
bade
him
go
to
ferryman
without
whose
aid
she
said
it
would
be
futile
to
persist
further
in
his
mission
likewise
being
consulted
by
gilgamesh
advised
him
to
desist
but
the
hero
pursuing
his
plan
of
intimidation
began
to
smash
the
ferryman
boat
with
his
axe
whereupon
was
obliged
to
yield
he
sent
his
passenger
into
the
forest
for
a
new
rudder
and
after
that
the
two
sailed
away
gilgamesh
and
was
indeed
surprised
when
he
beheld
gilgamesh
approaching
the
strand
the
hero
had
meanwhile
contracted
a
grievous
illness
so
that
he
was
unable
to
leave
the
boat
but
he
addressed
his
queries
concerning
perpetual
life
to
the
deified
who
stood
on
the
shore
the
hero
of
the
flood
was
exceeding
sorrowful
and
explained
that
death
is
the
common
lot
of
mankind
nor
is
it
given
to
man
to
know
the
hour
when
the
hand
of
death
will
fall
upon
him
the
annunaki
the
great
gods
decree
fate
and
with
them
mammetum
the
maker
of
destiny
and
they
determine
death
and
life
but
the
days
of
death
are
not
known
the
narrative
is
continued
without
interruption
into
the
xith
tablet
gilgamesh
listened
with
pardonable
scepticism
to
the
platitudes
of
his
ancestor
behold
thee
thy
appearance
differs
not
from
mine
thou
art
like
unto
me
thou
art
not
otherwise
than
i
am
thou
art
like
unto
me
thy
heart
is
stout
for
the
battle
how
hast
thou
entered
the
assembly
of
the
gods
how
hast
thou
found
life
the
deluge
myth
in
reply
introduces
the
story
of
the
babylonian
deluge
which
told
as
it
is
without
interruption
forms
a
separate
and
complete
narrative
and
is
in
itself
a
myth
of
exceptional
interest
presumably
the
warning
of
the
deluge
came
to
in
a
vision
the
voice
of
the
god
said
man
of
shurippak
son
of
pull
down
thy
house
build
a
ship
forsake
thy
possessions
take
heed
for
thy
life
abandon
thy
goods
save
thy
life
and
bring
up
living
seed
of
every
kind
into
the
ship
the
ship
itself
was
to
be
carefully
planned
and
built
according
to
ea
instructions
when
the
god
had
spoken
promised
obedience
to
the
divine
command
but
he
was
still
perplexed
as
to
how
he
should
answer
the
people
when
they
asked
the
reason
for
his
preparations
ea
therefore
instructed
him
how
he
should
make
reply
hath
cast
me
forth
for
he
hateth
me
the
purpose
of
this
reply
seems
clear
though
the
remaining
few
lines
of
it
are
rather
broken
ea
intends
that
shall
disarm
the
suspicions
of
the
people
by
declaring
that
the
object
of
his
shipbuilding
and
his
subsequent
departure
is
to
escape
the
wrath
of
bel
which
he
is
to
depict
as
falling
on
him
alone
he
must
prophesy
the
coming
of
the
rain
but
must
represent
it
not
as
a
devastating
flood
but
rather
as
a
mark
of
the
prosperity
which
bel
will
grant
to
the
people
of
shurippak
perhaps
by
reason
of
his
departure
therefrom
the
babylonian
ark
employed
many
people
in
the
construction
of
the
ship
during
four
days
he
gathered
the
material
and
built
the
ship
on
the
fifth
he
laid
it
down
on
the
sixth
he
loaded
it
and
by
the
seventh
day
it
was
finished
on
a
hull
cubits
wide
was
constructed
a
great
cubits
high
divided
into
six
stories
each
of
which
was
divided
in
turn
into
nine
rooms
the
outside
of
the
ship
was
made
with
bitumen
and
the
inside
with
pitch
to
signalise
the
completion
of
his
vessel
gave
a
great
feast
like
that
which
was
wont
to
be
held
on
new
year
day
oxen
were
slaughtered
and
great
quantities
of
wine
and
oil
provided
according
to
the
command
of
ea
brought
into
the
ship
all
his
possessions
his
silver
and
his
gold
living
seed
of
every
kind
all
his
family
and
household
the
cattle
and
beasts
of
the
field
the
handicraftsmen
all
that
was
his
a
heavy
rain
at
eventide
was
the
sign
for
to
enter
the
ship
and
fasten
the
door
all
night
long
it
rained
and
with
the
early
dawn
there
came
up
from
the
horizon
a
black
cloud
ramman
in
the
midst
thereof
thundered
and
nabu
and
marduk
went
before
they
passed
like
messengers
over
mountain
and
plain
uragal
parted
the
there
went
ninib
and
he
made
the
storm
to
burst
the
annunaki
carried
flaming
torches
and
with
the
brightness
thereof
they
lit
up
the
earth
the
whirlwind
of
ramman
mounted
up
into
the
heavens
and
all
light
was
turned
into
darkness
during
a
whole
day
darkness
and
chaos
appear
to
have
reigned
on
the
earth
men
could
no
longer
behold
each
other
the
very
gods
in
heaven
were
afraid
and
crouched
like
hounds
weeping
and
lamenting
their
share
in
the
destruction
of
mankind
for
six
days
and
nights
the
tempest
raged
but
on
the
seventh
day
the
rain
ceased
and
the
floods
began
to
abate
then
says
i
looked
upon
the
sea
and
cried
aloud
for
all
mankind
was
turned
back
into
clay
in
place
of
the
fields
a
swamp
lay
before
me
i
opened
the
window
and
the
light
fell
upon
my
cheek
i
bowed
myself
down
i
sat
down
i
wept
over
my
cheek
flowed
my
tears
i
looked
upon
the
world
and
behold
all
was
sea
the
bird
messengers
at
length
the
ship
came
to
rest
on
the
summit
of
mount
nitsir
there
are
various
readings
of
this
portion
of
the
text
thus
after
twelve
days
the
land
appeared
or
at
the
distance
of
twelve
kasbu
the
land
appeared
or
twelve
cubits
above
the
water
the
land
appeared
however
this
may
be
the
ship
remained
for
six
days
on
the
mountain
and
on
the
seventh
sent
out
a
dove
but
the
dove
found
no
and
so
she
returned
then
he
sent
out
a
swallow
which
also
returned
having
found
no
spot
whereon
to
rest
finally
a
raven
was
sent
forth
and
as
by
this
time
the
waters
had
begun
to
abate
the
bird
drew
near
to
the
ship
wading
and
croaking
but
did
not
enter
the
vessel
then
brought
his
household
and
all
his
possessions
into
the
open
air
and
made
an
offering
to
the
gods
of
reed
and
and
incense
the
fragrant
odour
of
the
incense
came
up
to
the
gods
and
they
gathered
like
flies
says
the
narrative
around
the
sacrifice
among
the
company
was
ishtar
the
lady
of
the
gods
who
lifted
up
the
necklace
which
anu
had
given
her
saying
what
gods
these
are
by
the
jewels
of
which
are
upon
my
neck
i
will
not
forget
these
days
i
have
set
in
my
memory
never
will
i
forget
them
let
the
gods
come
to
the
offering
but
bel
shall
not
come
to
the
offering
since
he
refused
to
ask
counsel
and
sent
the
deluge
and
handed
over
my
people
unto
destruction
illustration
makes
offering
to
the
gods
alan
by
permission
of
hutchinson
and
the
god
bel
was
very
wroth
when
he
discovered
that
a
mortal
man
had
survived
the
deluge
and
vowed
that
should
perish
but
ea
defended
his
action
in
having
saved
his
favourite
from
destruction
pointing
out
that
bel
had
refused
to
take
counsel
when
he
planned
a
universal
disaster
and
advising
him
in
future
to
visit
the
sin
on
the
sinner
and
not
to
punish
the
entire
human
race
finally
bel
was
mollified
he
approached
the
ship
into
which
it
would
appear
that
the
remnants
of
the
human
race
had
retired
during
the
altercation
and
led
and
his
wife
into
the
open
where
he
bestowed
on
them
his
blessing
then
they
took
me
says
and
afar
off
at
the
mouth
of
the
rivers
they
made
me
to
dwell
such
is
the
story
of
the
deluge
which
told
to
gilgamesh
no
cause
is
assigned
for
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
other
than
the
enmity
which
seems
to
have
existed
between
man
and
the
gods
particularly
the
bel
but
it
appears
from
the
latter
part
of
the
narrative
that
in
the
assembly
of
the
gods
the
majority
contemplated
only
the
destruction
of
the
city
of
shurippak
and
not
that
of
the
entire
human
family
it
has
been
suggested
indeed
that
the
story
as
it
is
here
given
is
compounded
of
two
separate
myths
one
relating
to
a
universal
catastrophe
perhaps
a
mythological
type
of
a
periodic
inundation
and
the
other
dealing
with
a
local
disaster
such
as
might
have
been
occasioned
by
a
phenomenal
overflow
of
the
euphrates
the
antiquity
of
the
legend
and
its
original
character
are
clearly
shown
by
comparison
with
another
version
of
the
myth
inscribed
on
a
tablet
found
at
the
ancient
site
of
sippar
and
dated
in
the
century
before
our
era
notwithstanding
the
imperfect
preservation
of
this
text
it
is
possible
to
perceive
in
it
many
points
of
resemblance
to
the
gilgamesh
variant
berossus
also
quotes
a
version
of
the
deluge
myth
in
his
history
substituting
chronos
for
ea
king
xisuthros
for
and
the
city
of
sippar
for
that
of
shurippak
in
this
version
immortality
is
bestowed
not
only
on
the
hero
and
his
wife
but
also
on
his
daughter
and
his
pilot
one
writer
ingeniously
identifies
these
latter
with
sabitu
and
respectively
to
return
to
the
epic
the
recital
of
served
its
primary
purpose
in
the
narrative
by
proving
to
gilgamesh
that
his
case
was
not
that
of
his
deified
ancestor
meanwhile
the
hero
had
remained
in
the
boat
too
ill
to
come
ashore
now
took
pity
on
him
and
promised
to
restore
him
to
health
first
of
all
bidding
him
sleep
during
six
days
and
seven
nights
gilgamesh
listened
to
his
advice
and
by
and
by
sleep
like
a
tempest
breathed
upon
him
wife
beholding
the
sleeping
hero
was
likewise
moved
with
compassion
and
asked
her
husband
to
send
the
traveller
safely
home
he
in
turn
bade
his
wife
compound
a
magic
preparation
containing
seven
ingredients
and
administer
it
to
gilgamesh
while
he
slept
this
was
done
and
an
enchantment
thus
put
upon
the
hero
when
he
awoke
on
the
seventh
day
he
renewed
his
importunate
request
for
the
secret
of
perpetual
life
his
host
sent
him
to
a
spring
of
water
where
he
might
bathe
his
sores
and
be
healed
and
having
tested
the
efficacy
of
the
magic
waters
gilgamesh
returned
once
more
to
his
dwelling
doubtless
to
persist
in
his
quest
for
life
notwithstanding
that
had
already
declared
it
impossible
for
gilgamesh
to
attain
immortality
he
now
directed
him
apparently
at
the
instance
of
his
wife
to
the
place
where
he
would
find
the
plant
of
life
and
instructed
to
conduct
him
thither
the
magic
plant
which
bestowed
immortality
and
eternal
youth
on
him
who
ate
of
it
appears
to
have
been
a
weed
a
creeping
plant
with
thorns
which
pricked
the
hands
of
the
gatherer
and
curiously
enough
gilgamesh
seems
to
have
sought
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
at
length
the
plant
was
found
and
the
hero
declared
his
intention
of
carrying
it
with
him
to
erech
and
so
he
set
out
on
the
return
journey
accompanied
by
the
faithful
ferryman
not
only
on
the
first
and
watery
stage
of
his
travels
but
also
overland
to
the
city
of
erech
itself
when
they
had
journeyed
twenty
they
left
an
offering
presumably
for
the
dead
and
when
they
had
journeyed
thirty
they
repeated
a
funeral
chant
the
narrative
goes
on
gilgamesh
saw
a
well
of
fresh
water
he
went
down
to
it
and
offered
a
libation
a
serpent
smelled
the
odour
of
the
plant
advanced
and
carried
off
the
plant
gilgamesh
sat
down
and
wept
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
he
lamented
bitterly
the
loss
of
the
precious
plant
seemingly
predicted
to
him
when
he
made
his
offering
at
the
end
of
twenty
at
length
they
reached
erech
when
gilgamesh
sent
to
enquire
concerning
the
building
of
the
city
walls
a
proceeding
which
has
possibly
some
mythological
significance
the
xiith
tablet
opens
with
the
lament
of
gilgamesh
for
his
friend
eabani
whose
loss
he
has
not
ceased
to
deplore
thou
canst
no
longer
stretch
thy
bow
upon
the
earth
and
those
who
were
slain
with
the
bow
are
round
about
thee
thou
canst
no
longer
bear
a
sceptre
in
thy
hand
and
the
spirits
of
the
dead
have
taken
thee
captive
thou
canst
no
longer
wear
shoes
upon
thy
feet
thou
canst
no
longer
raise
thy
on
the
earth
no
more
dost
thou
kiss
thy
wife
whom
thou
didst
love
no
more
dost
thou
smite
thy
wife
whom
thou
didst
hate
no
more
dost
thou
kiss
thy
daughter
whom
thou
didst
love
no
more
dost
thou
smite
thy
daughter
whom
thou
didst
hate
the
sorrow
of
the
underworld
hath
taken
hold
upon
thee
gilgamesh
went
from
temple
to
temple
making
offerings
and
desiring
the
gods
to
restore
eabani
to
him
to
ninsum
he
went
to
bel
and
to
sin
the
but
they
heeded
him
not
at
length
he
cried
to
ea
who
took
compassion
on
him
and
persuaded
nergal
to
bring
the
shade
of
eabani
from
the
underworld
a
hole
was
opened
in
the
earth
and
the
spirit
of
the
dead
man
issued
therefrom
like
a
breath
of
wind
gilgamesh
addressed
eabani
thus
tell
me
my
friend
tell
me
my
friend
the
law
of
the
earth
which
thou
hast
seen
tell
me
eabani
answered
him
i
can
not
tell
thee
my
friend
i
can
not
tell
thee
but
afterwards
having
bidden
gilgamesh
sit
down
and
weep
he
proceeded
to
tell
him
of
the
conditions
which
prevailed
in
the
underworld
contrasting
the
lot
of
the
warrior
duly
buried
with
that
of
a
person
whose
corpse
is
cast
uncared
for
into
the
fields
on
a
couch
he
lieth
and
drinketh
pure
water
the
man
who
was
slain
in
battle
thou
and
i
have
oft
seen
such
an
one
his
father
and
his
mother
support
his
head
and
his
wife
kneeleth
at
his
side
but
the
man
whose
corpse
is
cast
upon
the
field
thou
and
i
have
oft
seen
such
an
one
his
spirit
resteth
not
in
the
earth
the
man
whose
spirit
has
none
to
care
for
it
thou
and
i
have
oft
seen
such
an
one
the
dregs
of
the
vessel
the
leavings
of
the
feast
and
that
which
is
cast
out
upon
the
streets
are
his
food
upon
this
solemn
note
the
epic
closes
the
doctrine
of
the
necessity
for
ministering
to
the
dead
is
here
enunciated
in
no
uncertain
fashion
unless
their
bodies
are
decently
buried
and
offerings
of
food
and
drink
made
at
their
graves
their
lives
in
the
otherworld
must
be
abjectly
miserable
the
manner
in
which
they
meet
their
end
is
likewise
taken
into
account
and
warriors
who
have
fallen
on
the
field
of
battle
are
fortunate
eabani
is
evidently
one
of
the
spirits
his
ghost
is
designated
a
name
applied
not
only
to
the
fortunate
dead
but
likewise
to
a
class
of
beneficent
supernatural
beings
the
term
on
the
other
hand
designates
a
species
of
malevolent
being
as
well
as
the
errant
and
even
vampirish
spirits
of
the
unhappy
dead
the
due
observance
of
funeral
and
commemorative
rites
is
thus
a
matter
which
touches
the
interests
not
only
of
the
deceased
but
also
of
his
relatives
and
friends
we
have
seen
from
the
foregoing
that
the
epic
of
gilgamesh
is
partly
historical
partly
mythological
around
the
figure
of
a
great
national
hero
myths
have
grown
and
twined
with
the
passing
of
the
generations
and
these
have
in
time
become
woven
into
a
connected
narrative
setting
forth
a
myth
which
corresponds
to
the
daily
or
annual
course
of
the
sun
within
this
may
be
discerned
other
myths
and
fragments
of
myths
solar
seasonal
and
diluvian
but
there
is
in
the
epic
another
important
element
which
has
already
been
referred
to
the
the
zodiacal
significance
of
the
division
of
the
epic
into
twelve
tablets
may
be
set
aside
since
as
has
been
indicated
the
significance
is
in
all
probability
a
superficial
one
merely
added
to
the
poem
by
the
scribes
of
and
not
forming
an
integral
part
of
it
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
hard
to
divide
the
epic
naturally
into
twelve
episodes
thus
gilgamesh
oppression
of
erech
the
seduction
of
eabani
the
slaying
of
the
monster
khumbaba
the
wooing
of
ishtar
the
fight
with
the
sacred
bull
eabani
death
gilgamesh
journey
to
the
mountain
of
the
sunset
his
wanderings
in
the
region
of
thick
darkness
the
crossing
of
the
waters
of
death
the
the
plant
of
life
the
return
of
eabani
spirit
throughout
the
epic
there
are
indications
of
a
correspondence
between
the
exploits
of
the
hero
and
the
movements
of
heavenly
bodies
it
is
possible
for
instance
that
gilgamesh
and
his
friend
eabani
had
some
relation
to
the
sign
gemini
also
associated
in
ancient
chaldean
mythology
with
two
forms
of
the
solar
deity
even
as
were
the
hero
and
his
friend
the
sign
leo
recalls
the
slaying
of
khumbaba
the
allegorical
victory
of
light
over
darkness
represented
on
monuments
by
the
figure
of
a
lion
symbol
of
fire
fighting
with
a
bull
following
the
sign
of
leo
the
wooing
of
the
hero
by
the
goddess
ishtar
falls
naturally
into
the
sign
of
virgo
the
virgin
the
sign
of
taurus
is
represented
by
the
slaying
of
the
celestial
bull
alu
by
gilgamesh
the
journey
of
the
hero
to
mashu
and
his
encounter
with
the
at
the
gate
of
the
sunset
are
of
course
mythological
representations
of
the
sign
of
scorpio
as
are
also
his
wanderings
in
the
region
of
thick
darkness
it
is
noticeable
in
this
respect
that
babylonian
astrology
often
doubled
the
eighth
sign
scorpio
to
provide
a
seventh
it
is
therefore
not
unlikely
that
this
sign
should
correspond
with
two
distinct
episodes
in
the
poem
the
first
of
these
episodes

the

of

perhaps
the

is
the
conventional

evidently
in
keeping

the
astrological
aspect
of
the
epic
chaldean
mythology
connected
the
rainy
eleventh

with
the
deluge
just
as
the
first
month

possibly
symbolise

perhaps
also
to
the
restoration
of
gilgamesh
to
erech
is
emblematic
of
life
after
death
and
of
the
resumption
of
ordinary
conditions
after
the
deluge
it
has
been
suggested
though
without
any
very
definite
basis
that
the
epic
was
first
put
together
before
the
zodiac
was
divided
into
twelve
that
is
more
than
two
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
its
antiquity
however
rests
on
other
grounds
than
these
in
later
times
the
babylonian
astrological
system
became
very
complicated
and
important
and
so
lent
its
colour
to
the
epic
that
whatever
the
original
plan
of
that
work
may
have
been
its
astral
significance
became
at
length
its
most
popular
aspect
that
is
we
have
no
definite
historical
notices
concerning
him
but
we
may
infer
from
internal
evidence
in
his
saga
that
he
possesses
a
certain
amount
of
historicity
by
the
discovery
by
mr
pinches
in
a
lexicographical
tablet
that
the
inconsistency
in
details
is
caused
by
the
composite
nature
of
the
tale
which
is
drawn
from
two
different
tablets
these
remarks
are
perhaps
not
to
be
taken
literally
of
eabani
they
represent
the
entirely
formal
manner
in
which
any
deceased
babylonian
was
addressed

the
later
pantheon
of
babylonia
the
reign
of
khammurabi
is
a
convenient
point
at
which
to
observe
general
changes
in
and
later
introductions
to
the
pantheon
of
the
babylonian
gods
the
political
alterations
in
the
kingdom
were
reflected
in
the
divine
circle
certain
gods
were
relegated
to
the
cold
shades
of
obscurity
whilst
new
deities
were
adopted
and
others
hitherto
regarded
as
negligible
quantities
were
exalted
to
the
heights
of
heavenly
omnipotence
the
worship
of
merodach
first
came
into
prominence
in
the
days
of
khammurabi
but
his
cult
is
so
outstanding
and
important
that
it
has
been
deemed
better
to
deal
with
it
in
a
separate
and
later
chapter

we
shall
examine
the
nature
of
some
of

nebo
son
of
merodach
god
of
wisdom
and
the
inventor
of
photo
mansell
and
nebo
the
popularity
of
nebo
was
brought
about
through
his
association
with
merodach
his
chief
seat
of
worship
was
at
borsippa
opposite
to
babylon
and
when
the
latter
city
became
the
seat
of
the
imperial
power
the
proximity
of
borsippa
greatly
assisted
the
cult
of
nebo
so
close
did
the
association
between
the
deities
of
the
two
cities
become
that
at
length
nebo
was
regarded
as
the
son
of
merodach
a
relationship
that
often
implies
that
the
descendant
of
the
elder
god
is
a
serious
rival
or
that
his
cult
is
nearly
allied
to
the
elder
worship
nebo
had
acquired
something
of
a
reputation
as
a
god
of
wisdom
and
probably
this
it
was
which
permitted
him
to
stand
separately
from
merodach
without
becoming
absorbed
in
the
cult
of
the
great
deity
of
babylon
he
was
credited
like
ea
with
the
invention
of
writing
the
province
of
all
gods
and
he
presided
over
that
department
of
knowledge
which
interpreted
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
the
priests
of
nebo
were
famous
as
astrologers
and
with
the
bookish
king
nebo
and
his
consort
tashmit
were
especial
favourites
as
the
patrons
of
writing
by
the
time
that
the
worship
of
merodach
had
become
recognised
at
babylon
the
cult
of
nebo
at
borsippa
was
so
securely
rooted
that
even
the
proximity
of
the
greatest
god
in
the
land
failed
to
shake
it
even
after
the
persian
conquest
the
at
borsippa
continued
to
flourish
but
although
nebo
thus
many
of
the
greater
gods
it
is
now
almost
impossible
to
trace
his
original
significance
as
a
deity
whether
solar
or
aqueous
in
his
nature
and
the
latter
appears
more
likely
he
was
during
the
period
of
merodach
ascendancy
regarded
as
scribe
of
the
gods
much
as
thoth
was
the
amanuensis
of
the
egyptian
otherworld
that
is
to
say
he
wrote
at
the
dictation
of
the
higher
deities
when
the
gods
were
assembled
in
the
chamber
of
fates
in
merodach
temple
at
babylon
he
chronicled
their
speeches
and
deliberations
and
put
them
on
record
indeed
he
himself
had
a
shrine
in
this
temple
of
or
lofty
house
which
was
known
as
or
firm
house
once
during
the
new
year
festival
nebo
was
carried
from
borsippa
to
babylon
to
his
father
temple
and
in
compliment
was
escorted
by
merodach
part
of
the
way
back
to
his
own
shrine
in
the
lesser
city
it
is
strange
to
see
how
closely
the
cults
of
the
two
gods
were
interwoven
the
kings
of
babylonia
constantly
invoke
them
together
their
names
and
those
of
their
temples
are
found
in
close
proximity
at
every
turn
and
the
symbols
of
the
bow
and
the
stylus
or
pen
respectively
typical
of
the
father
and
the
son
are
usually
discovered
in
one
and
the
same
inscription
even
dragon
the
symbol
of
his
victory
over
the
dark
forces
of
chaos
is
assigned
to
nebo
nebo
as
but
nebo
seems
to
have
had
also
an
agricultural
side
to
his
character
in
many
texts
he
is
praised
as
the
god
who
opens
up
the
subterranean
sources
in
order
to
irrigate
the
fields
and
the
withdrawal
of
his
favour
is
followed
by
famine
and
distress
this
seems
to
favour
the
idea
of
his
watery
nature
his
name
proclaimer
does
not
assist
us
much
in
fixing
his
mythological
significance
unless
it
was
assigned
to
him

the
of

it
is
believed
that
khammurabi
unsuccessful
in
suppressing
the
cult
of
nebo
succeeded
with
that
of
his
spouse
she
seems
to
have
been
the
same
as
a
goddess
ealur
who
became
amalgamated
with
zarpanitum
the
wife
of
merodach

mean
according
to
some
hearer
and
to
others
a
and
in
view
of
the
character
of
her
wise
husband
was
perhaps
one
of
the
original
designations
of
merodach
himself
tashmit
had
therefore
but
little
individuality
none
the
less
she
possessed
considerable
popularity
on
a
dating
somewhere
between
there
are
outlined
two
figures
male
and
female
supposed
to
represent
nebo
and
tashmit
the
former
has
a
mouth
and
the
latter
ears
of
extraordinary
size
both
are
holding
wild
animals
by
the
horns
and
the
representation
is
thought
to
be
typical
of
the
strength
or
power
of
speech
and
silence
shamash
and
khammurabi
we
find
that
khammurabi
was
very
devoted
to
shamash
the
early
type
of
his
improvements
and
restorations
at
sippar
and
larsa
were
extensive
the
later
babylonian
monarchs
followed
his
example
and
one
of
them
even
placed
shamash
before
merodach
in
the
pantheon
the
early
connexion
between
merodach
and
shamash
had
probably
much
to
do
with
the
great
popularity
of
the
latter
that
this
was
the
case
so
far
at
least
as
khammurabi
was
concerned
is
obvious
from
certain
of
his
inscriptions
in
which
he
alludes
in
the
same
sentence
to
merodach
and
shamash
and
to
their
close
relationship
khammurabi
appears
also
to
have
been
greatly
attached
to
the
cult
of
a
goddess
innana
or
ninni
or
lady
who
was
evidently
the
consort
of
some
male
deity
he
improved
her
temple
at
hallabi
and
speaks
of
her
as
placing
the
reins
of
power
in
his
hands
there
was
another
goddess
of
the
same
name
at
lagash
whom
gudea
worshipped
as
of
the
world
but
she
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
same
as
the
innana
of
hallabi
near
sippar
as
she
was
a
goddess
of
fertility
and
generation
of
the
goddess
type
and
there
do
not
appear
to
be
any
grounds
for
the
assertion
that
the
goddess
of
hallabi
can
be
equated
with
her
hadad
ramman
or
rimmon
identified
with

a
deity
of
later
type
and
introduction
indeed
ramman
may
be
merely
a
variant
or
subsidiary
name
meaning
as
it
does
thunderer
quite
a
common
title
for
several
types
of
deities
the
worship
of
hadad
was
widespread
in
syria
and
palestine
and
he
was
a
god
of
storms
or
rains
whose
symbol
was
the
thunderbolt
or
the
lightning
which
he
holds
in
his
grasp
like
a
fiery
sword
but
he
bears
solar
emblems
upon
his
apparel
and
seems
to
wear
a
solar
crown
he
does
not
however
appear
to
have
had
any
centre
of
worship
in
babylonia
and
was
probably
a
god
of
the
amorites
and
becoming
popular
with
the
babylonians
was
later
admitted
into
their
pantheon
at
asshur
in
assyria
he
was
worshipped
along
with
anu
with
whom
he
had
a
temple
in
common
this
building
which
was
excavated
in
contains
two
shrines
having
but
the
one
entrance
and
the
date
of
its
foundation
is
referred
so
far
back
as
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
partnership
of
hadad
with
anu
was
a
late
one
perhaps
it
was
on
assyrian
and
not
babylonian
soil
that
hadad
first
entered
from
the
alien
world
illustration
in
text
hadad
or
rimmon
from
belief
and
practices
in
babylonia
and
by
jastrow
sons
in
many
of
his
characteristics
hadad
closely
resembled
like
him
he
was
designated
great
mountain
and
seems
to
have
been
conceived
of
as
almost
a
counterpart
of
the
older
god
it
is
peculiar
that
while
in
assyria
and
babylonia
hadad
has
many
of
the
characteristics
of
a
in
his
old
home
in
syria
he
possessed
those
of
a
who
dwelt
among
the
mountains
of
northern
palestine
and
syria
and
spoke
in
thunder
and
wielded
the
lightning
but
even
in
assyria
the
stormy
characteristics
of
hadad
are
not
altogether
obscured
hadad
cult
in
babylonia
is
probably
not
much
older
than
the
days
of
khammurabi
in
whose
time
the
first
inscriptional
mention
of
him
is
made
his
worship
obtained
a
stronger
hold
in
the
times
of
the
kassite
dynasty
for
we
find
many
of
its
monarchs
incorporating
his
name
with
their
own
and
altogether
affording
him

prominent
place

confounded

in

article
i
have
alluded

my
conviction

the
names

pointed
to
a
worship
of
the
under
the
title
of
beloved
one
in
southern
canaan
as
well
as
in
ph
oe
nicia
i
had
little
idea
at
the
time
how
soon
my
belief
would
be
verified
within
the
last
year
the
squeeze
of
the
moabite
stone
now
in
the
louvre
has
been
subjected
to
a
thorough
examination
by
the
german
professors
socin
and
smend
with
the
result
of
correcting
some
of
the
received
readings
and
of
filling
up
some
of
the
lacunæ
one
of
the
most
important
discoveries
that
have
been
thus
made
is
that
the
israelites
of
the
northern
kingdom
worshipped
a
dodo
or
dod
by
the
side
of
yahveh
or
rather
that
they
adored
the
supreme
god
under
the
name
of
dodo
as
well
as
under
that
of
yahveh
mesha
the
moabite
king
in
describing
the
victories
which
his
god
chemosh
had
enabled
him
to
gain
over
his
israelitish
foes
tells
us
that
he
had
carried
away
from
atarath
or
altar
of
dodo
and
dragged
it
before
chemosh
and
from
nebo
or
altars
of
yahveh
which
he
likewise
before
chemosh
here
the
or
of
dodo
is
placed
in
parallelism
with
the
of
yahveh
and
it
is
quite
clear
therefore
that
dodo
like
yahveh
was
a
name
under
which
the
deity
was
worshipped
by
the
people
of
the
land
i
have
suggested
that
dod
or
dodo
was
an
old
title
of
the
supreme
god
in
the
jebusite
jerusalem
and
that
hence
isaiah
v
when
describing
jerusalem
as
the
tower
of
the
vineyard
the
lord
had
planted
in
israel
calls
him
beloved
we
can
easily
understand
how
a
name
of
the
kind
with
such
a
signification
should
have
been
transferred
by
popular
affection
from
the
deity
to
the
king
of
whom
it
is
said
that
israel
and
judah
loved
him
i
sam
xviii
ea
in

times
ea
developed
with
the
centuries
and
about
the
epoch
of
khammurabi
appears
to
have
achieved
a
high
standard
of
godhead
probably
because
of
the
very
considerable
amount
of
theological
moulding
which
he
had
received
in
the
later
babylonian
period
we
find
him
described
as
the
protagonist
of
mankind
the
father
of
merodach
and
along
with
anu
and
bel
a
member
of
a
great
triad
the
priests
of
babylon
were
the
sole
mythographers
of
these
days
this
is
in
sharp
contradistinction
to
the
mythographers
of
greece
who
were
nearly
always
philosophers
and
never
priests
but
they
were
mythographers
in
a
secondary
sense
only
for
they
merely
rearranged
or
otherwise
altered
already
existing
tales
relating
to
the
gods
usually
with
a
view
to
the
exaltation
of
a
certain
deity
or
to
enable
his
story
to
fit
in
with
those
of
other
gods
it
is
only
after
a
religion
or
mythological
system
has
enjoyed
a
vogue
more
or
less
extended
that
the
relationship
of
the
gods
towards
one
another
becomes
fixed
the
appointment
of
merodach
to
the
supreme
position
in
the
babylonian
pantheon
naturally
necessitated
a
rearrangement
so
far
as
the
relationship
of
the
other
deities
to
him
was
concerned
this
meant
a
of
myth
and
tradition
generally
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
consistency
the
men
fitted
to
accomplish
such
a
task
were
to
hand
for
the
age
of
khammurabi
was
fertile
in
writers
scholastic
and
legal
who
would
be
well
equipped
to
carry
out
a
change
of
the
description
indicated
ea
had
not
in
the
past
enjoyed
any
very
exalted
sphere
but
as
the
chief
god
of
the
important
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
persian
gulf
the
most
ancient
home
of
babylonian
culture
ea
would
probably
have
exercised
a
great
influence
upon
the
antiquarian
and
historic
sense
of
a
man
like
khammurabi
as
the
god
of
wisdom
he
would
strongly
appeal
to
a
monarch
whose
whole
career
was
marked
by
a
love
of
justice
and
by
sagacity
and
insight
from
a
local
god
of
eridu
ea
became
a
universal
deity
of
wisdom
and
beneficence
the
strong
shield
of
man
and
his
benefactor
by
the
gifts
of
harvest
and
water
civilized
and
softer
emotions
must
have
begun
to
cluster
around
the
cult
of
this
kindly
god
who
when
the
angered
deities
resolved
to
destroy
mankind
interceded
for
poor
humanity
and
succeeded
in
preserving
it
from
the
divine
wrath
as
a
god
of
medicine
too
ea
is
humane
and
protective
in
character
and
all
the
arts
fall
under
his
patronage
he
is
the
of
babylon
he
might
not
transcend
merodach
so
he
became
his
father
thus
did
pagan
theology
succeed
in
merging
the
cults
of
deities
which
might
otherwise
have
been
serious
rivals
and
mutually
destructive
zu
zu
was
a
symbolized
in
the
form
of
a
bird
he
may
typify
the
advancing
which
would
have
seemed
to
those
of
old
as
if
hovering
like
a
great
bird
above
the
land
which
it
was
about
to
strike
the
indians
possess
such
a
mythological
conception
in
the
and
it
is
probable
that
the
great
bird
called
roc
so
well
known
to
readers
of
the
was
a
similar
monster
perhaps
the
descendant
of
the
we
remember
how
this
enormous
creature
descended
upon
the
ship
in
which
sindbad
sailed
and
carried
him
off
certain
it
is
that
we
can
trace
the
roc
or
rukh
to
the
persian
simurgh
which
is
again
referable
to
a
more
ancient
persian
form
the
amru
or
sinamru
the
bird
of
immortality
and
we
may
feel
sure
that
what
is
found
in
ancient
persian
lore
has
some
foundation
in
babylonian
belief
the
was
evidently
under
the
control
of
the
sun
and
his
attempt
to
break
away
from
the
solar
authority
is
related
in
the
following
legend
the
legend
of
zu
it
is
told
of
the
god
zu
that
on
one
occasion
ambition
awaking
in
his
breast
caused
him
to
cast
envious
eyes
on
the
power
and
sovereignty
of
bel
so
that
he
determined
to
purloin
the
tablets
of
destiny
which
were
the
tangible
symbols
of
bel
greatness
at
this
time
it
may
be
recalled
the
tablets
of
destiny
had
already
an
interesting
history
behind
them
we
are
told
in
the
creation
legend
how
apsu
the
primeval
and
tiawath
chaos
the
first
parents
of
the
gods
afterward
conceived
a
hatred
for
their
offspring
and
how
tiawath
with
her
of
snakes
and
vipers
dragons
and
and
raging
hounds
made
war
on
the
hosts
of
heaven
her
son
kingu
she
made
captain
of
her
hideous
army
to
march
before
the
forces
to
lead
the
host
to
give
the
to
advance
to
the
attack
to
direct
the
battle
to
control
the
fight
to
him
she
gave
the
tablets
of
destiny
laying
them
on
his
breast
with
the
words
thy
command
shall
not
be
without
avail
and
the
word
of
thy
mouth
shall
be
established
through
his
possession
of
the
divine
tablets
kingu
received
the
power
of
anu
and
was
able
to
decree
the
fate
of
the
gods
after
several
deities
had
refused
the
honour
of
becoming
champion
of
heaven
merodach
was
chosen
he
succeeded
at
length
in
slaying
tiawath
and
destroying
her
evil
host
and
having
vanquished
kingu
her
captain
he
took
from
him
the
tablets
of
destiny
which
he
sealed
and
laid
on
his
own
breast
it
was
this
merodach
or
marduk
who
afterward
became
identified
with
bel
now
zu
in
his
greed
for
power
and
dominion
was
eager
to
obtain
the
potent
symbols
he
beheld
the
honour
and
majesty
of
bel
and
from
contemplation
of
these
he
turned
to
look
upon
the
tablets
of
destiny
saying
within
himself
lo
i
will
possess
the
tablets
of
the
gods
and
all
things
shall
be
subject
unto
me
the
spirits
of
heaven
shall
bow
before
me
the
oracles
of
the
gods
shall
be
in
my
hands
i
shall
wear
the
crown
symbol
of
sovereignty
and
the
robe
symbol
of
godhead
and
then
shall
i
rule
over
all
the
hosts
of
heaven
thus
inflamed
he
sought
the
entrance
to
bel
hall
where
he
awaited
the
dawn
of
day
the
text
goes
on
now
when
bel
was
pouring
out
the
clear
water
the
light
of
day
and
his
diadem
was
taken
off
and
lay
upon
the
throne
zu
seized
the
tablets
of
destiny
he
took
bel
dominion
the
power
of
giving
commands
then
zu
fled
away
and
hid
himself
in
his
mountain
bel
was
greatly
enraged
at
the
theft
and
all
the
gods
with
him
anu
lord
of
heaven
summoned
about
him
his
divine
sons
and
asked
for
a
champion
to
recover
the
tablets
but
though
the
god
ramman
was
chosen
and
after
him
several
other
deities
they
all
refused
to
advance
against
zu
the
end
of
the
legend
is
unfortunately
missing
but
from
a
passage
in
another
tale
the
legend
of
etana
we
gather
that
it
was
the
shamash
who
eventually
stormed
the
of
zu
and
with
his
net
succeeded
in
capturing
the
presumptuous
deity
this
legend
is
of
the
prometheus
type
but
whereas
prometheus
once
a
steals
fire
from
heaven
for
the
behoof
of
mankind
zu
steals
the
tablets
of
destiny
for
his
own
these
must
of
course
be
regained
if
the
sovereignty
of
heaven
is
duly
to
continue
and
to
make
the
tale
circumstantial
the
is
provided
with
a
fowler
net
with
which
to
capture
the
recalcitrant
jastrow
believes
the
myth
to
have
been
manufactured
for
the
purpose
of
showing
how
the
tablets
of
power
were
originally
lost
by
the
older
bel
and
gained
by
merodach
but
he
has
discounted
the
reference
in
the
etana
legend
relating
to
their
recovery
bel
we
find
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
later
babylonian
religion
as
to
whether
the
name
is
intended
to
designate
the
old
god
of
that
name
or
is
merely
a
title
for
merodach
khammurabi
certainly
uses
the
name
occasionally
when
speaking
of
merodach
but
at
other
times
he
quite
as
surely
employs
it
for
the
older
divinity
as
for
example
when
he
couples
the
name
with
anu
one
of
the
kassite
kings
too
speaks
of
bel
the
lord
of
lands
meaning
the
old
bel
to
whom
they
often
gave
preference
over
merodach
they
also
preferred
the
old
city
of
nippur
and
its
temple
to
babylon
and
perhaps
made
an
attempt
at
one
time
to
make
nippur
the
capital
of
their
empire
illustration
hall
in
assyrian
palace
restored
from
a

by
sir
henry
layard
some
authorities
appear
to
think
it
strange
that
bel
should
have
existed
at
all
as
a
deity
after
the
elevation
of
merodach
to
the
highest
rank
in
the
pantheon
it
was
his
association
with
anu
and
ea
as
one
of
a
triad
presiding
over
the
heavens
the
earth
and
the
deep
which
kept
him
in
power
moreover
the
very
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
such
a
triad
proves
that
he
was
regarded
as
theologically
essential
to
the
of
the
babylonian
religion
as
a
whole
the
manufacture
or
slow
evolution
of
a
trinity
of
this
description
is
by
no
means
brought
about
through
popular
processes
it
is
indeed
the
work
of
a
school
of
a
college
of
priests
strangely
enough
khammurabi
seems
to
have
associated
anu
and
bel
together
but
to
have
entirely
omitted
ea
from
their
companionship
and
it
has
been
thought
that
the
conception
of
a
trinity
was
subsequent
to
his
epoch
the
god
of
earth
and
the
god
of
heaven
typify
respectively
that
which
is
above
and
that
which
is
below
and
are
reminiscent
of
the
and
of
many
primitive
mythologies
and
there
is
much
to
say
for
the
theory
that
ea
god
of
the
deep
although
he
had
existed
long
prior
to
any
such
grouping
was
a
later
inclusion
the
triad
of
earth
air
and
sea
the
habit
of
invoking
the
great
triad
became
almost
a
commonplace
in
later
babylonia
they
nearly
always
take
precedence
in
religious
inscriptions
and
we
even
find
some
monarchs
stating
that
they
hold
their
regal
authority
by
favour
of
the
trinity
whenever
a
powerful
curse
has
to
be
launched
one
may
be
certain
that
the
names
of
the
gods
of
the
elements
will
figure
in
it
dawkina
dawkina
was
the
consort
of
ea
and
was
occasionally
invoked
along
with
him
she
was
a
goddess
of
some
antiquity
and
strangely
enough
for
the
mate
of
a
she
appears
to
have
originally
been
connected
in
some
manner
with
the
earth
therefore
she
was
an
elemental
deity
in
later
times
her
attributes
appear
to
have
been
inherited
by
ishtar
according
to
some
authorities
bel
was
the
son
of
ea
and
dawkina
bel
in
this
case
meaning
merodach
we
find
her
name
frequently
alluded
to
in
the
magical
texts
but
her
cult
does
not
seem
to
have
been
very
widespread
anu
we
have
already
alluded
to
anu
position
in
the
triad
with
ea
and
bel
in
later
babylonian
times
when
he
stands
alone
we
find
him
taking
a
more
human
guise
than
as
the
mere
elemental
god
of
earlier
days
he
is
frequently
mentioned
in
the
texts
apart
from
ea
and
bel
and
is
occasionally
alluded
to
along
with
ramman
the
god
of
thunder
and
storms
who
of
course
would
naturally
stand
in
close
relationship
with
the
sky
we
also
find
him
connected
with
dagan
of
biblical
celebrity
but
in
this
case
dagan
appears
to
be
the
equivalent
of
bel
there
is
also
a
host
of
lesser
deities
the
majority
of
whom
are
no
more
than
mere
names
they
do
not
seem
to
have
achieved
much
popularity
or
if
they
did
it
was
an
evanescent
one
the
names
of
some
are
indeed
only
mentioned
once
or
twice
and
so
little
is
known
concerning
them
as
almost
to
leave
us
entirely
in
the
dark
regarding
their
natures
or
characteristics
pp
ff
chapter
vi
the
great
god
merodach
and
his
cult
the
entire
religious
system
of
babylonia
is
overshadowed
by
merodach
its
great
patron
deity
we
remember
how
he
usurped
the
place
of
ea
and
in
what
manner
even
the
legends
of
that
god
were
made
over
to
him
so
that
at
last
he
came
to
be
regarded
as
not
only
the
national
god
of
babylonia
but
the
creator
of
the
world
and
of
mankind
he
it
was
who
at
the
pleading
of
the
other
gods
confronted
the
grisly
tiawath
and
having
defeated
and
slain
her
formed
the
earth
out
of
her
body
and
its
inhabitants
out
of
his
own
blood
it
is
almost
certain
that
this
cosmological
myth
was
at
one
time
recounted
of
ea
and
perhaps
even
at
an
earlier
date
of
bel
the
transfer
of
power
from
ea
to
merodach
however
was
skilfully
arranged
by
the
priesthood
for
they
made
merodach
the
son
of
ea
so
that
he
would
naturally
inherit
his
attributes
in
this
transfer
we
observe
the
passing
of
the
supremacy
of
the
city
of
eridu
to
that
of
babylon
ea
or
oannes
the
god
of
eridu
stood
for
the
older
and
more
southerly
civilization
of
the
babylonian
race
whilst
merodach
patron
god
of
babylon
a
very
different
type
of
deity
represented
the
newer
political
power
originally
merodach
appears
to
have
been
a
personifying
more
especially
the
sun
of
the
springtime
thus
he
was
a
fitting
deity
to
defeat
the
chaotic
tiawath
who
personified
darkness
and
destruction
but
there
is
another
side
to
him
the
agricultural
side
says
jastrow
in
babylonia
and
at
nippur
as
we
shall
see
there
developed
an
elaborate
lamentation
ritual
for
the
occasions
when
national
catastrophes
defeat
failure
of
crops
destructive
storms
and
pestilence
revealed
the
displeasure
and
anger
of
the
gods
at
such
times
earnest
endeavours
were
made
through
petitions
accompanied
by
fasting
and
other
symbols
of
contrition
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
with
the
angered
power
this
ritual
owing
to
the
religious
of
nippur
became
the
norm
and
standard
throughout
the
euphrates
valley
so
that
when
marduk
merodach
and
babylonia
came
practically
to
replace
and
nippur
the
formulas
and
appeals
were
transferred
to
the
solar
deity
of
babylon
who
representing
more
particularly
the
of
spring
was
well
adapted
to
be
viewed
as
the
one
to
bring
blessings
and
favours
after
the
sorrows
and
tribulations
of
the
stormy
season
strange
as
it
will
appear
although
he
was
patron
god
of
babylon
he
did
not
originate
in
that
city
but
in
eridu
the
city
of
ea
and
probably
this
is
the
reason
why
he
was
first
regarded
as
the
son
of
ea
he
is
also
directly
associated
with
shamash
the
chief
of
the
later
pantheon
and
is
often
addressed
as
the
of
and
of
subterranean
fountains
in
appearance
he
is
usually
drawn
with
tongues
of
fire
proceeding
from
his
person
thus
indicating
his
solar
character
at
other
times
he
is
represented
as
standing
above
the
watery
deep
with
a
horned
creature
at
his
feet
which
also
occasionally
serves
to
symbolize
ea
it
is
noteworthy
too
that
his
temple
at
babylon
bore
the
same
name
lofty
house
as
did
ea
sanctuary
at
eridu
we
find
among
the
cuneiform
texts
a
copy
of
an
older
babylonian
text
an
interesting
little
poem
which
shows
how
merodach
attracted
the
attributes
of
the
other
gods
to
himself
ea
is
the
marduk
or
merodach
of
canals
ninib
is
the
marduk
of
strength
nergal
is
the
marduk
of
war
zamama
is
the
marduk
of
battle
enlil
is
the
marduk
of
sovereignty
and
control
nebo
is
the
marduk
of
possession
sin
is
the
marduk
of
illumination
of
the
night
shamash
is
the
marduk
of
judgments
adad
is
the
marduk
of
rain
tishpak
is
the
marduk
of
the
host
gal
is
the
marduk
of
strength
shukamunu
is
the
marduk
of
the
harvest
this
would
seem
as
if
merodach
had
absorbed
the
characteristics
of
all
the
other
gods
of
any
importance
so
successfully
that
he
had
almost
established
his
position
as
the
sole
deity
in
babylonia
and
that
therefore
some
degree
of
monotheism
had
been
arrived
at
a
ceremony
on
the
first
day
of
the
babylonian
new
year
an
assembly
of
the
gods
was
held
at
babylon
when
all
the
principal
gods
were
grouped
round
merodach
in
precisely
the
same
manner
in
which
the
king
was
surrounded
by
the
nobility
and
his
officials
for
many
ancient
faiths
imagined
that
the
polity
of
earth
merely
mirrored
that
of
heaven
that
as
paracelsus
would
have
said
the
earth
was
the
microcosm
of
the
heavenly
macrocosm
as
above
so
below
the
ceremony
in
question
consisted
in
the
lesser
deities
paying
homage
to
merodach
as
their
liege
lord
in
this
council
too
they
decided
the
political
action
of
babylonia
for
the
coming
year
it
is
thought
that
the
babylonian
priests
at
stated
intervals
enacted
the
myth
of
the
slaughter
of
tiawath
this
is
highly
probable
as
in
greece
and
egypt
the
myths
of
persephone
and
osiris
were
represented
dramatically
before
a
select
audience
of
initiates
we
see
that
these
representations
are
nearly
always
made
in
the
case
of
divinities
who
represent
corn
or
vegetation
as
a
whole
or
the
fructifying
power
of
springtime
the
name
of
merodach
consort
zarpanitum
was
rendered
by
the
priesthood
as
producing
to
mark
her
connexion
with
the
god
who
was
responsible
for
the
spring
revival
merodach
ideograph
is
the
sun
and
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
he
was
first
and
last
a
solar
god
the
name
originally
amaruduk
probably
signifies
young
steer
of
day
which
seems
to
be
a
figure
for
the
morning
sun
he
was
also
called
asari
which
may
be
compared
with
asar
the
egyptian
name
of
osiris
other
names
given
him
are
glorious
incantation
and
meragaga
glorious
charm
both
of
which
refer
to
the
circumstance
that
he
obtained
from
ea
his
father
certain
charms
and
incantations
which
restored
the
sick
to
health
and
exercised
a
beneficial
influence
upon
mankind
merodach
was
supposed
to
have
a
court
of
his
own
above
the
sky
where
he
was
attended
to
by
a
host
of
ministering
deities
some
superintended
his
food
and
drink
supply
while
others
saw
to
it
that
water
for
his
hands
was
always
ready
he
had
also
and
even
attendant
hounds
and
it
is
thought
that
the
satellites
of

the
planet
which
represented
him
may
have
been
dimly
visible
to
those
among
the
chaldean
who
were
gifted
with

sight
these
dogs
were
called
ukkumu
akkulu
iksuda

iltehu
it
is
not
known
whether
these
were
supposed
to
assist
him
in
shepherding
his
flock
or
in
the
chase
and
their
names
seem
appropriate
either
for

hunting
hounds
chapter
vii
the
pantheon
of
assyria
the
pantheon
of
assyria
as
befitted
the
religious
system
of
a
nation
of
soldiers
was
more
highly
organized
than
that
of
the
kindred
people
of
babylonia
the
ranks
and
relationships
of
the
gods
who
comprised
it
were
more
definitely
fixed
it
was
considerably
more
compact
than
that
of
the
southern
kingdom
and
its
lesser
luminaries
were
fewer
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
deities
of
the
assyrians
were
practically
identical
in
every
respect
with
those
of
the
babylonians
with
the
single
exception
of
asshur
who
equated
with
merodach
with
all
due
respect
to
practical
assyriologists
the
student
of
comparative
religion
may
perhaps
be
granted
leave
to
take
exception
to
such
a
statement
ethnological
differences
and
these
certainly
existed
between
the
peoples
of
the
northern
and
southern
climatic
conditions
a
different
political
environment
all
these
as
well
as
other
considerations
as
important
if
less
obvious
must
have
effected
almost
radical
changes
in
the
ideas
of
the
gods
as
conceived
by
the
assyrians
exactly
what
these
changes
were
we
shall
probably
never
know
they
are
scarcely
likely
to
be
revealed
by
inscriptions
or
sacred
writings
which
undoubtedly
conserve
for
us
little
more
than
the
purely
ecclesiastical
always
anxious
to
embalm
with
scrupulous
care
the
cherished
theological
beliefs
of
an
older
day
but
little
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
a
people
can
survive
in
priestly
inscriptions
and
the
labours
of
priestly
copyists
nor
is
it
safe
or
scientific
to
endorse
the
character
of
the
faith
of
a
race
by
comparison
or
analogy
with
that
of
a
neighbouring
folk
if
a
striking
example
were
required
of
the
danger
of
such
a
proceeding
it
might
be
found
in
the
vain
attempt
to
discover
an
exact
parallel
between
the
religious
systems
of
ancient
mexico
and
those
of
guatemala
and
yucatan
the
of
the
more
northerly
group
of
people
had
evolved
a
separate
system
of
worship
for
each
pueblo
or
town
the
deities
of
which
with
minor
differences
were
substantially
identical
but
when
the
pantheons
of
the
more
southerly
region
come
to
be
examined
it
will
be
found
that
although
the
gods
which
figure
in
them
spring
apparently
from
the
same
stock
as
those
of
the
mexican
people
and
even
possess
names
which
are
mere
translations
of
those
of
the
gods
of
mexico
their
attributes
and
characteristics
differ
profoundly
from
those
of
their
mexican
congeners
the
reason
for
this
dissimilarity
is
to
be
found
in
variations
of
climate
culture
and
politics
three
sure
factors
in
the
modification
of
religion
if
then
we
are
satisfied
that
such
differences
existed
in
the
religious
systems
of
two
almost
as
closely
connected
as
were
the
peoples
of
babylonia
and
assyria
may
we
not
be
pardoned
for
the
supposition
that
similar
divergences
existed
between
the
faiths
of
the
two
great
races
of
chaldea
we
find
in
the
assyrian
pantheon
numerous
foreign
deities
whom
the
assyrian
kings
included
among
the
national
gods
by
right
of
conquest
these
we
shall
deal
with
later
it
will
suffice
for
the
present
to
mention
who
speaks
of
the
capture
of
twenty
gods
of
the
elamites
it
was
of
course
only
upon
the
rise
of
a
distinct
assyrian
empire
that
the
religion
of
the
northern
kingdom
acquired
traits
that
distinguished
it
from
that
of
babylonia
having
outlined
the
reasons
for
the
differences
which
we
believe
to
have
existed
between
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
faiths
let
us
briefly
consider
the
variation
of
type
between
the
two
peoples
which
must
have
caused
this
divergence
the
languages
of
the
two
races
were
not
more
distinct
than
the
dialects
of
northern
and
southern
england
indeed
among
scholars
they
are
designated
by
the
common
name
of
assyrian
but
the
assyrians
had
a
pure
strain
of
that
semitic
blood
which
has
done
so
much
to
systematize
religions
ancient
and
modern
the
semite
can
not
content
himself
with
it
is
essential
to
his
very
life
that
he
must
feel
himself
upon
sure
religious
ground
he
hates
doubt
and
despises
the
doubter
at
an
early
time
in
his
ancient
career
he
had
so
securely
systematized
religion
as
to
supply
the
earliest
instances
of
pure
dogma
there
followed
the
relentless
abjuration
of
all
the
troublous
circumstances
of
mistrust
a
code
founded
upon
the
rock
of
unquestioning
faith
was
instituted
and
in
the
religious
systems
of
babylonia
and
especially
of
assyria
we
observe
a
portion
of
the
process
of
evolution
which
assisted
in
the
upbuilding
of
a
narrow
yet
highly
spiritualized
system
the
great
gods
in
assyria
were
even
more
omnipotent
than
in
babylonia
one
cause
contributing
to
this
was
the
absorption
of
the
minor
local
cults
by
deities
associated
with
the
great
centres
of
assyrian
life
early
religion
is
extremely
sensitive
to
political
change
and
as
a
race
evolves
from
the
tribal
or
local
state
and
bands
itself
into
a
nation
so
the
local
gods
become
national
and
centralized
probably
in
the
great
deity
of
the
most
politically
active
city
in
the
state
nor
is
it
essential
to
this
process
that
the
deities
absorbed
should
be
of
a
like
nature
with
the
absorbing
god
quite
often
a
divinity
assumes
the
name
and
attributes
of
one
with
whom
he
had
little
in
common
asshur
the
state
religion
of
assyria
centres
in
asshur
nor
was
any
deity
ever
so
closely
identified
with
an
empire
as
he
on
the
fall
of
the
assyrian
state
asshur
fell
with
it
moreover
all
the
gods
of
assyria
may
be
said
to
have
been
combined
in
his
person
in
babylonia
merodach
was
a
leader
of
hosts
in
assyria
asshur
personified
these
hosts
that
is
the
other
assyrian
gods
had
become
attributes
of
asshur
and
we
can
only
understand
the
remaining
assyrian
gods
if
we
regard
them
as
lesser
asshurs
so
to
speak
as
broken
lights
of
the
great
god
of
battle
and
conquest
illustration
symbols
of
the
god
from
belief
and
practice
in
babylonia
and
by
jastrow
sons
asshur
originated
in
the
city
of
his
name
situated
on
the
west
bank
of
the
tigris
not
far
from
the
point
where
the
lower
zab
flows
into
that
river
it
was
not
of
course
until
the
rise
of
this
city
to
political
that
its
god
figured
as
there
are
conflicting
estimates
as
regards
his
original
nature
some
authorities
holding
that
he
was
lunar
others
that
he
symbolized
fire
or
water
the
facts
however
point
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
solar
in
character
merodach
had
chiefly
been
worshipped
in
babylon
as
other
babylonian
territories
became
subject
to
that
city
we
do
not
find
them
placing
the
god
of
babylon
above
their
own
local
god
but
it
was
different
with
asshur
we
find
temples
to
him
broadcast
over
assyria
indeed
as
assyrian
history
advances
we
see
different
cities
alluded
to
as
the
chief
centre
of
his
worship
and
he
resides
now
at
asshur
now
at
calah
now
at
nineveh
now
at
khorsabad
wherever
the
kings
of
assyria
took
up
their
official
residence
there
asshur
was
adored
and
there
he
was
supposed
to
dwell
he
was
not
symbolized
by
an
idol
or
any
statue
which
would
serve
to
give
the
populace
an
idea
of
his
physical
likeness
but
was
represented
by
a
standard
consisting
of
a
pole
surrounded
by
a
disc
enclosed
with
two
wings
above
the
disc
was
the
figure
of
a
warrior
with
bent
bow
and
arrow
on
string
this
well
symbolized
the
military
nature
of
the
assyrian
nation
and
of
its
tutelar
deity
at
the
same
time
indications
are
not
wanting
that
this
pole
and
its
accompanying
symbols
are
the
remains
of
a
upon
which
has
been
superimposed
the
anthropomorphic
figure
of
a
or
the
pole
is
a
favourite
vehicle
for
carrying
the
totem
symbols
into
battle
and
it
looks
here
as
if
the
sun
had
at
one
time
been
regarded
as
a
tribal
totem
the
figure
of
the
archer
at
the
top
seems
representative
of
a
or
a
mythic
character
frequently
associated
with
the
sun
that
warrior
by
virtue
of
his
possession
of
the
lightning
arrow
the
is
often
accepted
as
a
god
of
war
the
etymology
of
the
name
of
asshur
throws
little
light
upon
his
character
as
a
divinity
the
city
which
took
his
name
was
in
all
probability
originally
called
city
of
the
god
asshur
to
call
it
by
the
name
of
the
god
alone
would
not
be
unnatural
the
name
is
derived
from
a
root
meaning
be
gracious
and
therefore
means
gracious
god
good
god
but
there
are
indications
that
an
older
form
of
the
name
had
existed
and
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
form
anshar
has
priority
with
kishar
a
god
anshar
was
created
as
the
second
pair
of
deities
to
see
the
light
and
according
to
one
version
it
is
anshar
who
dispatches
anu
ea
and
finally
merodach
to
destroy
the
monster
tiawath
this
anshar
then
appears
as
possessed
with
authority
among
the
gods
but
we
find
no
mention
of
him
in
the
ancient
texts
and
inscriptions
of
babylonia
the
version
in
which
anshar
is
alluded
to
may
of
course
have
been
tampered
with
and
his
inclusion
in
the
creation
myth
may
be
regarded
as
a
concession
to
assyrian
greatness
indeed
in
one
creation
tablet
we
find
merodach
displaced
by
asshur
as
framer
of
the
earth
the
secret
of
assyrian
greatness
asshur
is
mentioned
in
the
oldest
assyrian
inscription
known
to
us
that
of
the
of
asshur
who
ruled
in
the
days
when
as
yet
the
offices
of
king
and
high
priest
were
undivided
indeed
when
the
title
of
had
come
into
use
some
years
later
the
monarchs
of
assyria
still
retained
the
right
to
call
themselves
of
the
god
asshur
the
entire
faith
in
and
dependence
on
their
beloved
deity
on
the
part
of
these
early
assyrian
rulers
is
touching
they
are
his
children
and
rely
wholly
upon
him
first
for
protection
against
their
cruel
enemies
the
kassites
and
afterwards
for
the
extension
of
their
growing
empire
no
wonder
that
with
such
a
faith
to
stimulate
her
assyria
became
great
faith
in
her
tutelar
god
was
indeed
the
secret
of
her
greatness
the
enemies
of
assyria
are
enemies
of
asshur
her
soldiers
are
warriors
of
asshur
and
their
weapons
are
weapons
of
asshur
before
his
face
the
enemies
of
assyria
tremble
and
are
routed
he
is
consulted
oracularly
as
to
the
making
and
conduct
of
war
and
he
is
present
on
the
but
the
solitary
nature
of
asshur
was
remarkable
originally
he
possessed
kith
nor
kin
neither
wife
nor
child
and
the
unnaturalness
of
his
splendid
isolation
appears
to
have
struck
the
assyrian
scribes
who
in
an
interesting
prayer
attempted
to
connect
their
divinity
with
the
greater
gods
of
babylonia
to
find
him
a
wife
ministers
a
court
and
messengers
a
prayer
to
asshur
the
king
of

asshur
as
conqueror
an
incident
which
well
illustrated
the
popularity
of
the
assyrian
belief
in
the
conquering
power
of
the
national
god
is
described
in
an
account
of
the
expedition
of
sargon
against
ashdod
stamped
on
a
clay
cylinder
of
that
monarch
reign
sargon
states
that
in
his
ninth
expedition
to
the
land
beside
the
sea
to
philistia
and
ashdod
to
punish
king
azuri
of
that
city
for
his
refusal
to
send
tribute
and
for
his
evil
deeds
against
assyrian
subjects
sargon
placed
ahimiti
nephew
of
azuri
in
his
place
and
fixed
the
taxes
but
the
people
of
ashdod
revolted
against
the
puppet
sargon
had
placed
over
them
and
by
acclamation
raised
one
yaran
to
the
throne
and
fortified
their
dominions
they
and
the
surrounding
peoples
sought
the
aid
of
egypt
which
could
not
help
them
for
the
honour
of
asshur
sargon
then
engaged
in
an
expedition
against
the
hittites
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
state
of
affairs
in
philistia
hearing
which
yaran
for
fear
of
asshur
fled
to
meroc
on
the
borders
of
egypt
where
he
hid
ignominiously
sargon
besieged
and
captured
the
city
of
ashdod
with
the
gods
wives
children
and
treasures
of
yaran
it
is
plain
that
this
punitive
expedition
was
undertaken
for
the
personal
honour
of
asshur
that
he
was
believed
to
accompany
the
troops
in
their
campaign
against
the
rebellious
folk
of
ashdod
and
that
victory
was
to
be
ascribed
to
him
and
to
him
alone
all
tribute
from
conquered
peoples
became
the
property
of
asshur
to
whom
it
was
offered
by
the
kings
of
assyria
even
the
great
and
proud
monarchs
of
this
warlike
kingdom
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
themselves
the
creatures
of
asshur
by
whom
they
live
and
breathe
and
by
whose
will
they
hold
the
royal
authority
symbolized
by
the
mighty
bow
conferred
upon
them
by
their
divine
master
that
these
haughty
rulers
were
not
without
an
element
of
affection
as
well
as
fear
for
the
god
they
worshipped
is
seen
from
the
circumstance
that
they
frequently
allude
to
themselves
as
the
sons
of
asshur
whose
viceroys
on
earth
they
were
asshur
was
indeed
in
later
times
the
spirit
of
conquering
assyria
personalized
we
do
not
find
him
regarded
as
anything
else
than
a
we
do
not
find
him
surrounded
by
any
of
the
gentler
attributes
which
distinguish
deities
nor
is
it
likely
that
his
cult
would
have
developed
had
it
lasted
into
one
distinguished
for
its
humanizing
influence
or
its
ethical
subtlety
it
was
the
cult
of
a
pure
and
simple
and
when
asshur
was
beaten
at
his
own
business
of
war
he
disappeared
into
the
limbo
of
forgotten
gods
as
rapidly
as
he
had
arisen
ishtar
in
assyria
next
to
asshur
in
the
affections
of
the
assyrian
people
stood
ishtar
as
a
goddess
in
assyria
she
was
absolutely
identical
with
the
babylonian
ishtar
her
favourite
shrines
in
the
northern
kingdom

and
the
temple
of
kidmuru

appear
to
have
admitted
her
babylonian
origin
or
at
least
to
have
confessed
that
theirs
was
originally
a
babylonian
ishtar
for
i
lays
emphasis
upon
the
circumstance
that
a
shrine
he
raised
to
ishtar
in
his
capital
is
dedicated
to
assyrian
ishtar
the
date
of
this
monarch
is
or
near
it
so
that
the
above
is
a
comparatively
early
allusion
to
ishtar
in
assyrian
history
the
ishtars
of
arbela
and
kidmuru
do
not
appear
in
assyrian
texts
until
the
time
of
thus
the
ishtar
of
nineveh
was
much
the
most
venerable
of
the
three
arbela
was
evidently
a
religious
centre
of
importance
and
the
theory
has
been
advanced
that
it
became
the
seat
of
a
school
of
prophets
connected
with
the
worship
of
ishtar
jastrow
in
his
of
babylonia
and
writing
on
this
point
says
it
is
quite
possible
if
not
probable
that
the
three
ishtars
are
each
of
independent
origin
the
of
kidmuru
indeed
i
venture
to
think
is
the
indigenous
ishtar
of
nineveh
who
is
obliged
to
yield
her
place
to
the
ishtar
upon
the
transfer
of
the
capital
of
assyria
to
nineveh
and
henceforth
is
known
by
one
of
her
epithets
to
distinguish
her
from
her
more
formidable
rival
the
cult
of
ishtar
at
arbela
is
probably
too
of
ancient
date
but
special
circumstances
that
escape
us
appear
to
have
led
to
a
revival
of
interest
in
their
cults
during
the
period
when
assyria
reached
the
zenith
of
her
power
the
important
point
for
us
to
bear
in
mind
is
that
no
essential
distinctions
between
these
three
ishtars
were
made
by
the
assyrians
their
traits
and
epithets
are
similar
and
for
all
practical
purposes
we
have
only
one
ishtar
in
the
northern
empire
ishtar
as
a
ishtar
was
frequently
placed
by
the
side
of
asshur
as
a
ere
she
left
the
plains
of
babylonia
for
the
uplands
of
assyria
she
had
evinced
certain
bellicose
propensities
in
the
gilgamesh
epic
she
appears
as
a
deity
of
destructive
and
spiteful
character
if
not
actually
of
warlike
nature
but
if
the
babylonians
regarded
her
first
and
foremost
as
the
great
the
assyrians
took
but
little
notice
of
this
side
of
her
character
to
them
she
was
a
veritable
valkyrie
and
as
the
assyrians
grew
more
and
more
military
so
she
became
more
the
and
less
the
of
love
and
agriculture
she
appeared
in
dreams
to
the
kings
of
assyria
encouraging
and
heartening
them
with
words
of
cheer
to
further
military
exploits
fire
was
her
raiment
and
as
became
a
goddess
of
battle
her
appearance
was
terrific
she
consumed
the
enemies
of
with
flames
still
strangely
enough
in
the
religious
texts
influenced
probably
by
babylonian
sources
she
was
still
to
a
great
extent
the
mild
and
bountiful
mother
of
nature
it
is
in
the
historical
texts
which
ring
with
tales
of
conquest
and
the
grandiloquent
boastings
of
conquering
monarchs
that
she
appears
as
the
leader
of
armies
and
the
martial
goddess
who
has
slain
her
thousands
and
her
tens
of
thousands
so
has
it
ever
been
impossible
for
the
priest
and
the
soldier
to
possess
the
selfsame
idea
of
godhead
and
this
is
so
in
the
modern
no
less
than
in
the
ancient
world
yet
occasionally
the
stern
assyrian
kings
unbent
and
it
was
probably
in
a
brief
interval
of
peace
that
alluded
to
ishtar
as
the
lady
who
loves
him
and
his
priesthood
sennacherib
also
spoke
of
the
goddess
in
similar
terms
it
is
necessary
to
state
that
the
name
or
title
of
belit
given
to
ishtar
does
not
signify
that
she
is
the
wife
or
consort
of
bel
but
merely
that
she
is
a
lady
for
which
the
title
is
a
generic
term
if
she
is
at
times
brought
into
close
association
with
asshur
she
is
never
regarded
as
his
wife
she
is
not
the
consort
of
any
god
but
an
independent
goddess
in
her
own
right
standing
alone
equal
with
asshur
and
the
dependant
of
no
other
divinity
but
it
was
later
only
that
she
ranked
with
asshur
and
purely
because
of
her
military
reputation
ninib
as
an
assyrian
such
a
deity
as
ninib
another
name
for
the
god
of
lagash
was
certain
to
find
favour
among
the
assyrians
by
virtue
of
those
characteristics
which
would
render
him
a
valuable
ally
in
war
we
find
several
kings
extolling
his
prowess
as
a
warrior
notably
i
and
who
allude
to
him
as
the
courageous
one
and
the
mighty
one
of
the
gods
his
old
status
as
a
god
in
which
he
was
regarded
as
overthrowing
and
levelling
with
the
ground
everything
which
stood
in
his
path
would
supply
him
with
the
reputation
necessary
to
a
god
of
battles
he
is
associated
with
asshur
in
this
capacity
and
brackets
them
as
those
who
fulfil
his
desire
but
ninib
chief
votary
was
who
commenced
his
annals
with
a
pæan
of
praise
in
honour
of
ninib
which
so
abounds
in
fulsome
eulogy
that
we
feel
that
either
he
must
have
felt
much
beholden
to
the
god
or
else
have
suffered
from
religious
mania
the
epithets
he
employs
in
praise
of
ninib
are
those
usually
lavished
upon
the
greatest
of
gods
only
this
proceeding
secured
immense
popularity
for
ninib
and
gave
him
a
social
and
political
vogue
which
nothing
else
could
have
given
and
we
find
the
grandson
of
employing
the
selfsame
titles
in
honouring
him
the
great
temple
of
ninib
was
situated
in
calah
the
official
residence
of
and
within
its
walls
that
monarch
placed
a
tablet
recording
his
deeds
and
a
great
statue
of
the
god
he
further
endowed
his
cult
so
that
it
might
enjoy
continuance
we
can
readily
understand
how
the
especial
favour
shown
to
such
a
god
as
ninib
by
an
assyrian
monarch
originated
asshur
would
be
regarded
by
them
as
much
too
popular
and
national
a
deity
to
choose
as
a
personal
patron
but
more
difficult
to
comprehend
are
the
precise
reasons
which
actuated
the
assyrian
kings
or
indeed
the
kings
of
any
similar
ancient
state
in
choosing
their
patrons
does
a
polytheistic
condition
of
religion
permit
of
the
fine
selection
of
patron
deities
or
is
it
not
much
more
probable
that
the
artful
offices
of
ecclesiastical
and
political
had
much
to
do
with
moulding
the
preferences
of
the
king
before
and
after
he
reached
the
throne
the
education
of
the
monarch
while
yet
a
prince
would
almost
certainly
be
entrusted
to
a
high
ecclesiastical
dignitary
and
although
many
examples
to
the
contrary
exist
we
are
pretty
safe
in
assuming
that
whatever
the
complexion
of
the
tutor
mind
that
of
the
pupil
would
to
some
extent
reflect
it
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
resisting
the
conclusion
that
the
assyrian
kings
were
very
often
vulgar
parvenus
ostentatious
and
as
such
people
usually
are
and
that
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
they
upon
everything
ancient
and
possibly
everything
babylonian
just
as
the
later
romans
praised
everything
greek
ninib
as
but
ninib
ministered
to
the
amusement
of
his
royal
devotees
as
well
as
to
their
warlike
desires
we
find
invoking
him
before
commencing
a
long
journey
in
search
of
sport
and
i
who
was
a
doughty
hunter
of
lions
and
elephants
ascribes
his
success
to
ninib
who
has
placed
the
mighty
bow
in
his
hands
jensen
in
his
points
out
that
ninib
represents
the
eastern
sun
and
the
morning
sun
if
this
is
so
it
is
strange
to
find
a
god
representing
the
sun
of
morning
in
the
status
of
a
it
is
usually
when
the
reaches
the
zenith
of
the
heavens
that
he
slays
his
thousands
and
his
tens
of
thousands
as
a
variant
of
he
would
of
course
be
identified
with
tammuz
his
consort
was
gula
to
whom
erected
a
sanctuary

dagan
the
who
we
saw
was
the
same
as
oannes
or
ea
strangely
enough
rose
to
high
rank
in
assyria
some
authorities
consider
him
of
philistian
or
aramæan
origin
and
do
not
compare
him
with
ea
who
rose
from
the
waters
of
the
persian
gulf
to
enlighten
his
people
and
it
is
evident
that
the
region
contained
several
versions
of
the
origin
of
this
god
ascribing
it
to
various
places
in
the
assyrian
pantheon
he
is
associated
with
anu
who
rules
the
heavens
dagan
supervising
the
earth
it
is
strange
to
observe
a
deity
whose
sphere
must
originally
have
been
the
sea
presiding
over
the
terrestrial
plane
and
this
transference
it
was
which
cost
dagan
his
popularity
in
assyria
for
later
he
became
identified
with
bel
and
disappeared
almost
entirely
from
the
assyrian
pantheon
anu
anu
in
assyria
did
not
differ
materially
from
anu
in
babylon
but
he
suffered
as
did
other
southern
deities
from
the
worship
of
asshur
he
had
a
temple
in
asshur
own
city
which
was
rebuilt
by
i
years
after
its
original
foundation
he
was
regarded
in
assyria
as
lord
of
the
igigi
and
anunnaki
or
spirits
of
heaven
and
earth
probably
the
old
animistic
spirits
and
to
this
circumstance
as
well
as
to
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
the
old
triad
along
with
bel
and
ea
he
probably
owed
the
prolongation
of
his
cult
as
an
elemental
and
fundamental
god
opposition
could
not
possibly
displace
him
and
as
ruler
of
the
spirits
of
air
and
earth
he
would
have
a
very
strong
hold
upon
the
popular
imagination
gods
who
possess
such
powers
often
exist
in
long
after
the
other
members
of
the
pantheon
which
contained
them
are
totally
forgotten
and
one
would
scarcely
be
surprised
to
find
anu
lingering
in
the
shadows
of

any
record
of
such
lore
could
be
discovered

frequently
associated
with

usually
with

and
eausas
in
babylonia
ramman
ramman
enjoyed
much
greater
popularity
in
assyria
than
in
babylonia
for
there
he
exercised
the
functions
of
a
second
asshur
and
was
regarded
as
destruction
personified
says
an
old
assyrian
hymn
concerning
ramman
the
mighty
mountain
thou
hast
overwhelmed
it
at
his
anger
at
his
strength
at
his
roaring
at
his
thundering

gods
of

the
gods
of

earth
ascend
to

earth
into
the
horizon
of
heaven
they
enter
into
the
zenith
of
heaven
they
make
their
way
what
a
picture
have
we
here
in
these
few
simple
lines
of
a
pantheon
in
dread
and
terror
of
the
wrath
and
violence
of
one
of
its
number
we
can
almost
behold
the
divine
fugitives
crowding
in
flight
some
into
the
upper
regions
of
air
to
outsoar
the
anger
of
the
destroyer
others
seeking
the
recesses
of
the
earth
to
hide
themselves
from
the
fierceness
of
his
countenance
the
roar
of
his
thunderbolts
and
the
arrows
of
his
lightning
simple
almost
bald
as
the
lines
are
they
possess
marvellous
pictorial
quality
bringing
before
us
as
they
do
the
rout
of
a
whole
heaven
in
a
few
simple
words
the
weapons
of
ramman
are
lightning
deluge
hunger
and
death
and
woe
to
the
nation
upon
whom
he
visits
his
wrath
for
upon
it
he
visits
flood
and
famine
thus
his
attributes
as
a
are
brought
into
play
when
he
figures
as
a
war
deity
for
just
as
a
of
the
lightning
wields
it
as
a
spear
or
dart
in
the
fight
so
ramman
as
brings
to
bear
the
horrors
of
tempest
upon
the
devoted
head
of
the
enemy
so
highly
did
the
assyrian
kings
value
the
assistance
of
ramman
that
they
sacrificed
to
him
during
the
stress
and
bustle
of
a
campaign
in
the
field
they
liken
an
attack
of
their
troops
to
his
onslaught
and
if
they
wish
to
depict
the
stamping
out
of
an
adversary
his
up
as
chaka
zulus
were
wont
to
term
the
process
they
declare
that
their
men
swept
over
the
enemy
as
ramman
might
have
done
alludes
to
ramman
as
mightiest
of
the
gods
but
as
in
reality
that
phrase
was
employed
in
connexion
with
all
the
principal
deities
at
one
time
or
another
by
kings
or
priests
who
favoured
them
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
anything
more
is
intended
than
that
ramman
occupied
a
place
of
importance
in
the
assyrian
pantheon
the
worship
of
ramman
in
later
times
came
very
much
into
prominence
it
was
only
in
the
days
of
khammurabi
that
he
came
into
his
kingdom
as
it
were
and
even
then
his
worship
was
not
very
firmly
established
in
babylonia
with
the
rise
of
the
kassite
dynasty
however
we
find
him
coming
more
into
favour
and
his
name
bestowed
upon
babylonian
kings
he
seems
to
have
formed
a
triad
with
sin
and
shamash
and
in
the
hymn
of
khammurabi
we
find
him
appealed
to
along
with
shamash
as
lords
of
justice
nebuchadrezzar
i
appears
to
have
held
him
in
high
esteem
although
he
was
unfriendly
to
the
dynasty
which
first
brought
him
into
prominence
and
this
monarch
couples
him
with
ishtar
as
the
divinity
who
has
chiefly
assisted
him
in
all
his
great
undertakings
indeed
nebuchadrezzar
evinced
much
partiality
for
ramman
perhaps
feeling
that
he
must
placate
the
especial
god
of
those
he
had
cast
from
power
he
speaks
of
him
as
the
of
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
and
of
the
rains
from
heaven
the
place
of
ramman
origin
seems
obscure
we
have
already
dealt
with
his
manifestations
in
more
primitive
days
but
opinions
appear
to
differ
regarding
the
original
seat
of
his
worship
some
authorities
holding
that
it
was
muru
in
southern
babylonia
others
that
it
is
necessary
to
turn
to
assyria
for
traces
of
his
first
worship
his
cult
is
found
in
damascus
and
extended
as
far
south
as
the
plain
of
jezreel
as
milton
says
rimmon
whose
delightful
seat
was
fair
damascus
on
the
fertile
banks
of
abbana
and
pharphar
lucid
streams
he
also
the
house
of
god
was
bold
a
leper
once
he
lost
and
gained
a
king
ahaz
his
sottish
whom
he
drew
god
altar
to
disparage
and
displace
for
one
of
syrian
mode
whereon
to
burn
his
odious
offerings
and
adore
the
gods
whom
he
had
vanquish
this
later
theory
would
make
him
of
aramaic
origin
but
his
cult
appears
to
have
been
of
very
considerable
antiquity
in
assyria
and
it
might
have
been
indigenous
there
moreover
the
earliest
mention
of
his
worship
is
in
the
city
of
asshur
as
has
been
indicated
he
was
probably
a
or
a
god
but
he
was
also
associated
with
the
shamash
but
whatever
he
may
have
been
in
babylonia
in
assyria
he
was
certainly
the
first
and
foremost
a
babylonian
text
of
some
antiquity
contains
a
really
fine
hymn
to
ramman
which
might
be
paraphrased
as
follows
omitting
redundancies
o
lord
ramman
thy
name
is
the
great
and
glorious
bull
child
of
heaven
lord
of
karkar
lord
of
plenty
companion
of
the
lord
ea
he
that
rideth
the
great
lion
is
thy
name
thy
name
doth
charm
the
land
and
covers
it
like
a
garment
thy
thunder
shakes
even
the
great
mountain
and
when
thou
dost
rumble
the
mother
trembles
said
the
lord
addressing
his
son
ramman
son
spirit
of
wisdom
with
eyes
and
high
vision
full
of
knowledge
as
the
pleiades
may
thy
sonorous
voice
give
forth
its
utterance
go
forth
go
up
who
can
strive
with
thee
the
father
is
with
thee
against
the
cunning
foe
thou
art
cunning
in
wielding
the
great
and
small
oh
with
thy
right
hand
destroy
the
enemy
and
root
him
up
ramman
hearkened
to
the
words
of
his
father
and
took
his
way
from
the
dwelling
the
youthful
lion
the
spirit
of
counsel
in
later
times
in
babylonia
ramman
seems
to
have
typified
the
rain
of
heaven
in
its
beneficent
as
well
as
its
fertilizing
aspect
not
only
did
he
irrigate
the
fields
and
fill
the
wells
with
water
but
he
was
also
accountable
for
the
dreadful
tempests
which
sweep
over
mesopotamia
sometimes
he
was
malevolent
causing
thorns
to
grow
instead
of
herbs
the
people
if
they
regarded
him
in
some
measure
as
a
fertilizing
agent
also
seem
to
have
looked
upon
him
as
a
destructive
and
deity
quite
capable
of
desolating
the
and
up
the
land
his
roar
is
typical
of
him
filling
all
hearts
with
affright
as
it
does
and
signifying
famine
and
destruction
it
is
not
strange
that
mesopotamian
regions
should
have
had
so
many
deities
of
a
destructive
tendency
when
we
think
of
the
furious
whirlwinds
which
frequently
rush
across
the
face
of
the
land
raising
and
devastating
everything
in
their
track
ramman
was
well
likened
to
the
roaring
lion
seeking
what
he
may
devour
and
this
seems
to
have
symbolized
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
peasant
population
of
the
land
indeed
the
assyrians
impressed
by
his
destructive
tendencies
made
a
of
him
and
considered
his
presence
as
essential
to
victory
no
wonder
that
the
great
god
of
storm
made
a
good
illustration
attended
by
a
winged
mythological
being
from
the
palace
at
photo
mansell
and
shamash
the
cult
of
shamash
in
assyria
dates
from
at
least
when
pudilu
built
a
temple
to
this
god
in
the
city
of
asshur
he
entitled
shamash
protecting
deity
which
name
is
to
be
understood
as
that
of
the
god
of
justice
whose
fiat
is
unchangeable
and
in
this
manner
shamash
differed
somewhat
from
the
babylonian
idea
concerning
him
in
the
southern
kingdom
he
was
certainly
regarded
as
a
just
god
but
not
as
god
of
justice
a
very
different
thing
it
is
interesting
as
well
as
edifying
to
watch
the
process
of
evolution
of
a
god
of
justice
thus
in
ancient
mexico
tezcatlipoca
evolved
from
a
tribal
deity
into
a
god
who
was
beginning
to
bear
all
the
marks
and
signs
of
a
god
of
justice
when
the
conquering
spaniards
put
an
end
to
his
career
we
observe
too
that
although
the
greeks
had
a
special
deity
whose
department
was
justice
other
divinities
such
as
pallas
athene
displayed
signs
that
they
in
time
might
possibly
become
wielders
of
the
balances
between
man
and
man
in
the
egyptian
heavenly
hierarchy
maat
and
thoth
both
partook
of
the
attributes
of
a
god
of
justice
but
perhaps
maat
was
the
more
directly
symbolical
of
the
two
now
in
the
case
of
shamash
no
favours
can
be
obtained
from
him
by
prayer
or
sacrifice
unless
those
who
supplicate
him
monarchs
though
they
be
can
lay
claim
to
righteousness
even
i
mighty
conqueror
as
he
was
recognized
shamash
as
his
judge
and
naturally
as
the
judge
of
his
enemies
whom
he
destroys
not
because
they
are
fighting
against
tiglath
but
because
of
their
wickedness
when
he
set
captives
free
tiglath
took
care
to
perform
the
gracious
act
before
the
face
of
shamash
that
the
god
might
behold
that
justice
dwelt
in
the
breast
of
his
royal
servant
tiglath
in
fact
is
the
viceroy
of
shamash
upon
earth
and
it
would
seem
as
if
he
referred
many
cases
regarding
whose
procedure
he
was
in
doubt
to
the
god
before
he
finally
pronounced
upon
them
both
and
shalmaneser
ii
exalted
the
of
shamash
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
popularity
of
the
worship
of
ra
in
egypt
had
reflected
upon
that
of
shamash
in
assyria
it
must
always
be
extremely
difficult
to
trace
such
resemblances
at
an
epoch
so
distant
as
that
of
the
ninth
century
but
certainly
it
looks
as
if
the
ra
cult
had
in
some
manner
influenced
that
of
the
old
babylonian
sargon
pushed
the
worship
of
shamash
far
to
the
northern
boundaries
of
assyria
for
he
built
a
sanctuary
to
the
deity
beyond
the
limits
of
the
assyrian
empire
where
precisely
we
do
not
know
amongst
a
nation
of
warriors
a
god
such
as
shamash
must
have
been
valued
highly
for
without
his
sanction
they
would
hardly
be
justified
in
commencing
hostilities
against
any
other
race
sin
in
the
northern
land
we
do
not
find
sin
the
babylonian
extensively
worshipped
in
assyria
founded
a
temple
to
him
in
calah
and
sargon
raised
several
sanctuaries
to
him
beyond
the
assyrian
frontier
it
is
as
a
chiefly
that
we
find
him
depicted
in
the
northern
kingdom
why
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
unless
indeed
it
was
that
the
assyrians
turned
practically
all
the
deities
they
borrowed
from
other
peoples
into
so
far
as
is
known
no
lunar
deity
in
any
other
pantheon
possesses
a
military
significance
several
are
not
without
attributes
but
these
are
caused
chiefly
by
the
manner
in
which
the
moon
is
regarded
among
primitive
peoples
as
a
bringer
of
plague
and
blight
but
we
find
sin
in
assyria
freed
from
all
the
astrological
significances
which
he
had
for
the
babylonians
at
the
same
time
he
is
regarded
as
a
god
of
wisdom
and
a
framer
of
decisions
in
these
respects
equating
very
fully
with
the
egyptian
thoth
alludes
to
sin
as
son
of
bel
just
as
he
is
alluded
to
in
babylonian
texts
thus
affording
us
a
clue
to
the
direct
babylonian
origin
of
sin
nusku
of
the
brilliant
sceptre
it
is
strange
that
although
we
know
that
nusku
had
been
a
babylonian
god
from
early
times
and
had
figured
in
the
pantheon
of
khammurabi
it
is
not
until
assyrian
times
that
we
gain
any
very
definite
information
regarding
him
the
symbols
used
in
his
name
are
a
sceptre
and
a
stylus
and
he
is
called
by
shalmaneser
i
bearer
of
the
brilliant
sceptre
this
circumstance
associates
him
closely
with
nabu
to
designate
whom
the
same
symbols
are
employed
it
is
difficult
however
to
believe
that
the
two
are
one
as
some
writers
appear
to
think
for
nusku
is
certainly
a
solar
deity
while
nabu
appears
to
have
originally
been
a
there
are
however
not
wanting
cases
where
the
same
deity
has
evinced
both
solar
and
aqueous
characteristics
and
these
are
to
be
found
notably
among
the
gods
of
american
races
thus
among
the
maya
of
central
america
the
god
kukulcan
is
depicted
with
both
solar
and
aqueous
attributes
and
similar
instances
could
be
drawn
from
mythologies
nusku
and
nabu
are
however
probably
connected
in
some
way
but
exactly
in
what
manner
is
obscure
in
babylonian
times
nusku
had
become
amalgamated
with
gibil
the
god
of
fire
which
perhaps
accounts
for
his
virtual
effacement
in
the
southern
kingdom
in
assyria
we
find
him
alluded
to
as
the
messenger
of
and
addresses
him
as
highly
honoured
messenger
of
the
gods
the
assyrians
do
not
seem
to
have
identified
him
in
any
way
with
gibil
the
even
was
absorbed
into
the
assyrian
pantheon
to
the
assyrians
babylonia
was
the
country
of
bel
and
they
referred
to
their
southern
neighbours
as
the
of
bel
this
of
course
must
be
taken
not
to
mean
the
older
bel
but
they
even
alluded
to
the
governor
whom
they
placed
over
conquered
babylonia
as
the
governor
of
bel
so
closely
did
they
identify
the
god
with
the
country
it
is
only
in
the
time
of
shalmaneser
ii
the
ninth
century
that
we
find
the
name
merodach
employed
for
bel
so
general
did
the
use
of
the
latter
become
of
course
it
was
impossible
that
merodach
could
take
first
place
in
assyria
as
he
had
done
in
babylonia
but
it
was
a
tribute
to
the
assyrian
belief
in
his
greatness
that
they
ranked
him
immediately
after
asshur
in
the
pantheon
the
assyrian
rulers
were
sufficiently
politic
to
award
this
place
to
merodach
for
they
could
not
but
see
that
babylonia
from
which
they
drew
their
arts
and
sciences
as
well
as
their
religious
beliefs
and
from
which
they
benefited
in
many
directions
must
be
worthily
represented
in
the
national
religion
and
just
as
the
romans
in
conquering
greece
and
egypt
adopted
many
of
the
deities
of
these
more
cultured
and
less
powerful
lands
thus
seeking
to
bind
the
inhabitants
of
the
conquered
provinces
more
closely
to
themselves
so
did
the
assyrian
rulers
believe
that
did
they
incorporate
merodach
into
their
hierarchy
he
would
become
so
assyrian
in
his
outlook
as
to
cease
to
be
wholly
babylonian
and
would
doubtless
work
in
favour
of
the
stronger
kingdom
in
no
other
of
the
religions
of
antiquity
as
in
the
assyrian
was
the
idea
so
powerful
that
the
god
of
the
conquered
or
subject
people
should
become
a
virtual
prisoner
in
the
land
of
the
conquerors
or
should
at
least
be
absorbed
into
their
national
worship
some
of
the
assyrian
monarchs
went
so
far
as
to
drag
almost
every
petty
idol
they
encountered
on
their
conquests
back
to
the
great
temple
of
asshur
and
it
is
obvious
that
they
did
not
do
this
with
any
intention
of
uprooting
the
worship
of
these
gods
in
the
regions
they
conquered
but
because
they
desired
to
make
political
prisoners
of
them
and
to
place
them
in
a
where
they
would
be
unable
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
them
or
assist
their
beaten
worshippers
to
war
against
them
in
the
future
it
may
be
fitting
at
this
point
to
emphasize
how
greatly
the
assyrian
people
as
apart
from
their
rulers
cherished
the
older
beliefs
of
babylonia
both
peoples
were
substantially
of
the
same
stock
and
any
movement
which
had
as
its
object
the
destruction
of
the
babylonian
religion
would
have
met
with
the
strongest
hostility
from
the
populace
of
assyria
just
as
the
conquering
aztecs
seem
to
have
had
immense
reverence
for
the
worship
of
the
toltecs
whose
land
they
subdued
so
did
the
less
cultivated
assyrians
regard
everything
connected
with
babylonia
as
peculiarly
sacred
the
kings
of
assyria
in
fact
were
not
a
little
proud
of
being
the
rulers
of
babylonia
and
were
extremely
mild
in
their
treatment
of
their
southern
subjects
very
much
more
so
in
fact
than
they
were
in
their
behaviour
toward
the
people
of
elam
or
other
conquered
territories
we
even
find
the
kings
alluding
to
themselves
as
being
nominated
by
the
gods
to
rule
over
the
land
of
bel
the
assyrian
monarchs
strove
hard
not
to
disturb
the
ancient
babylonian
cult
and
shalmaneser
ii
when
he
had
conquered
babylonia
actually
entered
merodach
temple
and
sacrificed
to
him
the
assyrian
bel
and
belit
as
for
bel
whose
place
merodach
usurped
in
the
babylonian
pantheon
he
was
also
recognized
in
assyria
and
i
built
him
a
temple
in
his
city
of
asshur
tiglath
prefixes
the
adjective
to
the
god
name
to
show
that
he
means
bel
not
sargon
too
who
had
antiquarian
tastes
also
reverts
to
bel
to
whom
he
alludes
as
the
mountain
the
name
of
the
god
following
immediately
after
that
of
asshur
bel
is
also
invoked
in
connexion
with
anu
as
a
granter
of
victory
his
consort
belit
although
occasionally
she
is
coupled
with
him
more
usually
figures
as
the
wife
of
asshur
and
almost
as
commonly
as
a
variant
of
ishtar
in
a
temple
in
the
city
of
asshur
i
made
presents
to
belit
consisting
of
the
images
of
the
gods
vanquished
by
him
in
his
various
campaigns
too
regarded
belit
as
the
wife
of
asshur
and
himself
as
their
son
alluding
to
belit
as
of
the
great
gods
a
circumstance
which
would
go
to
show
that
like
most
of
the
assyrian
kings
his
egoism
rather
overshadowed
his
sense
of
humour
in
pantheon
belit
is
placed
close
by
her
consort
asshur
but
there
seems
to
have
been
a
good
deal
of
confusion
between
belit
and
ishtar
because
of
the
general
meaning
of
the
word
belit
nabu
and
merodach
as
in
babylonia
so
in
assyria
nabu
and
merodach
were
paired
together
often
as
bel
and
nabu
especially
were
they
invoked
when
the
affairs
of
babylonia
were
being
dealt
with
in
the
seventh
century
we
find
the
cult
of
nabu
in
high
popularity
in
assyria
and
indeed
iii
appears
to
have
made
an
attempt
to
advance
nabu
considerably
he
erected
a
temple
to
the
god
at
calah
and
granted
him
many
resounding
titles
but
even
so
it
does
not
seem
that
intended
to
exalt
nabu
at
the
expense
of
asshur
indeed
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
done
so
if
he
had
desired
to
asshur
was
as
much
the
national
god
of
the
assyrian
people
as
osiris
was
of
the
egyptians
nabu
was
the
patron
of
wisdom
and
protector
of
the
arts
he
guided
the
stylus
of
the
scribe
and
in
these
attributes
he
is
very
close
to
the
egyptian
thoth
and
almost
identical
with
another
babylonian
god
nusku
alluded
to
on
pages
sargon
calls
nabu
seer
who
guides
the
gods
and
it
would
seem
from
some
notices
of
him
that
he
was
also
regarded
as
a
leader
of
heavenly
or
spiritual
forces
those
kings
who
were
fond
of
erudition
paid
great
devotion
to
nabu
and
many
of
the
tablets
in
their
literary
collections
close
with
thanksgiving
to
him
for
having
opened
their
ears
to
receive
wisdom
ea
ea
was
of
course
accepted
into
the
assyrian
pantheon
because
of
his
membership
in
the
old
assyrian
triad
but
he
was
also
regarded
as
a
god
of
wisdom
possibly
because
of
his
venerable
reputation
and
we
find
him
also
as
patron
of
the
arts
and
especially
of
building
and
architecture
threefold
was
his
power
of
direction
in
this
respect
the
great
colossi
the
enormous
winged
bulls
and
mythological
figures
which
flanked
the
avenues
leading
to
the
royal
places
the
images
of
the
gods
and
lastly
the
greater
buildings
were
all
examples
of
the
architectural
art
of
which
he
was
the
patron
dibbarra
another
babylonian
deity
who
was
placed
in
the
ranks
of
the
assyrian
pantheon
was
dibbarra
the
who
can
only
be
called
a
god
through
a
species
of
courtesy
as
he
partook
much
more
of
a
demoniac
character
and
was
at
one
time
almost
certainly
an
evil
spirit
we
have
already
alluded
to
the
poem
in
which
he
lays
low
people
and
armies
by
his
violence
and
it
was
probably
from
one
of
the
texts
of
this
that
conceived
the
idea
that
those
civilians
who
had
perished
in
his
campaigns
against
babylonia
had
been
slaughtered
by
dibbarra
lesser
gods
some
of
the
lesser
babylonian
gods
like
damku
and
seem
to
have
attracted
a
passing
interest
to
themselves
but
as
little
can
be
found
concerning
them
in
babylonian
texts
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
take
much
notice
of
them
in
such
a
chapter
as
this
most
probably
the
assyrians
accepted
the
babylonian
gods
on
the
basis
not
only
of
their
native
reputation
but
also
of
the
occurrence
of
their
names
in
the
ancient
religious
texts
with
which
their
priests
were
thoroughly
acquainted
and
though
broadly
speaking
they
accepted
practically
the
whole
of
the
babylonian
religion
and
its
gods
in
entirety
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
of
these
by
their
very
natures
and
attributes
appealed
more
to
them
than
others
and
therefore
possessed
a
somewhat
different
value
in
their
eyes
from
that
assigned
to
them
by
the
more
people
of
the
southern
kingdom

and
by
jastrow
putnam
like
most
primitive
people
the
babylonians
originally
believed
the
stars
to
be
pictures
drawn
on
the
heavens
at
a
later
epoch
they
were
described
as
the
of
heaven
the
sky
was
supposed
to
be
a
great
vault
and
the
movements
observed
by
these
ancient
astronomers
were
thought
to
be
on
the
part
of
the
stars
alone
of
course
it
would
be
noticed
at
an
early
stage
that
some
of
the
stars
seemed
fixed
while
others
moved
about
lines
were
drawn
between
the
various
stars
and
planets
and
the
figures
which
resulted
from
these
were
regarded
as
omens
again
certain
groups
or
constellations
were
connected
with
such
lines
which
led
them
to
be
identified
with
various
animals
and
in
this
we
may
observe
the
influence
of
animism
the
babylonian
zodiac
was
with
the
exception
of
the
sign
of
merodach
identified
with
the
eleven
monsters
forming
the
host
of
tiawath
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
zodiacal
system
as
a
whole
originated
in
babylonia
the
knowledge
of
the
chaldean
astronomers
appears
to
have
been
considerable
and
it
is
likely
that
they
were
familiar
with
most
of
the
constellations
known
to
the
later
greeks
legend
of
the
origin
of
and
idolatry
the
following
legend
is
told
regarding
the
origin
of
astrology
by
maimonides
the
famous
jewish
rabbi
and
friend
of
averroes
in
his
commentary
on
the
in
the
days
of
enos
the
son
of
seth
the
sons
of
adam
erred
with
great
error
and
the
council
of
the
wise
men
of
that
age
became
brutish
and
enos
himself
was
of
them
that
erred
and
their
error
was
this
they
said
forasmuch
as
god
hath
these
stars
and
spheres
to
govern
the
and
hath
set
them
on
high
and
hath
imparted
honour
unto
them
and
they
are
ministers
that
minister
before
him
it
is
meet
that
men
should
laud
and
glorify
and
give
them
honour
for
this
is
the
will
of
god
that
we
laud
and
magnify
whomsoever
he
magnifieth
and
honoureth
even
as
a
king
would
honour
them
that
stand
before
him
and
this
is
the
honour
of
the
king
himself
when
this
thing
was
come
up
into
their
hearts
they
began
to
build
temples
unto
the
stars
and
to
offer
sacrifice
unto
them
and
to
laud
and
magnify
them
with
words
and
to
worship
before
them
that
they
might
in
their
evil
opinion
obtain
favour
of
their
creator
and
this
was
the
root
of
idolatry
for
in
process
of
time
there
stood
up
false
prophets
among
the
sons
of
adam
which
said
that
god
had
commanded
them
and
said
unto
them
worship
such
a
star
or
all
the
stars
and
do
sacrifice
unto
them
thus
and
thus
and
build
a
temple
for
it
and
make
an
image
of
it
that
all
the
people
women
and
children
may
worship
it
and
the
false
prophet
them
the
which
he
had
feigned
out
of
his
own
heart
and
said
that
was
the
of
that
star
which
was
made
known
to
him
by
prophecy
and
they
began
after
this
manner
to
make
images
in
temples
and
under
trees
and
on
the
tops
of
mountains
and
hills
and
assembled
together
and
worshipped
them
this
thing
was
spread
through
all
the
to
serve
images
with
services
different
one
from
another
and
to
sacrifice
unto
and
worship
them
so
in
process
of
time
the
glorious
and
fearful
name
was
forgotten
out
of
the
mouth
of
all
living
and
out
of
their
knowledge
and
they
acknowledged
him
not
and
there
was
found
on
earth
no
people
that
knew
aught
save
images
of
wood
and
stone
and
temples
of
stone
which
they
had
been
trained
up
from
their
childhood
to
worship
and
serve
and
to
swear
by
their
names
and
the
wise
men
that
were
among
them
the
priests
and
such
like
thought
that
there
was
no
god
save
the
stars
and
spheres
for
whose
sake
and
whose
they
had
made
these
images
but
as
for
the
rock
everlasting
there
was
no
man
that
did
acknowledge
him
or
know
him
save
a
few
persons
in
the
world
as
enoch
methusaleh
noah
shem
and
heber
and
in
this
way
did
the
world
work
and
converse
till
that
pillar
of
the
world
abram
our
father
was
born
speculations
of
the
chaldeans
to
arrive
at
a
proper
comprehension
of
babylonian
religious
doctrines
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
astrological
speculations
of
the
ancient
chaldeans
they
recognized
at
an
early
period
that
eternal
and
unchangeable
laws
underlay
planetary
motion
and
seem
to
have
been
able
to
forecast
eclipses
soon
also
did
they
begin
to
identify
the
several
heavenly
bodies
with
the
gods
thus
the
path
of
the
sun
was
known
as
the
of
anu
and
the
course
of
the
moon
and
planets
they
determined
with
reference
to
the
sun
ecliptic
or
pathway
it
is
strange
too
that
they
should
have
employed
the
same
ideograph
for
the
word
and
the
word
the
only
difference
being
that
in
the
case
of
a
god
they
repeated
the
sign
three
times
if
the
sun
and
moon
under
animistic
law
are
regarded
as
gods
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
stars
and
planets
must
also
be
looked
upon
as
lesser
deities
indeed
poets
still
use
such
an
expression
regarding
them
as
host
of
heaven
and
we
frequently
encounter
in
classical
authors
the
statement
that
the
stars
in
their
courses
fought
for
such
and
such
a
person
this
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
stars
possess
volition
and
even
although
omens
were
looked
for
out
of
their
movements
it
may
have
been
believed
that
these
were
the
outcome
of
volition
on
the
part
of
the
stars
themselves
as
deities
or
deific
individuals
again
we
can
see
how
the
idea
that
the
gods
reside
in
that
is
the
sky
arose
from
early
astrological
conceptions
the
gods
were
identified
in
many
cases
with
the
stars
therefore
it
is
only
natural
to
suppose
that
they
resided
in
the
it
is
indeed
one
of
the
most
difficult
matters
for
even
an
intelligent
and
enlightened
man
in
our
enlightened
age
to
dissociate
the
idea
of
god
from
a
residence
in
the
sky
or
up
there
the
idea
of
space
too
must
have
assisted
in
such
a
conception
as
the
residence
of
the
gods
in
the
upper
regions
of
air
the
earth
would
not
be
large
enough
for
them
but
the
boundless
vault
above
would
afford
them
plenty
of
space
in
which
to
dwell
again
the
sun
and
moon
being
gods
it
would
be
only
natural
for
the
other
deities
to
dwell
beside
them
that
is
in
the
of
anu
as
the
babylonians
called
the
sky
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
conception
of
a
pantheon
dwelling
in
the
sky
originated
in
theological
processes
forwarded
by
a
school
or
priesthood
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
this
was
so
and
the
possibilities
are
easily
covered
by
the
circumstances
of
the
animistic
theory
planets
identified
with
gods
jupiter
the
largest
of
the
planets
was
identified
with
merodach
head
of
the
babylonian
pantheon
we
find
him
exercising
control
over
the
other
stars
in
the
creation
story
under
the
name
nibir
ishtar
was
identified
with
venus
saturn
with
ninib
mars
with
nergal
mercury
with
nabu
it
is
more
than
strange
that
gods
with
certain
attributes
should
have
become
attached
to
certain
planets
in
more
countries
than
one
and
this
illustrates
the
deep
and
lasting
influence
which
semitic
religious
thought
exercised
over
the
hellenic
and
roman
theological
systems
the
connexion
is
too
obvious
and
too
exact
not
to
be
the
result
of
close
association
there
are
indeed
hundreds
of
proofs
to
support
such
a
theory
who
can
suppose
for
example
that
aphrodite
is
any
other
than
ishtar
the
romans
identified
their
goddess
diana
with
the
patroness
of
ephesus
there
are
indeed
traces
of
direct
relations
of
the
greek
goddess
with
the
moon
and
she
was
also
like
ishtar
connected
with
the
lower
world
and
the
sea
the
greeks
had
numerous
and
flourishing
colonies
in
asia
minor
in
remote
times
and
these
probably
assisted
in
the
dissemination
of
asiatic
and
especially
babylonian
lore
the
sun
was
regarded
as
the
shepherd
of
the
stars
and
nergal
the
god
of
destruction
and
the
underworld
as
the
sheep
probably
because
the
ruddy
nature
of
his
light
rendered
him
a
most
conspicuous
object
anu
is
the
pole
star
of
the
ecliptic
bel
the
pole
star
of
the
equator
while
ea
in
the
southern
heavens
was
identified
with
a
star
in
the
constellation
argo
fixed
stars
were
probably
selected
for
them
because
of
their
permanent
and
elemental
nature
the
sun
they
represented
as
riding
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
horses
and
we
frequently
notice
that
the
figure
representing
the
luminary
on
greek
vases
and
other
remains
wears
the
phrygian
cap
a
typically
asiatic
and
thus
assisting
proof
that
the
idea
of
the
sun
as
a
charioteer
possibly
originated
in
babylonia
lunar
worship
or
at
least
computation
of
time
by
the
phases
of
the
moon
frequently
precedes
the
solar
cult
and
we
find
traces
in
babylonian
religion
of
the
former
high
rank
of
the
the
moon
for
example
is
not
one
of
the
flock
of
sheep
under
guidance
of
the
sun
the
very
fact
that
the
calendar
was
regulated
by
her
movements
was
sufficient
to
prevent
this
like
the
red
indians
and
other
primitive
folk
the
babylonians
possessed
agricultural
titles
for
each
month
but
these
periods
were
also
under
the
direct
patronage
of
some
god
or
gods
thus
the
first
month
nizan
is
sacred
to
anu
and
bel
and
the
second
iyar
to
ea
siwan
is
devoted
to
sin
and
as
we
approach
the
summer
season
the
solar
gods
are
apportioned
to
various
months
the
sixth
month
is
sacred
to
ishtar
and
the
seventh
to
shamash
great
god
of
the
sun
merodach
rules
over
the
eighth
and
nergal
over
the
ninth
month
the
tenth
curiously
enough
is
sacred
to
a
variant
of
nabu
to
anu
and
to
ishtar
the
eleventh
month
very
suitably
to
ramman
the
god
of
storms
and
the
last
month
adar
falling
within
the
rainy
season
is
presided
over
by
the
seven
evil
spirits
none
of
the
goddesses
received
stellar
honours
the
names
of
the
months
were
probably
quite
popular
in
origin
thus
we
find
that
the
first
month
was
known
as
the
of
the
sanctuary
the
third
as
the
of
the
fifth
as
the
month
the
sixth
as
the
of
the
mission
of
ishtar
referring
to
her
descent
into
the
realms
of
allatu
the
fourth
month
was
designated
seed
the
eighth
that
of
the
opening
of
dams
and
the
ninth
was
entitled
fertility
while
the
eleventh
was
known
as
rain
we
find
in
this
early
of
the
ancient
babylonians
the
common
origin
of
religion
and
science
just
as
magic
partakes
in
some
measure
of
the
nature
of
real
science
for
some
authorities
hold
that
it
is
in
origin
so
does
religion
or
perhaps
more
correctly
speaking
early
science
is
very
closely
identified
with
religion
thus
we
may
believe
that
the
religious
interest
in
their
early
astronomy
spurred
the
ancient
of
babylonia
to
acquire
more
knowledge
concerning
the
motions
of
those
stars
and
planets
which
they
believed
to
be
deities
we
find
the
gods
so
closely
connected
with
ancient
chaldean
astronomy
as
to
be
absolutely
identified
with
it
in
every
way
a
number
was
assigned
to
each
of
the
chief
gods
which
would
seem
to
show
that
they
were
connected
in
some
way
with
mathematical
science
thus
ishtar
number
is
fifteen
that
of
sin
her
father
is
exactly
double
that
anu
takes
sixty
and
bel
and
ea
represent
fifty
and
forty
ramman
is
identified
with
ten
it
would
be
idle
in
this
place
to
attempt
further
to
outline
astrological
science
in
babylonia
concerning
which
our
knowledge
is
vague
and
scanty
much
remains
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
research
before
anything
more
definite
can
be
written
about
it
and
many
years
may
pass
before
the
workers
in
this
sphere
are
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
texts
bearing
on
chaldean
chapter
ix
the
priesthood
cult
and
temples
at
an
early
period
in
babylonian
history
the
priesthood
and
kingship
were
blended
in
one
office
and
it
is
not
until
after
several
centuries
from
the
beginnings
of
babylonian
history
as
we
know
it
that
the
two
offices
were
separated
indeed
long
afterward
the
monarchs
of
babylonia
and
assyria
appear
to
have
taken
especial
pleasure
in
styling
themselves
the
priests
of
such
and
such
a
deity
and
in
all
likelihood
they
personally
officiated
at
the
altars
of
the
gods
on
occasions
of
high
religious
sanctity
the
priesthood
in
general
was
called
which
may
mean
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
at
first
as
among
other
peoples
the
babylonian
priest
was
practically
a
it
was
his
business
to
secure
people
from
the
attacks
of
the
evil
demons
who
caused
disease
and
the
wiles
of
witches
and
to
forecast
the
future
and
discover
the
will
and
intentions
of
the
gods
it
is
quite
clear
how
such
an
official
as
this
came
to
be
known
as
the
for
it
would
seem
that
the
best
way
to
find
favour
with
the
gods
was
to
make
offerings
to
them
through
an
accredited
intermediary
indeed
the
early
priesthood
of
babylonia
appears
to
have
been
as
much
magical
as
religious
and
we
read
of
the
or
soothsayer
the
or
necromancer
the
or
sorcerer
and
the
or
charmer
whose
especial
functions
are
probably
outlined
in
their
several
titles
but
as
civilization
proceeded
and
theological
opinion
took
shape
religious
ceremonial
began
to
take
the
place
of
what
was
little
better
than
sorcery
it
has
been
said
that
magic
is
an
attempt
to
force
the
hands
of
the
gods
to
overawe
them
whereas
religion
is
an
appeal
to
their
protective
instincts
now
when
the
feeling
began
to
obtain
that
there
was
such
a
quality
as
justice
in
the
universe
and
when
the
idea
of
just
gods
had
an
acceptance
among
the
people
through
the
instruction
of
thinking
theologians
the
more
vulgar
practices
of
the
fell
out
of
favour
with
the
upper
classes
if
not
with
the
populace
and
a
more
imposing
ceremonial
took
the
place
of
mere
incantation
besides
being
founded
on
the
idea
of
mercy
as
opposed
to
mere
power
religion
has
invariably
recommended
itself
politically
speaking
to
the
class
of
mind
which
makes
for
immediate
and
practical
progress
as
apart
from
that
which
seeks
to
encourage
mere
speculation
as
the
ritual
grew
the
necessity
for
new
branches
of
the
priesthood
was
discovered
at
the
head
of
the
priestly
organization
was
the
and
each
class
of
priests
had
its
chief
as
well
the
priests
were
a
caste
that
is
it
is
probable
that
the
right
to
enter
the
priesthood
was
vested
in
certain
families
but
many
young
men
were
educated
by
the
priests
who
did
not
in
after
life
exercise
their
functions
but
who
became
scribes
or
lawyers
as
in
the
case
of
most
primitive
religions
the
day
of
the
priest
was
carefully
subdivided
it
was
made
up
of
three
watches
and
the
night
was
divided
into
a
similar
number
of
watches
three
relays
of
priests
thus
officiated
through
the
day
and
three
through
the
night
priestesses
were
also
known
in
babylonia
and
many
references
are
made
in
the
texts
to
the
women
some
of
these
were
exorcisers
and
others
like
the
greek
pythonesses
presided
at
oracular
shrines
the
cult
of
ishtar
in
especial
had
many
attendant
priestesses
and
these
were
of
several
classes
sacrifices
like
the
other
semitic
peoples
the
babylonians
attached
great
importance
to
the
question
of
sacrifices
professor
robertson
smith
has
put
it
on
record
in
his
of
the
that
sacrifice
among
that
race
was
regarded
as
a
meal
shared
between
the
worshipper
and
the
deity
this
view
of
sacrifice
is
almost
among
peoples
in
the
higher
stages
of
barbarism
if
not
in
those
of
savagery
there
is
no
source
from
which
we
can
definitely
discover
the
exact
manner
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
sacrifices
as
civilization
advanced
what
was
intended
for
the
god
almost
invariably
went
for
the
use
of
the
temple
certain
parts
of
the
animal
which
were
not
fit
to
eat
were
burned
to
the
glory
of
the
deity
the
blood
of
the
animal
may
however
have
been
regarded
as
more
directly
pleasing
to
the
gods
and
was
probably
poured
out
upon
the
altar
this
practice
is
distinctly
of
magical
origin
the
wizard
believes
that
the
dead
demons
and
supernatural
beings
in
general
have
a
special
desire
for
blood
and
we
remember
homer
vivid
description
of
how
when
the
trench
was
cut
and
the
blood
of
the
victims
poured
therein
the
shadowy
presentments
of
the
dead
flocked
about
it
and
devoured
the
steam
arising
from
the
sacrifice
in
some
cults
blood
alone
is
offered
to
the
gods
and
perhaps
the
most
striking
instance
of
this
is
afforded
by
the
religion
of
ancient
mexico
in
which
blood
was
regarded
as
the
pabulum
or
food
of
the
gods
and
the
body
of
the
victim
as
the
ceremonial
corpse
of
the
deity
to
be
eaten
by
his
worshippers

the
temples
of
babylonia
and
assyria
the
phase
is
characteristic
of
babylonian
religion
from
an
early
stage
more
than
years
before
the
final
extinction
of
the
cult
we
find
places
of
worship
being
raised
in
the
euphrates
valley
even
in
later
times
these
babylonian
structures
would
appear
to
have
been
built
for
practical
rather
than
æsthetic
purposes
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
epoch
they
were
of
the
crudest
description
mere
rude
structures
of
brick
without
an
attempt
at
architectural
elaboration
an
early
ideal
was
to
reproduce
in
miniature
the
of
all
lands
the
birthplace
of
the
gods
and
to
this
end
the
temple
was
erected
on
a
heap
of
earth
to
the
primitive
building
other
stories
came
to
be
added
till
in
pursuit
of
a
general
ideal
of
height
they
came
to
be
veritable
towers
of
babel
aspiring
to
reach
to
heaven
these
or
staged
towers
as
they
have
been
called
were
built
of
brick
and
were
quadrangular
in
form
their
four
sides
facing
north
south
east
and
west
respectively
their
sombre
and
unlovely
appearance
was
relieved
to
some
extent
by
the
use
of
brilliant
colourings
but
in
neither
form
nor
colour
need
we
look
for
any
particular
artistic
interest
nor
any
especial
religious
or
other
symbolism
though
attempts
have
been
made
both
in
later
babylonian
and
in
our
own
times
to
find
astrological
interpretations
of
these
by
and
by
the
zikkurat
came
to
be
more
of
a
than
a
temple
the
altars
and
sanctuary
proper
being
disposed
about
its
base
with
this
development
of
the
temple
area
a
new
phase
was
inaugurated
huge
courts
were
built
supported
by
brick
columns
and
enclosing
all
the
various
buildings
connected
with
the
cult
of
the
deity
to
whom
the
temple
was
dedicated
these
courts
which
were
for
the
most
part
open
to
the
sky
covered
a
large
area
as
much
perhaps
as
ten
or
twelve
acres
in
some
cases
brick
was
still
the
material
employed
in
their
structure
though
wood
was
used
for
gateways
and
for
roofs
for
the
smaller
temples
as
time
went
on
they
became
more
richly
decorated
precious
metals
and
woods
were
imported
for
their
adornment
and
draperies
and
coloured
bricks
were
employed
with
more
or
less
æsthetic
intent
in
some
assyrian
temples
stone
columns
were
employed
the
interior
of
the
temple
proper
consisted
of
a
central
hall
a
of
holies
wherein
was
set
the
statue
of
the
god
in
whose
honour
the
sanctuary
was
built
and
an
where
the
gods
of
the
pantheon
met
the
temples
of
babylonia
resemble
very
closely
those
of
ancient
mexico
and
central
america
for
just
as
the
chaldean
temple
was
evolved
from
the
idea
of
the
hill
so
was
the
mexican
or
of
god
originating
probably
in
a
rude
mound
of
earth
the
temple
in
both
countries
came
through
the
march
of
civilization
under
the
influence
of
architecture
proper
in
america
there
are
still
extant
many
links
in
the
chain
of
evolution
between
the
rude
and
the
carven
teocalli
but
in
the
case
of
babylonia
we
have
only
inference
to
support
the
theory
of
such
a
development
this
inference
is
however
of
a
very
powerful
character
commencing
probably
with
a
structure
we
find
both
the
mexican
and
babylonian
places
developing
a
second
then
a
third
fourth
fifth
and
even
sixth
stage
in
the
case
of
babylonia
and
sometimes
a
fourth
in
the
case
of
mexico
a
sharp
distinction
must
be
drawn
between
the
egyptian
pyramid
and
the
temples
of
babylonia
and
assyria
the
pyramid
of
the
nile
country
was
undoubtedly
developed
from
the
the
cairn
it
is
the
of
a
monarch
and
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
religious
worship
the
zikkurats
of
babylonia
and
the
teocallis
of
mexico
as
their
names
imply
were
unquestionably
religious
in
origin
and
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
burial
but
one
essential
difference
there
was
between
them
and
that
is
that
whereas
in
mexico
the
teocallis
seldom
possessed
interiors
this
was
very
frequently
the
case
with
the
temples
of
babylonia
it
is
true
that
the
mexican
temples
had
attached
to
them
buildings
called
but
these
appear
to
have
been
for
the
various
grades
of
priests
in
babylonia
on
the
other
hand
another
description
of
residence
arose
this
was
the
temple
proper
apart
from
the
zikkurat
or
tower
most
babylonian
cities
had
a
definite
religious
quarter
and
excavations
have
made
us
familiar
to
some
extent
with
the
plan
and
appearance
of
these
perhaps
the
best
known
example
is
that
at
nippur
the
extent
of
which
appears
to
have
been
about
sixteen
acres
a
large
court
was
lined
with
brick
columns
and
when
excavated
was
found
to
have
supported
a
wooden
roof
close
to
this
was
the
building
in
which
the
temple
records
were
kept
the
people
gathered
for
worship
in
a
second
court
of
sixty
wooden
columns
with
supports
and
capitals
of
metal
and
there
in
a
basin
specially
built
for
the
purpose
they
made
their
ablutions
before
offering
up
sacrifice
at
the
eastern
end
of
this
courtyard
was
placed
a
tent
containing
the
ark
this
kind
of
courtyard
may
be
said
to
be
characteristic
of
the
semitic
worship
as
there
was
undoubtedly
such
a
structure
in
most
hebrew
temples
this
court
of
columns
was
surrounded
by
chambers
which
probably
served
the
purpose
of
administrative
offices
and
perhaps
dwellings
for
the
priests
and
attendants
or
booths
for
the
sale
of
sacrificial
offerings
the
training
college
for
the
younger
priests
was
also
within
the
temple
area
as
were
the
astronomical
observatories
and
around
these
gathered
the
learned
of
the
district
just
as
they
did
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
to
dispute
concerning
religious
matters
and
to
split
theological
hairs
the
babylonian
priests
were
also
the
lawyers
of
their
period
and
the
courts
of
justice
were
probably
hard
by
the
temple
many
of
these
religious
areas
as
for
example
those
at
babylon
nippur
sippar
and
ur
must
have
been
so
extensive
as
to
have
constituted
what
were
in
reality
sacred
cities
the
whole
was
enclosed
by
a
containing
wall
and
even
the
several
divisions
of
the
temple
buildings
were
also
surrounded
by
lesser
walls
the
material
of
which
these
edifices
were
built
was
the
universal
one
of
brick
in
early
days
brick
was
employed
but
as
its
use
resulted
in
the
crumbling
and
speedy
destruction
of
most
of
the
edifices
composed
of
it
bricks
were
substituted
for
it
and
as
these
were
often
glazed
their
durability
was
much
enhanced
the
cement
used
to
hold
these
together
was
common
bitumen
found
in
great
quantities
in
babylonia
and
the
roof
was
usually
built
of
wood
cedars
from
lebanon
being
a
favourite
material
for
carpentering
from
the
restoration
plans
with
which
several
explorers
have
furnished
us
we
can
judge
how
stately
and
striking
the
interior
of
many
of
the
babylonian
temples
must
have
been
the
enamelled
bricks
the
woodwork
the
brilliant
precious
stones
the
gold
and
silver
inlaid
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
must
indeed
have
dazzled
the
beholder
the
semites
were
prone
to
the
use
of
bright
colours
and
as
it
was
the
aim
of
the
architects
to
outshine
the
sun
itself
in
their
interiors
we
can
judge
of
the
effect
draperies
and
rugs
were
probably
also
lavishly
used
the
wooden
gates
were
overlaid
with
bronze
in
high
relief
passing
through
them
the
worshipper
must
have
been
deeply
affected
by
the
wonderful
play
of
colour
and
shadow
combined
in
the
interior
the
vastness
of
length
and
height
would
inspire
him
with
deep
awe
and
the
curtain
screening
the
holy
of
holies
would
be
for
him
the
boundary
betwixt
the
human
and
the
divine
behind
this
curtain
was
probably
the
statue
of
the
god
and
the
chamber
which
contained
this
was
known
as
the
which
means
off
in
all
probability
no
one
had
access
to
it
but
the
king
and
high
religious
officials
it
was
indeed
the
holy
of
holies
a
stone
tablet
found
at
sippar
represents
the
god
shamash
seated
in
such
a
chamber
he
is
sitting
on
a
low
throne
and
before
him
is
an
altar
containing
a
symbol
of
the
a
monarch
and
priest
stand
before
him
the
decoration
of
such
a
chamber
was
lavish
in
the
extreme
the
floors
walls
and
ceiling
being
inlaid
with
precious
stones
and
in
some
cases
as
that
of
merodach
in
the
temple
of
babylon
the
statue
and
the
altar
in
front
of
it
were
of
solid
gold
the
great
the
history
of
in
babylonia
begins
at
an
early
date
we
find
sargon
and
calling
themselves
of
the
temple
of
in
nippur
gudea
was
probably
the
first
potentate
to
achieve
great
results
in
khammurabi
was
also
active
as
a
builder
of
sanctuaries
but
besides
planning
the
erection
of
new
temples
the
kings
of
babylonia
and
assyria
appear
to
have
been
zealous
in
the
restoration
and
improvement
of
the
older
temples
in
the
land
restoration
was
frequently
necessary
because
of
the
fact
that
many
of
the
older
shrines
had
been
built
of
brick
which
had
not
the
same
lasting
power
as
the
glazed
brick
dried
in
kilns
used
in
later
times
the
assyrian
conquerors
of
babylonia
considered
it
their
policy
as
well
as
their
pleasure
to
restore
many
of
the
ancient
shrines
of
the
land
they
had
subdued
and
in
doing
so
they
frequently
allude
in
their
records
to
the
age
of
the
temple
on
which
they
are
at
work
sometimes
providing
us
with
a
clue
to
the
date
of
its
foundation
in
this
way
we
can
trace
the
history
of
some
of
these
ancient
buildings
over
a
space
of
more
than
years
such
a
sanctuary
must
have
appeared
to
the
assyrian
monarch
who
rebuilt
it
as
an
edifice
erected
in
the
days
of
solomon
would
seem
to
us
thus
in
the
times
of
the
later
assyrian
kings
some
of
the
older
temples
would
have
behind
them
a
record
as
ancient
as
that
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
the
assyrian
restorers
of
these
ancient
fanes
refer
piously
to
their
original
builders
they
carefully
unearthed
the
old
which
they
preserved
and
clung
tenaciously
to
the
ritual
which
had
been
celebrated
in
the
temples
of
babylonia
from
very
early
times
there
are
many
long
lists
of
temples
in
existence
and
assuming
that
each
god
possessed
his
own
shrine
hundreds
of
temples
must
have
been
scattered
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
northern
and
southern
lands
these
were
probably
much
more
numerous
in
babylonia
which
was
older
and
whose
people
exhibited
a
greater
religious
feeling
the
temple
of
the
oldest
known
temple
in
babylonia
was
that
of
at
nippur
sacred
to
it
was
probably
founded
somewhere
about
or
even
at
an
earlier
date
before
the
time
of
sargon
we
find
the
rulers
of
nippur
embellishing
the
temple
there
the
climate
of
the
place
necessitated
frequent
repairs
and
by
reason
of
occasional
popular
revolutions
the
fabric
received
considerable
damage
we
find
urbau
about
building
a
zikkurat
in
the
temple
area
at
nippur
and
a
few
centuries
afterward
repairing
this
zikkurat
and
adding
a
new
shrine
saw
numerous
political
changes
and
when
foreign
dynasties
ruled
the
land
its
importance
waned
somewhat
but
later
alien
rulers
shrewdly
saw
the
advantage
of
restoring
its
rather
tarnished
splendour
and
we
find
several
kings
of
the
kassite
dynasty
so
far
honouring
it
as
to
place
within
its
confines
a
votive
object
from
elam
which
had
originally
been
placed
in
the
temple
of
ishtar
at
erech
whence
it
had
been
removed
by
an
elamite
conqueror
about
years
before
this
was
almost
as
remarkable
as
if
the
stone
of
destiny
the
lia
fail
in
westminster
abbey
were
to
be
restored
to
its
original
seat
in
ireland
the
temple
at
nippur
was
at
this
time
dedicated
to
bel
before
that
deity
was
ousted
by
merodach
almost
every
one
of
the
kassite
rulers
made
more
or
less
costly
additions
to
the
temple
at
nippur
and
from
their
several
inscriptions
we
can
follow
its
history
down
to
assyrian
times
about
the
twelfth
century
yielded
its
supremacy
to
it
was
sacked
and
partially
destroyed
until
later
restored
by
assyrian
monarchs
who
conscientiously
it
and
erected
many
new
buildings
within
its
area
but
during
the
new
babylonian
period
it
was
once
more
sacked
by
order
of
southern
rulers
and
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
century
its
history
comes
to
a
close
its
site
however
did
not
lose
its
sanctity
for
it
was
used
as
a
cemetery
and
partially
inhabited
till
the
twelfth
century
the
brilliant
house
this
outline
of
the
history
of
will
serve
for
that
of
many
other
babylonian
temples
the
temple
of
shamash
at
sippar
which
was
known
as
or
the
house
can
be
traced
back
as
far
as
the
days
of
this
was
also
restored
by
monarchs
of
the
kassite
dynasty
but
the
nomadic
tribes
who
ever
threatened
the
peace
of
babylonia
made
an
inroad
scattered
the
priesthood
and
destroyed
the
great
idol
of
shamash
it
was
nearly
years
after
this
that
the
house
was
restored
to
its
former
glory
by
nebuchadrezzar
rebuilt
portions
of
the
temple
as
did
the
last
king
of
babylonia
nabonidus
who
scandalized
the
priests
of
babylon
by
his
preference
for
the
worship
of
shamash
ur
the
we
shall
remember
that
one
of
the
principal
centres
of
the
cult
of
the
moon
was
at
ur
the
city
whence
came
abram
the
patriarch
and
it
is
probable
that
he
was
originally
a
another
such
centre
of
lunar
adoration
was
harran
these
places
were
regarded
as
especially
sacrosanct
as
the
was
more
ancient
than
that
of
the
sun
and
was
therefore
looked
upon
with
a
greater
degree
of
veneration
both
of
these
cities
possessed
temples
to
sin

and
in
them
astrology
and
stellar
observation
were
enthusiastically
carried
on
harran
was
more
than
once
overrun
by
the
fierce
nomadic
tribes
of
the
desert
but
its
prestige
survived
even
their
destructive
tendencies
the
temple
of
at
erech
dedicated
to
ishtar
was
one
of
the
most
famous
sanctuaries
in
babylonia
it
is
alluded
to
in
one
of
the
creation
legends
as
were
also
the
temples
at
nippur
as
bright
house
of
the
gods
the
twin
temples
the
temple
of
merodach
at
and
that
of
nabu
at
were
inseparably
associated
for
a
visit
to
one
practically
necessitated
a
visit
to
both
an
original
rivalry
between
the
gods

ended
in
a
species
of
amalgamation
and
together
they
may
be
said
to
have
symbolized
the
national
religion
of
babylonia
indeed
so
great
was
their
influence
that
it
can
scarcely
be
the

of

from
the
schools
which
clustered
around

as

it
was
perhaps
typical
of
the
race
that
its
places
of
worship
should
gradually
become
great
financial
centres
and
the
nuclei
of
trade
and

heavily
endowed
as
they
were
by
the

of

and
boasting

subsidies
and

they
also
had
at
their

an
army
of

so
forth
with
what

did
the

of
babylonia
pursue
a
commercial
career
it
could
scarcely
have
been

in
which
personal

bulked
largely
as
the
impersonal
temple
swallowed
up
all

have

enormous

when

think
of
the

nature
of

interiors
and
the
costly
character
of
the
rich

with
which

at
what

feasts
and
festivals
babylonian
religious
festivals
were
as
a
rule
periods
of
jubilation
and
rejoicing
each
god
had
his
own
day
of
festival
in
the
calendar
the
first
day
of
the
year
or
was
sacred
to
the
goddess
bau
gudea
who
had
made
his
favourite
attempted
to
him
into
this
festival
by
uniting
him
in
marriage
with
bau
and
he
offers
her
marriage
gifts
on
new
year
day
but
later
the
was
transformed
into
a
festival
to
merodach
the
circumstance
that
it
was
celebrated
in
the
first
month
of
the
year
shows
that
it
did
not
originally
belong
to
merodach
whose
month
was
marcheshuan
the
eighth
but
it
is
eloquent
of
his
popularity
that
the
great
new
feast
should
have
been
dedicated
to
him
it
seems
to
have
lasted
for
at
least
ten
or
twelve
days
as
has
already
been
described
the
union
of
nabu
and
merodach
father
and
son
was
solemnly
celebrated
nabu
piously
paying
a
visit
to
his
father
sanctuary
the
other
gods
were
supposed
to
assemble
in
spirit
in
merodach
temple
to
witness
the
ceremony
and
afterwards
the
priests
of
merodach
escorted
the
idol
of
nabu
back
to
its
shrine
themselves
carrying
the
image
of
their
deity
to
behold
this
festival
which
was
celebrated
with
all
possible
magnificence
people
flocked
from
all
parts
of
babylonia
the
king
approaching
the
statue
of
the
god
seized
its
hands
in
token
of
covenant
and
in
later
times
assyrian
monarchs
in
order
to
legitimatize
themselves
as
rulers
of
babylonia
went
through
this
ceremony
which
came
to
be
recognized
as
duly
fulfilling
their
claims
to
sovereignty
in
the
southern
land
but
whereas
they
went
through
the
ceremony
once
only
the
kings
of
babylonia
celebrated
it
annually
with
the
intensest
possible
devotion
the
chamber
of
fates
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
festival
all
the
gods
were
thought
to
assemble
in
merodach
of
fates
to
hearken
to
merodach
decree
concerning
the
fates
of
men
for
the
ensuing
year
this
remarkable
apartment
was
regarded
as
the
reproduction
of
the
interior
of
the
great
mountain
wherein
the
gods
met
in
council
just
as
the
zikkurat
was
thought
to
typify
that
mountain
itself
it
was
situated
in
a
special
portion
of
the
known
as
the
and
among
its
sacred
names
is
one
which
may
be
translated
chamber
which
shows
that
it
must
have
been
lavishly
decorated
or
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
proper
of
the
babylonian
gods
it
is
situated
in
the
east
in
the
mountain
of
the
sunrise
not
far
from
the
edge
of
the
world
where
it
was
bounded
by
the
waters
of
the
great
deep
it
is
in
fact
the
chamber
where
the
sun
takes
his
rise
lamentation
rituals
on
the
occasion
of
any
national
or
popular
disaster
such
as
defeat
in
war
the
appearance
of
a
pestilence
or
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
or
moon
a
certain
formula
of
lamentation
was
gone
through
which
was
thought
to
have
the
effect
of
lessening
or
averting
the
malign
influence
of
evil
powers
or
the
punitive
measures
of
an
angry
god
this
formula
varied
of
course
with
the
deity
or
demon
who
was
considered
to
have
caused
the
calamity
many
of
these
ancient
lamentations
are
written
in
the
sumerian
tongue
which
witnesses
to
their
great
antiquity
from
them
it
would
seem
that
the
babylonians
were
of
the
opinion
that
if
the
people
had
in
any
way
sinned
the
gods
averted
their
faces
from
them
and
departing
from
their
neighbourhood
left
them
a
prey
to
calamities
of
all
kinds
a
definite
ritual
accompanied
these
formulas
one
of
the
provisions
of
which
was
fasting
and
purification
ceremonies
of
a
very
elaborate
nature
were
also
celebrated
by
the
priests
probably
in
the
hope
of
symbolically
washing
away
the
sin
which
had
so
offended
the
gods
the
formula
most
in
use
in
these
propitiatory
ceremonies
was
that
which
obtained
in
the
sacred
city
of
nippur
and
particularly
in
the
temple
of
the
monotony
of
these
laments
is
typical
of
ancient
semitic
worship
they
describe
the
disasters
that
have
occurred
and
piteously
beg
that
the
gods
may
be
appeased
only
now
and
again
in
perusing
them
does
a
bright
line
or
a
picturesque
phrase
capture
the
eye
and
fire
the
imagination
a
paraphrase
of
one
of
them
may
well
characterize
the
whole
the
god
shepherd
of
the
people
is
implored
to
return
to
his
city
he
is
entreated
by
the
various
names
of
his
godhead
such
as
of
lands
of
the
faithful
word
of
vision
and
so
forth
each
separate
part
of
the
temple
area
is
alluded
to
in
the
request
that
he
will
return
the
great
gate
the
storehouse
and
the
other
religious
departments
a
touching
domestic
picture
is
drawn
of
the
deserted
homes
in
the
city
where
the
woman
could
say
to
her
young
husband
my
husband
where
she
could
say
to
the
young
child
my
child
where
the
maiden
could
say
my
brother
where
the
little
girl
could
say
my
father
there
the
little
ones
perish
there
the
great
perish
in
her
the
wind
holds
revel
her
streets
are
desolate
from
some
of
the
texts
it
would
appear
that
the
suppliants
were
ignorant
of
the
sin
they
had
committed
and
many
psalms
are
extant
in
which
the
stricken
one
appeals
fervently
to
the
gods
to
release
him
from
the
burden
of
his
unknown
sin
he
weeps
and
he
is
unable
to
restrain
himself
he
laments
earnestly
and
begs
through
the
priest
for
the
divine
mercy
these
appeals
always
end
in
the
same
way
that
is
in
the
pious
hope
that
the
heart
and
liver
of
the
god
may
be
appeased
with
the
babylonians
as
with
the
modern
armenians
to
whom
they
are
perhaps
related
the
liver
was
regarded
as
the
seat
of
the
emotions
occasionally
a
higher
intellectual
and
ethical
plane
is
reached
by
these
prayers
men
says
one
of
them
are
blind
which
of
them
knows
anything
they
do
not
even
know
good
from
evil
the
god
is
fervently
petitioned
not
to
cast
his
servant
off
he
is
in
a
deep
morass
and
he
earnestly
prays
that
the
deity
may
take
him
by
the
hand
may
change
his
sin
to
grace
and
permit
the
wind
to
carry
off
his
transgressions
the
terror
of
eclipse
the
terror
of
eclipse
of
the
sun
or
moon
was
a
very
real
one
to
the
ancient
babylonians
the
tablet
with
the
history
of
the
seven
evil
gods
or
spirits
though
much
mutilated
gives
us
a
hint
of
the
attack
made
by
them
upon
the
moon
they
dwelt
in
the
lower
part
of
heaven
and
were
rebellious
in
heart
shaped
like
leopards
serpents
and
angry
beasts
of
prey
they
went
from
city
to
city
on
the
wings
of
an
evil
wind
destroying
and
smiting
and
into
the
heaven
of
anu
they
burst
but
bel
and
ea
took
counsel
and
set
sin
the
moon
shamash
the
sun
and
ishtar
the
planet
venus
in
the
lower
part
of
heaven
to
govern
and
control
it
along
with
anu
no
sooner
had
this
been
accomplished
than
the
seven
evil
spirits
fiercely
attacked
the
but
bel
saw
the
peril
of
sin
and
said
to
his
attendant
the
god
nusku
carry
word
of
this
thing
to
the
ocean
to
the
god
ea
ea
heard
the
message
and
called
his
son
the
god
merodach
go
my
son
merodach
quoth
he
enter
into
the
shining
sin
who
in
heaven
is
greatly
beset
and
expel
his
enemies
from
heaven
it
is
impossible
to
decipher
the
context
from
the
mutilated
remains
of
the
tablets
but
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
the
pious
efforts
of
merodach
were
rewarded
with
success
an
eclipse
to
most
primitive
peoples
means
that
the
or
has
either
met
with
disaster
or
has
withdrawn
his
face
from
his
worshippers
the
monthly
waning
of
the
moon
made
the
ancients
believe
that
it
would
be
entirely
blotted
out
unless
the
god
was
pacified
thus
if
no
eclipse
took
place
it
was
considered
that
the
efforts
of
priests
and
people
had
prevailed
otherwise
they
were
held
to
have
failed
and
panic
ruled
supreme
in
a
certain
prayer
sin
is
adjured
not
to
withhold
his
face
from
his
people
the
day
of
the
monthly
disappearance
of
the
moon
is
called
a
day
of
distress
but
a
season
of
jubilee
followed
upon
the
advent
of
the
new
moon
next

chapter
x
the
magic
and
demonology
of
babylonia
and
assyria
like
other
primitive
races
the
peoples
of
chaldea
scarcely
discriminated
at
all
between
religion
and
magic
one
difference
between
the
priest
and
the
sorcerer
was
that
the
one
employed
magic
for
religious
purposes
whilst
the
other
used
it
for
his
own
ends
the
literature
of
chaldea
especially
its
religious
literature
teems
with
references
to
magic
and
in
its
spells
and
incantations
we
see
the
prototypes
of
those
employed
by
the
magicians
of
mediæval
europe
indeed
so
closely
do
some
of
the
assyrian
incantations
and
magical
practices
resemble
those
of
the
european
sorcerers
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
primitive
peoples
of
the
present
day
that
it
is
difficult
to
convince
oneself
that
they
are
of
independent
origin
in
chaldea
as
in
ancient
egypt
the
crude
and
vague
magical
practices
of
primeval
times
received
form
and
developed
into
accepted
ritual
just
as
early
religious
ideas
evolved
into
dogmas
under
the
stress
of
theological
controversy
and
opinion
as
there
were
men
who
would
dispute
upon
religious
questions
so
were
there
persons
who
would
discuss
matters
magical
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
terms
and
possessed
any
boundaries
for
them
nor
is
it
at
all
clear
that
they
do
for
us
in
this
twentieth
century
they
overlap
and
it
has
long
been
the
belief
of
the
writer
that
their
relations
are
but
represented
by
two
circles
which
intersect
one
another
and
the
areas
of
which
partially
coincide
the
writer
has
outlined
his
opinions
regarding
the
origin
of
magic
in
an
earlier
volume
of
this
series
and
has
little
to
add
to
what
he
then
wrote
except
that
he
desires
to
lay
stress
upon
the
identification
of
early
religion
and
magic
it
is
only
when
they
begin
to
evolve
to
branch
out
that
the
two
systems
present
differences
if
there
is
any
one
circumstance
which
accentuates
the
difference
more
than
another
it
is
that
the
ethical
element
does
not
enter
into
magic
in
the
same
manner
as
it
does
into
religion
that
chaldean
magic
was
the
precursor
of
european
mediæval
magic
as
apart
from
popular
sorcery
and
witchcraft
is
instanced
not
only
by
the
similarity
between
the
systems
but
by
the
introduction
into
mediæval
magic
of
the
names
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
gods
and
magicians
again
and
again
is
babylon
appealed
to
even
more
frequently
than
egypt
and
we
meet
constantly
with
the
names
of
beelzebub
ishtar
as
astarte
baal
and
moloch
whilst
the
names
of
demons
obviously
of
babylonian
origin
are
encountered
in
almost
every
work
on
the
subject
frequent
allusions
are
also
made
to
the
men
and
necromancers
of
babylon
and
to
the
of
chaldea
the
conclusion
is
irresistible
that
ceremonial
magic
as
practised
in
the
middle
ages
owed
much
to
that
of
babylon
our
information
regarding
chaldean
magic
is
much
more
complete
than
that
which
we
possess
concerning
the
magic
of
ancient
egypt
hundreds
of
spells
incantations
and
have
been
recovered
and
these
not
only
enlighten
us
regarding
the
class
of
priests
who
practised
magic
but
they
tell
us
of
the
several
varieties
of
demons
ghosts
and
evil
spirits
they
minutely
describe
the
babylonian
witch
and
wizard
and
they
picture
for
us
many
magical
ceremonies
besides
informing
us
of
the
names
of
scores
of
plants
and
flowers
possessing
magical
properties
of
magical
substances
jewels
amulets
and
the
like
also
they
speak
of
sortilege
or
the
divination
of
the
future
of
the
drawing
of
magical
circles
of
the
exorcism
of
evil
spirits
and
the
casting
out
of
demons
the
roots
of
science
in
these
babylonian
magical
records
we
have
by
far
the
most
complete
picture
of
the
magic
of
the
ancient
world
it
is
a
wondrous
story
that
is
told
by
those
bricks
and
cylinders
of
stamped
clay
the
story
of
civilized
man
first
gropings
for
light
for
in
these
venerable
writings
we
must
recognize
the
first
attempts
at
scientific
elucidation
of
the
forces
by
which
man
is
surrounded
science
like
religion
has
its
roots
deep
in
magic
the
primitive
man
believes
implicitly
in
the
efficacy
of
magical
ritual
what
it
brings
about
once
it
can
bring
about
again
if
the
proper
conditions
be
present
and
recognized
thus
it
possesses
for
the
barbarian
as
much
of
the
element
of
certainty
as
the
scientific
process
does
for
the
chemist
or
the
electrician
given
certain
causes
certain
effects
follow
surely
then
in
the
barbarous
mind
magic
is
of
the
nature
of
science
there
appears
a
deeper
gloom
a
more
ominous
spirit
of
the
ancient
and
the
obscure
in
the
magic
of
old
mesopotamia
than
in
that
of
any
other
land
its
mighty
sanctuaries
its
towers
seem
founded
upon
this
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
the
spoken
spell
the
reiterated
invocation
thousands
of
spirits
various
and
grotesque
the
parents
of
the
ghosts
and
goblins
of
a
later
day
haunt
the
purlieus
of
the
temple
battening
upon
the
remains
of
sacrifice
the
leavings
of
the
gorged
gods
flit
through
the
streets
and
disturb
the
rest
of
the
dwellers

no
type
of
supernatural
being
appears
to
have
been
unknown
to
the
imaginative
semites
of
old
chaldea
these
must
all
be
exorcised
or
placated
and
it
is
not
to
be
marvelled
at
that
in
such
circumstances
the
trade
of
the
necromancer
flourished
exceedingly
the
witch
or
wizard
however
the
unprofessional
and
detached
practitioner
with
no
priestly
status
must
beware
he
or
she
was
regarded
with
suspicion
and
if
one
fell
sick
of
a
strange
wasting
or
a
disease
to
which
he
could
not
attach
a
name
the
nearest
sorcerer
male
or
female
real
or
imaginary
was
in
all
probability
brought
to
book
priestly
wizards
there
were
at
least
two
classes
of
priests
who
dealt
in
the
occult
the
or
seers
and
the
or
wizards
the
caste
of
the
barû
was
a
very
ancient
one
dating
at
least
from
the
time
of
khammurabi
the
barû
performed
divination
by
consulting
the
livers
of
animals
and
also
by
observation
of
the
flight
of
birds
we
find
many
of
the
kings
of
babylonia
consulting
this
class
of
soothsayer
sennacherib
for
example
sought
from
the
barû
the
cause
of
his
father
violent
death
the
asipû
on
the
other
hand
was
the
remover
of
taboo
and
bans
of
all
sorts
he
chanted
the
rites
described
in
the

a

myth
the
assyrian
physician
had
perforce
to
be
something
of
a
demonologist
as
possession
by
devils
was
held
to
be
the
cause
of
divers
diseases
and
we
find
incantations
sprinkled
among
prescriptions
occasionally
too
we
come
upon
the
of
a
or
dip
momentarily
into
myth
as
in
a
prescription
for
the
toothache
compounded
of
fermented
drink
the
plant
and
oil
probably
as
efficacious
in
the
case
of
that
malady
as
most
modern
ones
are
the
story
attached
to
the
cure
is
as
follows
when
anu
had
created
the
heavens
the
earth
created
the
rivers
the
rivers
the
canals
and
the
canals
the
marshes
which
in
turn
created
the
worm
and
the
worm
came
weeping

ea
saying
what

thou

what

thou
give

for

i
will

bah
replied
the

what

or
what

drink
among
the
teeth
and
batten
on
the
gums
that
i
may
devour
the
blood
of
the

and
the
strength
thereof
this
tale
alludes
to
a
babylonian
superstition
that
worms
consume
the
teeth
the
word
of
power
as
in
egypt
the
word
of
power
was
held
in
great
reverence
by
the
magicians
of
chaldea
who
believed
that
the
name
preferably
the
secret
name
of
a
god
possessed
sufficient
force
in
its
mere
syllables
to
defeat
and
scatter
the
hordes
of
evil
things
that
surrounded
and
harassed
mankind
the
names
of
ea
and
merodach
were
perhaps
most
frequently
used
to
carry
destruction
into
the
ranks
of
the
demon
army
it
was
also
necessary
to
know
the
name
of
the
devil
or
person
against
whom
his
spells
were
directed
if
to
this
could
be
added
a
piece
of
hair
or
the
in
the
case
of
a
human
being
then
special
efficacy
was
given
to
the
enchantment
but
just
as
hair
or
nails
were
part
of
a
man
so
was
his
name
and
hence
the
great
virtue
ascribed
to
names
in
ancient
and
modern
the
name
was
as
it
were
the
vehicle
by
means
of
which
the
magician
established
a
link
between
himself
and
his
victim
and
the
babylonians
in
exorcising
sickness
or
disease
of
any
kind
were
wont
to
recite
long
catalogues
of
the
names
of
evil
spirits
and
demons
in
the
hope
that
by
so
doing
they
might
chance
to
light
upon
that
especial
individual
who
was
the
cause
of
the
malady
even
long
lists
of
names
of
persons
who
had
died
premature
deaths
were
often
recited
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
would
not
return
to
torment
the
living
babylonian
vampires
in
all
lands
and
epochs
the
grisly
conception
of
the
vampire
has
gained
a
strong
hold
upon
the
imagination
of
the
common
people
and
this
was
no
less
the
case
in
babylonia
and
assyria
than
elsewhere
there
have
not
been
wanting
those
who
believed
that
vampirism
was
confined
to
the
slavonic
race
alone
and
that
the
peoples
of
russia
bohemia
and
the
balkan
peninsula
were
the
sole
possessors
of
the
vampire
legend
recent
research
however
has
exposed
the
fallacy
of
this
theory
and
has
shown
that
far
from
being
the
property
of
the
slavs
or
even
of
aryan
peoples
this
horrible
belief
is
or
was
the
possession
of
practically
every
race
savage
or
civilized
that
is
known
to
anthropology
the
seven

of
assyria

other

this

line
clearly
indicates
their
character
as
vampires
they
are
akin
to
the
rakshasas
of
india
or
the
of
zoroastrianism
such
demons
are
also
to
be
seen
in

but
this
theory
will
scarcely
recommend
itself
to
anyone
with
even
a
slight
knowledge
of
mythological
science
the
abbé
calmet
difficulty
in
believing
in
vampires
was
that
he
could
not
understand
how
a
spirit
could
leave
its
grave
and
return
thence
with
ponderable
matter
in
the
form
of
blood
leaving
no
traces
showing
that
the
surface
of
the
earth
above
the
grave
had
been
stirred
but
this
view
might
be
solved
by
the
occult
theory
of
the
of
matter
the
bible
and
magic
the
earliest
biblical
account
of
anything
supposed
to
be
connected
with
magic
is
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
rachel
when
with
her
sister
leah
and
her
husband
jacob
she
had
left
the
house
of
her
father
rachel
had
stolen
the
images
that
were
her
father
then
laban
overtook
jacob
and
laban
said
yet
wherefore
hast
thou
stolen
my
gods
and
jacob
answered
and
said
with
whomsoever
thou
findest
thy
gods
let
him
not
live
before
our
brethren
discern
thou
what
is
thine
with
me
and
take
it
to
thee
for
jacob
knew
not
that
rachel
had
stolen
them
and
laban
went
into
jacob
tent
and
into
leah
tent
and
into
the
two
tent
but
he
found
them
not
then
went
he
out
of
leah
tent
and
entered
into
rachel
tent
now
rachel
had
taken
the
images
and
put
them
in
the
camel
furniture
and
sat
upon
them
and
laban
searched
all
the
tent
but
found
them
not
and
she
said
to
her
father
let
it
not
displease
my
lord
that
i
can
not
rise
up
before
thee
and
he
searched
but
found
not
the
images
this
passage
has
given
no
little
trouble
to
commentators
but
most
of
them
seem
to
consider
these
teraphim
or
images
as
something
of
a
magical
nature
the
speaking
head
the
targum
of
jonathan
ben
uzziel
gives
the
following
version
and
rachel
stole
the
images
of
her
father
for
they
had
murdered
a
man
who
was
a
son
and
having
cut
off
his
head
they
embalmed
it
with
salt
and
spices
and
they
wrote
divinations
upon
a
plate
of
gold
and
put
it
under
his
tongue
and
placed
it
against
the
wall
and
it
conversed
with
them
and
laban
worshipped
it
and
jacob
stole
the
science
of
laban
the
syrian
that
he
might
not
discover
his
departure
the
persian
translation
gives
us
astrolabes
instead
of
teraphim
and
implies
that
they
were
instruments
used
for
judicial
astrology
and
that
rachel
stole
them
to
prevent
her
father
from
discovering
their
route
at
all
events
the
teraphim
were
means
of
divination
among
believers
and
unbelievers
they
were
known
among
the
egyptians
and
among
syrians
what
makes
it
extremely
probable
that
they
were
not
objects
of
religious
worship
is
that
it
does
not
appear
from
any
other
passage
of
scripture
that
laban
was
an
idolater
besides
which
rachel
who
was
certainly
a
worshipper
of
the
true
god
took
them
it
seems
on
account
of
their
supposed
supernatural
powers
it
must
however
be
observed
that
some
have
supposed
these
teraphim
to
have
been
talismans
for
the
cure
of
diseases
and
others
that
being
really
idols
rachel
stole
them
to
put
a
stop
to
her
father
idolatry
there
is
a
not
very
dissimilar
account
related
judges
xviii
of
micah
and
his
teraphim
which
seems
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
use
of
them
was
not
considered
inconsistent
with
the
profession
of
the
true
religion
gods
once
demons
many
of
the
babylonian
gods
retained
traces
of
their
primitive
demoniacal
characteristics
and
this
applies
to
the
great
triad
ea
anu
and
who
probably
evolved
into
godhead
from
an
animistic
group
of
nature
spirits
each
of
these
gods
was
accompanied
by
demon
groups
thus
the
were
beloved
sons
of
bel
the
fates
were
the
seven
daughters
of
anu
and
the
seven
the
children
of
ea
in
a
magical
incantation
describing
the
primitive
monster
form
of
ea
it
is
said
that
his
head
is
like
a
serpent
the
ears
are
those
of
a
basilisk
his
horns
are
twisted
into
curls
his
body
is
a
full
of
stars
his
feet
are
armed
with
claws
and
the
sole
of
his
foot
has
no
heel
ea
was
great
magician
of
the
gods
his
sway
over
the
forces
of
nature
was
secured
by
the
performance
of
magical
rites
and
his
services
were
obtained
by
human
beings
who
performed
requisite
ceremonies
and
repeated
appropriate
spells
although
he
might
be
worshipped
and
propitiated
in
his
temple
at
eridu
he
could
also
be
conjured
in
mud
huts
the
latter
indeed
as
in
mexico
appear
to
have
been
the
oldest
holy
places
the
legend
of
ura
it
is
told
that
ura
the
dread
demon
of
disease
once
made
up
his
mind
to
destroy
mankind
but
ishnu
his
counsellor
appeased
him
so
that
he
abandoned
his
intention
and
he
gave
humanity
a
chance
of
escape
whoever
should
praise
ura
and
magnify
his
name
would
he
said
rule
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
and
should
have
none
to
oppose
him
he
should
not
die
in
pestilence
and
his
speech
should
bring
him
into
favour
with
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
wherever
a
tablet
with
the
song
of
ura
was
set
up
in
that
house
there
should
be
immunity
from
the
pestilence
as
we
read
in
the
closing
lines
of
the
gilgamesh
epic
the
dead
were
often
left
unburied
in
babylonia
and
the
ghosts
of
those
who
were
thus
treated
were
as
in
more
modern
times
and
climes
supposed
to
haunt
the
living
until
given
proper
sepulture
they
roamed
the
streets
and
byways
seeking
for
sustenance
among
the
garbage
in
the
gutters
and
looking
for
haunted
houses
in
which
to
dwell
denied
as
they
were
the
shelter
of
the
grave
which
was
regarded
as
the
true
of
the
dead
they
frequently
terrified
children
into
madness
or
death
and
bitterly
mocked
those
in
tribulation
they
were
in
fact
the
outcasts
of
mortality
spiteful
and
venomous
because
they
had
not
been
properly
treated
the
modern
race
which
most
nearly
approximates
to
the
babylonian
in
its
treatment
of
and
attitude
to
the
dead
seems
to
be
the
burmese
who
are
extremely
circumspect
as
to
how
they
speak
and
act
towards
the
inhabitants
of
the

they

that

bring
down

infinite
number

included
in

these

in

mixture
the
body
of
the
patient
is
to
be
anointed
the
chamber
of
the
let
us
attempt
to
describe
the
treatment
of
a
case
by
a
of
babylonia
the
proceeding
is
rather
a
recondite
one
but
by
the
aid
of
imagination
as
well
as
the
assistance
of
babylonian
representation
we
may
construct
a
tolerably
clear
picture
the
chamber
of
the
sage
is
almost
certain
to
be
situated
in
some
nook
in
one
of
those
vast
and
imposing
fanes
which
more
closely
resembled
cities
than
mere
temples
we
draw
the
curtain
and
enter
a
rather
darksome
room
the
atmosphere
is
pungent
with
chemic
odours
and
ranged
on
shelves
disposed
upon
the
tiled
walls
are
numerous
jars
great
and
small
containing
the
fearsome
compounds
which
the
practitioner
applies
to
the
sufferings
of
babylonian
humanity
the
asipu
shaven
and
austere
asks
us
what
we
desire
of
him
and
in
the
rôle
of
babylonian
citizens
we
acquaint
him
with
the
fact
that
our
lives
are
made
miserable
for
us
by
a
witch
who
sends
upon
us
misfortune
after
misfortune
now
the
blight
or
some
equally
intractable
and
horrible
disease
now
an
evil
wind
now
unspeakable
enchantments
which
torment
us
unceasingly
in
his
capacity
of
physician
the
asipu
examines
our
bodies
shrunken
and
exhausted
with
fever
or
rheumatism
and
having
prescribed
for
us
compounds
the
mixture
with
his
own
hands
and
enjoins
us
to
its
regular
application
he
mixes
various
ingredients
in
a
stone
mortar
whispering
his
spells
the
while
with
many
a
prayer
to
ea
the
beneficent
and
merodach
the
that
we
may
be
restored
to
health
then
he
promises
to
visit
us
at
our
dwelling
and
gravely
bids
us
adieu
after
expressing
the
hope
that
we
will
graciously
contribute
to
the
upkeep
of
the
house
of
religion
to
which
he
is
attached
leaving
the
darkened
haunt
of
the
asipu
for
the
brilliant
sunshine
of
a
babylonian
summer
afternoon
we
are
at
first
inclined
to
forget
our
fears
and
to
laugh
away
the
horrible
superstitions
the
relics
of
barbarian
ancestors
which
weigh
us
down
but
as
night
approaches
we
grow
more
fearful
we
crouch
with
the
children
in
the
darkest
corner
of
our
dwelling
and
tremble
at
every
sound
the
rushing
of
the
wind
overhead
is
for
us
the
noise
of
the
labartu
the
come
hither
to
tear
from
us
our
little
ones
or
perhaps
a
rat
rustling
in
the
straw
may
seem
to
us
the
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
gibber
at
the
threshold
and
even
pale
uru
lord
of
disease
himself
may
glance
in
at
the
tiny
window
with
ghastly
countenance
and
eager
red
eyes
the
pains
of
rheumatism
assail
us
ha
the
evil
witch
is
at
work
thrusting
thorns
into
the
waxen
images
made
in
our
shape
that
we
may
suffer
the
torment
brought
about
by
sympathetic
magic
to
which
we
would
rather
refer
our
aches
than
to
the
circumstance
that
we
dwell
hard
by
the
a
loud
knocking
resounds
at
the
door
we
tremble
anew
and
the
children
scream
at
last
the
dread
powers
of
evil
have
come
to
summon
us
to
the
final
ordeal
or
perhaps
the
witch
herself
grown
bold
by
reason
of
her
immunity
has
come
to
wreak
fresh
vengeance
the
flimsy
door
of
boards
is
thrown
open
and
to
our
unspeakable
relief
the
stern
face
of
the
asipu
appears
beneath
the
flickering
light
of
the
taper
we
shout
with
joy
and
the
children
cluster
around
the
priest
clinging
to
his
garments
and
clasping
his
knees
the
the
priest
smiles
at
our
fear
and
motioning
us
to
sit
in
a
circle
produces
several
waxen
figures
of
demons
which
he
places
on
the
floor
it
is
noticeable
that
these
figures
all
appear
to
be
bound
with
miniature
ropes
taking
one
of
these
in
the
shape
of
a
labartu
or
the
priest
places
before
it
twelve
small
cakes
made
from
a
peculiar
kind
of
meal
he
then
pours
out
a
libation
of
water
places
the
image
of
a
small
black
dog
beside
that
of
the
witch
lays
a
piece
of
the
heart
of
a
young
pig
on
the
mouth
of
the
figure
and
some
white
bread
and
a
box
of
ointment
beside
it
he
then
chants
something
like
the
following
may
a
guardian
spirit
be
present
at
my
side
when
i
draw
near
unto
the
sick
man
when
i
examine
his
muscles
when
i
compose
his
limbs
when
i
sprinkle
the
water
of
ea
upon
him
avoid
thee
whether
thou
art
an
evil
spirit
or
an
evil
demon
an
evil
ghost
or
an
evil
devil
an
evil
god
or
an
evil
fiend
ghoul
sprite
phantom
or
wraith
or
any
disease
fever
headache
shivering
or
any
sorcery
spell
or
enchantment
having
recited
some
such
words
of
power
the
asipu
then
directs
us
to
keep
the
figure
at
the
head
of
our
bed
for
three
nights
then
to
bury
it
beneath
the
earthen
floor
but
alas
no
cure
results
the
witch
still
torments
us
by
day
and
night
and
once
more
we
have
recourse
to
the
the
ceremony
is
gone
through
again
but
still
the
family
health
does
not
improve
the
little
ones
suffer
from
fever
and
bad
luck
consistently
dogs
us
after
a
stormy
scene
between
husband
and
wife
who
differ
regarding
the
qualifications
of
the
asipu
another
practitioner
is
called
in
he
is
younger
and
more
enterprising
than
the
last
and
he
has
not
yet
learned
that
half
the
business
of
the
physician
is
to
his
patients
in
the
financial
sense
of
the
term
whereas
the
elderly
asipu
had
gone
quietly
home
to
bed
after
prescribing
for
us
this
young
physician
who
has
his
spurs
to
win
after
being
consulted
goes
home
to
his
clay
surgery
and
hunts
up
a
likely
exorcism
next
day
armed
with
this
wordy
weapon
he
arrives
at
our
dwelling
and
placing
a
waxen
image
of
the
witch
upon
the
floor
vents
upon
it
the
full
force
of
his
rhetoric
as
he
is
on
the
point
of
leaving
screams
resound
from
a
neighbouring
cabin
bestowing
upon
us
a
look
of
the
deepest
meaning
our
asipu
darts
to
the
hut
opposite
and
hales
forth
an
ancient
crone
whose
appearance
of
age
and
illness
give
her
a
most
sinister
look
at
once
we
recognize
in
her
a
wretch
who
dared
to
menace
our
children
when
in
innocent
play
they
cast
hot
ashes
upon
her
thatch
and
introduced
hot
swamp
water
into
her
cistern
in
righteous
wrath
we
lay
hands
on
the
abandoned
being
who
for
so
many
months
has
cast
a
blight
upon
our
lives
she
exclaims
that
the
pains
of
death
have
seized
upon
her
and
we
laugh
in
triumph
for
we
know
that
the
superior
magic
of
our
asipu
has
taken
effect
on
the
way
to
the
river
we
are
joined
by
neighbours
who
rejoice
with
us
that
we
have
caught
the
witch
great
is
the
satisfaction
of
the
party
when
at
last
the
devilish
crone
is
cast
headlong
into
the
stream
but
ere
many
seconds
pass
we
begin
to
look
incredulously
upon
each
other
for
the
wicked
one
refuses
to
sink
this
means
that
she
is
innocent
then
awful
moment
we
find
every
eye
directed
upon
us
we
who
were
so
happy
and
but
a
moment
before
we
tremble
for
we
know
how
severe
are
the
laws
against
the
indiscriminate
accusation
of
those
suspected
of
witchcraft
as
the
ancient
crone
continues
to
float
a
loud
murmuring
arises
in
the
crowd
and
with
quaking
limbs
and
eyes
full
of
terror
we
snatch
up
our
children
and
make
a
dash
for
freedom
luckily
the
asipu
accompanies
us
so
that
the
crowd
dare
not
pursue
and
indeed
so
absurdly
changeable
is
human
nature
most
of
them
are
busied
in
rescuing
the
old
woman
in
a
few
minutes
we
have
placed
all
immediate
danger
of
pursuit
behind
us
the
asipu
has
departed
to
his
temple
richer
in
the
experience
by
the
lesson
of
a
false
after
a
hurried
consultation
we
quit
the
town
skirt
the
arable
land
which
fringes
it
and
plunge
into
the
desert
she
who
was
opposed
to
the
employment
of
a
young
and
inexperienced
asipu
does
not
make
matters
any
better
by
reiterating
i
told
you
so
and
he
who
favoured
a
opinion
on
paying
a
night
visit
to
the
city
discovers
that
the
has
succumbed
to
her
harsh
treatment
that
his
house
has
been
made
over
to
her
relatives
by
way
of
compensation
and
that
a
legal
process
has
been
taken
out
against
him
returning
to
his
wife
he
acquaints
her
with
the
sad
news
and
hand
in
hand
with
their
weeping
offspring
they
turn
and
face
the
desert
the
magic
circle
the
magic
circle
as
in
use
among
the
chaldean
sorcerers
bears
many
points
of
resemblance
to
that
described
in
mediæval
works
on
magic
the
babylonian
magician
when
describing
the
circle
made
seven
little
winged
figures
which
he
set
before
an
image
of
the
god
nergal
after
doing
so
he
stated
that
he
had
covered
them
with
a
dark
robe
and
bound
them
with
a
coloured
cord
setting
beside
them
tamarisk
and
the
heart
of
the
palm
that
he
had
completed
the
magic
circle
and
had
surrounded
them
with
a
sprinkling
of
lime
and
flour
that
the
magic
circle
of
mediæval
times
must
have
been
evolved
from
the
chaldean
is
plain
from
the
strong
resemblance
between
the
two
directions
for
the
making
of
a
mediæval
magic
circle
are
as
follows
in
the
first
place
the
magician
is
supposed
to
fix
upon
a
spot
proper
for
such
a
purpose
which
must
be
either
in
a
subterranean
vault
hung
round
with
black
and
lighted
by
a
magical
torch
or
else
in
the
centre
of
some
thick
wood
or
desert
or
upon
some
extensive
unfrequented
plain
where
several
roads
meet
or
amidst
the
ruins
of
ancient
castles
abbeys
or
monasteries
or
amongst
the
rocks
on
the
seashore
in
some
private
detached
churchyard
or
any
other
melancholy
place
between
the
hours
of
twelve
and
one
in
the
night
either
when
the
moon
shines
very
bright
or
else
when
the
elements
are
disturbed
with
storms
of
thunder
lightning
wind
and
rain
for
in
these
places
times
and
seasons
it
is
contended
that
spirits
can
with
less
difficulty
manifest
themselves
to
mortal
eyes
and
continue
visible
with
the
least
pain
when
the
proper
time
and
place
are
fixed
upon
a
magic
circle
is
to
be
formed
within
which
the
master
and
his
associates
are
carefully
to
retire
the
reason
assigned
by
magicians
and
others
for
the
institution
and
use
of
the
circles
is
that
so
much
ground
being
blessed
and
consecrated
by
holy
words
and
ceremonies
has
a
secret
force
to
expel
all
evil
spirits
from
the
bounds
thereof
and
being
sprinkled
with
sacred
water
the
ground
is
purified
from
all
uncleanness
beside
the
holy
names
of
god
being
written
over
every
part
of
it
its
force
becomes
proof
against
all
evil
spirits
babylonian
demons
babylonian
demons
were
legion
and
most
of
them
exceedingly
malevolent
the
utukku
was
an
evil
spirit
that
lurked
generally
in
the
desert
where
it
lay
in
wait
for
unsuspecting
travellers
but
it
did
not
confine
its
haunts
to
the
more
barren
places
for
it
was
also
to
be
found
among
the
mountains
in
graveyards
and
even
in
the
sea
an
evil
fate
befel
the
man
upon
whom
it
looked
the
rabisu
is
another
lurking
demon
that
secretes
itself
in
unfrequented
spots
to
leap
upon
the
labartu
which
has
already
been
alluded
to
is
strangely
enough
spoken
of
as
the
daughter
of
anu
she
was
supposed
to
dwell
in
the
mountains
or
in
marshy
places
and
was
particularly
addicted
to
the
destruction
of
children
babylonian
mothers
were
wont
to
hang
charms
round
their
children
necks
to
guard
them
against
this
horrible
hag
the
sedu
appears
to
have
been
in
some
senses
a
guardian
spirit
and
in
others
a
being
of
evil
propensities
it
is
often
appealed
to
at
the
end
of
invocations
along
with
the
lamassu
a
spirit
of
a
similar
type
these
malign
influences
were
probably
the
prototypes
of
the
arabian
jinn
to
whom
they
have
many
points
of
resemblance
many
assyrian
spirits
were
and
and
some
of
them
were
supposed
to
contract
unions
with
human
beings
like
the
arabian
jinn
the
offspring
of
such
unions
was
supposed
to
be
a
spirit
called
alu
which
haunted
ruins
and
deserted
buildings
and
indeed
entered
the
houses
of
men
like
a
ghost
to
steal
their
sleep
ghosts
proper
were
also
common
enough
as
has
already
been
observed
and
those
who
had
not
been
buried
were
almost
certain
to
return
to
harass
mankind
it
was
dangerous
even
to
look
upon
a
corpse
lest
the
spirit
or
edimmu
of
the
dead
man
should
seize
upon
the
beholder
the
assyrians
seemed
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
a
ghost
like
a
vampire
might
drain
away
the
strength
of
the
living
and
long
formulæ
were
in
existence
containing
numerous
names
of
haunting
spirits
one
of
which
it
was
hoped
would
apply
to
the
tormenting
ghost
and
these
were
used
for
the
purposes
of
exorcism
to
lay
a
spirit
the
following
articles
were
necessary
seven
small
loaves
of
roast
corn
the
hoof
of
a
ox
flour
of
roast
corn
and
a
little
leaven
the
ghosts
were
then
asked
why
they
tormented
the
haunted
man
after
which
the
flour
and
leaven
were
kneaded
into
a
paste
in
the
horn
of
an
ox
and
a
small
libation
poured
into
a
hole
in
the
earth
the
leaven
dough
was
then
placed
in
the
hoof
of
an
ox
and
another
libation
poured
out
with
an
incantation
to
the
god
shamash
in
another
case
figures
of
the
dead
man
and
the
living
person
to
whom
the
spirit
has
appeared
are
to
be
made
and
libations
poured
out
before
both
of
them
then
the
figure
of
the
dead
man
is
to
be
buried
and
that
of
the
living
man
washed
in
pure
water
the
whole
ceremony
being
typical
of
sympathetic
magic
which
thus
supposed
the
burial
of
the
body
of
the
ghost
and
the
purification
of
the
living
man
in
the
morning
incense
was
to
be
offered
up
before
the
at
his
rising
when
sweet
woods
were
to
be
burned
and
a
libation
of
sesame
wine
poured
out
if
a
human
being
was
troubled
by
a
ghost
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
anointed
with
various
substances
in
order
that
the
result
of
the
ghostly
contact
might
be
nullified
an
old
text
says
when
a
ghost
appeareth
in
the
house
of
a
man
there
will
be
a
destruction
of
that
house
when
it
speaketh
and
hearkeneth
for
an
answer
the
man
will
die
and
there
will
be
lamentation
taboo
the
belief
in
taboo
was
universal
in
ancient
chaldea
amongst
the
babylonians
it
was
known
as
there
were
taboos
on
many
things
but
especially
upon
corpses
and
uncleanness
of
all
kinds
we
find
the
taboo
generally
alluded
to
in
a
text
as
the
barrier
that
none
can
pass
among
all
barbarous
peoples
the
taboo
is
usually
intended
to
hedge
in
the
sacred
thing
from
the
profane
person
or
the
common
people
but
it
may
also
be
employed
for
sanitary
reasons
thus
the
flesh
of
certain
animals
such
as
the
pig
may
not
be
eaten
in
hot
countries
food
must
not
be
prepared
by
those
who
are
in
the
slightest
degree
suspected
of
uncleanness
and
these
laws
are
usually
of
the
most
rigorous
character
but
should
a
man
violate
the
taboo
placed
upon
certain
foods
then
he
himself
often
became
taboo
no
one
might
have
any
intercourse
with
him
he
was
left
to
his
own
devices
and
in
short
became
a
sort
of
pariah
in
the
assyrian
texts
we
find
many
instances
of
this
kind
of
taboo
and
numerous
were
the
supplications
that
these
might
be
removed
if
one
drank
water
from
an
unclean
cup
he
had
violated
a
taboo
like
the
arab
he
might
not
lick
the
platter
clean
if
he
were
taboo
he
might
not
touch
another
man
he
might
not
converse
with
him
he
might
not
pray
to
the
gods
he
might
not
even
be
interceded
for
by
anyone
else
in
fact
he
was
excommunicate
if
a
man
cast
his
eye
upon
water
which
another
person
had
washed
his
hands
in
or
if
he
came
into
contact
with
a
person
who
had
not
yet
performed
his
ablutions
he
became
unclean
an
entire
purification
ritual
was
incumbent
on
any
assyrian
who
touched
or
even
looked
upon
a
dead
man
it
may
be
asked
wherefore
was
this
elaborate
cleanliness
essential
to
avoid
taboo
the
answer
undoubtedly
is
because
of
the
belief
in
the
power
of
sympathetic
magic
did
one
come
into
contact
with
a
person
who
was
in
any
way
unclean
or
with
a
corpse
or
other
unpleasant
object
he
was
supposed
to
come
within
the
radius
of
the
evil
which
emanated
from
it
popular
superstitions
the
superstition
that
the
of
a
witch
or
a
wizard
might
bring
blight
upon
an
individual
or
community
was
as
persistent
in
chaldea
as
elsewhere
incantations
frequently
allude
to
it
as
among
the
causes
of
sickness
and
exorcisms
were
duly
directed
against
it
even
on
the
site
of
the
ruins
of
babylon
children
are
protected
against
it
by
fastening
small
blue
objects
to
their
just
as
mould
from
a
grave
was
supposed
by
the
witches
of
the
middle
ages
to
be
particularly
efficacious
in
magic
so
was
the
dust
of
the
temple
supposed
to
possess
hidden
virtue
in
assyria
if
one
pared
nails
or
cut
one
hair
it
was
considered
necessary
to
bury
them
lest
a
sorcerer
should
discover
them
and
use
them
against
their
late
owner
for
a
sorcery
performed
upon
a
part
was
by
the
law
of
sympathetic
magic
thought
to
reflect
upon
the
whole
a
like
superstition
attached
to
the
discarded
clothing
of
people
for
among
barbarian
or
uncultured
folk
the
apparel
is
regarded
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
man
even
in
our
own
time
simple
and
uneducated
people
tear
a
piece
from
their
garments
and
hang
it
as
an
offering
on
the
bushes
around
any
of
the
numerous
healing
wells
in
the
country
that
they
may
have
journeyed
to
this
is
a
survival
of
the
custom
of
sacrificing
the
part
for
the
whole
if
one
desired
to
get
rid
of
a
headache
one
had
to
take
the
hair
of
a
young
kid
and
give
it
to
a
wise
woman
who
would
spin
it
on
the
right
side
and
double
it
on
the
left
then
it
was
to
be
bound
into
fourteen
knots
and
the
incantation
of
ea
pronounced
upon
it
after
which
it
was
to
be
bound
round
the
head
and
neck
of
the
sick
man
for
defects
in
eyesight
the
assyrians
wove
black
and
white
threads
or
hairs
together
muttering
incantations
the
while
and
these
were
placed
upon
the
eyes
it
was
thought
too
that
the
tongues
of
evil
spirits
or
sorcerers
could
be
and
that
a
net
because
of
its
many
knots
was
efficacious
in
keeping
magicians
away
omens
divination
as
practised
by
means
of
augury
was
a
rite
of
the
first
importance
among
the
babylonians
and
assyrians
this
was
absolutely
distinct
from
divination
by
astrology
the
favourite
method
of
augury
among
the
chaldeans
of
old
was
that
by
examination
of
the
liver
of
a
slaughtered
animal
it
was
thought
that
when
an
animal
was
offered
up
in
sacrifice
to
a
god
that
the
deity
identified
himself
for
the
time
being
with
that
animal
and
that
the
beast
thus
afforded
a
means
of
indicating
the
wishes
of
the
god
now
among
people
in
a
primitive
state
of
culture
the
soul
is
almost
invariably
supposed
to
reside
in
the
liver
instead
of
in
the
heart
or
brain
more
blood
is
secreted
by
the
liver
than
by
any
other
organ
in
the
body
and
upon
the
opening
of
a
carcase
it
appears
the
most
striking
the
most
central
and
the
most
sanguinary
of
the
vital
parts
the
liver
was
in
fact
supposed
by
early
peoples
to
be
the
fountain
of
the
blood
supply
and
therefore
of
life
itself
hepatoscopy
or
divination
from
the
liver
was
undertaken
by
the
chaldeans
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
gods
had
in
mind
the
soul
of
the
animal
became
for
the
nonce
the
soul
of
the
god
therefore
if
the
signs
of
the
liver
of
the
sacrificed
animal
could
be
read
the
mind
of
the
god
became
clear
and
his
intentions
regarding
the
future
were
known
the
animal
usually
sacrificed
was
a
sheep
the
liver
of
which
animal
is
most
complicated
in
appearance
the
two
lower
lobes
are
sharply
divided
from
one
another
and
are
separated
from
the
upper
by
a
narrow
depression
and
the
whole
surface
is
covered
with
markings
and
fissures
lines
and
curves
which
give
it
much
the
appearance
of
a
map
on
which
roads
and
valleys
are
outlined
this
applies
to
the
freshly
excised
liver
only
and
these
markings
are
never
the
same
in
any
two
livers
certain
priests
were
set
apart
for
the
practice
of
and
these
were
exceedingly
expert
being
able
to
decipher
the
hepatoscopic
signs
with
great
skill
they
first
examined
the
which
might
be
reduced
or
swollen
they
inferred
various
circumstances
from
the
several
ducts
and
the
shapes
and
sizes
of
the
lobes
and
their
appendices
diseases
of
the
liver
too
particularly
common
among
sheep
in
all
countries
were
even
more
frequent
among
these
animals
in
the
marshy
portions
of
the
euphrates
valley
illustration
clay
object
resembling
a
sheep
liver
this
is
inscribed
with
magical
formulæ
it
was
probably
used
for
purposes
of
divination
and
was
employed
by
the
priests
of
babylon
in
their
photo
mansell
and
the
literature
connected
with
this
species
of
augury
is
very
extensive
and
library
contained
thousands
of
fragments
describing
the
omens
deduced
from
the
practice
these
enumerate
the
chief
appearances
of
the
liver
as
the
shade
of
the
colour
of
the
gall
the
length
of
the
ducts
and
so
forth
the
lobes
were
divided
into
sections
lower
medial
and
higher
and
the
interpretation
varied
from
the
phenomena
therein
observed
the
markings
on
the
liver
possessed
various
names
such
as
and
which
terms
remind
us
somewhat
of
the
bizarre
nomenclature
of
astrology
later
in
the
progress
of
the
art
the
various
combinations
of
signs
came
to
be
known
so
well
and
there
were
so
many
cuneiform
texts
in
existence
which
afforded
instruction
in
them
that
a
liver
could
be
quickly
by
the
or
reader
a
name
which
was
afterward
applied
to
the
astrologists
as
well
and
to
those
who
divined
through
various
other
natural
phenomena
one
of
the
earliest
instances
on
record
of
hepatoscopy
is
that
regarding
who
consulted
a
sheep
liver
before
declaring
war
the
great
sargon
did
likewise
and
we
find
gudea
applying
to
his
inspectors
when
attempting
to
discover
a
favourable
time
for
laying
the
foundations
of
the
temple
of
throughout
the
whole
history
of
the
babylonian
monarchy
in
fact
from
its
early
beginnings
to
its
end
we
find
this
system
in
vogue
whether
it
was
in
force
in
sumerian
times
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
there
is
every
likelihood
that
such
was
the
case
the
ritual
of
hepatoscopy
quite
an
elaborate
ritual
grew
up
around
the
readings
of
the
omens
by
the
examination
of
the
liver
the
barû
who
officiated
must
first
of
all
purify
himself
and
don
special
apparel
for
the
ceremony
prayers
were
then
offered
up
to
shamash
and
hadad
or
rammon
who
were
known
as
the
of
divination
specific
questions
were
usually
put
the
sheep
selected
for
sacrifice
must
be
without
blemish
and
the
manner
of
slaughtering
it
and
the
examination
of
its
liver
must
be
made
with
the
most
meticulous
care
sometimes
the
signs
were
doubtful
and
upon
such
occasions
a
second
sheep
was
sacrificed
nabonidus
the
last
king
of
babylon
on
one
occasion
desired
to
restore
a
temple
to
the
at
harran
he
wished
to
be
certain
that
this
step
commended
itself
to
merodach
the
chief
deity
of
babylonia
so
he
applied
to
the
inspectors
of
his
day
and
found
that
the
omen
was
favourable
we
find
him
also
desirous
of
making
a
certain
symbol
of
the
in
accordance
with
an
ancient
pattern
he
placed
a
model
of
this
before
shamash
and
consulted
the
liver
of
a
sheep
to
ascertain
whether
the
god
approved
of
the
offering
but
on
three
separate
occasions
the
signs
were
unfavourable
nabonidus
then
concluded
that
the
model
of
the
symbol
could
not
have
been
correctly
reproduced
and
on
replacing
it
by
another
he
found
the
signs
propitious
in
order
however
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
he
sought
among
the
records
of
the
past
for
the
result
of
a
liver
inspection
on
a
similar
occasion
and
by
comparing
the
omens
he
became
convinced
that
he
was
safe
in
making
a
symbol
peculiar
signs
when
they
were
found
connected
with
events
of
importance
were
specially
noted
in
the
literature
of
liver
divination
and
were
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
of
diviners
thus
a
number
of
omens
are
associated
with
gilgamesh
the
mythical
hero
of
the
babylonian
epic
and
a
certain
condition
of
the
is
said
to
indicate
the
omen
of
urumush
the
king
whom
the
men
of
his
palace
killed
bad
signs
and
good
signs
are
enumerated
in
the
literature
of
the
subject
thus
like
most
peoples
the
babylonians
considered
the
right
side
as
lucky
and
the
left
as
unlucky
any
sign
on
the
right
side
of
the
ducts
or
lobes
was
supposed
to
refer
to
the
king
the
country
or
the
army
while
a
similar
sign
on
the
sinister
side
applied
to
the
enemy
thus
a
good
sign
on
the
right
side
applied
to
babylonia
or
assyria
in
a
favourable
sense
a
bad
sign
on
the
right
side
in
an
unfavourable
sense
a
good
sign
on
the
left
side
was
an
omen
favourable
to
the
enemy
whereas
a
bad
sign
on
the
left
side
was
of
course
to
the
native
king
or
forces
it
would
be
out
of
place
here
to
give
a
more
extended
description
of
the
of
the
ancient
chaldeans
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
subject
is
a
very
complicated
one
in
its
deeper
significance
and
has
little
interest
for
the
general
reader
in
its
advanced
stages
certain
conditions
of
the
liver
could
only
indicate
certain
political
religious
or
personal
events
it
will
be
more
interesting
if
we
attempt
to
visualise
the
act
of
divination
by
liver
reading
as
it
was
practised
in
ancient
babylonia
and
if
our
imaginations
break
down
in
the
process
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
very
large
material
they
have
to
work
upon
the
missing
caravan
the
ages
roll
back
as
a
scroll
and
i
see
myself
as
one
of
the
great
of
babylon
one
of
those
princes
of
commerce
whose
contracts
and
agreements
are
found
stamped
upon
clay
cylinders
where
once
the
stately
palaces
of
barter
arose
from
the
swarming
streets
of
the
city
of
merodach
i
have
that
morning
been
carried
in
my
litter
by
sweating
slaves
from
my
white
house
in
a
leafy
suburb
lying
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
lofty
of
borsippa
as
i
reach
my
place
of
business
i
am
aware
of
unrest
for
the
financial
operations
in
which
i
engage
are
so
closely
watched
that
i
may
say
without
that
i
represent
the
pulse
of
babylonian
commerce
i
enter
the
cool
chamber
where
i
usually
transact
my
business
and
where
a
pair
of
officious
persian
slaves
commence
to
fan
me
as
soon
as
i
take
my
seat
my
head
clerk
enters
and
makes
obeisance
with
an
expression
on
his
face
eloquent
of
important
news
it
is
as
i
expected
as
i
feared
the
caravan
from
the
persian
gulf
due
to
arrive
at
babylon
more
than
a
week
ago
has
not
yet
made
its
appearance
and
although
i
had
sent
scouting
parties
as
far
as
ninnur
these
have
returned
without
bringing
me
the
least
intelligence
regarding
it
i
feel
convinced
that
the
caravan
with
my
spices
woven
fabrics
rare
woods
and
precious
stones
will
never
come
tinkling
down
the
great
central
street
to
deposit
its
wealth
at
the
doors
of
my
warehouses
and
the
thought
renders
me
so
irritable
that
i
sharply
dismiss
the
persian
and
curse
again
and
again
the
sons
of
elam
who
have
doubtless
looted
my
goods
and
cut
the
throats
of
my
guards
and
servants
i
go
home
at
an
early
hour
full
of
my
misfortune
i
can
not
eat
my
evening
meal
my
wife
gently
asks
me
what
ails
me
but
with
a
growl
i
refuse
to
enlighten
her
upon
the
cause
of
my
annoyance
still
however
she
persists
and
succeeds
in
breaking
down
my
surly
opposition
why
trouble
thy
heart
concerning
this
thing
when
thou
mayest
know
what
has
happened
to
thy
goods
and
thy
servants
get
thee
to
the
baru
and
he
will
enlighten
thee
she
says
i
start
after
all
women
have
sense
there
can
be
no
harm
in
seeing
the
baru
and
asking
him
to
divine
what
has
happened
to
my
caravan
but
i
bethink
me
that
i
am
wealthy
and
that
the
priests
love
to
pluck
a
pigeon
i
mention
my
suspicions
of
the
priestly
caste
in
no
measured
terms
to
the
distress
of
my
devout
wife
and
the
amusement
of
my
restlessly
i
toss
upon
my
couch
and
after
a
sleepless
night
feel
that
i
can
not
resume
my
business
with
the
fear
of
loss
upon
me
so
without
breathing
a
word
of
my
intention
to
my
wife
i
direct
my
to
carry
me
to
the
great
temple
at
borsippa
arrived
there
i
enquire
for
the
chief
baru
he
is
one
of
the
friends
of
my
youth
but
for
years
our
paths
have
diverged
and
it
is
with
surprise
that
he
now
greets
me
i
acquaint
him
with
the
nature
of
my
dilemma
and
nodding
sympathetically
he
assures
me
that
he
will
do
his
utmost
to
assist
me
somewhat
reassured
i
follow
him
into
a
tiled
court
near
the
far
end
of
which
stands
a
large
altar
at
a
sign
from
him
two
priests
bring
in
a
live
sheep
and
cut
its
throat
they
then
open
the
carcase
and
extract
the
liver
immediately
the
chief
baru
bends
his
grey
head
over
it
for
a
long
time
he
stares
at
it
with
the
keenest
attention
i
begin
to
weary
and
my
old
doubts
regarding
the
sacerdotal
caste
return
at
last
the
grey
head
rises
from
the
long
inspection
and
the
baru
turns
to
me
with
smiling
face
the
omen
is
good
my
son
he
says
with
a
cheerful
intonation
the
compass
and
the
hepatic
duct
are
short
thy
path
will
be
protected
by
thy
guardian
spirit
as
will
the
path
of
thy
servants
go
and
fear
not
he
speaks
so
definitely
and
his
words
are
so
reassuring
that
i
seize
him
by
the
hands
and
thanking
him
effusively
take
my
leave
i
go
down
to
my
warehouses
in
a
new
spirit
of
hopefulness
and
disregard
the
disdainful
or
pitying
looks
cast
in
my
direction
i
sit
unperturbed
and
dictate
contracts
and
letters
of
credit
to
my
scribe
ha
what
is
that
by
merodach
it
is
it
is
the
sound
of
bells
up
i
leap
upsetting
the
wretched
scribe
who
squats
at
my
feet
and
trampling
upon
his
still
wet
clay
tablets
i
rush
to
the
door
down
the
street
slowly
advances
a
caravan
and
at
the
head
of
it
there
rides
my
trusty
captain
babbar
he
tumbles
out
of
the
saddle
and
kneels
before
me
but
i
raise
him
in
a
close
embrace
all
my
goods
he
assures
me
are
intact
and
the
cause
of
delay
was
a
severe
sickness
which
broke
out
among
his
followers
but
all
have
recovered
and
my
credit
is
restored
as
i
turn
to
my
warehouse
with
babbar
a
detaining
hand
is
placed
on
my
shoulder
it
is
a
messenger
from
the
chief
baru
my
brother
at
the
temple
saw
thy
caravan
coming
from
afar
he
says
politely
and
his
message
to
thee
my
son
is
that
since
thou
hast
so
happily
recovered
thine
own
thou
shouldst
devote
a
tithe
of
it
to
the
service
of
the
gods
myths

chapter
xi
the
mythological
monsters
and
animals
of
chaldea
tiawath
was
not
the
only
monster
known
to
babylonian
mythology
but
she
is
sometimes
likened
to
or
confounded
with
the
serpent
of
darkness
with
which
she
had
originally
no
connexion
whatever
this
being
was
however
like
tiawath
the
offspring
of
the
great
deep
and
the
enemy
of
the
divine
powers
we
are
told
in
the
second
verse
of
genesis
that
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
and
therefore
resembling
the
abyss
of
babylonian
myth
we
are
also
informed
that
the
serpent
was
esteemed
as
more
subtle
than
other
beast
of
the
field
and
this
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
professor
sayce
was
probably
because
it
was
associated
by
the
author
or
authors
of
genesis
with
ea
the
god
of
waters
and
of
wisdom
to
babylonian
geographers
as
to
the
greeks
the
ocean
was
a
coiling
thing
which
was
often
alluded
to
as
the
great
serpent
and
this
soon
came
to
be
considered
as
the
source
of
all
evil
and
misfortune
the
ancients
and
especially
the
ancient
semites
with
the
exception
of
the
phœnicians
appear
to
have
regarded
it
with
dread
and
loathing
the
serpent
appears
to
have
been
called
aibu
enemy
we
can
see
how
the
serpent
of
darkness
the
offspring
of
chaos
and
confusion
became
also
the
hebrew
symbol
for
mischief
he
was
first
the
source
of
physical
and
next
the
source
of
moral
evil
winged
bulls
the
winged
bulls
so
closely
identified
with
ancient
chaldean
mythology
were
probably
associated
with
merodach
these
may
have
represented
the
original
totemic
forms
of
the
gods
in
question
but
we
must
not
confound
the
bull
forms
of
merodach
and
ea
with
those
winged
bulls
which
guarded
the
entrances
to
the
temples
these
to
perpetrate
a
double
were
not
bulls
at
all
but
divine
beings
the
gods
or
genii
of
the
holy
places
the
human
head
attached
to
them
indicated
that
the
creature
was
endowed
with
humanity
and
the
body
symbolized
strength
when
the
babylonian
translated
the
word
from
the
akkadian
tongue
he
usually
rendered
it
or
one
it
is
thought
that
the
bull
forms
of
ea
and
merodach
must
have
originated
at
eridu
for
both
of
these
deities
were
connected
with
the
city
the
babylonians
regarded
the
as
a
double
of
the
plain
in
which
they
dwelt
and
they
believed
that
the
gods
as
planets
ploughed
their
way
across
the
azure
fields
of
air
thus
the
sun
was
the
of
light
and
jupiter
the
nearest
of
the
planets
to
the
ecliptic
was
known
as
the
of
the
bull
of
light
the
dog
in
babylonia
strangely
enough
the
dog
was
classed
by
the
babylonians
as
a
monster
animal
and
one
to
be
despised
and
avoided
in
a
prayer
against
the
powers
of
evil
we
read
from
the
dog
the
snake
the
scorpion
the
reptile
and
whatever
is
baleful
may
merodach
preserve
us
we
find
that
although
the
babylonians
possessed
an
excellent
breed
of
dog
they
were
not
fond
of
depicting
them
either
in
painting
or
dogs
are
seen
illustrated
in
a
of
and
five
clay
figures
of
dogs
now
in
the
british
museum
represent
hounds
which
belonged
to
that
monarch
the
names
of
these
animals
are
very
amusing
and
appear
to
indicate
that
those
who
bestowed
them
must
have
suffered
from
a
complete
lack
of
the
humorous
sense
or
else
have
been
blessed
with
an
overflow
of
it
translated
the
names
are
and
how
well
these
names
would
fit
certain
dogs
we
all
know
or
have
known
here
is
good
evidence
from
the
buried
centuries
that
dog
nature
like
human
nature
has
not
changed
a
whit
but
why
should
the
dog
with
early
man
and
the
companion
of
civilized
humanity
have
been
regarded
as
evil
professor
sayce
considers
that
the
four
dogs
of
merodach
were
not
always
sent
on
errands
of
mercy
and
that
originally
they
had
been
devastating
winds
a
dog
legend
the
fragment
of
a
legend
exists
which
does
not
exhibit
the
dog
in
any
very
favourable
light
once
there
was
a
shepherd
who
was
tormented
by
the
constant
assaults
of
dogs
upon
his
flocks
he
prayed
to
ea
for
protection
and
the
great
god
of
wisdom
sent
his
son
merodach
to
reassure
the
shepherd
ea
has
heard
thee
said
merodach
when
the
great
dogs
assault
thee
then
o
shepherd
seize
them
from
behind
and
lay
them
down
hold
them
and
overcome
them
strike
their
heads
pierce
their
breasts
they
are
gone
never
may
they
return
with
the
wind
may
they
go
with
the
storm
above
it
take
their
road
and
cut
off
their
going
seize
their
mouths
seize
their
mouths
seize
their
weapons
seize
their
teeth
and
make
them
ascend
by
the
command
of
ea

lord
of
wisdom
by
the
command
of
merodach

lord

revelation
gazelle
and
goat
gods
the
gazelle
or
antelope
was
a
mythological
animal
in
babylonia
so
far
as
it
represented
ea
who
is
entitled
princely
gazelle
and
gazelle
who
gives
the
earth
but
this
animal
was
also
appropriated
to
the
god
of
nippur
who
was
specially
called
the
god
it
is
likely
therefore
that
this
animal
had
been
worshipped
totemically
at
nippur
scores
of
early
cylinders
represent
it
being
offered
in
sacrifice
to
a
god
and
and
other
carvings
show
it
reposing
in
the
arms
of
various
deities
the
goat
too
seems
to
have
been
peculiarly
sacred
and
formed
one
of
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
a
god
called
uz
has
for
his
name
the
akkadian
word
for
goat
mr
hormuzd
rassam
found
a
sculptured
stone
tablet
in
a
temple
of
the
at
sippara
on
which
was
an
inscription
to
sin
shamash
and
ishtar
as
being
set
as
companions
at
the
approach
to
the
deep
in
sight
of
the
god
uz
this
god
uz
is
depicted
as
sitting
on
a
throne
watching
the
revolution
of
the
solar
disc
which
is
placed
upon
a
table
and
made
to
revolve
by
means
of
a
rope
or
string
he
is
clad
in
a
robe
of
the
goat
cult
this
cult
of
the
goat
appears
to
be
of
very
ancient
origin
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
it
seems
to
have
found
its
way
into
mediæval
and
even
into
modern
magic
and
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
it
is
the
baphomet
of
the
and
the
sabbatic
goat
of
the
witchcraft
of
the
middle
ages
it
seems
almost
certain
that
when
the
crusaders
sojourned
in
they
came
into
contact
with
the
remains
of
the
old
babylonian
cult
when
philip
the
fair
of
france
arraigned
them
on
a
charge
of
heresy
a
great
deal
of
curious
evidence
was
extorted
from
them
regarding
the
worship
of
an
idol
that
they
kept
in
their
lodges
the
real
character
of
this
they
seemed
unable
to
explain
it
was
said
which
the
image
was
made
in
the
likeness
of
which
name
was
said
to
be
a
corruption
of
mahomet
the
general
christian
name
at
that
period
for
a
pagan
idol
although
others
give
a
greek
derivation
for
the
word
this
figure
was
often
described
as
possessing
a
goat
head
and
horns
that
too
the
sabbatic
goat
of
the
middle
ages
was
of
eastern
and
probably
babylonian
origin
is
scarcely
to
be
doubted
at
the
witch
orgies
in
france
and
elsewhere
those
who
were
afterwards
brought
to
book
for
their
sorceries
declared
that
satan
appeared
to
them
in
the
shape
of
a
goat
and
that
they
worshipped
him
in
this
form
the
sabbatic
meetings
during
the
fifteenth
century
in
the
wood
of
mofflaines
near
arras
had
as
their
centre
a
with
a
human
countenance
and
a
like
fiend
was
adored
in
germany
and
in
scotland
from
all
this
it
is
clear
that
the
sabbatic
goat
must
have
had
some
connexion
with
the
east
eliphas
levi
drew
a
picture
of
the
baphomet
or
sabbatic
goat
to
accompany
one
of
his
occult
works
and
strangely
enough
the
symbols
that
he
adorns
it
with
are
peculiarly
oriental
moreover
the
figures
in
the
drawing
now
levi
knew
nothing
of
babylonian
mythology
although
he
was
moderately
versed
in
the
mythology
of
modern
occultism
and
it
would
seem
that
if
he
drew
his
information
from
modern
or
mediæval
sources
that
these
must
have
been
in
direct
line
from
babylonian
lore
adar
the
of
nippur
was
in
the
same
manner
connected
with
the
pig
which
may
have
been
the
totem
of
the
city
he
ruled
over
and
many
other
gods
had
attendant
animals
or
birds
like
the
of
kis
whose
symbol
was
the
eagle
those
monsters
who
had
composed
the
host
of
tiawath
were
supposed
after
the
defeat
and
destruction
of
their
commandress
to
have
been
hurled
like
satan
and
his
angels
into
the
abyss
beneath
we
read
of
their
confusion
in
four
tablets
of
the
creation
epic
this
legend
seems
to
be
the
original
source
of
the
belief
that
those
who
rebelled
against
high
heaven
were
thrust
into
outer
darkness
in
the
book
of
enoch
we
read
of
a
abyss
regarding
which
an
angel
said
to
the
prophet
this
is
a
place
of
the
consummation
of
heaven
and
earth
and
again
in
a
later
chapter
these
are
of
the
stars
who
have
transgressed
the
command
of
god
the
highest
and
are
bound
here
till
worlds
the
number
of
the
days
of
their
sins
shall
have
consummated
this
is
the
prison
of
the
angels
and
here
they
are
held
to
eternity
eleven
great
monsters
are
spoken
of
by
babylonian
myth
as
comprising
the
host
of
tiawath
besides
many
lesser
forms
having
the
heads
of
men
and
the
bodies
of
birds
strangely
enough
we
find
these
monsters
figuring
in
a
legend
concerning
an
early
babylonian
king
the
invasion
of
the
monsters
the
tablets
upon
which
this
legend
was
impressed
were
at
first
known
as
cuthæan
legend
of
creation
a
misnomer
for
this
legend
does
not
give
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
at
all
but
deals
with
the
invasion
of
babylonia
by
a
race
of
monsters
who
were
descended
from
the
gods
and
who
waged
war
against
the
legendary
king
of
the
period
for
three
years
the
king
tells
the
story
himself
unfortunately
the
first
portions
of
both
tablets
containing
the
story
are
missing
and
we
plunge
right
away
into
a
description
of
the
dread
beings
who
came
upon
the
people
of
babylonia
in
their
multitudes
we
are
told
that
they
preferred
muddy
water
to
clear
water
these
creatures
says
the
king
were
without
moral
sense
glorying
in
their
power
and
slaughtering
those
whom
they
took
captives
they
had
the
bodies
of
birds
and
some
of
them
had
the
faces
of
ravens
they
had
evidently
been
fostered
by
the
gods
in
some
inaccessible
region
and
multiplying
greatly
they
came
like
a
on
the
land
in
number
their
king
was
called
benini
their
mother
melili
and
their
leader
memangab
who
had
six
subordinates
the
king
perplexed
knew
not
what
to
do
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
gave
them
battle
he
might
in
some
way
offend
the
gods
but
at
last
through
his
priests
he
addressed
the
divine
beings
and
made
offerings
of
lambs
in
sacrifice
to
them
he
received
a
favourable
answer
and
decided
to
give
battle
to
the
invaders
against
whom
he
sent
an
army
of
men
but
not
one
of
these
returned
alive
again
he
sent
warriors
to
meet
them
but
the
same
fate
overtook
these
and
in
the
third
year
he
despatched
an
army
of
nearly
troops
all
of
whom
perished
to
a
man
then
the
unfortunate
monarch
broke
down
and
groaning
aloud
cried
out
that
he
had
brought
misfortune
and
destruction
upon
his
realm
nevertheless
rising
from
his
lethargy
of
despair
he
stated
his
intention
to
go
forth
against
the
enemy
in
his
own
person
saying
the
pride
of
this
people
of
the
night
i
will
curse
with
death
and
destruction
with
fear
terror
and
famine
and
with
misery
of
every
kind
before
setting
out
to
meet
the
foe
he
made
offerings
to
the
gods
the
manner
in
which
he
overcame
the
invaders
is
by
no
means
clear
from
the
text
but
it
would
seem
that
he
annihilated
them
by
means
of
a
deluge
in
the
last
portion
of
the
legend
the
king
exhorts
his
successors
not
to
lose
heart
when
in
great
peril
but
to
take
courage
from
his
example
he
inscribed
a
tablet
with
his
advice
which
he
placed
in
the
shrine
of
nergal
in
the
city
of
cuthah
strengthen
thy
wall
he
said
fill
thy
cisterns
with
water
bring
in
thy
and
thy
corn
and
thy
silver
and
all
thy
possessions
he
also
advises
those
of
his
descendants
who
are
faced
by
similar
conditions
not
to
expose
themselves
needlessly
to
the
enemy
it
was
thought
at
one
time
that
this
legend
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
the
creation
and
that
the
speaker
was
the
god
nergal
who
was
waging
war
against
the
brood
of
tiawath
it
was
believed
that
according
to
local
conditions
at
cuthah
nergal
would
have
taken
the
place
of
merodach
but
it
has
now
been
made
clear
that
although
the
tablet
was
intended
to
be
placed
in
the
shrine
of
nergal
the
speaker
was
in
reality
an
early
babylonian
king
illustration
mythological
being
in
the
photo
mansell
and
the
eagle
as
we
have
seen
the
eagle
was
perhaps
regarded
as
a
symbol
of
the
a
babylonian
fable
tells
how
he
quarrelled
with
the
serpent
and
incurred
the
reptile
hatred
feeling
hungry
he
resolved
to
eat
the
serpent
young
and
communicated
his
intention
to
his
own
family
one
of
his
children
advised
him
not
to
devour
the
serpent
brood
because
if
he
did
so
he
would
incur
the
enmity
of
the
god
shamash
but
the
eagle
did
not
hearken
to
his
offspring
and
swooping
down
from
heaven
sought
out
the
serpent
nest
and
devoured
his
young
on
his
arrival
at
home
the
serpent
discovered
his
loss
and
at
once
repaired
in
great
indignation
to
shamash
to
whom
he
appealed
for
justice
his
nest
he
told
the
god
was
set
in
a
tree
and
the
eagle
had
swooped
upon
it
destroying
it
with
his
mighty
wings
and
devouring
the
little
serpents
as
they
fell
from
it
help
o
shamash
cried
the
serpent
thy
net
is
like
unto
the
broad
earth
thy
snare
is
like
unto
the
distant
heaven
in
wideness
who
can
escape
thee
shamash
hearkening
to
his
appeal
described
to
him
how
he
might
succeed
in
obtaining
vengeance
upon
the
eagle
take
the
road
said
he
and
go
into
the
mountain
and
hide
thyself
in
the
dead
body
of
a
wild
ox
tear
open
its
body
and
all
the
birds
of
heaven
shall
swoop
down
upon
it
the
eagle
shall
come
with
the
rest
and
when
he
seeks
for
the
best
parts
of
the
carcase
do
thou
seize
him
by
his
wing
tear
off
his
wings
his
pinions
and
his
claws
pull
him
in
pieces
and
cast
him
into
a
pit
there
may
he
die
a
death
from
hunger
and
thirst
the
serpent
did
as
shamash
had
bidden
him
he
soon
came
upon
the
body
of
a
wild
ox
into
which
he
glided
after
opening
up
the
carcase
shortly
afterwards
he
heard
the
beating
of
the
wings
of
numberless
birds
all
of
which
swooped
down
and
ate
of
the
flesh
but
the
eagle
suspected
the
purpose
of
the
serpent
and
did
not
come
with
the
rest
until
greed
and
hunger
prompted
him
to
share
in
the
feast
come
said
he
to
his
children
let
us
swoop
down
and
let
us
also
eat
of
the
flesh
of
this
wild
ox
now
the
young
eagle
who
had
before
dissuaded
his
father
from
devouring
the
serpent
young
again
begged
him
to
desist
from
his
purpose
have
a
care
o
my
father
he
said
for
i
am
certain
that
the
serpent
lurks
in
yonder
carcase
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
you
but
the
eagle
did
not
hearken
to
the
warning
of
his
child
but
swooped
on
to
the
carcase
of
the
wild
ox
he
so
far
obeyed
the
injunctions
of
his
offspring
however
as
closely
to
examine
the
dead
ox
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
any
trap
lurked
near
it
satisfied
that
all
was
well
he
commenced
to
feed
upon
it
when
suddenly
the
serpent
seized
upon
him
and
held
him
fast
the
eagle
at
once
began
to
plead
for
mercy
but
the
enraged
reptile
told
him
that
an
appeal
to
shamash
was
irrevocable
and
that
if
he
did
not
punish
the
king
of
birds
he
himself
would
be
punished
by
the
god
and
despite
the
eagle
further
protests
he
tore
off
his
wings
and

pulled
him
to

tales
of
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
kings
the
tales
of
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
kings
which
we
present
in
this
chapter
are
of
value
because
they
are
taken
at
first
hand
from
their
own
historical
accounts
of
the
great
events
which
occurred
during
their
several
reigns
on
a
first
examination
these
tablets
appear
dry
and
uninteresting
but
when
studied
more
closely
and
patiently
they
will
be
found
to
contain
matter
as
absorbing
as
that
in
the
most
exciting
annals
of
any
country
let
us
take
for
example
the
wonderful
inscriptions
of
ii
which
refer
to
his
various
conquests
and
which
were
discovered
by
george
smith
at
nimrûd
in
the
temple
of
nebo
tiglath
commences
with
the
usual
oriental
flourish
of
trumpets
he
styles
himself
the
powerful
warrior
who
in
the
service
of
asshur
has
trampled
upon
his
haters
swept
over
them
like
a
flood
and
reduced
them
to
shadows
he
has
marched
he
says
from
the
sea
to
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
and
from
the
sea
of
the
setting
sun
to
egypt
he
enumerates
the
countless
lands
that
he
has
conquered
the
cities
sarrapanu
and
malilatu
among
others
he
took
by
storm
and
captured
the
inhabitants
to
the
number
of
men
women
and
children
all
of
whom
he
sent
to
assyria
much
tribute
he
received
from
the
people
of
the
conquered
lands
gold
silver
precious
stones
rare
woods
and
cattle
his
custom
seems
to
have
been
to
make
his
successful
generals
rulers
of
the
cities
he
conquered
and
it
is
noticeable
that
upon
a
victory
he
invariably
sacrificed
to
the
gods
his
methods
appear
to
have
been
drastic
in
the
extreme
irritated
at
the
defiance
of
the
people
of
sarrapanu
he
reduced
it
to
a
heap
of
earth
and
crucified
king
in
front
of
the
gate
of
his
city
not
content
with
this
vengeance
tiglath
carried
off
his
wealth
his
furniture
his
wife
his
son
his
daughters
and
lastly
his
gods
so
that
no
trace
of
the
wretched
monarch
kingdom
should
remain
it
is
noticeable
that
throughout
these
campaigns
tiglath
invariably
sent
the
prisoners
to
assyria
which
shows
at
least
that
he
considered
human
life
as
relatively
sacred
probably
these
captive
people
were
reduced
to
slavery
the
races
of
the
neighbouring
desert
too
came
and
prostrated
themselves
before
the
assyrian
hero
kissing
his
feet
and
bringing
him
tribute
carried
by
sailors
tiglath
then
begins
to
boast
about
his
gorgeous
new
residence
with
all
the
vulgarity
of
a
he
says
that
his
house
was
decorated
like
a
syrian
palace
for
his
glory
he
built
gates
of
ivory
with
planks
of
cedar
and
seems
to
have
had
his
prisoners
the
conquered
kings
of
syria
on
exhibition
in
the
palace
precincts
at
the
gates
were
gigantic
lions
and
bulls
of
clever
workmanship
which
he
describes
as
cunning
beautiful
valuable
and
this
place
he
called
palaces
of
rejoicing
illustration
capture
of
sarrapanu
by
evelyn
paul
in
a
fragment
which
relates
the
circumstances
of
his
eastern
expeditions
he
tells
how
he
built
a
city
called
humur
and
how
he
excavated
the
neighbouring
river
patti
which
had
been
filled
up
in
the
past
and
along
its
bed
led
refreshing
waters
into
certain
of
the
cities
he
had
conquered
he
complains
in
one
text
that
sarduri
the
king
of
ararat
revolted
against
him
along
with
others
but
tiglath
captured
his
camp
and
sarduri
had
perforce
to
escape
upon
a
mare
into
the
rugged
mountains
he
rode
by
night
and
sought
safety
on
their
peaks
later
he
took
refuge
with
his
warriors
in
the
city
of
turuspa
after
a
siege
tiglath
succeeded
in
reducing
the
place
afterwards
he
destroyed
the
land
of
ararat
and
made
it
a
desert
over
an
area
of
about
miles
tiglath
dedicated
sarduri
couch
to
ishtar
and
carried
off
his
royal
riding
carriage
his
seal
his
necklace
his
royal
chariot
his
mace
and
lastly
a
ship
though
we
are
not
told
how
he
accomplished
this
last
feat
poet
or
braggart
it
is
strange
to
notice
the
inflated
manner
in
which
tiglath
speaks
in
these
descriptions
he
talks
about
people
races
and
rulers
against
him
as
if
he
were
a
god
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
like
other
assyrian
monarchs
regarded
himself
as
the
representative
of
the
gods
upon
earth
but
though
his
language
is
at
times
boastful
and
absurd
yet
on
other
occasions
it
is
extremely
beautiful
and
even
poetic
in
speaking
of
the
tribute
he
received
from
various
monarchs
he
says
that
he
obtained
from
them
clothing
of
wool
and
linen
violet
wool
royal
treasures
the
skins
of
sheep
with
fleece
dyed
in
shining
purple
birds
of
the
sky
with
feathers
of
shining
violet
horses
camels
and
with
their
young
ones
he
appears
too
to
have
been
in
conflict
with
a
queen
of
sheba
or
saba
one
samsi
whom
he
sent
as
a
prisoner
to
syria
with
her
gods
and
all
her
possessions
the
autobiography
of
in
a
former
chapter
we
outlined
the
mythical
history
of
or
sardanapalus
and
in
this
place
may
briefly
review
the
story
of
his
life
as
told
in
his
inscriptions
he
commences
by
stating
that
he
is
the
child
of
asshur
and
beltis
but
he
evidently
intends
to
convey
that
he
is
their
son
in
a
spiritual
sense
only
for
he
hastens
to
tell
us
that
he
is
the
son
of
the
great
king
of
riduti
he
proceeds
to
tell
of
his
triumphal
progress
throughout
egypt
whose
kings
he
made
tributary
to
him
then
he
remarks
in
a
hurt
manner
the
good
i
did
to
them
they
despised
and
their
hearts
devised
evil
seditious
words
they
spoke
and
took
evil
counsel
among
themselves
in
short
the
kings
of
egypt
had
entered
into
an
alliance
to
free
themselves
from
the
yoke
of
but
his
generals
heard
of
the
plot
and
captured
several
of
the
ringleaders
in
the
midst
of
their
work
they
seized
the
royal
conspirators
and
bound
them
in
fetters
of
iron
the
assyrian
generals
then
fell
upon
the
populations
of
the
revolting
cities
and
cut
off
their
inhabitants
to
a
man
but
they
brought
the
rulers
of
egypt
to
nineveh
into
the
presence
of
to
do
him
justice
that
monarch
treated
necho
who
is
described
as
of
memphis
and
sars
with
the
utmost
consideration
granting
him
a
new
covenant
and
placing
upon
him
costly
garments
and
ornaments
of
gold
bracelets
of
gold
a
steel
sword
with
a
sheath
of
gold
with
chariots
mules
and
horses
dream
of
gyges
continuing
recounts
how
gyges
king
of
lydia
a
remote
place
of
which
his
fathers
had
not
heard
the
name
was
granted
a
dream
concerning
the
kingdom
of
assyria
by
the
god
asshur
gyges
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
dream
and
sent
to
to
request
his
friendship
but
having
once
sent
an
envoy
to
the
assyrian
court
seemed
to
think
that
he
should
continue
to
do
so
regularly
and
when
he
failed
in
this
attention
the
assyrian
king
prayed
to
asshur
to
compass
his
discomfiture
shortly
afterwards
the
unhappy
gyges
was
overthrown
by
the
cimmerians
against
whom
had
often
assisted
him
then
plaintively
recounts
how
saulmugina
his
younger
brother
conspired
against
him
this
brother
he
had
made
king
of
babylon
and
after
occupying
the
throne
of
that
country
for
some
time
he
set
on
foot
a
conspiracy
to
throw
off
the
assyrian
yoke
a
seer
told
that
he
had
had
a
dream
in
which
the
god
sin
spoke
to
him
saying
that
he
would
overthrow
and
destroy
saulmugina
and
his
marched
against
his
brother
whom
he
overthrew
the
people
of
babylon
overtaken
by
famine
were
forced
to
devour
their
own
children
and
in
their
agony
they
attacked
saulmugina
and
burned
him
to
death
with
his
goods
his
treasures
and
his
wives
as
we
have
before
pointed
out
this
tale
strangely
enough
closely
resembles
the
legend
concerning
himself
swift
was
the
vengeance
of
the
assyrian
king
upon
those
who
remained
he
cut
out
the
tongues
of
some
while
others
were
thrown
into
pits
to
be
eaten
by
dogs
bears
and
eagles
then
after
fixing
a
tribute
and
setting
governors
over
them
he
returned
to
assyria
it
is
noticeable
that
distinctly
states
that
he
upon
the
babylonians
the
gods
of
assyria
and
this
seems
to
show
that
assyrian
deities
existed
in
contradistinction
to
those
of
babylonia
in
one
expedition
into
the
land
of
elam
had
a
dream
sent
by
ishtar
to
assure
him
that
the
crossing
of
the
river
itite
which
was
in
high
flood
could
be
accomplished
by
his
army
in
perfect
safety
the
warriors
easily
negotiated
the
crossing
and
inflicted
great
losses
upon
the
enemy
among
other
things
they
dragged
the
idol
of
susinay
from
its
sacred
grove
and
he
remarks
that
it
had
never
been
beheld
by
any
man
in
elam
this
with
other
idols
he
carried
off
to
assyria
he
broke
the
winged
lions
which
flanked
the
gates
of
the
temple
dried
up
the
drinking
wells
and
for
a
month
and
a
day
swept
elam
to
its
utmost
extent
so
that
neither
man
nor
oxen
nor
trees
could
be
found
in
it
nothing
but
the
wild
ass
the
serpent
and
the
beast
of
the
desert
the
king
goes
on
to
say
that
the
goddess
nanâ
who
had
dwelt
in
elam
for
over
years
had
been
desecrated
by
so
doing
that
country
he
declares
was
a
place
not
suited
to
her
the
return
of
her
divinity
she
had
trusted
to
me
she
said
me
out
from
the
midst
of
wicked
elam
and
cause
me
to
enter
the
temple
of
anna
the
goddess
then
took
the
road
to
the
temple
of
anna
at
erech
where
the
king
raised
to
her
an
enduring
sanctuary
those
chiefs
who
had
trusted
the
elamites
now
felt
afflicted
at
heart
and
began
to
despair
and
one
of
them
like
saul
begged
his
own
to
slay
him
master
and
man
killing
each
other
refused
to
give
his
corpse
burial
and
cutting
off
its
head
hung
it
round
the
neck
of
one
of
the
followers
of
saulmugina
his
rebellious
brother
in
another
text
recounts
in
grandiloquent
language
how
he
built

temples

by
permission
of
messrs
hutchinson
and
a
monarch
the
father
of
has
been
called
the
most
likeable
of
the
assyrian
kings
he
did
not
press
his
military
conquests
for
the
mere
sake
of
glory
but
in
general
for
the
maintenance
of
his
own
territory
he
is
notable
as
the
restorer
of
babu
and
the
reviver
of
its
culture
he
showed
much
clemency
to
political
offenders
and
his
court
was
the
centre
of
literary
activity
his
son
speaks
warmly
of
the
sound
education
he
received
at
his
father
court
and
to
that
education
and
its
enlightening
influences
we
now
owe
the
priceless
series
of
cylinders
and
inscriptions
found
in
his
library
he
does
not
seem
to
have
been
able
to
control
his
rather
turbulent
neighbours
and
he
was
actually
weak
enough
from
the
assyrian
point
of
view
to
return
the
gods
of
the
kingdom
of
aribi
after
he
had
led
them
captive
to
assyria
he
seems
to
have
been
enlightened
and
and
if
he
did
not
boast
so
loudly
as
his
son
he
had
probably
greater
reason
to
do
so
one
of
the
descendants
of
speaks
of
his
restoration
of
certain
temples
especially
that
of
nebo
and
plaintively
adds
in
after
days
in
the
time
of
the
kings
my
sons
when
this
house
decays
and
becomes
old
who
repairs
its
ruin
and
restores
its
decay
may
he
who
does
so
see
my
name
written
on
this
inscription
may
he
enclose
it
in
a
receptacle
pour
out
a
libation
and
write
my
name
with
his
own
but
whoever
defaces
the
writing
of
my
name
may
the
gods
not
establish
him
may
they
curse
and
destroy
his
seed
from
the
land
this
is
the
last
royal
inscription
of
any
length
written
in
assyria
and
its
almost
prophetic
terms
seem
to
suggest
that
he
who
framed
them
must
have
foreseen
the
downfall
of
the
civilization
he
represented
does
not
the
inscription
almost
foreshadow

us
with
a
picturesque
incident
this
assyrian
monarch
had
marched
several
times
into
syria
and
had
fought
the
chaldeans
in

the

surely
a
more
extreme
manner
of
dealing
summarily
with
a
conquered
enemy
has
never
been
recorded
although
the
life
of
the
babylonian
or
assyrian
king
was
lived
in
the
full
glare
of
publicity
he
had
not
to
encounter
the
same
criticism
as
regards
his
actions
that
monarchs
must
face
for
the
moral
code
of
the
peoples
of
mesopotamia
was
fundamentally
different
from
that
which
obtains
at
the
present
time
as
the
monarch
was
regarded
as
the
vicegerent
of
the
gods
upon
earth
it
therefore
followed
that
he
could
do
no
wrong
submission
to
his
will
was
complete
in
the
hands
of
a
race
of
men
who
wielded
this
power
unwisely
it
could
have
been
nothing
else
but
disastrous
to
both
prince
and
people
but
on
the
whole
it
may
be
said
that
the
kings
of
this
race
bore
themselves
worthily
according
to
their
lights
if
their
sense
of
dignity
at
times
amounted
to
bombast
that
was
because
they
were
so
full
of
their
sense
of
delegated
duty
from
above
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
before
entering
upon
their
kingly
state
they
had
to
undergo
a
most
rigorous
education
consisting
of
instruction
upon
religious
subjects
some
history
and
the
inculcation
of
moral
precepts
on
the
other
hand
they
were
by
no
means
mere
puppets
for
we
find
them
initiating
campaigns
presiding
over
courts
of
law
and
framing
the
laws
themselves
and
generally
guiding
the
trend
of
the
national
policy
as
a
whole
they
were
a
strong
and
determined
race
wise
as
well
as
warlike
and
by
no
means
unmindful
of
the
requirements
of
their
people
but
with
them
the
gods
were
first
and
their
reading
of
the
initial
duty
of
a
king
seems
to
have
been
the
building
of
temples
and
the
celebration
of
religious
ceremonies
of
which
a
gorgeous
and
prolonged
ritual
was
the
especial
feature

a
sketch
of
a
day
in
the
life
of
an
assyrian
or
babylonian
king
may
assist
the
reader
to
visualize
the
habits
of
royalty
in
a
distant
era
the
ceremonies
of
robing
and
ablution
upon
rising
would
necessitate
the
attendance
of
numerous
special
officials
and
the
morning
repast
over
a
private
religious
ceremony
would
follow
the
business
of
the
court
would
supervene
perhaps
an
embassy
from
elam
or
egypt
would
occupy
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
failing
which
the
dictation
of
letters
to
the
governors
of
provinces
and
cities
or
to
distant
potentates
would
be
overtaken
as
a
scholar
himself
the
king
would
probably
carefully
scrutinize
these
productions
a
visit
might
then
be
paid
to
a
temple
in
course
of
construction
where
the
architect
would
describe
the
progress
of
the
building
operations
and
the
king
would
watch
the
slow
rising
of
shrine
and
tower
or
perhaps
the
afternoon
would
be
set
apart
for
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
leashes
of
great
dogs
not
unlike
those
of
the
danish
boarhound
breed
would
be
gathered
at
a
certain
point
and
setting
out
in
a
light
but
strong
chariot
the
king
would
soon
arrive
at
that
point
where
the
beaters
had
assured
themselves
of
the
presence
of
gazelles
wild
asses
or
even
lions
matters
would
of
course
be
so
arranged
that
the
chief
glories
of
the
day
should
be
left
with
royalty
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
king
was
accompanied
by
his
courtiers
in
the
chase
as
was
the
case
in
the
middle
ages
or
if
he
was
merely
attended
by
professional
huntsmen
be
that
as
it
may
when
the
ceremony
of
pouring
libations
over
the
dead
game
came
to
be
celebrated
we
find
no
one
except
the
king
the
harpers
and
professional
huntsmen
present
for
the
kings
of
this
virile
and
warlike
race
did
not
disdain
to
face
the
lion
unattended
and
armed
with
nothing
but
bow
and
arrows
and
a
short
falchion
unless
the
inscriptions
which
they
have
left
on
record
are
altogether
mendacious
we
must
believe
that
many
an
assyrian
king
risked
his
life
in
close
combat
with
lions
great
risk
attends
when
the
sportsman
is
armed
with
modern
weapons
of
precision
but
the
risk
attending
a
personal
encounter
with
these
savage
animals
when
the
hunter
is
armed
with
the
most
rudimentary
weapons
seems
appalling
according
to
modern
civilized
ideas

edifice

the
celebration
of
a

the

attended
by
a

retinue

courtiers

would
be
carried
in

litter

hymns
to

were

the

assyrian

was
probably
not

comfortable

he
was
by
sycophantic
officials
spies
in
the

in

oriental
countries
the

was
the

of

its
occupants
were
usually
princesses
from
foreign
countries
who
had
probably
received
injunctions
on
leaving

there
is
little

that
the

it
was
to

to
their

of

babylon
or

swarmed
in

occupied
a

attainments

was

were

by

to
have
obtained

the
babylonians

to

the

the
comparative
value
of
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
religions
the
comparative
value
of
the
religions
of
babylonia
and
assyria
is
very
high
as
they
represent
semitic
polytheism
in
evolution
and
in
a
state
of
prosperity
though
hardly
in
decay
they
are
in
fact
typical
of
semitic
religion
as
a
whole
and
as
the
semitic
race
initiated
no
less
than
three
of
the
great
religious
systems
of
the
world
judaism
christianity
and
mohammedanism
they
are
well
worth
careful
study
on
the
part
of
those
who
desire
to
specialize
in
religious
science
it
is
however
for
a
variety
of
reasons
inevitable
that
we
should
compare
them
most
frequently
with
the
religion
of
israel
the
faith
that
in
general
most
resembled
them
although
a
wide
cleavage
existed
between
the
ethics
of
that
system
and
their
moral
outlook
that
notwithstanding
there
was
direct
contact
between
the
babylonian
and
jewish
religions
for
a
prolonged
period
and
the
influence
thus
absorbed
was
quickened
by
racial
relationship
ere
we
deal
with
these
purely
semitic
and
racial
resemblances
which
are
so
important
for
the
proper
comprehension
of
biblical
history
and
religious
science
in
general
let
us
briefly
compare
the
faith
of
babylonia
and
assyria
with
some
of
the
great
religious
systems
of
the
world
it
perhaps
more
closely
resembles
the
composite
general
egyptian
religious
idea
one
can
not
speak
of
an
egyptian
religion
than
any
other
but
whereas
in
egypt
the
deities
had
been
almost
universally
evolved
from
nome
or
totemic
or
otherwise
a
number
often
coalesced
in
one
form
the
gods
of
chaldea
were
usually
or
showing
much
less
of
the
nature
of
the
departmental
deity
in
their
construction
than
the
divinities
of
egypt
the
egyptian
was
more
exact
and
explicit
we
have
seldom
much
difficulty
in
discovering
the
nature
of
an
egyptian
god
we
have
frequently
however
immense
trouble
in
finding
out
for
what
a
mesopotamian
deity
stands
the
idea
of
godhead
appears
to
have
been
principally
astral
terrestrial
or
aquatic
that
is
most
deities
are
connected
either
with
the
heavenly
bodies
the
earth
or
the
waters
it
is
only
as
an
afterthought
that
they
become
gods
of
justice
of
letters
of
the
underworld
this
statement
must
of
course
be
taken
as
meaning
that
their
connexion
with
abstract
qualities
is
much
more
loose
than
in
the
case
of
the
egyptian
gods
that
their
departmental
character
is
secondary
to
their
original
character
as
gods
of
nature
there
is
only
one
exception
to
this
and
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
department
of
war
to
which
certain
of
them
appear
to
have
been
relegated
at
an
early
period
and
later
to
have
become
identified
with
it
very
closely
indeed
in
one
circumstance
the
religion
closely
resembled
the
egyptian
and
that
was
the
lasting
effect
wrought
upon
it
by
priestly
cults
and
theological
schools
just
as
the
priests
of
thebes
and
memphis
and
on
moulded
the
varying
cults
of
egypt
added
to
their
mythology
and
read
into
them
ethical
significance
so
did
the
priests
of
nippur
and
erech
mould
and
form
the
faith
of
babylon
we
have
plenty
of
evidence
for
such
a
statement
and
nowhere
perhaps
was
theological
thought
so
rife
in
the
ancient
world
as
in
babylonia
and
egypt
there
are
also
points
of
contact
with
the
great
mythological
system
of
greece
that
system
which
was
so
much
a
mythology
that
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
religion
that
greece
borrowed
largely
from
mesopotamia
is
not
to
be
doubted
but
we
find
the
hellenic
departmental
deities
very
explicit
indeed
in
their
nature
pallas
for
example
stands
for
wisdom
poseidon
for
the
sea
ares
for
war
and
so
forth
one
god
usually
possesses
one
attribute
and
although
zeus
has
a
number
of
minor
attributes
we
do
not
find
him
combining
in
his
one
person
so
many
as
does
merodach
as
has
been
said
it
would
seem
that
the
departmental
character
of
many
babylonian
gods
was
purely
accidental
or
fortuitous
the
formula
seems
to
run
take
a
local
or
city
god
probably
derived
from
totemic
sources
or
perhaps
of
animistic
origin
and
having
conquered
much
surrounding
territory
exalt
him
to
the
position
of
the
god
of
a
large
region
which
being
incorporated
again
with
a
still
larger
empire
leaves
him
only
a
local
status
this
status
he
can
not
hold
in
a
pantheon
where
each
member
must
possess
a
specific
attribute
therefore
it
becomes
necessary
to
impose
upon
him
some
quality
by
which
he
can
be
specially
recognized
sometimes
that
quality
is
suitable
to
his
character
in
fact
it
may
be
indicated
by
it
but
at
other
times
it
is
merely
arbitrary
why
for
example
should
ishtar
have
been
made
a
goddess
of
war
by
the
assyrians
this
bestowal
of
departmental
characteristics
upon
the
gods
of
babylonia
and
assyria
was
contemporary
with
the
erection
of
these
countries
into
empires
no
pantheon
can
exist
on
high
without
a
political
reflex
in
the
world
below
like
the
granting
of
most
departmental
offices
in
religious
systems
these
changes
took
place
at
a
comparatively
late
date
in
the
evolution
of
semitic
religion
whenever
we
find
the
departmental
deities
of
a
religious
system
more
or
less
sharply
outlined
as
to
their
duties
and
status
we
may
premise
two
things
first
that
temporal
power
has
been
acquired
by
the
race
which
conceived
them
and
secondly
that
this
power
is
of
comparatively
recent
origin
semitic
conservatism
when
we
speak
of
departmental
deities
of
a
country
like
babylonia
or
egypt
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
these
lands
knew
so
many
dynasties
and
had
such
an
extended
history
that
their
religious
systems
must
from
first
to
last
have
experienced
the
most
profound
changes
in
egypt
for
example
religious
phenomena
altered
slowly
and
by
imperceptible
degrees
the
changes
experienced
in
the
course
of
fifty
centuries
of
religious
evolution
must
have
made
the
cults
of
egypt
exhibit
very
different
conditions
at
the
close
of
their
development
from
let
us
say
those
seen
midway
in
their
evolutionary
course
we
have
seen
how
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
faiths
altered
in
the
course
of
generations
but
withal
there
appears
to
have
been
something
more
strongly
conservative
in
the
nature
of
semitic
religion
than
in
any
other
probably
in
no
other
land
did
the
same
ritual
and
the
same
religious
practices
obtain
over
so
long
a
period
as
in
babylonia
where
the
national
life
was
much
stronger
and
much
more
centralized
than
in
egypt
and
where
if
rival
cults
did
exist
they
were
all
subservient
to
one
as
was
by
no
means
the
case
in
the
land
of
the
nile
teutonic
and
celtic
comparisons
compared
with
the
great
germanic
religion
the
babylonian
offers
few
points
of
resemblance
in
the
faith
of
the
teutons
departmental
deities
were
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
in
fact
in
no
mythic
system
are
the
gods
so
associated
with
departments
as
in
the
teutonic
and
this
despite
the
fact
that
no
definite
empire
was
ruled
by
teutonic
tribes
was
the
teutonic
system
the
remains
of
a
religious
aristocracy
which
had
hived
off
from
some
centre
of
political
power
nor
do
the
semitic
religions
have
much
in
common
with
the
celtic
so
far
as
their
basis
of
polity
is
concerned
although
numerous
valiant
attempts
have
been
made
by
antiquarian
gentlemen
of
the
type
so
common
half
a
century
ago
and
not
yet
defunct
to
prove
babylonian
influence
upon
celtic
faith
and
story
thus
we
have
been
told
that
the
celtic
bilé
was
as
certainly
allied
to
the
semitic
bel
as
the
roman
mars
was
to
the
greek
ares
and
this
of
course
through
phœnician
influence
the
people
of
tyre
and
sidon
having
been
traced
to
ireland
as
colonists
these
are
of
course
not
worth
the
paper
they
are
printed
upon
any
more
than
is
the
supposition
that
the
festival
of
beltane
has
any
connexion
with
the
babylonian
bel
it
was
in
fact
presided
over
by
the
god
bilé
a
celtic
deity
who
has
on
other
counts
been
confounded
with
the
babylonian
god
babylonian
religion
typically
animistic
we
learn
then
from
the
comparison
of
the
babylonian
religion
with
that
of
other
ancient
races
one
circumstance
of
outstanding
importance
that
is
if
the
babylonian
gods
were
so
perfunctorily
attached
to
departments
expressive
of
their
functions
and
were
so
closely
bound
to
the
elements
that
they
must
have
had
an
elemental
origin
that
they
were
indeed
originally
spirits
of
the
earth
the
air
and
the
water
this
of
course
is
no
new
conclusion
only
the
circumstance
that
the
babylonian
gods
were
not
strictly
departmental
that
they
have
only
a
slight
hold
upon
their
offices
assists
in
proving
the
correctness
of
the
theory
of
their
elemental
origin
it
is
also
of
interest
to
the
student
of
comparative
religion
as
indicating
to
him
a
mythological
system
in
which
the
majority
of
the
gods
are
certainly
of
elemental
origin
as
opposed
to
totemic
or
fetishistic
origin
of
the
spiritistic
nature
of
the
babylonian
pantheon
small
doubt
remains
to
the
semite
in
whom
imagination
and
are
so
strongly
combined
animistic
influences
would
be
sure
to
appeal
most
strongly
it
stands
to
primitive
reason
that
if
man
is
gifted
with
life
so
is
everything
else
and
this
conviction
gives
imagination
full
play
we
do
not
discover
these
animistic
influences
so
strongly
entrenched
in
ancient
egypt
the
osirian
cult
is
certainly
animistic
to
a
degree
but
the
various
totemic
cults
which
rivalled
it
and
which
it
at
last
embraced
held
their
own
for
many
a
day
illustration
a
royal
hunt
see
photo
mansell
and
a
theory
one
outstanding
feature
of
babylonian
religion
is
the
worship
of
the
great
this
is
a
universal
religious
phase
but
in
few
systems
do
we
find
it
so
prominent
as
in
babylonia
and
indeed
in
the
whole
mesopotamian
tract
efforts
have
been
made
to
show
that
in
mesopotamia
there
encountered
one
another
two
streams
of
people
of
opposing
worship
one
worshipping
a
male
and
the
other
a
female
deity
with
those
who
worshipped
the
hunters
and
warriors
with
whom
women
were
considered
more
as
beasts
of
burden
than
anything
else
man
was
the
superior
being
the
other
people
who
worshipped
the
were
not
necessarily
more
civilized
the
origin
of
their
adoration
may
have
been
a
scarcity
of
women
in
the
tribe
where
these
two
streams
fused
the
worship
of
an
or
god
is
said
to
have
resulted
but
were
there
peoples
who
specifically
and
separately
worshipped
male
and
female
deities
if
certainty
can
be
approached
in
debating
such
matters
these
deities
would
assuredly
be
animistic
and
a
people
who
worship
animistic
gods
do
not
worship
one
god
or
one
sex
but
scores
of
of
both
sexes
wherever
we
find
a
too
we
are
almost
certain
to
discover
a
the
cult
of
the
great
was
of
rather
later
origin
all
localities
and
all
regions
in
the
semitic
world
possessed
such
a
deity
and
it
was
the
fusion
of
these
in
one
that
produced
ishtar
or
astarte
who
was
probably
also
the
of
the
ephesians
perhaps
the
best
parallel
to
this
semitic
worship
of
the
is
to
be
found
in
the
mythology
of
the
ancient
mexican
races
where
each
pueblo
or
possessed
its
several
of
whom
were
finally
merged
after
the
conquest
of
their
worshippers

babylonian
influence
on
jewish
religion
but
religion
is
chiefly
of
interest
to
the
student
of
comparative
religion
in
that
it
casts
a
flood
of
light
upon
that
wonderful
jewish
faith
with
which
the
history
of
our
own
is
so
closely
identified
professor
sayce
writes
there
was
one
nation
at
all
events
which
has
exercised
and
still
exercises
a
considerable
influence
upon
our
own
thought
and
life
and
which
had
been
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
religion
and
culture
of
babylonia
at
a
critical
epoch
in
its
history
the
influence
of
jewish
religion
upon
christianity
and
consequently
upon
the
races
that
have
been
moulded
by
christianity
has
been
lasting
and
profound
now
jewish
religion
was
intimately
bound
up
with
jewish
history
more
intimately
perhaps
than
has
been
the
case
with
any
other
great
religion
of
the
world
it
took
its
colouring
from
the
events
that
marked
the
political
life
of
the
hebrew
people
it
developed
in
unison
with
their
struggles
and
successes
their
trials
and
disappointments
its
great
devotional
utterance
the
book
of
psalms
is
national
not
individual
the
individual
in
it
has
merged
his
own
aspirations
and
sufferings
into
those
of
the
whole
community
the
course
of
jewish
prophecy
is
equally
stamped
with
the
impress
of
the
national
fortunes
it
grows
clearer
and
more
catholic
as
the
intercourse
of
the
jewish
people
with
those
around
them
becomes
wider
and
the
lesson
is
taught
at
last
that
the
god
of
the
jews
is
the
god
also
of
the
whole
world
now
the
chosen
instruments
for
enforcing
this
lesson
as
we
are
expressly
told
were
the
assyrian
and
babylonian
the
assyrian
was
the
rod
of
god
anger
while
the
babylonish
exile
was
the
bitter
punishment
meted
out
to
judah
for
its
sins
the
captives
who
returned
again
to
their
own
land
came
back
with
changed
hearts
and
purified
minds
from
henceforth
jerusalem
was
to
be
the
unrivalled
of
righteous
nation
which
keepeth
the
truth
apart
therefore
from
any
influence
which
the
old
religious
beliefs
of
babylonia
may
have
had
upon
the
greeks
and
which
as
we
shall
see
was
not
so
wholly
wanting
as
was
formerly
imagined
their
contact
with
the
religious
conceptions
of
the
jewish
exiles
must
to
say
the
least
have
produced
an
effect
which
it
is
well
worth
our
while
to
study
hitherto
the
traditional
view
has
been
that
this
effect
exhibited
itself
wholly
on
the
antagonistic
side
the
jews
carried
nothing
away
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
except
an
intense
hatred
of
idolatry
more
especially
babylonian
as
well
as
of
the
beliefs
and
practices
associated
therewith
professor
ignatius
goldziher
of
budapest
has
enlightened
us
in
a
passage
in
his
among
the
as
to
the
great
influence
wielded
by
babylonian
upon
jewish
religion
he
says
the
receptive
tendency
of
the
hebrew
manifested
itself
again
prominently
during
the
babylonian
captivity
here
first
they
gained
an
opportunity
of
forming
for
themselves
a
complete
and
harmonious
conception
of
the
world
the
influence
of
canaanitish
civilization
could
not
then
be
particularly
powerful
on
the
hebrews
for
that
civilization
the
highest
point
of
which
was
attained
by
the
phœnicians
was
quite
dwarfed
by
the
mental
activity
exhibited
in
the
monuments
of
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
empire
which
we
are
now
able
to
admire
in
all
their
grandeur
there
the
hebrews
found
more
to
receive
than
some
few
civil
political
and
religious
institutions
the
extensive
and
manifold
literature
which
they
found
there
could
not
but
act
on
a
receptive
mind
as
a
powerful
stimulus
for
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
the
nation
then
dragged
into
captivity
lived
so
long
in
the
empire
without
gaining
any
knowledge
of
its
intellectual
treasures
latest
publications
on
assyrian
poetry
have
enabled
us
to
establish
a
striking
similarity
between
both
the
course
of
ideas
and
the
poetical
form
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
old
testament
especially
of
the
psalms
and
those
of
this
assyrian
poetry
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
account
for
this
similarity
by
reference
to
a
common
semitic
origin
in
primeval
times
for
we
can
only
resort
to
that
in
cases
which
do
not
go
beyond
the
most
primitive
elements
of
intellectual
life
and
ideas
of
the
world
or
designations
of
things
of
the
external
world
conceptions
of
a
higher
and
more
complicated
kind
as
well
as
æsthetic
points
can
certainly
not
be
carried
off
into
the
mists
of
a
prehistoric
age
it
is
much
better
to
keep
to
more
real
and
tangible
ground
and
to
suppose
those
points
of
contact
between
hebrew
and
assyrian
poetry
which
are
revealed
by
schrader
lenormant
and
george
smith
publications
to
form
part
of
the
contributions
made
by
the
highly
civilized
babylonians
and
assyrians
to
the
hebrews
in
the
course
of
the
important
period
of
the
captivity
we
see
from
this
that
the
intellect
of
babylon
and
assyria
exerted
a
more
than
passing
influence
on
that
of
the
hebrews
not
merely
touching
it
but
entering
deep
into
it
and
leaving
its
own
impress
upon
it
the
assyrian
poetry
of
the
kind
just
mentioned
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
that
of
the
hebrews
as
does
the
plain
narrative
texts
of
the
hebrews
and
as
does
the
sacrificial
tablet
of
marseilles
to
the
hebrews
beginnings
of
a
sacerdotal
constitution
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
influence
is
of
course
much
more
extensive
pregnant
and
noteworthy
the
abbé
loisy
in
a
french
work
myths
babyloniens
et
les
premiers
chapitres
de
la
paris
says
a
few
things
upon
jewish
and
babylonian
mythical
relations
worth
translating
we
can
no
longer
take
the
first
eleven
or
twelve
chapters
of
genesis
as
a
whole
and
treat
them
as
a
monotheistic
redaction
of
the
babylonian
myths
the
biblical
accounts
are
not
mere
transcriptions
and
the
gaps
between
them
presuppose
much
assimilation
and
transformation
much
time
and
probably
many
intermediaries
to
boot
if
the
relationship
of
the
biblical
narratives
to
the
chaldean
legends
is
in
many
respects
less
intimate
than
was
thought
it
now
appears
to
be
more
general
the
creation
and
the
flood
in
particular
are
still
the
most
obvious
points
of
resemblance
but
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
the
earthly
paradise
the
food
of
life
the
explanation
of
death
all
of
which
have
sometimes
been
sought
where
they
were
not
to
be
found
are
now
found
where
there
was
no
thought
of
seeking
them
the
biblical
texts
have
no
literary
dependence
upon
the
babylonian
texts
they
do
not
even
stand
to
them
in
a
relation
of
direct
dependence
in
the
case
of
the
special
traditions
they
exhibit
but
they
rest
on
a
similar
we
might
say
a
common
foundation
of
chaldean
origin
whose
antiquity
can
not
be
even
approximately
estimated
on
the
other
hand
it
appears
certain
that
the
period
of
assyrian
dominance
and
the
captivity
quickened
the
recollection
of
the
old
traditions
and
supplemented
them
by
fresh
materials
easy
to
graft
on
the
ancient
stem
we
may
well
believe
that
the
metamorphosis
was
complete
in
the
oral
tradition
of
the
people
before
the
legend
was
embodied
in
the
biblical
narrative
babylonian
influence
upon
the
other
semites
the
influence
of
the
babylonian
religion
upon
other
semitic
cults
is
worthy
of
notice
although
its
effect
upon
the
jewish
faith
was
more
marked
than
on
any
other
semitic
form
of
belief
yet
still
through
conquest
and
other
causes
it
undoubtedly
exercised
a
strong
influence
upon
the
surrounding
peoples
especially
those
of
related
stock
we
must
regard
the
whole
of
asia
minor
or
at
least
its
most
civilized
portion
as
peopled
by
races
of
diverse
origin
who
yet
possessed
a
general
culture
in
common
some
of
those
races
if
we
be
permitted
to
employ
rather
ethnological
labels
were
like
the
assyrians
and
hebrews
others
were
of
the
or
type
like
the
hittites
whilst
still
others
like
the
philistines
appear
to
have
been
of
race
resembling
the
greeks
and
goths
but
all
these
different
races
had
embraced
a
common
culture
their
architecture
pottery
weapons
crafts
and
laws
seem
to
have
come
from
a
common
source
and
lastly
their
religious
systems
were
markedly
alike
the
canaanites
we
find
a
people
called
the
canaanites
as
the
first
historic
dwellers
in
the
countries
now
known
as
syria
and
palestine
we
do
not
know
whether
the
name
canaan
originated
with
the
land
or
the
race
but
the
name
is
now
used
as
a
general
designation
of
the
inhabitants
of
palestine
these
people
were
probably
neolithic
in
origin
and
appeared
to
have
been
semitic
in
any
case
they
spoke
a
language
very
much
akin
to
hebrew
they
exercised
a
strong
influence
upon
egypt
about
and
thousands
of
them
settled
in
that
country
as
slaves
or
officials
they
invaded
babylonia
at
an
early
date
under
the
name
of
amorites
and
many
of
the
personal
names
of
babylonian
kings
during
the
hammurabi
dynasty
seem
to
be
amorite
in
origin
from
the
egyptian
records
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
as
early
as
they
had
invaded
palestine
had
exterminated
the
inhabitants
and
that
this
invasion
synchronized
with
that
of
babylonia
their
religion
seems
to
have
been
markedly
semitic
in
type
but
of
the
earlier
variety
that
is
animism
was
just
beginning
to
emerge
into
polytheism
the
gods
were
not
called
by
their
personal
names
but
rather
by
their
attributes
the
general
name
for
was
which
was
used
also
by
the
hebrews
and
which
we
find
in
such
names
as
jezebel
elkanah
and
perhaps
in
the
modern
arabic
but
this
word
was
not
employed
by
the
canaanites
in
a
monotheistic
sense
it
was
generic
and
denoted
the
particular
divinity
who
dwelt
in
a
certain
place
it
was
indeed
the
word
a
god
any
god
but
not
god
but
such
a
god
having
a
sanctuary
or
presiding
over
a
community
was
known
as
this
might
apply
to
any
supernatural
being
from
fetish
to
deity
and
only
meant
that
the
spirit
or
divinity
had
established
a
relation
with
a
particular
holy
place
we
also
find
amongst
the
canaanitish
deities
shamash
the
so
widely
worshipped
in
babylonia
sin
the
hadad
or
rimmon
and
uru
god
of
light
whose
name
is
found
in
or
jerusalem
dagon
too
is
held
by
some
authorities
to
have
been
purely
an
amorite
divinity
the
worship
of
animals
was
also
general
and
bulls
horses
and
serpents
were
represented
as
deities
there
were
also
an
immense
number
of
nameless
gods
or
spirits
presiding
over
all
sorts
of
physical
objects
and
these
were
known
as
they
were
the
resultants
of
animistic
ideas
the
early
inhabitants
of
canaan
were
also
like
many
other
primitive
people
and
they
seem
to
have
shown
a
marked
preference
for
the
cult
of
the
dead
but
many
of
their
departmental
deities
were
either
identical
with
or
strongly
resembled
the
gods
of
the
babylonians
ashtart
was
of
course
ishtar
in
the
mounds
of
palestine
large
numbers
of
plaques
bearing
her
effigy
are
found
she
is
often
depicted
on
these
with
a
tall
necklace
anklets
and
girdle
quite
in
the
babylonian
style
but
other
representations
of
her
reveal
egyptian
cypriote
and
hittite
influences
and
this
goes
to
show
that
in
all
probability
the
great
of
babylon
and
asia
minor
was
compounded
of
various
early
types
fused
into
one
to
confine
ourselves
to
those
deities
who
are
more
closely
connected
with
the
babylonian
religion
we
find
the
name
of
ninib
translated
by
the
canaanites
as
and
it
has
been
thought
that
ninib
was
a
god
of
the
west
who
had
migrated
to
babylonia
the
name
of
nebo
the
babylonian
patron
of
borsippa
who
also
acted
as
scribe
to
the
gods
appears
in
that
of
the
town
of
nebo
in
moab
in
judea
and
that
canaanites
were
conversant
with
the
name
of
nergal
the
is
proved
by
a
sealed
cylinder
of
canaanitish
workmanship
which
bears
the
inscription
atanaheli
son
of
habsi
servant
of
nergal
resheph
also
appears
to
have
been
known
to
the
canaanites
illustration
elijah
prevailing
over
the
priests
of
evelyn
paul
the
gods
of
the
phœnicians
the
phœnicians
who
were
the
lineal
descendants
of
the
canaanites
adopted
many
of
the
deities
of
babylonia
like
the
early
deities
of
that
great
empire
the
phœnician
gods
were
associated
either
with
the
earth
the
waters
or
the
air
some
of
these
in
later
times
held
sway
over
more
than
one
element
thus
the
god
melkarth
of
tyre
had
both
a
celestial
and
a
marine
aspect
and
baal
and
ashtart
assumed
celestial
attributes
in
addition
to
their
earthly
one
the
phœnicians
described
their
gods
in
general
as
much
as
the
israelites
in
early
times
must
have
described
theirs
for
we
find
in
the
first
chapters
of
genesis
the
word
employed
both
then
went
back
to
the
singular
form
the
common
semitic
name
for
adding
to
it
the
semitic
plural
ending
the
god
of
a
locality
or
shrine
was
known
as
its
and
as
in
early
times
this
did
not
apply
to
any
particular
deity
although
their
gods
all
had
names
yet
still
they
were
merely
the
of
tyre
the
chief
of
whom
was
melkarth
whose
name
signifies
merely
or
patron
of
the
city
perhaps
one
of
their
most
venerated
gods
was
who
was
also
worshipped
in
carthage
a
phœnician
colony
one
of
the
most
strongly
marked
characteristics
of
the
phœnician
religion
was
the
unvarying
addition
of
a
female
to
every
male
god
ashtart
or
ishtar
was
quite
as
popular
in
modern
phœnicia
as
she
has
been
in
ancient
canaan
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
tyre
and
sidon
were
closely
in
touch
with
assyria
and
that
their
ships
probably
carried
assyrian
commerce
far
and
wide
throughout
the
mediterranean
exchanging
syrian
goods
for
egyptian
cyprian
and
hellenic
ashtart
or
ishtar
had
temples
at
sidon
and
askelon
and
phœnician
mariners
seem
to
have
carried
her
worship
as
far
as
cyprus
and
even
sicily
indeed
it
was
probably
through
their
agency
that
she
was
introduced
into
the
greek
world
but
there
were
greek
colonies
on
the
shores
of
asia
minor
at
an
early
date
and
these
may
have
transferred
her
cult
to
the
people
of
their
own
race
in
the
greek
motherland
another
goddess
specially
honoured
at
carthage
was
tanith
who
was
also
called
the
of
eshmun
the
god
of
vital
force
and
healing
seems
to
have
been
worshipped
especially
at
sidon
but
also
at
carthage
melkarth
the
patron
deity
of
tyre
the
greeks
equated
with
their
heracles
reshef
the
lightning
god
was
of
syrian
origin
and
was
identified
by
the
greeks
with
apollo
the
phœnicians
were
also
prone
to
fuse
their
gods
one
with
another
so
that
we
have
such
combinations
as
and
so
forth
phœnician
religion
was
also
strongly
influenced
by
egyptian
ideas
and
plutarch
has
put
it
on
record
that
when
isis
journeyed
to
byblus
she
was
called
astarte
certain
phœnician
settlers
at
piræus
the
port
of
athens
worshipped
the
assyrian
god
nergal
and
many
of
their
proper
names
are
compounded
of
the
names
of
babylon
deities
the
worship
of
moloch
was
also
popular
in
phœnicia
where
he
was
called
melk
and
to
him
as
to
the
moloch
of
the
other
semitic
peoples
infants
were
offered
up
in
sacrifice
the
phœnicians
likewise
adopted
the
custom
of
burning
the
chief
god
of
the
city
in
effigy
or
in
the
person
of
a
human
representative
at
tyre
and
carthage
see
remarks
on
hamman
pages
and
on
sardanapalus
pages
we
know
very
little
concerning
phœnician
myth
we
can
not
credit
what
is
written
by
philo
of
byblus
concerning
it
as
he
professed
that
he
had
used
as
his
authority
the
writings
of
one
sanchuniathon
an
ancient
phœnician
sage
who
he
says
derived
his
information
from
inscribed
stones
in
phœnician
temples
all
of
philo
that
remains
and
thus
all
of
sanchuniathon
is
preserved
in
the
works
of
eusebius
it
would
seem
however
to
be
unfair
to
regard
eusebius
as
the
inventor
of
sanchuniathon
as
we
have
already
remarked
in
the
paragraphs
dealing
with
the
legend
of
oannes
or
ea
several
of
the
myths
he
quotes
as
coming
from
the
phœnician
sage
are
manifestly
of
babylonian
origin
like
all
semites
the
phœnicians
closely
identified
themselves
with
their
gods
in
whom
if
inscriptions
can
be
believed
they
seemed
to
find
a
great
deal
of
comfort
they
were
assiduous
devotees
of
their
several
cults
and
as
prone
to
sacrifice
as
were
their
cousins
of
babylonia
probably
too
their
voyages
and
mercantile
ventures
made
them
firm
believers
in
the
efficacy
of
divination
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
trade
of
the
seer
in
ancient
tyre
or
sidon
must
have
been
a
flourishing
one
indeed
the
carthaginian
religion
very
little
is
known
concerning
the
religion
of
the
semites
of
carthage
those
colonists
from
phœnicia
who
settled
on
the
shores
of
africa
at
an
early
date
and
this
is
probably
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
the
jealousy
of
their
roman
conquerors
ordained
that
all
records
pertaining
to
them
should
so
far
as
possible
be
blotted
out
in
virgil
we
find
queen
dido
of
carthage
worshipping
and
sacrificing
to
the
gods
of
rome
but
whether
this
error
is
due
to
roman
lack
of
imagination
or
otherwise
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
carthaginian
religion
was
strongly
influenced
by
assyrian
belief
the
chief
gods
worshipped
in
carthage
were
or
moloch
tanit
goddess
of
the
heavens
and
the
moon
ashtart
or
ishtar
and
eshmun
the
patron
deity
of
the
city
the
cult
of
was
also
greatly
in
vogue
as
was
that
of
the
god
patechus
a
repulsive
monster
who
may
have
been
of
egyptian
origin
the
tyrian
melkarth
too
was
widely
worshipped
we
also
encounter
in
inscriptions
the
names
of
deities
concerning
whom
we
know
nothing
such
as
rabbat
umma
great
mother
illat
sakon
and
tsaphon
about
the
beginning
of
the
third
century
the
intimate
relations
between
the
carthaginians
and
the
greeks
of
sicily
favoured
the
introduction
of
a
hellenic
element
into
the
punic
religion
and
there
was
reciprocal
borrowing
on
the
part
of
the
greeks
in
the
forum
of
carthage
was
a
temple
to
apollo
containing
a
colossal
statue
which
was
later
removed
to
rome
and
on
one
occasion
the
carthaginian
worshippers
of
apollo
actually
sent
offerings
to
delphi
we
also
find
their
goddess
tanit
compared
with
the
greek
demeter
her
symbol
is
a
crescent
moon
and
in
her
temple
at
carthage
was
preserved
a
famous
veil
which
was
regarded
as
the
palladium
or
of
the
city
its
inscriptions
to
tanit
and
abound
and
as
these
are
usually
found
in
conjunction
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
these
two
deities
are
worshipped
together
tanit
was
in
fact
frequently
alluded
to
as
countenance
of
baal
whose
name
we
find
in
those
of
the
carthaginian
heroes
hannibal
and
hasdrubal
the
carthaginian
is
represented
as
an
old
man
with
ram
horns
on
his
forehead
and
that
animal
was
frequently
portrayed
along
with
him
he
also
holds
a
scythe
at
carthage
children
were
sacrificed
to
him
and
their
bodies
were
placed
in
the
arms
of
a
colossal
bronze
statue
which
represented
him
when
they
grew
tired
they
slipped
through
the
embrace
of
the
god
into
a
furnace
below
amid
the
excited
cries
of
the
fanatical
worshippers
even
roman
severity
could
not
put
an
end
to
these
horrors
which
persisted
in
secret
until
a
relatively
late
date
it
is
strange
to
think
that
after
the
fall
of
carthage
the
goddess
tanit
became
identified
with
dido
by
the
new
roman
colonists
of
the
city
virgil
had
celebrated
her
misfortunes
and
a
public
dido
cult
grew
up
the
colonists
even
claiming
to
have
discovered
the
very
house
from
which
she
had
watched
the
departure
of
æneas
it
is
not
unlikely
that
through
the
agency
of
the
phœnicians
some
fragments
of
the
babylonian
religion
may
have
penetrated
even
to
our
own
shores
we
know
that
they
traded
for
tin
with
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
cornwall
and
the
scilly
isles
and
some
writers
believe
they
have
philology
on
their
side
when
they
try
to
show
that
several
cornish
names
are
of
phœnician
origin
for
example
the
name
marazion
appears
to
mean
in
semitic
by
the
sea
and
polgarth
say
some
owes
its
second
syllable
to
the
phœnician
word
for
but
it
will
not
do
to
be
dogmatic
regarding
these
names
which
may
after
all
be
explicable
from
cornish
or
other
sources
we
see
then
that
the
semitic
religion
travelled
over
a
considerably
wide
area
that
beginning
in
all
probability
in
arabia
it
spread
itself
through
mesopotamia
northward
as
far
as
lake
van
and
southward
through
the
sinaitic
peninsula
into
egypt
and
the
north
of
africa
it
is
strange
to
observe
that
the
later
semitic
religion
of
mohammed
followed
almost
precisely
the
same
course
and
that
its
early
progress
westward
halted
almost
on
the
very
site
of
ancient
carthage
that
when
it
overflowed
into
spain
its
disciples
were
acting
precisely
as
carthaginian
hannibal
had
done
long
before
and
that
it
was
beaten
back
by
european
effort
in
almost
exactly
the
same
way
robertson
smith
in
his
valuable
work
religion
of
the
mentions
that
in
his
view
semitic
religion
does
not
differ
so
fundamentally
from
the
other
types
of
world
religion
as
many
writers
on
the
subject
appear
to
think
but
the
longer
one
considers
it
the
greater
do
the
barriers
between
semitic
and
other
religions
appear
and
the
more
clearly
marked
their
lines
of
demarcation
the
prolonged
isolation
to
which
the
semitic
peoples
seem
to
have
been
subjected
appears
to
have
greatly
affected
their
manner
of
religious
thought
they
are
in
truth
a
people
practical
yet
mystical
strongly
of
the
world
yet
finding
their
chief
solace
in
those
things
which
are
not
of
the
world
the
materials
for
a
complete
inquiry
into
the
history
of
semitic
religion
are
lacking
and
we
must
perforce
fill
up
the
gaps
which
are
many
by
comparative
methods
but
in
this
we
are
greatly
assisted
by
the
numerous
manifestations
of
semitic
faith
which
including
as
it
does
babylonian
assyrian
canaanitish
phœnician
arabian
and
mohammedan
cults
provides
us
with
rich
comparative
material
the
religion
of
zoroaster
the
faith
which
immediately
supplanted
that
of
ancient
babylonia
and
assyria
could
not
fail
to
draw
considerably
from
it
this
was
the
zoroastrian
faith
the
religion
of
the
persians
introduced
by
the
reformer
zarathustra
the
earliest
form
of
zoroaster
name
as
given
in
the
uncertainty
hangs
over
the
date
and
place
of
his
birth
the
greeks
spoke
of
him
as
belonging
to
a
remote
age
but
modern
scholars
assign
the
period
of
his
life
to
the
latter
half
of
the
seventh
and
early
sixth
century
it
seems
certain
that
he
was
not
a
persian
but
a
mede
or
a
bactrian
either
supposition
being
supported
by
indications
of
one
kind
or
another
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
gathas
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
we
are
led
says
haug
their
translator
to
feel
that
he
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
stamp
acting
a
grand
part
on
the
stage
of
his
country
history
zarathustra
speaks
of
himself
as
a
messenger
from
god
sent
to
bring
the
people
the
blessing
of
civilization
and
to
destroy
idolatry
many
legends
grew
up
around
his
memory
of
miraculous
signs
at
his
birth
of
his
precocious
wisdom
whereby
even
as
a
child
he
confounded
the
magi
of
his
being
borne
up
to
the
highest
heaven
and
there
receiving
the
word
of
life
from
deity
itself
together
with
the
revelation
of
all
secrets
of
the
future
he
retired
as
a
young
man
from
the
world
to
spend
long
years
of
contemplation
before
he
began
his
teaching
at
thirty
and
he
lived
to
the
age
of
the
religion
he
taught
was
the
national
religion
of
the
persians
from
the
time
of
the
achæmenidæ
who
dethroned
cyaxares
son
to
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
it
declined
after
alexander
conquest
under
the
seleucidæ
and
the
succeeding
dynasty
of
the
arsacidæ
but
was
revived
by
the
sassanian
rulers
and
flourished
for
the
four
centuries
then
followed
the
mohammedan
conquest
accompanied
by
persecution
before
which
the
faithful
followers
of
zarathustra
fled
to
india
where
they
are
now
represented
by
their
descendants
the
parsis
of
bombay
the
religious
belief
taught
by
zarathustra
is
based
on
the
dual
conception
of
a
good
principle
ahura
mazda
and
an
evil
principle
anra
mainyu
and
the
leading
idea
of
his
teaching
is
the
constant
conflict
between
the
two
which
must
continue
until
the
end
of
the
period
ordained
by
ahura
mazda
for
the
duration
of
the
world
when
evil
will
be
finally
overcome
until
then
the
god
power
is
to
some
degree
limited
as
evil
still
withstands
him
doctrine
was
essentially
practical
and
ethical
it
was
not
in
abstract
contemplation
or
in
separation
from
the
world
that
man
was
to
look
for
spiritual
deliverance
but
in
active
charity
in
deeds
of
usefulness
in
kindness
to
animals
in
everything
that
could
help
to
make
the
world
a
place
to
live
in
in
courage
and
all
uprightness
to
build
a
bridge
or
dig
a
canal
was
to
help
to
lessen
the
power
of
evil
as
reinach
has
concisely
expressed
it
a
life
thoroughly
occupied
was
a
perpetual
exorcism
the
two
figures
of
ahura
mazda
and
anra
mainyu
the
one
with
his
attendant
archangels
and
angels
and
the
other
with
his
and
demons
or
divs
compose
the
zarathustrian
celestial
hierarchy
as
represented
in
the
earlier
sacred
writings
in
the
later
ones
other
figures
are
introduced
into
the
pantheon
the
sacred
writings
that
have
been
preserved
are
of
different
periods
and
outside
the
range
of
zarathustra
moral
system
of
religion
there
are
traces
in
them
of
revivals
of
an
older
primitive
nature
worship
and
of
the
beliefs
of
an
early
nomadic
shepherd
life
as
for
instance
the
sacredness
in
which
cow
and
dog
are
held
as
well
as
reminiscences
of
general
myths
ahura
mazda
was
the
creator
of
the
universe
for
the
duration
of
which
he
fixed
a
certain
term
it
seems
uncertain
whether
the
persians
pictured
the
world
as
round
or
flat
but
according
to
their
idea
it
was
divided
into
seven
zones
of
which
the
central
one
was
the
actual
habitable
earth
between
these
zones
and
enveloping
the
whole
was
the
great
abyss
of
waters
between
earth
and
heaven
rose
the
celestial
mountain
whence
all
the
rivers
upon
earth
had
their
source
and
on
which
was
deposited
the
haoma
the
central
feature
of
zoroastrian
ritual
was
the
worship
of
fire
an
worship
which
had
existed
before
zoroaster
time
in
the
oldest
period
images
were
forbidden
and
holy
rites
could
be
performed
without
temples
portable
being
in
use
temples
were
however
built
in
quite
early
times
and
within
these
was
the
sanctuary
from
which
all
light
was
excluded
and
where
the
sacred
fire
was
kept
alight
which
could
only
be
approached
by
the
priest
with
covered
hands
and
mouth
the
persians
carried
the
fear
of
defilement
to
an
extreme
and
had
even
more
elaborate
regulations
than
most
easterns
concerning
methods
of
purification
and
avoidance
of
defilement
both
as
regards
personal
contamination
or
that
of
the
sacred
elements
of
earth
fire
and
water
even
hair
and
nails
could
not
be
cut
without
special
directions
as
to
how
to
deal
with
the
separated
portions
but
this
perpetual
and
exhausting
state
of
caution
and
protective
effort
against
contact
with
defiling
objects
and
rigorous
system
of
purification
had
an
ultimate
concern
with
the
great
struggle
going
on
between
good
and
evil
death
and
everything
that
partook
of
death
or
had
any
power
of
injury
were
works
of
the
it
was
owing
to
the
fear
of
contaminating
the
three
elements
named
above
that
the
persians
neither
buried
nor
cremated
their
dead
and
looked
upon
it
as
a
criminal
act
to
throw
a
corpse
into
the
water
the
old
mode
of
disposing
of
the
dead
was
similar
to
that
now
practised
by
the
parsis
of
bombay
who
carry
the
body
to
one
of
the
towers
of
silence
so
the
persians
exposed
the
corpse
till
one
or
other
devouring
agent
birds
of
prey
or
the
elements
had
reduced
it
to
a
skeleton
as
regards
man
himself
he
was
thought
to
be
a
reasonable
being
of
free
will
with
conscience

and
a

or
prototype
of
himself
who
dwelt
above
called

own
character
indeed
put
into
a
spiritual
body
almost
identical
with
the
or
spiritual
nymphs
of
the
araucanian
indians
of
chile
he
had
the
choice
of
good
and
evil
and
consequently
suffered
the
due
punishment
of
sin
for
the
first
three
days
after
death
the
soul
of
the
dead
was
supposed
to
hover
about
its
earthly
abode
during
this
time
friends
and
relatives
performed
their
funerary
rites
their
prayers
and
offerings
becoming
more
earnest
and
abundant
as
the
hour
drew
nigh
when
the
soul
was
bound
to
start
on
its
journey
to
the
beyond
this
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
day
when
sraosha
carried
it
aloft
assailed
on
the
way
by
demons
desirous
of
obtaining
possession
of
his
burden
on
earth
everything
was
being
done
to
keep
the
evil
spirits
in
check
fires
lighted
as
particularly
effective
against
the
powers
of
darkness
and
thus
assisted
sraosha
arrived
safely
with
his
charge
at
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
space
between
earth
and
heaven
here
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
the
soul
account
was
cast
up
by
mithra
and
rashnu
the
latter
weighed
its
good
and
evil
deeds
and
even
if
the
good
deeds
turned
the
scale
the
soul
had
still
to
undergo
immediate
penance
for
its
transgression
so
strict
was
the
justice
meted
out
to
each
now
the
bridge
may
be
crossed
and
a
further
automatic
kind
of
verdict
is
given
for
to
those
fit
for
heaven
the
bridge
appears
a
wide
and
easy
way
to
the
unfortunate
ones
doomed
to
destruction
it
seems
but
of
a
breadth
and
stepping
on
to
it
they
straightway
fall
into
the
yawning
gulf
beneath
the
blessed
ones
are
met
at
heaven
gate
by
a
radiant
figure
who
leads
them
through
the
that
finally
open
into
the
everlasting
light
of
the
celestial
abode
this
is
the
triumph
of
the
individual
soul
but
there
is
divine
event
awaiting
which
will
be
heralded
by
signs
and
wonders
for
years
previous
to
it
there
are
alternate
intervals
of
overpowering
evil
and
conquering
peace
at
last
the
great
dragon
is
let
loose
and
the
evil
time
comes
but
mazda
sends
a
man
to
slay
it
then
the
saviour
saoshyant
is
born
of
a
virgin
the
dead
arise
the
sheep
and
goats
are
divided
and
there
is
lamentation
on
the
earth
the
mountains
dissolve
and
flood
the
earth
with
molten
metal
a
devouring
agent
of
destruction
to
the
wicked
but
from
which
the
good
take
no
hurt
the
spiritual
powers
have
now
to
battle
it
out
mazda
and
sraosha
overcome
ahriman
and
the
dragon
and
then
age
decay
and
death
are
done
away
and
in
their
place
are
everlasting
growth
and
life
babylonian
ethics
and
lastly
what
of
the
ethics
of
ancient
babylon
and
assyria
on
the
whole
the
moral
standard
of
these
countries
was
not
by
any
means
so
exalted
as
our
own
although
the
religious
outlook
was
not
a
low
one
to
begin
with
the
character
of
babylonian
myth
was
a
great
deal
purer
than
that
of
hellenic
or
scandinavian
myth
the
gods
of
babylonia
appear
to
be
more
dignified
than
those
of
the
greeks
or
norsemen
for
example
they
do
not
descend
to
the
same
puerilities
and
their
record
is
immeasurably
cleaner
this
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
very
great
body
of
ritual
connected
with
the
babylonian
religion
for
when
a
people
is
so
hedged
in
by
religious
custom
as
were
the
ancient
chaldeans
so
threatened
on
every
side
by
taboo
the
mere
thought
of
wrongdoing
and
the
consequence
thereof
is
sufficient
to
deter
them
from
acting
otherwise
than
reasonably
in
course
of
time
sin
becomes
so
ugly
and
repulsive
in
the
light
of
punishment
that
the
moral
code
receives
a
tremendous
impulse
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
babylonians
devoutly
believed
that
their
gods
demanded
rigid
adherence
to
the
moral
code
it
was
generally
thought
that
misfortune
and
illness
were
the
consequences
of
moral
transgression
but
the
babylonians
did
not
believe
that
the
cardinal
sins
alone
were
heinous
for
they
included
in
transgression
such
misdemeanours
as
maliciousness
fraud
unworthy
ambitions
and
injurious
teaching

modern
excavation
in
babylonia
and
assyria
in
no
land
has
excavation
assisted
history
so
greatly
as
in
mesopotamia
in
egypt
although
has
widened
our
knowledge
of
life
and
religion
in
the
nile
country
most
of
what
we
know
of
these
subjects
has
been
gleaned
from
temples
and
pyramids
and
mastabas
for
the
proper
examination
of
which
little
or
no
digging
was
necessary
and
generally
speaking
it
may
be
said
that
excavation
in
egypt
has
furnished
us
with
a
greater
insight
into
the
earlier
periods
of
egyptian
progress
its
life
but
in
the
region
practically
every
discovery
has
been
due
to
strenuous
labour
with
pick
and
spade
our
knowledge
of
chaldea
in
its
has
literally
been
dug
up
piece
by
piece
the
honour
of
beginning
the
great
task
of
unearthing
the
buried
cities
of
mesopotamia
belongs
to
botta
who
was
french
consul
at
mosul
in
moved
by
the
belief
that
many
of
the
great
mounds
which
are
so
conspicuous
a
feature
of
the
mesopotamian
landscape
probably
concealed
ruins
of
a
vanished
civilization
botta
commenced
to
excavate
the
large
mound
of
kouyunjik
which
is
situated
close
to
the
village
where
he
resided
but
he
found
little
to
reward
his
labours
and
he
does
not
seem
to
have
gone
about
the
business
of
excavation
in
a
very
workmanlike
manner
his
attention
was
called
by
an
intelligent
native
to
the
mounds
of
khorsabad
the
site
of
ancient
nineveh
and
he
dispatched
a
party
of
workmen
to
the
spot
soon
his
perseverance
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
some
sculptures
and
recognizing
the
superior
importance
of
khorsabad
for
archæological
purposes
he
transferred
his
establishment
to
that
village
and
resolved
to
devote
himself
to
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
site
soon
a
sinking
operation
came
upon
one
of
the
palace
walls
and
subsequent
digging
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
many
chambers
and
halls
faced
with
slabs
of
gypsum
covered
with
mythological
figures
battle
scenes
processions
and
similar
subjects
he
had
in
fact
unearthed
a
palace
built
at
nineveh
by
sargon
king
of
assyria
who
reigned
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
assyrian
palatial
architecture
he
continued
his
excavations
at
khorsabad
until
and
was
successful
in
bringing
to
light
a
temple
and
a
grand
porch
decorated
by
three
pairs
of
wings
under
which
passed
the
road
from
the
city
to
the
palace
many
of
the
fruits
of
his
labours
were
removed
to
paris
and
deposited
in
the
louvre
his
successor
victor

continued

sir

had
visited

was
greatly
impressed
by
botta
work
and
its
results
five
years
later
through
the
assistance
of
sir
stratford
canning
he
was
enabled
himself
to
commence
excavations
at
nimrûd
he
soon
unearthed
the
remains
of
extensive
buildings
in
fact
he
discovered
two
assyrian
palaces
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
excavations
at
the
outset
he
had
only
eleven
men
in
his
employ
and
being
anxious
to
push
on
the
work
in
fear
that
the
local
turkish
governor
or
the
approach
of
the
winter
season
would
put
an
end
to
his
operations
he
increased
his
staff
to
thirty
men
the
peasants
laboured
enthusiastically
but
to
the
excavator
disgust
the
turkish
authorities
forbade
him
to
proceed

nevertheless
hoodwinked
the
authorities
and
succeeded
in
uncovering

quickly
crowned
by
success
for
he
came
upon
a
large
hall
in
a
fine
state
of
preservation
the
serious
work
of
excavation
was
not
without
its
humorous
side

chanced
to
unearth
a
carven
monster
with
the
body
of
a
bull
and
the
head

now
unearthed

sent
a
small

the
to

but
it
was
found
impossible
to
ship
the
massive
pieces
on
this
frail
craft

even
the
smaller
sculptures
had
perforce
to
be
floated
down

layard
health
was
by
this
time
in
no
very
robust
state
but
a
two
months
mountain
holiday
in
kurdistan
refreshed
him
and
once
more
he
recommenced
his
labours
at
nimrûd
heartened
by
the
news
that
the
british
government
had
awarded
a
grant
for
the
continuation
of
his
researches
the
grant
however
was
distressingly
small
and
its
inadequacy
compelled
him
to
limit
his
excavations
in
the
most
unsatisfactory
way
despite
this
the
new
operations
were
rich
in
results
especially
those
in
the
building
known
as
the

this
palace

ascertained
from
bricks
unearthed
had
been
built
by
king
of
assyria
sculptures
glorifying
king
were
also
discovered
at
the
palace
some
of
them
of
a
most
spirited
character
representing
the
king
in
battle
crossing
a
river
full
of
turtles
and

or
leading
his

it
was
in
the
central
building
however
that
one
of
his
most
important
discoveries
awaited
him
this
was
the
obelisk
of
shalmaneser

nearly
seven
feet
high
and
in
admirable
preservation
the
monarch
had
erected
this

to

and
of
these
he
succeeded
in
sending
three
by

whence
they
were
later
shipped
to

by
the
middle
of
may
he
had
finished
his
work
at
nimrûd
and
had
commenced
his
search
for
the
ruins
of
nineveh
in
the
mound
of
kouyunjik
near
mosul
where
botta
had
laboured
before
him
he
dug
for
the
platform
of
bricks
which
he
knew
by
experience
formed
the
foundation
of
all
large
assyrian
edifices
and
came
upon
it
as
he
had
expected
at
a
depth
of
twenty
feet
shortly
afterward
discovering
the
entrance
flanked
by
the
inevitable
winged
bulls
but
the
building
itself
had
been
so
damaged

layard
returned
to
england
in
june
and
was
appointed
attaché
to
the
embassy
at
constantinople
meanwhile
his
published
works
had
created
an
extraordinary
impression
throughout
europe
and
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
so
wrought
upon
the
government
that
he
was
requested
to
lead
a
second
expedition
to
nineveh
where
rawlinson
slept
better
equipped
layard
left
constantinople
in
august
and
arrived
at
kouyunjik
in
october
employing
about
a
hundred
men
he
set
strenuously
to
work
removing
only
as
much
earth
as
was
necessary
to
show
the
sculptured
walls
having
fairly
started
the
work
at
kouyunjik
layard
accompanied
by
rassam
returned
to
nimrûd
and
recommenced
work
there
one
morning
he
was
inspecting
the
trenches
when
he
found
rawlinson
asleep
on
the
floor
of
an
excavated
chamber
wrapped
in
his
travelling
cloak
wearied
out
by
a
long
and
harassing
night
ride
he
was
on
his
way
home
to

which
he
had
not
seen
for
years

we
are
introduced

shows
us
the

us
into

endeavouring
even
to
convey
the
idea
of

the
excavation
of

with
its
seventy
rooms
halls
and
galleries
was
indeed
one
of
the
most
striking
results
of
second
expedition
to
nineveh
but
even
more
remarkable
was
the
find
of
famous
royal

at

which
has
already
been

results
at

too
had
been
favourable

now
for

layard
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
overwork
and
exposure
and
in
april
accompanied
by
rassam
he
turned
from
the
ruins
of

with
a
heavy
heart
years
later
he
was
to

george
smith
one
who
was
to
perform
yeoman
service
for
assyriology
now
entered
the
field
this
was
george
smith
whose
name
is
so
unalterably
associated
with
the
romantic
side
of
that
science
he
loved
so
well
writing
of
himself
he
says
everyone
has
some
bent
or
inclination
which
if
fostered
by
favourable
circumstances
will
colour
the
rest
of
his
life
my
own
taste
has
always
been
for
oriental
studies
and
from
my
youth
i
have
taken
a
great
interest
in
eastern
explorations
and
discoveries
particularly
in
the
great
work
in
which
layard
and
rawlinson
were
engaged
for
some
years
i
did
little
or
nothing
but
in
seeing
the
unsatisfactory
state
of
our
knowledge
of
those
parts
of
assyrian
history
which
bore
upon
the
history
of
the
bible
i
felt
anxious
to
do
something
towards
settling
the
questions
involved
smith
found
the
deluge
tablets
among
the
scores
of
fragments
sent
to
the
british
museum
by
layard
and
loftus
and
this
and
other
discoveries
whetted
his
desire
to
go
to
mesopotamia
and
unearth
its
treasures
with
his
own
hands
in
consequence
of
the
wide
interest
taken
at
the
time
in
these
discoveries
the
proprietors
of
daily
came
forward
with
the
offer
of
a
thousand
guineas
for
fresh
researches
at
nineveh
with
the
proviso
that
smith
should
head
the
expedition
and
supply
the
journal
with
accounts
of
his
discoveries
the
offer
was
accepted
and
smith
now
a
member
of
the
staff
of
the
british
museum
received
leave
of
absence
for
six
months
arrived
at
nimrûd
smith
settled
down
to
excavation
there
commencing
operations
at
the
temple
of
nebo
but
he
found
little
to
justify
his
labour
as
the
structure
was
in
a
ruinous
condition
and
had
latterly
been
used
as
a
granary
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
stood
a
colossal
figure
of
the
god
with
crossed
arms
in
an
attitude
of
meditation
and
lesser
images
of
him
were
found
inside
the
ruined
building
smith
reason
for
digging
here
was
that
he
suspected
the
presence
of
inscriptions
which
might
cast
light
upon
the
reign
of
ii
and
therefore
upon
bible
history
his
industry
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
the
upper
portion
of
a
tablet
of
this
monarch
but
further
finds
of
importance
were
not
forthcoming

for
sir
henry
layard
the
palace
of
nimrûd
smith
then
instituted
systematic
excavations
in
the
palace
and
made
some
interesting
discoveries
on
examining
this
part
of
the
mound
he
saw
a
considerable
tunnel
in
the
south
face
commencing
on
the
sloping
part
of
the
mound
this
tunnel
appeared
to
go
along
the
middle
of
a
chamber
the
floor
having
been
cut
through
and
appearing
in
a
line
on
each
side
of
the
tunnel
further
on
the
tunnel
reached
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
chamber
and
the
face
of
this
had
been
cleared
for
some
little
distance
then
descending
below
the
foundation
of
this
wall
the
passage
ran
for
some
distance
into
the
base
of
the
mound
he
commenced
on
the
two
sides
of
this
cutting
and
cleared
away
to
the
level
of
the
pavement
soon
coming
to
the
wall
on
each
side
the
southern
wall
of
the
chamber
had
fallen
over
into
the
plain
as
it
was
here
close
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
the
chamber
commenced
with
two
parallel
walls
running
north
and
south
the
wall
in
a
place
near
the
edge
where
it
was
much
broken
down
showed
three
steps
of
an
ascent
which
had
gone
apparently
to
some
upper
chambers
further
on
it
showed
two
recesses
each
ornamented
on
both
sides
with
three
square
pilasters
the
left
hand
showed
an
entrance
into
a
second
chamber
running
east
to
west
and
from
this
turned
a
third
running
parallel
with
the
first
altogether
in
this
place
he
opened
six
chambers
all
of
the
same
character
the
entrances
ornamented
by
clusters
of
square
pilasters
and
recesses
in
the
rooms
in
the
same
style
the
walls
were
coloured
in
horizontal
bands
of
red
green
and
yellow
on
plaster
and
where
the
lower
parts
of
the
chambers
were
panelled
with
small
stone
slabs
the
plaster
and
colours
were
continued
over
these
in
one
of
these
rooms
there
appeared
a
brick
receptacle
let
into
the
floor
and
on
lifting
the
brick
which
covered
this
smith
found
six
winged
figures
closely
packed
in
the
receptacle
each
figure
was
having
a
head
like
a
lion
four
wings
with
one
hand
across
the
breast
holding
a
basket
in
the
other
and
clothed
in
a
long
dress
to
the
feet
these
figures
were
probably
intended
to
preserve
the
building
against
the
power
of
evil
spirits
all
the
eastern
and
southern
portions
of
the
mound
of
nimrûd
had
been
destroyed
by
being
turned
into
a
the
ruins
had
been
excavated
after
the
fall
of
the
assyrian
empire
walls
had
been
dug
through
and
chambers
broken
into
and
the
openings
filled
with
coffins
mr
smith
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
ruins
of
nineveh
at
kouyunjik
and
nebbi
yunas
layard
and
even
the
turkish
government
had
both
been
before
him
here
he
commenced
operations
by
cutting
trenches
at
the
corner
of
palace
but
at
first
nothing
of
great
interest
resulted
and
he
diverted
operations
to
the
palace
of
sennacherib
hard
by
here
he
came
upon
a
number
of
inscriptions
which
compensated
him
for
his
labour
at
length
the
excavations
in
palace
bore
fruit
for
there
were
unearthed
the
greater
portion
of
seventeen
lines
of
inscription
belonging
to
the
first
column
of
the
deluge
narrative
and
fitting
into
the
only
place
where
there
was
a
serious
blank
in
the
story
the
palace
of
sennacherib
also
steadily
produced
its
tribute
of
objects
including
a
small
tablet
of
king
of
assyria
some
new
fragments
of
one
of
the
historical
cylinders
of
and
a
curious
fragment
of
the
history
of
sargon
king
of
assyria
relating
to
his
expedition
against
ashdod
which
is
mentioned
in
the
twentieth
chapter
of
the
book
of
isaiah
on
the
same
fragment
was
also
part
of
the
list
of
median
chiefs
who
paid
tribute
to
sargon
the
proprietors
of
daily
considered
that
with
the
finding
of
the
deluge
fragment
the
purpose
of
the
expedition
had
been
served
and
that
further
excavation
in
mesopotamia
should
be
carried
on
under
national
auspices
mr
smith
was
therefore
forced
to
return
to
england
but
not
before
he
had
discovered
further
a
valuable
syllabary
and
two
portions
of
the
sixth
tablet
of
the
deluge
story
as
well
as
other
minor
objects
of
interest
about
the
end
of
however
the
british
museum
authorities
dispatched
mr
smith
once
more
to
mesopotamia
where
he
recommenced
operations
at
kouyunjik
and
unearthed
on
this
occasion
an
inscription
of
shalmaneser
i
king
of
assyria
recording
that
he
founded
the
palace
of
nineveh
and
alluding
to
his
restoration
of
the
temple
of
ishtar
inscriptions
of
his
son
were
also
found
at
this
place
as
were
dedications
of
and
shalmaneser
ii
some
very
curious
pottery
too
came
from
this
spot
ornamentations
being
laid
on
the
clay
as
in
many
examples
of
the
pottery
of
the
maya
of
central
america
at
the
same
time
fragments
of
sculptured
walls
representing
marching
warriors
were
brought
to
light
and
some
tablets
of
great
importance
giving
the
names
of
six
new
babylonian
kings
a
sixth
tablet
of
the
deluge
series
and
a
bilingual
tablet
in
fine
preservation
in
the
palace
smith
excavated
at
the
grand
entrance
to
see
if
any
records
remained
under
the
pavement
but
there
were
none
this
part
of
the
pavement
had
been
broken
through
and
anything
under
it
had
long
ago
been
carried
away
he
sank
some
trenches
in
the
grand
hall
and
found
a
fragment
of
inscription
and
further
on
in
the
palace
several
other
fragments
his
principal
excavation
was
however
carried
on
over
what
layard
called
the
library
chamber
of
this
palace
layard
who
discovered
the
library
chamber
describes
it
as
full
of
fragments
of
tablets
up
to
a
foot
or
more
from
the
floor
this
chamber
layard
had
cleared
out
and
he
had
brought
its
treasures
to
england
but
smith
thought
on
examining
the
collection
at
the
british
museum
that
not
of
the
library
had
been
removed
and
steadily
adhered
to
the
belief
that
the
rest
of
the
tablets
must
be
in
the
palace
of
sennacherib
on
excavating
he
found
nearly
three
thousand
fragments
of
tablets
in
the
chambers
round
layard
library
chamber
and
from
the
position
of
these
fragments
he
was
led
to
the
opinion
that
the
library
was
not
originally
situated
in
these
chambers
but
in
an
upper
story
of
the
palace
and
that
on
the
collapse
of
the
building
they
fell
into
the
chambers
below
some
of
the
chambers
in
which
he
found
inscribed
tablets
had
no
communication
with
each
other
while
fragments
of
the
same
tablets
were
in
them
and
looking
at
this
fact
and
the
positions
and
distribution
of
the
fragments
he
was
convinced
that
the
tablets
were
scattered
over
a
wide
area
and
resolved
to
excavate
over
an
extensive
section
of
the
palace
in
the
long
gallery
which
contained
scenes
representing
the
moving
of
winged
figures
says
smith
i
found
a
great
number
of
tablets
mostly
along
the
floor
they
included
syllabaries
bilingual
lists
mythological
and
historical
tablets
among
these
tablets
i
discovered
a
beautiful
bronze
assyrian
fork
having
two
prongs
joined
by
ornamental
shoulder
to
shaft
of
spiral
work
the
shaft
ending
in
the
head
of
an
ass
this
is
a
beautiful
and
unique
specimen
of
assyrian
work
and
shows
the
advances
the
people
had
made
in
the
refinements
of
life
south
of
this
there
were
numerous
tablets
round
layard
old
library
chamber
and
here
i
found
part
of
a
curious
astrolabe
and
fragments
of
the
history
of
sargon
king
of
assyria
in
one
place
below
the
level
of
the
floor
i
discovered
a
fine
fragment
of
the
history
of
assurbanipal
containing
new
and
curious
matter
relating
to
his
egyptian
wars
and
to
the
affairs
of
gyges
king
of
lydia
from
this
part
of
the
palace
i
gained
also
the
shoulder
of
a
colossal
statue
with
an
inscription
of
assurbanipal
in
another
spot
i
obtained
a
bone
spoon
and
a
fragment
of
the
tablet
with
the
history
of
the
seven
evil
spirits
near
this
i
discovered
a
bronze
style
with
which
i
believe
the
cuneiform
tablets
were
impressed
in
another
part
of
the
excavation
i
found
part
of
a
monument
with
the
representation
of
a
fortification
in
the
western
part
of
the
palace
near
the
edge
of
the
mound
i
excavated
and
found
remains
of
crystal
and
alabaster
vases
and
specimens
of
the
royal
seal
two
of
these
are
very
curious
one
is
a
paste
seal
the
earliest
example
of
its
kind
and
the
other
is
a
clay
impression
of
the
seal
of
sargon
king
of
assyria
near
where
the
principal
seals
were
discovered
i
found
part
of
a
sculpture
with
a
good
figure
of
a
dead
buffalo
in
a
stream
among
these
sculptures
and
inscriptions
were
numerous
small
objects
including
beads
rings
stone

no

immense
sums
to

soon
afterward
the

the
universal
regret

of
those

were

had
perused
his
works

strenuous
life

the
lamented
death
of

caused
the
british
authorities
to
request
mr
hormuzd
rassam
who
had
retired
into
private
life
in
england
to
take
up
the
vacant
post
mr
rassam
at
once
accepted
the
trust
and
started
for
constantinople
in
november
at
first
there
was
serious
trouble
with
the
turkish
government
but
in
january
rassam
was
enabled
to
commence
excavations
which
he
carried
on
almost
continuously
for
five
years
layard
as
ambassador
at
constantinople
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
took
much
advantage
of
native
talent
which
if
not
up
to
the
standard
of
european
efficiency
he
found
in
no
wise
despicable
but
too
many
excavations
were
being
carried
on
at
one
and
the

time
again
rassam
was
prone
to
attempt
sensational
finds
rather
than
to
keep
steadily
at
the
more
solid
and
less
showy
work
of
excavation
guided
by
certain
indications
of
the
presence
of
objects
of
the
shalmaneser
period
at
kouyunjik
he
dug
there
once

and
succeeded
in
unearthing
the
bronze
plaques
which
had
covered
the
cedar
gates
of
a
large
assyrian
building
at
least
years
old

built
by

represented

also
recovered
further
clay

from

of
at

with
his
return

may
be
said
that

the

had
been

in
babylonian
archæology
in
america
almost
from
the
inception
of
the
series
of
excavations
dealt
with
in
this
sketch
and
this
was
in
all
likelihood
due
to
the
popularity
of
biblical
studies
in
the
great
republic
of
the
west
the
babylonian
exploration
fund
was
instituted
on
november
excavatory
labours
were
commenced
at

in
and
on
first
beholding
the
immense
mass
of
the
mounds
which
concealed
the
ruins
of
the
the
members
of
the

were
not
a
little
disturbed
even
at
a
distance
i
began
to
realize
that
not
twenty
not
fifty
years
would
suffice
to
excavate
this
important
site
thoroughly
writes
professor
hilprecht
the
ruins
resembled
a
picturesque
mountain
range
rather
than
the
last
impressive
remains
of
human
constructions
but
the
americans
down
before
the
mass
with
the
courage
of
their
race
resolved
to
probe
into
its
innermost
secrets
at
first
they
speculated
as
to
the
character
of
the
buildings
hidden
from
their
view
the
director
dr
peters
was
rapidly
exhausting
his
fund
of
without
coming
upon
anything
of
value
and
recognizing
the
necessity
for
the
prompt
discovery
of
important
objects
if
opinion
at
home
was
to
be
placated
hilprecht
pointed
out
to
him
the
desirability
of
attacking
an
isolated
mound
which
in
his
judgment
contained
the
residences
of
the
priests
and
the
temple
library
peters
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
almost
at
once
an
important
series
of
tablets
was
discovered
the
mound
seemed
indeed
inexhaustible
and
most
of
its
contents
were
of
a
date
about
but
there
were
also
later
tablets
belonging
to
the
reign
of
nabopolasser
nebuchadrezzar
nabonidus
and
even
cyrus
cambyses
and
darius

decided

hilprecht
and

the
expert
assyriologists
who
had
been
dispatched
to
advise
him
professionally
himself
not
an
assyriologist
he
laboured
at
a
disadvantage
without
the
assistance
of
these
experts
the
work
of
the
first
expedition
had
concentrated
at
three
conspicuous
points
the
temple
the
hill
which
had
yielded
such
good
results
and
the
of
columns
the
principal
objective
was
now
the
conical
hill
of
containing
the
zikkurat
and
temple
of
bel
peters
regarded
the
temple
as
having
been
built
by
a
king
not
far
removed
from
nebuchadrezzar
in
time
but
many
of
his
inferences
have
been
traversed
by
hilprecht
in
his
endeavour
to
reach
the
older
remains
before
the
more
recent
strata
had
been
investigated
in
the
least
adequately
peters
broke
through
the
outer
casing
of
the
zikkurat
built
of
blocks
of
adobe
in
a
cavity
of
which
he
discovered
a
goose
egg
and
perceived
that
there
was
an
older
of
quite
a
different
form
and
much
smaller
dimensions
enclosed
within
the
other
by
means
of
a
diagonal
trench
cut
through
its
centre
he
ascertained
its
height
and
characteristic
features
down
to
the
level
of
and
came
to
the
conclusion
which
however
did
not
prove
correct
that
the
zikkurat
of
this
ancient
monarch
was
the
earliest
erected
at
nippur
and
similar
shafts
were
sunk
at
other
points
of
the
temple
especially
at
the
northern
and
western
corners
where
he
reached
original
constructions
of
ashurbanapal
and
about
and
discovered
scattered
bricks
that
many
kings
of
many
ages
had
honoured
the
temple
of
bel
at
nippur
the
business
quarter
of
nippur
the
excavators
soon
concluded
that
they
had
hit
upon
the
business
quarter
of
nippur
basing
their
belief
upon
the
commercial
character
of
the
tablets
found
the
large
number
of
day
labels
pierced
for
attachment
to
sacks
and
jars
books
of
entry
in
clay
and
weights
and
measures
so
much
damage
had
been
done
to
the
buildings
while
excavating
however
that
the
appearance
and
plan
of
any
of
the
babylonian
business
houses
and
warehouses
could
not
be
arrived
at

haynes
commenced

for

he
came
upon

asked
for

resulted
from

meagre
the
director
did
not
see
eye

with
his
architects
and
one
of
them
mr
fisher
resigned
returning
however
in
the
autumn
of
the
committee
in
america
requested
haynes
to
confine
his
efforts
to
the
exploration
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
temple
court
and
to
this
task
he
addressed
himself
with
zeal

only
with
partial
success

to
the

reluctantly
consented

returns
professor
hilprecht
now
reappeared
and
his
coming
put
a
new
complexion
on
affairs
a
trained
and
efficient
archæologist
he
saw
at
once
that
hill
represented
the
site
of
the
temple
library
so
resolved
to
leave
its
excavation
to
a
later
expedition
and
meantime
to
settle
the
more
essential
topographical
questions
he
saw
that
these
once
answered
it
would
be
a
comparatively
easy
task
for
the
committee
to
have
the
single
mounds
excavated
one
after
another
by
somebody
else
if
necessity
arose
who
was
less
familiar
with
the
ruins
and
the
history
of
their
exploration
every
trench
cut
henceforth
and
there
were
a
great
many
was
cut
for
the
sole
purpose
of
excavating
structures
systematically
and
of
gathering
necessary
data
for
the
history
and
topography
of
ancient
nippur
if
these
trenches
yielded
tangible
museum
results
at
the
same
time
so
much
the
better
if
they
did
not
he
says
i
was
not
troubled
by
their
absence
however
antiquities
were
found
so
abundantly
in
the
pursuit
of
the
plan
described
that
the
principle
was
established
anew
that
a
strictly
scientific
method
of
excavating
is
at
the
same
time
the
most
profitable
summarizing
his
of
the
ruins
at
hilprecht
writes
a
of
smaller
dimensions
existed
at
nippur
before
sargon
i
about
in
times
the
ground
around
the
sacred
enclosure
was
a
vast
graveyard
a
regular
fire
necropolis
one
of
the
names
of
the
of
nippur
suggested
the
idea
of
a
tomb
to
the
early
inhabitants
of
the
country
in
the
course
of
time
certain
zikkurats
were
directly
designated
by
the
babylonians
as
tombs
of
the
gods
the
of
bel
did
not
occupy
the
centre
of
the
enclosed
platform
but
the
section
of
it
while
the
part
was
reserved
for
house
of
bel
his
principal
sanctuary
which
stood
at
the
side
of
the
the
temple
of
bel
consisted
of
two
large
courts
adjoining
each
other
the
court
with
the
zikkurat
and
house
of
bel
representing
the
most
holy
place
or
the
inner
court
while
the
outer
court
seems
to
have
been
studded
with
the
shrines
of
all
the
different
gods
and
goddesses
worshipped
at
nippur
including
one
for
bel
himself
and
mentioned
in
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
as
the
two
walls
of
nippur
dûru
and
shalkhû
can
not
have
surrounded
the
whole
city
according
to
the
results
of
the
excavations
conducted
under
my
own
supervision
only
the
temple
was
enclosed
by
a
double
wall
while
in
all
probability
the
city
itself
remained
unprotected
the
large
complex
of
buildings
covering
the
top
of
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ancient
temple
below
but
represents
a
huge
fortified
parthian
palace
grouped
around
and
upon
the
remains
of
the
then
visible
by
means
of
careful
tunnelling
hilprecht
also
unearthed
the
side
of
a
but
the
nature
of
the
excavation
risking
as
it
did
a
sudden
collapse
of
soil
and
bricks
was
too
dangerous
to
permit
of
further
labours
upon
it
the
house
of
the
dead
a
of
was
brought
to
light
which
described
the
of
nippur
as
of
the
tomb
before
this
other
titles
of
it
had
been
recovered
which
alluded
to
it
as
of
the
wind
and
it
was
understood
to
have
been
a
local
representation
of
the
great
mythological
of
the
world
this
was
puzzling
until
hilprecht
found
that
the
tower
penetrated
so
far
into
the
earth
as
to
descend
to
the
of
the
dead
which
according
to
babylonian
belief
was
directly
below
and
within
the
earth
the
temple
library
hilprecht
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
temple
library
in
hill
with
results
most
important
for
the
science
of
assyriology
this
building
contemporary
with
the
time
of
abram
now
yielded
large
quantities
of
ancient
tablets
occurring
in
strata
of
from
one
to
four
feet
in
thickness
as
if
they
had
once
been
disposed
upon
wooden
shelves
a
babylonian
museum
an
important
find
was
made
of
a
jar
containing
about
twenty
inscribed
objects
mostly
clay
tablets
which
constituted
a
veritable
small
babylonian
museum
evidently
collected
by
a
late
babylonian
priest
or
someone
connected
with
the
temple
library
archæology
was
probably
fashionable
about
the
time
of
nabonidus
himself
a
monarch
of
antiquarian
tastes
the
collector
of
this
had
actually
taken
a
or
impression
of
an
inscription
of
sargon
i
in
his
time
about
years
old
and
had
even
placed
upon
it
a
label
stating
that
the
object
was
a
or
of
an
inscribed
stone
which
nabûzêrlishir
the
scribe
saw
in
the
palace
of
king
at
agade
says
hilprecht
concerning
this
remarkable
collection
the
owner
or
curator
of
the
little
museum
of
babylonian
originals
must
have
obtained
his
specimens
by
purchase
or
through
personal
excavations
carried
out
in
the
ruined
buildings
of
bel
city
he
doubtless
lived
in
the
sixth
century
about
the
time
of
king
nabonidos
and
was
a
man
well
versed
in
the
ancient
literature
of
his
nation
and
deeply
interested
in
the
past
history
of
nippur
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
his
vase
was
found
in
the
stratum
of
hill
and
from
the
circumstance
that
the
latest
antiquity
of
his
collection
is
dated
in
the
government
of
the
last
representative
of
the
assyrian
dynasty
about
in
the
second
year
of
this
campaign
peters
contented
himself
with
as
many
places
as
possible
rather
than
settling
down
to
the
steady
work
of
excavation
in
which
preference
he
resembled
rassam
but
his
labours
were
crowned
with
no
little
success
for
he
came
upon
a
large
number
of
kassite
votive
objects
the
first
great
collection
of
antiquities
of
this
dynasty
ever
found
and
a
shrine
of
king
i
dedicated
to
bel
about
the
excavation
of
the
large
and
important
building
remains
grouped
around
the
temple
tower
of
bel
was
however
peters
principal
task
during
his
second
campaign
but
his
hope
of
discovering
many
inscribed
tablets
while
excavating
these
ruins
was
not
to
be
realized
he
was
more
fortunate
however
in
the
triangular
mound
that
known
as
iv
to
the
south
of
the
temple
which
yielded
some
tablets
scientific
literary
and
financial
manuscripts
and
even
school
exercises
being
turned
up
by
the
spade
about
the
same
time
excavations
in
the
wing
of
the
large
mounds
disclosed
the
presence
of
thousands
of
tablets
and
many
figures
of
bel
and
his
consort
beltis
most
of
the
tablets
here
were
commercial
and
of
date
about
to
in
may
the
labours
of
the
second
campaign
came
to
a
close
haynes
work
at
nippur
the
third
campaign
peters
delegated
to
haynes
who
commenced
operations
at
nippur
in
the
great
ridge
which
stretches
along
the
southward
bank
of
the
where
numerous
tablets
had
already
been
unearthed
in
about
four
months
he
had
collected
some
tablets
and
when
the
supply
of
these
began
to
fail
he
transferred
his
attention
to
the
temple
mound
which
had
been
worked
at
before
and
which
he
continued
to
explore
until
april
with
the
help
of
joseph
meyer
a
young
american
architect
haynes
concentrated
his
work
on
the
zikkurat
at
nippur
unfortunately
meyer
died
in
december
but
not
until
he
had
rendered
priceless
service
to
haynes
in
his
capacity
as
advisory
architect
haynes
unable
to
continue
the
exploration
of
the
without
expert
advice
undertook
to
unearth
a
sufficient
quantity
of
tablets
to
meet
peters
demand
for
inscribed
material
later
he
pursued
excavations
at
the
where
peters
had
worked
before
him
cleared
the
zikkurat
of
there
and
excavated
the
court
of
that
building
down
to
the
water
level
the
excavation
of
the
immense
façade
of

great
erection
was
a
work
of
enormous
labour
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cubic
feet
of

having
to
be
removed
before
a
partial
clearance
was
effected
the
excavation
of
the
court
of
the
zikkurat
of
was
the
most
interesting
part
of
haynes
work
on
the
temple
of

he
had
to
clear
away
the
parthian
ruins
superimposed
upon
the
site
until
he
came
to
the
brick
pavement
of
he
then
came
upon
a
pavement
of
the
sargonic
period
which
extended
through
a
considerable
part
of
the
mound
as
a
dividing
line
the

which
lay
beneath
this
was
about
sixteen
feet
in

and
had
been
accumulated
within

herodotus
speaks
of
a
babylon
miles
in
circumference
and
ctesias
is
not
much
more
modest
in
his
estimate
of
over
miles
the
city
wall
to
the
side
may
still
be
traced
in
its
entirety
and
remains
to
prove
that
the
city
on
this
side
measured
not
more
than
miles
and
judging
from
this
we
obtain
an
approximate
circumference
of
miles
a
figure
far
short
of
the
estimate
of
the
of
history
the
outer
wall
the
walls
themselves
are
of
considerable
interest
the
outer
wall
was
nearly
twenty
feet
in
thickness
and
was
built
of
burnt
bricks
impressed
with
the
royal
stamp
of
nebuchadrezzar
here
and
there
its
length
was
broken
by
towers
for
outlook
or
defensive
purposes
herodotus
states
that
so
broad
was
the
top
of
the
wall
that
a
chariot
could
easily
turn
upon
its
surface
and
that
two
of
these
vehicles
had
a
sufficiency
of
room
to
pass
one
another
without
risk
to
horses
or
driver
companies
of
men
could
be
moved
along
this
mural
highway
in
time
of
siege
so
that
a
supply
of
defenders
could
be
brought
with
dispatch
to
guard
any
portion
of
the
defences
that
was
imminently
threatened
bâbil
as
a
citadel
the
mound
of
bâbil
to
which
we
have
frequently
referred
in
this
account
of
babylonian
excavation
was
recognized
by
the
german
expedition
as
a
citadel
built
for
defensive
purposes
by
nebuchadrezzar
a
place
of
refuge
to
which
the
king
and
court
could
repair
in
case
of
the
capture
of
the
city
itself
it
contained
the
royal
stores
and
treasury
a
large
armoury
and
arsenal
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
monarch
resided
there
even
in
times
of
peace
it
was
indeed
a
miniature
city
a
lesser
babylon
containing
everything
necessary
for
the
royal
support
and
pleasure
babylon
the
question
of
a
suitable
agitated
municipal
babylon
just
as
keenly
as
it
does
any
of
our
own
great
centres
of
population
and
recent
excavations
have
illustrated
the
manner
in
which
the
euphrates
was
utilized
for
this
purpose
nabopolasser
has
left
inscriptions
to
show
how
he
rebuilt
the
walls
of
a
channel
called
the
arakhtu
to
lead
the
river
euphrates
past
the
city
boundaries
nebuchadrezzar
built
a
massive
fortification
with
walls
of
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
in
thickness
into
the
bed
of
the
euphrates
to
prevent
the
formation
of
sandbanks
in
the
river
which
possibly
caused
the
flooding
of
the
left
bank
above
the
temple
of
this
left
a
narrow
channel
between
the
new
wall
and
the
old
quay
and
it
is
probable
that
this
huge
construction
caused
a
subsequent
change
in
the
course
of
the
euphrates
nebuchadrezzar
palace
nebuchadrezzar
palace
was
situated
in
the
southern
citadel
on
the
mound
known
as
the
kasr
on
this
building
he
lavished
both
time
and
treasure
when
he
came
to
the
throne
he
found
the
site
occupied
by
the
residence
of
his
father
nabopolasser
but
when
he
returned
from
his
triumphant
egyptian
campaigns
he
despised
the
plain
old
place
and
like
some
modern
potentates
resolved
to
build
himself
a
royal
edifice
which
would
symbolize
the
power
and
majesty
of
the
empire
he
had
won
for
himself
he
turned
his
father
palace
into
a
mere
platform
upon
which
to
rear
his
own
more
flamboyant
structure
and
filled
in
its
rooms
courts
and
spaces
with
rubble
the
palace
without
windows
for
the
most
part
the
palace
was
built
round
open
courts
much
in
the
spanish
fashion
and
there
is
no
trace
of
windows
a
phenomenon
which
constantly
recurs
in
ancient
buildings
in
the
east
in
egypt
and
in
central
america
but
when
we
consider
the
extremes
of
heat
encountered
in
these
latitudes
we
can
appreciate
the
desire
for
a
cool
which
called
for
the
windowless
chamber
the
flat
roofs
too
were
used
for
sleeping
purposes
so
that
the
inhabitants
did
not
wholly
dispense
with
fresh
air
the
great
throne
room
but
by
far
the
most
interesting
apartment
in
the
palace
is
the
great
throne
room
of
nebuchadrezzar
the
apartment
upon
which
he
lavished
so
much
personal
care
and
consideration
it
stands
immediately
south
of
the
great
court
and
is
much
the
most
spacious
room
in
the
palace
in
the
wall
opposite
the
grand
entrance
from
the
court
is
a
deep
recess
or
niche
where
it
is
thought
the
royal
throne
must
have
stood
so
that
not
only
the
courtiers
in
the
throne
room
but
the
lesser
dignitaries
thronging
the
courtyard
without
could
have
had
sight
of
the
monarch
of
the
eastern
world
seated
in
all
his
splendour
upon
his
imperial
throne
strangely
enough
the
walls
of
this
great
apartment
of
state
were
merely
plastered
with
white
gypsum
while
the
brickwork
of
the
outer
façade
which
faced
the
court
was
decorated
with
brightly
coloured
enamels
displaying
the
most
involved
designs
floral
and
geometrical
in
blue
yellow
black
and
white
such
ornamentation
would
probably
be
banned
from
the
throne
room
because
of
the
high
reflections
from
a
brightly
polished
enamelled
surface
and
as
we
have
seen
heat
and

were
taboo
in

private

were
placed
further
to

over
the
earlier
residence
of
nabopolasser
the
official
portion
of
the
palace
being
situated
towards
the
east
there
was
a
most
elaborate
drainage
system
which
not
only
carried
from
the
flat
roofs
but
from
the
courts
and
walls
as
well
the
larger
drains
had
roofs
but
the
smaller
ones
were
formed
of
bricks
set
together
in
the
shape
of

closed

were
also
in
use

fortifications
the
hanging
gardens
another
structure
has
been
indicated
as
perhaps
the
foundation
of
the
famous
hanging
gardens
of
babylon
it
consists
of
a
number
of
cells
seven
on
each
side
of
a
central
passage
these
cells
are
roofed
over
with
arches
and
are
flanked
on
the
north
by
the
palace
wall
it
is
known
that
hewn
stone
was
employed
in
the
construction
of
this
of

demesne
the
sacred
road
the
bridge
over

and
the

this
points
to
the
identification
of
the
site
in
question
as
being
that
of
the
hanging
gardens
on
which
layers
of
earth
were
laid
and
the
shrubs
trees
and
arbours
which
decorated
it
planted
thereon
berossus
distinctly
states
that
these
gardens
were
within
the
buildings
by
which
nebuchadrezzar
enlarged
his
father
palace
but
the
dimensions
of
this
structure
do
not
tally
with
those
given
by
strabo
and
diodorus
and
the
imagination
revolts
at
the
conception
of
these
famous
and
romantic
gardens

for
their
foundation
this
obscure
and
prosaic

archæology
must
leave
us
something
by
all
means
let
us
have
truth
and
enlightenment
unless
where
truth
is
itself
uglier
than
falsehood
it
has
been
shrewdly
conjectured
by
professor
king
that
these
cellars
formed
the
palace
granary

we
must
be
grateful
to
him
for
the
suggestion
the

it
was
in
the
spring
of
that
koldewey
made
the
important
discovery
of
the
great
gate
of
the
goddess
ishtar
which
spanned
the
sacred
way
of
the
imperial
city
this
turreted
erection
ornamented
in
relief
by
the
figures
of
mythical
animals
in
coloured
brick
has
been
excavated
clean
out
of
the
superincumbent
earth
and
constitutes
a
double
monument
to
its
ancient
builders
and
to
the
patient
archæologists
who
recovered
it
from
the
sands
of
antiquity
it
was
the
main
gate
in
the
north

and
had
been
reconstructed
by
the
zealous

it
is

was

and
in

consists
of
two
high
towers
with

are
so
arranged
that
to
the
eye
of
one
approaching
the
city
they
would
seem
advancing
to
meet
him
at

of
these
creatures

depicted
on
the
gate
the
favourite
subjects
being

and
dragons

and
realistically
modelled

relief
the
street
of
processions
a
portion
of
the
street
of
processions
upon
which
this
gateway
opened
has
also
been
excavated
this
highway
was
of
imposing
breadth
and
ran
its
course
from
north
to
south
directly
across
the
city
it
was
a
species
of
via
sacra
for
over
its
stones
was
carried
the
image
of
merodach
upon
his
day
of
high
festival
its
use
was
restricted
to
and
no
chariots
or
other
vehicles
were
permitted
to
make
use
of
it
its
foundation
is
of
burnt
brick
upon
which
is
overlaid
an
upper
pavement
of
breccia

rock
in
slabs
the
temples
of
babylon
interest
has
naturally
centred
around
the
excavation
of
the
five
great
temples
of
babylon
the
of
four
of
which
have
been
laid
bare
the
temple
of
dedicated
to
the
goddess
was
the
first
to
be
excavated
it
contains
one
of
the
only
two
altars
found
in
babylon
a
structure
of
plain
crude
brick
simple
and
unadorned
which
stands
outside
its
main
entrance
as
the
only
other
example
in
the
city
occupies
an
exactly
similar
position
we
must
conclude
that
custom
or
ritual
dictated
an
exterior
site
for
the
sacrificial
altar
the
temple
of
was
a
simple
shrine
of
mere
decorated
with
black
and
white
designs
superimposed
upon
a
scanty
coating
of
whitewash
the
great
lady
was
one
of
the
titles
of
ishtar
the
temple
appears
to
have
been
built
round
a
large
court
and
to
have
been
entered
by
a
gateway
flanked
by
a
series
of
square
solid
towers
three
on
either
side
there
is
a
long
narrow
passage
behind
the
shrine
which
probably
gave
access
to
a
concealed
opening
in
the
back
wall
of
the
temple
behind
the
image
of
the
goddess
who
could
thus
have
been
made
to
give
forth
oracular
utterances
in
the
courtyard
was
a
well
from
which
water
was
drawn
for
the
purpose
of
performing
lustral
rites
we
are
ignorant
of
the
precise
form
of
the
upper
part
of
babylonian
temples
apart
from
the
or
towers
as
only
the
lower
portions
of
their
walls
in
most
cases
remain
to
us
but
from
certain
plaques
and
seals
on
which
temples
are
represented
we
can
glean
that
they
were
probably
turreted
or
castellated
in
front
and
perhaps
at
the
sides
as
well
and
that
the
entrance
was
arched
the
frontage
presenting
a
picture
not
very
unlike
that
of
a
heavily
constructed
castle
of
the
norman
epoch
indeed
one
unidentified
temple
bears
resemblance
to
a
prison
so
forbidding
is
it
in
its
almost
unbroken
line
of
turret
and
retaining
wall
we
must
remember
however
that
colour
lent
embellishment
to
these
buildings
the
otherwise
heavy
façades
of
which
would
have
been
dreary
indeed
the
temple
of
which
was
dedicated
to
merodach
patron
deity
of
babylon
is
of
course
by
far
the
most
important
within
the
city
bounds
it
has
not
been
wholly
excavated
from
the
mound
of
tell
amran
but
the
main
western
portion
of
it
has
been
brought
to
light
and
has
been
shown
like
other
babylonian
shrines
to
have
consisted
of
a
series
of
chambers
built
round
an
open
court
in
the
centre
of
each
side
was
an
open
gateway
where
once
stood
the
famous
eight
bronze
serpents
two
to
each
entrance
the
especial
shrine
of
merodach
which
has
not
yet
been
unearthed
lay
on
the
western
side
and
had
a
towered
entrance
and
decorated
façade
which
nebuchadrezzar
stated
he
caused
shine
like
the
sun
he
coated
the
walls
of
the
shrine
with
gold
and
roofed
it
with
the
choicest
cedars
from
lebanon
noble
forest
here
says
herodotus
the
mighty
figure
of
the
god
rested
which
with
the
throne
dais
and
table
before
it
was
fashioned
of
pure
gold
of
talents
in
weight
to
the
north
of
merodach
temple
rose
its
or
tower
so
far
excavation
upon
it
has
in
a
measure
disproved
the
account
of
herodotus
that
it
consisted
of
a
stepped
tower
in
eight
stages
with
the
ascent
to
the
summit
encircling
the
outside
the
first
stage
now
uncovered
has
a
triple
stairway
built
against
one
side
of
the
tower
but
we
shall
never
know
what
the
upper
stories
were
like
for
they
have
long
since
crumbled
into
desert
dust
koldewey
considers
that
the
great
tower
was
built
in
one
stage
decorated
with
coloured
bands
and
surmounted
by
a
shrine
the
great
tower
of
nabu
the
foundations
of
the
great
tower
of
nabu
at
borsippa
a
suburb
of
babylon
still
awaits
excavation
but
as
it
stands
it
rises
to
a
height
of
over
feet
above
the
desert
the
clearing
of
its
base
will
necessitate
a
colossal
amount
of
labour
but
when
effected
our
knowledge
of
these
will
be
considerably
enhanced
the
euphrates
bridge
the
bridge
over
the
river
euphrates
is
worthy
of
mention
since
it
represents
the
oldest
bridge
known
to
the
science
of
archæology
it
possessed
stone
piers
built
in
the
shape
of
boats
thus
showing
that
it
had
been
evolved
from
an
earlier
bridge
of
boats
the
bows
of
these
piers
point
and
thus
break
the
force
of
the
current
the
river
at
the
point
where
it
was
crossed
by
the
bridge
was
at
least
sixty
feet
broad
and
the
of
wood
was
laid
across
the
and
must
have
been
rather
narrow
the
structure
was
the
work
of
nabopolasser
the
elder
babylon
during
the
first
years
of
their
labours
the
excavators
were
under
the
impression
that
the
destruction
of
the
older
portions
of
the
city
by
sennacherib
had
been
so
complete
that
but
few
of
its
remains
were
to
be
looked
for
in
the
course
of
excavation
but
as
time
progressed
it
was
found
that
the
relics
of
the
older
quarters
lay
mostly
beneath
the
present
in
the
menkes
mound
a
quarter
of
the
ancient
city
has
been
unearthed
at
a
depth
of
some
thirty
feet
and
the
outline
of
its
streets
clearly
shown
still
lower
were
found
houses
dating
from
the
period
of
i
and
ii
a
thick
layer
of
ashes
showed
that
a
still
earlier
portion
of
the
city
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
and
this
archaic
quarter
has
been
identified
as
the
city
of
khammurabi
the
princely
and
his
immediate
successors
according
to
dated
tablets
found
among
the
burnt
debris
mute
witnesses
of
the
disaster
which
overtook
babylon
first
dynasty
it
is
noticeable
that
the
later
streets
follow
closely
the
trend
and
plan
of
the
older
thoroughfares
which
generally
speaking
ran
north
and
south
parallel
to
the
course
of
the
sacred
way
professor
king
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
here
we
have
a
deliberate
attempt
at
on
a
scientific
basis
he
credits
this
to
the
semitic
element
in
the
population
as
in
sumerian
towns
there
is
no
trace
of
and
yet
babylon
was
strangely
conservative
as
she
commenced
so
she
continued
and
her
early
efforts
were
only
superseded
in
magnitude
not
in
quality
of
purpose

the
twilight
of
the
gods
with
the
fall
of
the
assyrian
empire
in
babylonia
once
more
regained
her
national
status
this
meant
that
her
national
god
merodach
was
no
longer
subservient
to
the
assyrian
asshur
in
a
political
sense
and
regained
his
place
as
sole
head
of
the
babylonian
pantheon
great
must
have
been
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
of
babylon
when
this
comparatively
mild
tyranny
removed
they
could
worship
their
own
gods
in
their
own
way
free
from
the
humiliating
remembrance
that
their
northern
neighbours
regarded
all
babylonian
sacred
things
as
appanages
of
the
assyrian
empire
nabopolasser
and
nebuchadrezzar
his
successor
gave
effect
to
these
changes
and
the
latter

placed
nabu
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
merodach
was
this
the
cause
of
his
punishment
was
it
because
he
had
offended
in
a
religious
sense
that
he
had
to
undergo
the
terrible
infliction
of
which
we
read
in
the
scriptures
the
priesthood
of
merodach
must
have
possessed
immense
and
practically
unlimited
power
in
babylon
and
we
may
feel
sure
that
any
such
interference
with
their
newfound
privilege
as
is
here
suggested
would
have
met
with
speedy
punishment
was
the
wretched
monarch
led
to
believe
that
an
enchantment
had
been
cast
upon
him
and
that
he
had
been
transformed
into
animal
shape
at
the
command
of
an
outraged
deity
we
can
not
say
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
must
for
ever
remain
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
ancient
world
the
unfortunate
nabonidus
too
attempted
to
replace
the
cults
of
merodach
and
nabu
by
that
of
shamash
and
that
hastened
his
doom
for
the
priests
became
his
bitter
enemies
and
when
the
persian
cyrus
entered
the
gates
of
babylon
as
a
conqueror
he
was
hailed
as
the
saviour
of
merodach
honour
the
last
native
kings
of
babylonia
were
great
and
this
policy
they
continued
until
the
end
indeed
in
the
time
of
nebuchadrezzar
there
was
a
revival
of
ancient
and
cults
and
many
local
gods
were
exalted
to
a
pitch
of
popularity
hitherto
unknown
the
conquering
cyrus
then
in
came
the
conquering
cyrus
and
the
period
of
the
decay
of
the
babylonian
religion
began
the
victor
merely
upheld
the
cults
of
merodach
and
nabu
for
reasons
of
policy
and
when
in
turn
the
greeks
ruled
over
babylonia
they
followed
the
persian
lead
in
this
respect
by
the
defeat
of
the
persian
darius
at
the
battle
of
arbela
the
way
to
babylon
was
left
open
to
the
mighty
alexander
the
great
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
old
religion
dragged
out
a
broken
existence
until
about
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
then
slowly
but
surely
vanished
beneath
the
attacks
of
hellenic
scepticism
christian
propaganda
and
pagan
caprice
that
a
faith
so
virile
so
ancient
so
entrenched
in
the
love
of
a
people
as
that
of
babylonia
should
fall
into
an
oblivion
so
profound
as
to
be
totally
forgotten
for
nearly
nineteen
centuries
is
a
solemn
and
impressive
reminder
of
the
evanescent
character
of
human
affairs
they
were
men
of
their
hands
these
ancient
mesopotamians
great
theologians
great
builders
great
soldiers
yet
their
mighty
works
their
living
faith
left
a
wrack
behind
save
mounds
of
rubbish
which
when
excavated
by
the
modern
antiquary
were
found
to
contain
a
few
poor
vestiges
of
the
splendour
that
was
babylon
and
the
pomps
of
the
city
of
asshur
does
there
not
reside
in
this
a
great
lesson
for
modernity
must
our
civilization
our
faith
all
that
is
ours
and
that
we
have
raised
must
these
things
too
fade
into
the
shadows
of
unremembrance
as
did
the
civilization
of
mesopotamia
a
great
lesson
the
answer
to
such
a
question
depends
upon
ourselves
upon
each
and
every
one
of
us
if
we
quit
ourselves
as
civilized
men
striving
and
ever
striving
to
refine
and
purify
our
lives
our
conduct
our
intellectual
outlook
to
spiritualize
our
faith
then
though
the
things
of
our
hands
may
be
dust
the
works
of
our
minds
of
our
souls
shall
not
vanish
but
shall
remain
in
the
consciousness
of
our
descendants
so
long
as
human
memory
lasts
the
faith
of
ancient
babylon
went
under
because
it
was
built
rather
on
the
worship
of
frail
and
bestial
gods
than
the
love
of
truth
gods
many
of
whom
were
devils
in
disguise
but
devils
no
whit
worse
than
our
fiends
of
ambition
of
greed
of
pugnacity
of
unsympathy
through
the
worship
of
such
gods
babylon
came
to
oblivion
let
us
contemplate
the
colossal
wreck
of
that
mighty
work
of
man
and
as
we
gaze
over
the
gulf
of
a
score
of
centuries
to
where
its
towers
and
gorgeous
palaces
glitter
in
the
mirage
of
legend
let
us
brace
ourselves
for
the
struggle
which
humanity
has
yet
to
wage
with
darkness
with
disease
with
superstition
but
while
we
remember
her
fall
with
sadness
let
us
think
generously
and
kindly
of
her
dead
mightiness
of
the
ancient
effort
she
made
striving
after
her
lights
of
her
picturesque
and
life
and
not
least
of
her
achievements
the
invention
of
those
symbols
by
which
the
words
of
man
can
be
transferred
to
his
brother
across
the

glossary

the
pronunciation
of
assyrian
assyrian
differs
in
many
respects
from
the
other
semitic
languages
there
are
few
gutturals
these
having
been
mostly
smoothed
out
thus
became
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
thought
that
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
may
have
omitted
guttural
sounds
the
cuneiform
system
of
writing
is
so
imperfect
and
complicated
that
we
must
make
certain
reservations
in
our
acceptance
of
the
transcriptions
of
contemporary
assyriologists
and
it
must
therefore
be
understood
that
assyrian
names

words
as
we
know
them
and
as
found
in
the
present

may
be

greatly
modified

researches

guttural

we
are
unaware
whether
the

interpolated
