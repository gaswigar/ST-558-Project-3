chapter
how
the
vikings
of
old
sought
and
found
new
lands
in
days
long
long
ago
there
dwelt
in
greenland
a
king
named
eric
the
red
he
was
a
man
mighty
in
war
and
men
held
him
in
high
honour
now
one
day
to
the
court
of
eric
there
came
bjarni
the
son
of
heriulf
this
bjarni
was
a
far
traveler
he
had
sailed
many
times
upon
the
seas
and
when
he
came
home
he
had
ever
some
fresh
tale
of
marvel
and
adventure
to
tell
but
this
time
he
had
a
tale
to
tell
more
marvelous
than
any
before
for
he
told
how
far
away
across
the
sea
of
greenland
where
no
man
had
sailed
before
he
had
found
a
new
strange
land
but
when
the
people
asked
news
of
this
unknown
land
bjarni
could
tell
them
little
for
he
had
not
set
foot
upon
those
far
shores
therefore
the
people
scorned
him
truly
you
have
little
hardihood
they
said
else
you
had
gone
ashore
and
seen
for
yourself
and
had
given
us
good
account
of
this
land
but
although
bjarni
could
tell
nought
of
the
new
strange
land
save
that
he
had
seen
it
the
people
thought
much
about
it
and
there
was
great
talk
about
voyages
and
discoveries
and
many
longed
to
sail
forth
and
find
again
the
land
which
bjarni
the
traveler
had
seen
but
more
than
any
other
in
that
kingdom
leif
the
son
of
eric
the
red
longed
to
find
that
land
so
leif
went
to
eric
and
said
oh
my
father
i
fain
would
seek
the
land
which
bjarni
the
traveler
has
seen
give
me
gold
that
i
may
buy
his
ship
and
sail
away
upon
the
seas
to
find
it
then
eric
the
red
gave
his
son
gold
in
great
plenty
go
my
son
he
said
buy
the
ship
of
bjarni
the
traveler
and
sail
to
the
land
of
which
he
tells
then
leif
quickly
taking
the
gold
went
to
bjarni
and
bought
his
ship
leif
was
a
tall
man
of
great
strength
and
noble
bearing
he
was
also
a
man
of
wisdom
and
just
in
all
things
so
that
men
loved
and
were
ready
to
obey
him
now
therefore
many
men
came
to
him
offering
to
be
his
companions
in
adventure
until
soon
they
were
a
company
of
men
they
were
all
men
tall
and
of
great
strength
with
fair
golden
hair
and
eyes
blue
as
the
sea
upon
which
they
loved
to
sail
save
only
tyrker
the
german
long
time
this
german
had
lived
with
eric
the
red
and
was
much
beloved
by
him
tyrker
also
loved
leif
dearly
for
he
had
known
him
since
he
was
a
child
and
was
indeed
his
foster
father
so
he
was
eager
to
go
with
leif
upon
this
adventurous
voyage
tyrker
was
very
little
and
plain
his
forehead
was
high
and
his
eyes
small
and
restless
he
wore
shabby
clothes
and
to
the
giants
of
the
north
he
seemed
indeed
a
little
fellow
but
all
that
mattered
little
for
he
was
a
clever
craftsman
and
leif
and
his
companions
were
glad
to
have
him
go
with
them
then
all
things
being
ready
leif
went
to
his
father
and
bending
his
knee
to
him
prayed
him
to
be
their
leader
but
eric
the
red
shook
his
head
nay
my
son
he
said
i
am
old
and
stricken
in
years
and
no
more
able
to
endure
the
hardships
of
the
sea
yet
come
my
father
pleaded
leif
for
of
a
certainty
if
you
do
good
luck
will
go
with
us
then
eric
looked
longingly
at
the
sea
his
heart
bade
him
go
out
upon
it
once
again
ere
he
died
so
he
yielded
to
the
prayers
of
his
son
and
mounting
upon
his
horse
he
rode
towards
the
ship
when
the
saw
him
come
they
set
up
a
shout
of
welcome
but
when
eric
was
not
far
from
the
ship
the
horse
upon
which
he
was
riding
stumbled
and
he
was
thrown
to
the
ground
he
tried
to
rise
but
could
not
for
his
foot
was
sorely
wounded
seeing
that
he
cried
out
sadly
it
is
not
for
me
to
discover
new
lands
go
ye
without
me
so
eric
the
red
returned
to
his
home
and
leif
went
on
his
way
to
his
ship
with
his
companions
now
they
busied
themselves
and
set
their
vessel
in
order
and
when
all
was
ready
they
spread
their
sails
and
sailed
out
into
the
unknown
sea
westward
and
ever
westward
they
sailed
towards
the
setting
of
the
sun
for
many
days
they
sailed
yet
they
saw
no
land
nought
was
about
them
but
the
restless
tossing
waves
but
at
length
one
day
to
their
watching
eyes
there
appeared
a
faint
grey
line
far
on
the
horizon
then
their
hearts
bounded
for
joy
they
had
not
sailed
in
vain
for
land
was
near
surely
said
leif
as
they
drew
close
to
it
this
is
the
land
which
bjarni
saw
let
it
not
be
said
of
us
that
we
passed
it
by
as
he
did
so
casting
anchor
leif
and
his
companions
launched
a
boat
and
went
ashore
but
it
was
no
fair
land
to
which
they
had
come
far
inland
great
mountains
rose
and
between
them
and
the
sea
lay
flat
and
barren
rock
where
no
grass
or
green
thing
grew
it
seemed
to
leif
and
his
companions
that
there
was
no
good
thing
in
this
land
i
will
call
it
helluland
or
stone
land
said
leif
then
he
and
his
companions
went
back
to
the
ship
and
put
out
to
sea
once
more
they
came
to
land
again
after
some
time
and
again
they
cast
anchor
and
launched
a
boat
and
went
ashore
this
land
was
flat
broad
stretches
of
white
sand
sloped
gently
to
the
sea
and
behind
the
level
plain
was
thickly
wooded
this
land
said
leif
shall
also
have
a
name
after
its
nature
so
he
called
it
markland
or
woodland
then
again
leif
and
his
companions
returned
to
the
ship
and
mounting
into
it
they
sailed
away
upon
the
sea
and
now
fierce
winds
arose
and
the
ship
was
driven
before
the
blast
so
that
for
days
these
seafarers
thought
no
more
of
finding
new
lands
but
only
of
the
safety
of
their
ship
but
at
length
the
wind
fell
and
the
sun
shone
forth
once
more
then
again
they
saw
land
and
launching
their
boat
they
rowed
ashore
to
the
eyes
of
these
men
who
for
many
days
had
seen
only
the
wild
waste
of
waters
the
land
seemed
passing
fair
for
the
grass
was
green
and
as
the
sun
shone
upon
it
seemed
to
sparkle
with
a
thousand
diamonds
when
the
men
put
their
hands
upon
the
grass
and
touched
their
mouths
with
their
hands
and
drank
the
dew
it
seemed
to
them
that
never
before
had
they
tasted
anything
so
sweet
so
pleasant
the
land
seemed
to
leif
and
his
companions
that
they
determined
to
pass
the
winter
there
they
therefore
drew
their
ship
up
the
river
which
flowed
into
the
sea
and
cast
anchor
then
they
carried
their
hammocks
ashore
and
set
to
work
to
build
a
house
when
the
house
was
finished
leif
called
his
companions
together
and
spoke
to
them
i
will
now
divide
our
company
into
two
bands
he
said
so
that
we
may
explore
the
country
round
about
one
half
shall
stay
at
home
and
the
other
half
shall
explore
the
land
but
they
who
go
to
explore
must
not
go
so
far
away
that
they
can
not
return
home
at
night
nor
must
they
separate
from
each
other
lest
they
be
lost
and
as
leif
said
so
it
was
done
each
day
a
company
set
out
to
explore
and
sometimes
leif
went
with
the
exploring
party
and
sometimes
he
stayed
at
home
but
each
day
as
evening
came
they
all
returned
to
their
house
and
told
what
they
had
seen
at
length
however
one
day
when
those
who
had
gone
abroad
returned
one
of
their
number
was
missing
and
when
the
roll
was
called
it
was
found
that
it
was
tyrker
the
german
who
had
strayed
thereat
leif
was
sorely
troubled
for
he
loved
his
dearly
so
he
spoke
sternly
to
his
men
reproaching
them
for
their
carelessness
in
letting
tyrker
separate
from
them
and
taking
twelve
of
his
men
with
him
he
set
out
at
once
to
search
for
his
but
they
had
not
gone
far
when
to
their
great
joy
they
saw
their
lost
comrade
coming
towards
them
why
art
thou
so
late
oh
my
cried
leif
as
he
ran
to
him
why
hast
thou
gone
astray
from
the
others
but
tyrker
paid
little
heed
to
leif
questions
he
was
strangely
excited
and
rolling
his
eyes
wildly
he
laughed
and
spoke
in
german
which
no
one
understood
at
length
however
he
grew
calmer
and
spoke
to
them
in
their
own
language
i
did
not
go
much
farther
than
the
others
he
said
but
i
have
found
something
new
i
have
found
vines
and
grapes
is
that
indeed
true
my
said
leif
of
a
certainty
it
is
true
replied
tyrker
for
i
was
born
where
vines
grow
freely
this
was
great
news
and
all
the
men
were
eager
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
the
vines
which
tyrker
had
discovered
but
it
was
already
late
so
they
all
returned
to
the
house
and
waited
with
what
patience
they
could
until
morning
then
as
soon
as
it
was
day
tyrker
led
his
companions
to
the
place
where
he
had
found
the
grapes
and
when
leif
saw
them
he
called
the
land
vineland
because
of
them
he
also
decided
to
load
his
ship
with
grapes
and
wood
and
depart
homeward
so
each
day
the
men
gathered
grapes
and
felled
trees
until
the
ship
was
full
then
they
set
sail
for
home
the
winds
were
fair
and
with
but
few
adventures
they
arrived
safely
at
home
there
they
were
received
with
great
rejoicing
henceforth
leif
was
called
leif
the
lucky
and
he
lived
ever
after
in
great
honour
and
plenty
and
the
land
which
he
had
discovered
men
called
vineland
the
good
in
due
time
however
eric
the
red
died
and
after
that
leif
the
lucky
sailed
no
more
upon
the
seas
for
his
father
kingdom
was
now
his
and
he
must
needs
stay
at
home
to
rule
his
land
but
brother
thorvald
greatly
desired
to
go
to
vineland
so
that
he
might
explore
the
country
still
further
then
when
leif
saw
his
brother
desire
he
said
to
him
if
it
be
thy
will
brother
thou
mayest
go
to
vineland
in
my
ship
at
that
thorvald
rejoiced
greatly
and
gathering
thirty
men
he
set
sail
crossed
the
sea
without
adventure
and
came
to
the
place
where
leif
had
built
his
house
there
he
and
his
company
remained
during
the
winter
then
in
the
spring
they
set
forth
to
explore
the
coast
after
some
time
they
came
upon
a
fair
country
where
there
were
many
trees
when
thorvald
saw
it
he
said
it
is
so
fair
a
country
that
i
should
like
to
make
my
home
here
until
this
time
the
norsemen
had
seen
no
inhabitants
of
the
land
but
now
as
they
returned
to
their
ship
they
saw
three
mounds
upon
the
shore
when
the
norsemen
came
near
they
saw
that
these
three
mounds
were
three
canoes
and
under
each
were
three
men
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
who
lay
in
wait
to
slay
them
when
the
norsemen
saw
that
they
divided
their
company
and
put
themselves
in
battle
array
and
after
a
fierce
battle
they
slew
the
savages
save
one
who
fled
to
his
canoe
and
so
escaped
when
the
fight
was
over
the
norsemen
climbed
upon
a
high
headland
and
looked
round
to
see
if
there
were
signs
of
any
more
savages
below
them
they
saw
several
mounds
which
they
took
to
be
the
houses
of
the
savages
and
knew
that
it
behooved
them
therefore
to
be
on
their
guard
but
they
were
too
weary
to
go
further
and
casting
themselves
down
upon
the
ground
where
they
were
they
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
suddenly
they
were
awakened
by
a
great
shout
and
they
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
cry
aloud
awake
thorvald
thou
and
all
thy
company
if
ye
would
save
your
lives
flee
to
thy
ship
with
all
thy
men
and
sail
with
speed
from
this
land
so
thorvald
and
his
companions
fled
speedily
to
their
ship
and
set
it
in
fighting
array
soon
a
crowd
of
savages
uttering
fearful
yells
rushed
upon
them
they
cast
their
arrows
at
the
norsemen
and
fought
fiercely
for
some
time
but
seeing
that
their
arrows
availed
little
against
the
strangers
and
that
on
the
other
hand
many
of
their
braves
were
slain
they
at
last
fled
then
the
enemy
being
fled
thorvald
turning
to
his
men
asked
are
any
of
you
wounded
nay
they
answered
we
are
all
whole
that
is
well
said
thorvald
as
for
me
i
am
wounded
in
the
armpit
by
an
arrow
here
is
the
shaft
of
a
surety
it
will
cause
my
death
and
now
i
counsel
you
turn
homeward
with
all
speed
but
carry
me
first
to
that
headland
which
seemed
to
me
to
promise
so
pleasant
a
and
lay
me
there
thus
it
shall
be
seen
that
i
spoke
truth
when
i
wished
to
abide
there
and
ye
shall
place
a
cross
at
my
feet
and
another
at
my
head
and
call
it
cross
ness
ever
after
so
thorvald
died
then
his
companions
buried
him
as
he
had
bidden
them
in
the
land
which
had
seemed
to
him
so
fair
and
as
he
had
commanded
they
set
a
cross
at
his
feet
and
another
at
his
head
and
called
the
place
cross
ness
thus
the
first
white
man
was
laid
to
rest
in
vineland
the
good
then
when
spring
came
the
norsemen
sailed
home
to
greenland
and
there
they
told
leif
of
all
the
things
they
had
seen
and
done
and
how
his
brave
brother
had
met
his
death
now
when
leif
brother
thorstein
heard
how
thorvald
had
died
he
longed
to
sail
to
vineland
to
bring
home
his
brother
body
so
once
again
leif
ship
was
made
ready
and
with
five
and
twenty
tall
strong
men
thorstein
set
forth
taking
with
him
his
wife
gudrid
but
thorstein
never
saw
vineland
the
good
for
storms
beset
his
ship
and
after
being
driven
hither
and
thither
for
many
months
he
lost
all
reckoning
and
at
last
came
to
land
in
greenland
once
more
and
there
thorstein
died
and
gudrid
went
home
to
leif
now
there
came
to
greenland
that
summer
a
man
of
great
wealth
named
thorfinn
and
when
he
saw
gudrid
he
loved
her
and
sought
her
in
marriage
and
leif
giving
his
consent
to
it
thorfinn
and
gudrid
were
married
at
this
time
many
people
still
talked
of
the
voyages
to
vineland
and
they
urged
thorfinn
to
journey
thither
and
seek
to
find
out
more
about
these
strange
lands
and
more
than
all
the
others
gudrid
urged
him
to
go
so
at
length
thorfinn
determined
to
undertake
the
voyage
but
it
came
to
his
mind
that
he
would
not
merely
go
to
vineland
and
return
home
again
he
resolved
rather
to
settle
there
and
make
it
his
home
thorfinn
therefore
gathered
about
sixty
men
and
those
who
had
wives
took
also
their
wives
with
them
together
with
their
cattle
and
their
household
goods
then
thorfinn
asked
leif
to
give
him
the
house
which
he
had
built
in
vineland
and
leif
replied
i
will
lend
the
house
to
you
but
i
will
not
give
it
so
thorfinn
and
gudrid
and
all
their
company
sailed
out
to
sea
and
without
adventures
arrived
safely
at
leif
house
in
vineland
there
they
lived
all
that
winter
in
great
comfort
there
was
no
lack
of
food
either
for
man
or
beast
and
the
cattle
they
had
brought
with
them
roamed
at
will
and
fed
upon
the
wide
prairie
lands
all
winter
and
spring
the
norsemen
dwelt
in
vineland
and
they
saw
no
human
beings
save
themselves
then
one
day
in
early
summer
they
saw
a
great
troop
of
natives
come
out
of
the
wood
they
were
dark
and
little
and
it
seemed
to
the
norsemen
very
ugly
with
great
eyes
and
broad
cheeks
the
cattle
were
near
and
as
the
savages
appeared
the
bull
began
to
bellow
and
when
the
savages
heard
that
sound
they
were
afraid
and
fled
for
three
whole
weeks
nothing
more
was
seen
of
them
after
that
time
however
they
took
courage
again
and
returned
as
they
approached
they
made
signs
to
show
that
they
came
in
peace
and
with
them
they
brought
huge
bales
of
furs
which
they
wished
to
barter
the
norsemen
it
is
true
could
not
understand
the
language
of
the
natives
nor
could
the
natives
understand
the
norsemen
but
by
signs
they
made
known
that
they
wished
to
barter
their
furs
for
weapons
this
however
thorfinn
forbade
instead
he
gave
them
strips
of
red
cloth
which
they
took
very
eagerly
and
bound
about
their
heads
thorfinn
also
commanded
his
men
to
take
milk
to
the
savages
and
when
they
saw
it
they
were
eager
to
buy
and
drink
it
so
that
it
was
said
many
of
them
carried
away
their
merchandise
in
their
stomachs
thus
the
days
and
months
passed
then
one
summer
day
a
little
son
was
born
to
thorfinn
and
gudrid
they
called
him
snorri
and
he
was
the
first
white
child
to
be
born
on
the
continent
which
later
men
called
the
new
world
thus
three
years
went
past
but
the
days
were
not
all
peaceful
for
quarrels
arose
between
the
newcomers
and
the
natives
and
the
savages
attacked
the
norsemen
and
killed
many
of
them
then
thorfinn
said
he
would
no
longer
stay
in
vineland
but
would
return
to
greenland
so
he
and
all
his
company
made
ready
their
ship
and
sailed
out
upon
the
seas
and
came
at
length
safely
to
greenland
then
after
a
time
thorfinn
sailed
to
iceland
there
he
made
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
people
holding
him
in
high
honour
snorri
also
his
son
who
had
been
born
in
vineland
grew
to
be
a
man
of
great
renown
such
are
some
of
the
old
norse
stories
of
the
first
finding
of
america
the
country
which
leif
called
helluland
was
most
likely
labrador
markland
newfoundland
and
vineland
nova
scotia
besides
these
there
were
many
other
tales
of
voyages
to
vineland
for
after
leif
and
his
brothers
many
other
vikings
of
the
north
sailed
both
from
greenland
and
from
norway
to
the
fair
western
lands
yet
although
they
sailed
there
so
often
these
old
norsemen
had
no
idea
that
they
had
discovered
a
vast
continent
they
thought
that
vineland
was
merely
an
island
and
the
discovery
of
it
made
no
stir
in
europe
by
degrees
too
the
voyages
thither
ceased
in
days
of
wild
warfare
at
home
the
norsemen
forgot
the
fair
western
land
which
leif
had
discovered
they
heard
of
it
only
in
minstrel
tales
and
it
came
to
be
for
them
a
sort
of
which
had
no
existence
save
in
a
poet
dream
but
now
wise
men
have
read
these
tales
with
care
and
many
have
come
to
believe
that
they
are
not
mere
fairy
stories
they
have
come
to
believe
that
hundreds
of
years
before
columbus
lived
the
vikings
of
the
north
sailed
the
western
seas
and
found
the
land
which
lay
beyond
the
land
which
we
now
call
america
chapter
the
sea
of
darkness
and
the
great
faith
of
columbus
in
those
times
besides
the
vikings
of
the
north
other
daring
sailors
sailed
the
seas
but
all
their
sailings
took
them
eastward
for
it
was
from
the
east
that
all
the
trade
and
the
riches
came
in
those
days
to
india
and
to
far
cathay
sailed
the
merchant
through
the
red
sea
and
the
indian
ocean
to
return
with
a
rich
and
fragrant
cargo
of
silks
and
spices
pearls
and
priceless
gems
none
thought
of
sailing
westward
for
to
men
of
those
days
the
atlantic
ocean
was
known
as
the
outer
sea
or
the
sea
of
darkness
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
venturing
upon
it
much
to
be
dreaded
it
was
said
that
huge
and
horrible
lived
there
ready
to
wreck
and
swallow
down
any
vessel
that
might
venture
near
an
enormous
bird
also
hovered
in
the
skies
waiting
to
pounce
upon
vessels
and
bear
them
away
to
some
unknown
eyrie
even
if
any
foolhardy
adventurers
should
defy
these
dangers
and
escape
the
horror
of
the
dragons
and
the
bird
other
perils
threatened
them
for
far
in
the
west
there
lay
a
bottomless
pit
of
seething
fire
that
was
easy
of
proof
did
not
the
face
of
the
setting
sun
glow
with
the
reflected
light
as
it
sank
in
the
west
there
would
be
no
hope
nor
rescue
for
any
ship
that
should
be
drawn
into
that
awful
pit
again
it
was
believed
that
the
ocean
flowed
downhill
and
that
if
a
ship
sailed
down
too
far
it
would
never
be
able
to
get
back
again
these
and
many
other
dangers
said
the
ignorant
people
of
those
days
threatened
the
rash
sailors
who
should
attempt
to
sail
upon
the
sea
of
darkness
so
it
was
not
wonderful
that
for
hundreds
of
years
men
contented
themselves
with
the
routes
which
indeed
offered
adventure
enough
to
satisfy
the
heart
of
the
most
daring
but
as
time
passed
these
old
fell
more
and
more
into
the
hands
of
turks
and
infidels
port
after
port
came
under
their
rule
and
infidel
pirates
swarmed
in
the
indian
ocean
and
mediterranean
until
no
christian
vessel
was
safe
at
every
step
christian
traders
found
themselves
hampered
and
hindered
and
in
danger
of
their
lives
and
they
began
to
long
for
another
way
to
the
lands
of
spice
and
pearls
then
it
was
that
men
turned
their
thoughts
to
the
dread
sea
of
darkness
the
less
ignorant
among
them
had
begun
to
disbelieve
the
tales
of
dragons
and
fiery
pits
the
world
was
round
said
wise
men
why
then
if
that
were
so
india
could
be
reached
by
sailing
west
as
well
as
by
sailing
east
many
men
now
came
to
this
conclusion
among
them
an
italian
sailor
named
christopher
columbus
the
more
columbus
thought
about
his
plan
of
sailing
west
to
reach
india
the
more
he
believed
in
it
and
the
more
he
longed
to
set
out
but
without
a
great
deal
of
money
such
an
expedition
was
impossible
and
columbus
was
poor
his
only
hope
was
to
win
the
help
and
friendship
of
a
king
or
some
other
great
and
wealthy
person
the
portuguese
were
in
those
days
a
people
and
their
ships
were
to
be
found
wherever
ships
dared
go
indeed
prince
henry
of
portugal
did
so
much
to
encourage
voyages
of
discovery
that
he
was
called
henry
the
navigator
and
although
he
was
by
this
time
dead
the
people
still
took
great
interest
in
voyages
of
discovery
so
at
length
columbus
determined
to
go
to
king
john
of
portugal
to
tell
him
of
his
plans
and
ask
for
his
aid
king
john
listened
kindly
enough
it
seemed
to
what
columbus
had
to
say
but
before
giving
him
any
answer
he
said
that
he
must
consult
his
wise
men
these
wise
men
looked
upon
the
whole
idea
of
sailing
to
the
west
to
reach
the
east
as
absurd
so
king
john
refused
to
give
columbus
any
help
yet
although
most
of
king
john
wise
men
thought
little
of
the
plan
king
john
himself
thought
that
there
was
something
in
it
but
instead
of
helping
columbus
he
meanly
resolved
to
send
out
an
expedition
of
his
own
this
he
did
and
when
columbus
heard
of
it
he
was
so
angry
that
he
left
portugal
which
for
more
than
ten
years
he
had
made
his
home
he
was
poor
and
in
debt
so
he
left
the
country
secretly
in
fear
of
the
king
and
of
those
to
whom
he
owed
money
when
columbus
thus
fled
from
portugal
penniless
and
in
debt
he
was
a
man
over
forty
he
was
a
bitterly
disappointed
man
too
but
he
still
clung
to
his
great
idea
so
he
sent
his
brother
bartholomew
to
england
to
beg
king
henry
vii
to
help
him
while
he
himself
turned
towards
spain
bartholomew
however
reached
england
in
an
evil
hour
for
his
quest
for
henry
vii
had
but
newly
wrested
the
crown
from
richard
iii
and
so
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
unknown
lands
christopher
also
arrived
in
spain
at
an
unfortunate
time
for
the
spaniards
were
carrying
on
a
fierce
warfare
against
the
moors
and
king
ferdinand
and
queen
isabella
had
little
thought
or
money
to
spare
for
any
other
undertaking
therefore
although
ferdinand
listened
to
what
columbus
had
to
say
for
the
time
being
he
could
promise
no
help
so
years
passed
columbus
remained
in
spain
for
in
spite
of
all
his
rebuffs
and
disappointments
he
did
not
despair
as
the
court
moved
from
place
to
place
he
followed
it
hoping
always
that
the
day
would
come
when
the
king
and
queen
would
listen
to
him
and
believe
in
his
great
enterprise
meanwhile
he
lived
in
want
and
misery
and
just
kept
himself
from
starvation
by
making
and
selling
maps
to
the
common
people
he
seemed
a
madman
and
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
in
his
worn
and
threadbare
garments
children
jeered
and
pointed
fingers
of
scorn
at
him
yet
in
spite
of
mockery
and
derision
columbus
clung
to
his
faith
indeed
it
burned
in
him
so
strongly
that
at
length
he
made
others
share
it
too
and
men
who
were
powerful
at
court
became
his
friends
at
last
the
war
with
the
moors
ended
victoriously
for
spain
then
these
friends
persuaded
queen
isabella
to
listen
again
to
what
columbus
had
to
say
to
this
the
queen
consented
and
when
she
heard
how
poor
columbus
was
she
sent
him
some
money
so
that
he
might
buy
clothes
fit
to
appear
at
court
when
columbus
heard
the
good
news
he
was
overjoyed
as
quickly
as
might
be
he
bought
new
clothes
and
mounting
upon
a
mule
he
rode
towards
granada
but
when
columbus
arrived
he
found
the
court
still
in
the
midst
of
rejoicings
to
celebrate
victory
among
the
gaily
dressed
throng
there
was
no
one
who
had
a
thought
to
spare
for
the
melancholy
dreamer
who
passed
like
a
dark
shadow
amidst
them
with
his
fate
as
it
were
trembling
in
the
balance
columbus
had
no
heart
for
rejoicing
so
he
looked
on
with
indifference
almost
with
contempt
but
at
length
his
day
came
at
length
all
the
jubilation
was
over
and
ferdinand
and
isabella
turned
their
thoughts
to
columbus
he
came
before
them
and
talked
so
earnestly
of
his
great
project
that
they
could
not
but
believe
in
it
the
day
was
won
both
king
and
queen
but
more
especially
the
queen
were
willing
to
help
the
great
enterprise
now
however
columbus
himself
all
but
wrecked
his
chances
he
had
dreamed
so
long
about
this
splendid
adventure
he
was
so
filled
with
belief
in
its
grandeur
that
he
demanded
conditions
such
as
would
hardly
have
been
granted
to
the
greatest
prince
in
the
land
columbus
demanded
that
he
should
be
made
admiral
and
viceroy
of
all
the
lands
he
might
discover
and
that
after
his
death
this
honour
should
descend
to
his
son
and
to
his
son
son
for
ever
and
ever
he
also
demanded
a
tenth
part
of
all
the
pearls
precious
stones
gold
silver
and
spices
or
whatever
else
he
might
gain
by
trade
or
barter
at
these
demands
the
grandees
of
spain
stood
aghast
what
this
shabby
dreamer
this
penniless
beggar
aspired
to
honour
and
dignities
fit
for
a
prince
it
was
absurd
and
not
to
be
thought
of
if
this
beggarly
sailor
would
have
spain
assist
him
he
must
needs
be
more
humble
in
suit
but
not
one
jot
would
columbus
abate
of
his
demands
so
the
council
broke
up
and
columbus
with
anger
and
disappointment
in
his
heart
mounted
his
mule
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
court
of
france
all
the
seven
long
years
during
which
he
had
waited
and
hoped
and
prayed
in
spain
had
been
wasted
now
he
would
go
to
the
king
of
france
and
make
his
last
appeal
there
but
columbus
had
left
friends
behind
him
friends
who
had
begun
to
picture
to
themselves
almost
as
vividly
as
he
the
splendours
of
the
conquest
he
was
to
make
now
these
friends
sought
out
the
queen
in
glowing
words
they
painted
to
her
the
glory
and
the
honour
which
would
come
to
spain
if
columbus
succeeded
and
if
he
failed
why
what
were
a
few
thousand
crowns
they
asked
and
as
the
queen
listened
her
heart
beat
fast
the
magnificence
of
the
enterprise
took
hold
upon
her
and
she
resolved
that
come
what
might
columbus
should
go
forth
on
his
adventure
ferdinand
however
still
looked
coldly
on
the
war
against
the
moors
had
been
long
and
bitter
his
treasury
was
empty
whence
he
asked
himself
was
money
forthcoming
for
this
mad
scheme
isabella
however
had
done
with
prudence
and
caution
if
there
is
not
money
enough
in
aragon
she
cried
i
will
undertake
this
adventure
for
my
own
kingdom
of
castile
and
if
need
be
i
will
pawn
my
jewels
to
do
it
while
these
things
were
happening
columbus
sick
at
heart
was
slowly
plodding
on
the
road
to
france
but
he
only
went
a
little
way
on
his
long
journey
for
just
as
he
was
entering
a
narrow
pass
not
far
from
granada
where
the
mountains
towered
above
him
he
heard
the
thud
of
horses
hoofs
it
was
a
lonely
and
silent
spot
among
the
hills
where
robbers
lurked
and
where
many
a
man
had
been
slain
for
the
money
and
jewels
he
carried
columbus
however
had
nothing
to
dread
he
carried
with
him
neither
gold
nor
jewels
he
went
forth
from
spain
a
beggar
even
as
he
had
come
but
if
fear
he
had
any
it
was
soon
turned
to
incredulous
joy
for
when
the
horsemen
came
up
they
told
columbus
that
his
friends
had
won
the
day
for
him
and
that
he
must
return
at
first
columbus
hesitated
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
truly
at
last
he
had
his
heart
desire
when
however
the
messenger
told
him
that
the
queen
herself
bade
him
return
he
hesitated
no
longer
joyfully
turning
his
mule
he
hastened
back
to
granada
at
last
columbus
had
won
his
heart
desire
and
he
had
only
to
gather
ships
and
men
and
set
forth
westward
but
now
a
new
difficulty
arose
for
it
was
out
upon
the
terrible
sea
of
darkness
that
columbus
wished
to
sail
and
men
feared
to
face
its
terrors
week
after
week
went
past
and
not
a
ship
or
a
man
could
columbus
get
he
persuaded
and
implored
in
vain
no
man
was
brave
enough
to
follow
him
to
the
unknown
horrors
of
the
sea
of
darkness
therefore
as
entreaty
and
persuasion
proved
of
no
avail
columbus
sought
help
from
the
king
who
gave
him
power
to
force
men
to
go
with
him
even
then
all
sorts
of
difficulties
were
thrown
in
the
way
columbus
however
overcame
them
all
and
at
length
his
three
ships
were
ready
but
it
had
taken
many
months
it
was
february
when
he
turned
back
so
gladly
to
granada
it
was
the
third
of
august
before
everything
was
in
order
before
dawn
upon
the
day
he
sailed
columbus
entered
the
church
in
the
little
town
of
palos
where
his
ships
lay
at
anchor
there
he
humbly
confessed
his
sins
received
the
sacrament
and
committed
himself
to
god
guidance
the
crew
wild
rough
fellows
many
of
them
followed
his
example
then
columbus
stepped
on
board
his
ship
the
santa
maria
and
turned
his
face
westward
he
was
filled
with
exaltation
but
all
palos
was
filled
with
gloom
and
upon
the
shore
a
great
crowd
gathered
to
bid
a
last
farewell
to
these
daring
adventurers
and
as
the
ships
spread
their
sails
and
sped
forth
in
the
morning
light
the
people
wept
and
lamented
sorely
for
they
never
thought
again
to
see
their
loved
ones
who
were
about
to
adventure
forth
upon
the
terrible
sea
of
darkness
chapter
how
columbus
fared
forth
upon
the
sea
of
darkness
and
came
to
pleasant
lands
beyond
at
first
the
voyage
upon
which
columbus
and
his
daring
companions
now
set
forth
lay
through
seas
already
known
but
soon
the
last
was
left
behind
and
the
three
little
vessels
smaller
than
river
craft
of
today
were
alone
upon
the
trackless
waste
of
waters
and
when
the
men
saw
the
last
trace
of
land
vanish
their
hearts
sank
and
they
shed
bitter
tears
weeping
for
home
and
the
loved
ones
they
thought
never
more
to
see
on
and
on
they
sailed
and
as
day
after
day
no
land
appeared
the
men
grew
restless
seeing
them
thus
restless
and
lest
they
should
be
utterly
terrified
at
being
so
far
from
home
upon
this
seemingly
endless
waste
of
waters
columbus
determined
to
keep
them
from
knowing
how
far
they
had
really
gone
so
he
kept
two
reckonings
one
in
which
the
real
length
of
the
ships
daily
journey
was
given
he
kept
to
himself
the
other
in
which
the
journey
was
given
as
much
shorter
he
showed
to
the
sailors
a
month
went
past
six
weeks
went
past
and
still
there
was
no
trace
of
land
then
at
length
came
signs
snow
birds
which
never
ventured
far
to
sea
flew
round
the
ships
now
the
waves
bore
to
them
a
rudely
carved
stick
now
the
ships
ploughed
a
way
through
masses
of
floating
weeds
all
these
signs
were
at
first
greeted
with
joy
and
hope
and
the
sailors
took
heart
but
as
still
the
days
went
past
and
no
land
appeared
they
lost
heart
again
the
fields
of
weeds
which
they
had
at
first
greeted
with
joy
now
became
an
added
terror
would
they
not
be
caught
in
this
tangle
of
weeds
they
asked
and
never
more
win
a
way
out
of
it
to
their
fearful
and
superstitious
minds
the
very
breeze
which
had
borne
them
softly
onward
became
a
menace
for
if
the
wind
always
blew
steadily
from
the
east
how
was
it
possible
ever
to
return
to
spain
so
columbus
was
almost
glad
when
a
contrary
wind
blew
for
it
proved
to
his
trembling
sailors
that
one
at
least
of
their
fears
was
groundless
but
it
made
little
difference
the
men
were
now
utterly
given
over
to
gloomy
terrors
fear
robbed
them
of
all
ambition
ferdinand
and
isabella
had
promised
a
large
sum
of
money
to
the
man
who
should
first
discover
land
but
none
cared
now
to
win
it
all
they
desired
was
to
turn
home
once
more
fear
made
them
mutinous
also
so
they
whispered
together
and
planned
in
secret
to
rid
themselves
of
columbus
it
would
be
easy
they
thought
to
throw
him
overboard
some
dark
night
and
then
give
out
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
sea
by
accident
no
one
would
know
no
one
in
spain
would
care
for
columbus
was
after
all
but
a
foreigner
and
an
upstart
the
great
ocean
would
keep
the
secret
they
would
be
free
to
turn
homeward
columbus
saw
their
dark
looks
heard
the
murmurs
of
the
crews
and
did
his
best
to
hearten
them
again
he
spoke
to
them
cheerfully
persuading
and
encouraging
laughing
at
them
while
in
his
heart
he
wept
still
the
men
went
sullenly
about
their
work
but
at
length
one
morning
a
sudden
cry
from
the
pinta
shook
them
from
out
their
sullen
thoughts
it
was
the
captain
of
the
pinta
who
shouted
land
land
my
lord
he
cried
i
claim
the
reward
and
when
columbus
heard
that
shout
his
heart
was
filled
with
joy
and
thankfulness
and
baring
his
head
he
sank
upon
his
knees
giving
praise
to
god
the
crew
followed
his
example
then
their
hearts
suddenly
light
and
joyous
they
swarmed
up
the
masts
and
into
the
rigging
to
feast
their
eyes
upon
the
goodly
sight
all
day
they
sailed
onward
toward
the
promised
land
the
sun
sank
and
still
all
night
the
ships
sped
on
their
joyous
way
but
when
morning
dawned
the
land
seemed
no
nearer
than
before
hope
died
away
again
and
sorrowfully
as
the
day
went
on
the
woeful
truth
that
the
fancied
land
had
been
but
a
bank
of
clouds
was
forced
upon
columbus
again
for
days
the
ships
sailed
on
and
as
still
no
land
appeared
the
men
again
began
to
murmur
then
one
day
when
columbus
walked
on
deck
he
was
met
not
merely
with
sullen
looks
but
with
angry
words
the
men
clamoured
to
return
and
if
the
admiral
refused
why
so
much
the
worse
for
him
they
would
endure
no
longer
bravely
the
admiral
faced
the
mutineers
he
talked
to
them
cheerfully
he
reminded
them
of
what
honour
and
gain
would
be
theirs
when
they
returned
home
having
found
the
new
way
to
india
of
what
wealth
they
might
win
by
trading
then
he
ended
sternly
complain
how
you
may
he
said
i
have
to
go
to
the
indies
and
i
will
go
on
till
i
find
them
so
help
me
god
for
the
time
being
the
admiral
stern
brave
words
cowed
the
mutineers
but
not
for
much
longer
columbus
knew
right
well
would
they
obey
him
if
land
did
not
soon
appear
and
in
his
heart
he
prayed
god
that
it
might
not
be
long
delayed
the
next
night
columbus
stood
alone
upon
the
poop
of
the
santa
maria
full
of
anxious
thoughts
he
gazed
out
into
the
darkness
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
far
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
glimmering
light
appear
and
disappear
once
and
again
it
was
as
if
some
one
walking
carried
a
light
but
so
fearful
was
columbus
lest
his
fervent
hopes
had
caused
him
to
imagine
this
light
that
he
would
not
trust
his
own
eyes
alone
so
he
called
to
one
of
his
officers
and
asked
him
if
he
saw
any
light
yes
replied
the
officer
i
see
a
light
then
columbus
called
a
second
man
he
could
not
at
first
see
the
light
and
in
any
case
neither
of
them
thought
much
of
it
columbus
however
made
sure
that
land
was
close
and
calling
the
men
about
him
he
bade
them
keep
a
sharp
promising
a
silken
doublet
to
the
man
who
should
first
see
land
so
till
two
in
the
morning
the
ships
held
on
their
way
then
from
the
pinta
there
came
again
a
joyful
shout
of
land
land
this
time
it
proved
no
vision
it
was
land
indeed
and
at
last
the
goal
was
reached
the
land
proved
to
be
an
island
covered
with
beautiful
trees
and
as
they
neared
the
shore
the
men
saw
naked
savages
crowding
to
the
beach
in
awed
wonder
these
savages
watched
the
huge
white
birds
as
the
ships
with
their
great
sails
seemed
to
them
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
and
when
they
reached
the
shore
and
folded
their
wings
the
natives
fled
in
terror
to
the
shelter
of
the
forest
but
seeing
that
they
were
not
pursued
their
curiosity
got
the
better
of
their
fear
and
returning
again
they
stood
in
silent
astonishment
to
watch
the
spaniards
land
first
of
all
came
columbus
over
his
glittering
steel
armour
he
wore
a
rich
cloak
of
scarlet
and
in
his
hand
he
bore
the
royal
standard
of
spain
then
each
at
the
head
of
his
own
ship
crew
came
the
captains
of
the
pinta
and
the
nina
each
carrying
in
his
hand
a
white
banner
with
a
green
cross
and
the
crowned
initials
of
the
king
and
queen
which
was
the
special
banner
devised
for
the
great
adventure
every
man
was
dressed
in
his
best
and
the
clothes
the
shining
armour
and
fluttering
banners
made
a
gorgeous
pageant
upon
it
the
sun
shone
in
splendour
and
the
blue
sky
was
reflected
in
a
bluer
sea
while
scarlet
flamingoes
startled
at
the
approach
of
the
white
men
rose
in
brilliant
flight
as
columbus
landed
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
kissed
the
ground
and
with
tears
of
joy
running
down
his
cheeks
he
gave
thanks
to
god
the
whole
company
following
his
example
then
rising
again
to
his
feet
columbus
drew
his
sword
and
solemnly
took
possession
of
the
island
in
the
name
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
crew
burst
forth
into
shouts
of
triumph
and
joy
they
crowded
round
columbus
kneeling
before
him
to
kiss
his
hands
and
feet
praying
forgiveness
for
their
insolence
and
mutiny
and
promising
in
the
future
to
obey
him
without
question
for
columbus
it
was
a
moment
of
pure
joy
and
triumph
all
his
long
years
of
struggle
and
waiting
had
come
to
a
glorious
end
yet
he
knew
already
that
his
search
was
not
finished
his
triumph
not
yet
complete
he
had
not
reached
the
eastern
shores
of
india
the
land
of
spice
and
pearls
he
had
not
even
reached
cipango
the
rich
and
golden
isle
but
he
had
at
least
he
thought
found
some
outlying
island
off
the
coast
of
india
and
that
india
itself
could
not
be
far
away
he
never
discovered
his
mistake
so
the
group
of
islands
nowhere
near
india
but
lying
between
the
two
great
continents
of
america
are
known
as
the
west
indies
columbus
called
the
island
upon
which
he
first
landed
san
salvador
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
thought
to
be
the
island
which
is
still
called
san
salvador
or
cat
island
but
lately
people
have
come
to
believe
that
columbus
first
landed
upon
an
island
a
little
further
south
now
called
watling
island
from
san
salvador
columbus
sailed
about
and
landed
upon
several
other
islands
naming
them
and
taking
possession
of
them
for
spain
he
saw
many
strange
and
beautiful
fruits
trees
of
a
thousand
sorts
straight
and
tall
enough
to
make
masts
for
the
largest
ships
of
spain
he
saw
flocks
of
gaily
coloured
parrots
and
many
other
birds
that
sang
most
sweetly
he
saw
fair
harbours
so
safe
and
spacious
that
he
thought
they
might
hold
all
the
ships
of
the
world
but
of
such
things
columbus
was
not
in
search
he
was
seeking
for
gold
and
jewels
and
at
every
place
he
touched
he
hoped
to
find
some
great
eastern
potentate
robed
in
splendour
and
seated
upon
a
golden
throne
instead
everywhere
he
found
only
naked
savages
they
were
friendly
and
gentle
and
what
gold
they
had
but
it
was
little
indeed
they
willingly
bartered
for
a
few
glass
beads
or
little
tinkling
bells
by
signs
however
some
of
these
savages
made
columbus
understand
that
further
south
there
was
a
great
king
who
was
so
wealthy
that
he
ate
off
dishes
of
wrought
gold
others
told
him
of
a
land
where
the
people
gathered
gold
on
the
beach
at
night
time
by
the
light
of
torches
others
again
told
him
of
a
land
where
gold
was
so
common
that
the
people
wore
it
on
their
arms
and
legs
and
in
their
ears
and
noses
as
ornaments
others
still
told
of
islands
where
there
was
more
gold
than
earth
but
columbus
sought
these
lands
in
vain
in
his
cruisings
columbus
found
cuba
and
thought
at
first
it
must
be
the
island
of
cipango
but
finding
himself
mistaken
he
decided
at
length
that
he
had
landed
upon
the
most
easterly
point
of
india
he
could
not
be
far
he
thought
from
the
palace
of
the
grand
khan
and
choosing
out
two
of
his
company
he
sent
them
as
ambassadors
to
him
but
after
six
days
the
ambassadors
returned
having
found
no
gold
and
instead
of
the
grand
khan
having
seen
only
a
savage
chieftain
these
ambassadors
found
no
gold
but
had
they
only
known
it
they
found
something
quite
as
valuable
for
they
told
how
they
had
met
men
and
women
with
firebrands
in
their
hands
made
of
herbs
the
end
of
which
they
put
in
their
mouths
and
sucked
blowing
forth
smoke
and
these
they
called
tabacos
the
spaniards
also
discovered
that
the
natives
of
these
islands
used
for
food
a
root
which
they
dug
out
of
the
earth
but
they
thought
nothing
of
these
things
for
what
were
roots
and
dried
herbs
to
those
who
came
in
search
of
gold
and
gems
and
precious
spices
so
they
brought
home
neither
potatoes
nor
tobacco
so
far
the
three
little
vessels
had
kept
together
but
now
the
captain
of
the
pinta
parted
company
with
the
others
not
because
of
bad
weather
says
columbus
in
his
diary
but
because
he
chose
and
out
of
greed
for
he
thought
that
the
indians
would
show
him
where
there
was
much
gold
this
desertion
grieved
columbus
greatly
for
he
feared
that
pinzon
might
find
gold
and
sailing
home
before
him
cheat
him
of
all
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
quest
but
still
the
admiral
did
not
give
up
but
steered
his
course
in
the
name
of
god
and
in
search
of
gold
and
spices
and
to
discover
land
so
from
island
to
island
he
went
seeking
gold
and
finding
everywhere
gentle
kindly
savages
fair
birds
and
flowers
and
stately
trees
chapter
how
columbus
returned
home
in
triumph
christmas
eve
came
and
the
admiral
being
very
weary
went
below
to
sleep
leaving
a
sailor
to
steer
the
ship
but
this
sailor
thought
he
too
would
like
to
sleep
so
he
gave
the
tiller
in
charge
of
a
boy
now
throughout
the
whole
voyage
the
admiral
had
forbidden
this
whether
it
was
stormy
or
calm
he
had
commanded
that
the
helm
was
never
to
be
entrusted
to
a
boy
this
boy
knew
very
little
of
how
to
steer
a
ship
and
being
caught
in
a
current
it
was
cast
upon
a
and
wrecked
by
good
luck
every
one
was
saved
and
landed
upon
the
island
of
haiti
but
columbus
had
now
only
one
little
vessel
and
it
was
not
large
enough
to
carry
all
the
company
many
of
them
however
were
so
delighted
with
the
islands
that
they
wanted
to
stay
there
and
they
had
often
asked
the
admiral
leave
to
do
so
columbus
therefore
now
determined
to
allow
some
of
his
men
to
remain
to
found
a
little
colony
and
trade
with
the
indians
and
he
trusted
in
god
that
when
he
came
back
from
spain
as
he
intended
to
do
he
would
find
a
ton
of
gold
collected
by
them
and
that
they
would
have
found
a
gold
mine
and
such
quantities
of
spices
that
the
sovereigns
would
in
the
space
of
three
years
be
able
to
undertake
a
crusade
and
conquer
the
holy
sepulchre
so
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
santa
maria
columbus
built
a
fort
and
from
the
many
who
begged
to
be
left
behind
he
chose
appointing
one
of
them
diego
de
arana
as
governor
he
called
the
fort
la
navida
or
the
nativity
in
memory
of
the
day
upon
which
it
was
founded
the
island
itself
he
called
espańola
or
little
spain
then
on
friday
the
of
january
the
nina
spread
her
sails
and
slowly
glided
away
leaving
in
that
far
island
amid
the
unknown
seas
the
first
colony
of
white
men
ever
settled
in
the
west
two
days
after
columbus
set
forth
upon
his
homeward
voyage
he
fell
in
again
with
the
pinta
the
master
had
found
no
gold
so
he
determined
to
join
columbus
once
more
he
now
came
on
board
and
tried
to
make
his
peace
with
columbus
but
the
admiral
received
him
coldly
for
he
had
little
faith
in
his
excuses
and
now
once
more
together
the
two
little
vessels
sailed
homeward
but
soon
storms
arose
the
ships
were
battered
by
wind
tossed
about
hither
and
thither
by
waves
and
at
length
separated
again
more
than
once
columbus
feared
that
his
tiny
vessel
would
be
engulfed
in
the
stormy
seas
and
the
results
of
his
great
enterprise
never
be
known
but
at
length
the
shores
of
portugal
were
sighted
and
on
friday
the
of
march
he
landed
again
at
palos
in
spain
from
whence
he
had
set
forth
more
than
seven
months
before
the
people
of
palos
had
hardly
hoped
to
see
again
those
who
had
sailed
away
on
so
desperate
an
adventure
now
when
they
saw
only
one
of
the
three
vessels
return
their
joy
was
mingled
with
grief
when
however
they
learned
that
columbus
returned
in
triumph
and
that
india
had
been
reached
their
joy
knew
no
bounds
shops
were
closed
bells
were
rung
and
all
the
people
in
holiday
attire
thronged
to
the
harbour
and
with
shouts
and
cheers
they
bore
columbus
in
triumph
to
the
church
there
to
give
thanks
to
god
for
his
safe
and
glorious
return
and
ere
the
shouts
had
died
away
a
second
vessel
was
seen
approaching
it
was
the
pinta
which
though
parted
from
the
nina
had
also
weathered
the
storms
and
now
came
safely
to
port
at
once
on
landing
columbus
had
sent
a
letter
to
the
king
and
queen
telling
them
of
his
return
now
he
received
an
answer
it
was
addressed
to
don
christopher
columbus
our
admiral
of
the
ocean
sea
viceroy
and
governor
of
the
islands
discovered
in
the
indies
it
bade
him
to
come
at
once
to
court
it
told
him
that
a
new
expedition
would
immediately
be
fitted
out
so
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
joy
and
pride
columbus
set
forth
to
barcelona
where
the
king
and
queen
then
were
the
great
news
of
his
voyage
and
discovery
had
outsped
him
and
the
people
of
barcelona
received
him
with
every
mark
of
respect
and
honour
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
riding
on
a
splendid
horse
and
surrounded
by
the
greatest
nobles
of
spain
they
cheered
him
again
and
again
they
gazed
in
wonder
also
at
the
savages
the
gaily
coloured
parrots
and
other
strange
things
he
had
brought
with
him
from
out
the
sea
of
darkness
sitting
on
a
throne
of
state
beneath
a
canopy
of
cloth
of
gold
with
the
young
prince
of
spain
beside
them
the
king
and
queen
received
columbus
at
his
approach
they
rose
and
standing
they
welcomed
back
to
their
realm
as
a
mighty
prince
he
who
had
gone
forth
a
simple
sailor
and
as
columbus
would
have
knelt
to
kiss
their
hands
they
raised
him
and
bade
him
be
seated
beside
them
as
an
equal
seldom
did
the
haughty
rulers
of
spain
show
such
great
honour
even
to
the
proudest
nobles
in
the
land
and
so
while
king
and
queen
and
courtiers
listened
breathlessly
columbus
told
of
all
he
had
done
of
all
the
marvels
he
had
seen
of
the
richness
and
fairness
of
the
lands
he
had
found
and
claimed
for
spain
and
when
he
had
finished
the
king
and
queen
fell
upon
their
knees
and
clasping
their
hands
they
raised
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
joy
to
heaven
giving
thanks
to
god
for
his
great
mercies
the
courtiers
too
fell
upon
their
knees
and
joined
their
prayers
to
those
of
the
king
and
queen
while
over
all
the
triumphant
notes
of
the
te
deum
rang
out
so
ended
the
great
voyage
of
columbus
he
had
shown
the
way
across
the
sea
of
darkness
he
had
proved
that
all
the
stories
of
its
monsters
and
other
dangers
were
false
but
even
he
had
no
idea
of
the
greatness
of
his
discovery
he
never
realised
that
he
had
shown
the
way
to
a
new
world
he
believed
to
the
day
of
his
death
that
he
had
indeed
found
new
islands
but
that
his
greatest
feat
was
that
of
finding
a
new
way
to
the
old
world
yet
now
being
made
a
noble
he
took
for
his
coat
of
arms
a
group
of
golden
islands
in
an
azure
sea
and
for
motto
the
words
to
castile
and
leon
columbus
gave
a
new
world
now
began
a
time
of
pomp
and
splendour
for
columbus
he
who
had
gone
forth
a
penniless
sailor
now
rode
abroad
in
gorgeous
array
often
he
might
be
seen
with
the
queen
on
one
hand
and
john
the
young
prince
of
spain
on
the
other
sometimes
even
the
king
himself
would
ride
with
him
and
seeing
him
so
high
in
royal
favour
all
the
greatest
and
proudest
nobles
of
the
land
were
eager
to
make
much
of
him
so
they
feted
him
flattered
him
and
spread
banquets
for
him
but
some
were
jealous
of
the
great
fame
of
columbus
and
they
made
light
of
his
discoveries
it
is
told
how
one
day
at
a
banquet
when
every
one
talked
of
these
wonderful
deeds
one
of
the
guests
spoke
slightingly
of
them
it
is
all
very
well
he
said
to
columbus
but
in
a
great
country
like
spain
where
there
are
such
numbers
of
daring
sailors
and
learned
folk
besides
many
another
man
might
have
done
the
same
as
you
we
should
have
found
the
indies
even
if
you
had
not
to
this
speech
columbus
answered
nothing
but
he
asked
for
an
egg
to
be
brought
to
him
when
it
was
brought
he
placed
it
on
the
table
saying
sirs
i
will
lay
a
wager
with
any
of
you
that
you
can
not
make
this
egg
stand
up
without
anything
at
all
to
support
it
one
after
the
other
they
tried
but
no
one
could
do
it
at
length
it
came
round
to
columbus
again
and
he
taking
it
in
his
hand
struck
it
sharply
on
the
table
so
that
one
end
was
chipped
a
little
and
it
stood
upright
that
my
lord
is
my
answer
he
said
looking
at
the
courtier
who
had
scoffed
and
all
the
company
were
silent
for
they
saw
he
was
well
answered
columbus
had
shown
that
after
a
deed
is
once
done
it
is
simple
and
every
one
knows
how
to
do
it
what
he
had
done
in
sailing
across
the
sea
of
darkness
was
only
wonderful
because
no
one
else
had
thought
of
doing
it
portugal
was
now
very
jealous
of
spain
success
and
king
ferdinand
of
spain
was
fearful
lest
king
john
of
portugal
should
seize
the
new
islands
which
columbus
had
discovered
so
he
appealed
to
the
pope
to
settle
the
matter
and
the
pope
decided
that
all
new
lands
discovered
west
of
an
imaginary
line
drawn
through
the
atlantic
ocean
west
of
the
azores
and
from
pole
to
pole
should
belong
to
spain
all
discoveries
east
of
this
line
should
belong
to
portugal
if
you
will
look
at
a
map
of
the
world
you
will
see
that
this
gave
to
spain
all
the
americas
with
their
islands
except
a
little
bit
of
brazil
and
to
portugal
the
whole
of
africa
but
almost
before
this
matter
was
settled
columbus
had
set
forth
again
on
another
voyage
across
the
great
ocean
now
no
longer
the
sea
of
darkness
this
time
he
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
company
for
every
one
was
eager
to
go
with
him
even
many
of
the
sons
of
great
nobles
this
time
too
the
passage
was
made
without
any
doubts
and
fears
but
with
joyful
expectations
columbus
had
hoped
great
things
of
the
little
colony
that
he
had
left
behind
him
but
when
he
cast
anchor
one
night
before
the
fort
his
heart
sank
all
was
dark
and
silent
on
shore
yet
still
hoping
he
ordered
two
cannon
to
be
fired
as
a
signal
to
the
colonists
the
cannon
boomed
through
the
still
warm
darkness
of
the
night
and
slowly
the
echoes
died
away
but
there
was
no
answer
save
the
sighing
of
the
sea
and
the
scream
of
the
startled
birds
from
the
fort
there
came
no
sound
or
any
sign
of
life
and
with
sad
forebodings
the
spaniards
waited
for
the
dawn
then
it
was
seen
that
the
fort
was
a
ruin
it
had
been
burned
and
sacked
torn
clothing
and
broken
vessels
were
strewn
around
but
as
the
spaniards
wandered
sadly
among
the
ruins
they
found
no
trace
of
their
companions
save
eleven
graves
with
the
grass
growing
above
them
at
first
no
natives
would
come
near
the
white
men
for
they
feared
their
anger
but
at
length
tempted
by
the
offer
of
gifts
and
other
friendly
signs
they
came
they
told
how
the
spaniards
had
quarreled
amongst
themselves
how
the
fort
had
been
attacked
by
unfriendly
indians
from
another
island
and
how
all
the
white
men
had
been
slain
thus
ended
the
first
white
colony
ever
planted
in
western
lands
all
traces
of
it
have
vanished
and
upon
the
spot
where
la
navida
stood
there
is
now
a
little
fishing
village
called
petit
anse
columbus
founded
other
colonies
but
they
succeeded
no
better
than
the
first
one
in
all
he
made
four
voyages
across
the
atlantic
and
in
the
third
he
landed
upon
the
coast
of
south
america
near
the
mouth
of
the
orinoco
but
columbus
did
not
know
that
at
last
he
had
discovered
the
great
double
continent
of
america
he
thought
that
he
had
merely
discovered
another
island
and
he
named
it
la
isla
santa
afterwards
he
was
so
delighted
at
the
beauty
of
the
land
that
he
thought
he
must
have
found
the
garden
of
eden
so
he
became
certain
that
he
had
landed
on
the
eastern
corner
of
asia
in
columbus
died
and
it
is
sad
to
think
that
he
who
by
his
great
faith
and
great
daring
led
the
way
across
the
sea
of
darkness
and
gave
a
new
world
to
the
old
died
in
poverty
and
neglect
the
men
who
had
wept
for
joy
at
the
news
of
his
discovery
shed
no
tear
over
his
grave
he
died
unwept
unhonoured
and
unsung
years
passed
before
men
recognised
what
a
great
man
had
dwelt
among
them
years
passed
before
any
monument
was
raised
to
his
memory
but
indeed
he
had
scarce
need
of
any
for
as
has
been
well
said
the
new
world
is
his
monument
and
every
child
of
the
new
world
must
surely
honour
that
monument
and
seek
never
to
deface
it
chapter
how
america
was
named
the
new
world
is
his
monument
and
yet
the
new
world
does
not
bear
the
name
of
columbus
so
in
this
chapter
i
am
going
to
tell
you
how
america
was
named
as
soon
as
columbus
had
shown
the
way
across
the
sea
of
darkness
many
were
eager
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
there
is
not
a
man
he
says
himself
down
to
the
very
tailors
who
does
not
beg
to
be
allowed
to
become
a
discoverer
among
the
many
who
longed
to
sail
the
seas
there
was
a
man
named
amerigo
vespucci
like
columbus
amerigo
vespucci
was
an
italian
he
was
born
in
florence
and
there
for
nearly
forty
years
he
lived
quietly
earning
his
living
as
a
clerk
in
the
great
merchant
house
of
medici
but
although
he
was
diligent
at
business
his
thoughts
were
not
wholly
taken
up
with
it
and
in
his
leisure
hours
he
loved
to
read
books
of
geography
and
pore
over
maps
and
charts
after
a
time
business
took
amerigo
to
spain
he
was
there
when
columbus
returned
from
his
famous
first
voyage
and
very
likely
saw
him
pass
through
the
streets
of
barcelona
on
his
day
of
triumph
just
when
amerigo
and
columbus
met
we
do
not
know
but
very
soon
we
find
amerigo
in
the
service
of
the
merchant
who
supplied
columbus
with
food
and
other
necessaries
for
his
second
voyage
it
has
been
thought
by
some
that
vespucci
went
with
columbus
on
this
voyage
but
that
is
not
very
likely
it
was
about
this
time
however
that
vespucci
went
on
his
first
voyage
in
which
he
explored
the
coast
of
venezuela
or
of
central
america
it
is
very
doubtful
which
before
going
on
this
voyage
he
had
been
in
spain
about
four
years
and
not
having
succeeded
very
well
as
a
merchant
he
decided
to
give
up
trading
and
take
to
a
sea
life
no
voyages
perhaps
have
been
more
written
about
and
fought
over
than
those
of
amerigo
vespucci
some
will
have
it
that
he
went
only
two
voyages
and
say
he
was
a
braggart
and
a
vainglorious
fool
if
he
said
he
went
more
others
think
that
he
went
at
least
four
voyages
and
probably
six
and
most
people
are
now
agreed
that
these
last
are
right
and
that
he
who
gave
his
name
to
the
great
double
continent
of
america
was
no
swaggering
pretender
but
an
honest
and
upright
man
in
the
first
two
voyages
that
he
made
vespucci
sailed
under
the
flag
of
spain
in
the
second
two
he
sailed
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
portugal
but
after
his
fourth
voyage
he
returned
again
to
spain
there
he
received
a
large
salary
and
the
rank
of
captain
later
he
was
made
pilot
major
of
spain
and
was
held
in
high
honour
till
his
death
yet
in
all
the
voyages
vespucci
went
whether
under
the
flag
of
portugal
or
of
spain
he
was
never
leader
he
went
as
astronomer
or
as
pilot
while
other
men
captained
the
expeditions
it
is
from
amerigo
letters
alone
that
we
gather
the
little
we
know
about
his
voyages
for
although
he
says
in
one
of
his
letters
that
he
has
written
a
book
called
the
four
voyages
it
has
never
been
found
and
perhaps
was
never
published
one
long
letter
however
which
he
wrote
to
an
old
schoolfellow
was
so
interesting
that
it
was
published
and
read
by
many
people
all
over
europe
it
was
says
an
old
english
writer
abrode
in
every
mannes
handes
amerigo
voyages
led
him
chiefly
to
central
and
south
america
and
he
became
convinced
that
south
america
was
a
continent
so
soon
what
with
the
voyages
of
vespucci
and
the
voyages
of
other
great
men
it
became
at
last
quite
certain
that
there
was
a
vast
continent
beyond
the
atlantic
ocean
therefore
began
to
draw
a
huge
island
large
enough
to
form
in
itself
a
continent
south
of
the
equator
they
called
it
the
new
world
or
the
land
of
the
holy
cross
but
the
northern
continent
was
still
represented
on
the
maps
by
a
few
small
islands
or
as
a
part
of
asia
thus
years
passed
daring
sailors
still
sailed
the
stormy
seas
in
search
of
new
lands
and
learned
men
read
the
tales
of
their
adventures
and
wrote
new
books
of
geography
then
one
day
a
professor
who
taught
geography
at
the
monastery
of
dié
in
alsace
published
a
little
book
on
geography
in
it
he
spoke
of
europe
asia
and
africa
the
three
parts
of
the
world
as
known
to
the
ancients
then
he
spoke
of
the
fourth
part
which
had
been
discovered
by
amerigo
vespucci
by
which
he
meant
what
we
now
call
south
america
and
continues
this
professor
i
do
not
see
what
is
rightly
to
hinder
us
calling
this
part
amerige
or
america
that
is
the
land
of
americus
after
its
discoverer
americus
this
is
the
first
time
the
word
america
was
ever
used
and
little
did
this
old
german
professor
writing
in
his
quiet
alsatian
college
think
that
he
was
christening
the
great
double
continent
of
the
new
world
and
as
little
did
amerigo
think
in
writing
his
letter
to
his
old
school
fellow
that
he
was
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
discoverer
of
the
new
world
at
first
the
new
name
came
slowly
into
use
and
it
appears
for
the
first
time
on
a
map
made
about
in
this
map
america
is
shown
as
a
great
island
continent
lying
chiefly
south
of
the
equator
all
the
voyages
which
columbus
had
made
had
been
north
of
the
equator
no
man
yet
connected
the
land
south
of
the
equator
with
him
and
it
was
at
first
only
to
this
south
land
that
the
name
america
was
given
thirty
years
and
more
went
by
many
voyages
were
made
and
it
became
known
for
certain
that
columbus
had
not
reached
the
shores
of
india
by
sailing
west
and
that
a
great
continent
barred
the
way
north
as
well
as
south
of
the
equator
then
a
famous
gave
the
name
of
america
to
both
continents
but
many
spaniards
were
jealous
for
the
fame
of
columbus
and
they
thought
that
the
northern
continent
should
be
called
colonia
or
columbiana
one
anxious
that
the
part
in
the
discovery
taken
by
ferdinand
and
isabella
should
not
be
forgotten
even
tried
to
make
people
call
it
but
all
such
efforts
were
in
vain
america
sounded
well
people
liked
it
and
soon
every
one
used
it
amerigo
vespucci
himself
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
choice
and
yet
because
others
gave
his
name
to
the
new
world
many
hard
things
have
been
said
of
him
he
has
been
called
in
scorn
a
land
lubber
a
beef
and
biscuit
contractor
and
other
contemptuous
names
even
one
of
the
greatest
american
writers
has
poured
scorn
on
him
strange
he
says
that
broad
america
must
wear
the
name
of
a
thief
amerigo
vespucci
the
pickle
dealer
of
seville
whose
highest
naval
rank
was
a
boatswain
mate
in
an
expedition
that
never
sailed
managed
in
this
lying
world
to
supplant
columbus
and
baptise
half
the
earth
with
his
own
dishonest
name
but
it
was
the
people
of
his
day
and
not
vespucci
who
brought
the
new
name
into
use
vespucci
himself
had
never
any
intention
of
being
a
thief
or
of
robbing
columbus
of
his
glory
he
and
columbus
had
always
been
friends
and
little
more
than
a
year
before
he
died
columbus
wrote
a
letter
to
his
son
diego
which
vespucci
delivered
in
this
letter
columbus
says
amerigo
vespucci
the
bearer
of
this
letter
has
always
been
wishful
to
please
me
he
is
a
very
honest
man
he
is
very
anxious
to
do
something
for
me
if
it
is
in
his
power
it
was
only
accident
which
gave
the
name
of
america
to
the
new
world
and
perhaps
also
the
ingratitude
of
the
great
leader
own
generation
later
generations
however
have
not
been
so
unmindful
of
columbus
and
his
deeds
americans
have
not
allowed
his
great
name
to
be
wholly
forgotten
the
district
in
which
the
capital
of
the
united
states
is

is
called
columbia

amerigo
vespucci
gave
his
name
to
the
great
double
continent
but
it
was
another
italian
john
cabot
who
first
landed
on
the
continent
of
north
america
like
columbus
cabot
was
born
in
genoa
when
however
he
left
his
own
land
he
did
not
go
to
spain
like
columbus
but
to
england
he
had
been
living
in
england
for
some
years
when
the
news
of
the
first
great
voyage
of
columbus
was
brought
there
soon
every
one
was
talking
about
the
wonderful
discovery
from
the
king
and
his
court
downward
cabot
was
a
trader
and
a
daring
sailor
well
used
to
sailing
on
the
stormy
seas
yet
even
he
was
awed
by
what
columbus
had
done
to
find
that
way
never
known
before
and
by
sailing
west
to
reach
the
east
where
the
spices
grow
seemed
to
him
a
thing
more
divine
than
human
and
he
too
longed
to
follow
columbus
and
maybe
discover
new
lands
king
henry
vii
was
eager
to
claim
new
lands
as
the
kings
of
spain
and
portugal
were
doing
so
he
listened
to
the
persuasions
of
john
cabot
and
in
spite
of
the
pope
who
had
divided
all
the
undiscovered
world
between
the
kings
of
spain
and
portugal
gave
him
leave
to
sail
forth
to
the
seas
of
the
east
and
west
and
north
and
to
plant
the
banner
of
england
upon
any
islands
countries
or
regions
belonging
to
heathens
or
infidels
which
he
might
discover
he
bade
his
john
cabot
take
five
ships
and
set
forth
on
the
adventure
at
his
own
proper
costs
and
charges
for
henry
was
a
king
wise
but
not
lavish
and
although
he
wanted
england
to
have
the
glory
of
new
discoveries
he
was
not
eager
to
spend
his
gold
on
them
but
where
could
a
poor
sailor
find
money
enough
for
so
great
an
adventure
so
a
year
went
past
and
although
cabot
had
the
king
leave
to
go
he
did
not
set
out
but
he
did
not
let
the
king
forget
and
at
length
henry
listened
to
the
busy
request
and
supplication
of
the
eager
sailor
and
consented
to
fit
out
one
small
ship
so
at
five
one
sweet
may
morning
a
frail
little
vessel
called
the
matthew
with
a
crew
of
but
eighteen
men
sailed
out
from
bristol
harbour
many
people
came
to
see
the
vessel
sail
for
they
were
nearly
all
bristol
men
who
were
thus
venturing
forth
on
the
unknown
deep
and
their
friends
crowded
to
the
harbour
to
wish
them
godspeed
it
was
a
great
occasion
for
bristol
and
indeed
for
all
england
for
it
was
the
first
voyage
of
discovery
with
which
the
english
king
and
people
had
to
do
so
the
tiny
whitesailed
ship
put
out
to
sea
followed
by
the
prayers
and
wishes
of
those
left
behind
with
eyes
they
watched
it
till
it
faded
from
view
then
they
turned
homewards
to
pray
for
the
return
of
their
loved
ones
round
the
coast
of
ireland
the
vessel
sped
but
at
last
its
green
shores
faded
from
sight
and
the
little
company
of
eighteen
brave
men
were
alone
upon
the
trackless
waves
westward
and
ever
westward
they
sailed
over
the
hazy
distance
beyond
the
sunset
rim
week
after
week
went
by
six
weeks
and
then
seven
and
still
no
land
appeared
those
were
days
of
anxiety
and
gloom
but
still
the
hope
of
the
golden
west
lured
cabot
on
and
at
length
one
day
in
june
he
heard
the
glad
cry
of
land
land
so
on
john
day
in
john
cabot
landed
somewhere
on
the
coast
of
america
he
called
the
land
prima
tierra
vista
or
first
land
seen
and
because
of
the
day
upon
which
it
was
found
he
called
an
island
near
to
it
john
isle
we
can
not
tell
exactly
where
cabot
east
anchor
it
may
have
been
at
cape
breton
or
somewhere
on
the
coast
of
labrador
but
wherever
it
was
that
he
landed
he
there
set
up
a
great
cross
and
unfurled
the
flag
of
england
claiming
the
land
for
king
henry
when
cabot
set
out
he
was
full
of
the
ideas
of
columbus
he
had
hoped
to
find
himself
on
the
coast
of
asia
and
in
the
land
of
gold
and
spices
now
he
knew
himself
mistaken
he
did
not
see
any
natives
but
he
knew
the
land
was
inhabited
for
he
found
notched
trees
snares
for
wild
animals
and
other
signs
of
habitation
which
he
took
home
he
had
found
no
golden
cities
he
had
had
speech
with
no
stately
potentate
yet
he
was
not
utterly
disappointed
for
the
country
he
had
found
seemed
to
him
fair
and
fertile
and
the
quantities
of
fish
which
swarmed
in
the
seas
amazed
both
himself
and
his
men
they
had
no
need
of
lines
or
even
of
nets
they
had
but
to
let
down
a
basket
weighted
with
a
stone
and
draw
it
up
again
to
have
all
the
fish
they
wanted
cabot
stayed
but
a
short
time
in
the
land
he
would
fain
have
stayed
longer
and
explored
further
but
he
feared
lest
his
provisions
would
give
out
and
so
regretfully
he
turned
homeward
great
was
the
excitement
in
bristol
when
the
tiny
ship
came
to
anchor
there
once
more
little
more
than
three
months
after
it
had
sailed
away
and
so
strange
were
the
tales
master
cabot
had
to
tell
that
the
folk
of
bristol
would
hardly
have
believed
him
for
he
was
a
poor
man
and
a
foreigner
had
not
his
crew
of
honest
bristol
men
vouched
for
the
truth
of
all
he
said
every
one
was
delighted
even
thrifty
king
henry
was
so
much
pleased
that
he
gave
cabot
it
seems
a
small
enough
sum
for
one
who
had
found
a
new
isle
but
we
must
remember
that
it
was
worth
more
than
would
be
worth
today
cabot
at
any
rate
found
it
enough
with
which
to
buy
a
suit
of
silk
and
dressed
in
this
new
splendour
he
walked
about
the
streets
of
bristol
followed
by
gaping
crowds
he
was
now
called
the
great
admiral
and
much
honour
was
paid
to
him
every
one
was
eager
to
talk
with
him
eager
to
go
with
him
on
his
next
voyage
and
that
even
although
they
knew
that
many
of
the
crew
would
be
thieves
and
for
the
king
had
promised
to
give
cabot
for
sailors
all
prisoners
except
those
who
were
confined
for
high
treason
we
know
little
more
of
john
cabot
later
king
henry
gave
him
a
pension
of
a
year
it
seems
likely
that
the
following
year
he
set
out
again
across
the
broad
atlantic
taking
his
sons
with
him
the
rest
is
silence
how
john
cabot
ended
his
life
where
he
lies
taking
his
rest
we
do
not
know
he
sleeps
somewhere
in
sod
unknown
without
a
slab
without
a
stone
we
remember
him
chiefly
because
he
was
the
first
to
lead
englishmen
across
the
atlantic
the
first
to
plant
the
flag
of
england
upon
the
continent
of
north
america
which
in
days
to
come
was
to
be
the
home
of
two
great
english
speaking
peoples

hopes
the
land
of

and
the
haughty
knights
of
spain
thirsting
for
gold
and
for
fame
were
lured
thither
they
sought
the
fabled
seven
cities
of
gold
they
sought
the
fountain
of
eternal
youth
through
the
dark
pathless
forests
across
the
wide
prairies
they
flashed
in
glittering
array
awaking
the
vast
silences
with
the
clash
of
arms
they
came
in

the
pomp
and
splendour
of
warfare
they
brought
also
the
cross
of
christ
threatening
the
heathen
with
death
if
they
did
not
bow
to
him
and
be
baptised
and
it
seemed
for
a
time
as
if
they
and
they
only
would
possess

continent
but
expedition
after
expedition
ended
in
disaster
the
spaniards
found
neither
the
seven
cities
nor
the
fountain
of
youth
and
the
redmen
instead
of
accepting
their
religion
hated
them
and
it
with
a
deep
hatred
but
the
spaniards
were
not
long
left
in
undisputed
possession
of
america
the
french
king
too
desired
to
have
new
lands
across
the
seas
and
he
saw
no
reason
why
spain
and

should
divide

would
fain
see

said
in

he
made
you
the
sole
heirs
to
so
vast
an
inheritance
until
i
do
see
that
i
shall
seize
as
mine
whatever
my
good
ships
may
find
upon
the

france
therefore
daring
men
sailed
forth
to
the
new
world
and
there
they
set
up
the
arms
of
their
country
claiming
broad
lands
for
their
king
and
now
came
the
time
when
all
christian
lands
were
torn
asunder
by
religious
strife
the
reformation
had
begun
and
everywhere
there
was
discord
between
the
people
who
followed
the
old
religion
and
those
who
followed
the
new
in
france
those
who
followed
the
new
religion
were
called
huguenots
they
were
often
hardly
used
and
were
denied
freedom
to
worship
god
in
their
own
way
many
of
them
therefore
longed
to
get
away
from
france
and
go
to
some
new
country
where
they
would
have
the
freedom
they
desired
so
a
few
grave
stern
men
gathered
together
and
determined
to
set
out
for
some
place
in
the
new
world
where
they
might
make
a
home
then
one
february
day
in
two
little
ships
sailed
away
from
france
westward
they
sailed
until
about
two
and
a
half
months
later
they
landed
in
what
is
now
florida
it
was
may
day
the
sun
shone
and
all
the
world
seemed
gay
and
green
and
these
protestant
adventurers
thought
they
had
never
seen
so
fair
a
land
it
was
they
said
the
fairest
fruitfullest
and
pleasantest
of
all
the
world
abounding
in
honey
venison
and
wildfowl
the
natives
were
friendly
and
told
the
newcomers
by
signs
that
the
seven
golden
cities
were
not
far
off
that
rejoiced
their
hearts
for
even
those
stern
old
huguenots
were
not
above
following
the
quest
for
gold
here
then
in
this
land
the
huguenots
set
up
a
stone
pillar
carved
with
the
arms
of
the
king
of
france
and
kneeling
round
it
they
gave
thanks
to
god
for
having
brought
them
to
so
fair
a
country
then
returning
to
their
ships
they
sailed
northward
along
the
coast
for
they
had
not
come
to
settle
but
merely
to
explore
and
find
out
a
good
spot
on
which
to
found
a
colony
but
the
land
seemed
so
fair
the
air
so
balmy
that
they
were
ready
to
settle
there
at
once
and
never
return
to
france
at
length
after
inspecting
several
places
the
adventurers
reached
a
spot
not
far
from
what
is
now
beaufort
in
south
carolina
here
they
landed
and
knowing
that
many
of
the
men
were
already
eager
to
remain
in
this
beautiful
country
jean
ribaut
their
leader
resolved
to
found
a
colony
so
he
called
them
all
together
and
speaking
wise
and
brave
words
to
them
asked
who
among
them
would
remain
declare
your
minds
freely
unto
me
he
said
and
remember
that
if
you
decide
to
remain
you
will
for
ever
be
famous
and
be
known
as
the
first
white
men
who
inhabited
this
land
ribaut
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
nearly
all
the
men
replied
with
a
shout
we
ask
nothing
better
than
to
remain
in
this
beautiful
country
indeed
so
many
were
anxious
to
remain
that
ribaut
had
enough
to
do
to
persuade
a
sufficient
number
to
man
the
ships
to
return
with
him
in
the
end
thirty
men
were
chosen
to
remain
at
once
they
set
about
building
a
fort
which
they
called
charlesfort
in
honour
of
the
boy
king
charles
ix
who
was
then
upon
the
throne
the
men
worked
so
well
that
in
a
very
few
days
the
fort
was
so
far
finished
that
it
was
fit
to
live
in
food
and
ammunition
were
brought
from
the
ships
and
a
man
named
albert
de
la
pierria
was
chosen
as
governor
then
for
the
last
time
ribaut
gathered
all
the
men
together
and
took
leave
of
those
to
be
left
behind
captain
albert
he
said
i
have
to
ask
you
in
the
presence
of
all
these
men
to
quit
yourself
so
wisely
in
your
charge
that
i
shall
be
able
to
commend
you
to
your
king
and
you
he
said
turning
to
the
soldiers
i
beg
you
to
esteem
captain
albert
as
if
he
were
myself
and
to
yield
to
him
that
obedience
that
a
true
soldier
owes
to
his
general
and
captain
i
pray
you
live
as
brethren
together
without
discord
and
in
so
doing
god
will
assist
you
and
bless
your
enterprises
then
farewells
were
said
and
ribaut
sailed
away
leaving
the
thirty
white
men
alone
in
the
wilderness
from
north
to
south
from
east
to
west
in
all
the
vast
continent
there
were
no
white
men
save
themselves
the
little
company
was
made
up
of
young
nobles
sailors
merchants
and
artisans
there
were
no
farmers
or
peasants
among
them
and
when
they
had
finished
their
fort
none
of
them
thought
of
clearing
the
land
and
sowing
corn
there
was
no
need
ribaut
would
soon
return
they
thought
bringing
with
him
all
they
required
so
they
made
friends
with
the
indians
and
roamed
the
forest
wilds
in
search
of
gold
and
of
adventures
without
care
for
the
future
but
the
days
and
weeks
passed
and
ribaut
did
not
return
for
when
he
arrived
home
he
found
that
france
was
torn
with
civil
war
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
ships
fitted
out
to
sail
to
america
soon
the
little
colony
began
to
feel
the
pangs
of
hunger
daily
they
scanned
the
pitiless
blue
sea
for
a
glimpse
of
ribaut
returning
sail
no
sail
appeared
and
daily
their
supplies
dwindled
away
had
it
not
been
for
the
friendly
redmen
they
might
all
have
perished
for
the
indians
were
generous
and
as
long
as
they
had
food
themselves
they
shared
it
with
their
white
friends
but
at
length
they
could
spare
no
more
indeed
they
had
already
given
the
so
much
food
that
they
themselves
they
said
would
be
forced
to
roam
the
woods
in
search
of
roots
and
herbs
to
keep
them
from
starving
until
harvest
was
ripe
they
told
the
frenchmen
however
of
two
rich
and
powerful
chiefs
who
held
sway
over
land
which
lay
to
the
south
where
they
might
obtain
endless
supplies
of
corn
and
vegetables
this
was
indeed
good
news
to
the
frenchmen
and
guided
by
their
indian
friends
they
lost
no
time
in
setting
out
to
beg
food
from
those
dusky
potentates
when
the
frenchmen
reached
the
wigwams
of
one
of
these
chiefs
they
were
received
with
great
honour
they
found
that
their
redskin
friends
had
spoken
truly
here
there
was
food
in
abundance
and
after
a
great
feast
they
returned
joyfully
to
the
fort
carrying
with
them
a
great
supply
of
corn
and
beans
and
what
was
still
better
a
promise
from
the
friendly
chief
that
he
would
give
them
more
food
whenever
they
had
need
of
it
once
more
the
colonists
rejoiced
in
plenty
but
not
for
long
for
the
very
night
they
arrived
home
their
storehouse
took
fire
and
all
the
food
which
they
had
brought
with
such
joy
was
destroyed
again
famine
stared
them
in
the
face
in
their
plight
they
once
more
appealed
to
the
savage
chief
who
supplied
their
wants
as
generously
as
before
promising
them
that
as
long
as
his
meal
should
last
they
should
never
want
so
for
the
time
being
the
colonists
were
saved
from
starvation
but
another
danger
now
threatened
them
for
quarrels
arose
among
the
men
albert
de
pierria
who
had
been
set
over
them
as
captain
proved
to
be
cruel
and
despotic
he
oppressed
the
men
in
many
ways
hanging
and
imprisoning
at
will
those
who
displeased
him
soon
the
men
began
to
murmur
under
his
tyranny
black
looks
greeted
albert
de
pierria
he
answered
them
with
blacker
deeds
at
length
one
day
for
some
misdeed
he
banished
a
soldier
to
a
lonely
island
and
left
him
there
to
die
of
hunger
this
was
more
than
the
colonists
could
well
bear
their
smouldering
anger
burst
forth
and
seizing
the
tyrant
they
put
him
to
death
then
they
chose
one
of
their
number
called
nicolas
barre
to
be
their
captain
they
were
rid
of
their
tyrant
and
that
brought
peace
for
a
time
to
the
little
colony
but
the
men
had
grown
to
hate
the
place
the
land
which
had
once
seemed
to
them
so
fair
now
seemed
no
better
than
a
prison
and
they
longed
to
escape
from
it
they
had
however
no
ship
and
although
all
around
them
tall
trees
grew
no
one
of
them
knew
anything
of
ship
building
still
so
strong
was
their
desire
to
leave
the
hated
spot
that
they
resolved
to
build
one
they
set
to
work
with
a
will
soon
the
sound
of
saw
and
hammer
awoke
the
silence
of
the
forest
high
and
low
noble
and
peasant
all
worked
together
the
indians
even
lending
a
hand
at
length
their
labours
were
over
and
the
rough
little
ship
was
afloat
it
made
but
a
sorry
appearance
the
planks
were
by
the
hatchet
and
caulked
with
the
moss
which
grew
in
long
streamers
on
the
trees
the
cordage
was
indian
made
and
the
sails
were
patched
together
from
shirts
and
bedclothes
never
before
had
men
thought
to
dare
the
ocean
waves
in
so
crazy
a
craft
but
the
colonists
were
in
such
eagerness
to
be
gone
that
they
chose
rather
to
risk
almost
certain
death
upon
the
ocean
than
remain
longer
in
their
vast
prison
house
so
they
loaded
the
ship
with
as
much
food
as
they
could
collect
and
saying
farewell
to
their
indian
friends
they
spread
their
patchwork
sails
and
glided
out
to
sea
drunken
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
returning
to
france
at
first
the
wind
blew
fair
and
the
little
ship
sped
gaily
homeward
then
came
a
calm
the
sun
burned
overhead
no
faintest
breeze
stirred
the
slack
sails
and
the
ship
lay
as
if
at
anchor
upon
the
glassy
waters
and
as
the
ship
lay
motionless
the
slender
stock
of
food
grew
less
and
less
soon
there
was
nothing
left
but
maize
and
little
of
that
at
first
a
tiny
handful
was
each
daily
portion
then
it
was
counted
by
grains
but
jealously
hoarded
although
it
was
the
maize
at
length
gave
out
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
eat
but
their
leather
shoes
and
jerkins
then
to
the
pain
of
hunger
was
added
the
pain
of
thirst
for
the
water
barrels
were
emptied
to
the
last
drop
unable
to
endure
the
torture
some
drank
the
sea
water
and
so
died
in
madness
beneath
the
burning
sun
every
timber
of
the
crazy
little
ship
warped
and
started
and
on
all
sides
the
sea
flowed
in
still
through
all
their
agony
the
men
clung
to
life
and
sick
with
hunger
maddened
with
thirst
as
they
were
they
laboured
unceasingly
bailing
out
the
water
but
they
laboured
now
with
despair
in
their
hearts
and
they
gave
up
hope
of
ever
seeing
their
beloved
france
again
then
at
length
the
pitiless
sun
was
overcast
a
wild
wind
arose
and
the
glassy
sea
whipped
to
fury
became
a
waste
of
foam
and
angry
billows
the
tiny
vessel
was
tossed
about
helplessly
and
buffeted
this
way
and
that
in
the
turning
of
a
hand
says
an
old
writer
the
waves
filled
their
vessel
half
full
of
water
and
bruised
it
upon
one
side
the
wretched
men
now
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
they
cared
no
longer
to
bail
but
cast
themselves
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
let
it
drift
where
it
would
only
one
man
among
them
did
not
utterly
lose
heart
he
set
himself
now
to
encourage
the
others
telling
them
that
if
only
the
wind
held
in
three
days
they
would
see
the
shores
of
france
this
man
was
so
full
of
hope
that
at
length
he
aroused
the
others
from
their
despair
once
more
they
began
the
weary
work
of
bailing
and
in
spite
of
all
the
fury
of
the
wind
and
waves
the
little
vessel
kept
afloat
at
last
the
storm
passed
once
more
the
fainting
wanderers
righted
their
vessel
and
turned
the
prow
towards
the
shores
of
france
but
three
days
passed
and
no
land
was
seen
and
they
became
more
despairing
than
before
for
now
the
last
grain
of
corn
was
eaten
the
last
drop
of
water
drunk
mad
with
thirst
sick
with
hunger
the
men
strained
their
weary
eyes
over
the
rolling
waste
of
waters
no
land
was
in
sight
then
a
terrible
thought
crept
into
one
mind
after
another
in
a
low
hoarse
whisper
one
man
and
then
another
spoke
out
his
one
man
should
die
for
his
fellows
so
deep
were
they
sunk
in
woe
that
all
were
of
one
mind
so
lots
were
cast
and
the
man
upon
whom
the
lot
fell
was
killed
these
tortured
wayfarers
had
become
cannibals
kept
alive
in
this
terrible
fashion
the
men
sailed
on
and
at
length
a
faint
grey
streak
appeared
on
the
horizon
it
was
the
shore
of
france
but
the
joy
was
too
great
for
their
minds
the
sight
of
land
seemed
to
rob
them
of
all
power
of
thought
or
action
with
salvation
in
sight
they
let
the
little
vessel
drift
aimlessly
this
way
and
that
while
they
thus
drifted
aimlessly
a
white
sail
hove
in
sight
and
an
english
vessel
bore
down
upon
them
in
the
english
vessel
there
happened
to
be
a
frenchman
who
had
sailed
with
ribaut
on
his
first
voyage
to
florida
he
soon
recognised
his
countrymen
in
spite
of
their
sorry
plight
and
they
were
brought
aboard
the
english
vessel
and
when
they
had
been
given
food
and
drink
and
were
somewhat
revived
they
told
their
tale
of
misery
the
englishmen
were
in
doubt
for
some
time
as
to
what
it
was
best
to
do
in
the
end
they
decided
to
set
the
most
feeble
on
the
shores
of
france
and
to
carry
the
others
prisoners
to
the
queen
of
england
who
at
that
time
was
about
to
send
an
expedition
to
florida
so
ended
the
first
attempt
of
the
french
to
found
a
colony
in
north
america
chapter
how
the
french
founded
a
colony
in
florida
two
years
after
ribaut
expedition
another
company
of
frenchmen
set
sail
for
america
this
time
reté
de
laudonničre
was
captain
he
had
been
with
ribaut
two
years
before
and
now
again
he
landed
on
the
same
spot
where
ribaut
had
first
landed
and
set
up
the
arms
of
france
as
they
saw
his
ship
come
the
indians
ran
down
to
the
beach
welcoming
him
with
cries
of
excitement
and
joy
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
the
chief
led
him
to
the
pillar
which
jean
ribaut
had
set
up
it
was
wreathed
in
flowers
and
baskets
of
corn
stood
before
it
for
the
indians
looked
upon
it
as
an
idol
and
made
offerings
to
it
they
kissed
it
with
a
great
show
of
reverence
and
begged
the
frenchmen
to
do
the
same
which
we
would
not
deny
them
says
laudonničre
who
himself
tells
the
story
to
the
end
we
might
draw
them
to
be
more
in
friendship
with
us
laudonničre
was
so
delighted
with
the
natives
friendly
greeting
that
he
resolved
to
found
his
colony
among
these
kindly
indians
so
a
little
way
up
the
river
which
ribaut
had
named
the
river
of
may
but
which
is
now
the
john
he
built
a
fort
it
was
late
one
evening
in
june
when
the
frenchmen
reached
the
spot
where
they
intended
to
build
the
fort
wearied
with
their
long
march
through
the
forest
they
lay
down
upon
the
ground
and
were
soon
fast
asleep
but
at
laudonničre
was
astir
he
commanded
a
trumpet
to
be
sounded
and
when
all
the
men
were
aroused
and
stood
together
he
bade
them
give
thanks
to
god
for
their
safe
arrival
so
standing
beneath
the
waving
palms
with
the
deep
blue
sky
arching
overhead
the
men
sang
a
psalm
of
thanksgiving
and
praise
then
kneeling
they
prayed
long
and
earnestly
the
prayer
ended
the
men
arose
and
full
of
happy
courage
turned
to
their
work
every
one
took
part
with
right
good
will
some
brought
earth
some
cut
logs
there
was
not
a
man
who
had
not
a
shovel
or
hatchet
or
some
tool
in
his
hand
the
work
went
on
merrily
and
soon
above
the
banks
of
the
river
the
fort
rose
secure
and
strong
fenced
and
entrenched
on
every
side
in
honour
of
their
king
charles
these
new
colonists
called
their
fort
caroline
just
as
ribaut
had
called
his
charlesfort
but
as
the
native
chief
satouriona
watched
the
fort
grow
he
began
to
be
uneasy
he
wondered
what
these
strangers
were
about
and
he
feared
lest
they
should
mean
evil
towards
him
so
he
gathered
his
warriors
together
and
one
day
the
frenchmen
looked
up
from
their
labours
to
see
the
heights
above
them
thick
with
savages
in
their
war
paint
at
once
the
frenchmen
dropped
their
tools
and
prepared
to
defend
themselves
but
satouriona
making
signs
of
peace
and
leaving
most
of
his
warriors
behind
him
came
down
into
the
camp
followed
by
a
band
of
twenty
musicians
who
blew
blasts
upon
discordant
pipes
having
reached
the
camp
satouriona
squatted
on
his
haunches
showing
that
he
wanted
to
take
counsel
with
the
frenchmen
then
with
many
signs
and
gestures
he
told
the
frenchmen
that
his
great
enemies
the
thimagoes
were
near
and
that
if
the
frenchmen
wished
to
continue
in
friendship
with
him
they
must
promise
to
help
him
against
these
powerful
and
hated
foes
laudonničre
feared
to
lose
satouriona
friendship
and
thereupon
with
signs
helped
out
now
and
again
with
a
word
or
two
a
treaty
was
made
between
the
indians
and
the
frenchmen
laudonničre
promising
to
help
satouriona
against
his
enemies
the
thimagoes
with
this
treaty
satouriona
was
delighted
and
he
commanded
his
warriors
to
help
the
frenchmen
in
building
their
fort
which
they
very
readily
did
then
mindful
of
his
promise
as
soon
as
the
fort
was
finished
laudonničre
sent
off
some
of
his
followers
under
one
of
his
officers
to
find
out
who
the
thimagoes
really
were
of
whom
satouriona
spoke
with
such
hate
guided
by
some
indians
this
officer
soon
came
upon
the
thimagoes
but
instead
of
fighting
with
them
he
made
friends
with
them
which
greatly
disgusted
his
indian
guides
meanwhile
satouriona
delighted
at
the
idea
of
being
able
to
crush
his
enemies
with
the
frenchmen
help
had
gathered
all
his
braves
together
and
made
ready
for
war
ten
chiefs
and
five
hundred
warriors
fearful
in
war
paint
and
feathers
gathered
at
the
call
then
seeing
that
laudonničre
was
not
making
any
preparations
for
war
he
sent
messengers
to
him
our
chief
has
sent
us
they
said
and
he
would
know
whether
you
will
stand
by
your
promise
to
show
yourself
a
friend
of
his
friends
an
enemy
of
his
enemies
and
go
with
him
to
war
tell
your
chief
replied
laudonničre
that
i
am
not
willing
to
purchase
his
friendship
with
the
enmity
of
another
notwithstanding
i
will
go
with
him
but
first
i
must
gather
food
for
my
garrison
neither
are
my
ships
ready
an
enterprise
such
as
this
needs
time
let
your
chief
abide
two
months
then
if
he
hold
himself
ready
i
will
fulfil
my
promise
to
him
the
indian
carried
this
answer
to
the
chief
who
when
he
heard
it
was
filled
with
wrath
he
was
not
however
to
be
stayed
from
war
and
he
determined
to
go
alone
with
great
ceremony
he
prepared
to
set
out
in
an
open
space
near
the
river
a
huge
fire
was
lit
in
a
wide
circle
round
this
the
warriors
gathered
their
faces
were
fearful
with
paint
and
their
hair
was
decorated
with
feathers
or
the
heads
of
wolves
and
bears
and
other
fierce
animals
beside
the
fire
was
placed
a
large
bowl
of
water
and
near
it
satouriona
stood
erect
while
his
braves
squatted
at
his
feet
standing
thus
he
turned
his
face
distorted
with
wrath
and
hatred
towards
the
enemy
country
first
he
muttered
to
himself
then
he
cried
aloud
to
his
god
the
sun
and
when
he
had
done
this
for
half
an
hour
he
put
his
hand
into
the
bowl
of
water
and
sprinkled
the
heads
of
his
braves
then
suddenly
as
if
in
anger
he
cast
the
rest
of
the
water
into
the
fire
putting
it
out
as
he
did
so
he
cried
aloud
so
may
the
blood
of
our
enemies
be
poured
out
and
their
lives
extinguished
in
reply
a
hoarse
yell
went
up
from
the
savage
host
and
all
the
woods
resounded
with
the
fiendish
noise
thus
satouriona
and
his
braves
set
forth
for
battle
in
a
few
days
they
returned
singing
praises
to
the
sun
and
bringing
with
them
prisoners
and
many
scalps
and
now
laudonničre
made
satouriona
more
angry
than
ever
with
him
for
he
demanded
two
of
these
prisoners
laudonničre
wanted
them
so
that
he
might
send
them
back
to
the
chief
of
the
thimagoes
as
a
proof
that
he
at
least
was
still
friendly
for
he
already
regretted
his
unwise
treaty
but
when
satouriona
heard
laudonničre
request
he
was
very
angry
and
treated
it
with
scorn
tell
your
chief
he
said
that
he
has
broken
his
oath
and
i
will
not
give
him
any
of
my
prisoners
when
laudonničre
heard
this
answer
he
in
his
turn
was
very
angry
and
he
resolved
to
frighten
satouriona
into
obeying
him
so
taking
twenty
soldiers
with
him
he
went
to
the
chief
village
leaving
some
of
the
soldiers
at
the
gate
and
charging
them
to
let
no
indians
go
in
or
out
he
went
into
satouriona
hut
with
the
others
in
perfect
silence
he
came
in
in
perfect
silence
he
sat
down
and
remained
so
for
a
long
time
which
says
laudonnčire
put
the
chief
deeply
in
the
dumps
at
length
when
he
thought
that
satouriona
was
completely
frightened
laudonničre
spoke
where
are
your
prisoners
he
said
i
command
them
to
be
brought
before
me
thereupon
the
chief
angry
at
the
heart
and
astonied
wonderfully
stood
a
long
time
without
making
any
answer
but
when
at
last
he
spoke
it
was
boldly
and
without
fear
i
can
not
give
you
my
prisoners
he
said
for
seeing
you
coming
in
such
warlike
guise
they
were
afraid
and
fled
to
the
woods
and
not
knowing
what
way
they
went
we
could
not
by
any
means
find
them
again
laudonničre
however
pretended
that
he
did
not
understand
what
the
chief
said
and
again
he
asked
for
the
prisoners
the
chief
then
commanded
his
son
to
go
in
search
of
them
and
in
about
an
hour
he
returned
bringing
them
with
him
as
soon
as
they
were
brought
before
laudonničre
the
prisoners
greeted
him
humbly
they
lifted
up
their
hands
to
heaven
and
then
threw
themselves
at
his
feet
but
laudonničre
raised
them
at
once
and
led
them
away
to
the
fort
leaving
satouriona
very
angry
laudonničre
now
sent
the
prisoners
back
to
the
thimagoes
chief
who
was
greatly
delighted
at
the
return
of
his
braves
he
was
still
more
delighted
when
the
frenchmen
marched
with
him
against
another
tribe
who
were
his
enemies
and
defeated
them
but
while
laudonničre
was
thus
making
both
friends
and
enemies
among
the
indians
all
was
not
peace
in
the
colony
itself
many
of
the
adventurers
had
grown
tired
of
the
loneliness
and
sameness
of
the
life
the
food
was
bad
the
work
was
hard
and
there
seemed
little
hope
that
things
would
ever
be
better
and
for
all
their
hardships
it
seemed
to
them
the
governor
was
to
blame
so
they
began
to
murmur
and
be
discontented
gathering
together
in
groups
whispering
that
it
would
be
a
good
deed
to
put
an
end
to
laudonničre
and
choose
another
captain
and
now
when
the
discontent
was
at
its
height
laudonničre
fell
then
one
of
the
ringleaders
of
the
discontent
urged
the
doctor
to
put
poison
in
his
medicine
but
the
doctor
refused
next
they
formed
a
plot
to
hide
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
under
his
bed
and
blow
him
up
but
laudonničre
discovered
that
plot
and
the
ringleader
fled
to
the
forest
about
this
time
a
ship
arrived
from
france
bringing
food
for
the
colony
so
that
for
a
time
things
went
a
little
better
and
when
the
ship
sailed
again
for
home
laudonničre
sent
the
worst
of
the
mutineers
back
in
it
in
their
place
the
captain
left
behind
some
of
his
sailors
but
this
proved
a
bad
exchange
for
these
sailors
were
little
better
than
pirates
and
very
soon
they
became
the
ringleaders
in
revolt
they
persuaded
some
of
the
older
colonists
to
join
them
and
one
day
they
stole
a
little
ship
belonging
to
the
colony
and
set
off
on
a
plundering
expedition
to
the
west
indies
on
the
seas
they
led
a
wild
and
lawless
life
taking
and
plundering
spanish
ships
but
after
a
time
they
ran
short
of
food
and
found
themselves
forced
to
put
into
a
spanish
port
here
in
order
to
make
peace
with
the
spaniards
they
told
all
they
knew
about
the
french
colony
thus
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
the
spaniards
learned
that
the
heretic
frenchmen
had
settled
in
their
land
and
speedily
the
news
was
sent
home
to
spain
meanwhile
laudonničre
was
greatly
grieved
for
the
loss
of
his
ship
and
as
days
passed
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
return
he
set
his
men
to
work
to
build
two
new
ships
for
a
time
the
work
went
well
but
soon
many
of
the
men
grew
tired
of
it
and
they
began
to
grumble
why
should
men
of
noble
birth
they
asked
slave
like
carpenters
and
day
by
day
the
discontent
increased
at
last
one
sunday
morning
the
men
sent
a
message
to
laudonničre
asking
him
to
come
out
to
the
parade
ground
to
meet
them
laudonničre
went
and
he
found
all
the
colony
waiting
for
him
with
gloomy
faces
at
once
one
of
them
stepped
forward
and
asked
leave
to
read
a
paper
in
the
name
of
all
the
others
laudonničre
gave
permission
the
paper
was
read
it
was
full
of
complaints
about
the
hard
work
the
want
of
food
and
other
grievances
it
ended
with
a
request
that
the
men
should
be
allowed
to
take
the
two
ships
which
were
being
built
and
sail
to
spanish
possessions
in
search
of
food
in
fact
they
wanted
to
become
pirates
like
those
mutineers
who
had
already
sailed
away
laudonničre
refused
to
listen
to
this
request
but
he
promised
that
as
soon
as
the
two
ships
were
finished
they
should
be
allowed
to
set
out
in
search
of
gold
mines
the
mutineers
separated
with
gloomy
faces
they
were
by
no
means
satisfied
with
laudonničre
answer
and
the
discontent
was
as
deep
as
ever
laudonničre
now
again
became
very
ill
and
the
malcontents
had
it
all
their
own
way
soon
nearly
every
one
in
the
fort
was
on
their
side
and
they
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
laudonničre
tyranny
late
one
night
about
twenty
men
all
armed
to
the
teeth
gathered
together
and
marched
to
laudonničre
hut
arrived
there
they
beat
loudly
on
the
door
demanding
entrance
but
laudonničre
and
his
few
remaining
friends
knew
well
what
this
loud
summons
meant
and
they
refused
to
open
the
door
the
mutineers
however
were
not
to
be
easily
held
back
they
forced
open
the
door
wounding
one
man
who
tried
to
hinder
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
with
drawn
swords
in
hand
and
angry
scowls
on
their
faces
they
crowded
round
the
sick
man
bed
then
holding
a
gun
at
his
throat
they
commanded
him
to
give
them
leave
to
set
forth
for
spanish
waters
but
the
stern
old
huguenot
knew
no
fear
even
with
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
against
his
throat
he
refused
to
listen
to
the
demands
of
the
lawless
crew
his
calmness
drove
them
to
fury
with
terrible
threats
and
more
terrible
oaths
they
dragged
him
from
his
bed
loading
him
with
fetters
they
carried
him
out
of
the
fort
threw
him
into
a
boat
and
rowed
him
out
to
the
ship
which
lay
anchored
in
the
river
all
the
loyal
colonists
had
by
this
time
been
disarmed
and
the
fort
was
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
mutineers
their
leader
then
drew
up
a
paper
giving
them
leave
to
set
forth
to
spanish
possessions
and
this
he
commanded
laudonničre
to
sign
laudonničre
was
completely
in
the
power
of
the
mutineers
he
was
a
prisoner
and
ill
but
his
spirit
was
unbroken
and
he
refused
to
sign
then
the
mutineers
sent
him
a
message
saying
that
if
he
did
not
sign
they
would
come
on
board
the
ship
and
cut
his
throat
so
seeing
no
help
for
it
laudonničre
signed
the
mutineers
were
now
greatly
delighted
at
the
success
of
their
schemes
they
made
haste
to
finish
the
two
little
ships
which
they
had
been
building
and
on
the
of
december
they
set
sail
as
they
went
they
flung
taunts
at
those
who
stayed
behind
calling
them
fools
and
dolts
and
other
scornful
names
and
threatening
them
with
all
manner
of
punishments
should
they
refuse
them
free
entrance
to
the
fort
on
their
return
as
soon
as
the
mutineers
were
gone
laudonničre
friends
rowed
out
to
him
set
him
free
from
his
fetters
and
brought
him
back
to
the
colony
they
were
now
but
a
very
small
company
but
they
were
at
peace
with
each
other
and
there
was
plenty
to
do
so
the
weeks
went
quickly
by
they
finished
the
fort
and
began
to
build
two
new
ships
to
take
the
place
of
those
which
the
mutineers
had
stolen
but
they
never
thought
of
tilling
the
ground
and
sowing
seed
to
provide
bread
for
the
future
thus
more
than
three
months
passed
then
one
day
an
indian
brought
the
news
that
a
strange
ship
was
in
sight
laudonničre
at
once
sent
some
men
to
find
out
what
ship
this
might
be
and
whether
it
was
friend
or
foe
it
proved
to
be
a
spanish
vessel
which
the
mutineers
had
captured
and
which
was
now
manned
by
them
but
the
mutineers
who
had
sailed
away
full
of
pride
and
insolence
now
returned
in
very
humble
mood
their
buccaneering
had
not
succeeded
as
they
had
hoped
they
were
starving
and
instead
of
boldly
demanding
entrance
and
putting
in
force
their
haughty
threats
they
were
eager
to
make
terms
but
laudonničre
was
not
sure
whether
they
really
came
in
peace
or
not
so
he
sent
out
a
little
boat
to
the
mutineers
ship
on
the
deck
of
it
there
was
an
officer
with
one
or
two
men
only
but
below
thirty
men
all
armed
to
the
teeth
were
hidden
seeing
only
these
one
or
two
men
in
the
boat
the
mutineers
let
her
come
alongside
but
what
was
their
astonishment
when
armed
men
suddenly
sprang
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
swarmed
over
the
sides
of
their
vessel
many
of
the
mutineers
were
stupid
with
drink
all
of
them
were
weak
with
hunger
and
before
they
could
seize
their
arms
or
make
any
resistance
they
were
overpowered
and
carried
ashore
there
a
was
held
and
four
of
the
ringleaders
were
condemned
to
death
but
these
bold
bad
men
were
loath
to
die
comrades
said
one
turning
to
the
loyal
soldiers
near
will
you
stand
by
and
see
us
die
thus
shamefully
these
replied
laudonničre
sharply
are
no
comrades
of
mutineers
and
rebels
all
appeals
for
mercy
were
in
vain
so
the
men
were
shot
and
their
bodies
hanged
on
gibbets
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
as
a
lesson
to
rebels
after
this
there
was
peace
for
a
time
in
fort
caroline
but
it
soon
became
peace
with
misery
for
the
colony
began
to
starve
the
ship
from
france
did
not
come
rich
and
fertile
land
spread
all
round
them
but
the
colonists
had
neither
ploughed
nor
sown
it
they
trusted
to
france
for
all
their
food
now
for
months
no
ships
had
come
and
their
supplies
were
utterly
at
an
end
so
in
ever
increasing
misery
the
days
passed
some
crawled
about
the
meadows
and
forest
digging
for
roots
and
gathering
herbs
others
haunted
the
river
bed
in
search
of
one
man
even
gathered
up
all
the
fish
bones
he
could
find
and
ground
them
to
powder
to
make
bread
but
all
that
they
scraped
together
with
so
much
pain
and
care
was
hardly
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
they
grew
so
thin
that
their
bones
started
through
the
skin
gaunt
spectres
they
lay
about
the
fort
sunk
in
misery
or
dragged
themselves
a
little
way
into
the
forest
in
search
of
food
unless
help
came
from
france
they
knew
that
they
must
all
soon
die
a
miserable
death
and
amid
all
their
misery
they
clung
to
that
last
hope
that
help
would
come
from
france
so
however
feeble
they
were
however
faint
with
hunger
they
would
crawl
in
turns
to
the
top
of
the
hill
above
the
fort
straining
their
dimming
eyes
seaward
but
no
sail
appeared
at
length
they
gave
up
all
hope
and
determined
to
leave
the
hated
spot
they
had
the
spanish
ship
which
the
mutineers
had
captured
and
another
little
vessel
besides
which
they
had
built
but
these
were
not
enough
to
carry
them
all
to
france
so
gathering
all
their
last
energy
they
began
to
build
another
boat
the
hope
of
getting
back
to
france
seemed
for
a
time
to
put
a
little
strength
into
their
famine
stricken
bodies
and
while
they
worked
laudonničre
sailed
up
the
river
in
search
of
food
but
he
returned
famishing
men
can
not
work
and
soon
the
colonists
began
to
weary
of
their
labours
the
neighbouring
indians
too
who
might
have
given
them
food
were
now
their
enemies
they
indeed
now
and
again
brought
scant
supplies
of
fish
to
the
starving
men
but
they
demanded
so
much
for
it
that
soon
the
colonists
were
bare
of
everything
they
had
possessed
they
bartered
the
very
shirts
from
their
backs
for
food
and
if
they
complained
of
the
heavy
price
the
indians
laughed
at
them
if
thou
makest
so
great
account
of
thy
merchandise
they
jeered
eat
it
and
we
will
eat
our
fish
but
summer
passed
the
grain
began
to
ripen
and
although
the
indians
sold
it
grudgingly
the
colony
was
relieved
from
utter
misery
for
the
time
being
but
now
fresh
troubles
arose
for
the
frenchmen
quarreled
with
the
chief
of
the
thimagoes
for
whose
sake
they
had
already
made
enemies
of
satouriona
and
his
indians
thinking
themselves
treated
in
an
unfriendly
manner
by
the
thimagoes
the
frenchmen
seized
their
chief
and
kept
him
prisoner
until
the
indians
promised
to
pay
a
ransom
of
large
quantities
of
grain
the
indians
agreed
only
because
they
saw
no
other
means
of
freeing
their
chief
they
were
furiously
angry
with
the
frenchmen
and
seething
with
indignation
against
them
they
refused
to
pay
an
ounce
of
grain
until
their
chief
had
been
set
free
and
even
then
they
would
not
bring
it
to
fort
caroline
but
forced
the
frenchmen
to
come
for
it
the
frenchmen
went
but
they
very
quickly
saw
that
they
were
in
great
danger
for
the
village
swarmed
with
armed
warriors
who
greeted
the
colonists
with
scowls
of
deepest
hatred
after
a
few
days
therefore
although
only
a
small
portion
of
the
ransom
had
been
paid
the
frenchmen
decided
to
make
for
home
as
fast
as
possible
it
was
a
hot
july
morning
on
which
they
set
off
each
man
besides
his
gun
carried
a
sack
of
grain
so
the
progress
was
slow
they
had
not
gone
far
beyond
the
village
when
a
wild
war
whoop
was
heard
it
was
immediately
followed
by
a
shower
of
arrows
the
frenchmen
replied
with
a
hot
fire
of
bullets
several
of
the
indians
fell
dead
and
the
rest
fled
howling
into
the
forest
then
the
frenchmen
marched
on
again
but
they
had
scarcely
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
another
war
whoop
was
heard
in
front
it
was
answered
from
behind
and
the
frenchmen
knew
themselves
surrounded
but
they
stood
their
ground
bravely
dropping
their
bags
of
corn
they
seized
their
guns
a
sharp
encounter
followed
and
soon
the
indians
fled
again
into
the
forest
but
again
and
again
they
returned
to
the
attack
and
the
frenchmen
had
to
fight
every
yard
of
the
way
at
nine
the
fight
began
and
the
sun
was
setting
when
at
length
the
indians
gave
up
the
pursuit
when
the
frenchmen
reached
their
boats
they
counted
their
losses
two
had
been
killed
and
injured
some
of
them
so
badly
that
they
had
to
be
carried
on
board
the
boats
of
all
the
bags
of
grain
with
which
they
had
started
out
only
two
remained
it
was
a
miserable
ending
to
the
expedition
the
plight
of
the
colony
was
now
worse
than
ever
the
two
sacks
of
grain
were
soon
consumed
the
feeble
efforts
at
building
a
ship
had
come
to
nothing
but
rather
than
stay
longer
the
colonists
resolved
to
crowd
into
the
two
small
vessels
they
had
and
sail
homeward
if
only
they
could
gather
food
enough
for
the
voyage
but
where
to
get
that
food
none
knew
one
day
full
of
troubled
anxious
thoughts
laudonničre
climbed
the
hill
and
looked
seaward
suddenly
he
saw
something
which
made
his
heart
beat
fast
and
brought
the
colour
to
his
wasted
cheeks
a
great
ship
its
sails
gleaming
white
in
the
sunlight
was
making
for
the
mouth
of
the
river
as
he
gazed
another
and
still
another
ship
hove
in
sight
thrilling
with
excitement
laudonničre
sent
a
messenger
down
to
the
fort
with
all
speed
to
tell
the
news
and
when
they
heard
it
the
men
who
had
seemed
scarce
able
to
crawl
arose
and
danced
for
joy
they
laughed
and
wept
and
cried
aloud
till
it
seemed
as
if
joy
had
bereft
them
of
their
wits
but
soon
fear
mingled
with
their
joy
there
was
something
not
altogether
familiar
about
the
cut
and
rig
of
the
ships
were
they
really
the
ships
from
france
or
did
they
belong
to
their
deadly
and
hated
enemies
the
spaniards
they
were
neither
one
nor
the
other
that
little
fleet
was
english
under
command
of
the
famous
admiral
john
hawkins
in
search
of
fresh
water
of
which
they
stood
much
in
need
the
english
admiral
at
once
showed
himself
friendly
to
prove
that
he
came
with
no
evil
intent
he
landed
with
many
of
his
officers
gaily
clad
and
wearing
no
arms
the
colonists
hailed
him
with
delight
for
it
seemed
to
them
that
he
came
as
a
deliverer
gravely
and
kindly
hawkins
listened
to
the
tale
of
misery
yet
he
was
glad
enough
when
he
heard
that
the
frenchmen
had
decided
to
leave
florida
for
he
wanted
to
claim
it
for
queen
elizabeth
and
england
when
however
he
saw
the
ships
in
which
they
meant
to
sail
homewards
he
shook
his
head
it
was
not
possible
he
said
for
so
many
souls
to
cross
the
broad
atlantic
in
those
tiny
barques
so
he
offered
to
give
all
the
frenchmen
a
free
passage
to
france
in
his
own
ships
this
laudonničre
refused
then
hawkins
offered
to
lend
him
or
sell
him
one
of
his
ships
even
this
kindness
laudonničre
hesitated
to
accept
thereupon
there
arose
a
great
uproar
among
the
colonists
they
crowded
round
him
clamouring
to
be
gone
threatening
that
if
he
refused
the
englishman
offer
they
would
accept
it
and
sail
without
him
so
laudonničre
yielded
he
told
hawkins
that
he
would
buy
the
ship
he
offered
but
he
had
no
money
the
englishman
however
was
generous
instead
of
money
he
took
the
cannon
and
other
things
now
useless
to
the
colonists
he
provided
them
with
food
enough
for
the
voyage
and
seeing
many
of
the
men
ragged
and
barefoot
added
among
other
things
fifty
pairs
of
shoes
then
with
kindly
good
wishes
hawkins
said
farewell
and
sailed
away
leaving
behind
him
many
grateful
hearts
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
the
frenchmen
began
to
prepare
to
depart
also
in
a
few
days
all
was
ready
and
they
only
waited
for
a
fair
wind
in
order
to
set
sail
but
as
they
waited
one
day
the
fort
was
again
thrown
into
a
state
of
excitement
by
the
appearance
of
another
fleet
of
ships
again
the
question
was
asked
were
they
friends
or
foes
spaniards
or
frenchmen
at
length
after
hours
of
sickening
suspense
the
question
was
answered
they
were
frenchmen
under
the
command
of
ribaut
the
help
had
come
at
last
it
had
come
when
it
was
no
longer
looked
for
when
it
was
indeed
unwelcome
to
many
for
the
colonists
had
grown
utterly
weary
of
that
sunlit
cruel
land
and
they
only
longed
to
go
home
france
with
any
amount
of
tyranny
was
to
be
preferred
before
the
freedom
and
the
misery
of
florida
but
to
abandon
the
colony
was
now
impossible
for
besides
supplies
of
food
the
french
ships
had
brought
many
new
colonists
this
time
too
the
men
had
not
come
alone
but
had
brought
their
wives
and
families
with
them
soon
the
fort
which
had
been
so
silent
and
mournful
was
filled
with
sounds
of
talk
and
laughter
again
the
noise
of
hatchet
and
hammer
resounded
through
the
woods
and
the
little
forsaken
corner
of
the
world
awoke
once
more
to
life
chapter
how
the
spaniards
drove
the
french
out
of
florida
scarcely
a
week
had
passed
before
the
new
peace
and
happiness
of
the
french
colony
was
brought
to
a
cruel
end
late
one
night
the
men
on
board
the
french
ships
saw
a
great
black
hulk
loom
silently
up
out
of
the
darkness
it
was
followed
by
another
and
another
no
word
was
spoken
and
in
eerie
silence
the
strange
ships
crept
stealthily
onwards
and
cast
anchor
beside
the
french
the
stillness
grew
terrible
at
length
it
was
broken
by
a
trumpet
call
from
the
deck
of
one
of
the
silent
then
a
voice
came
through
the
darkness
gentlemen
it
asked
whence
does
this
fleet
come
from
france
was
the
reply
what
are
you
doing
here
was
the
next
question
we
are
bringing
soldiers
and
supplies
for
a
fort
which
the
king
of
france
has
in
this
country
and
for
many
which
he
soon
will
have
are
you
catholics
or
lutherans
the
question
came
sharply
across
the
dark
water
it
was
answered
by
many
voices
we
are
lutherans
cried
the
french
we
are
of
the
new
religion
then
it
was
the
frenchmen
turn
to
ask
questions
who
are
you
i
they
cried
and
whence
come
ye
i
am
pedro
menendez
replied
the
voice
out
of
the
darkness
i
am
admiral
of
the
fleet
of
the
king
of
spain
and
i
am
come
into
this
country
to
hang
and
behead
all
lutherans
whom
i
may
find
by
land
or
by
sea
and
my
king
has
given
me
such
strict
commands
that
i
have
power
to
pardon
no
man
of
them
and
those
commands
i
shall
obey
to
the
letter
as
you
will
see
at
dawn
i
shall
come
aboard
your
ship
and
if
there
i
find
any
catholic
he
shall
be
but
every
heretic
shall
die
in
reply
to
this
speech
a
shout
of
wrath
went
up
from
the
frenchmen
if
you
are
a
brave
man
they
cried
why
wait
for
dawn
come
on
now
and
see
what
you
will
get
then
in
their
anger
they
heaped
insults
upon
the
spaniards
and
poured
forth
torrents
of
scoffing
words
thereupon
menendez
was
so
enraged
that
he
swore
to
silence
those
lutheran
dogs
once
and
for
ever
so
the
order
was
given
and
his
great
ship
slowly
moved
towards
the
french
the
threats
of
the
french
had
been
but
idle
boasting
they
could
not
withstand
the
spaniards
for
their
leader
was
ashore
with
most
of
his
soldiers
so
cutting
their
cables
they
fled
out
to
sea
pursued
by
the
foe
there
was
a
mad
chase
through
the
darkness
but
the
heretic
devils
as
the
spaniards
called
them
were
skilful
sailors
menendez
could
not
catch
them
and
when
day
dawned
he
gave
up
the
chase
and
moodily
turned
back
to
fort
caroline
here
he
found
the
french
ready
for
him
and
they
seemed
so
strong
that
he
would
not
attack
but
sailed
away
southwards
until
he
reached
the
river
of
dolphins
here
menendez
landed
and
took
possession
of
the
country
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
spain
while
cannon
boomed
and
trumpets
blew
he
stepped
on
shore
followed
by
his
officers
and
gentlemen
in
all
the
gay
trappings
of
knighthood
with
banners
fluttering
in
the
breeze
they
marched
then
as
they
advanced
another
procession
came
toward
them
at
the
head
of
it
was
a
priest
in
all
the
pomp
and
splendour
of
his
priestly
robes
he
carried
a
gilded
crucifix
in
his
hand
and
as
he
marched
he
sang
a
te
deum
when
the
two
processions
met
menendez
and
all
his
company
knelt
and
baring
their
heads
kissed
the
crucifix
so
was
the
land
claimed
for
spain
and
the
catholic
faith
and
augustine
the
oldest
town
in
the
united
states
was
founded
meanwhile
the
fleeing
french
ships
had
turned
followed
the
spaniards
and
seen
them
land
then
they
went
back
to
fort
caroline
with
the
news
while
these
things
had
been
happening
laudonničre
had
been
very
ill
he
was
still
in
bed
when
ribaut
followed
by
several
of
his
chief
officers
came
to
his
room
to
tell
him
the
news
which
the
returning
ships
had
just
brought
and
beside
his
sickbed
they
held
a
council
of
war
it
was
decided
to
attack
the
spaniards
and
drive
them
from
the
land
but
how
first
one
plan
and
then
another
was
discussed
and
to
each
some
one
objected
but
at
length
it
was
decided
to
go
by
sea
and
attack
the
spaniards
suddenly
in
their
fort
so
almost
every
man
who
could
hold
a
gun
set
forth
with
ribaut
and
laudonničre
was
left
in
the
fort
with
the
feeble
and
sick
and
scarcely
a
man
besides
who
had
ever
drawn
a
sword
or
fired
a
shot
their
leader
was
as
sick
and
feeble
as
any
of
them
but
he
dragged
himself
from
his
bed
to
review
his
forces
they
were
poor
indeed
but
laudonničre
made
the
best
of
them
he
appointed
each
man
to
a
certain
duty
he
set
a
watch
night
and
day
and
he
began
to
repair
the
walls
of
the
fort
so
that
they
would
be
able
to
make
some
show
of
resistance
in
ease
of
attack
while
laudonničre
was
thus
ordering
his
poor
little
garrison
the
ships
carrying
the
rest
of
the
colonists
sailed
on
their
way
the
wind
was
fair
and
in
the
night
they
crept
close
to
where
the
spanish
vessels
lay
but
when
day
dawned
and
the
spaniards
saw
the
french
vessels
close
to
them
they
fled
to
the
shelter
of
their
harbour
and
a
sudden
storm
arising
the
french
were
driven
out
to
sea
again
as
menendez
watched
them
from
the
shore
he
rejoiced
he
knew
by
the
number
of
the
ships
that
most
of
the
french
colonists
must
be
in
them
and
he
hoped
that
they
would
all
be
lost
in
the
storm
then
as
he
watched
a
sudden
thought
came
to
him
while
the
frenchmen
were
battling
with
wind
and
waves
he
resolved
to
move
quickly
over
land
and
take
fort
caroline
for
he
knew
that
it
must
be
almost
if
not
quite
unprotected
one
of
the
french
mutineers
who
had
deserted
laudonničre
was
now
in
the
spanish
fort
he
would
show
the
way
full
of
this
splendid
idea
eager
to
carry
it
out
at
once
he
ordered
mass
to
be
said
then
he
called
a
council
and
laid
his
plan
before
his
officers
they
however
met
his
eagerness
with
coldness
it
was
a
mad
and
hopeless
plan
they
thought
and
they
did
their
best
to
dissuade
menendez
from
it
but
menendez
was
determined
to
go
comrades
he
said
it
is
now
that
we
must
show
our
courage
and
our
zeal
this
is
god
war
and
we
must
not
turn
our
backs
upon
it
it
is
war
against
heretics
and
we
must
wage
it
with
blood
and
with
fire
but
the
spanish
leader
eager
words
awoke
no
response
in
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
they
answered
him
only
with
mutterings
still
menendez
insisted
the
debate
grew
stormy
and
angry
words
were
flung
this
way
and
that
at
length
however
menendez
had
his
way
the
clamour
was
stilled
the
officers
gave
a
grudging
consent
and
preparations
for
the
march
were
begun
in
a
few
days
all
was
ready
and
the
expedition
set
out
it
was
a
simple
matter
there
was
no
great
train
of
sumpter
mules
or
baggage
wagons
each
man
carried
his
own
food
and
ammunition
and
twenty
axemen
marched
in
front
of
the
little
army
to
cleave
a
way
through
the
forest
the
storm
still
raged
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
the
wind
howled
ceaselessly
as
on
and
on
the
men
trudged
they
plunged
through
seas
of
mud
and
grass
which
grew
waist
high
and
threaded
their
way
along
the
narrow
paths
cloven
for
them
by
the
axemen
so
for
three
days
they
toiled
onward
their
food
was
gone
their
ammunition
soaked
they
were
drenched
to
the
skin
footsore
and
famishing
when
upon
the
third
night
they
lay
down
upon
the
muddy
ground
cursing
their
leader
for
having
brought
them
forth
to
died
thus
miserably
but
while
the
men
cursed
menendez
prayed
all
night
he
prayed
and
before
day
dawned
he
called
his
officers
to
a
council
they
were
now
within
a
mile
of
fort
caroline
and
he
was
eager
to
attack
but
his
officers
were
sick
of
the
whole
business
the
men
were
utterly
disheartened
one
and
all
they
clamoured
to
return
yet
once
again
menendez
bent
them
to
his
will
in
the
darkness
of
the
forest
he
spoke
to
the
wretched
shivering
men
he
taunted
he
persuaded
and
at
length
wrung
from
them
a
sullen
consent
to
follow
him
so
once
again
the
miserable
march
was
begun
and
when
day
dawned
they
stood
on
the
hill
above
the
fort
no
sound
came
from
it
no
watchman
stood
upon
the
ramparts
for
towards
morning
seeing
that
it
rained
harder
than
ever
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
sent
his
men
to
bed
for
they
were
soaked
to
the
skin
and
he
was
sorry
for
them
in
such
rain
and
wind
what
enemy
would
venture
forth
he
asked
himself
it
was
folly
to
stay
abroad
on
such
a
night
he
thought
so
he
dismissed
the
guard
and
went
off
to
bed
thus
none
heard
or
saw
the
approach
of
the
spaniards
then
suddenly
the
silence
of
the
dawn
was
broken
with
fierce
war
cries
at
them
shouted
the
spaniards
god
is
with
us
the
sleeping
frenchmen
started
from
their
beds
in
terror
half
naked
they
sprang
to
arms
on
every
side
the
spaniards
poured
in
the
dim
light
of
dawn
showed
the
dark
cruel
faces
and
the
gleam
of
drawn
swords
then
clash
of
steel
screams
of
frightened
women
and
children
curses
prayers
all
mingled
together
in
terrible
confusion
at
the
first
alarm
laudonničre
sprang
from
his
bed
and
seizing
his
sword
called
his
men
to
follow
him
but
the
spaniards
surrounded
him
his
men
were
slain
and
scattered
and
he
himself
was
forced
back
into
the
yard
of
his
house
here
there
was
a
tent
this
stopped
his
pursuers
for
they
stumbled
over
the
cordage
and
became
entangled
with
it
the
confusion
gave
laudonničre
a
few
respite
in
which
he
escaped
through
a
breach
in
the
ramparts
and
took
refuge
in
the
forest
a
few
others
fleeing
this
way
and
that
escaped
likewise
but
some
the
first
moment
of
terror
past
resolved
to
return
and
throw
themselves
on
the
mercy
of
the
spaniards
rather
than
face
starvation
in
the
woods
they
are
men
said
one
it
may
be
when
their
fury
is
spent
they
will
spare
our
lives
even
if
they
slay
us
what
of
that
it
is
but
a
moment
pain
better
that
than
to
starve
here
in
the
woods
or
be
torn
to
pieces
by
wild
beasts
still
some
held
back
but
most
agreed
to
throw
themselves
upon
the
mercy
of
the
spaniards
so
unarmed
and
almost
naked
as
they
were
they
turned
back
to
give
themselves
up
but
little
did
these
simple
frenchmen
understand
the
fury
of
the
foe
when
they
neared
the
fort
the
spaniards
rushed
out
upon
them
and
unheeding
their
cries
for
mercy
slew
them
to
a
man
those
who
had
held
back
when
they
saw
the
fate
of
their
companions
fled
through
the
forest
some
sought
refuge
among
the
indians
but
even
from
that
refuge
the
spaniards
hunted
them
forth
and
slew
them
without
pity
thus
the
land
was
filled
with
bloodshed
and
ruin
many
were
slain
at
once
by
the
sword
others
were
hanged
on
trees
round
the
fort
and
over
them
menendez
wrote
i
do
this
not
as
to
frenchmen
but
as
to
lutherans
only
a
few
miserable
stragglers
after
untold
sufferings
reached
the
little
ship
which
still
lay
at
anchor
in
the
river
among
these
was
laudonničre
their
one
desire
now
was
to
flee
homewards
and
unfurling
their
sails
they
set
out
for
france
the
colony
of
fort
caroline
was
wiped
out
and
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
his
bold
scheme
menendez
marched
back
to
augustine
where
a
te
deum
was
sung
in
honour
of
this
victory
over
heretics
meanwhile
the
frenchmen
who
had
set
forth
to
attack
augustine
by
sea
had
been
driven
hither
and
thither
by
the
storm
and
at
length
were
wrecked
but
although
the
ships
were
lost
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
men
succeeded
in
reaching
the
shore
in
safety
and
not
knowing
what
had
happened
at
fort
caroline
they
set
out
in
two
companies
to
try
to
reach
the
fort
by
land
but
they
never
reached
the
fort
for
one
morning
scarcely
ten
days
after
the
destruction
of
fort
caroline
some
indians
came
to
menendez
with
the
news
that
they
had
seen
a
french
ship
wrecked
a
little
to
the
south
the
news
delighted
menendez
and
he
at
once
set
out
to
capture
the
shipwrecked
men
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
the
lights
of
the
french
camp
in
the
distance
but
on
coming
nearer
it
was
seen
that
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
an
arm
of
the
sea
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
reach
them
hiding
therefore
in
the
bushes
by
the
water
edge
menendez
and
his
men
watched
the
frenchmen
on
the
other
side
the
spaniards
soon
saw
that
their
enemies
were
in
distress
they
suspected
that
they
were
starving
for
they
could
be
seen
walking
up
and
down
the
shore
seeking
shellfish
but
menendez
wanted
to
make
sure
of
the
state
they
were
in
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
get
nearer
to
the
frenchmen
so
he
put
off
his
fine
clothes
and
dressing
himself
like
a
common
sailor
got
into
a
boat
and
rowed
across
the
water
seeing
him
come
one
of
the
frenchmen
swam
out
to
meet
him
as
he
drew
near
menendez
called
out
to
him
who
are
you
and
whence
come
ye
we
are
followers
of
ribaut
viceroy
of
the
king
of
france
answered
the
frenchman
are
you
catholics
or
lutherans
asked
menendez
we
are
lutherans
answered
the
man
then
after
a
little
more
talk
menendez
told
who
he
was
with
this
news
the
man
swam
back
to
his
companions
but
he
soon
returned
to
the
boat
to
say
that
five
of
the
french
leaders
wished
to
speak
with
the
spanish
leader
and
begged
for
safe
conduct
to
his
camp
to
this
menendez
readily
agreed
and
returning
to
his
own
side
he
sent
the
boat
back
to
bring
the
frenchmen
over
when
they
landed
menendez
received
them
courteously
and
after
returning
his
ceremonious
greetings
the
frenchmen
begged
the
spaniards
to
lend
them
a
boat
so
that
they
might
cross
the
river
which
lay
between
them
and
fort
caroline
at
this
request
menendez
smiled
evilly
gentlemen
he
said
it
were
idle
for
you
to
go
to
your
fort
it
has
been
taken
and
every
man
is
slain
but
the
frenchmen
could
not
at
first
believe
that
he
spoke
the
truth
so
in
proof
of
his
words
the
spanish
leader
bade
his
men
show
the
heretics
the
plunder
which
had
been
taken
from
their
fort
as
they
looked
upon
it
the
hearts
of
the
frenchmen
sank
then
ordering
breakfast
to
be
sent
to
them
menendez
left
them
and
went
to
breakfast
with
his
own
officers
breakfast
over
he
came
back
to
the
frenchmen
and
as
he
looked
at
their
gloomy
faces
his
heart
rejoiced
do
you
believe
now
he
asked
that
what
i
told
you
is
true
yes
replied
the
frenchmen
we
believe
it
would
be
useless
now
to
go
to
the
fort
all
we
ask
of
you
is
to
lend
us
ships
so
that
we
may
return
home
i
would
gladly
do
so
replied
menendez
if
you
were
catholics
and
if
i
had
ships
but
i
have
none
then
seeing
that
he
would
give
them
no
help
to
reach
home
the
frenchmen
begged
menendez
at
least
to
let
them
stay
with
his
people
until
help
came
to
them
from
france
it
was
little
enough
to
ask
they
thought
as
france
and
spain
were
at
peace
but
there
was
no
pity
or
kindliness
in
the
spanish
general
heart
all
catholics
he
replied
sternly
i
would
defend
and
succour
but
as
for
you
you
are
lutherans
and
i
must
hold
you
as
enemies
i
will
wage
war
against
you
with
blood
and
fire
i
will
wage
it
fiercely
both
by
land
and
sea
for
i
am
viceroy
for
my
king
in
this
country
i
am
here
to
plant
the
holy
gospel
in
this
land
that
the
indians
may
come
to
the
light
and
knowledge
of
the
holy
catholic
faith
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
as
taught
by
the
roman
church
give
up
your
banners
and
your
arms
and
throw
yourselves
on
my
mercy
and
i
will
do
with
you
as
god
gives
me
grace
in
no
other
way
can
you
have
truce
or
friendship
with
me
to
this
the
frenchmen
knew
not
what
to
say
first
they
consulted
together
then
some
of
them
went
back
across
the
water
to
take
counsel
with
those
who
waited
there
they
talked
long
and
anxiously
those
on
the
spanish
side
awaited
their
return
at
length
one
of
their
messengers
returned
and
going
to
menendez
he
offered
him
a
large
sum
of
money
if
he
would
swear
to
spare
their
lives
but
menendez
would
promise
nothing
the
frenchmen
were
helpless
they
were
starving
and
in
his
hands
and
both
he
and
they
knew
it
they
saw
no
hope
anywhere
so
they
yielded
to
the
spanish
demands
once
more
the
boat
was
sent
across
the
water
and
this
time
it
came
back
laden
with
banners
arms
and
armour
then
guarded
by
spanish
soldiers
the
frenchmen
were
brought
across
by
tons
as
each
batch
landed
they
found
themselves
prisoners
their
arms
were
taken
from
them
and
their
hands
were
tied
behind
their
backs
all
day
hour
after
hour
the
boat
plied
to
and
fro
and
when
all
the
frenchmen
had
been
brought
over
they
were
ordered
to
march
forward
the
spanish
general
walked
in
front
but
he
did
not
go
far
for
the
sun
was
already
setting
and
it
was
time
to
camp
for
the
night
so
but
a
little
way
from
the
shore
he
stopped
and
drew
a
line
in
the
sand
and
when
the
wretched
frenchmen
reached
that
line
weaponless
and
helpless
as
they
were
they
were
one
and
all
put
to
death
then
glorying
in
his
deed
menendez
returned
to
augustine
but
he
had
not
yet
completely
wiped
out
the
french
colony
for
besides
those
he
had
so
ruthlessly
slain
there
was
another
large
party
under
ribaut
who
ignorant
of
all
that
had
happened
were
still
slowly
making
their
way
to
fort
caroline
but
again
news
of
their
whereabouts
was
brought
to
menendez
by
indians
and
again
he
set
off
to
waylay
them
he
found
them
on
the
same
spot
as
he
had
found
the
first
party
but
this
time
the
frenchmen
had
made
a
raft
and
upon
this
they
were
preparing
to
cross
the
water
when
the
spaniards
came
upon
them
the
frenchmen
were
in
such
misery
that
many
of
them
greeted
the
appearance
of
their
enemies
with
joy
but
others
were
filled
with
misgiving
still
they
resolved
to
try
to
make
terms
with
the
spaniards
so
first
one
of
his
officers
and
then
ribaut
himself
rowed
across
the
strip
of
water
to
parley
with
the
spanish
leader
they
found
him
as
pitiless
as
their
companions
had
found
him
and
seeing
that
they
could
make
no
terms
with
him
many
of
the
frenchmen
refused
to
give
themselves
up
and
they
marched
away
but
after
much
parleying
and
many
comings
and
goings
across
the
river
ribaut
believing
that
menendez
would
spare
their
lives
yielded
up
himself
and
the
rest
of
his
company
to
the
spaniards
he
was
soon
undeceived
for
he
was
led
away
among
the
bushes
and
his
hands
were
tied
behind
his
back
as
his
followers
came
over
they
too
were
bound
and
led
away
then
as
trumpets
blew
and
drums
beat
the
spaniards
fell
upon
their
helpless
prisoners
and
slew
them
to
a
man
when
ribaut
saw
that
his
hour
was
come
he
did
not
flinch
we
are
but
dust
he
said
and
to
dust
we
must
return
twenty
years
more
or
less
can
matter
little
so
with
the
words
of
a
psalm
upon
his
lips
he
met
the
swordthrust
not
till
every
man
lay
dead
was
the
fury
of
the
spaniards
sated
then
his
horrible
labour
ended
menendez
returned
once
more
in
triumph
to
his
fort
those
of
the
french
who
had
refused
to
give
themselves
up
to
menendez
now
wandered
back
to
the
shore
where
their
ship
had
been
wrecked
out
of
the
broken
pieces
they
tried
to
build
a
ship
in
which
they
might
sail
homeward
but
again
news
of
their
doings
was
brought
to
menendez
by
the
indians
and
again
he
set
out
to
crush
them
when
the
frenchmen
saw
the
spaniards
come
they
fled
in
terror
but
menendez
sent
a
messenger
after
them
promising
that
if
they
yielded
to
him
he
would
spare
their
lives
most
of
them
yielded
and
menendez
kept
his
promise
he
treated
his
prisoners
well
but
when
an
opportunity
arrived
he
sent
them
home
to
end
their
lives
as
galley
slaves
chapter
how
a
frenchman
avenged
the
death
of
his
countrymen
when
the
news
of
these
terrible
massacres
reached
france
it
was
greeted
with
a
cry
of
horror
even
the
boy
king
charles
ix
catholic
though
he
was
demanded
redress
but
the
king
of
spain
declared
that
the
frenchmen
had
been
justly
served
the
land
upon
which
they
had
settled
was
his
he
said
and
they
had
no
right
to
be
there
he
was
sorry
that
they
were
frenchmen
but
they
were
also
pirates
and
robbers
and
had
received
only
the
just
reward
of
their
misdeeds
neither
charles
nor
his
mother
who
was
the
real
ruler
in
france
at
this
time
wished
to
quarrel
with
the
king
of
spain
so
finding
that
no
persuasions
would
move
him
and
that
instead
of
being
punished
menendez
was
praised
and
rewarded
they
let
the
matter
drop
but
there
was
one
man
in
france
who
would
not
thus
tamely
submit
to
the
tyranny
of
spain
his
name
was
dominique
de
gourges
he
hated
the
spaniards
with
a
deadly
hatred
and
when
he
heard
of
the
florida
massacre
he
vowed
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
countrymen
he
sold
all
that
he
had
borrowed
what
money
he
could
and
with
three
ships
and
a
goodly
company
of
soldiers
and
sailors
set
sail
at
first
however
he
kept
his
real
object
secret
instead
of
steering
straight
for
florida
he
steered
southward
making
believe
that
he
was
going
to
africa
for
slaves
but
after
encountering
storms
and
contrary
winds
he
turned
westward
and
when
off
the
coast
of
cuba
he
gathered
all
his
men
together
and
told
them
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
in
vivid
terrible
words
he
recounted
to
them
the
horrible
slaughter
shall
we
let
such
cruelty
go
unpunished
he
asked
what
fame
for
us
if
we
avenge
it
to
this
end
i
have
given
my
fortune
and
i
counted
on
you
to
help
me
was
i
wrong
no
they
all
cried
we
will
go
with
you
to
avenge
our
countrymen
so
with
hearts
filled
with
thoughts
of
vengeance
they
sailed
onward
to
fort
caroline
the
spaniards
had
repaired
the
fort
and
now
called
it
fort
mateo
they
had
also
built
two
small
forts
nearer
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
guard
the
entrance
to
it
now
one
afternoon
the
men
in
these
forts
saw
three
ships
go
sailing
by
these
were
the
french
ships
bringing
gourges
and
his
companions
but
the
men
in
the
forts
thought
that
they
were
spanish
ships
and
therefore
fired
a
salute
gourges
did
not
undeceive
them
he
fired
a
salute
in
reply
and
sailing
on
as
if
he
were
going
elsewhere
was
soon
lost
to
sight
at
length
having
found
convenient
place
out
of
sight
of
the
forts
he
drew
to
the
shore
but
when
he
would
have
landed
he
saw
that
the
whole
beach
was
crowded
with
savages
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
ready
for
war
for
the
indians
too
had
taken
the
strange
ships
to
be
spanish
and
as
they
had
grown
to
hate
the
spaniards
with
a
deadly
hatred
they
were
prepared
to
withstand
their
landing
fortunately
however
gourges
had
on
board
a
trumpeter
who
had
been
in
florida
with
laudonničre
so
now
he
sent
him
on
shore
to
talk
with
the
indians
and
as
soon
as
they
recognised
him
they
greeted
him
with
shouts
of
joy
then
they
led
him
at
once
to
their
chief
who
was
no
other
than
satouriona
laudonničre
friend
so
amid
great
rejoicings
the
frenchmen
landed
then
satouriona
poured
into
their
ears
the
tale
of
his
wrongs
he
told
them
how
the
spaniards
stole
their
corn
drove
them
from
their
huts
and
their
hunting
grounds
and
generally
them
not
one
peaceful
day
he
said
have
the
indians
known
since
the
frenchmen
went
away
when
gourges
heard
this
he
was
well
pleased
if
you
have
been
by
the
spaniards
he
said
the
french
will
avenge
you
at
this
satouriona
leaped
for
joy
what
he
cried
will
you
fight
the
spaniards
yes
replied
gourges
but
you
must
do
your
part
also
we
will
die
with
you
cried
satouriona
if
need
be
that
is
well
said
gourges
how
soon
can
you
be
ready
for
if
we
fight
we
should
fight
at
once
in
three
days
we
can
be
ready
said
the
indian
see
to
it
then
said
gourges
that
you
are
secret
in
the
matter
so
that
the
spaniards
suspect
nothing
have
no
fear
replied
satouriona
we
wish
them
more
ill
than
you
do
the
third
day
came
and
true
to
his
word
satouriona
appeared
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
warriors
fearful
in
paint
and
feathers
then
some
by
water
some
by
land
the
french
and
indians
set
forth
and
after
many
hardships
and
much
toil
they
reached
one
of
the
forts
which
the
spaniards
had
built
near
the
river
is
mouth
from
the
shelter
of
the
surrounding
trees
they
gazed
upon
it
there
cried
gourges
there
at
last
are
the
thieves
who
have
stolen
this
land
from
our
king
there
are
the
murderers
who
slew
our
countrymen
at
his
words
the
men
were
hardly
to
be
restrained
in
eager
whispers
they
begged
to
be
led
on
so
the
word
was
given
and
the
frenchmen
rushed
upon
the
fort
the
spaniards
had
just
finished
their
meal
when
a
cry
was
heard
from
the
ramparts
to
arms
to
arms
the
french
are
coming
they
were
taken
quite
unawares
and
with
but
short
resistance
they
fled
the
french
and
indians
pursued
them
and
hemmed
them
in
so
that
not
one
man
escaped
in
like
manner
the
second
fort
was
also
taken
and
every
man
slain
or
made
prisoner
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
gourges
spent
it
resting
and
making
preparations
to
attack
fort
mateo
when
the
spaniards
in
fort
mateo
saw
the
french
and
their
great
host
of
yelling
dancing
indians
they
were
filled
with
fear
and
in
order
to
find
out
how
strong
the
force
really
was
one
of
them
dressed
himself
as
an
indian
and
crept
within
the
french
lines
but
almost
at
once
he
was
seen
by
a
young
indian
chief
and
his
disguise
being
thus
discovered
he
was
seized
and
questioned
he
owned
that
there
were
scarce
three
hundred
men
in
the
fort
and
that
believing
the
french
to
number
at
least
they
were
completely
this
news
delighted
gourges
and
next
morning
he
prepared
to
attack
the
fort
was
easily
taken
when
the
spaniards
saw
the
french
attack
panic
seized
them
and
they
fled
into
the
forest
but
there
the
indians
mad
with
the
desire
of
blood
and
vengeance
met
them
many
fell
before
the
tomahawks
others
turned
back
choosing
rather
to
die
at
the
hands
of
the
french
than
of
the
indians
but
which
way
they
turned
there
was
no
escape
nearly
all
were
slain
a
few
only
were
taken
prisoner
when
the
fight
was
over
gourges
brought
all
the
prisoners
from
the
three
forts
together
he
led
them
to
the
trees
where
menendez
had
hanged
the
frenchmen
a
few
months
before
there
he
spoke
to
them
did
you
think
that
such
foul
treachery
such
abominable
cruelty
would
go
unpunished
he
said
nay
i
one
of
the
most
lowly
of
my
king
subjects
have
taken
upon
myself
to
avenge
it
there
is
no
name
shameful
enough
with
which
to
brand
your
deeds
no
punishment
severe
enough
to
repay
them
but
though
you
can
not
be
made
to
suffer
as
you
deserve
you
shall
suffer
all
that
an
enemy
may
honourably
inflict
thus
your
fate
shall
be
an
example
to
teach
others
to
keep
the
peace
and
friendly
alliance
which
you
have
broken
so
wickedly
and
having
spoken
thus
sternly
to
the
trembling
wretches
gourges
ordered
his
men
to
hang
them
on
the
very
same
trees
upon
which
menendez
had
hanged
the
frenchmen
and
over
their
heads
he
nailed
tablets
of
wood
upon
which
were
burned
the
words
not
as
spaniards
or
as
mariners
but
as
traitors
robbers
and
murderers
then
at
length
the
vengeance
of
gourges
was
satisfied
but
indeed
it
was
scarce
complete
for
menendez
the
chief
over
and
leader
of
the
spaniards
was
safe
in
europe
and
beyond
the
reach
of
any
private
man
vengeance
the
spaniards
too
were
strongly
entrenched
at
augustine
so
strongly
indeed
that
gourges
knew
he
had
not
force
enough
to
oust
them
he
had
not
even
men
enough
to
keep
the
three
forts
he
had
won
so
he
resolved
to
destroy
them
this
delighted
the
indians
and
they
worked
with
such
vigour
that
in
one
day
all
three
forts
were
made
level
with
the
ground
then
having
accomplished
all
that
he
had
come
to
do
gourges
made
ready
to
depart
whereupon
the
indians
set
up
a
wail
of
grief
with
tears
they
begged
the
frenchmen
to
stay
and
when
they
refused
they
followed
them
all
the
way
to
the
shore
praising
them
and
giving
them
gifts
and
praying
them
to
return
so
leaving
the
savages
weeping
upon
the
shore
the
frenchmen
sailed
away
and
little
more
than
a
month
later
they
reached
home
when
they
heard
of
what
gourges
had
done
the
huguenots
rejoiced
and
they
greeted
him
with
honour
and
praise
but
philip
of
spain
was
furiously
angry
he
demanded
that
gourges
should
be
punished
and
offered
a
large
sum
of
money
for
his
head
king
charles
too
being
in
fear
of
the
king
of
spain
looked
upon
him
coldly
so
that
for
a
time
he
was
obliged
to
flee
away
and
hide
himself
gourges
had
used
all
his
money
to
set
forth
on
his
expedition
so
for
a
few
years
he
lived
in
poverty
but
queen
elizabeth
at
length
heard
of
him
and
his
deeds
and
as
she
too
hated
the
spaniards
she
was
pleased
at
what
he
had
done
and
she
asked
him
to
enter
her
service
thus
at
length
he
was
restored
to
honour
and
favour
and
in
honour
and
favour
he
continued
all
the
rest
of
his
life
chapter
the
adventures
of
sir
humphrey
gilbert
the
terrible
disasters
in
florida
did
not
altogether
stop
french
adventurers
from
going
to
the
new
world
but
to
avoid
conflict
with
spain
they
sailed
henceforth
more
to
the
northern
shores
of
erica
and
endeavoured
to
found
colonies
there
this
made
englishmen
angry
for
by
right
of
cabot
voyages
they
claimed
all
america
from
florida
to
newfoundland
which
says
a
writer
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
they
bought
and
annexed
unto
the
crowne
of
england
the
english
therefore
looked
upon
the
french
as
interlopers
and
usurpers
the
french
however
paid
little
attention
to
the
english
claims
they
explored
the
country
named
mountains
rivers
capes
and
bays
and
planted
colonies
where
they
liked
thus
began
the
long
two
hundred
years
struggle
between
the
french
and
english
for
possession
of
north
america
the
french
had
already
planted
a
colony
on
the
lawrence
when
an
englishman
sir
humphrey
gilbert
determined
also
to
plant
one
in
north
america
he
was
the
first
englishman
ever
to
attempt
to
found
a
colony
in
america
many
englishmen
had
indeed
sailed
there
before
him
but
they
had
only
gone
in
quest
of
gold
and
of
adventures
and
without
any
thought
of
founding
a
new
england
across
the
seas
this
now
with
queen
elizabeth
permission
was
what
sir
humphrey
hoped
to
do
he
set
out
with
a
little
fleet
of
five
ships
one
of
these
was
called
the
raleigh
and
had
been
fitted
out
by
the
famous
sir
walter
raleigh
who
was
gilbert
walter
raleigh
no
doubt
would
gladly
have
gone
with
the
company
himself
but
he
was
at
the
time
in
high
favour
with
good
queen
bess
and
she
forbade
him
to
go
on
any
such
dangerous
expedition
so
he
had
to
content
himself
with
helping
to
fit
out
expeditions
for
other
people
the
raleigh
was
the
largest
ship
of
the
little
fleet
and
sir
walter
spared
no
cost
in
fitting
it
out
but
before
they
had
been
two
days
at
sea
the
captain
of
the
raleigh
and
many
of
his
men
fell
ill
this
so
greatly
discouraged
them
that
they
turned
back
to
plymouth
sir
humphrey
was
sad
indeed
at
the
loss
of
the
largest
and
ship
of
his
expedition
but
he
held
on
his
way
undaunted
they
had
a
troublous
passage
contrary
winds
fogs
and
icebergs
delayed
them
in
a
fog
two
of
the
ships
named
the
swallow
and
the
squirrel
separated
from
the
others
but
still
sir
humphrey
sailed
on
at
length
land
came
in
sight
but
it
was
a
barren
unfriendly
coast
nothing
but
hideous
rocks
and
mountains
bare
of
trees
and
void
of
any
green
herbs
says
one
who
went
with
the
expedition
and
seeing
it
so
uninviting
they
sailed
southward
along
the
coast
looking
for
a
fairer
land
and
now
to
their
great
joy
they
fell
in
again
with
the
swallow
the
men
in
the
swallow
were
glad
too
to
see
the
golden
hind
and
the
delight
once
more
they
threw
their
caps
into
the
air
and
shouted
aloud
for
joy
soon
after
the
of
the
swallow
the
squirrel
also
turned
up
so
the
four
ships
were
together
again
together
they
sailed
into
the
harbour
of
john
in
newfoundland
here
they
found
fishermen
from
all
countries
for
newfoundland
had
by
this
time
become
famous
as
a
and
every
summer
ships
from
all
countries
went
there
to
fish
sir
humphrey
armed
as
he
was
with
a
commission
from
queen
elizabeth
was
received
with
all
honour
and
courtesy
by
these
people
and
on
monday
august
he
landed
and
solemnly
took
possession
of
the
country
for
two
hundred
leagues
north
south
east
and
west
in
the
name
of
england
queen
first
his
commission
was
read
aloud
and
interpreted
to
those
of
foreign
lands
who
were
there
then
one
of
sir
humphrey
followers
brought
him
a
twig
of
a
hazel
tree
and
a
sod
of
earth
and
put
them
into
his
hands
as
a
sign
that
he
took
possession
of
the
land
and
all
that
was
in
it
then
proclamation
was
made
that
these
lands
belonged
to
her
majesty
queen
elizabeth
of
england
by
the
grace
of
god
and
if
any
person
shall
utter
words
sounding
to
the
dishonour
of
her
majesty
he
shall
lose
his
ears
and
have
his
ship
and
goods
confiscated
the
arms
of
england
engraved
on
lead
and
fixed
to
a
pillar
of
wood
were
then
set
up
and
after
prayer
to
god
the
ceremony
came
to
an
end
thus
newfoundland
became
an
english
possession
and
by
right
of
sir
humphrey
gilbert
claims
it
is
the
oldest
colony
of
the
british
empire
sir
humphrey
gilbert
had
taken
possession
of
the
land
but
it
soon
became
plain
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
found
a
colony
with
the
wild
of
the
sea
of
which
his
company
was
formed
troubles
began
at
once
a
few
indeed
went
about
their
business
quietly
but
others
spent
their
time
in
plotting
mischief
they
had
no
desire
to
stay
in
that
far
country
so
some
hid
in
the
woods
waiting
a
chance
to
steal
away
in
one
or
other
of
the
ships
which
were
daily
sailing
homeward
laden
with
fish
others
more
bold
plotted
to
steal
one
of
sir
humphrey
ships
and
sail
home
without
him
but
their
plot
was
discovered
they
however
succeeded
in
stealing
a
ship
belonging
to
some
other
adventurers
it
was
laden
with
fish
and
ready
to
depart
homeward
in
this
they
sailed
away
leaving
its
owners
behind
the
rest
of
sir
humphrey
men
now
clamoured
more
than
ever
to
be
taken
home
and
at
length
he
yielded
to
them
but
the
company
was
now
much
smaller
than
when
he
set
out
for
besides
those
who
had
stolen
away
many
had
died
and
many
more
were
sick
there
were
not
enough
men
to
man
all
four
ships
so
the
swallow
was
left
with
the
sick
and
a
few
colonists
who
wished
to
remain
and
in
the
other
three
sir
humphrey
put
to
sea
with
the
rest
of
his
company
he
did
not
however
sail
straight
homeward
for
he
wanted
to
explore
still
further
and
find
if
he
could
an
island
to
the
south
which
he
had
heard
was
very
fertile
but
the
weather
was
stormy
and
before
they
had
gone
far
the
delight
was
wrecked
and
nearly
all
on
board
were
lost
this
was
a
heavy
and
grievous
event
to
lose
at
one
blow
our
chief
ship
freighted
with
great
provision
gathered
together
with
much
travail
care
long
time
and
difficulty
but
more
was
the
loss
of
our
men
to
the
number
almost
of
a
hundred
souls
so
wrote
master
edward
hay
who
commanded
the
golden
hind
and
who
afterwards
wrote
the
story
of
the
expedition
after
this
heavy
chance
the
two
ships
that
remained
beat
up
and
down
tacking
with
the
wind
sir
humphrey
hoping
always
that
the
weather
would
clear
up
and
allow
him
once
more
to
get
near
land
but
day
by
day
passed
the
wind
and
waves
continued
as
stormy
as
ever
and
no
glimpse
of
land
did
the
weary
sailors
catch
it
was
bitterly
cold
food
was
growing
scarce
and
day
by
day
the
men
lost
courage
at
length
they
prayed
sir
humphrey
to
leave
his
search
and
return
homeward
sir
humphrey
had
no
wish
to
go
but
seeing
his
men
shivering
and
hungry
he
felt
sorry
for
them
and
resolved
to
do
as
they
wished
be
content
he
said
we
have
seen
enough
if
god
send
us
safe
home
we
will
set
forth
again
next
spring
so
the
course
was
changed
and
the
ships
turned
eastward
the
wind
was
large
for
england
says
hay
but
very
high
and
the
sea
rough
it
was
so
rough
that
the
squirrel
in
which
sir
humphrey
sailed
was
almost
swallowed
up
for
the
squirrel
was
only
a
tiny
frigate
of
ten
tons
and
seeing
it
battered
to
and
fro
and
in
danger
of
sinking
every
moment
the
captain
of
the
golden
hind
and
many
others
prayed
sir
humphrey
to
leave
it
and
come
aboard
their
boat
but
sir
humphrey
would
not
i
will
not
forsake
my
little
company
going
homeward
he
said
for
i
have
passed
through
many
storms
and
perils
with
them
no
persuasions
could
move
him
so
the
captain
of
the
golden
hind
was
fain
to
let
him
have
his
way
one
afternoon
in
september
those
in
the
golden
hind
watched
the
little
squirrel
anxiously
as
it
tossed
up
and
down
among
the
waves
but
sir
humphrey
seemed
not
a
whit
disturbed
he
sat
in
the
stern
calmly
reading
and
seeing
the
anxious
faces
of
his
friends
he
cheerfully
waved
his
hand
to
them
we
are
as
near
to
heaven
by
sea
as
by
land
he
called
through
the
roar
of
waves
then
the
sun
went
down
darkness
fell
over
the
wild
sea
and
the
ships
could
only
know
each
other
whereabouts
by
the
tossing
lights
suddenly
to
the
men
on
the
golden
hind
it
seemed
as
if
the
lights
of
the
little
frigate
went
out
immediately
the
watch
cried
out
that
the
frigate
was
lost
it
was
too
true
for
in
that
moment
the
frigate
was
devoured
and
swallowed
up
by
the
sea
yet
the
men
on
the
golden
hind
would
not
give
up
hope
all
that
night
they
kept
watch
straining
their
eyes
through
the
stormy
darkness
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
of
the
frigate
or
of
some
of
its
crew
but
morning
came
and
there
was
no
sign
of
it
on
all
the
wide
waste
of
waters
still
they
hoped
and
all
the
way
to
england
they
hailed
every
small
sail
which
came
in
sight
trusting
still
that
it
might
be
the
squirrel
but
it
never
appeared
of
the
five
ships
which
set
forth
only
the
golden
hind
returned
to
tell
the
tale
and
thus
ended
the
first
attempt
to
found
an
english
colony
in
the
new
world
chapter
about
sir
walter
raleigh
adventures
in
the
golden
west
the
first
attempt
to
found
an
english
colony
in
america
had
been
an
utter
failure
but
the
idea
of
founding
a
new
england
across
the
seas
had
now
taken
hold
of
sir
humphrey
young
walter
raleigh
and
a
few
months
after
the
return
of
the
golden
hind
he
received
from
the
queen
a
charter
very
much
the
same
as
his
brother
but
although
he
got
the
charter
raleigh
himself
could
not
sail
to
america
for
queen
elizabeth
would
not
let
him
go
so
again
he
had
to
content
himself
with
sending
other
people
it
was
on
april
that
his
expedition
set
out
in
two
small
ships
raleigh
knew
some
of
the
great
frenchmen
of
the
day
and
had
heard
of
their
attempt
to
found
a
colony
in
florida
and
in
spite
of
the
terrible
fate
of
the
frenchmen
he
thought
florida
would
be
an
excellent
place
to
found
an
english
colony
so
raleigh
ships
made
their
way
to
florida
and
landed
on
roanoke
island
off
the
coast
of
what
is
now
north
carolina
in
those
days
of
course
there
was
no
carolina
and
the
spaniards
called
the
whole
coast
florida
right
up
to
the
shores
of
newfoundland
the
englishmen
were
delighted
with
roanoke
it
seemed
to
them
a
fertile
pleasant
land
the
most
plentiful
sweete
fruitfull
and
wholesome
of
all
the
worlde
so
they
at
once
took
possession
of
it
in
the
right
of
the
queen
most
excellent
majesty
as
rightful
queen
and
princess
of
the
same
the
natives
too
seemed
friendly
and
in
their
behaviour
as
mannerly
and
civil
as
any
man
of
europe
but
the
and
the
redskins
found
it
difficult
to
understand
each
other
what
do
you
call
this
country
asked
an
englishman
win
gan
da
coa
answered
the
indian
so
the
englishmen
went
home
to
tell
of
the
wonderful
country
of
wingandacoe
but
what
the
indian
had
really
said
was
what
fine
clothes
you
have
however
the
mistake
did
not
matter
much
for
the
englishmen
now
changed
the
name
of
the
land
from
whatever
it
had
been
to
virginia
in
honour
of
their
queen
this
first
expedition
to
roanoke
was
only
for
exploring
and
after
a
little
the
adventurers
sailed
home
again
to
tell
of
all
that
they
had
seen
but
raleigh
was
so
pleased
with
the
report
of
roanoke
island
which
they
brought
home
to
him
that
he
at
once
began
to
make
plans
for
founding
a
colony
there
and
the
following
april
his
ships
were
ready
and
the
expedition
set
out
under
his
cousin
sir
richard
grenville
but
now
almost
as
soon
as
they
landed
troubles
began
with
the
indians
one
of
them
stole
a
silver
cup
and
as
it
was
not
returned
the
englishmen
in
anger
set
fire
to
the
and
destroyed
them
this
was
a
bad
beginning
but
the
englishmen
had
no
knowledge
yet
of
how
cruel
and
revengeful
the
redman
could
be
so
it
was
with
no
misgivings
that
sir
richard
left
a
colony
of
over
a
hundred
men
in
the
country
and
promising
to
return
with
fresh
supplies
in
the
following
spring
he
sailed
homeward
the
governor
of
this
colony
was
named
ralph
lane
he
was
wise
and
able
but
he
was
soon
beset
with
difficulties
he
found
that
the
place
chosen
for
a
colony
was
not
a
good
one
for
the
harbour
was
bad
the
coast
dangerous
and
many
of
the
indians
were
now
unfriendly
so
he
set
about
exploring
the
country
and
decided
as
soon
as
fresh
supplies
came
from
england
to
move
to
a
better
spot
spring
came
and
passed
and
no
ships
from
england
appeared
the
men
began
to
starve
and
seeing
this
the
indians
who
had
feared
them
before
now
began
to
be
scornful
and
taunt
them
your
god
is
not
a
true
god
they
said
or
he
would
not
leave
you
to
starve
they
refused
to
sell
the
colonists
food
no
matter
what
price
was
offered
their
hatred
of
the
english
was
so
great
indeed
that
they
resolved
to
sow
no
corn
in
order
that
there
should
be
no
harvest
being
ready
to
suffer
hunger
themselves
if
they
might
destroy
the
colony
utterly
as
the
days
passed
the
englishmen
daily
felt
the
pinch
of
hunger
more
and
more
then
lane
divided
his
company
into
three
and
sent
each
in
a
different
direction
so
that
they
might
gather
roots
and
herbs
and
catch
fish
for
themselves
and
also
keep
a
lookout
for
ships
but
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
the
savages
grew
daily
bolder
and
more
insolent
and
the
colonists
lived
constantly
in
dread
of
an
attack
from
them
at
length
although
he
had
tried
hard
to
avoid
it
lane
was
forced
to
fight
them
they
were
easily
overcome
and
fled
to
the
woods
but
lane
knew
well
that
his
advantage
was
only
for
the
moment
should
help
not
come
the
colony
would
be
wiped
out
then
one
day
about
a
week
after
the
fight
with
the
indians
news
was
brought
to
lane
that
a
great
fleet
of
ships
had
appeared
in
the
distance
were
they
friends
or
were
they
foes
that
was
the
great
question
the
english
knew
the
terrible
story
of
fort
caroline
were
these
spanish
ships
fearing
that
they
might
be
ralph
lane
looked
to
his
defenses
and
made
ready
to
withstand
the
enemy
if
enemy
they
proved
to
be
as
bravely
as
might
be
but
soon
it
was
seen
that
their
fears
were
needless
the
ships
were
english
and
two
days
later
sir
francis
drake
anchored
in
the
wretched
little
harbour
drake
had
not
come
on
purpose
to
relieve
the
colony
he
had
been
out
on
one
of
his
marauding
expeditions
against
the
spaniards
he
had
taken
and
sacked
domingo
cartagena
and
fort
augustine
and
now
sailing
home
in
triumph
chance
had
brought
him
to
colony
at
roanoke
and
when
he
saw
the
miserable
condition
of
the
colonists
and
heard
the
tale
of
their
hardships
he
offered
to
take
them
all
home
to
england
or
he
said
if
they
chose
to
remain
he
would
leave
them
a
ship
and
food
and
everything
that
was
necessary
to
keep
them
from
want
until
help
should
come
both
lane
and
his
chief
officers
who
were
men
of
spirit
wanted
to
stay
so
they
accepted
drake
offer
of
the
loan
of
a
ship
agreeing
that
after
they
had
found
a
good
place
for
a
colony
and
a
better
harbour
they
would
go
home
to
england
and
return
again
the
next
year
thus
the
matter
was
settled
drake
began
to
put
provisions
on
board
one
of
his
ships
for
the
use
of
the
colony
the
colonists
on
their
side
began
writing
letters
to
send
home
with
drake
ships
all
was
business
and
excitement
but
in
the
midst
of
it
a
great
storm
arose
it
lasted
for
four
days
and
was
so
violent
that
most
of
drake
ships
were
forced
to
put
out
to
sea
lest
they
should
be
dashed
to
pieces
upon
the
shore
among
the
ships
thus
driven
out
to
sea
was
that
which
drake
had
promised
to
give
ralph
lane
and
when
the
storm
was
over
it
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
so
drake
offered
another
ship
to
lane
it
was
a
large
one
too
large
to
get
into
the
little
harbour
but
the
only
one
he
could
spare
lane
was
now
doubtful
what
was
best
to
do
did
it
not
seem
as
if
by
driving
away
their
ship
god
had
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
them
from
thence
was
the
storm
not
meant
as
a
sign
to
them
so
not
being
able
to
decide
by
himself
what
was
best
to
do
lane
called
his
officers
and
gentlemen
together
and
asked
advice
of
them
they
all
begged
him
to
go
home
no
help
had
come
from
sir
richard
grenville
nor
was
it
likely
to
come
for
drake
had
brought
the
news
that
war
between
spain
and
england
had
been
declared
they
knew
that
at
such
a
time
every
englishman
would
bend
all
his
energies
to
the
defeat
of
spain
and
that
raleigh
would
have
neither
thoughts
nor
money
to
spare
for
that
colony
at
length
it
was
settled
that
they
should
all
go
home
in
haste
then
the
englishmen
got
on
board
for
drake
was
anxious
to
be
gone
from
the
dangerous
anchorage
which
caused
him
more
peril
of
wreck
says
ralph
lane
than
all
his
former
most
honourable
actions
against
the
spaniards
so
on
the
of
june
the
colonists
set
sail
and
arrived
in
england
some
six
weeks
later
they
brought
with
them
two
things
which
afterward
proved
to
be
of
wit
great
importance
the
first
was
tobacco
the
use
of
it
had
been
known
ever
since
the
days
of
columbus
but
it
was
now
for
the
first
time
brought
to
england
the
second
was
the
potato
this
raleigh
planted
on
his
estates
in
ireland
and
to
this
day
ireland
is
one
of
the
great
potato
growing
countries
of
the
world
but
meanwhile
raleigh
had
not
forgotten
his
colonists
and
scarce
a
week
after
they
had
sailed
away
a
ship
arrived
laden
with
all
manner
of
things
in
most
plentiful
manner
for
the
supply
and
relief
of
his
colony
for
some
time
the
ship
beat
up
and
down
the
coast
searching
vainly
for
the
colony
and
at
length
finding
no
sign
of
it
it
returned
to
england
about
a
fortnight
later
sir
richard
grenville
also
arrived
with
three
ships
to
his
astonishment
when
he
reached
roanoke
he
saw
no
sign
of
the
ship
which
he
knew
had
sailed
shortly
before
him
and
to
his
still
greater
astonishment
he
found
the
colony
deserted
yet
he
could
not
believe
that
it
had
been
abandoned
so
he
searched
the
country
up
and
down
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
of
the
colonists
but
finding
no
trace
of
them
he
at
length
gave
up
the
search
and
returned
to
the
forsaken
huts
and
being
unwilling
to
lose
possession
of
the
country
he
determined
to
leave
some
of
his
men
there
so
fifteen
men
were
left
behind
well
provided
with
everything
necessary
to
keep
them
for
two
years
then
sir
richard
sailed
homeward
in
spite
of
all
these
mischances
raleigh
would
not
give
up
his
great
idea
and
the
following
year
he
fitted
out
another
expedition
this
time
there
were
a
few
women
among
the
colonists
and
john
white
who
had
already
been
out
with
lane
was
chosen
as
governor
it
was
now
decided
to
give
up
roanoke
which
had
proved
such
an
unfortunate
spot
and
the
new
company
of
colonists
was
bound
for
chesapeake
bay
but
before
they
settled
there
they
were
told
to
go
to
roanoke
to
pick
up
the
fifteen
men
left
by
sir
richard
grenville
and
take
them
to
chesapeake
also
when
however
they
reached
roanoke
the
master
of
the
vessels
who
was
by
birth
a
spaniard
and
who
was
perhaps
in
league
with
the
spanish
said
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
year
to
go
seeking
another
spot
so
whether
they
would
or
not
he
landed
the
colonists
and
sailed
away
leaving
only
one
small
boat
with
them
thus
perforce
they
had
to
take
up
their
abode
in
the
old
spot
they
found
it
deserted
the
fort
was
razed
to
the
ground
and
although
the
huts
were
still
standing
they
were
choked
with
weeds
and
overgrown
with
wild
vines
while
deer
wandered
in
and
out
of
the
open
doors
it
was
plain
that
for
many
months
no
man
had
lived
there
and
although
careful
search
was
made
saving
the
bones
of
one
no
sign
was
found
of
the
fifteen
men
left
there
by
sir
richard
at
length
the
new
colonists
learned
from
a
few
friendly
indians
that
they
had
been
traitorously
set
upon
by
hostile
indians
most
of
them
were
slain
the
others
escaped
in
their
boat
and
went
no
man
knew
whither
the
englishmen
were
very
angry
when
they
heard
that
and
wanted
to
punish
the
indians
so
they
set
out
against
them
but
the
indians
fled
at
their
coming
and
the
englishmen
by
mistake
killed
some
of
the
friendly
indians
instead
of
their
enemies
thus
things
were
made
worse
instead
of
better
and
now
amid
all
these
troubles
on
the
of
august
a
little
girl
was
born
her
father
was
ananias
dare
and
her
mother
was
the
daughter
of
john
white
the
governor
the
little
baby
was
thus
the
of
the
governor
and
because
she
was
the
first
english
child
to
be
born
in
virginia
she
was
called
virginia
but
matters
were
not
going
well
in
the
colony
day
by
day
the
men
were
finding
out
things
which
were
lacking
and
which
they
felt
they
must
have
if
they
were
not
all
to
perish
so
a
few
days
after
virginia
was
christened
all
the
chief
men
came
to
the
governor
and
begged
him
to
go
back
to
england
to
get
fresh
supplies
and
other
things
necessary
to
the
life
of
the
colony
john
white
however
refused
to
go
the
next
day
not
only
the
men
but
the
women
also
came
to
him
and
again
begged
him
to
go
back
to
england
they
begged
so
hard
that
at
last
the
governor
consented
to
go
all
were
agreed
that
the
place
they
were
now
in
was
by
no
means
the
best
which
might
be
chosen
for
a
colony
and
it
had
been
determined
that
they
should
move
some
fifty
miles
further
inland
now
it
was
arranged
that
if
they
moved
while
the
governor
was
away
they
should
carve
on
the
trees
and
posts
of
the
door
the
name
of
the
place
to
which
they
had
gone
so
that
on
his
return
he
might
be
able
easily
to
find
them
and
also
it
was
arranged
that
if
they
were
in
any
trouble
or
distress
they
should
carve
a
cross
over
the
name
all
these
matters
being
settled
john
white
set
forth
and
it
was
with
great
content
that
the
colonists
saw
their
governor
go
for
they
knew
that
they
could
send
home
no
better
man
to
look
after
their
welfare
and
they
were
sure
he
would
bring
back
the
food
and
other
things
which
were
needed
but
when
white
arrived
in
england
he
found
that
no
man
not
even
raleigh
had
a
thought
to
spare
for
virginia
for
spain
was
making
ready
all
her
mighty
sea
power
to
crush
england
and
the
english
were
straining
every
nerve
to
meet
and
break
that
power
so
john
white
had
to
wait
with
what
patience
he
could
often
his
heart
was
sick
when
he
thought
of
his
daughter
and
his
little
granddaughter
virginia
dare
far
away
in
that
great
unknown
land
across
the
sea
often
he
longed
to
be
back
beside
them
but
his
longings
were
of
no
avail
he
could
but
wait
for
every
ship
was
seized
by
government
and
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
country
and
while
the
spaniards
were
at
the
gate
it
was
accounted
treason
for
any
englishman
to
sail
to
western
lands
so
the
summer
of
passed
the
autumn
came
and
at
length
the
great
armada
sailed
from
spain
it
sailed
across
the
narrow
seas
in
pride
and
splendour
haughtily
certain
of
crushing
the
insolent
sea
dogs
of
england
but
god
blew
with
his
breath
and
they
were
scattered
before
many
days
were
over
these
proud
ships
were
fleeing
before
the
storm
their
sails
torn
their
masts
splintered
they
were
shattered
upon
the
rocky
shores
of
scotland
and
ireland
they
were
swallowed
by
the
deep
the
sea
power
of
spain
was
broken
and
the
history
of
america
truly
began
for
as
has
been
said
the
defeat
of
the
invincible
armada
was
the
opening
event
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
free
now
from
the
dread
of
spain
ships
could
come
and
go
without
hindrance
but
another
year
and
more
passed
before
john
white
succeeded
in
getting
ships
and
provisions
and
setting
out
once
more
for
virginia
it
was
for
him
an
anxious
voyage
but
as
he
neared
the
place
where
the
colony
had
been
his
heart
rejoiced
for
he
saw
smoke
rising
from
the
land
it
was
dark
however
before
they
reached
the
spot
and
seeing
no
lights
save
that
of
a
huge
fire
far
in
the
woods
the
governor
sounded
a
trumpet
call
the
notes
of
the
trumpet
rang
through
the
woods
and
died
away
to
silence
there
was
no
answer
so
the
men
called
and
called
again
but
still
no
answer
came
then
with
sinking
heart
john
white
bade
them
sing
some
english
songs
for
that
he
thought
would
surely
bring
an
answer
from
the
shore
so
through
the
still
night
air
the
musical
sound
of
men
voices
rang
out
but
still
no
answer
came
from
the
silent
fort
with
a
heart
heavy
as
lead
the
governor
waited
for
the
dawn
as
soon
as
it
was
light
he
went
ashore
the
fort
was
deserted
grass
and
weeds
grew
in
the
ruined
houses
but
upon
a
post
in
fair
capital
letters
was
carved
the
word
croatoan
this
was
the
name
of
a
neighbouring
island
inhabited
by
friendly
indians
there
was
no
cross
or
sign
of
distress
carved
over
the
letters
and
when
the
governor
saw
that
he
was
greatly
comforted
he
spent
some
time
searching
about
for
other
signs
of
the
colonists
in
one
place
he
found
some
iron
and
lead
thrown
aside
as
if
too
heavy
to
carry
away
and
now
overgrown
with
weeds
in
another
he
found
five
chests
which
had
evidently
been
buried
by
the
colonists
and
dug
up
again
by
the
indians
they
had
been
burst
open
and
the
contents
lay
scattered
about
the
grass
three
of
these
chests
john
white
saw
were
his
own
and
it
grieved
him
greatly
to
see
his
things
spoiled
and
broken
his
books
were
torn
from
their
covers
his
pictures
and
maps
were
rotten
with
the
rain
and
his
armour
almost
eaten
through
with
rust
at
length
having
searched
in
vain
for
any
other
signs
of
the
colonists
the
english
returned
to
the
ships
and
set
sail
for
croatoan
but
now
they
encountered
terrible
storms
their
ships
were
battered
this
way
and
that
their
sails
were
torn
their
anchors
lost
and
at
length
in
spite
of
all
entreaties
the
captain
resolved
to
make
sail
for
england
so
john
white
never
saw
croatoan
never
knew
what
had
become
of
his
dear
ones
and
what
happened
to
little
virginia
dare
the
first
english
girl
to
be
born
on
the
soil
of
the
united
states
will
never
be
known
but
years
afterwards
settlers
were
told
by
the
indians
that
the
white
people
left
at
roanoke
had
gone
to
live
among
the
indians
for
some
years
it
was
said
they
lived
in
a
friendly
manner
together
in
time
however
the
medicine
men
began
to
hate
the
and
caused
them
all
to
be
slain
except
four
men
one
young
woman
and
three
boys
was
the
young
woman
perhaps
virginia
dare
no
one
can
tell
all
raleigh
attempts
at
founding
a
colony
had
thus
come
to
nothing
still
he
did
not
despair
once
again
he
sent
out
an
expedition
but
that
too
failed
and
the
leader
returned
having
done
nothing
even
this
did
not
break
raleigh
faith
in
the
future
of
virginia
i
shall
yet
live
to
see
it
an
english
nation
he
said
but
although
raleigh
faith
was
as
firm
as
before
his
money
was
gone
he
had
spent
enormous
sums
on
his
fruitless
efforts
to
found
a
colony
now
he
had
no
more
to
spend
and
now
great
changes
came
good
queen
bess
died
and
james
of
scotland
reigned
in
her
stead
raleigh
fell
into
disgrace
was
imprisoned
in
the
tower
and
after
a
short
release
was
beheaded
there
thus
an
end
came
to
all
his
splendid
schemes
never
before
perhaps
had
such
noble
devotion
to
king
and
country
been
so
basely
requited
at
the
time
it
was
said
that
never
before
was
english
justice
so
injured
or
so
disgraced
as
by
the
sentence
of
death
passed
upon
raleigh
no
man
is
perfect
nor
was
raleigh
perfect
but
he
was
a
great
man
and
although
all
his
plans
failed
we
remember
him
as
the
first
great
coloniser
the
first
englishman
to
gain
possession
of
any

he
was
a

and
patriot
but
he
was
a
dreamer
too
and
all
his

failed
other

failed

it

with

doggedness
they
went
on
trying
and
at
length
succeeded
raleigh
lay
in
the
tower
of
london
a
prisoner
accused
of
treason
all
his
lands
were
taken
from
him
virginia
which
had
been
granted
to
him
by
queen
elizabeth
was
the
king
once
more
to
give
to
whom
he
would
so
now
two
companies
were
formed
one
of
london
merchants
called
the
london
company
one
of
plymouth
merchants
called
the
plymouth
company
and
both
these
companies
prayed
king
james
to
grant
them
permission
to
found
colonies
in
virginia
virginia
therefore
was
divided
into
two
parts
the
right
to
found
colonies
in
the
southern
half
being
given
to
the
london
company
the
right
to
found
colonies
in
the
northern
half
being
given
to
the
plymouth
company
upon
condition
that
the
colonies
founded
must
be
one
hundred
miles
distant
from
each
other
these
companies
were
formed
by
merchants
they
were
formed
for
trade
and
in
the
hope
of
making
money
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
up
to
this
time
no
man
had
made
money
by
trying
to
found
colonies
in
america
but
on
the
contrary
many
had
lost
fortunes
of
the
two
companies
now
formed
it
was
only
the
london
company
which
really
did
anything
the
plymouth
company
indeed
sent
out
an
expedition
which
reached
virginia
but
the
colony
was
a
failure
and
after
a
year
of
hardships
the
colonists
set
sail
for
england
taking
home
with
them
such
doleful
accounts
of
their
sufferings
that
none
who
heard
them
ever
wished
to
help
to
found
a
colony
the
expedition
of
the
london
company
had
a
better
fate
it
was
in
december
that
the
little
fleet
of
three
ships
the
susan
constant
the
godspeed
and
the
discovery
put
out
from
england
and
turned
westward
towards
the
new
world
with
the
expedition
sailed
captain
john
smith
he
was
bronzed
and
bearded
like
a
turk
a
swaggering
longheaded
lovable
sort
of
man
ambitious
too
and
not
given
to
submit
his
will
to
others
since
a
boy
of
sixteen
he
had
led
a
wandering
adventurous
life
a
life
cramful
of
heroic
deeds
of
hairbreadth
escapes
of
which
we
have
no
space
to
tell
here
but
i
hope
some
day
you
will
read
his
own
story
of
these
days
for
he
was
a
writer
as
well
as
a
warrior
and
what
his
sword
did
his
pen
wrote
every
american
boy
and
girl
should
read
his
story
for
he
has
been
called
the
first
american
writer
now
with
this
saucy
swaggering
fellow
on
board
troubles
were
not
far
to
seek
the
voyage
was
long
and
tedious
for
six
weeks
adverse
winds
kept
the
little
fleet
prisoner
in
the
english
channel
within
sight
of
english
shores
a
thing
trying
to
the
tempers
of
men
used
to
action
and
burning
with
impatience
to
reach
the
land
beyond
the
seas
they
lay
idle
with
nothing
to
do
but
talk
so
they
fell
to
discussing
matters
about
the
colony
they
were
to
found
and
from
discussing
they
fell
to
disputing
until
it
ended
at
length
in
a
bitter
quarrel
between
smith
and
another
of
the
adventurers
captain
edward
wingfield
captain
wingfield
was
twice
john
smith
age
and
deemed
that
he
knew
much
better
how
a
colony
ought
to
be
formed
than
this
dictatorial
youth
of
he
himself
was
just
as
dictatorial
and
narrow
into
the
bargain
so
between
the
two
the
voyage
was
by
no
means
peaceful
good
master
hunt
the
preacher
who
went
with
the
expedition
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
so
weak
and
ill
that
few
thought
he
would
live
did
his
best
to
still
the
angry
passions
to
some
extent
he
succeeded
and
when
a
fair
wind
blew
at
length
the
ships
spread
their
sails
to
it
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
of
england
two
months
of
storm
and
danger
passed
before
the
adventurers
sighted
the
west
indies
here
they
went
ashore
on
the
island
of
san
dominica
delighted
once
more
to
see
land
and
escape
from
the
confinement
of
the
ship
they
stayed
three
weeks
among
the
sunny
islands
they
hunted
and
fished
traded
with
the
savages
boiled
pork
in
hot
natural
springs
feasted
on
fresh
food
and
vegetables
and
generally
enjoyed
themselves
but
among
all
this
wingfield
did
not
forget
his
anger
against
john
smith
their
quarrels
became
so
bad
that
wingfield
decided
to
end
both
quarrels
and
john
smith
so
he
ordered
a
gallows
to
be
set
up
and
having
accused
smith
of
mutiny
made
ready
to
hang
him
but
john
smith
stoutly
defended
himself
nothing
could
be
proved
against
him
he
laughed
at
the
gallows
and
as
he
quaintly
puts
it
could
not
be
persuaded
to
use
them
nevertheless
although
nothing
could
be
proved
against
him
there
were
many
who
quite
agreed
that
captain
john
smith
was
a
turbulent
fellow
so
to
keep
him
quiet
they
clapped
him
in
irons
and
kept
him
so
until
their
arrival
in
virginia
after
leaving
the
west
indies
the
adventurers
fell
into
more
bad
weather
and
lost
their
course
but
finally
they
arrived
safely
in
chesapeake
bay
they
named
the
capes
on
either
side
henry
and
charles
in
honour
of
the
two
sons
of
their
king
upon
cape
henry
they
set
up
a
brass
cross
upon
which
was
carved
jacobus
rex
and
thus
claimed
the
land
for
england
then
they
sailed
on
up
the
river
which
they
named
james
river
in
honour
of
the
king
himself
their
settlement
they
named
jamestown
also
in
his
honour
jamestown
has
now
disappeared
but
the
two
capes
and
the
river
are
still
called
by
the
names
given
them
by
these
early
settlers
before
this
expedition
sailed
the
directors
of
the
company
had
arranged
who
among
the
colonists
were
to
be
the
rulers
but
for
some
quaint
reason
they
were
not
told
their
names
together
with
many
instructions
as
to
what
they
were
to
do
were
put
into
a
sealed
box
and
orders
were
given
that
this
box
was
not
to
be
opened
until
virginia
was
reached
the
box
was
now
opened
and
it
was
found
that
john
smith
was
named
among
the
seven
who
were
to
form
the
council
the
others
were
much
disgusted
at
this
and
in
spite
of
all
he
could
say
they
refused
to
have
him
in
the
council
they
did
however
set
him
free
from
his
fetters
of
the
council
wingfield
was
chosen
president
all
the
others
except
john
smith
took
oath
to
do
their
best
for
the
colony
then
at
once
the
business
of
building
houses
was
begun
while
the
council
drew
plans
the
men
dug
trenches
and
felled
trees
in
order
to
clear
space
on
which
to
pitch
their
tents
or
otherwise
busied
themselves
about
the
settlement
the
indians
appeared
to
be
friendly
and
often
came
to
look
on
curiously
at
these
strange
doings
and
wingfield
thought
them
so
gentle
and
kindly
that
he
would
not
allow
the
men
to
build
any
fortifications
except
a
sort
of
screen
of
interwoven
boughs
besides
building
houses
one
of
the
colonists
first
cares
was
to
provide
themselves
with
a
church
but
indeed
it
was
one
of
the
quaintest
churches
ever
known
an
old
sail
was
stretched
beneath
a
group
of
trees
to
give
shelter
from
the
burning
sun
and
to
make
a
pulpit
a
plank
of
wood
was
nailed
between
two
trees
which
grew
near
together
and
here
good
master
hunt
preached
twice
every
sunday
while
the
men
sat
on
felled
trunks
reverently
listening
to
his
long
sermons
while
the
houses
were
being
built
smith
with
some
twenty
others
was
sent
to
explore
the
country
they
sailed
up
the
river
and
found
the
indians
to
all
appearance
friendly
but
they
found
no
gold
or
precious
stones
and
could
hear
nothing
of
a
passage
to
the
pacific
ocean
which
they
had
been
told
to
seek
so
they
returned
to
jamestown
arriving
here
they
found
that
the
day
before
the
indians
had
attacked
the
settlement
and
that
one
englishman
lay
slain
and
seventeen
injured
this
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
wingfield
who
had
trusted
in
the
friendliness
of
the
indians
but
at
length
he
was
persuaded
to
allow
fortifications
to
be
built
even
then
however
the
colonists
were
not
secure
for
as
they
went
about
their
business
felling
trees
or
digging
the
ground
the
savages
would
shoot
at
them
from
the
shelter
of
the
surrounding
forest
if
a
man
strayed
from
the
fort
he
was
sure
to
return
wounded
if
he
returned
at
all
and
in
this
sort
of
warfare
the
stolid
english
were
no
match
for
the
wily
indians
our
men
says
smith
by
their
disorderly
straggling
were
often
hurt
when
the
savages
by
the
nimbleness
of
their
heels
well
escaped
so
six
months
passed
and
the
ships
which
had
brought
out
the
colonists
were
ready
to
go
back
to
england
with
a
cargo
of
wood
instead
of
the
gold
which
the
company
had
hoped
for
but
before
the
ships
sailed
smith
who
was
still
considered
in
disgrace
and
therefore
kept
out
of
the
council
insisted
on
having
a
fair
trial
for
he
would
not
have
captain
newport
go
home
and
spread
evil
stories
about
him
smith
enemies
were
unwilling
to
allow
the
trial
but
smith
would
take
no
denial
so
at
length
his
request
was
granted
the
result
being
that
he
was
proved
innocent
of
every
charge
against
him
and
was
at
length
admitted
to
the
council
now
at
last
something
like
peace
was
restored
and
captain
newport
set
sail
for
home
he
promised
to
make
all
speed
he
could
and
to
be
back
in
five
months
time
and
indeed
he
had
need
to
hasten
for
the
journey
outward
had
been
so
long
the
supply
of
food
so
scant
that
already
it
was
giving
out
and
when
captain
newport
sailed
it
was
plain
that
the
colonists
had
not
food
enough
to
last
fifteen
weeks
such
food
it
was
too
it
consisted
chiefly
of
grain
a
pint
was
served
out
daily
for
each
man
and
this
boiled
and
made
into
a
sort
of
porridge
formed
their
chief
food
their
drink
was
cold
water
for
tea
and
coffee
were
unknown
in
those
days
and
beer
they
had
none
to
men
used
to
the
beer
and
beef
of
england
in
plenty
this
indeed
seemed
meagre
diet
had
we
been
as
free
of
all
sins
as
gluttony
and
drunkenness
says
smith
we
might
have
been
canonised
as
saints
our
wheat
having
fried
some
weeks
in
the
ship
hold
contained
as
many
worms
as
grains
so
that
we
might
truly
call
it
rather
so
much
bran
than
corn
our
drink
was
water
our
lodging
castles
in
the
air
there
was
fish
enough
in
the
river
game
enough
in
the
woods
but
the
birds
and
beasts
were
so
wild
and
the
men
so
unskilful
and
ignorant
in
ways
of
shooting
and
trapping
that
they
succeeded
in
catching
very
little
besides
which
there
were
few
among
the
colonists
who
had
any
idea
of
what
work
meant
more
than
half
the
company
were
gentlemen
adventurers
dare
devil
shiftless
men
who
had
joined
the
expedition
in
search
of
excitement
with
no
idea
of
labouring
with
their
hands
badly
fed
unused
to
the
heat
of
a
virginian
summer
the
men
soon
fell
their
tents
were
rotten
their
houses
yet
unbuilt
trees
remained
unfelled
the
land
untilled
while
the
men
lay
on
the
bare
ground
about
the
fort
groaning
and
in
misery
many
died
and
soon
those
who
remained
were
so
feeble
that
they
had
scarce
strength
to
bury
the
dead
or
even
to
crawl
to
the
common
kettle
for
their
daily
measure
of
porridge
in
their
misery
the
men
became
suspicious
and
jealous
and
once
more
quarrels
were
rife
wingfield
had
never
been
loved
now
many
grew
to
hate
him
for
they
believed
that
while
they
starved
he
kept
back
for
his
own
use
secret
stores
of
oil
and
wine
and
other
dainties
no
explanations
were
of
any
avail
and
he
was
deposed
from
his
office
of
president
and
another
chosen
in
his
place
as
autumn
drew
on
the
misery
began
to
lessen
for
the
indians
whose
corn
was
now
ripe
began
to
bring
it
to
the
fort
to
barter
it
for
chisels
and
beads
and
other
trifles
wild
fowl
too
such
as
ducks
and
geese
swarmed
in
the
river
so
with
good
food
and
cooler
weather
the
sick
soon
began
to
mend
energy
returned
to
them
and
once
more
they
found
strength
to
build
and
thatch
their
houses
and
led
by
smith
they
made
many
expeditions
among
the
indians
bringing
back
great
stores
of
venison
wild
turkeys
bread
and
grain
in
exchange
for
beads
hatchets
bells
and
other
but
all
the
misery
through
which
the
colonists
had
passed
had
taught
them
nothing
they
took
no
thought
for
the
time
to
come
when
food
might
again
be
scarce
they
took
no
care
of
it
but
feasted
daily
on
good
bread
fish
and
fowl
and
wild
beasts
as
fat
as
we
could
eat
them
says
smith
now
one
december
day
smith
set
out
on
an
exploring
expedition
up
the
chickahominy
river
it
was
a
hard
journey
for
the
river
was
so
overgrown
with
trees
that
the
men
had
to
hew
a
path
for
the
little
vessel
at
length
the
barque
could
go
no
further
so
smith
left
it
and
went
on
in
a
canoe
with
only
two
englishmen
and
two
indians
as
guides
for
a
time
all
went
well
but
one
day
he
and
his
companions
went
ashore
to
camp
while
the
others
were
preparing
a
meal
smith
taking
one
of
the
indians
with
him
went
on
to
explore
a
little
further
but
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
heard
the
wild
war
whoop
of
the
indians
guessing
at
once
that
they
had
come
against
him
he
resolved
to
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
might
be
so
seizing
the
indian
guide
he
tied
his
arm
fast
to
his
own
with
his
garters
then
with
pistol
in
his
right
hand
and
holding
the
indian
in
front
of
him
as
a
shield
he
pushed
as
rapidly
as
he
could
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
arrows
flew
round
him
thick
and
fast
but
smith
good
buff
coat
turned
them
aside
the
whole
forest
was
alive
with
indians
but
although
from
the
shelter
of
the
trees
they
showered
arrows
upon
smith
none
dared
approach
him
to
take
him
for
they
knew
and
dreaded
the
terrible
fire
stick
which
he
held
in
his
hand
smith
fired
again
and
yet
again
as
he
retreated
and
more
than
one
indian
fell
never
more
to
rise
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
bushes
and
trees
trying
to
catch
glimpses
of
the
dusky
figures
as
they
skulked
among
them
and
paid
little
heed
to
the
path
he
was
taking
so
suddenly
he
found
himself
floundering
in
a
quagmire
still
he
fought
for
dear
life
and
as
long
as
he
held
his
pistol
no
redman
dared
come
near
to
take
him
but
at
length
chilled
and
wet
and
half
cold
unable
to
go
further
he
saw
it
was
useless
to
resist
longer
so
he
tossed
away
his
pistol
at
once
the
savages
closed
in
upon
and
dragging
him
out
of
the
quagmire
led
him
to
their
chief
smith
had
given
in
because
he
knew
that
one
man
stuck
in
a
quagmire
could
not
hope
to
keep
three
hundred
indians
long
at
bay
but
he
had
sharp
wits
as
well
as
a
steady
hand
and
with
them
he
still
fought
for
his
life
as
soon
as
he
was
brought
before
the
chief
he
whipped
out
his
compass
and
showing
it
to
the
chief
explained
to
him
that
it
always
pointed
north
and
thus
the
white
men
were
able
to
find
their
way
through
the
pathless
desert
to
the
indians
this
seemed
like
magic
they
marvelled
greatly
at
the
shining
needle
which
they
could
see
so
plainly
and
yet
not
touch
seeing
their
interest
smith
went
on
to
explain
other
marvels
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
the
roundness
of
the
earth
until
those
who
heard
were
quite
sure
he
was
a
great
medicine
man
thus
smith
fought
for
his
life
but
at
length
utterly
exhausted
he
could
say
no
more
so
while
the
chief
still
held
the
little
ivory
compass
and
watched
the
quivering
needle
his
followers
led
smith
away
to
his
own
camp
fire
here
lay
the
other
white
men
dead
thrust
through
with
many
arrows
and
here
the
indians
warmed
and
chafed
his
benumbed
body
and
treated
him
with
all
the
kindness
they
knew
but
that
brought
smith
little
comfort
for
he
knew
it
was
the
indian
way
a
famous
warrior
might
be
sure
of
kindness
at
their
hands
if
they
meant
in
the
end
to
slay
him
with
awful
torture
and
so
thoroughly
warmed
and
restored
in
less
than
an
hour
smith
found
himself
fast
bound
to
a
tree
while
grim
warriors
terribly
painted
danced
around
him
bows
and
arrows
in
hand
they
were
about
to
slay
him
when
the
chief
holding
up
the
compass
bade
them
lay
down
their
weapons
such
a
medicine
man
he
had
decided
must
not
thus
be
slain
so
smith
was
unbound
for
some
weeks
smith
was
marched
hither
and
thither
from
village
to
village
he
was
kindly
enough
treated
but
he
never
knew
how
long
the
kindness
would
last
and
he
constantly
expected
death
yet
he
was
quite
calm
he
kept
a
journal
and
in
this
he
set
down
accounts
of
many
strange
sights
he
saw
not
knowing
if
indeed
they
would
ever
be
read
at
length
smith
was
brought
to
the
wigwam
of
the
great
the
chief
of
chiefs
or
emperor
as
these
simple
english
folk
called
him
to
receive
the
white
prisoner
the
powhatan
put
on
his
greatest
bravery
feathered
and
painted
and
wearing
a
wide
robe
of
raccoon
skins
he
sat
upon
a
broad
couch
beside
a
fire
on
either
side
of
him
sat
one
of
his
wives
and
behind
in
grim
array
stood
his
warriors
row
upon
row
behind
them
again
stood
the
squaws
their
faces
and
shoulders
were
painted
bright
red
about
their
necks
they
wore
chains
of
white
beads
and
on
their
heads
the
down
of
white
birds
it
was
a
weird
scene
and
the
flickering
firelight
added
to
its
strangeness
silent
and
still
as
statues
the
warriors
stood
then
as
john
smith
was
led
before
the
chief
they
raised
a
wild
shout
as
that
died
away
to
silence
one
of
the
powhatan
squaws
rose
and
brought
a
basin
of
water
to
smith
in
this
he
washed
his
hands
and
then
another
squaw
brought
him
a
bunch
of
feathers
instead
of
a
towel
with
which
to
dry
them
after
this
the
indians
feasted
their
prisoner
with
savage
splendour
then
a
long
consultation
took
place
what
was
said
smith
knew
not
he
only
knew
that
his
life
hung
in
the
balance
the
end
of
the
consultation
he
felt
sure
meant
life
or
death
for
him
at
length
the
long
talk
came
to
an
end
two
great
stones
were
placed
before
the
chief
then
as
many
as
could
lay
hands
on
smith
seized
him
and
dragging
him
to
the
stones
they
threw
him
on
the
ground
and
laid
his
head
upon
them
fiercely
then
they
brandished
their
clubs
and
smith
knew
that
his
last
hour
had
come
and
that
the
indians
were
about
to
beat
out
his
brains
but
the
raised
clubs
never
fell
for
with
a
cry
pocahontas
the
chief
young
daughter
sprang
through
the
circle
of
warriors
she
stood
beside
the
prisoner
pleading
for
his
life
but
the
indians
were
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
prayers
for
mercy
so
seeing
that
all
her
entreaties
were
in
vain
she
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
beside
smith
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
crying
out
that
if
they
would
beat
out
his
brains
they
should
beat
hers
out
too
of
all
his
many
children
the
powhatan
loved
this
little
daughter
best
he
could
deny
her
nothing
so
smith
life
was
saved
he
should
live
said
the
powhatan
to
make
hatchets
for
him
and
bells
and
beads
for
his
little
daughter
having
thus
been
saved
smith
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
tribe
two
days
later
he
was
admitted
as
such
with
fearsome
ceremony
having
painted
and
decorated
himself
as
frightfully
as
he
could
the
powhatan
caused
smith
to
be
taken
to
a
large
wigwam
in
the
forest
the
wigwam
was
divided
in
two
by
a
curtain
and
in
one
half
a
huge
fire
burned
smith
was
placed
upon
a
mat
in
front
of
the
fire
and
left
alone
he
did
not
understand
in
the
least
what
was
going
on
and
marvelled
greatly
what
this
new
ceremony
might
mean
but
he
had
not
sat
long
before
the
fire
when
he
heard
doleful
sounds
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
then
from
behind
it
appeared
the
powhatan
with
a
hundred
others
as
hideously
painted
as
himself
and
told
smith
that
now
that
they
were
brothers
he
might
go
back
to
his
fort
so
with
twelve
guides
smith
set
out
yet
in
spite
of
all
their
feasting
and
ceremonies
smith
scarcely
believed
in
the
friendship
of
the
indians
and
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
himself
when
he
at
length
reached
jamestown
in
safety
chief
name
was
wahunsunakok
the
name
of
the
tribe
powhatan
and
the
english
called
the
chief

powhatan
chapter
more
adventures
of
captain
john
smith
smith
had
been
away
from
the
settlement
nearly
a
month
and
he
returned
to
find
the
colony
in
confusion
and
misery
many
had
died
and
those
who
remained
were
quarrelling
among
themselves
indeed
some
were
on
the
point
of
deserting
and
sneaking
off
to
england
in
the
one
little
ship
they
had
they
were
not
in
the
least
pleased
to
see
smith
return
and
they
resolved
once
more
to
get
rid
of
him
so
they
accused
him
of
causing
the
death
of
the
two
men
who
had
gone
with
him
and
condemned
him
to
death
thus
smith
had
only
escaped
from
the
hands
of
the
indians
to
be
murdered
by
his
own
people
the
order
went
forth
he
was
to
be
hanged
next
day
but
suddenly
all
was
changed
for
a
man
looking
out
to
sea
saw
a
white
sail
ship
ahoy
he
shouted
ship
ahoy
at
the
joyful
sound
the
men
forgot
their
bickerings
and
hurrying
to
the
shore
welcomed
the
new
arrival
it
was
captain
newport
with
his
long
promised
help
he
soon
put
a
stop
to
the
hanging
business
and
also
set
poor
captain
wingfield
free
for
he
had
been
kept
prisoner
ever
since
he
had
been
deposed
newport
had
brought
food
for
the
colony
but
he
had
also
brought
many
new
settlers
unfortunately
too
one
day
the
storehouse
was
set
on
fire
and
much
of
the
grain
was
destroyed
so
that
in
spite
of
the
new
supplies
the
colony
would
soon
again
have
been
in
the
old
starving
condition
had
it
not
been
for
pocahontas
she
was
resolved
that
her
beloved
white
chief
should
want
for
nothing
and
now
every
four
or
five
days
she
came
to
the
fort
laden
with
provisions
smith
also
took
captain
newport
to
visit
the
powhatan
and
great
barter
was
made
of
blue
beads
and
tinsel
ornaments
for
grain
and
foodstuffs
after
a
time
captain
newport
sailed
home
again
taking
the
deposed
president
wingfield
with
him
he
took
home
also
great
tales
of
the
savage
emperor
might
and
splendour
and
king
james
was
so
impressed
with
what
he
heard
that
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
powhatan
should
be
crowned
so
in
autumn
captain
newport
returned
again
to
jamestown
bringing
with
him
more
settlers
among
them
two
women
he
also
brought
a
crown
and
other
presents
to
the
powhatan
from
king
james
together
with
a
command
for
his
coronation
so
smith
made
a
journey
to
the
powhatan
village
and
begged
him
to
come
to
jamestown
to
receive
his
presents
but
the
powhatan
refused
to
go
for
he
was
suspicious
and
stood
upon
his
dignity
if
your
king
has
sent
me
presents
he
said
i
also
am
a
king
and
this
is
my
land
eight
days
will
i
wait
here
to
receive
them
your
father
newport
must
come
to
me
not
i
to
him
so
with
this
answer
smith
went
back
and
seeing
nothing
else
for
it
captain
newport
set
out
for
the
powhatan
village
with
the
presents
he
did
not
in
the
least
want
to
go
but
the
king
had
commanded
that
the
powhatan
was
to
be
crowned
and
the
king
had
to
be
obeyed
he
arrived
safely
at
weronocomoco
and
the
next
day
was
appointed
for
the
coronation
first
the
presents
were
brought
out
and
set
in
order
there
was
a
great
bed
with
hangings
and
curtains
of
damask
a
basin
and
ewer
and
other
costly
novelties
such
as
never
before
had
been
seen
in
these
lands
after
the
gifts
had
been
presented
the
englishmen
tried
to
place
a
fine
red
cloak
on
the
powhatan
shoulders
but
he
would
not
have
it
he
resisted
all
their
attempts
until
at
last
one
of
the
other
chiefs
persuaded
him
that
it
would
not
hurt
him
so
at
last
he
submitted
next
the
crown
was
produced
the
powhatan
had
never
seen
a
crown
and
had
no
idea
of
its
use
nor
could
he
be
made
to
understand
that
he
must
kneel
to
have
it
put
on
a
foul
trouble
there
was
says
one
of
the
settlers
who
writes
about
it
no
persuasions
or
explanations
were
of
any
avail
the
englishmen
knelt
down
in
front
of
him
to
show
him
what
he
must
do
they
explained
they
persuaded
until
they
were
worn
out
it
was
all
in
vain
the
powhatan
remained
as
stolid
as
a
mule
kneel
he
would
not
so
at
length
seeing
nothing
else
for
it
three
of
them
took
the
crown
in
their
hands
and
the
others
pressed
with
all
their
weight
upon
the
powhatan
shoulders
so
that
they
forced
him
to
stoop
a
little
and
thus
amid
howls
of
laughter
the
crown
was
hastily
thrust
on
his
head
as
soon
as
it
was
done
the
soldiers
fired
a
volley
in
honour
of
the
occasion
at
the
sound
the
monarch
started
up
in
terror
casting
aside
the
men
who
held
him
but
when
he
saw
that
no
one
was
killed
and
that
those
around
him
were
laughing
he
soon
recovered
from
his
fright
and
thanking
them
gravely
for
their
presents
he
pompously
handed
his
old
shoes
and
his
raccoon
cloak
to
captain
newport
as
a
present
for
king
james
thus
this
strangest
of
all
coronations
came
to
an
end
this
senseless
ceremony
did
no
good
but
rather
harm
the
powhatan
had
resisted
being
crowned
with
all
his
might
but
afterwards
he
was
much
puffed
up
about
it
and
began
to
think
much
more
of
himself
and
much
less
of
the
white
people
among
others
smith
thought
it
was
nothing
but
a
piece
of
tomfoolery
and
likely
to
bring
trouble
ere
long
for
some
months
now
he
had
been
president
and
as
president
he
wrote
to
the
london
company
for
the
coronation
of
powhatan
he
said
by
whose
advice
you
sent
him
such
presents
i
know
not
but
this
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
i
fear
they
will
be
the
confusion
of
us
all
ere
we
hear
from
you
again
smith
told
the
company
other
plain
truths
they
had
been
sending
out
all
sorts
of
idle
fine
gentlemen
who
had
never
done
a
work
in
their
lives
they
could
not
fell
a
tree
and
when
they
tried
the
axe
blistered
their
tender
fingers
some
of
them
worked
indeed
cheerfully
enough
but
it
took
ten
of
them
to
do
as
much
work
as
one
good
workman
others
were
simply
stirrers
up
of
mischief
one
of
these
smith
now
sent
back
to
england
lest
the
company
should
cut
his
throat
and
smith
begged
the
company
to
keep
those
sort
of
people
at
home
in
the
future
and
send
him
carpenters
and
gardeners
blacksmiths
and
masons
and
people
who
could
do
something
captain
newport
now
sailed
home
and
smith
was
left
to
govern
the
colony
and
find
food
for
the
many
hungry
mouths
he
went
as
usual
to
trade
with
the
indians
but
he
found
them
no
longer
willing
to
barter
their
corn
for
a
little
copper
or
a
handful
of
beads
they
now
wanted
swords
and
guns
the
powhatan
too
grew
weary
of
seeing
the
squatting
on
the
land
of
which
he
was
crowned
king
he
forgot
his
vows
of
friendship
with
smith
all
he
wanted
was
to
see
the
palefaces
leave
his
country
and
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
them
was
to
starve
them
but
although
the
powhatan
had
grown
tired
of
seeing
the
stride
like
lords
through
his
land
he
yet
greatly
admired
them
and
now
he
wanted
more
than
anything
else
to
have
a
house
a
palace
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
windows
and
fireplaces
like
those
they
built
for
themselves
at
jamestown
for
in
the
little
native
houses
which
his
followers
could
build
there
was
no
room
for
the
splendid
furniture
which
had
been
sent
to
him
for
his
coronation
so
now
he
sent
to
smith
asking
him
to
send
white
men
to
build
a
house
smith
at
once
sent
some
men
to
begin
the
work
and
soon
followed
with
others
on
their
way
to
the
powhatan
town
smith
and
his
companions
stopped
a
night
with
another
friendly
chief
who
warned
them
to
beware
of
the
powhatan
you
will
find
him
use
you
well
he
said
but
trust
him
not
and
be
sure
he
hath
no
chance
to
seize
your
arms
for
he
hath
sent
for
you
only
to
cut
your
throats
however
in
spite
of
this
warning
smith
decided
to
go
on
so
he
thanked
the
friendly
chief
for
his
good
counsel
and
assuring
him
that
he
would
love
him
always
for
it
he
went
on
his
way
it
was
winter
time
now
and
the
rivers
were
half
frozen
over
the
land
was
covered
with
snow
and
icy
winds
blew
over
it
indeed
the
weather
was
so
bad
that
for
a
week
smith
and
his
men
could
not
go
on
but
had
to
take
refuge
with
some
friendly
indians
here
in
the
warm
wigwams
they
were
cosy
and
jolly
the
savages
treated
them
kindly
and
fed
them
well
on
oysters
fish
game
and
christmas
came
and
went
while
they
were
with
these
kindly
savages
and
at
length
the
weather
becoming
a
little
better
they
decided
to
push
on
after
many
adventures
they
reached
the
village
they
were
very
weary
from
their
long
cold
journey
and
taking
possession
of
the
first
houses
they
came
to
they
sent
a
message
to
the
powhatan
telling
him
that
they
had
come
and
asking
him
to
send
food
this
the
old
chief
immediately
did
and
soon
they
were
dining
royally
on
bread
venison
and
turkeys
the
next
day
too
the
powhatan
sent
them
supplies
of
food
then
he
calmly
asked
how
long
they
were
going
to
stay
and
when
they
would
be
gone
at
this
smith
was
greatly
astonished
for
had
not
the
powhatan
sent
for
him
i
did
not
send
for
you
said
the
wily
old
savage
and
if
you
have
come
for
corn
i
have
none
to
give
you
still
less
have
my
people
but
he
added
slyly
if
perchance
you
have
forty
swords
i
might
find
forty
baskets
of
corn
in
exchange
for
them
you
did
not
send
for
me
said
smith
in
astonishment
how
can
that
be
for
i
have
with
me
the
messengers
you
sent
to
ask
me
to
come
and
they
can
vouch
for
the
truth
of
it
i
marvel
that
you
can
be
so
forgetful
then
seeing
that
he
could
not
fool
the
the
old
chief
laughed
merrily
pretending
that
he
had
only
been
joking
but
still
he
held
to
it
that
he
would
give
no
corn
except
in
exchange
for
guns
and
swords
powhatan
answered
smith
believing
your
promises
to
satisfy
my
wants
and
out
of
love
to
you
i
sent
you
my
men
for
your
building
thereby
neglecting
mine
own
needs
now
by
these
strange
demands
you
think
to
undo
us
and
bring
us
to
want
indeed
for
you
know
well
as
i
have
told
you
long
ago
of
guns
and
swords
i
have
none
to
spare
yet
steal
from
you
or
wrong
you
i
will
not
nor
yet
break
that
friendship
which
we
have
promised
each
other
unless
by
bad
usage
you
force
me
thereto
when
the
powhatan
heard
smith
speak
thus
firmly
he
pretended
to
give
way
and
promised
that
within
two
days
the
english
should
have
all
the
corn
he
and
his
people
could
spare
but
he
added
my
people
fear
to
bring
you
corn
seeing
you
are
all
armed
for
they
say
you
come
not
hither
for
trade
but
to
invade
my
country
and
take
possession
of
it
therefore
to
free
us
of
this
fear
lay
aside
your
weapons
for
indeed
here
they
are
needless
we
being
all
friends
with
such
and
many
more
cunning
words
the
powhatan
sought
to
make
captain
smith
and
his
men
lay
aside
their
arms
but
to
all
his
persuasions
smith
turned
a
deaf
ear
nay
he
said
we
have
no
thought
of
revenge
or
cruelty
against
you
when
your
people
come
to
us
at
jamestown
we
receive
them
with
their
bows
and
arrows
with
you
it
must
be
the
same
we
wear
our
arms
even
as
our
clothes
so
seeing
that
he
could
not
gain
his
end
the
old
chief
gave
in
yet
one
more
effort
he
made
to
soften
the
englishman
heart
i
have
never
honoured
any
chief
as
i
have
you
he
said
with
a
sigh
yet
you
show
me
less
kindness
than
any
one
you
call
me
father
but
you
do
just
as
you
like
smith
however
would
waste
no
more
time
parleying
and
gave
orders
for
his
men
to
fetch
the
corn
but
while
he
was
busy
with
this
the
powhatan
slipped
away
and
gathered
his
warriors
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
their
business
smith
and
one
or
two
others
found
themselves
cut
off
from
their
comrades
and
surrounded
by
a
yelling
crowd
of
painted
savages
instantly
the
englishmen
drew
their
swords
and
charging
into
the
savages
put
them
to
flight
seeing
how
easily
their
warriors
had
been
routed
and
how
strong
the
were
the
savage
chiefs
tried
to
make
friends
with
them
again
pretending
that
the
attack
upon
them
was
a
mistake
and
that
no
evil
against
them
had
been
intended
the
englishmen
however
put
no
more
trust
in
their
words
and
sternly
with
loaded
guns
and
drawn
swords
in
hand
bade
them
to
talk
no
more
but
make
haste
and
load
their
boat
with
corn
and
so
thoroughly
cowed
were
the
savages
by
the
fierce
words
and
looks
of
the
that
they
needed
no
second
bidding
hastily
laying
down
their
bows
and
arrows
they
bent
their
backs
to
the
work
their
one
desire
now
being
to
get
rid
as
soon
as
possible
of
these
fierce
and
powerful
intruders
when
the
work
was
done
however
it
was
too
late
to
sail
that
night
for
the
tide
was
low
so
the
englishmen
returned
to
the
house
in
which
they
lodged
to
rest
till
morning
and
wait
for
high
water
meanwhile
the
powhatan
had
by
no
means
given
up
his
desire
for
revenge
and
while
the
englishmen
sat
by
their
fire
he
plotted
to
slay
them
all
but
as
he
talked
with
his
braves
pocahontas
listened
and
when
she
heard
that
the
great
chief
whom
she
loved
so
dearly
was
to
be
killed
her
heart
was
filled
with
grief
and
she
resolved
to
save
him
so
silently
she
slipped
out
into
the
dark
night
and
trembling
lest
she
should
be
discovered
was
soon
speeding
through
the
wild
lonesome
forest
towards
the
hut
reaching
it
in
safety
she
burst
in
upon
them
as
they
sat
in
the
firelight
waiting
for
the
powhatan
to
send
their
supper
you
must
not
wait
she
cried
you
must
go
at
once
my
father
is
gathering
all
his
force
against
you
he
will
indeed
send
you
a
great
feast
but
those
who
bring
it
have
orders
to
slay
you
and
any
who
escape
them
he
is
ready
with
his
braves
to
slay
oh
if
you
would
live
you
must
flee
at
once
and
as
she
spoke
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
the
englishmen
were
truly
grateful
to
pocahontas
for
her
warning
they
thanked
her
warmly
and
would
have
laden
her
with
gifts
of
beads
and
coloured
cloth
and
such
things
as
the
indians
delighted
in
but
she
would
not
take
them
i
dare
not
take
such
things
she
said
for
if
my
father
saw
me
with
them
he
would
know
that
i
had
come
here
to
warn
you
and
he
would
kill
me
so
with
eyes
blinded
with
tears
and
her
heart
filled
with
dread
she
slipped
out
of
the
hut
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
of
the
forest
as
suddenly
and
silently
as
she
had
come
left
alone
the
englishmen
cocking
their
guns
and
drawing
their
swords
awaited
the
coming
of
the
foe
presently
eight
or
ten
lusty
fellows
arrived
each
bearing
a
great
platter
of
food
steaming
hot
and
excellent
to
smell
they
were
very
anxious
that
the
englishmen
should
at
once
lay
aside
their
arms
and
sit
down
to
supper
but
captain
smith
would
take
no
chances
loaded
gun
in
hand
he
stood
over
the
messengers
and
made
them
taste
each
dish
to
be
certain
that
none
of
them
were
poisoned
having
done
this
he
sent
the
men
away
and
bid
your
master
make
haste
he
said
for
we
are
ready
for
him
then
the
englishmen
sat
down
to
supper
but
they
had
no
thought
of
sleep
and
all
night
long
they
kept
watch
powhatan
too
kept
watch
and
every
now
and
again
he
would
send
messengers
to
find
out
what
the
englishmen
were
about
but
each
time
they
came
the
savages
found
the
englishmen
on
guard
so
they
dared
not
attack
at
last
day
dawned
and
with
the
rising
tide
the
englishmen
sailed
away
still
to
all
seeming
on
friendly
terms
with
the
wily
indians
smith
had
now
food
enough
to
keep
the
colony
from
starvation
for
a
short
time
at
least
but
his
troubles
were
by
no
means
over
the
indians
were
still
often
unfriendly
and
the
colonists
themselves
lazy
and
unruly
some
indeed
worked
well
and
cheerfully
but
many
wandered
about
idly
doing
nothing
at
length
it
came
about
that
thirty
or
forty
men
did
all
the
work
the
others
being
simply
idle
loiterers
seeing
this
smith
called
all
the
colonists
together
one
day
and
told
them
that
he
would
suffer
the
idleness
no
longer
every
one
must
do
his
share
he
said
and
he
who
will
not
work
shall
not
eat
and
so
powerful
had
he
grown
that
he
was
obeyed
the
idle
were
forced
to
work
and
soon
houses
were
built
and
land
cleared
and
tilled
at
length
there
seemed
good
hope
that
the
colony
would
prosper
but
now
another
misfortune
befell
it
for
it
was
found
that
rats
had
got
into
the
granaries
and
eaten
nearly
all
the
store
of
corn
so
once
again
expeditions
set
forth
to
visit
the
indians
and
gather
more
from
them
but
their
supply
too
was
running
short
harvest
was
still
a
long
way
off
and
all
the
colonists
could
collect
was
not
enough
to
keep
them
from
starvation
so
seeing
this
smith
divided
his
men
into
companies
sending
some
down
the
river
to
fish
and
others
into
the
woods
to
gather
roots
and
wild
berries
but
the
lazy
ones
liked
this
little
they
would
have
bartered
away
their
tools
and
firearms
to
the
savages
for
a
few
handfuls
of
meal
rather
than
work
so
hard
they
indeed
became
so
mutinous
that
smith
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
them
but
at
length
he
discovered
the
ringleader
of
these
gluttonous
loiterers
him
he
worthily
punished
and
calling
the
others
together
he
told
them
very
plainly
that
any
man
among
them
who
did
not
do
his
share
should
be
banished
from
the
fort
as
a
drone
till
he
mended
his
ways
or
starved
to
the
idlers
smith
seemed
a
cruel
still
they
obeyed
him
so
the
colony
was
held
together
although
in
misery
and
hunger
and
without
hope
for
the
future
at
length
one
day
to
the
men
on
the
river
there
came
a
joyful
sight
they
saw
a
ship
slowly
sailing
towards
them
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
for
no
ship
was
expected
but
they
greeted
it
with
all
the
more
joy
it
was
a
ship
under
captain
samuel
argall
come
it
is
true
not
to
bring
supplies
but
to
trade
finding
however
that
there
was
no
hope
of
trade
captain
argall
shared
what
food
he
had
with
the
famished
colonists
and
so
for
a
time
rescued
them
from
starvation
he
also
brought
the
news
that
more
ships
were
setting
out
from
home
bringing
both
food
and
men
in
june
this
fleet
of
nine
ships
really
did
set
out
but
one
ship
was
wrecked
on
the
way
another
the
sea
venture
was
cast
ashore
on
the
bermudas
only
seven
arrived
at
length
at
jamestown
bringing
many
new
colonists
unfortunately
among
these
new
arrivals
there
were
few
likely
to
make
good
colonists
they
were
indeed
for
the
most
part
wild
bad
men
whose
friends
had
packed
them
off
to
that
distant
land
in
the
hope
of
being
rid
of
them
forever
they
were
said
one
of
the
old
colonists
who
wrote
of
them
ten
times
more
fit
to
spoil
a
commonwealth
than
either
to
begin
one
or
but
help
to
maintain
one
now
with
all
these
unruly
gallants
poured
into
his
little
commonwealth
smith
found
his
position
of
president
even
more
difficult
than
before
still
for
a
time
if
he
could
not
keep
them
altogether
in
order
he
at
least
kept
them
in
check
then
one
day
by
a
terrible
accident
his
rule
was
brought
to
a
sudden
end
he
was
returning
from
an
expedition
up
the
james
river
when
through
some
carelessness
a
bag
of
gunpowder
in
his
boat
was
exploded
smith
was
not
killed
by
it
but
he
was
sorely
hurt
in
great
pain
and
no
longer
able
to
think
and
act
for
others
he
was
carried
back
to
jamestown
here
there
was
no
doctor
of
any
kind
and
seeing
himself
then
only
a
useless
hulk
and
in
danger
of
death
smith
gave
up
his
post
and
leaving
the
colony
for
which
during
two
and
a
half
years
he
had
worked
and
thought
and
fought
so
hard
he
sailed
homeward
many
of
the
unruly
sort
were
glad
to
see
him
go
but
his
old
companions
with
whom
he
had
shared
so
many
dangers
and
privations
were
filled
with
grief
he
ever
hated
baseness
sloth
pride
and
indignity
said
one
of
them
he
never
allowed
more
for
himself
than
for
his
soldiers
with
him
upon
no
danger
would
he
send
them
where
he
would
not
lead
them
himself
he
would
never
see
us
want
what
he
either
had
or
could
by
any
means
get
us
he
loved
action
more
than
words
and
hated
falsehood
and
covetousness
worse
than
death
so
loved
and
hated
but
having
all
unknown
to
himself
made
a
name
which
would
live
forever
in
the
history
of
his
land
the
first
great
virginian
sailed
from
its
shores
he
returned
no
more
some
twenty
years
later
he
died
in
london
and
was
buried
in
the
church
of
sepulchre
there
upon
his
tomb
was
carved
a
long
epitaph
telling
of
his
valiant
deeds
but
in
the
great
fire
of
london
the
tomb
was
destroyed
and
now
no
tablet
marks
the
of
the
brave
old
pioneer
chapter
how
the
colony
was
saved
after
smith
left
the
colony
of
jamestown
fell
into
wild
disorder
every
one
wanted
to
go
his
own
way
a
new
president
named
percy
had
indeed
been
chosen
but
although
an
honest
gentleman
he
was
sickly
and
weak
and
quite
unfit
to
rule
these
turbulent
spirits
so
twenty
or
more
presidents
soon
sprang
up
and
in
the
whole
colony
there
was
neither
obedience
nor
discipline
no
work
was
done
food
was
recklessly
wasted
and
very
quickly
famine
stared
the
wretched
colonists
in
the
face
the
terrible
time
afterwards
known
as
the
starving
time
had
begun
when
their
stores
were
gone
the
settlers
tried
to
get
more
in
the
old
way
from
the
natives
but
they
seeing
the
miserable
plight
of
the
became
insolent
in
their
demands
and
in
return
for
niggardly
supplies
of
food
exacted
guns
and
ammunition
swords
and
tools
and
now
there
was
no
man
among
the
colonists
who
knew
how
to
manage
the
indians
as
smith
had
managed
them
there
was
no
man
among
them
who
thought
of
the
future
all
they
wanted
was
to
stay
for
a
time
the
awful
pangs
of
hunger
so
they
bartered
away
their
muskets
and
powder
their
tools
and
everything
of
value
of
which
they
were
possessed
but
even
so
the
food
the
indians
gave
them
in
return
was
not
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
the
colony
became
a
place
of
horror
where
pale
creatures
roamed
about
eyeing
each
other
suspiciously
ready
to
kill
each
other
for
a
crust
or
a
bone
they
quarreled
among
themselves
and
they
quarreled
with
the
natives
and
the
natives
now
no
longer
filled
with
awe
lay
in
wait
for
them
and
killed
them
almost
without
resistance
if
they
ventured
to
crawl
beyond
the
walls
of
the
fort
many
more
died
of
hunger
and
of
disease
brought
on
by
hunger
so
less
than
eight
months
after
smith
had
sailed
away
of
the
five
hundred
men
he
had
left
behind
him
but
sixty
remained
alive
the
colony
was
being
wiped
out
and
the
little
town
itself
was
disappearing
for
the
starving
wretches
had
no
strength
or
energy
to
fell
trees
and
hew
wood
and
as
soon
as
a
man
died
his
house
was
pulled
down
by
his
comrades
and
used
as
firewood
already
too
weeds
and
briers
overgrew
the
land
which
had
been
cleared
for
corn
greater
misery
and
desolation
it
is
hard
to
imagine
yet
the
unhappy
beings
sank
into
a
still
deeper
horror
unable
to
relieve
the
pangs
of
hunger
they
turned
cannibal
and
fed
upon
each
other
thus
the
last
depths
of
degradation
were
sounded
the
last
horrors
of
the
starving
time
were
reached
then
at
length
one
may
day
two
ships
came
sailing
up
the
james
river
and
anchored
in
the
harbour
from
their
decks
bronzed
men
in
patched
and
ragged
garments
looked
with
astonished
eyes
upon
the
desolate
scene
these
were
the
men
of
the
wrecked
sea
venture
who
had
been
cast
ashore
upon
the
bermudas
their
ship
had
gone
down
but
they
had
been
able
to
save
both
themselves
and
nearly
everything
out
of
her
some
of
the
best
men
of
the
expedition
had
sailed
in
the
sea
venture
their
leaders
were
brave
and
energetic
so
instead
of
bemoaning
their
fate
they
had
set
to
work
with
right
good
will
and
after
ten
months
labour
had
succeeded
in
building
two
little
ships
which
they
named
the
patience
and
the
deliverance
then
having
filled
them
with
such
stores
as
they
could
muster
they
set
sail
joyfully
to
join
their
comrades
at
jamestown
but
now
what
horror
and
astonishment
was
theirs
they
had
hoped
to
find
a
flourishing
town
surrounded
by
well
tilled
fields
instead
they
saw
ruins
and
desolation
they
had
hoped
to
be
greeted
joyfully
by
stalwart
prosperous
englishmen
instead
a
few
gaunt
spectres
who
scarce
seemed
men
crawled
to
meet
them
lost
in
amazement
the
newcomers
landed
and
as
they
listened
to
the
tragic
tale
pity
filled
their
hearts
they
gave
the
starving
wretches
food
and
comforted
them
as
best
they
could
they
had
no
great
stores
themselves
and
they
saw
at
once
that
with
such
scant
supplies
as
they
had
it
would
be
impossible
to
settle
at
jamestown
even
if
they
could
get
through
the
summer
the
autumn
would
bring
no
relief
for
the
fields
where
the
corn
for
the
winter
use
should
already
have
been
sprouting
lay
neglected
and
overgrown
with
weeds
and
briers
the
houses
where
the
newcomers
might
have
lodged
had
disappeared
the
very
palisading
which
surrounded
the
settlement
as
a
bulwark
against
the
indians
had
been
pulled
down
for
firewood
all
the
tools
and
implements
which
might
have
been
used
to
rebuild
the
place
had
been
bartered
away
to
the
indians
the
indians
themselves
were
no
longer
friendly
but
hostile
whichever
way
they
looked
only
misery
and
failure
stared
them
in
the
face
the
captains
of
the
patience
and
deliverance
talked
long
together
but
even
they
could
see
no
ray
of
hope
so
with
heavy
hearts
they
resolved
once
more
to
abandon
virginia
they
were
loath
indeed
to
come
to
this
decision
loath
indeed
to
own
themselves
defeated
but
there
seemed
no
other
course
left
open
to
them
so
one
day
early
in
june
the
pitiful
remnant
of
the
jamestown
colony
went
on
board
the
two
waiting
ships
sir
thomas
gates
the
brave
and
wise
captain
of
the
expedition
was
the
last
to
leave
the
ruined
town
with
backward
looks
he
left
it
and
ere
he
weighed
anchor
he
fired
a
last
salute
to
the
lost
colony
then
the
sails
were
set
and
the
two
little
ships
drifted
down
stream
towards
the
open
sea
carrying
the
beaten
settlers
back
to
old
england
another
attempt
to
plant
a
new
england
beyond
the
seas
had
failed
but
next
day
as
the
little
ships
dropped
down
stream
the
sailors
on
the
lookout
saw
a
boat
being
rowed
towards
them
was
it
an
indian
canoe
did
it
come
in
peace
or
war
it
drew
nearer
then
it
was
seen
that
it
was
no
indian
canoe
but
an
english
tug
boat
manned
by
english
sailors
with
a
shout
they
hailed
each
other
and
news
was
exchanged
wonderful
news
it
was
to
which
the
brokenhearted
colonists
listened
lord
delaware
the
new
governor
of
virginia
had
arrived
his
three
good
ships
well
stored
with
food
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
colony
were
but
a
little
way
down
stream
there
was
no
need
for
the
settlers
to
flee
home
to
escape
starvation
and
death
it
may
be
that
to
some
this
news
was
heavy
news
it
may
be
that
some
would
gladly
have
turned
their
backs
forever
upon
the
spot
where
they
had
endured
so
much
misery
but
for
the
most
part
the
colonists
were
unwilling
to
own
defeat
and
they
resolved
at
once
to
return
so
the
ships
were
put
about
and
three
days
after
they
had
left
jamestown
as
they
believed
forever
the
colonists
once
more
landed
there
as
lord
delaware
stepped
on
shore
he
fell
upon
his
knees
giving
thanks
to
god
that
he
had
come
in
time
to
save
virginia
after
that
the
chaplain
preached
a
sermon
then
the
new
governor
with
all
his
company
about
him
read
aloud
the
commission
given
to
him
by
king
james
this
was
the
first
royal
commission
ever
given
to
a
governor
of
an
english
colony
in
america
in
it
lord
delaware
was
given
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
all
and
every
person
and
persons
now
inhabiting
or
which
shall
hereafter
inhabit
within
the
precincts
of
the
said
colony
the
colonists
were
in
fact
to
be
his
subjects
and
having
read
aloud
his
commission
and
having
thus
as
it
were
shown
his
authority
lord
delaware
next
spoke
sternly
to
his
new
subjects
he
warned
them
that
he
would
no
longer
endure
their
sluggish
idleness
or
haughty
disobedience
and
if
they
did
not
amend
their
ways
they
might
look
to
it
that
the
most
severe
punishment
of
the
law
would
come
upon
them
having
thus
spoken
his
mind
plainly
to
cheer
them
he
told
of
the
plentiful
and
good
stores
he
had
brought
with
him
of
which
all
those
who
worked
well
and
faithfully
should
have
a
share
now
a
new
life
began
for
the
colony
all
the
settlers
were
made
to
work
for
some
hours
every
day
even
the
gentlemen
among
them
whose
breeding
never
knew
what
a
day
labour
meant
had
to
do
their
share
soon
the
houses
were
rebuilt
the
palisades
stood
again
in
place
two
forts
were
erected
to
guard
against
attacks
by
the
indians
and
at
length
the
colony
seemed
to
be
on
the
fair
way
to
success
of
course
this
did
not
all
happen
at
once
the
idlers
were
not
easily
turned
into
diligent
workers
or
unruly
brawlers
into
peaceful
citizens
indeed
it
was
only
through
most
stern
and
what
would
seem
to
us
now
most
cruel
punishments
that
the
unruly
were
forced
to
keep
the
law
the
winter
after
lord
delaware
came
out
as
governor
although
not
so
hard
as
that
of
the
starving
time
was
yet
severe
and
many
of
the
colonists
died
lord
delaware
too
became
so
ill
that
in
the
spring
he
sailed
home
to
england
and
after
a
little
time
sir
thomas
dale
took
his
place
as
deputy
governor
sir
thomas
dale
was
both
a
soldier
and
a
statesman
he
was
full
of
energy
and
courage
and
dogged
he
was
merciless
to
the
evildoers
yet
kindly
to
those
who
tried
to
do
well
under
his
stern
yet
righteous
rule
the
colony
prospered
at
first
only
men
settlers
had
come
out
then
one
or
two
women
joined
them
and
now
many
more
women
came
so
that
the
men
instead
of
all
living
together
married
and
had
homes
of
their
own
then
too
at
first
all
a
man
labour
went
into
the
common
stock
and
the
men
who
worked
little
fared
as
well
as
those
who
worked
a
great
deal
so
the
lazy
fellow
did
as
little
as
he
could
glad
when
he
could
slip
from
his
labour
says
an
old
writer
or
slumber
over
his
task
he
cared
not
how
thus
most
of
the
work
of
the
colony
was
left
to
the
few
who
were
industrious
and
willing
sir
thomas
dale
changed
that
in
return
for
a
small
yearly
payment
in
corn
he
gave
three
acres
of
land
to
every
man
who
wished
it
for
his
own
use
so
suddenly
a
little
community
of
farmers
sprang
up
now
that
the
land
was
really
their
own
to
make
of
it
what
they
would
each
man
tilled
it
eagerly
and
soon
such
fine
crops
of
grain
were
raised
that
the
colony
was
no
longer
in
dread
of
starvation
the
settlers
too
began
to
spread
and
no
longer
kept
within
the
palisade
round
jamestown
more
especially
as
jamestown
says
an
old
writer
was
scandalised
for
an
unhealthy
aire
and
here
and
there
further
up
the
river
little
villages
sprang
up
since
smith
had
gone
home
the
indians
had
remained
unfriendly
and
a
constant
danger
to
the
colonists
and
now
as
they
became
thus
scattered
the
danger
from
the
indians
became
ever
greater
old
powhatan
and
his
men
were
constantly
making
raids
upon
the
with
whom
he
had
once
been
so
friendly
and
in
spite
of
the
watch
they
kept
he
often
succeeded
in
killing
them
or
taking
them
prisoner
he
had
also
by
now
quite
a
store
of
swords
guns
and
tools
stolen
from
the
english
and
how
to
subdue
him
or
force
him
to
live
on
friendly
terms
with
them
once
more
none
knew
pocahontas
who
had
been
so
friendly
and
who
had
more
than
once
saved
the
from
disaster
might
have
helped
them
but
she
now
never
came
near
their
settlement
indeed
she
seemed
to
have
disappeared
altogether
so
the
english
could
get
no
aid
from
her
but
now
it
happened
one
day
that
one
of
the
adventurers
samuel
argall
who
was
it
is
written
a
good
marriner
and
a
very
civil
gentleman
went
sailing
up
the
appomattox
in
search
of
corn
for
the
settlement
he
had
to
go
warily
because
no
one
could
tell
how
the
indians
would
behave
for
they
would
be
friends
or
foes
just
as
it
suited
them
if
they
got
the
chance
of
killing
the
and
stealing
their
goods
they
would
do
so
but
if
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
do
that
they
would
willingly
trade
for
the
coloured
cloths
beads
and
hatchets
they
so
much
wanted
presently
argall
came
to
the
country
of
one
of
the
chiefs
with
whom
he
had
made
friends
while
here
he
was
told
that
pocahontas
the
great
powhatan
daughter
was
living
with
the
tribe
as
soon
as
he
heard
this
captain
argall
saw
at
once
that
here
was
a
means
of
forcing
the
powhatan
to
make
peace
and
he
resolved
at
all
costs
to
get
possession
of
pocahontas
so
sending
for
the
chief
he
told
him
he
must
bring
pocahontas
on
board
his
ship
but
the
chief
was
afraid
and
refused
to
do
this
then
we
are
no
longer
brothers
and
friends
said
argall
my
father
said
the
chief
be
not
wroth
for
if
i
do
this
thing
the
powhatan
will
make
war
upon
me
and
upon
my
people
my
brother
said
argall
have
no
fear
if
so
be
that
the
powhatan
shall
make
war
upon
you
i
will
join
with
you
against
him
to
overthrow
him
utterly
i
mean
moreover
no
manner
of
hurt
to
pocahontas
but
will
only
keep
her
as
hostage
until
peace
be
made
between
the
powhatan
and
the
if
therefore
you
do
my
bidding
i
will
give
to
you
the
copper
kettle
which
you
desire
so
much
now
the
chief
longed
greatly
to
possess
the
copper
kettle
so
he
promised
to
do
as
argall
asked
and
began
to
cast
about
for
an
excuse
for
getting
pocahontas
on
board
soon
he
fell
upon
a
plan
he
bade
his
wife
pretend
that
she
was
very
anxious
to
see
the
ship
but
when
she
asked
to
be
taken
on
board
he
refused
to
go
with
her
again
and
again
she
asked
again
and
again
the
chief
refused
then
the
poor
lady
wept
with
disappointment
and
at
length
the
chief
pretending
to
be
very
angry
swore
that
he
would
beat
her
if
she
did
not
cease
her
asking
and
her
tears
but
as
she
still
begged
and
wept
he
said
he
would
take
her
if
pocahontas
would
go
too
to
please
the
old
woman
pocahontas
went
captain
argall
received
all
three
very
courteously
and
made
a
great
feast
for
them
in
his
cabin
the
old
chief
however
was
so
eager
to
get
his
promised
kettle
that
he
could
little
enjoy
the
feast
but
kept
kicking
captain
argall
under
the
table
as
much
as
to
say
i
have
done
my
part
now
you
do
yours
at
length
captain
argall
told
pocahontas
that
she
must
stay
with
him
until
peace
was
made
between
her
father
and
the
white
men
as
soon
as
the
old
chief
and
his
wife
heard
that
they
began
to
howl
and
cry
and
make
a
great
noise
so
as
to
pretend
that
they
knew
nothing
about
the
plot
pocahontas
too
began
to
cry
but
argall
assured
her
that
no
harm
was
intended
her
and
that
she
need
have
no
fear
so
she
was
soon
comforted
and
dried
her
eyes
as
for
the
wily
old
indians
they
were
made
quite
happy
with
the
copper
kettle
and
a
few
other
trifles
and
went
merrily
back
to
the
shore
a
messenger
was
then
sent
to
the
powhatan
telling
him
that
his
daughter
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
was
a
prisoner
and
that
he
could
only
ransom
her
by
sending
back
all
the
he
held
prisoner
with
all
their
guns
swords
and
tools
which
he
had
stolen
when
powhatan
got
this
news
he
was
both
angry
and
sorry
for
he
loved
his
daughter
very
dearly
but
he
loved
the
englishmen
tools
and
weapons
almost
more
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
so
for
three
months
he
did
nothing
then
at
last
he
sent
back
seven
of
his
prisoners
each
one
carrying
a
useless
gun
tell
your
chieftain
he
said
that
all
the
rest
of
the
arms
of
the
are
lost
or
have
been
stolen
from
me
but
if
the
will
give
back
my
daughter
i
will
give
satisfaction
for
all
the
other
things
i
have
taken
together
with
five
hundred
bushels
of
corn
and
will
make
peace
forever
but
the
englishmen
were
not
easily
deceived
they
returned
a
message
to
the
chief
saying
your
daughter
is
well
used
but
we
do
not
believe
the
rest
of
our
arms
are
either
lost
or
stolen
and
therefore
until
you
send
them
we
will
keep
your
daughter
the
powhatan
was
so
angry
when
he
got
this
message
that
for
a
long
time
he
would
have
no
further
dealings
with
the
but
continued
to
vex
and
harass
them
as
much
as
he
could
at
length
sir
thomas
dale
seeking
to
put
an
end
to
this
took
pocahontas
and
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
sailed
up
the
river
to
the
powhatan
chief
town
as
soon
as
the
savages
saw
the
white
men
they
came
down
to
the
bank
jeering
at
them
and
insulting
them
haughtily
demanding
why
they
had
come
we
have
brought
the
powhatan
daughter
replied
the
englishmen
for
we
are
come
to
receive
the
ransom
promised
and
if
you
do
not
give
it
willingly
we
will
take
it
by
force
but
the
savages
were
not
in
the
least
afraid
at
that
threat
they
jeered
the
more
if
so
be
they
cried
that
you
are
come
to
fight
you
are
right
welcome
for
we
are
ready
for
you
but
we
advise
you
if
you
love
your
lives
to
retire
with
haste
else
we
will
serve
you
as
we
have
served
others
of
your
countrymen
oh
answered
the
englishmen
we
must
have
a
better
answer
than
that
and
driving
their
ship
nearer
to
the
shore
they
made
ready
to
land
but
as
soon
as
they
were
within
bow
shot
the
savages
let
fly
their
arrows
thick
and
fast
they
fell
rattling
on
the
deck
glancing
from
the
men
armour
wounding
not
a
few
this
reception
made
the
englishmen
angry
so
without
more
ado
they
launched
their
boats
and
made
for
the
shore
the
savages
fled
at
their
coming
and
so
enraged
were
the
colonists
against
them
that
they
burned
their
houses
and
utterly
destroyed
their
town
then
they
sailed
on
up
the
river
in
pursuit
of
the
redmen
next
day
they
came
up
again
with
the
savages
they
were
now
not
so
insolent
and
sent
a
messenger
to
ask
why
the
had
burned
their
town
why
did
you
fire
upon
us
asked
the
englishmen
sternly
brothers
replied
the
redmen
we
did
not
fire
upon
you
it
was
but
some
stray
savages
who
did
so
we
intend
you
no
hurt
and
are
your
friends
with
these
and
many
other
fair
words
they
tried
to
pacify
the
so
the
englishmen
who
had
no
wish
to
fight
made
peace
with
them
then
the
indians
sent
a
messenger
to
the
powhatan
who
was
a
day
journey
off
and
the
englishmen
were
told
they
must
wait
two
days
for
his
answer
meanwhile
the
englishmen
asked
to
see
their
comrades
whom
the
indians
had
taken
prisoner
we
can
not
show
them
to
you
replied
the
wily
redmen
for
they
have
all
run
away
in
fear
lest
you
should
hang
them
but
the
men
are
pursuing
after
them
and
will
doubtless
bring
them
back
then
where
are
the
swords
and
guns
which
you
have
stolen
from
us
demanded
the
englishmen
these
you
shall
have
replied
the
redmen
but
as
the
englishmen
well
knew
this
was
all
idle
talk
and
deceit
and
next
day
no
message
came
from
the
powhatan
neither
were
any
swords
nor
guns
forthcoming
so
once
more
the
englishmen
set
sail
and
went
still
further
up
the
river
here
quite
close
to
another
village
belonging
to
the
powhatan
they
came
upon
four
hundred
indians
in
war
paint
when
they
saw
the
englishmen
the
indians
yelled
and
danced
and
dared
them
to
come
ashore
this
the
englishmen
nothing
daunted
accordingly
did
the
redmen
on
their
side
showed
no
fear
but
walked
boldly
up
and
down
among
the
englishmen
demanding
to
speak
with
their
captain
so
the
chiefs
were
brought
to
sir
thomas
why
do
you
come
against
us
thus
they
asked
we
are
friends
and
brothers
let
us
not
fight
until
we
have
sent
once
again
to
our
king
to
know
his
pleasure
then
if
he
sends
not
back
the
message
of
peace
we
will
fight
you
and
defend
our
own
as
best
we
may
the
englishmen
knew
well
that
by
all
this
talk
of
peace
the
indians
wanted
but
to
gain
time
so
that
they
might
be
able
to
carry
away
and
hide
their
stores
still
they
had
no
desire
to
fight
if
by
any
other
means
they
might
gain
their
end
so
they
promised
a
truce
until
noon
the
day
following
and
if
we
then
decide
to
fight
you
you
shall
be
warned
of
it
by
the
sounding
of
our
drums
and
trumpets
they
said
the
truce
being
settled
pocahontas
two
brothers
came
on
board
the
englishmen
ships
to
visit
their
sister
and
when
they
saw
that
she
was
well
cared
for
and
appeared
to
be
quite
happy
they
were
very
glad
for
they
had
heard
that
she
was
ill
treated
and
most
miserable
but
finding
her
happy
they
promised
to
persuade
their
father
to
ransom
her
and
make
friends
again
with
the
seeing
them
thus
friendly
sir
thomas
suggested
that
pocahontas
two
brothers
should
stay
on
board
his
vessel
as
hostages
while
he
sent
two
of
his
company
to
parley
with
the
powhatan
this
was
accordingly
done
and
master
john
rolfe
and
master
sparkes
set
off
on
their
mission
when
however
they
reached
the
village
where
the
powhatan
was
hiding
they
found
him
still
in
high
dudgeon
and
he
refused
to
see
them
or
speak
with
them
so
they
had
to
be
content
with
seeing
his
brother
who
treated
them
with
all
courtesy
and
kindness
and
promised
to
do
his
best
to
pacify
the
powhatan
it
was
now
april
and
high
time
for
the
colonists
to
be
back
on
their
farms
sowing
their
corn
so
with
this
promise
they
were
fain
to
be
content
in
the
meantime
and
having
agreed
upon
a
truce
until
harvest
time
they
set
sail
once
more
for
jamestown
taking
pocahontas
with
them
one
at
least
among
the
company
of
englishmen
was
glad
that
the
negotiations
with
the
powhatan
had
come
to
nothing
and
that
pocahontas
had
not
been
ransomed
that
was
master
john
rolfe
for
pocahontas
although
a
savage
was
beautiful
and
kind
and
john
rolfe
had
fallen
madly
in
love
with
her
so
he
had
no
desire
that
she
should
return
to
her
own
tribe
but
rather
that
she
should
return
to
jamestown
and
marry
him
pocahontas
too
was
quite
fond
of
john
rolfe
although
she
had
never
forgotten
her
love
for
the
great
white
chief
whose
life
she
had
saved
the
englishmen
however
told
her
that
he
had
gone
away
never
to
come
back
any
more
and
that
very
likely
he
was
dead
pocahontas
was
then
easily
persuaded
to
marry
john
rolfe
but
he
himself
although
he
loved
her
very
much
had
some
misgivings
for
was
this
beautiful
savage
not
a
heathen
that
difficulty
was
however
soon
overcome
for
pocahontas
made
no
objection
to
becoming
a
christian
so
one
day
there
was
a
great
gathering
in
the
little
church
at
jamestown
when
the
heathen
princess
stood
beside
the
fort
and
the
water
of
christian
baptism
was
sprinkled
on
her
dark
face
and
she
was
given
the
bible
name
of
rebecca
and
now
when
the
powhatan
heard
that
his
daughter
was
going
to
marry
one
of
the
he
was
quite
pleased
he
forgot
all
his
anger
and
sulkiness
sent
many
of
his
braves
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
and
swore
to
be
the
friend
and
brother
of
the
forever
more
sir
thomas
dale
was
delighted
so
every
one
was
pleased
and
one
morning
early
in
april
three
hundred
years
ago
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
round
both
redman
and
white
gathered
to
see
the
wedding
and
from
that
day
for
eight
years
as
long
as
the
powhatan
lived
there
was
peace
between
him
and
his
brothers
the
chapter
how
pocahontas
took
a
journey
over
the
seas
at
peace
with
the
indians
the
colonists
could
till
their
fields
without
fear
of
attack
and
now
besides
corn
they
began
to
grow
tobacco
you
remember
that
columbus
had
noticed
how
the
natives
of
his
india
smoked
dried
leaves
but
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
it
then
the
men
of
raleigh
expedition
again
noticed
it
they
tried
it
themselves
found
it
comforting
and
brought
both
tobacco
and
the
habit
home
with
them
and
soon
not
only
the
seafaring
adventurers
but
many
a
man
who
was
never
likely
to
see
the
ocean
or
adventure
beyond
his
native
town
had
taken
to
smoking
that
too
despite
his
king
disgust
at
it
for
james
thought
smoking
was
a
custom
loathsome
to
the
eye
hateful
to
the
nose
harmful
to
the
brain
dangerous
to
the
lungs
and
in
the
black
smoking
fumes
thereof
nearest
resembling
the
horrible
stygian
smoke
of
the
pit
that
is
bottomless
he
indeed
wrote
a
little
book
against
it
which
he
called
a
counterblaste
to
tobacco
but
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
him
the
demand
for
tobacco
became
greater
and
greater
and
soon
the
virginian
farmers
found
that
there
was
a
sale
for
as
much
tobacco
as
they
could
grow
and
that
a
crop
of
it
paid
better
than
anything
else
up
till
now
the
colony
had
been
a
constant
disappointment
to
the
adventurers
that
is
to
the
people
who
had
given
the
money
to
fit
out
the
expeditions
the
shareholders
we
would
now
call
them
most
of
them
had
adventured
their
money
not
with
any
idea
of
founding
a
new
england
beyond
the
seas
where
men
should
settle
down
as
farmers
and
tillers
of
the
soil
they
had
adventured
it
rather
for
the
finding
of
gold
and
pearls
jewels
and
spices
so
that
it
might
be
repaid
quickly
and
a
hundredfold
but
year
by
year
passed
and
all
these
glittering
hopes
were
doomed
to
disappointment
no
gold
was
found
the
adventurers
saw
their
money
being
swallowed
up
for
nought
they
grew
discontented
and
grumbled
some
of
them
refused
to
pay
any
more
refused
to
throw
more
away
on
an
empty
dream
they
little
knew
that
they
were
helping
to
found
a
new
state
which
in
time
was
to
become
one
of
the
world
greatest
powers
they
little
knew
that
in
days
to
come
their
money
should
produce
a
harvest
a
thousand
thousandfold
and
that
from
the
broad
land
of
which
they
had
helped
to
settle
a
tiny
corner
was
to
come
wealth
such
as
in
their
wildest
imaginings
they
had
never
dreamt
meanwhile
anything
a
virginian
wanted
he
could
buy
with
tobacco
indeed
after
a
time
the
virginians
threw
themselves
with
such
complete
enthusiasm
into
the
growing
of
tobacco
that
they
were
reproached
for
neglecting
everything
else
because
of
it
the
english
were
not
the
only
people
who
had
set
forth
to
find
golden
wealth
and
broad
lands
beyond
the
seas
both
the
french
and
the
dutch
had
carried
their
standard
across
the
ocean
and
planted
it
upon
the
further
shores
already
too
the
struggle
for
possession
began
captain
argall
in
one
of
his
many
expeditions
sailing
northward
to
the
bay
of
fundy
found
a
french
colony
settled
there
argall
swooped
down
upon
them
and
claiming
the
whole
continent
by
right
of
cabot
discovery
he
utterly
destroyed
the
colony
burning
the
houses
to
the
ground
and
carrying
off
the
cattle
argall
next
found
a
dutch
colony
on
the
hudson
river
here
he
contented
himself
with
ordering
the
governor
to
pull
down
the
dutch
flag
and
run
up
the
english
one
to
save
his
colony
the
dutchman
did
as
he
was
commanded
but
as
soon
as
the
arrogant
englishman
was
out
of
sight
he
calmly
ran
up
his
own
flag
once
more
meanwhile
under
sir
thomas
dale
virginia
continued
to
prosper
then
after
five
years
rule
sir
thomas
went
home
and
the
colony
was
left
to
a
new
ruler
with
him
went
john
rolfe
and
his
wife
pocahontas
together
with
their
little
baby
son
now
began
a
wonderful
new
life
for
the
beautiful
indian
only
a
few
years
before
she
had
been
a
merry
little
half
naked
savage
turning
cart
wheels
all
over
the
jamestown
fort
and
larking
with
the
boys
now
she
found
herself
treated
as
a
great
lady
in
those
days
the
people
in
england
had
very
little
idea
of
the
life
out
in
the
wilds
the
powhatan
they
had
heard
was
a
king
a
sort
of
emperor
indeed
and
they
doubtless
pictured
him
as
living
in
a
stately
palace
wearing
a
golden
crown
and
velvet
robes
that
a
king
should
be
a
savage
living
in
a
mud
hut
wearing
a
crown
of
feathers
on
his
head
and
a
string
of
beads
about
his
neck
they
could
not
imagine
as
the
powhatan
was
a
king
then
his
daughter
was
a
princess
and
as
such
must
be
treated
with
all
respect
it
is
even
said
that
john
rolfe
was
roundly
scolded
by
king
james
for
daring
to
marry
a
princess
without
first
asking
leave
for
he
gravely
pointed
out
if
the
powhatan
was
a
king
and
pocahontas
his
daughter
when
the
powhatan
died
rolfe
or
his
baby
son
might
become
king
of
virginia
it
was
not
meet
or
right
that
a
commoner
should
thus
lightly
take
upon
himself
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
brother
sovereign
every
one
then
was
ready
to
treat
pocahontas
with
deference
besides
this
john
smith
wrote
to
the
queen
relating
all
that
she
had
done
for
the
colony
of
virginia
and
begging
her
to
be
kind
to
the
indian
girl
who
had
done
so
much
for
england
for
that
or
some
other
reason
the
queen
took
an
interest
in
the
little
dusky
princess
pocahontas
was
presented
to
her
and
was
often
seen
at
the
theatre
or
other
entertainment
with
her
the
ladies
of
the
court
were
made
to
treat
pocahontas
with
great
ceremony
they
addressed
her
as
princess
or
lady
remained
standing
before
her
and
walked
backwards
when
they
left
her
presence
famous
artists
painted
her
portrait
poets
wrote
of
her
and
in
one
of
his
plays
ben
johnson
calls
her
the
blessed
pokahontas
as
the
historian
calls
her
and
great
daughter
of
virginia
in
fact
she
became
the
rage
she
was
the
talk
of
the
town
even
and
taverns
were
named
after
her
belle
sauvage
the
beautiful
savage
and
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
a
great
publishing
house
in
london
takes
its
name
from
one
of
these
old
taverns
books
go
out
to
all
the
world
from
the
sign
of
la
belle
sauvage
thus
forming
a
link
between
the
present
and
that
american
princess
of
so
long
ago
in
spite
of
all
the
homage
and
flattery
poured
upon
her
pocahontas
yet
remained
modest
and
simple
enchanting
all
who
met
her
and
among
all
the
new
delights
of
england
she
had
the
joy
of
seeing
once
again
the
great
white
chief
she
had
loved
and
called
her
father
in
days
gone
by
her
joy
was
all
the
greater
because
she
had
believed
him
to
be
dead
when
smith
first
came
to
see
her
her
feelings
were
so
deep
that
at
first
she
could
not
speak
she
greeted
him
in
silence
then
suddenly
turning
away
she
hid
her
face
and
wept
but
after
a
little
she
recovered
herself
and
began
to
speak
of
the
old
days
and
of
how
she
had
thought
he
was
dead
i
knew
no
other
she
said
until
i
came
to
plymouth
in
many
ways
pocahontas
showed
her
joy
at
again
recovering
her
old
friend
but
when
she
found
that
smith
was
not
going
to
treat
her
as
an
old
friend
but
as
if
she
were
a
great
lady
and
call
her
princess
like
all
the
others
round
her
she
was
hurt
you
did
promise
the
powhatan
that
what
was
yours
should
be
his
and
he
did
promise
the
like
to
you
she
said
a
stranger
in
his
land
you
called
him
father
and
i
shall
do
the
same
by
you
lady
replied
smith
i
dare
not
allow
that
title
for
you
are
a
king
daughter
but
from
the
man
who
had
known
her
in
those
strange
wild
days
in
virginia
from
the
man
she
had
looked
upon
as
a
great
and
powerful
chief
pocahontas
would
have
no
such
nonsense
she
laughed
at
him
you
were
not
afraid
she
said
defiantly
to
come
into
my
country
and
cause
fear
in
him
and
in
all
his
people
save
me
and
fear
you
here
that
i
should
call
you
father
i
tell
you
then
i
will
and
you
shall
call
me
child
and
so
i
will
be
forever
and
ever
your
countryman
pocahontas
took
all
the
strangeness
of
her
new
surroundings
very
simply
but
some
of
her
attendants
were
utterly
overwhelmed
with
wonder
and
awe
at
the
things
they
saw
one
man
in
particular
who
was
accounted
a
very
clever
man
among
his
own
people
had
been
sent
by
the
powhatan
to
take
particular
note
of
everything
in
england
among
other
things
he
had
been
charged
to
count
the
people
so
on
landing
at
plymouth
he
provided
himself
with
a
long
stick
and
proceeded
to
make
a
notch
in
it
for
every
man
he
met
but
he
met
so
many
people
that
he
could
not
make
notches
fast
enough
so
in
a
very
short
time
he
grew
weary
of
that
and
threw
his
stick
away
coming
to
london
he
was
more
amazed
than
ever
never
had
he
seen
so
great
a
city
nor
so
many
folk
all
gathered
together
and
among
them
not
one
familiar
face
so
he
welcomed
captain
john
smith
like
an
old
friend
and
eagerly
questioned
him
as
to
the
wonders
of
this
strange
country
more
especially
he
asked
to
see
god
the
king
and
queen
and
the
prince
captain
smith
tried
as
best
he
could
to
explain
to
the
poor
heathen
about
god
telling
him
he
could
not
be
seen
as
to
the
king
he
added
you
have
seen
him
no
said
the
indian
i
have
not
seen
your
great
king
then
when
captain
smith
explained
that
the
little
man
with
a
jeweled
feather
in
his
cap
and
sword
by
his
side
who
had
one
day
spoken
to
him
was
the
king
the
indian
was
much
disappointed
you
gave
powhatan
a
white
dog
he
said
which
powhatan
fed
as
himself
but
your
king
gave
me
nothing
however
if
the
old
indian
was
disappointed
with
the
manner
in
which
the
king
had
received
him
he
was
much
made
of
by
others
for
every
one
was
eager
to
see
this
wild
savage
and
often
to
please
these
new
friends
he
would
sing
to
them
and
make
their
blood
creep
by
his
wild
dances
pocahontas
loved
england
where
she
was
so
kindly
treated
she
took
to
the
new
life
so
well
that
it
is
said
she
soon
became
very
formal
and
civil
after
our
english
manner
but
she
who
had
been
used
to
roam
the
wild
woods
could
not
live
in
the
confinement
of
towns
and
soon
she
became
very
ill
so
she
made
up
her
mind
at
length
sorely
against
her
will
to
go
back
to
virginia
with
her
husband
captain
argall
was
about
to
return
there
as
deputy
governor
so
pocahontas
and
her
husband
took
passages
in
his
boat
but
pocahontas
was
never
again
to
see
her
native
shore
she
went
on
board
captain
argall
boat
the
george
and
indeed
set
sail
from
london
but
before
she
reached
gravesend
she
became
so
ill
that
she
had
to
be
taken
ashore
and
there
she
died
she
was
buried
in
the
chancel
of
the
parish
church
later
the
church
was
burned
down
but
it
was
rebuilt
and
as
a
memorial
to
pocahontas
american
ladies
have
placed
a
stained
glass
window
there
and
also
a
pulpit
made
of
virginian
wood
john
rolfe
returned
alone
to
virginia
leaving
his
little
son
thomas
behind
him
in
the
care
of
an
uncle
he
remained
in
england
until
he
was
grown
up
and
then
went
to
his
native
land
there
he
married
and
had
a
daughter
and
became
the
ancestor
of
several
virginian
families
who
are
to
this
day
proud
to
trace
their
descent
from
beautiful
pocahontas
and
her
english
husband
chapter
how
the
redmen
fought
against
their
white
brothers
the
colony
of
virginia
which
had
prospered
so
greatly
under
sir
thomas
dale
had
fallen
again
on
evil
days
for
samuel
argall
who
now
governed
proved
a
tyrant
dale
had
been
autocratic
but
he
had
been
autocratic
for
the
good
of
the
colony
argall
was
autocratic
for
his
own
gains
he
extorted
money
and
tribute
from
the
colonists
to
make
himself
rich
and
profits
which
should
have
gone
to
the
company
went
into
his
pocket
again
and
again
the
colonists
sent
home
complaints
of
argall
doings
at
length
these
complaints
became
so
loud
and
long
that
the
company
once
more
sent
lord
delaware
out
as
governor
but
on
the
way
lord
delaware
died
and
the
party
of
settlers
he
was
bringing
out
arrived
without
him
on
their
arrival
argall
at
once
took
possession
of
lord
delaware
private
papers
and
much
to
his
disgust
he
found
among
them
one
telling
lord
delaware
to
arrest
argall
and
send
him
back
to
england
this
made
argall
very
angry
it
also
made
him
more
despotic
and
cruel
than
ever
in
consequence
still
more
bitter
complaints
reached
home
from
the
colonists
at
this
time
the
company
at
home
were
quarrelling
among
themselves
but
in
the
end
they
sent
out
a
new
governor
called
sir
george
yeardley
he
too
had
orders
to
arrest
argall
and
send
him
home
but
argall
somehow
came
to
know
of
it
and
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
go
home
a
prisoner
so
before
the
new
governor
could
arrive
he
packed
up
his
goods
and
leaving
the
colony
to
take
care
of
itself
sailed
gaily
off
to
england
the
virginians
now
were
heartily
tired
of
despots
and
thought
that
it
was
time
that
they
had
some
say
in
the
matter
of
governing
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
company
at
home
there
was
at
this
time
a
wise
man
named
sandys
he
also
thought
that
it
would
be
best
for
the
colony
to
be
and
so
on
july
the
first
general
election
was
held
in
virginia
and
the
first
parliament
of
englishmen
in
america
met
there
were
by
this
time
about
two
thousand
people
living
in
the
colony
and
the
settlements
were
scattered
about
on
both
sides
of
the
river
for
sixty
miles
or
so
above
jamestown
so
the
colony
was
divided
into
eleven
parts
or
constituencies
each
constituency
sending
two
members
to
the
little
parliament
these
members
were
called
burgesses
and
the
parliament
was
called
the
house
of
burgesses
but
there
was
no
special
building
in
which
the
burgesses
could
gather
so
the
meetings
were
held
in
the
little
wooden
church
at
jamestown
and
thus
with
such
small
beginnings
were
the
first
foundations
of
a
free
and
independent
nation
laid
and
because
of
the
founding
of
this
house
of
burgesses
stands
out
as
the
year
most
to
be
remembered
in
all
the
early
days
of
virginia
but
has
to
be
remembered
for
another
and
this
time
a
sad
reason
for
it
saw
not
only
the
beginnings
of
freedom
but
the
beginnings
of
slavery
just
a
month
after
the
opening
of
the
house
of
burgesses
a
dutch
vessel
anchored
at
jamestown
the
captain
had
been
on
a
raiding
expedition
off
the
coast
of
africa
and
he
had
on
board
a
cargo
of
negroes
whom
he
had
stolen
from
their
homes
twenty
of
these
he
sold
to
the
farmers
and
thus
slavery
was
first
introduced
upon
the
virginian
plantations
in
too
there
arrived
the
first
of
women
colonists
nearly
all
the
settlers
were
men
a
few
indeed
had
brought
their
wives
and
daughters
with
them
but
for
the
most
part
the
colony
was
a
community
of
men
among
these
there
were
many
who
were
young
and
as
they
grew
rich
and
prosperous
they
wanted
to
marry
and
have
homes
of
their
own
but
there
was
no
one
for
them
to
marry
so
at
length
some
one
at
home
fell
upon
the
plan
of
persuading
young
women
to
go
out
to
virginia
to
settle
there
and
in
a
of
ninety
came
out
as
soon
as
they
arrived
they
found
many
young
men
eager
to
marry
them
and
sometimes
they
must
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
a
choice
but
as
soon
as
a
young
man
was
accepted
he
had
to
pay
the
company
afterwards
raised
to
of
tobacco
as
the
price
of
his
bride
passage
across
the
seas
then
they
were
free
to
marry
as
soon
as
they
pleased
after
this
from
time
to
time
women
went
out
to
the
colony
sometimes
we
read
of
a
widow
and
eleven
maids
or
again
of
fifty
maids
for
wives
and
always
there
came
with
them
a
letter
from
the
company
at
home
to
the
old
men
of
the
colony
reminding
them
that
these
young
women
did
not
come
to
be
servants
we
pray
you
therefore
to
be
fathers
to
them
in
their
business
not
enforcing
them
to
marry
against
their
wills
neither
send
them
to
be
servants
they
wrote
and
if
the
girls
did
not
marry
at
once
they
were
to
be
treated
as
guests
and
put
to
several
householders
that
have
wives
till
they
can
be
provided
of
husbands
helped
in
this
quaint
fashion
and
in
others
the
colony
prospered
and
grew
ever
larger
it
would
have
prospered
even
more
had
it
not
been
for
the
outbreak
of
a
kind
of
plague
which
the
colonists
simply
called
the
sickness
it
attacked
chiefly
the
new
settlers
and
was
so
deadly
that
in
one
year
a
thousand
of
them
died
doctors
were
not
very
skilful
in
those
days
and
although
they
did
their
best
all
their
efforts
were
of
little
use
till
at
length
the
dread
disease
wore
itself
out
but
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
the
colony
grew
the
settlements
extended
farther
and
farther
in
a
long
line
up
and
down
both
banks
of
the
james
from
chesapeake
bay
to
what
is
now
richmond
had
the
indians
been
unfriendly
the
colony
could
not
have
stretched
out
in
this
fashion
without
great
danger
to
the
settlers
but
for
eight
years
the
redmen
had
been
at
peace
with
their
white
brothers
and
the
settlers
had
lost
all
fear
of
attack
from
them
the
indians
indeed
might
be
seen
wandering
freely
about
the
towns
and
farms
they
came
into
the
houses
and
even
shared
the
meals
of
the
farmer
and
his
household
nothing
to
all
outward
seeming
could
be
more
friendly
than
the
relations
between
the
redmen
and
the
settlers
then
after
eight
years
old
powhatan
the
father
of
pocahontas
died
and
his
brother
became
chief
of
the
tribe
it
may
be
that
this
new
chief
was
known
not
to
be
so
friendly
to
the
as
his
brother
had
been
in
any
case
the
governor
took
the
precaution
of
sending
a
messenger
to
him
with
renewed
expressions
of
friendship
opekankano
received
the
messenger
kindly
and
sent
him
back
to
his
master
tell
the
he
said
that
i
hold
the
peace
so
sure
that
the
skies
shall
fall
sooner
than
it
should
be
broken
but
at
this
very
time
he
and
his
people
were
plotting
utterly
to
destroy
the
settlers
yet
they
gave
no
hint
of
it
they
had
planned
a
general
massacre
yet
two
days
before
the
of
march
the
day
fixed
for
it
some
settlers
were
safely
guided
through
the
woods
by
the
indians
they
came
as
usual
quite
unarmed
into
the
houses
selling
game
fish
and
furs
in
exchange
for
glass
beads
and
such
trifles
even
on
the
night
of
the
of
march
they
borrowed
the
settlers
boats
so
that
many
of
their
tribe
could
get
quickly
across
the
river
next
morning
in
many
places
the
indians
were
sitting
at
breakfast
with
the
settlers
and
their
families
when
suddenly
as
at
a
given
signal
they
sprang
up
and
seizing
the
settlers
own
weapons
killed
them
all
sparing
neither
men
women
nor
children
so
sudden
was
the
onslaught
that
many
a
man
fell
dead
without
a
cry
seeing
not
the
hand
which
smote
him
in
the
workshops
in
the
fields
in
the
gardens
wherever
they
were
wherever
their
daily
work
took
them
they
were
thus
suddenly
and
awfully
struck
down
for
days
and
weeks
the
indians
had
watched
the
habits
of
the
settlers
until
they
knew
the
daily
haunts
of
every
man
then
they
had
planned
one
swift
and
deadly
blow
which
was
to
wipe
out
the
whole
colony
and
so
cunning
was
their
plot
so
complete
and
perfect
their
treachery
that
they
might
have
succeeded
but
for
the
love
of
one
faithful
indian
this
indian
named
chanco
lived
with
one
of
the
settlers
named
pace
and
had
become
his
servant
but
pace
treated
him
more
as
a
son
than
as
a
servant
and
the
indian
had
become
very
devoted
to
him
when
then
this
indian
was
told
that
his
chief
commanded
him
to
murder
his
master
he
felt
that
he
could
not
do
it
instead
he
went
at
once
to
pace
and
told
him
of
the
plot
pace
then
made
ready
to
defend
himself
and
sent
warnings
to
all
the
other
settlers
within
reach
thus
a
great
many
of
the
colonists
were
saved
from
death
but
three
hundred
and
fifty
were
cruelly
slain
this
sudden
and
treacherous
attack
after
so
many
years
of
peace
enraged
the
white
men
and
they
followed
the
redmen
with
a
terrible
vengeance
they
hunted
them
like
wild
beasts
tracking
them
down
with
bloodhounds
driving
them
mercilessly
from
place
to
place
until
their
corn
destroyed
their
houses
burned
their
canoes
smashed
to

chapter
how
englishmen
fought
a
duel
with
tyranny
at
last
virginia
prospered
but
while
it
prospered
the
man
who
had
first
conceived
the
idea
of
this
new
england
beyond
the
seas
had
fallen
on
evil
days
sir
walter
raleigh
had
been
thrown
into
prison
by
king
james
there
for
twelve
long
years
he
languished
only
to
be
set
free
at
length
on
condition
that
he
should
find
a
for
his
king
he
failed
to
find
the
mine
and
by
his
efforts
only
succeeded
in
rousing
to
greater
heights
than
before
the
spanish
hatred
against
him
for
spain
claimed
the
land
and
gold
of
which
raleigh
had
gone
in
search
and
now
the
king
of
spain
demanded
that
he
should
be
punished
and
james
weakly
yielding
to
his
outcry
condemned
sir
walter
to
death
so
on
of
october
this
great
pioneer
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
meeting
death
as
gallantly
as
ever
man
died
i
shall
yet
live
to
see
it
virginia
an
english
nation
he
had
said
after
his
own
fifth
failure
to
found
a
colony
and
his
words
had
come
true
but
long
ere
his
death
raleigh
had
ceased
to
have
any
connection
with
virginia
and
perhaps
there
was
scarce
a
man
among
those
who
had
made
their
homes
there
who
remembered
that
it
was
raleigh
who
had
prepared
the
way
that
but
for
raleigh
a
new
spain
and
not
a
new
england
might
have
been
planted
on
the
american
shores
so
the
death
of
raleigh
made
no
difference
to
the
fortunes
of
virginia
but
the
same
stupidity
that
same
wonderful
instinct
for
the
wrong
side
of
every
question
which
made
james
kill
his
great
subject
also
made
him
try
to
stifle
the
infant
colony
so
while
in
spite
of
sickness
and
massacre
the
colony
prospered
the
company
at
home
was
passing
through
strenuous
times
the
head
or
treasurer
of
the
company
was
still
that
sir
edwin
sandys
who
had
been
the
chief
mover
in
giving
the
colony
king
james
who
was
full
of
great
ideas
about
the
divine
right
of
kings
had
never
forgiven
him
that
he
was
as
eager
as
any
of
his
people
to
build
up
a
colonial
empire
but
he
desired
that
it
should
be
one
which
should
be
dependent
on
himself
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
colonies
to
set
themselves
up
against
him
now
the
time
came
to
elect
a
new
treasurer
and
the
company
being
very
pleased
with
sandys
decided
to
elect
him
again
but
when
king
james
heard
that
he
was
very
angry
he
called
the
company
a
school
of
treason
and
sandys
his
greatest
enemy
then
flinging
himself
out
of
the
room
in
a
terrible
passion
he
shouted
choose
the
devil
if
you
will
but
not
sir
edwin
sandys
still
in
spite
of
the
king
anger
the
company
decided
to
go
its
own
way
they
had
their
charter
sealed
with
the
king
seal
signed
with
the
king
name
which
gave
them
the
right
of
freely
electing
their
own
officers
and
not
even
the
king
should
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
that
right
on
the
day
of
the
election
nearly
five
hundred
of
the
adventurers
gathered
together
three
names
were
put
up
for
election
sir
edwin
heading
the
list
but
just
as
the
voting
was
about
to
begin
a
messenger
from
the
king
arrived
it
is
not
the
king
pleasure
that
sir
edward
sandys
should
be
chosen
he
said
so
he
has
sent
to
you
a
list
of
four
one
of
which
you
may
choose
at
this
dead
silence
fell
upon
the
company
every
man
lost
in
amazement
at
this
breach
of
their
charter
for
minutes
the
heavy
silence
lasted
then
there
arose
murmurs
which
grew
ever
louder
until
amid
cries
of
anger
it
was
proposed
to
turn
the
king
messengers
out
no
said
the
earl
of
southampton
let
the
noble
gentlemen
keep
their
places
let
them
stay
and
see
that
we
do
everything
in
a
manner
which
is
fair
and
above
board
for
this
business
is
of
so
great
concernment
that
it
can
never
be
too
solemnly
too
thoroughly
or
too
publicly
examined
others
agreed
that
this
was
right
so
the
messengers
stayed
then
there
came
impatient
cries
from
every
part
of
the
hall
the
charter
the
charter
god
save
the
king
so
the
charter
was
brought
and
solemnly
read
then
the
secretary
stood
up
i
pray
you
gentlemen
he
said
to
observe
well
the
words
of
the
charter
on
the
point
of
electing
a
governor
you
see
it
is
thereby
left
to
your
own
free
choice
this
i
take
it
is
so
very
plain
that
we
shall
not
need
to
say
anything
more
about
it
and
no
doubt
these
gentlemen
when
they
depart
will
give
his
majesty
a
just
information
of
the
case
this
speech
was
received
with
great
noise
and
cheering
in
the
midst
of
it
a
friend
of
sir
edwin
stood
up
and
begged
for
silence
and
when
the
noise
had
abated
a
little
he
said
sir
edwin
asks
me
to
say
that
he
withdraws
his
name
for
election
i
therefore
propose
that
the
king
messengers
choose
two
names
and
that
we
choose
a
third
then
let
all
these
three
names
be
set
upon
the
balloting
box
and
so
go
to
the
election
in
god
name
and
let
his
will
be
done
thereupon
with
one
voice
the
whole
assembly
cried
out
southampton
southampton
the
king
messengers
then
pretended
that
they
were
quite
pleased
the
king
they
said
had
no
desire
to
infringe
their
rights
he
desired
no
more
than
that
sir
edwin
sandys
should
not
be
chosen
then
they
named
two
from
the
king
list
and
the
ballot
was
immediately
taken
the
result
being
that
one
of
the
king
men
had
two
votes
the
other
but
one
and
the
earl
of
southampton
all
the
rest
when
the
king
heard
of
this
result
he
was
a
little
anxious
and
apologetic
the
messengers
he
said
had
mistaken
his
intention
he
had
only
meant
to
recommend
his
friends
and
not
to
forbid
the
company
to
elect
any
other
but
once
again
englishmen
had
fought
a
duel
with
tyranny
and
won
from
this
day
however
the
king
hatred
of
the
company
became
deadly
he
harassed
it
in
every
way
and
at
last
in
took
its
charter
away
and
made
virginia
a
crown
colony
henceforth
in
theory
at
least
was
taken
away
from
virginia
and
to
the
king
alone
belonged
the
right
of
appointing
the
governor
and
council
but
in
fact
the
change
made
little
difference
to
the
colony
for
in
the
spring
of
king
james
died
and
his
son
charles
i
who
succeeded
him
upon
the
throne
had
so
much
else
to
trouble
him
that
he
paid
little
heed
to
virginia
chapter
the
coming
of
the
cavaliers
with
a
new
king
on
the
throne
life
in
virginia
went
on
much
as
it
had
done
governors
came
and
went
were
good
or
bad
strong
or
weak
there
were
troubles
with
the
indians
and
troubles
at
home
about
the
sale
of
tobacco
still
the
colony
lived
and
prospered
the
early
days
of
struggle
were
over
virginia
now
was
no
longer
looked
upon
as
a
place
of
exile
where
with
luck
one
could
make
a
fortune
and
return
home
to
england
to
enjoy
it
men
now
began
to
find
virginia
a
pleasant
place
and
look
upon
it
as
their
home
the
great
woods
were
full
of
game
the
streams
were
full
of
fish
so
that
the
englishman
could
shoot
and
angle
to
his
heart
content
the
land
was
so
fertile
that
he
did
not
need
to
work
half
so
hard
to
earn
a
living
as
he
had
to
do
at
home
while
the
climate
was
far
kindlier
so
the
colony
prospered
and
it
was
to
this
prosperous
colony
that
in
sir
william
berkeley
was
appointed
governor
he
was
a
courtly
imperious
gentleman
a
thorough
cavalier
who
dressed
in
satin
and
lace
and
ruled
like
a
tyrant
he
did
not
believe
in
freedom
of
thought
and
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
persecuting
the
puritans
who
had
found
refuge
in
virginia
for
just
about
the
time
of
berkeley
appointment
a
fierce
religious
war
between
cavalier
and
puritan
was
beginning
in
england
and
already
some
puritans
had
fled
to
virginia
to
escape
persecution
at
home
but
berkeley
soon
showed
them
that
they
had
come
to
the
wrong
place
and
bade
them
depart
the
colony
with
all
convenience
berkeley
did
not
believe
in
freedom
of
thought
and
he
disapproved
just
as
much
of
education
for
that
had
encouraged
freedom
of
thought
i
thank
god
he
said
some
years
later
there
are
no
free
schools
in
virginia
or
printing
and
i
hope
we
shall
not
have
them
these
hundred
years
for
learning
has
brought
disobedience
and
heresy
and
sects
into
the
world
and
printing
has
divulged
them
and
libels
against
the
best
government
god
keep
us
from
both
in
england
the
quarrel
between
king
and
people
grew
ever
fiercer
and
more
bitter
virginia
so
far
away
heard
the
echo
of
it
and
there
as
in
england
men
took
sides
the
men
in
virginia
were
ready
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
king
and
speak
their
mind
when
he
threatened
their
liberties
but
when
they
heard
that
the
people
in
england
had
taken
the
king
prisoner
and
were
talking
of
beheading
him
they
were
horrified
to
lay
bands
upon
his
person
to
lead
him
to
the
block
to
take
his
life
that
seemed
to
them
very
terrible
and
when
at
length
the
news
of
the
king
death
reached
virginia
the
virginians
forgot
their
grievances
they
became
king
men
and
berkeley
a
fervent
royalist
wrote
to
his
brother
royalists
at
home
asking
them
to
come
out
to
virginia
there
to
find
new
homes
far
from
the
rule
of
the
hated
usurper
cromwell
many
came
fleeing
from
their
native
land
in
horror
and
despairs
at
the
bloody
and
bitter
stroke
before
the
year
was
out
at
least
a
thousand
cavaliers
had
found
a
home
in
virginia
they
were
kindly
even
affectionately
received
every
house
was
open
to
them
every
hand
stretched
out
to
help
in
october
the
house
of
burgesses
met
and
at
once
declared
that
the
beheading
of
the
late
most
excellent
and
now
undoubtedly
sainted
king
was
treason
and
if
any
one
in
virginia
dared
to
defend
the
late
traitorous
proceedings
against
the
aforesaid
king
of
most
happy
memory
they
too
would
be
found
guilty
of
treason
and
worthy
of
death
worthy
of
death
too
should
be
any
one
who
seemed
by
word
or
deed
to
doubt
the
right
of
his
majesty
that
now
is
to
the
colony
of
virginia
thus
charles
ii
a
homeless
wanderer
was
acknowledged
king
of
virginia
in
this
manner
did
little
virginia
fling
down
the
gauntlet
to
great
britain
it
was
a
daring
deed
and
one
not
likely
to
go
unheeded
by
the
watchful
cromwell
yet
two
years
and
more
passed
then
british
ships
appeared
off
jamestown
at
once
the
virginians
made
ready
to
resist
cannon
were
mounted
the
gay
cavaliers
turned
out
in
force
sword
by
side
gun
in
hand
then
a
little
boat
flying
a
white
flag
was
seen
to
put
off
for
the
shore
it
was
a
messenger
from
the
british
captain
it
would
be
much
better
for
them
he
said
to
yield
peacefully
than
to
fight
and
be
beaten
for
hold
out
against
the
great
strength
of
britain
they
could
not
his
words
had
weight
with
the
virginians
yet
long
and
seriously
they
debated
some
would
have
held
out
but
others
saw
only
misery
and
destruction
in
such
a
course
so
at
length
they
surrendered
to
the
might
of
cromwell
the
conditions
were
not
severe
they
had
to
submit
and
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
british
parliament
those
who
refused
were
given
a
year
time
in
which
to
leave
the
colony
and
as
for
their
love
of
the
king
why
they
might
pray
for
him
and
drink
his
health
in
private
and
no
man
would
hinder
them
only
in
public
such
things
would
not
be
tolerated
in
bitterness
of
heart
the
cavalier
governor
gave
up
his
post
sold
his
house
in
jamestown
and
went
away
to
live
in
his
great
country
house
at
green
spring
here
amid
his
and
orchards
he
lived
in
a
sort
of
rural
state
riding
forth
in
his
great
coach
and
welcoming
with
open
arms
the
cavaliers
who
came
to
him
for
aid
and
comfort
in
those
evil
times
these
cavaliers
were
men
and
women
of
good
family
they
came
from
the
great
houses
of
england
and
in
their
new
homes
they
continued
to
lead
much
the
same
life
as
they
had
done
at
home
so
in
virginia
there
grew
up
a
cavalier
society
a
society
of
men
and
women
accustomed
to
command
accustomed
to
be
waited
upon
who
drove
about
in
gilded
coaches
and
dressed
in
silks
and
velvets
thus
the
plain
virginian
farmer
became
a
country
squire
from
these
cavalier
families
were
descended
george
washington
james
madison
and
other
great
men
who
helped
to
make
america
the
years
of
the
commonwealth
passed
quietly
in
virginia
having
made
the
colonists
submit
the
parliament
left
them
to
themselves
and
virginia
for
the
first
time
was
absolutely
but
the
great
protector
died
the
restoration
followed
when
the
careless
king
charles
ii
was
set
upon
the
throne
in
virginia
too
there
was
a
little
restoration
when
the
news
was
brought
the
cavaliers
flung
up
their
caps
and
shouted
for
joy
bonfires
were
lit
bells
were
rung
and
guns
fired
and
to
the
sound
of
drum
and
trumpet
charles
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
england
scotland
france
ireland
and
virginia
was
proclaimed
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
a
new
seal
was
made
upon
which
were
the
words
en
dat
virginia
quintum
meaning
behold
virginia
gives
the
fifth
dominion
henceforth
virginia
was
often
called
by
the
name
of
the
old
dominion
nor
was
that
all
for
with
the
restoration
of
the
stuarts
berkeley
too
was
restored
the
haughty
cavalier
left
his
country
manor
house
and
came
back
to
rule
at
jamestown
once
more
as
governor
and
captain
general
of
virginia
during
the
commonwealth
there
had
been
little
change
made
in
the
government
of
virginia
except
that
the
right
of
voting
for
the
burgesses
had
been
given
to
a
much
larger
number
of
people
that
did
not
please
sir
william
berkeley
at
all
he
took
away
the
right
from
a
good
many
people
when
he
came
back
to
power
too
he
found
the
house
of
burgesses
much
to
his
liking
so
instead
of
having
it
every
year
he
kept
the
same
members
for
fourteen
years
lest
the
people
should
elect
others
who
would
not
do
his
bidding
this
made
the
people
discontented
but
they
soon
had
greater
causes
for
discontent
first
there
was
the
navigation
law
this
law
had
been
passed
ten
years
before
but
had
never
really
been
put
in
force
in
america
by
this
law
it
was
ordered
that
no
goods
should
be
exported
from
the
colonies
in
america
except
in
british
ships
further
it
was
ordered
that
the
colonies
should
not
trade
with
any
country
save
england
and
ireland
or
some
other
of
his
said
plantations
it
was
a
foolish
law
meant
to
hurt
the
dutch
and
put
gold
into
the
pockets
of
british
merchants
instead
it
drove
the
colonies
to
rebellion
virginia
had
yet
another
grievance
virginia
which
for
eight
years
had
been
virginia
which
had
begun
to
feel
that
she
had
a
life
of
her
own
a
place
of
her
own
among
the
nations
suddenly
found
herself
given
away
like
some
worthless
chattel
to
two
of
the
king
favourites
earl
of
arlington
and
lord
culpeper
the
careless
king
owed
much
to
his
friends
who
had
rescued
him
from
beggary
and
set
him
upon
his
father
throne
here
was
an
easy
way
of
repaying
two
of
them
if
they
really
desired
that
wild
land
beyond
the
seas
where
only
savages
lived
and
where
the
weed
which
his
pompous
grandfather
had
disliked
so
much
grew
why
they
should
have
it
so
he
carelessly
signed
his
royal
name
and
for
a
yearly
rent
of
forty
shillings
all
that
dominion
of
land
and
water
commonly
called
virginia
was
theirs
for
the
space
of
years
it
was
but
a
scratch
of
the
pen
to
the
king
it
was
everything
to
the
virginians
and
when
news
of
it
reached
them
all
virginia
was
ablaze
they
who
had
clung
to
the
king
in
his
evil
days
they
who
had
been
the
last
people
belonging
to
england
to
submit
to
the
commonwealth
to
be
thus
tossed
to
his
favourites
like
some
useless
toy
without
so
much
as
a
by
your
leave
they
would
not
suffer
it
and
they
sent
a
messenger
to
england
to
lay
their
case
before
the
king
as
to
charles
he
was
lazily
astonished
to
find
that
any
one
objected
to
such
a
little
trifle
and
with
his
usual
idle
good
nature
he
promised
that
it
should
be
altered
but
he
had
no
intention
of
hurrying
meanwhile
out
in
virginia
events
were
hastening
chapter
bacon
rebellion
for
some
time
now
the
indians
had
been
an
increasing
terror
to
the
white
men
they
had
grown
restless
and
uneasy
at
the
constantly
widening
borders
of
the
settlements
day
by
day
the
forest
was
cleared
the
cornfields
stretched
farther
and
farther
inland
and
the
redman
saw
himself
driven
farther
and
farther
from
his
so
anger
arose
in
the
redman
heart
he
lurked
in
the
forests
which
girded
the
lonely
farms
and
watching
his
opportunity
crept
stealthily
forth
to
slay
and
burn
settler
after
settler
was
slain
in
cold
blood
or
done
to
death
with
awful
tortures
and
his
pleasant
homestead
was
given
to
the
flames
day
by
day
the
tale
of
horror
grew
till
it
seemed
at
length
that
no
farm
along
the
borders
of
the
colony
was
safe
from
destruction
yet
the
governor
did
nothing
helplessly
the
virginians
raged
against
his
sloth
and
tyranny
he
was
a
traitor
to
his
trust
they
declared
and
feared
to
wage
war
on
the
indians
lest
it
should
spoil
his
fur
trade
with
them
but
that
was
not
so
a
deadlier
fear
than
that
kept
berkeley
idle
he
knew
how
his
tyranny
had
made
the
people
hate
him
and
he
feared
to
arm
them
and
lead
them
against
the
indians
lest
having
subdued
these
foes
they
should
turn
their
arms
against
him
but
the
men
of
virginia
were
seething
with
discontent
and
ripe
for
rebellion
all
they
wanted
was
a
leader
and
soon
they
found
one
this
leader
was
nathaniel
bacon
a
young
englishman
who
had
but
lately
come
to
the
colony
he
was
dashing
and
handsome
had
winning
ways
and
a
persuasive
tongue
he
was
the
very
man
for
a
popular
leader
and
soon
at
his
back
he
had
an
army
of
three
hundred
armed
settlers
one
and
all
at
his
devotion
bacon
then
sent
to
the
governor
asking
for
a
commission
to
go
against
the
indians
but
berkeley
put
him
off
with
one
excuse
after
another
until
at
length
goaded
into
rebellion
bacon
and
his
men
determined
to
set
out
commission
or
no
commission
but
they
had
not
gone
far
when
a
messenger
came
spurring
behind
them
in
hot
haste
he
came
with
a
proclamation
from
the
governor
denouncing
them
all
as
rebels
and
bidding
them
disperse
at
once
on
pain
of
forfeiting
their
lands
and
goods
some
obeyed
but
the
rest
went
on
with
bacon
and
only
returned
after
having
routed
the
indians
their
defeat
was
so
severe
that
the
battle
is
known
as
the
battle
of
bloody
run
because
it
was
said
the
blood
of
the
indians
made
red
the
stream
which
flowed
near
the
battlefield
the
indians
for
the
time
were
cowed
and
bacon
marched
slowly
home
with
his
men
meanwhile
berkeley
had
gathered
horses
and
men
and
had
ridden
out
to
crush
this
turbulent
youth
but
hearing
suddenly
that
the
people
had
risen
in
revolt
he
hastened
back
to
jamestown
with
all
speed
he
saw
he
must
do
something
to
appease
the
people
so
he
dissolved
the
house
of
burgesses
which
for
fourteen
years
had
done
his
bidding
and
ordered
a
new
election
this
pacified
the
people
somewhat
but
they
actually
elected
the
rebel
bacon
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
house
bacon
was
not
however
altogether
to
escape
the
consequences
of
his
bold
deeds
as
soon
as
he
returned
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
led
before
the
governor
the
stern
old
cavalier
received
this
rebel
with
cool
civility
bacon
he
said
have
you
forgot
to
be
a
gentleman
no
may
it
please
your
honour
answered
bacon
then
said
the
governor
i
will
take
your
parole
so
bacon
was
set
free
until
the
house
of
burgesses
should
meet
meantime
he
was
given
to
understand
that
if
he
made
open
confession
of
his
misdeeds
in
having
marched
against
the
indians
without
a
commission
he
would
be
forgiven
receive
his
commission
and
be
allowed
to
fight
the
indians
it
was
not
easy
to
make
this
proud
young
man
bend
his
knee
but
to
gain
his
end
bacon
consented
to
beg
forgiveness
for
what
he
deemed
no
offence
the
governor
meant
it
to
be
a
solemn
occasion
one
not
lightly
to
be
forgotten
so
when
the
burgesses
and
council
were
gathered
the
governor
stood
up
if
there
be
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
he
said
there
is
joy
now
for
we
have
a
penitent
sinner
come
before
us
call
mr
bacon
the
doors
were
thrown
wide
open
and
in
marched
bacon
tall
and
proud
looking
grave
indeed
but
little
like
a
repentant
sinner
at
the
bar
of
the
house
he
knelt
on
one
knee
and
reading
from
a
paper
written
out
for
him
confessed
his
crimes
begging
pardon
from
god
the
king
and
the
governor
when
his
clear
young
voice
ceased
the
old
governor
spoke
god
forgive
you
he
said
solemnly
i
forgive
you
three
times
he
repeated
the
words
and
was
silent
and
all
that
were
with
him
asked
one
of
the
council
yea
said
the
governor
and
all
that
were
with
him
thus
the
matter
seemed
ended
there
was
peace
again
and
the
house
could
now
proceed
to
further
business
part
of
that
business
was
to
settle
what
was
to
be
done
about
the
indian
war
some
of
the
people
hoped
that
they
might
get
help
from
friendly
indians
so
the
indian
queen
pamunky
had
been
asked
to
come
to
the
assembly
and
say
what
help
she
would
give
her
tribe
was
the
same
as
that
over
which
the
powhatan
had
ruled
so
long
ago
and
although
it
was
now
but
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
she
had
still
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
braves
at
command
whose
help
the
englishmen
were
anxious
to
gain
queen
pamunky
entered
the
assembly
with
great
dignity
and
with
an
air
of
majesty
walked
slowly
up
the
long
room
her
walk
was
so
graceful
her
gestures
so
courtly
that
every
one
looked
at
her
in
admiration
upon
her
head
she
wore
a
crown
of
black
and
white
wampum
her
robe
was
made
of
deer
skin
and
covered
her
from
shoulders
to
feet
the
edges
of
it
being
slit
into
fringes
six
inches
deep
at
her
right
hand
walked
an
english
interpreter
at
her
left
her
son
a
youth
of
twenty
when
queen
pamunky
reached
the
table
she
stood
still
looking
at
the
members
coldly
and
gravely
and
only
at
their
urgent
request
did
she
sit
down
beside
her
as
they
had
entered
the
room
stood
her
son
and
interpreter
on
either
hand
when
she
was
seated
the
chairman
asked
her
how
many
men
she
would
send
to
help
them
against
the
enemy
indians
all
those
present
were
quite
sure
that
she
understood
english
but
she
would
not
speak
to
the
chairman
direct
and
answered
him
through
her
interpreter
bidding
him
speak
to
her
son
the
young
indian
chieftain
however
also
refused
to
reply
so
again
the
queen
was
urged
to
say
how
many
men
she
could
send
for
some
minutes
she
sat
still
as
if
in
deep
thought
then
in
a
shrill
high
voice
full
of
passionate
fervour
and
trembling
as
if
with
tears
she
spoke
in
her
own
tongue
and
ever
and
anon
amid
the
tragic
torrent
of
sound
the
words
tatapatamoi
chepiack
tatapatamoi
chepiack
could
be
heard
few
present
understood
her
but
one
of
the
members
did
and
shook
his
head
sadly
what
she
says
is
too
true
to
our
shame
be
it
said
he
sighed
my
father
was
general
in
that
battle
of
which
she
speaks
tatapatamoi
was
her
husband
and
he
led
a
hundred
men
against
our
enemies
and
was
there
slain
with
most
of
his
company
and
from
that
day
to
this
no
recompense
has
been
given
to
her
therefore
she
upbraids
us
and
cries
is
dead
when
they
heard
the
reason
for
the
indian
queen
anger
many
were
filled
with
sympathy
for
her
the
chairman
however
was
a
crusty
old
fellow
and
he
was
quite
unmoved
by
the
poor
queen
passion
of
grief
and
anger
never
a
word
did
he
say
to
comfort
her
distress
not
a
sign
of
sympathy
did
he
give
he
rudely
brushed
aside
her
vehement
appeal
and
repeated
his
question
what
men
will
you
give
to
help
against
the
enemy
indians
with
quivering
nostrils
and
flashing
eyes
the
indian
queen
drew
herself
up
scornfully
she
looked
at
him
then
turned
her
face
away
and
sat
mute
three
times
he
repeated
his
question
then
in
a
low
disdainful
voice
her
head
still
turned
away
she
muttered
in
her
own
language
six
this
would
never
do
the
lumbering
old
chairman
argued
and
persuaded
while
the
dusky
queen
sat
sullenly
silent
at
length
she
uttered
one
word
as
scornfully
as
the
last
twelve
she
said
then
rising
she
walked
proudly
and
gravely
from
the
hall
thus
did
the
blundering
old
fellow
of
a
chairman
for
the
lack
of
a
few
kindly
words
turn
away
the
hearts
of
the
indians
and
lose
their
help
at
a
moment
when
it
was
sorely
needed
the
new
house
had
many
other
things
to
discuss
besides
the
indian
wars
and
the
people
who
had
been
kept
out
of
their
rights
for
so
long
now
made
up
for
lost
time
they
passed
laws
with
feverish
haste
they
restored
manhood
suffrage
did
away
with
many
class
privileges
and
in
various
ways
instituted
reforms
afterwards
these
laws
were
known
as
bacon
laws
but
meanwhile
bacon
was
preparing
a
new
surprise
for
every
one
one
morning
the
town
was
agog
with
news
bacon
has
fled
bacon
has
fled
cried
every
one
it
was
true
bacon
had
grown
tired
of
waiting
for
the
commission
which
never
came
so
he
was
off
to
raise
the
country
a
few
days
later
he
marched
back
again
at
the
head
of
six
hundred
men
at
two
one
bright
june
day
the
sounds
of
drum
and
trumpet
were
heard
mingled
with
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
general
bacon
as
folk
began
to
call
him
now
drew
up
his
men
not
an
arrow
flight
from
the
state
house
the
people
of
jamestown
rushed
to
the
spot
every
window
and
balcony
was
crowded
with
eager
excited
people
men
women
and
children
jostled
each
other
on
the
green
as
bacon
with
a
file
of
soldiers
on
either
hand
marched
to
the
state
house
the
old
governor
shaking
with
anger
came
out
to
meet
the
insolent
young
rebel
with
trembling
fingers
he
tore
at
the
fine
lace
ruffles
of
his
shirt
baring
his
breast
here
i
am
he
cried
shoot
me
god
is
a
fair
mark
shoot
me
shoot
me
he
repeated
in
a
frenzy
but
bacon
answered
peaceably
enough
no
may
it
please
your
honour
he
said
we
will
not
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
nor
of
any
other
man
we
are
come
for
a
commission
to
save
our
lives
from
the
indians
which
you
have
so
often
promised
and
now
we
will
have
it
before
we
go
but
when
the
stern
old
cavalier
refused
to
listen
to
him
bacon
too
lost
his
temper
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
sword
swore
he
would
kill
the
governor
council
assembly
and
all
rather
than
forego
his
commission
his
men
too
grew
impatient
and
filled
the
air
with
their
shouts
we
will
have
it
we
will
have
it
they
cried
at
the
same
time
pointing
their
loaded
guns
at
the
windows
of
the
state
house
minute
by
minute
the
uproar
increased
till
at
length
one
of
the
burgesses
going
to
a
window
waved
his
handkerchief
a
pacifeck
handkercher
a
quaint
old
record
calls
it
and
shouted
you
shall
have
it
you
shall
have
it
so
the
tumult
was
quieted
a
commission
was
drawn
up
making
bacon
of
the
army
against
the
indians
and
a
letter
was
written
to
the
king
praising
him
for
what
he
had
done
against
them
but
the
stern
old
governor
was
still
unbending
and
not
till
next
day
was
he
browbeaten
into
signing
both
papers
the
young
rebel
had
triumphed
but
berkeley
was
not
yet
done
with
him
for
the
same
ship
which
carried
the
letter
of
the
burgesses
to
the
king
also
carried
a
private
letter
from
berkeley
in
which
he
gave
his
own
account
of
the
business
i
have
for
above
thirty
years
governed
the
most
flourishing
country
the
sun
ever
shone
over
he
wrote
but
am
now
encompassed
with
rebellion
like
waters
and
as
soon
as
bacon
was
safely
away
and
at
grips
once
more
with
the
indians
the
governor
again
proclaimed
him
and
his
followers
to
be
rebels
and
traitors
bacon
had
crushed
the
indian
foe
when
this
news
was
brought
to
him
he
was
cut
to
the
quick
by
the
injustice
i
am
vexed
to
the
heart
he
said
for
to
think
that
while
i
am
hunting
indian
wolves
tigers
and
foxes
which
daily
destroy
our
harmless
sheep
and
lambs
that
i
and
those
with
me
should
be
pursued
with
a
full
cry
as
a
more
savage
and
no
less
ravenous
beast
so
now
in
dangerous
mood
he
marched
back
to
jamestown
things
were
looking
black
for
him
but
his
men
were
with
him
heart
and
soul
when
one
of
them
a
scotsman
named
drummond
was
warned
that
this
was
rebellion
he
replied
recklessly
i
am
in
over
shoes
i
will
be
in
over
boots
his
wife
was
even
more
bold
this
is
dangerous
work
said
some
one
and
england
will
have
something
to
say
to
it
then
sarah
drummond
picked
up
a
twig
and
snapping
it
in
two
threw
it
down
again
i
fear
the
power
of
england
no
more
than
that
broken
straw
she
cried
bacon
now
issued
a
manifesto
in
reply
to
berkeley
proclamation
declaring
that
he
and
his
followers
could
not
find
in
their
hearts
one
single
spot
of
rebellion
or
treason
let
truth
be
bold
he
cried
and
let
all
the
world
know
the
real
facts
of
this
matter
he
appealed
to
the
king
against
sir
william
who
had
levied
unjust
taxes
who
had
failed
to
protect
the
people
against
the
indians
who
had
traded
unjustly
with
them
and
done
much
evil
to
his
true
subjects
so
far
there
had
only
been
bitter
words
between
the
old
governor
and
the
young
rebel
and
bacon
had
never
drawn
his
sword
save
against
the
indians
now
he
turned
it
against
the
governor
and
marching
on
jamestown
burned
it
to
the
ground
and
berkeley
defeated
fled
to
accomac
everywhere
bacon
seemed
successful
and
from
jamestown
he
marched
northward
to
settle
affairs
there
also
after
his
own
measures
but
a
grim
and
captain
had
now
taken
up
arms
against
this
victorious
death
whom
even
the
greatest
soldier
must
obey
and
on
october
bacon
laid
down
his
sword
for
ever
he
had
been
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
rebellion
and
with
his
death
it
collapsed
swiftly
and
completely
bacon
was
now
beyond
the
governor
wrath
but
he
wreaked
his
vengeance
on
those
who
had
followed
him
for
long
months
the
rebels
were
hunted
and
hounded
and
when
caught
they
were
hanged
without
mercy
the
first
to
suffer
was
colonel
thomas
hansford
he
was
a
brave
man
and
a
gentleman
and
all
he
asked
was
that
he
might
be
shot
like
a
soldier
and
not
hanged
like
a
dog
but
the
wrathful
governor
would
not
listen
to
his
appeal
and
he
was
hanged
on
the
scaffold
he
spoke
to
those
around
praying
them
to
remember
that
he
died
a
loyal
subject
of
the
king
and
a
lover
of
his
country
he
has
been
called
the
first
martyr
to
american
liberty
another
young
major
named
cheesman
was
condemned
to
death
but
died
in
prison
some
say
by
poison
the
governor
when
he
was
brought
before
him
asked
fiercely
what
reason
had
you
for
rebellion
but
before
the
major
could
reply
his
young
wife
stepped
from
the
surrounding
crowd
and
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
before
the
governor
it
was
my
doing
she
i
persuaded
him
and
but
for
me
he
would
never
have
done
it
i
am
guilty
not
he
i
pray
you
therefore
let
me
be
hanged
and
he
be
pardoned
but
the
old
cavalier
heart
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
frenzy
of
hate
he
was
utterly
untouched
by
the
poor
lady
brave
and
sad
appeal
and
answered
her
only
with
bitter
insulting
words
drummond
too
was
taken
he
was
indeed
in
over
boots
and
fearless
to
the
last
the
governor
was
overjoyed
at
his
capture
and
with
mocking
ceremony
swept
his
hat
from
his
head
and
bowing
low
cried
exultantly
drummond
you
are
very
welcome
i
am
more
glad
to
see
you
than
any
man
in
virginia
drummond
you
shall
be
hanged
in
half
an
hour
what
your
honour
pleases
calmly
replied
drummond
and
so
he
died
it
seemed
as
if
the
governor
vengeance
would
never
be
satisfied
but
at
length
the
house
met
and
petitioned
him
to
spill
no
more
blood
for
said
one
of
the
members
had
we
let
him
alone
he
would
have
hanged
half
the
country
news
of
his
wild
doings
too
were
carried
home
and
reached
even
the
king
ears
the
old
fool
cried
he
has
hanged
more
men
in
that
naked
country
than
i
did
for
the
murder
of
my
father
so
berkeley
was
recalled
at
his
going
the
whole
colony
rejoiced
guns
were
fired
and
bonfires
lit
to
celebrate
the
passing
of
the
tyrant
berkeley
did
not
live
long
after
his
downfall
he
had
hoped
that
when
he
saw
the
king
and
explained
to
him
his
cause
that
he
would
be
again
received
into
favour
but
his
hopes
were
vain
the
king
refused
to
see
him
and
he
who
had
given
up
everything
even
good
name
and
fame
in
his
king
cause
died
a
few
months
later
chapter
the
story

golden
horseshoe

by
evil
government
and

good
bacon
laws
were
done

with
and
lord
culpeper
one
of
the
two
nobles
to
whom
charles
ii
had
given
virginia
came
out
as
governor
he
soon
showed
himself
a
greedy
tyrant
caring
nothing
for
the
happiness
of
his
people
and
bent
only
on
making
money
for
himself
other
governors
followed
him
many
of
them
worthless
some
never
taking
the
trouble
to
come
to
virginia
at
all
they
stayed
at
home
accepting
large
sums
of
money
and
letting
other
people
do
the
work
but
they
were
not
all
worthless
and
careless
some
were
good
and
one
of
the
best
was
a
scotsman
alexander
spotswood
he
was
a
lieutenant
governor
that
is
the
governor
in
name
was
the
earl
of
orkney
who
was
given
the
post
as
a
reward
for
his
great
services
as
a
soldier
but
he
never
crossed
the
atlantic
to
visit
his
noble
province
instead
he
sent
others
to
rule
for
him
they
were
in
fact
the
real
governors
although
they
were
called
lieutenant
governors
spotswood
loved
virginia
and
he
did
all
he
could
to
make
the
colony
prosperous
he
saw
that
the
land
was
rich
in
minerals
and
that
much
could
be
done
with
iron
ore
so
he
built
smelting
furnaces
and
altogether
was
so
eager
over
it
that
he
was
called
the
tubal
cain
of
virginia
for
tubal
cain
you
remember
was
an
instructor
of
every
artificer
in
brass
and
iron
spotswood
also
planted
vines
and
brought
over
a
colony
of
germans
to
teach
the
people
how
to
grow
them
properly
and
make
wine
it
was
he
too
who
first
explored
the
west
virginia
up
till
now
had
lain
between
the
sea
and
the
blue
range
of
mountains
which
cut
it
off
from
the
land
behind
to
the
english
that
was
a
land
utterly
unknown
all
they
knew
was
that
the
french
were
claiming
it
but
governor
spotswood
wanted
to
know
more
so
one
august
he
gathered
a
company
of
friends
and
set
forth
on
an
exploring
expedition
with
servants
and
indian
guides
they
made
a
party
of
about
fifty
or
so
and
a
jolly
company
they
were
they
hunted
by
the
way
and
camped
beneath
the
stars
there
was
no
lack
of
food
and
drink
and
it
was
more
like
a
prolonged
picnic
than
an
exploring
expedition
the
explorers
reached
the
blue
ridge
and
climbing
to
the
top
of
a
pass
looked
down
upon
the
beautiful
wild
valley
beyond
through
which
wound
a
shining
river
spotswood
called
the
river
the
euphrates
but
fortunately
the
name
did
not
stick
and
it
is
still
called
by
its
beautiful
indian
name
of
shenandoah
spotswood
named
the
highest
peak
he
saw
mount
george
in
honour
of
the
king
and
his
companions
gave
the
next
highest
peak
the
name
of
mount
alexander
in
honour
of
the
governor
whose
christian
name
was
alexander
then
they
went
down
into
the
valley
below
and
on
the
banks
of
the
river
they
buried
a
bottle
inside
which
they
had
put
a
paper
declaring
that
the
whole
valley
belonged
to
george
i
king
by
the
grace
of
god
of
great
britain
france
ireland
and
virginia
after
that
the
merry
party
turned
homewards
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
gap
took
a
last
look
at
the
fair
valley
of
the
unknown
west
and
then
went
down
once
more
into
the
familiar
plains
of
virginia
for
this
expedition
all
the
horses
were
shod
with
iron
a
thing
very
unusual
in
virginia
where
there
were
no
hard
or
stony
roads
so
as
a
remembrance
of
their
pleasant
time
together
spotswood
gave
each
of
his
companions
a
gold
horseshoe
set
with
precious
stones
for
nails
graven
upon
them
were
the
latin
words
sic
juvat
transcendere
montes
which
mean
thus
it
is
a
pleasure
to
cross
the
mountains
later
all
those
who
took
part
in
the
expedition
were
called
knights
of
the
golden
horseshoe
up
to
about
this
time
the
people
in
virginia
had
been
altogether
english
now
a
change
came
in
france
louis
xiv
was
persecuting
the
protestants
or
huguenots
as
they
were
called
he
ordered
them
all
to
become
catholics
or
die
and
he
forbade
them
to
leave
the
country
but
thousands
of
them
refused
to
give
up
their
religion
and
in
spite
of
the
commands
they
stole
away
from
the
country
by
secret
ways
many
of
them
found
a
refuge
in
america
in
the
north
of
ireland
which
had
been
settled
chiefly
by
scotsmen
the
presbyterians
were
being
persecuted
by
the
church
of
england
at
the
same
time
the
english
parliament
was
hampering
their
trade
with
unfair
laws
so
to
escape
from
this
double
persecution
many
fled
to
america
in
germany
too
the
protestants
were
being
persecuted
by
the
catholic
princes
they
too
fled
to
america
all
these
widely
varying
refugees
found
new
homes
in
other
colonies
as
well
as
in
virginia
as
we
shall
presently
hear
in
virginia
it
was
chiefly
to
the
shenandoah
valley
that
they
came
that
valley
which
spotswood
and
his
knights
of
the
golden
horseshoe
had
seen
and
claimed
for
king
george
the
coming
of
these
new
people
changed
virginia
a
good
deal
after
the
death
of
king
charles
the
coming
of
the
cavaliers
had
made
virginia
royalist
and
aristocratic
so
now
the
coming
of
those
persecuted
protestants
and
presbyterians
tended
to
make
it
democratic
that
is
the
coming
of
the
cavaliers
increased
the
number
of
those
who
believed
in
the
government
of
the
many
by
the
few
the
coming
of
the
european
protestants
increased
the
number
of
those
who
believed
in
the
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
so
in
the
house
of
burgesses
there
were
scenes
of
excitement
but
these
were
no
longer
in
jamestown
for
the
capital
had
been
removed
to
williamsburg
jamestown
you
remember
had
been
burned
by
bacon
lord
culpeper
however
rebuilt
it
but
a
few
years
later
it
was
again
burned
down
by
accident
it
had
never
been
a
healthy
spot
no
one
seemed
very
anxious
to
build
it
again
so
it
was
forsaken
and
williamsburg
became
and
remained
the
capital
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
today
all
that
is
left
of
jamestown
the
first
home
of
englishmen
in
america
is
the
ruin
of
the
church
part
iii
stories
of
new
england
chapter
the
story
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
while
the
colony
of
virginia
was
fighting
for
life
and
struggling
against
tyranny
other
colonies
were
taking
root
upon
the
wide
shores
of
america
you
will
remember
that
in
a
sort
of
double
company
of
adventurers
was
formed
in
england
one
branch
of
which
the
london
company
founded
jamestown
the
other
branch
the
plymouth
company
also
sent
out
an
expedition
and
tried
to
found
a
colony
at
the
mouth
of
the
kennebec
river
but
it
was
a
failure
some
of
the
adventurers
were
so
discouraged
with
the
cold
and
bleak
appearance
of
the
land
that
they
sailed
home
again
in
the
ship
which
had
brought
them
out
only
about
or
so
stayed
on
the
winter
was
long
and
cold
and
they
were
so
weary
of
it
so
homesick
and
miserable
that
when
in
the
spring
a
ship
came
out
with
provisions
they
all
sailed
home
again
they
had
nothing
good
to
say
of
virginia
as
the
whole
land
was
then
called
by
the
english
it
was
far
too
cold
and
no
place
for
englishmen
they
said
still
some
of
the
adventurers
of
the
plymouth
company
did
not
give
up
hope
of
founding
a
colony
and
nine
years
after
this
first
attempt
our
old
friend
captain
john
smith
recovered
from
his
wounds
received
in
virginia
and
as
vigorous
as
ever
sailed
out
to
north
virginia
in
the
first
place
be
went
to
take
whales
and
also
to
make
trials
of
a
mine
of
gold
and
of
copper
and
in
the
long
run
he
hoped
to
found
a
colony
it
was
he
who
changed
the
name
from
north
virginia
to
new
england
by
which
name
it
has
ever
since
been
known
he
also
named
the
great
river
which
he
found
there
charles
river
after
prince
charles
who
later
became
king
charles
i
and
all
along
the
coast
he
marked
places
with
the
names
of
english
towns
one
of
which
he
named
plymouth
but
smith
did
not
succeed
in
founding
a
colony
in
new
england
and
several
adventurers
who
followed
him
had
no
better
success
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
were
great
and
in
order
to
found
a
colony
on
that
inhospitable
coast
men
of
tremendous
purpose
and
endurance
were
needed
at
length
these
men
appeared
nowadays
a
man
may
believe
what
he
likes
either
in
the
way
of
politics
or
religion
he
may
belong
to
any
political
party
he
pleases
or
he
may
belong
to
none
he
may
write
and
make
speeches
about
his
opinions
probably
no
one
will
listen
to
him
certainly
he
will
not
be
imprisoned
for
mere
opinions
it
is
the
same
with
religion
a
man
may
go
to
any
church
he
likes
or
go
to
none
he
may
write
books
or
preach
sermons
and
no
one
will
hinder
him
but
in
the
days
of
king
james
things
were
very
different
in
those
days
there
was
little
freedom
either
in
thought
or
action
in
religion
or
politics
as
we
have
seen
king
james
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
his
colony
should
be
and
free
to
make
laws
for
itself
consequently
he
took
its
charter
away
in
religion
it
was
just
the
same
in
england
at
the
reformation
the
king
had
been
made
head
of
the
church
and
if
people
did
not
believe
what
the
king
and
clergy
told
them
to
believe
they
were
sure
sooner
or
later
to
be
punished
for
it
now
in
england
more
and
more
people
began
to
think
for
themselves
on
matters
of
religion
more
and
more
people
found
it
difficult
to
believe
as
king
and
clergy
wished
them
to
believe
some
found
the
church
of
england
far
too
like
the
old
church
of
rome
they
wanted
to
do
away
with
all
pomp
and
ceremony
and
have
things
quite
simple
they
did
not
wish
to
separate
from
the
church
they
only
wanted
to
make
the
church
clean
and
pure
of
all
its
errors
so
they
got
the
name
of
puritans
others
however
quite
despaired
of
making
the
church
pure
they
desired
to
leave
it
altogether
and
set
up
a
church
of
their
own
they
were
called
separatists
or
sometimes
from
the
name
of
a
man
who
was
one
of
their
chief
leaders
brownists
these
brownists
did
not
want
to
have
bishops
and
priests
and
they
would
not
own
the
king
as
head
of
the
church
instead
of
going
to
church
they
used
to
meet
together
in
private
houses
there
to
pray
to
god
in
the
manner
in
which
their
own
hearts
told
them
was
right
this
of
course
was
considered
treason
and
foul
wickedness
so
on
all
hands
the
brownists
were
persecuted
they
were
fined
and
imprisoned
some
were
even
hanged
but
all
this
persecution
was
in
vain
and
the
number
of
separatists
instead
of
decreasing
increased
as
years
went
on
now
at
scrooby
a
tiny
village
in
nottinghamshire
england
and
in
other
villages
round
both
in
nottinghamshire
and
lincolnshire
there
were
a
number
of
separatists
every
sunday
these
people
would
walk
long
distances
to
some
appointed
place
very
likely
to
scrooby
or
to
babworth
where
there
was
a
grave
and
reverent
preacher
to
hold
their
meetings
but
they
were
never
left
long
in
peace
they
were
hunted
and
persecuted
on
every
side
till
at
length
they
decided
to
go
to
holland
where
they
heard
there
was
freedom
of
religion
for
all
men
to
many
of
them
this
was
a
desperate
adventure
in
those
days
few
men
traveled
for
the
most
part
people
lived
and
died
without
once
leaving
their
native
villages
to
go
into
a
new
country
to
learn
a
new
language
to
get
their
living
they
know
not
how
seemed
to
some
a
misery
almost
worse
than
death
still
they
determined
to
go
such
was
their
eagerness
to
serve
god
aright
the
going
was
not
easy
they
were
harassed
and
hindered
in
every
fashion
again
and
again
evil
men
cheated
them
and
robbed
them
of
almost
all
they
possessed
leaving
them
starving
and
penniless
upon
the
sea
shore
but
at
length
overcoming
all
difficulties
in
one
way
or
another
they
all
reached
amsterdam
even
here
however
they
did
not
find
the
full
freedom
and
peace
which
they
desired
and
they
next
moved
to
leyden
they
found
it
a
beautiful
city
and
of
a
sweet
situation
here
they
settled
down
and
for
some
years
lived
in
comfort
earning
their
living
by
weaving
and
such
employments
and
worshipping
god
at
peace
in
their
own
fashion
but
after
about
eleven
or
twelve
years
they
began
once
more
to
think
of
moving
they
had
many
reasons
for
this
one
being
that
if
they
stayed
longer
in
holland
their
children
and
grandchildren
would
forget
how
to
speak
english
and
in
a
few
generations
they
would
no
longer
be
english
but
dutch
so
they
determined
to
go
to
some
place
where
they
could
still
remain
english
and
yet
worship
god
as
they
thought
right
and
the
place
their
thoughts
turned
to
was
the
vast
and
unpeopled
country
of
america
but
which
part
of
america
they
could
not
at
first
decide
after
much
talk
however
they
at
length
decided
to
ask
the
virginian
company
to
allow
them
to
settle
in
their
land
but
as
a
separate
colony
so
that
they
might
still
have
religious
freedom
two
messengers
were
therefore
despatched
to
london
to
arrange
matters
with
the
company
the
virginian
company
was
quite
willing
to
have
these
separatists
as
settlers
but
do
what
they
would
they
could
not
get
the
king
to
promise
them
freedom
to
worship
god
all
that
they
could
wring
from
him
was
a
promise
that
he
would
take
no
notice
of
them
so
long
as
they
behaved
peaceably
to
allow
or
tolerate
them
by
his
public
authority
under
his
broad
seal
was
not
to
be
thought
of
that
was
the
best
the
virginian
company
or
any
of
their
friends
could
do
for
the
separatists
and
with
this
answer
the
messengers
were
obliged
to
return
to
leyden
when
the
english
men
and
women
there
heard
it
they
were
much
disturbed
some
felt
that
without
better
assurance
of
peace
they
would
be
foolish
to
leave
their
safe
refuge
but
the
greater
part
decided
that
poor
though
the
assurance
was
they
would
be
well
to
go
trusting
in
god
to
bring
them
safely
out
of
all
their
troubles
and
after
all
they
reflected
a
seal
as
broad
as
the
house
floor
would
not
serve
the
turn
if
james
did
not
wish
to
keep
his
promise
so
little
trust
did
they
put
in
princes
and
their
oaths
so
it
was
decided
to
go
to
the
new
world
and
after
much
trouble
everything
was
got
ready
a
little
ship
called
the
speedwell
was
bought
and
fitted
up
then
those
who
had
determined
to
go
went
down
to
the
sea
shore
accompanied
by
all
their
friends
their
hearts
were
heavy
as
they
left
the
beautiful
city
which
had
been
their
home
for
the
last
twelve
years
but
they
knew
that
they
were
pilgrims
and
strangers
upon
the
earth
and
they
looked
only
to
find
in
heaven
an
abiding
place
so
steadfastly
they
set
their
faces
towards
the
sea
they
went
on
board
their
friends
following
sorrowfully
then
came
the
sad
parting
they
clung
to
each
other
with
tears
their
words
of
farewell
and
prayers
broken
by
sobs
it
was
so
pitiful
a
sight
that
even
among
the
dutchmen
who
looked
on
there
was
scarce
a
dry
eye
at
length
the
time
came
when
the
last
farewell
had
to
be
said
then
their
pastor
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
deck
and
as
they
knelt
round
him
he
lifted
his
hands
to
heaven
and
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
prayed
god
to
bless
them
all
so
the
sails
were
hoisted
and
the
speedwell
sailed
away
to
southampton
here
she
found
the
mayflower
awaiting
her
and
the
two
set
forth
together
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
the
captain
of
the
speedwell
complained
that
his
ship
was
leaking
so
badly
that
he
dared
not
go
on
so
both
ships
put
in
to
dartmouth
and
here
the
speedwell
was
thoroughly
overhauled
and
mended
and
again
they
set
out
but
still
the
captain
declared
that
the
speedwell
was
leaking
so
once
more
the
pilgrims
put
back
this
time
to
plymouth
and
here
it
was
decided
that
the
speedwell
was
unseaworthy
and
unfit
to
venture
across
the
great
ocean
that
she
was
a
rotten
little
boat
is
fairly
certain
but
it
is
also
fairly
certain
that
the
captain
did
not
want
to
sail
to
america
and
therefore
he
made
the
worst
instead
of
the
best
of
his
ship
if
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
want
to
cross
the
ocean
he
now
had
his
way
for
the
speedwell
was
sent
back
to
london
with
all
those
who
had
already
grown
tired
of
the
venture
or
who
had
grown
fearful
because
of
the
many
mishaps
and
the
mayflower
taking
the
rest
of
the
passengers
from
the
speedwell
and
as
many
of
the
stores
as
she
could
find
room
for
proceeded
upon
her
voyage
alone
among
those
who
sailed
in
her
were
captain
miles
standish
and
master
mullins
with
his
fair
young
daughter
priscilla
i
daresay
you
have
read
the
story
longfellow
made
about
them
and
john
alden
at
the
first
john
alden
did
not
go
as
a
pilgrim
he
was
hired
at
southampton
as
a
cooper
merely
for
the
voyage
and
was
free
to
go
home
again
if
he
wished
but
he
stayed
and
as
we
know
from
longfellow
poem
he
married
priscilla
now
at
length
these
pilgrim
fathers
as
we
have
learned
to
call
them
were
really
on
their
way
but
all
the
trouble
about
the
speedwell
had
meant
a
terrible
loss
of
time
and
although
the
pilgrims
bad
left
holland
in
july
it
was
september
before
they
finally
set
sail
from
plymouth
and
their
voyage
was
really
begun
and
now
instead
of
having
fair
they
had
foul
weather
for
days
and
nights
with
every
sail
reefed
they
were
driven
hither
and
thither
by
the
wind
were
battered
and
beaten
by
cruel
waves
and
tossed
helplessly
from
side
to
side
at
length
after
two
months
of
terror
and
hardships
they
sighted
the
shores
of
america
they
had
however
been
driven
far
out
of
their
course
and
instead
of
being
near
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
river
and
within
the
area
granted
to
the
virginian
company
they
were
much
further
north
near
cape
cod
and
within
the
area
granted
to
the
plymouth
company
where
they
had
really
no
legal
right
to
land
so
although
they
were
joyful
indeed
to
see
land
they
decided
to
sail
southward
to
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
more
especially
as
the
weather
was
now
better
soon
however
as
they
sailed
south
they
found
themselves
among
dangerous
shoals
and
roaring
breakers
and
being
in
terror
of
shipwreck
they
turned
back
again
and
when
they
once
more
reached
the
shelter
of
cape
cod
harbour
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
most
heartily
thanked
god
who
had
brought
them
safely
over
the
furious
ocean
and
delivered
them
from
all
its
perils
and
miseries
they
vowed
no
more
to
risk
the
fury
of
the
tempest
but
to
settle
where
they
were
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
make
things
right
with
the
plymouth
company
later
on
so
in
the
little
cabin
of
the
mayflower
the
pilgrims
held
a
meeting
at
which
they
chose
a
governor
and
drew
up
rules
which
they
all
promised
to
obey
for
the
government
of
the
colony
but
this
done
they
found
it
difficult
to
decide
just
what
would
be
the
best
place
for
their
little
town
and
they
spent
a
month
or
more
exploring
the
coast
round
about
at
length
they
settled
upon
a
spot
on
captain
john
smith
map
it
was
already
marked
plymouth
and
so
the
pilgrims
decided
to
call
the
town
plymouth
because
of
this
and
also
because
plymouth
was
the
last
town
in
england
at
which
they
had
touched
so
here
they
all
went
ashore
choosing
as
a
landing
place
a
flat
rock
which
may
be
seen
to
this
day
and
which
is
now
known
as
the
plymouth
rock
which
had
been
to
their
feet
as
a
doorstep
into
a
world
of
a
nation
the
pilgrim
fathers
had
now
safely
passed
the
perils
of
the
sea
but
many
more
troubles
and
miseries
were
in
store
for
them
for
hundreds
of
miles
the
country
lay
barren
and
untilled
inhabited
only
by
wild
redmen
the
nearest
british
settlement
being
five
hundred
miles
away
there
was
no
one
upon
the
shore
to
greet
them
no
friendly
lights
no
smoke
arising
from
cheerful
cottage
fires
no
sign
of
habitation
far
or
near
it
was
a
silent
coast
upon
which
they
had
set
foot
the
weather
was
bitterly
cold
and
the
frost
so
keen
that
even
their
clothes
were
frozen
stiff
and
ere
these
pilgrims
could
find
a
shelter
from
the
winter
blasts
trees
had
to
be
felled
and
hewn
for
the
building
of
their
houses
it
was
enough
to
make
the
stoutest
heart
quake
yet
not
one
among
this
little
band
of
pilgrims
flinched
or
thought
of
turning
back
they
were
made
of
sterner
stuff
than
that
and
they
put
all
their
trust
in
god
may
not
and
ought
not
the
children
of
those
fathers
rightly
say
writes
william
bradford
who
was
their
governor
for
years
our
fathers
were
englishmen
which
came
over
this
great
ocean
and
were
ready
to
perish
in
the
wilderness
but
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
he
heard
their
voice
the
winter
was
an
unusually
severe
one
and
so
having
no
homes
to
shelter
them
or
comfort
of
any
kind
many
of
the
pilgrims
died
many
more
became
seriously
ill
indeed
at
one
time
there
were
not
more
than
six
or
seven
out
of
a
hundred
and
more
who
were
well
and
able
to
work
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
wonderful
devotion
and
loving
kindness
of
these
few
the
whole
colony
might
have
perished
miserably
but
these
few
worked
with
a
will
felling
trees
cooking
meals
caring
for
the
sick
both
day
and
night
the
first
winter
the
pilgrim
fathers
it
was
said
endured
a
wonderful
deal
of
misery
with
infinite
patience
but
at
length
spring
came
and
with
the
coming
of
warmth
and
sunshine
the
sickness
disappeared
the
sun
seemed
to
put
new
life
into
every
one
so
when
in
april
the
mayflower
which
had
been
in
harbour
all
winter
sailed
homeward
not
one
of
the
pilgrims
sailed
with
her
the
little
ship
was
the
last
link
with
home
they
had
but
to
step
on
board
to
be
wafted
back
to
the
green
hedgerows
and
meadows
gay
with
daisies
and
buttercups
in
dear
old
england
it
was
a
terrible
temptation
yet
not
one
yielded
to
it
with
tears
streaming
down
their
faces
the
pilgrims
knelt
upon
the
shore
and
saw
the
mayflower
go
following
her
with
prayers
and
blessings
until
she
was
out
of
sight
then
they
went
back
to
their
daily
labours
only
when
they
looked
out
to
sea
the
harbour
seemed
very
empty
with
no
friendly
little
vessel
lying
there
meanwhile
among
all
the
miseries
of
the
winter
there
had
been
one
bright
spot
the
pilgrims
had
made
friends
with
the
indians
they
had
often
noticed
with
fear
redmen
skulking
about
at
the
edge
watching
them
once
or
twice
when
they
had
left
tools
lying
about
they
had
been
stolen
but
whenever
they
tried
to
get
speech
with
the
indians
they
fled
away
what
was
their
surprise
then
when
one
morning
an
indian
walked
boldly
into
the
camp
and
spoke
to
them
in
broken
english
he
told
them
that
his
name
was
samoset
and
that
he
was
the
englishmen
friend
he
also
said
he
could
tell
them
of
another
indian
called
squanto
who
could
speak
better
english
than
he
could
this
squanto
had
been
stolen
away
from
his
home
by
a
wicked
captain
who
intended
to
sell
him
as
a
slave
to
spain
but
he
had
escaped
to
england
and
later
by
the
help
of
englishmen
had
been
brought
back
to
his
home
all
his
tribe
however
had
meantime
been
swept
away
by
a
plague
and
now
only
he
remained
samoset
also
said
that
his
great
chief
named
massasoit
or
yellow
feather
wished
to
make
friends
with
the
palefaces
the
settlers
were
well
pleased
to
find
the
indian
ready
to
be
friendly
and
giving
him
presents
of
a
few
beads
and
bits
of
coloured
cloth
they
sent
him
away
happy
but
very
soon
he
returned
bringing
squanto
and
the
chief
yellow
feather
with
him
then
there
was
a
very
solemn
the
savages
gorgeous
in
paint
and
feathers
sat
beside
the
englishmen
in
their
tall
black
hats
and
sober
clothes
and
together
they
swore
friendship
and
peace
and
so
long
as
yellow
feather
lived
this
peace
lasted
after
the
meeting
yellow
feather
went
home
to
his
own
wigwams
which
were
about
forty
miles
away
but
squanto
stayed
with
the
englishmen
he
taught
them
how
to
plant
corn
he
showed
them
where
to
fish
and
hunt
he
was
their
guide
through
the
pathless
forests
he
was
their
staunch
and
faithful
friend
and
never
left
them
till
he
died
even
then
he
feared
to
be
parted
from
his
white
friends
and
he
begged
them
to
pray
god
that
he
too
might
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
englishmen
heaven
besides
yellow
feather
and
his
tribe
there
were
other
indians
who
lived
to
the
east
of
the
settlement
and
they
were
by
no
means
so
friendly
at
harvest
time
they
used
to
steal
the
corn
from
the
fields
and
otherwise
harass
the
workers
as
they
went
unpunished
they
grew
ever
bolder
until
at
length
one
day
their
chief
canonicus
sent
a
messenger
to
the
governor
with
a
bundle
of
arrows
tied
about
with
a
large
snakeskin
this
was
meant
as
a
challenge
but
the
governor
was
not
to
be
frightened
by
such
threats
he
sent
back
the
snakeskin
stuffed
with
bullets
and
gunpowder
and
with
it
a
bold
message
if
you
would
rather
have
war
than
peace
he
said
you
can
begin
when
you
like
but
we
have
done
you
no
wrong
and
we
do
not
fear
you
when
the
chief
heard
the
message
and
saw
the
gunpowder
and
bullets
he
was
far
too
much
afraid
to
go
to
war
he
was
too
frightened
to
touch
the
snakeskin
or
even
allow
it
to
remain
in
his
country
but
sent
it
back
again
at
once
this
warlike
message
however
made
the
settlers
more
careful
and
they
built
a
strong
fence
around
their
little
town
with
gates
in
it
which
were
shut
and
guarded
at
night
thus
the
pilgrims
had
peace
with
the
redmen
they
had
also
set
matters
right
with
the
plymouth
company
and
had
received
from
them
a
patent
or
charter
allowing
them
to
settle
in
new
england
other
pilgrims
came
out
from
home
from
time
to
time
and
the
little
colony
prospered
and
grew
though
slowly
they
were
a
grave
and
stern
little
company
obeying
their
governor
fearing
god
keeping
the
sabbath
and
regarding
all
other
feast
days
as
popish
and
of
the
evil
one
it
is
told
how
one
christmas
day
the
governor
called
every
one
out
to
work
as
usual
but
some
of
the
newcomers
to
the
colony
objected
that
it
was
against
their
conscience
to
work
on
christmas
day
the
governor
looked
gravely
at
them
if
you
make
it
a
matter
of
conscience
he
said
i
will
release
you
from
work
upon
this
day
until
you
are
better
taught
upon
the
matter
then
he
led
the
others
away
to
fell
trees
and
saw
wood
but
when
at
noon
he
returned
he
found
those
whose
tender
consciences
had
not
allowed
them
to
work
playing
at
ball
and
other
games
in
the
streets
so
he
went
to
them
and
took
away
their
balls
and
other
toys
for
said
he
it
is
against
my
conscience
that
you
should
play
while
others
work
and
such
was
the
power
of
the
governor
that
he
was
quietly
obeyed
and
we
are
told
since
that
time
nothing
hath
been
attempted
that
way
at
least
openly
they
were
stern
these
old
settlers
and
perhaps
to
our
way
of
thinking
narrow
and
they
denied
themselves
much
that
is
lovely
in
life
and
quite
innocent
yet
we
must
look
back
at
them
with
admiration
no
people
ever
left
their
homes
to
go
into
exile
for
nobler
ends
no
colony
was
ever
founded
in
a
braver
fashion
and
it
is
with
some
regret
we
remember
that
these
brave
pilgrim
fathers
have
given
a
name
to
no
state
in
the
great
union
for
the
colony
of
plymouth
having
held
on
its
simple
severe
way
for
many
years
was
at
length
swallowed
up
by
one
of
its
great
neighbours
and
became
part
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
but
that
was
not
till
meanwhile
because
it
was
the
first
of
the
new
england
colonies
to
be
founded
it
was
often
called
the
old
colony
chapter
the
founding
of
massachusetts
for
ten
years
after
the
coming
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
charters
were
constantly
granted
to
adventurers
of
one
kind
or
another
for
the
founding
of
colonies
in
new
england
and
driven
by
the
tyranny
of
king
james
and
of
his
son
charles
i
small
companies
of
puritans
began
to
follow
the
example
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
go
out
to
new
england
there
to
seek
freedom
to
worship
god
for
king
james
although
brought
up
as
a
presbyterian
himself
was
bitter
against
the
puritans
i
shall
make
them
conform
themselves
he
had
said
or
i
will
harry
them
out
of
the
land
and
as
he
could
not
make
them
conform
he
harried
them
so
that
many
were
glad
to
leave
the
land
to
escape
tyranny
king
james
has
been
called
the
british
solomon
but
he
did
some
amazingly
foolish
things
this
persecution
of
the
puritans
was
one
yet
by
it
he
helped
to
form
a
great
nation
so
perhaps
he
was
not
so
foolish
after
all
as
has
been
said
many
companies
were
formed
many
land
charters
granted
for
northern
virginia
or
new
england
as
it
was
now
called
at
length
a
company
of
puritans
under
the
name
of
the
massachusetts
bay
company
got
a
charter
from
charles
i
granting
them
a
large
tract
of
land
from
three
miles
south
of
the
charles
river
to
three
miles
north
of
the
merrimac
and
as
far
west
as
the
pacific
of
course
no
one
in
those
days
realised
what
a
huge
tract
that
would
be
for
no
man
yet
guessed
how
great
a
continent
america
was
or
by
what
thousands
of
miles
the
pacific
was
separated
from
the
atlantic
this
charter
was
not
unlike
that
given
to
virginia
but
there
was
one
important
difference
nowhere
in
the
charter
did
it
say
that
the
seat
of
government
must
be
in
england
so
when
charles
dismissed
his
parliament
vowing
that
if
the
members
would
not
do
as
he
wished
he
would
rule
without
them
a
great
many
puritans
decided
to
leave
the
country
they
decided
also
to
take
their
charter
with
them
and
remove
the
company
of
massachusetts
bay
bag
and
baggage
to
new
england
charles
did
nothing
to
stop
them
perhaps
at
the
time
he
was
pleased
to
see
so
many
powerful
puritans
leave
the
country
for
without
them
he
was
all
the
freer
to
go
his
own
way
so
in
the
spring
of
more
than
a
thousand
set
sail
taking
with
them
their
cattle
and
household
goods
many
of
these
were
cultured
gentlemen
who
were
thus
giving
up
money
ease
and
position
in
order
to
gain
freedom
of
religion
they
were
not
poor
labourers
or
artisans
not
even
for
the
most
part
traders
and
merchants
they
chose
as
governor
for
the
first
year
a
suffolk
gentleman
named
john
winthrop
a
new
governor
was
chosen
every
year
but
john
winthrop
held
the
post
many
times
twice
being
elected
three
years
in
succession
although
we
may
think
that
he
was
narrow
in
some
things
he
was
a
man
of
calm
judgment
and
even
temper
and
was
in
many
ways
a
good
governor
from
the
day
he
set
forth
from
england
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
kept
a
diary
and
it
is
from
this
diary
that
we
learn
nearly
all
we
know
of
the
early
days
of
the
colony
it
was
in
june
of
that
winthrop
and
his
company
landed
at
salem
and
although
there
were
already
little
settlements
at
salem
and
elsewhere
this
may
be
taken
as
the
real
founding
of
massachusetts
almost
at
once
winthrop
decided
that
salem
would
not
be
a
good
centre
for
the
colony
and
he
moved
southward
to
the
charles
river
where
he
finally
settled
on
a
little
hilly
peninsula
there
a
township
was
founded
and
given
the
name
of
boston
after
the
town
of
boston
in
lincolnshire
from
which
many
of
the
settlers
had
come
although
these
settlers
had
more
money
and
more
knowledge
of
trading
the
colony
did
not
altogether
escape
the
miseries
which
every
other
colony
had
so
far
suffered
and
less
than
the
founders
of
plymouth
some
fled
back
again
to
england
but
they
were
only
a
few
and
for
the
most
part
the
new
settlers
remained
and
prospered
these
newcomers
were
not
separatists
like
the
pilgrim
fathers
but
puritans
when
they
left
england
they
had
no
intention
of
separating
themselves
from
the
church
of
england
they
had
only
desired
a
simpler
service
but
when
they
landed
in
america
they
did
in
fact
separate
from
the
church
of
england
england
was
so
far
away
the
great
ocean
was
between
them
and
all
the
laws
of
church
and
king
it
seemed
easy
to
cast
them
off
and
they
did
so
bishops
were
done
away
with
great
parts
of
the
common
prayer
book
were
rejected
and
the
service
as
a
whole
made
much
more
simple
and
as
they
wished
to
keep
their
colony
free
of
people
who
did
not
think
as
they
did
the
founders
of
massachusetts
made
a
law
that
only
church
members
might
have
a
vote
with
the
plymouth
pilgrims
however
separatists
though
they
were
these
puritans
were
on
friendly
terms
the
governors
of
the
two
colonies
visited
each
other
to
discuss
matters
of
religion
and
trade
and
each
treated
the
other
with
great
respect
and
ceremony
we
read
how
when
governor
winthrop
went
to
visit
governor
bradford
the
chief
people
of
plymouth
came
forth
to
meet
him
without
the
town
and
led
him
to
the
governor
house
there
he
and
his
companions
were
entertained
in
goodly
fashion
feasting
every
day
and
holding
pious
disputations
then
when
he
departed
again
the
governor
of
plymouth
with
the
pastor
and
elders
accompanied
him
half
a
mile
out
of
the
town
in
the
dark
but
although
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
were
friendly
enough
with
dissenters
beyond
their
borders
they
soon
showed
that
within
their
borders
there
was
to
be
no
other
church
than
that
which
they
had
set
up
two
brothers
for
instance
who
wanted
to
have
the
prayer
book
used
in
full
were
calmly
told
that
new
england
was
no
place
for
them
and
they
were
shipped
home
again
later
a
minister
named
roger
williams
was
banished
from
massachusetts
for
he
preached
that
there
ought
to
be
no
connection
between
church
and
state
that
a
man
was
responsible
to
god
alone
for
his
opinions
and
that
no
man
had
a
right
to
take
from
or
give
to
another
a
vote
because
of
the
church
to
which
he
belonged
it
seemed
to
him
a
deadly
sin
to
have
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
church
of
england
a
sin
for
which
every
one
ought
to
do
public
penance
he
also
said
that
the
land
of
america
belonged
to
the
natives
and
not
to
the
king
of
england
therefore
the
king
of
england
could
not
possibly
give
it
to
the
settlers
and
they
ought
to
bargain
for
it
with
the
natives
otherwise
they
could
have
no
right
to
it
this
idea
seemed
perfectly
preposterous
to
those
old
settlers
for
said
they
he
chargeth
king
james
to
have
told
a
solemn
public
lie
because
in
his
patent
he
blessed
god
that
he
was
the
first
christian
prince
that
had
discovered
this
land
they
might
think
little
enough
of
their
king
in
their
hearts
but
it
was
not
for
a
mere
nobody
to
start
such
a
ridiculous
theory
as
this
we
looking
back
can
see
that
williams
was
a
good
and
pious
man
a
man
before
his
time
right
in
many
of
his
ideas
though
not
very
wise
perhaps
in
his
way
of
pressing
them
upon
others
who
did
not
understand
them
but
to
his
fellow
colonists
he
seemed
nothing
but
a
firebrand
and
a
dangerous
heretic
so
they
bade
him
be
gone
out
of
their
borders
he
went
southward
to
what
is
now
rhode
island
made
friends
with
the
indians
there
bought
from
them
some
land
and
founded
the
town
of
providence
chapter
the
story
of
harry
vane
about
this
time
there
came
to
massachusetts
a
handsome
young
adventurer
named
sir
harry
vane
his
face
was
comely
and
fair
and
his
thick
brown
hair
curly
and
long
so
that
he
looked
more
like
a
cavalier
than
a
puritan
he
was
in
fact
the
eldest
son
of
a
cavalier
one
of
the
king
chosen
councilors
but
in
spite
of
his
birth
and
upbringing
in
spite
even
of
his
looks
harry
vane
was
a
puritan
and
he
gave
up
all
the
splendour
of
life
at
court
he
left
father
and
mother
and
fortune
and
came
to
new
england
for
conscience
sake
sir
henry
vane
hath
as
good
as
lost
his
eldest
son
who
is
gone
to
new
england
for
conscience
sake
wrote
a
friend
he
likes
not
the
discipline
of
the
church
of
england
none
of
our
ministers
would
give
him
the
sacrament
standing
no
persuasions
of
our
bishops
nor
authority
of
his
parents
could
prevail
with
him
let
him
go
as
soon
as
harry
vane
arrived
in
massachusetts
he
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
colony
and
perhaps
because
of
his
great
name
as
much
as
his
fair
face
men
who
had
far
more
experience
listened
to
his
youthful
advice
and
bowed
to
his
judgment
and
before
six
months
were
passed
he
although
a
mere
lad
of
was
chosen
as
governor
a
new
governor
you
remember
was
chosen
every
year
at
home
harry
vane
had
been
accustomed
to
the
pomp
and
splendour
of
courts
and
now
he
began
to
keep
far
greater
state
as
governor
than
any
one
had
done
before
him
because
he
was
son
and
heir
to
a
privy
councilor
in
england
the
ships
in
the
harbour
fired
a
salute
when
he
was
elected
and
when
he
went
to
church
or
court
of
justice
a
bodyguard
of
four
soldiers
marched
before
him
wearing
steel
corslet
and
cap
and
carrying
halberds
he
made
too
a
sort
of
royal
progress
through
his
little
domain
visiting
all
the
settlements
but
although
begun
with
such
pomp
vane
year
of
office
was
by
no
means
a
peaceful
one
he
was
young
and
inexperienced
and
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
deal
with
questions
which
even
the
oldest
among
the
settlers
found
hard
to
settle
yet
with
boyish
presumption
he
set
himself
to
the
task
and
although
he
failed
he
left
his
mark
on
the
life
of
the
colony
his
was
one
more
voice
raised
in
the
cause
of
freedom
his
was
one
more
hand
pointing
the
way
to
toleration
but
he
was
too
tempestuous
too
careless
of
tact
too
eager
to
hurry
to
the
good
end
so
instead
of
keeping
the
colony
with
him
he
created
dissension
people
took
sides
some
eagerly
supporting
the
young
governor
but
a
far
larger
party
as
eagerly
opposing
him
so
after
nine
months
of
office
harry
vane
saw
that
where
he
had
meant
to
create
fair
order
his
hand
created
only
disorder
and
utterly
disheartened
he
begged
the
council
to
relieve
him
of
the
governorship
and
allow
him
to
go
home
to
england
but
when
one
of
his
friends
stood
up
and
spoke
in
moving
terms
of
the
great
loss
he
would
be
harry
vane
burst
into
tears
and
declared
he
would
stay
only
he
could
not
bear
all
the
squabbling
that
had
been
going
on
nor
to
hear
it
constantly
said
that
he
was
the
cause
of
it
then
when
the
council
declared
that
if
that
was
the
only
reason
he
had
for
going
they
could
not
give
him
leave
he
repented
of
what
he
had
said
and
declared
he
must
go
for
reasons
of
private
business
and
that
anything
else
he
had
said
was
only
said
in
temper
whereupon
the
court
consented
in
silence
to
his
going
all
this
was
not
very
dignified
for
the
governor
of
a
state
but
hardly
surprising
from
a
passionate
youth
who
had
undertaken
a
task
too
difficult
for
him
and
felt
himself
a
failure
however
vane
did
not
go
he
stayed
on
to
the
end
of
his
time
and
even
sought
to
be
but
feeling
against
him
was
by
this
time
far
too
keen
he
was
rejected
as
governor
and
not
even
chosen
as
one
of
the
council
this
hurt
him
deeply
he
sulked
in
a
somewhat
undignified
manner
and
at
length
in
august
sailed
home
never
to
return
he
had
flashed
like
a
brilliant
meteor
across
the
dull
life
of
the
colony
he
made
strife
at
the
time
but
afterwards
there
was
no
bitterness
when
the
colonists
were
in
difficulties
they
were
ever
ready
to
ask
help
from
harry
vane
and
he
as
readily
gave
it
even
his
enemies
had
to
acknowledge
his
uprightness
and
generosity
at
all
times
wrote
his
adversary
winthrop
he
showed
himself
a
true
friend
to
new
england
and
a
man
of
noble
and
generous
mind
he
took
a
great
part
in
the
troublous
times
which
now
came
upon
england
and
more
than
twenty
years
later
he
died
bravely
on
the
scaffold
for
the
cause
to
which
he
had
given
his
life
chapter
the
story
of
anne
hutchinson
and
the
founding
of
rhode
island
about
a
year
before
harry
vane
came
to
massachusetts
another
interesting
and
brilliant
colonist
arrived
this
was
a
woman
named
anne
hutchinson
she
was
clever
a
woman
of
a
ready
wit
and
bold
spirit
like
williams
she
was
in
advance
of
her
times
and
like
him
she
soon
became
a
religious
leader
she
was
able
she
was
deeply
interested
in
religion
and
she
saw
no
reason
why
women
should
not
speak
their
minds
on
such
matters
men
used
to
hold
meetings
to
discuss
questions
of
religion
and
politics
to
which
women
were
not
allowed
to
go
anne
hutchinson
thought
this
was
insulting
and
she
began
to
hold
meetings
for
women
in
her
own
home
these
meetings
became
so
popular
that
often
as
many
as
a
hundred
women
would
be
present
they
discussed
matters
of
religion
and
as
hutchinson
held
dangerous
errors
about
grace
and
works
and
justification
and
sanctification
this
set
the
whole
colony
agog
by
the
time
that
harry
vane
was
chosen
governor
the
matter
had
become
serious
all
the
colony
took
sides
for
or
against
harry
vane
who
stood
for
toleration
and
freedom
sided
with
hutchinson
while
winthrop
his
great
rival
sided
against
her
hutchinson
was
supported
and
encouraged
in
her
wickedness
by
her
john
wheelright
a
silenced
minister
sometimes
in
england
she
also
led
away
many
other
godly
hearts
the
quarrel
affected
the
whole
colony
and
was
a
in
the
way
of
all
progress
but
so
long
as
harry
vane
was
governor
hutchinson
continued
her
preaching
and
teaching
when
he
sailed
home
however
and
winthrop
was
governor
once
more
the
elders
of
the
community
decided
that
hutchinson
was
a
danger
to
the
colony
and
must
be
silenced
so
all
the
elders
and
leaders
met
together
in
assembly
and
condemned
her
opinions
some
as
being
blasphemous
some
erroneous
and
all
unsafe
a
few
women
they
decided
might
without
serious
wrong
meet
together
to
pray
and
edify
one
another
but
that
a
large
number
of
sixty
or
more
should
do
so
every
week
was
agreed
to
be
disorderly
and
without
rule
and
as
hutchinson
would
not
cease
her
preaching
and
teaching
but
obstinately
continued
in
her
gross
errors
she
was
excommunicated
and
exiled
from
the
colony
like
williams
hutchinson
went
to
rhode
island
to
the
sorrow
of
the
godly
her
husband
went
with
her
and
when
they
tried
to
bring
him
back
he
refused
for
he
said
i
am
more
dearly
tied
to
my
wife
than
to
the
church
and
i
do
think
her
a
dear
saint
and
servant
of
god
in
rhode
island
hutchinson
and
her
friends
founded
the
towns
of
portsmouth
and
newport
others
who
had
been
driven
out
of
one
colony
or
another
followed
them
and
other
towns
were
founded
and
for
a
time
rhode
island
seems
to
have
been
a
sort
of
land
and
the
most
unruly
of
all
the
new
england
colonies
at
length
however
all
these
little
settlements
joined
together
under
one
governor
at
first
the
colony
had
no
charter
and
occupied
the
land
only
by
right
of
agreement
with
the
indians
but
after
some
time
roger
williams
got
a
charter
from
charles
ii
in
this
charter
it
was
set
down
that
no
one
should
be
persecuted
for
any
difference
in
opinion
on
matters
of
religion
thus
another
new
state
was
founded
and
in
rhode
island
there
was
more
real
freedom
than
in
almost
any
other
colony
in
new
england
massachusetts
was
at
this
time
as
we
can
see
not
exactly
an
easy
place
to
live
in
for
any
one
whose
opinions
differed
in
the
slightest
from
those
laid
down
by
law
those
same
people
who
had
left
their
homes
to
seek
freedom
of
conscience
denied
it
to
others
but
they
were
so
very
very
sure
that
their
way
was
the
only
right
way
that
they
could
not
understand
how
any
one
could
think
otherwise
they
were
good
and
honest
men
and
if
they
were
severe
with
their
fellows
who
strayed
from
the
narrow
path
it
was
only
in
the
hope
that
by
punishing
them
in
this
life
they
might
save
them
from
much
more
terrible
punishment
in
the
life
to
come
chapter
the
founding
of
harvard
one
very
good
thing
we
have
to
remember
about
the
first
settlers
of
massachusetts
is
that
early
in
the
life
of
the
colony
they
founded
schools
and
colleges
a
good
many
of
the
settlers
were
oxford
and
cambridge
men
though
more
indeed
came
from
cambridge
than
from
oxford
as
cambridge
was
much
the
more
puritan
of
the
two
but
whether
from
oxford
or
from
cambridge
they
were
eager
that
their
children
born
in
this
new
england
should
have
as
good
an
education
as
their
fathers
had
had
in
old
england
so
when
harry
vane
was
governor
the
colonists
voted
with
which
to
build
a
school
this
is
the
first
time
known
to
history
that
the
people
themselves
voted
their
own
money
to
found
a
school
it
was
decided
to
build
the
school
at
newtown
but
the
cambridge
men
did
not
like
the
name
so
they
got
it
changed
to
cambridge
to
tell
their
posterity
whence
they
came
shortly
before
this
a
young
cambridge
man
named
john
harvard
had
come
out
to
massachusetts
very
little
is
known
of
him
save
that
he
came
of
simple
folk
and
was
good
and
learned
a
godly
gentleman
and
lover
of
learning
old
writers
call
him
a
scholar
and
pious
in
his
life
and
enlarged
towards
the
country
and
the
good
of
it
in
life
and
in
death
soon
after
he
came
to
boston
this
godly
gentleman
was
made
minister
of
the
church
at
charlestown
but
he
was
very
delicate
and
in
a
few
months
he
died
as
a
scholar
and
a
cambridge
man
he
had
been
greatly
interested
in
the
building
of
the
college
at
cambridge
so
when
he
died
he
left
half
his
money
and
all
his
books
to
it
the
settlers
were
very
grateful
for
this
bequest
and
to
show
their
gratitude
they
decided
to
name
the
college
after
john
harvard
thus
the
first
university
in
america
was
founded
from
the
beginning
the
college
was
a
pleasant
place
more
like
a
bowling
green
than
a
wilderness
said
one
man
the
buildings
were
thought
by
some
to
be
too
gorgeous
for
a
wilderness
and
yet
too
mean
in
apprehensions
for
a
the
edifice
says
another
is
very
faire
and
comely
within
and
without
having
in
it
a
spacious
hall
and
a
large
library
with
some
bookes
to
it
of
harvard
own
books
there
were
nearly
three
hundred
a
very
good
beginning
for
a
library
in
those
days
but
unfortunately
they
were
all
burnt
about
a
hundred
years
later
when
the
library
accidentally
took
fire
only
one
book
was
saved
as
it
was
not
in
the
library
at
the
time
harvard
books
are
gone
nor
does
anything
now
remain
of
the
first
buildings
so
faire
and
comely
within
and
without
but
the
memory
of
the
old
founders
and
their
wonderful
purpose
and
energy
is
still
kept
green
and
over
the
chief
entrance
of
the
present
buildings
are
carved
some
words
taken
from
a
writer
of
those
times
after
god
had
carried
us
safe
to
new
england
and
we
had
builded
our
houses
provided
necessaries
for
our
livelihood
rear
convenient
places
for
god
worship
and
settled
the
civil
government
one
of
the
next
things
we
longed
for
and
looked
after
was
to
advance
learning
and
perpetuate
it
to
posterity
dreading
to
leave
an
illiterate
ministry
to
the
churches
when
our
present
ministers
shall
be
in
the
dust
john
harvard
was
a
good
and
simple
man
in
giving
his
money
to
found
a
college
he
had
no
thought
of
making
himself
famous
but
he
builded
better
than
he
knew
for
he
reared
for
himself
an
eternal
monument
and
made
his
name
famous
to
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
when
kings
and
emperors
are
forgotten
the
name
of
harvard
will
be
remembered
chapter
how
quakers
first
came
to
new
england
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
a
new
kind
of
religion
arose
this
was
the
religion
of
the
quakers
george
fox
was
the
founder
of
this
sect
and
they
called
themselves
the
friends
of
truth
the
name
quaker
was
given
to
them
by
their
enemies
in
derision
because
they
trembled
before
the
lord
the
quakers
were
a
people
they
tried
to
be
kind
and
charitable
they
refused
to
go
to
law
and
they
refused
to
fight
they
also
gave
up
using
titles
of
all
kinds
for
my
lord
peter
and
my
lord
paul
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
bible
they
refused
to
take
off
their
hats
to
any
man
believing
that
that
was
a
sign
of
worship
which
belonged
to
god
only
they
refused
also
to
take
oath
of
any
kind
even
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
king
because
christ
had
said
swear
not
at
all
they
used
thee
and
thou
instead
of
you
in
speaking
to
a
single
person
because
they
thought
it
more
simple
and
truthful
and
they
refused
to
say
goodnight
or
goodmorrow
for
they
knew
night
was
good
and
day
was
good
without
wishing
either
there
was
a
great
deal
that
was
good
in
their
religion
and
very
little
it
would
seem
that
was
harmful
but
they
were
pronounced
to
be
mischievous
and
dangerous
people
men
did
not
understand
the
quakers
and
as
often
happens
when
men
do
not
understand
they
became
afraid
of
them
because
they
wore
black
clothes
and
hats
they
thought
they
must
be
jesuits
in
disguise
so
ignorance
bred
fear
and
fear
brought
forth
persecution
and
on
all
sides
the
quakers
were
hunted
and
reviled
they
were
fined
and
imprisoned
scourged
and
exiled
and
sold
into
slavery
then
like
other
persecuted
people
they
sought
a
refuge
in
new
england
across
the
seas
but
the
people
there
were
just
as
ignorant
as
the
people
at
home
and
the
quakers
found
no
kindly
welcome
the
first
quakers
to
arrive
in
new
england
were
two
women
but
before
they
were
allowed
to
land
officers
were
sent
on
board
the
ship
to
search
their
boxes
they
found
a
great
many
books
which
they
carried
ashore
and
while
the
women
were
kept
prisoner
on
board
the
ship
the
books
were
burned
in
the
market
place
by
the
common
hangman
then
the
women
were
brought
ashore
and
sent
to
prison
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
were
quakers
no
one
was
allowed
to
speak
to
them
on
pain
of
a
fine
of
and
lest
any
should
attempt
it
even
the
windows
of
the
prison
were
boarded
up
they
were
allowed
no
candle
and
their
pens
ink
and
paper
were
taken
from
them
they
might
have
starved
but
that
one
good
old
man
named
nicholas
upshal
whose
heart
was
grieved
for
them
paid
the
gaoler
to
give
them
food
thus
they
were
kept
until
a
ship
was
ready
to
sail
for
england
then
they
were
put
on
board
and
the
captain
was
made
to
swear
that
he
would
put
them
ashore
nowhere
but
in
england
such
says
an
old
writer
was
the
entertainment
the
quakers
first
met
with
at
boston
and
that
from
a
people
who
pretended
that
for
conscience
sake
they
had
chosen
the
wilderness
of
america
before
the
old
england
the
next
quakers
who
arrived
were
treated
much
in
the
same
fashion
and
sent
back
to
england
and
a
law
was
made
forbidding
quakers
to
come
to
the
colony
at
this
time
the
same
good
old
man
who
had
already
befriended
them
was
grieved
take
heed
he
said
that
you
be
not
found
fighting
against
god
and
so
draw
down
a
judgment
upon
the
land
but
the
men
of
boston
were
seized
with
a
frenzy
of
hate
and
fear
and
they
banished
this
old
man
because
he
had
dared
to
speak
kindly
of
the
accursed
sect
it
is
true
the
men
of
new
england
had
some
excuse
for
trying
to
keep
the
quakers
out
of
their
colony
for
some
of
them
were
foolish
and
tried
to
force
their
opinions
noisily
upon
others
they
interrupted
the
church
services
mocked
the
magistrates
and
the
clergy
and
some
carried
away
by
religious
fervour
behaved
more
like
mad
folk
than
the
disciples
of
a
religion
of
love
and
charity
yet
in
spite
of
the
law
forbidding
them
to
come
quakers
kept
on
coming
to
the
colony
and
all
who
came
were
imprisoned
beaten
and
then
thrust
forth
with
orders
never
to
return
but
still
they
came
so
a
law
was
made
that
any
quaker
coming
into
the
colony
should
have
one
of
his
ears
cut
off
if
he
came
again
he
should
have
a
second
ear
cut
off
if
he
came
a
third
time
he
should
have
his
tongue
bored
through
with
a
hot
iron
but
even
this
cruel
law
had
no
effect
upon
the
quakers
they
heeded
it
not
and
came
in
as
great
or
even
greater
numbers
than
before
the
people
of
boston
were
in
despair
they
had
no
wise
to
be
cruel
indeed
many
hated
and
were
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
cruel
laws
made
against
these
strange
people
but
they
were
nevertheless
determined
that
quakers
should
not
come
into
their
land
so
now
they
made
a
law
that
any
quaker
who
came
to
the
colony
and
refused
to
go
away
again
when
ordered
should
be
hanged
this
they
thought
would
certainly
keep
these
pernicious
folk
away
but
it
did
not
for
the
quakers
were
determined
to
prove
to
all
the
world
that
they
were
free
to
go
where
they
would
and
that
if
they
chose
to
come
to
boston
no
laws
should
keep
them
out
so
they
kept
on
coming
the
magistrates
knew
not
what
to
do
they
had
never
meant
to
hang
any
of
them
but
only
to
frighten
them
away
but
having
made
the
law
they
were
determined
to
fulfil
it
and
five
quakers
were
hanged
one
of
them
a
woman
but
while
the
fifth
was
being
tried
another
quaker
named
christison
who
had
already
been
banished
calmly
walked
into
the
court
when
they
saw
him
the
magistrates
were
struck
dumb
for
they
saw
that
against
determination
like
this
no
punishment
however
severe
might
avail
on
their
ears
christison
words
fell
heavily
i
am
come
here
to
warn
you
he
cried
that
you
should
shed
no
more
innocent
blood
for
the
blood
that
you
have
shed
already
cries
to
the
lord
god
for
vengeance
to
come
upon
you
nevertheless
he
too
was
seized
and
tried
but
he
defended
himself
well
by
what
law
will
you
put
me
to
death
he
asked
we
have
a
law
replied
the
magistrates
and
by
our
law
you
are
to
die
so
said
the
jews
to
christ
replied
christison
have
a
law
and
by
our
law
you
ought
to
die
who
empowered
you
to
make
that
law
how
have
you
power
to
make
laws
different
from
the
laws
of
england
no
said
the
governor
then
said
christison
you
are
gone
beyond
your
bounds
are
you
subjects
to
the
king
yea
or
nay
yea
we
are
so
well
said
christison
so
am
i
therefore
seeing
that
you
and
i
are
subjects
to
the
king
i
demand
to
be
tried
by
the
laws
of
my
own
nation
for
i
never
heard
nor
read
of
any
law
that
was
in
england
to
hang
quakers
yet
in
spite
of
his
brave
defence
christison
was
condemned
to
death
but
the
sentence
was
never
carried
out
for
the
people
had
grown
weary
of
these
cruelties
even
the
magistrates
who
for
a
time
had
been
carried
away
by
blind
hate
saw
that
they
were
wrong
christison
and
many
of
his
friends
who
had
lain
in
prison
awaiting
trial
were
set
free
the
quakers
too
now
found
a
strange
friend
in
king
charles
for
the
doings
of
the
new
englanders
in
this
matter
reached
even
his
careless
ears
and
he
wrote
to
his
trusty
and
subjects
bidding
them
cease
their
persecutions
and
send
the
quakers
back
to
england
to
be
tried
this
the
people
of
massachusetts
never
did
but
henceforth
the
persecutions
died
down
and
although
from
time
to
time
the
quakers
were
still
beaten
and
imprisoned
no
more
were
put
to
death
at
length
the
persecution
died
away
altogether
and
the
quakers
allowed
to
live
in
peace
became
quiet
citizens
chapter
how
maine
and
new
hampshire
were
founded
north
of
massachusetts
two
more
colonies
new
hampshire
and
maine
were
founded
but
they
were
not
founded
by
men
who
fled
from
tyranny
but
by
statesmen
and
traders
who
realised
the
worth
of
america
not
by
puritans
but
by
churchmen
and
royalists
the
two
men
who
were
chiefly
concerned
in
the
founding
of
these
colonies
were
sir
ferdinando
gorges
and
captain
john
mason
they
were
both
eager
colonists
and
they
both
got
several
charters
and
patents
from
the
king
and
from
the
new
england
company
it
would
be
too
confusing
to
follow
all
these
grants
and
charters
or
all
the
attempts
at
settlements
made
by
mason
and
gorges
and
others
the
land
granted
to
them
was
often
very
vaguely
outlined
the
fact
being
that
the
people
who
applied
for
the
land
and
those
who
drew
up
the
charters
had
only
the
vaguest
ideas
concerning
the
land
in
question
so
the
grants
often
overlapped
each
other
and
the
same
land
was
frequently
claimed
by
two
people
and
of
course
confusion
and
quarrels
followed
in
mason
and
gorges
being
friends
agreed
to
divide
the
province
of
maine
between
them
and
mason
called
his
part
new
hampshire
after
the
county
of
hampshire
in
england
of
which
he
was
fond
mason
and
gorges
each
now
had
an
enormous
tract
of
land
but
they
wanted
still
more
the
french
as
you
know
had
already
made
settlements
in
canada
but
just
at
this
time
that
buccaneering
sea
captain
david
kirke
besieged
quebec
took
it
and
carried
its
brave
governor
champlain
away
prisoner
now
as
soon
as
they
heard
of
this
gorges
and
mason
asked
the
king
to
give
them
a
grant
of
part
of
the
conquered
land
for
it
was
known
to
be
a
fine
country
for
fur
trade
and
was
also
believed
to
be
rich
in
gold
and
silver
mines
in
answer
to
this
petition
the
king
granted
a
great
tract
of
land
to
gorges
and
mason
this
they
called
laconia
because
it
was
supposed
to
contain
many
lakes
they
never
did
much
with
it
however
and
in
a
few
years
when
peace
was
made
with
france
it
had
all
to
be
given
back
to
the
french
both
mason
and
gorges
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
trying
to
encourage
colonists
to
settle
on
their
land
and
the
people
of
massachusetts
were
not
at
all
pleased
to
have
such
powerful
churchmen
for
their
neighbours
as
has
been
said
land
grants
often
overlapped
and
part
of
the
land
granted
to
gorges
and
mason
was
also
claimed
by
massachusetts
the
massachusetts
colonists
insisted
on
their
rights
both
gorges
and
mason
therefore
became
their
enemies
and
did
their
best
to
have
their
charter
taken
away
to
this
end
gorges
got
himself
made
governor
general
of
the
whole
of
new
england
with
power
to
do
almost
as
he
liked
and
he
made
ready
to
set
out
for
his
new
domain
with
a
thousand
soldiers
to
enforce
his
authority
when
this
news
reached
massachusetts
the
whole
colony
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
excitement
for
in
this
appointment
the
settlers
saw
the
end
of
freedom
the
beginning
of
tyranny
both
gorges
and
his
friend
mason
were
zealous
churchmen
and
the
puritans
felt
sure
would
try
to
force
them
all
to
become
churchmen
also
this
the
settlers
determined
to
resist
with
all
their
might
so
they
built
forts
round
boston
harbour
and
mounted
cannon
ready
to
sink
any
hostile
vessel
which
might
put
into
port
in
every
village
the
young
men
trained
as
soldiers
and
a
beacon
was
set
up
on
the
highest
point
of
the
triple
hill
upon
which
boston
is
built
and
daily
these
young
men
turned
their
eyes
to
the
hill
for
when
a
light
appeared
there
they
knew
it
would
be
time
to
put
on
their
steel
caps
and
corslets
and
march
to
defend
their
liberties
ever
since
the
hill
has
been
called
beacon
hill
but
the
danger
passed
the
new
ship
which
was
being
built
for
ferdinando
gorges
mysteriously
fell
to
pieces
on
the
very
launching
of
it
and
captain
mason
died
he
was
the
chief
mover
in
all
the
attempts
against
us
says
winthrop
but
the
lord
in
his
mercy
taking
him
away
all
the
business
fell
on
sleep
but
still
gorges
did
not
give
up
his
plans
he
did
not
now
go
out
to
new
england
himself
as
he
had
meant
to
do
but
sent
first
his
nephew
and
then
his
cousin
instead
they
however
did
not
trouble
massachusetts
much
over
the
province
of
maine
sir
ferdinando
ruled
supreme
he
could
raise
troops
make
war
give
people
titles
levy
taxes
no
one
might
settle
down
or
trade
in
his
province
without
his
permission
and
all
must
look
upon
him
as
the
lord
of
the
soil
and
pay
him
tribute
it
was
the
feudal
system
come
again
and
sir
ferdinando
gorges
was
as
near
being
a
king
as
any
ruler
of
america
ever
has
been
he
drew
up
a
most
elaborate
constitution
too
for
his
kingdom
making
almost
more
offices
than
there
were
citizens
to
fill
them
for
after
all
his
kingdom
was
a
mere
wilderness
containing
two
fishing
villages
and
here
and
there
a
few
scattered
settlements
and
when
the
deputy
governor
arrived
to
rule
this
kingdom
he
found
his
palace
merely
a
store
house
with
nothing
of
household
stuff
remaining
but
an
old
pot
a
pair
of
tongs
and
a
couple
of
irons
thus
side
by
side
with
the
puritan
colonies
of
new
england
colonies
which
were
almost
republics
there
was
planted
a
feudal
state
which
was
almost
a
monarchy
of
all
the
new
england
colonies
new
hampshire
and
maine
were
the
only
two
which
were
not
founded
for
the
sake
of
religion
for
although
the
english
church
was
established
in
both
as
the
state
religion
that
was
merely
because
the
proprietors
were
of
that
church
the
colonies
were
founded
for
the
sake
of
trade
and
profit
but
they
grew
very
slowly
in
sir
ferdinando
gorges
died
and
maine
was
left
much
to
itself
for
his
son
john
took
little
interest
in
his
father
great
estate
thirty
years
later
his
grandson
another
ferdinando
sold
his
rights
to
massachusetts
from
that
time
till
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
separate
state
maine
was
a
part
of
massachusetts
neither
did
the
heirs
of
mason
pay
much
attention
to
their
estates
at
first
and
when
they
did
there
was
a
good
deal
of
quarrelling
and
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
at
length
they
sold
their
rights
to
twelve
men
who
were
afterwards
known
as
the
masonian
proprietors
there
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
too
before
new
hampshire
was
finally
recognised
as
a
separate
colony
it
was
joined
to
massachusetts
and
separated
again
more
than
once
but
at
last
after
many
changes
new
hampshire
finally
became
a
recognised
separate
colony
and
although
captain
john
mason
died
long
before
this
happened
he
has
been
called
the
founder
of
new
hampshire
if
the
highest
moral
honour
it
has
been
said
belongs
to
founders
of
states
as
bacon
has
declared
then
mason
deserved
it
to
seize
on
a
tract
of
the
american
wilderness
to
define
its
limits
to
give
it
a
name
to
plant
it
with
an
english
colony
and
to
die
giving
it
his
last
thoughts
among
worldly
concerns
are
acts
as
lofty
and
noble
as
any
recorded
in
the
history
of
colonisation
chapter
the
founding
of
connecticut
and
war
with
the
indians
many
of
the
people
who
founded
massachusetts
colony
were
people
people
of
good
family
aristocrats
in
fact
they
were
men
accustomed
to
rule
accustomed
to
unquestioning
obedience
from
their
servants
and
those
under
them
they
believed
that
the
few
were
meant
to
rule
and
the
many
meant
to
obey
the
idea
that
every
person
should
have
a
share
in
the
government
never
entered
their
heads
their
governor
winthrop
was
an
aristocrat
to
the
backbone
he
believed
heartily
in
the
government
of
the
many
by
the
few
and
made
it
as
difficult
as
possible
for
citizens
to
obtain
the
right
of
voting
but
there
were
many
people
who
were
discontented
with
this
aristocratic
rule
among
them
was
a
minister
named
thomas
hooker
like
john
harvard
a
graduate
of
emmanuel
college
cambridge
so
being
dissatisfied
he
and
his
congregation
decided
to
move
away
and
found
a
new
colony
they
were
the
more
ready
to
do
this
as
the
land
round
boston
was
not
fertile
and
so
many
new
settlers
had
come
and
their
cattle
and
flocks
had
increased
so
rapidly
that
it
was
already
difficult
to
find
food
and
fodder
for
man
and
beast
adventurers
who
had
traveled
far
afield
had
brought
back
glowing
reports
of
the
beauty
and
fertility
of
the
connecticut
valley
and
there
hooker
decided
to
settle
but
for
several
reasons
many
of
the
people
of
massachusetts
objected
to
his
going
he
and
his
people
they
said
would
be
in
danger
from
the
dutch
who
already
had
a
settlement
there
and
who
claimed
the
whole
valley
they
would
also
be
in
danger
from
the
indians
who
were
known
to
be
hostile
and
lastly
they
would
be
in
danger
from
the
british
government
because
they
had
no
charter
permitting
them
to
settle
in
this
land
the
people
at
home
they
said
would
not
endure
they
should
sit
down
without
a
patent
on
any
place
which
our
king
lays
claim
unto
the
people
of
massachusetts
were
keeping
quiet
and
going
along
steadily
in
their
own
way
without
paying
any
heed
to
the
british
government
they
wanted
to
be
left
alone
and
they
did
not
want
any
one
else
to
do
things
which
might
call
attention
to
them
and
besides
all
this
they
were
greatly
troubled
at
the
thought
of
losing
an
eloquent
preacher
like
hooker
every
church
was
like
a
candlestick
giving
light
to
the
world
and
the
removing
of
a
candlestick
they
said
is
a
great
judgment
which
is
to
be
avoided
but
in
spite
of
all
arguments
hooker
determined
to
go
so
one
june
morning
he
and
his
congregation
set
forth
they
sent
their
furniture
by
water
and
they
themselves
both
men
and
women
started
to
walk
the
hundred
miles
driving
their
cattle
before
them
only
hooker
who
was
ill
being
carried
in
a
litter
they
went
slowly
allowing
the
cattle
to
graze
by
the
wayside
living
chiefly
on
the
milk
of
the
cows
and
the
wild
fruits
they
found
it
was
no
easy
journey
for
their
way
led
through
the
pathless
wilderness
their
only
guides
being
the
compass
and
the
sun
for
in
those
days
we
must
remember
that
beyond
the
settlements
the
whole
of
america
was
untrodden
ground
save
the
indian
trails
there
were
no
roads
here
they
had
to
fell
trees
and
make
a
rough
bridge
to
cross
a
stream
there
they
hewed
their
way
through
bushy
undergrowth
again
they
climbed
steep
hillsides
or
picked
their
way
painfully
through
swamps
suffering
many
discomforts
and
fatigues
but
there
were
delights
too
for
the
sky
was
blue
above
them
birds
sang
to
them
night
and
morning
and
wild
flowers
starred
the
ground
and
scented
the
air
all
day
they
marched
beneath
the
sunny
blue
sky
every
evening
they
lit
their
as
a
protection
against
wild
beasts
and
lay
down
to
rest
beneath
the
stars
for
they
had
no
cover
but
the
heavens
nor
any
lodgings
but
those
which
simple
nature
afforded
them
for
a
fortnight
they
journeyed
thus
through
the
wilderness
then
they
reached
the
connecticut
river
and
their
journey
end
and
here
they
built
a
little
town
which
they
called
hartford
other
communities
followed
the
example
of
hooker
and
his
flock
and
wethersfield
and
windsor
were
built
at
first
all
these
towns
remained
a
part
of
massachusetts
in
name
at
least
but
after
a
time
the
settlers
met
together
at
hartford
and
agreeing
to
form
a
little
republic
of
their
own
they
drew
up
a
set
of
rules
for
themselves
the
chief
difference
from
those
of
massachusetts
being
that
the
religious
tests
were
done
away
with
and
a
man
need
no
longer
be
a
member
of
a
church
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
vote
it
is
also
interesting
to
remember
that
in
these
fundamental
orders
as
they
called
their
constitution
there
is
no
mention
of
the
british
king
or
government
these
colonists
had
settled
new
land
without
a
charter
and
they
made
laws
without
recognising
any
authority
but
their
own
thus
the
colony
of
connecticut
was
founded
besides
these
towns
john
winthrop
the
son
of
the
governor
of
massachusetts
founded
a
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
connecticut
river
for
he
saw
it
was
a
good
place
for
trade
with
the
indians
this
fort
was
called
sayebrook
after
lord
saye
and
sele
and
lord
brook
two
puritan
lords
who
had
obtained
a
grant
of
land
along
the
connecticut
river
but
this
new
colony
was
very
nearly
wiped
out
as
soon
as
begun
for
one
of
the
dangers
which
the
people
of
massachusetts
foretold
proved
a
very
real
one
this
was
the
danger
from
the
indians
the
indians
are
divided
into
several
families
such
as
the
algonquins
the
hurons
the
iroquois
each
of
these
families
again
containing
many
tribes
all
the
indians
in
new
england
belonged
to
the
algonquin
family
but
were
of
course
divided
into
many
tribes
one
of
these
tribes
was
called
the
pequots
they
were
very
powerful
and
they
tyrannised
over
the
other
tribes
round
about
they
hated
the
white
men
and
whenever
they
had
the
opportunity
they
slew
them
the
new
colony
of
connecticut
was
far
nearer
their
than
massachusetts
it
was
a
far
easier
prey
and
from
the
very
beginning
the
pequots
harassed
the
settlers
they
made
no
open
attack
but
skulked
about
murdering
men
and
women
now
here
now
there
appearing
suddenly
and
vanishing
again
as
swiftly
this
sort
of
thing
could
not
be
endured
and
the
english
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
it
so
messengers
were
sent
to
the
indians
to
demand
that
the
murderers
should
be
given
up
to
the
english
when
the
indians
saw
the
english
boats
appear
they
did
not
seem
in
the
least
afraid
but
came
running
along
the
shouting
what
cheer
englishmen
what
cheer
what
do
you
come
for
but
the
englishmen
would
not
answer
and
the
pequots
never
thinking
that
the
englishmen
meant
war
kept
running
on
beside
the
boats
as
they
sailed
up
the
river
what
cheer
englishmen
what
cheer
they
kept
repeating
are
you
angry
will
you
kill
us
do
you
come
to
fight
but
still
the
englishmen
would
not
answer
then
the
indians
began
to
be
afraid
and
that
night
they
built
great
fires
on
either
side
of
the
river
fearing
lest
the
englishmen
might
land
in
the
darkness
all
night
long
too
they
kept
up
a
most
doleful
howling
calling
to
each
other
and
passing
the
word
on
from
place
to
place
to
gather
the
braves
together
next
morning
early
they
sent
an
ambassador
to
the
english
captain
he
was
a
big
man
very
grave
and
majestic
why
do
you
come
here
he
asked
i
have
come
answered
the
captain
to
demand
the
heads
of
those
who
have
slain
our
comrades
it
is
not
the
habit
of
the
english
to
suffer
murderers
to
live
so
if
you
desire
peace
and
welfare
give
us
the
heads
of
the
murderers
we
knew
not
answered
the
wily
indian
that
any
of
our
braves
had
slain
any
of
yours
it
is
true
we
have
slain
some
white
men
but
we
took
them
to
be
dutch
it
is
hard
for
us
to
know
the
difference
between
dutch
and
english
you
know
the
difference
between
dutch
and
english
quite
well
answered
the
captain
sternly
and
therefore
seeing
you
have
slain
the
king
of
england
subjects
we
come
to
demand
vengeance
for
their
blood
we
knew
no
difference
between
the
dutch
and
english
declared
the
indian
they
are
both
strangers
to
us
and
we
took
them
to
be
all
one
therefore
we
crave
pardon
we
have
not
wilfully
wronged
the
english
that
excuse
will
not
do
insisted
the
captain
we
have
proof
that
you
know
the
english
from
the
dutch
we
must
have
the
heads
of
those
persons
who
have
slain
our
men
or
else
we
will
fight
you
then
seeing
that
he
could
not
move
the
english
captain
from
his
determination
the
ambassador
asked
leave
to
go
back
to
his
chief
promising
to
return
speedily
with
his
answer
he
was
allowed
to
go
but
as
he
did
not
return
very
soon
the
englishmen
followed
seeing
this
the
ambassador
hurried
to
them
begging
them
not
to
come
nearer
and
saying
that
his
chief
could
not
be
found
as
he
had
gone
to
long
island
that
is
not
true
replied
the
english
we
know
he
is
here
so
find
him
speedily
or
we
will
march
through
the
country
and
spoil
your
corn
hour
after
hour
went
past
the
englishmen
always
patiently
waiting
the
wily
indian
always
inventing
some
new
excuse
for
delay
but
at
length
the
patience
of
the
english
was
exhausted
and
beating
their
drums
they
charged
the
savages
some
were
killed
and
the
rest
fleeing
the
english
burned
their
wigwams
and
destroyed
their
corn
and
carried
off
their
mats
and
baskets
as
booty
but
the
pequots
were
not
in
the
least
subdued
and
more
than
ever
they
harassed
the
colonists
of
connecticut
so
the
men
of
connecticut
sent
to
massachusetts
and
to
plymouth
asking
for
help
the
people
of
plymouth
however
said
the
quarrel
was
none
of
theirs
and
sent
no
help
but
from
massachusetts
about
twenty
men
were
sent
besides
this
a
few
friendly
indians
glad
at
the
chance
of
punishing
their
old
tyrants
joined
with
the
white
men
so
one
moonlight
night
the
little
company
embarked
and
sailing
along
the
coast
landed
at
a
spot
about
two
days
journey
from
the
pequot
fort
as
they
got
near
to
it
most
of
the
indians
who
had
come
with
the
english
took
fright
and
ran
away
so
less
than
a
hundred
englishmen
were
left
to
attack
seven
hundred
indians
a
little
before
dawn
they
reached
the
fort
the
indians
were
all
sleeping
and
keeping
no
guard
so
the
englishmen
quietly
took
possession
of
both
entrances
to
the
fort
then
suddenly
through
the
still
morning
air
the
sharp
sound
of
a
volley
of
musketry
rang
out
as
though
the
finger
of
god
had
touched
both
match
and
flint
affrighted
the
indians
sprang
from
their
sleep
yelling
in
terror
they
scarce
had
time
to
seize
their
bows
and
arrows
when
sword
in
hand
the
englishmen
stormed
into
the
fort
a
fierce
fight
followed
showers
of
arrows
fell
upon
the
englishmen
but
they
did
little
hurt
and
glanced
off
for
the
most
part
harmless
from
their
thick
buff
coats
and
steel
corslets
during
the
fight
some
of
the
huts
were
set
on
fire
and
soon
the
whole
village
was
a
roaring
mass
of
flames
many
perished
miserably
in
the
fire
others
who
fled
from
it
were
cut
down
by
the
englishmen
or
escaping
them
fell
into
the
hands
of
their
own
countrymen
they
found
no
mercy
for
they
had
given
none
and
remembering
the
awful
tortures
which
their
had
suffered
the
englishmen
had
no
compassion
on
their
murderers
ere
an
hour
had
passed
the
fight
was
over
out
of
four
hundred
indians
not
more
than
five
escaped
the
pequots
were
utterly
wiped
out
and
their
village
a
heap
of
smoking
ruins
never
before
had
such
terrible
vengeance
overtaken
any
indian
tribe
and
all
the
other
tribes
were
so
frightened
and
amazed
that
for
forty
years
there
was
peace
in
new
england
for
no
redmen
dare
attack
these
terrible
conquerors
chapter
the
founding
of
new
haven
in
spite
of
the
menace
of
the
redmen
englishmen
continued
to
settle
in
the
land
they
claimed
even
while
the
pequot
war
was
going
on
a
new
colony
had
been
founded
still
further
south
upon
the
shores
of
new
england
this
colony
was
founded
by
a
minister
named
john
davenport
john
davenport
had
fled
from
persecution
in
england
and
followed
by
his
congregation
including
many
wealthy
people
had
sought
like
so
many
other
puritans
a
refuge
in
new
england
the
newcomers
however
would
not
join
the
other
puritans
but
decided
to
found
a
colony
all
to
themselves
which
should
be
ruled
only
by
laws
found
in
the
bible
they
called
their
settlement
new
haven
and
here
the
law
that
none
but
church
members
should
vote
was
very
strictly
enforced
each
of
the
towns
was
governed
by
seven
men
known
as
the
pillars
of
the
church
these
men
served
as
judges
but
no
juries
were
allowed
because
no
mention
of
them
is
found
in
the
bible
the
laws
were
very
strict
but
the
famous
pretended
blue
laws
of
new
haven
which
people
used
to
make
fun
of
never
existed
in
these
it
was
pretended
that
there
were
such
absurd
laws
as
no
one
shall
cook
make
beds
sweep
house
cut
hair
or
shave
on
the
sabbath
no
woman
shall
kiss
her
child
on
the
sabbath
or
fasting
day
no
one
shall
keep
christmas
make
minced
pies
dance
play
cards
or
play
on
any
instrument
of
music
except
the
drum
trumpet
or
some
of
the
old
puritan
laws
seem
to
us
indeed
quaint
enough
but
there
are
none
quite
so
absurd
as
these
they
were
invented
by
an
early
tourist
who
sought
to
make
fun
of
these
earnest
colonists
the
new
haven
colonists
like
those
of
connecticut
had
no
charter
from
the
king
of
england
they
settled
the
land
not
by
agreement
with
him
but
by
agreement
with
the
indians
davenport
and
his
followers
bought
the
land
upon
which
they
settled
from
the
indians
to
one
chief
they
gave
twelve
coats
of
english
trucking
cloth
twelve
alchemy
spoons
twelve
hatchets
twelve
hoes
two
dozen
of
knives
twelve
porringers
and
four
cases
of
french
knives
and
scissors
to
another
eleven
coats
of
trucking
cloth
and
one
coat
of
english
cloth
the
agreement
was
all
duly
and
properly
written
out
and
signed
by
the
chiefs
but
of
course
as
the
chiefs
could
not
write
they
made
their
marks
the
first
agreement
was
signed
not
only
by
the
chief
and
his
council
but
also
by
the
chief
sister
we
have
now
heard
of
seven
new
england
colonies
being
founded
but
later
on
as
we
shall
see
plymouth
joined
with
massachusetts
and
new
haven
with
connecticut
thus
making
only
five
new
england
colonies
as
we
know
them
today
and
of
those
five
one
maine
was
not
recognised
as
a
separate
colony
but
as
part
of
massachusetts
after
it
remained
part
of
massachusetts
until
when
it
entered
the
union
as
a
state
meanwhile
massachusetts
new
hampshire
plymouth
connecticut
and
new
haven
all
joined
together
promising
to
help
each
other
in
case
of
war
with
the
indians
dutch
or
french
who
were
constant
dangers
to
them
all
alike
they
called
themselves
the
united
colonies
of
new
england
this
union
however
was
only
for
defence
each
colony
was
still
quite
independent
of
the
others
and
managed
its
own
affairs
as
before
it
was
only
the
first
shadow
of
the
great
union
which
was
to
come
many
years
later
it
was
also
one
more
proof
that
the
colonies
were
growing
up
and
thinking
for
themselves
for
they
asked
no
one
leave
to
form
this
union
they
thought
it
was
necessary
to
their
safety
so
they
entered
into
it
only
rhode
island
was
not
asked
to
join
there
was
still
too
much
bitterness
over
religious
matters
between
the
settlers
there
and
in
the
other
colonies
there
were
no
more
puritan
colonies
founded
for
puritans
ceased
now
to
come
to
new
england
in
large
numbers
the
reason
was
that
the
great
fight
between
king
and
people
between
cavalier
and
puritan
had
begun
in
old
england
and
when
the
puritans
won
and
could
have
their
own
way
at
home
they
were
no
longer
so
eager
to
set
forth
to
seek
a
new
england
beyond
the
seas
so
the
puritans
ceased
to
cross
the
seas
and
as
we
have
seen
in
their
place
many
cavaliers
came
to
virginia
chapter
the
hunt
for
the
regicides
the
commonwealth
of
england
did
not
last
long
in
king
charles
ii
was
restored
england
then
became
an
unsafe
abode
for
all
those
who
had
helped
to
condemn
charles
i
to
death
and
two
of
those
men
general
edward
whalley
and
william
goffe
fled
to
america
they
were
kindly
received
by
the
puritans
of
boston
and
after
a
time
they
moved
on
to
new
haven
but
even
in
america
they
were
not
safe
and
royalist
messengers
were
sent
from
england
to
arrest
them
and
take
them
home
to
be
tried
the
governor
of
massachusetts
pretended
to
be
very
eager
to
help
these
messengers
in
reality
he
did
nothing
to
help
but
hindered
them
rather
news
of
the
search
for
the
fugitives
soon
reached
new
haven
and
at
once
the
people
there
helped
them
to
hide
for
their
minister
john
davenport
had
bidden
them
to
hide
the
outcasts
and
betray
not
him
that
wandereth
goffe
and
whalley
knew
that
the
people
of
new
haven
would
not
betray
them
but
lest
their
enemies
should
gain
any
inkling
of
their
being
there
they
left
the
town
and
going
to
another
showed
themselves
openly
then
secretly
by
night
they
returned
to
new
haven
for
a
whole
month
they
lay
hid
there
in
the
cellars
of
the
house
but
soon
that
refuge
became
no
longer
safe
for
the
men
in
search
of
them
had
in
spite
of
their
strategy
traced
them
to
new
haven
and
set
out
to
arrest
them
one
saturday
the
royalists
reached
guilford
not
sixteen
miles
away
here
they
demanded
horses
from
the
governor
to
take
them
on
to
new
haven
but
the
governor
had
little
desire
to
help
them
so
with
one
excuse
after
another
he
put
them
off
until
it
was
too
late
to
start
that
night
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
it
was
strictly
against
the
laws
of
puritan
new
england
to
ride
or
drive
on
sunday
save
to
church
so
the
royalist
messengers
chafing
with
impatience
might
bribe
and
command
as
much
as
they
liked
not
a
man
would
stir
a
hand
to
help
them
till
monday
morning
meanwhile
a
messenger
was
speeding
on
his
way
to
new
haven
to
warn
the
parliamentarians
and
while
their
pursuers
were
kicking
their
heels
in
enforced
idleness
they
slipped
away
and
found
a
new
hiding
place
in
a
mill
some
miles
off
but
even
this
was
thought
not
to
be
safe
and
they
fled
once
more
and
at
length
found
refuge
in
a
cave
deep
in
the
forest
so
on
monday
when
at
length
the
royalists
arrived
the
birds
had
flown
the
minister
owned
that
they
had
been
there
but
declared
that
they
had
vanished
away
no
man
knowing
when
or
whither
the
royalists
scoured
the
country
far
and
wide
in
search
of
the
fugitives
but
their
efforts
were
in
vain
they
were
very
much
in
earnest
but
they
were
strangers
and
they
did
not
know
the
country
no
one
would
help
them
in
their
search
and
at
length
very
angry
with
the
people
of
new
haven
they
gave
it
up
and
returned
to
boston
then
having
spent
several
months
in
their
cave
the
parliamentarians
crept
forth
again
for
two
years
they
lived
hidden
in
a
friendly
house
the
king
however
was
not
satisfied
and
after
two
years
messengers
again
came
out
from
england
and
the
search
was
again
begun
more
eagerly
than
before
again
however
goffe
and
whalley
were
warned
and
again
they
fled
to
the
cave
here
they
lived
in
safety
while
the
royalists
swept
the
country
round
in
search
of
them
but
they
had
many
narrow
escapes
once
when
they
had
left
the
shelter
of
their
cave
they
were
almost
caught
their
pursuers
were
upon
their
heels
and
to
reach
the
cave
without
being
taken
prisoner
seemed
impossible
as
the
two
men
fled
before
their
foes
they
came
to
a
little
river
crossed
by
a
wooden
bridge
it
was
their
last
hope
instead
of
crossing
the
bridge
they
crept
beneath
it
and
crouched
close
to
the
water
on
came
the
pursuers
they
made
no
pause
their
horses
thundered
across
the
bridge
and
galloped
away
and
away
while
beneath
the
fugitives
waited
breathlessly
then
when
all
was
quiet
again
they
crept
back
to
the
shelter
of
their
cave
but
at
length
the
cave
became
a
safe
retreat
no
longer
for
it
was
discovered
by
the
indians
and
the
fugitives
afraid
lest
the
indians
tempted
by
the
large
reward
offered
might
betray
their
resolved
to
seek
another
by
this
time
the
fury
of
the
search
for
them
had
somewhat
abated
and
another
minister
john
russell
offered
them
a
refuge
in
his
house
this
minister
lived
at
a
place
called
hadley
hadley
was
many
miles
from
new
haven
it
was
a
lonely
settlement
on
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
and
to
reach
it
about
a
hundred
miles
of
pathless
forest
had
to
be
crossed
but
with
stout
hearts
the
hunted
men
set
out
by
day
they
lay
hidden
in
some
friendly
house
or
in
some
lonely
cave
or
other
refuge
by
night
they
journeyed
onward
at
length
they
reached
their
new
it
was
wonderfully
contrived
the
minister
had
lately
made
some
alterations
in
his
house
and
in
doing
so
he
had
made
a
safe
retreat
in
the
attic
there
was
a
large
cupboard
with
doors
opening
into
rooms
on
either
side
in
the
floor
of
the
cupboard
there
was
a
trap
door
which
led
down
into
another
dark
cupboard
below
and
from
there
a
passage
led
to
the
cellar
so
that
should
the
house
be
searched
any
one
in
the
upper
rooms
could
slip
into
the
cupboard
from
there
reach
the
cellar
and
thus
escape
here
the
regicides
now
took
up
their
abode
and
so
well
was
their
secret
kept
that
they
lived
there
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
their
presence
being
unsuspected
even
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
town
henceforth
the
world
was
dead
to
them
and
they
were
dead
to
the
world
they
were
both
soldiers
on
many
a
field
of
battle
marston
naseby
worcester
and
dunbar
had
led
their
men
to
victory
they
had
been
members
of
parliament
friends
of
the
great
protector
and
had
taken
part
in
all
the
doings
of
these
stirring
times
now
all
that
was
over
now
no
command
no
power
was
left
to
them
the
years
went
by
dragging
their
slow
length
of
days
and
bringing
no
change
or
brightness
to
the
lives
of
these
two
men
who
lived
in
secret
and
alone
it
was
a
melancholy
life
the
monotony
only
broken
by
visits
from
the
minister
or
a
few
other
friends
who
brought
them
all
the
gossip
and
news
of
the
town
these
were
but
small
matters
but
to
the
two
men
shut
off
from
all
other
human
beings
they
seemed
of
rare
interest
after
ten
years
whalley
died
it
is
believed
that
he
was
buried
in
the
cellar
of
the
house
in
which
for
so
long
he
had
found
a
then
for
five
years
or
so
more
goffe
dragged
out
his
life
alone
as
one
might
imagine
the
king
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
massachusetts
and
new
haven
for
thus
sheltering
the
regicides
and
in
he
suppressed
new
haven
as
a
separate
colony
and
joined
it
to
connecticut
the
new
haven
people
did
not
like
this
at
all
and
they
fought
against
it
with
all
their
might
but
at
length
they
gave
way
and
joined
connecticut
the
king
was
angry
with
massachusetts
too
not
only
for
protecting
the
regicides
but
also
because
of
what
is
known
as
the
declaration
of
rights
in
this
the
people
of
massachusetts
acknowledged
the
king
as
their
ruler
but
they
also
made
it
plain
that
so
long
as
they
did
not
make
laws
which
ran
counter
to
english
laws
they
expected
to
be
let
alone
this
made
king
charles
angry
and
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
was
busy
fighting
with
holland
very
likely
the
people
of
massachusetts
would
have
had
to
suffer
for
their
boldness
at
once
as
it
was
they
were
left
in
peace
a
little
longer
chapter
king
philip
war
meanwhile
the
people
of
new
england
had
another
foe
to
fight
you
remember
that
the
pilgrim
fathers
had
made
a
treaty
with
the
indians
when
they
first
arrived
as
long
as
the
old
chief
massasoit
lived
he
kept
that
treaty
but
now
he
was
dead
and
his
son
philip
ruled
you
will
wonder
perhaps
why
an
indian
chief
should
have
a
name
like
philip
but
philip
real
name
was
metacomet
he
however
wanted
to
have
an
english
name
and
to
please
him
the
english
called
him
philip
and
by
that
name
he
is
best
known
for
a
time
all
went
well
but
very
soon
philip
and
his
tribe
grew
restless
and
dissatisfied
when
they
saw
the
white
men
coming
in
always
greater
and
greater
numbers
and
building
towns
and
villages
further
and
further
into
the
land
they
began
to
fear
them
and
long
to
drive
them
away
and
at
length
all
their
thoughts
turned
to
war
friendly
indians
and
praying
indians
as
those
who
had
become
christians
were
called
came
now
to
warn
the
and
tell
them
that
philip
was
gathering
his
braves
and
that
he
had
held
a
war
dance
lasting
for
several
weeks
in
the
night
too
people
in
lonely
farms
awoke
to
hear
the
wild
sound
of
drums
and
gun
shots
but
still
the
english
hoped
to
pacify
philip
so
they
sent
him
a
friendly
letter
telling
him
to
send
away
his
braves
for
no
white
man
wished
him
ill
but
philip
returned
no
answer
then
one
sunday
while
the
people
were
at
church
and
the
houses
were
all
deserted
indians
attacked
the
little
town
of
swansea
burning
and
plundering
the
next
day
and
the
next
they
returned
tomahawk
and
firebrand
in
hand
and
so
the
war
began
other
tribes
joined
with
king
philip
and
soon
new
england
was
filled
with
terror
and
bloodshed
the
men
of
new
england
gathered
in
force
to
fight
the
indians
but
they
were
a
hard
foe
to
fight
for
they
never
came
out
to
meet
the
in
open
field
at
first
when
the
british
began
to
settle
in
america
they
had
made
it
a
rule
never
to
sell
firearms
to
the
indians
but
that
rule
had
long
ago
been
broken
through
now
the
indians
not
only
had
guns
but
many
of
them
were
as
good
shots
as
the
british
yet
they
kept
to
their
old
ways
of
fighting
and
stealthily
as
wild
animals
they
skulked
behind
trees
or
lurked
in
the
long
grass
seeking
their
enemies
they
knew
all
the
secret
forest
ways
they
were
swift
of
foot
untiring
and
mad
with
the
lust
of
blood
so
from
one
lonely
village
to
another
they
sped
swiftly
a
the
eagle
secretly
as
the
fox
and
where
they
passed
they
left
a
trail
of
blood
and
ashes
at
night
around
some
lonely
homestead
all
would
seem
quiet
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
would
be
no
slightest
sign
of
any
redman
and
the
tired
labourer
would
go
to
rest
feeling
safe
with
his
wife
and
children
beside
him
but
ere
the
first
red
streaks
of
dawn
shivered
across
the
sky
he
would
be
awakened
by
fiendish
yells
ere
he
could
seize
his
gun
the
savages
would
be
upon
him
and
the
sun
when
it
rose
would
show
only
blackened
ruins
where
but
a
few
hours
before
a
happy
home
had
been
yet
with
this
red
terror
on
every
side
the
people
went
on
quietly
with
their
daily
life
on
week
days
they
tilled
their
fields
and
minded
their
herds
on
sundays
they
went
as
usual
to
church
leaving
their
homes
deserted
but
even
to
church
they
went
armed
and
while
they
knelt
in
prayer
or
listened
to
the
words
of
their
pastor
their
guns
were
ever
within
reach
of
their
hands
one
sunday
while
in
the
village
of
hadley
the
people
were
all
at
church
the
indians
crept
up
in
their
usual
stealthy
fashion
suddenly
the
alarm
was
given
and
seizing
their
guns
which
stood
by
their
sides
the
men
rushed
out
of
the
but
they
were
all
in
confusion
the
attack
was
sudden
they
were
none
of
them
soldiers
but
merely
brave
men
ready
to
die
for
their
homes
and
their
dear
ones
and
they
had
and
they
had
no
leader
then
suddenly
a
stranger
appeared
amongst
them
he
was
dressed
in
quaint
clothes
his
hair
and
beard
were
long
and
streaked
with
grey
he
was
tall
and
soldierly
and
his
eyes
shone
with
the
joy
of
battle
at
once
he
took
command
sharply
his
orders
rang
out
unquestioningly
the
villagers
obeyed
for
he
spoke
as
one
used
to
command
they
were
no
longer
an
armed
crowd
but
a
company
of
soldiers
and
fired
by
the
courage
and
skill
of
their
leader
they
soon
put
the
indians
to
flight
when
the
fight
was
over
the
men
turned
to
thank
their
deliverer
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
vanished
as
quickly
and
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
what
did
it
mean
they
asked
who
was
the
strange
leader
had
god
in
his
mercy
sent
an
angel
from
heaven
to
their
rescue
no
one
could
answer
their
questions
and
many
decided
that
indeed
a
miracle
had
happened
and
that
god
had
sent
an
angel
to
deliver
them
this
strange
leader
was
no
other
than
the
regicide
colonel
goffe
who
as
we
know
had
for
many
years
lived
hidden
in
the
house
from
his
attic
window
he
had
seen
the
indians
creeping
stealthily
upon
the
village
and
when
he
saw
the
people
standing
leaderless
and
bewildered
he
had
been
seized
with
his
old
fighting
spirit
and
had
rushed
forth
to
lead
them
then
the
danger
being
over
he
had
slipped
quietly
back
to
his
there
he
remained
hidden
from
all
the
world
as
before
until
he
died
and
was
buried
beside
his
friend
autumn
passed
and
winter
came
and
the
indians
gathered
to
their
forts
for
the
bare
forests
gave
too
little
protection
to
them
in
their
kind
of
warfare
when
spring
came
they
promised
themselves
to
come
forth
again
and
make
an
end
of
the
but
the
did
not
wait
for
spring
the
indians
had
gathered
to
the
number
of
over
three
thousand
into
a
strong
fortress
it
was
surrounded
by
a
marsh
and
the
only
entrance
was
over
a
bridge
made
by
a
fallen
tree
this
fortress
the
new
englanders
decided
to
attack
and
take
so
a
thousand
strong
they
set
out
one
morning
before
dawn
and
after
hours
of
weary
marching
through
the
snow
they
reached
the
fort
across
the
narrow
bridge
they
rushed
and
although
many
of
their
leaders
fell
dead
the
men
came
on
nothing
daunted
a
fierce
fight
followed
for
each
side
knew
that
they
must
win
or
die
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
impassable
swamps
there
was
no
escape
but
not
till
dark
was
falling
did
the
white
men
gain
the
victory
the
ground
was
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
and
in
the
gathering
darkness
the
remaining
indians
stole
quietly
away
and
vanished
like
shadows
then
the
new
englanders
set
fire
to
the
wigwams
and
taking
their
wounded
marched
back
to
their
headquarters
this
was
a
sad
blow
to
the
indians
but
it
did
not
by
any
means
end
the
war
which
as
spring
came
on
broke
out
again
in
full
fury
but
gradually
the
white
men
got
the
upper
hand
instead
of
attacking
the
redmen
fled
before
them
they
lost
heart
and
began
to
blame
king
philip
for
having
led
them
into
war
and
at
length
he
was
slain
by
one
of
his
own
followers
soon
after
this
the
war
came
to
an
end
but
whole
tracts
of
new
england
were
a
desert
a
thousand
of
the
bravest
and
best
of
the
young
men
were
killed
many
women
and
children
too
had
been
slain
and
there
was
hardly
a
fireside
in
the
whole
of
massachusetts
where
there
was
not
a
vacant
place
numbers
of
people
were
utterly
ruined
and
the
colonies
were
burdened
with
a
great
debt
as
to
the
indians
their
power
was
utterly
broken
and
their
tribes
were
almost
wiped
out
except
the
mohegans
who
had
remained
friendly
throughout
the
war
there
were
few
indians
left
in
south
new
england
where
there
was
never
again
a
war
between
white
men
and
indians
chapter
how
the
charter
of
connecticut
was
saved
meanwhile
king
charles
had
not
forgotten
his
anger
against
the
people
of
massachusetts
besides
the
fact
that
they
had
harboured
the
regicides
he
had
many
other
reasons
for
being
angry
with
them
for
they
refused
to
obey
the
navigation
laws
and
they
refused
to
allow
the
church
of
england
to
be
established
within
the
colony
they
had
coined
money
of
their
own
never
made
their
officials
swear
allegiance
to
the
throne
and
had
done
many
things
just
as
they
liked
in
fact
massachusetts
seemed
to
charles
like
a
badly
child
who
having
come
to
manhood
wants
to
go
his
own
way
and
cares
nothing
for
the
wishes
or
commands
of
his
parents
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
have
any
more
of
this
disobedience
and
he
took
away
the
charter
and
made
massachusetts
a
crown
colony
thus
after
years
of
practical
freedom
massachusetts
once
more
belonged
to
the
king
of
england
by
right
of
the
discovery
of
john
and
sebastian
cabot
of
course
the
people
of
massachusetts
fought
against
this
as
hard
as
they
could
but
their
struggle
was
useless
and
a
royal
governor
was
appointed
to
rule
the
colony
almost
immediately
however
charles
died
and
it
was
not
until
his
brother
james
ii
was
on
the
throne
that
sir
edmund
andros
came
out
as
royal
governor
he
came
not
only
as
governor
of
massachusetts
but
as
governor
of
all
the
new
england
colonies
for
the
king
wanted
to
make
an
end
of
all
these
separate
colonies
and
unite
them
into
one
great
province
andros
soon
made
himself
very
much
disliked
for
he
tried
to
rule
new
england
too
much
as
his
master
tried
to
rule
great
britain
he
levied
taxes
as
he
pleased
he
imprisoned
innocent
men
if
he
chose
he
allowed
nothing
to
be
printed
without
his
permission
he
seized
lands
and
goods
at
will
all
new
england
felt
the
weight
of
the
governor
hand
he
demanded
rhode
island
charter
but
the
governor
of
rhode
island
replied
that
the
weather
was
so
bad
he
really
could
not
send
it
so
sir
edmund
went
to
rhode
island
dissolved
its
government
and
smashed
its
seal
to
connecticut
also
sir
edmund
wrote
in
vain
demanding
its
charter
the
men
of
connecticut
were
it
seemed
to
him
an
unruly
lot
so
one
october
day
in
he
set
out
to
visit
this
rebellious
state
and
subdue
it
to
his
will
he
arrived
in
hartford
with
a
great
train
of
gentlemen
and
soldiers
they
made
a
mighty
stir
in
the
little
town
as
they
rode
jingling
and
clanking
through
the
quiet
streets
and
drew
rein
before
the
state
house
into
the
chamber
where
the
council
sat
strode
andros
looking
pompous
and
grand
in
lace
and
velvet
and
a
great
flowing
wig
up
to
the
table
he
strode
and
in
tones
of
haughty
command
demanded
the
charter
but
the
men
of
connecticut
would
not
lightly
give
up
the
sign
of
their
beloved
liberty
they
talked
and
argued
and
persuaded
they
spoke
of
the
hardships
they
had
endured
of
the
blood
they
had
poured
forth
to
keep
their
freedom
in
their
new
found
homes
upon
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
but
with
such
a
man
as
andros
all
appeals
all
persuasions
were
in
vain
to
every
argument
he
had
but
one
answer
must
and
would
have
the
charter
long
and
long
the
argument
lasted
the
day
drew
to
a
close
and
twilight
fell
through
the
dusky
gloom
men
could
hardly
see
each
other
flushed
excited
faces
lights
were
called
for
and
candles
were
brought
some
were
placed
upon
the
table
beside
the
metal
box
in
which
lay
the
charter
still
the
debate
went
on
either
side
as
unbending
as
before
now
many
citizens
anxious
to
know
how
things
went
slipped
into
the
room
and
stood
behind
the
members
listening
as
the
debate
was
flung
this
way
and
that
outside
the
night
was
dark
within
the
woodpanelled
room
the
flickering
candles
shed
but
a
dim
uncertain
light
they
made
strange
dancing
shadows
shining
fitfully
on
the
stern
eager
faces
of
the
men
who
sat
round
the
table
but
scarcely
revealing
against
the
gloom
the
crowd
of
anxious
citizens
behind
sir
edmund
was
weary
of
the
talk
he
would
have
no
more
of
it
and
suddenly
rising
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
seize
the
charter
then
swiftly
from
out
the
shadowy
circle
of
listeners
a
cloak
was
flung
upon
the
table
it
fell
upon
the
candles
and
put
them
out
in
a
moment
the
room
was
in
total
darkness
there
was
an
outcry
and
a
scuffling
of
feet
the
sound
of
an
opening
window
a
call
for
lights
but
lights
were
no
such
speedy
matters
in
those
days
when
matches
had
not
been
invented
when
at
length
the
scratching
of
the
tinder
boxes
was
done
and
the
candles
relit
every
one
looked
eagerly
at
the
table
behold
the
charter
was
gone
sir
edmund
stormed
and
citizens
and
councilors
looked
blankly
at
each
other
but
meanwhile
through
the
darkness
a
man
sped
in
his
hand
he
held
a
parchment
and
he
never
halted
in
his
run
till
he
reached
a
great
oak
tree
this
oak
he
knew
was
hollow
reaching
it
he
thrust
the
parchment
deep
into
the
hole
and
carefully
covered
it
up
with
dried
leaves
and
bark
thus
was
the
charter
of
connecticut
saved
the
man
who
saved
it
was
captain
wadsworth
ever
afterwards
the
tree
was
called
the
charter
oak
and
until
about
sixty
years
ago
it
stood
a
memorial
of
his
deed
but
some
wise
folk
say
this
story
of
the
charter
oak
is
all
a
fairy
tale
that
may
be
so
but
it
deserves
to
be
true
yet
though
the
men
of
connecticut
may
have
succeeded
in
saving
the
sign
and
symbol
of
their
freedom
they
could
not
save
the
reality
for
whether
sir
edmund
andros
was
in
possession
of
their
charter
or
not
he
stamped
upon
their
liberties
just
the
same
in
the
public
record
the
secretary
wrote
his
excellency
sir
edmund
andros
knight
captain
general
and
governor
of
his
majesty
territory
and
dominion
in
new
england
by
order
from
his
majesty
king
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
the
of
october
took
into
his
hands
the
government
of
this
colony
of
connecticut
it
being
by
his
majesty
annexed
to
the
massachusetts
and
other
colonies
under
his
excellency
government
finis
finis
as
you
know
means
the
end
and
one
can
not
but
feel
sorry
for
that
stern
old
freedom
loving
puritan
gentleman
who
wrote
the
words
for
indeed
to
him
the
loss
of
freedom
must
have
seemed
the
end
of
all
things
sir
edmund
rule
however
did
not
last
long
for
the
british
soon
grew
tired
of
james
ii
and
his
tyrannous
ways
and
they
asked
prince
william
of
orange
to
come
and
be
their
king
william
came
the
people
received
him
with
delight
king
james
fled
away
to
france
and
the
glorious
revolution
as
it
was
called
was
accomplished
when
the
news
reached
new
england
there
too
was
a
little
revolution
one
spring
morning
there
was
a
great
commotion
among
the
people
of
boston
there
was
beating
of
drums
noise
and
shouting
and
much
running
to
and
fro
of
young
men
carrying
clubs
soon
it
was
seen
that
the
city
was
in
arms
the
men
marched
to
the
castle
and
demanded
its
surrender
and
andros
knowing
himself
to
be
helpless
yielded
though
not
without
some
stomachful
reluctances
the
proud
governor
rule
was
at
an
end
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
through
the
streets
where
he
had
ridden
in
splendour
he
was
now
led
a
captive
then
the
colonies
set
about
restoring
their
governments
as
they
had
been
before
sir
edmund
andros
came
but
andros
had
no
mind
to
remain
a
prisoner
he
and
his
friends
who
were
imprisoned
with
him
had
a
good
deal
of
freedom
they
were
locked
into
their
rooms
at
night
but
during
the
day
they
were
allowed
to
walk
about
anywhere
within
sight
of
the
sentries
and
their
friends
were
allowed
to
come
to
see
them
quite
freely
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
escape
thought
andros
and
he
resolved
to
do
it
so
he
bribed
one
of
his
jailers
and
having
procured
woman
clothes
he
dressed
himself
in
them
and
calmly
walked
out
of
his
prison
he
passed
two
sentries
safely
but
the
third
looked
sharply
at
the
tall
woman
who
strode
along
so
manfully
he
looked
at
her
boots
at
once
the
sentry
suspicions
were
aroused
for
sir
edmund
had
not
thought
of
changing
them
no
woman
ever
wore
such
boots
as
these
thought
the
sentry
and
he
challenged
and
stopped
her
then
peering
beneath
the
rim
of
her
bonnet
he
saw
no
bashful
woman
face
but
the
features
of
the
governor
so
back
to
prison
andros
went
after
this
he
was
not
allowed
so
much
freedom
but
again
he
tried
to
escape
and
this
time
he
was
more
successful
he
got
not
only
out
of
boston
but
out
of
the
colony
once
more
however
he
was
recognised
and
brought
back
the
whole
of
new
england
had
been
agog
with
excitement
but
at
length
things
began
to
calm
down
and
the
world
moved
on
in
its
old
orderly
pace
says
a
writer
of
the
times
in
the
midst
of
this
calm
two
ships
arrived
from
england
with
an
order
to
those
in
power
to
proclaim
william
and
mary
king
and
queen
then
the
colonies
went
mad
with
joy
from
far
and
near
the
people
flocked
to
boston
bells
were
rung
bonfires
blazed
and
after
a
great
procession
through
the
streets
there
was
feasting
at
the
townhall
thus
with
joy
splendour
appearance
and
unanimity
as
had
never
before
been
seen
in
these
territories
were
william
and
mary
proclaimed
sir
edmund
andros
was
now
sent
home
to
england
a
prisoner
but
king
william
was
not
altogether
pleased
with
all
the
colonists
had
done
and
he
was
set
free
without
any
trial
he
was
not
really
a
bad
man
but
he
was
dogged
and
without
sympathy
or
imagination
and
altogether
the
wrong
man
in
the
wrong
place
later
on
he
came
back
to
america
as
governor
of
virginia
and
this
time
he
did
much
better
meanwhile
several
changes
were
made
in
new
england
rhode
island
and
connecticut
kept
their
old
charters
to
which
they
had
clung
so
lovingly
new
hampshire
too
remained
a
separate
colony
but
plymouth
sad
to
say
that
gallant
little
colony
founded
by
the
pilgrim
fathers
lost
separate
existence
and
became
part
of
massachusetts
maine
and
even
nova
scotia
lately
won
from
the
french
were
for
the
meantime
also
joined
to
massachusetts
massachusetts
was
now
a
great
colony
and
received
a
new
charter
but
things
were
not
the
same
the
colony
was
now
a
royal
province
and
the
governor
was
no
longer
appointed
by
the
people
but
by
the
king
this
chafed
the
people
greatly
for
they
felt
that
their
old
freedom
was
gone
so
for
a
time
the
history
of
massachusetts
was
hardly
more
than
a
dreary
chronicle
of
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
between
governor
and
people
chapter
the
witches
of
salem
we
have
all
read
stories
about
witches
but
we
do
not
really
believe
in
them
they
are
exciting
enough
to
read
about
but
we
know
they
are
merely
sort
of
folk
who
are
only
to
be
met
with
in
books
and
not
in
real
life
we
should
be
very
much
astonished
and
rather
frightened
perhaps
if
we
thought
that
witches
were
real
and
that
we
might
some
day
meet
one
but
in
those
days
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
very
many
people
believed
in
witches
although
not
always
so
it
was
generally
very
old
people
people
who
had
grown
ugly
and
witless
with
age
who
were
accused
of
being
witches
in
almost
any
village
might
be
seen
poor
old
creatures
toothless
hollow
cheeked
wrinkled
with
nose
and
chin
almost
meeting
bent
almost
double
they
walked
about
with
a
crutch
shaking
and
mumbling
as
they
went
if
any
one
had
an
ache
or
a
pain
it
was
easily
accounted
for
for
why
they
were
bewitched
the
poor
old
crone
was
the
witch
who
had
cast
the
evil
eye
upon
them
and
sometimes
these
poor
creatures
were
put
to
death
for
their
deeds
of
witchcraft
people
believed
that
these
witches
sold
themselves
to
the
evil
one
and
that
he
gave
them
power
to
harm
other
people
and
what
made
them
more
dangerous
was
the
fact
that
they
did
not
need
to
go
near
people
to
harm
them
but
could
do
evil
at
a
distance
by
thinking
wicked
thoughts
or
saying
wicked
words
some
even
of
the
most
saintly
and
most
learned
people
believed
in
witches
and
witchcraft
so
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
the
fact
that
suddenly
in
whole
towns
and
villages
of
new
england
were
thrown
into
a
ferment
of
terror
by
stories
of
witchcraft
it
came
about
quite
simply
two
little
girls
of
nine
and
eleven
the
niece
and
daughter
of
a
minister
named
samuel
parris
who
lived
in
salem
village
began
suddenly
to
behave
in
a
most
curious
manner
they
would
creep
into
holes
hide
under
chairs
and
benches
twist
themselves
into
queer
positions
make
curious
gestures
and
weird
noises
and
talk
arrant
nonsense
their
parents
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
and
so
they
called
in
the
doctors
nowadays
a
clever
doctor
would
have
found
out
pretty
soon
that
the
children
were
merely
pretending
and
playing
a
foolish
trick
upon
their
elders
but
in
those
days
doctors
were
not
very
wise
and
they
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
new
and
strange
disease
one
of
them
however
said
he
thought
that
the
children
must
be
bewitched
that
was
a
terrible
thought
and
at
once
the
minister
called
in
all
the
other
ministers
from
round
about
and
they
spent
a
day
fasting
and
praying
that
the
children
might
be
released
from
the
evil
enchantment
all
the
neighbours
too
came
crowding
to
the
house
eager
to
hear
about
the
dreadful
happenings
and
the
children
finding
themselves
all
at
once
people
of
the
first
importance
and
no
doubt
enjoying
the
fuss
which
was
being
made
went
on
more
than
ever
with
their
mad
antics
it
was
quite
plain
to
every
one
that
the
children
were
bewitched
but
who
had
done
it
every
day
the
children
were
asked
this
question
and
at
length
they
accused
a
poor
old
indian
woman
who
was
a
servant
in
the
family
and
the
poor
old
creature
was
beaten
and
terrified
until
she
actually
confessed
that
she
was
a
witch
and
in
league
with
the
evil
one
perhaps
the
children
had
a
spite
against
the
old
woman
perhaps
they
did
not
realise
at
first
how
wicked
and
cruel
they
were
certainly
when
they
found
what
excitement
they
caused
and
how
interesting
they
had
become
to
every
one
they
forgot
all
else
they
became
bolder
now
and
accused
other
old
women
soon
more
and
older
girls
joined
them
and
many
innocent
people
both
men
and
women
were
accused
by
them
of
witchcraft
they
did
all
sorts
of
things
to
make
people
believe
in
these
accusations
as
soon
as
an
old
woman
was
brought
in
they
would
fall
down
on
the
ground
screaming
if
she
moved
they
would
cry
out
that
she
was
crushing
them
to
death
if
she
bit
her
lip
they
would
declare
that
she
was
biting
them
and
so
on
they
told
strange
tales
too
of
how
they
had
been
made
to
write
in
a
long
thick
red
book
the
book
of
the
evil
one
they
talked
a
jumble
of
nonsense
about
a
black
man
a
black
dog
and
a
yellow
bird
they
would
seem
to
fall
down
in
fits
or
to
be
struck
dumb
and
they
so
worked
upon
the
superstitious
fears
of
those
present
that
at
length
both
judges
and
jury
carried
away
by
mysterious
terror
would
condemn
the
old
woman
to
death
soon
a
kind
of
madness
took
possession
of
the
people
person
after
person
was
accused
wrongs
and
misfortunes
ten
or
even
twenty
years
old
were
remembered
and
charged
to
this
person
or
that
no
man
or
woman
was
safe
neither
age
nor
youth
beauty
learning
nor
goodness
were
any
safeguard
not
only
the
good
name
but
the
very
life
of
every
man
was
at
the
mercy
of
every
other
man
terror
and
mistrust
stalked
abroad
and
entered
every
home
parents
accused
their
children
children
their
parents
husbands
and
wives
turned
against
each
other
until
the
prisons
were
filled
to
overflowing
it
was
quite
useless
for
the
prisoners
to
declare
that
they
were
innocent
few
believed
them
if
any
did
they
hardly
dare
say
so
lest
they
should
find
themselves
accused
in
their
turn
and
lodged
in
prison
yet
at
length
some
were
brave
enough
to
stand
by
their
loved
ones
one
determined
young
man
with
great
difficulty
succeeded
in
rescuing
his
mother
from
prison
in
getting
out
the
poor
woman
broke
her
leg
but
her
son
lifted
her
on
to
his
horse
and
carried
her
away
to
a
swamp
near
by
here
he
built
her
a
hut
and
brought
her
food
and
kept
her
safe
until
all
danger
was
passed
one
or
two
other
men
escaped
with
their
wives
and
fled
beyond
the
borders
of
the
colony
twenty
however
were
put
to
death
by
hanging
among
them
a
minister
all
these
twenty
to
the
last
declared
their
innocence
many
others
strange
to
say
confessed
to
being
witches
they
confessed
because
they
were
terrified
into
it
many
confessed
because
they
saw
that
by
so
doing
they
might
save
their
lives
but
some
having
confessed
were
so
distressed
at
having
lied
that
they
took
back
their
confession
then
they
were
hanged
without
mercy
for
a
year
this
terrible
madness
lasted
then
it
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
the
people
awoke
again
to
their
right
senses
the
prison
doors
were
opened
and
the
poor
innocent
people
were
set
free
the
wicked
children
who
had
accused
them
were
never
punished
unless
their
own
hearts
punished
them
one
of
them
at
least
repented
bitterly
and
years
later
openly
acknowledged
her
sorrow
for
her
share
in
the
sad
business
the
minister
in
whose
house
the
persecution
began
was
punished
for
the
people
were
so
angry
with
him
and
the
part
he
had
taken
that
they
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
leave
salem
village
some
others
who
had
taken
as
great
a
part
as
he
in
hounding
guiltless
people
to
death
remained
impenitent
and
unpunished
but
the
jury
and
some
of
the
judges
made
some
amends
they
did
a
hard
thing
for
they
publicly
acknowledged
that
they
had
been
wrong
the
jury
wrote
and
signed
a
paper
in
which
they
said
we
do
hereby
declare
that
we
justly
fear
that
we
were
sadly
deluded
and
mistaken
for
which
we
are
much
disquieted
and
distressed
in
our
minds
and
do
therefore
humbly
beg
forgiveness
one
of
the
judges
judge
sewall
was
bitterly
grieved
at
the
part
he
had
played
and
on
a
day
of
general
intercession
he
stood
up
before
the
whole
congregation
acknowledging
his
guilt
and
praying
god
to
forgive
him
and
throughout
all
his
life
he
kept
one
day
a
year
upon
which
he
prayed
and
fasted
in
repentance
perhaps
you
may
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
story
to
make
you
proud
of
your
ancestors
but
think
again
think
of
the
courage
of
those
men
and
women
who
cheerfully
went
to
death
rather
than
save
their
lives
by
lying
and
making
false
confessions
truth
to
those
brave
men
and
women
was
worth
more
than
life
and
is
there
nothing
to
be
proud
of
in
the
fact
that
the
judge
and
jury
when
they
found
themselves
in
the
wrong
had
the
manliness
to
own
it
publicly
and
without
reserve
to
some
of
us
nothing
in
all
the
world
seems
so
hard
as
to
own
ourselves
in
the
wrong
part
iv
stories
of
the
middle
and
southern
colonies
chapter
the
founding
of
maryland
about
the
same
time
as
gorges
was
making
laws
for
his
little
kingdom
of
new
hampshire
another
english
gentleman
was
doing
much
the
same
somewhat
farther
south
this
was
lord
baltimore
the
first
lord
baltimore
was
a
yorkshire
gentleman
named
calvert
he
was
a
favourite
of
james
i
who
made
him
a
baron
and
he
took
his
title
from
a
tiny
village
in
ireland
like
so
many
other
men
of
his
time
lord
baltimore
was
interested
in
america
and
wanted
to
found
a
colony
there
first
he
tried
to
found
one
in
newfoundland
there
he
received
a
large
grant
of
land
which
he
called
avalon
after
the
fabled
land
in
the
story
of
king
arthur
and
he
had
a
kind
of
fairy
vision
of
the
warmth
and
sunny
delights
which
were
to
be
found
in
his
new
land
but
instead
of
being
warm
and
sunny
he
found
that
newfoundland
was
bleak
and
cold
so
his
fairy
vision
shriveled
and
died
and
be
came
home
and
asked
for
a
grant
of
land
on
the
potomac
instead
in
king
james
gave
lord
baltimore
what
he
asked
and
called
the
land
maryland
in
honour
of
his
wife
queen
henrietta
maria
but
before
the
grant
was
sealed
with
the
king
broad
seal
lord
baltimore
died
not
he
therefore
but
his
son
cecilius
was
the
first
lord
proprietary
of
maryland
and
for
his
broad
lands
all
he
had
to
pay
to
king
james
was
two
indian
arrows
to
be
delivered
at
windsor
castle
every
year
on
tuesday
in
easter
week
he
had
also
to
pay
part
of
all
the
gold
and
silver
which
might
be
found
within
his
borders
but
no
gold
or
silver
was
found
in
the
colony
so
there
was
nothing
to
pay
lord
baltimore
did
not
himself
go
to
america
but
sent
his
brother
leonard
calvert
as
governor
maryland
was
not
founded
like
the
puritan
colonies
for
religious
purposes
but
like
new
hampshire
merely
for
trade
and
profit
but
in
those
days
religion
and
religious
strife
entered
into
everything
so
it
did
into
the
founding
of
maryland
for
lord
baltimore
was
a
catholic
and
in
england
roman
catholics
in
their
turn
as
well
as
dissenters
were
persecuted
and
lord
baltimore
hoped
to
found
a
refuge
for
them
in
his
new
possessions
in
america
so
although
in
the
charter
given
by
a
protestant
king
the
church
of
england
was
recognised
as
the
state
religion
in
reality
there
was
great
religious
freedom
in
maryland
and
for
a
time
it
was
there
only
that
catholics
found
freedom
in
america
but
in
order
to
secure
toleration
for
the
catholic
religion
lord
baltimore
found
himself
obliged
to
tolerate
all
others
so
men
of
all
creeds
came
to
settle
in
maryland
and
find
freedom
the
people
of
virginia
were
very
far
from
pleased
when
they
heard
of
the
new
colony
about
to
be
planted
so
near
them
for
part
of
the
land
which
had
been
given
to
lord
baltimore
they
claimed
as
their
own
and
they
looked
upon
the
newcomers
as
intruders
on
their
territory
and
resolved
to
maintain
their
rights
they
did
all
they
could
to
prevent
the
new
settlers
coming
nevertheless
in
spite
of
everything
leonard
calvert
set
sail
with
his
colonists
many
of
whom
were
people
in
two
ships
called
the
ark
and
the
dove
they
had
a
prosperous
voyage
and
landed
in
virginia
full
of
doubt
lest
the
inhabitants
who
were
very
angry
at
their
coming
should
be
plotting
something
against
them
but
the
letters
which
they
carried
from
the
king
seemed
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
virginians
for
a
little
and
the
newcomers
sailed
on
again
to
their
own
destination
in
chesapeake
bay
so
at
length
they
reached
the
country
and
calvert
landed
with
solemn
state
to
take
possession
of
the
land
in
the
name
of
god
and
the
king
of
england
as
he
stepped
ashore
a
salute
was
fired
from
the
boats
then
reverently
kneeling
the
colonists
listened
while
mass
was
said
for
the
first
time
in
english
america
mass
being
over
they
formed
a
procession
at
the
head
of
which
a
rough
wooden
cross
was
carried
then
when
they
reached
a
spot
chosen
beforehand
they
planted
the
cross
and
kneeling
round
it
chanted
the
litany
of
the
sacred
cross
with
great
fervour
and
thus
a
new
colony
was
begun
with
the
indians
calvert
made
friends
for
he
was
both
just
and
kind
to
them
paying
them
for
their
land
in
hoes
hatchets
coloured
cloths
and
the
beads
and
they
loved
so
in
those
early
days
there
were
no
indian
wars
and
massacres
in
maryland
but
although
at
peace
with
the
redmen
the
marylanders
were
not
at
peace
with
their
fellow
white
men
for
the
virginians
could
not
forget
that
lord
baltimore
had
taken
land
which
they
had
looked
upon
as
their
own
they
had
done
their
best
to
hinder
him
coming
at
all
and
now
that
he
had
come
they
did
their
best
to
drive
him
away
again
they
tried
to
stir
up
mischief
between
the
newcomers
and
the
indians
by
telling
the
indians
that
these
newcomers
were
spaniards
and
enemies
of
the
english
nation
they
complained
to
the
people
in
power
at
home
and
did
everything
they
could
to
make
maryland
an
uncomfortable
dwelling
place
for
those
they
looked
upon
as
interlopers
the
chief
enemy
of
the
marylanders
among
the
virginians
was
a
man
named
william
clayborne
before
the
coming
of
these
new
colonists
he
had
settled
himself
upon
the
isle
of
kent
which
was
within
their
bounds
and
now
he
absolutely
refused
either
to
move
or
to
recognise
the
authority
of
calvert
as
governor
for
he
claimed
the
isle
of
kent
as
part
of
virginia
calvert
on
his
side
insisted
on
his
rights
and
as
neither
would
give
way
it
came
at
length
to
fighting
there
was
bloodshed
on
both
sides
now
one
now
the
other
getting
the
upper
hand
each
appealed
in
turn
to
king
parliament
or
protector
and
so
for
more
than
twenty
years
the
quarrel
went
on
but
when
the
great
cromwell
came
to
power
he
took
lord
baltimore
part
catholic
though
he
was
and
at
length
in
weary
perhaps
of
the
struggle
each
side
gave
way
a
little
and
there
was
peace
between
the
two
colonies
but
in
spite
of
the
constant
trouble
with
clayborne
the
colony
grew
and
prospered
for
there
was
greater
religious
freedom
to
be
found
there
than
anywhere
else
either
in
england
or
america
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
religion
bulked
more
largely
in
an
thoughts
than
almost
anything
else
then
in
the
governor
issued
an
act
called
the
toleration
act
which
has
made
him
famous
it
gave
freedom
to
every
one
to
follow
his
own
religion
save
jews
and
unitarians
and
for
those
days
it
was
a
wonderfully
liberal
and
act
it
threatened
with
a
fine
of
ten
shillings
any
one
who
should
in
scorn
or

man

maryland
becomes
a
royal
province
time
went
on
and
the
great
estate
of
maryland
passed
from
one
lord
baltimore
to
another
although
founded
as
a
refuge
for
catholics
there
were
far
more
protestants
than
catholics
within
the
colony
and
when
william
iii
the
protestant
king
came
to
the
throne
he
deprived
baltimore
of
his
rights
and
made
maryland
a
royal
province
the
church
of
england
was
then
established
and
catholics
forbidden
to
hold
services
thus
lord
baltimore
dream
of
providing
a
refuge
for
the
oppressed
was
at
an
end
but
in
benedict
the
fourth
lord
baltimore
became
a
protestant
and
maryland
was
given
back
to
him
it
remained
in
possession
of
his
family
until
the
revolution
chapter
how
new
amsterdam
became
new
york
all
the
colonies
which
we
have
so
far
talked
about
were
founded
by
englishmen
now
we
come
to
one
which
was
founded
by
another
people
who
like
the
english
were
great
sea
rovers
and
dutch
even
before
the
landing
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
the
dutch
laid
claim
to
the
valleys
of
the
hudson
and
the
delaware
in
those
days
people
still
knew
very
little
about
the
continent
of
north
america
they
knew
it
was
a
continent
but
they
did
not
believe
it
to
be
very
wide
as
is
proved
by
charters
like
that
of
virginia
which
made
the
colony
extend
from
sea
to
sea
nor
did
people
know
how
long
the
continent
was
they
had
no
idea
that
the
great
double
continent
stretched
from
north
to
south
all
across
the
hemisphere
and
they
were
continually
seeking
for
that
passage
which
would
lead
them
to
india
by
way
of
the
west
now
in
henry
hudson
an
english
sailor
in
the
pay
of
the
dutch
came
seeking
the
passage
he
did
not
find
it
but
sailed
into
delaware
bay
and
up
the
beautiful
river
which
is
now
known
by
his
name
as
far
as
where
the
town
of
albany
now
stands
it
was
autumn
when
hudson
sailed
up
the
river
the
sky
was
gloriously
blue
and
the
woods
aflame
with
red
and
yellow
and
he
went
home
to
tell
the
dutch
that
he
had
found
as
pleasant
a
land
with
grass
and
flowers
and
goodly
trees
as
ever
he
had
seen
a
very
good
land
to
fall
with
and
a
pleasant
land
to
see
by
right
of
hudson
discoveries
the
dutch
claimed
all
the
land
between
cape
cod
and
chesapeake
bay
and
tempted
by
his
glowing
descriptions
they
very
soon
established
trading
ports
upon
the
hudson
which
they
called
the
north
river
the
delaware
they
called
the
south
river
the
english
too
claimed
the
same
land
and
it
was
not
until
some
years
after
the
landing
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
that
the
dutch
settled
in
the
country
then
they
formed
a
company
and
bought
the
island
of
manhattan
where
new
york
now
stands
from
the
indians
for
about
five
pounds
worth
of
glass
beads
and
other
trifles
here
they
built
a
little
fort
which
they
called
new
amsterdam
in
the
colony
grew
slowly
for
the
life
was
by
no
means
an
easy
one
and
the
people
of
holland
lived
in
freedom
and
religious
peace
at
home
so
they
had
no
need
to
cross
the
atlantic
to
seek
them
but
the
company
wanted
settlers
they
therefore
offered
to
give
an
estate
with
eighteen
miles
bay
or
river
frontage
to
every
man
who
would
bring
or
send
fifty
colonists
many
people
at
once
became
eager
to
win
such
a
prize
and
very
soon
there
were
little
settlements
all
along
the
shores
of
the
hudson
the
men
who
received
these
huge
estates
were
called
patroons
which
is
the
same
word
as
our
english
patron
and
they
had
power
not
unlike
the
feudal
lords
of
old
time
they
were
bound
to
supply
each
of
their
settlers
with
a
farm
and
also
to
provide
a
minister
and
a
schoolmaster
for
every
settlement
but
on
the
other
hand
they
had
full
power
over
the
settlers
they
were
the
rulers
and
judges
while
the
settlers
were
almost
serfs
and
were
bound
to
stay
for
ten
years
with
their
patroon
to
grind
their
corn
at
his
mills
and
pay
him
tribute
over
the
whole
colony
there
was
a
governor
who
was
as
a
rule
autocratic
and
sometimes
dishonest
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
unrest
in
the
colony
the
patroons
were
soon
at
loggerheads
with
each
other
and
with
the
governor
there
were
quarrels
with
the
swedes
who
had
settled
on
the
delaware
and
there
was
terrible
fighting
with
the
indians
at
length
the
state
of
the
colony
became
so
bad
that
the
settlers
wrote
home
to
holland
complaining
of
their
governor
and
blaming
him
for
all
their
troubles
the
people
in
holland
listened
to
this
complaint
and
a
new
governor
was
sent
out
this
was
peter
stuyvesant
the
last
and
most
famous
of
the
governors
of
new
amsterdam
peter
stuyvesant
governor
from
he
was
a
fiery
old
fellow
with
a
great
love
of
pomp
and
a
tremendous
opinion
of
his
own
importance
he
had
lost
a
leg
in
the
spanish
wars
and
now
he
stamped
about
with
a
wooden
one
but
as
no
plain
wooden
leg
would
please
his
taste
for
grandeur
he
had
it
bound
with
silver
the
people
were
heartily
tired
of
their
old
governor
so
they
hailed
the
coming
of
stuyvesant
with
joy
but
no
sooner
had
their
new
governor
arrived
than
they
began
to
wonder
if
after
all
the
change
was
a
happy
one
for
stuyvesant
seemed
to
look
down
upon
them
all
he
landed
with
great
state
and
pomp
and
some
of
the
chief
inhabitants
who
had
come
to
meet
him
were
left
standing
bareheaded
for
several
hours
while
he
kept
his
hat
on
as
if
he
were
tsar
of
all
the
russias
when
he
took
over
the
direction
of
affairs
from
the
late
governor
he
did
it
with
great
ceremony
in
presence
of
all
the
colonists
and
the
late
governor
thinking
to
make
a
good
impression
before
he
left
made
a
speech
thanking
the
people
for
their
faithfulness
to
him
but
the
stolid
dutchmen
were
not
going
to
have
any
such
farce
so
they
up
and
told
him
boldly
that
they
would
not
thank
him
for
they
had
no
reason
to
do
so
stuyvesant
however
would
not
have
any
wrangling
he
loudly
and
proudly
declared
that
every
one
should
have
justice
done
to
him
and
that
he
would
be
to
them
as
a
father
to
his
children
but
his
bearing
was
so
haughty
that
some
of
them
went
away
shaking
their
heads
and
fearing
that
he
would
be
but
a
harsh
father
and
so
it
proved
if
the
settlers
lot
had
been
hard
under
the
rule
of
other
governors
it
was
still
harder
under
that
of
stuyvesant
he
was
autocratic
and
hectoring
he
stumped
about
with
his
wooden
leg
and
shouted
every
one
else
down
and
no
one
dared
oppose
him
some
indeed
more
brave
than
others
declared
that
they
would
write
home
to
holland
to
complain
of
his
tyranny
but
when
stuyvesant
heard
it
he
got
so
angry
that
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
if
any
one
appeals
from
my
judgments
he
shouted
i
shall
make
him
a
foot
shorter
and
send
the
pieces
to
holland
let
him
appeal
in
that
way
but
stuyvesant
with
all
his
faults
was
a
far
better
governor
than
those
who
had
gone
before
him
and
he
had
no
easy
post
for
on
every
side
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
other
states
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
constantly
encroaching
on
the
borders
of
new
netherland
the
english
both
from
massachusetts
and
connecticut
seemed
to
think
that
the
dutch
had
no
rights
at
all
where
they
found
good
land
they
settled
scoffing
at
the
dutch
remonstrances
stuyvesant
too
was
soon
at
loggerheads
with
the
swedes
who
had
settled
on
the
delaware
the
dutch
claimed
both
sides
of
the
river
and
the
swedes
laughed
at
their
claims
they
would
sail
up
the
river
past
the
dutch
fort
without
stopping
and
displaying
their
colours
and
when
challenged
and
asked
for
their
reason
replied
boldly
that
they
would
certainly
do
it
again
then
the
dutch
began
to
build
a
new
fort
on
land
which
the
swedes
claimed
and
the
swedes
came
and
destroyed
it
so
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
until
at
length
stuyvesant
decided
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
gathered
an
army
of
six
hundred
men
the
largest
army
that
had
ever
been
gathered
in
north
america
and
with
seven
ships
entered
the
delaware
against
a
force
like
this
the
swedes
could
not
defend
themselves
so
they
yielded
on
condition
that
they
should
march
out
of
their
forts
with
all
the
honours
of
war
this
was
granted
to
them
and
with
colours
flying
drums
beating
and
trumpets
playing
the
swedes
marched
out
and
the
dutch
marched
in
thus
without
a
blow
after
seventeen
years
of
occupation
new
sweden
became
part
of
new
netherland
later
on
this
land
captured
from
the
swedes
was
to
become
the
state
of
delaware
from
his
triumph
over
the
swedes
stuyvesant
was
recalled
by
the
news
that
there
was
war
with
the
indians
he
soon
brought
that
to
an
end
also
but
he
was
not
always
to
be
victorious
and
at
length
the
time
came
when
the
power
of
the
dutch
was
to
be
swept
away
before
a
still
greater
power
stuyvesant
had
ruled
new
netherland
for
seventeen
years
the
colony
had
prospered
and
the
number
of
new
settlers
had
steadily
increased
during
these
same
years
great
britain
had
been
passing
through
stormy
times
king
charles
had
been
beheaded
the
kingdom
had
been
declared
a
commonwealth
with
cromwell
at
its
head
but
he
was
now
dead
the
stuarts
once
more
ruled
and
king
charles
ii
sat
upon
the
throne
he
cast
a
greedy
eye
upon
new
netherland
for
he
wanted
it
for
his
brother
the
duke
of
york
there
was
peace
between
holland
and
britain
but
charles
ii
cared
little
about
that
so
in
he
secretly
granted
all
the
land
lying
between
the
delaware
and
connecticut
rivers
to
his
brother
and
sent
a
fleet
of
four
ships
and
about
four
hundred
soldiers
under
colonel
richard
nicolls
to
take
possession
of
the
country
when
stuyvesant
heard
of
it
he
made
ready
to
resist
he
gathered
in
what
powder
and
shot
be
could
from
the
surrounding
settlements
he
mounted
cannon
he
ordered
every
man
to
take
his
turn
at
strengthening
the
fortifications
and
keeping
guard
and
having
done
all
he
could
he
sent
a
messenger
to
nicolls
asking
why
he
had
come
nicolls
reply
was
a
summons
to
surrender
the
town
at
the
same
time
he
promised
that
any
one
who
would
submit
quietly
should
be
protected
by
his
majesty
laws
and
justice
any
people
from
the
netherlands
may
freely
come
and
plant
here
he
wrote
vessels
of
their
own
country
may
freely
come
hither
and
any
of
them
may
as
freely
return
home
in
vessels
of
their
own
country
but
peter
stuyvesant
was
hot
to
fight
so
lest
the
easy
terms
should
make
any
of
the
settlers
willing
to
give
in
he
tried
to
keep
them
secret
but
the
council
would
not
have
it
so
all
that
regards
the
public
welfare
must
be
made
public
they
said
and
held
to
it
then
seeing
he
could
not
move
them
from
their
determination
in
a
fit
of
passion
stuyvesant
tore
nicolls
letter
in
pieces
swearing
that
he
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
consequences
the
people
were
growing
impatient
and
leaving
their
work
upon
the
fortifications
they
stormed
into
the
council
chamber
in
vain
stuyvesant
tried
to
persuade
them
to
return
to
their
work
they
would
not
listen
to
him
they
replied
to
him
only
with
curses
and
groans
then
from
all
sides
came
cries
of
the
letter
the
letter
we
will
have
the
letter
so
at
last
stuyvesant
yielded
the
torn
fragments
were
gathered
together
and
a
copy
made
and
when
the
people
heard
the
terms
they
bade
him
yield
still
he
would
not
and
he
sent
another
message
to
nicolls
but
nicolls
would
not
listen
he
said
i
will
speak
with
you
at
manhattan
friends
will
be
welcome
replied
the
messenger
if
they
come
in
friendly
fashion
i
shall
come
with
my
ships
and
my
soldiers
answered
nicolls
hoist
the
white
flag
of
peace
on
the
fort
and
then
something
may
be
considered
when
this
answer
was
known
terror
seized
the
town
women
and
children
came
to
implore
the
governor
with
tears
to
submit
he
would
not
listen
to
them
like
the
fierce
old
lion
he
was
he
knit
his
brows
and
stamped
with
his
wooden
leg
i
would
rather
be
carried
a
corpse
to
my
grave
than
give
in
he
cried
but
he
alone
had
any
desire
to
fight
for
in
the
whole
fort
there
was
not
enough
powder
to
last
one
day
from
the
river
front
there
was
absolutely
no
protection
and
on
the
north
there
was
only
a
rickety
fence
three
or
four
feet
high
there
was
little
food
within
the
fort
and
not
a
single
well
so
all
the
chief
inhabitants
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
begging
him
to
give
in
you
know
in
your
own
conscience
they
said
that
your
fortress
is
incapable
of
making
head
three
days
against
so
powerful
an
enemy
and
god
help
us
whether
we
turn
us
for
assistance
to
the
north
or
to
the
south
to
the
east
or
to
the
west
is
all
in
vain
on
all
sides
are
we
encompassed
and
hemmed
in
by
our
enemies
therefore
we
humbly
and
in
bitterness
of
heart
implore
your
honour
not
to
reject
the
conditions
of
so
generous
a
foe
this
letter
was
signed
by
all
the
most
important
people
of
the
town
even
by
stuyvesant
own
son
with
every
one
against
him
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
so
he
yielded
and
at
eight
on
monday
morning
the
of
september
he
marched
out
of
fort
amsterdam
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
with
colours
flying
and
drums
beating
they
marched
down
to
the
riverside
where
a
ship
awaited
them
and
getting
on
board
they
set
sail
for
holland
then
the
dutch
flag
was
hauled
down
the
british
flag
was
hoisted
in
its
place
and
new
amsterdam
became
new
york
a
name
given
it
in
honour
of
the
king
brother
the
duke
of
york
a
few
weeks
later
every
other
dutch
settlement
had
yielded
to
the
british
fort
orange
became
fort
albany
so
named
for
the
duke
of
york
second
title
and
dutch
dominion
in
north
america
was
at
an
end
as
to
stuyvesant
he
sailed
home
and
was
severely
scolded
by
the
west
india
company
for
his
scandalous
surrender
he
was
however
able
to
defend
himself
and
prove
to
the
directors
that
he
had
done
his
best
then
he
returned
to
america
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
quietly
on
his
farm
or
bowery
as
it
was
called
in
dutch
those
of
you
who
are
familiar
with
new
york
know
that
there
is
still
a
part
of
it
called
the
bowery
and
it
may
interest
you
to
learn
that
it
is
so
called
in
memory
of
the
farm
where
this
arrogant
old
lion
of
a
dutchman
spent
his
last
days
he
spent
them
peacefully
and
happily
now
that
he
was
no
longer
a
ruler
he
lost
much
of
his
overbearing
pride
and
all
that
was
kindly
in
his
nature
showed
itself
many
who
had
feared
and
hated
him
came
to
love
and
admire
him
among
others
he
made
friends
with
the
englishman
who
had
ousted
him
and
many
a
jolly
evening
he
and
nicolls
spent
together
cracking
jokes
and
listening
to
each
other
stories
of
the
brave
days
gone
by
peter
stuyvesant
died
at
the
age
of
eighty
and
was
buried
in
what
is
now
mark
church
where
a
tablet
on
the
wall
marks
the
spot
where
he
lies
new
york
was
now
a
proprietary
colony
like
maryland
its
overlord
being
the
duke
of
york
and
when
in
he
became
king
of
england
new
york
became
a
crown
colony
the
dutch
rule
had
been
autocratic
the
people
having
little
say
in
the
government
they
had
chafed
against
it
and
had
hoped
that
the
change
of
ruler
would
bring
a
change
of
government
and
that
they
would
be
allowed
freedom
like
the
new
england
colonies
but
james
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
allow
freedom
to
people
when
he
could
prevent
it
so
the
government
of
new
york
continued
as
autocratic
as
before
meanwhile
new
york
once
more
changed
hands
in
a
time
of
peace
the
british
had
calmly
and
without
a
shadow
of
right
taken
the
colony
from
the
dutch
nine
years
later
when
the
two
countries
were
at
war
the
dutch
took
it
back
again
it
was
just
the
same
story
over
again
only
this
time
it
was
the
dutch
who
marched
in
and
hoisted
the
dutch
flag
over
the
fort
once
more
the
names
were
changed
new
york
became
new
orange
and
the
province
was
once
more
new
amsterdam
but
this
was
only
for
a
month
or
two
the
following
year
holland
and
britain
made
peace
and
by
the
treaty
of
westminster
all
dutch
possessions
in
north
america
were
given
back
to
britain
and
dutch
rule
in
north
america
was
at
an
end
for
ever
chapter
how
a
german
ruled
new
york
when
sir
edmund
andros
came
to
america
he
had
been
made
governor
of
new
york
as
well
as
of
all
new
england
and
while
massachusetts
was
having
its
revolution
upon
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
there
were
exciting
times
in
new
york
also
when
the
news
of
the
imprisonment
of
andros
reached
new
york
there
was
great
agitation
almost
at
the
same
time
came
the
news
that
the
french
had
declared
war
on
england
which
added
to
the
people
excitement
for
they
suspected
nicholson
whom
andros
had
left
in
charge
as
of
being
a
catholic
and
a
quite
groundless
idea
got
about
that
he
meant
to
betray
the
colony
into
the
hands
of
the
french
or
burn
it
to
the
ground
there
were
very
few
catholics
in
new
york
and
the
protestants
had
little
need
to
fear
them
but
many
of
the
protestants
were
filled
with
a
burning
zeal
for
their
faith
and
of
these
jacob
leisler
an
honest
ignorant
german
now
became
the
leader
he
refused
to
pay
a
tax
because
the
tax
collector
was
a
papist
and
therefore
no
fit
person
to
receive
the
money
other
people
followed
his
example
and
day
by
day
excitement
grew
at
length
leisler
was
at
the
head
of
a
great
following
he
got
command
of
the
fort
and
drew
up
a
declaration
which
he
forced
the
captain
of
the
militia
and
others
to
sign
in
this
he
declared
that
the
city
was
in
danger
and
that
he
would
take
possession
of
it
until
king
william
should
appoint
a
governor
nicholson
had
no
grit
he
could
not
stand
against
a
bold
blusterer
like
leisler
so
he
ran
away
he
went
home
to
render
an
account
of
the
present
deplorable
state
of
affairs
to
king
william
but
in
order
that
nicholson
should
not
have
it
all
his
own
way
at
home
leisler
on
his
side
sent
an
innkeeper
joost
stoll
as
his
ambassador
to
king
william
to
explain
matters
from
his
point
of
view
leisler
now
became
very
autocratic
he
called
himself
he
disarmed
and
arrested
all
the
papists
and
every
one
was
a
papist
who
did
not
yield
readily
to
him
he
had
enormous
power
in
his
hands
for
good
or
evil
but
he
was
far
too
ignorant
and
vain
to
use
it
well
indeed
he
used
it
so
badly
that
even
some
of
the
men
who
had
hailed
him
with
delight
turned
against
him
leisler
by
many
signs
knew
his
popularity
was
failing
then
his
friend
the
innkeeper
returned
from
england
with
the
doleful
news
that
king
william
had
taken
not
the
slightest
notice
of
him
the
king
indeed
would
not
deign
to
recognise
the
existence
of
the
upstart
german
governor
and
had
appointed
a
new
governor
who
would
shortly
arrive
in
new
york
this
was
bad
news
for
leisler
and
it
seemed
to
drive
him
crazy
he
grew
more
and
more
tyrannical
at
length
his
tyranny
became
so
bad
that
many
of
the
chief
people
of
new
york
wrote
a
letter
to
the
king
and
queen
complaining
of
it
in
this
letter
they
told
the
king
and
queen
that
they
were
sore
oppressed
by
ill
men
who
ruled
in
new
york
by
the
sword
at
the
sole
will
of
an
insolent
alien
assisted
by
some
few
whom
we
can
give
no
better
name
than
a
rabble
from
other
parts
of
the
colony
too
letters
were
written
calling
leisler
a
bold
usurper
and
begging
the
king
to
do
something
to
break
this
heavy
yoke
of
worse
than
egyptian
bondage
nor
did
the
people
confine
themselves
to
writing
letters
leisler
found
himself
insulted
at
every
turn
he
was
mobbed
and
stoned
and
called
dog
driver
general
hog
and
other
ugly
names
meanwhile
on
the
stormy
seas
the
ships
bringing
out
the
new
governor
and
were
being
tossed
hither
and
thither
the
waves
dashed
high
the
wind
drove
the
ships
helplessly
before
it
and
the
archangel
which
bore
the
governor
was
separated
from
the
others
and
driven
far
out
of
its
course
thus
it
happened
that
ingoldsby
the
arrived
in
new
york
without
the
governor
however
he
sent
to
leisler
asking
him
to
allow
the
soldiers
he
had
brought
to
enter
the
fort
this
request
made
leisler
very
angry
he
refused
to
allow
the
soldiers
to
enter
the
fort
unless
ingoldsby
showed
him
orders
in
writing
either
from
the
king
or
governor
this
ingoldsby
could
not
do
for
all
the
orders
were
in
the
governor
ship
and
where
that
was
he
could
not
tell
and
finding
that
leisler
would
yield
to
no
reasoning
after
four
days
he
landed
his
men
with
as
much
care
as
if
he
had
been
making
a
descent
into
an
enemy
country
and
lodged
them
in
the
town
hall
so
six
weeks
passed
ingoldsby
was
determined
to
stay
leisler
just
as
determined
that
he
should
go
at
length
leisler
sent
ingoldsby
a
notice
to
disband
his
force
in
two
hours
or
take
the
consequences
ingoldsby
refused
to
disband
his
force
so
from
the
fort
leisler
fired
upon
the
soldiers
in
the
town
hall
and
several
were
killed
more
trouble
seemed
likely
to
follow
but
some
of
leisler
soldiers
had
already
had
enough
so
they
laid
down
their
arms
and
went
home
next
day
governor
sloughter
arrived
hearing
of
all
the
commotion
he
landed
hastily
and
going
to
the
town
hall
ordered
the
bell
to
be
rung
and
his
commission
to
be
read
to
the
people
then
he
sent
ingoldsby
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
fort
but
leisler
was
by
this
time
crazy
with
the
idea
of
his
own
importance
he
refused
to
give
up
the
fort
until
he
received
orders
from
the
king
direct
addressed
to
his
very
own
self
this
was
absurd
for
the
king
was
hardly
conscious
of
leisler
existence
the
governor
therefore
paid
no
attention
to
these
proud
demands
and
sent
ingoldsby
again
to
demand
possession
of
the
fort
again
leisler
refused
it
could
not
be
done
so
easily
as
all
that
he
said
still
a
third
time
the
governor
demanded
the
fort
and
again
with
scorn
leisler
refused
it
was
now
nearly
midnight
and
the
governor
decided
to
do
nothing
more
till
morning
with
morning
reason
seemed
to
return
to
leisler
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
begging
him
to
take
the
fort
but
the
governor
took
no
notice
of
the
letter
he
simply
sent
ingoldsby
to
command
the
garrison
to
give
up
their
arms
and
march
out
promising
at
the
same
time
free
pardon
to
every
one
except
leisler
and
his
council
the
men
obeyed
at
once
they
marched
out
and
leisler
found
himself
a
prisoner
for
two
years
he
had
lorded
it
in
new
york
now
his
day
was
done
after
a
short
trial
he
and
his
friend
and
milborne
were
condemned
to
death
and
hanged
as
traitors
at
the
time
many
applauded
this
severity
but
afterwards
most
people
were
sorry
for
after
all
leisler
had
meant
well
and
in
spite
of
his
arrogance
he
had
still
many
friends
left
he
was
now
looked
upon
as
a
martyr
and
for
many
a
long
day
new
york
was
torn
asunder
with
bitter
strife
over
his
tragic
ending
chapter
pirates
colonel
sloughter
whose
rule
began
in
such
stormy
times
proved
no
good
governor
indeed
he
was
a
bad
man
as
well
as
a
bad
ruler
others
followed
who
were
not
a
bit
better
one
at
least
being
accused
of
being
in
league
with
the
pirates
who
were
now
the
terror
of
the
seas
the
seventeenth
century
has
been
called
the
golden
age
of
piracy
never
before
or
since
have
pirates
had
such
a
splendid
time
after
the
discovery
of
america
the
number
of
ships
sailing
the
seas
increased
rapidly
until
all
the
chief
countries
of
europe
had
far
more
ships
afloat
than
they
could
possibly
protect
with
their
navies
so
they
readily
became
a
prey
to
pirates
then
as
they
could
not
protect
their
merchantmen
with
their
warships
most
countries
allowed
private
people
in
time
of
war
to
fit
out
ships
armed
with
guns
to
capture
the
merchant
shipping
of
the
enemy
these
ships
were
simply
private
men
of
war
and
were
called
privateers
they
always
carried
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
which
gave
them
the
legal
right
to
commit
against
enemy
ships
acts
which
without
those
letters
of
marque
would
have
been
considered
acts
of
piracy
in
the
long
run
these
privateers
often
became
little
better
than
pirates
and
it
has
been
said
privateers
in
time
of
war
were
a
nursery
for
pirates
against
a
peace
the
pirates
life
was
one
of
reckless
daring
they
were
idle
swaggering
brutal
all
the
summer
they
sailed
the
seas
a
terror
to
peaceful
merchantmen
and
when
winter
came
or
when
they
were
tired
of
plundering
they
would
retire
to
the
west
india
islands
or
madagascar
here
hidden
in
the
depths
of
forests
they
built
for
themselves
strong
castles
surrounded
by
moats
and
walls
the
paths
leading
to
these
castles
were
made
with
the
greatest
cunning
they
were
so
narrow
that
people
could
only
go
in
single
file
they
crossed
and
in
every
direction
so
that
the
castle
was
surrounded
by
a
maze
and
any
one
not
knowing
the
secret
might
wander
for
hours
without
being
able
to
find
the
dwelling
which
could
not
be
seen
until
one
was
close
upon
it
in
these
savage
fastnesses
the
pirates
lived
in
squalid
splendour
they
had
numbers
of
slaves
to
wait
upon
them
the
finest
wines
and
foods
the
richest
dress
and
jewels
spoils
of
their
travels
and
when
they
had
drunk
and
rioted
in
idleness
to
their
heart
content
they
would
once
more
set
sail
and
roam
the
seas
in
search
of
fresh
adventure
all
sorts
of
people
took
to
piracy
and
scampish
sons
of
noble
houses
might
be
found
side
by
side
with
the
lowest
of
scoundrels
and
vagabonds
in
fact
in
those
days
any
man
who
had
a
grudge
against
the
world
might
turn
pirate
even
women
were
found
among
them
a
jovial
brutal
crew
they
swaggered
and
swore
their
way
through
life
and
if
the
gallows
at
the
end
always
loomed
over
them
what
then
there
was
always
plenty
of
rum
in
which
to
drown
the
thought
some
of
the
pirates
became
very
famous
the
very
sight
of
the
jolly
roger
as
the
pirates
black
flag
was
called
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
merchantmen
and
it
is
said
that
one
pirate
captured
and
sunk
as
many
as
four
hundred
ships
before
he
was
caught
yet
these
ruffians
often
had
dealings
with
seemingly
respectable
tradesmen
having
captured
a
few
ships
and
taken
all
the
booty
on
board
his
own
the
pirate
would
sail
for
some
port
there
he
would
show
some
old
letters
of
marque
swear
that
he
was
a
privateer
and
had
captured
the
goods
lawfully
from
the
enemy
for
the
world
was
always
at
war
in
those
days
and
as
the
goods
were
going
cheap
too
many
questions
would
not
be
asked
thus
a
profitable
trade
was
done
the
navigation
laws
too
helped
pirates
to
thrive
on
the
coasts
of
america
for
they
seemed
so
unjust
and
burdensome
that
people
thought
it
no
wrong
to
evade
them
so
often
piracy
and
smuggling
went
hand
in
hand
at
length
piracy
grew
so
bad
that
people
felt
that
something
must
be
done
to
stop
it
and
when
an
irishman
named
lord
bellomont
came
out
as
governor
in
he
set
about
doing
it
it
was
decided
that
the
best
way
to
do
it
was
to
send
a
swift
and
frigate
under
a
captain
who
knew
their
haunts
and
ways
to
catch
these
for
this
captain
kidd
a
tried
sailor
was
chosen
and
he
set
sail
with
a
somewhat
ruffianly
crew
in
the
ship
adventure
but
captain
kidd
was
unlucky
though
he
roamed
the
seas
and
sought
the
pirates
in
the
haunts
he
knew
so
well
he
found
never
a
one
nor
could
he
find
even
enemy
ships
which
as
a
privateer
he
might
have
attacked
dutch
ships
ships
of
the
great
mogul
he
met
but
britain
was
at
peace
with
holland
and
on
most
friendly
terms
with
the
heathen
potentate
pirates
and
ships
of
france
he
could
not
find
food
and
money
were
nearly
gone
the
crew
grew
mutinous
they
had
come
forth
for
adventure
and
not
to
sail
the
seas
thus
tamely
and
on
short
rations
to
boot
so
there
was
angry
talk
between
the
crew
and
captain
plainly
they
told
him
that
the
next
ship
which
came
in
sight
be
it
friend
or
foe
should
be
their
prey
kidd
grew
furious
and
seizing
a
hatchet
he
hit
one
of
the
men
on
the
head
so
that
he
fell
senseless
on
the
deck
and
died
alone
he
stood
against
his
mutinous
crew
but
in
the
end
he
gave
way
to
them
he
turned
pirate
and
any
ship
which
came
his
way
was
treated
as
a
lawful
prize
for
two
years
after
captain
kidd
left
new
york
nothing
was
heard
of
him
then
strange
and
disquieting
rumours
came
home
it
was
said
that
he
who
had
been
sent
to
hunt
pirates
had
turned
pirate
himself
that
he
who
had
been
sent
as
a
protection
had
become
a
terror
to
honest
traders
so
orders
were
accordingly
sent
to
lord
bellomont
to
arrest
captain
kidd
a
royal
proclamation
was
also
issued
offering
free
pardon
to
all
pirates
save
two
one
of
whom
was
william
kidd
this
was
the
news
which
greeted
the
pirate
when
he
arrived
one
day
at
a
port
in
the
west
indies
but
those
were
lawless
days
captain
kidd
ship
was
laden
with
great
enough
he
thought
to
win
forgiveness
at
least
he
decided
to
brazen
it
out
and
he
set
sail
for
new
york
his
ship
was
no
longer
the
adventure
but
the
quedah
merchant
for
the
adventure
being
much
battered
after
two
years
seafaring
he
had
sunk
her
and
taken
one
of
his
many
prizes
instead
but
on
the
way
home
he
left
the
quedah
merchant
at
san
domingo
with
all
her
rich
cargo
and
taking
only
the
gold
and
jewels
he
set
sail
again
in
a
small
sloop
as
he
neared
new
york
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
began
to
think
that
after
all
forgiveness
might
not
be
won
so
easily
cautiously
he
crept
up
to
new
york
only
to
learn
that
the
governor
was
at
boston
so
he
sent
a
messenger
to
the
governor
confessing
that
acts
of
piracy
had
been
committed
but
without
his
authority
they
were
done
he
said
when
the
men
were
in
a
state
of
mutiny
and
had
locked
him
up
in
his
cabin
lord
bellomont
was
and
just
and
had
no
desire
to
condemn
a
man
unheard
so
he
sent
back
a
message
to
captain
kidd
saying
if
you
can
prove
your
story
true
you
can
rely
on
me
to
protect
you
but
captain
kidd
story
did
not
satisfy
lord
bellomont
so
he
was
put
into
prison
and
later
sent
home
to
england
to
be
tried
there
he
was
condemned
to
death
and
hanged
as
a
pirate
in
some
people
however
never
believed
in
his
guilt
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
did
not
have
a
fair
trial
and
that
he
was
by
no
means
the
shameless
ruffian
he
was
made
out
to
be
what
became
of
the
quedah
merchant
and
all
her
rich
cargo
was
never
known
indeed
the
most
of
kidd
gains
entirely
disappeared
for
when
his
sloop
was
searched
very
little
treasure
was
found
so
then
it
was
said
that
captain
kidd
must
have
buried
his
treasure
somewhere
before
he
reached
boston
and
for
a
hundred
years
and
more
afterwards
all
along
the
shore
of
long
island
sound
people
now
and
again
would
start
a
search
of
buried
treasure
but
none
was
ever
found
before
his
pirate
friend
met
his
end
lord
bellomont
died
he
was
one
of
the
few
governors
the
people
had
loved
and
they
sorrowed
truly
at
his
death
he
was
followed
by
lord
cornby
a
very
bad
man
nevertheless
in
spite
of
governors
good
and
bad
new
york
prospered
every
fresh
tyranny
in
europe
which
sent
to
america
added
to
the
population
and
as
the
first
settlers
were
dutch
new
york
had
a
more
population
than
almost
any
other
of
the
colonies
chapter
the
founding
of
new
jersey
out
of
new
york
another
state
had
been
carved
for
before
new
york
had
been
taken
from
the
dutch
before
nicholls
had
so
much
as
reached
the
shores
of
america
james
duke
of
york
had
already
given
part
of
the
land
which
he
did
not
yet
possess
to
two
of
his
friends
lord
berkeley
and
sir
george
carteret
sir
george
had
been
governor
of
the
island
of
jersey
in
the
english
channel
when
the
revolution
broke
out
in
england
he
had
defended
the
island
stoutly
against
the
soldiers
of
the
parliament
and
had
kept
the
king
flag
flying
on
british
soil
longer
than
any
other
man
so
now
that
the
stuarts
were
restored
king
charles
remembered
carteret
loyalty
and
he
called
this
tract
of
land
new
jersey
in
his
honour
for
this
great
estate
sir
george
and
lord
berkeley
had
to
pay
only
ten
shillings
a
year
and
a
peppercorn
nicholls
of
course
knew
nothing
about
these
grants
and
when
he
heard
of
them
he
was
grieved
that
the
duke
should
have
given
away
so
much
valuable
land
he
had
besides
allowed
some
puritans
from
new
england
and
others
to
settle
on
the
land
after
making
agreements
with
the
natives
and
this
led
to
trouble
later
on
meanwhile
sir
george
lost
no
time
in
settling
his
land
in
his
own
way
he
at
once
sent
out
some
colonists
and
philip
carteret
a
cousin
of
his
own
as
governor
on
a
summer
day
in
philip
carteret
landed
he
set
up
no
crosses
and
made
no
prayers
but
with
a
hoe
over
his
shoulder
he
marched
at
the
head
of
his
men
as
a
sign
that
he
meant
to
live
and
work
among
them
a
little
way
inland
he
chose
a
spot
on
which
to
build
his
town
and
called
it
elizabeth
in
honour
of
sir
george
carteret
wife
things
went
well
enough
until
the
time
came
for
rents
to
be
paid
then
many
of
the
settlers
who
had
been
there
before
carteret
came
refused
to
pay
for
they
said
they
had
bought
their
land
from
the
indians
and
owed
nothing
to
sir
george
but
as
the
governor
insisted
on
his
right
they
rose
in
rebellion
they
held
a
meeting
at
elizabethtown
deposed
philip
carteret
and
chose
james
carteret
a
weak
and
bad
son
of
sir
george
as
their
governor
seeing
nothing
else
for
it
philip
went
home
and
laid
his
case
before
sir
george
and
the
duke
they
both
supported
him
so
the
rebels
submitted
james
carteret
went
off
to
new
york
and
philip
again
became
governor
of
new
jersey
meanwhile
lord
berkeley
had
grown
tired
of
all
the
trouble
and
he
sold
his
part
of
new
jersey
to
some
quakers
so
henceforth
new
jersey
was
divided
into
two
east
jersey
and
west
jersey
east
jersey
belonging
to
carteret
west
jersey
to
the
quakers
in
sir
george
carteret
died
and
his
part
of
new
jersey
was
also
sold
to
quakers
one
of
whom
was
william
penn
afterwards
to
become
famous
in
american
history
soon
after
this
new
jersey
fell
on
very
troublous
times
of
which
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
but
at
length
the
two
jerseys
were
again
made
into
one
and
in
the
time
of
anne
the
colony
became
a
royal
province
then
for
years
it
was
united
to
new
york
but
in
was
again
divided
and
has
remained
a
separate
state
ever
since
chapter
the
founding
of
pennsylvania
like
other
persecuted
people
the
quakers
sought
a
refuge
in
america
but
even
there
they
were
not
welcomed
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
who
had
fled
from
persecution
themselves
turned
persecutors
as
we
have
seen
the
quakers
discovered
that
for
them
there
was
no
paradise
of
peace
in
the
lands
beyond
the
sea
but
when
george
carteret
sold
his
part
of
new
jersey
quakers
bought
it
a
young
man
named
william
penn
being
one
of
these
quakers
this
william
penn
was
the
son
of
sir
william
penn
an
admiral
in
the
british
navy
and
a
friend
of
king
charles
i
he
was
a
royalist
and
a
churchman
and
when
his
handsome
young
son
turned
quaker
he
was
greatly
grieved
at
first
indeed
he
was
so
angry
that
he
turned
young
william
out
of
the
house
later
however
seeing
that
his
son
was
quite
determined
to
be
a
quaker
the
admiral
forgave
him
and
before
he
died
he
asked
the
duke
of
york
to
be
kind
to
him
the
duke
of
york
promised
he
would
and
then
there
began
a
strange
friendship
between
the
catholic
prince
and
the
quaker
after
the
quakers
bought
new
jersey
a
great
many
went
there
they
found
not
only
a
large
amount
of
freedom
but
a
kindly
government
for
william
penn
framed
the
laws
the
quaker
colony
of
new
jersey
was
to
a
certain
extent
a
success
but
there
were
troubles
with
neighbouring
states
and
troubles
with
other
claimants
of
the
land
so
at
length
exactly
when
we
do
not
know
the
idea
of
founding
a
real
quaker
colony
came
into
mind
when
admiral
penn
died
the
king
owed
him
and
william
penn
inherited
that
claim
so
he
asked
the
king
to
pay
the
debt
not
in
money
but
in
land
in
america
the
extent
of
the
land
asked
for
was
exceedingly
vague
but
it
was
at
least
as
big
as
the
whole
of
england
charles
however
was
always
in
want
of
money
so
in
he
was
pleased
enough
to
give
away
this
great
tract
of
land
which
after
all
was
his
more
by
imagination
than
anything
else
and
get
rid
of
his
debt
and
acquire
also
the
possibility
of
getting
some
gold
as
well
for
in
return
for
his
land
penn
agreed
to
pay
two
beaver
skins
a
year
and
a
fifth
of
all
the
gold
or
silver
which
might
be
mined
within
his
territory
charles
not
only
gave
penn
the
land
but
named
it
too
penn
meant
to
call
his
new
country
new
wales
but
a
welshman
who
hated
the
quakers
objected
to
the
name
of
his
land
being
given
to
a
quaker
colony
so
penn
changed
it
to
sylvania
meaning
woodland
because
of
the
magnificent
forests
which
were
there
but
the
king
added
penn
to
sylvania
thus
calling
it
penn
woodlands
william
penn
however
was
afraid
that
people
would
think
that
this
was
vanity
on
his
part
and
that
he
had
called
his
province
after
himself
so
he
tried
to
have
the
name
changed
he
even
bribed
the
king
secretary
to
do
it
but
in
vain
as
some
one
has
said
if
he
had
bribed
the
king
himself
he
might
have
succeeded
better
as
it
was
he
did
not
succeed
for
king
charles
was
very
pleased
with
the
name
no
laughed
the
merry
monarch
when
penn
asked
him
to
change
it
we
will
keep
the
name
but
you
need
not
flatter
yourself
that
it
is
called
after
you
it
is
so
called
after
your
gallant
father
so
as
the
king
insisted
penn
had
to
submit
and
he
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
as
penn
means
hill
the
name
might
be
taken
to
mean
wooded
hills
the
tract
of
land
of
which
penn
now
became
possessed
was
smiling
and
fertile
and
altogether
desirable
it
had
only
one
fault
and
that
was
that
it
had
no
sea
coast
in
a
new
country
where
there
were
no
roads
and
where
communication
inland
was
difficult
that
was
a
great
drawback
so
penn
persuaded
the
duke
of
york
to
give
him
that
part
of
his
province
on
which
the
swedes
had
settled
and
which
the
dutch
had
taken
from
the
swedes
on
the
west
shores
of
delaware
bay
later
this
formed
the
state
of
delaware
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
governed
as
a
part
of
pennsylvania
everything
thus
being
settled
and
the
charter
being
granted
penn
drew
up
a
form
of
government
for
his
colony
chose
his
cousin
william
markham
as
governor
and
sent
him
off
in
the
autumn
of
with
three
shiploads
of
settlers
with
markham
penn
sent
a
kindly
letter
to
the
swedes
of
delaware
telling
them
that
he
was
now
their
governor
i
hope
you
will
not
be
troubled
at
the
change
he
said
for
you
are
now
fixed
at
the
mercy
of
no
governor
who
comes
to
make
his
fortune
you
shall
be
governed
by
laws
of
your
own
making
and
live
a
free
and
if
you
will
a
sober
and
industrious
people
i
shall
not
usurp
the
right
of
any
or
oppress
his
person
penn
also
sent
a
letter
to
the
indians
there
is
a
great
god
he
said
that
hath
made
the
world
and
all
things
therein
to
whom
you
and
i
and
all
people
owe
their
being
this
great
god
hath
written
his
law
in
our
hearts
by
which
we
are
taught
and
commanded
to
love
and
help
and
do
good
to
one
another
now
this
great
god
hath
been
pleased
to
make
me
concerned
in
your
part
of
the
world
and
the
king
of
the
country
where
i
live
hath
given
me
a
great
province
therein
but
i
desire
to
enjoy
it
with
your
love
and
consent
that
we
may
always
live
together
as
neighbours
and
friends
else
what
would
the
great
god
do
to
us
with
this
letter
penn
sent
presents
to
the
indian
chiefs
and
told
them
that
he
would
soon
come
to
see
them
himself
and
make
arrangements
about
the
land
but
it
was
not
till
the
following
year
that
penn
set
out
for
his
colony
when
he
landed
the
dutch
and
swedes
greeted
him
with
joy
and
to
show
that
they
acknowledged
him
as
their
governor
they
presented
him
as
in
old
feudal
times
with
a
sod
of
earth
a
bowl
of
water
and
a
branch
of
a
tree
penn
then
passed
on
to
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
capital
and
as
showing
forth
the
spirit
in
which
his
colony
was
founded
he
called
his
city
philadelphia
or
the
city
of
brotherly
love
it
was
near
this
town
that
penn
met
the
indian
chiefs
and
made
a
treaty
with
them
as
he
had
promised
to
do
in
the
indian
language
the
spot
was
called
the
place
of
kings
and
had
been
used
as
a
meeting
place
by
the
surrounding
tribes
for
long
ages
here
there
grew
a
splendid
elm
a
hoary
giant
of
the
forest
which
for
a
hundred
years
and
more
had
withstood
the
tempests
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
this
tree
penn
took
his
stand
he
was
young
and
handsome
and
although
he
wore
the
simple
garb
of
the
quakers
he
had
not
yet
perhaps
quite
forgotten
the
modish
ways
of
his
younger
days
for
about
his
waist
he
had
knotted
a
pale
blue
scarf
beside
him
stood
his
cousin
the
deputy
governor
and
a
few
more
soberly
clad
quakers
in
front
of
them
in
a
great
half
circle
were
ranged
the
indians
the
old
men
in
front
the
behind
and
last
of
all
the
young
men
they
were
gorgeous
in
paint
and
feathers
and
armed
with
hatchets
bows
and
arrows
but
the
quakers
carried
no
weapons
of
any
kind
greetings
being
over
an
ancient
warrior
advanced
and
amid
deep
silence
tied
a
horn
upon
his
forehead
this
was
the
sign
of
his
greatness
and
also
a
sign
that
the
spot
was
sacred
immediately
all
the
braves
threw
down
their
weapons
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
grass
then
the
old
warrior
announced
that
they
were
ready
to
hear
the
words
of
the
white
chief
then
penn
spoke
to
the
gathered
indians
reminding
them
that
the
great
spirit
wished
all
men
to
live
in
love
and
brotherhood
and
as
the
redman
listened
his
heart
went
out
in
love
to
this
white
chief
who
had
friendship
in
his
eyes
and
kindliness
in
his
voice
and
there
under
the
spreading
branches
of
the
great
elm
tree
they
swore
to
live
in
peace
and
brotherly
love
as
long
as
the
rivers
shall
run
and
while
the
sun
moon
and
stars
endure
these
indians
never
broke
their
word
and
for
the
next
seventy
years
there
was
peace
in
pennsylvania
between
the
redman
and
the
white
the
indians
gave
penn
the
name
of
onas
which
is
the
algonquin
word
for
feather
ever
afterwards
too
they
called
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
onas
and
whoever
and
whatever
he
was
for
them
he
was
great
and
good
but
penn
was
not
only
the
great
chief
onas
he
was
also
father
penn
for
he
roamed
the
woods
with
the
indians
talking
with
them
and
sharing
their
simple
food
like
one
of
themselves
this
greatly
delighted
the
indians
and
to
show
their
pleasure
they
would
perform
some
of
their
wild
dances
then
up
penn
would
spring
and
dance
with
the
best
of
them
so
he
won
their
hearts
they
loved
him
so
much
that
the
highest
praise
they
could
give
any
man
was
to
say
he
is
like
the
great
onas
and
it
was
said
that
any
one
dressed
like
a
quaker
was
far
safer
among
the
indians
than
one
who
carried
a
gun
life
seemed
so
easy
in
pennsylvania
that
in
the
first
years
thousands
of
colonists
came
flocking
to
the
new
colony
it
grew
faster
than
any
other
colony
so
fast
indeed
that
houses
could
not
be
built
quickly
enough
so
for
a
time
many
of
the
new
settlers
had
to
live
in
caves
dug
out
of
the
banks
of
the
delaware
river
it
was
in
one
of
these
caves
that
the
first
baby
citizen
of
the
city
of
brotherly
love
was
born
pennsylvania
prospered
and
grew
fast
but
there
were
constant
troubles
with
lord
baltimore
about
the
border
line
between
his
province
and
penn
the
british
kings
in
those
days
gave
land
charters
in
the
most
reckless
fashion
and
over
and
over
again
the
boundaries
of
one
province
overlapped
those
of
the
others
then
of
course
there
was
trouble
this
had
happened
with
virginia
and
maryland
now
it
happened
with
maryland
and
pennsylvania
the
quarrel
at
length
became
so
bad
that
penn
went
home
to
england
to
have
the
matter
settled
after
that
for
a
time
things
were
better
but
the
quarrel
was
not
really
settled
it
was
not
settled
until
many
years
after
both
penn
and
lord
baltimore
were
dead
then
in
two
english
astronomers
charles
mason
and
jeremiah
dixon
surveyed
and
fixed
the
boundary
which
ever
since
has
been
known
as
the
mason
and
dixon
line
every
mile
a
small
stone
was
placed
with
b
on
one
side
and
p
on
the
other
along
the
eastern
part
too
every
five
miles
a
larger
stone
was
placed
with
the
arms
of
penn
on
one
side
and
those
of
baltimore
on
the
other
but
further
west
these
were
discontinued
for
in
those
days
when
there
were
few
roads
it
was
difficult
to
get
these
heavy
stones
carried
to
the
proper
places
when
penn
went
back
to
england
he
had
meant
to
return
to
his
colony
very
soon
but
fifteen
years
passed
before
be
was
able
to
do
so
during
this
time
king
charles
ii
who
had
given
him
the
charter
for
his
great
possessions
died
and
his
brother
james
who
as
duke
of
york
had
been
penn
friend
was
driven
from
the
throne
then
for
a
time
penn
great
province
was
taken
from
him
because
he
was
suspected
of
helping
his
old
friend
the
dethroned
king
the
colony
was
then
placed
under
the
control
of
the
governor
of
new
york
two
years
later
however
penn
was
cleared
from
the
charge
of
treason
and
his
right
to
pennsylvania
was
again
recognised
then
once
more
he
crossed
the
seas
to
visit
his
possessions
in
the
new
world
he
found
that
in
fifteen
years
great
changes
had
been
wrought
the
two
or
three
thousand
inhabitants
had
now
increased
to
twenty
thousand
many
of
the
new
settlers
were
not
quakers
but
protestants
from
germany
holland
and
sweden
and
presbyterians
from
scotland
and
ireland
penn
welcomed
them
all
but
they
on
their
side
had
grown
apart
from
him
they
were
no
longer
his
children
he
was
no
longer
father
penn
but
the
governor
and
proprietor
from
this
governor
the
settlers
demanded
greater
liberties
than
they
had
penn
was
grieved
but
he
met
the
clamour
in
the
most
generous
spirit
friends
he
said
if
in
the
constitution
there
be
anything
that
jars
alter
it
so
it
was
altered
until
practically
the
colonists
became
a
people
now
for
a
second
time
penn
felt
himself
obliged
to
return
to
england
he
did
not
want
to
go
but
longed
to
live
out
the
rest
of
his
life
in
his
colony
which
in
spite
of
all
troubles
and
difficulties
be
loved
dearly
i
can
not
think
of
such
a
voyage
without
great
reluctance
he
said
for
i
promised
myself
that
i
might
stay
so
long
at
least
with
you
as
to
render
everybody
entirely
easy
and
safe
for
my
heart
is
among
you
as
well
as
my
body
whatever
some
people
may
please
to
think
and
no
unkindness
or
disappointment
shall
ever
be
able
to
alter
my
love
to
the
country
so
with
just
a
little
soreness
in
his
heart
penn
sailed
away
never
to
return
at
home
trouble
and
misfortune
awaited
him
and
in
the
midst
of
his
troubles
sickness
fell
upon
him
for
six
years
a
helpless
invalid
with
failing
mind
he
lingered
on
then
in
he
died
he
was
only
four
years
of
his
long
life
had
been
spent
in
america
yet
he
left
his
stamp
upon
the
continent
far
more
than
any
other
man
of
his
time
he
was
the
greatest
most
of
all
the
colony
builders
as
he
said
himself
he
had
sailed
against
wind
and
tide
all
his
life
but
the
buffetings
of
fortune
left
him
sweet
and
true
to
the
end
chapter
how
benjamin
franklin
came
to
philadelphia
after
penn
left
his
colony
there
was
frequent
trouble
between
the
governors
and
the
people
some
of
the
governors
were
untrustworthy
some
were
weak
none
was
truly
great
but
about
ten
years
after
penn
death
a
truly
great
man
came
to
philadelphia
this
was
benjamin
franklin
of
all
the
men
of
colonial
times
franklin
was
the
greatest
benjamin
was
the
fifteenth
child
of
his
father
a
sturdy
english
nonconformist
who
some
years
before
had
emigrated
from
banbury
in
england
to
boston
in
america
as
the
family
was
so
large
the
children
had
to
begin
early
to
earn
their
own
living
so
at
the
age
of
ten
benjamin
was
apprenticed
to
his
own
father
who
was
a
tallow
chandler
and
the
little
chap
spent
his
days
helping
to
make
soap
and
dips
and
generally
making
himself
useful
but
he
did
not
like
it
at
all
so
after
a
time
he
was
apprenticed
to
his
elder
brother
james
who
had
a
printing
press
and
published
a
little
newspaper
called
the
courant
benjamin
liked
that
much
better
he
soon
became
a
good
printer
he
was
able
to
get
hold
of
books
easily
and
he
spent
his
spare
time
reading
such
books
as
the
pilgrim
progress
and
the
spectator
very
soon
too
he
took
to
writing
and
became
anxious
to
have
an
article
printed
in
his
brother
paper
but
as
he
was
only
a
boy
he
was
afraid
that
if
his
brother
knew
he
had
written
the
article
he
would
never
print
it
so
he
disguised
his
handwriting
and
slipped
his
paper
under
the
door
of
the
printing
house
at
night
it
was
found
next
morning
and
to
delight
was
thought
good
enough
to
be
printed
in
the
paper
after
that
benjamin
wrote
often
for
the
little
paper
in
time
however
he
and
his
brother
began
to
quarrel
and
when
he
was
seventeen
benjamin
decided
to
go
to
new
york
to
seek
his
fortune
there
he
took
ship
to
new
york
in
and
arrived
there
one
october
day
with
very
little
money
in
his
pocket
and
not
a
friend
in
the
town
he
did
not
find
work
in
new
york
but
an
old
printer
advised
him
to
go
to
philadelphia
where
he
knew
his
son
was
in
need
of
a
printer
benjamin
was
already
three
hundred
miles
from
home
and
philadelphia
was
another
hundred
miles
farther
but
he
resolved
to
go
fifty
miles
of
the
way
he
trudged
on
foot
the
rest
he
went
by
boat
and
after
nearly
a
week
of
most
uncomfortable
traveling
he
arrived
one
sunday
morning
at
philadelphia
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
dirty
and
untidy
hungry
and
tired
his
pockets
bulged
out
with
shirts
and
stockings
but
save
for
one
dutch
dollar
they
were
empty
of
money
benjamin
was
tired
and
dirty
but
before
everything
he
was
hungry
so
he
went
to
a
baker
shop
and
bought
three
big
rolls
as
his
pockets
were
full
he
tucked
two
of
the
rolls
under
his
arm
and
strolled
down
the
street
devouring
the
third
while
the
clean
tidy
folk
all
ready
to
go
to
meeting
stared
at
him
in
wonder
such
was
the
first
entry
of
one
of
america
greatest
statesmen
into
the
town
which
was
henceforth
to
be
his
home
and
where
he
was
to
become
famous
and
as
a
clever
frenchman
said
invent
the
republic
in
philadelphia
benjamin
found
work
and
although
after
a
year
he
left
his
new
home
and
sailed
for
england
he
soon
returned
in
ten
years
time
he
was
one
of
the
fore
most
men
of
philadelphia
and
took
an
interest
in
everything
which
concerned
the
life
of
the
people
he
established
a
circulating
library
he
was
chosen
clerk
of
the
general
assembly
he
was
appointed
postmaster
he
established
a
police
force
and
fire
brigade
and
helped
to
found
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
the
philadelphia
hospital
in
fact
he
took
an
interest
in
everything
connected
with
the
welfare
of
his
adopted
city
and
of
pennsylvania
and
when
troubles
arose
with
the
british
government
franklin
was
chosen
to
go
to
england
to
try
to
put
matters
right
later
on
other
colonies
too
asked
for
his
help
and
he
went
to
england
as
the
agent
not
only
of
pennsylvania
but
of
massachusetts
new
jersey
and
georgia
he
was
a
philosopher
and
scientist
as
well
as
a
diplomatist
and
he
was
the
first
american
whose
fame
spread
all
over
the
world
chapter
the
founding
of
north
and
south
carolina
it
was
in
the
part
of
the
united
states
which
we
now
call
north
carolina
you
remember
that
sir
walter
raleigh
tried
to
found
a
colony
that
colony
came
to
nothing
and
the
land
which
the
white
men
had
reclaimed
from
the
wilderness
returned
once
more
to
the
wilderness
nearly
a
hundred
years
went
past
before
white
men
again
appeared
in
that
part
of
the
country
in
king
charles
i
granted
all
this
region
to
sir
robert
heath
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
colonise
it
then
a
few
settlers
from
virginia
and
new
england
and
the
barbados
finding
the
land
vacant
and
neglected
settled
there
meanwhile
charles
ii
had
come
to
the
throne
and
wanting
to
reward
eight
of
his
friends
who
had
been
staunch
to
him
during
the
commonwealth
in
he
gave
them
all
the
land
between
latitude
and
and
from
sea
to
sea
if
you
look
on
the
map
you
will
see
that
this
takes
in
nearly
the
whole
of
the
southern
states
sir
robert
heath
was
by
this
time
dead
and
his
heirs
had
done
nothing
with
his
great
territory
in
america
but
as
soon
as
it
was
given
to
others
they
began
to
make
a
fuss
charles
ii
however
said
as
sir
robert
had
failed
to
plant
a
colony
his
claim
no
longer
held
good
so
the
eight
new
proprietors
took
possession
of
it
this
tract
of
land
had
already
been
named
carolina
by
the
frenchman
ribaut
in
honour
of
charles
ix
of
france
and
now
the
englishmen
who
took
possession
of
it
kept
the
old
name
in
honour
of
charles
ii
the
lords
proprietary
then
set
about
drawing
up
laws
for
their
new
country
after
an
old
english
title
they
called
the
oldest
among
them
the
palatine
palatine
originally
meant
a
person
who
held
some
office
about
a
king
palace
it
has
come
to
mean
one
who
has
royal
privileges
so
a
prince
palatine
is
really
a
little
king
when
the
palatine
died
it
was
arranged
that
the
next
in
age
should
take
his
place
as
to
the
other
seven
proprietors
they
all
had
grand
sounding
titles
such
as
chamberlain
chancellor
constable
high
steward
and
so
on
having
settled
all
these
grand
sounding
titles
the
proprietors
went
on
to
frame
a
system
of
laws
they
called
it
the
grand
model
or
fundamental
constitutions
but
it
was
more
like
some
old
english
feudal
system
than
anything
else
it
might
have
done
for
the
ancient
saxons
of
the
ninth
century
it
was
quite
unsuitable
for
rough
colonists
in
a
new
and
almost
uninhabited
country
it
was
quite
unsuited
for
men
who
had
left
europe
because
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
old
conventions
and
be
more
free
yet
the
lords
proprietors
said
that
the
grand
model
was
to
be
the
law
of
carolina
for
ever
and
ever
the
settlers
however
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
grand
model
for
it
was
altogether
too
fanciful
for
them
the
proprietors
on
their
side
persisted
but
when
they
found
it
impossible
to
force
the
settlers
to
obey
their
laws
they
changed
their
grand
model
and
tried
again
still
it
was
of
no
use
the
colonists
would
not
have
it
so
at
length
having
altered
their
unalterable
rules
five
times
they
gave
them
up
altogether
and
took
to
something
more
simple
but
among
much
that
was
foolish
and
unsuitable
in
the
grand
model
there
was
one
good
thing
that
was
that
every
one
was
free
to
worship
god
in
the
way
he
thought
right
if
only
seven
men
agreed
together
said
the
grand
model
they
were
enough
to
form
a
church
all
it
insisted
upon
was
that
people
must
acknowledge
a
god
and
that
they
must
worship
him
openly
nevertheless
in
spite
of
this
they
made
no
provision
for
worship
no
clergymen
went
with
the
settlers
and
indeed
for
many
years
no
clergymen
settled
among
them
but
because
there
was
religious
freedom
people
of
all
religions
came
to
carolina
quakers
and
dissenters
of
every
description
sought
a
refuge
there
they
came
not
only
from
england
but
from
the
other
colonies
and
from
foreign
countries
you
remember
that
the
protestants
of
france
were
called
huguenots
and
that
they
had
had
to
suffer
many
things
at
the
hands
of
catholic
rulers
until
the
good
king
henry
of
navarre
protected
them
by
the
edict
of
nantes
now
louis
xiv
who
was
at
this
time
on
the
throne
of
france
revoked
that
edict
he
forbade
the
huguenots
to
worship
god
in
their
own
way
and
he
also
forbade
them
to
leave
the
country
on
pain
of
death
but
thousands
braved
death
rather
than
remain
and
be
false
to
their
religion
some
were
caught
and
cruelly
punished
but
many
succeeded
in
escaping
to
holland
england
and
even
to
america
so
many
huguenots
now
settled
in
carolina
they
were
people
and
they
brought
a
sturdiness
and
grit
to
the
colony
which
it
might
otherwise
have
lacked
germans
too
came
from
the
palatinate
driven
thence
also
by
religious
persecutions
irish
presbyterians
came
fleeing
from
persecution
in
ulster
jacobites
who
having
fought
for
the
stuarts
found
scotland
no
longer
a
safe
came
seeking
a
new
home
these
were
all
hardy
industrious
people
but
besides
these
there
came
many
worthless
idlers
who
came
to
be
known
as
poor
whites
these
came
because
in
the
early
days
when
the
colony
was
but
sparsely
peopled
and
more
settlers
were
wanted
a
law
was
passed
that
a
new
settler
need
not
pay
any
debts
he
had
made
before
he
came
to
the
colony
and
for
a
year
after
he
came
he
need
pay
no
taxes
these
laws
of
course
brought
many
shiftless
folk
who
having
got
hopelessly
into
debt
somewhere
else
ran
away
to
carolina
to
get
free
of
it
indeed
so
many
of
these
undesirables
came
that
the
virginians
called
carolina
the
rogues
harbour
besides
all
these
white
people
there
were
a
great
many
negroes
especially
in
south
carolina
this
came
about
naturally
the
climate
of
carolina
is
hot
there
is
also
a
lot
of
marshy
ground
good
for
growing
rice
but
the
work
in
these
rice
fields
was
very
unhealthy
and
white
men
could
not
stand
it
for
long
so
a
trade
in
slaves
sprang
up
already
men
had
begun
to
kidnap
negroes
from
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
sell
them
to
the
tobacco
planters
of
virginia
in
those
days
no
one
saw
anything
wrong
in
it
and
now
that
the
rice
fields
of
south
carolina
constantly
required
more
workers
the
trade
in
slaves
increased
whole
shiploads
were
brought
at
a
time
they
were
bought
and
sold
like
cattle
and
if
they
died
at
their
unhealthy
work
it
mattered
little
for
they
were
cheap
and
there
were
plenty
more
where
they
came
from
chapter
war
with
the
indians
in
north
and
south
carolina
at
first
there
had
been
no
intention
of
making
two
provinces
of
carolina
but
the
country
was
so
large
and
the
settlements
made
so
far
apart
that
very
soon
it
became
divided
into
north
and
south
carolina
the
first
settlements
made
in
north
carolina
were
made
round
albemarle
sound
and
those
of
south
carolina
at
charleston
one
governor
was
supposed
to
rule
both
states
but
sometimes
each
had
a
governor
and
in
all
the
early
years
there
was
trouble
between
the
governors
and
the
people
sometimes
the
governors
were
good
men
but
more
often
they
were
rascals
who
cared
for
nothing
but
their
own
pockets
so
we
hear
of
revolutions
of
governors
being
deposed
and
imprisoned
of
colonists
going
to
england
to
complain
of
their
governors
of
governors
going
to
complain
of
the
colonists
but
far
worse
than
the
quarrel
between
people
and
governor
were
the
troubles
with
the
indians
many
thousands
of
white
people
had
by
this
time
settled
in
the
carolinas
and
the
redman
saw
himself
year
by
year
being
driven
further
and
further
from
his
old
hunting
grounds
so
year
by
year
his
anger
grew
at
first
he
had
been
friendly
to
the
white
man
because
he
brought
with
him
beads
and
copper
ornaments
and
fire
water
but
now
he
began
to
hate
him
at
length
the
indians
in
north
carolina
plotted
to
kill
all
the
white
people
many
tribes
of
indians
dwelt
round
the
settlements
but
the
chief
among
them
were
the
tuscaroras
these
tuscaroras
now
arranged
with
all
the
other
tribes
that
early
on
the
morning
before
the
new
moon
they
should
all
with
one
accord
tomahawk
and
firebrand
in
hand
fall
upon
the
and
wipe
them
utterly
from
the
face
of
the
earth
from
tribe
to
tribe
the
word
was
passed
till
hundreds
knew
the
secret
but
the
redman
is
silent
and
crafty
and
neither
by
sign
nor
word
did
he
betray
it
to
the
palefaces
suspecting
nothing
with
perfect
faith
in
their
friendship
the
white
people
allowed
the
indians
to
come
and
go
freely
in
their
settlements
then
one
night
in
a
great
many
appeared
asking
for
food
still
the
white
people
had
no
suspicion
of
evil
and
many
indians
were
allowed
even
to
spend
the
night
in
their
houses
the
slept
peacefully
but
for
the
redmen
there
was
little
rest
they
waited
impatiently
for
the
dawn
at
length
the
first
streaks
of
light
shivered
across
the
sky
and
from
the
woods
came
a
loud
fierce
war
whoop
it
was
answered
by
the
indians
within
the
settlements
and
with
tomahawk
in
one
hand
and
firebrand
in
the
other
they
fell
upon
the
still
sleeping
settlers
they
spared
neither
man
nor
woman
neither
the
old
nor
the
young
and
when
they
could
find
no
more
to
slay
they
set
fire
to
the
houses
then
those
who
had
hidden
themselves
were
forced
to
flee
from
the
flames
only
to
fall
beneath
the
tomahawk
the
swiss
and
germans
round
new
berne
and
the
huguenots
of
bath
were
the
chief
sufferers
but
the
wonder
is
that
any
white
men
escaped
for
their
cruel
work
at
an
end
and
the
settlements
nought
but
flaming
ruins
the
indians
marched
through
the
woods
seeking
any
who
had
escaped
gathering
at
length
to
a
spot
arranged
beforehand
here
they
drank
fire
water
rejoicing
savagely
over
their
victory
then
drunk
with
brandy
and
with
blood
they
staggered
forth
again
to
continue
their
horrible
labours
for
three
days
the
slaughter
lasted
for
three
days
the
forests
rang
with
terrifying
war
cries
and
village
after
village
was
laid
in
ashes
then
too
weary
and
too
drunk
for
further
effort
the
indians
ceased
their
awful
work
at
first
the
white
people
had
been
utterly
stunned
by
the
suddenness
and
horror
of
the
uprising
and
they
were
quite
incapable
of
suppressing
it
by
themselves
but
soon
help
came
both
from
south
carolina
and
virginia
friendly
indians
too
who
wished
to
prove
to
the
that
they
had
had
no
part
in
the
massacre
joined
the
forces
hundreds
of
the
indians
were
slain
in
battle
others
were
driven
from
fort
to
fort
but
not
for
two
years
were
they
thoroughly
subdued
then
at
length
finding
themselves
no
match
for
the
white
men
those
who
were
left
fled
from
the
province
and
joined
the
five
nations
in
new
york
making
from
this
time
forward
six
nations
in
south
carolina
too
there
was
war
with
the
indians
the
yamassees
had
been
among
the
indians
who
marched
from
south
carolina
to
fight
against
their
brothers
the
tuscaroras
yet
a
little
later
they
too
rose
against
the
several
causes
led
to
the
war
but
it
was
chiefly
brought
about
by
the
spaniards
who
had
a
settlement
at
augustine
to
the
south
of
carolina
they
hated
the
british
and
although
the
two
countries
were
now
at
peace
the
spaniards
did
all
they
could
to
injure
the
british
colonies
in
america
and
elsewhere
so
now
they
sympathised
with
the
yamassees
both
with
their
real
and
imaginary
grievances
and
encouraged
them
to
rise
against
the
british
secretly
and
silently
then
the
redmen
laid
their
plans
but
this
time
the
war
did
not
burst
forth
entirely
without
warning
for
when
the
redman
has
truly
given
his
faith
and
love
nothing
makes
him
false
now
there
was
a
chieftain
named
sanute
who
had
given
his
friendship
to
a
scotsman
named
fraser
and
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
his
friend
being
slaughtered
so
one
day
sanute
came
to
fraser
wife
to
warn
her
the
british
are
all
bad
he
said
they
will
all
go
to
an
evil
place
the
yamassees
also
will
go
there
if
they
allow
these
to
remain
longer
in
the
land
so
we
will
slay
them
all
we
only
wait
for
the
sign
of
a
bloody
stick
which
the
creeks
will
send
then
the
creeks
the
yamassees
and
many
other
nations
will
join
with
the
spaniards
to
slay
the
british
so
fly
in
all
haste
to
charleston
and
if
your
own
boat
is
not
large
enough
i
will
lend
you
my
canoe
fraser
was
very
much
frightened
when
she
heard
sanute
speak
like
this
but
when
she
told
her
husband
he
laughed
at
her
fears
the
idea
that
the
spaniards
should
join
with
the
indians
against
the
british
seemed
to
him
quite
absurd
how
can
the
spaniards
go
to
war
with
us
he
said
while
they
are
at
peace
with
great
britain
i
know
not
replied
sanute
but
the
spanish
governor
has
said
that
soon
there
will
be
a
great
war
between
the
british
and
the
spaniards
and
while
we
attack
on
land
he
will
send
great
ships
to
block
up
the
harbours
so
that
neither
man
nor
woman
may
escape
then
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
sanute
implored
his
white
friends
to
flee
with
all
haste
but
if
you
are
determined
to
stay
he
added
then
i
will
take
on
myself
one
last
office
of
friendship
and
so
that
you
may
not
be
tortured
i
will
slay
you
with
my
own
hand
still
fraser
doubted
but
his
wife
was
so
terrified
that
he
yielded
to
her
entreaties
and
gathering
his
goods
together
he
got
into
his
canoe
with
his
wife
and
child
and
paddled
away
to
charleston
unfortunately
in
the
hurry
of
departure
fraser
either
forgot
to
warn
his
friends
in
the
plantation
near
him
or
they
being
warned
disregarded
it
and
a
few
days
later
the
slaughter
began
at
daybreak
the
signal
was
given
and
at
the
sound
of
the
war
whoop
the
seemingly
peaceful
indians
were
turned
suddenly
into
raging
demons
who
with
tomahawk
and
torch
in
hand
sowed
destruction
and
death
around
so
the
land
was
filled
with
blood
and
wailing
pleasant
homesteads
were
laid
in
ruins
and
only
heaps
of
smouldering
ashes
marked
where
they
had
been
but
governor
craven
was
one
of
the
best
governors
of
his
time
he
was
a
man
of
action
and
courage
as
well
as
a
wise
ruler
and
he
quickly
gathered
an
army
with
which
to
march
against
the
savages
the
north
carolinians
too
remembering
gratefully
the
help
which
south
carolina
had
given
to
them
in
their
need
sent
men
soon
the
yamassees
and
their
friends
were
defeated
and
driven
from
the
province
they
fled
across
the
border
and
took
refuge
in
spanish
territory
where
they
were
received
with
great
rejoicing
they
might
indeed
have
been
heroes
returning
from
a
victorious
campaign
for
the
church
bells
were
rung
and
salutes
were
fired
in
their
honour
the
yamassees
were
crushed
but
they
were
not
utterly
conquered
from
henceforth
their
hearts
were
filled
with
hatred
against
all
the
carolinians
this
hatred
the
spaniards
did
their
best
to
keep
alive
they
supplied
the
indians
with
weapons
and
made
them
valiant
with
fire
water
thus
encouraged
they
broke
across
the
borders
in
small
scalping
parties
seizing
and
slaying
often
with
unspeakable
tortures
all
those
who
dwelt
in
lonely
places
these
frays
were
so
unceasing
and
so
deadly
that
at
length
hardly
any
one
dared
live
in
all
the
border
region
meanwhile
the
war
against
the
indians
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
as
the
lords
proprietor
made
a
good
deal
of
money
out
of
the
colony
the
settlers
thought
they
might
as
well
bear
some
of
the
expense
also
so
they
sent
messengers
home
to
arrange
this
matter
but
the
lords
proprietor
seemed
to
care
little
about
their
possessions
except
as
a
means
of
making
money
and
they
refused
to
pay
any
of
the
cost
of
the
war
this
made
the
settlers
angry
the
settlers
revolt
and
carolina
becomes
a
royal
province
they
had
never
liked
the
rule
of
the
lords
proprietor
now
they
were
heartily
tired
of
it
and
they
refused
to
stand
it
longer
king
william
iii
was
now
upon
the
throne
and
the
settlers
asked
him
to
make
south
carolina
a
crown
colony
to
this
king
william
agreed
ten
years
later
north
carolina
also
became
a
crown
colony
and
the
two
carolinas
from
henceforth
continued
to
be
separate
states
chapter
the
founding
of
georgia
south
carolina
extended
as
far
as
the
river
savannah
and
between
that
river
and
the
spanish
settlement
at
augustine
there
stretched
a
great
waste
of
country
inhabited
only
by
the
redmen
who
ever
and
anon
made
raids
into
carolina
southward
from
this
the
spaniards
claimed
the
land
and
called
it
florida
but
they
made
no
effort
to
colonise
the
wilderness
which
stretched
between
florida
and
the
borders
of
south
carolina
so
at
length
the
idea
of
founding
a
british
colony
there
occurred
to
an
englishman
named
james
oglethorpe
he
was
a
truly
great
man
and
in
an
age
when
men
were
cruel
to
each
other
out
of
mere
thoughtlessness
he
tried
to
make
people
kinder
to
their
fellows
in
those
days
in
england
people
could
be
imprisoned
for
debt
and
if
they
could
not
pay
they
remained
in
prison
often
for
years
and
sometimes
till
they
died
they
were
starved
and
tortured
loaded
with
fetters
locked
up
in
filthy
dungeons
herded
together
with
thieves
and
murderers
or
those
suffering
from
smallpox
and
other
loathsome
diseases
it
was
horrible
but
no
one
troubled
about
it
there
had
always
been
misery
in
the
world
there
always
would
be
men
thought
and
no
one
had
pity
for
prisoners
but
now
young
oglethorpe
had
a
friend
who
was
imprisoned
for
debt
and
being
treated
in
this
horrible
fashion
he
died
of
smallpox
oglethorpe
generous
heart
was
grieved
at
the
death
of
his
friend
and
he
began
to
enquire
into
the
causes
of
it
the
things
he
discovered
were
so
awful
that
he
stood
aghast
with
horror
at
the
misery
of
the
imprisoned
debtors
and
what
was
more
he
did
not
rest
until
he
had
made
other
people
see
the
horror
of
it
also
soon
there
was
an
outcry
all
over
england
and
some
of
the
worst
evils
were
done
away
with
then
the
idea
came
to
oglethorpe
that
he
would
found
a
colony
in
america
where
poor
debtors
who
had
regained
their
freedom
might
find
a
refuge
and
make
a
new
start
in
life
he
decided
to
found
this
colony
to
the
south
of
south
carolina
so
that
it
might
not
only
be
a
refuge
for
the
oppressed
but
also
form
a
buffer
state
between
the
carolinas
and
spanish
florida
so
from
george
ii
oglethorpe
got
a
charter
for
the
land
lying
between
the
savannah
and
the
altamaha
rivers
and
in
honour
of
the
king
the
colony
was
called
georgia
many
people
were
by
this
time
interested
in
his
scheme
they
gave
him
money
for
it
and
he
also
got
a
large
grant
from
parliament
this
was
the
first
time
that
parliament
ever
voted
money
to
found
a
colony
in
america
of
all
the
thirteen
colonies
now
founded
georgia
alone
received
aid
from
the
state
trustees
were
appointed
to
frame
the
laws
and
a
kind
of
proprietory
government
was
created
the
colonists
were
to
be
granted
all
the
liberties
of
englishmen
but
they
were
not
to
be
allowed
to
frame
the
laws
or
take
any
part
in
the
government
after
years
the
rule
of
the
trustees
was
to
come
to
an
end
and
georgia
was
to
become
a
crown
colony
all
these
matters
being
arranged
men
were
sent
round
to
visit
the
jails
and
choose
from
among
the
prisoners
those
who
were
really
good
men
and
who
through
misfortune
rather
than
roguery
found
themselves
in
prison
the
commissioners
refused
to
take
lazy
or
bad
men
or
those
who
in
going
to
georgia
would
leave
wife
or
children
in
want
at
home
besides
poor
debtors
those
who
were
being
persecuted
because
of
their
religion
in
any
european
state
were
invited
to
come
and
find
a
refuge
in
georgia
no
slavery
was
to
be
allowed
and
the
sale
of
rum
was
forbidden
throughout
the
whole
colony
for
oglethorpe
knew
how
the
redman
loved
and
how
bad
it
was
for
him
and
he
wanted
the
settlement
of
georgia
to
be
a
blessing
and
not
a
curse
to
the
redman
as
well
as
to
the
white
man
soon
far
more
people
wanted
to
go
than
oglethorpe
could
take
so
crowds
of
poor
wretches
had
to
be
turned
away
bitterly
disappointed
that
they
could
not
go
to
this
new
land
which
after
their
terrible
sufferings
seemed
to
them
a
very
paradise
the
preparations
took
some
time
and
it
was
about
the
middle
of
november
when
at
length
the
anne
hoisted
her
sails
and
turned
her
prow
towards
the
west
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
colonists
on
board
with
oglethorpe
as
governor
and
it
was
nearly
the
end
of
january
when
the
colonists
landed
on
the
southern
shores
of
the
savannah
and
founded
the
town
of
the
same
name
one
of
the
first
things
oglethorpe
did
was
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
indians
for
he
knew
how
greatly
the
peace
and
safety
of
the
little
colony
depended
on
their
friendship
there
were
eight
tribes
of
creeks
who
claimed
the
land
upon
which
oglethorpe
had
settled
but
before
he
allowed
the
colonists
to
land
he
himself
went
ashore
and
sought
out
the
chieftain
whose
village
was
close
to
the
spot
he
had
chosen
for
his
town
this
chieftain
was
an
old
man
of
over
ninety
years
and
at
first
he
did
not
seem
at
all
pleased
at
the
idea
of
white
men
settling
on
his
land
but
oglethorpe
was
kindly
and
friendly
he
spoke
gently
to
the
old
chief
and
soon
won
his
consent
to
the
settlement
and
a
promise
of
friendship
when
then
the
colonists
landed
instead
of
being
greeted
with
a
flight
of
arrows
they
were
received
with
solemn
ceremony
the
braves
coming
down
to
the
water
edge
to
greet
them
first
came
the
medicine
man
carrying
in
either
hand
a
fan
made
of
white
feathers
as
signs
of
peace
and
friendship
behind
him
followed
the
chieftain
and
his
squaw
with
twenty
or
thirty
braves
who
filled
the
air
with
wild
yells
of
welcome
when
the
medicine
man
reached
oglethorpe
he
paused
and
dancing
round
him
he
swept
him
on
every
side
with
the
white
feather
fans
chanting
the
while
a
tale
of
brave
deeds
this
done
the
chieftain
next
drew
near
and
in
flowery
words
bade
the
white
chief
and
his
followers
welcome
thus
peacefully
the
settlement
was
begun
but
oglethorpe
wanted
to
be
friends
with
the
other
tribes
round
so
he
asked
the
old
chieftain
to
invite
them
to
a
conference
and
a
few
months
later
they
all
came
oglethorpe
received
them
in
one
of
the
new
houses
built
by
the
settlers
and
when
they
were
all
solemnly
seated
an
old
and
very
tall
man
stood
up
and
made
a
long
speech
he
claimed
for
the
creeks
all
the
land
south
of
the
savannah
we
are
poor
and
ignorant
he
said
but
the
great
spirit
who
gave
the
breath
gave
the
redmen
breath
also
but
the
great
spirit
who
made
us
both
has
given
more
wisdom
to
the
then
he
spread
his
arms
abroad
and
lengthened
the
sound
of
his
words
so
we
feel
sure
he
cried
that
the
great
spirit
who
lives
in
heaven
and
all
around
has
sent
you
to
teach
us
and
our
wives
and
children
therefore
we
give
you
freely
the
land
we
do
not
use
that
is
my
thought
and
not
mine
alone
but
the
thought
of
all
the
eight
nations
of
the
creeks
and
in
token
thereof
we
bring
you
gifts
of
skins
which
is
our
wealth
then
one
by
one
the
chief
men
of
each
nation
rose
up
and
laid
a
bundle
of
buck
skins
at
oglethorpe
feet
in
return
oglethorpe
gave
each
of
the
chiefs
a
coat
and
hat
trimmed
with
gold
lace
each
of
the
braves
likewise
received
some
present
so
a
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
the
redmen
promising
to
keep
the
good
talk
in
their
hearts
as
long
as
the
sun
shone
or
water
ran
in
the
rivers
and
so
just
and
wise
was
oglethorpe
in
all
his
dealings
with
the
natives
that
in
the
early
days
of
the
settlement
there
were
no
wars
with
the
natives
oglethorpe
worked
unceasingly
for
the
good
of
the
colony
he
kept
no
state
but
slept
in
a
tent
and
ate
the
plainest
of
food
his
every
thought
being
given
to
the
happiness
of
his
people
and
in
return
they
loved
him
and
called
him
father
if
any
one
were
sick
he
visited
him
and
when
they
quarreled
they
came
to
him
to
settle
their
disputes
yet
he
kept
strict
discipline
and
allowed
neither
drinking
nor
swearing
the
work
of
the
colony
went
on
apace
about
six
weeks
after
the
settlers
landed
some
of
the
settlers
from
charleston
came
to
visit
oglethorpe
and
they
were
astonished
to
find
how
quickly
things
had
got
on
it
is
surprising
one
wrote
to
see
how
cheerfully
the
men
work
considering
they
have
not
been
bred
to
it
there
are
no
idlers
there
even
the
boys
and
girls
do
their
parts
there
are
four
houses
already
up
but
none
finished
he
has
ploughed
up
some
land
part
of
which
he
has
sowed
with
wheat
he
has
two
or
three
gardens
which
he
has
sowed
with
divers
sort
of
seeds
he
was
palisading
the
town
round
in
short
he
has
done
a
vast
deal
of
work
for
the
time
and
i
think
his
name
justly
deserves
to
be
immortalised
but
if
georgia
had
peace
with
the
indians
it
was
far
otherwise
with
the
spaniards
for
the
spaniards
were
very
angry
with
the
british
for
daring
to
settle
south
of
the
savannah
they
vowed
to
root
them
out
of
america
and
they
set
out
to
attack
the
little
colony
but
oglethorpe
was
a
daring
soldier
as
well
as
a
wise
statesman
and
he
succeeded
in
beating
the
spaniards
it
was
at
frederica
where
the
greatest
battle
took
place
this
town
had
been
founded
after
savannah
and
named
frederica
in
honour
of
frederick
prince
of
wales
it
was
built
on
an
island
off
the
coast
called
simon
and
being
near
the
spanish
border
it
was
well
fortified
at
the
little
village
of
simon
which
was
at
the
south
end
of
the
island
there
were
barricades
and
a
high
where
a
constant
watch
was
kept
for
ships
as
soon
as
they
were
sighted
a
gun
was
fired
and
a
horseman
sped
off
to
the
barracks
with
the
news
they
attack
the
settlements
here
one
day
in
july
a
great
fleet
of
spanish
vessels
came
sailing
they
made
a
brave
show
with
their
high
painted
prows
and
shining
sails
and
they
brought
five
thousand
men
who
vowed
to
give
no
quarter
oglethorpe
had
but
eight
hundred
men
some
were
regular
soldiers
some
were
fierce
highlanders
glad
to
have
a
chance
of
a
shot
at
the
spaniards
and
not
a
few
were
friendly
indians
but
small
though
his
force
was
oglethorpe
did
not
despair
he
had
sent
to
carolina
for
help
which
he
was
sure
would
come
if
he
could
but
hold
out
for
a
few
days
he
thought
however
that
the
position
at
simon
was
too
dangerous
so
he
spiked
his
guns
destroyed
all
stores
and
retreated
to
frederica
the
spaniards
soon
landed
and
taking
possession
of
simon
set
out
to
attack
frederica
but
they
found
it
no
easy
matter
for
the
town
was
surrounded
by
dense
and
pathless
woods
and
struggling
through
them
the
spaniards
stumbled
into
marshes
or
got
entangled
in
the
dense
undergrowth
until
in
their
weariness
they
declared
that
not
the
evil
one
himself
could
force
a
passage
through
added
to
their
other
difficulties
they
were
constantly
harassed
by
scouting
parties
of
wild
indians
and
almost
as
wild
highlanders
sent
out
from
frederica
by
oglethorpe
but
meanwhile
no
help
appeared
and
at
length
oglethorpe
having
discovered
that
the
spanish
force
was
divided
decided
to
make
a
sortie
and
surprise
one
part
of
it
so
with
three
hundred
chosen
men
he
marched
out
one
dark
night
and
stole
silently
through
the
woods
until
he
had
almost
reached
the
enemy
camp
then
suddenly
a
frenchman
who
was
with
the
little
british
force
discharged
his
musket
and
fled
towards
the
spanish
camp
all
hope
of
a
surprise
was
at
an
end
and
oglethorpe
returned
hastily
to
the
fort
but
that
the
surprise
had
failed
was
not
the
worst
it
was
certain
that
the
deserter
would
tell
the
spaniards
how
weak
the
british
were
and
that
thus
heartened
they
would
soon
attack
in
force
something
oglethorpe
decided
must
be
done
to
prevent
that
so
he
wrote
a
letter
in
french
addressing
it
to
the
french
deserter
this
letter
was
written
as
if
coming
from
a
friend
it
begged
the
frenchman
to
tell
the
spaniards
that
frederica
was
in
an
utterly
defenseless
state
and
to
bring
them
on
to
an
attack
or
if
he
could
not
persuade
them
to
attack
at
least
he
must
persuade
them
to
remain
three
days
longer
at
fort
simon
for
within
that
time
two
thousand
men
would
arrive
from
carolina
and
six
british
ships
of
war
which
he
doubted
not
would
be
able
to
give
a
good
account
of
themselves
to
the
spanish
invaders
above
all
things
the
writer
bade
the
frenchman
beware
of
saying
anything
about
admiral
vernon
the
british
admiral
who
was
coming
against
augustine
he
ended
by
assuring
him
that
the
british
king
would
not
forget
such
good
services
and
that
he
should
be
richly
rewarded
this
letter
oglethorpe
gave
to
one
of
the
spanish
prisoners
they
had
taken
who
for
a
small
sum
of
money
and
his
liberty
promised
to
deliver
it
to
the
french
deserter
but
instead
of
doing
that
he
gave
it
as
oglethorpe
had
expected
he
would
to
the
leader
of
the
spanish
army
the
french
deserter
at
once
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
letter
or
its
writer
but
all
the
same
he
was
fettered
and
kept
a
prisoner
while
the
spanish
leaders
held
a
council
of
war
they
knew
not
what
to
do
some
thought
that
the
letter
was
a
ruse
as
indeed
it
was
merely
meant
to
deceive
them
but
others
thought
that
the
british
really
had
them
in
a
trap
and
while
they
were
thus
debating
by
good
luck
some
british
vessels
appeared
off
the
coast
and
thinking
them
to
be
the
mentioned
in
the
letter
the
spaniards
fled
in
such
haste
that
although
they
had
time
to
set
fire
to
the
barracks
at
simon
they
left
behind
them
a
great
cannon
and
large
stores
of
food
and
ammunition
thus
was
the
little
colony
saved
from
destruction
by
his
brave
stand
and
clever
ruse
oglethorpe
had
saved
not
only
georgia
but
carolina
too
yet
south
carolina
had
cause
for
shame
for
her
governor
had
paid
no
heed
to
oglethorpe
call
for
help
and
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
georgia
might
have
been
wiped
out
he
indeed
cared
so
little
about
it
that
when
the
governors
of
the
other
more
northerly
colonies
wrote
to
oglethorpe
thanking
and
praising
him
he
did
not
join
with
them
but
much
to
his
disgust
seeing
their
governor
so
lax
some
of
the
people
of
south
carolina
themselves
wrote
to
oglethorpe
to
thank
him
it
was
very
certain
they
wrote
had
the
spaniards
succeeded
in
those
attempts
against
your
excellency
they
would
also
have
entirely
destroyed
us
laid
our
province
waste
and
desolate
and
filled
our
habitation
with
waste
and
slaughter
we
are
very
sensible
of
the
great
protection
and
safety
we
have
long
enjoyed
by
your
excellency
being
to
the
southwards
of
us
and
keeping
your
armed
sloops
cruising
on
the
coasts
which
has
secured
our
trade
and
fortunes
more
than
all
the
ships
of
war
ever
stationed
at
charleston
but
more
by
your
late
resolution
against
the
spaniards
when
nothing
could
have
saved
us
from
utter
ruin
next
to
the
providence
of
almighty
god
but
your
excellency
singular
conduct
and
the
bravery
of
the
troops
under
your
command
we
think
it
our
duty
to
pray
god
to
protect
your
excellency
and
send
you
success
in
all
your
undertakings
but
although
oglethorpe
had
many
friends
he
had
also
enemies
some
even
within
the
colony
he
had
done
so
much
to
serve
there
were
those
within
the
colony
who
wanted
rum
and
wanted
slavery
and
said
that
it
would
never
prosper
until
they
were
allowed
oglethorpe
with
all
his
might
opposed
them
so
they
hated
him
others
were
discontented
for
far
better
reasons
because
they
had
no
share
in
the
government
and
because
the
land
laws
were
bad
oglethorpe
too
had
his
own
troubles
for
he
had
spent
so
much
on
the
colony
that
he
was
deeply
in
debt
so
having
ruled
for
twelve
years
he
went
home
and
although
be
lived
to
a
great
old
age
he
never
returned
again
to
georgia
at
the
age
of
he
married
then
he
settled
down
to
the
quiet
life
of
an
english
gentleman
learned
men
and
fine
ladies
called
him
friend
poets
sang
of
his
deeds
and
the
great
samuel
johnson
wanted
to
write
his
life
heroic
romantic
and
full
of
the
old
gallantry
to
the
end
he
lived
out
his
last
days
in
the
great
manor
house
of
an
english
village
and
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
peaceful
village
church
in
but
the
savannah
repeats
to
the
altamaha
the
story
of
his
virtues
and
of
his
valor
and
the
atlantic
publishes
to
the
mountains
the
greatness
of
his
fame
for
all
georgia
is
his
living
speaking
monument
oglethorpe
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
founders
of
british
colonies
in
america
who
lived
to
see
their
separation
from
the
but
long
ere
that
he
had
to
see
many
changes
in
the
settlement
for
the
colonists
would
not
be
contented
without
rum
and
slaves
and
in
both
were
allowed
a
few
years
later
the
trustees
gave
up
their
claims
and
georgia
became
a
crown
colony
and
the
people
were
given
the
right
to
vote
and
help
to
frame
the
laws
under
which
they
had
to
live
part
v
stories
of
the
french
in
america
chapter
how
the
mississippi
was
discovered
while
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
from
nova
scotia
to
georgia
were
being
claimed
and
peopled
by
the
british
another
and
very
different
nation
laid
claim
also
to
the
mighty
continent
before
jamestown
was
founded
the
french
had
already
set
foot
upon
the
lawrence
long
before
the
pilgrim
fathers
sailed
from
plymouth
the
flag
of
france
was
floating
from
the
citadel
of
quebec
and
the
french
laid
claim
to
the
whole
of
canada
but
the
french
and
the
british
claimed
these
new
lands
in
very
different
ways
the
englishmen
came
seeking
freedom
and
a
new
home
the
frenchmen
came
seeking
adventure
the
englishman
painfully
felled
trees
and
cleared
land
toiling
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
for
the
comfort
of
a
home
the
frenchman
set
up
crosses
on
the
edge
of
pathless
forests
claiming
unknown
lands
for
god
and
his
king
he
came
as
missionary
trader
and
adventurer
rather
than
as
farmer
and
led
on
by
zeal
for
religion
or
desire
for
adventure
he
pushed
his
settlements
far
into
the
wilderness
so
long
years
went
by
all
along
the
atlantic
coasts
spread
fertile
fields
and
fair
homesteads
the
british
were
content
to
live
on
the
lands
which
they
had
cleared
and
tilled
and
no
adventurer
sought
to
know
what
lay
beyond
the
blue
mountain
range
which
shut
him
from
the
west
far
otherwise
was
it
with
the
french
priests
and
traders
were
both
full
of
a
desire
for
conquest
and
adventure
many
of
them
indeed
were
so
driven
by
the
roving
spirit
that
they
left
the
towns
altogether
and
lived
alone
among
the
forests
tracking
the
wild
animals
and
only
coming
to
towns
to
sell
the
skins
and
get
provisions
these
trappers
brought
back
with
them
many
strange
tales
of
the
forests
and
unknown
wilds
they
spoke
of
the
mississippi
or
great
water
of
which
the
indians
told
marvelous
tales
and
at
length
it
seemed
to
their
hearers
that
this
great
water
could
be
no
other
than
the
long
sought
passage
to
india
and
the
east
many
people
fired
by
these
tales
went
in
search
of
this
great
water
in
two
priests
named
marquette
and
joliet
were
the
first
to
discover
it
for
many
miles
they
floated
down
the
mississippi
on
either
side
stretched
endless
forests
and
plains
of
waving
grass
haunts
of
wild
animals
and
of
the
indians
almost
as
wild
on
they
went
past
the
mouth
of
the
yellow
missouri
on
still
till
they
came
to
the
river
arkansas
at
last
sure
that
the
great
river
went
southward
and
not
westward
as
they
had
supposed
they
decided
to
return
it
had
been
easy
enough
floating
down
but
now
they
had
to
battle
against
the
stream
and
it
was
only
after
weeks
of
toil
that
they
at
length
reached
canada
again
with
their
news
when
he
heard
their
story
another
adventurer
named
rené
robert
cavelier
sieur
de
la
salle
became
eager
to
make
certain
of
their
discovery
and
follow
the
river
all
the
way
to
its
mouth
with
great
care
and
trouble
he
made
his
arrangements
he
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
compass
so
great
a
journey
by
canoes
so
he
built
a
little
ship
which
he
called
the
griffin
it
was
the
first
ship
which
had
been
seen
by
the
indians
round
lake
erie
and
in
amazement
and
fear
they
came
to
stare
at
it
in
their
ignorant
terror
they
would
have
destroyed
it
had
not
careful
watch
been
kept
from
the
very
beginning
of
his
expedition
la
salle
found
many
difficulties
but
at
length
they
all
seemed
to
be
overcome
and
he
set
out
with
his
friend
henri
de
tonty
and
about
forty
men
tonty
was
a
man
of
courage
as
bold
and
enterprising
as
la
salle
himself
he
was
too
much
feared
by
the
indians
who
thought
him
a
great
medicine
man
for
while
fighting
in
europe
he
had
had
one
hand
shot
off
but
he
had
replaced
it
with
an
iron
hand
which
he
always
wore
covered
with
a
glove
the
indians
did
not
know
this
and
once
or
twice
when
they
had
been
troublesome
he
had
brought
them
to
order
by
knocking
them
down
with
this
hand
not
knowing
the
secret
of
it
they
marvelled
greatly
at
his
strength
and
fearing
him
accordingly
called
him
iron
hand
one
of
la
salle
great
difficulties
was
lack
of
money
so
before
leaving
the
great
lakes
he
collected
a
quantity
of
furs
then
he
sent
back
the
griffin
and
half
his
men
with
orders
to
sell
these
furs
and
return
with
supplies
for
the
expedition
as
quickly
as
possible
with
the
rest
of
his
men
la
salle
journeyed
on
to
the
head
of
lake
michigan
in
canoes
it
was
no
easy
journey
for
storms
swept
the
lake
the
waves
tossed
their
frail
canoes
hither
and
thither
so
that
they
were
often
in
danger
of
drowning
they
were
harassed
too
by
unfriendly
indians
at
length
worn
out
by
fatigue
starving
with
cold
and
hunger
they
reached
the
appointed
place
to
await
the
return
of
the
griffin
but
the
griffin
never
came
in
vain
la
salle
scanned
the
grey
waters
day
after
day
passed
and
no
white
sail
flecked
the
dreary
expanse
the
griffin
was
never
heard
of
more
with
a
heavy
heart
la
salle
at
length
gave
up
the
weary
watch
and
decided
to
go
on
with
such
men
and
supplies
as
he
had
but
with
every
step
fresh
difficulties
arose
la
salle
had
many
enemies
and
they
did
their
best
to
hinder
and
hamper
him
his
own
men
were
discontented
and
mutinous
they
had
no
love
for
their
leader
no
enthusiasm
for
the
expedition
and
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
the
way
made
them
sullen
they
were
half
starved
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
all
they
wanted
was
to
get
back
to
a
comfortable
life
they
were
sick
of
the
wilderness
and
its
hardships
added
to
this
the
indians
told
them
bloodcurdling
tales
of
the
terrors
of
the
father
of
waters
it
was
a
raging
torrent
of
whirlpools
they
said
full
of
poisonous
serpents
and
loathly
monsters
those
who
ventured
on
it
would
never
return
this
was
more
than
the
men
could
face
they
chose
rather
the
possibility
of
death
among
the
indians
and
the
wilderness
to
its
certainty
among
such
horrors
and
some
of
them
ran
away
depressed
by
this
desertion
la
salle
resolved
to
camp
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
so
on
the
banks
of
the
river
illinois
he
built
a
fort
which
he
called
or
but
la
salle
brave
heart
was
not
yet
broken
and
here
he
began
to
build
a
new
ship
in
which
to
sail
down
the
mississippi
there
was
wood
in
plenty
around
and
the
work
was
begun
but
many
things
such
as
sails
and
rigging
which
were
necessary
for
the
ship
the
wilderness
could
not
supply
and
seeing
no
other
way
la
salle
resolved
to
go
back
to
fort
frontenac
to
get
them
leaving
tonty
meanwhile
to
look
after
the
building
of
the
ship
it
was
march
when
la
salle
set
out
on
his
tremendous
walk
of
a
thousand
miles
with
him
he
took
a
faithful
indians
guide
and
four
frenchmen
and
seldom
have
men
endured
a
journey
more
terrible
the
spring
sun
was
just
beginning
to
thaw
the
ice
and
snow
of
winter
so
that
the
prairies
were
turned
to
marshes
into
which
the
travelers
sank
knee
deep
the
forests
were
pathless
thickets
through
which
they
had
to
force
a
way
with
axe
and
hatchet
as
a
pathway
the
rivers
were
useless
to
them
for
the
ice
was
so
thin
that
it
would
not
bear
their
weight
and
later
when
it
thawed
and
broke
up
they
still
could
not
use
their
canoes
lest
they
should
be
shattered
by
the
floating
masses
of
ice
all
day
long
they
toiled
knee
deep
in
mud
and
snow
laden
with
baggage
guns
and
ammunition
at
night
they
lay
down
without
shelter
of
any
kind
they
were
often
hungry
they
suffered
constantly
both
from
cold
and
heat
for
at
noon
the
sun
beat
down
upon
them
fiercely
and
at
night
the
frost
was
so
bitter
that
the
blankets
in
which
they
lay
wrapped
were
frozen
stiff
the
hardships
of
the
journey
were
so
tremendous
that
the
marvel
is
that
any
one
lived
to
tell
of
them
indeed
one
by
one
the
men
fell
ill
and
when
at
length
after
three
months
of
pain
and
peril
they
arrived
at
their
journey
end
only
la
salle
had
strength
or
courage
left
here
more
bad
news
greeted
la
salle
for
he
now
heard
that
a
ship
sent
out
from
france
laden
with
supplies
for
him
had
been
wrecked
but
even
this
cruel
stroke
of
fortune
could
not
break
his
spirit
once
more
he
set
about
gathering
supplies
and
made
ready
to
return
to
fort
but
worse
was
yet
to
come
la
salle
was
about
to
start
when
he
received
a
letter
from
tonty
from
this
he
learned
that
soon
after
he
had
left
nearly
all
his
men
had
mutinied
they
had
rifled
the
stores
and
demolished
the
fort
then
throwing
into
the
river
everything
they
could
not
carry
had
made
off
only
three
or
four
had
remained
faithful
with
these
tony
was
now
alone
in
the
wilderness
this
staggering
news
only
made
la
salle
more
eager
to
set
out
for
he
could
not
leave
his
brave
friend
thus
helpless
so
once
more
the
toilsome
journey
was
begun
but
when
was
reached
la
salle
found
no
friend
to
welcome
him
all
around
there
was
nothing
but
silence
and
desolation
and
ghastly
ruins
the
unfinished
ship
like
some
vast
skeleton
huge
and
gaunt
alone
bore
witness
that
white
men
had
once
been
there
still
la
salle
would
not
despair
he
spent
the
winter
making
friends
with
the
indians
and
searching
earnestly
for
some
trace
of
tonty
the
winter
was
unusually
severe
the
whole
land
was
covered
with
snow
and
both
la
salle
and
some
of
his
men
became
for
days
but
at
last
with
the
melting
of
the
snows
light
and
joy
came
to
him
the
blindness
passed
tonty
was
found
once
again
the
friends
met
each
had
a
tale
to
tell
a
tale
of
bitter
disappointments
and
defeats
yet
in
spite
of
all
the
blows
of
fortune
le
salle
would
not
give
in
once
more
he
set
about
making
preparations
for
the
expedition
but
now
he
gave
up
the
idea
of
building
a
ship
and
decided
to
trust
to
canoes
alone
it
was
when
all
was
ready
the
rivers
were
frozen
hard
so
placing
their
canoes
on
sledges
the
men
dragged
them
over
the
ice
as
they
went
southward
and
spring
came
on
the
ice
melted
and
would
no
longer
bear
them
the
stream
was
soon
filled
with
floating
masses
of
broken
ice
so
they
were
obliged
to
land
and
wait
until
it
had
melted
then
once
more
they
set
out
every
day
now
they
drifted
farther
and
farther
into
the
heat
of
summer
the
sun
shone
softly
through
the
overhanging
trees
the
river
banks
were
gay
with
flowers
and
bright
plumaged
birds
flashed
through
the
sunlight
after
the
tortures
of
the
past
winters
this
green
and
fertile
land
seemed
a
very
paradise
so
on
the
adventurers
passed
where
never
white
man
had
passed
before
and
at
length
they
reached
the
mouth
of
the
mighty
river
and
stood
upon
the
shore
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
here
in
while
wondering
savages
looked
on
this
mere
handful
of
white
men
claimed
all
the
land
through
which
they
had
passed
for
their
king
the
long
silence
of
the
wilderness
was
awakened
for
the
first
time
by
the
sound
of
latin
chants
guns
were
fired
and
to
the
shouts
of
god
save
the
king
a
pillar
was
set
up
chapter
king
william
war
and
queen
anne
war
at
this
time
in
europe
france
and
britain
were
at
war
when
king
william
came
to
take
possession
of
britain
james
ii
ran
away
to
france
the
king
of
france
received
him
kindly
and
soon
declared
war
upon
william
the
war
was
fought
not
only
in
europe
but
in
america
also
and
it
is
known
in
america
as
king
william
war
because
william
was
king
of
great
britain
at
the
time
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
fierce
struggle
between
british
and
french
for
possession
of
the
vast
continent
of
america
a
struggle
which
was
to
last
for
seventy
years
a
struggle
in
which
not
only
the
white
people
but
the
indians
also
took
part
some
fighting
for
the
british
some
for
the
french
king
william
war
at
this
time
frontenac
was
governor
of
canada
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
nobles
of
france
and
lived
surrounded
with
state
and
splendour
proud
and
haughty
and
of
a
fiery
temper
with
white
men
he
quarreled
often
but
he
knew
better
than
any
other
how
to
manage
the
indians
and
they
feared
him
as
they
feared
no
white
ruler
who
came
before
or
after
him
he
would
not
allow
the
chiefs
to
call
him
brother
as
other
governors
had
done
they
were
his
children
to
them
he
was
the
great
father
yet
if
need
be
he
would
paint
his
face
dress
himself
in
indian
clothes
and
tomahawk
in
his
hand
lead
the
war
dance
yelling
and
leaping
with
the
best
of
them
king
louis
now
gave
frontenac
orders
to
seize
new
york
so
that
the
french
might
have
access
to
the
hudson
river
and
a
port
open
all
the
year
round
and
not
frozen
up
for
months
at
a
time
like
quebec
so
frontenac
made
ready
his
forces
he
gathered
three
armies
and
sent
them
by
different
ways
to
attack
the
british
but
few
of
these
forces
were
regular
soldiers
many
of
them
were
indians
still
more
were
coureurs
de
bois
wild
who
dressed
and
lived
more
like
indians
than
white
men
and
were
as
fearless
and
lawless
and
learned
in
the
secrets
of
the
forest
as
the
indians
these
armies
set
out
in
the
depth
of
winter
french
and
indian
alike
were
smeared
with
and
decked
with
feathers
shod
with
snow
shoes
they
sped
over
the
snow
dragging
light
sledges
behind
them
laden
with
food
for
days
they
journeyed
over
plains
through
forest
across
rivers
but
at
length
one
of
the
armies
reached
the
village
of
schenectady
the
very
farthest
outpost
of
new
york
the
people
had
been
warned
of
their
danger
but
they
paid
no
heed
they
did
not
believe
that
the
danger
was
real
so
secure
indeed
did
they
feel
that
the
gates
were
left
wide
open
and
on
either
side
for
sentinels
stood
two
snow
men
in
all
the
village
there
was
no
sound
no
light
every
one
was
sleeping
peacefully
then
suddenly
through
the
stillness
there
rang
the
awful
indian
war
whoop
in
terror
the
villagers
leaped
from
their
beds
but
before
they
could
seize
their
weapons
they
were
struck
down
neither
man
woman
nor
child
was
spared
and
before
the
sun
was
high
schenectady
was
a
smoking
ruin
the
other
parties
which
frontenac
had
sent
out
also
caused
terrible
havoc
they
surprised
and
burned
many
villages
and
farms
slaughtering
and
carrying
prisoner
the
inhabitants
thus
all
new
england
was
filled
with
bloodshed
and
terror
but
these
horrors
instead
of
making
the
british
give
in
made
them
determined
to
attack
canada
new
york
and
the
colonies
of
new
england
joined
together
and
decided
to
make
an
attack
by
land
and
by
sea
the
british
determined
to
attack
canada
but
what
with
mismanagement
sickness
and
bickerings
among
the
various
colonies
the
land
attack
came
to
nothing
it
was
left
for
the
fleet
to
conquer
canada
the
little
new
england
fleet
was
commanded
by
sir
william
phips
a
bluff
sailor
he
sailed
up
the
lawrence
and
anchored
a
little
below
quebec
then
the
watching
frenchmen
saw
a
small
boat
put
off
flying
a
white
flag
as
it
neared
the
shore
some
canoes
went
out
to
meet
it
and
found
that
it
was
bringing
a
young
british
officer
with
a
letter
for
count
frontenac
the
officer
was
allowed
to
land
but
first
his
eyes
were
blindfolded
then
as
he
stepped
on
shore
a
sailor
seized
each
arm
and
thus
he
was
led
through
the
streets
quebec
is
built
on
a
height
and
the
streets
are
steep
and
narrow
sometimes
being
nothing
more
than
flights
of
steps
and
now
instead
of
being
taken
directly
to
the
governor
the
young
officer
was
dragged
up
and
down
these
steep
and
stony
streets
now
here
now
there
he
was
led
stumbling
blindly
over
stones
and
steps
and
followed
by
a
laughing
jeering
crowd
who
told
him
it
was
a
game
of
blind
man
bluff
at
last
thoroughly
bewildered
and
exhausted
he
was
led
into
the
castle
and
the
bandage
was
suddenly
taken
from
his
eyes
confused
and
dazzled
by
the
bright
light
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
stupidly
about
him
before
him
haughty
and
defiant
stood
frontenac
surrounded
by
his
officers
their
splendid
uniforms
glittered
with
gold
and
silver
lace
their
wigs
were
curled
and
powdered
their
hats
were
decked
with
feathers
as
if
for
a
ball
rather
than
for
war
for
a
moment
the
young
englishman
stood
abashed
before
them
then
recovering
himself
he
handed
his
commander
letters
to
frontenac
the
letter
was
written
in
english
but
an
interpreter
read
it
aloud
translating
it
into
french
in
haughty
language
it
demanded
the
surrender
of
quebec
in
the
name
of
william
and
mary
within
an
hour
when
the
reading
was
finished
the
officer
pulled
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
it
towards
frontenac
i
can
not
see
the
time
said
he
it
is
ten
replied
the
englishman
by
eleven
i
must
have
your
answer
frontenac
brow
grew
dark
with
anger
hitherto
he
had
held
himself
in
check
but
now
his
wrath
burst
forth
by
heaven
he
cried
i
will
not
keep
you
waiting
so
long
tell
your
general
that
i
do
not
acknowledge
king
william
the
prince
of
orange
who
calls
himself
so
is
a
usurper
i
know
of
no
king
of
england
save
king
james
the
englishman
was
quite
taken
aback
by
frontenac
vehemence
he
felt
he
could
not
go
back
to
his
leader
with
such
an
answer
will
you
give
me
your
answer
in
writing
he
said
no
thundered
frontenac
i
will
answer
your
general
with
the
mouths
of
my
cannon
only
let
him
do
his
best
and
i
will
do
mine
and
with
this
answer
the
englishman
was
forced
to
be
content
once
more
his
eyes
were
blindfolded
and
again
he
was
jostled
and
hustled
through
the
streets
until
he
reached
his
boat
when
phips
received
frontenac
proud
answer
he
prepared
to
attack
but
he
was
no
match
for
the
fierce
old
lion
of
a
frenchman
the
new
englanders
were
brave
enough
but
they
had
little
discipline
and
worse
still
they
had
no
leader
worthy
of
the
name
they
spent
shot
and
shell
uselessly
battering
the
solid
rock
upon
which
quebec
is
built
their
aim
was
bad
and
their
guns
so
small
that
even
when
the
balls
hit
the
mark
they
did
little
damage
at
length
having
wasted
most
of
their
ammunition
in
a
useless
cannonade
the
british
sailed
away
the
men
were
dejected
and
gloomy
at
their
failure
many
of
their
ships
had
been
sorely
disabled
by
the
french
guns
and
on
the
way
home
several
were
wrecked
as
the
others
struggled
homeward
with
their
tale
of
disaster
new
england
was
filled
with
sadness
and
dismay
the
attack
on
canada
had
been
an
utter
failure
yet
had
phips
but
known
it
quebec
was
almost
in
his
grasp
for
although
there
were
men
enough
within
the
fortress
there
was
little
food
and
even
before
he
sailed
away
the
pangs
of
hunger
had
made
themselves
felt
for
seven
years
more
the
war
lingered
on
but
now
it
chiefly
consisted
of
border
raids
and
skirmishes
and
the
new
englanders
formed
no
more
designs
of
conquering
canada
and
at
length
in
with
the
treaty
of
ryswick
king
william
war
came
to
an
end
in
james
the
exiled
king
of
britain
died
and
louis
of
france
recognised
his
son
james
as
the
rightful
king
of
britain
this
made
king
william
angry
louis
also
placed
his
grandson
the
duke
of
anjou
on
the
throne
of
spain
this
made
king
william
and
the
british
people
still
more
angry
for
with
a
french
king
on
the
throne
of
spain
they
thought
it
very
likely
that
france
and
spain
might
one
day
be
joined
together
and
become
too
powerful
so
king
william
again
declared
war
on
france
but
before
the
war
began
he
died
queen
mary
sister
anne
now
became
queen
she
carried
on
the
war
already
declared
this
war
brought
fighting
in
america
as
well
as
in
europe
in
america
it
is
called
queen
anne
war
and
in
europe
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
queen
anne
war
this
war
was
carried
on
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
last
there
were
indian
massacres
sudden
sallies
attacks
by
land
and
sea
but
this
time
the
british
were
more
determined
and
although
another
attack
on
quebec
failed
just
as
the
attack
made
by
phips
had
failed
one
on
nova
scotia
succeeded
in
the
south
too
the
spaniards
were
defeated
at
charleston
taken
altogether
the
british
had
the
best
of
the
fighting
and
when
at
length
peace
was
made
by
the
treaty
of
utrect
in
nova
scotia
newfoundland
and
the
hudson
bay
territory
were
given
up
to
the
british
thus
both
in
west
and
north
the
british
enclosed
the
french
possessions
chapter
the
mississippi
bubble
being
thus
encroached
upon
by
the
british
the
french
became
more
determined
to
shut
them
out
from
the
south
already
twelve
years
after
la
salle
death
another
attempt
had
been
made
to
found
a
town
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
this
time
the
attempt
was
successful
this
time
the
expedition
was
led
by
pierre
le
moyne
sieur
in
with
two
ships
he
sailed
out
from
france
and
after
some
trouble
found
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
he
did
not
however
build
his
fort
here
but
on
the
coast
of
what
is
now
the
state
of
mississippi
then
leaving
one
of
his
officers
and
his
brother
in
command
he
sailed
home
again
to
france
while
was
away
his
brother
bienville
started
on
an
expedition
to
explore
the
mississippi
and
he
soon
discovered
that
the
french
had
taken
possession
none
too
soon
for
not
far
from
where
new
orleans
now
stands
he
fell
in
with
a
british
ship
on
board
were
a
lot
of
french
huguenot
families
who
had
come
to
found
a
settlement
on
the
mississippi
bienville
talked
to
the
captain
who
told
him
that
this
was
one
of
three
ships
sent
out
from
england
by
a
company
formed
of
huguenots
and
englishmen
who
intended
to
found
a
colony
on
the
mississippi
they
were
not
sure
however
whether
they
were
on
the
mississippi
or
not
bienville
at
once
assured
them
that
they
were
not
but
were
instead
on
a
river
which
belonged
to
louis
of
france
where
already
the
french
had
several
settlements
the
british
captain
believed
what
he
was
told
and
much
to
the
frenchmen
delight
turned
back
just
at
the
spot
where
this
took
place
the
river
makes
a
bed
and
because
of
this
it
was
given
the
name
of
english
bend
by
which
name
it
is
known
to
this
day
only
stayed
long
enough
in
france
to
gather
more
colonists
and
returned
at
once
to
louisiana
where
he
founded
two
more
towns
along
the
coast
but
the
colonists
sent
out
by
louis
were
of
the
lowest
many
of
them
were
little
more
than
rogues
and
vagabonds
the
mere
of
the
towns
they
were
idle
and
extravagant
and
the
colony
did
not
prosper
instead
of
putting
gold
into
louis
pockets
as
he
had
hoped
he
had
constantly
to
pour
it
out
to
maintain
the
colony
of
that
louis
soon
grew
tired
besides
this
he
wanted
all
the
money
he
could
gather
to
carry
on
the
war
queen
anne
war
which
was
still
raging
so
in
he
handed
louisiana
over
to
a
wealthy
merchant
named
crozat
to
make
what
he
could
out
of
it
such
great
power
was
given
to
this
merchant
that
he
was
little
less
than
a
king
he
had
every
monopoly
nobody
in
the
colony
could
buy
or
sell
the
smallest
thing
without
his
permission
and
every
one
had
to
work
for
him
and
not
for
themselves
but
the
people
were
by
no
means
willing
workers
they
were
said
one
of
their
priests
nearly
all
drunkards
gamblers
blasphemers
and
foes
of
everything
that
was
good
and
when
they
found
that
they
are
expected
to
work
merely
to
put
money
into
the
proprietor
pocket
they
would
not
work
at
all
so
very
soon
crozat
found
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
the
colony
and
after
some
vain
efforts
to
make
it
pay
he
gave
up
his
charter
and
louisiana
once
more
became
a
royal
possession
meanwhile
france
itself
was
in
sore
straits
for
money
louis
xiv
that
magnificent
and
extravagant
monarch
had
died
and
left
his
country
beggared
and
in
want
the
duke
of
orleans
now
ruled
as
regent
for
little
louis
xv
he
was
at
his
wit
end
to
know
where
to
find
money
when
a
clever
scots
adventurer
names
john
law
came
to
him
with
a
new
and
splendid
idea
this
was
to
use
paper
money
instead
of
gold
and
silver
the
regent
was
greatly
taken
with
the
idea
and
he
gave
law
leave
to
issue
the
paper
money
it
was
quite
a
good
idea
had
it
been
kept
within
bounds
but
it
was
not
kept
within
bounds
all
france
went
mad
with
eagerness
to
get
some
of
the
paper
money
which
was
they
thought
going
to
make
them
rich
forever
besides
issuing
paper
money
law
started
what
was
known
as
the
mississippi
scheme
or
company
of
the
indies
in
louisiana
which
had
been
received
back
from
crozat
was
handed
over
to
john
law
who
undertook
to
settle
the
country
and
work
the
gold
and
silver
mines
which
were
supposed
to
be
there
law
began
at
once
to
fill
all
france
with
stories
of
louisiana
and
its
delights
gold
and
silver
mines
he
said
had
been
discovered
there
which
were
so
rich
that
they
could
never
be
used
up
lumps
of
gold
lay
about
everywhere
and
one
might
have
them
for
the
picking
up
as
for
silver
it
was
so
common
that
it
had
little
value
except
to
be
used
for
paving
the
streets
in
proof
of
these
stories
lumps
of
gold
said
to
have
come
from
louisiana
were
shown
in
the
shops
of
paris
as
to
the
climate
it
was
the
most
perfect
on
earth
it
was
never
too
hot
and
never
too
cold
but
always
warm
and
sunny
the
soil
was
so
fertile
that
one
had
but
to
scratch
it
to
produce
the
finest
crops
delicious
fruits
grew
everywhere
and
might
be
gathered
all
the
year
round
the
meadows
were
made
beautiful
and
the
air
scented
with
the
loveliest
of
flowers
in
fact
louisiana
was
painted
as
an
earthly
paradise
where
nothing
the
heart
could
desire
was
lacking
people
believed
these
stories
and
believing
them
it
was
not
wonderful
that
they
desired
to
possess
for
themselves
some
of
these
delights
so
rich
and
poor
high
and
low
rushed
to
buy
shares
in
the
company
the
street
in
paris
where
the
offices
of
the
company
were
was
choked
from
end
to
end
with
a
struggling
crowd
the
rich
brought
their
hundreds
the
poor
their
scanty
savings
great
lords
and
ladies
sold
their
lands
and
houses
in
order
to
have
money
to
buy
more
shares
the
poor
went
ragged
and
hungry
in
order
to
scrape
together
a
few
pence
peers
and
merchants
soldiers
priests
fine
ladies
servants
statesmen
labourers
all
jostled
together
and
fought
to
buy
the
magic
paper
which
would
make
them
rich
and
happy
beyond
belief
fortunes
were
made
and
lost
in
a
day
some
who
had
been
rich
found
themselves
penniless
others
who
had
always
lived
in
poverty
found
themselves
suddenly
rolling
in
wealth
which
they
did
not
know
how
to
use
and
john
law
was
the
wizard
whose
magic
wand
had
created
all
these
riches
he
was
flattered
and
courted
by
every
one
the
greatest
princes
in
the
land
came
to
beg
favours
of
him
they
came
to
him
to
beg
and
he
treated
them
haughtily
as
beggars
and
bade
them
wait
day
by
day
and
month
by
month
the
madness
increased
and
the
gigantic
bubble
grew
larger
and
larger
bienville
meanwhile
who
had
been
deprived
of
his
governorship
was
once
more
made
governor
of
louisiana
with
a
company
of
settlers
he
returned
again
to
the
colony
in
and
he
at
once
set
about
building
a
capital
which
in
honour
of
the
regent
he
called
new
orleans
the
place
he
chose
for
a
capital
was
covered
with
forest
so
before
any
building
could
be
done
fifty
men
were
set
to
fell
the
trees
and
clear
a
space
and
then
the
first
foundations
of
the
new
great
city
of
new
orleans
were
laid
but
still
the
colony
did
not
prosper
for
the
colonists
were
for
the
most
part
rogues
and
vagabonds
sent
there
by
force
and
kept
there
equally
by
force
they
looked
upon
louisiana
as
a
prison
and
tried
constantly
to
escape
from
it
meanwhile
no
ships
laden
with
gold
and
gems
reached
france
for
no
gold
mines
had
ever
been
discovered
then
people
began
to
grow
tired
of
waiting
some
of
them
began
to
suspect
that
all
the
stories
of
the
splendours
of
louisiana
were
not
true
and
they
tried
to
sell
their
paper
money
and
paper
shares
and
get
back
the
gold
which
they
had
given
for
them
soon
every
one
wanted
to
sell
and
no
one
wanted
to
buy
the
value
of
the
paper
money
fell
and
fell
until
it
was
worth
less
than
nothing
people
who
had
thought
themselves
millionaires
found
themselves
beggars
law
who
had
been
flattered
and
courted
was
now
hated
and
cursed
and
in
terror
of
his
life
he
fled
from
france
in
to
die
miserably
in
italy
a
few
years
later
as
to
louisiana
a
new
set
of
stories
were
told
of
it
now
it
was
no
longer
described
as
a
sort
of
earthly
paradise
but
as
a
place
of
horror
and
misery
it
was
a
land
of
noisome
marsh
and
gloomy
forest
where
prowled
every
imaginable
evil
beast
at
certain
times
of
the
year
the
river
flooded
the
whole
land
so
that
the
people
were
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
the
trees
there
they
lived
more
like
monkeys
than
men
springing
from
tree
to
tree
in
search
of
food
the
sun
was
so
hot
that
it
could
strike
a
man
dead
as
if
with
a
pistol
this
was
called
sunstroke
luscious
fruits
indeed
grew
around
but
they
were
all
poisonous
and
those
who
ate
of
them
died
in
agonies
in
fact
louisiana
was
now
pictured
as
a
place
to
be
shunned
as
a
place
of
punishment
be
good
or
i
will
send
you
to
the
mississippi
was
a
threat
terrible
enough
to
make
the
naughtiest
child
obedient
the
mississippi
bubble
burst
but
still
france
clung
to
louisiana
once
again
it
became
a
royal
province
and
at
length
after
long
years
of
struggle
it
began
to
prosper
the
french
had
thus
two
great
centres
of
power
in
america
one
at
quebec
amid
the
pine
trees
and
snows
of
the
north
and
one
at
new
orleans
amid
the
palm
trees
and
sunshine
of
the
south
and
between
the
two
fort
after
fort
was
built
until
gradually
north
and
south
were
united
thus
la
salle
dream
came
true
it
was
during
the
time
of
peace
after
the
end
of
queen
anne
war
that
the
french
had
thus
strengthened
their
hold
on
america
and
joined
canada
and
louisiana
they
had
also
built
a
strong
fortress
on
the
island
of
cape
breton
which
commanded
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
this
fortress
was
called
louisburg
in
honour
of
king
louis
and
it
was
the
strongest
and
best
fortified
in
the
whole
of
new
france
the
walls
were
solid
and
high
and
bristled
with
more
than
a
hundred
cannon
the
moat
was
both
wide
and
deep
indeed
the
french
believe
that
this
fort
was
so
strong
that
no
power
on
earth
could
take
it
but
the
days
of
peace
sped
fast
soon
once
more
europe
was
ablaze
with
war
france
and
britain
again
taking
opposite
sides
in
europe
this
war
is
called
the
war
of
the
austrian
succession
because
it
was
brought
on
by
a
quarrel
among
the
nations
of
europe
as
to
who
should
succeed
to
the
throne
of
austria
in
america
it
is
called
king
george
war
as
king
george
ii
was
king
of
britain
at
the
time
like
the
other
wars
before
it
it
was
fought
in
america
as
well
as
in
europe
the
chief
event
in
america
was
the
capture
of
louisburg
in
that
redoubtable
fortress
which
it
was
thought
would
hold
off
any
attack
yielded
after
six
weeks
to
an
army
chiefly
composed
of
new
england
farmers
and
fishermen
and
led
by
maine
merchant
who
had
no
knowledge
of
war
when
the
news
that
louisburg
was
taken
reached
new
england
the
people
rejoiced
bells
were
rung
cannons
were
fired
and
bonfires
blazed
in
all
the
chief
towns
in
england
itself
the
news
was
received
with
surprise
and
delight
and
pepperell
the
was
made
a
baronet
and
could
henceforth
call
himself
sir
william
pepperell
but
when
the
french
heard
that
they
had
lost
their
splendid
american
fortress
they
were
filled
with
dismay
one
after
another
three
expeditions
were
sent
to
recapture
it
but
one
after
another
they
miscarried
and
when
at
length
in
peace
was
agreed
upon
louisburg
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
new
englanders
the
peace
which
was
now
signed
is
called
the
peace
of
by
it
it
was
agreed
that
each
side
should
give
back
all
its
conquests
so
that
after
all
the
terrible
loss
and
bloodshed
neither
side
was
one
whit
the
better
the
new
englanders
had
been
greatly
delighted
at
their
conquest
of
louisburg
the
french
on
the
other
hand
were
greatly
grieved
and
when
terms
of
peace
were
discussed
louis
xv
insisted
that
louisburg
should
be
restored
that
can
not
be
said
king
george
it
is
not
mine
to
give
for
it
was
taken
by
the
people
of
boston
the
french
however
were
firm
so
king
george
gave
way
and
louisburg
was
restored
to
france
and
madras
in
india
which
the
french
had
taken
was
in
exchange
restored
to
britain
when
the
new
englanders
heard
of
it
they
were
very
angry
madras
was
nothing
to
them
it
was
but
a
petty
factory
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
while
louisburg
was
at
their
very
doors
and
of
vast
importance
to
their
security
they
had
to
obey
and
give
it
back
but
they
did
so
with
bitterness
in
their
hearts
against
a
king
who
cared
so
little
for
their
welfare
chapter
how
a
terrible
disaster
befell
the
british
army
we
have
now
seen
something
of
the
great
struggle
between
french
and
british
for
the
continent
of
america
war
after
war
broke
out
peace
after
peace
was
signed
but
each
peace
was
no
more
than
a
truce
and
even
when
the
noise
of
cannon
ceased
there
was
nearly
always
war
with
the
redman
for
he
took
sides
and
fought
for
french
or
british
and
as
years
went
past
the
struggle
grew
ever
more
and
more
bitter
if
the
french
had
their
way
the
british
would
have
been
hemmed
in
between
the
alleghenies
and
the
sea
if
the
british
had
had
their
way
the
french
would
have
been
confined
to
a
little
strip
of
land
north
of
the
lawrence
it
became
plain
at
length
to
every
one
that
in
all
the
wide
continent
there
was
no
room
for
both
one
must
go
but
which
the
peace
at
was
not
a
year
old
before
the
last
great
struggle
began
both
french
and
british
had
now
cast
their
eyes
on
the
valley
of
the
ohio
and
the
spot
where
pittsburgh
now
stands
became
known
as
the
gateway
of
the
west
the
british
determined
to
possess
that
gateway
but
the
french
were
just
as
determined
to
prevent
them
ever
getting
through
it
so
the
french
began
to
build
a
line
of
forts
from
lake
erie
southward
to
the
gate
of
the
west
now
virginia
claimed
all
this
land
and
when
two
french
forts
had
been
built
the
governor
of
virginia
began
to
be
both
alarmed
and
angry
he
decided
therefore
to
send
a
messenger
to
the
french
to
tell
them
that
they
were
on
british
ground
and
bid
them
to
be
gone
it
was
not
an
easy
task
and
one
which
had
to
be
done
with
courtesy
and
firmness
therefore
dinwiddie
resolved
to
send
a
person
of
distinction
so
as
his
messenger
he
chose
a
young
man
named
george
washington
he
was
a
straightforward
tall
young
man
well
used
to
a
woodland
life
but
withal
a
gentleman
the
descendant
of
one
of
the
old
royalist
families
who
had
come
to
virginia
in
the
time
of
cromwell
and
just
the
very
man
for
the
governor
purpose
it
was
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
through
pathless
forest
over
hills
deep
snows
and
frozen
rivers
a
journey
which
none
but
one
skilled
in
forest
lore
could
endure
but
at
length
after
weeks
of
weary
marching
washington
arrived
at
fort
le
boeuf
the
frenchmen
greeted
him
courteously
and
entertained
him
in
the
most
friendly
fashion
during
the
three
days
which
the
commander
took
to
make
up
his
answer
the
answer
was
not
very
satisfactory
the
commander
promised
to
send
dinwiddie
letter
to
the
governor
of
canada
but
meanwhile
he
added
my
men
and
i
will
stay
where
we
are
i
have
been
commanded
to
take
possession
of
the
country
and
i
mean
to
do
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
with
this
answer
washington
set
out
again
and
after
many
adventures
and
dangers
arrived
safely
once
more
at
williamsburg
in
the
spring
the
frenchmen
marched
south
to
the
gateway
of
the
west
here
they
found
a
party
of
british
who
had
begun
to
build
a
fort
the
french
who
were
in
far
greater
numbers
surrounded
them
and
bade
them
surrender
this
the
british
did
being
utterly
unable
to
defend
themselves
the
french
then
seized
the
fort
leveled
it
to
the
ground
and
began
to
build
one
of
their
own
which
they
called
fort
duquesne
upon
this
dinwiddie
resolved
to
dislodge
the
french
and
he
sent
a
small
force
and
when
its
leader
died
he
took
command
but
he
was
not
able
to
dislodge
the
french
so
after
some
fighting
he
was
obliged
to
make
terms
with
the
enemy
and
march
home
discomfited
up
to
this
time
the
war
was
purely
an
american
one
france
and
britain
were
at
peace
and
neither
country
sent
soldiers
to
help
their
colonies
it
was
the
settlers
the
farmers
fishermen
and
fur
traders
of
new
england
and
new
france
who
fought
each
other
and
in
this
the
french
had
one
great
advantage
over
the
british
the
french
were
united
the
british
were
not
new
france
was
like
one
great
colony
in
which
every
man
was
ready
to
answer
the
call
to
battle
the
british
were
divided
into
thirteen
colonies
each
one
of
the
thirteen
colonies
was
jealous
of
all
the
others
each
was
selfishly
concerned
with
its
own
welfare
and
quite
careless
of
the
welfare
of
the
others
but
already
the
feelings
of
patriotism
had
been
born
among
the
many
who
cared
nothing
for
union
there
were
a
few
who
did
there
were
some
who
were
neither
virginians
nor
new
englanders
neither
georgians
nor
carolinians
but
americans
these
now
felt
that
if
they
were
not
to
become
the
vassals
of
france
they
must
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
a
congress
of
all
the
northern
colonies
was
now
called
at
albany
to
discuss
some
means
of
defense
and
at
this
congress
benjamin
franklin
proposed
a
plan
of
union
but
the
colonies
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
some
took
no
notice
of
it
at
all
others
treated
it
with
scorn
or
said
it
put
too
much
power
into
the
hands
of
the
king
as
to
the
king
when
he
heard
of
it
he
rejected
it
also
for
said
he
it
gave
too
much
power
to
the
colonies
so
for
the
time
being
nothing
came
of
it
meanwhile
the
governors
of
the
various
colonies
wrote
home
to
england
and
seeing
how
serious
the
matter
was
becoming
the
british
government
sent
out
two
regiments
of
soldiers
to
help
the
colonies
they
were
about
a
thousand
men
in
all
and
were
under
the
leadership
of
edward
braddock
as
so
as
the
french
heard
this
they
too
sent
soldiers
to
canada
it
was
just
like
a
game
of
catch
who
catch
can
for
as
soon
as
the
british
knew
that
french
troops
were
sailing
to
america
they
sent
a
squadron
to
stop
them
but
the
french
had
got
a
start
and
most
of
them
got
away
the
british
ships
however
overtook
some
which
had
lagged
behind
the
others
as
soon
as
they
were
within
hailing
distance
a
red
flag
was
suddenly
run
up
to
the
masthead
of
the
british
flagship
is
this
peace
or
war
shouted
the
french
captain
i
do
know
answered
the
british
but
you
had
better
prepare
for
war
he
however
gave
the
frenchman
little
time
to
prepare
for
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
the
thunder
of
cannon
was
heard
the
frenchmen
fought
pluckily
but
they
were
far
outnumbered
and
were
soon
forced
to
surrender
thus
both
on
land
and
sea
fighting
had
begun
yet
war
had
not
been
declared
and
king
george
and
king
louis
were
still
calling
each
other
dear
cousin
or
dear
brother
and
making
believe
that
there
was
no
thought
of
war
but
the
little
success
on
sea
was
followed
up
by
a
bitter
disaster
on
land
general
braddock
now
commanded
the
whole
army
both
home
and
colonial
he
was
a
brave
and
honest
man
but
obstinate
and
narrow
he
had
a
tremendous
idea
of
what
his
own
soldiers
could
do
and
he
was
very
scornful
of
the
colonials
he
was
still
more
scornful
of
the
indians
these
savages
he
said
to
franklin
may
indeed
be
a
formidable
enemy
to
your
raw
american
militia
but
upon
the
king
regular
and
disciplined
troops
sir
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
make
any
impression
the
haughty
savages
were
quick
to
see
that
he
looked
down
upon
them
he
looks
upon
us
as
dogs
they
said
and
drawing
their
ragged
blankets
about
them
they
stalked
off
deeply
offended
with
the
same
narrow
pride
braddock
turned
away
another
useful
ally
this
was
captain
jack
the
black
hunter
he
was
a
white
man
but
he
roamed
the
woods
dressed
like
an
indian
followed
be
a
band
of
men
as
reckless
and
lawless
as
himself
the
black
hunter
however
although
he
dressed
like
an
indian
was
the
white
man
friend
the
redman
deadly
foe
he
had
been
at
one
time
it
was
said
a
peaceful
settler
living
happily
with
his
wife
and
children
but
one
day
he
returned
from
hunting
to
find
his
cottage
in
ashes
and
his
wife
and
children
dead
among
the
ruins
in
his
grief
and
rage
he
vowed
eternal
vengeance
on
the
indians
who
had
done
the
evil
deed
robbing
him
for
ever
of
home
and
happiness
henceforth
he
roamed
the
woods
a
terror
to
the
redmen
for
his
aim
was
unerring
he
could
steal
through
the
forest
as
silently
and
swiftly
as
they
and
was
as
learned
in
all
the
woodland
lore
his
very
name
indeed
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
all
his
foes
black
hunter
now
with
his
wild
band
of
followers
offered
his
help
to
braddock
they
were
well
armed
they
cared
neither
for
heat
nor
cold
they
required
no
tents
nor
shelter
for
the
night
not
did
they
ask
for
any
pay
general
braddock
looked
at
the
gaunt
man
of
the
woods
clad
in
hunting
shirt
and
moccasins
painted
and
bedecked
with
feathers
like
an
indian
truly
a
strange
ally
he
thought
i
have
experienced
troops
he
said
on
whom
i
can
depend
and
finding
that
he
could
get
no
other
answer
black
hunter
and
his
men
drew
off
and
disappeared
into
the
woods
whence
they
had
come
on
the
other
hand
braddock
had
much
to
put
up
with
the
whole
success
of
the
expedition
depended
on
swiftness
the
british
must
strike
a
blow
before
the
french
had
time
to
arm
but
when
braddock
landed
nothing
was
ready
there
were
no
stores
no
horses
no
wagons
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
gather
them
nobody
seemed
to
care
greatly
whether
the
expedition
set
out
or
not
so
goaded
to
fury
braddock
stamped
and
swore
and
declared
that
nearly
every
one
he
had
to
do
with
was
stupid
or
dishonest
but
at
length
the
preparations
were
complete
and
in
june
the
expedition
set
out
from
the
first
things
went
wrong
had
braddock
gone
through
pennsylvania
he
would
have
found
a
great
part
of
his
road
cleared
for
him
but
he
went
through
virginia
and
had
to
hew
his
way
through
pathless
forest
in
front
of
the
army
went
three
hundred
axemen
to
cut
down
trees
and
clear
a
passage
behind
them
the
long
baggage
train
jolted
slowly
onwards
now
floundering
axle
deep
through
mud
now
rocking
perilously
over
stumps
or
stones
on
either
side
threading
in
and
out
among
the
trees
marched
the
soldiers
so
day
after
day
the
cavalcade
wound
along
bugle
call
and
sound
of
drum
awakening
the
forest
silences
the
march
was
toilsome
and
many
of
the
men
unused
to
the
hardships
of
the
wilderness
fell
ill
and
the
slow
progress
became
slower
still
at
length
braddock
decided
to
divide
his
force
and
leaving
the
sick
men
and
the
heaviest
baggage
behind
press
on
more
rapidly
with
the
others
it
was
george
washington
who
went
with
him
as
an
who
advised
this
so
the
sick
and
all
baggage
that
could
be
done
without
were
left
behind
with
colonel
dunbar
but
even
after
this
the
progress
was
very
slow
meanwhile
news
of
the
coming
of
the
british
army
had
been
carried
to
the
french
at
fort
duquesne
and
when
they
heard
how
great
the
force
was
they
were
much
alarmed
but
a
gallant
frenchman
named
beaujeu
offered
to
go
out
and
meet
the
british
lie
in
wait
for
them
and
take
them
unawares
but
to
do
this
he
had
need
of
indian
help
so
council
fires
were
lit
and
beaujeu
flung
down
the
war
hatchet
but
the
indians
refused
it
for
they
were
afraid
of
the
great
british
force
do
you
want
to
die
our
father
they
asked
and
sacrifice
us
also
i
am
determined
to
go
said
beaujeu
what
will
you
let
your
father
go
alone
i
know
we
shall
win
seeing
him
so
confident
the
indians
forgot
their
fears
and
the
war
dance
was
danced
then
smeared
with
paint
and
led
by
beaujeu
himself
dressed
like
a
savage
they
marched
to
meet
the
british
there
were
about
six
hundred
indians
and
half
as
many
frenchmen
stealthily
they
crept
through
the
forest
flitting
like
shadows
from
tree
to
tree
closing
ever
nearer
and
nearer
upon
the
british
they
meanwhile
had
reached
the
river
monongahela
they
crossed
it
gaily
for
they
knew
now
that
fort
duquesne
was
near
their
toilsome
march
was
at
an
end
and
victory
was
sure
it
was
a
glorious
summer
morning
the
bands
played
the
men
laughed
and
shouted
joyously
the
long
line
swept
onward
a
glittering
pageant
of
scarlet
and
blue
of
shining
steel
and
fluttering
banners
then
suddenly
out
of
the
forest
darted
a
man
dressed
like
an
indian
when
he
saw
the
advancing
column
he
stopped
then
turning
he
waved
to
some
one
behind
him
it
was
beaujeu
and
at
his
signal
the
air
was
rent
with
the
terrible
indian
war
cry
and
a
hail
of
bullets
swept
the
british
ranks
shouting
god
save
the
king
the
british
returned
to
fire
but
it
availed
little
for
they
could
not
see
the
enemy
from
the
shelter
of
the
forest
hidden
behind
trees
the
french
and
indians
fired
upon
the
british
they
were
an
easy
mark
for
they
stood
solidly
shoulder
to
shoulder
their
scarlet
coats
showing
clearly
against
the
green
background
still
the
british
stood
their
ground
firing
volley
after
volley
it
was
quite
useless
for
they
could
see
no
enemy
the
puffs
of
smoke
were
their
only
guides
to
aim
at
the
points
where
the
smoke
came
from
was
all
they
could
do
but
for
the
most
part
their
bullets
crashed
through
the
branches
or
were
buried
in
tree
trunks
while
the
pitiless
rain
of
lead
mowed
down
the
redcoats
the
american
soldiers
fared
better
for
as
soon
as
they
were
attacked
they
scattered
and
from
behind
the
shelter
of
trees
fought
the
indians
in
their
own
fashion
some
of
the
british
tried
to
do
the
same
but
braddock
had
no
knowledge
of
savage
warfare
to
fight
in
such
a
manner
seemed
to
him
shocking
it
was
unsoldierly
it
was
cowardly
so
he
swore
savagely
at
his
men
calling
them
cowards
and
beat
them
back
into
line
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
thus
huddled
together
they
stood
a
brilliant
living
target
for
the
bullets
of
the
savages
braddock
himself
fought
with
fury
he
dashed
here
and
there
swearing
commanding
threatening
four
horses
were
shot
under
him
and
at
last
he
himself
fell
wounded
to
death
washington
too
fought
with
fearless
bravery
trying
to
carry
out
braddock
frenzied
orders
and
although
he
escaped
unhurt
his
clothes
were
riddled
with
holes
and
twice
his
horse
was
shot
under
him
for
nearly
three
hours
the
terrible
carnage
lasted
then
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
no
more
and
the
men
broke
rank
and
fled
all
night
they
fled
in
utter
rout
bearing
with
them
their
wounded
leader
at
length
they
reached
dunbar
camp
but
even
them
they
did
not
pause
for
the
news
of
the
disaster
had
thrown
the
whole
camp
into
confusion
frantic
orders
were
given
and
obeyed
with
frenzied
haste
wagon
loads
of
stores
were
burned
barrels
of
gunpowder
were
staved
in
and
the
contents
poured
into
the
river
shells
and
bullets
were
buried
the
the
work
of
destruction
complete
the
whole
army
moved
on
again
in
utter
rout
and
now
braddock
dark
last
hour
had
come
brooding
and
silent
he
lay
in
his
litter
this
awful
defeat
was
something
he
could
not
grasp
who
would
have
thought
it
he
murmured
who
would
have
thought
it
but
his
stubborn
spirit
was
yet
unbroken
we
will
know
better
how
to
do
it
another
time
he
sighed
a
few
minutes
later
he
died
his
men
buried
him
in
the
middle
of
the
road
washington
reading
over
him
the
prayers
for
the
dead
then
lest
the
indians
should
find
and
desecrate
his
last
the
whole
army
passed
over
his
grave
chapter
the
end
of
the
french
rule
in
america
braddock
campaign
was
a
complete
disaster
the
french
had
triumphed
and
even
those
indians
who
up
till
now
had
been
willing
to
side
with
the
british
were
anxious
to
make
friends
with
the
french
for
were
they
not
the
stronger
surely
it
seemed
to
them
the
white
father
of
the
lawrence
was
more
powerful
than
the
white
father
of
the
hudson
if
the
english
will
not
suffer
the
branches
of
the
great
tree
of
peace
to
hide
us
from
the
french
they
said
we
will
go
farther
off
we
will
lie
down
and
warm
ourselves
by
the
war
fires
of
the
french
we
love
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
war
whoop
we
delight
in
the
war
yell
it
flies
from
hill
to
hill
from
heart
to
heart
it
makes
the
old
heart
young
it
makes
the
young
heart
dance
our
young
braves
run
to
battle
with
the
swiftness
of
the
fawn
if
you
will
not
fight
the
french
will
drive
us
from
our
hunting
grounds
the
english
king
does
not
aid
us
we
must
join
the
strong
who
is
strong
who
is
strong
the
french
the
english
have
become
weak
war
was
now
really
declared
between
france
and
britain
and
fighting
took
place
in
europe
as
well
as
in
america
and
in
america
things
went
ill
for
the
british
defeats
and
disasters
followed
each
other
things
were
muddled
and
went
wrong
continually
for
truth
to
tell
the
british
had
no
great
leader
either
in
england
or
in
america
while
the
french
had
the
marquess
montcalm
one
of
the
best
soldiers
in
the
french
army
as
their
at
length
however
a
great
man
came
to
power
in
england
this
was
william
pitt
known
as
the
great
commoner
he
was
it
has
been
said
the
first
englishman
of
his
time
and
he
made
england
the
first
country
in
the
world
he
was
a
great
judge
of
men
and
he
had
a
happy
way
of
choosing
the
right
man
for
the
right
place
so
now
instead
of
defeats
came
victories
not
only
in
america
but
all
over
the
world
we
are
forced
to
ask
every
morning
said
a
witty
man
of
the
time
what
victory
there
has
been
for
fear
of
missing
one
in
america
louisburg
fell
once
more
into
the
hands
of
the
british
fort
duquesne
too
was
taken
and
the
misery
of
braddock
disaster
was
wiped
out
then
in
honour
of
the
great
statesman
the
name
of
the
fort
was
changed
to
pittsburg
it
is
still
called
by
that
name
and
is
now
one
of
the
world
greatest
manufacturing
cities
and
where
braddock
fought
and
fell
stretches
a
network
of
streets
but
although
the
british
had
many
successes
the
key
of
canada
defied
all
efforts
to
take
it
quebec
still
frowned
upon
her
rock
invulnerable
as
in
the
days
of
old
frontenac
among
the
men
pitt
had
chosen
to
lead
the
armies
in
america
was
james
wolfe
he
was
a
englishman
there
was
nothing
of
the
hero
about
his
appearance
except
his
bright
and
flashing
eyes
it
was
this
man
who
was
sent
to
capture
quebec
many
people
were
astonished
at
pitt
choice
he
is
mad
said
one
stupid
old
man
mad
is
he
said
king
george
then
i
wish
he
would
bite
some
others
of
my
generals
led
by
a
daring
old
sea
captain
the
british
war
ships
passed
safely
up
the
lawrence
and
anchored
off
the
isle
of
orleans
a
little
below
quebec
once
more
british
guns
thundered
against
the
high
rock
fortress
the
town
was
laid
in
ruins
the
country
round
was
but
a
barren
waste
yet
the
fortress
of
quebec
was
no
nearer
being
taken
than
before
weeks
and
months
went
past
the
fleet
rocked
idly
at
anchor
the
troops
lay
almost
as
idle
in
their
tents
only
the
gunners
had
work
to
do
and
although
they
shattered
the
walls
of
quebec
the
frenchmen
were
undaunted
you
may
ruin
the
town
they
said
but
you
will
never
get
inside
i
will
have
quebec
if
i
stay
here
till
the
end
of
november
replied
wolfe
but
montcalm
smiled
grimly
winter
he
knew
would
be
his
ally
for
then
the
lawrence
would
be
frozen
from
bank
to
bank
and
before
that
the
british
must
sail
away
or
be
caught
fast
in
its
icy
jaws
wolfe
who
was
frail
and
sickly
by
nature
now
broke
down
beneath
the
strain
and
the
constant
disappointments
helpless
and
in
agony
he
lay
on
his
sickbed
his
mind
still
busy
with
plans
of
how
to
take
quebec
doctor
he
said
i
know
you
ca
cure
me
but
patch
me
up
till
i
see
this
business
through
soon
he
was
about
again
and
making
plans
for
his
last
desperate
attempt
to
take
quebec
seeking
to
find
a
means
of
reaching
the
fortress
he
had
himself
examined
all
the
north
shores
of
the
lawrence
and
just
a
little
above
the
town
he
had
found
one
spot
where
a
narrow
pathway
led
up
the
steep
cliffs
it
was
so
steep
and
narrow
that
the
french
never
dreamed
of
any
one
making
an
attack
that
way
and
it
was
carelessly
guarded
but
dangerous
though
it
was
it
seemed
to
wolfe
the
only
way
and
he
determined
to
attempt
it
soon
his
preparations
were
made
and
one
dark
moonless
night
in
september
a
long
procession
of
boats
floated
silently
down
the
river
in
one
of
the
boats
sat
wolfe
and
as
they
drifted
slowly
along
in
the
starlight
in
a
low
voice
he
repeated
gray
poem
called
an
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
the
boast
of
heraldry
the
pomp
of
power
and
all
that
beauty
all
that
wealth
gave
awaits
alike
th
inevitable
hour
the
paths
of
glory
lead
but
to
the
grave
gentlemen
said
wolfe
when
he
finished
i
would
rather
have
written
those
lines
than
take
quebec
in
dead
silence
now
the
boats
drifted
on
then
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
rang
a
sharp
challenge
who
goes
there
was
asked
in
french
france
replied
a
highland
officer
who
spoke
good
french
what
regiment
shouted
the
sentry
the
queen
answered
the
officer
glibly
for
luckily
he
had
learned
from
french
prisoners
that
boats
with
provisions
were
expected
by
the
enemy
and
that
very
likely
the
queen
regiment
would
convoy
them
the
sentry
was
satisfied
and
let
the
boats
pass
but
they
were
not
safe
yet
a
little
further
on
they
were
challenged
again
the
same
officer
replied
speak
louder
cried
the
sentry
hush
replied
the
highlander
provision
boats
i
say
do
not
make
a
noise
the
british
will
hear
us
the
sentry
was
quite
deceived
he
let
the
boats
pass
and
very
soon
the
men
were
safely
landed
then
the
climb
began
like
wild
mountain
cats
the
men
dashed
at
it
they
swung
themselves
up
by
branches
of
trees
gripping
projecting
stones
and
roots
with
hand
and
knee
it
was
hot
breathless
work
but
soon
they
were
near
the
top
but
they
had
been
heard
once
more
the
challenge
rang
out
who
goes
there
france
panted
a
voice
from
below
but
this
time
the
sentry
was
not
deceived
he
could
see
nothing
but
he
fired
at
a
venture
down
into
the
darkness
it
was
too
late
the
first
men
had
reached
the
top
and
the
guard
was
overpowered
so
hour
by
hour
up
the
steep
cliff
the
red
coats
swarmed
unhindered
when
morning
dawned
four
thousand
british
stood
upon
the
plains
of
abraham
this
is
a
very
serious
business
said
montcalm
when
he
heard
of
it
but
it
can
only
be
a
small
party
soon
however
more
news
was
brought
to
him
it
was
no
small
party
then
we
must
crush
them
he
said
and
with
pale
set
face
he
rode
forth
to
battle
it
was
ten
when
the
fight
began
the
french
attacked
first
the
british
awaited
them
calmly
as
they
dashed
on
over
the
plain
on
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
then
suddenly
the
order
was
given
and
cheering
wildly
the
british
charged
a
shot
struck
wolfe
in
the
wrist
without
pausing
he
tied
a
handkerchief
about
it
again
he
was
hit
still
he
went
on
then
a
third
shot
struck
his
breast
and
he
fell
hastily
he
was
carried
to
the
rear
and
laid
upon
the
ground
it
is
all
over
with
me
he
sighed
then
he
lay
still
in
a
sort
of
stupor
suddenly
one
of
the
officers
beside
him
cried
out
they
run
they
run
who
run
said
wolfe
rousing
himself
the
enemy
sir
answered
the
officer
they
give
way
everywhere
now
god
be
praised
murmured
wolfe
i
die
happy
then
turning
on
his
side
he
died
everywhere
the
french
fled
and
in
their
mad
rush
they
carried
along
with
them
their
gallant
leader
montcalm
he
was
sorely
wounded
but
still
sat
his
horse
as
he
rode
within
the
gates
of
quebec
here
an
excited
eager
crowd
was
gathered
waiting
for
news
and
when
they
saw
montcalm
figure
on
his
black
horse
they
were
seized
with
dismay
for
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
and
blood
flowed
from
his
breast
alas
alas
cried
a
woman
in
a
piercing
voice
of
despair
the
marquess
is
killed
it
is
nothing
it
is
nothing
good
friends
he
replied
do
not
trouble
about
me
so
saying
he
fell
from
his
horse
into
the
arms
of
one
of
his
officers
that
night
he
died
he
was
glad
to
go
it
is
better
for
me
he
said
for
i
shall
not
live
to
see
quebec
surrender
with
him
died
the
last
hope
of
new
france
the
story
of
new
france
was
done
the
story
of
canada
was
about
to
begin
as
well
as
that
of
her
mighty
neighbour
for
as
a
great
english
historian
has
said
with
the
triumph
of
wolfe
on
the
heights
of
abraham
began
the
history
of
the
united
states
meanwhile
however
the
war
still
dragged
on
for
another
year
then
the
following
summer
montreal
surrendered
to
the
british
and
french
rule
in
america
was
completely
at
an
end
fighting
in
america
was
over
but
the
war
still
went
on
in
other
parts
of
the
world
spain
had
also
joined
in
the
struggle
and
from
them
the
british
took
cuba
and
the
philippine
islands
but
at
length
in
peace
was
made
by
the
treaty
of
paris
by
this
treaty
britain
was
confirmed
in
her
claim
to
nearly
the
whole
of
french
possessions
in
america
so
that
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mississippi
and
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
hudson
bay
was
now
declared
british
except
the
peninsula
forming
florida
that
the
spaniards
claimed
so
in
exchange
for
it
the
british
gave
back
cuba
and
the
philippines
and
to
make
up
to
spain
for
the
loss
of
florida
france
gave
them
new
orleans
and
resigned
to
spain
all
claims
to
the
land
which
la
salle
had
called
louisiana
thus
nothing
remained
to
france
of
all
her
great
possessions
in
america
and
the
vast
continent
was
divided
between
spain
and
britain
never
in
all
known
history
had
a
single
treaty
transferred
such
enormous
tracts
of
land
from
one
nation
to
another
chapter
the
rebellion
of
pontiac
do
you
not
know
the
difference
between
the
king
of
france
and
the
king
of
britain
a
frenchman
once
asked
an
indian
go
look
at
the
forts
which
our
king
has
built
you
will
see
that
you
can
still
hunt
under
their
very
walls
they
have
been
built
for
your
good
in
the
places
where
you
go
the
british
on
the
other
hand
are
no
sooner
in
possession
of
a
place
than
they
drive
the
game
away
the
trees
fall
before
them
the
earth
is
laid
bare
so
that
you
can
scarcely
find
a
few
branches
with
which
to
make
a
shelter
for
the
night
the
frenchman
spoke
truth
the
british
settlers
were
for
the
most
part
grave
and
earnest
men
who
had
come
to
seek
new
homes
they
felled
trees
and
built
their
houses
and
ploughed
the
land
turning
wilderness
into
cornfields
and
meadow
the
frenchmen
came
for
the
sake
of
religion
or
for
adventure
they
set
up
crosses
and
claimed
the
land
for
god
and
the
king
they
scattered
churches
and
hamlets
far
in
the
wilderness
but
left
the
wilderness
and
the
forest
still
the
redman
hunting
ground
the
frenchmen
treated
the
indians
with
an
easy
careless
sort
of
friendliness
while
most
of
the
british
looked
down
upon
them
as
savages
so
very
soon
after
the
british
took
possession
of
canada
the
indians
became
very
discontented
for
now
they
got
no
more
presents
they
were
no
longer
treated
as
brothers
and
they
were
hurt
both
in
their
pockets
and
their
pride
the
english
mean
to
make
slaves
of
us
they
said
in
haughty
indignation
and
soon
a
plot
to
murder
all
the
british
was
formed
the
french
who
still
lived
in
canada
encouraged
the
indians
in
their
discontent
telling
them
that
the
english
meant
thoroughly
to
root
them
out
then
a
great
medicine
man
arose
among
them
who
preached
war
the
great
spirit
himself
appeared
unto
me
he
said
thus
he
spake
am
the
lord
of
life
it
is
i
who
made
all
men
i
work
for
their
safety
therefore
i
give
you
warning
suffer
not
the
english
to
dwell
in
your
midst
lest
their
poisons
and
their
sickness
destroy
you
utterly
when
they
heard
the
medicine
man
speak
thus
the
indians
were
greatly
stirred
the
lord
of
life
himself
they
said
moves
our
hearts
to
war
they
became
ever
more
and
more
eager
to
fight
they
only
wanted
a
leader
and
found
one
in
pontiac
chief
of
the
ottawas
he
was
subtle
and
fierce
haughty
and
ambitious
and
by
far
the
most
clever
and
powerful
chief
who
ever
took
up
arms
against
the
white
man
now
he
sent
messengers
to
all
the
indian
villages
both
far
and
near
with
them
these
messengers
carried
a
hatchet
stained
with
blood
and
a
war
belt
of
scarlet
wampum
when
they
came
to
a
village
they
called
the
braves
together
then
in
their
midst
their
spokesman
flung
down
the
blood
stained
hatchet
and
holding
the
belt
in
his
hand
he
made
a
passionate
speech
reminding
the
redmen
of
their
wrongs
and
calling
upon
them
to
be
avenged
upon
their
foes
and
wherever
the
messengers
went
the
blood
stained
hatchet
was
seized
and
the
war
dance
danced
at
length
all
was
arranged
and
upon
a
certain
day
in
may
the
indians
were
to
rise
in
a
body
and
slay
the
british
to
a
man
only
the
french
were
to
be
spared
pontiac
himself
was
to
attack
fort
detroit
and
so
quietly
and
secretly
were
the
preparations
made
that
no
one
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
what
was
going
forward
but
the
day
before
the
attack
a
farmer
wife
rowed
across
the
river
and
went
to
the
indian
village
to
buy
some
maple
sugar
while
she
was
there
she
was
much
astonished
to
see
some
of
the
indian
braves
filing
off
the
barrels
of
their
guns
the
sight
made
her
uneasy
i
wonder
what
they
are
up
to
she
said
when
she
got
home
she
told
her
friends
what
she
had
seen
i
believe
they
are
up
to
some
mischief
she
repeated
i
think
so
too
said
a
blacksmith
they
have
been
asking
me
to
lend
them
files
and
saws
as
the
settlers
talked
the
matter
over
they
became
at
length
so
uneasy
that
they
sent
to
tell
major
gladwin
the
commander
of
the
fort
of
what
they
had
seen
he
however
thought
nothing
of
it
but
later
in
the
day
a
young
indian
girl
came
to
see
him
to
bring
him
a
pair
of
moccasins
which
he
had
asked
her
to
make
she
seemed
very
sad
and
downcast
and
after
she
had
given
the
major
the
moccasins
she
still
loitered
about
what
the
matter
asked
a
young
officer
the
indian
girl
did
not
answer
she
only
looked
at
him
gravely
with
sorrowful
brown
eyes
still
she
lingered
about
it
was
nearly
dark
time
almost
to
close
the
gates
at
last
the
young
officer
watching
her
became
certain
that
something
was
the
matter
and
he
urged
his
commander
to
see
the
girl
again
major
gladwin
at
once
called
the
girl
to
him
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
why
are
you
so
sad
still
she
would
not
speak
then
the
major
talked
to
her
kindly
promising
that
whatever
her
secret
was
it
would
be
safe
with
him
and
that
he
would
never
betray
her
so
at
length
the
indian
girl
spoke
the
indians
mean
to
kill
you
all
she
whispered
the
braves
have
filed
off
the
ends
of
their
gun
barrels
so
that
the
guns
can
be
hidden
beneath
their
blankets
tomorrow
pontiac
will
come
with
many
warriors
and
will
ask
to
hold
a
council
within
the
fort
he
will
make
a
speech
and
offer
you
a
peace
belt
of
wampum
at
the
end
of
the
speech
he
will
turn
the
belt
round
that
will
be
the
signal
the
chiefs
will
then
spring
up
draw
the
guns
from
their
hiding
places
and
kill
you
all
indians
outside
will
kill
all
your
soldiers
not
one
of
you
will
escape
so
saying
the
girl
went
sadly
away
gladwin
at
once
called
his
officers
and
told
them
what
he
had
heard
they
were
convinced
now
that
evil
was
afoot
and
all
night
they
kept
watch
lest
the
indians
should
change
their
minds
and
make
their
attack
during
the
night
but
the
night
passed
peacefully
when
morning
came
a
great
many
indians
were
seen
to
be
gathered
about
the
fort
and
at
ten
pontiac
followed
by
his
chiefs
entered
the
gateway
they
stalked
in
proudly
garbed
in
all
the
glory
of
savage
splendours
they
were
cloaked
in
bright
coloured
blankets
and
hung
about
with
beads
and
their
heads
were
decorated
with
eagle
feathers
and
their
faces
hideously
painted
pontiac
came
first
and
as
he
passed
beneath
the
gateway
he
started
and
drew
a
sharp
deep
breath
for
both
sides
of
the
narrow
street
were
lined
with
soldiers
gun
in
hand
he
had
been
betrayed
yet
the
haughty
chiefs
made
no
sign
in
silence
they
stalked
on
not
a
muscle
of
their
faces
moving
here
and
there
as
they
passed
on
they
saw
traders
standing
about
in
groups
every
man
fully
armed
not
a
woman
or
child
was
to
be
seen
at
length
the
indians
reached
the
council
hall
here
they
found
the
commander
seated
awaiting
them
surrounded
by
his
officers
they
too
were
armed
for
every
man
of
them
wore
a
sword
by
his
side
and
a
brace
of
pistols
in
his
belt
ill
at
ease
now
the
indians
gazed
at
each
other
in
doubt
what
to
do
then
pontiac
spoke
why
he
asked
do
i
see
so
many
of
my
braves
standing
in
the
street
with
their
guns
because
i
exercise
my
soldiers
replied
gladwin
calmly
for
the
good
of
their
health
and
also
to
keep
discipline
this
answer
made
the
indians
still
more
uneasy
but
after
some
hesitation
they
all
sat
down
on
the
floor
then
with
due
ceremony
pontiac
rose
and
holding
the
belt
of
peace
in
his
hand
began
to
speak
his
words
were
fair
they
had
come
he
said
to
tell
of
their
love
for
the
english
to
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
and
make
the
bonds
of
friendship
closer
as
he
spoke
his
false
and
cunning
words
the
officers
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
him
would
he
give
the
signal
or
not
they
asked
themselves
he
raised
the
belt
at
that
moment
gladwin
made
a
quick
slight
signal
immediately
from
the
passage
with
out
came
the
sound
of
grounding
arms
and
the
of
a
drum
pontiac
stood
rigid
as
one
turned
to
stone
then
after
a
moment
deathly
silence
he
sat
down
in
the
silence
gladwin
sat
looking
steadily
and
fearlessly
at
the
indians
then
he
replied
shortly
to
pontiac
fine
speech
the
friendship
of
the
british
should
be
theirs
he
said
so
long
as
they
deserved
it
the
council
was
at
an
end
the
gates
of
the
fort
which
had
been
closed
were
now
thrown
open
again
and
the
savages
balked
in
their
treachery
stalked
back
to
their
wigwams
but
pontiac
was
not
yet
beaten
and
again
he
tried
to
master
the
fort
by
treachery
and
when
he
found
the
gates
of
the
fort
shut
against
him
his
rage
was
terrible
then
seeing
they
could
not
win
fort
detroit
by
treachery
the
indians
attacked
it
in
force
but
in
spite
of
all
his
horde
of
warriors
in
spite
of
all
his
wiles
pontiac
could
not
take
the
fort
although
he
besieged
it
for
a
whole
year
meanwhile
the
savages
the
whole
country
and
every
other
fort
save
fort
pitt
and
fort
niagara
fell
into
their
hands
more
often
than
not
they
won
their
way
into
the
forts
by
treachery
and
having
entered
they
slew
without
mercy
men
women
and
children
at
michilimackinac
the
redskins
invited
the
officers
and
soldiers
to
watch
a
game
of
ball
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
nearly
all
the
soldiers
stood
about
watching
while
the
indians
with
piercing
yells
dashed
madly
hither
and
thither
after
the
ball
crowds
of
indians
also
looked
on
among
them
many
squaws
wrapped
in
coloured
blankets
the
game
was
played
just
outside
the
fort
the
gates
stood
open
and
most
of
the
soldiers
had
strolled
out
without
their
weapons
to
watch
suddenly
the
ball
flew
through
the
air
and
landed
close
to
the
gate
of
the
fort
there
was
a
mad
rush
after
it
as
they
ran
the
indians
snatched
the
hatchets
and
knives
which
till
now
the
squaws
had
hidden
beneath
their
blankets
screams
of
delight
were
changed
to
war
cries
the
two
officers
who
stood
by
the
gate
were
seized
and
carried
away
prisoner
while
the
rabble
stormed
into
the
fort
slaying
and
robbing
at
will
every
one
of
the
british
was
either
killed
or
taken
prisoner
but
the
french
were
left
alone
thus
all
the
land
was
filled
with
bloodshed
and
horror
there
was
no
safety
anywhere
in
every
bush
an
indian
might
lurk
and
night
was
made
terrible
with
bloodcurdling
war
cries
for
nearly
three
years
the
war
lasted
but
by
degrees
pontiac
saw
that
his
cause
was
lost
the
french
did
not
help
him
as
he
had
expected
they
would
some
of
his
followers
deserted
and
other
tribes
refused
to
join
him
and
at
last
he
saw
himself
forced
to
make
peace
so
there
were
flowery
speeches
and
the
exchange
of
wampum
belts
and
peace
was
made
then
pontiac
army
melted
away
like
snow
in
summer
and
the
great
chief
himself
retired
to
the
forest
to
live
among
his
children
and
his
squaws
a
few
years
later
he
was
traitorously
slain
by
one
of
his
own
people
part

stories
of
the
struggle

liberty
chapter
the
boston
tea
party
all
these
wars
which
had
been
fought
on
american
soil
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
many
lives
now
it
seemed
to
the
british
government
that
the
best
way
to
be
sure
of
peace
in
the
future
was
to
keep
an
army
in
america
they
decided
to
do
this
they
also
decided
that
america
should
pay
for
the
army
and
in
order
to
raise
the
money
a
stamp
tax
was
to
be
introduced
newspapers
marriage
licenses
wills
and
all
sorts
of
legal
papers
were
henceforth
to
be
printed
on
stamped
paper
the
price
of
stamps
varying
according
to
the
importance
of
the
paper
from
a
few
pence
to
as
many
pounds
but
when
the
americans
heard
that
this
act
had
been
passed
without
their
consent
they
were
angry
no
they
said
to
the
british
government
you
can
not
tax
us
without
our
consent
it
is
one
of
the
foundations
of
british
freedom
that
those
who
pay
the
tax
must
also
consent
to
it
we
are
not
represented
in
the
british
parliament
our
consent
has
not
been
asked
and
we
deny
your
right
to
tax
us
the
whole
country
was
filled
with
clamour
in
every
colony
young
men
banded
themselves
together
calling
themselves
sons
of
liberty
and
determined
to
resist
the
tax
no
taxation
without
representation
was
the
cry
when
the
first
boxes
of
stamps
arrived
they
were
seized
and
destroyed
newspapers
appeared
with
a
skull
and
crossbones
printed
where
the
stamp
should
have
been
there
were
riots
and
mass
meetings
everywhere
the
americans
did
not
merely
resist
they
resisted
in
a
body
nothing
but
the
idea
that
their
liberty
was
in
danger
made
them
act
together
over
everything
else
they
had
been
divided
over
that
they
were
united
there
ought
to
be
no
new
england
men
no
new
yorkers
known
on
the
continent
said
one
man
but
all
of
us
americans
even
in
britain
there
were
people
who
thought
this
stamp
act
was
a
mistake
the
great
pitt
had
been
ill
when
it
was
passed
into
law
but
when
he
returned
to
parliament
he
spoke
strongly
against
it
i
was
ill
in
bed
he
said
but
if
i
could
have
been
carried
here
in
my
bed
i
would
have
asked
some
kind
friend
to
lay
my
on
this
floor
so
that
i
might
have
spoken
against
it
it
is
a
subject
of
greater
importance
than
ever
engaged
the
attention
of
this
house
that
subject
always
excepted
when
nearly
a
century
ago
it
was
the
question
whether
you
yourselves
were
to
be
bond
or
free
pitt
was
thinking
of
the
time
when
englishmen
strove
with
charles
i
he
gloried
in
british
liberty
and
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
britons
oppressing
britons
who
that
has
an
english
heart
he
once
said
can
ever
be
weary
of
asserting
liberty
i
rejoice
that
america
has
resisted
he
said
later
there
were
many
against
pitt
but
he
won
the
day
and
the
stamp
act
was
repealed
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
america
and
the
matter
seemed
at
an
end
but
the
very
next
year
a
new
bill
for
taxing
the
americans
was
brought
into
parliament
this
time
the
tax
was
to
be
paid
on
tea
glass
lead
and
a
few
other
things
brought
into
the
country
once
again
the
colonies
were
ablaze
and
they
refused
to
pay
this
duty
just
as
they
had
refused
to
pay
the
stamp
tax
everywhere
there
were
indignation
meetings
but
boston
seemed
to
be
the
heart
of
the
storm
and
to
boston
british
troops
were
sent
to
keep
order
the
soldiers
had
nothing
to
do
but
the
very
sight
of
their
red
coats
made
the
colonists
angry
they
taunted
the
soldiers
and
worried
them
every
way
they
knew
and
the
soldiers
were
not
slow
to
reply
so
at
last
after
eighteen
months
of
bickering
one
march
evening
it
came
to
blows
two
or
three
exasperated
soldiers
fired
upon
the
crowd
of
citizens
five
of
whom
were
killed
and
several
others
wounded
this
was
afterwards
known
as
the
boston
massacre
it
made
the
people
terribly
angry
and
next
day
a
great
meeting
was
held
in
old
south
church
at
this
meeting
the
people
demanded
that
the
troops
should
be
at
once
removed
from
the
town
and
seeing
the
temper
of
the
people
the
lieutenant
governor
withdrew
them
that
same
day
to
a
little
island
in
the
harbour
and
now
finding
how
useless
it
was
to
try
to
force
taxes
on
unwilling
subjects
the
government
removed
all
the
taxes
except
one
king
george
wanted
to
show
his
power
he
wanted
to
prove
to
the
americans
that
he
had
the
right
to
tax
them
if
he
liked
so
he
insisted
that
there
should
still
be
a
tax
on
tea
the
king
will
have
it
so
he
means
to
try
the
question
with
america
said
lord
north
the
stupid
minister
who
was
now
in
power
but
to
prove
that
neither
the
king
nor
any
one
else
had
the
right
to
tax
them
without
their
consent
was
exactly
for
what
the
americans
were
fighting
to
them
one
tax
was
as
bad
as
a
dozen
it
was
not
a
question
of
money
but
a
question
of
right
or
wrong
of
freedom
or
slavery
so
they
refused
to
pay
the
tax
on
tea
they
refused
to
buy
tea
from
britain
at
all
and
smuggled
it
from
holland
ships
laden
with
tea
came
to
port
and
it
was
landed
but
no
one
would
buy
it
and
it
rotted
and
mouldered
in
the
cellars
in
boston
however
the
people
determined
that
it
should
not
even
land
and
when
three
ships
laden
with
tea
came
into
boston
harbour
the
people
refused
to
allow
them
to
unload
take
your
tea
back
again
to
england
they
said
to
the
captain
but
the
captain
could
not
do
that
for
the
customs
officers
would
not
allow
him
to
leave
until
he
had
landed
his
cargo
the
people
were
greatly
excited
large
meetings
were
held
and
every
possible
manner
of
getting
rid
of
the
tea
was
discussed
but
at
length
some
of
the
younger
men
grew
tired
of
talk
time
was
passing
if
something
were
not
done
the
tea
would
be
landed
by
force
that
these
bold
young
men
determined
should
not
be
so
about
fifty
of
them
dressed
themselves
as
red
indians
staining
their
faces
brown
and
painting
them
hideously
then
tomahawk
in
hand
they
stole
silently
down
to
the
ships
and
uttering
wild
war
cries
sprang
on
board
they
seized
the
tea
chests
and
with
their
hatchets
burst
them
open
and
poured
the
tea
into
the
harbour
there
were
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
chests
and
soon
the
harbour
was
black
with
tea
it
was
terrible
waste
but
no
one
stopped
it
from
the
shore
people
looked
on
quietly
and
when
the
work
was
done
the
red
indians
vanished
away
as
silently
as
they
had
come
this
was
afterwards
called
the
boston
tea
party
certainly
no
greater
brewing
of
tea
has
ever
been
known
when
george
iii
heard
of
the
boston
tea
party
he
was
very
angry
and
he
resolved
to
punish
the
people
of
boston
they
will
be
lions
he
said
as
long
as
we
are
lambs
but
if
we
show
them
that
we
mean
to
be
firm
they
will
soon
prove
very
meek
so
he
closed
the
port
and
forbade
any
ships
to
go
there
thus
cutting
off
boston
from
the
trade
of
the
world
he
also
said
that
boston
should
no
longer
be
the
capital
of
massachusetts
and
made
salem
the
capital
instead
boston
of
course
was
ruined
by
these
acts
but
instead
of
looking
coldly
on
her
misfortunes
the
other
colonies
rallied
to
her
aid
and
grain
cattle
and
all
sorts
of
merchandise
poured
into
boston
from
them
boston
could
not
be
starved
neither
could
it
be
frightened
into
submitting
chapter
paul
revere
ride
the
unsheathing
of
the
sword
all
the
colonies
now
felt
that
they
must
unite
in
truth
and
that
they
must
have
some
centre
to
which
all
could
appeal
so
a
congress
of
all
the
colonies
was
called
at
philadelphia
this
is
called
the
first
continental
congress
and
to
it
all
the
colonies
except
georgia
sent
delegates
this
congress
drew
up
a
declaration
of
rights
they
also
sent
an
address
to
the
king
in
which
they
declared
that
they
had
no
wish
to
separate
from
britain
but
the
king
called
the
congress
an
unlawful
and
seditious
gathering
and
would
not
listen
to
anything
it
had
to
say
still
statesmen
with
pitt
at
their
head
struggled
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
i
contend
not
for
indulgence
but
for
justice
to
america
he
said
the
americans
are
a
brave
generous
and
united
people
with
arms
in
their
hands
and
courage
in
their
hearts
it
is
not
repealing
this
act
of
parliament
it
is
not
repealing
a
piece
of
parchment
that
can
restore
america
to
our
bosom
you
must
repeal
her
fears
and
her
resentments
and
you
may
then
hope
for
her
love
and
gratitude
but
few
people
listened
to
pitt
the
bill
which
he
brought
into
parliament
was
rejected
with
scorn
and
the
great
struggle
which
was
to
last
for
eight
years
began
already
in
america
men
minds
had
begun
to
turn
to
war
and
on
every
village
green
the
farmers
might
be
seen
drilling
every
evening
bands
of
minute
men
that
is
men
who
would
be
ready
at
a
notice
were
organised
all
sorts
of
war
stores
were
gathered
two
of
the
leaders
of
the
people
in
all
these
matters
were
samuel
adams
and
john
hancock
these
men
governor
gage
who
was
also
commander
of
the
troops
was
ordered
to
arrest
and
send
to
england
to
be
tried
as
traitors
gage
having
heard
that
both
men
were
staying
at
the
village
of
lexington
decided
to
arrest
them
together
for
this
he
carefully
laid
his
plans
eight
hundred
men
were
to
leave
boston
in
secret
at
dead
of
night
first
they
were
to
go
to
lexington
and
having
arrested
the
traitors
they
were
next
to
march
on
to
concord
to
seize
the
large
war
stores
which
were
known
to
be
gathered
there
all
the
preparations
were
made
as
silently
and
as
secretly
as
possible
but
the
colonists
were
on
the
alert
they
knew
that
something
was
afoot
and
guessed
what
it
was
on
the
of
april
gage
gave
strict
orders
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
to
leave
boston
that
night
but
no
orders
could
stop
determined
men
and
as
the
moon
was
rising
a
little
boat
was
rowed
across
the
charles
river
almost
under
the
shadow
of
the
british
the
boat
reached
the
farther
shore
and
a
man
booted
and
spurred
and
if
ready
for
a
long
ride
leaped
out
upon
the
bank
this
man
was
paul
revere
at
ten
the
troops
also
were
silently
rowed
across
the
charles
river
and
in
the
darkness
set
out
for
lexington
but
not
far
off
on
the
bank
of
the
same
river
a
man
stood
waiting
beside
a
saddled
horse
quietly
he
waited
looking
always
towards
the
tower
of
the
old
north
church
it
was
paul
revere
and
he
waited
for
a
signal
to
tell
him
which
way
the
red
coats
were
going
suddenly
about
eleven
two
twinkling
lights
appeared
upon
the
tower
and
without
a
moment
loss
paul
revere
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
dashed
away
swiftly
he
rode
urging
his
good
horse
onward
with
voice
and
hand
near
the
lonely
spot
where
stood
the
gallows
he
passed
here
under
a
tree
two
horsemen
waited
and
as
revere
came
nearer
he
saw
that
they
were
british
soldiers
swiftly
they
darted
at
him
one
tried
to
seize
his
bridle
the
other
to
head
him
off
but
revere
was
a
fearless
rider
and
knew
the
countryside
by
heart
he
swerved
suddenly
doubled
and
was
soon
clear
of
his
pursuers
then
on
through
the
darkness
he
galloped
unhindered
till
he
reached
medford
here
he
stayed
but
to
rouse
the
captain
of
the
minute
men
and
onward
he
sped
once
more
now
at
the
door
of
every
cottage
or
farmhouse
which
he
passed
he
loudly
knocked
shouting
his
news
the
soldiers
are
coming
and
thundered
off
again
in
the
darkness
a
little
after
midnight
he
reached
lexington
and
stopped
before
the
house
where
adams
and
hancock
were
sleeping
he
found
it
guarded
by
minute
men
and
as
he
excitedly
shouted
his
news
they
bade
him
be
quiet
do
make
such
a
noise
said
the
sergeant
you
will
waken
the
people
in
the
house
noise
cried
revere
you
will
soon
have
noise
enough
the
regulars
are
coming
hancock
was
awake
and
hearing
revere
voice
he
threw
up
his
window
shouting
to
the
guard
to
let
him
in
so
revere
went
into
the
house
and
told
all
he
knew
when
they
heard
the
news
hancock
wanted
to
stay
and
fight
if
fighting
there
was
to
be
but
the
others
would
not
hear
of
it
so
as
day
dawned
the
two
men
quietly
walked
away
and
were
soon
on
the
road
to
philadelphia
meanwhile
the
british
troops
were
steadily
marching
nearer
and
nearer
at
first
all
was
silent
save
the
clatter
and
jingle
of
their
arms
and
the
tramp
of
their
feet
there
was
no
sound
no
light
was
to
be
seen
far
or
near
then
suddenly
a
bell
rang
a
shout
was
heard
lights
twinkled
here
and
there
the
night
was
no
longer
silent
and
dark
the
country
was
no
longer
asleep
the
colonel
in
command
of
the
troops
grew
anxious
he
had
expected
to
take
the
people
completely
by
surprise
and
he
had
done
so
somehow
the
secret
had
leaked
out
the
whole
countryside
was
up
and
awake
and
fearing
lest
with
his
small
company
of
soldiers
he
would
not
be
able
to
do
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
he
sent
back
to
boston
for
more
men
and
sure
enough
his
fears
were
well
founded
for
when
in
the
cold
grey
of
early
dawn
the
advance
party
reached
lexington
they
found
a
little
guard
of
sixty
or
seventy
armed
men
drawn
up
to
receive
them
disperse
ye
rebels
disperse
shouted
the
commander
as
he
rode
towards
them
but
the
men
stood
motionless
and
silent
why
do
you
disperse
you
villains
he
cried
again
then
seeing
words
had
no
effect
he
gave
the
order
to
fire
the
soldiers
obeyed
and
eight
minute
men
fell
dead
and
several
more
were
wounded
the
minute
men
returned
the
fire
but
just
then
more
british
soldiers
appeared
in
sight
and
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
resist
so
great
a
force
the
americans
dispersed
thus
the
terrible
war
which
was
almost
a
civil
war
began
the
british
now
marched
on
to
concord
they
had
failed
to
arrest
the
men
they
had
been
sent
to
arrest
at
lexington
so
there
was
all
the
more
reason
to
hurry
on
to
concord
and
seize
the
war
stores
before
there
was
time
to
spirit
them
away
but
when
about
seven
in
the
morning
the
troops
arrived
at
concord
the
stores
for
the
most
part
had
been
already
safely
hidden
a
gun
or
two
they
found
and
a
few
barrels
of
flour
the
guns
were
spiked
the
barrels
staved
in
the
court
house
set
on
fire
but
meanwhile
the
minute
men
had
been
gathering
and
now
a
force
four
hundred
strong
appeared
on
the
further
side
of
a
bridge
known
as
the
north
bridge
the
bridge
was
held
by
two
hundred
british
and
when
they
saw
the
minute
men
approach
they
began
to
destroy
it
there
was
a
sharp
exchange
of
fire
then
the
minute
men
charged
across
the
narrow
bridge
sweeping
all
before
them
the
british
fled
back
to
the
village
and
the
minute
men
hardly
knowing
what
they
had
done
retired
again
across
the
bridge
and
waited
the
british
leader
now
decided
to
return
to
boston
he
had
done
nothing
which
he
had
set
out
to
do
but
he
saw
this
his
position
was
one
of
great
danger
everywhere
he
was
surrounded
with
enemies
his
men
were
hungry
and
worn
out
so
about
twelve
the
march
back
to
boston
began
but
the
return
was
not
easy
for
all
the
way
the
troops
were
harassed
by
the
americans
every
bush
every
wall
concealed
an
armed
farmer
whose
aim
was
deadly
and
sure
man
after
man
fell
and
beneath
the
constant
and
galling
fire
coming
it
seemed
from
everywhere
and
nowhere
the
nerves
of
the
wearied
hungry
men
gave
way
faster
and
faster
the
long
red
line
swept
along
in
every
growing
confusion
there
was
no
thought
now
of
anything
but
safety
and
the
march
was
almost
a
rout
when
at
length
the
reinforcements
from
boston
appeared
these
were
a
thousand
strong
and
their
leader
lord
percy
seeing
the
confusion
and
distress
of
the
british
formed
his
men
into
a
hollow
square
into
this
refuge
the
fugitives
fled
throwing
themselves
upon
the
ground
in
utter
exhaustion
with
their
tongues
hanging
out
of
their
mouths
like
those
of
dogs
after
a
chase
lord
percy
had
brought
cannons
with
him
so
with
these
he
swept
the
field
and
for
a
time
forced
the
colonists
to
retire
but
they
did
not
disperse
they
still
hovered
near
and
as
soon
as
the
retreat
again
began
there
began
with
it
the
constant
galling
fire
from
every
tree
or
bush
before
behind
on
either
side
to
return
the
fire
was
useless
as
the
enemy
were
hidden
it
was
a
sort
of
warfare
not
unlike
that
which
braddock
had
had
to
meet
a
sort
of
warfare
in
which
the
american
farmer
was
skilled
but
of
which
the
british
soldier
knew
nothing
so
when
at
length
as
day
darkened
the
british
troops
reached
boston
they
were
utterly
spent
and
weary
and
in
a
huddled
disorganised
crowd
they
hurried
into
shelter
chapter
the
first
battle
of
bunker
hill
the
sword
was
at
length
unsheathed
there
was
no
more
doubt
about
it
there
was
to
be
a
war
between
the
mother
country
and
her
daughter
states
and
now
far
and
wide
throughout
the
colonies
the
call
to
arms
was
heard
and
answered
farmers
left
their
ploughs
and
seized
their
rifles
trappers
forsook
their
hunting
grounds
traders
left
their
business
and
hastened
to
join
the
army
john
stark
a
bold
trapper
learned
in
indian
ways
and
famous
in
indian
warfare
marched
from
new
hampshire
at
the
head
of
several
hundred
men
israel
putnam
more
famous
still
for
his
deeds
of
daring
in
the
indian
wars
came
too
he
was
busy
on
his
farm
at
pomfret
connecticut
when
the
news
of
the
fight
at
lexington
reached
him
he
was
already
a
man
of
but
there
and
then
he
left
his
work
and
hastened
round
the
neighbouring
farms
calling
out
the
militia
then
commanding
them
to
follow
him
with
all
speed
he
mounted
his
horse
and
turned
its
head
towards
cambridge
hour
after
hour
throughout
the
night
he
rode
onward
and
as
day
dawned
on
the
of
april
he
galloped
into
cambridge
having
ridden
a
hundred
miles
in
eighteen
hours
without
a
change
of
horse
handsome
young
captain
benedict
arnold
half
sailor
half
merchant
gathered
his
men
on
new
haven
green
and
when
the
general
of
militia
bade
him
wait
for
regular
orders
and
refused
to
supply
him
with
ammunition
for
his
men
he
threatened
to
break
open
the
magazine
if
the
ammunition
was
not
forthcoming
at
once
so
seeing
that
nothing
would
restrain
him
the
general
yielded
and
arnold
gallant
and
gay
with
sixty
men
behind
him
marched
for
cambridge
thus
day
by
day
men
of
all
classes
and
of
all
ages
poured
in
from
the
countryside
until
an
army
of
sixteen
thousand
was
gathered
around
boston
meetings
too
were
held
throughout
the
country
when
patriots
urged
the
need
of
arming
and
fighting
in
the
virginian
convention
patrick
henry
the
great
orator
thrilled
his
hearers
with
his
fiery
eloquence
we
must
fight
he
cried
i
repeat
it
we
must
fight
an
appeal
to
arms
and
to
the
god
of
hosts
is
all
that
is
left
us
brilliantly
convincingly
he
spoke
and
ended
with
the
unforgettable
words
is
life
so
dear
or
peace
so
sweet
as
to
be
purchased
at
the
price
of
chains
and
slavery
forbid
it
almighty
god
i
know
not
what
course
others
may
take
but
as
for
me
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
his
last
exclamation
said
one
who
heard
him
was
like
the
shout
of
the
leader
who
turns
back
the
rout
of
battle
but
even
yet
the
leaders
of
the
country
hoped
to
avoid
a
war
the
second
continental
congress
met
at
philadelphia
on
the
of
may
and
the
members
talked
anxiously
of
ways
and
means
to
restore
peace
but
it
was
already
too
late
for
the
gathered
army
was
no
longer
to
be
restrained
and
the
very
day
upon
which
congress
met
a
british
fortress
had
been
seized
by
the
colonists
the
chain
of
lakes
and
rivers
connecting
the
hudson
with
the
lawrence
was
felt
to
be
of
great
importance
to
the
colonists
for
if
britain
had
control
of
it
it
would
cut
the
colonies
in
two
and
stop
intercourse
between
new
england
and
the
south
it
would
also
give
the
british
an
easy
route
by
which
to
bring
troops
and
supplies
from
canada
among
those
who
felt
the
importance
of
this
route
was
benedict
arnold
and
the
day
after
he
arrived
at
cambridge
he
laid
his
ideas
before
the
massachusetts
committee
of
safety
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
attack
the
forts
guarding
this
waterway
his
request
was
granted
he
was
given
the
rank
of
colonel
and
authority
to
raise
a
company
of
four
hundred
men
for
the
purpose
arnold
set
out
at
once
but
he
soon
found
that
he
was
not
first
in
the
field
for
the
people
of
connecticut
too
had
felt
the
value
of
this
waterway
and
ethan
allen
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
volunteers
who
went
by
the
name
of
green
mountain
boys
had
set
out
for
the
same
purpose
these
green
mountain
boys
took
their
name
from
the
district
of
vermont
which
means
green
mountain
that
district
under
the
name
of
new
hampshire
grants
had
been
claimed
by
new
york
colony
but
the
green
mountain
boys
had
resisted
the
claim
and
by
force
of
arms
proved
their
right
to
be
considered
a
separate
colony
thus
having
settled
their
own
little
revolution
they
were
now
ready
to
take
part
in
the
great
one
at
castleton
vermont
arnold
met
ethan
allen
and
his
men
and
claimed
the
leadership
of
the
expedition
but
the
green
mountain
boys
scouted
the
idea
they
would
fight
under
their
own
leader
or
not
fight
at
all
they
said
and
as
arnold
had
gathered
very
few
of
his
four
hundred
men
he
had
to
give
way
so
instead
of
leading
the
expedition
he
joined
it
as
a
volunteer
this
matter
settled
the
little
company
marched
on
to
lake
champlain
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
they
arrived
at
the
southern
end
opposite
fort
ticonderoga
here
the
lake
is
hardly
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
and
the
men
began
at
once
to
row
across
but
they
had
only
two
or
three
boats
and
when
day
began
to
dawn
only
about
eighty
men
had
got
over
with
these
allen
decided
to
attack
for
he
feared
if
he
waited
till
daylight
that
the
garrison
would
be
awake
and
would
no
doubt
resist
stubbornly
so
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
his
men
with
arnold
beside
him
he
marched
quickly
and
silently
up
the
hill
to
the
gateway
of
the
fort
when
the
astonished
sentinel
saw
this
body
of
men
creeping
out
of
the
morning
dusk
he
fired
at
their
leader
but
his
gun
missed
fire
and
he
fled
into
the
fort
after
him
dashed
the
colonists
uttering
a
loud
indian
yell
as
they
reached
the
parade
ground
within
the
fort
the
garrison
which
consisted
of
about
forty
men
was
completely
taken
by
surprise
and
yielded
with
little
resistance
they
allen
marched
to
the
door
of
the
commandment
quarters
and
striking
three
blows
upon
it
with
his
sword
hilt
commanded
him
to
come
forth
and
surrender
as
allen
struck
the
door
was
flung
open
and
half
dressed
and
half
awake
the
commandment
appeared
in
whose
name
he
demanded
do
you
order
me
to
surrender
in
the
name
of
the
great
jehovah
and
the
continental
congress
thundered
allen
really
the
continental
congress
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
the
commandment
could
not
know
that
but
he
had
only
to
look
about
him
to
see
that
the
fort
was
already
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
so
seeing
no
help
for
it
he
yielded
and
all
his
great
stores
of
cannon
and
ammunition
were
sent
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
new
england
army
two
days
after
this
crown
point
further
down
the
lake
was
also
seized
for
it
was
only
guarded
by
twelve
men
here
a
small
ship
was
found
and
arnold
chance
to
lead
came
for
he
was
a
sailor
and
going
on
board
with
his
own
men
he
made
a
dash
for
at
the
northern
end
of
the
lake
when
he
was
about
thirty
miles
from
the
fort
the
wind
dropped
and
his
ship
lay
rocking
idly
on
the
water
arnold
however
was
not
the
man
to
be
easily
beaten
he
had
boats
enough
to
carry
thirty
men
and
with
these
he
set
off
to
row
to
the
fort
all
night
the
men
bent
to
the
oars
and
at
six
in
the
morning
they
reached
john
once
more
the
fort
was
easily
taken
for
here
too
there
were
no
more
than
twelve
men
arnold
however
was
only
just
in
time
for
he
learned
from
his
prisoners
that
troops
were
expected
from
canada
he
felt
therefore
that
john
was
no
safe
place
for
him
and
his
little
band
of
thirty
so
he
seized
a
small
ship
which
lay
in
the
harbour
sank
everything
else
in
the
shape
of
a
boat
and
made
off
and
when
the
canadian
troops
arrived
next
day
they
found
the
fort
deserted
alike
by
friend
and
foe
and
the
boats
which
should
have
carried
them
on
their
way
to
ticonderoga
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
by
these
quick
bold
attacks
the
control
of
the
great
waterway
was
for
a
time
at
least
in
the
hands
of
the
colonists
it
was
moreover
rendered
useless
to
the
british
for
their
boats
being
destroyed
they
had
no
means
of
transporting
soldiers
southwards
until
new
boats
could
be
built
this
caused
a
long
delay
a
delay
very
useful
to
the
colonists
in
the
meantime
allen
was
appointed
commandment
of
ticonderoga
and
arnold
with
a
little
soreness
at
his
heart
returned
to
cambridge
he
had
been
appointed
leader
of
the
expedition
but
had
been
forced
to
join
it
as
a
volunteer
under
another
leader
his
knowledge
and
dash
had
crowned
the
expedition
with
success
but
another
received
the
rewards
and
praise
when
however
the
continental
congress
heard
what
had
been
done
it
was
rather
taken
aback
it
was
not
at
all
sure
at
first
whether
it
was
a
case
for
rewards
or
reprimands
for
it
was
still
vainly
hoping
for
peace
so
it
ordered
that
an
exact
list
of
all
cannon
and
supplies
which
had
been
captured
should
be
made
in
order
that
they
might
be
given
back
to
the
mother
country
when
the
restoration
of
the
former
harmony
between
great
britain
and
these
colonies
shall
render
it
prudent
and
consistent
meanwhile
the
new
army
grew
daily
larger
it
was
still
almost
entirely
made
up
of
new
englanders
but
it
was
now
called
the
continental
army
and
the
continental
congress
appointed
george
washington
to
be
washington
was
now
a
tall
handsome
man
little
over
forty
he
was
as
modest
as
he
was
brave
and
he
accepted
the
great
honour
and
heavy
duties
laid
upon
him
with
something
of
dread
since
the
congress
desire
it
he
said
i
will
enter
upon
this
momentous
duty
and
exert
every
power
i
possess
in
their
service
but
i
beg
it
may
be
remembered
by
every
gentleman
in
this
room
that
i
this
day
declare
with
the
utmost
sincerity
i
do
not
think
myself
equal
to
the
command
i
am
honoured
with
meantime
things
had
not
been
standing
still
while
congress
had
been
choosing
a
the
army
had
been
fighting
by
this
time
too
new
troops
had
come
out
from
england
and
the
british
force
was
now
ten
thousand
strong
feeling
sure
that
the
americans
would
not
stand
against
such
a
force
governor
gage
issued
a
proclamation
offering
pardon
to
all
who
would
lay
down
their
arms
except
samuel
adams
and
john
hancock
these
two
he
said
were
too
bad
to
be
forgiven
instead
they
prepared
to
take
possession
of
the
hills
commanding
boston
it
was
at
bunker
hill
that
the
first
real
battle
of
the
war
was
fought
for
lexington
had
after
all
been
a
mere
skirmish
only
of
importance
because
it
was
the
first
in
this
long
and
deadly
war
the
forts
on
lake
champlain
had
been
taken
without
the
shedding
of
blood
the
battle
is
called
bunker
hill
although
it
was
really
fought
on
breed
hill
which
is
quite
close
the
mistake
of
the
name
was
made
because
the
americans
had
been
sent
to
take
possession
of
bunker
hill
but
instead
took
possession
of
breed
hill
it
was
during
the
night
that
the
americans
took
up
their
position
on
the
hill
and
when
day
dawned
and
the
british
saw
them
there
they
determined
to
dislodge
them
and
the
battle
began
up
the
hill
the
british
charged
with
splendid
courage
only
to
be
met
and
driven
back
by
a
withering
fire
from
the
american
rifles
their
front
riles
were
mowed
down
and
the
hillside
was
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
but
again
and
yet
again
they
came
on
at
the
third
charge
they
reached
the
top
for
the
americans
had
used
up
all
their
ammunition
and
could
fire
no
longer
still
they
would
not
yield
and
there
was
a
fierce
hand
to
hand
fight
before
the
americans
were
driven
from
their
trenches
and
the
hill
was
in
possession
of
the
british
for
the
british
it
was
a
hard
won
victory
for
they
lost
nearly
three
times
as
many
men
as
the
americans
among
them
some
gallant
officers
as
to
the
americans
in
spite
of
their
defeat
they
rejoiced
for
they
knew
now
what
they
could
do
they
knew
they
could
stand
up
to
the
famous
british
regulars
and
now
as
washington
rode
towards
charleston
to
take
command
of
the
army
news
of
this
battle
was
brought
to
him
did
our
men
fight
asked
washington
and
when
he
was
told
how
well
his
grave
face
lighted
up
then
the
liberties
of
the
country
are
safe
he
cried
so
with
hope
in
his
heart
washington
rode
on
and
at
length
after
a
journey
of
eleven
days
reached
cambridge
the
headquarters
of
the
army
the
next
day
the
of
july
the
whole
army
was
drawn
up
upon
the
plain
and
mounted
on
a
splendid
white
horse
washington
rode
to
the
head
of
it
under
a
great
elm
tree
he
wheeled
his
horse
and
drawing
his
sword
solemnly
took
command
of
the
army
of
the
united
colonies
and
as
the
blade
glittered
in
the
sunshine
a
great
shout
went
up
from
the
soldiers
they
were
new
englanders
for
the
most
part
but
they
welcomed
their
virginian
commander
whole
heartedly
for
were
they
not
all
americans
were
they
not
all
ready
to
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
for
the
one
great
cause
but
the
army
of
which
washington
had
taken
command
was
perhaps
the
rawest
worst
equipped
army
which
ever
marched
into
the
field
the
men
had
neither
uniforms
tents
stores
nor
ammunition
many
of
them
had
no
arms
there
was
no
organisation
and
little
discipline
even
the
exact
numbers
composing
this
army
were
not
known
they
were
in
fact
as
one
of
washington
own
officers
said
only
a
gathering
of
brave
enthusiastic
undisciplined
country
lads
but
out
of
this
crowd
of
brave
enthusiastic
men
washington
set
himself
to
make
an
army
fit
to
do
great
deeds
so
he
worked
and
rode
and
wrote
unceasingly
and
unwearyingly
for
he
had
not
only
to
deal
with
the
army
but
with
congress
also
he
had
to
awaken
them
to
the
fact
that
the
country
had
to
do
great
deeds
and
that
to
do
them
well
money
and
a
great
deal
of
money
was
needed
meanwhile
george
iii
also
was
making
free
at
preparations
more
soldiers
he
saw
were
needed
to
subdue
these
rebel
farmers
and
as
it
was
difficult
to
persuade
britons
to
go
to
fight
their
brothers
he
hired
a
lot
of
germans
and
sent
them
out
to
fight
the
americans
nothing
hurt
the
americans
more
than
this
more
than
anything
else
this
act
made
them
long
to
be
independent
after
this
there
was
no
more
talk
of
making
friends
chapter
the
war
in
canada
after
bunker
hill
there
was
a
pause
in
the
fighting
round
boston
which
gave
washington
time
to
get
his
raw
recruits
in
hand
a
little
then
during
the
summer
news
came
that
sir
guy
carleton
the
governor
of
canada
was
making
plans
to
retake
ticonderoga
and
the
colonists
determined
to
invade
canada
general
philip
schuyler
was
given
command
of
the
expedition
and
with
two
thousand
men
he
set
out
for
john
which
arnold
had
taken
but
had
been
unable
to
hold
earlier
in
the
year
this
time
the
colonists
found
john
better
guarded
and
only
at
the
end
of
a
two
months
siege
did
it
yield
by
this
time
schuyler
had
become
ill
and
the
command
was
given
to
general
richard
montgomery
who
crossed
the
lawrence
and
entered
montreal
in
triumph
almost
at
the
same
time
benedict
arnold
set
out
with
twelve
hundred
men
to
attack
quebec
he
marched
through
the
forest
of
maine
then
an
almost
unknown
country
and
uninhabited
save
by
indians
it
was
a
tremendous
march
and
one
that
needed
all
the
grit
and
endurance
of
brave
determined
men
they
climbed
hills
struggled
through
swamps
paddled
across
lakes
and
down
unknown
streams
sometimes
they
waded
up
to
their
knees
in
icy
waters
pushing
their
canoes
before
them
against
the
rapid
current
or
again
they
carried
them
over
long
portages
shouldering
their
way
through
forest
so
dense
that
they
could
scarcely
advance
a
mile
an
hour
at
night
soaked
with
rain
and
sleet
they
slept
upon
the
snowy
ground
their
food
gave
out
and
the
pangs
of
hunger
were
added
to
their
other
miseries
many
died
by
the
way
others
losing
heart
turned
back
but
sick
and
giddy
starving
and
exhausted
the
rest
stumbled
onward
and
at
length
little
more
than
five
hundred
ragged
half
armed
more
than
half
famished
men
reached
the
shores
of
the
lawrence
they
were
a
sorry
little
company
with
which
to
invade
a
vast
province
but
their
courage
was
superb
their
hope
sublime
and
without
delay
they
set
out
to
take
the
great
fortress
which
had
withstood
so
many
sieges
and
had
only
fallen
at
last
before
the
genius
and
daring
of
wolfe
across
the
lawrence
this
little
company
of
intrepid
colonists
paddled
up
the
path
where
wolfe
had
led
his
men
they
climbed
and
stood
at
length
where
they
had
stood
upon
the
heights
of
abraham
they
had
no
cannon
and
half
their
muskets
were
useless
yet
arnold
at
the
head
of
his
spectral
little
company
boldly
summoned
the
town
to
surrender
the
town
did
not
surrender
the
governor
refused
to
come
out
and
fight
so
seeing
the
uselessness
of
his
summons
arnold
marched
away
about
twenty
miles
and
encamped
to
wait
for
montgomery
arrival
from
montreal
he
soon
arrived
but
even
with
hid
men
the
colonists
only
numbered
about
eight
hundred
far
too
small
a
company
with
which
to
besiege
a
fortress
such
as
quebec
still
they
resolved
to
take
the
place
by
storm
it
was
early
on
the
morning
of
the
of
january
that
they
made
the
attempt
in
the
teeth
of
a
blinding
snow
storm
arnold
led
the
assault
on
one
side
of
the
town
montgomery
on
the
other
with
tremendous
dash
and
bravery
the
colonists
carried
the
first
barricades
and
forced
their
way
into
the
town
but
almost
at
the
outset
montgomery
was
killed
a
little
later
arnold
was
sorely
wounded
and
had
to
be
carried
back
to
the
camp
both
leaders
gone
the
heart
went
out
of
the
men
and
they
retreated
leaving
many
prisoners
at
the
hands
of
the
british
the
great
assault
had
failed
but
sick
and
wounded
though
he
was
arnold
did
not
lose
heart
he
still
kept
up
a
show
of
besieging
quebec
i
have
no
thought
of
leaving
this
proud
town
he
said
until
i
first
enter
it
in
triumph
i
am
in
the
way
of
my
duty
and
know
no
fear
but
the
only
chance
of
taking
quebec
was
to
take
it
in
the
winter
while
the
lawrence
was
closed
with
ice
so
that
the
british
ships
could
not
reach
it
with
reinforcements
and
supplies
arnold
therefore
sent
to
washington
begging
for
five
thousand
troops
such
a
number
it
was
impossible
for
washington
to
spare
from
his
little
army
and
only
a
few
reinforcements
were
sent
most
of
whom
reached
arnold
utterly
exhausted
with
their
long
tramp
through
the
pathless
wilderness
smallpox
too
became
rife
in
the
camp
so
although
there
at
length
two
thousand
men
before
quebec
not
more
that
a
thousand
were
fit
for
duty
yet
what
mere
men
could
do
they
did
but
winter
passed
and
quebec
remained
untaken
then
on
april
morning
captain
charles
douglas
arrived
off
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
with
a
fleet
of
british
ships
he
found
the
river
still
packed
with
ice
but
quebec
he
knew
must
be
in
sore
straits
it
was
no
time
for
caution
so
by
way
of
experiment
he
ran
his
flag
ship
full
speed
against
a
mass
of
ice
the
ice
was
shivered
to
pieces
and
the
good
ship
sailed
unharmed
for
nine
days
the
gallant
vessel
ploughed
on
through
fields
of
ice
but
suffering
no
serious
damage
her
captain
having
no
thought
but
to
reach
and
relieve
the
beleaguered
city
his
boldness
was
rewarded
other
vessels
followed
in
his
track
and
at
their
coming
the
colonists
gave
up
their
attempt
to
conquer
canada
and
marched
away
the
attack
on
canada
had
been
an
utter
failure
but
arnold
still
clung
to
the
hope
of
commanding
the
great
waterway
from
the
lawrence
to
the
hudson
at
crown
point
he
began
to
build
ships
and
by
the
end
of
september
had
a
little
fleet
of
nine
the
british
also
busied
themselves
building
ships
and
on
the
of
october
a
fight
between
the
two
fleets
took
place
on
lake
champlain
between
the
island
of
valcour
and
the
mainland
the
british
ships
were
far
larger
and
more
numerous
than
the
american
indeed
in
comparison
with
the
british
the
american
boats
were
mere
cockle
shells
but
the
colonists
put
up
a
gallant
fight
which
lasted
five
hours
and
the
sun
went
down
leaving
them
sadly
shattered
but
still
unbeaten
the
british
commander
however
felt
sure
of
finishing
them
off
in
the
morning
so
he
anchored
his
ships
in
a
line
across
the
southern
end
of
the
channel
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
thus
cutting
off
all
retreat
but
arnold
knew
his
danger
and
determined
to
make
a
dash
for
freedom
the
night
was
dark
and
foggy
the
british
were
so
sure
of
their
prey
that
they
kept
no
watch
so
while
they
slept
one
by
one
the
american
ships
crept
silently
through
their
lines
and
sped
away
when
day
dawned
the
british
with
wrath
and
disgust
saw
an
empty
lake
where
they
had
expected
to
see
a
stricken
foe
they
immediately
gave
chase
and
the
following
day
they
again
came
up
with
the
little
american
fleet
for
many
of
the
ships
were
so
crippled
that
they
could
move
but
slowly
again
a
five
hours
battle
was
fought
one
ship
the
washington
struck
her
flag
but
arnold
in
his
little
congress
fought
doggedly
on
then
seeing
he
could
resist
no
more
he
drove
the
congress
and
four
other
small
boats
ashore
in
a
creek
too
narrow
for
any
but
the
smallest
one
of
the
british
ships
to
follow
here
he
set
them
on
fire
and
bade
his
men
leap
for
the
shore
he
himself
being
the
last
to
leave
the
burning
decks
on
land
he
waited
until
he
was
certain
that
the
ships
were
safe
from
capture
and
that
they
would
go
down
with
their
flags
flying
then
he
marched
off
with
his
men
and
brought
them
all
safely
to
ticonderoga
the
attack
on
canada
had
been
an
utter
failure
the
little
american
fleet
had
been
shattered
save
for
ticonderoga
the
coveted
waterway
was
in
the
hands
of
the
british
had
the
british
commander
known
it
too
he
might
have
attacked
ticonderoga
then
and
there
and
taken
it
with
ease
but
arnold
was
there
and
arnold
had
made
such
a
name
for
himself
by
his
dash
and
courage
that
carleton
did
not
dare
attack
the
fort
and
contenting
himself
for
the
moment
with
having
gained
control
of
lake
champlain
he
turned
to
attack
canada
arnold
had
failed
to
take
quebec
and
he
has
lost
his
little
fleet
but
against
his
failure
to
take
quebec
his
countrymen
put
his
wonderful
march
through
pathless
forest
against
the
loss
of
the
fleet
the
fact
that
but
for
arnold
it
would
never
have
been
built
at
all
so
the
people
cheered
him
as
a
hero
and
washington
looked
upon
him
as
one
of
his
best
officers
but
arnold
temper
was
hot
if
his
head
was
cool
he
was
ambitious
and
somewhat
arrogant
and
while
he
had
been
fighting
so
bravely
he
had
quarreled
with
his
brother
officers
and
made
enemies
of
many
they
declared
that
he
fought
not
for
his
country
honour
but
for
the
glory
of
benedict
arnold
so
it
came
about
that
he
did
not
receive
the
reward
of
promotion
which
he
felt
himself
entitled
to
when
congress
appointed
several
new
major
generals
he
was
passed
over
and
once
again
as
after
the
taking
of
ticonderoga
bitterness
filled
his
heart
chapter
the
birth
of
a
great
nation
while
these
things
were
happening
in
the
north
the
british
had
been
forced
to
march
away
from
boston
at
first
washington
could
do
little
but
keep
his
army
before
the
town
for
he
had
no
siege
guns
with
which
to
bombard
it
nor
had
he
any
desire
to
destroy
the
town
burn
it
said
some
if
that
is
the
only
way
of
driving
out
the
british
even
john
hancock
to
whom
a
great
part
of
boston
belonged
advised
this
burn
boston
he
said
and
make
john
hancock
a
beggar
if
the
public
good
requires
it
but
washington
did
not
attempt
to
burn
it
after
the
taking
of
ticonderoga
and
crown
point
however
he
got
guns
for
many
of
the
cannon
taken
at
these
forts
were
put
on
sledges
and
dragged
over
the
snow
to
boston
it
was
colonel
henry
knox
who
carried
out
this
feat
he
was
a
stout
young
man
with
a
lovely
smile
and
jolly
fat
laugh
who
greatly
enjoyed
a
joke
he
had
been
a
bookseller
before
the
war
turned
him
into
a
soldier
and
now
as
he
felled
trees
and
made
sledges
and
encouraged
his
men
over
the
long
rough
way
he
hugely
enjoyed
the
joke
of
bringing
british
guns
to
bombard
the
british
out
of
boston
when
washington
got
these
guns
he
quietly
one
night
took
possession
of
dorchester
heights
which
commanded
both
boston
town
and
harbour
so
quick
had
been
his
action
that
it
seemed
to
general
howe
the
british
commander
as
if
the
fortifications
on
dorchester
heights
had
been
the
work
of
magic
but
magic
or
no
magic
they
were
he
saw
a
real
and
formidable
danger
with
siege
guns
frowning
above
both
town
and
harbour
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
hold
boston
so
hastily
embarking
his
troops
general
howe
sailed
away
to
halifax
in
nova
scotia
and
boston
was
left
in
peace
for
the
rest
of
the
war
by
this
time
there
had
been
fighting
in
the
south
as
well
as
in
new
england
for
king
george
had
taken
it
into
his
stubborn
head
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
attack
the
southern
colonies
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
war
in
the
north
was
already
more
that
he
could
manage
sir
peter
parker
therefore
was
sent
out
from
england
with
a
fleet
of
about
fifty
ships
and
lord
cornwallis
with
two
thousand
men
to
attack
charleston
in
south
carolina
howe
was
also
ordered
to
send
some
soldiers
southward
and
although
he
could
ill
spare
them
from
boston
he
sent
general
sir
henry
clinton
with
a
small
detachment
according
to
arrangement
the
troops
from
boston
and
england
were
to
attack
together
with
the
loyalists
of
the
south
and
the
friendly
indians
but
everything
was
bungled
the
fleet
the
land
force
the
loyalists
and
the
indians
all
seemed
to
be
pulling
different
ways
and
attacked
at
different
times
the
assault
on
charleston
was
a
miserable
failure
and
to
the
delight
of
the
colonists
the
whole
british
force
sailed
away
to
join
howe
in
the
north
and
for
more
than
two
years
there
was
no
fighting
in
the
southern
colonies
the
commander
of
the
colonists
in
charleston
was
general
charles
lee
he
was
not
really
an
american
at
all
but
an
englishman
a
soldier
of
fortune
and
adventure
he
had
wandered
about
the
world
fighting
in
many
lands
and
had
been
in
braddock
army
when
it
was
defeated
he
never
became
an
american
at
heart
like
some
other
englishmen
who
fought
on
their
side
he
cared
little
for
them
he
cared
as
little
for
the
cause
in
which
they
were
fighting
merely
seeing
in
it
a
chance
of
making
himself
famous
and
he
had
a
very
poor
opinion
of
their
fighting
qualities
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
with
a
ugly
face
and
a
disagreeable
manner
he
had
a
great
opinion
of
himself
and
boasted
to
such
purpose
that
the
americans
believed
him
to
be
a
military
genius
and
in
this
first
tussle
with
the
british
in
the
south
he
did
so
well
that
their
belief
in
him
seemed
justified
he
seemed
to
the
people
a
hero
and
a
genius
rolled
in
one
in
all
the
war
after
he
did
nothing
to
uphold
the
fame
he
gained
at
charleston
south
as
well
as
north
had
now
had
a
taste
of
war
south
as
well
as
north
had
seen
the
british
sail
away
foiled
every
royal
governor
had
by
this
time
been
driven
from
his
post
and
for
six
months
and
more
the
colonies
had
practically
ruled
themselves
what
then
said
many
was
the
use
of
talking
any
more
about
allegiance
to
the
mother
country
it
was
time
they
said
to
announce
to
all
the
world
that
the
colonies
of
america
were
a
free
and
independent
nation
there
was
much
grave
discussion
in
congress
and
throughout
the
country
some
patriots
even
those
who
longed
most
ardently
to
see
america
a
free
country
thought
that
it
was
too
soon
to
make
the
claim
among
those
was
patrick
henry
who
had
already
ranged
himself
so
passionately
on
the
side
of
freedom
the
struggle
is
only
beginning
he
said
and
we
are
not
yet
united
wait
till
we
are
united
wait
until
we
have
won
our
freedom
then
let
us
proclaim
it
but
by
degrees
all
those
who
hesitated
were
won
over
and
on
the
of
july
the
colonies
declared
themselves
to
be
free
many
meetings
were
held
in
what
has
since
been
called
independence
hall
at
philadelphia
much
discussion
there
was
but
at
length
the
solemn
declaration
was
drawn
up
we
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
of
america
so
it
ran
in
general
congress
assembled
appealing
to
the
supreme
judge
of
the
world
for
the
rectitude
of
our
intention
do
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
good
people
of
these
colonies
solemnly
publish
and
declare
that
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
states
these
are
but
a
few
words
of
the
long
gravely
worded
declaration
which
was
drawn
up
by
thomas
jefferson
and
which
is
familiar
to
every
american
to
this
day
john
hancock
was
president
of
congress
at
this
time
and
he
was
the
first
to
sign
the
declaration
large
and
clear
and
all
across
the
page
the
signature
runs
showing
as
it
were
the
calm
mind
and
firm
judgment
which
guided
the
hand
that
wrote
it
was
not
until
a
few
days
later
that
it
was
signed
by
the
other
members
it
was
on
the
of
july
that
congress
agreed
to
the
declaration
and
so
that
day
has
ever
since
been
kept
as
a
national
holiday
it
was
the
birthday
of
the
united
states
as
a
nation
but
it
was
not
until
a
few
days
later
that
the
declaration
was
read
to
the
people
of
philadelphia
from
independence
hall
it
was
greeted
with
cheers
and
shouts
of
delight
the
old
bell
upon
the
tower
pealed
joyfully
and
swift
riders
mounted
and
rode
to
bear
the
news
in
all
directions
the
next
day
it
was
read
at
the
head
of
each
brigade
of
the
army
and
was
greeted
with
loud
cheers
this
declaration
of
independence
was
a
bold
deed
it
might
almost
seem
a
rash
one
for
the
british
army
was
still
in
the
land
and
the
americans
by
no
means
always
victorious
but
the
very
fact
of
the
boldness
of
the
deed
made
them
feel
that
they
must
be
brave
and
steadfast
and
that
having
claimed
freedom
they
must
win
it
the
declaration
drew
the
colonies
together
as
nothing
else
had
done
and
even
those
who
had
thought
the
deed
too
rash
came
to
see
that
it
had
been
wise
chapter
the
darkest
hour
trenton
and
princeton
in
many
places
the
news
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
news
of
the
victory
at
charleston
came
at
the
same
time
and
gave
a
double
cause
for
rejoicing
it
was
the
last
good
news
which
was
to
come
for
many
a
long
day
indeed
for
months
misfortune
followed
misfortune
until
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
declaration
of
independence
had
been
the
rash
and
useless
action
some
had
held
it
to
be
by
the
end
of
june
general
howe
sailed
southward
from
halifax
and
landed
on
staten
island
southwest
of
new
york
to
await
the
arrival
from
england
of
his
brother
admiral
howe
on
july
just
eight
days
after
the
declaration
of
independence
admiral
howe
arrived
with
strong
reinforcements
of
ships
and
men
but
before
he
began
to
fight
he
tried
to
come
to
terms
with
the
rebel
colonies
and
for
a
second
time
free
pardon
was
offered
to
all
who
would
submit
and
own
british
rule
once
more
but
the
americans
were
in
no
mood
to
submit
and
had
no
wish
for
pardon
no
doubt
said
one
we
all
need
pardon
from
heaven
but
the
american
who
needs
pardon
from
his
britannic
majesty
is
yet
to
be
found
so
instead
of
submitting
they
made
ready
to
fight
the
british
also
prepared
to
fight
and
the
force
of
the
next
blow
fell
upon
new
york
there
were
now
more
than
thirty
thousand
british
troops
gathered
here
it
was
the
largest
army
which
had
ever
been
sent
out
of
england
and
king
george
had
never
a
doubt
that
this
great
force
backed
by
his
unconquerable
navy
would
soon
bring
the
ten
or
twenty
thousand
ragged
half
starved
rebels
to
their
knees
he
little
knew
the
men
or
the
man
which
who
he
had
to
deal
the
army
was
indeed
ragged
and
undisciplined
but
as
the
great
napoleon
said
later
in
war
the
man
is
everything
and
washington
was
soon
to
show
the
world
what
could
be
done
by
brave
undisciplined
men
whose
hearts
were
behind
their
muskets
as
soon
as
washington
had
gained
possession
of
boston
he
left
an
old
general
with
a
small
force
to
guard
it
and
transported
the
main
body
of
his
army
to
new
york
feeling
sure
that
the
next
attack
would
be
made
there
brooklyn
heights
on
long
island
commanded
new
york
very
much
in
the
same
way
as
bunker
hill
and
dorchester
heights
commanded
boston
and
washington
knew
he
must
keep
possession
of
those
heights
if
new
york
was
not
to
be
given
up
without
a
blow
being
struck
he
did
not
want
to
give
it
up
without
striking
a
blow
for
he
feared
the
effect
on
the
spirits
of
the
country
so
he
send
general
putnam
with
about
eight
thousand
men
to
occupy
the
heights
in
doing
this
washington
placed
his
army
in
a
very
dangerous
position
for
the
east
river
was
large
enough
to
allow
british
war
ships
to
sail
up
it
and
thus
cut
his
army
in
two
but
he
could
do
nothing
else
for
if
the
enemy
got
possession
of
the
heights
the
town
was
at
his
mercy
howe
was
not
slow
to
see
this
and
having
carefully
and
secretly
made
his
plans
he
attacked
the
forces
on
brooklyn
heights
in
the
early
morning
of
august
in
front
and
flank
and
rear
all
at
once
one
division
of
the
americans
was
nearly
wiped
out
many
being
killed
and
the
rest
being
taken
prisoner
a
little
band
of
marylanders
put
up
a
fine
but
hopeless
fight
for
nearly
four
hours
the
remnant
of
them
at
length
taking
refuge
in
the
fortifications
to
make
the
defeat
a
disaster
for
the
colonists
howe
had
but
to
storm
these
fortifications
but
he
refused
to
do
so
enough
had
been
done
for
one
day
he
said
bunker
hill
had
taught
the
british
to
beware
of
storming
heights
a
siege
would
be
less
costly
thought
howe
within
the
fortifications
the
colonists
were
in
a
miserable
plight
they
had
little
shelter
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
a
cold
northeast
wind
chilled
them
to
the
bone
they
had
nothing
to
eat
except
dry
biscuit
and
raw
pork
they
were
hungry
and
weary
wet
and
cold
yet
one
of
their
miseries
was
a
blessing
for
as
long
as
the
northeast
wind
blew
howe
could
not
bring
his
ships
up
the
east
river
and
cut
communications
between
long
island
and
new
york
for
in
those
days
it
must
be
remembered
there
were
no
steamers
and
sailing
vessels
had
to
depend
on
wind
and
tide
washington
however
knew
his
danger
he
knew
that
he
must
withdraw
from
long
island
so
secretly
he
gave
orders
that
everything
which
could
be
found
in
the
shape
of
a
boat
was
to
be
brought
to
brooklyn
ferry
they
were
soon
gathered
and
at
eight
in
the
evening
two
days
after
the
battle
of
long
island
quickly
and
quietly
the
army
was
ferried
across
the
wide
river
to
the
new
york
side
all
night
the
rowers
laboured
but
the
work
was
by
no
means
finished
when
day
dawned
the
weather
however
still
helped
the
colonists
for
a
thick
fog
settled
over
the
river
and
hid
what
was
going
on
from
the
british
wounded
prisoners
cannon
stores
horses
were
all
ferried
over
and
when
later
in
the
day
the
british
marched
into
the
deserted
camp
they
found
not
so
much
as
a
crust
of
bread
it
was
about
six
in
the
morning
when
the
last
boat
put
off
and
in
it
was
washington
the
last
man
to
leave
for
forty
hours
he
had
hardly
been
off
his
horse
and
had
never
for
a
minute
lain
down
to
rest
he
was
unwearyingly
watchful
and
left
nothing
to
chance
and
this
retreat
is
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
most
masterly
in
all
military
history
having
abandoned
brooklyn
washington
knew
that
he
could
not
hope
to
hold
new
york
against
an
attack
but
for
a
fortnight
neither
admiral
nor
general
howe
made
any
attack
instead
they
talked
once
more
of
peace
it
almost
seemed
as
if
lord
howe
were
on
the
side
of
the
americans
as
indeed
he
had
always
said
he
was
until
he
was
ordered
out
to
fight
against
them
he
is
either
a
very
slow
officer
or
else
he
is
our
very
good
friend
said
one
of
them
the
fortnight
which
he
now
wasted
gave
washington
time
to
decide
what
it
was
best
to
do
and
when
at
last
the
british
began
the
attack
on
new
york
nearly
all
the
stores
and
cannon
had
already
been
removed
to
harlem
heights
about
ten
miles
away
at
the
north
of
manhattan
island
all
the
troops
too
had
gone
except
about
four
thousand
under
general
putnam
who
stayed
to
keep
order
and
look
after
the
removal
of
the
last
of
the
stores
when
the
attack
came
these
were
very
nearly
caught
for
the
regiment
who
ought
to
have
guarded
the
landing
place
and
have
kept
the
enemy
from
advancing
until
putnam
could
retire
ran
away
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
red
coats
in
vain
their
officers
tried
to
rally
them
panic
had
seized
them
and
they
fled
like
frightened
sheep
in
the
confusion
washington
rode
up
he
was
a
man
of
fiery
temper
and
now
when
he
saw
his
men
show
such
a
lack
of
courage
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
he
lost
all
control
dashing
his
had
upon
the
ground
and
drawing
his
sword
he
bade
them
cease
their
cowardly
retreat
but
even
washington
could
not
rally
the
fleeing
men
then
his
wrath
and
despair
knew
no
bounds
and
spurring
his
horse
he
rode
alone
towards
the
enemy
death
he
felt
was
better
than
such
shame
but
one
of
his
officers
dashing
after
him
seized
his
bridle
and
turned
him
back
to
safety
meanwhile
putnam
was
making
frantic
efforts
to
gather
his
men
and
march
them
off
to
harlem
heights
it
was
a
day
of
violent
heat
and
as
the
men
struggled
on
laden
with
their
baggage
their
breath
came
short
and
the
perspiration
trickled
down
their
faces
every
moment
they
expected
to
be
attacked
in
the
rear
but
the
attack
did
not
come
for
as
howe
and
his
officers
were
passing
the
pleasant
country
house
of
robert
murray
a
servant
came
out
to
ask
them
to
lunch
it
was
a
tempting
invitation
on
a
hot
day
too
tempting
to
be
refused
so
a
halt
was
called
and
while
howe
and
his
officers
enjoyed
a
pleasant
meal
and
listened
to
the
talk
of
a
clever
handsome
lady
putnam
marched
his
panting
men
to
safety
washington
was
greatly
cast
down
at
what
he
called
the
disgraceful
and
dastardly
conduct
of
some
of
his
troops
that
day
he
knew
that
an
attack
on
harlem
heights
must
come
and
come
soon
but
what
would
be
the
result
would
his
men
run
away
or
would
they
fight
experience
to
my
extreme
affliction
he
wrote
sadly
has
convinced
me
that
this
is
rather
to
be
wished
for
than
expected
however
i
trust
there
are
many
who
will
act
like
men
and
show
themselves
worthy
of
the
blessings
of
freedom
washington
had
no
real
cause
for
fear
next
day
the
test
came
and
the
americans
wiped
out
the
memory
of
the
day
before
in
wave
after
wave
the
british
attacked
but
again
and
again
the
colonists
met
them
and
at
last
drove
them
to
their
trenches
and
there
was
joy
in
the
patriot
camp
howe
still
pursued
the
war
very
slowly
after
the
battle
of
harlem
heights
he
left
washington
along
for
nearly
a
month
during
which
time
the
colonist
fortified
their
camp
strongly
but
the
soon
became
convinced
that
the
place
was
little
better
than
a
trap
in
which
howe
might
surround
him
and
force
him
to
surrender
with
all
his
army
so
he
retreated
northward
to
white
plains
and
the
british
settled
down
in
new
york
which
they
held
till
the
end
of
the
war
and
now
misfortunes
fell
thick
and
fast
upon
the
patriots
they
still
held
fort
washington
on
manhattan
island
and
fort
lee
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hudson
the
garrisons
of
which
were
under
the
command
of
general
greene
washington
now
advised
him
to
abandon
the
forts
but
did
not
give
him
absolute
orders
to
do
so
it
is
probably
that
he
would
have
taken
his
commander
advice
had
not
congress
interfered
and
sent
orders
that
fort
washington
was
not
to
be
given
up
except
as
a
last
necessity
greene
believing
that
it
was
possible
to
hold
it
tried
to
obey
congress
but
on
the
of
november
after
a
fierce
fight
against
tremendous
odds
the
fort
was
surrounded
and
all
the
defenders
to
the
number
of
about
three
thousand
were
taken
prisoner
the
loss
was
a
bitter
blow
to
washington
for
the
men
taken
prisoners
were
some
of
his
best
soldiers
four
days
later
fort
lee
was
also
taken
and
although
the
garrison
escaped
they
left
behind
them
large
stores
of
food
ammunition
baggage
of
all
sorts
as
well
as
cannon
which
they
could
ill
spare
washington
now
resolved
on
a
retreat
towards
philadelphia
and
gloom
settled
on
the
ragged
little
army
of
patriots
they
were
weary
of
retreats
and
defeats
and
felt
that
their
cause
was
already
lost
winter
was
fast
coming
on
and
many
shouldered
their
arms
and
marched
homeward
and
so
the
once
buoyant
enthusiastic
army
melted
away
to
a
hungry
and
dispirited
troop
of
little
more
than
four
thousand
general
lee
had
at
this
time
but
lately
returned
from
his
triumphs
in
south
carolina
and
he
was
more
boastful
and
arrogant
than
ever
after
washington
he
was
second
in
command
but
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
he
ought
to
be
first
now
he
was
not
slow
to
let
others
know
what
he
thought
and
while
washington
noble
and
upright
gentleman
as
he
was
trusted
lee
as
a
friend
and
believed
in
him
as
a
soldier
lee
schemed
to
supplant
him
washington
had
left
lee
at
north
castle
with
seven
thousand
men
now
he
sent
him
orders
to
join
him
at
once
so
that
if
he
should
have
to
fight
a
battle
he
could
have
at
least
some
sort
of
army
to
fight
with
but
lee
pretended
to
misunderstand
he
made
excuses
for
delay
he
argued
and
lied
and
stayed
where
he
was
perhaps
he
thought
that
it
would
be
no
bad
thing
if
washington
should
be
defeated
and
captured
then
he
would
be
but
it
was
lee
who
was
captured
not
washington
he
had
in
a
leisurely
fashion
at
last
begun
to
move
and
on
the
march
he
spent
a
night
at
a
wayside
inn
the
british
hearing
of
his
whereabouts
surrounded
the
inn
and
took
him
prisoner
for
more
than
a
year
he
remained
in
their
hands
a
very
comfortable
captive
and
his
army
under
general
john
sullivan
marched
to
join
washington
who
was
still
retreating
southward
through
new
jersey
before
the
overwhelming
force
of
the
british
it
was
weary
work
retreating
but
with
masterly
generalship
and
untiring
watchfulness
washington
avoided
a
battle
and
slipped
through
the
toils
as
the
pursued
and
pursuers
neared
philadelphia
something
like
panic
laid
hold
of
the
city
all
day
long
the
rumble
of
wagons
might
be
heard
carrying
women
and
children
to
places
of
safety
congress
was
hurriedly
removed
to
baltimore
but
hundreds
of
men
seized
their
rifles
and
marched
to
join
the
army
to
fight
for
their
country
in
its
darkest
hour
but
already
the
worst
was
over
washington
army
was
now
well
reinforced
he
had
the
recruits
from
philadelphia
he
had
army
and
he
also
had
two
thousand
men
sent
him
by
schuyler
from
the
north
so
he
resolved
to
make
a
bold
bid
for
fortune
he
resolved
to
do
or
die
he
gave
as
the
password
victory
or
death
and
in
the
dark
of
christmas
night
he
and
his
men
crossed
the
delaware
river
above
the
town
of
trenton
where
the
british
lay
together
with
a
large
company
of
the
hessian
troops
who
had
been
hired
to
fight
the
americans
the
river
was
full
of
floating
ice
which
made
the
crossing
dangerous
and
slow
but
through
the
darkness
the
men
toiled
on
fending
off
the
ice
blocks
as
best
they
could
as
they
steered
their
boats
through
the
drifting
mass
at
length
after
ten
hours
labour
they
reached
the
other
side
without
the
loss
of
one
man
it
was
four
when
the
troops
started
off
on
their
march
to
trenton
over
the
snowy
ground
the
icy
wind
driving
the
sleet
and
snow
in
their
faces
but
by
eight
they
had
reached
trenton
the
british
were
utterly
taken
by
surprise
and
almost
at
once
the
hessians
surrendered
having
sent
his
prisoners
to
the
number
of
nearly
a
thousand
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
washington
took
possession
of
the
town
but
he
was
not
long
allowed
to
remain
there
for
the
british
commander
lord
cornwallis
marched
to
dislodge
him
with
an
army
of
eight
thousand
men
washington
let
him
come
and
on
the
of
january
cornwallis
encamped
before
trenton
determined
next
morning
to
give
battle
he
was
sure
of
victory
and
in
great
spirits
at
last
we
have
run
down
the
old
fox
and
we
will
bag
him
in
the
morning
he
said
but
washington
was
not
to
be
so
easily
caught
the
two
armies
were
so
near
that
the
watchfires
of
the
one
could
be
plainly
seen
by
the
other
all
night
the
american
watchfires
blazed
all
night
men
could
be
heard
working
at
the
fortifications
but
that
was
only
a
blind
in
the
darkness
washington
and
his
army
quietly
slipped
away
to
princeton
there
he
fell
upon
the
british
reinforcements
who
were
marching
to
join
cornwallis
at
trenton
and
put
them
to
flight
when
day
came
cornwallis
was
astonished
to
find
the
american
camp
empty
and
when
he
heard
the
firing
in
the
distance
he
knew
what
had
happened
and
hastily
retreated
to
new
york
while
washington
drew
off
his
victorious
but
weary
men
to
morristown
in
new
jersey
here
for
the
next
few
months
they
remained
resting
after
their
labours
unmolested
by
the
foe
chapter
burgoyne
campaign
bennington
and
oriskany
as
many
of
the
americans
had
foreseen
the
british
had
from
the
first
formed
the
design
of
cutting
the
colonies
in
two
by
taking
possession
of
the
great
waterway
from
the
hudson
to
the
lawrence
their
plans
had
been
long
delayed
but
in
the
spring
of
they
determined
to
carry
them
out
general
burgoyne
was
now
in
command
of
the
canadian
troops
he
was
a
genial
man
of
fashion
a
writer
of
plays
and
a
great
gambler
but
he
was
a
brave
soldier
too
and
his
men
adored
him
for
in
days
when
it
was
common
to
treat
the
rank
and
file
as
a
little
better
than
dogs
burgoyne
treated
them
like
reasoning
beings
it
was
arranged
that
burgoyne
should
move
southward
with
his
main
force
by
way
of
lake
champlain
to
ticonderoga
and
that
a
smaller
force
should
go
by
lake
ontario
and
seize
fort
stanwix
howe
at
the
same
time
was
in
albany
having
it
was
to
be
supposed
swept
the
whole
country
free
of
rebels
it
was
a
very
fine
plan
but
it
was
not
carried
out
as
intended
because
although
burgoyne
received
his
orders
howe
did
not
receive
his
for
the
british
minister
who
ought
to
have
sent
them
went
off
on
a
holiday
and
forgot
all
about
the
matter
for
several
weeks
when
at
length
he
remembered
and
sent
the
order
howe
was
far
away
from
the
hudson
at
his
old
game
of
trying
to
run
washington
to
earth
burgoyne
however
knew
nothing
of
this
and
cheerfully
set
out
from
canada
with
a
well
drilled
well
equipped
and
well
fed
army
of
about
eight
thousand
men
and
on
the
of
july
reached
ticonderoga
since
this
fort
had
been
taken
by
ethan
allen
it
had
been
greatly
strengthened
and
the
americans
believed
that
now
it
could
withstand
any
assault
however
vigorous
but
while
strengthening
the
fort
itself
they
failed
to
fortify
a
little
hill
near
they
had
already
much
experience
of
the
danger
of
heights
commanding
a
town
or
fort
but
they
thought
that
this
hill
was
too
steep
and
rugged
to
be
a
danger
no
cannon
it
was
said
could
ever
be
dragged
up
to
the
top
of
it
when
the
british
came
however
they
thought
otherwise
they
at
once
saw
the
value
of
the
hill
and
determined
that
guns
should
be
dragged
up
it
for
hours
they
worked
furiously
and
when
day
dawned
on
the
of
august
both
men
and
guns
were
on
the
summit
the
american
commander
clair
saw
them
with
despair
in
his
heart
every
corner
of
the
fort
was
commanded
by
the
guns
and
the
garrison
utterly
at
the
mercy
of
the
enemy
to
remain
he
knew
would
mean
the
loss
of
his
whole
force
so
he
resolved
to
abandon
the
fort
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
set
the
work
was
begun
guns
and
stores
were
laden
on
boats
cannon
too
heavy
to
be
removed
were
spiked
and
nearly
all
the
garrison
had
left
when
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
officers
quarters
the
light
of
the
flames
showed
the
british
sentinels
what
was
going
on
the
alarm
was
given
the
british
made
a
dash
for
the
fort
and
as
day
dawned
on
july
the
union
jack
was
once
more
planted
upon
its
ramparts
then
a
hot
pursuit
began
at
the
village
of
hubbardton
the
americans
made
a
valiant
stand
but
they
were
worsted
and
fled
and
five
days
later
clair
brought
the
remnant
of
his
force
into
fort
edward
where
the
main
army
under
schuyler
was
stationed
burgoyne
had
begun
well
and
when
king
george
heard
the
news
he
clapped
his
hands
with
joy
i
have
beat
them
he
cried
dashing
into
the
queen
rooms
i
have
beat
all
the
americans
but
over
america
the
loss
cast
a
gloom
clair
and
schuyler
were
severely
blamed
and
but
both
were
honourably
acquitted
nothing
could
have
saved
the
garrison
from
being
utterly
wiped
out
and
when
men
came
to
judge
the
matter
calmly
they
admitted
that
it
was
better
to
lose
the
fort
than
to
lose
the
fort
and
garrison
also
meanwhile
burgoyne
was
chasing
after
the
fugitives
as
he
approached
schuyler
abandoned
fort
edward
for
it
was
a
mere
shell
and
impossible
of
defence
for
a
single
day
but
as
he
fell
back
he
broke
up
the
roads
behind
him
trees
were
felled
and
laid
across
them
every
two
or
three
yards
bridges
were
burned
fords
destroyed
so
thoroughly
was
the
work
done
that
burgoyne
in
pursuit
could
only
march
about
a
mile
a
day
and
had
to
build
no
fewer
than
forty
bridges
in
a
distance
of
little
more
than
miles
besides
destroying
the
roads
schuyler
also
made
the
country
a
desert
he
carried
away
and
destroyed
the
crops
drove
off
the
sheep
and
cattle
sweeping
the
country
so
bare
that
the
hostile
army
could
find
no
food
and
were
forced
to
depend
altogether
on
their
own
supplies
before
long
these
gave
out
and
the
british
began
to
suffer
from
hunger
burgoyne
now
learned
that
at
the
village
of
bennington
the
patriots
had
a
depot
containing
large
stores
of
food
and
ammunition
these
he
determined
to
have
for
his
own
army
and
he
sent
a
force
of
six
hundred
men
mostly
germans
and
indians
to
make
the
capture
this
old
trapper
captain
john
stark
was
in
command
of
the
american
force
at
bennington
he
had
fought
in
many
battles
from
bunker
hill
to
princeton
but
finding
himself
passed
over
when
others
were
promoted
he
had
gone
off
homeward
in
dudgeon
but
now
in
his
hour
of
need
he
forgot
his
grievances
and
once
more
girded
on
his
sword
he
led
his
men
with
splendid
dash
and
the
enemy
was
utterly
defeated
and
stark
was
made
a
brigadier
general
as
a
reward
it
was
a
disaster
for
burgoyne
and
on
the
heels
of
this
defeat
came
the
news
that
the
second
force
marching
by
way
of
lake
ontario
had
also
met
with
disaster
at
oriskany
near
fort
stanwix
this
force
had
surrounded
fort
stanwix
and
general
nicholas
herkimer
had
marched
to
its
relief
general
herkimer
was
an
old
german
of
over
sixty
and
although
he
had
lived
all
his
life
in
america
and
loved
the
country
with
his
whole
heart
he
spoke
english
very
badly
and
wrote
it
worse
it
must
have
sadly
puzzled
his
officers
sometimes
to
make
out
his
dispatches
and
orders
one
is
said
to
have
run
as
follows
ser
yu
will
orter

this
being
translated
means
sir
you
will
order
your
battalion
to
march
immediately
to
fort
edward
with
four
days
provisions
and
ammunition
for
one
battle
this
you
will
disobey
at
your
peril
as
this
doughty
old
german
marched
to
the
relief
of
fort
stanwix
he
fell
into
an
ambush
prepared
for
him
by
the
famous
indian
chief
joseph
brant
who
with
his
braves
was
fighting
on
the
side
of
the
british
a
terrible
hand
to
hand
struggle
followed
the
air
was
filled
with
wild
yells
and
still
wilder
curses
as
the
two
foes
grappled
it
was
war
in
all
its
savagery
tomahawks
and
knives
were
used
as
freely
as
rifles
stabbing
shooting
wrestling
the
men
fought
each
other
more
like
wildcats
than
human
beings
a
fearful
thunderstorm
burst
forth
too
rain
fell
in
torrents
a
raging
wind
tore
through
the
tree
tops
thunder
and
lightning
added
their
terrors
to
the
scene
for
five
hours
the
savage
warfare
lasted
almost
at
the
beginning
a
ball
shattered
herkimer
leg
and
killed
his
horse
but
the
stout
old
warrior
refused
to
leave
the
field
he
bade
his
men
take
the
saddle
from
his
horse
and
place
it
at
the
root
of
a
great
beech
tree
sitting
there
he
directed
the
battle
shouting
his
orders
in
his
quaint
guttural
english
and
calmly
smoking
a
pipe
the
while
they
were
the
last
orders
he
was
to
give
for
ten
days
after
the
battle
he
died
from
his
wound
serenely
smoking
his
pipe
and
reading
his
old
german
bible
almost
to
the
last
soon
the
noise
of
the
battle
was
heard
at
fort
stanwix
and
the
garrison
led
by
colonel
marinus
willett
sallied
forth
to
the
aid
of
their
comrades
put
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
to
flight
and
captured
their
stores
of
food
and
ammunition
together
with
five
flags
and
now
for
the
first
time
the
stars
and
stripes
were
unfurled
when
washington
had
taken
command
of
the
army
there
had
still
been
no
real
thought
of
separating
from
britain
so
for
his
flag
he
had
used
the
british
ensign
with
the
union
jack
in
the
corner
but
instead
of
a
red
ground
he
had
used
a
ground
of
thirteen
red
and
white
stripes
on
stripe
for
each
colony
but
when
all
hope
of
reconciliation
was
gone
congress
decided
that
the
union
jack
must
be
cut
out
of
the
flag
altogether
and
in
its
place
a
blue
square
was
to
be
used
with
thirteen
white
stars
in
a
circle
one
star
for
each
state
just
as
there
was
one
stripe
for
each
state
people
however
were
too
busy
doing
other
things
and
had
no
time
to
see
to
the
making
of
flags
so
the
first
one
was
hoisted
by
colonel
willett
after
the
battle
of
orskany
he
had
captured
five
standards
these
as
victor
he
hoisted
on
the
fort
to
make
his
triumph
complete
however
he
wanted
an
american
flag
to
hoist
over
them
but
he
had
none
so
a
soldier
wife
gave
her
red
petticoat
some
one
else
supplied
a
white
shirt
and
out
of
that
and
an
old
blue
jacket
was
made
the
first
american
flag
to
float
upon
the
breeze
this
of
course
was
only
a
rough
and
ready
flag
and
betsy
ross
a
seamstress
who
lived
in
arch
street
philadelphia
had
the
honour
of
making
the
first
real
one
while
in
philadelphia
washington
and
some
members
of
council
called
upon
betsy
to
ask
her
to
make
the
flag
washington
had
brought
a
sketch
with
him
but
betsy
suggested
some
alterations
so
washington
drew
another
sketch
and
there
and
then
betsy
set
to
work
and
very
soon
her
flag
also
was
floating
in
the
breeze
chapter
burgoyne
campaign
bemis
heights
and
saratoga
after
all
the
fierce
fighting
at
oriskany
neither
side
could
claim
a
victory
the
british
had
received
a
check
but
were
by
no
means
beaten
fort
stanwix
was
still
besieged
and
unless
relief
came
must
soon
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
colonel
gansewoort
the
commandant
of
the
fort
therefore
now
sent
to
schuyler
asking
for
help
and
benedict
arnold
who
had
but
lately
arrived
volunteering
for
the
service
was
soon
on
his
way
with
twelve
hundred
men
arnold
was
ready
enough
to
fight
as
he
was
but
he
knew
that
his
force
was
much
smaller
than
that
of
the
british
and
after
some
thought
he
fell
upon
a
plan
by
which
theirs
could
be
made
less
a
spy
had
been
caught
within
the
american
lines
and
was
condemned
to
death
he
was
an
almost
creature
with
queer
cunning
ways
and
the
indians
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
medicine
man
and
feared
him
accordingly
knowing
this
arnold
thought
that
he
might
be
useful
to
him
and
promised
to
spare
his
life
if
he
would
go
to
the
british
camp
and
spread
a
report
among
their
indian
allies
that
the
americans
were
coming
down
upon
them
in
tremendous
force
the
man
was
glad
enough
to
get
a
chance
to
escape
being
hanged
and
his
brother
being
held
as
hostage
he
set
out
he
acted
his
part
well
panting
and
breathless
with
his
coat
torn
in
many
places
by
bullets
and
a
face
twisted
with
fear
he
dashed
into
the
enemy
camp
there
he
told
his
eager
listeners
that
he
had
barely
escaped
with
his
life
from
the
americans
which
was
true
enough
and
that
they
were
marching
towards
them
in
vast
numbers
and
showed
his
coat
as
proof
of
his
story
how
many
are
they
he
was
asked
in
reply
the
man
spread
his
hands
abroad
pointing
to
the
leaves
of
the
trees
and
shaking
his
head
as
if
in
awe
the
indians
were
greatly
disturbed
and
began
to
hold
a
council
while
they
were
still
consulting
an
indian
friendly
to
the
americans
who
was
in
the
plot
arrived
he
told
the
same
story
as
the
spy
pointing
like
him
to
the
numberless
trees
of
the
forest
when
asked
how
many
of
the
enemy
were
coming
then
another
and
still
another
indian
arrived
they
all
told
the
same
tale
a
mysterious
bird
had
come
to
warn
them
they
said
that
the
whole
valley
was
filled
with
warriors
at
length
the
indians
could
bear
no
more
already
many
of
their
best
warriors
had
been
slain
they
would
no
longer
stay
to
be
utterly
wiped
out
and
they
prepared
to
flee
in
vain
the
british
commander
implored
them
to
stay
bribes
threats
and
promises
were
all
alike
useless
at
last
he
offered
them
fire
water
for
if
only
he
could
make
them
drunk
he
thought
they
might
forget
their
fear
but
even
the
much
coveted
fire
water
had
no
power
to
still
their
terrors
they
refused
to
drink
and
with
clamour
and
noise
they
fled
the
panic
spread
to
the
rest
of
the
army
two
battalions
of
white
men
followed
in
the
wake
of
their
redskin
brothers
and
the
commander
deserted
by
the
bulk
of
his
army
was
forced
to
join
in
the
general
retreat
it
was
a
humiliating
and
disorderly
flight
the
indians
when
they
recovered
from
their
terror
had
lost
every
vestige
of
respect
for
their
white
brothers
soon
they
became
insolent
and
amused
themselves
by
playing
on
their
fears
they
are
coming
they
are
coming
they
would
cry
whenever
the
weary
fugitives
lay
down
to
rest
then
they
would
laugh
to
see
the
white
men
leap
up
again
fling
away
their
knapsacks
and
their
rifles
so
as
to
make
the
greater
haste
and
stumble
onward
at
length
the
shameful
retreat
came
to
an
end
and
hungry
and
ragged
a
feeble
remnant
of
the
expedition
reached
the
shores
of
lake
ontario
and
passed
over
into
canada
such
was
the
news
brought
to
burgoyne
soon
after
the
defeat
at
bennington
it
make
his
dark
outlook
darker
still
no
help
could
ever
come
to
him
now
from
the
north
and
all
his
hopes
were
fixed
on
howe
advancing
host
from
the
south
but
no
news
of
approach
reached
him
day
by
day
the
american
force
round
him
was
increasing
day
by
day
his
own
was
growing
weaker
at
last
in
desperation
he
decided
to
risk
a
battle
for
he
saw
that
he
must
either
soon
cut
his
way
through
the
hostile
forces
or
perish
miserable
general
horatio
gates
was
now
in
command
of
the
americans
instead
of
schuyler
gates
was
nothing
of
a
soldier
indeed
it
was
said
of
him
that
all
throughout
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
never
so
much
as
heard
the
sound
of
a
gun
and
that
when
there
was
a
battle
to
the
fore
he
always
had
business
elsewhere
like
lee
he
was
an
englishman
by
birth
and
even
as
lee
had
been
jealous
of
washington
so
gates
was
jealous
of
schuyler
and
at
last
he
succeeded
in
ousting
him
he
did
so
at
a
good
time
for
himself
for
all
the
hard
work
of
this
campaign
was
done
and
gates
stepped
in
time
to
reap
the
glory
burgoyne
thought
little
of
gates
and
called
him
an
old
woman
so
he
was
the
more
ready
to
give
battle
but
the
americans
were
now
so
thoroughly
aroused
that
they
would
have
fought
well
without
a
leader
besides
arnold
was
with
them
and
arnold
they
would
have
followed
anywhere
the
americans
were
strongly
entrenched
on
bemis
heights
and
on
the
day
of
battle
gates
would
have
done
nothing
but
sit
still
and
let
the
enemy
wear
himself
out
in
attacks
but
this
did
not
suit
arnold
fiery
temper
and
he
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
charge
the
enemy
bates
grudgingly
gave
him
leave
and
with
a
small
force
he
bore
down
upon
the
british
the
fight
was
fierce
and
finding
his
force
too
small
arnold
sent
to
gates
asking
for
reinforcements
but
gates
although
he
had
ten
thousand
troops
standing
idle
refused
to
send
a
man
so
with
his
always
diminishing
handful
of
troops
arnold
fought
on
till
night
fell
again
neither
side
could
claim
a
victory
but
burgoyne
had
lost
nearly
six
hundred
men
and
his
position
was
not
one
whit
the
better
gates
took
all
the
credit
to
himself
and
when
he
sent
his
account
of
the
battle
to
congress
he
did
not
so
much
as
mention
arnold
name
out
of
this
and
his
refusal
to
send
reinforcements
a
furious
quarrel
arouse
between
the
two
men
and
gates
told
arnold
that
he
had
no
further
use
for
his
services
and
that
he
could
go
arnold
shaken
with
wrath
would
have
gone
had
not
his
brother
officers
with
one
voice
begged
him
to
stay
so
he
stayed
but
he
had
no
longer
any
command
like
a
caged
and
wounded
lion
burgoyne
now
sought
a
way
out
of
the
trap
in
which
he
was
but
turn
which
way
he
would
there
was
no
escape
he
was
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
so
eighteen
days
after
the
battle
of
bemis
heights
he
took
the
field
again
on
the
same
ground
it
was
a
desperate
adventure
for
what
could
six
thousand
worn
and
weary
men
do
against
twenty
thousand
already
conscious
of
success
the
british
fought
with
dogged
courage
chafing
with
impatience
arnold
watched
the
battle
from
the
heights
he
saw
how
an
attack
might
be
made
with
advantage
how
victory
might
be
won
at
length
he
could
bear
inaction
no
longer
and
leaping
on
to
his
horse
he
dashed
into
the
fray
go
after
that
fellow
and
bring
him
back
shouted
gates
he
will
be
doing
something
rash
the
messenger
sped
after
him
but
arnold
was
too
quick
and
the
battle
was
well
nigh
won
before
gates
order
reached
him
as
arnold
came
his
men
gave
a
ringing
cheer
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
and
daniel
morgan
were
the
leaders
of
the
battle
gates
never
leaving
his
headquarters
where
the
bullets
flew
thickest
there
arnold
was
to
be
found
the
madness
of
battle
was
upon
him
and
like
one
possessed
he
rode
through
flame
and
smoke
his
clear
voice
raised
above
the
hideous
clamour
cheering
and
directing
his
men
the
fight
was
fierce
and
long
but
as
the
day
wore
on
there
could
be
no
more
doubt
about
the
end
the
british
were
defeated
yet
so
long
as
daylight
lasted
they
fought
on
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
arnold
and
his
men
had
routed
a
party
of
germans
and
a
wounded
german
lying
on
the
ground
shot
at
arnold
killing
his
horse
and
shattering
his
leg
the
same
leg
which
had
been
wounded
at
quebec
as
arnold
fell
one
of
his
men
with
a
cry
of
rage
dashed
at
the
german
and
would
have
killed
him
where
he
lay
but
arnold
stopped
him
for
god
sake
do
hurt
him
he
cried
he
a
fine
fellow
so
the
man
life
was
spared
arnold
leg
was
so
badly
shattered
that
the
doctors
talked
of
cutting
it
off
arnold
however
would
not
hear
of
it
if
that
is
all
you
can
do
for
me
he
said
put
me
on
another
horse
and
let
me
see
the
battle
out
but
the
battle
was
over
for
night
had
put
an
end
to
the
dreadful
strife
with
this
defeat
burgoyne
last
hope
vanished
to
fight
again
would
be
merely
to
sacrifice
his
brave
soldiers
he
had
only
food
in
the
camp
for
a
week
and
there
was
still
no
sign
of
help
coming
from
the
south
there
was
nothing
left
to
him
but
to
surrender
so
on
october
he
surrendered
to
general
gates
with
all
his
cannon
ammunition
and
great
stores
and
nearly
six
thousand
men
as
his
soldiers
laid
down
their
arms
many
of
them
wept
bitterly
but
there
was
no
one
there
to
see
or
deride
their
grief
for
the
americans
having
no
wish
to
add
to
the
sorrow
of
their
brave
foe
stayed
within
their
lines
then
as
the
disarmed
soldiers
marched
away
burgoyne
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
and
drawing
his
sword
gave
it
to
general
gates
the
fortune
of
war
has
made
me
your
prisoner
he
said
it
was
through
no
fault
of
yours
replied
gates
with
a
grave
courtesy
as
he
handed
back
the
sword
chapter
brandywine
germantown
valley
forge
washington
spent
the
winter
of
at
morristown
in
may
he
once
more
led
his
army
out
and
while
the
forces
in
the
north
under
schuyler
and
then
gates
were
defeating
burgoyne
he
was
holding
his
own
against
howe
far
more
formidable
army
further
south
howe
had
spent
the
winter
at
new
york
which
from
the
time
of
its
capture
to
the
end
of
the
war
remained
the
british
headquarters
in
the
spring
he
determined
to
capture
philadelphia
the
revel
capital
and
began
to
march
through
new
jersey
but
in
every
move
he
made
he
found
himself
checked
by
washington
it
was
like
a
game
of
chess
washington
army
was
only
about
half
the
size
of
howe
so
he
refused
to
be
drawn
into
an
open
battle
but
harried
and
harassed
his
foe
at
every
turn
and
at
length
drove
howe
back
to
staten
island
having
failed
to
get
to
philadelphia
by
land
howe
now
decided
to
go
by
sea
and
sailing
up
chesapeake
bay
he
landed
in
maryland
in
the
end
of
august
but
there
again
he
found
washington
waiting
for
him
and
now
although
his
army
was
still
much
smaller
than
howe
washington
determined
to
risk
a
battle
rather
than
give
up
philadelphia
without
a
blow
with
his
usual
care
and
genius
washington
chose
his
position
well
on
the
banks
of
the
brandywine
a
little
river
which
falls
into
the
delaware
at
wilmington
about
miles
from
philadelphia
on
both
sides
the
battle
was
well
fought
but
the
british
army
was
larger
better
equipped
and
better
drilled
and
they
gained
the
victory
this
defeat
made
the
fate
of
philadelphia
certain
and
congress
fled
once
more
this
time
to
lancaster
yet
for
a
fortnight
longer
washington
held
back
the
enemy
and
only
on
the
of
september
did
the
british
march
into
the
city
but
before
they
had
time
to
settle
into
their
comfortable
quarters
washington
gave
battle
again
at
germantown
on
the
outskirts
of
philadelphia
it
was
a
well
contested
battle
and
at
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
it
might
end
in
victory
for
the
americans
but
washington
plan
of
battle
was
rather
a
hard
one
for
inexperienced
troops
to
carry
out
they
were
as
brave
as
any
men
who
ever
carried
rifles
but
they
were
so
ignorant
of
drill
that
they
could
not
even
form
into
column
or
wheel
to
right
or
left
in
soldierly
fashion
a
thick
fog
too
which
hung
over
the
field
from
early
morning
made
it
difficult
to
distinguish
friend
from
foe
and
at
one
time
two
divisions
of
the
americans
each
mistaking
the
other
for
the
enemy
fired
upon
each
other
but
although
the
battle
of
germantown
was
a
defeat
for
the
americans
it
by
no
means
spelled
disaster
another
two
months
of
frays
and
skirmishes
followed
then
the
british
settled
down
to
comfortable
winter
quarters
in
philadelphia
and
washington
marched
his
patriots
to
valley
forge
about
twenty
miles
away
wile
the
americans
had
been
busy
losing
and
winning
battles
pitt
in
england
was
still
struggling
for
peace
and
kindly
understanding
between
britain
and
her
colonies
you
can
never
conquer
the
americans
he
cried
if
i
were
an
american
as
i
am
an
englishman
while
a
foreign
troop
was
landed
in
my
country
i
would
never
lay
down
my
arms
never
never
never
but
pitt
talked
in
vain
for
the
king
was
deaf
to
all
the
great
minister
pleadings
in
his
eyes
the
americans
were
rebels
who
must
be
crushed
and
pitt
was
but
the
trumpet
of
sedition
but
meanwhile
all
europe
had
been
watching
the
struggle
of
these
same
rebels
watching
it
too
with
keep
interest
and
admiration
and
now
soldiers
from
many
countries
came
to
offer
help
to
the
americans
among
them
the
best
known
perhaps
are
kosciuszko
who
later
fought
so
bravely
for
his
own
land
poland
and
lafayette
who
took
a
large
share
in
the
french
revolution
lafayette
was
at
this
time
only
nineteen
he
had
an
immense
admiration
for
washington
and
after
they
met
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
the
their
ages
they
became
lifelong
friends
and
lafayette
named
his
eldest
son
after
washington
but
the
americans
owed
more
perhaps
to
baron
von
steuben
than
to
any
other
foreigner
von
steuben
was
a
german
and
had
fought
under
frederick
the
great
washington
had
taken
up
winter
quarters
at
valley
forge
which
is
a
beautiful
little
valley
but
that
winter
it
was
a
scene
of
misery
and
desolation
the
cold
was
terrible
and
the
army
was
ragged
and
hungry
the
men
had
neither
coats
shirts
nor
shoes
and
often
their
feet
and
hands
froze
so
that
they
had
to
be
amputated
for
days
at
a
time
they
had
but
one
poor
meal
a
day
even
washington
saw
no
hope
of
help
i
am
now
convinced
beyond
a
doubt
he
wrote
that
unless
some
great
and
capital
change
takes
place
this
army
must
inevitably
be
reduced
to
one
or
other
of
these
three
things
starve
dissolve
or
disperse
much
of
this
misery
was
due
to
the
neglect
and
folly
of
congress
it
had
sadly
changed
from
the
brave
days
of
the
declaration
of
independence
it
was
filled
now
with
politicians
who
cared
about
their
own
advancement
rather
than
with
patriots
who
sought
their
country
good
they
refused
to
see
that
money
and
still
more
money
was
needed
to
keep
a
properly
equipped
army
in
the
field
they
harassed
washington
with
petty
interference
with
his
plans
they
gave
promotion
to
useless
officers
against
his
wishes
and
better
judgment
there
was
plenty
of
food
in
the
country
stores
of
clothing
were
ready
for
the
army
use
but
they
lay
by
the
wayside
rotting
because
there
was
no
money
to
pay
men
to
bring
it
to
the
army
washington
wore
himself
out
in
fruitless
efforts
to
awaken
congress
to
a
sense
of
its
duty
and
at
length
utterly
despairing
of
any
support
weary
of
seeing
his
men
suffer
and
dwindle
day
by
day
under
the
miseries
of
valley
forge
he
wrote
out
his
resignation
as
of
the
army
and
it
needed
all
the
persuasions
of
his
officers
to
make
him
tear
it
up
it
was
to
this
camp
of
misery
at
valley
forge
that
baron
von
steuben
came
and
the
ragged
hungry
perishing
army
he
drilled
to
these
men
brave
enough
but
all
unused
to
discipline
he
taught
what
discipline
meant
at
first
it
was
by
no
means
easy
for
the
baron
knew
little
english
and
the
men
he
tried
to
teach
knew
not
a
word
of
french
or
german
so
misunderstandings
were
many
and
when
one
day
a
young
american
officer
named
walker
who
knew
french
came
to
von
steuben
and
offered
to
act
as
interpreter
he
was
overjoyed
had
i
seen
an
angel
from
heaven
he
cried
i
could
not
have
been
more
glad
but
even
then
between
his
own
mistakes
and
the
men
mistakes
the
baron
was
often
driven
distracted
and
lost
his
temper
once
it
is
said
utterly
worn
out
he
turned
the
troops
over
to
walker
come
my
friend
he
cried
take
them
i
can
curse
them
no
longer
but
in
spite
of
all
hindrances
and
failings
both
men
and
officers
learned
so
much
from
von
steuben
that
when
the
terrible
winter
was
over
the
army
went
forth
again
to
fight
far
more
fit
to
face
the
foe
than
before
chapter
war
on
the
sea
besides
being
themselves
more
fit
to
fight
the
americans
now
received
other
help
for
france
joined
with
america
in
her
struggle
against
britain
and
after
this
the
war
was
not
confined
to
america
only
there
was
war
on
the
sea
now
as
well
as
on
land
and
whenever
the
british
and
the
french
navies
met
there
was
fighting
the
americans
themselves
also
carried
the
war
on
to
the
sea
at
first
they
had
no
fleet
but
very
soon
they
began
to
build
ships
and
before
long
they
had
a
little
fleet
of
six
of
this
fleet
esek
hopkins
was
made
he
was
an
old
salt
for
he
had
been
captain
of
a
trading
vessel
for
thirty
years
but
as
a
naval
commander
he
was
not
a
success
he
had
no
knowledge
of
warfare
he
was
touchy
obstinate
and
could
not
get
on
with
congress
which
he
said
was
a
pack
of
ignorant
clerks
who
knew
nothing
at
all
the
fleet
under
him
only
made
one
cruise
then
he
was
dismissed
and
was
succeeded
by
james
nicholson
the
son
of
a
scotsman
from
as
the
war
went
on
other
vessels
were
added
to
the
first
six
but
the
largest
was
not
bigger
than
a
small
british
cruiser
and
in
the
end
they
were
nearly
all
taken
or
sunk
to
prevent
them
being
taken
still
before
their
end
they
fought
many
gallant
fights
and
did
some
good
work
for
their
country
the
first
shot
of
the
revolution
on
the
water
was
fired
by
captain
abraham
whipple
when
he
chased
a
tender
belonging
to
the
british
cruiser
rose
and
captured
her
this
was
however
not
the
first
shot
the
hardy
captain
had
fired
against
the
british
for
in
before
the
boston
tea
party
even
had
taken
place
he
had
seized
and
burned
the
british
revenue
schooner
gaspé
in
narragansett
bay
the
commander
of
the
gaspé
had
been
trying
to
put
down
smuggling
on
the
coast
of
rhode
island
he
stopped
all
vessels
and
examined
even
market
boats
to
see
if
they
had
any
smuggled
goods
this
made
the
rhode
island
people
very
angry
they
had
smuggled
as
they
liked
for
a
hundred
years
the
british
laws
against
it
seemed
to
them
mere
tyranny
and
they
looked
upon
the
commander
of
the
gaspé
as
little
better
than
a
pirate
who
was
interfering
with
their
lawful
trade
so
when
one
day
the
people
learned
that
the
gaspé
had
gone
aground
a
few
miles
from
providence
and
could
not
be
got
off
before
three
in
the
morning
they
determined
to
attack
her
abraham
whipple
was
chosen
as
captain
for
the
expedition
he
and
his
men
boarded
the
gaspé
wounded
the
captain
overpowered
the
crew
and
burned
the
schooner
to
the
water
edge
when
the
british
heard
of
it
he
was
furious
and
he
wrote
to
whipple
sir
he
said
you
abraham
whipple
on
the
of
june
burned
his
majesty
ship
the
gaspé
and
i
will
hang
you
at
the
yardarm
to
this
whipple
nothing
daunted
replied
sir
always
catch
a
man
before
you
hang
him
whipple
was
never
caught
until
when
with
his
ship
the
providence
he
tried
to
relieve
charleston
in
south
carolina
which
was
at
that
time
besieged
by
the
british
then
he
was
not
hanged
but
kept
prisoner
until
the
end
of
the
war
lambert
wickes
captain
of
the
reprisal
was
another
gallant
naval
officer
when
benjamin
franklin
was
sent
as
united
states
ambassador
to
france
in
he
sailed
in
the
reprisal
which
was
the
first
american
warship
to
visit
the
shores
of
europe
it
might
be
here
interesting
to
note
that
besides
being
minister
to
france
franklin
had
to
look
after
naval
affairs
in
a
general
way
he
used
his
powers
with
wisdom
and
often
with
great
humanity
among
other
things
he
gave
all
american
naval
commanders
orders
that
they
were
not
to
attack
the
great
discoverer
captain
cook
no
matter
in
what
part
of
the
ocean
they
might
meet
him
they
were
not
merely
forbidden
to
attack
him
they
were
even
commanded
to
offer
him
any
aid
they
could
for
it
would
not
beseem
americans
said
franklin
to
fight
against
one
who
had
earned
the
admiration
of
the
whole
world
the
reprisal
did
not
return
home
before
it
had
made
its
presence
felt
for
having
landed
franklin
wickes
cruised
about
the
bay
of
biscay
and
the
english
channel
capturing
many
british
merchantmen
and
taking
them
to
france
where
he
sold
them
at
this
time
france
was
still
at
peace
with
britain
and
the
british
government
complained
bitterly
to
the
french
at
this
breach
of
neutrality
they
were
therefore
forced
to
order
the
american
ships
to
leave
france
and
wickes
sailed
for
home
on
the
way
the
reprisal
was
chased
by
a
british
warship
and
wickes
only
saved
himself
from
capture
by
throwing
his
guns
overboard
he
thus
escaped
one
danger
however
only
to
fall
into
another
and
in
a
storm
off
the
coast
of
newfoundland
the
reprisal
went
down
and
all
on
board
were
lost
but
of
all
the
naval
commanders
on
the
american
side
the
scotsman
john
paul
jones
was
the
most
famous
he
was
the
son
of
a
gardener
and
was
born
at
arbigland
in
kirkcudbrightshire
from
a
child
he
had
been
fond
of
the
sea
and
when
still
only
a
boy
of
twelve
he
began
his
seafaring
life
on
board
a
ship
trading
with
virginia
for
some
years
he
led
a
roving
and
adventurous
life
then
after
a
time
he
came
to
live
in
america
which
he
said
himself
has
been
my
favourite
country
since
the
age
of
thirteen
when
i
first
saw
it
his
real
name
was
john
paul
but
he
took
the
name
of
jones
out
of
gratitude
to
jones
a
gentleman
of
virginia
who
had
befriended
him
when
he
was
poor
and
in
trouble
when
the
war
of
the
revolution
broke
out
jones
was
a
young
man
of
and
he
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
struggle
on
the
side
of
the
americans
he
was
the
first
man
to
receive
a
naval
commission
after
the
signing
of
the
declaration
of
independence
he
was
too
the
first
man
to
break
the
american
naval
flag
from
the
mast
this
was
not
however
the
stars
and
stripes
but
a
yellow
flag
with
a
pine
tree
and
a
rattlesnake
and
the
words
tread
on
me
how
dares
jones
became
famous
at
once
for
his
deeds
of
skill
and
daring
for
it
was
his
sole
ambition
he
said
to
fight
a
battle
under
the
new
flag
which
will
teach
the
world
that
the
american
flag
means
something
afloat
and
must
be
respected
at
sea
but
he
never
liked
the
yellow
flag
it
was
more
fit
for
a
pirate
ship
he
thought
than
to
be
the
ensign
of
a
great
nation
and
he
it
was
who
first
sailed
under
the
stars
and
stripes
which
he
hoisted
on
his
little
ship
the
ranger
this
was
only
a
vessel
of
three
hundred
tons
in
it
in
november
he
crossed
the
atlantic
harried
the
coasts
of
england
and
scotland
and
then
made
his
way
to
france
from
france
jones
set
out
again
with
a
little
fleet
of
four
ships
his
flagship
he
called
bonhomme
richard
as
a
compliment
both
to
france
and
franklin
franklin
being
the
author
of
poor
almanac
for
which
bonhomme
richard
was
the
french
translation
the
bonhomme
richard
was
the
largest
vessel
of
the
american
navy
but
it
was
only
a
old
east
india
merchantman
turned
into
a
by
having
portholes
for
guns
cut
in
the
sides
and
although
jones
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
the
guns
themselves
had
all
been
condemned
as
unsafe
before
they
were
sent
on
board
the
other
ships
of
the
squadron
were
also
traders
fitted
up
with
guns
in
the
same
way
but
were
all
much
smaller
than
the
bonhomme
with
this
raffish
little
fleet
paul
jones
set
out
to
do
great
deeds
his
bold
plan
was
to
attack
liverpool
the
great
centre
of
shipping
but
that
had
to
be
given
up
for
he
found
it
impossible
to
keep
his
little
squadron
together
sometimes
he
would
only
have
one
other
ship
with
him
sometimes
he
would
be
quite
alone
so
he
cruised
about
the
north
sea
doing
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
british
shipping
catching
merchantmen
and
sending
them
to
france
as
prizes
at
length
one
afternoon
in
september
when
he
had
only
the
pallas
with
him
he
sighted
a
whole
fleet
of
merchantmen
off
the
coast
of
england
and
at
once
gave
chase
the
merchantmen
were
being
convoyed
by
two
british
the
serapis
and
the
countess
of
scarborough
and
they
at
once
got
between
jones
and
his
prey
then
the
merchantmen
made
off
as
fast
as
they
could
and
the
came
on
presently
the
captain
of
the
serapis
hailed
the
bonhomme
richard
what
ship
are
you
he
shouted
i
ca
hear
what
you
say
replied
jones
who
wanted
to
get
nearer
that
made
the
british
captain
suspicious
nearer
and
nearer
the
two
vessels
drew
on
to
each
other
hah
he
said
it
is
probably
paul
jones
if
so
there
is
hot
work
ahead
again
the
serapis
sent
a
hail
what
ship
is
that
answer
immediately
or
i
shall
be
obliged
to
fire
into
you
paul
jones
answered
this
time
with
a
broadside
and
a
terrible
battle
began
the
carnage
was
awful
the
decks
were
soon
cumbered
with
dead
and
dying
the
two
ships
were
so
near
that
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
almost
touched
each
other
both
were
soon
riddled
with
shot
and
leaking
so
that
the
pumps
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
rising
water
still
the
men
fought
on
jones
was
everywhere
firing
guns
himself
encouraging
his
men
cheering
them
with
his
voice
and
his
example
the
commodore
had
but
to
look
at
a
man
to
make
him
brave
said
a
frenchman
who
was
there
such
was
the
power
of
one
heart
that
knew
no
fear
the
sun
went
down
over
the
green
fields
of
england
and
the
great
red
harvest
moon
came
up
still
through
the
calm
moonlit
night
the
guns
thundered
and
a
heavy
cloud
of
smoke
hung
over
the
sea
two
of
the
rotten
old
guns
on
the
bonhomme
richard
had
burst
at
the
first
charge
killing
and
wounding
the
gunners
others
were
soon
utterly
useless
for
a
minute
not
one
could
be
fired
and
the
captain
of
the
serapis
thought
that
the
americans
were
beaten
have
you
struck
he
shouted
through
the
smoke
of
the
battle
no
cried
jones
i
have
begun
to
fight
yet
the
next
instant
the
roar
and
rattle
of
the
musketry
crashed
forth
again
both
ships
were
now
on
fire
and
a
great
hole
smashed
in
the
side
of
the
bonhomme
for
god
sake
strike
captain
said
one
of
his
officers
jones
looked
at
him
silently
for
a
minute
the
he
answered
no
he
cried
i
will
sink
i
will
never
strike
the
ships
were
now
side
by
side
and
jones
gave
orders
to
lash
the
bonhomme
richard
to
the
serapis
he
seized
a
rope
himself
and
helped
to
do
it
the
carpenter
beside
him
finding
the
lines
tangled
rapped
out
a
sailor
oath
but
jones
was
calm
as
if
nothing
was
happening
do
swear
stacy
he
said
we
may
soon
all
be
in
eternity
let
us
do
our
duty
lashed
together
now
the
two
ships
swung
on
the
waves
in
a
death
grapple
the
guns
on
the
bonhomme
richard
were
nearly
all
silenced
but
a
sailor
climbed
out
on
to
the
yards
and
began
to
throw
hand
grenades
into
the
serapis
he
threw
one
right
into
the
hold
where
it
fell
upon
a
heap
of
cartridges
and
exploded
killing
about
twenty
men
that
ended
the
battle
with
his
ship
sinking
and
aflame
and
the
dead
lying
thick
about
him
the
british
captain
struck
his
flag
and
the
americans
boarded
the
serapis
and
took
possession
in
silence
and
bitterness
of
heart
captain
pearson
bowed
and
handed
his
sword
to
jones
but
jones
had
only
admiration
for
his
gallant
foe
he
longed
to
say
something
to
comfort
him
but
he
looked
so
sad
and
dignified
that
he
knew
not
what
to
say
at
length
he
spoke
captain
pearson
he
said
you
have
fought
like
a
hero
you
have
worn
this
sword
to
your
credit
and
to
the
honour
of
your
service
i
hope
your
king
will
reward
you
suitably
but
captain
pearson
could
not
answer
his
heart
was
still
too
sore
without
a
word
he
bowed
again
and
turned
away
while
this
terrible
fight
had
been
going
on
the
pallas
had
engaged
the
countess
of
scarborough
and
captured
her
and
now
appeared
not
much
worse
for
the
fight
but
the
bonhomme
richard
was
an
utter
wreck
and
was
sinking
fast
so
as
quickly
as
possible
the
sailors
utterly
weary
as
they
were
with
fighting
began
to
move
the
wounded
to
the
serapis
the
crew
of
the
british
ship
too
worked
with
a
will
doing
their
best
to
save
the
enemies
of
the
night
before
at
length
all
were
safely
carried
aboard
the
serapis
and
only
the
dead
were
left
on
the
gallant
old
bonhomme
richard
to
them
says
jones
in
his
journal
i
gave
the
good
old
ship
for
their
coffin
and
in
it
they
found
a
sublime
sepulchre
and
the
last
mortal
eyes
ever
saw
of
the
bonhomme
richard
was
the
defiant
waving
of
her
unconquered
and
unstricken
flag
as
she
went
down
so
this
strange
was
over
the
victorious
ship
went
down
and
the
victorious
captain
sailed
away
in
his
prize
but
the
serapis
too
was
little
more
than
a
wreck
her
main
mast
was
shot
away
her
other
masts
and
spars
were
badly
damaged
and
could
carry
but
little
sail
and
it
seemed
doubtful
if
she
would
ever
reach
port
but
after
a
perilous
journey
the
coasts
of
holland
were
sighted
and
the
serapis
was
duly
anchored
in
the
texel
with
deeds
like
these
the
little
american
navy
realised
desire
but
beyond
that
they
did
little
to
bring
the
war
to
an
end
far
more
was
done
by
the
privateers
which
were
fitted
out
by
the
hundred
they
scoured
the
seas
like
greyhounds
attacking
british
merchantmen
on
every
trade
route
capturing
and
sinking
as
many
as
three
hundred
in
one
year
this
kind
of
warfare
paid
so
well
indeed
that
farming
was
almost
given
up
in
many
states
the
farmers
having
all
gone
off
to
make
their
fortunes
by
capturing
british
merchantmen
as
for
paul
jones
he
never
had
a
chance
again
of
showing
his
great
prowess
when
the
war
was
over
he
entered
the
service
of
russia
and
became
an
admiral
he
died
in
paris
in
but
for
a
long
time
it
was
not
known
where
he
was
buried
his
grave
was
discovered
in
and
his
body
was
brought
to
america
by
a
squadron
of
the
navy
which
was
sent
to
france
for
the
purpose
and
reburied
at
annapolis
with
the
honour
due
to
a
hero
chapter
the
battle
of
monmouth
the
story
of
captain
molly
while
the
americans
were
learning
endurance
in
the
hard
school
of
valley
forge
the
british
were
having
a
gay
time
in
philadelphia
the
grave
old
quaker
town
rang
with
song
and
laughter
as
never
before
balls
and
parties
theatricals
and
races
followed
each
other
in
a
constant
round
of
gaiety
and
amid
this
jollity
howe
seemed
to
forget
all
about
the
war
had
he
chosen
he
could
easily
have
attacked
valley
forge
and
crushed
washington
perishing
army
out
of
existence
or
if
he
grudged
to
lose
men
in
an
attack
he
might
have
surrounded
the
americans
and
starved
them
into
submission
but
he
did
neither
he
was
too
comfortable
in
his
winter
quarters
and
had
no
wish
to
go
out
in
the
snow
to
fight
battles
those
in
power
in
england
had
long
been
dissatisfied
with
way
of
conducting
the
war
time
and
again
he
had
seemed
to
lose
his
chance
of
crushing
the
rebellion
and
now
this
idle
and
gay
winter
in
philadelphia
seemed
the
last
straw
such
bitter
things
indeed
were
said
of
him
that
he
resigned
his
commission
and
went
home
and
the
supreme
command
was
given
to
general
clinton
now
that
france
had
joined
with
america
britain
was
in
a
very
different
position
than
before
she
could
no
longer
afford
to
send
out
large
armies
such
as
howe
had
been
given
to
subdue
the
colonies
for
she
had
to
keep
troops
at
home
to
protect
great
britain
from
invasion
she
had
to
send
ships
and
men
all
over
the
word
to
repel
the
attacks
of
the
french
on
her
scattered
colonies
and
possessions
clinton
therefore
was
left
with
only
an
army
of
about
ten
thousand
and
with
this
force
he
was
expected
to
conquer
the
country
which
howe
had
been
unable
to
conquer
with
thirty
thousand
clinton
knew
that
his
task
was
a
hard
one
he
saw
that
the
taking
of
philadelphia
had
been
a
mistake
and
that
from
a
military
point
of
view
it
was
worthless
so
he
decided
at
once
to
abandon
philadelphia
and
take
his
army
back
to
new
york
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
the
british
marched
out
a
few
days
later
congress
returned
and
the
city
settled
back
to
its
quiet
old
life
once
more
it
was
no
easy
task
for
clinton
to
cross
new
jersey
in
grilling
summer
weather
with
a
small
force
an
enormous
baggage
train
and
washington
hanging
threateningly
about
is
path
harassing
him
at
every
step
that
he
did
accomplish
it
brought
him
no
little
renown
as
a
soldier
for
some
time
following
the
advice
of
his
officers
washington
did
not
make
a
general
attack
on
the
british
but
near
the
town
of
monmouth
he
saw
his
chance
and
determined
to
give
battle
general
lee
had
by
this
time
been
exchanged
and
was
now
again
with
washington
army
as
second
in
command
and
for
this
battle
washington
gave
him
command
of
an
advance
party
of
six
thousand
men
with
him
were
anthony
wayne
and
lafayette
on
the
morning
of
the
battle
lee
division
was
in
a
very
good
position
it
seemed
as
if
the
british
might
be
surrounded
with
ease
but
when
wayne
and
lafayette
were
about
to
attack
lee
stopped
them
you
do
not
know
british
soldiers
he
said
to
lafayette
we
are
certain
to
be
driven
back
we
must
be
cautious
that
may
be
so
general
replied
lafayette
but
british
soldiers
have
been
beaten
and
may
be
so
again
at
any
rate
i
should
like
to
try
but
for
answer
lee
ordered
his
men
to
retreat
at
this
lafayette
was
both
angry
and
astonished
and
he
hurriedly
sent
a
message
to
washington
telling
him
that
his
presence
was
urgently
needed
the
soldiers
did
not
in
the
least
know
from
what
they
were
retreating
and
they
soon
fell
into
disorder
then
suddenly
washington
appeared
among
them
he
was
white
to
the
lips
with
wrath
i
desire
to
know
he
said
in
a
terrible
voice
turning
to
lee
i
desire
to
know
sir
what
is
the
reason
whence
arises
this
disorder
and
confusion
lee
trembled
before
the
awful
anger
of
his
chief
he
tried
to
make
excuses
then
washington
fury
knew
no
bounds
he
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
wrath
upon
lee
till
as
one
of
his
officers
who
heard
him
said
the
very
leaves
shook
on
the
trees
then
halting
the
retreating
troops
he
formed
them
for
battle
once
more
later
in
the
day
meeting
lee
he
sent
him
to
the
rear
soon
the
battle
was
raging
fiercely
some
of
the
hottest
fighting
took
place
round
the
american
artillery
which
was
commanded
by
general
knox
the
guns
were
doing
deadly
work
yet
moving
about
coolly
amidst
the
din
and
smoke
of
battle
there
might
be
seen
a
saucy
young
irish
girl
with
a
mop
of
red
hair
a
freckled
face
and
flashing
eyes
she
was
the
wife
of
one
of
the
gunners
and
so
devoted
was
she
to
her
husband
that
she
followed
him
even
to
battle
helping
him
constantly
with
his
gun
his
comrades
looked
upon
her
almost
as
one
of
the
regiment
and
called
her
captain
molly
and
she
wore
an
artilleryman
coat
over
her
short
red
skirt
so
that
she
might
look
like
a
soldier
captain
molly
was
returning
from
a
spring
nearby
with
a
bucket
full
of
water
when
her
husband
who
was
just
about
to
fire
was
killed
by
a
shot
from
the
enemy
the
officer
in
command
having
no
one
to
take
his
place
ordered
the
gun
to
be
removed
molly
saw
her
husband
fall
heard
the
command
given
and
she
dropped
her
bucket
and
sprang
to
the
gun
bedad
no
she
cried
i
fire
the
gun
myself
and
avenge
my
man
death
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
molly
had
fired
a
gun
she
was
with
her
husband
at
fort
clinton
when
it
was
taken
by
the
british
as
the
enemy
scaled
the
walls
the
americans
retreated
her
husband
dropped
his
lighted
match
and
fled
with
the
rest
but
captain
molly
was
in
no
such
haste
she
picked
up
the
match
fired
the
gun
and
then
ran
after
the
others
hers
was
the
last
gun
fired
on
the
american
side
that
day
now
all
the
long
day
of
monmouth
she
kept
her
gun
in
action
firing
so
skillfully
and
bravely
that
all
around
were
filled
with
admiration
and
news
of
her
deeds
was
carried
through
the
army
even
washington
heard
of
them
next
day
he
ordered
her
to
be
brought
to
him
and
there
and
then
he
made
her
a
sergeant
and
recommended
her
for
an
officer
pension
for
life
but
now
that
her
husband
was
dead
molly
heart
was
no
longer
with
the
army
soon
after
the
battle
of
monmouth
she
left
it
and
a
few
years
later
she
died
all
through
the
long
summer
day
of
pitiless
heat
the
battle
raged
again
and
again
the
british
charged
again
and
again
they
were
thrown
back
and
at
length
were
driven
across
a
ravine
here
washington
would
have
followed
but
the
sun
went
down
and
darkness
put
an
end
to
the
fight
washington
however
was
determined
to
renew
the
battle
next
day
and
that
night
the
army
slept
on
the
field
he
himself
slept
under
a
tree
sharing
a
cloak
with
lafayette
but
the
battle
was
never
renewed
for
during
the
night
clinton
marched
quietly
away
when
day
dawned
he
was
already
too
far
off
to
pursue
and
at
length
he
got
safely
into
new
york
this
was
the
last
great
battle
to
be
fought
in
the
northern
states
and
a
few
weeks
later
washington
took
up
his
quarters
on
white
plains
there
for
nearly
three
years
he
stayed
guarding
the
great
waterway
of
the
hudson
and
preventing
the
british
from
making
any
further
advance
in
the
north
chapter
the
story
of
a
great
crime
for
his
strange
conduct
at
the
battle
of
monmouth
general
lee
was
and
deprived
of
his
command
for
one
year
before
the
year
was
out
however
he
quarreled
with
congress
and
was
expelled
from
the
army
altogether
so
his
soldiering
days
were
done
and
he
retired
to
his
farm
in
virginia
he
was
still
looked
upon
as
a
patriot
even
if
an
incompetent
soldier
but
many
years
after
his
death
some
letters
that
he
had
written
to
howe
were
found
these
proved
him
to
have
been
a
traitor
to
the
american
cause
for
in
them
he
gave
the
british
commander
advice
as
to
how
the
americans
cold
best
be
conquered
thus
his
strange
conduct
at
the
battle
of
monmouth
was
explained
he
had
always
given
his
voice
against
attacking
the
british
on
their
way
to
new
york
and
doubtless
he
thought
that
if
washington
had
been
defeated
he
could
have
proved
that
it
was
because
his
advice
had
not
been
followed
if
in
consequence
washington
command
had
been
taken
from
him
he
would
have
been
made
and
cold
have
easily
arranged
terms
of
peace
with
the
british
but
his
plans
miscarried
he
lived
to
see
american
victorious
but
died
before
peace
was
signed
lee
was
a
traitor
but
he
had
never
been
a
real
american
he
had
taken
the
american
side
merely
for
his
own
glory
and
had
never
done
anything
for
it
worthy
of
record
but
now
a
true
american
one
who
had
fought
brilliantly
and
gallantly
for
this
country
turned
traitor
and
blackened
his
fair
name
blotting
out
his
brave
deeds
for
all
time
when
the
americans
took
possession
of
philadelphia
again
benedict
arnold
was
still
too
crippled
by
his
wound
to
be
able
for
active
service
so
the
command
of
philadelphia
was
given
to
him
there
he
soon
got
into
trouble
he
began
to
live
extravagantly
and
grew
short
of
money
he
quarreled
with
the
state
government
and
with
congress
was
accused
of
inviting
loyalists
to
his
house
of
getting
money
by
dishonest
acts
and
of
being
in
many
ways
untrue
to
his
duty
he
also
married
a
beautiful
young
loyalist
lady
and
that
was
another
offence
arnold
was
arrogant
and
sensitive
he
grew
restive
under
all
these
accusations
and
demanded
an
enquiry
his
demand
was
granted
and
a
although
acquitting
him
of
everything
except
imprudence
sentenced
him
to
be
reprimanded
by
the
washington
loved
his
gallant
officer
and
his
reprimand
was
so
gentle
and
kind
that
it
seemed
more
like
praise
than
blame
but
even
washington
gracious
words
chafed
proud
spirit
he
was
hurt
and
angry
he
had
deserved
well
of
his
country
and
he
was
reprimanded
he
had
fought
gallantly
and
had
been
passed
over
for
others
he
had
been
twice
wounded
in
his
country
service
and
he
was
rewarded
by
jealousy
caviling
and
a
soon
these
feelings
of
bitterness
turned
to
thoughts
of
treachery
when
exactly
is
not
known
but
turn
they
did
and
arnold
began
in
secret
to
write
letters
to
general
clinton
the
british
in
the
summer
of
his
wound
still
making
him
unfit
for
active
service
arnold
was
given
command
of
the
fortress
of
west
point
which
guarded
the
approaches
to
the
hudson
valley
this
fortress
he
agreed
to
betray
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
thus
give
them
command
of
that
valley
for
which
burgoyne
had
made
such
a
gallant
and
hopeless
fight
for
a
long
time
arnold
carried
on
a
secret
correspondence
with
major
andré
a
british
officer
and
at
length
a
meeting
between
them
was
arranged
one
september
night
arnold
waited
until
all
was
still
and
dark
in
the
fort
then
stealthily
he
crept
forth
and
reached
in
safety
a
clump
of
trees
on
the
bank
of
the
hudson
just
beyond
the
american
lines
here
he
lay
waiting
soon
through
the
darkness
the
british
warship
the
vulture
crept
up
the
river
presently
arnold
heard
the
soft
splash
of
oars
and
in
a
few
minutes
major
andré
stepped
ashore
for
hours
the
two
conspirators
talked
until
at
length
all
details
of
the
plot
were
settled
but
day
had
dawned
before
arnold
returned
to
west
point
and
andré
set
out
to
regain
the
vulture
with
plans
of
the
fort
and
all
other
particulars
hidden
in
his
boots
by
this
time
however
the
batteries
on
shore
had
begun
to
fire
upon
the
ship
and
andré
finding
it
impossible
to
get
on
board
decided
to
go
back
to
new
york
by
land
it
was
a
dangerous
journey
but
for
a
little
while
he
crept
on
unseen
then
suddenly
his
way
was
barred
by
three
americans
and
he
found
himself
a
prisoner
have
you
any
letters
asked
his
captors
no
he
answered
they
were
not
satisfied
with
his
answer
and
began
to
search
him
but
finding
nothing
they
were
just
about
to
let
him
go
when
one
of
them
said
i
not
satisfied
boys
his
boots
must
come
off
andré
made
every
kind
of
excuse
to
prevent
them
taking
off
his
boots
they
were
hard
to
pull
off
he
said
and
it
would
take
a
long
time
he
was
already
late
so
he
begged
them
not
to
hinder
him
more
but
the
more
unwilling
he
was
to
take
off
his
boots
the
more
determined
were
his
captors
that
they
should
come
off
so
they
forced
him
to
sit
down
his
boots
were
pulled
off
and
the
papers
discovered
only
one
of
the
three
americans
could
read
he
seized
the
papers
and
glanced
hastily
over
them
by
heaven
he
cried
he
is
a
spy
it
was
in
vain
that
andré
now
begged
to
be
set
free
first
he
tried
persuasion
and
when
that
failed
he
tried
bribery
but
his
captors
would
not
listen
and
marched
him
off
to
headquarters
arnold
was
just
about
to
sit
down
to
breakfast
with
some
other
officers
as
his
guests
washington
being
expected
every
minute
to
join
them
when
a
letter
was
handed
to
him
telling
him
that
a
spy
had
been
captured
it
was
an
awful
moment
for
arnold
if
andré
was
captured
then
all
too
surely
his
own
treachery
was
known
he
could
not
stay
to
face
the
disgrace
but
he
made
no
sign
he
calmly
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
saying
that
he
had
been
suddenly
called
to
the
fort
he
begged
his
guests
to
excuse
him
and
went
out
and
mounting
the
horse
of
the
messenger
who
had
brought
the
letter
he
sped
away
never
staying
his
flight
until
he
was
safe
aboard
the
vulture
very
soon
after
arnold
had
escaped
washington
arrived
and
when
the
traitorous
papers
which
had
been
found
in
andré
possession
were
placed
in
his
hands
he
was
overcome
with
grief
arnold
is
a
traitor
and
has
fled
to
the
british
he
said
whom
can
we
trust
now
as
he
spoke
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
bitter
tears
rung
from
his
noble
soul
at
the
thought
of
this
one
more
and
sorrow
for
angels
the
chief
sinner
had
escaped
but
he
had
left
his
fellow
conspirator
to
pay
his
debt
for
a
spy
could
expect
no
mercy
andré
was
young
brave
and
gay
he
had
such
winning
ways
with
him
that
even
his
captors
came
to
love
him
and
they
grieved
that
such
a
gay
young
life
must
be
brought
to
a
sudden
and
dreadful
end
his
many
friends
did
their
best
to
save
him
but
their
efforts
were
all
in
vain
nothing
could
alter
the
fact
that
he
was
a
spy
caught
in
the
act
and
the
punishment
was
death
so
one
morning
andré
was
led
out
to
die
he
begged
to
shot
as
a
soldier
and
not
hanged
like
a
felon
but
even
that
was
denied
him
calm
and
brave
to
the
end
he
met
his
death
when
arnold
treachery
was
known
a
cry
of
rage
rang
through
the
country
yet
in
spite
of
his
foul
deed
people
could
not
quite
forget
how
nobly
he
had
fought
hang
him
they
cried
but
cut
off
the
leg
that
was
wounded
at
saratoga
first
arnold
however
was
beyond
their
vengeance
safe
in
the
british
lines
there
he
at
once
received
a
commission
and
turned
his
sword
against
his
own
country
thus
a
brave
man
cast
his
valour
in
the
dust
and
made
his
name
a
scorn
and
a
but
who
shall
say
that
the
men
who
belittled
his
deeds
and
followed
him
with
jealousy
and
carping
were
wholly
blameless
chapter
a
turning
point
in
the
world
history
after
nearly
four
years
fighting
the
british
had
utterly
failed
to
subdue
the
rebel
colonies
they
had
lost
one
whole
army
had
poured
out
treasures
of
blood
and
money
and
all
they
had
in
return
was
new
york
and
the
coast
town
of
newport
besides
this
they
were
at
war
with
half
europe
for
in
spain
declared
war
against
britain
more
indeed
from
anger
against
the
british
than
from
any
love
of
the
americans
the
following
year
holland
also
declared
war
against
britain
who
thus
found
herself
surrounded
by
foes
still
in
spite
of
all
the
british
stuck
doggedly
to
their
task
of
conquering
the
americans
but
as
pitt
had
told
them
again
and
again
it
was
an
impossible
task
at
length
having
failed
to
make
any
impression
in
the
north
they
decided
to
change
the
seat
of
war
and
attack
the
weaker
colonies
in
the
south
here
for
a
time
they
were
more
successful
georgia
was
overrun
then
south
carolina
and
charleston
which
had
made
such
a
brave
defence
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
surrendered
to
the
british
with
all
its
stores
of
food
and
ammunition
things
were
going
badly
for
the
patriots
in
the
south
and
gates
who
was
still
looked
upon
as
a
hero
because
burgoyne
had
surrendered
to
him
was
sent
to
take
command
now
he
had
a
chance
to
prove
of
what
stuff
he
was
made
he
proved
it
by
being
utterly
defeated
at
the
battle
of
camden
this
defeat
was
a
bitter
blow
never
since
before
the
battle
of
trenton
had
the
patriot
cause
seemed
so
much
in
danger
but
the
dark
days
passed
and
once
more
the
americans
began
to
win
instead
of
lose
battles
south
carolina
was
and
cornwallis
who
was
of
the
british
army
in
the
south
retired
into
virginia
and
occupied
yorktown
just
at
this
time
washington
learned
that
a
french
fleet
was
sailing
for
chesapeake
bay
and
he
determined
to
make
a
grand
attack
on
the
british
in
the
south
he
made
his
plans
very
secretly
and
leaving
general
heath
with
four
thousand
men
to
guard
the
hudson
he
marched
southwards
moving
with
such
quickness
that
he
had
reached
the
delaware
before
clinton
in
new
york
knew
what
he
was
about
his
army
now
consisted
of
two
thousand
americans
and
four
thousand
french
and
this
was
the
only
time
throughout
the
war
that
french
and
americans
marched
together
on
the
of
october
the
siege
of
yorktown
began
it
was
soon
seen
that
its
defenses
were
of
no
use
against
the
seventy
heavy
siege
guns
of
the
allied
army
and
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
was
only
a
matter
of
time
for
he
was
caught
in
a
trap
just
as
burgoyne
had
been
he
could
not
escape
to
the
south
for
lafayette
barred
the
way
to
the
carolinas
he
could
not
escape
by
sea
for
the
french
and
british
fleets
had
fought
a
battle
at
the
entrance
of
chesapeake
bay
in
which
the
british
ships
had
been
so
badly
damaged
that
they
were
obliged
to
sail
to
new
york
to
refit
he
could
not
escape
to
the
north
or
the
east
for
washington
army
shut
him
in
still
for
a
few
days
the
british
made
a
gallant
stand
but
their
ammunition
was
running
short
their
defenses
were
crumbling
to
bits
and
on
the
of
october
almost
four
years
to
a
day
after
burgoyne
surrender
to
gates
cornwallis
surrendered
to
washington
two
days
later
the
british
soldiers
marched
out
with
flags
furled
while
the
bands
played
a
tune
called
the
world
turned
upside
down
to
them
indeed
the
world
must
have
seemed
turned
upside
down
for
the
british
had
been
conquered
at
last
and
that
by
a
nation
of
farmers
unskilled
in
war
yet
they
may
have
found
some
comfort
in
the
thought
that
after
all
they
had
been
beaten
by
their
equals
by
men
of
their
own
race
on
either
side
there
was
the
same
grit
and
endurance
the
same
love
of
fair
play
but
added
to
that
the
americans
had
fought
for
a
great
cause
their
hearts
were
in
it
as
the
hearts
of
the
british
had
never
been
this
was
their
great
advantage
this
nerved
their
arm
for
two
years
after
this
clinton
still
held
new
york
but
there
was
no
more
fighting
between
the
regular
armies
and
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
may
be
said
to
have
ended
the
war
when
lord
north
heard
the
news
he
was
distracted
with
grief
he
dashed
wildly
up
and
down
the
room
waving
his
arms
and
crying
over
and
over
again
o
god
it
is
all
over
it
is
all
over
as
for
king
george
he
would
not
admit
that
it
was
all
over
and
he
swore
he
would
rather
give
up
his
crown
than
acknowledge
the
states
to
be
free
but
at
length
he
too
had
to
give
way
and
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
in
paris
in
november
this
peace
however
was
only
a
first
step
for
europe
was
still
at
war
and
it
was
difficult
to
settle
matters
but
in
september
of
the
following
year
the
real
peace
was
signed
and
the
united
states
were
acknowledged
to
be
free
by
this
treaty
florida
was
given
back
to
spain
the
mississippi
was
made
the
western
boundary
and
the
great
lakes
the
northern
boundary
of
the
united
states
thus
a
new
great
power
came
into
being
and
as
an
english
historian
has
said
the
world
had
reached
one
of
the
turning
points
of
its
history
part
vii
stories
of
the
united
states
under
the
constitution
chapter
washington
first
in
war
first
in
peace
after
the
peace
was
signed
in
september
all
the
british
soldiers
left
america
and
washington
felt
that
his
work
was
done
so
he
resolved
to
give
up
his
post
as
and
go
back
to
his
pleasant
virginian
home
he
was
glad
at
the
thought
of
going
back
to
the
home
he
loved
yet
sad
at
the
thought
of
saying
farewell
to
his
officers
for
eight
years
they
had
worked
for
him
faithfully
together
they
had
faced
dark
days
together
they
had
been
through
deep
waters
and
now
that
victory
was
won
washington
heart
was
filled
with
love
and
gratitude
it
was
at
faunces
tavern
in
new
york
that
washington
met
his
officers
for
the
last
time
when
he
came
into
the
long
low
room
where
they
were
all
gathered
he
was
so
moved
that
he
could
not
speak
silently
he
went
to
the
table
and
filled
a
glass
with
wine
raising
it
he
turned
to
the
men
who
stood
as
silently
about
him
and
with
an
effort
commanding
his
voice
he
spoke
with
a
heart
full
of
love
and
gratitude
he
said
i
now
take
leave
of
you
most
devoutly
wishing
that
your
latter
days
may
be
as
prosperous
and
happy
as
your
former
ones
have
been
glorious
and
honourable
then
having
drunk
to
the
toast
he
set
the
glass
down
i
can
not
come
to
each
of
you
to
take
my
leave
he
said
brokenly
but
shall
be
obliged
if
each
of
you
will
come
and
take
me
by
the
hand
the
general
who
was
nearest
to
washington
then
turned
to
him
and
silently
grasped
his
hand
with
tears
in
his
eyes
washington
put
his
arms
about
him
and
kissed
him
and
thus
one
after
the
other
his
officers
silently
said
no
one
of
them
trusting
himself
to
speak
then
still
in
silence
they
followed
him
to
the
boat
which
was
to
carry
him
on
the
first
part
of
his
way
to
annapolis
where
congress
was
assembled
and
where
he
was
to
lay
down
his
sword
his
journey
was
like
a
royal
progress
in
every
town
and
village
through
which
he
passed
the
people
gathered
to
cheer
and
bless
him
so
he
reached
annapolis
there
before
congress
he
resigned
his
commission
then
with
a
sigh
of
relief
a
simple
citizen
once
more
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
homewards
but
now
the
colonies
which
had
wrung
themselves
free
from
the
rule
of
britain
were
not
altogether
happy
they
called
themselves
the
united
states
but
there
was
little
union
before
the
revolution
there
had
been
much
jealousy
between
the
various
states
for
a
time
indeed
in
the
heat
of
the
struggle
they
had
forgotten
these
differences
but
now
that
the
struggle
was
over
and
peace
had
come
these
jealousies
appeared
again
each
state
had
its
own
government
its
own
taxes
its
own
money
so
there
was
great
confusion
but
no
state
wanted
to
give
up
any
of
its
privileges
and
it
seemed
hopeless
to
institute
one
central
government
for
each
state
thought
only
of
itself
and
each
one
was
afraid
of
giving
congress
too
much
power
lest
it
should
usurp
the
power
of
the
state
government
the
states
quarreled
with
each
other
about
their
boundaries
some
of
them
made
absurd
claims
to
vast
territory
on
the
strength
of
their
royal
charters
quite
forgetting
that
these
charters
were
now
done
away
with
there
were
riots
everywhere
indeed
never
was
the
state
in
such
danger
of
shipwreck
as
now
at
its
very
beginning
washington
from
his
quiet
retreat
at
first
watched
the
struggle
anxiously
but
not
despairingly
everything
will
come
right
at
last
he
said
my
only
fear
is
that
we
shall
lose
a
little
reputation
first
as
time
went
on
however
he
grew
more
anxious
i
think
we
have
opposed
great
britain
he
said
and
have
arrived
at
the
present
state
of
peace
and
independency
to
very
little
purpose
if
we
can
not
conquer
our
own
prejudices
but
washington
had
no
real
need
to
fear
the
men
who
had
fought
for
their
freedom
proved
themselves
worthy
of
it
and
in
may
a
meeting
of
all
the
states
was
called
at
philadelphia
of
this
convention
as
it
was
called
washington
was
chosen
president
it
was
no
easy
post
nor
was
the
business
for
which
the
members
of
the
convention
were
called
together
a
simple
business
they
had
indeed
a
very
great
task
to
perform
the
task
of
forming
a
new
constitution
or
mode
of
government
which
all
states
would
accept
it
was
not
easy
to
please
every
one
and
also
do
thoroughly
good
work
so
for
four
months
the
convention
sat
discussing
this
and
that
listening
now
to
one
side
now
to
another
weighing
judging
and
deciding
but
at
length
the
thing
was
done
in
the
same
hall
where
the
declaration
of
independence
had
been
signed
the
constitution
had
been
framed
then
the
delegates
went
home
and
a
copy
of
the
constitution
was
sent
to
each
state
it
had
been
agreed
that
nine
states
must
accept
the
constitution
before
it
could
become
law
the
question
now
was
whether
nine
would
accept
it
or
not
many
hesitated
a
long
time
for
it
seemed
to
them
that
this
new
constitution
which
was
going
to
unite
all
the
states
into
one
was
going
also
to
give
far
too
much
power
into
the
hands
of
a
few
people
it
would
be
a
case
of
tyranny
over
again
many
feared
and
having
suffered
so
much
to
free
themselves
from
one
tyranny
they
were
not
ready
to
place
themselves
under
a
second
but
others
at
once
saw
the
need
of
a
strong
central
government
and
accepted
the
new
constitution
and
almost
at
once
delaware
had
the
honour
of
coming
first
early
in
december
but
before
the
month
was
gone
two
more
states
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey
followed
the
good
example
a
week
or
so
later
came
georgia
and
then
connecticut
after
a
good
deal
of
hesitation
massachusetts
also
came
into
line
then
maryland
and
south
carolina
only
one
more
state
was
now
needed
to
make
the
union
safe
would
that
one
state
come
in
the
friends
of
union
asked
themselves
and
they
worked
their
hardest
to
make
people
think
as
they
did
at
length
their
efforts
were
rewarded
and
new
hampshire
made
the
ninth
and
just
four
days
later
the
great
state
of
virginia
also
came
in
new
york
soon
followed
and
only
north
carolina
and
rhode
island
remained
out
of
the
union
but
in
time
they
too
came
in
rhode
island
last
of
all
and
not
for
fully
a
year
after
the
first
president
had
been
chosen
and
the
government
organised
the
new
government
required
that
there
should
be
a
congress
to
look
after
the
affairs
of
the
nation
with
two
houses
something
after
the
fashion
of
the
british
parliament
it
also
required
that
there
should
be
a
president
at
the
head
of
everything
there
was
little
doubt
as
to
who
should
fill
that
place
george
washington
the
man
who
had
led
the
army
to
victory
was
the
man
chosen
to
be
first
president
of
the
united
states
other
people
were
indeed
voted
for
but
washington
had
more
than
twice
as
many
votes
as
john
adams
who
came
next
to
him
the
others
were
simply
nowhere
so
washington
was
made
president
and
adams
but
washington
had
no
wish
to
be
president
he
was
too
old
he
said
he
was
only
and
besides
he
was
not
even
a
statesman
but
a
soldier
the
people
however
would
not
listen
to
him
we
can
not
do
without
you
they
said
there
is
no
use
framing
a
new
government
if
the
best
man
is
to
be
left
out
of
it
so
to
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
washington
yielded
but
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
for
he
greatly
doubted
his
own
powers
in
confidence
i
tell
you
he
wrote
to
an
old
friend
that
my
movement
to
the
chair
of
government
will
be
accompanied
by
feelings
not
unlike
those
of
a
culprit
who
is
going
to
the
place
of
his
execution
but
whatever
he
felt
his
journey
to
new
york
was
not
like
that
of
a
criminal
but
rather
like
that
of
a
king
from
far
and
near
the
people
crowded
to
see
him
pass
they
raised
triumphal
arches
they
scattered
flowers
at
his
feet
they
sang
chants
and
hymns
in
his
honour
from
first
to
last
it
was
one
long
triumph
when
he
reached
new
york
bells
rang
and
cannon
boomed
the
streets
were
gay
with
flags
and
crowded
with
people
and
as
he
passed
along
cheer
upon
cheer
thundered
and
echoed
over
the
city
next
day
the
of
april
washington
took
his
place
as
president
of
the
united
states
at
nine
in
the
morning
the
churches
were
thronged
with
people
praying
for
the
welfare
of
their
president
by
twelve
these
same
people
were
all
crowding
to
the
federal
hall
eager
to
be
present
at
the
great
ceremony
soon
the
space
in
front
of
the
hall
was
one
closely
packed
mass
of
people
every
window
and
balcony
was
crowded
also
and
people
were
even
to
be
seen
on
the
roofs
a
little
after
noon
washington
reached
the
hall
and
as
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
a
cheer
of
welcome
burst
from
the
gathered
thousands
again
and
again
they
cheered
again
and
again
washington
bowed
in
acknowledgement
he
was
greatly
touched
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
at
length
utterly
overcome
he
sat
down
suddenly
a
deep
hush
fell
upon
the
swaying
crowd
and
after
a
slight
pause
washington
rose
again
then
in
the
grave
silence
the
voice
of
robert
livingston
the
chancellor
of
new
york
could
clearly
be
heard
do
you
he
asked
solemnly
swear
that
you
will
faithfully
execute
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
and
will
to
the
best
of
your
ability
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
with
his
hand
upon
the
bible
which
the
secretary
of
the
senate
held
beside
him
washington
replied
i
do
solemnly
swear
he
said
that
i
will
faithfully
execute
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
and
will
to
the
best
of
my
ability
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
then
bowing
his
head
he
kissed
the
bible
help
before
him
so
help
me
god
he
murmured
the
chancellor
then
stepped
forward
and
in
a
ringing
voice
he
shouted
long
live
george
washington
president
of
the
united
states
a
great
answering
shout
went
up
from
the
people
the
flag
was
broken
to
the
breeze
and
cannon
boomed
forth
a
salute
to
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
again
and
again
washington
bowed
his
thanks
to
the
cheering
people
then
shaken
with
emotion
the
shouts
still
sounding
in
his
ears
he
turned
away
and
entered
the
hall
to
read
his
address
thus
the
story
of
the
united
states
under
the
constitution
was
begun
washington
was
a
thorough
aristocrat
and
now
that
he
had
been
chosen
head
of
the
state
he
felt
that
he
must
surround
himself
with
a
certain
amount
of
ceremony
now
he
no
longer
walked
or
rode
abroad
but
drove
about
in
a
fine
coach
drawn
by
six
white
horses
he
no
longer
went
to
see
people
but
they
came
to
him
on
certain
days
and
at
appointed
times
when
he
held
receptions
he
dressed
himself
splendidly
in
black
velvet
with
silk
stockings
he
wore
a
jeweled
sword
at
his
side
and
buckles
both
at
the
knee
and
on
his
shoes
instead
of
shaking
hands
with
people
he
merely
bowed
all
this
ceremony
and
state
came
easily
to
washington
even
as
a
simple
virginian
gentleman
he
had
been
used
to
a
certain
amount
of
it
for
in
those
days
plain
gentleman
folk
were
much
more
ceremonious
than
they
are
today
besides
kings
always
surrounded
themselves
with
a
great
deal
of
state
and
it
seemed
to
washington
that
a
ruler
must
do
so
to
keep
up
the
high
dignity
of
his
office
the
first
president
post
was
no
easy
one
the
whole
machinery
of
government
had
to
be
invented
and
set
going
and
first
and
foremost
the
money
matters
had
to
be
set
straight
they
were
in
a
great
muddle
the
war
had
cost
a
great
deal
so
the
new
government
began
in
debt
and
nearly
every
separate
state
was
also
in
debt
but
a
clever
man
named
alexander
hamilton
took
hold
of
the
money
matters
and
soon
put
them
right
among
other
things
he
said
that
the
government
must
take
over
the
war
debts
of
all
the
states
at
once
the
states
made
an
outcry
if
we
allow
the
government
to
pay
our
debts
they
said
we
become
slaves
to
the
government
if
we
give
up
control
of
our
own
money
matters
the
government
will
have
too
much
power
over
us
we
put
too
much
power
in
the
hands
of
a
few
then
they
talked
of
tyranny
you
see
many
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
rightly
or
wrongly
had
come
to
look
upon
any
government
as
certain
to
be
tyrannous
however
hamilton
got
his
way
in
the
end
the
money
matters
of
the
nation
were
settled
satisfactorily
and
the
separate
states
bound
more
securely
together
and
now
another
state
joined
the
union
that
of
vermont
vermont
as
you
can
see
if
you
look
on
the
map
lies
between
new
hampshire
and
new
york
and
there
had
been
bitter
disputes
between
the
two
over
the
land
which
both
claimed
in
however
king
george
iii
had
decided
that
the
land
belonged
to
new
york
and
must
be
under
the
rule
of
that
colony
the
people
however
rebelled
and
when
in
the
governor
of
new
york
threatened
to
drive
them
all
into
the
green
mountains
if
they
did
not
yield
peaceably
they
raised
an
army
of
volunteers
to
whom
they
gave
the
name
of
green
mountain
boys
they
took
this
name
from
the
word
vermont
which
meant
green
mountain
the
green
mountain
boys
fought
the
new
york
governor
and
declared
vermont
a
separate
colony
now
these
old
quarrels
were
forgotten
new
york
no
longer
claimed
the
land
and
vermont
joined
the
union
as
the
fourteenth
state
in
the
following
year
another
state
was
added
to
the
union
this
was
the
state
of
kentucky
it
was
like
several
other
states
an
offshoot
of
virginia
and
carved
out
of
the
territory
which
virginia
claimed
by
right
of
her
old
charter
which
gave
her
all
the
land
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
among
the
early
settlers
of
kentucky
was
a
famous
hunter
named
daniel
boone
he
was
a
gentle
kindly
man
who
loved
the
forest
and
the
loneliness
of
the
wilderness
all
the
lore
of
the
forest
was
his
he
knew
the
haunts
and
habits
of
every
living
thing
that
moved
within
the
woods
he
could
imitate
the
gobble
of
the
turkey
or
the
chatter
of
a
squirrel
and
follow
a
trail
better
than
any
indian
it
was
with
no
idea
of
helping
to
found
a
state
but
rather
from
a
wish
to
get
far
from
the
haunts
of
his
fellowmen
that
he
moved
away
into
the
beautiful
wilds
of
kentucky
in
those
days
kentucky
was
not
inhabited
by
any
tribe
of
indians
but
it
was
their
hunting
ground
and
they
were
very
angry
when
they
saw
white
men
come
to
settle
there
and
spoil
their
hunting
so
boone
had
many
fierce
fights
with
indians
and
was
more
than
once
taken
prisoner
by
them
many
other
settlers
followed
boone
and
after
the
revolution
many
virginians
moved
to
kentucky
these
people
soon
became
clamorous
for
separation
from
virginia
and
at
last
in
kentucky
was
received
into
the
union
as
a
separate
state
and
now
the
question
of
a
suitable
capital
for
the
united
states
began
to
be
thought
of
the
first
congress
had
met
at
new
york
but
it
only
remained
there
a
short
time
then
the
seat
of
government
was
moved
to
philadelphia
philadelphia
however
was
not
considered
a
good
place
so
it
was
decided
to
build
a
new
capital
the
northern
states
wanted
it
in
the
north
the
southern
states
wanted
it
in
the
south
but
finally
it
was
agreed
upon
to
have
it
on
the
potomac
river
almost
in
the
middle
virginia
and
maryland
offering
the
territory
splendid
plans
were
made
and
the
building
was
begun
but
for
the
next
ten
years
philadelphia
still
remained
the
seat
of
government
so
four
busy
years
went
past
and
the
time
of
washington
presidency
drew
to
an
end
he
rejoiced
to
think
that
after
his
hard
work
for
his
country
he
could
now
go
back
to
his
peaceful
home
at
mount
vernon
and
be
at
rest
but
his
friends
would
not
let
him
go
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
not
yet
firmly
on
its
feet
only
he
could
make
it
firm
they
said
the
people
loved
him
and
would
be
guided
by
him
when
they
would
not
follow
any
one
else
therefore
he
must
stay
at
length
washington
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
and
allowed
himself
to
be
elected
president
a
second
time
and
now
there
arose
difficulties
between
the
united
states
and
their
old
friends
the
french
for
while
the
americans
had
been
hammering
away
at
their
constitution
and
making
a
new
nation
out
of
raw
material
the
french
had
risen
against
the
tyranny
of
their
king
and
had
declared
france
a
republic
and
when
many
of
the
european
countries
joined
together
to
fight
france
and
force
them
to
take
back
their
king
the
french
people
looked
to
the
sister
republic
across
the
atlantic
for
help
they
had
helped
the
americans
in
their
struggle
surely
now
the
americans
would
help
them
but
the
french
went
too
far
they
seemed
to
lose
all
sense
of
right
and
wrong
they
put
hundreds
of
people
to
death
without
cause
and
drowned
france
in
blood
so
many
people
who
had
wished
them
well
at
the
beginning
turned
from
them
and
although
many
people
in
america
were
ready
to
fight
for
the
french
washington
determined
to
keep
peace
he
was
not
ungrateful
to
the
french
for
their
help
in
the
american
revolution
but
he
felt
that
their
wild
orgy
of
blood
was
wrong
and
he
saw
too
that
america
was
too
young
a
nation
to
plunge
again
into
war
so
he
proclaimed
the
united
states
to
be
neutral
that
is
that
they
would
take
part
on
neither
side
in
the
european
war
when
the
french
heard
that
america
refused
to
help
them
they
were
greatly
hurt
but
worse
was
yet
to
follow
for
washington
besides
refusing
to
fight
for
the
french
made
a
treaty
with
the
british
with
whom
the
french
were
at
war
the
war
of
independence
had
left
some
bitterness
between
the
old
country
and
the
new
and
as
time
went
on
that
bitterness
increased
rather
than
lessened
the
united
states
felt
that
britain
hardly
treated
them
with
the
respect
due
to
an
independent
nation
and
indeed
some
of
britain
actions
were
fairly
high
handed
during
the
war
a
great
many
negroes
had
been
carried
off
into
canada
and
britain
would
not
pay
for
them
the
boundaries
between
the
united
states
and
canada
were
still
in
dispute
britain
made
no
effort
to
settle
them
but
kept
possession
of
such
forts
as
oswego
detroit
niagara
and
others
then
because
they
were
at
war
with
france
the
british
interfered
with
and
almost
ruined
american
trade
with
the
french
west
indies
and
lastly
what
seemed
to
americans
the
worst
insult
of
all
they
claimed
the
right
of
search
that
is
they
claimed
the
right
of
searching
neutral
vessels
for
british
seamen
and
of
taking
them
by
force
to
serve
in
the
british
navy
in
those
early
days
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
an
englishmen
from
an
american
by
his
speech
and
thus
americans
were
often
seized
and
made
to
serve
in
the
british
navy
there
were
other
grievances
but
these
were
chief
taken
altogether
they
made
the
americans
so
angry
that
washington
feared
another
war
for
which
he
knew
the
nation
was
not
ready
he
decided
therefore
to
make
a
bid
for
peace
and
sent
john
jay
to
london
to
arrange
matters
between
the
two
countries
jay
did
not
find
british
statesmen
in
any
yielding
mood
and
so
the
treaty
which
he
arranged
and
which
goes
by
his
name
was
not
altogether
favourable
to
the
americans
there
was
for
instance
nothing
in
the
treaty
about
paying
for
the
slaves
nor
about
the
right
of
search
but
seeing
that
he
could
get
no
better
terms
jay
accepted
those
offered
him
undoubtedly
america
asked
more
than
britain
could
well
give
equally
undoubtedly
britain
gave
less
than
america
had
a
right
to
expect
washington
was
not
satisfied
with
the
treaty
but
he
felt
that
jay
had
done
his
best
he
felt
too
that
it
was
either
the
treaty
or
war
so
rather
than
have
war
he
signed
it
when
however
the
terms
of
it
became
known
a
cry
of
rage
rang
through
the
country
those
who
had
supported
it
were
hooted
at
and
stoned
in
the
streets
john
jay
was
burned
in
effigy
the
treaty
itself
was
publicly
burned
even
washington
beloved
as
he
was
did
not
escape
taunts
and
insults
were
flung
at
him
he
was
called
a
tyrant
and
a
traitor
but
in
spite
of
all
the
opposition
washington
stood
firm
he
held
to
the
treaty
and
peace
with
the
old
country
was
kept
the
storm
was
bitter
while
it
lasted
but
at
length
it
died
down
and
the
men
who
had
flung
insults
at
washington
saw
in
time
that
he
had
been
right
he
had
kept
peace
and
as
a
young
nation
america
stood
in
need
of
peace
more
than
anything
else
washington
second
term
of
office
now
came
to
an
end
he
was
utterly
weary
of
public
life
and
he
resolutely
refused
to
stand
for
president
again
it
was
nearly
forty
years
now
since
he
had
first
begun
to
work
for
his
country
he
felt
that
his
work
was
done
and
all
he
wanted
now
was
to
spend
his
last
days
quietly
in
his
beloved
home
mount
vernon
this
time
washington
had
his
way
and
laid
down
his
office
then
as
second
president
the
people
chose
john
adams
who
had
already
been
chapter
adams
how
he
kept
peace
with
france
the
crowd
which
gathered
to
see
john
adams
take
the
oath
was
almost
as
great
as
that
which
had
gathered
when
washington
had
first
been
made
president
but
it
was
upon
the
old
and
not
upon
the
new
president
that
all
eyes
were
turned
and
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
people
seemed
still
loath
to
part
from
their
beloved
president
and
a
great
crowd
followed
him
in
silence
to
his
home
at
the
door
before
entering
he
turned
and
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
he
signed
a
last
farewell
to
his
people
so
for
a
long
silent
moment
he
stood
upon
the
doorstep
then
he
entered
the
house
and
as
the
door
closed
upon
him
a
great
sob
broke
from
the
crowd
thus
the
people
took
a
last
farewell
of
their
great
and
beloved
leader
almost
as
soon
as
john
adams
became
president
in
he
found
himself
plunged
into
trouble
with
france
for
the
jay
treaty
had
made
the
french
people
very
angry
they
refused
to
receive
charles
pinckney
who
was
sent
as
ambassador
and
he
had
to
flee
to
holland
for
refuge
the
americans
were
very
angry
at
this
treatment
of
their
minister
and
talked
of
war
but
adams
was
anxious
to
keep
peace
so
he
sent
two
more
ambassadors
to
france
and
with
them
pinckney
returned
also
but
the
french
received
the
three
ambassadors
with
little
more
courtesy
than
they
had
received
the
one
they
now
began
to
demand
all
sorts
of
things
from
the
united
states
they
demanded
among
other
things
that
the
americans
should
pay
them
a
large
sum
of
money
as
a
bribe
they
demanded
a
large
loan
also
if
they
refused
why
then
let
the
americans
beware
with
these
demands
and
threats
the
ambassadors
were
obliged
to
leave
france
but
they
were
not
going
to
be
bullied
so
to
the
french
threats
they
replied
by
building
ships
raising
an
army
and
buying
cannon
everywhere
too
patriotic
songs
were
written
and
sung
one
of
them
being
hail
columbia
by
joseph
hopkinson
once
more
george
washington
was
asked
to
become
in
and
with
a
heavy
heart
he
consented
he
did
not
want
to
leave
his
quiet
home
for
the
horrors
and
clamour
of
the
battlefield
still
less
did
he
want
to
fight
against
his
old
friends
but
at
his
country
call
he
rose
the
french
however
were
not
really
anxious
to
fight
the
united
states
they
merely
wanted
to
get
money
from
them
and
when
they
saw
the
spirit
of
the
nation
they
changed
their
tune
and
did
everything
they
could
to
keep
peace
between
the
two
countries
but
the
americans
were
now
so
angry
with
the
french
that
they
were
determined
to
fight
them
war
with
france
was
everywhere
the
cry
john
adams
however
like
washington
was
determined
if
possible
to
keep
peace
so
without
asking
any
one
advice
he
sent
another
friendly
mission
to
france
and
the
quarrel
was
quietly
settled
thus
peace
was
kept
but
the
people
were
angry
with
adams
they
declared
that
he
had
all
sorts
of
mean
reasons
for
his
action
he
was
sure
he
had
done
right
when
i
am
dead
he
said
write
on
my
tomb
lies
john
adams
who
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
peace
with
france
he
felt
that
he
could
have
no
better
epitaph
while
adams
was
president
in
another
state
was
added
to
the
union
this
was
tennessee
which
was
an
offshoot
from
north
carolina
for
several
years
tennessee
passed
through
troublous
times
for
a
few
years
indeed
the
state
was
set
up
as
a
separate
republic
under
the
name
of
franklin
this
name
was
given
to
it
in
honour
of
benjamin
franklin
the
great
statesman
but
some
of
the
people
wanted
it
called
frankland
or
freeland
so
it
was
known
by
both
names
the
inhabitants
of
franklin
now
chose
a
governor
instituted
a
senate
and
a
house
of
commons
and
made
laws
for
themselves
but
very
soon
this
government
collapsed
and
after
a
few
more
troublous
years
the
state
entered
the
union
under
the
name
of
tennessee
all
this
time
men
had
been
busy
building
the
new
capital
and
toward
the
end
of
the
government
was
removed
there
washington
the
great
father
of
his
country
had
just
died
and
it
was
determined
to
call
the
new
city
by
his
name
but
when
the
government
arrived
at
washington
they
found
the
city
little
more
than
a
wilderness
only
a
part
of
the
capitol
was
built
and
around
it
there
was
nothing
but
desolation
there
were
neither
streets
nor
shops
neither
business
nor
society
the
president
house
was
set
down
in
the
midst
of
an
uncultivated
field
and
beyond
that
and
the
unfinished
capitol
there
were
but
a
few
scattered
houses
and
one
hotel
many
people
were
disgusted
with
the
new
capital
and
it
was
given
all
sorts
of
names
such
as
the
capital
of
miserable
huts
the
wilderness
city
or
the
mudhole
every
now
and
again
one
or
other
of
the
members
of
congress
would
suggest
that
the
capital
should
be
removed
elsewhere
but
there
were
always
some
determined
to
stay
and
at
length
by
slow
degrees
the
city
grew
into
one
of
the
beautiful
capitals
of
the
world
chapter
jefferson
how
the
territory
of
the
united
states
was
doubled
adams
was
an
honest
and
patriotic
man
but
he
never
won
the
love
of
the
people
as
washington
had
done
and
when
in
his
term
of
office
came
to
an
end
he
went
back
to
his
country

there
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
as
a
simple
citizen
jefferson
first
president
inaugurated
in
washington
thomas
jefferson
was
the
next
president
the
first
to
be
inaugurated
in
the
new
capital
he
had
been
with
adams
and
was
already
well
known
in
politics
it
was
he
who
wrote
the
declaration
of
independence
and
he
was
in
every
way
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
of
his
time
he
was
a
lanky
sandy
coloured
man
he
wore
badly
fitting
clothes
and
hated
ceremony
of
all
kinds
he
was
quite
determined
not
to
have
any
fuss
over
his
inauguration
so
dressed
as
plainly
as
possible
he
rode
to
the
capitol
by
himself
tied
his
horse
to
the
palings
and
walked
into
the
senate
chamber
alone
just
like
any
ordinary
man
this
lack
of
ceremony
he
kept
up
throughout
all
the
time
he
was
president
indeed
he
sometimes
overdid
it
and
offended
people
once
the
british
minister
was
to
be
presented
to
him
and
went
dressed
in
his
grandest
uniform
but
to
his
disgust
he
found
jefferson
in
the
very
shabbiest
of
clothes
and
slippers
down
at
the
heel
so
the
good
gentleman
went
away
feeling
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
meant
to
insult
not
merely
himself
but
the
king
he
represented
it
was
while
jefferson
was
president
in
that
ohio
joined
the
union
as
the
seventeenth
state
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
a
few
squatters
on
the
land
but
it
was
only
after
the
revolution
that
it
really
began
to
be
inhabited
by
white
men
in
about
fifty
men
led
by
rufus
putnam
the
father
of
ohio
settled
there
they
founded
a
town
and
called
it
marietta
in
honour
of
maria
antoinette
the
french
queen
others
followed
and
soon
villages
were
sprinkled
all
along
the
north
bank
of
the
ohio
river
then
some
years
later
moses
cleaveland
founded
the
town
of
cleveland
on
the
shores
of
lake
erie
but
all
along
the
banks
of
the
ohio
indians
lived
and
they
would
not
let
the
white
men
settle
on
their
land
without
protest
so
the
new
settlers
were
constantly
harassed
and
in
danger
of
their
lives
and
many
murders
were
committed
at
length
it
was
decided
that
this
must
cease
and
as
the
indians
would
listen
to
no
argument
general
clair
with
an
army
of
eighteen
hundred
men
marched
against
them
he
did
not
know
the
country
and
he
had
no
guide
late
one
evening
in
november
he
encamped
in
the
woods
at
dawn
the
next
day
he
was
awakened
by
the
cry
of
the
indians
the
men
sprang
to
arms
but
in
the
night
the
indians
had
completely
surrounded
them
and
the
fight
was
hopeless
for
four
hours
the
slaughter
lasted
then
the
white
men
fled
leaving
half
their
number
dead
upon
the
field
it
was
one
of
the
worst
defeats
white
men
ever
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
indians
the
whole
countryside
was
filled
with
the
horror
and
the
redmen
exulted
in
their
victory
the
president
tried
to
reason
with
them
but
they
would
not
listen
the
only
thing
that
would
satisfy
them
was
that
the
white
men
should
withdraw
beyond
the
ohio
this
the
white
men
refused
to
do
and
they
sent
another
large
force
against
the
indians
this
time
the
force
was
under
the
command
of
general
wayne
in
a
great
battle
he
utterly
defeated
the
indians
afterwards
he
held
a
grand
council
with
them
and
they
knowing
themselves
defeated
swore
peace
forevermore
with
the
white
men
and
acknowledged
their
right
to
the
land
beyond
the
ohio
this
was
the
first
great
council
that
the
indians
had
ever
held
with
the
thirteen
fires
of
the
united
states
they
kept
their
treaty
faithfully
and
not
one
of
the
chiefs
who
swore
peace
to
general
wayne
ever
again
lifted
the
war
hatchet
against
the
and
now
that
peace
with
the
indians
was
secure
many
settlers
flocked
into
the
country
and
in
ohio
was
received
into
the
union
as
the
seventeenth
state
but
the
most
interesting
and
important
thing
which
happened
during
jefferson
time
of
office
was
the
louisiana
purchase
in
by
this
a
vast
territory
was
added
to
the
united
states
you
remember
that
at
the
peace
of
paris
after
the
british
had
conquered
canada
the
french
gave
up
to
spain
all
their
claims
to
the
great
tract
of
land
beyond
the
mississippi
called
louisiana
when
france
gave
up
that
vast
territory
to
spain
she
was
weak
but
now
again
she
was
strong
far
stronger
than
spain
for
the
great
soldier
napoleon
bonaparte
had
risen
to
power
he
now
looked
with
longing
eyes
on
the
lost
province
of
louisiana
and
by
a
secret
treaty
he
forced
the
king
of
spain
to
give
back
louisiana
to
france
as
soon
as
this
treaty
was
made
known
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
united
states
for
if
france
planted
colonies
all
along
the
mississippi
the
americans
would
be
shut
out
from
the
west
they
might
even
be
shut
off
from
the
mississippi
and
unable
to
use
it
for
trade
and
to
the
states
bordering
upon
it
this
would
have
been
a
great
misfortune
for
in
days
when
there
were
few
roads
and
no
railways
the
mississippi
was
the
only
trade
route
for
the
western
states
having
weighed
these
matters
seriously
jefferson
determined
if
possible
to
buy
new
orleans
from
the
french
and
thus
make
sure
of
a
passage
up
and
down
the
great
river
and
he
sent
james
monroe
to
paris
to
arrange
this
a
few
months
earlier
nothing
would
have
induced
napoleon
to
sell
any
part
of
louisiana
for
he
dreamed
of
again
founding
a
new
france
across
the
atlantic
but
now
war
threatened
with
britain
he
did
not
love
the
united
states
but
he
hated
britain
he
would
rather
he
thought
crush
britain
than
found
a
new
france
to
crush
britain
however
he
must
have
money
and
the
great
idea
came
to
him
that
he
could
make
money
out
of
louisiana
by
selling
it
to
the
americans
so
he
offered
it
to
them
for
twenty
million
dollars
the
americans
however
would
not
pay
so
much
and
at
length
after
some
bargaining
the
price
of
fifteen
million
dollars
was
agreed
upon
and
the
whole
of
louisiana
passed
to
the
american
government
and
the
territory
of
the
united
states
was
made
larger
by
more
than
a
million
square
miles
we
may
live
long
said
livingston
who
with
monroe
had
carried
the
business
through
we
may
live
long
but
this
is
the
noblest
work
of
our
lives
it
will
change
vast
solitudes
into
smiling
country
three
greatest
events
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
after
the
revolution
and
the
great
civil
war
which
was
to
come
later
the
louisiana
purchase
is
the
greatest
event
in
american
history
as
to
napoleon
he
was
well
pleased
with
his
bargain
for
besides
getting
money
to
help
him
in
his
wars
he
believed
that
he
had
made
the
united
states
powerful
enough
to
fight
and
conquer
britain
and
as
he
hated
britain
the
idea
pleased
him
this
increase
of
territory
he
said
assures
the
power
of
the
united
states
for
all
time
and
i
have
given
england
a
rival
which
sooner
or
later
will
abase
her
pride
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
napoleon
had
really
no
right
to
sell
louisiana
for
in
his
treaty
with
spain
he
had
promised
not
to
yield
it
to
any
foreign
government
and
when
the
spaniards
knew
what
he
had
done
they
were
very
angry
but
napoleon
did
not
care
he
did
as
he
liked
the
flag
of
spain
had
been
hauled
down
and
the
flag
of
france
run
up
with
great
ceremony
but
not
for
long
did
the
french
flag
float
over
new
orleans
in
less
than
three
weeks
it
was
hauled
down
and
with
firing
of
cannon
and
ringing
of
bells
the
stars
and
stripes
was
hoisted
chapter
jefferson
how
the
door
into
the
far
west
was
opened
very
little
was
known
of
this
vast
territory
which
was
thus
added
to
the
united
states
for
the
most
part
it
was
pathless
wilderness
where
no
white
man
had
ever
set
foot
long
before
the
louisiana
purchase
jefferson
had
wanted
to
send
out
an
exploring
party
into
this
unknown
west
now
he
was
more
anxious
for
it
than
ever
and
at
length
he
succeeded
in
getting
an
expedition
sent
out
the
leaders
of
this
expedition
were
two
young
officers
captain
merriwether
lewis
and
william
clark
from
their
names
the
expedition
is
usually
known
as
the
lewis
and
clark
expedition
they
made
very
careful
preparations
and
in
they
set
out
with
about
men
to
explore
the
river
missouri
some
years
before
this
a
united
states
captain
robert
grey
had
discovered
a
great
river
in
the
west
coast
of
america
and
called
it
the
columbia
after
the
name
of
his
ship
and
now
what
lewis
and
clark
had
set
out
to
do
was
to
reach
that
river
from
the
east
it
is
impossible
to
tell
here
of
all
their
thrilling
adventures
for
they
would
fill
a
whole
book
i
can
only
give
you
the
merest
outline
but
some
day
you
will
no
doubt
read
the
whole
story
as
lewis
and
clark
tell
it
themselves
the
expedition
started
from
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
and
at
first
the
explorers
passed
by
the
scattered
farms
and
little
villages
where
white
men
lived
but
these
were
the
farthest
outposts
of
civilisation
soon
they
were
left
behind
and
the
little
band
of
white
men
were
in
a
land
inhabited
only
by
redskins
the
current
was
so
swift
and
the
wind
so
often
in
the
wrong
direction
that
sails
were
almost
useless
and
the
boats
were
rowed
punted
and
towed
upstream
with
a
great
deal
of
hard
labour
some
of
the
travelers
went
in
the
boats
others
rode
or
walked
along
the
bank
these
last
did
the
hunting
and
kept
the
expedition
supplied
with
meat
one
of
the
leaders
always
went
with
those
on
shore
for
it
was
often
difficult
for
the
two
parties
to
keep
together
sometimes
the
river
wound
about
and
those
on
land
could
take
a
short
cut
while
at
other
times
those
on
land
had
to
make
a
wide
circuit
to
avoid
marshes
or
steep
precipices
the
river
was
full
of
fish
and
the
land
swarmed
with
game
antelopes
deer
black
bear
turkeys
geese
ducks
in
fact
all
sorts
of
birds
and
beasts
were
abundant
there
were
also
great
quantities
of
delicious
wild
grapes
as
well
as
plums
currants
and
other
fruits
so
the
travelers
had
no
lack
of
food
they
met
many
tribes
of
indians
and
they
nearly
all
seemed
friendly
for
both
lewis
and
clark
knew
well
how
to
treat
indians
when
they
came
into
their
land
they
called
the
chiefs
together
to
a
council
and
made
them
a
speech
telling
them
that
the
land
was
no
longer
spanish
but
american
the
indians
would
pretend
to
be
pleased
at
the
change
but
really
they
understood
nothing
about
it
but
they
liked
the
medals
and
other
trinkets
which
the
white
men
gave
them
and
most
of
them
were
very
anxious
to
have
some
of
the
great
father
milk
by
which
they
meant
whiskey
but
one
tribe
refused
it
we
marvel
they
said
that
our
brothers
should
give
us
drink
which
will
make
us
fools
no
man
can
be
our
friend
who
would
lead
us
into
such
folly
until
the
end
of
october
the
expedition
kept
on
always
following
the
course
of
the
missouri
but
the
weather
now
became
very
cold
ice
began
to
form
on
the
river
and
the
explorers
determined
to
camp
for
the
winter
not
far
from
what
is
now
the
town
of
bismarck
north
dakota
they
built
themselves
a
little
village
of
log
huts
and
called
it
fort
mandan
for
the
country
belonged
to
the
mandan
indians
here
they
met
both
french
and
british
fur
traders
who
in
spite
of
the
bitter
weather
came
from
assiniboia
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
north
to
trade
for
furs
with
the
indians
the
weather
was
bitterly
cold
but
the
men
were
fairly
comfortable
in
their
log
huts
and
they
had
plenty
to
do
they
went
upon
hunting
expeditions
to
get
food
they
built
boats
and
they
set
up
a
forge
this
last
greatly
interested
the
indians
who
brought
their
axes
and
kettles
to
be
mended
and
in
return
gave
the
white
men
grain
soon
the
smith
was
the
busiest
man
in
the
whole
company
the
bellows
particularly
interesting
the
redmen
indeed
everything
about
the
white
strangers
was
so
interesting
to
the
indians
that
they
were
nearly
always
in
their
huts
on
christmas
day
the
travelers
only
got
rid
of
their
inquisitive
visitors
by
telling
them
that
it
was
a
great
medicine
day
with
the
white
people
when
no
strangers
were
allowed
near
them
and
they
must
keep
away
the
travelers
stayed
at
fort
mandan
till
the
beginning
of
april
then
the
ice
being
melted
on
the
river
they
set
out
again
game
now
became
more
than
ever
plentiful
and
they
had
several
encounters
with
huge
grizzly
bears
the
indians
had
told
the
explorers
terrible
stories
about
these
bears
they
themselves
had
such
great
respect
for
them
that
they
never
went
out
to
hunt
them
without
putting
on
their
war
paint
and
making
as
great
preparations
as
if
they
were
going
to
fight
some
enemy
tribe
the
white
men
too
soon
came
to
have
a
great
respect
for
them
i
find
wrote
lewis
in
his
journal
that
the
curiosity
of
our
party
is
pretty
well
satisfied
with
respect
to
this
animal
he
has
staggered
the
resolution
of
several
of
them
later
on
he
added
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
like
the
gentlemen
and
had
rather
fight
two
indians
than
one
bear
one
day
lewis
was
on
shore
and
seeing
a
herd
of
buffalo
shot
one
for
supper
after
it
fell
he
stood
looking
at
it
and
forgot
to
load
his
rifle
again
while
standing
thus
he
suddenly
saw
a
large
bear
creeping
towards
him
instantly
he
lifted
his
rifle
but
remembered
in
a
flash
that
it
was
not
loaded
he
had
no
time
to
load
so
he
thought
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
walk
away
as
fast
as
he
could
it
was
in
an
open
plain
with
not
a
bush
or
tree
near
and
as
lewis
retreated
the
bear
ran
at
full
speed
after
him
lewis
took
to
his
heels
and
fled
but
the
bear
ran
so
fast
that
lewis
soon
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
escape
for
the
bear
was
gaining
fast
upon
him
then
suddenly
it
flashed
across
his
mind
that
if
he
jumped
into
the
river
he
might
escape
so
turning
short
he
leaped
into
the
water
then
facing
about
he
pointed
his
halberd
at
the
bear
seeing
this
the
bear
suddenly
stopped
on
the
bank
not
twenty
feet
away
then
as
if
he
were
frightened
he
turned
tail
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
had
come
lewis
was
glad
enough
to
escape
so
easily
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
never
again
would
he
allow
his
rifle
to
be
unloaded
even
for
a
moment
other
dangers
too
beset
the
travelers
one
day
lewis
and
his
companions
were
following
the
boats
along
the
bluffs
which
rose
high
above
the
water
edge
the
ground
was
so
slippery
that
they
could
only
with
difficulty
keep
their
feet
once
lewis
slipped
and
only
saved
himself
by
means
of
the
pike
which
he
carried
from
being
hurled
into
the
river
a
hundred
feet
below
he
had
just
reached
a
spot
where
he
could
stand
fairly
safely
when
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
cry
out
good
god
captain
what
shall
i
do
he
turned
instantly
and
saw
that
one
of
his
men
who
had
lost
his
foothold
had
slipped
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
precipice
and
was
now
hanging
half
over
it
one
leg
and
arm
were
over
and
with
the
other
he
clung
frantically
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
lewis
saw
at
once
that
the
man
was
in
great
danger
of
falling
and
being
dashed
to
pieces
below
but
he
hid
his
fear
you
are
in
no
danger
he
said
in
a
calm
voice
then
he
told
the
man
to
take
his
knife
out
of
his
belt
and
dig
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
cliff
for
his
right
foot
the
man
steadied
by
his
calm
voice
did
as
he
was
told
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
able
to
drag
himself
up
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
then
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
crawled
along
till
he
was
again
in
safety
after
two
months
the
travelers
reached
the
great
falls
of
the
missouri
river
here
they
had
to
leave
the
water
and
carry
their
boats
overland
until
they
arrived
above
the
rapids
it
was
no
easy
matter
and
they
were
all
by
this
time
worn
and
weary
so
they
camped
for
a
few
days
and
made
a
rough
sort
of
cart
on
which
to
carry
the
boats
for
they
were
too
worn
out
to
carry
them
on
their
shoulders
but
the
way
was
so
rough
that
long
before
the
end
of
the
journey
the
cart
broke
down
then
began
a
most
painful
march
the
country
was
covered
with
prickly
pear
and
the
thorns
of
it
pierced
the
men
moccasins
and
wounded
their
feet
the
sun
was
so
hot
that
they
had
to
rest
every
few
minutes
and
they
were
so
tired
that
they
fell
asleep
at
every
stopping
place
yet
there
were
no
grumblers
and
in
spite
of
the
many
hardships
they
went
on
cheerfully
and
after
ten
days
hard
work
they
were
above
the
rapids
they
were
now
right
among
the
rocky
mountains
these
they
crossed
and
after
many
more
adventures
dangers
and
hardships
at
last
on
the
of
november
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
pacific
great
joy
in
the
camp
wrote
lewis
we
are
in
view
of
the
ocean
this
great
pacific
ocean
which
we
have
been
so
long
anxious
to
see
having
at
length
reached
the
columbia
river
the
travelers
sailed
down
it
to
its
mouth
and
so
reached
the
shores
of
the
pacific
and
the
end
of
their
journey
they
spent
the
winter
on
the
pacific
coast
and
towards
the
end
of
march
set
out
again
on
their
homeward
way
the
return
journey
was
almost
as
full
of
hardships
and
dangers
as
the
outward
one
had
been
but
all
were
safely
overcome
and
on
the
of
september
the
explorers
arrived
once
more
at
louis
whence
they
had
set
out
more
than
two
years
before
every
one
was
delighted
to
see
them
back
they
were
also
surprised
for
the
whole
expedition
had
long
ago
been
given
up
as
lost
but
far
from
being
lost
every
man
of
them
returned
except
one
who
had
died
not
long
after
they
had
left
louis
since
they
set
out
these
bold
adventurers
had
marched
nine
thousand
miles
over
barren
deserts
across
mountains
through
wildernesses
yet
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
any
white
man
they
had
passed
among
savage
and
unknown
tribes
and
kept
peace
with
them
they
had
braved
a
thousand
dangers
and
had
returned
triumphant
over
them
all
the
great
journey
from
sea
to
sea
had
been
accomplished
and
the
door
into
the
far
west
opened
other
travelers
and
explorers
trod
fast
upon
the
heels
of
lewis
and
clark
hunters
and
and
settlers
followed
them
and
bit
by
bit
the
west
became
known
and
peopled
but
in
the
story
of
that
growth
the
names
of
merriwether
lewis
and
william
clark
will
always
be
first
for
it
was
they
who
threw
open
the
door
into
the
far
west
chapter
jefferson
about
an
american
who
wanted
to
be
a
king
when
jefferson
had
been
chosen
president
another
man
named
aron
burr
had
run
him
very
close
and
when
the
final
choice
fell
on
jefferson
aron
burr
became
he
was
much
disappointed
at
not
becoming
president
and
a
few
years
later
he
tried
to
be
elected
governor
of
new
york
but
again
someone
else
was
chosen
and
burr
was
again
very
much
disappointed
and
he
began
to
blame
alexander
hamilton
who
for
many
years
had
been
his
constant
rival
for
all
his
failure
so
he
challenged
hamilton
to
fight
a
duel
in
those
days
duels
were
still
common
for
people
had
not
come
to
see
that
they
were
both
wicked
and
foolish
hamilton
did
not
want
to
fight
but
he
knew
people
would
call
him
coward
if
he
did
not
he
was
not
brave
enough
to
stand
that
so
he
fought
early
one
july
morning
in
the
two
men
met
burr
took
steady
aim
and
fired
hamilton
firing
wildly
into
the
air
fell
forward
dying
hamilton
had
been
selfish
and
autocratic
and
many
people
disliked
him
now
when
they
heard
of
his
death
they
forgot
that
they
only
remembered
how
much
the
nation
owed
to
the
man
who
had
put
their
money
matters
right
the
whole
country
rose
in
anger
against
burr
and
called
him
a
murderer
seeing
the
outcry
against
him
becoming
so
great
burr
fled
to
philadelphia
but
even
there
people
looked
at
him
askance
so
he
decided
to
go
for
a
tour
in
the
west
his
travels
took
him
to
marietta
ohio
the
little
town
which
had
been
founded
by
rufus
putnam
then
to
cincinnati
and
louisville
and
so
southward
till
he
reached
new
orleans
there
he
began
to
have
secret
meetings
with
all
the
chief
men
for
burr
was
now
full
of
a
great
idea
he
had
failed
to
get
into
power
in
the
united
states
and
his
failure
had
made
him
bitter
he
had
killed
the
man
who
he
thought
was
his
greatest
enemy
and
that
instead
of
helping
him
had
caused
the
people
to
cast
him
out
altogether
now
he
determined
to
own
an
empire
for
himself
and
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
united
states
he
had
in
fact
made
up
his
mind
to
divide
the
west
from
the
east
and
make
himself
emperor
of
the
west
under
the
title
of
aron
i
the
empire
was
to
be
kept
in
the
family
and
his
beautiful
daughter
theodosia
was
to
be
queen
after
him
but
it
was
gravely
debated
whether
her
husband
could
take
the
title
of
king
or
not
the
mad
scheme
grew
daily
burr
plan
was
suddenly
to
seize
both
president
and
then
having
the
heads
of
government
in
his
power
he
would
next
lay
hands
on
the
public
money
and
the
navy
he
would
take
what
ships
he
wanted
burn
the
rest
and
sailing
to
new
orleans
he
would
proclaim
his
empire
but
burr
dare
not
let
every
one
know
his
real
intentions
and
so
he
gave
out
that
he
meant
to
lead
an
expedition
against
mexico
as
time
went
on
hundreds
of
people
knew
of
his
conspiracy
it
was
talked
of
everywhere
but
jefferson
paid
no
heed
he
did
not
believe
that
burr
meant
any
treason
against
the
union
so
the
conspirators
went
on
building
boats
and
arming
men
undisturbed
but
things
did
not
go
so
smoothly
as
burr
had
hoped
he
had
expected
to
get
help
from
britain
and
he
got
none
he
had
expected
help
from
spain
and
he
got
none
still
he
went
on
with
his
scheming
he
had
even
written
out
his
declaration
of
independence
it
was
said
when
suddenly
the
end
came
one
of
burr
friends
betrayed
him
and
at
length
president
jefferson
woke
up
to
what
was
going
on
at
once
he
issued
a
proclamation
declaring
that
a
conspiracy
against
spain
was
being
carried
on
and
commanding
all
officers
of
the
united
states
to
seize
the
persons
engaged
in
the
plot
no
name
was
mentioned
in
the
proclamation
but
burr
knew
his
plot
was
discovered
once
more
he
had
failed
and
he
fled
he
changed
clothes
with
a
boatman
on
the
mississippi
and
vanished
into
the
forest
for
a
month
no
one
knew
where
he
was
for
beneath
the
battered
white
felt
and
homespun
clothes
of
a
river
boatman
no
one
recognised
the
dapper
politician
meanwhile
burr
was
slowly
making
his
way
east
hoping
to
reach
the
coast
and
get
away
in
some
ship
he
had
still
many
friends
and
one
night
he
stopped
at
a
cottage
to
ask
his
way
to
the
house
of
one
of
these
friends
in
the
cottage
were
two
young
men
one
of
them
named
perkins
looked
keenly
at
the
stranger
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
face
and
clothes
were
not
in
keeping
and
his
boots
looked
to
smart
for
the
rest
of
his
get
up
after
the
stranger
had
gone
he
still
thought
about
it
then
suddenly
he
said
that
was
aron
burr
let
us
go
after
him
and
arrest
him
the
other
man
however
laughed
at
him
and
refused
to
stir
so
perkins
went
off
alone
to
find
the
sheriff
and
soon
the
two
were
riding
posthaste
after
the
stranger
when
they
reached
the
house
to
which
burr
had
asked
the
way
perkins
stayed
outside
with
the
horses
and
the
sheriff
went
into
the
house
he
was
going
to
arrest
a
bold
bad
man
and
it
would
be
a
great
feather
in
his
cap
so
in
he
marched
feeling
very
firm
and
grand
expecting
to
find
a
terrible
ruffian
of
a
fellow
but
instead
of
a
terrible
ruffian
the
sheriff
found
a
pleasant
delightful
gentleman
and
a
brilliant
talker
so
the
poor
sheriff
heart
failed
him
he
really
could
not
arrest
this
charming
gentleman
and
instead
he
stayed
to
hear
him
talk
meanwhile
out
in
the
cold
perkins
waited
with
the
horses
and
as
the
hours
went
past
and
the
sheriff
did
not
return
he
guessed
what
had
happened
but
he
was
not
going
to
be
done
out
of
his
capture
so
he
went
off
to
the
captain
of
the
fort
and
told
him
of
his
discovery
the
captain
was
not
so
easily
charmed
as
the
sheriff
and
before
the
next
evening
burr
found
himself
a
prisoner
in
the
fort
there
he
remained
for
about
three
weeks
then
he
was
sent
to
richmond
virginia
to
be
tried
it
was
a
journey
of
about
a
thousand
miles
and
in
those
days
there
were
of
course
no
railways
and
even
few
roads
a
great
part
of
the
way
led
through
pathless
forest
and
wilderness
and
the
whole
journey
had
to
be
done
on
horseback
but
perkins
undertook
to
see
the
thing
through
and
with
a
guard
of
nine
men
they
set
off
it
was
a
toilsome
march
they
had
to
carry
food
with
them
and
as
often
as
not
had
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
they
swam
their
horses
over
rivers
and
picked
their
way
through
swamps
while
hostile
indians
hung
about
their
track
every
day
was
the
same
but
still
day
after
day
they
pushed
on
once
burr
tried
to
escape
they
were
riding
through
a
small
town
in
south
carolina
where
he
knew
that
he
had
many
friends
so
suddenly
he
leapt
from
his
horse
crying
out
i
am
aron
burr
a
prisoner
i
claim
your
protection
but
as
quick
as
lightning
perkins
was
off
his
horse
too
and
with
a
pistol
in
either
hand
he
stood
before
burr
mount
he
said
get
up
the
two
men
glared
at
each
other
i
will
not
replied
burr
defiantly
heedless
of
the
pistols
perkins
had
no
wish
to
shed
blood
burr
was
not
a
very
big
man
for
an
instant
perkins
measured
him
with
his
eye
then
throwing
his
pistols
down
without
a
word
he
seized
his
prisoner
and
lifted
him
into
his
saddle
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
and
almost
before
the
townspeople
had
realised
what
had
happened
the
company
was
well
on
its
way
again
the
trial
was
long
and
exciting
most
people
believed
burr
guilty
of
treason
but
it
was
difficult
to
prove
so
in
the
end
he
was
set
free
the
american
people
however
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
the
law
might
say
he
was
innocent
but
nevertheless
they
felt
he
was
a
traitor
so
he
was
hunted
and
hounded
from
place
to
place
and
at
length
changing
his
name
he
slipped
on
board
a
ship
and
sailed
for
europe
but
even
there
he
found
no
peace
he
was
turned
out
of
england
and
looked
upon
with
suspicion
in
france
he
was
often
penniless
and
in
want
and
after
four
years
of
unhappy
wandering
he
returned
home
he
found
that
he
and
his
misdeeds
were
well
nigh
forgotten
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
so
taking
no
more
part
in
public
life
he
quietly
settled
down
in
new
york
under
all
the
blows
of
fortune
burr
never
bowed
his
head
for
although
every
one
else
might
think
him
a
traitor
his
beautiful
daughter
theodosia
believed
in
him
and
loved
him
he
as
passionately
loved
her
and
in
all
his
wanderings
he
carried
her
portrait
with
him
but
now
the
worst
misfortunes
of
his
life
overtook
him
for
a
few
weeks
after
he
landed
in
america
theodosia
wrote
to
tell
him
that
her
little
boy
had
died
this
was
a
great
grief
to
burr
for
he
loved
his
grandson
only
a
little
less
than
his
daughter
the
worst
was
still
to
come
however
theodosia
set
out
from
carolina
to
visit
her
father
but
the
ship
in
which
she
sailed
never
came
to
port
it
was
never
heard
of
again
and
all
on
board
were
lost
now
at
length
burr
head
was
bowed
life
held
nothing
more
for
him
and
he
cared
no
longer
to
live
but
death
passed
him
by
so
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
lived
a
lonely
forsaken
old
man
he
was
eighty
years
old
when
he
died
chapter
madison
the
shooting
star
and
the
prophet
jefferson
was
twice
chosen
president
he
might
had
he
wished
have
been
elected
a
third
time
but
like
washington
he
refused
he
refused
to
stand
and
as
those
two
great
presidents
refused
to
be
elected
a
third
time
it
has
become
a
kind
of
unwritten
law
in
the
united
states
that
no
man
shall
be
president
longer
than
eight
years
the
next
president
to
be
elected
was
james
madison
who
had
been
jefferson
secretary
and
friend
he
was
a
little
man
always
carefully
and
elegantly
dressed
he
was
kindly
natured
and
learned
and
like
jefferson
he
loved
peace
he
soon
however
found
himself
and
his
country
at
war
ever
since
the
indians
had
been
defeated
by
general
wayne
they
had
been
at
peace
but
now
they
again
became
restless
it
was
for
the
old
cause
they
saw
the
white
people
spreading
more
and
more
over
their
land
they
saw
themselves
being
driven
further
and
further
from
their
hunting
grounds
and
their
sleeping
hatred
of
the
awoke
again
and
now
a
great
chief
rose
to
power
among
the
indians
he
was
called
tecumseh
or
shooting
star
he
was
tall
straight
and
handsome
a
great
warrior
and
splendid
speaker
tecumseh
desire
was
to
unite
all
the
indians
into
one
great
nation
and
drive
the
out
of
the
land
in
this
he
was
joined
by
his
brother
tenskwatawa
or
the
open
door
he
took
this
name
because
he
said
he
was
the
open
door
through
which
all
might
learn
of
the
great
spirit
he
soon
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
very
great
medicine
man
and
prophet
and
is
generally
called
the
prophet
much
that
the
prophet
taught
to
the
people
was
good
he
told
them
that
they
ought
to
give
up
fighting
each
other
and
join
together
into
one
nation
that
they
ought
to
till
the
ground
and
sow
corn
and
above
all
that
they
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
fire
water
it
is
not
made
for
you
he
said
but
for
the
white
people
who
alone
know
how
to
use
it
it
is
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
which
the
indians
suffer
the
prophet
also
told
the
indians
that
they
had
no
right
to
sell
their
land
for
the
great
spirit
had
given
it
to
them
and
so
great
was
the
prophet
influence
that
he
was
able
to
build
a
town
where
the
indians
lived
peacefully
tilling
the
ground
and
where
no
fire
water
was
drunk
now
about
this
time
general
harrison
the
governor
of
the
territory
of
indiana
wanted
more
land
so
in
he
made
a
treaty
with
some
of
the
indians
and
persuaded
them
to
sign
away
their
lands
to
him
when
tecumseh
heard
of
it
he
was
very
angry
he
declared
that
the
treaty
was
no
treaty
and
that
no
land
could
be
given
to
the
white
people
unless
all
the
tribes
agreed
to
it
the
governor
tried
to
reason
with
tecumseh
but
it
was
of
no
avail
and
as
time
went
on
it
was
more
and
more
plain
that
the
indians
were
preparing
for
war
tecumseh
traveled
about
rousing
tribe
after
tribe
let
the
white
race
perish
he
cried
they
seize
our
land
they
trample
on
our
dead
back
whence
they
came
upon
a
trail
of
blood
they
must
be
driven
back
back
into
the
great
water
whose
accursed
waves
brought
them
to
our
shores
burn
their
dwellings
destroy
their
stock
slay
their
wives
and
children
to
the
redman
belongs
the
country
and
the
must
never
enjoy
it
war
now
war
for
ever
war
upon
the
living
war
upon
the
dead
dig
their
very
corpses
from
their
graves
our
country
must
give
no
rest
to
a
white
man
bones
all
the
tribes
of
the
north
are
dancing
in
the
war
dance
after
speeches
like
these
there
could
be
little
doubt
left
that
tecumseh
meant
to
begin
a
great
war
as
soon
as
he
was
ready
and
as
time
went
on
the
settlers
began
to
be
more
and
more
anxious
for
murders
became
frequent
horses
and
cattle
were
stolen
and
there
seemed
no
safety
anywhere
the
governor
sent
messages
to
the
various
tribes
saying
that
these
murders
and
thefts
must
cease
and
telling
them
that
if
they
raised
the
tomahawk
against
their
white
fathers
they
need
expect
no
mercy
the
prophet
sent
back
a
message
of
peace
but
the
outrages
still
went
on
and
through
friendly
indians
the
governor
learned
that
the
prophet
was
constantly
urging
the
indians
to
war
so
the
governor
determined
to
give
him
war
and
with
nearly
a
thousand
men
he
marched
to
tippecanoe
the
prophet
village
tecumseh
was
not
there
at
the
time
but
as
the
governor
drew
near
the
prophet
sent
him
a
message
saying
that
they
meant
nothing
but
peace
and
asking
for
a
council
next
day
to
this
general
harrison
agreed
but
well
knowing
the
treachery
of
the
indians
he
would
not
allow
his
men
to
disarm
and
they
slept
that
night
fully
dressed
and
with
their
arms
beside
them
ready
for
an
attack
the
governor
fears
were
well
founded
for
the
day
had
not
yet
dawned
when
suddenly
a
shot
was
heard
and
a
frightful
indian
yell
broke
the
stillness
in
a
minute
every
man
was
on
his
feet
and
none
too
soon
for
the
indians
were
upon
them
there
was
a
desperate
fight
in
the
grey
light
of
dawn
the
indians
fought
more
fiercely
than
ever
before
and
while
the
battle
raged
the
prophet
stood
on
a
hill
near
chanting
a
war
song
and
urging
his
men
on
every
now
and
again
messengers
came
to
him
with
news
of
the
battle
and
when
he
was
told
that
his
braves
were
falling
fast
before
the
guns
of
the
white
men
he
bade
them
still
fight
on
the
great
spirit
will
give
us
victory
he
said
the
will
flee
but
the
did
not
flee
and
when
daylight
came
they
charged
the
indians
and
scattered
them
in
flight
they
fled
to
the
forest
leaving
the
town
deserted
so
the
americans
burned
it
and
marched
away
when
tecumseh
heard
of
this
battle
he
was
so
angry
that
he
seized
his
brother
by
the
hair
of
his
head
and
shook
him
till
his
teeth
rattled
for
the
prophet
had
begun
to
fight
before
his
plans
were
complete
and
instead
of
being
victorious
had
been
defeated
and
tecumseh
felt
that
now
he
would
never
be
able
to
unite
all
the
tribes
into
one
great
nation
as
he
had
dreamed
of
doing
the
braves
too
were
angry
with
the
prophet
because
he
had
not
led
them
to
victory
as
he
had
sworn
to
do
they
ceased
to
believe
in
him
and
after
the
battle
of
tippecanoe
the
prophet
lost
his
power
over
the
indians
chapter
madison
war
with
great
britain
the
berlin
decree
and
the
orders
in
meanwhile
in
europe
a
terrible
war
between
france
and
britain
was
raging
and
the
effects
of
this
war
were
being
felt
in
america
for
in
order
to
crush
britain
napoleon
declared
that
the
british
isles
were
in
a
state
of
blockade
and
forbade
any
country
to
trade
with
great
britain
in
reply
the
british
declared
france
to
be
in
a
state
of
blockade
and
forbade
any
country
to
trade
with
france
these
decrees
and
others
of
the
same
sort
hit
american
trade
very
hard
and
under
them
the
american
people
began
to
be
restive
then
added
to
this
the
british
still
claimed
the
right
to
search
american
vessels
for
deserters
from
the
british
navy
and
very
often
american
citizens
were
carried
off
and
made
to
serve
in
the
british
navy
this
right
of
search
perhaps
annoyed
the
americans
even
more
than
the
berlin
decree
or
the
orders
in
council
as
the
french
and
british
decrees
were
called
and
at
length
many
of
them
became
eager
for
war
napoleon
was
doing
even
worse
things
than
the
british
but
in
spite
of
a
good
deal
of
friction
france
was
still
looked
upon
as
a
friend
while
the
bitterness
against
britain
had
not
yet
been
forgotten
then
too
it
was
easier
to
fight
britain
than
france
for
to
fight
france
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
send
an
army
across
the
sea
while
to
fight
britain
it
was
only
necessary
to
march
into
canada
a
good
many
of
the
americans
were
rather
pleased
with
that
idea
hoping
that
they
might
conquer
canada
and
add
it
to
the
states
but
madison
hated
war
and
loved
peace
almost
as
much
as
jefferson
who
had
said
our
passion
is
for
peace
but
many
of
the
older
men
who
had
helped
to
found
the
republic
and
laboured
to
keep
it
at
peace
had
now
gone
in
their
place
there
had
risen
some
eager
young
men
who
earned
for
themselves
the
name
of
war
democrats
they
overpersuaded
madison
and
on
june
war
with
great
britain
was
declared
as
soon
as
war
was
declared
tecumseh
with
all
the
braves
he
could
command
immediately
went
over
to
the
british
side
the
british
at
this
time
had
a
very
clever
general
named
brock
and
for
some
time
things
went
ill
for
the
americans
on
land
but
on
the
sea
they
had
much
better
success
the
first
great
fight
was
between
the
american
ship
constitution
and
the
british
ship
guerriere
the
guerriere
was
a
good
deal
smaller
than
the
constitution
but
the
british
captain
was
so
certain
that
any
british
ship
no
matter
how
small
could
beat
any
american
one
no
matter
how
large
that
he
cared
nothing
for
that
it
was
afternoon
when
the
two
ships
came
in
sight
of
each
other
and
immediately
prepared
for
a
fight
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
to
each
other
but
not
until
they
were
scarce
fifty
yards
apart
did
the
constitution
open
fire
then
it
was
deadly
the
mizzen
mast
of
the
guerriere
was
shot
away
very
soon
the
main
mast
followed
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
guerriere
was
a
hopeless
wreck
then
the
british
captain
struck
his
flag
and
surrendered
the
constitution
was
scarcely
hurt
and
after
this
she
got
the
name
of
old
ironsides
she
sailed
the
seas
for
many
a
long
day
and
is
now
kept
as
a
national
memorial
in
the
navy
yard
at
portsmouth
mass
the
loss
of
one
ship
was
as
nothing
to
the
great
sea
power
of
britain
but
it
cheered
the
americans
greatly
and
it
was
the
beginning
of
many
like
successes
so
this
way
and
that
both
on
land
and
sea
fortune
swayed
now
one
side
winning
now
the
other
at
the
battle
of
queenstown
a
city
in
canada
on
the
niagara
river
the
british
won
the
victory
but
lost
their
great
leader
brock
so
that
victory
was
too
dearly
bought
yet
still
the
british
continued
to
win
and
after
one
battle
the
indians
began
to
torture
and
slay
the
american
prisoners
the
british
general
did
not
know
how
to
curb
the
fiery
redmen
and
he
let
the
horrid
massacre
go
on
but
when
tecumseh
heard
of
it
he
was
filled
with
wrath
and
grief
with
a
wild
shout
of
anger
he
dashed
in
among
the
indians
two
indians
who
were
about
to
kill
an
american
he
seized
by
the
throat
and
threw
to
the
ground
then
brandishing
his
tomahawk
furiously
he
swore
to
brain
any
indian
who
dared
to
touch
another
prisoner
and
such
was
the
power
that
this
chief
had
over
his
savage
followers
that
they
obeyed
him
at
once
then
tecumseh
turned
to
the
british
leader
why
did
you
permit
it
he
asked
sir
replied
general
proctor
your
indians
can
not
be
commanded
tecumseh
looked
at
him
in
utter
scorn
begone
he
said
you
are
not
fit
to
command
go
and
put
on
petticoats
things
went
so
badly
for
the
americans
that
instead
of
conquering
canada
it
seemed
almost
as
if
they
were
in
danger
of
losing
some
of
their
own
territory
for
the
british
had
the
great
peninsula
of
michigan
and
had
command
of
lake
erie
the
americans
however
determined
to
get
control
of
lake
erie
they
had
no
ships
there
but
that
did
not
daunt
them
in
the
least
there
was
plenty
of
timber
growing
in
the
forest
and
out
of
timber
ships
could
be
made
so
they
felled
trees
they
brought
sails
and
cordage
from
new
york
and
philadelphia
in
wagons
and
sledges
and
worked
so
fast
and
well
that
very
soon
ten
splendid
vessels
were
ready
meanwhile
the
british
commander
watched
the
work
and
determined
to
pounce
upon
the
ships
as
they
were
being
launched
but
just
for
one
day
he
forgot
to
be
watchful
the
americans
seized
the
opportunity
and
the
ships
sailed
out
on
to
the
lake
in
safety
the
squadron
was
under
the
command
of
a
clever
young
officer
named
oliver
hazard
perry
he
was
only
and
although
he
had
served
in
the
navy
for
fourteen
years
he
had
never
taken
part
in
a
battle
his
men
were
for
the
most
part
landsmen
unused
alike
to
war
and
ships
but
while
the
ships
were
building
perry
drilled
his
men
untiringly
so
when
the
fleet
was
launched
they
were
both
good
marksmen
and
seamen
it
was
a
bright
september
day
when
the
great
battle
took
place
between
the
british
and
american
fleets
much
of
the
british
fire
was
directed
at
the
american
named
the
lawrence
and
soon
nearly
all
her
men
were
killed
and
the
ship
seemed
about
to
sink
but
perry
was
not
beaten
wrapping
his
flag
about
his
arm
with
his
few
remaining
men
he
jumped
into
the
boats
and
rowed
to
another
ship
called
the
niagara
soon
after
this
two
of
the
british
ships
got
entangled
with
each
other
the
americans
at
once
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
and
swept
the
british
ships
from
end
to
end
with
a
terrible
fire
for
half
an
hour
longer
the
fight
went
on
then
the
british
commander
struck
his
flag
for
the
first
time
in
history
great
britain
surrendered
a
whole
squadron
and
that
to
a
young
man
of
with
little
experience
of
warfare
perry
at
once
sent
a
message
to
headquarters
to
tell
of
his
victory
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
we
have
met
the
enemy
and
they
are
ours
was
all
he
said
this
great
victory
gave
the
americans
control
of
the
lakes
and
made
many
of
the
british
victories
on
land
useless
perry
fleet
was
now
used
to
land
soldiers
in
canada
and
general
proctor
began
to
retreat
at
this
tecumseh
was
disgusted
you
always
told
us
he
said
to
the
british
leader
that
you
would
never
draw
your
foot
off
british
ground
but
now
father
we
see
that
you
are
drawing
back
and
we
are
sorry
to
see
our
father
doing
so
without
seeing
the
enemy
we
must
compare
our
father
conduct
to
a
fat
dog
that
carries
its
tail
erect
till
it
is
frightened
and
then
drops
it
between
its
legs
and
runs
away
but
general
proctor
would
not
listen
he
continued
to
run
away
at
length
however
the
americans
overtook
him
he
had
to
fight
in
battle
of
the
thames
the
british
were
defeated
and
brave
tecumseh
was
killed
it
is
not
quite
known
when
or
by
whom
he
was
killed
but
when
the
indians
saw
their
leader
was
no
longer
among
them
they
had
no
more
heart
to
fight
tecumseh
fell
and
we
all
ran
said
one
of
his
braves
afterwards
thus
the
power
of
these
indians
was
broken
for
ever
the
war
still
went
on
and
it
was
fought
not
only
in
the
north
but
all
along
the
coasts
and
in
the
south
the
americans
marched
into
toronto
the
capital
of
upper
canada
and
burned
the
parliament
house
the
british
marched
into
washington
and
burned
the
capitol
and
the
president
house
deeds
which
no
one
could
approve
even
in
the
heat
of
war
the
proper
name
for
the
president
house
is
the
executive
mansion
but
it
is
known
not
only
in
america
but
all
the
world
over
as
the
white
house
according
to
one
tradition
it
was
only
after
being
burnt
by
the
british
that
it
received
this
name
for
when
it
was
repaired
the
walls
were
painted
white
to
cover
the
marks
of
fire
according
to
another
tradition
the
people
called
it
the
white
house
from
the
beginning
in
honour
of
the
first
president
consort
martha
washington
whose
early
home
on
the
pamunkey
river
in
virginia
was
called
the
white
house
at
sea
american
privateers
did
great
damage
to
british
shipping
and
so
daring
were
they
that
even
the
irish
sea
and
the
english
channel
were
not
safe
for
british
traders
for
two
and
a
half
years
the
war
lasted
then
at
length
peace
was
made
by
the
treaty
of
ghent
it
was
signed
on
christmas
eve
and
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
there
has
been
peace
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
of
america
let
us
hope
it
will
never
be
broken
nothing
was
altered
by
this
war
no
territory
changed
hands
and
as
for
the
things
about
which
the
war
began
they
were
not
mentioned
in
the
treaty
of
peace
for
the
war
with
france
was
over
so
of
course
the
blockades
which
had
hit
american
trade
so
hard
were
no
more
in
force
on
both
sides
peace
was
hailed
with
delight
in
america
bonfires
were
lit
bells
were
rung
and
men
who
were
the
greatest
enemies
in
politics
forgot
their
quarrels
fell
into
each
other
arms
and
cried
like
women
everywhere
too
the
star
spangled
banner
was
sung
it
was
during
this
war
that
this
famous
song
was
written
the
british
were
about
to
attack
baltimore
when
francis
scott
key
hearing
that
one
of
his
friends
had
been
taken
prisoner
rowed
out
to
the
british
fleet
under
a
flag
of
truce
to
beg
his
release
the
british
admiral
consented
to
his
release
he
said
however
that
both
key
and
his
friend
must
wait
until
the
attack
was
over
so
from
the
british
fleet
key
watched
the
bombardment
of
fort
mchenry
which
guarded
the
town
all
through
the
night
the
guns
roared
and
flashed
and
in
the
lurid
light
key
could
see
the
flag
on
fort
mchenry
fluttering
proudly
but
before
dawn
the
firing
ceased
what
had
happened
he
asked
himself
was
the
fort
taken
eagerly
he
waited
for
the
dawn
and
when
at
last
the
sun
rose
he
saw
with
joy
that
the
stars
and
stripes
still
floated
over
the
fort
there
and
then
on
the
back
of
an
old
letter
he
wrote
the
star
spangled
banner
people
hailed
it
with
delight
soon
it
was
sung
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
states
and
at
length
became
the
national
anthem
during
madison
presidency
two
states
were
added
to
the
union
in
louisiana
was
added
as
the
eighteenth
state
the
state
of
louisiana
was
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
and
when
it
was
first
proposed
that
it
should
join
the
union
some
people
objected
louisiana
should
be
kept
as
a
territory
they
said
and
they
declared
that
congress
had
no
power
to
admit
new
states
except
those
which
were
formed
out
of
land
belonging
to
the
original
thirteen
states
it
was
not
for
these
men
that
our
fathers
fought
cried
a
congressman
you
have
no
authority
to
throw
the
rights
and
liberties
and
property
of
this
people
into
with
the
wild
men
on
the
missouri
or
with
the
mixed
though
more
respectable
race
of
who
bask
on
the
sands
in
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
he
declared
further
that
if
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
it
would
break
up
the
union
but
in
spite
of
him
and
others
who
thought
like
him
louisiana
became
a
state
in
in
just
about
two
years
after
the
end
of
the
war
with
britain
indiana
was
admitted
into
the
union
as
the
nineteenth
state
you
know
that
besides
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
each
state
has
also
its
own
constitution
thus
when
a
territory
wanted
to
become
a
state
it
had
to
frame
a
constitution
which
had
to
be
approved
by
congress
in
june
a
convention
to
frame
a
constitution
was
called
at
corydon
which
was
then
the
capital
of
indiana
the
weather
was
warm
and
instead
of
holding
their
meetings
in
the
state
house
the
members
used
to
meet
under
a
great
elm
which
stood
near
under
the
cool
shadow
of
its
branches
the
laws
for
the
state
were
framed
and
from
that
the
elm
was
called
the
constitution
elm
it
still
stands
as
it
stood
a
hundred
years
ago
and
the
people
of
corydon
do
everything
they
can
to
protect
it
and
make
it
live
as
long
as
possible
chapter
first
whispers
of
a
famous
doctrine
madison
was
twice
elected
president
he
was
chosen
for
the
second
time
during
the
war
with
britain
in
his
second
term
came
to
an
end
and
james
monroe
took
his
place
monroe
was
not
so
clever
as
the
presidents
who
had
gone
before
him
but
he
was
a
kindly
generous
man
every
one
liked
him
and
the
time
during
which
he
was
president
was
called
the
era
of
good
feeling
and
indeed
men
were
so
glad
of
this
time
of
peace
which
had
come
after
such
long
years
of
war
that
they
forgot
old
quarrels
and
became
friends
again
unfortunately
the
peace
was
broken
by
a
war
with
the
seminole
indians
in
florida
florida
still
belonged
to
spain
and
it
became
a
haunt
for
all
sorts
of
adventurers
these
adventurers
robbed
and
murdered
and
created
terrible
disturbances
among
the
indians
until
along
the
frontier
between
georgia
and
florida
there
was
neither
safety
nor
peace
for
any
white
man
so
the
president
at
length
sent
general
jackson
who
had
won
great
fame
in
the
war
of
to
bring
the
indians
to
order
jackson
marched
into
florida
and
in
three
months
time
had
subdued
the
indians
brought
order
out
of
wild
disorder
and
in
fact
conquered
florida
but
this
was
far
more
than
monroe
had
meant
jackson
to
do
and
it
seemed
as
if
general
jackson
was
like
to
be
in
trouble
with
the
government
and
the
government
in
trouble
with
spain
however
things
were
smoothed
over
and
the
matter
with
spain
was
put
right
by
the
united
states
buying
florida
in
and
of
this
new
territory
jackson
was
made
governor
meanwhile
more
states
were
being
added
to
the
union
after
the
war
was
over
hundreds
of
families
had
found
a
new
home
and
a
new
life
in
the
unknown
wilderness
of
the
west
indeed
so
many
people
moved
westward
that
the
people
in
the
east
began
to
grow
anxious
for
it
seemed
to
them
that
soon
the
eastern
states
would
be
left
desolate
and
they
asked
their
state
governments
to
stop
the
people
going
west
old
america
seems
to
be
breaking
up
and
moving
westward
said
one
man
all
sorts
of
stories
of
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
the
west
were
spread
abroad
but
in
spite
of
all
that
was
said
the
stream
still
poured
westward
the
people
went
in
great
covered
wagons
drawn
by
teams
of
horses
carrying
with
them
all
their
household
goods
or
they
rode
on
horseback
taking
nothing
with
them
but
a
few
clothes
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
while
some
even
trudged
the
long
hundreds
of
miles
on
foot
the
rivers
too
were
crowded
with
boats
of
all
sorts
many
people
going
part
of
the
way
by
river
and
the
rest
on
foot
in
the
east
fields
were
left
desolate
houses
and
churches
fell
to
ruins
while
in
the
west
towns
and
villages
sprang
up
as
if
by
magic
and
the
untrodden
wilderness
was
turned
to
fertile
fields
so
as
the
great
prairies
of
the
west
became
settled
the
settlers
became
eager
to
join
the
union
thus
new
states
were
formed
mississippi
became
a
state
in
the
first
year
of
presidency
illinois
followed
in
alabama
in
and
missouri
in
mississippi
illinois
and
alabama
were
framed
out
of
original
territory
but
missouri
was
framed
out
of
the
louisiana
purchase
all
four
names
are
indian
mississippi
and
missouri
are
named
after
the
rivers
which
flow
through
them
mississippi
meaning
father
of
waters
and
missouri
great
muddy
for
the
missouri
is
full
of
yellow
mud
illinois
is
named
after
the
tribe
of
indians
who
lived
there
their
name
was
really
iliniwok
meaning
men
but
white
people
pronounced
it
badly
and
it
became
changed
to
illinois
alabama
means
here
we
rest
in
maine
also
was
admitted
as
a
state
maine
however
was
not
newly
settled
country
since
colonial
days
it
had
been
a
part
of
massachusetts
but
having
become
dissatisfied
it
separated
from
massachusetts
and
asked
to
be
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
separate
state
it
was
just
about
the
same
time
that
missouri
was
also
asking
to
be
admitted
as
a
state
and
strangely
enough
the
admission
of
these
two
states
became
connected
with
each
other
we
must
look
back
a
little
to
see
how
you
remember
that
two
hundred
years
before
this
slaves
were
first
brought
to
virginia
in
those
days
no
one
thought
that
slavery
was
wrong
so
as
colony
was
added
to
colony
they
also
became
slave
owners
but
gradually
many
people
began
to
think
that
slavery
was
a
great
evil
and
every
now
and
again
one
colony
or
another
would
try
to
put
it
down
but
these
attempts
always
ended
in
failure
in
the
northern
states
however
there
were
few
slaves
for
in
these
northern
states
there
was
not
much
that
slaves
could
do
which
could
not
be
done
just
as
well
by
white
men
so
it
did
not
pay
to
keep
slaves
and
gradually
slavery
was
done
away
with
but
in
the
south
it
was
different
there
it
was
so
hot
that
white
men
could
not
do
the
work
in
the
rice
and
cotton
fields
and
the
planters
believed
that
without
negro
slave
labour
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
their
plantations
pay
then
when
the
power
of
steam
was
discovered
and
many
new
cotton
spinning
machines
were
invented
the
demand
for
cotton
became
greater
and
greater
the
southern
planters
became
more
sure
than
ever
that
slavery
was
needful
they
also
became
afraid
that
the
people
in
the
north
would
want
to
do
away
with
it
and
if
the
number
of
the
states
in
which
slavery
was
not
allowed
increased
it
would
be
easy
for
them
to
do
this
so
the
southerners
determined
that
if
states
were
admitted
to
the
union
slavery
states
must
be
admitted
also
to
keep
the
balance
even
now
when
maine
and
missouri
both
asked
to
be
admitted
as
states
the
southerners
refused
to
admit
maine
as
a
free
state
unless
missouri
was
made
a
slave
state
to
balance
it
there
was
tremendous
excitement
and
talk
over
the
matter
meetings
were
held
in
all
the
large
towns
in
the
north
the
speakers
called
slavery
the
greatest
evil
in
the
united
states
and
a
disgrace
to
the
american
people
in
the
south
the
speakers
declared
that
congress
had
no
right
to
dictate
to
a
state
as
to
whether
it
should
have
slavery
or
not
but
even
in
the
south
few
really
stood
up
for
slavery
almost
every
one
acknowledged
that
it
was
an
evil
but
it
was
a
necessary
evil
they
said
in
the
house
and
the
senate
there
were
great
debates
also
but
at
length
an
arrangement
was
come
to
missouri
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
slave
state
but
in
the
rest
of
the
louisiana
territory
north
of
the
degree
of
latitude
degrees
slavery
was
forbidden
for
all
time
this
was
called
the
missouri
compromise
compromise
meaning
as
you
know
that
each
side
gave
up
something
and
in
this
way
a
quarrel
between
the
north
and
south
was
avoided
for
the
time
being
but
it
was
only
for
the
time
being
and
wise
men
watched
events
with
heavy
hearts
among
these
was
the
old
president
jefferson
the
question
sleeps
for
the
present
he
said
but
is
not
dead
he
felt
sure
that
it
would
awake
again
and
shatter
the
union
and
he
thanked
god
that
being
an
old
man
he
might
not
live
to
see
it
in
monroe
was
chosen
president
for
a
second
time
and
it
was
during
this
second
term
that
he
became
famous
throughout
all
the
world
he
became
so
through
what
is
known
as
the
monroe
doctrine
during
the
wars
with
napoleon
the
king
of
spain
had
been
so
crushed
that
he
was
no
longer
strong
enough
to
govern
his
colonies
so
one
after
another
the
spanish
colonies
in
america
had
declared
themselves
free
and
had
set
up
as
independent
republics
but
spain
of
course
was
anxious
to
have
her
colonies
back
again
and
it
seemed
very
likely
that
the
king
would
ask
some
of
the
other
great
powers
in
europe
to
help
him
to
reconquer
them
monroe
however
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
wars
of
conquest
between
the
old
world
and
the
new
so
he
announced
that
the
continents
of
america
were
no
longer
to
be
looked
upon
as
open
to
colonisation
by
any
european
power
and
that
if
any
european
power
attempted
to
interfere
with
any
american
government
they
would
have
the
united
states
to
reckon
with
those
colonies
which
still
belonged
to
european
powers
would
be
left
alone
but
any
attempt
to
reconquer
colonies
which
had
declared
themselves
to
be
free
would
be
looked
upon
as
an
act
unfriendly
to
the
united
states
such
was
the
famous
monroe
doctrine
and
because
of
it
the
name
of
monroe
is
better
known
all
over
the
world
than
any
other
united
states
president
except
washington
the
british
were
quite
pleased
with
monroe
new
doctrine
the
other
great
powers
of
europe
were
not
but
they
yielded
to
it
and
dropped
their
plans
for
conquering
any
part
of
america
and
ever
since
the
doctrine
was
announced
the
continents
of
america
have
been
left
to
manage
their
own
affairs
chapter
adams
the
tariff
of
abominations
in
monroe
term
of
office
came
to
an
end
and
john
quincy
adams
became
president
he
was
the
son
of
john
adams
who
had
been
second
president
and
he
had
been
secretary
of
state
to
monroe
it
was
said
indeed
that
it
was
really
he
who
originated
the
famous
doctrine
which
came
to
be
called
by
monroe
name
he
was
an
honest
man
and
a
statesman
he
refused
to
give
offices
to
his
friends
just
because
they
were
his
friends
and
he
refused
to
turn
men
out
of
office
simply
because
they
did
not
agree
with
him
in
politics
he
wanted
to
do
what
was
right
and
just
but
he
did
it
from
a
cold
sense
of
duty
so
no
one
liked
him
very
much
both
house
and
senate
were
against
him
and
he
was
not
able
to
do
all
he
would
have
done
for
his
country
adams
wanted
to
do
a
great
deal
towards
improving
the
country
he
wanted
canals
to
be
cut
and
as
the
steam
engine
had
just
been
discovered
he
was
eager
to
have
railroads
and
bridges
but
congress
would
not
help
him
still
much
was
done
in
this
direction
several
canals
were
cut
railroads
began
to
be
built
and
the
rivers
were
covered
with
steamboats
manufacturers
also
began
to
flourish
for
during
the
war
it
had
been
very
difficult
to
get
manufactured
goods
from
foreign
countries
so
americans
had
begun
to
make
these
things
for
themselves
and
after
the
war
was
over
they
went
on
manufacturing
them
at
length
people
began
to
be
proud
of
using
only
american
made
things
and
when
adams
was
inaugurated
everything
he
wore
had
been
manufactured
in
the
states
the
factories
were
for
the
most
part
in
the
north
and
soon
the
northerners
began
to
clamour
for
duties
on
imported
goods
they
wanted
to
keep
out
foreign
goods
or
at
least
make
them
so
dear
that
it
would
pay
people
to
buy
american
made
goods
but
the
people
in
the
south
who
did
not
manufacture
things
themselves
wanted
the
duties
to
be
kept
low
however
the
manufacturers
won
the
day
and
twice
during
adams
presidency
bills
were
passed
by
which
the
tariff
was
made
higher
the
second
bill
made
the
duties
so
high
that
many
people
were
very
angry
and
called
it
the
tariff
of
abominations
in
the
south
indeed
many
people
were
so
angry
that
they
swore
never
to
buy
anything
from
the
north
until
the
tariff
was
made
lower
thus
once
again
north
and
south
were
pulling
different
ways
adams
would
willingly
have
been
president
for
a
second
term
but
in
spite
of
his
honesty
and
his
upright
dealings
no
one
liked
him
so
he
was
not
when
he
ceased
to
be
president
however
he
did
not
cease
to
take
an
interest
in
politics
and
for
many
years
after
he
was
a
member
of
congress
where
he
did
good
service
to
his
country
chapter
jackson
liberty
and
union
now
and
forever
van
buren
hard
times
in
andrew
jackson
the
great
soldier
became
president
all
the
presidents
up
till
now
had
been
well
born
men
aristocrats
in
fact
but
jackson
was
a
man
of
the
people
he
had
been
born
in
a
log
cabin
on
the
borders
of
north
and
south
carolina
he
had
very
little
schooling
and
all
his
life
he
was
never
able
to
write
correct
english
when
his
friends
first
asked
him
to
stand
for
president
he
laughed
do
you
suppose
he
said
that
i
am
such
a
fool
as
to
think
myself
fit
for
president
of
the
united
states
no
sir
i
know
what
i
am
fit
for
i
can
command
a
body
of
men
in
a
rough
way
but
i
am
not
fit
to
be
president
however
he
did
consent
to
stand
the
first
time
he
was
unsuccessful
and
adams
was
chosen
instead
the
second
time
he
was
brilliantly
successful
jackson
inauguration
was
a
triumph
hundreds
and
thousands
of
the
common
people
came
to
see
the
people
man
become
president
every
road
leading
to
the
capitol
was
so
thronged
that
the
procession
could
hardly
make
a
way
through
the
crowd
and
when
the
president
appeared
the
cheers
were
deafening
after
the
inauguration
was
over
there
was
a
great
reception
at
the
white
house
the
crush
was
tremendous
people
elbowed
each
other
and
almost
fought
for
a
sight
of
the
new
president
they
stood
on
the
satin
covered
chairs
in
their
muddy
boots
to
get
a
glimpse
of
him
over
the
heads
of
others
glasses
were
broken
and
wine
was
spilled
on
the
fine
carpets
in
fact
it
was
a
noisy
jollification
and
many
people
were
shocked
the
reign
of
king
mob
seemed
triumphant
said
an
old
gentleman
i
was
glad
to
escape
from
the
scene
as
soon
as
possible
but
jackson
did
not
mind
he
liked
to
see
people
enjoy
themselves
let
the
boys
have
a
good
time
once
in
four
years
he
said
jackson
was
a
man
of
the
people
but
he
was
an
autocrat
too
and
he
had
a
will
so
unbending
that
even
in
his
soldiering
days
he
had
been
called
old
hickory
so
now
old
hickory
had
a
cabinet
but
he
did
not
consult
them
he
simply
told
them
what
he
meant
to
do
his
real
cabinet
were
a
few
friends
who
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
government
they
used
to
see
him
in
private
and
go
in
and
out
by
a
back
door
so
they
got
the
name
of
the
kitchen
cabinet
and
this
kitchen
cabinet
had
much
more
to
do
with
administration
than
the
real
cabinet
as
president
jackson
did
many
good
things
but
he
did
one
bad
thing
he
began
what
is
known
as
the
spoils
system
before
when
a
new
president
was
elected
the
cabinet
secretaries
and
such
people
were
of
course
changed
also
but
jackson
was
not
content
with
that
he
thought
that
it
was
only
right
that
his
friends
who
had
helped
him
to
become
president
should
be
rewarded
so
he
turned
out
all
sorts
of
civil
servants
such
as
post
masters
customs
officers
and
clerks
of
all
sorts
this
he
did
not
because
they
were
dishonest
or
useless
or
unfit
for
their
positions
but
simply
because
they
did
not
think
as
he
did
in
politics
and
in
their
places
he
put
his
own
friends
who
did
think
as
he
did
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
he
thus
removed
two
thousand
people
it
is
said
the
whole
of
washington
too
was
filled
with
unrest
and
suspicion
no
man
knowing
when
it
would
be
his
turn
to
go
many
of
the
government
clerks
were
now
old
men
who
had
been
in
the
service
almost
since
the
government
was
established
when
they
were
turned
out
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
nothing
but
beggary
for
them
to
look
forward
to
in
consequence
there
was
a
great
deal
of
misery
and
poverty
but
the
removals
went
on
in
time
this
became
known
as
the
spoils
system
because
in
a
speech
a
senator
talking
of
this
matter
said
to
the
victor
belongs
the
spoils
of
the
enemy
but
something
much
more
serious
soon
began
to
call
for
attention
you
remember
that
the
tariff
bill
of
had
been
called
the
tariff
of
abominations
and
that
the
people
in
the
south
objected
to
it
very
much
a
feeling
had
begun
to
grow
up
that
the
interests
of
the
north
and
the
south
were
different
and
that
the
north
had
too
much
power
and
the
south
too
little
so
some
southern
men
began
to
declare
that
if
any
state
decided
that
a
law
made
by
congress
was
not
lawful
according
to
constitution
they
might
set
that
law
at
nought
in
their
own
state
and
utterly
disregard
it
this
was
called
nullification
because
it
made
a
law
null
and
void
wise
men
saw
at
once
that
if
this
was
allowed
it
would
simply
break
up
the
union
and
every
state
would
soon
do
just
as
it
liked
so
when
a
southern
statesman
announced
this
theory
of
delusion
and
folly
first
and
union
afterwards
daniel
webster
answered
him
webster
was
a
splendid
looking
man
with
a
great
mane
of
black
hair
and
flashing
black
eyes
he
was
too
a
magnificent
speaker
and
a
true
patriot
as
he
spoke
men
listened
in
breathless
silence
spellbound
by
the
low
clear
voice
in
burning
words
webster
called
to
their
love
of
country
he
touched
their
hearts
he
awoke
their
pride
he
appealed
to
their
plain
common
sense
let
us
not
see
upon
our
flag
he
said
those
words
of
delusion
and
folly
first
and
union
afterwards
but
everywhere
spread
all
over
in
characters
of
living
light
blazing
on
all
its
ample
folds
as
they
float
over
the
sea
and
over
the
land
and
in
every
wind
under
the
whole
heavens
that
other
sentiment
dear
to
every
true
american
heart
and
union
now
and
for
ever
one
and
inseparable
thus
webster
ended
his
great
speech
and
with
a
long
sigh
his
hearers
awoke
from
the
spell
he
had
laid
upon
them
awoke
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
world
greatest
orators
stood
among
them
that
crushes
nullification
said
james
madison
but
the
south
was
neither
convinced
nor
crushed
the
president
was
a
southern
man
it
was
known
that
he
disliked
high
tariffs
so
the
southerners
hoped
that
he
would
help
them
but
stern
old
hickory
would
lend
no
hand
to
break
up
the
union
on
jefferson
birthday
some
of
the
people
who
believed
in
nullification
gave
a
dinner
to
which
jackson
was
invited
and
asked
to
propose
a
toast
he
accepted
the
invitation
but
soon
discovered
that
the
dinner
was
not
meant
so
much
to
honour
the
memory
of
jefferson
as
to
advocate
nullification
and
all
the
toasts
hinted
at
it
presently
jackson
was
called
upon
for
his
toast
and
as
he
rose
deep
silence
fell
upon
the
company
then
in
a
clear
and
steady
voice
the
president
gave
his
toast
our
federal
union
it
must
and
shall
be
preserved
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
the
nullifiers
and
after
that
all
hope
of
help
from
the
president
was
lost
however
the
people
of
south
carolina
were
still
determined
and
in
they
declared
that
the
tariff
law
of
that
year
was
null
and
void
and
no
law
and
that
if
the
government
tried
to
force
them
to
regard
it
they
would
set
up
a
government
of
their
own
the
whole
state
was
in
wild
excitement
people
talked
openly
of
separating
from
the
union
a
president
was
chosen
and
medals
were
struck
bearing
the
inscription
first
president
of
the
southern
confederacy
if
this
thing
goes
on
said
jackson
our
country
will
be
like
a
bag
of
meal
with
both
ends
open
pick
it
up
in
the
middle
endwise
and
it
will
run
out
i
must
tie
the
bag
and
save
the
country
so
jackson
sent
a
proclamation
to
the
people
of
south
carolina
begging
them
to
think
before
they
dragged
their
state
into
war
for
war
they
should
have
he
told
them
plainly
if
they
persisted
in
their
ways
but
south
carolina
replied
defiantly
talking
of
tyranny
and
oppression
and
declaring
again
their
right
to
withdraw
from
the
union
if
they
wished
both
sides
were
so
defiant
that
it
seemed
as
if
there
might
indeed
be
war
but
there
was
none
south
carolina
found
that
the
other
southern
states
would
not
join
her
as
she
had
expected
so
when
the
government
yielded
so
far
as
to
reduce
the
tariff
to
some
extent
south
carolina
grew
quiet
again
and
the
danger
passed
jackson
was
twice
elected
president
and
at
the
end
of
his
second
term
two
states
were
added
to
the
union
in
june
arkansas
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
became
a
state
it
was
still
rather
a
wild
place
where
men
wore
long
knives
called
after
a
wild
rascal
captain
james
bowie
and
they
were
so
apt
to
use
them
on
the
slightest
occasions
that
the
state
was
nicknamed
the
toothpick
state
arkansas
came
in
as
a
slave
state
and
early
the
following
year
michigan
came
in
as
a
free
state
michigan
had
belonged
at
one
time
to
new
france
but
after
the
war
of
independence
britain
gave
it
up
to
the
united
states
when
it
became
part
of
the
north
west
territory
during
the
war
michigan
was
again
taken
by
the
british
but
they
only
kept
it
for
a
short
time
for
soon
after
captain
great
victory
it
was
won
back
again
by
the
americans
up
to
that
time
there
were
few
settlements
in
the
territory
but
gradually
more
people
came
to
settle
and
at
length
in
there
were
quite
enough
people
to
entitle
it
to
be
admitted
as
a
state
and
after
some
squabbling
with
ohio
over
the
question
of
boundaries
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
early
in
the
state
takes
its
name
from
the
great
lake
michigan
being
an
indian
word
meaning
great
sea
michigan
was
the
thirteenth
new
state
to
be
admitted
thus
since
the
revolution
the
number
of
states
had
been
exactly
doubled
in
martin
van
buren
became
president
he
had
been
secretary
of
state
and
then
and
had
been
a
great
favourite
with
jackson
who
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
become
president
after
him
van
buren
made
very
few
changes
in
the
cabinet
and
his
presidency
was
very
like
a
continuation
of
jackson
reign
yet
no
two
men
could
be
more
different
from
each
other
than
jackson
and
van
buren
jackson
was
rugged
quick
tempered
and
iron
willed
marching
straight
to
his
end
hacking
his
way
through
all
manner
of
difficulties
van
buren
was
a
smooth
tongued
sleek
little
man
who
said
his
enemies
never
gave
any
one
a
straight
answer
and
who
wrapped
up
his
ideas
and
opinions
in
so
many
words
that
nobody
could
be
sure
what
he
really
thought
about
any
subject
all
the
presidents
before
van
buren
had
been
of
british
descent
and
they
had
all
been
born
when
the
states
were
still
british
colonies
van
buren
was
dutch
and
he
had
been
born
after
the
revolution
was
complete
this
was
not
a
happy
time
for
america
for
the
whole
country
began
to
suffer
from
money
troubles
one
reason
for
this
was
that
people
had
been
trying
to
get
rich
too
fast
they
had
been
spending
more
than
they
had
in
order
to
make
still
more
great
factories
were
begun
and
never
finished
railroads
and
canals
were
built
which
did
not
pay
business
after
business
failed
bank
after
bank
shut
its
doors
and
then
to
add
to
the
troubles
there
was
a
bad
harvest
flour
became
ruinously
dear
and
the
poor
could
not
get
enough
to
eat
the
people
blamed
the
government
for
these
bad
times
deputation
after
deputation
went
to
the
president
asking
him
to
do
something
railing
at
him
as
the
cause
of
all
their
troubles
but
amid
all
the
clamour
van
buren
stood
calm
this
was
not
a
matter
he
said
in
which
the
government
ought
to
interfere
it
was
a
matter
for
the
people
themselves
and
he
bade
them
to
be
more
careful
and
industrious
and
things
would
soon
come
right
but
the
government
too
had
suffered
for
government
money
had
been
deposited
in
some
of
the
banks
which
had
failed
and
in
order
to
prevent
that
in
the
future
van
buren
now
proposed
a
plan
for
keeping
state
money
out
of
the
banks
so
that
the
state
should
not
be
hurt
by
any
bank
failing
this
came
to
be
called
the
subtreasury
system
there
was
a
good
deal
of
opposition
to
it
at
first
but
in
it
became
law
it
is
the
chief
thing
to
remember
about
van
buren
administration
it
is
also
one
of
those
things
which
become
more
interesting
as
we
grow
older
chapter
harrison
the
hero
of
tippecanoe
people
had
grown
to
dislike
van
buren
so
much
that
he
had
no
chance
of
being
elected
a
second
time
and
the
next
president
was
general
harrison
never
before
or
since
perhaps
has
there
been
so
much
excitement
over
the
election
of
a
president
for
van
buren
friends
tried
very
hard
to
have
him
and
harrison
friends
worked
just
as
hard
on
his
behalf
harrison
was
the
general
who
had
led
his
men
to
victory
at
tippecanoe
and
he
immediately
became
first
favourite
with
the
people
he
was
an
old
man
now
of
nearly
seventy
and
since
he
had
left
the
army
had
been
living
quietly
on
his
farm
in
the
country
so
one
of
van
buren
friends
said
scornfully
that
harrison
was
much
more
fit
to
live
in
a
log
cabin
and
drink
hard
cider
than
live
in
the
white
house
and
be
president
it
was
meant
as
a
sneer
but
harrison
good
friends
took
it
up
log
cabin
and
hard
cider
became
their
and
the
election
was
known
as
the
log
cabin
and
hard
cider
campaign
and
soon
many
simple
country
people
came
to
believe
that
harrison
really
lived
in
a
log
cabin
and
that
he
was
poor
and
had
to
work
for
his
living
even
as
an
old
man
all
sorts
of
songs
were
made
and
sung
about
this
gallant
old
farmer
oh
know
ye
the
farmer
of
tippecanoe
the
gallant
old
farmer
of
tippecanoe
with
an
arm
that
is
strong
and
a
heart
that
is
true
the
man
of
the
people
is
tippecanoe
that
is
the
beginning
of
one
song
and
there
were
dozens
more
like
it
and
while
the
old
farmer
of
tippecanoe
was
said
to
be
everything
that
was
good
and
honest
and
lovable
van
buren
on
the
other
hand
was
represented
as
being
a
bloated
aristocrat
who
sat
in
chairs
that
cost
six
hundred
dollars
ate
off
silver
plates
with
golden
forks
and
spoons
and
drove
about
in
an
english
coach
with
a
haughty
smile
on
his
face
it
was
a
time
of
terrible
excitement
and
each
side
gave
the
other
many
hard
knocks
but
in
the
end
harrison
was
elected
by
two
hundred
and
electoral
votes
to
van
buren
sixty
as
john
tyler
was
chosen
tippecanoe
and
tyler
too
had
been
one
of
the
election
cries
inauguration
day
was
bleak
and
cold
rain
threatened
and
a
chill
wind
blew
but
in
spite
of
unkind
weather
harrison
friends
arranged
a
grand
parade
and
mounted
on
a
white
horse
the
new
president
rode
for
two
hours
through
the
streets
then
for
another
hour
he
stood
in
the
chill
wind
reading
his
address
to
the
people
all
the
time
he
wore
no
overcoat
because
it
is
said
rumours
were
spread
abroad
that
he
was
not
strong
and
he
wanted
to
show
that
he
was
when
the
long
ceremony
was
at
length
over
he
was
thoroughly
chilled
but
no
serious
illness
followed
it
was
soon
seen
however
that
he
could
not
bear
the
strain
of
his
great
office
he
had
never
been
strong
of
late
years
he
had
been
used
to
a
quiet
country
life
seeing
few
people
and
taking
things
easily
now
from
morning
till
night
he
lived
in
a
whirl
he
was
besieged
with
people
who
wanted
posts
for
the
spoils
system
being
once
begun
every
president
was
almost
forced
to
continue
it
and
never
before
had
any
president
been
beset
by
such
a
buzzing
crowd
harrison
was
a
kindly
old
man
and
he
would
gladly
have
given
offices
to
all
who
asked
it
grieved
him
that
he
could
not
but
he
was
honest
too
and
he
tried
to
be
just
in
making
these
new
appointments
so
his
days
were
full
of
worry
and
anxious
thought
soon
under
the
heavy
burden
he
fell
and
just
a
month
after
his
inauguration
he
died
never
before
had
a
president
died
in
office
and
it
was
a
shock
to
the
whole
people
every
one
grieved
for
even
those
who
had
been
his
political
enemies
and
worked
hard
to
prevent
his
election
loved
the
good
old
man
death
stilled
every
whisper
of
anger
against
him
and
united
in
sorrow
the
whole
nation
mourned
his
loss
and
followed
him
reverently
to
the
grave
chapter
tyler
florida
becomes
a
state
john
tyler
now
became
president
at
first
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
what
he
should
be
called
adams
the
said
he
should
be
called
acting
as
president
but
that
was
much
too
long
someone
else
suggested
regent
but
that
smacked
too
much
of
royalty
but
the
people
did
not
worry
about
it
they
just
called
him
president
and
so
the
matter
settled
itself
one
important
matter
during
tyler
presidency
was
the
settling
of
the
boundary
between
british
america
and
maine
the
uncertainty
of
where
the
border
between
the
two
countries
really
was
had
caused
a
good
deal
of
friction
the
british
accusing
the
americans
and
the
americans
accusing
the
british
of
encroaching
on
their
territory
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
settle
it
but
hey
had
all
failed
and
both
sides
had
become
so
angry
over
it
that
it
was
very
nearly
a
question
of
war
but
now
at
last
the
question
was
thrashed
out
between
daniel
webster
the
great
orator
acting
for
the
united
states
and
lord
ashburton
acting
for
britain
lord
ashburton
came
out
to
washington
the
business
was
carried
through
in
a
friendly
fashion
and
settled
satisfactorily
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
during
time
of
office
this
was
florida
since
spain
had
given
up
florida
to
the
united
states
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
unrest
among
the
indians
and
at
last
the
settlers
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
send
them
out
of
the
country
altogether
so
the
settlers
made
a
treaty
with
the
indians
by
which
the
indians
agreed
to
accept
lands
in
the
west
instead
of
their
florida
lands
but
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
go
they
refused
to
move
and
a
war
which
lasted
seven
years
was
begun
it
was
a
terrible
war
and
thousands
of
lives
were
lost
on
either
side
for
the
indians
were
led
by
a
brave
and
wily
chief
named
osceola
but
at
length
they
were
defeated
they
were
then
removed
to
western
lands
as
had
been
agreed
only
about
three
hundred
were
allowed
to
remain
and
these
were
obliged
to
keep
to
the
extreme
south
of
the
province
the
war
ended
soon
after
tyler
became
president
then
land
was
offered
free
to
settlers
who
would
promise
to
remain
at
least
five
years
many
were
glad
to
get
land
on
such
easy
terms
and
soon
the
country
which
had
been
a
refuge
for
escaped
slaves
and
a
haunt
for
desperadoes
became
the
home
of
orderly
people
in
a
very
short
time
these
new
settlers
wished
to
join
the
union
but
at
first
they
could
not
agree
as
to
whether
florida
should
be
made
into
one
or
two
states
finally
however
it
was
decided
that
it
should
be
one
and
in
march
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
slave
state
chapter
polk
how
much
land
was
added
to
the
united
states
in
tyler
term
expired
and
james
knox
polk
became
president
he
had
been
a
long
time
in
congress
and
had
been
speaker
of
the
house
for
four
years
yet
nobody
had
heard
very
much
about
him
and
nearly
everyone
was
surprised
when
his
party
succeeded
in
electing
him
during
polk
term
of
office
three
states
were
admitted
to
the
union
the
first
of
these
was
the
great
state
of
texas
after
the
louisiana
purchase
the
united
states
had
claimed
texas
as
part
of
louisiana
but
the
spaniards
to
whom
all
mexico
belonged
disputed
their
claim
and
declared
that
texas
belonged
to
them
the
dispute
went
on
until
the
united
states
bought
florida
from
spain
then
in
part
payment
for
florida
the
americans
gave
up
all
claim
to
texas
but
really
this
agreement
could
matter
little
to
spain
for
the
mexicans
were
already
in
revolt
and
in
declared
themselves
independent
meanwhile
many
americans
began
to
settle
in
texas
the
united
states
government
began
to
feel
sorry
that
they
had
given
it
up
and
they
tried
to
buy
it
from
the
mexicans
the
mexicans
however
refused
to
sell
it
but
many
men
in
the
southern
states
became
more
and
more
anxious
to
get
texas
because
they
saw
that
if
they
did
not
get
some
more
territory
free
states
would
soon
outnumber
slave
states
for
all
the
land
south
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
had
been
used
up
the
only
part
left
being
set
aside
as
indian
territory
in
the
north
on
the
other
hand
there
was
still
land
enough
out
of
which
to
carve
four
or
five
states
all
the
americans
who
had
settled
in
texas
were
slave
holders
and
when
mexico
abolished
slavery
texas
refused
to
do
so
this
refusal
of
course
brought
trouble
and
at
length
the
texans
declaring
that
the
government
of
mexico
was
tyrannical
rose
in
rebellion
against
mexico
and
declared
themselves
a
republic
but
the
mexicans
would
not
allow
this
great
territory
to
revolt
without
an
effort
to
keep
it
so
they
sent
an
army
to
fight
the
texans
the
leader
of
the
mexican
army
was
santa
anna
the
mexican
president
the
leader
of
the
texans
was
general
sam
houston
sam
houston
was
an
adventurous
american
who
a
year
or
two
before
had
settled
in
texas
he
had
had
a
varied
life
he
had
been
a
soldier
a
lawyer
a
congressman
and
finally
governor
of
a
state
then
he
had
suddenly
thrown
everything
up
had
gone
to
live
among
the
indians
and
was
adopted
into
an
indian
tribe
while
he
was
living
with
the
indians
wild
stories
of
his
doings
were
spread
about
one
story
was
that
he
meant
to
conquer
texas
and
make
himself
emperor
of
that
country
but
houston
had
really
no
intention
of
founding
a
nation
in
the
war
with
texas
the
mexicans
were
at
first
successful
and
the
terrified
people
fled
before
them
but
at
the
battle
of
san
jacinto
the
texans
utterly
defeated
the
mexicans
the
rout
was
complete
and
the
mexicans
fled
in
every
direction
among
them
their
leader
santa
anna
mounted
on
a
splendid
black
horse
he
fled
toward
a
bridge
crossing
a
river
which
flowed
near
but
when
he
reached
the
bridge
he
found
that
the
texans
had
destroyed
it
he
was
being
hotly
pursued
by
the
enemy
so
without
pausing
a
moment
he
spurred
his
horse
into
the
river
swam
across
and
to
the
surprise
of
his
pursuers
climbed
the
steep
cliff
of
the
opposite
side
and
disappeared
darkness
now
fell
and
the
texans
gave
up
the
pursuit
but
next
morning
they
set
out
again
to
scour
the
country
in
search
of
fugitives
meanwhile
santa
anna
having
abandoned
his
horse
and
changed
his
clothes
in
a
forsaken
cottage
was
trying
to
make
his
way
to
the
mexican
border
presently
however
one
of
the
search
parties
came
upon
a
little
man
dressed
in
blue
cotton
coat
and
trousers
a
leather
cap
and
red
woolen
slippers
he
was
a
miserable
looking
object
and
when
he
saw
the
texans
approach
he
tried
to
hide
himself
in
the
grass
he
was
soon
found
however
and
when
the
texans
asked
him
who
he
was
he
said
he
was
a
private
soldier
the
texans
then
told
him
to
follow
them
to
the
camp
and
when
he
said
he
could
not
walk
he
mounted
on
one
of
their
horses
and
riding
behind
a
texan
he
was
led
into
camp
the
texans
had
no
idea
who
they
had
captured
until
they
reached
their
camp
then
when
the
mexican
prisoners
saw
the
queer
little
figure
they
exclaimed
the
president
the
president
only
then
did
the
texans
discover
what
a
great
man
they
had
captured
houston
had
been
wounded
in
the
battle
and
was
lying
on
a
mattress
under
the
tree
when
santa
anna
was
led
before
him
i
am
general
antonio
lopez
de
santa
anna
said
the
prisoner
and
a
prisoner
of
war
at
your
disposal
houston
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
then
signed
him
to
sit
down
on
a
box
which
stood
near
and
there
under
the
spreading
branches
of
the
tree
a
truce
was
arranged
and
santa
anna
wrote
letters
to
his
generals
telling
them
to
cease
fighting
the
texans
wanted
to
hang
santa
anna
for
his
cruelties
during
the
war
but
houston
saved
him
from
their
wrath
and
after
he
had
signed
a
treaty
acknowledging
the
independence
of
texas
he
was
set
free
texas
now
declared
itself
a
republic
and
of
this
new
state
general
sam
houston
old
sam
jacinto
as
he
was
affectionately
nicknamed
was
chosen
president
the
flag
chosen
for
the
republic
was
blue
with
a
single
yellow
star
in
the
middle
and
from
this
flag
texas
came
to
be
called
the
lone
star
state
the
texans
had
declared
themselves
a
free
and
independent
nation
but
as
a
republic
texas
was
very
small
and
the
texans
had
no
intention
of
remaining
a
lonely
insignificant
republic
what
they
desired
was
to
join
the
united
states
and
very
soon
they
asked
to
be
admitted
to
the
union
but
texas
lay
south
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
and
although
small
for
an
independent
republic
it
was
huge
for
a
state
and
might
be
cut
up
into
three
or
four
therefore
the
people
in
the
north
were
very
much
against
texas
being
admitted
to
the
union
as
it
would
increase
the
strength
of
the
slave
states
enormously
but
the
southerners
were
determined
to
have
texas
and
at
last
in
it
was
admitted
as
a
slave
state
the
two
last
states
which
had
been
added
to
the
union
that
it
florida
and
texas
were
both
slave
states
but
they
were
soon
balanced
by
two
free
states
iowa
and
wisconsin
iowa
is
an
indian
name
meaning
sleepy
ones
the
state
was
called
after
a
tribe
of
indians
of
that
name
who
were
there
when
the
frenchmen
first
explored
the
country
it
was
the
first
free
state
to
be
carved
out
of
the
louisiana
purchase
wisconsin
was
part
of
the
northwest
territory
and
was
the
last
part
of
it
to
be
organised
as
a
state
like
many
other
states
wisconsin
takes
its
name
from
its
chief
river
which
means
gathering
waters
there
are
many
lead
mines
in
wisconsin
and
these
had
been
worked
in
a
poor
sort
of
way
by
the
indians
and
when
white
people
began
to
work
them
there
was
trouble
between
them
and
the
redmen
at
different
times
red
bird
and
black
hawk
rose
against
the
whites
but
both
were
defeated
at
length
the
disputes
were
settled
by
treaties
with
the
indians
and
the
land
began
to
be
peopled
by
whites
wisconsin
is
often
called
the
badger
state
it
got
this
name
not
because
badgers
are
to
be
found
there
but
because
the
lead
miners
instead
of
building
houses
used
to
dig
out
caves
in
the
hillsides
and
live
in
them
summer
and
winter
from
this
they
were
nicknamed
badgers
and
the
state
became
known
as
the
badger
state
besides
texas
another
great
territory
was
added
to
the
states
at
this
time
and
another
boundary
dispute
between
british
america
and
the
united
states
was
settled
for
many
years
both
britain
and
the
united
states
had
claimed
the
oregon
territory
the
americans
claimed
it
by
right
of
captain
gray
discovery
of
the
columbia
river
and
also
by
right
of
the
exploration
of
lewis
and
clark
the
british
claimed
it
by
right
of
the
discoveries
of
sir
alexander
mackenzie
and
also
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
occupied
by
hudson
bay
company
three
times
attempts
had
been
made
to
settle
the
boundary
but
each
time
the
attempts
had
failed
at
length
the
two
countries
agreed
to
occupy
it
jointly
this
arrangement
was
to
come
to
an
end
by
either
country
giving
a
year
notice
president
polk
appetite
for
land
was
huge
he
wanted
the
whole
of
oregon
for
the
united
states
so
in
the
joint
agreement
came
to
an
end
and
new
efforts
for
final
settlement
began
many
others
were
as
eager
as
the
president
to
have
the
whole
of
oregon
and
forty
or
fight
became
a
forty
was
the
imaginary
line
or
parallel
of
latitude
on
the
north
of
the
disputed
territory
so
that
the
cry
forty
or
fight
meant
that
these
hotspurs
demanded
the
whole
of
oregon
or
war
with
great
britain
on
the
other
hand
some
people
thought
a
ridiculous
fuss
was
being
made
over
an
utterly
useless
piece
of
land
what
do
we
want
with
it
they
said
what
are
we
to
do
with
it
how
could
a
bit
of
land
five
thousand
miles
away
ever
become
part
of
the
united
states
it
is
absurd
steam
said
someone
would
make
it
possible
railways
would
bring
oregon
near
to
the
seat
of
government
steam
cried
the
objectors
railways
across
the
rocky
mountains
rubbish
the
british
on
their
side
did
not
want
the
whole
of
oregon
but
they
wanted
the
land
as
far
south
as
the
columbia
river
however
in
the
end
both
sides
gave
way
a
little
it
was
agreed
to
halve
the
country
and
the
parallel
was
taken
as
the
boundary
thus
another
large
territory
was
added
to
the
states
and
the
northern
frontiers
peacefully
settled
from
east
to
west
but
polk
land
hunger
was
not
yet
satisfied
he
had
half
of
oregon
he
had
the
whole
of
texas
but
he
wanted
more
he
waned
california
but
california
belonged
to
mexico
he
tried
to
buy
it
from
mexico
but
mexico
would
not
sell
it
polk
however
was
determined
to
have
it
so
determined
was
he
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
fight
for
it
if
there
was
no
other
way
of
getting
it
it
was
easy
to
find
an
excuse
for
war
the
boundaries
of
texas
were
very
uncertain
and
a
tract
of
land
lying
east
of
the
rio
grande
river
was
claimed
by
both
texas
and
by
mexico
in
polk
sent
an
army
to
take
possession
of
this
land
general
zachary
taylor
was
in
command
of
this
expedition
and
when
he
arrived
near
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
and
began
to
build
a
fort
the
mexicans
were
very
angry
they
sent
him
a
message
ordering
him
to
be
gone
in
hours
of
course
taylor
refused
to
go
and
he
began
to
blockade
the
river
so
as
to
stop
trade
with
mexico
the
mexicans
then
made
ready
to
fight
and
next
morning
they
attacked
and
captured
a
scouting
party
of
americans
when
the
news
reached
washington
there
was
great
excitement
mexico
has
passed
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
declared
the
president
has
invaded
our
territory
and
shed
american
blood
on

he
said
notwithstanding
all
our
efforts
to
avoid
it
exists
by
the
act
of
mexico
herself
some
of
the
people
however
did
not
believe
that
mexico
was
wholly
to
blame
for
beginning
the
war
and
a
young
congressman
named
abraham
lincoln
asked
the
president
to
state
the
exact
spot
on
american
territory
where
american
blood
had
been
spilled
this
was
called
the
spot
resolution
but
in
spite
of
any
protest
that
was
made
war
was
declared
and
volunteers
came
pouring
in
from
every
side
the
war
lasted
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
from
the
first
the
mexicans
had
the
worst
of
it
throughout
the
whole
war
they
never
won
a
battle
besides
general
taylor
army
the
mexicans
soon
had
two
more
to
fight
in
the
north
general
kearney
marched
into
new
mexico
and
took
possession
of
it
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
then
he
marched
into
california
and
claimed
that
also
in
the
south
the
general
scott
landed
at
vera
cruz
and
after
taking
the
town
he
marched
triumphantly
on
conquering
everything
on
his
way
till
he
reached
mexico
city
and
the
war
was
practically
at
an
end
it
was
not
however
until
february
of
the
following
year
that
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
in
mexico
and
not
till
the
of
july
was
it
proclaimed
in
washington
by
it
a
great
tract
of
land
was
given
to
the
united
states
stretching
from
the
borders
of
texas
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
and
from
the
present
northern
border
of
mexico
to
oregon
chapter
polk
the
finding
of
gold
in
return
for
the
great
tract
of
land
ceded
to
the
united
states
mexico
received
million
dollars
but
the
mexicans
little
knew
what
a
golden
land
they
were
parting
with
and
what
a
bad
bargain
they
were
making
nine
days
before
the
treaty
was
signed
gold
was
found
in
california
but
news
traveled
slowly
in
those
days
and
the
treaty
was
signed
before
the
mexicans
knew
of
the
great
discovery
some
time
before
this
a
swiss
named
sutter
had
settled
in
the
sacramento
valley
he
had
prospered
greatly
and
had
become
a
regular
little
potentate
ruling
the
whole
district
round
he
had
thousands
of
horses
and
cattle
and
hundreds
of
men
worked
for
him
both
white
men
and
indians
now
he
wanted
to
build
a
saw
mill
and
a
man
named
marshall
a
settler
from
the
east
undertook
to
build
it
for
him
marshall
was
a
moody
queer
tempered
man
but
he
was
a
good
workman
so
about
fifty
miles
from
sutter
fort
the
saw
mill
was
begun
now
one
day
while
marshall
was
walking
beside
the
mill
stream
inspecting
the
work
he
saw
something
yellow
and
shining
among
the
loose
earth
and
gravel
which
was
being
carried
down
by
the
stream
at
first
he
thought
little
about
it
but
as
again
and
again
he
saw
these
shining
grains
he
at
length
thought
that
they
might
be
gold
and
picked
some
up
next
morning
he
again
went
to
inspect
the
mill
stream
and
there
he
found
a
piece
of
the
shining
stuff
bigger
than
any
he
had
found
the
day
before
marshall
picked
up
the
piece
and
when
he
felt
it
heavy
in
his
hand
he
began
to
feel
a
little
excited
could
it
really
be
gold
he
asked
himself
marshall
did
not
know
much
about
gold
but
he
knew
that
it
was
heavy
and
that
it
was
fairly
soft
so
he
bit
and
hammered
it
with
stones
and
finding
that
it
was
easily
beaten
out
he
at
last
decided
that
it
was
indeed
gold
so
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
to
sutter
to
tell
him
of
his
wonderful
discovery
it
was
a
pouring
wet
day
in
january
and
when
marshall
reached
the
fort
he
was
soaked
through
but
he
took
no
thought
of
that
and
marching
right
into
sutter
office
with
something
of
an
air
of
mystery
asked
for
a
private
talk
sutter
wondered
what
had
brought
marshall
back
from
the
mill
and
he
wondered
still
more
at
the
mysterious
air
soon
he
understood
for
marshall
took
out
a
little
bag
and
emptying
what
it
held
into
his
hand
held
it
out
to
sutter
i
believe
this
is
gold
he
said
it
certainly
looks
like
it
said
sutter
in
surprise
then
marshall
told
how
he
had
found
it
in
the
mill
stream
and
that
he
believed
there
were
tons
of
it
sutter
was
a
very
great
man
in
the
countryside
and
he
had
things
which
no
one
else
dreamed
of
having
among
these
was
an
encyclopedia
so
he
looked
up
the
article
on
gold
and
read
it
carefully
and
then
the
two
men
tried
all
the
tests
they
had
at
command
and
at
last
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
shining
grains
which
marshall
had
found
were
certainly
gold
sutter
would
have
been
glad
to
keep
the
secret
for
a
little
time
at
least
until
his
mill
was
finished
but
such
a
secret
could
not
be
kept
soon
every
one
round
knew
of
the
great
discovery
the
sawmill
was
left
unfinished
the
workmen
went
off
to
dig
for
gold
and
everyone
else
followed
their
example
the
towns
were
deserted
shops
and
offices
were
shut
up
houses
were
left
half
built
fields
were
left
unploughed
horses
and
cattle
roamed
about
uncared
for
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
lawyers
doctors
labourers
threw
down
their
tools
or
their
pens
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
departed
for
the
gold
fields
some
went
by
sea
and
those
who
could
not
get
passage
in
ships
hired
any
small
craft
which
they
could
find
they
put
to
sea
in
the
most
rotten
or
frail
little
boats
willing
to
brave
any
danger
if
only
they
might
at
length
reach
the
land
of
gold
others
went
by
land
some
rode
on
horseback
or
drove
in
a
wagon
others
went
on
foot
all
the
way
carrying
with
them
nothing
but
a
spade
or
shovel
it
was
a
mad
rush
for
wealth
every
one
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
wonderful
news
was
seized
with
the
gold
fever
when
ships
came
into
port
the
sailors
heard
the
news
and
they
deserted
wholesale
and
the
ships
were
left
to
rock
at
anchor
without
a
soul
on
board
prisoners
broke
prison
and
fled
to
the
gold
fields
warders
followed
not
to
take
them
but
to
remain
and
dig
newspapers
could
not
be
issued
because
the
printers
had
all
run
off
every
industry
was
neglected
except
the
making
of
spades
and
picks
and
the
price
of
these
rose
and
rose
till
they
could
not
be
had
for
less
than
ten
dollars
apiece
and
it
is
said
that
even
fifty
dollars
was
offered
for
one
but
in
some
places
upon
the
gold
fields
picks
and
shovels
were
not
needed
for
all
the
men
had
to
do
was
to
pick
at
the
seams
with
their
pocket
knives
to
get
enough
gold
to
make
them
rich
at
first
it
was
only
from
california
oregon
and
the
western
settlements
that
men
rushed
to
the
gold
fields
for
although
the
telegraph
had
been
discovered
a
short
time
before
this
there
were
neither
telegraphs
nor
railroads
in
the
west
but
soon
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
too
the
news
spread
it
spread
to
the
eastern
states
then
to
europe
and
from
all
over
the
world
the
rush
came
every
ship
that
would
float
put
to
sea
many
instead
of
going
their
usual
routes
sailed
for
california
the
whale
fisheries
were
neglected
and
the
whalers
took
to
mining
the
fleets
of
all
the
world
seemed
to
make
for
the
shores
of
america
across
the
continent
too
long
trains
of
lumbering
wagons
drawn
by
oxen
slowly
wound
they
were
tented
over
and
were
so
huge
that
whole
families
lived
in
them
and
they
were
given
the
name
of
prairie
schooners
all
day
long
they
crawled
along
and
as
dusk
fell
they
gathered
into
groups
fires
were
lit
tents
pitched
for
the
night
then
early
next
morning
the
travelers
would
be
astir
again
and
so
day
after
day
through
lonely
uninhabited
wildernesses
the
caravans
moved
on
in
one
unending
stream
great
tented
wagons
carts
carriages
horsemen
or
even
walkers
moved
along
all
going
in
the
same
direction
to
the
golden
land
of
the
west
many
were
the
dangers
these
adventurous
travelers
had
to
brave
there
were
dangers
from
hostile
indians
and
from
wild
animals
from
lack
of
food
and
water
and
above
all
from
sickness
cholera
broke
out
in
these
trains
and
many
a
man
who
had
set
out
gaily
found
a
grave
by
the
wayside
and
never
reached
the
land
of
his
golden
hopes
the
road
too
was
strewn
with
broken
down
wagons
and
the
bones
of
oxen
and
horses
and
many
had
to
finish
their
weary
journey
on
foot
but
in
spite
of
all
mischances
hundreds
and
thousands
reached
the
gold
fields
and
all
over
the
sacramento
valley
or
wherever
gold
was
found
little
towns
sprang
up
these
were
towns
of
wooden
shanties
and
canvas
tents
and
whenever
the
gold
gave
out
or
news
came
of
some
richer
mine
the
diggers
would
forsake
the
little
town
and
rush
off
somewhere
else
and
no
sign
of
life
would
be
left
in
the
once
busy
valley
save
the
huts
and
the
upturned
earth
some
men
made
fortunes
almost
in
a
day
many
returned
home
well
off
but
by
far
the
greater
number
returned
poorer
than
they
came
and
with
their
health
shattered
by
the
hardships
of
the
life
many
more
never
returned
at
all
but
found
a
nameless
grave
among
the
lonely
valleys
others
made
fortunes
again
and
again
and
lost
them
as
quickly
as
they
made
them
for
though
at
first
the
men
who
went
to
the
gold
fields
were
for
the
most
part
young
and
strong
and
honest
the
greed
of
gain
soon
brought
all
the
of
the
towns
many
men
joined
the
throng
who
had
no
intention
of
working
and
who
but
came
to
lure
the
gold
away
from
those
who
had
found
it
so
gambling
saloons
and
drinking
saloons
sprang
up
everywhere
and
many
a
man
left
them
poorer
if
not
wiser
murders
became
frequent
but
men
thought
little
about
them
every
man
went
armed
and
if
he
could
not
protect
himself
it
was
his
own
fault
theft
was
looked
upon
as
a
far
worse
sin
for
everybody
lived
in
frail
wooden
juts
or
open
tents
they
had
no
means
of
locking
up
their
gold
and
thought
nothing
of
leaving
it
lying
about
quite
unprotected
but
when
criminals
and
lowdown
ruffians
began
to
come
things
were
changed
until
at
last
many
were
afraid
to
have
it
known
that
they
possessed
gold
lest
they
should
be
murdered
for
it
among
the
many
who
did
not
make
fortunes
out
of
the
finding
of
gold
were
marshall
and
sutter
neither
of
them
was
lucky
as
a
miner
and
both
of
them
died
in
poverty
chapter
taylor
union
or
disunion
polk
had
no
chance
of
being
as
president
for
many
people
looked
upon
the
war
with
mexico
as
a
great
wrong
and
as
a
stain
upon
the
flag
so
even
although
it
had
given
to
the
united
states
california
and
all
its
untold
wealth
polk
was
not
forgiven
for
having
brought
the
war
about
and
while
the
people
were
rushing
from
all
corners
of
the
globe
to
california
a
new
president
was
inaugurated
this
new
president
was
no
other
than
general
zachary
taylor
who
had
become
famous
during
the
mexican
war
for
people
did
not
blame
him
for
the
war
he
had
only
obeyed
orders
as
a
soldier
must
and
every
one
admired
his
bravery
and
skill
he
was
a
rough
old
soldier
and
his
men
called
him
old
rough
and
ready
and
when
he
first
heard
that
people
wanted
to
make
him
president
like
jackson
that
other
rough
old
soldier
before
him
he
simply
laughed
at
the
idea
i
am
not
vain
enough
to
think
that
i
am
fit
to
be
president
he
said
i
would
gladly
see
some
other
citizen
more
worthy
chosen
for
that
high
office
old
rough
and
ready
was
a
soldier
and
nothing
but
a
soldier
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
politics
and
had
never
even
voted
however
when
people
insisted
that
he
should
be
president
he
began
rather
to
like
the
idea
and
at
length
consented
to
be
a
candidate
and
was
elected
because
of
the
discovery
of
gold
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
flocked
to
california
and
although
many
returned
to
their
homes
again
many
also
remained
in
california
and
made
their
homes
in
the
sunny
land
so
it
came
about
that
california
was
peopled
faster
than
any
other
part
of
america
and
in
less
than
two
years
after
the
discovery
of
gold
it
asked
to
be
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
state
but
before
it
was
admitted
a
fierce
battle
had
to
be
fought
for
the
californians
wanted
the
state
to
be
admitted
as
a
free
state
now
part
of
california
lay
south
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
so
the
southerners
were
angry
and
declared
that
california
must
be
divided
into
two
and
that
the
southern
part
must
come
into
the
union
as
a
slave
state
the
southerners
felt
that
they
had
a
right
to
be
angry
for
they
had
helped
to
bring
on
the
mexican
war
for
the
purpose
of
getting
more
territory
south
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
so
that
they
should
be
sure
of
slave
states
to
balance
the
free
states
of
the
north
they
had
won
the
land
and
now
victory
would
be
turned
to
defeat
if
the
new
states
were
admitted
as
free
states
so
they
threatened
as
they
had
threatened
before
to
break
away
from
the
union
if
they
were
not
listened
to
no
sooner
was
taylor
inaugurated
than
he
had
to
turn
his
attention
to
this
great
matter
the
southerners
were
determined
to
use
all
their
power
to
get
their
way
and
senator
john
caldwell
calhoun
an
old
man
who
for
years
had
been
a
champion
of
slavery
determined
to
speak
once
more
for
the
cause
calhoun
was
so
old
and
ill
that
he
could
hardly
walk
and
he
tottered
into
the
senate
chamber
leaning
on
the
arms
of
two
friends
he
was
far
too
feeble
to
read
his
speech
so
pale
and
deathlike
he
sat
in
his
chair
while
a
friend
read
it
for
him
the
south
must
have
a
share
in
the
new
territory
he
said
if
you
of
the
north
will
not
do
this
then
let
our
southern
states
separate
and
depart
in
peace
this
was
the
great
statesman
last
word
to
his
country
three
weeks
later
he
lay
dead
he
was
the
greatest
of
southern
politicians
he
really
believed
that
slavery
was
a
good
thing
and
that
life
in
the
south
would
be
impossible
without
it
and
loving
his
country
deeply
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
its
ruin
the
south
the
poor
south
he
murmured
as
he
lay
dying
god
knows
what
will
become
of
her
the
next
great
speech
was
made
by
daniel
webster
twenty
years
had
come
and
gone
since
he
made
his
first
great
speech
for
union
now
thousands
turned
to
him
begging
him
to
reconcile
the
north
and
south
and
on
the
day
he
made
his
speech
the
senate
chamber
was
packed
from
floor
to
ceiling
i
speak
today
he
said
not
as
a
massachusetts
man
nor
as
a
northern
man
but
as
an
american
having
no
locality
but
america
i
speak
today
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
hear
me
for
my
cause
but
to
the
men
burning
with
zeal
against
slavery
his
speech
seemed
lukewarm
the
law
of
nature
he
said
settles
forever
that
slavery
can
not
exist
in
california
it
was
a
useless
taunt
and
reproach
to
the
slave
holders
to
forbid
slavery
where
slavery
could
not
exist
he
blamed
the
north
for
having
fallen
short
in
its
duty
to
the
south
and
declared
that
the
south
had
just
cause
for
complaint
many
applauded
this
speech
but
to
others
it
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
webster
cried
one
is
a
fallen
star
lucifer
descending
from
heaven
a
third
great
speech
was
made
four
days
later
by
william
seward
he
spoke
for
union
slavery
must
vanish
from
the
union
he
said
but
it
would
vanish
peacefully
he
brushed
aside
as
impossible
the
thought
that
any
state
should
break
away
from
the
union
i
shall
vote
for
the
admission
of
california
directly
he
said
without
conditions
without
qualifications
and
without
compromise
the
washington
monument
but
still
the
debate
went
on
summer
came
and
on
the
of
july
there
was
a
great
ceremony
for
the
laying
of
the
foundation
stone
of
the
washington
monument
the
president
was
present
and
sat
for
hours
in
the
blazing
sun
then
feeling
very
tired
he
went
home
and
drank
iced
milk
and
ate
some
cherries
that
night
he
became
very
ill
and
a
few
days
later
he
died
i
have
tried
to
do
my
duty
he
said
then
the
brave
and
honest
old
soldier
laid
down
his
heavy
burden
and
was
at
rest
once
again
a
sad
procession
left
the
white
house
and
wound
slowly
through
the
streets
lined
with
soldiers
behind
the
funeral
car
was
led
the
president
old
war
horse
which
he
would
never
mount
again
the
people
wept
to
see
it
and
the
whole
nation
mourned
for
the
brave
old
soldier
who
had
tried
to
do
his
duty
chapter
fillmore
the
underground
railroad
the
millard
fillmore
now
became
president
he
was
the
son
of
very
poor
parents
he
had
picked
up
an
education
how
he
could
and
he
was
nineteen
before
he
saw
a
history
or
a
map
of
his
own
country
but
he
was
determined
to
become
a
lawyer
and
after
a
hard
struggle
he
succeeded
then
from
step
to
step
he
rose
till
he
had
now
reached
the
highest
office
in
the
land
under
the
new
president
the
debate
over
california
still
went
on
but
at
length
the
matter
was
settled
and
california
was
admitted
as
a
free
state
this
was
on
the
of
september
but
the
news
did
not
reach
california
until
october
for
months
the
people
had
been
waiting
for
an
answer
to
their
petition
and
as
the
days
went
past
they
grew
more
and
more
impatient
but
at
last
one
morning
san
francisco
was
filled
with
excitement
for
the
oregon
was
seen
coming
into
harbour
gaily
decorated
with
flags
with
shouts
of
joy
the
people
ran
down
to
the
wharf
for
they
knew
the
oregon
would
never
come
in
with
flags
flying
in
such
a
way
if
she
were
not
bringing
good
news
and
when
they
heard
the
news
they
laughed
and
cried
and
kissed
each
other
in
joy
cannon
were
fired
and
bells
rung
shops
were
shut
and
every
one
went
holidaying
messengers
too
were
sent
in
every
direction
stage
coaches
with
teams
ran
races
to
be
the
first
to
bring
the
news
to
outlying
towns
and
villages
as
the
coaches
dashed
through
villages
men
on
them
shouted
the
news
and
the
villagers
would
shout
and
laugh
in
return
then
leaping
on
their
horses
they
would
ride
off
to
tell
some
neighbour
so
throughout
the
land
the
news
was
carried
by
the
admission
of
california
to
the
union
as
a
free
state
the
states
were
greatly
strengthened
but
in
some
degree
to
make
up
for
this
a
very
strict
law
about
the
arrest
of
runaway
slaves
was
passed
this
was
called
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
it
was
bad
and
cruel
for
by
it
if
a
negro
were
caught
even
by
some
one
who
had
no
right
to
him
he
had
no
chance
of
freedom
a
negro
was
not
allowed
to
speak
for
himself
and
he
was
not
allowed
the
benefit
of
a
jury
also
any
person
who
helped
a
slave
to
run
away
or
protected
him
when
he
had
run
away
might
be
fined
the
north
hated
the
bill
but
it
was
passed
many
people
however
made
up
their
minds
not
to
obey
it
for
conscience
told
them
that
slavery
was
wrong
and
conscience
was
a
higher
law
so
when
men
came
to
the
free
states
to
catch
runaway
slaves
they
were
received
with
anger
and
everything
was
done
to
hinder
them
in
their
work
the
underground
railroad
too
became
more
active
than
ever
this
underground
railroad
was
not
a
railroad
and
it
was
not
underground
it
was
simply
a
chain
of
houses
about
twenty
miles
or
so
apart
where
escaped
slaves
might
be
sure
of
a
kindly
welcome
the
railroad
was
managed
by
men
who
felt
pity
for
the
slaves
and
helped
them
to
escape
it
went
in
direct
roads
across
the
states
to
canada
the
escaping
slaves
moved
so
secretly
from
one
house
to
another
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
they
must
have
gone
underground
so
the
system
came
to
be
called
the
underground
railroad
and
the
friendly
houses
were
the
stations
once
a
runaway
slave
reached
one
of
these
friendly
houses
or
stations
he
would
be
hidden
in
the
attic
or
cellar
or
some
safe
place
there
he
would
be
fed
and
cared
for
until
night
came
again
then
the
password
would
be
given
to
him
and
directions
how
to
reach
the
next
underground
station
and
with
the
pole
star
for
his
guide
he
would
set
out
arriving
at
the
house
in
the
dusk
of
early
morning
before
any
one
was
astir
he
would
knock
softly
at
the
door
who
there
would
be
asked
then
the
runaway
would
give
the
password
in
answer
perhaps
it
would
be
william
penn
or
a
friend
of
friends
or
sometimes
the
signal
would
be
the
hoot
of
an
owl
and
hearing
it
the
master
of
the
underground
station
would
rise
and
let
the
passenger
in
sometimes
the
slavers
would
come
alone
sometimes
in
twos
and
threes
or
even
more
as
many
as
seventeen
were
hidden
one
day
at
one
of
the
stations
thousands
of
slaves
were
in
this
way
helped
to
escape
every
year
it
was
a
dangerous
employment
for
the
and
many
were
found
out
and
fined
they
paid
the
fines
they
did
not
care
for
that
and
went
on
helping
the
poor
slaves
most
of
the
people
connected
with
the
underground
railroad
were
white
but
some
were
coloured
one
of
the
most
daring
of
these
was
harriet
tubman
she
helped
so
many
of
her
countrymen
to
escape
that
they
called
her
moses
because
she
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
bondage
she
was
nearly
white
but
had
been
a
slave
herself
and
having
escaped
from
that
fearful
bondage
she
now
spent
her
life
in
trying
to
free
others
again
and
again
in
spite
of
the
danger
in
being
caught
she
ventured
into
the
southern
states
to
bring
back
a
band
of
runaway
slaves
and
she
was
so
clever
and
so
full
of
resource
that
she
always
brought
them
safely
away
more
than
once
when
she
saw
she
was
being
tracked
she
put
herself
and
her
little
company
into
a
train
taking
tickets
for
them
southwards
for
she
knew
that
no
one
would
suspect
them
to
be
runaway
slaves
if
they
were
traveling
south
then
when
their
track
was
covered
and
danger
of
pursuit
over
they
all
turned
north
again
harriet
was
both
brave
and
clever
and
when
the
civil
war
broke
out
she
served
as
a
scout
for
the
northern
army
earning
the
praise
of
those
who
employed
her
she
lived
to
be
very
old
and
died
not
many
years
ago
happy
to
know
that
all
her
countrymen
were
free
but
although
many
slaves
tried
to
run
away
all
slaves
were
not
unhappy
when
they
had
a
kind
master
they
were
well
taken
care
of
and
lived
in
far
greater
comfort
that
if
they
had
been
free
in
the
more
northerly
of
the
slave
states
such
as
virginia
the
slaves
were
generally
household
servants
and
were
treated
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
it
was
farther
south
in
the
cotton
growing
districts
where
slaves
worked
in
gangs
under
the
whip
of
the
overseer
who
was
often
brutal
that
the
real
misery
was
but
even
with
the
kindest
of
masters
a
slave
could
never
feel
safe
for
that
master
might
die
or
lose
his
money
and
have
to
sell
his
slaves
then
husband
and
wife
parents
and
children
might
be
sold
to
different
masters
and
never
see
each
other
again
the
one
would
never
know
whether
the
other
was
happy
or
miserable
alive
or
dead
or
they
might
be
sold
down
south
to
work
in
the
rice
swamps
or
the
cotton
fields
it
was
this
that
the
happy
careless
slave
from
the
north
most
dreaded
it
was
just
at
this
time
when
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
being
enforced
and
the
underground
railroad
was
working
nightly
that
uncle
tom
cabin
was
written
and
published
you
all
know
the
story
of
poor
old
tom
of
funny
naughty
topsy
and
all
the
other
interesting
people
of
the
book
we
look
upon
it
now
as
merely
a
but
it
was
much
more
than
that
it
was
a
great
sermon
and
did
more
to
make
people
hate
slavery
than
any
other
book
ever
written
it
was
read
by
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
and
soon
the
fame
of
it
spread
to
every
country
in
europe
and
it
was
translated
into
at
least
twenty
languages
and
even
today
when
the
work
it
was
meant
to
do
is
done
hundreds
of
boys
and
girls
still
laugh
at
topsy
and
feel
very
choky
indeed
over
the
fate
of
poor
old
uncle
tom
chapter
pierce
the
story
of
bleeding
kansas
in
fillmore
term
of
office
came
to
an
end
and
franklin
pierce
became
president
he
was
only
and
was
the
youngest
president
who
had
been
elected
so
far
he
was
the
son
of
a
soldier
who
had
fought
in
the
mexican
war
but
by
profession
he
was
a
lawyer
and
not
a
soldier
during
the
administration
of
pierce
another
territory
was
added
to
the
united
states
this
was
a
strip
of
land
which
now
forms
the
south
of
new
mexico
and
arizona
it
was
bought
from
mexico
in
and
as
james
gadsden
arranged
the
treaty
with
the
president
of
mexico
it
was
called
the
gadsden
purchase
with
this
purchase
the
territory
of
the
united
states
as
we
know
it
today
was
completed
only
seventy
years
had
passed
since
the
peace
of
paris
but
in
these
seventy
years
the
country
had
made
mighty
strides
and
had
been
doubled
and
trebled
instead
of
being
merely
a
strip
of
land
east
of
the
mississippi
it
now
stretched
from
ocean
to
ocean
the
chief
interest
in
this
administration
was
still
the
slavery
question
it
had
not
been
settled
as
some
people
thought
it
had
been
but
it
slept
at
least
until
suddenly
a
senator
names
douglas
awoke
it
again
by
bringing
in
a
bill
to
do
away
with
the
missouri
compromise
line
there
was
still
a
great
deal
of
territory
of
the
louisiana
purchase
waiting
to
be
carved
into
states
now
said
douglas
why
make
all
this
fuss
about
slavery
or
no
slavery
every
time
a
new
state
wants
to
be
admitted
do
away
with
this
missouri
compromise
and
when
there
are
enough
people
in
a
territory
to
allow
of
its
being
admitted
as
a
state
let
these
people
themselves
decide
whether
they
wish
it
to
be
a
free
state
or
a
slave
state
the
bill
which
douglas
brought
in
thus
to
do
away
with
the
missouri
compromise
was
known
as
the
bill
as
douglas
suggested
calling
the
great
unorganised
territory
nebraska
in
the
north
and
kansas
in
the
south
douglas
was
a
northern
man
but
he
wanted
to
please
the
southerners
and
get
them
to
vote
for
him
as
president
so
he
brought
in
this
bill
it
met
the
fierce
opposition
from
the
north
but
it
passed
the
president
alone
had
power
to
stop
it
but
he
did
not
use
his
power
douglas
had
brought
in
the
bill
to
make
himself
popular
but
he
made
a
great
mistake
all
over
the
north
he
was
hated
and
cursed
because
of
it
in
town
after
town
he
was
hanged
in
effigy
and
then
burned
with
every
mark
of
scorn
he
was
reviled
as
a
judas
and
some
women
living
in
a
little
northern
village
sent
him
thirty
pieces
of
silver
in
spite
of
this
bill
the
northerners
were
determined
that
slavery
should
not
be
extended
so
even
before
the
president
had
signed
it
men
were
hurring
westward
into
kansas
claims
were
staked
out
trees
were
felled
and
huts
built
as
if
by
magic
settlers
streamed
in
by
hundreds
every
day
some
came
of
themselves
others
were
sent
by
societies
got
up
to
help
settlers
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
two
or
three
towns
were
founded
but
the
slave
holders
were
just
as
determined
to
make
kansas
a
slave
state
so
from
missouri
which
was
a
slave
state
and
bordered
upon
the
kansas
territory
thousands
of
slave
owners
came
over
the
border
and
settled
in
kansas
they
too
found
several
towns
and
there
began
a
fierce
struggle
for
the
upper
hand
march
was
appointed
by
the
governor
for
the
election
of
a
council
and
house
of
representatives
for
the
territory
the
free
staters
were
already
to
vote
in
force
but
the
election
was
a
farce
for
when
the
day
came
five
thousand
missourians
marched
across
the
border
they
were
a
wild
sunburned
picturesque
mob
they
had
guns
on
their
shoulders
revolvers
stuck
in
their
belts
and
bowie
knives
in
their
big
top
boots
they
took
possession
of
the
polling
booths
and
if
the
judges
would
not
do
as
they
wished
they
were
turned
out
do
you
live
in
kansas
asked
a
judge
yes
i
do
replied
the
missourian
without
a
moment
hesitation
does
your
family
live
in
kansas
asked
the
judge
who
knew
the
man
was
not
speaking
the
truth
it
is
none
of
your
business
replied
the
missourian
if
you
keep
your
impertinence
to
yourself
i
knock
your
head
from
your
shoulders
so
the
judge
gave
it
up
and
every
one
who
liked
voted
there
were
not
three
thousand
voters
in
the
territory
but
over
six
thousand
votes
were
recorded
of
them
being
those
unlawful
votes
of
the
missourians
thus
said
a
learned
gentleman
it
has
been
maintained
by
the
sharp
logic
of
the
revolver
and
the
bowie
knife
that
the
people
of
missouri
are
the
people
of
kansas
the
governor
of
kansas
was
named
reeder
his
sympathy
was
with
the
south
but
he
was
an
honest
man
and
when
he
saw
the
lawless
way
in
which
the
missourians
were
behaving
he
resolved
to
see
justice
done
and
although
they
threatened
to
hang
him
he
ordered
new
elections
in
the
seven
districts
which
dared
to
make
a
protest
but
the
new
elections
made
little
difference
owing
to
the
fact
that
so
many
of
the
people
were
disputing
its
result
this
election
did
not
settle
the
question
whether
kansas
were
to
be
admitted
as
a
slave
or
a
free
state
and
it
still
remained
a
territory
and
as
soon
as
the
legislature
met
the
free
state
members
were
promptly
unseated
and
the
others
had
things
all
their
own
way
the
laws
which
this
legislature
drew
up
with
regard
to
slaves
were
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
needs
and
desires
of
free
america
if
any
person
were
to
entice
a
slave
away
from
his
master
they
were
to
suffer
death
if
they
hid
and
protected
a
slave
they
might
be
imprisoned
with
hard
labour
for
five
years
or
more
and
if
any
person
declared
that
kansas
was
not
a
slave
territory
they
were
to
be
imprisoned
with
hard
labour
for
at
least
two
years
these
were
only
a
few
of
the
laws
but
the
governor
vetoed
them
all
that
is
he
refused
to
pass
them
veto
coming
from
a
latin
word
meaning
i
forbid
this
made
the
slave
party
angry
and
they
asked
the
president
to
remove
reeder
and
send
a
new
governor
this
the
president
had
power
to
do
as
texas
was
still
only
a
territory
and
not
a
state
the
president
was
now
quite
on
the
side
of
the
slave
owners
so
a
new
governor
was
sent
but
the
struggle
went
on
just
as
before
both
sides
began
to
arm
and
at
length
it
came
to
bloodshed
the
town
of
lawrence
which
was
a
free
state
town
was
sacked
by
a
mob
of
ruffians
and
civil
war
in
kansas
was
begun
in
kansas
there
was
an
old
man
named
john
brown
he
was
a
fierce
old
puritan
and
he
believed
that
god
had
called
him
to
fight
slavery
and
the
only
way
of
fighting
it
that
he
thought
possible
was
to
slay
the
a
few
days
after
the
sacking
of
lawrence
he
set
off
with
his
sons
and
one
or
two
others
to
teach
the
a
lesson
blood
had
been
spilled
by
them
and
he
was
determined
that
for
every
free
state
man
who
had
been
murdered
he
would
have
a
life
of
a
in
revenge
so
in
the
dead
of
night
he
and
his
band
attacked
the
farms
of
sleeping
men
and
dragging
them
from
their
beds
slew
them
in
cold
blood
before
day
dawned
six
or
seven
men
had
been
thus
slain
when
the
free
staters
heard
of
this
deed
they
were
shocked
but
it
roused
the
border
ruffians
to
fury
armed
companies
of
both
sides
marched
through
the
country
and
when
they
met
there
was
bloodshed
for
three
years
kansas
was
in
a
state
of
disorder
and
riot
governor
after
governor
came
with
friendly
feelings
to
the
south
but
when
they
saw
the
actions
of
the
slave
party
they
resigned
rather
than
support
such
injustice
at
length
the
slave
party
gained
their
end
but
they
were
defeated
they
were
defeated
by
douglas
that
same
man
who
had
caused
the
missouri
compromise
to
be
done
away
with
then
he
had
blackened
his
name
now
he
redeemed
it
the
president
was
ready
to
use
all
his
power
to
force
the
admission
of
kansas
as
a
slave
state
douglas
warned
him
to
beware
and
when
the
president
persisted
he
rose
in
his
place
and
made
such
a
wonderful
speech
that
the
bill
introduced
by
the
was
defeated
and
when
at
length
kansas
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
it
was
admitted
as
a
free
state
chapter
buchanan
the
story
of
the
mormons
the
president
whom
douglas
defied
over
the
question
of
kansas
was
not
pierce
for
in
his
term
of
office
came
to
an
end
and
james
buchanan
was
elected
as
president
like
pierce
he
was
a
northern
man
with
southern
principles
and
he
threw
his
lot
with
the
like
pierce
he
was
a
lawyer
and
in
ordinary
times
might
have
made
a
good
president
and
have
left
an
honoured
name
behind
him
but
he
came
into
power
at
a
most
difficult
and
dangerous
time
he
was
not
big
enough
or
strong
enough
for
the
task
and
so
his
name
is
less
honoured
perhaps
than
that
of
any
other
president
besides
kansas
two
more
states
were
admitted
into
the
union
during
buchanan
term
of
office
these
were
minnesota
in
and
oregon
in
they
both
became
states
while
the
struggle
over
kansas
was
going
on
for
in
them
there
was
no
trouble
over
the
slavery
question
and
they
were
both
admitted
as
free
states
minnesota
was
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
together
with
the
last
little
corner
of
the
territory
oregon
was
part
of
the
oregon
country
these
with
kansas
now
made
states
so
there
were
now
stars
in
the
flag
it
was
at
this
time
that
what
is
known
as
the
mormon
war
took
place
mormonism
was
a
new
religion
founded
by
joseph
smith
joseph
smith
was
a
shiftless
idle
jovial
fellow
one
of
a
large
family
as
shiftless
and
idle
as
himself
he
was
very
ignorant
but
he
had
a
wonderful
imagination
and
he
could
never
tell
the
simplest
happening
of
his
everyday
life
without
making
a
great
story
out
of
it
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
he
began
to
dream
dreams
and
see
visions
and
at
length
he
declared
that
a
messenger
from
heaven
had
shown
him
where
to
find
a
golden
book
no
one
else
saw
this
golden
book
because
smith
had
been
warned
by
the
angel
that
great
punishment
would
fall
upon
him
if
he
showed
it
to
any
one
he
was
however
allowed
to
make
a
translation
of
what
was
written
in
the
book
this
he
did
publishing
it
as
the
book
of
the
mormons
or
the
golden
bible
but
it
seems
very
likely
that
part
of
this
translation
was
really
copied
from
a
story
written
by
a
man
named
spaulding
which
had
never
been
published
a
great
deal
of
it
was
however
copied
from
the
bible
smith
who
was
at
this
time
living
in
the
state
of
new
york
now
declared
that
the
religion
which
had
been
revealed
to
him
was
the
only
true
religion
he
founded
a
church
of
which
he
was
head
or
prophet
and
under
him
were
twelve
apostles
and
other
dignitaries
a
few
people
soon
joined
him
and
gradually
their
numbers
increased
until
at
last
they
numbered
several
thousand
they
now
became
a
community
by
themselves
they
moved
about
from
place
to
place
and
at
length
settled
in
illinois
where
they
built
a
city
called
nauvoo
smith
had
many
revelations
if
he
wanted
a
horse
or
cart
he
had
a
revelation
saying
that
it
was
to
be
given
to
him
if
he
wanted
his
followers
to
do
anything
again
he
had
a
revelation
saying
it
was
to
be
done
so
he
ruled
like
an
autocrat
and
did
whatever
he
chose
and
while
at
nauvoo
he
had
a
revelation
which
said
it
was
quite
lawful
for
men
to
marry
as
many
wives
as
they
wanted
soon
the
people
of
illinois
began
to
dislike
the
saints
as
they
called
themselves
for
they
stole
horses
and
cattle
and
all
sorts
of
things
belonging
to
other
settlers
and
once
anything
was
stolen
by
the
mormons
it
was
impossible
to
get
it
back
for
if
a
stranger
went
to
their
city
and
showed
by
his
questions
that
he
had
come
to
look
for
something
he
had
lost
he
soon
found
himself
followed
by
a
mormon
who
silently
whittled
a
stick
with
a
long
sharp
knife
soon
the
man
would
be
joined
by
another
also
whittling
a
stick
with
a
long
knife
then
another
and
another
would
silently
join
the
procession
until
the
stranger
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
hastily
departed
homeward
so
as
time
went
on
the
people
grew
more
and
more
angry
with
the
mormons
and
at
length
their
anger
burst
into
fury
and
in
smith
and
one
of
his
brothers
were
lynched
by
the
mob
the
mormons
were
greatly
cast
down
at
the
death
of
their
prophet
but
they
soon
found
a
new
leader
in
brigham
young
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
but
this
change
of
leader
brought
no
peace
between
the
mormons
and
their
neighbours
complaints
of
theft
grew
more
and
more
frequent
both
sides
went
about
armed
murders
were
committed
and
the
settlers
burned
many
of
the
mormon
farms
at
length
the
whole
of
the
mormons
were
expelled
from
illinois
and
one
march
day
a
great
caravan
started
westward
slowly
day
by
day
they
moved
onward
through
unknown
wildernesses
making
a
road
for
themselves
and
building
bridges
as
they
went
and
only
after
long
trials
and
hardships
they
reached
the
great
salt
lake
the
land
around
was
treeless
and
desolate
and
the
ground
so
hard
that
when
they
tried
to
plough
it
the
ploughshare
broke
yet
they
decided
to
make
their
amid
this
desolation
and
in
the
building
of
salt
lake
city
was
begun
at
the
beginning
troubles
and
trials
were
many
but
with
hard
work
and
skilful
irrigation
the
desert
disappeared
and
fertile
fields
and
fair
gardens
took
its
place
the
mormons
now
laid
claim
to
a
great
tract
of
land
and
called
it
the
state
of
deseret
and
over
this
state
brigham
young
ruled
supreme
in
however
the
united
states
organized
it
as
a
territory
and
changed
the
name
to
utah
utah
is
an
indian
word
meaning
mountain
home
of
this
territory
brigham
young
was
governor
but
other
officials
were
sent
from
washington
very
soon
there
was
trouble
between
the
mormons
and
these
officials
and
one
after
another
they
returned
to
washington
saying
that
it
was
useless
for
them
to
remain
in
utah
for
with
brigham
young
as
governor
it
was
impossible
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
that
their
lives
even
were
in
danger
but
when
there
was
talk
of
removing
young
from
the
post
of
governor
he
was
indignant
i
am
and
will
be
governor
he
said
and
no
power
can
hinder
it
until
the
lord
almighty
says
you
need
not
be
governor
any
longer
the
mormons
were
indignant
at
the
false
reports
as
they
considered
them
of
their
doings
which
were
spread
abroad
in
the
east
so
they
asked
the
president
to
send
one
or
two
visitors
to
look
about
them
and
see
what
they
can
see
and
return
and
report
but
instead
of
sending
visitors
president
buchanan
appointed
a
new
governor
and
sent
a
body
of
troops
to
utah
thus
began
what
is
called
the
mormon
war
but
there
was
never
a
battle
fought
although
at
first
the
mormons
prepared
to
resist
they
changed
their
minds
and
the
government
troops
marched
into
salt
lake
city
without
resistance
they
found
the
city
deserted
as
nearly
all
the
inhabitants
had
fled
away
they
soon
returned
however
and
peace
was
restored
but
the
submission
was
only
one
in
form
and
for
many
a
long
day
there
was
trouble
between
the
government
and
the
territory
of
utah
besides
the
main
body
of
mormons
who
founded
salt
lake
city
there
is
another
band
followers
of
joseph
smith
eldest
son
also
called
joseph
they
broke
away
from
the
first
mormons
because
they
did
not
think
it
right
to
marry
more
than
one
wife
nor
could
they
believe
in
all
that
the
prophet
taught
his
followers
their
chief
city
is
lamoni
in
iowa
where
they
live
quiet
industrious
lives
and
are
greatly
respected
by
their
neighbours
this
religion
founded
so
strangely
has
spread
very
rapidly
in
the
church
had
only
six
members
today
there
are
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
mormons
in
the
world
most
of
whom
are
in
the
united
states
chapter
buchanan
the
first
shots
meanwhile
a
great
man
was
coming
into
power
this
was
abraham
lincoln
he
was
the
son
of
very
poor
people
and
his
earliest
days
were
spent
in
the
utmost
poverty
and
want
his
home
in
kentucky
was
a
wretched
little
log
cabin
without
doors
or
windows
and
the
bare
earth
for
a
floor
but
in
spite
of
his
miserable
and
narrow
surroundings
lincoln
grew
up
to
be
a
great
loveable
man
he
was
very
anxious
to
learn
and
he
taught
himself
nearly
all
he
knew
for
in
all
his
life
he
had
only
two
or
three
months
of
school
the
few
books
he
could
lay
hands
on
he
read
again
and
again
till
he
almost
knew
them
by
heart
lincoln
grew
to
be
a
great
lanky
hulking
boy
he
had
the
strongest
arm
and
the
tenderest
heart
in
the
countryside
and
was
so
upright
in
all
his
dealings
that
he
earned
the
name
of
honest
abe
everybody
loved
the
ungainly
young
giant
with
his
sad
face
and
lovely
smile
and
stock
of
funny
stories
he
began
early
to
earn
his
living
and
was
many
things
in
turn
he
did
all
sorts
of
farm
work
he
split
rails
and
felled
trees
he
was
a
storekeeper
for
a
time
then
a
postmaster
a
surveyor
a
soldier
but
none
of
these
contented
him
he
was
always
struggling
towards
something
better
while
keeping
shop
he
began
to
study
law
and
when
he
was
not
weighing
out
pounds
of
tea
and
sugar
he
had
his
head
deep
in
some
dry
book
while
trying
his
hand
at
other
jobs
too
he
still
went
on
studying
law
and
at
length
he
became
a
lawyer
even
before
this
he
had
taken
great
interest
in
politics
and
had
sat
in
the
illinois
house
of
representatives
and
at
length
in
he
was
elected
to
congress
but
he
only
served
one
term
in
the
house
after
which
he
returned
to
his
law
business
and
seemed
for
a
time
to
lose
interest
in
politics
but
the
passing
of
the
bill
aroused
him
again
as
a
boy
he
had
been
to
new
orleans
there
he
had
seen
the
slave
market
he
had
seen
negro
parents
parted
from
their
children
and
sold
to
different
masters
he
had
seen
them
chained
like
criminals
beaten
and
treated
worse
than
beasts
of
burden
and
from
these
sights
he
had
turned
away
with
an
aching
heart
boys
he
said
to
his
companions
let
get
away
from
this
if
ever
i
get
a
chance
to
hit
that
thing
i
hit
it
hard
and
he
did
not
forget
what
he
had
seen
the
memory
of
it
was
a
constant
torment
and
a
misery
to
him
and
now
the
chance
had
come
and
he
hit
that
thing
hard
in
he
challenged
douglas
the
author
of
the
bill
to
go
round
the
country
with
him
and
make
speeches
on
the
great
subject
of
the
day
douglas
to
take
one
side
of
the
question
and
lincoln
the
other
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
for
douglas
was
considered
the
greatest
speaker
of
the
time
and
lincoln
was
scarcely
known
but
the
speeches
made
lincoln
famous
and
henceforth
many
of
the
men
in
the
north
looked
upon
him
as
their
leader
he
wanted
to
have
slavery
done
away
with
but
above
all
he
loved
his
country
a
house
divided
against
itself
he
said
can
not
stand
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
i
do
not
expect
the
union
to
be
divided
i
do
not
expect
the
house
to
fall
but
i
do
expect
it
will
cease
to
be
divided
it
will
become
all
one
thing
or
all
the
other
he
had
no
bitterness
against
the
south
for
he
loved
his
whole
country
south
as
well
as
north
it
was
slavery
he
hated
not
the
but
the
hated
him
and
his
ideas
so
when
in
november
lincoln
was
chosen
president
the
southern
states
declared
that
they
would
not
submit
to
be
ruled
by
him
as
you
know
the
new
president
is
always
chosen
some
months
before
the
end
of
the
last
president
term
lincoln
was
thus
chosen
in
november
but
did
not
actually
become
president
till
march
so
with
buchanan
still
president
several
of
the
southern
states
declared
themselves
free
from
the
union
south
carolina
led
the
rebellion
amid
great
excitement
a
new
declaration
of
independence
was
read
and
union
with
the
other
states
was
declared
to
be
at
an
end
the
example
of
south
carolina
was
soon
followed
mississippi
alabama
florida
georgia
louisiana
and
texas
all
declared
their
union
with
the
states
at
an
end
they
then
joined
together
and
calling
themselves
the
confederate
states
they
elected
a
president
drew
up
a
constitution
and
made
ready
to
seize
the
union
forts
and
arsenals
meanwhile
president
buchanan
knew
not
what
to
do
he
tried
to
steer
both
ways
at
once
he
said
the
southern
states
had
no
right
to
break
away
from
the
union
but
he
also
said
that
the
government
had
no
power
to
force
them
to
return
in
reality
however
his
heart
was
with
the
south
and
he
believed
that
the
southerners
had
just
cause
for
anger
so
the
southerners
soon
came
to
believe
that
the
president
would
let
them
go
their
own
way
some
of
the
northerners
too
thought
a
division
would
be
a
good
thing
or
at
least
that
disunion
was
better
than
war
let
the
slave
states
depart
in
peace
they
said
but
others
would
not
hear
of
that
and
were
ready
to
fight
to
the
last
if
only
the
union
might
be
preserved
the
country
was
fast
drifting
towards
war
and
soon
the
first
shot
was
fired
charleston
the
harbour
of
south
carolina
was
guarded
by
two
forts
fort
moultrie
and
fort
sumter
fort
moultrie
was
large
needing
about
seven
hundred
men
to
guard
it
properly
and
major
anderson
who
was
in
command
had
only
sixty
men
under
him
so
seeing
that
the
people
of
south
carolina
were
seizing
everything
they
could
and
finding
that
the
president
would
send
him
no
help
he
drew
off
his
little
force
to
fort
sumter
which
could
be
more
easily
defended
again
and
again
major
anderson
asked
for
more
men
and
at
length
an
ordinary
little
passenger
vessel
was
sent
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
but
when
the
little
ship
steamed
into
charleston
harbour
the
southerners
fired
upon
it
and
as
it
had
no
guns
on
board
or
any
means
of
defence
it
turned
and
sped
back
whence
it
had
come
thus
the
first
shots
in
the
civil
war
were
fired
on
chapter
lincoln
from
bull
run
to
fort
donelson
in
the
midst
of
all
this
confusion
the
new
president
took
his
seat
the
southerners
were
so
angry
that
it
was
feared
that
lincoln
would
never
be
allowed
to
become
president
at
all
but
would
be
killed
on
his
way
to
washington
yet
he
himself
felt
no
fear
and
he
journeyed
slowly
from
his
home
to
washington
stopping
at
many
places
and
making
many
speeches
on
the
way
day
by
day
however
his
friends
grew
more
and
more
anxious
again
and
again
they
begged
him
to
change
his
plans
and
go
to
washington
by
some
other
way
but
lincoln
would
not
listen
to
their
entreaties
at
length
however
they
became
so
insistent
that
he
yielded
to
them
so
instead
of
proceeding
as
he
had
intended
he
left
his
party
secretly
and
with
one
friend
turned
back
and
went
to
washington
by
a
different
route
the
telegraph
wires
were
cut
so
that
had
any
traitor
noticed
this
change
of
plan
he
could
not
tell
his
fellow
conspirators
thus
all
unknown
lincoln
stole
silently
into
the
capital
during
the
night
and
great
was
the
astonishment
both
of
friend
and
foe
when
it
was
discovered
that
he
was
there
almost
the
first
thing
lincoln
had
to
do
was
to
send
relief
to
major
anderson
at
fort
sumter
so
vessels
were
laden
with
food
and
sent
off
to
the
gallant
little
band
but
as
soon
as
the
southerners
heard
the
news
they
determined
to
take
the
fort
before
help
could
arrive
soon
a
terrible
bombardment
began
half
a
hundred
cannon
roared
against
the
fort
shells
screamed
and
fell
and
the
walls
were
quickly
shattered
the
barracks
took
fire
and
after
two
days
it
became
utterly
impossible
to
resist
longer
so
major
anderson
yielded
and
with
his
brave
company
marched
out
with
all
the
honours
of
war
war
was
now
begun
in
real
earnest
although
strange
to
say
in
spite
of
the
terrific
firing
not
a
life
had
been
lost
on
either
side
both
north
and
south
now
began
to
arm
but
when
the
president
called
for
troops
four
states
scornfully
refused
to
obey
these
were
arkansas
tennessee
north
carolina
and
virginia
and
instead
of
gathering
troops
to
help
the
government
they
joined
the
confederates
richmond
virginia
was
chosen
as
the
capital
and
jefferson
davis
was
made
president
of
the
confederacy
which
included
eleven
states
in
the
west
of
virginia
however
the
people
were
loyal
to
the
union
and
it
was
here
that
the
first
great
battles
of
the
war
were
fought
life
in
this
part
of
virginia
which
lay
beyond
the
alleghenies
was
very
different
from
life
in
eastern
virginia
western
virginia
was
not
a
land
suitable
for
slaves
and
for
a
long
time
the
people
had
desired
to
part
from
eastern
virginia
now
during
the
war
they
had
their
wish
and
west
virginia
became
a
separate
state
in
june
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
the
state
the
war
which
had
now
begun
was
the
most
terrible
ever
fought
on
american
soil
for
far
more
even
than
the
war
of
independence
it
was
a
war
of
kindred
it
made
enemies
of
comrades
and
brothers
men
who
had
been
dear
friends
suddenly
found
themselves
changed
into
ruthless
enemies
families
even
were
divided
against
each
other
for
four
years
this
bitter
war
lasted
and
counting
all
battles
great
and
small
there
were
at
least
two
thousand
so
we
can
not
attempt
to
follow
the
whole
course
of
the
great
struggle
the
first
blood
was
shed
strangely
enough
on
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
lexington
on
that
day
april
some
massachusetts
soldiers
were
passing
through
baltimore
when
they
were
attacked
by
the
mob
pistols
were
fired
from
the
houses
paving
stones
and
bricks
flew
about
several
of
the
soldiers
were
killed
many
more
were
wounded
and
to
protect
themselves
they
fired
on
the
mob
several
of
whom
were
killed
also
the
greatest
leader
on
the
federal
side
was
general
ulysses
grant
and
next
to
him
came
william
sherman
and
philip
sheridan
but
it
was
not
until
the
war
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
that
these
soldiers
came
to
the
front
and
at
first
all
the
fortune
was
on
the
side
of
the
south
general
albert
johnston
was
of
the
southern
army
by
the
two
most
famous
southern
leaders
were
robert
lee
and
thomas
jackson
jackson
is
best
known
by
the
nickname
of
stonewall
which
he
received
at
bull
run
in
west
virginia
the
first
great
battle
of
the
war
it
seemed
as
if
the
federals
were
winning
the
battle
and
some
of
the
confederates
were
driven
backward
but
jackson
and
his
men
stood
solid
see
cried
a
general
there
is
jackson
standing
like
a
stone
wall
thus
jackson
got
a
new
name
and
the
confederates
won
the
day
it
was
one
of
the
best
planned
battles
of
the
war
said
sherman
afterwards
but
one
of
the
worst
fought
both
armies
were
fairly
defeated
and
whichever
stood
fast
the
other
would
have
run
less
than
three
weeks
after
bull
run
the
federals
met
with
another
disaster
at
wilson
creek
in
missouri
here
after
a
desperate
and
gallant
fight
they
were
defeated
and
general
nathaniel
lyon
their
brave
leader
was
killed
these
defeats
were
a
great
shock
to
the
federals
for
they
had
thought
that
the
war
would
be
a
short
affair
of
three
months
or
so
and
that
the
southern
revolt
would
be
easily
put
down
now
they
knew
themselves
mistaken
and
pulling
themselves
together
prepared
for
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
for
some
months
however
after
bull
run
and
wilson
creek
no
battle
of
importance
was
fought
then
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
was
carried
into
kentucky
where
a
stern
fight
for
the
great
navigable
rivers
which
flow
through
the
state
began
for
just
as
in
the
war
of
independence
the
holding
of
the
hudson
valley
had
been
of
importance
so
now
the
holding
of
the
mississippi
valley
was
of
importance
if
the
mississippi
from
cairo
to
new
orleans
could
be
strongly
held
by
the
federals
the
confederacy
would
be
cut
in
two
and
thus
greatly
weakened
the
mississippi
said
lincoln
is
the
backbone
of
the
rebellion
it
is
the
key
of
the
whole
situation
but
to
get
possession
of
this
key
was
no
easy
matter
early
in
february
two
forts
on
the
river
tennessee
were
taken
by
the
federals
under
general
grant
then
they
marched
upon
fort
donelson
a
large
and
very
strong
fort
on
the
cumberland
river
at
the
same
time
commander
andrew
foote
sailed
up
the
river
with
a
little
fleet
of
seven
gunboats
to
assist
the
army
the
weather
was
bitterly
cold
and
as
the
soldiers
lay
round
the
fort
tentless
and
fireless
a
pitiless
wind
blew
chilling
them
to
the
bone
and
making
sleep
impossible
foote
with
his
gunboats
had
not
yet
arrived
but
in
the
morning
the
attack
on
land
was
begun
up
the
hill
to
the
fort
the
federals
swept
only
to
be
driven
back
by
the
fierce
confederate
fire
again
and
again
they
charged
again
and
again
they
were
driven
back
leaving
the
hillside
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
at
length
the
dry
leaves
which
covered
the
hillside
took
fire
choked
by
the
smoke
scorched
by
the
flames
the
men
could
advance
no
more
and
they
sullenly
retreated
for
the
last
time
the
attack
had
failed
that
night
the
gunboats
arrived
and
soon
the
bombardment
from
the
river
began
but
the
firing
from
the
fort
was
so
fierce
and
well
placed
that
before
long
two
of
the
boats
were
disabled
and
floated
helplessly
down
the
stream
and
the
others
too
withdrew
till
they
were
out
of
range
of
the
confederate
guns
there
was
joy
that
night
in
fort
donelson
by
land
and
water
the
federals
had
been
repulsed
the
confederates
felt
certain
of
victory
but
the
federals
were
by
no
means
beaten
and
next
morning
they
renewed
the
fight
as
fiercely
as
ever
yet
again
the
confederates
swept
all
before
them
and
the
right
wing
of
the
federal
army
was
driven
from
its
position
and
scattered
in
flight
victory
for
the
confederates
seemed
certain
during
this
fight
grant
had
not
been
with
the
troops
for
he
had
gone
down
the
river
to
consult
with
foote
who
had
been
wounded
the
day
before
about
noon
he
returned
and
when
he
heard
of
the
disaster
his
face
flushed
hotly
but
he
was
a
man
who
rarely
lost
his
temper
or
betrayed
his
feelings
for
a
minute
he
was
silent
crushing
some
papers
he
held
in
his
hand
then
in
his
usual
calm
voice
he
said
gentlemen
the
position
on
the
right
must
be
retaken
and
retaken
it
was
general
charles
smith
led
the
assault
he
was
an
old
soldier
who
had
fought
under
zachary
taylor
in
texas
where
smith
light
battalion
had
become
famous
white
haired
now
but
still
handsome
and
erect
he
rode
this
day
in
front
of
his
troops
once
and
again
turning
his
head
to
cheer
them
onward
bullets
whizzed
and
screamed
about
him
but
he
heeded
them
not
i
was
nearly
scared
to
death
said
one
of
his
men
afterwards
but
i
saw
the
old
man
white
moustache
over
his
shoulder
and
went
on
hotter
and
hotter
grew
the
fire
and
the
men
hesitated
and
wavered
but
the
old
general
knew
no
fear
placing
his
cap
on
the
end
of
his
sword
he
waved
it
aloft
no
flinching
now
my
lads
he
cried
this
is
the
way
come
on
and
on
they
came
inspired
by
the
fearless
valour
of
the
old
soldier
and
when
at
length
they
had
triumphantly
planted
their
colours
on
the
lost
position
no
efforts
of
the
enemy
could
dislodge
them
meanwhile
another
division
under
general
lew
wallace
dashed
up
another
hill
with
splendid
elan
and
when
night
fell
although
the
fort
was
still
untaken
it
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
attackers
supperless
and
fireless
the
federals
cheerfully
bivouacked
upon
the
field
for
they
well
knew
that
the
morrow
would
bring
them
victory
but
within
the
fort
there
was
gloom
nothing
was
left
but
surrender
it
would
be
impossible
to
hold
out
even
for
half
an
hour
said
general
buckner
the
best
soldier
although
the
youngest
of
the
three
generals
in
command
the
other
two
generals
agreed
but
declared
that
they
would
not
stay
to
be
made
prisoner
so
in
the
night
they
silently
crept
away
with
their
men
early
next
morning
general
buckner
left
alone
in
command
wrote
to
grant
proposing
a
truce
in
order
to
arrange
terms
of
surrender
grant
answer
was
short
and
sharp
no
terms
except
unconditional
and
immediate
surrender
can
be
accepted
he
said
bitter
indeed
were
the
feelings
of
the
confederate
leader
when
he
received
this
reply
but
there
was
nothing
left
to
him
but
to
accept
the
terms
he
was
hopelessly
outnumbered
and
to
fight
longer
would
only
mean
the
throwing
away
of
brave
lives
uselessly
so
he
accepted
what
seemed
to
him
the
ungenerous
and
unchivalrous
terms
which
grant
proposed
and
surrendered
the
fort
with
all
its
guns
and
great
stores
of
ammunition
and
fourteen
thousand
men
up
to
this
time
grand
had
hardly
been
heard
of
he
was
a
soldier
indeed
and
had
fought
in
the
mexican
war
but
eight
years
before
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
he
had
left
the
army
during
these
years
he
had
tried
in
many
ways
to
make
a
living
but
had
succeeded
in
none
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
was
almost
a
ruined
man
now
he
became
famous
and
his
short
and
sharp
unconditional
surrender
was
soon
a
watchword
in
the
northern
army
his
initials
too
being
he
became
henceforth
known
as
unconditional
surrender
grant
chapter
lincoln
the
story
of
the
first
battle
between
ironclads
there
was
fighting
too
on
sea
as
well
as
on
land
the
south
sent
out
privateers
to
catch
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
north
and
so
bring
ruin
on
their
trade
but
lincoln
replied
by
proclaiming
a
blockade
of
all
confederate
ports
this
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
for
the
coast
to
be
watched
was
some
three
thousand
miles
long
and
the
government
had
less
than
fifty
ships
to
blockade
it
with
when
the
blockade
was
proclaimed
too
many
of
these
ships
were
far
away
in
foreign
lands
the
greatest
navy
yard
also
at
norfolk
in
virginia
was
in
the
hands
of
the
confederates
and
was
therefore
not
available
for
the
building
of
new
ships
so
at
first
the
blockade
amounted
to
little
but
by
degrees
it
took
effect
ships
that
had
been
far
away
returned
others
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
were
bought
still
others
were
built
with
the
utmost
speed
slowly
but
surely
the
iron
hand
of
the
north
gripped
the
commerce
of
the
south
and
before
the
end
of
the
war
the
southern
ports
were
shut
off
from
all
the
world
this
was
a
disaster
for
the
southerners
for
they
depended
almost
entirely
on
their
cotton
trade
with
europe
now
the
cotton
rotted
on
the
wharves
there
were
no
factories
in
the
south
for
manufactures
could
not
be
carried
on
with
slave
labour
so
the
southerners
depended
entirely
on
the
outside
world
for
clothes
boots
blankets
iron
and
all
sorts
of
war
material
now
they
were
cut
off
from
the
outside
world
and
could
get
none
of
these
things
but
the
southerners
did
not
meekly
submit
to
be
cut
off
from
the
world
they
had
hardly
any
ships
of
any
kind
and
none
at
all
meant
for
war
but
they
had
possession
of
the
government
navy
yard
at
norfolk
there
they
found
a
frigate
and
they
proceeded
to
finish
her
and
turn
her
into
an
ironclad
when
finished
she
was
an
ugly
looking
black
monster
with
sloping
sides
and
a
terrible
iron
beak
and
she
was
given
the
name
of
the
merrimac
at
this
time
there
were
only
about
three
ironclads
in
all
the
world
they
belonged
to
britain
and
to
france
and
had
never
yet
been
used
in
naval
warfare
so
when
this
ugly
black
monster
appeared
among
the
wooden
ships
of
the
north
she
created
frightful
havoc
it
was
one
day
in
march
that
the
black
monster
appeared
in
hampton
roads
where
there
was
a
little
fleet
of
five
federal
warships
the
federal
ships
at
once
opened
fire
upon
the
uncouth
thing
but
to
their
surprise
their
shots
fell
harmlessly
from
its
sides
and
paying
no
heed
to
their
guns
it
made
straight
for
the
cumberland
and
struck
her
such
a
terrible
blow
with
her
sharp
beak
that
she
sank
with
all
on
board
she
went
down
gallantly
flying
her
flag
to
the
last
the
merrimac
then
turned
upon
another
ship
named
the
congress
the
struggle
between
a
wooden
vessel
and
an
ironclad
was
a
hopeless
one
from
the
beginning
but
the
congress
put
up
a
splendid
fight
and
only
when
the
ship
was
afire
did
she
give
in
it
was
dusk
by
now
and
the
terrible
merrimac
sheered
off
leaving
the
congress
a
blazing
wreck
the
federals
were
filled
with
consternation
this
horrible
strange
vessel
would
certainly
return
with
daylight
and
what
chance
had
any
wooden
ship
against
it
but
help
was
near
the
government
also
had
been
busy
a
swede
named
ericsson
had
invented
a
new
vessel
which
would
resist
cannon
this
ship
was
just
finished
and
came
into
hampton
roads
almost
immediately
after
the
battle
with
the
merrimac
and
when
the
commander
heard
the
news
he
took
up
his
position
beside
the
burning
congress
and
waited
for
dawn
this
new
vessel
was
called
the
monitor
and
a
stranger
vessel
was
never
seen
afloat
its
hull
which
was
ironclad
hardly
showed
above
the
water
and
in
the
middle
there
was
a
large
round
turret
it
looked
said
those
who
saw
it
more
like
a
cheesebox
on
a
raft
than
anything
else
like
a
tiger
hungry
for
prey
the
merrimac
came
back
next
morning
the
captain
expected
an
easy
victory
but
to
his
surprise
he
found
this
queer
little
cheesebox
between
him
and
his
victims
he
would
soon
do
for
the
impertinent
little
minnow
he
thought
and
he
opened
fire
but
his
shells
might
have
been
peas
for
all
the
effect
they
had
and
the
monitor
steamed
on
unhurt
until
she
was
close
to
the
merrimac
then
she
fired
a
tremendous
duel
now
began
which
lasted
three
hours
the
lumbering
merrimac
tried
to
run
down
her
enemy
but
the
quick
little
monitor
danced
round
and
round
turning
the
turret
now
this
way
now
that
and
firing
how
she
pleased
like
a
terrier
yapping
at
a
maddened
bull
and
at
length
the
merrimac
gave
up
the
tussle
and
sailed
away
this
was
the
first
battle
ever
fought
between
ironclads
and
it
has
been
called
a
draw
but
after
all
the
honours
were
with
the
little
monitor
for
she
forced
her
big
opponent
to
run
away
it
might
almost
be
said
that
this
battle
saved
the
union
for
it
showed
the
confederates
that
they
would
not
have
it
all
their
own
way
on
sea
and
that
if
they
were
building
ironclads
the
federals
were
building
them
also
and
indeed
the
government
built
ships
so
fast
that
by
the
end
of
the
war
instead
of
having
only
about
forty
they
had
over
six
hundred
ship
many
of
them
ironclad
chapter
lincoln
the
battle
of
shiloh
and
the
taking
of
new
orleans
with
grant
other
successes
soon
followed
the
taking
of
fort
donelson
and
many
places
both
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
federals
by
the
beginning
of
april
grant
with
an
army
of
forty
thousand
men
lay
at
pittsburg
landing
on
the
tennessee
river
at
corinth
about
thirty
miles
to
the
south
the
confederates
were
gathered
in
equal
force
but
although
the
confederates
were
so
near
and
in
such
force
the
federals
took
no
heed
they
had
of
late
won
so
many
easy
victories
that
they
had
begun
to
think
lightly
of
the
foe
so
no
attempt
was
made
to
protect
the
union
army
no
trenches
were
dug
and
but
few
scouts
were
sent
out
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
enemy
the
confederate
leader
general
johnston
therefore
determined
to
creep
up
stealthily
and
attack
the
federals
where
they
lay
in
fancied
security
as
secretly
as
possible
he
left
corinth
and
marched
towards
pittsburg
landing
the
weather
had
been
wet
the
roads
were
deep
in
mud
but
in
spite
of
dreadful
difficulties
for
two
days
the
army
toiled
silently
on
at
length
on
the
night
of
saturday
the
of
april
they
arrived
within
four
miles
of
the
federal
lines
here
they
halted
for
the
night
the
men
had
brought
no
tents
they
dared
light
no
fires
lest
they
should
be
seen
by
the
foe
so
weary
wet
and
shivering
they
lay
on
the
cold
damp
ground
awaiting
the
dawn
while
secure
in
the
comfortable
shelter
of
their
tents
the
federals
slept
peacefully
so
secure
indeed
did
grant
feel
his
position
to
be
that
he
was
not
with
his
army
that
night
but
at
savannah
some
miles
distant
at
daybreak
the
federal
camp
was
astir
men
were
washing
and
dressing
some
were
cooking
or
eating
breakfast
most
of
the
officers
were
still
abed
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
shots
broke
the
sunday
stillness
and
the
wild
rebel
yell
rent
the
air
a
moment
later
the
surrounding
woods
seemed
to
open
and
pour
forth
an
army
with
tremendous
dash
the
confederates
flung
themselves
upon
the
half
dressed
weaponless
crowd
of
men
who
fled
before
them
or
were
bayoneted
before
they
could
seize
their
muskets
thus
the
greatest
battle
that
as
yet
had
been
fought
on
the
continent
of
america
was
begun
soon
the
roar
of
cannon
reached
grant
at
savannah
he
knew
at
once
that
a
fierce
battle
had
begun
and
flinging
himself
on
his
horse
he
hurried
back
to
the
camp
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
arrived
but
already
it
seemed
as
if
his
army
was
defeated
it
was
however
to
be
no
easy
victory
for
the
confederates
many
of
the
federals
were
only
raw
recruits
but
after
the
first
surprise
and
flight
they
rallied
repeatedly
making
many
a
stubborn
stand
against
the
onslaught
of
the
foe
which
from
the
first
great
charge
of
early
dawn
till
darkness
fell
never
seemed
to
slacken
in
many
coloured
uniforms
with
many
coloured
pennons
waving
over
them
the
confederates
charged
again
and
yet
again
and
with
each
charge
the
air
was
rent
with
their
wild
yell
which
could
be
heard
far
and
wide
even
above
the
roar
of
the
cannon
bit
by
bit
the
union
army
was
pressed
back
they
fought
doggedly
as
they
went
while
from
division
to
division
rode
grant
cheering
them
directing
them
urging
them
to
greater
and
ever
greater
efforts
some
of
the
fiercest
fighting
raged
round
the
little
log
meeting
house
called
shiloh
and
from
this
meeting
house
the
battle
takes
its
name
sherman
commanded
here
and
he
held
his
untried
men
together
with
marvelous
skill
handling
them
as
no
other
commander
on
the
field
could
have
done
said
grant
later
on
the
confederate
side
through
the
thickest
of
the
battle
rode
johnston
more
than
once
his
horse
was
shot
under
him
and
his
clothes
were
torn
to
pieces
but
still
through
the
fray
he
rode
unharmed
at
length
a
ball
hit
him
in
the
thigh
he
paid
no
heed
still
his
tall
soldierly
figure
dominated
the
battle
still
his
ringing
voice
cheered
on
his
men
then
suddenly
the
voice
grew
faint
the
tall
figure
bent
and
a
deathly
whiteness
overspread
his
cheeks
general
are
you
wounded
asked
one
of
his
officers
anxiously
yes
he
answered
faintly
and
i
fear
badly
they
were
his
last
words
gently
he
was
lifted
from
his
horse
and
laid
on
the
ground
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
died
when
the
sun
went
down
the
confederates
claimed
the
victory
but
if
victory
it
was
it
was
too
dearly
bought
with
the
death
of
their
nor
did
the
federals
own
themselves
beaten
they
were
dumbfounded
and
bleeding
but
not
shattered
they
felt
that
the
struggle
was
not
over
and
still
facing
each
other
the
weary
armies
lay
down
to
rest
on
the
field
under
the
lashing
rain
each
side
well
aware
that
with
the
morrow
would
come
the
decisive
contest
all
through
the
night
the
guns
from
the
river
boomed
and
crashed
and
rain
fell
in
torrents
adding
to
the
discomforts
of
the
wearied
men
making
sleep
almost
impossible
when
day
dawned
rain
still
fell
in
a
cold
and
dismal
drizzle
the
federals
however
rose
cheerfully
for
the
inspiriting
news
that
thousand
fresh
troops
had
arrived
ran
through
the
lines
before
the
sun
had
well
risen
the
battle
began
again
but
now
the
advantage
was
on
the
federal
side
the
confederates
fought
bravely
still
to
and
fro
rode
general
beauregard
cheering
on
his
men
but
step
by
step
they
were
driven
backward
and
by
noon
were
in
full
retreat
then
as
the
federals
realized
that
the
day
was
theirs
cheer
after
cheer
went
up
from
their
lines
the
second
day
fighting
had
turned
the
battle
of
shiloh
into
a
victory
for
the
union
although
not
a
decisive
one
on
the
same
day
however
the
navy
captured
a
strongly
fortified
island
on
the
mississippi
called
island
number
ten
with
its
garrison
of
seven
thousand
men
and
large
stores
of
guns
and
ammunition
this
considerably
increased
the
force
of
the
victory
of
shiloh
and
gave
the
federals
control
of
the
mississippi
valley
from
cairo
to
memphis
meanwhile
command
of
the
lower
mississippi
had
also
been
wrested
from
the
confederates
by
general
benjamin
butler
in
command
of
the
army
and
commander
david
glasgow
farragut
in
command
of
the
fleet
captain
farragut
who
was
already
at
this
time
was
a
southerner
by
birth
but
he
had
never
faltered
in
his
allegiance
to
the
union
mind
what
i
tell
you
he
said
to
his
brother
officers
when
they
tried
to
make
him
desert
his
flag
you
fellows
will
catch
the
devil
before
you
get
through
with
this
business
and
so
unshaken
was
his
faith
that
he
was
trusted
with
the
most
important
naval
expedition
of
the
war
the
taking
of
new
orleans
new
orleans
is
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
confederates
who
were
aware
even
more
than
the
federals
of
the
importance
of
the
great
waterway
had
from
the
very
beginning
done
their
utmost
to
secure
it
miles
below
new
orleans
two
forts
named
jackson
and
phillips
guarded
the
approaches
to
the
city
these
the
confederates
had
enormously
strengthened
and
had
stretched
a
great
chain
between
them
from
bank
to
bank
to
prevent
the
passage
of
hostile
ships
they
had
also
gathered
a
fleet
of
ironclads
and
gunboats
further
to
defend
the
city
but
in
spite
of
all
these
defenses
the
federals
determined
to
take
new
orleans
and
on
the
of
april
the
union
ships
began
to
bombard
the
forts
the
confederates
replied
fiercely
and
for
four
days
the
sky
seemed
ablaze
and
the
earth
shook
then
having
succeeded
in
cutting
the
chain
across
the
river
farragut
determined
to
sail
past
the
fort
and
take
new
orleans
at
two
in
the
morning
the
ships
began
to
move
the
night
was
dark
but
very
still
and
clear
and
soon
the
noise
of
slipping
anchor
cables
warned
the
enemy
of
what
was
afoot
then
a
very
hail
of
shot
and
shell
fell
upon
the
federal
boats
burning
fire
ships
too
were
sent
down
upon
them
and
the
red
light
of
battle
lit
up
the
darkness
yet
through
the
baptism
of
fire
the
vessels
held
on
their
way
undaunted
the
forts
were
passed
the
confederate
fleet
disabled
and
put
to
flight
and
farragut
sailed
unhindered
up
the
river
at
his
approach
new
orleans
was
seized
with
panic
filled
with
a
nameless
fear
women
and
children
ran
weeping
through
the
streets
business
of
every
kind
was
at
a
standstill
the
men
mostly
veterans
and
boys
turned
the
keys
in
their
office
doors
and
hurried
to
join
the
volunteer
regiments
bent
on
fighting
to
the
last
for
their
beloved
city
thousands
of
bales
of
cotton
were
carried
to
the
wharves
and
there
set
on
fire
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
ships
too
were
set
on
fire
and
cast
loose
till
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
river
front
was
wrapped
in
flames
thirty
miles
away
the
glare
could
be
seen
in
the
sky
and
at
the
sight
even
strong
men
bowed
their
heads
and
wept
for
they
knew
it
meant
that
new
orleans
had
fallen
and
that
the
queen
of
southern
cities
was
a
captive
but
there
was
no
fighting
for
general
lovell
who
was
in
command
of
the
city
marched
away
with
his
army
as
soon
as
the
union
ships
appeared
the
citizens
who
were
left
were
filled
with
impotent
wrath
and
despair
they
felt
themselves
betrayed
they
had
been
assured
that
the
city
would
fight
to
the
last
now
their
defenders
had
marched
away
leaving
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
conqueror
the
streets
were
soon
filled
with
a
dangerous
howling
cursing
mob
man
of
them
armed
all
of
them
desperate
yet
calmly
through
it
as
if
on
parade
marched
two
federal
officers
without
escort
of
protection
of
any
kind
the
mob
jostled
them
shook
loaded
pistols
in
their
faces
yelling
and
cursing
the
while
but
the
two
officers
marched
on
side
by
side
unmoved
showing
neither
anger
nor
fear
turning
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
until
they
reached
the
city
hall
where
they
demanded
the
surrender
of
the
city
it
was
one
of
the
bravest
deeds
i
ever
saw
done
said
a
southerner
who
as
a
boy
of
fourteen
watched
the
scene
by
the
taking
of
new
orleans
farragut
won
for
himself
great
fame
his
fame
was
all
the
greater
because
in
his
fleet
he
had
none
of
the
newly
invented
ironclads
with
only
wooden
vessels
he
had
fought
and
conquered
it
was
a
contest
between
iron
hearts
and
wooden
vessels
and
iron
clads
with
iron
beaks
and
the
iron
hearts
won
said
captain
bailey
who
served
in
the
expedition
under
farragut
after
taking
new
orleans
farragut
sailed
up
the
river
and
took
baton
rouge
the
state
capital
so
at
length
the
federals
had
control
of
the
whole
lower
river
as
far
as
vicksburg
the
upper
river
from
cairo
was
also
secure
to
the
federals
thus
save
for
vicksburg
the
whole
valley
was
in
their
hands
and
the
confederacy
was
practically
cut
in
two
but
vicksburg
stood
firm
for
the
south
when
called
upon
to
surrender
the
governor
refused
i
have
to
state
he
said
that
mississippians
do
not
know
and
refuse
to
learn
how
to
surrender
to
an
enemy
if
commodore
farragut
or
brigadier
general
butler
can
teach
them
let
them
come
and
try
at
the
time
soldiers
enough
could
not
be
spared
to
help
the
fleet
to
take
vicksburg
so
for
the
time
being
it
was
left
alone
chapter
lincoln
the
slaves

the
federals
rejoiced
greatly
at
the
successes
of
grant
and
the
navy
and
indeed
they
had
need
of
success
somewhere
to
keep
up
their
spirits
for
on
the
whole
things
did
not
go
well
george
mcclellan
was
and
although
he
drilled
his
army
splendidly
he
never
did
anything
with
it
he
was
a
wonderful
organiser
but
he
was
cautious
to
a
fault
and
always
believed
the
enemy
to
be
far
stronger
than
he
really
was
he
was
at
last
dismissed
and
was
succeeded
by
one
after
another
not
none
proved
truly
satisfactory
indeed
it
was
not
until
the
last
year
of
the
war
when
ulysses
grant
took
command
that
a
really
great
was
found
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
no
matter
who
was
leader
the
long
campaigns
in
virginia
ended
in
failure
for
the
federals
on
the
confederate
side
these
campaigns
were
led
first
by
joseph
johnston
and
then
by
the
great
soldier
robert
lee
lee
came
of
a
soldier
stock
being
the
youngest
son
of
light
horse
harry
lee
who
had
won
fame
during
the
war
of
the
revolution
he
was
a
noble
christian
gentleman
and
when
he
made
his
choice
and
determined
to
fight
for
the
south
he
believed
he
was
fighting
for
the
right
with
lee
was
stonewall
jackson
his
great
right
hand
and
perhaps
a
finer
soldier
than
lee
himself
his
men
adored
him
as
they
adored
no
other
leader
like
cromwell
he
taught
them
to
pray
as
well
as
to
fight
he
never
went
into
battle
without
commending
his
way
to
god
and
when
he
knelt
long
in
prayer
his
men
might
feel
certain
that
a
great
fight
was
coming
he
was
secret
and
swift
in
his
movements
so
swift
that
his
troops
were
nicknamed
jackson
foot
cavalry
yet
he
never
wore
his
men
out
he
thought
for
them
always
and
however
urgent
haste
might
be
he
called
frequent
halts
on
his
flying
marches
and
made
the
men
lie
down
even
if
it
were
only
for
a
few
minutes
to
conquer
such
leaders
and
the
men
devoted
to
them
was
no
easy
matter
and
it
was
not
wonderful
that
the
campaigns
in
virginia
marked
few
successes
for
the
federals
at
length
the
long
series
of
failures
ended
with
a
second
and
for
the
federals
disastrous
battle
of
bull
run
this
was
followed
two
days
later
by
the
battle
of
chantilly
after
which
the
whole
federal
army
fell
back
to
washington
lee
rejoicing
at
his
successes
in
virginia
made
up
his
mind
then
to
invade
maryland
which
state
he
believed
would
readily
join
the
confederacy
but
he
was
disappointed
for
if
the
marylanders
had
not
much
enthusiasm
for
the
union
cause
they
had
still
less
for
the
confederate
and
the
invaders
were
greeted
with
exceeding
coldness
their
unfailing
good
fortune
too
seemed
to
forsake
the
confederates
and
the
battle
of
antietam
one
of
the
fiercest
of
the
war
although
hardly
a
victory
for
the
federals
was
equal
to
a
defeat
for
the
confederates
for
fourteen
hours
the
carnage
lasted
and
when
at
length
night
put
an
end
to
the
slaughter
thousands
lay
dead
on
either
side
next
day
having
in
a
fortnight
lost
half
his
army
lee
withdrew
once
more
into
virginia
lincoln
chief
object
in
carrying
on
the
war
was
not
to
free
slaves
but
to
save
the
union
my
first
object
is
to
save
the
union
he
wrote
and
not
either
to
save
or
destroy
slavery
if
i
could
save
the
union
without
freeing
any
slaves
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
save
it
by
freeing
all
the
slaves
i
would
do
it
and
if
i
could
save
it
by
freeing
some
and
leaving
others
alone
i
would
also
do
that
gradually
however
lincoln
began
to
believe
that
the
only
way
to
save
the
union
was
to
free
the
slaves
many
people
were
impetuously
urging
him
to
do
it
but
lincoln
would
do
nothing
rash
it
was
a
tremendous
step
to
take
and
the
question
as
to
when
would
be
the
right
moment
to
take
it
was
for
him
one
of
tremendous
importance
so
he
prepared
his
proclamation
of
emancipation
and
bided
his
time
following
his
own
good
judgment
and
the
advice
of
one
of
his
cabinet
he
resolved
not
to
announce
it
so
long
as
things
were
going
badly
with
the
north
lest
it
should
be
looked
upon
as
the
last
measure
of
an
exhausted
government
a
cry
for
help
it
was
not
to
be
sent
forth
into
the
world
as
a
last
shriek
in
the
retreat
but
as
a
companion
to
victory
but
victory
was
slow
in
coming
at
length
the
great
battle
was
fought
at
antietam
it
was
scarce
a
victory
for
the
federals
had
lost
more
men
than
had
the
confederates
yet
it
had
to
pass
for
one
and
a
few
days
after
it
lincoln
issued
his
proclamation
of
emancipation
in
this
he
declared
that
in
every
state
which
should
be
in
arms
against
the
government
on
the
of
january
the
slaves
should
be
free
forever
more
this
gave
the
rebel
states
more
than
three
months
in
which
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
return
to
their
allegiance
meanwhile
the
war
went
on
in
november
general
ambrose
burnside
was
appointed
commander
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
he
accepted
the
post
unwillingly
for
he
did
not
think
himself
great
enough
to
fill
it
it
was
soon
proved
that
he
was
right
on
december
a
great
battle
was
fought
at
fredericksburg
in
virginia
the
weather
had
been
very
cold
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
frost
and
snow
but
on
the
morning
of
the
although
a
white
mist
shrouded
the
land
the
sun
shone
so
warmly
that
it
seemed
like
a
september
day
yet
though
the
earth
and
sky
alike
seemed
calling
men
to
mildness
and
peace
the
deadly
game
of
war
went
on
the
centre
of
the
confederate
army
occupied
some
high
ground
known
as
the
maryes
heights
and
burnside
resolved
to
dislodge
them
it
was
a
foolhardy
attempt
for
the
hill
was
strongly
held
the
summit
of
it
bristled
with
cannon
yet
the
order
was
given
and
with
unquestioning
valour
the
men
rushed
to
the
attack
as
they
dashed
onward
the
confederate
guns
swept
their
ranks
and
they
were
mowed
down
like
hay
before
the
reaper
still
they
pressed
onward
and
after
paying
a
fearful
toll
in
dead
and
wounded
they
at
length
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
here
they
were
confronted
by
a
stone
wall
so
thick
and
strong
that
their
fire
had
not
the
slightest
effect
on
it
and
from
behind
which
the
confederates
poured
a
deadly
hail
of
bullets
upon
them
here
the
carnage
was
awful
yet
still
the
men
came
on
in
wave
after
wave
only
to
melt
away
as
it
seemed
before
the
terrible
fire
of
the
confederates
it
was
like
snow
coming
down
and
melting
on
warm
ground
said
one
of
their
leaders
afterwards
never
did
men
fling
away
their
lives
so
bravely
and
so
uselessly
a
battery
was
ordered
forward
general
said
an
officer
a
battery
can
not
live
there
then
it
must
die
there
was
the
answer
and
the
battery
was
led
out
as
dashingly
as
if
on
parade
although
the
men
well
knew
that
they
were
going
to
certain
death
at
length
the
short
winter
day
drew
to
a
close
and
darkness
mercifully
put
an
end
to
the
slaughter
then
followed
a
night
of
pain
and
horror
the
frost
was
intense
and
out
on
that
terrible
hillside
the
wounded
lay
beside
the
dead
untended
and
uncared
for
many
dying
from
cold
ere
help
could
reach
them
still
and
white
they
lay
beneath
the
starry
sky
while
the
general
who
had
sent
them
to
a
needless
death
wrung
his
hands
in
cruel
remorse
oh
those
men
oh
those
men
he
moaned
those
men
over
there
i
am
thinking
of
them
all
the
time
burnside
knew
that
he
had
failed
as
a
general
and
in
his
grief
and
despair
he
determined
to
wipe
out
his
failure
by
another
attempt
next
day
but
his
officers
well
knew
that
this
would
only
mean
more
useless
sacrifice
of
life
with
difficulty
they
persuaded
him
to
give
up
the
idea
and
two
days
later
the
federal
army
crossed
the
rappahannock
and
returned
to
their
camp
near
falmouth
with
this
victory
of
fredericksburg
the
hopes
of
the
confederates
rose
high
they
believed
that
the
war
would
soon
end
triumphantly
for
them
and
that
the
south
would
henceforth
be
a
separate
republic
there
was
no
need
for
them
they
thought
to
listen
to
the
commands
of
the
president
of
the
north
and
not
one
state
paid
any
heed
to
lincoln
demand
that
the
slaves
should
be
set
free
nevertheless
on
new
year
day
lincoln
signed
the
great
proclamation
of
freedom
he
had
first
held
a
great
reception
and
had
shaken
hands
with
so
many
people
that
his
right
hand
was
trembling
if
they
find
my
hand
trembling
he
said
to
the
secretary
of
state
as
he
took
up
his
pen
they
will
say
hesitated
but
anyway
it
is
going
to
be
done
then
very
carefully
and
steadily
he
wrote
his
name
it
was
the
greatest
deed
of
his
life
if
my
name
is
ever
remembered
he
said
it
will
be
for
this
act
and
my
whole
soul
is
in
it
and
thus
slavery
came
to
an
end
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
there
had
been
a
danger
that
france
and
britain
might
help
the
south
lincoln
had
now
made
that
impossible
by
making
the
war
one
against
slavery
as
well
as
one
for
union
for
both
france
and
britain
were
against
slavery
and
could
not
well
help
those
who
now
fought
to
protect
it
now
that
they
were
free
many
negroes
entered
the
army
at
this
the
southerners
were
very
angry
and
declared
that
any
negroes
taken
prisoners
would
not
be
regarded
as
soldiers
but
simply
as
rebellious
negroes
and
would
be
punished
accordingly
but
in
spite
of
their
anger
many
black
regiments
were
formed
and
proved
themselves
good
soldiers
and
before
the
end
of
the
war
the
confederates
too
were
making
use
of
negro
soldiery
but
this
was
cutting
the
ground
from
under
their
own
feet
and
showing
the
injustice
of
slavery
for
as
a
southerner
said
if
a
negro
is
fit
to
be
a
soldier
he
is
not
fit
to
be
a
slave
chapter
lincoln
chancellorsville
the
death
of
stonewall
jackson
still
the
war
went
on
and
still
the
north
suffered
many
losses
soon
after
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
general
burnside
resigned
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
his
place
was
taken
by
general
joseph
hooker
known
to
his
men
as
fighting
joe
he
was
a
tall
and
handsome
man
brave
and
dashing
almost
to
rashness
beware
of
rashness
beware
of
rashness
said
lincoln
when
he
appointed
him
but
with
energy
and
sleepless
vigilance
go
forward
and
give
us
victories
but
not
even
fighting
joe
could
bring
victory
to
the
north
at
once
he
found
the
army
disheartened
dwindling
daily
by
desertion
and
altogether
in
something
like
confusion
he
was
however
a
splendid
organiser
and
in
less
than
two
months
he
had
pulled
the
army
together
and
once
more
made
it
a
terrible
fighting
machine
he
declared
it
to
be
the
finest
army
in
the
world
and
full
of
pride
in
his
men
and
pride
in
himself
he
set
out
to
crush
lee
near
the
tiny
hamlet
of
chancellorsville
the
two
armies
met
and
the
four
days
fighting
which
followed
is
known
as
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
everything
seemed
to
favour
the
federals
they
had
the
larger
army
they
were
encamped
in
a
good
position
and
above
all
the
men
were
full
of
admiration
for
and
trust
in
joe
general
hooker
movements
had
been
quick
and
sure
his
plans
well
laid
but
he
had
expected
the
enemy
to
flee
ingloriously
before
him
the
enemy
however
did
not
flee
but
showed
a
stubborn
intention
of
fighting
then
hooker
courage
failed
him
he
seemed
to
lose
his
grip
on
things
and
much
to
the
surprise
of
his
officers
he
left
his
high
position
and
took
a
lower
one
great
heavens
said
general
meade
when
he
heard
the
order
if
we
can
not
hold
the
top
of
a
hill
we
certainly
can
not
hold
the
bottom
of
it
the
first
day
of
the
battle
passed
without
any
great
loss
on
either
side
night
came
the
fighting
ceased
and
the
weary
men
lay
down
to
rest
but
for
lee
and
jackson
there
was
little
sleep
beneath
a
small
clump
of
pine
trees
they
sat
on
packing
cases
with
maps
spread
out
before
them
for
jackson
was
planning
one
of
his
quick
and
stealthy
marches
intent
on
catching
the
federals
unawares
where
they
least
expected
it
and
lee
seeing
the
indecision
of
the
federal
leader
was
nothing
loath
he
had
grown
bold
even
to
rashness
in
proportion
as
hooker
had
grown
cautious
what
exactly
do
you
propose
to
do
asked
lee
as
he
studied
the
map
go
around
here
replied
jackson
as
with
his
finger
he
traced
a
line
on
the
map
which
encircled
the
whole
right
wing
of
the
federal
army
with
what
force
do
you
propose
to
make
this
movement
asked
lee
with
my
whole
corps
answered
jackson
general
lee
thought
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
then
he
spoke
well
go
on
he
said
he
knew
that
it
was
a
great
gamble
the
federal
army
was
twice
as
large
as
his
own
and
yet
jackson
proposed
to
cut
it
in
two
and
place
the
whole
federal
army
between
the
two
halves
if
the
movement
failed
it
would
be
a
terrible
failure
if
it
succeeded
it
would
be
a
great
success
it
was
worth
the
risk
so
he
said
go
on
as
for
jackson
he
had
no
doubts
at
lee
words
he
rose
smiling
and
eager
my
troops
will
move
at
once
sir
he
said
and
with
a
salute
he
was
gone
soon
in
the
cool
and
lovely
may
morning
jackson
men
were
marching
through
what
was
known
as
the
wilderness
it
was
a
forest
of
smallish
trees
so
thickly
set
that
a
man
could
hardly
march
through
it
gun
on
shoulder
the
federals
saw
the
great
column
of
men
move
off
without
misgivings
imagining
them
to
be
retreating
soon
they
were
lost
to
sight
swallowed
up
by
the
wilderness
here
and
there
through
the
wood
narrow
unmade
roads
were
cut
and
along
these
hour
after
hour
thousand
men
moved
ceaselessly
and
silently
through
the
thick
foliage
there
came
to
them
faint
echoes
of
the
thundering
guns
while
close
about
them
the
cries
of
startled
birds
broke
the
stillness
and
the
timid
wild
things
of
the
woods
scurried
in
terror
before
them
as
the
day
went
on
the
heat
became
stifling
and
dust
rose
in
clouds
beneath
the
tramping
feet
still
choking
hot
and
dusty
the
men
pressed
on
the
soldiers
of
the
right
wing
of
the
federal
army
were
resting
about
six
that
evening
their
arms
were
stacked
some
were
cooking
supper
others
were
smoking
or
playing
cards
when
suddenly
from
the
woods
there
came
the
whirr
of
wings
and
a
rush
of
frightened
squirrels
and
rabbits
and
other
woodland
creatures
it
was
the
first
warning
the
federals
had
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
they
flew
to
arms
but
it
was
already
too
late
with
their
wild
yell
the
confederates
dashed
into
the
camp
the
federals
fought
bravely
but
they
were
taken
both
in
front
and
rear
and
were
utterly
overwhelmed
now
and
again
a
regiment
tried
to
make
a
stand
only
to
be
swept
away
by
the
terrific
onslaught
of
the
confederates
and
leaving
half
their
number
dead
on
the
field
they
fled
in
panic
still
with
desperate
courage
the
federal
leaders
sought
to
stem
the
onrush
of
the
enemy
and
stay
the
rout
you
must
charge
into
those
woods
and
hold
the
foe
until
i
get
some
guns
into
position
said
general
pleasonton
turning
to
major
peter
keenan
i
will
sir
replied
keenan
then
calmly
smiling
at
the
head
of
his
handful
of
men
he
rode
to
certain
death
ten
minutes
later
he
lay
dead
with
more
than
half
his
gallant
followers
beside
him
but
his
sacrifice
was
not
in
vain
for
his
desperate
thrust
had
held
the
confederates
until
the
guns
were
placed
and
the
army
saved
from
utter
rout
the
sun
went
down
on
a
brilliant
victory
for
the
confederates
yet
the
night
brought
disaster
for
them
eager
to
find
out
what
the
federals
were
doing
general
jackson
rode
out
towards
their
lines
in
the
gathering
darkness
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
for
he
ran
the
risk
of
being
picked
off
by
their
the
danger
indeed
was
so
great
that
an
officer
of
his
staff
tried
to
make
him
turn
back
general
he
said
you
think
that
this
is
the
wrong
place
for
you
but
jackson
would
not
listen
the
danger
is
all
over
he
said
carelessly
the
enemy
is
routed
go
back
and
tell
hill
to
press
right
on
soon
after
giving
this
order
jackson
himself
turned
and
rode
back
with
his
staff
at
a
quick
trot
but
in
the
dim
light
his
men
mistook
the
little
party
for
a
company
of
federals
charging
and
they
fired
many
of
his
officers
were
killed
jackson
himself
was
sorely
wounded
and
fell
from
his
horse
into
the
arms
of
one
of
his
officers
general
asked
some
one
anxiously
are
you
much
hurt
i
think
i
am
replied
jackson
and
all
my
wounds
are
from
my
own
men
he
added
sadly
as
tenderly
as
might
be
he
was
carried
to
the
rear
and
all
that
could
be
done
was
done
but
stonewall
jackson
had
fought
his
last
victorious
fight
eight
days
later
the
conqueror
of
all
men
laid
his
hand
upon
him
and
he
passed
to
the
land
of
perfect
peace
during
these
days
he
seemed
to
forget
the
great
war
his
wife
and
children
were
with
him
and
thoughts
of
them
filled
his
heart
but
at
the
end
he
was
once
more
in
imagination
with
his
men
on
the
field
of
battle
order
hill
to
prepare
for
action
he
cried
pass
the
infantry
to
the
front
tell
major
then
he
stopped
leaving
the
sentence
unfinished
a
puzzled
troubled
look
overspread
his
handsome
worn
face
but
in
a
few
minutes
it
passed
away
and
calm
peace
took
its
place
let
us
cross
over
the
river
he
said
softly
and
clearly
and
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
then
with
a
contented
sight
he
entered
into
his
rest
stonewall
jackson
was
a
true
christian
and
a
great
soldier
and
his
loss
to
the
confederate
cause
was
one
which
could
not
be
replaced
he
believed
to
the
end
that
he
was
fighting
for
the
right
and
mistaken
although
he
might
be
his
honour
and
valour
were
alike
perfect
both
north
and
south
may
unite
in
admiration
for
him
as
a
soldier
and
in
love
for

the
battle
of
gettysburg
the
day
after
jackson
was
wounded
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
continued
and
ended
in
a
second
victory
for
the
confederates
on
the
and
the
fighting
was
again
renewed
then
the
federals
retired
across
the
rappahannock
to
their
former
camping
ground
unmolested
the
confederates
being
too
exhausted
to
pursue
them
after
fredericksburg
the
confederates
had
rejoiced
after
chancellorsville
they
rejoiced
still
more
and
they
made
up
their
minds
to
carry
the
war
into
the
northern
states
so
leaving
part
of
his
army
under
general
stuart
to
prevent
the
federals
pursuing
him
lee
marched
into
pennsylvania
but
general
stuart
was
unable
to
hold
the
federals
back
and
they
were
soon
in
pursuit
of
lee
at
chancellorsville
hooker
had
shown
that
although
he
was
a
splendid
fighting
general
he
was
a
poor
and
towards
the
end
of
june
while
the
army
was
in
full
cry
after
the
foe
general
george
gordon
meade
was
made
meade
continued
the
pursuit
and
lee
seeing
nothing
for
it
gave
up
his
plans
of
invasion
and
turned
to
meet
the
foe
the
two
forces
met
near
the
little
town
of
gettysburg
in
pennsylvania
and
a
great
battle
took
place
the
fighting
began
on
the
first
of
july
when
the
federal
army
was
still
widely
scattered
through
the
country
and
meade
himself
far
in
the
rear
and
again
the
confederates
triumphed
late
that
night
general
meade
arrived
upon
the
field
and
began
to
make
preparations
for
the
struggle
on
the
morrow
on
both
sides
the
commanders
and
armies
seemed
to
feel
that
a
great
turning
point
of
the
war
had
come
and
they
bent
all
their
energies
on
winning
both
camps
were
early
astir
yet
each
side
seemed
to
hesitate
to
begin
the
fearful
game
and
put
fortune
to
the
test
so
the
morning
passed
quietly
the
hot
silence
of
the
summer
day
being
broken
only
now
and
again
by
fitful
spurts
of
firing
late
in
the
afternoon
at
length
the
confederates
attacked
and
soon
the
battle
raged
fiercely
the
fight
swung
this
way
and
that
first
the
one
side
and
then
the
other
gaining
ground
here
losing
it
there
when
night
came
the
position
was
little
changed
the
advantage
still
lay
with
the
confederates
next
day
there
was
no
hesitation
both
sides
knew
that
the
deadly
duel
must
be
fought
to
the
close
and
at
dawn
the
roll
and
thud
of
cannon
began
from
hill
to
hill
gun
answered
gun
shells
screamed
and
hissed
and
the
whole
valley
seemed
to
be
encircled
with
flame
and
smoke
but
the
confederates
gained
nothing
the
federals
stood
firm
at
length
lee
determined
to
make
a
mighty
effort
to
smash
the
center
of
the
federal
line
and
split
it
in
two
collecting
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
guns
he
massed
them
along
a
height
named
seminary
ridge
and
with
these
he
pounded
the
federals
on
cemetery
hill
opposite
for
two
hours
the
terrible
cannonade
lasted
at
first
the
federal
guns
replied
vigorously
then
they
almost
ceased
they
ceased
not
because
they
had
been
put
out
of
action
not
because
ammunition
was
running
short
but
because
meade
was
reserving
his
strength
for
the
infantry
attack
he
knew
must
come
in
the
confederate
camp
there
was
strained
anxiety
lee
had
determined
to
make
the
attack
but
general
longstreet
was
against
it
he
did
not
believe
that
it
could
succeed
it
was
he
felt
sure
only
the
useless
throwing
away
of
brave
lives
and
his
heart
was
wrung
with
sorrow
at
the
thought
but
lee
insisted
and
general
george
pickett
division
was
chosen
to
make
the
attempt
so
longstreet
gave
way
but
when
pickett
came
to
him
for
last
orders
he
could
not
speak
he
merely
nodded
his
head
and
turned
away
with
a
sob
pickett
however
knew
neither
hesitation
nor
fear
sir
he
said
firmly
i
shall
lead
my
division
forward
again
longstreet
gave
a
sign
and
pickett
gallant
and
gay
rode
off
into
the
jaws
of
death
erect
and
smiling
his
cap
set
rakishly
over
one
ear
his
hair
shining
in
the
sun
he
seemed
said
longstreet
long
after
more
like
a
holiday
soldier
than
a
general
about
to
lead
a
desperate
and
almost
hopeless
attack
the
federal
lines
were
a
mile
away
towards
them
towards
the
bristling
row
of
guns
the
men
marched
steadily
keeping
step
as
if
on
parade
their
banners
fluttering
gaily
and
their
bayonets
glittering
in
the
sunshine
confident
and
elated
they
swept
on
they
were
out
to
win
not
merely
the
battle
but
the
war
and
they
meant
to
do
it
half
the
distance
was
covered
then
the
federal
guns
spoke
crashing
and
thundering
they
tore
great
gaps
in
the
approaching
column
still
the
men
moved
on
steadily
resistlessly
until
they
came
within
musket
range
then
on
a
sudden
the
whole
federal
line
became
as
it
were
a
sheet
of
flame
and
smoke
and
the
first
line
of
the
advancing
confederates
seemed
to
crumble
away
before
the
fearful
fusilade
but
the
second
line
came
on
only
faster
and
yet
faster
firing
volley
after
volley
scattering
frightful
death
as
they
came
nothing
could
stay
their
impetuous
charge
on
they
came
right
up
to
the
rifle
pits
in
a
rush
they
were
across
them
and
over
the
barricades
then
with
a
yell
of
victory
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
guns
bayoneting
the
gunners
leaping
upon
the
barricade
a
man
held
aloft
the
confederate
flag
waving
it
in
triumphant
joy
the
next
instant
he
fell
mortally
wounded
and
the
flag
bloodstained
and
torn
was
trampled
under
foot
the
confederate
success
was
only
the
success
of
a
moment
the
handful
of
heroic
men
who
had
reached
the
federal
guns
could
not
hope
to
hold
them
they
died
gallantly
that
was
all
a
storm
of
shot
and
shell
tore
its
way
through
the
still
advancing
ranks
it
became
an
ordeal
of
fire
too
great
for
even
the
bravest
to
face
the
lines
at
length
wavered
they
broke
and
the
men
were
scattered
in
flight
thousands
lay
dead
and
dying
on
the
field
many
surrendered
and
were
taken
prisoner
and
of
the
fifteen
thousand
gallant
soldiers
who
had
set
forth
so
gaily
only
a
pitiful
remnant
of
thirteen
hundred
weary
men
at
length
reached
their
own
lines
this
gallant
and
hopeless
charge
brought
the
battle
of
gettysburg
to
an
end
it
brought
victory
to
the
federal
side
and
the
confederates
slowly
retired
into
virginia
once
more
yet
the
victory
was
not
very
great
nor
in
any
way
decisive
and
the
cost
of
life
had
been
frightful
indeed
so
many
brave
men
had
fallen
upon
this
dreadful
field
that
the
thought
came
to
the
governor
of
the
state
that
it
would
be
well
to
make
a
portion
of
it
into
a
soldiers
burial
place
and
thus
consecrate
it
forever
as
holy
ground
all
the
states
whose
sons
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
willingly
helped
and
a
few
months
after
the
battle
it
was
dedicated
and
there
president
lincoln
made
one
of
his
most
beautiful
and
famous
speeches
fourscore
and
seven
years
ago
he
said
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battlefield
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hollow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
from
these
honoured
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
chapter
ride
the
victory
of
gettysburg
which
had
been
so
dearly
bought
was
not
very
great
but
hard
upon
it
came
the
news
that
on
the
of
july
vicksburg
had
surrendered
to
general
grant
and
taking
both
victories
together
the
people
of
the
north
felt
that
now
they
had
cause
to
hope
after
the
capture
of
new
orleans
in
april
faragut
had
sailed
up
the
mississippi
and
except
for
vicksburg
the
whole
valley
was
in
the
control
of
the
federals
faragut
would
have
attacked
vicksburg
also
but
his
land
force
was
not
strong
enough
and
halleck
who
was
then
did
not
see
the
great
importance
of
vicksburg
and
refused
to
send
soldiers
to
aid
him
the
confederates
however
knew
the
importance
of
holding
the
city
for
it
was
the
connecting
link
between
the
revolted
states
which
lay
east
and
those
which
lay
west
of
the
great
river
through
it
passed
enormous
supplies
of
food
from
the
west
and
great
quantities
also
of
arms
and
ammunition
and
other
war
stores
which
came
from
europe
by
way
of
mexico
so
while
the
federals
neglected
to
take
vicksburg
the
confederates
improved
its
fortifications
until
they
were
so
strong
that
it
seemed
almost
impossible
that
it
should
ever
be
taken
at
length
grant
was
given
supreme
command
of
the
western
army
and
he
well
knowing
the
importance
of
vicksburg
became
intent
on
taking
it
again
and
yet
again
he
tried
and
failed
indeed
he
failed
so
often
that
people
began
to
clamour
for
his
recall
but
president
lincoln
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
clamour
and
decided
always
to
try
him
a
little
longer
and
still
a
little
longer
and
grant
justified
his
trust
finding
it
impossible
to
take
vicksburg
by
assault
he
determined
to
besiege
it
in
a
brilliant
campaign
of
less
than
a
fortnight
he
marched
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
fought
four
battles
then
he
sat
down
with
his
victorious
army
before
vicksburg
and
a
regular
siege
began
vicksburg
was
now
completely
surrounded
on
the
river
the
fleet
kept
watch
so
that
no
boats
carrying
food
ammunition
or
relief
of
any
kind
could
reach
the
fated
city
on
land
grant
army
dug
itself
in
daily
bringing
the
ring
of
trenches
closer
and
closer
to
the
confederate
fortifications
they
were
so
close
at
last
that
the
soldiers
on
either
side
could
hear
each
other
talking
and
often
friendly
chat
passed
between
the
yanks
and
the
johnnies
or
southerners
when
are
you
coming
into
town
yank
the
confederates
would
ask
well
johnnie
we
are
thinking
of
celebrating
the
of
july
there
the
northerners
would
reply
and
at
this
the
johnnies
would
laugh
as
at
a
huge
joke
no
of
july
would
the
yanks
celebrate
in
their
city
regularly
too
the
confederates
would
pass
over
the
little
vicksburg
paper
the
daily
citizen
to
their
enemies
this
paper
appeared
daily
to
the
last
although
paper
grew
so
scarce
that
it
sometimes
consisted
only
of
one
sheet
eighteen
inches
long
and
six
inches
wide
at
length
printing
paper
gave
out
altogether
and
the
journal
appeared
printed
on
the
plain
side
of
wall
paper
day
was
added
to
day
and
week
to
week
and
still
the
siege
of
vicksburg
lasted
all
day
cannon
roared
shells
screamed
and
whistled
and
the
city
seemed
enveloped
in
flame
and
noise
the
streets
were
places
of
death
and
danger
and
the
people
took
refuge
in
the
cellars
of
the
houses
or
in
caves
which
they
dug
out
of
the
clayey
soil
in
these
caves
whole
families
lived
for
weeks
together
only
creeping
out
to
breathe
the
air
during
the
short
intervals
night
and
morning
when
the
guns
ceased
firing
food
grew
scarcer
and
scarcer
until
at
length
there
was
nothing
left
but
salt
bacon
the
flesh
of
mules
rats
and
mouldy
pea
flour
the
soldiers
became
no
longer
fit
to
man
the
guns
their
rations
being
no
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
bacon
and
the
same
of
flour
each
day
water
too
ran
short
and
they
were
obliged
to
drink
the
muddy
water
of
the
mississippi
like
pale
specters
the
people
crept
about
and
many
both
soldiers
and
citizens
died
from
starvation
and
disease
brought
on
by
starvation
at
length
vicksburg
seemed
little
more
than
one
great
hospital
encircled
by
fire
made
hideous
by
noise
human
nature
could
endure
no
longer
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
white
flags
appeared
upon
the
ramparts
immediately
the
roar
of
cannon
ceased
and
silence
fell
on
city
and
camp
after
the
six
weeks
inferno
it
seemed
to
the
racked
nerves
and
aching
ears
of
the
inhabitants
as
if
the
silence
might
be
felt
as
if
the
peace
wrapped
them
about
like
a
soft
robe
the
relief
was
so
great
that
many
who
had
endured
the
weeks
of
torture
now
burst
into
tears
but
they
were
healing
tears
under
a
lonely
tree
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
the
confederate
lines
grant
met
general
john
pemberton
the
defender
of
vicksburg
the
two
men
had
fought
side
by
side
in
the
mexican
war
and
had
been
friends
now
although
divided
by
cruel
strife
they
shook
hand
as
of
old
but
memories
of
bygone
days
did
not
soften
grant
heart
his
terms
were
hard
once
more
he
demanded
unconditional
surrender
and
pemberton
knowing
that
resistance
was
impossible
yielded
next
day
the
surrender
was
accomplished
and
thirty
thousand
men
became
prisoners
of
war
before
noon
the
union
flag
was
flying
over
the
court
house
thus
the
yanks
celebrated
the
glorious
fourth
in
vicksburg
as
they
had
said
they
would
do
but
there
was
no
noisy
rejoicing
the
federals
took
possession
almost
in
silence
for
they
had
too
much
admiration
for
their
gallant
foe
to
wish
to
give
them
pain
one
cheer
indeed
rent
the
air
but
it
was
given
for
the
glorious
defenders
of
vicksburg
the
whole
north
was
now
united
in
passionate
admiration
for
grant
cheering
crowds
followed
him
in
the
streets
fools
and
wise
men
alike
were
eager
to
know
him
to
boast
that
they
had
spoken
to
him
or
touched
his
hand
yet
at
first
sight
grant
seemed
to
have
little
of
the
hero
about
him
he
was
an
ordinary
scrubby
looking
man
with
a
slightly
seedy
look
said
one
who
saw
him
in
those
days
he
did
not
march
nor
quite
walk
but
pitched
along
as
if
the
next
step
would
bring
him
to
his
nose
but
his
eye
was
clear
and
blue
he
had
a
determined
look
and
seemed
like
a
man
it
would
be
bad
to
trifle
with
this
shambling
scrubby
looking
man
with
the
clear
blue
eyes
was
now
the
idol
of
the
people
lincoln
too
saw
his
genius
as
a
leader
and
willingly
yielding
to
the
popular
demand
made
him
of
all
the
united
states
armies
before
long
grant
had
made
his
plans
for
the
next
campaign
it
was
a
twofold
one
he
himself
with
one
army
determined
by
blow
after
blow
to
hammer
lee
into
submission
while
sherman
was
to
tackle
the
other
great
confederate
army
under
johnston
in
the
beginning
of
may
grant
set
out
and
on
the
and
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
was
fought
not
far
from
where
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
had
been
fought
the
year
before
grant
had
not
meant
to
fight
here
but
lee
who
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
forced
the
fight
on
him
in
the
tangled
underwood
of
the
wilderness
artillery
and
cavalry
were
of
little
use
and
the
battle
became
a
fierce
struggle
between
the
foot
soldiers
of
either
army
the
forest
was
so
thick
that
officers
could
only
see
a
small
part
of
their
men
and
could
only
guess
at
what
was
going
on
by
the
sound
of
the
firing
and
the
shouts
exultant
or
despairing
of
the
men
who
were
drive
to
and
fro
in
the
dark
and
dreary
thickets
in
the
end
neither
side
gained
anything
except
an
increased
respect
for
the
foe
grant
aim
was
to
take
richmond
the
confederate
capital
and
after
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
with
that
aim
still
before
him
he
moved
his
army
to
spotsylvania
he
was
hotly
pursued
by
lee
and
here
on
the
and
of
may
another
stern
struggle
took
place
the
fighting
on
the
was
so
terrible
that
on
the
both
armies
rested
as
by
common
consent
next
day
the
battle
began
again
and
lasted
until
midnight
it
was
a
struggle
the
tide
of
victory
swung
this
way
and
that
positions
were
taken
and
lost
and
taken
again
and
after
hours
of
fighting
neither
side
had
won
only
thousands
of
brave
men
lay
dead
upon
the
field
still
intent
on
richmond
grant
moved
southwards
after
this
terrible
battle
followed
closely
by
lee
everyday
almost
there
were
skirmishes
between
the
two
armies
but
still
grant
pressed
onward
and
arrived
at
length
within
a
few
miles
of
richmond
here
at
cold
harbor
lee
took
up
a
strongly
entrenched
position
from
which
it
seemed
impossible
to
oust
him
except
by
a
grand
assault
grant
determined
to
make
that
assault
both
officers
and
men
knew
that
it
could
not
succeed
but
grant
commanded
it
and
they
obeyed
yet
so
sure
were
many
of
the
men
that
they
were
going
to
certain
death
that
it
is
said
they
wrote
their
names
and
addresses
on
slips
of
paper
which
they
tacked
to
the
backs
of
their
coats
so
that
when
their
bodies
were
found
it
might
be
easily
known
who
they
were
and
news
be
sent
to
their
friends
at
four
in
the
grey
morning
light
eighty
thousand
men
rushed
upon
the
foe
they
were
met
with
a
blinding
fire
and
swept
away
in
half
an
hour
the
attack
was
over
it
was
the
deadliest
half
hour
in
all
american
history
and
eight
thousand
union
men
lay
dead
upon
the
field
some
one
had
blundered
grant
had
blundered
he
knew
it
and
all
his
life
after
regretted
it
no
advantage
whatever
was
gained
he
said
to
make
up
for
the
heavy
loss
we
suffered
in
this
terrible
campaign
he
had
lost
sixty
thousand
men
he
had
not
taken
richmond
he
had
neither
destroyed
nor
dispersed
army
still
he
hammered
on
hoping
in
the
long
run
to
wear
out
lee
for
the
confederates
had
lost
heavily
too
and
they
had
no
more
men
with
which
to
make
good
their
losses
on
the
other
hand
the
gaps
in
the
federal
army
were
filled
up
almost
as
soon
as
made
it
no
use
killing
these
fellows
said
the
confederates
a
half
dozen
take
the
place
of
every
one
we
kill
but
the
people
of
the
north
could
not
look
on
calmly
at
these
terrible
doings
they
cast
their
idol
down
and
cried
out
against
grant
as
a
butcher
they
demanded
his
removal
but
lincoln
refused
again
to
listen
to
the
clamour
as
he
had
refused
before
i
can
not
spare
that
man
he
said
at
least
he
fights
grant
was
terrible
only
for
a
good
end
he
was
ruthless
so
that
the
war
might
be
brought
the
more
speedily
to
a
close
and
lincoln
the
most
tender
hearted
of
all
men
knew
it
undismayed
therefore
grant
fought
on
but
his
army
was
weary
of
much
fighting
disheartened
by
ill
success
weakened
by
many
losses
new
recruits
indeed
had
been
poured
into
but
they
were
all
unused
to
discipline
months
of
drill
were
needed
before
they
could
become
good
soldiers
in
june
then
grant
settled
down
to
besiege
petersburg
and
drill
his
new
men
the
while
and
not
till
the
spring
of
did
the
army
of
the
potomac
again
take
the
field
meanwhile
there
was
fighting
elsewhere
on
the
part
of
the
confederates
there
was
a
constant
endeavour
to
take
washington
and
in
july
of
this
year
the
confederate
army
actually
came
within
a
few
miles
of
the
city
there
was
great
alarm
in
the
capital
for
it
was
defended
chiefly
by
citizen
soldiers
and
fresh
recruits
who
had
little
knowledge
of
warfare
but
just
in
time
grant
sent
strong
reinforcements
from
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
the
confederates
marched
away
without
making
an
attack
they
only
retired
however
into
the
shenandoah
valley
and
their
presence
there
was
a
constant
menace
to
washington
early
in
august
therefore
general
sheridan
was
sent
to
clear
the
enemy
out
of
the
valley
and
relieve
washington
from
the
constant
fear
of
attack
he
began
his
work
vigorously
and
soon
had
command
of
most
of
the
roads
leading
to
washington
but
he
knew
that
general
jubal
a
early
who
commanded
the
confederate
troops
was
a
skilful
and
tried
soldier
and
to
begin
with
he
moved
with
caution
for
some
weeks
indeed
both
commanders
played
as
it
were
a
game
of
chess
maneuvering
for
advantage
of
position
but
at
length
a
great
battle
was
fought
at
winchester
in
which
the
confederates
were
defeated
and
driven
from
the
field
three
days
later
another
battle
was
fought
at
hill
and
once
again
in
spite
of
gallant
fighting
the
confederates
were
beaten
after
this
battle
sheridan
marched
back
through
the
valley
destroying
and
carrying
away
everything
which
might
be
of
use
to
the
foe
houses
were
left
untouched
but
barns
and
mills
with
all
their
stores
of
food
and
forage
were
burned
to
the
ground
thousands
of
horses
and
cattle
were
driven
off
and
the
rich
and
smiling
valley
made
a
desolation
with
nothing
left
in
it
as
grant
said
to
invite
the
enemy
to
return
having
finished
this
work
sheridan
dashed
off
to
washington
to
consult
with
the
secretary
of
war
about
his
future
movements
the
confederate
army
had
meanwhile
encamped
again
near
fisher
hill
and
early
hearing
of
sheridan
absence
determined
to
make
a
surprise
attack
on
the
federal
army
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
they
set
out
and
stealthily
crept
towards
the
federal
camp
at
cedar
creek
every
care
was
taken
so
that
no
sound
should
be
made
the
men
were
even
ordered
to
leave
their
canteens
behind
lest
they
should
rattle
against
their
rifles
not
a
word
was
spoken
as
the
great
column
crept
onward
climbing
up
and
down
steep
hillsides
fording
streams
pushing
through
thickly
growing
brushwood
at
length
before
sunrise
without
alarm
or
hindrance
of
any
kind
the
confederates
reached
the
camp
of
the
sleeping
federals
each
man
was
soon
in
his
appointed
place
and
in
the
cold
grey
dawn
stood
waiting
the
signal
at
length
a
shot
rang
out
and
with
their
yell
the
confederates
threw
themselves
into
the
camp
as
quickly
as
might
be
the
federals
sprang
up
and
seized
their
arms
but
they
had
been
taken
utterly
by
surprise
and
before
they
could
form
in
battle
array
they
were
scattered
in
flight
before
the
sun
was
well
up
the
federals
were
defeated
and
their
camp
and
cannon
were
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
meanwhile
sheridan
had
reached
winchester
on
his
return
journey
from
washington
he
had
slept
the
night
there
and
had
been
awakened
by
the
sound
of
firing
at
first
he
thought
little
of
it
but
as
the
roar
continued
he
became
sure
that
a
great
battle
was
being
he
was
twenty
miles
away
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
through
the
cool
morning
air
a
steed
as
black
as
steeds
of
night
was
seen
to
pass
as
with
eagle
flight
as
if
he
knew
the
terrible
need
he
stretched
away
with
his
utmost
speed
mile
after
mile
the
great
black
horse
ate
up
the
roads
the
sound
of
firing
grew
louder
and
louder
and
at
length
men
fleeing
in
rout
and
confusion
came
in
sight
there
was
every
sign
of
a
complete
defeat
wounded
unwounded
baggage
wagons
mule
teams
all
were
fleeing
in
confusion
it
was
a
grievous
sight
for
sheridan
but
he
refused
to
accept
defeat
rising
high
in
his
stirrups
he
waved
his
hat
in
the
air
and
shouted
cheerily
face
the
other
way
boys
we
are
going
back
to
our
camp
we
are
going
to
lick
them
into
their
boots
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
fleeing
soldiers
paused
and
with
a
mighty
shout
they
faced
about
even
the
wounded
joined
in
the
cheering
the
beaten
disheartened
army
took
heart
again
the
scattered
disorganized
groups
were
gathered
a
compact
line
of
battle
was
formed
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
the
men
were
not
only
ready
but
eager
once
more
to
grapple
with
the
foe
then
the
second
battle
of
cedar
creek
was
fought
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
federals
had
been
defeated
by
five
in
the
afternoon
the
confederates
were
not
only
defeated
but
utterly
routed
their
army
was
shattered
and
the
war
swept
out
of
the
shenandoah
valley
for
good
and
all
then
sheridan
marched
his
victorious
troops
to
join
grant
before
petersburg
chapter
lincoln
sherman
march
to
the
sea
lincoln
president
grant
plan
of
action
was
twofold
and
while
he
was
fighting
the
second
confederate
army
under
general
johnston
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
sherman
army
was
at
chattanooga
in
tennessee
and
while
grant
was
fighting
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
he
began
his
march
to
atlanta
georgia
fighting
all
the
way
the
confederate
army
always
retreating
before
him
he
slowly
approached
atlanta
at
length
on
september
he
entered
and
took
possession
of
it
here
for
a
few
weeks
the
soldiers
rested
after
their
arduous
labours
the
preparation
for
the
next
campaign
began
all
the
sick
and
wounded
extra
tents
and
baggage
in
fact
every
one
and
everything
which
could
be
done
without
was
sent
back
to
tennessee
for
the
order
had
gone
forth
that
the
army
was
to
travel
light
on
this
campaign
none
but
the
fit
and
strong
were
to
take
part
in
it
and
they
were
to
carry
with
them
only
three
weeks
rations
where
they
were
going
the
men
did
not
know
they
did
not
ask
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
for
sherman
was
leading
them
and
they
knew
he
would
lead
them
to
victory
after
richmond
atlanta
had
supplied
more
guns
and
ammunition
and
other
war
material
for
the
confederacy
than
any
other
town
and
before
he
left
it
sherman
determined
to
destroy
everything
which
might
be
of
use
to
the
enemy
so
he
emptied
the
town
of
all
its
inhabitants
and
blew
up
all
the
gun
and
ammunition
factories
storehouses
and
arsenals
he
tore
up
the
railroads
all
around
atlanta
also
and
last
of
all
cut
the
telegraph
which
linked
him
to
the
north
then
cut
off
as
it
were
from
all
the
world
with
his
force
of
nearly
thousand
men
he
turned
eastward
toward
the
sea
the
army
marched
in
four
divisions
taking
roads
which
as
nearly
as
possible
ran
alongside
each
other
so
that
each
division
might
keep
in
touch
with
the
others
every
morning
at
daybreak
they
broke
camp
and
during
the
day
marched
from
ten
to
fifteen
miles
and
as
they
passed
through
it
they
laid
waste
the
land
railroads
were
torn
up
and
thoroughly
destroyed
the
sleepers
were
made
into
piles
and
set
alight
the
rails
were
laid
on
the
top
of
the
bonfires
and
when
hot
enough
to
be
pliable
were
twisted
beyond
all
possibility
of
being
used
again
telegraph
wires
and
poles
were
torn
down
factories
were
burned
only
private
homes
being
left
untouched
foragers
quartered
the
country
sweeping
it
bare
of
cattle
poultry
fodder
and
corn
for
both
man
and
beast
of
the
great
army
fed
upon
the
land
as
they
passed
through
it
the
rations
with
which
they
had
come
provided
being
kept
in
case
of
need
indeed
the
troops
fed
so
well
that
the
march
it
was
said
was
like
a
continuous
thanksgiving
what
they
did
not
eat
they
destroyed
thus
right
across
the
fertile
land
a
stretch
of
waste
and
desolation
was
created
about
sixty
miles
wide
yet
it
was
not
done
in
wantonness
but
as
a
terrible
necessity
of
war
it
clove
the
confederacy
from
east
to
west
as
thoroughly
as
the
mississippi
clove
it
from
north
to
south
it
rifled
and
exhausted
the
rich
granary
which
fed
the
confederate
army
and
by
destroying
the
railroads
prevented
even
what
was
left
being
sent
to
them
grant
meant
to
end
the
war
and
it
seemed
to
him
more
merciful
to
destroy
food
and
property
than
to
destroy
men
through
all
this
great
raid
there
was
little
fighting
done
and
as
the
army
marched
day
by
day
through
the
sunny
land
a
sort
of
holiday
spirit
pervaded
it
the
work
was
a
work
of
grim
destruction
but
it
was
done
in
the
main
with
good
temper
the
sun
shone
the
men
led
a
free
and
hardy
life
growing
daily
more
brown
and
sinewy
and
at
the
end
of
the
march
of
nearly
three
hundred
miles
far
from
being
worn
out
they
were
more
fit
and
strong
than
when
they
set
forth
by
the
second
week
in
december
the
goal
was
reached
savannah
and
the
sea
here
the
army
joined
hands
with
the
navy
fort
mcallister
which
defended
the
south
side
of
the
city
was
taken
by
a
brilliant
assault
and
sherman
prepared
for
a
siege
of
savannah
both
by
land
and
water
but
in
the
night
the
confederates
quietly
slipped
out
of
the
city
and
retreated
across
the
swamps
when
their
flight
was
discovered
they
were
already
beyond
reach
of
pursuit
and
with
hardly
a
blow
struck
the
city
of
savannah
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
federals
the
great
march
had
ended
triumphantly
on
december
i
beg
to
present
to
you
as
a
christmas
gift
wrote
sherman
to
lincoln
the
city
of
savannah
with
a
hundred
and
heavy
guns
and
plenty
of
ammunition
and
also
about
thousand
bales
of
cotton
this
news
followed
hard
on
the
news
of
another
victory
for
on
december
and
the
federals
under
general
george
thomas
had
fought
a
great
battle
at
nashville
tennessee
in
which
the
confederates
had
been
defeated
by
this
battle
their
strength
beyond
the
alleghenies
was
practically
crushed
so
as
the
year
closed
the
hopes
of
the
federals
rose
high
early
in
still
another
victory
was
recorded
in
the
taking
of
fort
fisher
in
north
carolina
this
was
the
last
port
in
the
possession
of
the
confederates
with
it
they
lost
their
last
link
with
the
outside
world
and
the
blockade
which
lincoln
had
proclaimed
nearly
four
years
before
was
at
length
complete
all
hope
of
success
now
utterly
vanished
for
the
confederates
even
lee
knew
it
and
he
might
have
advised
the
south
to
lay
down
arms
but
jefferson
davis
the
southern
president
doggedly
refused
to
own
himself
beaten
so
the
war
continued
on
the
of
february
sherman
set
out
from
savannah
on
a
second
march
this
time
he
turned
northward
and
carried
his
victorious
army
right
through
the
carolinas
the
march
was
longer
by
more
than
a
hundred
miles
than
his
now
famous
march
to
the
sea
it
was
one
too
of
much
greater
difficulty
indeed
compared
with
it
the
march
to
the
sea
had
been
a
mere
picnic
the
weather
now
was
horrible
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
the
army
floundered
through
seas
of
mud
along
the
whole
way
too
they
were
harassed
by
the
foe
and
hardly
a
day
passed
without
fighting
of
some
sort
but
like
an
inexorable
fate
sherman
pressed
on
destroying
railroads
and
arsenals
creating
a
desert
about
him
until
at
length
he
joined
forces
with
grant
in
the
midst
of
this
devastating
war
while
some
states
were
fighting
for
separation
another
new
state
was
added
to
the
union
this
was
nevada
nevada
is
spanish
and
means
snowy
and
the
state
takes
its
name
from
the
snowy
topped
mountains
which
run
through
it
it
was
formed
out
of
part
of
the
mexican
territory
like
west
virginia
the
other
state
it
was
true
to
the
union
and
scanty
though
the
population
was
it
raised
more
than
a
thousand
men
for
the
union
cause
now
too
in
the
midst
of
war
in
november
of
came
the
time
of
electing
a
new
president
many
people
were
tired
of
the
war
they
had
expected
it
to
last
for
a
few
months
and
it
had
lasted
for
years
and
some
of
them
were
inclined
to
blame
lincoln
for
it
so
they
wanted
a
new
president
but
for
the
most
part
the
people
loved
lincoln
he
was
father
abe
to
them
and
even
those
who
wanted
a
change
agreed
with
lincoln
himself
when
he
said
that
it
was
not
well
to
swap
horses
when
crossing
a
stream
so
lincoln
was
triumphantly
elected
and
on
march
he
was
inaugurated
for
the
second
time
he
made
the
shortest
speech
ever
made
on
such
an
occasion
and
he
closed
this
short
speech
with
the
most
beautiful
and
unforgettable
words
with
malice
towards
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
for
his
orphan
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and
with
all
nations
chapter
lincoln
the
end
of
the
war
the
president
death
no
president
ever
took
up
his
burden
in
a
more
great
hearted
fashion
than
lincoln
no
president
ever
faced
the
difficulties
of
his
position
with
so
much
tenderness
and
so
much
strength
but
he
felt
his
burdens
lie
heavy
on
his
shoulders
deep
lines
of
pain
were
graven
on
his
face
and
to
his
sad
eyes
there
came
a
deeper
sadness
yet
he
never
lost
heart
and
even
in
the
gravest
moments
he
would
pause
to
tell
a
funny
story
i
should
break
down
otherwise
he
said
he
had
no
anger
against
the
south
only
a
deep
pity
a
deep
desire
to
see
the
country
one
again
so
much
as
he
longed
for
peace
he
would
listen
to
no
proposal
which
did
not
mean
peace
with
union
and
as
jefferson
davis
declared
that
he
would
rather
die
than
see
north
and
south
united
the
war
continued
on
the
of
april
a
great
battle
was
fought
at
five
forks
a
few
miles
from
petersburg
in
this
the
confederates
were
defeated
and
more
than
five
thousand
were
taken
prisoner
the
next
day
true
to
his
hammering
policy
grant
ordered
a
great
assault
all
along
the
lines
before
petersburg
at
daybreak
the
attack
began
and
again
the
federals
were
victorious
all
that
brave
men
could
do
the
confederates
did
but
their
valour
availed
them
nothing
they
were
far
outnumbered
and
their
line
was
pierced
in
many
places
that
morning
president
davis
was
sitting
in
church
at
richmond
when
a
dispatch
from
lee
was
brought
to
him
my
lines
are
broken
it
said
richmond
must
be
evacuated
this
evening
quickly
and
silently
jefferson
davis
left
the
church
his
day
of
power
was
over
and
with
his
cabinet
and
officials
he
fled
from
richmond
soon
the
news
spread
throughout
the
southern
capital
and
panic
seized
upon
the
people
warehouses
filled
with
tobacco
and
cotton
were
set
in
flames
all
that
was
evil
in
the
city
broke
loose
the
prison
was
emptied
rogues
and
robbers
worked
their
will
soon
the
streets
were
filled
with
a
struggling
mob
of
people
some
bent
on
plunder
others
on
fleeing
from
the
place
of
terror
and
turmoil
the
night
passed
in
confusion
and
horror
past
description
then
the
next
day
the
federals
took
possession
of
the
distracted
city
and
in
a
few
hours
the
tumult
was
hushed
the
flames
subdued
and
something
like
order
restored
meanwhile
without
entering
the
city
grant
was
hotly
pursuing
lee
and
his
army
the
chase
was
no
long
one
lee
army
was
worn
out
ragged
barefoot
and
starving
grant
with
an
army
nearly
three
times
as
large
and
well
equipped
besides
soon
completely
surrounded
him
north
south
east
and
west
escape
there
was
none
there
is
nothing
left
me
but
to
go
and
see
general
grant
said
lee
and
i
would
rather
die
a
thousand
deaths
but
like
the
brave
soldier
he
was
he
faced
what
seemed
worse
that
death
rather
than
uselessly
sacrifice
gallant
lives
a
few
letters
passed
between
the
two
great
leaders
then
they
met
in
a
private
house
at
appomattox
court
house
the
contrast
between
the
two
was
great
lee
looked
the
southern
aristocrat
he
was
and
tall
erect
still
in
spite
of
his
sixty
years
he
was
dressed
in
splendid
uniform
and
wore
a
jeweled
sword
at
his
side
grant
half
a
head
shorter
fifteen
years
younger
seemed
but
a
rough
soldier
beside
him
he
wore
only
the
blue
blouse
of
a
private
and
carried
no
sword
nothing
betraying
his
rank
except
his
shoulder
straps
it
was
lee
first
meeting
with
unconditional
surrender
grant
but
this
time
grant
drove
no
hard
bargain
i
felt
like
anything
rather
than
rejoicing
at
the
downfall
of
a
foe
who
had
fought
so
long
and
valiantly
he
said
many
years
after
the
war
was
over
and
there
was
no
need
of
severity
so
officers
and
men
alike
were
all
released
on
the
promise
that
they
would
not
again
take
up
arms
against
the
united
states
the
officers
were
allowed
to
keep
their
swords
their
horses
and
belongings
the
privates
also
were
allowed
to
keep
their
horses
for
as
grant
said
they
would
need
them
for
their
spring
ploughing
everything
being
settled
lee
returned
to
his
men
to
break
the
news
to
them
his
face
was
stern
and
sad
as
he
faced
his
worn
and
ragged
troops
as
he
looked
at
them
words
failed
him
men
he
said
we
have
fought
through
the
war
together
and
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
for
you
then
he
ceased
tears
blinded
and
choked
him
sobs
burst
from
the
hardy
men
who
had
followed
him
joyfully
to
death
so
they
said
farewell
grant
on
his
side
would
allow
no
rejoicing
in
his
camp
no
firing
of
salutes
the
war
is
over
he
said
the
rebels
are
our
countrymen
again
and
indeed
this
was
the
end
of
the
war
although
for
a
week
or
two
the
confederates
elsewhere
still
held
out
when
the
news
was
heard
throughout
the
country
people
went
mad
with
joy
the
great
day
of
peace
had
come
at
last
and
all
the
world
went
people
who
were
utter
strangers
to
each
other
shook
hands
in
the
street
they
laughed
and
cried
bonfires
were
lit
and
bells
rung
never
had
there
been
such
rejoicing
in
the
land
and
among
those
who
rejoiced
none
was
more
glad
than
the
president
i
thank
god
he
said
that
i
have
lived
to
see
this
day
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
been
dreaming
a
horrid
dream
for
five
years
but
now
the
nightmare
is
gone
and
already
his
thoughts
were
turned
to
the
binding
up
of
the
nation
wounds
it
was
the
of
april
and
he
had
promised
to
go
to
the
theatre
that
evening
he
did
not
want
to
go
but
his
presence
had
been
announced
in
the
papers
and
thinking
that
the
people
would
be
disappointed
if
he
failed
to
appear
he
went
it
was
about
nine
in
the
evening
when
the
president
entered
his
box
with
his
wife
and
one
or
two
friends
as
soon
as
he
appeared
the
people
rose
from
their
seats
and
cheered
and
cheered
again
and
the
actors
stopped
their
play
until
the
audience
grew
calm
again
in
a
few
minutes
all
was
quiet
once
more
and
for
an
hour
the
play
went
on
then
while
everyone
in
the
box
was
intent
upon
the
stage
a
man
crept
softly
through
the
door
and
stood
beside
the
president
suddenly
a
sharp
pistol
shot
rang
out
and
without
a
groan
the
great
president
fell
forward
dying
his
wicked
work
done
the
man
sprang
from
the
box
on
to
the
stage
shouting
sic
semper
tyrannis
thus
let
it
ever
be
with
tyrants
as
he
sprang
his
foot
caught
in
the
flag
which
draped
the
box
he
fell
with
a
crash
and
broke
a
bone
in
his
leg
but
in
spite
of
the
hurt
he
jumped
up
then
fiercely
brandishing
a
dagger
and
shouting
the
south
is
avenged
he
disappeared
the
murderer
was
a
man
named
john
wilkes
booth
he
was
a
second
rate
and
conceited
actor
having
a
vast
idea
of
his
own
importance
with
him
and
the
small
band
of
fanatics
he
ruled
the
leaders
of
the
south
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
indeed
by
his
act
he
proved
himself
to
be
their
worst
enemy
now
hurrying
out
of
the
theatre
he
mounted
a
horse
which
was
held
in
readiness
and
galloped
away
through
the
night
meanwhile
the
dying
president
was
quickly
carried
into
a
house
near
but
nothing
that
love
or
science
could
do
availed
the
kind
grey
eyes
were
closed
never
to
open
again
the
gentle
voice
was
stilled
forever
all
night
he
lay
moaning
softly
then
as
morning
dawned
a
look
of
utter
peace
came
upon
his
face
and
the
moaning
ceased
deep
silence
fell
upon
every
one
around
the
bed
the
secretary
of
war
was
the
first
to
break
it
now
he
belongs
to
the
ages
he
said
so
the
great
president
passed
on
his
way
and
the
people
mourned
as
they
had
mourned
for
no
other
man
as
to
the
negroes
they
wept
and
cried
aloud
and
would
not
be
comforted
for
massa
linkum
was
dead
and
they
were
left
fatherless
chapter
johnson
how
the
president
was
impeached
the
andrew
johnson
now
became
president
like
lincoln
he
came
of
very
poor
people
he
taught
himself
how
to
read
but
could
not
write
until
after
his
marriage
when
his
wife
taught
him
in
many
ways
he
thought
as
lincoln
did
but
he
had
none
of
lincoln
wonderful
tact
in
dealing
with
men
he
could
not
win
men
love
as
lincoln
had
done
i
tell
you
said
a
confederate
soldier
speaking
of
lincoln
he
had
the
most
magnificient
face
and
eyes
that
i
have
ever
gazed
into
if
he
had
walked
up
and
down
the
confederate
line
of
battle
there
would
have
been
no
battle
i
was
his
body
and
soul
from
the
time
i
felt
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
the
southerners
would
have
found
a
friend
in
lincoln
but
now
that
friend
was
lost
to
them
had
he
lived
much
of
the
bitterness
of
the
time
after
the
war
would
never
have
been
president
johnson
had
a
very
hard
task
before
him
he
had
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
and
the
north
and
south
but
he
had
neither
the
tact
nor
the
strength
needed
for
this
great
task
at
first
it
was
thought
he
would
be
too
hard
on
the
south
then
it
was
thought
he
would
be
too
lenient
and
soon
he
was
at
loggerheads
with
congress
for
the
south
this
time
was
a
time
of
bitterness
the
confederate
states
were
divided
into
five
districts
each
district
being
ruled
over
by
an
officer
with
an
army
of
soldiers
under
him
from
the
men
who
had
led
the
rebellion
all
power
of
voting
was
taken
away
while
at
the
same
time
it
was
given
to
negroes
the
negroes
were
very
ignorant
they
had
no
knowledge
of
how
to
use
their
votes
so
a
swarm
of
greedy
adventurers
from
the
north
swooped
down
upon
the
south
cajoled
the
negroes
into
voting
for
them
and
soon
had
the
government
of
these
states
under
their
control
these
men
were
called
for
it
was
said
they
packed
all
their
belongings
into
a
carpet
bag
they
had
no
possessions
no
interests
in
the
south
they
came
not
to
help
the
south
but
to
make
money
out
of
it
and
under
their
rule
the
condition
of
the
southern
states
became
truly
pitiful
but
at
length
this
wretched
time
passed
the
troops
were
withdrawn
the
followed
and
the
government
once
more
came
into
the
hands
of
better
men
meanwhile
bitterness
had
increased
between
the
president
and
congress
and
now
in
congress
brought
a
bill
to
lessen
the
power
this
was
called
the
tenure
of
office
bill
by
it
the
president
was
forbidden
to
dismiss
any
holder
of
a
civil
office
without
the
consent
of
the
senate
the
command
of
the
army
was
also
taken
from
him
and
he
was
only
allowed
to
give
orders
to
the
soldiers
through
the
the
president
of
course
vetoed
this
bill
but
congress
passed
it
in
spite
of
his
veto
this
can
be
done
if
of
the
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate
vote
for
a
bill
so
the
tenure
of
office
bill
became
law
now
the
president
has
grown
to
dislike
edwin
stanton
the
secretary
of
war
he
disliked
him
so
heartily
indeed
that
he
would
no
longer
speak
to
him
and
so
he
determined
in
spite
of
the
tenure
of
office
bill
to
get
rid
of
a
man
he
looked
upon
as
an
enemy
so
stanton
was
dismissed
but
stanton
refused
to
go
and
when
his
successor
general
thomas
appointed
by
the
president
walked
into
the
war
office
he
found
stanton
still
in
possession
with
his
friends
round
him
i
claim
the
office
of
secretary
of
war
and
demand
it
by
order
of
the
president
said
thomas
i
deny
your
authority
and
order
you
back
to
your
own
office
said
stanton
i
will
stand
here
said
thomas
i
want
no
unpleasantness
in
the
presence
of
these
gentlemen
you
can
stand
there
if
you
please
but
you
can
not
act
as
secretary
of
war
i
am
secretary
of
war
and
i
order
you
out
of
this
office
and
to
your
own
cried
stanton
i
will
not
obey
you
but
will
stand
here
and
remain
here
insisted
thomas
in
spite
of
his
insistence
however
he
was
at
last
got
rid
of
but
it
was
impossible
that
things
should
go
on
in
this
fashion
the
senate
was
angry
because
its
authority
had
been
set
at
nought
but
it
could
do
little
but
express
its
wrath
then
the
house
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
the
president
was
impeached
before
the
senate
for
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
in
office
but
andrew
johnson
did
not
care
the
house
sat
in
judgment
on
him
but
he
never
appeared
before
it
he
knew
the
impeachment
was
only
make
believe
on
the
part
of
his
enemies
to
try
and
get
rid
of
him
so
he
chose
lawyers
to
defend
him
but
never
appeared
in
court
himself
for
ten
days
the
trial
lasted
the
excitement
throughout
the
country
was
intense
and
on
the
last
day
when
the
verdict
was
given
the
court
was
packed
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
great
crowds
unable
to
get
inside
waited
without
in
tense
silence
each
senator
rose
and
gave
his
verdict
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
when
the
votes
were
counted
it
was
found
that
the
president
was
declared
guilty
there
were
senators
and
to
convict
the
president
it
was
necessary
that
should
declare
him
guilty
said
guilty
and
nineteen
not
guilty
thus
he
was
saved
by
just
one
vote
stanton
then
quietly
gave
up
the
post
to
which
he
had
clung
so
persistently
another
man
took
his
place
and
the
president
remained
henceforth
undisturbed
until
the
end
of
his
term
during
johnson
presidency
another
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
this
was
nebraska
it
was
formed
out
of
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
the
name
being
an
indian
one
meaning
shallow
water
it
had
been
formed
into
a
territory
at
the
time
of
the
famous
bill
and
now
in
march
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
the
state
this
year
too
the
territory
of
alaska
was
added
to
the
united
states
alaska
belonged
to
russia
by
right
of
vitus
bering
discovery
it
was
from
this
vitus
bering
that
the
bering
strait
and
bering
sea
take
their
names
the
russians
did
very
little
with
alaska
and
after
a
hundred
years
or
more
they
decided
that
they
did
not
want
it
for
it
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
empire
by
a
stormy
sea
and
in
time
of
war
would
be
difficult
to
protect
so
they
offered
to
sell
it
to
the
united
states
but
nothing
came
of
it
then
and
for
some
years
the
matter
dropped
for
the
war
came
and
blotted
out
all
thoughts
of
alaska
but
now
peace
had
come
and
the
subject
was
taken
up
again
and
at
length
the
matter
was
settled
russia
received
seven
million
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
alaska
became
a
territory
of
the
united
states
a
party
of
american
soldiers
was
landed
at
the
town
of
sitka
they
marched
to
the
governor
house
and
there
were
drawn
up
beside
the
russian
troops
then
the
russian
commander
ordered
the
russian
flag
to
be
hauled
down
and
made
a
short
speech
thereupon
the
soldiers
of
both
countries
fired
a
salute
the
american
flag
was
run
up
and
the
ceremony
was
at
an
end
thus
another
huge
territory
was
added
to
the
united
states
but
at
first
many
people
were
displeased
at
the
purchase
it
was
a
useless
and
barren
country
they
thought
where
the
winters
were
so
long
and
cold
that
it
was
quite
unfit
for
a
dwelling
place
for
white
men
but
soon
it
was
found
that
the
whale
and
seal
fisheries
were
very
valuable
and
later
gold
was
discovered
it
has
also
been
found
to
be
rich
in
other
minerals
especially
coal
and
in
timber
and
altogether
has
proven
a
useful
addition
to
the
country
chapter
grant
a
peaceful
victory
in
general
grant
who
had
made
such
a
great
name
for
himself
during
the
civil
war
became
president
grant
was
a
brave
and
honest
soldier
he
knew
little
however
about
politics
but
now
that
lincoln
was
gone
the
people
loved
him
better
than
any
other
man
so
he
became
president
his
was
a
simple
trusting
soul
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
evil
of
any
one
and
he
was
easily
misled
by
men
who
sought
not
their
country
good
but
their
own
gain
so
mistakes
were
made
during
his
presidency
but
these
may
be
forgotten
while
men
must
always
remember
his
greatness
as
a
soldier
and
his
nobleness
as
a
victor
he
helped
to
bring
peace
to
his
country
and
like
his
great
leader
he
tried
after
war
was
past
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
when
grant
came
into
power
the
echoes
of
the
great
war
were
still
heard
the
south
had
not
yet
returned
into
peaceful
union
with
the
north
and
there
was
an
unsettled
quarrel
with
britain
the
quarrel
arose
in
this
way
during
the
civil
war
the
british
had
allowed
the
confederates
to
build
ships
in
britain
these
ships
had
afterwards
sailed
out
from
british
ports
and
had
done
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
union
shipping
the
british
had
declared
themselves
neutral
that
is
they
had
declared
that
they
would
take
neither
one
side
nor
the
other
but
said
the
americans
in
allowing
confederate
ships
to
be
built
in
britain
the
british
had
taken
the
confederate
side
and
had
committed
a
breach
of
neutrality
and
for
the
damage
done
to
their
ships
the
americans
now
claimed
recompense
from
the
british
government
the
ship
which
had
done
the
most
damage
was
called
the
alabama
and
from
this
the
claims
made
by
america
were
called
the
alabama
claims
at
first
however
the
british
refused
to
consider
the
claims
at
all
for
years
letters
went
to
and
fro
between
the
two
governments
and
as
the
british
still
refused
to
settle
the
matter
feeling
in
america
began
to
run
high
but
at
length
the
british
consented
to
talk
the
matter
over
and
a
commission
of
five
british
and
five
americans
met
at
washington
after
sitting
for
two
months
this
commission
formed
what
is
known
as
the
washington
treaty
by
this
treaty
it
was
arranged
that
the
alabama
claims
should
be
decided
by
arbitration
a
court
of
arbitration
was
to
be
formed
of
five
men
and
of
this
court
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
queen
of
england
the
king
of
italy
the
president
of
switzerland
and
the
emperor
of
brazil
were
each
to
choose
a
member
the
men
chosen
by
these
rulers
met
at
geneva
in
switzerland
and
after
discussing
the
matter
for
a
long
time
they
decided
that
britain
had
been
to
blame
and
must
pay
the
united
states
fifteen
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
thus
the
matter
was
settled
in
a
peaceful
way
fifty
years
before
a
like
quarrel
might
have
led
to
war
between
the
two
countries
even
at
this
time
with
less
wise
leadership
on
either
side
it
might
have
come
to
war
but
war
was
avoided
and
a
great
victory
for
peace
was
won
besides
the
alabama
claims
the
last
dispute
about
boundaries
between
the
united
states
and
canada
was
settled
at
this
time
this
also
was
settled
by
arbitration
the
german
emperor
being
chosen
as
arbiter
this
said
president
grant
leaves
us
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
as
a
nation
without
a
question
of
disputed
boundary
between
our
territory
and
the
possessions
of
great
britain
grant
was
twice
chosen
as
president
and
it
was
during
his
second
term
that
colorado
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
the
state
the
new
state
was
formed
partly
out
of
the
mexican
concession
partly
out
of
the
louisiana
purchase
and
was
named
after
the
great
river

hayes
garfield
arthur
in
rutherford
hayes
became
president
ever
since
the
civil
war
a
great
part
of
the
south
had
been
in
constant
turmoil
soldiers
were
still
stationed
in
the
capitals
of
the
various
states
and
the
government
still
continued
but
hayes
wished
to
put
an
end
to
this
so
he
got
the
principal
white
people
in
the
south
to
promise
that
they
would
help
to
keep
law
and
order
then
he
withdrew
all
the
troops
without
their
aid
the
bag
government
could
not
stand
and
the
white
men
of
the
south
once
more
began
to
rule
in
the
south
president
hayes
also
tried
to
lessen
the
evil
of
the
spoils
system
in
this
he
met
a
good
deal
of
opposition
but
the
system
of
passing
examinations
was
begun
for
some
posts
after
the
troublous
times
that
had
gone
before
this
was
a
time
of
peace
in
which
for
the
first
time
since
the
war
north
and
south
seemed
once
more
united
in
james
garfield
became
president
like
other
presidents
before
him
his
boyhood
had
been
one
of
poverty
and
hard
work
but
from
doing
odd
labouring
jobs
or
tending
barge
horses
on
the
ohio
canal
he
had
gradually
worked
upwards
he
had
been
farmer
carpenter
school
teacher
lawyer
and
soldier
having
in
the
civil
war
reached
the
rank
of
general
at
he
entered
congress
and
there
soon
made
his
mark
now
he
had
become
president
and
as
soon
as
he
took
up
his
office
he
was
besieged
by
office
seekers
they
thronged
his
house
they
stopped
him
in
the
street
him
in
railway
carriages
they
flattered
coaxed
threatened
and
made
his
life
a
burden
but
in
spite
of
all
this
worrying
the
new
president
determined
to
do
what
he
could
to
end
the
spoils
system
and
appoint
people
only
for
the
sake
of
the
public
good
accordingly
he
made
many
enemies
among
the
many
whom
the
president
was
forced
to
disappoint
was
a
bad
young
man
named
guiteau
garfield
saw
plainly
that
he
was
quite
unfit
to
fill
any
government
post
and
he
refused
to
employ
him
thereupon
guiteau
heart
was
filled
with
hate
against
the
president
he
brooded
over
his
wrongs
till
his
hate
became
madness
and
in
this
madness
he
determined
to
kill
his
enemy
since
he
took
up
office
the
president
had
been
hard
at
work
now
in
july
he
determined
to
take
a
short
holiday
in
new
england
and
visit
garfield
who
had
been
ill
and
had
gone
away
for
a
change
of
air
on
saturday
the
of
july
the
morning
on
which
he
was
going
to
set
out
he
awoke
in
excellent
spirits
before
he
got
up
one
of
his
sons
came
into
his
room
the
boy
took
a
flying
leap
over
his
father
bed
there
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
are
the
president
of
the
united
states
but
you
ca
do
that
ca
i
said
the
president
and
he
got
up
and
did
it
in
the
same
good
spirits
he
drove
to
the
station
as
he
walked
along
the
platform
a
man
with
an
evil
look
on
his
face
followed
him
suddenly
a
pistol
shot
was
heard
and
a
bullet
passed
through
the
president
sleeve
and
did
no
harm
it
was
quickly
followed
however
by
a
second
which
hit
the
president
full
in
the
back
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
the
president
was
sorely
wounded
but
not
killed
a
mattress
was
quickly
brought
and
he
was
gently
carried
to
the
white
house
then
a
message
was
sent
to
garfield
telling
her
what
had
happened
and
bidding
her
come
home
she
and
her
daughter
had
been
happily
awaiting
the
president
coming
to
them
now
everything
was
changed
and
in
sorrow
and
haste
they
went
to
him
for
nearly
three
months
president
garfield
lingered
on
at
times
he
seemed
much
stronger
and
those
who
loved
him
believed
he
would
recover
but
by
degrees
their
hopes
faded
and
in
september
he
died
once
again
the
sorrowing
nation
followed
their
president
to
the
grave
and
once
again
the
took
office
as
president
the
new
president
was
named
chester
arthur
and
on
taking
office
he
was
less
known
to
the
country
than
any
president
before
him
he
came
to
office
in
a
time
of
peace
and
prosperity
and
although
nothing
very
exciting
happened
during
his
presidency
he
showed
himself
both
wise
and
patriotic
the
best
thing
to
remember
him
for
is
his
fight
against
the
spoils
system
ever
since
grant
had
been
president
men
who
loved
their
country
and
wanted
to
see
it
well
served

fought
for
civil
service
reform
garfield
sad
death
made
many
people
who
had
not
thought
of
it
before
see
that
the
spoils
system
was
bad
for
it
had
been
a
disappointed
seeker
of
spoils
who
killed
him
so
at
last
in
a
law
was
passed
which
provided
that
certain
appointments
should
be
made
by
competitive
examinations
and
not
given
haphazard
at
first
this
law
only
applied
to
a
few
classes
of
appointments
but
by
degrees
its
scope
was
enlarged
until
now
nearly
all
civil
service
appointments
are
made
through
examinations

of

came
to
an
end
and
grover
cleveland
became
president
he
was
the
son
of
a
clergyman
and
it
was
intended
that
he
should
have
a
college
education
but
his
father
died
when
he
was
only
sixteen
and
he
had
to
begin
at
once
to
earn
his
own
living
grover
cleveland
however
determined
to
be
a
lawyer
and
with
dollars
in
his
pocket
he
set
out
from
home
to
seek
his
fortune
he
did
two
or
three
odd
jobs
by
the
way
but
soon
got
a
place
as
clerk
in
a
lawyer
office
in
buffalo
his
foot
was
thus
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
which
he
wished
to
climb
and
he
climbed
steadily
until
years
later
he
was
chosen
mayor
of
buffalo
as
mayor
he
soon
made
a
name
for
himself
by
his
fearless
honesty
and
businesslike
ways
he
would
not
permit
unlawful
or
unwise
spending
of
public
money
and
he
stopped
so
many
extravagant
acts
of
the
council
that
he
became
known
as
the
veto
mayor
and
he
saved
the
town
taxpayers
thousands
of
dollars
a
year
next
he
became
governor
of
new
york
state
as
governor
he
continued
his
same
fearless
path
vetoing
everything
which
he
considered
dishonest
or
in
any
way
harmful
and
as
president
cleveland
was
just
as
fearless
and
honest
as
before
during
the
four
years
of
his
presidency
he
used
his
power
of
veto
more
than
three
hundred
times
as
one
would
expect
from
such
a
man
cleveland
stood
firm
on
the
question
of
civil
service
reform
the
people
pay
for
the
government
he
said
and
it
is
only
right
that
government
work
should
be
well
done
posts
should
be
given
to
those
who
are
fit
to
fill
them
and
not
merely
to
those
who
have
friends
to
push
them
into
notice
president
cleveland
also
tried
to
get
the
tariffs
on
imported
goods
reduced
he
discovered
that
there
was
more
money
in
the
treasury
than
the
country
required
during
the
war
duties
had
been
made
high
because
the
government
required
a
great
deal
of
money
but
after
the
war
was
over
and
there
was
no
need
for
so
much
money
these
high
duties
had
still
been
kept
on
the
consequence
was
that
millions
of
dollars
were
being
heaped
up
in
the
treasury
and
were
lying
idle
the
president
therefore
thought
that
the
tariffs
should
be
reduced
and
he
said
so
but
there
were
so
many
people
in
the
country
who
thought
that
a
high
tariff
was
good
that
when
in
the
next
presidency
a
new
tariff
bill
was
introduced
the
duties
were
made
higher
than
ever

been

for

during

six
new
states
were
admitted
into
the

the
two
first
of
these
were
north
and
south
dakota
the
name
in
indian
meaning
allies
it
was
the
name
the
allied
tribes
gave
themselves
but
their
neighbours
called
them
nadowaysioux
which
means
enemies
the
white
people
however
shortened
it
to
sioux
and
north
dakota
is
sometimes
called
the
sioux
state
both
north
and
south
dakota
were
formed
out
of
the
louisiana
purchase
in
they
had
been
organised
as
the
territory
of
dakota
seventeen
years
or
so
later
they
were
divided
into
north
and
south
dakota
and
were
admitted
as
states
in
november
two
or
three
days
later
montana
was
admitted
this
state
was
formed
partly
out
of
the
louisiana
purchase
and
partly
out
of
the
oregon
country
the
rocky
mountains
cross
the
state
and
its
name
comes
from
a
spanish
word
meaning
mountainous
after
lewis
and
clark
explored
the
country
many
fur
traders
were
attracted
to
it
but
it
was
not
until
gold
was
discovered
there
that
settlers
came
in
large
numbers
in
spite
of
terrible
trouble
with
the
indians
and
much
war
and
bloodshed
year
by
year
the
settlers
increased
and
in
the
territory
was
admitted
as
a
state
a
few
days
after
montana
the
state
of
washington
was
admitted
to
the
union
it
was
part
of
the
oregon
country
and
was
of
course
named
after
the
great
father
of
his
country
george
washington
in
the
following
year
idaho
became
a
state
its
name
is
indian
meaning
gem
of
the
mountains
this
state
like
washington
was
formed
out
of
the
oregon
country
the
first
white
men
who
are
known
to
have
passed
through
it
were
lewis
and
clark
but
as
in
montana
it
was
not
until
gold
was
discovered
that
settlers
in
any
great
numbers
were
attracted
there
one
very
interesting
thing
about
idaho
is
that
it
was
the
second
state
to
introduce
women
suffrage
that
is
women
within
the
state
have
the
same
right
of
voting
as
men
but
the
first
state
to
introduce
women
suffrage
was
wyoming
which
was
admitted
to
the
union
a
few
days
after
idaho
this
state
was
formed
out
of
parts
of
all
three
of
the
great
territories
which
had
been
added
to
the
united
states
the
east
was
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
the
west
was
part
of
the
oregon
country
and
the
south
part
of
the
mexican
cession
it
has
much
fine
pasture
land
and
its

was
elected
president
this
is
the
only
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
that
an
has
again
come
to
office
after
an
interval
of
years
four
hundred
years
had
now
passed
since
columbus
discovered
america
and
it
was
decided
to
celebrate
the
occasion
by
holding
a
great
world
fair
at
chicago
it
was
not
possible
however
to
get
everything
ready
in
time
to
hold
the
celebration
in
which
was
the
actual
anniversary
so
the
exhibition
was
opened
the
following
year
instead
there
had
been
other
exhibitions
in
america
of
the
same
kind
but
none
so
splendid
as
the
columbian
fair
it
was
fitting
that
it
should
be
splendid
as
it
commemorated
the
first
act
in
the
life
of
a
great
nation
in
these
four
hundred
years
what
wonders
had
been
performed
since
columbus
first
showed
the
way
across
the
sea
of
darkness
millions
had
followed
in
his
track
and
the
vast
wilderness
of
the
unknown
continent
had
been
people
from
shore
to
shore
millions
of
people
from
all
over
the
world
came
to
visit
the
white
city
as
it
came
to
be
called
and
men
of
every
nation
wandered
through
its
stately
halls
and
among
its
fair
lawns
and
gardens
where
things
of
art
and
beauty
were
gathered
from
every
clime
but
most
interesting
of
all
were
the
exhibits
which
showed
the
progress
that
had
been
made
in
these
four
hundred
years
there
one
might
see
copies
of
the
frail
little
vessels
in
which
columbus
braved
the
unknown
horrors
of
the
sea
of
darkness
as
well
as
models
of
the
ocean
going
leviathans
of
during
cleveland
second
term
of
office
still
another
state
entered
the
union
this
was
utah
the
state
founded
by
the
mormons
polygamy
being
forbidden
it
was
admitted
in
as
the
state
chapter
mckinley
war
and
sudden
death
in
william
mckinley
became
president
like
some
other
presidents
before
him
he
came
of
very
humble
people
and
had
by
his
own
efforts
raised
himself
until
at
length
he
held
the
highest
office
in
the
land
mckinley
was
a
keen
protectionist
that
is
he
believed
in
putting
a
heavy
duty
on
foreign
goods
coming
into
the
country
not
in
order
to
get
revenue
or
income
for
the
needs
of
the
government
but
in
order
to
protect
the
home
manufacturer
he
wanted
to
put
such
a
high
duty
on
foreign
goods
that
the
home
manufacturer
could
sell
his
goods
at
a
high
price
and
still
undersell
the
foreigner
in
president
harrison
time
mckinley
then
a
member
of
congress
succeeded
in
getting
the
tariff
made
higher
than
ever
before
and
the
act
then
passed
was
known
as
the
mckinley
tariff
act
and
just
as
president
monroe
is
known
outside
america
chiefly
because
of
the
monroe
doctrine
so
president
mckinley
is
known
because
of
the
mckinley
tariff
act
for
many
years
now
the
united
states
had
been
at
peace
but
the
year
after
mckinley
came
into
office
the
country
was
once
more
plunged
into
war
in
days
long
ago
when
englishmen
were
struggling
to
found
a
colony
in
virginia
spain
was
a
great
and
powerful
nation
and
her
dominions
in
the
new
world
were
vast
but
because
of
her
pride
and
her
cruelty
spain
lost
these
dominions
one
by
one
until
at
length
there
remained
in
the
western
hemisphere
only
a
few
islands
the
largest
of
which
was
cuba
but
even
these
were
not
secure
and
again
and
again
the
cubans
rose
in
rebellion
against
their
spanish
oppressors
the
spaniards
waged
war
against
their
revolted
subjects
in
most
cruel
fashion
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
looked
on
with
sorrow
and
indignation
at
the
barbarous
deeds
which
were
done
at
their
very
doors
mckinley
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
civil
war
and
had
fought
well
and
gallantly
for
the
flag
but
like
other
soldier
presidents
he
loved
peace
more
than
war
like
cleveland
before
him
he
felt
unwilling
to
plunge
the
country
into
war
so
he
shut
his
ears
and
turned
away
his
eyes
from
the
misery
of
cuba
but
there
were
many
americans
in
cuba
they
as
well
as
the
cubans
were
being
starved
so
ships
were
sent
to
cuba
with
food
for
them
and
in
this
way
not
only
they
but
many
cubans
were
saved
from
starvation
then
a
united
states
battleship
called
the
maine
was
sent
to
cuba
and
anchored
in
the
harbour
of
havana
to
be
ready
in
case
of
need
to
help
the
americans
for
three
weeks
the
maine
lay
rocking
at
anchor
then
on
the
night
of
february
while
every
one
on
board
was
peacefully
sleeping
the
vessel
was
blown
up
and
two
hundred
and
men
and
officers
were
killed
when
the
people
of
the
united
states
heard
the
news
a
wave
of
anger
passed
over
the
land
but
the
president
was
calm
wait
he
said
wait
till
we
know
how
it
happened
so
grimly
the
people
waited
until
experts
made
an
examination
what
they
found
made
them
believe
that
the
maine
had
been
attacked
from
outside
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
the
spaniards
had
blown
up
the
vessel
although
they
indignantly
denied
having
had
anything
to
do
with
it
now
there
was
no
holding
the
people
and
very
shortly
war
was
declared
it
was
short
and
sharp
in
less
than
four
months
it
was
all
over
on
land
and
sea
the
spaniards
were
hopelessly
beaten
while
in
the
whole
campaign
the
americans
lost
scarcely
five
hundred
men
in
battle
although
more
than
twice
that
number
died
of
disease
the
war
was
fought
not
only
in
the
west
indies
but
also
in
the
pacific
for
there
spain
possessed
the
philippine
islands
these
islands
had
been
in
the
possession
of
spain
ever
since
their
discovery
by
magellan
more
than
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
and
they
had
been
called
the
philippines
after
king
philip
ii
of
spain
now
the
long
rule
of
spain
came
to
an
end
the
first
battle
of
the
war
was
fought
in
the
bay
of
manila
the
capital
of
the
philippine
islands
here
the
spanish
fleet
was
shattered
while
not
an
american
was
killed
a
month
or
two
later
the
town
of
manila
was
taken
and
the
philippines
were
in
the
power
of
the
americans
in
the
west
indies
too
the
spaniards
were
beaten
on
land
and
sea
and
on
august
she
sued
for
peace
by
the
treaty
of
peace
cuba
became
a
free
republic
while
porto
rico
and
all
the
other
spanish
islands
in
the
west
indies
were
given
to
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
philippines
but
no
sooner
was
the
treaty
signed
than
the
filipinos
rose
in
rebellion
against
american
rule
for
three
years
a
kind
of
irregular
war
went
on
then
the
leader
of
the
rebellion
aguinaldo
was
captured
and
after
that
the
filipinos
gradually
laid
down
their
arms
and
when
they
found
that
the
americans
did
not
mean
to
oppress
them
as
the
spaniards
had
done
they
became
more
content
with
their
rule
the
winning
of
these
foreign
possessions
brought
something
new
into
the
life
and
history
of
america
for
now
america
began
to
own
colonies
a
thing
quite
unlooked
for
and
not
altogether
welcome
to
many
at
this
time
also
besides
those
won
in
the
spanish
war
another
group
of
islands
came
under
american
rule
these
were
the
hawaiian
islands
also
like
the
philippines
in
the
pacific
ocean
hawaii
was
a
monarchy
but
for
a
long
time
the
people
had
been
discontented
and
queen
liliuokalani
was
the
last
royal
ruler
of
hawaii
she
wanted
to
be
an
absolute
monarch
and
do
what
she
liked
but
when
she
tried
to
change
the
constitution
to
her
liking
there
was
a
revolution
it
was
a
peaceful
revolution
and
not
a
shot
was
fired
on
either
side
it
was
brought
about
chiefly
by
the
white
people
who
lived
in
the
islands
a
company
of
marines
was
landed
from
the
united
states
cruiser
boston
which
happened
to
be
in
the
harbour
at
the
time
the
queen
was
deposed
and
a
provisional
government
set
up
stamford
dole
an
american
was
chosen
head
of
this
new
government
dole
then
sent
to
washington
to
ask
the
united
states
to
annex
hawaii
meanwhile
the
stars
and
stripes
were
hoisted
over
the
government
buildings
at
honolulu
the
capital
of
hawaii
all
this
happened
just
at
the
end
of
harrison
presidency
he
and
his
advisers
were
quite
willing
to
annex
hawaii
but
before
the
matter
could
be
settled
his
term
of
office
ended
and
cleveland
took
his
place
the
new
president
did
not
feel
at
all
pleased
with
what
had
been
done
and
he
sent
a
commissioner
to
honolulu
to
find
out
exactly
what
had
happened
and
if
the
people
really
wanted
to
be
annexed
to
the
united
states
this
commissioner
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hawaiians
did
not
want
to
be
annexed
and
that
a
great
wrong
had
been
done
to
a
feeble
but
independent
state
cleveland
therefore
refused
to
annex
the
islands
he
even
offered
to
restore
the
queen
to
her
throne
if
she
would
promise
to
forgive
all
those
who
had
helped
to
dethrone
her
at
first
she
would
not
promise
this
but
declared
that
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
must
be
beheaded
in
the
end
however
she
gave
way
i
must
not
feel
vengeful
to
any
of
my
people
she
said
if
i
am
restored
by
the
united
states
i
must
forget
myself
and
remember
only
my
dear
people
and
my
country
i
must
forgive
and
forget
the
past
permitting
no
punishment
of
any
one
but
when
dole
was
asked
to
give
up
the
islands
he
refused
he
and
his
party
were
ready
to
fight
rather
than
allow
the
queen
to
be
set
again
upon
the
throne
and
seeing
him
thus
determined
president
cleveland
gave
up
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
queen
so
for
several
years
hawaii
remained
a
little
independent
republic
with
dole
as
president
then
when
mckinley
came
into
power
the
united
states
was
again
asked
to
take
the
islands
under
protection
and
in
july
while
the
spanish
war
was
being
fought
hawaii
was
annexed
and
with
solemn
ceremony
the
flag
was
once
more
hoisted
in
honolulu
a
few
years
later
the
islands
were
made
a
territory
so
the
people
are
now
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
send
a
representative
to
congress
no
president
perhaps
grew
in
the
love
of
the
people
as
mckinley
did
at
the
end
of
his
four
years
office
he
was
loved
far
more
than
he
had
been
at
the
beginning
and
he
was
easily
elected
a
second
time
and
but
a
few
months
of
his
second
term
had
passed
when
people
began
to
talk
of
electing
him
a
third
time
but
when
mckinley
heard
of
it
he
was
vexed
he
told
the
people
that
they
must
put
such
an
idea
out
of
their
heads
for
he
would
not
be
a
candidate
for
a
third
term
on
any
consideration
all
i
want
he
said
is
to
serve
through
my
second
term
in
a
way
acceptable
to
my
countrymen
and
then
go
on
doing
my
duty
as
a
private
citizen
but
alas
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
even
to
serve
out
his
second
term
only
six
months
of
it
had
gone
when
he
went
to
visit
the
great
exhibition
at
buffalo
here
he
made
a
speech
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
changing
his
ideas
about
high
tariffs
and
that
it
was
time
now
he
thought
to
lower
them
next
day
he
held
a
great
reception
in
one
of
the
buildings
of
the
exhibition
crowds
of
all
sorts
of
people
streamed
into
the
hall
eager
to
see
the
president
and
shake
hands
with
him
among
these
came
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
have
hurt
his
hand
for
it
was
covered
with
a
handkerchief
the
man
came
quite
close
to
the
president
who
held
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
then
quickly
the
man
fired
two
shots
not
an
injured
hand
but
a
pistol
had
been
hidden
under
the
handkerchief
the
president
did
not
fall
he
walked
steadily
enough
to
a
chair
and
leant
his
head
upon
his
hand
you
are
wounded
said
his
secretary
ho
i
think
not
i
am
not
much
hurt
replied
the
president
but
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
with
pain
blood
flowed
from
his
wounds
yet
in
his
pain
he
thought
only
of
others
his
first
thought
was
for
his
wife
who
was
an
invalid
do
let
her
know
he
said
but
he
thought
too
of
the
wretched
man
who
had
shot
him
do
hurt
him
he
murmured
at
first
it
was
thought
that
the
wounds
were
not
fatal
and
that
the
president
would
recover
but
just
as
every
one
believed
that
the
danger
was
over
his
strength
seemed
to
fail
him
and
in
little
more
than
a
week
he
died
there
was
such
a
shining
goodness
and
honesty
about
president
mckinley
that
all
who
came
near
him
loved
and
respected
him
now
he
went
to
his
last
mourned
not
only
by
his
own
people
but
by
great
britain
and
nearly
every
country
in
europe
besides
even
his
murderer
had
no
special
hatred
of
mckinley
he
was
an
anarchist
who
believed
it
was
a
good
deed
to
kill
any
ruler
so
in
the
midst
of
his
usefulness
a
good
man
was
ruthlessly
slain
chapter
roosevelt
taft
upon
mckinley
death
theodore
roosevelt
the
became
president
he
was
the
youngest
of
all
the
presidents
being
only
when
he
came
into
office
roosevelt
was
in
the
mountains
with
his
wife
and
children
when
the
news
that
the
president
was
dying
was
brought
to
him
at
nine
at
night
he
started
off
on
a
long
drive
of
miles
to
the
railway
station
the
road
was
narrow
and
steep
and
full
of
mudholes
and
the
drive
through
the
darkness
was
one
of
danger
a
little
after
five
in
the
morning
the
station
was
reached
here
a
special
train
was
waiting
which
carried
the
to
buffalo
as
fast
as
might
be
but
he
was
too
late
to
see
his
president
in
life
for
while
he
was
still
on
his
wild
drive
through
the
night
president
mckinley
had
passed
peacefully
to
his
last
rest
roosevelt
was
the
youngest
of
all
presidents
and
he
brought
to
the
white
house
a
youthful
energy
and
hustle
such
as
no
president
had
before
he
had
strong
opinions
to
which
he
never
hesitated
to
give
voice
and
perhaps
since
lincoln
no
president
had
been
so
much
a
dictator
perhaps
the
most
interesting
thing
in
roosevelt
presidency
was
the
beginning
of
the
panama
canal
you
remember
that
when
columbus
set
forth
upon
the
sea
of
darkness
his
idea
was
to
reach
the
east
by
sailing
west
and
to
this
day
of
his
death
he
imagined
that
he
had
reached
india
by
sailing
westward
but
soon
men
found
out
the
mistake
and
then
began
the
search
for
the
passages
by
which
they
might
sail
past
the
great
continent
and
so
reach
india
the
passage
however
proved
a
delusion
the
men
turned
their
attention
to
the
narrow
isthmus
by
which
the
two
vast
continents
of
north
and
south
america
are
joined
and
soon
the
idea
of
cutting
a
canal
through
this
narrow
barrier
began
to
be
talked
of
but
time
went
on
and
the
spaniards
who
held
sway
over
the
isthmus
did
no
more
than
talk
then
an
adventurous
scotsman
was
seized
with
the
idea
of
founding
a
colony
at
darien
he
meant
to
build
a
great
harbour
where
all
the
ships
of
the
world
would
come
merchandise
was
to
be
carried
across
the
isthmus
by
camels
and
soon
his
colony
would
be
the
key
of
all
the
commerce
of
the
world
such
was
his
golden
dream
but
it
ended
in
utter
failure
still
the
idea
grew
men
of
many
nations
began
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
building
the
canal
and
at
length
the
french
got
leave
from
the
government
of
columbia
and
work
on
the
canal
was
begun
but
after
working
for
many
years
the
french
gave
up
the
undertaking
which
was
far
more
difficult
and
had
cost
far
more
money
than
they
had
expected
meanwhile
the
americans
had
become
much
interested
in
the
scheme
and
they
had
begun
to
think
of
cutting
a
canal
through
the
isthmus
at
nicaragua
then
when
the
french
company
went
bankrupt
they
offered
to
sell
all
their
rights
to
the
canal
to
the
united
states
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
over
the
matter
for
some
people
thought
that
the
nicaragua
route
would
be
better
but
in
the
end
it
was
agreed
to
take
over
the
canal
already
begun
and
go
with
it
everything
was
arranged
when
the
colombian
senate
refused
to
sign
the
treaty
by
this
treaty
they
were
to
receive
ten
million
dollars
besides
a
yearly
rent
for
the
land
through
which
the
canal
ran
but
that
sum
seemed
to
them
now
too
small
and
they
refused
to
sign
the
treaty
unless
the
money
to
be
paid
down
should
be
increased
to
million
dollars
this
the
united
states
was
unwilling
to
do
everything
came
down
to
a
standstill
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
panama
scheme
would
have
to
be
given
up
when
suddenly
a
new
turn
was
given
to
affairs
for
the
people
of
panama
rose
in
rebellion
against
colombia
and
declared
themselves
a
republic
the
united
states
at
once
recognized
the
new
republic
and
before
a
month
had
passed
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
panama
was
drawn
up
and
signed
and
the
work
on
the
great
canal
was
begun
a
good
many
people
however
were
not
very
pleased
at
the
manner
in
which
the
struggle
had
been
ended
they
thought
that
the
united
states
ought
not
to
have
taken
the
part
of
rebels
in
such
haste
but
the
president
was
quite
satisfied
that
he
had
done
the
right
thing
and
that
it
would
have
been
base
not
to
help
the
new
republic
in
roosevelt
had
become
president
by
accident
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
tragedy
of
president
mckinley
death
he
would
not
have
come
into
power
and
the
thought
grieved
him
somewhat
so
when
he
was
again
elected
president
he
was
quite
pleased
for
now
he
felt
that
he
held
his
great
office
because
the
people
wanted
him
and
not
because
they
could
not
help
having
him
few
presidents
have
grown
so
much
in
popularity
after
coming
into
office
as
roosevelt
people
felt
he
was
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
he
was
known
as
teddy
who
is
the
head
of
the
government
a
little
girl
was
asked
roosevelt
was
the
reply
yes
but
what
is
his
official
title
teddy
answered
the
little
one
during
this
presidency
oklahoma
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
the
state
oklahoma
is
an
indian
word
meaning
redman
it
was
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
and
had
been
set
aside
as
an
indian
reservation
all
the
land
however
was
not
occupied
and
as
some
of
it
was
exceedingly
fertile
the
white
people
began
to
agitate
to
have
it
opened
to
them
so
at
length
the
indians
gave
up
their
claim
to
part
of
this
territory
in
return
for
a
sum
of
money
this
was
in
and
president
harrison
proclaimed
that
at
twelve
noon
on
the
of
april
the
land
would
be
opened
for
settlement
long
before
the
day
people
set
out
in
all
directions
to
the
borders
of
oklahoma
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
at
least
twenty
thousand
people
had
gathered
on
the
borders
and
as
soon
as
the
blowing
of
a
bugle
announced
that
the
hour
of
noon
had
struck
there
was
a
wild
rush
over
the
border
before
darkness
fell
whole
towns
were
staked
out
yet
there
was
not
enough
land
for
all
and
many
had
to
return
home
disappointed
the
population
of
oklahoma
went
up
with
a
bound
but
it
was
not
until
eighteen
years
later
in
september
that
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
state
in
william
taft
became
president
taft
had
been
governor
of
the
philippines
and
had
shown
great
tact
and
firmness
in
that
post
he
and
president
roosevelt
were
friends
and
roosevelt
did
all
he
could
to
further
his
election
during
taft
presidency
the
last
two
states
were
admitted
to
the
union
ever
since
the
civil
war
new
mexico
had
been
seeking
admission
as
a
state
and
at
one
time
it
was
proposed
to
call
this
state
lincoln
that
suggestion
however
came
to
nothing
and
some
years
later
it
was
proposed
to
admit
new
mexico
and
arizona
as
one
state
to
this
arizona
objected
and
at
length
they
were
admitted
as
separate
states
new
mexico
on
the
of
january
and
arizona
on
the
of
february
both
these
states
were
made

chapter
wilson
troubles
with

in
taft
term
of
office
came
to
an
end
and
woodrow
wilson
was
elected
president
he
came
into
office
at
no
easy
time
at
home
many
things
needed
reform
and
on
the
borders
there
was
trouble
for
two
years
the
republic
of
mexico
which
had
always
been
a
troublous
neighbor
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
anarchy
one
revolution
followed
another
battles
and
bloodshed
became
common
events
many
americans
had
settled
in
mexico
and
in
the
turmoil
american
lives
were
lost
and
american
property
ruined
while
taft
was
in
office
he
tried
to
protect
the
americans
in
mexico
but
he
could
do
little
as
the
mexicans
made
it
plain
that
any
interference
on
the
part
of
america
would
mean
war
taft
avoided
war
but
the
state
of
things
in
mexico
went
from
bad
to
worse
and
when
wilson
became
president
a
settlement
with
mexico
was
one
of
the
problems
he
had
to
face
but
first
of
all
the
new
president
turned
this
thoughts
to
home
matters
ever
since
the
mckinley
tariff
the
duties
on
goods
imported
into
the
country
had
remained
high
many
people
however
had
come
to
believe
that
high
tariffs
were
a
mistake
for
while
they
enriched
a
few
they
made
living
dearer
than
need
be
for
many
these
people
wished
to
have
tariffs
for
revenue
only
that
is
they
thought
duties
should
only
be
high
enough
to
produce
sufficient
income
for
the
needs
of
the
government
they
objected
to
tariffs
merely
for
protection
that
is
they
objected
to
tariffs
which
protected
the
manufacturer
at
the
expense
of
the
consumer
president
wilson
held
these
opinions
strongly
and
during
the
first
year
of
his
presidency
a
bill
was
passed
by
which
were
luxuries
things
which
only
rich
people
bought
were
heavily
taxed
while
the
taxes
on
foodstuffs
and
wool
things
which
the
poorest
need
were
made
much
lighter
these
changes
in
the
tariff
brought
in
much
less
income
for
the
government
and
to
make
up
for
the
loss
an
income
tax
was
levied
for
the
first
time
everyone
who
had
more
than
dollars
a
year
having
to
pay
it
in
this
way
again
the
burden
of
taxes
was
shifted
from
the
poor
to
the
rich
the
president
next
turned
his
attention
to
the
banks
little
change
had
been
made
in
their
way
of
doing
business
since
the
civil
war
and
for
some
time
it
had
been
felt
that
to
meet
the
growing
needs
of
trade
a
change
was
wanted
many
people
had
tried
to
think
out
a
new
system
but
it
was
not
easy
and
they
failed
wilson
however
succeeded
and
in
december
the
currency
bill
was
passed
it
would
take
too
long
and
would
be
rather
difficult
to
explain
just
what
this
act
was
shortly
it
was
meant
to
keep
too
much
money
from
getting
into
the
hands
of
a
few
people
and
to
give
every
one
with
energy
and
enterprise
a
chance
other
acts
connected
with
the
trade
of
the
country
followed
these
all
of
which
intended
to
make
the
life
of
the
weak
and
poor
easier
of
these
perhaps
the
most
interesting
for
us
is
the
child
labour
act
this
act
was
meant
to
keep
people
from
making
young
children
work
too
hard
and
in
order
to
make
child
labour
less
profitable
to
exploiters
the
act
forbids
the
sending
of
goods
made
by
children
under
fourteen
from
one
state
to
another
if
the
children
are
obliged
to
work
at
night
or
for
more
than
eight
hours
during
the
day
the
age
is
raised
to
sixteen
this
act
was
signed
in
september
but
did
not
come
into
force
until
september
while
these
things
were
being
done
within
the
country
troubles
beyond
its
boarders
were
increasing
first
there
was
trouble
with
mexico
a
few
days
before
wilson
was
inaugurated
madero
the
president
of
mexico
was
deposed
and
murdered
and
a
rebel
leader
named
huerta
at
once
proclaimed
himself
president
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murder
of
madero
has
never
been
openly
proved
but
wilson
believing
that
he
had
looked
upon
him
as
an
assassin
and
refused
to
acknowledge
him
as
head
of
the
neighboring
republic
but
beyond
that
wilson
hesitated
to
mix
himself
or
his
country
in
the
mexican
quarrel
believing
that
the
mexicans
themselves
could
best
settle
their
own
affairs
shall
we
deny
to
mexico
he
asked
a
little
later
because
she
is
weak
the
right
to
settle
her
own
affairs
no
i
say
i
am
proud
to
belong
to
a
great
nation
that
says
country
which
we
could
crush
shall
have
as
much
freedom
in
her
own
affairs
as
we
have
in
ours
whether
the
president
was
wise
or
unwise
in
his
dealings
with
mexico
we
can
not
say
the
trouble
is
too
close
to
us
it
is
not
settled
yet
but
the
one
thing
we
can
clearly
see
is
that
wilson
loved
and
desired
peace
not
only
with
mexico
but
with
the
whole
of
america
he
wanted
to
unite
the
whole
of
america
both
north
and
south
in
bonds
of
kindness
he
wanted
to
make
the
small
weak
republics
of
south
america
feel
that
the
great
republic
of
north
america
was
a
watchful
friend
and
not
a
watchful
enemy
eager
and
able
when
she
chose
to
crush
them
had
the
united
states
put
forth
her
strength
mexico
could
have
been
conquered
doubtless
in
no
long
time
but
wilson
took
a
wider
view
than
those
who
counseled
such
a
course
instead
of
crushing
mexico
and
thereby
perhaps
arousing
the
jealousy
and
suspicion
of
other
weak
republics
he
tried
to
use
the
trouble
to
increase
the
good
will
of
these
republics
toward
the
united
states
he
tried
to
show
them
that
the
united
states
was
one
with
them
and
had
no
desire
to
enlarge
her
borders
at
the
expense
of
another
whether
the
means
he
used
were
wise
or
not
time
will
show
for
the
most
part
the
country
was
with
the
president
in
his
desire
to
keep
out
of
war
with
mexico
this
was
partly
because
they
believed
that
america
was
not
prepared
for
war
partly
because
they
knew
that
war
must
certainly
end
in
the
defeat
of
the
mexicans
having
defeated
them
the
united
states
would
be
forced
to
annex
their
territory
and
this
no
one
wanted
but
to
keep
out
of
war
was
no
easy
matter
the
wild
disorder
in
mexico
increased
daily
besides
huerta
other
claimants
for
the
presidency
appeared
and
the
country
swarmed
with
bandit
forces
under
various
leaders
all
fighting
against
each
other
at
length
in
april
some
united
states
sailors
who
had
landed
at
the
mexican
port
of
tampico
were
taken
prisoner
by
the
huertists
they
were
soon
set
free
again
but
huerta
refused
to
apologize
in
a
satisfactory
way
and
an
american
squadron
was
sent
to
take
possession
of
vera
cruz
war
seemed
now
certain
but
it
was
averted
and
after
holding
vera
cruz
for
more
than
seven
months
the
american
troops
were
withdrawn
we
do
not
want
to
fight
the
mexicans
said
wilson
at
the
funeral
of
the
sailors
who
lost
their
lives
in
the
attack
we
do
not
want
to
fight
the
mexicans
we
want
to
serve
them
if
we
can
a
war
of
aggression
is
not
a
proud
thing
in
which
to
die
but
a
war
of
service
is
one
in
which
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
die
on
the
invitation
of
the
united
states
three
of
the
south
american
republics
argentina
brazil
and
chile
known
from
their
names
as
the
a
powers
now
joined
with
the
united
states
in
trying
to
settle
the
mexican
difficulty
in
may
they
held
a
mediation
conference
at
niagara
falls
in
canada
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
the
disorder
in
mexico
continued
as
before
in
july
however
there
seemed
some
hope
of
a
settlement
huerta
fled
to
europe
leaving
his
friend
francisco
carbajal
as
president
for
a
month
carbajal
kept
his
post
then
anarchy
worse
than
ever
broke
loose
three
men
carranza
villa
and
zapata
each
declaring
themselves
president
filled
the
land
with
bloodshed
and
ruin
once
again
on
the
invitation
of
the
united
states
south
america
intervened
delegates
from
six
south
american
republics
meeting
at
washington
to
consider
what
could
be
done
to
bring
peace
to
the
distracted
country
they
decided
to
give
the
mexicans
three
months
in
which
to
settle
their
quarrels
and
warned
them
that
if
by
that
time
order
was
not
restored
united
america
would
be
forced
to
take
action
soon
after
this
however
carranza
succeeded
in
subduing
his
rivals
to
a
certain
extent
and
got
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
the
country
the
united
states
therefore
recognized
him
as
president
of
mexico
and
very
shortly
many
of
the
european
powers
did
the
same
it
seemed
as
if
peace
might
really
come
at
last
to
mexico
but
although
villa
was
worsted
he
was
by
to
means
crushed
and
he
and
his
undisciplined
followers
still
kept
the
country
in
a
state
of
unrest
doing
many
deeds
of
violence
in
january
these
marauding
troops
seized
and
murdered
a
party
of
americans
a
little
later
they
crossed
frontiers
and
were
only
driven
back
after
a
sharp
encounter
with
united
states
troops
this
brigandage
had
to
be
stopped
and
as
carranza
seemed
unable
to
subdue
the
rebels
five
thousand
american
troops
entered
mexico
intent
on
punishing
villa
and
his
bandits
but
the
task
was
no
easy
one
villa
was
well
suited
to
be
a
bandit
leader
and
he
was
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
wild
and
mountainous
country
the
americans
however
pressed
him
hard
and
a
battle
was
fought
in
which
he
was
believed
for
a
time
to
have
been
killed
soon
however
he
was
discovered
to
be
alive
and
as
aggressive
as
before
meanwhile
president
carranza
had
grown
restless
and
suspicious
of
american
interferences
and
demanded
that
the
united
states
troops
should
be
withdrawn
from
mexican
soil
indeed
he
became
so
threatening
that
wilson
called
out
the
militia
and
ordered
a
squadron
of
war
vessels
to
mexican
waters
scarcely
was
this
done
when
the
news
reached
washington
that
a
skirmish
had
taken
place
between
mexican
and
united
states
troops
in
which
forty
had
been
killed
and
seventeen
taken
prisoners
war
was
now
certain
but
once
more
it
was
averted
carranza
set
his
prisoners
free
and
proposed
that
the
two
republics
should
settle
their
differences
by
arbitration
to
this
wilson
agreed
and
in
the
beginning
of
september
a
commission
composed
of
delegates
from
both
countries
came
together
the
commission
suggested
that
both
mexico
and
the
united
states
should
work
together
to
patrol
the
frontiers
and
safeguard
them
from
further
raids
but
to
this
carranza
would
not
agree
and
in
february
the
united
states
troops
were
withdrawn
and
mexico
was
once
more
left
to
save
herself
chapter

the
disorder
in
mexico
was
distressing
to
america
it
was
disastrous
to
the
mexicans
themselves
but
the
effect
of
america
as
a
whole
was
slight
while

at

it
scarcely
at
all
in

while

was
still
grave

this

to

was

had
refused
to
draw
sword
even
in
aid
of
the
friend
who
only
a
few
years
before
had
helped
americans
so
generously
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
he
was
wise
for
in
those
days
america
was
weak
she
was
the
youngest
of
the
world
great
nations
she
had
hardly
found
herself
had
she
mixed
herself
in
the
european
quarrel
she
would
have
suffered
greatly
perhaps
might
even
have
lost
her
freedom
all
this
washington
knew
gratitude
was
due
to
france
but
not
useless
sacrifice
which
would
merely
bring
ruin
on
america
and
help
france
not
at
all
so
washington
declared
for
neutrality
and
maintained
it
thirty
years
later
monroe
announced
his
famous
doctrine
that
doctrine
in
the
words
of
henry
jefferson
was
first
never
to
entangle
ourselves
in
the
broils
of
europe
second
never
to
suffer
europe
to
intermeddle
with
affairs
to
that
doctrine
america
has
remained
faithful
but
in
the
ninety
years
which
have
passed
since
it
was
first
announced
many
changes
have
taken
place
america
is
no
longer
weak
but
grown
to
giant
strength
great
among
the
great
the
trade
of
europe
and
the
trade
of
america
have
become
interlocked
discoveries
and
inventions
the
wonders
of
steam
and
electricity
have
made
light
of
the
broad
atlantic
today
men
come
and
go
from
the
one
continent
to
the
other
with
greater
ease
than
a
hundred
years
ago
they
went
from
boston
to
washington
by
a
thousand
ties
of
commerce
and
of
brotherhood
the
old
world
is
bound
to
the
new
so
the
war
cloud
which
darkened
europe
cast
its
shadow
also
over
america
even
although
at
first
there
was
no
thought
that
america
would
be
drawn
into
the
war
was
it
possible
men
asked
while
europe
was
at
death
grips
for
america
still
to
keep
her
splendid
isolation
was
it
not
time
for
her
to
take
a
place
in
the
parliament
of
man
in
the
federation
of
the
world
the
ties
which
bind
america
to
europe
bind
her
to
no
one
country
but
to
all
bind
her
equally
it
would
seem
to
france
britain
and
germany
the
first
founders
of
the
republic
were
of
british
stock
but
with
the
passing
years
millions
of
germans
have
found
a
home
within
her
hospitable
borders
together
with
natives
of
every
nation
at
war
how
then
could
america
take
sides
no
matter
which
side
she
took
it
seemed
almost
certain
to
lead
to
civil
war
at
home
so
on
the
of
august
wilson
proclaimed
the
neutrality
of
the
united
states
to
the
great
bulk
of
the
nation
this
seemed
wise
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
loves
and
desires
peace
and
realizes
the
madness
and
uselessness
of
war
indeed
america
more
than
the
nations
of
the
old
world
has
come
to
see
the
war
is
an
way
of
settling
quarrels
but
although
the
united
states
might
proclaim
her
neutrality
she
was
none
the
less
entangled
in
the
war
germany
declared
a
blockage
of
britain
britain
declared
a
blockage
of
germany
and
these
orders
in
council
had
a
far
greater
effect
on
american
trade
than
the
berlin
decrees
and
the
orders
in
council
in
the
day
of
napoleon
difficulties
arose
with
both
countries
but
the
difficulties
which
arose
with
britain
were
such
as
wise
statesmanship
might
allay
they
were
concerned
with
such
things
as
the
censoring
of
mails
and
other
irritating
delays
which
interfered
with
and
caused
loss
of
trade
with
germany
the
difficulties
were
of
a
far
more
serious
order
and
soon
all
sane
and
freedom
loving
men
found
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
remain
neutral
in
spirit
the
german
cause
had
never
been
a
good
one
no
danger
threatened
the
country
no
european
nation
desired
to
make
war
upon
them
they
went
to
war
wantonly
and
without
just
cause
soon
it
became
plain
that
they
meant
to
wage
war
with
a
ruthlessness
and
inhumanity
the
world
had
never
known
they
threw
to
the
winds
all
the
laws
of
fair
play
treaties
became
for
them
mere
scraps
of
paper
to
be
torn
if
necessity
demanded
they
marched
through
belgium
murdering
and
torturing
the
people
wantonly
destroying
the
splendid
buildings
which
had
been
the
country
glory
and
pride
zeppelins
attacked
watering
places
and
fishing
villages
ruining
peaceful
homes
slaying
women
and
children
without
reason
or
profit
submarines
waged
ruthless
war
on
the
seas
attacking
alike
traders
passenger
vessels
or
hospital
ships
belligerent
or
neutral
without
distinction
as
outrage
followed
outrage
the
whole
world
was
filled
with
horror
and
one
by
one
germany
friends
turned
from
her
estranged
by
her
deeds
of
violence
these
were
days
as
wilson
said
to
try
men
souls
and
the
burden
of
guiding
the
ship
of
state
through
the
sea
of
difficulties
lay
heavy
upon
him
at
home
and
abroad
his
critics
were
many
some
praised
him
because
he
kept
the
nation
steadfastly
on
the
difficult
path
of
peace
others
blamed
him
because
it
seemed
to
them
he
did
not
sufficiently
uphold
american
honour
and
submitted
to
german
insults
rather
than
draw
the
sword
no
great
man
in
a
difficult
hour
can
escape
criticism
few
in
any
can
escape
mistakes
amid
the
clash
of
opinions
one
thing
was
clear
that
wilson
was
a
patriot
and
when
in
the
time
came
to
choose
a
president
he
was
for
a
second
term
of
four
years
in
march
the
president
entered
upon
his
new
term
of
office
well
aware
that
a
hard
road
lay
before
him
and
his
country
as
he
took
the
oath
he
opened
and
kissed
the
bible
at
the
passage
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
his
address
was
imbued
with
a
sense
of
the
dread
solemnity
of
the
times
i
stand
here
and
have
taken
the
high
solemn
oath
he
said
because
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
chosen
me
and
by
their
gracious
judgement
have
named
me
their
leader
in
affairs
i
know
now
what
the
task
means
i
pray
god
that
i
be
given
wisdom
and
prudence
to
do
my
duty
in
the
true
spirit
of
this
great
people
i
am
their
servant
and
can
succeed
only
as
they
sustain
and
guide
me
by
their
confidence
and
their
counsel
the
shadows
that
now
lie
dark
upon
our
path
will
soon
be
dispelled
we
shall
walk
with
light
all
about
us
if
we
be
but
true
to
ourselves
as
we
have
wished
to
be
known
in
the
counsels
of
the
world
in
the
thought
of
all
those
who
love
liberty
justice
and
right
exalted
we
can
not
here
follow
in
detail
all
the
steps
by
which
germany
forced
america
at
length
to
declare
war
it
was
in
a
spirit
of
service
that
wilson
took
up
his
office
for
a
second
time
of
service
not
only
to
his
own
country
but
to
the
world
in
the
cause
of
that
service
he
saw
himself
forced
to
lead
his
country
into
war
germany
had
filled
america
with
spies
plotting
constantly
against
her
peace
and
her
honour
she
had
run
amuck
upon
the
seas
and
by
her
submarine
warfare
endangered
the
lives
and
welfare
of
all
mankind
she
had
become
a
menace
to
the
world
freedom
the
president
loves
peace
even
as
the
soul
of
america
loves
peace
but
both
president
and
people
became
at
length
convinced
that
the
only
way
to
restore
peace
to
the
world
was
to
defeat
the
authors
of
the
war
having
arrived
at
this
grave
conclusion
there
was
no
turning
back
and
on
the
april
wilson
announced
his
decision
at
a
joint
session
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
it
was
not
lightly
undertaken
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
lead
this
great
peaceful
people
into
war
into
the
most
terrible
and
disastrous
of
all
wars
civilization
itself
seeming
to
be
in
the
balance
but
the
right
is
more
precious
than
peace
and
we
shall
fight
for
the
things
which
we
have
always
carried
nearest
our
hearts
for
democracy
for
the
right
of
those
who
submit
to
authority
to
have
a
voice
in
their
own
governments
for
the
rights
and
liberties
of
small
nations
for
a
universal
dominion
of
right
by
such
a
concert
of
free
peoples
as
shall
bring
peace
and
safety
to
all
nations
and
make
the
world
itself
at
last
free
to
such
a
task
we
can
dedicate
our
lives
and
our
fortunes
everything
that
we
are
and
everything
that
we
have
with
the
pride
of
those
who
know
that
the
day
has
come
when
america
is
privileged
to
spend
her
blood
and
her
might
for
the
principles
that
gave
her
birth
and
happiness
and
the
peace
which
she
has
treasured
god
helping
her
she
can
do
no
other
in
these
noble
words
the
president
of
the
united
states
threw
down
the
gauge
of
battle
there
was
in
his
heart
no
rancour
against
the
german
people
but
only
a
righteous
wrath
against
her
criminal
rulers
who
for
their
own
selfish
ends
had
plunged
the
world
in
misery
never
in
the
world
history
has
a
great
nation
gone
to
war
in
so
chivalrous
a
spirit
for
so
unselfish
ends
we
have
no
selfish
ends
to
serve
said
the
president
we
desire
no
conquest
no
dominion
we
seek
no
indemnities
for
ourselves
no
material
compensation
for
the
sacrifices
we
shall
freely
make
we
are
but
one
of
the
champions
of
the
rights
of
mankind
we
shall
be
satisfied
when
those
rights
have
been
made
as
secure
as
the
faith
and
the
freedom
of
nations
can
make
them
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
president
but
he
spoke
from
the
heart
of
the
people
brought
together
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
speaking
many
tongues
worshiping
god
in
many
ways
diverse
in
character
and
in
custom
the
nation
which
stands
behind
the
president
is
one
in
heart
in
the
fiery
trail
of
battle
america
has
found
her
soul
and
the
american
by
adoption
has
proved
himself
as
truly
a
citizen
of
the
country
as
the
american
by
birth
divided
by
birth
and
language
by
religion
and
custom
they
are
one
in
soul
one
in
their
desire
to
dedicate
themselves
to
the
great
unselfish
task
they
have
taken
in
hand
one
in
the
zeal
of
sacrifice
who
can
say
what
days
of
terror
and
splendour
the
future
may
hold
as
i
write
it
lies
before
us
a
blacker
sea
of
darkness
and
adventure
than
that
columbus
crossed
but
it
would
seem
that
for
the
great
republic
it
can
hold
no
diviner
hour
than
this
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
there
could
be
found
no
more
splendid
close
to
a
splendid
story
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
glory
of
the
coming
of
the
lord
he
is
trampling
out
the
vintage
where
the
grapes
of
wrath
are
stored
he
hath
loosed
the
fateful
lightning
of
his
terrible
swift
sword
his
truth
is
marching
on
he
has
sounded
forth
the
trumpet
that
shall
never
call
retreat
he
is
sifting
out
the
hearts
of
men
before
his
judgment
seat
o
be
swift
my
soul
to
answer
him
be
jubilant
my
feet
our
god
is
marching
on
in
the
beauty
of
the
lilies
christ
was
born
across
the
sea
with
a
glory
in
his
bosom
that
transfigures
you
and
me
as
he
died
to
make
men
holy
let
us
die
to
make
me
free
while
god
is
marching
on
