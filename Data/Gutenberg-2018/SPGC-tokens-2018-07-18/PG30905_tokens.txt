both
girls
gasped
and
stared
incredulously
a
flight
of
stairs
could
be
dimly
discerned
they
stared
with
the
fascination
of
horror
well
what
do
you
suppose
that
can
be
queried
cynthia
do
you
know
any
real
elderly
people
father
oh
i
wish
i
were
sherlock
holmes
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sit
and
enjoy
the
spectacle
then
with
one
accord
they
began
to
steer
their
way
around
the
furniture
chapter
i
goliath
leads
the
way
cynthia
sat
on
her
veranda
steps
chin
in
hand
gazing
dolefully
at
the
gray
september
sky
all
day
up
to
half
an
hour
before
the
sky
had
been
cloudlessly
blue
the
day
warm
and
radiant
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
sun
had
slunk
shamefacedly
behind
a
high
rising
bank
of
cloud
and
its
retiring
had
been
accompanied
by
a
raw
chilly
wind
cynthia
scowled
then
she
shivered
then
she
pulled
the
collar
of
her
white
sweater
up
to
her
ears
and
buttoned
it
over
then
she
muttered
something
about
wishing
joy
would
hurry
for
it
going
to
rain
then
she
dug
her
hands
into
her
sweater
pockets
and
stared
across
the
lawn
at
a
blue
hydrangea
bush
with
a
single
remaining
bunch
of
blossoms
hanging
heavy
on
its
stem
suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
red
on
a
veranda
farther
down
the
street
and
a
long
musical
whistle
cynthia
jumped
up
and
waved
madly
the
flash
of
red
speeding
toward
her
developed
into
a
bright
red
sweater
cap
and
skirt
do
scold
now
you
must
be
cross
cynthia
anne
was
just
putting
a
big
batch
of
in
the
oven
and
i
simply
to
wait
till
they
were
done
i
brought
a
lot
over
for
you
here
the
owner
of
the
red
sweater
crammed
a
handful
of
hot
cookies
into
cynthia
pocket
you
did
keep
me
waiting
an
age
joy
cynthia
began
struggling
with
a
mouthful
of
cooky
but
i
forgive
you
i
almost
begun
to
be
angry
joy
her
right
name
was
joyce
ignored
the
latter
remark
we
ca
go
momsie
positively
forbade
it
why
on
earth
could
it
have
kept
sunny
a
little
longer
it
rain
any
minute
now
i
suppose
i
know
cynthia
sympathized
mother
forbade
me
too
long
before
you
came
out
and
we
counted
on
it
so
wo
be
much
more
chance
to
go
canoeing
season
they
sat
down
listlessly
on
the
veranda
steps
and
solaced
themselves
with
the
last
remnants
of
the
cookies
life
appeared
a
trifle
drab
as
it
usually
does
when
cherished
plans
are
demolished
and
the
sun
goes
in
very
shortly
there
were
no
more
cookies
what
on
earth
has
happened
to
your
hydrangea
bush
it
was
full
of
blossoms
yesterday
joyce
suddenly
exclaimed
bates
pup
replied
cynthia
laconically
there
was
no
need
of
further
explanation
joyce
giggled
at
its
shorn
appearance
and
then
relapsed
into
another
long
silence
there
were
times
when
these
two
companions
could
talk
frantically
for
hours
on
a
stretch
there
were
other
seasons
when
they
would
sit
silent
yet
utterly
understanding
one
another
for
equally
prolonged
periods
they
had
been
bosom
friends
from
babyhood
as
their
parents
had
been
before
them
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
had
gone
through
kindergarten
and
together
and
were
now
abreast
in
their
first
year
even
their
birthdays
fell
in
the
same
month
and
the
only
period
of
the
year
which
saw
them
parted
was
the
few
weeks
during
vacation
when
their
respective
parents
who
had
different
tastes
in
summer
resorts
dragged
them
unwillingly
away
to
mountain
and
literally
nothing
else
ever
separated
them
save
the
walls
of
their
own
dwellings
and
the
house
it
is
now
high
time
to
introduce
the
house
which
has
been
staring
us
out
of
countenance
ever
since
this
story
began
for
the
matter
of
that
it
had
stared
the
two
girls
out
of
countenance
ever
since
they
came
to
live
in
the
little
town
of
rockridge
one
on
each
side
of
it
and
long
before
they
came
there
long
before
ever
they
were
born
or
rockridge
had
begun
its
mushroom
growth
as
a
pretty
modern
country
town
the
house
had
stared
the
out
of
countenance
with
almost
irritating
persistence
it
was
set
well
back
from
the
street
in
a
big
inclosure
guarded
by
a
very
rickety
and
a
gate
that
was
never
shut
but
hung
loosely
on
one
hinge
unkempt
bushes
and
tall
rank
grass
flourished
in
this
inclosure
and
near
the
porch
grew
two
like
sentinels
at
the
entrance
at
the
back
was
a
small
orchard
of
ancient
and
near
the
rear
door
a
with
the
great
sweep
half
rotted
away
the
house
itself
was
a
big
rambling
affair
of
the
colonial
type
with
three
tall
pillars
supporting
the
veranda
roof
and
reaching
above
the
second
story
on
each
side
of
the
main
part
was
a
generous
wing
it
stood
rather
high
on
a
sloping
lawn
and
we
have
said
that
it
stared
at
with
truth
because
very
near
the
roof
were
two
little
windows
shaped
like
they
somehow
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
a
pair
of
eyes
that
stared
and
stared
and
with
calm
unwinking
blankness
as
to
the
other
windows
and
doors
they
were
all
tightly
boarded
up
the
boards
in
the
big
front
door
had
a
small
door
fashioned
in
them
and
this
door
fastened
with
a
very
rusty
lock
no
one
ever
came
in
or
out
no
one
ever
tended
the
grounds
the
place
had
been
without
an
occupant
for
years
the
house
had
always
been
boarded
up
as
long
as
its
neighbors
could
recollect
it
was
not
advertised
for
sale
when
the
little
town
of
rockridge
began
to
build
up
people
speculated
about
it
for
a
while
with
considerable
interest
but
as
they
could
never
obtain
any
definite
information
about
it
they
finally
gave
it
up
and
accepted
the
queer
old
place
as
a
matter
of
course
to
cynthia
sprague
and
joyce
kenway
it
had
when
they
first
came
to
live
on
either
side
of
it
some
five
years
before
afforded
for
a
while
an
endless
source
of
attraction
they
had
played
house
on
the
broad
veranda
climbed
the
trees
in
the
orchard
organized
elaborate
games
of
among
the
thick
high
bushes
that
grew
so
close
to
the
walls
and
in
idle
moments
had
told
each
other
long
stories
about
its
former
imaginary
inmates
but
as
they
grew
older
and
more
absorbed
in
outside
affairs
their
interest
in
it
ceased
till
at
length
it
came
to
be
only
a
source
of
irritation
to
them
since
it
separated
their
homes
by
a
wide
space
that
they
considered
rather
a
nuisance
to
have
to
traverse
so
they
sat
on
this
threatening
afternoon
cheated
of
their
anticipated
on
the
little
stream
that
threaded
its
way
through
their
town
to
the
wide
sound
sat
munching
glowering
at
the
weather
and
thinking
of
nothing
very
special
suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
gray
across
the
lawn
closely
pursued
by
a
streak
of
yellow
both
girls
sprang
to
their
feet
joyce
exclaiming
indignantly
look
at
bates
pup
chasing
goliath
the
latter
individual
was
the
kenways
huge
maltese
cat
well
deserving
of
his
name
in
appearance
but
not
in
nature
for
he
was
known
to
be
the
biggest
coward
in
the
girls
stood
on
tiptoe
to
watch
the
chase
over
the
lawn
and
through
an
opening
in
the
of
the
house
sped
goliath
his
enemy
yapping
at
his
heels
and
into
the
tangled
thicket
of
bushes
about
the
nearer
wing
into
the
bushes
also
plunged
bates
pup
and
there
ensued
the
sound
of
sundry
baffled
yelps
then
after
a
moment
bates
pup
emerged
one
ear
comically
cocked
and
ambled
away
in
search
of
other
entertainment
nothing
else
happened
and
the
girls
resumed
their
seat
on
the
veranda
steps
presently
joyce
remarked
idly
does
it
strike
you
as
queer
cynthia
what
could
have
become
of
goliath
not
at
all
replied
cynthia
who
had
no
special
gift
of
imagination
what
have
happened
to
him
i
suppose
he
climbed
into
the
bushes
he
could
have
done
that
without
being
in
reach
of
the
pup
retorted
joyce
and
he
could
have
come
out
either
side
or
we
have
seen
him
now
where
can
he
be
i
vote
we
go
and
look
him
up
she
had
begun
with
but
a
languid
interest
seeking
only
to
pass
the
time
and
had
suddenly
ended
up
with
tremendous
enthusiasm
that
was
like
joyce
i
do
see
what
you
want
to
do
that
for
argued
cynthia
i
care
what
became
of
him
as
long
as
he
got
away
from
bates
pup
and
very
comfortable
right
here
cynthia
was
large
and
fair
and
plump
and
inclined
to
be
a
little
indolent
but
do
you
see
insisted
joyce
that
he
must
have
hidden
in
some
strange
place
and
one
he
must
have
known
about
too
for
he
went
straight
to
it
i
just
curious
to
find
out
his
joyce
was
slim
and
dark
and
elfin
full
of
queer
pranks
sudden
enthusiastic
plans
and
very
vivid
of
imagination
a
curious
contrast
to
the
placid
cynthia
joyce
also
as
a
rule
had
her
way
in
matters
and
she
had
it
now
very
well
sighed
cynthia
in
slow
assent
come
on
they
wandered
down
the
steps
across
the
lawn
through
the
gap
in
the
fence
and
tried
to
part
the
bushes
behind
which
goliath
had
disappeared
but
they
were
thick
lilac
bushes
grown
high
and
rank
joyce
struggled
through
them
tearing
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
and
pulling
her
hair
awry
cynthia
prudently
remained
on
the
outskirts
the
quest
did
not
greatly
interest
her
there
nothing
back
there
but
the
foundation
of
the
house
she
remarked
you
wrong
there
is
called
back
joy
excitedly
from
the
depths
crawl
around
the
end
of
the
bushes
cyn
it
will
be
easier
i
want
to
show
you
something
there
was
so
much
suppressed
mystery
in
joy
voice
that
cynthia
obeyed
without
demur
and
back
of
the
bushes
found
her
examining
a
little
window
into
the
cellar
one
board
of
it
had
through
age
and
dampness
rotted
and
fallen
away
there
happened
to
be
no
glass
behind
it
here
where
goliath
disappeared
whispered
joyce
and
he
probably
in
there
now
cynthia
surveyed
the
hole
unconcernedly
that
so
she
agreed
he
will
probably
come
out
after
a
while
now
that
you
discovered
his
i
hope
you
coming
back
to
the
veranda
we
might
have
a
game
of
tennis
too
before
it
rains
joyce
sat
back
on
her
heels
and
looked
her
companion
straight
in
the
eye
cynthia
she
said
in
a
tense
whisper
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
there
something
about
the
house
no
declared
cynthia
honestly
it
never
did
i
never
thought
about
it
well
i
have
sometimes
at
least
and
once
in
a
long
while
do
you
know
i
even
dreamed
i
was
exploring
it
look
here
cynthia
you
to
explore
it
i
just
crazy
to
cynthia
stared
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
mercy
no
it
would
be
dark
and
musty
and
dirty
besides
we
no
business
in
there
we
be
trespassers
what
ever
made
you
think
of
it
there
probably
nothing
to
see
anyway
it
an
empty
house
that
just
where
you
mistaken
retorted
joyce
i
heard
father
say
once
that
it
was
furnished
throughout
and
left
exactly
as
it
was
so
some
one
told
him
some
old
lady
i
think
he
said
it
a
colonial
mansion
too
and
stood
here
before
the
revolution
there
was
any
town
of
rockridge
you
know
till
just
recently
only
the
turnpike
road
off
there
where
warrington
avenue
is
now
this
house
was
the
only
one
around
for
a
long
distance
well
that
sounds
interesting
but
even
still
i
do
see
why
you
want
to
get
inside
anyhow
i
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
outside
and
more
than
that
we
could
get
in
if
we
tried
so
there
if
cynthia
imagined
she
had
ended
the
argument
with
joyce
by
any
such
reasoning
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
joyce
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
disgusted
movement
i
never
saw
any
one
like
you
cynthia
sprague
you
absolutely
imagination
do
you
see
how
goliath
got
in
well
i
could
get
in
the
same
way
and
so
could
you
she
gave
the
boards
a
sharp
pull
and
succeeded
in
dislodging
another
five
minutes
work
will
clear
this
window
and
then
but
good
gracious
joy
you
would
break
in
a
window
of
a
strange
house
and
climb
in
the
cellar
like
a
burglar
cried
cynthia
genuinely
shocked
i
just
would
why
it
an
cynthia
like
the
kind
always
longed
for
you
know
we
always
said
we
love
to
have
some
adventures
above
everything
else
and
we
have
and
now
one
right
under
our
noses
joyce
was
almost
tearful
in
her
earnestness
to
convince
the
doubting
cynthia
and
then
cynthia
yielded
as
she
always
did
to
joy
entreaties
very
well
it
is
an
adventure
i
suppose
but
why
not
wait
till
some
bright
sunny
day
it
be
horridly
dark
and
gloomy
in
there
this
afternoon
nonsense
cried
joyce
who
never
could
bear
to
wait
an
instant
in
carrying
out
some
cherished
plan
run
back
to
your
house
cynthia
and
smuggle
out
a
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
and
let
any
one
see
what
you
take
but
this
cynthia
flatly
refused
to
do
urging
that
she
would
certainly
be
discovered
and
held
up
for
instant
explanation
by
the
bridget
who
guarded
the
kitchen
very
well
then
i
have
to
get
them
from
mine
i
suppose
anne
never
asks
what
i
doing
said
joyce
resignedly
you
stay
here
and
wait
she
sped
away
toward
her
own
house
but
was
soon
back
matches
and
candle
under
her
sweater
her
hands
full
of
fresh
cookies
we
eat
these
when
we
inside
here
stuff
them
into
your
pockets
and
help
me
break
these
other
boards
away
my
but
they
rotten
cynthia
helped
secretly
very
reluctant
and
fearful
of
consequences
and
they
soon
had
the
little
window
free
of
obstructions
joyce
poked
in
her
head
and
peered
about
it
as
dark
as
a
pocket
but
i
see
two
things
like
balls
of
fire
that
goliath
up
on
a
beam
i
suppose
it
is
far
to
the
ground
here
goes
she
slipped
in
feet
first
let
herself
down
hung
on
to
the
sill
a
moment
then
disappeared
from
view
oh
joyce
gasped
cynthia
sticking
her
head
through
the
opening
into
the
dark
where
you
right
here
laughed
joyce
from
below
trying
to
light
the
candle
come
along
the
stones
of
the
wall
are
like
regular
steps
you
can
put
your
feet
on
oh
but
the
and
the
and
and
all
sorts
of
things
groaned
cynthia
i
afraid
of
them
nonsense
ca
hurt
you
replied
joyce
unsympathetically
if
you
do
come
soon
i
going
on
i
so
impatient
to
see
things
i
ca
wait
you
better
hurry
up
if
you
coming
but
it
is
it
trespassing
cried
cynthia
making
her
last
stand
joyce
scorned
to
argue
further
along
this
line
we
talked
that
all
over
before
i
off
i
got
the
candle
lit
cynthia
suddenly
surrendered
oh
wait
wait
i
coming
she
adopted
joyce
mode
of
ingress
but
found
it
scarcely
as
easy
as
it
looked
and
her
feet
swung
in
space
groping
wildly
for
the
steps
described
i
stuck
i
ca
move
oh
why
am
i
so
fat
and
clumsy
she
moaned
joyce
laughed
placed
her
companion
feet
on
a
ledge
and
hauled
her
down
breathless
cobwebby
and
thoroughly
scared
illustration
a
flight
of
stairs
could
be
dimly
discerned
the
lighted
candle
threw
but
a
feeble
illumination
on
the
big
bare
space
they
stood
in
the
beams
overhead
were
thick
with
cobwebs
hanging
like
gray
portières
from
every
projection
otherwise
the
inclosure
was
clear
except
for
a
few
old
farm
implements
in
a
distant
corner
as
joyce
raised
the
candle
over
her
head
a
flight
of
stairs
could
be
dimly
discerned
this
way
she
ordered
and
they
moved
toward
it
cautiously
at
that
moment
there
came
from
behind
them
a
sudden
scratching
and
scrambling
and
then
a
thud
both
girls
uttered
a
low
frightened
shriek
and
clung
together
but
it
was
only
goliath
disturbed
in
his
they
turned
in
time
to
see
him
clambering
through
the
window
joyce
this
is
horrid
gasped
cynthia
my
heart
is
beating
like
a
let
go
back
it
lovely
chuckled
joyce
it
what
i
always
longed
for
i
feel
like
christopher
columbus
i
would
go
back
now
for
worlds
and
to
think
we
neglected
such
a
mystery
at
our
front
doors
as
you
might
say
all
these
years
and
she
dragged
the
protesting
cynthia
toward
the
cellar
stairs
chapter
ii
in
search
of
adventure
they
stumbled
up
the
cellar
steps
their
eyes
growing
gradually
used
to
the
at
the
top
was
a
shut
door
which
refused
to
be
moved
and
they
feared
for
a
moment
that
failure
awaited
them
in
this
early
period
of
the
voyage
of
discovery
but
after
some
vigorous
pushing
and
rattling
it
gave
with
an
unexpected
jerk
and
they
were
landed
into
a
dark
hallway
now
declared
joyce
this
is
the
beginning
of
something
interesting
i
hope
cynthia
said
nothing
having
indeed
much
ado
to
appear
calm
and
hold
herself
from
making
a
sudden
bolt
back
to
the
cellar
window
with
candle
held
high
joyce
proceeded
to
investigate
their
surroundings
they
seemed
to
be
in
a
wide
central
hall
running
through
the
house
from
front
to
back
a
generous
stairway
of
wood
with
slender
mahogany
railing
ascended
to
an
upper
floor
some
large
paintings
and
portraits
hung
on
the
walls
but
the
candle
did
not
throw
enough
light
to
permit
seeing
them
well
the
furniture
in
the
hall
consisted
of
several
tall
chairs
set
at
intervals
against
the
walls
and
at
one
side
a
massive
table
covered
thick
with
the
dust
of
years
there
was
a
distinctly
different
air
about
the
place
but
nothing
in
any
other
way
remarkable
you
see
remarked
cynthia
there
is
anything
wonderful
here
and
the
air
is
simply
horrid
i
hope
you
satisfied
come
back
but
we
have
seen
a
quarter
of
it
yet
this
is
only
the
hall
now
for
the
room
on
the
right
joyce
hauled
open
a
pair
of
closed
and
held
the
candle
above
her
head
if
they
were
searching
for
things
strange
and
inexplicable
here
at
last
was
their
reward
both
girls
gasped
and
stared
incredulously
first
at
the
scene
before
them
then
at
each
other
the
apartment
was
a
more
portraits
and
paintings
shone
dimly
from
the
walls
a
great
candelabrum
hung
from
the
ceiling
with
sconces
for
nearly
a
hundred
candles
and
ornamented
with
glittering
crystal
pendants
an
enormous
sideboard
occupied
almost
an
entire
end
of
the
room
in
the
middle
a
long
stood
under
the
candelabrum
but
here
was
the
singular
feature
the
table
was
still
set
with
dishes
as
though
for
a
feast
and
the
chairs
about
it
were
all
pushed
awry
and
some
were
overturned
napkins
yellowed
with
age
were
fallen
about
dropped
apparently
in
sudden
forgetfulness
the
china
and
glassware
stood
just
as
they
had
been
left
though
every
ancient
vestige
of
food
had
long
since
been
carried
away
by
the
mice
as
plain
as
print
one
could
read
the
signs
of
some
feasting
party
interrupted
and
guests
hastily
leaving
their
places
to
return
no
more
the
girls
understood
it
in
a
flash
but
why
why
said
joyce
speaking
her
thought
aloud
was
it
all
left
just
like
this
why
were
things
cleared
up
and
put
away
what
could
have
happened
cynthia
this
is
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
cynthia
only
stared
and
offered
no
explanation
plainly
she
was
impressed
at
last
come
on
half
whispered
joyce
let
see
the
room
across
the
hall
i
crazy
to
explore
it
all
together
they
tiptoed
to
the
other
side
of
the
hall
a
kind
of
awe
had
fallen
upon
them
there
was
more
here
than
even
joyce
had
hoped
or
imagined
this
was
a
house
of
mystery
the
apartment
across
the
hall
proved
to
be
the
though
in
evident
disarray
it
however
exhibited
fewer
signs
of
the
strange
agitation
in
dimensions
it
was
similar
to
the
running
from
front
to
back
of
the
house
here
too
was
another
elaborate
candelabrum
somewhat
smaller
than
the
first
queer
chairs
beautiful
cabinets
and
tables
and
an
old
square
piano
still
open
the
chairs
stood
in
irregular
groups
of
twos
and
threes
chumming
cozily
together
as
their
occupants
had
doubtless
done
and
over
the
piano
had
been
carelessly
thrown
a
long
filmy
silk
scarf
one
end
hanging
to
the
floor
upon
everything
the
dust
was
indescribably
thick
and
cobwebs
hung
from
the
ceiling
do
you
know
spoke
joyce
in
a
whisper
after
they
had
looked
a
long
time
i
think
i
can
guess
part
of
an
explanation
for
all
this
there
was
a
party
here
long
long
ago
perhaps
a
folks
had
first
been
sitting
in
the
and
then
went
to
the
for
dinner
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
feast
something
happened
i
ca
imagine
what
but
it
broke
up
the
good
time
right
away
every
one
jumped
up
from
the
table
upsetting
chairs
and
dropping
napkins
perhaps
they
all
rushed
out
of
the
room
anyway
they
never
came
back
to
finish
the
meal
and
after
that
the
owner
shut
the
house
and
boarded
it
up
and
went
away
never
stopping
to
clear
up
or
put
things
to
rights
awfully
sudden
that
and
awfully
queer
goodness
joy
you
as
good
as
a
detective
how
did
you
ever
think
all
that
out
murmured
cynthia
admiringly
why
it
very
simple
said
joyce
the
is
all
right
just
looks
like
any
other
parlor
where
a
lot
of
people
have
been
sitting
before
it
was
put
to
rights
but
the
different
something
happened
there
suddenly
and
people
just
got
their
things
on
and
left
after
that
ca
you
see
it
but
what
it
have
been
oh
i
give
my
to
know
cynthia
see
here
she
added
after
a
moment
thought
i
the
loveliest
idea
you
just
spoke
of
detectives
and
that
put
it
into
my
head
play
we
detectives
like
sherlock
holmes
and
ferret
out
this
mystery
it
will
be
the
greatest
lark
ever
we
will
come
here
often
and
examine
every
bit
of
evidence
we
can
find
and
gather
information
outside
if
we
can
and
put
two
and
two
together
and
see
if
we
make
out
the
whole
story
oh
it
gorgeous
did
two
girls
ever
have
such
an
adventure
before
she
clasped
her
hands
ecstatically
first
having
presented
the
candle
to
cynthia
because
she
was
too
excited
to
hold
it
even
the
placid
and
hitherto
objecting
cynthia
was
fired
by
the
scheme
yes
let
she
assented
i
ask
mother
if
she
knows
anything
about
this
old
place
no
you
wo
cried
joyce
coming
suddenly
to
earth
this
has
got
to
be
kept
a
strict
secret
never
to
breathe
it
never
speak
of
this
house
at
all
never
show
the
slightest
interest
in
it
and
we
must
come
here
often
do
you
want
folks
to
suspect
what
we
are
doing
and
put
a
stop
to
it
all
it
all
right
of
course
we
not
doing
any
actual
wrong
or
harming
anything
but
they
would
understand
very
well
then
agreed
cynthia
meekly
cowed
but
bewildered
i
do
see
though
how
you
going
to
find
out
things
if
you
ask
you
must
get
at
it
in
other
ways
declared
joyce
but
did
not
explain
the
process
just
then
this
candle
will
soon
be
done
for
suddenly
announced
the
practical
cynthia
why
did
you
bring
a
bigger
one
could
find
any
other
said
joyce
let
finish
looking
around
here
and
leave
the
rest
for
another
day
they
began
accordingly
to
walk
slowly
about
the
room
peering
up
at
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
picking
their
way
with
care
around
the
furniture
without
moving
or
touching
anything
presently
they
came
abreast
of
the
great
open
fireplace
a
heavy
chair
was
standing
directly
in
front
of
it
but
curiously
enough
with
its
back
to
what
must
have
been
once
a
cheery
blaze
they
moved
around
it
carefully
and
bent
to
examine
the
pretty
delft
tiles
that
framed
the
yawning
below
the
mantel
then
joyce
stepped
back
to
look
at
the
plates
and
vases
on
the
mantel
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
cry
hello
that
look
cynthia
cynthia
still
studying
the
tiles
straightened
up
to
look
where
her
companion
had
pointed
but
in
that
instant
the
dying
sputtered
flickered
and
leaving
only
a
small
mass
of
warm
tallow
in
cynthia
hand
for
a
moment
there
was
horrified
silence
the
heavy
darkness
seemed
to
cast
a
spell
over
even
the
irrepressible
joyce
but
not
for
long
too
bad
she
began
where
are
the
matches
cynthia
i
handed
them
to
you
we
can
light
our
way
out
by
them
cynthia
produced
the
box
from
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
and
opened
it
mercy
there
are
only
three
left
she
cried
feeling
round
in
it
never
mind
they
will
light
us
out
of
this
room
and
through
the
hall
to
the
cellar
stairs
when
we
get
there
the
window
will
guide
us
cynthia
struck
the
first
match
and
they
hurriedly
picked
their
way
around
the
scattered
furniture
but
the
match
went
out
before
they
reached
the
door
the
second
saw
them
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
long
hall
the
third
alas
broke
short
off
at
its
head
and
proved
useless
then
a
real
terror
of
the
dark
unknown
spaces
filled
them
both
breathless
frantic
they
felt
their
way
along
the
walls
groping
blindly
for
the
elusive
cellar
door
at
length
joyce
hand
struck
a
knob
here
it
is
she
breathed
they
pulled
open
the
door
and
plunged
through
it
only
to
find
themselves
in
some
sort
of
a
closet
groping
among
musty
clothes
that
were
hanging
there
oh
it
is
it
is
wailed
cynthia
oh
i
never
never
come
into
this
dreadful
house
again
but
joyce
had
regained
her
poise
it
all
right
our
door
is
just
across
the
hall
i
remember
where
it
is
now
she
pulled
the
shuddering
cynthia
out
of
the
closet
and
felt
her
way
across
the
wide
hall
space
here
it
is
now
we
are
all
she
cried
triumphantly
opening
a
door
which
they
found
gave
on
a
flight
of
steps
and
as
they
crept
down
a
dim
square
of
good
honest
daylight
sent
their
spirits
up
with
a
bound
it
was
raining
great
pelting
drops
as
they
scrambled
out
and
scampered
for
cynthia
veranda
but
daylight
even
if
dismal
with
rain
had
served
to
restore
them
completely
to
their
usual
gaiety
by
the
way
joyce
she
said
as
they
stood
on
the
porch
shaking
the
rain
from
their
skirts
what
was
it
you
were
pointing
at
just
when
the
candle
went
out
i
did
have
time
to
see
why
the
thing
whispered
joyce
there
was
a
big
picture
hanging
over
the
mantel
but
what
do
you
think
it
hung
there
its
face
turned
to
the
chapter
iii
amateur
detectives
while
cynthia
was
bending
over
her
desk
during
struggling
with
a
hopelessly
entangled
account
in
latin
of
cæsar
and
his
gallic
wars
her
next
neighbor
thrust
a
note
into
her
hand
glad
of
any
diversion
she
opened
it
and
read
this
afternoon
for
the
how
much
have
you
cynthia
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
the
meaning
of
the
initials
but
she
could
not
imagine
what
had
to
do
with
the
matter
so
she
wrote
back
all
right
only
thirty
cents
more
next
week
she
passed
it
along
to
joyce
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
returned
to
cæsar
in
a
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
joyce
she
knew
would
explain
all
mysteries
later
and
she
was
content
to
wait
almost
a
week
had
passed
since
the
first
adventure
of
the
house
and
nothing
further
had
happened
joyce
and
cynthia
were
healthy
normal
girls
full
of
interests
connected
with
their
school
with
outdoor
affairs
and
with
social
life
so
they
had
much
to
occupy
them
beside
this
curious
quest
on
which
they
had
become
engaged
a
fraternity
meeting
had
occupied
one
afternoon
another
a
a
third
and
so
on
through
the
ensuing
week
not
once
however
in
the
midst
of
all
these
outside
interests
had
they
forgotten
their
strange
adventure
when
they
were
alone
together
they
talked
of
it
incessantly
and
laid
elaborate
plans
for
future
amateur
detective
work
it
just
like
a
story
joyce
would
exclaim
and
who
would
ever
have
thought
of
a
in
that
old
house
and
in
the
midst
of
it
cynthia
first
question
that
afternoon
on
the
way
home
from
high
school
was
what
did
you
ask
about
for
i
down
pretty
low
on
my
allowance
but
i
do
see
what
that
got
to
do
with
things
joyce
laughed
well
i
lower
yet
ten
cents
to
last
till
the
month
out
but
it
struck
you
that
we
got
to
have
plenty
of
them
and
matches
and
a
couple
of
candlesticks
at
least
how
else
can
we
ever
get
about
the
place
as
it
all
is
and
if
we
tried
to
get
them
from
home
some
one
would
suspect
right
away
ten
cents
worth
of
candles
ought
to
last
us
quite
a
while
began
the
practical
cynthia
and
ten
cents
more
will
buy
a
whole
package
of
and
for
five
cents
we
can
get
a
candlestick
but
better
stop
at
for
the
present
or
we
wo
have
a
cent
left
between
us
let
get
them
right
now
while
they
were
making
their
purchases
cynthia
had
another
idea
i
tell
you
what
joyce
i
going
to
take
along
a
and
clean
up
around
the
window
where
we
get
in
my
sweater
was
just
black
with
dirt
and
cobwebs
last
time
and
mother
insisted
on
an
explanation
fortunately
she
was
called
away
for
something
just
then
and
afterward
did
think
of
it
i
washed
the
sweater
since
good
idea
assented
joyce
momsie
wanted
to
know
how
i
torn
mine
and
got
it
so
mussy
too
i
told
her
i
been
chasing
up
goliath
which
was
really
quite
true
you
know
i
never
think
of
things
to
say
that
will
be
the
truth
and
yet
not
give
the
whole
thing
away
sighed
the
downright
cynthia
i
wish
i
were
as
quick
as
you
never
mind
you
got
the
cynthia
i
never
would
have
thought
of
the
getting
into
the
house
this
time
was
accompanied
by
less
difficulty
than
the
first
before
entering
cynthia
thoroughly
dusted
the
and
as
far
about
it
as
she
could
reach
with
the
result
that
there
was
less
if
any
damage
to
their
clothes
armed
as
they
were
with
plenty
of
candles
and
matches
there
were
no
shudders
either
or
fears
of
the
unknown
and
the
dark
even
cynthia
was
keen
for
the
quest
and
joyce
was
simply
bursting
with
new
ideas
some
of
which
she
expounded
to
cynthia
as
they
were
lighting
their
candles
in
the
cellar
you
know
cyn
i
been
looking
at
the
place
carefully
from
the
outside
we
have
seen
a
third
of
it
yet
no
not
even
a
there
the
wing
off
the
parlor
toward
your
house
and
the
one
off
the
toward
mine
i
suppose
the
kitchen
must
be
in
that
one
but
i
ca
think
what
in
the
other
unless
it
a
library
we
must
see
these
and
then
there
all
what
i
want
to
see
most
of
all
is
the
picture
you
spoke
of
that
hangs
in
the
parlor
said
cynthia
do
you
suppose
we
could
turn
it
around
oh
i
love
to
only
i
do
know
whether
we
ought
and
it
heavy
too
i
hardly
think
we
could
perhaps
we
might
just
try
to
peep
behind
it
you
know
cynthia
i
realize
we
doing
something
a
little
being
in
this
house
and
prying
about
i
not
sure
our
folks
would
approve
of
it
only
the
old
thing
has
been
left
long
and
such
a
mystery
about
it
and
we
not
harming
or
disturbing
anything
that
perhaps
it
is
so
dreadful
anyhow
we
must
be
careful
not
to
pry
into
anything
we
ought
not
touch
perhaps
then
it
will
be
all
right
cynthia
agreed
to
all
this
without
hesitation
she
indeed
had
even
stronger
feelings
than
joyce
on
the
subject
of
their
trespassing
but
the
joy
of
the
adventure
and
the
mystery
with
which
they
were
surrounding
it
outweighed
her
scruples
when
they
were
up
the
cellar
steps
joyce
who
was
ahead
suddenly
exclaimed
why
the
door
is
open
probably
we
left
it
so
in
our
hurry
the
other
day
we
must
be
more
careful
after
this
and
leave
everything
as
we
find
it
they
tiptoed
along
the
hall
with
considerably
more
confidence
than
on
their
former
visit
pausing
to
hold
their
candles
up
to
the
pictures
and
peeping
for
a
moment
into
the
curiously
disarranged
but
they
entered
the
first
and
stood
a
long
while
before
the
fireplace
gazing
at
the
picture
massive
frame
and
its
challenging
wooden
back
a
heavy
ropelike
cord
with
large
silk
tassels
attached
the
picture
to
its
hook
and
the
cord
was
twisted
as
if
some
one
had
turned
the
picture
about
without
stopping
to
readjust
it
how
strange
murmured
cynthia
but
joyce
had
been
looking
at
something
else
do
you
see
that
big
chair
with
its
back
close
to
the
mantel
she
exclaimed
i
been
wondering
why
it
stands
in
that
position
with
its
back
to
the
fireplace
there
was
a
fire
there
you
can
tell
by
the
ashes
and
that
log
well
do
you
see
some
one
pulled
that
chair
close
to
the
mantel
stepped
on
it
and
turned
the
picture
face
to
the
wall
now
i
wonder
why
but
look
here
cried
cynthia
if
some
one
else
stood
up
there
and
turned
the
picture
around
why
could
we
do
the
same
we
could
turn
it
back
after
we
seen
it
could
we
joyce
thought
it
over
a
moment
i
tell
you
cynthia
and
i
suppose
you
think
me
queer
there
are
two
reasons
why
i
rather
not
do
it
right
now
in
the
first
place
that
silk
cord
it
hanging
by
may
be
awfully
rotten
after
all
these
years
and
if
we
touch
it
the
whole
thing
may
fall
and
then
somehow
i
sort
of
like
to
keep
the
mystery
about
that
picture
till
a
little
later
till
we
seen
the
rest
of
the
house
and
begun
two
and
two
together
would
you
cynthia
agreed
as
she
was
usually
likely
to
do
and
joyce
added
now
let
see
what
in
this
next
room
i
think
it
must
be
a
library
the
door
of
it
opens
right
into
this
bent
on
further
discovery
they
opened
the
closed
door
carefully
it
was
as
joyce
had
guessed
a
library
completely
filled
three
sides
of
the
room
a
long
library
table
with
an
stood
in
the
middle
the
fourth
side
of
the
room
was
practically
devoted
to
another
huge
fireplace
and
over
the
mantel
hung
another
portrait
it
was
of
a
beautiful
young
woman
and
before
it
the
girls
stopped
fascinated
to
gaze
a
long
while
there
was
little
or
nothing
in
this
room
to
indicate
that
any
strange
happening
had
transpired
here
a
few
books
were
strewn
about
as
though
they
had
been
pulled
out
and
thrown
down
hastily
but
that
was
all
the
one
thing
that
attracted
most
strongly
was
the
portrait
of
the
beautiful
woman
she
seemed
scarcely
more
than
a
girl
over
the
fireplace
the
two
explorers
turned
to
gaze
at
it
afresh
there
one
thing
i
noticed
about
it
that
different
from
the
others
said
joyce
thoughtfully
it
fresher
and
more
more
modern
than
the
rest
of
the
portraits
in
the
and
hall
do
you
think
so
cynthia
did
and
look
at
her
dress
those
long
full
sleeves
and
the
big
bulging
skirt
that
different
too
and
then
her
hair
not
high
and
powdered
and
all
fussed
up
but
low
and
parted
smooth
and
drawn
down
over
her
ears
and
that
dear
little
wreath
of
tiny
roses
she
almost
seems
to
be
going
to
speak
and
oh
cynthia
is
she
beautiful
with
those
big
brown
eyes
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
just
loved
her
she
such
a
and
believe
she
had
more
to
do
with
the
queer
things
in
this
house
than
any
of
those
other
tell
you
what
we
go
to
the
public
library
and
get
out
a
big
book
on
costumes
of
the
different
centuries
that
i
saw
there
once
then
by
looking
up
this
one
we
can
tell
just
about
what
time
she
lived
what
do
you
say
as
usual
you
thought
of
just
the
thing
to
do
i
never
would
have
murmured
cynthia
still
gazing
at
the
picture
of
the
lovely
lady
suddenly
joyce
started
nervously
hush
do
you
hear
anything
i
almost
certain
i
heard
a
sound
in
the
other
room
they
both
fell
to
listening
intently
yes
there
a
sound
a
strange
indefinable
one
like
a
soft
tiptoeing
at
long
intervals
and
even
a
curious
hoarse
breathing
something
was
certainly
outside
in
the
what
shall
we
breathed
cynthia
we
ca
get
out
of
here
without
passing
through
that
room
oh
joyce
they
listened
again
the
sound
appeared
to
be
approaching
the
door
it
was
without
doubt
a
soft
tiptoeing
step
suddenly
there
was
the
noise
of
a
chair
scraping
on
the
floor
as
if
it
had
been
accidentally
brushed
against
both
girls
were
now
numb
with
terror
they
were
caught
as
in
a
trap
there
was
no
escape
they
could
only
wait
in
racking
suspense
where
they
were
illustration
they
stared
with
the
fascination
of
horror
as
they
stared
with
the
fascination
of
horror
the
partially
open
door
was
pushed
farther
open
and
a
dim
gray
form
glided
around
its
edge
joyce
clutched
cynthia
gave
one
little
shriek
and
and
gasped
oh
cynthia
goliath
chapter
iv
the
room
of
mystery
it
was
indeed
goliath
he
was
an
enormous
cat
and
his
purr
was
as
oversized
as
his
body
that
was
the
hoarse
sound
that
they
had
thought
was
heavy
breathing
his
footfalls
too
could
be
distinctly
heard
when
all
else
was
quiet
and
he
had
evidently
rubbed
against
some
light
article
of
furniture
in
the
outer
room
and
moved
it
in
the
reaction
of
relief
cynthia
seized
goliath
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
cried
having
first
deposited
her
candlestick
carefully
on
the
table
joyce
did
quite
the
opposite
and
laughed
hysterically
for
several
minutes
the
tension
of
suspense
and
terror
had
been
very
real
how
he
get
in
here
sobbed
cynthia
at
length
why
through
the
window
of
course
and
he
must
have
been
in
before
we
came
do
you
remember
we
found
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
steps
open
i
closed
it
when
we
came
up
so
he
could
have
got
here
afterward
joyce
bent
down
and
scratched
goliath
fat
jowls
at
which
he
purred
the
louder
well
let
let
him
stay
since
he
here
sighed
cynthia
wiping
her
eyes
he
be
sort
of
company
so
goliath
was
allowed
to
remain
and
the
two
girls
escorted
by
him
proceeded
on
their
voyage
of
discovery
back
across
the
and
hall
they
went
and
through
the
there
for
a
moment
they
stood
surveying
anew
the
curious
scene
does
it
strike
you
as
strange
joyce
demanded
suddenly
that
no
silver
here
no
knives
forks
spoons
or
or
anything
of
that
kind
yet
everything
else
in
china
or
glass
is
left
what
do
you
make
of
it
somebody
got
in
and
stole
it
ventured
cynthia
nonsense
nobody
been
here
since
except
ourselves
that
perfectly
plain
no
the
people
must
have
stopped
long
enough
to
collect
it
and
put
it
away
or
take
it
with
them
cynthia
why
you
suppose
they
left
in
such
a
hurry
but
cynthia
the
unimaginative
was
equally
unable
to
answer
this
query
satisfactorily
so
she
only
replied
i
do
know
i
sure
a
room
however
beyond
the
was
awaiting
their
inspection
in
a
corner
of
the
latter
two
funny
little
steps
led
up
to
a
door
and
on
opening
it
they
found
themselves
in
the
kitchen
this
bore
signs
of
as
much
confusion
as
the
neighboring
apartment
unwashed
dishes
and
cooking
utensils
lay
all
about
some
even
broken
in
the
hurry
with
which
they
had
been
handled
but
apart
from
this
further
indication
of
the
haste
with
which
a
meal
had
been
abandoned
unfinished
there
was
little
to
hold
the
interest
and
the
girls
soon
turned
away
now
for
cried
joyce
that
where
i
been
longing
to
get
we
will
find
something
interesting
there
i
warrant
with
goliath
scampering
ahead
they
climbed
the
white
staircase
on
the
upper
floor
they
found
a
wide
hall
corresponding
with
the
one
below
running
from
front
to
back
crossed
by
a
narrower
one
connecting
the
wings
with
the
main
part
of
the
house
turning
to
their
left
they
went
down
the
narrow
one
peering
about
them
eagerly
the
doors
of
several
bedrooms
stood
open
into
the
first
they
entered
the
high
bed
with
its
ruffled
valance
and
tester
was
still
smoothly
made
up
and
undisturbed
the
room
was
in
perfect
order
but
joyce
eye
was
caught
by
two
candlesticks
standing
on
the
mantel
here
a
find
she
announced
we
take
these
to
use
for
our
candles
they
nicer
and
handier
than
our
tin
one
we
will
keep
that
for
an
emergency
but
ought
we
disturb
them
questioned
cynthia
oh
you
are
particular
what
earthly
harm
can
it
do
here
take
this
one
and
i
carry
the
other
this
must
have
been
a
and
no
one
was
occupying
it
when
it
all
happened
let
look
in
the
one
across
the
hall
this
one
also
proved
precisely
similar
bed
untouched
and
furniture
undisturbed
another
close
at
hand
had
the
same
appearance
they
next
ventured
down
a
narrower
hall
over
what
was
evidently
the
kitchen
wing
on
each
side
were
bedrooms
four
in
all
with
sparse
plain
furnishings
and
each
room
presented
a
tumbled
unkempt
appearance
i
guess
these
must
have
been
the
servants
rooms
remarked
cynthia
that
the
first
right
guess
you
made
retorted
joyce
as
she
glanced
about
and
they
all
left
in
a
hurry
too
judging
from
the
way
things
are
strewn
about
i
wonder
what
cried
cynthia
impatient
at
the
long
pause
oh
nothing
much
i
just
wonder
whether
they
went
off
of
their
own
accord
or
were
dismissed
i
ca
tell
but
one
thing
i
can
guess
pretty
plainly
they
went
right
after
the
and
did
stay
over
another
night
why
most
of
their
beds
are
made
and
they
left
everything
in
a
muss
but
come
along
this
particularly
interesting
i
want
to
get
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
something
different
over
there
they
turned
and
retraced
their
steps
emerging
from
the
servants
quarters
and
passing
again
the
rooms
they
had
already
examined
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
hall
they
entered
an
apartment
that
was
not
a
bedroom
but
appeared
to
have
been
used
as
a
and
for
sewing
an
stood
near
one
window
two
chairs
and
another
table
were
heaped
with
material
and
with
garments
in
various
stages
of
completion
an
open
held
spools
but
still
there
was
nothing
special
in
the
room
to
challenge
interest
and
joyce
pulled
her
companion
across
the
hall
toward
another
partially
open
door
they
had
scarcely
been
in
it
long
enough
to
illuminate
it
with
the
pale
flames
of
their
candles
before
they
realized
that
they
were
very
near
the
heart
of
the
mystery
it
was
another
bedroom
the
largest
so
far
and
its
aspect
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
others
the
high
was
tossed
and
tumbled
not
however
as
if
by
a
sleep
but
more
as
if
some
one
had
lain
upon
it
just
as
it
was
twisting
and
turning
restlessly
two
trunks
stood
on
the
floor
open
and
partially
packed
one
seemed
to
contain
household
linen
once
fine
and
dainty
and
white
now
yellowed
and
covered
with
the
dust
of
years
the
other
brimmed
with
clothing
a
woman
all
frills
and
laces
and
silks
and
a
great
collapsed
lay
on
the
floor
alongside
neither
of
the
girls
could
for
the
moment
guess
what
it
was
this
queer
arrangement
of
wires
and
tape
but
joyce
went
over
and
picked
it
up
when
it
fell
into
shape
as
she
held
it
at
then
they
knew
i
have
an
idea
cried
joyce
this
or
crinoline
i
think
they
used
to
call
it
gave
it
to
me
cynthia
we
must
be
in
the
room
belonging
to
the
lovely
lady
whose
picture
hangs
in
the
library
how
do
you
know
queried
cynthia
i
do
i
just
suspect
it
but
perhaps
we
will
find
something
that
proves
it
later
she
held
the
candle
over
one
of
the
trunks
and
peered
in
dresses
hats
waists
she
enumerated
oh
how
queer
and
they
all
seem
suddenly
with
a
little
cry
of
triumph
she
leaned
over
and
partially
pulled
out
an
elaborate
silk
dress
look
look
what
did
i
tell
you
here
is
the
very
dress
of
the
this
queer
changeable
silk
these
big
sleeves
and
the
velvet
sewed
on
in
a
funny
pattern
will
you
believe
me
truly
cynthia
could
no
longer
doubt
it
was
the
identical
dress
beyond
question
the
portrait
must
have
been
painted
when
the
garment
was
new
they
felt
that
at
last
they
had
taken
a
long
step
in
the
right
direction
by
thus
identifying
this
room
as
belonging
to
the
lovely
lady
of
the
portrait
joy
grew
so
excited
that
she
could
hardly
contain
a
hurrah
and
cynthia
was
not
far
behind
her
in
enthusiasm
but
the
room
had
further
details
to
be
examined
an
open
fireplace
showed
traces
of
letters
having
been
torn
up
and
burned
little
scraps
with
faint
writing
still
lay
scattered
on
the
hearth
on
the
articles
of
the
toilet
were
littered
about
and
a
pair
of
candlesticks
were
set
close
to
the
mirror
there
were
by
the
way
no
traces
of
about
the
house
mice
had
doubtless
carried
off
every
vestige
of
such
long
since
a
great
wardrobe
stood
in
one
corner
the
open
doors
of
which
revealed
some
garments
still
hanging
on
the
pegs
woolen
dresses
mostly
reduced
now
to
little
more
than
rags
through
the
ravages
of
moths
and
mice
and
time
near
the
bed
stood
a
pair
of
dainty
satin
slippers
forgotten
through
the
years
everywhere
a
hasty
departure
was
indicated
so
hasty
as
joyce
remarked
that
the
lady
decided
probably
not
to
take
her
trunks
after
all
but
left
very
likely
with
only
a
and
now
cried
joyce
the
irrepressible
we
seen
everything
in
this
room
let
hurry
to
look
at
the
last
one
on
this
floor
right
over
the
library
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
hall
discovered
a
lot
here
but
i
a
notion
that
we
find
the
best
of
all
in
there
as
they
were
leaving
the
room
goliath
who
had
curled
himself
up
on
a
soft
rug
before
the
fireplace
rose
stretched
himself
yawned
widely
and
prepared
to
follow
wherever
they
led
does
he
seem
at
home
here
laughed
cynthia
i
hope
he
will
come
every
time
we
do
he
makes
things
seem
more
natural
somehow
they
reached
the
end
of
the
hall
and
joyce
fumbled
for
the
handle
this
door
contrary
to
the
usual
rule
being
shut
then
for
the
first
time
in
the
course
of
their
adventures
in
the
house
they
found
themselves
before
an
insurmountable
barrier
the
door
was
locked
chapter
v
joyce
makes
a
new
discovery
so
does
goliath
yes
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
no
vestige
of
a
key
joyce
was
suddenly
inspired
with
an
idea
let
try
the
keys
of
the
other
doors
i
noticed
that
they
most
all
had
keys
in
the
locks
perhaps
one
will
fit
this
they
hunted
up
several
and
worked
with
them
all
but
not
one
made
the
slightest
impression
on
this
obstinate
lock
now
is
this
provoking
exclaimed
joyce
the
only
room
in
the
house
that
we
ca
get
in
and
the
most
interesting
of
all
i
certain
what
we
do
cynthia
made
no
reply
but
looked
at
her
little
silver
watch
do
you
know
that
it
six
she
asked
quietly
mercy
no
we
got
to
go
at
once
then
how
the
time
has
gone
reluctantly
enough
they
hunted
up
goliath
who
in
thorough
boredom
had
returned
to
his
place
on
the
in
the
big
bedroom
gathered
together
their
candles
and
found
their
way
to
the
cellar
cynthia
had
thoughtfully
requested
a
tin
from
the
grocer
and
in
this
they
packed
their
candles
thus
protecting
them
against
the
ravages
of
mice
and
left
them
in
the
cellar
near
the
window
then
they
clambered
out
saturday
said
joyce
in
the
morning
we
go
to
the
library
and
look
up
that
book
of
costumes
after
lunch
we
go
back
to
the
and
finish
exploring
there
the
attic
yet
and
maybe
we
can
find
that
key
too
with
a
gay
they
separated
each
to
her
home
on
opposite
sides
of
the
house
the
result
of
their
researches
in
the
library
next
morning
was
not
wholly
satisfactory
they
found
that
the
most
recent
fashion
of
or
crinolines
had
prevailed
all
the
way
from
to
or
thereabouts
and
while
these
dates
limited
to
a
certain
extent
the
time
of
the
mysterious
happening
it
did
not
help
them
very
much
they
felt
that
they
must
look
for
some
more
definite
clue
that
afternoon
they
entered
the
house
for
the
third
time
they
found
goliath
already
in
the
cellar
owing
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
bates
pup
was
patrolling
the
front
yard
so
they
invited
him
to
accompany
them
an
invitation
which
he
accepted
with
arched
back
and
resounding
purr
deciding
to
explore
the
attic
first
they
found
that
a
door
from
the
upper
hall
opened
on
a
stairway
leading
to
it
at
any
other
time
or
in
any
other
house
they
would
have
found
this
attic
of
absorbing
interest
in
its
dusky
corners
stood
spinning
wheels
and
decrepit
furniture
of
an
ancient
date
had
found
a
refuge
there
antique
hair
trunks
lined
the
sides
under
the
eaves
and
quaint
garments
hung
about
on
pegs
the
attic
was
the
only
apartment
in
this
strange
house
that
received
the
light
of
day
for
the
two
little
windows
like
staring
eyes
were
not
boarded
up
so
dim
were
they
however
with
dirt
and
cobwebs
that
very
little
daylight
filtered
through
but
the
attic
had
no
great
holding
interest
at
present
since
it
was
evident
that
it
contained
no
clue
to
help
them
in
the
solution
of
the
mystery
and
they
soon
left
it
to
search
anew
every
room
below
in
the
hope
of
coming
upon
the
missing
key
these
keys
are
so
immense
that
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
any
one
would
carry
one
off
far
conjectured
joyce
but
why
in
the
world
should
just
that
room
be
locked
anyway
what
can
be
hidden
there
i
wild
simply
wild
with
impatience
to
see
it
all
the
search
for
the
key
was
not
exactly
systematic
neither
of
the
girls
felt
at
liberty
to
open
or
pry
into
closets
and
trunks
besides
as
cynthia
wisely
suggested
it
was
not
likely
that
any
one
would
lock
a
door
so
carefully
and
then
put
the
key
in
a
drawer
or
trunk
or
on
a
shelf
they
would
either
carry
it
away
with
them
or
lay
it
down
forgotten
or
hide
it
in
some
unusual
place
if
it
had
been
carried
away
of
course
their
search
was
useless
but
if
it
had
been
thoughtlessly
laid
aside
somewhere
or
even
hidden
away
in
some
obscure
corner
there
a
possibility
that
they
might
come
upon
it
with
this
hope
in
mind
they
went
from
room
to
room
searching
on
desks
chairs
and
tables
poking
into
dark
corners
peeping
into
vases
and
other
such
receptacles
and
feeling
about
under
the
furniture
but
all
to
no
purpose
they
came
at
last
to
the
great
bedroom
where
were
so
many
signs
of
agitation
and
hurried
departure
deciding
that
here
would
be
the
most
likely
field
for
discovery
goliath
had
evidently
preceded
them
for
they
found
him
once
more
curled
up
on
the
soft
rug
before
the
fireplace
he
seemed
to
prefer
this
comfortable
spot
to
all
others
but
he
rose
and
stretched
when
the
girls
came
in
joyce
went
straight
for
the
i
going
to
poke
among
these
ashes
she
announced
a
lot
of
things
seem
to
have
been
burned
here
mostly
old
letters
who
knows
but
what
the
key
may
have
been
thrown
in
too
she
began
to
rake
the
dead
ashes
and
suddenly
a
log
fell
apart
dropping
something
through
to
the
bottom
with
a
chinking
sound
did
you
hear
that
she
whispered
something
clinked
ashes
or
wood
wo
make
that
sound
oh
suppose
it
is
the
key
she
raked
away
again
frantically
and
hauled
out
a
quantity
of
charred
debris
but
nothing
even
faintly
resembling
a
key
when
nothing
more
remained
she
poked
the
fragments
disgustedly
while
cynthia
looked
on
see
there
cynthia
suddenly
exclaimed
it
is
a
key
but
that
round
thing
joyce
had
seen
it
at
the
same
moment
and
picked
it
up
a
small
elliptical
disk
so
blackened
with
soot
that
nothing
could
be
made
of
it
till
it
was
wiped
off
when
freed
from
its
coating
of
black
one
side
proved
to
be
of
shining
metal
probably
gold
and
the
other
of
some
white
or
yellowish
substance
the
girls
could
not
tell
just
what
in
the
center
of
this
was
a
curious
smear
of
various
dim
colors
illustration
well
what
do
you
suppose
that
can
be
queried
cynthia
well
what
do
you
suppose
that
can
be
queried
cynthia
i
ca
imagine
whatever
it
was
the
fire
has
pretty
well
finished
it
you
can
see
that
it
must
have
been
rather
valuable
once
there
gold
on
it
here
another
question
to
add
to
our
catechism
what
is
it
and
why
was
it
thrown
in
the
fire
whatever
it
was
it
does
help
much
now
if
it
had
only
been
the
key
good
gracious
is
that
a
rat
both
girls
jumped
to
their
feet
and
stood
listening
to
the
strange
sounds
that
came
from
under
the
valance
hanging
about
the
bottom
of
the
great
bed
it
was
a
curious
intermittent
irregular
sound
as
of
something
being
pushed
about
the
floor
after
they
had
listened
a
moment
it
suddenly
struck
them
both
that
the
noise
was
somehow
very
familiar
why
it
goliath
of
course
laughed
cynthia
this
is
the
second
time
he
has
scared
us
he
has
something
under
there
that
he
playing
with
knocking
it
about
you
know
let
see
what
it
is
they
tiptoed
over
and
raised
the
valance
cynthia
was
right
goliath
was
under
the
bed
dabbing
gracefully
with
one
paw
at
something
attached
to
a
string
or
narrow
ribbon
despite
the
rolls
of
dust
that
lay
about
joyce
crawled
under
and
rescued
it
she
emerged
with
a
flushed
face
and
a
triumphant
chuckle
goliath
beats
us
all
he
made
the
best
find
yet
is
it
the
key
cried
cynthia
no
it
this
and
before
cynthia
astonished
eyes
joyce
dangled
a
large
gold
locket
suspended
on
a
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
in
the
the
locket
glistened
with
tiny
jewels
do
you
recognize
it
demanded
joyce
it
how
should
i
why
cynthia
it
the
very
one
that
hangs
about
the
neck
of
our
lovely
lady
in
the
picture
it
was
indeed
no
other
even
the
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
was
identical
she
must
have
dropped
it
accidentally
perhaps
when
she
took
it
off
and
it
rolled
under
the
bed
in
her
hurry
she
probably
forgot
it
said
joyce
laying
it
beside
the
curious
disk
they
had
raked
from
the
fireplace
is
it
a
beauty
it
must
be
very
valuable
cynthia
bent
down
and
examined
both
articles
closely
did
you
notice
joyce
she
presently
remarked
that
those
two
things
are
exactly
the
same
shape
and
almost
the
same
size
why
so
they
are
exclaimed
joyce
oh
i
have
an
idea
cynthia
can
we
open
the
locket
let
try
she
picked
it
up
and
pried
at
the
catch
with
her
after
a
trifling
resistance
it
yielded
the
locket
fell
open
and
revealed
itself
empty
joyce
took
up
the
disk
and
fitted
it
into
one
side
with
the
gold
back
pressed
inward
it
slid
into
place
leaving
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
it
had
originally
formed
part
of
this
trinket
now
announced
joyce
i
know
it
was
a
miniature
an
ivory
one
but
the
fire
has
entirely
destroyed
the
likeness
question
how
came
it
in
the
fire
the
two
girls
stood
looking
at
each
other
and
at
the
locket
more
bewildered
than
ever
by
this
curious
discovery
goliath
cheated
of
his
plaything
was
making
futile
dabs
at
the
dangling
velvet
ribbon
suddenly
joyce
straightened
up
and
looked
cynthia
squarely
in
the
eyes
i
thought
it
out
she
said
quietly
it
just
came
to
me
the
miniature
was
taken
out
of
the
locket
on
purpose
it
the
miniature
was
of
the
same
person
whose
picture
is
turned
to
the
wall
chapter
vi
joyce
theory
cynthia
what
your
theory
about
the
mystery
of
the
house
the
two
girls
were
sitting
in
a
favorite
nook
of
theirs
under
an
old
bent
in
the
yard
back
of
the
house
on
a
sunny
morning
a
week
later
they
were
supposed
to
be
cramming
for
the
monthly
exams
and
had
their
books
spread
out
all
around
them
cynthia
looked
up
with
a
frown
from
an
irregular
latin
conjugation
what
a
why
you
know
in
conan
doyle
mystery
stories
always
has
a
about
what
has
happened
before
he
really
knows
that
is
he
makes
up
a
story
of
his
own
from
the
few
things
he
has
found
out
before
he
gets
at
the
whole
truth
well
replied
cynthia
laying
aside
her
latin
grammar
since
you
ask
me
my
theory
is
that
some
one
committed
a
murder
in
that
room
we
get
in
then
locked
it
up
and
went
away
and
had
the
house
all
boarded
up
so
it
would
be
discovered
i
lain
awake
nights
thinking
of
it
and
i
just
as
lief
get
into
that
room
if
it
so
joyce
broke
into
a
peal
of
laughter
oh
cynthia
if
that
is
exactly
like
you
who
but
you
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
do
see
anything
queer
about
it
retorted
cynthia
everything
point
that
way
certainly
not
cynthia
sprague
do
you
suppose
that
even
years
and
years
ago
any
one
in
a
big
house
like
this
could
commit
a
murder
and
then
calmly
lock
up
and
walk
away
and
the
matter
never
be
investigated
that
absurd
the
murdered
person
would
be
missed
and
people
would
wonder
why
the
place
was
left
like
this
and
the
the
authorities
would
get
in
here
in
a
hurry
no
there
was
any
murder
or
anything
bloodthirsty
at
all
something
very
different
well
since
you
do
like
theory
replied
cynthia
still
nettled
what
yours
of
course
you
one
yes
i
have
one
and
i
have
lain
awake
nights
too
thinking
it
out
i
tell
you
what
it
is
and
if
you
do
agree
with
me
you
free
to
say
so
here
the
way
it
all
seems
to
me
whatever
happened
in
that
house
must
have
concerned
two
persons
at
least
and
one
of
them
you
must
admit
was
our
lovely
lady
whose
portrait
hangs
in
the
library
her
room
and
clothes
and
locket
show
that
she
looks
very
young
but
she
must
have
been
some
one
of
importance
in
the
house
probably
the
mistress
or
she
would
have
occupied
the
biggest
bedroom
and
had
her
picture
on
the
wall
you
think
that
much
is
all
right
do
you
cynthia
nodded
then
there
some
one
else
that
one
we
do
know
anything
at
all
about
but
it
is
hard
to
guess
that
it
was
the
person
whose
picture
is
turned
to
the
wall
and
whose
miniature
was
in
the
locket
and
who
probably
occupied
the
room
that
person
must
have
been
some
near
and
dear
relation
of
the
lovely
lady
surely
but
what
we
tell
yet
it
might
be
mother
father
sister
brother
husband
son
or
daughter
any
of
these
the
lovely
lady
i
have
to
call
her
that
because
we
do
know
her
name
was
giving
a
party
and
every
one
was
at
dinner
when
word
was
suddenly
brought
to
her
about
this
relative
or
perhaps
the
person
was
right
there
and
did
something
that
displeased
her
i
ca
tell
which
whatever
it
was
bad
news
either
way
it
could
only
have
been
one
of
two
things
either
the
relative
was
dead
or
had
done
something
awful
and
disgraceful
anyhow
the
lovely
lady
was
so
terribly
shocked
by
it
that
she
dismissed
her
dinner
party
right
away
i
do
suppose
she
felt
it
right
to
do
it
it
was
not
very
polite
but
probably
excusable
under
the
circumstances
maybe
she
fainted
away
suggested
cynthia
practically
ladies
were
always
doing
that
years
ago
especially
when
they
heard
bad
news
good
enough
agreed
joyce
i
never
thought
of
it
she
probably
did
of
course
that
would
break
up
the
party
at
once
well
when
she
came
to
and
every
one
had
gone
she
was
wild
frantic
with
grief
or
disappointment
or
disgust
and
decided
she
just
stay
in
that
house
any
longer
she
must
have
dismissed
her
servants
right
away
though
why
she
did
make
them
clear
up
first
i
ca
think
then
she
began
to
pack
up
to
go
away
and
decided
she
would
bother
taking
most
of
her
things
and
sometime
just
about
then
she
probably
turned
the
picture
to
the
wall
and
took
the
other
one
out
of
her
locket
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
then
she
went
away
and
never
never
came
back
any
more
yes
but
how
about
the
house
objected
cynthia
how
did
that
get
boarded
up
i
have
thought
that
out
said
joyce
she
may
have
stayed
long
enough
to
see
the
boarding
up
done
or
she
may
have
ordered
some
one
to
do
it
later
it
can
be
done
from
the
outside
i
think
she
was
foolish
to
leave
all
her
good
clothes
commented
cynthia
and
the
locket
under
the
bed
too
i
do
believe
she
remembered
the
locket
or
cared
about
it
mused
joyce
she
was
probably
too
upset
and
hurried
to
think
of
it
again
and
i
sure
she
lay
on
the
bed
and
cried
a
good
deal
it
looks
like
that
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
theory
cynthia
why
i
think
it
is
all
right
fine
as
far
as
it
goes
i
never
could
have
pieced
things
together
in
that
way
but
you
have
thought
about
who
this
mysterious
relative
was
have
you
yes
i
have
but
of
course
that
much
harder
to
decide
because
we
have
so
little
to
go
on
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
pretty
nearly
settled
though
whatever
happened
it
was
that
anybody
when
people
die
you
terribly
grieved
and
upset
of
course
and
you
shut
up
your
house
and
never
come
near
it
again
i
heard
of
such
things
happening
but
you
generally
put
things
nicely
to
rights
first
and
you
do
go
away
and
forget
more
than
half
your
belongings
if
you
do
tend
to
these
things
yourself
you
get
some
one
else
to
do
it
for
you
and
one
other
thing
is
certain
too
you
do
turn
the
dead
relative
picture
to
the
wall
or
tear
it
out
of
your
locket
and
throw
it
into
the
fire
you
be
far
more
likely
to
keep
the
picture
always
near
so
that
you
could
look
at
it
often
is
that
so
of
course
assented
cynthia
then
it
have
been
the
other
thing
that
happened
somebody
did
something
wrong
or
disappointing
or
disgraceful
it
must
have
been
a
dreadful
thing
to
make
the
lovely
lady
desert
that
house
forever
i
ca
imagine
what
but
what
about
the
room
interrupted
cynthia
have
you
any
theory
about
that
you
have
mentioned
it
that
something
i
simply
ca
puzzle
out
confessed
joyce
the
lovely
lady
must
have
locked
it
or
the
disgraceful
relative
may
have
done
it
or
some
one
entirely
different
i
ca
make
any
sense
out
of
it
well
joy
answered
cynthia
you
a
theory
about
what
happened
and
it
certainly
sounds
sensible
now
have
you
any
about
what
relative
it
was
that
the
next
most
interesting
thing
i
do
think
it
could
have
been
her
father
or
mother
replied
joyce
thoughtfully
parents
are
liable
to
cause
that
kind
of
trouble
so
we
count
them
out
she
looks
very
young
not
nearly
old
enough
to
have
a
son
or
daughter
who
would
do
anything
very
dreadful
so
count
out
is
this
just
like
the
in
algebra
that
leaves
only
brother
sister
or
husband
to
be
thought
about
you
forget
aunts
uncles
and
cousins
interposed
cynthia
oh
cyn
how
absurd
they
are
much
too
distant
it
have
been
some
one
nearer
than
that
to
matter
so
much
i
think
it
most
likely
her
husband
then
decided
cynthia
matter
most
of
all
yes
i
thought
of
that
but
here
the
objection
her
husband
supposing
she
had
one
would
probably
have
owned
this
house
consequently
he
would
be
likely
to
allow
it
to
be
shut
up
forever
in
this
queer
way
he
come
back
after
a
while
and
do
what
he
pleased
with
it
no
i
do
think
it
was
her
husband
or
that
she
was
married
at
all
it
must
have
been
either
a
sister
or
brother
a
younger
one
probably
and
the
lovely
lady
loved
her
or
him
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
look
here
interrupted
cynthia
suddenly
there
the
easiest
way
to
decide
all
this
what
is
it
cried
joyce
opening
her
eyes
wide
why
just
go
in
there
and
turn
that
picture
in
the
around
oh
cynthia
you
jewel
of
it
will
be
the
easiest
way
what
geese
we
are
to
have
waited
so
long
only
it
will
be
a
heavy
thing
to
lift
but
the
time
has
come
when
it
must
be
done
let
go
right
away
full
of
new
enthusiasm
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
approached
the
cellar
window
by
a
circuitous
route
they
were
always
very
careful
that
they
should
not
be
observed
in
this
and
were
soon
in
the
dim
cellar
lighting
their
candles
then
they
scurried
entered
the
and
set
their
candlesticks
on
the
table
after
that
they
removed
all
the
breakable
ornaments
from
the
mantel
and
drew
another
chair
close
to
the
fireplace
now
commanded
joyce
stepping
on
the
seat
of
one
while
cynthia
mounted
the
other
be
awfully
careful
that
red
silk
cord
it
hangs
by
is
perfectly
rotten
i
surprised
it
has
given
way
before
this
probably
as
soon
as
we
touch
the
picture
the
cord
will
break
if
so
let
the
picture
down
gently
to
rest
on
the
mantel
ready
they
reached
out
and
grasped
the
heavy
frame
true
to
joy
prediction
the
silk
cord
snapped
at
once
and
the
picture
whole
weight
rested
in
their
hands
quick
cried
cynthia
i
ca
hold
it
any
longer
and
with
a
thud
the
heavy
burden
slipped
to
the
mantel
but
there
was
no
damage
done
and
feeling
on
the
other
side
joyce
discovered
that
it
had
no
glass
now
what
asked
cynthia
we
must
turn
it
around
as
it
rests
here
we
can
easily
balance
it
on
the
mantel
with
infinite
caution
and
some
threatened
mishaps
they
finally
got
it
into
position
right
side
to
the
front
and
sprang
down
to
get
their
candles
on
holding
them
close
however
the
picture
was
found
to
be
so
coated
with
gray
dust
that
absolutely
nothing
was
distinguishable
get
the
ordered
joyce
and
cynthia
all
excitement
rushed
down
cellar
to
find
it
when
she
returned
they
carefully
wiped
from
the
painting
its
coating
of
the
dust
of
years
and
again
held
their
candles
to
illumine
the
result
for
one
long
intense
moment
they
stared
at
it
and
then
simultaneously
they
broke
into
a
peal
of
hysterical
giggles
chapter
vii
goliath
makes
another
discovery
oh
cynthia
gasped
joy
at
length
is
it
too
comical
we
just
as
far
from
it
all
as
ever
and
they
both
fell
to
chuckling
again
they
were
certainly
no
nearer
the
solution
of
their
problem
for
facing
the
room
once
more
the
mysterious
picture
looked
forth
the
portrait
of
they
were
plump
placid
babies
aged
probably
about
two
or
three
years
and
they
appeared
precisely
alike
it
took
no
great
stretch
of
imagination
to
conjecture
what
they
were
twins
and
evidently
brother
and
sister
for
one
youngster
dress
being
a
trifle
severe
in
style
indicated
that
it
was
doubtless
a
boy
these
two
cherubic
infants
had
both
big
brown
eyes
fat
red
cheeks
and
adorable
fluffy
golden
curls
they
were
pictured
as
sitting
hand
in
hand
on
a
green
bank
under
a
huge
spreading
tree
and
gazing
solemnly
toward
a
distant
church
steeple
the
poor
little
things
cried
cynthia
think
of
them
having
been
turned
to
the
wall
all
these
years
now
what
was
the
sense
of
it
two
innocent
babies
like
that
but
joyce
had
not
been
listening
all
at
once
she
put
down
her
candle
on
the
table
and
faced
her
companion
i
got
it
she
announced
it
came
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
of
course
those
babies
are
twins
brother
and
sister
any
one
can
tell
that
well
do
you
see
one
of
them
the
girl
was
our
lovely
lady
the
other
was
her
twin
brother
it
all
as
clear
as
day
the
twin
brother
did
something
she
did
like
and
she
turned
his
picture
to
the
wall
hers
happened
to
be
in
the
same
frame
too
but
she
evidently
did
care
about
that
now
what
have
you
to
say
cynthia
sprague
you
must
be
right
admitted
cynthia
i
thought
we
were
again
when
i
first
saw
that
picture
but
it
been
of
some
use
after
all
do
you
suppose
the
miniature
was
a
copy
of
the
same
thing
it
may
have
been
or
perhaps
it
was
just
the
brother
alone
when
he
was
older
we
ca
tell
about
that
all
this
while
cynthia
had
been
standing
candle
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
at
that
point
she
put
the
candlestick
on
the
table
and
stood
gazing
intently
at
the
presently
she
spoke
joyce
you
think
there
would
be
any
harm
in
my
doing
something
i
longed
to
do
ever
since
we
first
entered
this
house
what
in
the
world
is
that
queried
joyce
why
i
want
to
this
place
and
clear
out
of
the
way
some
of
the
dirt
and
cobwebs
they
worry
me
terribly
and
besides
i
like
to
see
what
this
lovely
furniture
looks
like
without
such
quantities
of
dust
all
over
it
good
scheme
cyn
cried
joyce
instantly
delighted
with
the
new
idea
i
tell
you
what
we
come
in
here
this
afternoon
with
old
clothes
on
and
have
a
regular
it
ca
hurt
anything
sure
for
we
wo
disturb
things
at
all
i
bring
a
too
and
an
old
broom
but
let
go
and
finish
our
studying
now
and
get
that
out
of
the
way
hurrah
for
this
afternoon
filled
with
fresh
enthusiasm
the
two
girls
rushed
out
to
hurry
through
the
necessary
studies
before
the
anticipated
picnic
of
the
afternoon
if
their
respective
mothers
had
requested
them
to
perform
so
arduous
a
task
as
this
at
home
they
would
without
doubt
have
been
instantly
plunged
into
deep
despair
but
because
they
were
to
execute
the
work
in
an
old
deserted
mansion
saturated
with
mystery
no
pleasure
they
could
think
of
was
to
be
compared
with
it
this
thought
however
did
not
enter
the
heads
of
the
enthusiastic
pair
smuggling
the
paraphernalia
into
the
cellar
window
unobserved
that
afternoon
proved
no
easy
task
for
cynthia
had
added
a
and
to
the
outfit
joyce
came
to
the
fray
with
an
old
broom
and
a
which
latter
she
thought
she
had
carefully
concealed
under
her
sweater
but
a
long
end
soon
worked
out
and
trailed
behind
her
unnoticed
till
goliath
basking
on
the
veranda
steps
spied
it
the
lure
proved
too
much
for
him
and
he
came
sporting
after
it
as
friskily
as
a
young
kitten
much
to
cynthia
delight
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
oh
let
him
come
along
she
urged
i
do
love
to
see
him
about
that
old
house
he
makes
it
sort
of
cozier
and
besides
he
seems
to
belong
to
it
anyway
you
know
he
discovered
it
first
and
so
goliath
followed
into
the
house
they
began
on
the
before
they
had
been
at
work
very
long
they
found
that
they
had
let
themselves
in
for
a
bigger
task
than
they
had
dreamed
added
to
that
performing
it
by
dim
did
not
lessen
its
difficulties
but
rather
increased
them
tenfold
first
they
took
turns
sweeping
as
best
they
could
with
a
very
ancient
and
frowsy
broom
the
thick
carpet
when
they
had
gone
over
it
once
and
taken
up
what
seemed
like
a
small
of
dust
they
found
that
after
all
there
remained
almost
as
much
as
ever
on
the
floor
cynthia
was
for
going
over
it
again
oh
never
mind
it
sighed
joyce
my
arms
ache
and
so
do
yours
do
it
again
another
time
now
let
dust
the
furniture
and
pictures
and
they
fell
to
work
with
and
half
an
hour
later
exhausted
and
grimy
they
dropped
into
chairs
and
surveyed
the
results
it
was
of
course
as
but
a
drop
in
the
bucket
in
comparison
with
all
the
scrubbing
and
cleaning
that
was
needed
yet
little
as
it
was
it
had
already
made
a
vast
difference
in
the
aspect
of
the
room
surface
dust
at
least
had
been
removed
and
the
fine
old
furniture
gave
a
hint
of
its
real
elegance
and
polish
joyce
glanced
at
the
big
hanging
candelabrum
and
sighed
with
weariness
then
she
suddenly
remarked
cynthia
we
have
the
light
here
with
only
those
two
candles
why
not
have
some
more
burning
we
only
three
left
commented
cynthia
practical
as
ever
and
my
is
getting
low
again
and
you
have
any
left
as
usual
so
we
better
economize
till
allowance
day
tell
you
what
cried
joyce
freshly
inspired
i
the
loveliest
idea
do
you
just
long
to
know
what
this
room
would
look
like
with
that
big
candelabrum
going
i
do
they
say
illumination
by
is
the
prettiest
in
the
world
sometime
i
going
to
buy
enough
wax
candles
to
fill
that
whole
chandelier
or
candelabrum
rather
and
light
it
just
once
and
see
how
it
makes
things
look
what
do
you
say
it
cost
you
a
good
deal
more
than
a
dollar
remarked
cynthia
after
an
interval
spent
in
calculation
of
course
i
like
to
see
it
too
so
i
go
halves
with
you
on
the
expense
and
i
do
believe
we
can
get
nice
candles
only
penny
tallow
ones
but
they
have
to
do
i
wonder
though
if
people
could
see
the
light
from
the
street
through
any
chinks
in
the
boarding
of
course
not
said
joyce
do
you
see
how
all
the
inside
shutters
are
closed
and
the
velvet
curtains
drawn
it
is
possible
then
have
the
illumination
for
a
treat
sometime
and
i
begin
to
save
up
for
it
and
i
hope
before
that
time
we
have
puzzled
out
this
mystery
i
afraid
we
are
very
good
detectives
or
we
have
done
it
long
before
this
sherlock
holmes
would
have
but
remember
suggested
cynthia
that
those
sherlock
holmes
mysteries
were
usually
solved
very
soon
after
the
thing
happened
this
took
place
years
and
years
ago
i
reckon
we
doing
pretty
nearly
as
well
as
sherlock
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
perhaps
that
so
admitted
joyce
thoughtfully
it
not
so
easy
after
goodness
knows
how
many
years
but
i
rested
now
come
and
see
what
we
can
do
with
the
library
i
wild
to
look
at
the
lovely
lady
again
i
really
think
i
that
picture
and
so
in
the
adjoining
room
they
stood
a
while
with
elevated
candles
gazing
fascinated
at
the
portrait
of
the
beautiful
woman
she
lovely
lovely
lovely
sighed
joyce
oh
would
i
like
to
have
known
her
and
do
you
notice
cynthia
she
has
the
same
big
brown
eyes
of
the
in
the
parlor
there
is
a
doubt
but
what
that
baby
was
she
they
tore
themselves
away
from
the
portrait
after
a
time
and
commenced
digging
at
the
dust
and
cobwebs
of
the
library
but
they
were
thoroughly
tired
after
their
heroic
struggles
with
the
and
made
on
the
whole
but
little
progress
added
to
this
their
enthusiasm
for
had
waned
considerably
i
guess
we
have
to
leave
this
for
another
day
groaned
joyce
at
last
i
just
all
right
assented
cynthia
in
muffled
tones
her
head
being
under
a
great
desk
in
the
corner
but
wait
till
i
finish
sweeping
out
under
here
what
that
i
just
touched
something
soft
on
the
instant
joyce
was
at
her
side
with
the
candle
why
it
goliath
as
usual
they
both
cried
peering
in
is
he
the
greatest
for
getting
into
odd
corners
far
at
the
back
sat
goliath
curled
into
a
comfortable
ball
his
front
paws
tucked
under
and
purring
loudly
he
sitting
on
an
old
newspaper
i
think
said
joyce
he
always
does
that
if
he
can
find
one
because
they
warm
suddenly
she
snatched
at
the
paper
so
violently
that
goliath
went
tobogganing
off
with
a
protesting
meouw
look
look
cynthia
she
exclaimed
brushing
off
a
cloud
of
dust
with
the
and
pointing
to
the
top
of
the
sheet
here
one
of
the
biggest
discoveries
yet
and
cynthia
following
her
read
aloud
april
which
proves
added
joyce
that
whatever
happened
here
did
take
place
much
than
this
date
or
the
paper
would
be
here
what
we
want
to
do
now
is
hunt
around
and
see
if
there
are
any
newspapers
of
a
date
let
do
it
this
minute
forgetting
all
their
weariness
they
seized
their
candles
and
scurried
through
the
house
finding
an
occasional
paper
tucked
away
in
some
odd
corner
but
upon
examination
these
all
proved
to
be
of
earlier
date
than
that
of
their
first
discovery
and
when
it
was
clear
that
there
were
no
more
to
be
found
joyce
announced
well
i
convinced
that
the
house
mystery
happened
not
earlier
than
april
and
probably
not
much
later
that
over
forty
years
ago
for
this
is
just
think
cynthia
of
this
place
standing
shut
up
and
untouched
and
lonely
all
that
time
wonderful
but
cynthia
had
turned
and
snatched
up
goliath
you
precious
cat
she
crooned
to
him
as
he
struggled
unappreciatively
in
her
embrace
you
the
best
detective
of
us
all
we
ought
to
change
your
name
to
holmes
chapter
viii
cynthia
has
an
idea
it
no
use
cynthia
we
come
to
the
end
of
our
rope
joyce
sat
back
on
her
heels
she
had
been
rummaging
through
a
box
of
old
trash
in
the
kitchen
of
the
house
and
wiped
her
grimy
hands
on
the
cynthia
perched
gingerly
on
the
edge
of
a
rickety
chair
nodded
a
vigorous
assent
gave
it
up
long
ago
it
seemed
so
hopeless
but
you
continue
to
hunt
so
i
trotted
around
after
you
and
said
nothing
more
than
three
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
finding
of
the
old
newspaper
and
the
definite
settling
of
the
date
filled
with
new
hope
over
this
find
the
girls
had
continued
to
search
diligently
through
the
neglected
old
mansion
strong
in
the
belief
that
they
would
eventually
discover
if
not
the
missing
key
at
least
a
trail
of
clues
that
would
lead
to
the
unraveling
of
the
mystery
the
mystery
however
refused
to
be
unraveled
they
made
no
further
discoveries
and
even
joyce
expressed
herself
as
completely
discouraged
there
just
one
thing
that
seems
to
me
thoroughly
foolish
cynthia
continued
it
your
still
insisting
that
we
keep
from
mentioning
the
house
to
outsiders
good
gracious
do
you
think
they
all
going
to
suspect
that
we
inside
here
every
other
day
just
because
you
happen
to
speak
of
the
place
if
you
do
it
your
guilty
conscience
troubling
you
cynthia
had
never
spoken
quite
so
sharply
before
joyce
looked
up
a
little
hurt
why
cynthia
what
the
matter
with
you
one
would
think
i
been
doing
something
the
way
you
speak
oh
i
did
mean
it
that
way
explained
cynthia
contritely
but
you
do
know
how
this
remembering
to
speak
of
it
has
got
on
my
nerves
i
catch
myself
a
dozen
times
a
day
just
going
to
make
some
innocent
remark
about
the
generally
at
the
table
and
then
i
stutter
and
blush
and
they
all
ask
what
the
matter
and
i
do
know
what
in
the
world
to
answer
now
i
have
an
idea
perhaps
it
is
worth
anything
mine
generally
are
but
it
this
why
would
it
be
a
good
scheme
to
get
the
older
folks
to
talk
about
this
house
without
letting
them
know
you
have
any
special
interest
in
it
just
start
the
subject
somehow
i
notice
folks
are
liable
to
talk
quite
a
long
while
on
most
any
subject
that
started
and
they
might
have
something
to
say
that
would
interest
us
and
we
get
some
new
clues
and
i
see
any
reason
why
they
should
connect
us
with
it
specially
joyce
considered
the
subject
in
thoughtful
silence
i
believe
you
right
she
said
at
last
it
is
silly
to
continue
keeping
so
about
it
and
we
might
get
some
good
new
points
anyhow
in
the
detective
stories
sherlock
holmes
did
keep
everything
so
quiet
but
talked
to
lots
of
outside
people
and
got
ideas
that
way
too
why
did
i
think
of
it
before
good
old
cynthia
you
had
the
right
notion
that
time
come
let
go
home
now
i
tired
and
sick
of
this
dusty
grubbing
and
we
not
going
to
do
any
more
of
it
next
morning
joyce
came
flying
over
to
cynthia
house
half
an
hour
before
it
was
time
to
start
for
high
school
she
seemed
rather
excited
come
on
do
hurry
cyn
i
something
important
to
tell
you
but
it
is
time
to
start
yet
objected
cynthia
and
i
only
half
through
breakfast
tell
me
here
joyce
gave
her
a
warning
glance
before
turning
away
oh
later
will
do
she
remarked
casually
and
strolled
into
the
to
chat
with
sprague
this
was
sufficient
to
hasten
cynthia
who
usually
loved
to
linger
cozily
over
her
morning
meal
she
had
her
hat
and
coat
on
and
her
books
under
her
arm
inside
of
seven
minutes
and
the
two
girls
hurried
away
together
they
were
no
sooner
down
the
steps
than
joyce
began
last
night
an
idea
came
to
me
just
through
some
remark
that
father
happened
to
make
it
queer
we
never
thought
of
it
before
there
a
agent
over
the
other
side
of
the
town
wade
and
he
ought
to
know
everything
about
all
the
property
here
that
his
business
let
go
to
his
office
and
ask
him
about
the
old
house
he
does
know
us
and
wo
suspect
anything
we
go
this
afternoon
right
after
school
but
there
a
meeting
of
the
sigma
sigma
society
this
afternoon
cynthia
remonstrated
and
they
going
to
give
that
little
play
crazy
to
see
it
i
do
care
cried
joyce
recklessly
what
the
meeting
of
an
old
literary
society
compared
to
an
important
thing
like
this
but
we
could
do
it
just
as
well
i
ca
wait
till
cynthia
sprague
and
that
settled
the
matter
they
started
on
their
expedition
that
very
afternoon
it
was
a
bleak
raw
day
and
they
found
wade
huddled
over
a
stove
in
his
little
office
he
stared
at
them
in
some
surprise
as
they
entered
pardon
me
began
joyce
always
the
spokesman
but
i
like
to
ask
a
question
or
two
about
the
old
house
on
orchard
avenue
now
the
agent
was
apparently
not
in
the
best
of
spirits
that
day
business
had
been
very
dull
he
had
two
children
at
home
sick
with
measles
and
he
himself
was
in
the
first
stage
of
a
cold
i
do
know
anything
about
it
he
mumbled
crossly
it
ai
in
the
market
never
was
oh
we
do
want
to
it
or
it
explained
joyce
politely
we
only
wanted
to
know
if
you
knew
the
owners
where
they
live
and
what
their
names
are
no
i
do
he
reiterated
tried
to
find
out
once
it
some
estate
business
all
transacted
through
lawyers
in
new
york
and
they
open
their
heads
about
it
plain
as
told
me
it
was
none
of
my
affairs
then
perhaps
you
could
tell
us
joyce
was
persisting
when
the
agent
suddenly
interrupted
turning
on
her
suspiciously
say
what
do
you
want
to
know
all
this
for
what
the
old
place
to
you
anyhow
oh
nothing
nothing
at
all
protested
joyce
alarmed
lest
their
precious
secret
was
about
to
be
discovered
we
only
asked
out
of
curiosity
good
day
sir
and
the
two
girls
fled
precipitately
from
the
office
i
was
going
to
ask
him
the
name
of
the
lawyers
joyce
explained
as
they
hurried
away
but
it
would
do
any
good
i
guess
if
we
knew
we
could
go
and
question
for
it
plain
from
what
the
agent
said
that
they
do
want
to
talk
about
it
my
but
that
man
was
cranky
was
he
i
think
he
was
sick
said
cynthia
he
looked
it
well
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
give
it
all
up
we
tried
just
about
everything
suddenly
she
stopped
and
stood
perfectly
still
staring
blankly
at
nothing
come
on
urged
joyce
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
standing
here
like
that
i
was
just
thinking
seems
to
me
i
remember
something
about
the
first
day
we
got
into
the
did
you
tell
me
that
you
knew
the
house
was
left
furnished
that
somebody
had
told
your
father
so
why
cried
joyce
excited
at
once
i
certainly
did
and
what
a
stupid
i
am
not
to
have
thought
of
it
since
and
she
herself
stopped
short
and
stood
thinking
well
what
is
it
demanded
cynthia
impatiently
who
stopping
and
staring
now
the
trouble
is
said
joyce
slowly
that
the
whole
thing
not
very
clear
in
my
mind
it
was
several
years
ago
that
i
heard
father
mention
it
somebody
was
visiting
us
when
we
first
moved
here
and
asked
him
at
the
table
about
the
old
house
next
door
and
father
said
i
think
that
he
did
know
anything
much
about
it
only
that
it
was
a
queer
old
place
and
once
he
had
met
an
elderly
lady
who
happened
to
mention
to
him
that
she
knew
the
house
was
left
furnished
just
as
it
was
and
she
did
think
the
owners
would
ever
live
in
it
again
i
do
know
why
i
happened
to
remember
this
it
must
have
made
quite
an
impression
on
me
because
i
was
a
good
deal
younger
and
did
generally
listen
much
to
what
they
were
saying
at
table
well
announced
cynthia
still
standing
where
she
had
stopped
and
speaking
with
great
positiveness
there
only
one
thing
to
do
now
and
that
is
find
out
who
the
old
lady
is
and
hunt
her
up
i
suppose
i
can
find
out
her
name
from
father
if
he
remembers
it
but
what
then
i
ca
go
and
scrape
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
perfectly
strange
person
and
she
live
in
timbuctoo
objected
joyce
it
the
only
thing
left
the
resort
as
they
say
in
stories
said
cynthia
but
of
course
you
can
do
as
you
like
engineering
this
business
well
i
will
conceded
joyce
not
very
hopefully
however
i
lead
father
round
to
talking
of
her
this
evening
if
i
can
and
see
what
comes
of
it
joyce
was
as
good
as
her
word
that
evening
when
she
and
her
father
were
seated
cozily
in
the
library
she
studying
her
father
smoking
and
reading
his
paper
while
her
mother
was
temporarily
out
of
the
room
she
began
diplomatically
illustration
do
you
know
any
real
elderly
people
father
do
you
know
any
real
elderly
people
father
he
looked
up
with
a
quizzical
expression
well
a
few
most
people
do
do
they
what
do
you
inquire
for
duckie
thinking
of
founding
an
old
people
home
he
asked
teasingly
oh
no
but
who
are
they
father
do
you
mind
telling
me
mercy
joyce
i
ca
think
just
now
of
all
of
them
he
was
deep
in
a
preëlection
article
in
his
paper
and
wanted
to
return
to
it
but
ca
you
think
of
just
a
she
implored
well
you
are
the
queerest
child
there
grandfather
lambert
and
your
lucia
and
old
selby
and
oh
i
ca
think
joyce
what
all
this
foolishness
anyway
joyce
saw
at
once
that
she
was
getting
at
nothing
very
definite
along
this
line
and
determined
on
a
bold
move
well
who
is
the
old
lady
that
you
spoke
of
once
who
you
said
knew
something
about
that
queer
old
house
next
door
now
why
in
the
world
did
you
say
so
at
once
without
first
making
me
go
through
the
whole
list
of
my
elderly
acquaintances
he
laughed
that
was
your
lucia
joyce
almost
shouted
in
her
astonishment
why
certainly
what
queer
about
that
she
used
to
live
in
new
york
city
and
knew
all
the
best
families
for
miles
around
when
we
first
moved
here
next
to
that
ramshackle
old
place
i
remember
her
telling
me
she
known
the
people
who
used
to
live
there
who
were
they
demanded
joyce
eagerly
oh
i
do
remember
their
name
i
do
know
that
she
ever
mentioned
it
she
only
said
she
knew
them
and
they
gone
away
rather
suddenly
and
left
their
house
all
furnished
and
never
came
back
now
let
me
finish
my
paper
in
peace
duckie
dear
joyce
said
no
more
and
turned
again
to
her
studies
but
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
and
she
could
not
concentrate
her
thoughts
on
her
work
lucia
of
all
people
and
here
she
had
been
wondering
how
she
could
ever
get
to
know
some
stranger
well
enough
to
put
her
questions
but
for
that
matter
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
of
questioning
even
lucia
she
was
a
very
old
lady
a
confirmed
invalid
who
lived
in
poughkeepsie
for
many
years
she
had
not
left
her
home
and
the
family
seldom
saw
her
but
her
father
paid
a
visit
to
the
old
lady
once
in
a
while
when
he
was
in
that
vicinity
joyce
then
fell
to
planning
how
she
could
get
into
communication
with
this
lucia
she
could
her
inquiries
that
certainly
would
never
do
if
she
could
only
visit
her
and
get
her
to
talk
about
it
but
joyce
had
never
visited
this
relative
in
her
life
and
never
particularly
wanted
to
and
it
would
appear
strange
to
seem
suddenly
so
anxious
to
see
the
old
lady
this
however
was
obviously
the
only
solution
and
she
began
to
wonder
how
it
could
be
arranged
very
prudently
she
waited
till
her
father
had
finished
his
pipe
and
laid
aside
his
paper
then
she
commenced
afresh
but
casually
as
though
the
idea
had
just
entered
her
mind
lucia
must
be
a
very
interesting
old
lady
father
she
is
she
certainly
is
i
was
always
very
fond
of
her
my
how
she
can
talk
and
the
stories
she
can
tell
about
old
times
said
kenway
waxing
enthusiastic
oh
i
i
could
visit
her
exclaimed
joyce
well
you
certainly
may
if
you
really
want
to
i
always
wanted
her
to
see
you
since
you
grown
so
and
i
proposed
a
number
of
times
that
you
go
with
me
on
the
trip
but
you
always
refused
to
be
separated
from
your
precious
cynthia
and
i
could
think
of
inflicting
youngsters
on
her
joyce
remembered
now
with
a
good
deal
of
how
many
times
she
had
begged
off
from
accompanying
her
father
it
had
not
seemed
very
interesting
then
and
as
he
had
said
she
did
not
want
to
leave
cynthia
even
for
two
or
three
days
she
realized
now
that
she
had
not
only
been
a
little
selfish
about
it
but
had
plainly
missed
a
golden
opportunity
oh
father
she
cried
in
real
contrition
i
was
mean
to
refuse
you
i
did
realize
that
you
me
to
go
i
thought
you
only
did
it
to
give
me
a
good
time
and
somehow
it
did
seem
like
a
good
time
then
when
are
you
going
again
and
wo
you
take
me
i
have
been
there
in
two
years
he
mused
i
to
go
again
soon
the
old
lady
may
not
live
very
long
she
so
feeble
let
see
suppose
we
make
it
the
before
election
i
write
to
her
that
we
all
coming
you
and
mother
and
i
oh
but
father
exclaimed
joyce
could
we
go
sooner
nearly
a
month
off
best
i
can
do
duckie
dear
i
simply
ca
get
away
before
what
your
hurry
anyway
first
you
wo
be
hired
to
go
and
see
her
and
then
you
want
to
rush
off
and
do
it
at
once
what
a
funny
little
daughter
it
is
he
kissed
her
laughingly
as
she
bade
him
good
night
but
joyce
slept
little
that
night
she
was
wild
for
morning
to
come
so
that
she
could
tell
cynthia
and
wilder
with
impatience
to
think
of
the
long
dragging
month
ahead
before
the
visit
to
lucia
and
the
solution
of
the
mystery
chapter
ix
the
memories
of
lucia
cynthia
sat
at
her
desk
in
high
school
alternately
staring
out
of
the
window
gazing
intently
across
the
room
at
joyce
and
scowling
at
the
blackboard
where
the
cryptic
symbols
a
b
were
being
laboriously
expounded
by
the
professor
of
mathematics
of
this
exposition
it
is
safe
to
say
cynthia
comprehended
not
a
word
for
the
following
simple
reason
early
that
morning
joyce
had
returned
from
the
visit
to
her
lucia
and
had
entered
the
late
cynthia
had
not
yet
had
a
moment
in
which
to
speak
with
her
alone
it
was
now
the
last
period
of
the
day
and
her
impatience
had
completely
conquered
her
usual
absorbed
attention
to
her
studies
the
professor
droned
on
the
class
feverishly
copied
more
cryptic
symbols
in
its
notebooks
but
at
last
the
rang
and
after
what
seemed
interminable
and
totally
unnecessary
delays
cynthia
found
herself
out
of
doors
with
joyce
then
all
she
could
find
to
say
was
now
but
joyce
was
very
serious
and
very
mysterious
too
not
here
she
answered
i
could
wait
well
where
and
when
then
cried
cynthia
home
said
joyce
then
after
a
moment
no
i
tell
you
in
the
house
that
the
most
appropriate
place
we
go
there
straight
after
we
get
home
so
cynthia
was
obliged
to
repress
her
impatience
a
little
longer
but
at
length
they
had
crept
through
the
cellar
window
lighted
their
candles
and
were
proceeding
come
into
the
library
said
joyce
i
want
to
stand
right
where
i
can
look
at
the
lovely
lady
when
i
tell
you
this
it
all
so
strange
so
from
what
we
thought
so
they
went
through
the
entered
the
library
and
placed
their
candlesticks
on
the
mantel
where
the
light
would
best
illuminate
the
portrait
of
the
lovely
lady
then
joyce
began
lucia
is
very
old
and
very
feeble
she
seemed
glad
to
see
us
all
especially
me
she
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
but
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
mention
this
place
to
her
at
all
till
the
last
evening
we
were
there
mother
and
father
had
gone
out
to
call
on
some
friends
but
it
was
raining
and
i
had
a
sore
throat
so
they
decided
not
to
take
me
i
was
so
glad
because
then
i
could
stay
home
and
talk
to
lucia
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
been
with
her
long
alone
she
had
been
telling
me
a
lot
about
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
asking
me
about
myself
and
i
had
told
her
about
you
and
how
we
been
together
so
many
years
and
what
we
did
when
we
were
in
school
and
finally
i
mentioned
just
casually
that
we
often
played
in
the
grounds
of
this
old
house
next
door
and
described
the
place
a
little
to
her
well
that
started
her
as
i
was
sure
it
would
she
began
telling
me
that
it
was
so
strange
that
she
had
been
in
this
house
once
and
curiously
enough
just
before
it
was
closed
for
good
then
you
can
warrant
i
listened
with
all
my
ears
she
said
she
had
become
acquainted
with
the
lady
through
meeting
her
a
short
time
before
at
the
house
of
a
friend
in
new
york
this
friend
had
then
introduced
them
hubert
kenway
fairfax
collingwood
collingwood
cried
cynthia
and
we
thought
she
married
well
she
was
and
we
made
several
mistakes
beside
that
cynthia
sprague
as
you
find
out
later
it
seems
that
lucia
took
quite
a
fancy
to
young
collingwood
she
was
so
sweet
and
gracious
and
charmingly
pretty
later
lucia
discovered
that
she
was
a
widow
living
out
here
her
husband
had
been
dead
a
number
of
years
ten
i
think
she
was
a
southerner
having
come
originally
from
south
carolina
lucia
did
not
see
her
again
till
a
few
weeks
later
when
she
received
an
invitation
to
go
with
her
friend
take
luncheon
and
spend
the
day
at
collingwood
there
were
several
others
invited
about
a
dozen
in
all
they
all
came
out
by
train
and
drove
here
in
hired
carriages
from
the
station
which
was
a
long
way
off
then
it
was
a
beautiful
soft
balmy
april
day
and
spring
seemed
well
begun
lucia
said
the
place
was
delightful
an
old
colonial
house
it
seemed
so
strange
to
hear
her
describe
everything
just
as
we
seen
it
and
collingwood
was
a
charming
hostess
but
they
were
just
finishing
luncheon
when
the
strangest
thing
happened
a
servant
came
in
and
handed
collingwood
a
telegram
as
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
she
excused
herself
to
them
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
it
then
to
their
astonishment
she
turned
first
a
fiery
red
and
afterward
white
as
a
sheet
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
saying
in
a
sort
of
stifled
voice
everyone
jumped
up
too
some
so
quickly
that
they
knocked
over
their
chairs
and
asked
if
anything
dreadful
was
the
matter
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
toppled
over
and
slipped
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
did
i
you
so
long
ago
exclaimed
cynthia
i
she
probably
fainted
yes
you
were
right
well
two
or
three
began
to
chafe
her
hands
and
face
and
the
rest
sent
the
servants
flying
for
and
vinegar
everything
was
confusion
for
a
few
minutes
till
she
presently
came
to
then
they
all
began
again
to
question
her
about
what
was
the
matter
but
she
would
tell
them
she
just
said
had
bad
news
dear
friends
and
it
has
made
me
feel
quite
ill
it
is
something
i
can
not
speak
about
i
hope
you
will
not
think
me
thoroughly
inhospitable
if
i
go
to
my
room
for
a
while
they
all
told
her
she
must
certainly
go
and
lie
down
and
that
they
would
leave
immediately
she
begged
them
not
to
hurry
but
of
course
they
saw
that
it
was
best
to
stay
since
she
would
let
them
do
anything
for
her
so
fifteen
minutes
later
they
were
all
driving
away
in
the
carriages
which
had
remained
for
them
at
the
house
and
here
joyce
paused
dramatically
not
one
of
them
except
my
friend
durand
ever
saw
her
again
but
but
began
cynthia
wait
said
joyce
i
have
finished
yet
of
course
all
of
them
were
crazy
to
know
what
happened
but
most
of
them
never
did
not
till
long
long
afterward
anyway
there
was
one
that
did
know
soon
however
and
that
was
durand
two
nights
afterward
durand
was
astounded
to
have
collingwood
arrive
at
her
house
in
new
york
and
beg
to
be
allowed
to
stay
there
a
day
or
two
she
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
carried
only
a
small
grip
of
course
durand
took
her
right
in
and
that
night
collingwood
told
her
what
had
happened
but
first
i
must
tell
you
that
collingwood
had
a
son
gasped
cynthia
staring
up
at
the
girlish
picture
yes
a
son
and
not
a
baby
either
but
a
fine
handsome
young
fellow
of
seventeen
lucia
says
that
collingwood
was
married
when
she
was
only
seventeen
and
that
she
was
when
all
this
happened
but
she
looked
much
younger
so
that
accounts
for
our
mistake
the
son
was
away
at
harvard
college
or
at
least
they
he
was
at
the
time
of
the
luncheon
but
lucia
says
that
the
same
afternoon
as
they
were
driving
to
the
station
they
met
a
splendid
young
fellow
with
yellow
hair
and
bright
brown
eyes
hurrying
along
the
road
in
the
opposite
direction
he
took
off
his
cap
to
them
gaily
and
durand
whispered
that
it
was
young
fairfax
collingwood
evidently
coming
home
unexpectedly
lucia
says
she
will
never
forget
his
excited
happy
look
now
i
go
back
to
durand
and
collingwood
and
all
that
follows
durand
told
lucia
long
long
long
afterward
collingwood
came
into
the
house
and
her
face
looked
set
like
a
stone
and
she
seemed
twenty
years
older
than
when
she
was
having
the
luncheon
and
durand
cried
my
dear
you
have
lost
some
one
you
are
dressed
in
mourning
said
collingwood
have
lost
my
son
i
am
going
away
and
durand
said
oh
how
how
sudden
he
ca
be
we
saw
him
and
collingwood
answered
is
dead
to
me
and
for
the
longest
time
durand
could
get
another
word
from
her
except
that
she
had
shut
up
the
house
and
was
going
home
south
to
live
for
good
well
durand
put
her
right
to
bed
she
was
fairly
sick
with
nervousness
and
exhaustion
and
late
that
night
she
broke
down
and
cried
and
cried
and
told
durand
everything
and
oh
cynthia
do
you
think
it
was
you
never
guess
you
know
the
civil
war
had
just
broken
out
fort
sumter
had
surrendered
and
collingwood
was
a
south
carolina
woman
and
was
heart
and
soul
with
the
confederacy
she
had
married
a
northern
man
and
had
lived
ever
since
up
here
but
that
did
make
any
difference
and
all
the
time
war
had
been
threatening
she
had
been
planning
to
raise
a
company
in
south
carolina
for
her
son
fairfax
and
put
him
in
command
of
it
they
did
those
things
at
that
time
her
son
did
know
about
it
however
she
was
keeping
the
news
to
surprise
him
and
then
that
day
at
luncheon
she
received
a
telegram
from
him
saying
he
had
left
college
and
enlisted
the
union
and
was
coming
home
at
once
to
bid
her
before
going
to
the
front
the
shock
of
it
almost
killed
her
but
later
she
thought
that
surely
when
he
came
she
could
persuade
him
out
of
it
and
he
came
that
very
afternoon
the
ladies
had
met
him
walking
up
from
the
train
she
would
not
tell
durand
just
what
happened
but
intimated
that
they
had
had
a
dreadful
scene
you
see
the
young
fellow
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
the
north
and
sympathies
were
all
with
side
and
he
was
just
as
enthusiastic
about
it
as
his
mother
was
about
the
other
and
besides
she
never
talked
to
him
much
about
the
southern
cause
so
he
did
realize
how
she
felt
at
last
when
he
would
give
in
she
admitted
to
durand
that
she
disowned
him
and
told
him
never
to
see
her
face
again
when
he
had
gone
to
his
room
to
pack
his
things
she
went
and
dismissed
her
servants
and
told
them
to
go
at
once
then
she
locked
herself
in
her
room
till
her
boy
went
away
she
never
saw
him
again
after
he
had
gone
that
night
she
collected
all
her
silver
and
hid
it
and
partially
packed
her
own
things
and
then
decided
she
would
take
them
with
her
and
when
she
had
gone
around
shutting
up
the
house
it
was
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
she
went
out
and
got
an
old
colored
carpenter
who
lived
nearby
to
come
and
board
up
the
windows
and
doors
she
had
the
boarding
all
in
the
cellar
for
it
had
been
made
two
years
before
when
she
went
to
europe
for
six
months
it
took
him
nearly
all
day
to
finish
the
work
while
she
stood
around
and
gave
directions
i
do
see
how
she
had
the
strength
to
do
it
when
it
was
all
done
she
locked
the
door
walked
to
the
station
took
the
train
for
new
york
and
came
to
mrs
durand
joyce
paused
in
her
recital
from
sheer
lack
of
breath
and
cynthia
took
advantage
of
the
silence
so
was
the
way
of
it
and
thought
it
was
her
brother
and
that
he
done
something
awful
committed
a
robbery
or
forged
something
i
do
see
why
that
young
fairfax
should
have
been
treated
so
i
think
what
he
did
was
fine
you
must
remember
said
joyce
that
people
felt
so
differently
about
such
things
in
those
days
we
ca
quite
realize
it
now
and
judge
them
for
the
way
they
acted
i
suppose
collingwood
could
have
forgiven
him
more
easily
if
he
committed
a
burglary
instead
and
lucia
says
she
was
terribly
too
i
understand
it
even
so
insisted
cynthia
but
did
your
say
anything
about
those
pictures
no
but
i
asked
her
if
collingwood
had
any
other
children
and
she
said
she
understood
that
fairfax
had
been
a
twin
but
his
little
sister
had
died
when
she
was
much
more
than
three
years
old
so
that
the
explanation
of
the
two
babies
in
the
other
room
i
suppose
collingwood
did
tell
all
in
fact
i
said
she
did
tell
any
details
about
what
happened
that
night
probably
she
turned
the
portrait
around
and
tore
out
the
miniature
when
she
was
alone
but
i
have
finished
my
story
yet
oh
do
go
on
then
implored
cynthia
collingwood
stayed
at
her
friend
house
two
days
continued
joyce
and
then
left
for
her
old
home
in
a
little
town
in
south
carolina
and
never
came
north
again
durand
never
saw
her
again
either
but
used
to
hear
from
her
at
very
long
intervals
but
where
the
awful
thing
comes
in
after
the
battle
of
shiloh
a
year
later
when
the
papers
published
the
list
of
killed
fairfax
collingwood
name
was
among
the
first
so
he
did
not
live
very
long
you
see
but
what
a
terrible
thing
for
the
poor
mother
to
think
that
she
and
her
son
had
parted
in
anger
and
now
were
never
never
to
meet
again
and
make
it
all
up
oh
i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
it
joyce
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
she
gazed
up
at
the
proud
beautiful
face
above
them
well
that
the
end
of
the
story
and
that
the
tragedy
and
mystery
about
this
house
oh
there
one
other
thing
lucia
says
she
thinks
collingwood
is
still
alive
a
very
old
lady
living
down
in
the
little
old
south
carolina
town
of
chesterton
she
will
never
allow
this
old
house
to
be
touched
nor
let
any
one
enter
it
but
she
has
made
a
will
leaving
it
to
the
southern
society
when
she
dies
that
positively
all
and
you
see
everything
is
explained
no
it
is
retorted
cynthia
you
have
explained
thing
at
all
what
that
asked
joyce
the
mystery
of
the
room
replied
cynthia
chapter
x
an
exciting
discovery
the
autumn
of
that
year
ended
the
winter
months
came
and
went
with
all
their
holiday
festivities
and
spring
entered
in
her
appointed
time
the
passing
winter
had
been
filled
with
such
varied
outside
activities
for
the
two
girls
that
there
was
little
time
to
think
of
the
house
and
still
less
to
do
any
further
investigating
within
it
added
to
that
the
cold
had
been
so
constant
and
intense
that
it
would
have
been
unsafe
to
venture
into
the
unlighted
unheated
and
unventilated
old
mansion
but
in
spite
of
these
things
its
haunting
story
was
never
out
of
their
minds
for
long
and
they
discussed
and
it
in
many
a
spare
hour
when
they
crouched
cozily
by
themselves
over
the
open
fire
during
that
long
winter
it
was
a
wonderful
and
appealing
secret
that
they
somehow
felt
was
all
their
own
it
was
better
more
interesting
than
the
most
engrossing
story
they
had
ever
read
and
the
fascination
of
it
was
that
though
they
now
knew
so
much
they
did
not
yet
know
all
the
mystery
of
the
locked
room
always
confronted
them
always
lured
them
on
once
on
a
day
that
was
unusually
mild
they
ventured
into
the
old
house
for
a
few
moments
and
looked
long
and
intently
at
the
lovely
lady
over
the
library
mantel
and
at
the
two
pretty
children
in
the
yes
that
is
the
boy
said
cynthia
you
can
see
even
there
what
a
fine
young
fellow
he
must
have
made
with
those
big
brown
eyes
and
that
curly
golden
hair
oh
the
poor
mother
how
she
must
have
grieved
all
these
years
you
can
see
that
she
has
never
gotten
over
it
or
she
would
have
come
back
here
sometime
i
wonder
if
she
is
alive
yet
in
the
library
joyce
picked
up
the
paper
that
had
been
discovered
through
the
help
of
goliath
and
looked
it
over
curiously
why
in
the
world
did
we
this
paper
when
we
found
it
she
exclaimed
disgustedly
just
see
here
the
big
headlines
sumter
surrenders
war
formally
declared
troops
rushing
to
washington
why
cynthia
it
would
surely
have
given
us
the
clue
i
do
think
it
would
have
declared
cynthia
sceptically
i
never
would
have
connected
anything
in
the
paper
with
what
happened
here
sherlock
holmes
would
have
mused
joyce
well
anyway
we
got
at
the
story
in
another
fashion
but
oh
cynthia
will
we
ever
know
about
the
room
as
cynthia
could
cast
no
further
light
on
this
vexed
question
they
were
forced
to
drop
it
then
came
spring
and
the
ancient
in
the
enclosure
back
of
the
house
blossomed
anew
one
brilliant
saturday
morning
early
in
may
the
girls
clambered
through
the
fence
with
their
books
and
to
spend
some
of
the
shining
hour
under
the
white
canopy
of
blossoms
they
were
reading
aloud
the
sign
of
four
they
inclined
much
toward
mystery
and
detective
stories
at
this
time
turn
and
turn
about
while
the
one
who
not
have
the
book
sewed
or
embroidered
presently
joyce
laid
down
the
volume
with
a
big
sigh
illustration
oh
i
i
were
sherlock
holmes
oh
i
i
were
sherlock
holmes
mercy
what
for
cried
cynthia
i
sure
do
why
do
you
suppose
sherlock
would
have
been
all
this
time
getting
at
the
final
facts
about
our
house
of
course
not
he
have
had
it
all
worked
out
and
proved
by
now
joyce
got
to
her
feet
and
began
roaming
about
restlessly
suddenly
she
stopped
in
front
of
her
companion
i
tell
you
cynthia
it
me
i
ca
explain
to
you
why
but
i
feel
there
is
something
we
have
discovered
yet
something
we
to
know
it
is
just
curiosity
as
professor
marlow
would
call
it
i
never
knew
or
heard
of
anything
that
went
so
so
in
me
as
this
thing
has
that
poor
loving
proud
mother
and
her
terrible
misunderstanding
with
her
splendid
son
he
was
too
i
help
but
think
but
was
she
in
the
wrong
i
suppose
we
ca
judge
about
how
people
felt
in
those
days
the
whole
thing
is
so
different
now
all
forgotten
and
forgiven
but
i
read
that
the
confederates
considered
their
cause
almost
a
a
so
of
course
she
would
have
felt
the
shock
of
what
her
son
did
terribly
and
think
how
he
must
have
felt
too
and
then
to
lose
his
life
almost
in
the
beginning
perhaps
he
and
his
mother
might
have
made
it
all
up
after
the
war
was
over
if
he
only
lived
it
it
the
saddest
thing
i
ever
heard
cynthia
had
risen
too
and
they
linked
arms
strolling
up
and
down
the
little
orchard
as
they
talked
i
feel
exactly
as
you
do
about
it
though
i
do
often
speak
of
it
said
cynthia
but
by
the
way
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
we
might
find
it
interesting
to
look
over
some
of
the
books
in
that
old
library
some
of
them
looked
very
attractive
to
me
and
even
if
it
did
lead
to
anything
at
least
it
would
be
good
fun
to
examine
them
i
love
old
books
why
not
do
it
this
afternoon
just
the
thing
agreed
joyce
i
thought
of
that
too
but
never
had
much
chance
to
do
it
till
now
this
afternoon
right
after
lunch
so
the
afternoon
found
them
again
in
the
dim
musty
old
library
illuminating
the
scene
extravagantly
with
five
candles
three
sides
of
the
room
were
lined
with
reaching
nearly
to
the
ceiling
the
girls
surveyed
the
bewildering
rows
of
books
puzzled
where
to
begin
oh
come
over
here
decided
joyce
choosing
the
side
opposite
the
fireplace
these
big
volumes
look
so
interesting
she
brushed
the
thick
dust
off
their
backs
revealing
the
titles
look
they
all
alike
with
red
backs
and
mottled
sides
she
opened
one
curiously
why
they
called
what
a
strange
name
what
kind
of
books
can
they
be
and
then
on
further
examination
oh
i
see
it
a
collection
of
english
papers
full
of
jokes
and
politics
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
this
one
is
from
way
back
in
why
cynthia
these
are
the
most
things
but
cynthia
had
already
extracted
another
volume
and
was
absorbed
in
it
chuckling
softly
over
the
humor
joyce
grouped
the
five
candles
on
the
floor
and
they
sat
down
beside
them
from
time
to
time
pulling
out
fresh
volumes
reading
aloud
clever
jokes
to
each
other
and
enjoying
themselves
immensely
utterly
unconscious
of
the
passing
moments
at
length
they
found
they
had
skimmed
through
all
the
volumes
of
punch
the
last
of
which
was
dated
and
had
them
piled
up
on
the
floor
beside
them
this
left
a
long
space
on
the
shelf
from
which
they
came
and
the
methodical
cynthia
presently
rose
to
put
them
back
as
she
fitted
in
the
first
volume
her
eye
was
suddenly
caught
by
something
back
of
the
shelves
illuminated
in
the
flickering
joyce
come
here
she
called
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
excitement
and
joyce
who
had
wandered
to
another
corner
came
over
in
a
hurry
what
is
it
look
in
there
joyce
snatched
a
candle
and
held
it
close
to
the
opening
made
by
the
books
then
she
gave
a
long
low
whistle
what
do
you
make
of
it
demanded
cynthia
just
what
it
is
and
that
as
as
a
pikestaff
a
cynthia
nodded
yes
but
what
a
strange
place
for
it
back
of
those
shelves
they
brought
another
candle
and
examined
the
wall
back
of
the
shelves
more
carefully
there
was
certainly
a
keyhole
a
rather
small
one
and
around
it
what
appeared
to
be
the
paneling
of
a
door
only
partially
visible
through
the
shreds
of
old
torn
that
had
once
covered
it
i
have
it
cried
joyce
at
length
at
least
i
think
this
may
be
an
explanation
that
a
small
door
without
a
doubt
perhaps
to
some
unused
closet
maybe
there
was
a
time
when
this
house
was
new
when
this
room
was
a
library
then
somebody
wanted
to
make
it
into
a
library
and
fill
all
this
side
of
the
room
with
but
that
door
was
in
the
way
so
they
had
it
all
papered
over
and
just
put
the
shelves
in
front
of
it
as
though
it
had
never
been
there
you
see
the
paper
has
fallen
away
probably
through
dampness
and
the
mice
seem
to
have
eaten
it
too
and
here
the
keyhole
is
it
we
just
happened
to
take
the
books
out
that
were
in
front
of
it
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
questioned
cynthia
why
there
just
one
thing
to
do
and
that
is
move
the
shelves
out
somehow
they
seem
to
be
movable
just
resting
on
those
and
get
at
that
door
but
suppose
it
locked
we
have
to
take
a
chance
on
that
come
on
we
ca
move
these
books
and
shelves
away
fast
enough
to
suit
me
they
fell
to
work
with
a
zest
the
like
of
which
they
had
not
known
since
their
first
entrance
into
the
house
it
was
no
easy
task
to
remove
the
armfuls
of
books
necessary
to
get
at
the
door
behind
and
then
push
and
shove
and
struggle
with
the
dusty
shelves
in
a
comparatively
short
time
however
the
floor
behind
them
was
littered
with
volumes
hastily
deposited
and
the
shelves
for
a
space
nearly
as
high
as
their
heads
were
removed
then
they
tore
at
the
mouldy
shreds
of
till
the
entire
frame
of
the
paneled
wooden
doorway
was
free
handle
there
was
none
it
having
doubtless
been
removed
when
the
place
was
papered
there
seemed
consequently
no
way
to
open
the
door
but
cynthia
was
equal
to
this
emergency
i
seen
an
old
chisel
in
the
kitchen
we
might
pry
it
open
with
that
she
suggested
go
and
get
it
commanded
joyce
bursting
with
excitement
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
either
a
secret
cupboard
or
room
cynthia
seized
a
candle
and
hurried
away
coming
back
breathless
with
the
rusty
tool
now
for
it
muttered
joyce
she
grasped
the
chisel
and
inserted
it
in
the
crack
pushing
on
it
with
all
her
might
but
the
door
resisted
and
cynthia
was
just
uttering
the
despairing
cry
oh
it
locked
too
when
it
suddenly
gave
way
with
a
wholly
unexpected
jerk
and
flew
open
emitting
a
cloud
of
dust
mercy
exclaimed
joyce
between
two
sneezes
that
almost
knocked
me
off
my
feet
did
you
ever
see
so
much
dust
snatching
the
candles
again
they
both
sprang
forward
expecting
to
gaze
into
the
dusty
interior
of
some
long
unused
cupboard
or
closet
they
had
no
sooner
put
their
heads
into
the
opening
than
they
started
back
with
a
simultaneous
cry
the
door
opened
on
a
tiny
narrow
stairway
ascending
into
the
dimness
above
chapter
xi
the
room
that
was
locked
before
cynthia
could
realize
what
had
happened
or
was
happening
joyce
seized
her
and
began
waltzing
madly
around
the
library
alternately
laughing
sobbing
hugging
and
shaking
her
distractedly
stop
stop
joyce
she
begged
breathlessly
have
you
gone
crazy
you
act
so
what
is
the
matter
you
ask
me
panted
joyce
you
great
big
why
we
discovered
the
way
to
the
room
what
the
matter
cynthia
looked
incredulous
why
certainly
continued
joyce
ca
you
you
know
that
room
is
right
over
this
where
else
could
those
stairs
lead
then
but
come
along
we
settle
all
doubts
in
a
moment
she
snatched
up
a
candle
again
and
led
the
way
cynthia
following
without
more
ado
oh
joyce
it
horribly
dirty
and
stuffy
and
cobwebby
in
here
could
we
wait
a
few
moments
till
some
air
gets
in
implored
cynthia
in
a
muffled
voice
i
wait
a
moment
but
you
may
if
you
wish
called
back
joyce
but
i
know
you
wo
mind
your
head
these
are
the
tiniest
lowest
stairs
i
ever
seen
they
continued
to
crawl
slowly
up
their
candles
flickering
low
in
the
impoverished
air
of
the
place
what
if
we
ca
open
the
door
at
the
top
conjectured
cynthia
what
if
it
behind
some
heavy
piece
of
furniture
we
just
to
get
in
somehow
responded
joyce
i
gone
so
far
now
that
i
believe
i
be
willing
to
break
things
open
with
a
charge
of
dynamite
if
we
could
get
in
any
other
way
here
i
am
at
the
top
now
you
hold
my
candle
and
we
see
what
happens
she
handed
her
candle
to
cynthia
braced
herself
and
threw
her
whole
weight
against
the
low
door
which
was
knobless
like
the
one
below
then
came
the
surprise
she
had
expected
resistance
and
prepared
to
cope
with
it
to
her
utter
amazement
there
was
a
ripping
tearing
sound
and
she
found
herself
suddenly
prone
upon
the
floor
of
the
most
mysterious
room
in
the
house
the
reason
for
this
being
that
the
door
at
the
top
was
covered
on
the
inner
side
with
only
a
layer
or
two
of
and
no
article
of
furniture
happened
to
stand
in
front
of
it
consequently
it
had
yielded
with
ease
at
the
tremendous
shove
joyce
had
given
it
and
she
found
herself
thus
forcibly
and
ignominiously
propelled
into
the
apartment
my
she
gasped
sitting
up
and
dusting
her
hands
but
that
was
sudden
i
do
care
though
i
not
a
bit
hurt
and
we
they
were
indeed
in
the
mysterious
locked
room
was
at
last
to
yield
up
its
secret
to
them
they
experienced
a
delicious
thrill
of
expectation
as
with
their
candles
raised
above
their
heads
they
peered
eagerly
about
now
what
they
had
expected
to
find
within
that
mysterious
room
they
could
not
perhaps
have
explained
with
any
definiteness
once
they
stood
within
the
threshold
however
they
became
slowly
conscious
of
a
vague
disappointment
here
was
nothing
so
very
strange
after
all
the
room
appeared
to
be
in
considerable
disorder
and
articles
of
clothing
books
and
boyish
belongings
were
tossed
about
as
in
a
hurry
of
packing
but
beyond
this
there
was
nothing
much
out
of
the
ordinary
about
it
well
breathed
cynthia
at
length
is
what
we
been
making
all
the
fuss
about
wait
said
joyce
you
ca
see
everything
just
at
one
glance
look
about
a
little
oh
what
a
dreadful
hole
we
made
in
the
well
it
ca
be
helped
now
and
it
the
only
damage
done
they
commenced
to
tiptoe
about
the
room
glancing
curiously
at
its
contents
it
was
plainly
a
boy
room
a
pair
of
hung
crossed
on
one
wall
a
couple
of
on
another
college
trophies
decorated
the
mantel
on
a
stood
a
photograph
or
daguerreotype
in
a
large
oval
frame
when
cynthia
had
wiped
away
the
veil
of
dust
that
covered
it
with
the
she
had
thoughtfully
tucked
in
her
belt
the
girls
bent
over
it
oh
cynthia
cried
joyce
here
they
are
the
lovely
lady
and
her
boy
he
must
have
been
about
twelve
then
what
funny
clothes
he
wore
but
is
he
handsome
and
see
how
proudly
she
looks
at
him
cynthia
how
he
bear
to
leave
this
behind
i
should
have
thought
he
ever
want
to
part
with
it
probably
he
went
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
could
think
of
everything
and
left
this
by
mistake
or
he
may
even
have
had
another
copy
cynthia
added
in
a
practical
garments
of
many
descriptions
and
all
of
cut
were
flung
across
the
bed
and
on
the
floor
near
it
lay
an
open
valise
half
packed
with
books
he
had
to
leave
that
too
you
see
or
perhaps
he
intended
to
send
for
it
later
commented
joyce
possibly
he
did
realize
that
his
mother
was
going
to
shut
up
the
house
and
leave
it
forever
here
his
big
desk
and
in
pretty
good
order
too
i
suppose
he
had
used
it
much
as
he
was
so
little
at
home
it
open
though
she
began
to
dust
the
top
where
a
row
of
were
arranged
and
presently
came
to
the
which
she
was
about
to
polish
off
conscientiously
suddenly
she
paused
stared
rubbed
at
something
with
her
duster
and
bending
close
stared
again
in
a
moment
she
raised
her
head
and
called
in
a
low
voice
cynthia
come
here
cynthia
who
had
been
carefully
dusting
the
college
trophies
on
the
mantel
hurried
to
her
side
what
is
it
what
have
you
found
joyce
only
pointed
to
a
large
sheet
of
paper
lying
on
the
blotter
it
was
yellow
with
age
and
covered
with
writing
in
faded
ink
writing
in
a
big
round
boyish
hand
it
began
my
dearest
mother
cynthia
drew
back
with
a
jerk
scrupulously
honorable
as
usual
ought
we
to
read
it
joyce
it
a
letter
i
did
whispered
joyce
i
could
help
it
for
i
did
realize
what
it
was
at
first
i
do
think
it
will
harm
oh
cynthia
it
and
cynthia
doubting
no
longer
read
aloud
my
dearest
mother
the
best
and
loveliest
thing
in
my
life
i
leave
this
last
appeal
here
in
the
hope
that
you
will
see
it
later
read
it
and
forgive
me
we
have
had
bitter
words
but
i
am
leaving
you
with
no
anger
in
my
heart
and
nothing
but
love
that
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
in
this
life
i
feel
certain
therefore
i
want
you
to
know
that
to
my
last
hour
i
shall
love
you
truly
devotedly
i
am
so
sure
i
am
right
and
i
have
pledged
my
word
i
can
not
take
back
my
promise
i
never
dreamed
that
you
feel
as
you
do
about
this
cause
my
mother
my
own
mother
forgive
me
and
god
keep
you
your
son
fairfax
when
cynthia
had
ended
there
was
a
big
lump
in
joyce
throat
and
cynthia
herself
coughed
and
flourished
a
handkerchief
about
her
face
with
suspicious
ostentation
suddenly
she
burst
out
i
think
that
woman
must
have
had
a
a
heart
of
to
be
so
unforgiving
to
her
son
after
reading
this
never
saw
it
announced
joyce
with
a
positiveness
that
made
cynthia
stare
i
like
to
know
how
you
can
say
a
thing
like
that
cynthia
demanded
at
once
it
lay
right
there
for
her
to
see
how
do
you
account
for
this
room
being
locked
parried
joyce
answering
the
question
yankee
fashion
by
asking
another
cynthia
pondered
a
moment
i
account
for
it
but
why
of
course
the
boy
locked
it
after
him
when
he
went
away
and
took
the
key
with
him
joyce
regarded
her
with
scorn
that
be
a
sensible
thing
to
do
now
would
it
he
writes
a
note
that
he
is
hoping
with
all
his
heart
that
his
mother
will
see
then
he
calmly
locks
the
door
and
walks
off
with
the
key
what
for
if
he
did
do
it
who
did
cynthia
defended
herself
not
the
servants
they
went
before
he
did
probably
there
only
one
person
left
his
mother
you
struck
it
at
last
what
a
good
guesser
you
are
said
joyce
witheringly
then
she
relented
yes
she
must
have
done
it
cynthia
she
locked
the
door
and
took
the
key
away
or
did
something
with
it
though
what
on
earth
i
ca
imagine
but
what
makes
you
think
she
did
it
she
read
the
note
demanded
cynthia
there
are
just
two
reasons
cynthia
she
could
have
been
if
she
read
that
letter
and
not
gone
to
work
at
once
and
made
every
effort
to
reach
her
son
but
there
one
other
thing
that
makes
me
do
you
see
anything
about
this
room
cynthia
gazed
about
her
critically
then
she
replied
why
no
i
ca
seem
to
see
anything
so
perhaps
i
know
what
you
mean
then
i
tell
you
look
at
the
windows
are
they
like
the
ones
in
the
rest
of
the
house
oh
no
cried
cynthia
now
i
see
the
curtains
are
not
drawn
or
the
shutters
closed
it
just
dark
because
it
boarded
up
outside
that
precisely
it
announced
joyce
you
see
she
must
have
gone
around
closing
all
the
other
inside
shutters
tight
but
she
never
touched
them
in
this
room
therefore
she
probably
never
came
in
here
the
desk
is
right
by
the
window
she
could
have
helped
seeing
the
letter
if
she
had
come
in
no
for
some
reason
we
ca
guess
she
locked
the
door
and
never
knew
and
she
never
never
will
know
whispered
cynthia
that
the
saddest
part
of
it
chapter
xii
a
slight
disagreement
the
friday
afternoon
meeting
of
the
sigma
sigma
literary
society
broke
up
with
the
usual
confused
mingling
of
chatter
and
laughter
there
had
been
a
lively
debate
and
joyce
and
cynthia
as
two
of
the
opponents
had
just
finished
roundly
and
wordily
belaboring
each
other
they
entwined
arms
now
amiably
enough
and
strolled
away
to
collect
their
books
and
leave
for
home
out
on
the
street
cynthia
suddenly
began
do
you
know
we
never
had
that
illumination
in
the
house
that
we
planned
last
fall
when
we
commenced
cleaning
up
there
we
never
had
enough
money
for
candles
replied
joyce
yes
i
know
but
still
i
always
wanted
to
do
it
suppose
we
buy
some
and
try
it
soon
say
joyce
turned
to
her
companion
with
an
astonished
stare
why
cynthia
sprague
you
it
near
the
end
of
the
month
and
i
down
to
fifteen
cents
again
and
i
guess
you
are
much
better
off
what
nonsense
i
have
two
dollars
and
a
half
i
been
saving
it
up
ever
so
long
not
for
that
specially
but
i
perfectly
willing
to
use
it
for
that
well
you
are
the
queerest
one
exclaimed
joyce
who
would
have
thought
you
care
so
much
about
it
of
course
i
willing
to
go
in
for
it
but
i
ca
give
my
share
till
after
the
first
of
the
month
why
do
you
want
to
do
it
so
soon
oh
i
do
know
just
because
i
replied
cynthia
a
little
confused
in
manner
come
let
buy
the
candles
right
off
and
suppose
we
do
a
little
dusting
and
cleaning
up
in
the
morning
and
fix
the
candles
in
the
candelabrum
and
in
the
afternoon
light
them
up
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
them
joyce
agreed
to
this
heartily
and
they
turned
into
a
store
to
purchase
the
candles
much
to
joyce
amazement
cynthia
insisted
on
investing
in
the
best
ones
she
could
obtain
though
they
cost
nearly
five
cents
apiece
tallow
ones
will
do
whispered
joyce
aghast
at
such
extravagance
but
cynthia
shook
her
head
and
came
away
with
more
than
fifty
i
wanted
them
she
said
and
joyce
could
not
budge
her
from
this
position
then
to
change
the
subject
which
was
plainly
becoming
embarrassing
to
her
cynthia
abruptly
remarked
do
forget
joyce
that
you
are
coming
over
to
my
house
to
dinner
and
this
evening
we
do
our
studying
so
that
we
can
have
the
whole
day
free
and
bring
your
music
over
too
perhaps
we
have
time
to
practise
that
duet
afterward
i
will
agreed
joyce
and
she
turned
in
at
her
own
gate
joyce
came
over
that
evening
bringing
her
books
and
music
as
and
sprague
were
occupying
the
the
two
girls
decided
to
work
in
the
and
accordingly
spread
out
their
books
and
papers
all
over
the
big
round
table
cynthia
settled
down
methodically
and
studiously
as
was
her
wont
but
joyce
happened
to
be
in
one
of
her
humors
so
cynthia
always
called
them
when
she
found
it
quite
impossible
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
or
give
her
serious
attention
to
anything
these
moods
were
always
particularly
irritating
to
cynthia
who
rarely
indulged
in
causeless
hilarity
especially
at
study
periods
prudently
however
she
made
no
remarks
let
commence
with
geometry
she
suggested
opening
the
here
we
are
at
proposition
xvi
all
right
assented
joyce
with
deceptive
sweetness
give
me
a
pencil
and
paper
please
cynthia
handed
them
to
her
and
began
angle
a
equals
angle
b
a
equals
b
murmured
joyce
after
her
joyce
i
wish
you
would
say
that
interrupted
cynthia
sharply
why
not
inquired
joyce
with
pretended
surprise
at
the
same
time
decorating
the
corners
of
her
diagram
with
cherubic
heads
and
wings
because
it
confuses
me
so
i
ca
think
said
cynthia
please
call
things
by
their
right
names
but
it
makes
no
difference
with
the
proof
what
you
call
things
in
geometry
argued
joyce
whether
it
angles
or
angels
or
caterpillars
or
it
all
the
same
in
the
end
cynthia
ignored
this
swallowed
her
rising
wrath
and
doggedly
began
anew
angle
a
equals
angle
b
but
joyce
who
was
a
born
tease
could
no
more
resist
the
temptation
of
baiting
cynthia
than
she
could
have
refused
a
chocolate
soda
so
she
continued
to
make
foolish
and
irrelevant
comments
on
every
geometrical
statement
until
in
sheer
exasperation
cynthia
threw
the
book
aside
it
no
use
she
groaned
you
not
in
a
studying
frame
of
mind
joyce
certainly
not
for
geometry
i
go
over
that
myself
monday
morning
but
what
going
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
and
i
do
much
care
but
we
got
to
get
through
somehow
let
try
the
algebra
you
always
like
that
do
you
think
you
could
put
your
mind
on
it
i
try
grinned
joyce
in
feigned
contrition
i
make
the
greatest
effort
but
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
i
actually
working
hard
cynthia
opened
her
algebra
picked
out
the
problem
and
read
farmer
sold
acres
when
joyce
suddenly
interrupted
do
you
know
cynthia
i
heard
the
most
interesting
problem
the
other
day
i
wonder
if
you
could
solve
it
what
is
it
asked
cynthia
thankful
for
any
awakening
symptom
of
interest
in
her
difficult
friend
why
this
repeated
joyce
with
great
gravity
it
takes
an
elephant
ten
minutes
to
put
on
a
white
vest
how
many
pancakes
will
it
take
to
shingle
a
cynthia
indignation
was
rapidly
waxing
hotter
but
she
made
one
more
tremendous
effort
to
control
it
joyce
i
told
you
that
i
was
serious
about
this
studying
but
so
am
i
insisted
the
wicked
joyce
now
let
try
to
work
that
out
let
equal
the
number
of
pancakes
the
end
of
patience
had
come
however
she
pushed
the
books
aside
joyce
kenway
you
are
i
wish
you
would
go
home
well
i
wo
retorted
joyce
giggling
inwardly
but
i
leave
you
to
your
own
devices
if
you
like
and
she
rose
from
the
table
walked
with
great
dignity
to
a
distant
seated
herself
in
it
and
pretended
to
read
the
daily
paper
which
she
had
removed
from
its
seat
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
covertly
in
cynthia
direction
but
there
was
no
sign
of
relenting
in
that
young
lady
she
was
indeed
too
deeply
indignant
and
moreover
had
immersed
herself
in
her
work
presently
joyce
gave
up
trying
to
attract
her
attention
and
began
to
read
the
paper
in
real
earnest
a
thing
which
she
seldom
had
the
time
or
the
interest
to
do
there
was
a
long
silence
in
the
room
broken
only
by
the
scratch
of
cynthia
pencil
or
the
rustling
of
a
turned
page
suddenly
joyce
looked
up
cynthia
she
began
her
voice
sounded
different
now
it
had
lost
its
teasing
tone
and
seemed
a
little
muffled
but
cynthia
was
obdurate
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
she
reiterated
i
wish
you
go
home
very
well
cynthia
i
will
answered
joyce
quietly
and
she
gathered
up
her
books
and
belongings
giving
her
friend
a
queer
look
as
she
left
the
room
without
another
word
later
cynthia
put
away
her
work
yawned
and
rose
from
the
table
she
was
beginning
to
feel
just
a
trifle
sorry
that
she
had
been
so
short
with
her
beloved
friend
but
joyce
was
simply
impossible
she
mused
i
never
knew
her
to
be
quite
so
foolish
hope
she
is
really
offended
but
have
forgotten
all
about
it
by
morning
i
wonder
where
paper
is
joyce
was
reading
it
or
pretending
to
i
want
to
see
the
weather
report
for
i
hope
it
going
to
be
fair
pshaw
i
ca
find
it
she
must
have
gathered
it
up
with
her
things
and
taken
it
with
her
that
was
mighty
careless
but
just
like
joyce
going
to
bed
chapter
xiii
the
great
illumination
the
next
morning
the
two
girls
met
as
though
absolutely
nothing
unpleasant
had
happened
these
little
differences
were
as
a
fact
of
frequent
occurrence
and
neither
of
them
ever
cherished
the
least
grudge
toward
the
other
when
they
were
over
not
a
word
was
said
in
reference
to
it
by
either
but
cynthia
noticed
joyce
looking
at
her
rather
curiously
several
times
finally
she
asked
what
are
you
staring
at
me
so
for
joyce
oh
nothing
i
was
staring
joyce
replied
and
began
to
talk
of
something
else
by
the
way
cyn
why
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
wait
till
next
week
before
we
have
our
illumination
perhaps
we
could
get
more
candles
by
that
time
too
i
vote
for
next
saturday
instead
of
i
ca
see
why
you
want
to
wait
replied
cynthia
is
just
as
good
a
time
as
any
in
fact
i
think
it
better
something
might
happen
that
would
entirely
prevent
it
next
week
no
let
have
it
my
heart
is
set
on
it
very
well
then
assented
joyce
but
do
you
know
i
believe
if
this
time
is
a
success
we
might
have
it
again
next
saturday
too
well
you
can
have
it
if
you
like
and
if
you
can
raise
the
money
for
candles
laughed
cynthia
but
you
must
depend
on
me
i
be
out
by
that
time
that
morning
they
carefully
dusted
the
and
library
of
the
house
we
put
the
candles
in
the
in
the
big
candelabrum
that
will
take
about
forty
and
we
have
enough
for
the
library
too
said
cynthia
planning
the
campaign
and
the
rest
of
the
candles
we
put
in
the
room
let
go
right
up
there
now
and
dust
it
oh
what
do
you
want
to
light
room
for
cried
joyce
let
go
in
there
it
makes
me
blue
even
to
think
of
it
but
cynthia
was
obdurate
i
want
it
lit
up
she
announced
if
you
do
feel
like
going
up
i
go
myself
i
do
mind
but
i
want
candles
there
oh
if
you
insist
of
course
i
go
but
really
cynthia
i
quite
understand
you
you
want
to
do
such
queer
things
i
do
see
anything
about
that
retorted
cynthia
blushing
hotly
it
just
seemed
somehow
appropriate
but
joyce
in
spite
of
her
protests
accompanied
cynthia
up
the
tiny
cramped
stairway
the
entrance
to
which
they
had
not
blocked
by
restoring
the
what
a
strange
thing
it
is
this
secret
stairway
she
marveled
aloud
i
sure
it
a
secret
stairway
and
that
it
was
long
unused
even
before
collingwood
left
here
i
even
feel
pretty
certain
that
she
never
knew
it
was
here
how
do
you
figure
that
out
questioned
cynthia
well
in
several
ways
for
one
thing
because
it
was
all
closed
up
and
papered
over
that
could
have
been
done
before
she
came
here
and
you
know
she
only
lived
in
this
house
eighteen
years
but
mainly
because
there
would
have
been
much
sense
in
her
locking
up
the
room
if
she
lock
it
had
she
known
there
was
another
easy
way
of
getting
into
it
no
i
somehow
do
think
she
knew
they
did
their
dusting
in
the
room
and
tried
to
make
it
look
as
as
possible
carefully
avoiding
however
the
vicinity
of
the
desk
cynthia
arranged
six
candles
in
holders
ready
to
light
and
they
went
down
stairs
again
to
arrange
the
others
a
task
that
was
accomplished
with
some
difficulty
as
the
candelabrum
was
rather
high
and
they
were
obliged
to
stand
on
chairs
at
last
all
was
ready
and
they
hurried
home
to
luncheon
agreeing
to
meet
at
two
for
the
great
illumination
when
they
returned
that
afternoon
cynthia
had
smuggled
over
the
which
they
found
a
boon
indeed
in
lighting
so
many
candles
at
such
a
height
when
every
tongue
of
flame
was
sparkling
softly
the
girls
stepped
back
to
admire
the
result
is
it
the
prettiest
thing
you
ever
saw
cried
joyce
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
it
beats
a
all
hollow
i
always
heard
that
was
the
loveliest
of
all
artificial
illumination
and
now
i
believe
it
just
see
how
this
room
is
positively
transformed
we
never
those
pictures
properly
before
now
it
looks
as
it
did
fifty
years
ago
said
cynthia
softly
of
course
houses
lighted
by
gas
then
but
only
city
ones
or
those
near
the
city
i
know
because
i
been
asking
about
it
other
people
had
to
use
horrid
but
there
were
who
kept
on
having
candles
because
they
preferred
that
kind
of
light
especially
in
and
evidently
this
was
one
of
them
joyce
eyed
her
curiously
you
certainly
been
interested
in
the
question
of
illumination
half
a
century
ago
but
cynthia
i
never
knew
you
to
go
so
deeply
into
anything
of
this
kind
before
cynthia
started
and
blushed
again
do
you
think
so
she
stammered
oh
well
it
only
because
this
this
house
has
taken
hold
of
me
somehow
i
ca
get
it
out
of
my
mind
day
or
night
yes
cried
joyce
and
i
remember
the
day
when
i
could
hardly
induce
you
to
enter
it
i
just
had
to
you
in
and
you
disputed
every
inch
of
the
way
that
the
way
with
me
returned
cynthia
i
not
quick
about
going
into
things
but
once
i
you
ca
get
me
out
and
nothing
i
ever
knew
of
has
made
me
feel
as
this
house
has
now
i
going
to
light
the
candles
in
the
room
that
the
one
thing
ca
understand
protested
joyce
as
they
climbed
the
tiny
stairs
once
more
you
seem
perfectly
crazy
about
that
room
and
it
makes
me
so
so
that
i
hate
to
go
near
it
i
like
the
library
and
the
picture
of
the
lovely
lady
best
illustration
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sit
and
enjoy
the
spectacle
cynthia
did
not
reply
to
this
but
lit
the
candles
and
gave
a
last
look
about
then
they
returned
to
the
as
there
was
nothing
further
to
do
but
sit
and
enjoy
the
spectacle
the
two
girls
cuddled
down
on
a
roomy
old
couch
or
sofa
and
watched
with
all
the
fascination
that
one
watches
the
soft
illumination
of
a
sometimes
they
talked
in
low
voices
commenting
on
the
scene
then
they
would
be
silent
for
a
long
period
simply
drinking
it
in
and
trying
to
photograph
it
forever
on
their
memories
joyce
frankly
and
openly
enjoyed
it
all
but
cynthia
seemed
nervous
and
restless
she
began
at
length
to
wriggle
about
got
up
twice
and
walked
around
restlessly
and
looked
at
her
watch
again
and
again
i
wonder
how
long
these
candles
will
last
questioned
joyce
glancing
at
her
own
timepiece
they
are
a
third
gone
yet
oh
i
could
sit
here
and
look
at
this
for
hours
it
all
so
different
from
anything
we
ever
seen
that
exclaimed
cynthia
suddenly
and
joyce
straightened
up
to
listen
more
intently
i
do
hear
anything
what
the
matter
with
you
cynthia
sprague
i
do
know
i
nervous
i
guess
there
i
hear
something
it
was
joyce
who
spoke
the
queerest
good
gracious
cynthia
just
suppose
somebody
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
get
in
here
of
times
and
find
this
going
on
but
cynthia
was
not
listening
to
joyce
she
was
straining
her
ears
in
another
direction
there
it
is
again
somebody
is
at
that
front
door
cried
joyce
i
believe
they
must
have
seen
these
lights
through
some
chink
in
the
boarding
and
are
breaking
in
to
find
out
what
the
matter
perhaps
they
think
something
gave
with
a
long
resounding
noise
and
the
two
girls
clasped
each
other
in
an
agony
of
terror
it
came
from
the
front
door
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
and
somebody
had
just
succeeded
in
opening
the
little
door
in
the
boarding
there
was
still
the
big
main
door
to
pass
come
quick
quick
whispered
joyce
it
will
do
for
us
to
be
found
here
we
might
be
arrested
for
trespassing
let
slip
down
cellar
and
out
through
the
window
and
perhaps
we
can
get
away
without
being
seen
never
mind
the
candles
they
never
know
who
put
them
there
hurry
she
clutched
at
cynthia
expecting
instant
acquiescence
but
to
her
amazement
cynthia
stood
firm
and
boldly
declared
no
joyce
i
not
going
to
run
away
even
if
we
got
out
without
being
seen
they
be
sure
to
discover
us
sooner
or
later
we
left
enough
of
our
things
around
for
that
i
going
to
meet
whoever
it
is
and
tell
them
we
have
done
any
real
harm
and
so
must
you
all
during
this
speech
they
could
hear
the
rattle
of
some
one
working
at
the
lock
of
the
main
door
and
a
second
after
cynthia
finished
it
yielded
with
another
loud
crack
next
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
hall
by
this
time
joyce
was
so
paralyzed
with
fright
that
she
could
scarcely
move
a
limb
and
speech
had
entirely
deserted
her
they
were
caught
as
in
a
trap
there
was
no
escape
now
it
was
a
horrible
position
cynthia
however
pulled
her
to
her
feet
come
she
ordered
we
better
meet
them
and
face
it
out
joyce
could
only
marvel
at
her
astonishing
coolness
who
had
always
been
the
most
timid
and
of
mortals
at
this
instant
the
door
was
pushed
open
chapter
xiv
the
meddling
of
cynthia
to
joyce
the
moment
that
the
door
was
pushed
open
will
always
seem
with
perhaps
one
exception
the
most
intense
of
all
her
life
she
fully
expected
to
see
a
man
stride
in
more
likely
half
a
dozen
and
demand
the
meaning
of
the
unwarrantable
intrusion
and
illumination
instead
of
that
the
slight
figure
of
a
woman
dressed
all
in
black
and
with
a
long
heavy
dark
veil
over
her
face
stepped
into
the
room
for
a
moment
she
paused
surprised
uncertain
almost
trembling
then
with
a
firm
movement
she
threw
back
her
veil
and
in
the
soft
light
of
the
candles
stood
revealed
joyce
gave
a
tiny
gasp
in
all
her
life
she
had
never
seen
so
beautiful
an
old
lady
masses
of
soft
wavy
white
hair
framed
a
face
of
singular
charm
despite
its
age
and
the
biggest
saddest
brown
eyes
in
all
the
world
looked
out
inquiringly
on
the
two
girls
there
was
complete
silence
the
three
could
hear
each
other
breathe
then
the
newcomer
spoke
which
of
you
two
friends
was
it
may
i
ask
who
sent
me
the
letter
her
voice
was
sweet
and
low
and
soft
and
as
sad
as
her
eyes
joyce
gave
a
start
and
opened
her
lips
to
speak
but
cynthia
was
before
her
did
she
announced
calmly
the
lady
turned
to
her
that
was
very
lovely
of
you
and
very
thoughtful
i
began
planning
to
come
soon
after
i
received
it
and
tried
to
arrive
at
about
the
time
you
mentioned
but
i
do
not
quite
understand
all
all
this
she
glanced
toward
the
burning
candles
and
i
afraid
i
do
not
understand
how
you
how
you
came
to
be
in
here
oh
began
cynthia
stumblingly
i
i
could
quite
explain
it
all
in
a
letter
and
i
did
even
know
you
pay
any
attention
to
what
i
wrote
anyway
but
we
tell
you
all
about
it
right
now
if
you
care
to
hear
a
light
was
beginning
to
dawn
on
the
bewildered
joyce
suddenly
she
sprang
forward
and
seized
the
lady
hand
tell
me
oh
please
tell
me
she
cried
you
mrs
collingwood
yes
my
dear
said
the
lady
and
to
the
amazement
of
every
one
joyce
broke
down
and
began
to
sob
hysterically
exclaiming
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
between
every
other
sob
i
think
i
sit
down
said
collingwood
when
joyce
had
regained
control
of
herself
i
very
tired
and
very
very
bewildered
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
drew
each
of
the
girls
down
beside
her
now
tell
me
she
said
to
cynthia
explain
it
all
and
then
show
me
what
you
think
will
interest
me
so
you
see
i
have
traveled
many
weary
miles
to
hear
this
strange
story
so
cynthia
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
how
they
had
first
found
their
way
in
and
had
then
become
interested
in
unraveling
the
mystery
of
the
old
house
collingwood
listened
with
deep
attention
but
when
cynthia
reached
the
tale
of
the
hidden
stairway
she
started
in
surprise
why
i
never
dreamed
there
was
such
a
thing
in
the
house
she
exclaimed
the
rooms
were
once
but
i
was
away
when
it
was
done
none
of
us
knew
no
we
thought
you
did
continued
cynthia
and
so
we
went
into
the
room
and
there
we
found
something
oh
mrs
collingwood
we
felt
sure
you
had
never
seen
it
and
that
you
to
you
see
we
knew
all
the
rest
of
the
the
story
from
joyce
lucia
kenway
and
we
felt
you
to
see
it
at
least
felt
that
way
and
so
i
wrote
you
the
letter
i
did
even
tell
joyce
i
done
it
because
because
i
was
afraid
she
think
i
was
in
what
did
concern
me
but
i
could
help
it
i
could
sleep
nights
till
i
sent
that
letter
because
it
all
haunted
me
so
i
just
sent
it
to
chesterton
south
carolina
because
that
was
all
the
address
i
knew
i
did
even
feel
sure
it
would
ever
reach
you
and
i
set
a
special
date
for
you
to
get
here
on
purpose
because
well
because
i
thought
we
ought
to
be
here
to
receive
you
and
have
the
place
look
sort
of
homelike
it
would
be
terrible
seems
to
me
to
come
back
to
a
dark
deserted
house
that
you
left
so
long
ago
and
nobody
here
to
to
welcome
you
well
that
all
i
guess
but
collingwood
so
afraid
we
have
done
right
that
we
meddled
in
what
was
no
business
of
ours
and
trespassed
in
a
house
we
should
never
have
entered
i
only
hope
you
can
forgive
us
thus
ended
cynthia
brokenly
and
collingwood
put
out
her
hands
to
take
a
hand
of
each
girl
in
her
clasp
you
dear
little
meddlers
she
exclaimed
this
is
all
so
astonishing
to
me
but
i
feel
sure
nevertheless
that
you
have
done
nothing
but
good
and
now
will
you
will
you
show
me
what
you
spoke
of
cynthia
rose
handed
her
a
lighted
candle
and
led
her
to
the
opening
of
the
little
stairway
in
the
library
it
up
these
stairs
in
the
room
above
on
the
desk
she
said
you
will
find
it
all
lit
up
there
and
i
think
that
you
would
rather
go
alone
collingwood
took
the
candle
and
cynthia
helped
her
into
the
opening
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
then
she
went
back
to
joyce
when
they
were
alone
the
two
girls
stood
staring
at
one
another
and
cynthia
cheeks
grew
fiery
red
i
do
know
what
what
you
must
think
of
me
joyce
she
stammered
i
ought
never
to
have
done
this
i
suppose
without
telling
you
why
did
you
tell
me
demanded
joyce
why
i
was
so
afraid
you
think
me
silly
and
and
meddling
and
you
might
approve
of
it
i
was
unhappy
i
somehow
felt
as
though
committed
a
crime
and
the
only
way
to
right
it
was
this
how
long
ago
did
you
send
your
letter
asked
joyce
presently
cynthia
considered
i
think
i
posted
it
a
week
ago
thursday
and
you
knew
all
the
time
last
night
that
this
was
going
to
happen
asked
joyce
incredulously
well
i
sort
of
expected
it
that
is
i
really
did
know
whether
she
come
or
not
it
made
me
dreadfully
nervous
and
that
the
reason
i
was
so
cross
to
you
joyce
i
suppose
will
you
forgive
me
now
that
you
know
why
of
course
said
joyce
then
suddenly
but
oh
i
known
this
all
at
the
time
what
for
what
difference
would
it
have
made
demanded
cynthia
but
joyce
only
replied
hush
is
that
collingwood
coming
down
chapter
xv
the
stranger
at
the
door
collingwood
remained
a
long
time
so
long
indeed
that
the
girls
began
to
be
rather
uneasy
fearing
that
she
had
fainted
or
perhaps
was
ill
or
overcome
they
knew
not
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
up
asked
cynthia
anxiously
perhaps
she
needs
help
no
i
think
she
just
wants
to
be
by
herself
it
was
fine
of
you
cynthia
to
send
her
up
alone
i
really
do
believe
i
have
thought
of
it
at
length
they
heard
her
coming
slowly
down
and
presently
she
reëntered
the
they
could
see
that
she
was
much
moved
and
had
evidently
been
crying
she
did
not
speak
to
them
at
once
but
went
and
stood
by
the
mantel
looking
up
long
and
earnestly
at
the
portrait
of
the
twins
my
babies
they
heard
her
murmur
unconsciously
aloud
at
last
however
she
came
to
them
and
sat
down
once
more
between
them
on
the
sofa
they
wondered
nervously
what
she
was
going
to
say
my
little
girls
she
began
forgive
me
you
seem
little
and
young
to
me
though
i
suppose
you
consider
yourselves
almost
young
ladies
but
you
see
i
am
an
old
woman
i
was
going
to
tell
you
a
little
about
my
life
but
i
suppose
you
already
know
most
of
the
important
things
thanks
to
lucia
she
patted
joyce
hand
there
are
some
things
however
that
perhaps
you
do
not
know
and
after
what
you
have
done
for
me
you
deserve
to
i
was
married
when
i
was
a
very
young
girl
only
seventeen
i
was
a
southerner
but
my
husband
came
from
the
north
and
brought
me
up
north
here
to
live
i
always
hated
it
this
northern
life
and
though
i
loved
my
husband
dearly
i
hated
his
devotion
to
it
we
never
agreed
about
those
questions
when
my
twin
babies
were
born
i
secretly
determined
that
they
should
be
southerners
in
spirit
and
southerners
i
planned
that
when
they
were
both
old
enough
they
should
marry
in
the
south
and
live
there
and
my
husband
and
i
with
them
but
in
this
life
things
seldom
turn
out
as
we
plan
my
little
girl
died
before
she
was
three
and
i
had
scarcely
become
reconciled
to
this
grief
when
my
husband
was
also
taken
from
me
so
i
centered
all
my
hopes
on
my
son
on
fairfax
as
he
grew
older
however
and
as
the
civil
war
came
nearer
i
noticed
that
he
talked
more
and
more
in
sympathy
with
the
north
and
this
distressed
me
terribly
however
i
thought
it
best
not
to
say
much
about
it
to
him
for
he
was
a
headstrong
boy
and
had
always
resented
opposition
and
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
see
things
differently
when
he
was
older
i
wished
to
send
him
to
a
southern
college
but
he
begged
me
to
send
him
to
harvard
as
his
heart
was
so
set
on
it
i
could
deny
him
thinking
that
even
this
would
make
little
difference
in
the
end
then
came
the
crisis
in
the
country
affairs
and
the
confederacy
was
declared
i
had
already
begun
to
correspond
with
southern
authorities
to
arrange
about
raising
a
company
for
fairfax
i
never
doubted
that
he
would
comply
with
my
wishes
but
i
little
knew
him
i
hardly
need
to
tell
you
of
the
awful
day
that
he
came
home
you
are
already
acquainted
with
the
history
of
it
that
afternoon
shortly
after
he
arrived
we
had
our
interview
i
have
always
possessed
the
most
violent
temper
a
mortal
had
to
struggle
with
and
in
those
earlier
years
when
i
got
into
a
rage
it
blinded
me
to
everything
else
to
every
other
earthly
consideration
and
during
that
interview
well
need
i
say
it
fairfax
was
simply
immovable
gentle
and
loving
always
but
i
could
no
more
impress
him
with
my
wishes
than
i
could
have
moved
the
rock
of
gibraltar
the
galling
part
to
me
was
that
he
kept
insisting
he
was
only
doing
what
was
right
how
he
be
right
when
it
was
all
directly
contrary
but
never
mind
that
now
i
have
learned
differently
with
the
passing
sorrowful
years
but
to
go
back
i
stood
it
as
long
as
i
could
and
then
i
turned
from
him
disowned
him
bade
him
leave
the
house
at
once
and
never
see
my
face
again
and
informed
him
that
i
myself
would
abandon
the
place
on
the
morrow
and
return
to
the
south
he
left
me
without
another
word
and
went
to
his
room
i
immediately
summoned
the
servants
and
dismissed
them
on
the
spot
giving
them
only
time
to
get
their
things
together
and
go
then
i
locked
myself
in
my
room
till
he
was
gone
he
came
several
times
knocked
at
my
door
and
begged
me
to
see
him
but
i
would
not
heaven
forgive
me
i
would
not
so
he
must
have
left
me
that
note
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
a
moment
then
she
went
on
i
never
saw
or
knew
of
it
till
this
day
if
i
had
just
at
this
point
they
were
all
startled
by
a
loud
knock
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
front
door
so
unexpected
was
the
sound
that
they
could
only
stare
at
each
other
inquiringly
without
stirring
in
a
moment
it
came
again
a
thumping
of
the
old
knocker
on
the
front
inner
door
i
guess
i
better
go
said
joyce
some
one
may
have
seen
the
little
door
open
you
leave
it
open
she
asked
turning
to
collingwood
i
think
i
did
i
was
too
hurried
and
nervous
when
i
came
in
to
think
of
it
that
it
then
some
one
has
seen
it
open
and
has
stopped
to
inquire
if
everything
is
all
right
she
hurried
away
to
the
front
door
and
after
an
effort
succeeded
in
pulling
it
open
a
man
a
complete
stranger
to
her
stood
outside
they
regarded
each
other
with
mutual
surprise
pardon
me
he
said
but
perhaps
you
can
inform
me
is
any
one
living
in
this
house
at
present
why
no
replied
joyce
rather
confusedly
that
is
no
the
house
is
empty
except
just
just
oh
er
i
see
the
fact
is
the
stranger
went
on
i
was
passing
here
and
noticed
this
outer
door
open
which
seemed
a
little
queer
i
used
to
know
the
people
who
lived
here
very
well
indeed
and
i
have
been
wondering
whether
the
house
was
still
in
their
possession
it
seemed
to
be
untenanted
at
his
mention
of
knowing
the
family
joyce
looked
him
over
with
considerably
more
interest
he
was
tall
straight
and
robust
though
rather
verging
on
the
elderly
his
hair
was
crisply
curly
and
his
dark
eyes
twinkled
out
from
under
bushy
gray
brows
his
smile
was
captivating
joyce
decided
at
once
that
she
liked
him
oh
did
you
know
the
family
the
the
collingwoods
he
supplemented
with
his
twinkling
smile
yes
i
knew
them
quite
intimately
might
i
perhaps
if
it
would
not
be
intruding
come
in
just
a
moment
to
look
once
more
at
the
old
place
that
is
he
added
hastily
seeing
her
hesitate
only
if
it
would
be
entirely
convenient
i
do
not
know
of
course
why
the
house
is
open
perhaps
people
are
are
about
to
purchase
it
joyce
was
for
a
moment
with
perplexity
she
hated
to
refuse
the
simple
wish
of
this
pleasant
stranger
yet
how
was
she
to
comply
with
it
considering
the
presence
of
collingwood
and
the
almost
unexplainable
position
of
herself
and
cynthia
what
would
he
think
of
it
all
while
she
was
hesitating
an
idea
came
to
her
there
is
one
of
the
family
here
on
on
business
she
said
at
last
if
you
will
give
me
your
name
i
will
ask
if
that
person
would
like
to
see
you
oh
that
is
hardly
worth
while
he
said
hastily
my
name
is
calthorpe
but
i
sure
they
would
remember
me
after
all
this
time
and
i
do
not
wish
to
trouble
them
but
joyce
had
excused
herself
and
turned
away
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
name
leaving
him
standing
there
collingwood
however
shook
her
head
when
joyce
announced
who
was
outside
i
do
not
remember
any
one
named
calthorpe
and
i
scarcely
feel
that
i
can
see
a
stranger
now
but
we
must
not
be
inhospitable
miss
cynthia
and
i
will
go
and
sit
in
the
library
and
you
can
bring
him
into
the
a
few
moments
there
is
no
other
part
of
the
house
that
can
very
well
be
shown
she
took
cynthia
arm
walked
into
the
library
and
partly
closed
the
door
while
joyce
went
out
to
admit
the
stranger
if
you
care
to
look
around
the
you
will
be
most
welcome
she
announced
politely
he
accepted
the
invitation
gratefully
and
entered
with
her
at
the
first
glance
however
he
started
back
slightly
as
with
a
shock
of
surprise
why
how
strange
how
very
singular
he
murmured
these
candles
everything
everything
just
the
same
as
though
it
were
yesterday
did
you
often
come
here
inquired
joyce
you
must
be
very
well
acquainted
with
the
house
yes
i
came
often
i
was
almost
like
an
inmate
he
began
to
wander
slowly
about
the
room
examining
the
pictures
in
front
of
the
baby
twins
he
paused
a
long
time
then
you
must
have
known
young
fairfax
very
well
suggested
joyce
that
he
on
the
right
in
the
picture
the
stranger
eyed
her
curiously
why
yes
i
knew
him
well
but
you
little
lady
seem
quite
intimate
with
the
collingwood
family
history
tell
me
are
you
a
a
relative
this
confused
joyce
anew
oh
no
just
a
just
a
friend
she
explained
but
i
have
been
told
a
good
deal
about
them
an
unhappy
family
was
his
only
comment
and
he
continued
his
tour
around
the
room
in
front
of
the
old
square
open
piano
he
paused
again
and
fingered
the
silk
scarf
that
had
at
some
long
ago
date
been
thrown
carelessly
upon
it
then
he
ran
his
fingers
lightly
over
the
yellow
keys
the
tones
were
unbelievably
jangling
and
discordant
yet
joyce
thought
she
caught
the
notes
of
a
little
tune
and
in
another
moment
he
broke
into
the
air
singing
softly
the
opening
line
there
never
was
a
sweetheart
like
this
mother
fair
of
mine
he
had
sung
no
more
when
the
face
of
collingwood
appeared
in
the
doorway
her
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
her
features
almost
gray
in
color
who
who
you
she
demanded
in
a
voice
scarcely
louder
than
a
whisper
the
stranger
gazed
at
her
with
a
fixed
look
arthur
arthur
calthorpe
he
faltered
no
you
are
not
they
drew
toward
each
other
unconsciously
as
though
moving
in
a
dream
no
one
no
one
ever
knew
that
song
but
collingwood
came
closer
and
uttered
a
sudden
low
cry
son
the
two
girls
who
had
been
watching
this
scene
with
amazement
unutterable
saw
the
strange
pair
gaze
for
one
long
moment
into
each
other
eyes
then
with
a
beautiful
gesture
the
man
held
out
his
arms
and
the
woman
with
a
little
gasp
of
happiness
walked
into
them
chapter
xvi
joyce
explains
joyce
will
you
just
oblige
me
by
pinching
me
real
hard
i
perfectly
certain
i
not
awake
joyce
pinched
obligingly
and
with
vigor
thereby
eliciting
from
her
companion
a
muffled
squeak
the
two
girls
were
sitting
on
the
lower
step
of
the
staircase
in
the
dark
hallway
they
had
been
sitting
there
for
a
long
long
while
it
was
joyce
who
had
pulled
cynthia
away
from
staring
at
the
spectacle
of
that
marvelous
reunion
and
they
had
slipped
out
into
the
hall
unobserved
in
order
that
the
two
in
the
might
have
this
wonderful
moment
to
themselves
neither
of
them
had
yet
sufficiently
recovered
from
her
amazement
to
be
quite
coherent
i
ca
make
anything
out
of
it
began
cynthia
slowly
at
last
dead
evidently
he
is
replied
joyce
or
he
would
be
here
but
oh
it
true
then
i
hardly
dared
to
hope
it
would
be
so
i
glad
i
did
it
cynthia
turned
on
her
joyce
kenway
are
you
talking
about
it
sounds
as
though
you
were
going
crazy
oh
of
course
you
do
understand
retorted
joyce
and
it
your
own
fault
too
i
have
been
glad
enough
to
explain
and
talk
it
over
with
you
only
you
were
so
hateful
that
i
just
went
home
instead
and
thought
it
out
myself
well
i
may
be
stupid
remarked
cynthia
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
make
any
sense
out
of
what
you
saying
listen
then
said
joyce
and
i
explain
it
all
you
remember
last
night
how
i
sat
reading
the
newspaper
first
just
to
tease
you
and
afterward
i
really
got
interested
in
it
well
i
happened
to
be
glancing
over
the
news
about
people
who
had
just
landed
here
from
abroad
when
a
little
paragraph
caught
my
eye
i
ca
remember
the
exact
words
but
it
was
something
like
this
that
among
the
passengers
just
arrived
in
new
york
on
the
was
who
was
interested
in
western
and
australian
gold
mines
he
had
not
been
here
in
the
east
for
nearly
forty
years
and
it
said
how
astounded
he
was
at
the
remarkable
changes
that
had
taken
place
during
his
long
absence
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
he
was
staying
at
the
for
only
a
few
days
as
he
was
just
here
on
some
important
business
and
was
then
going
to
cross
the
continent
on
his
way
back
to
australia
well
you
better
believe
that
i
nearly
jumped
out
of
my
skin
at
the
name
fairfax
collingwood
it
an
unusual
one
and
it
did
seem
possible
that
more
than
one
person
could
have
it
though
of
course
it
might
be
a
distant
connection
of
the
same
family
and
then
too
fairfax
collingwood
was
dead
i
did
know
what
to
think
i
tried
to
get
your
attention
but
you
were
still
as
mad
as
you
could
be
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
go
home
and
puzzle
over
it
by
myself
and
i
took
the
paper
with
me
after
i
got
home
i
sat
and
thought
and
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
he
was
killed
in
the
war
after
all
that
there
been
some
mistake
i
read
that
such
things
did
happen
but
if
it
were
so
i
could
imagine
why
he
did
go
and
make
it
up
with
his
mother
afterward
it
seemed
very
strange
and
then
this
explanation
dawned
on
me
he
had
left
that
note
for
his
mother
and
perhaps
thought
that
if
she
really
intended
to
forgive
him
she
have
made
some
effort
to
get
word
to
him
in
the
year
that
elapsed
before
he
was
reported
killed
then
as
she
never
did
he
may
have
concluded
that
it
was
all
useless
and
hopeless
and
he
better
let
the
report
stand
and
he
disappear
and
never
come
back
you
see
that
article
said
he
had
been
east
here
for
forty
years
and
when
i
thought
this
out
an
idea
popped
into
my
head
if
what
imagined
was
true
it
did
seem
to
let
him
go
on
thinking
that
when
i
knew
that
his
mother
never
saw
that
letter
and
i
decided
i
let
him
know
it
so
i
sat
right
down
and
wrote
a
note
that
went
something
like
this
fairfax
collingwood
if
you
are
the
same
fairfax
collingwood
who
in
parted
from
your
mother
after
a
disagreement
leaving
a
note
for
her
which
you
hoped
she
would
read
i
want
to
tell
you
that
she
never
saw
that
note
joyce
kenway
i
signed
my
name
right
out
because
father
has
always
said
that
to
write
an
anonymous
letter
was
the
most
despicable
thing
any
one
could
do
and
if
he
ever
discovered
who
i
was
i
would
be
ashamed
to
tell
him
what
we
had
done
anyway
of
course
i
ran
the
chance
of
his
not
being
the
right
person
but
i
thought
if
that
were
so
he
simply
would
pay
any
attention
to
the
note
and
the
whole
thing
would
end
there
i
addressed
the
letter
to
his
hotel
and
decided
that
it
must
be
mailed
that
very
night
for
he
might
suddenly
leave
there
and
i
never
know
where
else
to
find
him
it
was
then
nearly
ten
and
i
did
want
father
or
mother
to
know
about
it
so
i
teased
anne
into
running
out
to
the
with
me
he
must
have
received
it
this
morning
cynthia
had
listened
to
this
long
explanation
in
astonished
silence
is
it
the
most
remarkable
thing
she
exclaimed
when
joyce
had
finished
that
each
of
us
should
write
i
to
the
mother
and
you
to
the
son
and
neither
of
us
even
guess
what
the
other
was
doing
and
that
they
should
meet
here
just
this
afternoon
but
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
things
i
ca
understand
at
all
why
for
instance
did
he
give
the
name
of
arthur
calthorpe
when
he
came
in
and
pretend
he
was
some
one
else
that
been
puzzling
me
too
replied
joyce
and
i
ca
think
of
any
reason
but
the
thing
that
confuses
me
most
of
all
added
cynthia
is
this
why
if
you
had
written
that
note
and
had
an
idea
that
he
was
alive
were
so
tremendously
astonished
when
he
and
his
mother
recognized
each
other
i
should
have
thought
you
guess
right
away
when
you
saw
him
at
the
door
who
he
was
that
just
the
queer
part
of
it
said
joyce
in
the
first
place
i
never
expected
him
to
come
out
here
at
all
at
least
not
right
away
i
never
put
the
name
of
this
town
in
the
letter
nor
mentioned
this
house
i
supposed
of
course
that
he
go
piling
right
down
to
south
carolina
to
find
his
mother
or
see
whether
she
was
alive
then
later
when
they
made
it
all
up
provided
she
was
alive
which
even
know
then
i
thought
they
might
come
back
here
and
open
the
house
that
was
one
reason
i
wanted
to
have
our
illumination
next
week
on
the
chance
of
their
arriving
so
you
see
i
was
quite
unprepared
to
see
him
rushing
out
here
at
once
and
when
he
gave
another
name
that
completely
deceived
me
and
then
there
one
thing
more
somehow
i
had
in
my
mind
a
picture
of
fairfax
collingwood
that
was
as
different
as
could
be
from
well
from
what
he
is
you
see
i
always
thought
of
him
as
the
whom
lucia
described
having
seen
i
pictured
him
as
slim
and
young
looking
with
golden
curly
hair
and
big
brown
eyes
his
eyes
are
the
same
but
well
i
somehow
never
counted
on
the
change
that
all
those
forty
years
would
make
you
ca
think
how
different
my
idea
of
him
was
and
naturally
that
helped
all
the
more
to
throw
me
off
the
track
but
why
began
cynthia
afresh
oh
do
let
try
to
puzzle
over
it
any
more
just
now
interrupted
joyce
my
head
is
simply
in
a
whirl
i
ca
even
straight
i
never
had
so
many
surprises
all
at
once
in
my
life
i
think
he
will
explain
everything
we
do
understand
let
just
wait
there
were
faint
sounds
from
the
but
they
were
indistinguishable
low
murmurings
and
sobs
the
two
reunited
ones
within
were
bridging
the
gulf
of
forty
years
and
so
the
girls
continued
to
wait
outside
in
the
silence
and
in
the
dark
chapter
xvii
in
which
all
mysteries
are
solved
at
last
the
two
on
the
staircase
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
door
and
a
pleasant
voice
called
out
where
are
you
both
little
ladies
will
you
not
come
and
join
us
i
think
we
must
have
some
things
to
be
explained
they
came
forward
a
little
timidly
and
their
latest
visitor
held
out
a
hand
to
each
you
wonderful
two
he
exclaimed
do
you
realize
that
had
it
not
been
for
you
this
would
never
have
happened
my
mother
and
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
beyond
all
expressing
come
and
join
us
now
and
we
will
solve
the
riddles
which
i
sure
are
puzzling
us
all
he
led
them
over
to
the
sofa
and
placed
them
beside
his
mother
never
was
a
change
more
remarkable
than
that
which
had
come
upon
collingwood
her
face
from
being
one
of
the
saddest
they
had
ever
seen
had
grown
fairly
radiant
she
looked
younger
too
ten
years
seemed
suddenly
to
have
dropped
from
her
shoulders
her
brown
eyes
flashed
with
something
of
their
former
fire
and
she
smiled
down
at
them
as
only
the
lovely
lady
of
the
portrait
had
ever
smiled
there
was
no
difficulty
now
in
identifying
her
with
that
picture
oh
please
began
joyce
breathlessly
wo
you
tell
us
collingwood
how
you
come
to
be
dead
and
why
you
gave
another
name
at
the
door
and
and
he
laughed
i
tell
you
all
that
he
interrupted
if
you
tell
who
kenway
is
why
am
said
joyce
in
surprise
did
you
guess
it
how
could
i
he
answered
i
never
supposed
it
was
a
who
sent
me
that
note
i
did
not
even
feel
sure
that
the
name
was
not
assumed
to
hide
an
identity
in
fact
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
but
i
come
to
all
that
in
its
proper
place
i
sure
you
are
all
anxious
to
hear
the
strange
story
i
have
to
tell
in
the
first
place
as
it
easy
to
guess
i
was
killed
at
the
battle
of
shiloh
at
all
but
so
very
seriously
wounded
that
i
came
to
be
so
reported
as
i
lay
on
the
field
with
scores
of
others
after
the
battle
a
poor
fellow
near
me
who
had
been
terribly
hurt
was
moaning
and
tossing
my
own
wound
did
not
hamper
me
so
much
at
the
time
so
i
crawled
over
to
him
and
tried
to
make
him
as
comfortable
as
possible
till
a
surgeon
should
arrive
presently
he
began
to
shiver
so
with
some
sort
of
a
chill
that
i
took
off
my
coat
and
wrapped
it
round
him
the
coat
had
some
of
my
personal
papers
in
it
but
i
did
not
think
of
that
at
the
time
when
the
surgeons
did
arrive
we
were
removed
to
different
army
hospitals
and
i
never
saw
the
man
again
but
he
probably
died
very
soon
after
and
evidently
finding
my
name
on
him
in
the
confusion
it
was
reported
that
was
dead
well
when
i
saw
the
notice
of
my
own
death
in
the
paper
my
first
impulse
was
to
deny
it
at
once
but
my
second
thought
was
to
let
it
pass
after
all
i
believed
that
i
had
broken
forever
with
my
home
in
the
year
that
had
elapsed
i
had
never
ceased
to
hope
that
the
note
i
left
would
soften
my
mother
feelings
toward
me
and
that
at
least
she
would
send
me
word
that
i
was
forgiven
but
the
word
had
never
come
and
hope
was
now
quite
dead
perhaps
it
would
be
kinder
to
her
to
allow
her
to
think
i
was
no
more
having
died
in
the
cause
i
thought
right
the
more
i
thought
it
over
the
more
i
became
convinced
that
this
was
the
wisest
course
therefore
i
let
the
report
stand
i
was
quite
unknown
where
i
was
and
i
decided
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
make
my
way
out
west
and
live
out
my
life
far
from
the
scenes
of
so
much
unhappiness
my
wound
disqualified
me
from
further
army
service
and
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
even
after
i
was
dismissed
from
the
hospital
nevertheless
i
worked
my
way
to
the
far
west
partly
on
foot
and
partly
in
the
slow
of
that
period
once
in
california
i
became
deeply
interested
in
the
gold
mines
where
i
was
certain
like
many
another
deluded
one
that
i
was
shortly
going
to
amass
an
enormous
fortune
but
after
several
years
of
fruitless
search
and
fruitless
toil
i
stood
as
poor
as
the
day
i
had
first
come
into
the
region
in
the
meantime
the
fascination
of
the
life
had
taken
hold
of
me
and
i
could
relinquish
it
for
no
other
i
had
always
from
a
small
child
been
passionately
fond
of
adventure
and
yearned
to
see
other
regions
and
test
my
fortune
in
new
and
untried
ways
i
could
have
done
so
no
more
acceptably
than
in
the
very
course
i
was
now
pursuing
at
the
end
of
those
hard
but
interesting
years
in
california
rumors
drifted
to
me
of
golden
possibilities
in
upper
canada
and
i
decided
to
try
my
luck
in
the
new
field
the
region
was
at
that
time
practically
a
trackless
wilderness
and
to
brave
it
at
all
was
considered
the
limit
of
folly
that
however
far
from
deterring
me
attracted
me
only
the
more
i
got
together
an
outfit
and
bade
a
long
farewell
to
even
the
rough
civilization
of
california
those
were
strange
years
marvelous
years
that
i
spent
in
the
mountain
fastnesses
of
upper
canada
for
month
on
month
i
would
see
no
human
being
save
the
indian
guide
who
accompanied
me
and
most
of
the
time
seemed
to
me
scarcely
human
and
all
the
while
the
search
for
gold
went
on
endlessly
endlessly
and
the
way
led
me
farther
and
farther
from
the
haunts
of
men
then
one
day
i
found
it
found
it
in
a
mass
near
the
surface
and
in
such
quantities
that
i
actually
had
little
else
to
do
but
shovel
it
out
wash
it
and
lay
the
precious
nuggets
aside
till
at
length
the
vein
was
exhausted
on
weighing
it
up
i
found
such
a
quantity
that
there
was
really
no
object
in
pursuing
the
search
any
farther
i
had
enough
i
was
wealthy
and
to
spare
and
the
longing
came
upon
me
to
return
to
my
own
kind
again
by
this
time
fifteen
years
had
passed
you
must
not
however
think
that
in
all
these
years
and
these
absorbing
interests
i
had
forgotten
my
mother
on
the
contrary
especially
when
i
was
in
the
wilderness
she
was
constantly
in
my
thoughts
before
i
left
california
for
canada
the
war
was
then
over
some
four
or
five
years
i
had
contemplated
writing
to
her
informing
her
of
the
mistake
about
my
death
and
begging
her
once
more
to
forgive
me
but
for
several
reasons
i
did
not
do
this
in
the
first
place
i
had
heard
of
the
exceeding
bitterness
of
the
south
increased
tenfold
by
the
period
of
reconstruction
through
which
it
was
then
passing
old
grudges
they
told
me
were
cherished
more
deeply
than
ever
and
members
of
the
same
family
often
regarded
each
other
with
hatred
of
what
use
for
me
then
i
thought
to
sue
for
a
reconciliation
at
such
a
time
beside
that
my
very
pride
was
another
barrier
i
had
not
been
successful
i
was
in
fact
practically
penniless
would
it
not
appear
as
though
i
were
anxious
for
a
reconciliation
because
i
did
not
wish
to
lose
the
property
which
would
one
day
have
been
mine
had
not
my
mother
disinherited
me
no
i
could
never
allow
even
the
hint
of
such
a
suspicion
i
would
wait
but
in
the
canadian
wilderness
i
began
to
see
matters
in
another
light
so
far
from
the
haunts
of
humanity
and
the
clash
of
human
interests
one
can
not
help
but
look
at
all
things
more
sanely
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
my
mother
far
from
cherishing
any
bitter
feeling
toward
me
now
that
she
thought
me
dead
might
be
suffering
agonies
of
grief
and
remorse
because
we
had
not
been
reconciled
before
the
end
if
there
were
even
a
possibility
of
this
i
must
relieve
it
so
i
sat
down
one
day
and
wrote
her
the
most
loving
penitent
letter
begging
anew
for
forgiveness
and
giving
her
the
history
of
my
adventures
and
my
whereabouts
this
letter
i
sent
off
by
my
guide
to
be
mailed
at
the
nearest
it
took
him
a
month
to
make
the
journey
there
and
back
i
waited
three
months
more
in
great
impatience
then
sent
him
back
to
the
same
post
to
see
if
there
might
be
a
reply
he
came
back
in
due
time
but
bringing
nothing
for
me
and
i
felt
that
my
appeal
had
been
in
vain
nevertheless
a
few
months
later
i
wrote
again
with
no
better
result
my
guide
returned
and
during
the
last
year
i
was
there
i
made
the
third
and
final
trial
and
when
again
no
answer
came
i
felt
that
it
was
beyond
all
hope
to
expect
forgiveness
since
she
could
ignore
three
such
urgent
appeals
i
have
just
learned
from
my
mother
that
these
letters
were
never
received
by
her
which
is
a
great
surprise
to
me
but
i
think
i
know
the
explanation
my
guide
was
not
honest
indeed
few
of
them
are
but
strangely
enough
i
never
discovered
any
dishonesty
in
him
while
he
was
with
me
at
that
time
the
postage
on
letters
from
that
region
was
very
high
sometimes
as
much
as
fifty
or
sixty
cents
or
even
a
dollar
this
of
course
i
always
gave
to
the
guide
to
use
in
sending
the
letter
when
he
got
to
the
now
though
the
sum
seems
small
to
us
it
was
large
to
him
and
though
i
never
suspected
it
at
the
time
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
pocketed
the
money
and
simply
destroyed
the
letters
so
that
explains
why
my
mother
never
received
any
of
them
well
i
returned
to
california
a
rich
man
able
to
indulge
myself
in
any
form
of
amusement
or
adventure
that
pleased
me
i
found
that
i
still
felt
the
lure
of
foreign
countries
and
the
less
explored
or
inhabited
the
better
i
shipped
for
a
voyage
to
japan
and
china
and
spent
several
more
years
trying
to
penetrate
the
forbidden
fastnesses
of
tibet
from
there
i
worked
down
through
india
found
my
way
to
the
south
sea
islands
and
landed
at
length
in
australia
with
the
intention
of
penetrating
farther
into
that
continent
than
any
white
man
had
yet
set
foot
i
think
by
this
time
i
had
pretty
well
lost
all
desire
ever
to
return
to
america
especially
to
new
york
but
at
intervals
i
still
felt
an
inexpressible
longing
to
see
or
hear
from
my
mother
ten
or
twelve
added
years
had
slipped
by
and
it
did
not
seem
human
that
she
should
continue
to
feel
bitterly
toward
me
i
had
almost
decided
to
write
to
her
once
more
when
in
sydney
new
south
wales
where
i
happened
to
be
looking
over
the
files
of
an
old
new
york
paper
in
the
public
library
i
stumbled
on
the
of
a
fairfax
collingwood
of
chesterton
south
carolina
the
paper
was
dated
seven
years
before
the
knowledge
was
like
a
in
my
heart
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
truth
i
knew
of
no
other
of
that
name
and
the
town
was
the
very
one
in
which
she
lived
my
mother
now
tells
me
that
she
knew
of
this
mistake
an
error
of
the
new
york
paper
in
copying
the
item
from
a
southern
journal
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
a
very
distant
cousin
of
hers
who
had
died
a
fanshawe
collingwood
who
also
lived
in
the
town
she
was
my
mother
only
living
relative
and
the
paper
mentioned
this
circumstance
but
when
the
new
york
paper
copied
it
they
left
out
all
about
the
surviving
cousin
and
merely
mentioned
the
name
of
the
deceased
as
fairfax
collingwood
my
mother
had
this
rectified
in
a
later
publication
of
the
paper
but
that
of
course
i
never
saw
well
i
went
into
the
heart
of
australia
under
the
impression
that
i
was
now
really
motherless
and
under
that
impression
i
have
lived
ever
since
i
can
not
now
detail
to
you
all
my
wanderings
and
adventures
i
will
only
say
that
i
became
deeply
interested
in
the
australian
gold
mines
bought
up
one
finally
and
have
superintended
its
running
ever
since
lately
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
make
a
business
trip
to
new
york
in
connection
with
this
mine
and
i
decided
to
come
by
way
of
europe
since
i
had
never
seen
that
portion
of
the
globe
my
business
would
not
keep
me
in
new
york
more
than
a
week
and
i
intended
to
travel
at
once
back
to
australia
across
the
continent
in
order
to
see
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
since
i
left
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
of
visiting
this
old
home
why
indeed
should
i
my
mother
as
i
supposed
was
dead
nothing
else
mattered
i
had
no
interest
in
the
property
for
aught
i
knew
it
might
have
changed
hands
twenty
times
since
we
lived
there
it
might
not
even
be
in
existence
at
any
rate
i
had
no
wish
to
revive
the
bitterness
of
that
memory
then
came
the
strange
note
this
morning
which
i
believe
you
miss
joyce
are
responsible
for
to
say
that
i
was
completely
bewildered
by
it
would
be
putting
it
mildly
it
made
a
statement
that
was
new
to
me
indeed
and
might
account
for
many
things
but
what
was
i
to
do
about
it
which
way
should
i
turn
no
use
to
hurry
down
to
south
carolina
my
mother
being
dead
of
whom
should
i
make
inquiries
the
firm
of
new
york
lawyers
that
i
remembered
her
as
formerly
retaining
i
dreaded
to
consult
lest
they
think
i
had
come
to
make
a
claim
on
the
property
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
no
clue
and
then
i
happened
to
look
at
the
envelope
and
saw
that
it
was
postmarked
rockridge
a
region
which
i
speedily
ascertained
was
right
in
the
vicinity
of
my
old
home
that
decided
me
to
come
out
here
at
once
this
afternoon
hunt
up
the
spot
and
try
to
discover
in
this
way
whether
there
was
any
use
of
pursuing
investigations
further
in
this
direction
as
i
have
said
i
naturally
supposed
that
the
property
had
changed
hands
many
times
before
this
and
that
all
its
old
belongings
had
long
since
been
sent
to
my
mother
or
sold
by
her
orders
when
i
arrived
in
this
street
and
saw
the
old
house
still
standing
forlorn
unkempt
apparently
deserted
and
quite
unchanged
since
i
knew
it
i
was
still
more
astonished
but
when
i
noticed
the
little
door
in
the
boarding
standing
open
i
resolved
to
begin
my
investigations
right
there
and
i
boldly
went
up
and
knocked
then
miss
joyce
came
out
and
announced
that
a
member
of
the
collingwood
family
was
here
on
business
that
too
seemed
incredible
as
i
remembered
no
surviving
member
of
the
family
discretion
however
seemed
to
me
the
better
part
of
valor
and
i
decided
to
give
the
name
that
i
had
borne
during
my
first
years
in
california
till
i
could
ascertain
more
definitely
just
what
the
situation
was
so
i
came
in
as
arthur
calthorpe
and
the
mystery
deepened
tenfold
when
i
saw
this
old
room
all
lit
up
precisely
as
i
had
remembered
it
so
many
years
ago
it
so
carried
me
back
into
my
youth
that
for
a
few
moments
i
quite
lost
track
of
the
present
and
when
i
came
to
the
old
piano
the
impulse
seized
me
to
play
a
few
bars
and
hum
the
lines
of
a
little
song
i
had
once
composed
for
my
mother
i
had
at
that
time
rather
a
gift
for
music
and
this
song
was
a
sort
of
secret
of
ours
i
never
sang
or
played
it
for
any
one
else
and
she
remembered
it
well
you
know
the
rest
and
he
stopped
abruptly
they
all
drew
long
breaths
of
relaxed
tension
there
something
that
has
puzzled
me
all
along
began
joyce
at
last
i
wonder
if
collingwood
would
object
to
my
asking
about
it
no
indeed
dear
child
replied
that
lady
have
no
hesitation
in
asking
what
you
wish
it
this
then
i
have
often
and
often
wondered
why
you
never
came
back
to
this
beautiful
old
home
or
at
least
sent
for
the
books
and
pictures
and
lovely
things
that
were
going
to
ruin
here
did
you
never
think
of
it
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
ask
answered
collingwood
for
it
must
have
seemed
very
strange
to
an
outsider
of
course
for
the
first
few
years
my
anger
had
been
so
great
and
my
grief
was
still
so
terrible
that
i
felt
i
could
never
never
look
upon
the
place
or
anything
in
it
again
then
as
you
have
heard
i
willed
the
house
itself
and
the
land
to
the
southern
society
as
i
had
no
one
to
whom
i
wished
to
leave
it
and
my
means
were
sufficient
so
that
i
did
not
need
to
sell
it
as
the
years
passed
on
however
and
my
feelings
altered
i
did
begin
to
think
it
a
pity
that
the
place
should
run
to
neglect
and
ruin
so
strong
did
this
conviction
become
that
i
decided
to
come
north
myself
and
personally
superintend
putting
the
house
in
order
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
this
task
to
outsiders
i
even
thought
that
if
i
found
i
could
endure
the
memories
i
would
live
in
it
a
while
for
the
sake
of
the
old
happy
years
with
my
little
boy
i
even
had
my
trunks
packed
and
my
ticket
bought
when
suddenly
i
came
down
with
typhoid
fever
so
severe
an
attack
that
it
was
thought
i
could
not
live
that
ended
all
thoughts
of
my
coming
north
for
a
long
while
as
i
was
miserably
weak
and
helpless
for
months
after
and
in
fact
have
never
quite
recovered
my
strength
the
years
drifted
on
and
with
them
came
old
age
and
the
reluctance
to
make
the
long
journey
and
endure
the
strain
of
it
all
had
it
not
been
for
miss
cynthia
letter
i
should
never
have
come
but
to
change
the
subject
a
trifle
my
son
is
very
anxious
to
know
how
you
two
young
things
have
come
to
be
concerned
in
all
this
and
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
tell
him
fully
will
you
not
give
him
an
account
of
it
now
it
is
very
wonderful
and
so
they
began
first
joyce
and
then
cynthia
interrupting
and
supplementing
each
other
they
were
still
rather
anxious
on
the
subject
of
meddling
and
trespassing
but
they
did
not
try
to
excuse
themselves
recounting
the
adventures
simply
and
hiding
nothing
the
older
people
listened
intently
sometimes
amused
sometimes
touched
often
more
deeply
moved
than
they
cared
to
show
we
began
it
at
first
just
for
fun
we
pretended
to
be
detectives
but
as
it
went
on
we
got
more
and
more
deeply
interested
till
at
last
this
this
all
seemed
more
important
than
our
own
lives
ended
joyce
only
i
know
we
did
wrong
in
the
beginning
ever
to
come
in
here
at
all
we
are
trespassers
and
meddlers
and
i
hope
you
can
forgive
us
the
dearest
little
meddlers
in
the
world
cried
collingwood
can
any
forgiveness
be
necessary
and
she
cuddled
them
both
in
her
arms
there
just
one
thing
like
to
ask
if
you
do
mind
said
cynthia
coming
suddenly
out
of
a
brown
study
it
the
one
thing
we
never
could
account
for
why
was
that
room
locked
and
what
has
become
of
the
key
collingwood
flushed
i
locked
the
door
and
threw
the
key
down
the
well
that
night
she
answered
slowly
i
do
suppose
you
can
quite
understand
if
you
are
not
afflicted
with
a
passionate
temper
as
i
was
when
my
son
when
fairfax
here
had
gone
and
i
was
shutting
up
the
house
and
came
to
his
room
i
wanted
to
go
in
oh
you
can
not
know
how
i
wanted
to
go
in
but
i
knew
that
if
i
once
entered
and
stood
among
his
dear
belongings
i
should
relent
i
should
rush
away
to
find
him
and
beg
him
to
come
back
to
me
and
i
i
did
not
to
relent
i
stood
there
five
minutes
debating
it
then
i
suddenly
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
and
before
giving
myself
time
for
a
second
thought
i
rushed
out
of
doors
and
threw
the
key
into
the
old
well
where
i
could
never
get
it
again
children
i
am
an
old
woman
i
shall
be
next
birthday
will
you
heed
a
lesson
i
have
learned
and
paid
for
with
the
bitterest
years
of
my
life
if
you
are
blessed
with
a
calm
even
forgiving
nature
thank
god
for
it
always
but
if
you
are
as
i
was
pray
daily
for
help
to
curb
that
nature
before
you
have
allowed
it
to
work
some
desperate
evil
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
there
there
little
mother
of
mine
murmured
her
son
let
us
forget
all
that
now
what
does
anything
matter
so
long
as
we
are
together
again
for
always
he
leaned
over
pulled
her
hands
from
her
face
and
kissed
her
tenderly
the
moment
was
an
awkward
one
and
cynthia
wished
madly
that
she
had
not
been
prompted
to
ask
that
unfortunate
question
suddenly
however
the
tension
was
broken
by
collingwood
exclaiming
mercy
me
see
that
enormous
walking
in
wherever
did
it
come
from
they
all
turned
toward
the
door
oh
that
goliath
said
joyce
calmly
he
feels
very
much
at
home
here
for
he
has
come
in
with
us
often
he
led
the
way
that
first
day
if
you
remember
and
he
been
a
help
he
a
better
detective
than
any
of
us
blessings
on
goliath
then
say
i
laughed
fairfax
collingwood
and
approaching
the
huge
feline
with
coaxing
words
he
gathered
its
unresisting
form
in
his
arms
and
deposited
the
warm
furry
purring
beast
in
his
mother
lap
and
while
they
were
all
laughing
over
and
petting
goliath
a
queer
thing
happened
the
candles
which
had
been
burning
now
for
several
hours
had
unnoticed
by
all
been
gradually
guttering
and
spluttering
out
at
length
only
four
or
five
flames
remained
feebly
wavering
in
their
pools
of
melted
wax
the
occupants
of
the
room
had
been
too
absorbed
with
their
own
affairs
to
notice
the
gradual
dimming
of
the
illumination
but
now
joyce
suddenly
looked
up
and
perceived
what
had
happened
why
look
at
the
candles
she
cried
there
are
only
about
three
left
and
they
wo
last
more
than
a
minute
or
two
even
as
she
spoke
two
of
them
flickered
out
the
remaining
one
struggled
for
another
and
flared
up
in
one
last
desperate
effort
the
next
instant
the
room
was
in
total
darkness
so
unexpected
was
the
change
that
they
all
sat
very
still
the
sudden
pall
of
darkness
in
this
strange
house
of
mystery
was
just
a
tiny
bit
awesome
well
this
a
predicament
exclaimed
fairfax
collingwood
who
was
first
to
recover
from
the
surprise
fortunately
i
have
a
box
of
matches
illustration
then
with
one
accord
they
began
to
steer
their
way
around
the
furniture
oh
do
worry
added
the
practical
cynthia
there
an
extra
candle
that
i
left
on
the
mantel
it
will
do
nicely
to
light
us
out
groping
to
the
with
the
aid
of
his
matches
collingwood
found
the
candle
and
lit
it
then
with
one
accord
they
all
rose
and
began
to
steer
their
way
around
the
furniture
toward
the
hall
goliath
following
in
the
hall
collingwood
looked
at
his
watch
exclaiming
it
is
who
would
believe
it
the
two
girls
gave
a
simultaneous
gasp
of
dismay
dinner
it
was
ready
half
an
hour
ago
what
they
think
cried
joyce
never
mind
they
think
just
for
responded
collingwood
gaily
you
can
tell
them
when
you
explaining
all
this
that
what
you
done
for
us
two
people
is
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
express
they
forgive
you
she
bent
down
and
kissed
them
both
with
a
caress
that
thrilled
them
to
their
then
they
all
passed
out
through
the
great
front
door
to
the
wide
old
veranda
collingwood
taking
the
key
from
his
mother
locked
the
little
door
in
the
boarding
after
them
and
in
the
warm
waning
may
afternoon
they
filed
down
the
steps
at
the
gate
collingwood
turned
to
the
girls
i
am
taking
my
mother
back
to
new
york
for
a
few
days
she
must
rest
and
we
have
much
to
talk
over
i
scarcely
need
tell
you
that
i
am
returning
to
australia
we
shall
come
back
here
very
soon
open
up
this
old
home
put
it
in
order
and
probably
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
between
here
and
the
south
dear
girls
i
hardly
need
say
to
you
that
in
all
the
world
we
shall
consider
that
we
have
no
closer
or
more
devoted
friends
than
yourselves
this
house
will
always
be
open
to
you
you
must
look
upon
it
as
a
second
home
you
have
given
back
to
us
the
most
priceless
blessing
the
one
thing
we
neither
hoped
nor
expected
to
enjoy
again
in
this
world
he
could
not
go
on
he
was
very
much
moved
and
as
for
the
two
girls
they
were
utterly
speechless
under
the
pressure
of
feeling
they
remained
standing
at
the
gate
watching
the
two
go
down
the
street
in
the
sunset
and
waved
to
them
wildly
as
they
turned
to
look
back
just
before
rounding
the
corner
and
at
last
the
intervening
trees
shut
them
from
sight
when
they
were
gone
cynthia
and
joyce
turned
and
looked
long
and
incredulously
into
each
other
eyes
they
have
made
on
this
occasion
a
number
of
and
appropriate
remarks
the
tenor
of
which
would
be
easy
to
imagine
certainly
the
time
for
it
was
ripe
and
beyond
a
doubt
they
them
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
indulged
in
nothing
of
the
sort
instead
joyce
suddenly
broke
into
a
laugh
we
never
have
to
go
in
there
by
the
cellar
window
again
she
remarked
sure
enough
agreed
cynthia
what
a
relief
that
be
and
so
ended
the
adventure
of
the
house
