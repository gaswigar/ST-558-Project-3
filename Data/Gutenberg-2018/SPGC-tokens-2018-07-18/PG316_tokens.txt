the
golden
road
by
montgomery
life
was
a
comrade
with
purple
flowers
dripping
from
her
the
author
to
the
memory
of
aunt
mary
lawson
who
told
me
many
of
the
tales
repeated
by
the
story
girl
foreword
once
upon
a
time
we
all
walked
on
the
golden
road
it
was
a
fair
highway
through
the
land
of
lost
delight
shadow
and
sunshine
were
blessedly
mingled
and
every
turn
and
dip
revealed
a
fresh
charm
and
a
new
loveliness
to
eager
hearts
and
unspoiled
eyes
on
that
road
we
heard
the
song
of
morning
stars
we
drank
in
fragrances
aerial
and
sweet
as
a
may
mist
we
were
rich
in
gossamer
fancies
and
iris
hopes
our
hearts
sought
and
found
the
boon
of
dreams
the
years
waited
beyond
and
they
were
very
fair
life
was
a
comrade
with
purple
flowers
dripping
from
her
fingers
we
may
long
have
left
the
golden
road
behind
but
its
memories
are
the
dearest
of
our
eternal
possessions
and
those
who
cherish
them
as
such
may
haply
find
a
pleasure
in
the
pages
of
this
book
whose
people
are
pilgrims
on
the
golden
road
of
youth
the
golden
road
chapter
i
a
new
departure
i
ve
thought
of
something
amusing
for
the
winter
i
said
as
we
drew
into
a
around
the
glorious
in
uncle
alec
s
kitchen
it
had
been
a
day
of
wild
november
wind
closing
down
into
a
wet
eerie
twilight
outside
the
wind
was
shrilling
at
the
windows
and
around
the
eaves
and
the
rain
was
playing
on
the
roof
the
old
willow
at
the
gate
was
writhing
in
the
storm
and
the
orchard
was
a
place
of
weird
music
born
of
all
the
tears
and
fears
that
haunt
the
halls
of
night
but
little
we
cared
for
the
gloom
and
the
loneliness
of
the
outside
world
we
kept
them
at
bay
with
the
light
of
the
fire
and
the
laughter
of
our
young
lips
we
had
been
having
a
splendid
game
of
s
buff
that
is
it
had
been
splendid
at
first
but
later
the
fun
went
out
of
it
because
we
found
that
peter
was
of
malice
prepense
allowing
himself
to
be
caught
too
easily
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
catching
felicity
which
he
never
failed
to
do
no
matter
how
tightly
his
eyes
were
bound
what
remarkable
goose
said
that
love
is
blind
love
can
see
through
five
folds
of
muffler
with
ease
i
m
getting
tired
said
cecily
whose
breath
was
coming
rather
quickly
and
whose
pale
cheeks
had
bloomed
into
scarlet
let
s
sit
down
and
get
the
story
girl
to
tell
us
a
but
as
we
dropped
into
our
places
the
story
girl
shot
a
significant
glance
at
me
which
intimated
that
this
was
the
psychological
moment
for
introducing
the
scheme
she
and
i
had
been
secretly
developing
for
some
days
it
was
really
the
story
girl
s
idea
and
none
of
mine
but
she
had
insisted
that
i
should
make
the
suggestion
as
coming
wholly
from
myself
if
you
don
t
felicity
won
t
agree
to
it
you
know
yourself
bev
how
contrary
she
s
been
lately
over
anything
i
mention
and
if
she
goes
against
it
peter
will
too
the
ninny
and
it
wouldn
t
be
any
fun
if
we
weren
t
all
in
what
is
it
asked
felicity
drawing
her
chair
slightly
away
from
peter
s
it
is
this
let
us
get
up
a
newspaper
of
our
own
write
it
all
ourselves
and
have
all
we
do
in
it
don
t
you
think
we
can
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
it
everyone
looked
rather
blank
and
amazed
except
the
story
girl
she
knew
what
she
had
to
do
and
she
did
it
what
a
silly
idea
she
exclaimed
with
a
contemptuous
toss
of
her
long
brown
curls
just
as
if
we
could
get
up
a
newspaper
felicity
fired
up
exactly
as
we
had
hoped
i
think
it
s
a
splendid
idea
she
said
enthusiastically
i
d
like
to
know
why
we
couldn
t
get
up
as
good
a
newspaper
as
they
have
in
town
uncle
roger
says
the
daily
enterprise
has
gone
to
the
dogs
all
the
news
it
prints
is
that
some
old
woman
has
put
a
shawl
on
her
head
and
gone
across
the
road
to
have
tea
with
another
old
woman
i
guess
we
could
do
better
than
that
you
needn
t
think
sara
stanley
that
nobody
but
you
can
do
i
think
it
would
be
great
fun
said
peter
decidedly
my
aunt
jane
helped
edit
a
paper
when
she
was
at
queen
s
academy
and
she
said
it
was
very
amusing
and
helped
her
a
great
the
story
girl
could
hide
her
delight
only
by
dropping
her
eyes
and
frowning
bev
wants
to
be
editor
she
said
and
i
don
t
see
how
he
can
with
no
experience
anyhow
it
would
be
a
lot
of
some
people
are
so
afraid
of
a
little
bother
retorted
felicity
i
think
it
would
be
nice
said
cecily
timidly
and
none
of
us
have
any
experience
of
being
editors
any
more
than
bev
so
that
wouldn
t
will
it
be
printed
asked
dan
oh
no
i
said
we
can
t
have
it
printed
we
ll
just
have
to
write
it
out
we
can
buy
foolscap
from
the
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
much
of
a
newspaper
if
it
isn
t
printed
said
dan
scornfully
it
doesn
t
matter
very
much
what
you
think
said
felicity
thank
you
retorted
dan
of
course
said
the
story
girl
hastily
not
wishing
to
have
dan
turned
against
our
project
if
all
the
rest
of
you
want
it
i
ll
go
in
for
it
too
i
daresay
it
would
be
real
good
fun
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
and
we
ll
keep
the
copies
and
when
we
become
famous
they
ll
be
quite
i
wonder
if
any
of
us
ever
will
be
famous
said
felix
the
story
girl
will
be
i
said
i
don
t
see
how
she
can
be
said
felicity
skeptically
why
she
s
just
one
of
well
it
s
decided
then
that
we
re
to
have
a
newspaper
i
resumed
briskly
the
next
thing
is
to
choose
a
name
for
it
that
s
a
very
important
how
often
are
you
going
to
publish
it
asked
felix
once
a
i
thought
newspapers
came
out
every
day
or
every
week
at
least
said
dan
we
couldn
t
have
one
every
week
i
explained
it
would
be
too
much
well
that
s
an
argument
admitted
dan
the
less
work
you
can
get
along
with
the
better
in
my
opinion
no
felicity
you
needn
t
say
it
i
know
exactly
what
you
want
to
say
so
save
your
breath
to
cool
your
porridge
i
agree
with
you
that
i
never
work
if
i
can
find
anything
else
to
remember
it
is
harder
still
to
have
no
work
to
do
quoted
cecily
reprovingly
i
don
t
believe
that
rejoined
dan
i
m
like
the
irishman
who
said
he
wished
the
man
who
begun
work
had
stayed
and
finished
well
is
it
decided
that
bev
is
to
be
editor
asked
felix
of
course
it
is
felicity
answered
for
everybody
then
said
felix
i
move
that
the
name
be
the
king
monthly
that
sounds
fine
said
peter
hitching
his
chair
a
little
nearer
felicity
s
but
said
cecily
timidly
that
will
leave
out
peter
and
the
story
girl
and
sara
ray
just
as
if
they
didn
t
have
a
share
in
it
i
don
t
think
that
would
be
you
name
it
then
cecily
i
suggested
oh
cecily
threw
a
deprecating
glance
at
the
story
girl
and
felicity
then
meeting
the
contempt
in
the
latter
s
gaze
she
raised
her
head
with
unusual
spirit
i
think
it
would
be
nice
just
to
call
it
our
magazine
she
said
then
we
d
all
feel
as
if
we
had
a
share
in
our
magazine
it
will
be
then
i
said
and
as
for
having
a
share
in
it
you
bet
we
ll
all
have
a
share
in
it
if
i
m
to
be
editor
you
ll
all
have
to
be
and
have
charge
of
a
oh
i
couldn
t
protested
cecily
you
must
i
said
inexorably
england
expects
everyone
to
do
his
that
s
our
motto
only
we
ll
put
prince
edward
island
in
place
of
england
there
must
be
no
shirking
now
what
departments
will
we
have
we
must
make
it
as
much
like
a
real
newspaper
as
we
well
we
ought
to
have
an
etiquette
department
then
said
felicity
the
family
guide
has
of
course
we
ll
have
one
i
said
and
dan
will
edit
dan
exclaimed
felicity
who
had
fondly
expected
to
be
asked
to
edit
it
herself
i
can
run
an
etiquette
column
as
well
as
that
idiot
in
the
family
guide
anyhow
said
dan
defiantly
but
you
can
t
have
an
etiquette
department
unless
questions
are
asked
what
am
i
to
do
if
nobody
asks
any
you
must
make
some
up
said
the
story
girl
uncle
roger
says
that
is
what
the
family
guide
man
does
he
says
it
is
impossible
that
there
can
be
as
many
hopeless
fools
in
the
world
as
that
column
would
stand
for
we
want
you
to
edit
the
household
department
felicity
i
said
seeing
a
cloud
lowering
on
that
fair
lady
s
brow
nobody
can
do
that
as
well
as
you
felix
will
edit
the
jokes
and
the
information
bureau
and
cecily
must
be
fashion
editor
yes
you
must
sis
it
s
easy
as
wink
and
the
story
girl
will
attend
to
the
personals
they
re
very
important
anyone
can
contribute
a
personal
but
the
story
girl
is
to
see
there
are
some
in
every
issue
even
if
she
has
to
make
them
up
like
dan
with
the
bev
will
run
the
scrap
book
department
besides
the
editorials
said
the
story
girl
seeing
that
i
was
too
modest
to
say
it
myself
aren
t
you
going
to
have
a
story
page
asked
peter
we
will
if
you
ll
be
fiction
and
poetry
editor
i
said
peter
in
his
secret
soul
was
dismayed
but
he
would
not
blanch
before
felicity
all
right
he
said
recklessly
we
can
put
anything
we
like
in
the
scrap
book
department
i
explained
but
all
the
other
contributions
must
be
original
and
all
must
have
the
name
of
the
writer
signed
to
them
except
the
personals
we
must
all
do
our
best
our
magazine
is
to
be
a
feast
of
reason
and
flow
of
i
felt
that
i
had
worked
in
two
quotations
with
striking
effect
the
others
with
the
exception
of
the
story
girl
looked
suitably
impressed
but
said
cecily
reproachfully
haven
t
you
anything
for
sara
ray
to
do
she
ll
feel
awful
bad
if
she
is
left
i
had
forgotten
sara
ray
nobody
except
cecily
ever
did
remember
sara
ray
unless
she
was
on
the
spot
but
we
decided
to
put
her
in
as
advertising
manager
that
sounded
well
and
really
meant
very
little
well
we
ll
go
ahead
then
i
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
project
had
been
so
easily
launched
we
ll
get
the
first
issue
out
about
the
first
of
january
and
whatever
else
we
do
we
mustn
t
let
uncle
roger
get
hold
of
it
he
d
make
such
fearful
fun
of
i
hope
we
can
make
a
success
of
it
said
peter
moodily
he
had
been
moody
ever
since
he
was
entrapped
into
being
fiction
editor
it
will
be
a
success
if
we
are
determined
to
succeed
i
said
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
always
a
that
s
just
what
ursula
townley
said
when
her
father
locked
her
in
her
room
the
night
she
was
going
to
run
away
with
kenneth
macnair
said
the
story
girl
we
pricked
up
our
ears
scenting
a
story
who
were
ursula
townley
and
kenneth
macnair
i
asked
kenneth
macnair
was
a
first
cousin
of
the
awkward
man
s
grandfather
and
ursula
townley
was
the
belle
of
the
island
in
her
day
who
do
you
suppose
told
me
the
story
no
read
it
to
me
out
of
his
brown
book
never
the
awkward
man
himself
i
exclaimed
incredulously
yes
he
did
said
the
story
girl
triumphantly
i
met
him
one
day
last
week
back
in
the
maple
woods
when
i
was
looking
for
ferns
he
was
sitting
by
the
spring
writing
in
his
brown
book
he
hid
it
when
he
saw
me
and
looked
real
silly
but
after
i
had
talked
to
him
awhile
i
just
asked
him
about
it
and
told
him
that
the
gossips
said
he
wrote
poetry
in
it
and
if
he
did
would
he
tell
me
because
i
was
dying
to
know
he
said
he
wrote
a
little
of
everything
in
it
and
then
i
begged
him
to
read
me
something
out
of
it
and
he
read
me
the
story
of
ursula
and
i
don
t
see
how
you
ever
had
the
face
said
felicity
and
even
cecily
looked
as
if
she
thought
the
story
girl
had
gone
rather
far
never
mind
that
cried
felix
but
tell
us
the
story
that
s
the
main
i
ll
tell
it
just
as
the
awkward
man
read
it
as
far
as
i
can
said
the
story
girl
but
i
can
t
put
all
his
nice
poetical
touches
in
because
i
can
t
remember
them
all
though
he
read
it
over
twice
for
chapter
ii
a
will
a
way
and
a
woman
one
day
over
a
hundred
years
ago
ursula
townley
was
waiting
for
kenneth
macnair
in
a
great
beechwood
where
brown
nuts
were
falling
and
an
october
wind
was
making
the
leaves
dance
on
the
ground
like
what
are
demanded
peter
forgetting
the
story
girl
s
dislike
of
interruptions
hush
whispered
cecily
that
is
only
one
of
the
awkward
man
s
poetical
touches
i
there
were
cultivated
fields
between
the
grove
and
the
dark
blue
gulf
but
far
behind
and
on
each
side
were
woods
for
prince
edward
island
a
hundred
years
ago
was
not
what
it
is
today
the
settlements
were
few
and
scattered
and
the
population
so
scanty
that
old
hugh
townley
boasted
that
he
knew
every
man
woman
and
child
in
it
old
hugh
was
quite
a
noted
man
in
his
day
he
was
noted
for
several
things
he
was
rich
he
was
hospitable
he
was
proud
he
was
masterful
and
he
had
for
daughter
the
handsomest
young
woman
in
prince
edward
island
of
course
the
young
men
were
not
blind
to
her
good
looks
and
she
had
so
many
lovers
that
all
the
other
girls
hated
her
you
bet
said
dan
aside
but
the
only
one
who
found
favour
in
her
eyes
was
the
very
last
man
she
should
have
pitched
her
fancy
on
at
least
if
old
hugh
were
the
judge
kenneth
macnair
was
a
young
of
the
next
settlement
and
it
was
to
meet
him
that
ursula
stole
to
the
beechwood
on
that
autumn
day
of
crisp
wind
and
ripe
sunshine
old
hugh
had
forbidden
his
house
to
the
young
man
making
such
a
scene
of
fury
about
it
that
even
ursula
s
high
spirit
quailed
old
hugh
had
really
nothing
against
kenneth
himself
but
years
before
either
kenneth
or
ursula
was
born
kenneth
s
father
had
beaten
hugh
townley
in
a
hotly
contested
election
political
feeling
ran
high
in
those
days
and
old
hugh
had
never
forgiven
the
macnair
his
victory
the
feud
between
the
families
dated
from
that
tempest
in
the
provincial
teapot
and
the
surplus
of
votes
on
the
wrong
side
was
the
reason
why
thirty
years
after
ursula
had
to
meet
her
lover
by
stealth
if
she
met
him
at
was
the
macnair
a
conservative
or
a
grit
asked
felicity
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
what
he
was
said
the
story
girl
impatiently
even
a
tory
would
be
romantic
a
hundred
years
ago
well
ursula
couldn
t
see
kenneth
very
often
for
kenneth
lived
fifteen
miles
away
and
was
often
absent
from
home
in
his
vessel
on
this
particular
day
it
was
nearly
three
months
since
they
had
met
the
sunday
before
young
sandy
macnair
had
been
in
carlyle
church
he
had
risen
at
dawn
that
morning
walked
for
eight
miles
along
the
shore
carrying
his
shoes
hired
a
harbour
fisherman
to
row
him
over
the
channel
and
then
walked
eight
miles
more
to
the
church
at
carlyle
less
it
is
to
be
feared
from
a
zeal
for
holy
things
than
that
he
might
do
an
errand
for
his
adored
brother
kenneth
he
carried
a
letter
which
he
contrived
to
pass
into
ursula
s
hand
in
the
crowd
as
the
people
came
out
this
letter
asked
ursula
to
meet
kenneth
in
the
beechwood
the
next
afternoon
and
so
she
stole
away
there
when
suspicious
father
and
watchful
stepmother
thought
she
was
spinning
in
the
granary
it
was
very
wrong
of
her
to
deceive
her
parents
said
felicity
primly
the
story
girl
couldn
t
deny
this
so
she
evaded
the
ethical
side
of
the
question
skilfully
i
am
not
telling
you
what
ursula
townley
ought
to
have
done
she
said
loftily
i
am
only
telling
you
what
she
did
do
if
you
don
t
want
to
hear
it
you
needn
t
listen
of
course
there
wouldn
t
be
many
stories
to
tell
if
nobody
ever
did
anything
she
shouldn
t
do
well
when
kenneth
came
the
meeting
was
just
what
might
have
been
expected
between
two
lovers
who
had
taken
their
last
kiss
three
months
before
so
it
was
a
good
before
ursula
said
oh
kenneth
i
can
not
stay
long
i
shall
be
missed
you
said
in
your
letter
that
you
had
something
important
to
talk
of
what
is
it
my
news
is
this
ursula
next
saturday
morning
my
vessel
the
fair
lady
with
her
captain
on
board
sails
at
dawn
from
charlottetown
harbour
bound
for
buenos
ayres
at
this
season
this
means
a
safe
and
sure
return
next
kenneth
cried
ursula
she
turned
pale
and
burst
into
tears
how
can
you
think
of
leaving
me
oh
you
are
cruel
why
no
sweetheart
laughed
kenneth
the
captain
of
the
fair
lady
will
take
his
bride
with
him
we
ll
spend
our
honeymoon
on
the
high
seas
ursula
and
the
cold
canadian
winter
under
southern
you
want
me
to
run
away
with
you
kenneth
exclaimed
ursula
indeed
dear
girl
there
s
nothing
else
to
do
oh
i
can
not
she
protested
my
father
would
we
ll
not
consult
him
until
afterward
come
ursula
you
know
there
s
no
other
way
we
ve
always
known
it
must
come
to
this
your
father
will
never
forgive
me
for
my
father
you
won
t
fail
me
now
think
of
the
long
parting
if
you
send
me
away
alone
on
such
a
voyage
pluck
up
your
courage
and
we
ll
let
townleys
and
macnairs
whistle
their
mouldy
feuds
down
the
wind
while
we
sail
southward
in
the
fair
lady
i
have
a
let
me
hear
it
said
ursula
beginning
to
get
back
her
breath
there
is
to
be
a
dance
at
the
springs
friday
night
are
you
invited
ursula
good
i
am
not
but
i
shall
be
there
in
the
fir
grove
behind
the
house
with
two
horses
when
the
dancing
is
at
its
height
you
ll
steal
out
to
meet
me
then
tis
but
a
fifteen
mile
ride
to
charlottetown
where
a
good
minister
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
will
be
ready
to
marry
us
by
the
time
the
dancers
have
tired
their
heels
you
and
i
will
be
on
our
vessel
able
to
snap
our
fingers
at
and
what
if
i
do
not
meet
you
in
the
fir
grove
said
ursula
a
little
impertinently
if
you
do
not
i
ll
sail
for
south
america
the
next
morning
and
many
a
long
year
will
pass
ere
kenneth
macnair
comes
home
perhaps
kenneth
didn
t
mean
that
but
ursula
thought
he
did
and
it
decided
her
she
agreed
to
run
away
with
him
yes
of
course
that
was
wrong
too
felicity
she
ought
to
have
said
no
i
shall
be
married
respectably
from
home
and
have
a
wedding
and
a
silk
dress
and
bridesmaids
and
lots
of
but
she
didn
t
she
wasn
t
as
prudent
as
felicity
king
would
have
she
was
a
shameless
hussy
said
felicity
venting
on
the
ursula
that
anger
she
dare
not
visit
on
the
story
girl
oh
no
felicity
dear
she
was
just
a
lass
of
spirit
i
d
have
done
the
same
and
when
friday
night
came
she
began
to
dress
for
the
dance
with
a
brave
heart
she
was
to
go
to
the
springs
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
who
were
coming
on
horseback
that
afternoon
and
would
then
go
on
to
the
springs
in
old
hugh
s
carriage
which
was
the
only
one
in
carlyle
then
they
were
to
leave
in
time
to
reach
the
springs
before
nightfall
for
the
october
nights
were
dark
and
the
wooded
roads
rough
for
travelling
when
ursula
was
ready
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
with
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
yes
felicity
she
was
a
vain
baggage
that
same
ursula
but
that
kind
didn
t
all
die
out
a
hundred
years
ago
and
she
had
good
reason
for
being
vain
she
wore
the
silk
which
had
been
brought
out
from
england
a
year
before
and
worn
but
once
at
the
christmas
ball
at
government
house
a
fine
stiff
rustling
silk
it
was
and
over
it
shone
ursula
s
crimson
cheeks
and
gleaming
eyes
and
masses
of
nut
brown
hair
as
she
turned
from
the
glass
she
heard
her
father
s
voice
below
loud
and
angry
growing
very
pale
she
ran
out
into
the
hall
her
father
was
already
half
way
upstairs
his
face
red
with
fury
in
the
hall
below
ursula
saw
her
looking
troubled
and
vexed
at
the
door
stood
malcolm
ramsay
a
homely
neighbour
youth
who
had
been
courting
ursula
in
his
clumsy
way
ever
since
she
grew
up
ursula
had
always
hated
him
ursula
shouted
old
hugh
come
here
and
tell
this
scoundrel
he
lies
he
says
that
you
met
kenneth
macnair
in
the
beechgrove
last
tuesday
tell
him
he
lies
tell
him
he
lies
ursula
was
no
coward
she
looked
scornfully
at
poor
ramsay
the
creature
is
a
spy
and
a
she
said
but
in
this
he
does
not
lie
i
did
meet
kenneth
macnair
last
and
you
dare
to
tell
me
this
to
my
face
roared
old
hugh
back
to
your
room
girl
back
to
your
room
and
stay
there
take
off
that
finery
you
go
to
no
more
dances
you
shall
stay
in
that
room
until
i
choose
to
let
you
out
no
not
a
word
i
ll
put
you
there
if
you
don
t
go
in
with
you
ay
and
take
your
knitting
with
you
occupy
yourself
with
that
this
evening
instead
of
kicking
your
heels
at
the
springs
he
snatched
a
roll
of
gray
stocking
from
the
hall
table
and
flung
it
into
ursula
s
room
ursula
knew
she
would
have
to
follow
it
or
be
picked
up
and
carried
in
like
a
naughty
child
so
she
gave
the
miserable
ramsay
a
look
that
made
him
cringe
and
swept
into
her
room
with
her
head
in
the
air
the
next
moment
she
heard
the
door
locked
behind
her
her
first
proceeding
was
to
have
a
cry
of
anger
and
shame
and
disappointment
that
did
no
good
and
then
she
took
to
marching
up
and
down
her
room
it
did
not
calm
her
to
hear
the
rumble
of
the
carriage
out
of
the
gate
as
her
uncle
and
aunt
departed
oh
what
s
to
be
done
she
sobbed
kenneth
will
be
furious
he
will
think
i
have
failed
him
and
he
will
go
away
hot
with
anger
against
me
if
i
could
only
send
a
word
of
explanation
i
know
he
would
not
leave
me
but
there
seems
to
be
no
way
at
all
though
i
have
heard
that
there
s
always
a
way
when
there
s
a
will
oh
i
shall
go
mad
if
the
window
were
not
so
high
i
would
jump
out
of
it
but
to
break
my
legs
or
my
neck
would
not
mend
the
the
afternoon
passed
on
at
sunset
ursula
heard
and
ran
to
the
window
andrew
kinnear
of
the
springs
was
tying
his
horse
at
the
door
he
was
a
dashing
young
fellow
and
a
political
crony
of
old
hugh
no
doubt
he
would
be
at
the
dance
that
night
oh
if
she
could
get
speech
for
but
a
moment
with
him
when
he
had
gone
into
the
house
ursula
turning
impatiently
from
the
window
tripped
and
almost
fell
over
the
big
ball
of
homespun
yarn
her
father
had
flung
on
the
floor
for
a
moment
she
gazed
at
it
resentfully
then
with
a
gay
little
laugh
she
pounced
on
it
the
next
moment
she
was
at
her
table
writing
a
brief
note
to
kenneth
macnair
when
it
was
written
ursula
unwound
the
gray
ball
to
a
considerable
depth
pinned
the
note
on
it
and
rewound
the
yarn
over
it
a
gray
ball
the
color
of
the
twilight
might
escape
observation
where
a
white
missive
fluttering
down
from
an
upper
window
would
surely
be
seen
by
someone
then
she
softly
opened
her
window
and
waited
it
was
dusk
when
andrew
went
away
fortunately
old
hugh
did
not
come
to
the
door
with
him
as
andrew
untied
his
horse
ursula
threw
the
ball
with
such
good
aim
that
it
struck
him
as
she
had
meant
it
to
do
squarely
on
the
head
andrew
looked
up
at
her
window
she
leaned
out
put
her
finger
warningly
on
her
lips
pointed
to
the
ball
and
nodded
andrew
looking
somewhat
puzzled
picked
up
the
ball
sprang
to
his
saddle
and
galloped
off
so
far
well
thought
ursula
but
would
andrew
understand
would
he
have
wit
enough
to
think
of
exploring
the
big
knobby
ball
for
its
delicate
secret
and
would
he
be
at
the
dance
after
all
the
evening
dragged
by
time
had
never
seemed
so
long
to
ursula
she
could
not
rest
or
sleep
it
was
midnight
before
she
heard
the
patter
of
a
handful
of
gravel
on
her
in
a
trice
she
was
leaning
out
below
in
the
darkness
stood
kenneth
macnair
oh
kenneth
did
you
get
my
letter
and
is
it
safe
for
you
to
be
here
safe
enough
your
father
is
in
bed
i
ve
waited
two
hours
down
the
road
for
his
light
to
go
out
and
an
extra
to
put
him
to
sleep
the
horses
are
there
slip
down
and
out
ursula
we
ll
make
charlottetown
by
dawn
that
s
easier
said
than
done
lad
i
m
locked
in
but
do
you
go
out
behind
the
new
barn
and
bring
the
ladder
you
will
find
five
minutes
later
miss
ursula
hooded
and
cloaked
scrambled
soundlessly
down
the
ladder
and
in
five
more
minutes
she
and
kenneth
were
riding
along
the
road
there
s
a
stiff
gallop
before
us
ursula
said
kenneth
i
would
ride
to
the
world
s
end
with
you
kenneth
macnair
said
ursula
oh
of
course
she
shouldn
t
have
said
anything
of
the
sort
felicity
but
you
see
people
had
no
etiquette
departments
in
those
days
and
when
the
red
sunlight
of
a
fair
october
dawn
was
shining
over
the
gray
sea
the
fair
lady
sailed
out
of
charlottetown
harbour
on
her
deck
stood
kenneth
and
ursula
macnair
and
in
her
hand
as
a
most
precious
treasure
the
bride
carried
a
ball
of
gray
homespun
well
said
dan
yawning
i
like
that
kind
of
a
story
nobody
goes
and
dies
in
it
that
s
one
good
did
old
hugh
forgive
ursula
i
asked
the
story
stopped
there
in
the
brown
book
said
the
story
girl
but
the
awkward
man
says
he
did
after
it
must
be
rather
romantic
to
be
run
away
with
remarked
cecily
wistfully
don
t
you
get
such
silly
notions
in
your
head
cecily
king
said
felicity
severely
chapter
iii
the
christmas
harp
great
was
the
excitement
in
the
houses
of
king
as
christmas
drew
nigh
the
air
was
simply
charged
with
secrets
everybody
was
very
penurious
for
weeks
beforehand
and
hoards
were
counted
scrutinizingly
every
day
mysterious
pieces
of
handiwork
were
smuggled
in
and
out
of
sight
and
whispered
consultations
were
held
about
which
nobody
thought
of
being
jealous
as
might
have
happened
at
any
other
time
felicity
was
in
her
element
for
she
and
her
mother
were
deep
in
preparations
for
the
day
cecily
and
the
story
girl
were
excluded
from
these
doings
with
indifference
on
aunt
janet
s
part
and
what
seemed
ostentatious
complacency
on
felicity
s
cecily
took
this
to
heart
and
complained
to
me
about
it
i
m
one
of
this
family
just
as
much
as
felicity
is
she
said
with
as
much
indignation
as
cecily
could
feel
and
i
don
t
think
she
need
shut
me
out
of
everything
when
i
wanted
to
stone
the
raisins
for
the
she
said
no
she
would
do
it
herself
because
christmas
was
very
particular
as
if
i
couldn
t
stone
raisins
right
the
airs
felicity
puts
on
about
her
cooking
just
make
me
sick
concluded
cecily
wrathfully
it
s
a
pity
she
doesn
t
make
a
mistake
in
cooking
once
in
a
while
herself
i
said
then
maybe
she
wouldn
t
think
she
knew
so
much
more
than
other
all
parcels
that
came
in
the
mail
from
distant
friends
were
taken
charge
of
by
aunts
janet
and
olivia
not
to
be
opened
until
the
great
day
of
the
feast
itself
how
slowly
the
last
week
passed
but
even
watched
pots
will
boil
in
the
fulness
of
time
and
finally
christmas
day
came
gray
and
dour
and
without
but
full
of
revelry
and
mirth
within
uncle
roger
and
aunt
olivia
and
the
story
girl
came
over
early
for
the
day
and
peter
came
too
with
his
shining
morning
face
to
be
hailed
with
joy
for
we
had
been
afraid
that
peter
would
not
be
able
to
spend
christmas
with
us
his
mother
had
wanted
him
home
with
her
of
course
i
ought
to
go
peter
had
told
me
mournfully
but
we
won
t
have
turkey
for
dinner
because
ma
can
t
afford
it
and
ma
always
cries
on
holidays
because
she
says
they
make
her
think
of
father
of
course
she
can
t
help
it
but
it
ain
t
cheerful
aunt
jane
wouldn
t
have
cried
aunt
jane
used
to
say
she
never
saw
the
man
who
was
worth
spoiling
her
eyes
for
but
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
spend
christmas
at
at
the
last
moment
however
a
cousin
of
craig
s
in
charlottetown
invited
her
for
christmas
and
peter
being
given
his
choice
of
going
or
staying
joyfully
elected
to
stay
so
we
were
all
together
except
sara
ray
who
had
been
invited
but
whose
mother
wouldn
t
let
her
come
sara
ray
s
mother
is
a
nuisance
snapped
the
story
girl
she
just
lives
to
make
that
poor
child
miserable
and
she
won
t
let
her
go
to
the
party
tonight
it
is
just
breaking
sara
s
heart
that
she
can
t
said
cecily
compassionately
i
m
almost
afraid
i
won
t
enjoy
myself
for
thinking
of
her
home
there
alone
most
likely
reading
the
bible
while
we
re
at
the
she
might
be
worse
occupied
than
reading
the
bible
said
felicity
rebukingly
but
ray
makes
her
read
it
as
a
punishment
protested
cecily
whenever
sara
cries
to
go
anywhere
and
of
course
she
ll
cry
tonight
ray
makes
her
read
seven
chapters
in
the
bible
i
wouldn
t
think
that
would
make
her
very
fond
of
it
and
i
ll
not
be
able
to
talk
the
party
over
with
sara
afterwards
and
that
s
half
the
fun
you
can
tell
her
all
about
it
comforted
felix
telling
isn
t
a
bit
like
talking
it
over
retorted
cecily
it
s
too
we
had
an
exciting
time
opening
our
presents
some
of
us
had
more
than
others
but
we
all
received
enough
to
make
us
feel
comfortably
that
we
were
not
unduly
neglected
in
the
matter
the
contents
of
the
box
which
the
story
girl
s
father
had
sent
her
from
paris
made
our
eyes
stick
out
it
was
full
of
beautiful
things
among
them
another
red
silk
dress
not
the
bright
tint
of
her
old
one
but
a
rich
dark
crimson
with
the
most
distracting
flounces
and
bows
and
ruffles
and
with
it
were
little
red
satin
slippers
with
gold
buckles
and
heels
that
made
aunt
janet
hold
up
her
hands
in
horror
felicity
remarked
scornfully
that
she
would
have
thought
the
story
girl
would
get
tired
wearing
red
so
much
and
even
cecily
commented
apart
to
me
that
she
thought
when
you
got
so
many
things
all
at
once
you
didn
t
appreciate
them
as
much
as
when
you
only
got
a
few
i
d
never
get
tired
of
red
said
the
story
girl
i
just
love
it
it
s
so
rich
and
glowing
when
i
m
dressed
in
red
i
always
feel
ever
so
much
cleverer
than
in
any
other
colour
thoughts
just
crowd
into
my
brain
one
after
the
other
oh
you
darling
dress
you
dear
sheeny
glistening
silky
thing
she
flung
it
over
her
shoulder
and
danced
around
the
kitchen
don
t
be
silly
sara
said
aunt
janet
a
little
stimy
she
was
a
good
soul
that
aunt
janet
and
had
a
kind
loving
heart
in
her
ample
bosom
but
i
fancy
there
were
times
when
she
thought
it
rather
hard
that
the
daughter
of
a
roving
adventurer
as
she
considered
him
like
blair
stanley
should
disport
herself
in
silk
dresses
while
her
own
daughters
must
go
clad
in
gingham
and
muslin
for
those
were
the
days
when
a
feminine
creature
got
one
silk
dress
in
her
lifetime
and
seldom
more
than
one
the
story
girl
also
got
a
present
from
the
awkward
man
a
little
shabby
worn
volume
with
a
great
many
marks
on
the
leaves
why
it
isn
t
new
it
s
an
old
book
exclaimed
felicity
i
didn
t
think
the
awkward
man
was
mean
whatever
else
he
oh
you
don
t
understand
felicity
said
the
story
girl
patiently
and
i
don
t
suppose
i
can
make
you
understand
but
i
ll
try
i
d
ten
times
rather
have
this
than
a
new
book
it
s
one
of
his
own
don
t
you
see
one
that
he
has
read
a
hundred
times
and
loved
and
made
a
friend
of
a
new
book
just
out
of
a
shop
wouldn
t
be
the
same
thing
at
all
it
wouldn
t
mean
anything
i
consider
it
a
great
compliment
that
he
has
given
me
this
book
i
m
prouder
of
it
than
of
anything
else
i
ve
well
you
re
welcome
to
it
said
felicity
i
don
t
understand
and
i
don
t
want
to
i
wouldn
t
give
anybody
a
christmas
present
that
wasn
t
new
and
i
wouldn
t
thank
anybody
who
gave
me
peter
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
because
felicity
had
given
him
a
present
and
moreover
one
that
she
had
made
herself
it
was
a
bookmark
of
perforated
cardboard
with
a
gorgeous
red
and
yellow
worsted
goblet
worked
on
it
and
below
in
green
letters
the
solemn
warning
touch
not
the
as
peter
was
not
addicted
to
habits
of
intemperance
not
even
to
looking
on
dandelion
wine
when
it
was
pale
yellow
we
did
not
exactly
see
why
felicity
should
have
selected
such
a
device
but
peter
was
perfectly
satisfied
so
nobody
cast
any
blight
on
his
happiness
by
carping
criticism
later
on
felicity
told
me
she
had
worked
the
bookmark
for
him
because
his
father
used
to
drink
before
he
ran
away
i
thought
peter
ought
to
be
warned
in
time
she
said
even
pat
had
a
ribbon
of
blue
which
he
clawed
off
and
lost
half
an
hour
after
it
was
tied
on
him
pat
did
not
care
for
vain
adornments
of
the
body
we
had
a
glorious
christmas
dinner
fit
for
the
halls
of
lucullus
and
ate
far
more
than
was
good
for
us
none
daring
to
make
us
afraid
on
that
one
day
of
the
year
and
in
the
evening
oh
rapture
and
delight
we
went
to
kitty
marr
s
party
it
was
a
fine
december
evening
the
sharp
air
of
morning
had
mellowed
until
it
was
as
mild
as
autumn
there
had
been
no
snow
and
the
long
fields
sloping
down
from
the
homestead
were
brown
and
mellow
a
weird
dreamy
stillness
had
fallen
on
the
purple
earth
the
dark
fir
woods
the
valley
rims
the
sere
meadows
nature
seemed
to
have
folded
satisfied
hands
to
rest
knowing
that
her
long
wintry
slumber
was
coming
upon
her
at
first
when
the
invitations
to
the
party
had
come
aunt
janet
had
said
we
could
not
go
but
uncle
alec
interceded
in
our
favour
perhaps
influenced
thereto
by
cecily
s
wistful
eyes
if
uncle
alec
had
a
favourite
among
his
children
it
was
cecily
and
he
had
grown
even
more
indulgent
towards
her
of
late
now
and
then
i
saw
him
looking
at
her
intently
and
following
his
eyes
and
thought
i
had
somehow
seen
that
cecily
was
paler
and
thinner
than
she
had
been
in
the
summer
and
that
her
soft
eyes
seemed
larger
and
that
over
her
little
face
in
moments
of
repose
there
was
a
certain
languor
and
weariness
that
made
it
very
sweet
and
pathetic
and
i
heard
him
tell
aunt
janet
that
he
did
not
like
to
see
the
child
getting
so
much
the
look
of
her
aunt
felicity
cecily
is
perfectly
well
said
aunt
janet
sharply
she
s
only
growing
very
fast
don
t
be
foolish
but
after
that
cecily
had
cups
of
cream
where
the
rest
of
us
got
only
milk
and
aunt
janet
was
very
particular
to
see
that
she
had
her
rubbers
on
whenever
she
went
out
on
this
merry
christmas
evening
however
no
fears
or
dim
foreshadowings
of
any
coming
event
clouded
our
hearts
or
faces
cecily
looked
brighter
and
prettier
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
with
her
softly
shining
eyes
and
the
nut
brown
gloss
of
her
hair
felicity
was
too
beautiful
for
words
and
even
the
story
girl
between
excitement
and
the
crimson
silk
array
blossomed
out
with
a
charm
and
allurement
more
potent
than
any
regular
loveliness
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
aunt
olivia
had
tabooed
the
red
satin
slippers
and
mercilessly
decreed
that
stout
shoes
should
be
worn
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
you
daughter
of
eve
she
said
with
gay
sympathy
but
december
roads
are
damp
and
if
you
are
going
to
walk
to
marrs
you
are
not
going
to
do
it
in
those
frivolous
parisian
concoctions
even
with
overboots
on
so
be
brave
dear
heart
and
show
that
you
have
a
soul
above
little
red
satin
anyhow
said
uncle
roger
that
red
silk
dress
will
break
the
hearts
of
all
the
feminine
small
fry
at
the
party
you
d
break
their
spirits
too
if
you
wore
the
slippers
don
t
do
it
sara
leave
them
one
wee
loophole
of
what
does
uncle
roger
mean
whispered
felicity
he
means
you
girls
are
all
dying
of
jealousy
because
of
the
story
girl
s
dress
said
dan
i
am
not
of
a
jealous
disposition
said
felicity
loftily
and
she
s
entirely
welcome
to
the
dress
with
a
complexion
like
but
we
enjoyed
that
party
hugely
every
one
of
us
and
we
enjoyed
the
walk
home
afterwards
through
dim
enshadowed
fields
where
silvery
lay
while
orion
trod
his
stately
march
above
us
and
a
red
moon
climbed
up
the
black
horizon
s
rim
a
brook
went
with
us
part
of
the
way
singing
to
us
through
the
dark
a
gay
irresponsible
vagabond
of
valley
and
wilderness
felicity
and
peter
walked
not
with
us
peter
s
cup
must
surely
have
brimmed
over
that
christmas
night
when
we
left
the
marr
house
he
had
boldly
said
to
felicity
may
i
see
you
home
and
felicity
much
to
our
amazement
had
taken
his
arm
and
marched
off
with
him
the
primness
of
her
was
indescribable
and
was
not
at
all
ruffled
by
dan
s
hoot
of
derision
as
for
me
i
was
consumed
by
a
secret
and
burning
desire
to
ask
the
story
girl
if
i
might
see
her
home
but
i
could
not
screw
my
courage
to
the
sticking
point
how
i
envied
peter
his
easy
insouciant
manner
i
could
not
emulate
him
so
dan
and
felix
and
cecily
and
the
story
girl
and
i
all
walked
hand
in
hand
huddling
a
little
closer
together
as
we
went
through
james
frewen
s
woods
for
there
are
strange
harps
in
a
fir
grove
and
who
shall
say
what
fingers
sweep
them
mighty
and
sonorous
was
the
music
above
our
heads
as
the
winds
of
the
night
stirred
the
great
boughs
tossing
athwart
the
starlit
sky
perhaps
it
was
that
aeolian
harmony
which
recalled
to
the
story
girl
a
legend
of
elder
days
i
read
such
a
pretty
story
in
one
of
aunt
olivia
s
books
last
night
she
said
it
was
called
the
christmas
would
you
like
to
hear
it
it
seems
to
me
it
would
just
suit
this
part
of
the
there
isn
t
anything
about
about
ghosts
in
it
is
there
said
cecily
timidly
oh
no
i
wouldn
t
tell
a
ghost
story
here
for
anything
i
d
frighten
myself
too
much
this
story
is
about
one
of
the
shepherds
who
saw
the
angels
on
the
first
christmas
night
he
was
just
a
youth
and
he
loved
music
with
all
his
heart
and
he
longed
to
be
able
to
express
the
melody
that
was
in
his
soul
but
he
could
not
he
had
a
harp
and
he
often
tried
to
play
on
it
but
his
clumsy
fingers
only
made
such
discord
that
his
companions
laughed
at
him
and
mocked
him
and
called
him
a
madman
because
he
would
not
give
it
up
but
would
rather
sit
apart
by
himself
with
his
arms
about
his
harp
looking
up
into
the
sky
while
they
gathered
around
their
fire
and
told
tales
to
wile
away
their
long
night
vigils
as
they
watched
their
sheep
on
the
hills
but
to
him
the
thoughts
that
came
out
of
the
great
silence
were
far
sweeter
than
their
mirth
and
he
never
gave
up
the
hope
which
sometimes
left
his
lips
as
a
prayer
that
some
day
he
might
be
able
to
express
those
thoughts
in
music
to
the
tired
weary
forgetful
world
on
the
first
christmas
night
he
was
out
with
his
fellow
shepherds
on
the
hills
it
was
chill
and
dark
and
all
except
him
were
glad
to
gather
around
the
fire
he
sat
as
usual
by
himself
with
his
harp
on
his
knee
and
a
great
longing
in
his
heart
and
there
came
a
marvellous
light
in
the
sky
and
over
the
hills
as
if
the
darkness
of
the
night
had
suddenly
blossomed
into
a
wonderful
meadow
of
flowery
flame
and
all
the
shepherds
saw
the
angels
and
heard
them
sing
and
as
they
sang
the
harp
that
the
young
shepherd
held
began
to
play
softly
by
itself
and
as
he
listened
to
it
he
realized
that
it
was
playing
the
same
music
that
the
angels
sang
and
that
all
his
secret
longings
and
aspirations
and
strivings
were
expressed
in
it
from
that
night
whenever
he
took
the
harp
in
his
hands
it
played
the
same
music
and
he
wandered
all
over
the
world
carrying
it
wherever
the
sound
of
its
music
was
heard
hate
and
discord
fled
away
and
peace
and
reigned
no
one
who
heard
it
could
think
an
evil
thought
no
one
could
feel
hopeless
or
despairing
or
bitter
or
angry
when
a
man
had
once
heard
that
music
it
entered
into
his
soul
and
heart
and
life
and
became
a
part
of
him
for
ever
years
went
by
the
shepherd
grew
old
and
bent
and
feeble
but
still
he
roamed
over
land
and
sea
that
his
harp
might
carry
the
message
of
the
christmas
night
and
the
angel
song
to
all
mankind
at
last
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
fell
by
the
wayside
in
the
darkness
but
his
harp
played
as
his
spirit
passed
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
shining
one
stood
by
him
with
wonderful
starry
eyes
and
said
to
him
lo
the
music
thy
harp
has
played
for
so
many
years
has
been
but
the
echo
of
the
love
and
sympathy
and
purity
and
beauty
in
thine
own
soul
and
if
at
any
time
in
the
wanderings
thou
hadst
opened
the
door
of
that
soul
to
evil
or
envy
or
selfishness
thy
harp
would
have
ceased
to
play
now
thy
life
is
ended
but
what
thou
hast
given
to
mankind
has
no
end
and
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
so
long
will
the
heavenly
music
of
the
christmas
harp
ring
in
the
ears
of
when
the
sun
rose
the
old
shepherd
lay
dead
by
the
roadside
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
in
his
hands
was
a
harp
with
all
its
strings
we
left
the
fir
woods
as
the
tale
was
ended
and
on
the
opposite
hill
was
home
a
dim
light
in
the
kitchen
window
betokened
that
aunt
janet
had
no
idea
of
going
to
bed
until
all
her
young
fry
were
safely
housed
for
the
night
ma
s
waiting
up
for
us
said
dan
i
d
laugh
if
she
happened
to
go
to
the
door
just
as
felicity
and
peter
were
strutting
up
i
guess
she
ll
be
cross
it
s
nearly
christmas
will
soon
be
over
said
cecily
with
a
sigh
hasn
t
it
been
a
nice
one
it
s
the
first
we
ve
all
spent
together
do
you
suppose
we
ll
ever
spend
another
together
lots
of
em
said
dan
cheerily
why
not
oh
i
don
t
know
answered
cecily
her
footsteps
lagging
somewhat
only
things
seem
just
a
little
too
pleasant
to
if
willy
fraser
had
had
as
much
spunk
as
peter
miss
cecily
king
mightn
t
be
so
low
spirited
quoth
dan
significantly
cecily
tossed
her
head
and
disdained
reply
there
are
really
some
remarks
a
young
lady
must
ignore
chapter
iv
new
year
resolutions
if
we
did
not
have
a
white
christmas
we
had
a
white
new
year
midway
between
the
two
came
a
heavy
snowfall
it
was
winter
in
our
orchard
of
old
delights
then
so
truly
winter
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
summer
had
ever
dwelt
in
it
or
that
spring
would
ever
return
to
it
there
were
no
birds
to
sing
the
music
of
the
moon
and
the
path
where
the
apple
blossoms
had
fallen
were
heaped
with
less
fragrant
drifts
but
it
was
a
place
of
wonder
on
a
moonlight
night
when
the
snowy
arcades
shone
like
avenues
of
ivory
and
crystal
and
the
bare
trees
cast
traceries
upon
them
over
uncle
stephen
s
walk
where
the
snow
had
fallen
smoothly
a
spell
of
white
magic
had
been
woven
taintless
and
wonderful
it
seemed
like
a
street
of
pearl
in
the
new
jerusalem
on
new
year
s
eve
we
were
all
together
in
uncle
alec
s
kitchen
which
was
tacitly
given
over
to
our
revels
during
the
winter
evenings
the
story
girl
and
peter
were
there
of
course
and
sara
ray
s
mother
had
allowed
her
to
come
up
on
condition
that
she
should
be
home
by
eight
sharp
cecily
was
glad
to
see
her
but
the
boys
never
hailed
her
arrival
with
delight
because
since
the
dark
began
to
come
down
early
aunt
janet
always
made
one
of
us
walk
down
home
with
her
we
hated
this
because
sara
ray
was
always
so
maddeningly
of
having
an
escort
we
knew
perfectly
well
that
next
day
in
school
she
would
tell
her
chums
as
a
dead
secret
that
king
saw
her
home
from
the
hill
farm
the
night
before
now
seeing
a
young
lady
home
from
choice
and
being
sent
home
with
her
by
your
aunt
or
mother
are
two
entirely
different
things
and
we
thought
sara
ray
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
know
it
outside
there
was
a
vivid
rose
of
sunset
behind
the
cold
hills
of
fir
and
the
long
reaches
of
snowy
fields
glowed
fairily
pink
in
the
western
light
the
drifts
along
the
edges
of
the
meadows
and
down
the
lane
looked
as
if
a
series
of
breaking
waves
had
by
the
lifting
of
a
magician
s
wand
been
suddenly
transformed
into
marble
even
to
their
toppling
curls
of
foam
slowly
the
splendour
died
giving
place
to
the
mystic
beauty
of
a
winter
twilight
when
the
moon
is
rising
the
hollow
sky
was
a
cup
of
blue
the
stars
came
out
over
the
white
glens
and
the
earth
was
covered
with
a
kingly
carpet
for
the
feet
of
the
young
year
to
press
i
m
so
glad
the
snow
came
said
the
story
girl
if
it
hadn
t
the
new
year
would
have
seemed
just
as
dingy
and
worn
out
as
the
old
there
s
something
very
solemn
about
the
idea
of
a
new
year
isn
t
there
just
think
of
three
hundred
and
whole
days
with
not
a
thing
happened
in
them
i
don
t
suppose
anything
very
wonderful
will
happen
in
them
said
felix
pessimistically
to
felix
just
then
life
was
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
because
it
was
his
turn
to
go
home
with
sara
ray
it
makes
me
a
little
frightened
to
think
of
all
that
may
happen
in
them
said
cecily
miss
marwood
says
it
is
what
we
put
into
a
year
not
what
we
get
out
of
it
that
counts
at
i
m
always
glad
to
see
a
new
year
said
the
story
girl
i
wish
we
could
do
as
they
do
in
norway
the
whole
family
sits
up
until
midnight
and
then
just
as
the
clock
is
striking
twelve
the
father
opens
the
door
and
welcomes
the
new
year
in
isn
t
it
a
pretty
custom
if
ma
would
let
us
stay
up
till
twelve
we
might
do
that
too
said
dan
but
she
never
will
i
call
it
if
i
ever
have
children
i
ll
let
them
stay
up
to
watch
the
new
year
in
said
the
story
girl
decidedly
so
will
i
said
peter
but
other
nights
they
ll
have
to
go
to
bed
at
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
speaking
of
such
things
said
felicity
with
a
scandalized
face
peter
shrank
into
the
background
abashed
no
doubt
believing
that
he
had
broken
some
family
guide
precept
all
to
pieces
i
didn
t
know
it
wasn
t
proper
to
mention
children
he
muttered
apologetically
we
ought
to
make
some
new
year
resolutions
suggested
the
story
girl
new
year
s
eve
is
the
time
to
make
i
can
t
think
of
any
resolutions
i
want
to
make
said
felicity
who
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
herself
i
could
suggest
a
few
to
you
said
dan
sarcastically
there
are
so
many
i
would
like
to
make
said
cecily
that
i
m
afraid
it
wouldn
t
be
any
use
trying
to
keep
them
well
let
s
all
make
a
few
just
for
the
fun
of
it
and
see
if
we
can
keep
them
i
said
and
let
s
get
paper
and
ink
and
write
them
out
that
will
make
them
seem
more
solemn
and
and
then
pin
them
up
on
our
bedroom
walls
where
we
ll
see
them
every
day
suggested
the
story
girl
and
every
time
we
break
a
resolution
we
must
put
a
cross
opposite
it
that
will
show
us
what
progress
we
are
making
as
well
as
make
us
ashamed
if
we
have
too
many
and
let
s
have
a
roll
of
honour
in
our
magazine
suggested
felix
and
every
month
we
ll
publish
the
names
of
those
who
keep
their
resolutions
i
think
it
s
all
nonsense
said
felicity
but
she
joined
our
circle
around
the
table
though
she
sat
for
a
long
time
with
a
blank
sheet
before
her
let
s
each
make
a
resolution
in
turn
i
said
i
ll
lead
and
recalling
with
shame
certain
unpleasant
differences
of
opinion
i
had
lately
had
with
felicity
i
wrote
down
in
my
best
hand
i
shall
try
to
keep
my
temper
you
d
better
said
felicity
tactfully
it
was
dan
s
turn
next
i
can
t
think
of
anything
to
start
with
he
said
gnawing
his
penholder
fiercely
you
might
make
a
resolution
not
to
eat
poison
berries
suggested
felicity
you
d
better
make
one
not
to
nag
people
everlastingly
retorted
dan
oh
don
t
quarrel
the
last
night
of
the
old
year
implored
cecily
you
might
resolve
not
to
quarrel
any
time
suggested
sara
ray
no
sir
said
dan
emphatically
there
s
no
use
making
a
resolution
you
can
t
keep
there
are
people
in
this
family
you
ve
just
got
to
quarrel
with
if
you
want
to
live
but
i
ve
thought
of
one
i
won
t
do
things
to
spite
felicity
who
really
was
in
an
unbearable
mood
that
night
laughed
disagreeably
but
cecily
gave
her
a
fierce
nudge
which
probably
restrained
her
from
speaking
i
will
not
eat
any
apples
wrote
felix
what
on
earth
do
you
want
to
give
up
eating
apples
for
asked
peter
in
astonishment
never
mind
returned
felix
apples
make
people
fat
you
know
said
felicity
sweetly
it
seems
a
funny
kind
of
resolution
i
said
doubtfully
i
think
our
resolutions
ought
to
be
giving
up
wrong
things
or
doing
right
you
make
your
resolutions
to
suit
yourself
and
i
ll
make
mine
to
suit
myself
said
felix
defiantly
i
shall
never
get
drunk
wrote
peter
painstakingly
but
you
never
do
said
the
story
girl
in
astonishment
well
it
will
be
all
the
easier
to
keep
the
resolution
argued
peter
that
isn
t
fair
complained
dan
if
we
all
resolved
not
to
do
the
things
we
never
do
we
d
all
be
on
the
roll
of
you
let
peter
alone
said
felicity
severely
it
s
a
very
good
resolution
and
one
everybody
ought
to
i
shall
not
be
jealous
wrote
the
story
girl
but
are
you
i
asked
surprised
the
story
girl
coloured
and
nodded
of
one
thing
she
confessed
but
i
m
not
going
to
tell
what
it
i
m
jealous
sometimes
too
confessed
sara
ray
and
so
my
first
resolution
will
be
i
shall
try
not
to
feel
jealous
when
i
hear
the
other
girls
in
school
describing
all
the
sick
spells
they
ve
goodness
do
you
want
to
be
sick
demanded
felix
in
astonishment
it
makes
a
person
important
explained
sara
ray
i
am
going
to
try
to
improve
my
mind
by
reading
good
books
and
listening
to
older
people
wrote
cecily
you
got
that
out
of
the
sunday
school
paper
cried
felicity
it
doesn
t
matter
where
i
got
it
said
cecily
with
dignity
the
main
thing
is
to
keep
it
s
your
turn
felicity
i
said
felicity
tossed
her
beautiful
golden
head
i
told
you
i
wasn
t
going
to
make
any
resolutions
go
on
i
shall
always
study
my
grammar
lesson
i
wrote
i
who
loathed
grammar
with
a
deadly
loathing
i
hate
grammar
too
sighed
sara
ray
it
seems
so
sara
was
rather
fond
of
a
big
word
but
did
not
always
get
hold
of
the
right
one
i
rather
suspected
that
in
the
above
instance
she
really
meant
uninteresting
i
won
t
get
mad
at
felicity
if
i
can
help
it
wrote
dan
i
m
sure
i
never
do
anything
to
make
you
mad
exclaimed
felicity
i
don
t
think
it
s
polite
to
make
resolutions
about
your
sisters
said
peter
he
can
t
keep
it
anyway
scoffed
felicity
he
s
got
such
an
awful
it
s
a
family
failing
flashed
dan
breaking
his
resolution
ere
the
ink
on
it
was
dry
there
you
go
taunted
felicity
i
ll
work
all
my
arithmetic
problems
without
any
help
scribbled
felix
i
wish
i
could
resolve
that
too
sighed
sara
ray
but
it
wouldn
t
be
any
use
i
d
never
be
able
to
do
those
compound
multiplication
sums
the
teacher
gives
us
to
do
at
home
every
night
if
i
didn
t
get
judy
pineau
to
help
me
judy
isn
t
a
good
reader
and
she
can
t
spell
at
all
but
you
can
t
stick
her
in
arithmetic
as
far
as
she
went
herself
i
feel
sure
concluded
poor
sara
in
a
hopeless
tone
that
i
ll
never
be
able
to
understand
compound
multiplication
is
vexation
division
is
as
bad
the
rule
of
three
perplexes
me
and
fractions
drive
me
mad
quoted
dan
i
haven
t
got
as
far
as
fractions
yet
sighed
sara
and
i
hope
i
ll
be
too
big
to
go
to
school
before
i
do
i
hate
arithmetic
but
i
am
passionately
fond
of
i
will
not
play
on
the
fly
leaves
of
my
hymn
book
in
church
wrote
peter
mercy
did
you
ever
do
such
a
thing
exclaimed
felicity
in
horror
peter
nodded
shamefacedly
yes
that
sunday
bailey
preached
he
was
so
i
got
awful
tired
and
anyway
he
was
talking
about
things
i
couldn
t
understand
so
i
played
with
one
of
the
markdale
boys
it
was
the
day
i
was
sitting
up
in
the
well
i
hope
if
you
ever
do
the
like
again
you
won
t
do
it
in
our
pew
said
felicity
severely
i
ain
t
going
to
do
it
at
all
said
peter
i
felt
sort
of
mean
all
the
rest
of
the
i
shall
try
not
to
be
vexed
when
people
interrupt
me
when
i
m
telling
stories
wrote
the
story
girl
but
it
will
be
hard
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
never
mind
being
interrupted
said
felicity
i
shall
try
to
be
cheerful
and
smiling
all
the
time
wrote
cecily
you
are
anyway
said
sara
ray
loyally
i
don
t
believe
we
ought
to
be
cheerful
all
the
time
said
the
story
girl
the
bible
says
we
ought
to
weep
with
those
who
but
maybe
it
means
that
we
re
to
weep
cheerfully
suggested
cecily
sorter
as
if
you
were
thinking
i
m
very
sorry
for
you
but
i
m
mighty
glad
i
m
not
in
the
scrape
too
said
dan
dan
don
t
be
irreverent
rebuked
felicity
i
know
a
story
about
old
and
davidson
of
markdale
said
the
story
girl
she
was
always
smiling
and
it
used
to
aggravate
her
husband
so
one
day
he
said
very
crossly
old
lady
what
are
you
grinning
at
oh
well
abiram
everything
s
so
bright
and
pleasant
i
ve
just
got
to
not
long
after
there
came
a
time
when
everything
went
wrong
the
crop
failed
and
their
best
cow
died
and
davidson
had
rheumatism
and
finally
davidson
fell
and
broke
his
leg
but
still
davidson
smiled
what
in
the
dickens
are
you
grinning
about
now
old
lady
he
demanded
oh
well
abiram
she
said
everything
is
so
dark
and
unpleasant
i
ve
just
got
to
well
said
the
old
man
crossly
i
think
you
might
give
your
face
a
rest
i
shall
not
talk
gossip
wrote
sara
ray
with
a
satisfied
air
oh
don
t
you
think
that
s
a
little
too
strict
asked
cecily
anxiously
of
course
it
s
not
right
to
talk
mean
gossip
but
the
harmless
kind
doesn
t
hurt
if
i
say
to
you
that
emmy
macphail
is
going
to
get
a
new
fur
collar
this
winter
that
is
harmless
gossip
but
if
i
say
i
don
t
see
how
emmy
macphail
can
afford
a
new
fur
collar
when
her
father
can
t
pay
my
father
for
the
oats
he
got
from
him
that
would
be
mean
gossip
if
i
were
you
sara
i
d
put
mean
sara
consented
to
this
amendment
i
will
be
polite
to
everybody
was
my
third
resolution
which
passed
without
comment
i
ll
try
not
to
use
slang
since
cecily
doesn
t
like
it
wrote
dan
i
think
some
slang
is
real
cute
said
felicity
the
family
guide
says
it
s
very
vulgar
grinned
dan
doesn
t
it
sara
stanley
don
t
disturb
me
said
the
story
girl
dreamily
i
m
just
thinking
a
beautiful
i
ve
thought
of
a
resolution
to
make
cried
felicity
mr
marwood
said
last
sunday
we
should
always
try
to
think
beautiful
thoughts
and
then
our
lives
would
be
very
beautiful
so
i
shall
resolve
to
think
a
beautiful
thought
every
morning
before
can
you
only
manage
one
a
day
queried
dan
and
why
before
breakfast
i
asked
because
it
s
easier
to
think
on
an
empty
stomach
said
peter
in
all
good
faith
but
felicity
shot
a
furious
glance
at
him
i
selected
that
time
she
explained
with
dignity
because
when
i
m
brushing
my
hair
before
my
glass
in
the
morning
i
ll
see
my
resolution
and
remember
mr
marwood
meant
that
all
our
thoughts
ought
to
be
beautiful
said
the
story
girl
if
they
were
people
wouldn
t
be
afraid
to
say
what
they
they
oughtn
t
to
be
afraid
to
anyhow
said
felix
stoutly
i
m
going
to
make
a
resolution
to
say
just
what
i
think
and
do
you
expect
to
get
through
the
year
alive
if
you
do
asked
dan
it
might
be
easy
enough
to
say
what
you
think
if
you
could
always
be
sure
just
what
you
do
think
said
the
story
girl
so
often
i
can
t
be
how
would
you
like
it
if
people
always
said
just
what
they
think
to
you
asked
felicity
i
m
not
very
particular
what
some
people
think
of
me
rejoined
felix
i
notice
you
don
t
like
to
be
told
by
anybody
that
you
re
fat
retorted
felicity
oh
dear
me
i
do
wish
you
wouldn
t
all
say
such
sarcastic
things
to
each
other
said
poor
cecily
plaintively
it
sounds
so
horrid
the
last
night
of
the
old
year
dear
knows
where
we
ll
all
be
this
night
next
year
peter
it
s
your
i
will
try
wrote
peter
to
say
my
prayers
every
night
regular
and
not
twice
one
night
because
i
don
t
expect
to
have
time
the
next
like
i
did
the
night
before
the
party
he
added
i
s
pose
you
never
said
your
prayers
until
we
got
you
to
go
to
church
said
felicity
who
had
had
no
hand
in
inducing
peter
to
go
to
church
but
had
stoutly
opposed
it
as
recorded
in
the
first
volume
of
our
family
history
i
did
too
said
peter
aunt
jane
taught
me
to
say
my
prayers
ma
hadn
t
time
being
as
father
had
run
away
ma
had
to
wash
at
night
same
as
in
i
shall
learn
to
cook
wrote
the
story
girl
frowning
you
d
better
resolve
not
to
make
puddings
of
began
felicity
then
stopped
as
suddenly
as
if
she
had
bitten
off
the
rest
of
her
sentence
and
swallowed
it
cecily
had
nudged
her
so
she
had
probably
remembered
the
story
girl
s
threat
that
she
would
never
tell
another
story
if
she
was
ever
twitted
with
the
pudding
she
had
made
from
sawdust
but
we
all
knew
what
felicity
had
started
to
say
and
the
story
girl
dealt
her
a
most
uncousinly
glance
i
will
not
cry
because
mother
won
t
starch
my
aprons
wrote
sara
ray
better

not
to

about
anything

dan
kindly
sara
ray
shook
her
head
forlornly
that
would
be
too
hard
to
keep
there
are
times
when
i
have
to
cry
it
s
a
not
to
the
folks
who
have
to
hear

muttered
dan
aside
to
cecily
oh
hush
whispered
cecily
back
don
t
go
and
hurt
her
feelings
the
last
night
of
the
old
year
is
it
my
turn
again
well
i
ll
resolve
not
to
worry
because
my
hair
is
not
curly
but
oh
i
ll
never
be
able
to
help
wishing
it
why
don
t
you
curl
it
as
you
used
to
do
then
asked
dan
you
know
very
well
that
i
ve
never
put
my
hair
up
in
curl
papers
since
the
time
peter
was
dying
of
the
measles
said
cecily
reproachfully
i
resolved
then
i
wouldn
t
because
i
wasn
t
sure
it
was
quite
i
will
keep
my

you
ought
to
like
reading
the
bible
without
trying
to
exclaimed
felicity
if
you
had
to
read
seven
chapters
of
it
every
time
you
were
naughty
i
don
t
believe
you
would
like
it
either
retorted
sara
ray
with
a
flash
of
spirit
i
shall
try
to
believe
only
half
of
what
i
hear
was
cecily
s
concluding
resolution
but
which
half
scoffed
dan
the
best
half
said
sweet
cecily
simply
i
ll
try
to
obey
mother
always
wrote
sara
ray
with
a
tremendous
sigh
as
if
she
fully
realized
the
difficulty
of
keeping
such
a
resolution
and
that
s
all
i
m
going
to
felicity
has
only
made
one
said
the
story
girl
i
think
it
better
to
make
just
one
and
keep
it
than
make
a
lot
and
break
them
said
felicity
loftily
she
had
the
last
word
on
the
subject
for
it
was
time
for
sara
ray
to
go
and
our
circle
broke
up
sara
and
felix
departed
and
we
watched
them
down
the
lane
in
the
moonlight
sara
walking
demurely
in
one
runner
track
and
felix
stalking
grimly
along
in
the
other
i
fear
the
romantic
beauty
of
that
silver
shining
night
was
entirely
thrown
away
on
my
mischievous
brother
and
it
was
as
i
remember
it
a
most
exquisite
night
a
white
poem
a
frosty
starry
lyric
of
light
it
was
one
of
those
nights
on
which
one
might
fall
asleep
and
dream
happy
dreams
of
gardens
of
mirth
and
song
feeling
all
the
while
through
one
s
sleep
the
soft
splendour
and
radiance
of
the
white
outside
as
one
hears
soft
music
sounding
through
the
thoughts
and
words
that
are
born
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
cecily
dreamed
that
night
that
she
saw
three
full
moons
in
the
sky
and
wakened
up
crying
with
the
horror
of
it
chapter
the
first
number
of
our
magazine
the
first
number
of
our
magazine
was
ready
on
new
year
s
day
and
we
read
it
that
evening
in
the
kitchen
all
our
staff
had
worked
nobly
and
we
were
enormously
proud
of
the
result
although
dan
still
continued
to
scoff
at
a
paper
that
wasn
t
printed
the
story
girl
and
i
read
it
turnabout
while
the
others
except
felix
ate
apples
it
opened
with
a
short
editorial
with
this
number
our
magazine
makes
its
first
bow
to
the
public
all
the
editors
have
done
their
best
and
the
various
departments
are
full
of
valuable
information
and
amusement
the
tastefully
designed
cover
is
by
a
famous
artist
blair
stanley
who
sent
it
to
us
all
the
way
from
europe
at
the
request
of
his
daughter

none
the
worse
for
being

old

it
is
new

most
of
our
readers
miss
cecily
king
contributes
a
thrilling
article
of
adventure
the
various
departments
are
ably
edited
and
we
feel
that
we
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
our
magazine
but
we
shall
not
rest
on
our
oars
excelsior
shall
ever
be
our
motto
we
trust
that
each
succeeding
issue
will
be
better
than
the
one
that
went
before
we
are
well
aware
of
many
defects
but
it
is
easier
to
see
them
than
to
remedy
them
any
suggestion
that
would
tend
to
the
improvement
of
our
magazine
will
be
thankfully
received
but
we
trust
that
no
criticism
will
be
made
that
will
hurt
anyone
s
feelings
let
us
all
work
together
in
harmony
and
strive
to
make
our
magazine
an
influence
for
good
and
a
source
of
innocent
pleasure
and
let
us
always
remember
the
words
of
the
poet
the
heights
by
great
men
reached
and
kept
were
not
attained
by
sudden
flight
but
they
while
their
companions
slept
were
toiling
upwards
in
the
peter
impressively
i
ve
read
many
a
worse
editorial
in
the
essay
on
shakespeare
shakespeare
s
full
name
was
william
shakespeare
he
did
not
always
spell
it
the
same
way
he
lived
in
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
and
wrote
a
great
many
plays
his
plays
are
written
in
dialogue
form
some
people
think
they
were
not
written
by
shakespeare
but
by
another
man
of
the
same
name
i
have
read
some
of
them
because
our
school
teacher
says
everybody
ought
to
read
them
but
i
did
not
care
much
for
them
there
are
some
things
in
them
i
can
not
understand
i
like
the
stories
of
valeria
montague
in
the
family
guide
ever
so
much
better
they
are
more
exciting
and
truer
to
life
romeo
and
juliet
was
one
of
the
plays
i
read
it
was
very
sad
juliet
dies
and
i
don
t
like
stories
where
people
die
i
like
it
better
when
they
all
get
married
especially
to
dukes
and
earls
shakespeare
himself
was
married
to
anne
hatheway
they
are
both
dead
now
they
have
been
dead
a
good
while
he
was
a
very
famous
man
felicity
king
peter
modestly
i
don
t
know
much
about
shakespeare
myself
but
i
ve
got
a
book
of
his
plays
that
belonged
to
my
aunt
jane
and
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
tackle
him
as
soon
as
i
finish
with
the
the
story
of
an
elopement
from
church
this
is
a
true
story
it
happened
in
markdale
to
an
uncle
of
my
mothers
he
wanted
to
marry
miss
jemima
parr
felicity
says
jemima
is
not
a
romantic
name
for
a
heroin
of
a
story
but
i
cant
help
it
in
this
case
because
it
is
a
true
story
and
her
name
realy
was
jemima
my
mothers
uncle
was
named
thomas
taylor
he
was
poor
at
that
time
and
so
the
father
of
miss
jemima
parr
did
not
want
him
for
a
soninlaw
and
told
him
he
was
not
to
come
near
the
house
or
he
would
set
the
dog
on
him
miss
jemima
parr
was
very
pretty
and
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
was
just
crazy
about
her
and
she
wanted
him
too
she
cried
almost
every
night
after
her
father
forbid
him
to
come
to
the
house
except
the
nights
she
had
to
sleep
or
she
would
have
died
and
she
was
so
frightened
he
might
try
to
come
for
all
and
get
tore
up
by
the
dog
and
it
was
a
too
that
would
never
let
go
but
mothers
uncle
thomas
was
too
cute
for
that
he
waited
till
one
day
there
was
preaching
in
the
markdale
church
in
the
middle
of
the
week
because
it
was
sacrament
time
and
miss
jemima
parr
and
her
family
all
went
because
her
father
was
an
elder
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
went
too
and
set
in
the
pew
just
behind
miss
jemima
parrs
family
when
they
all
bowed
their
heads
at
prayer
time
miss
jemima
parr
didnt
but
set
bolt
uprite
and
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
bent
over
and
wispered
in
her
ear
i
dont
know
what
he
said
so
i
cant
right
it
but
miss
jemima
parr
blushed
that
is
turned
red
and
nodded
her
head
perhaps
some
people
may
think
that
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
shouldent
of
wispered
at
prayer
time
in
church
but
you
must
remember
that
miss
jemima
parrs
father
had
thretened
to
set
the
dog
on
him
and
that
was
hard
lines
when
he
was
a
respektable
young
man
though
not
rich
well
when
they
were
singing
the
last
sam
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
got
up
and
went
out
very
quitely
and
as
soon
as
church
was
out
miss
jemima
parr
walked
out
too
real
quick
her
family
never
suspekted
anything
and
they
hung
round
talking
to
folks
and
shaking
hands
while
miss
jemima
parr
and
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
were
eloping
outside
and
what
do
you
suppose
they
eloped
in
why
in
miss
jemima
parrs
fathers
slay
and
when
he
went
out
they
were
gone
and
his
slay
was
gone
also
his
horse
of
course
my
mothers
uncle
thomas
didnt
steal
the
horse
he
just
borroed
it
and
sent
it
home
the
next
day
but
before
miss
jemima
parrs
father
could
get
another
rig
to
follow
them
they
were
so
far
away
he
couldent
catch
them
before
they
got
married
and
they
lived
happy
together
forever
afterwards
mothers
uncle
thomas
lived
to
be
a
very
old
man
he
died
very
suddent
he
felt
quite
well
when
he
went
to
sleep
and
when
he
woke
up
he
was
dead
peter
craig
my
most
exciting
adventure
the
editor
says
we
must
all
write
up
our
most
exciting
adventure
for
our
magazine
my
most
exciting
adventure
happened
a
year
ago
last
november
i
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
dan
says
he
wouldn
t
of
been
scared
and
felicity
says
she
would
of
known
what
it
was
but
it
s
easy
to
talk
it
happened
the
night
i
went
down
to
see
kitty
marr
i
thought
when
i
went
that
aunt
olivia
was
visiting
there
and
i
could
come
home
with
her
but
she
wasn
t
there
and
i
had
to
come
home
alone
kitty
came
a
piece
of
the
way
but
she
wouldn
t
come
any
further
than
uncle
james
frewen
s
gate
she
said
it
was
because
it
was
so
windy
she
was
afraid
she
would
get
the
and
not
because
she
was
frightened
of
the
ghost
of
the
dog
that
haunted
the
bridge
in
uncle
james
hollow
i
did
wish
she
hadn
t
said
anything
about
the
dog
because
i
mightn
t
of
thought
about
it
if
she
hadn
t
i
had
to
go
on
alone
thinking
of
it
i
d
heard
the
story
often
but
i
d
never
believed
in
it
they
said
the
dog
used
to
appear
at
one
end
of
the
bridge
and
walk
across
it
with
people
and
vanish
when
he
got
to
the
other
end
he
never
tried
to
bite
anyone
but
one
wouldn
t
want
to
meet
the
ghost
of
a
dog
even
if
one
didn
t
believe
in
him
i
knew
there
was
no
such
thing
as
ghosts
and
i
kept
saying
a
paraphrase
over
to
myself
and
the
golden
text
of
the
next
sunday
school
lesson
but
oh
how
my
heart
beat
when
i
got
near
the
hollow
it
was
so
dark
you
could
just
see
things
but
you
couldn
t
see
what
they
were
when
i
got
to
the
bridge
i
walked
along
sideways
with
my
back
to
the
railing
so
i
couldn
t
think
the
dog
was
behind
me
and
then
just
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
i
met
something
it
was
right
before
me
and
it
was
big
and
black
just
about
the
size
of
a
newfoundland
dog
and
i
thought
i
could
see
a
white
nose
and
it
kept
jumping
about
from
one
side
of
the
bridge
to
the
other
oh
i
hope
none
of
my
readers
will
ever
be
so
frightened
as
i
was
then
i
was
too
frightened
to
run
back
because
i
was
afraid
it
would
chase
me
and
i
couldn
t
get
past
it
it
moved
so
quick
and
then
it
just
made
one
spring
right
on
me
and
i
felt
its
claws
and
i
screamed
and
fell
down
it
rolled
off
to
one
side
and
laid
there
quite
quiet
but
i
didn
t
dare
move
and
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
amos
cowan
hadn
t
come
along
that
very
minute
with
a
lantern
and
there
was
me
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
and
that
awful
thing
beside
me
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
but
a
big
umbrella
with
a
white
handle
amos
said
it
was
his
umbrella
and
it
had
blown
away
from
him
and
he
had
to
go
back
and
get
the
lantern
to
look
for
it
i
felt
like
asking
him
what
on
earth
he
was
going
about
with
an
umbrella
open
when
it
wasent
raining
but
the
cowans
do
such
queer
things
you
remember
the
time
jerry
cowan
sold
us
god
s
picture
amos
took
me
right
home
and
i
was
thankful
for
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
he
hadn
t
come
along
i
couldn
t
sleep
all
night
and
i
never
want
to
have
any
more
adventures
like
that
one

one
piece
peter
craig
thinks
he
saw
the
family
ghost
on

eve

rest

all
he
saw
was
the
white
calf
with
the
red
tail
peter
muttering
sulkily
it
s
a
queer
calf
that
would
walk
up
on

and
wring
its
miss

spent
the
night
of

yes
you
should
offer
your
arm
to
a
lady
when
seeing
her
home
but
don
t
keep
her
standing
too
long
at
the
gate
while
you
say
good
night
felix
enraged
i
never
asked
such
a
no
it
is
not
polite
to
use
holy
moses
or
dodgasted
in
ordinary
conversation
cecily
had
gone
down
cellar
to
replenish
the
apple
plate
so
this
passed
without
protest
no
it
isn
t
polite
to
cry
all
the
time
as
to
whether
you
should
ask
a
young
man
in
it
all
depends
on
whether
he
went
home
with
you
of
his
own
accord
or
was
sent
by
some

it
does

if

for

funny
paragraphs
this
is
a
true
joke
and
really
happened
there
was
an
old
local
preacher
in
new
brunswick
one
time
whose
name
was
samuel
clask
he
used
to
preach
and
pray
and
visit
the
sick
just
like
a
regular
minister
one
day
he
was
visiting
a
neighbour
who
was
dying
and
he
prayed
the
lord
to
have
mercy
on
him
because
he
was
very
poor
and
had
worked
so
hard
all
his
life
that
he
hadn
t
much
time
to
attend
to
religion
and
if
you
don
t
believe
me
o
lord
clask
finished
up
with
just
take
a
look
at
his
felix
king
general
information
bureau
dan
do
porpoises
grow
on
trees
or
vines
ans
neither
they
inhabit
the
deep
sea
felix
king
dan
aggrieved
well
i
d
never
heard
of
porpoises
and
it
sounded
like
something
that
grew
but
you
needn
t
have
gone
and
put
it
in
the
felix
it
isn
t
any
worse
than
the
things
you
put
in
about
me
that
i
never
asked
at
cecily
soothingly
oh
well
boys
it
s
all
in
fun
and
i
think
our
magazine
is
perfectly
felicity
failing
to
see
the
story
girl
and
beverley
exchanging
winks
behind
her
back
it
certainly
is
though
some
people
were
so
opposed
to
starting
what
harmless
happy
fooling
it
all
was
how
we
laughed
as
we
read
and
listened
and
devoured
apples
blow
high
blow
low
no
wind
can
ever
quench
the
ruddy
glow
of
that
faraway
winter
night
in
our
memories
and
though
our
magazine
never
made
much
of
a
stir
in
the
world
or
was
the
means
of
hatching
any
genius
it
continued
to
be
capital
fun
for
us
throughout
the
year
chapter
vi
eliza
s
visit
it
was
a
diamond
winter
day
in
february
clear
cold
hard
brilliant
the
sharp
blue
sky
shone
the
white
fields
and
hills
glittered
the
fringe
of
icicles
around
the
eaves
of
uncle
alec
s
house
sparkled
keen
was
the
frost
and
crisp
the
snow
over
our
world
and
we
young
fry
of
the
king
households
were
all
agog
to
enjoy
life
for
was
it
not
saturday
and
were
we
not
left
all
alone
to
keep
house
aunt
janet
and
aunt
olivia
had
had
their
last
big
kill
of
market
poultry
the
day
before
and
early
in
the
morning
all
our
set
forth
to
charlottetown
to
be
gone
the
whole
day
they
left
us
many
charges
as
usual
some
of
which
we
remembered
and
some
of
which
we
forgot
but
with
felicity
in
command
none
of
us
dared
stray
far
out
of
line
the
story
girl
and
peter
came
over
of
course
and
we
all
agreed
that
we
would
haste
and
get
the
work
done
in
the
forenoon
that
we
might
have
an
afternoon
of
uninterrupted
enjoyment
a
after
dinner
and
then
a
jolly
hour
of
coasting
on
the
hill
field
before
supper
were
on
our
programme
but
disappointment
was
our
portion
we
did
manage
to
get
the
taffy
made
but
before
we
could
sample
the
result
satisfactorily
and
just
as
the
girls
were
finishing
with
the
washing
of
the
dishes
felicity
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
exclaimed
in
tones
of
dismay
oh
dear
me
here
s
eliza
coming
up
the
lane
now
isn
t
that
too
mean
we
all
looked
out
to
see
a
tall
lady
approaching
the
house
looking
about
her
with
the
slightly
puzzled
air
of
a
stranger
we
had
been
expecting
eliza
s
advent
for
some
weeks
for
she
was
visiting
relatives
in
markdale
we
knew
she
was
liable
to
pounce
down
on
us
any
time
being
one
of
those
delightful
folk
who
like
to
surprise
people
but
we
had
never
thought
of
her
coming
that
particular
day
it
must
be
confessed
that
we
did
not
look
forward
to
her
visit
with
any
pleasure
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
her
but
we
knew
she
was
very
deaf
and
had
very
decided
opinions
as
to
the
way
in
which
children
should
behave
whew
whistled
dan
we
re
in
for
a
jolly
afternoon
she
s
deaf
as
a
post
and
we
ll
have
to
split
our
throats
to
make
her
hear
at
all
i
ve
a
notion
to
skin
oh
don
t
talk
like
that
dan
said
cecily
reproachfully
she
s
old
and
lonely
and
has
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
she
has
buried
three
husbands
we
must
be
kind
to
her
and
do
the
best
we
can
to
make
her
visit
she
s
coming
to
the
back
door
said
felicity
with
an
agitated
glance
around
the
kitchen
i
told
you
dan
that
you
should
have
shovelled
the
snow
away
from
the
front
door
this
morning
cecily
set
those
pots
in
the
pantry
quick
hide
those
boots
felix
shut
the
cupboard
door
peter
sara
straighten
up
the
lounge
she
s
awfully
particular
and
ma
says
her
house
is
always
as
neat
as
to
do
felicity
justice
while
she
issued
orders
to
the
rest
of
us
she
was
flying
busily
about
herself
and
it
was
amazing
how
much
was
accomplished
in
the
way
of
putting
the
kitchen
in
perfect
order
during
the
two
minutes
in
which
eliza
was
crossing
the
yard
fortunately
the
is
tidy
and
there
s
plenty
in
the
pantry
said
felicity
who
could
face
anything
undauntedly
with
a
larder
behind
her
further
conversation
was
cut
short
by
a
decided
rap
at
the
door
felicity
opened
it
why
how
do
you
do
aunt
eliza
she
said
loudly
a
slightly
bewildered
look
appeared
on
aunt
eliza
s
face
felicity
perceived
she
had
not
spoken
loudly
enough
how
do
you
do
aunt
eliza
she
repeated
at
the
top
of
her
voice
come
in
we
are
glad
to
see
you
we
ve
been
looking
for
you
for
ever
so
are
your
father
and
mother
at
home
asked
aunt
eliza
slowly
no
they
went
to
town
today
but
they
ll
be
home
this
i
m
sorry
they
re
away
said
aunt
eliza
coming
in
because
i
can
stay
only
a
few
oh
that
s
too
bad
shouted
poor
felicity
darting
an
angry
glance
at
the
rest
of
us
as
if
to
demand
why
we
didn
t
help
her
out
why
we
ve
been
thinking
you
d
stay
a
week
with
us
anyway
you
must
stay
over
i
really
can
t
i
have
to
go
to
charlottetown
tonight
returned
aunt
eliza
well
you
ll
take
off
your
things
and
stay
to
tea
at
least
urged
felicity
as
hospitably
as
her
strained
vocal
chords
would
admit
yes
i
think
i
ll
do
that
i
want
to
get
acquainted
with
my
my
nephews
and
nieces
said
aunt
eliza
with
a
rather
pleasant
glance
around
our
group
if
i
could
have
associated
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
with
my
preconception
of
eliza
i
could
have
sworn
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
but
of
course
it
was
impossible
won
t
you
introduce
yourselves
please
felicity
shouted
our
names
and
eliza
shook
hands
all
round
she
performed
the
duty
grimly
and
i
concluded
i
must
have
been
mistaken
about
the
twinkle
she
was
certainly
very
tall
and
dignified
and
imposing
altogether
a
to
be
respected
felicity
and
cecily
took
her
to
the
spare
room
and
then
left
her
in
the
while
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
discuss
the
matter
in
family
conclave
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
dear
aunt
eliza
asked
dan
warned
cecily
with
a
glance
at
the
hall
door
pshaw
scoffed
dan
she
can
t
hear
us
there
ought
to
be
a
law
against
anyone
being
as
deaf
as
she
s
not
so
as
i
expected
said
felix
if
her
hair
wasn
t
so
white
she
wouldn
t
look
much
older
than
your
you
don
t
have
to
be
very
old
to
be
a
said
cecily
kitty
marr
has
a
who
is
just
the
same
age
as
her
mother
i
expect
it
was
burying
so
many
husbands
turned
her
hair
white
but
aunt
eliza
doesn
t
look
just
as
i
expected
she
would
she
s
dressed
more
stylishly
than
i
expected
said
felicity
i
thought
she
d
be
real
but
her
clothes
aren
t
too
bad
at
she
wouldn
t
be
if
tweren
t
for
her
nose
said
peter
it
s
too
long
and
crooked
you
needn
t
criticize
our
relations
like
that
said
felicity
tartly
well
aren
t
you
doing
it
yourselves
expostulated
peter
that
s
different
retorted
felicity
never
you
mind
eliza
s
well
don
t
expect
me
to
talk
to
her
said
dan
cause
i
won
i
m
going
to
be
very
polite
to
her
said
felicity
she
s
rich
but
how
are
we
to
entertain
her
that
s
the
what
does
the
family
guide
say
about
entertaining
your
rich
deaf
old
aunt
queried
dan
ironically
the
family
guide
says
we
should
be
polite
to
everybody
said
cecily
with
a
reproachful
look
at
dan
the
worst
of
it
is
said
felicity
looking
worried
that
there
isn
t
a
bit
of
old
bread
in
the
house
and
she
can
t
eat
new
i
ve
heard
father
say
it
gives
her
indigestion
what
will
we
do
make
a
pan
of
rusks
and
apologize
for
having
no
old
bread
suggested
the
story
girl
probably
by
way
of
teasing
felicity
the
latter
however
took
it
in
all
good
faith
the
family
guide
says
we
should
never
apologize
for
things
we
can
t
help
it
says
it
s
adding
insult
to
injury
to
do
it
but
you
run
over
home
for
a
loaf
of
stale
bread
sara
and
it
s
a
good
idea
about
the
rusks
i
ll
make
a
let
me
make
them
said
the
story
girl
eagerly
i
can
make
real
good
rusks
no
it
wouldn
t
do
to
trust
you
said
felicity
mercilessly
you
might
make
some
queer
mistake
and
aunt
eliza
would
tell
it
all
over
the
country
she
s
a
fearful
old
gossip
i
ll
make
the
rusks
myself
she
hates
cats
so
we
mustn
t
let
paddy
be
seen
and
she
s
a
methodist
so
mind
nobody
says
anything
against
methodists
to
who
s
going
to
say
anything
anyhow
asked
peter
belligerently
i
wonder
if
i
might
ask
her
for
her
name
for
my
quilt
square
speculated
cecily
i
believe
i
will
she
looks
so
much
friendlier
than
i
expected
of
course
she
ll
choose
the
section
she
s
an
estimable
old
lady
but
very
why
don
t
you
say
she
s
so
mean
she
d
skin
a
flea
for
its
hide
and
tallow
said
dan
that
s
the
plain
well
i
m
going
to
see
about
getting
tea
said
felicity
so
the
rest
of
you
will
have
to
entertain
her
you
better
go
in
and
show
her
the
photographs
in
the
album
dan
you
do
thank
you
that
s
a
girl
s
job
said
dan
i
d
look
nice
sitting
up
to
aunt
eliza
and
yelling
out
that
this
was
uncle
jim
and
tother
cousin
sarah
s
twins
wouldn
t
i
cecily
or
the
story
girl
can
do
i
don
t
know
all
the
pictures
in
your
album
said
the
story
girl
hastily
i
s
pose
i
ll
have
to
do
it
though
i
don
t
like
to
sighed
cecily
but
we
ought
to
go
in
we
ve
left
her
alone
too
long
now
she
ll
think
we
have
no
accordingly
we
all
filed
in
rather
reluctantly
eliza
was
toasting
her
toes
clad
as
we
noted
in
very
smart
and
shapely
shoes
at
the
stove
and
looking
quite
at
her
ease
cecily
determined
to
do
her
duty
even
in
the
face
of
such
fearful
odds
as
eliza
s
deafness
dragged
a
ponderous
album
from
its
corner
and
proceeded
to
display
and
explain
the
family
photographs
she
did
her
brave
best
but
she
could
not
shout
like
felicity
and
half
the
time
as
she
confided
to
me
later
on
she
felt
that
eliza
did
not
hear
one
word
she
said
because
she
didn
t
seem
to
take
in
who
the
people
were
though
just
like
all
deaf
folks
she
wouldn
t
let
on
eliza
certainly
didn
t
talk
much
she
looked
at
the
photographs
in
silence
but
she
smiled
now
and
then
that
smile
bothered
me
it
was
so
twinkly
and
so
very
but
i
felt
indignant
with
her
i
thought
she
might
have
shown
a
little
more
appreciation
of
cecily
s
gallant
efforts
to
entertain
it
was
very
dull
for
the
rest
of
us
the
story
girl
sat
rather
sulkily
in
her
corner
she
was
angry
because
felicity
would
not
let
her
make
the
rusks
and
also
perhaps
a
little
vexed
because
she
could
not
charm
eliza
with
her
golden
voice
and
gift
felix
and
i
looked
at
each
other
and
wished
ourselves
out
in
the
hill
field
careering
gloriously
adown
its
gleaming
crust
but
presently
a
little
amusement
came
our
way
dan
who
was
sitting
behind
eliza
and
consequently
out
of
her
view
began
making
comments
on
cecily
s
explanation
of
this
one
and
that
one
among
the
photographs
in
vain
cecily
implored
him
to
stop
it
was
too
good
fun
to
give
up
for
the
next
the
dialogue
ran
after
this
fashion
while
peter
and
felix
and
i
and
even
the
story
girl
suffered
agonies
trying
to
smother
our
bursts
of
laughter
for
eliza
could
see
if
she
couldn
t
hear
cecily
shouting
that
is
joseph
elliott
of
markdale
a
second
cousin
of
mother
dan
don
t
brag
of
it
sis
he
s
the
man
who
was
asked
if
somebody
else
said
something
in
sincerity
and
old
joe
said
no
he
said
it
in
my
cecily
this
isn
t
anybody
in
our
family
it
s
little
xavy
gautier
who
used
to
be
hired
with
uncle
dan
uncle
roger
sent
him
to
fix
a
gate
one
day
and
scolded
him
because
he
didn
t
do
it
right
and
xavy
was
mad
as
hops
and
said
how
you
spect
me
to
fix
dat
gate
i
never
learned
cecily
with
an
anguished
glance
at
dan
this
is
robert

he
s
been
married
four
times
don
t
you
think
that
s
often
enough

cecily

a
nephew
of
ambrose
marr
s
he
lives
out
west
and
teaches

uncle
roger

t
know
enough

in
a
field
with
the
gate
cecily
this
is
miss
julia
stanley
who
used
to
teach
in
carlisle
a
few
years

when
she
resigned
the
trustees

a
meeting
to
see
if
they
d
ask
her
to
stay
and
raise
her
supplement
old
highland
sandy
was
alive
then
and
he
got
up
and
said
if
she
for
go
let
her
for
went
perhaps
she
for
cecily
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
this
is
layton
who
used
to
travel
around
selling
bibles
and
hymn
books
and
talmage
s
dan
he
was
so
thin
uncle
roger
used
to
say
he
always
mistook
him
for
a
crack
in
the
atmosphere
one
time
he
stayed
here
all
night
and
went
to
prayer
meeting
and
marwood
asked
him
to
lead
in
prayer
it
had
been
raining
most
every
day
for
three
weeks
and
it
was
just
in
haymaking
time
and
everybody
thought
the
hay
was
going
to
be
ruined
and
old
layton
got
up
and
prayed
that
god
would
send
gentle
showers
on
the
growing
crops
and
i
heard
uncle
roger
whisper
to
a
fellow
behind
me
if
somebody
don
t
choke
him
off
we
won
t
get
the
hay
made
this
cecily
in
exasperation
dan
shame
on
you
for
telling
such
irreverent
stories
this
is
alexander
scott
of
markdale
she
has
been
very
sick
for
a
long
dan
uncle
roger
says
all
that
keeps
her
alive
is
that
she
s
scared
her
husband
will
marry
cecily
this
is
old
james
macpherson
who
used
to
live
behind
the
dan
he
s
the
man
who
told
mother
once
that
he
always
made
his
own
iodine
out
of
strong
tea
and
baking
cecily
this
is
cousin
ebenezer
macpherson
on
the
markdale
dan
great
temperance
man
he
never
tasted
rum
in
his
life
he
took
the
measles
when
he
was
and
was
crazy
as
a
loon
with
them
and
the
doctor
ordered
them
to
give
him
a
dose
of
brandy
when
he
swallowed
it
he
looked
up
and
says
solemn
as
an
owl
give
it
to
me
oftener
and
more
at
a
cecily
imploringly
dan
do
stop
you
make
me
so
nervous
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
doing
this
is
lemuel
goodridge
he
is
a
dan
you
ought
to
see
his
mouth
uncle
roger
says
the
drawing
string
has
fell
out
of
it
it
just
hangs
loose
so
dan
whose
own
mouth
was
far
from
being
beautiful
here
gave
an
imitation
of
the
rev
lemuel
s
to
the
utter
undoing
of
peter
felix
and
myself
our
wild
guffaws
of
laughter
penetrated
even
eliza
s
deafness
and
she
glanced
up
with
a
startled
face
what
we
would
have
done
i
do
not
know
had
not
felicity
at
that
moment
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
eyes
and
exclaimed
cecily
come
here
for
a
cecily
glad
of
even
a
temporary
respite
fled
to
the
kitchen
and
we
heard
her
demanding
what
was
the
matter
matter
exclaimed
felicity
tragically
matter
enough
some
of
you
left
a
soup
plate
with
molasses
in
it
on
the
pantry
table
and
pat
got
into
it
and
what
do
you
think
he
went
into
the
spare
room
and
walked
all
over
aunt
eliza
s
things
on
the
bed
you
can
see
his
tracks
plain
as
plain
what
in
the
world
can
we
do
she
ll
be
simply
i
looked
apprehensively
at
eliza
but
she
was
gazing
intently
at
a
picture
of
aunt
janet
s
sister
s
twins
a
most
stolid
uninteresting
pair
but
evidently
eliza
found
them
amusing
for
she
was
smiling
widely
over
them
let
us
take
a
little
clean
water
and
a
soft
bit
of
cotton
came
cecily
s
clear
voice
from
the
kitchen
and
see
if
we
can
t
clean
the
molasses
off
the
coat
and
hat
are
both
cloth
and
molasses
isn
t
like
well
we
can
try
but
i
wish
the
story
girl
would
keep
her
cat
home
grumbled
felicity
the
story
girl
here
flew
out
to
defend
her
pet
and
we
four
boys
sat
on
miserably
conscious
of
eliza
who
never
said
a
word
to
us
despite
her
previously
expressed
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
us
she
kept
on
looking
at
the
photographs
and
seemed
quite
oblivious
of
our
presence
presently
the
girls
returned
having
as
transpired
later
been
so
successful
in
removing
the
traces
of
paddy
s
mischief
that
it
was
not
deemed
necessary
to
worry
eliza
with
any
account
of
it
felicity
announced
tea
and
while
cecily
conveyed
eliza
out
to
the
lingered
behind
to
consult
with
us
for
a
moment
ought
we
to
ask
her
to
say
grace
she
wanted
to
know
i
know
a
story
said
the
story
girl
about
uncle
roger
when
he
was
just
a
young
man
he
went
to
the
house
of
a
very
deaf
old
lady
and
when
they
sat
down
to
the
table
she
asked
him
to
say
grace
uncle
roger
had
never
done
such
a
thing
in
his
life
and
he
turned
as
red
as
a
beet
and
looked
down
and
muttered
please
excuse
me
i
i
m
not
accustomed
to
doing
then
he
looked
up
and
the
old
lady
said
amen
loudly
and
cheerfully
she
thought
uncle
roger
was
saying
grace
all
the
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
to
tell
funny
stories
about
such
things
said
felicity
coldly
and
i
asked
for
your
opinion
not
for
a
if
we
don
t
ask
her
felix
must
say
it
for
he
s
the
only
one
who
can
and
we
must
have
it
or
she
d
be
oh
ask
her
ask
her
advised
felix
hastily
she
was
asked
accordingly
and
said
grace
without
any
hesitation
after
which
she
proceeded
to
eat
heartily
of
the
excellent
supper
felicity
had
provided
the
rusks
were
especially
good
and
eliza
ate
three
of
them
and
praised
them
apart
from
that
she
said
little
and
during
the
first
part
of
the
meal
we
sat
in
embarrassed
silence
towards
the
last
however
our
tongues
were
loosened
and
the
story
girl
told
us
a
tragic
tale
of
old
charlottetown
and
a
governor
s
wife
who
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
in
the
early
days
of
the
colony
they
say
that
story
isn
t
true
said
felicity
they
say
what
she
really
died
of
was
indigestion
the
governor
s
wife
who
lives
there
now
is
a
relation
of
our
own
she
is
a
second
cousin
of
father
s
but
we
ve
never
seen
her
her
name
was
agnes
clark
and
mind
you
when
father
was
a
young
man
he
was
dead
in
love
with
her
and
so
was
she
with
who
ever
told
you
that
exclaimed
dan
aunt
olivia
and
i
ve
heard
ma
teasing
father
about
it
too
of
course
it
was
before
father
got
acquainted
with
why
didn
t
your
father
marry
her
i
asked
well
she
just
simply
wouldn
t
marry
him
in
the
end
she
got
over
being
in
love
with
him
i
guess
she
was
pretty
fickle
aunt
olivia
said
father
felt
awful
about
it
for
awhile
but
he
got
over
it
when
he
met
ma
ma
was
twice
as
as
agnes
clark
agnes
was
a
sight
for
freckles
so
aunt
olivia
says
but
she
and
father
remained
real
good
friends
just
think
if
she
had
married
him
we
would
have
been
the
children
of
the
governor
s
but
she
wouldn
t
have
been
the
governor
s
wife
then
said
dan
i
guess
it
s
just
as
good
being
father
s
wife
declared
cecily
loyally
you
might
think
so
if
you
saw
the
governor
chuckled
dan
uncle
roger
says
it
would
be
no
harm
to
worship
him
because
he
doesn
t
look
like
anything
in
the
heavens
above
or
on
the
earth
beneath
or
the
waters
under
the
oh
uncle
roger
just
says
that
because
he
s
on
the
opposite
side
of
politics
said
cecily
the
governor
isn
t
really
so
very
ugly
i
saw
him
at
the
markdale
picnic
two
years
ago
he
s
very
fat
and
bald
and
but
i
ve
seen
far
worse
looking
i
m
afraid
your
seat
is
too
near
the
stove
aunt
eliza
shouted
felicity
our
guest
whose
face
was
certainly
very
much
flushed
shook
her
head
oh
no
i
m
very
comfortable
she
said
but
her
voice
had
the
effect
of
making
us
uncomfortable
there
was
a
queer
uncertain
little
sound
in
it
was
eliza
laughing
at
us
we
looked
at
her
sharply
but
her
face
was
very
solemn
only
her
eyes
had
a
suspicious
appearance
somehow
we
did
not
talk
much
more
the
rest
of
the
meal
when
it
was
over
eliza
said
she
was
very
sorry
but
she
must
really
go
felicity
politely
urged
her
to
stay
but
was
much
relieved
when
eliza
adhered
to
her
intention
of
going
when
felicity
took
her
to
the
spare
room
cecily
slipped
upstairs
and
presently
came
back
with
a
little
parcel
in
her
hand
what
have
you
got
there
demanded
felicity
suspiciously
a
a
little
bag
of
faltered
cecily
i
thought
i
d
give
them
to
aunt
the
idea
don
t
you
do
such
a
thing
said
felicity
contemptuously
she
d
think
you
were
she
was
awfully
nice
when
i
asked
her
for
her
name
for
the
quilt
protested
cecily
and
she
took
a
section
after
all
so
i
d
like
to
give
her
the
and
i
m
going
to
too
miss
eliza
accepted
the
little
gift
quite
graciously
bade
us
all
said
she
had
enjoyed
herself
very
much
left
messages
for
father
and
mother
and
finally
betook
herself
away
we
watched
her
cross
the
yard
tall
stately
erect
and
disappear
down
the
lane
then
as
often
aforetime
we
gathered
together
in
the
cheer
of
the
red
while
outside
the
wind
of
a
winter
twilight
sang
through
fair
white
valleys
brimmed
with
a
reddening
sunset
and
a
faint
serene
star
glimmered
over
the
willow
at
the
gate
well
said
felicity
drawing
a
relieved
breath
i
m
glad
she
s
gone
she
certainly
is
queer
just
as
mother
it
s
a
different
kind
of
queerness
from
what
i
expected
though
said
the
story
girl
meditatively
there
s
something
i
can
t
quite
make
out
about
aunt
eliza
i
don
t
think
i
altogether
like
i
m
precious
sure
i
don
t
said
dan
oh
well
never
mind
she
s
gone
now
and
that
s
the
last
of
it
said
cecily
comfortingly
but
it
wasn
t
the
last
of
it
not
by
any
manner
of
means
was
it
when
our
returned
almost
the
first
words
aunt
janet
said
were
and
so
you
had
the
governor
s
wife
to
tea
we
all
stared
at
her
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
said
felicity
we
had
nobody
to
tea
except
eliza
she
came
this
afternoon
and
eliza
nonsense
said
aunt
janet
aunt
eliza
was
in
town
today
she
had
tea
with
us
at
aunt
louisa
s
but
wasn
t
mrs
governor
lesley
here
we
met
her
on
her
way
back
to
charlottetown
and
she
told
us
she
was
she
said
she
was
visiting
a
friend
in
carlisle
and
thought
she
d
call
to
see
father
for
old
acquaintance
sake
what
in
the
world
are
all
you
children
staring
like
that
for
your
eyes
are
like
there
was
a
lady
here
to
tea
said
felicity
miserably
but
we
thought
it
was
eliza
she
never
said
she
wasn
t
i
thought
she
acted
queer
and
we
all
yelled
at
her
as
if
she
was
deaf
and
said
things
to
each
other
about
her
nose
and
pat
running
over
her
clothes
she
must
have
heard
all
you
said
while
i
was
showing
her
the
photographs
dan
cried
cecily
and
about
the
governor
at
tea
time
chuckled
unrepentant
dan
i
want
to
know
what
all
this
means
said
aunt
janet
sternly
she
knew
in
due
time
after
she
had
pieced
the
story
together
from
our
disjointed
accounts
she
was
horrified
and
uncle
alec
was
mildly
disturbed
but
uncle
roger
roared
with
laughter
and
aunt
olivia
echoed
it
to
think
you
should
have
so
little
sense
said
aunt
janet
in
a
disgusted
tone
i
think
it
was
real
mean
of
her
to
pretend
she
was
deaf
said
felicity
almost
on
the
verge
of
tears
that
was
agnes
clark
all
over
chuckled
uncle
roger
how
she
must
have
enjoyed
this
afternoon
she
had
enjoyed
it
as
we
learned
the
next
day
when
a
letter
came
from
her
dear
cecily
and
all
the
rest
of
you
wrote
the
governor
s
wife
i
want
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
pretending
to
be
aunt
eliza
i
suspect
it
was
a
little
horrid
of
me
but
really
i
couldn
t
resist
the
temptation
and
if
you
will
forgive
me
for
it
i
will
forgive
you
for
the
things
you
said
about
the
governor
and
we
will
all
be
good
friends
you
know
the
governor
is
a
very
nice
man
though
he
has
the
misfortune
not
to
be
handsome
i
had
just
a
splendid
time
at
your
place
and
i
envy
your
aunt
eliza
her
nephews
and
nieces
you
were
all
so
nice
to
me
and
i
didn
t
dare
to
be
a
bit
nice
to
you
lest
i
should
give
myself
away
but
i
ll
make
up
for
that
when
you
come
to
see
me
at
government
house
as
you
all
must
the
very
next
time
you
come
to
town
i
m
so
sorry
i
didn
t
see
paddy
for
i
love
pussy
cats
even
if
they
do
track
molasses
over
my
clothes
and
cecily
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
that
little
bag
of
it
smells
like
a
hundred
rose
gardens
and
i
have
put
it
between
the
sheets
for
my
very
sparest
room
bed
where
you
shall
sleep
when
you
come
to
see
me
you
dear
thing
and
the
governor
wants
you
to
put
his
name
on
the
quilt
square
too
in
the
section
tell
dan
i
enjoyed
his
comments
on
the
photographs
very
much
they
were
quite
a
refreshing
contrast
to
the
usual
explanations
of
who
s
and
felicity
your
rusks
were
perfection
do
send
me
your
recipe
for
them
there
s
a
darling
yours
most
cordially
agnes
clark
lesley
well
it
was
decent
of
her
to
apologize
anyhow
commented
dan
if
we
only
hadn
t
said
that
about
the
governor
moaned
felicity
how
did
you
make
your
rusks
asked
aunt
janet
there
was
no
in
the
house
and
i
never
could
get
them
right
with
soda
and
cream
of
there
was
plenty
of
in
the
pantry
said
felicity
no
there
wasn
t
a
particle
i
used
the
last
making
those
cookies
thursday
but
i
found
another
can
nearly
full
away
back
on
the
top
shelf
ma
the
one
with
the
yellow
label
i
guess
you
forgot
it
was
aunt
janet
stared
at
her
pretty
daughter
blankly
then
amazement
gave
place
to
horror
felicity
king
she
exclaimed
you
don
t
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
raised
those
rusks
with
the
stuff
that
was
in
that
old
yellow
can
yes
i
did
faltered
felicity
beginning
to
look
scared
why
ma
what
was
the
matter
with
it
matter
that
stuff
was
that
s
what
it
was
your
cousin
myra
broke
the
bottle
her
was
in
when
she
was
here
last
winter
and
i
gave
her
that
old
can
to
keep
it
in
she
forgot
to
take
it
when
she
went
away
and
i
put
it
on
that
top
shelf
i
declare
you
must
all
have
been
bewitched
poor
poor
felicity
if
she
had
not
always
been
so
horribly
vain
over
her
cooking
and
so
scornfully
contemptuous
of
other
people
s
aspirations
and
mistakes
along
that
line
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
her
the
story
girl
would
have
been
more
than
human
if
she
had
not
betrayed
a
little
triumphant
amusement
but
peter
stood
up
for
his
lady
manfully
the
rusks
were
splendid
anyhow
so
what
difference
does
it
make
what
they
were
raised
with
dan
however
began
to
taunt
felicity
with
her
rusks
and
kept
it
up
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
don
t
forget
to
send
the
governor
s
wife
the
recipe
for
them
he
said
felicity
with
eyes
tearful
and
cheeks
crimson
from
mortification
rushed
from
the
room
but
never
never
did
the
governor
s
wife
get
the
recipe
for
those
rusks
chapter
vii
we
visit
cousin
mattie
s
one
saturday
in
march
we
walked
over
to
baywater
for
a
visit
to
cousin
mattie
dilke
by
the
road
baywater
was
six
miles
away
but
there
was
a
short
cut
across
hills
and
fields
and
woods
which
was
scantly
three
we
did
not
look
forward
to
our
visit
with
any
particular
delight
for
there
was
nobody
at
cousin
mattie
s
except
who
had
been
grown
up
so
long
that
it
was
rather
hard
for
them
to
remember
they
had
ever
been
children
but
as
felicity
told
us
it
was
necessary
to
visit
cousin
mattie
at
least
once
a
year
or
else
she
would
be
huffed
so
we
concluded
we
might
as
well
go
and
have
it
over
anyhow
we
ll
get
a
splendiferous
dinner
said
dan
cousin
mattie
s
a
great
cook
and
there
s
nothing
stingy
about
you
are
always
thinking
of
your
stomach
said
felicity
pleasantly
well
you
know
i
couldn
t
get
along
very
well
without
it
darling
responded
dan
who
since
new
year
s
had
adopted
a
new
method
of
dealing
with
felicity
whether
by
way
of
keeping
his
resolution
or
because
he
had
discovered
that
it
annoyed
felicity
far
more
than
angry
retorts
deponent
sayeth
not
he
invariably
met
her
criticisms
with
a
grin
and
a
flippant
remark
with
some
tender
epithet
tagged
on
to
it
poor
felicity
used
to
get
hopelessly
furious
over
it
uncle
alec
was
dubious
about
our
going
that
day
he
looked
abroad
on
the
general
dourness
of
gray
earth
and
gray
air
and
gray
sky
and
said
a
storm
was
brewing
but
cousin
mattie
had
been
sent
word
that
we
were
coming
and
she
did
not
like
to
be
disappointed
so
he
let
us
go
warning
us
to
stay
with
cousin
mattie
all
night
if
the
storm
came
on
while
we
were
there
we
enjoyed
our
walk
even
felix
enjoyed
it
although
he
had
been
appointed
to
write
up
the
visit
for
our
magazine
and
was
rather
weighed
down
by
the
responsibility
of
it
what
mattered
it
though
the
world
were
gray
and
wintry
we
walked
the
golden
road
and
carried
spring
time
in
our
hearts
and
we
beguiled
our
way
with
laughter
and
jest
and
the
tales
the
story
girl
told
us
myths
and
legends
of
elder
time
the
walking
was
good
for
there
had
lately
been
a
thaw
and
everything
was
frozen
we
went
over
fields
crossed
by
spidery
trails
of
gray
fences
where
the
withered
grasses
stuck
forlornly
up
through
the
snow
we
lingered
for
a
time
in
a
group
of
hill
pines
great
majestic
friends
of
evening
stars
and
finally
struck
into
the
belt
of
fir
and
maple
which
intervened
between
carlisle
and
baywater
it
was
in
this
locality
that
peg
bowen
lived
and
our
way
lay
near
her
house
though
not
directly
in
sight
of
it
we
hoped
we
would
not
meet
her
for
since
the
affair
of
the
bewitchment
of
paddy
we
did
not
know
quite
what
to
think
of
peg
the
boldest
of
us
held
his
breath
as
we
passed
her
haunts
and
drew
it
again
with
a
sigh
of
relief
when
they
were
safely
left
behind
the
woods
were
full
of
the
brooding
stillness
that
often
precedes
a
storm
and
the
wind
crept
along
their
white
floors
with
a
low
wailing
cry
around
us
were
solitudes
of
snow
arcades
picked
out
in
pearl
and
silver
long
avenues
of
untrodden
marble
whence
sprang
the
cathedral
columns
of
the
firs
we
were
all
sorry
when
we
were
through
the
woods
and
found
ourselves
looking
down
into
the
snug
commonplace
settlement
of
baywater
there
s
cousin
mattie
s
house
that
big
white
one
at
the
turn
of
the
road
said
the
story
girl
i
hope
she
has
that
dinner
ready
dan
i
m
hungry
as
a
wolf
after
our
i
wish
cousin
mattie
s
husband
was
still
alive
said
dan
he
was
an
awful
nice
old
man
he
always
had
his
pockets
full
of
nuts
and
apples
i
used
to
like
going
there
better
when
he
was
alive
too
many
old
women
don
t
suit
oh
dan
cousin
mattie
and
her
are
just
as
nice
and
kind
as
they
can
be
reproached
cecily
oh
they
re
kind
enough
but
they
never
seem
to
see
that
a
fellow
gets
over
being
five
years
old
if
he
only
lives
long
enough
retorted
dan
i
know
a
story
about
cousin
mattie
s
husband
said
the
story
girl
his
name
was
ebenezer
you
know
is
it
any
wonder
he
was
thin
and
stunted
looking
said
dan
ebenezer
is
just
as
nice
a
name
as
daniel
said
felicity
do
you
really
think
so
my
angel
inquired
dan
in
tones
go
on
remember
your
second
resolution
i
whispered
to
the
story
girl
who
was
stalking
along
with
an
outraged
expression
the
story
girl
swallowed
something
and
went
on
cousin
ebenezer
had
a
horror
of
borrowing
he
thought
it
was
simply
a
dreadful
disgrace
to
borrow
anything
well
you
know
he
and
cousin
mattie
used
to
live
in
carlisle
where
the
rays
now
live
this
was
when
grandfather
king
was
alive
one
day
cousin
ebenezer
came
up
the
hill
and
into
the
kitchen
where
all
the
family
were
uncle
roger
said
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
stealing
sheep
he
sat
for
a
whole
hour
in
the
kitchen
and
hardly
spoke
a
word
but
just
looked
miserable
at
last
he
got
up
and
said
in
a
desperate
sort
of
way
uncle
abraham
can
i
speak
with
you
in
private
for
a
minute
oh
certainly
said
grandfather
and
took
him
into
the
parlour
cousin
ebenezer
shut
the
door
looked
all
around
him
and
then
said
imploringly
more
private
so
grandfather
took
him
into
the
spare
room
and
shut
that
door
he
was
getting
frightened
he
thought
something
terrible
must
have
happened
cousin
ebenezer
cousin
ebenezer
came
right
up
to
grandfather
took
hold
of
the
lapel
of
his
coat
and
said
in
a
whisper
uncle
abraham
can
you
lend
me
an
axe
he
needn
t
have
made
such
a
mystery
about
it
said
cecily
who
had
missed
the
point
entirely
and
couldn
t
see
why
the
rest
of
us
were
laughing
but
cecily
was
such
a
darling
that
we
did
not
mind
her
lack
of
a
sense
of
humour
it
s
kind
of
mean
to
tell
stories
like
that
about
people
who
are
dead
said
felicity
sometimes
it
s
safer
than
when
they
re
alive
though
sweetheart
commented
dan
we
had
our
expected
good
dinner
at
cousin
mattie
s
may
it
be
counted
unto
her
for
righteousness
she
and
her
miss
louisa
jane
and
miss
caroline
were
very
kind
to
us
we
had
quite
a
nice
time
although
i
understood
why
dan
objected
to
them
when
they
patted
us
all
on
the
head
and
told
us
whom
we
resembled
and
gave
us
peppermint
lozenges
chapter
viii
we
visit
peg
bowen
we
left
cousin
mattie
s
early
for
it
still
looked
like
a
storm
though
no
more
so
than
it
had
in
the
morning
we
intended
to
go
home
by
a
different
path
one
leading
through
cleared
land
overgrown
with
scrub
maple
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
farther
away
from
peg
bowen
s
house
we
hoped
to
be
home
before
it
began
to
storm
but
we
had
hardly
reached
the
hill
above
the
village
when
a
fine
driving
snow
began
to
fall
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
turned
back
even
then
but
we
had
already
come
a
mile
and
we
thought
we
would
have
ample
time
to
reach
home
before
it
became
really
bad
we
were
sadly
mistaken
by
the
time
we
had
gone
another
we
were
in
the
thick
of
a
bewildering
blinding
snowstorm
but
it
was
by
now
just
as
far
back
to
cousin
mattie
s
as
it
was
to
uncle
alec
s
so
we
struggled
on
growing
more
frightened
at
every
step
we
could
hardly
face
the
stinging
snow
and
we
could
not
see
ten
feet
ahead
of
us
it
had
turned
bitterly
cold
and
the
tempest
howled
all
around
us
in
white
desolation
under
the
night
the
narrow
path
we
were
trying
to
follow
soon
became
entirely
obliterated
and
we
stumbled
blindly
on
holding
to
each
other
and
trying
to
peer
through
the
furious
whirl
that
filled
the
air
our
plight
had
come
upon
us
so
suddenly
that
we
could
not
realize
it
presently
peter
who
was
leading
the
van
because
he
was
supposed
to
know
the
path
best
stopped
i
can
t
see
the
road
any
longer
he
shouted
i
don
t
know
where
we
we
all
stopped
and
huddled
together
in
a
miserable
group
fear
filled
our
hearts
it
seemed
ages
ago
that
we
had
been
snug
and
safe
and
warm
at
cousin
mattie
s
cecily
began
to
cry
with
cold
dan
in
spite
of
her
protests
dragged
off
his
overcoat
and
made
her
put
it
on
we
can
t
stay
here
he
said
we
ll
all
freeze
to
death
if
we
do
come
on
we
ve
got
to
keep
moving
the
snow
ain
t
so
deep
yet
take
hold
of
my
hand
cecily
we
must
all
hold
together
come
it
won
t
be
nice
to
be
frozen
to
death
but
if
we
get
through
alive
think
what
a
story
we
ll
have
to
tell
said
the
story
girl
between
her
chattering
teeth
in
my
heart
i
did
not
believe
we
would
ever
get
through
alive
it
was
almost
pitch
dark
now
and
the
snow
grew
deeper
every
moment
we
were
chilled
to
the
heart
i
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
lie
down
and
rest
but
i
remembered
hearing
that
that
was
fatal
and
i
endeavoured
to
stumble
on
with
the
others
it
was
wonderful
how
the
girls
kept
up
even
cecily
it
occurred
to
me
to
be
thankful
that
sara
ray
was
not
with
us
but
we
were
wholly
lost
now
all
around
us
was
a
horror
of
great
darkness
suddenly
felicity
fell
we
dragged
her
up
but
she
declared
she
could
not
go
on
she
was
done
out
have
you
any
idea
where
we
are
shouted
dan
to
peter
no
peter
shouted
back
the
wind
is
blowing
every
which
way
i
haven
t
any
idea
where
home
home
would
we
ever
see
it
again
we
tried
to
urge
felicity
on
but
she
only
repeated
drowsily
that
she
must
lie
down
and
rest
cecily
too
was
reeling
against
me
the
story
girl
still
stood
up
staunchly
and
counselled
struggling
on
but
she
was
numb
with
cold
and
her
words
were
hardly
distinguishable
some
wild
idea
was
in
my
mind
that
we
must
dig
a
hole
in
the
snow
and
all
creep
into
it
i
had
read
somewhere
that
people
had
thus
saved
their
lives
in
snowstorms
suddenly
felix
gave
a
shout
i
see
a
light
he
cried
where
where
we
all
looked
but
could
see
nothing
i
don
t
see
it
now
but
i
saw
it
a
moment
ago
shouted
felix
i
m
sure
i
did
come
on
over
in
this
inspired
with
fresh
hope
we
hurried
after
him
soon
we
all
saw
the
light
and
never
shone
a
fairer
beacon
a
few
more
steps
and
coming
into
the
shelter
of
the
woodland
on
the
further
side
we
realized
where
we
were
that
s
peg
bowen
s
house
exclaimed
peter
stopping
short
in
dismay
i
don
t
care
whose
house
it
is
declared
dan
we
ve
got
to
go
to
i
s
pose
so
acquiesced
peter
ruefully
we
can
t
freeze
to
death
even
if
she
is
a
for
goodness
sake
don
t
say
anything
about
witches
so
close
to
her
house
gasped
felicity
i
ll
be
thankful
to
get
in
we
reached
the
house
climbed
the
flight
of
steps
that
led
to
that
mysterious
second
story
door
and
dan
rapped
the
door
opened
promptly
and
peg
bowen
stood
before
us
in
what
seemed
exactly
the
same
costume
she
had
worn
on
the
memorable
day
when
we
had
come
bearing
gifts
to
propitiate
her
in
the
matter
of
paddy
behind
her
was
a
dim
room
scantly
illumined
by
the
one
small
candle
that
had
guided
us
through
the
storm
but
the
old
waterloo
stove
was
colouring
the
gloom
with
tremulous
whorls
of
light
and
warm
and
cosy
indeed
seemed
peg
s
retreat
to
us
benighted
wanderers
gracious
goodness
where
did
yez
all
come
from
exclaimed
peg
did
they
turn
yez
out
we
ve
been
over
to
baywater
and
we
got
lost
in
the
storm
coming
back
explained
dan
we
didn
t
know
where
we
were
till
we
saw
your
light
i
guess
we
ll
have
to
stay
here
till
the
storm
is
over
if
you
don
t
and
if
it
won
t
inconvenience
you
said
cecily
timidly
oh
it
s
no
inconvenience
to
speak
of
come
in
well
yez
have
got
some
snow
on
yez
let
me
get
a
broom
you
boys
stomp
your
feet
well
and
shake
your
coats
you
girls
give
me
your
things
and
i
ll
hang
them
up
guess
yez
are
most
froze
well
sit
up
to
the
stove
and
git
het
peg
bustled
away
to
gather
up
a
dubious
assortment
of
chairs
with
backs
and
rungs
missing
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
in
a
circle
around
her
roaring
stove
getting
dried
and
thawed
out
in
our
wildest
flights
of
fancy
we
had
never
pictured
ourselves
as
guests
at
the
witch
s
yet
here
we
were
and
the
witch
herself
was
actually
brewing
a
jorum
of
ginger
tea
for
cecily
who
continued
to
shiver
long
after
the
rest
of
us
were
roasted
to
the
marrow
poor
sis
drank
that
scalding
draught
being
in
too
great
awe
of
peg
to
do
aught
else
that
ll
soon
fix
your
shivers
said
our
hostess
kindly
and
now
i
ll
get
yez
all
some
oh
please
don
t
trouble
said
the
story
girl
hastily
tain
t
any
trouble
said
peg
briskly
then
with
one
of
the
sudden
changes
to
fierceness
which
made
her
such
a
terrifying
personage
do
yez
think
my
vittels
ain
t
clean
oh
no
no
cried
felicity
quickly
before
the
story
girl
could
speak
none
of
us
would
ever
think
that
sara
only
meant
she
didn
t
want
you
to
go
to
any
bother
on
our
it
ain
t
any
bother
said
peg
mollified
i
m
spry
as
a
cricket
this
winter
though
i
have
the
realagy
sometimes
many
a
good
bite
i
ve
had
in
your
ma
s
kitchen
i
owe
yez
a
no
more
protests
were
made
we
sat
in
awed
silence
gazing
with
timid
curiosity
about
the
room
the
stained
plastered
walls
of
which
were
covered
with
a
motley
assortment
of
pictures
chromos
and
advertisements
pasted
on
without
much
regard
for
order
or
character
we
had
heard
much
of
peg
s
pets
and
now
we
saw
them
six
cats
occupied
various
cosy
corners
one
of
them
the
black
goblin
which
had
so
terrified
us
in
the
summer
blinked
satirically
at
us
from
the
centre
of
peg
s
bed
another
a
dilapidated
striped
beastie
with
both
ears
and
one
eye
gone
glared
at
us
from
the
sofa
in
the
corner
a
dog
with
only
three
legs
lay
behind
the
stove
a
crow
sat
on
a
roost
above
our
heads
in
company
with
a
matronly
old
hen
and
on
the
clock
shelf
were
a
stuffed
monkey
and
a
grinning
skull
we
had
heard
that
a
sailor
had
given
peg
the
monkey
but
where
had
she
got
the
skull
and
whose
was
it
i
could
not
help
puzzling
over
these
gruesome
questions
presently
tea
was
ready
and
we
gathered
around
the
festal
board
a
board
literally
as
well
as
figuratively
for
peg
s
table
was
the
work
of
her
own
unskilled
hands
the
less
said
about
the
viands
of
that
meal
and
the
dishes
they
were
served
in
the
better
but
we
ate
them
bless
you
yes
as
we
would
have
eaten
any
witch
s
banquet
set
before
us
peg
might
or
might
not
be
a
witch
common
sense
said
not
but
we
knew
she
was
quite
capable
of
turning
every
one
of
us
out
of
doors
in
one
of
her
sudden
fierce
fits
if
we
offended
her
and
we
had
no
mind
to
trust
ourselves
again
to
that
wild
forest
where
we
had
fought
a
losing
fight
with
the
demon
forces
of
night
and
storm
but
it
was
not
an
agreeable
meal
in
more
ways
than
one
peg
was
not
at
all
careful
of
anybody
s
feelings
she
hurt
felix
s
cruelly
as
she
passed
him
his
cup
of
tea
you
ve
gone
too
much
to
flesh
boy
so
the
magic
seed
didn
t
work
hey
how
in
the
world
had
peg
found
out
about
that
magic
seed
felix
looked
uncommonly
foolish
if
you
d
come
to
me
in
the
first
place
i
d
soon
have
told
you
how
to
get
thin
said
peg
nodding
wisely
won
t
you
tell
me
now
asked
felix
eagerly
his
desire
to
melt
his
too
solid
flesh
overcoming
his
dread
and
shame
no
i
don
t
like
being
second
fiddle
answered
peg
with
a
crafty
smile
sara
you
re
too
scrawny
and
pale
not
much
like
your
ma
i
knew
her
well
she
was
counted
a
beauty
but
she
made
no
great
things
of
a
match
your
father
had
some
money
but
he
was
a
tramp
like
meself
where
is
he
now
in
rome
said
the
story
girl
rather
shortly
people
thought
your
ma
was
crazy
when
she
took
him
but
she
d
a
right
to
please
herself
folks
is
too
ready
to
call
other
folks
crazy
there
s
people
who
say
i
m
not
in
my
right
mind
did
yez
ever
peg
fixed
felicity
with
a
piercing
glance
hear
anything
so
ridiculous
never
said
felicity
white
to
the
lips
i
wish
everybody
was
as
sane
as
i
am
said
peg
scornfully
then
she
looked
poor
felicity
over
critically
you
re
but
proud
and
your
complexion
won
t
wear
it
ll
be
like
your
ma
s
yet
too
much
red
in
well
that
s
better
than
being
the
colour
of
mud
muttered
peter
who
wasn
t
going
to
hear
his
lady
traduced
even
by
a
witch
all
the
thanks
he
got
was
a
furious
look
from
felicity
but
peg
had
not
heard
him
and
now
she
turned
her
attention
to
cecily
you
look
delicate
i
daresay
you
ll
never
live
to
grow
cecily
s
lip
trembled
and
dan
s
face
turned
crimson
shut
up
he
said
to
peg
you
ve
no
business
to
say
such
things
to
i
think
my
jaw
dropped
i
know
peter
s
and
felix
s
did
felicity
broke
in
wildly
oh
don
t
mind
him
miss
bowen
he
s
got
such
a
temper
that
s
just
the
way
he
talks
to
us
all
at
home
please
excuse
bless
you
i
don
t
mind
him
said
peg
from
whom
the
unexpected
seemed
to
be
the
thing
to
expect
i
like
a
lad
of
spurrit
and
so
your
father
run
away
did
he
peter
he
used
to
be
a
beau
of
mine
he
seen
me
home
three
times
from
singing
school
when
we
was
young
some
folks
said
he
did
it
for
a
dare
there
s
such
a
lot
of
jealousy
in
the
world
ain
t
there
do
you
know
where
he
is
now
no
said
peter
well
he
s
coming
home
before
long
said
peg
mysteriously
who
told
you
that
cried
peter
in
amazement
better
not
ask
responded
peg
looking
up
at
the
skull
if
she
meant
to
make
the
flesh
creep
on
our
bones
she
succeeded
but
now
much
to
our
relief
the
meal
was
over
and
peg
invited
us
to
draw
our
chairs
up
to
the
stove
again
make
yourselves
at
home
she
said
producing
her
pipe
from
her
pocket
i
ain
t
one
of
the
kind
who
thinks
their
houses
too
good
to
live
in
guess
i
won
t
bother
washing
the
dishes
they
ll
do
yez
for
breakfast
if
yez
don
t
forget
your
places
i
s
pose
none
of
yez
no
said
felicity
rather
primly
then
yez
don
t
know
what
s
good
for
yez
retorted
peg
rather
grumpily
but
a
few
whiffs
of
her
pipe
placated
her
and
observing
cecily
sigh
she
asked
her
kindly
what
was
the
matter
i
m
thinking
how
worried
they
ll
be
at
home
about
us
explained
cecily
bless
you
dearie
don
t
be
worrying
over
that
i
ll
send
them
word
that
yez
are
all
snug
and
safe
but
how
can
you
cried
amazed
cecily
better
not
ask
said
peg
again
with
another
glance
at
the
skull
an
uncomfortable
silence
followed
finally
broken
by
peg
who
introduced
her
pets
to
us
and
told
how
she
had
come
by
them
the
black
cat
was
her
favourite
that
cat
knows
more
than
i
do
if
yez
ll
believe
it
she
said
proudly
i
ve
got
a
rat
too
but
he
s
a
bit
shy
when
strangers
is
round
your
cat
got
all
right
again
that
time
didn
t
he
yes
said
the
story
girl
thought
he
would
said
peg
nodding
sagely
i
seen
to
that
now
don
t
yez
all
be
staring
at
the
hole
in
my
we
weren
t
was
our
chorus
of
protest
looked
as
if
yez
were
i
tore
that
yesterday
but
i
didn
t
mend
it
i
was
brought
up
to
believe
that
a
hole
was
an
accident
but
a
patch
was
a
disgrace
and
so
your
aunt
olivia
is
going
to
be
married
after
all
this
was
news
to
us
we
felt
and
looked
dazed
i
never
heard
anything
of
it
said
the
story
girl
oh
it
s
true
enough
she
s
a
great
fool
i
ve
no
faith
in
husbands
but
one
good
thing
is
she
ain
t
going
to
marry
that
henry
jacobs
of
markdale
he
wants
her
bad
enough
just
like
his
presumption
thinking
himself
good
enough
for
a
king
his
father
is
the
worst
man
alive
he
chased
me
off
his
place
with
his
dog
once
but
i
ll
get
even
with
him
peg
looked
very
savage
and
visions
of
burned
barns
floated
through
our
minds
he
ll
be
punished
in
hell
you
know
said
peter
timidly
but
i
won
t
be
there
to
see
that
rejoined
peg
some
folks
say
i
ll
go
there
because
i
don
t
go
to
church
oftener
but
i
don
t
believe
why
don
t
you
go
asked
peter
with
a
temerity
that
bordered
on
rashness
well
i
ve
got
so
sunburned
i
m
afraid
folks
might
take
me
for
an
injun
explained
peg
quite
seriously
besides
your
minister
makes
such
awful
long
prayers
why
does
he
do
it
i
suppose
he
finds
it
easier
to
talk
to
god
than
to
people
suggested
peter
reflectively
well
anyway
i
belong
to
the
round
church
said
peg
comfortably
and
so
the
devil
can
t
catch
me
at
the
corners
i
haven
t
been
to
carlisle
church
for
over
three
years
i
thought
i
d
laughing
the
last
time
i
was
there
old
elder
marr
took
up
the
collection
that
day
he
d
on
a
pair
of
new
boots
and
they
squeaked
all
the
way
up
and
down
the
aisles
and
every
time
the
boots
squeaked
the
elder
made
a
face
like
he
had
toothache
it
was
awful
funny
how
s
your
missionary
quilt
coming
on
cecily
was
there
anything
peg
didn
t
know
very
well
said
cecily
you
can
put
my
name
on
it
if
you
want
oh
thank
you
which
section
the
one
or
the
one
asked
cecily
timidly
the
one
of
course
the
best
is
none
too
good
for
me
i
ll
give
you
the
ten
cents
another
time
i
m
short
of
change
just
now
not
being
as
rich
as
queen
victory
there
s
her
picture
up
there
the
one
with
the
blue
sash
and
diamint
crown
and
the
lace
curting
on
her
head
can
any
of
yez
tell
me
this
is
queen
victory
a
married
woman
oh
yes
but
her
husband
is
dead
answered
the
story
girl
well
i
s
pose
they
couldn
t
have
called
her
an
old
maid
seeing
she
was
a
queen
even
if
she
d
never
got
married
sometimes
i
sez
to
myself
peg
would
you
like
to
be
queen
victory
but
i
never
know
what
to
answer
in
summer
when
i
can
roam
anywhere
in
the
woods
and
the
sunshine
i
wouldn
t
be
queen
victory
for
anything
but
when
it
s
winter
and
cold
and
i
can
t
git
nowheres
i
feel
as
if
i
wouldn
t
mind
changing
places
with
peg
put
her
pipe
back
in
her
mouth
and
began
to
smoke
fiercely
the
candle
wick
burned
long
and
was
topped
by
a
little
cap
of
fiery
red
that
seemed
to
wink
at
us
like
an
impish
gnome
the
most
grotesque
shadow
of
peg
flickered
over
the
wall
behind
her
the
cat
remitted
his
grim
watch
and
went
to
sleep
outside
the
wind
screamed
like
a
ravening
beast
at
the
window
suddenly
peg
removed
her
pipe
from
her
mouth
bent
forward
gripped
my
wrist
with
her
sinewy
fingers
until
i
almost
cried
out
with
pain
and
gazed
straight
into
my
face
i
felt
horribly
frightened
of
her
she
seemed
an
entirely
different
creature
a
wild
light
was
in
her
eyes
a
furtive
expression
was
on
her
face
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
different
voice
and
in
different
language
do
you
hear
the
wind
she
asked
in
a
thrilling
whisper
what
is
the
wind
what
is
the
wind
i
i
don
t
know
i
stammered
no
more
do
i
said
peg
and
nobody
knows
nobody
knows
what
the
wind
is
i
wish
i
could
find
out
i
mightn
t
be
so
afraid
of
the
wind
if
i
knew
what
it
was
i
am
afraid
of
it
when
the
blasts
come
like
that
i
want
to
crouch
down
and
hide
me
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
about
the
wind
it
s
the
only
free
thing
in
the
world
the
only
free
thing
everything
else
is
subject
to
some
law
but
the
wind
is
free
it
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
no
man
can
tame
it
it
s
free
that
s
why
i
love
it
though
i
m
afraid
of
it
it
s
a
grand
thing
to
be
free
free
free
free
peg
s
voice
rose
almost
to
a
shriek
we
were
dreadfully
frightened
for
we
knew
there
were
times
when
she
was
quite
crazy
and
we
feared
one
of
her
spells
was
coming
on
her
but
with
a
swift
movement
she
turned
the
man
s
coat
she
wore
up
over
her
shoulders
and
head
like
a
hood
completely
hiding
her
face
then
she
crouched
forward
elbows
on
knees
and
relapsed
into
silence
none
of
us
dared
speak
or
move
we
sat
thus
for
half
an
hour
then
peg
jumped
up
and
said
briskly
in
her
usual
tone
well
i
guess
yez
are
all
sleepy
and
ready
for
bed
you
girls
can
sleep
in
my
bed
over
there
and
i
ll
take
the
sofy
yez
can
put
the
cat
off
if
yez
like
though
he
won
t
hurt
yez
you
boys
can
go
downstairs
there
s
a
big
pile
of
straw
there
that
ll
do
yez
for
a
bed
if
yez
put
your
coats
on
i
ll
light
yez
down
but
i
ain
t
going
to
leave
yez
a
light
for
fear
yez
d
set
fire
to
the
saying
to
the
girls
who
looked
as
if
they
thought
their
last
hour
was
come
we
went
to
the
lower
room
it
was
quite
empty
save
for
a
pile
of
fire
wood
and
another
of
clean
straw
casting
a
stealthy
glance
around
ere
peg
withdrew
the
light
i
was
relieved
to
see
that
there
were
no
skulls
in
sight
we
four
boys
snuggled
down
in
the
straw
we
did
not
expect
to
sleep
but
we
were
very
tired
and
before
we
knew
it
our
eyes
were
shut
to
open
no
more
till
morning
the
poor
girls
were
not
so
fortunate
they
always
averred
they
never
closed
an
eye
four
things
prevented
them
from
sleeping
in
the
first
place
peg
snored
loudly
in
the
second
place
the
fitful
gleams
of
firelight
kept
flickering
over
the
skull
for
half
the
night
and
making
gruesome
effects
on
it
in
the
third
place
peg
s
pillows
and
bedclothes
smelled
rankly
of
tobacco
smoke
and
in
the
fourth
place
they
were
afraid
the
rat
peg
had
spoken
of
might
come
out
to
make
their
acquaintance
indeed
they
were
sure
they
heard
him
skirmishing
about
several
times
when
we
wakened
in
the
morning
the
storm
was
over
and
a
young
morning
was
looking
through
rosy
eyelids
across
a
white
world
the
little
clearing
around
peg
s
cabin
was
heaped
with
dazzling
drifts
and
we
boys
fell
to
and
shovelled
out
a
road
to
her
well
she
gave
us
breakfast
stiff
oatmeal
porridge
without
milk
and
a
boiled
egg
apiece
cecily
could
not
eat
her
porridge
she
declared
she
had
such
a
bad
cold
that
she
had
no
appetite
a
cold
she
certainly
had
the
rest
of
us
choked
our
messes
down
and
after
we
had
done
so
peg
asked
us
if
we
had
noticed
a
soapy
taste
the
soap
fell
into
the
porridge
while
i
was
making
it
she
said
but
smacking
her
lips
i
m
going
to
make
yez
an
irish
stew
for
dinner
it
ll
be
an
irish
stew
concocted
by
peg
no
wonder
dan
said
hastily
you
are
very
kind
but
we
ll
have
to
go
right
yez
can
t
walk
said
peg
oh
yes
we
can
the
drifts
are
so
hard
they
ll
carry
and
the
snow
will
be
pretty
well
blown
off
the
middle
of
the
fields
it
s
only
of
a
mile
we
boys
will
go
home
and
get
a
pung
and
come
back
for
you
but
the
girls
wouldn
t
listen
to
this
they
must
go
with
us
even
cecily
seems
to
me
yez
weren
t
in
such
a
hurry
to
leave
last
night
observed
peg
sarcastically
oh
it
s
only
because
they
ll
be
so
anxious
about
us
at
home
and
it
s
sunday
and
we
don
t
want
to
miss
sunday
school
explained
felicity
well
i
hope
your
sunday
school
will
do
yez
good
said
peg
rather
grumpily
but
she
relented
again
at
the
last
and
gave
cecily
a
wishbone
whatever
you
wish
on
that
will
come
true
she
said
but
you
only
have
the
one
wish
so
don
t
waste
we
re
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
your
trouble
said
the
story
girl
politely
never
mind
the
trouble
the
expense
is
the
thing
retorted
peg
grimly
oh
felicity
hesitated
if
you
would
let
us
pay
you
give
you
something
no
thank
yez
responded
peg
loftily
there
is
people
who
take
money
for
their
hospitality
i
ve
heerd
but
i
m
thankful
to
say
i
don
t
associate
with
that
class
yez
are
welcome
to
all
yez
have
had
here
if
yez
are
in
a
big
hurry
to
get
she
shut
the
door
behind
us
with
something
of
a
slam
and
her
black
cat
followed
us
so
far
with
stealthy
furtive
footsteps
that
we
were
frightened
of
it
eventually
it
turned
back
then
and
not
till
then
did
we
feel
free
to
discuss
our
adventure
well
i
m
thankful
we
re
out
of
that
said
felicity
drawing
a
long
breath
hasn
t
it
just
been
an
awful
experience
we
might
all
have
been
found
frozen
stark
and
stiff
this
morning
remarked
the
story
girl
with
apparent
relish
i
tell
you
it
was
a
lucky
thing
we
got
to
peg
bowen
s
said
dan
miss
marwood
says
there
is
no
such
thing
as
luck
protested
cecily
we
ought
to
say
it
was
providence
well
peg
and
providence
don
t
seem
to
go
together
very
well
somehow
retorted
dan
if
peg
is
a
witch
it
must
be
the
other
one
she
s
in
dan
it
s
getting
to
be
simply
scandalous
the
way
you
talk
said
felicity
i
just
wish
ma
could
hear
is
soap
in
porridge
any
worse
than
in
rusks
lovely
creature
asked
dan
dan
dan
admonished
cecily
between
her
coughs
remember
it
s
it
seems
hard
to
remember
that
said
peter
it
doesn
t
seem
a
mite
like
sunday
and
it
seems
awful
long
since
cecily
you
ve
got
a
dreadful
cold
said
the
story
girl
anxiously
in
spite
of
peg
s
ginger
tea
added
felix
oh
that
ginger
tea
was
awful
exclaimed
poor
cecily
i
thought
i
d
never
get
it
down
it
was
so
hot
with
ginger
and
there
was
so
much
of
it
but
i
was
so
frightened
of
offending
peg
i
d
have
tried
to
drink
it
all
if
there
had
been
a
bucketful
oh
yes
it
s
very
easy
for
you
all
to
laugh
you
didn
t
have
to
drink
we
had
to
eat
two
meals
though
said
felicity
with
a
shiver
and
i
don
t
know
when
those
dishes
of
hers
were
washed
i
just
shut
my
eyes
and
took
did
you
notice
the
soapy
taste
in
the
porridge
asked
the
story
girl
oh
there
were
so
many
queer
tastes
about
it
i
didn
t
notice
one
more
than
another
answered
felicity
wearily
what
bothers
me
remarked
peter
absently
is
that
skull
do
you
suppose
peg
really
finds
things
out
by
it
nonsense
how
could
she
scoffed
felix
bold
as
a
lion
in
daylight
she
didn
t
say
she
did
you
know
i
said
cautiously
well
we
ll
know
in
time
if
the
things
she
said
were
going
to
happen
do
mused
peter
do
you
suppose
your
father
is
really
coming
home
queried
felicity
i
hope
not
answered
peter
decidedly
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
felicity
severely
no
i
oughtn
t
father
got
drunk
all
the
time
he
was
home
and
wouldn
t
work
and
was
bad
to
mother
said
peter
defiantly
she
had
to
support
him
as
well
as
herself
and
me
i
don
t
want
to
see
any
father
coming
home
and
you
d
better
believe
it
of
course
if
he
was
the
right
sort
of
a
father
it
d
be
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
if
aunt
olivia
is
going
to
be
married
said
the
story
girl
absently
i
can
hardly
believe
it
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
uncle
roger
has
been
teasing
her
ever
since
she
was
in
halifax
last
if
she
does
get
married
you
ll
have
to
come
and
live
with
us
said
cecily
delightedly
felicity
did
not
betray
so
much
delight
and
the
story
girl
remarked
with
a
weary
little
sigh
that
she
hoped
aunt
olivia
wouldn
t
we
all
felt
rather
weary
somehow
peg
s
predictions
had
been
unsettling
and
our
nerves
had
all
been
more
or
less
strained
during
our
sojourn
under
her
roof
we
were
glad
when
we
found
ourselves
at
home
the
folks
had
not
been
at
all
troubled
about
us
but
it
was
because
they
were
sure
the
storm
had
come
up
before
we
would
think
of
leaving
cousin
mattie
s
and
not
because
they
had
received
any
mysterious
message
from
peg
s
skull
we
were
relieved
at
this
but
on
the
whole
our
adventure
had
not
done
much
towards
clearing
up
the
vexed
question
of
peg

witchcraft

the
editor
wishes
to
make
a
few
remarks
about
the
resolution
honour
roll
as
will
be
seen
only
one
name
figures
on
it
felicity
says
she
has
thought
a
beautiful
thought
every
morning
before
breakfast
without
missing
one
morning
not
even
the
one
we
were
at
peg
bowen
s
some
of
our
number
think
it
not
fair
that
felicity
should
be
on
the
honour
roll
felicity
aside
that
s
dan
of
when
she
only
made
one
resolution
and
won
t
tell
us
what
any
of
the
thoughts
were
so
we
have
decided
to
give
honourable
mention
to
everybody
who
has
kept
one
resolution
perfect
felix
has
worked
all
his
arithmetic
problems
by
himself
he
complains
that
he
never
got
more
than
a
third
of
them
right
and
the
teacher
has
marked
him
away
down
but
one
can
not
keep
resolutions
without
some
inconvenience
peter
has
never
played
in
church
or
got
drunk
and
says
it
wasn
t
as
bad
as
he
expected
peter
indignantly
i
never
said
cecily
soothingly
now
peter
bev
only
meant
that
as
a
sara
ray
has
never
talked
any
mean
gossip
but
does
not
find
conversation
as
interesting
as
it
used
to
be
sara
ray
wonderingly
i
don
t
remember
of
saying
felix
did
not
eat
any
apples
until
march
but
forgot
and
ate
seven
the
day
we
were
at
cousin
mattie
s
felix
i
only
ate
five
he
soon
gave
up
trying
to
say
what
he
thought
always
he
got
into
too
much
trouble
we
think
felix
ought
to
change
to
old
grandfather
king
s
rule
it
was
hold
your
tongue
when
you
can
and
when
you
can
t
tell
the
cecily
feels
she
has
not
read
all
the
good
books
she
might
because
some
she
tried
to
read
were
very
dull
and
the
pansy
books
were
so
much
more
interesting
and
it
is
no
use
trying
not
to
feel
bad
because
her
hair
isn
t
curly
and
she
has
marked
that
resolution
out
the
story
girl
came
very
near
to
keeping
her
resolution
to
have
all
the
good
times
possible
but
she
says
she
missed
two
if
not
three
she
might
have
had
dan
refuses
to
say
anything
about
his
resolutions
and
so
does
the
editor
personals
we
regret
that
miss
cecily
king
is
suffering
from
a
severe
cold
alexander
marr
of
markdale
died
very
suddenly
last
week
we
never
heard
of
his
death
till
he
was
dead
miss
cecily
king
wishes
to
state
that
she
did
not
ask
the
question
about
holy
moses
and
the
other
word
in
the
january
number
dan
put
it
in
for
a
mean
joke
the
weather
has
been
cold
and
fine
we
have
only
had
one
bad
storm
the
coasting
on
uncle
roger

hill

good
aunt
eliza
did
not
favour
us
with
a
visit
after
all
she
took
cold
and
had
to
go
home
we
were
sorry
that
she
had
a
cold
but
glad
that
she
had
to
go
home
cecily
said
she
thought
it
wicked
of
us
to
be
glad
but
when
we
asked
her
cross
her
heart
if
she
wasn
t
glad
herself
she
had
to
say
she
was

on
february
the
seventeenth

are
all
invited
to

some
of
us
think
we
won
t
go
a
tragic
event
occurred
last
tuesday
james
frewen
came
to
tea
and
there
was
no
pie
in

descriptions

in

column
felix
wrote
one
but
the
girls
thought
he
did
not
do
her
justice
so
cecily
wrote
another
one
she
admits
she
copied
most
of
the
description
out
of

marmaduke

last

not

cecily

an
account
of
our
visit
to
cousin
mattie
s
we
all
walked
over
to
cousin
mattie
s
last
week
they
were
all
well
there
and
we
had
a
fine
dinner
on
our
way
back
a
came
up
and
we
got
lost
in
the
woods
we
didn
t
know
where
we
were
or
nothing
if
we
hadn
t
seen
a
light
i
guess
we
d
all
have
been
frozen
and
snowed
over
and
they
would
never
have
found
us
till
spring
and
that
would
be
very
sad
but
we
saw
a
light
and
made
for
it
and
it
was
peg
bowen
s
some
people
think
she
is
a
witch
and
it
s
hard
to
tell
but
she
was
real
hospitable
and
took
us
all
in
her
house
was
very
untidy
but
it
was
warm
she
has
a
skull
i
mean
a
loose
skull
not
her
own
she
lets
on
it
tells
her
things
but
uncle
alec
says
it
couldn
t
because
it
was
only
an
indian
skull
that
old
beecham
had
and
peg
stole
it
when
he
died
but
uncle
roger
says
he
wouldn
t
trust
himself
with
peg
s
skull
for
anything
she
gave
us
supper
it
was
a
horrid
meal
the
story
girl
says
i
must
not
tell
what
i
found
in
the
bread
and
butter
because
it
would
be
too
disgusting
to
read
in
our
magazine
but
it
don
t
matter
because
we
were
all
there
except
sara
ray
and
know
what
it
was
we
stayed
all
night
and
us
boys
slept
in
straw
none
of
us
had
ever
slept
on
straw
before
we
got
home
in
the
morning
that
is
all
i
can
write
about
our
visit
to
cousin
mattie
s
felix
king
my
worst
adventure
it
s
my
turn
to
write
it
so
i
suppose
i
must
i
guess
my
worst
adventure
was
two
years
ago
when
a
whole
lot
of
us
were
coasting
on
uncle
rogers
hill
charlie
cowan
and
fred
marr
had
started
but
down
their
sled
got
stuck
and
i
run
down
to
shove
them
off
again
then
i
stood
there
just
a
moment
to
watch
them
with
my
back
to
the
top
of
the
hill
while
i
was
standing
there
rob
marr
started
kitty
and
em
frewen
off
on
his
sled
his
sled
had
a
wooden
tongue
in
it
and
it
slanted
back
over
the
girls
heads
i
was
right
in
the
way
and
they
yelled
to
me
to
get
out
but
just
as
i
heard
them
it
struck
me
the
sled
took
me
between
the
legs
and
i
was
histed
back
over
the
tongue
and
dropped
in
a
heap
behind
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
to
me
i
thought
a
tornado
had
struck
me
the
girls
couldn
t
stop
though
they
thought
i
was
killed
but
rob
came
tearing
down
and
helped
me
up
he
was
awful
scared
but
i
wasn
t
killed
nor
my
back
wasn
t
broken
but
my
nose
bled
something
awful
and
kept
on
bleeding
for
three
days
not
all
the
time
but
by
spells
dan
king
the
story
of
how
carlisle
got
its
name
this
is
a
true
story
to
long
ago
there
was
a
girl
lived
in
charlotte
town
i
dont
know
her
name
so
i
cant
right
it
and
maybe
it
is
just
as
well
for
felicity
might
think
it
wasnt
romantik
like
miss
jemima
parrs
she
was
awful
pretty
and
a
young
englishman
who
had
come
out
to
make
his
fortune
fell
in
love
with
her
and
they
were
engaged
to
be
married
the
next
spring
his
name
was
carlisle
in
the
winter
he
started
off
to
hunt
cariboo
for
a
spell
cariboos
lived
on
the
island
then
there
aint
any
here
now
he
got
to
where
it
is
carlisle
now
it
wasn
t
anything
then
only
woods
and
a
few
indians
he
got
awful
sick
and
was
sick
for
ever
so
long
in
a
indian
camp
and
only
an
old
micmac
squaw
to
wait
on
him
back
in
town
they
all
thought
he
was
dead
and
his
girl
felt
bad
for
a
little
while
and
then
got
over
it
and
took
up
with
another
beau
the
girls
say
that
wasnt
romantik
but
i
think
it
was
sensible
but
if
it
had
been
me
that
died
i
d
have
felt
bad
if
she
forgot
me
so
soon
but
he
hadnt
died
and
when
he
got
back
to
town
he
went
right
to
her
house
and
walked
in
and
there
she
was
standing
up
to
be
married
to
the
other
fellow
poor
carlisle
felt
awful
he
was
sick
and
week
and
it
went
to
his
head
he
just
turned
and
run
and
run
till
he
got
back
to
the
old
micmac
s
camp
and
fell
in
front
of
it
but
the
indians
had
gone
because
it
was
spring
and
it
didnt
matter
because
he
really
was
dead
this
time
and
people
come
looking
for
him
from
town
and
found
him
and
buryed
him
there
and
called
the
place
after
him
they
say
the
girl
was
never
happy
again
and
that
was
hard
lines
on
her
but
maybe
she
deserved
it

chapter
x
disappearance
of
paddy
as
i
remember
the
spring
came
late
that
year
in
carlisle
it
was
may
before
the
weather
began
to
satisfy
the
but
we
children
were
more
easily
pleased
and
we
thought
april
a
splendid
month
because
the
snow
all
went
early
and
left
gray
firm
frozen
ground
for
our
rambles
and
games
as
the
days
slipped
by
they
grew
more
gracious
the
hillsides
began
to
look
as
if
they
were
thinking
of
mayflowers
the
old
orchard
was
washed
in
a
bath
of
tingling
sunshine
and
the
sap
stirred
in
the
big
trees
by
day
the
sky
was
veiled
with
delicate
cloud
drift
fine
and
filmy
as
woven
mist
in
the
evenings
a
full
low
moon
looked
over
the
valleys
as
pallid
and
holy
as
some
aureoled
saint
a
sound
of
laughter
and
dream
was
on
the
wind
and
the
world
grew
young
with
the
mirth
of
april
breezes
it
s
so
nice
to
be
alive
in
the
spring
said
the
story
girl
one
twilight
as
we
swung
on
the
boughs
of
uncle
stephen
s
walk
it
s
nice
to
be
alive
any
time
said
felicity
complacently
but
it
s
nicer
in
the
spring
insisted
the
story
girl
when
i
m
dead
i
think
i
ll
feel
dead
all
the
rest
of
the
year
but
when
spring
comes
i
m
sure
i
ll
feel
like
getting
up
and
being
alive
you
do
say
such
queer
things
complained
felicity
you
won
t
be
really
dead
any
time
you
ll
be
in
the
next
world
and
i
think
it
s
horrid
to
talk
about
people
being
dead
we
ve
all
got
to
die
said
sara
ray
solemnly
but
with
a
certain
relish
it
was
as
if
she
enjoyed
looking
forward
to
something
in
which
nothing
neither
an
unsympathetic
mother
nor
the
cruel
fate
which
had
made
her
a
colourless
little
nonentity
could
prevent
her
from
being
the
chief
performer
i
sometimes
think
said
cecily
rather
wearily
that
it
isn
t
so
dreadful
to
die
young
as
i
used
to
she
prefaced
her
remark
with
a
slight
cough
as
she
had
been
all
too
apt
to
do
of
late
for
the
remnants
of
the
cold
she
had
caught
the
night
we
were
lost
in
the
storm
still
clung
to
her
don
t
talk
such
nonsense
cecily
cried
the
story
girl
with
unwonted
sharpness
a
sharpness
we
all
understood
all
of
us
in
our
hearts
though
we
never
spoke
of
it
to
each
other
thought
cecily
was
not
as
well
as
she
ought
to
be
that
spring
and
we
hated
to
hear
anything
said
which
seemed
in
any
way
to
touch
or
acknowledge
the
tiny
faint
shadow
which
now
and
again
showed
itself
dimly
athwart
our
sunshine
well
it
was
you
began
talking
of
being
dead
said
felicity
angrily
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
to
talk
of
such
things
cecily
are
you
sure
your
feet
ain
t
damp
we
ought
to
go
in
anyhow
it
s
too
chilly
out
here
for
you
girls
had
better
go
said
dan
but
i
ain
t
going
in
till
old
isaac
frewen
goes
i
ve
no
use
for
i
hate
him
too
said
felicity
agreeing
with
dan
for
once
in
her
life
he
chews
tobacco
all
the
time
and
spits
on
the
floor
the
horrid
pig
and
yet
his
brother
is
an
elder
in
the
church
said
sara
ray
wonderingly
i
know
a
story
about
isaac
frewen
said
the
story
girl
when
he
was
young
he
went
by
the
name
of
oatmeal
frewen
and
he
got
it
this
way
he
was
noted
for
doing
outlandish
things
he
lived
at
markdale
then
and
he
was
a
great
overgrown
awkward
fellow
six
feet
tall
he
drove
over
to
baywater
one
saturday
to
visit
his
uncle
there
and
came
home
the
next
afternoon
and
although
it
was
sunday
he
brought
a
big
bag
of
oatmeal
in
the
wagon
with
him
when
he
came
to
carlisle
church
he
saw
that
service
was
going
on
there
and
he
concluded
to
stop
and
go
in
but
he
didn
t
like
to
leave
his
oatmeal
outside
for
fear
something
would
happen
to
it
because
there
were
always
mischievous
boys
around
so
he
hoisted
the
bag
on
his
back
and
walked
into
church
with
it
and
right
to
the
top
of
the
aisle
to
grandfather
king
s
pew
grandfather
king
used
to
say
he
would
never
forget
it
to
his
dying
day
the
minister
was
preaching
and
everything
was
quiet
and
solemn
when
he
heard
a
snicker
behind
him
grandfather
king
turned
around
with
a
terrible
frown
for
you
know
in
those
days
it
was
thought
a
dreadful
thing
to
laugh
in
church
to
rebuke
the
offender
and
what
did
he
see
but
that
great
hulking
young
isaac
stalking
up
the
aisle
bending
a
little
forward
under
the
weight
of
a
big
bag
of
oatmeal
grandfather
king
was
so
amazed
he
couldn
t
laugh
but
almost
everyone
else
in
the
church
was
laughing
and
grandfather
said
he
never
blamed
them
for
no
funnier
sight
was
ever
seen
young
isaac
turned
into
grandfather
s
pew
and
thumped
the
bag
of
oatmeal
down
on
the
seat
with
a
thud
that
cracked
it
then
he
plumped
down
beside
it
took
off
his
hat
wiped
his
face
and
settled
back
to
listen
to
the
sermon
just
as
if
it
was
all
a
matter
of
course
when
the
service
was
over
he
hoisted
his
bag
up
again
marched
out
of
church
and
drove
home
he
could
never
understand
why
it
made
so
much
talk
but
he
was
known
by
the
name
of
oatmeal
frewen
for
our
laughter
as
we
separated
rang
sweetly
through
the
old
orchard
and
across
the
far
dim
meadows
felicity
and
cecily
went
into
the
house
and
sara
ray
and
the
story
girl
went
home
but
peter
decoyed
me
into
the
granary
to
ask
advice
you
know
felicity
has
a
birthday
next
week
he
said
and
i
want
to
write
her
an
a
a
what
i
gasped
an
ode
repeated
peter
gravely
it
s
poetry
you
know
i
ll
put
it
in
our
but
you
can
t
write
poetry
peter
i
protested
i
m
going
to
try
said
peter
stoutly
that
is
if
you
think
she
won
t
be
offended
at
she
ought
to
feel
flattered
i
replied
you
never
can
tell
how
she
ll
take
things
said
peter
gloomily
of
course
i
ain
t
going
to
sign
my
name
and
if
she
ain
t
pleased
i
won
t
tell
her
i
wrote
it
don
t
you
let
i
promised
i
wouldn
t
and
peter
went
off
with
a
light
heart
he
said
he
meant
to
write
two
lines
every
day
till
he
got
it
done
cupid
was
playing
his
tricks
with
others
than
poor
peter
that
spring
allusion
has
been
made
in
these
chronicles
to
one
cyrus
brisk
and
to
the
fact
that
our
cecily
had
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
said
cyrus
cecily
did
not
regard
her
conquest
with
any
pride
on
the
contrary
it
annoyed
her
terribly
to
be
teased
about
cyrus
she
declared
she
hated
both
him
and
his
name
she
was
as
uncivil
to
him
as
sweet
cecily
could
be
to
anyone
but
the
gallant
cyrus
was
nothing
daunted
he
laid
determined
siege
to
cecily
s
young
heart
by
all
the
methods
known
to
swains
he
placed
delicate
tributes
of
spruce
gum
molasses
taffy
conversation
candies
and
decorated
slate
pencils
on
her
desk
he
persistently
chose
her
in
all
school
games
calling
for
a
partner
he
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
carry
her
basket
from
school
he
offered
to
work
her
sums
for
her
and
rumour
had
it
that
he
had
made
a
wild
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
meant
to
ask
if
he
might
see
her
home
some
night
from
prayer
meeting
cecily
was
quite
frightened
that
he
would
she
confided
to
me
that
she
would
rather
die
than
walk
home
with
him
but
that
if
he
asked
her
she
would
be
too
bashful
to
say
no
so
far
however
cyrus
had
not
molested
her
out
of
school
nor
had
he
as
yet
thumped
willy
fraser
who
was
reported
to
be
very
low
in
his
spirits
over
the
whole
affair
and
now
cyrus
had
written
cecily
a
letter
a
love
letter
mark
you
moreover
he
had
sent
it
through
the
with
a
real
stamp
on
it
its
arrival
made
a
sensation
among
us
dan
brought
it
from
the
office
and
recognizing
the
handwriting
of
cyrus
gave
cecily
no
peace
until
she
showed
us
the
letter
it
was
a
very
sentimental
and
rather
epistle
in
which
the
inflammable
cyrus
reproached
her
in
words
for
her
coldness
and
begged
her
to
answer
his
letter
saying
that
if
she
did
he
would
keep
the
secret
in
cyrus
probably
meant
inviolate
but
cecily
thought
it
was
intended
for
a
poetical
touch
he
signed
himself
your
troo
lover
cyrus
brisk
and
added
in
a
postcript
that
he
couldn
t
eat
or
sleep
for
thinking
of
her
are
you
going
to
answer
it
asked
dan
certainly
not
said
cecily
with
dignity
cyrus
brisk
wants
to
be
kicked
growled
felix
who
never
seemed
to
be
any
particular
friend
of
willy
fraser
s
either
he
d
better
learn
how
to
spell
before
he
takes
to
writing
love
maybe
cyrus
will
starve
to
death
if
you
don
t
suggested
sara
ray
i
hope
he
will
said
cecily
cruelly
she
was
truly
vexed
over
the
letter
and
yet
so
contradictory
a
thing
is
the
feminine
heart
even
at
twelve
years
old
i
think
she
was
a
little
flattered
by
it
also
it
was
her
first
love
letter
and
she
confided
to
me
that
it
gives
you
a
very
queer
feeling
to
get
it
at
all
events
the
letter
though
unanswered
was
not
torn
up
i
feel
sure
cecily
preserved
it
but
she
walked
past
cyrus
next
morning
at
school
with
a
frozen
countenance
evincing
not
the
slightest
pity
for
his
pangs
of
unrequited
affection
cecily
winced
when
pat
caught
a
mouse
visited
a
school
chum
the
day
the
pigs
were
killed
that
she
might
not
hear
their
squealing
and
would
not
have
stepped
on
a
caterpillar
for
anything
yet
she
did
not
care
at
all
how
much
she
made
the
brisk
cyrus
suffer
then
suddenly
all
our
spring
gladness
and
maytime
hopes
were
blighted
as
by
a
killing
frost
sorrow
and
anxiety
pervaded
our
days
and
embittered
our
dreams
by
night
grim
tragedy
held
sway
in
our
lives
for
the
next
fortnight
paddy
disappeared
one
night
he
lapped
his
new
milk
as
usual
at
uncle
roger
s
dairy
door
and
then
sat
blandly
on
the
flat
stone
before
it
giving
the
world
assurance
of
a
cat
sleek
sides
glistening
plumy
tail
gracefully
folded
around
his
paws
brilliant
eyes
watching
the
stir
and
flicker
of
bare
willow
boughs
in
the
twilight
air
above
him
that
was
the
last
seen
of
him
in
the
morning
he
was
not
at
first
we
were
not
seriously
alarmed
paddy
was
no
roving
thomas
but
occasionally
he
vanished
for
a
day
or
so
but
when
two
days
passed
without
his
return
we
became
anxious
the
third
day
worried
us
greatly
and
the
fourth
found
us
distracted
something
has
happened
to
pat
the
story
girl
declared
miserably
he
never
stayed
away
from
home
more
than
two
days
in
his
what
could
have
happened
to
him
asked
felix
he
s
been
poisoned
or
a
dog
has
killed
him
answered
the
story
girl
in
tragic
tones
cecily
began
to
cry
at
this
but
tears
were
of
no
avail
neither
was
anything
else
apparently
we
searched
every
nook
and
cranny
of
barns
and
and
woods
on
both
the
king
farms
we
inquired
far
and
wide
we
roved
over
carlisle
meadows
calling
paddy
s
name
until
aunt
janet
grew
exasperated
and
declared
we
must
stop
making
such
exhibitions
of
ourselves
but
we
found
and
heard
no
trace
of
our
lost
pet
the
story
girl
moped
and
refused
to
be
comforted
cecily
declared
she
could
not
sleep
at
night
for
thinking
of
poor
paddy
dying
miserably
in
some
corner
to
which
he
had
dragged
his
failing
body
or
lying
somewhere
mangled
and
torn
by
a
dog
we
hated
every
dog
we
saw
on
the
ground
that
he
might
be
the
guilty
one
it
s
the
suspense
that
s
so
hard
sobbed
the
story
girl
if
i
just
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
it
wouldn
t
be
quite
so
hard
but
i
don
t
know
whether
he
s
dead
or
alive
he
may
be
living
and
suffering
and
every
night
i
dream
that
he
has
come
home
and
when
i
wake
up
and
find
it
s
only
a
dream
it
just
breaks
my
it
s
ever
so
much
worse
than
when
he
was
so
sick
last
fall
said
cecily
drearily
then
we
knew
that
everything
was
done
for
him
that
could
be
we
could
not
appeal
to
peg
bowen
this
time
in
our
desperation
we
would
have
done
it
but
peg
was
far
away
with
the
first
breath
of
spring
she
was
up
and
off
answering
to
the
lure
of
the
long
road
she
had
not
been
seen
in
her
accustomed
haunts
for
many
a
day
her
pets
were
gaining
their
own
living
in
the
woods
and
her
house
was
locked
up
chapter
xi
the
witch
s
wishbone
when
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
we
gave
up
all
hope
pat
is
dead
said
the
story
girl
hopelessly
as
we
returned
one
evening
from
a
bootless
quest
to
andrew
cowan
s
where
a
strange
gray
cat
had
been
reported
a
cat
which
turned
out
to
be
a
yellowish
brown
nondescript
with
no
tail
to
speak
of
i
m
afraid
so
i
acknowledged
at
last
if
only
peg
bowen
had
been
at
home
she
could
have
found
him
for
us
asserted
peter
her
skull
would
have
told
her
where
he
i
wonder
if
the
wishbone
she
gave
me
would
have
done
any
good
cried
cecily
suddenly
i
d
forgotten
all
about
it
oh
do
you
suppose
it
s
too
late
yet
there
s
nothing
in
a
wishbone
said
dan
impatiently
you
can
t
be
sure
she
told
me
i
d
get
the
wish
i
made
on
it
i
m
going
to
try
whenever
i
get
it
can
t
do
any
harm
anyhow
said
peter
but
i
m
afraid
you
ve
left
it
too
late
if
pat
is
dead
even
a
witch
s
wishbone
can
t
bring
him
back
to
i
ll
never
forgive
myself
for
not
thinking
about
it
before
mourned
cecily
as
soon
as
we
got
home
she
flew
to
the
little
box
upstairs
where
she
kept
her
treasures
and
brought
therefrom
the
dry
and
brittle
wishbone
peg
told
me
how
it
must
be
done
i
m
to
hold
the
wishbone
with
both
hands
like
this
and
walk
backward
repeating
the
wish
nine
times
and
when
i
ve
finished
the
ninth
time
i
m
to
turn
around
nine
times
from
right
to
left
and
then
the
wish
will
come
true
right
do
you
expect
to
see
pat
when
you
finish
turning
said
dan
skeptically
none
of
us
had
any
faith
in
the
incantation
except
peter
and
by
infection
cecily
you
never
could
tell
what
might
happen
cecily
took
the
wishbone
in
her
trembling
little
hands
and
began
her
backward
pacing
repeating
solemnly
i
wish
that
we
may
find
paddy
alive
or
else
his
body
so
that
we
can
bury
him
by
the
time
cecily
had
repeated
this
nine
times
we
were
all
slightly
infected
with
the
desperate
hope
that
something
might
come
of
it
and
when
she
had
made
her
nine
gyrations
we
looked
eagerly
down
the
sunset
lane
half
expecting
to
see
our
lost
pet
but
we
saw
only
the
awkward
man
turning
in
at
the
gate
this
was
almost
as
surprising
as
the
sight
of
pat
himself
would
have
been
but
there
was
no
sign
of
pat
and
hope
flickered
out
in
every
breast
but
peter
s
you
ve
got
to
give
the
spell
time
to
work
he
expostulated
if
pat
was
miles
away
when
it
was
wished
it
wouldn
t
be
reasonable
to
expect
to
see
him
right
but
we
of
little
faith
had
already
lost
that
little
and
it
was
a
very
disconsolate
group
which
the
awkward
man
presently
joined
he
was
smiling
his
rare
beautiful
smile
which
only
children
ever
saw
and
he
lifted
his
hat
to
the
girls
with
no
trace
of
the
shyness
and
awkwardness
for
which
he
was
notorious
good
evening
he
said
have
you
little
people
lost
a
cat
lately
we
stared
peter
said
i
knew
it
in
a
triumphant
pig
s
whisper
the
story
girl
started
eagerly
forward
oh
dale
can
you
tell
us
anything
of
paddy
she
cried
a
silver
gray
cat
with
black
points
and
very
fine
marking
yes
yes
alive
well
doesn
t
that
beat
the
dutch
muttered
dan
but
we
were
all
crowding
about
the
awkward
man
demanding
where
and
when
he
had
found
paddy
you
d
better
come
over
to
my
place
and
make
sure
that
it
really
is
your
cat
suggested
the
awkward
man
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
finding
him
on
the
way
i
must
warn
you
that
he
is
pretty
thin
but
i
think
he
ll
pull
we
obtained
permission
to
go
without
much
difficulty
although
the
spring
evening
was
wearing
late
for
aunt
janet
said
she
supposed
none
of
us
would
sleep
a
wink
that
night
if
we
didn
t
a
joyful
procession
followed
the
awkward
man
and
the
story
girl
across
the
gray
meadows
to
his
home
and
through
his
gate
you
know
that
old
barn
of
mine
back
in
the
woods
said
the
awkward
man
i
go
to
it
only
about
once
in
a
blue
moon
there
was
an
old
barrel
there
upside
down
one
side
resting
on
a
block
of
wood
this
morning
i
went
to
the
barn
to
see
about
having
some
hay
hauled
home
and
i
had
occasion
to
move
the
barrel
i
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
moved
slightly
since
my
last
visit
and
it
was
now
resting
wholly
on
the
floor
i
lifted
it
up
and
there
was
a
cat
lying
on
the
floor
under
it
i
had
heard
you
had
lost
yours
and
i
took
it
this
was
your
pet
i
was
afraid
he
was
dead
at
first
he
was
lying
there
with
his
eyes
closed
but
when
i
bent
over
him
he
opened
them
and
gave
a
pitiful
little
mew
or
rather
his
mouth
made
the
motion
of
a
mew
for
he
was
too
weak
to
utter
a
oh
poor
poor
paddy
said
cecily
tearfully
he
couldn
t
stand
so
i
carried
him
home
and
gave
him
just
a
little
milk
fortunately
he
was
able
to
lap
it
i
gave
him
a
little
more
at
intervals
all
day
and
when
i
left
he
was
able
to
crawl
around
i
think
he
ll
be
all
right
but
you
ll
have
to
be
careful
how
you
feed
him
for
a
few
days
don
t
let
your
hearts
run
away
with
your
judgment
and
kill
him
with
do
you
suppose
any
one
put
him
under
that
barrel
asked
the
story
girl
no
the
barn
was
locked
nothing
but
a
cat
could
get
in
i
suppose
he
went
under
the
barrel
perhaps
in
pursuit
of
a
mouse
and
somehow
knocked
it
off
the
block
and
so
imprisoned
paddy
was
sitting
before
the
fire
in
the
awkward
man
s
clean
bare
kitchen
thin
why
he
was
literally
skin
and
bone
and
his
fur
was
dull
and
lustreless
it
almost
broke
our
hearts
to
see
our
beautiful
paddy
brought
so
low
oh
how
he
must
have
suffered
moaned
cecily
he
ll
be
as
prosperous
as
ever
in
a
week
or
two
said
the
awkward
man
kindly
the
story
girl
gathered
paddy
up
in
her
arms
most
mellifluously
did
he
purr
as
we
crowded
around
to
stroke
him
with
friendly
joy
he
licked
our
hands
with
his
little
red
tongue
poor
paddy
was
a
thankful
cat
he
was
no
longer
lost
starving
imprisoned
helpless
he
was
with
his
comrades
once
more
and
he
was
going
home
home
to
his
old
familiar
haunts
of
orchard
and
dairy
and
granary
to
his
daily
rations
of
new
milk
and
cream
to
the
cosy
corner
of
his
own
fireside
we
trooped
home
joyfully
the
story
girl
in
our
midst
carrying
paddy
hugged
against
her
shoulder
never
did
april
stars
look
down
on
a
happier
band
of
travellers
on
the
golden
road
there
was
a
little
gray
wind
out
in
the
meadows
that
night
and
it
danced
along
beside
us
on
viewless
fairy
feet
and
sang
a
delicate
song
of
the
lovely
waiting
years
while
the
night
laid
her
beautiful
hands
of
blessing
over
the
world
you
see
what
peg
s
wishbone
did
said
peter
triumphantly
now
look
here
peter
don
t
talk
nonsense
expostulated
dan
the
awkward
man
found
paddy
this
morning
and
had
started
to
bring
us
word
before
cecily
ever
thought
of
the
wishbone
do
you
mean
to
say
you
believe
he
wouldn
t
have
come
walking
up
our
lane
just
when
he
did
if
she
had
never
thought
of
it
i
mean
to
say
that
i
wouldn
t
mind
if
i
had
several
wishbones
of
the
same
kind
retorted
peter
stubbornly
of
course
i
don
t
think
the
wishbone
had
really
anything
to
do
with
our
getting
paddy
back
but
i
m
glad
i
tried
it
for
all
that
remarked
cecily
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
well
anyhow
we
ve
got
pat
and
that
s
the
main
thing
said
felix
and
i
hope
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
him
to
stay
home
after
this
commented
felicity
they
say
the
barrens
are
full
of
mayflowers
said
the
story
girl
let
us
have
a
mayflower
picnic
tomorrow
to
celebrate
paddy
s
safe
chapter
xii
flowers
o
may
accordingly
we
went
following
the
lure
of
dancing
winds
to
a
certain
westward
sloping
hill
lying
under
the
blue
of
spring
skies
feathered
over
with
lisping
young
pines
and
firs
which
cupped
little
hollows
and
corners
where
the
sunshine
got
in
and
never
got
out
again
but
stayed
there
and
grew
mellow
coaxing
dear
things
to
bloom
long
before
they
would
dream
of
waking
up
elsewhere
twas
there
we
found
our
mayflowers
after
faithful
seeking
mayflowers
you
must
know
never
flaunt
themselves
they
must
be
sought
as
becomes
them
and
then
they
will
yield
up
their
treasures
to
the
seeker
clusters
of
and
that
have
in
them
the
very
soul
of
all
the
springs
that
ever
were
in
something
it
seems
gross
to
call
perfume
so
exquisite
and
spiritual
is
it
we
wandered
gaily
over
the
hill
calling
to
each
other
with
laughter
and
jest
getting
parted
and
delightfully
lost
in
that
little
pathless
wilderness
and
finding
each
other
unexpectedly
in
nooks
and
dips
and
sunny
silences
where
the
wind
purred
and
gentled
and
went
softly
when
the
sun
began
to
hang
low
sending
great
streamers
of
radiance
up
to
the
zenith
we
foregathered
in
a
tiny
sequestered
valley
full
of
young
green
fern
lying
in
the
shadow
of
a
wooded
hill
in
it
was
a
shallow
pool
a
glimmering
green
sheet
of
water
on
whose
banks
nymphs
might
dance
as
blithely
as
ever
they
did
on
argive
hill
or
in
cretan
dale
there
we
sat
and
stripped
the
faded
leaves
and
stems
from
our
spoil
making
up
the
blossoms
into
bouquets
to
fill
our
baskets
with
sweetness
the
story
girl
twisted
a
spray
of
divinest
pink
in
her
brown
curls
and
told
us
an
old
legend
of
a
beautiful
indian
maiden
who
died
of
a
broken
heart
when
the
first
snows
of
winter
were
falling
because
she
believed
her
lover
was
false
but
he
came
back
in
the
spring
time
from
his
long
captivity
and
when
he
heard
that
she
was
dead
he
sought
her
grave
to
mourn
her
and
lo
under
the
dead
leaves
of
the
old
year
he
found
sweet
sprays
of
a
blossom
never
seen
before
and
knew
that
it
was
a
message
of
love
and
remembrance
from
his

tying
his
mayflowers
together
in
one
huge
solid
bunch
not
for
dan
the
bother
of
filling
his
basket
with
the
loose
sprays
mingled
with
feathery
elephant
and
trails
of
creeping
spruce
as
the
rest
of
us

the

t
a
bit
mad
it
s
felicity
what
on
earth
is
that
at
the
bottom
of
your
basket
cecily
it
s
a
history
of
the
reformation
in
france
confessed
poor
cecily
by
a
man
named
i
can
t
pronounce
it
i
heard
marwood
saying
it
was
a
book
everyone
ought
to
read
so
i
began
it
last
sunday
i
brought
it
along
today
to
read
when
i
got
tired
picking
flowers
i
d
ever
so
much
rather
have
brought
ester
reid
there
s
so
much
in
the
history
i
can
t
understand
and
it
is
so
dreadful
to
read
of
people
being
burned
to
death
but
i
felt
i
ought
to
read
do
you
really
think
your
mind
has
improved
any
asked
sara
ray
seriously
wreathing
the
handle
of
her
basket
with
creeping
spruce
no
i
m
afraid
it
hasn
t
one
bit
answered
cecily
sadly
i
feel
that
i
haven
t
succeeded
very
well
in
keeping
my
i
ve
kept
mine
said
felicity
complacently
it
s
easy
to
keep
just
one
retorted
cecily
rather
resentfully
it
s
not
so
easy
to
think
beautiful
thoughts
answered
felicity
it
s
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
said
the
story
girl
tiptoeing
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
to
peep
at
her
own
arch
reflection
as
some
nymph
left
over
from
the
golden
age
might
do
beautiful
thoughts
just
crowd
into
your
mind
at
oh
yes
at
times
but
that
s
different
from
thinking
one
regularly
at
a
given
hour
and
mother
is
always
calling
up
the
stairs
for
me
to
hurry
up
and
get
dressed
and
it
s
very
hard
that
s
so
conceded
the
story
girl
there
are
times
when
i
can
t
think
anything
but
gray
thoughts
then
other
days
i
think
pink
and
blue
and
gold
and
purple
and
rainbow
thoughts
all
the
the
idea
as
if
thoughts
were
coloured
giggled
felicity
oh
they
are
cried
the
story
girl
why
i
can
always
see
the
colour
of
any
thought
i
think
can
t
you
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
declared
felicity
and
i
don
t
believe
it
i
believe
you
are
just
making
that
indeed
i
m
not
why
i
always
supposed
everyone
thought
in
colours
it
must
be
very
tiresome
if
you
don
when
you
think
of
me
what
colour
is
it
asked
peter
curiously
yellow
answered
the
story
girl
promptly
and
cecily
is
a
sweet
pink
like
those
mayflowers
and
sara
ray
is
very
pale
blue
and
dan
is
red
and
felix
is
yellow
like
peter
and
bev
is
what
colour
am
i
asked
felicity
amid
the
laughter
at
my
expense
you
re
you
re
like
a
rainbow
answered
the
story
girl
rather
reluctantly
she
had
to
be
honest
but
she
would
rather
not
have
complimented
felicity
and
you
needn
t
laugh
at
bev
his
stripes
are
beautiful
it
isn
t
he
that
is
striped
it
s
just
the
thought
of
him
peg
bowen
is
a
queer
sort
of
yellowish
green
and
the
awkward
man
is
lilac
aunt
olivia
is
mixed
with
gold
and
uncle
roger
is
navy
i
never
heard
such
nonsense
declared
felicity
the
rest
of
us
were
rather
inclined
to
agree
with
her
for
once
we
thought
the
story
girl
was
making
fun
of
us
but
i
believe
she
really
had
a
strange
gift
of
thinking
in
colours
in
later
years
when
we
were
grown
up
she
told
me
of
it
again
she
said
that
everything
had
colour
in
her
thought
the
months
of
the
year
ran
through
all
the
tints
of
the
spectrum
the
days
of
the
week
were
arrayed
as
solomon
in
his
glory
morning
was
golden
noon
orange
evening
crystal
blue
and
night
violet
every
idea
came
to
her
mind
robed
in
its
own
especial
hue
perhaps
that
was
why
her
voice
and
words
had
such
a
charm
conveying
to
the
listeners
perception
such
fine
shadings
of
meaning
and
tint
and
music
well
let
s
go
and
have
something
to
eat
suggested
dan
what
colour
is
eating
sara
golden
brown
just
the
colour
of
a
molasses
cooky
laughed
the
story
girl
we
sat
on
the
ferny
bank
of
the
pool
and
ate
of
the
generous
basket
aunt
janet
had
provided
with
appetites
sharpened
by
the
keen
spring
air
and
our
wilderness
rovings
felicity
had
made
some
very
nice
sandwiches
of
ham
which
we
all
appreciated
except
dan
who
declared
he
didn
t
like
things
minced
up
and
dug
out
of
the
basket
a
chunk
of
boiled
pork
which
he
proceeded
to
saw
up
with
a
and
devour
with
gusto
i
told
ma
to
put
this
in
for
me
there
s
some
chew
to
it
he
said
you
are
not
a
bit
refined
commented
felicity
not
a
morsel
my
love
grinned
dan
you
make
me
think
of
a
story
i
heard
uncle
roger
telling
about
cousin
annetta
king
said
the
story
girl
jeremiah
king
used
to
live
where
uncle
roger
lives
now
when
grandfather
king
was
alive
and
uncle
roger
was
a
boy
in
those
days
it
was
thought
rather
coarse
for
a
young
lady
to
have
too
hearty
an
appetite
and
she
was
more
admired
if
she
was
delicate
about
what
she
ate
cousin
annetta
set
out
to
be
very
refined
indeed
she
pretended
to
have
no
appetite
at
all
one
afternoon
she
was
invited
to
tea
at
grandfather
king
s
when
they
had
some
special
company
people
from
charlottetown
cousin
annetta
said
she
could
hardly
eat
anything
you
know
uncle
abraham
she
said
in
a
very
affected
voice
i
really
hardly
eat
enough
to
keep
a
bird
alive
mother
says
she
wonders
how
i
continue
to
and
she
picked
and
pecked
until
grandfather
king
declared
he
would
like
to
throw
something
at
her
after
tea
cousin
annetta
went
home
and
just
about
dark
grandfather
king
went
over
to
uncle
jeremiah
s
on
an
errand
as
he
passed
the
open
lighted
pantry
window
he
happened
to
glance
in
and
what
do
you
think
he
saw
delicate
cousin
annetta
standing
at
the
dresser
with
a
big
loaf
of
bread
beside
her
and
a
big
platterful
of
cold
boiled
pork
in
front
of
her
and
annetta
was
hacking
off
great
chunks
like
dan
there
and
gobbling
them
down
as
if
she
was
starving
grandfather
king
couldn
t
resist
the
temptation
he
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
said
i
m
glad
your
appetite
has
come
back
to
you
annetta
your
mother
needn
t
worry
about
your
continuing
to
exist
as
long
as
you
can
tuck
away
fat
salt
pork
in
that
cousin
annetta
never
forgave
him
but
she
never
pretended
to
be
delicate
the
jews
don
t
believe
in
eating
pork
said
peter
i
m
glad
i
m
not
a
jew
and
i
guess
cousin
annetta
was
too
said
dan
i
like
bacon
but
i
can
never
look
at
a
pig
without
wondering
if
they
were
ever
intended
to
be
eaten
remarked
cecily
naively
when
we
finished
our
lunch
the
barrens
were
already
wrapping
themselves
in
a
dim
blue
dusk
and
falling
upon
rest
in
dell
and
dingle
but
out
in
the
open
there
was
still
much
light
of
a
fine
sort
and
the
robins
whistled
us
home
in
it
horns
of
elfland
never
sounded
more
sweetly
around
hoary
castle
and
ruined
fane
than
those
vesper
calls
of
the
robins
from
the
twilight
spruce
woods
and
across
green
pastures
lying
under
the
pale
radiance
of
a
young
moon
when
we
reached
home
we
found
that
miss
reade
had
been
up
to
the
hill
farm
on
an
errand
and
was
just
leaving
the
story
girl
went
for
a
walk
with
her
and
came
back
with
an
important
expression
on
her
face
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
story
to
tell
said
felix
one
is
growing
it
isn
t
a
whole
story
yet
answered
the
story
girl
mysteriously
what
is
it
asked
cecily
i
can
t
tell
you
till
it
s
fully
grown
said
the
story
girl
but
i
ll
tell
you
a
pretty
little
story
the
awkward
man
told
us
told
me
tonight
he
was
walking
in
his
garden
as
we
went
by
looking
at
his
tulip
beds
his
tulips
are
up
ever
so
much
higher
than
ours
and
i
asked
him
how
he
managed
to
coax
them
along
so
early
and
he
said
he
didn
t
do
it
it
was
all
the
work
of
the
pixies
who
lived
in
the
woods
across
the
brook
there
were
more
pixy
babies
than
usual
this
spring
and
the
mothers
were
in
a
hurry
for
the
cradles
the
tulips
are
the
pixy
babies
cradles
it
seems
the
mother
pixies
come
out
of
the
woods
at
twilight
and
rock
their
tiny
little
brown
babies
to
sleep
in
the
tulip
cups
that
is
the
reason
why
tulip
blooms
last
so
much
longer
than
other
blossoms
the
pixy
babies
must
have
a
cradle
until
they
are
grown
up
they
grow
very
fast
you
see
and
the
awkward
man
says
on
a
spring
evening
when
the
tulips
are
out
you
can
hear
the
sweetest
softest
clearest
fairy
music
in
his
garden
and
it
is
the
pixy
folk
singing
as
they
rock
the
pixy
babies
to
then
the
awkward
man
says
what
isn
t
true
said
felicity
severely
chapter
xiii
a
surprising
announcement
nothing
exciting
has
happened
for
ever
so
long
said
the
story
girl
discontentedly
one
late
may
evening
as
we
lingered
under
the
wonderful
white
bloom
of
the
cherry
trees
there
was
a
long
row
of
them
in
the
orchard
with
a
lombardy
poplar
at
either
end
and
a
hedge
of
lilacs
behind
when
the
wind
blew
over
them
all
the
spicy
breezes
of
ceylon
s
isle
were
never
sweeter
it
was
a
time
of
wonder
and
marvel
of
the
soft
touch
of
silver
rain
on
greening
fields
of
the
incredible
delicacy
of
young
leaves
of
blossom
in
field
and
garden
and
wood
the
whole
world
bloomed
in
a
flush
and
tremor
of
maiden
loveliness
instinct
with
all
the
evasive
fleeting
charm
of
spring
and
girlhood
and
young
morning
we
felt
and
enjoyed
it
all
without
understanding
or
analyzing
it
it
was
enough
to
be
glad
and
young
with
spring
on
the
golden
road
i
don
t
like
excitement
very
much
said
cecily
it
makes
one
so
tired
i
m
sure
it
was
exciting
enough
when
paddy
was
missing
but
we
didn
t
find
that
very
no
but
it
was
interesting
returned
the
story
girl
thoughtfully
after
all
i
believe
i
d
rather
be
miserable
than
i
wouldn
t
then
said
felicity
decidedly
and
you
need
never
be
dull
when
you
have
work
to
do
satan
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
well
mischief
is
interesting
laughed
the
story
girl
and
i
thought
you
didn
t
think
it
to
speak
of
that
person
felicity
it
s
all
right
if
you
call
him
by
his
polite
name
said
felicity
stiffly
why
does
the
lombardy
poplar
hold
its
branches
straight
up
in
the
air
like
that
when
all
the
other
poplars
hold
theirs
out
or
hang
them
down
interjected
peter
who
had
been
gazing
intently
at
the
slender
spire
showing
darkly
against
the
fine
blue
eastern
sky
because
it
grows
that
way
said
felicity
oh
i
know
a
story
about
that
cried
the
story
girl
once
upon
a
time
an
old
man
found
the
pot
of
gold
at
the
rainbow
s
end
there
is
a
pot
there
it
is
said
but
it
is
very
hard
to
find
because
you
can
never
get
to
the
rainbow
s
end
before
it
vanishes
from
your
sight
but
this
old
man
found
it
just
at
sunset
when
iris
the
guardian
of
the
rainbow
gold
happened
to
be
absent
as
he
was
a
long
way
from
home
and
the
pot
was
very
big
and
heavy
he
decided
to
hide
it
until
morning
and
then
get
one
of
his
sons
to
go
with
him
and
help
him
carry
it
so
he
hid
it
under
the
boughs
of
the
sleeping
poplar
tree
when
iris
came
back
she
missed
the
pot
of
gold
and
of
course
she
was
in
a
sad
way
about
it
she
sent
mercury
the
messenger
of
the
gods
to
look
for
it
for
she
didn
t
dare
leave
the
rainbow
again
lest
somebody
should
run
off
with
that
too
mercury
asked
all
the
trees
if
they
had
seen
the
pot
of
gold
and
the
elm
oak
and
pine
pointed
to
the
poplar
and
said
the
poplar
can
tell
you
where
it
how
can
i
tell
you
where
it
is
cried
the
poplar
and
she
held
up
all
her
branches
in
surprise
just
as
we
hold
up
our
hands
and
down
tumbled
the
pot
of
gold
the
poplar
was
amazed
and
indignant
for
she
was
a
very
honest
tree
she
stretched
her
boughs
high
above
her
head
and
declared
that
she
would
always
hold
them
like
that
so
that
nobody
could
hide
stolen
gold
under
them
again
and
she
taught
all
the
little
poplars
she
knew
to
stand
the
same
way
and
that
is
why
lombardy
poplars
always
do
but
the
aspen
poplar
leaves
are
always
shaking
even
on
the
very
calmest
day
and
do
you
know
why
and
then
she
told
us
the
old
legend
that
the
cross
on
which
the
saviour
of
the
world
suffered
was
made
of
aspen
poplar
wood
and
so
never
again
could
its
poor
shaken
shivering
leaves
know
rest
or
peace
there
was
an
aspen
in
the
orchard
the
very
embodiment
of
youth
and
spring
in
its
litheness
and
symmetry
its
little
leaves
were
hanging
tremulously
not
yet
so
fully
blown
as
to
hide
its
development
of
bough
and
twig
making
poetry
against
the
spiritual
tints
of
a
spring
sunset
it
does
look
sad
said
peter
but
it
is
a
pretty
tree
and
it
wasn
t
its
there
s
a
heavy
dew
and
it
s
time
we
stopped
talking
nonsense
and
went
in
decreed
felicity
if
we
don
t
we
ll
all
have
a
cold
and
then
we
ll
be
miserable
enough
but
it
won
t
be
very
all
the
same
i
wish
something
exciting
would
happen
finished
the
story
girl
as
we
walked
up
through
the
orchard
peopled
with
its
shadows
there
s
a
new
moon
tonight
so
may
be
you
ll
get
your
wish
said
peter
my
aunt
jane
didn
t
believe
there
was
anything
in
the
moon
business
but
you
never
can
the
story
girl
did
get
her
wish
something
happened
the
very
next
day
she
joined
us
in
the
afternoon
with
a
quite
indescribable
expression
on
her
face
compounded
of
triumph
anticipation
and
regret
her
eyes
betrayed
that
she
had
been
crying
but
in
them
shone
a
chastened
exultation
whatever
the
story
girl
mourned
over
it
was
evident
she
was
not
without
hope
i
have
some
news
to
tell
you
she
said
importantly
can
you
guess
what
it
is
we
couldn
t
and
wouldn
t
try
tell
us
right
off
implored
felix
you
look
as
if
it
was
something
so
it
is
listen
aunt
olivia
is
going
to
be
we
stared
in
blank
amazement
peg
bowen
s
hint
had
faded
from
our
minds
and
we
had
never
put
much
faith
in
it
aunt
olivia
i
don
t
believe
it
cried
felicity
flatly
who
told
you
aunt
olivia
herself
so
it
is
perfectly
true
i
m
awfully
sorry
in
one
way
but
oh
won
t
it
be
splendid
to
have
a
real
wedding
in
the
family
she
s
going
to
have
a
big
wedding
and
i
am
to
be
i
shouldn
t
think
you
were
old
enough
to
be
a
bridesmaid
said
felicity
sharply
i
m
nearly
fifteen
anyway
aunt
olivia
says
i
have
to
who
s
she
going
to
marry
asked
cecily
gathering
herself
together
after
the
shock
and
finding
that
the
world
was
going
on
just
the
same
his
name
is
seton
and
he
is
a
halifax
man
she
met
him
when
she
was
at
uncle
edward
s
last
summer
they
ve
been
engaged
ever
since
the
wedding
is
to
be
the
third
week
in
and
our
school
concert
comes
off
the
next
week
complained
felicity
why
do
things
always
come
together
like
that
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
aunt
olivia
is
going
away
i
m
coming
to
live
at
your
house
answered
the
story
girl
rather
timidly
she
did
not
know
how
felicity
might
like
that
but
felicity
took
it
rather
well
you
ve
been
here
most
of
the
time
anyhow
so
it
ll
just
be
that
you
ll
sleep
and
eat
here
too
but
what
s
to
become
of
uncle
roger
aunt
olivia
says
he
ll
have
to
get
married
too
but
uncle
roger
says
he
d
rather
hire
a
housekeeper
than
marry
one
because
in
the
first
case
he
could
turn
her
off
if
he
didn
t
like
her
but
in
the
second
case
he
couldn
there
ll
be
a
lot
of
cooking
to
do
for
the
wedding
reflected
felicity
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
i
s
pose
aunt
olivia
will
want
some
rusks
made
i
hope
she
has
plenty
of
laid
in
said
dan
it
s
a
pity
you
don
t
use
some
of
that
you
re
so
fond
of
talking
about
yourself
retorted
felicity
when
anyone
has
a
mouth
the
size
of
yours
the
teeth
show
so
i
brush
my
teeth
every
sunday
asseverated
dan
every
sunday
you
ought
to
brush
them
every
did
anyone
ever
hear
such
nonsense
demanded
dan
sincerely
well
you
know
it
really
does
say
so
in
the
family
guide
said
cecily
quietly
then
the
family
guide
people
must
have
lots
more
spare
time
than
i
have
retorted
dan
contemptuously
just
think
the
story
girl
will
have
her
name
in
the
papers
if
she
s
bridesmaid
marvelled
sara
ray
in
the
halifax
papers
too
added
felix
since
seton
is
a
halifax
man
what
is
his
first
name
and
will
we
have
to
call
him
uncle
robert
not
until
he
s
married
to
her
then
we
will
of
i
hope
your
aunt
olivia
won
t
disappear
before
the
ceremony
remarked
sara
ray
who
was
surreptitiously
reading
the
vanquished
bride
by
valeria
montague
in
the
family
guide
i
hope
seton
won
t
fail
to
show
up
like
your
cousin
rachel
ward
s
beau
said
peter
that
makes
me
think
of
another
story
i
read
the
other
day
about
andrew
king
and
aunt
georgina
laughed
the
story
girl
it
happened
eighty
years
ago
it
was
a
very
stormy
winter
and
the
roads
were
bad
uncle
andrew
lived
in
carlisle
and
aunt
georgina
she
was
miss
georgina
matheson
then
lived
away
up
west
so
he
couldn
t
get
to
see
her
very
often
they
agreed
to
be
married
that
winter
but
georgina
couldn
t
set
the
day
exactly
because
her
brother
who
lived
in
ontario
was
coming
home
for
a
visit
and
she
wanted
to
be
married
while
he
was
home
so
it
was
arranged
that
she
was
to
write
uncle
andrew
and
tell
him
what
day
to
come
she
did
and
she
told
him
to
come
on
a
tuesday
but
her
writing
wasn
t
very
good
and
poor
uncle
andrew
thought
she
wrote
thursday
so
on
thursday
he
drove
all
the
way
to
georgina
s
home
to
be
married
it
was
forty
miles
and
a
bitter
cold
day
but
it
wasn
t
any
colder
than
the
reception
he
got
from
georgina
she
was
out
in
the
porch
with
her
head
tied
up
in
a
towel
picking
geese
she
had
been
all
ready
tuesday
and
her
friends
and
the
minister
were
there
and
the
wedding
supper
prepared
but
there
was
no
bridegroom
and
georgina
was
furious
nothing
uncle
andrew
could
say
would
appease
her
she
wouldn
t
listen
to
a
word
of
explanation
but
told
him
to
go
and
never
show
his
nose
there
again
so
poor
uncle
andrew
had
to
go
ruefully
home
hoping
that
she
would
relent
later
on
because
he
was
really
very
much
in
love
with
and
did
she
queried
felicity
she
did
thirteen
years
exactly
from
that
day
they
were
married
it
took
her
just
that
long
to
forgive
it
took
her
just
that
long
to
find
out
she
couldn
t
get
anybody
else
said
dan
cynically
chapter
xiv
a
prodigal
returns
aunt
olivia
and
the
story
girl
lived
in
a
whirlwind
of
dressmaking
after
that
and
enjoyed
it
hugely
cecily
and
felicity
also
had
to
have
new
dresses
for
the
great
event
and
they
talked
of
little
else
for
a
fortnight
cecily
declared
that
she
hated
to
go
to
sleep
because
she
was
sure
to
dream
that
she
was
at
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
in
her
old
faded
gingham
dress
and
a
ragged
apron
and
no
shoes
or
stockings
she
added
and
i
can
t
move
and
everyone
walks
past
and
looks
at
my
that
s
only
in
a
dream
mourned
sara
ray
but
i
may
have
to
wear
my
last
summer
s
white
dress
to
the
wedding
it
s
too
short
but
ma
says
it
s
plenty
good
for
this
summer
i
ll
be
so
mortified
if
i
have
to
wear
i
d
rather
not
go
at
all
than
wear
a
dress
that
wasn
t
nice
said
felicity
pleasantly
i
d
go
to
the
wedding
if
i
had
to
go
in
my
school
dress
cried
sara
ray
i
ve
never
been
to
anything
i
wouldn
t
miss
it
for
the
my
aunt
jane
always
said
that
if
you
were
neat
and
tidy
it
didn
t
matter
whether
you
were
dressed
fine
or
not
said
peter
i
m
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
about
your
aunt
jane
said
felicity
crossly
peter
looked
grieved
but
held
his
peace
felicity
was
very
hard
on
him
that
spring
but
his
loyalty
never
wavered
everything
she
said
or
did
was
right
in
peter
s
eyes
it
s
all
very
well
to
be
neat
and
tidy
said
sara
ray
but
i
like
a
little
style
i
think
you
ll
find
your
mother
will
get
you
a
new
dress
after
all
comforted
cecily
anyway
nobody
will
notice
you
because
everyone
will
be
looking
at
the
bride
aunt
olivia
will
make
a
lovely
bride
just
think
how
sweet
she
ll
look
in
a
white
silk
dress
and
a
floating
she
says
she
is
going
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
out
here
in
the
orchard
under
her
own
tree
said
the
story
girl
won
t
that
be
romantic
it
almost
makes
me
feel
like
getting
married
what
a
way
to
talk
rebuked
felicity
and
you
only
lots
of
people
have
been
married
at
fifteen
laughed
the
story
girl
lady
jane
gray
but
you
are
always
saying
that
valeria
montague
s
stories
are
silly
and
not
true
to
life
so
that
is
no
argument
retorted
felicity
who
knew
more
about
cooking
than
about
history
and
evidently
imagined
that
the
lady
jane
gray
was
one
of
valeria
s
titled
heroines
the
wedding
was
a
perennial
source
of
conversation
among
us
in
those
days
but
presently
its
interest
palled
for
a
time
in
the
light
of
another
quite
tremendous
happening
one
saturday
night
peter
s
mother
called
to
take
him
home
with
her
for
sunday
she
had
been
working
at
james
frewen
s
and
frewen
was
driving
her
home
we
had
never
seen
peter
s
mother
before
and
we
looked
at
her
with
discreet
curiosity
she
was
a
plump
little
woman
neat
as
a
pin
but
with
a
rather
tired
and
face
that
looked
as
if
it
should
have
been
rosy
and
jolly
life
had
been
a
hard
battle
for
her
and
i
rather
think
that
her
little
lad
was
all
that
had
kept
heart
and
spirit
in
her
peter
went
home
with
her
and
returned
sunday
evening
we
were
in
the
orchard
sitting
around
the
pulpit
stone
where
we
had
according
to
the
custom
of
the
households
of
king
been
learning
our
golden
texts
and
memory
verses
for
the
next
sunday
school
lesson
paddy
grown
sleek
and
handsome
again
was
sitting
on
the
stone
itself
washing
his
jowls
peter
joined
us
with
a
very
queer
expression
on
his
face
he
seemed
bursting
with
some
news
which
he
wanted
to
tell
and
yet
hardly
liked
to
why
are
you
looking
so
mysterious
peter
demanded
the
story
girl
what
do
you
think
has
happened
asked
peter
solemnly
what
has
my
father
has
come
home
answered
peter
the
announcement
produced
all
the
sensation
he
could
have
wished
we
crowded
around
him
in
excitement
peter
when
did
he
come
back
saturday
night
he
was
there
when
ma
and
i
got
home
it
give
her
an
awful
turn
i
didn
t
know
him
at
first
of
peter
craig
i
believe
you
are
glad
your
father
has
come
back
cried
the
story
girl
course
i
m
glad
retorted
peter
and
after
you
saying
you
didn
t
want
ever
to
see
him
again
said
felicity
you
just
wait
you
haven
t
heard
my
story
yet
i
wouldn
t
have
been
glad
to
see
father
if
he
d
come
back
the
same
as
he
went
away
but
he
is
a
changed
man
he
happened
to
go
into
a
revival
meeting
one
night
this
spring
and
he
got
converted
and
he
s
come
home
to
stay
and
he
says
he
s
never
going
to
drink
another
drop
but
he
s
going
to
look
after
his
family
ma
isn
t
to
do
any
more
washing
for
nobody
but
him
and
me
and
i
m
not
to
be
a
hired
boy
any
longer
he
says
i
can
stay
with
your
uncle
roger
till
the
fall
cause
i
promised
i
would
but
after
that
i
m
to
stay
home
and
go
to
school
right
along
and
learn
to
be
whatever
i
d
like
to
be
i
tell
you
it
made
me
feel
queer
everything
seemed
to
be
upset
but
he
gave
ma
forty
dollars
every
cent
he
had
so
i
guess
he
really
is
i
hope
it
will
last
i
m
sure
said
felicity
she
did
not
say
it
nastily
however
we
were
all
glad
for
peter
s
sake
though
a
little
dizzy
over
the
unexpectedness
of
it
all
this
is
what
i
d
like
to
know
said
peter
how
did
peg
bowen
know
my
father
was
coming
home
don
t
you
tell
me
she
isn
t
a
witch
after
and
she
knew
about
your
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
too
added
sara
ray
oh
well
she
likely
heard
that
from
some
one
grown
up
folks
talk
things
over
long
before
they
tell
them
to
children
said
cecily
well
she
couldn
t
have
heard
father
was
coming
home
from
any
one
answered
peter
he
was
converted
up
in
maine
where
nobody
knew
him
and
he
never
told
a
soul
he
was
coming
till
he
got
here
no
you
can
believe
what
you
like
but
i
m
satisfied
at
last
that
peg
is
a
witch
and
that
skull
of
hers
does
tell
her
things
she
told
me
father
was
coming
home
and
he
come
how
happy
you
must
be
sighed
sara
ray
romantically
it
s
just
like
that
story
in
the
family
guide
where
the
missing
earl
comes
home
to
his
family
just
as
the
countess
and
lady
violetta
are
going
to
be
turned
out
by
the
cruel
felicity
sniffed
there
s
some
difference
i
guess
the
earl
had
been
imprisoned
for
years
in
a
loathsome
perhaps
peter
s
father
had
too
if
we
but
realized
it
imprisoned
in
the
dungeon
of
his
own
evil
appetites
and
habits
than
which
none
could
be
more
loathsome
but
a
power
mightier
than
the
forces
of
evil
had
struck
off
his
fetters
and
led
him
back
to
his
liberty
and
light
and
no
countess
or
lady
of
high
degree
could
have
welcomed
a
earl
home
more
joyfully
than
the
tired
little
washerwoman
had
welcomed
the
erring
husband
of
her
youth
but
in
peter
s
ointment
of
joy
there
was
a
fly
or
two
so
very
very
few
things
are
flawless
in
this
world
even
on
the
golden
road
of
course
i
m
awful
glad
that
father
has
come
back
and
that
ma
won
t
have
to
wash
any
more
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
there
are
two
things
that
kind
of
worry
me
my
aunt
jane
always
said
that
it
didn
t
do
any
good
to
worry
and
i
s
pose
it
don
t
but
it
s
kind
of
a
what
s
worrying
you
asked
felix
well
for
one
thing
i
ll
feel
awful
bad
to
go
away
from
you
all
i
ll
miss
you
just
dreadful
and
i
won
t
even
be
able
to
go
to
the
same
school
i
ll
have
to
go
to
markdale
but
you
must
come
and
see
us
often
said
felicity
graciously
markdale
isn
t
so
far
away
and
you
could
spend
every
other
saturday
afternoon
with
us
peter
s
black
eyes
filled
with
adoring
gratitude
that
s
so
kind
of
you
felicity
i
ll
come
as
often
as
i
can
of
course
but
it
won
t
be
the
same
as
being
around
with
you
all
the
time
the
other
thing
is
even
worse
you
see
it
was
a
methodist
revival
father
got
converted
in
and
so
of
course
he
joined
the
methodist
church
he
wasn
t
anything
before
he
used
to
say
he
was
a
nothingarian
and
lived
up
to
it
kind
of
bragging
like
but
he
s
a
strong
methodist
now
and
is
going
to
go
to
markdale
methodist
church
and
pay
to
the
salary
now
what
ll
he
say
when
i
tell
him
i
m
a
presbyterian
you
haven
t
told
him
yet
asked
the
story
girl
no
i
didn
t
dare
i
was
scared
he
d
say
i
d
have
to
be
a
well
methodists
are
pretty
near
as
good
as
presbyterians
said
felicity
with
the
air
of
one
making
a
great
concession
i
guess
they
re
every
bit
as
good
retorted
peter
but
that
ain
t
the
point
i
ve
got
to
be
a
presbyterian
cause
i
stick
to
a
thing
when
i
once
decide
it
but
i
expect
father
will
be
mad
when
he
finds
if
he
s
converted
he
oughtn
t
to
get
mad
said
dan
well
lots
o
people
do
but
if
he
isn
t
mad
he
ll
be
sorry
and
that
ll
be
even
worse
for
a
presbyterian
i
m
bound
to
be
but
i
expect
it
will
make
things
you
needn
t
tell
him
anything
about
it
advised
felicity
just
keep
quiet
and
go
to
the
methodist
church
until
you
get
big
and
then
you
can
go
where
you
no
that
wouldn
t
be
honest
said
peter
sturdily
my
aunt
jane
always
said
it
was
best
to
be
open
and
above
board
in
everything
and
especially
in
religion
so
i
ll
tell
father
right
out
but
i
ll
wait
a
few
weeks
so
as
not
to
spoil
things
for
ma
too
soon
if
he
acts
peter
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
secret
cares
sara
ray
was
beginning
to
feel
worried
over
her
looks
i
heard
her
and
cecily
talking
over
their
troubles
one
evening
while
i
was
weeding
the
onion
bed
and
they
were
behind
the
hedge
knitting
lace
i
did
not
mean
to
eavesdrop
i
supposed
they
knew
i
was
there
until
cecily
overwhelmed
me
with
indignation
later
on
i
m
so
afraid
cecily
that
i
m
going
to
be
homely
all
my
life
said
poor
sara
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
you
can
stand
being
ugly
when
you
are
young
if
you
have
any
hope
of
being
better
looking
when
you
grow
up
but
i
m
getting
worse
aunt
mary
says
i
m
going
to
be
the
very
image
of
aunt
matilda
and
aunt
matilda
is
as
homely
as
she
can
be
it
isn
t
and
poor
sara
sighed
a
very
cheerful
prospect
if
i
am
ugly
nobody
will
ever
want
to
marry
me
and
concluded
sara
candidly
i
don
t
want
to
be
an
old
but
plenty
of
girls
get
married
who
aren
t
a
bit
pretty
comforted
cecily
besides
you
are
real
nice
looking
at
times
sara
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
a
nice
but
just
look
at
my
hands
moaned
sara
they
re
simply
covered
with
oh
the
warts
will
all
disappear
before
you
grow
up
said
cecily
but
they
won
t
disappear
before
the
school
concert
how
am
i
to
get
up
there
and
recite
you
know
there
is
one
line
in
my
recitation
she
waved
her
hand
and
i
have
to
wave
mine
when
i
say
it
fancy
waving
a
hand
all
covered
with
warts
i
ve
tried
every
remedy
i
ever
heard
of
but
nothing
does
any
good
judy
pineau
said
if
i
rubbed
them
with
it
would
take
them
away
for
sure
but
how
am
i
to
get
any
it
doesn
t
sound
like
a
very
nice
remedy
anyhow
shuddered
cecily
i
d
rather
have
the
warts
but
do
you
know
i
believe
if
you
didn
t
cry
so
much
over
every
little
thing
you
d
be
ever
so
much
better
looking
crying
spoils
your
eyes
and
makes
the
end
of
your
nose
i
can
t
help
crying
protested
sara
my
feelings
are
so
very
sensitive
i
ve
given
up
trying
to
keep
that
well
men
don
t
like
said
cecily
sagely
cecily
had
a
good
deal
of
mother
eve
s
wisdom
tucked
away
in
that
smooth
brown
head
of
hers
cecily
do
you
ever
intend
to
be
married
asked
sara
in
a
confidential
tone
goodness
cried
cecily
quite
shocked
it
will
be
time
enough
when
i
grow
up
to
think
of
that
i
should
think
you
d
have
to
think
of
it
now
with
cyrus
brisk
as
crazy
after
you
as
he
i
wish
cyrus
brisk
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
red
sea
exclaimed
cecily
goaded
into
a
spurt
of
temper
by
mention
of
the
detested
name
what
has
cyrus
been
doing
now
asked
felicity
coming
around
the
corner
of
the
hedge
doing
now
it
s
all
the
time
he
just
worries
me
to
death
returned
cecily
angrily
he
keeps
writing
me
letters
and
putting
them
in
my
desk
or
in
my
reader
i
never
answer
one
of
them
but
he
keeps
on
and
in
the
last
one
mind
you
he
said
he
d
do
something
desperate
right
off
if
i
wouldn
t
promise
to
marry
him
when
we
grew
just
think
cecily
you
ve
had
a
proposal
already
said
sara
ray
in
an
tone
but
he
hasn
t
done
anything
desperate
yet
and
that
was
last
week
commented
felicity
with
a
toss
of
her
head
he
sent
me
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
wanted
one
of
mine
in
exchange
continued
cecily
indignantly
i
tell
you
i
sent
his
back
to
him
pretty
did
you
never
answer
any
of
his
letters
asked
sara
ray
no
indeed
i
guess
not
do
you
know
said
felicity
i
believe
if
you
wrote
him
just
once
and
told
him
your
exact
opinion
of
him
in
good
plain
english
it
would
cure
him
of
his
i
couldn
t
do
that
i
haven
t
enough
spunk
confessed
cecily
with
a
blush
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
did
do
once
he
wrote
me
a
long
letter
last
week
it
was
just
awfully
soft
and
every
other
word
was
spelled
wrong
he
even
spelled
baking
soda
bacon
soda
what
on
earth
had
he
to
say
about
baking
soda
in
a
asked
felicity
oh
he
said
his
mother
sent
him
to
the
store
for
some
and
he
forgot
it
because
he
was
thinking
about
me
well
i
just
took
his
letter
and
wrote
in
all
the
words
spelled
right
above
the
wrong
ones
in
red
ink
just
as
perkins
makes
us
do
with
our
dictation
exercises
and
sent
it
back
to
him
i
thought
maybe
he
d
feel
insulted
and
stop
writing
to
and
did
he
no
he
didn
t
it
is
my
opinion
you
can
t
insult
cyrus
brisk
he
is
too
he
wrote
another
letter
and
thanked
me
for
correcting
his
mistakes
and
said
it
made
him
feel
glad
because
it
showed
i
was
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
him
when
i
wanted
him
to
spell
better
did
you
ever
miss
marwood
says
it
is
wrong
to
hate
anyone
but
i
don
t
care
i
hate
cyrus
mrs
cyrus
brisk
would
be
an
awful
name
giggled
felicity
flossie
brisk
says
cyrus
is
ruining
all
the
trees
on
his
father
s
place
cutting
your
name
on
them
said
sara
ray
his
father
told
him
he
would
whip
him
if
he
didn
t
stop
but
cyrus
keeps
right
on
he
told
flossie
it
relieved
his
feelings
flossie
says
he
cut
yours
and
his
together
on
the
birch
tree
in
front
of
the
parlour
window
and
a
row
of
hearts
around
just
where
every
visitor
can
see
them
i
suppose
lamented
cecily
he
just
worries
my
life
out
and
what
i
mind
most
of
all
is
he
sits
and
looks
at
me
in
school
with
such
melancholy
reproachful
eyes
when
he
ought
to
be
working
sums
i
won
t
look
at
him
but
i
feel
him
staring
at
me
and
it
makes
me
so
they
say
his
mother
was
out
of
her
mind
at
one
time
said
felicity
i
do
not
think
felicity
was
quite
well
pleased
that
cyrus
should
have
passed
over
her
prettiness
to
set
his
affections
on
that
demure
elf
of
a
cecily
she
did
not
want
the
allegiance
of
cyrus
in
the
least
but
it
was
something
of
a
slight
that
he
had
not
wanted
her
to
want
it
and
he
sends
me
pieces
of
poetry
he
cuts
out
of
the
papers
cecily
went
on
with
lots
of
the
lines
marked
with
a
lead
pencil
yesterday
he
put
one
in
his
letter
and
this
is
what
he
marked
if
you
will
not
relent
to
me
then
must
i
learn
to
know
darkness
alone
till
life
be
flown
here
i
have
the
piece
in
my
i
ll
read
it
all
to
those
three
graceless
girls
read
the
sentimental
rhyme
and
giggled
over
it
poor
cyrus
his
young
affections
were
sadly
misplaced
but
after
all
though
cecily
never
relented
towards
him
he
did
not
condemn
himself
to
darkness
alone
till
life
was
flown
quite
early
in
life
he
wedded
a
stout
rosy
buxom
lass
the
very
antithesis
of
his
first
love
he
prospered
in
his
undertakings
raised
a
large
and
respectable
family
and
was
eventually
appointed
a
justice
of
the
peace
which
was
all
very
sensible
of
cyrus

happened
right
along
cecily
declared
she
hated
to
go
to
sleep
for
fear
she
might
miss
something
there
were
so
many
dear
delights
along
the
golden
road
to
give
us
pleasure
the
earth
dappled
with
new
blossom
the
dance
of
shadows
in
the
fields
the
rustling
ways
of
the
woods
the
faint
fragrance
in
meadow
lanes
liltings
of
birds
and
croon
of
bees
in
the
old
orchard
windy
pipings
on
the
hills
sunset
behind
the
pines
limpid
dews
filling
primrose
cups
crescent
moons
through
darklings
boughs
soft
nights
alight
with
blinking
stars
we
enjoyed
all
these
boons
unthinkingly
and
as
children
do
and
besides
these
there
was
the
absorbing
little
drama
of
human
life
which
was
being
enacted
all
around
us
and
in
which
each
of
us
played
a
satisfying
part
the
gay
preparations
for
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
the
excitement
of
practising
for
the
concert
with
which
our
perkins
had
elected
to
close
the
school
year
and
cecily
s
troubles
with
cyrus
brisk
which
furnished
unholy
mirth
for
the
rest
of
us
though
cecily
could
not
see
the
funny
side
of
it
at
all
matters
went
from
bad
to
worse
in
the
case
of
the
irrepressible
cyrus
he
continued
to
shower
cecily
with
notes
the
spelling
of
which
showed
no
improvement
he
worried
the
life
out
of
her
by
constantly
threatening
to
fight
willy
fraser
although
as
felicity
sarcastically
pointed
out
he
never
did
it
but
i
m
always
afraid
he
will
said
cecily
and
it
would
be
such
a
disgrace
to
have
two
boys
fighting
over
me
in
you
must
have
encouraged
cyrus
a
little
in
the
beginning
or
he
d
never
have
been
so
persevering
said
felicity
unjustly
i
never
did
cried
outraged
cecily
you
know
very
well
felicity
king
that
i
hated
cyrus
brisk
ever
since
the
very
first
time
i
saw
his
big
fat
red
face
so
there
felicity
is
just
jealous
because
cyrus
didn
t
take
a
notion
to
her
instead
of
you
sis
said
dan
talk
sense
snapped
felicity
if
i
did
you
wouldn
t
understand
me
sweet
little
sister
rejoined
aggravating
dan
finally
cyrus
crowned
his
iniquities
by
stealing
the
denied
lock
of
cecily
s
hair
one
sunny
afternoon
in
school
cecily
and
kitty
marr
asked
and
received
permission
to
sit
out
on
the
side
bench
before
the
open
window
where
the
cool
breeze
swept
in
from
the
green
fields
beyond
to
sit
on
this
bench
was
always
considered
a
treat
and
was
only
allowed
as
a
reward
of
merit
but
cecily
and
kitty
had
another
reason
for
wishing
to
sit
there
kitty
had
read
in
a
magazine
that
were
good
for
the
hair
so
both
she
and
cecily
tossed
their
long
braids
over
the
and
let
them
hang
there
in
the
broiling
and
while
cecily
sat
thus
diligently
working
a
fraction
sum
on
her
slate
that
base
cyrus
asked
permission
to
go
out
having
previously
borrowed
a
pair
of
scissors
from
one
of
the
big
girls
who
did
fancy
work
at
the
noon
recess
outside
cyrus
sneaked
up
close
to
the
window
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
cecily
s
hair
this
rape
of
the
lock
did
not
produce
quite
such
terrible
consequences
as
the
more
famous
one
in
pope
s
poem
but
cecily
s
soul
was
no
less
agitated
than
belinda
s
she
cried
all
the
way
home
from
school
about
it
and
only
checked
her
tears
when
dan
declared
he
d
fight
cyrus
and
make
him
give
it
up
oh
no
you
mustn
said
cecily
struggling
with
her
sobs
i
won
t
have
you
fighting
on
my
account
for
anything
and
besides
he
d
likely
lick
you
he
s
so
big
and
rough
and
the
folks
at
home
might
find
out
all
about
it
and
uncle
roger
would
never
give
me
any
peace
and
mother
would
be
cross
for
she
d
never
believe
it
wasn
t
my
fault
it
wouldn
t
be
so
bad
if
he
d
only
taken
a
little
but
he
cut
a
great
big
chunk
right
off
the
end
of
one
of
the
braids
just
look
at
it
i
ll
have
to
cut
the
other
to
make
them
fair
and
they
ll
look
so
awful
but
cyrus
acquirement
of
the
chunk
of
hair
was
his
last
triumph
his
downfall
was
near
and
although
it
involved
cecily
in
a
most
humiliating
experience
over
which
she
cried
half
the
following
night
in
the
end
she
confessed
it
was
worth
undergoing
just
to
get
rid
of
cyrus
perkins
was
an
exceedingly
strict
disciplinarian
no
communication
of
any
sort
was
permitted
between
his
pupils
during
school
hours
anyone
caught
violating
this
rule
was
promptly
punished
by
the
infliction
of
one
of
the
weird
penances
for
which
perkins
was
famous
and
which
were
generally
far
worse
than
ordinary
whipping
one
day
in
school
cyrus
sent
a
letter
across
to
cecily
usually
he
left
his
effusions
in
her
desk
or
between
the
leaves
of
her
books
but
this
time
it
was
passed
over
to
her
under
cover
of
the
desk
through
the
hands
of
two
or
three
scholars
just
as
em
frewen
held
it
over
the
aisle
perkins
wheeled
around
from
his
station
before
the
blackboard
and
caught
her
in
the
act
bring
that
here
emmeline
he
commanded
cyrus
turned
quite
pale
em
carried
the
note
to
perkins
he
took
it
held
it
up
and
scrutinized
the
address
did
you
write
this
to
cecily
emmeline
he
asked
no
who
wrote
it
then
em
said
quite
shamelessly
that
she
didn
t
know
it
had
just
been
passed
over
from
the
next
row
and
i
suppose
you
have
no
idea
where
it
came
from
said
perkins
with
his
frightful
sardonic
grin
well
perhaps
cecily
can
tell
us
you
may
take
your
seat
emmeline
and
you
will
remain
at
the
foot
of
your
spelling
class
for
a
week
as
punishment
for
passing
the
note
cecily
come
indignant
em
sat
down
and
poor
innocent
cecily
was
haled
forth
to
public
ignominy
she
went
with
a
crimson
face
cecily
said
her
tormentor
do
you
know
who
wrote
this
letter
to
you
cecily
like
a
certain
renowned
personage
could
not
tell
a
lie
i
i
think
so
sir
she
murmured
faintly
who
was
it
i
can
t
tell
you
that
stammered
cecily
on
the
verge
of
tears
ah
said
perkins
politely
well
i
suppose
i
could
easily
find
out
by
opening
it
but
it
is
very
impolite
to
open
other
people
s
letters
i
think
i
have
a
better
plan
since
you
refuse
to
tell
me
who
wrote
it
open
it
yourself
take
this
chalk
and
copy
the
contents
on
the
blackboard
that
we
may
all
enjoy
them
and
sign
the
writer
s
name
at
the
oh
gasped
cecily
choosing
the
lesser
of
two
evils
i
ll
tell
you
who
wrote
it
it
was
hush
perkins
checked
her
with
a
gentle
motion
of
his
hand
he
was
always
most
gentle
when
most
inexorable
you
did
not
obey
me
when
i
first
ordered
you
to
tell
me
the
writer
you
can
not
have
the
privilege
of
doing
so
now
open
the
note
take
the
chalk
and
do
as
i
command
worms
will
turn
and
even
meek
mild
obedient
little
souls
like
cecily
may
be
goaded
to
the
point
of
wild
sheer
rebellion
i
i
won
t
she
cried
passionately
perkins
martinet
though
he
was
would
hardly
i
think
have
inflicted
such
a
punishment
on
cecily
who
was
a
favourite
of
his
had
he
known
the
real
nature
of
that
luckless
missive
but
as
he
afterwards
admitted
he
thought
it
was
merely
a
note
from
some
other
girl
of
such
trifling
sort
as
are
wont
to
write
and
moreover
he
had
already
committed
himself
to
the
decree
which
like
those
of
mede
and
persian
must
not
alter
to
let
cecily
off
after
her
mad
defiance
would
be
to
establish
a
revolutionary
precedent
so
you
really
think
you
won
t
he
queried
smilingly
well
on
second
thoughts
you
may
take
your
choice
either
you
will
do
as
i
have
bidden
you
or
you
will
sit
for
three
days
with
perkins
eye
skimmed
over
the
to
find
a
boy
who
was
sitting
alone
with
cyrus
this
choice
of
perkins
who
knew
nothing
of
the
little
drama
of
emotions
that
went
on
under
the
routine
of
lessons
and
exercises
in
his
domain
was
purely
accidental
but
we
took
it
at
the
time
as
a
stroke
of
diabolical
genius
it
left
cecily
no
choice
she
would
have
done
almost
anything
before
she
would
have
sat
with
cyrus
brisk
with
flashing
eyes
she
tore
open
the
letter
snatched
up
the
chalk
and
dashed
at
the
blackboard
in
a
few
minutes
the
contents
of
that
letter
graced
the
expanse
usually
sacred
to
more
prosaic
compositions
i
can
not
reproduce
it
verbatim
for
i
had
no
after
opportunity
of
refreshing
my
memory
but
i
remember
that
it
was
exceedingly
sentimental
and
exceedingly
for
cecily
mercilessly
copied
down
poor
cyrus
mistakes
he
wrote
her
that
he
wore
her
hare
over
his
hart
and
he
stole
it
cecily
threw
passionately
over
her
shoulder
at
perkins
that
her
eyes
were
so
sweet
and
lovely
that
he
couldn
t
find
words
nice
enuf
to
describ
them
that
he
could
never
forget
how
butiful
she
had
looked
in
prar
meeting
the
evening
before
and
that
some
meels
he
couldn
t
eat
for
thinking
of
her
with
more
to
the
same
effect
and
he
signed
it
yours
till
deth
us
do
part
cyrus
as
the
writing
proceeded
we
scholars
exploded
into
smothered
laughter
despite
our
awe
of
perkins
perkins
himself
could
not
keep
a
straight
face
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
but
we
could
see
his
shoulders
shaking
when
cecily
had
finished
and
had
thrown
down
the
chalk
with
bitter
vehemence
he
turned
around
with
a
very
red
face
that
will
do
you
may
sit
down
cyrus
since
it
seems
you
are
the
guilty
person
take
the
eraser
and
wipe
that
off
the
board
then
go
stand
in
the
corner
facing
the
room
and
hold
your
arms
straight
above
your
head
until
i
tell
you
to
take
them
cyrus
obeyed
and
cecily
fled
to
her
seat
and
wept
nor
did
perkins
meddle
with
her
more
that
day
she
bore
her
burden
of
humiliation
bitterly
for
several
days
until
she
was
suddenly
comforted
by
a
realization
that
cyrus
had
ceased
to
persecute
her
he
wrote
no
more
letters
he
gazed
no
longer
in
rapt
adoration
he
brought
no
more
votive
offerings
of
gum
and
pencils
to
her
shrine
at
first
we
thought
he
had
been
cured
by
the
unmerciful
chaffing
he
had
to
undergo
from
his
mates
but
eventually
his
sister
told
cecily
the
true
reason
cyrus
had
at
last
been
driven
to
believe
that
cecily
s
aversion
to
him
was
real
and
not
merely
the
defence
of
maiden
coyness
if
she
hated
him
so
intensely
that
she
would
rather
write
that
note
on
the
blackboard
than
sit
with
him
what
use
was
it
to
sigh
like
a
furnace
longer
for
her
perkins
had
blighted
love
s
young
dream
for
cyrus
with
a
killing
frost
thenceforth
sweet
cecily
kept
the
noiseless
tenor
of
her
way
unvexed
by
the
attentions
of
enamoured
swains

and
i
were
sitting
one
evening
on
the
mossy
stones
in
uncle
roger
s
hill

where
we
had
sat
the
morning
the
story
girl
told
us
the
tale
of
the
wedding
veil
of
the
proud
princess
but
it
was
evening
now
and
the
valley
beneath
us
was
brimmed
up
with
the
glow
of
the
afterlight
behind
us
two
tall
shapely
spruce
trees
rose
up
against
the
sunset
and
through
the
dark
oriel
of
their
sundered
branches
an
evening
star
looked
down
we
sat
on
a
little
strip
of
emerald
grassland
and
before
us
was
a
sloping
meadow
all
white
with
daisies
we
were
waiting
for
peter
and
the
story
girl
peter
had
gone
to
markdale
after
dinner
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
his
reunited
parents
because
it
was
his
birthday
he
had
left
us
grimly
determined
to
confess
to
his
father
the
dark
secret
of
his
presbyterianism
and
we
were
anxious
to
know
what
the
result
had
been
the
story
girl
had
gone
that
morning
with
miss
reade
to
visit
the
latter
s
home
near
charlottetown
and
we
expected
soon
to
see
her
coming
gaily
along
over
the
fields
from
the
armstrong
place
presently
peter
came
jauntily
stepping
along
the
field
path
up
the
hill
hasn
t
peter
got
tall
said
cecily
peter
is
growing
to
be
a
very
fine
looking
boy
decreed
felicity
i
notice
he
s
got
ever
so
much
handsomer
since
his
father
came
home
said
dan
with
a
killing
sarcasm
that
was
wholly
lost
on
felicity
who
gravely
responded
that
she
supposed
it
was
because
peter
felt
so
much
freer
from
care
and
responsibility
what
luck
peter
yelled
dan
as
soon
as
peter
was
within
earshot
everything
s
all
right
he
shouted
jubilantly
i
told
father
right
off
as
soon
as
i
got
home
he
added
when
he
reached
us
i
was
anxious
to
have
it
over
with
i
says
dad
there
s
something
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
and
i
don
t
know
how
you
ll
take
it
but
it
can
t
be
helped
i
says
dad
looked
pretty
sober
and
he
says
says
he
what
have
you
been
up
to
peter
don
t
be
afraid
to
tell
me
i
ve
been
forgiven
to
seventy
times
seven
so
surely
i
can
forgive
a
little
too
well
i
says
the
truth
is
father
i
m
a
presbyterian
i
made
up
my
mind
last
summer
the
time
of
the
judgment
day
that
i
d
be
a
presbyterian
and
i
ve
got
to
stick
to
it
i
m
sorry
i
can
t
be
a
methodist
like
you
and
mother
and
aunt
jane
but
i
can
t
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
i
says
then
i
waited
but
father
he
just
looked
relieved
and
he
says
says
he
goodness
boy
you
can
be
a
presbyterian
or
anything
else
you
like
so
long
as
it
s
protestant
i
m
not
caring
he
says
the
main
thing
is
that
you
must
be
good
and
do
what
s
i
tell
you
concluded
peter
emphatically
father
is
a
christian
all
well
i
suppose
your
mind
will
be
at
rest
now
said
felicity
what
s
that
you
have
in
your
buttonhole
that
s
a
clover
answered
peter
exultantly
that
means
good
luck
for
the
summer
i
found
it
in
markdale
there
ain
t
much
clover
in
carlisle
this
year
of
any
kind
of
leaf
the
crop
is
going
to
be
a
failure
your
uncle
roger
says
it
s
because
there
ain
t
enough
old
maids
in
carlisle
there
s
lots
of
them
in
markdale
and
that
s
the
reason
he
says
why
they
always
have
such
good
clover
crops
what
on
earth
have
old
maids
to
do
with
it
cried
cecily
i
don
t
believe
they
ve
a
single
thing
to
do
with
it
but
roger
says
they
have
and
he
says
a
man
called
darwin
proved
it
this
is
the
rigmarole
he
got
off
to
me
the
other
day
the
clover
crop
depends
on
there
being
plenty
of
because
they
are
the
only
insects
with
tongues
long
enough
to
to
fer
fertilize
i
think
he
called
it
the
blossoms
but
mice
eat
and
cats
eat
mice
and
old
maids
keep
cats
so
your
uncle
roger
says
the
more
old
maids
the
more
cats
and
the
more
cats
the
fewer
and
the
fewer
the
more
and
the
more
the
better
clover
so
don
t
worry
if
you
do
get
to
be
old
maids
girls
said
dan
remember
you
ll
be
helping
the
clover
i
never
heard
such
stuff
as
you
boys
talk
said
felicity
and
uncle
roger
is
no
there
comes
the
story
girl
cried
cecily
eagerly
now
we
ll
hear
all
about
beautiful
alice
s
the
story
girl
was
bombarded
with
eager
questions
as
soon
as
she
arrived
miss
reade
s
home
was
a
dream
of
a
place
it
appeared
the
house
was
just
covered
with
ivy
and
there
was
a
most
delightful
old
garden
and
added
the
story
girl
with
the
joy
of
a
connoisseur
who
has
found
a
rare
gem
the
sweetest
little
story
connected
with
it
and
i
saw
the
hero
of
the
story
where
was
the
heroine
queried
cecily
she
is
oh
of
course
she
d
have
to
die
exclaimed
dan
in
disgust
i
d
like
a
story
where
somebody
lived
once
in
i
ve
told
you
heaps
of
stories
where
people
lived
retorted
the
story
girl
if
this
heroine
hadn
t
died
there
wouldn
t
have
been
any
story
she
was
miss
reade
s
aunt
and
her
name
was
una
and
i
believe
she
must
have
been
just
like
miss
reade
herself
miss
reade
told
me
all
about
her
when
we
went
into
the
garden
i
saw
in
one
corner
of
it
an
old
stone
bench
arched
over
by
a
couple
of
pear
trees
and
all
grown
about
with
grass
and
violets
and
an
old
man
was
sitting
on
it
a
bent
old
man
with
long
hair
and
beautiful
sad
blue
eyes
he
seemed
very
lonely
and
sorrowful
and
i
wondered
that
miss
reade
didn
t
speak
to
him
but
she
never
let
on
she
saw
him
and
took
me
away
to
another
part
of
the
garden
after
awhile
he
got
up
and
went
away
and
then
miss
reade
said
come
over
to
aunt
una
s
seat
and
i
will
tell
you
about
her
and
her
lover
that
man
who
has
just
gone
oh
isn
t
he
too
old
for
a
lover
i
said
beautiful
alice
laughed
and
said
it
was
forty
years
since
he
had
been
her
aunt
una
s
lover
he
had
been
a
tall
handsome
young
man
then
and
her
aunt
una
was
a
beautiful
girl
of
nineteen
we
went
over
and
sat
down
and
miss
reade
told
me
all
about
her
she
said
that
when
she
was
a
child
she
had
heard
much
of
her
aunt
una
that
she
seemed
to
have
been
one
of
those
people
who
are
not
soon
forgotten
whose
personality
seems
to
linger
about
the
scenes
of
their
lives
long
after
they
have
passed
what
is
a
personality
is
it
another
word
for
ghost
asked
peter
no
said
the
story
girl
shortly
i
can
t
stop
in
a
story
to
explain
i
don
t
believe
you
know
what
it
is
yourself
said
felicity
the
story
girl
picked
up
her
hat
which
she
had
thrown
down
on
the
grass
and
placed
it
defiantly
on
her
brown
curls
i
m
going
in
she
announced
i
have
to
help
aunt
olivia
ice
a
cake
tonight
and
you
all
seem
more
interested
in
dictionaries
than
that
s
not
fair
i
exclaimed
dan
and
felix
and
sara
ray
and
cecily
and
i
have
never
said
a
word
it
s
mean
to
punish
us
for
what
peter
and
felicity
did
we
want
to
hear
the
rest
of
the
story
never
mind
what
a
personality
is
but
go
on
and
peter
you
young
ass
keep
i
only
wanted
to
know
muttered
peter
sulkily
i
do
know
what
personality
is
but
it
s
hard
to
explain
said
the
story
girl
relenting
it
s
what
makes
you
different
from
dan
peter
and
me
different
from
felicity
or
cecily
miss
reade
s
aunt
una
had
a
personality
that
was
very
uncommon
and
she
was
beautiful
too
with
white
skin
and
eyes
and
hair
a
moonlight
beauty
miss
reade
called
it
she
used
to
keep
a
kind
of
a
diary
and
miss
reade
s
mother
used
to
read
parts
of
it
to
her
she
wrote
verses
in
it
and
they
were
lovely
and
she
wrote
descriptions
of
the
old
garden
which
she
loved
very
much
miss
reade
said
that
everything
in
the
garden
plot
or
shrub
or
tree
recalled
to
her
mind
some
phrase
or
verse
of
her
aunt
una
s
so
that
the
whole
place
seemed
full
of
her
and
her
memory
haunted
the
walks
like
a
faint
sweet
perfume
una
had
as
i
ve
told
you
a
lover
and
they
were
to
have
been
married
on
her
twentieth
birthday
her
wedding
dress
was
to
have
been
a
gown
of
white
brocade
with
purple
violets
in
it
but
a
little
while
before
it
she
took
ill
with
fever
and
died
and
she
was
buried
on
her
birthday
instead
of
being
married
it
was
just
in
the
time
of
opening
roses
her
lover
has
been
faithful
to
her
ever
since
he
has
never
married
and
every
june
on
her
birthday
he
makes
a
pilgrimage
to
the
old
garden
and
sits
for
a
long
time
in
silence
on
the
bench
where
he
used
to
woo
her
on
crimson
eves
and
moonlight
nights
of
long
ago
miss
reade
says
she
always
loves
to
see
him
sitting
there
because
it
gives
her
such
a
deep
and
lasting
sense
of
the
beauty
and
strength
of
love
which
can
thus
outlive
time
and
death
and
sometimes
she
says
it
gives
her
a
little
eerie
feeling
too
as
if
her
aunt
una
were
really
sitting
there
beside
him
keeping
tryst
although
she
has
been
in
her
grave
for
forty
it
would
be
real
romantic
to
die
young
and
have
your
lover
make
a
pilgrimage
to
your
garden
every
year
reflected
sara
ray
it
would
be
more
comfortable
to
go
on
living
and
get
married
to
him
said
felicity
mother
says
all
those
sentimental
ideas
are
bosh
and
i
expect
they
are
it
s
a
wonder
beautiful
alice
hasn
t
a
beau
herself
she
is
so
pretty
and
the
carlisle
fellows
all
say
she
is
too
stuck
up
said
dan
there
s
nobody
in
carlisle
half
good
enough
for
her
cried
the
story
girl
except
except
who
asked
felix
never
mind
said
the
story
girl
mysteriously
chapter
xvii
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
what
a
delightful
wholesome
excitement
there
was
about
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
the
monday
and
tuesday
preceding
it
we
did
not
go
to
school
at
all
but
were
all
kept
home
to
do
chores
and
run
errands
the
cooking
and
decorating
and
arranging
that
went
on
those
two
days
was
amazing
and
felicity
was
so
happy
over
it
all
that
she
did
not
even
quarrel
with
dan
though
she
narrowly
escaped
it
when
he
told
her
that
the
governor
s
wife
was
coming
to
the
wedding
mind
you
have
some
of
her
favourite
rusks
for
her
he
said
i
guess
said
felicity
with
dignity
that
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
supper
will
be
good
enough
for
even
a
governor
s
i
s
pose
none
of
us
except
the
story
girl
will
get
to
the
first
table
said
felix
rather
gloomily
never
mind
comforted
felicity
there
s
a
whole
turkey
to
be
kept
for
us
and
a
freezerful
of
ice
cream
cecily
and
i
are
going
to
wait
on
the
tables
and
we
ll
put
away
a
little
of
everything
that
s
extra
nice
for
our
i
do
so
want
to
have
my
supper
with
you
sighed
sara
ray
but
i
s
pose
ma
will
drag
me
with
her
wherever
she
goes
she
won
t
trust
me
out
of
her
sight
a
minute
the
whole
evening
i
know
she
won
i
ll
get
aunt
olivia
to
ask
her
to
let
you
have
your
supper
with
us
said
cecily
she
can
t
refuse
the
bride
s
you
don
t
know
all
ma
can
do
returned
sara
darkly
no
i
feel
that
i
ll
have
to
eat
my
supper
with
her
but
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
very
thankful
i
m
to
get
to
the
wedding
at
all
and
that
ma
did
get
me
a
new
white
dress
for
it
even
yet
i
m
so
scared
something
will
happen
to
prevent
me
from
getting
to
monday
evening
shrouded
itself
in
clouds
and
all
night
long
the
voice
of
the
wind
answered
to
the
voice
of
the
rain
tuesday
the
downpour
continued
we
were
quite
frantic
about
it
suppose
it
kept
on
raining
over
wednesday
aunt
olivia
couldn
t
be
married
in
the
orchard
then
that
would
be
too
bad
especially
when
the
late
apple
tree
had
most
obligingly
kept
its
store
of
blossom
until
after
all
the
other
trees
had
faded
and
then
burst
lavishly
into
bloom
for
aunt
olivia
s
wedding
that
apple
tree
was
always
very
late
in
blooming
and
this
year
it
was
a
week
later
than
usual
it
was
a
sight
to
see
a
great
with
high
boughs
over
which
a
wealth
of
rosy
snow
seemed
to
have
been
flung
never
had
bride
a
more
magnificent
canopy
to
our
rapture
however
it
cleared
up
beautifully
tuesday
evening
and
the
sun
before
setting
in
purple
pomp
poured
a
flood
of
wonderful
radiance
over
the
whole
great
green
world
promising
a
fair
morrow
uncle
alec
drove
off
to
the
station
through
it
to
bring
home
the
bridegroom
and
his
best
man
dan
was
full
of
a
wild
idea
that
we
should
all
meet
them
at
the
gate
armed
with
cowbells
and
and
charivari
them
up
the
lane
peter
sided
with
him
but
the
rest
of
us
voted
down
the
suggestion
do
you
want
seton
to
think
we
are
a
pack
of
wild
indians
asked
felicity
severely
a
nice
opinion
he
d
have
of
our
manners
well
it
s
the
only
chance
we
ll
have
to
chivaree
them
grumbled
dan
aunt
olivia
wouldn
t
mind
she
can
take
a
ma
would
kill
you
if
you
did
such
a
thing
warned
felicity
dr
seton
lives
in
halifax
and
they
never
chivaree
people
there
he
would
think
it
very
then
he
should
have
stayed
in
halifax
and
got
married
there
retorted
dan
sulkily
we
were
very
curious
to
see
our
when
he
came
and
uncle
alec
took
him
into
the
parlour
we
were
all
crowded
into
the
dark
corner
behind
the
stairs
to
peep
at
him
then
we
fled
to
the
moonlight
world
outside
and
discussed
him
at
the
dairy
he
s
bald
said
cecily
disappointedly
and
rather
short
and
stout
said
felicity
he
s
forty
if
he
s
a
day
said
dan
never
you
mind
cried
the
story
girl
loyally
aunt
olivia
loves
him
with
all
her
and
more
than
that
he
s
got
lots
of
money
added
felicity
well
he
may
be
all
right
said
peter
but
it
s
my
opinion
that
your
aunt
olivia
could
have
done
just
as
well
on
the
your
opinion
doesn
t
matter
very
much
to
our
family
said
felicity
crushingly
but
when
we
made
the
acquaintance
of
seton
next
morning
we
liked
him
enormously
and
voted
him
a
jolly
good
fellow
even
peter
remarked
aside
to
me
that
he
guessed
miss
olivia
hadn
t
made
much
of
a
mistake
after
all
though
it
was
plain
he
thought
she
was
running
a
risk
in
not
sticking
to
the
island
the
girls
had
not
much
time
to
discuss
him
with
us
they
were
all
exceedingly
busy
and
whisked
about
at
such
a
rate
that
they
seemed
to
possess
the
power
of
being
in
half
a
dozen
places
at
once
the
importance
of
felicity
was
quite
terrible
but
after
dinner
came
a
lull
thank
goodness
everything
is
ready
at
last
breathed
felicity
devoutly
as
we
foregathered
for
a
brief
space
in
the
fir
wood
we
ve
nothing
more
to
do
now
but
get
dressed
it
s
really
a
serious
thing
to
have
a
wedding
in
the
i
have
a
note
from
sara
ray
said
cecily
judy
pineau
brought
it
up
when
she
brought
ray
s
spoons
just
let
me
read
it
to
you
dearest
cecily
a
dreadful
misfortune
has
happened
to
me
last
night
i
went
with
judy
to
water
the
cows
and
in
the
spruce
bush
we
found
a
wasps
nest
and
judy
thought
it
was
an
old
one
and
she
poked
it
with
a
stick
and
it
was
a
new
one
full
of
wasps
and
they
all
flew
out
and
stung
us
terribly
on
the
face
and
hands
my
face
is
all
swelled
up
and
i
can
hardly
see
out
of
one
eye
the
suffering
was
awful
but
i
didn
t
mind
that
as
much
as
being
scared
ma
wouldn
t
take
me
to
the
wedding
but
she
says
i
can
go
and
i
m
going
i
know
that
i
am
a
sight
but
it
isn
t
anything
catching
i
am
writing
this
so
that
you
won
t
get
a
shock
when
you
see
me
isn
t
it
so
strange
to
think
your
dear
aunt
olivia
is
going
away
how
you
will
miss
her
but
your
loss
will
be
her
gain
au
revoir
your
loving
chum
sara
that
poor
child
said
the
story
girl
well
all
i
hope
is
that
strangers
won
t
take
her
for
one
of
the
family
remarked
felicity
in
a
disgusted
tone
aunt
olivia
was
married
at
five
o
clock
in
the
orchard
under
the
late
apple
tree
it
was
a
pretty
scene
the
air
was
full
of
the
perfume
of
apple
bloom
and
the
bees
blundered
foolishly
and
delightfully
from
one
blossom
to
another
half
drunken
with
perfume
the
old
orchard
was
full
of
smiling
guests
in
wedding
garments
aunt
olivia
was
most
beautiful
amid
the
frost
of
her
bridal
veil
and
the
story
girl
in
an
unusually
long
white
dress
with
her
brown
curls
clubbed
up
behind
looked
so
tall
and
that
we
hardly
recognized
her
after
the
ceremony
during
which
sara
ray
cried
all
the
time
there
was
a
royal
wedding
supper
and
sara
ray
was
permitted
to
eat
her
share
of
the
feast
with
us
i
m
glad
i
was
stung
by
the
wasps
after
all
she
said
delightedly
if
i
hadn
t
been
ma
would
never
have
let
me
eat
with
you
she
just
got
tired
explaining
to
people
what
was
the
matter
with
my
face
and
so
she
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
i
know
i
look
awful
but
oh
wasn
t
the
bride
a
dream
we
missed
the
story
girl
who
of
course
had
to
have
her
supper
at
the
bridal
table
but
we
were
a
hilarious
little
crew
and
the
girls
had
nobly
kept
their
promise
to
save
for
us
by
the
time
the
last
table
was
cleared
away
aunt
olivia
and
our
new
uncle
were
ready
to
go
there
was
an
orgy
of
tears
and
leavetakings
and
then
they
drove
away
into
the
odorous
moonlight
night
dan
and
peter
pursued
them
down
the
lane
with
a
fiendish
din
of
bells
and
pans
much
to
felicity
s
wrath
but
aunt
olivia
and
uncle
robert
took
it
in
good
part
and
waved
their
hands
back
to
us
with
peals
of
laughter
they
re
just
that
pleased
with
themselves
that
they
wouldn
t
mind
if
there
was
an
earthquake
said
felix
grinning
it
s
been
splendid
and
exciting
and
everything
went
off
well
sighed
cecily
but
oh
dear
it
s
going
to
be
so
queer
and
lonesome
without
aunt
olivia
i
just
believe
i
ll
cry
all
you
re
tired
to
death
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
you
said
dan
returning
you
girls
have
worked
like
slaves
tomorrow
will
be
even
harder
said
felicity
comfortingly
everything
will
have
to
be
cleaned
up
and
put
peg
bowen
paid
us
a
call
the
next
day
and
was
regaled
with
a
feast
of
fat
things
left
over
from
the
supper
well
i
ve
had
all
i
can
eat
she
said
when
she
had
finished
and
brought
out
her
pipe
and
that
doesn
t
happen
to
me
every
day
there
ain
t
been
as
much
marrying
as
there
used
to
be
and
half
the
time
they
just
sneak
off
to
the
minister
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
it
and
get
married
without
any
wedding
or
supper
that
ain
t
the
king
way
though
and
so
olivia
s
gone
off
at
last
she
weren
t
in
any
hurry
but
they
tell
me
she
s
done
well
time

married
yourself

breath
over

she
departed
in
high
good
humour
over
her
repartee

sara
ray
on
the
doorstep
she
stopped
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter

her
face

sara
ray
helps
out
we
all
missed
aunt
olivia
greatly
she
had
been
so
merry
and
companionable
and
had
possessed
such
a
knack
of
understanding
small
fry
but
youth
quickly
adapts
itself
to
changed
conditions
in
a
few
weeks
it
seemed
as
if
the
story
girl
had
always
been
living
at
uncle
alec
s
and
as
if
uncle
roger
had
always
had
a
fat
jolly
housekeeper
with
a
double
chin
and
little
twinkling
blue
eyes
i
don
t
think
aunt
janet
ever
quite
got
over
missing
aunt
olivia
or
looked
upon
hawkins
as
anything
but
a
necessary
evil
but
life
resumed
its
even
tenor
on
the
king
farm
broken
only
by
the
ripples
of
excitement
over
the
school
concert
and
letters
from
aunt
olivia
describing
her
trip
through
the
land
of
evangeline
we
incorporated
the
letters
in
our
magazine
under
the
heading
from
our
special
correspondent
and
were
very
proud
of
them
at
the
end
of
june
our
school
concert
came
off
and
was
a
great
event
in
our
young
lives
it
was
the
first
appearance
of
most
of
us
on
any
platform
and
some
of
us
were
very
nervous
we
all
had
recitations
except
dan
who
had
refused
flatly
to
take
any
part
and
was
consequently
i
m
sure
i
shall
die
when
i
find
myself
up
on
that
platform
facing
people
sighed
sara
ray
as
we
talked
the
affair
over
in
uncle
stephen
s
walk
the
night
before
the
concert
i
m
afraid
i
ll
faint
was
cecily
s
more
moderate
foreboding
i
m
not
one
single
bit
nervous
said
felicity
complacently
i
m
not
nervous
this
time
said
the
story
girl
but
the
first
time
i
recited
i
my
aunt
jane
remarked
peter
used
to
say
that
an
old
teacher
of
hers
told
her
that
when
she
was
going
to
recite
or
speak
in
public
she
must
just
get
it
firmly
into
her
mind
that
it
was
only
a
lot
of
cabbage
heads
she
had
before
her
and
she
wouldn
t
be
one
mightn
t
be
nervous
but
i
don
t
think
there
would
be
much
inspiration
in
reciting
to
cabbage
heads
said
the
story
girl
decidedly
i
want
to
recite
to
people
and
see
them
looking
interested
and
if
i
can
only
get
through
my
piece
without
breaking
down
i
don
t
care
whether
i
thrill
people
or
not
said
sara
ray
i
m
afraid
i
ll
forget
mine
and
get
stuck
foreboded
felix
some
of
you
fellows
be
sure
and
prompt
me
if
i
do
and
do
it
quick
so
s
i
won
t
get
worse
i
know
one
thing
said
cecily
resolutely
and
that
is
i
m
going
to
curl
my
hair
for
night
i
ve
never
curled
it
since
peter
almost
died
but
i
simply
must
tomorrow
night
for
all
the
other
girls
are
going
to
have
theirs
in
the
dew
and
heat
will
take
all
the
curl
out
of
yours
and
then
you
ll
look
like
a
scarecrow
warned
felicity
no
i
won
t
i
m
going
to
put
my
hair
up
in
paper
tonight
and
wet
it
with
a
that
judy
pineau
uses
sara
brought
me
up
a
bottle
of
it
judy
says
it
is
great
stuff
your
hair
will
keep
in
curl
for
days
no
matter
how
damp
the
weather
is
i
ll
leave
my
hair
in
the
papers
till
tomorrow
evening
and
then
i
ll
have
beautiful
you
d
better
leave
your
hair
alone
said
dan
gruffly
smooth
hair
is
better
than
a
lot
of
but
cecily
was
not
to
be
persuaded
curls
she
craved
and
curls
she
meant
to
have
i
m
thankful
my
warts
have
all
gone
said
sara
ray
so
they
have
exclaimed
felicity
did
you
try
peg
s
recipe
yes
i
didn
t
believe
in
it
but
i
tried
it
for
the
first
few
days
afterwards
i
kept
watching
my
warts
but
they
didn
t
go
away
and
then
i
gave
up
and
forgot
them
but
one
day
last
week
i
just
happened
to
look
at
my
hands
and
there
wasn
t
a
wart
to
be
seen
it
was
the
most
amazing
and
yet
you
ll
say
peg
bowen
isn
t
a
witch
said
peter
pshaw
it
was
just
the
potato
juice
scoffed
dan
it
was
a
dry
old
potato
i
had
and
there
wasn
t
much
juice
in
it
said
sara
ray
one
hardly
knows
what
to
believe
but
one
thing
is
certain
my
warts
are
cecily
put
her
hair
up
in
that
night
thoroughly
soaked
in
judy
pineau
s
it
was
a
nasty
job
for
the
fluid
was
very
sticky
but
cecily
persevered
and
got
it
done
then
she
went
to
bed
with
a
towel
tied
over
her
head
to
protect
the
pillow
she
did
not
sleep
well
and
had
uncanny
dreams
but
she
came
down
to
breakfast
with
an
expression
of
triumph
the
story
girl
examined
her
head
critically
and
said
cecily
if
i
were
you
i
d
take
those
papers
out
this
oh
no
if
i
do
my
hair
will
be
straight
again
by
night
i
mean
to
leave
them
in
till
the
last
i
wouldn
t
do
that
i
really
wouldn
t
persisted
the
story
girl
if
you
do
your
hair
will
be
too
curly
and
all
bushy
and
cecily
finally
yielded
and
went
upstairs
with
the
story
girl
presently
we
heard
a
little
shriek
then
two
little
shrieks
then
three
then
felicity
came
flying
down
and
called
her
mother
aunt
janet
went
up
and
presently
came
down
again
with
a
grim
mouth
she
filled
a
large
pan
with
warm
water
and
carried
it
upstairs
we
dared
ask
her
no
questions
but
when
felicity
came
down
to
wash
the
dishes
we
bombarded
her
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
cecily
demanded
dan
is
she
sick
no
she
isn
t
i
warned
her
not
to
put
her
hair
in
curls
but
she
wouldn
t
listen
to
me
i
guess
she
wishes
she
had
now
when
people
haven
t
natural
curly
hair
they
shouldn
t
try
to
make
it
curly
they
get
punished
if
they
look
here
felicity
never
mind
all
that
just
tell
us
what
has
happened
well
this
is
what
has
happened
her
that
ninny
of
a
sara
ray
brought
up
a
bottle
of
mucilage
instead
of
judy
s
and
cecily
put
her
hair
up
with
that
it
s
in
an
awful
good
gracious
exclaimed
dan
look
here
will
she
ever
get
it
out
goodness
knows
she
s
got
her
head
in
soak
now
her
hair
is
just
matted
together
hard
as
a
board
that
s
what
comes
of
vanity
said
felicity
than
whom
no
vainer
girl
existed
poor
cecily
paid
dearly
enough
for
her
vanity
she
spent
a
bad
forenoon
made
no
easier
by
her
mother
s
severe
rebukes
for
an
hour
she
soaked
her
head
that
is
she
stood
over
a
panful
of
warm
water
and
kept
dipping
her
head
in
with
tightly
shut
eyes
finally
her
hair
softened
sufficiently
to
be
disentangled
from
the
curl
papers
and
then
aunt
janet
subjected
it
to
a
merciless
shampoo
eventually
they
got
all
the
mucilage
washed
out
of
it
and
cecily
spent
the
remainder
of
the
forenoon
sitting
before
the
open
oven
door
in
the
hot
kitchen
drying
her
tresses
she
felt
very
her
hair
was
of
that
order
which
glossy
and
smooth
normally
is
dry
and
harsh
and
lustreless
for
several
days
after
being
shampooed
i
ll
look
like
a
fright
tonight
said
the
poor
child
to
me
with
trembling
voice
the
ends
will
be
sticking
out
all
over
my
sara
ray
is
a
perfect
idiot
i
said
wrathfully
oh
don
t
be
hard
on
poor
sara
she
didn
t
mean
to
bring
me
mucilage
it
s
really
all
my
own
fault
i
know
i
made
a
solemn
vow
when
peter
was
dying
that
i
would
never
curl
my
hair
again
and
i
should
have
kept
it
it
isn
t
right
to
break
solemn
vows
but
my
hair
will
look
like
dried
hay
poor
sara
ray
was
quite
overwhelmed
when
she
came
up
and
found
what
she
had
done
felicity
was
very
hard
on
her
and
aunt
janet
was
coldly
disapproving
but
sweet
cecily
forgave
her
unreservedly
and
they
walked
to
the
school
that
night
with
their
arms
about
each
other
s
waists
as
usual
the
was
crowded
with
friends
and
neighbours
perkins
was
flying
about
getting
things
into
readiness
and
miss
reade
who
was
the
organist
of
the
evening
was
sitting
on
the
platform
looking
her
sweetest
and
prettiest
she
wore
a
delightful
white
lace
hat
with
a
fetching
little
wreath
of
tiny
around
the
brim
a
white
muslin
dress
with
sprays
of
blue
violets
scattered
over
it
and
a
black
lace
scarf
doesn
t
she
look
angelic
said
cecily
rapturously
mind
you
said
sara
ray
the
awkward
man
is
here
in
the
corner
behind
the
door
i
never
remember
seeing
him
at
a
concert
i
suppose
he
came
to
hear
the
story
girl
recite
said
felicity
he
is
such
a
friend
of
the
concert
went
off
very
well
dialogues
choruses
and
recitations
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
felix
got
through
his
without
getting
stuck
and
peter
did
excellently
though
he
stuffed
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
a
habit
of
which
perkins
had
vainly
tried
to
break
him
peter
s
recitation
was
one
greatly
in
vogue
at
that
time
beginning
my
name
is
norval
on
the
grampian
hills
my
father
feeds
his
at
our
first
practice
peter
had
started
gaily
in
rushing
through
the
first
line
with
no
thought
whatever
of
punctuation
my
name
is
norval
on
the
grampian
stop
stop
peter
quoth
perkins
sarcastically
your
name
might
be
norval
if
you
were
never
on
the
grampian
hills
there
s
a
in
that
line
i
wish
you
to
peter
did
remember
it
cecily
neither
fainted
nor
failed
when
it
came
her
turn
she
recited
her
little
piece
very
well
though
somewhat
mechanically
i
think
she
really
did
much
better
than
if
she
had
had
her
desired
curls
the
miserable
conviction
that
her
hair
alone
among
that
bevy
was
looking
badly
quite
blotted
out
all
nervousness
and
from
her
mind
her
hair
apart
she
looked
very
pretty
the
prevailing
excitement
had
made
bright
her
eye
and
flushed
her
cheeks
rosily
too
rosily
perhaps
i
heard
a
carlisle
woman
behind
me
whisper
that
cecily
king
looked
consumptive
just
like
her
aunt
felicity
and
i
hated
her
fiercely
for
it
sara
ray
also
managed
to
get
through
respectably
although
she
was
pitiably
nervous
her
bow
was
naught
but
a
short
nod
as
if
her
head
worked
on
wires
whispered
felicity
uncharitably
and
the
wave
of
her
hand
more
nearly
resembled
an
agonized
jerk
than
a
wave
we
all
felt
relieved
when
she
finished
she
was
in
a
sense
one
of
our
crowd
and
we
had
been
afraid
she
would
disgrace
us
by
breaking
down
felicity
followed
her
and
recited
her
selection
without
haste
without
rest
and
absolutely
without
any
expression
whatever
but
what
mattered
it
how
she
recited
to
look
at
her
was
sufficient
what
with
her
splendid
fleece
of
golden
curls
her
great
brilliant
blue
eyes
her
exquisitely
tinted
face
her
dimpled
hands
and
arms
every
member
of
the
audience
must
have
felt
it
was
worth
the
ten
cents
he
had
paid
merely
to
see
her
the
story
girl
followed
an
expectant
silence
fell
over
the
room
and
perkins
face
lost
the
look
of
tense
anxiety
it
had
worn
all
the
evening
here
was
a
performer
who
could
be
depended
on
no
need
to
fear
stage
fright
or
forgetfulness
on
her
part
the
story
girl
was
not
looking
her
best
that
night
white
never
became
her
and
her
face
was
pale
though
her
eyes
were
splendid
but
nobody
thought
about
her
appearance
when
the
power
and
magic
of
her
voice
caught
and
held
her
listeners
spellbound
her
recitation
was
an
old
one
figuring
in
one
of
the
school
readers
and
we
scholars
all
knew
it
off
by
heart
sara
ray
alone
had
not
heard
the
story
girl
recite
it
the
latter
had
not
been
drilled
at
practices
as
had
the
other
pupils
perkins
choosing
not
to
waste
time
teaching
her
what
she
already
knew
far
better
than
he
did
the
only
time
she
had
recited
it
had
been
at
the
dress
rehearsal
two
nights
before
at
which
sara
ray
had
not
been
present
in
the
poem
a
florentine
lady
of
old
time
wedded
to
a
cold
and
cruel
husband
had
died
or
was
supposed
to
have
died
and
had
been
carried
to
the
rich
the
beautiful
the
dreadful
tomb
of
her
proud
family
in
the
night
she
wakened
from
her
trance
and
made
her
escape
chilled
and
terrified
she
had
made
her
way
to
her
husband
s
door
only
to
be
driven
away
brutally
as
a
restless
ghost
by
the
inmates
a
similar
reception
awaited
her
at
her
father
s
then
she
had
wandered
blindly
through
the
streets
of
florence
until
she
had
fallen
exhausted
at
the
door
of
the
lover
of
her
girlhood
he
unafraid
had
taken
her
in
and
cared
for
her
on
the
morrow
the
husband
and
father
having
discovered
the
empty
tomb
came
to
claim
her
she
refused
to
return
to
them
and
the
case
was
carried
to
the
court
of
law
the
verdict
given
was
that
a
woman
who
had
been
to
burial
borne
and
left
for
dead
who
had
been
driven
from
her
husband
s
door
and
from
her
childhood
home
must
be
adjudged
as
dead
in
law
and
fact
was
no
more
daughter
or
wife
but
was
set
free
to
form
what
new
ties
she
would
the
climax
of
the
whole
selection
came
in
the
line
the
court
pronounces
the
defendant
dead
and
the
story
girl
was
wont
to
render
it
with
such
dramatic
intensity
and
power
that
the
veriest
dullard
among
her
listeners
could
not
have
missed
its
force
and
significance
she
swept
along
through
the
poem
royally
playing
on
the
emotions
of
her
audience
as
she
had
so
often
played
on
ours
in
the
old
orchard
pity
terror
indignation
suspense
possessed
her
hearers
in
turn
in
the
court
scene
she
surpassed
herself
she
was
in
very
truth
the
florentine
judge
stern
stately
impassive
her
voice
dropped
into
the
solemnity
of
the
line
the
court
pronounces
the
defendant
she
paused
for
a
breathless
moment
the
better
to
bring
out
the
tragic
import
of
the
last
word
dead
piped
up
sara
ray
in
her
shrill
plaintive
little
voice
the
effect
to
use
a
hackneyed
but
convenient
phrase
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
instead
of
the
sigh
of
relieved
tension
that
should
have
swept
over
the
audience
at
the
conclusion
of
the
line
a
burst
of
laughter
greeted
it
the
story
girl
s
performance
was
completely
spoiled
she
dealt
the
luckless
sara
a
glance
that
would
have
slain
her
on
the
spot
could
glances
kill
stumbled
lamely
and
impotently
through
the
few
remaining
lines
of
her
recitation
and
fled
with
crimson
cheeks
to
hide
her
mortification
in
the
little
corner
that
had
been
curtained
off
for
a
perkins
looked
things
not
lawful
to
be
uttered
and
the
audience
tittered
at
intervals
for
the
rest
of
the
performance
sara
ray
alone
remained
serenely
satisfied
until
the
close
of
the
concert
when
we
surrounded
her
with
a
whirlwind
of
reproaches
why
she
stammered
aghast
what
did
i
do
i
i
thought
she
was
stuck
and
that
i
ought
to
prompt
her
you
little
fool
she
just
paused
for
effect
cried
felicity
angrily
felicity
might
be
rather
jealous
of
the
story
girl
s
gift
but
she
was
furious
at
beholding
one
of
our
family
made
ridiculous
in
such
a
fashion
you
have
less
sense
than
anyone
i
ever
heard
of
sara
poor
sara
dissolved
in
tears
i
didn
t
know
i
thought
she
was
stuck
she
wailed
again
she
cried
all
the
way
home
but
we
did
not
try
to
comfort
her
we
felt
quite
out
of
patience
with
her
even
cecily
was
seriously
annoyed
this
second
blunder
of
sara
s
was
too
much
even
for
her
loyalty
we
saw
her
turn
in
at
her
own
gate
and
go
sobbing
up
her
lane
with
no
relenting
the
story
girl
was
home
before
us
having
fled
from
the
schoolhouse
as
soon
as
the
programme
was
over
we
tried
to
sympathize
with
her
but
she
would
not
be
sympathized
with
please
don
t
ever
mention
it
to
me
again
she
said
with
compressed
lips
i
never
want
to
be
reminded
of
it
oh
that
little
idiot
she
spoiled
peter
s
sermon
last
summer
and
now
she
s
spoiled
your
recitation
said
felicity
i
think
it
s
time
we
gave
up
associating
with
sara
oh
don
t
be
quite
so
hard
on
her
pleaded
cecily
think
of
the
life
the
poor
child
has
to
live
at
home
i
know
she
ll
cry
all
oh
let
s
go
to
bed
growled
dan
i
m
good
and
ready
for
it
i
ve
had
enough
of
school
chapter
xix
by
way
of
the
stars
but
for
two
of
us
the
adventures
of
the
night
were
not
yet
over
silence
settled
down
over
the
old
house
the
eerie
whisperful
creeping
silence
of
night
felix
and
dan
were
already
sound
asleep
i
was
drifting
near
the
coast
o
dreams
when
i
was
aroused
by
a
light
tap
on
the
door
bev
are
you
asleep
came
in
the
story
girl
s
whisper
no
what
is
it
get
up
and
dress
and
come
out
i
want
with
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
and
some
misgiving
i
obeyed
what
was
in
the
wind
now
outside
in
the
hall
i
found
the
story
girl
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
her
hat
and
jacket
where
are
you
going
i
whispered
in
amazement
hush
i
ve
got
to
go
to
the
school
and
you
must
come
with
me
i
left
my
coral
necklace
there
the
clasp
came
loose
and
i
was
so
afraid
i
d
lose
it
that
i
took
it
off
and
put
it
in
the
bookcase
i
was
feeling
so
upset
when
the
concert
was
over
that
i
forgot
all
about
the
coral
necklace
was
a
very
handsome
one
which
had
belonged
to
the
story
girl
s
mother
she
had
never
been
permitted
to
wear
it
before
and
it
had
only
been
by
dint
of
much
coaxing
that
she
had
induced
aunt
janet
to
let
her
wear
it
to
the
concert
but
there
s
no
sense
in
going
for
it
in
the
dead
of
night
i
objected
it
will
be
quite
safe
you
can
go
for
it
in
the
lizzie
paxton
and
her
daughter
are
going
to
clean
the
school
tomorrow
and
i
heard
lizzie
say
tonight
she
meant
to
be
at
it
by
five
o
clock
to
get
through
before
the
heat
of
the
day
you
know
perfectly
well
what
liz
paxton
s
reputation
is
if
she
finds
that
necklace
i
ll
never
see
it
again
besides
if
i
wait
till
the
morning
aunt
janet
may
find
out
that
i
left
it
there
and
she
d
never
let
me
wear
it
again
no
i
m
going
for
it
now
if
you
re
afraid
added
the
story
girl
with
delicate
scorn
of
course
you
needn
t
afraid
i
d
show
her
come
on
i
said
we
slipped
out
of
the
house
noiselessly
and
found
ourselves
in
the
unutterable
solemnity
and
strangeness
of
a
dark
night
it
was
a
new
experience
and
our
hearts
thrilled
and
our
nerves
tingled
to
the
charm
of
it
never
had
we
been
abroad
before
at
such
an
hour
the
world
around
us
was
not
the
world
of
daylight
twas
an
alien
place
full
of
weird
evasive
enchantment
and
magicry
only
in
the
country
can
one
become
truly
acquainted
with
the
night
there
it
has
the
solemn
calm
of
the
infinite
the
dim
wide
fields
lie
in
silence
wrapped
in
the
holy
mystery
of
darkness
a
wind
loosened
from
wild
places
far
away
steals
out
to
blow
over
dewy
immemorial
hills
the
air
in
the
pastures
is
sweet
with
the
hush
of
dreams
and
one
may
rest
here
like
a
child
on
its
mother
s
breast
isn
t
it
wonderful
breathed
the
story
girl
as
we
went
down
the
long
hill
do
you
know
i
can
forgive
sara
ray
now
i
thought
tonight
i
never
could
but
now
it
doesn
t
matter
any
more
i
can
even
see
how
funny
it
was
oh
wasn
t
it
funny
dead
in
that
squeaky
little
voice
of
sara
s
i
ll
just
behave
to
her
tomorrow
as
if
nothing
had
happened
it
seems
so
long
ago
now
here
in
the
neither
of
us
ever
forgot
the
subtle
delight
of
that
stolen
walk
a
spell
of
glamour
was
over
us
the
breezes
whispered
strange
secrets
of
glens
and
the
hollows
where
the
ferns
grew
were
brimmed
with
mystery
and
romance
ghostlike
scents
crept
out
of
the
meadows
to
meet
us
and
the
fir
wood
before
we
came
to
the
church
was
a
living
sweetness
of
junebells
growing
in
abundance
junebells
have
another
and
more
scientific
name
of
course
but
who
could
desire
a
better
name
than
junebells
they
are
so
perfect
in
their
way
that
they
seem
to
epitomize
the
very
scent
and
charm
of
the
forest
as
if
the
old
wood
s
daintiest
thoughts
had
materialized
in
blossom
and
not
all
the
roses
by
bendameer
s
stream
are
as
fragrant
as
a
shallow
sheet
of
junebells
under
the
boughs
of
fir
there
were
fireflies
abroad
that
night
too
increasing
the
gramarye
of
it
there
is
certainly
something
a
little
supernatural
about
fireflies
nobody
pretends
to
understand
them
they
are
akin
to
the
tribes
of
fairy
survivals
of
the
elder
time
when
the
woods
and
hills
swarmed
with
the
little
green
folk
it
is
still
very
easy
to
believe
in
fairies
when
you
see
those
goblin
lanterns
glimmering
among
the
fir
tassels
isn
t
it
beautiful
said
the
story
girl
in
rapture
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
it
for
anything
i
m
glad
i
left
my
necklace
and
i
am
glad
you
are
with
me
bev
the
others
wouldn
t
understand
so
well
i
like
you
because
i
don
t
have
to
talk
to
you
all
the
time
it
s
so
nice
to
walk
with
someone
you
don
t
have
to
talk
to
here
is
the
graveyard
are
you
frightened
to
pass
it
bev
no
i
don
t
think
i
m
frightened
i
answered
slowly
but
i
have
a
queer
so
have
i
but
it
isn
t
fear
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
i
feel
as
if
something
was
reaching
out
of
the
graveyard
to
hold
me
something
that
wanted
life
i
don
t
like
it
let
s
hurry
but
isn
t
it
strange
to
think
of
all
the
dead
people
in
there
who
were
once
alive
like
you
and
me
i
don
t
feel
as
if
i
could
ever
die
do
you
no
but
everybody
must
of
course
we
go
on
living
afterwards
just
the
same
don
t
let
s
talk
of
such
things
here
i
said
hurriedly
when
we
reached
the
school
i
contrived
to
open
a
window
we
scrambled
in
lighted
a
lamp
and
found
the
missing
necklace
the
story
girl
stood
on
the
platform
and
gave
an
imitation
of
the
catastrophe
of
the
evening
that
made
me
shout
with
laughter
we
prowled
around
for
sheer
delight
over
being
there
at
an
unearthly
hour
when
everybody
supposed
we
were
sound
asleep
in
our
beds
it
was
with
regret
that
we
left
and
we
walked
home
as
slowly
as
we
could
to
prolong
the
adventure
let
s
never
tell
anyone
said
the
story
girl
as
we
reached
home
let
s
just
have
it
as
a
secret
between
us
for
ever
and
ever
something
that
nobody
else
knows
a
thing
about
but
you
and
we
d
better
keep
it
a
secret
from
aunt
janet
anyhow
i
whispered
laughing
she
d
think
we
were
both
it
s
real
jolly
to
be
crazy
once
in
a
while
said
the
story
girl
chapter
xx
extracts
from
our
magazine
editorial
as
will
be
seen
there
is
no
honour
roll
in
this
number
even
felicity
has
thought
all
the
beautiful
thoughts
that
can
be
thought
and
can
not
think
any
more
peter
has
never
got
drunk
but
under
existing
circumstances
that
is
not
greatly
to
his
credit
as
for
our
written
resolutions
they
have
silently
disappeared
from
our
chamber
walls
and
the
place
that
once
knew
them
knows
them
no
more
for
ever
peter
perplexedly
seems
to
me
i
ve
heard
something
like
that
it
is
very
sad
but
we
will
all
make
some
new
resolutions
next
year
and
maybe
it
will
be
easier
to
keep
those
the
story
of
the
locket
that
was
baked
this
was
a
story
my
aunt
jane
told
me
about
her
granma
when
she
was
a
little
girl
its
funny
to
think
of
baking
a
locket
but
it
wasn
t
to
eat
she
was
my
great
granma
but
ill
call
her
granma
for
short
it
happened
when
she
was
ten
years
old
of
course
she
wasent
anybodys
granma
then
her
father
and
mother
and
her
were
living
in
a
new
settlement
called
brinsley
their
nearest
naybor
was
a
mile
away
one
day
her
aunt
hannah
from
charlottetown
came
and
wanted
her
ma
to
go
visiting
with
her
at
first
granma
s
ma
thought
she
couldent
go
because
it
was
baking
day
and
granma
s
pa
was
away
but
granma
wasent
afraid
to
stay
alone
and
she
knew
how
to
bake
the
bread
so
she
made
her
ma
go
and
her
aunt
hannah
took
off
the
handsome
gold
locket
and
chain
she
was
waring
round
her
neck
and
hung
it
on
granmas
and
told
her
she
could
ware
it
all
day
granma
was
awful
pleased
for
she
had
never
had
any
jewelry
she
did
all
the
chores
and
then
was
needing
the
loaves
when
she
looked
up
and
saw
a
tramp
coming
in
and
he
was
an
awful
villenus
looking
tramp
he
dident
even
pass
the
time
of
day
but
just
set
down
on
a
chair
poor
granma
was
awful
fritened
and
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
went
on
needing
the
loaf
cold
and
trembling
that
is
granma
was
trembling
not
the
loaf
she
was
worried
about
the
locket
she
didn
t
know
how
she
could
hide
it
for
to
get
anywhere
she
would
have
to
turn
round
and
pass
him
all
of
a
suddent
she
thought
she
would
hide
it
in
the
bread
she
put
her
hand
up
and
pulled
it
hard
and
quick
and
broke
the
fastening
and
needed
it
right
into
the
loaf
then
she
put
the
loaf
in
the
pan
and
set
it
in
the
oven
the
tramp
hadent
seen
her
do
it
and
then
he
asked
for
something
to
eat
granma
got
him
up
a
meal
and
when
hed
et
it
he
began
prowling
about
the
kitchen
looking
into
everything
and
opening
the
cubbord
doors
then
he
went
into
granma
s
mas
room
and
turned
the
buro
drawers
and
trunk
inside
out
and
threw
the
things
in
them
all
about
all
he
found
was
a
purse
with
a
dollar
in
it
and
he
swore
about
it
and
took
it
and
went
away
when
granma
was
sure
he
was
really
gone
she
broke
down
and
cried
she
forgot
all
about
the
bread
and
it
burned
as
black
as
coal
when
she
smelled
it
burning
granma
run
and
pulled
it
out
she
was
awful
scared
the
locket
was
spoiled
but
she
sawed
open
the
loaf
and
it
was
there
safe
and
sound
when
her
aunt
hannah
came
back
she
said
granma
deserved
the
locket
because
she
had
saved
it
so
clever
and
she
gave
it
to
her
and
grandma
always
wore
it
and
was
very
proud
of
it
and
granma
used
to
say
that
was
the
only
loaf
of
bread
she
ever
spoiled
in
her
life
peter
craig
felicity
those
stories
are
all
very
well
but
they
are
only
true
stories
it
s
easy
enough
to
write
true
stories
i
thought
peter
was
appointed
fiction
editor
but
he
has
never
written
any
fiction
since
the
paper
started
that
s
not
my
idea
of
a
fiction
editor
he
ought
to
make
up
stories
out
of
his
own
peter
spunkily
i
can
do
it
too
and
i
will
next
time
and
it
ain
t
easier
to
write
true
stories
it
s
harder
cause
you
have
to
stick
to
felicity
i
don
t
believe
you
could
make
up
a
peter
i
ll
show
you
my
most
exciting
adventure
it
s
my
turn
to
write
it
but
i
m
so
nervous
my
worst
adventure
happened
two
years
ago
it
was
an
awful
one
i
had
a
striped
ribbon
striped
brown
and
yellow
and
i
lost
it
i
was
very
sorry
for
it
was
a
handsome
ribbon
and
all
the
girls
in
school
were
jealous
of
it
felicity
i
wasn
t
i
didn
t
think
it
one
bit
cecily
hush
i
hunted
everywhere
but
i
couldn
t
find
it
next
day
was
sunday
and
i
was
running
into
the
house
by
the
front
door
and
i
saw
something
lying
on
the
step
and
i
thought
it
was
my
ribbon
and
i
made
a
grab
at
it
as
i
passed
but
oh
it
was
a
snake
oh
i
can
never
describe
how
i
felt
when
i
felt
that
awful
thing
wriggling
in
my
hand
i
let
it
go
and
screamed
and
screamed
and
ma
was
cross
at
me
for
yelling
on
sunday
and
made
me
read
seven
chapters
in
the
bible
but
i
didn
t
mind
that
much
after
what
i
had
come
through
i
would
rather
die
than
have
such
an
experience
again

with
a
misfortune
while
taking
some

he

he
looked
through

and
saw
the
constable
driving
up
and
guessed
he
was
after
him
because
he
was
always
in

so
in
a
great
hurry
he
called
on
brother
casey
to

in

casey
was
praying
with
his

shut
and
everybody

had

clask
got
out

was

peg
bowen
comes
to
church
when
those
of
us
who
are
still
left
of
that
band
of
children
who
played
long
years
ago
in
the
old
orchard
and
walked
the
golden
road
together
in
joyous
companionship
foregather
now
and
again
in
our
busy
lives
and
talk
over
the
events
of
those
many
merry
moons
there
are
some
of
our
adventures
that
gleam
out
more
vividly
in
memory
than
the
others
and
are
oftener
discussed
the
time
we
bought
god
s
picture
from
jerry
cowan
the
time
dan
ate
the
poison
berries
the
time
we
heard
the
ghostly
bell
ring
the
bewitchment
of

the
visit
of
the
governor
s
wife
and
the
night
we
were
lost
in
the
storm
all
awaken
reminiscent
jest
and
laughter
but
none
more
than
the
recollection
of
the
sunday
peg
bowen
came
to
church
and
sat
in
our
pew
though
goodness
knows
as
felicity
would
say
we
did
not
think
it
any
matter
for
laughter
at
the
time
far
from
it
it
was
one
sunday
evening
in
july
uncle
alec
and
aunt
janet
having
been
out
to
the
morning
service
did
not
attend
in
the
evening
and
we
small
fry
walked
together
down
the
long
hill
road
wearing
sunday
attire
and
trying
more
or
less
successfully
to
wear
sunday
faces
also
those
walks
to
church
through
the
golden
completeness
of
the
summer
evenings
were
always
very
pleasant
to
us
and
we
never
hurried
though
on
the
other
hand
we
were
very
careful
not
to
be
late
this
particular
evening
was
particularly
beautiful
it
was
cool
after
a
hot
day
and
wheat
fields
all
about
us
were
ripening
to
their
harvestry
the
wind
gossiped
with
the
grasses
along
our
way
and
over
them
the
buttercups
danced
waves
of
sinuous
shadow
went
over
the
ripe
hayfields
and
plundering
bees
sang
a
freebooting
lilt
in
wayside
gardens
the
world
is
so
lovely
tonight
said
the
story
girl
i
just
hate
the
thought
of
going
into
the
church
and
shutting
all
the
sunlight
and
music
outside
i
wish
we
could
have
the
service
outside
in
i
don
t
think
that
would
be
very
religious
said
felicity
i
d
feel
ever
so
much
more
religious
outside
than
in
retorted
the
story
girl
if
the
service
was
outside
we
d
have
to
sit
in
the
graveyard
and
that
wouldn
t
be
very
cheerful
said
felix
besides
the
music
isn
t
shut
out
added
felicity
the
choir
is
music
has
charms
to
soothe
a
savage
breast
quoted
peter
who
was
getting
into
the
habit
of
adorning
his
conversation
with
similar
gems
that
s
in
one
of
shakespeare
s
plays
i
m
reading
them
now
since
i
got
through
with
the
bible
they
re
i
don
t
see
when
you
get
time
to
read
them
said
felicity
oh
i
read
them
sunday
afternoons
when
i
m
i
don
t
believe
they
re
fit
to
read
on
sundays
exclaimed
felicity
mother
says
valeria
montague
s
stories
ain
but
shakespeare
s
different
from
valeria
protested
peter
i
don
t
see
in
what
way
he
wrote
a
lot
of
things
that
weren
t
true
just
like
valeria
and
he
wrote
swear
words
too
valeria
never
does
that
her
characters
all
talk
in
a
very
refined
well
i
always
skip
the
swear
words
said
peter
and
marwood
said
once
that
the
bible
and
shakespeare
would
furnish
any
library
well
so
you
see
he
put
them
together
but
i
m
sure
that
he
would
never
say
that
the
bible
and
valeria
would
make
a
well
all
i
know
is
i
shall
never
read
shakespeare
on
sunday
said
felicity
loftily
i
wonder
what
kind
of
a
preacher
young
davidson
is
speculated
cecily
well
we
ll
know
when
we
hear
him
tonight
said
the
story
girl
he
ought
to
be
good
for
his
uncle
before
him
was
a
fine
preacher
though
a
very
man
but
uncle
roger
says
the
supply
in
marwood
s
vacation
never
amounts
to
much
i
know
an
awfully
funny
story
about
old
davidson
he
used
to
be
the
minister
in
baywater
you
know
and
he
had
a
large
family
and
his
children
were
very
mischievous
one
day
his
wife
was
ironing
and
she
ironed
a
great
big
nightcap
with
a
frill
round
it
one
of
the
children
took
it
when
she
wasn
t
looking
and
hid
it
in
his
father
s
best
beaver
hat
the
one
he
wore
on
sundays
when
davidson
went
to
church
next
sunday
he
put
the
hat
on
without
ever
looking
into
the
crown
he
walked
to
church
in
a
brown
study
and
at
the
door
he
took
off
his
hat
the
nightcap
just
slipped
down
on
his
head
as
if
it
had
been
put
on
and
the
frill
stood
out
around
his
face
and
the
string
hung
down
his
back
but
he
never
noticed
it
because
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
he
walked
up
the
church
aisle
and
into
the
pulpit
like
that
one
of
his
elders
had
to
tiptoe
up
and
tell
him
what
he
had
on
his
head
he
plucked
it
off
in
a
dazed
fashion
held
it
up
and
looked
at
it
bless
me
it
is
sally
s
nightcap
he
exclaimed
mildly
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
got
it
then
he
just
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
calmly
and
went
on
with
the
service
and
the
long
strings
of
the
nightcap
hung
down
out
of
his
pocket
all
the
it
seems
to
me
said
peter
amid
the
laughter
with
which
we
greeted
the
tale
that
a
funny
story
is
funnier
when
it
is
about
a
minister
than
it
is
about
any
other
man
i
wonder
sometimes
i
don
t
think
it
is
right
to
tell
funny
stories
about
ministers
said
felicity
it
certainly
isn
t
a
good
story
is
a
good
story
no
matter
who
it
s
about
said
the
story
girl
with
ungrammatical
relish
there
was
as
yet
no
one
in
the
church
when
we
reached
it
so
we
took
our
accustomed
ramble
through
the
graveyard
surrounding
it
the
story
girl
had
brought
flowers
for
her
mother
s
grave
as
usual
and
while
she
arranged
them
on
it
the
rest
of
us
read
for
the
hundredth
time
the
epitaph
on
king
s
tombstone
which
had
been
composed
by
king
that
epitaph
was
quite
famous
among
the
little
family
traditions
that
entwine
every
household
with
mingled
mirth
and
sorrow
smiles
and
tears
it
had
a
perennial
fascination
for
us
and
we
read
it
over
every
sunday
cut
deeply
in
the
upright
slab
of
red
island
sandstone
the
epitaph
ran
as
follows
sweet
departed
spirit
do
receive
the
vows
a
grateful
widow
pays
each
future
day
and
night
shall
hear
her
speak
her
isaac
s
praise
though
thy
beloved
form
must
in
the
grave
decay
yet
from
her
heart
thy
memory
no
time
no
change
shall
steal
away
do
thou
from
mansions
of
eternal
bliss
remember
thy
distressed
relict
look
on
her
with
an
angel
s
love
soothe
her
sad
life
and
cheer
her
end
through
this
world
s
dangers
and
its
griefs
then
meet
her
with
thy
smiles
and
welcome
at
the
last
great
day
well
i
can
t
make
out
what
the
old
lady
was
driving
at
said
dan
that
s
a
nice
way
to
speak
of
your
said
felicity
severely
how
does
the
family
guide
say
you
ought
to
speak
of
your
sweet
one
asked
dan
there
is
one
thing
about
it
that
puzzles
me
remarked
cecily
she
calls
herself
a
grateful
widow
now
what
was
she
grateful
for
because
she
was
rid
of
him
at
last
said
graceless
dan
oh
it
couldn
t
have
been
that
protested
cecily
seriously
i
ve
always
heard
that
and
were
very
much
attached
to
each
maybe
then
it
means
she
was
grateful
that
she
d
had
him
as
long
as
she
did
suggested
peter
she
was
grateful
to
him
because
he
had
been
so
kind
to
her
in
life
i
think
said
felicity
what
is
a
distressed
relict
asked
felix
relict
is
a
word
i
hate
said
the
story
girl
it
sounds
so
much
like
relic
relict
means
just
the
same
as
widow
only
a
man
can
be
a
relict
seemed
to
run
short
of
rhymes
at
the
last
of
the
epitaph
commented
dan
finding
rhymes
isn
t
as
easy
as
you
might
think
avowed
peter
out
of
his
own
experience
i
think
grandmother
king
intended
the
last
of
the
epitaph
to
be
in
blank
verse
said
felicity
with
dignity
there
was
still
only
a
sprinkling
of
people
in
the
church
when
we
went
in
and
took
our
places
in
the
square
king
pew
we
had
just
got
comfortably
settled
when
felicity
said
in
an
agitated
whisper
here
is
peg
bowen
we
all
stared
at
peg
who
was
pacing
composedly
up
the
aisle
we
might
be
excused
for
so
doing
for
seldom
were
the
decorous
aisles
of
carlisle
church
invaded
by
such
a
figure
peg
was
dressed
in
her
usual
short
drugget
skirt
rather
worn
and
frayed
around
the
bottom
and
a
waist
of
brilliant
turkey
red
calico
she
wore
no
hat
and
her
grizzled
black
hair
streamed
in
elf
locks
over
her
shoulders
face
arms
and
feet
were
bare
and
face
arms
and
feet
were
liberally
powdered
with
flour
certainly
no
one
who
saw
peg
that
night
could
ever
forget
the
apparition
peg
s
black
eyes
in
which
shone
a
more
than
usually
wild
and
fitful
light
roved
scrutinizingly
over
the
church
then
settled
on
our
pew
she
s
coming
here
whispered
felicity
in
horror
can
t
we
spread
out
and
make
her
think
the
pew
is
full
but
the
manoeuvre
was
too
late
the
only
result
was
that
felicity
and
the
story
girl
in
moving
over
left
a
vacant
space
between
them
and
peg
promptly
plumped
down
in
it
well
i
m
here
she
remarked
aloud
i
did
say
once
i
d
never
darken
the
door
of
carlisle
church
again
but
what
that
boy
there
nodding
at
peter
said
last
winter
set
me
thinking
and
i
concluded
maybe
i
d
better
come
once
in
a
while
to
be
on
the
safe
those
poor
girls
were
in
an
agony
everybody
in
the
church
was
looking
at
our
pew
and
smiling
we
all
felt
that
we
were
terribly
disgraced
but
we
could
do
nothing
peg
was
enjoying
herself
hugely
beyond
all
doubt
from
where
she
sat
she
could
see
the
whole
church
including
pulpit
and
gallery
and
her
black
eyes
darted
over
it
with
restless
glances
bless
me
there
s
sam
kinnaird
she
exclaimed
still
aloud
he
s
the
man
that
dunned
jacob
marr
for
four
cents
on
the
church
steps
one
sunday
i
heard
him
i
think
jacob
you
owe
me
four
cents
on
that
cow
you
bought
last
fall
rec
llect
you
couldn
t
make
the
change
well
you
know
twould
a
cat
laugh
the
kinnairds
were
all
mighty
close
i
can
tell
you
that
s
how
they
got
what
sam
kinnaird
felt
or
thought
during
this
speech
which
everyone
in
the
church
must
have
heard
i
know
not
gossip
had
it
that
he
changed
colour
we
wretched
occupants
of
the
king
pew
were
concerned
only
with
our
own
outraged
feelings
and
there
s
melita
ross
went
on
peg
she
s
got
the
same
bonnet
on
she
had
last
time
i
was
in
carlisle
church
six
years
ago
some
folks
has
the
knack
of
making
things
last
but
look
at
the
style
elmer
brewer
wears
will
yez
yez
wouldn
t
think
her
mother
died
in
the
would
yez
now
poor
mrs
brewer
from
the
tip
of
her
smart
kid
shoes
to
the
dainty
cluster
of
ostrich
tips
in
her
bonnet
she
was
most
immaculately
and
handsomely
arrayed
but
i
venture
to
think
she
could
have
taken
small
pleasure
in
her
fashionable
attire
that
evening
some
of
the
unregenerate
including
dan
were
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
but
most
of
the
people
looked
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
smile
lest
their
turn
should
come
next
there
s
old
stephen
grant
coming
in
exclaimed
peg
viciously
shaking
her
floury
fist
at
him
and
looking
as
if
butter
wouldn
t
melt
in
his
mouth
he
may
be
an
elder
but
he
s
a
scoundrel
just
the
same
he
set
fire
to
his
house
to
get
the
insurance
and
then
blamed
me
for
doing
it
but
i
got
even
with
him
for
it
oh
yes
he
knows
that
and
so
do
i
he
he
peg
chuckled
quite
fiendishly
and
stephen
grant
tried
to
look
as
if
nothing
had
been
said
oh
will
the
minister
never
come
moaned
felicity
in
my
ear
surely
she
ll
have
to
stop
but
the
minister
did
not
come
and
peg
had
no
intention
of
stopping
there
s
maria
she
resumed
i
haven
t
seen
maria
for
years
i
never
call
there
for
she
never
seems
to
have
anything
to
eat
in
the
house
she
was
a
clayton
and
the
claytons
never
could
cook
maria
sorter
looks
as
if
she
d
shrunk
in
the
wash
now
don
t
she
and
there
s
douglas
nicholson
his
brother
put
rat
poison
in
the
family
pancakes
nice
little
trick
that
wasn
t
it
they
say
it
was
by
mistake
i
hope
it
was
a
mistake
his
wife
is
all
rigged
out
in
silk
yez
wouldn
t
think
to
look
at
her
she
was
married
in
cotton
and
mighty
thankful
to
get
married
in
anything
it
s
my
opinion
there
s
timothy
patterson
he
s
the
meanest
man
alive
meaner
n
sam
kinnaird
even
timothy
pays
his
children
five
cents
apiece
to
go
without
their
suppers
and
then
steals
the
cents
out
of
their
pockets
after
they
ve
gone
to
bed
it
s
a
fact
and
when
his
old
father
died
he
wouldn
t
let
his
wife
put
his
best
shirt
on
him
he
said
his
second
best
was
plenty
good
to
be
buried
in
that
s
another
i
can
t
stand
much
more
of
this
wailed
felicity
see
here
miss
bowen
you
really
oughtn
t
to
talk
like
that
about
people
expostulated
peter
in
a
low
tone
goaded
thereto
despite
his
awe
of
peg
by
felicity
s
anguish
bless
you
boy
said
peg
the
only
difference
between
me
and
other
folks
is
that
i
say
these
things
out
loud
and
they
just
think
them
if
i
told
yez
all
the
things
i
know
about
the
people
in
this
congregation
you
d
be
amazed
have
a
peppermint
to
our
horror
peg
produced
a
handful
of
peppermint
lozenges
from
the
pocket
of
her
skirt
and
offered
us
one
each
we
did
not
dare
refuse
but
we
each
held
our
lozenge
very
gingerly
in
our
hands
eat
them
commanded
peg
rather
fiercely
mother
doesn
t
allow
us
to
eat
candy
in
church
faltered
felicity
well
i
ve
seen
just
as
fine
ladies
as
your
ma
give
their
children
lozenges
in
church
said
peg
loftily
she
put
a
peppermint
in
her
own
mouth
and
sucked
it
with
gusto
we
were
relieved
for
she
did
not
talk
during
the
process
but
our
relief
was
of
short
duration
a
bevy
of
three
very
smartly
dressed
young
ladies
sweeping
past
our
pew
started
peg
off
again
yez
needn
t
be
so
stuck
up
she
said
loudly
and
derisively
yez
was
all
of
yez
rocked
in
a
flour
barrel
and
there
s
old
henry
frewen
still
above
ground
i
called
my
parrot
after
him
because
their
noses
were
exactly
alike
look
at
caroline
marr
will
yez
that
s
a
woman
who
d
like
pretty
well
to
get
married
and
there
s
alexander
marr
he
s
a
real
christian
anyhow
and
so
s
his
dog
i
can
always
size
up
what
a
man
s
religion
amounts
to
by
the
kind
of
dog
he
keeps
alexander
marr
is
a
good
it
was
a
relief
to
hear
peg
speak
well
of
somebody
but
that
was
the
only
exception
she
made
look
at
dave
fraser
strutting
in
she
went
on
that
man
has
thanked
god
so
often
that
he
isn
t
like
other
people
that
it
s
come
to
be
true
he
isn
t
and
there
s
susan
frewen
she
s
jealous
of
everybody
she
s
even
jealous
of
old
man
rogers
because
he
s
buried
in
the
best
spot
in
the
graveyard
seth
erskine
has
the
same
look
he
was
born
with
they
say
the
lord
made
everybody
but
i
believe
the
devil
made
all
the
she
s
getting
worse
all
the
time
what
will
she
say
next
whispered
poor
felicity
but
her
martyrdom
was
over
at
last
the
minister
appeared
in
the
pulpit
and
peg
subsided
into
silence
she
folded
her
bare
floury
arms
over
her
breast
and
fastened
her
black
eyes
on
the
young
preacher
her
behaviour
for
the
next
was
decorum
itself
save
that
when
the
minister
prayed
that
we
might
all
be
charitable
in
judgment
peg
ejaculated
amen
several
times
loudly
and
forcibly
somewhat
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
young
man
to
whom
peg
was
a
stranger
he
opened
his
eyes
glanced
at
our
pew
in
a
startled
way
then
collected
himself
and
went
on
peg
listened
to
the
sermon
silently
and
motionlessly
until
davidson
was
half
through
then
she
suddenly
got
on
her
feet
this
is
too
dull
for
me
she
exclaimed
i
want
something
more
davidson
stopped
short
and
peg
marched
down
the
aisle
in
the
midst
of
complete
silence
half
way
down
the
aisle
she
turned
around
and
faced
the
minister
there
are
so
many
hypocrites
in
this
church
that
it
isn
t
fit
for
decent
people
to
come
to
she
said
rather
than
be
such
hypocrites
as
most
of
you
are
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
miles
into
the
woods
and
commit
wheeling
about
she
strode
to
the
door
then
she
turned
for
a
parthian
shot
i
ve
felt
kind
of
worried
for
god
sometimes
seeing
he
has
so
much
to
attend
to
she
said
but
i
see
i
needn
t
be
so
long
s
there
s
plenty
of
ministers
to
tell
him
what
to
with
that
peg
shook
the
dust
of
carlisle
church
from
her
feet
poor
davidson
resumed
his
discourse
old
elder
bayley
whose
attention
an
earthquake
could
not
have
distracted
from
the
sermon
afterwards
declared
that
it
was
an
excellent
and
edifying
exhortation
but
i
doubt
if
anyone
else
in
carlisle
church
tasted
it
much
or
gained
much
good
therefrom
certainly
we
of
the
king
household
did
not
we
could
not
even
remember
the
text
when
we
reached
home
felicity
was
comfortless
mr
davidson
would
be
sure
to
think
she
belonged
to
our
family
when
she
was
in
our
pew
she
said
bitterly
oh
i
feel
as
if
i
could
never
get
over
such
a
mortification
peter
i
do
wish
you
wouldn
t
go
telling
people
they
ought
to
go
to
church
it
s
all
your
fault
that
this
never
mind
it
will
be
a
good
story
to
tell
sometime
remarked
the
story
girl
with
relish
chapter
xxii
the
yankee
storm
in
an
august
orchard
six
children
and
a
were
sitting
around
the
pulpit
stone
the
was
miss
reade
who
had
been
up
to
give
the
girls
their
music
lesson
and
had
consented
to
stay
to
tea
much
to
the
rapture
of
the
said
girls
who
continued
to
worship
her
with
unabated
and
romantic
ardour
to
us
over
the
golden
grasses
came
the
story
girl
carrying
in
her
hand
a
single
large
poppy
like
a
chalice
filled
with
the
wine
of
august
wizardry
she
proffered
it
to
miss
reade
and
as
the
latter
took
it
into
her
singularly
slender
beautiful
hand
i
saw
a
ring
on
her
third
finger
i
noticed
it
because
i
had
heard
the
girls
say
that
miss
reade
never
wore
rings
not
liking
them
it
was
not
a
new
ring
it
was
handsome
but
of
an
design
and
setting
with
a
glint
of
diamonds
about
a
central
sapphire
later
on
when
miss
reade
had
gone
i
asked
the
story
girl
if
she
had
noticed
the
ring
she
nodded
but
seemed
disinclined
to
say
more
about
it
look
here
sara
i
said
there
s
something
about
that
ring
something
you
i
told
you
once
there
was
a
story
growing
but
you
would
have
to
wait
until
it
was
fully
grown
she
answered
is
miss
reade
going
to
marry
anybody
anybody
we
know
i
persisted
curiosity
killed
a
cat
observed
the
story
girl
coolly
miss
reade
hasn
t
told
me
that
she
was
going
to
marry
anybody
you
will
find
out
all
that
is
good
for
you
to
know
in
due
when
the
story
girl
put
on
airs
i
did
not
like
her
so
well
and
i
dropped
the
subject
with
a
dignity
that
seemed
to
amuse
her
mightily
she
had
been
away
for
a
week
visiting
cousins
in
markdale
and
she
had
come
home
with
a
new
of
stories
most
of
which
she
had
heard
from
the
old
sailors
of
markdale
harbour
she
had
promised
that
morning
to
tell
us
of
the
most
tragic
event
that
had
ever
been
known
on
the
north
shore
and
we
now
reminded
her
of
her
promise
some
call
it
the
yankee
storm
and
others
the
american
gale
she
began
sitting
down
by
miss
reade
and
beaming
because
the
latter
put
her
arm
around
her
waist
it
happened
nearly
forty
years
ago
in
october
of
old
coles
at
the
harbour
told
me
all
about
it
he
was
a
young
man
then
and
he
says
he
can
never
forget
that
dreadful
time
you
know
in
those
days
hundreds
of
american
fishing
schooners
used
to
come
down
to
the
gulf
every
summer
to
fish
mackerel
on
one
beautiful
saturday
night
in
this
october
of
more
than
one
hundred
of
these
vessels
could
be
counted
from
markdale
capes
by
monday
night
more
than
seventy
of
them
had
been
destroyed
those
which
had
escaped
were
mostly
those
which
went
into
harbour
saturday
night
to
keep
sunday
coles
says
the
rest
stayed
outside
and
fished
all
day
sunday
same
as
through
the
week
and
he
says
the
storm
was
a
judgment
on
them
for
doing
it
but
he
admits
that
even
some
of
them
got
into
harbour
later
on
and
escaped
so
it
s
hard
to
know
what
to
think
but
it
is
certain
that
on
sunday
night
there
came
up
a
sudden
and
terrible
storm
the
worst
coles
says
that
has
ever
been
known
on
the
north
shore
it
lasted
for
two
days
and
scores
of
vessels
were
driven
ashore
and
completely
wrecked
the
crews
of
most
of
the
vessels
that
went
ashore
on
the
sand
beaches
were
saved
but
those
that
struck
on
the
rocks
went
to
pieces
and
all
hands
were
lost
for
weeks
after
the
storm
the
north
shore
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
drowned
men
think
of
it
many
of
them
were
unknown
and
unrecognizable
and
they
were
buried
in
markdale
graveyard
coles
says
the
schoolmaster
who
was
in
markdale
then
wrote
a
poem
on
the
storm
and
coles
recited
the
first
two
verses
to
me
here
are
the
fishers
hillside
graves
the
church
beside
the
woods
around
below
the
hollow
moaning
waves
where
the
poor
fishermen
were
drowned
a
sudden
tempest
the
blue
welkin
tore
the
seamen
tossed
and
torn
apart
rolled
with
the
seaweed
to
the
shore
while
landsmen
gazed
with
aching
mr
coles
couldn
t
remember
any
more
of
it
but
the
saddest
of
all
the
stories
of
the
yankee
storm
was
the
one
about
the
franklin
dexter
the
franklin
dexter
went
ashore
on
the
markdale
capes
and
all
on
board
perished
the
captain
and
three
of
his
brothers
among
them
these
four
young
men
were
the
sons
of
an
old
man
who
lived
in
portland
maine
and
when
he
heard
what
had
happened
he
came
right
down
to
the
island
to
see
if
he
could
find
their
bodies
they
had
all
come
ashore
and
had
been
buried
in
markdale
graveyard
but
he
was
determined
to
take
them
up
and
carry
them
home
for
burial
he
said
he
had
promised
their
mother
to
take
her
boys
home
to
her
and
he
must
do
it
so
they
were
taken
up
and
put
on
board
a
sailing
vessel
at
markdale
harbour
to
be
taken
back
to
maine
while
the
father
himself
went
home
on
a
passenger
steamer
the
name
of
the
sailing
vessel
was
the
seth
hall
and
the
captain
s
name
was
seth
hall
too
captain
hall
was
a
dreadfully
profane
man
and
used
to
swear
oaths
on
the
night
he
sailed
out
of
markdale
harbour
the
old
sailors
warned
him
that
a
storm
was
brewing
and
that
it
would
catch
him
if
he
did
not
wait
until
it
was
over
the
captain
had
become
very
impatient
because
of
several
delays
he
had
already
met
with
and
he
was
in
a
furious
temper
he
swore
a
wicked
oath
that
he
would
sail
out
of
markdale
harbour
that
night
and
god
almighty
himself
shouldn
t
catch
he
did
sail
out
of
the
harbour
and
the
storm
did
catch
him
and
the
seth
hall
went
down
with
all
hands
the
dead
and
the
living
finding
a
watery
grave
together
so
the
poor
old
mother
up
in
maine
never
had
her
boys
brought
back
to
her
after
all
coles
says
it
seems
as
if
it
were
foreordained
that
they
should
not
rest
in
a
grave
but
should
lie
beneath
the
waves
until
the
day
when
the
sea
gives
up
its
they
sleep
as
well
beneath
that
purple
tide
as
others
under
turf
quoted
miss
reade
softly
i
am
very
thankful
she
added
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
whose
dear
ones
go
down
to
the
sea
in
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
treble
their
share
of
this
world
s
uncle
stephen
was
a
sailor
and
he
was
drowned
said
felicity
and
they
say
it
broke
grandmother
king
s
heart
i
don
t
see
why
people
can
t
be
contented
on

tears

been
dropping
on

was
faithfully
embroidering

had
been
diligently
collecting
names
for
it
ever
since
the
preceding
autumn
and
had
a
goodly
number
but
kitty

be
very
angry
i
wish
i
could
get
just
one
more
name
and
then
i
d
be
contented
but
i
don
t
know
of
a
single
person
who
hasn
t
been
asked
except
campbell
said
dan
oh
of
course
nobody
would
ask
campbell
we
all
know
it
would
be
of
no
use
he
doesn
t
believe
in
missions
at
all
in
fact
he
says
he
detests
the
very
mention
of
missions
and
he
never
gives
one
cent
to
all
the
same
i
think
he
ought
to
be
asked
so
that
he
wouldn
t
have
the
excuse
that
nobody
did
ask
him
declared
dan
do
you
really
think
so
dan
asked
cecily
earnestly
sure
said
dan
solemnly
dan
liked
to
tease
even
cecily
a
wee
bit
now
and
then
cecily
relapsed
into
anxious
thought
and
care
sat
visibly
on
her
brow
for
the
rest
of
the
day
next
morning
she
came
to
me
and
said
bev
would
you
like
to
go
for
a
walk
with
me
this
afternoon
of
course
i
replied
any
particular
where
i
m
going
to
see
campbell
and
ask
him
for
his
name
for
my
square
said
cecily
resolutely
i
don
t
suppose
it
will
do
any
good
he
wouldn
t
give
anything
to
the
library
last
summer
you
remember
till
the
story
girl
told
him
that
story
about
his
grandmother
she
won
t
go
with
me
this
time
i
don
t
know
why
i
can
t
tell
a
story
and
i
m
frightened
to
death
just
to
think
of
going
to
him
but
i
believe
it
is
my
duty
and
besides
i
would
love
to
get
as
many
names
on
my
square
as
kitty
marr
has
so
if
you
ll
go
with
me
we
ll
go
this
afternoon
i
simply
couldn
t
go
chapter
xxiii
a
missionary
heroine
accordingly
that
afternoon
we
bearded
the
lion
in
his
den
the
road
we
took
was
a
beautiful
one
for
we
went
cross
lots
and
we
enjoyed
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
did
not
expect
the
interview
with
campbell
to
be
a
very
pleasant
one
to
be
sure
he
had
been
quite
civil
on
the
occasion
of
our
last
call
upon
him
but
the
story
girl
had
been
with
us
then
and
had
beguiled
him
into
and
generosity
by
the
magic
of
her
voice
and
personality
we
had
no
such
ally
now
and
campbell
was
known
to
be
virulently
opposed
to
missions
in
any
shape
or
form
i
don
t
know
whether
it
would
have
been
any
better
if
i
could
have
put
on
my
good
clothes
said
cecily
with
a
rueful
glance
at
her
print
dress
which
though
neat
and
clean
was
undeniably
faded
and
rather
short
and
tight
the
story
girl
said
it
would
and
i
wanted
to
but
mother
wouldn
t
let
me
she
said
it
was
all
nonsense
and
campbell
would
never
notice
what
i
had
it
s
my
opinion
that
campbell
notices
a
good
deal
more
than
you
d
think
for
i
said
sagely
well
i
wish
our
call
was
over
sighed
cecily
i
can
t
tell
you
how
i
dread
now
see
here
sis
i
said
cheerfully
let
s
not
think
about
it
till
we
get
there
it
ll
only
spoil
our
walk
and
do
no
good
let
s
just
forget
it
and
enjoy
i
ll
try
agreed
cecily
but
it
s
ever
so
much
easier
to
preach
than
to
our
way
lay
first
over
a
hill
top
gallantly
plumed
with
golden
rod
where
cloud
shadows
drifted
over
us
like
a
gypsying
crew
carlisle
in
all
its
ripely
tinted
length
and
breadth
lay
below
us
basking
in
the
august
sunshine
that
spilled
over
the
brim
of
the
valley
to
the
markdale
harbour
cupped
in
its
hills
then
came
a
little
valley
overgrown
with
the
pale
purple
bloom
of
thistles
and
elusively
haunted
with
their
perfume
you
say
that
thistles
have
no
perfume
go
you
to
a
brook
hollow
where
they
grow
some
late
summer
twilight
at
dewfall
and
on
the
still
air
that
rises
suddenly
to
meet
you
will
come
a
waft
of
faint
aromatic
fragrance
wondrously
sweet
and
evasive
the
distillation
of
that
despised
thistle
bloom
beyond
this
the
path
wound
through
a
forest
of
fir
where
a
wood
wind
wove
its
murmurous
spell
and
a
wood
brook
dimpled
pellucidly
among
the
shadows
the
dear
companionable
elfin
shadows
that
lurked
under
the
low
growing
boughs
along
the
edges
of
that
winding
path
grew
banks
of
velvet
green
moss
starred
with
clusters
of
pigeon
berries
pigeon
berries
are
not
to
be
eaten
they
are
woolly
tasteless
things
but
they
are
to
be
looked
at
in
their
glowing
scarlet
they
are
the
jewels
with
which
the
forest
of
loves
to
deck
its
brown
breast
cecily
gathered
some
and
pinned
them
on
hers
but
they
did
not
become
her
i
thought
how
witching
the
story
girl
s
brown
curls
would
have
looked
twined
with
those
brilliant
clusters
perhaps
cecily
was
thinking
of
it
too
for
she
presently
said
bev
don
t
you
think
the
story
girl
is
changing
somehow
there
are
times
just
times
when
she
seems
to
belong
more
among
the
than
among
us
i
said
reluctantly
especially
when
she
puts
on
her
bridesmaid
well
she
s
the
oldest
of
us
and
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
she
s
fifteen
that
s
almost
sighed
cecily
then
she
added
with
sudden
vehemence
i
hate
the
thought
of
any
of
us
growing
up
felicity
says
she
just
longs
to
be
but
i
don
t
not
a
bit
i
wish
i
could
just
stay
a
little
girl
for
ever
and
have
you
and
felix
and
all
the
others
for
playmates
right
along
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
but
whenever
i
think
of
being
i
seem
to
feel
something
about
cecily
s
speech
or
the
wistful
look
that
had
crept
into
her
sweet
brown
eyes
made
me
feel
vaguely
uncomfortable
i
was
glad
that
we
were
at
the
end
of
our
journey
with
campbell
s
big
house
before
us
and
his
dog
sitting
gravely
at
the
veranda
steps
oh
dear
said
cecily
with
a
shiver
i
d
been
hoping
that
dog
wouldn
t
be
he
never
bites
i
assured
her
perhaps
he
doesn
t
but
he
always
looks
as
if
he
was
going
to
rejoined
cecily
the
dog
continued
to
look
and
as
we
edged
gingerly
past
him
and
up
the
veranda
steps
he
turned
his
head
and
kept
on
looking
what
with
campbell
before
us
and
the
dog
behind
cecily
was
trembling
with
nervousness
but
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
the
dour
brute
was
there
else
i
verily
believe
she
would
have
turned
and
fled
shamelessly
when
we
heard
steps
in
the
hall
it
was
campbell
s
housekeeper
who
came
to
the
door
however
she
ushered
us
pleasantly
into
the
where
campbell
was
reading
he
laid
down
his
book
with
a
slight
frown
and
said
nothing
at
all
in
response
to
our
timid
good
but
after
we
had
sat
for
a
few
minutes
in
wretched
silence
wishing
ourselves
a
thousand
miles
away
he
said
with
a
chuckle
well
is
it
the
school
library
again
cecily
had
remarked
as
we
were
coming
that
what
she
dreaded
most
of
all
was
introducing
the
subject
but
campbell
had
given
her
a
splendid
opening
and
she
plunged
wildly
in
at
once
rattling
her
explanation
off
nervously
with
trembling
voice
and
flushed
cheeks
no
it
s
our
mission
band
autograph
quilt
campbell
there
are
to
be
as
many
squares
in
it
as
there
are
members
in
the
band
each
one
has
a
square
and
is
collecting
names
for
it
if
you
want
to
have
your
name
on
the
quilt
you
pay
five
cents
and
if
you
want
to
have
it
right
in
the
round
spot
in
the
middle
of
the
square
you
must
pay
ten
cents
then
when
we
have
got
all
the
names
we
can
we
will
embroider
them
on
the
squares
the
money
is
to
go
to
the
little
girl
our
band
is
supporting
in
korea
i
heard
that
nobody
had
asked
you
so
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
give
me
your
name
for
my
campbell
drew
his
black
brows
together
in
a
scowl
stuff
and
nonsense
he
exclaimed
angrily
i
don
t
believe
in
foreign
missions
don
t
believe
in
them
at
all
i
never
give
a
cent
to
five
cents
isn
t
a
very
large
sum
said
cecily
earnestly
campbell
s
scowl
disappeared
and
he
laughed
it
wouldn
t
break
me
he
admitted
but
it
s
the
principle
of
the
thing
and
as
for
that
mission
band
of
yours
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
fun
you
get
out
of
it
catch
one
of
you
belonging
you
don
t
really
care
a
rap
more
for
the
heathen
than
i
oh
we
do
protested
cecily
we
do
think
of
all
the
poor
little
children
in
korea
and
we
like
to
think
we
are
helping
them
if
it
s
ever
so
little
we
are
in
earnest
campbell
indeed
we
don
t
believe
it
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
said
campbell
impolitely
you
ll
do
things
that
are
nice
and
interesting
you
ll
get
up
concerts
and
chase
people
about
for
autographs
and
give
money
your
parents
give
you
and
that
doesn
t
cost
you
either
time
or
labour
but
you
wouldn
t
do
anything
you
disliked
for
the
heathen
children
you
wouldn
t
make
any
real
sacrifice
for
them
catch
you
indeed
we
would
cried
cecily
forgetting
her
timidity
in
her
zeal
i
just
wish
i
had
a
chance
to
prove
it
to
you
do
eh
come
now
i
ll
take
you
at
your
word
i
ll
test
you
tomorrow
is
communion
sunday
and
the
church
will
be
full
of
folks
and
they
ll
all
have
their
best
clothes
on
if
you
go
to
church
tomorrow
in
the
very
costume
you
have
on
at
present
without
telling
anyone
why
you
do
so
until
it
is
all
over
i
ll
give
you
why
i
vow
i
ll
give
you
five
dollars
for
that
quilt
of
poor
cecily
to
go
to
church
in
a
faded
print
dress
with
a
shabby
little
old
and
worn
shoes
it
was
very
cruel
of
campbell
i
i
don
t
think
mother
would
let
me
she
faltered
her
tormentor
smiled
grimly
it
s
not
hard
to
find
some
excuse
he
said
sarcastically
cecily
crimsoned
and
sat
up
facing
campbell
spunkily
it
s
not
an
excuse
she
said
if
mother
will
let
me
go
to
church
like
this
i
ll
go
but
i
ll
have
to
tell
her
why
campbell
because
i
m
certain
she
d
never
let
me
if
i
didn
oh
you
can
tell
all
your
own
family
said
campbell
but
remember
none
of
them
must
tell
it
outside
until
sunday
is
over
if
they
do
i
ll
be
sure
to
find
it
out
and
then
our
bargain
is
off
if
i
see
you
in
church
tomorrow
dressed
as
you
are
now
i
ll
give
you
my
name
and
five
dollars
but
i
won
t
see
you
you
ll
shrink
when
you
ve
had
time
to
think
it
i
sha
n
t
said
cecily
resolutely
well
we
ll
see
and
now
come
out
to
the
barn
with
me
i
ve
got
the
prettiest
little
drove
of
calves
out
there
you
ever
saw
i
want
you
to
see
campbell
took
us
all
over
his
barns
and
was
very
affable
he
had
beautiful
horses
cows
and
sheep
and
i
enjoyed
seeing
them
i
don
t
think
cecily
did
however
she
was
very
quiet
and
even
campbell
s
handsome
new
span
of
dappled
grays
failed
to
arouse
any
enthusiasm
in
her
she
was
already
in
bitter
anticipation
living
over
the
martyrdom
of
the
morrow
on
the
way
home
she
asked
me
seriously
if
i
thought
campbell
would
go
to
heaven
when
he
died
of
course
he
will
i
said
isn
t
he
a
member
of
the
church
oh
yes
but
i
can
t
imagine
him
fitting
into
heaven
you
know
he
isn
t
really
fond
of
anything
but
live
he
s
fond
of
teasing
people
i
guess
i
responded
are
you
really
going
to
church
in
that
dress
sis
if
mother
ll
let
me
i
ll
have
to
said
poor
cecily
i
won
t
let
campbell
triumph
over
me
and
i
do
want
to
have
as
many
names
as
kitty
has
and
i
do
want
to
help
the
poor
little
korean
children
but
it
will
be
simply
dreadful
i
don
t
know
whether
i
hope
mother
will
or
i
did
not
believe
she
would
but
aunt
janet
sometimes
could
be
depended
on
for
the
unexpected
she
laughed
and
told
cecily
she
could
please
herself
felicity
was
in
a
rage
over
it
and
declared
she
wouldn
t
go
to
church
if
cecily
went
in
such
a
rig
dan
sarcastically
inquired
if
all
she
went
to
church
for
was
to
show
off
her
fine
clothes
and
look
at
other
people
s
then
they
quarrelled
and
didn
t
speak
to
each
other
for
two
days
much
to
cecily
s
distress
i
suspect
poor
sis
wished
devoutly
that
it
might
rain
the
next
day
but
it
was
gloriously
fine
we
were
all
waiting
in
the
orchard
for
the
story
girl
who
had
not
begun
to
dress
for
church
until
cecily
and
felicity
were
ready
felicity
was
her
prettiest
in
hat
crisp
muslin
floating
ribbons
and
trim
black
slippers
poor
cecily
stood
beside
her
mute
and
pale
in
her
faded
school
garb
and
heavy
boots
but
her
face
if
pale
was
very
determined
cecily
having
put
her
hand
to
the
plough
was
not
of
those
who
turn
back
you
do
look
just
awful
said
felicity
i
don
t
care
i
m
going
to
sit
in
uncle
james
pew
i
won
t
sit
with
you
there
will
be
so
many
strangers
there
and
all
the
markdale
people
and
what
will
they
think
of
you
some
of
them
will
never
know
the
reason
i
wish
the
story
girl
would
hurry
was
all
poor
cecily
said
we
re
going
to
be
late
it
wouldn
t
have
been
quite
so
hard
if
i
could
have
got
there
before
anyone
and
slipped
quietly
into
our
here
she
comes
at
last
said
dan
why
what
s
she
got
on
the
story
girl
joined
us
with
a
quizzical
smile
on
her
face
dan
whistled
cecily
s
pale
cheeks
flushed
with
understanding
and
gratitude
the
story
girl
wore
her
school
print
dress
and
hat
also
and
was
gloveless
and
heavy
shod
you
re
not
going
to
have
to
go
through
this
all
alone
cecily
she
said
oh
it
won
t
be
half
so
hard
now
said
cecily
with
a
long
breath
of
relief
i
fancy
it
was
hard
enough
even
then
the
story
girl
did
not
care
a
whit
but
cecily
rather
squirmed
under
the
curious
glances
that
were
cast
at
her
she
afterwards
told
me
that
she
really
did
not
think
she
could
have
endured
it
if
she
had
been
alone
campbell
met
us
under
the
elms
in
the
churchyard
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
well
you
did
it
miss
he
said
to
cecily
but
you
should
have
been
alone
that
was
what
i
meant
i
suppose
you
think
you
ve
cheated
me
no
she
doesn
t
spoke
up
the
story
girl
undauntedly
she
was
all
dressed
and
ready
to
come
before
she
knew
i
was
going
to
dress
the
same
way
so
she
kept
her
bargain
faithfully
campbell
and
i
think
you
were
cruel
to
make
her
do
you
do
eh
well
well
i
hope
you
ll
forgive
me
i
didn
t
think
she
d
do
it
i
was
sure
feminine
vanity
would
win
the
day
over
missionary
zeal
it
seems
it
didn
t
though
how
much
was
pure
missionary
zeal
and
how
much
just
plain
king
spunk
i
m
doubtful
i
ll
keep
my
promise
miss
you
shall
have
your
five
dollars
and
mind
you
put
my
name
in
the
round
space
no
corners
for
chapter
xxiv
a
tantalizing
revelation
i
shall
have
something
to
tell
you
in
the
orchard
this
evening
said
the
story
girl
at
breakfast
one
morning
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
excited
she
looked
as
if
she
had
not
slept
a
great
deal
she
had
spent
the
previous
evening
with
miss
reade
and
had
not
returned
until
the
rest
of
us
were
in
bed
miss
reade
had
finished
giving
music
lessons
and
was
going
home
in
a
few
days
cecily
and
felicity
were
in
despair
over
this
and
mourned
as
those
without
comfort
but
the
story
girl
who
had
been
even
more
devoted
to
miss
reade
than
either
of
them
had
not
as
i
noticed
expressed
any
regret
and
seemed
to
be
very
cheerful
over
the
whole
matter
why
can
t
you
tell
it
now
asked
felicity
because
the
evening
is
the
nicest
time
to
tell
things
in
i
only
mentioned
it
now
so
that
you
would
have
something
interesting
to
look
forward
to
all
is
it
about
miss
reade
asked
cecily
never
i
ll
bet
she
s
going
to
be
married
i
exclaimed
remembering
the
ring
is
she
cried
felicity
and
cecily
together
the
story
girl
threw
an
annoyed
glance
at
me
she
did
not
like
to
have
her
dramatic
announcements
forestalled
i
don
t
say
that
it
is
about
miss
reade
or
that
it
isn
t
you
must
just
wait
till
the
i
wonder
what
it
is
speculated
cecily
as
the
story
girl
left
the
room
i
don
t
believe
it
s
much
of
anything
said
felicity
beginning
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
dishes
the
story
girl
always
likes
to
make
so
much
out
of
so
little
anyhow
i
don
t
believe
miss
reade
is
going
to
be
married
she
hasn
t
any
beaus
around
here
and
armstrong
says
she
s
sure
she
doesn
t
correspond
with
anybody
besides
if
she
was
she
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
tell
the
story
oh
she
might
they
re
such
friends
you
know
said
cecily
miss
reade
is
no
better
friends
with
her
than
she
is
with
me
and
you
retorted
felicity
no
but
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
she
s
a
different
kind
of
friend
with
the
story
girl
than
she
is
with
me
and
you
reflected
cecily
i
can
t
just
explain
what
i
no
wonder
such
nonsense
sniffed
felicity
it
s
only
some
girl
s
secret
anyway
said
dan
loftily
i
don
t
feel
much
interest
in
but
he
was
on
hand
with
the
rest
of
us
that
evening
interest
or
no
interest
in
uncle
stephen
s
walk
where
the
ripening
apples
were
beginning
to
glow
like
jewels
among
the
boughs
now
are
you
going
to
tell
us
your
news
asked
felicity
impatiently
miss
reade
is
going
to
be
married
said
the
story
girl
she
told
me
so
last
night
she
is
going
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
s
who
to
exclaimed
the
girls
to
the
story
girl
threw
a
defiant
glance
at
me
as
if
to
say
you
can
t
spoil
the
surprise
of
this
anyway
to
the
awkward
for
a
few
moments
amazement
literally
held
us
dumb
you
re
not
in
earnest
sara
stanley
gasped
felicity
at
last
indeed
i
am
i
thought
you
d
be
astonished
but
i
wasn
t
i
ve
suspected
it
all
summer
from
little
things
i
ve
noticed
don
t
you
remember
that
evening
last
spring
when
i
went
a
piece
with
miss
reade
and
told
you
when
i
came
back
that
a
story
was
growing
i
guessed
it
from
the
way
the
awkward
man
looked
at
her
when
i
stopped
to
speak
to
him
over
his
garden
but
the
awkward
man
said
felicity
helplessly
it
doesn
t
seem
possible
did
miss
reade
tell
you
herself
i
suppose
it
must
be
true
then
but
how
did
it
ever
come
about
he
s
so
shy
and
awkward
how
did
he
ever
manage
to
get
up
enough
spunk
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
maybe
she
asked
him
suggested
dan
the
story
girl
looked
as
if
she
might
tell
if
she
would
i
believe
that
was
the
way
of
it
i
said
to
draw
her
on
not
exactly
she
said
reluctantly
i
know
all
about
it
but
i
can
t
tell
you
i
guessed
part
from
things
i
ve
seen
and
miss
reade
told
me
a
good
deal
and
the
awkward
man
himself
told
me
his
side
of
it
as
we
came
home
last
night
i
met
him
just
as
i
left
armstrong
s
and
we
were
together
as
far
as
his
house
it
was
dark
and
he
just
talked
on
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
i
think
he
forgot
i
was
there
at
all
once
he
got
started
he
has
never
been
shy
or
awkward
with
me
but
he
never
talked
as
he
did
last
you
might
tell
us
what
he
said
urged
cecily
we
d
never
the
story
girl
shook
her
head
no
i
can
t
you
wouldn
t
understand
besides
i
couldn
t
tell
it
just
right
it
s
one
of
the
things
that
are
hardest
to
tell
i
d
spoil
it
if
i
told
it
now
perhaps
some
day
i
ll
be
able
to
tell
it
properly
it
s
very
beautiful
but
it
might
sound
very
ridiculous
if
it
wasn
t
told
just
exactly
the
right
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
and
i
don
t
believe
you
know
yourself
said
felicity
pettishly
all
that
i
can
make
out
is
that
miss
reade
is
going
to
marry
jasper
dale
and
i
don
t
like
the
idea
one
bit
she
is
so
beautiful
and
sweet
i
thought
she
d
marry
some
dashing
young
man
jasper
dale
must
be
nearly
twenty
years
older
than
her
and
he
s
so
queer
and
shy
and
such
a
miss
reade
is
perfectly
happy
said
the
story
girl
she
thinks
the
awkward
man
is
lovely
and
so
he
is
you
don
t
know
him
but
i
well
you
needn
t
put
on
such
airs
about
it
sniffed
felicity
i
am
not
putting
on
any
airs
but
it
s
true
miss
reade
and
i
are
the
only
people
in
carlisle
who
really
know
the
awkward
man
nobody
else
ever
got
behind
his
shyness
to
find
out
just
what
sort
of
a
man
he
when
are
they
to
be
married
asked
felicity
in
a
fortnight
s
time
and
then
they
are
coming
right
back
to
live
at
golden
milestone
won
t
it
be
lovely
to
have
miss
reade
always
so
near
us
i
wonder
what
she
ll
think
about
the
mystery
of
golden
milestone
remarked
felicity
golden
milestone
was
the
beautiful
name
the
awkward
man
had
given
his
home
and
there
was
a
mystery
about
it
as
readers
of
the
first
volume
of
these
chronicles
will
recall
she
knows
all
about
the
mystery
and
thinks
it
perfectly
lovely
and
so
do
i
said
the
story
girl
do
you
know
the
secret
of
the
locked
room
cried
cecily
yes
the
awkward
man
told
me
all
about
it
last
night
i
told
you
i
d
find
out
the
mystery
some
and
what
is
it
i
can
t
tell
you
that
i
think
you
re
hateful
and
mean
exclaimed
felicity
it
hasn
t
anything
to
do
with
miss
reade
so
i
think
you
might
tell
it
has
something
to
do
with
miss
reade
it
s
all
about
well
i
don
t
see
how
that
can
be
when
the
awkward
man
never
saw
or
heard
of
miss
reade
until
she
came
to
carlisle
in
the
spring
said
felicity
incredulously
and
he
s
had
that
locked
room
for
i
can
t
explain
it
to
you
but
it
s
just
as
i
ve
said
responded
the
story
girl
well
it
s
a
very
queer
thing
retorted
felicity
the
name
in
the
books
in
the
room
was
alice
and
miss
reade
s
name
is
alice
marvelled
cecily
did
he
know
her
before
she
came
here
mrs
griggs
says
that
room
has
been
locked
for
ten
years
ten
years
ago
miss
reade
was
just
a
little
girl
of
ten
she
couldn
t
be
the
alice
of
the
books
argued
felicity
i
wonder
if
she
ll
wear
the
blue
silk
dress
said
sara
ray
and
what
will
she
do
about
the
picture
if
it
isn
t
hers
added
cecily
the
picture
couldn
t
be
hers
or
griggs
would
have
known
her
for
the
same
when
she
came
to
carlisle
said
felix
i
m
going
to
stop
wondering
about
it
exclaimed
felicity
crossly
aggravated
by
the
amused
smile
with
which
the
story
girl
was
listening
to
the
various
speculations
i
think
sara
is
just
as
mean
as
mean
when
she
won
t
tell
i
can
t
repeated
the
story
girl
patiently
you
said
one
time
you
had
an
idea
who
alice
was
i
said
was
your
idea
anything
like
the
truth
yes
i
guessed
pretty
nearly
do
you
suppose
they
ll
keep
the
room
locked
after
they
are
married
asked
cecily
oh
no
i
can
tell
you
that
much
it
is
to
be
miss
reade
s
own
particular
sitting
why
then
perhaps
we
ll
see
it
some
time
ourselves
when
we
go
to
see
miss
reade
cried
cecily
i
d
be
frightened
to
go
into
it
confessed
sara
ray
i
hate
things
with
mysteries
they
always
make
me
i
love
them
they
re
so
exciting
said
the
story
girl
just
think
this
will
be
the
second
wedding
of
people
we
know
reflected
cecily
isn
t
that
interesting
i
only
hope
the
next
thing
won
t
be
a
funeral
remarked
sara
ray
gloomily
there
were
three
lighted
lamps
on
our
kitchen
table
last
night
and
judy
pineau
says
that
s
a
sure
sign
of
a
well
there
are
funerals
going
on
all
the
time
said
dan
but
it
means
the
funeral
of
somebody
you
know
i
don
t
believe
in
it
much
but
judy
says
she
s
seen
it
come
true
time
and
again
i
hope
if
it
does
it
won
t
be
anybody
we
know
very
well
but
i
hope
it
ll
be
somebody
i
know
a
little
because
then
i
might
get
to
the
funeral
i
d
just
love
to
go
to
a
that
s
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
commented
felicity
in
a
shocked
tone
sara
ray
looked
bewildered
i
don
t
see
what
is
dreadful
in
it
she
protested
people
don
t
go
to
funerals
for
the
fun
of
it
said
felicity
severely
and
you
just
as
good
as
said
you
hoped
somebody
you
knew
would
die
so
you
d
get
to
the
no
no
i
didn
t
i
didn
t
mean
that
at
all
felicity
i
don
t
want
anybody
to
die
but
what
i
meant
was
if
anybody
i
knew
had
to
die
there
might
be
a
chance
to
go
to
the
funeral
i
ve
never
been
to
a
single
funeral
yet
and
it
must
be
so
well
don
t
mix
up
talk
about
funerals
with
talk
about
weddings
said
felicity
it
isn
t
lucky
i
think
miss
reade
is
simply
throwing
herself
away
but
i
hope
she
ll
be
happy
and
i
hope
the
awkward
man
will
manage
to
get
married
without
making
some
awful
blunder
but
it
s
more
than
i
the
ceremony
is
to
be
very
private
said
the
story
girl
i
d
like
to
see
them
the
day
they
appear
out
in
church
chuckled
dan
how
ll
he
ever
manage
to
bring
her
in
and
show
her
into
the
pew
i
ll
bet
he
ll
go
in
first
or
tramp
on
her
dress
or
fall
over
his
maybe
he
won
t
go
to
church
at
all
the
first
sunday
and
she
ll
have
to
go
alone
said
peter
that
happened
in
markdale
a
man
was
too
bashful
to
go
to
church
the
first
time
after
getting
married
and
his
wife
went
alone
till
he
got
used
to
the
they
may
do
things
like
that
in
markdale
but
that
is
not
the
way
people
behave
in
carlisle
said
felicity
loftily
seeing
the
story
girl
slipping
away
with
a
disapproving
face
i
joined
her
what
is
the
matter
sara
i
asked
i
hate
to
hear
them
talking
like
that
about
miss
reade
and
dale
she
answered
vehemently
it
s
really
all
so
beautiful
but
they
make
it
seem
silly
and
absurd
you
might
tell
me
all
about
it
sara
i
insinuated
i
wouldn
t
tell
and
i
d
yes
i
think
you
would
she
said
thoughtfully
but
i
can
t
tell
it
even
to
you
because
i
can
t
tell
it
well
enough
yet
i
ve
a
feeling
that
there
s
only
one
way
to
tell
it
and
i
don
t
know
the
way
yet
some
day
i
ll
know
it
and
then
i
ll
tell
you
long
long
after
she
kept
her
word
forty
years
later
i
wrote
to
her
across
the
leagues
of
land
and
sea
that
divided
us
and
told
her
that
jasper
dale
was
dead
and
i
reminded
her
of
her
old
promise
and
asked
its
fulfilment
in
reply
she
sent
me
the
written
love
story
of
jasper
dale
and
alice
reade
now
when
alice
sleeps
under
the
whispering
elms
of
the
old
carlisle
churchyard
beside
the
husband
of
her
youth
that
story
may
be
given
in
all
its
sweetness
to
the
world
chapter
xxv
the
love
story
of
the
awkward
man
written
by
the
story
girl
jasper
dale
lived
alone
in
the
old
homestead
which
he
had
named
golden
milestone
in
carlisle
this
giving
one
s
farm
a
name
was
looked
upon
as
a
piece
of
affectation
but
if
a
place
must
be
named
why
not
give
it
a
sensible
name
with
some
meaning
to
it
why
golden
milestone
when
pinewood
or
hillslope
or
if
you
wanted
to
be
very
fanciful
ivy
lodge
might
be
had
for
the
taking
he
had
lived
alone
at
golden
milestone
since
his
mother
s
death
he
had
been
twenty
then
and
he
was
close
upon
forty
now
though
he
did
not
look
it
but
neither
could
it
be
said
that
he
looked
young
he
had
never
at
any
time
looked
young
with
common
youth
there
had
always
been
something
in
his
appearance
that
stamped
him
as
different
from
the
ordinary
run
of
men
and
apart
from
his
shyness
built
up
an
intangible
invisible
barrier
between
him
and
his
kind
he
had
lived
all
his
life
in
carlisle
and
all
the
carlisle
people
knew
of
or
about
him
although
they
thought
they
knew
everything
was
that
he
was
painfully
abnormally
shy
he
never
went
anywhere
except
to
church
he
never
took
part
in
carlisle
s
simple
social
life
even
with
most
men
he
was
distant
and
reserved
as
for
women
he
never
spoke
to
or
looked
at
them
if
one
spoke
to
him
even
if
she
were
a
matronly
old
mother
in
israel
he
was
at
once
in
an
agony
of
painful
blushes
he
had
no
friends
in
the
sense
of
companions
to
all
outward
appearance
his
life
was
solitary
and
devoid
of
any
human
interest
he
had
no
housekeeper
but
his
old
house
furnished
as
it
had
been
in
his
mother
s
lifetime
was
cleanly
and
daintily
kept
the
quaint
rooms
were
as
free
from
dust
and
disorder
as
a
woman
could
have
had
them
this
was
known
because
jasper
dale
occasionally
had
his
hired
man
s
wife
griggs
in
to
scrub
for
him
on
the
morning
she
was
expected
he
betook
himself
to
woods
and
fields
returning
only
at
during
his
absence
griggs
was
frankly
wont
to
explore
the
house
from
cellar
to
attic
and
her
report
of
its
condition
was
always
the
same
neat
as
to
be
sure
there
was
one
room
that
was
always
locked
against
her
the
west
gable
looking
out
on
the
garden
and
the
hill
of
pines
beyond
but
griggs
knew
that
in
the
lifetime
of
jasper
dale
s
mother
it
had
been
unfurnished
she
supposed
it
still
remained
so
and
felt
no
especial
curiosity
concerning
it
though
she
always
tried
the
door
jasper
dale
had
a
good
farm
well
cultivated
he
had
a
large
garden
where
he
worked
most
of
his
spare
time
in
summer
it
was
supposed
that
he
read
a
great
deal
since
the
postmistress
declared
that
he
was
always
getting
books
and
magazines
by
mail
he
seemed
well
contented
with
his
existence
and
people
let
him
alone
since
that
was
the
greatest
kindness
they
could
do
him
it
was
unsupposable
that
he
would
ever
marry
nobody
ever
had
supposed
it
jasper
dale
never
so
much
as
thought
about
a
woman
carlisle
oracles
declared
oracles
however
are
not
always
to
be
trusted
one
day
griggs
went
away
from
the
dale
place
with
a
very
curious
story
which
she
diligently
spread
far
and
wide
it
made
a
good
deal
of
talk
but
people
although
they
listened
eagerly
and
wondered
and
questioned
were
rather
incredulous
about
it
they
thought
griggs
must
be
drawing
considerably
upon
her
imagination
there
were
not
lacking
those
who
declared
that
she
had
invented
the
whole
account
since
her
reputation
for
strict
veracity
was
not
wholly
unquestioned
griggs
s
story
was
as
follows
one
day
she
found
the
door
of
the
west
gable
unlocked
she
went
in
expecting
to
see
bare
walls
and
a
collection
of
odds
and
ends
instead
she
found
herself
in
a
finely
furnished
room
delicate
lace
curtains
hung
before
the
small
square
windows
the
walls
were
adorned
with
pictures
in
much
finer
taste
than
griggs
could
appreciate
there
was
a
bookcase
between
the
windows
filled
with
choicely
bound
books
beside
it
stood
a
little
table
with
a
very
dainty
on
it
by
the
basket
griggs
saw
a
pair
of
tiny
scissors
and
a
silver
thimble
a
wicker
rocker
comfortable
with
silk
cushions
was
near
it
above
the
bookcase
a
woman
s
picture
hung
a
if
griggs
had
but
known
it
representing
a
pale
very
sweet
face
with
large
dark
eyes
and
a
wistful
expression
under
loose
masses
of
black
lustrous
hair
just
beneath
the
picture
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
bookcase
was
a
vaseful
of
flowers
another
vaseful
stood
on
the
table
beside
the
basket
all
this
was
astonishing
enough
but
what
puzzled
griggs
completely
was
the
fact
that
a
woman
s
dress
was
hanging
over
a
chair
before
the
mirror
a
pale
blue
silken
affair
and
on
the
floor
beside
it
were
two
little
blue
satin
slippers
good
griggs
did
not
leave
the
room
until
she
had
thoroughly
explored
it
even
to
shaking
out
the
blue
dress
and
discovering
it
to
be
a
wrapper
she
called
it
but
she
found
nothing
to
throw
any
light
on
the
mystery
the
fact
that
the
simple
name
alice
was
written
on
the
of
all
the
books
only
deepened
it
for
it
was
a
name
unknown
in
the
dale
family
in
this
puzzled
state
she
was
obliged
to
depart
nor
did
she
ever
find
the
door
unlocked
again
and
discovering
that
people
thought
she
was
romancing
when
she
talked
about
the
mysterious
west
gable
at
golden
milestone
she
indignantly
held
her
peace
concerning
the
whole
affair
but
griggs
had
told
no
more
than
the
simple
truth
jasper
dale
under
all
his
shyness
and
aloofness
possessed
a
nature
full
of
delicate
romance
and
poesy
which
denied
expression
in
the
common
ways
of
life
bloomed
out
in
the
realm
of
fancy
and
imagination
left
alone
just
when
the
boy
s
nature
was
deepening
into
the
man
s
he
turned
to
this
ideal
kingdom
for
all
he
believed
the
real
world
could
never
give
him
love
a
strange
almost
mystical
love
played
its
part
here
for
him
he
shadowed
forth
to
himself
the
vision
of
a
woman
loving
and
beloved
he
cherished
it
until
it
became
almost
as
real
to
him
as
his
own
personality
and
he
gave
this
dream
woman
the
name
he
liked
best
alice
in
fancy
he
walked
and
talked
with
her
spoke
words
of
love
to
her
and
heard
words
of
love
in
return
when
he
came
from
work
at
the
close
of
day
she
met
him
at
his
threshold
in
the
twilight
a
strange
fair
starry
shape
as
elusive
and
spiritual
as
a
blossom
reflected
in
a
pool
by
moonlight
with
welcome
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
one
day
when
he
was
in
charlottetown
on
business
he
had
been
struck
by
a
picture
in
the
window
of
a
store
it
was
strangely
like
the
woman
of
his
dream
love
he
went
in
awkward
and
embarrassed
and
bought
it
when
he
took
it
home
he
did
not
know
where
to
put
it
it
was
out
of
place
among
the
dim
old
engravings
of
bewigged
portraits
and
conventional
landscapes
on
the
walls
of
golden
milestone
as
he
pondered
the
matter
in
his
garden
that
evening
he
had
an
inspiration
the
sunset
flaming
on
the
windows
of
the
west
gable
kindled
them
into
burning
rose
amid
the
splendour
he
fancied
alice
s
fair
face
peeping
archly
down
at
him
from
the
room
the
inspiration
came
then
it
should
be
her
room
he
would
fit
it
up
for
her
and
her
picture
should
hang
there
he
was
all
summer
carrying
out
his
plan
nobody
must
know
or
suspect
so
he
must
go
slowly
and
secretly
one
by
one
the
furnishings
were
purchased
and
brought
home
under
cover
of
darkness
he
arranged
them
with
his
own
hands
he
bought
the
books
he
thought
she
would
like
best
and
wrote
her
name
in
them
he
got
the
little
feminine
of
basket
and
thimble
finally
he
saw
in
a
store
a
pale
blue
and
the
satin
slippers
he
had
always
fancied
her
as
dressed
in
blue
he
bought
them
and
took
them
home
to
her
room
thereafter
it
was
sacred
to
her
he
always
knocked
on
its
door
before
he
entered
he
kept
it
sweet
with
fresh
flowers
he
sat
there
in
the
purple
summer
evenings
and
talked
aloud
to
her
or
read
his
favourite
books
to
her
in
his
fancy
she
sat
opposite
to
him
in
her
rocker
clad
in
the
trailing
blue
gown
with
her
head
leaning
on
one
slender
hand
as
white
as
a
twilight
star
but
carlisle
people
knew
nothing
of
this
would
have
thought
him
tinged
with
mild
lunacy
if
they
had
known
to
them
he
was
just
the
shy
simple
farmer
he
appeared
they
never
knew
or
guessed
at
the
real
jasper
dale
one
spring
alice
reade
came
to
teach
music
in
carlisle
her
pupils
worshipped
her
but
the
grown
people
thought
she
was
rather
too
distant
and
reserved
they
had
been
used
to
merry
jolly
girls
who
joined
eagerly
in
the
social
life
of
the
place
alice
reade
held
herself
aloof
from
it
not
disdainfully
but
as
one
to
whom
these
things
were
of
small
importance
she
was
very
fond
of
books
and
solitary
rambles
she
was
not
at
all
shy
but
she
was
as
sensitive
as
a
flower
and
after
a
time
carlisle
people
were
content
to
let
her
live
her
own
life
and
no
longer
resented
her
unlikeness
to
themselves
she
boarded
with
the
armstrongs
who
lived
beyond
golden
milestone
around
the
hill
of
pines
until
the
snow
disappeared
she
went
out
to
the
main
road
by
the
long
armstrong
lane
but
when
spring
came
she
was
wont
to
take
a
shorter
way
down
the
pine
hill
across
the
brook
past
jasper
dale
s
garden
and
out
through
his
lane
and
one
day
as
she
went
by
jasper
dale
was
working
in
his
garden
he
was
on
his
knees
in
a
corner
setting
out
a
bunch
of
roots
an
unsightly
little
tangle
of
rainbow
possibilities
it
was
a
still
spring
morning
the
world
was
green
with
young
leaves
a
little
wind
blew
down
from
the
pines
and
lost
itself
willingly
among
the
budding
delights
of
the
garden
the
grass
opened
eyes
of
blue
violets
the
sky
was
high
and
cloudless
shading
off
into
milkiness
on
the
far
horizons
birds
were
singing
along
the
brook
valley
rollicking
robins
were
whistling
joyously
in
the
pines
jasper
dale
s
heart
was
filled
to
with
a
realization
of
all
the
virgin
loveliness
around
him
the
feeling
in
his
soul
had
the
sacredness
of
a
prayer
at
this
moment
he
looked
up
and
saw
alice
reade
she
was
standing
outside
the
garden
fence
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
pine
tree
looking
not
at
him
for
she
was
unaware
of
his
presence
but
at
the
virginal
bloom
of
the
plum
trees
in
a
far
corner
with
all
her
delight
in
it
outblossoming
freely
in
her
face
for
a
moment
jasper
dale
believed
that
his
dream
love
had
taken
visible
form
before
him
she
was
like
so
like
not
in
feature
perhaps
but
in
grace
and
colouring
the
grace
of
a
slender
lissome
form
and
the
colouring
of
cloudy
hair
and
wistful
dark
gray
eyes
and
curving
red
mouth
and
more
than
all
she
was
like
her
in
expression
in
the
subtle
revelation
of
personality
exhaling
from
her
like
perfume
from
a
flower
it
was
as
if
his
own
had
come
to
him
at
last
and
his
whole
soul
suddenly
leaped
out
to
meet
and
welcome
her
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
and
the
spell
was
broken
jasper
remained
kneeling
mutely
there
shy
man
once
more
crimson
with
blushes
a
strange
almost
pitiful
creature
in
his
abject
confusion
a
little
smile
flickered
about
the
delicate
corners
of
her
mouth
but
she
turned
and
walked
swiftly
away
down
the
lane
jasper
looked
after
her
with
a
new
painful
sense
of
loss
and
loveliness
it
had
been
agony
to
feel
her
conscious
eyes
upon
him
but
he
realized
now
that
there
had
been
a
strange
sweetness
in
it
too
it
was
still
greater
pain
to
watch
her
going
from
him
he
thought
she
must
be
the
new
music
teacher
but
he
did
not
even
know
her
name
she
had
been
dressed
in
blue
too
a
pale
dainty
blue
but
that
was
of
course
he
had
known
she
must
wear
it
and
he
was
sure
her
name
must
be
alice
when
later
on
he
discovered
that
it
was
he
felt
no
surprise
he
carried
some
mayflowers
up
to
the
west
gable
and
put
them
under
the
picture
but
the
charm
had
gone
out
of
the
tribute
and
looking
at
the
picture
he
thought
how
scant
was
the
justice
it
did
her
her
face
was
so
much
sweeter
her
eyes
so
much
softer
her
hair
so
much
more
lustrous
the
soul
of
his
love
had
gone
from
the
room
and
from
the
picture
and
from
his
dreams
when
he
tried
to
think
of
the
alice
he
loved
he
saw
not
the
shadowy
spirit
occupant
of
the
west
gable
but
the
young
girl
who
had
stood
under
the
pine
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
moonlight
of
starshine
on
still
water
of
white
flowers
growing
in
silent
shadowy
places
he
did
not
then
realize
what
this
meant
had
he
realized
it
he
would
have
suffered
bitterly
as
it
was
he
felt
only
a
vague
discomfort
a
curious
sense
of
loss
and
gain
commingled
he
saw
her
again
that
afternoon
on
her
way
home
she
did
not
pause
by
the
garden
but
walked
swiftly
past
thereafter
every
day
for
a
week
he
watched
unseen
to
see
her
pass
his
home
once
a
little
child
was
with
her
clinging
to
her
hand
no
child
had
ever
before
had
any
part
in
the
shy
man
s
dream
life
but
that
night
in
the
twilight
the
vision
of
the
was
a
girl
in
a
blue
print
dress
with
a
little
shape
at
her
knee
a
shape
that
lisped
and
prattled
and
called
her
mother
and
both
of
them
were
his
it
was
the
next
day
that
he
failed
for
the
first
time
to
put
flowers
in
the
west
gable
instead
he
cut
a
loose
handful
of
daffodils
and
looking
furtively
about
him
as
if
committing
a
crime
he
laid
them
across
the
footpath
under
the
pine
she
must
pass
that
way
her
feet
would
crush
them
if
she
failed
to
see
them
then
he
slipped
back
into
his
garden
half
exultant
half
repentant
from
a
safe
retreat
he
saw
her
pass
by
and
stoop
to
lift
his
flowers
thereafter
he
put
some
in
the
same
place
every
day
when
alice
reade
saw
the
flowers
she
knew
at
once
who
had
put
them
there
and
divined
that
they
were
for
her
she
lifted
them
tenderly
in
much
surprise
and
pleasure
she
had
heard
all
about
jasper
dale
and
his
shyness
but
before
she
had
heard
about
him
she
had
seen
him
in
church
and
liked
him
she
thought
his
face
and
his
dark
blue
eyes
beautiful
she
even
liked
the
long
brown
hair
that
carlisle
people
laughed
at
that
he
was
quite
different
from
other
people
she
had
understood
at
once
but
she
thought
the
difference
in
his
favour
perhaps
her
sensitive
nature
divined
and
responded
to
the
beauty
in
his
at
least
in
her
eyes
jasper
dale
was
never
a
ridiculous
figure
when
she
heard
the
story
of
the
west
gable
which
most
people
disbelieved
she
believed
it
although
she
did
not
understand
it
it
invested
the
shy
man
with
interest
and
romance
she
felt
that
she
would
have
liked
out
of
no
impertinent
curiosity
to
solve
the
mystery
she
believed
that
it
contained
the
key
to
his
character
thereafter
every
day
she
found
flowers
under
the
pine
tree
she
wished
to
see
jasper
to
thank
him
unaware
that
he
watched
her
daily
from
the
screen
of
shrubbery
in
his
garden
but
it
was
some
time
before
she
found
the
opportunity
one
evening
she
passed
when
he
not
expecting
her
was
leaning
against
his
garden
fence
with
a
book
in
his
hand
she
stopped
under
the
pine
mr
dale
she
said
softly
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
jasper
startled
wished
that
he
might
sink
into
the
ground
his
anguish
of
embarrassment
made
her
smile
a
little
he
could
not
speak
so
she
went
on
gently
it
has
been
so
good
of
you
they
have
given
me
so
much
pleasure
i
wish
you
could
know
how
it
was
nothing
nothing
stammered
jasper
his
book
had
fallen
on
the
ground
at
her
feet
and
she
picked
it
up
and
held
it
out
to
him
so
you
like
ruskin
she
said
i
do
too
but
i
haven
t
read
if
you
would
care
to
read
it
you
may
have
it
jasper
contrived
to
say
she
carried
the
book
away
with
her
he
did
not
again
hide
when
she
passed
and
when
she
brought
the
book
back
they
talked
a
little
about
it
over
the
fence
he
lent
her
others
and
got
some
from
her
in
return
they
fell
into
the
habit
of
discussing
them
jasper
did
not
find
it
hard
to
talk
to
her
now
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
talking
to
his
dream
alice
and
it
came
strangely
natural
to
him
he
did
not
talk
volubly
but
alice
thought
what
he
did
say
was
worth
while
his
words
lingered
in
her
memory
and
made
music
she
always
found
his
flowers
under
the
pine
and
she
always
wore
some
of
them
but
she
did
not
know
if
he
noticed
this
or
not
one
evening
jasper
walked
shyly
with
her
from
his
gate
up
the
pine
hill
after
that
he
always
walked
that
far
with
her
she
would
have
missed
him
much
if
he
had
failed
to
do
so
yet
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
she
was
learning
to
love
him
she
would
have
laughed
with
girlish
scorn
at
the
idea
she
liked
him
very
much
she
thought
his
nature
beautiful
in
its
simplicity
and
purity
in
spite
of
his
shyness
she
felt
more
delightfully
at
home
in
his
society
than
in
that
of
any
other
person
she
had
ever
met
he
was
one
of
those
rare
souls
whose
friendship
is
at
once
a
pleasure
and
a
benediction
showering
light
from
their
own
crystal
clearness
into
all
the
dark
corners
in
the
souls
of
others
until
for
the
time
being
at
least
they
reflected
his
own
nobility
but
she
never
thought
of
love
like
other
girls
she
had
her
dreams
of
a
possible
prince
charming
young
and
handsome
and
debonair
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
be
found
in
the
shy
dreamy
recluse
of
golden
milestone
in
august
came
a
day
of
gold
and
blue
alice
reade
coming
through
the
trees
with
the
wind
blowing
her
little
dark
tricksily
about
under
her
wide
blue
hat
found
a
fragrant
heap
of
mignonette
under
the
pine
she
lifted
it
and
buried
her
face
in
it
drinking
in
the
wholesome
modest
perfume
she
had
hoped
jasper
would
be
in
his
garden
since
she
wished
to
ask
him
for
a
book
she
greatly
desired
to
read
but
she
saw
him
sitting
on
the
rustic
seat
at
the
further
side
his
back
was
towards
her
and
he
was
partially
screened
by
a
copse
of
lilacs
alice
blushing
slightly
unlatched
the
garden
gate
and
went
down
the
path
she
had
never
been
in
the
garden
before
and
she
found
her
heart
beating
in
a
strange
fashion
he
did
not
hear
her
footsteps
and
she
was
close
behind
him
when
she
heard
his
voice
and
realized
that
he
was
talking
to
himself
in
a
low
dreamy
tone
as
the
meaning
of
his
words
dawned
on
her
consciousness
she
started
and
grew
crimson
she
could
not
move
or
speak
as
one
in
a
dream
she
stood
and
listened
to
the
shy
man
s
reverie
guiltless
of
any
thought
of
eavesdropping
how
much
i
love
you
alice
jasper
dale
was
saying
unafraid
with
no
shyness
in
voice
or
manner
i
wonder
what
you
would
say
if
you
knew
you
would
laugh
at
me
sweet
as
you
are
you
would
laugh
in
mockery
i
can
never
tell
you
i
can
only
dream
of
telling
you
in
my
dream
you
are
standing
here
by
me
dear
i
can
see
you
very
plainly
my
sweet
lady
so
tall
and
gracious
with
your
dark
hair
and
your
maiden
eyes
i
can
dream
that
i
tell
you
my
love
that
maddest
sweetest
dream
of
all
that
you
love
me
in
return
everything
is
possible
in
dreams
you
know
dear
my
dreams
are
all
i
have
so
i
go
far
in
them
even
to
dreaming
that
you
are
my
wife
i
dream
how
i
shall
fix
up
my
dull
old
house
for
you
one
room
will
need
nothing
more
it
is
your
room
dear
and
has
been
ready
for
you
a
long
time
long
before
that
day
i
saw
you
under
the
pine
your
books
and
your
chair
and
your
picture
are
there
dear
only
the
picture
is
not
half
lovely
enough
but
the
other
rooms
of
the
house
must
be
made
to
bloom
out
freshly
for
you
what
a
delight
it
is
thus
to
dream
of
what
i
would
do
for
you
then
i
would
bring
you
home
dear
and
lead
you
through
my
garden
and
into
my
house
as
its
mistress
i
would
see
you
standing
beside
me
in
the
old
mirror
at
the
end
of
the
hall
a
bride
in
your
pale
blue
dress
with
a
blush
on
your
face
i
would
lead
you
through
all
the
rooms
made
ready
for
your
coming
and
then
to
your
own
i
would
see
you
sitting
in
your
own
chair
and
all
my
dreams
would
find
rich
fulfilment
in
that
royal
moment
oh
alice
we
would
have
a
beautiful
life
together
it
s
sweet
to
make
believe
about
it
you
will
sing
to
me
in
the
twilight
and
we
will
gather
early
flowers
together
in
the
spring
days
when
i
come
home
from
work
tired
you
will
put
your
arms
about
me
and
lay
your
head
on
my
shoulder
i
will
stroke
it
so
that
bonny
glossy
head
of
yours
alice
my
alice
all
mine
in
my
dream
never
to
be
mine
in
real
life
how
i
love
you
the
alice
behind
him
could
bear
no
more
she
gave
a
little
choking
cry
that
betrayed
her
presence
jasper
dale
sprang
up
and
gazed
upon
her
he
saw
her
standing
there
amid
the
languorous
shadows
of
august
pale
with
feeling
trembling
for
a
moment
shyness
wrung
him
then
every
trace
of
it
was
banished
by
a
sudden
strange
fierce
anger
that
swept
over
him
he
felt
outraged
and
hurt
to
the
death
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
cheated
out
of
something
incalculably
precious
as
if
sacrilege
had
been
done
to
his
most
holy
sanctuary
of
emotion
white
tense
with
his
anger
he
looked
at
her
and
spoke
his
lips
as
pale
as
if
his
fiery
words
scathed
them
how
dare
you
you
have
spied
on
me
you
have
crept
in
and
listened
how
dare
you
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
girl
you
have
destroyed
all
that
made
life
worth
while
to
me
my
dream
is
dead
it
could
not
live
when
it
was
betrayed
and
it
was
all
i
had
oh
laugh
at
me
mock
me
i
know
that
i
am
ridiculous
what
of
it
it
never
could
have
hurt
you
why
must
you
creep
in
like
this
to
hear
me
and
put
me
to
shame
oh
i
love
you
i
will
say
it
laugh
as
you
will
is
it
such
a
strange
thing
that
i
should
have
a
heart
like
other
men
this
will
make
sport
for
you
i
who
love
you
better
than
my
life
better
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
can
love
you
will
be
a
jest
to
you
all
your
life
i
love
you
and
yet
i
think
i
could
hate
you
you
have
destroyed
my
dream
you
have
done
me
deadly
jasper
jasper
cried
alice
finding
her
voice
his
anger
hurt
her
with
a
pain
she
could
not
endure
it
was
unbearable
that
jasper
should
be
angry
with
her
in
that
moment
she
realized
that
she
loved
him
that
the
words
he
had
spoken
when
unconscious
of
her
presence
were
the
sweetest
she
had
ever
heard
or
ever
could
hear
nothing
mattered
at
all
save
that
he
loved
her
and
was
angry
with
her
don
t
say
such
dreadful
things
to
me
she
stammered
i
did
not
mean
to
listen
i
could
not
help
it
i
shall
never
laugh
at
you
oh
jasper
she
looked
bravely
at
him
and
the
fine
soul
of
her
shone
through
the
flesh
like
an
illuminating
lamp
i
am
glad
that
you
love
me
and
i
am
glad
i
chanced
to
overhear
you
since
you
would
never
have
had
the
courage
to
tell
me
otherwise
glad
glad
do
you
understand
jasper
jasper
looked
at
her
with
the
eyes
of
one
who
looking
through
pain
sees
rapture
beyond
is
it
possible
he
said
wonderingly
alice
i
am
so
much
older
than
you
and
they
call
me
the
awkward
man
they
say
i
am
unlike
other
people
you
are
unlike
other
people
she
said
softly
and
that
is
why
i
love
you
i
know
now
that
i
must
have
loved
you
ever
since
i
saw
i
loved
you
long
before
i
saw
you
said
jasper
he
came
close
to
her
and
drew
her
into
his
arms
tenderly
and
reverently
all
his
shyness
and
awkwardness
swallowed
up
in
the
grace
of
his
great
happiness
in
the
old
garden
he
kissed
her
lips
and
alice
entered
into
her
own
chapter
xxvi
uncle
blair
comes
home
it
happened
that
the
story
girl
and
i
both
got
up
very
early
on
the
morning
of
the
awkward
man
s
wedding
day
uncle
alec
was
going
to
charlottetown
that
day
and
i
awakened
at
daybreak
by
the
sounds
in
the
kitchen
beneath
us
remembered
that
i
had
forgotten
to
ask
him
to
bring
me
a
certain
i
wanted
so
i
hurriedly
dressed
and
hastened
down
to
tell
him
before
he
went
i
was
joined
on
the
stairs
by
the
story
girl
who
said
she
had
wakened
and
not
feeling
like
going
to
sleep
again
thought
she
might
as
well
get
up
i
had
such
a
funny
dream
last
night
she
said
i
dreamed
that
i
heard
a
voice
calling
me
from
away
down
in
uncle
stephen
s
walk
sara
sara
sara
it
kept
calling
i
didn
t
know
whose
it
was
and
yet
it
seemed
like
a
voice
i
knew
i
wakened
up
while
it
was
calling
and
it
seemed
so
real
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
a
dream
it
was
bright
moonlight
and
i
felt
just
like
getting
up
and
going
out
to
the
orchard
but
i
knew
that
would
be
silly
and
of
course
i
didn
t
go
but
i
kept
on
wanting
to
and
i
couldn
t
sleep
any
more
wasn
t
it
queer
when
uncle
alec
had
gone
i
proposed
a
saunter
to
the
farther
end
of
the
orchard
where
i
had
left
a
book
the
preceding
evening
a
young
mom
was
walking
rosily
on
the
hills
as
we
passed
down
uncle
stephen
s
walk
with
paddy
trotting
before
us
high
overhead
was
the
blue
of
paling
skies
the
east
was
a
great
arc
of
crystal
smitten
through
with
auroral
crimsonings
just
above
it
was
one
star
of
morning
like
a
pearl
on
a
silver
sea
a
light
wind
of
dawn
was
weaving
an
orient
spell
it
s
lovely
to
be
up
as
early
as
this
isn
t
it
said
the
story
girl
the
world
seems
so
different
just
at
sunrise
doesn
t
it
it
makes
me
feel
just
like
getting
up
to
see
the
sun
rise
every
morning
of
my
life
after
this
but
i
know
i
won
t
i
ll
likely
sleep
later
than
ever
tomorrow
morning
but
i
wish
i
the
awkward
man
and
miss
reade
are
going
to
have
a
lovely
day
for
their
wedding
i
said
yes
and
i
m
so
glad
beautiful
alice
deserves
everything
good
why
bev
why
bev
who
is
that
in
the
hammock
i
looked
the
hammock
was
swung
under
the
two
end
trees
of
the
walk
in
it
a
man
was
lying
asleep
his
head
pillowed
on
his
overcoat
he
was
sleeping
easily
lightly
and
wholesomely
he
had
a
pointed
brown
beard
and
thick
wavy
brown
hair
his
cheeks
were
a
dusky
red
and
the
lashes
of
his
closed
eyes
were
as
long
and
dark
and
silken
as
a
girl
s
he
wore
a
light
gray
suit
and
on
the
slender
white
hand
that
hung
down
over
the
hammock
s
edge
was
a
spark
of
diamond
fire
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
knew
his
face
although
assuredly
i
had
never
seen
him
before
while
i
groped
among
vague
speculations
the
story
girl
gave
a
queer
choked
little
cry
the
next
moment
she
had
sprung
over
the
intervening
space
dropped
on
her
knees
by
the
hammock
and
flung
her
arms
about
the
man
s
neck
father
father
she
cried
while
i
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
in
my
amazement
the
sleeper
stirred
and
opened
two
large
exceedingly
brilliant
hazel
eyes
for
a
moment
he
gazed
rather
blankly
at
the
young
lady
who
was
embracing
him
then
a
most
delightful
smile
broke
over
his
face
he
sprang
up
and
caught
her
to
his
heart
sara
sara
my
little
sara
to
think
didn
t
know
you
at
first
glance
but
you
are
almost
a
woman
and
when
i
saw
you
last
you
were
just
a
little
girl
of
eight
my
own
little
sara
father
father
sometimes
i
ve
wondered
if
you
were
ever
coming
back
to
me
i
heard
the
story
girl
say
as
i
turned
and
scuttled
up
the
walk
realizing
that
i
was
not
wanted
there
just
then
and
would
be
little
missed
various
emotions
and
speculations
possessed
my
mind
in
my
retreat
but
chiefly
did
i
feel
a
sense
of
triumph
in
being
the
bearer
of
exciting
news
aunt
janet
uncle
blair
is
here
i
announced
breathlessly
at
the
kitchen
door
aunt
janet
who
was
kneading
her
bread
turned
round
and
lifted
floury
hands
felicity
and
cecily
who
were
just
entering
the
kitchen
rosy
from
slumber
stopped
still
and
stared
at
me
uncle
who
exclaimed
aunt
janet
uncle
blair
the
story
girl
s
father
you
know
he
s
where
down
in
the
orchard
he
was
asleep
in
the
hammock
we
found
him
dear
me
said
aunt
janet
sitting
down
helplessly
if
that
isn
t
like
blair
of
course
he
couldn
t
come
like
anybody
else
i
wonder
she
added
in
a
tone
unheard
by
anyone
else
save
myself
i
wonder
if
he
has
come
to
take
the
child
my
elation
went
out
like
a
snuffed
candle
i
had
never
thought
of
this
if
uncle
blair
took
the
story
girl
away
would
not
life
become
rather
savourless
on
the
hill
farm
i
turned
and
followed
felicity
and
cecily
out
in
a
very
subdued
mood
uncle
blair
and
the
story
girl
were
just
coming
out
of
the
orchard
his
arm
was
about
her
and
hers
was
on
his
shoulder
laughter
and
tears
were
contending
in
her
eyes
only
once
before
when
peter
had
come
back
from
the
valley
of
the
shadow
had
i
seen
the
story
girl
cry
emotion
had
to
go
very
deep
with
her
ere
it
touched
the
source
of
tears
i
had
always
known
that
she
loved
her
father
passionately
though
she
rarely
talked
of
him
understanding
that
her
uncles
and
aunts
were
not
his
friends
but
aunt
janet
s
welcome
was
cordial
enough
though
a
trifle
flustered
whatever
thrifty
farmer
folk
might
think
of
gay
bohemian
blair
stanley
in
his
absence
in
his
presence
even
they
liked
him
by
the
grace
of
some
winsome
lovable
quality
in
the
soul
of
him
he
had
a
way
with
him
revealed
even
in
the
manner
with
which
he
caught
staid
aunt
janet
in
his
arms
swung
her
matronly
form
around
as
though
she
had
been
a
slim
schoolgirl
and
kissed
her
rosy
cheek
sister
o
mine
are
you
never
going
to
grow
old
he
said
here
you
are
at
with
the
roses
of
sixteen
and
not
a
gray
hair
i
ll
blair
blair
it
is
you
who
are
always
young
laughed
aunt
janet
not
ill
pleased
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
and
what
is
this
i
hear
of
your
sleeping
all
night
in
the
hammock
i
ve
been
painting
in
the
lake
district
all
summer
as
you
know
answered
uncle
blair
and
one
day
i
just
got
homesick
to
see
my
little
girl
so
i
sailed
for
montreal
without
further
delay
i
got
here
at
eleven
last
night
the
s
son
drove
me
down
nice
boy
the
old
house
was
in
darkness
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
shame
to
rouse
you
all
out
of
bed
after
a
hard
day
s
work
so
i
decided
that
i
would
spend
the
night
in
the
orchard
it
was
moonlight
you
know
and
moonlight
in
an
old
orchard
is
one
of
the
few
things
left
over
from
the
golden
it
was
very
foolish
of
you
said
practical
aunt
janet
these
september
nights
are
real
chilly
you
might
have
caught
your
death
of
cold
or
a
bad
dose
of
so
i
might
no
doubt
it
was
foolish
of
me
agreed
uncle
blair
gaily
it
must
have
been
the
fault
of
the
moonlight
moonlight
you
know
sister
janet
has
an
intoxicating
quality
it
is
a
fine
airy
silver
wine
such
as
fairies
may
drink
at
their
revels
unharmed
of
it
but
when
a
mere
mortal
sips
of
it
it
mounts
straightway
to
his
brain
to
the
undoing
of
his
daylight
common
sense
however
i
have
got
neither
cold
nor
rheumatism
as
a
sensible
person
would
have
done
had
he
ever
been
lured
into
doing
such
a
thing
there
is
a
special
providence
for
us
foolish
folk
i
enjoyed
my
night
in
the
orchard
for
a
time
i
was
companioned
by
sweet
old
memories
and
then
i
fell
asleep
listening
to
the
murmurs
of
the
wind
in
those
old
trees
yonder
and
i
had
a
beautiful
dream
janet
i
dreamed
that
the
old
orchard
blossomed
again
as
it
did
that
spring
eighteen
years
ago
i
dreamed
that
its
sunshine
was
the
sunshine
of
spring
not
autumn
there
was
newness
of
life
in
my
dream
janet
and
the
sweetness
of
forgotten
wasn
t
it
strange
about
my
dream
whispered
the
story
girl
to
me
well
you
d
better
come
in
and
have
some
breakfast
said
aunt
janet
these
are
my
little
girls
felicity
and
i
remember
them
as
two
most
adorable
tots
said
uncle
blair
shaking
hands
they
haven
t
changed
quite
so
much
as
my
own
why
she
s
a
woman
janet
she
s
a
she
s
child
enough
still
said
aunt
janet
hastily
the
story
girl
shook
her
long
brown
curls
i
m
fifteen
she
said
and
you
ought
to
see
me
in
my
long
dress
we
must
not
be
separated
any
longer
dear
heart
i
heard
uncle
blair
say
tenderly
i
hoped
that
he
meant
he
would
stay
in
canada
not
that
he
would
take
the
story
girl
away
apart
from
this
we
had
a
gay
day
with
uncle
blair
he
evidently
liked
our
society
better
than
that
of
the
for
he
was
a
child
himself
at
heart
gay
irresponsible
always
acting
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
we
all
found
him
a
delightful
companion
there
was
no
school
that
day
as
perkins
was
absent
attending
a
meeting
of
the
teachers
convention
so
we
spent
most
of
its
golden
hours
in
the
orchard
with
uncle
blair
listening
to
his
fascinating
accounts
of
foreign
wanderings
he
also
drew
all
our
pictures
for
us
and
this
was
especially
delightful
for
the
day
of
the
camera
was
only
just
dawning
and
none
of
us
had
ever
had
even
our
photographs
taken
sara
ray
s
pleasure
was
as
usual
quite
spoiled
by
wondering
what
her
mother
would
say
of
it
for
ray
had
so
it
appeared
some
very
peculiar
prejudices
against
the
taking
or
making
of
any
kind
of
picture
whatsoever
owing
to
an
exceedingly
strict
interpretation
of
the
second
commandment
dan
suggested
that
she
need
not
tell
her
mother
anything
about
it
but
sara
shook
her
head
i
ll
have
to
tell
her
i
ve
made
it
a
rule
to
tell
ma
everything
i
do
ever
since
the
judgment
besides
added
cecily
seriously
the
family
guide
says
one
ought
to
tell
one
s
mother
it
s
pretty
hard
sometimes
though
sighed
sara
ma
scolds
so
much
when
i
do
tell
her
things
that
it
sort
of
discourages
me
but
when
i
think
of
how
dreadful
i
felt
the
time
of
the
judgment
day
over
deceiving
her
in
some
things
it
nerves
me
up
i
d
do
almost
anything
rather
than
feel
like
that
the
next
time
the
judgment
day
fe
fi
fo
fum
i
smell
a
story
said
uncle
blair
what
do
you
mean
by
speaking
of
the
judgment
day
in
the
past
tense
the
story
girl
told
him
the
tale
of
that
dreadful
sunday
in
the
preceding
summer
and
we
all
laughed
with
him
at
ourselves
all
the
same
muttered
peter
i
don
t
want
to
have
another
experience
like
that
i
hope
i
ll
be
dead
the
next
time
the
judgment
day
but
you
ll
be
raised
up
for
it
said
felix
oh
that
ll
be
all
right
i
won
t
mind
that
i
won
t
know
anything
about
it
till
it
really
happens
it
s
the
expecting
it
that
s
the
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
talk
of
such
things
said
felicity
when
evening
came
we
all
went
to
golden
milestone
we
knew
the
awkward
man
and
his
bride
were
expected
home
at
sunset
and
we
meant
to
scatter
flowers
on
the
path
by
which
she
must
enter
her
new
home
it
was
the
story
girl
s
idea
but
i
don
t
think
aunt
janet
would
have
let
us
go
if
uncle
blair
had
not
pleaded
for
us
he
asked
to
be
taken
along
too
and
we
agreed
if
he
would
stand
out
of
sight
when
the
newly
married
pair
came
home
you
see
father
the
awkward
man
won
t
mind
us
because
we
re
only
children
and
he
knows
us
well
explained
the
story
girl
but
if
he
sees
you
a
stranger
it
might
confuse
him
and
we
might
spoil
the
homecoming
and
that
would
be
such
a
so
we
went
to
golden
milestone
laden
with
all
the
flowery
spoil
we
could
plunder
from
both
gardens
it
was
a
clear
september
evening
and
far
away
over
markdale
harbour
a
great
round
red
moon
was
rising
as
we
waited
uncle
blair
was
hidden
behind
the
tassels
of
the
pines
at
the
gate
but
he
and
the
story
girl
kept
waving
their
hands
at
each
other
and
calling
out
gay
mirthful
jests
do
you
really
feel
acquainted
with
your
father
whispered
sara
ray
wonderingly
it
s
long
since
you
saw
if
i
hadn
t
seen
him
for
a
hundred
years
it
wouldn
t
make
any
difference
that
way
laughed
the
story
girl
they
re
coming
whispered
felicity
excitedly
and
then
they
came
beautiful
alice
blushing
and
lovely
in
the
prettiest
of
pretty
blue
dresses
and
the
awkward
man
so
fervently
happy
that
he
quite
forgot
to
be
awkward
he
lifted
her
out
of
the
buggy
gallantly
and
led
her
forward
to
us
smiling
we
retreated
before
them
scattering
our
flowers
lavishly
on
the
path
and
alice
dale
walked
to
the
very
doorstep
of
her
new
home
over
a
carpet
of
blossoms
on
the
step
they
both
paused
and
turned
towards
us
and
we
shyly
did
the
proper
thing
in
the
way
of
congratulations
and
good
wishes
it
was
so
sweet
of
you
to
do
this
said
the
smiling
bride
it
was
lovely
to
be
able
to
do
it
for
you
dearest
whispered
the
story
girl
and
oh
miss
reade
dale
i
mean
we
all
hope
you
ll
be
so
so
happy
for
i
am
sure
i
shall
said
alice
dale
turning
to
her
husband
he
looked
down
into
her
eyes
and
we
were
quite
forgotten
by
both
of
them
we
saw
it
and
slipped
away
while
jasper
dale
drew
his
wife
into
their
home
and
shut
the
world
out
we
scampered
joyously
away
through
the
moonlit
dusk
uncle
blair
joined
us
at
the
gate
and
the
story
girl
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
bride
when
she
dies
white
violets
will
grow
out
of
her
dust
he
answered
uncle
blair
says
even
queerer
things
than
the
story
girl
felicity
whispered
to
me
and
so
that
beautiful
day
went
away
from
us
slipping
through
our
fingers
as
we
tried
to
hold
it
it
hooded
itself
in
shadows
and
fared
forth
on
the
road
that
is
lighted
by
the
white
stars
of
evening
it
had
been
a
gift
of
paradise
its
hours
had
all
been
fair
and
beloved
from
dawn
flush
to
fall
of
night
there
had
been
naught
to
mar
it
it
took
with
it
its
smiles
and
laughter
but
it
left
the
boon
of
memory
chapter
xxvii
the
old
order
changeth
i
am
going
away
with
father
when
he
goes
he
is
going
to
spend
the
winter
in
paris
and
i
am
to
go
to
school
the
story
girl
told
us
this
one
day
in
the
orchard
there
was
a
little
elation
in
her
tone
but
more
regret
the
news
was
not
a
great
surprise
to
us
we
had
felt
it
in
the
air
ever
since
uncle
blair
s
arrival
aunt
janet
had
been
very
unwilling
to
let
the
story
girl
go
but
uncle
blair
was
inexorable
it
was
time
he
said
that
she
should
go
to
a
better
school
than
the
little
country
one
in
carlisle
and
besides
he
did
not
want
her
to
grow
into
womanhood
a
stranger
to
him
so
it
was
finally
decided
that
she
was
to
go
just
think
you
are
going
to
europe
said
sara
ray
in
an
tone
won
t
that
be
splendid
i
suppose
i
ll
like
it
after
a
while
said
the
story
girl
slowly
but
i
know
i
ll
be
dreadfully
homesick
at
first
of
course
it
will
be
lovely
to
be
with
father
but
oh
i
ll
miss
the
rest
of
you
so
much
just
think
how
we
ll
miss
you
sighed
cecily
it
will
be
so
lonesome
here
this
winter
with
you
and
peter
both
gone
oh
dear
i
do
wish
things
didn
t
have
to
felicity
said
nothing
she
kept
looking
down
at
the
grass
on
which
she
sat
absently
pulling
at
the
slender
blades
presently
we
saw
two
big
tears
roll
down
over
her
cheeks
the
story
girl
looked
surprised
are
you
crying
because
i
m
going
away
felicity
she
asked
of
course
i
am
answered
felicity
with
a
big
sob
do
you
think
i
ve
no
i
didn
t
think
you
d
care
much
said
the
story
girl
frankly
you
ve
never
seemed
to
like
me
very
i
t
wear
my
on
my
sleeve
said
poor
felicity
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
i
think
you
stay
your
father
would
let
you
if
you
well
you
see
i
d
have
to
go
some
time
sighed
the
story
girl
and
the
longer
it
was
put
off
the
harder
it
would
be
but
i
do
feel
dreadfully
about
it
i
can
t
even
take
poor
paddy
i
ll
have
to
leave
him
behind
and
oh
i
want
you
all
to
promise
to
be
kind
to
him
for
my
we
all
solemnly
assured
her
that
we
would
i
ll
him
cream
every
and
sobbed
felicity
but
i
ll
never
be
able
to
look
at
him
without
crying
he
ll
make
me
think
of
well
i
m
not
going
right
away
said
the
story
girl
more
cheerfully
not
till
the
last
of
october
so
we
have
over
a
month
yet
to
have
a
good
time
in
let
s
all
just
determine
to
make
it
a
splendid
month
for
the
last
we
won
t
think
about
my
going
at
all
till
we
have
to
and
we
won
t
have
any
quarrels
among
us
and
we
ll
just
enjoy
ourselves
all
we
possibly
can
so
don
t
cry
any
more
felicity
i
m
awfully
glad
you
do
like
me
and
am
sorry
i
m
going
away
but
let
s
all
forget
it
for
a
felicity
sighed
and
tucked
away
her
damp
handkerchief
it
isn
t
so
easy
for
me
to
forget
things
but
i
ll
try
she
said
disconsolately
and
if
you
want
any
more
cooking
lessons
before
you
go
i
ll
be
real
glad
to
teach
you
anything
i
this
was
a
high
plane
of
for
felicity
to
attain
but
the
story
girl
shook
her
head
no
i
m
not
going
to
bother
my
head
about
cooking
lessons
this
last
month
it
s
too
do
you
remember
the
time
you
made
the
pudding
began
peter
and
suddenly
stopped
out
of
sawdust
finished
the
story
girl
cheerfully
you
needn
t
be
afraid
to
mention
it
to
me
after
this
i
don
t
mind
any
more
i
begin
to
see
the
fun
of
it
now
i
should
think
i
do
remember
it
and
the
time
i
baked
the
bread
before
it
was
raised
people
have
made
worse
mistakes
than
that
said
felicity
kindly
such
as
using
but
here
dan
stopped
abruptly
remembering
the
story
girl
s
plea
for
a
beautiful
month
felicity
coloured
but
said
nothing
did
not
even
look
anything
we
have
had
lots
of
fun
together
one
way
or
another
said
cecily
retrospectively
just
think
how
much
we
ve
laughed
this
last
year
or
so
said
the
story
girl
we
ve
had
good
times
together
but
i
think
we
ll
have
lots
more
splendid
years
eden
is
always
behind
us
paradise
always
before
said
uncle
blair
coming
up
in
time
to
hear
her
he
said
it
with
a
sigh
that
was
immediately
lost
in
one
of
his
delightful
smiles
i
like
uncle
blair
so
much
better
than
i
expected
to
felicity
confided
to
me
mother
says
he
s
a
rolling
stone
but
there
really
is
something
very
nice
about
him
although
he
says
a
great
many
things
i
don
t
understand
i
suppose
the
story
girl
will
have
a
very
gay
time
in
she
s
going
to
school
and
she
ll
have
to
study
hard
i
said
she
says
she
s
going
to
study
for
the
stage
said
felicity
uncle
roger
thinks
it
is
all
right
and
says
she
ll
be
very
famous
some
day
but
mother
thinks
it
s
dreadful
and
so
do
aunt
julia
is
a
concert
singer
i
said
oh
that
s
very
different
but
i
hope
poor
sara
will
get
on
all
right
sighed
felicity
you
never
know
what
may
happen
to
a
person
in
those
foreign
countries
and
everybody
says
paris
is
such
a
wicked
place
but
we
must
hope
for
the
best
she
concluded
in
a
resigned
tone
that
evening
the
story
girl
and
i
drove
the
cows
to
pasture
after
milking
and
when
we
came
home
we
sought
out
uncle
blair
in
the
orchard
he
was
sauntering
up
and
down
uncle
stephen
s
walk
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
beautiful
youthful
face
uplifted
to
the
western
sky
where
waves
of
night
were
breaking
on
a
dim
primrose
shore
of
sunset
see
that
star
over
there
in
the
he
said
as
we
joined
him
the
one
just
above
that
pine
an
evening
star
shining
over
a
dark
pine
tree
is
the
whitest
thing
in
the
universe
because
it
is
living
whiteness
whiteness
possessing
a
soul
how
full
this
old
orchard
is
of
twilight
do
you
know
i
have
been
trysting
here
with
the
family
ghost
i
asked
very
stupidly
no
not
the
family
ghost
i
never
saw
beautiful
emily
yet
your
mother
saw
her
once
sara
that
was
a
strange
thing
he
added
absently
as
if
to
himself
did
mother
really
see
her
whispered
the
story
girl
well
she
always
believed
she
did
who
knows
do
you
think
there
are
such
things
as
ghosts
uncle
blair
i
asked
curiously
i
never
saw
any
but
you
said
you
were
trysting
with
ghosts
here
this
evening
said
the
story
girl
oh
yes
the
ghosts
of
the
old
years
i
love
this
orchard
because
of
its
many
ghosts
we
are
good
comrades
those
ghosts
and
i
we
walk
and
talk
we
even
laugh
together
sorrowful
laughter
that
has
sorrow
s
own
sweetness
and
always
there
comes
to
me
one
dear
phantom
and
wanders
hand
in
hand
with
me
a
lost
lady
of
the
old
my
mother
said
the
story
girl
very
softly
yes
your
mother
here
in
her
old
haunts
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
believe
that
she
can
be
dead
that
her
laughter
can
be
dead
she
was
the
gayest
sweetest
thing
and
so
young
only
three
years
older
than
you
sara
yonder
old
house
had
been
glad
because
of
her
for
eighteen
years
when
i
met
her
i
wish
i
could
remember
her
said
the
story
girl
with
a
little
sigh
i
haven
t
even
a
picture
of
her
why
didn
t
you
paint
one
father
she
would
never
let
me
she
had
some
queer
funny
superstition
about
it
but
i
always
meant
to
when
she
would
become
willing
to
let
me
and
then
she
died
her
twin
brother
felix
died
the
same
day
there
was
something
strange
about
that
too
i
was
holding
her
in
my
arms
and
she
was
looking
up
at
me
suddenly
she
looked
past
me
and
gave
a
little
start
felix
she
said
for
a
moment
she
trembled
and
then
she
smiled
and
looked
up
at
me
again
a
little
beseechingly
felix
has
come
for
me
dear
she
said
we
were
always
together
before
you
came
you
must
not
mind
you
must
be
glad
i
do
not
have
to
go
well
who
knows
but
she
left
me
sara
she
left
there
was
that
in
uncle
blair
s
voice
that
kept
us
silent
for
a
time
then
the
story
girl
said
still
very
softly
what
did
mother
look
like
father
i
don
t
look
the
least
little
bit
like
her
do
i
no
i
wish
you
did
you
brown
thing
your
mother
s
face
was
as
white
as
a
with
only
a
faint
dream
of
rose
in
her
cheeks
she
had
the
eyes
of
one
who
always
had
a
song
in
her
heart
blue
as
a
mist
those
eyes
were
she
had
dark
lashes
and
a
little
red
mouth
that
quivered
when
she
was
very
sad
or
very
happy
like
a
crimson
rose
too
rudely
shaken
by
the
wind
she
was
as
slim
and
lithe
as
a
young
birch
tree
how
i
loved
her
how
happy
we
were
but
he
who
accepts
human
love
must
bind
it
to
his
soul
with
pain
and
she
is
not
lost
to
me
nothing
is
ever
really
lost
to
us
as
long
as
we
remember
uncle
blair
looked
up
at
the
evening
star
we
saw
that
he
had
forgotten
us
and
we
slipped
away
hand
in
hand
leaving
him
alone
in
the
shadows
of
the
old
orchard
chapter
xxviii
the
path
to
arcady
october
that
year
gathered
up
all
the
spilled
sunshine
of
the
summer
and
clad
herself
in
it
as
in
a
garment
the
story
girl
had
asked
us
to
try
to
make
the
last
month
together
beautiful
and
nature
seconded
our
efforts
giving
us
that
most
beautiful
of
beautiful
things
a
gracious
and
perfect
moon
of
falling
leaves
there
was
not
in
all
that
vanished
october
one
day
that
did
not
come
in
with
auroral
splendour
and
go
out
attended
by
a
fair
galaxy
of
evening
stars
not
a
day
when
there
were
not
golden
lights
in
the
wide
pastures
and
purple
hazes
in
the
ripened
distances
never
was
anything
so
gorgeous
as
the
maple
trees
that
year
maples
are
trees
that
have
primeval
fire
in
their
souls
it
glows
out
a
little
in
their
early
youth
before
the
leaves
open
in
the
redness
and
of
their
blossoms
but
in
summer
it
is
carefully
hidden
under
a
demure
greenness
then
when
autumn
comes
the
maples
give
up
trying
to
be
sober
and
flame
out
in
all
the
barbaric
splendour
and
gorgeousness
of
their
real
nature
making
of
the
hills
things
out
of
an
arabian
nights
dream
in
the
golden
prime
of
good
haroun
alraschid
you
may
never
know
what
scarlet
and
crimson
really
are
until
you
see
them
in
their
perfection
on
an
october
hillside
under
the
unfathomable
blue
of
an
autumn
sky
all
the
glow
and
radiance
and
joy
at
earth
s
heart
seem
to
have
broken
loose
in
a
splendid
determination
to
express
itself
for
once
before
the
frost
of
winter
chills
her
beating
pulses
it
is
the
year
s
carnival
ere
the
dull
lenten
days
of
leafless
valleys
and
penitential
mists
come
the
time
of
had
come
around
once
more
and
we
worked
joyously
uncle
blair
picked
apples
with
us
and
between
him
and
the
story
girl
it
was
an
october
never
to
be
forgotten
will
you
go
far
afield
for
a
walk
with
me
he
said
to
her
and
me
one
idle
afternoon
of
opal
skies
pied
meadows
and
misty
hills
it
was
saturday
and
peter
had
gone
home
felix
and
dan
were
helping
uncle
alec
top
turnips
cecily
and
felicity
were
making
cookies
for
sunday
so
the
story
girl
and
i
were
alone
in
uncle
stephen
s
walk
we
liked
to
be
alone
together
that
last
month
to
think
the
long
long
thoughts
of
youth
and
talk
about
our
futures
there
had
grown
up
between
us
that
summer
a
bond
of
sympathy
that
did
not
exist
between
us
and
the
others
we
were
older
than
they
the
story
girl
was
fifteen
and
i
was
nearly
that
and
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
immeasurably
older
than
the
rest
and
possessed
of
dreams
and
visions
and
hopes
which
they
could
not
possibly
share
or
understand
at
times
we
were
still
children
still
interested
in
childish
things
but
there
came
hours
when
we
seemed
to
our
two
selves
very
grown
up
and
old
and
in
those
hours
we
talked
our
dreams
and
visions
and
hopes
vague
and
splendid
as
all
such
are
over
together
and
so
began
to
build
up
out
of
the
rainbow
fragments
of
our
childhood
s
companionship
that
rare
and
beautiful
friendship
which
was
to
last
all
our
lives
enriching
and
enstarring
them
for
there
is
no
bond
more
lasting
than
that
formed
by
the
mutual
confidences
of
that
magic
time
when
youth
is
slipping
from
the
sheath
of
childhood
and
beginning
to
wonder
what
lies
for
it
beyond
those
misty
hills
that
bound
the
golden
road
where
are
you
going
asked
the
story
girl
to
the
woods
that
belt
the
gray
hillside
ay
and
overflow
beyond
it
into
many
a
valley
in
immemorial
peace
answered
uncle
blair
i
have
a
fancy
for
one
more
ramble
in
prince
edward
island
woods
before
i
leave
canada
again
but
i
would
not
go
alone
so
come
you
two
gay
youthful
things
to
whom
all
life
is
yet
fair
and
good
and
we
will
seek
the
path
to
arcady
there
will
be
many
little
things
along
our
way
to
make
us
glad
joyful
sounds
will
come
ringing
down
the
wind
a
wealth
of
gypsy
gold
will
be
ours
for
the
gathering
we
will
learn
the
potent
unutterable
charm
of
a
dim
spruce
wood
and
the
grace
of
flexile
mountain
ashes
fringing
a
lonely
glen
we
will
tryst
with
the
folk
of
fur
and
feather
we
ll
hearken
to
the
music
of
gray
old
firs
come
and
you
ll
have
a
ramble
and
an
afternoon
that
you
will
both
remember
all
your
we
did
have
it
never
has
its
remembrance
faded
that
idyllic
afternoon
of
roving
in
the
old
carlisle
woods
with
the
story
girl
and
uncle
blair
gleams
in
my
book
of
years
a
page
of
living
beauty
yet
it
was
but
a
few
hours
of
simplest
pleasure
we
wandered
pathlessly
through
the
sylvan
calm
of
those
dear
places
which
seemed
that
day
to
be
full
of
a
great
friendliness
uncle
blair
sauntered
along
behind
us
whistling
softly
sometimes
he
talked
to
himself
we
delighted
in
those
brief
reveries
of
his
uncle
blair
was
the
only
man
i
have
ever
known
who
could
when
he
so
willed
talk
like
a
book
and
do
it
without
seeming
ridiculous
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
the
knack
of
choosing
fit
audience
though
few
and
the
proper
time
to
appeal
to
that
audience
we
went
across
the
fields
intending
to
skirt
the
woods
at
the
back
of
uncle
alec
s
farm
and
find
a
lane
that
cut
through
uncle
roger
s
woods
but
before
we
came
to
it
we
stumbled
on
a
sly
winding
little
path
quite
by
accident
if
indeed
there
can
be
such
a
thing
as
accident
in
the
woods
where
i
am
tempted
to
think
we
are
led
by
the
good
people
along
such
of
their
fairy
ways
as
they
have
a
mind
for
us
to
walk
in
go
to
let
us
explore
this
said
uncle
blair
it
always
drags
terribly
at
my
heart
to
go
past
a
wood
lane
if
i
can
make
any
excuse
at
all
for
traversing
it
for
it
is
the
that
lead
to
the
heart
of
the
woods
and
we
must
follow
them
if
we
would
know
the
forest
and
be
known
of
it
when
we
can
really
feel
its
wild
heart
beating
against
ours
its
subtle
life
will
steal
into
our
veins
and
make
us
its
own
for
ever
so
that
no
matter
where
we
go
or
how
wide
we
wander
in
the
noisy
ways
of
cities
or
over
the
lone
ways
of
the
sea
we
shall
yet
be
drawn
back
to
the
forest
to
find
our
most
enduring
i
always
feel
so
satisfied
in
the
woods
said
the
story
girl
dreamily
as
we
turned
in
under
the
fir
boughs
trees
seem
such
friendly
they
are
the
most
friendly
things
in
god
s
good
creation
said
uncle
blair
emphatically
and
it
is
so
easy
to
live
with
them
to
hold
converse
with
pines
to
whisper
secrets
with
the
poplars
to
listen
to
the
tales
of
old
romance
that
beeches
have
to
tell
to
walk
in
eloquent
silence
with
firs
is
to
learn
what
real
companionship
is
besides
trees
are
the
same
all
over
the
world
a
beech
tree
on
the
slopes
of
the
pyrenees
is
just
what
a
beech
tree
here
in
these
carlisle
woods
is
and
there
used
to
be
an
old
pine
hereabouts
whose
twin
brother
i
was
well
acquainted
with
in
a
dell
among
the
apennines
listen
to
those
squirrels
will
you
chattering
over
yonder
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
fuss
over
nothing
squirrels
are
the
gossips
and
busybodies
of
the
woods
they
haven
t
learned
the
fine
reserve
of
its
other
denizens
but
after
all
there
is
a
certain
shrill
friendliness
in
their
they
seem
to
be
scolding
us
i
said
laughing
oh
they
are
not
half
such
scolds
as
they
sound
answered
uncle
blair
gaily
if
they
would
but
tak
a
thought
and
mend
their
ways
they
would
be
dear
lovable
creatures
if
i
had
to
be
an
animal
i
think
i
d
like
to
be
a
squirrel
said
the
story
girl
it
must
be
next
best
thing
to
just
see
what
a
spring
that
fellow
gave
laughed
uncle
blair
and
now
listen
to
his
song
of
triumph
i
suppose
that
chasm
he
cleared
seemed
as
wide
and
deep
to
him
as
niagara
gorge
would
to
us
if
we
leaped
over
it
well
the
wood
people
are
a
happy
folk
and
very
well
satisfied
with
those
who
have
followed
a
dim
winding
balsamic
path
to
the
unexpected
hollow
where
a
lies
have
found
the
rarest
secret
the
forest
can
reveal
such
was
our
good
fortune
that
day
at
the
end
of
our
path
we
found
it
under
the
pines
a
thing
with
lips
unkissed
by
so
much
as
a
stray
sunbeam
it
is
easy
to
dream
that
this
is
one
of
the
haunted
springs
of
old
romance
said
uncle
blair
tis
an
enchanted
spot
this
i
am
very
sure
and
we
should
go
softly
speaking
low
lest
we
disturb
the
rest
of
a
white
wet
naiad
or
break
some
spell
that
has
cost
long
years
of
mystic
it
s
so
easy
to
believe
things
in
the
woods
said
the
story
girl
shaping
a
cup
from
a
bit
of
birch
bark
and
filling
it
at
the
spring
drink
a
toast
in
that
water
sara
said
uncle
blair
there
s
not
a
doubt
that
it
has
some
potent
quality
of
magic
in
it
and
the
wish
you
wish
over
it
will
come
the
story
girl
lifted
her
flagon
to
her
red
lips
her
hazel
eyes
laughed
at
us
over
the
brim
here
s
to
our
futures
she
cried
i
wish
that
every
day
of
our
lives
may
be
better
than
the
one
that
went
an
extravagant
wish
a
very
wish
of
youth
commented
uncle
blair
and
yet
in
spite
of
its
extravagance
a
wish
that
will
come
true
if
you
are
true
to
yourselves
in
that
case
every
day
will
be
better
than
all
that
went
before
but
there
will
be
many
days
dear
lad
and
lass
when
you
will
not
believe
we
did
not
understand
him
but
we
knew
uncle
blair
never
explained
his
meaning
when
asked
it
he
was
wont
to
answer
with
a
smile
some
day
you
ll
grow
to
it
wait
for
so
we
addressed
ourselves
to
follow
the
brook
that
stole
away
from
the
spring
in
its
windings
and
doublings
and
tricky
surprises
a
brook
quoth
uncle
blair
is
the
most
changeful
bewitching
lovable
thing
in
the
world
it
is
never
in
the
same
mind
or
mood
two
minutes
here
it
is
sighing
and
murmuring
as
if
its
heart
were
broken
but
listen
yonder
by
the
birches
it
is
laughing
as
if
it
were
enjoying
some
capital
joke
all
by
it
was
indeed
a
changeful
brook
here
it
would
make
a
pool
dark
and
brooding
and
still
where
we
bent
to
look
at
our
mirrored
faces
then
it
grew
communicative
and
gossiped
shallowly
over
a
broken
pebble
bed
where
there
was
a
diamond
dance
of
sunbeams
and
no
troutling
or
minnow
could
glide
through
without
being
seen
sometimes
its
banks
were
high
and
steep
hung
with
slender
ashes
and
birches
again
they
were
mere
low
margins
green
with
delicate
mosses
shelving
out
of
the
wood
once
it
came
to
a
little
precipice
and
flung
itself
over
undauntedly
in
an
indignation
of
foam
gathering
itself
up
rather
dizzily
among
the
mossy
stones
below
it
was
some
time
before
it
got
over
its
vexation
it
went
boiling
and
muttering
along
fighting
with
the
rotten
logs
that
lie
across
it
and
making
far
more
fuss
than
was
necessary
over
every
root
that
interfered
with
it
we
were
getting
tired
of
its
and
talked
of
leaving
it
when
it
suddenly
grew
again
swooped
around
a
curve
and
presto
we
were
in
fairyland
it
was
a
little
dell
far
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
a
row
of
birches
fringed
the
brook
and
each
birch
seemed
more
exquisitely
graceful
and
golden
than
her
sisters
the
woods
receded
from
it
on
every
hand
leaving
it
lying
in
a
pool
of
amber
sunshine
the
yellow
trees
were
mirrored
in
the
placid
stream
with
now
and
then
a
leaf
falling
on
the
water
mayhap
to
drift
away
and
be
used
as
uncle
blair
suggested
by
some
adventurous
wood
sprite
who
had
it
in
mind
to
fare
forth
to
some
legendary
region
where
all
the
brooks
ran
into
the
sea
oh
what
a
lovely
place
i
exclaimed
looking
around
me
with
delight
a
spell
of
eternity
is
woven
over
it
surely
murmured
uncle
blair
winter
may
not
touch
it
or
spring
ever
revisit
it
it
should
be
like
this
for
let
us
never
come
here
again
said
the
story
girl
softly
never
no
matter
how
often
we
may
be
in
carlisle
then
we
will
never
see
it
changed
or
different
we
can
always
remember
it
just
as
we
see
it
now
and
it
will
be
like
this
for
ever
for
i
m
going
to
sketch
it
said
uncle
blair
while
he
sketched
it
the
story
girl
and
i
sat
on
the
banks
of
the
brook
and
she
told
me
the
story
of
the
sighing
reed
it
was
a
very
simple
little
story
that
of
the
slender
brown
reed
which
grew
by
the
forest
pool
and
always
was
sad
and
sighing
because
it
could
not
utter
music
like
the
brook
and
the
birds
and
the
winds
all
the
bright
beautiful
things
around
it
mocked
it
and
laughed
at
it
for
its
folly
who
would
ever
look
for
music
in
it
a
plain
brown
unbeautiful
thing
but
one
day
a
youth
came
through
the
wood
he
was
as
beautiful
as
the
spring
he
cut
the
brown
reed
and
fashioned
it
according
to
his
liking
and
then
he
put
it
to
his
lips
and
breathed
on
it
and
oh
the
music
that
floated
through
the
forest
it
was
so
entrancing
that
everything
brooks
and
birds
and
winds
grew
silent
to
listen
to
it
never
had
anything
so
lovely
been
heard
it
was
the
music
that
had
for
so
long
been
shut
up
in
the
soul
of
the
sighing
reed
and
was
set
free
at
last
through
its
pain
and
suffering
i
had
heard
the
story
girl
tell
many
a
more
dramatic
tale
but
that
one
stands
out
for
me
in
memory
above
them
all
partly
perhaps
because
of
the
spot
in
which
she
told
it
partly
because
it
was
the
last
one
i
was
to
hear
her
tell
for
many
years
the
last
one
she
was
ever
to
tell
me
on
the
golden
road
when
uncle
blair
had
finished
his
sketch
the
shafts
of
sunshine
were
turning
crimson
and
growing
more
and
more
remote
the
early
autumn
twilight
was
falling
over
the
woods
we
left
our
dell
saying
to
it
for
ever
as
the
story
girl
had
suggested
and
we
went
slowly
homeward
through
the
fir
woods
where
a
haunting
indescribable
odour
stole
out
to
meet
us
there
is
magic
in
the
scent
of
dying
fir
uncle
blair
was
saying
aloud
to
himself
as
if
forgetting
he
was
not
quite
alone
it
gets
into
our
blood
like
some
rare
wine
and
thrills
us
with
unutterable
sweetnesses
as
of
recollections
from
some
other
fairer
life
lived
in
some
happier
star
compared
to
it
all
other
scents
seem
heavy
and
luring
to
the
valleys
instead
of
the
heights
but
the
tang
of
the
fir
summons
onward
and
upward
to
some
divine
event
some
spiritual
peak
of
attainment
whence
we
shall
see
with
unfaltering
unclouded
vision
the
spires
of
some
aerial
city
beautiful
or
the
fulfilment
of
some
fair
fadeless
land
of
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
added
in
a
lower
tone
felicity
you
loved
the
scent
of
dying
fir
if
you
were
here
tonight
with
me
felicity
felicity
something
in
his
voice
made
me
suddenly
sad
i
was
comforted
when
i
felt
the
story
girl
slip
her
hand
into
mine
so
we
walked
out
of
the
woods
into
the
autumn
dusk
we
were
in
a
little
valley
up
the
opposite
slope
a
brush
fire
was
burning
clearly
and
steadily
in
a
maple
grove
there
was
something
indescribably
alluring
in
that
fire
glowing
so
redly
against
the
dark
background
of
forest
and
twilit
hill
let
us
go
to
it
cried
uncle
blair
gaily
casting
aside
his
sorrowful
mood
and
catching
our
hands
a
wood
fire
at
night
has
a
fascination
not
to
be
resisted
by
those
of
mortal
race
hasten
we
must
not
lose
oh
it
will
burn
a
long
time
yet
i
gasped
for
uncle
blair
was
whisking
us
up
the
hill
at
a
merciless
rate
you
can
t
be
sure
it
may
have
been
lighted
by
some
good
honest
bent
on
tidying
up
his
sugar
orchard
but
it
may
also
for
anything
we
know
have
been
kindled
by
no
earthly
woodman
as
a
beacon
or
summons
to
the
tribes
of
fairyland
and
may
vanish
away
if
we
it
did
not
vanish
and
presently
we
found
ourselves
in
the
grove
it
was
very
beautiful
the
fire
burned
with
a
clear
steady
glow
and
a
soft
crackle
the
long
arcades
beneath
the
trees
were
illuminated
with
a
rosy
radiance
beyond
which
lurked
companies
of
gray
and
purple
shadows
everything
was
very
still
and
dreamy
and
remote
it
is
impossible
that
out
there
just
over
the
hill
lies
a
village
of
men
where
tame
household
lamps
are
shining
said
uncle
blair
i
feel
as
if
we
must
be
thousands
of
miles
away
from
everything
we
ve
ever
known
murmured
the
story
girl
so
you
are
said
uncle
blair
emphatically
you
re
back
in
the
youth
of
the
race
back
in
the
beguilement
of
the
young
world
everything
is
in
this
hour
the
beauty
of
classic
myths
the
primal
charm
of
the
silent
and
the
open
the
lure
of
mystery
why
it
s
a
time
and
place
when
and
where
everything
might
come
true
when
the
men
in
green
might
creep
out
to
join
hands
and
dance
around
the
fire
or
dryads
steal
from
their
trees
to
warm
their
white
limbs
grown
chilly
in
october
frosts
by
the
blaze
i
wouldn
t
be
much
surprised
if
we
should
see
something
of
the
kind
isn
t
that
the
flash
of
an
ivory
shoulder
through
yonder
gloom
and
didn
t
you
see
a
queer
little
elfin
face
peering
at
us
around
that
twisted
gray
trunk
but
one
can
t
be
sure
mortal
eyesight
is
too
slow
and
clumsy
a
thing
to
match
against
the
flicker
of
a
hand
in
hand
we
wandered
through
that
enchanted
place
seeking
the
folk
of
and
heard
their
mystic
voices
calling
from
fairy
knoll
and
haunted
not
till
the
fire
died
down
into
ashes
did
we
leave
the
grove
then
we
found
that
the
full
moon
was
gleaming
lustrously
from
a
cloudless
sky
across
the
valley
between
us
and
her
stretched
up
a
tall
pine
wondrously
straight
and
slender
and
branchless
to
its
very
top
where
it
overflowed
in
a
crest
of
dark
boughs
against
the
silvery
splendour
behind
it
beyond
the
hill
farms
were
lying
in
a
suave
white
radiance
doesn
t
it
seem
a
long
long
time
to
you
since
we
left
home
this
afternoon
asked
the
story
girl
and
yet
it
is
only
a
few
only
a
few
hours
true
yet
such
hours
were
worth
a
cycle
of
common
years
untouched
by
the
glory
and
the
dream
chapter
xxix
we
lose
a
friend
our
beautiful
october
was
marred
by
one
day
of
black
tragedy
the
day
paddy
died
for
paddy
after
seven
years
of
as
happy
a
life
as
ever
a
cat
lived
died
suddenly
of
poison
as
was
supposed
where
he
had
wandered
in
the
darkness
to
meet
his
doom
we
did
not
know
but
in
the
frosty
dawnlight
he
dragged
himself
home
to
die
we
found
him
lying
on
the
doorstep
when
we
got
up
and
it
did
not
need
aunt
janet
s
curt
announcement
or
uncle
blair
s
reluctant
shake
of
the
head
to
tell
us
that
there
was
no
chance
of
our
pet
recovering
this
time
we
felt
that
nothing
could
be
done
lard
and
sulphur
on
his
paws
would
be
of
no
use
nor
would
any
visit
to
peg
bowen
avail
we
stood
around
in
mournful
silence
the
story
girl
sat
down
on
the
step
and
took
poor
paddy
upon
her
lap
i
s
pose
there
s
no
use
even
in
praying
now
said
cecily
desperately
it
wouldn
t
do
any
harm
to
try
sobbed
felicity
you
needn
t
waste
your
prayers
said
dan
mournfully
pat
is
beyond
human
aid
you
can
tell
that
by
his
eyes
besides
i
don
t
believe
it
was
the
praying
cured
him
last
no
it
was
peg
bowen
declared
peter
but
she
couldn
t
have
bewitched
him
this
time
for
she
s
been
away
for
months
nobody
knows
if
he
could
only
tell
us
where
he
feels
the
worst
said
cecily
piteously
it
s
so
dreadful
to
see
him
suffering
and
not
be
able
to
do
a
single
thing
to
help
him
i
don
t
think
he
s
suffering
much
now
i
said
comfortingly
the
story
girl
said
nothing
she
passed
and
repassed
her
long
brown
hand
gently
over
her
pet
s
glossy
fur
pat
lifted
his
head
and
essayed
to
creep
a
little
nearer
to
his
beloved
mistress
the
story
girl
drew
his
limp
body
close
in
her
arms
there
was
a
plaintive
little
mew
a
long
quiver
and
paddy
s
friendly
soul
had
fared
forth
to
wherever
it
is
that
good
cats
go
well
he
s
gone
said
dan
turning
his
back
abruptly
to
us
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
it
can
be
true
sobbed
cecily
this
time
yesterday
morning
he
was
full
of
he
drank
two
full
saucers
of
cream
moaned
felicity
and
i
saw
him
catch
a
mouse
in
the
evening
maybe
it
was
the
last
one
he
ever
he
did
for
many
a
mouse
in
his
day
said
peter
anxious
to
pay
his
tribute
to
the
departed
he
was
a
cat
take
him
for
all
in
all
we
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
quoted
uncle
blair
felicity
and
cecily
and
sara
ray
cried
so
much
that
aunt
janet
lost
patience
completely
and
told
them
sharply
that
they
would
have
something
to
cry
for
some
day
which
did
not
seem
to
comfort
them
much
the
story
girl
shed
no
tears
though
the
look
in
her
eyes
hurt
more
than
weeping
after
all
perhaps
it
s
for
the
best
she
said
drearily
i
ve
been
feeling
so
badly
over
having
to
go
away
and
leave
paddy
no
matter
how
kind
you
d
all
be
to
him
i
know
he
d
miss
me
terribly
he
wasn
t
like
most
cats
who
don
t
care
who
comes
and
goes
as
long
as
they
get
plenty
to
eat
paddy
wouldn
t
have
been
contented
without
oh
oh
wailed
sara
ray
lugubriously
felix
shot
a
disgusted
glance
at
her
i
don
t
see
what
you
are
making
such
a
fuss
about
he
said
unfeelingly
he
wasn
t
your
but
i
him
sobbed
sara
and
i
always
feel
bad
when
my
friends
i
wish
we
could
believe
that
cats
went
to
heaven
like
people
sighed
cecily
do
you
really
think
it
isn
t
possible
uncle
blair
shook
his
head
i
m
afraid
not
i
d
like
to
think
cats
have
a
chance
for
heaven
but
i
can
t
there
s
nothing
heavenly
about
cats
delightful
creatures
though
they
blair
i
m
really
surprised
to
hear
the
things
you
say
to
the
children
said
aunt
janet
severely
surely
you
wouldn
t
prefer
me
to
tell
them
that
cats
do
go
to
heaven
protested
uncle
blair
i
think
it
s
wicked
to
carry
on
about
an
animal
as
those
children
do
answered
aunt
janet
decidedly
and
you
shouldn
t
encourage
them
here
now
children
stop
making
a
fuss
bury
that
cat
and
get
off
to
your
apple
we
had
to
go
to
our
work
but
paddy
was
not
to
be
buried
in
any
such
fashion
as
that
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
bury
him
in
the
orchard
at
sunset
that
evening
and
sara
ray
who
had
to
go
home
declared
she
would
be
back
for
it
and
implored
us
to
wait
for
her
if
she
didn
t
come
exactly
on
time
i
mayn
t
be
able
to
get
away
till
after
milking
she
sniffed
but
i
don
t
want
to
miss
it
even
a
cat
s
funeral
is
better
than
none
at
horrid
thing
said
felicity
barely
waiting
until
sara
was
out
of
earshot
we
worked
with
heavy
hearts
that
day
the
girls
cried
bitterly
most
of
the
time
and
we
boys
whistled
defiantly
but
as
evening
drew
on
we
began
to
feel
a
sneaking
interest
in
the
details
of
the
funeral
as
dan
said
the
thing
should
be
done
properly
since
paddy
was
no
common
cat
the
story
girl
selected
the
spot
for
the
grave
in
a
little
corner
behind
the
cherry
copse
where
early
violets
enskied
the
grass
in
spring
and
we
boys
dug
the
grave
making
it
soft
and
narrow
as
the
heroine
of
the
old
ballad
wanted
hers
made
sara
ray
who
managed
to
come
in
time
after
all
and
felicity
stood
and
watched
us
but
cecily
and
the
story
girl
kept
far
aloof
this
time
last
night
you
never
thought
you
d
be
digging
pat
s
grave
sighed
felicity
we
little
what
a
day
will
bring
forth
sobbed
sara
i
ve
heard
the
minister
say
that
and
it
is
of
course
it
s
true
it
s
in
the
bible
but
i
don
t
think
you
should
repeat
it
in
connection
with
a
cat
said
felicity
dubiously
when
all
was
in
readiness
the
story
girl
brought
her
pet
through
the
orchard
where
he
had
so
often
frisked
and
prowled
no
useless
coffin
enclosed
his
breast
but
he
reposed
in
a
neat
cardboard
box
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
right
to
say
ashes
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
said
peter
no
it
wouldn
t
averred
felicity
it
would
be
real
i
think
we
ought
to
sing
a
hymn
anyway
asseverated
sara
ray
well
we
might
do
that
if
it
isn
t
a
very
religious
one
conceded
felicity
how
would
pull
for
the
shore
sailor
pull
for
the
shore
do
asked
cecily
that
never
seemed
to
me
a
very
religious
but
it
doesn
t
seem
very
appropriate
to
a
funeral
occasion
either
said
felicity
i
think
lead
kindly
light
would
be
ever
so
much
more
suitable
suggested
sara
ray
and
it
is
kind
of
soothing
and
melancholy
we
are
not
going
to
sing
anything
said
the
story
girl
coldly
do
you
want
to
make
the
affair
ridiculous
we
will
just
fill
up
the
grave
quietly
and
put
a
flat
stone
over
the
it
isn
t
much
like
my
idea
of
a
funeral
muttered
sara
ray
discontentedly
never
mind
we
re
going
to
have
a
real
obituary
about
him
in
our
magazine
whispered
cecily
consolingly
and
peter
is
going
to
cut
his
name
on
top
of
the
stone
added
felicity
only
we
mustn
t
let
on
to
the
until
it
is
done
because
they
might
say
it
wasn
t
we
left
the
orchard
a
sober
little
band
with
the
wind
of
the
gray
twilight
blowing
round
us
uncle
roger
passed
us
at
the
gate
so
the
last
sad
obsequies
are
over
he
remarked
with
a
grin
and
we
hated
uncle
roger
but
we
loved
uncle
blair
because
he
said
quietly
and
so
you
ve
buried
your
little
comrade
so
much
may
depend
on
the
way
a
thing
is
said
but
not
even
uncle
blair
s
sympathy
could
take
the
sting
out
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
paddy
to
get
the
froth
that
night
at
milking
time
felicity
cried
bitterly
all
the
time
she
was
straining
the
milk
many
human
beings
have
gone
to
their
graves
unattended
by
as
much
real
regret
as
followed
that
one
gray
pussy
cat
to
his
chapter
xxx
prophecies
here
s
a
letter
for
you
from
father
said
felix
tossing
it
to
me
as
he
came
through
the
orchard
gate
we
had
been
picking
apples
all
day
but
were
taking
a
rest
around
the
well
with
a
cup
of
its
sparkling
cold
water
to
refresh
us
i
opened
the
letter
rather
indifferently
for
father
with
all
his
excellent
and
lovable
traits
was
but
a
poor
correspondent
his
letters
were
usually
very
brief
and
very
unimportant
this
letter
was
brief
enough
but
it
was
freighted
with
a
message
of
weighty
import
i
sat
gazing
stupidly
at
the
sheet
after
i
had
read
it
until
felix
exclaimed
bev
what
s
the
matter
with
you
what
s
in
that
letter
father
is
coming
home
i
said
dazedly
he
is
to
leave
south
america
in
a
fortnight
and
will
be
here
in
november
to
take
us
back
to
everybody
gasped
sara
ray
of
course
began
to
cry
which
aggravated
me
unreasonably
well
said
felix
when
he
got
his
second
wind
i
ll
be
awful
glad
to
see
father
again
but
i
tell
you
i
don
t
like
the
thought
of
leaving
i
felt
exactly
the
same
but
in
view
of
sara
ray
s
tears
admit
it
i
would
not
so
i
sat
in
grum
silence
while
the
other
tongues
wagged
if
i
were
not
going
away
myself
i
d
feel
just
terrible
said
the
story
girl
even
as
it
is
i
m
real
sorry
i
d
like
to
be
able
to
think
of
you
as
all
here
together
when
i
m
gone
having
good
times
and
writing
me
about
it
ll
be
awfully
dull
when
you
fellows
go
muttered
dan
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
we
re
ever
going
to
do
here
this
winter
said
felicity
with
the
calmness
of
despair
thank
goodness
there
are
no
more
fathers
to
come
back
breathed
cecily
with
a
vicious
earnestness
that
made
us
all
laugh
even
in
the
midst
of
our
dismay
we
worked
very
the
rest
of
the
day
and
it
was
not
until
we
assembled
in
the
orchard
in
the
evening
that
our
spirits
recovered
something
like
their
wonted
level
it
was
clear
and
slightly
frosty
the
sun
had
declined
behind
a
birch
on
a
distant
hill
and
it
seemed
a
tree
with
a
blazing
heart
of
fire
the
great
golden
willow
at
the
lane
gate
was
in
the
wind
of
evening
even
amid
all
the
changes
of
our
shifting
world
we
could
not
be
hopelessly
except
sara
ray
who
was
often
so
and
peter
who
was
rarely
so
but
peter
had
been
sorely
vexed
in
spirit
for
several
days
the
time
was
approaching
for
the
october
issue
of
our
magazine
and
he
had
no
genuine
fiction
ready
for
it
he
had
taken
so
much
to
heart
felicity
s
taunt
that
his
stories
were
all
true
that
he
had
determined
to
have
a
false
one
in
the
next
number
but
the
difficulty
was
to
get
anyone
to
write
it
he
had
asked
the
story
girl
to
do
it
but
she
refused
then
he
appealed
to
me
and
i
shirked
finally
peter
determined
to
write
a
story
himself
it
oughtn
t
to
be
any
harder
than
writing
a
poem
and
i
managed
that
he
said
dolefully
he
worked
at
it
in
the
evenings
in
the
granary
loft
and
the
rest
of
us
forebore
to
question
him
concerning
it
because
he
evidently
disliked
talking
about
his
literary
efforts
but
this
evening
i
had
to
ask
him
if
he
would
soon
have
it
ready
as
i
wanted
to
make
up
the
paper
it
s
done
said
peter
with
an
air
of
gloomy
triumph
it
don
t
amount
to
much
but
anyhow
i
made
it
all
out
of
my
own
head
not
one
word
of
it
was
ever
printed
or
told
before
and
nobody
can
say
there

i
guess

all
the
stuff
in
and
i
ll
have
our
magazine
ready
to
read
by
tomorrow
night
i
said

the
story

on
whom
the
spirit
of
prophecy
suddenly
descended
that
night
she
was
swinging
on
the
bough
of
an
apple
tree
with
a
crimson
shawl
wrapped
about
her
head
and
her
eyes
were
bright
with
roguish
fire

felicity

the
story

fat

of

on
the
story

worse

peter
in
a
not
ungratified
tone
dan

be
a
farmer
and
will
marry
a
girl
whose
name
begins
with
k
and
he
will
have

though
i

nonsense
protested
felicity
sharply
what
on
earth
do
you
want
to
be
a
sailor
for
and
be
drowned
all
sailors
aren
t
drowned
said
dan
most
of
them
are
look
at
uncle
you
ain
t
sure
he
was
well
he
disappeared
and
that
is
how
do
you

be
real
it
s
not
very
easy
for
your
hush
let
s
hear
the
rest
of
the
predictions
said
cecily
felicity
resumed
the
story
girl
gravely
will
marry
a
sara
ray
giggled
and
felicity
blushed
peter
tried
hard
not
to
look
too
delighted
she
will
be
a
perfect
housekeeper
and
will
teach
a
sunday
school
class
and
be
very
happy
all
her
will
her
husband
be
happy
queried
dan
solemnly
i
guess
he
ll
be
as
happy
as
your
wife
retorted
felicity
reddening
he
ll
be
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
declared
peter
warmly
what
about
me
asked
sara
ray
the
story
girl
looked
rather
puzzled
it
was
so
hard
to
imagine
sara
ray
as
having
any
kind
of
future
yet
sara
was
plainly
anxious
to
have
her
fortune
told
and
must
be
gratified
you
ll
be
married
said
the
story
girl
recklessly
and
you
ll
live
to
be
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
and
go
to
dozens
of
funerals
and
have
a
great
many
sick
spells
you
will
learn
not
to
cry
after
you
are
seventy
but
your
husband
will
never
go
to
i
m
glad
you
warned
me
said
sara
ray
solemnly
because
now
i
know
i
ll
make
him
promise
before
i
marry
him
that
he
will
he
won
t
keep
the
promise
said
the
story
girl
shaking
her
head
but
it
is
getting
cold
and
cecily
is
coughing
let
us
go
you
haven
t
told
my
fortune
protested
cecily
disappointedly
the
story
girl
looked
very
tenderly
at
cecily
at
the
smooth
little
brown
head
at
the
soft
shining
eyes
at
the
cheeks
that
were
often
after
slight
exertion
at
the
little
sunburned
hands
that
were
always
busy
doing
faithful
work
or
quiet
kindnesses
a
very
strange
look
came
over
the
story
girl
s
face
her
eyes
grew
sad
and
as
if
of
a
verity
they
pierced
beyond
the
mists
of
hidden
years
i
couldn
t
tell
any
fortune
half
good
enough
for
you
dearest
she
said
slipping
her
arm
round
cecily
you
deserve
everything
good
and
lovely
but
you
know
i
ve
only
been
in
fun
of
course
i
don
t
know
anything
about
what
s
going
to
happen
to
perhaps
you
know
more
than
you
think
for
said
sara
ray
who
seemed
much
pleased
with
her
fortune
and
anxious
to
believe
it
despite
the
husband
who
wouldn
t
go
to
church
but
i
d
like
to
be
told
my
fortune
even
in
fun
persisted
cecily
everybody
you
meet
will
love
you
as
long
as
you
said
the
story
girl
there
that
s
the
very
nicest
fortune
i
can
tell
you
and
it
will
come
true
whether
the
others
do
or
not
and
now
we
must
go
we
went
cecily
still
a
little
disappointed
in
later
years
i
often
wondered
why
the
story
girl
refused
to
tell
her
fortune
that
night
did
some
strange
gleam
of
foreknowledge
fall
for
a
moment
across
her
did
she
realize
in
a
flash
of
prescience
that
there
was
no
earthly
future
for
our
sweet
cecily
not
for
her
were
to
be
the
lengthening
shadows
or
the
fading
garland
the
end
was
to
come
while
the
rainbow
still
sparkled
on
her
wine
of
life
ere
a
single
petal
had
fallen
from
her
rose
of
joy
long
life
was
before
all
the
others
who
trysted
that
night
in
the
old
homestead
orchard
but
cecily
s
maiden
feet
were
never
to
leave
the
golden
road
chapter
xxxi
the
last
number
of
our
magazine
editorial
it
is
with
heartfelt
regret
that
we
take
up
our
pen
to
announce
that
this
will
be
the
last
number
of
our
magazine
we
have
edited
ten
numbers
of
it
and
it
has
been
successful
beyond
our
expectations
it
has
to
be
discontinued
by
reason
of
circumstances
over
which
we
have
no
control
and
not
because
we
have
lost
interest
in
it
everybody
has
done
his
or
her
best
for
our
magazine
prince
edward
island
expected
everyone
to
do
his
and
her
duty
and
everyone
did
it
dan
king
conducted
the
etiquette
department
in
a
way
worthy
of
the
family
guide
itself
he
is
especially
entitled
to
commendation
because
he
laboured
under
the
disadvantage
of
having
to
furnish
most
of
the
questions
as
well
as
the
answers
miss
felicity
king
has
edited
our
helpful
household
department
very
ably
and
miss
cecily
king
s
fashion
notes
were
always
up
to
date
the
personal
column
was
well
looked
after
by
miss
sara
stanley
and
the
story
page
has
been
a
marked
success
under
the
able
management
of
peter
craig
to
whose
original
story
in
this
issue
the
battle
of
the
partridge
eggs
we
would
call
especial
attention
the
exciting
adventure
series
has
also
been
very
popular
and
now
in
closing
we
bid
farewell
to
our
staff
and
thank
them
one
and
all
for
their
help
and
in
the
past
year
we
have
enjoyed
our
work
and
we
trust
that
they
have
too
we
wish
them
all
happiness
and
success
in
years
to
come
and
we
hope
that
the
recollection
of
our
magazine
will
not
be
held
least
dear
among
the
memories
of
their
childhood
sobs
from
the
girls
indeed
it
won
t
obituary
on
october
eighteenth
patrick
grayfur
departed
for
that
bourne
whence
no
traveller
returns
he
was
only
a
cat
but
he
had
been
our
faithful
friend
for
a
long
time
and
we
aren
t
ashamed
to
be
sorry
for
him
there
are
lots
of
people
who
are
not
as
friendly
and
gentlemanly
as
paddy
was
and
he
was
a
great
mouser
we
buried
all
that
was
mortal
of
poor
pat
in
the
orchard
and
we
are
never
going
to
forget
him
we
have
resolved
that
whenever
the
date
of
his
death
comes
round
we
ll
bow
our
heads
and
pronounce
his
name
at
the
hour
of
his
funeral
if
we
are
anywhere
where
we
can
t
say
the
name
out
loud
we
ll
whisper
it
farewell
dearest
paddy
in
all
the
years
that
are
to
be
we
ll
cherish
your
memory
my
most
exciting
adventure
my
most
exciting
adventure
was
the
day
i
fell
off
uncle
roger
s
loft
two
years
ago
i
wasn
t
excited
until
it
was
all
over
because
i
hadn
t
time
to
be
the
story
girl
and
i
were
looking
for
eggs
in
the
loft
it
was
filled
with
wheat
straw
nearly
to
the
roof
and
it
was
an
awful
distance
from
us
to
the
floor
and
wheat
straw
is
so
slippery
i
made
a
little
spring
and
the
straw
slipped
from
under
my
feet
and
there
i
was
going
head
first
down
from
the
loft
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
an
awful
long
time
falling
but
the
story
girl
says
i
couldn
t
have
been
more
than
three
seconds
but
i
know
that
i
thought
five
thoughts
and
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
long
time
between
them
the
first
thing
i
thought
was
what
has
happened
because
i
really
didn
t
know
at
first
it
was
so
sudden
then
after
a
spell
i
thought
the
answer
i
am
falling
off
the
loft
and
then
i
thought
what
will
happen
to
me
when
i
strike
the
floor
and
after
another
little
spell
i
thought
i
ll
be
killed
and
then
i
thought
well
i
don
t
care
i
really
wasn
t
a
bit
frightened
i
just
was
quite
willing
to
be
killed
if
there
hadn
t
been
a
big
pile
of
chaff
on
the
barn
floor
these
words
would
never
have
been
written
but
there
was
and
i
fell
on
it
and
wasn
t
a
bit
hurt
only
my
hair
and
mouth
and
eyes
and
ears
got
all
full
of
chaff
the
strange
part
is
that
i
wasn
t
a
bit
frightened
when
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
killed
but
after
all
the
danger
was
over
i
was
awfully
frightened
and
trembled
so
the
story
girl
had
to
help
me
into
the
house
felicity
king
the
battle
of
the
partridge
eggs
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
about
half
a
mile
from
a
forrest
a
farmer
and
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
daughters
and
a
granddaughter
the
farmer
and
his
wife
loved
this
little
girl
very
much
but
she
caused
them
great
trouble
by
running
away
into
the
woods
and
they
often
spent
haf
days
looking
for
her
one
day
she
wondered
further
into
the
forrest
than
usual
and
she
begun
to
be
hungry
then
night
closed
in
she
asked
a
fox
where
she
could
get
something
to
eat
the
fox
told
her
he
knew
where
there
was
a
partridges
nest
and
a
bluejays
nest
full
of
eggs
so
he
led
her
to
the
nests
and
she
took
five
eggs
out
of
each
when
the
birds
came
home
they
missed
the
eggs
and
flew
into
a
rage
the
bluejay
put
on
his
topcoat
and
was
going
to
the
partridge
for
law
when
he
met
the
partridge
coming
to
him
they
lit
up
a
fire
and
commenced
sining
their
deeds
when
they
heard
a
tremendous
howl
close
behind
them
they
jumped
up
and
put
out
the
fire
and
were
immejutly
attacked
by
five
great
wolves
the
next
day
the
little
girl
was
rambelling
through
the
woods
when
they
saw
her
and
took
her
prisoner
after
she
had
confessed
that
she
had
stole
the
eggs
they
told
her
to
raise
an
army
they
would
have
to
fight
over
the
nests
of
eggs
and
whoever
one
would
have
the
eggs
so
the
partridge
raised
a
great
army
of
all
kinds
of
birds
except
robins
and
the
little
girl
got
all
the
robins
and
foxes
and
bees
and
wasps
and
best
of
all
the
little
girl
had
a
gun
and
plenty
of
ammunishun
the
leader
of
her
army
was
a
wolf
the
result
of
the
battle
was
that
all
the
birds
were
killed
except
the
partridge
and
the
bluejay
and
they
were
taken
prisoner
and
starved
to
death
the
little
girl
was
then
taken
prisoner
by
a
witch
and
cast
into
a
dunjun
full
of
snakes
where
she
died
from
their
bites
and
people
who
went
through
the
forrest
after
that
were
taken
prisoner
by
her
ghost
and
cast
into
the
same
dunjun
where
they
died
about
a
year
after
the
wood
turned
into
a
gold
castle
and
one
morning
everything
had
vanished
except
a
piece
of
a
tree
peter
craig
dan
with
a
whistle
well
i
guess
nobody
can
say
peter
can
t
write
fiction
after
sara
ray
wiping
away
her
tears
it
s
a
very
interesting
story
but
it
ends
so
felix
what
made
you
call
it
the
battle
of
the
partridge
eggs
when
the
bluejay
had
just
as
much
to
do
with
it
peter
shortly
because
it
sounded
better
that
felicity
did
she
eat
the
eggs
raw
sara
ray
poor
little
thing
i
suppose
if
you
re
starving
you
can
t
be
very
cecily
sighing
i
wish
you
d
let
her
go
home
safe
peter
and
not
put
her
to
such
a
cruel
beverley
i
don
t
quite
understand
where
the
little
girl
got
her
gun
and
peter
suspecting
that
he
is
being
made
fun
of
if
you
could
write
a
better
story
why
didn
t
you
i
give
you
the
the
story
girl
with
a
preternaturally
solemn
face
you
shouldn
t
criticize
peter
s
story
like
that
it
s
a
fairy
tale
you
know
and
anything
can
happen
in
a
fairy
felicity
there
isn
t
a
word
about
fairies
in
it
cecily
besides
fairy
tales
always
end
nicely
and
this
doesn
peter
sulkily
i
wanted
to
punish
her
for
running
away
from

did
it
all

was
very
interesting

is
all

xxxii
our
last
evening
together
it
was
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
the
story
girl
and
uncle
blair
were
to
leave
us
and
we
were
keeping
our
last
tryst
together
in
the
orchard
where
we
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
we
had
made
a
pilgrimage
to
all
the
old
haunts
the
hill
field
the
spruce
wood
the
dairy
grandfather
king
s
willow
the
pulpit
stone
pat
s
grave
and
uncle
stephen
s
walk
and
now
we
foregathered
in
the
sere
grasses
about
the
old
well
and
feasted
on
the
little
jam
turnovers
felicity
had
made
that
day
specially
for
the
occasion
i
wonder
if
we
ll
ever
all
be
together
again
sighed
cecily
i
wonder
when
i
ll
get
jam
turnovers
like
this
again
said
the
story
girl
trying
to
be
gay
but
not
making
much
of
a
success
of
it
if
paris
wasn
t
so
far
away
i
could
send
you
a
box
of
nice
things
now
and
then
said
felicity
forlornly
but
i
suppose
there
s
no
use
thinking
of
that
dear
knows
what
they
ll
give
you
to
eat
over
oh
the
french
have
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
cooks
in
the
world
rejoined
the
story
girl
but
i
know
they
can
t
beat
your
jam
turnovers
and
plum
puffs
felicity
many
a
time
i
ll
be
hankering
after
if
we
ever
do
meet
again
you
ll
be
grown
up
said
felicity
gloomily
well
you
won
t
have
stood
still
yourselves
you
no
but
that
s
just
the
worst
of
it
we
ll
all
be
different
and
everything
will
be
just
think
said
cecily
last
new
year
s
eve
we
were
wondering
what
would
happen
this
year
and
what
a
lot
of
things
have
happened
that
we
never
expected
oh
dear
if
things
never
happened
life
would
be
pretty
dull
said
the
story
girl
briskly
oh
don
t
look
so
dismal
all
of
it
s
hard
to
be
cheerful
when
everybody
s
going
away
sighed
cecily
well
let
s
pretend
to
be
anyway
insisted
the
story
girl
don
t
let
s
think
of
parting
let
s
think
instead
of
how
much
we
ve
laughed
this
last
year
or
so
i
m
sure
i
shall
never
forget
this
dear
old
place
we
ve
had
so
many
good
times
and
some
bad
times
too
reminded
felix
remember
when
dan
et
the
bad
berries
last
summer
and
the
time
we
were
so
scared
over
that
bell
ringing
in
the
house
grinned
peter
and
the
judgment
day
added
dan
and
the
time
paddy
was
bewitched
suggested
sara
ray
and
when
peter
was
dying
of
the
measles
said
felicity
and
the
time
jimmy
patterson
was
lost
said
dan
but
that
scared
me
out
of
a
year
s
do
you
remember
the
time
we
took
the
magic
seed
grinned
peter
weren
t
we
silly
said
felicity
i
really
can
never
look
billy
robinson
in
the
face
when
i
meet
him
i
m
always
sure
he
s
laughing
at
me
in
his
it
s
billy
robinson
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
when
he
meets
you
or
any
of
us
commented
cecily
severely
i
d
rather
be
cheated
than
cheat
other
do
you
mind
the
time
we
bought
god
s
picture
asked
peter
i
wonder
if
it
s
where
we
buried
it
yet
speculated
felix
i
put
a
stone
over
it
just
as
we
did
over
pat
said
cecily
i
wish
i
could
forget
what
god
looks
like
sighed
sara
ray
i
can
t
forget
it
and
i
can
t
forget
what
the
bad
place
is
like
either
ever
since
peter
preached
that
sermon
on
when
you
get
to
be
a
real
minister
you
ll
have
to
preach
that
sermon
over
again
peter
grinned
dan
my
aunt
jane
used
to
say
that
people
needed
a
sermon
on
that
place
once
in
a
while
retorted
peter
seriously
do
you
mind
the
night
i
et
the
cucumbers
and
milk
to
make
me
dream
said
cecily
and
therewith
we
hunted
out
our
old
dream
books
to
read
them
again
and
forgetful
of
coming
partings
laughed
over
them
till
the
old
orchard
echoed
to
our
mirth
when
we
had
finished
we
stood
in
a
circle
around
the
well
and
pledged
eternal
friendship
in
a
cup
of
its
unrivalled
water
then
we
joined
hands
and
sang
auld
lang
sara
ray
cried
bitterly
in
lieu
of
singing
look
here
said
the
story
girl
as
we
turned
to
leave
the
old
orchard
i
want
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
all
don
t
say
to
me
tomorrow
why
not
demanded
felicity
in
astonishment
because
it
s
such
a
hopeless
sort
of
word
don
t
let
s
say
it
at
all
just
see
me
off
with
a
wave
of
your
hands
it
won
t
seem
half
so
bad
then
and
don
t
any
of
you
cry
if
you
can
help
it
i
want
to
remember
you
all
we
went
out
of
the
old
orchard
where
the
autumn
night
wind
was
beginning
to
make
its
weird
music
in
the
russet
boughs
and
shut
the
little
gate
behind
us
our
revels
there
were
ended
chapter
xxxiii
the
story
girl
goes
the
morning
dawned
rosy
and
clear
and
frosty
everybody
was
up
early
for
the
travellers
must
leave
in
time
to
catch
the
nine
o
clock
train
the
horse
was
harnessed
and
uncle
alec
was
waiting
by
the
door
aunt
janet
was
crying
but
everybody
else
was
making
a
valiant
effort
not
to
the
awkward
man
and
dale
came
to
see
the
last
of
their
favourite
dale
had
brought
her
a
glorious
sheaf
of
chrysanthemums
and
the
awkward
man
gave
her
quite
gracefully
another
little
old
limp
book
from
his
library
read
it
when
you
are
sad
or
happy
or
lonely
or
discouraged
or
hopeful
he
said
gravely
he
has
really
improved
very
much
since
he
got
married
whispered
felicity
to
me
sara
stanley
wore
a
smart
new
travelling
suit
and
a
blue
felt
hat
with
a
white
feather
she
looked
so
horribly
grown
up
in
it
that
we
felt
as
if
she
were
lost
to
us
already
sara
ray
had
vowed
tearfully
the
night
before
that
she
would
be
up
in
the
morning
to
say
farewell
but
at
this
juncture
judy
pineau
appeared
to
say
that
sara
with
her
usual
luck
had
a
sore
throat
and
that
her
mother
consequently
would
not
permit
her
to
come
so
sara
had
written
her
parting
words
in
a
pink
note
my
own
darling
friend
words
can
not
express
my
feelings
over
not
being
able
to
go
up
this
morning
to
say
to
one
i
so
fondly
adore
when
i
think
that
i
can
not
see
you
again
my
heart
is
almost
too
full
for
utterance
but
mother
says
i
can
not
and
i
must
obey
but
i
will
be
present
in
spirit
it
just
breaks
my
heart
that
you
are
going
so
far
away
you
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
and
never
hurt
my
feelings
as
some
do
and
i
shall
miss
you
so
much
but
i
earnestly
hope
and
pray
that
you
will
be
happy
and
prosperous
wherever
your
lot
is
cast
and
not
be
seasick
on
the
great
ocean
i
hope
you
will
find
time
among
your
many
duties
to
write
me
a
letter
once
in
a
while
i
shall
always
remember
you
and
please
remember
me
i
hope
we
will
meet
again
sometime
but
if
not
may
we
meet
in
a
far
better
world
where
there
are
no
sad
partings
your
true
and
loving
friend
sara
ray
poor
little
sara
said
the
story
girl
with
a
queer
catch
in
her
voice
as
she
slipped
the
note
into
her
pocket
she
isn
t
a
bad
little
soul
and
i
m
sorry
i
couldn
t
see
her
once
more
though
maybe
it
s
just
as
well
for
she
d
have
to
cry
and
set
us
all
off
i
won
t
cry
felicity
don
t
you
dare
oh
you
dear
darling
people
i
love
you
all
so
much
and
i
ll
go
on
loving
you
mind
you
write
us
every
week
at
the
very
least
said
felicity
winking
furiously
blair
blair
watch
over
the
child
well
said
aunt
janet
remember
she
has
no
the
story
girl
ran
over
to
the
buggy
and
climbed
in
uncle
blair
followed
her
her
arms
were
full
of
dale
s
chrysanthemums
held
close
up
to
her
face
and
her
beautiful
eyes
shone
softly
at
us
over
them
no
were
said
as
she
wished
we
all
smiled
bravely
and
waved
our
hands
as
they
drove
out
of
the
lane
and
down
the
moist
red
road
into
the
shadows
of
the
fir
wood
in
the
valley
but
we
still
stood
there
for
we
knew
we
should
see
the
story
girl
once
more
beyond
the
fir
wood
was
an
open
curve
in
the
road
and
she
had
promised
to
wave
a
last
farewell
as
they
passed
around
it
we
watched
the
curve
in
silence
standing
in
a
sorrowful
little
group
in
the
sunshine
of
the
autumn
morning
the
delight
of
the
world
had
been
ours
on
the
golden
road
it
had
enticed
us
with
daisies
and
rewarded
us
with
roses
blossom
and
lyric
had
waited
on
our
wishes
thoughts
careless
and
sweet
had
visited
us
laughter
had
been
our
comrade
and
fearless
hope
our
guide
but
now
the
shadow
of
change
was
over
it
there
she
is
cried
felicity
the
story
girl
stood
up
and
waved
her
chrysanthemums
at
us
we
waved
wildly
back
until
the
buggy
had
driven
around
the
curve
then
we
went
slowly
and
silently
back
to
the
house
the
story
girl
was
gone
